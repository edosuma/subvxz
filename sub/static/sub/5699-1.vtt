00:30.163 --> 00:33.644
As I explained on the phone,
our coffins are made in France.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.348
Solid wood, timeless models
and handcrafted finishes.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.026
As for the type of wood,
we have oak, beech and mahogany.

00:41.274 --> 00:44.869
Our selection is available
in 0.7 or 0.85 inch width.

00:45.011 --> 00:48.310
It's important because your father
wanted to be cremated.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.517
The wood you use
doesn't justify your prices.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.566
Your stuff is all recycled.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.550
Ash.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.114
Ash would be nice.

00:57.323 --> 01:00.190
They don't have ash.
Even the oak is Class D.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.156
Look at the knots.

01:02.862 --> 01:05.126
If that's prime cut, I'll be damned.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.993
You're right, it's Class D.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.730
This is disgusting.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.121
Dad would roll over in his grave.

02:50.103 --> 02:56.235
LOVE AT FIRsT FIGHT

Discover 10,000 jobs

03:10.857 --> 03:12.791
Come in for a career presentation,

03:13.026 --> 03:15.722
have a personalized interview
and evaluation.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.294
Win T-shirts and blow-up mattresses!

03:19.499 --> 03:22.468
Only a few more days
to meet our career advisors!

03:22.702 --> 03:25.489
Otherwise dial 3240 and say "Army."

03:25.772 --> 03:27.558
When you enlist, we commit.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.900
Dial 3240 and say "Army."

03:56.135 --> 03:57.750
Push harder!

03:58.338 --> 03:59.430
Use your hands!

04:01.207 --> 04:02.538
It took you long enough.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.926
The guy wanted to enlist me.
They must be hard up.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.874
- What did you get?
- A blow-up mattress.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.869
I whipped his ass.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.214
He's 12 years old.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.277
No way, he's at least 14.

04:19.524 --> 04:20.856
Arnaud Labréde!

04:22.195 --> 04:24.129
Oh yeah, we signed you up.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.761
You're kidding me.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.853
Labréde? He's not here?

04:33.873 --> 04:35.124
I'm not fighting a girl.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.267
No one's fighting anyone.
This is self-defense.

04:38.845 --> 04:42.167
Hitting is off-limits
so there's nothing to be afraid oi.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.132
I'm not afraid...

04:44.384 --> 04:45.749
Come on, dude.

04:57.597 --> 04:58.723
Shake hands.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.251
Come on, fight back!

05:20.987 --> 05:22.443
Fight back, it's not over.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.441
What a humiliation, bro!

05:33.800 --> 05:35.085
Bravo, young man.

05:36.803 --> 05:37.633
You okay?

05:38.104 --> 05:39.924
Don't forget your brochure, miss.

05:40.139 --> 05:40.969
You almost ate it.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.237
Did you bite her or what?

05:43.509 --> 05:44.157
No.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.107
I did an armlock.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.595
If that's what girls are like this year,
long live France!

06:05.031 --> 06:05.952
Arnaud?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.133
The door is locked.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.395
I'm taking a bath. What do you want?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.704
It's not easy to talk through a door!

06:15.708 --> 06:17.232
We'll talk later, Morn.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.971
Does the breeze bother you?

06:32.959 --> 06:36.759
I thought you were spending
summer vacation with Xavier and Victor.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.993
But Manu says
you're staying here to work.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.189
Were you planning on telling me?

06:44.704 --> 06:45.659
Of course I was.

06:46.372 --> 06:50.024
I thought I'd help out
and start learning the trade.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.463
In the current context,
it's a serious commitment.

06:54.013 --> 06:54.866
Do you understand?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.394
You think I'm not committed enough?

06:57.984 --> 07:01.067
What I mean is that you're free
to look elsewhere.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.288
Contact other companies or whatever.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.635
The important thing is to plan ahead.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.020
I don't want to plan ahead,
I want to work here.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.420
You see?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.359
He shouldn't leave now anyhow.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.325
Our new catalogue.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.963
We might not be a big company,

07:17.570 --> 07:20.653
but with some good PH
orders will pour in this summer.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.462
Right, Arnaud?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.155
Cool.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.299
Our garden shelters are all unique.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.031
For your home, I would suggest

07:34.253 --> 07:36.733
either the Rochelais or the Panama.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.358
The photos give you a rough idea.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.823
We adapt the structure
to your home,

07:42.061 --> 07:43.722
your desires and your needs.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.329
The important thing is overall harmony.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.061
Madeleine?
Could you come here a second?

07:51.537 --> 07:53.801
Sweetheart,
which one do you like best?

07:59.378 --> 08:02.734
You don't have to buy one.
They're used to rejection.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.912
- Madeleine!
- It's true.

08:05.117 --> 08:08.143
If you want to buy something useless,
don't ask me.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.386
Our products are factory-made
and guaranteed for 5 years.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.924
Cut the salesman crap.

08:15.127 --> 08:18.278
You'd never say: "Our sheds are shit
AND they fall apart!"

08:18.464 --> 08:20.796
Even if they were of gold,
they're dumb.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.853
Are you a landscaping expert?

08:23.102 --> 08:26.219
Tell us which one you like best,
not your life story!

08:26.439 --> 08:27.451
Drop it, Arnaud.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.477
What about that one?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.375
That's the one I like best.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.698
We'll let you think it over.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.606
Maybe it wasn't against you.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.089
Maybe she doesn't like wood.

08:48.294 --> 08:53.095
She did it on purpose.
She made me look like a total moron.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.496
Who gives a shit?
You sold your hut, end of story.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.823
Your thing is beeping.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.120
Shit.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.097
It's fucking infested here.

09:12.818 --> 09:14.968
Catfish eat up all the diversity.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.371
Soon there'll be nothing else left.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.181
Son-of-a-bitch catfish.

09:59.398 --> 10:00.831
Want some help?

10:05.371 --> 10:06.736
You want some help?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.064
I didn't bust it.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.045
Of course you didn't bust it.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.905
It's like if I did this.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.600
You have to visualize your target

10:24.223 --> 10:26.589
as if it were 12 inches behind itself.

10:27.693 --> 10:28.705
You get it?

10:29.528 --> 10:30.381
No.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.494
You have to strike beyond your target.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.794
Beyond your target.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.180
You get it now?

11:10.903 --> 11:11.995
I can't be here

11:12.238 --> 11:14.263
and out there hustling for clients.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.400
Put it down here.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.772
It's gross.

11:24.016 --> 11:28.373
So I thought that...
I'd let you do it yourself.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.202
I'm going to work alone?

11:30.623 --> 11:32.602
It'll be a good experience.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.658
If word gets around,
we'll be overrun with orders.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.549
It's no big deal, you know.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.316
It's like Lego building blocks.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.409
We'll probably need to hire on.

11:50.609 --> 11:52.304
The sky's the limit.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.162
What's she doing with my roof tiles?

12:12.398 --> 12:13.979
She's really nuts.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.856
Yeah, she's kind of weird.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.366
Totally off the hook is more like it-.

12:23.342 --> 12:24.775
Good luck, bro.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.942
Do you have a vegetable garden?
For the earthworms.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.681
Are you spying on me?

13:06.418 --> 13:07.703
You swim weird.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.013
It's not weird, it's the combat swim.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.951
- What?
- Combat swim. Drop it.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.319
I'm sorry I bit you the other day.

13:19.532 --> 13:23.161
If there's anything I can do to make up,
just let me know.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.880
Goddammit!

14:50.289 --> 14:52.109
Are you trying to drown it?

14:54.226 --> 14:55.477
Make yourself at home.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.164
What do you want me to do?

15:11.543 --> 15:14.330
You can adopt it.
Ferrets are easy to tame.

15:14.847 --> 15:15.802
That's a ferret?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.027
A baby ferret.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.937
He'll love you like a morn.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.881
Like a morn?
Animals don't have emotions.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.205
If you die,
your cat will eat your face after 3 days.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.824
We'll turn him loose.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.393
He's too little.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.747
He stinks of chlorine,
his mother would reject him.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.215
He'd die instantly in nature.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.757
I can't keep it.
I'm joining the army in september.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.524
Permanently?

15:46.245 --> 15:47.496
Then I'll keep it.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.543
We're so crashing the party.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.617
No, it's not.
No one told us not to come.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.890
Excuse me,
you know a babe named Violet?

16:00.359 --> 16:01.519
No?

16:02.027 --> 16:03.278
Thanks anyhow.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.157
Saskatoon, in saskatchewan.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.288
What cartoon?

16:10.569 --> 16:11.854
Saskatoon.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.684
I thought you were going to Canada.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.238
That is Canada.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.643
Why the hell are you going there?

16:18.911 --> 16:20.401
It's better than here.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.938
I'm rotting away here.
France is dead.

16:23.248 --> 16:25.876
Get real. There's no future here.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.673
So you're not coming back?

16:28.921 --> 16:31.788
Depends what happens.
At least I'll learn English.

16:31.957 --> 16:36.610
You don't have to go that far.
There must be shitholes in England too.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.441
He's right.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.154
The idea isn't to stay close.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.879
- What is the idea?
- Yeah, what is the idea?

16:46.238 --> 16:47.671
I'll be right back.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.226
Victor doesn't give a shit about us.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.946
We take an interest in his stuff
and he just walks off-.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.200
The two of us by the BBQ... ...

17:01.420 --> 17:04.901
This is a preview of what it'll be like
when he splits.

17:05.491 --> 17:06.287
Oh yeah?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.459
It'll be just the two of us-.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.089
But we'll stick together.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.083
Did you know...

17:14.366 --> 17:17.665
that your cat will eat your face
after 3 days?

17:25.844 --> 17:27.128
Here we go.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.831
This will fall apart in ten years' time.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.390
This is what we need.

17:41.794 --> 17:42.954
You don't give a shit?

17:43.462 --> 17:44.895
Can we get this?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.292
What for?

17:49.134 --> 17:50.954
To make a cage for the ferret.

17:54.206 --> 17:57.858
- Your name, please?
- Labréde. L-A-B-R-E-D-E.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.501
I have a Mr. Eric Labrede registered
for the same company.

18:05.217 --> 18:07.071
That's not us. It was our father.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.967
You want me to transfer
his loyalty points to your account?

18:11.190 --> 18:12.316
What should I do?

18:13.559 --> 18:14.719
What do you say?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.353
What do I do?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.524
How should I know? Arnaud?

18:23.735 --> 18:26.761
I don't know. Take them.
They'll be lost otherwise.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.337
Okay.
It'll pay for your netting.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.332
- We'll take them.
- Okay.

18:58.270 --> 18:58.952
Hey.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.136
How's it going?

19:02.808 --> 19:03.786
Things coming along?

19:06.078 --> 19:07.329
Yeah.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.914
I've almost finished the frame.

19:10.716 --> 19:15.005
You know, pillars like these can support
a very large amount of weight-.

19:15.621 --> 19:16.781
Great.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.582
You know where the soldiers are?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.022
The truck over at the lake is gone.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.597
I know, they left.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.969
They've moved on to the next town.

19:33.939 --> 19:35.099
Never mind.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.236
You want me to take you?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.251
I'll get a helmet.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.202
Fuck!

21:02.728 --> 21:04.013
Don't get all mad.

21:12.671 --> 21:13.797
I want to sign up.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.298
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.520
For starters,
take your helmets off.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.092
Arnaud!

21:25.117 --> 21:26.209
I didn't recognize you.

21:28.186 --> 21:28.868
Well?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.340
Has it sunk in yet?

21:34.192 --> 21:36.171
Let's say that, now I can see...

21:36.595 --> 21:38.745
better beyond stuff.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.615
Can't you help her? It's important.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.432
This is fucked.

22:41.993 --> 22:44.621
Army Preparation Camp
1st Parachute Dragoon Regiment

22:48.433 --> 22:50.890
Are you enlisting
or going to summer camp?

22:51.870 --> 22:56.125
For the regiment I want to join,
you have to take a preparation course.

23:00.345 --> 23:03.132
You have to take a course
to join the army?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.051
I thought you just showed up.

23:08.286 --> 23:12.416
It depends on the regiment.
The one I want is super hard.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.649
Super hard, like what?

23:17.396 --> 23:19.876
Super hard,
like you sweat your guts out.

23:20.132 --> 23:23.101
If you want to sleep, you dig a hole.

23:23.301 --> 23:24.552
There's physical combat.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.159
You have to swim
with 60 lbs. On your back.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.590
You ever swim with Rangers?

23:29.875 --> 23:30.455
No.

23:31.710 --> 23:35.009
There's an entrance exam.
You have to eat a raw sardine.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.364
First the head,
then the eyes, entrails and scales.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.241
That's what you want to do?

23:40.552 --> 23:42.531
They have the best survival techniques.

23:42.888 --> 23:44.469
After that, I'll be prepared.

23:45.657 --> 23:46.942
Prepared for what?

23:48.393 --> 23:49.644
To survive.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.742
I got that. But survive what?

24:07.179 --> 24:08.942
How do you know the recruiter?

24:09.681 --> 24:11.615
Maybe I'm interested too.

24:13.919 --> 24:14.874
Oh yeah?

24:15.086 --> 24:18.055
We talked one day.
He showed me some technical stuff.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.482
Like what?

24:20.025 --> 24:20.878
Stuff.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.088
Stop playing Mr. Mystery Man.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.394
You ever heard
oi "double visualization"?

24:38.276 --> 24:40.369
You're going to hit my shoulder.

24:40.645 --> 24:44.399
You need to double visualize
my shoulder 12 inches behind itself.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.976
In other words,
as it there were another me behind me.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.232
You visualize him but you hit...

24:52.824 --> 24:54.917
I think I double visualized you well.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.388
You dislocated my shoulder.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.442
Your turn.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.550
I don't hit girls.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.431
Oh yeah, I forgot. You bite them.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.558
I think it's raining less.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.372
Son of.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.269
Can you explain this shit?
Where were you?

26:33.858 --> 26:35.473
Answer me! Where were you?

26:37.062 --> 26:40.714
You fucked up!
For once I give you some responsibility!

26:40.932 --> 26:44.231
Importation of 23% in volume
and the French only 8%,

26:44.436 --> 26:47.189
a trend that solidifies the colossal
German trade surplus,

26:47.405 --> 26:49.703
which means they sell more
than they buy abroad,

26:49.908 --> 26:52.570
which is the opposite tor the French.
Since 2005, as a matter of fact...

27:40.925 --> 27:43.951
I'm Madeleine Beaulieu.
Your sons are working at my place.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.029
Oh, yes. Good evening.

27:46.931 --> 27:50.196
I brought you a present
to make up for the storm and all.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.432
That's very sweet. Thank you.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.097
Should I take it?

27:56.574 --> 27:58.394
It's baby chicks for the ferret.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.877
- Baby chicks?
- Don't worry, they're dead.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.297
They're frozen. It's more practical.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.814
I got them at a chicken breeding farm.

28:07.185 --> 28:10.302
They sell their losses
to dry dogfood companies.

28:11.156 --> 28:14.455
Powdered baby milk isn't good
for ferrets. They eat meat.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.618
They need solids,
otherwise you change their nature.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.454
That's what dogfood does.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.382
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

28:27.005 --> 28:28.131
It's sweet of you.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.758
Will you stay for dinner?

28:30.642 --> 28:32.667
No, I just came
to give you the present.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.141
I insist. It would make me very happy.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.376
I'll put this in the fridge.

28:38.650 --> 28:39.833
The freezer.

28:43.955 --> 28:45.047
Hey.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.359
Can you imagine a fire in here?

29:07.812 --> 29:11.077
Your mom invited me for dinner.
You don't mind?

29:12.851 --> 29:13.772
No.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.747
You put him in here? Not bad.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.646
You make coffins too?

29:30.068 --> 29:31.854
No, that was for my dad.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.694
They were all ugly
so we said we'd make our own.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.206
But you need a special license.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.897
We didn't have enough time.

29:42.413 --> 29:44.779
Now we don't know what to do with it.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.666
It's not bothering anyone.

29:49.921 --> 29:51.013
No.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.083
Are you in college?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.316
I have a Master's
in economic modeling.

30:00.265 --> 30:01.755
And what's that for?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.857
The idea is to anticipate future events

30:05.069 --> 30:06.923
in order to adapt to them now.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.293
But since future events won't exist,
it's pointless.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.289
I dropped out this year.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.842
I can understand.

30:14.078 --> 30:16.444
Years of college
with no job guarantee...

30:16.881 --> 30:18.496
The recession, unemployment...

30:18.716 --> 30:19.876
It's not easy.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.874
There's far worse in store
than unemployment.

30:23.087 --> 30:26.511
But since we only focus on trivia,
we don't see it coming.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.777
What don't we see coming?

30:29.494 --> 30:30.859
The end.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.676
The end of what?

30:33.898 --> 30:35.354
"The end." Our extinction.

30:36.301 --> 30:37.097
Oh, I see.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.417
What should we look out for?

30:39.971 --> 30:41.586
Take your pick.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.263
Hunger strikes, religious wars,

30:43.808 --> 30:45.469
drought, global warming,

30:45.677 --> 30:48.612
inversion of the poles,
nuclear plants blowing up...

30:48.780 --> 30:52.580
Or epidemics.
That respiratory thing you can't cure.

30:52.784 --> 30:53.580
Coronavirus?

30:54.752 --> 30:56.720
Its prevalence is dropping so...

30:56.855 --> 30:58.311
we watch TV too.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.344
And you like this idea?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.456
Not particularly.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.551
But we're responsible for it all.

31:06.764 --> 31:09.790
Me, in my backyard, I'm responsible
for your end of the world?

31:10.001 --> 31:13.084
What are EU forest industry subsidies?

31:13.338 --> 31:14.350
67.

31:14.606 --> 31:15.561
67%.

31:15.773 --> 31:18.708
For nothing.
We create imbalances everywhere.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.869
And you left college to deal with this?
Makes sense.

31:22.113 --> 31:23.694
I wanted time to prepare.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.213
So what should we do?

31:25.483 --> 31:28.634
Dig holes and bury our provisions
like the Mormons?

31:29.988 --> 31:32.354
- In your opinion?
- You're the expert.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.945
How long will the Mormons hold out?
Three months?

31:37.161 --> 31:38.446
- More.
- Six months?

31:38.663 --> 31:40.449
They'll hold out for one year.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.451
That's a lot of food.

31:42.667 --> 31:43.918
Lots of canned beans.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.600
And what happens after one year?

31:48.072 --> 31:49.232
I'm asking you.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.642
You're back where you started-.

31:52.877 --> 31:54.697
You haven't solved the problem.

31:56.681 --> 31:58.342
Your Mormons will croak.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.332
They'll all kick the bucket.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.476
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- Not at all.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.484
We'll see who's crazy
in ten years' time.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.428
I think it's depressing.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.225
And you, Arnaud?

32:18.503 --> 32:19.481
What?

32:19.704 --> 32:21.399
What do you think?

32:24.242 --> 32:25.493
I don't know.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.993
Kids do feel insecure nowadays.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.401
It's a recession.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.195
Not that.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.235
Her end-of-the-world thing.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.848
If you look around,
things are pretty dismal.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.621
This is cheerful.

32:43.227 --> 32:44.842
The chicken is delicious.

33:20.798 --> 33:21.753
Here.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.923
You should start off with less weight.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.969
Like they say on the website:

33:36.748 --> 33:39.535
I was wondering, are you busy tonight?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.803
I'm going out with the guys
and if you wanted to come...

33:45.323 --> 33:46.301
what for?

33:46.958 --> 33:50.439
I don't know. But since you're leaving
for camp on Monday...

33:53.097 --> 33:54.348
whatever.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.823
Okay, cool.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.972
- You don't want your lemon?
- It's all yours.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.152
- And the mint leaves?
- Go for it.

34:19.623 --> 34:20.955
Where's Xavier?

34:23.161 --> 34:24.742
You want to dance?

34:26.230 --> 34:28.983
The poor things don't even know
why they're here.

34:30.835 --> 34:31.995
They're having fun.

34:32.203 --> 34:34.683
They're dancing and enjoying themselves.

34:34.906 --> 34:35.884
Yeah, sure.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.828
Crowding around under three spotlights
is totally retarded.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.996
They're having fun!

34:42.213 --> 34:43.190
Oh really?

34:43.581 --> 34:45.560
Hey, are you having fun?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.409
You having fun?

34:48.351 --> 34:50.831
There you go. Everyone's fucking bored.

34:52.223 --> 34:54.851
At least they're making an effort.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.293
They have a little respect.

34:57.495 --> 34:58.678
Respect?

34:58.896 --> 35:01.353
Yeah, respect tor the club.
For other people.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.316
You could've made an effort too-.

35:04.669 --> 35:07.183
You could've worn a skin
or put your hair up.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.828
I bet you look good in skirts.

35:14.612 --> 35:15.442
What?

35:15.713 --> 35:18.910
I tried to imagine you
out there dancing in a skirt.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.448
Fuck you too!

35:20.718 --> 35:23.232
- I can be a dance floor slut too.
- Go ahead.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.420
Shit, dude, I'm fucking horny.

35:31.062 --> 35:31.915
A beer?

35:34.432 --> 35:36.400
- How do you do that?
- What?

35:38.102 --> 35:39.080
By hurting myself.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.315
You want to try?

35:43.074 --> 35:44.564
Hold it tight. Bite down.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.327
Pull it back.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.396
Is that your hardest?

36:47.038 --> 36:48.619
Is that your hardest?

36:51.943 --> 36:53.729
You asshole, that hurt.

36:55.112 --> 36:57.865
Knock it off,
you're giving me a headache.

37:23.708 --> 37:24.959
You're not coming?

37:25.176 --> 37:26.541
No, I'm going home.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.572
Bye.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.276
This feels so fucking good!

37:36.554 --> 37:37.839
Just like yo mama!

37:44.895 --> 37:46.590
His girlfriend's not coming in?

37:46.998 --> 37:49.023
I wanted to see her naked!

38:45.956 --> 38:47.082
"Army."- .

38:48.492 --> 38:49.743
"Army."- .

38:55.566 --> 38:56.521
Hello.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.601
I was wondering

38:58.836 --> 39:02.351
whether it's still possible
to sign up for your training camp?

39:03.074 --> 39:05.406
The 1st Parachute Dragoon Regiment.

39:12.316 --> 39:14.910
Remember the army truck at the lake?

39:15.119 --> 39:16.609
Throw me the strap.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.675
They're offering
a free 2-week training course.

39:19.957 --> 39:23.074
The army is hard up.
It's the No. 1 recruiter in France.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.263
Number 2. The first is McDonald's.

39:30.434 --> 39:31.617
I thought about it.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.319
I enrolled.

39:34.271 --> 39:37.092
I won't be able to work with you
over the summer.

39:41.011 --> 39:42.342
You're joking, right?

39:43.547 --> 39:45.913
It's only training camp.
I didn't enlist.

39:58.729 --> 40:02.153
I don't get it.
You got a sudden urge to join the army?

40:03.734 --> 40:05.884
They have over 400 professions.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.669
There's lots of opportunities
for guys like me.

40:08.973 --> 40:12.568
You can get your driver's license
and they even have carpentry.

40:12.743 --> 40:16.042
I don't give a shit if they teach you
how to do macramé.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.512
Two worksites start next week
and this one's late.

40:20.651 --> 40:22.141
It's cool. We're almost done.

40:22.353 --> 40:25.322
No, it's not cool!
How am I supposed to manage alone?

40:28.826 --> 40:31.124
I'm busting my ass to save the company.

40:31.328 --> 40:32.989
I smoke twice as much as Morn!

40:33.197 --> 40:35.791
And you decide to walk out on me?
Are you crazy?

40:36.033 --> 40:37.796
You don't give a shit or what?

40:54.685 --> 40:58.314
Avoid piercing the entrails
or letting the knife slip.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.482
It's a tough task,
especially in this heat...

41:01.725 --> 41:04.182
Is it because I said
you should plan ahead?

41:05.930 --> 41:06.783
Is that it?

41:07.631 --> 41:09.417
I'll be back in two weeks, Mom.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.728
I've been carving up this creature
for over an hour...

41:16.974 --> 41:18.669
You'll keep your hair, won't you?

41:18.943 --> 41:21.400
...and its skin
is already starting to dry up.

41:21.612 --> 41:26.060
The Berbers can use this
as an emergency shelter in sand storms.

41:26.283 --> 41:29.036
Slip inside, fold the top over...

41:31.288 --> 41:33.745
and you're totally protected
from the sand!

42:01.685 --> 42:02.845
Surprise.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.854
What are you doing here?

42:07.625 --> 42:09.411
I'm doing the course, like you.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.512
The recruiter called me back-
He said I should grab the opportunity-.

42:17.835 --> 42:19.018
Did you see that?

42:31.515 --> 42:33.631
It happens all the time in the summer.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.057
We're stopping at every hole in France.

42:45.462 --> 42:46.588
I swear to God.

42:46.797 --> 42:48.765
No one's even getting on.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.470
Yes, there is.

43:03.380 --> 43:04.472
P.D. R?

43:06.917 --> 43:07.747
Yeah.

43:08.352 --> 43:09.603
Is this your first camp?

43:09.887 --> 43:10.842
Not you?

43:11.088 --> 43:12.100
It's my third.

43:12.356 --> 43:14.506
- Did you learn anything useful?
- Yeah.

43:14.725 --> 43:17.478
You learn a lot about yourself
and group management.

43:17.695 --> 43:19.026
Anything technical?

43:19.863 --> 43:20.955
Technical?

43:21.198 --> 43:25.157
With the mountain infantry, we learned
to pee on ourselves in avalanches.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.033
What for?

43:28.238 --> 43:29.603
To find the slope.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.501
Otherwise you don't know.

43:31.709 --> 43:35.133
The way the liquid flows
shows you which way to dig.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.160
That's cool.
I wouldn't have thought of it.

43:43.354 --> 43:44.844
It's a great adventure.

43:52.730 --> 43:53.708
Good evening.

43:55.032 --> 43:58.001
I'm Lieutenant schlieter.
Welcome to the 1st PDR.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.456
As I'm sure you already know,

44:00.771 --> 44:03.069
a fire has broken out in the region.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.390
The regiment was mobilized
to evacuate residential zones.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.511
That's a soldier's duty too!

44:08.646 --> 44:10.614
I'll get straight to the point.

44:10.814 --> 44:13.931
Your rooms aren't ready.
You'll sleep in the gymnasium.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.197
Are there any non-males amongst you?

44:17.755 --> 44:18.551
I'll ask again.

44:19.156 --> 44:22.273
We have no co-ed dormitories.
Are there any girls here?

44:23.761 --> 44:24.739
Yes.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.896
Step forward, young ladies.

44:38.842 --> 44:39.695
I want no

44:40.511 --> 44:41.637
problems...

44:42.279 --> 44:43.439
with sex...

44:46.650 --> 44:47.935
because of you.

44:50.087 --> 44:51.372
Is that clear?

44:54.425 --> 44:55.517
Very well.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.714
You over there. Take your cap off!

45:01.632 --> 45:04.499
- Officer Ruiz, take over.
- Thank you, sir.

45:05.002 --> 45:07.869
Okay.
Men, you head over to the gym.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.798
Follow me, ladies.
I'll show you your rooms.

45:25.889 --> 45:28.187
Give it to me. I'll show you.

45:30.327 --> 45:33.319
They tit together along the grooves.

45:33.530 --> 45:34.508
Okay.

45:34.698 --> 45:37.178
Last year, we did it in the dark.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.164
Now I can do it eyes closed.

45:40.671 --> 45:41.763
Cool.

45:46.376 --> 45:47.627
One, you fit it in.

45:49.012 --> 45:49.842
And two.

45:52.149 --> 45:53.161
Here.

45:56.353 --> 45:58.617
- What field do you want to work in?
- Me?

45:58.756 --> 46:01.054
I'd like to work in telecommunications.

46:01.325 --> 46:03.919
Radio frequencies and technical stuff.

46:04.561 --> 46:06.051
I want to fight.

46:06.330 --> 46:07.183
Oh yeah?

46:08.098 --> 46:09.349
What about you?

46:10.567 --> 46:12.353
I didn't imagine beds like this.

46:13.670 --> 46:14.796
What did you expect?

46:15.005 --> 46:17.633
I thought they'd be old and rotten.

46:17.775 --> 46:20.528
At least they're ugly and they squeak.

46:21.044 --> 46:23.376
- Lights off?
- It's only ten o'clock.

46:23.881 --> 46:25.860
You've got muscle tone.
What do you do?

46:26.083 --> 46:27.664
Macroeconomics. Good night.

47:02.553 --> 47:03.713
Here.

47:15.299 --> 47:16.277
How's it going?

47:17.467 --> 47:20.493
Lift your arm,
index finger facing the horizon.

47:21.605 --> 47:22.970
It's a little trick.

47:23.340 --> 47:26.161
It's not super precise,
but it's better than nothing.

47:26.910 --> 47:28.878
How far is the corn field?

47:29.513 --> 47:31.538
You said to multiply by what?

47:32.649 --> 47:33.775
115 feet.

47:41.158 --> 47:42.284
It's okay.

47:42.492 --> 47:43.675
What do we do now?

47:43.861 --> 47:45.385
Nothing. We go home.

47:56.940 --> 47:58.874
One last example.

48:03.547 --> 48:07.870
This time it's a critical situation-
You need to make a fast decision.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.572
Comeon.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.970
- Create a diversion.
- Not bad.

48:12.189 --> 48:14.521
Forget about diversions. You charge.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.349
"Operation Last Chance."
Like Call of Duty.

48:17.561 --> 48:21.008
No! You have your pals with you.

48:22.132 --> 48:24.646
Your comrades.
So no Kamikaze moves.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.503
You there. What would you do?

48:27.704 --> 48:29.319
- Me?
- Yes, you.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.000
Clear out?

48:33.844 --> 48:35.334
Sounds like a good idea.

48:36.313 --> 48:37.325
You disperse.

48:38.715 --> 48:40.171
Now that's interesting.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.720
That's interesting. You do not run!

48:43.887 --> 48:47.209
You re-de-ploy.

48:47.858 --> 48:49.439
We're listening. What next?

48:50.994 --> 48:52.245
That's all.

48:52.663 --> 48:54.096
Each man for himself.

48:56.900 --> 48:58.231
I wasn't thinking of that.

48:59.269 --> 49:00.452
Trainee Peretli.

49:00.871 --> 49:03.465
- We change the rules of the game.
- Why?

49:03.674 --> 49:05.642
- To get the upper hand, sir.
- That's it!

49:06.076 --> 49:07.441
Get the upper hand!

49:07.678 --> 49:09.976
What he just said is very important.

49:10.180 --> 49:12.478
Get the upper hand!
It's the heart of our doctrine-.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.709
If you learn one thing here,
make sure it's that.

49:16.887 --> 49:18.218
Get the upper hand.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.720
15-minute cigarette break.

49:22.292 --> 49:23.816
Excuse me, sir.

49:24.027 --> 49:26.325
How do you concretely
get the upper hand?

49:26.563 --> 49:27.689
Technically speaking.

49:27.864 --> 49:29.980
Did anyone else not understand?

49:33.971 --> 49:35.097
15-minute break.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.671
Beaulieu,
ask someone who was listening.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.419
Imagine that a grenade

50:04.101 --> 50:05.796
lands here in the middle of us.

50:06.837 --> 50:07.690
We're all dead.

50:08.105 --> 50:11.700
But to prevent that from happening,
it only takes one person.

50:11.909 --> 50:15.333
If he covers the grenade with his body,
he absorbs the blast.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.140
The others are saved

50:17.348 --> 50:18.963
and can fight back.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.701
Demonstration.

50:26.090 --> 50:28.240
Good show. We're all dead.

50:29.326 --> 50:30.759
Well done. Bravo.

50:30.961 --> 50:32.622
You're sure it's a fake?

50:32.830 --> 50:33.922
Yes.

50:40.638 --> 50:41.593
Good show, Peretti!

50:41.805 --> 50:44.774
We talked about team spirit.
That can mean sacrifice.

50:44.975 --> 50:46.556
Another problem, Beaulieu?

50:48.646 --> 50:49.476
Yes.

50:49.680 --> 50:53.696
In real lite no one would ever do that.
It's against our basic instincts.

50:53.951 --> 50:57.603
We're not here to let instincts rule.
Here we learn about duty.

50:59.223 --> 51:00.679
It's unenforceable, sir.

51:01.458 --> 51:02.470
End of discussion.

51:02.693 --> 51:05.207
Now for first aid. Who has training?

51:07.197 --> 51:07.879
Good.

51:08.065 --> 51:11.580
The others will do the course
while Labrede cleans the latrines.

51:42.066 --> 51:44.694
That first-aid class was intense.

51:45.736 --> 51:48.216
Beaulieu broke three
of the mannequin's ribs.

51:49.673 --> 51:50.594
You on a diet?

51:54.612 --> 51:56.307
Rustic simplicity my ass!

51:56.580 --> 51:58.104
Is this the paratroopers?

51:58.349 --> 51:59.600
Can you believe it?

52:00.884 --> 52:02.545
You don't want your Jello?

52:05.055 --> 52:06.010
Here.

52:07.057 --> 52:10.140
If you want,
I can show you how to do the massage.

52:11.028 --> 52:13.053
You know,
the first-aid cardiac massage.

52:13.263 --> 52:16.130
You want to show me
how to fold my panties too?

52:21.238 --> 52:22.603
She's hardcore.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.241
What's on the schedule tomorrow?

52:25.442 --> 52:27.103
Swimming with schlieter.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.092
Beaulieu.

52:33.283 --> 52:34.648
Listen to me carefully.

52:35.552 --> 52:37.372
Because I won't repeat it.

52:38.489 --> 52:39.979
I'm the one grading you.

52:40.157 --> 52:43.638
You impress no one
with your big mouth and your degrees.

52:43.894 --> 52:46.863
If you want to be a commando,
you'd better shape up.

52:47.631 --> 52:48.757
Is that clear?

52:49.667 --> 52:50.850
Yes, sir.

53:06.817 --> 53:08.182
Good show, men.

53:10.954 --> 53:11.636
Good.

53:12.823 --> 53:14.074
Nice reflex.

53:14.291 --> 53:15.724
I wouldn't have done it.

53:55.365 --> 53:56.525
Come on, push hard.

54:02.740 --> 54:03.695
Comeon.

54:08.178 --> 54:09.998
Don't push off the wall-.

54:12.082 --> 54:12.844
No, I'm good.

54:14.151 --> 54:14.765
Move aside!

54:14.985 --> 54:17.101
That's good.
The strong help the weak.

54:22.826 --> 54:23.952
Your turn, Labréde.

54:26.096 --> 54:27.108
That was good.

54:27.998 --> 54:28.828
Good, Labréde.

54:31.668 --> 54:32.589
Come on, Beaulieu.

54:32.836 --> 54:34.690
Yes! Come on, Beaulieu!

54:34.905 --> 54:35.587
That's ii!

54:35.939 --> 54:37.759
Push! You're almost there!

54:58.695 --> 55:00.720
Man down! Get him out!

55:43.307 --> 55:45.673
Reds! Man down!

55:47.110 --> 55:48.873
What are you talking about?

55:49.279 --> 55:50.234
What's going on?

55:50.414 --> 55:51.597
Nothing. I wasn't hit.

55:52.249 --> 55:53.227
Look at your bag.

55:53.417 --> 55:54.577
What about it?

55:56.153 --> 55:57.074
My bag was hit?

55:57.287 --> 55:59.653
If you're hit, you're eliminated.

55:59.923 --> 56:01.174
Hang on.

56:01.325 --> 56:02.815
What's inside my bag?

56:03.026 --> 56:05.290
My vital organs? My arteries?

56:06.763 --> 56:09.357
Bags?
No one said nothing about our bags.

56:09.833 --> 56:11.414
We're not going to argue.

56:11.635 --> 56:13.785
You're dead.
So you should shut up.

56:14.004 --> 56:17.201
Stop showing off.
Bullets pierce a bag, so lie down!

56:17.374 --> 56:20.798
What's the deal?
You think you're a ballistics expert?

56:21.311 --> 56:24.098
- Stop the bullshit. You were hit.
- I was not!

56:24.314 --> 56:26.282
Then take it off-
show us your back-.

56:26.483 --> 56:28.599
Dream on. Suck off your pal.

56:29.319 --> 56:32.402
I think we should all
return to our initial positions.

56:32.623 --> 56:34.284
Are you her pet dog or what?

56:34.458 --> 56:36.642
I feel sorry for you. Go lie down.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.327
And you, Beaulieu, stop...

56:59.349 --> 57:00.509
How are you?

57:01.251 --> 57:02.434
What happened?

57:04.421 --> 57:05.877
I got a warning.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.243
It'll stay on my record.

57:08.525 --> 57:09.958
Shit.

57:10.160 --> 57:12.128
All because of that prick.

57:12.329 --> 57:13.990
Go on, hold your nose.

57:14.197 --> 57:17.394
The mountain infantry taught him to piss
and he thinks he's hot.

57:17.601 --> 57:20.297
But a little headbutt
sends him running-.

57:20.704 --> 57:23.639
I hate guys like that!
Why is he here, to kiss ass?

57:23.840 --> 57:25.273
Chill, Madeleine.

57:33.383 --> 57:35.533
Want to try the makeup workshop?

57:44.294 --> 57:45.420
Okay.

58:01.378 --> 58:02.663
The idea is to...

58:03.213 --> 58:04.999
break up the shape of the face.

58:08.585 --> 58:10.348
You apply it with two fingers...

58:12.756 --> 58:14.576
in diagonal streaks.

58:21.398 --> 58:22.683
You want to conceal...

58:26.269 --> 58:27.520
the patterns of your nose...

58:31.975 --> 58:33.340
your mouth...

58:41.985 --> 58:43.418
and your eyes.

58:50.494 --> 58:52.314
That way, everything disappears.

59:02.506 --> 59:05.259
- It burns.
- That's normal. Don't touch.

59:06.476 --> 59:07.636
Look.

59:14.017 --> 59:15.177
Very good.

59:18.188 --> 59:19.348
Now it's my turn.

59:30.367 --> 59:31.493
What's that?

59:33.503 --> 59:34.595
Nothing.

59:35.505 --> 59:38.474
They made me unit leader
for the orienteering race.

59:44.314 --> 59:45.235
Close your eyes.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:12.854
Everyone smile!

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.543
The first unit to attain the objective

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:22.051
will have the honor of raising
the regiment's flag on saturday.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.441
Is that clear?

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.119
Yes, sir.

01:00:30.527 --> 01:00:31.812
Good luck, Labréde.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:34.442
Get the upper hand.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.404
Leduc, are we good?

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.964
Yeah, it's over there.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.911
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:10.192
Charlie, Romeo speaking.
State your coordinates.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.965
Lieutenant schliefer?

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.934
I can't hear you, Lieutenant.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:18.393
There is no Lieutenant schlieter!
This is Romeo. Over.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.434
Madeleine, stop it.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.639
Charlie, Romeo speaking.
State your coordinates.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.098
Where are we, Jordan?

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.276
We're either here... or here.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.014
But I'd say we're heading...

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:33.438
that way.

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:36.518
That's east. The target is due south.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:40.289
Jordan's having a hard time.
I think we're totally lost.

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:41.327
Sum up, Samara.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.691
"Lost" is not a coordinate.

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.117
The target isn't really south.

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:47.951
Yes, it is. Look, Jordan.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.139
The hill slopes downwards.

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:51.963
That changes the direction.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:53.725
Are you sure?

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.429
Give it here.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.231
- Give the map back!
- One minute.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:03.004
No, give it back right now!

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.571
Let me deal with it.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.047
Listen to me.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:33.360
What?

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.834
Doesn't he have the compass?

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.467
I'm sorry! Okay?

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:41.102
You have the compass by the way!

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:29.848
Where are you going?

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:31.827
I have a life to go back to.

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:53.948
Good evening.

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.788
Would you like anything?

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.352
A beer, please.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.494
We only have alcohol-free.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.745
Maybe with the regional specialties?

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.714
An alcohol-free beer is fine.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.072
Everything alright?

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:14.635
It's nothing.

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:17.335
Vigipirate security plan.

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:20.643
Would you like anything?

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:22.678
No.

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:45.685
You insinuating I don't have a life?

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:48.810
I'm not insinuating, I'm saying it:
You have no life.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:52.006
You don't like people.
You eat things that disgust you.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:55.150
When you do sports,
you look like you want to die.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.514
You fight to stay in the army
but you hate it.

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:02.543
I'm sorry, life is the opposite
of everything you do.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.124
And building dumb wood huts is life?

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.625
It might be dumb but I like doing it.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.913
- You don't like anything.
- It's not true.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.326
- It's not true?
- No.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:13.092
Tell me one thing you like.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.066
I like lots of things.

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:16.530
For example...

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:27.571
For example, I like dogs.

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:28.967
Dogs?

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.153
Like that one?

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.653
Exactly.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.930
Hey, doggie.

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:46.592
Don't waste your breath.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.524
Hey, puppy 1109!

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.136
Come here, puppy.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.597
You got some extra room?

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.872
If you want to go back
with your loser friends, it's time.

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.066
Come on, let's go.

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.624
What now?

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:10.073
We'll survive. We'll adapt.
That's what you wanted, right?

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.870
What do you have on you?

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.045
I have a knife. That's all.

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:19.643
I have a flashlight, mess kits
and the camouflage tarpaulin.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.321
We're totally underequipped. Great.

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:24.674
Wait, I have one combat ration left.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:26.220
Lamb stew.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:28.613
Toss it. We don't need their stuff.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.112
Lamb stew...

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:35.255
They'll be no help
when everything goes up in flames.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.055
This is a perfect spot.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.833
There's everything we need.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.170
It's great.

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.121
What are you doing?

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.483
What're you doing?

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.386
I'm going to build a shelter.

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:33.325
What's so funny?

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:34.922
Nothing.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:36.524
It's cool.

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.715
It's not finished yet.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.361
I'll put some storage space here.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:09.221
There's a bookshelf in the back.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.187
Great.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.378
Not bad, huh?

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:20.064
I'll get some moss to insulate the roof.

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:24.145
Don't go that way. I laid traps.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.708
Not that way either.

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:32.835
No?

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.256
You should probably go around.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:39.258
This way?

01:11:58.581 --> 01:11:59.946
What next?

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.407
Nothing. We just enjoy.

01:12:08.224 --> 01:12:10.556
Can't we enjoy and do something?

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.652
We shouldn't expend calories.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.624
Why don't you make a fishing line?

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.905
Do I have to wait long?

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.274
You have to wait.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.134
What's the goal?

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:15.476
The goal is to bury them gently

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:17.083
without breaking them.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.922
What's the point?

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.474
Nothing.

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:28.996
You want to try?

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.461
What do you think about
while you do it?

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:46.593
Nothing.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.584
I can't do it.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:09.185
Then you won't survive.

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:15.573
It you cant concentrate
on a pine needle, you can't survive.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.968
Knowing how to pass the time...

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:27.274
not doing or thinking about anything
in particular... that's surviving.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.480
Otherwise you go crazy.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.284
What's going on?

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:10.980
I'm passing the time.

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:15.244
Hang on,
I'll wrap the wire around once more.

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.973
You think it'll hold?

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:18.684
Of course it will.

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:20.749
It's a real pro's trap.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:27.093
Turn it the other way.

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.907
Wow, looks like France.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.779
I'm hungry.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:53.706
You're always hungry.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:55.755
Did you hear something?

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.789
No, it was my stomach.

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.690
The wildlife here
is starting to piss me off-.

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:10.335
We still have those weird hazelnuts.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.261
They have zero protein.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:27.014
We should've taken more snickers
from the army.

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:03.221
Come on, eat! Don't be fussy.

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:05.958
It's disgusting.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.055
Shit, look at this.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.189
I'm sure you can eat the bones.

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.772
I bet it's full of good stuff.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:25.777
I can't eat this.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.830
Don't waste food!

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.166
I swear to God, this is horrible.

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:32.365
I'm done.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.555
I'll stick to fishy hazelnuts.

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:37.474
You don't know what you're missing.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:44.651
I think I'm lying on a rock.

01:21:46.802 --> 01:21:49.066
Are we sleeping directly on the ground?

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:51.203
No, not at all.

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:54.230
I made a one-inch mattress of lichen.

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:57.945
It's okay.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:21:59.330
It's fine.

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:01.243
Want me to remove the rock?

01:22:01.517 --> 01:22:02.802
No, don't worry.

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:05.801
I'll curl up around it.

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.445
By the way...

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:16.658
why are you whispering?

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:20.590
I don't want to scare off the game-.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.455
Oh, I see.

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:53.860
Are you okay?

01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:55.196
Don't look.

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:03.458
I'll stay over here, okay?

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.993
You're shaking. I'll get a jacket.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:54.689
Madeleine!

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.324
Are you okay?

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.215
Open your eyes. Keep your eyes open!

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:37.403
Look at me!

01:26:37.993 --> 01:26:39.085
Look at me!

01:29:26.127 --> 01:29:29.927
She's upstairs.
She hasn't woken up yet, but she's fine.

01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:37.363
Thanks.

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.422
They can't get the fire under control.

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:43.225
900 hectares have already burnt.

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:46.459
The town they found you in
burned down.

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.137
Wiped off the map-.

01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:52.052
We were lucky.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.312
How much is 900 hectares?

01:29:58.660 --> 01:29:59.752
200,000 trees?

01:29:59.995 --> 01:30:02.259
More like 2 million. You hall asleep?

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.396
It's a big deal.
It'll affect the price of wood.

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:10.149
We're okay,
I stocked up before. You'll see.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.839
If you want to, that is.

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:15.304
I'm not forcing you.

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:23.612
Can you imagine the waste?
All because some idiot tossed a cigarette.

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:26.881
People don't realize
how fragile forests are.

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:31.918
Sometimes forest fires occur naturally.

01:30:32.694 --> 01:30:34.958
The forest just bursts into flames.

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:38.124
- Where did you hear that?
- On TV.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:44.269
When the forest reaches
its maximum development...

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:47.374
when there's really no more room,
a fire breaks out.

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:48.701
Everything burns.

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:52.474
Afterwards, the forest starts afresh.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:55.314
Everything starts over.

01:31:01.523 --> 01:31:04.117
But most of the time...

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:07.914
it's some idiot who tosses a cigarette.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.489
The other case is rare.

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:19.992
How's the tomato soup?

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.402
Wonderful.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.268
You don't hurt anywhere?

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:22.522
Not at all.

01:32:23.772 --> 01:32:25.797
Barely 3 on a scale of one to ten.

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.427
Did you have to rate your pain?

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:30.174
What did you say?

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.528
Four for the head. I had a headache.

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:37.696
Here?

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.136
It's funny...

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:47.157
I'd never have thought of rating pain.

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:48.855
Higher UP-

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:53.523
Three's not bad.
It leaves room for improvement.

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:56.831
We can call it a day.

01:32:57.839 --> 01:32:59.454
We'll recover slowly.

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.255
I'm already feeling better.

01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:02.397
Oh yeah?

01:33:02.544 --> 01:33:04.660
Of course, I was better trained.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.176
Nice to hear,
next time you'll carry me.

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.502
Next time...

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.035
it's going to be different.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.881
Next time,
we need to be better prepared.

01:33:19.861 --> 01:33:20.714
We will be.

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:22.712
We'll be ready.

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:24.176
That's right.

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:28.130
