00:01.080 --> 00:02.923
Previously on Grimm...

00:03.440 --> 00:05.329
They said you were dead.
I think I was.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.776
I hope that stick does
what we think it does.

00:06.800 --> 00:07.801
It's healing her!

00:07.880 --> 00:08.880
I'm being haunted.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.524
I believe they're
going to kill you.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.931
Two men waiting by your car.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.847
This time, you chose
the right side, Sean.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.127
Two dimensions
exist simultaneously,

00:18.200 --> 00:20.680
one where the cat is alive,
one where it's dead.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.003
As long as the box stays
closed, both realities exist-

00:27.600 --> 00:28.965
- Eve! Nick!
- Diana.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.965
Mommy, it worked.
I got Nick back for you.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.247
I think part of you
stayed in the other place.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.129
She's not a Hexenbiest anymore.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.241
No!

00:46.800 --> 00:47.801
No!

00:50.120 --> 00:51.360
No!

01:24.360 --> 01:26.124
Wu, come on.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.282
Wu, wake up, now, Wu.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.209
This'll bring you back.
All right?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.404
It worked on me.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.089
Come on!

01:44.160 --> 01:47.209
Wu, come on! Come on, Wu.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.046
Come on. Come on, man.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.731
Hank! Come on!
Come on! This has to work.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.531
Come on, Hank, you're not gonna die.
You can't die!

02:09.639 --> 02:11.563
Please, please, Hank, come on.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.126
Why isn't this working?

02:18.240 --> 02:19.241
God!

02:20.040 --> 02:21.041
Oh, God.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.605
Nick!

02:22.680 --> 02:24.125
Nick!

02:28.400 --> 02:30.004
They're dead.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.730
Oh, my God.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.811
Oh, my God, Nick.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.928
Did you... It's not working.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.089
No, they can't be dead!

02:40.480 --> 02:42.323
Oh, my God! He killed everybody.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.925
Except me, and I don't know why.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.570
Maybe he thought you were dead,

02:45.640 --> 02:47.165
or maybe
the stick protected you.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.376
Well, if the stick protected me,

02:48.400 --> 02:50.160
why didn't it do anything
to help Hank or Wu?

02:52.600 --> 02:53.736
Didn't anybody shoot this thing?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.728
We all did, it didn't
make any difference.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.526
Nick, we have to find
out how to stop him.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.450
I'm not gonna have
any more cops killed.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.689
I'm gonna find him
and I'm gonna kill him.

03:05.760 --> 03:10.687
If bullets won't kill him, we have to
do this the way our ancestors did.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.000
Cut off his head.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.560
The weapon's still
in the Spice Shop?

03:13.880 --> 03:15.450
I have to warn Adalind first.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.966
It's Nick.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.325
- Nick?
- Where's Renard?

03:29.400 --> 03:30.481
He's right here.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.336
He needs to hear this,
but I don't want Diana to.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.408
She's asleep. We're upstairs.
What happened?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.925
Zerstörer hit the precinct.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.126
What?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.804
He killed
everyone who was inside.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.481
Everyone?

03:41.640 --> 03:43.005
Including Hank and Wu.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.086
Oh, my God, Nick, no.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.606
Where were you?

03:48.680 --> 03:50.011
I was with them.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.240
I was the only one he didn't kill...
Couldn't kill... I don't know.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.124
Bullets don't have
any effect on him.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.409
I still have the stick, maybe
that's why I'm not dead.

03:59.480 --> 04:05.328
I tried to use it on Wu and Hank,
but it didn't do anything.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.200
Nick, Diana said that this
thing doesn't just want her,

04:11.280 --> 04:13.044
it also wants Kelly.

04:14.840 --> 04:15.887
No.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.603
We have to stop him.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.081
We're doing everything we can.
Trubel's with me.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.207
Thank God.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.640
I'm gonna send her after you.
What?

04:24.680 --> 04:26.967
If he finds them,
I need one of us with them.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.407
Okay-

04:28.480 --> 04:30.776
I'm going to the Spice Shop, I'll
check in with you from there.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.211
Please be careful.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.725
You, too.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.765
Here, take my car.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.200
I don't think we
should split up.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.049
I need you out there.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.922
What if...

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
What if, what?

04:48.400 --> 04:53.281
I'm afraid to even say it, but what
if Zerstörer really is unstoppable?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.486
You mean unkillable?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.096
I mean un-whatever it
takes to get rid of him.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.124
We don't know if he's a devil,
some dark force of the universe,

04:59.200 --> 05:00.850
or just evil incarnate.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.536
Everything has
a beginning and an end.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.200
Well, I'm not finding
any beginning or end

05:04.240 --> 05:05.765
to whatever Zerstörer is.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.730
"Strength of One's Blood"
mean anything to anybody?

05:08.840 --> 05:09.966
No, why?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.809
Well, there's
a reference to it here,

05:11.880 --> 05:13.616
maybe sort of an Achilles'
heel type of thing?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.165
Specifically for Zerstörer?

05:15.360 --> 05:19.046
No, it's more generically in
reference to unstoppable evil,

05:19.120 --> 05:22.329
Zerstörer-like dark
forces of the universe

05:22.400 --> 05:24.926
that precipitate
apocalyptic events.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.526
"When the beast
appears invincible

05:30.640 --> 05:32.927
"and death the only
fate to those who fight it,"

05:33.080 --> 05:35.481
"only the strength
of one's blood"

05:35.560 --> 05:40.487
"can overcome the great evil
and destroy the destroyer."

05:40.760 --> 05:42.330
"Strength of One's Blood."

05:42.400 --> 05:44.562
There are a ton of
blood spells in this book.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.005
It's how I got
through the mirror.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.605
I think I know of one.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.445
It's a potion. Force do sang.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.682
It's in one of
my parents' books.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.048
It's really difficult to make
though, it takes a ton of time,

05:56.120 --> 05:57.531
has quite a few ingredients,

05:57.600 --> 05:59.364
and is almost impossible to do

05:59.440 --> 06:02.364
because it requires the blood
of three opposing forces,

06:02.440 --> 06:05.011
a Grimm, a Wesen,
and a Hexenbiest.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.320
Well, yeah.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.696
I mean, that would
be next to impossible,

06:07.720 --> 06:10.016
considering a Grimm will kill any
Wesen who asks for its blood,

06:10.040 --> 06:13.931
and a Hexenbiest will pretty much
kill anything for any reason.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.570
But not for us.

06:16.760 --> 06:17.886
You really think it'll work?

06:17.960 --> 06:22.409
I have no idea, but it's definitely
a "last resort" kind of potion.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.847
Maybe it's just what we need
to defeat this evil bastard.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.360
Well, we're gonna
have to ask Adalind

06:26.400 --> 06:27.800
because my blood
won't work anymore.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.005
I'll text Nick.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.081
Dude, we are taking you down.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.210
That's enough.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.200
Okay, now.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.401
Nick, back here.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.816
We may be onto something
that might put an end to Zerstörer.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.649
Yeah, it's sort of
an Achilles' heel deal.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.881
It's called force do sang.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.016
It's referenced in one of the books
as "Strength of One's Blood."

07:12.040 --> 07:13.326
We're gonna need your blood.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.241
What's wrong?

07:23.400 --> 07:25.880
It hit the precinct.

07:29.160 --> 07:33.529
We tried to fight it,
but it killed everyone.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.929
What do you mean, everyone?

07:38.680 --> 07:41.126
Hank. Wu.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.602
What? Oh, my God!

07:47.040 --> 07:48.883
Hank and Wu are gone?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.481
Yeah.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.884
I can't believe it.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.724
Trubel showed up after.
I sent her to the cabin.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.124
What do you need my blood for?

08:09.240 --> 08:10.810
We need the blood
of a Grimm, a Wesen,

08:10.880 --> 08:12.325
and a Hexenbiest
for this to work.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.056
They all need to be
mixed at the same time.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.206
We have to go to Adalind.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.203
Nick, it's the strongest
poison I know of.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.328
Yeah, supposedly,
just this side of nuclear.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.084
Let's do it! All right.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.056
I just need a few more minutes
to get it ready to go.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.162
This better work,

08:25.240 --> 08:26.680
'cause I don't
know how I'm gonna get

08:26.720 --> 08:28.280
close enough to him
to cut his head off.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.448
Hey, get me a thermos.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.411
I wonder who was
collecting all of these.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.926
If I remember, it was a postman.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.009
Blutbaden, old school.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.089
Look, I want to
tell you something.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.489
Now, we've both
made a lot of mistakes.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.880
Too many.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.567
But we did one thing right.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.041
Diana.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.651
I'm sorry for
a lot of that stuff.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.844
Me, too.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.651
I wish I'd never heard of those
damn keys, or Black Claw.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.240
Or Bonaparte. Or this.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.244
Am I ever gonna be able
to take this damn thing off?

09:28.320 --> 09:29.924
You never tried
after Bonaparte died?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.048
He said that
great harm would come

09:32.120 --> 09:33.610
to my children if
I ever took it off.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.330
I don't want to
take that chance.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.927
I will do everything in my power
to protect Diana and Kelly.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.170
I know you will.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.361
It's Trubel.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.681
Trubel!

10:12.120 --> 10:13.600
You're supposed to
be on our side now?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.605
A lot has changed.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.051
Yeah, I know.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.649
I wish Meisner knew.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.210
Trust me, he does.

10:34.040 --> 10:37.408
I'll be outside.
If he shows, you'll know.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.765
Question, once it's ready,
how do we get it on Zerstörer?

10:47.320 --> 10:48.536
What about
dipping bullets in it?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.696
Like we did with the Siegbarste?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.696
Remember, we shot him with
that poison and it worked.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.767
I still have the gun.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.360
Maybe we should bring it.
I'll get it.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.526
Take your own car.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.216
Once this is ready,
you don't need to be there.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.287
I'll ride with Nick.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.681
I wish I hadn't lost what I was.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.170
I'm sorry my blood is no good for
this, we could've made it here.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.640
I thought you weren't gonna
do that anymore.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.486
Do what?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.564
Regret what's done.

11:33.640 --> 11:38.123
I have no regrets, and I
am definitely not done.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.765
That I know.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.963
Nick, go, they need your blood!

12:14.200 --> 12:15.565
No!

12:15.640 --> 12:16.687
Go!

12:26.760 --> 12:29.001
Eve.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.810
Juliette.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.171
No regrets.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.365
Come on. Come on.
Not you. Not you.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.047
Oh, God!

13:18.200 --> 13:19.770
Where are you?

13:21.880 --> 13:23.644
Come back and fight!

13:25.520 --> 13:27.443
God damn you!

13:28.560 --> 13:29.846
Come on!

14:08.600 --> 14:10.204
You alone? Yeah.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.816
But Nick and Eve should be
pretty close behind us.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.205
He tell you about Hank and Wu?

14:13.280 --> 14:17.046
I can't believe it.
I don't think I ever will.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.565
You brought food?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.520
We found something
that might work on Zerstörer.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.561
What?

14:21.640 --> 14:23.449
We need to talk to Adalind.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.601
She's inside.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.929
What happened?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.525
We found something
in one of the books

14:32.640 --> 14:34.290
referenced as
"Strength of One's Blood."

14:34.360 --> 14:35.736
Have you ever
heard of force do sang?

14:35.760 --> 14:36.921
"Power of blood"?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.446
Yeah, I have, but, I mean, that's
pretty impossible, isn't it?

14:39.520 --> 14:40.760
It's definitely not easy.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.456
We're praying it'll
work against Zerstörer.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.562
Okay, but doesn't
it need a Wesen,

14:44.640 --> 14:46.210
Hexenbiest, and a Grimm's blood?

14:46.320 --> 14:48.880
Yes, Nick should be here soon.
We'll just start getting it ready.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.121
Okay-

14:51.000 --> 14:52.161
Okay-

15:26.520 --> 15:27.521
That's his place.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.726
What's happening?

15:34.800 --> 15:37.280
I can't guarantee what'll
happen if I go any closer.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.091
It's too dangerous.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.851
But there's nothing more I can do.
I'm out of here.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.964
Hey. Where's Eve?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.086
No.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.080
Let's go.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.561
Nick's here.

16:10.640 --> 16:15.202
Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.
It's just awful about Hank and Wu.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.976
- They didn't deserve that.
- None of 'em did.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Where's Eve?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.811
Zerstörer hit the Spice Shop
just after you left.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.644
Oh, God. He killed her.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.131
Oh, God.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.165
This can't be happening.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.605
He let you live again?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.364
It's gotta be the stick.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.283
I don't know how
else to explain it.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.249
I tried to use it on her,
it didn't work.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.685
This Will.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.565
Okay, the knife has to go through
all of our hands together.

16:41.640 --> 16:42.687
Then what?

16:42.760 --> 16:43.807
Then we pull it out,

16:43.880 --> 16:46.531
and all of our blood flows
together into the bowl.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.405
It can't be one
of the three of us.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.601
I can't.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.291
I can.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.765
Now, we Woge.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.925
DO it!

17:15.119 --> 17:16.201
Keep it together!

17:16.280 --> 17:18.567
Keep it together!
Keep it together!

17:18.680 --> 17:19.965
Okay-

17:31.920 --> 17:33.445
That's enough blood.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.960
I like that part of the spell.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.050
I've never seen that before.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.691
Hope that's what
happens to Zerstörer.

18:05.800 --> 18:06.801
Mommy.

18:08.680 --> 18:09.816
Is everything all right, honey?

18:09.840 --> 18:12.889
I feel different
and I can't sleep.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.485
There's no need to
be scared, sweetie.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.005
I'm not anymore.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.243
Well, good.
Because we have something

18:19.320 --> 18:21.004
that'll take care of
him once and for all.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.329
Oh, so you know
he's coming here.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.201
What?

18:27.880 --> 18:29.609
He knows where Nick is.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.330
How?

18:32.200 --> 18:33.361
The stick tells him.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.407
Oh, my God! That's how he
knows where you are, Nick.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.563
And he wants it, Nick. He's been
looking for it for a very long time.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.890
Diana?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.201
Diana!

19:31.760 --> 19:33.205
No. No!

19:33.280 --> 19:34.805
No, Diana!

19:41.040 --> 19:42.371
Take Kelly and get out of here.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.204
Nick, you need me! Save him!

19:44.280 --> 19:45.566
Trubel, please!

19:46.760 --> 19:48.364
Okay, you should go with Trubel.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.807
I am not leaving you, and
don't you dare argue with me!

19:50.880 --> 19:53.884
Don't hurt him.
He wants me to be with him.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.096
Honey, you don't know
what you're talking about.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.690
He needs me!

20:07.960 --> 20:09.724
I'll die before I
let you have her.

20:09.800 --> 20:10.961
I know.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.371
Monroe, get the bowl.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.136
- But don't spill anything!
- Don't get it on you!

20:20.160 --> 20:21.161
Okay-

20:32.800 --> 20:34.165
Oh, my God.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.251
Diana.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.326
It's working!

21:09.360 --> 21:10.964
I'm not taking any chances.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.045
Oh, crap!

21:24.280 --> 21:27.921
Trubel! Run!

21:38.440 --> 21:39.521
Monroe!

22:13.760 --> 22:14.886
Adalind.

22:18.440 --> 22:22.525
Save Kelly and Diana.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.763
No. No.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.286
Monroe. Monroe.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.889
No, you can't.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.841
You can't.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.681
No!

24:28.360 --> 24:30.681
Stay away from my brother.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.366
Diana...

24:35.200 --> 24:36.645
You son of a bitch!

24:40.440 --> 24:41.601
Kelly!

25:08.800 --> 25:10.211
We're ready.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.491
My brother likes you, too.

25:21.480 --> 25:26.361
You've taken everything from me,
you're not gonna take my son.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.206
That doesn't need to happen.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.086
None of this does.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.881
The stick is what you want.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.001
It is.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.640
You can't kill me
as long as I have it.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.769
I'm willing to give you
something in exchange for it.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.049
I'm not interested.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.165
You will be.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.006
Trubel!

26:28.680 --> 26:30.444
Trubel...

26:30.520 --> 26:33.683
Nick! Did We kill him?

26:34.440 --> 26:35.601
No.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.246
Then why are we alive?

26:39.560 --> 26:41.847
I can give them all back to you.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.045
What the hell is going on?

27:15.160 --> 27:16.446
You can have it.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.170
No, Nick!

27:33.240 --> 27:35.607
You can't give it to this
lying son-of-a-bitch-devil!

27:36.640 --> 27:39.325
If he wants the stick so bad,
why doesn't he just take it?

27:39.840 --> 27:41.888
Why's he asking when he can
just take it from you?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.166
What is he not telling you?

27:48.320 --> 27:51.483
You might want to ask
your children what to do.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.920
Nick, you can't give it to him.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.091
I want the people I
love to live again.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.401
Take it!

28:06.480 --> 28:09.211
No, Nick! Nick, no!

28:09.280 --> 28:10.566
Don't! Nick!

28:10.640 --> 28:13.211
I understand what you want, but
this will be the end of humanity.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.363
This isn't about us,
or the ones we love.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.680
I can't let you do this.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.040
Get out of my way!

28:19.120 --> 28:20.360
No.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.489
Nick! Nick,
please don't do this.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.761
No!

29:40.160 --> 29:43.448
Nick! Nick.

29:43.520 --> 29:47.445
You must not...
You cannot betray us.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.249
And what we are.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.606
Stop. You must stop.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.091
KELLY; Nick. Nicky!

30:01.240 --> 30:02.446
Mom?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.409
You can't do
what you want to do.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.841
How are you here?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.241
Don't give away what you hold.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.884
They're all dead.
I have no choice!

30:17.000 --> 30:18.286
AUNT MARIE; Nick.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.561
Aunt Marie.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.723
What you think you have to do
is not what must be done.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.405
Trubel is right.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.528
He can't take it from you,
it has to be given to him.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.282
That is why he has taken
everyone you loved, Nick.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.011
So that you will
give him what he wants.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.326
If you do this,

30:39.440 --> 30:42.922
you will sacrifice the world
to endless pain and suffering.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.690
The world you saw
in the other place.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.569
I want my friends back.

30:47.560 --> 30:52.771
I want Adalind, and Diana...
I want my son!

30:52.840 --> 30:53.841
I want 'em all back.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.490
You can defeat him.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.851
I tried, I can't!

30:57.960 --> 30:59.121
You can. You can.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.571
With the Strength
of One's Blood!

31:00.640 --> 31:02.085
We tried that! You didn't.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.016
The strength of your blood, the blood
of your Grimm ancestors, all of us!

31:05.040 --> 31:06.201
It's inside you.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.329
It's what's makes us who we are.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.526
Trubel, too.

31:10.600 --> 31:15.128
The strength we need, that we all
need, comes from our family.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.489
It's where we've always found
the way and the will to fight.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.282
And with that,
we can defeat any evil.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.490
Together.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.841
Nick!

32:19.520 --> 32:21.170
This is what you
killed everyone to get.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.490
Give it to me.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.406
Come and get it.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.201
No.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.606
You wanted it?

33:26.440 --> 33:27.441
Here it is.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.204
How'd you know I needed you?

33:59.280 --> 34:00.645
We feel it.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.770
Why do you think
Theresa came back?

34:05.320 --> 34:06.765
She felt it, too.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.565
We are all descendants
of the first Grimm.

34:09.639 --> 34:12.449
That stick you found, the one
our Grimm ancestors buried,

34:12.520 --> 34:14.123
is part of a much greater power.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.810
Guard it well.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.326
You kept me from
doing something terrible.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.841
We helped you
find your strength.

34:26.639 --> 34:30.121
Take good care of my grandson.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.043
I like his name.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.922
I can't believe we did it.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.927
The two of us
taking this thing down.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.402
The two of us?
What are you talking about?

34:47.520 --> 34:49.329
Me and you, who else?

35:05.520 --> 35:07.602
But I did nothing for them.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.849
Nick! Where did they go?

35:58.360 --> 35:59.486
Who?

35:59.560 --> 36:02.166
The other Grimms
fighting with you.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.771
Oh, my God.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.968
I can bring them
all back to life.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.808
What are you talking about?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.848
If it worked for you,
it can work for them.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.450
Nick, something's happening.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.801
No way!

36:51.800 --> 36:53.723
Nick... No!

36:53.800 --> 36:55.165
Nick, no!

36:56.840 --> 36:58.444
Nick! Nick, no!

37:00.480 --> 37:02.005
Nick, no!

37:11.920 --> 37:13.649
- Eve!
- Nick?

37:14.440 --> 37:16.681
Nick? I don't believe it!

37:16.760 --> 37:17.886
Are you okay?

37:17.960 --> 37:21.851
Mommy, it worked.
I got Nick back for you.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.443
Thank God you're okay.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.684
You're alive.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.967
Yeah, so are you.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.808
Oh, my God. You're all alive.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.441
What happened?

37:42.160 --> 37:45.130
Eve! You're okay!

37:46.040 --> 37:47.041
You're okay.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.131
Yeah.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.406
You're all okay.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.446
Even you. Yeah.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.522
We're fine.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.807
It's you two
we're worried about.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.046
Oh, my God, we're too late.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.804
Rosalee!

38:06.880 --> 38:08.041
Nick!

38:08.120 --> 38:09.326
Hank, you're okay!

38:09.400 --> 38:11.448
Wait, you're okay?

38:11.520 --> 38:12.646
And you!

38:12.720 --> 38:14.210
Oh, God. Oh, God!

38:14.280 --> 38:16.567
Yeah. Why, wasn't I?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.325
- Trubel!
- Trubel!

38:22.400 --> 38:23.696
What're you doing here?
Oh, my God!

38:23.720 --> 38:24.976
I've been looking for
you guys everywhere.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.240
Trubel.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.486
I had a feeling something
bad was gonna happen.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.446
But I guess it didn't.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.281
What?

38:43.360 --> 38:45.249
You're a Hexenbiest again.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.481
Again?

38:50.320 --> 38:53.051
Nick, he didn't
come back through.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.844
No, he didn't.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.084
He's dead,
and I'm not afraid anymore.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.365
Neither am I.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.201
Kelly! Where's Kelly?

39:12.880 --> 39:13.927
Hey!

39:20.120 --> 39:22.964
I'm so glad you're all here.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.246
Nick, are you all right?

39:29.960 --> 39:31.610
What's wrong?

39:35.120 --> 39:37.361
I thought you were all...

39:37.440 --> 39:38.805
Nick?

39:40.680 --> 39:43.286
I'm just so thankful
you're all here.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.169
I know this ain't
gonna make a lot of sense,

39:52.240 --> 39:54.686
but when I was in
the other place,

39:54.760 --> 39:56.120
I didn't know if
I'd ever get back.

39:57.920 --> 40:02.448
And I felt what it would be
like to lose all of you,

40:02.520 --> 40:04.443
everyone I ever loved,

40:04.520 --> 40:06.921
and anyone who ever meant
anything to me, my family.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.571
We thought we had
lost you, too, man.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.567
Come here.

40:17.640 --> 40:18.641
We did it!

40:21.480 --> 40:23.244
Uh, Nick?

40:35.360 --> 40:37.249
Where did this come from?

40:42.960 --> 40:45.327
He didn't
know what to tell them.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.244
But this time Zerstörer did
not come through the mirror

40:48.320 --> 40:50.163
anywhere in the world.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.248
Because in the final epic battle

40:56.320 --> 40:58.209
with the terrible
beast from the other place,

40:58.280 --> 41:01.443
Nick Burkhardt discovered that
the only way to defeat such evil

41:01.560 --> 41:03.608
was with
the Strength of his Blood,

41:03.680 --> 41:05.808
his Aunt Marie,
his mother Kelly,

41:05.880 --> 41:09.043
and Trubel, his third cousin
on his mother's side.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.043
The power of our ancestors.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.136
And though the people
of our world would never know

41:13.160 --> 41:15.481
how close they had
come to Hell on Earth,

41:15.560 --> 41:16.846
we knew.

41:16.920 --> 41:20.641
Because he never turned away
from who he was, a Grimm,

41:20.720 --> 41:23.405
and for that reason
the world was changed.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.643
Some will say it's just
a myth, legend, or fairy tale,

41:28.720 --> 41:31.485
but I know it's true
because my father told me so.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.722
Kelly, come on. I'm almost done.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.841
Let's go.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.445
Diana! Hurry up.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.646
I'm coming!

41:40.200 --> 41:41.565
Mom and Dad are waiting.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.723
We've got Wesen to kill.
The triplets are coming, too.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.851
Yeah?

41:49.920 --> 41:51.843
What's taking you so long?
