WEBVTT

00:01.896 --> 00:06.586
 previously on
"Survivor," at the kama tribe,

00:06.620 --> 00:09.275
The returning players were on
The outs.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.137
Someone needs to win this game.

00:11.172 --> 00:14.068
I don't want the play with
Returners, because they've had

00:14.103 --> 00:15.275
Their chance.

00:15.310 --> 00:20.206
 at the manu tribe,
Reem and wendy were isolating.

00:20.241 --> 00:22.241
Themselves.

00:22.793 --> 00:25.113
Those might be the three we
Were wanting to vote out any

00:25.137 --> 00:27.689
Way.

00:27.724 --> 00:30.482
 at tribal council
Reem dug her own grave.

00:30.517 --> 00:32.619
My name got thrown out today.

00:32.655 --> 00:34.068
I'm pissed off.

00:34.103 --> 00:35.758
But that is part of this game.

00:35.793 --> 00:37.448
I'm not done.

00:37.482 --> 00:38.862
Whatever.

00:38.896 --> 00:41.034
 and was first person
Voted out.

00:41.068 --> 00:43.310
 reem, the tribe has
Spoken.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.103
Thanks.

00:46.137 --> 00:49.275
 and the first person
To face a new twist.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.448
What?

00:50.482 --> 00:54.517
 go home or grab the
Torch and go to the edge of.

00:54.551 --> 00:59.620
Extinction.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.758 --> 01:31.068
I have no idea where I am.

01:31.103 --> 01:33.724
And I still don't know what's
Going on.

01:33.758 --> 01:35.448
But they don't know I'm here.

01:35.482 --> 01:39.517
Like I hope to show my face
Again and be like, look what

01:39.551 --> 01:40.620
Just happened.

01:40.655 --> 01:43.068
You know, I would love that.

01:43.103 --> 01:50.103
But again, like what do I have
To go through for this second

01:50.137 --> 01:52.896
Chance?

01:52.931 --> 01:55.103
This is the edge of extinction.

01:55.137 --> 01:58.517
You will have to work hard for
Everything.

01:58.551 --> 02:03.482
When fear or loneliness sets in,
You must find the resolve to

02:03.517 --> 02:05.034
Overcome.

02:05.068 --> 02:09.862
If at any point you wish to end
Your adventure, raise the sail

02:09.895 --> 02:12.793
And a boat will pick you up.

02:12.827 --> 02:14.827
What?

02:14.862 --> 02:20.000
There's no time line on this?

02:20.034 --> 02:21.275
Edge of extinction.

02:21.310 --> 02:25.793
What does that mean?

02:25.827 --> 02:30.448
I'm stranded.

02:30.482 --> 02:36.758
Now I got nothing better to do
But analyze why I got voted off.

02:36.793 --> 02:38.068
I'm so disappointed.

02:38.103 --> 02:41.103
Like why didn't I notice I was
Seeming naggy.

02:41.137 --> 02:43.862
I just didn't want them to be
Hurt.

02:43.896 --> 02:46.793
Instead I blew my chance.

02:46.827 --> 02:52.517
I just don't want to embarrass
My kids.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.379
There has to be a good reason to
Leave them.

02:54.413 --> 02:57.068
I'm not a quitter though, man,
You know?

02:57.103 --> 02:58.172
I'm not a quitter.

02:58.206 --> 03:06.206
I'm not a quitter.

03:08.724 --> 03:12.310
I do not want to disappoint my
Family.

03:12.344 --> 03:20.344
That's what's keeping me from
Raising that damn sail.

03:22.379 --> 03:29.896
That's what's keeping me from
Raising that damn sail.

03:29.931 --> 03:31.724
This is funny.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.103
How are your hands?

03:33.137 --> 03:34.758
My god.

03:34.793 --> 03:37.862
Looking like an old lady.

03:37.896 --> 03:41.482
By my pedicure still looks
Great.

03:41.517 --> 03:44.586
How are you feeling about
Last night?

03:44.620 --> 03:46.493
Several people tried to get you
To come over, right?

03:46.517 --> 03:50.448
I understand reem was dead in
The water, but I didn't want to

03:50.482 --> 03:51.758
Side with kelley.

03:51.793 --> 03:53.655
Kelley has played two times
Before.

03:53.689 --> 03:54.827
We've seen her game play.

03:54.862 --> 03:56.448
We know how she plays.

03:56.482 --> 03:57.872
It's not her first rodeo, and if
You guys keep going with the

03:57.896 --> 04:00.551
Numbers, they will control the
Game.

04:00.586 --> 04:04.172
At tribal council, my strongest
Ally reem was voted out.

04:04.206 --> 04:07.206
Now I feel like I'm the next in
Line.

04:07.241 --> 04:07.965
I blame kelley.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.275
She's the ringleader.

04:09.310 --> 04:12.620
It makes me so angry.

04:12.655 --> 04:15.448
Kelley has played two times
Before this.

04:15.482 --> 04:17.654
For me, she's had her shot.

04:17.689 --> 04:20.137
Two times you can't do it, then
You can't do it.

04:20.172 --> 04:25.000
Don't try to mess up first-time
Players' games.

04:25.034 --> 04:28.103
She has this personality where
She tries to become your friend.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.000
A lot of people are eating that
Up.

04:30.034 --> 04:30.689
Not I.

04:30.724 --> 04:33.000
I can see right through that.

04:33.034 --> 04:33.724
Look over there.

04:33.758 --> 04:34.803
She's already working her magic.

04:34.827 --> 04:36.000
Right, right.

04:36.034 --> 04:38.620
I just feel like you guys
Have the power to get her out.

04:38.655 --> 04:42.275
Listen, I think your concerns
Are totally legitimate.

04:42.310 --> 04:43.448
Yeah.

04:43.482 --> 04:47.689
But to be honest, I don't
Think this part of the camp

04:47.724 --> 04:49.655
Right now is a good time for
This conversation.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.448
David, the other
Second-chance player, I think

04:52.482 --> 04:55.551
It's resonating in him, but
Right now he's playing more of a

04:55.586 --> 04:56.310
Go-with-the-flow kind of game.

04:56.344 --> 04:57.724
I understand that.

04:57.758 --> 05:00.896
But I think he's with me.

05:00.931 --> 05:05.310
So if rick and david are on
Board with it, then I just need

05:05.344 --> 05:08.620
One more vote.

05:08.655 --> 05:11.000
We have to watch now.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.586
100%.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.275
We have to be really, really,
Really careful.

05:15.310 --> 05:19.482
We have to keep close tabs on
Wendy now.

05:19.517 --> 05:20.655
She'll be idol hunting.

05:20.689 --> 05:25.379
I completely understand
Wendy's position, because I've

05:25.413 --> 05:26.000
Been there.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.413
I have been on the bottom.

05:27.448 --> 05:28.896
I have been the target.

05:28.931 --> 05:31.896
I know exactly how it feels.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.758
She's trying to get something
Going, and having someone in

05:34.793 --> 05:38.000
Camp who is freaking out and
Knows they're on the bottom is

05:38.034 --> 05:39.034
Very dangerous.

05:39.068 --> 05:44.068
I think she's trying to swap
And take us out.

05:44.103 --> 05:45.034
Liability.

05:45.068 --> 05:47.000
She's probably going to look
For an idol.

05:47.034 --> 05:49.758
How do you feel about going out
As a group?

05:49.793 --> 05:51.931
Doesn't matter who gets it.

05:51.965 --> 05:54.068
An open idol hunt?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.793
Yeah.

05:55.827 --> 05:58.103
We can't let wendy find the
Idol.

05:58.137 --> 06:01.689
I mean, everyone else worked
With me at the last tribal, and

06:01.724 --> 06:04.413
I'm getting the sense they want
To continue to work with me.

06:04.448 --> 06:07.827
But any time your name is thrown
Out there, it's like what, if

06:07.862 --> 06:11.586
Because sometimes these things
Catch fire some at this point

06:11.620 --> 06:14.482
It's wendy on this side and me
On this side, and we're

06:14.517 --> 06:17.103
Basically going to battle, and
One of us is going to win the

06:17.137 --> 06:25.034
War.

06:25.068 --> 06:27.034
We need a song and a dance.

06:27.068 --> 06:29.172
You have choreography?

06:29.206 --> 06:36.034
For the next immunity
Challenge... Come kama, kama,

06:36.068 --> 06:38.310
Kama.

06:38.344 --> 06:41.896
You bend over in front of me.

06:41.931 --> 06:45.655
Kama.

06:45.689 --> 06:48.482
Morale I think is a huge
Reason why we're doing well in

06:48.517 --> 06:50.758
This game right now, why we won
The other day.

06:50.793 --> 06:52.896
You have to be in a positive
Place.

06:52.931 --> 06:58.206
We need to feel bonded, and for
Us, dancing has become our

06:58.241 --> 07:02.827
Thing.

07:02.862 --> 07:05.275
K-a-m-a, kama, kama, kama.

07:05.310 --> 07:06.310
To the front.

07:06.344 --> 07:10.310
It's pump, pump, pump, and kama.

07:10.344 --> 07:16.689
I hate kum ba yah survivor,
But it's the worst.

07:16.724 --> 07:18.896
I want to blend in with everyone
Else.

07:18.931 --> 07:21.517
I like going to tribal first
When I play "Survivor," because

07:21.551 --> 07:23.044
You see immediately where the
Lines are.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.620
You know how to work with it.

07:24.655 --> 07:29.724
When it's consume "Kumbaya" and
Is, I just won first challenge,

07:29.758 --> 07:34.137
You don't know what the hell is
Going on.

07:34.172 --> 07:36.758
I haven't really talked to
Anyone.

07:36.793 --> 07:40.448
How are you guys feeling about
Returning in general?

07:40.482 --> 07:45.827
I'm glad that you guys are here.

07:45.862 --> 07:50.000
But like moving forward, is
That something that interests

07:50.034 --> 07:50.413
You?

07:50.448 --> 07:52.034
Yeah, yeah.

07:52.068 --> 07:56.103
Everyone's going to be scared of
Joe the further along we get,

07:56.137 --> 07:59.413
But that time is nowhere near
Here, and things can change

07:59.448 --> 07:59.827
Before them.

07:59.862 --> 08:01.103
Cool.

08:01.137 --> 08:04.310
I'm finding it frustrating
That these newbies aren't being

08:04.344 --> 08:07.965
Forthcoming about their
Perception of returning players.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.896
I know joe and I are under
Magnifying glass.

08:10.931 --> 08:14.241
We're like these ants that
People are looking at real hard,

08:14.275 --> 08:17.655
And I'm afraid the sun is going
To come and zap us the hell off

08:17.689 --> 08:21.827
This camp.

08:21.862 --> 08:24.586
Aubry is clearly trying to
Make sure she's not first one

08:24.620 --> 08:27.551
Out from our tribe, because
Aubry approached me and julia

08:27.586 --> 08:30.379
And said, so how do you feel
Tact returning players, which is

08:30.413 --> 08:34.895
An on-the-spot question to ask,
Like what can I possibly say?

08:34.931 --> 08:35.941
Yeah, we want you guys gone.

08:35.965 --> 08:37.724
They've had their moment to
Shine.

08:37.758 --> 08:39.517
It's our time to have our
Chance.

08:39.551 --> 08:41.562
Aubry said something interesting
To me the other day.

08:41.586 --> 08:44.551
She grabbed my arm and she said,
I really like you.

08:44.586 --> 08:47.724
Let me tell you, she said the
Exact same thing to me.

08:47.758 --> 08:51.068
She said the exact same thing to
Her, the exact same thing to

08:51.103 --> 08:52.310
Gavin.

08:52.344 --> 08:54.689
I heard, I just want to have
An open dialogue, those key

08:54.724 --> 08:55.793
Words.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.000
I like the way you think, you
Remind me of myself.

08:58.034 --> 08:59.620
Aubry is going to everyone.

08:59.655 --> 09:01.379
I think she's a little panicked.

09:01.413 --> 09:02.793
I have you.

09:02.827 --> 09:06.896
We could start to have a
Dialogue.

09:06.931 --> 09:08.103
I think so.

09:08.137 --> 09:10.965
I just wanted to make sure
That we can have a dialogue,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.206
Because I feel great with you.

09:12.241 --> 09:13.241
Right.

09:13.275 --> 09:15.103
She's like, I really like you.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.379
I think you're a good player.

09:16.413 --> 09:17.965
You remind me of patriots.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.724
I think you're cool.

09:19.758 --> 09:22.310
Some of the things you remind
Me, that's funny.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.206
You just remind me of me a lot.

09:24.241 --> 09:26.068
I think you play like I do.

09:26.103 --> 09:27.482
We see similar things.

09:27.517 --> 09:28.448
Okay.

09:28.482 --> 09:29.586
Same wavelength.

09:29.620 --> 09:32.379
She's doing her best to pull
Somebody in with her.

09:32.413 --> 09:34.517
She's doing a great job at her.

09:34.551 --> 09:37.551
She might have to go.

09:47.275 --> 09:48.724
Did you check this?

09:48.758 --> 09:50.000
No.

09:50.034 --> 09:54.344
There were so many little
Crevices up here.

09:54.379 --> 09:56.206
Get a stick.

09:56.241 --> 10:00.551
It usually won't be like that
Far down.

10:00.586 --> 10:03.275
I almost feel like kelley the
We should all look for an idol

10:03.310 --> 10:06.034
Together could be cover.

10:06.068 --> 10:07.827
Because she already has it?

10:07.862 --> 10:08.793
Let's go over here.

10:08.827 --> 10:11.137
I really like kelley.

10:11.172 --> 10:14.827
I feel good working about her
With a big group, but I don't

10:14.862 --> 10:17.000
Have anything with her.

10:17.034 --> 10:20.931
We shouldn't say anything to
Wendy that we're concrete doing

10:20.965 --> 10:21.862
It.

10:21.896 --> 10:25.965
But it's possible that it is
Now, you know?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.010
Wendy feels like her back is
Against the wall because she

10:28.034 --> 10:30.034
Lost her only ally, which was
Reem.

10:30.068 --> 10:32.068
She's worried she could be next
To go.

10:32.103 --> 10:35.965
So wendy's pitch is that we
Should get rid of wentworth.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.034
The funny thing is I know that
Kelley wentworth is not going to

10:40.068 --> 10:41.931
Let me get too deep into this
Game.

10:41.965 --> 10:44.724
I know she wants to cut me soon.

10:44.758 --> 10:47.551
She's a really smart player, and
She's going to do everything she

10:47.586 --> 10:49.620
Can to eliminate threats.

10:49.655 --> 10:53.000
What are you guys doing?

10:53.034 --> 10:54.700
I just need to know if you guys
Are working with me or with

10:54.724 --> 10:55.931
Them?

10:55.965 --> 11:00.931
Listen, we agree that
Kelley's a huge threat.

11:00.965 --> 11:04.827
I'm just saying, like I'm a
Number you can use, and we have

11:04.862 --> 11:05.517
The same end game.

11:05.551 --> 11:08.000
What would our numbers be?

11:08.034 --> 11:12.586
You, you, me, keith and war dog.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.965
I was loyal to reem even if it
Affected my game.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.413
This is what you want in this
Game, this is not on deaf ears.

11:18.448 --> 11:21.103
Orchestrating a blind side is
Very delicate.

11:21.137 --> 11:25.448
You have to be so careful about
Who you let know about it.

11:25.482 --> 11:28.896
I mean, keith seems to be tight
With wendy, but trying the pull

11:28.931 --> 11:31.862
In war dog, that makes me very
Nervous, because he doesn't like

11:31.896 --> 11:35.034
To talk tract until it's
Absolutely necessary.

11:35.068 --> 11:38.517
But at the same time, wendy's
Loyalty and trust could be worth

11:38.551 --> 11:39.931
More than money in this game.

11:39.965 --> 11:44.034
She wouldn't be a bad person no.

11:44.068 --> 11:45.137
She's so loyal.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.241
I think that's a great thing to
Have in our pocket.

11:47.275 --> 11:49.206
I don't want to shut this down
At all.

11:49.241 --> 11:52.310
But seriously, dude, I trusted
You in this game more than I

11:52.344 --> 11:52.862
Trust anybody else.

11:52.896 --> 11:53.931
I'm with you.

11:53.965 --> 11:56.379
Like I talk more game with you
Than anybody by far.

11:56.413 --> 11:57.068
Okay.

11:57.103 --> 11:58.000
Cool.

11:58.034 --> 11:59.689
I feel much more comfortable
With you.

11:59.724 --> 12:00.137
Yeah.

12:00.172 --> 12:01.103
I'm in.

12:01.137 --> 12:01.655
Okay.

12:01.689 --> 12:03.137
Good, man, great.

12:03.172 --> 12:04.413
Love it.

12:04.448 --> 12:07.965
My strategy coming into this
Game is get with big guys and

12:08.000 --> 12:11.655
Kind of slip through, and I
Think david might be my guy.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.068
We're two peas in a pod.

12:13.103 --> 12:14.724
I think we see the world the
Same way.

12:14.758 --> 12:16.379
We see the game the same way.

12:16.413 --> 12:19.310
I'm going to use my sense of
Humor and try to get in tight

12:19.344 --> 12:20.931
With him.

12:20.965 --> 12:23.827
I would be fine going all the
Way to the end with you.

12:23.862 --> 12:27.586
I shouldn't even be telling you,
This but you could like string

12:27.620 --> 12:30.413
Me along and cut my throat at
Four or five, whatever.

12:30.448 --> 12:33.724
I'm just telling you...
Let's shake on that I'll cut

12:33.758 --> 12:35.172
Your throat at four.

12:35.206 --> 12:37.068
Is that cool?

12:37.103 --> 12:38.655
Rick's hysterical.

12:38.689 --> 12:39.379
I love the guy.

12:39.413 --> 12:40.689
He's so much fun to be around.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.517
Rick is honestly the person I
Trust most in this game.

12:43.551 --> 12:46.241
Also he's very smart and
Strategic, and that could be

12:46.275 --> 12:47.551
Really great for my game.

12:47.586 --> 12:55.586
So I'm going to try to keep rick
Around for as long as possible.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.379
There is an idol here.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.724
Without a doubt.

13:01.758 --> 13:05.275
I think we can be more
Aggressive looking for the idol.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.482
We need the find it.

13:07.517 --> 13:12.103
Advantages and idols are in
Everyone's mind.

13:12.137 --> 13:13.655
I'm the the biggest fan here.

13:13.689 --> 13:17.068
I've been wanting to do this for
So dang long.

13:17.103 --> 13:20.517
As a fan watching through the
Tv, I'm thinking how in the heck

13:20.551 --> 13:21.831
Do these people find this stuff.

13:21.862 --> 13:24.137
And it's the same for me now.

13:24.172 --> 13:25.517
It's just shooting in the dark.

13:25.551 --> 13:32.379
You truly have no idea where
It's at.

13:32.413 --> 13:34.896
Geographically the space is
Huge.

13:34.931 --> 13:39.620
We have no idea how the idols
Are hidden or if there's clues

13:39.655 --> 13:41.448
Or markings.

13:41.482 --> 13:46.310
And the jungle is so thick that
You really have to search for an

13:46.344 --> 13:47.931
Extended period of time.

13:47.965 --> 13:55.965
And time away from the tribe is
Suspicious.

13:56.931 --> 13:58.827
Do you even think there are
Idols out here?

13:58.862 --> 14:00.620
Of course there are.

14:00.655 --> 14:04.689
Recently I see some men
Disappearing, and they're gone

14:04.724 --> 14:06.689
For a long time.

14:06.724 --> 14:09.862
Whether they're going off alone
Or they're going off in pairs,

14:09.896 --> 14:13.482
It's quite obvious there's a lot
Of idol searching going on.

14:13.517 --> 14:16.034
I'm sure they're looking for
Idols.

14:16.068 --> 14:17.251
Everybody should be looking for
Idols.

14:17.275 --> 14:19.689
Why aren't I looking for idols?

14:19.724 --> 14:21.931
Why do the men always find the
Idols?

14:21.965 --> 14:22.655
Okay.

14:22.689 --> 14:23.965
We need to be babysitting more.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.620
No, we need to be looking.

14:25.655 --> 14:27.458
I wish I knew what was going on
With idols and advantages.

14:27.482 --> 14:32.034
I'm sure people have started
Looking, but I have no idea how

14:32.068 --> 14:34.172
You would even begin to start
Looking for something.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.931
I mean, it's a big place, and
Everything is unique in its own

14:37.965 --> 14:39.517
Way, but also exactly the same.

14:39.551 --> 14:41.586
They're all trees that look a
Little funky.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.034
Where do you begin.

14:43.068 --> 14:45.310
This is what I was saying
With men versus women.

14:45.344 --> 14:47.000
We're sitting here chitchatting.

14:47.034 --> 14:48.724
We could be looking for an idol
Right now.

14:48.758 --> 14:54.275
It's interesting to me that
The women and men do fall into

14:54.310 --> 14:55.758
These preconceived roles.

14:55.793 --> 14:58.310
I don't know if it's about
Living this primitive lifestyle

14:58.344 --> 15:04.586
Where the men were the gatherers
And hunters... No, the women

15:04.620 --> 15:05.448
Were the gatherers.

15:05.482 --> 15:06.655
I don't know.

15:06.689 --> 15:09.103
I think it's my own personal
Issue that I have to start to

15:09.137 --> 15:09.724
Figure out.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.206
I'm not a sneaky person.

15:11.241 --> 15:15.103
And it feels sneaky to me to
Kind of slither off searching

15:15.137 --> 15:23.137
For idols.

15:29.241 --> 15:32.034
There's a lot of people
Looking for the idol.

15:32.068 --> 15:36.000
The odds of you finding it are
Slim, but ever since I was a

15:36.034 --> 15:40.068
Kid, finding an idol was kind of
On my "Survivor" bucket list,

15:40.103 --> 15:43.620
Because my two favorite female
Players were parvity and kelley

15:43.655 --> 15:49.655
Wentworth.

15:49.689 --> 15:52.241
They weren't just girls that
Rode coattails.

15:52.275 --> 15:54.965
They were bad asses, especially
Kelley wentworth.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
Kelley found two immunity idols
In her season.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.758
An she used them brilliantly.

16:01.793 --> 16:04.620
All right, baby.

16:04.655 --> 16:08.310
And so I always wanted to
Find an idol.

16:08.344 --> 16:09.275
And this is "Survivor."

16:09.310 --> 16:13.206
You can find an idol anywhere.

16:13.241 --> 16:18.172
I see a tree that's kind of
Fallen over.

16:18.206 --> 16:21.551
And I'm thinking, if I was an
Immunity idol, I would be hiding

16:21.586 --> 16:25.827
In there.

16:25.862 --> 16:33.862
I can't believe I pull out my
Beautiful immunity idol package.

16:34.068 --> 16:36.586
"You have found a hidden
Immunity idol."

16:36.620 --> 16:40.172
I feel ecstatic.

16:40.206 --> 16:42.551
My god, I found an immunity
Idol.

16:42.586 --> 16:48.655
Finding it on the same tribe as
One of my role models makes it

16:48.689 --> 16:50.344
Astronomically more exciting.

16:50.379 --> 16:54.206
I just have to hide it, because
I am 100% keeping it to myself.

16:54.241 --> 16:58.241
I'm very tight with kelley, but
I'm definitely not telling her.

16:58.655 --> 17:01.517
I'm glad I have it and she
Doesn't.

17:25.448 --> 17:33.448
 come on in, guys.

17:35.068 --> 17:38.586
Kama getting your first look at
The new manu tribe.

17:38.620 --> 17:42.275
Reem voted out at first tribal
Council.

17:42.310 --> 17:43.379
All right.

17:43.413 --> 17:45.482
You guys ready to get to today's
Immunity challenge?

17:45.517 --> 17:46.620
Absolutely.

17:46.655 --> 17:48.665
 first things first,
Got the take back if idol.

17:48.689 --> 17:54.413
No.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.103
 once again immunity
Is back up for grabs.

17:57.137 --> 18:02.379
For today's challenge, both
Tribes will swim out to a cage.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.586
You have to get up and over the
Cage.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.068
You'll then untie a very long
And very heavy snake.

18:07.103 --> 18:10.034
Then you have to get the snake
Out of the cage and back to

18:10.068 --> 18:11.206
Shore.

18:11.241 --> 18:12.793
You'll place it in the cradle.

18:12.827 --> 18:16.379
You'll untie a series of "Not
The newses," releasing numbered

18:16.413 --> 18:17.517
Tiles.

18:17.551 --> 18:21.034
Nose tiles will help you solve
The combination lock.

18:21.068 --> 18:22.758
That lock will releasing a
Rings.

18:22.793 --> 18:25.275
You'll then attempt to land
Those rings on a series of

18:25.310 --> 18:26.344
Targets.

18:26.379 --> 18:29.862
The first tribe to spell
"Immunity" wins immunity.

18:29.896 --> 18:31.182
In addition you're playing for
Reward.

18:31.206 --> 18:32.758
Yes!

18:32.793 --> 18:34.689
 want to know what
You're playing for?

18:34.724 --> 18:35.482
Yes.

18:35.517 --> 18:36.734
 today you have a choice.

18:36.758 --> 18:43.655
You can choose between spices
Plus a few fives and a cutting

18:43.689 --> 18:50.137
Board, or if you're willing to
Do a little work, a dee...

18:50.172 --> 18:54.068
Deluxe survivor fishing kit,
Everything you need to catch

18:54.103 --> 18:56.827
Fish if you're willing to put in
The work and think you can pull

18:56.862 --> 18:58.034
It off.

18:58.068 --> 19:00.010
Losers, tribal council, where
Somebody will be the second

19:00.034 --> 19:03.103
Person voted out of "Survivor
Edge of extinction."

19:03.137 --> 19:04.148
Aubry, you've done this
Challenge before.

19:04.172 --> 19:06.000
Yes, I have.

19:06.034 --> 19:07.000
 how did it go?

19:07.034 --> 19:08.758
That is one heavy snake?

19:08.793 --> 19:10.034
And the result?

19:10.931 --> 19:12.724
 lost.

19:12.758 --> 19:14.931
See if you can change that story
Today.

19:14.965 --> 19:16.931
Kama, one extra person.

19:16.965 --> 19:17.482
Sitting somebody out.

19:17.517 --> 19:18.275
Who is it going to be?

19:18.310 --> 19:19.379
I am.

19:19.413 --> 19:21.827
 all right, julie,
Take a spot on the sit-out.

19:21.862 --> 19:22.793
Bench.

19:22.827 --> 19:24.217
Everybody else take a minute to
Strategize.

19:24.241 --> 19:29.275
We'll get started.

19:31.172 --> 19:32.275
All right.

19:32.310 --> 19:38.344
Here we go, for immunity and
Reward, sure rivers ready?

19:38.379 --> 19:41.344
Go!

19:41.379 --> 19:42.310
Everybody in the water.

19:42.344 --> 19:47.310
Got to get to that cage as fast
As you can.

19:47.344 --> 19:48.896
Kama moving through the water
Quickly.

19:48.931 --> 19:52.931
Wendy very good in the water.

19:52.965 --> 19:55.724
Manu moving much more slowly.

19:55.758 --> 19:59.965
Keith struggling in the water
Like he did in the marooning,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.896
And that's forcing tribe mates
To stay back to help him.

20:04.931 --> 20:06.551
Kama getting up and over.

20:06.586 --> 20:08.172
Manu now working up and over.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.655
Everybody for kama is at the
Cage.

20:10.689 --> 20:12.862
Manu still working to get keith
To the cage.

20:12.896 --> 20:14.586
Keith, come on.

20:14.620 --> 20:16.620
 you cannot start working.

20:16.655 --> 20:18.310
Everybody has to get over.

20:18.344 --> 20:22.965
There are four sets of knots
That will release that snake.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.034
Once you have the snake free,
You have to get it up and out of

20:26.068 --> 20:30.931
The cage.

20:30.965 --> 20:31.827
Let's go, guys.

20:31.862 --> 20:33.103
Keith, jump over.

20:33.137 --> 20:37.413
 keith still taking a
Lot of time to get over.

20:37.448 --> 20:39.862
Now you can start untying.

20:39.896 --> 20:42.724
Kama has their snake free.

20:42.758 --> 20:46.034
Kama now trying to get up and
Over that cage and start pulling

20:46.068 --> 20:46.965
That snake.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.172
That snake weighs a lot.

20:50.206 --> 20:51.965
Kama now with plan.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.862
Aurora is over first.

20:53.896 --> 20:54.965
Keep going.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.448
Get it up.

20:56.482 --> 20:57.793
Come on, guys.

20:57.827 --> 20:59.724
 manu has their snake free.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.320
They can start working it out of
The cage.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.724
One, two, three!

21:02.758 --> 21:05.896
 eric literally
Carrying that snake on his back.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.034
Kama halfway there now.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.655
We need one of the big guys
Up here.

21:11.689 --> 21:15.068
 manu still stuck in
The water, absolutely no.

21:15.103 --> 21:16.689
Progress made with that snake
Yet.

21:16.724 --> 21:18.379
Back up!

21:18.413 --> 21:20.344
 kama doing a nice job.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.448
They've got momentum.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.655
The entire tribe is working
Together now.

21:25.689 --> 21:28.793
Help me, keith, help me, keith.

21:28.827 --> 21:33.620
 you can see manu
Struggling.

21:33.655 --> 21:35.586
Joe leaves it down.

21:35.620 --> 21:36.862
You're good!

21:36.896 --> 21:39.344
Kama now has their snake free.

21:39.379 --> 21:42.620
Manu now getting some momentum.

21:42.655 --> 21:44.379
Suddenly they have more snake
Coming.

21:44.413 --> 21:47.206
There's another big section
Coming out.

21:47.241 --> 21:51.310
Manu trying to get back in this
Now.

21:51.344 --> 21:54.793
It takes all eight tribe members
To carry that snake.

21:54.827 --> 21:57.000
It is heavy.

21:57.034 --> 22:00.034
Manu has three-quarters of their
Snake out.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.482
One last big push will do it.

22:03.517 --> 22:04.931
You're good!

22:04.965 --> 22:07.482
Up and over.

22:07.517 --> 22:10.172
You got to go under.

22:10.206 --> 22:13.103
Very the heavy snake now to drag
Through the sand.

22:13.137 --> 22:16.655
Manu has struggled this entire
Challenge from the get-go, but

22:16.689 --> 22:19.206
Manu is back in this.

22:19.241 --> 22:20.862
Let's get it on the table.

22:20.896 --> 22:23.068
 you have to get up on
That cradle.

22:23.103 --> 22:25.482
Everything about this challenge
Has been hard.

22:25.517 --> 22:27.275
But you have to keep digging.

22:27.310 --> 22:29.379
Now you can start untying.

22:29.413 --> 22:33.689
You're looking for six numbered
Disks.

22:33.724 --> 22:35.310
Manu still fighting.

22:35.344 --> 22:37.241
One, two, three...

22:37.275 --> 22:41.241
One, two, three...

22:41.275 --> 22:42.034
 all right.

22:42.068 --> 22:43.551
You're good.

22:43.586 --> 22:47.758
It's going to be ron solving the
Combination lock for kama.

22:47.793 --> 22:50.172
Manu now has their snake.

22:50.206 --> 22:51.286
You're looking for six disks.

22:51.310 --> 22:56.482
Got to get all six.

22:56.517 --> 22:58.000
You got it.

22:58.034 --> 22:59.551
 there it is.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.103
David whipping through these
Numbers now.

23:02.137 --> 23:07.034
Meanwhile, ron is trying one
Combination and he's got it.

23:07.068 --> 23:08.034
Three people.

23:08.068 --> 23:11.275
David still working on that
Combination lock.

23:11.310 --> 23:11.655
Perfect.

23:11.689 --> 23:12.344
There we go.

23:12.379 --> 23:14.413
David tries another combo.

23:14.448 --> 23:20.000
He's got to hook these rings in
Order spelling "Immunity."

23:20.034 --> 23:23.103
Joe has the first letter for
Kama.

23:23.137 --> 23:23.862
There it is.

23:23.896 --> 23:25.482
David finally involves it.

23:25.517 --> 23:29.172
Manu is back in this.

23:29.206 --> 23:30.034
Chris tosses.

23:30.068 --> 23:31.275
Can he tie it up?

23:31.310 --> 23:32.103
And he does.

23:32.137 --> 23:34.172
We're tied 1-1.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.034
Chris is keeping manu in this.

23:36.068 --> 23:40.000
All the pressure now on the ring
Throwers.

23:40.034 --> 23:41.551
Here comes eric.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.413
Yes, yes, yes!

23:43.448 --> 23:46.034
 eric hooks his second.

23:46.068 --> 23:49.344
Chris still firing for manu.

23:49.379 --> 23:50.275
No.

23:50.310 --> 23:51.931
Here comes joe to get back in.

23:51.965 --> 23:54.758
Throw it till you get it, joe.

23:54.793 --> 23:56.689
Joe lands a third ring for kama.

23:56.724 --> 23:58.034
It is 3-1.

23:58.068 --> 23:59.034
Yes.

23:59.068 --> 24:02.068
 chris now a second
One for manu.

24:02.103 --> 24:03.275
It is 3-2.

24:03.310 --> 24:06.034
It's all you, buddy.

24:06.068 --> 24:07.137
 chris on and off.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.896
I'm ready for you.

24:08.931 --> 24:10.896
 here comes keith for manu.

24:10.931 --> 24:13.034
Keith struggled early in the
Water.

24:13.068 --> 24:15.172
He would like the make it up
Right here.

24:15.206 --> 24:16.000
Keith just misses.

24:16.034 --> 24:17.344
Good job, keith.

24:17.379 --> 24:18.827
Good hustle.

24:18.862 --> 24:20.137
Beautiful, beautiful.

24:20.172 --> 24:22.655
 eric nails the fourth
For kama.

24:22.689 --> 24:26.275
It is 4-2 now.

24:26.310 --> 24:27.068
Keith tosses.

24:27.103 --> 24:27.586
Way short.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.448
That's all right.

24:29.482 --> 24:29.862
Keith.

24:29.896 --> 24:31.000
Yes, buddy?

24:31.034 --> 24:32.931
Ierk has a fifth for kama.

24:32.965 --> 24:36.448
Kama closing in on it now.

24:36.482 --> 24:39.344
 keith would like the
Close the gap.

24:39.379 --> 24:43.103
Can't get it done.

24:43.137 --> 24:44.931
You know what you got to do.

24:44.965 --> 24:45.931
 chris back in.

24:45.965 --> 24:49.862
Chris is the only one who has
Had any success.

24:49.896 --> 24:53.896
Chris hits the third for manu.

24:53.931 --> 24:55.689
Joe hits the sixth one.

24:55.724 --> 24:57.172
Kama is starting to close in.

24:57.206 --> 25:00.034
Chris has got to pick up the
Pace.

25:00.068 --> 25:06.379
Chris snags the fourth ring,
Keeping manu in it.

25:06.413 --> 25:08.586
Joe hooks the seventh ring.

25:08.620 --> 25:10.620
Kama has one left.

25:10.655 --> 25:13.275
Here comes eric to close it out.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.655
Chris trying to stay in it.

25:14.689 --> 25:16.172
Just misses.

25:16.206 --> 25:20.206
Eric could win it right here for
Kama.

25:20.241 --> 25:22.344
And he does!

25:22.379 --> 25:27.413
Kama wins immunity sending manu
Back the tribal council.

25:27.448 --> 25:33.689
Kama, kama, kama, kama.

25:38.344 --> 25:44.379
 kama back-to-back
Challenge wins.

25:44.413 --> 25:46.482
Once again nobody going home

25:46.517 --> 25:47.379
From your tribe.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.551
In addition, you have a choice
Of reward.

25:49.586 --> 25:50.517
What are you going to do?

25:50.551 --> 25:52.793
Well, we're going to do the
Fishing gear.

25:52.827 --> 25:55.862
Fishing gear will be waiting
For you back at camp.

25:55.896 --> 26:00.241
No tribal council back at camp.

26:00.275 --> 26:01.586
Nice work.

26:01.620 --> 26:05.379
All right, manu, for the second
Time this season, somebody from

26:05.413 --> 26:06.493
Your tribe will be voted out.

26:06.517 --> 26:07.689
Grab your stuff.

26:07.724 --> 26:08.310
Head back to camp.

26:08.344 --> 26:09.689
See you tonight at tribal.

26:09.724 --> 26:12.379
Losing our second challenge
Definitely is deflating.

26:12.413 --> 26:13.620
It hurts.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.907
But now I'm thinking maybe this
Is not a bitheir equation of

26:15.931 --> 26:18.551
Just wentworth or wendy even
Though they're going to war with

26:18.586 --> 26:19.137
Each other.

26:19.172 --> 26:22.034
Maybe there's plan "C."

26:22.068 --> 26:24.034
Keith is a liability in
Challenges.

26:24.068 --> 26:28.034
Maybe a new game plan has to be
Enacted.

26:42.655 --> 26:46.137
Well, wasn't for a lack
Of trying.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.103
Good job.

26:48.137 --> 26:48.931
Amazing.

26:48.965 --> 26:50.148
You got four letters on your
Own.

26:50.172 --> 26:51.862
Nothing you could have done.

26:51.896 --> 26:52.941
Nothing you could have done.

26:52.965 --> 26:53.482
That's all right.

26:53.517 --> 26:54.310
Sorry.

26:54.344 --> 26:57.068
You have nothing to apologize
For.

26:57.103 --> 26:58.724
The challenge was a disaster.

26:58.758 --> 27:00.206
My swimming was bad.

27:00.241 --> 27:02.896
Chris had to help me a lot.

27:02.931 --> 27:06.758
And then the rings toss, I just
Look home.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.655
So it did not go as landed.

27:08.689 --> 27:11.379
Before we lost 24 challenge, I
Was sure that wendy was going

27:11.413 --> 27:14.068
Home, but now I'm thinking that,
You know, my name could be on

27:14.103 --> 27:18.724
The chopping block, so this
Could be my last day here

27:18.758 --> 27:19.310
Playing survivor.

27:19.344 --> 27:23.379
So what do you think?

27:23.413 --> 27:28.448
After the challenge I'm thinking
Keith is the one to go now.

27:28.482 --> 27:29.344
He's a liability.

27:29.379 --> 27:31.172
At this point we're down to
Numbers.

27:31.206 --> 27:32.379
We can't lose again.

27:32.413 --> 27:33.241
We need strength.

27:33.275 --> 27:35.103
And keith is not strong in
Challenges.

27:35.137 --> 27:38.172
He's killing us.

27:38.206 --> 27:39.793
So all these things add up.

27:39.827 --> 27:42.689
I'm thinking to myself, how is
Keith in this game helping the

27:42.724 --> 27:43.275
Wardog out.

27:43.310 --> 27:44.137
The answer is he's not.

27:44.172 --> 27:48.793
I don't think...
They're coming up.

27:48.827 --> 27:50.517
I knew this would happen.

27:50.551 --> 27:52.827
Wardog is leading the charge to
Vote out keith.

27:52.862 --> 27:53.655
It's stupid.

27:53.689 --> 27:58.206
I don't know what he's thinking.

27:58.241 --> 28:01.620
Yeah, he's failed miserably, but
He's not a threat to anybody,

28:01.655 --> 28:03.034
Whereas windy wants to get me
Out.

28:03.068 --> 28:05.620
So I am not happy.

28:05.655 --> 28:07.241
I think it's got to be keith.

28:07.275 --> 28:09.517
He's a complete liability in
Challenges.

28:09.551 --> 28:10.965
Wendy is diving down.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.275
She's a good swimmer.

28:12.310 --> 28:15.000
She's as tough as any of those
Females.

28:15.034 --> 28:15.896
What are you doing?

28:15.931 --> 28:17.310
Okay.

28:17.344 --> 28:21.241
I new convinces wardog to
Vote out wentworth was going to

28:21.275 --> 28:25.758
Be difficult, and sure enough,
Wardog is very adamant that

28:25.793 --> 28:29.413
Keith is going home, so now I
Don't think that I have the five

28:29.448 --> 28:32.517
Votes I need to get rid of
Wentworth.

28:32.551 --> 28:34.896
It's like, damn.

28:34.931 --> 28:37.079
The they're up there talking
About possibly getting keith

28:37.103 --> 28:40.103
Out, because he was a no show.

28:40.137 --> 28:42.793
Unfortunately, keith kind of
Shot himself in the foot, which

28:42.827 --> 28:44.206
Kind of sucks.

28:44.241 --> 28:45.551
Because he's a good kid.

28:45.586 --> 28:48.827
And I know that this game means
A lot to him.

28:48.862 --> 28:51.517
I'm so freakin' sorry, yo.

28:51.551 --> 28:53.965
You did beyond freaking amazing.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.827
I promise you I tried the
Swimming thing.

28:55.862 --> 28:59.068
I don't know what it was.

28:59.103 --> 29:02.103
All I can tell you is that I
Promise you, like no matter at

29:02.137 --> 29:04.793
What point in the game we are
New york I'm never turning my

29:04.827 --> 29:09.482
Back on you, because you have
Helped me way too much.

29:09.517 --> 29:13.517
Literally never, like I promise
You, like ever, like at no point

29:13.551 --> 29:14.689
In the game.

29:14.724 --> 29:18.655
Honestly, I don't want keith
To go, because keith has

29:18.689 --> 29:21.000
Specifically told me, I'm in
With you until the end.

29:21.034 --> 29:23.379
I'm going to stay loyal to you
Before anyone else.

29:23.413 --> 29:30.827
That's not the top of player you
Vote out.

29:30.862 --> 29:36.137
Real quick, is it better to
Keep keith around?

29:36.172 --> 29:37.620
What do you mean?

29:37.655 --> 29:38.965
Win or not win?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.413
Let's say we take out kelley.

29:41.448 --> 29:45.379
I think it's something
Serious to think about, because

29:45.413 --> 29:48.965
I don't know how many
Opportunities in an upcoming

29:49.000 --> 29:49.689
Within we would have.

29:49.724 --> 29:50.655
Exactly.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.689
We're thinking the same
Thing, my friend.

29:52.724 --> 29:56.344
Holy crap, we might still be
Able to take out wentworth, and

29:56.379 --> 30:00.965
The best part of that is chris
Actually came up with the idea.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.103
Chris came to me.

30:02.137 --> 30:04.793
We both think this is the prime
Time for a blind side.

30:04.827 --> 30:11.172
This is huge.

30:11.206 --> 30:14.827
So chris came up to me at the
Water hole and was asking about

30:14.862 --> 30:17.344
Is keith the right person to get
Out next.

30:17.379 --> 30:18.172
What about kelley?

30:18.206 --> 30:19.379
Are you serious?

30:19.413 --> 30:20.517
Yeah.

30:20.551 --> 30:21.620
My god.

30:21.655 --> 30:24.344
This is great.

30:24.379 --> 30:24.827
Yes!

30:24.862 --> 30:25.896
The answer is yes.

30:25.931 --> 30:29.551
If we could get him on board,
You and I, wendy.

30:29.586 --> 30:31.068
We're on board.

30:31.103 --> 30:32.482
That's four.

30:32.517 --> 30:33.551
We only need keith.

30:33.586 --> 30:35.482
Yes, best news of the day.

30:35.517 --> 30:36.655
This is so exciting.

30:36.689 --> 30:39.241
I feel like we've been handed
This gift.

30:39.275 --> 30:43.000
It's christmas, because I'm all
About blind siding wentworth.

30:43.034 --> 30:44.206
I think that's a great idea.

30:44.241 --> 30:47.517
This tribe is not big enough for
Two returning players.

30:47.551 --> 30:50.517
So I want to take her out before
She comes after me.

30:50.551 --> 30:53.517
And as long as everyone is on
Board with this plan, it's

30:53.551 --> 30:54.965
Almost going to happen on its
Own.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.310
Okay.

30:57.344 --> 31:01.517
Chris has approached us about
Getting rid of kelley.

31:01.551 --> 31:02.793
My god.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.034
I'm down.

31:04.068 --> 31:06.000
I'm completely down.

31:06.034 --> 31:06.448
Completely down.

31:06.482 --> 31:09.448
I'm excited.

31:09.482 --> 31:10.517
It's hard in my position.

31:10.551 --> 31:12.931
This is exactly what I wanted.

31:12.965 --> 31:14.931
They have the numbers to vote
Out kelley.

31:14.965 --> 31:20.620
I have new life.

31:20.655 --> 31:21.620
Okay.

31:21.655 --> 31:23.206
We need to think through this.

31:23.241 --> 31:24.344
You and me.

31:24.379 --> 31:27.448
But there's been some
Discussions about now would be a

31:27.482 --> 31:33.379
Really good time to make a move
On wentworth because wentworth

31:33.413 --> 31:36.655
Is one of those players, she's
Only going to use us until she

31:36.689 --> 31:37.172
Doesn't need us anymore.

31:37.206 --> 31:37.965
Correct.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.148
She's good enough to know that.

31:39.172 --> 31:40.827
But here's the thing.

31:40.862 --> 31:45.137
It's like a tribe swap, we're
Talking about a scenario in che

31:45.172 --> 31:48.620
We need a couple because we'll
Be down on numbers, and I think

31:48.655 --> 31:50.862
Wentworth might be a bigger
Target than you and me.

31:50.896 --> 31:51.517
Yeah.

31:51.551 --> 31:53.034
She might be our shield.

31:53.068 --> 31:54.310
That's our thing.

31:54.344 --> 31:57.448
I don't trust wentworth one bit,
But I feel like we all have a

31:57.482 --> 31:58.762
Similar aligned goals right now.

32:00.034 --> 32:02.620
Chris is throwing cold water
On my idea.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.965
He wants to take out wentworth,
But I think that's very

32:06.000 --> 32:06.620
Short-sighted.

32:06.655 --> 32:07.310
She's a returning player.

32:07.344 --> 32:08.034
She's a threat.

32:08.068 --> 32:09.241
She plays the game hard.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.103
She finished fourth place last
Time.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.655
She's a gamer.

32:12.689 --> 32:15.931
But that means she has a bigger
Target on her back than I do.

32:15.965 --> 32:20.103
That's a great reason to keep
Her around.

32:20.137 --> 32:23.931
Bring a goat to the end and take
The spot away from them?

32:23.965 --> 32:25.137
What do you think?

32:25.172 --> 32:28.965
I mean, I think if we could
Take out wentworth first, we

32:29.000 --> 32:30.620
Take out keith next.

32:30.655 --> 32:34.793
Well, we can change it.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.148
It's not too late to go another
Direction.

32:36.172 --> 32:40.172
I want the plan to be my plan,
But I want everybody else to

32:40.206 --> 32:41.482
Feel like it's their plan, too.

32:41.517 --> 32:44.103
I don't want them looking at me
Like I'm trying to call the

32:44.137 --> 32:44.896
Shots.

32:44.931 --> 32:46.758
That will just get me into
Trouble.

32:46.793 --> 32:49.482
So chris and myself, we got to
Make a decision, but if we are

32:49.517 --> 32:55.344
Going to take out wentworth,
This is the vote.

32:55.379 --> 32:57.482
I'm trusting my life with you
Guys tonight.

32:57.517 --> 33:02.379
I know.

33:02.413 --> 33:05.586
People are acting very strange.

33:05.620 --> 33:10.310
It's making me nervous.

33:10.344 --> 33:11.517
There has been a shift.

33:11.551 --> 33:16.068
And I'm like, if I were in their
Shoe, what would I do.

33:16.103 --> 33:19.241
There is no question, I would
Vote me out.

33:19.275 --> 33:23.137
It's not like these people know
Each other's game, burr they do

33:23.172 --> 33:24.310
Know mine.

33:24.344 --> 33:27.034
I don't know who is telling
The truth and who is not.

33:27.068 --> 33:29.689
I've been in this position
Before, and both times I was

33:29.724 --> 33:31.275
Blind sided.

33:31.310 --> 33:35.896
I trust lauren, but not these
Other people.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.103
So my heart is beating very fast
Right now.

33:38.137 --> 33:41.758
I feel like it is going to be
Deeéjaaà vu, and if they take me o

33:41.793 --> 33:45.793
Before keith, I'm going to be so
Pissed off.

34:21.896 --> 34:26.000
So last tribal, seems pretty
Clear reem was the person you

34:26.034 --> 34:28.655
Wanted out, but wendy, you got
Votes, as well.

34:28.688 --> 34:29.896
Yes.

34:29.931 --> 34:32.010
 are you concerned you
Might get votes again the un?

34:32.034 --> 34:35.413
Yeah, I feel like the first
Vote establishes where you are.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.965
So considering I wasn't with
Them for the first vote, maybe

34:38.000 --> 34:39.320
I'll get votes for the second
One.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.585
 wentworth, you also
Received a vote.

34:42.620 --> 34:45.757
Is it unnerving to get a vote at
The first tribal?

34:45.793 --> 34:48.931
Yeah did I want to see my
Name, no, because that means

34:48.965 --> 34:50.206
That your name is coming up.

34:50.241 --> 34:53.172
, we all knew who voted
For wentworth, and it was reem,

34:53.206 --> 34:55.000
But her name is still out there
For sure.

34:55.034 --> 34:57.620
I mean, she's... Thanks, kevin.

34:57.655 --> 34:59.931
I'm not telling you anything
You don't know.

34:59.965 --> 35:03.310
 wentworth, kevin
Pipes in, just so you know, your.

35:03.344 --> 35:04.379
Name is still out there.

35:04.413 --> 35:06.620
But as a returning player, is
That to be expected.

35:06.655 --> 35:08.379
Yeah, I've played before.

35:08.413 --> 35:11.551
People can use that as an asset
Or a negative.

35:11.586 --> 35:14.068
 what is the asset of
A returning player?

35:14.103 --> 35:17.620
I think one asset is that I'm
Always going to be a shield.

35:17.655 --> 35:20.689
I'm always going to be a bigger
Target than most of these

35:20.724 --> 35:22.700
People, especially in the early
Game when people are just trying

35:22.724 --> 35:24.724
To figure out who to get rid of.

35:24.758 --> 35:28.206
I also think that I am a strong
Tribe member as far as like

35:28.241 --> 35:29.482
Winning, like we need to win.

35:29.517 --> 35:31.310
We need numbers right now.

35:31.344 --> 35:33.034
 lauren, you're nodding.

35:33.068 --> 35:34.793
That rings true to you?

35:34.827 --> 35:37.827
My gosh, we can't lose
Again, ever again.

35:37.862 --> 35:40.275
It sucks, it's worst feeling in
The world.

35:40.310 --> 35:43.172
I think if we can have a strong
Tribe, that would be the best

35:43.206 --> 35:44.655
Move.

35:44.689 --> 35:48.448
 keith, the talk seems
To be centering around keeping.

35:48.482 --> 35:49.724
The tribe strong.

35:49.758 --> 35:52.551
Does that concern you in because
No matter how you look at it,

35:52.586 --> 35:54.482
Your challenge performance was a
Disaster.

35:54.517 --> 35:58.000
That's true, but at the same
Time, your longevity in this

35:58.034 --> 36:00.448
Game will not depend on ring
Toss.

36:00.482 --> 36:03.655
One clear-cut rout keeping the
Tribe strong, you could still be

36:03.689 --> 36:06.965
Going to the merge with numbers,
And you have someone that flips.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.896
It will depend on the
Relationships you wild.

36:12.931 --> 36:17.137
 is it fair to keep
The tribe strong and keith did.

36:17.172 --> 36:20.137
Not get it con and he should go
Home, it's easy?

36:20.172 --> 36:22.344
It makes a lot of sense.

36:22.379 --> 36:25.517
You're balancing staying strong
As a tribe, but also staying

36:25.551 --> 36:29.000
Strong as a voting unit, people
You can trust.

36:29.034 --> 36:32.758
This is such a crucial part of
The game strategically.

36:32.793 --> 36:36.482
And today it was even more
Crystal clear, like, all right,

36:36.517 --> 36:38.965
We got to figure some things
Out.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.482
 kevin, two big ideas
Chris just shared, don't want to.

36:42.517 --> 36:45.413
Lose again, which is challenge
Performance.

36:45.448 --> 36:46.620
And trust.

36:46.655 --> 36:47.068
Loyalty.

36:47.103 --> 36:48.275
A good point.

36:48.310 --> 36:53.172
And I think last tribal loyalty,
Performance, then you lose

36:53.206 --> 36:55.620
Again, and all of a sudden
Performance is looking pretty

36:55.655 --> 36:58.000
Important.

36:58.034 --> 36:59.424
Maybe a little strength can go a
Long way.

36:59.448 --> 37:04.000
Is wardog, is there a lot of
Talking at camp?

37:04.034 --> 37:05.068
Are we self-now?

37:05.103 --> 37:07.310
Is that game on, blind sides
Will be coming?

37:07.344 --> 37:09.931
I think there is a lot of
Talking going on.

37:09.965 --> 37:11.931
There's a lot of different ideas
Floating around.

37:11.965 --> 37:14.241
And it's possible somebody does
Get blind sided tonight.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.034
 so where is your
Gauge on how well you think you.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.103
Can read these other people?

37:19.137 --> 37:22.758
I will know tonight if my
Gauge is strong or not.

37:22.793 --> 37:25.655
Those votes get read, I'll know
Where I stand on this tribe.

37:25.689 --> 37:27.103
 david, what's your take?

37:27.137 --> 37:30.655
Do you think tonight's vote will
Be a blind side?

37:30.689 --> 37:33.896
I really believe tonight will
Absolutely be a blind side.

37:33.931 --> 37:37.241
I feel like I could write down
How everyone is going to vote,

37:37.275 --> 37:42.931
And if it doesn't go that way, I
Think the blind side will be on

37:42.965 --> 37:44.172
Me.

37:44.206 --> 37:45.562
 keith, do you think
It's going to be a bloind side?

37:45.586 --> 37:48.310
I think everybody has worked
The game to their advantage to

37:48.344 --> 37:51.206
Make sure they're not the ones
Going home, so I think everyone

37:51.241 --> 37:54.965
Thinks they're not going home,
So, yes, I do think there is

37:55.000 --> 37:56.172
Going to be a blind side.

37:56.206 --> 37:58.896
 wentworth, you can't
Put it any better than, that.

37:58.931 --> 38:01.172
Everybody has talked to
Everybody and is certain they're

38:01.206 --> 38:04.241
Right, which means it can only
Be another blind side.

38:04.275 --> 38:05.838
Yeah, you have the
Conversations you have and you

38:05.862 --> 38:07.172
Hope the vote sticks.

38:07.206 --> 38:10.034
Some people here didn't work out
For them this time.

38:10.068 --> 38:14.689
Who doesn't want to check
Blind side off their list.

38:14.724 --> 38:17.862
Notch the tree, drink from the
Well, blind side.

38:17.896 --> 38:25.896
I think you're fine.

38:27.724 --> 38:30.862
I got pat on the shoulder.

38:30.896 --> 38:34.068
 wardog, what gavin
Said is just being honest.

38:34.103 --> 38:41.896
I think every move you make
Sure a rational decision.

38:41.931 --> 38:44.482
We want our cake and we want to
Eat it to.

38:44.517 --> 38:46.596
Unless I'm dealing with the
Seven best liars in the world,

38:46.620 --> 38:49.931
With the choice today, we can
Make that happen.

38:49.965 --> 38:50.448
 all right.

38:50.482 --> 38:51.965
It is time to vote.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.862
David, you're up.

39:26.620 --> 39:34.620
 I'll go tally the votes.

39:37.689 --> 39:40.044
If anybody has a hidden immunity
Idol and you want the play it,

39:40.068 --> 39:46.758
Now would be the time to do so.

39:46.793 --> 39:47.620
Okay.

39:47.655 --> 39:51.758
I'll read the votes.

39:51.793 --> 39:57.310
First vote, kelley.

39:57.344 --> 40:01.344
Keith.

40:01.379 --> 40:02.551
Wendy.

40:02.586 --> 40:09.137
That's one vote wentworth, one
Vote keith, one vote wendy.

40:09.172 --> 40:10.034
Keith.

40:10.068 --> 40:14.034
That's two votes keith.

40:14.068 --> 40:14.413
Keith.

40:14.448 --> 40:15.620
For real?

40:15.655 --> 40:17.562
 that's three votes
Keith, one vote wentworth, one.

40:17.586 --> 40:21.620
Vote wendy.

40:21.655 --> 40:24.586
Second person voted out of
"Survivor edge of extinction,"

40:24.620 --> 40:25.241
Keith.

40:25.275 --> 40:26.448
That's four, that's enough.

40:26.482 --> 40:29.344
You need to bring me your torch.

40:29.379 --> 40:34.206
Wow, wow, wow.

40:34.241 --> 40:38.379
Y'all think you're still going
To win challenges?

40:38.413 --> 40:41.862
 keith, the tribe has
Spoken.

40:41.896 --> 40:44.517
God.

40:44.551 --> 40:48.000
Dang, dang, dang.

40:48.034 --> 40:56.034
Dang it.

40:57.413 --> 41:04.965
Dang it.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.448
Dang.

41:08.482 --> 41:09.862
You have a decision to make.

41:09.896 --> 41:13.137
If you want a chance to get back
In the game, take the torch and

41:13.172 --> 41:16.689
Get in the boat.

41:16.724 --> 41:21.448
If you do not want the play
Anymore, follow this path and

41:21.482 --> 41:22.827
Your adventure will end.

41:22.862 --> 41:30.862
My god.

41:33.103 --> 41:38.965
Come on.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.724
God.

41:40.758 --> 41:42.758
Come on, god.

41:42.793 --> 41:46.689
My god, come on, god.

41:46.724 --> 41:48.000
Come on, god.

41:48.034 --> 41:50.793
Come on.

41:50.827 --> 41:53.517
Come on, god, come on.

41:53.551 --> 41:55.517
Come on.

41:55.551 --> 41:56.965
Come on, god.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Come on, god.

41:59.034 --> 42:00.310
Come on, jesus.

Survivor... When the cat's out.

42:13.310 --> 42:16.448
Of the bag...

42:16.482 --> 42:18.310
Nobody wants to talk us to.

42:18.344 --> 42:21.137
 you'll need a pack
Mentality.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.758
Kill or be killed.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.482
 or catch a break.

42:24.517 --> 42:28.275
I'm worried because I've
Never broken anything.

42:28.310 --> 42:32.448
I don't know.

42:32.482 --> 42:35.551
I am like so down in the dumps.

42:35.586 --> 42:37.724
I've been here for three
Freakin' days.

42:37.758 --> 42:41.448
And I've eaten maybe a bite or
Two of coconut.

42:41.482 --> 42:42.793
I don't know, man.

42:42.827 --> 42:46.206
If no one shows up, I maze have
The raise that flag.
