WEBVTT

00:00.416 --> 00:03.116
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.527 --> 00:07.062
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.667 --> 00:10.035
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:10.103 --> 00:12.605
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.672 --> 00:14.940
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:15.008 --> 00:17.109
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.177 --> 00:20.346
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.413 --> 00:22.982
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:23.049 --> 00:24.583
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.651 --> 00:26.218
Should we shoot them?

00:26.286 --> 00:28.787
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.855 --> 00:31.190
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.258 --> 00:33.659
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.727 --> 00:35.895
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.962 --> 00:38.397
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.465 --> 00:40.065
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.002 --> 00:48.605
Six years ago, your substitute
therapist was Anson Fullerton.

00:48.672 --> 00:50.006
Who the hell are you?

00:50.074 --> 00:51.441
The organization
that burned you,

00:51.508 --> 00:53.142
I'm the last
one of them.

00:55.246 --> 00:57.080
Anson is the one
who killed Benny.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.484
You're not the only one
he got close to.

01:01.552 --> 01:04.354
You know, Michael, you shouldn't
be so hard on your old man.

01:04.421 --> 01:07.423
He wasn't quite the poisonous
leech you make him out to be.

01:07.491 --> 01:09.359
What makes you
such an expert?

01:09.426 --> 01:12.262
All those years, how many times
did you wish he were dead?

01:12.329 --> 01:14.597
We did it for you.
You're welcome, Michael.

01:22.866 --> 01:26.608
<i>A spy's life rarely starts</i>
<i>with a happy childhood.</i>

01:26.609 --> 01:28.777
<i>The fact is,</i>
<i>the best preparation</i>

01:28.845 --> 01:31.547
<i>for a career filled</i>
<i>with danger and paranoia</i>

01:31.614 --> 01:35.117
<i>is a home life filled with</i>
<i>danger and paranoia.</i>

01:35.185 --> 01:37.786
<i>It makes for a complex</i>
<i>relationship with the past,</i>

01:37.854 --> 01:39.288
<i>under the best</i>
<i>of circumstances.</i>

01:39.356 --> 01:42.691
God...I haven't been here
since we buried him.

01:42.759 --> 01:45.027
Your father
would hate this place.

01:45.095 --> 01:46.729
I can just see him
yelling at some gardener

01:46.796 --> 01:47.963
about all the weeds.

01:50.834 --> 01:53.502
I still can't believe
he died to protect you.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.404
Mom, we heard that
from a murderer

01:55.472 --> 01:57.172
who framed Fiona
for a bombing.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.508
I'm not sure we can
take Anson's word far it.

01:59.576 --> 02:00.909
Maybe not.

02:00.977 --> 02:04.213
But I remember,
just before Frank died,

02:04.280 --> 02:08.183
he was asking about you,
out of the blue.

02:08.251 --> 02:10.818
I didn't have time
to find it odd.

02:12.322 --> 02:15.290
In a week, I was trying to
figure out why he'd gotten drunk

02:15.358 --> 02:16.592
and O.D.'d on heart pills.

02:16.659 --> 02:18.127
I'm telling you,
Michael, it fits.

02:18.194 --> 02:19.495
No, ma, listen.

02:19.562 --> 02:21.330
This is just Anson
trying to get into my head.

02:21.398 --> 02:22.898
No, you listen.

02:22.966 --> 02:26.935
I'm not a spy,
but I'm not a total idiot.

02:27.003 --> 02:28.904
They used Frank
to learn about you.

02:28.972 --> 02:31.073
And when he caught on,
they killed him.

02:31.141 --> 02:33.108
He was a bad man,
Michael.

02:33.176 --> 02:34.843
But even he
had his moments.

02:34.911 --> 02:38.414
Nate's rented a place up
in Daytona Beach for a week.

02:38.481 --> 02:42.184
I'm gonna take off and go up
there, take some time, you know,

02:42.252 --> 02:44.653
try and get used to this.

02:44.721 --> 02:46.388
How do you
get used to this?

02:49.292 --> 02:50.592
You look at me.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.728
You have a job to do.

02:52.796 --> 02:54.196
Make sure Anson
doesn't ruin any more lives.

02:56.199 --> 03:00.035
I'm just not...
I'm not sure how to do that.

03:00.103 --> 03:02.471
Figure it out,
Michael.

03:02.539 --> 03:04.807
You do
whatever you have to do.

03:08.945 --> 03:10.779
How'd it go?

03:10.847 --> 03:13.282
Well, I think I have just
the thing to make you smile.

03:13.349 --> 03:16.285
We finally got something
on Anson I think we can use.

03:16.352 --> 03:17.820
You know how
we thought his money

03:17.887 --> 03:19.388
was completely untraceable?

03:19.456 --> 03:21.423
Well,
that spiky-haired weasel Barry

03:21.491 --> 03:23.225
managed to
make himself useful.

03:23.293 --> 03:25.127
I needed someone sneaky enough
to track the money

03:25.195 --> 03:26.728
without anyone knowing,
especially Anson.

03:26.796 --> 03:28.964
He traced a few mil through
half a dozen shell corporations

03:29.032 --> 03:31.633
into a
Chinese brokerage account,

03:31.701 --> 03:33.368
and finally
a D.C. law firm.

03:33.436 --> 03:35.537
Fi...
Already packed.

03:39.309 --> 03:42.010
<i>Law firms are used to run</i>
<i>all sorts of shady businesses</i>

03:42.078 --> 03:44.246
<i>for good reason.</i>

03:44.314 --> 03:46.248
<i>They're discrete, powerful,</i>
<i>and protected.</i>

03:46.316 --> 03:48.717
<i>Between the high security</i>
<i>and privacy rules,</i>

03:48.785 --> 03:52.221
<i>getting intel from a law office</i>
<i>is more or less impossible,</i>

03:52.288 --> 03:53.655
<i>unless you're willing</i>
<i>to break those rules.</i>

03:53.723 --> 03:56.692
Check out the lady
in the gray skirt suit.

03:56.759 --> 03:58.794
You think you can
match that look by lunch?

03:58.862 --> 04:02.030
You just worry about
getting that badge.

04:05.568 --> 04:07.870
Excuse me. Can you help me?
I am so lost.

04:07.937 --> 04:09.371
I am looking
for the Smithsonian

04:09.439 --> 04:11.106
- I'm a member. First time in D.C.
- Okay.

04:11.174 --> 04:13.041
- I'm very excited, so I got a little lost.
- Uh-huh.

04:13.109 --> 04:14.409
I was on New York.

04:14.477 --> 04:17.144
I made a right on Pennsylvania
and a left on Virginia,

04:17.213 --> 04:18.814
and somehow
I got off constitution.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.214
Oh, there it is --
Smithsonian.

04:20.283 --> 04:22.217
Thank you so much. Can't believe
it was right there.

04:22.285 --> 04:24.219
Yeah, no...problem.

04:24.287 --> 04:27.556
<i>If you can find someone who</i>
<i>fits your general description</i>

04:27.624 --> 04:29.391
<i>and borrow</i>
<i>their identification,</i>

04:29.459 --> 04:31.393
<i>the perfect wig</i>
<i>and a new pair of glasses</i>

04:31.461 --> 04:33.896
<i>can get you a free ticket</i>
<i>to look around.</i>

04:33.963 --> 04:36.532
<i>At least until the firm's</i>
<i>lawyers get back from lunch.</i>

04:36.599 --> 04:38.667
He's with me.

04:40.436 --> 04:43.739
There's no "Anson" or
"Fullerton" in the client files.

04:43.806 --> 04:45.173
You see anything?

04:45.241 --> 04:46.775
Nothing useful.

04:46.843 --> 04:48.110
Just indecipherable financial
documents and property deeds.

04:48.177 --> 04:50.245
Keep looking.
Might be under a different name.

04:50.313 --> 04:51.747
Well, I hardly see
any names at all.

04:51.814 --> 04:53.348
Just references
to other file numbers.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.851
Keeping names off documents
is a good idea

04:55.919 --> 04:58.654
when your clients are running
black ops and killing people.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.057
What do you got?
Find something on Anson?

05:02.125 --> 05:05.127
Not Anson.
But recognize him?

05:08.765 --> 05:10.065
It's been a while.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.568
Michael Westen, you made
a big mistake crossing me.

05:12.635 --> 05:15.337
Now you're gonna see what it's
like having me for an enemy.

05:15.405 --> 05:18.807
Fi, this file was updated
two days ago. It's active.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.543
What does Anson want with a man
who's locked in prison for life?

05:21.611 --> 05:25.438
Find that out, and we're
one step ahead of Anson.

05:25.538 --> 05:29.038
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 5x17</font>

Original Air Date on December 8, 2011

05:29.039 --> 05:32.489
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

05:32.508 --> 05:34.104
Man, I thought
I saw the last of this guy

05:34.105 --> 05:35.338
when we sent him
to prison.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.541
I mean, you really think
he's working with Anson?

05:37.608 --> 05:39.609
Vaughn's locked in the
darkest hole the government has.

05:39.677 --> 05:41.111
He's not
talking to anyone.

05:41.178 --> 05:43.880
Which means Anson's working on
his own, moving Vaughn's assets.

05:43.948 --> 05:45.515
Yeah, but these
so-called "assets"

05:45.583 --> 05:47.450
look just like
more meaningless numbers.

05:47.518 --> 05:50.153
I mean, there's no way to know
what Anson's up to.

05:50.221 --> 05:51.655
Unless I talk to Vaughn.

05:51.722 --> 05:53.924
Excuse me? You planning a trip
to Guantanamo?

05:53.991 --> 05:56.826
No, Pearce can have the CIA
bring Vaughn here for a chat.

05:56.894 --> 05:58.261
I need to call Jesse,

05:58.329 --> 06:01.064
see if his firm can turn
these numbers into names.

06:01.132 --> 06:03.300
I don't want to talk to Vaughn
without doing my homework.

06:03.367 --> 06:04.200
Amen to that, brother.

06:08.506 --> 06:10.774
No, it's no problem, Mike.
Just send me the documents.

06:10.841 --> 06:12.475
I'll put
the research department on it.

06:12.543 --> 06:14.077
And this needs to
stay quiet.

06:14.145 --> 06:16.246
Yeah. What doesn't with you,
man? Please.

06:16.314 --> 06:21.017
Look, I got my friend's
retirement...party right now.

06:21.085 --> 06:22.852
I'll check in later.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.220
Yeah.

06:30.194 --> 06:32.228
Ian.

06:32.296 --> 06:34.331
I thought you said
this was a party, man.

06:34.398 --> 06:35.565
Where's everybody at?

06:35.633 --> 06:37.233
Invitation said a gathering,
not a party.

06:37.301 --> 06:38.902
You're the only one
that got it, Porter.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.837
Have a seat.

06:40.905 --> 06:42.606
So I take it
there's no cake.

06:42.673 --> 06:44.307
What are you drinking?

06:44.375 --> 06:46.176
Just whatever
he's having.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.615
What's up?

06:51.682 --> 06:53.116
Question --

06:53.184 --> 06:54.718
I've heard the stories
about what you've been up to

06:54.785 --> 06:56.186
since you left CIFA,

06:56.253 --> 06:58.788
you and that guy Westen
kicking ass.

06:58.856 --> 07:00.023
Those stories true?

07:00.091 --> 07:03.493
Um...Yeah. Yeah.
Most of them.

07:03.561 --> 07:04.728
Good.

07:04.795 --> 07:06.863
I'm leaving
government work, too,

07:06.931 --> 07:09.199
and I know somebody
that needs an ass-kicking.

07:09.266 --> 07:11.835
It's Yash Ahluwalia,

07:11.902 --> 07:14.404
diplomat
with the Indian consulate.

07:14.472 --> 07:17.107
State department
assigned me to him in 2002.

07:17.174 --> 07:19.442
Said they needed their "best"
working with him.

07:19.510 --> 07:22.746
I spend most of my time
sorting out his parking tickets,

07:22.813 --> 07:24.914
keeping him out of jail
when he roughs up a call girl.

07:24.982 --> 07:27.083
Covering for diplomats
is kind of part of your gig.

07:27.151 --> 07:28.818
You may not like it,
but it is what it is.

07:28.886 --> 07:30.987
And one more thing.

07:31.055 --> 07:33.189
I'm helping him
smuggle diamonds.

07:33.257 --> 07:36.426
Okay.

07:36.494 --> 07:40.296
Okay. If you're doing something
illegal, I can't help you.

07:40.364 --> 07:42.932
That's just it. Under the
Vienna Convention, it's legal.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.234
He does it
all under diplomatic cover.

07:44.301 --> 07:47.003
Cops can't touch him.

07:47.071 --> 07:48.471
And guess
who authorizes it all.

07:48.539 --> 07:50.607
What about you boss? Why can't
you just talk to him about it?

07:50.675 --> 07:53.209
I already tried that.

07:53.277 --> 07:55.612
Station chief said to
hold my nose and do my job.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.147
And I did.

07:57.214 --> 08:02.719
Until I got tired of waking up

08:02.787 --> 08:03.720
and seeing crap like this.

08:08.025 --> 08:11.094
It's not just smuggling.
He's getting away with murder.

08:11.162 --> 08:13.363
Listen, Jesse,
I've seen all the proof.

08:13.431 --> 08:15.365
Every time he does a deal,

08:15.433 --> 08:18.735
he takes me and the buyer
into a secure room.

08:18.803 --> 08:20.370
While I'm filling out
documents,

08:20.438 --> 08:22.739
I'm sitting right next to
all the evidence --

08:22.807 --> 08:24.107
falsified certificates,

08:24.175 --> 08:26.676
diplomatic pouches
full of raw diamonds, all of it.

08:26.744 --> 08:29.713
He's got a sale
coming up this week.

08:29.780 --> 08:32.649
If I can get that evidence,
I can take him down.

08:32.717 --> 08:34.551
Ian, do you know
what you're getting into?

08:34.618 --> 08:36.453
You're gonna lose your job.
You're gonna lose your pension.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.899
You can end up in jail
yourself. This is --

08:37.924 --> 08:39.089
I don't care!

08:39.090 --> 08:42.125
People are dying.
I don't want to retire

08:42.193 --> 08:46.429
knowing that my life's work
was helping this son of a bitch.

08:48.332 --> 08:50.066
Please. Jesse.

08:51.836 --> 08:53.703
Look, I'm not
making any promises, man.

08:53.771 --> 08:55.038
I'll --
I'll check it out.

08:55.106 --> 08:57.273
Where can I
find this guy?

08:57.341 --> 09:00.443
He's having dinner with a buyer
on Ocean Drive in an hour.

09:00.511 --> 09:02.178
In an hour?
Mm-hmm.

09:02.246 --> 09:04.180
Guess I got to
make some phone calls.

09:07.651 --> 09:11.321
<i>Audio surveillance is</i>
<i>more difficult than it sounds.</i>

09:11.388 --> 09:13.690
<i>Taking coherent notes</i>
<i>on a half-heard conversation</i>

09:13.758 --> 09:15.158
<i>is a challenge.</i>

09:15.226 --> 09:17.127
<i>And aiming a directional mike</i>
<i>at a target</i>

09:17.194 --> 09:20.063
<i>without being too obvious</i>
<i>takes the skills of a marksman.</i>

09:20.131 --> 09:21.397
Okay.
How are we doing here?

09:21.465 --> 09:23.666
- You got the sound up?
- Yeah, it's up right here.

09:23.734 --> 09:25.435
You're lucky
you're a friend of Jesse's,

09:25.503 --> 09:28.037
'cause I'm getting a serious
crick in my neck here.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.073
Is it worth it?
Is he saying anything good?

09:30.141 --> 09:32.709
Shut up! Your dirty diplomat's
finishing his business.

09:32.777 --> 09:36.045
You know,
I like the deal.

09:36.113 --> 09:37.514
And the price
is a little high,

09:37.581 --> 09:39.282
but for what you're bringing me,
I-I don't mind spending it.

09:39.350 --> 09:41.217
I just want to know
that you can deliver.

09:41.285 --> 09:43.186
I don't want police
or customs.

09:43.254 --> 09:45.188
You know
who protects my shipments?

09:45.256 --> 09:46.489
The police.

09:46.557 --> 09:49.159
And the U.S. Customs
that you're so worried about.

09:49.226 --> 09:52.061
Diplomatic pouches
are untouchable.

09:52.129 --> 09:54.097
Your concern
is getting my money.

09:57.067 --> 10:01.004
I'll have it tomorrow morning.
9:00, soon as the bank opens.

10:01.071 --> 10:03.873
I'll be ready
for your call.

10:03.941 --> 10:05.608
Okeydokey.

10:05.676 --> 10:06.843
What?

10:06.911 --> 10:08.144
What?
What did they say?

10:08.212 --> 10:10.280
What? What's going on?
What did he say?

10:10.347 --> 10:14.684
Bad news. The deal's
not next week. It's tomorrow.

10:14.752 --> 10:16.619
So, we have to
go in tonight?

10:16.687 --> 10:17.821
Is this guy serious?

10:17.888 --> 10:19.756
That's not
how field-ops work, Ian.

10:19.824 --> 10:21.624
We got to scout.
We got to make a plan.

10:21.692 --> 10:22.826
It's gonna take a few days
at least.

10:22.893 --> 10:24.861
We got to buy ourselves
some time.

10:26.764 --> 10:28.398
Okay, how about this?

10:28.465 --> 10:30.667
Take out the sleazebag
in the silk shirt,

10:30.734 --> 10:32.902
and while Yash is scrambling
to put together another deal,

10:32.970 --> 10:34.637
we figure out how to take him out.
- I like it.

10:34.705 --> 10:36.005
Wait. We can't.

10:36.073 --> 10:37.574
Yash will get suspicious
if the buyer just disappears.

10:37.641 --> 10:39.275
No, the buyer's not gonna
disappear. The money is.

10:39.343 --> 10:41.277
Fortunately, he just told us
when he's gonna move it.

10:41.345 --> 10:43.680
Okay, but, with Mike dealing
with this Vaughn business,

10:43.747 --> 10:45.114
all we got team wise
is Fi.

10:45.182 --> 10:47.083
That's perfect. Robbing a guy
in broad daylight --

10:47.151 --> 10:49.219
that's a Fi kind of job.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:58.295 --> 11:00.430
Michael, do we have
an appointment?

11:00.497 --> 11:01.698
Friends don't need
appointments.

11:01.765 --> 11:03.199
This will be quick.
I'm just following up.

11:03.267 --> 11:04.801
I made a request --
you sure did.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.536
You want me to haul
Vaughn Anderson out of his cage

11:06.604 --> 11:07.704
for a chat.

11:07.771 --> 11:09.405
Just trying to
clear up some loose ends

11:09.473 --> 11:11.474
on my burn notice investigation.
- That's interesting.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.009
Hard to believe
a report this thick

11:13.077 --> 11:14.644
doesn't
tell the whole story.

11:14.712 --> 11:16.145
I wish it did.

11:16.213 --> 11:18.681
I noticed the clearance level
on this meeting you want

11:18.749 --> 11:20.817
is special access.

11:20.885 --> 11:23.319
So I'm supposed to put you
in a room with Vaughn,

11:23.387 --> 11:25.555
but I can't be
part of the conversation?

11:25.623 --> 11:27.624
Well,
you can make a request.

11:27.691 --> 11:29.259
No, no, no.
Don't patronize me.

11:29.326 --> 11:31.094
That would take months,
and you know it.

11:31.161 --> 11:32.662
What I want
is a guarantee

11:32.730 --> 11:35.665
that this request isn't going to
blow up in my face.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.734
It's just routine.
There's nothing routine

11:37.801 --> 11:40.203
about getting a prisoner
transferred from Guantanamo.

11:40.271 --> 11:42.372
Pearce,
we're on the same side here.

11:42.439 --> 11:43.706
I promise.

11:43.774 --> 11:45.208
I'm gonna
hold you to that promise.

11:45.276 --> 11:49.045
I'll fly Vaughn to our detention
facility in Tampa tomorrow.

11:49.113 --> 11:50.179
Thank you.

11:50.247 --> 11:51.948
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

11:52.016 --> 11:54.684
See this mountain
of paperwork?

11:56.020 --> 11:57.787
All of that
is for your request.

11:57.855 --> 12:00.556
Y-you're gonna
share my pain.

12:00.624 --> 12:01.891
You get your own pen.

12:07.464 --> 12:10.700
<i>Most people assume that</i>
<i>the best time to rob someone</i>

12:10.768 --> 12:12.402
<i>is on a dark street at night.</i>

12:12.469 --> 12:16.172
<i>But the fact is, a daytime</i>
<i>heist has its advantages.</i>

12:16.240 --> 12:18.474
<i>Bystanders are more focused</i>
<i>on their own business</i>

12:18.542 --> 12:20.043
<i>than on what's going on</i>
<i>around them.</i>

12:20.110 --> 12:21.911
<i>And, most importantly,</i>

12:21.979 --> 12:23.446
<i>the target is less likely</i>
<i>to have his guard up.</i>

12:23.514 --> 12:27.517
There's our boy, and his bag
looks about $500,000 heavier.

12:27.584 --> 12:28.918
Okay, Fi,
just make sure

12:28.986 --> 12:31.287
the passenger door
is unlocked this time, please.

12:31.355 --> 12:33.423
Well, you never could
take a joke, could you, Sam?

12:33.490 --> 12:36.125
<i>Daytime robberies do have</i>
<i>one major drawback, however.</i>

12:36.193 --> 12:39.340
<i>If a cop shows up at the wrong time,</i>
<i>it's a lot harder to hide.</i>

12:39.654 --> 12:41.422
Oh, great, the cops.
I'm standing right here.

12:41.598 --> 12:42.865
I'm right here
in front of you.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.901
You don't have to
keep writing the ticket. Stop.

12:44.969 --> 12:47.337
The moron parked in a red zone,
Fi. No go. No go.

12:47.404 --> 12:49.872
All right. I got to call Jesse,
tell we hit a snag.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.075
Save the call, Sam.
I have an idea.

12:52.142 --> 12:54.744
Why do I always feel those are the
last words I'm ever gonna hear?

12:54.812 --> 12:56.145
Don't worry.
I'll do the hard part.

12:56.213 --> 12:58.848
Meet me at the parking lot
behind the McCarthy building.

12:58.916 --> 13:00.984
And be ready
to drive a stick.

13:07.624 --> 13:10.159
<i>The key to manipulating</i>
<i>another driver</i>

13:10.227 --> 13:11.260
<i>is to make them reactive.</i>

13:13.364 --> 13:16.299
<i>If you want them to speed up,</i>
<i>ride their bumper.</i>

13:16.367 --> 13:18.601
<i>If you want them to slow down,</i>
<i>box them in.</i>

13:19.803 --> 13:22.071
What's your problem,
bitch?

13:22.139 --> 13:24.240
<i>And when you need them</i>
<i>to make a turn,</i>

13:24.308 --> 13:25.875
<i>steer them</i>
<i>towards an obstacle.</i>

13:25.943 --> 13:27.944
<i>It's a lot like dancing...</i>

13:29.413 --> 13:31.748
<i>...At 60 miles an hour</i>
<i>into oncoming traffic.</i>

13:38.956 --> 13:40.123
Hope you're in place,
Sam,

13:40.190 --> 13:41.758
because
we're coming your way now.

13:51.935 --> 13:55.505
What the hell are you doing?
Are you insane?

13:57.007 --> 13:58.708
Oh, brother,
you have no idea.

13:58.776 --> 14:00.710
Hey,
sweet ride you got there.

14:00.778 --> 14:01.978
Mind if I take it
for a spin?

14:02.046 --> 14:04.480
Wait.
Let me get my bag.

14:04.548 --> 14:05.314
Sorry. Finders keepers.

14:19.722 --> 14:20.895
There's no way.

14:20.896 --> 14:22.464
I thought
if we took out Yash's buyer,

14:22.531 --> 14:25.166
we'd have time to come up
with a plan that worked.

14:25.234 --> 14:27.202
Come on, Mike, the guy's
getting rich off blood diamonds,

14:27.269 --> 14:28.736
and he's killing people
in the process.

14:28.804 --> 14:30.438
Breaking into a diplomatic
residence that's well guarded

14:30.506 --> 14:32.207
even with weeks to plan,
it's iffy.

14:32.274 --> 14:33.627
With a few days, impossible.

14:33.652 --> 14:35.082
I thought impossible
was what you did.

14:37.413 --> 14:39.414
He's heard a few
Michael Westen stories.

14:39.482 --> 14:42.383
I'm sorry,
but it's not about expertise.

14:42.451 --> 14:44.752
Even if you could sneak in,
the safe you described,

14:44.820 --> 14:46.454
it would take hours
to break into --

14:46.522 --> 14:47.789
hours you don't have.

14:47.857 --> 14:49.390
Wait a minute.

14:49.458 --> 14:50.792
What if we're already inside
with the evidence

14:50.860 --> 14:52.427
and all we got to do
is get out?

14:52.495 --> 14:53.761
Come on, just humor me, Mike.
Come on.

14:56.866 --> 14:59.000
Well, if getting out
was your only problem,

14:59.068 --> 15:00.502
you'd have a chance.

15:00.569 --> 15:02.103
Actually, a good one.

15:02.171 --> 15:04.205
The back wall of this room
is exposed and unguarded.

15:04.273 --> 15:05.640
It also has no door.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.842
With the right kind of blast,
you make your own door.

15:07.910 --> 15:10.145
All right, that's it.

15:10.212 --> 15:12.247
I mean, you got to be there with
the buyers when the deal goes down.

15:12.314 --> 15:13.715
Right?
Yeah

15:13.782 --> 15:16.384
okay. I'm Yash's new buyer.
We get in, we take care of Yash,

15:16.452 --> 15:18.052
get the evidence,
and we get out.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.088
Yash would never do a deal with
some random guy off the street.

15:20.156 --> 15:21.556
He wouldn't be
off the street,

15:21.624 --> 15:23.158
because you would be
introducing him.

15:23.225 --> 15:25.960
Well, what do I say? "Yash,
meet my diamond-dealing buddy."

15:26.028 --> 15:28.263
No, you tell him
you're done being a boy scout,

15:28.330 --> 15:30.098
and you're ready
for a real payday.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.467
But you'd have to
sell it.

15:32.535 --> 15:34.235
Look, it's your call.

15:34.303 --> 15:35.303
If you're not up for it,
just say the word.

15:35.371 --> 15:38.106
I'm in.

15:38.174 --> 15:41.609
You think you could use
Fi and Sam on this one?

15:41.677 --> 15:42.877
I have to
go up to Tampa.

15:42.945 --> 15:44.412
Yeah, it's not problem.
We got it under control.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.847
Tell Vaughn
I said what's up.

16:03.799 --> 16:05.667
Welcome back
to the citrus state.

16:06.468 --> 16:09.571
Michael Westen.

16:09.638 --> 16:11.506
Shoe's on
the other foot now, huh?

16:11.574 --> 16:12.907
Yeah, I'm not here
to reminisce.

16:12.975 --> 16:14.275
I'm here to talk about
Anson Fullerton.

16:16.779 --> 16:19.080
Yeah, you didn't think
I knew about Anson.

16:19.148 --> 16:20.815
Let's just say
he got in touch.

16:20.883 --> 16:22.450
I can't say
I saw that one coming.

16:22.518 --> 16:24.953
I'm here to offer you
a deal.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.721
Your old friend's
planning something big.

16:26.789 --> 16:27.956
You help me
figure out what,

16:28.023 --> 16:29.691
I'll try to make your life
a little better.

16:29.758 --> 16:32.060
My life?

16:32.127 --> 16:34.128
I don't think I'd call it
much of a life.

16:34.196 --> 16:36.831
I've been in the hole for
nine months now thanks to you.

16:36.899 --> 16:39.467
This is the longest conversation
I've had since my interrogation.

16:39.535 --> 16:42.470
Anson has been wiring money
to a lawyer in D.C.,

16:42.538 --> 16:44.472
a lawyer
you used to work with

16:44.540 --> 16:46.975
according to some files
that came into my possession.

16:47.042 --> 16:50.645
Now it's starting to
make sense.

16:50.713 --> 16:52.680
Where's the rest
of this file?

16:52.748 --> 16:56.351
You agree to help me,
and I'll show you the rest.

16:56.418 --> 16:58.086
I'll tell you
what I'll do.

16:58.153 --> 17:00.255
Bring me in a bottle of scotch
and the rest of that file,

17:00.322 --> 17:03.091
and I'll check it out
for you.

17:03.158 --> 17:06.461
Anything for my old pal
Michael Westen, right?

17:06.528 --> 17:08.863
Why the sarcasm, Vaughn?

17:10.866 --> 17:14.836
From what I see,
I'm the only friend you have.

17:22.111 --> 17:24.378
<i>When approaching</i>
<i>an underworld target,</i>

17:24.445 --> 17:26.381
<i>you don't get points</i>
<i>for being subtle.</i>

17:26.448 --> 17:28.650
<i>Most bad guys live in a world</i>

17:28.717 --> 17:30.018
<i>where the point of money</i>
<i>is to show it off.</i>

17:30.085 --> 17:31.519
<i>It's one of the few times</i>

17:31.587 --> 17:33.988
<i>having a blue silk shirt</i>
<i>and diamonds on your watch</i>

17:34.056 --> 17:36.324
<i>sends the message that</i>
<i>you're a good business partner.</i>

17:36.392 --> 17:37.825
You okay?

17:37.893 --> 17:39.027
Mm-hmm.

17:39.094 --> 17:40.762
Look,
if you're not up for this,

17:40.829 --> 17:42.530
now would be the time
to tell me.

17:42.598 --> 17:44.899
Just blood pressure meds.
I'm fine.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.467
How are you doing?

17:48.570 --> 17:51.372
What are you doing here? I told
you today's meeting was off.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.709
And who is this?

17:54.777 --> 17:56.411
Look, I know why
today's meeting's off.

17:56.478 --> 17:59.180
Your deal fell through,
right?

17:59.248 --> 18:01.816
I brought, uh --
this is Mr. Ray.

18:01.884 --> 18:02.850
Hmm? Hey.

18:02.918 --> 18:06.054
He can be your...
New deal.

18:06.121 --> 18:07.955
I mean...Buyer.

18:08.023 --> 18:10.625
Heard you got some fine products
straight from the source.

18:10.693 --> 18:14.228
I am a buyer of bling.
Let's make this happen, man.

18:16.765 --> 18:20.234
Look, I don't know what
you think you are playing at,

18:20.302 --> 18:22.804
but you are
making a terrible mistake.

18:22.871 --> 18:25.273
And I suggest
that you leave now...

18:25.341 --> 18:26.507
Before this gets worse.

18:26.575 --> 18:28.042
Look, I'm not stupid.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.944
I know all about
your little side business.

18:30.012 --> 18:31.646
But I'm not trying to
rock the boat.

18:31.714 --> 18:33.047
I want to help.

18:33.115 --> 18:35.650
All these years,

18:35.718 --> 18:37.618
and this is
the first I hear

18:37.686 --> 18:40.988
of your
entrepreneurial ambitions?

18:41.056 --> 18:43.091
Look at me.

18:43.158 --> 18:46.094
I'm almost 60.
I drive a Taurus.

18:46.161 --> 18:48.629
I live in an old
two-bedroom condo.

18:48.697 --> 18:50.798
It's worth less
than I paid for it.

18:50.866 --> 18:54.335
I just want a taste...
Of this.

18:57.673 --> 19:00.608
Fine. I'll meet
this buyer of yours.

19:00.676 --> 19:01.743
Good.

19:01.810 --> 19:03.845
Go home.

19:03.912 --> 19:04.846
Now.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.650
Yeah, okay.

19:09.718 --> 19:12.153
Come with me.

19:12.221 --> 19:14.021
We're gonna
get to know each other.

19:14.089 --> 19:16.824
First thing you need to
know about me -- Capricorn.

19:16.892 --> 19:19.994
I'm all about the money,
my friend.

19:20.062 --> 19:21.295
So...

19:21.363 --> 19:24.599
You're in the market
for raw diamonds.

19:24.666 --> 19:25.900
Wouldn't be here
if I wasn't.

19:25.968 --> 19:28.870
You'll find my prices
on the high end.

19:28.937 --> 19:31.572
But that's because
I eliminate your risk.

19:31.640 --> 19:35.443
Our man, Ian, arranges transport
of the product and the payments

19:35.511 --> 19:37.178
in diplomatically-sealed
pouches.

19:37.246 --> 19:39.447
Hey, if you can
take the headache

19:39.515 --> 19:40.882
out of transport
and delivery

19:40.949 --> 19:42.784
I would call that price
a bargain,

19:42.851 --> 19:44.952
and I would call you
my new best friend, okay?

19:45.020 --> 19:47.555
You know, it's unusual
to find an American

19:47.623 --> 19:49.891
who cuts and polishes
his own stones.

19:49.958 --> 19:51.592
That's what separates the men
from the boys.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.428
But you must understand,
I'm a cautious man,

19:53.495 --> 19:54.929
and I need to be sure

19:54.997 --> 19:57.432
that you are handling
the product in-house.

19:57.499 --> 20:00.668
Involving another party
is not a risk I wish to take.

20:00.736 --> 20:04.806
I promise that I will not
ask anyone for help.

20:04.873 --> 20:06.407
Huh? You can write that
in the Bible.

20:06.475 --> 20:08.810
Well, showing
is always better than telling.

20:08.877 --> 20:11.045
I'd like to see
your facility...

20:11.113 --> 20:12.313
Now.

20:16.118 --> 20:17.819
Let me tell you something.

20:17.886 --> 20:20.021
You don't need to see
a damn thing but my money

20:20.088 --> 20:22.190
when we make the deal,
you understand me?

20:22.257 --> 20:26.127
Trust but verify,
my friend.

20:26.195 --> 20:28.062
And in this line of work,

20:28.130 --> 20:31.899
it's verify...Or die.

20:36.872 --> 20:38.265
Hey, you want to see my shop.
I'll show you my shop.

20:38.290 --> 20:39.490
What do I have a damn?

20:39.775 --> 20:42.410
Make a quick phone call,
set it up.

20:42.478 --> 20:43.744
How'd this happen?

20:43.812 --> 20:45.379
A little camping accident.

20:45.447 --> 20:46.481
My buddy needs
his trailer back, pronto.

20:46.548 --> 20:47.982
He said you can help.

20:48.050 --> 20:48.916
3 grand.

20:49.918 --> 20:51.819
3 grand
will get it good as new.

20:51.887 --> 20:54.522
Oh, come on.
3 grand for a couple of dings?

20:54.590 --> 20:55.957
Hey.
Come on, Gus.

20:56.024 --> 20:57.825
What happened to the
"friends and family" discount?

20:57.893 --> 20:59.260
Can't you knock it down
to 2?

20:59.328 --> 21:02.630
Fine,
but only this once,

21:02.698 --> 21:06.000
and only because
he knows you.

21:06.068 --> 21:07.201
Yeah?

21:07.269 --> 21:08.369
Chuck.

21:08.437 --> 21:10.538
Jesse, what's up?
Uh, something wrong?

21:10.606 --> 21:12.974
Absolutely. Very much so. Listen,
I just want to let you know

21:13.041 --> 21:15.276
that I'm gonna be stopping by
the shop with a very special,

21:15.344 --> 21:18.613
very -- very well-armed
customer, all right?

21:18.680 --> 21:20.348
They want proof
we can cut and polish rocks.

21:20.415 --> 21:21.816
Just spruce the place up.

21:21.884 --> 21:24.218
Okay, what? Are you telling me
that you need a jewelry store

21:24.286 --> 21:25.786
with cutting equipment
on the fly?

21:25.854 --> 21:28.422
Yes, yes, right away.
Chuck, yes.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.625
Okay, um...
Okay, I had an ex-girlfriend.

21:30.692 --> 21:31.893
She used to
take me window-shopping

21:31.960 --> 21:34.729
at a jewelry joint downtown
on 3rd -- Felicia's.

21:34.796 --> 21:37.164
They fabricate their own stuff,
and they're a little shady,

21:37.232 --> 21:38.599
so they might give you
a way in.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.768
Just take the scenic route,
will you?

21:40.836 --> 21:42.203
Will do.

21:42.271 --> 21:43.271
Hey, Fi?
Yeah.

21:43.338 --> 21:44.505
- We should go.
- Okay.

21:44.573 --> 21:46.007
- Like right now. Yeah.
- Okay.

21:47.709 --> 21:50.144
Mind if I finish my wine before
we take our little field trip?

21:51.580 --> 21:53.548
<i>When you're operating under</i>
<i>a cover I.D.,</i>

21:53.615 --> 21:56.217
<i>it's sometimes necessary</i>
<i>to convince people in the field</i>

21:56.285 --> 21:57.885
<i>to support your operation.</i>

21:57.953 --> 21:59.320
<i>Often, it's something simple,</i>

21:59.388 --> 22:01.088
<i>like asking someone</i>
<i>at a restaurant</i>

22:01.156 --> 22:02.990
<i>if you can join them</i>
<i>for a few minutes</i>

22:03.058 --> 22:04.559
<i>while</i>
<i>you're doing surveillance.</i>

22:04.626 --> 22:06.193
Hey.
How are you doing?

22:06.261 --> 22:08.462
Hey, you're Felicia,
right, the owner?

22:08.530 --> 22:09.597
Yes.

22:09.665 --> 22:10.831
I need to
ask you a favor.

22:10.899 --> 22:12.600
Let me guess --
engagement rings.

22:14.903 --> 22:17.104
Nice try Felicia,
but really what I want

22:17.172 --> 22:18.806
is I want to
give you $2,000

22:18.874 --> 22:21.042
to borrow your store
for half an hour.

22:21.109 --> 22:23.678
<i>Some requests, however,</i>
<i>are a little more difficult.</i>

22:23.745 --> 22:26.080
No need for alarms.
We're not here to rob you.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.617
Do you know
who you're dealing with?

22:29.685 --> 22:31.953
How about, uh, ooh,
let's say $10,000

22:32.020 --> 22:34.555
for you to take
an early lunch break. Deal?

22:34.623 --> 22:36.290
No deal.
I don't know who you are

22:36.358 --> 22:38.392
or what you think you're doing,
but I'm not --

22:38.460 --> 22:41.295
Okay, look, lady. 20 grand
or bad things start happening.

22:41.363 --> 22:42.530
- Back room -- now.
- Listen, I don't --

22:42.598 --> 22:44.031
Go, go, go.

22:48.370 --> 22:50.171
Hey, boss.
How are you doing?

22:50.238 --> 22:52.740
- Who are your friends?
- Chuckie, Yash, potential business partner.

22:52.808 --> 22:54.241
Hey.

22:54.309 --> 22:56.310
So you happy, huh?

22:56.378 --> 22:59.013
This verified enough
for you?

22:59.081 --> 23:00.381
Where's
the cutting equipment?

23:01.016 --> 23:03.918
It's in the back. We're
working on something right now,

23:03.986 --> 23:06.687
but trust me,
the facility's state of the art.

23:06.755 --> 23:09.156
- May I?
- Now's not a good time.

23:10.626 --> 23:12.827
<i>The problem with relying on</i>
<i>untrained civilians</i>

23:12.894 --> 23:14.862
<i>is you never know</i>
<i>how they're gonna react</i>

23:14.930 --> 23:18.199
<i>in a life-or-death situation</i>
<i>until you're actually in one.</i>

23:18.266 --> 23:21.102
Hey, ladies. Bob.

23:21.169 --> 23:22.837
Say hi to Yash.

23:35.093 --> 23:36.948
Okay, let's go over the plan.

23:37.119 --> 23:39.253
Yash walks the two of you
into the secure room.

23:39.321 --> 23:40.988
Once he opens the safe with the
diamonds and the paper trail,

23:41.056 --> 23:41.989
that's when you subdue him.

23:42.057 --> 23:44.559
How do we do that?

23:44.626 --> 23:46.194
With this.

23:46.261 --> 23:47.862
On the outside,
ordinary fountain pen.

23:47.930 --> 23:52.300
On the inside, hypodermic needle
filled with sleepy-time juice.

23:52.367 --> 23:53.901
Once Yash
goes to dream town,

23:53.969 --> 23:56.571
you'll have all the incriminating
evidence inside that vault

23:56.638 --> 23:59.507
and you'll get out through
the east corner right there.

23:59.575 --> 24:02.710
Fi triggers the blast. We got
a brand-new door to walk out of.

24:02.778 --> 24:04.745
You up for this?

24:06.815 --> 24:08.983
Just say when.

24:10.819 --> 24:14.622
<i>Making deals with prisoners</i>
<i>in covert detention facilities</i>

24:14.690 --> 24:16.824
<i>is always a challenge.</i>

24:16.892 --> 24:19.427
<i>The problem is there's not much</i>
<i>to bargain with --</i>

24:19.494 --> 24:20.661
<i>no lawyers</i>
<i>to discuss plea deals,</i>

24:20.729 --> 24:22.997
<i>no judges</i>
<i>to reduce sentences.</i>

24:23.065 --> 24:25.433
<i>It's usually just you,</i>
<i>the prisoner,</i>

24:25.500 --> 24:27.435
<i>and a lot of razor wire.</i>

24:29.338 --> 24:30.738
What is that,
10 years old?

24:30.806 --> 24:32.440
You couldn't do better
than that?

24:32.507 --> 24:34.108
Be glad
it's not rubbing alcohol.

24:34.176 --> 24:35.476
What do you got for me,
Vaughn?

24:35.544 --> 24:37.712
This little file you found here,
Michael,

24:37.779 --> 24:39.380
it's got
some good stuff in it.

24:39.448 --> 24:41.249
You just have to
know how to read it.

24:41.316 --> 24:42.817
I can help you
with that...

24:42.884 --> 24:44.452
For a price.

24:44.519 --> 24:46.854
And what would that be?

24:46.922 --> 24:47.989
Immunity.

24:49.992 --> 24:52.059
Full immunity...
To get out of here.

24:52.127 --> 24:54.395
You know I can't do that.
I don't have the clout.

24:54.463 --> 24:56.597
You had the clout to take down
my entire organization!

24:56.665 --> 24:57.732
Sit down!

24:57.799 --> 24:59.267
Easy.

24:59.334 --> 25:00.935
Hey.

25:07.009 --> 25:09.944
I ain't got nothing
to lose.

25:10.012 --> 25:11.812
But from what I see
in those files,

25:11.880 --> 25:13.881
you do.

25:13.949 --> 25:17.218
You're a can-do boy,
Michael Westen.

25:17.286 --> 25:20.021
Show me what you can do...
For me.

25:28.797 --> 25:30.564
I don't feel good
about this, Fi.

25:30.632 --> 25:32.533
I mean, the place
is crawling with guards,

25:32.601 --> 25:34.502
and we're just gonna
let Jesse waltz in there

25:34.569 --> 25:35.703
with an untrained civilian?

25:35.771 --> 25:37.038
This is his plan,

25:37.105 --> 25:38.839
and that untrained civilian
is his best way in.

25:38.907 --> 25:40.608
Jesse knows
what he's doing.

25:40.676 --> 25:42.977
Well, guess there's
no turning back now.

25:43.045 --> 25:44.312
Clock has started.

25:44.379 --> 25:46.047
Let's do it.

25:56.191 --> 25:58.693
<i>If you need to create a doorway</i>
<i>in a concrete wall,</i>

25:58.760 --> 26:01.762
<i>a breaching frame</i>
<i>is a handy tool to bring along.</i>

26:01.830 --> 26:03.564
<i>Filled with water</i>
<i>and lined with explosives,</i>

26:03.632 --> 26:04.865
<i>it directs a charge</i>

26:04.933 --> 26:06.434
to <i>surgically cut into</i>
<i>a structure.</i>

26:06.501 --> 26:08.502
<i>Set it up properly, and</i>
<i>it will blast into a building</i>

26:08.570 --> 26:10.771
<i>faster than you can say,</i>
<i>"open sesame."</i>

26:10.839 --> 26:13.374
That didn't sound good.

26:13.442 --> 26:15.076
I think
we might have a problem.

26:15.143 --> 26:17.044
<i>Of course, if you can't</i>
<i>set it up properly,</i>

26:17.112 --> 26:19.080
<i>you might as well knock on your</i>
<i>target's front door.</i>

26:19.147 --> 26:21.415
- What the hell was that?
- Damn it!

26:21.483 --> 26:23.117
There's a reason this
wall isn't guarded --

26:23.185 --> 26:25.193
it's reinforced...
With steel if I had to guess.

26:25.194 --> 26:25.942
Okay, so?

26:25.943 --> 26:27.652
I mean, that's why we
brought the C4, right?

26:27.789 --> 26:29.623
We're gonna need more than that
to blast through steel.

26:29.691 --> 26:31.792
Then it's a good thing
that we have a lot more.

26:31.860 --> 26:34.495
We got to make a door
for those guys, and now.

26:34.563 --> 26:36.597
I can take this whole house
down, including everybody in it.

26:36.665 --> 26:37.579
I'm not gonna
take that chance.

26:37.604 --> 26:39.004
Then Jesse and Ian
are sitting ducks.

26:39.034 --> 26:42.136
We come up with a plan "B,"
or they die.

26:42.204 --> 26:44.605
There is another way
we can use the C4.

26:47.209 --> 26:49.610
Hey, easy.
Got to buy me dinner first.

26:54.182 --> 26:56.917
It's a pen, fella.
You know, for writing words.

26:57.886 --> 26:58.953
Come on.

27:01.189 --> 27:04.191
No interruptions
while we're doing business.

27:04.259 --> 27:06.293
<i>Communication in the field</i>

27:06.361 --> 27:08.229
<i>is critical</i>
<i>for a mission's success,</i>

27:08.296 --> 27:09.864
<i>but it's even more important</i>

27:09.931 --> 27:11.565
<i>when an operation's</i>
<i>going south.</i>

27:11.633 --> 27:13.200
Okay.

27:13.268 --> 27:15.369
Where's Mr. Ray?
I got to talk to him right now.

27:15.437 --> 27:18.172
- What do you think you're doing?!
- Get out of here, man.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.074
- What do you think you're doing?!
- What am I doing?!

27:20.142 --> 27:23.177
I got to talk to my boss,
and I got to talk to him now!

27:23.245 --> 27:26.280
<i>Best case, you have a secure</i>
<i>line or a system of signals</i>

27:26.348 --> 27:29.016
<i>to warn your team</i>
<i>without your enemies noticing.</i>

27:29.084 --> 27:32.153
I'm not leaving here until
I know that my boss is safe!

27:32.220 --> 27:35.890
Not another step.

27:35.957 --> 27:37.792
<i>Worst case,</i>
<i>you do whatever it takes</i>

27:37.859 --> 27:39.026
<i>to get your message across.</i>

27:39.094 --> 27:40.394
<i>If your enemies notice,</i>
<i>so be it.</i>

27:40.462 --> 27:42.563
Okay, fine,
I'll stay right here

27:42.631 --> 27:44.799
as long as you get my boss away
from mister...

27:44.866 --> 27:46.300
...What's his face.

27:46.368 --> 27:48.202
Ahluwalia!

27:50.071 --> 27:51.839
<i>So if you find yourself</i>
<i>in a situation</i>

27:51.907 --> 27:55.409
<i>where modern methods</i>
<i>of communication won't work...</i>

27:57.245 --> 27:59.647
<i>...You can always send up</i>
<i>a smoke signal.</i>

28:05.020 --> 28:06.120
What the hell?!

28:09.591 --> 28:12.493
Out! Now!

28:12.561 --> 28:14.895
Oh, my God.
You see.

28:14.963 --> 28:18.833
Look, you believe me now,
fellas?

28:18.900 --> 28:20.913
That's my car!

28:20.938 --> 28:22.338
Boss, I got here
as soon as I could.

28:22.370 --> 28:25.573
Are you okay? I think your
new partner is setting us up.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.642
- What? You're out of your mind!
- Am I?

28:28.710 --> 28:31.412
I did a sweep of our shop,
and I found a couple of bugs,

28:31.480 --> 28:33.547

listening devices

28:33.615 --> 28:35.816
that weren't there
before we did business with you.

28:39.054 --> 28:41.188
You son of a bitch.

28:41.256 --> 28:43.524
I have no idea what this man
is talking about.

28:43.592 --> 28:45.826
- What happened out here?!
- God, it just blew up.

28:45.894 --> 28:48.128
Cars just don't blow up, not
without bombs attached to them.

28:48.196 --> 28:49.396
Lock this place down.

28:49.464 --> 28:51.398
Wait, wait, wait.
What about our deal?

28:51.466 --> 28:53.200
Get out! Now!

28:53.268 --> 28:55.135
You know that Porsche
was a lease, right?

28:55.203 --> 28:57.037
Yeah, well, you still got the money.
You can buy yourself a new one.

28:57.105 --> 28:58.973
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

29:03.912 --> 29:05.170
If it makes you feel any better,

29:05.171 --> 29:07.107
I've been
over the entire operation.

29:07.108 --> 29:08.375
They had no choice
but to call it off.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.076
It was the only way
to keep you guys alive.

29:10.144 --> 29:12.179
I would have done
the same thing.

29:12.204 --> 29:13.404
Taking Yash down...

29:13.681 --> 29:15.849
It's one thing
I wanted to do.

29:18.085 --> 29:19.419
<i>Needed</i> to do.

29:19.487 --> 29:21.054
Give yourself credit
for taking a shot, you know?

29:21.122 --> 29:22.589
Most people
don't even try.

29:22.656 --> 29:24.924
This doesn't
have to be over.

29:24.992 --> 29:26.960
Ian, you said
Yash shipped everything to India

29:27.028 --> 29:28.962
after the explosion.
It's over.

29:29.030 --> 29:32.699
The evidence is gone.

29:32.767 --> 29:35.001
We can take him down
another way.

29:35.069 --> 29:37.103
We could get him busted
for murder.

29:37.171 --> 29:38.805
What are you talking about
murder? Who's he gonna kill?

29:40.307 --> 29:42.071
Me.

29:42.096 --> 29:43.616
Don't even joke like that, man.
That's not funny.

29:43.617 --> 29:46.686
Diplomatic immunity is waived
under extreme circumstances.

29:46.754 --> 29:49.455
I'd say murdering a U.S. state
department employee counts.

29:49.523 --> 29:51.157
Stop talking crazy, man.
It's not funny.

29:51.225 --> 29:53.226
No, hear me out.
Hear me out!

29:53.293 --> 29:54.961
Jesse, this was never
just about retiring

29:55.029 --> 29:56.629
with a clear conscience.

29:56.697 --> 30:00.900
I want to do one good thing
before I die.

30:03.237 --> 30:04.570
What are
you talking about?

30:06.306 --> 30:07.607
Pancreatic cancer.

30:08.876 --> 30:11.577
No fixing it.

30:11.645 --> 30:14.480
Doc says I got six months...
Maybe.

30:14.548 --> 30:15.815
You get news like that,

30:15.883 --> 30:17.750
you start thinking about
your legacy.

30:19.753 --> 30:22.555
What are people gonna say
at my funeral?

30:22.623 --> 30:24.057
I followed orders?

30:25.826 --> 30:27.627
He knew how to
give a hell of a toast?

30:29.229 --> 30:33.666
I'm checking out no matter what,
and I want to take Yash with me.

30:33.734 --> 30:36.369
We're not letting you commit
suicide to send someone to jail.

30:36.437 --> 30:38.671
Who says
you get to make that call?

30:38.739 --> 30:41.307
Do the people he's killed
have a say?

30:41.375 --> 30:43.309
Or do they not matter...

30:43.377 --> 30:45.711
'Cause they're poor,

30:45.779 --> 30:48.314
lived in places
no one's ever heard of?

30:48.382 --> 30:52.752
I'm the one
who let Yash run wild.

30:52.820 --> 30:56.022
I'm the one...

30:56.090 --> 30:59.492
Who helped him
build an empire.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.127
I'm the one...

31:01.195 --> 31:03.729
Who's gonna
do something about it.

31:03.797 --> 31:05.598
Give us time.
We'll find another way.

31:05.666 --> 31:06.766
Yeah, Ian --

31:06.834 --> 31:08.534
there isn't one.
You both know it.

31:08.602 --> 31:11.671
And I'm going for it
whether you help me or not.

31:15.509 --> 31:17.477
Look, um...

31:17.544 --> 31:19.745
If this is what you really want,
then I'm in.

31:21.515 --> 31:23.015
Mike, I don't like this
any more than you do,

31:23.083 --> 31:24.851
but if Ian's going all in,

31:24.918 --> 31:27.086
I'm gonna make sure
that it counts.

31:28.822 --> 31:30.590
You start something like this,

31:30.657 --> 31:33.292
you need to be
absolutely sure you can finish.

31:35.529 --> 31:38.364
Never been more sure
about anything in my life.

31:41.034 --> 31:43.870
All right,
I'll set it up.

31:47.674 --> 31:50.076
I have to admit,
Mr. Ray,

31:50.144 --> 31:51.444
I didn't expect
to hear from you again.

31:51.512 --> 31:54.347
Yeah, well,
I wasn't expecting to call.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.449
Something changed my mind.

31:56.517 --> 32:00.253
Found this bug
under a chair in my living room.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.388
Want to know who was sitting
in that chair two days ago?

32:03.790 --> 32:06.192
Man who's trying to kill me --
Ian Covey.

32:06.260 --> 32:07.426
There's no way.

32:07.494 --> 32:08.961
I mean, the old man
is just a bureaucrat.

32:09.029 --> 32:10.997
He's not the type of person
to overreach.

32:11.064 --> 32:12.598
You didn't think
he was the type of guy

32:12.666 --> 32:14.600
that would ask in on
a diamond deal, either, did you?

32:14.668 --> 32:17.403
Why would he blow up your car
in front of my house?

32:17.471 --> 32:18.738
Because he thought
I was gonna be in it.

32:18.805 --> 32:19.972
It was divine intervention
that I wasn't.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.608
You...

32:22.676 --> 32:25.778
I had a guy go through
what was left of my baby.

32:25.846 --> 32:27.613
He found pieces
of an explosive device

32:27.681 --> 32:29.348
wired to a timer
that malfunctioned.

32:29.416 --> 32:30.983
It was supposed to go off
a half-hour later.

32:31.051 --> 32:32.885
I would have been on the road,
on my way back to the shop.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.720
And the car -- boom.

32:34.788 --> 32:38.191
So he kills you...

32:38.258 --> 32:39.792
And then he kills me.

32:39.860 --> 32:41.661
And the diamonds,
the money,

32:41.728 --> 32:43.829
they're all
in diplomatic pouches.

32:43.897 --> 32:45.331
Who gets those when you and me
are dead?

32:45.399 --> 32:46.732
Ian.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.203
You're making some very
dangerous accusations, Mr. Ray.

32:50.270 --> 32:51.771
Look, you don't have to
believe me.

32:51.838 --> 32:53.673
Let's talk to Ian.

32:53.740 --> 32:55.374
You tell you got some documents
or something he's got to sign.

32:55.442 --> 32:56.242
He's got to some through,
right?

32:58.412 --> 33:00.346
I'll have him meet us.

33:00.414 --> 33:02.381
Yeah, yeah, let's give him
a chance to explain himself.

33:02.449 --> 33:04.217
And, hey, I want to keep
this whole thing private,

33:04.284 --> 33:05.718
you understand me?

33:05.786 --> 33:08.888
Just me, you, and Ian until
we figure out who's involved.

33:08.956 --> 33:11.123
Good afternoon, Ian.

33:11.191 --> 33:12.758
I'd like you
to come to the house.

33:12.826 --> 33:15.861
Yes,
I have some papers.

33:17.864 --> 33:21.500
<i>Simulated munitions are</i>
<i>a form of non-lethal projectile</i>

33:21.568 --> 33:23.769
<i>used mostly</i>
<i>for training purposes.</i>

33:23.837 --> 33:25.271
<i>They pack a punch,</i>

33:25.339 --> 33:27.273
<i>but they're designed</i>
<i>not to do any real damage</i>

33:27.341 --> 33:29.375
<i>beyond a welt</i>
<i>and some bruising,</i>

33:29.443 --> 33:31.944
<i>which means if they're</i>
<i>all you've got in a fire fight,</i>

33:32.012 --> 33:33.646
<i>you don't have much.</i>

33:33.714 --> 33:34.847
When you shoot Jesse,

33:34.915 --> 33:36.749
these will be enough
to burst the blood packs

33:36.817 --> 33:37.883
in his shirt.

33:37.951 --> 33:39.218
He'll collapse
and play dead

33:39.286 --> 33:40.586
until you're both
out of the room.

33:40.654 --> 33:42.989
But they won't help either
of you if you get cold feet.

33:43.056 --> 33:44.490
You still don't agree with this,
do you?

33:45.359 --> 33:47.760
Not too late
to change your mind.

33:47.828 --> 33:51.931
Nope, I'm tired of living
in a gray world.

33:51.999 --> 33:54.033
My line of work --

33:54.101 --> 33:57.670
alliances change,
priorities shift.

33:57.738 --> 34:00.373
You wouldn't believe
how easy it is

34:00.440 --> 34:03.542
to make up good reasons
for doing bad things.

34:03.610 --> 34:05.077
Sooner or later,

34:05.145 --> 34:07.380
you have to see yourself
for who you really are.

34:10.217 --> 34:13.018
Whatever.

34:13.085 --> 34:16.222
A guy like you fighting
the good fight his whole life

34:16.290 --> 34:17.556
wouldn't understand.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.259
I understand completely.

34:29.670 --> 34:32.170
I spent most of my life
as a coward.

34:32.239 --> 34:35.541
But I'm gonna die a man.

34:35.609 --> 34:36.942
Right?

34:43.784 --> 34:45.051
Relax, Mr. Ray.

34:45.118 --> 34:47.687
Relax?
Ian tried to blow me up.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.755
I don't need to relax.
You need to wake up.

34:49.822 --> 34:50.956
You thought
he was harmless.

34:51.024 --> 34:52.558
He almost took everything
from you, man.

34:52.626 --> 34:54.527
He was this close
to taking everything from you.

34:54.594 --> 34:56.462
Well, if that's true,

34:56.530 --> 34:59.098
I have men who will make sure
he pays for it dearly.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.566
What did I say
about keeping this private?

35:00.634 --> 35:02.902
Who knows what some stupid-ass
guard is gonna do. No.

35:02.969 --> 35:04.370
No, if things
get out of control,

35:04.438 --> 35:06.272
you got to
handle your own business.

35:06.340 --> 35:10.710
Believe me,
I have dealt with much worse

35:10.777 --> 35:13.379
than Ian Covey.

35:31.698 --> 35:33.733
Cops on the way?

35:33.800 --> 35:35.267
Yeah, I called in
a domestic dispute.

35:35.335 --> 35:37.069
Make sure they're close.

35:37.137 --> 35:38.671
They're gonna be right next door
when it goes down.

35:38.739 --> 35:40.439
You okay?

35:40.507 --> 35:43.909
I know.
This kind of sucks.

35:50.617 --> 35:51.884
What's going on?

35:51.952 --> 35:53.819
You tell us, Ian.

35:53.887 --> 35:56.956
We're trying to
make sense of this situation.

35:57.023 --> 35:59.759
- What situation?
- The one where Yash's buyer fell through.

35:59.826 --> 36:02.194
Right around the time
you came calling on me.

36:02.262 --> 36:04.196
That had nothing
to do with me.

36:04.264 --> 36:06.732
You must admit the timing
is peculiar, Ian.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.467
And you plugged me into
Yash's deal.

36:08.535 --> 36:09.935
But it was a setup,
wasn't it?

36:10.003 --> 36:11.637
No, that's crazy. I don't know
what you're talking --

36:11.705 --> 36:12.972
Oh, don't
play stupid, Ian.

36:13.039 --> 36:15.408
I found this in my house
underneath the chair

36:15.475 --> 36:16.809
that you
were sitting in.

36:16.877 --> 36:19.412
Can you recognize that?

36:19.479 --> 36:20.913
That's how you knew my routine
for that day.

36:20.981 --> 36:23.149
Lucky for me,
your timer didn't work.

36:23.216 --> 36:24.383
You son of a bitch.

36:24.451 --> 36:26.685
You were planning
on killing us both.

36:26.753 --> 36:28.954
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, I can explain.

36:29.022 --> 36:30.556
No, I think it's too late.
It is time --

36:38.398 --> 36:40.032
Hey!

36:49.242 --> 36:51.977
<i>Whether it's betraying their</i>
<i>country or committing a murder,</i>

36:52.045 --> 36:54.447
<i>getting someone to make</i>
<i>a life-altering mistake</i>

36:54.514 --> 36:57.383
<i>is less about logic</i>
<i>than passion.</i>

36:57.451 --> 36:59.051
<i>You have to create an</i>
<i>environment fueled by emotion,</i>

36:59.119 --> 37:01.854
<i>make them rely on instinct...</i>

37:04.858 --> 37:07.626
Stop right there,
you bastard.

37:09.029 --> 37:10.396
<i>...And make them believe</i>

37:10.464 --> 37:12.097
<i>they're in</i>
<i>a do-or-die situation.</i>

37:37.357 --> 37:38.757
I got you.

37:38.825 --> 37:41.594
What?

37:41.661 --> 37:43.762
You have something to say?

37:45.499 --> 37:46.799
I got you.

37:46.867 --> 37:49.702
Put the gun down!

37:49.769 --> 37:52.304
This isn't
what you think.

37:52.372 --> 37:53.539
I said put it down!

37:53.607 --> 37:54.907
It was self-defense.

37:54.975 --> 37:56.809
Hands behind your head!

37:56.877 --> 38:00.880
34-50 East Star. Shots fired.
10-52. One victim down.

38:00.947 --> 38:03.048
I am telling you,
it was self-defense!

38:03.116 --> 38:04.149
He has a gun!

38:05.685 --> 38:08.754
He's dead,
and I don't see any gun.

38:08.822 --> 38:10.956
He -- he -- he shot a man
inside my house.

38:11.024 --> 38:14.226
Go inside and look! There is
a dead man in my office!

38:14.294 --> 38:16.161
Go inside and see!

38:23.470 --> 38:28.173
Hey. You okay, man?

38:28.241 --> 38:29.842
Got to give Ian credit,
you know?

38:29.910 --> 38:32.945
Not a lot of people get a chance
to go out on their own terms.

38:35.181 --> 38:39.151
Well, that's our cue.
We got to get.

38:41.054 --> 38:42.154
Mike, you coming?

38:44.691 --> 38:47.760
Mike?
We got to go.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.535
I want you to know

39:06.536 --> 39:08.637
that I almost turned around
three times on the way here.

39:11.541 --> 39:14.676
This file set some very serious
balls rolling, Michael.

39:14.744 --> 39:16.245
If we pull the trigger, and the
orders in there go through --

39:16.312 --> 39:18.013
- I'm hoping it won't come to that.
- Good.

39:18.081 --> 39:23.152
Just understand...I put myself
on the line in a big way here.

39:23.219 --> 39:24.353
I think it's time I hear
what's going on.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.057
When we were looking
for the people who burned me,

39:29.125 --> 39:31.193
even when we thought
we had them all,

39:31.261 --> 39:32.728
I had doubts.

39:32.795 --> 39:35.330
I wasn't sure it was all over,
and I was right.

39:35.398 --> 39:37.266
You're serious?

39:37.333 --> 39:39.201
You have hard evidence
that the people --

39:39.269 --> 39:41.803
Dani, the last person
I told my suspicion to was Max,

39:41.871 --> 39:44.439
and he died in my arms.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.708
I don't want that
to happen to you.

39:46.776 --> 39:50.312
So, please,
don't press this any further.

39:52.015 --> 39:53.682
What if I want to help?

39:56.052 --> 39:57.819
When it comes to that,
if it comes to that,

39:57.887 --> 40:01.089
I will tell you, but for now,
I need to do this alone.

40:03.660 --> 40:04.993
Good luck.

40:11.467 --> 40:12.768
You got
my immunity agreement?

40:14.537 --> 40:15.971
I used every trick
I could,

40:16.039 --> 40:18.240
but I just couldn't
get you immunity, Vaughn.

40:18.308 --> 40:20.909
Then we have
nothing to talk about.

40:20.977 --> 40:24.313
Don't be like that.
I got you a consolation prize.

40:32.488 --> 40:34.223
You got me transferred
out of Guantanamo?

40:34.290 --> 40:35.757
No, no, no, no.
That's not good enough.

40:35.825 --> 40:38.293
I figured you'd say that,
but I did it anyway.

40:38.361 --> 40:39.828
And since
I know how difficult it is

40:39.896 --> 40:41.930
for you to make new friends
without blackmailing them,

40:41.998 --> 40:46.134
I decided to have a few of your
old friends transferred here

40:46.202 --> 40:47.603
to keep you company.

40:47.670 --> 40:51.773
You remember this guy, Belgian
assassin who worked for you.

40:51.841 --> 40:54.643
Vincen-- Vincent something.
Oh, of course you do.

40:54.711 --> 40:57.112
You ratted him out
to reduce your sentence.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.815
Oh, and...

40:59.882 --> 41:02.517
You remember this guy.
You tried to have him killed.

41:04.354 --> 41:05.721
Simon.

41:05.788 --> 41:08.156
Now I know you guys
had a falling out,

41:08.224 --> 41:10.158
but you guys have 25 years
to patch things up,

41:10.226 --> 41:12.227
25 years to roam free...

41:12.295 --> 41:14.463
In the exercise yard
of a federal prison.

41:14.530 --> 41:17.766
Just you
and your old pals.

41:19.335 --> 41:20.869
You're welcome.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.372
Hey, Michael.
Michael, look.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.207
Look, look.
Michael, you can't do this.

41:25.275 --> 41:28.176
No, I really can,
but I don't have to

41:28.244 --> 41:31.246
if you give me something,
Vaughn!

41:31.314 --> 41:33.315
Now, you read the files.

41:33.383 --> 41:36.151
What is Anson planning?
Is he trying to disappear?

41:36.219 --> 41:37.819
What is his play here?

41:37.887 --> 41:39.221
Look, those numbers,

41:39.289 --> 41:41.723
they're not just bank accounts
and blind trusts.

41:41.791 --> 41:42.691
They're linked
to real things.

41:42.759 --> 41:44.259
What things?

41:44.327 --> 41:47.429
Our organization, it wasn't
just run on burn spies.

41:47.497 --> 41:49.164
We had an infrastructure.

41:49.232 --> 41:51.333
We had transport companies
and supply depots.

41:51.401 --> 41:53.068
Weapons manufacturers,
legit businesses,

41:53.136 --> 41:54.936
all set up
to serve our purposes.

41:55.004 --> 41:57.272
Without them in place,
we would not exist!

41:57.340 --> 41:59.241
What does this have to do
with Anson?

41:59.309 --> 42:02.678
Michael, you really
don't see it, do you?

42:02.745 --> 42:04.680
Anson isn't retiring.

42:04.747 --> 42:07.316
He's rebuilding.

42:07.383 --> 42:09.318
The organization
that burned you,

42:09.385 --> 42:11.153
he's bringing that back
online.

42:13.089 --> 42:13.855
No.

42:13.923 --> 42:16.291
You can try and stop it.

42:16.359 --> 42:20.095
But if I know Anson,
it may already be too late.

42:28.571 --> 42:30.605
Westen!
We had a deal!

42:30.673 --> 42:33.608
Westen, look. You got to
cancel those transfers.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.911
I don't know, Vaughn.
It just might be too late.
