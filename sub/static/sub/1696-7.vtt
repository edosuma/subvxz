00:08.744 --> 00:10.974
This is so cool!

00:11.046 --> 00:13.640
I've been waiting months
for these scarves to come out!

00:13.715 --> 00:16.081
- I'm never taking it off!
- Great!

00:16.151 --> 00:20.554
Just be sure to shower in cold water
only and lie yourself flat to dry.

00:21.723 --> 00:23.122
Okay, next!

00:24.226 --> 00:25.921
Not so fast, short stuff.

00:25.994 --> 00:28.326
You know the drill. Arms out.

00:31.233 --> 00:33.758
I knew it! What you hiding in there?

00:34.570 --> 00:37.664
- Braces?
- Yeah, likely story. Open!

00:39.975 --> 00:41.374
Daddy, you know I love Roxy.

00:41.443 --> 00:43.934
She's the best bodyguard
we've ever had,

00:44.012 --> 00:47.311
but ever since she got back
from her Marine Corps reunion,

00:47.382 --> 00:49.009
- she's been a little...
- Say "ah!"

00:49.084 --> 00:50.210
Ahhh.

00:51.053 --> 00:52.611
In your face.

00:52.688 --> 00:54.417
She's just looking out for you, darling.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.821
Remember, Roxy's the same person
that threw herself

00:56.892 --> 00:59.952
in between you and that
sneezing fan in Cleveland.

01:00.028 --> 01:01.188
You're right.

01:01.263 --> 01:04.664
All right, she's clean.
Doesn't floss, but she's clean.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.394
Move along. Hey!

01:07.102 --> 01:09.400
But I got my eyes on you.

01:13.308 --> 01:17.506
Oh, my, that looks fabulous on you!

01:17.579 --> 01:19.274
Actually, I'm just looking.

01:19.348 --> 01:23.409
Well, then look some place else, kid,
I've got a car payment to make.

01:23.485 --> 01:27.216
Fine. But I hope when
I'm as old as you, I'm not as bitter.

01:27.823 --> 01:29.518
Oh, you will be.

01:32.060 --> 01:33.288
This is incredible.

01:33.362 --> 01:36.160
All these fans, and the store
even made a mannequin of me.

01:36.231 --> 01:40.099
That's not a mannequin, that's
a Hannequin, Miss Montanaquin.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.226
Oh, no.

01:41.303 --> 01:43.066
What? That was cute-aquin.

01:43.138 --> 01:46.539
No, I think my dad's shopping
for my birthday present.

01:46.608 --> 01:50.601
Oh, no, someone's gonna buy you
something really expensive and cool.

01:50.679 --> 01:52.408
Whatever will you do?

01:52.481 --> 01:54.244
No, Lilly, you don't get it.

01:54.316 --> 01:56.807
As a dad, he knows everything
about everything.

01:56.885 --> 01:58.580
But as a shopper,

01:58.654 --> 02:03.353
well, let's just say the alarm should
go off when he comes into the store.

02:03.425 --> 02:04.892
You're right. All that dress needs

02:04.960 --> 02:07.724
is a sheep and a bonnet
and you're Little Bo Geek.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.957
I love him, but the man should
not be allowed

02:10.032 --> 02:12.933
into the teen department
with a credit card.

02:14.736 --> 02:17.296
Will someone
please stop him?

02:17.372 --> 02:18.862
Stop who? Where? I'll get him!

02:23.645 --> 02:25.169
He's clean!

02:25.247 --> 02:27.977
Move along.
You're blocking people here!

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Learn the unknown English words

<i> Come on!</i>

02:37.759 --> 02:40.557
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:41.897 --> 02:45.458
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:45.534 --> 02:49.163
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>

02:49.237 --> 02:53.537
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:54.276 --> 02:57.541
<i>Who would have thought</i>

02:57.612 --> 03:02.879
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:02.951 --> 03:06.978
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:07.055 --> 03:08.886
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:08.957 --> 03:10.686
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:10.759 --> 03:15.162
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:16.631 --> 03:20.032
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:26.508 --> 03:28.840
Mom always knew
the right stuff to buy me.

03:28.910 --> 03:31.105
She had great taste.

03:31.179 --> 03:32.237
But Dad...

03:32.314 --> 03:35.511
Oh, man, he has the taste
of a month-old pickle.

03:36.284 --> 03:39.185
Look, no dad knows
how to shop for a girl.

03:39.254 --> 03:42.018
You know what my dad got me
for my last birthday?

03:42.090 --> 03:43.580
A savings bond.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.855
You can touch it, you can feel it,
but you can't spend it!

03:46.928 --> 03:48.293
Pointless!

03:48.363 --> 03:52.732
Well, I'd take a savings bond
over one of these presents any day.

03:52.801 --> 03:54.098
Behold,

03:54.636 --> 03:58.299
the ghosts of holidays past.

03:59.374 --> 04:03.140
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I need a fashion magazine!

04:05.147 --> 04:08.116
Cool, hip, trendy...

04:08.183 --> 04:10.276
Okay, all better.

04:10.952 --> 04:13.250
I can't believe you
actually wore those in public.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.414
Please.
They never made it out of the house.

04:16.158 --> 04:19.491
Miley! Let's see that
pretty new birthday number.

04:24.933 --> 04:27.561
Daddy! Does tomato juice stain?

04:32.407 --> 04:34.272
Mamma mia!

04:34.342 --> 04:36.674
Thatsa bigga staina!

04:38.680 --> 04:40.614
Why don't you just say
something to him?

04:40.682 --> 04:42.912
Because I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

04:42.984 --> 04:46.215
You should see the look on his face
when he gives them to me and says,

04:46.288 --> 04:49.223
"I picked this out special for you, bud. "

04:49.291 --> 04:51.191
Oh, the puppy dog look.

04:51.259 --> 04:53.921
My dad gets me to shampoo
grandma with that one.

04:55.664 --> 04:57.996
Well, you know, I don't think I can
take another one of those looks

04:58.066 --> 05:00.125
or another one of his presents.

05:00.202 --> 05:03.763
There's gotta be a way to stop him
from shopping again.

05:03.839 --> 05:04.863
Well, what are you gonna do?

05:04.940 --> 05:08.341
It's not like he's gonna
take you along with him.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.934
True,

05:10.011 --> 05:11.911
but he might take you.

05:11.980 --> 05:15.313
Excuse me! If I can squeeze through
that air vent, so can someone else.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.374
We're gonna work on that.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.291
Miley? Miles?

05:26.928 --> 05:28.862
All right, the coast is clear,
bring in the cake.

05:28.930 --> 05:30.158
Whoa! Whoa!

05:30.232 --> 05:31.893
Hey, hey.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.261
Woop! Woop! Woop!

05:33.335 --> 05:35.599
Would you give... Give it to me!

05:36.705 --> 05:39.265
Dude, chill, I'm just playing with you.
It's just a cake.

05:39.341 --> 05:42.572
It's not just a cake,
it's Miley's birthday cake.

05:42.644 --> 05:44.009
And it's a chance for me
to prove to my dad

05:44.079 --> 05:46.673
that I can do something around
here without screwing it up.

05:46.748 --> 05:48.443
Dude, I can help you bring in the cake,

05:48.517 --> 05:51.714
but I cannot help you
with mission impossible.

05:52.554 --> 05:53.987
I got it here, didn't I?

05:54.055 --> 05:56.922
Good, still perfect.

05:56.992 --> 05:59.722
And it's gonna stay perfect
until Miley's birthday tomorrow.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.955
I just gotta get it in the garage fridge.

06:02.030 --> 06:03.930
Oh, could you grab the box?

06:03.999 --> 06:08.766
I can't wait to see the look on my Dad's
face when he gets a load of this cake.

06:13.542 --> 06:17.672
Son, I don't think you wanna
see the look on my face.

06:19.414 --> 06:21.541
What are you grinning about?

06:29.057 --> 06:33.323
There he is. Now just remember
my future happiness depends on you.

06:34.095 --> 06:35.426
No pressure.

06:35.497 --> 06:39.558
You know, usually when someone says
"no pressure" it adds pressure.

06:39.634 --> 06:41.033
Just go!

06:43.972 --> 06:47.203
- Mr. Stewart!
- Hey, Lilly.

06:47.275 --> 06:49.869
What on earth are you doing here?

06:49.945 --> 06:53.813
Oh, I'm still hunting for just that right
birthday present for my little girl.

06:53.882 --> 06:56.680
What a coinkydink. So am I.

06:57.452 --> 07:00.785
So, found anything?

07:02.524 --> 07:03.582
Nope.

07:03.658 --> 07:06.593
Well, here's a wacky thought,
maybe I can help you out,

07:06.661 --> 07:10.654
since we both happen to be
coinkidinkally here. Coinkidinkally.

07:11.366 --> 07:13.266
That's not a bad idea.

07:13.835 --> 07:15.530
What do you think of this little number?

07:15.604 --> 07:17.231
What do I think of that?

07:17.305 --> 07:19.830
Hmm. What do I think?

07:21.776 --> 07:24.210
I'm gonna have to give it
a thumbs down.

07:24.279 --> 07:26.577
What about something over here?

07:33.888 --> 07:34.912
Hi.

07:36.658 --> 07:37.784
Hi.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.993
Just looking.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.129
Me again.

07:49.004 --> 07:51.996
Just wanted to let you know
about our new promotion.

07:52.073 --> 07:54.940
Yeah, it's called buy something
or get out.

07:56.278 --> 07:57.939
Hey, I have my eye on something.

07:58.013 --> 08:01.574
Blah, blah, blah, and don't come back.

08:09.157 --> 08:11.625
I don't know.
Maybe we should just try another store.

08:11.693 --> 08:13.456
No! We haven't checked
everywhere yet.

08:13.528 --> 08:18.192
I'm sure we can find her somewhere,
I mean find her something somewhere.

08:26.107 --> 08:27.267
Lilly.

08:30.812 --> 08:31.836
Whoa!

08:31.913 --> 08:34.313
What? Did you find something?

08:34.381 --> 08:35.679
Sure did.

08:40.221 --> 08:41.745
And I hate it.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.050
Just thought I'd let you know.

08:45.126 --> 08:46.559
Look, pink.

08:55.704 --> 08:57.262
Let go.

09:00.875 --> 09:04.936
You know, I think I saw something
with a big bow on it over here.

09:07.549 --> 09:10.575
Hey, that's nice. Where'd you find that?

09:10.652 --> 09:14.349
It just sort of jumped out at me
and hit me in the eye!

09:14.422 --> 09:15.889
You think she'd like it?

09:15.957 --> 09:18.983
I think if she were here,
she'd be all over it.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.687
Then let's do it.

09:24.132 --> 09:26.498
Man, that thing is lifelike.

09:26.568 --> 09:28.297
I mean they even got the freckles right.

09:28.370 --> 09:30.736
Look! No one at register two.

09:36.978 --> 09:40.436
- Hey, cut it out!
- Mommy!

09:42.984 --> 09:44.178
Don't be scared.

09:44.252 --> 09:46.482
Stop staring at me, you freak!

09:47.455 --> 09:49.446
Kid thought I was real.

09:58.066 --> 10:00.330
Come on, there's a spare key
out here somewhere.

10:00.402 --> 10:02.267
Okay, first you drop a cake,

10:02.337 --> 10:05.101
then you lock yourself outside
of the house with the new cake.

10:05.173 --> 10:08.506
I'm starting to think
you got some cake issues.

10:08.576 --> 10:11.272
Less thinky, more looky. All right.

10:11.946 --> 10:14.437
If anything happens to this one,
my Dad will never let me live it down.

10:15.650 --> 10:18.210
Please tell me the cake didn't just fall.

10:18.286 --> 10:21.517
The cake didn't just fall.
The pelicans pushed it.

10:26.895 --> 10:28.419
Why?

10:28.963 --> 10:31.431
Maybe they thought it was a crab cake.

10:31.499 --> 10:34.991
Oh, you get it? Crab cake.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.002
Go home.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.443
Hold up there.

10:48.516 --> 10:50.006
Has this bag been out of your sight

10:50.084 --> 10:52.882
or control since the time
you wrapped it?

10:54.088 --> 10:56.318
Roxy, you're here for Miley's birthday.

10:56.391 --> 10:58.291
You're a guest, you're off the clock.

10:58.359 --> 11:01.419
Mmm-mmm.
Danger never takes a vacation.

11:02.664 --> 11:05.565
All clear, and, girl, you're gonna love it!

11:08.970 --> 11:11.598
Lilly, this is awesome.

11:12.874 --> 11:15.104
And it's gonna look so good
with the jacket.

11:15.176 --> 11:16.939
I know.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.808
- Here you go, Mile.
- One second.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.609
Oh, Roxy. I got this one.

11:20.682 --> 11:23.173
And I'll use your present to do it.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.354
It's clean.

11:29.023 --> 11:32.686
I told you she was gonna love it.
Ooh! You've been working out.

11:34.362 --> 11:35.886
Yeah, I have.

11:39.033 --> 11:40.864
Sheepskin seat covers.

11:40.935 --> 11:43.426
You got me a present for your car?

11:43.505 --> 11:47.669
Hey, when I drive you to the mall,
I want you to be comfortable.

11:47.742 --> 11:50.643
For Christmas,
I'm getting you chrome spinners.

11:50.712 --> 11:53.408
Fine. And you're getting a black
leather skirt with matching pumps.

11:53.481 --> 11:55.142
Mess with me!

11:56.885 --> 12:00.981
Your turn, Mr. Stewart.
I wonder what you got her. Wink, wink.

12:01.055 --> 12:02.613
Happy birthday, bud.

12:02.690 --> 12:03.850
I have no idea what this is,

12:03.925 --> 12:05.256
but that's the great thing
about surprises,

12:05.326 --> 12:07.692
you don't know what it is and...

12:10.632 --> 12:12.532
Oh, it's a kitty!

12:14.636 --> 12:17.127
- But what about the jacket?
- I took it back.

12:17.205 --> 12:19.264
Didn't feel right.

12:19.340 --> 12:22.104
I picked it out special for you, bud.

12:22.176 --> 12:25.236
And I love it! Especially the back.

12:27.982 --> 12:30.883
Do I know my little girl, or what?

12:30.952 --> 12:33.477
Turn it around! Squeeze the nose!

12:37.258 --> 12:40.318
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any cuter.

12:49.938 --> 12:53.203
Okay, I'll wear it for an hour.
Make my dad happy.

12:53.274 --> 12:57.404
And then tonight, it will mysteriously
fall into the barbeque.

12:59.347 --> 13:01.474
What if it doesn't burn?

13:02.417 --> 13:05.443
I will cut it up and eat it if I have to.

13:06.554 --> 13:08.784
Either way, no one besides you,
me and my daddy

13:08.856 --> 13:11.381
is ever gonna see me in this thing.

13:12.060 --> 13:16.121
Hey, Mile, come on out on
the deck. I got another surprise for you.

13:16.197 --> 13:19.564
If it's the matching pants,
you're eating it with me.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.232
Surprise!

13:32.847 --> 13:35.281
- Got you, didn't I?
- You sure did.

13:36.017 --> 13:37.575
Okay, what we waiting on?

13:37.652 --> 13:41.588
Everybody down to the beach!
We've got a birthday to celebrate!

13:42.256 --> 13:44.850
You don't know how hard it was
to keep the secret from both of you.

13:44.926 --> 13:46.359
You knew?

13:46.427 --> 13:49.692
Yeah. You should've seen
the look on your face.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.597
How do you like this look?

13:54.769 --> 13:58.500
Wow, that's the same look
my mom had when she turned 40.

13:58.573 --> 14:00.165
Well, what are you waiting on, darling?

14:00.241 --> 14:03.210
Get on down there
and show off that sweater.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.141
Are you sure it won't make
the other kids jealous?

14:06.214 --> 14:08.444
Because you know, it might.

14:08.850 --> 14:10.750
Honey, this is your special day.

14:10.818 --> 14:13.946
You deserve to have
every eye down there on you.

14:15.223 --> 14:16.417
Great.

14:19.093 --> 14:21.288
Jackson, we're gonna need
that cake in about an hour.

14:21.362 --> 14:24.798
Yeah, no problem.
Why should it be a problem?

14:28.036 --> 14:32.473
You're laughing at me, aren't you?
Laughing your little pelican laugh.

14:32.540 --> 14:33.973
I hate you!

14:40.882 --> 14:44.010
Okay, everybody, it's limbo time!

14:44.619 --> 14:48.555
Yeah, how low can you go?
How low can you go?

14:48.623 --> 14:49.681
How low can you... Oh!

14:50.925 --> 14:53.860
My achy breaky back!

14:57.632 --> 14:58.929
Hey, Roxy, have you seen...

14:59.000 --> 15:01.195
Miley!

15:01.269 --> 15:04.363
Sorry. Never sneak up behind Roxy.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.371
Roxy sees everything.

15:10.545 --> 15:13.343
Hey, you're all right there, sugar.
Shake it off.

15:14.182 --> 15:16.616
Come on, Miley.
So it's a dorky sweater.

15:16.684 --> 15:19.619
Are you kidding?
I look like a kitty-kabob.

15:21.055 --> 15:23.182
Well, no one here's
gonna make fun of you.

15:23.257 --> 15:24.884
It's not like someone's
gonna take your picture

15:24.959 --> 15:26.756
and put it in the school yearbook.

15:26.828 --> 15:28.056
Hey, birthday girl!

15:28.129 --> 15:29.687
Say, "Cheese!"

15:31.432 --> 15:33.662
Quick! Cover my tail!

15:34.702 --> 15:37.102
- Did you get her?
- No. You?

15:37.171 --> 15:40.140
No. I took a picture of myself
by mistake.

15:41.309 --> 15:43.209
And I look fantastic.

15:48.082 --> 15:50.744
Yo, J-man! Jackson!

15:50.818 --> 15:53.651
- In the kitchen, Coop!
- Yo!

15:53.721 --> 15:57.020
Did you see the road kill
your sister was wearing?

15:59.293 --> 16:00.692
What are you doing?

16:00.762 --> 16:03.253
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm baking the cake.

16:03.331 --> 16:08.735
All right, I got milk, flour.
Now add three eggs. All right.

16:09.937 --> 16:11.529
One, two, three.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.902
- Jackson...
- Shh.

16:13.975 --> 16:15.772
Now, stir. All right.

16:17.445 --> 16:19.037
Stupid pelicans.

16:19.981 --> 16:23.212
Pelicans eat fish, not cake!
Everybody knows that.

16:24.585 --> 16:27.520
Coop, I think there's
something wrong here.

16:27.622 --> 16:30.386
You're supposed to break
the eggs, fool!

16:30.992 --> 16:33.051
That totally makes sense.

16:34.128 --> 16:35.720
Yeah, thank you.

16:36.964 --> 16:38.795
I cannot watch this anymore.

16:38.866 --> 16:41.391
- Like you could do any better?
- Way better.

16:41.469 --> 16:44.927
Okay, I'm going to tell you something
nobody outside my family knows.

16:45.006 --> 16:47.065
What? You still drink Shirley Temples?

16:47.141 --> 16:49.439
They are fruity and refreshing!

16:51.279 --> 16:53.804
But that's not it! The truth is...

16:54.482 --> 16:55.744
I'm a baker.

16:55.817 --> 16:57.842
- What?
- I love to bake!

16:57.919 --> 16:59.819
Pies, cakes, tarts

16:59.887 --> 17:02.651
and my snickerdoodles
are off the chain!

17:03.558 --> 17:05.048
You said that your mom made those.

17:05.126 --> 17:07.788
Are you kidding?
My mom can't make ice.

17:09.163 --> 17:11.393
Now step off and let a pro have a go.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.059
I need a clean bowl,
fresh ingredients and...

17:14.135 --> 17:17.229
Give me that.
You're not fit to hold the whisk!

17:18.906 --> 17:21.772
Ya mon, that's right.
Nobody can beat this.

17:23.477 --> 17:28.608
Guess again, string bean.
Roxy is undefeated. How low can I go?

17:28.683 --> 17:29.809
Yes!

17:33.754 --> 17:36.882
Now somebody point me
to the prize table.

17:36.958 --> 17:38.220
But you cheated.

17:38.292 --> 17:40.624
- I don't think so.
- Neither do I.

17:42.897 --> 17:44.364
Here, kitty kitty kitty.

17:44.432 --> 17:47.868
Miley, you can't stay
in the bathroom forever.

17:48.336 --> 17:51.328
You know the best part about
being yearbook editor?

17:51.405 --> 17:53.965
- Choosing the pictures that go in it.
- Choosing the pictures that go in it.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.030
Ooh!

17:57.144 --> 17:59.112
- I'm getting tired of that.
- Me, too.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.171
- Let's stop.
- Let's stop.

18:01.716 --> 18:02.705
Ooh!

18:06.120 --> 18:08.953
- Why don't you just take it off?
- And tell my father what?

18:09.023 --> 18:11.992
I don't know,
that you're allergic to cats?

18:13.027 --> 18:15.461
This is what I think of that idea.

18:18.799 --> 18:20.130
But you gotta do something.

18:20.201 --> 18:24.001
If they take your picture,
it'll be in the yearbook forever.

18:25.072 --> 18:26.767
Hey, it's Oliver.

18:26.841 --> 18:28.468
Use the other one!

18:28.542 --> 18:30.635
Miley, you can come out now.
I got you covered.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.077
- How?
- Just trust me.

18:36.017 --> 18:37.951
Here, this should cover the sweater.

18:38.019 --> 18:39.543
Oliver, you're a lifesaver.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.088
My Aunt Harriet got me the
puppy version for Christmas.

18:42.156 --> 18:44.147
It barks <i> Jingle Bells. </i>

18:45.326 --> 18:46.384
Very clever.

18:46.460 --> 18:49.793
Yeah, there's no way
we can take that picture now.

18:49.864 --> 18:53.322
Right. Unless something
were to happen like this.

18:55.069 --> 18:56.093
Stop it, guys!

18:56.170 --> 18:58.468
- Yeah, why are you so mean?
- It's what we do.

18:58.539 --> 19:00.439
- Well, we don't.
- Yeah, we're her friends.

19:00.508 --> 19:02.908
You think everybody here doesn't
know it's the dorkiest sweater

19:02.977 --> 19:04.069
in the history of the world?

19:04.145 --> 19:06.909
You'd have to be blind not to see that.

19:11.252 --> 19:14.187
Well, I don't care what
anybody thinks. I...

19:14.722 --> 19:16.087
I love this sweater.

19:16.157 --> 19:19.092
Because it was given to me
by someone I care about very much.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.720
And if you wanna take my picture,
then go right ahead.

19:21.796 --> 19:23.195
Because this sweater
means more to me

19:23.264 --> 19:25.562
than the coolest outfit in the world.

19:25.633 --> 19:26.861
Right, Mittens?

19:31.672 --> 19:34.698
Wow. It really makes you think
twice about taking the picture.

19:34.775 --> 19:36.367
I know.

19:36.444 --> 19:37.706
- Say cheese.
- Say cheese.

19:38.913 --> 19:40.505
Hey, girls! Picture this!

19:53.561 --> 19:55.028
Yeah, that's what happens
when you mess with

19:55.096 --> 19:57.690
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Roxy.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.332
My cake!

20:01.268 --> 20:03.759
That I carried but didn't make.

20:04.405 --> 20:06.600
Because guys don't do that.

20:06.674 --> 20:08.539
Ladies. Say, "Gotcha!"

20:09.744 --> 20:11.268
Now we both have pictures.

20:11.412 --> 20:13.004
- Wanna trade?
- Wanna trade?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.069
Ooh!

20:14.248 --> 20:15.840
I don't do that.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.387
- Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

20:29.030 --> 20:30.497
Thanks for a great birthday.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.863
Yeah, thanks for what
you said out there. But...

20:33.934 --> 20:36.061
We both know I messed up, don't we?

20:36.137 --> 20:37.764
It's not that...

20:38.706 --> 20:40.640
I wouldn't say...

20:41.742 --> 20:43.505
It meows, Dad.

20:44.779 --> 20:46.007
I know.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.840
I saw a lot of clothes
you would've liked a lot more,

20:48.916 --> 20:51.407
but I just couldn't
get myself to buy them.

20:51.485 --> 20:53.476
Why not?
You see what I wear to school.

20:53.554 --> 20:55.852
You see what I wear on stage
as Hannah Montana.

20:55.923 --> 20:58.585
Yeah. Maybe that's just it.

20:58.659 --> 21:01.560
My little girl's just growing up so fast,
there's a part of me

21:01.629 --> 21:04.564
that just wanted to hold on
to the little girl you used to be.

21:04.632 --> 21:07.897
Daddy, I'll always be your little girl.

21:07.968 --> 21:11.301
I'll just be your little girl
that dresses better.

21:11.372 --> 21:12.964
It's a deal.

21:13.040 --> 21:16.066
You know, your mom and I,
when she was around,

21:16.143 --> 21:17.633
we used to have a deal that

21:17.711 --> 21:20.805
she'd buy all the presents
and I'd carry the bags for her.

21:20.881 --> 21:23.475
Maybe it's time I just started
carrying your bags for you.

21:23.551 --> 21:26.384
- That could work.
- But you gotta do me one favor.

21:26.454 --> 21:30.015
When you open your presents,
you still gotta act surprised.

21:30.091 --> 21:31.649
That's perfect.

21:33.694 --> 21:34.820
Hey.

21:35.696 --> 21:38.597
Does that pelican
got frosting on his beak?

21:41.268 --> 21:42.633
Jackson.

22:03.357 --> 22:06.087
How long do you think
that's gonna last?

22:07.394 --> 22:09.555
It's got a watch battery.

22:09.630 --> 22:11.564
It could last forever.

22:15.369 --> 22:16.927
One more time!

22:17.305 --> 22:23.820
