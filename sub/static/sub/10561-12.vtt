00:57.189 --> 00:59.034
- Garland Resid...
- It's Dr. Ogden.

00:59.103 --> 01:01.775
Tell Dr. Garland I will
come by at 6 o'clock.

01:02.182 --> 01:05.911
Chill some champagne. Take
the rest of the day off.

01:06.549 --> 01:08.952
Hardly a please or a thank you.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.161
- Dr. Garland?
- Yes.

01:18.217 --> 01:20.157
Dr. Ogden telephoned.

01:20.277 --> 01:22.746
She wishes to visit this evening.

01:25.093 --> 01:26.507
I see.

01:26.713 --> 01:29.028
And she said I should take the night off.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.624
And that you should chill some champagne.

01:32.901 --> 01:34.534
Then you should.

01:35.172 --> 01:37.399
And I should buy some champagne.

01:38.381 --> 01:41.076
- Let yourself out.
- Of course.

02:00.462 --> 02:02.458
Hello, Dr. Ogden.

02:08.115 --> 02:09.948
What cheek.

02:20.751 --> 02:22.053
What are you doing, sir?

02:22.328 --> 02:24.455
Making elastic bands, George.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.045
Easily purchased, sir.

02:27.934 --> 02:31.375
Why spend hard-earned money on
something you can easily make yourself?

02:31.863 --> 02:34.409
So frugality is the
mother of invention, then?

02:34.822 --> 02:37.098
A gunshot was reported from
a house on Jarvis Street.

02:37.099 --> 02:39.282
- A neighbour telephoned it in.
- What's the address?

02:39.332 --> 02:40.465
693.

02:41.122 --> 02:42.424
What was that?

02:43.093 --> 02:44.394
693.

02:44.570 --> 02:45.603
693...

02:46.610 --> 02:48.317
that's Darcy Garland's house.

03:11.394 --> 03:15.016
- What can you tell me, Dr.?
- The shooting happened quite recently.

03:16.076 --> 03:17.500
The body is still warm.

03:17.620 --> 03:18.445
Right.

03:19.821 --> 03:22.381
Take him to the morgue, and
please, be discrete about it.

03:22.450 --> 03:23.400
Of course.

03:24.282 --> 03:25.152
Sir.

03:26.163 --> 03:27.748
- Murder weapon, George?
- No, sir.

03:27.799 --> 03:30.301
And I've checked all the doors and
windows, there's no sign of forced entry.

03:30.421 --> 03:32.891
- You've checked them all?
- All of them, sir. Twice.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.587
Dr. Garland invited his
killer into his home.

03:36.429 --> 03:37.820
And we've brought in the housekeeper, sir,

03:37.821 --> 03:39.116
Miss Miriam Weller.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.058
- She wasn't here?
- She said she was dismissed early.

03:43.469 --> 03:44.572
By Dr. Garland?

03:44.747 --> 03:45.930
By Dr. Ogden.

03:46.538 --> 03:47.424
I beg your pardon?

03:47.425 --> 03:49.822
Sir, she said she received a
telephone call from Dr. Ogden

03:49.840 --> 03:52.199
relieving her of her duties
for the rest of the day.

03:55.143 --> 03:57.865
Hello, I'm Detective Murdoch
of the Toronto Const...

03:57.859 --> 03:59.589
I know very well who you are, sir.

04:02.026 --> 04:04.547
I understand you received a
telephone call from Dr. Ogden?

04:04.609 --> 04:05.410
I did.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.537
- What time was this?
- Two o'clock.

04:08.175 --> 04:09.877
Dr. Garland was just about to leave

04:09.896 --> 04:11.516
for an afternoon appointment.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.595
And you're quite sure it was Dr. Ogden?

04:15.527 --> 04:18.228
I do know the sound of
my mistress's voice, sir.

04:18.942 --> 04:21.610
As I am sure you do as well.

04:24.005 --> 04:26.676
Do you know if Dr. Garland
owned a gun, by chance?

04:26.701 --> 04:27.446
He did.

04:30.285 --> 04:31.832
He was American, you know.

04:32.876 --> 04:35.760
It's a .45 revolver, I believe.

04:36.424 --> 04:37.831
A family heirloom.

04:37.838 --> 04:39.315
He was quite proud of it.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.692
Please, don't touch it, Mrs. Weller.

04:43.365 --> 04:44.295
Thank you.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.030
The Lord always takes the wrong ones.

04:56.007 --> 04:57.114
Sir?

04:57.296 --> 04:58.297
What is it, George?

04:58.647 --> 04:59.767
Apparently a neighbour

04:59.786 --> 05:02.006
saw Dr. Ogden pull up in a carriage.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.753
Was this before or after the shooting?

05:06.010 --> 05:07.349
Before.

05:12.116 --> 05:13.286
Murdoch.

05:18.204 --> 05:19.975
- Sir.
- Anything?

05:20.025 --> 05:21.044
Nothing yet.

05:22.984 --> 05:24.248
Something on your mind?

05:24.748 --> 05:26.168
Have you talked to Dr. Ogden yet?

05:26.538 --> 05:27.163
No.

05:27.789 --> 05:29.678
We need to confirm her whereabouts.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.381
Yes, of course.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.859
But nothing about this, sir.

05:35.178 --> 05:37.005
I need to be the one to tell her.

05:45.449 --> 05:47.720
Dr. Ogden left sometime this afternoon.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.622
And when is she due to return, Doctor?

05:49.742 --> 05:51.393
Later this evening, I would imagine.

05:51.513 --> 05:52.670
And where is she?

05:52.851 --> 05:53.720
Markham.

05:53.983 --> 05:56.386
She was undertaking an
admittance evaluation

05:56.430 --> 05:59.414
of a Mrs. Wilhelmina Broughton.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.154
No one was more surprised

06:04.150 --> 06:05.727
than myself to see her.

06:07.854 --> 06:10.500
Are you sure it was Dr. Ogden, Mrs. Smythe?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.313
Of course it was her.

06:12.602 --> 06:13.966
How far away were you?

06:14.086 --> 06:15.843
She walked right past me.

06:16.162 --> 06:17.657
Did she speak to you?

06:17.883 --> 06:19.854
- Engage you in any way?
- No.

06:19.897 --> 06:22.018
She marched straight up into the house.

06:22.913 --> 06:26.527
I have to admit I was rather curious.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.770
I was aware of their marital discord.

06:30.565 --> 06:32.499
Apparently, she'd been running around

06:32.518 --> 06:34.157
with some Catholic,

06:34.551 --> 06:36.178
if you can imagine.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.258
I believe Dr. Garland was killed

06:42.259 --> 06:45.944
sometime between 5:55 p.m. and 6:05 p.m.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.996
- Thank you, Doctor.
- And the weapon?

06:49.116 --> 06:51.368
A single shot from a .45 revolver.

06:51.862 --> 06:53.176
We've yet to recover it.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.216
Dr. Garland owned such a weapon.

06:56.210 --> 06:59.332
Is it true Dr. Ogden was
seen just outside the house?

06:59.382 --> 07:00.408
She was.

07:01.584 --> 07:02.976
But you don't suspect...

07:02.992 --> 07:04.080
Of course not.

07:06.439 --> 07:08.179
Perhaps it was a mistake.

07:08.435 --> 07:10.318
Dr. Ogden wasn't the only woman

07:10.312 --> 07:12.051
in Dr. Garland's life.

07:13.365 --> 07:16.299
When did you last see Dr.
Garland, Miss Shropshire?

07:16.419 --> 07:17.870
This afternoon.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.248
Dr. Garland was expecting a visit

07:20.254 --> 07:21.862
from his wife this evening.

07:23.548 --> 07:25.046
We had a disagreement about it.

07:25.378 --> 07:26.479
Oh, you did, did you?

07:28.237 --> 07:30.120
I felt it improper.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.305
Did you also feel jealousy?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.552
I am not a stupid woman, Detective,

07:35.583 --> 07:37.216
and I resent the insinuation.

07:37.336 --> 07:40.526
Then you will have no problem
verifying your whereabouts this evening.

07:41.552 --> 07:43.354
I most certainly won't.

07:43.934 --> 07:46.125
I was at the Women's
Christian Reading Society.

07:46.138 --> 07:48.059
At least 10 women can vouch for me.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.976
Your Dr. Ogden

07:53.009 --> 07:55.742
requested a visit with Darcy
and then she killed him.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.883
Thank you for your opinion.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.227
The press are going to
find out soon enough.

08:05.347 --> 08:06.340
I know.

08:06.847 --> 08:09.137
And I doubt the witnesses
are going to keep quiet.

08:09.387 --> 08:11.183
And no sign of Julia.

08:12.128 --> 08:13.868
Sir, in the eyes of the world,

08:13.906 --> 08:15.876
she is the number one
suspect at the moment.

08:16.631 --> 08:18.824
Until she comes home and clears her story.

08:25.193 --> 08:26.995
George, what have you?

08:27.020 --> 08:30.104
Sirs, I spoke to Wilhelmina
Broughton's family up in Markham.

08:30.117 --> 08:31.850
They've never heard of Dr. Ogden.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.373
Where are you off to, Murdoch?

08:35.561 --> 08:36.687
To find Julia.

08:36.705 --> 08:39.025
Sir, surely you don't think
she had anything to do with...

08:39.027 --> 08:41.129
Two witnesses place Julia
at the scene of the crime

08:41.148 --> 08:42.669
shortly before the murder.

08:43.038 --> 08:45.647
We need to prove that their
recollections are wrong.

09:12.913 --> 09:15.916
William, what a nice surprise.

09:18.455 --> 09:20.153
Julia, I need to speak with you.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.744
Is everything all right?

09:30.267 --> 09:31.745
Murdered?

09:33.228 --> 09:35.230
My God!

09:36.105 --> 09:37.720
When did this happen?

09:38.001 --> 09:39.778
While you were out of town.

09:42.511 --> 09:44.358
I don't believe it.

09:44.948 --> 09:46.692
Who would kill Darcy?

09:48.982 --> 09:51.153
You were in Markham,

09:51.220 --> 09:52.136
I understand.

09:53.856 --> 09:55.958
Markham, yes. I...

09:56.340 --> 09:58.167
I was assessing a patient.

10:00.770 --> 10:02.440
- Julia...
- William, I...

10:02.560 --> 10:05.825
I'm sorry, but I need to
contact Darcy's parents.

10:08.034 --> 10:09.302
Julia...

10:09.370 --> 10:11.851
William, please, I need to do this.

10:20.715 --> 10:22.455
A telephone call.

10:22.636 --> 10:23.894
And an eyewitness.

10:25.295 --> 10:26.246
Nothing definitive.

10:26.366 --> 10:28.705
Oh, I've secured convictions with less.

10:29.656 --> 10:30.945
And I see there's no confirmation

10:30.951 --> 10:33.016
as to where Dr. Ogden claims to have been.

10:33.136 --> 10:34.986
We're attempting to ascertain that now.

10:35.106 --> 10:36.413
She didn't tell you?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.565
You have spoken to her haven't you?

10:38.959 --> 10:40.849
- I have.
- What did she say?

10:41.517 --> 10:44.390
That she was out of town
at the time of the murder.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.087
Chief Constable Giles,

10:46.121 --> 10:47.926
it is unimaginable that Dr. Ogden

10:47.939 --> 10:50.585
could have anything to do
with the death of her husband.

10:51.204 --> 10:53.582
Detective Murdoch, you're
relieved from this case.

10:53.702 --> 10:56.003
- Sir?
- You are too close to the suspect.

10:56.253 --> 10:59.432
- The suspect.
- I think it's best that I see this through.

11:00.539 --> 11:03.124
- I object to this.
- Murdoch, stand down.

11:03.186 --> 11:04.769
Thank you, Inspector.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.036
You as well, sir?

11:09.593 --> 11:11.207
You're not being relieved of your duties,

11:11.226 --> 11:12.584
just the reins of this case.

11:12.609 --> 11:13.816
You don't understand.

11:13.810 --> 11:16.807
Giles will pursue one
suspect and one suspect alone

11:16.826 --> 11:18.377
until he gets a conviction.

11:18.390 --> 11:20.186
Julia doesn't stand a chance.

11:25.422 --> 11:29.627
Dr. Julia Ogden telephoned the
Garland housekeeper at two o'clock,

11:29.652 --> 11:31.285
giving her the evening off.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.199
At four o'clock, Abigail Smythe,

11:33.212 --> 11:36.709
a neighbour, witnessed Dr. Ogden
entering the Garland residence.

11:36.829 --> 11:41.051
At 6:05 a call reporting shots fired
was received by this station house

11:41.058 --> 11:43.498
and the police arrived
on the scene at 6:15.

11:44.124 --> 11:46.194
Constable Crabtree, does
this station have a record

11:46.195 --> 11:47.778
of Dr. Ogden's fingermarks?

11:47.898 --> 11:49.498
- Sir, yes.
- Good.

11:49.618 --> 11:52.120
Jackson, you'll do a full
dusting of the Garland house.

11:52.364 --> 11:53.853
Sir, with all due respect,

11:53.909 --> 11:55.879
of course Dr. Ogden's
fingermarks will be found.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.758
- She's visited previously.
- Constable Crabtree,

11:58.808 --> 12:00.347
you and Constable Higgins

12:00.360 --> 12:03.895
will conduct a thorough
search of Dr. Ogden's house.

12:04.095 --> 12:06.272
Interior and exterior.

12:06.328 --> 12:07.642
We are looking for the murder weapon,

12:07.673 --> 12:10.458
and any other evidence
pertaining to the case.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.605
Well, that's all.

12:13.655 --> 12:15.695
- Sir.
- Yes.

12:21.576 --> 12:23.934
His parents want to bury him in Buffalo.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.448
Understandably.

12:25.568 --> 12:27.507
- I'll need to facilitate getting his body...
- Julia,

12:28.207 --> 12:31.079
I need you to tell me where
you were when Darcy was killed.

12:31.311 --> 12:32.249
I did.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.333
I need you to tell me the truth.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.296
You were never in Markham.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.668
- You investigated me?
- I had to.

12:38.788 --> 12:40.690
An eyewitness placed you at Darcy's house

12:40.696 --> 12:42.298
at the time that he was murdered.

12:42.473 --> 12:44.932
That's impossible, William.
I've told you I was never there.

12:44.919 --> 12:46.927
Well, then could you please
tell me where you were?

12:46.952 --> 12:49.073
And it would be most helpful
if you could provide me

12:49.079 --> 12:51.012
with someone who could verify this.

12:51.894 --> 12:54.710
Julia, this is becoming serious.

12:55.379 --> 12:57.901
Does Chief Constable
Giles genuinely believe

12:57.913 --> 12:59.321
I had something to do with this?

13:01.091 --> 13:02.687
He does!

13:04.558 --> 13:07.649
- I was escorting a woman to Port Credit.
- Who?

13:08.281 --> 13:10.183
Her name is Penelope Irwin.

13:10.303 --> 13:13.643
It was my considered opinion that
she was being driven mad with fear.

13:13.818 --> 13:16.014
- How?
- Her husband vowed to kill her.

13:16.039 --> 13:17.854
I had to get her away from him.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.937
I need to speak with her then.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.703
Well, only if I go with you.
I won't be persuaded otherwise.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.092
Fine.

13:25.724 --> 13:28.464
Julia, why did you not
tell me of this earlier?

13:29.196 --> 13:32.212
The smaller the circle, the
easier it is to conceal the lie.

13:32.399 --> 13:34.164
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.

13:36.754 --> 13:39.093
There is a two o'clock train
leaving for Port Credit.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.008
I'll meet you at the station in two hours.

13:42.309 --> 13:43.566
Fine.

13:47.045 --> 13:49.428
Julia, when we last spoke of Darcy,

13:49.441 --> 13:51.850
you said you would handle it.

13:55.128 --> 13:57.555
I won't dignify that with a response.

13:57.805 --> 13:59.339
Honestly, William.

14:01.072 --> 14:04.100
I had my lawyer contact his.

14:14.906 --> 14:16.933
You don't think she could
have done it, do you?

14:17.352 --> 14:18.785
Of course not, Henry.

14:18.905 --> 14:20.818
Dr. Ogden is a good woman.

14:21.406 --> 14:24.309
I've seen good people turn
into murderers before, George.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.850
Well, Dr. Ogden is not one of them.

14:34.463 --> 14:35.909
George.

14:40.175 --> 14:42.565
Have you ever seen Dr.
Ogden wear this dress?

14:43.479 --> 14:47.252
- Many women wear green dresses, sir.
- With or without the blood?

14:48.785 --> 14:50.755
I want you to walk the route

14:50.787 --> 14:52.319
from Dr. Garland's

14:52.651 --> 14:54.687
to Dr. Ogden's house.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.470
I want you to look in every
shrub, and under every stone.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.878
We need to find the murder weapon.

15:01.679 --> 15:03.512
Yes, sir.

15:13.924 --> 15:15.513
What can I do for you, Chief Constable?

15:15.532 --> 15:18.054
A full forensic
investigation of this garment.

15:18.079 --> 15:20.831
I need you to confirm that the
blood on this dress is human.

15:21.007 --> 15:21.732
Of course.

15:21.745 --> 15:24.510
Now Dr. Grace, I'm aware of
your association with Dr. Ogden,

15:24.542 --> 15:26.794
and that you regard her
as something of a mentor.

15:27.876 --> 15:28.990
Are you insinuating...?

15:29.002 --> 15:31.655
I expect you to do an honest job,

15:31.775 --> 15:33.782
regardless of the suspect.

15:35.816 --> 15:37.279
Of course.

15:38.724 --> 15:40.770
There is one good bit of
news for Detective Murdoch.

15:40.890 --> 15:41.803
What's that?

15:41.853 --> 15:44.393
It's easier for him to marry
a widow than a divorcée.

15:44.687 --> 15:47.328
Henry, that's not funny.

15:52.927 --> 15:54.122
What is it, George?

15:54.698 --> 15:56.257
Give me a boost, Henry.

16:03.782 --> 16:05.215
All right.

16:08.106 --> 16:10.840
Constable Crabtree.

16:12.329 --> 16:15.326
- Sir.
- A report on your status.

16:15.551 --> 16:18.979
- Still investigating, sir.
- And have you found out anything of interest?

16:19.361 --> 16:20.368
Not yet.

16:20.488 --> 16:22.833
And you think that something
might just fall into your lap

16:22.858 --> 16:25.273
if you continue to sit at your desk?

16:26.650 --> 16:28.064
Detective...

16:32.688 --> 16:34.734
You need to test it for fingermarks.

16:34.854 --> 16:37.211
- Sir, what if I find...
- We need to know.

16:38.350 --> 16:39.852
And if I get the wrong answer?

16:40.027 --> 16:41.961
There's no right or wrong
answer in this, George.

16:41.998 --> 16:43.237
Only the truth.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.871
What have you found, Doctor?

16:54.855 --> 16:56.288
The blood is human.

16:57.139 --> 16:58.672
Your eyes betray you.

16:58.872 --> 17:02.069
But there is no way I can determine
whether this is Dr. Garland's blood,

17:02.275 --> 17:03.945
so it is hardly conclusive evidence.

17:04.001 --> 17:07.161
So now you're a Detective as well, Doctor?

17:11.931 --> 17:14.114
You've been officially
removed from this case.

17:14.152 --> 17:16.435
Then I'm on an unofficial
trip to Port Credit.

17:16.623 --> 17:18.700
I have to prove her alibi. And quickly.

17:19.169 --> 17:21.195
Murdoch, you're on thin ice as it is.

17:21.616 --> 17:23.555
Do you believe this woman Irwin exists?

17:23.675 --> 17:24.731
I do.

17:26.358 --> 17:29.249
I won't be able to keep your
absence unnoticed for very long.

17:30.069 --> 17:32.252
Tell Giles I'm speaking to my priest.

17:32.315 --> 17:35.037
He seems to think that's
all we Catholics do.

17:38.275 --> 17:40.023
Dr. Grace.

17:42.338 --> 17:43.915
Dr. Ogden.

17:44.428 --> 17:45.879
What a surprise.

17:46.516 --> 17:47.788
What can I do for you?

17:48.184 --> 17:50.835
I was hoping to take
a look at Darcy's body.

17:51.588 --> 17:54.269
It's at MacAllroy's. Being prepared.

17:57.427 --> 17:59.042
May I look at your report?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.049
I see. I'm a suspect.

18:06.081 --> 18:08.120
If you really want it, I could...

18:08.577 --> 18:09.803
It's all right,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.955
I'm sure you did a thorough examination.

18:15.058 --> 18:17.623
Julia, I'm so sorry.

18:19.049 --> 18:21.277
He was such a good man, Emily.

18:22.016 --> 18:23.855
He didn't deserve this.

18:24.218 --> 18:26.914
I'm sure the real culprit
will soon be found.

18:28.510 --> 18:30.362
Thank you for that.

18:33.472 --> 18:35.856
- Constable Crabtree.
- Dr. Ogden.

18:37.030 --> 18:38.671
Nice to see a friendly face.

18:39.032 --> 18:40.347
Doctor, I'm...

18:40.467 --> 18:42.581
I'm so sorry for your loss.

18:44.735 --> 18:46.055
As am I.

18:58.315 --> 19:01.025
I'm to test this for fingermarks.

19:04.478 --> 19:06.249
I have to admit

19:07.625 --> 19:10.441
I'm apprehensive as to what I might find.

19:17.535 --> 19:19.056
Sir!

19:20.163 --> 19:21.146
Sir!

19:21.266 --> 19:23.067
What have you, George? I'm
due at the train station.

19:23.073 --> 19:24.687
Sir, it's what I don't have.

19:24.756 --> 19:27.027
Fingermarks. The weapon is clean.

19:27.578 --> 19:29.743
Oh, that's very good, very good.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.914
But not conclusive of her innocence.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.447
Anyone could surmise that she had
the sense to wipe down the gun.

19:34.448 --> 19:35.105
Right.

19:35.111 --> 19:36.513
What do I do with the gun now?

19:37.026 --> 19:38.733
Give it to the Chief Constable.

19:38.853 --> 19:39.816
And give him your results.

19:39.841 --> 19:41.086
Sir. Thank you.

19:41.123 --> 19:42.456
Godspeed, sir.

19:50.579 --> 19:53.294
My friend is in Paris for the World's Fair.

19:53.538 --> 19:56.153
She let me use the house.

19:56.585 --> 19:59.056
I knew that Penelope
would be out of harm's way.

20:03.847 --> 20:05.092
Penelope?

20:06.406 --> 20:07.557
Hello?

20:10.385 --> 20:12.800
- Mrs. Irwin?
- Penelope?

20:17.637 --> 20:19.120
I don't think she's here.

20:19.677 --> 20:23.005
In fact, there's no
indication she ever was.

20:23.497 --> 20:24.782
This is terrible, William.

20:24.988 --> 20:26.734
Her husband must have found her.

20:27.234 --> 20:29.124
How would he know where she was?

20:29.335 --> 20:31.633
He must have followed Penelope and me.

20:31.670 --> 20:33.366
William, you have to do something.

20:33.417 --> 20:34.249
Julia,

20:34.906 --> 20:37.866
I think you need to start
worrying about yourself.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.399
We need to find someone
who can verify your story.

20:41.238 --> 20:43.984
- My "story"?
- You know what I mean.

20:45.274 --> 20:46.306
I need you to tell me

20:46.318 --> 20:48.302
everything you know
about this Penelope Irwin.

20:49.084 --> 20:50.924
Her husband's name is Desmond Irwin.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.689
He worked at the Copeland
Brewery on Parliament.

21:00.422 --> 21:01.665
George?

21:01.732 --> 21:03.306
Sir. Doctor.

21:03.619 --> 21:04.351
Uh,

21:04.471 --> 21:06.077
Doctor, Chief Constable Giles

21:06.078 --> 21:07.854
wants me to escort you to the station.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.287
He... he just wants to speak to you.

21:10.174 --> 21:11.533
Of course.

21:11.884 --> 21:13.868
Be very careful what you say.

21:13.988 --> 21:16.039
William, I haven't done anything wrong!

21:39.850 --> 21:42.721
That is the weapon that
killed your husband.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.305
Are my fingermarks on it?

21:45.625 --> 21:46.857
You were a coroner,

21:46.891 --> 21:48.534
I wouldn't expect them to be.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.420
You think I did it?

21:52.996 --> 21:55.331
You think I would shoot my husband?

21:55.399 --> 21:57.213
What I think doesn't matter.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.283
What matters are the facts.

21:59.403 --> 22:00.697
And the evidence.

22:01.123 --> 22:03.650
And there is plenty to suggest
that you entered the home

22:03.675 --> 22:06.491
of your estranged husband
last night and shot him dead.

22:07.366 --> 22:10.100
- I wasn't even in the city.
- Then where were you?

22:12.083 --> 22:13.673
I prefer not to say.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.751
Dr. Ogden,

22:16.818 --> 22:18.146
I have to be honest.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.199
With the preponderance of evidence,

22:20.236 --> 22:22.476
I am looking at you as our primary suspect.

22:24.816 --> 22:26.592
I didn't do it.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.338
And if that's true,

22:28.369 --> 22:30.596
you have very little to worry about.

22:31.422 --> 22:32.899
I must say it's a surprise

22:32.905 --> 22:35.339
not to see you wearing widow's black.

22:37.066 --> 22:39.268
How very modern.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.384
Detective William Murdoch.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.792
Toronto Constabulary.

22:46.912 --> 22:49.426
I'm looking for a Desmond
Irwin. Where might I find him?

22:50.150 --> 22:52.016
Your guess is as good as mine.

22:52.352 --> 22:54.043
Never heard of him.

22:54.519 --> 22:56.302
I was told he worked here.

22:56.352 --> 22:59.449
I've been here ten years.
I've never had a Desmond Irwin.

22:59.724 --> 23:01.838
Somebody's pulling your leg.

23:04.741 --> 23:05.636
Sir.

23:06.467 --> 23:09.940
Sir, I've checked every
record I could think of, birth,

23:10.060 --> 23:12.536
marriage, tax. At every station.

23:13.406 --> 23:16.197
I'm afraid this Desmond
Irwin doesn't exist.

23:17.385 --> 23:19.331
Sir!

23:21.415 --> 23:24.637
George, I need to see that murder weapon.

23:26.351 --> 23:29.305
Sir, Dr. Ogden's fingermarks are not
on the weapon. I checked it thoroughly.

23:29.337 --> 23:31.332
George, I need to see that gun.

23:31.608 --> 23:33.815
Sir, if the Chief Constable found out...

23:34.216 --> 23:37.527
Keep us informed of your
whereabouts, Dr. Ogden.

23:43.551 --> 23:45.701
I'll get you the weapon, sir.

24:37.181 --> 24:38.470
Where is it?

24:38.945 --> 24:40.416
Constable Crabtree?!

24:43.081 --> 24:44.482
Where's the gun?

24:45.990 --> 24:47.278
Sir, I don't know.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.437
- I must have misplaced it.
- Misplaced?

24:49.737 --> 24:51.983
Look, I know playing daft
is second nature to you,

24:52.003 --> 24:53.129
but unless you get me that gun

24:53.135 --> 24:56.088
you will find yourself behind bars for
interfering with a criminal investigation.

24:56.107 --> 24:58.672
- Chief Constable, I don't know...
- Here it is, sir.

25:00.139 --> 25:02.464
I took it without Constable
Crabtree's knowledge.

25:02.477 --> 25:03.540
He had nothing to do with this.

25:03.590 --> 25:05.317
Why would you do such a thing?

25:06.255 --> 25:07.231
I wanted to check

25:07.219 --> 25:09.215
the bullet casing for fingermarks.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.772
And did you find any?

25:11.548 --> 25:12.261
Yes.

25:12.551 --> 25:13.737
Whose were they?

25:14.970 --> 25:16.621
Dr. Ogden's.

25:18.223 --> 25:20.419
Good work, Detective.

25:27.188 --> 25:29.584
- You present a compelling case.
- Thank you, sir.

25:30.535 --> 25:32.925
This is a terrible
tragedy. I knew Dr. Garland.

25:32.919 --> 25:34.045
He was an upstanding citizen. A

25:34.114 --> 25:36.929
nd I've known Dr. Ogden since
I've been at this station.

25:37.317 --> 25:38.981
She's brought more guilty men

25:38.994 --> 25:40.014
to justice than most of my constables.

25:40.052 --> 25:41.879
Then it was shoddy work on her part

25:41.892 --> 25:44.044
that she didn't better conceal her actions.

25:45.151 --> 25:47.248
Well, I'll present your findings

25:47.254 --> 25:48.750
to the Attorney General, gentlemen,

25:48.781 --> 25:51.420
but I can see no reason why
this should not go to trial.

25:51.540 --> 25:52.384
You're making a mistake.

25:52.378 --> 25:53.785
Inspector Brackenreid?

25:54.310 --> 25:56.212
I know there's an explanation for this.

25:56.332 --> 25:58.026
Dr. Ogden is a good woman.

25:58.326 --> 26:00.010
Perhaps it was a case of self-defense.

26:00.372 --> 26:02.725
Then she shall have her
day in court to prove it.

26:02.931 --> 26:03.851
Good day.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.239
Detective Murdoch,

26:11.359 --> 26:13.591
I was unaware that you'd
been invited to this meeting.

26:13.623 --> 26:16.544
- Sir, I believe you're being premature.
- Oh, do you now?

26:16.557 --> 26:19.672
I have yet to track down the person
that can provide Dr. Ogden's alibi.

26:19.691 --> 26:21.899
With a bit more time...
Did I not remove you

26:21.912 --> 26:23.426
from this investigation?

26:23.714 --> 26:26.035
And yet you have
persisted in being involved

26:26.023 --> 26:27.606
despite my orders.

26:27.726 --> 26:29.627
Sir, you are condemning Dr. Ogden

26:29.640 --> 26:32.217
because of a personal
grudge you hold against me.

26:32.267 --> 26:34.801
Detective Murdoch, go home.

26:34.921 --> 26:37.786
You are suspended from the
Constabulary until further notice.

26:37.967 --> 26:39.269
If this is about the past,

26:39.281 --> 26:41.649
- I.E. Constance Gardiner...
- This is about

26:41.690 --> 26:44.867
the here and now. And another
word from you, Inspector,

26:44.886 --> 26:46.894
- and you can join him.
- You jumped-up bastard.

26:46.925 --> 26:47.407
Sir!

26:47.441 --> 26:49.756
I've just about had enough of
you walking around my station

26:49.791 --> 26:52.193
- like some bloody little Napoleon.
- As you wish,

26:52.230 --> 26:54.545
Brackenreid. I'll have your badge as well.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.637
You didn't need to do that, sir.

26:59.706 --> 27:01.708
Don't tell me what I need to do.

27:02.396 --> 27:04.091
Well, it's much appreciated.

27:11.850 --> 27:12.833
Julia.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.794
- Did you find her?
- No.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.177
What about her husband?

27:19.401 --> 27:22.238
Julia, the Irwins do not exist.

27:22.306 --> 27:23.843
What are you saying?

27:26.358 --> 27:28.761
I'm meeting Darcy's parents
at the train station.

27:28.755 --> 27:30.463
How would it look if I wasn't wearing it?

27:30.500 --> 27:32.377
Julia, I need you to be honest with me.

27:32.497 --> 27:33.585
I am.

27:34.260 --> 27:37.170
Your fingermark was found
on the bullet casing.

27:37.496 --> 27:38.268
What?

27:38.297 --> 27:41.557
Julia, did you ever have
occasion to load Darcy's gun?

27:41.775 --> 27:44.165
- No.
- Are you sure?

27:45.595 --> 27:46.949
My God...

27:48.657 --> 27:51.203
Julia, you have to go.

27:51.433 --> 27:55.176
- Go? Where?
- Anywhere. Out of town for a few days.

27:55.170 --> 27:56.628
I'll follow along shortly.

27:56.879 --> 27:59.550
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Julia, you are being stubborn!

27:59.742 --> 28:02.297
Giles has the bit in his mouth
and you could hang for this.

28:02.316 --> 28:04.350
- Now, you have to go!
- Murdoch!

28:04.470 --> 28:05.657
Step aside.

28:07.409 --> 28:09.123
Dr. Julia Ogden, I'm arresting you

28:09.129 --> 28:10.868
for the murder of Dr. Darcy Garland.

28:11.087 --> 28:12.351
Take her away.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.678
Gentlemen, Dr. Julia Ogden

28:32.798 --> 28:35.751
is a woman used to taking what she wants.

28:36.189 --> 28:38.481
She was carrying on a sordid affair,

28:38.520 --> 28:41.148
one well-documented by hotel records,

28:41.268 --> 28:43.221
with a certain William Murdoch,

28:43.479 --> 28:46.887
a Catholic detective employed
by the Toronto Constabulary.

28:46.888 --> 28:50.165
A man who, as recently as
one month ago, was involved

28:50.478 --> 28:53.184
in a physical altercation with Dr. Garland.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.038
Now, together, the two of them

28:55.158 --> 28:58.800
were doing everything in
their power to goad Dr. Garland

28:59.128 --> 29:01.247
into granting her a divorce.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.649
He did not.

29:04.079 --> 29:08.028
And so, he was shot and killed.

29:09.255 --> 29:11.210
Now, gentlemen,

29:11.330 --> 29:13.697
we have a witness

29:13.817 --> 29:16.192
to Dr. Ogden's visit before the shooting.

29:16.654 --> 29:19.915
We have blood found on a
dress belonging to Dr. Ogden,

29:20.142 --> 29:22.409
and most damning of all, gentlemen,

29:22.425 --> 29:24.857
the bullet used to kill Dr. Garland

29:25.233 --> 29:28.181
had Dr. Ogden's fingermarks on it.

29:30.722 --> 29:34.296
Mrs. Weller, would you kindly
recount the events leading up

29:34.335 --> 29:35.977
to Dr. Garland's death?

29:36.322 --> 29:39.044
I received a telephone call from Dr. Ogden.

29:39.164 --> 29:42.008
The accused. And what did she request?

29:42.211 --> 29:44.041
That I leave for the evening

29:44.072 --> 29:46.223
and chill a bottle of champagne.

29:46.343 --> 29:49.023
And what was Dr. Garland's reaction?

29:49.143 --> 29:50.571
He was pleased.

29:50.626 --> 29:53.605
I think he was hoping that it
might lead to a reconciliation.

29:53.652 --> 29:57.038
Objection, Your Honour. Speculation
on the part of the witness.

29:57.078 --> 30:00.221
I agree. The jury will ignore the comment.

30:00.823 --> 30:02.990
You're sure it was her voice?

30:03.110 --> 30:04.632
I'd worked for her.

30:04.752 --> 30:06.305
Of course I'm certain.

30:06.845 --> 30:08.433
The voice was halting,

30:08.553 --> 30:10.450
but it was definitely hers.

30:11.021 --> 30:13.086
He was a lovely man.

30:13.618 --> 30:14.978
She, on the other hand...

30:15.033 --> 30:18.153
Please, Mrs. Smythe, let us
stick to the day in question.

30:18.273 --> 30:20.969
She came flouncing into the house.

30:21.089 --> 30:22.319
I saw her.

30:22.439 --> 30:24.300
And you're sure it was her?

30:24.420 --> 30:27.679
She was as close to me as I am to you.

30:28.031 --> 30:31.886
Tell me, what happened when you
inquired as to Dr. Ogden's whereabouts?

30:32.339 --> 30:35.343
I was told she was in
Markham visiting a patient.

30:35.463 --> 30:39.018
She in fact had signed a ledger
to that effect, had she not?

30:39.138 --> 30:40.668
Yes.

30:40.788 --> 30:43.554
And was she? In Markham?

30:44.678 --> 30:46.291
- No.
- No.

30:46.411 --> 30:47.488
So she lied.

30:47.511 --> 30:49.889
- Well, she had to. She was...
- Yes or no, Inspector.

30:49.904 --> 30:52.133
Did she lie about her alibi?

30:54.104 --> 30:55.692
Yes.

30:57.654 --> 30:59.922
I was asked by Chief Constable Giles

30:59.953 --> 31:02.886
to determine whether the
blood on the dress was human.

31:02.933 --> 31:04.763
And this is possible?

31:04.883 --> 31:07.289
First, one has to isolate
an individual blood cell.

31:07.336 --> 31:10.512
- One does this by...
- A simple yes or no will suffice.

31:10.981 --> 31:12.944
Was the blood human?

31:13.507 --> 31:15.149
The blood was human.

31:15.642 --> 31:17.573
Had you ever seen Dr. Ogden

31:17.605 --> 31:19.708
wearing this same green dress?

31:21.789 --> 31:24.346
I have no way of knowing
it was the same dress.

31:24.377 --> 31:27.185
Well, did Dr. Ogden own
a dress exactly like it?

31:27.208 --> 31:28.053
Your Honour,

31:28.045 --> 31:30.462
how is Dr. Grace to know
the detailed contents

31:30.470 --> 31:32.136
of Dr. Ogden's wardrobe?

31:32.159 --> 31:34.560
I am going to allow the question.

31:36.257 --> 31:38.799
Yes, she does.

31:38.919 --> 31:40.833
The Crown would like to remind the jury

31:40.872 --> 31:44.352
that the eyewitness reported seeing
the accused wearing a green dress

31:44.472 --> 31:46.468
when she entered the Garland household.

31:48.680 --> 31:49.888
Constable Crabtree,

31:49.919 --> 31:51.696
you discovered the murder
weapon, did you not?

31:52.672 --> 31:53.417
I did.

31:53.442 --> 31:54.999
And did you test for fingermarks?

31:55.025 --> 31:55.719
Yes.

31:56.188 --> 31:58.741
Because fingermarks are
considered indisputable evidence.

31:59.448 --> 32:01.882
- I don't know if I would say that...
- But precedent does,

32:01.901 --> 32:03.239
- does it not?
- Your Honour,

32:03.308 --> 32:05.754
this man is a simple police Constable.

32:05.816 --> 32:09.677
And more educated in these
matters than you or I.

32:10.522 --> 32:11.992
Tell me, did you search

32:12.112 --> 32:13.719
the weapon for fingermarks?

32:13.839 --> 32:14.689
Yes.

32:15.258 --> 32:17.060
- And did you find any?
- I did not.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.275
But there were fingermarks on
the bullet casing, were there not?

32:20.738 --> 32:22.327
- A thumb-mark, yes.
- A thumb-mark?

32:22.384 --> 32:24.492
And who found that?

32:24.999 --> 32:26.357
Detective Murdoch.

32:26.744 --> 32:28.328
Detective Murdoch?

32:28.835 --> 32:31.107
It was my understanding
that Detective Murdoch

32:31.125 --> 32:32.395
had been dismissed from the case.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.209
How would he obtain a piece of evidence?

32:34.535 --> 32:35.636
I gave it to him.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.450
Why?

32:37.901 --> 32:39.339
Because he asked.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.179
Tell me, Constable,

32:41.366 --> 32:42.993
would you have granted his request

32:43.025 --> 32:45.358
had he not been involved
in a personal relationship

32:45.390 --> 32:46.860
- with the accused?
- Your Honour!

32:46.860 --> 32:48.049
Mr. Gordon...

32:48.074 --> 32:49.312
That's quite all right, Your Honour.

32:49.637 --> 32:51.120
I don't require an answer.

32:54.168 --> 32:57.934
Detective Murdoch, you are a world-renowned
expert on fingermarks, are you not?

32:58.297 --> 33:00.574
I am an expert, yes.

33:00.694 --> 33:03.014
So you can confirm Dr. Ogden's thumb-mark

33:03.039 --> 33:05.672
on the casing of the bullet
that killed Dr. Garland.

33:07.474 --> 33:08.319
Yes.

33:08.369 --> 33:10.859
From where she pushed the
bullet into the chamber.

33:12.311 --> 33:13.437
Yes.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.153
What made you think to look there?

33:16.203 --> 33:16.960
Have you...

33:17.279 --> 33:19.531
discovered thumb-marks
on a cartridge before?

33:19.588 --> 33:20.495
I have.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.886
Do you love the accused, Detective?

33:23.917 --> 33:26.169
Your Honour, this has no relevance.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.966
I'm going to allow the question.

33:32.338 --> 33:33.990
Yes, I love her.

33:34.110 --> 33:34.741
Huh.

33:35.028 --> 33:36.749
Why then, did you go out of your way

33:36.768 --> 33:39.471
to discover a key piece
of evidence against her?

33:40.178 --> 33:41.992
I was hoping to exonerate her.

33:43.413 --> 33:44.708
Tell me, were you alone

33:44.828 --> 33:46.985
when you looked for the thumb-mark?

33:47.798 --> 33:48.931
Yes.

33:49.344 --> 33:50.458
Why?

33:50.796 --> 33:52.679
Why, when you were so confident

33:52.679 --> 33:53.968
of her innocence?

33:54.230 --> 33:56.057
Why make Constable Crabtree

33:56.045 --> 33:58.378
violate the rules and bring you the weapon?

33:59.511 --> 34:01.401
I submit, Detective,

34:01.582 --> 34:04.123
that you looked for those
fingermarks because you were terrified

34:04.141 --> 34:05.837
someone else would before you.

34:06.037 --> 34:08.847
You knew Dr. Ogden's
thumb-mark would be there

34:08.853 --> 34:10.422
and you intended to remove it!

34:10.473 --> 34:12.632
- That's not true.
- No, I don't blame you,

34:12.657 --> 34:13.933
believe me, Detective.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.815
You set out to protect the woman you love.

34:16.567 --> 34:18.587
The romantic in me commends you.

34:24.344 --> 34:26.652
George, both you and I,

34:26.666 --> 34:28.223
there was nothing else we could do.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.025
I know, Emily, I just
feel like I've I let both

34:30.063 --> 34:31.790
Dr. Ogden and the Detective down.

34:31.815 --> 34:32.938
You told the truth,

34:33.059 --> 34:35.268
- you had no option.
- I should have...

34:36.489 --> 34:39.329
I should have left that
godforsaken gun where I found it.

34:45.737 --> 34:48.545
I think it's time we
adopt a change in strategy.

34:49.428 --> 34:50.516
What are you suggesting?

34:50.547 --> 34:51.706
Self-defense.

34:51.943 --> 34:54.859
Your husband was becoming
increasingly antagonistic.

34:54.902 --> 34:57.024
No. I can't lie.

34:57.024 --> 34:58.206
You won't have to.

34:58.269 --> 35:00.815
I can make the case without your testimony.

35:01.654 --> 35:04.538
I won't have you besmirching
my husband's good name.

35:04.582 --> 35:06.840
And I will not be denied
the chance to make my case.

35:06.853 --> 35:07.979
What case?

35:08.099 --> 35:10.087
Nothing you claim can be proven.

35:10.350 --> 35:13.022
You take the stand and the
Crown will paint you as a harlot

35:13.085 --> 35:16.607
who killed her husband because he was
standing in the way of her happiness.

35:18.879 --> 35:21.025
I can't say anything other than the truth.

35:21.462 --> 35:24.821
- I did not kill my husband.
- Is this all a big mistake?

35:25.147 --> 35:27.631
A series of conveniences and coincidences?

35:27.831 --> 35:29.776
Was it a vendetta against your husband?

35:29.770 --> 35:31.972
Or perhaps it's a vendetta against you.

35:32.679 --> 35:33.874
I don't know.

35:33.899 --> 35:37.002
And how do you explain the
overwhelming evidence against you?

35:38.748 --> 35:40.011
Claim self-defense

35:40.024 --> 35:42.608
or you will be convicted and you will hang.

35:45.467 --> 35:46.693
William?

35:49.296 --> 35:52.412
Julia, it could spare you the noose.

35:52.437 --> 35:53.338
And if you are innocent,

35:53.331 --> 35:55.377
it will give me the
time I need to prove it.

35:55.590 --> 35:56.729
If?

35:56.948 --> 35:58.543
- If I'm innocent?
- No, that isn't what I mean...

35:58.556 --> 35:59.607
Tell me, William.

36:00.474 --> 36:02.792
Why did you look for my
thumb-mark on the casing?

36:03.718 --> 36:06.026
To prove my innocence
or to establish my guilt?

36:06.070 --> 36:08.298
- Julia! Be sensible...
- Never mind.

36:08.491 --> 36:09.680
I will take the stand

36:09.705 --> 36:11.570
and I will tell the truth.

36:16.744 --> 36:20.523
Mrs. Penelope Irwin had undergone
a number of ferocious beatings

36:20.536 --> 36:21.881
at the hand of her husband.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.739
Were the authorities informed?

36:24.133 --> 36:26.461
She was terrified and
would have none of that.

36:27.212 --> 36:29.552
She confessed to me that
she was in fear for her life.

36:29.672 --> 36:31.461
And what did you do about that?

36:31.792 --> 36:34.876
I set up a safe haven
for her in Port Credit.

36:35.314 --> 36:37.191
I had reason to fear for her safety.

36:37.454 --> 36:38.981
Why is that?

36:40.025 --> 36:41.527
Shortly after she was admitted,

36:41.565 --> 36:43.468
she saw her husband outside the asylum.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.182
So you went to Port Credit?

36:45.463 --> 36:46.183
I did.

36:46.227 --> 36:48.998
And this operation had
to be conducted in secret.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.969
Is that why you told Dr. Clark,

36:51.013 --> 36:53.039
on the evening of your husband's death,

36:53.258 --> 36:54.998
that you were going to be in Markham?

36:55.335 --> 36:56.542
It is.

36:57.112 --> 36:59.564
And where is Mrs. Irwin now?

37:00.502 --> 37:03.987
I don't know. She either left
the safe haven out of fear,

37:04.463 --> 37:06.259
or her husband found her.

37:06.379 --> 37:08.737
Are you worried for her safety?

37:08.956 --> 37:09.994
I am.

37:11.521 --> 37:14.067
Did you kill Dr. Darcy Garland?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.923
No. I did not.

37:25.396 --> 37:28.342
Well, this is most inconvenient, isn't it?

37:29.049 --> 37:30.126
One individual

37:30.157 --> 37:32.847
who can confirm your alibi has disappeared.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.757
What about Desmond Irwin,
the woman's husband?

37:35.775 --> 37:37.965
Surely he can be forced to testify.

37:38.472 --> 37:39.842
He couldn't be found either.

37:39.962 --> 37:42.738
Isn't it true that no
one by that name exists?

37:43.082 --> 37:45.347
Because he doesn't exist.

37:45.710 --> 37:46.761
Because you made him up.

37:46.761 --> 37:48.194
You made up this whole story.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.521
Your Honour, is there a question here?

37:52.204 --> 37:54.563
Did you love your husband?

38:01.258 --> 38:02.221
Once.

38:02.341 --> 38:03.372
Once?

38:03.789 --> 38:04.992
Oh, yes, that's right.

38:05.049 --> 38:07.301
You were seeking a divorce
from him, were you not?

38:09.078 --> 38:10.004
I was.

38:10.629 --> 38:11.299
And why was that?

38:11.336 --> 38:13.483
Had he been unfaithful? Was he cruel?

38:14.040 --> 38:14.678
No.

38:14.684 --> 38:15.760
No. In fact from

38:15.810 --> 38:18.858
testimony we've heard today
he was an exemplary husband.

38:20.779 --> 38:23.125
On July 3rd, did you not spend the night

38:23.156 --> 38:25.640
at the Queen's Hotel
with Detective Murdoch?

38:26.416 --> 38:27.630
It wasn't what it seemed.

38:27.624 --> 38:29.463
Just answer the question, please.

38:32.729 --> 38:33.737
Yes.

38:34.306 --> 38:36.709
Are you in love with Detective Murdoch?

38:38.780 --> 38:39.768
Yes.

38:39.806 --> 38:41.902
- In fact you were hoping to marry him, weren't you?
- Yes.

38:41.939 --> 38:44.342
That's why you were seeking
the divorce, was it not?

38:44.661 --> 38:45.543
Yes.

38:45.581 --> 38:48.803
But the deceased refused
to grant you a divorce.

38:49.203 --> 38:51.268
In fact, did he not tell
you he would never ever

38:51.268 --> 38:52.719
grant you a divorce?

38:54.304 --> 38:55.185
Yes.

38:55.305 --> 38:57.149
I submit to you, Dr. Ogden,

38:57.174 --> 38:58.769
that you visited Dr. Garland that day

38:58.813 --> 39:00.790
to try to convince him one last time.

39:01.191 --> 39:02.298
And when he said no,

39:02.311 --> 39:04.194
you flew into a fit of rage

39:04.219 --> 39:05.264
and shot him dead. .

39:05.258 --> 39:06.766
That is not what happened

39:07.660 --> 39:10.125
No, I think you're right,
I don't think it was.

39:10.307 --> 39:11.947
I think you arrived early,

39:12.159 --> 39:14.030
- retrieved the weapon...
- That is not true.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.444
- Loaded the bullet into the chamber...
- I did not!

39:16.501 --> 39:19.792
- Would the witness kindly confine her...
- And cold-bloodedly removed

39:19.823 --> 39:22.889
- the single impediment to your happiness.
- I did not.

39:22.914 --> 39:26.073
- I did not!
- No further questions, Your Honour.

39:37.735 --> 39:39.956
It's not looking good.

39:40.475 --> 39:41.846
Murdoch, answer me this.

39:42.709 --> 39:45.299
You know the kind of
pressures Dr. Ogden was facing,

39:45.612 --> 39:47.202
do you think there's
even the slightest chance

39:47.240 --> 39:48.672
- she could have done this?
- No.

39:50.399 --> 39:52.526
Right then, that's good enough for me.

39:52.933 --> 39:54.835
There's got to be a chink
in the armour somewhere.

39:54.955 --> 39:56.318
So where do we start?

39:56.994 --> 39:58.933
Penelope and Desmond Irwin.

39:59.553 --> 40:02.061
A wife beater and an invisible woman.

40:02.243 --> 40:03.538
Low cards indeed.

40:03.763 --> 40:05.547
I don't care how low the cards are, sir.

40:05.591 --> 40:07.456
Someone orchestrated this.

40:10.603 --> 40:13.131
Sir, whatever you need...

40:13.251 --> 40:14.870
Thank you, George.

40:26.389 --> 40:29.022
William, whatever happens,

40:29.379 --> 40:31.294
I love you. You know that, don't you?

40:31.481 --> 40:33.358
Yes, yes.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.949
- Julia, I...
- All rise.

40:51.258 --> 40:53.009
Please be seated.

41:09.477 --> 41:12.230
The jury has come to a conclusion

41:12.530 --> 41:16.409
in the case of the Crown
versus Dr. Julia Ogden.

41:16.847 --> 41:20.219
Mr. Foreman, would you
kindly read your verdict?

41:25.044 --> 41:27.384
Of the capital crime of murder,

41:27.504 --> 41:31.262
the Jury finds the
defendant, Dr. Julia Ogden...

41:33.552 --> 41:36.717
guilty.

41:40.972 --> 41:42.824
Thank you, sir.

41:43.049 --> 41:45.927
Would the accused please stand?

41:50.456 --> 41:52.221
Dr. Ogden,

41:52.760 --> 41:55.593
despite your stellar reputation

41:55.996 --> 41:57.688
and diligent work

41:57.682 --> 42:00.516
for the Toronto Coroner's office,

42:00.898 --> 42:02.830
the nature of this crime

42:02.843 --> 42:05.251
is such that I have no recourse

42:05.276 --> 42:07.453
but to sentence you to be hanged

42:07.485 --> 42:10.344
by the neck until you are dead.

42:11.151 --> 42:13.842
May God have mercy on your soul.

42:15.506 --> 42:17.239
Court is adjourned.

42:23.302 --> 42:24.570
William...?!

42:24.810 --> 42:27.068
Julia, I'll get you out.

42:27.188 --> 42:30.096
No matter what happens, I will get you out!

42:32.022 --> 42:33.743
I'll get you out.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.986
Gillies?

42:56.222 --> 42:59.001
Look out! Excuse me!
Out of the way, please!

42:59.019 --> 43:00.264
Excuse me!

43:00.990 --> 43:02.341
Look out!

43:02.785 --> 43:04.418
Excuse me! Let me through!

43:17.951 --> 43:18.777
Excuse me.

43:18.827 --> 43:21.517
Did you see a man come out
here, with a straw hat on?

43:21.942 --> 43:23.250
Are you sure?

43:24.278 --> 43:25.202
Murdoch!

43:25.553 --> 43:26.623
Murdoch,

43:26.848 --> 43:29.431
- what the hell's going on?
- Sir, it was Gillies.

43:29.613 --> 43:31.552
I just saw James Gillies!
