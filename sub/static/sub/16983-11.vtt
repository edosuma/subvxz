00:01.168 --> 00:05.838
Some stories attribute
great powers to the Moon.

00:05.873 --> 00:08.507
It does have some effect on us.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.610
Since the time

00:11.645 --> 00:14.313
of the very first Apollo Moon mission...

00:14.348 --> 00:15.647
The Eagle has landed.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.616
...researchers have pored over

00:17.651 --> 00:19.551
photos of the Moon

00:19.587 --> 00:21.286
looking for structures,

00:21.322 --> 00:24.323
and they found some unusual things.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.692
Only 300 kilometers away

00:26.727 --> 00:30.629
from where Apollo 11 ended up landing.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.767
This area has undeniable architecture

00:34.802 --> 00:36.702
that looks like what you would see

00:36.737 --> 00:38.203
from obelisks.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.773
Somebody built something

00:40.808 --> 00:43.709
on the Moon a long, long time ago.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.245
And I don't think it was earthlings.

00:47.948 --> 00:48.914
The entire object

00:48.949 --> 00:51.383
may be of artificial origin.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.485
My question is,

00:53.521 --> 00:55.220
who built the Moon?

00:55.256 --> 00:58.690
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:58.726 --> 01:02.895
mankind has credited its origins to gods

01:02.930 --> 01:05.764
and other visitors from the stars.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.866
What if it were true?

01:07.902 --> 01:10.702
Did extraterrestrial beings

01:10.738 --> 01:14.273
really help to shape our history?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.475
And if so...

01:16.510 --> 01:20.612
might the answer be found
not on Earth but on the Moon?

# Ancient Aliens 11x11 #
Space Station Moon
Original Air Date on July 29, 2016

01:51.812 --> 01:57.282
Cape Canaveral, Florida.
February 8, 2016.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.285
NASA and Lockheed Martin
project managers

02:00.321 --> 02:02.921
announce preparations are underway

02:02.957 --> 02:05.457
for the Exploration Mission 1,

02:05.493 --> 02:09.461
a manned Orion spacecraft
journey to the Moon.

02:09.497 --> 02:14.700
The Chinese, Russian and Indian
space agencies follow suit,

02:14.735 --> 02:19.705
unveiling their own manned
lunar exploration plans.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.275
These missions would be the
first time humans traveled

02:23.310 --> 02:29.014
beyond low earth orbit
since Apollo 17 in 1972.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.883
But what could be the reason

02:30.918 --> 02:34.686
for this renewed interest in the Moon?

02:34.722 --> 02:39.858
And just why has it taken
humanity so long to go back?

02:42.863 --> 02:43.829
Liftoff.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.364
We have a liftoff.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.634
Liftoff on Apollo 11.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.503
Tranquility Base here.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.940
The Eagle has landed.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.976
July 20, 1969.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.711
Okay, Neil, we can see you

02:59.747 --> 03:01.213
coming down the ladder now.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.685
Over one billion
people worldwide are glued

03:06.720 --> 03:08.387
to their television sets

03:08.422 --> 03:11.523
as they watch the shadowy figure

03:11.559 --> 03:15.527
of astronaut Neil Armstrong
slowly step off the ladder

03:15.563 --> 03:17.863
of the Apollo 11 lunar module

03:17.898 --> 03:21.800
onto the surface of the Moon.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.674
That's one small step for man,

03:28.709 --> 03:31.910
one giant leap for mankind.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.882
The moment marks one
of the most important events

03:36.917 --> 03:39.017
in the history of civilization.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.554
It is the first time a human being

03:42.590 --> 03:45.424
has set foot on alien terrain.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.128
Apollo 11 is what people
think of when you talk about

03:50.164 --> 03:53.432
Apollo today and Neil Armstrong
setting foot on the Moon.

03:54.802 --> 03:59.771
The Moon is roughly 220,000
miles away from the Earth.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.309
Even the best telescopes
can't see what you can see

04:04.345 --> 04:06.445
when you're just
standing on the surface.

04:08.682 --> 04:12.017
Before we went to the Moon,
NASA was cautioned by

04:12.052 --> 04:15.721
doomsday predictors
and different people.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.589
People wonder what it would be
like on a place like that,

04:18.625 --> 04:22.127
so different from this place here.

04:22.162 --> 04:25.597
The idea of landing people on the Moon

04:25.633 --> 04:28.133
has been in the imagination
long before the technology

04:28.168 --> 04:30.736
was anywhere near making it possible.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.238
After all, to be on the Moon

04:33.274 --> 04:37.075
is to step into
a mythological landscape.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.810
The place of stories,
the place of wonder,

04:38.846 --> 04:40.145
to step into the heavens,

04:40.180 --> 04:43.582
and stand on ground of a kind

04:43.617 --> 04:45.117
that is not Earth.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.756
It was a huge moment
for the human spirit.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.226
While it was Americans
that put a man on the Moon,

04:54.261 --> 04:57.529
it was considered a victory
for all of humanity.

04:57.564 --> 05:01.266
Suddenly, science fiction became real

05:01.302 --> 05:04.469
and it opened up
a new age of exploration.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.607
I think that every journey

05:08.642 --> 05:10.809
starts with a first step.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.613
The Moon was our first step
into the universe,

05:14.648 --> 05:16.081
into our solar system.

05:16.116 --> 05:20.986
It is awesome to think
that already 50 years ago

05:21.021 --> 05:24.623
we became extraterrestrials
on another planet.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.563
The Moon has captivated

05:31.598 --> 05:33.832
the imagination of humanity

05:33.867 --> 05:37.502
since the dawn of civilization.

05:37.538 --> 05:41.206
It is a quarter the size of the Earth

05:41.241 --> 05:44.976
and is by far the most
dominant celestial body

05:45.012 --> 05:47.713
in the night sky.

05:47.748 --> 05:52.784
It takes about 30 days
to go round the Earth.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.186
The Moon glows and that's not
because of any property

05:54.221 --> 05:56.154
within the Moon.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.958
It's reflecting the rays of the
Sun, which causes it to glow.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.628
The reason that the
Moon has phases is that

06:03.664 --> 06:08.100
the Earth blocks the light of
the Sun as the Moon moves

06:08.135 --> 06:11.370
round the Earth, so it incrementally

06:11.405 --> 06:13.538
gets a little bit more
and a little bit more

06:13.574 --> 06:15.240
of the Sun's rays.

06:15.275 --> 06:18.377
The Moon's importance is very great.

06:18.412 --> 06:22.848
It leads to tides,
which helped life transition

06:22.883 --> 06:27.085
from living in the ocean
to living on land.

06:27.121 --> 06:32.424
It also stabilizes the Earth's
tilt relative to its orbit.

06:32.459 --> 06:35.794
Without the Moon,
gravitational influences

06:35.829 --> 06:38.964
can cause the poles of
planets to wander around

06:38.999 --> 06:42.300
kind of drunkenly,
like a drunken sailor.

06:42.336 --> 06:45.370
The Earth would have been a much
more chaotic place for life,

06:45.406 --> 06:49.107
especially advanced life, to develop

06:49.143 --> 06:50.575
if it wasn't for the Moon.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.047
While the Moon is largely responsible

06:56.083 --> 06:59.084
for allowing life to flourish on Earth,

06:59.119 --> 07:03.588
this celestial body itself
is inhospitable.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.892
It has no breathable oxygen

07:06.927 --> 07:09.995
and temperatures on the
surface reach extremes

07:10.030 --> 07:14.266
from 253 degrees Fahrenheit,
when it's facing the Sun,

07:14.301 --> 07:18.603
to -243 degrees in the shade.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.273
It was a very serious environment

07:21.308 --> 07:23.442
'cause there's no oxygen.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.410
So the astronauts,
once they were on the Moon,

07:25.446 --> 07:28.647
they have to be completely sealed.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.316
Its surface gravity,
which is what really counts

07:31.351 --> 07:34.152
if you're gonna go there, is
about a sixth of that on Earth,

07:34.188 --> 07:36.221
which is why when you see
those grainy images

07:36.256 --> 07:38.957
of the early astronauts,
they're sort of bouncing around,

07:38.992 --> 07:41.793
and the Moon has no atmosphere whatever.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.833
The astronauts,
once they were on the Moon,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.835
suddenly they were able
to look at the world

07:49.870 --> 07:54.039
that they'd grown up on, the
Earth, from a different place.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.708
They were able to see all of mankind

07:56.743 --> 07:59.411
in all its tininess in the universe.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.080
And that I know had
a very profound effect

08:02.115 --> 08:03.482
on the astronaut.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.921
Reaching the Moon was
such an unbelievable feat

08:09.957 --> 08:13.358
that even to this day,
many people are convinced

08:13.393 --> 08:19.264
the entire event was actually
staged in a Hollywood studio.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.767
But ancient astronaut theorists suggest,

08:22.803 --> 08:24.903
not only did we land on the Moon,

08:24.938 --> 08:30.075
but what we found there was
more incredible than we know.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.144
During the 1969 Apollo Moon mission,

08:33.179 --> 08:37.215
after the landing there was
a very strange two-minute gap

08:37.251 --> 08:39.484
in radio transmissions.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.785
And what happened
during those two minutes

08:41.822 --> 08:44.222
has been subject to
a lot of controversy.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.028
Neil, this is Houston,
radio check, over.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.899
Columbia, this is Houston, over.

08:57.538 --> 09:01.907
According to scientist
and NASA researcher Otto Binder,

09:01.942 --> 09:05.277
various ham radio operators
were able to intercept

09:05.312 --> 09:08.146
secret communications
with Mission Control

09:08.181 --> 09:10.949
that were not made public.

09:10.984 --> 09:14.586
The astronauts apparently talked about

09:14.621 --> 09:18.523
seeing extraterrestrial
objects on the Moon,

09:18.559 --> 09:24.062
including flying saucers parked
along the edge of a crater

09:24.097 --> 09:26.965
within their view.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.068
Now, the truth of it is,
is that each of the astronauts

09:30.103 --> 09:32.804
had a separate medical channel.

09:32.839 --> 09:36.408
That channel was not public
and it could have been

09:36.443 --> 09:39.244
very easily used to
communicate information

09:39.279 --> 09:41.279
that you didn't want to be heard

09:41.315 --> 09:43.882
over the general public transmissions.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.817
What's really interesting
about that story, though,

09:45.852 --> 09:48.853
is the fact that, within
30 minutes of the landing

09:48.889 --> 09:51.923
on the Moon, that story was
circulating around NASA

09:51.959 --> 09:53.358
that, "Hey, guess what.
They saw something

09:53.393 --> 09:55.427
"on the rim of a crater.
They were all upset.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.695
"They didn't know what to do.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.331
They didn't know if they should go out."

09:59.366 --> 10:02.567
It is interesting
when you watch the feed

10:02.603 --> 10:04.936
of when they came back from the Moon.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.339
They're not sitting there
jumping up and down for joy

10:07.374 --> 10:09.140
and saying, "I had the most
incredible experience

10:09.176 --> 10:11.242
in my life, I was on the Moon."

10:11.278 --> 10:12.444
They're not saying that.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.846
They look very solemn, very depressed.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.414
They're looking down.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.283
They almost look like
they want to vomit,

10:18.318 --> 10:22.120
that's how disturbed they look.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.389
Could they have seen something there

10:24.424 --> 10:26.424
that they didn't want to tell the public

10:26.460 --> 10:28.126
because of the implications?

10:30.931 --> 10:34.466
I believe that, uh...

10:34.501 --> 10:37.969
what this country set out to do was

10:38.005 --> 10:42.574
something that was going
to be done sooner or later.

10:42.609 --> 10:46.611
We find for the first time
that man has a...

10:46.647 --> 10:49.047
the flexibility or the option of, uh,

10:49.082 --> 10:53.418
either walking this planet
or some other planet.

10:53.453 --> 10:58.189
It's a-a beginning of a new age.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.296
After Apollo 11, NASA would send

11:05.332 --> 11:08.433
six more manned missions to the Moon,

11:08.468 --> 11:11.036
culminating with Apollo 17

11:11.071 --> 11:13.605
in 1972.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.473
One of the most interesting questions

11:15.509 --> 11:18.810
with regard to our
interaction with the Moon

11:18.845 --> 11:21.613
is why we have never
gone back there again

11:21.648 --> 11:25.583
since the Apollo missions,
and what else is very telling

11:25.619 --> 11:28.319
is that although the USSR at the time

11:28.355 --> 11:32.390
was getting to be quite able
to send its own astronauts

11:32.426 --> 11:35.060
to the Moon,
it never seems to have done so.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.863
Could it be that there were agencies

11:38.899 --> 11:40.999
associated with the Moon?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.001
Aliens or other beings

11:43.036 --> 11:47.072
who had warned humanity
to stay away for some reason?

11:50.444 --> 11:53.445
Is it possible that
the American astronauts

11:53.480 --> 11:55.547
were not alone on the Moon?

11:55.582 --> 11:59.384
Is that why after Apollo 17,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.553
we never went back?

12:01.588 --> 12:04.656
Some ancient astronaut theorists

12:04.691 --> 12:07.926
propose an even more
incredible possibility,

12:07.961 --> 12:11.596
that the Moon came
to orbit Earth not by chance,

12:11.631 --> 12:13.098
but by design.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.000
_

12:16.512 --> 12:18.445
Humans have been mesmerized

12:18.480 --> 12:20.747
by the Moon since the dawn of man.

12:22.952 --> 12:26.720
And although many theories
have been proposed,

12:26.755 --> 12:30.457
scientists cannot say
with absolute certainty

12:30.492 --> 12:33.927
how this celestial object
came into being.

12:36.365 --> 12:38.131
When I was a student, nobody really knew

12:38.167 --> 12:41.134
where the Moon came from
because it's so relatively big.

12:41.170 --> 12:42.836
Uh, this was a real problem.

12:42.871 --> 12:46.573
And I think that there is
a tendency to think that

12:46.608 --> 12:51.011
moons get somehow captured
by the parent planet.

12:51.046 --> 12:54.815
If you've got one body here and
another body come, coming along,

12:54.850 --> 12:57.985
it can't just get trapped
into orbit like that.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.787
The difficulty there
is just basic physics,

13:00.823 --> 13:02.356
and so this remained a puzzle

13:02.391 --> 13:05.125
until about 20 years ago
when another theory came along,

13:05.160 --> 13:06.827
and that is that

13:06.862 --> 13:09.529
the protoEarth was very early
on in the history

13:09.565 --> 13:14.601
of the solar system hit
by a Mars-sized body.

13:14.636 --> 13:17.938
Hit obliquely, that
this Mars-sized body

13:17.973 --> 13:19.373
plowed into the center of the Earth

13:19.408 --> 13:20.874
and became the Earth's core,
and a lot of

13:20.909 --> 13:23.410
the outer material
got stripped off by this

13:23.445 --> 13:28.949
gargantuan collision and
coalesced to form the Moon.

13:28.984 --> 13:32.819
Now, they had to come up
with a very, uh, bizarre theory

13:32.855 --> 13:35.322
for how the Moon came into being

13:35.357 --> 13:39.426
because all the conventional
theories don't make any sense.

13:39.461 --> 13:42.329
The best theory of the Moon's formation

13:42.364 --> 13:45.565
is a phantasmagorically

13:45.601 --> 13:49.469
catastrophic collision
of two things, you know,

13:49.505 --> 13:52.572
at just the right angle
to form this belt of debris

13:52.608 --> 13:56.009
that then formed the Moon, but the Moon,

13:56.045 --> 14:00.881
its exact size is such that
it gives us total eclipses.

14:00.916 --> 14:05.485
Its disc exactly covers the Sun.

14:05.521 --> 14:09.189
And the chances of that
occurring are so,

14:09.224 --> 14:12.292
literally, astronomically small,

14:12.327 --> 14:15.595
it's, it's very disturbing.

14:15.631 --> 14:19.900
The Sun's diameter is
400 times greater than the Moon

14:19.935 --> 14:23.603
and coincidentally the Sun
also happens to be

14:23.639 --> 14:27.808
nearly precisely 400 times further away.

14:27.843 --> 14:30.610
This is the reason
that the Sun and the Moon

14:30.646 --> 14:33.680
appear the same size in the Earth's sky

14:33.715 --> 14:38.852
and why we on Earth can
experience eclipses of the Sun.

14:38.887 --> 14:41.221
It's just perfectly in that orbit

14:41.256 --> 14:42.989
to eclipse our Sun.

14:43.025 --> 14:47.094
The odds of the Moon being
in that orbit accidentally

14:47.129 --> 14:49.429
are a zillion to one.

14:49.465 --> 14:53.366
So that right there is
evidence that our Moon

14:53.402 --> 14:57.571
is in a perfect orbit around our planet

14:57.606 --> 14:59.439
that's not accidental.

14:59.475 --> 15:03.710
In order to have a solar
eclipse the Moon has to be

15:03.745 --> 15:09.015
exactly the size that it is,
which is 2,160 miles.

15:09.051 --> 15:11.051
Not 2,161,

15:11.086 --> 15:12.986
not 2,159,

15:13.021 --> 15:17.324
but 2,160 miles at its equator.

15:17.359 --> 15:19.426
And there are people out there
that actually think

15:19.461 --> 15:22.095
that's a coincidence.

15:22.131 --> 15:25.632
The fact is, is that
that is by design.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.268
Throughout our observable galaxy,

15:28.303 --> 15:32.706
this relationship and others
have not been duplicated.

15:32.741 --> 15:36.443
Other moons are sizably
smaller by comparison

15:36.478 --> 15:38.612
to their mother planet.

15:38.647 --> 15:42.048
Earth's satellite not only
orbits closer than it should

15:42.084 --> 15:46.119
for its size, it is also the
only moon in the solar system

15:46.155 --> 15:50.290
that has a near-perfect circular orbit.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.958
And no other lunar bodies are known

15:51.994 --> 15:54.327
to have such a stabilizing role

15:54.363 --> 15:56.663
as the Moon has with the Earth.

15:56.698 --> 15:59.166
Recent computer simulations have shown

15:59.201 --> 16:02.235
that without the Moon's presence,
the Earth's axis tilt

16:02.271 --> 16:05.105
would be completely different
than it is today.

16:05.140 --> 16:08.408
We might not even have seasons
as we know them presently.

16:08.443 --> 16:09.976
Without the seasons

16:10.012 --> 16:12.646
it could be very difficult
for life on Earth.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.347
So the Moon is actually performing

16:14.383 --> 16:16.249
an incredible function.

16:16.285 --> 16:17.751
It's life-sustaining.

16:17.786 --> 16:20.820
Without it, we might not be here.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.190
There are so many peculiarities

16:23.225 --> 16:25.792
about the way the Moon
has affected the Earth

16:25.827 --> 16:27.794
that one might be forgiven for believing

16:27.829 --> 16:30.030
that there is intelligence behind it,

16:30.065 --> 16:33.633
that something made it that way.

16:33.669 --> 16:38.271
The Moon is so strange,
so odd in terms of what we find

16:38.307 --> 16:41.007
elsewhere in the solar system,
and particularly

16:41.043 --> 16:43.476
in terms of what it does for the Earth,

16:43.512 --> 16:46.746
having made the Earth
into a haven for life,

16:46.782 --> 16:51.318
that one feels obliged
to ask the question,

16:51.353 --> 16:55.956
"Could such things have
come about by chance?"

16:55.991 --> 16:58.658
Was it placed there deliberately?

16:58.694 --> 17:01.661
Was it engineered, maybe by aliens?

17:01.697 --> 17:03.830
And therefore,

17:03.865 --> 17:08.234
is our whole existence a planned event?

17:08.270 --> 17:11.137
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

17:11.173 --> 17:14.140
that the perfect size
and placement of the Moon

17:14.175 --> 17:17.109
may not be the product of mere chance,

17:17.145 --> 17:20.480
but was engineered by
extraterrestrial beings

17:20.515 --> 17:22.983
in Earth's prehistory.

17:23.018 --> 17:26.152
As evidence,
they point to ancient accounts

17:26.188 --> 17:30.223
that speak of a time before the
celestial object even existed.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.562
Beginning in the 5th century BC,

17:35.597 --> 17:37.964
Roman and Greek authors wrote of a time

17:38.000 --> 17:41.835
"before there was a moon in the heavens."

17:41.870 --> 17:47.440
Allusions to this can also be
found in the Hebrew Bible.

17:47.476 --> 17:49.309
And there are Zulu legends that say

17:49.344 --> 17:55.148
the Moon was brought to Earth
hundreds of generations ago.

17:55.183 --> 18:00.487
Wowane and Mpanku were
the names of two Zulu deities

18:00.522 --> 18:02.656
from prehistory.

18:02.691 --> 18:05.025
The Zulus have a legend that it was they

18:05.060 --> 18:07.961
who brought the Moon into existence.

18:07.996 --> 18:11.164
They supposedly did so
by stealing an egg

18:11.199 --> 18:15.201
from a giant sky dragon,
hollowing out the center,

18:15.237 --> 18:19.639
the yolk of the egg, and then
rolling the resultant planet

18:19.675 --> 18:21.641
across the sky to become the Moon.

18:21.677 --> 18:25.045
And the reason that the Zulus
say the Moon was put there

18:25.080 --> 18:27.647
was to keep an eye on human beings.

18:27.683 --> 18:29.416
The Zulu legend is really interesting.

18:29.451 --> 18:31.418
We first heard about it
from a Zulu shaman

18:31.453 --> 18:34.254
named Credo Mutwa,
and he talked about the fact

18:34.289 --> 18:37.490
that the Moon was towed in to our orbit.

18:37.526 --> 18:41.528
And when it did so,
it caused all kinds of floods

18:41.563 --> 18:45.332
and cataclysms, and it changed
the axis of the planet.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.434
And you can't help but wonder,

18:47.469 --> 18:49.969
could the Moon
be an artificial satellite?

18:50.005 --> 18:52.706
Could the Moon have come
from somewhere else

18:52.741 --> 18:55.809
and is now used as an observational base

18:55.844 --> 18:58.945
for extraterrestrial beings?

18:58.980 --> 19:02.615
Is it possible that
the Zulu legend is true,

19:02.651 --> 19:06.886
as ancient astronaut theorists suggest?

19:06.922 --> 19:11.758
Was our Moon towed into place
in the remote past?

19:11.793 --> 19:14.227
Perhaps further clues can be found

19:14.262 --> 19:17.497
by examining the scientific
evidence suggesting

19:17.532 --> 19:21.134
that the Moon is, in fact, hollow.

19:26.315 --> 19:28.649
The surface of the Moon is scarred

19:28.684 --> 19:34.454
with tens of thousands of impact
craters of various sizes.

19:34.490 --> 19:37.391
Scientists suggest
this is due to the fact

19:37.426 --> 19:40.360
that there has never been
an atmosphere on the Moon

19:40.396 --> 19:45.732
to help protect it from
bombardment by space debris.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.368
There are no natural erosive forces,

19:48.404 --> 19:52.839
like wind or flowing water,
to affect its surface.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.275
And there is little geologic activity

19:55.311 --> 19:59.913
to conceal damage done
throughout the Moon's history.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.581
When you study the
distribution of craters,

20:01.617 --> 20:04.484
you find the surface
is totally saturated,

20:04.520 --> 20:06.887
that is, that there are craters
within craters within craters,

20:06.922 --> 20:10.557
right down to the
smallest scale of size.

20:10.592 --> 20:12.392
One of the things
that's really interesting

20:12.428 --> 20:14.695
about lunar craters is that,
even though some of them

20:14.730 --> 20:17.264
are very large and some
of them are very small,

20:17.299 --> 20:19.366
they all seem to have the same depth,

20:19.401 --> 20:22.035
and that really shouldn't
happen on a planetary body.

20:22.071 --> 20:24.338
There should be variation in depth.

20:24.373 --> 20:27.874
So why are the Moon's craters so uniform?

20:27.910 --> 20:30.877
It's really, really unusual
and it's really not explainable

20:30.913 --> 20:35.449
in terms of conventional
or established geophysics.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.986
Some of the craters on the Moon
are nowhere near similar

20:39.021 --> 20:41.722
to what they should look like.

20:41.757 --> 20:46.393
In fact, they are
incredibly wide craters,

20:46.428 --> 20:50.364
and wherever the impact
point is, they're convex,

20:50.399 --> 20:52.532
which means there's still
the bulge of the Moon,

20:52.568 --> 20:56.503
so this doesn't make any sense.

20:56.538 --> 20:58.338
It's likely that there is something

20:58.374 --> 21:01.608
under the lunar surface,
which is very resilient

21:01.643 --> 21:05.979
and which is preventing craters
going any deeper than they do.

21:06.015 --> 21:09.016
This could only really
be either much harder rock,

21:09.051 --> 21:11.985
which it can't be because
of the mass of the Moon,

21:12.021 --> 21:15.989
or alternatively a
metal sphere of some kind

21:16.025 --> 21:17.691
which is preventing more damage.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.731
Does the uniform depth
of the craters on the Moon

21:24.767 --> 21:28.335
suggest some sort of metallic barrier

21:28.370 --> 21:31.438
underneath moon rock and dust?

21:31.473 --> 21:32.839
But if so,

21:32.875 --> 21:37.911
why wouldn't mainstream
scientists acknowledge this?

21:37.946 --> 21:42.115
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that by doing so,

21:42.151 --> 21:43.984
they might also have to acknowledge

21:44.019 --> 21:46.887
that the Moon may be hollow.

21:47.000 --> 21:47.500
_

21:50.059 --> 21:52.059
Yankee Clipper, Houston.

21:52.094 --> 21:54.828
November 20, 1969.

21:56.398 --> 22:00.000
During their ascent back
to the command module,

22:00.035 --> 22:02.035
Commander Charles Conrad Jr.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.905
and lunar module pilot Alan Bean

22:04.940 --> 22:07.707
release the Apollo 12 launch vehicle

22:07.743 --> 22:09.910
and crash it back to the Moon.

22:09.945 --> 22:14.081
Apollo 12, Houston,
the LM is on its way down.

22:14.116 --> 22:16.983
Roger.

22:17.019 --> 22:18.585
Upon impact,

22:18.620 --> 22:21.488
something very unexpected happened.

22:21.523 --> 22:24.791
The Moon was said to have
seismically reverberated

22:24.827 --> 22:27.694
like a bell for more than an hour.

22:27.729 --> 22:30.931
With Apollo 12, people refer to a crash.

22:30.966 --> 22:32.199
It wasn't really a crash.

22:32.234 --> 22:35.202
It was a aimed deorbit of the rocket

22:35.237 --> 22:38.572
used to lift off the, uh, lunar module.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.708
And the crew separated
the launch vehicle

22:41.743 --> 22:44.611
and crashed it back into the ground

22:44.646 --> 22:47.247
right close to where
they'd had a seismograph

22:47.282 --> 22:50.617
that they had installed down there.

22:50.652 --> 22:53.520
Well, it vibrated,
so it was kind of an early clue

22:53.555 --> 22:58.725
as to how solid was
the surface of the Moon.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.894
What was amazing about
this is that suddenly

23:00.929 --> 23:04.498
the Moon began to ring like a bell

23:04.533 --> 23:07.767
and did so for nearly an hour.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.203
Dr. Werner von Braun,
who was then the head of NASA,

23:10.239 --> 23:12.973
decided that for Apollo 13
they were going to

23:13.008 --> 23:16.843
intentionally crash a heavier
portion of the rocket

23:16.879 --> 23:19.546
into the lunar surface.

23:19.581 --> 23:21.248
And when they did this,

23:21.283 --> 23:26.019
the Moon rang like a gong this
time for over three hours

23:26.054 --> 23:29.122
into a depth of over 20 miles.

23:31.126 --> 23:35.061
This was not expected
and it still puzzles

23:35.097 --> 23:36.963
a lot of scientists today.

23:36.999 --> 23:40.700
The inference is that
the Moon must be hollow

23:40.736 --> 23:44.137
because the Moon is made
predominantly on the surface

23:44.173 --> 23:46.406
of a kind of rock called basalt.

23:46.441 --> 23:49.142
Although it's a very lightweight rock,

23:49.178 --> 23:53.113
it also absorbs impact extremely well.

23:53.148 --> 23:56.950
And so if the whole of the Moon
was made of that kind of rock,

23:56.985 --> 23:59.819
you wouldn't expect it to reverberate

23:59.855 --> 24:03.023
when a large impact took place.

24:03.058 --> 24:04.858
The reason that this is played down

24:04.893 --> 24:08.728
is because the idea
of the Moon being hollow

24:08.764 --> 24:11.998
just contradicts what
we know about physics.

24:14.469 --> 24:16.903
In his 1966 book,

24:16.939 --> 24:19.306
Intelligent Life in the Universe,

24:19.341 --> 24:22.976
renowned scientist
and astronomer Carl Sagan

24:23.011 --> 24:26.413
defined modern scholarship
regarding the composition

24:26.448 --> 24:30.684
of celestial bodies
throughout the cosmos.

24:30.719 --> 24:34.054
Carl Sagan suggested
that a natural satellite

24:34.089 --> 24:37.023
cannot be a hollow object.

24:37.059 --> 24:41.761
This is very odd because why
would the Moon be vibrating

24:41.797 --> 24:44.998
unless it's a hollow object?

24:45.033 --> 24:48.702
That would suggest it's artificial.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.037
Significant portions of the Moon

24:51.073 --> 24:52.739
may have been hollowed out.

24:52.774 --> 24:55.875
If that is the case, the chances are

24:55.911 --> 24:57.777
that was not achieved naturally.

24:57.813 --> 25:00.680
That would have to have been
achieved artificially.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.916
This brings up the important question,

25:02.951 --> 25:05.118
who would've had the ability, the skills,

25:05.153 --> 25:06.987
and the technology to do that?

25:07.022 --> 25:08.822
Certainly not us.

25:08.857 --> 25:11.658
That would only have to be
the work of extraterrestrials

25:11.693 --> 25:12.759
and no one else.

25:17.032 --> 25:20.100
Is it possible that the
Moon is not only hollow,

25:20.135 --> 25:23.703
but also an artificial structure?

25:23.739 --> 25:28.208
And if so, could it be
an extraterrestrial creation?

25:29.745 --> 25:34.314
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes and as evidence,

25:34.349 --> 25:36.783
they point to research indicating

25:36.818 --> 25:39.619
the Moon is actually...

25:39.655 --> 25:40.787
a spaceship.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.000
_

25:47.655 --> 25:49.021
Moscow, Russia.

25:49.056 --> 25:51.256
July 1970.

25:53.227 --> 25:58.931
After years of studying findings
from various Moon missions,

25:58.966 --> 26:00.732
two government scientists,

26:00.768 --> 26:04.670
Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov,

26:04.705 --> 26:07.539
publish an article in Sputnik magazine

26:07.574 --> 26:10.175
revealing their shocking conclusion

26:10.210 --> 26:12.711
about the nature of the Moon.

26:12.746 --> 26:16.415
Their theory is that
the Moon is likely a creation

26:16.450 --> 26:20.085
of alien intelligence
that was brought to Earth

26:20.120 --> 26:21.486
in the remote past.

26:25.159 --> 26:29.227
Two Russian physicists,
Vasin and Shcherbakov,

26:29.263 --> 26:30.529
came up with the idea that

26:30.564 --> 26:33.899
the Moon must be an artificial object.

26:33.934 --> 26:36.368
They based their ideas on, first of all,

26:36.403 --> 26:40.772
the fact that it appeared
that the Moon was hollow.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.442
Since no hollow planet could exist

26:43.477 --> 26:46.478
according to the known laws of physics,

26:46.513 --> 26:49.181
that would mean that the Moon
had to be an artificial,

26:49.216 --> 26:52.217
an engineered object.

26:52.252 --> 26:54.987
This article was quite groundbreaking.

26:55.022 --> 26:58.657
In fact, what they did is
to fundamentally redefine

26:58.692 --> 27:01.526
scholarship around what
we think the Moon is.

27:02.896 --> 27:06.298
Based on the maximum depth
of the Moon craters,

27:06.333 --> 27:09.434
Vasin and Shcherbakov proposed

27:09.470 --> 27:13.238
that the surface was
only 2½ miles thick.

27:13.273 --> 27:16.808
NASA scientists had determined
that this moondust

27:16.844 --> 27:22.381
primarily consisted of chromium,
titanium and zirconium.

27:22.416 --> 27:26.184
In their publication,
Vasin and Shcherbakov noted,

27:26.220 --> 27:29.254
"If a material had to be
devised to protect

27:29.289 --> 27:33.191
"a giant artificial satellite
from the unfavorable effects

27:33.227 --> 27:36.328
"of temperature from cosmic radiation

27:36.363 --> 27:38.730
"and meteorite bombardment,

27:38.766 --> 27:41.066
"the experts would probably have hit

27:41.101 --> 27:43.668
on precisely these elements."

27:43.704 --> 27:46.304
Now they themselves proposed

27:46.340 --> 27:49.174
that this suggestion is outlandish.

27:49.209 --> 27:52.310
However, only through their calculations

27:52.346 --> 27:54.312
and all the mathematics,

27:54.348 --> 27:58.250
they determined that
their theory is correct.

27:58.285 --> 28:02.487
We're talking people
in academia who may perhaps

28:02.523 --> 28:05.424
lose their position at the universities.

28:05.459 --> 28:08.260
I don't think anybody would
publish a paper like this

28:08.295 --> 28:13.765
unless they were 100% convinced
that their findings are true.

28:13.801 --> 28:18.236
The entire object may be
of artificial origin.

28:18.272 --> 28:21.206
And if that is the case, my question is:

28:21.241 --> 28:26.745
who built the Moon, who placed
it here, and how long ago?

28:27.981 --> 28:30.115
And so these Russian scientists,

28:30.150 --> 28:34.319
their theory is that
the Moon is a spaceship.

28:34.354 --> 28:36.121
It's got engines within.

28:36.156 --> 28:38.523
But that on the outside,
they've coated it

28:38.559 --> 28:41.927
with this moon-looking substance.

28:41.962 --> 28:46.164
Now, it's a farfetched idea,
but it makes a lot of sense

28:46.200 --> 28:50.836
in that you might want to
shroud or cloak this craft

28:50.871 --> 28:54.072
and make it look like a, uh,
very natural object.

28:55.909 --> 28:57.209
Since the publication

28:57.244 --> 29:00.011
of the Vasin and Shcherbakov article,

29:00.047 --> 29:05.417
other researchers have come out
in support of their theory.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.786
In 1975, Don Wilson wrote

29:07.821 --> 29:09.955
Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon.

29:09.990 --> 29:13.925
In 1976, George Leonard wrote
Somebody Else Is on the Moon,

29:13.961 --> 29:19.064
and these books further explored
a variety of anomalies.

29:19.099 --> 29:21.066
Now, they note some very bizarre things.

29:21.101 --> 29:24.603
For example, the mineral
and metallic composition

29:24.638 --> 29:27.172
of the material on the Moon
is not like anything

29:27.207 --> 29:30.542
that we see on Earth,
and the apparent age of the Moon

29:30.577 --> 29:34.079
seems to be greater than the
actual age of our solar system.

29:34.114 --> 29:36.848
So they believe that the Moon
was actually brought here

29:36.884 --> 29:37.816
from somewhere else.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.587
Lots of people have
talked about the idea

29:42.623 --> 29:44.589
that the Moon itself
is actually a spacecraft,

29:44.625 --> 29:48.193
that it was piloted here and
put in this particular orbit.

29:48.228 --> 29:51.463
There's no question that
there's evidence that the Moon

29:51.498 --> 29:55.100
could be a modified natural object.

29:55.135 --> 29:58.637
There are ancient stories
that speak of a time

29:58.672 --> 30:02.207
when the Moon was not up in the sky

30:02.242 --> 30:05.610
and there are descriptions
that say that the Moon

30:05.646 --> 30:09.314
was artificially pulled into place.

30:09.349 --> 30:14.586
So if we have two modern Russian
scientists who have suggested

30:14.621 --> 30:17.255
that perhaps the Moon
was pulled into place,

30:17.291 --> 30:21.226
and that is a corroboration
of ancient mythologies,

30:21.261 --> 30:24.062
that's when I listen.

30:24.097 --> 30:27.098
So the whole idea that our Moon

30:27.134 --> 30:31.703
is some gigantic hollow spaceship

30:31.738 --> 30:36.508
that's been put into a special
orbit around our planet,

30:36.543 --> 30:39.544
and contains cities and structures

30:39.580 --> 30:43.982
that are inside and outside of the Moon

30:44.017 --> 30:47.886
is to me a very reasonable assertion.

30:47.921 --> 30:51.389
And in fact it would
seem to be that our Moon

30:51.425 --> 30:56.294
is some kind of gigantic
artificial spaceship

30:56.330 --> 31:00.232
that is here to monitor our planet.

31:00.267 --> 31:02.334
Would I discount the fact that the Moon

31:02.369 --> 31:08.206
is a foreign object,
a spaceship, a Death Star?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.874
I don't think you can rule that out.

31:11.111 --> 31:13.111
Is it possible that the Moon

31:13.146 --> 31:15.680
is actually a spacecraft?

31:15.716 --> 31:18.250
And might it have allowed
extraterrestrials

31:18.285 --> 31:21.620
to discreetly monitor our planet?

31:21.655 --> 31:26.791
But if so, might these beings
still be there today?

31:29.500 --> 31:30.000
_

31:32.224 --> 31:36.293
November 1966.

31:36.328 --> 31:40.664
Three years before the Apollo
astronauts made it to the Moon,

31:40.699 --> 31:45.802
the Orbiter 2 spacecraft
situates itself in lunar orbit.

31:45.838 --> 31:49.239
It was designed to capture
high-resolution images

31:49.275 --> 31:53.510
of the surface to assist with
the selection of landing sites

31:53.545 --> 31:56.079
for the Apollo missions.

31:56.115 --> 32:00.217
One image in particular catches
the eye of researchers,

32:00.252 --> 32:03.487
as it shows what appear
to be the shadows

32:03.522 --> 32:06.924
of several pointed spires.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.960
On November 20, 1966,

32:09.995 --> 32:12.963
the Lunar Orbiter 2, NASA's probe,

32:12.998 --> 32:16.033
photographs this area on the Moon

32:16.068 --> 32:18.535
that was actually
in the Sea of Tranquility,

32:18.570 --> 32:22.406
only 300 kilometers away
from where Apollo 11

32:22.441 --> 32:24.241
ended up landing.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.277
And, what's so bizarre is that this area

32:27.313 --> 32:32.616
has undeniable architecture that
looks like what you would see

32:32.651 --> 32:36.520
from obelisks.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.522
There's eight different spires.

32:38.557 --> 32:42.392
And scientists calculated that
the largest of these spires

32:42.428 --> 32:45.996
would be an obelisk that
is 15 stories tall.

32:48.233 --> 32:52.569
These do appear to be just like
an Egyptian-style obelisk.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.638
But, what the heck
are they doing on the Moon?

32:57.576 --> 32:59.710
Of the multiple anomalies on the Moon,

32:59.745 --> 33:03.814
I think the spires are some
of the most fascinating ones

33:03.849 --> 33:08.018
because astronomers have calculated

33:08.053 --> 33:11.722
that these spires are very tall

33:11.757 --> 33:17.060
for them to be exclusively
natural occurrences.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.729
They have to be artificial,

33:18.764 --> 33:22.366
simply from the fact that
the Moon has been bombarded

33:22.401 --> 33:26.036
in kind of an incessant meteoric rain

33:26.071 --> 33:30.207
for 4.5 billion years.

33:30.242 --> 33:34.144
There is no way that anything
bigger than a basketball

33:34.179 --> 33:37.981
can be standing straight up
on the lunar surface.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.486
The inference is that
NASA would have known this

33:42.521 --> 33:45.489
and that one of the reasons that
they sent their mission there

33:45.524 --> 33:48.458
was so that the astronauts
of the Apollo mission

33:48.494 --> 33:50.994
could gain more information about these

33:51.030 --> 33:53.330
artificial structures on the Moon.

33:57.036 --> 34:00.003
CAPCOMM, we're a go for undocking.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.739
Roger, Eagle, undock.

34:02.775 --> 34:05.475
On Apollo 11, when the
astronauts were descending

34:05.511 --> 34:06.743
to the lunar surface,

34:06.779 --> 34:09.679
they got this very strange
computer alarm.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.514
The 1202 alarm.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.984
-1202.
-1202 alarm.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.851
The famous 1202 computer alarm.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.255
Basically, nobody knew what it was.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.858
What it came out to, um,
was that the computer itself

34:21.893 --> 34:26.362
was overwhelmed with information
because Buzz Aldrin,

34:26.398 --> 34:27.931
the lunar module pilot,

34:27.966 --> 34:31.435
had turned on the radars
on the lunar lander.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.271
It had two radars--
it had a side looking radar

34:34.306 --> 34:35.938
and it had a docking radar.

34:35.974 --> 34:38.041
So, in other words,
you had one that pointed down

34:38.077 --> 34:39.643
and one that pointed to the side.

34:39.678 --> 34:43.612
Now, if there's nothing
on the surface of the Moon,

34:43.649 --> 34:45.382
if there are no artificial structures,

34:45.417 --> 34:50.520
if there are no spires sticking
ten, 20 stories up into the sky,

34:50.556 --> 34:52.656
why would you turn on the side radar?

34:52.690 --> 34:54.623
There's no reason to, but Aldrin did it.

34:54.659 --> 34:58.795
And, I think it's because
he knew and NASA knew

34:58.831 --> 35:02.599
that there was some danger
of running into these things.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.635
Is it possible that
NASA actually has knowledge

35:05.671 --> 35:08.205
of structures on the Moon?

35:08.240 --> 35:11.975
In 1960, NASA officials
commissioned a report

35:12.010 --> 35:15.345
from the Brookings Institute
to weigh the implications

35:15.380 --> 35:19.816
of the discovery of evidence
of extraterrestrial life.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.685
Due to the findings of the report,

35:21.720 --> 35:24.287
researchers believe it was determined

35:24.323 --> 35:27.757
before the Moon missions to keep
any extraterrestrial findings

35:27.793 --> 35:29.626
hidden from the public

35:29.661 --> 35:34.297
for fear of social unrest.

35:34.333 --> 35:38.535
Since the time of the very
first Apollo Moon missions,

35:38.570 --> 35:43.807
researchers have pored
over NASA and Russian photos

35:43.842 --> 35:48.445
of the Moon looking for structures.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.715
And they found some unusual things.

35:51.750 --> 35:55.285
You would think, in fact,
that if extraterrestrials

35:55.320 --> 35:58.188
are on the Moon or were,
that they would have built

35:58.223 --> 35:59.956
all kinds of structures.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.726
And we're able to see some of these,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.828
even though NASA scientists

36:04.863 --> 36:08.198
don't acknowledge them as genuine.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.435
But perhaps as intriguing

36:12.471 --> 36:16.640
as the various structures seen
on the surface of the Moon

36:16.675 --> 36:18.775
are the numerous reports of lights

36:18.810 --> 36:22.812
and other unexplainable activity.

36:22.848 --> 36:26.316
Intermittent reflections
emanating from the lunar surface

36:26.351 --> 36:29.352
have been observed
for more than a century,

36:29.388 --> 36:32.689
including by famed astronomer
Francis Bailey

36:32.724 --> 36:35.458
in 1835.

36:35.494 --> 36:40.564
And the phenomenon was also
reported by the Apollo 11 crew.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.299
The windows are all dark.

36:42.334 --> 36:45.735
And that's when I began
seeing a flash and a streak

36:45.771 --> 36:47.904
and another flash.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.808
Flicker flashes we called them.
Kept seeing them.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.477
And I said,
"You guys see anything unusual?

36:54.513 --> 36:56.746
You see any flashes?"

36:56.782 --> 36:58.715
Neil said,
"Yeah, I saw about 100 of them."

36:58.750 --> 36:59.883
"How about you, Mike?"

36:59.918 --> 37:02.519
"Nah, I didn't see a thing."

37:02.554 --> 37:06.456
Any deep analysis by the crew
as to what the hell it was?

37:06.491 --> 37:08.825
No.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.861
'Cause we were, we were on our way home.

37:11.897 --> 37:15.465
Let's, let's let somebody else
worry about that.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.301
These things were
actually disclosed by NASA

37:18.337 --> 37:22.072
in their own transient lunar
anomalies catalog

37:22.107 --> 37:27.043
showing lights moving around,
showing puffs of smoke,

37:27.079 --> 37:31.514
showing things that should not
be there on the Moon's surface,

37:31.550 --> 37:35.418
all of which suggests that there
is, in fact, a very thriving

37:35.454 --> 37:39.089
extraterrestrial community
living on the Moon today.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.360
Might there not only be structures

37:43.395 --> 37:48.598
on the lunar surface but
also unidentified activity?

37:48.634 --> 37:52.335
Activity that might point
to current extraterrestrial

37:52.371 --> 37:55.138
occupation of the Moon?

37:55.173 --> 37:58.341
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

37:58.377 --> 38:01.978
and suggest that further
evidence may be found

38:02.014 --> 38:03.980
on the dark side of the Moon.

38:06.500 --> 38:07.000
_

38:09.171 --> 38:11.972
The Moon is the most
visible celestial body

38:12.007 --> 38:15.008
in the night sky.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.711
But we only ever see one side

38:17.746 --> 38:20.614
as it is in synchronous
rotation with Earth,

38:20.649 --> 38:24.918
meaning it takes just as long to
rotate around its own axis

38:24.953 --> 38:28.755
as it does to complete
its orbit around our planet.

38:28.790 --> 38:31.825
Therefore, we can only observe one side,

38:31.860 --> 38:35.962
and up to 41% of the Moon's
surface is never seen.

38:35.998 --> 38:38.031
The Moon is in what we call
synchronous rotation

38:38.066 --> 38:39.733
with the Earth.

38:39.768 --> 38:43.203
That is that the effect
of the gravity of the Earth

38:43.238 --> 38:46.873
and the Moon means that the Moon
only shows us one side,

38:46.909 --> 38:49.809
its one face, the face that
we're all familiar with.

38:51.980 --> 38:55.782
The reason for this
is because when two objects

38:55.817 --> 38:57.751
get close enough to each other,
they do become

38:57.786 --> 39:00.020
so-called phase-locked in that manner.

39:00.055 --> 39:03.156
It means it presents
the same face to the Earth

39:03.191 --> 39:05.325
the whole time.

39:07.663 --> 39:09.529
Because of the tidal locking

39:09.564 --> 39:13.934
of the Moon's rotation,
it presents the same face.

39:13.969 --> 39:17.170
And of course this leads to speculation

39:17.205 --> 39:19.539
because this creates a perfect place

39:19.574 --> 39:21.474
to create large installations on the Moon

39:21.510 --> 39:25.278
that are not directly
observable from Earth.

39:25.314 --> 39:27.380
Hypothetically,
the far side of the Moon,

39:27.416 --> 39:31.051
it's an excellent place to put up bases.

39:31.086 --> 39:34.187
And that has been a fixture
of a lot of science fiction.

39:35.657 --> 39:37.590
There have been
whistle-blowers that say that

39:37.626 --> 39:39.960
they've been taken to a base,

39:39.995 --> 39:42.529
which is called
Lunar Operations Command,

39:42.564 --> 39:45.265
on the far side of the Moon
and that this base

39:45.300 --> 39:50.003
is part of a network of bases
on the far side of the Moon

39:50.038 --> 39:53.974
that are run by various
secret space programs

39:54.009 --> 39:57.344
and extraterrestrial civilizations.

39:57.379 --> 40:00.914
The Apollo missions have taken
surveillance photographs

40:00.949 --> 40:04.050
of the Moon's surface
and some of the photographs

40:04.086 --> 40:07.520
have shown what appear to be structures.

40:10.359 --> 40:12.826
Could it be that there are active bases

40:12.861 --> 40:14.794
on the far side of the Moon?

40:14.830 --> 40:17.797
Not only secret military bases,

40:17.833 --> 40:21.634
but extraterrestrial bases as well?

40:21.670 --> 40:26.172
And if so, what would happen if
the full truth about the Moon

40:26.208 --> 40:30.276
was finally revealed
to the general public?

40:30.312 --> 40:35.615
Ultimately when the truth
of the origin of the Moon

40:35.650 --> 40:37.717
and what is going on in the Moon,

40:37.753 --> 40:39.819
and-and structures on the Moon,

40:39.855 --> 40:45.658
and perhaps even occupation of
the Moon is revealed to humans

40:45.694 --> 40:51.164
on Earth, it will be a
shattering of our reality.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.134
And we'll be able to look up in the sky

40:54.169 --> 40:57.937
and see what is an
extraterrestrial object

40:57.973 --> 41:01.007
in orbit around our planet.

41:01.043 --> 41:04.811
And we'll know it for what it is.

41:04.846 --> 41:07.180
There's not a single
scientifically valid reason

41:07.215 --> 41:11.017
not to think that it's
an extraterrestrial spacecraft

41:11.053 --> 41:13.653
brought here by extraterrestrial beings

41:13.688 --> 41:16.222
in order to assist humankind.

41:16.258 --> 41:18.258
For some, that's a terrifying thought.

41:21.463 --> 41:23.997
Did the Apollo astronauts encounter

41:24.032 --> 41:28.902
more on the surface of the Moon
than was publicly revealed?

41:28.937 --> 41:31.971
Might there have been
evidence of colonization,

41:32.007 --> 41:36.409
or even that the Moon itself
is an artificial object?

41:36.445 --> 41:40.847
And could this be
why we stopped going back?

41:40.882 --> 41:43.116
Perhaps the upcoming Moon missions,

41:43.151 --> 41:45.585
the first in over four decades,

41:45.620 --> 41:48.755
will finally reveal the full truth

41:48.790 --> 41:52.025
about this mysterious celestial body

41:52.060 --> 41:55.862
and also about our
extraterrestrial past.
