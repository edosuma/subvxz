00:57.360 --> 00:59.522
I'm going back to work.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.045
Don't worry,
I checked her out.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.046
Agent
falls in love with girl.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.043
Agent runs 'em up.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.123
Girl gets kidnapped.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.248
The other guys wanna know
the agent's source.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.368
What does he do?

01:23.560 --> 01:26.723
What do they do
to the girl, hmm?

01:28.320 --> 01:31.210
- Is there a point to this?
- Yeah.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.205
Over your right shoulder.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.404
- Us or them?
- How the fuck should I know?

01:49.405 --> 01:51.926
Does it really matter?

02:00.040 --> 02:03.681
You feel the need for
a relationship? Get a dog.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.205
Channel four.

02:16.640 --> 02:21.202
Oh, shit! Mason, give us a hand
with this mike, will you?

02:21.360 --> 02:23.840
Want me to put your corsage
on too, Miss Prom Queen?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sit on this and twist.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.400
You're funny.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.566
Hanley.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.566
Right.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.639
We have confirmation.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.960
There's definitely a credible
threat. We've got 20 minutes.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.446
You ready?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.559
Mason, you ready?

02:44.560 --> 02:47.131
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.850
- Comm check, one, two.
- Good hunting.

02:57.851 --> 02:58.887
Copy-

03:08.800 --> 03:10.399
Hi, there.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.879
Ambassador, I'm gonna
need your clothes.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.245
We believe there may be
an attempt

03:14.246 --> 03:16.049
on your life this morning.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.320
<i>Target is male,
Caucasian, 35 to 40.</i>

03:42.200 --> 03:46.364
- Wanna bet your life on that?
- No. I'm <i>betting</i> on you.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.405
This is it, Peter.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.601
<i>I'm in
the yellow building,</i>

04:01.602 --> 04:03.682
<i>green shutters,
left of the clock tower.</i>

04:04.720 --> 04:06.210
How many potentials?

04:12.560 --> 04:14.881
Too many.
I don't like it.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.250
<i>Call off the op,
we don't have the coverage.</i>

04:18.252 --> 04:20.368
We're not calling this op.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.850
Body armor is not
gonna stop a head shot.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.049
I've been having
these headaches, anyway.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.729
Blue suit, two o'clock.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.443
Got him.
He's moving.

04:43.444 --> 04:45.522
Hold your shot.
Hold your shot.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.479
Check your line of fire.
Don't shoot!

04:47.480 --> 04:49.080
<i>- No, he's moving on you.
- Do not shoot!</i>

04:57.680 --> 04:59.205
Devereaux?

04:59.720 --> 05:02.291
Jesus.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.248
<i>He tagged you,
I had to hit him!</i>

05:14.440 --> 05:16.283
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.730
Learn to take orders.

05:26.120 --> 05:30.444
No! No, no, no...

05:49.360 --> 05:51.931
Peter? There is a man
outside by the water.

05:51.932 --> 05:53.410
He says he knows you.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.649
That's it?

06:06.840 --> 06:09.241
No "Hello, Hanley,
good to see you"?

06:09.400 --> 06:12.449
- "Been a long time"?
- You still out of Berlin?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.802
Berlin? Christ, no.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.849
The action's moved,
my friend.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.809
The frontline
is now in Belgrade.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.369
You look good.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.450
Better than him, at least.

06:27.451 --> 06:30.250
- Kargan.
- Retirement got him fat.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.526
- Not her, though.
- Oh, God.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.442
Craig.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.239
They knew the risks.
We all did.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.049
We lD'd the killer.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.479
Alexa Demoystria.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.205
Contract killer out of Moscow.

06:49.206 --> 06:52.647
She's cutting a swath through people
who have no business dying.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.004
Agency thinks
it's Arkady Federov

06:55.005 --> 06:58.402
killing anyone or anything
that reminds him of his past.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.490
The guy's gonna be
the next Russian president.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.210
What's this got to do with me?

07:16.920 --> 07:18.410
Natalia.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.963
You'd be proud of her, Peter.

07:20.964 --> 07:25.079
After you left, she got
very close to Federov.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.447
But she wants to come in.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.449
She has something on him.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.970
Something that's scaring
even her.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.679
- What?
- A name.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.366
Claims it changes everything.
And if she's right,

07:40.720 --> 07:43.246
how long before you think
she's gonna join these?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.599
You go in,
you get her out.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.639
Moscow to Petersburg.

07:50.640 --> 07:54.167
Cross the border to Helsinki,
I'll meet you there.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.568
She asked for you.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.243
Only you.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.880
She won't give you the name
until you bring her out, right?

08:11.760 --> 08:13.922
She always was a ballbuster.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.168
Drone's airborne.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.645
Exfil on standby.
Monitoring.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.165
Bravo! Bravo!

12:24.680 --> 12:26.125
Do you have a link
to the drone?

12:26.126 --> 12:27.531
Yes, we do.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.929
Rendezvous with
the extraction team in...

12:33.720 --> 12:35.324
...four minutes.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.889
We have eyes
on the prize.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.002
Traveling northbound
on Tverskaya.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.643
Message received from prize.

12:54.644 --> 12:56.529
We are five minutes
from exfil.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.890
Langley's online.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.285
What time is it there, Perry?

13:05.286 --> 13:07.123
You don't need to be
in on this one.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.931
<i>If our girl's actually got
something on Federov,</i>

13:09.932 --> 13:12.048
<i>a lot of people are interested.</i>

13:12.920 --> 13:15.366
Subject's nearing
extraction location.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.450
Sir, we have an issue.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.999
- Who?
- It looks like FSB.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.764
The Russians
have made her.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.169
Get in the car!

14:28.240 --> 14:30.322
Peter! Why are you here?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.682
Whose car is that
she got into?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.889
Whoever it is,
it's not us.

14:43.480 --> 14:48.039
How is Lucy? Hmm?

14:48.040 --> 14:49.405
She misses you.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.288
I miss her too.
Both of you.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.567
We're tracking
from parallel streets.

14:57.880 --> 15:01.919
Plotting intercept location...
Tverskoy Boulevard.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.651
<i>Belgrade Control, send 42.
Mason's got the ball.</i>

15:04.652 --> 15:09.646
<i>- No! Perry, you can't
- Belgrade Control, send 42.</i>

15:09.720 --> 15:11.609
<i>Mason's got the ball.</i>

15:17.080 --> 15:19.359
- Op One.
- Copy.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.840
Forty-two. Confirm.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.924
Forty-two, confirm.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.199
You have a name.
I need it.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.362
Right now,
I need the name!

15:46.360 --> 15:47.725
Mira Filipova.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.851
- Yes.
- Mira Filipova.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.169
Mira Filipova.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.090
Peter, you're blown.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.649
Forty-two complete.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.764
Peter...

17:27.000 --> 17:29.241
She was one of ours, Weinstein.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.319
<i>It was over when
the Russians made her.</i>

17:32.320 --> 17:33.685
<i>We did her a favor.</i>

18:02.080 --> 18:04.003
Go, go!
Get down!

18:40.440 --> 18:42.599
I've tapped
into a CCTV feed.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.045
<i>What the hell's
going on?</i>

18:44.046 --> 18:46.042
Op One, this is Control.
Respond.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.326
<i>What happened?</i>

18:48.520 --> 18:50.170
Op Two, respond.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.206
It was Devereaux.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.251
It was goddamn Devereaux!
What was he doing here?

19:13.600 --> 19:14.840
Who's Devereaux?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.767
<i>Peter Devereaux,
one of ours.</i>

19:18.880 --> 19:20.882
<i>Active '77 to '08.</i>

19:21.760 --> 19:23.489
<i>Used to work with Hanley.</i>

19:25.440 --> 19:27.439
<i>I'm on the next plane down.</i>

19:27.440 --> 19:29.204
<i>Bring Mason in.</i>

20:18.800 --> 20:20.643
Mira Filipova.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.651
Go, go, go!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.610
- Oh, Smokey!
- I think this belongs to you.

21:43.611 --> 21:46.919
Come here, you dumb cat.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.490
She spends so much time
in my apartment,

21:48.491 --> 21:49.561
she should pay some rent.

21:49.562 --> 21:51.369
She likes you better than me.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.051
Would you like to come in
for a cup of coffee?

21:55.052 --> 21:57.930
I just made some.
Tastes like home.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.964
Sorry, work.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.005
Hello?

22:18.720 --> 22:21.087
Hi, I'm looking for
Alice Fournier.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.245
Alice!

22:24.840 --> 22:26.888
- Can I help you?
- Yes, hello.

22:26.889 --> 22:28.799
My name's Edgar Simpson.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.320
I'm an investigative journalist.
I work with The New York Times.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.524
I want to talk to you
about this man.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.639
Arkady Federov.
He's a Russian politician.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.722
I'm researching a story on him.

22:55.560 --> 22:56.839
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.410
I have reservation.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.410
Why didn't you shoot?
Here.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.959
Why didn't you shoot?

23:41.960 --> 23:44.406
Yes, Mr. Mason,
why didn't you shoot?

23:44.920 --> 23:46.565
There was no threat, sir.

23:46.566 --> 23:48.844
The man who just assassinated
your entire team

23:48.845 --> 23:51.684
is pointing a gun at you,
and you say there was no threat.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.649
Devereaux was disoriented.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.324
He didn't expect to see me there.

23:56.325 --> 23:58.448
He was doing exactly
what I would have done.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.410
We tried to kill him.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.206
He killed us.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.482
You gleaned all this
in less than two seconds?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.843
Yes, sir.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.842
The question remains:

24:13.240 --> 24:14.924
Why didn't you shoot?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.610
Why didn't he shoot?

24:33.560 --> 24:36.530
- You think you know Devereaux?
- Just let me find him.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.726
If I can talk to him, maybe I can
stop this from getting crazy.

24:40.727 --> 24:42.961
You don't know him.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.084
I know how he trained you.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.690
No connections.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.323
But there were things
in this world

25:02.324 --> 25:04.004
that mattered
to Peter Devereaux.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.443
People he let inside,
people he loved, perhaps.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.968
And we just killed
a very important one.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.319
And now he'll come after us
with everything he's got.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.845
That's how he's wired.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.848
He killed three of our people.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.482
The call is to
terminate Devereaux.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.851
Do you have a problem
with the call?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.962
I do what I'm told to do, sir.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.644
Hard drive's OK.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.645
I think I've got something here.

25:59.646 --> 26:00.799
What do you got?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.245
It's what we're looking for.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.087
The last search that Hanley ran.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.722
See what else
you can find.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.681
Uh. Everything's a real mess.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.242
What a clusterfuck.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.087
Hi. How you doing?
I got some stuff for you.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.679
Look, this girl, Mira,
arrives Belgrade late '90s.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.599
UN refugee.
She's processed by these two.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.762
They hand it off
to a social worker,

27:17.763 --> 27:20.081
this woman, Alice Fournier.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.601
Two or three other girls
were friends.

27:23.602 --> 27:26.080
You know,
prostitutes, junkies.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.166
Last trace of your Mira
was a decade ago.

27:29.167 --> 27:32.482
If she was anything like her
friends, she's probably dead.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.971
Give me her.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.679
Here you go.
She has lunch plans.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.967
Dva Jelena Restaurant.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.362
You're very welcome.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.802
Biometric mets from
Belgrade Airport arrivals coming up.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.729
It says four hours ago.
There.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.650
He looked right at the camera.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.439
Yeah?

28:34.440 --> 28:36.721
<i>I have the crew from
Hanley's. They have something.</i>

28:37.360 --> 28:39.601
Cleaners at Hanley's
have a possible hit.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.010
Authorization
and access codes positive.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.679
Go ahead.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.489
<i>Yes, this is Jurgen.</i>

28:46.800 --> 28:51.199
I need location information
on a subject... Fournier.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.850
Alice.

28:53.040 --> 28:59.605
Cell number 75365423.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.447

29:02.448 --> 29:04.727
Fournier, Alice.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.489
Cell 75365423.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.562
Current location: Skadarska 32.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.919
I believe that's a restaurant.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.081
<i>Thank</i> you.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.883
How many on station
at Hanley's?

29:27.884 --> 29:29.006
Two.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.561
Call the other one.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.524
There's no answer.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.445
It's Devereaux.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.761
Thank you for deciding
to meet with me.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.564
Please, sit down.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.690
I won't stay long.
Thank you.

30:40.080 --> 30:44.529
- Would you like something?
- Water's fine. Thanks.

30:45.440 --> 30:49.126
So, let's talk
about Arkady Federov.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.965
In the work I do,
it's a name I hear a lot.

30:53.966 --> 30:57.646
But he's old news.
Atrocities are like reality TV.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.766
There's always a new show
for people to forget.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.039
Agreed.
However, now Federov

31:03.040 --> 31:04.485
is about to become
president of Russia.

31:04.486 --> 31:06.604
That makes him a person
of interest to the world

31:06.605 --> 31:08.045
and to my publication.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.482
When Federov
was just a general,

31:10.483 --> 31:12.084
I'd say he was
pretty much untouchable.

31:12.085 --> 31:14.401
But it's different now.
He's vulnerable.

31:14.402 --> 31:16.243
What?

31:17.160 --> 31:19.003
You don't think
that makes him dangerous?

31:19.400 --> 31:21.641
These guys always
talk a big game,

31:21.642 --> 31:23.599
but at the end of the day
they're mostly men

31:23.600 --> 31:25.329
who just like the sound
of their own voices.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.810
You want your story
and your Pulitzer Prize, huh?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.247
You haven't seen what they're
like when they come to us.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.359
Many are just girls.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.169
Frightened girls.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.842
Have you thought about what
your story might do to them?

31:39.843 --> 31:42.491
There are crimes
Federov is guilty of.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.684
He needs to be exposed.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.003
If the girls from your center
are willing to talk to me,

31:48.004 --> 31:50.523
- to tell me their stories...
- I help the victims.

31:50.524 --> 31:52.363
I don't use them for politics.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.482
These girls have
been through enough.

31:54.483 --> 31:57.006
I'm sorry. Maybe your heart's
in the right place,

31:57.007 --> 31:59.446
but nobody can stop Federov.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.005
You've agreed
to meet with me.

32:04.006 --> 32:06.048
There must be some way
you can help me.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.405
Excuse me.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.162
- Are you Alice Fournier?
- Yes.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.647
There is a call for you
in the office.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.048
They say your cell phone
is not working.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.087
- This way. Please.
- Excuse me.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.124
Oh.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.399
Yes? Hello?

32:27.400 --> 32:29.084
<i>Stop. Stay right
where you are.</i>

32:29.640 --> 32:31.285
Listen to me very carefully.

32:31.286 --> 32:33.362
<i>The woman you're with
is a killer.</i>

32:33.363 --> 32:35.999
<i>If she panics,
you're a dead woman.</i>

32:43.240 --> 32:45.439
<i>Turn around. Turn around.</i>

32:45.440 --> 32:48.125
<i>I'm right behind you.
Turn around.</i>

32:50.040 --> 32:53.919
Run! Now! Run!

32:53.920 --> 32:55.206
Alice?

32:57.360 --> 32:59.727
Out the back!
I want eyes on them!

33:16.800 --> 33:18.643
Come on! Come on!

33:21.200 --> 33:22.839
In here!

33:24.880 --> 33:26.245
Move!

33:29.640 --> 33:31.449
Who are you?
What's happening?!

33:33.360 --> 33:34.805
Side door.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.321
He's gotta be in the market!
I want eyes on him right now!

33:44.322 --> 33:46.721
Mason.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.079
I can't believe you still got
the same phone number.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.081
How's it going?

33:52.280 --> 33:53.999
Actually, I'm a little busy
right now.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.365
Can I call you back
in a few minutes?

33:55.366 --> 33:56.964
Get the cell scanner.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.122
<i>No, let's just talk, shall we?</i>

34:00.123 --> 34:01.882
You can keep doing
what you're doing.

34:01.883 --> 34:04.201
- I don't mind.
- Scenario: hard target

34:04.202 --> 34:06.679
with a female accomplice
took a 30-second lead on me

34:06.680 --> 34:09.079
- into a crowded venue.
- Mm-hmm.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.759
- Tell me about your target.
- Male, old.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.001
- Used to have skills.
- Used to?

34:15.159 --> 34:16.685
<i>Probably thinks he still does.</i>

34:18.480 --> 34:21.484
Yeah, he's arrogant,
confident he'll evade.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.449
<i>He's already made
his first mistake.</i>

34:23.719 --> 34:26.087
You really think six agents
are gonna do it?

34:26.440 --> 34:28.279
Hmm? Tell me.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.168
Devereaux. De...

34:46.920 --> 34:48.360
Who were those men,
were they police?

34:48.480 --> 34:50.402
No. Sort of.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.562
Then who the hell are you?
Who are you?! What do you want?!

34:54.719 --> 34:56.165
- Let go of me!
- Shh!

34:58.200 --> 34:59.804
What's happening?
I didn't do anything.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.883
I believe you, but they won't.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.965
Now if you wanna walk out of here,
you're gonna have to trust me. OK?

35:20.560 --> 35:22.403
Alice?

35:22.920 --> 35:24.251
Wait!

35:54.120 --> 35:55.884
- You OK?
- Yeah.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.526
- I knew you'd call back.
- You're losing your perimeter.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.843
Too many bodies moving.
You're losing control.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.600
Don't you wanna know why
I was in Moscow?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.483
What my orders were?
Who sent me?

36:16.640 --> 36:18.563
- Keep him talking.
- Why don't you come in,

36:18.564 --> 36:19.959
we'll talk about it.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.407
No. This is my scenario,
I make the rules.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.445
Come on, kid. Just give me enough
to keep it interesting.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.879
Maybe I'll make a mistake.
You owe me that much.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.565
- I don't owe you shit.
- Give me your phone.

36:32.566 --> 36:35.291
<i>Where am I?
Come on, Mason, where am I?</i>

36:35.800 --> 36:37.928
The call is being broadcast
through this phone.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.447
The scanner thinks Jake's phone
is Devereaux's phone.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.125
That's why he seems so close.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.408
How many people
have you killed, Mason?

36:44.560 --> 36:47.291
What, now?
Or in the next five minutes?

36:47.440 --> 36:49.124
You think about it sometimes?

36:49.280 --> 36:52.170
Maybe having a coffee,
or a screw.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.766
You see a beautiful woman
or a child,

36:55.240 --> 36:57.000
then you remember all the lives
you've taken.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.565
That way.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.722
<i>It stops you cold, doesn't it?</i>

37:00.723 --> 37:02.643
<i>No, asshole.
I sleep like</i> a <i>baby.</i>

37:03.600 --> 37:05.519
<i>I don't get you, Devereaux.</i>

37:05.520 --> 37:07.280
<i>I'm the one you want.
Why not take your shot?</i>

37:07.320 --> 37:09.199
Tempting.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.168
Give away my position, though.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.967
Always willing to die
for the cause, eh, Mason?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.965
Fear is the enemy,
you taught me that.

37:15.966 --> 37:18.884
<i>Yeah. Well, I haven't finished
teaching you yet, son.</i>

37:19.280 --> 37:21.521
Yet here I am about
to take you down all the same.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.489
You're not gonna take me down, kid.

37:23.490 --> 37:25.959
You're a blunt instrument at best.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.325
<i>No perspective, no knowledge.</i>

37:27.680 --> 37:30.879
- Keep talking, old man.
- This is humiliating.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.564
<i>Embarrassing.</i>

37:33.040 --> 37:34.883
Just like in Moscow.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.131
<i>Huh? Isn't it?
What is it, Mason?</i>

37:39.720 --> 37:42.166
No one there
to hold your hand?

37:42.960 --> 37:45.121
No one there to tell you
to pull the trigger?

37:47.040 --> 37:49.239
He's stealing a car.
Where's the nearest parking lot?

37:49.240 --> 37:50.680
There's one straight ahead,
this way.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.650
- So no regrets?
- Not one.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.085
And you know what?
I don't give a fuck

38:03.086 --> 38:04.605
about the people I've killed.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.884
If by some stroke of pure luck
you manage to kill me,

38:08.040 --> 38:10.088
then I won't give a fuck
about that either.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.402
He's here.
He's around here somewhere.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.409
<i>That was quite a speech.</i>

38:14.600 --> 38:16.807
You bring out the best in me.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.799
Gas, get back!

38:26.800 --> 38:28.928
Get back!
Get back!

38:42.920 --> 38:43.921
Fuck!

39:06.560 --> 39:09.803
Mira Filipova.
Where is she?

39:10.360 --> 39:11.805
How do you know that name?

39:11.960 --> 39:14.247
When was the last time
you saw her?

39:15.440 --> 39:19.001
I don't know. Maybe three years ago.
I was her case worker.

39:19.002 --> 39:21.731
A good friend of mine died
trying to find her.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.044
I'm sorry.
I have no idea where she is.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.409
The woman who approached you
at the restaurant,

39:27.410 --> 39:28.811
she was a professional killer.

39:28.812 --> 39:32.168
Russian. The men on
the motorbikes were CIA.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.322
- CIA?
- Now, whatever that girl knows,

39:34.323 --> 39:36.604
a lot of people want it.
And if they can't find her,

39:36.605 --> 39:38.364
you're the next closest thing.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.761
Do you have files
on the women you help?

39:43.720 --> 39:44.881
Yes.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.242
We gotta catch this tram.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.890
Why do you hate him so much?
The man who wants to kill us.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.086
Why do you hate him? Huh?

40:03.760 --> 40:05.205
I don't hate him.

40:06.680 --> 40:09.843
No. He's probably
the best friend I've ever had.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.086
So all your friends
try to kill you?

40:14.200 --> 40:15.486
Eventually.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.764
- Where can I find her?
- I told you, I don't know.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.965
You must know something.
Friends, places she frequented.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.363
- People don't just disappear.
- I don't know, OK?

40:55.520 --> 40:58.922
In my line of work, yes.
Yes, they do, they disappear.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.800
One day you think they're there,
the next they're just gone.

41:02.640 --> 41:05.007
Mm-hmm.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.965
She stopped coming to meetings.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.566
People said she was using,
doing tricks.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.124
Do you know who this man is?

41:12.880 --> 41:14.279
A pimp.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.602
He brings girls in from
the Caucasus, sells them for sex.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.445
- His name is Lebedynko.
- No.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.490
His real name is Simi Denisov.

41:23.800 --> 41:27.691
He was Federov's right-hand man
during the last Chechen conflict.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.730
You know where he is right now?

41:30.480 --> 41:31.925
Yes.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.522
He's here in Belgrade.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.122
How do you know Denisov?

41:47.120 --> 41:48.724
Just people you meet.

42:07.280 --> 42:10.762
- I'm here to see Lebedynko.
- No.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.921
Just tell him
Peter Devereaux's here.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.890
Wait.

42:24.960 --> 42:28.123
- Yeah, let him.
- Come on.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.839
- You look like shit.
- Yeah?

42:40.840 --> 42:42.365
Well, you don't
look too good yourself.

42:42.366 --> 42:43.805
Welcome.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.881
I can't believe it, Peter.

42:49.480 --> 42:53.963
- So, why are you here, Peter?
- I want information.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.969
Someone is here in Belgrade
to kill you and it's not me.

42:57.970 --> 43:01.839
I can tell you who it is,
but I want something in return.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.923
OK. You tell me.

43:05.600 --> 43:09.321
I go into your debt.
For old time's sake.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.882
Arkady Federov.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.122
He's killing just about everyone
who was close to him

43:17.320 --> 43:20.290
from your good old days.
Now my information is

43:20.440 --> 43:22.169
that he's gonna try and kill you.

43:22.170 --> 43:24.879
- Me?
- Yeah. So what's his deal?

43:24.880 --> 43:26.928
Why does he want to have
a clean slate now?

43:26.929 --> 43:28.331
What's his game?

43:30.200 --> 43:31.611
Turn around.

43:32.080 --> 43:34.003
You should turn around just now.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.929
Chechnya.

43:41.200 --> 43:45.599
This ugly, dirty, little
godforsaken country.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.321
Oil, however, lots of it.
Filthy Chechen terrorists

43:49.520 --> 43:51.124
didn't want to give it to us.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.443
So... one day,

43:54.600 --> 43:56.523
a building...

43:57.040 --> 43:59.691
...blew up.
Good Russian soldiers

43:59.840 --> 44:01.922
with mommies and daddies
back at home

44:02.080 --> 44:04.765
get sent back in pieces.

44:04.920 --> 44:08.845
And just like that,
Federov got his dirty little war

44:09.040 --> 44:12.567
and Mother Russia got its oil.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.123
- You dropped the building?
- No.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.009
Federov was smart enough to know

44:18.160 --> 44:21.403
that he couldn't handle
an operation like that,

44:21.600 --> 44:23.204
keep it a secret.

44:24.520 --> 44:27.842
- We ran it for you?
- It's to ask how.

44:28.320 --> 44:32.006
All we did was sit back
and watch everybody die.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.084
Would you like some water?

45:03.520 --> 45:05.329
Sorry about the treatment.

45:05.480 --> 45:07.482
If it makes a difference,
I argued against it.

45:11.720 --> 45:15.042
You ran Peter Devereaux from 1998

45:15.920 --> 45:18.571
until his retirement in 2008.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.731
On April 17th of this year,
you went to Lausanne

45:23.880 --> 45:27.930
under the name Sanders
and reactivated him.

45:28.600 --> 45:32.730
- Show me your tits.
- Excuse me?

45:32.800 --> 45:35.087
I assume that's why Weinstein
sent you, isn't it?

45:35.240 --> 45:37.641
It certainly isn't
for your acumen.

45:38.720 --> 45:41.559
- Fuck you.
- You like being on top?

45:41.560 --> 45:44.530
Working your way up the ladder?
I like the other guys better.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.285
Where the fuck are the other guys?

45:46.286 --> 45:49.011
- This room is soundproof.
- You don't think I know that?

45:49.480 --> 45:52.445
I approved the use and design
of this facility.

45:52.446 --> 45:54.283
I wrote the manual
you're going by.

45:54.480 --> 45:57.882
I know how long until you
switch operational procedure.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.929
You stupid twat.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.963
You may know the procedure,

46:03.920 --> 46:05.410
but then you also know
that I have the right

46:05.560 --> 46:07.722
to vary the procedure
if I deem it necessary.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.281
Based on the tenor
of this conversation,

46:10.440 --> 46:13.569
I am inclined to vary the procedure.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.365
<i>You know what?
I don't give a fuck</i>

46:16.520 --> 46:18.170
<i>about the people I've killed.</i>

46:18.640 --> 46:21.371
<i>If by some stroke of pure luck
you manage to kill me,</i>

46:21.520 --> 46:24.000
<i>then I won't give a fuck
about that either.</i>

46:24.280 --> 46:26.487
<i>That was quite a speech.</i>

46:26.640 --> 46:28.722
<i>You bring out
the best in me.</i>

46:31.200 --> 46:33.885
Not exactly accurate,
that last statement you made.

46:34.040 --> 46:36.088
Keeping him engaged
was an advantage, sir.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.049
Yes, to him.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.410
I don't know
if he's too in your head,

46:40.560 --> 46:42.324
and maybe you're mad because
you never had a daddy,

46:42.480 --> 46:44.005
I don't know,
and frankly I don't care.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.844
He played you for a fool.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.570
- I'll get him.
- Will you?

46:49.080 --> 46:50.764
It doesn't feel that way
from here, son,

46:50.920 --> 46:53.571
from here it feels like you're
busy trying to please him.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.484
What, you still admire the man?

46:57.640 --> 46:59.290
I did.

46:59.920 --> 47:03.402
Well... here's what
he thought of you.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.603
Hey, you. Hey!

48:40.520 --> 48:41.521
How'd you get in here?

48:48.560 --> 48:50.961
All she wants
is to be at your place.

48:50.962 --> 48:52.724
My God, you're
an ungrateful bitch!

48:52.880 --> 48:55.486
Mommy's gonna turn you
into a handbag.

48:55.640 --> 48:59.850
- OK, then.
- "OK, then?"

49:00.040 --> 49:02.686
What is that?
We've been passing each other

49:02.687 --> 49:04.125
On the stairs for eight weeks.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.489
Who are you anyway?

49:06.800 --> 49:10.639
I mean, sure, you're mildly
attractive and mysterious,

49:10.640 --> 49:13.928
but it gets kind of tired
after a while, you know?

49:14.080 --> 49:17.289
I mean, I don't even
know your name.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.365
David.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.604
Well, I'm Sarah.

49:42.520 --> 49:46.081
Did you ever think that maybe
Mira is better wherever she is?

49:47.160 --> 49:51.525
Your girl witnessed Federov and
a CIA agent conspire to start a war

49:51.526 --> 49:54.091
that killed hundreds
of thousands of people.

49:54.600 --> 49:59.447
So whoever gets to her first
owns Federov.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.087
And believe me...

50:02.240 --> 50:04.083
...someone will find her.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.130
Come on.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.843
What it must be like
to be you.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.721
Take what you want,
do as you please.

50:48.840 --> 50:50.842
What happens if they come back?

50:51.280 --> 50:53.203
We leave.

50:55.480 --> 50:59.007
There you go.
That'll do.

51:12.040 --> 51:13.610
Bottoms up.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.529
What happened in Moscow?

51:42.960 --> 51:44.291
Something...

51:46.320 --> 51:48.402
...unfortunate.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.728
What was her name?

51:55.280 --> 51:56.930
Natalia.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.681
Will killing him
really make it better?

52:09.480 --> 52:12.131
Ah... it's a start.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.329
Why did you save me?

52:19.720 --> 52:22.041
Don't put your faith
in me, Alice.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.242
I promise...

52:24.760 --> 52:26.364
...I'll disappoint you.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.523
Satie.

53:52.280 --> 53:54.169
What did you say?

53:56.680 --> 53:58.762
It means "my favorite"
in Russian.

54:01.640 --> 54:05.122
- You speak Russian.
- Yes.

54:06.760 --> 54:10.359
My parents were
university professors.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.169
They taught me.

56:06.480 --> 56:09.324
I found some clothes
that should fit you.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.522
What if they find Mira
before you do?

56:13.720 --> 56:16.929
Then no one will need you.
Your problems will be over.

56:20.040 --> 56:23.328
- They'll kill her, won't they?
- Yes.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.087
What if no one ever finds her?

56:32.560 --> 56:34.961
No one can hide forever.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.651
I can't bring you with me
where I have to go now.

56:39.440 --> 56:41.442
So I can't protect you anymore.

56:42.040 --> 56:45.567
Go somewhere where no one
can find you. Not even me.

56:45.568 --> 56:49.042
Use only cash,
and wait for this to ring.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.604
Sarah?

57:20.240 --> 57:22.163
Sarah.

58:14.320 --> 58:16.129
Sarah?

58:31.040 --> 58:33.725
- David?
- I'm here.

58:35.640 --> 58:37.130
It's all right.

58:37.640 --> 58:39.046
Everything's gonna be all right.

58:39.047 --> 58:40.724
He won't hurt you.
Understand?

58:45.000 --> 58:48.447
- Let her go.
- "Let her go."

58:49.920 --> 58:52.764
And you? What?

58:53.200 --> 58:54.884
Bullets start bouncing around?

58:55.360 --> 58:58.489
Tell him he needs to listen.
Tell him.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.806
You need to listen.

59:06.360 --> 59:08.442
You know what he's doing,
don't you?

59:09.320 --> 59:11.163
He's trying to decide
what you're worth.

59:11.164 --> 59:12.924
He will not hurt you.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.288
He still hasn't decided.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.040
Ask him.

59:18.520 --> 59:21.000
Ask him if you're worth saving.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.645
Am I worth saving?

59:29.000 --> 59:31.367
He's not answering
your question, is he?!

59:31.520 --> 59:35.525
You need to make him
answer your question!

59:36.000 --> 59:38.401
- Am l worth saving?!
- Yes!

59:39.520 --> 59:41.363
You are!

59:44.840 --> 59:46.359
You are.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.759
- You like her, huh?
- Yeah.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.799
Time to finish your training.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.689
What the fuck
can you teach me?

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.161
- You gave up on me, remember?
- What did you want?

01:00:08.162 --> 01:00:09.402
I wanted to be better than you!

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.409
What does that mean?

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.201
To be better than me?
Be better at something, hmm?

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.370
- To be a better man?
- Why did you drop me?

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.279
Oh, here it comes.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.851
I took the shot. What was I
supposed to do? I had no choice!

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.561
- There's always a choice!
- Answer the fucking question!

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.607
You made the wrong choice.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.286
I came here tonight, Mason,
to kill you.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.841
I did not know
what she was to you.

01:00:42.842 --> 01:00:45.319
Oh, you thought
this was about Natalia?

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.243
No, this is about you.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.248
You can be a human...

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.969
or a killer of humans,
but not both.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.000
Eventually, one of those people
will extinguish the other one.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.770
All you have to do now
is just to show me...

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.759
...that it's not too late for you.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.080
- Come on!
- No!

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.131
Second chance, Mason.
Scenario...

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.567
- No!
- Your target has just severed

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.131
the femoral artery of a woman.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.446
- No!
- David!

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.681
Has just severed the femoral artery

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:27.160
of a woman
you have been intimate with!

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.561
- What do you do?
- Let her go!

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.084
Fuck!

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.644
Celia, do you want to know
what I did?

01:01:53.645 --> 01:01:56.325
I know what you did, Mr. Hanley.
We're discussing why.

01:01:56.326 --> 01:01:59.439
No, you don't know
what I did or what I do.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.047
Ergo, how the fuck could you
possibly comprehend why?

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.007
- Let's start at the top.
- Look, what do you think

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.202
it is we do here at the agency?

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.044
- We collect information.
- No. Information is useless.

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:15.327
That changes overnight.
Knowledge isn't power.

01:02:15.328 --> 01:02:18.449
People are power!
We collect people!

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.361
And if anyone's listening at Langley,

01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:24.202
with half a brain in their head,
they know what I'm talking about!

01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:27.568
I'm talking about
the ownership of Arkady Federov!

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.288
Are you listening?!
Arkady Federov!

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.200
Sir, welcome
to the Hotel Imperial.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.041
- Edgar.
- Alice.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.883
What are you doing here?
Are you all right?

01:03:15.884 --> 01:03:17.609
What happened to you
at the restaurant?

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.766
I decided to tell you everything
I know about Arkady Federov.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.884
Come in.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.241
You know he's in town right now
for a European energy conference.

01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:32.881
- Staying at the Imperial Hotel.
- No, I didn't.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.003
I'm surprised to see you.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.367
Can I get you a drink?
A cup of coffee or something?

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.568
No, thank you.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.451
That's my wall of shame.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.251
There were hundreds of girls
that came out of the conflict.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.931
- We're a small organization.
- Let me get my Dictaphone.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.522
There was one girl, Mira.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.127
Pretended she was a mute.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.888
Federov... liked her.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.329
Kept her close to him.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.641
Like a pet.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.731
Mason, David. Access code:
three-niner-zero-four-two.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.003
- Get in the corner.
- Leave the poor girl alone.

01:06:50.004 --> 01:06:51.126
What the fuck...

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.287
Natalia didn't expect
to see me in Moscow.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.529
She didn't even know
I was coming!

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.683
- What did you do?
- She was...

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.159
...these past few months,
she was acting erratically.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.600
Analysts thought she was becoming...

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.319
- Bullshit!
- It happens!

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.368
So they decided to pull her.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.130
I couldn't get to her
without them knowing.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.008
If she came to our side,
she was going to die.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.322
Sending you was her only chance.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.801
Why, huh?

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.559
- Why?
- Agency suspected for years

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.530
that Federov started the war
by dropping the building

01:07:31.531 --> 01:07:33.045
on his own men,

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.600
then blaming it on
the Chechen nationalists.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.204
Then Natalia reaches out to me.
Says she's got an eyewitness,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.125
who will swear that Federov
was involved.

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:44.849
We did it!

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.329
We did it!

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.205
Who the fuck you been talking to?

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.926
People you should have been
talking to!

01:07:52.927 --> 01:07:55.844
Who was it on our side?
Now don't fucking lie to me!

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.327
The same man who picked up
Natalia's mayday demand.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.687
The same man who ordered
her extraction.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.050
And the same man who
quarterbacked the hit on her.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.365
Come in.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.962
Devereaux has a daughter.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.884
Her name's Lucy.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.242
These pictures are from
five years ago.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.129
She'd be 12 by now.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.720
Natalia Ulanova was her mother.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.528
And Devereaux raises her.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.759
When Devereaux was in Berlin,
he recruited Natalia,

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.569
convinced her to spy for us.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.564
He had a whole goddamn family
hidden from all of us.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.682
Mira can destroy Weinstein.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.162
That's why he had Mason
kill Natalia.

01:08:54.162 --> 01:08:56.002
That's why he's going after Mira.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.450
The girl wasn't a peasant
or a mute.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.611
Both her parents
were university professors.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.639
She could speak English
and Russian.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.484
Everything that Federov said
she understood.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.402
- I'm here to see Lebedynko.
- Your bag.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.444
Hands up, please.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.559
Why are you here?

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.801
Peter Devereaux needs a big favor.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.640
- What do you got?
- This woman.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:54.409
Alice Fournier, deceased.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.361
April 2005. Cancer.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.721
Then who is she? She was in
the restaurant with Devereaux.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.448
I'll run a biometric match.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.801
Welcome to Hotel Imperial.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.686
<i>- Peter'?
- Where are you?</i>

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.122
- I'm going to visit Arkady Federov.
- Are you insane?

01:10:43.123 --> 01:10:44.845
I've made the decision
to confront him.

01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:47.002
<i>This is suicide.
He will kill you.</i>

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.931
<i>Don't be foolish!
Mira? Mira!</i>

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.726
Who are you?

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.291
I'm the gift from Simi Denisov.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.209
What's this for?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.765
OK. Upstairs.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.039
Come in.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.201
Turn around.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.770
Denisov is very generous.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.204
- Get in the bed.
- I'd like to wash first.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.199
I have an audio file match.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.725
Label's been changed.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.083
Border intake interview.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.805
<i>My name is Mira Filipova.</i>

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.122
<i>My parents were murdered
by the Russian general,</i>

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.608
<i>Arkady Federov.</i>

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.565
<i>I survived.</i>

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.121
Arkady Federov
is in Belgrade right now

01:13:45.122 --> 01:13:46.610
for an energy conference.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.970
Find out where he's staying.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.010
- You are not going to kill me.
- You're wrong.

01:15:54.011 --> 01:15:55.759
No.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.321
If you were,
I'd already be dead.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.246
You don't know what
you're doing, do you?

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.130
This is for my family.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.203
Oh, my God.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.731
Mira.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.359
So many people
who want me dead.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.203
And yet here you are.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.527
The angry little girl

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.521
who didn't know
how to fuck.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.209
- And now we talk.
- Shut up!

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:40.399
OK, OK.
Maybe you will kill me.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.243
We will see.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.999
But making you into a woman...

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.559
It is one of the sweetest
memories I carry with me.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.805
Shut up!

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.486
Did you forget who I am? Huh?

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.721
Mira! Mira, don't!
Don't do it.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.042
- I want him to die.
- He will.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.801
But once he tells
the world what he did.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.885
Where's your phone?
Get it.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.762
Go get it now!
Start filming.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.809
Nineteen ninety-nine.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.604
You supported an American operation

01:18:16.605 --> 01:18:18.602
to impersonate Chechen terrorists.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.162
Who was the American agent
who ran it?

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.962
You are sit on my shirt.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.206
Mira, take this.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.646
Shoot him if you have to.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.643
You are not going to kill me.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.849
That's for you to decide.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.602
We're gonna play a little game

01:18:54.603 --> 01:18:56.602
that I believe was invented
in your country.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.286
I'll ask you once more.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.524
Who was the American agent?

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.889
I'll ask you again.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.010
Was it Weinstein? Hmm?

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.930
Come on!

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.601
The stairs.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.559
You piece of shit!

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.007
Your odds are running out.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.047
Who was the American agent?

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.648
Was it Weinstein?

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.330
Hanley.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.608
John Hanley.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.607
- Hanley?
- Yeah.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.799
Was it this guy?
The guy in the middle?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.847
No.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.565
Peter.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.719
That's him.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.449
The bald guy.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.039
Shh, shh.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.203
Go. Here you go, take this.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.282
- Use the service elevator.
- What about you?

01:21:07.283 --> 01:21:08.882
Check into the Hyatt Hotel.

01:21:08.883 --> 01:21:10.802
If I don't turn up,
go to the Dutch embassy.

01:21:10.803 --> 01:21:13.004
Identify yourself
and tell them everything.

01:21:13.005 --> 01:21:14.843
- Ask for asylum. Go.
- OK.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:04.043
- He's heading to the basement.
- Repeat that.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:06.042
<i>He's gotta be heading
to the basement.</i>

01:22:06.043 --> 01:22:08.611
<i>- Cover the back stairs.
- Traveling.</i>

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.086
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.085
You go that way.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.847
Check this out.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.491
- Jesus.
- You need to see something.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.448
<i>Who was the American agent?</i>

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.210
<i>Was it Weinstein?</i>

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.050
<i>Hanley.</i>

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.086
- John...
- This is messed up.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.439
<i>...Hanley.</i>

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.522
We're taking this
to Weinstein right now.

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.688
You, stay.
Tits, back to your desk.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.405
Sit.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.325
You know who sits here?

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.802
Your boss sits here.
I'm sitting here.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.884
So sit down.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.324
Peter?

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.090
Thank God you're alive.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.644
What happened?

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.730
You can disappear.
I'll help you.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.850
Name a city, I'll get you there.
I have contacts.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.249
People who can help you start again.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.200
People who can make sure
you'll never be found.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.288
I'm not running ever again.

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.925
Running is better than dead.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.161
Thank you, Peter,
for saving my life.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.728
Letting you die
was never an option.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:39.004
Come on.
We've gotta get moving.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.009
A lot has changed
in a very short time.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.851
What were you doing a week ago?

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:52.242
Living my life.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.486
What's in Peter Devereaux's life?

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.889
Simple things.

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.850
A home in Lausanne.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.444
A small business.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.808
It's a cafe by a lake.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.811
And a daughter...

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.004
...who never got to know
her mother,

01:27:17.005 --> 01:27:18.764
and who barely knows her father.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.687
- What's her name?
- Lucy.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.205
She's 12.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.364
Where is she now?

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.202
Waiting for her father to pick
her up from boarding school.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.482
<i>- Lucy?</i>
- Never had you pegged

01:27:45.483 --> 01:27:48.848
for the father type, Peter.
That such a lovely little girl

01:27:48.849 --> 01:27:51.650
<i>could come from your DNA
defies logic.</i>

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.561
Really, you should say something.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.764
I'll kill you.

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.559
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.685
Funny thing, Peter.
Turns out the keys to Federov

01:28:07.686 --> 01:28:10.001
are worth more to Langley
than any qualms

01:28:10.002 --> 01:28:11.922
Weinstein had with my methods.

01:28:11.923 --> 01:28:13.888
<i>I'm running the show here now, Peter.</i>

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:16.008
<i>Weinstein's back in the States.</i>

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.690
He seemed surprised
when they sent him home.

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.084
But not as surprised
as you probably are right now.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.882
You know,
if it's any consolation,

01:28:27.883 --> 01:28:30.360
it was your boy, Mason,
who brought Lucy in for me.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.281
<i>I just thought, well,
you should be proud.</i>

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.159
<i>He did good, didn't he?</i>

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.401
Found that soft underbelly.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.844
Wasn't sure you had one.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.279
Yeah. The boy did good.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.805
<i>OK, the fortress.</i>

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.408
Eight a.m.
Where they play chess?

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.970
You bring me Mira,
I'll give you your daughter.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.719
You're a weapon, Mason.
A damn good one.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:06.722
I value that.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.728
We gotta get out of here right now.

01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:12.359
Go to the train station.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.282
Book three tickets on
the noon train to Junik.

01:29:14.283 --> 01:29:15.519
The border there is weak.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:17.005
He doesn't want you,
he wants me.

01:29:17.006 --> 01:29:18.206
We'll meet you there.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.804
- We'll be there!
- And if you're not?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.088
Then I guess I didn't make it.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.291
They're gonna kill us all.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.646
How would it happen?

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.370
You don't feel anything.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.610
How can you be so sure?

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:50.488
A bullet travels at over
4,000 feet per second.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.085
Four times faster
than the speed of sound.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.519
The effect of that velocity

01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.684
is... absolute.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.051
You just...

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.730
...cease to exist.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.889
Just be there, please.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.603
<i>Attention, please.
The train from Chardok</i>

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:46.080
<i>is late by one hour.</i>

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:54.924
You tell yourself
no one's gonna get hurt.

01:30:54.925 --> 01:30:56.843
At least no one you care about.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.846
- You played it well, though.
- Did I?

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.042
You know what Federov's
going to do

01:31:07.043 --> 01:31:08.929
when he secures the presidency?

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.369
Change the world.

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.719
Russia's gonna join fucking NATO.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.165
Why?

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:21.966
Because I got my hand so far up
his ass, I'm moving his lips.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.650
I own him.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:28.371
This is what we worked for
all those years.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.730
You know it is.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.926
Yeah, I think I got something
for you here.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.319
Yes, she's at train station.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.046
Just bought three tickets to
Junik with a credit card.

01:32:22.047 --> 01:32:24.327
- She should be there.
- Thank you.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.529
You think, maybe...

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.365
...just maybe you might
have crossed the line with this?

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.167
A long time ago, my friend.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.411
You'll need proof of life,
of course.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.279
- Hello.
- Your father.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.647
Papa? Is that you?

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.730
<i>How you doing, kiddo?</i>

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.284
<i>I know you're scared.</i>

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.447
But everything's gonna be
all right, I promise you.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.647
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.523
<i>And tell you I love you more
than anything in this world.</i>

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.368
I love you too, Papa.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.411
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:26.371
OK. Where's Mira Filipova?

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:37.647
Bus station.
Bus to Novi Sad, nine a.m.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:44.847
Bus station. Bus to Novi Sad,
nine a.m. Bring her in.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.924
Jones, you go with him.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.639
You misjudged the kid.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.723
He's a survivor.
Not like you.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.844
No.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.447
We bring Mira in,
you have my word,

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.884
you'll have your daughter back.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.201
You know what we
used to call you, Peter?

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.088
The November Man.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.603
'Cause after
you passed through,

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.051
nothing lived.

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.203
You are one bleak
motherfucker, my friend.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.247
- Bus station is that way.
- Shortcut.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.841
Slow down.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.088
- Slow the fucking car down!
- Seatbelt.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.684
Stop the vehicle, right now!

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.645
Wall.

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.204
- Mason, you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.159
Not one American life was lost
in that Chechen mess. Not one.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.767
- Oh, you're right.
- East versus West. Fuck that.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.446
From now on,
it's the civilized world

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.601
against the goddamn Middle East.

01:38:02.602 --> 01:38:04.682
Now, that's a fight
I can understand.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.723
That's a fight we can win.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.691
Don't you get it?

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.002
- Hanley.
- What?

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.209
- Why are you sweating?
- 'Cause it's fucking hot.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.606
Excuse me.
I'm still using this station.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.845
Thank you.

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.366
Where's Lucy? You were supposed
to bring her here

01:39:48.367 --> 01:39:51.569
- when it was done.
- It is.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.006
You just doomed us to another
decade of conflict. Of shit!

01:40:18.007 --> 01:40:19.525
I hope you know that!

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.169
The thing is,
I like it this way.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.329
Thank you.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.651
Papa!

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.044
Where is she?

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.724
Where is she?

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.887
- Peter!
- There she is.

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.321
Let's catch a train.
Come on.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.167
<i>My name is Mira Filipova.</i>

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.605
When I was 15 years old,

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.766
Arkady Federov murdered my family,

01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.487
and held me captive for two years.

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.965
I was repeatedly abused by him.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.479
During that time,

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.485
I witnessed Federov conspire
with CIA agent John Hanley

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.129
to bomb a civilian building.

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.207
That bombing was the start
of the second Chechen war.

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.887
<i>The revelations of Chechnyan refugee</i>

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.324
<i>Mira Filipova rocked
the political world as evidence</i>

01:42:22.325 --> 01:42:24.607
<i>of a conspiracy
between Arkady Federov</i>

01:42:24.608 --> 01:42:26.919
<i>and a high-ranking CIA official</i>

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.999
<i>effectively ended
Arkady Federov's candidacy</i>

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.923
<i>for the Russian presidency.</i>

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.123
<i>The Russian Energy Minister's office</i>

01:42:35.124 --> 01:42:38.279
<i>issued a blank denial
of all accusations</i>

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.599
<i>as Arkady Federov takes
an extended leave from his office</i>

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.206
<i>while weighing his political options.</i>
