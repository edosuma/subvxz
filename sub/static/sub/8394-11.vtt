07:26.130 --> 07:31.261
- ZEEK, IT WAS SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL DAY HERE TODAY.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.130
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THE SUNSET LAST NIGHT.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.649
I WISHED YOU WERE HERE.

07:34.690 --> 07:37.796
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU.

07:37.830 --> 07:39.513

OH, FINE, FINE, YEAH.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.073

07:46.120 --> 07:49.078
- UH, WELL,
SHE'S DOING GOOD, YOU KNOW.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.088
I'M WORKING ON HER ALL THE TIME,
AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY--

07:51.120 --> 07:53.156
- WELL, IT WORKED OUT THEN,
DIDN'T IT?

07:53.190 --> 07:56.637
WE'RE BOTH PURSUING
OUR PASSIONS.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.501
- YEAH, IT DID.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.100
- LISTEN, THERE'S A GAL
IN OUR GROUP

08:02.130 --> 08:04.269
WHO'S GOT A LITTLE VILLA
OUTSIDE TUSCANY,

08:04.310 --> 08:07.859
AND SHE INVITED A FEW OF US
TO COME THERE AND PAINT.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.720
IT'S JUST A WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITY,

08:09.760 --> 08:12.103
AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'D HAVE THE CHANCE AGAIN,

08:12.140 --> 08:17.168
BUT IT WOULD MEAN EXTENDING
MY TRIP A WEEK.

08:17.220 --> 08:21.247
SO I'LL--
I'LL LET YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

08:21.290 --> 08:24.521
- OKAY. YEAH. YEAH.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.083

WEAR JEANS?

08:26.120 --> 08:28.680
- NO, YOU CANNOT WEAR JEANS.

08:28.710 --> 08:29.847
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
ALL THESE AWESOME DRESSES?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.916
THIS IS AN AMAZING WARDROBE.
- I THINK THAT WOULD LOOK

08:31.950 --> 08:32.917
REALLY GOOD ON YOU.
- REALLY?

08:32.960 --> 08:33.949
- YEAH.

HEY, UM, WHAT'S THIS GUY'S
LAST NAME AGAIN?

WHY?

08:38.690 --> 08:39.850
- OKAY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:39.890 --> 08:40.857
- LOOKIN' HIM UP.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:40.890 --> 08:42.061
- I'M LOOKING HIM UP.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.749

08:43.790 --> 08:45.610
I'M SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT THAT.

08:45.660 --> 08:48.060
IT'S TACKY AND STALKER-Y.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.247

08:49.280 --> 08:52.215

SO WE HAVE TO LOOK HIM UP

08:52.250 --> 08:53.899
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THIS GUY.

08:53.940 --> 08:54.861
AND YOU SHOULD WEAR
THE BLACK ONE.

08:54.910 --> 08:55.877
IT'S GONNA LOOK AMAZING.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.798
- I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AMAZING.
- WHY NOT?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.046
- JASMINE,
IT'S NOT A DATE.

08:59.090 --> 09:02.082
I'M JUST GOING WITH THIS GUY
TO--FOR NETWORKING REASONS,

09:02.120 --> 09:05.055
AND BECAUSE HE ASKED ME
TO BE HIS PLUS-ONE,

09:05.090 --> 09:06.318
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
"WHO CARES?"

09:06.370 --> 09:08.645

09:22.140 --> 09:24.347
AND CLINICS
IN UNDERPRIVILEGED COUNTRIES."

09:24.390 --> 09:25.414
- BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH--

09:25.460 --> 09:27.837
- WELL, YEAH, IT IS,
BECAUSE HE IS THE CHAIRMAN

09:27.870 --> 09:32.113
AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF IT.
HE WENT TO DUKE,

09:32.150 --> 09:33.970
COLUMBIA MED SCHOOL--
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.329

09:36.360 --> 09:38.180
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
- NO, HE--

09:38.230 --> 09:41.154
- HE'S A DOCTOR?
- AND HE SAVES BABIES.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.122
- UH, THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A MAJOR EVENING.

09:45.370 --> 09:47.122
- I BE'I'I'ER TRY THE BLACK ONE.

LISTEN, I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

10:04.810 --> 10:07.768
TO YOU FOR MAX'S BLOWUP
THE OTHER DAY.

10:07.810 --> 10:08.799
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- YEAH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

10:08.840 --> 10:12.219
HOW IS HE--HE'S OKAY?
IS HE MAD AT ME STILL?

10:12.260 --> 10:13.909
- YEAH.

10:13.950 --> 10:15.770
- UNFORTUNATELY,
MAX CAN BE KIND OF STUBBORN.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.299
BUT YOU HANDLED THE SITUATION
REALLY WELL, SO--

10:17.340 --> 10:18.227
- YEAH, HE--
BUT HE DOES THAT, HUH?

10:18.270 --> 10:20.363
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:20.410 --> 10:22.162
- HE GOT IT INTO HIS HEAD
THAT YOU LIED TO HIM,

10:22.200 --> 10:23.827
WHICH I'M SURE
ISN'T TRUE, AND--

10:23.860 --> 10:25.373
- [sighs] YEAH, NO, I--
- IT'S TYPICAL OF MAX

10:25.410 --> 10:26.820
THAT HE CAN'T LET THINGS GO.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.963
SO IT'S IRRATIONAL,
IT'S FRUSTRATING...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.752
- YEAH, NO, I KNOW.
- BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

10:29.800 --> 10:30.869
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

10:30.900 --> 10:31.969
- NO, I DON'T.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

10:32.010 --> 10:36.720
TO BE HONEST, I DID
BREAK A PROMISE TO HIM, SO--

10:36.770 --> 10:38.351
- WELL, THAT HAPPENS.
- YEAH.

10:38.390 --> 10:40.187
- AND HE NEEDS TO LEARN
HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.972
- YEAH.
- AND I BROUGHT YOU

10:42.020 --> 10:42.975
THIS BOOK
ON ASPERGER'S SYNDROME.

10:43.020 --> 10:44.112
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE TIME
TO READ IT,

10:44.160 --> 10:46.185
BUT IT MIGHT HELP UNDERSTAND
MAX A LITTLE BIT BE'I'I'ER,

10:46.230 --> 10:49.256
BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT THIS
TO WORK OUT HERE.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.052
I MEAN, WE LOVE
THAT HE COMES HERE.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.125
IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD FOR HIM.
- YEAH, NO, I KNOW, I KNOW.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.263
RELAX.
- OKAY.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.928
I MEAN, I'M--I LIKE HIM.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.439
SO IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED,
REALLY.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.549
- OKAY, GOOD.
- YEAH.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.332
IF YOU WANT TO, HOPEFULLY,
IT'LL BE OF SOME HELP.

11:00.380 --> 11:03.133
- YEAH, SURE.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.376
AND SHE STARTED
TO TELL ME ABOUT IT,

17:19.410 --> 17:21.230
AND SHE GOT REALLY UPSET.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.726
SO ED IS GONNA BE

18:19.370 --> 18:21.918
HE WAS, LIKE, A HUGE MUSIC NERD
LIKE DREW.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.542

I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT.
I NEED ALCOHOL,

19:34.030 --> 19:35.782
ANYTHING WITH ALCOHOL IN IT.
- OKAY.

19:35.820 --> 19:36.718

NOTHING.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.512
NOT A BEER, NOT ONE SINGLE BEER.

19:38.550 --> 19:39.960

BUT HOLD ON.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.444

19:56.710 --> 19:59.702
TRADING BASEBALL CARDS,
AND I FLIPPED OUT.

19:59.750 --> 20:00.637
I MEAN, I FLIPPED THE HELL OUT
ON THIS KID.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.739
- WHAT'S THAT BOOK?
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

20:02.780 --> 20:04.919

20:04.960 --> 20:07.713
I'M READING IT FOR THE KID,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

20:07.750 --> 20:09.433
I'M NOT READING

20:09.480 --> 20:11.926
I'M READING ABOUT ME.
THIS BOOK IS DESCRIBING ME.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.234

ON THE NAPA TRIP

26:51.230 --> 26:53.425
AFTER THE BIDDING WAS CLOSED.
- OKAY.

26:53.470 --> 26:55.392
- THERE ARE RULES IN PLACE...
- YOU MIGHT BE BEING DRAMATIC.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.089
- AT THIS EVENT.

26:57.130 --> 26:59.223
IF THE RULES ARE NOT FOLLOWED,
IT IS CHAOS.

26:59.270 --> 27:01.921
- [low conversation]

27:01.960 --> 27:04.929
THAT HAS EVER EXISTED.
- WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME, OKAY?

27:04.960 --> 27:06.962
'CAUSE YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT COLLEEN, AND YOU'RE--

27:07.000 --> 27:08.228
- NO, I'M NOT--
I'M UPSET ABOUT YOU.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.168
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

27:10.210 --> 27:11.279
- DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I'M UPSET ABOUT.

27:11.310 --> 27:14.450
- I-I-I CAN'T. I'M SORRY, ED.
- COME ON--JULIA--

27:14.490 --> 27:17.175
- THAT YOU ARE PLAYING
FAST AND LOOSE--

27:17.220 --> 27:18.938
- CAN YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND?

27:18.980 --> 27:21.039
YOU CAN YELL AT ME
RIGHT WHEN I GET BACK, OKAY?

27:21.080 --> 27:22.354
- ED, I DON'T--
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

27:22.390 --> 27:24.142
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.
- YEAH, JOEL.

27:24.190 --> 27:26.351
WHAT'S UP?
- ED IS GOING HOME.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.674
- YOUR WIFE IS AWESOME.
- SHE IS, YEAH.

27:27.710 --> 27:29.223
AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.672
- WE'RE TOTALLY CHILL.
WE'RE JUST--

27:31.710 --> 27:33.849
DID YOU AUCTION ON ANYTHING?
DID YOU BUY ANYTHING?

27:33.890 --> 27:34.640
'CAUSE THERE IS
SOME GOOD STUFF HERE.

27:34.680 --> 27:35.851
- OKAY.
- LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.

27:35.890 --> 27:36.879
- NO, I'M GOOD,
I'M HAVING FUN.

27:36.930 --> 27:38.409
I'M NOT READY TO CALL ANY--
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.475
YOU'RE DRUNK,
AND YOU'RE BOTHERING MY WIFE.

27:39.510 --> 27:41.785
- I'M NOT BOTHERING HER.
YOU NEED TO JUST RELAX.

27:41.830 --> 27:42.785
TRUST ME.
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

27:42.830 --> 27:44.138
- HEY! WHOA!
[people gasping]

27:44.170 --> 27:46.206
- JOEL, JOEL, JOEL, JOEL, JOEL.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.797
- DUDE, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

27:47.830 --> 27:50.219
- STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.218
- [chuckles]
- OKAY.

27:52.250 --> 27:56.072
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.350
NOT A BIG DEAL.
EVERYONE'S HORSING AROUND.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.016
GO BACK TO THE PARTY.
STILL BIDDING HERE.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.189
COME ON, LET'S GO.
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

28:09.170 --> 28:12.196
- EIGHT BALL, SIDE POCKET.
- YOU WISH.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.856
- RATHER SIMPLE.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.822
AND THAT WOULD DO IT,
I THINK.

28:17.860 --> 28:18.895
[both chuckling]

28:18.930 --> 28:22.388
- LUCKY.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28:22.420 --> 28:23.170
I'LL BUY YOU A BEER. COME ON.
- YEAH.

28:23.210 --> 28:25.838
- CAN WE GET TWO MORE,
PLEASE?

28:25.870 --> 28:27.838
- SO WHEN DID YOU LOSE HER?

28:27.870 --> 28:28.859
- LOSE WHO?

28:28.910 --> 28:31.970
- YOUR WIFE.
MINE WAS IN '99.

28:32.020 --> 28:34.488
- I DIDN'T LOSE MY WIFE.
MY WIFE'S NOT DEAD.

28:34.540 --> 28:35.768
WHAT MADE YOU THINK THAT,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD?

28:35.810 --> 28:37.801
- SORRY.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.535
I GUESS I JUST ASSUMED.
- ASSUMED WHAT?

28:40.580 --> 28:43.469
- THAT YOU WERE A LONELY-HEARTS
WIDOWER LIKE ME.

28:43.510 --> 28:45.296
- I'M NOT
A LONELY-HEARTS WIDO--

28:45.340 --> 28:49.856
MY WIFE HAPPENS TO BE IN ITALY
ON A TRIP WITH HER ART CLASS,

28:49.900 --> 28:52.960
AND THEY'RE SEEING MUSEUMS
AND TOUCHING STATUES.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.174
THEY'RE GOING ALL AROUND
SPENDING MY MONEY,

28:56.210 --> 28:57.791
THAT'S WHAT TH EY'RE--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL

28:57.830 --> 28:58.933
THEY'RE DOING OVER THERE.

28:58.970 --> 29:02.246
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
A LITTLE PERTURBED ABOUT THAT.

29:02.290 --> 29:04.008
- WELL, I'M A LITTLE PERTURBED,
YEAH.

29:04.050 --> 29:07.804
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS.
I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD MEAL,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.398
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY CLEAN UNDERWEAR.

29:09.430 --> 29:12.297
I MEAN, COME ON. YOU KNOW?
AND THEN SHE JUST TOLD ME

29:12.330 --> 29:14.912
SHE WANTS TO STAY AN EXTRA WEEK.
I MEAN, GOD.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.191
- [laughs]
TYPICAL ARMY.

29:18.230 --> 29:21.506
CAN'T SEE THE FOREST
FOR THE TREES.

29:21.550 --> 29:24.439
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:24.480 --> 29:27.517
- MOST WOMEN OUR AGE
ARE A PAIN IN THE ASS.

29:27.550 --> 29:28.539
MANY JUST WANT TO SIT AROUND
PLAYING CARDS

29:28.590 --> 29:32.071
OR SHOWING YOU PICTURES
OF THEIR GRANDKIDS.

29:32.110 --> 29:35.489
THEY SIT THERE YAMMERING ABOUT
"MY HEARING AID THIS,"

29:35.530 --> 29:37.009
AND, "MY ARTIFICIAL HIP THAT."
IT'S ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

29:37.050 --> 29:42.329
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
CAMILLE ISN'T THAT WAY AT ALL.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.227
- THEN BE THANKFUL.

29:47.540 --> 29:50.293
I'M TELLING YOU,
IF MY WIFE WAS STILL ALIVE,

29:50.340 --> 29:53.889
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO TAKE A TRIP TO ITALY,

29:53.930 --> 29:58.264
I'D BUY TWO FIRST-CLASS TICKETS
AND BEAT HER ASS TO THE AIRPORT.

30:00.310 --> 30:03.029
BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.548
- AND NOW FOR THE HIGHLIGHT
OF OUR EVENING.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.070

30:21.440 --> 30:25.194
- WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU ABOUT TO GET AN AWARD?

30:25.230 --> 30:27.289
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S NOTHING.

30:27.340 --> 30:30.400

OH, THIS IS NICE.

30:48.950 --> 30:52.568
WELL, I AM TERRIBLE AT SPEECHES,
BUT I'LL JUST SAY TWO THINGS.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.012
FIRST,
IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD,

30:55.060 --> 30:58.575
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS AN INDIVIDUAL AWARD.

30:58.610 --> 31:01.602
GLOBAL MED
IS A TOTAL TEAM EFFORT,

31:01.650 --> 31:02.924
AND I'D LIKE TO THANK

31:02.960 --> 31:06.191
MY BRILLIANTLY TALENTED
EXECUTIVE STAFF.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.959

STAND UP, GUYS.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.992
[applause]

31:12.040 --> 31:15.009
THANK YOU.
THESE THREE MAKE IT HAPPEN.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.621
THEY'RE THE REASON
GLOBAL MED WORKS.

31:16.660 --> 31:20.357
SECOND, I WANT TO THANK YOU,
BECAUSE WITHOUT YOUR HELP...

31:22.050 --> 31:25.087
- [laughing] OH, MY GOD,
YOUR FRIEND NATALIE

31:25.120 --> 31:27.327
WAS SO WASTED.
- YEAH, SHE WAS

31:27.360 --> 31:30.488
IN RARE FORM TONIGHT.
SHE DEFINITELY WAS.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.397
- DO YOU THINK SHE'S JEALOUS
OR SOMETHING?

31:34.440 --> 31:37.648
- SHE'S JEALOUS OF WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW, OF ME.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.500
SHE JUST SEEMS--
- [laughs]

31:39.550 --> 31:42.929
- WHAT?
SHE SEEMED VERY POSSESSIVE.

31:42.970 --> 31:45.063
- WE'RE FRIENDS.
I DON'T KNOW.

31:45.110 --> 31:47.658
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

31:47.690 --> 31:48.418
- REALLY, REALLY?

31:48.450 --> 31:50.486
- YES, DOUBLE REALLY,
I SWEAR.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.726
- DOUBLE REALLY? OKAY.
[laughing]

31:51.770 --> 31:54.352
- EVERYONE REALLY LIKED YOU,
BY THE WAY.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.039
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.629
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

31:59.670 --> 32:03.015
- I'M SAD YOU'RE LEAVING.

32:03.050 --> 32:06.918
- I MISSED YOU, DREW.
- YEAH.

32:08.160 --> 32:14.542
- AND I WAS THINKING
ABOUT IT TONIGHT, JUST...

32:14.580 --> 32:16.400
AND WATCHING YOU
WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS,

32:16.450 --> 32:19.613
AND YOU'RE JUST
SUCH AN AMAZING GUY,

32:19.660 --> 32:24.245
AND I ALWAYS HAVE
SO MUCH FUN WITH YOU.

32:24.280 --> 32:31.072
I FEEL REALLY HORRIBLE ABOUT
THE WAY THINGS ENDED BETWEEN US.

32:32.570 --> 32:34.526
- YEAH, THAT WAS BAD.

32:38.710 --> 32:43.989
YOU KNOW, I--
I GET IT, THOUGH.

32:44.030 --> 32:48.057
I DO.
- I'M REALLY SORRY, DREW.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.989
YOU WERE THERE FOR ME,
AND...

32:51.030 --> 32:54.682
IT'S TAKEN ME A RIDICULOUSLY
LONG TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

32:54.730 --> 33:00.453
BUT I HAVE NOW, AND I WISH
I COULD TAKE IT ALL BACK.

33:00.490 --> 33:07.419
HAVE A DO-OVER, BUT...
I CAN'T, SO...

33:07.460 --> 33:09.143
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

33:09.190 --> 33:15.197
- YEAH. YEAH.
I FORGIVE YOU.

33:15.230 --> 33:18.085

CALL OUT YOUR NAME, LOVE,
DON'T BE SURPRISED

33:42.600 --> 33:46.843
IT'S SO MANY MILES
AND SO LONG SINCE I LEI-T YOU

33:46.880 --> 33:48.256
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
I'LL FIND WHEN

33:48.300 --> 33:51.121
- YOU KNOW,
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DRIVE.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.199
- YEAH. YEAH, MAYBE
YOU COULD JUST CRASH HERE.

33:55.240 --> 33:59.165
- IT'S MANY HUNDRED MILES
AND IT WON'T

33:59.200 --> 34:02.727
BE LONG

34:02.760 --> 34:04.136
- [sighs]

34:06.110 --> 34:08.271
- WHAT THE HELL?

34:08.320 --> 34:09.867
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.140
HE'S DRUNK,
AND HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME,

34:11.180 --> 34:15.731
AND I DID NOT WANT TO TALK
TO HIM IN THAT STATE, YOU KNOW?

34:15.770 --> 34:18.705
I'M SORRY.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.742
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:22.780 --> 34:25.601
- ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ED?

34:28.270 --> 34:29.669
- NO.
- JULIA.

34:29.720 --> 34:32.336

IF THERE IS ANYTHING GOING ON,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL,

34:39.350 --> 34:41.511
YOU HAVE TO--
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.891
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- JOEL,

34:42.940 --> 34:44.271
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.
- I NEED TO KNOW.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.596
I NEED TO KNOW.
JUST--

34:47.630 --> 34:50.497
- THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.394
OKAY?

34:58.750 --> 35:02.504
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:16.390 --> 35:18.381
I'M GONNA FIND A CAB,
OR SOMETHING.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.273
- JOEL, YOU DON'T--

35:33.370 --> 35:36.715
- I DON'T LIKE DANCING SO MUCH,
BUT I LIKE MUSIC.

35:36.750 --> 35:37.671
- I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE A PRETTY GOOD DANCER.

35:37.720 --> 35:38.709
- NO!
- YEAH.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.741

37:58.690 --> 38:03.923
DON'T BE HERE

38:03.970 --> 38:10.967
OH OH OH

38:12.110 --> 38:14.829
OH OH OH

38:14.870 --> 38:15.734
- AHH.

38:40.490 --> 38:41.411
- OH! ARE YOU GONNA GET ME?
- GUYS, GUYS, WAIT.

38:41.450 --> 38:43.133
- HONEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
LOOK OUT, KIDS.

38:43.180 --> 38:45.523
- I'M GONNA FEED YOU.
HOLD ON.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.721
- HI, HANK.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

38:47.770 --> 38:48.623
SORRY I'M BARGING IN HERE.
- I'M WELL, HOW ARE YOU?

38:48.670 --> 38:50.046
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- YOU'RE NOT AT ALL.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.490
- JUST WANTED TO GIVE THAT
BACK TO YOU.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.418
THANK YOU. YEAH.
- OH, YEAH. WOW.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.427
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
LOOKS LIKE YOU--

38:54.470 --> 38:56.665
- YEAH, I DID--I PUT
A FEW EARMARKS ON IT.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.018
I DID SOME NOTES AND, UH--
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:58.050 --> 38:59.460
- MIGHT HAVE GOT SOME FOOD
ON THERE, OR SOMETHING.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.535
I READ IT A LOT.

39:00.570 --> 39:01.741
- WAS IT HELPFUL?
- YEAH.

39:01.780 --> 39:05.090
UH, IT'S--
YOU KNOW, INTERESTING.

39:05.130 --> 39:07.610
- YEAH.
- LEARNED A COUPLE THINGS.

39:07.650 --> 39:09.709
COUPLE THINGS.
HEY, ANOTHER ONE.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.136
- GREAT.
- JEEZ, YOU GUYS.

39:11.170 --> 39:12.512
YOU'RE LIKE RABBITS IN HERE.
- [laughs] NO, IT'S--

39:12.550 --> 39:13.517
- OH, NO. IT'S NOT OURS.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.108
- IT'S OUR NIECE, AIDA.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.654
- UM, IS MAX AROUND?
- YEAH.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.179
- HE'S ACTUALLY UPSTAIRS.

39:19.210 --> 39:21.553
- YEAH, COULD I TALK TO HIM?
I DON'T--YOU KNOW--

39:21.600 --> 39:23.795
IF IT ISN'T WEIRD, I JUST
WANTED TO SEE HOW HE'S DOING.

39:23.840 --> 39:24.761
- NO, I THINK THAT
WOULD BE GOOD.

39:24.810 --> 39:26.186
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

39:26.220 --> 39:27.005
- YEAH, CAN'T GUARANTEE
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

39:27.050 --> 39:28.802
BUT GIVE IT A KNOCK.
- ALL RIGHT.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.637
YEAH, I MEAN,
LET ME SEE WHAT HE SAYS.

39:30.670 --> 39:33.491
THAN KS.
- ALL RIGHT.

39:40.480 --> 39:43.096
- MAD MAX, HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?
WHAT'S UP?

39:45.210 --> 39:47.542
- THIS IS WEIRD.

39:47.590 --> 39:50.753
WHY ARE YOU STANDING
IN MY BEDROOM DOORWAY?

39:50.800 --> 39:53.075
- I WAS JUST HERE.
I WAS VISITING YOUR MOM AND DAD,

39:53.110 --> 39:55.453
AND THEY SAID
YOU WERE UP HERE.

39:55.490 --> 39:59.597
JUST THOUGHT I'D COME UP,
SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.143
CAN I COME IN?

40:01.190 --> 40:05.183
- IF I SAY NO,
WILL YOU GO AWAY?

40:05.230 --> 40:08.870
- NO, PROBABLY NOT.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.844
- COME IN.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.191
- SO THESE LOOK PRETTY COOL.
YOU DID THESE?

40:17.240 --> 40:18.719
YOU MAKE THESE YOURSELF?

40:18.760 --> 40:20.443
- YOU DON'T MAKE PICTURES.
YOU DRAW THEM.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.516
- WELL, THEY'RE COOL.
I USED TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.654
NOT AS GOOD.

40:24.690 --> 40:28.205
HEY, I BROUGHT THE PICTURES
THAT YOU DID.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.104
THEY'RE GOOD,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

40:30.150 --> 40:32.072
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

40:32.110 --> 40:35.637
THIS ONE I LIKE.
I LIKE THE WATER FOUNTAIN.

40:35.670 --> 40:36.944
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT
A NICE LITTLE FLARE THERE.

40:36.980 --> 40:38.709
THIS ONE'S PRETTY COOL.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.492
I THINK IT'S A PIGEON,
OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

40:40.540 --> 40:42.747
- NO, IT'S A DOVE.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.601
- OH, IS IT A DOVE?
- LET ME SEE.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.190
I'M SORRY THAT I YELLED AT YOU

40:52.240 --> 40:55.755
AND THREW THINGS
INSIDE OF YOUR STORE.

40:55.790 --> 40:57.132
I UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

40:57.170 --> 40:59.229
BETWEEN A PROMISE AND A LIE,
AND THAT IT'S NOT NICE

40:59.280 --> 41:02.249
TO ACCUSE SOMEONE OF DISHONESTY
IN A CASUAL MANNER.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.249
I RESPECT YOUR TIME
AND THE WORK THAT YOU DO.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.906
WILL YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY?
- [chuckles]

41:07.940 --> 41:09.999
- MY PARENTS SAID
THAT IF I APOLOGIZE,

41:10.050 --> 41:12.666
WE'LL BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

41:12.710 --> 41:14.917
- YEAH.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.249
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

41:20.580 --> 41:22.150
- DO YOU WANT TO PLAY CHESS?

41:22.200 --> 41:25.886
I'M NOT VERY GOOD,
BUT IF I PLAY MORE, I'LL LEARN.

41:25.930 --> 41:28.922
- YEAH, I'LL PLAY CHESS.
I PLAY A LITTLE CHESS.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.848
- I LIKE TO BE BLACK, BUT
IF YOU HAVE A COLOR PREFERENCE,

41:30.900 --> 41:32.925
I CAN BE FLEXIBLE.
- NO, I'LL BE WHITE.

41:32.970 --> 41:35.063
- GOOD, THAT MAKES THINGS
A LOT EASIER.

41:35.110 --> 41:36.725
- CAN I MOVE THIS OVER?

41:36.770 --> 41:37.862
[groans]
- GO.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.596
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET UPSET
IF I BEAT YOU, RIGHT?

41:40.630 --> 41:42.211
- JUST MOVE YOUR PIECES.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.639
- 'CAUSE I LIKE TO PLAY TO WIN.

41:44.670 --> 41:47.878
[low chatter]

41:47.910 --> 41:54.918
- OH OH OH
