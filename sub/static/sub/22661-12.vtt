WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:03.737
Go, go, go. Oh!
You see that?

00:03.771 --> 00:05.439
We just took the lead!

00:05.473 --> 00:07.441
Hey, Dad, do you think
I could pull off these boots?

00:07.475 --> 00:09.510
Honey, I got 20 bucks
riding on this game.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.546
I-I'll pull your boots
off at halftime, okay?

00:12.580 --> 00:15.483
I don't know about that new
paint color in your bathroom.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.485
I know, Joy;
it's way too yellow.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.753
This morning, I thought
I was peeing on the sun.

00:19.787 --> 00:23.424
It's so bright, I could see it
from my bedroom window.

00:23.457 --> 00:27.695
Yeah, well, that's why
I asked Adam to repaint it.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.497
He turned a shade of red

00:29.530 --> 00:32.133
that I think would actually
look nice in the bathroom.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.834
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.336
Husbands love redoing

00:35.369 --> 00:37.205
what they didn't want to do
in the first place.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.474
Yeah, we disagreed,
but then we sat down,

00:40.508 --> 00:41.775
had a discussion,
and he's repainting.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.244
Ah.
Yeah.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.147
Made him some nachos
to ease the blow.

00:46.180 --> 00:51.085
See, the angry part of his brain
is smaller than the nacho part.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.321
All right, I'll tell you what,
I'll buy you the boots

00:53.354 --> 00:54.855
if you help me repaint
the stupid bathroom--

00:54.888 --> 00:56.424
Ooh, nachos.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.659
Well, you deserve 'em, honey.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.628
And the cheese is
the color of the bathroom,

01:00.661 --> 01:02.396
so you won't forget
to repaint it.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.569
Howdy!

01:08.602 --> 01:10.604
I'm Baggy Britches,
and I have a message.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.605
Are you Kate Burns?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.274
No! No! Say no! Say no!

01:13.307 --> 01:15.709
What is wrong
with your husband?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.811
Don't look at his flower.
That's how they get you.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.581
Adam has a fear of clowns.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.283
It's not a fear, okay?

01:22.316 --> 01:24.685
It's a natural instinct
that's kept me alive thus far.

01:24.718 --> 01:29.257
Then why are you using your
daughter as a human shield?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.491
Because you're
too far away.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.227
Murder her;
I barely know her.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.830
* I've been sent over here
in my baggy pants *

01:36.864 --> 01:38.799
* 'Cause Danny Phillips
wants to ask Kate *

01:38.832 --> 01:40.834
* To the Spring Formal Dance.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.637
Seriously

01:43.671 --> 01:45.539
:
Oh, my God! Mom!

01:45.573 --> 01:47.641
Hey, you want to see some magic?

01:47.675 --> 01:49.410
No, no, no!

01:50.244 --> 01:51.679
Get out! Get out!

01:51.712 --> 01:53.647
Get out, get out, get out!

01:55.383 --> 01:57.218
That was close.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.720
Kate, the Spring Formal.
That's huge!

01:59.753 --> 02:01.189
I know.
I can't believe it.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.456
He's still out there.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.858
Oh, oh! I'm gonna
turn the sprinklers on.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.328
It'll wash off his makeup,
then he'll be powerless.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.531
ANDI:
I couldn't be happier for Kate.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.466
I mean, hardly
any freshman girls

02:12.500 --> 02:14.402
get asked to the
senior dance.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.405
Hold on. The guy
that asked her is a senior?

02:17.438 --> 02:20.541
All right, don't get
all Adam on this.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.343
I'm Adam.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.813
That's the only way I get.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.548
Look, it doesn't mean
they're dating.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.882
It's just one dance.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.285
One dance is enough.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.788
That's where you do all the
laying down things standing up.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.291
Yeah, I know. I remember
from our wedding night.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.826
It was like you had six hands.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.462
Andi, any senior
that asks out a freshman

02:41.495 --> 02:43.431
has something wrong with him.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.200
Okay, he's the kind of guy
who ends up dressed as a clown,

02:46.234 --> 02:48.936
terrorizing honest citizens.

02:48.969 --> 02:52.406
For all we know, that was him.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.909
Boy, you get lost in one
fun house, it ruins your life.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.347
Fun house.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.550
Never has a place been
more incorrectly named.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.486
She is not going to that dance,
and that's the end of it.

03:05.519 --> 03:10.458
Okay, well, let's sit down
and discuss it.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.894
And after, we can have nachos.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.430
No, no, no, no, no.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.932
No. I'm not going
to the chairs with you.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.435
Every time we sit down
and discuss, I lose.

03:21.469 --> 03:25.273
I don't know what you're
talking about, but I'd like to.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.241
Hey, let's have a seat,

03:27.275 --> 03:29.477
talk it out.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.450
Not this time, sunshine.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.286
This time, I'm gonna prep.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.521
I'm going to the blackboard,
drawing some X's and O's,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.456
and getting some plays ready.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.326
Yeah, well, that makes sense.
Yeah.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.561
You want to run
any of these plays by me?

03:47.595 --> 03:51.365
Well, for starters, Katie's--
Oh, you're good.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.034
I'm onto you now, though.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.804
I'm never sitting down
in here again.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.841
*

04:10.518 --> 04:12.320
I just don't think
Katie should date a senior.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.821
But I'm oh for a thousand
with Andi

04:13.854 --> 04:15.623
when we sit down
and have these discussions.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.057
I'm like that team that plays
the Harlem Globetrotters.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.326
I'm trying to make a point,

04:18.359 --> 04:21.995
and she's running circles around
me, bouncing balls off my head.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.632
Our problem is wives have
more stamina than us.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.601
We'd rather lose
than listen.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.970
And even if you win a point,
they keep coming at you,

04:30.003 --> 04:31.839
like waves at the beach.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.941
Blah-blah-blah,
blah-blah-blah.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.411
Mostly my marriage
is fifty-fifty,

04:37.445 --> 04:40.080
but when we have
a difference of opinion, I lose

04:40.113 --> 04:42.416
because I go with my gut
and Andi goes with logic.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.952
She can make a good argument
for any bad idea.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.989
If you really want to win, I
know a trick from the old days.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.992
It's called
silent negotiation.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.661
I've heard of that.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.764
You let her talk first, but
then you don't say a word.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.932
You just stare at her
and wait her out.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.669
She'll start talking in
circles, doubting herself.

05:01.702 --> 05:05.072
Eventually she'll break down
like a Chinese Rolex.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.874
Like the one you gave me
for Christmas?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.676
I went to see what time it was,

05:08.709 --> 05:10.878
and all the numbers
just fell to the bottom.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.781
I told you not to let
the sun hit it!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.783
I don't want Katie
to go to the dance,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.352
but this silent negotiation,
that's never gonna work.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.454
I'm right about this.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.022
My grandfather said "I do,"

05:22.055 --> 05:24.958
then he didn't speak
to his wife again for 40 years.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.627
He got everything he wanted.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.097
Here, I'll do it on Don.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.632
Hey, fellas.
Hey.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.434
Hey, Donny,

05:33.467 --> 05:37.805
I need you to take your mother
to the fabric store tonight.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.374
Sorry, Pop,
but we've been over this.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.377
It's not my responsibility
to run Mom around town.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.818
I'm her son, not her husband.
I have my own life.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.792
Come on, Pop, the fabric store?

06:01.562 --> 06:04.898
Although, Mom is getting older.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.101
Fine, I'll pick her up at 7:00.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.471
And that's how
you do that.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.105
Wow, look at him.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.576
He's still trying
to figure out what happened,

06:15.609 --> 06:19.012
like a bird
that flew into a window.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.415
Hello, darling.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.751
I'm ready to

06:23.784 --> 06:27.087
sit down and discuss
this whole...

06:28.689 --> 06:30.123
...Katie situation.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.760
Okay. I was born to discuss.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.665
You should know, I don't
have any nacho stuff.

06:37.698 --> 06:41.068
I'll take my chances.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.903
Ladies first.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.673
Okay, here's how I see it.
Okay, Kate is very mature.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.174
I mean, you've said
that yourself,

06:47.207 --> 06:51.078
so you're kind of arguing
against yourself here.

06:53.213 --> 06:58.118
And... and the school
has chaperones

06:58.151 --> 07:00.821
watching the entire time,

07:00.854 --> 07:03.090
thus removing
any potential for danger.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.459
Boom. Game, set, match.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.695
Hit the showers, kid! Ha!

07:11.031 --> 07:14.234
It's a school sanctioned event,
Adam.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.704
I mean, nothing will go wrong.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.139
She's gonna be surrounded
by adults all night.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.979
Except in the car.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.817
Which is where boys get handsy.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.154
And she's gonna be hanging out
with Danny's friends.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.824
And older kids
sneak alcohol into dances.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.493
You know what? You're right.
She shouldn't go to this thing.

07:39.527 --> 07:43.063
It's a bad idea.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.699
So we've reached an agreement?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.170
I guess so, yeah.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.914
Well, thanks for hearing me out.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.625
I've heard stories of
women losing arguments

08:11.659 --> 08:13.226
to their husbands;
I just never thought

08:13.260 --> 08:15.629
it'd happen to
someone I knew.

08:15.663 --> 08:18.265
What did he say
that was so convincing?

08:18.298 --> 08:21.535
Well,  he made
a lot of good points.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.738
He said...

08:24.772 --> 08:26.574
No, no, I said that.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.676
But he did say that...

08:28.709 --> 08:31.645
No, I said that, too.

08:31.679 --> 08:36.083
Wait, come to think of it,
he didn't say anything.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.786
Oh. He played the quiet game.

08:38.819 --> 08:39.853
What?

08:39.887 --> 08:40.921
It's a trick.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.089
That's how I got engaged.

08:42.122 --> 08:45.158
Rudy just wanted to shack up,
so I kept my mouth shut

08:45.192 --> 08:48.862
until he came back with a ring,
and then a better ring.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.664
So Adam played dirty.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.332
I knew I wasn't wrong.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.301
Kate should go to the dance.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.303
First of all,
you're never wrong.

08:56.336 --> 08:59.172
And even if you're wrong, you're
still more right than him.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.942
Yeah, well,
I can play dirty, too.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.011
Oh-ho-ho, just you watch.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.013
How do I play dirty?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.248
Well, he wanted to make
this decision, right?

09:08.281 --> 09:11.318
I say pile it on,
make him pick everything.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.120
Like the new color
for the bathroom.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.121
Oh, I can't let him do that.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.356
He'll just paint
a Van Halen logo on the wall.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.126
It won't even get that far.
Men hate these decisions.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.629
What color, how many,
thread count.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.096
Thread count.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.332
He doesn't even know
what that is.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.967
It'll drive him so crazy,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.970
he'll eventually fold
on everything, including Kate.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.806
And victory will be mine.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.709
I mean, you know, we'll be doing
the right thing for Kate,

09:35.743 --> 09:37.745
and that's what's important.

09:39.847 --> 09:43.383
It was beautiful, Don.
I said nothing and she caved.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.385
I wish I was
wearing a body cam,

09:45.418 --> 09:48.221
'cause that's a movie I would
watch every year on my birthday.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.824
We should celebrate this win

09:50.858 --> 09:52.292
by going fishing this weekend.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.994
Ah, not so fast.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.630
That silent negotiation,
that's bad voodoo.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.000
I spent hours with Mom
at that fabric store.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.069
Do you know how many kinds
of corduroy there are?

10:02.102 --> 10:05.839
There's wide wale, pinwale,
pincord, needlecord.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.675
I'm never gonna
be the same.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.911
Oh, here comes Katie.
Hey, Katie.

10:10.944 --> 10:15.148
Oh! So, the man who won't let me
go to the dance says hey.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.685
Hi, Uncle Don, and nobody else.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.419
Hi, Katie.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.022
I like your
needlecord pants.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.958
Thanks, Uncle Don,
and nobody else.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.196
You see how mad she is?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.398
That's how you know I won.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.300
Oh, it's not over yet.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.102
When you mess with
Mother Nature,

10:35.135 --> 10:37.037
there's always
unintended consequences.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.708
This is Jurassic Park stuff
you're screwing around with.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.143
You just don't
understand winning.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.179
It's so unfamiliar,
it scares you.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.048
Hey, babe. Listen, uh,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.450
Don and I were thinking about
going fishing this weekend.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.953
Actually, I was hoping that
you'd go to the paint store

10:52.986 --> 10:54.421
and choose a new color
for the bathroom.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.990
What

10:57.024 --> 11:00.027
Well, you know,
you were so right about Kate,

11:00.060 --> 11:03.230
I realized you should be making
more decisions around here.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.199
No, I shouldn't. What?

11:06.233 --> 11:09.870
T. rex is out
of the pen.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.205
Also, um, look through
these brochures

11:12.239 --> 11:14.441
and choose a summer camp
for the kids.

11:14.474 --> 11:18.478
But I was gonna watch TV.
This stuff is your thing.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.082
Well, now I'm gonna watch TV.
It's my new thing.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.418
Oh, I almost forgot.

11:25.452 --> 11:29.189
Um, can you pick us out
a new bed skirt? Great, thanks.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.294
A bed skirt?

11:34.327 --> 11:37.430
What the hell is a bed skirt?

11:37.464 --> 11:40.700
I think we know who wears
the bed skirt in this family.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.177
Look at all this.
I got to choose paint colors,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.445
summer camps,
some made up thing

11:52.479 --> 11:54.281
called a bed skirt.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.183
What the hell happened?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.284
You messed with nature.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.787
Now you got dinosaurs
running all over the island.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.956
Yeah, I screwed up the whole
balance of our marriage.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.259
Before this, she made
a billion decisions without me.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.428
And I was happy because
I didn't have to chime in,

12:08.461 --> 12:11.131
and she was happy because
she got to decide stuff

12:11.164 --> 12:12.866
without some chump chiming in.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.135
Amen, brother.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.504
I haven't chimed in since 1989.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.273
I bought parachute pants.
Learned my lesson.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.476
Yeah, like I get up
early on Saturdays

12:23.510 --> 12:25.879
to close the drapes
so we can sleep in.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.181
But the drapes are there
because she picked them.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.517
She never asked my opinion,
because I don't have one.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.885
In fact,

12:31.919 --> 12:34.187
gun to my head,
what color are the drapes?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.889
No idea.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.525
But now your opinion's
being respected.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.360
Yeah, and I don't like it.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.363
And all because
I won one discussion.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.799
So, then maybe you need
to have another discussion

12:45.833 --> 12:47.534
and lose that one.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.303
That'll put you back
on the bottom, where you belong.

12:50.337 --> 12:54.174
Ooh, that's not a bad idea.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.543
Yeah. Hey, you want me
to lose a fight?

12:56.576 --> 12:59.246
I'll lose a fight.
This guy's going down.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.414
Now you sound like
a real husband.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.818
I don't think
this is working.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.386
I mean, Adam hasn't
run back in here

13:06.419 --> 13:08.488
telling me that Kate
should go to the dance.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.523
You promised me
total domination.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.560
Just make sure you lose
the next discussion with Adam,

13:13.593 --> 13:16.563
whatever it is, so you can keep
loading him up with decisions.

13:16.596 --> 13:20.400
Okay, but if I end up with
a Van Halen logo on my wall,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.335
you're painting over it.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.838
Okay, Joy just left.
It's time.

13:24.872 --> 13:26.573
Okay, champ, you ready
to lose this thing?

13:26.606 --> 13:28.909
Oh, yeah. I have got
a truly terrible argument.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.178
There's no way I can win.
Ah, that's the spirit.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.013
Now get in there and take
a dive, make us all proud.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.082
Okay.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.283
Hey.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.485
Listen, I have something
I'd like to discuss.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.854
Ooh, great.
I'd love to discuss something.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.523
Okay, well, uh, I was thinking
about the kids' summer camp.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.859
Whatever you're thinking
is right, I'm sure.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.861
No, no, hold on.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.498
I was thinking they
shouldn't go to camp at all.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.466
What?

13:53.500 --> 13:57.504
Yeah. I mean, is it really a
good idea for kids to have fun?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.506
Huh?

13:59.539 --> 14:03.110
It'll just make being an
adult that much sadder

14:03.143 --> 14:07.280
when they think back at all
the fun they used to have.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.351
That is quite a theory.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.286
Well, that's what happens
when I make decisions.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.523
Plus, what are we gonna do for
two weeks with no kids, huh?

14:16.556 --> 14:19.893
Take our own vacation?
That's stupid.

14:19.927 --> 14:23.196
That is stupid.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.065
You're right again.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.300
You always make
such good decisions.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.336
No, I don't.
Great job.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.540
Speaking of which,
Kate needs new bras.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.243
Who needs new what, now

14:36.276 --> 14:38.478
Just get on the Internet
and see what you can find.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.615
Teen girl bras?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.518
I don't want to Google that.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.422
We just grounded Teddy
for Googling that!

14:51.524 --> 14:54.161
I never should've used
that stupid silent negotiation.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.562
What were you thinking?

14:55.595 --> 14:58.331
You told me to do it.

14:58.365 --> 15:02.135
I told you what it was;
I didn't tell you to do it.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.671
So, Andi was fine with the
kids staying home all summer?

15:04.704 --> 15:05.973
Yeah.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.640
She said I made
some good points.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.442
And I'll tell you
something, I did not.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.212
She's up to something.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.215
I bet she knows
you used a trick.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.683
Maybe the reason
nobody does it anymore

15:16.716 --> 15:18.685
is because all the wives
figured it out.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.221
That's right.
This is why we stopped doing it.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.256
It unravels marriages.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.726
What?

15:26.759 --> 15:29.396
They evolved,
but we didn't.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.198
Just like Jurassic Park.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.666
Oh, will you, will
you stop with that?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.435
See a different movie.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.970
Why? It explains
everything.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.749
You don't want me
buying Katie's bras.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.418
You're playing dirty.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.186
You played dirty first.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.721
No!

15:54.754 --> 15:56.756
Yeah, you got me.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.259
But, look, I'm already
being punished.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.628
I just want things
to go back to normal.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.631
You pick stuff, I watch TV.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.000
I agree, that's how we work.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.273
How do we do that?

16:13.306 --> 16:17.144
I guess we have to go back
to the beginning.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.312
Back to where it all started.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.548
Behind the Dumpster at Chili's?

16:23.783 --> 16:27.387
No! We're never
going back that far.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.223
No, I'm talking about
Kate and the dance.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.760
So, sit down
and we can discuss it.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.600
I still can't believe you guys
are letting me go to the dance.

16:40.633 --> 16:41.801
Thank you so much.

16:41.834 --> 16:46.406
Ah, we went to the chairs, and
the Globetrotters won again.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.075
Oh, I forgot my phone.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.678
I am back, baby.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.747
And now we have a pink bathroom
in our house, that I love.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.516
Oh, technically it's mauve.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.319
I am thrilled to
say I do not care.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.057
That must be Kate's date.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.693
I don't know why,
but I'm feeling nachos.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.164
Hey. What's up?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.632
You're a giant.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.668
Dad, your
friend's here.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.671
Is Kate ready?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.573
Uh, Adam?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.242
Yeah. Uh, hey, big guy.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.778
Katie will be out in a minute.
Yeah, okay.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.480
We can't let our daughter
go out alone

17:27.514 --> 17:29.316
with that-that lumberjack
in a tux.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.518
I mean, did you see him?
He filled up the whole doorway!

17:31.551 --> 17:32.719
All right, all right.
Don't panic, don't panic.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.355
Oh, okay.
I'll go with them.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.790
Yeah. Although,
he looked pretty strong.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.528
I wish I still had
that bear spray.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.196
Katie, your date's here!

17:43.230 --> 17:44.797
You'll go
Yeah, sure. Absolutely, yeah.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.166
Apparently,
they don't have a problem

17:46.199 --> 17:47.834
with grown men
going to their dances.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.369
You're the best.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.505
Maybe later we can
swing by Chili's.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.709
Uh, okay.
Uh, come on, we're going!

17:56.743 --> 17:58.745
Wait, you're going, too?

17:58.778 --> 18:02.715
Damn right I am.
I call shotgun.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.684
Chili's. You're so naughty.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.793
Hey. How'd it go?

18:13.826 --> 18:15.195
I had a blast.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.464
I thought Danny and I
kind of had a spark.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.867
Yeah, you two were so cute
in the photo booth together.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.806
Ah. You'll thank
me someday.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.143
No, she won't.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.279
You didn't embarrass her
too bad, did you?

18:32.312 --> 18:33.780
Embarrass her?

18:33.813 --> 18:35.815
I won the dance contest.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.834
Oh! Oh!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.338
Now we're even.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.176
Very funny.
See you at prom!
