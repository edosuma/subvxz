03:22.292 --> 03:26.581
<i>Dear God, watch over me
as I embark on this next posting.</i>

03:28.083 --> 03:30.495
<i>Think I'll have to get up
at about six tomorrow.</i>

03:37.292 --> 03:38.998
<i>The pain in my stomach persists</i>

03:39.125 --> 03:42.447
<i>and is now further hampered
by menstruation.</i>

03:42.583 --> 03:45.950
<i>I have taken two ibuprofen
and milk of magnesia.</i>

03:51.333 --> 03:52.413
<i>Forgive me my impatience</i>

03:52.542 --> 03:55.158
<i>but I hope you will reveal
your plan for me soon.</i>

03:56.125 --> 03:58.226
<i>I cant shake the feeling
that you must have saved me</i>

03:58.250 --> 04:00.081
<i>for something greater than this.</i>

04:02.708 --> 04:05.074
<i>Not that Im complaining or anything.</i>

04:05.208 --> 04:06.323
<i>Amen.</i>

04:52.458 --> 04:54.540
- Hi. Are you Maud?
- Yes. Hi.

04:54.667 --> 04:58.489
So, I left some notes out
on the kitchen table with all her bits.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.115
She has a mate
coming over tomorrow.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.081
Try and keep her off the sauce.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.620
Doctors just started her
on a new course of B12 shots

05:04.750 --> 05:08.163
so shes having one of those
every evening before dinner.

05:08.292 --> 05:11.705
Your bedrooms upstairs on the left.
Her majestys in there, having a nap.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.706
How is she?

05:14.917 --> 05:17.454
Bit of a cunt. Have fun.

06:10.792 --> 06:11.872
Amanda Kohl.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.744
49 years old.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.581
Can you feel that?

06:16.708 --> 06:19.165
Stage four lymphoma
of the spinal cord.

06:19.292 --> 06:20.292
Yep.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.123
Yep, yep.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.866
I daresay you'll be seeing
this one soon.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.365
- Feel that?
- Uh-huh.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.365
- We done?
- Mm-hm.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.453
What time would you like dinner?

06:34.583 --> 06:35.698
Eight o'clock.

06:38.042 --> 06:40.829
Theres a shopping list
on the hall table.

06:43.792 --> 06:44.792
I got it.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.869
I looked her up before I came here.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.197
Dancer, choreographer,
minor celebrity.

07:13.292 --> 07:15.533
As you know,
I have little time for creative types

07:15.667 --> 07:17.874
as they tend to be rather self-involved.

07:28.625 --> 07:30.081
What are you cooking up in there?

07:30.208 --> 07:32.290
Spaghetti bolognese and garlic bread.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.455
Splendid.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.991
Are you just careless

07:41.125 --> 07:44.993
As you seem to be

07:45.125 --> 07:50.245
or do you just care less for me?

07:54.167 --> 07:56.704
- Is that temperature all right?
- Mm, its fine.

08:40.625 --> 08:41.865
Hello.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.707
- Whos your Saint?
- Mary Magdalene.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.829
I didnt know
they made necklaces of her.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.243
I ordered it online.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.703
You're prettier than the last one.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.331
Hey.

10:23.917 --> 10:24.997
What do you think?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.206
It"s good.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.407
- You must be Mary.
- No, Maud.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.285
Hope were not turfing you out.

10:43.417 --> 10:46.329
- No, no. Im going to meet a friend.
- Good, good.

10:46.458 --> 10:47.538
Cheerio, then.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.582
I should have told her
I'd be happy just to stay in my room.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.365
She must be embarrassed.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.351
- Can you spare some change, please?
- Sorry, mate, I aint got nothing.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.581
Fuck off, then.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.036
Excuse me, miss.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.527
Can you spare some change, please?

11:22.500 --> 11:23.660
Thank you, love.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.783
Bit, er... bit nippy out, innit?

11:25.917 --> 11:27.999
May god bless you
and never waste your pain.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.910
- What?
- Nothing.

11:31.542 --> 11:33.533
God bless you too, sweetheart.

11:40.292 --> 11:42.999
Why would someone like her
end up in a town like this?

11:46.583 --> 11:49.575
This dump can't appeal to her
any more than it does to me.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
Hello?

12:02.583 --> 12:04.369
What's happened?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.580
Come back to London.

12:05.708 --> 12:08.308
You cant just lock yourself up here.
You should be around people.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.117
Why the fuck do you care
so much all of a sudden?

12:11.250 --> 12:13.866
Dont be petulant. You're getting
dangerously Norma Desmond.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.911
Oh, fuck you!

12:16.042 --> 12:17.703
You stupid cow.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.998
- Hello.
- Hello!

12:25.417 --> 12:27.282
Sorry to call you back early.

12:27.417 --> 12:30.284
Silly old thing used
to knock it back no problem.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.907
Even I could'nt keep up with her.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.578
Things are different now.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.164
Yes.

12:35.292 --> 12:36.327
Yes, of course.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.536
Do you, um...
Need me to do anything?

12:40.667 --> 12:41.907
No.

12:42.042 --> 12:45.455
- She'll be all right?
- Oh, dont be an idiot, Richard.

12:46.167 --> 12:48.579
Yes, well...
Take care of yourself, darling.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.789
Pompous arsehole.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.114
You should've seen him way back.
He was constantly trying to fuck me.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.706
He has plugs now. Did you see?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.498
- No.
- No.

13:15.625 --> 13:16.625
Well...

13:16.750 --> 13:18.832
No one sees
what they dont want to.

13:48.958 --> 13:49.958
Stay with me.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.664
I dont want to be alone.

14:10.292 --> 14:12.328
How long have you been doing this?

14:12.458 --> 14:13.789
Just over a year.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.581
What were you doing before?

14:17.708 --> 14:20.040
I worked at St Afras hospital.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.452
Horrible place.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.161
Have you seen a lot of death?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.125
Yes.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.036
What made you leave?

14:38.042 --> 14:40.454
I dont know,
I just needed a change.

14:42.458 --> 14:43.458
I dunno.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.661
I think I was spread too thin.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.536
And it's what god wanted.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.749
When he came, everything changed.

14:58.292 --> 15:00.499
So this is a recent conversion?

15:04.792 --> 15:07.329
When you pray,
do you get a response?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.081
Sometimes he talks.

15:15.833 --> 15:16.948
You hear his voice?

15:19.917 --> 15:21.657
Most of the time it...

15:21.792 --> 15:24.989
It's just like he's physically...

15:25.875 --> 15:28.491
In me or around me.

15:30.042 --> 15:31.248
It's how he guides me.

15:32.792 --> 15:35.704
Like, when he's pleased,
it's like a...

15:35.833 --> 15:37.619
A shiver or...

15:37.750 --> 15:40.412
Sometimes its like a pulsing.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.285
And it's all...

15:44.125 --> 15:45.956
Warm and good.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.740
And he's just there.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.532
Nothing feels real anymore.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.207
Ever since I moved back here,

16:09.333 --> 16:11.790
I keep thinking
about that last moment

16:12.583 --> 16:13.789
and wondering...

16:15.417 --> 16:17.078
What it will be like.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.039
What will I be looking at?

16:21.625 --> 16:23.661
Will there be anyone else there?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.160
And then what?

16:32.667 --> 16:33.702
Nothing?

16:36.708 --> 16:38.073
Tell me I'm wrong.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.115
There is more.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.289
And not just afterwards.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.948
He's everywhere.

16:53.042 --> 16:54.373
He sees you.

16:55.917 --> 16:57.532
He won't let you fall.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.243
My little saviour.

19:12.083 --> 19:15.371
Father, thank you.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.492
And bring your hand to join...

19:20.542 --> 19:22.123
Your right hand.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.912
And then draw a semi-circle
above your head.

19:26.125 --> 19:29.788
<i>Now, don't get me wrong,
palliative care is noble work.</i>

19:31.375 --> 19:34.412
<i>But I always knew you had
something more planned for me.</i>

19:38.958 --> 19:42.780
<i>It takes nothing special to mop up
after the decrepit and the dying.</i>

19:44.917 --> 19:46.248
<i>But to save a soul,</i>

19:47.458 --> 19:49.039
<i>thats quite something.</i>

19:55.875 --> 19:57.911
<i>Your presence graces the air</i>

19:58.875 --> 20:01.617
<i>and I feel fuller of your love
than ever before.</i>

20:04.125 --> 20:05.581
<i>More than enough to share.</i>

20:42.708 --> 20:43.993
I can see you.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.868
Yes?

20:52.833 --> 20:54.789
- Cynthia left?
- Yes, Im Maud.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.117
- Carol.
- It's too late to be visiting now.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.956
- It...
- She's expecting me.

21:04.292 --> 21:05.292
She's sleeping.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.994
Maud?

22:23.125 --> 22:24.535
Come and join me.

22:26.833 --> 22:28.619
<i>He ended his life last month</i>

22:28.750 --> 22:30.991
<i>at a legalised euthanasia clinic
in Switzerland.</i>

22:31.875 --> 22:34.947
<i>John said it was his final wish
to have a peaceful, pain-free death</i>

22:35.083 --> 22:37.950
<i>with his family by his side.</i>

22:38.083 --> 22:39.323
<i>Thanks, Julia.</i>

22:39.458 --> 22:44.248
<i>Before he passed, John wrote
an open letter to MP's here in England.</i>

22:44.375 --> 22:46.991
<i>He wanted everybody to know...</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:59.665
Dear god, here is Amanda.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.911
Well, you know that.

23:02.042 --> 23:04.078
Thank you
for bringing us together, lord.

23:05.375 --> 23:07.957
And thank you for this meal
which we gratefully receive.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.164
Bless Amanda's body

23:15.292 --> 23:16.998
which is hurting now

23:17.125 --> 23:20.242
but has done
so many wonderful things.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.990
And bless her mind,

23:22.125 --> 23:24.366
which is shrouded in darkness,

23:25.625 --> 23:28.082
and reach out to her
like you did to me.

23:29.917 --> 23:31.202
Amen.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.539
He's here?

23:52.083 --> 23:53.869
I feel it too.

24:51.333 --> 24:53.449
You look beautiful.

24:53.583 --> 24:56.165
- No!
- Yes.

24:59.875 --> 25:05.541
Now, don't you cry...

26:06.375 --> 26:07.455
Hey.

26:09.042 --> 26:10.953
No, I can't tonight.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.539
You know where I am.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.157
She's all right.

26:14.292 --> 26:15.407
Bit weird but...

26:15.542 --> 26:17.453
Shh. I gotta go.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.618
Yeah, ok. Bye, bye.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.032
Maud, your face.

26:37.042 --> 26:39.124
Oh, shit.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.770
Fuck, it's all over her dressing gown.

26:40.833 --> 26:41.913
Shit.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.286
Maud, I can do it.

26:46.083 --> 26:49.575
- Don't let her drink too much.
- Dont' worry, it's mostly for me.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.116
Honey, come back to me.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.328
<i>Religious themes would play
a prominent role</i>

27:02.458 --> 27:04.824
<i>throughout Blakes career,</i>

27:04.958 --> 27:07.870
<i>namely a rejection
of organised religion,</i>

27:10.208 --> 27:14.872
<i>which he claimed was an ugly distortion
of a true spiritual life.</i>

28:35.250 --> 28:36.250
Bye.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.452
Carol?

28:39.583 --> 28:40.583
Hey.

28:43.667 --> 28:44.873
I need to talk to you.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.292
Yeah?

28:51.333 --> 28:54.951
- Whats up?
- I want you to stop seeing Amanda.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.786
Just leave her alone.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.579
- Did she tell you to come after me?
- No, I'm telling you.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.244
It's an important time for her.

29:02.375 --> 29:05.993
She's got big things to deal with
and she needs to be focused.

29:06.958 --> 29:10.121
And I just dont think
you can fit into that anymore.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.115
I dont know
what you're talking about, but...

29:12.250 --> 29:14.531
I'm sure your patients sex life
is none of your business.

29:14.625 --> 29:16.081
I know she's giving you money.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.036
Again, none of your fucking business.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.697
Look, I'm trying to be respectful.

29:22.833 --> 29:24.949
I didn't swear at you or anything.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.198
I just...

29:27.208 --> 29:29.824
- I just don't think its a good idea.
- Please. Respectful?

29:30.375 --> 29:31.990
You just don't like
that she fucks women.

29:32.125 --> 29:34.081
You could have
an eight-inch cock for all I care.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.745
I'd still be telling you this
after the way you looked at her.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.207
- Whoa. What?
- What was that, by the way?

29:40.167 --> 29:42.954
Do you think your'e too good for her?
Do you think this is a joke?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.074
- Of course not.
- Amanda is dying.

29:45.833 --> 29:48.620
I have a responsibility
to look after her.

29:49.625 --> 29:51.957
This is life and death.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.665
It's spiritual, on another level.

29:55.583 --> 29:58.450
No hard feelings.
I'm sure you're great in bed.

29:58.583 --> 30:00.543
But you're just a waste of her time
at the moment.

30:01.417 --> 30:03.578
Can you hear yourself?

30:03.708 --> 30:05.448
Maud, you're her nurse.

30:05.583 --> 30:08.450
She does'nt want you to see it
but she is vulnerable right now.

30:09.333 --> 30:12.325
And it is not right
that she spends her last days

30:12.458 --> 30:16.030
getting worked up about a silly girl
who does'nt care about her.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.032
- I care about her.
- Not enough.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.491
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

30:22.625 --> 30:23.660
Oh.

30:26.208 --> 30:27.789
Ok, so you'll do it?

30:28.750 --> 30:30.240
Anything you say, Maud.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.248
Don't tell her I told you, though.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.286
Just, you know, make something up.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.615
Don't hurt her feelings.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.123
Ok.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.539
Think it went well.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.495
A whole day
and her phone has been silent.

31:04.208 --> 31:06.244
It must be a relief to her too.

31:09.125 --> 31:11.286
She radiates peace,

31:11.417 --> 31:14.830
and I am reminded of myself
in the first flushes of your love.

31:19.167 --> 31:21.032
We dont need anyone else.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.032
Katie?

31:42.750 --> 31:43.956
Katie!

31:44.833 --> 31:47.700
Katie, hey!
I thought that was you.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.032
How's it going? It's been ages.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.077
Yeah, good.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.411
How are you, Joy?

31:56.542 --> 31:59.454
Yeah, not bad, not bad.
You know, knackered.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.198
Got patients sleeping in corridors.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.745
Surgeries all double-booked.
It's a total madhouse.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.707
So, how's it going?
Are you taking care of yourself?

32:09.833 --> 32:10.833
Yeah.

32:10.958 --> 32:12.744
We all thought you must've left town.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.456
No one sees you
out and about anymore.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.624
- I've been around.
- Oh, yeah?

32:17.750 --> 32:20.162
- What are you up to?
- I'm a private carer.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.956
You're still nursing?

32:23.083 --> 32:24.619
- What?
- Nothing.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.081
Just surprised. I mean...

32:27.125 --> 32:29.616
- Where are you doing it? Who with?
- A private agency.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.581
- And they know what happened?
- Yes.

32:34.417 --> 32:36.499
Well, I've got to go.
It was nice to see you, Joy.

32:38.958 --> 32:39.993
Katie.

32:49.042 --> 32:50.782
Take my number, yeah?

32:50.917 --> 32:51.952
What?

32:52.625 --> 32:56.038
If you ever want to talk
or get a drink or... anything.

33:14.375 --> 33:15.660
That one there.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.036
Yes, and then that one.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.240
Uh, you cant do that.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.375
What?

33:33.958 --> 33:37.155
You... you slipped those cards in.

33:37.833 --> 33:38.833
Did I?

33:42.833 --> 33:44.198
Its no fun if you cheat.

33:44.333 --> 33:47.075
Which one was it? Hm, that one.

33:49.833 --> 33:51.619
Can you give me a moment?

33:51.750 --> 33:53.786
- Uh, yes.
- And take that away.

33:56.375 --> 33:58.991
- Ooh, can I have a cup of tea?
- Of course.

34:01.750 --> 34:02.990
Hello.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.203
I didn't expect to hear from you.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.034
What do you mean?

34:20.542 --> 34:21.542
Why?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.956
There you go.

34:43.917 --> 34:47.080
You know, I've been thinking,
it might be nice to go out sometime,

34:47.208 --> 34:48.822
to the theatre or something.

34:49.417 --> 34:53.239
I would have no clue what to see
but I'm sure you can suggest something.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.245
- And maybe after I leave...
- I want to go to bed.

35:00.208 --> 35:01.573
It's five oclock.

35:02.042 --> 35:04.033
I will go to bed
when I damn well like.

35:06.042 --> 35:07.452
Yes, of course.

35:08.625 --> 35:10.115
Now is not the time.

36:39.042 --> 36:40.373
I need you to go into town.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.500
Yeah?

36:41.625 --> 36:44.241
To pick up some things for tonight.
I'll make a list.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.323
Ok, no problem.

37:28.958 --> 37:31.916
Oh, yes!

37:52.083 --> 37:54.324
- Is it ready?
- I'm just lighting the candles.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.240
Plates.

38:09.958 --> 38:11.164
Get the lights.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.998
- Lights.
- Make a wish.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.366
So, Carol,
how did you and Mandy meet?

39:03.500 --> 39:04.831
We met online.

39:04.958 --> 39:06.573
Ah, so now you have
a ménage a trois.

39:06.708 --> 39:09.120
Hardly. Maud does'nt like Carol.

39:10.042 --> 39:14.240
It's funny, I can't figure out
if she's a bigot or if she's just jealous.

39:14.375 --> 39:18.448
She went sneaking behind my back
to try to scare Carol away.

39:20.250 --> 39:24.118
To save my soul,
if I understand correctly.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.160
Excuse me.

39:28.292 --> 39:31.034
Dont run away.
I'm talking to you.

39:31.167 --> 39:34.079
Maud is my saviour, you see.

39:34.958 --> 39:38.871
She's been looking out for me
in more ways than one, but...

39:39.000 --> 39:41.036
You got a little carried away,
didn't you?

39:43.625 --> 39:44.785
So, what is it?

39:47.458 --> 39:48.618
Am I indecent?

39:49.333 --> 39:50.869
No, youre lost.

39:52.833 --> 39:55.199
Richard, want to show us
some moves?

40:31.250 --> 40:33.206
Theres my little Saint.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.999
Oh, no, no.
Sweetheart, no, no, no.

40:38.125 --> 40:41.367
You know you shouldn't take
anything I say seriously.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.206
I just wanna see you loosen up.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.369
You are a beautiful young woman,

40:45.500 --> 40:48.207
and you should have some fun
while you still can.

40:49.792 --> 40:52.374
I've got more important things
on my mind.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.990
Oh, yes, of course.

40:54.125 --> 40:57.822
How could mere human frivolity
possibly compete

40:57.958 --> 41:00.324
with the heavenly fathers
warm heart pulsing...

41:02.375 --> 41:03.865
Lets go. Lets go.

41:20.542 --> 41:22.248
Maybe if you just let me talk to her.

41:22.375 --> 41:24.081
No, absolutely not.

41:24.208 --> 41:26.540
You should be thankful
she isn't pressing charges.

41:32.875 --> 41:33.990
Is everything all right?

41:38.750 --> 41:39.785
I'm fine.

42:56.792 --> 42:58.703
God,

42:58.833 --> 43:00.949
all I feel of you now is this pain.

43:02.083 --> 43:03.744
A gnawing burning.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.947
Maybe it's ulcers or cancer

43:09.083 --> 43:10.744
or appendicitis.

43:11.667 --> 43:13.227
If you're trying
to teach me something,

43:14.458 --> 43:15.948
 can't see what it is.

43:37.542 --> 43:40.204
Quite frankly
it all just seems such a waste.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.582
I was ready and open and alive

43:45.708 --> 43:47.824
and this is my reward:

43:47.958 --> 43:49.118
Unemployable,

43:50.458 --> 43:51.573
unoccupied.

43:57.375 --> 43:59.457
Perhaps you were'nt as wise
as I thought.

44:01.292 --> 44:03.408
Perhaps I was'nt paying
enough attention.

44:15.417 --> 44:18.659
I can't help but feel
an act of spite has occurred.

44:28.375 --> 44:31.162
If this is how you treat
your most loyal subjects

44:33.125 --> 44:35.787
l shudder to think
what awaits those who shun you.

46:18.250 --> 46:19.285
Yes, that's it.

46:19.417 --> 46:20.497
Yeah, yeah.

46:21.458 --> 46:23.164
Oh, yes. On!

46:25.917 --> 46:27.282
- Not yet.
- Oh!

46:27.417 --> 46:28.702
Oh, god!

46:28.833 --> 46:30.448
Oh, sorry. Oh.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.580
See you later.

47:43.292 --> 47:45.248
Hey, Joy, its Katie.

47:47.125 --> 47:51.789
Hey. Yeah, I was just wondering
if you wanna go for that drink,

47:51.917 --> 47:55.614
you know, have that chat
and just hang out,

47:55.750 --> 47:57.615
like you said, to chat.

47:59.667 --> 48:01.032
Cool. Great.

48:01.167 --> 48:02.452
That's great.

48:05.375 --> 48:08.742
I did think it was kind of weird
when I saw you and you suggested it,

48:08.875 --> 48:11.708
just because you never seemed
to like me that much.

48:13.583 --> 48:14.583
No...

48:14.708 --> 48:18.200
No, no, no, no.
I didnt... I didn't mean...

48:18.333 --> 48:19.493
Don't be like that.

48:21.167 --> 48:24.614
Well, Im just at the star
at the moment with some friends,

48:24.750 --> 48:27.742
but I think they're heading off soon
but I'm gonna hang around a bit.

48:27.875 --> 48:29.536
Oh, sorry.

48:30.792 --> 48:31.872
Yeah, of course.

48:33.458 --> 48:36.120
In that case, my apologies.

48:36.250 --> 48:38.912
I'm being stupid so, uh, bye.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.365
Oh, careful.

49:23.458 --> 49:24.868
You owe me a drink.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.081
Is everything ok?

49:58.042 --> 49:59.657
Shh, shh, shh.

50:01.375 --> 50:03.161
Shh, it's ok. It's ok.

50:05.250 --> 50:06.250
Shh.

50:08.292 --> 50:09.292
Come on.

50:10.458 --> 50:11.994
- Easy.
- No.

50:12.125 --> 50:13.240
Easy!

50:44.708 --> 50:45.914
I remember you, you know.

50:48.125 --> 50:50.081
You used to be out all the time.

50:50.958 --> 50:52.073
While back.

50:53.375 --> 50:54.581
I think...

50:55.958 --> 50:57.789
You and my mate Tommy had it off.

50:59.750 --> 51:02.366
Ah, I remember you.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.991
A lovely, lovely little nursey, hey?

52:04.417 --> 52:05.873
I did everything.

52:07.750 --> 52:09.786
Everything. I changed, did'nt 1?

52:12.333 --> 52:14.119
I thought I did
what you told me to do.

52:14.250 --> 52:15.250
Didn't I?

52:17.375 --> 52:18.660
Please.

52:18.792 --> 52:20.783
Please don't let me fall again.

52:22.292 --> 52:23.498
I'm begging you.

52:24.958 --> 52:26.164
I'll do anything.

52:28.250 --> 52:30.366
Please guide me.

54:32.042 --> 54:34.784
<i>Revelation, and just in time.</i>

54:37.667 --> 54:40.659
<i>Oh, lord, your mercy
knows no bounds.</i>

54:40.792 --> 54:42.953
<i>For shame
that I almost fell so easily.</i>

56:35.042 --> 56:36.998
<i>I should have expected resistance.</i>

56:38.750 --> 56:40.957
<i>Nothing worthwhile comes easily.</i>

57:03.500 --> 57:04.910
<i>Amanda.</i>

57:05.042 --> 57:07.249
<i>Amanda, Amanda.</i>

57:07.375 --> 57:08.865
<i>You called to me, Amanda.</i>

57:10.125 --> 57:12.036
<i>It was no small thing.</i>

57:12.167 --> 57:13.657
<i>It meant something.</i>

57:16.750 --> 57:18.240
<i>Never waste your pain.</i>

57:19.208 --> 57:21.620
<i>Never waste your pain.</i>

58:30.333 --> 58:32.790
Beautiful.

58:32.917 --> 58:33.917
Mm.

58:37.333 --> 58:39.915
- Do you mind if I sit?
- Hm? Course not.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.367
Oh, you don't work at St. Afras,
do you?

58:49.500 --> 58:50.956
Oh, no, no. I'm a private carer.

58:51.583 --> 58:53.119
Oh, right.

58:53.833 --> 58:57.371
I have a friend who works at St. Afras
and I wondered if you knew her.

58:57.500 --> 58:59.331
Oh, their uniform is blue.

59:00.250 --> 59:03.322
I honestly have so much respect

59:03.458 --> 59:05.824
for anyone in the medical profession.

59:05.958 --> 59:07.323
Like, any area.

59:08.208 --> 59:10.824
I really think
it's the most important thing

59:10.958 --> 59:13.040
you can do with your life, almost.

59:14.208 --> 59:16.415
Thank you. That's so sweet.

59:16.542 --> 59:19.614
Yeah, it can be really rewarding.

59:19.750 --> 59:21.581
Not all that glamorous, but yeah.

59:22.667 --> 59:25.329
- I love it.
- I bet you get no time for yourself.

59:26.125 --> 59:28.366
Oh, it's fine. I have my own life.

59:28.500 --> 59:30.115
My own things.

59:30.250 --> 59:31.786
Got choir practice.

59:35.208 --> 59:38.405
This person you're with at the moment,
what's wrong with them?

59:38.542 --> 59:39.657
Oh, I'm...

59:41.167 --> 59:43.783
Not really supposed
to discuss the details.

59:43.917 --> 59:46.078
But you have a good relationship?
You get on with them?

59:46.208 --> 59:47.288
Mm, really well.

59:48.250 --> 59:51.242
I'm with a lovely lady at the minute.
Were good pals.

59:53.500 --> 59:56.037
That's one of the things
I love about the job.

59:56.167 --> 01:00:00.331
You find yourself quickly building
these quite meaningful relationships

01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:03.996
and, you know,
you're often right there

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.582
at a very important time
in peoples lives.

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:10.161
Yeah.

01:00:10.292 --> 01:00:12.499
Although that sometimes
makes things harder in the end.

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:13.865
When you have to leave?

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.615
No, when they die.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:20.865
I don't think I'll be with this one
much longer to be honest with you.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.365
Sadly...

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.162
That, as they say,

01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:26.953
is how the cookie crumbles.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.163
Oh, I'm Esther, by the way.
What's your name?

01:00:45.667 --> 01:00:47.248
What if I'm getting it all wrong?

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:52.996
What if you are smirking
or indifferent

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:55.662
or think me a clueless idiot
like that stupid woman?

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.074
Is that how Amanda
saw me all along?

01:02:59.292 --> 01:03:00.748
How will I know what to do?

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:46.243
Katie?

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:51.448
Katie, its Joy.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.365
There you are.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.331
Oh, sorry.
Did I get you out of bed?

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:06.287
- Mind if I come in?
- I'm busy.

01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:08.783
I'll be quick, I promise.
I'm just on my way to work.

01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:13.039
Thanks, love.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.250
Oh.

01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:19.368
This is nice.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.740
Cor, you ain't half tidy, are you?

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:30.957
I hope you don't mind.
I got your address from work.

01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:32.789
Just wanted to see how you are.

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.453
Oh, this is cool.

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:42.577
I like all this.

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.789
Sorry I could'nt see you
the other night.

01:05:45.917 --> 01:05:49.330
I was so shattered, I don't think
I would've been much fun.

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:50.994
I tried to call
but you didn't pick up.

01:05:52.958 --> 01:05:54.539
Want a ciggie?

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:00.744
How's work going?

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.749
Are you not
with a patient at the moment?

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:15.620
I've been feeling bad about the way
I reacted last time I saw you.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:18.039
I'm sure youre doing a great job.

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.039
You always did.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:22.087
And I know you put
a lot of pressure on yourself.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:28.243
What happened before,
it was'nt your fault. I know that.

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:31.039
You do too, right?

01:06:38.542 --> 01:06:40.328
What's going on, Katie?

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:44.240
Come on, you can tell me.

01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:49.405
Look, I know it's a bit late now,
but I wanted to tell you.

01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.790
We should have been there
before it all happened.

01:06:54.042 --> 01:06:56.249
We could see
you were struggling for a while.

01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:16.166
I know it feels like everyones
in their own little bubble.

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:20.664
But it does help to share.

01:07:39.667 --> 01:07:42.033
May the lord bless
and keep you, Joy.

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:44.288
You what?

01:07:45.375 --> 01:07:47.411
It was sweet of you to come
but you must'nt worry.

01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:50.908
You're right,
back then I was so lost.

01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:54.829
But now I am transformed

01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:57.870
and soon everyone will see.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.582
Right. Well, thats good.

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:05.450
Thank you, Joy.
Thank you for coming.

01:08:10.958 --> 01:08:13.119
Oh? Oh, right.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.535
Are you sure you're ok, then?

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:21.823
Oh, fuck, I should go, actually.

01:08:28.707 --> 01:08:30.868
I'm gonna come back later, all right?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.080
All right.

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:34.368
I'm really glad
things are looking up.

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:36.792
See you later.

01:11:48.792 --> 01:11:51.033
I'm so sorry.

01:11:51.167 --> 01:11:53.829
I was unkind to you.

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:57.075
You made me think of things
I did'nt want to.

01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:01.452
It's all right.

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:04.536
- No.
- It is, Amanda.

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:07.703
The lord forgives that
which is said in anger.

01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:10.999
He knows your heart.

01:12:11.125 --> 01:12:12.490
The lord.

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:13.865
Yes, god.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:17.490
God sent me to you.

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:20.998
He forgives everything.

01:12:22.625 --> 01:12:24.661
You only have to ask.

01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:33.490
Heavenly father...

01:12:33.625 --> 01:12:35.536
- No, no.
- Bless this woman in her pain.

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:38.867
No, none of that nonsense.

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:46.708
Amanda?

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:57.780
You must be the loneliest girl
I've ever seen.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.410
I'm here, Amanda.

01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:05.157
I am not alone.

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:08.073
And neither are you.

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.448
No.

01:13:09.583 --> 01:13:12.199
Snap out of it, honey.

01:13:17.417 --> 01:13:18.623
He is'nt real.

01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:21.657
You must know that.

01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:25.702
No.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:28.199
You felt him too, remember?

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:30.164
We both did.

01:13:30.292 --> 01:13:31.372
No, honey.

01:13:32.792 --> 01:13:34.453
I did'nt.

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:38.323
That's not true.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:43.864
You have no idea
how dull it is to be dying.

01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:54.282
I hate to be the one to break it to you
but it's just you and me here.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.332
Nothing you do matters.

01:14:10.333 --> 01:14:12.699
Well, that was easy.

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.456
Devil.

01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:32.159
Take responsibility for your actions.

01:14:32.292 --> 01:14:35.534
You came back here
because you are alone.

01:14:35.667 --> 01:14:37.874
If you were a true believer,
he would be enough

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.948
but it's clear now
you are as weak as your faith.

01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:38.241
- Somebody stop her!
- Hey, love!

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:42.449
- Oh, my god!
- No, no, no, don't!
