WEBVTT

00:07.398 --> 00:10.271
Previously onYoung Sheldon...Dr. Sturgis will be

00:10.314 --> 00:11.750
joining us for dinner.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.056
I thought he was
in the nuthouse.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.492
We do not call it that.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.190
That's what Dad calls it.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.713
For starters,

00:17.756 --> 00:20.020
do not bring up his time
in the hospital.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.978
In The Shining,
Jack Nicholson goes nuts

00:22.022 --> 00:23.719
and chases people
around with an ax.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.724
When them elevator doors opened,
oh, man.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.944
Strike!Yeah!

00:33.163 --> 00:34.251
All right, Missy!

00:34.295 --> 00:36.732
Humiliate that boy!

00:36.775 --> 00:37.994
Shelly, why don't
you put your book down

00:38.038 --> 00:39.126
and watch your sister play?

00:39.169 --> 00:40.823
MEEMAW:
It's getting exciting.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.086
It looks like everyone's
just standing there.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.697
There's two outs,
bases are loaded,

00:45.741 --> 00:47.395
a-and the winning run's
on second.

00:47.438 --> 00:50.833
But if Missy throws one
more strike, they'll win.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.095
And then we can go home?

00:52.139 --> 00:53.836
That isexciting.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.059
UMPIRE:
Ball three! Full count!

01:02.410 --> 01:03.889
Hold on. Time!

01:03.933 --> 01:06.066
What are you doing down
there? Pray for her.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.502
Right. On it.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.504
What the heck's going on?

01:09.547 --> 01:12.289
I'm gonna lose the game.
Everyone's gonna hate me.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.986
Listen to me.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.597
Just throw the ball
over the plate.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.381
This guy's not gonna swing.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.122
Yes, he will.
He's their best hitter.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.037
DALE: Oh. Now, you
trust me, all right?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.605
He is looking to walk.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.911
He doesn't want to strike out
against a girl.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.392
You sure?

01:28.436 --> 01:30.916
Absolutely.
Just throw it across the plate.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.918
He will not swing.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.095
Okay.
Come on.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.053
Here. Wipe your nose.

01:39.838 --> 01:40.970
That a girl.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.233
Now, you got this.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.061
BOY: Come on, Missy!
He can't hit!

01:45.105 --> 01:47.063
WOMAN:
You can do it!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.152
UMPIRE:
Play ball!

02:08.389 --> 02:09.433
Strike three!

02:10.130 --> 02:11.261
That's my girl!

02:12.480 --> 02:13.742
Oh, my gosh.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.309
You said he wasn't gonna swing!

02:15.352 --> 02:17.180
I lied. Hey, we won!

02:17.224 --> 02:18.312
Let's get pizza!

02:18.355 --> 02:19.835
Come on!

02:21.402 --> 02:24.274
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:24.318 --> 02:27.103
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

02:27.147 --> 02:29.584
♪ I bet I could be your hero

02:29.627 --> 02:32.021
♪ I am a mighty little man

02:32.064 --> 02:36.068
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

02:42.988 --> 02:44.599
Oh, hey.

02:44.642 --> 02:47.036
Thank you.
Everybody, dig in.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.864
Fun fact: did you
know that pizza

02:48.907 --> 02:51.301
is only one of many
Mediterranean flatbreads?

02:53.390 --> 02:55.131
You talking to me?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.742
Shelly, this is Mr. Ballard's
first time eating with us.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.091
Let's make sure
it's not his last.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.267
Interesting.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.094
Does a family meal
mark an escalation

03:02.138 --> 03:04.314
in your romantic
relationship?

03:04.358 --> 03:06.490
That's a good question.
Does it?

03:08.275 --> 03:09.885
MEEMAW:
You know what?

03:09.928 --> 03:12.322
Why don't you go sit at
the kid table with your sister?

03:12.366 --> 03:15.151
Where do I begin? They're loud,
they're sweaty from sports...

03:15.195 --> 03:16.805
Get.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.071
BILLY:
Hey, Sheldon,

03:22.114 --> 03:23.899
if your pizza's too hot,
put ice on it.

03:23.942 --> 03:24.900
That's what I did.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.470
DALE:
So, George,

03:29.513 --> 03:30.819
how do I convince this one
to come fishing

03:30.862 --> 03:32.342
with me next weekend?

03:32.386 --> 03:34.605
I told you, nobody's
gonna see this face

03:34.649 --> 03:36.172
after a night in a tent.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.565
GEORGE SR.:
Mm. Smart.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.741
You don't want that
mug scaring the fish.

03:39.784 --> 03:40.872
Where you going?

03:40.916 --> 03:43.005
Lake Conroe.
Ooh.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.789
Great spot for catfish.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.530
Well, then,
why don't you come along?

03:46.574 --> 03:49.229
You can even bring Georgie
if you want to.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.708
That'd be fun.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.668
That sounds fun.
Uh, Mary, you mind if I go?

03:53.711 --> 03:55.060
A bed all to myself?

03:55.104 --> 03:56.279
Bye.DALE: Ah.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.541
It's a plan.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.761
You got to remember

03:59.804 --> 04:03.155
to hoist your food up into the
trees so this one can't get it.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.766
Very funny.You make fun of my face,

04:04.809 --> 04:09.205
I'm gonna have to make fun of
your enormous, bear-like body.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.208
So, how are you enjoying
your first meal with our family?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.950
Well, everybody's mean.
I love it.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.653
Hello.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.307
STURGIS :
George? John here.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.570
I'm calling to confirm a time

04:26.614 --> 04:29.312
for beer and socializing
this weekend.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.923
Oh, damn.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.230
I forgot we had plans. Um...

04:34.274 --> 04:36.232
I'm actually going camping.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.320
Okay.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.887
I'm real sorry.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.151
Uh, the invitation
kind of came up last minute.

04:42.194 --> 04:46.895
You may not know this,
but, um, I love camping.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.592
Really?STURGIS: Oh, yes.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.813
I spent a year
backpacking through Asia.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.772
I mean, I'd invite you along,
but it's not really my trip.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.907
I'm going with
Connie's friend Dale.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.909
Not a problem.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.433
I'll just hang out with
another friend this weekend.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.392
Great.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.743
I just need to make one first.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.832
Ballard's.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.442
GEORGE SR.:
Hey, Dale. It's George.

05:12.486 --> 05:15.793
About this weekend, uh,
we're gonna have to bow out.

05:15.837 --> 05:18.143
Why? Everything okay?

05:18.187 --> 05:20.450
Yeah. Yeah, I just forgot
I made plans with a friend,

05:20.494 --> 05:23.148
and I feel bad canceling
last minute.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.194
Oh, hey, can we--
Does he like camping?

05:25.237 --> 05:26.804
Bring-bring him along.

05:26.848 --> 05:30.591
Uh, y-- That might be
a little weird.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.810
It-it's Connie's ex.

05:32.854 --> 05:35.683
Boy, he didn't impress me
as a camping type.

05:35.726 --> 05:38.250
Uh, well, actually, he was
hinting around about going.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.817
Claims to be an outdoorsman.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.690
Really? Oh, hey,
I'd like to see that.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.387
Bring him along.You sure?

05:44.431 --> 05:45.823
Yeah. Hell,

05:45.867 --> 05:47.390
if we get caught
in a freak snowstorm,

05:47.434 --> 05:49.174
he'll be the first one we eat.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.915
Be like an appetizer.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.439
MISSY:
Why can't I go fishing?

05:52.482 --> 05:54.092
It's a boys' weekend.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.703
Then why isn't
Sheldon going?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.922
Do you hear yourself?Do you?

05:57.966 --> 06:00.316
Well, since they get to do
something fun, why can't we?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.492
Ooh, Chuck E. Cheese.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.451
That place is a nightmare.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.930
Something that could be
fun is the Museum of...

06:05.974 --> 06:08.368
No.Let him finish.

06:08.411 --> 06:11.153
We already heard "museum."
It's not gonna get better.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.547
The Museum of
the American Railroad.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.157
Oh, yeah, that's worse.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.288
GEORGE JR.:
Suddenly, camping

06:16.332 --> 06:18.290
with Dr. Sturgis
doesn't seem so bad.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.380
Uh, excuse me--
camping with who?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.948
Whoa. Dale didn't
mention it?

06:23.992 --> 06:25.385
No.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.561
I'm guessing
John didn't mention it.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.432
No.
Hmm.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.173
And when were you
gonna mention it?

06:31.216 --> 06:33.131
Oh, I was never
gonna mention it.

06:39.442 --> 06:43.098
So John, I hear you're going
camping this weekend.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.404
I am.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.144
With the guy I'm dating.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.494
I know.

06:47.537 --> 06:50.584
It was so nice of him
to let me tag along.

06:50.627 --> 06:53.195
And don't you think that's
gonna be a little awkward?

06:53.238 --> 06:55.763
No more awkward than
any other social situation

06:55.806 --> 06:57.721
I find myself in.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.157
I'm making

06:59.201 --> 07:01.595
my, uh, homemade GORP:

07:01.638 --> 07:04.467
good old raisins and peanuts.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.164
I'll have to give you
the recipe.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.992
I think I can figure it out.

07:08.036 --> 07:10.473
Listen, I want
to warn you about Dale.

07:10.517 --> 07:14.477
He's kind of a... guy's guy.

07:14.521 --> 07:18.481
Sometimes his sense of humor
can be a little mean-spirited.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.310
Just don't let it
hurt your feelings.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.355
Well, you don't
have to worry about me.

07:23.399 --> 07:27.664
We physicists are no strangers
to smack talk.

07:27.708 --> 07:32.016
I once told Dr. Linkletter he
wouldn't know a randomized trial

07:32.060 --> 07:34.628
if it crawled up his sphincter.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.368
MEEMAW :
Do not be a jerk to John.

07:36.412 --> 07:37.761
Oh, why would I be a jerk?

07:37.805 --> 07:39.328
You're gonna be camping.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.764
You're gonna be in the woods.
You're gonna be drinking.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.723
You're a jerk
without any of that.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.159
Don't worry.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.161
I know how to get along
with people.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.859
Knowing how and doing it
are two different things.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.819
Okay, okay. I-I'll be nice.

07:51.862 --> 07:54.082
Thank you.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.823
To your goofy little friend.

08:03.874 --> 08:07.138
That's Dale.
We're gonna head out.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.966
Here's some coffee for the road.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.533
Thanks.Make sure your dad

08:10.577 --> 08:11.795
doesn't drink
too many beers.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.275
You're funny.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.582
And make sure your son
doesn't drink any beers.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.279
Got it. I'll finish 'em all.
Let's go.

08:19.020 --> 08:22.197
MARY:
Be safe. Have fun.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.591
Oh, I'm free.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.507
GEORGE SR.:
This sure is a sweet setup.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.334
DALE:
Well, now,
thank you very much.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.293
This thing is nicer
than our house.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.599
It's not nicer
than our house.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.209
DALE:
Well, don't be
too sure now.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.864
I got microwave
and air-conditioning.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.823
I got a stack of old Playboys
back there in the bathroom.

08:40.868 --> 08:41.956
Okay, maybe.

08:43.653 --> 08:44.698
Hey, there's John up here

08:44.741 --> 08:46.830
on the right.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.093
Are you sure that's not
a garden gnome?

08:52.401 --> 08:55.012
Missy, how would you feel
if there were somewhere

08:55.056 --> 08:57.449
just like Chuck E. Cheese, but
instead of pizza and ball pits,

08:57.493 --> 08:59.321
there was locomotives
and placards

08:59.364 --> 09:00.540
explaining their history?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.193
That's just the museum.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.978
I didn't think
she'd see through that.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.244
So, Johnny, that's quite
the outfit you got on there.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.724
Thanks.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.944
I just got one question.
Where do the merit badges go?

09:15.119 --> 09:17.339
Because I look like a Boy Scout?

09:17.382 --> 09:19.471
Yeah, that's kind of
the joke there.

09:21.125 --> 09:25.129
Well, I accept your jocular
insult as a token of bonding.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.001
Well, if you like that one,
how about this?

09:27.044 --> 09:29.525
Uh, I haven't seen legs
that white since...

09:29.569 --> 09:32.441
Hey. Why don't we talk
about something else?

09:32.484 --> 09:34.878
George, it's all right.
You don't need to protect me.

09:34.922 --> 09:38.099
I can take it,
and I can dish it right back.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.579
DALE:
Oh, yeah?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.015
Well, bring it on, babe.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.495
Hmm.

09:43.539 --> 09:46.803
It would help if I knew
a little more about you.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.545
Were you, by chance,
a bed wetter?

09:51.982 --> 09:55.420
I know it's been a while, but
I really have to talk to you.

09:55.464 --> 09:59.120
I understand you might not want
to hear about my dating life,

09:59.163 --> 10:03.603
but if you hadn't died,
I wouldn't be in this situation.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.735
So this is on you.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.744
How about a movie?How about the planetarium?

10:14.788 --> 10:15.963
That's like a movie,

10:16.006 --> 10:18.182
where you can see real stars
instead of,

10:18.226 --> 10:19.575
I don't know, Gene Kelly?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.403
We're never gonna agree.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.231
Let's just do
rock, paper, scissors.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.886
No. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that players familiar

10:25.929 --> 10:28.715
with each other will tie
75% of the time

10:28.758 --> 10:30.804
due to the limited number
of outcomes.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.893
Well, what if we added
a few more choices?

10:32.936 --> 10:36.548
Like, rock, paper,
scissors, candy, pony.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.812
Now you're just being silly.

10:38.855 --> 10:39.987
But your idea
of a winner-takes-all

10:40.030 --> 10:41.815
competition is a good one.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.425
We just need to come up
with something

10:43.468 --> 10:44.992
that is fair to both of us.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.123
Ooh.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.472
What if we list all the spices

10:47.516 --> 10:49.257
in Mom's spice rack
alphabetically?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.911
I'll go first. Adobo.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.043
Black pepper. Cinnamon.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.002
Coriander. Cumin.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.178
We're not playing
the spice game.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.396
Dill.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.097
So now I have these
two guys in my life.

11:03.140 --> 11:06.796
And I know that might sound
like bragging, but at my age,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.539
if you are single and not
hooked to an oxygen tank,

11:10.582 --> 11:13.411
you got to swat 'em away.

11:17.111 --> 11:20.636
I'm still pissed at you
for dying.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.595
I'm not gonna just sit at home
and miss you.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.685
I mean, you wouldn't want that.

11:25.728 --> 11:29.384
You'd want me to go out
and have fun, right?

11:30.907 --> 11:33.693
Take your time, think about it.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.566
GEORGE SR.:
Damn, John.

11:37.609 --> 11:40.047
Three already?
What are you using for bait?

11:40.090 --> 11:42.179
I made it myself. It's, uh,

11:42.223 --> 11:46.183
cheese, garlic and a
little bit of pig brains.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.925
Pig brains? Where the hell
you get pig brains?

11:48.969 --> 11:50.535
From the butcher.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.190
But you get some odd looks
when you ask for it.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.628
You get odd looks?
Oh, I find that hard to believe.

11:56.672 --> 11:57.412
Like this.

11:59.675 --> 12:02.156
I think he's
pulling your leg, John.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.985
Oh, I see.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.291
Meaning I get
odd looks

12:07.335 --> 12:09.293
all the time.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.252
That's funny.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.776
Well, if anyone wants

12:13.820 --> 12:17.258
to try my bait,
uh, you're welcome to.

12:17.301 --> 12:18.433
Sure.Yeah, I'll give her a go.

12:18.476 --> 12:19.608
Dale?

12:19.651 --> 12:21.784
No, I think I know
how to fish, John.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.612
Really? 'Cause it doesn't
look like it.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.048
Well, maybe that's because
all your talking

12:25.092 --> 12:26.615
is scaring the fish away.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.792
Evidence suggests
your theory is incorrect.

12:29.836 --> 12:33.796
Well, evidence suggests
I need another beer.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.628
Not that bad.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.283
Oh, that's nice.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.633
You decided to stay home
and play a game?

12:44.676 --> 12:46.069
Nope. We're inventing
a new game,

12:46.113 --> 12:48.028
and the winner gets
to pick what we do today.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.681
We had to find a way
to make sure

12:49.725 --> 12:50.987
that it's completely fair
to both of us.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.467
So we made a list
of 20 challenges

12:52.510 --> 12:54.382
that combine stuff
we're both good at.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.992
Whoever wins each challenge
gets to take a block

12:56.036 --> 12:57.385
and put it on top
of their tower.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.300
Whoever's tower
reaches the height

12:59.343 --> 13:01.650
of this rocket first wins.

13:01.693 --> 13:05.219
Okay, I will leave you to it.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.788
"And finally, both parties agree
the loser will do the activity

13:08.831 --> 13:11.442
"selected by the winner
graciously, without complaint.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.183
"For the purpose
of this agreement,

13:13.227 --> 13:16.012
"a complaint is defined
as any disparaging comment,

13:16.056 --> 13:19.015
"eye rolls or name calling,
including but not limited to:

13:19.059 --> 13:22.366
'dingus,' 'fartbreath'
and 'buttwipe.'"

13:22.410 --> 13:25.108
Can we just sign it and play?

13:25.152 --> 13:27.807
I've signed my name.
Feel free to draw an "X."

13:27.850 --> 13:30.853
I know how to write
my name, Sheldon.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.637
Damn it, I wrote "Sheldon."

13:34.248 --> 13:36.424
So, Dale is fun.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.252
Kind of a good old boy.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.384
Reminds me a bit of you.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.386
He gets on my nerves.

13:42.430 --> 13:46.129
So he kind of reminds me of you.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.089
And John's not anything
like you.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.309
He's not anything like anyone.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.313
Maybe that's why I keep
thinking about him.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.185
Fun fact:

13:58.228 --> 14:02.102
in Finland, they make a
fire that's two long logs

14:02.145 --> 14:04.408
sitting on top of each
other with a wedge

14:04.452 --> 14:08.891
of wood in between
to let the air flow through.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.067
Aw. That's your idea
of fun, is it?

14:12.503 --> 14:13.853
Mind if I grab a beer?

14:13.896 --> 14:15.942
I'm not your father.Hold on.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.292
This young man's
underage.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.163
So?So the laws

14:20.207 --> 14:23.036
of Texas are pretty clear
on the subject.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.081
Oh, what a surprise.
There's one more thing

14:25.125 --> 14:27.736
you know more about
than everybody else.

14:27.779 --> 14:30.260
I don't know
why you're surprised.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.045
I don't know why you're here.

14:32.088 --> 14:35.135
I'm just gonna stick
with Dr Pepper.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.877
Why don't you get
some more firewood, Georgie?

14:37.920 --> 14:38.878
Thank you.

14:40.183 --> 14:43.186
I'm here because my friend
George invited me.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.319
Uh-huh.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.930
Well, your friend George
invited you

14:47.974 --> 14:49.889
because he felt sorry for you.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.981
You know, Connie warned me
you might behave like this,

14:55.024 --> 14:57.592
and she-she was right.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.290
I don't know why the hell
she ever went out with you.

15:00.334 --> 15:04.294
Well, she did,
and we got along famously.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.907
Until you broke up with her
after you got out of...

15:07.950 --> 15:09.560
Out of what?

15:11.258 --> 15:12.824
Say it!

15:16.263 --> 15:17.960
Never mind.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.397
Damn. Piddled on my shoe.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.138
What'd I miss?

15:23.444 --> 15:26.360
So enough about me.
How about you?

15:26.403 --> 15:29.841
You got your wings yet,
or is that just in the movies?

15:29.885 --> 15:31.843
KENNETH:
It's a Wonderful Life.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.020
That's one of my favorites.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.109
Ah, sorry. I didn't see you.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.545
I'll keep it down.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.764
No, it's all right. I, uh...

15:39.808 --> 15:42.376
talk to my wife all the time.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.812
I'm Kenneth.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.728
This is Vanessa.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.426
Connie. This is Charlie.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.429
I'd introduce them,
but they're neighbors.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.040
They probably know each other.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.044
Well, if he complains
about someone snoring,

15:58.087 --> 16:00.133
I'm sure it's her.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.005
I didn't bury him with
his hearing aid, so he's fine.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.661
Well, you know what? I'll, um...

16:06.704 --> 16:10.882
I'll come back in a few minutes,
and let you finish your chat.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.449
Really nice meeting you, Connie.

16:12.493 --> 16:13.885
You, too.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.151
You see?

16:18.194 --> 16:20.370
Got to swat 'em away.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.244
Okay. Each player alternates

16:24.287 --> 16:25.941
naming a state
while Hula-Hooping.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.290
The first player
who can't name a state

16:27.334 --> 16:28.900
or drops the Hula-Hoop loses.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.119
Ready,

16:30.163 --> 16:31.729
set,

16:31.773 --> 16:32.774
go.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.384
Texas.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.603
Darn it.

16:35.646 --> 16:36.604
So I won?

16:36.647 --> 16:38.127
Yes.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.564
Good. 'Cause I was just
gonna say "Texas" again.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.606
Gentlemen.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.828
I'm no longer
enjoying this outing,

17:26.871 --> 17:28.395
so I'm going home.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.049
See ya.H-Hang on, Dale.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.181
John, y-- wait,
you can't just leave.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.487
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.966
Not a problem.

17:35.010 --> 17:39.493
I have my compass, a flashlight
and half a bag of GORP.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.842
GEORGE SR.:
No, wait, wait.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.540
Please.Let him go, George.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.108
You want to tell Connie you lost
her old boyfriend in the woods?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.936
Well, he's a grown man
for crying out loud.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.372
Let him do what he wants.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.200
Well, that's an argument
for me having a beer.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.636
Shut up. Come on, Dale.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.595
Do the right thing.
Tell him to stay.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.859
Fine.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.469
John?

18:00.514 --> 18:02.472
Oh, damn.

18:02.516 --> 18:05.127
John!

18:05.171 --> 18:07.912
Boy, for a little guy,
he's fast, ain't he?

18:16.747 --> 18:17.835
I win.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.620
You can't set it that way.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.143
Does it say that in the rules?

18:21.187 --> 18:23.102
Well, no.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.581
And is this your signature?

18:24.625 --> 18:25.669
Yes, but...

18:25.713 --> 18:27.497
Mom, we're going
to Chuck E. Cheese!

18:27.541 --> 18:29.978
We're not going anywhere.
It's almost your bedtime.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.502
Sorry, hon.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.247
Well, all that matters
is that I'm the winner.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.945
Yes, you are.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.034
ADULT SHELDON:
Actually, I was the winner.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.907
We spent the whole day
doing everything I love:

18:45.950 --> 18:48.736
drafting contracts,
arguing about rules,

18:48.779 --> 18:52.043
and most importantly,
never leaving the house.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.790
Come on.I don't want to.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.922
Just one more time.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.533
Fine.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.188
BOTH:
Rock, paper, scissors,
candy, pony!

19:06.232 --> 19:08.799
Rock trips pony. I win.

19:08.843 --> 19:09.800
How do you keep winning?

19:09.844 --> 19:11.367
You keep picking pony.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.202
GORP?
