00:00.285 --> 00:02.269
You will need to find
the Book of Leaves.

00:02.270 --> 00:03.955
And you are closer every day.

00:04.022 --> 00:06.991
Lorenzo makes an embassy
to the Duke of Urbino.

00:08.729 --> 00:09.830
Brilliant!

00:09.898 --> 00:12.567
He seeks to create a
new military alliance.

00:12.635 --> 00:14.395
It's too long since I
led my men into combat.

00:14.437 --> 00:16.539
Our proposal
is timely indeed.

00:16.607 --> 00:18.408
End the House of Medici.

00:18.475 --> 00:20.342
Before I end you.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.410
Those caught roaming
the streets after curfew

00:22.478 --> 00:24.245
get put in my little book.

00:24.313 --> 00:26.322
Anyone who breaks curfew,
for the slightest reason,

00:26.347 --> 00:27.382
will be put down here.

00:27.383 --> 00:30.151
Including the true spy whom you
believe framed Becchi.

00:30.219 --> 00:32.354
You've seen what happens
when people question

00:32.421 --> 00:35.056
the plans of the Vatican,
haven't you?

00:35.123 --> 00:38.025
Giuliano, you'd make a
fine husband for Camilla.

00:39.027 --> 00:40.261
The key.

00:40.329 --> 00:42.463
It's waiting in Rome.

00:42.530 --> 00:45.532
Your mother,
she's alive.

He's alone.

02:09.186 --> 02:11.120
For the first time in days.

02:13.791 --> 02:15.292
See for yourself, Zo.

02:15.359 --> 02:16.960
Careful.

02:17.028 --> 02:18.662
The lenses
are delicately balanced.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.901
Why is he here while the rest of
the city's busy with the carnival.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.936
What's the name
on that headstone?

02:27.506 --> 02:29.173
I can't make it out.

02:29.241 --> 02:30.508
The lenses
can be adjusted.

02:30.576 --> 02:31.843
Here.

02:38.651 --> 02:41.753
<i>Celia Lysimachus.</i>

02:41.821 --> 02:43.154
That's a Jewish surname.

02:43.222 --> 02:45.991
Explains why she's buried
in a pauper's graveyard.

02:47.726 --> 02:49.594
<i>Who is she?</i>

02:49.662 --> 02:51.462
<i>And what is she to Riario?</i>

02:51.530 --> 02:53.832
Maybe only gets stiff
for the stiff.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.468
You might be right.

02:56.536 --> 02:58.137
He's on the move.

02:58.205 --> 03:01.140
Maestro, look, we've been
following Riario for days.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.008
- If he sees us...
- He won't.

03:03.076 --> 03:06.245
Leo, while I'm not about to piss down
my leg, I have to side with Nico.

03:06.313 --> 03:09.649
The Abyssinian claimed the other
key's here but look around.

03:11.551 --> 03:13.986
Rome's been growing for
thousands of years.

03:14.054 --> 03:17.623
An object looking for a place to hide
couldn't have chosen a better home.

03:17.691 --> 03:19.892
Indeed. And that's why
we're going to liberate it

03:19.959 --> 03:22.795
from the one place Riario would
expect it to be safe.

03:24.097 --> 03:26.731
The Vatican's
Secret Archives.

03:46.485 --> 03:50.855
Remember, man, that thou art dust
and unto dust thou shalt return.

03:57.161 --> 04:00.230
Turn away from sin,
Clarice.

04:00.297 --> 04:02.731
And be faithful
to the Gospel.

04:02.799 --> 04:05.234
I try, brother.

04:05.301 --> 04:10.104
As Matthew urges, I pray
for those who persecute me.

04:17.046 --> 04:20.815
Remember, man, that thou art dust
and unto dust thou shalt return.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.967
I've got the guard rotations
for the south entrance.

04:37.034 --> 04:39.870
Tight as a nun
on Good Friday.

04:41.939 --> 04:44.041
We've examined every
entrance, window,

04:44.108 --> 04:45.375
tunnel,
hole in the bloody wall.

04:45.443 --> 04:47.477
Getting in uncaught
is impossible.

04:47.545 --> 04:50.881
You do realize 'impossible' is just a
word that makes me try even harder.

04:50.948 --> 04:53.417
Maestro, sentries patrol every
possible entrance.

04:53.484 --> 04:55.386
In fact,
here come two now.

05:03.062 --> 05:04.429
Don't worry, my friends.

05:04.496 --> 05:06.264
Long as they think you're Jews
here in the ghetto,

05:06.332 --> 05:08.333
you have nothing to fear.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.009
As Jews we are
beneath notice.

05:20.579 --> 05:23.914
You see, they pay no attention
because you wear the yellow.

05:23.982 --> 05:26.950
Thank you
for taking us in.

05:27.018 --> 05:29.753
Even if you are not out to
undermine our oppressors,

05:29.821 --> 05:32.055
friends of Zo
are always welcome

05:32.123 --> 05:34.024
because he has so few.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.528
What about the Castel Sant Angelo
that connects to the Vatican?

05:38.596 --> 05:41.265
If I can devise a way
to reach the tower...

05:41.333 --> 05:43.233
Leo, listen.
Just listen to me.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.768
It's a prison.

05:44.835 --> 05:48.105
Okay? Did you enjoy your time
in the Bargello that much

05:48.172 --> 05:49.539
you're homesick
for iron bars?

05:49.607 --> 05:54.178
These are the people who put
me behind those bars, Zo.

05:54.246 --> 05:56.815
And they will pay
for their folly.

06:04.058 --> 06:06.459
See you. Farewell.

06:06.527 --> 06:08.762
Niccolo.

06:08.829 --> 06:12.665
Your wife Lucrezia, she is
a believer, is she not?

06:12.733 --> 06:14.200
She is, Your Magnificence.

06:14.268 --> 06:16.803
Well, is she unwell?
I've not seen her of late.

06:16.871 --> 06:19.806
She's been caring
for an aunt in Siena.

06:19.874 --> 06:23.876
I'd hoped she'd be here by now
but perhaps God has other plans.

06:23.944 --> 06:25.878
Your Excellency,

06:25.946 --> 06:30.850
would it be impertinent of me to
say you wear your ashes well?

06:32.453 --> 06:34.987
I like my women
with a bit of cheek.

06:38.091 --> 06:40.092
Gathered all the curfew
ledgers as I asked?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.728
- I have, signor.
- Excellent.

06:41.795 --> 06:43.430
Bring them to
my quarters.

06:43.497 --> 06:45.999
Oh, Francesco,
Francesco.

06:46.067 --> 06:47.567
Buone Feste.

06:49.571 --> 06:50.971
Let us heal old wounds.

06:51.039 --> 06:54.174
Yes, and put old feuds
to death.

06:54.242 --> 06:56.676
We look forward to the
union of our families.

06:56.744 --> 06:59.913
Assuming we can work out
the terms of the dowry.

06:59.981 --> 07:01.916
He jests.

07:01.983 --> 07:04.318
I'm sure it will sort out.

07:04.386 --> 07:06.687
Since you've extended
the first laurel,

07:06.755 --> 07:09.590
we'd like to host an engagement
fete for the families

07:09.658 --> 07:11.092
at our country estate.

07:11.159 --> 07:13.394
A Lord's supper
for Holy Saturday.

07:13.462 --> 07:15.063
This is good news,
Francesco.

07:15.131 --> 07:19.067
This is good for Florence and
this is good for us all.

07:19.135 --> 07:22.404
- Till Holy Saturday then.
- Indeed.

07:22.472 --> 07:23.939
Farewell.

07:26.109 --> 07:27.744
Well done.

07:27.811 --> 07:32.281
Now all you have to do is
break the news to Giuliano.

07:35.986 --> 07:39.154
Let's be clear on this: I get
no choice in this matter.

07:39.222 --> 07:41.824
None. Because you
are my brother,

07:41.891 --> 07:44.894
you get an explanation of
why you have no choice.

07:44.961 --> 07:47.763
Camilla Pazzi.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.564
You can't deny
she is attractive.

07:49.632 --> 07:53.402
If I needed a new mistress,
I'd bed her myself.

07:53.470 --> 07:57.239
The Pazzis have other marriageable
maidens without so much appeal.

07:58.675 --> 08:00.477
Clarice was looking
out for you.

08:00.544 --> 08:03.013
You decided all this and you
didn't even consult me?

08:03.081 --> 08:06.016
We thought that if the
Pazzis turned us down,

08:06.084 --> 08:08.018
we wouldn't have to
burden you with it.

08:08.086 --> 08:11.722
Easier to say from the seat of the
bidder rather than the bidded upon.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.894
Do you honestly believe
this can work?

08:16.962 --> 08:20.798
The Pazzis have been our foes since
the days of our ancestor Averardo.

08:20.866 --> 08:22.467
Feuds like that
don't just go away.

08:22.534 --> 08:24.902
This is precisely why
marriage was invented!

08:24.970 --> 08:28.572
To consolidate power
and to settle feuds.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.709
Yeah. I always knew
I'd pay for being me.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.618
Lucrezia. What are you
doing in Rome?

09:11.686 --> 09:14.020
<i>Who says we're in Rome?</i>

09:14.088 --> 09:16.990
How did I get here?

09:17.058 --> 09:19.593
I told you I loved you.

09:19.661 --> 09:22.963
So I found a way.

09:23.031 --> 09:24.598
And don't think
I didn't notice

09:24.666 --> 09:27.001
you haven't
answered my question.

09:30.205 --> 09:35.410
It is easier to resist at the
beginning than it is at the end.

09:38.280 --> 09:42.917
But then again, perhaps
you're not capable of love.

09:46.455 --> 09:51.826
You stay silent even when I've
given you my dearest possession.

09:53.428 --> 09:57.297
Can't you tell from this
what you mean to me?

09:57.365 --> 09:59.699
Can't you tell me
what I need to hear?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.668
I...

10:01.735 --> 10:05.872
Without love, there is
no point in living.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.535
Hey, hey! Rouse yourselves.
Rouse yourselves.

11:08.603 --> 11:10.803
I've discovered
a way into the Vatican.

11:10.871 --> 11:11.804
Bugger off.
You're still drunk.

11:11.872 --> 11:15.274
What is the one place,
the one entrance,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.977
where no guard
can be found?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.378
It's in the water.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.415
The sewers were built on the
principles of Vitruvius.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.816
Designed to flow freely
into the city,

11:23.884 --> 11:27.753
including
into the Vatican.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.288
Look, look.

11:29.356 --> 11:34.327
The air is delivered into the glass
and it allows the flame to live.

11:34.395 --> 11:37.063
Now I know you're besotted.
You won't fit inside there.

11:37.131 --> 11:42.169
Of course not, but we can construct
a device of similar properties.

11:42.236 --> 11:45.138
Look at these sketches.
Here. Here. Look.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.007
Look.

11:47.075 --> 11:48.342
It's a diving dress.

11:48.409 --> 11:52.279
It's modeled on the breathing
of a water turtle.

11:52.346 --> 11:56.383
Because the air goes
in through this line,

11:56.451 --> 11:59.119
and then it's exhaled
into this forward pouch.

11:59.187 --> 12:04.458
Look. We need to gather some
items and do it quickly.

12:04.526 --> 12:06.961
We've only got
a few days.

12:07.028 --> 12:08.863
- There.
- Pig's skin, glass...

12:08.930 --> 12:10.231
A fishing net...

12:10.298 --> 12:12.133
- A boat?
- Yes, a boat.

12:20.308 --> 12:23.044
Right.

12:23.112 --> 12:24.846
This is the spot.

12:28.050 --> 12:32.386
Okay, just continue operating
the mechanism at a steady pace

12:32.454 --> 12:35.756
until I reach
my destination.

12:35.824 --> 12:39.660
Once I'm there, I'll plug the end
of this line as signal to stop.

12:39.727 --> 12:43.063
Leo are you sure of this contraption?
We haven't tested it.

12:43.131 --> 12:46.901
There's no time if we're to remain undiscovered.
It's trial by fire.

12:46.968 --> 12:48.936
Or water, in this case.

12:49.004 --> 12:51.072
Just keep pumping
these bellows.

12:51.139 --> 12:55.109
With any luck, it'll take just a few
hours to get all the way inside.

12:55.177 --> 12:57.378
What if you're wrong
about where you'll emerge

12:57.446 --> 12:58.946
and you climb up
into a brigade?

12:59.014 --> 13:01.882
The plans of Vitruvius show
where the drains lead.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.684
Yes? Once I reach
the reservoir,

13:04.752 --> 13:09.155
I just drill up into
the Vatican flooring.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.956
If I don't reappear
by sundown,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.758
make your way back
to Florence without me.

13:12.826 --> 13:16.528
Sundown? Honestly?
What could take so long?

14:15.659 --> 14:18.694
Hey. Bell time.

14:18.762 --> 14:21.296
Bell.

14:21.364 --> 14:23.131
Another!

14:23.199 --> 14:25.767
Signor de Medici, we're about
to ring the bell for the night.

14:25.835 --> 14:29.004
Then bring me a barrel I can
roll home and drink all night.

14:29.072 --> 14:33.108
I need all the liquid
counseling I can get.

14:33.176 --> 14:37.813
Would you believe my brother pledged
me to marry a woman from...

14:37.880 --> 14:39.414
All right.

14:39.482 --> 14:42.083
Dragonetti's wolves will be
here for a round-up soon.

14:42.151 --> 14:44.552
<i>It's time to find</i>
<i>your beds.</i>

14:46.021 --> 14:48.389
You too,

14:48.457 --> 14:50.857
your grace.

14:53.561 --> 14:57.731
And what if I called your
bed my home for tonight?

15:25.428 --> 15:27.262
Sorry.

15:27.329 --> 15:29.363
Too much cider.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.401
Seems my cock doesn't
know what's good for him.

15:33.469 --> 15:35.604
Luckily I do.

16:12.744 --> 16:15.579
Strange noise.
Did you hear that?

16:15.647 --> 16:18.315
Zo, Zo.

16:33.697 --> 16:35.397
Is it down there?

16:48.710 --> 16:50.811
No, come on.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.513
Zo.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.882
I boiled you some quinto
quarto for your hangover.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.218
It works wonders.

18:03.286 --> 18:05.787
You're a saint.

18:05.855 --> 18:08.356
I think we disproved
that last night.

18:10.059 --> 18:12.027
Oh...

18:14.030 --> 18:16.732
There's something
you have to know.

18:16.799 --> 18:18.767
I'm betrothed.

18:18.835 --> 18:21.604
You mentioned it.

18:21.671 --> 18:24.307
A few times.

18:24.374 --> 18:28.778
I agreed to your advances precisely
because you're spoken for.

18:28.845 --> 18:32.515
If you were unattached and we
became enamored with each other,

18:32.583 --> 18:34.384
can you imagine
what might happen?

18:34.451 --> 18:37.620
A Medici
marries a commoner.

18:37.688 --> 18:39.823
Would it be so bad?

18:39.891 --> 18:41.859
Lady Vanessa?

18:41.926 --> 18:45.529
Your palace is a prison
with better linens.

18:45.597 --> 18:49.367
Every move is watched,
every action judged.

18:49.435 --> 18:51.937
My choices might be
limited here,

18:52.004 --> 18:55.373
but I answer
to no-one but myself.

18:55.441 --> 18:59.711
Why don't I sack it all and come and
live with you on your side of things?

19:02.081 --> 19:03.815
Without the Medici
hand governing,

19:03.883 --> 19:05.617
I'd still be living
a lie in the convent.

19:05.684 --> 19:08.586
It would have been
a gentle lie,

19:08.654 --> 19:10.489
a lie lived
among friends...

19:10.556 --> 19:11.990
Oh.

19:12.058 --> 19:15.860
But if I marry Camilla
Pazzi, that's a lie too.

19:15.928 --> 19:20.098
When you marry her, you
neutralize that family of fiends.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.002
And when ruling Florence
gets to be too much,

19:24.070 --> 19:28.440
you and I can still snatch a
little freedom here and there.

19:30.276 --> 19:31.810
You know this
makes good sense.

19:33.912 --> 19:35.413
Something else stops you.

19:35.481 --> 19:37.916
I blame the Pazzis
for Becchi's death.

19:37.984 --> 19:40.518
They set him up somehow.

19:40.586 --> 19:42.921
Along with Rome
and their spy.

19:42.988 --> 19:46.291
Well, then,
clear his name.

19:46.359 --> 19:50.495
And then the Pazzis will know just
what sort of man lives among them.

20:23.831 --> 20:27.534
Amen.

20:27.602 --> 20:31.172
May I present Federico
da Montefeltro,

20:31.239 --> 20:33.741
the Duke of Urbino.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.844
- Federico.
- Your Eminence.

20:36.912 --> 20:39.747
Thank you for travelling
so far, so quickly.

20:39.815 --> 20:41.416
Anything for
Your Holiness.

20:41.483 --> 20:43.985
I am but
a servant of God.

20:44.053 --> 20:47.322
And yet you ally yourself

20:47.390 --> 20:50.391
with your godson
Lorenzo de Medici against us.

20:50.459 --> 20:53.395
Do I?
A surprise to my ears.

20:53.462 --> 20:55.030
- Hm.
- I see.

20:55.098 --> 20:57.799
So you deny meeting
Lorenzo in your home

20:57.867 --> 21:00.302
to negotiate an alliance
against the Papal States?

21:00.370 --> 21:01.804
Please forgive my nephew.

21:01.871 --> 21:04.973
These rumors have
angered him greatly.

21:05.041 --> 21:07.443
No apologies necessary.

21:07.510 --> 21:09.144
If I'd heard similar,
I'd react the same.

21:09.212 --> 21:10.946
Or worse.

21:11.013 --> 21:14.450
5,000 gold florins to fight
for us against the Medicis.

21:18.054 --> 21:20.656
Now, apologies
are necessary.

21:20.723 --> 21:23.525
<i>You think Condottieri</i>
<i>kill only for money?</i>

21:23.593 --> 21:25.794
<i>Some I kill for pleasure.</i>

21:25.862 --> 21:30.966
Federico, let's have you refreshed
before we discuss our business.

21:31.033 --> 21:33.134
We shall reconvene after.

21:50.486 --> 21:51.786
<i>Signor?</i>

21:51.853 --> 21:54.521
<i>Signor de Medici?</i>

21:54.589 --> 21:56.958
<i>Who's there?</i>

21:57.025 --> 21:59.393
Signor de Medici
requested these lists.

21:59.461 --> 22:02.196
Dragonetti produced
the index of symbols?

22:02.264 --> 22:03.864
I had to invade his office
without his knowledge.

22:03.932 --> 22:06.334
I'll let you gentlemen
get to work.

22:06.401 --> 22:08.802
Somehow I never got to
my chores last night.

22:21.750 --> 22:25.086
- Signorina.
- Bye.

22:25.154 --> 22:27.621
Tell me. Who's Libra?

22:27.689 --> 22:28.789
I'm sorry, Eccellenza.

22:28.857 --> 22:31.024
It's the symbol
for Gentile Becchi.

22:31.092 --> 22:33.827
Libra, the scales
of justice.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.897
If only we can deliver
that to him.

22:36.965 --> 22:38.732
- Capricorn?
- Moses the physic.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.169
Understandable. Illness
respects no curfew.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.071
That leaves Gemini.
Who is he?

22:44.138 --> 22:46.673
I don't think our
conspirator is Gemini.

22:46.741 --> 22:50.410
That's the symbol for,
well...

22:50.478 --> 22:52.279
Lucrezia Donati?

22:52.346 --> 22:57.117
Forgive any indelicacy, but you surely
know why she's out late at night.

22:57.185 --> 22:58.519
I do.

22:58.586 --> 23:02.022
And yet, the week
we hired Da Vinci:

23:02.090 --> 23:04.324
- "Returning from Siena."
- Mm.

23:04.392 --> 23:06.960
I hear she's there now. She could
have been visiting relatives.

23:07.028 --> 23:09.462
She could
have traveled to Rome

23:09.530 --> 23:12.165
and alerted them of
our new war engineer.

23:12.232 --> 23:14.300
It's impossible.
She's a...woman.

23:14.368 --> 23:15.602
Exactly.

23:15.669 --> 23:18.471
Her liaisons with my
brother create an alibi.

23:18.539 --> 23:22.709
But we cannot ignore the possibility
that Lucrezia is a spy.

23:22.777 --> 23:23.977
Saddle the horses
for Siena.

23:24.045 --> 23:25.412
We'll question
her directly.

23:29.150 --> 23:31.184
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>gather round.</i>

23:35.957 --> 23:37.658
Bernardo Baroncelli.

23:37.725 --> 23:40.394
Jacomo Bracciolini.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.963
Condottiere
Giovan Battista.

23:43.031 --> 23:45.232
Renato Giustini.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.201
Father Bagnone.

23:48.269 --> 23:51.205
Father Maffei.

23:51.272 --> 23:55.275
Your Eminence,
Cardinal Orsini.

23:55.343 --> 23:57.544
Some may call us
conspirators.

23:57.612 --> 24:00.347
I say no.
Gentlemen,

24:00.414 --> 24:04.618
look upon each other as
saviors of our great city.

24:06.754 --> 24:09.256
Ahhh.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.626
And here's
our final savior.

24:12.694 --> 24:14.327
Gentlemen.

25:13.923 --> 25:16.091
- The front door was locked.
- Who dares?

25:16.159 --> 25:18.861
<i>Leonardo Da Vinci.</i>

25:18.928 --> 25:23.399
The man you sought
to have imprisoned...

25:25.068 --> 25:29.806
- ..and burned.
- The Florentine virtuoso.

25:29.873 --> 25:31.307
You make quite
an entrance.

25:31.375 --> 25:35.245
To ensure
a private audience.

25:35.313 --> 25:39.349
The Secret Archive,
if you please.

25:40.385 --> 25:42.420
As you wish.

25:50.129 --> 25:52.297
<i>I'm aware of</i>
<i>the guards outside.</i>

25:52.365 --> 25:55.067
<i>Surely a Secret Archive</i>

25:55.134 --> 25:57.903
<i>has an attendant</i>
<i>secret passageway.</i>

25:57.970 --> 25:59.805
Then find one.

25:59.872 --> 26:03.342
This palace was designed
by Nivolo Speziali, no?

26:03.409 --> 26:07.613
and his structures
are historically rife

26:07.680 --> 26:10.349
with hidden doorways,

26:12.819 --> 26:14.120
tunnels.

26:18.692 --> 26:21.794
And judging by the
direction of that breeze,

26:24.731 --> 26:27.266
I would say...

26:27.334 --> 26:31.871
a passageway most likely
lies behind this wall.

26:45.120 --> 26:50.357
I have agreed to Lorenzo's
cunning plan of a marriage,

26:50.425 --> 26:53.193
only because
it will never happen.

26:53.261 --> 26:57.798
Accepting it obliges the Medicis
to join us here on Holy Saturday.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.306
Do we kill Lorenzo
coming up the path

26:59.333 --> 27:01.235
<i>or have my men</i>
<i>attack along his journey?</i>

27:01.302 --> 27:05.573
Count Riario commands that we strike
only when the brothers are together.

27:05.641 --> 27:10.579
Lorenzo and Giuliano enjoy
separate but equal sway

27:10.647 --> 27:13.315
over the loyalties
of the people.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.051
If they are not killed
simultaneously,

27:16.119 --> 27:18.620
then the survivor
will reclaim power.

27:18.688 --> 27:22.291
Eliminate both brothers at once
and we cripple their line.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.695
And as soon as
they're dead,

27:25.762 --> 27:31.334
Nazzareno Dragonetti, with
his Officers of the Night,

27:31.401 --> 27:33.869
- steps in.
- Can we be so sure?

27:33.937 --> 27:37.206
This is the man who spent years
doing the Medicis' bidding.

27:37.274 --> 27:38.907
<i>I must agree.</i>

27:38.975 --> 27:43.345
What assurances do we have that
your loyalty lies with our purpose?

27:43.413 --> 27:45.013
My allegiance
is to my family.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.250
And to Florence,
my home.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.485
And what of
Lorenzo's wife?

27:49.553 --> 27:51.453
My sister, Clarice.

27:51.521 --> 27:55.190
As the Bible says,

27:55.258 --> 27:59.461
a woman leaves her home
when she weds.

28:00.730 --> 28:03.265
She's no longer
truly your sister.

28:03.332 --> 28:05.500
However,

28:05.568 --> 28:11.707
you will be handsomely rewarded
for the loss you endure,

28:11.775 --> 28:14.877
<i>as you finally return</i>
<i>to Rome where you belong,</i>

28:14.945 --> 28:18.014
Vice Chancellor
to the Holy Father.

28:19.883 --> 28:22.285
As each of you
will be rewarded.

28:22.353 --> 28:25.989
Isn't this what we
complain of in Lorenzo?

28:26.057 --> 28:28.025
That he is not a leader
of a republic

28:28.093 --> 28:32.029
but a tyrant dividing his
spoils among his cronies?

28:32.097 --> 28:35.365
Are we just exchanging one family
of nepotistic leaders for another?

28:35.433 --> 28:36.633
Basta!

28:41.606 --> 28:44.675
Take a drink, brother,
and calm down.

28:44.742 --> 28:47.444
Like any new leaders,
we...

28:47.512 --> 28:51.815
we promote
those loyal to us.

28:51.883 --> 28:55.352
<i>But Lorenzo is a weak,</i>
<i>bankrupt traitor</i>

28:55.419 --> 28:57.888
<i>hiding behind</i>
<i>political privilege.</i>

28:57.955 --> 28:59.990
How is Florence
a world power

29:00.057 --> 29:03.793
if Europe knows our
republic is in such hands?

29:03.861 --> 29:07.030
The Pazzi name offers legitimacy
and security

29:07.097 --> 29:08.831
with trade partners
and neighboring armies.

29:14.037 --> 29:17.106
The time to question
your allegiance is...

29:19.075 --> 29:23.245
..well, it's long past.

29:48.735 --> 29:51.269
That is how the Medicis
will die.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.274
Quickly.

29:58.977 --> 30:04.582
Stand with us or...
not at all.

30:25.303 --> 30:26.837
Viccolo della Manna.

30:26.904 --> 30:29.406
The home of Lucrezia's aunt,
Anna Donati.

30:32.910 --> 30:35.479
Signora,
are you Anna Donati?

30:36.514 --> 30:40.083
We require your niece,
Lucrezia.

30:40.151 --> 30:41.284
Has she not returned home?

30:41.352 --> 30:44.454
She was here, but she left
for Florence days ago.

30:44.522 --> 30:47.157
You understand
we'll need to look around.

30:59.136 --> 31:00.603
Did she take the road to
Poggibonsi

31:00.671 --> 31:02.138
or through Chianti?

31:02.206 --> 31:04.474
Poggibonsi, of course.
It's safer.

31:08.112 --> 31:12.349
If you hear from her, send word
to me immediately in Florence.

31:12.416 --> 31:13.750
Of course.

31:36.773 --> 31:37.940
Behold.

31:42.145 --> 31:43.912
If it is treasure
you seek,

31:43.980 --> 31:46.481
this chamber contains more
that you should ever require.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.391
<i>It appears we awe</i>
<i>even Da Vinci.</i>

31:56.459 --> 32:00.729
I'm just astonished...

32:00.797 --> 32:03.832
..at what tyranny can steal.

32:05.368 --> 32:10.906
Blood was the ransom paid
for these artifacts.

32:10.974 --> 32:14.576
Hypocrisy from a man
who threatens my life.

32:14.643 --> 32:18.445
Voiced by one
who attempted to take mine.

32:18.513 --> 32:22.182
Whose agent authored
this denunciation...

32:23.351 --> 32:26.252
..to have me burned.

32:29.723 --> 32:32.325
But this is in
a woman's hand.

32:32.393 --> 32:37.763
Could you truly believe I would
employ a daughter of Eve as an agent?

32:39.366 --> 32:40.833
I seek a key.

32:40.901 --> 32:44.870
The second needed
to open the Vault of Heaven.

32:44.938 --> 32:46.805
For this
you would risk death?

32:46.873 --> 32:52.377
Do not continue...
with this ruse.

32:52.445 --> 32:55.047
You aim only to delay me

32:55.114 --> 32:57.849
until your absence
is noticed by your guards.

32:57.917 --> 33:01.753
Your mind is restless.

33:01.821 --> 33:06.091
Yearning for that which
most cannot comprehend.

33:06.159 --> 33:10.563
God can end your longing.

33:10.631 --> 33:13.967
For He presents you
the chance to explore

33:14.034 --> 33:15.869
all the mysteries
of this chamber.

33:15.936 --> 33:21.674
If you would only agree to
replace Cardinal Mercuri.

33:21.742 --> 33:26.113
You would entice me to become
keeper of the Secret Archives?

33:26.181 --> 33:28.749
Not keeper. Oh, no, no, no.

33:28.817 --> 33:31.051
Its explorer.

33:36.190 --> 33:37.491
<i>Come with me, Da Vinci.</i>

33:42.063 --> 33:43.097
Come with me...

33:43.164 --> 33:47.401
and then tell me
you're not intrigued.

34:05.620 --> 34:07.421
So, what now, Signor?

34:07.488 --> 34:10.757
If she has nothing to hide, she'll
take the road through Poggibonsi.

34:10.824 --> 34:13.025
But if she conspires
against us,

34:13.094 --> 34:15.428
she'd find a way to ride
alone through Chianti.

34:15.496 --> 34:17.563
- Which road do we take?
- We prepare for the worst

34:17.630 --> 34:19.899
and find ourselves relieved
if we were wrong.

34:19.967 --> 34:21.668
Through Chianti.

34:25.139 --> 34:28.908
- Cara mia, who were they?
- That was Lorenzo's brother.

34:28.976 --> 34:30.110
Perhaps I've been
away too long.

34:30.177 --> 34:33.012
Or perhaps your own business
in Rome has gone bad.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.281
I'd hoped to spare you
knowledge of these matters.

34:35.349 --> 34:38.184
Can no-one in Florence
help you? What about Lorenzo?

34:38.251 --> 34:41.387
He sentenced a man he's loved
for decades to death,

34:41.455 --> 34:43.422
on suspicion of something
I have done.

34:43.489 --> 34:45.324
Well, is there no-one else?

34:51.766 --> 34:54.168
Yes.

34:54.235 --> 34:56.770
<i>There is another.</i>

34:56.838 --> 35:01.542
<i>A man who could invent</i>
<i>an escape where none exists.</i>

35:06.047 --> 35:07.581
<i>The skull of a dragon.</i>

35:07.649 --> 35:10.050
<i>It would serve as a unique</i>
<i>addition to your study</i>

35:10.118 --> 35:14.621
<i>of creatures</i>
<i>and their anatomy, yes?</i>

35:30.907 --> 35:34.342
Perhaps you'd care
to examine this.

35:36.779 --> 35:38.613
The Spear of Destiny.

35:40.783 --> 35:44.052
A lance used
to pierce the side of Christ

35:44.120 --> 35:46.388
while He hung on the cross.

35:49.258 --> 35:52.094
Many believe
that in one's hands...

35:52.161 --> 35:53.929
..it can defeat any enemy.

36:09.679 --> 36:10.746
It's extraordinary.

36:12.749 --> 36:14.150
But what of the key?

36:14.218 --> 36:17.287
This obsession
with the Book Of Leaves.

36:17.355 --> 36:22.459
The Turk blinds you
with tricks and deceptions.

36:22.527 --> 36:26.097
<i>The Sons of Mithras</i>
<i>are an extinct order.</i>

36:26.164 --> 36:27.799
<i>Those who advance</i>
<i>its name now,</i>

36:27.866 --> 36:29.667
<i>conceal their real agenda.</i>

36:29.735 --> 36:34.005
In your quest, you unknowingly act
as an agent for the Ottoman Sultan.

36:34.073 --> 36:37.876
My quest is not in pursuit
of anyone's purpose...

36:37.944 --> 36:39.912
except my own.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.447
Ah.

36:42.515 --> 36:45.117
And here, you speak
of your mother, I presume.

36:47.855 --> 36:50.123
A treasure truly worth
fighting for.

36:50.191 --> 36:54.661
And one only I can aid
in reuniting you with.

36:54.729 --> 36:56.830
What do you know
of my mother?

36:58.299 --> 36:59.532
Holy Father?

37:01.936 --> 37:04.137
Holy Father!

37:13.913 --> 37:16.415
An enemy has entered
the Vatican.

37:17.717 --> 37:20.985
Montefeltro,
sound the alarm.

37:22.021 --> 37:25.089
Pledge your allegiance
to Rome

37:25.157 --> 37:28.425
and you shall have the entire resources
of the Catholic Church at your disposal.

37:28.493 --> 37:30.260
Its coffers, devisings,

37:30.328 --> 37:32.696
even the ships of the Papal
Armada to ferry you.

37:32.764 --> 37:35.832
And the Book Of Leaves? What if I
should uncover that on my search?

37:35.900 --> 37:38.168
So much the better.

37:38.235 --> 37:41.471
It's far too precious
to be left unguarded.

37:41.539 --> 37:45.007
There was a time when I
distrusted its very existence.

37:45.075 --> 37:48.078
Until my eyes
fell upon this.

37:50.481 --> 37:53.517
Which we recovered
from Florence.

37:53.585 --> 37:55.252
Oh!

38:04.896 --> 38:06.964
It's unlike any language
I've ever encountered.

38:07.031 --> 38:09.166
That is far
from its only mystery.

38:17.876 --> 38:20.511
The words...

38:20.579 --> 38:23.581
they seem to...
change with every viewing?

38:23.649 --> 38:25.584
Never offering
the same content twice.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.485
Imagine solving this.

38:29.789 --> 38:33.258
I had a dream
not long after I saw this.

38:33.326 --> 38:35.794
A powerful message
sent from the heavens.

38:35.862 --> 38:37.997
It told me the Book Of Leaves

38:38.064 --> 38:42.334
contains...
secrets of the divine.

38:42.402 --> 38:44.703
That its authors
were the Nephilim -

38:44.771 --> 38:48.274
the offspring of Angels
and the women of man.

38:48.341 --> 38:49.942
<i>Father!</i>

38:50.009 --> 38:53.412
<i>I know now that the Book</i>
<i>with its mysteries</i>

38:53.480 --> 38:55.614
<i>must remain within</i>
<i>the Church.</i>

38:55.682 --> 38:56.520
No matter the cost.

38:56.545 --> 38:59.405
Is it defense or burial
that you intend as its fate?

38:59.553 --> 39:01.587
The world needs secrets.

39:01.655 --> 39:05.792
<i>Powerful ideas can wreak</i>
<i>havoc if unleashed before their time.</i>

39:05.859 --> 39:10.564
But a new beginning can start
with you here now, if you choose.

39:10.631 --> 39:13.400
Hold, Montefeltro.

39:13.467 --> 39:16.970
So...we are allied.

39:17.038 --> 39:19.540
You press for my devotion

39:19.608 --> 39:22.543
as only to place me here

39:22.611 --> 39:26.413
as another relic in this tomb
that you've constructed.

39:26.481 --> 39:28.148
Take him.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.889
Come on!

39:35.957 --> 39:37.457
Get him!

39:43.196 --> 39:45.798
Go!

39:47.133 --> 39:50.469
Nico! Come back here,
you spongy pignut.

39:50.536 --> 39:52.170
Your master returns.

39:53.072 --> 39:54.505
Nico!

39:55.073 --> 39:58.076
Leo.

40:01.847 --> 40:05.317
You are completely mad.

40:05.385 --> 40:06.952
Oh, fuck.

40:10.057 --> 40:12.324
I can't believe you stuck it
to that fuck Riario.

40:14.227 --> 40:16.295
I wish I could see his face
when he figures it out.

40:19.933 --> 40:21.734
Wishes come true.

40:21.802 --> 40:24.203
Through here.

40:36.249 --> 40:38.216
Where is Da Vinci?

40:39.285 --> 40:41.052
I'm the last person he tells.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.620
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:42.688 --> 40:45.690
Then...then perhaps
I'll entertain myself

40:45.758 --> 40:47.225
while I wait.

40:47.293 --> 40:49.193
The Vatican choir could use
a new castrato.

40:58.838 --> 41:00.005
Fuck.

41:06.779 --> 41:08.981
Move away.

41:17.924 --> 41:20.993
Yeaargh!

41:21.061 --> 41:22.595
Aaargh!

41:33.240 --> 41:35.141
Oh.

41:49.689 --> 42:02.934
Aaargh!

42:03.002 --> 42:04.202
God! Fuck! Aargh.

42:18.350 --> 42:20.752
Do you know who I am?

42:21.654 --> 42:23.321
Young Nico.

42:25.157 --> 42:29.961
I...I see our first encounter
left your hand shaking.

42:30.029 --> 42:31.629
I'll steady it in your heart.

42:31.697 --> 42:34.999
Will you?
If revenge is your aim,

42:35.067 --> 42:39.002
you must overcome
your apprehension.

42:49.213 --> 42:54.216
Now that we've established
my propensity for directness,

42:54.284 --> 42:57.419
I have a question for you.

42:57.487 --> 43:00.155
Where is my Maestro?

43:00.222 --> 43:04.559
Have you ever tasted blood,
Nico?

43:04.627 --> 43:09.097
It erm...possesses
a peculiar saltiness.

43:09.164 --> 43:12.267
<i>Don't bother, Nico.</i>
<i>He doesn't know.</i>

43:12.335 --> 43:14.670
Wouldn't reveal anything
even if he did.

43:14.738 --> 43:17.306
- Yes, he will.
- You're quite right, Nico.

43:17.373 --> 43:21.244
I will tell you all about
the dozen Swiss mercenaries

43:21.311 --> 43:22.779
I dispatched to the Tiber

43:22.846 --> 43:24.547
who search for me
as we speak.

43:24.615 --> 43:26.616
I'll reveal my plan
when they arrive,

43:26.684 --> 43:32.555
to have them peel away your
skin one layer at a time.

43:32.622 --> 43:33.923
Like this?

43:33.991 --> 43:35.458
Aaargh!

43:39.630 --> 43:41.498
You don't want
to travel this road.

43:41.566 --> 43:44.802
If you wish to see him bleed, let
it be my doing. Come on, stop it.

43:44.869 --> 43:50.008
No! He's mine to face. And
he will answer my question.

43:50.075 --> 43:52.010
Where is he?

43:52.078 --> 43:54.913
I commend you
on your resolve, boy.

43:55.948 --> 43:57.982
In another life,
in other circumstances,

43:58.050 --> 44:01.018
I could have used
someone like you.

44:02.254 --> 44:04.288
Aaaarh!

44:14.633 --> 44:16.067
It's the second key.

44:39.058 --> 44:40.659
Aargh!

45:12.859 --> 45:15.328
Okay...

45:37.453 --> 45:39.086
That's a curious tune.

45:41.323 --> 45:46.060
May I ask...
where you know it from?

45:46.128 --> 45:49.831
It's of my own
construction.

45:49.898 --> 45:53.534
I've heard
the lullaby before.

45:57.072 --> 46:00.674
You are
Lucrezia Donati's father.

46:02.377 --> 46:03.978
Aren't you?

46:04.045 --> 46:08.683
Indeed...
Signor Da Vinci.

46:10.252 --> 46:12.420
Have we met before?

46:12.488 --> 46:18.426
No, but who else
so bedevils Riario?

46:19.595 --> 46:23.598
This ring belongs to you,
doesn't it?

46:26.035 --> 46:30.973
Once upon a time.
It was taken.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.742
May I ask
how you acquired it?

46:33.810 --> 46:38.080
It was a gift...
from your daughter.

46:38.148 --> 46:40.550
No, it is far more
than a gift.

46:43.420 --> 46:45.889
Do you love my daughter?

46:45.956 --> 46:48.959
Do you love my Lucrezia,
Leonardo?

46:49.027 --> 46:50.661
Ha.

46:56.368 --> 46:58.970
I must confess...

46:59.038 --> 47:04.175
I'm not sure who
your daughter is, Signor.

47:07.480 --> 47:11.382
Her image has always been...
shaded to me.

47:11.450 --> 47:14.218
Perhaps now I know why.

47:14.286 --> 47:18.055
You...

47:18.123 --> 47:19.323
You...

47:19.390 --> 47:22.325
You present...

47:22.393 --> 47:27.063
..a key piece in
unlocking her puzzle.

47:27.131 --> 47:30.300
She offers me your ring,

47:30.368 --> 47:32.102
but keeps your imprison...

47:32.170 --> 47:36.006
She keeps your imprisonment
a secret.

47:40.177 --> 47:41.444
She...

47:44.481 --> 47:47.283
..extends me her love...

47:47.350 --> 47:50.786
..but she continues
with Lorenzo.

47:50.853 --> 47:55.891
She despises Riario...
but she's barely met him.

47:59.929 --> 48:03.399
She hopes...to save you.

48:05.168 --> 48:06.268
To protect...

48:20.250 --> 48:21.818
<i>This is in a woman's hand.</i>

48:21.886 --> 48:23.653
How can you be so blind?

48:23.721 --> 48:26.222
She maneuvers for Rome.

48:29.026 --> 48:31.494
She feeds my secrets
to Riario.

48:31.562 --> 48:36.332
She...she poisons
her fellow citizens.

48:36.400 --> 48:40.702
She sees me imprisoned
and left to burn.

48:40.770 --> 48:42.604
And it's all to set you free.

48:42.672 --> 48:47.375
<i>Lucrezia acts at the behest</i>
<i>of other' cruel manipulations.</i>

48:47.443 --> 48:51.913
She loves me.
Blame that on me if you will.

48:52.848 --> 48:54.948
Not her.

48:58.786 --> 49:00.020
Harder!

49:01.222 --> 49:04.424
Remove yourself
from the shadows.

49:04.492 --> 49:08.061
Let us face your daughter
together.

49:08.128 --> 49:12.731
Lucrezia labors to secure
your freedom - why stay?

49:12.799 --> 49:15.134
I'm exactly
where I need to be.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.436
I don't understand.

49:17.504 --> 49:19.472
Go now, Leonardo.

49:19.539 --> 49:21.507
Return to my daughter.

49:21.575 --> 49:23.743
Tell her of my love.

49:23.810 --> 49:25.344
And your own.

49:43.664 --> 49:45.398
Don't brood,
Nico. He's fine.

49:47.601 --> 49:50.103
What you did earlier,

49:50.171 --> 49:53.472
coming to my aid,
was very brave.

49:53.540 --> 49:56.609
So...thank you.

49:59.213 --> 50:01.815
Then I should thank you
as well.

50:05.386 --> 50:08.354
Maestro! You had us worried.

50:08.422 --> 50:09.756
Nico, at least.

50:09.823 --> 50:12.024
I'm just glad
to leave this hellhole.

50:12.092 --> 50:16.362
I'm afraid...I'm afraid...

50:16.429 --> 50:19.264
I'm afraid I can't.

50:19.332 --> 50:23.669
I've failed to retrieve the key
and I'll stay until I acquire it.

50:23.736 --> 50:26.671
- Leo.
- What?

50:26.739 --> 50:29.107
Steel yourself
for a surprise.

50:34.479 --> 50:35.879
How?

50:35.947 --> 50:38.315
Credit this malt-worm.

50:38.383 --> 50:41.451
I wanted to gut the prick,
but he'd not have it.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.094
Huh.

50:58.632 --> 51:02.768
Artista...I see you escaped.

51:02.835 --> 51:05.637
And I see a key...

51:07.639 --> 51:09.373
..that you will
be giving to me.

51:09.441 --> 51:11.942
You best kill me first.

51:20.585 --> 51:25.823
I will follow you to the ends of
the earth to retrieve what's mine.

51:30.228 --> 51:33.096
There may come a day...

51:33.164 --> 51:38.368
..where I am forced to
take your life, Girolamo.

51:38.436 --> 51:40.871
It's not today.

51:40.939 --> 51:45.109
I've come into your home...

51:45.177 --> 51:48.613
..and I've taken the thing
that you hold dearest.

51:50.616 --> 51:53.218
I erm...

51:53.286 --> 51:56.621
I plan to return
the favor soon...

51:56.689 --> 52:01.525
..and take the one
most dearest to you.

52:05.698 --> 52:06.664
Maestro,
shall we just leave him?

52:08.433 --> 52:12.703
To be haunted
by your mistakes, Nico...

52:12.771 --> 52:16.774
..that's a fate
far worse than death.

52:45.906 --> 52:48.341
Don't touch her.
She's unclean.

52:52.446 --> 52:55.382
Weren't we told
she'd be in disguise?

52:56.884 --> 53:00.687
We can't pass her by.
We're stopping her.

53:00.755 --> 53:02.522
Halt!

53:02.590 --> 53:05.659
Halt. Halt!

53:05.726 --> 53:08.095
Halt!

53:08.163 --> 53:09.563
Stay where you are.

53:09.631 --> 53:11.098
Immunda!

53:11.166 --> 53:14.534
- Unveil yourself!
- I'm hideous.

53:14.602 --> 53:17.504
It's a woman. Riario said she'd
be disguised as a leper.

53:17.571 --> 53:19.606
Show your face
or we do it for you.

53:19.674 --> 53:23.209
Take off the mask.

53:23.277 --> 53:27.180
Look who has all her fingers.

53:27.248 --> 53:29.682
No!

53:29.750 --> 53:31.651
You're no leper, Signora.

53:34.322 --> 53:38.792
Stand down! I've been given
orders by Count Riario of Rome

53:38.860 --> 53:40.928
to bring information
for Lorenzo de Medici.

53:40.996 --> 53:43.598
Signora, you seem to be
a sunrise behind.

53:43.666 --> 53:45.667
We're on our own orders
from Rome.

53:45.734 --> 53:48.269
Lorenzo and his dolt of a
brother are to be assassinated.

53:48.337 --> 53:52.307
Your services are ended.
As is your life.

53:52.375 --> 53:54.576
I've never killed anyone
quite so pretty.

53:54.644 --> 53:56.745
This will be different.

53:56.812 --> 54:00.749
He said to make it look like brigands.
Don't do one clean hit.

54:00.817 --> 54:02.717
No.

54:04.287 --> 54:06.455
That's for fighting us.

54:08.725 --> 54:10.860
No!

54:10.927 --> 54:16.232
But first, let's give her
something to remember.

54:18.535 --> 54:21.970
Halt! Stand down!

54:22.038 --> 54:23.038
This doesn't concern you.
Ride on.

54:23.105 --> 54:25.106
I am Giuliano de Medici,

54:25.174 --> 54:28.409
brother to His Magnificence,
Lorenzo of Florence.

54:28.477 --> 54:30.045
I order you to stop!

54:30.112 --> 54:31.580
Romans have no authority
here.

54:31.647 --> 54:32.781
They will soon enough.

54:32.849 --> 54:36.584
And they want this deceptive
little tart dead.

54:40.289 --> 54:41.723
How has she offended Rome?

54:41.791 --> 54:45.427
She spied for Count Riario
and now he's done with her.

54:45.494 --> 54:48.564
What use is a slattern like this with the
Pazzis about to seize control of Florence?

54:48.632 --> 54:50.701
Aaargh!

54:51.302 --> 54:53.337
Signor!

55:13.091 --> 55:14.692
Aaargh!

55:14.759 --> 55:16.160
Bertino!

55:25.336 --> 55:27.570
Aaargh!

55:32.643 --> 55:35.311
<i>All this for a spy like you!</i>

55:35.378 --> 55:40.081
Bertino was a good man.
But so was Becchi.

55:40.149 --> 55:42.851
Goodness means
nothing to you.

55:42.918 --> 55:46.821
The hand that brought him the
hemlock was yours, wasn't it?

55:48.123 --> 55:53.560
What possesses you to betray
Lorenzo? To betray us all?

55:55.229 --> 55:56.496
You would never understand.

55:56.564 --> 55:58.565
Aaargh!

55:58.633 --> 56:03.203
You are the cunt
of an overworked whore.

56:03.271 --> 56:05.105
As my brother fucked you
in the ass,

56:05.173 --> 56:09.576
did you smile, knowing you
were doing the same to him?

56:09.644 --> 56:12.446
Let's return to him and see
how he feels about all this.

56:12.514 --> 56:15.349
Will he opt
to break you on the wheel

56:15.416 --> 56:18.285
in the public square, for the
edification of the masses?

56:18.352 --> 56:20.421
Or will his shame lead him
to kill you privately?

56:20.488 --> 56:24.758
Slowly, over weeks of time.

56:24.826 --> 56:27.561
Urgh! Oh!

56:36.236 --> 56:37.736
Aargh! Aargh!
