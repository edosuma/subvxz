01:05.282 --> 01:07.545
- Why are you smiling?

01:07.632 --> 01:10.113
- Because it's the most
wonderful time of the year.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.638
The smell of fresh pine,
cocoa, cinnamon.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.205
You are so lucky.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.338
I mean, I can't wait
to have all of this.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.513
- Wait, kids?

01:21.951 --> 01:23.518
You can have 'em.

01:23.605 --> 01:24.910
- I should probably find
my Prince Charming first.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.782
- Please, just take my kids.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.654
- Mom!
- Behave.
I will leave you with Santa.

01:29.741 --> 01:33.136
- Yay!

01:33.223 --> 01:34.920
- Oh, how was the speed-dating
event I set you up on?

01:35.007 --> 01:36.183
Any keepers?
- It was...

01:36.270 --> 01:37.358
- Juicy?

01:37.445 --> 01:38.620
- Uh...
- It was scandalous?

01:38.707 --> 01:40.535
- Non-existent.
- What?

01:40.622 --> 01:42.014
- Next.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.539
-
Holly, you are in your prime.

01:44.626 --> 01:47.194
You should have a line of guys
waiting to take you out.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.414
Can you put the phone down?

01:50.501 --> 01:52.199
- I'm following up
- with the Bell/
- Boyer account.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.504
Their marketing team
wants to do that shoot

01:53.591 --> 01:55.289
before Christmas.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.421
- Okay, fine, but once
you nail down the shoot,

01:57.508 --> 01:58.814
can you put it away?

01:58.901 --> 02:01.077
- Yes.
- Gotta keep perspective, babe.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.732
We run an ad agency,
not air traffic control.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.344
Look, Holly, I love you, I do,

02:07.431 --> 02:10.913
but this whole workaholic
thing, it's not healthy.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.915
When's the last time
you a trimmed a tree?

02:13.002 --> 02:16.005
Isn't this supposed to be
the most wonderful time
of the year?

02:16.092 --> 02:17.659
- Does the one on my desk count?

02:18.703 --> 02:20.923
- <i>Courtney,
please come to office 105.</i>

02:21.010 --> 02:22.794
<i>We have another paper jam.</i>

02:22.881 --> 02:24.492
- Holly.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.015
- Look, there will be plenty
of time for tree-trimming

02:26.102 --> 02:28.278
and all that other stuff later.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.237
- Life does not start later.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.717
The holidays do not start later.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.241
Here, take my card.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.025
I want you to go
to the tree farm,

02:36.112 --> 02:38.419
and I want you to buy the most
beautiful one you can find.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.464
- But--
- No buts.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.510
Consider this a direct
order from your boss.

02:42.597 --> 02:43.946
And I will be checking
the charges

02:44.033 --> 02:45.339
to make sure you follow through.

02:45.426 --> 02:47.558
- Fine, I will go buy a tree.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.038
- Now, if we can
find you somebody

02:49.125 --> 02:51.606
to share this beautifully
trimmed tree with...

02:51.693 --> 02:53.129
- Yeah,

02:53.216 --> 02:55.653
I think all the guys
in this line are taken.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.786
- Everyone gets a wish
on Christmas.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.269
- I guess there's hope yet.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.705
- What do you mean?

03:03.792 --> 03:05.794
- Well, I could always use
my Christmas wish

03:05.881 --> 03:07.796
to find my happily ever after.

03:07.883 --> 03:08.971
- Well, better late than never.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.712
- Okay, all right.

03:10.799 --> 03:13.062
My Christmas wish
is to meet Mr. Right.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.672
-
- Stop beating up your sister.

03:14.759 --> 03:17.066
I will ground you for life.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.068
I'm sorry.
What was that last part?

03:19.155 --> 03:22.680
- I said, my Christmas wish
is to meet Mr. Right.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.247
- Hey, she got two wishes.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.422
- No,
she didn't mean it, sweetie.

03:25.509 --> 03:26.945
She's just very lonely.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.251
- Next.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.255
- All right, slow down.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.126
- Merry Christmas
-

05:43.734 --> 05:44.996
- Hmm.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.781
Nope.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
That's a little bit too big.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.528
Hm. Nope.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.446
Oh, you're cute.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.538
Hmm.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.152
Come here.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.384
Help.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.345
- Miss, are you okay?

06:29.432 --> 06:31.391
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I don't know what happened.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.524
- I do. I think that tree
fell over on you.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.831
Let me help you up.
I'm Tom Wright.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.877
- Oh.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.531
Mr. Wright?

06:41.618 --> 06:43.707
- Oh, please,
you can just call me Tom.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.146
So can I help you find a tree?

06:48.233 --> 06:50.279
- Actually,
I think the tree picked me.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.586
- Well, you can't go wrong
with a classic noble fir,

06:52.673 --> 06:56.590
but would you consider maybe
a Colorado blue spruce?

06:56.677 --> 06:58.592
They are super
on trend this year.

06:58.679 --> 07:01.246
- I think I'm gonna go
with the noble fir.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.337
You sure know a lot about trees.
Do you work here?

07:05.425 --> 07:08.819
- No. No, I don't work here,
but I love Christmas.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.213
And I'm actually here picking
out a tree for myself.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.607
- Can I help you with that?
- Nah, I got it, pal.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.130
- Okay.

07:15.217 --> 07:19.395
- So, um, I guess that's it.
Noble fir it is.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.918
- That's the one.

07:21.005 --> 07:21.963
- Let me help you with that.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.094
- All right.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.665
- Come on, let's go.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.973
That should do it.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.540
Proper knot for a proper tree.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.414
You know, I never got your name.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.199
- Oh, I'm Holly.
Nice to meet you.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.854
- Well, nice meetin' you,
Holly.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.814
You're all set,
so happy holidays.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.337
- You too, and thank you.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.426
- Sure, don't mention it.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.471
Take care.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.082
- Wow.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.387
- You know, Holly.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.085
- Yeah?

07:58.869 --> 08:02.612
- Would you like to, um, um...

08:02.699 --> 08:04.962
get some dinner sometime?

08:05.049 --> 08:06.573
I mean, if I'm not overstepping.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.010
- I would love that.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.055
- Yeah?
- Give me your phone.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.580
- Okay, um.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.885
Here you go.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.983
Okay, well, I'm a walkin'
away for real this time.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.509
- Okay.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.902
- But I'll call you,
because I can now,

08:31.989 --> 08:34.514
and we can go get that dinner
sometime if you want to.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
- Really lookin' forward to it.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.996
- Okay. Bye now.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.520
Bye.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.257
- Help!

09:22.344 --> 09:23.737
Help, a little help here!

09:23.824 --> 09:25.521
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.266
I'm so sorry. Here, let me help.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.441
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.790
- I'm so sorry.

09:35.531 --> 09:36.619
Oh.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.273
- What happened?

09:38.360 --> 09:40.144
- I...
- It's okay. It's all right.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.972
I'm-- I'm all right. I'm fine.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.365
It's okay, really.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.193
Did you tie this thing up
onto your roof?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.412
- No, it was the guy
at the tree lot.

09:47.499 --> 09:49.980
I think he called it
a proper knot.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.155
- Proper knot?

09:51.242 --> 09:52.983
No, that doesn't even exist.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.072
Nah, this looks like a,
this looks like a slipknot.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.247
Should have done
like a timber hitch

09:56.334 --> 09:57.901
or maybe even a sheepshank,

09:57.988 --> 09:59.555
somethin' you can easily get
undone when you get home.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.818
I mean, what is this,
amateur hour here? I'm sorry.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.646
I don't mean to talk bad
about someone I haven't met.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.474
It's just, I mean, you really
could have hurt somebody.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.128
I'm sorry. What happened?

10:07.215 --> 10:08.695
Was he, like, havin' a bad day?

10:08.782 --> 10:10.653
Did he get distracted
or somethin'?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.265
Miss?

10:14.352 --> 10:16.311
- Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.009
- Absolutely what?

10:20.837 --> 10:22.622
- To what you just said.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.147
- Right, um.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.018
Why don't I get this up
on your roof for you.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.933
- You know what, I just
live down the block.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.675
It's probably easier at this
point if I just carry it.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.460
- Oh. Okay, uh.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.071
Do you need a hand?

10:38.594 --> 10:39.813
- Sure.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.641
- Okay. Austin, by the way.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.555
- Holly.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.079
- Nice to meet you, Holly.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.432
- Lot of sap.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.521
I'll do it.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.131
Okay.
- Okay.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.611
- Pull up.

10:55.698 --> 10:56.917
All right, just,
yeah, get the...

10:57.004 --> 10:58.179
Once the trunk
is through there...

10:58.266 --> 10:59.049
- Yep.
- I can get it from there.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.050
Okay.
- Okay.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.312
- We're almost there.

11:01.399 --> 11:02.444
Okay.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.753
Okay.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.189
All right, we got it.
- Okay.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.886
- All right, goin' in here.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.279
- Yeah, just...
- Right here, whew.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.889
- That way.
Almost in the hole.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.543
Wait, no, a little to the left.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.240
To the right, the right. Okay!

11:16.327 --> 11:18.112
Right, right there, drop it.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.548
Okay.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.161
Oh.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.209
I meant get
something a little smaller.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.561
- It's fine,
just needs a little trimming.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.041
- Yeah, trimming.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.305
How do I do that?

11:37.392 --> 11:38.698
- You got some shears?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.227
- Yeah.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.839
- Okay, um.

11:49.926 --> 11:53.016
I think we're
gonna need somethin'
a little bigger than this.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.714
Do you, uh,
you got lights and decorations

11:54.801 --> 11:56.063
and all that kind of stuff?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.547
I think we're gonna need
to make a little trip.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.724
- Well, I've got this covered.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.726
- Okay, let's go.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.641
-
- What are those for?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.773
- Uh, tree trimming.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.349
- So cool.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.135
Both, why not.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.484
I did.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.008
Hummingbird?

12:32.142 --> 12:34.710
- That means
you have to make cookies.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.364
-
Against the green tree.
-

12:36.451 --> 12:38.322
Uh.
- Oh!

12:38.409 --> 12:39.454
- Gotcha.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.371
Hi.

12:46.896 --> 12:47.897
- Okay, oof.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.310
- Oh, boy.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.139
- It's good.
It's good.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.358
We forgot to get hooks.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.795
- We?
- No.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.057
I forgot to get--
- You're the professional.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.450
- I forgot to get hooks, yeah.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.235
Nothin' to it.
- You and your knots.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.846
- I love knots. My grandfather
taught me every knot.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.630
Well, about 10 knots.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.328
There's a lot of, you
know, they're very useful.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.851
It's a very specific thing
with tinsel.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.505
See, you take like a
good loop of it, right?

13:30.592 --> 13:32.289
Like this, and then you go...

13:34.857 --> 13:35.815
See?

13:35.902 --> 13:36.903
See how much nicer that...

13:36.990 --> 13:39.166
Oh, come on.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.732
You should see
my grandma's tree.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.430
She goes way overboard
with the tinsel.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.649
It's like, is there a tree
to go with that tinsel, Grandma?

13:48.088 --> 13:50.307
- This is amazing.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.874
How'd you get so good at this?

13:54.268 --> 13:57.010
- It's part of my profession.
I'm an artist.

13:57.097 --> 14:00.752
- Hmm,
and that includes tree-trimming?

14:00.840 --> 14:03.364
- I work in mixed media,
sort of the same thing.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.979
What?

14:10.066 --> 14:12.677
- Nothing, it's just,
this was really fun,

14:12.764 --> 14:16.681
and you're a complete stranger.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.206
- Well,
I was a complete stranger
until your tree fell on me

14:19.293 --> 14:21.599
and almost killed me.
And then we decorated it.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.471
I think that makes us friends.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.216
I'm glad it did though.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.395
- Hey, do you want
somethin' to eat, or drink?

14:34.482 --> 14:35.962
- Oh, no, you don't have
to go through all that.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.051
- Are you kidding me?
It's the least I can do.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.791
I'll make you somethin'.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.185
- Okay.

14:43.578 --> 14:46.059
Not one to turn down food.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.321
- How about some pasta?

14:47.408 --> 14:49.149
- Yeah,
anything, I'm easy.

14:49.236 --> 14:52.152
- Or a sandwich?

14:52.239 --> 14:54.023
- Yeah. Yeah,
that all sounds great.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.767
- How about we order food?

15:00.508 --> 15:02.423
- That's fine. My treat.

15:06.949 --> 15:07.907
I'm stuffed.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.647
- Me too.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.258
I didn't realize
how hungry I was.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.260
- Yeah.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.652
So your dad was a fireman?

15:16.872 --> 15:18.047
- Yeah, he was.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.008
He was a really special guy.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.619
He died about four years
ago just before Christmas.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.625
- Yeah, that must've been
really hard on you and your mom.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.237
- Actually, my mom died
when I was 12.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.633
It was just me and my pop.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.811
- Oh, Holly, I'm so sorry.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.682
- Yeah.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.293
I think about him all the time.

15:48.817 --> 15:49.861
- Yeah.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.997
Yeah, my dad,
he died a few years ago.

16:00.611 --> 16:01.961
I miss him a lot.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.705
But, you know,
I have two brothers,

16:09.229 --> 16:11.231
my mom,

16:11.318 --> 16:12.536
and a crazy old grandma.

16:14.886 --> 16:18.238
They're nuts, but I mean,
whose family isn't, right?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.588
- You're lucky.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.808
- Yeah, I am. I know it.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.078
It's getting kind of late,
Ms. Holly.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.557
I think I should get goin'.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.256
- Yeah.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.262
- I'd like to see you again.

16:42.349 --> 16:45.047
- Well,
you know where to find me.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.835
- Well, um...

16:56.145 --> 16:57.581
Um.

17:04.588 --> 17:08.288
I'm not really, uh, up on
all the new dating customs.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.419
I'm trying to catch up.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.384
Here's my number.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.386
Call me, no pressure.

17:20.561 --> 17:21.562
- Okay.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.564
- Great.

17:23.651 --> 17:24.869
All right, I'm gonna go.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.742
Bye.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.577
- Hey, Austin, wait.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.057
Wait.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.672
Um, drive safe.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.326
Don't get hit by any trees.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.198
- I won't.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.982
Bye.
- Bye.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.862
- I forgot my jacket.

18:02.429 --> 18:03.734
Bye.
- Bye.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.012
- No, absolutely not.

19:04.099 --> 19:07.015
No, just get it done.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.191
Get it done.
Get it done. Get it done.

19:09.278 --> 19:12.760
Get it done!
Goodbye.

19:12.847 --> 19:13.804
- Everything, okay?

19:13.891 --> 19:16.242
- Here, sit.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.679
Photographer's running late,
and our first model has
a hard out in an hour, so.

19:18.766 --> 19:19.984
- I'm so sorry.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.030
- Sorry?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.858
Look, you've worked
for me for seven years,

19:23.945 --> 19:25.251
and you've never been late.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.948
You're like a machine.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.471
I know there must be a story.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.650
Okay, tell me there's a guy.

19:33.737 --> 19:37.045
- I met a guy.
- Oh, yes. I want details.

19:37.132 --> 19:40.831
- Well, I got a Christmas tree,
like you said.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.878
And then the tree fell off
my car, and it hit this guy,

19:43.965 --> 19:47.534
and he ended up carrying the
tree back to my place, and we,

19:47.621 --> 19:50.450
we decorated the tree
and ordered food.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.888
- Wait, are we talking like
fairy tale material here?

19:53.975 --> 19:55.324
Oh.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.412
True love's first kiss.

19:56.499 --> 19:57.848
- Slow down.

19:57.935 --> 20:01.112
- Oh, a gentleman,
I can get behind that.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.810
You gonna see him again?

20:02.897 --> 20:04.725
- I hope so. Yeah.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.988
He gave me his number,
and I texted him
right after he left.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.426
- Oh.

20:10.513 --> 20:11.688
- What? What was that?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.908
Why? Why, "Oh"?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.086
- Look, I've been out the game
for a couple years, I know.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.348
But aren't you supposed to wait
a while

20:19.435 --> 20:21.132
before you send the first text?

20:22.786 --> 20:26.094
- No. No, Austin's different.

20:26.181 --> 20:29.010
No, I am positive
I made the right move.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.406
I think.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.799
- All right. Well,
I mean, what did he reply?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.368
- Well, nothing yet.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.806
- All right, well...

20:42.893 --> 20:44.243
Oh, great, the photographer's
finally here.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.462
All right,
bring in the first model.

20:46.549 --> 20:47.681
Hi.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.295
- Nothing.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.253
I don't understand.
He ghosted me.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.733
- There's plenty of fish
in the sea.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.735
I mean, you're just
gettin' back out there.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.432
It's gonna take a couple tries
to find the right guy.

21:43.519 --> 21:46.043
- Yeah,
but I really liked Austin.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.828
- Girl, it was one date.

21:47.915 --> 21:51.222
- One random, spontaneous,
once-in-a-lifetime kind of date.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.399
- Okay.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.751
- Hello.
- <i>Holly?</i>

21:57.838 --> 21:59.622
- Austin?

21:59.709 --> 22:03.147
- <i>Holly? Can you hear me?
It's Tom from the tree lot.</i>

22:03.234 --> 22:05.889
- Oh, uh. Hi, Tom.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.500
How you doin'?

22:07.587 --> 22:09.458
<i>- Good. Really good,
thanks for askin'.</i>

22:09.545 --> 22:11.199
<i>Holly, I was wondering</i>

22:11.286 --> 22:13.462
<i>if I could maybe take you
to dinner this week?</i>

22:13.549 --> 22:15.464
- Uh, sure.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.597
<i>- Great.
What night are you free?</i>

22:17.684 --> 22:18.598
- Tonight!

22:18.685 --> 22:20.295
<i>- Oh, that's perfect.</i>

22:20.382 --> 22:21.514
<i>How about Del Sol in Midtown,
eight o'clock?</i>

22:21.601 --> 22:24.430
<i>I can pick you up.</i>

22:24.517 --> 22:26.214
- You know what, it's actually
on my way home from work,

22:26.301 --> 22:27.737
so I will just meet you there.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.086
<i>- Sounds good, see you then.</i>

22:29.173 --> 22:30.436
- Okay.

22:32.699 --> 22:35.658
- And who is Tom?

22:35.745 --> 22:38.226
- Actually, you get
credit for this one too.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.924
I met him at the tree
lot right before Austin.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.274
- Look at you, see,
I told you, reeling 'em in,

22:43.362 --> 22:44.667
plenty of fish.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.907
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.430
- You look beautiful.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.563
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Please.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.218
- So how's your tree?

23:14.305 --> 23:17.265
- The Colorado
spruce, it's doin' fantastic.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.267
- Good. How about work?

23:19.354 --> 23:21.008
What is it that you do, again?

23:21.095 --> 23:22.575
- I'm in finance, so, you know,

23:22.662 --> 23:24.577
the end of the year
is always crazy.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.013
I'm just tryin' to wrap
everything up
before the holidays.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.101
- I can relate.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.711
- Yeah? What about you?

23:28.798 --> 23:31.366
Have any big plans
for Christmas comin' up?

23:31.453 --> 23:34.064
- No. No, usually,
I've been so busy
the past few years

23:34.151 --> 23:36.023
I just work through
the holidays.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.416
- Work through the holidays?

23:37.503 --> 23:38.939
- Mm-hmm, I help
my boss out with her kids,

23:39.026 --> 23:40.941
but this year
they're going back east,

23:41.028 --> 23:43.422
so she's adamant that I unplug.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.815
It'll be nice
to have some alone time.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.426
- Do you have any siblings?

23:47.513 --> 23:49.123
- No, just me.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.820
My parents
are no longer with us,

23:50.907 --> 23:52.605
and I usually spend
Christmas with friends,

23:52.692 --> 23:55.912
but I always end up
feeling like a third wheel.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.088
Or like a 13th.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.786
-
Well, I'm sure your friends

23:59.873 --> 24:01.048
love having you around.

24:02.397 --> 24:03.616
Pinot?

24:03.703 --> 24:04.878
- Sure.
- All right.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.540
- Thank you.

24:14.627 --> 24:17.586
- To, uh, never being
the third wheel again.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.283
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.639
- Very good pick.
- Thanks.

24:26.726 --> 24:27.944
Here you go.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.380
- Thank you.
- You got it.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.034
- Have you been here before?

24:31.121 --> 24:32.340
- I have.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.733
Yeah.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.082
I recommend
basically everything.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.128
- Great.
- Yeah.

24:38.215 --> 24:39.782
- Dinner was great. Thank you.

24:39.869 --> 24:42.176
- Yeah, it's one of my
very favorite spots.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.786
The owner
is actually a friend.

24:46.136 --> 24:49.270
I'd, uh,
I'd like to do this again.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.577
Would that be possible?

24:51.664 --> 24:53.535
- Maybe.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.320
This is me.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.713
- I remember.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.367
Yeah, here.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.630
- Thank you.

25:01.717 --> 25:02.892
- Well.
- Well.

25:04.024 --> 25:04.938
- Goodnight.
- Goodbye.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.287
-
- Yeah.

25:25.654 --> 25:28.701
I didn't mean to startle you.
- It's okay.

25:28.788 --> 25:32.618
- Um, this might sound crazy,
but my family and I,

25:32.705 --> 25:33.793
we own a cabin in the mountains.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.751
We go there every Christmas.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.493
I know you said you didn't have
any plans for the holidays.

25:38.580 --> 25:42.497
So I was wondering if you
would maybe wanna come join us?

25:42.584 --> 25:44.543
Does that sound crazy?

25:44.630 --> 25:46.675
- No, it's incredibly sweet.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.764
But I couldn't impose like that.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.897
- It would be
no imposition at all.

25:50.984 --> 25:54.640
As my grandmother always says,
the more the merrier.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.384
Look, um, sleep on it.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.473
We leave the day after tomorrow.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.608
I would love it
if, uh, you would come join us.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.220
- Okay. I'll think about it.

26:10.307 --> 26:11.526
I'll let you know.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.093
- Okay.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.705
Well, goodnight, again.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.446
- Goodnight, Tom.
- Yeah. Okay.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.594
- See, I told you, you just
needed to open yourself up

26:35.681 --> 26:37.683
to the magic of the holidays.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.815
I don't know what to do.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.338
What do you mean?

26:41.425 --> 26:43.253
Look, last week your love
life was non-existent,

26:43.340 --> 26:44.951
and now we look at you.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.127
You're goin' on a ski trip
with a handsome bachelor.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.129
- I just met the guy.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.957
- Alright, fine,
be independent.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.262
Just meet him up there.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.090
You can stay
at our cabin!

26:54.177 --> 26:55.309
- Oh, Vicky, no.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.311
I can't do that.
- I insist.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.834
We're not makin' it
up there this year,

26:58.921 --> 27:01.141
and I refuse to let
that place go to waste.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.622
Oh, this is perfect.
You're going.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.971
- No, I don't know.

27:05.058 --> 27:07.277
-
This is exactly what you need,

27:07.364 --> 27:10.106
a fabulous holiday trip
with your new guy.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.805
- He's new,
but he's not my guy.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.328
I barely know him.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.199
- Girl, don't be a fool.

27:16.286 --> 27:18.898
Besides, meeting the family
will make the decision for you.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.465
You will know everything
you need to after you meet them.

27:22.597 --> 27:25.208
- It is a beautiful drive.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.775
- When's the last time
you've been in the mountains?

27:26.862 --> 27:28.168
- It's been awhile.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.387
- Ooh, come on, Holly.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.519
Call him, and tell him now.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.086
- I'm not gonna call him now.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.481
- I will be in Philly
with four honey badgers

27:37.568 --> 27:39.396
who are actively plotting
an all-nighter

27:39.483 --> 27:41.964
to catch a dear old St. Nick.

27:42.051 --> 27:45.228
Let me live through you
and the excitement of new love.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.622
- Fine. I will call him.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.281
- <i>Hello?</i>

27:54.368 --> 27:56.370
- Hey, Tom, it's Holly.
- <i>Holly!</i>

27:56.457 --> 27:57.719
- If the invitation
still stands,

27:57.806 --> 27:58.807
I would love
to spend the holidays

27:58.894 --> 27:59.982
with you and your family.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.202
- <i>That's great news.</i>

28:02.289 --> 28:03.638
- But I'll-- I'll meet you
up there,

28:03.725 --> 28:05.379
because I made
my own arrangements.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.336
- <i>Are you sure?
I don't mind driving you.</i>

28:06.423 --> 28:07.860
- Yeah, of course.

28:07.947 --> 28:08.817
I'll let you know
when I arrive in a few days.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.384
- <i>Sounds perfect.</i>

28:10.471 --> 28:12.168
<i>Well, let me know
when you get there.</i>

28:12.255 --> 28:14.344
<i>And, um, drive safe,
and I can't wait to see you.</i>

28:14.431 --> 28:15.998
- Okay, sounds good.
I'll see you soon.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.086
Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

28:19.436 --> 28:20.524
- You gotta pack.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.570
- I gotta pack.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.591
- Can I help you find something?

29:27.678 --> 29:29.332
- I would love that.

29:29.419 --> 29:30.812
I need to rent some skis
for the week,

29:30.899 --> 29:33.119
but, if I'm being honest,

29:33.206 --> 29:35.208
I have no idea
what I'm looking at.

29:35.295 --> 29:37.340
- Oh, well, you mind
if I ask you a few questions,

29:37.427 --> 29:39.168
see if we can narrow
things down a little bit?

29:39.255 --> 29:40.779
- Sure.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.693
- What type of skiing
do you usually like to do?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.218
- It's been a few years.

29:45.305 --> 29:48.482
- A few years
isn't too bad.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.223
- A decade.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.138
- Well, you're gettin'
back out there.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.793
So do you like to ski
the groomed runs,

29:54.880 --> 29:57.099
or are you looking
for a little more adventure

29:57.186 --> 29:58.971
out of bounds?

29:59.058 --> 30:00.494
- Usually a groomer girl,

30:00.581 --> 30:02.452
but I think it's time
to broaden my horizons

30:02.539 --> 30:03.976
while I still can.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.673
Not exactly
a spring chicken anymore.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.893
- Come on, you're
in the prime of your life.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.677
Time's on your side.

30:09.764 --> 30:13.028
But since it's been a few years,

30:13.115 --> 30:15.770
how about if I set you up
with these all-mountain skis?

30:15.857 --> 30:17.641
That way you can try
a little bit of everything,

30:17.728 --> 30:19.643
and you should be able
to find what you're looking for

30:19.730 --> 30:20.862
by the end of the week.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.821
- That's perfect.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.648
- So, anything else
I can help you with?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.607
- Ah, maybe some luck.
-

30:26.694 --> 30:28.174
I'm gonna need it.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.610
Or a guardian angel.

30:29.697 --> 30:32.874
- You're gonna do just fine,
young lady.

30:32.961 --> 30:35.181
The mountain has a way
of keeping us in the moment

30:35.268 --> 30:36.617
and helping us find things

30:36.704 --> 30:38.575
we didn't even know
we were lookin' for.

30:38.662 --> 30:42.188
I'll just take these in back
and get 'em set up for you.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.741
- <i>Holly, I hope
you enjoy this holiday.</i>

31:13.828 --> 31:15.656
<i>I had the neighbors
put up a few decorations.</i>

31:15.743 --> 31:18.311
<i>I hope it adds
to the Christmas spirit.</i>

31:18.398 --> 31:20.269
<i>Just use the smart tablet
to work the place.</i>

31:20.356 --> 31:22.532
<i>You'll figure it out.
Have fun, hun.</i>

31:22.619 --> 31:24.883
<i>Enjoy. That's an order.</i>

31:24.970 --> 31:26.232
<i>Love, Vicky.</i>

32:26.422 --> 32:28.511
- Hey, Vicky, it's me.
I know you're on the plane.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.470
Just wanted to let you know
that I got to the cabin okay.

32:30.557 --> 32:31.558
And it is...

32:32.689 --> 32:34.865
it's absolutely magical.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.346
And really, no one's ever
done something so wonderful

32:37.433 --> 32:39.435
for me before.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.784
I'm meeting Tom tomorrow,

32:40.871 --> 32:42.786
so I'll let you know
how that goes.

32:42.873 --> 32:45.572
And, uh, yeah. I love you.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.923
Thank you again, really.
It means a lot.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.404
Hope you have a safe flight,
and I'll talk to you later.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.535
Bye.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.702
Okay, Mr. Wright.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.574
Here we go.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.736
- Holly?

35:29.823 --> 35:30.867
- Austin?

35:31.738 --> 35:32.782
- Holly!

35:33.783 --> 35:35.698
- Tom?
- Tom?

35:35.785 --> 35:37.135
- Austin?
- Austin?

35:37.222 --> 35:38.266
- Holly?

35:38.353 --> 35:39.398
- Wait a minute.

35:41.878 --> 35:45.186
Do you two know each other?

35:45.273 --> 35:49.843
- How
do you two know each other?

36:02.508 --> 36:04.858
- So how in the world
did the three of you meet?

36:04.945 --> 36:06.555
- Well, it's not
the three of us, Grandma.

36:06.642 --> 36:09.471
It's the two of us
and a third wheel.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.472
I invited Holly here.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.431
Yeah, like a tricycle.

36:12.518 --> 36:15.869
You know, the triangle's
the strongest shape in nature.

36:15.956 --> 36:18.524
- Uh, Holly and I met
at a tree lot, actually.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.787
I helped them pick out
the perfect noble fir

36:20.874 --> 36:22.528
and even attached it
to her car for her.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.008
It was really kind of fate.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.402
- Wait, wait a minute.
That was you?

36:27.489 --> 36:28.882
- Hmm?

36:28.969 --> 36:30.231
- You almost killed me.

36:30.318 --> 36:31.754
- What are you talking about?

36:31.841 --> 36:34.017
- Who ties a projectile
to the roof

36:34.104 --> 36:35.236
of the vehicle with a slipknot.

36:35.323 --> 36:36.846
I mean, how dumb can you be?

36:36.933 --> 36:38.457
It was practically manslaughter.

36:38.544 --> 36:39.893
- We're really gonna start
with the name-calling?

36:39.980 --> 36:41.373
Besides, it couldn't
possibly be manslaughter,

36:41.460 --> 36:45.246
because unfortunately
no one died.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.944
Anyway, about a week
later, I called Holly,

36:48.031 --> 36:49.381
invited her to dinner.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.861
We met up,
talked for hours and hours.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.515
It was like we had known
each other our whole lives.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.387
- Give me a break.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.953
- All right, that's it.

36:57.040 --> 36:57.911
- You know what, I don't
wanna cause any problems.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.391
I think I should go.

36:59.478 --> 37:00.609
Thank you so much.
- No, no, no, no, please.

37:00.696 --> 37:01.697
I'm sorry.
- Yes, I'm sorry as well.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.046
- We're sorry.
- Exactly.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.091
Please stay.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.745
- Holly, sit down.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.791
You're my guest, too,
and I insist that you stay.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.925
<i>♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪</i>

37:14.971 --> 37:16.669
Austin, how did you meet Holly?

37:18.192 --> 37:19.846
- Well...
...Holly and I met

37:19.933 --> 37:23.980
when the tree that Tom attempted
to secure to Holly's roof,

37:24.067 --> 37:26.374
with the most juvenile knot
you could imagine,

37:26.461 --> 37:28.463
flew off and hit me.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.291
So I helped her back
to the apartment with the tree,

37:30.378 --> 37:31.814
and, you know, we decorated it

37:31.901 --> 37:34.121
and spent five hours together.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.253
It was nice.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.778
It was really nice.

37:38.865 --> 37:41.215
At least, that's what I thought.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.478
- Wait a minute.
You spent five hours together?

37:43.565 --> 37:44.740
- Oh boy.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.481
- Yeah, the tree
that you picked out

37:46.568 --> 37:48.178
didn't even fit
in her apartment.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.835
- I love it.

37:52.922 --> 37:55.447
Oh, it reminds me of back
when I was being pursued

37:55.534 --> 37:57.884
by Raymond, and others,

37:57.971 --> 38:01.975
before everyone got so entitled
and lazy about dating.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.977
- Were you gettin' into the
eggnog a little early, Grandma?

38:04.064 --> 38:05.979
- Oh, hush up, Seth.

38:06.066 --> 38:08.068
Your grandfather was wonderful,

38:08.155 --> 38:10.113
but he was hardly the only man

38:10.200 --> 38:12.855
who was seeking my attention
at the time.

38:12.942 --> 38:15.380
- All right, Grandma.

38:15.467 --> 38:19.209
- I'm talkin' about a good
old fashioned cockfight.

38:21.734 --> 38:22.952
- This has really gone
far enough.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.693
- I agree.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.435
- Holly and I will go out
on a date alone. That is that.

38:27.522 --> 38:28.828
- Why are you taking Holly out?

38:28.915 --> 38:30.743
- Because it makes more sense,
okay.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.353
We have a lot more in common,

38:32.440 --> 38:33.963
and look,
I don't wanna be harsh,

38:34.050 --> 38:36.705
but I'm in a little more
financially stable situation.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.751
- I started dating her first.
- You started dating her first?

38:38.838 --> 38:41.797
- Actually,
no one was dating me.

38:41.884 --> 38:46.324
- Boys, like I was saying,
I was dating a marvelous man

38:46.411 --> 38:48.369
when your grandfather
came along.

38:49.327 --> 38:53.287
Oh, Harry.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.376
- Grandpa's name was Raymond.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.335
- And I loved your grandfather,

38:57.422 --> 38:59.554
but I often wonder
what would've happened

38:59.641 --> 39:01.774
if Harry had stuck around.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.558
- Ah geez, Mother.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.517
- Harry was a musician,

39:05.604 --> 39:09.042
and he often had to leave
town for long periods of time.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.044
And in his absence,

39:11.131 --> 39:13.873
Raymond came along
and swept me off my feet.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.578
We didn't have this cowardly,
handheld,

39:23.665 --> 39:26.407
swipe-right, iBox thingy.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.279
You had a walk up to the person,
be bold,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.064
and take your best shot.

39:31.151 --> 39:34.676
- Okay, Mom, we get it.

39:34.763 --> 39:38.506
- Tomorrow, why don't you
take Holly skiing with you.

39:38.593 --> 39:42.292
Both take her on a date,
may the best man win.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.599
- I can speak for myself
on this one.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.819
I'm not gonna be anyone's
Christmas conquest.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.908
I think I should go.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.084
Thank you very much
for the, um...

39:52.738 --> 39:56.045
Yeah.

40:08.449 --> 40:09.363
- Well-
- So-

40:09.450 --> 40:10.756
- Well...

40:10.843 --> 40:12.105
- Austin, come here.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.802
I need your help with somethin'.

40:13.889 --> 40:15.369
- Oh.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.632
- I'll be right back.

40:17.719 --> 40:18.720
- Take your time.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.027
- Listen, Tom,

40:21.114 --> 40:22.376
I didn't know that--
- Hey, hey,

40:22.463 --> 40:23.551
I don't need any explanations,
okay?

40:23.638 --> 40:25.466
I think you're an amazing girl.

40:25.553 --> 40:26.772
I think we have something
really special,

40:26.859 --> 40:28.121
and I'm looking forward
to defining

40:28.208 --> 40:29.557
exactly what that
something special is.

40:29.644 --> 40:30.906
So I hope you consider
coming skiing

40:30.993 --> 40:32.560
with my family and I tomorrow.

40:32.647 --> 40:33.561
- Oh, Tom.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.128
- What?

40:35.215 --> 40:36.303
- Grandma wants to you.

40:38.305 --> 40:39.785
- Oh, really?

40:39.872 --> 40:42.788
- Tom,
come here a second.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.878
- Coming, Grandma.

40:45.965 --> 40:47.357
I'll be right back.

40:50.752 --> 40:54.756
- Look, um, you don't need
to come skiing with us tomorrow.

40:54.843 --> 40:58.586
I mean, things got pretty
strange, pretty quickly.

40:59.674 --> 41:02.808
- I mean, I want to.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.985
- Really? Are you sure?

41:06.072 --> 41:09.597
- Are you sure? Because
you're the one that ghosted me.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.294
- Ghost? What ghost?

41:12.557 --> 41:13.514
What do you mean?

41:15.081 --> 41:17.039
- You never texted me back.

41:17.126 --> 41:18.563
But now, all of a sudden,

41:18.650 --> 41:20.216
because of some weird
brotherly competition,

41:20.303 --> 41:22.001
you're suddenly
interested again?

41:22.088 --> 41:24.351
- No, no, no, not at all.

41:24.438 --> 41:27.180
Wait a minute. You texted me?

41:27.267 --> 41:30.183
- Yes, a couple times.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.316
More than a couple times.

41:33.403 --> 41:34.448
- Holly.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.625
- What?

41:37.712 --> 41:39.758
- You were texting my landline.

41:39.845 --> 41:42.543
I gave you my house number.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.458
- Your house number?

41:44.545 --> 41:45.851
- Yeah.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.724
- You gave me a-- a landline?

41:49.811 --> 41:53.075
- Yeah, I-- I said call me.
I even wrote it
on the-- the note.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.251
- Who has a landline anymore?

41:55.338 --> 41:57.515
- I work from home,
and it makes sense to me.

42:00.213 --> 42:02.432
- I'm-- I'm so relieved yet...

42:04.217 --> 42:06.001
super annoyed.

42:08.700 --> 42:13.008
So I guess
I will see you tomorrow.

42:13.095 --> 42:15.837
- Just don't call my landline!

42:15.924 --> 42:17.491
Because I'm here now.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.193
- See you tomorrow, Holly!

42:41.950 --> 42:43.343
All right.

42:43.430 --> 42:45.301
Cali, Seth, we'll meet you guys

42:45.388 --> 42:46.651
at the lodge at noon for lunch.

42:46.738 --> 42:49.044
- Later.
- Come on.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.959
- What about Austin?
- Oh, he'll find it.

43:21.207 --> 43:23.252
- Cowabunga, dude!

43:29.824 --> 43:31.565
- It's a beautiful day.

43:31.652 --> 43:33.611
- It is.

43:33.698 --> 43:35.047
It's almost a perfect day,

43:36.396 --> 43:38.703
besides one notable exception.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.749
- This isn't my idea of
a perfect day either, bro, okay?

43:44.273 --> 43:45.492
- Well, we wouldn't have
a cabinet come to

43:45.579 --> 43:48.277
if I hadn't saved
the family business.

43:48.364 --> 43:49.888
- So that's what this is about,
huh?

43:49.975 --> 43:51.933
Why don't you just let it go?

43:52.020 --> 43:54.066
Stop holding
it over all of our heads.

43:54.980 --> 43:55.981
- Maybe I will.

43:57.504 --> 43:59.288
Maybe I won't.

43:59.375 --> 44:02.422
- Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.

44:02.509 --> 44:07.514
Maybe I will.

44:29.101 --> 44:30.972
- Wow, they're really good.

44:39.285 --> 44:41.635
- Yeah, I don't know
how they got that good.

44:41.722 --> 44:43.071
- I could have been that good

44:43.158 --> 44:44.812
if I wasn't busy runnin'
the family business.

44:44.899 --> 44:46.727
- I've had enough!

44:47.597 --> 44:49.469
That's it.

44:53.081 --> 44:54.430
- He'll be fine.

44:57.956 --> 44:59.653
Come on. Come on.

45:06.181 --> 45:09.315
- Guys, you are bringing
the wrong energy
to the mountain.

45:09.402 --> 45:11.447
You gotta let this go.

45:11.534 --> 45:12.753
Good vibes only, bros.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.757
- Doing?

45:16.844 --> 45:18.672
- What are you doing?

45:22.067 --> 45:24.722
- So how are you doing?

45:24.809 --> 45:26.332
-
Honestly, I'm thinking

45:26.419 --> 45:27.681
another quiet Christmas alone

45:27.768 --> 45:30.466
is sounding more pleasant
by the minute.

45:30.553 --> 45:32.338
I'll probably head home
tomorrow.

45:32.425 --> 45:35.341
- You know, they really
are both sweet guys.

45:35.428 --> 45:37.430
It's just a crazy situation

45:37.517 --> 45:40.172
that is bringing out
the worst in them.

45:40.259 --> 45:42.348
I mean, look at them.
They're ridiculous.

45:44.393 --> 45:45.743
- Dude, your chewing
is killin' me.

45:45.830 --> 45:47.135
- What?
- The chewing.

45:49.442 --> 45:53.446
- It really is loud. It really
is particularly loud chewing.

45:53.533 --> 45:56.014
- I say
you're all the way up here,

45:56.101 --> 45:57.842
and the roads aren't safe.

45:57.929 --> 46:02.194
The mountain air is fresh.
The skiing is fabulous.

46:02.281 --> 46:04.413
Spend another day
getting to know them.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.414
See what happens?

46:13.553 --> 46:15.120
You okay, baby?

46:19.341 --> 46:21.126
- I don't even wanna look.

46:21.213 --> 46:23.302
- He's okay, he's just...

46:33.312 --> 46:34.617
- So...

46:34.704 --> 46:36.532
- Uh, I think
I'm gonna take off.

46:36.619 --> 46:38.099
- You sure you don't
wanna stay for dinner?

46:38.186 --> 46:39.840
- No, I...

46:39.927 --> 46:41.624
I've had enough excitement
for the day.

46:41.711 --> 46:46.281
- Well, can I take you out
for lunch tomorrow then?

46:46.368 --> 46:48.022
- Sure.

46:48.109 --> 46:50.938
- Okay, then I'll see you
for lunch tomorrow.

46:51.025 --> 46:52.853
- Okay.
- All right.

46:56.422 --> 46:59.947
- Holly!
Hey, wait up. Uh...

47:00.034 --> 47:02.863
Uh, do you wanna
do somethin' tomorrow,
like lunch or somethin'?

47:04.604 --> 47:09.174
- Uh, I kind
of already have plans.

47:09.261 --> 47:10.262
- Tom?

47:11.698 --> 47:12.742
Of course.

47:13.918 --> 47:16.094
Well, what about dinner?

47:16.181 --> 47:19.488
Come on, I know
the nicest spot in town.

47:19.575 --> 47:23.231
- I mean,
should we tell Tom?

47:23.318 --> 47:24.929
I don't really know how
to navigate this whole thing.

47:25.016 --> 47:28.106
- Nah, no. Believe me,
this isn't our first dust-up.

47:28.193 --> 47:29.585
It's cool.
- Really?

47:29.672 --> 47:30.891
- Yeah, he already knows.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.894
- Has anybody see my wallet?

47:36.201 --> 47:37.985
- So, uh, dinner?

47:42.642 --> 47:44.122
He's standing behind me,
isn't he?

47:44.209 --> 47:45.166
- Yeah.

47:45.253 --> 47:46.689
- Yeah.

47:46.776 --> 47:48.474
All right, well...

47:49.170 --> 47:50.128
Bye.

47:50.215 --> 47:51.216
- Bye.

47:58.092 --> 47:59.093
- Come on!

48:06.187 --> 48:08.015
- Look, I think you're
getting ahead of yourself.

48:08.102 --> 48:11.236
Just relax. Take a deep breath.

48:11.323 --> 48:14.326
- I can't believe
this is happening.

48:14.413 --> 48:17.982
Vicky, they're brothers.
Of course it's a big deal.

48:18.069 --> 48:20.201
- Yeah, it's not like you're
serious with either one of 'em.

48:21.855 --> 48:23.422
- I just think I should go home.

48:23.509 --> 48:25.293
- <i>I think you're overreacting.</i>

48:25.380 --> 48:28.906
Look, last week you didn't have
any guys. Now you have two.

48:28.993 --> 48:30.211
- It's not like that.

48:30.298 --> 48:31.517
- I mean, sure,
they're brothers,

48:31.604 --> 48:34.607
but that would be kind of hot.
- Vicky!

48:34.694 --> 48:36.870
- <i>Okay.
All right, all right.</i>

48:36.957 --> 48:40.134
Jokes aside, just let 'em
take out, show you the sites.

48:40.221 --> 48:43.007
Maybe by the end
of the holidays,
you'll find love.

48:43.094 --> 48:44.356
- Really?

48:44.443 --> 48:45.661
- From where I'm sitting,

48:45.748 --> 48:47.098
it sounds like
you have two Mr. Rights.

48:47.185 --> 48:48.360
<i>Now you just have to pick one.</i>

48:51.841 --> 48:54.192
- Two Mr. Rights.

48:54.279 --> 48:56.150
- Yeah. That's what I said.

48:56.237 --> 49:00.067
- No, that was my wish
at Santa's cottage.

49:00.154 --> 49:02.896
Well, not exactly,
but I repeated it, and...

49:04.202 --> 49:06.769
and now here I am.

49:06.856 --> 49:09.685
- <i>You don't really
believe in all that Christmas
magic nonsense, do you?</i>

49:25.832 --> 49:27.225
- Hi.

49:30.619 --> 49:31.881
Oh, thank you.

49:36.538 --> 49:37.539
- After you.

49:39.759 --> 49:42.718
Oh, thank you.

49:42.805 --> 49:44.546
I really appreciate
you giving this a second chance,
by the way.

49:44.633 --> 49:46.157
I know things
have been a little tenuous

49:46.244 --> 49:48.333
the last few days.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.422
- Yeah. This place is beautiful.

49:50.509 --> 49:52.424
- Well, it's the nicest
restaurant in town.

49:54.121 --> 49:57.255
So, um, I have to ask you,
Holly,

49:57.342 --> 49:58.865
where do you see yourself
in five years?

50:00.432 --> 50:02.173
- What do you mean?

50:02.260 --> 50:04.392
- Well, you're a very driven
person. You're always working.

50:04.479 --> 50:08.222
I was just wondering
what you're workin' towards.

50:08.309 --> 50:10.659
- I guess
I never really thought about it.

50:10.746 --> 50:12.183
- Really?

50:12.270 --> 50:13.706
- Yeah. I mean,
honestly, sometimes I feel

50:13.793 --> 50:15.055
like I'm running away
from something

50:15.142 --> 50:17.579
instead of running
towards something.

50:17.666 --> 50:20.408
You know what I mean?

50:20.495 --> 50:22.062
- What I do know is
all your talking about running

50:22.149 --> 50:24.630
has built up my appetite.

50:24.717 --> 50:26.545
-
- The Giardino here
is fantastic.

50:26.632 --> 50:29.243
Do you like fish?
I'll order it for us.

50:29.330 --> 50:31.028
It's great.
You're gonna love it.

50:44.563 --> 50:46.086
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.438
- Oh, wow, is that your car?

50:50.525 --> 50:52.092
- Yeah.

50:52.179 --> 50:54.094
Sorry, I haven't had a chance
to get the heater fixed.

50:54.181 --> 50:55.182
- The heater?

50:56.227 --> 50:57.489
What about the doors?

50:59.665 --> 51:02.189
- Don't worry, I got blankets.
We'll bundle you up.

51:02.276 --> 51:03.886
- Okay.

51:47.234 --> 51:49.584
- Hey, uh, Wright for two.
- Mm-hmm, yep.

51:49.671 --> 51:51.195
- Follow me.
- Oh great, thanks.

51:53.545 --> 51:55.242
All right.

51:55.329 --> 51:57.549
- You're back.

51:57.636 --> 52:00.987
I-- I mean,
welcome to the Café Galleria.

52:01.074 --> 52:03.598
This will be your snow globe.

52:03.685 --> 52:07.254
Here, I'll give you a few
moments to look over the menu.

52:16.655 --> 52:17.656
- Menu?

52:21.660 --> 52:23.575
- Wait a minute.

52:23.662 --> 52:27.231
- Yeah. Your brother
brought me here for lunch.

52:28.536 --> 52:31.365
- Look, it's fine.

52:31.452 --> 52:34.194
- I mean, this is the nicest
spot in town.

52:34.281 --> 52:36.457
- I don't mind.
Lunch was really good.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.641
- I'm sorry, sir, but a proper
jacket is required for dinner.

52:47.729 --> 52:49.688
- What?

52:49.775 --> 52:52.169
- You must wear the jacket.

52:53.735 --> 52:55.041
Please.

52:55.128 --> 52:57.652
- Oh, um.
Oh, oh yeah, sorry, of course.

52:57.739 --> 52:59.698
I should have...

53:01.613 --> 53:03.571
Obviously,
I don't come here too often.

53:13.538 --> 53:14.495
Could you?

53:14.582 --> 53:15.844
- Yep.

53:15.931 --> 53:17.585
Wait, hang on, give me...
Hold on a second.

53:17.672 --> 53:18.934
- Thanks.

53:19.021 --> 53:20.284
- Okay.

53:21.459 --> 53:23.374
- Wait, there's some...

53:30.511 --> 53:31.817
- Are you okay?

53:31.904 --> 53:33.079
- Yep, it's not you.

53:34.646 --> 53:36.125
- Excuse me?

53:36.213 --> 53:39.564
- I mean, it's me.
Actually, it's Tom, really.

53:39.651 --> 53:41.087
He's a good guy, okay.

53:41.174 --> 53:43.655
We just don't usually
see eye to eye on things.

53:43.742 --> 53:48.137
We've got very different
values and perspective on

53:49.182 --> 53:50.401
everything.

53:52.185 --> 53:53.230
- I see.

53:55.841 --> 53:58.583
- And, uh...

53:58.670 --> 54:00.933
- And, uh?

54:01.020 --> 54:02.891
- You know, it's just,
guys like Tom,

54:02.978 --> 54:04.241
they shouldn't always win.

54:08.157 --> 54:10.334
- I'm not something
to be won, Austin.

54:11.857 --> 54:13.772
- No, of course, it's not...

54:13.859 --> 54:15.426
That's not what I meant.

54:15.513 --> 54:17.036
This jacket, I...

54:17.123 --> 54:19.386
My hand is stuck in it,
and I can't get it out.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.266
- You're a disaster.

54:29.353 --> 54:30.441
- You think?

54:32.921 --> 54:34.923
- Do you wanna get out of here?

54:35.010 --> 54:37.012
- Yes. Can we please?

54:37.099 --> 54:38.971
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

54:39.058 --> 54:41.365
- Here.
- This jacket.

54:41.452 --> 54:42.670
- Go.

55:05.519 --> 55:06.868
- Liz?

55:06.955 --> 55:08.870
- Yes, what can I get for you?

55:10.350 --> 55:12.396
Tom.

55:12.483 --> 55:13.571
- Liz.

55:13.658 --> 55:16.748
Oh my gosh, it's been so long.

55:16.835 --> 55:18.793
- Yes, it has.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.229
You know, I don't think
I've seen you

55:20.317 --> 55:22.101
since that night you
made me wait three hours

55:22.188 --> 55:23.407
for the fall formal.

55:23.494 --> 55:24.364
- You remission that, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

55:24.451 --> 55:25.844
- That was not my fault.

55:25.931 --> 55:27.106
I should never have gone
for the real bow tie.

55:27.193 --> 55:28.412
They were impossible.

55:28.499 --> 55:29.848
- You are still stickin'
with that story?

55:29.935 --> 55:30.936
- I'm stickin' to it
'cause it's the truth.

55:32.198 --> 55:33.808
- Okay.

55:33.895 --> 55:35.854
- You look great, Liz.

55:35.941 --> 55:37.029
- Thank you.

55:37.116 --> 55:39.205
How are you? How is your family?

55:39.292 --> 55:42.121
- We're doin' good. I'm runnin'
the family business now.

55:42.208 --> 55:44.384
- Oh, how's that going?

55:44.471 --> 55:46.865
- Um, well, you know, um,

55:46.952 --> 55:49.084
market volatility has challenged
our investment strategy,

55:49.171 --> 55:50.999
but we're weathering the storm.

55:51.086 --> 55:53.350
- Wow, impressive.

55:53.437 --> 55:54.742
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

55:58.137 --> 56:00.879
- Uh, you know, I have
a proposition for you,

56:00.966 --> 56:02.359
Mr. Finance Guy.

56:03.055 --> 56:04.491
- Okay.

56:04.578 --> 56:06.101
- I have a bake that I
need to get in the oven.

56:06.188 --> 56:08.147
So if you help me, then
the coffee's on the house.

56:08.234 --> 56:11.672
It is a 100% savings.

56:11.759 --> 56:12.891
- That sounds like
a business opportunity

56:12.978 --> 56:14.414
I should not pass up.

56:14.501 --> 56:16.590
- Besides, you look like
you could use a cookie.

56:16.677 --> 56:17.896
Take that off.

56:17.983 --> 56:19.071
- Take, take this off?
- Mm-hmm.

56:19.158 --> 56:20.333
- Okay.

56:21.073 --> 56:22.161
All right.

56:27.384 --> 56:29.603
So, um, you know, I've never
really baked cookies before.

56:29.690 --> 56:31.300
- Really?

56:31.388 --> 56:32.040
- Well, a little bit with
my grandmother growin' up,

56:32.127 --> 56:33.520
but not much.

56:33.607 --> 56:34.739
- Okay, put this on.
- I gotta wear this?

56:34.826 --> 56:36.218
- Mm-hmm.

56:36.305 --> 56:38.264
- Okay. What do we do with this?
What do we do?

56:38.351 --> 56:39.396
Just put the down there?
- Yeah, right here, yep.

56:39.483 --> 56:40.658
- Okay.

56:40.745 --> 56:41.702
Wow.
- See?

56:41.789 --> 56:43.878
- Wow.
- Yes.

56:43.965 --> 56:46.315
- Ah, so it doesn't stick
on the thing.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.230
- Yeah.
- I like that.

56:48.317 --> 56:50.232
Oh, oh yeah.

56:50.319 --> 56:52.234
Oh yeah, now we got
a snowman cookie.

56:53.410 --> 56:55.716
Ah! That was a snowman!

56:55.803 --> 56:56.891
Oh.

56:58.153 --> 56:59.546
Oh, that's a tree, all right.

56:59.633 --> 57:02.027
Look at that.
- Yeah, okay. Let's...

57:02.114 --> 57:03.463
And that way.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.206
- Did I do it?
- Yeah.

57:08.773 --> 57:11.645
- So you work for
a mom-and-pop business.

57:11.732 --> 57:13.473
That is not
an easy business model.

57:13.560 --> 57:14.822
- I know.

57:14.909 --> 57:17.216
- I mean, the margins
are just so slim,

57:17.303 --> 57:19.000
even in the best of times.

57:19.087 --> 57:20.741
- Totally.
- Yeah.

57:20.828 --> 57:22.613
- Yeah, gotta be
a complete lunatic

57:22.700 --> 57:23.788
to own a place like this.

57:23.875 --> 57:26.138
- I agree.

57:26.225 --> 57:28.140
- Yeah, it's mine.

57:28.227 --> 57:29.924
- What is?
- This place.

57:30.011 --> 57:32.144
I own this place.

57:32.231 --> 57:34.059
- This place?
- Yeah.

57:34.146 --> 57:37.192
- This, this is, this is your--
- Yeah.

57:38.498 --> 57:39.499
- I love it. I love this place.

57:39.586 --> 57:41.458
- It's okay.
- No, I do.

57:41.545 --> 57:43.547
I love it, I mean, it's...

57:43.634 --> 57:44.809
The decor in here is great,

57:44.896 --> 57:46.245
and the marketing strategy
is great,

57:46.332 --> 57:47.812
and you clearly have
best-in-class goods.

57:47.899 --> 57:49.857
- Okay.
-

57:49.944 --> 57:51.555
Look, I bought this
place for me.

57:53.165 --> 57:55.689
- Well, I like that.

57:55.776 --> 57:58.039
- We do have three
very strict rules

57:58.126 --> 57:59.171
that you should know about.

57:59.258 --> 58:02.087
One, no fur unless it's fake.

58:02.174 --> 58:04.002
Number two, unless it's a dog,

58:04.089 --> 58:07.092
and then you're required
to stop in and say hello.

58:07.179 --> 58:09.877
And number three, probably
the most important rule,

58:09.964 --> 58:12.140
if the weather forecast calls
for anything more than
two inches of snow,

58:12.227 --> 58:14.447
then we are closed.

58:14.534 --> 58:16.275
- Doesn't a sense of propriety
ever sneak in there, Liz?

58:16.362 --> 58:17.537
I mean, you'd be closin'
your doors

58:17.624 --> 58:19.017
at what I would think would be

58:19.104 --> 58:20.714
some of your most
profitable hours.

58:20.801 --> 58:23.369
- Well, that was
the whole point of this place

58:23.456 --> 58:24.849
was for me to make my own rules.

58:24.936 --> 58:27.025
Look, I love what I do,
and I pride myself

58:27.112 --> 58:30.376
on being the best baker
I can possibly be.

58:30.463 --> 58:34.075
But I work to live, not
the other way around.

58:38.166 --> 58:41.518
- I guess I am a little
jealous of Austin's freedom.

58:41.605 --> 58:43.737
And Seth, well, you know Seth.

58:43.824 --> 58:45.217
- Oh.

58:45.304 --> 58:47.132
- He's, uh, he's got a
little too much freedom.

58:47.219 --> 58:49.569
- Oh, Seth.

58:53.399 --> 58:54.705
- Oh no, no.

58:54.792 --> 58:56.228
No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

58:56.315 --> 58:57.969
- Uh, I gotta go.

58:58.056 --> 58:59.536
I got a family thing I
totally forgot about.

58:59.623 --> 59:01.538
I'm late for it.
Um, I'll see you soon.

59:01.625 --> 59:02.713
- Yeah, I hope so.

59:02.800 --> 59:05.150
- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

59:26.171 --> 59:29.478
- <i>Video games are half
price, everyone, half price.</i>

59:29.566 --> 59:30.697
- Oh, it's on.

59:30.784 --> 59:32.569
- Okay, all right.
-

59:59.683 --> 1:00:02.381
- Oh, you could put butter on
anything, and it'd taste good.

1:00:02.468 --> 1:00:03.861
- The more the merrier.

1:00:03.948 --> 1:00:05.950
- Lather up my boot.
It would be delicious.

1:00:06.037 --> 1:00:10.041
- I mean, I was thinkin'
more like a bagel, but sure.

1:00:10.128 --> 1:00:11.738
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

1:00:11.825 --> 1:00:14.088
I was just, I was thinkin'
a little outside the box.

1:00:15.742 --> 1:00:18.745
- You're an odd one,
Austin Wright.

1:00:18.832 --> 1:00:22.531
I mean, who doesn't have
a cellphone these days?

1:00:23.315 --> 1:00:25.099
- Me.

1:00:25.186 --> 1:00:27.841
I don't know,
a landline works just fine.

1:00:27.928 --> 1:00:30.191
- You could have the collective
knowledge of the world

1:00:30.278 --> 1:00:31.889
at your fingertips.

1:00:31.976 --> 1:00:34.587
I mean, do you really just
wanna check out like that?

1:00:36.110 --> 1:00:39.461
- Check out? More like check in.

1:00:39.548 --> 1:00:42.987
I don't know. I just think
they're just such a distraction.

1:00:43.074 --> 1:00:45.163
- What if something
important happens?

1:00:45.250 --> 1:00:47.034
How you gonna know?

1:00:47.121 --> 1:00:48.775
- If it's important enough,
I'll know.

1:00:50.995 --> 1:00:54.346
Although, you know, there is

1:00:54.433 --> 1:00:55.956
one important thing that's
startin' to make me think

1:00:56.043 --> 1:00:57.741
I should get a cellphone.

1:00:57.828 --> 1:00:59.743
- Oh yeah? What's that?

1:01:01.527 --> 1:01:03.877
- I don't wanna miss
another text from you again.

1:01:08.055 --> 1:01:10.797
- Hey, guys!

1:01:10.884 --> 1:01:12.625
- Hey, what are you guys
doin' here?

1:01:12.712 --> 1:01:14.496
- Tom called us,
invited us bowling.

1:01:16.803 --> 1:01:17.935
- What a coinkydink.

1:01:18.022 --> 1:01:19.937
I love it here.

1:01:20.024 --> 1:01:21.460
I love throwin' the old
eight-ball down
the wooden runway,

1:01:21.547 --> 1:01:23.636
just hangin' out with
the laid-back townfolk.

1:01:24.681 --> 1:01:26.465
Hey.

1:01:27.945 --> 1:01:29.816
So great to see you both here.

1:01:36.823 --> 1:01:41.045
- Ladies and gentlemen, it
is 7:00 pm, karaoke time.

1:01:41.132 --> 1:01:43.700
Karaoke? Who's first, huh?

1:01:45.484 --> 1:01:47.573
- Where did Tom go?

1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:51.098
- Check, check, check.

1:01:51.185 --> 1:01:53.361
Can I get a little more
reverb on this, please?

1:01:53.448 --> 1:01:54.623
- Yeah, I got you, bro.

1:01:56.364 --> 1:01:57.844
- Thank you, bro.

1:01:57.931 --> 1:02:00.542
- Looks like Tommy's
pullin' out all the stops.

1:02:00.629 --> 1:02:03.850
The question is, what are
you gonna do about it?

1:02:03.937 --> 1:02:06.070
Everyone, this is going out
to a, um,

1:02:06.157 --> 1:02:08.550
to a very special someone.

1:02:08.637 --> 1:02:11.815

1:04:05.537 --> 1:04:06.886
Okay.

1:04:08.801 --> 1:04:10.629
I won. I won.

1:04:15.677 --> 1:04:17.984
- Holly, wait!

1:04:18.071 --> 1:04:20.726
Look, I know this isn't ideal,

1:04:20.813 --> 1:04:23.555
or anything even
close to normal,

1:04:23.642 --> 1:04:26.384
but come on, I really think
we have somethin' here.

1:04:26.471 --> 1:04:28.865
- Holly, wait! Wait.

1:04:30.954 --> 1:04:32.390
I am so sorry this has happened.

1:04:32.477 --> 1:04:34.871
- You guys,
I can't do this anymore.

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:36.698
It's too much.

1:04:36.785 --> 1:04:40.267
I think it's clear I obviously
bring out the worst in you.

1:04:40.354 --> 1:04:41.573
I don't wanna be the reason

1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:43.923
you guys grow
even further apart.

1:04:44.010 --> 1:04:45.664
This is the time of year

1:04:45.751 --> 1:04:49.320
when families should be
coming together, not fighting.

1:04:49.407 --> 1:04:52.671
You're brothers, and
it's almost Christmas.

1:04:55.152 --> 1:04:56.675
Happy holidays.

1:05:02.855 --> 1:05:04.204
- Look what you did!

1:05:09.644 --> 1:05:12.125
- It got out
of hand, Vick.

1:05:12.212 --> 1:05:15.607
- Two men battling for you?
Huh, that's the dream, Holly.

1:05:15.694 --> 1:05:18.001
<i>- Trust me, they did not
look like men.</i>

1:05:18.088 --> 1:05:22.309
They looked like two boys
fighting over a shiny new toy.

1:05:22.396 --> 1:05:26.574
They're both great guys,
but this is out of control.

1:05:26.661 --> 1:05:28.707
- Okay, before
the brotherly quarrel,

1:05:28.794 --> 1:05:30.100
who would you have picked?

1:05:32.363 --> 1:05:36.541
- Well, Tom is focused
and driven, like me.

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:40.284
And Austin is

1:05:40.371 --> 1:05:43.156
spontaneous, sensitive.

1:05:44.853 --> 1:05:46.420
He's a mess.

1:05:46.507 --> 1:05:48.770
And I kind of love it.

1:05:48.857 --> 1:05:52.035
- <i>Wait,
what did you just say?</i>

1:05:52.122 --> 1:05:53.950
- Well, not like that.

1:05:56.996 --> 1:05:59.433
At least,
I don't think like that.

1:06:01.566 --> 1:06:04.264
Maybe I'm not supposed to
be with either one of them.

1:06:04.351 --> 1:06:05.918
<i>- There's someone
out there for you,</i>

1:06:06.005 --> 1:06:08.399
even if it's not Tom or Austin.

1:06:08.486 --> 1:06:10.705
This was a huge step
in the right direction.

1:06:12.142 --> 1:06:14.579
So what are you gonna do?

1:06:14.666 --> 1:06:17.190
- I'm gonna spend
Christmas Eve here alone,

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:19.671
and in the morning, I'll
drive back down the mountain.

1:06:19.758 --> 1:06:21.368
- Really?

1:06:21.455 --> 1:06:23.849
- You have made this such
a special holiday for me,

1:06:23.936 --> 1:06:27.374
but it's time
to get back to reality.

1:06:27.461 --> 1:06:30.160
I just need to go home.

1:06:30.247 --> 1:06:32.858
- Well, let me know what
to do either way.

1:06:32.945 --> 1:06:35.165
I love you. I'm here for you.

1:06:35.252 --> 1:06:37.645
<i>- Thanks. I love you too.</i>

1:06:38.603 --> 1:06:39.952
Merry Christmas.

1:07:00.755 --> 1:07:01.974
- May I come in?

1:07:03.106 --> 1:07:04.237
- Of course.

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:16.467
- You got a little somethin'
for the tea?

1:07:16.554 --> 1:07:18.251
- Yeah, there's sugar, cream.

1:07:18.338 --> 1:07:20.427
I could find you some honey
if you'd like.

1:07:20.514 --> 1:07:22.038
- Somethin' a little harder?

1:07:24.866 --> 1:07:26.303
- I don't think this cabin
came stocked

1:07:26.390 --> 1:07:28.087
with Christmas spirits.

1:07:28.174 --> 1:07:29.610
- Don't bother,
there was enough spirit

1:07:29.697 --> 1:07:31.482
in the bowling alley tonight.

1:07:31.569 --> 1:07:33.136
How you holdin' up?

1:07:34.311 --> 1:07:35.747
- I just...

1:07:35.834 --> 1:07:38.402
They're...

1:07:38.489 --> 1:07:40.317
I'm driving home in the morning.

1:07:40.404 --> 1:07:42.754
- And?

1:07:42.841 --> 1:07:46.192
- And I can certainly
say it's been eventful.

1:07:46.279 --> 1:07:49.195
- Well, good. Who wants to
have a boring life anyway?

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:54.418
- Actually, predictable sounds
pretty good at the moment.

1:07:54.505 --> 1:07:56.333
- When I met my Raymond,

1:07:58.074 --> 1:08:00.598
Harry and I were still dating
at the time.

1:08:00.685 --> 1:08:02.469
And Harry was a wonderful man.

1:08:02.556 --> 1:08:06.299
We had so much in common, way
more than Raymond and I did.

1:08:06.386 --> 1:08:09.433
Harry was a musician.
I was a singer.

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:11.652
It seemed to be perfect.

1:08:11.739 --> 1:08:15.091
Raymond, on the other hand,
and I were almost opposites.

1:08:15.178 --> 1:08:18.529
But that made our life
so interesting.

1:08:18.616 --> 1:08:22.446
You know, he had his
opinion. I had my opinion.

1:08:22.533 --> 1:08:24.361
Things would heat up.
We would quarrel.

1:08:24.448 --> 1:08:26.928
But you know, dear, you
gotta have the friction

1:08:27.015 --> 1:08:28.800
to have the heat.

1:08:31.716 --> 1:08:34.893
- Look, Holly,
Tommy is gonna be fine.

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:39.245
He is very driven, and he's
always gonna find a way

1:08:39.332 --> 1:08:42.074
to make something work,

1:08:42.161 --> 1:08:46.470
Austin, well, he's
a very sensitive man.

1:08:46.557 --> 1:08:49.081
He sees the world
different than most.

1:08:50.909 --> 1:08:53.172
- You can say that again.

1:08:53.259 --> 1:08:56.132
- And I see that you
appreciate that in him.

1:08:57.916 --> 1:08:59.004
There's somethin' there.

1:09:00.397 --> 1:09:01.920
It's very special.

1:09:03.095 --> 1:09:04.357
And you both know it.

1:09:06.794 --> 1:09:10.015
But look, I'm never one to
pry. It's just not my way.

1:09:15.281 --> 1:09:17.457
- Do you know what ever
happened to Harry?

1:09:21.069 --> 1:09:24.116
- I don't.

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:26.945
But I still think about
Harry Shaw now and then.

1:09:31.341 --> 1:09:34.561
We had such a marvelous
time together way back when.

1:09:36.781 --> 1:09:38.609
I just hope he's happy.

1:09:42.787 --> 1:09:44.136
Gotta get goin'.

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:45.877
Can't let the horse
get too cold.

1:09:54.799 --> 1:09:56.583
Sleep on it, dear.

1:09:56.670 --> 1:09:59.978
Before you go,
give it one last shot.

1:10:00.065 --> 1:10:02.981
You'll be glad that you
did.

1:10:50.985 --> 1:10:54.467
- I know I've already cashed
in two Christmas wishes,

1:10:54.554 --> 1:10:57.470
but if I could just have
one more,

1:10:57.557 --> 1:10:59.211
I just want everyone
to be happy.

1:11:50.131 --> 1:11:52.090
- Tom.

1:11:52.177 --> 1:11:53.352
- Liz?

1:11:58.401 --> 1:11:59.967
Did you just close up?

1:12:00.054 --> 1:12:02.709
- Yeah, well, there's
snow in the forecast, so.

1:12:02.796 --> 1:12:03.841
- So you definitely closed up.

1:12:05.930 --> 1:12:08.019
I'm sorry I had to run out
on you the other night.

1:12:08.106 --> 1:12:09.499
I didn't want to.

1:12:12.937 --> 1:12:14.591
Can I walk you to your car?

1:12:14.678 --> 1:12:16.027
- Sure.

1:12:16.114 --> 1:12:17.594
- Okay.

1:12:19.813 --> 1:12:21.815
- We're here.

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:28.692
- You know, I was actually
thinking a lot

1:12:28.779 --> 1:12:30.389
about what you said
the other night.

1:12:33.392 --> 1:12:34.741
About life.

1:12:34.828 --> 1:12:36.090
- Oh yeah?

1:12:37.875 --> 1:12:40.007
- You might have a point.

1:12:40.094 --> 1:12:45.012
- Well, I made a lot of points.
You gotta be more specific.

1:12:45.099 --> 1:12:49.930
- When you said that I wasn't
really living for myself,

1:12:50.017 --> 1:12:53.107
I was just living to
keep up the status quo.

1:12:53.194 --> 1:12:54.848
- Hmm, did I say that?

1:12:54.935 --> 1:12:55.893
- Yeah.

1:12:55.980 --> 1:12:57.155
- Wow, I'm so wise.

1:13:00.811 --> 1:13:03.944
- Do you remember that
winter in 2011, when, um--

1:13:04.031 --> 1:13:06.773
- When it kept snowing
and snowing and snowing.

1:13:06.860 --> 1:13:08.427
- Yeah, yeah, and then
the sun would come out,

1:13:08.514 --> 1:13:10.864
and we'd have bluebird powder
day after bluebird powder day?

1:13:12.649 --> 1:13:14.215
- You know, if I had
had my bakery back then,

1:13:14.302 --> 1:13:17.262
I would've spent
the entire winter closed.

1:13:17.349 --> 1:13:18.481
- I bet you would've.

1:13:22.398 --> 1:13:25.313
That was the last time
I felt free.

1:13:27.881 --> 1:13:29.187
- Well, it's not too late.

1:13:32.843 --> 1:13:34.148
- For what?

1:13:34.235 --> 1:13:35.585
- To feel that way again.

1:13:39.676 --> 1:13:42.374
- That's easier said than done.

1:13:42.461 --> 1:13:44.637
- Mm, some things are
better done than said.

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:55.866
Goodnight, Tom.

1:13:59.565 --> 1:14:00.827
Thanks.

1:14:27.071 --> 1:14:29.682
- Austin, how
do you really, truly feel?

1:14:32.642 --> 1:14:36.428
- You wanna know how I feel?
I'll tell you how I feel.

1:14:36.515 --> 1:14:38.343
She's the first thing I
think about when I wake up,

1:14:38.430 --> 1:14:41.215
and she's the last thing I
think about when I go to sleep.

1:14:42.478 --> 1:14:44.349
- But?

1:14:44.436 --> 1:14:47.395
- But Tom is my brother.

1:14:48.788 --> 1:14:50.486
I just, I can't...

1:14:52.313 --> 1:14:53.880
I can't do that to him.

1:14:55.578 --> 1:14:56.883
- I see.

1:14:56.970 --> 1:14:58.711
- It's hard for me
to admit this.

1:15:01.192 --> 1:15:02.193
But I look up to him.

1:15:04.108 --> 1:15:05.675
Always have.

1:15:05.762 --> 1:15:07.807
- Have you told your brother
how you feel?

1:15:07.894 --> 1:15:10.506
- No, no, no way.

1:15:10.593 --> 1:15:12.203
Can't do that.

1:15:12.290 --> 1:15:14.640
No, even if I did, he
doesn't care what I think.

1:15:14.727 --> 1:15:16.381
He doesn't care what I say.

1:15:18.688 --> 1:15:22.605
You know Tom. He's so
ambitious, driven, confident.

1:15:24.171 --> 1:15:26.739
I wish I was more like him.

1:15:26.826 --> 1:15:33.267
He just took over the
responsibilities when
Dad passed, and

1:15:33.354 --> 1:15:36.880
that was fine, and don't get
me wrong, I'm so grateful.

1:15:36.967 --> 1:15:39.230
But I just wish he wouldn't
hold it over my head.

1:15:41.972 --> 1:15:46.237
Anyway, no matter how
much I care about Holly,

1:15:49.022 --> 1:15:50.110
family comes first.

1:16:02.166 --> 1:16:03.689
- Hey.

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:06.387
- Hey.

1:16:07.824 --> 1:16:10.566
How long you been
standin' there?

1:16:15.658 --> 1:16:17.050
- Long enough.

1:16:18.922 --> 1:16:20.401
I do care what you think.

1:16:21.402 --> 1:16:23.187
I'm proud of the man you are.

1:16:24.057 --> 1:16:25.276
I've always been envious
of your ability

1:16:25.363 --> 1:16:27.365
to go after what
you want in life.

1:16:27.452 --> 1:16:30.063
I wish I had passion like
that to go after somethin'.

1:16:34.024 --> 1:16:36.809
- You took over Dad's company
and kept his legacy goin'.

1:16:38.463 --> 1:16:40.508
Those were some pretty big
shoes you were asked to fill.

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:43.511
And you did it.
I could never do that.

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:45.426
- You help the family out
in other ways.

1:16:46.732 --> 1:16:48.299
And steppin' into Dad's shoes

1:16:48.386 --> 1:16:50.083
was honestly the most convenient
thing that I could do.

1:16:51.563 --> 1:16:52.912
I didn't have anything else.

1:16:55.393 --> 1:16:57.961
- But all that hard work is
the reason we're all together.

1:16:59.527 --> 1:17:00.920
- I love you, brother.

1:17:01.007 --> 1:17:02.400
- I love you too, bro.

1:17:07.579 --> 1:17:09.363
- Let me ask you somethin'.

1:17:09.450 --> 1:17:11.365
What you said about Holly,
is that true?

1:17:11.452 --> 1:17:12.802
- Do you love her?

1:17:15.456 --> 1:17:17.154
- Yeah, I think I do.

1:17:20.157 --> 1:17:21.549
I know I do.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:25.466
But don't worry.
Family comes first.

1:17:25.553 --> 1:17:26.990
- Exactly.

1:17:28.078 --> 1:17:29.253
So go after her.

1:17:30.341 --> 1:17:31.472
- What?

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:34.998
She's a really great lady.

1:17:35.085 --> 1:17:36.695
And you are the right man
for her.

1:17:38.349 --> 1:17:40.003
- You serious?
- Yeah.

1:17:40.090 --> 1:17:41.569
- Better hurry up.

1:17:41.657 --> 1:17:43.180
I know she's plannin' on
drivin' down the mountain.

1:17:43.267 --> 1:17:44.529
She's leavin' any minute.

1:17:44.616 --> 1:17:47.010
- What are you
waitin' here for? Go.

1:17:47.097 --> 1:17:48.707
Go on!
- Okay.

1:17:51.928 --> 1:17:53.451
- Go get her, bro.

1:18:00.197 --> 1:18:01.720
- I forgot my jacket.

1:18:03.591 --> 1:18:05.289
- Merry Christmas.

1:18:10.773 --> 1:18:12.209
- Merry Christmas, bro.

1:18:45.155 --> 1:18:46.634
- Holly!

1:18:49.986 --> 1:18:52.902
I'm an idiot, okay.

1:18:52.989 --> 1:18:54.730
I should have at least
tried to communicate to you

1:18:54.817 --> 1:18:56.253
the way I was really feeling.

1:18:58.342 --> 1:19:02.172
Look, I should have handled
my brother like an adult.

1:19:04.043 --> 1:19:07.046
I talked to Tom, and we...

1:19:07.133 --> 1:19:10.702
I respect whatever you decide.

1:19:12.138 --> 1:19:13.923
I guess what I'm trying
to say is

1:19:15.054 --> 1:19:17.274
you're the most amazing
girl I have ever met.

1:19:19.711 --> 1:19:22.540
And I have completely fallen...

1:19:55.573 --> 1:19:57.357
- Get a room, you two.

1:19:59.011 --> 1:20:00.230
- Sorry.

1:20:00.317 --> 1:20:01.622
- I wasn't talking to you.

1:20:07.628 --> 1:20:11.415
- I hope you guys don't
mind, I invited a guest.

1:20:11.502 --> 1:20:14.157
Like Grandma always says,
the more the merrier.

1:20:15.985 --> 1:20:17.377
- I got a surprise.

1:20:17.464 --> 1:20:19.902
I got a surprise.

1:20:33.785 --> 1:20:35.569
- Harry?

1:20:37.528 --> 1:20:38.921
- Merry Christmas, Betty.

1:20:49.366 --> 1:20:51.847
- Hey, you guys!

1:20:53.631 --> 1:20:54.850
I got karaoke.

1:20:55.502 --> 1:20:56.677
Whoo!
