- [Simone] Greg.
- [Siren Wailing]

00:19.990 --> 00:23.889
- Hey. What do we got?
- Ah. Little girl went off the roof.

00:23.963 --> 00:26.332
Uh, I think she hit
the bracket on the way down.

00:26.398 --> 00:29.051
- Got a name on her?
- Yeah. Miriam De Guzman.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.512
- Ah.
- The mother's over here.

00:31.587 --> 00:34.590
- Guess we should let her look at the body.
- Let Andy take a look first.

00:36.936 --> 00:39.524
- [Medavoy Exhales Sharply]
- [Simone] What?

00:39.596 --> 00:43.724
Oh, that- that little girl's, uh-
She's the same age as my Katie.

00:47.347 --> 00:51.028
She's got ligature marks.
There's semen all over her dress.

00:51.095 --> 00:54.928
Bastard raped and strangled
this girl before he tossed her.

00:55.003 --> 00:57.210
[Medavoy]
Andy, I'm gonna take a look upstairs.

00:57.278 --> 00:59.484
- Be back in a few minutes to talk to these people.
- Okay.

00:59.552 --> 01:01.464
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.221
Mrs. De Guzman.

01:05.286 --> 01:07.744
I'm Detective Simone.
I'm with the New York City Police Department.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.116
That's Detective Sipowicz over there.
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

01:11.180 --> 01:14.479
- I want to see her.
- We'll let you see Miriam in just a minute.

01:14.544 --> 01:17.711
We have to ask you
a few questions though.

01:17.780 --> 01:22.803
I sent her to the corner
to get notebook paper for her homework...

01:22.873 --> 01:28.312
and then a few minutes later
all these people were in the street yelling.

01:29.439 --> 01:31.383
I didn't think it was Miriam.

01:31.457 --> 01:33.434
Why would she be on the roof?

01:33.508 --> 01:37.189
When Miriam left the apartment to go to
the store, did you see anybody outside in the hall?

01:37.256 --> 01:39.495
- No.
- [Sipowicz] You didn't hear anything?

01:39.562 --> 01:43.461
- What would I have heard?
- What we're trying to get to,
Mrs. De Guzman- that...

01:43.534 --> 01:46.024
it doesn't look like Miriam's fall
was an accident.

01:46.097 --> 01:50.379
- What?
- We're thinkin' maybe
she was thrown or- or pushed.

01:50.454 --> 01:52.823
You think somebody killed her?

01:52.889 --> 01:54.833
We think it's possible. Yes.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.391
So this person was
in the building...

01:59.935 --> 02:04.545
and to get to the roof he- he took her
by the door of my apartment?

02:04.613 --> 02:08.479
My daughter got carried
past my apartment with me inside?

02:08.553 --> 02:10.889
[Speaking Spanish]

02:10.955 --> 02:13.608
Let me see my daughter.

02:13.678 --> 02:16.048
All right. Come on.
Come on.

02:16.112 --> 02:18.286
[Sobbing]

02:18.355 --> 02:21.391
Andy. I thought you'd want
to talk to this guy.

02:21.463 --> 02:24.597
The guy's got something.
But he'll tell you.

02:24.665 --> 02:26.773
Uh, Greg found something
on top of the stairwell.

02:26.844 --> 02:29.399
We're gonna go take some Polaroids
before we bring it down.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.382
Thanks. Come on.

02:32.545 --> 02:34.719
- What's your name?
- Farr. Phil Farr.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.246
I didn't see nobody.
But I heard somethin'.

02:37.319 --> 02:40.705
- What'd you hear?
- I'm practicing to be a deejay, right?

02:40.779 --> 02:42.755
So I'm in my apartment,
I'm doing my riff...

02:42.828 --> 02:44.936
and I hear the kid scream
goin' down the window.

02:45.007 --> 02:48.043
I mean, she went right by my window.
I got it on tape right here.

02:48.114 --> 02:51.467
[Farr On Tape] Rockin'down and around
with the Farr man. Fast Phil Farr.

02:51.542 --> 02:53.399
- I'll take the-
- [Girl Screams]

02:53.464 --> 02:55.670
Uh-huh?

02:55.738 --> 02:58.643
- How about that?
- We're gonna need this tape.

02:58.717 --> 03:02.496
- H-Wait. That's my property.
- You'll get your property back
when we're done with it.

03:02.561 --> 03:06.209
Come on. That's worth something to me, man.
Some station's gonna pick that up.

03:06.278 --> 03:09.063
Call the 15th Squad about
your tape in a little while.

03:09.128 --> 03:10.985
Look. That's gonna
get me some exposure.

03:11.050 --> 03:13.224
Don't say nothin' more
to me right now.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.204
[Sobbing]

04:23.545 --> 04:25.489
[Martinez]
So, when did this happen, Miss McLeary?

04:25.563 --> 04:27.802
- Last night.
- Last night.

04:27.870 --> 04:31.190
Um- Excuse me one second.

04:31.266 --> 04:32.828
Hey, Diane.

04:32.899 --> 04:35.268
- I'm catchin'. Could you
give me a hand with somethin'?
- Sure.

04:35.334 --> 04:37.955
- Woman says she's been raped.
- What's her name?

04:38.025 --> 04:39.936
Uh, Farrell McLeary.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.845
Miss McLeary, this is
Detective Russell.

04:43.918 --> 04:46.409
- I thought you might be more
comfortable talkin' with her.
- Hi.

04:46.482 --> 04:48.851
Somebody raped me last night.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.440
Why don't we go in here
and talk about it?

04:52.696 --> 04:54.968
Do you mind if Detective Martinez
comes with us?

04:55.035 --> 04:57.525
No.

05:01.249 --> 05:03.673
My name's Diane, Farrell.
Would you like to sit down?

05:03.747 --> 05:05.538
- Mm-mmm.
- [Door Closes]

05:05.606 --> 05:08.096
All right. Why don't you
just tell us what happened.

05:08.168 --> 05:12.264
Last night I went to this bar.
The Ticktock Grill over on East Seventh.

05:13.486 --> 05:17.265
And I met this guy.
He seemed pretty nice.

05:17.330 --> 05:22.191
And we were having some drinks
and getting along, you know. So...

05:22.263 --> 05:24.567
he said that he would
walk me home.

05:24.633 --> 05:28.085
He said his name was
Mark... Drennan.

05:28.158 --> 05:31.095
He said he was a... English teacher...

05:31.168 --> 05:33.243
for some high school uptown.

05:33.315 --> 05:36.766
What time did you
and Mr. Drennan leave this bar?

05:36.838 --> 05:41.545
1000 maybe.
We got to my building, and he-

05:42.573 --> 05:45.096
This guy seemed
like a good guy.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.029
So I asked him if he wanted to
come up and have a drink.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.826
So you asked him up.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.737
And I let him
kiss me some.

05:55.802 --> 05:59.254
And then he started to-

05:59.326 --> 06:02.974
He was pushing his hands
up under my skirt...

06:03.042 --> 06:06.274
and I told him that
I didn't want to do that.

06:06.342 --> 06:09.028
But he wouldn't stop.
And so l-

06:10.057 --> 06:11.914
I tried to
get away from him...

06:11.979 --> 06:14.633
but he pushed me
onto the floor...

06:14.702 --> 06:17.388
and then he-
he got on top of me...

06:17.457 --> 06:19.369
and he-

06:21.429 --> 06:23.602
l- I know
this is hard, Farrell.

06:24.857 --> 06:27.137
You need to be real specific
about what happened.

06:31.238 --> 06:33.891
He entered me.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.193
He- He raped me.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.419
Did he ejaculate?

06:41.488 --> 06:43.345
Yes.

06:43.410 --> 06:47.058
Did you resist, or did you feel
you'd be safer to cooperate?

06:47.126 --> 06:51.091
I tried to scream,
but he kept kissing me so I couldn't.

06:51.162 --> 06:54.297
Do you remember if you
hit him or scratched him?

06:55.872 --> 06:57.914
I don't remember specifically.

06:57.986 --> 06:59.897
Did he hit you?

06:59.972 --> 07:03.292
No. No, he didn't
hit me...

07:04.264 --> 07:06.656
but he raped me.

07:06.731 --> 07:11.110
I have bruises on my hips
where he held me down.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.820
What did you do
after this happened?

07:17.462 --> 07:21.044
I locked myself in the bathroom
till about an hour ago.

07:21.114 --> 07:22.971
Did you bathe or shower?

07:24.414 --> 07:26.969
Took me 12 hours
to get myself out of the bathroom...

07:27.040 --> 07:29.826
- but I knew enough not to do that.
- Well, good.

07:29.891 --> 07:31.868
If it's all right
with you, Farrell...

07:31.942 --> 07:34.562
uh, we'd like to take
Polaroids of the bruises...

07:34.632 --> 07:37.897
and then send you over to St. Vincent's,
have a doctor look at you.

07:40.847 --> 07:42.758
- There you go.
- Thanks.

07:42.832 --> 07:44.689
Mark Drennan.
That's the man's name?

07:44.754 --> 07:47.987
- Yes.
- I'm gonna go run him through B.C.I. All right?

07:49.752 --> 07:51.959
- [Door Opens]
- I am so ashamed.

07:52.923 --> 07:55.829
I asked this man
into my home.

07:55.902 --> 07:59.004
Would you show me the bruises,
and I'll take the pictures?

08:01.893 --> 08:04.613
I'll stand over here
by the door so no one can come in.

08:05.929 --> 08:08.321
Could you come forward a bit?

08:22.138 --> 08:25.786
Medavoy and Lesniak picked up
the D.O.A.'s school book bag and her coat...

08:25.854 --> 08:28.574
at the top of the stairs
along with a man's necktie.

08:28.641 --> 08:32.027
- Looks like that's what he used to strangle her.
- Could the mother I.D. The tie?

08:32.100 --> 08:33.793
- No.
- And no witnesses.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.515
No. Greg and Adrianne-
They talked to the super.

08:36.585 --> 08:40.037
They got the names of everybody in the building.
They're gonna be running them through B.C.I.

08:40.109 --> 08:41.966
Plus we're running
the building through CARS...

08:42.030 --> 08:44.587
to see if it has any kind of
history as a crime scene.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.798
Rapes her, strangles her...

08:46.868 --> 08:48.812
then throws her off
the building.

08:48.886 --> 08:51.507
Ten-year-old girl.

08:51.577 --> 08:55.804
[Russell] Uniform will take you
to the hospital. I'll call you after.

08:59.489 --> 09:03.006
- What's this?
- Woman meets the perfect man.
Turns out to be a creep.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.852
Hey, Diane. I talked to
somebody at Lincoln Park.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.291
This Drennan teaches there,
but he's not in today.

09:09.356 --> 09:12.141
- They gave me his home address.
- Let's go pick him up.

09:12.206 --> 09:14.183
- All right.
- Anything on your little girl?

09:14.257 --> 09:16.715
- Greg found the guy's tie.
- Mmm.

09:16.788 --> 09:19.278
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey. How you doin', Son?

09:19.350 --> 09:21.971
AndyJ. So I hear you'rejoining
the Hackensack force.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.831
Yeah. They accepted me
for trainin'.

09:23.899 --> 09:26.323
- [Simone] Congratulations, man. That's great.
- Thanks a lot.

09:26.398 --> 09:29.598
I just had to come into the city
to get a copy of my birth certificate.

09:29.665 --> 09:31.674
- Paperwork already, huh?
- Yeah.

09:31.747 --> 09:34.717
[Chuckles] Dad, if you're okay doing this
other thing tomorrow...

09:34.790 --> 09:37.444
Mom's flipping a little bit
about me joining up.

09:37.513 --> 09:40.266
I thought I'd cook her pasta tonight,
calm her down.

09:40.332 --> 09:43.084
- Yeah. We can do it tomorrow.
- I don't want to lose the chance with you.

09:43.151 --> 09:45.358
- [Sipowicz] No. Tomorrow's good.
- Come, like, around 4:00?

09:45.426 --> 09:47.665
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll see you then.

09:47.732 --> 09:49.971
- See ya, Bobby.
- Take care, Andy.

09:50.038 --> 09:51.600
Excuse me.

09:55.452 --> 09:58.903
I was gonna take him on the street
after my tour a little bit...

09:58.976 --> 10:00.701
- show him the ropes.
- Yeah, huh?

10:00.769 --> 10:04.221
Hey, guys. Martina Escobar
from up at the 27.

10:04.294 --> 10:06.183
She's working on a case
from last week.

10:06.247 --> 10:10.474
Um, 11-year-old girl raped,
thrown off a roof up at 96th and Second.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.681
- She's gonna bring her stuff down?
- She's on her way.

10:16.434 --> 10:19.569
Martina Escobar.
You ever get a look at her?

10:19.637 --> 10:22.390
- Complete knockout.
- You know her?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.044
- We took a course together.
- I never met her.

10:25.115 --> 10:29.014
Alls I know is she got her first-grade money
the year I got screwed out of mine.

10:33.956 --> 10:35.846
[Chattering]

10:38.217 --> 10:40.074
- Can I help you?
- Mark Drennan?

10:40.139 --> 10:43.940
- Yeah. I'm Mark Drennan.
- We're New York City detectives, Mr. Drennan.

10:44.015 --> 10:46.865
Your, uh, name's come up
in regard to, uh, one of our investigations.

10:46.930 --> 10:50.414
We were wondering if you'd come down to
the precinct so we could ask you a few questions.

10:50.486 --> 10:52.692
Questions about what?
It's okay, Lizzie.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.737
We'll fill you in
down at the station house.

10:54.811 --> 10:57.716
- Am I under arrest?
- We just need to clear up a few things.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.891
- But you're not gonna tell me why you're here.
- [Clears Throat]

11:00.961 --> 11:04.313
- Mark?
- It's nothin'. I got it.

11:04.388 --> 11:06.245
This is a serious matter,
Mr. Drennan.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.287
We were hoping you would
come down like a gentleman...

11:08.361 --> 11:10.730
so we wouldn't have to
put you in handcuffs.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.652
I'd hate to upset
the little girl.

11:12.717 --> 11:16.431
Sweetie, go tell Mommy that I have to talk to
these people for a couple minutes. Okay?

11:18.131 --> 11:21.134
- Mommy, Daddy says he has to-
- All right. Uh, look.

11:21.206 --> 11:24.526
I don't want to go anywhere with you
until you tell me what this is all about.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.775
Someone's bringing a rape charge
against you, Mr. Drennan.

11:26.844 --> 11:29.268
A rape? What?

11:29.343 --> 11:31.679
Would you come with us,
please?

11:31.746 --> 11:33.602
You better get your coat.
All right?

11:34.660 --> 11:36.932
[Sighs]

11:36.999 --> 11:39.904
Phoebe, I gotta go someplace.
I'll be back soon.

12:00.576 --> 12:03.426
- [Simone] Yeah. Any
information you could give us.
- Hi. I'm Detective Escobar.

12:03.491 --> 12:05.019
All right. Thank you.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.784

12:06.854 --> 12:09.027
Hey. Martina.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.953
- How's it goin'?
- It's really nice to see you.

12:11.018 --> 12:14.120
- It's been a while.
- [Simone] I don't want to think about it.

12:14.189 --> 12:15.685
You look good, Bobby.

12:15.759 --> 12:17.900
Andy. Martina Escobar.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.176
We went through the, uh,
C.I.C. Course together...

12:20.244 --> 12:22.898
about, uh, what,
a hundred years ago?

12:22.967 --> 12:25.817
- My partner, Andy Sipowicz.
- Escobar like the drug guy?

12:25.882 --> 12:28.251
He's my uncle.

12:28.316 --> 12:30.424
Comedian.

12:30.495 --> 12:34.492
Case I'm working on-Victim's name
is Rosa Carillo. She's an 11 -year-old kid.

12:34.563 --> 12:37.316
She's in the hospital with multiple fractures.
A clothesline broke her fall.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.272
She get a look at this guy?

12:39.336 --> 12:42.306
As much as we can get, we know it was
a white guy wearing a blue leather jacket.

12:42.379 --> 12:43.842
Blue leather.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.506
That's pretty much all she could see
while it was happening.

12:46.576 --> 12:48.814
We also have this.

12:48.882 --> 12:51.121
[Man On Tape]
This little girl just fell off the roof.

12:51.189 --> 12:54.006
- You gotta send somebody.
- [Woman On Tape] What's your location, sir?

12:54.072 --> 12:56.081
[Man]
You- Man, it's the corner of 96th and Second.

12:56.154 --> 12:58.043
832. The number's
83296th Street.

12:58.108 --> 13:00.347
- [Woman On Tape]
Sir, what's the phone number?
- [Man] You're-

13:00.414 --> 13:02.805
What's the number
you're calling from, sir?

13:02.881 --> 13:05.469
We traced this to a phone booth
half a block down the street.

13:05.539 --> 13:07.614
- Guy seems pretty nervous.
- [Simone] Hmm.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.755
- You wanna trade cases?
- Yeah.

13:11.722 --> 13:13.666
[Escobar]
Here.

13:13.740 --> 13:16.329
We've got a suspect
on that rape complaint.

13:16.399 --> 13:18.856
- Um, Interview 1 's open.
- Who's that?

13:18.929 --> 13:21.420
That is Detective Escobar
from the 27.

13:21.493 --> 13:24.398
- Hey.
- She's workin'on that homicide
with Detective Simone.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.328
She's going through my desk.

13:26.394 --> 13:30.009
Detective, can I get you
any work materials?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.731
- Yeah. I'm looking for a fresh notebook.
- I got one right here.

13:34.049 --> 13:36.156
- There you go.
- Thank you.

13:38.278 --> 13:40.419
Look. I just want to
tell you right off. L-

13:40.488 --> 13:42.629
I really have no idea
what this is about.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.189
Do you know a Farrell McLeary,
Mr. Drennan?

13:45.262 --> 13:47.752
Yeah. I met her last night.
But I didn't rape her.

13:47.824 --> 13:52.084
- Is that what she said? She said I raped her?
- Yeah, Mark. She did.

13:52.149 --> 13:56.594
That's nuts. I met this girl in a bar,
and I ended up going home with her.

13:56.665 --> 13:59.123
- That's all.
- Did you have sexual relations with her?

13:59.196 --> 14:02.909
- Yeah. She wanted to.
- You some kind of ladies' man, Mark?

14:02.976 --> 14:05.729
Hardly. I'm married.

14:05.795 --> 14:08.449
- Which means what?
- Which means I cheated on my wife.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.691
But that doesn't
make me a rapist.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.561
Look. My wife and l-Things have been
kind of a mess between us lately...

14:14.636 --> 14:17.738
and, uh, I don't do
this sort of thing often...

14:17.807 --> 14:20.265
but last night I ended up
going out for a drink, you know.

14:20.338 --> 14:23.887
And I met this girl in a bar.
We started gettin' along, and, um...

14:23.958 --> 14:25.421
things started to get
kind of hot.

14:25.495 --> 14:27.799
What do you mean
kind of hot"?

14:27.866 --> 14:30.104
- You mean you were kissing her, feeling her up?
- Both.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.379
- This is in the bar.
- Yeah. In the bar.

14:32.447 --> 14:34.784
Then she said she had to go,
and would I mind walking her home.

14:34.849 --> 14:37.503
- She asked ya?
- Yeah. She did.

14:37.573 --> 14:40.293
And we end up making out
on the street.

14:40.359 --> 14:43.657
Then she said, uh, do I want to come upstairs.
I mean, I'm not about to say no.

14:43.723 --> 14:47.022
It's been a while since my wife's
been particularly interested.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.570
So we went up to her place,
and- and we made love.

14:50.642 --> 14:53.362
- She was into it.
- Did you use a condom?

14:54.550 --> 14:56.974
No. No, l- I know
that's stupid...

14:57.049 --> 15:00.151
but, uh, we were both
pretty wasted.

15:00.220 --> 15:04.316
According to Miss McLeary, she said
she asked you to stop, and you wouldn't.

15:04.384 --> 15:08.250
Does that ring any bells, or were you
too wasted to remember that too?

15:08.325 --> 15:12.071
At one point she did say,
Maybe we should stop," but she didn't mean it.

15:12.136 --> 15:14.310
Mm-hmm.
You a mind reader too, Mark?

15:14.379 --> 15:18.278
No. She was taking
my shirt off at the time.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.492
So I took that
as an indication.

15:20.562 --> 15:23.729
Look. I'm not into
forcing anybody.

15:25.046 --> 15:26.958
You didn't force her?

15:27.033 --> 15:29.523
- What's this?
- That's what you did to Farrell McLeary.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.452
I didn't do this.

15:31.517 --> 15:34.170
- She must have taken a fall or somethin'.
- Oh, is that right?

15:35.233 --> 15:37.407
No. No, no.
She told me about this.

15:37.475 --> 15:41.254
She takes, um, uh, gymnastics class
at the- at the Y"...

15:41.319 --> 15:44.289
and she told me she banged herself up
working out.

15:44.362 --> 15:48.076
Check it out. Would you, please?
Check it out.

15:48.142 --> 15:50.151
Look, when I left,
she kissed me good night.

15:50.224 --> 15:52.561
This-This-
This isn't a rape.

15:54.710 --> 15:57.363
There you go.

15:57.432 --> 16:00.250
Not too optimistic
I'm gonna get anything from this guy's tie.

16:00.316 --> 16:03.221
They're four for 10 bucks
from every peddler in the city.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.369
[Donna]
Detective Escobar, call for you on line two.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.443
Thanks. Escobar.

16:08.516 --> 16:10.428
Aha.
[Speaking Spanish]

16:10.502 --> 16:12.544
Figures we'll trace where the perp
bought the tie.

16:12.616 --> 16:15.368
She said we had zero on the tie.

16:15.435 --> 16:18.668
[Speaking Spanish]

16:18.735 --> 16:21.738
Puerto Rican Labor Union
is offering a $10,000 reward...

16:21.810 --> 16:24.147
for any information
leading to this perp's arrest.

16:24.212 --> 16:27.445
- Reward, huh?
- Their kids are being attacked. They want to help.

16:27.512 --> 16:29.369
[Sighs]
Anybody really knows what happened...

16:29.434 --> 16:31.291
they know that
we'll pay for information.

16:31.356 --> 16:34.009
Here all we're gonna get
is a bunch of amateur sleuths...

16:34.079 --> 16:36.951
and people lookin' to settle
private grudges.

16:45.162 --> 16:47.019
Sipowicz.

16:47.084 --> 16:49.225
- Calling about the reward?
- Okay.

16:49.294 --> 16:51.151
Can you speak a little
better English there?

16:51.216 --> 16:54.067
- [Escobar] Hold on, please.
- [Sipowicz] Can you give me a description?

16:54.132 --> 16:57.169
- [Phone Ringing]
- On the phone you wouldn't say
why you needed to talk to me.

16:57.239 --> 17:00.504
We just have to ask you a couple of questions
about Farrell McLeary, Miss Keller.

17:00.570 --> 17:02.744
- Do you know her?
- Mm-hmm. She's one of my students.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.670
- Down at the Y"?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.734 --> 17:07.387
- What kind of classes you teach down there?
- Gymnastics-

17:07.458 --> 17:10.756
mat work, uneven parallels-
stuff like that.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.955
- Do people ever get hurt doing that kind of stuff?
- Sometimes.

17:14.023 --> 17:16.230
We're pretty safe
in my class though.

17:16.299 --> 17:20.263
If one of your students did take a fall or
otherwise injure herself in one of your sessions...

17:20.336 --> 17:22.792
- would you be aware of that?
- Not necessarily.

17:22.866 --> 17:26.579
I mean, Farrell could have taken a fall or not.
I don't know. I didn't see it.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.558
I didn't mention
that she had taken a fall.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.931
I assumed that's why
you're talking to me.

17:31.995 --> 17:34.966
Did you speak to Farrell today?
Don't lie. 'Cause we can check.

17:35.039 --> 17:38.720
I wasn't gonna lie.
I did talk to Farrell.

17:38.787 --> 17:42.303
- She called to say she couldn't
make tonight's class.
- She tell you anything else?

17:42.375 --> 17:43.870
Mm-mmm.

17:43.944 --> 17:45.375
[Martinez]
Okay.

17:45.450 --> 17:47.688
All right.
Thanks for coming in.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.667
Sure. My pleasure.

17:52.177 --> 17:54.088
[Russell]
Thank you.

17:54.163 --> 17:57.964
- [Sipowicz] We'll check it out,
and we'll get back to you-
- [Sighs]

17:58.039 --> 18:00.081
I think Miss McLeary
got to her.

18:00.153 --> 18:02.839
- Why would she do that?
- You don't think that woman was lyin'?

18:02.908 --> 18:06.207
I don't know what she was doing,
but that didn't support Drennan's story.

18:06.271 --> 18:08.794
He knew about the gym.
Where's he gonna hear that unless it's from her?

18:08.866 --> 18:12.033
She made up the rape, called her gym teacher,
got her to lie about the bruises.

18:12.102 --> 18:14.690
- Why is she doing all this?
- Maybe she sleeps with him...

18:14.761 --> 18:16.934
finds out he's married,
and now she's pissed off.

18:17.003 --> 18:20.104
So, what are you saying?
You want to give this guy a walk?

18:20.175 --> 18:22.119
Maybe we should
talk to the boss.

18:25.076 --> 18:26.987
You all right?

18:28.022 --> 18:30.129
- What's up?
- I got two possibles.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.979
A lady says some guy tried to drag her kid
into a stairwell, and this one-

18:34.044 --> 18:36.086
The teenager-
He was attacked with a necktie.

18:36.159 --> 18:38.551
- I think we gotta check 'em out.
- Where they at?

18:38.626 --> 18:40.537
Staten Island and the Bronx.

18:40.611 --> 18:43.265
- I'm gonna stay on the phones.
- We'll call in.

18:45.353 --> 18:47.843
You're gonna have to go back to work on this.
Check with the bar.

18:47.915 --> 18:49.542
See if anybody
remembers these two.

18:49.614 --> 18:51.623
I don't want to hold
this guy overnight, Lieu.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.032
[Fancy] If you release him,
can you get him to come back in?

18:54.098 --> 18:56.271
Well, he's a family guy.
He's not goin'anywhere.

18:56.341 --> 18:59.693
Then do it that way. Doesn't sound like
something I can authorize overtime on.

18:59.768 --> 19:02.488
- You're gonna let this guy go?
- [Fancy] Whose case is it?

19:02.555 --> 19:04.826
I'm the one who caught it.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.207
It's his call, Diane.

19:06.207 --> 19:07.156
It's his call, Diane.

19:13.766 --> 19:15.711
I'll go tell this Drennan
he can go home.

19:15.785 --> 19:17.642
Is Bobby around?

19:17.707 --> 19:20.044
Him and Escobar are looking into
some wild goose chase.

19:20.109 --> 19:23.528
- That Escobar any good?
- It don't jump out at ya.

19:23.601 --> 19:25.643
- She messed up my desk.
- [Donna] Line one.

19:26.612 --> 19:28.469
Sipowicz.

19:28.598 --> 19:30.389
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey.

19:30.456 --> 19:32.597
No 'habla"espanol.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.938
- Yeah. Uh, can you speak English?
- Hi, Diane.

19:35.006 --> 19:37.212
- Hi.
- [Sipowicz] English, please.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.704
Martinez, another lead"
on those child murders.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.602
- Sk- Can you?
- [Martinez] Which line is that?

19:41.668 --> 19:44.355
Three. Hold 'ono."

19:44.423 --> 19:46.279
- [Sighs]
- Hi.

19:46.345 --> 19:49.763
Maury asked me to stop by, see how
the investigation was going on the little girl.

19:49.836 --> 19:52.043
I tell you. We're at the crime scene.
Nobody sees nothin'.

19:52.111 --> 19:54.153
Now the Puerto Rican Labor Union
puts out a reward...

19:54.226 --> 19:58.092
everybody and their brother's giving up a name
who's going after these kids.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.055
Yeah. Well, just
keep us posted.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.293
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

20:02.362 --> 20:05.333
- [Donna] Detective, another call.
- Oh. Yeah. Sipowicz.

20:05.406 --> 20:08.922
Diane, we heard that you guys
brought a suspect in on a rape charge.

20:08.993 --> 20:10.850
Uh, we sent him home.

20:10.915 --> 20:13.089
Oh?

20:13.157 --> 20:15.363
The, uh, complainant's bruised,
traumatized.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.288
She's positive for semen
in her rape kit.

20:17.353 --> 20:19.243
The guy admits being with her.

20:19.308 --> 20:22.857
And, uh, James Martinez thinks maybe
the whole thing's a misunderstanding.

20:22.927 --> 20:25.264
Adios.

20:25.330 --> 20:27.438
I've had some personal experience
in this area.

20:27.509 --> 20:31.190
It's not something
that you... misunderstand.

20:31.256 --> 20:33.331
Yeah, well-

20:37.983 --> 20:39.840
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.762
- Hey.
- Phone break, huh?

20:41.827 --> 20:45.092
Yeah. Everyone's lookin'
to give up their mortal enemy.

20:45.159 --> 20:48.676
Yeah? And that date rape-
Uh, I hear you got problems with that.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.604
Yeah. We brought the guy in...

20:50.669 --> 20:53.127
and the thing is, uh,
there's some real questions what went on.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.274
Oh. Yeah. There's always questions
with date rape.

20:55.345 --> 20:57.387
But Diane-
As far as she's concerned...

20:57.459 --> 20:59.371
she just wants to
lock the guy up.

20:59.446 --> 21:02.231
Women detectives get very emotional
with ya, uh, on those cases.

21:02.297 --> 21:06.011
Exactly. And all I'm saying is, uh,
we should look into this a little further...

21:06.077 --> 21:08.446
- and all of a sudden the battle lines are drawn.
- Yeah.

21:11.683 --> 21:13.627
Hi, Sylvia.

21:13.701 --> 21:16.158
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

21:20.332 --> 21:22.538
Anyways, what's the use?

21:23.631 --> 21:25.543
[Sighs]

21:36.060 --> 21:37.917
Now nothin' fits.

21:37.982 --> 21:39.839
[Sighs]

21:39.904 --> 21:41.979
[Toilet Flushes]

21:42.051 --> 21:44.923
Hey. Where do you come down
on that Martinez date rape case?

21:44.997 --> 21:47.520
Yeah. I don't know
too much about that.

21:47.592 --> 21:51.306
Well, I gotta say I was shocked.
Diane Russell told me the facts of the case...

21:51.372 --> 21:54.092
and it seems very clear
that the complainant was sexually coerced.

21:54.159 --> 21:56.398
Yeah. Well,
I'll tell you somethin'.

21:58.997 --> 22:03.158
I got 25 years in. Even when I was drinkin',
I always did my job.

22:03.225 --> 22:05.366
I closed the Bucci kidnapping
two years ago.

22:05.435 --> 22:07.412
I'm up for first grade.

22:07.485 --> 22:10.620
Commissioner decides he's gonna
fill the list with minorities and women.

22:12.611 --> 22:15.680
What does that have to do with
the Martinez date rape case?

22:15.750 --> 22:18.655
I'm just sayin'. We got
a woman detective- Escobar-

22:18.730 --> 22:20.739
workin' a pattern
on these roof murders.

22:20.811 --> 22:23.432
She gets her first-grade money
the same year I'm up.

22:23.502 --> 22:27.215
Fourteen years on the job,
and she didn't close no Bucci case.

22:28.724 --> 22:31.279
[Sighs] I'm gonna have to go to
one of those maternity shops.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.262
[Phone Rings]

22:34.842 --> 22:36.699
Yeah. Hello.

22:36.764 --> 22:39.188
Ah, hell.

22:39.263 --> 22:41.240
Okay. Yeah.

22:41.313 --> 22:43.486
- Damn.
- What?

22:43.555 --> 22:45.827
Another kid
got thrown off a roof.

22:48.136 --> 22:50.888
[Simone] All right, guys.
Can you lift that blanket up, please?

22:52.332 --> 22:54.506
[Shutter Clicks]

22:54.575 --> 22:56.486
[Speaking Spanish]

22:59.604 --> 23:02.323
Okay. Thanks.

23:02.391 --> 23:04.848
- [Siren Wailing]
- You want to step back there?

23:04.921 --> 23:06.898
- All right.
- Would you get these people out of here?

23:06.972 --> 23:09.790
Hey. Little boy.
We haven't I.D.'d him yet.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.930
- Six blocks from the last one.
- Yeah.

23:12.001 --> 23:13.945
Got thrown off of this roof,
landed on the cab.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.356
Some of the neighbors-
They moved him.

23:16.422 --> 23:18.726
- [Sipowicz] Did you talk to these neighbors?
- [Simone] No.

23:19.849 --> 23:21.761
Hey. Hey. Let me ask you-
Hey, hey.

23:21.836 --> 23:23.692
- [Simone] Grab him.
- Hey, hey. I got it, Bob.

23:23.758 --> 23:25.614
- Hey. Where you goin'?
- I didn't see nothin'.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.333
- I just want to talk. What are you nervous about?
- I didn't see anything.

23:28.402 --> 23:30.860
- I'm not nervous.
- Know anything? How about a guy
in a blue leather jacket?

23:30.933 --> 23:33.970
- I didn't see anything.
- Yo, yo, yo, yo. Bro, just calmate, okay?

23:34.041 --> 23:37.110
- I am talkin' to him.
- [Speaking Spanish]

23:37.180 --> 23:40.150
[Spanish]

23:40.222 --> 23:42.134
[Spanish]

23:49.160 --> 23:50.689
You know him?

23:50.762 --> 23:54.410
[Spanish Continues]

23:59.027 --> 24:01.004
The dead boy's name
is Eddie Chavez.

24:01.077 --> 24:03.567
- This kid knows his sister.
- That kid spoke perfect English.

24:03.639 --> 24:05.528
Well, he was
more comfortable in Spanish.

24:05.594 --> 24:08.663
All I'm sayin', in English we both can
question this kid together.

24:08.733 --> 24:10.775
[Escobar]
Yeah, but we needed the information...

24:10.847 --> 24:12.704
and he obviously
was more comfortable in Spanish.

24:12.769 --> 24:14.811
Is that how you got your shield,
Detective Escobar?

24:14.883 --> 24:17.504
- Speakin' Spanish to the brass at city hall?
- Implying what, Detective?

24:17.574 --> 24:19.681
[Spanish]

24:20.713 --> 24:22.625
[Spanish]

24:22.700 --> 24:25.420
Oh, I'm sorry.
Should I be talking to them in English?

24:25.486 --> 24:27.910
You shouldn't be talking
to them at all.

24:35.609 --> 24:37.847
- We're not open yet.
- We're from the police department.

24:37.916 --> 24:40.733
- I called yesterday. I said we'd be stoppin' by.
- Oh, yeah.

24:40.799 --> 24:43.256
- You were workin' the bar Monday?
- Yeah.

24:43.329 --> 24:45.633
- You recognize this woman?
- Yeah. She was here.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.906
She come in with any friends?

24:47.974 --> 24:50.912
- No. Not usually. Monday she got lucky.
- Meaning?

24:50.985 --> 24:53.737
She met a guy, he was buying her some drinks,
and they were mugging it up.

24:53.804 --> 24:55.749
- They were kissing and such?
- Yeah. These two were in heat.

24:55.822 --> 24:57.580
I was gonna tell 'em
to take it somewheres else...

24:57.648 --> 24:59.985
- but they figured that out on their own.
- Hi.

25:00.050 --> 25:02.671
This guy who picked her up-
Did you ever see him before?

25:02.742 --> 25:06.455
- No. She's a regular though.
- She pick up a lot of guys?

25:06.521 --> 25:09.110
No, but when she does
she means business.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.354
I mean,
she's an attractive woman...

25:11.422 --> 25:14.687
but I think she's one of these babes
that hears the clock ticking.

25:14.754 --> 25:17.342
Thanks for your opinion.
[Whispers] Asshole.

25:22.314 --> 25:25.034
[Chattering]

25:25.101 --> 25:27.624
We're gonna have to ask
that Miss McLeary some hard questions.

25:27.696 --> 25:30.449
- She was kissing the guy in the bar.
- Yeah. And on the street too.

25:30.515 --> 25:34.064
Oh. In the bar and on the street.
Well, that definitely means he can rape her.

25:34.134 --> 25:37.913
Hey, Diane. When that Miss McLeary first
came in, I found her just as credible as you did...

25:37.978 --> 25:39.835
but now we're gettin'
some conflicting information.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.423
There's a lot of sexual behavior here
that woman didn't tell us about.

25:42.495 --> 25:45.630
Both of us know no jury
convicts that guy off that set of facts.

25:45.699 --> 25:49.118
- Not if you're on it.
- Hey. I'm sorry we disagree on this case, Diane...

25:49.191 --> 25:50.883
but I'm just trying
to do myjob.

25:50.952 --> 25:54.404
If that makes me look insensitive,
I'm willing to live with it.

25:58.928 --> 26:01.451
[Woman Speaking Spanish]

26:05.078 --> 26:06.935
[Spanish]

26:07.000 --> 26:08.825
Okay. Bye, Mami.
[Sniffles]

26:10.108 --> 26:11.965
- [Beeps]
- My mom's going straight to the hospital.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.040
If you want to talk to her,
that's where she'll be.

26:14.113 --> 26:17.662
- Okay.
- What time did your brother
Eddie go to school this morning?

26:17.732 --> 26:20.003
[Woman]
About 800. [Sniffling]

26:20.071 --> 26:22.943
I was worried because he usually
meets his friends on the corner...

26:23.018 --> 26:26.087
so that they can walk together,
and he was late today.

26:26.157 --> 26:28.265
Do you know if he met
the other kids?

26:28.336 --> 26:31.688
He said that if- that if they left
without him he'd come back.

26:31.763 --> 26:34.253
So when he didn't come back,
I thought everything was fine.

26:34.325 --> 26:36.018
Can I get you somethin'?

26:36.087 --> 26:38.064
Glass of water maybe?

26:40.156 --> 26:42.329
[Door Opens]

26:42.398 --> 26:44.823
Bill, somebody killed Eddie.

26:45.858 --> 26:48.544
What? What?

26:48.613 --> 26:51.201
[Woman Sobbing]

26:51.336 --> 26:54.405
- Who are you guys?
- We're the police. Who are you?

26:54.475 --> 26:56.332
This is my boyfriend,
Bill Walsh.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.286
You live here
in this neighborhood, Bill?

26:58.351 --> 27:00.589
- I have a place over on Bowery.
- [Sobbing]

27:00.658 --> 27:03.311
Man. Somebody killed Eddie?

27:08.730 --> 27:10.969
[Escobar]
I found this on the floor in your kitchen.

27:11.036 --> 27:13.854
I think it must have fallen off a chair.
Can I hang this up for you?

27:13.919 --> 27:15.863
It's mine.

27:15.938 --> 27:19.487
- Left your jacket here, huh?
- I just went out for groceries.
Didn't think I needed it.

27:19.557 --> 27:21.861
So you were here this morning,
huh, Bill?

27:21.928 --> 27:24.418
Yeah. I just fed Eddie breakfast.
How could this happen?

27:24.490 --> 27:29.197
Did you see him on the street? You know,
maybe passed him on the way to the grocery store.

27:29.263 --> 27:32.430
No, no. The store's in the other direction
from where he walks.

27:32.499 --> 27:35.731
Couldn't we do this later? I have to go
and see my mom at the hospital.

27:35.798 --> 27:37.655
- Absolutely.
- [Bill] I'll drive you, hon.

27:37.720 --> 27:41.040
[Simone] Uh, maybe you can come to
the station house with us, Mr. Walsh.

27:41.116 --> 27:43.802
- Me?
- Yeah. It'd be a really big help.

27:43.870 --> 27:47.103
A case like this, there's so little goin',
anything you can give us would be significant.

27:47.170 --> 27:50.108
- I better stay with Lydia.
- Stuff you might forget in a couple hours...

27:50.181 --> 27:52.550
could make the difference.

27:52.616 --> 27:54.560
It's okay. Go with them.

27:55.659 --> 27:58.149
Here. You don't wanna
forget your jacket.

28:11.868 --> 28:13.780
[Russell]
James, Miss McLeary's here.

28:13.854 --> 28:16.311
- I'll do it.
- I'm not asking you to do it.

28:16.384 --> 28:18.329
It'll be better
comin' from me.

28:20.261 --> 28:22.751
- Farrell, thanks for comin' back in.
- Sure.

28:25.194 --> 28:28.514
Hi.

28:28.590 --> 28:31.976
- Did you arrest him?
- Hmm. We brought Mr. Drennan in
and questioned him.

28:32.050 --> 28:34.419
His story: You both were engaging
in sexual behavior-

28:34.484 --> 28:37.487
in the bar and on the street-
before you invited him up.

28:37.559 --> 28:39.503
We were making out.
I told you that.

28:39.577 --> 28:42.996
His feeling is you definitely indicated
you wanted to have sex.

28:43.069 --> 28:46.204
The bartender supported
Mr. Drennan's version of events.

28:46.273 --> 28:50.368
What do you mean the bartender supported it?
The bartender wasn't there.

28:50.436 --> 28:52.413
In addition,
Mr. Drennan told us...

28:52.487 --> 28:55.556
that you had told him
you got those bruises working out at your gym.

28:55.626 --> 28:58.761
So, we spoke to your instructor,
Gail Keller.

28:58.829 --> 29:00.686
She wouldn't confirm or deny
that story.

29:00.751 --> 29:03.055
Then she admitted she spoke to you
before we asked her to come in.

29:03.122 --> 29:04.650
So?

29:06.421 --> 29:08.278
Did you ask her
not to lie exactly...

29:08.343 --> 29:12.341
but just not to tell us
that you did hurt yourself working out?

29:12.412 --> 29:14.716
She said you work out
on uneven parallel bars.

29:14.782 --> 29:16.956
- Could that be how you got those bruises?
- She heard my question.

29:17.025 --> 29:18.620
He raped me.

29:18.691 --> 29:21.760
Farrell, we're just trying
to get you to understand...

29:21.830 --> 29:24.735
the difficulties of making an arrest
under these circumstances.

29:24.809 --> 29:27.201
[Farrell]
What kind of world is this?

29:27.275 --> 29:30.891
You invite a man into your apartment,
everyone assumes it must be for sex?

29:30.959 --> 29:32.816
I didn't want sex.

29:32.881 --> 29:35.372
I wanted a relationship.

29:35.444 --> 29:37.617
Are you saying
I should drop the charges?

29:37.686 --> 29:42.513
We're trying to let you know
there's a pretty big downside:

29:42.587 --> 29:44.499
The likelihood of
the D.A. Filing.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.780
Oh.

29:46.848 --> 29:49.022
So now I know the downside.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.403
I'll think about
dropping the charges.

30:00.623 --> 30:02.796
[Door Opens]

30:02.864 --> 30:04.721
[Door Closes]

30:04.786 --> 30:07.823
[Man On Tape]
You- Man, it's the corner of 96th and Second. 832.

30:07.894 --> 30:10.286
- The number's 83296th Street.
- [Tape Player Clicks]

30:10.361 --> 30:12.851
- It's him.
- So you got the tape and the jacket.

30:12.923 --> 30:15.347
That's not enough to hold him
ifhe gets nervous.

30:15.422 --> 30:18.774
We're gonna get a Polaroid, see if
her complainant in the hospital can I.D. Him.

30:18.849 --> 30:21.700
- What are the chances on that?
- Crapshoot.

30:21.765 --> 30:25.249
She's got a skull fracture, a concussion.
She could barely talk last time I saw her.

30:25.320 --> 30:29.219
But we gotta try.
We gotta get something to go at this guy with.

30:29.293 --> 30:32.908
- Keep him occupied till
we get back from the hospital?
- Yeah.

30:38.134 --> 30:40.984
How long is this gonna take?
I'm really worried about Lydia.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.960
Well, it's hard to say,
Mr. Walsh.

30:44.348 --> 30:46.238
- What was that for?
- Oh, the boss-

30:46.302 --> 30:48.475
He makes us do this
every time we talk to somebody.

30:48.545 --> 30:51.395
Interview situations. Everybody's always
screaming about police brutality.

30:51.459 --> 30:53.371
Doesn't make any sense.

30:53.446 --> 30:55.717
It's the way of the world.
Come here.

31:06.099 --> 31:08.011
What's the delay?

31:08.085 --> 31:10.641
Those other cops back yet?

31:10.712 --> 31:13.136
[Clears Throat]
Sit down.

31:13.210 --> 31:15.067
We're not gonna wait for them.
[Clears Throat]

31:15.132 --> 31:18.452
- I just had to make a phone call.
- 'Cause I'm tired of sittin' here.

31:18.528 --> 31:21.646
- Whatever information you need,
ask me, and I'm gonna go.
- We're gonna get started now.

31:21.774 --> 31:24.777
What do you want to know? I fed Eddie breakfast,
and I went out for groceries.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.707
Just if you could give me
some background.

31:26.772 --> 31:29.043
Your length of relationship
with his sister, so forth.

31:29.110 --> 31:32.725
- Two and a half years. What's
that got to do with anything?
- Who were you seeing before?

31:32.794 --> 31:36.059
I was playing the field. What the hell's
that got to do with the price of eggs?

31:36.126 --> 31:37.982
- [Chuckles] This was in New York?
- Yeah.

31:38.048 --> 31:40.090
When'd you live in California?

31:41.507 --> 31:43.418
I lived in Walnut Creek.
It's outside Oakland.

31:43.493 --> 31:46.147
- Yeah. How long ago?
- Oh, like, four years.

31:46.216 --> 31:50.213
And, uh, you took a collar there?
Exposing yourself to a minor child?

31:51.245 --> 31:53.834
That was a complete
false accusation.

31:53.904 --> 31:55.312
Sit down.

31:55.377 --> 31:58.380
I ran you with my good friends
at the F.B.I., Bill.

31:58.452 --> 32:00.724
You're clean with us,
but you were wrong with them.

32:00.791 --> 32:03.063
That incident was a kid
with a sick mind.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.271
Is that before or after
you were done with her?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.611
That's it.
I'm outta here.

32:07.679 --> 32:10.234
Yeah. You got
a good case, Bill.

32:10.305 --> 32:12.162
You want to try
and get past me?

32:13.284 --> 32:15.196
You gonna hit me?

32:15.271 --> 32:17.215
[Siren Wailing In Distance]

32:17.289 --> 32:20.259
How about that Polaroid they took of me?
If I come out bruised-

32:20.332 --> 32:22.571
Bill, I'll beat you
till you'll never walk right again...

32:22.638 --> 32:24.615
and you won't have
a bruise on your body.

32:24.689 --> 32:27.474
Help! Somebody help me
in here!

32:27.539 --> 32:29.909
Shh, shh. Billy.
Hey. Shh.

32:29.974 --> 32:31.831
Nobody can hear ya.

32:31.896 --> 32:36.538
See, uh, cops got special feelings
for child killers.

32:36.605 --> 32:39.423
The other fellas
in the station house-

32:39.488 --> 32:42.525
They thought I should spend
some time with you alone.

32:46.215 --> 32:48.356
What are you crying for,
you little turd, huh?

32:48.425 --> 32:51.690
- Have I laid a hand on you?
- Just leave me the hell alone.

32:52.717 --> 32:55.141
- Are you scared? Hmm?
- Yeah. All right?

32:55.216 --> 32:57.640
All right? Does that make you
feel like a big man?

32:57.715 --> 32:59.725
Do you think those kids
were scared, huh?

32:59.797 --> 33:02.767
Do you feel like
a big man with those kids-

33:02.840 --> 33:05.975
raping, murdering them
and throwin' 'em off the roof?

33:06.044 --> 33:08.315
No. No.
I didn't hurt anybody.

33:08.382 --> 33:13.057
The first girl that we know about you hurting-
She's alive. Okay, Bill? Hmm?

33:13.123 --> 33:16.356
She hit a clothesline
going down, and she's alive...

33:16.423 --> 33:19.044
and she said that she can identify
who tried to kill her.

33:19.113 --> 33:20.903
Well, if she says it was me,
it's a setup.

33:20.972 --> 33:24.838
So we got her picking you out, plus we know
that you were with that boy this morning.

33:24.912 --> 33:27.631
- No.
- And this is before your D.N.A.
Goes under the microscope...

33:27.699 --> 33:31.051
from the semen you left on that poor girl
you threw off yesterday.

33:31.126 --> 33:33.846
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I don't give permission for any D.N.A. Test.

33:33.913 --> 33:37.332
Bill, does that mean that instead of
you letting your blood get drawn-

33:37.405 --> 33:39.262
- Oh.
- I have to beat enough out of you...

33:39.327 --> 33:41.664
- to spoon it up from the floor, huh?
- [Whimpers]

33:41.729 --> 33:44.579
[Groaning]
Gonna piss myself.

33:44.645 --> 33:46.687
You hold it!
You hold it!

33:59.156 --> 34:01.679
All right.
You listen to me now.

34:01.751 --> 34:04.274
You dialed 911
on that first girl.

34:04.345 --> 34:07.927
We got you on tape.
Now, that shows remorse...

34:07.997 --> 34:10.103
and you fighting
what's goin' on inside of you.

34:10.175 --> 34:13.440
Now, that's what
you gotta work on now.

34:13.505 --> 34:15.876
I'm lookin' for that
decent part in you...

34:15.940 --> 34:20.069
to come out and explain
how you wound up doing this.

34:20.138 --> 34:23.043
You got four years since
your previous offense.

34:23.117 --> 34:24.973
You were livin'
with an adult woman.

34:25.039 --> 34:27.757
That's someone lookin'
to control himself.

34:29.779 --> 34:31.668
The child had an accident.

34:31.734 --> 34:34.158
She fell off the roof,
and I tried to save her.

34:34.232 --> 34:36.406
- I called for an ambulance.
- This was the first girl?

34:36.475 --> 34:39.641
Yes. That was the first incident
since Walnut Creek.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.884
And what were you doin'
on the roof with her?

34:41.953 --> 34:43.645
We were up there talking.

34:43.714 --> 34:46.652
Don't tell me you were up there talkin',
or you're gonna get hit.

34:46.725 --> 34:49.543
There was some minor
sexual contact.

34:49.608 --> 34:51.465
With-

34:51.530 --> 34:54.184
Then she got afraid,
and she ran and she fell.

34:55.246 --> 34:57.103
I was sick it had happened.

34:57.169 --> 35:00.303
I was living with
an adult woman.

35:00.372 --> 35:02.284
I was workin' my program...

35:03.351 --> 35:06.933
and an accident happened,
and she fell.

35:07.002 --> 35:09.875
You raped her,
but you didn't try to kill her.

35:09.950 --> 35:12.473
I figured the hell with it.

35:12.545 --> 35:15.515
- That's why I did the other one.
- And this would be Miriam?

35:15.588 --> 35:18.111
I figured the hell with it.
No one's gonna believe me anyway...

35:18.182 --> 35:20.039
that the first one
was accidental.

35:20.104 --> 35:24.299
I figured I'd do another one.
To hell with my program.

35:26.031 --> 35:29.132
- And what about Eddie?
- There was no sexual component with Eddie.

35:31.028 --> 35:33.397
He just knew.

35:33.462 --> 35:36.116
I could tell.

35:36.185 --> 35:38.741
When I gave him his cereal,
he looked at me.

35:41.535 --> 35:43.447
And he knew.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.086
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

35:50.152 --> 35:53.451
Some detectives are working a rape case-
a male and a female.

35:53.516 --> 35:55.590
Could I talk to them?

35:55.661 --> 35:57.769
Detective Russell.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.690
There's someone here
about that rape complaint.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.817
I'm Detective Russell.

36:04.888 --> 36:07.858
You were down at the Ticktock Grill
this morning asking about some guy.

36:07.931 --> 36:10.454
Was his name Mark Drennan?

36:10.526 --> 36:12.568
Come on in.

36:14.529 --> 36:16.899
Uh, have a seat here.

36:19.783 --> 36:22.753
- What's your name?
- Ellen Lippert.

36:22.826 --> 36:25.512
- I'm a bartender down there.
- And you know this Mark Drennan.

36:25.581 --> 36:27.274
Did he rape that girl?

36:27.343 --> 36:31.122
- Why are you here?
- 'Cause he raped me too.

36:33.814 --> 36:35.889
Have a seat, Ellen.

36:39.356 --> 36:42.972
[Sighs] When we, uh, talked to
this other bartender, he said he...

36:43.040 --> 36:46.786
- never saw this Drennan before.
- We work opposite shifts.

36:48.454 --> 36:50.595
Drennan came in
about a month ago...

36:50.664 --> 36:52.608
sits at the bar,
starts flirtin' with me.

36:52.682 --> 36:55.335
Having problems with his wife.
He seemed decent.

36:55.404 --> 36:58.025
I let him stay late,
help me clean up the bar.

36:58.095 --> 37:00.618
Then when everyone's gone,
he won't take no for an answer.

37:00.690 --> 37:03.760
He thought he was
some big Romeo.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.866
He actually kissed me
good night when he was through.

37:06.937 --> 37:10.038
I swear the way this jerk is acting
he's got no idea what he did.

37:10.109 --> 37:13.461
Did you, uh, tell anybody
about this at the time?

37:13.536 --> 37:15.927
I told my sister. She said
I should report it, but...

37:16.002 --> 37:19.039
I just felt like this wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't been so stupid.

37:20.423 --> 37:22.335
Would you be willing
to press charges now?

37:22.409 --> 37:24.745
Yeah. That's why I'm here.

37:29.296 --> 37:32.747
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Could, uh-

37:32.819 --> 37:35.725
Stop taking those reward calls, Medavoy.
This guy gave it up.

37:35.799 --> 37:38.257
Thanks. We got him.

37:38.330 --> 37:40.405
He confessed?
That guy, Walsh?

37:40.476 --> 37:43.512
- All three kids.
- That's great, Andy.

37:43.584 --> 37:47.068
- What's up?
- Andy got that guy Walsh to give it up.

37:47.139 --> 37:49.246
You went ahead
and talked to him?

37:49.317 --> 37:52.703
- He was gettin' hinky. Your victim pick him out?
- Yeah. She did.

37:53.866 --> 37:55.722
So that's great.

37:58.511 --> 38:01.132
What would you have done
if this guy would have hollered lawyer"...

38:01.201 --> 38:05.199
- while you leaned on him before
you had a photo I.D. To go with?
- I'm hard of hearin'.

38:05.270 --> 38:09.049
Anyways, now we got the statement
and the I.D. So-

38:09.114 --> 38:10.905
Yeah. Congratulations.

38:14.143 --> 38:17.463
- Hi. Detective Martinez called.
- Wait here.

38:17.539 --> 38:19.930
Yeah. Mr. Drennan.
Thanks for comin' back in.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.726
- Sure. No problem.
- Wanna take a walk over here?

38:35.157 --> 38:37.232
- It was great to see you, Bobby.
- Likewise.

38:37.304 --> 38:40.471
When I, uh, heard about
your wife...

38:40.539 --> 38:42.484
I wanted to call.

38:42.557 --> 38:44.414
I didn't know what to say.

38:44.479 --> 38:46.336
Yeah, well-

38:48.131 --> 38:49.988
Want to go
to dinner sometime?

38:50.054 --> 38:52.030
I'm seeing somebody, Martina.

38:52.103 --> 38:54.954
Ah. Ah. Well-
Missed my chance.

39:00.144 --> 39:02.285
I gotta talk to
your partner.

39:02.354 --> 39:04.461
Yeah. Okay.
I'll see you later, huh?

39:04.532 --> 39:06.706
[Coins Clinking]

39:11.259 --> 39:13.498
Feel pretty good
about getting your statement?

39:13.566 --> 39:15.455
Say your piece, Escobar.
I gotta meet my kid.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.004
- You're a dinosaur, Sipowicz.
- I'm a dinosaur?

39:19.076 --> 39:22.308
You jeopardized that collar
because it sticks in your throat I'm first grade.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.581
It sticks in my throat
how you got it.

39:24.650 --> 39:26.954
Every white guy in the department
with second grade...

39:27.020 --> 39:28.877
thinks he should've gotten
my grade promotion.

39:28.942 --> 39:32.492
Half you guys think I got it on my back.
It doesn't occur to any one of you...

39:32.562 --> 39:35.499
- that I got it because I am good at what I do.
- So you earned it?

39:35.573 --> 39:37.779
- That's right.
- Ah. I got twice your time on the job...

39:37.848 --> 39:40.982
I'm a hell of a detective,
and I paid my dues.

39:41.050 --> 39:43.770
- I earned it.
- Well, life is rough, huh, Sipowicz?

39:43.837 --> 39:46.109
For once a white guy
didn't get something he deserved.

39:46.176 --> 39:49.725
You know, that never happens to Latinos,
and that never happens to women.

39:54.024 --> 39:56.580
[Typing]

40:05.236 --> 40:08.753
- You need to take a look at these?
- I'm not sure. Not right now.

40:11.579 --> 40:15.128
So this, uh, Drennan guy
still says he's innocent, huh?

40:15.198 --> 40:18.682
Those women were lookin' to have sex.
That's all he knows.

40:18.754 --> 40:22.533
Plus he's having problems with his wife.
This is a big relevant point with this jerk.

40:22.598 --> 40:25.569
- Unbelievable.
- [Martinez] We were lucky
the second woman came along.

40:25.642 --> 40:28.842
This guy is pretty convincing.
I mean, I was convinced.

40:28.909 --> 40:32.229
[Chuckles]
Diane was always pretty skeptical.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.795
- How about that second woman showin' up?
- Just great.

40:34.867 --> 40:38.286
- [Fancy] Yeah.
- Not to say it's only rape if the guy does it twice.

40:38.359 --> 40:39.854
Uh, no. No.

40:39.928 --> 40:42.069
It's- It's just hard.

40:42.138 --> 40:46.299
You know, a- a case this confusing,
uh, objectively to- to evaluate the facts.

40:46.367 --> 40:47.678
[Fancy]
Yeah.

40:47.745 --> 40:50.617
I mean, hard for everybody.
Men and women.

40:50.691 --> 40:51.838
Oh, sure.

40:53.190 --> 40:56.008
[Medavoy Sighs]
Anyways-

40:56.073 --> 40:58.826
Lieutenant. Just want to let you know
if you need somebody...

40:58.892 --> 41:01.863
to stay late and answer the phones
I'm available esta noche.

41:01.935 --> 41:04.272
No. We took care of
that case already, John. Thank you.

41:04.338 --> 41:05.802
[John]
Oh, that's great.

41:05.876 --> 41:06.891
[Fancy]
So, um-

41:06.965 --> 41:10.034
- Good night.
- Good night, Lieu.

41:10.105 --> 41:11.535
- Night, Lieu.
- [Lesniak] Night.

41:18.081 --> 41:19.937
Night.

41:29.901 --> 41:32.008
[Chattering]

41:32.079 --> 41:34.602
I just got called
a prehistoric creature today...

41:34.674 --> 41:37.579
so maybe you gotta take
what I say with a grain of salt.

41:37.653 --> 41:41.334
I want to learn from you, Pop.
I feel lucky to be out here.

41:43.451 --> 41:46.651
See those three guys across the street
from us on the corner?

41:46.719 --> 41:49.110
- [Andy] The black guys?
- [Sipowicz] Those three are bad guys.

41:49.185 --> 41:52.571
Those guys decide in a heartbeat
whether to mug or hurt somebody, huh?

41:52.645 --> 41:55.518
- Here you go, fellas.
- [Sipowicz] You see
the people walkin'around 'em?

41:55.592 --> 41:58.082
- [Andy] Yeah.
- Those are black working people.

41:58.155 --> 42:00.613
Now. Hey. I'm not talking
about color here.

42:00.686 --> 42:04.170
I'm saying them three are bad,
and right now they own that corner.

42:04.241 --> 42:06.632
A good cop's gonna
take that corner back...

42:06.707 --> 42:10.388
so the people walkin' by 'em
don't have to fear for their life.

42:10.455 --> 42:12.279
How do I do that?

42:13.307 --> 42:15.218
You say, Look.

42:15.293 --> 42:17.946
We need to
have this corner clear...

42:18.016 --> 42:20.571
so I'm gonna ask you
like gentlemen to move on.

42:20.642 --> 42:23.034
I come back
in 15 minutes...

42:23.109 --> 42:24.998
I don't want to
see you here, all right?"

42:25.063 --> 42:27.138
And then you leave.
You give 'em an hour.

42:27.209 --> 42:28.487
Okay.

42:30.444 --> 42:33.065
Now, you come back in 15 minutes
and they're still there...

42:33.135 --> 42:35.047
what do you do now?

42:37.044 --> 42:38.900
I move 'em, I guess.

42:38.966 --> 42:42.352
You go up to the biggest guy in the bunch,
or the guy with the biggest mouth...

42:42.425 --> 42:45.745
and you say, You don't get off this corner,
I'm gonna lock you up."

42:45.821 --> 42:48.922
And if he doesn't move,
then you put your hands on him.

42:48.992 --> 42:53.306
If he puts his hands back up at you,
you don't fool around.

42:53.381 --> 42:56.133
You find out right away
how good you are with a nightstick...

42:56.200 --> 42:58.056
and how tough
they really are.

42:58.122 --> 43:00.196
'Cause as a cop you can't
afford to lose a fight.

43:00.268 --> 43:02.125
You lose a fight,
you lose your life.

43:02.190 --> 43:03.599
Okay. Yeah.

43:05.361 --> 43:07.753
Okay.

43:10.390 --> 43:13.263
Wanna go take these guys
with me?

43:13.337 --> 43:15.347
Really?

43:16.797 --> 43:21.057
Nah. I don't want to spend
the next six hours doin' paperwork.

43:21.122 --> 43:22.978
I'll call a radio car.

43:24.357 --> 43:27.808
I really appreciate you taking the time
like this, Pop.

43:27.881 --> 43:30.634
This is a good job
for people like us.

43:30.700 --> 43:35.047
We don't have a lot of education,
but we can read and write, and we're honest.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.162
Don't ever embarrass this job.

43:37.235 --> 43:39.693
- I won't.
- I know you won't.
