00:03.273 --> 00:05.273
Previously on Broadchurch...

00:09.993 --> 00:12.433
You have to change all of this.
I can't.

00:12.473 --> 00:14.473
If you don't, you'll end up dead.

00:14.513 --> 00:17.753
If you or your family need to speak,
you call me.

00:18.153 --> 00:19.513
He was put in a boat.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.993
Mark, do you own a boat?
Yeah.

00:21.033 --> 00:23.953
Do you know what it would do that
family, to this town if it was Mark?

00:23.993 --> 00:25.993
What are you looking for?
Blood.

00:26.033 --> 00:29.193
Don't look for the person who killed
him because it won't help.

00:29.233 --> 00:31.433
Cos it will only make you upset.

00:31.473 --> 00:33.713
Because you know the person
who killed him well.

00:33.753 --> 00:36.193
Did you kill Danny?
You think I could kill my own son?

00:36.233 --> 00:39.113
What if Danny found out about
Mark and Becca Fisher?

00:39.153 --> 00:42.713
Father kills his own son to keep him
quiet? You think that's impossible?

00:42.753 --> 00:44.193
I don't know.

00:46.193 --> 00:49.673
One of the night-boats radioed in.
No sign of anyone on it.

00:49.713 --> 00:52.433
Who do we call? Harbour master?
Coastguard?

00:53.753 --> 00:55.913
I need people out there collecting
every piece.

00:55.953 --> 00:58.193
The tide's coming in.
It will wash up soon enough.

00:58.233 --> 01:00.233
No! Get it done!

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

01:27.673 --> 01:29.673
Hello?

01:30.753 --> 01:33.393
You had Mark in most of the day.
Just routine.

01:34.353 --> 01:37.353
Is he a suspect?
Oh, Beth, it's 4:30 in the morning.

01:37.393 --> 01:41.673
No, I have to know. Have you ruled
him out for definite? At least tell
me that.

01:42.433 --> 01:45.113
Beth, please, it's not as simple as
that. Of course it is.

01:45.153 --> 01:47.153
Do you think he killed Danny?

01:49.833 --> 01:53.153
There were gaps in his movements and
we really needed him to explain them

01:53.193 --> 01:54.833
and he wasn't willing to do that.

01:54.873 --> 01:56.873
Where was he?

01:58.033 --> 01:59.713
You need to ask him.
Just tell me.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.553
Beth...

02:02.433 --> 02:04.433
I saw him tonight with Becca Fisher.

02:07.433 --> 02:09.433
Does he know you saw him?

02:09.793 --> 02:12.033
You need to tell him. You need to
talk to him.

02:12.073 --> 02:15.273
I can't do it, Ell.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.633
Really I am.

02:20.513 --> 02:22.513
Who's that?

02:24.033 --> 02:27.913
Is that Paul?
How long's he been standing there?

02:40.993 --> 02:42.233
Morning.
Morning.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.406
Morning, Oliver. Don't normally see
you this early. Been in all night?

02:45.446 --> 02:47.726
Yeah, almost. Sort of.
You all right?

02:47.766 --> 02:51.926
No. Look, I've been doing some
digging on someone and I found
something.

02:51.966 --> 02:53.966
Well, show me.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.166
Do the police know about this?

03:06.926 --> 03:10.326
It can't be Mark Latimer's boat.
That's still with our forensics.

03:11.846 --> 03:13.446
Is this it?

03:13.486 --> 03:15.646
On earth we say,
'Good morning, how you doing?'

03:15.686 --> 03:19.086
I've told him. Makes no difference.
Connected to the Latimer death?

03:19.126 --> 03:21.966
Traces of accelerant suggest the
boat was doused in petrol.

03:22.006 --> 03:25.606
I'm finding flecks of glass and
fibres of cloth within the wood.

03:25.646 --> 03:29.606
If I had to guess I'd say a lit rag
inside a bottle was used to ignite
it.

03:29.966 --> 03:34.446
If someone took the boat out that far
at, what, 4am, to burn it, how did
they get back?

03:34.486 --> 03:37.606
The rear section had marks where
an outboard motor might have gone.

03:37.646 --> 03:39.806
They used that to get back on another
boat.

03:39.846 --> 03:42.846
Or there was more than one of them.
Why burn this boat?

03:42.886 --> 03:44.806
This piece might hold the key.

03:44.846 --> 03:47.686
We sent a sample back for match and
analysis. Look in the grain.

03:51.406 --> 03:53.606
Strands of hair.

03:53.646 --> 03:57.526
Outstanding. Out-bloody-standing!

03:57.566 --> 03:59.326
Oh, Miller, we've got them. Keep
going.

03:59.366 --> 04:01.566
I want to know
as soon as you have confirmation.

04:01.606 --> 04:03.486
Come on, Miller, no hanging around.

04:05.886 --> 04:07.166
That's cheered you up.

04:07.206 --> 04:10.566
100 quid says that's the boat they
used and those hairs belonged to
Danny.

04:10.606 --> 04:13.886
They're panicking, Miller.
Fantastic. That is exactly what we
want.

04:13.926 --> 04:15.926
Starting to show themselves.

04:15.966 --> 04:18.526
And they're an amateur.
Haven't done this before.

04:18.565 --> 04:20.966
That's clumsy - burning the boat
like that and so soon.

04:21.005 --> 04:23.006
That's a big mistake they've made.

04:23.046 --> 04:27.246
That's like oxygen to us. Breathe it
in, Miller, we're getting somewhere.

04:32.526 --> 04:33.726
Hello?

04:33.766 --> 04:36.406
27 unanswered calls and finally she
picks up.

04:36.446 --> 04:38.766
Come on, explain why I shouldn't
sack you.

04:38.806 --> 04:42.726
I've taken leave, that's all. I'm
owed loads and I've got a good story.

04:42.766 --> 04:45.686
I specifically told you not to go.
We're gonna use an agency.

04:45.726 --> 04:49.406
The police are struggling. I don't
think this is gonna be done in a day
or two.

04:49.446 --> 04:51.646
Why do I care? Why will our readers
care?

04:51.686 --> 04:54.646
Model family, two kids. Dad's a
plumber.

04:55.286 --> 04:58.606
Quiet estate, idyllic market town -
definition of normal.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.966
The mum - how photogenic?

05:01.726 --> 05:04.286
Very photogenic. English rose.

05:04.966 --> 05:08.006
Get me an exclusive with her, nice
photo, and I'll look at it.

05:09.766 --> 05:11.566
OK.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.006
Where the hell have you been?
Running. Am I not allowed to run?

05:38.286 --> 05:41.286
I didn't know you were coming.
Just bringing you up to date.

05:41.326 --> 05:45.726
I was just saying we've asked
forensics to examine Danny's
clothing in greater detail.

05:45.766 --> 05:48.326
We're following up on leads
from the house-to-house.

05:48.366 --> 05:50.966
Yeah, now you've stopped messing
around with me.

05:51.006 --> 05:53.046
Don't be a wanker, Mark.

05:54.686 --> 05:58.166
We're holding a public meeting
at the school later today.

05:58.206 --> 06:01.086
Just to keep the town up to date,
answer questions.

06:01.126 --> 06:04.526
You don't have to be there. I'm gonna
go. On behalf of all of us.

06:04.566 --> 06:07.486
You don't have to, Mum.
I want to. Keep busy.

06:07.526 --> 06:10.606
Why is there nothing more in the
paper about Danny?

06:10.646 --> 06:12.926
It's like page 12, couple of
paragraphs.

06:12.966 --> 06:15.486
Don't judge this investigation
by what's in the press.

06:15.526 --> 06:19.246
No, we were saying if there's more in
the papers it might jog people's
memories.

06:19.286 --> 06:22.886
What if there's somebody out there?
They might have seen something.

06:22.926 --> 06:26.446
If we had more in the papers...
Please, let us handle the media.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.486
We have the experience in this.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.726
We're all asking, no offence,
but why's it taking so long?

06:33.766 --> 06:35.046
Trevor, how many...

06:35.086 --> 06:37.966
Multiple complex crime scenes,
particularly at the beach.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.446
Lack of CCTV in key areas.

06:41.486 --> 06:44.966
Er... absence of witnesses seeing
Danny on the night he sneaked out.

06:45.006 --> 06:48.046
We've a lot of information still to
process. We'll get there.

06:48.086 --> 06:51.846
Susan Wright. How many people
do you even have working on it?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.846
I heard you were short staffed.

06:54.886 --> 06:58.446
We have the right resources
for an investigation of this size.
Next question.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.446
I've just come from the pier and
there's...

07:00.486 --> 07:03.086
What did she say her name was?
Susan Wright.

07:03.126 --> 07:05.446
New information came to light
overnight.

07:05.486 --> 07:08.166
And we have to examine it
without contamination.

07:08.206 --> 07:11.766
Is that the boat that was on fire?
My brother saw it when he was out
with his pots.

07:18.126 --> 07:21.486
Erm... It's too early to talk about
specific types of evidence.

07:21.526 --> 07:25.606
You said the tents on the beach
would come down at any moment and
they're still there,

07:25.646 --> 07:27.486
and now you're adding bloody great
vans.

07:27.526 --> 07:29.686
You have to understand
the work going on there.

07:29.726 --> 07:32.166
Every grain of sand has to be gone
through.

07:32.206 --> 07:35.846
Every cigarette butt or stray hair,
shard of plastic,

07:35.886 --> 07:39.246
fingernail, toenail, piece of skin
has to be tested.

07:39.686 --> 07:42.886
We will do everything we can to limit
the effect on your livelihoods,

07:42.926 --> 07:47.366
but my priority is to a thorough
and efficient investigation.

07:47.406 --> 07:50.086
But low-key.
We don't want the name Broadchurch

07:50.126 --> 07:52.526
to be a byword for murder like
Sandbrook.

08:01.646 --> 08:04.286
I told you there was a boat.
God, you're just what I need.

08:04.326 --> 08:07.246
Great. A boat. There's hundreds
round here. You got lucky.

08:07.286 --> 08:09.806
Lucky. Yeah, well, did you look for
it, eh?

08:09.846 --> 08:11.726
Does Beth know you didn't follow that
up?

08:11.766 --> 08:14.166
How about you heed my very strong
advice?

08:14.206 --> 08:16.966
Stay away from her. Do not get
involved.

08:17.766 --> 08:19.366
Right?

08:23.766 --> 08:26.086
Oh! Hey! There he is!

08:30.446 --> 08:32.525
You're Liz, right? Danny's grandma.

08:37.366 --> 08:39.366
You must really miss him.

08:44.206 --> 08:46.206
Oh, he shone, that boy.

08:47.046 --> 08:49.126
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.

08:49.806 --> 08:53.646
I'm the strong one in all this.
I just want them to catch the sod who
did it.

08:56.806 --> 08:58.966
I'm Karen. I work for the Herald.

09:00.646 --> 09:03.446
We're not talking to the press.
No, I know.

09:03.486 --> 09:05.606
But can I just say one thing?

09:06.526 --> 09:10.846
Just be sure you're getting the best
advice. I'd hate for Danny to be
ignored.

09:16.119 --> 09:18.519
Hi.
All right?

09:18.559 --> 09:21.839
You said Mark Latimer didn't fix a
burst pipe at the hut on the cliff.

09:21.879 --> 09:24.199
Yeah.
He did. We checked his paperwork.

09:24.239 --> 09:28.119
He said he got the keys off you and
you even arranged the cheque for him.

09:28.559 --> 09:32.239
Must have got it wrong. Now if you
don't mind, I gotta be somewhere.

09:37.759 --> 09:41.719
The longer this goes on the more
everyone wants to get involved,
stick their oar in.

09:41.759 --> 09:43.759
Develop their pet theory.

09:43.799 --> 09:47.079
People getting restless, too many
opinions. I don't like it.

09:47.119 --> 09:48.399
Here we go again.

09:48.439 --> 09:53.039
Will you pass on to Beth and Mark,
whenever they feel able to talk,
come to us, to me.

09:53.079 --> 09:56.079
They know we do things properly.
I'll make sure they know.

09:56.119 --> 09:58.839
And Oliver has got something else to
tell you.

09:58.879 --> 10:01.199
Well, we always love hearing from
Oliver.

10:01.839 --> 10:05.239
I found this on Jack Marshall,
who runs the newsagent's here.

10:05.279 --> 10:09.999
He was in prison before he came
here. He's got a previous conviction
for underage sex.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.759
Don't try and avoid me.

10:24.959 --> 10:27.159
I know where you live.

10:27.199 --> 10:30.999
I know what your van looks like.
I told you, I don't want to see you.

10:31.439 --> 10:34.079
It's not that simple, though, is it?
It is.

10:34.119 --> 10:36.119
Cos I'm telling you it is.

10:36.919 --> 10:40.279
We're connected now, you and me.

10:41.199 --> 10:43.919
- You can't just turn your back.
- I can.

10:43.959 --> 10:46.359
I don't want you near me.
You may not like it...

10:47.519 --> 10:49.519
but it can't be undone.

10:50.439 --> 10:53.439
So, you and me need to work out
what we're gonna do.

10:53.479 --> 10:55.599
I ain't talking to you.
Do you understand?

10:55.639 --> 10:57.639
You stay away!

11:14.209 --> 11:18.369
A few days ago I told the police
about evidence they should look for.

11:18.409 --> 11:20.649
They took no notice.

11:20.689 --> 11:24.009
Now they've got that evidence, but it
was burned before they got to it.

11:24.049 --> 11:27.169
It makes it harder to analyse it.
Why are you telling me this?

11:27.209 --> 11:29.689
Because I can help. I can help.

11:31.129 --> 11:33.729
But I need to be taken seriously, and
that's...

11:33.769 --> 11:35.769
It's not happening right now.

11:41.289 --> 11:45.089
What if you're wrong? Beth, I've got
no reason to lie to you.

11:46.249 --> 11:48.769
I wish... I wish we'd never had cause
to meet.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.329
But what I have told you is genuine.

11:54.489 --> 11:56.809
And you need to convince the police.

11:58.529 --> 12:02.009
Is this about the postman?
The one who was arguing with Danny?

12:02.049 --> 12:06.009
No, though we did talk to him. He
said he never had an argument with
Danny that day.

12:06.569 --> 12:08.969
Load of rubbish. I know what I saw.

12:10.409 --> 12:13.609
Tell us about your conviction
for sex with a minor, Jack.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.209
So... we're into the muck-raking,
are we?

12:20.889 --> 12:24.329
Just wanna establish the facts.
You didn't mention it when we spoke.

12:25.449 --> 12:27.449
It's nothing to do with anyone.

12:28.329 --> 12:31.609
Nothing to do with Danny.
You help with the Sea Brigade.

12:32.129 --> 12:35.769
That requires CRB checks
cross-referenced
with the Sex Offenders' Register.

12:35.809 --> 12:40.089
I am not a sex offender.
That conviction was a farce.

12:40.129 --> 12:41.529
I'm not on any register.

12:41.569 --> 12:44.569
Only because it happened
before the Register came into being.

12:44.609 --> 12:47.849
Why didn't you tell us about it?
You've got the file, haven't you?

12:48.649 --> 12:51.169
I've served my time.
You should have declared it.

12:51.209 --> 12:53.889
Put up a little sign, should I?
'Ex-convict here'.

12:54.797 --> 12:56.517
I came here to get away from that.

12:56.666 --> 12:58.786
I am not what you're insinuating.

13:00.426 --> 13:02.306
When did you last see Danny Latimer?

13:02.346 --> 13:06.466
I told you, the day before he was
found. He came in, did his paper
round.

13:06.506 --> 13:09.186
What about the night of Danny's
death? Where were you then?

13:10.746 --> 13:13.426
In, on my own, reading a book.

13:13.466 --> 13:16.706
Anyone vouch for that?
Only the book.

13:17.626 --> 13:19.826
Which book?
Jude The Obscure.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.546
You might not like it. Not many
pictures.

13:26.666 --> 13:30.546
We've been told you're a keen
amateur photographer, Jack.

13:32.026 --> 13:34.746
Took a lot of pictures of the boys
in Sea Brigade.

13:35.746 --> 13:37.746
I really do pity you.

13:38.346 --> 13:41.146
Seeing depravity in perfectly normal
behaviour.

13:42.706 --> 13:44.706
I'd hate to be in your mind.

13:46.826 --> 13:51.186
Now, if you've an accusation or
evidence to put to me, let's hear it.

13:51.449 --> 13:54.169
Otherwise, let me go back to work.

13:59.609 --> 14:03.169
Why are we relying on journalists
to do our work for us?

14:03.729 --> 14:05.969
He wasn't a suspect. We haven't
prioritised him.

14:06.009 --> 14:08.209
Well, make him a priority now.

14:24.326 --> 14:25.966
She's here.

14:26.686 --> 14:29.406
Summoned to the inner sanctum.
Should I be worried?

14:29.446 --> 14:31.686
Did you set him off looking into Jack
Marshall?

14:31.726 --> 14:34.566
No, it had nothing to do... Yeah, I
did. I had a run-in with Jack.

14:34.606 --> 14:37.766
Welcome to the club. Still want a
desk?

14:38.846 --> 14:41.806
Definitely. Why would you do that?

14:41.846 --> 14:46.966
Better to have you inside the tent
pissing out, than outside the tent
pissing in, I suppose.

14:47.446 --> 14:49.726
Mine's white. No sugar.
Huh.

15:04.006 --> 15:05.726
Try now.

15:05.766 --> 15:08.806
Yeah. Brilliant.

15:08.846 --> 15:11.366
Thanks, mate. Don't know why I didn't
spot it.

15:11.406 --> 15:13.806
Did you block the sink, Nige?

15:13.846 --> 15:15.646
Why would I do that?
I don't know.

15:17.406 --> 15:19.486
Keep me busy, take my mind off
things.

15:25.766 --> 15:27.766
It's gonna be all right.

15:29.006 --> 15:33.006
I know it'll never be the same,
but... I'll keep the business going.

15:33.686 --> 15:36.286
Whenever you're ready to come back
you just say.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.606
No pressure. Just step back in.

15:42.126 --> 15:44.126
Thanks, mate.

15:44.166 --> 15:47.446
Can I cook for you? This weekend.
Sunday lunch, all of you.

15:48.286 --> 15:50.766
Nah, I don't think so, Nige.
Still got to eat, mate.

15:50.806 --> 15:53.326
You've done it for the rest of us
often enough.

15:53.366 --> 15:56.286
I'm good with beef. You all like
beef?

15:58.086 --> 16:00.526
Yeah, all right.
Come on.

16:15.646 --> 16:17.926
You asked us here for this?
Tell them.

16:23.486 --> 16:26.166
Danny wants people to know
he was killed by someone he knew.

16:26.206 --> 16:30.086
This is offensive. I'm calling a halt
right now. I told you about the boat.

16:30.126 --> 16:32.646
You didn't listen and now you've
found a boat.

16:32.686 --> 16:35.606
I want you to hear him out, please.
Just hear him out.

16:36.566 --> 16:38.566
Tell her.

16:38.846 --> 16:40.486
Beth, we checked Steve's record.

16:40.526 --> 16:43.326
He's bankrupt with previous
convictions for vehicle theft,

16:43.366 --> 16:45.846
petty theft and conspiracy to
defraud.

16:45.886 --> 16:47.086
No.
What?

16:47.126 --> 16:49.686
Right. Out.
No. No, Beth...

16:49.726 --> 16:51.726
Beth, Beth...
Come on!

16:51.766 --> 16:53.926
And you're a bloody idiot for
letting him in.

16:53.966 --> 16:55.966
It's got nothing to do with this.
Beth!

16:56.006 --> 16:59.246
Look, I don't know if you are
mentally ill,

16:59.286 --> 17:02.046
a liar, or somebody who believes
they're telling the truth,

17:02.086 --> 17:04.646
but I have to find this killer
and prove my case in court.

17:04.685 --> 17:07.165
I deal in facts. All you're giving
her is fantasy.

17:09.286 --> 17:13.886
Pete is now gonna escort you to your
vehicle and you are gonna stay away
from this house.

17:13.925 --> 17:17.126
Final warning. I see you again,
I will have you in prison.

17:24.606 --> 17:27.406
Why would he do that?
I haven't given him any money.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.686
In two weeks he'll speak to the
press, in six months he'll write a
book:

17:30.726 --> 17:34.566
How I Solved The Broadchurch Murder.
All those books are in the bookshop
in town.

17:37.886 --> 17:39.886
Oh, my God.

17:44.926 --> 17:47.126
I'm so alone.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.206
Beth, have you spoken to Mark?
I can't.

17:49.246 --> 17:51.246
You've got to.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.486
No, no, no, no!

18:13.966 --> 18:15.526
There you go, love.
Thanks.

18:15.566 --> 18:18.686
Thrill ride round the bay.
Best 15 quid she'll ever spend.

18:18.726 --> 18:21.166
Kids go half-price.

18:21.206 --> 18:23.206
Perfectly safe.

18:23.246 --> 18:26.486
Looks good.
Er... Maggie. I edit the Echo.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.246
Yeah, I know. I saw you at the
meeting.

18:29.286 --> 18:31.566
You're Susan.
Yeah.

18:31.606 --> 18:33.166
Or is it Elaine?

18:35.006 --> 18:39.406
Only I've got a picture of you with
the Sea Brigade boys under a
different name.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.206
Your people must have wrote it down
wrong.

18:43.246 --> 18:46.646
RIB rides! Broadchurch Blaster!

18:47.486 --> 18:49.486
Thrill ride round the bay.

18:56.446 --> 18:58.246
You still coming to dinner?

18:58.286 --> 19:00.926
Joe's going shopping today, so you
can't back out now.

19:00.966 --> 19:03.846
I said, didn't I? What we asking
this vicar?

19:04.326 --> 19:06.526
Er, he was flagged up in the
house-to-house

19:06.566 --> 19:09.886
as one of the few without an alibi on
the night Danny was killed.

19:10.326 --> 19:13.566
Do you know him well? Not really.
Only been here a couple of years.

19:13.606 --> 19:15.486
We're not really churchgoers.

19:15.526 --> 19:17.606
Midnight mass, Easter, if we
remember.

19:18.606 --> 19:22.326
If you remember Easter? We're
normally doing Easter egg hunts.

19:23.126 --> 19:25.126
And so did Christianity fall.

19:26.286 --> 19:28.886
What about you, then? You religious?
Yeah.

19:30.886 --> 19:33.566
I pray nightly you'll stop asking me
questions.

19:35.046 --> 19:37.766
Liz, his grandmother,
she's one of our sidesmen,

19:37.806 --> 19:40.126
and I used to teach the IT club
at Danny's school.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.166
Oh, yeah, Tom did that too.
Yeah.

19:42.206 --> 19:45.526
So you knew Danny quite well.
I wouldn't say really well.

19:46.526 --> 19:49.166
Erm... he was a quick learner. Same as
Tom.

19:49.206 --> 19:51.206
They were good kids, both of them.

19:51.246 --> 19:53.126
Why are you taking the IT club?

19:53.166 --> 19:56.246
I try to connect with the community
whatever way I can.

19:56.286 --> 19:58.286
Plus I got asked to.

19:58.326 --> 20:02.766
I think the last teacher who really
understood computers had a nervous
breakdown.

20:02.806 --> 20:06.086
Mr Broughton. He'd sit there
and laugh to himself. They got him
to
leave.

20:06.126 --> 20:08.846
I'm one up from the man
who sits there giggling to himself.

20:08.886 --> 20:11.606
Where were you on the night of
Danny's death?

20:13.006 --> 20:15.726
I did talk to your uniformed officers
about this.

20:16.526 --> 20:18.526
I know.

20:19.366 --> 20:22.566
I was at home. On my own.

20:23.366 --> 20:27.166
I live in the house at the bottom of
the hill. I was up late trying to
write a sermon.

20:27.206 --> 20:29.886
Trying being the operative word.
Are you often up late?

20:29.926 --> 20:34.006
I was on the verge-side about 4:30
the other night, saw you standing
outside the church.

20:34.046 --> 20:36.046
Was that you?

20:36.486 --> 20:38.366
OK, er...

20:39.966 --> 20:44.046
Yeah... I have terrible insomnia.

20:44.806 --> 20:46.966
I have had for about six or seven
years.

20:47.006 --> 20:52.086
Can't find anything to cure it,
so... I'm often up late, wandering.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.166
That's my best attempt to deal with
it.

20:54.206 --> 20:56.326
Anything specific that triggered it?

20:58.086 --> 21:00.166
Not really. No.

21:00.206 --> 21:02.606
You weren't out wandering that
Thursday night?

21:03.686 --> 21:05.686
No, I don't remember it.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.166
How was Danny with computers?

21:13.166 --> 21:15.806
Great. They just instinctively get
it.

21:17.126 --> 21:21.526
Like I say, with Danny and Tom,
you only have to tell them once and
they got it.

21:27.206 --> 21:30.406
Line of sight. You can see the field
that backs onto the Latimer house.

21:30.446 --> 21:32.446
And my house too.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.606
I hate what I'm becoming.
A good detective?

21:37.246 --> 21:39.246
Hardened.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.958
I'm not here to hassle.

21:45.959 --> 21:48.360
I've been here since day one and I've
left you alone.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.440
It's true. I left one of Danny's
toys at the beach.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.420
She brought it back to me, save it
getting nicked.

21:52.468 --> 21:54.748
But I bumped into Liz at the school
and...

21:55.788 --> 21:59.708
I think this should be getting more
coverage. Yeah, so what shall we do?

21:59.748 --> 22:01.748
OK, you're not gonna like this.

22:02.188 --> 22:06.668
The reason Danny's death isn't
getting proper attention is it's not
the right profile.

22:06.708 --> 22:09.628
Had Danny been a girl with blonde
hair and a few years younger

22:09.668 --> 22:12.308
then this place would be crawling
with reporters by now.

22:12.348 --> 22:15.668
I hope you're kidding.
I'm sorry. It's the way it works.

22:15.708 --> 22:18.628
11-year-old boys
go missing from home all the time.

22:19.148 --> 22:21.348
So we're just gonna get ignored, are
we?

22:21.698 --> 22:25.858
If you want more focus on this case,
then it's gonna have to come from
you, Beth.

22:27.018 --> 22:28.258
Me? Why me?

22:28.298 --> 22:32.218
You tell us your side of things,
how it's been for you, every mum will
respond.

22:32.258 --> 22:34.258
I don't know. Do we want this?

22:35.138 --> 22:37.258
Shouldn't we clear it with the
police?

22:37.298 --> 22:40.578
It's the Herald. I read the Herald.

22:40.618 --> 22:43.538
What if she shows us what she's
written before she sends it in?

22:43.578 --> 22:47.098
Good idea. Would you do that?
Not normally.

22:47.138 --> 22:51.658
Maybe this time if I can get a photo
with Beth and Danny to go with the
article.

22:53.218 --> 22:55.218
What do we think?

23:04.698 --> 23:06.698
OK.
Yeah?

23:20.858 --> 23:24.538
That's it. I want to see this area
covered. Keep going.

23:24.578 --> 23:28.058
Hi, Mr Marshall.
Oliver. Come to help?

23:28.098 --> 23:31.058
Well, could we maybe just talk
inside?

23:31.098 --> 23:34.498
No, we can talk here, can't we? Can't
you see I'm busy? What do you want?

23:34.538 --> 23:38.258
OK, erm... I've come across
some information and...

23:38.538 --> 23:41.938
being as we know each other I
thought I should come to you before
it gets out.

23:41.978 --> 23:43.858
Before what gets out?

23:43.898 --> 23:46.418
I'm sorry, there's no easy way of
asking this.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.778
Do you have a conviction for
underage sex?

23:49.938 --> 23:53.258
Why, you little bastard.
I'm not trying to stitch you up.

23:53.818 --> 23:56.938
Who told you? The police? I can help
you put your story across.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.578
You're all as bad as each other -
gossiping and accusing.

23:59.618 --> 24:01.618
OK, I think you should let go of me.

24:03.618 --> 24:07.098
You've known me how long?
When did I ever do anything improper?

24:07.138 --> 24:08.778
OK, if we could go inside and
talk...

24:08.818 --> 24:10.978
So you can trick me into
incriminating myself?

24:11.018 --> 24:13.698
Is that what that bitch your boss
wants? That's a bit...

24:13.738 --> 24:16.258
How can I incriminate you if you're
innocent?

24:16.298 --> 24:19.498
They've trained you to be a clever
weasel, haven't they?

24:19.738 --> 24:21.978
Go on. Get away. Go!

24:22.018 --> 24:24.258
Weasel! Go! Go!

24:36.458 --> 24:38.638
Oh, you're in a suit.
Is that bad?

24:38.708 --> 24:41.808
No, I didn't expect it. We didn't
get poshed up. Neither did I.

24:42.128 --> 24:44.448
Well, there we are, then. Come in.
I bought wine.

24:44.488 --> 24:46.568
That's very kind of you.
And flowers.

24:46.608 --> 24:49.128
Oh, you didn't need to...
And chocolates.

24:49.168 --> 24:51.168
Wow.

24:51.208 --> 24:53.608
Wasn't sure which to choose so I got
them all.

24:54.048 --> 24:56.048
Bless. Come in.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.248
Thanks.

25:02.288 --> 25:05.128
Alec bought wine and flowers and
chocolates.

25:05.168 --> 25:07.168
Full house - you can come again.

25:07.808 --> 25:10.608
I can call you Alec tonight, not
Hardy or sir?

25:10.648 --> 25:12.768
'Here's your dinner, sir.'

25:12.808 --> 25:15.488
I don't like Alec. I've never liked
Alec.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.848
'Alec.'
You can always choose another one.

25:18.888 --> 25:22.568
Why does everyone use first names so
much, like they all work in
marketing?

25:22.608 --> 25:24.208
Why do people insist on doing that?

25:25.098 --> 25:28.138
I mean, if you look at a person I
look at you...

25:29.658 --> 25:32.858
You know I'm talking to you. I don't
need to say your name three times

25:32.898 --> 25:36.378
to congratulate myself on remembering
it, to create some...

25:36.418 --> 25:39.058
sort of false intimacy or...

25:40.729 --> 25:43.289
Shall I show you to the dining room?

25:52.649 --> 25:54.749
How did you two meet?
Er, through work.

25:54.822 --> 25:57.342
Joe used to be a paramedic.
Not any more?

25:57.382 --> 25:59.382
Gave it up when Fred came along.

25:59.742 --> 26:02.262
I was getting a bit jaded anyway.
Jaded, how?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.862
More red tape.

26:04.902 --> 26:09.022
Stuff that stopped us from being
able to help, masquerading as health
and safety.

26:09.062 --> 26:11.062
Where are you from originally?

26:12.062 --> 26:14.062
Cardiff.

26:14.862 --> 26:17.982
Moved down here 13 years ago for
work.

26:18.022 --> 26:20.382
Met Ellie. The rest is history.

26:22.142 --> 26:25.342
You married? This is great food.
You make this yourself?

26:25.382 --> 26:28.382
Mm. Self-taught. Mexican's my
speciality.

26:28.902 --> 26:31.742
We should really be having
margaritas, shouldn't we?

26:31.782 --> 26:33.782
No.

26:35.102 --> 26:37.102
Not married. Not any more.

26:37.142 --> 26:40.142
Sorry to hear that. What was it?
The pressures of work?

26:40.182 --> 26:42.662
Sort of. This job does it to you.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.342
Not to us.
No, I didn't mean...

26:48.582 --> 26:50.582
Any erm... any kids?

26:54.902 --> 26:58.062
Daughter. 15. Lives with her mother.

26:58.102 --> 27:00.102
Oh, that must be hard.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.502
Do you think you'll solve this case?
Joe.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.542
Certain.

27:17.422 --> 27:19.422
Good.

27:20.102 --> 27:23.342
Right, I'm gonna have a wee.
No more talking about work.

27:27.782 --> 27:29.782
Well, that's us told.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.662
No, no, not for me.
Shut up and drink!

27:46.222 --> 27:48.222
Does she like me?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.662
Sorry?
Does she like...

27:51.942 --> 27:53.942
working with me?

27:53.982 --> 27:55.982
You're here for dinner, aren't you?

27:56.502 --> 27:58.582
I think I irritate her.

27:58.622 --> 28:00.622
She hasn't mentioned it.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.782
You bloody liar.

28:04.822 --> 28:06.822
I've said nothing.
And yet...

28:13.822 --> 28:15.822
What are you laughing about?

28:17.342 --> 28:19.342
Nothing.

28:21.942 --> 28:24.582
Sure you don't want a taxi?
No, no. Walk will be good.

28:24.622 --> 28:26.622
See you in the morning.

28:26.662 --> 28:29.262
That was nice. Thanks, Miller.

28:32.542 --> 28:35.662
A whole evening and it's still
Miller. Unbelievable.

28:35.702 --> 28:38.102
I love you, Miller.
Oh, don't you start.

28:38.142 --> 28:40.742
You and your new bloody little mate.

29:03.902 --> 29:08.142
Lord... give me the strength
to deal with tomorrow.

29:08.982 --> 29:10.982
You are my strength and my shield.

29:11.702 --> 29:15.702
I ask for wisdom and courage
in this darkest of moments.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.382
In the name of Christ the king.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.342
Amen.

30:52.302 --> 30:54.302
Why are you so bothered about me?

30:56.622 --> 30:58.622
What's my life got to do with you?

31:06.142 --> 31:08.142
I think you should leave.

31:09.822 --> 31:13.342
You're gonna stop asking questions
about me.

31:15.182 --> 31:17.182
Why would I do that?

31:20.182 --> 31:22.542
I know men who would rape you.

31:46.542 --> 31:47.782
Night.

31:48.862 --> 31:50.462
Night.

33:00.049 --> 33:02.649
It's OK. We're getting you to
hospital. No, you can't.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.969
It's gonna be OK. You don't need to
worry.

33:13.169 --> 33:16.909
Good morning, sunshine. Took quite a
crack. What am I doing here?

33:16.936 --> 33:18.536
How you feeling?
What are you doing here?

33:18.583 --> 33:21.303
You passed out.
Found you on the bathroom floor.

33:21.343 --> 33:23.343
What were you doing in my bathroom?

33:23.383 --> 33:27.583
The person in the room underneath you
complained about the banging,
luckily.

33:28.863 --> 33:31.623
Is this your daughter?
What you doing with that?

33:31.663 --> 33:35.663
I was looking for your next of kin
in the ambulance. I told them I was
your wife.

33:35.703 --> 33:38.903
What? Is that bad? I think they
caught on pretty quick.

33:39.863 --> 33:44.103
Anyway, look, I am glad you are OK
and awake. I have to get back.

33:44.175 --> 33:46.375
Left Neil in charge, he's not exactly
competent.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.535
Listen. You mustn't tell anyone
about this.

33:48.575 --> 33:51.095
If they find out I'm sick they'll
take me off the case.

33:51.135 --> 33:54.335
I don't want to come off this case.
I need to finish this case.

33:55.866 --> 33:57.306
Becca.

33:57.346 --> 33:59.346
It's my career.

33:59.946 --> 34:02.866
This is my life.
You get some proper medical help.

34:02.906 --> 34:05.186
Cos next time someone might not find
you.

34:05.226 --> 34:08.306
I'm coming with you.
Ah, no, they want to keep you in.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.346
I don't care. What's this?

35:01.466 --> 35:05.906
It's a great piece. You captured Beth
just right. But Maggie's gonna be
miffed.

35:05.946 --> 35:09.906
I'll talk to her. Mark and Beth were
desperate for people to know about
the case.

35:09.946 --> 35:12.266
Think about the witnesses
that might come forward.

35:12.306 --> 35:14.706
So you're the golden girl
on your news desk now?

35:14.746 --> 35:19.506
Well, the boss is officially happy
and the rest of the papers are now
scrambling to catch up.

35:19.546 --> 35:21.866
Half a dozen...
Hang on, I've gotta go.

35:26.186 --> 35:28.906
You've gotta be joking.
Nothing to do with me.

35:31.386 --> 35:33.186
Mum?

35:33.746 --> 35:36.866
Oh, what are you doing with that?
Don't be brave, son.

35:36.906 --> 35:39.626
For God's sake. I thought you said
you'd fixed it.

35:40.506 --> 35:45.106
It's a mix-up. They got it wrong.
Why don't you understand the trouble
we're in?

35:45.986 --> 35:48.186
Why has she done this?
It reads all right to me.

35:48.226 --> 35:50.306
I told 'em not to. I'm gonna have to
go.

35:51.906 --> 35:53.706
See you later.

35:53.746 --> 35:56.946
I was thinking of taking the kids to
church this morning.

35:56.986 --> 35:58.986
Church?
Yeah.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.226
Why?
Don't know.

36:02.186 --> 36:05.746
Just... felt... the thing...

36:07.306 --> 36:09.306
Yeah. OK.

36:10.306 --> 36:12.306
Bye-bye.
Ta-ra, love.

36:13.666 --> 36:16.066
Bye, Mummy.
Bye. Good boy.

36:20.882 --> 36:23.722
Jesus, what happened to you?
I slipped in the shower.

36:23.762 --> 36:27.442
You've been glued up. You look
terrible, sir, if you don't mind me
saying.

36:27.482 --> 36:30.402
Have you seen the Herald? Yeah, I
didn't know they'd done that.

36:30.442 --> 36:33.642
It's opened the floodgates. Media
officer's been deluged with calls.

36:33.682 --> 36:36.322
So I'm calling a conference for this
evening.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.602
A family statement - try and keep as
much control as we can.

36:39.642 --> 36:44.442
Meantime, I want full backgrounds on
Jack Marshall, Steve Connelly and
Paul Coates.

36:44.482 --> 36:46.602
Anyone without an alibi goes top of
our list.

36:46.642 --> 36:48.362
I'll get Frank and Nish on it.

36:48.402 --> 36:51.402
Sir, can I ask a favour?
I was thinking of going to church.

36:51.442 --> 36:55.002
That's a good idea. Everyone all
together, check who's behaving
normally.

36:55.042 --> 36:58.002
No, that wasn't the... Never mind.
What time's the service?

36:58.042 --> 37:00.042
In an hour.

37:01.722 --> 37:03.122
All right.

37:13.682 --> 37:16.282
Hey. I've got to tell you before we
go in.

37:16.842 --> 37:19.322
I saw Olly Stevens and Jack Marshall
yesterday.

37:19.362 --> 37:23.282
From what I can make out Olly was
saying... Jack's got a history with
kids.

37:23.322 --> 37:25.642
Bad stuff.
You're kidding?

37:26.602 --> 37:28.602
Beth! Beth!

37:30.282 --> 37:32.682
All right, lads? Just let them go
through.

37:37.242 --> 37:39.842
Away now, or I'll have you all
arrested!

37:40.242 --> 37:43.162
We're not breaking the law.
Have a bit of bloody decency.

37:43.202 --> 37:45.722
Lenses down or I will kick you all in
the balls.

37:46.462 --> 37:49.142
You didn't hear me say that. I
promise you I will.

37:49.582 --> 37:51.582
Your mum is awesome.
I know.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.502
Come for lunch today.
What?

38:07.542 --> 38:09.542
Nige is cooking.

38:10.262 --> 38:12.262
Like we always do.

38:13.902 --> 38:15.302
Jack.

38:23.222 --> 38:26.702
Didn't know he was religious.
Didn't know we were.

38:26.742 --> 38:28.742
Fair point.

38:36.182 --> 38:38.382
Hello, husband. How's the head?

38:44.182 --> 38:47.300
We are pressed on every side by
troubles.

38:47.602 --> 38:49.602
But we are not crushed.

38:50.282 --> 38:53.762
We are perplexed but not driven to
despair.

38:54.962 --> 38:59.242
We are hunted down,
but never abandoned by God.

39:00.522 --> 39:02.522
We are knocked down...

39:04.642 --> 39:06.642
but we are not destroyed.

39:08.442 --> 39:13.282
As a community, the hardest thing for
us is to remember,

39:13.322 --> 39:15.322
we have not been abandoned by God.

39:18.442 --> 39:20.442
We are not destroyed.

39:23.122 --> 39:25.122
Nor will we be.

39:34.202 --> 39:36.482
No? All right, I'll have it.
I want it.

39:41.202 --> 39:43.922
Quite a spread, Nige. You've got
hidden talents.

39:45.962 --> 39:48.682
You'll make someone a lovely husband
one day.

39:48.722 --> 39:50.722
They'll have to catch me first, Liz.

39:55.522 --> 40:00.402
I think one of those photographers
got in while we were out. I'll get a
lock first thing.

40:00.442 --> 40:03.482
You all right? You've been quiet.
What do you expect?

40:05.962 --> 40:07.722
Yeah.

40:08.082 --> 40:12.282
We should go in, get something to
eat. Get ready for this press
conference.

40:16.002 --> 40:18.162
Wahey!

40:19.442 --> 40:21.442
He's a beauty.

40:22.002 --> 40:23.602
Thanks.

40:25.562 --> 40:27.122
All right?
Yeah.

40:34.202 --> 40:36.482
Nige, there's a hair in it.

41:04.522 --> 41:07.122
You all right, sweetheart?
Yeah.

41:07.162 --> 41:08.762
You OK?

41:08.802 --> 41:11.682
Can I ask you something? You can say
no.

41:12.642 --> 41:14.642
Can I have a hug?

41:16.562 --> 41:18.562
OK.

41:21.282 --> 41:23.282
I miss his hugs.

41:31.242 --> 41:33.242
I'd best get that.

41:40.282 --> 41:42.122
You gonna have a cup of coffee?

41:42.162 --> 41:44.162
Jack's here.

41:47.362 --> 41:50.002
Everything all right?
I... found this.

41:50.922 --> 41:54.522
Heard the beeping from the delivery
bags. It was in the bag at the
bottom.

41:56.482 --> 41:58.882
He must have left it on his last
round.

41:58.922 --> 42:02.762
Yeah, that's Danny's phone, isn't it?
Mark, I'll take it. Give it here.

42:03.922 --> 42:06.442
What were you doing with this, Jack?
Mark.

42:08.402 --> 42:11.002
Mark, Beth...

42:12.442 --> 42:15.122
They're going to say things about me.
What sort of things?

42:15.162 --> 42:17.762
Those things aren't true.
Jack. Come on, love.

42:17.802 --> 42:21.802
Things happened before I was here,
and they'll be saying I did it.

42:21.842 --> 42:24.722
I'm looking you in the eye,
because he was your boy,

42:24.762 --> 42:27.162
and I'm telling you I'm not that kind
of man.

42:27.922 --> 42:30.082
Please. Believe me.

42:32.082 --> 42:34.002
You have to believe me.

42:36.082 --> 42:38.602
The bastards!
I'm with you, mate.

42:38.642 --> 42:41.682
Jack, I don't know what you're doing.
Come on, Jack.

42:41.722 --> 42:44.842
Piss off! Go on! Get away, go on!

42:44.882 --> 42:47.682
Public property this!
Is it? Is it?

42:47.722 --> 42:49.482
Out the way, Mark.

42:49.602 --> 42:53.362
Bad doggy! Bad doggy!

42:53.402 --> 42:56.882
Terrible weather!
We're going, all right?! Stop it!

42:59.442 --> 43:01.442
What have we done to ourselves, eh?

43:12.722 --> 43:14.722
Why do they need all of us?

43:16.682 --> 43:20.002
So people can understand
how much losing Danny meant to us.

43:20.042 --> 43:22.042
How strong a family we are.

43:22.082 --> 43:24.082
Right, are you ready for this?

43:24.122 --> 43:27.202
Chloe, you go at the far end
and then Beth and then Mark.

43:31.522 --> 43:33.522
I know about you and Becca Fisher.

43:38.482 --> 43:40.482
Mark, now, please.

43:47.922 --> 43:51.842
Sir. SOCO have confirmed the hairs
found on the boat - they match
Danny's.

43:51.882 --> 43:54.642
I knew it. Also, something from North
Yorkshire Police,

43:54.682 --> 43:57.562
about a killing on the cliffs in
Whitby 15 years back.

43:57.602 --> 44:00.802
They've seen the details and think
it's got similarities to our case.

44:00.842 --> 44:05.362
OK, later. Sir, Jack Marshall used to
live in North Yorkshire, five miles
from Whitby.

44:13.362 --> 44:15.762
We miss Danny a lot and erm...

44:16.842 --> 44:20.962
we just want whoever's done this
just to come forward because we're...

44:23.402 --> 44:27.682
we're having a horrible time not
knowing why this has happened to us.

44:28.122 --> 44:31.602
He was just a normal lad.
Never did anyone any harm.

44:31.642 --> 44:33.642
He was everything to us.

44:34.362 --> 44:36.642
We just want to know
what happened to our boy.

44:36.682 --> 44:41.042
If anybody out there knows, might
know, think they saw something...

44:42.042 --> 44:45.482
then you owe it to yourself
to come forward and tell the police.

44:46.202 --> 44:49.162
Cos whoever did this needs to be
caught.
