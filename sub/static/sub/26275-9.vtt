WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:04.038
Tim Allen is back
in Last Man Standing.

00:04.072 --> 00:06.807
Am I wrong, or is it, like,
way better on this network?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.576
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.411
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.444 --> 00:13.147
The Simpsons, Rel,
and The Cool Kids.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.648
Damn straight, we are.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.424
Wow. We got to get
a better vacuum cleaner.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.427
Got a tree growing right out of
the middle of the living room.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.230
Yeah, it's a good one
this year, Mike, yeah.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.400
And the smell, it's just--
it's-it's like it's hanging

00:32.433 --> 00:34.768
from a rearview mirror.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.104
Don't get too attached to it.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.039
In 30 days we'll be kicking
that baby to the curb.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.942
Hey, guys. Don't forget,
Kyle and I have plans tonight.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.945
You're not gonna help us
decorate the fire hazard?

00:44.978 --> 00:46.547
They are cultured, Mike.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.350
They are going to The Nutcracker
with Kristin and Ryan.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.918
Yeah. I've never been
to the ballet.

00:50.951 --> 00:54.522
I can't believe they get
to wear slippers to work.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.291
Well, buckle up. It's
three hours of people dancing,

00:57.325 --> 01:00.561
occasionally interrupted
by people prancing.

01:02.130 --> 01:06.100
So, tonight, tonight'll
just be you and me decorating.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.901
Hmm. You all right with that?

01:07.935 --> 01:09.103
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Definitely.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.771
It'll be like
when we were just married,

01:10.804 --> 01:13.441
except our tree won't be a fern.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.276
And we won't make the star
out of the tinfoil

01:15.309 --> 01:17.077
-out of a Jiffy Pop thing.
-Mm.

01:17.111 --> 01:21.282
You, uh, you remember
what we did with the butter?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.117
Okay.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.453
Come on, babe.
I'll take you to work.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.421
But don't you want to know
what they did with the butter?

01:27.455 --> 01:29.357
No.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.993
-Have fun, guys.
-MANDY: Eh.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.595
Do you, uh,
you have time to eat?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.597
No. I'll eat at work.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.266
A vending machine breakfast.

01:38.299 --> 01:43.137
Glazed doughnuts and pork rinds
and a emergency rain poncho.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.605
Hmm.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.407
You know what...

01:46.440 --> 01:49.410
I shouldn't give Ed a Christmas
gift this year, right?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.312
That'd be-- that'd be--
that'd be stupid.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.582
Well, no, you-you and Ed
never exchange gifts.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.150
Yeah. Yeah.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.486
But, you know, I thought
this year would be different

01:58.519 --> 01:59.687
'cause he retired.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.023
But that's not a good reason.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.593
No, I-I think
that's a great reason.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.528
But I have so much on my plate!

02:07.561 --> 02:10.364
I-It feels like you want me
to talk you out of this.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.100
Well, you're not doing
a really good job of it.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.768
Honey, this-this is
the first Christmas

02:14.802 --> 02:16.003
that Ed's not at the store.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.172
I-I think you should get him
something special.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.475
Now it's got to be
something special.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.911
*

02:29.183 --> 02:30.518
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.520
Just reminding you I'm leaving
a little early tonight.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.022
That's right. Mom said
you're going to The Nutcracker?

02:35.055 --> 02:37.358
Yay. Three hours
of people leaping

02:37.391 --> 02:40.328
interrupted by people prancing.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.497
Sometimes you make me so proud.

02:43.531 --> 02:47.034
Uh, but I finished my personnel
requests for next year.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.304
-You know, I could've just sent
that to you in an e-mail.
-Thanks.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.740
An e-mail doesn't keep loggers
employed.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.975
Plus, when I hold 'em
in my hand like this,

02:55.008 --> 02:57.845
I feel like I've finished
my job.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.981
But I'm not finished yet!
Chuck!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.884
-What's up?
-I'm gonna need
those personnel reports, man.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.085
I got to start making
these decisions

03:05.118 --> 03:06.387
before the end of the year.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.389
Oh! I'll have it to you
by the end of the day.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.891
(chuckles)
Carol's coming back from, uh,

03:10.924 --> 03:12.593
California for the holidays,
and, uh,

03:12.626 --> 03:14.695
I need time
to clean up the house.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.996
That's shocking.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.998
What, that a Marine
cleans his house?

03:18.031 --> 03:21.435
No, that Carol's coming back
to you?

03:21.469 --> 03:22.903
(chuckles)

03:22.936 --> 03:24.338
Good one, Baxter,

03:24.372 --> 03:26.106
he said,
pretending the cruel joke

03:26.139 --> 03:28.242
didn't trigger
his deepest insecurities.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.110
Hey, guys, can you think
of any Christmas gift

03:30.143 --> 03:31.412
-that Ed might want?
-(Mike sighs)

03:31.445 --> 03:33.947
How about a ticket
to The Nutcracker?

03:33.981 --> 03:38.686
Why didn't we just stop
having kids at you?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.220
Whenever I don't know
what to get someone,

03:40.254 --> 03:41.355
I just get 'em a cheesecake.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.623
Everybody likes cheesecake.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.625
And if they don't,
they might regift it to you

03:44.658 --> 03:47.194
and then, hey, free cheesecake.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.096
What's better than a cheesecake

03:49.129 --> 03:50.698
that's been passed around,
you know?

03:50.731 --> 03:54.134
With that little tinge
of salmonella in it. Yum, yum.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.470
Not everybody is as good
at giving gifts as you, Dad.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.871
Okay, you always know
what to get people.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.441
That's capitalism:
identify the consumer's need

04:00.474 --> 04:02.743
and supply it.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.777
Who said that?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.045
Dad's favorite philosopher,

04:05.078 --> 04:07.247
-himself.
-Oh.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.916
(chuckles)
He was thinking of putting it

04:08.949 --> 04:10.984
-at the entrance to Baxterland.
-Ah.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.553
At the corner of Mike Avenue

04:12.586 --> 04:14.555
-and Know-It-All Lane.
-(laughs)

04:14.588 --> 04:17.257
This know-it-all
might have just figured out

04:17.291 --> 04:19.793
what to get Ed for Christmas.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.129
Um...
(grunts)

04:22.162 --> 04:23.964
general rule of thumb:
when I leave my office,

04:23.997 --> 04:27.134
it's a good idea for everyone
else to leave my office.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.103
-But there's toys.
-But there's toys.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.979
* God rest ye merry, gentlemen

04:39.012 --> 04:40.648
* Ye... ye...

04:40.681 --> 04:45.786
* Ye really do look tired.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.356
-Wow, Mom, you're really
in the Christmas spirit.
-Mm!

04:48.389 --> 04:50.924
Well, I'm doing one of
my favorite things in the world.

04:50.958 --> 04:51.925
(chuckles)

04:51.959 --> 04:54.061
And decorating the tree.

04:55.563 --> 04:58.666
Ah. Uh, you guys--
you're-you're leaving early.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.701
Oh, yeah, we're gonna meet
at Kristin and Ryan's.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.837
-You have the tickets, babe?
-Yeah. Uh, right here.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.706
(chuckles)
Uh-oh.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.808
Says we're in the orchestra.

05:07.841 --> 05:12.045
I haven't played the tuba
since high school.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.681
MANDY:
Oh, Mom... (chuckles)

05:13.714 --> 05:15.783
you don't have to hang
my snowflake ornament

05:15.816 --> 05:16.850
I made in the second grade.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.285
Are you kidding?
I love this.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.721
Great, because that was a test.
Where you gonna put it?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.490
Uh...

05:22.523 --> 05:25.493
well, I was thinking of just--
I'm putting it right here?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.461
There? Okay.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.863
Why? You have a better idea?

05:29.897 --> 05:30.998
-Yes, several.
-Okay.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.367
Oh.
(giggles) Uh,

05:33.401 --> 05:35.536
Mandy was always in charge
of ornaments.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.372
Yeah, because I'm great
with visual placement.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.542
And I'm really, really tall.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.844
I'll just do one
to get you started.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.745
Can I do one?

05:44.778 --> 05:45.813
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.747
Here, you can have your pick.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.050
They're all wrapped
in newspaper.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.353
Oh, this is from way back
in January.

05:53.387 --> 05:56.590
Boy, did we miss out
on a furniture sale.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.226
You know what, uh,

05:59.259 --> 06:00.994
this is gonna take me
a little bit of time.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.697
So I'll just text Kristin and
tell them to pick us up here.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.066
Are you sure? Honey, you know,
you don't have to. It...

06:06.099 --> 06:07.435
Mom, if I let you decorate
the tree,

06:07.468 --> 06:09.637
it'll take me hours to fix.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.274
No offense. Merry Christmas.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.513
Man, you're still working?

06:19.547 --> 06:21.415
Carol's not gonna like it
if you're late, unless she's...

06:21.449 --> 06:23.116
on California time, dude.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.919
-(inhales)
-(chuckles)

06:25.953 --> 06:29.022
Well, you asked me to get
a job done, so I'll get it done.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.190
And it'll be letter-perfect.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.292
Besides, Carol's still on

06:32.325 --> 06:35.496
Colorado "your ass
better be on time" time.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.132
Hey, Ed. Glad I saw you.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.601
-I-I got something for you.
-Good.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.270
I-I wanted to hand deliver
these Christmas cards.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.272
-Much more personal
than the mail.
-Oh.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.640
Not to mention cheaper.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.778
125 employees times 50 cents.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.212
Adds up.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.413
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Very good.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.615
I did the math.
Thank you very much.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.416
Come on, give me a break.
Give me a break.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.152
I'm-I'm a retiree
on a fixed income, all right?

06:59.186 --> 07:01.822
On your personal mega yacht.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.090
(chuckles)

07:03.123 --> 07:06.760
(mutters) Listen, what are you
doing here so late anyway, huh?

07:06.794 --> 07:09.730
Don't tell me that
Mike Baxter has gotten behind.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.899
The only thing I'm behind
is Reaganomics.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.669
And you're welcome
for the boom-boom '80s, man.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.872
Still waiting
for my trickle-down over here.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.942
Anyway, thanks for the card.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.478
But I did have extra time to get
something for Christmas for you.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.579
So just wait there a minute.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.415
I-I just have a minute.
Just a minute now here.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.617
I'm tending bar at the VFW.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.318
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.654
I used to host
Military Trivia Night.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.355
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, we had to give it up

07:35.388 --> 07:38.325
because, uh, most of the answers
were "Germany."

07:39.326 --> 07:40.661
-Listen.
-Yeah.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.096
The city says
we can name our access road

07:43.130 --> 07:44.865
-to the store anything we want.
-Uh-huh.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.300
So...

07:47.334 --> 07:49.336
What? Come on.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.672
Ed Alzate Way?

07:51.705 --> 07:53.541
So the road that brings people
to Outdoor Man

07:53.574 --> 07:57.878
now honors the man that brought
Outdoor Man to the people.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.012
I love that road, Mikey.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.949
It's-it's black down the middle,
beige on the sides.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.316
Now, that's a road.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.785
Yeah, well, now the guys
in the loading dock...

08:04.818 --> 08:05.886
-Yeah.
-won't just say, "Look,

08:05.919 --> 08:07.454
there's a dead raccoon
in the road."

08:07.487 --> 08:11.024
They can say, "There's a
dead raccoon on Ed Alzate."

08:11.058 --> 08:13.894
(laughing)

08:13.927 --> 08:15.696
Well, that's--
Mikey, you're the best, buddy.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.198
-Yeah.
-You're-you're terrific.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.533
Chuck, look at this.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.868
I got a street.
(chuckles)

08:20.901 --> 08:22.970
-I got a street.
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

08:23.003 --> 08:25.573
Okay, good.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.676
Did he seem a little too happy?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.044
Yep.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.713
So, he hated it.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.748
Yep.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.556
Hey, Mike Baxter
for Outdoor Man.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.692
Christmas is just around
the corner,

08:44.725 --> 08:46.894
so someone you love
is out there right now

08:46.927 --> 08:49.597
getting you something
you don't need, you don't want,

08:49.630 --> 08:53.000
and you can't return
until they're not looking.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.668
And the kicker for some of you

08:54.702 --> 08:56.269
is they're doing it
with your money.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.771
Wow.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.007
Yeah, the biggest challenge
of the holiday season

09:00.040 --> 09:02.542
isn't long lines
or finding a place to park--

09:02.576 --> 09:05.378
it's opening a present
and not having your face say

09:05.412 --> 09:07.080
what you're actually feeling.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.582
See, your face has to say...

09:08.616 --> 09:10.417
(chuckles):
"Oh, I really love this."

09:10.450 --> 09:12.419
And what
you're really thinking is,

09:12.452 --> 09:14.955
"Really? Really?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.624
Really?"

09:16.657 --> 09:19.259
We all want a present
that knocks our socks off,

09:19.292 --> 09:21.762
but we don't want socks.

09:21.795 --> 09:25.532
Ben Carson said, "Happiness
doesn't result from what we get

09:25.565 --> 09:27.534
but from what we give."

09:27.567 --> 09:30.103
Spoken like someone whose family
gets him lousy gifts.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.739
Right, Ben?
(chuckles)

09:31.772 --> 09:34.875
If only there was a retail chain
where you could be confident

09:34.908 --> 09:37.210
they're gonna love
whatever you get them.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.747
Oh, wait, I'm sitting in one.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.449
And in Outdoor Man, if you
don't like your new crossbow,

09:42.482 --> 09:43.450
you can return it.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.885
But you're gonna like it.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.887
Because, unlike the people
buying your gifts,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.657
our crossbows actually hit
their targets.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.892
So, from all of us
at Outdoor Man

09:51.925 --> 09:53.894
to all of you looking
for the perfect gift,

09:53.927 --> 09:56.764
happy hunting
and merry Christmas.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.932
Baxter out.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.637
Ooh.

10:03.671 --> 10:07.074
It's the box
with the stockings, babe.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.476
Uh-oh.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.444
You gonna be okay?

10:11.478 --> 10:12.780
Should I get the tissues?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.481
No, I'm fine.
(chuckles)

10:14.514 --> 10:16.684
I think I got it all out
of my system last year.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.151
(car horn honking in distance)

10:18.185 --> 10:20.520
So what if Mrs. B sewed my name
on a stocking

10:20.553 --> 10:23.090
that welcomed me to the family?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.424
It's no big deal.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.592
(sniffles)

10:25.625 --> 10:29.462
It's just a love stocking.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.832
Guys, hey. Hello?
Ryan's been honking.

10:31.865 --> 10:36.169
Uh, Kristin,
a lady never responds to a honk.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.338
Ooh! The tree looks great.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.673
Nice balance, Mandy.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.809
Thanks. It's subtle.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.744
The theme is
"Christmas Here and Now!"

10:45.078 --> 10:46.279
Hey, Kristin.
I thought I heard you.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.280
-Oh, hey, Mom.
-Hi.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.281
Mwah.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.884
Oh, no, Kyle found his stocking.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.987
It's a beauty, Mrs. B.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.355
Well, maybe we should keep it
out all year

10:55.388 --> 10:57.190
so you don't get so overwhelmed.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.160
No, I-I can handle it.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.997
Ryan, I thought
we were on our way out.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.699
I know. Boyd has
to use the bathroom.

11:05.733 --> 11:09.202
I'll be fast.
I won't even wash my hands.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.738
Ooh, is that hot chocolate?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.740
Uh, yeah.
Kyle and Mandy insisted.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.708
I'd make you guys some, but...

11:14.742 --> 11:17.711
-but don't you have to go?
-Uh, we have time. Right, Ryan?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.347
-Uh... okay, yeah. One cup.
-Yeah?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.716
Um, with some marshmallows.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.752
-Yeah. Okay.
-And maybe a little nutmeg.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.154
Actually, you know what?
I'll just make it.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.724
Oh, Mandy, wow, the tree
is really looking great.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.825
KRISTIN:
Uh...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.326
actually, I wouldn't say great.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.527
I'd say incomplete.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.096
There's no candy canes.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.565
Well, I wasn't going to do that.
That's your job.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.534
Well, I guess I can
at least start. (giggles)

11:41.568 --> 11:43.570
And you're right, it is my job,

11:43.603 --> 11:45.538
because I am great at it.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.240
Cool! Are we all
gonna decorate the tree?

11:47.274 --> 11:50.543
No, no, no. I'm sorry, sweetie.
You probably have to go.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.679
Do we?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.749
I think your dad really wants
to see the ballet.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.418
You know what? I am back there
making the perfect cup of cocoa,

11:58.451 --> 12:01.088
and I realize I'm not even
gonna have time to drink it.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.223
Oh. Maybe you could.
Uh, how would you feel

12:03.256 --> 12:05.725
about staying a little while
and helping with the tree?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.761
Uh... well,
we have really good seats,

12:07.795 --> 12:10.230
and, I mean, it's just a tree.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.099
Hey, Ryan, check it out.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.434
It's your stocking.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.636
(choked up):
Oh, boy.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.674
Yeah, there it is.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.246
*

12:26.279 --> 12:27.614
-Hey, Ed?
-Hmm?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.917
Do you know how to make
a cosmopolitan?

12:29.950 --> 12:32.652
Of course, of course, yeah.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.888
I just won't.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.256
Okay.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.097
-What are you doing here?
-Well, after your little
performance at work,

12:44.131 --> 12:47.467
I thought I'd stop by and
find out why you hated my gift.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.838
I didn't hate it. I loved it.
Best gift I ever got.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.940
And the Oscar goes
to anybody else.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.808
Come on, why did you hate it?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
All right, all right.
I didn't like it.

12:56.509 --> 13:00.280
You know who gets streets
named after them? Dead guys.

13:00.313 --> 13:04.651
This is why I gave it to you
this year and not... next year.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.187
Made me realize
that my career at Outdoor Man

13:07.220 --> 13:08.521
is really over.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.824
You also realize
you could come back to work

13:10.858 --> 13:12.459
anytime you wanted?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.627
When a man wakes up
in the morning,

13:14.661 --> 13:16.696
he needs to wake up
with a purpose.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.499
You see, I'm not needed
at Outdoor Man.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.102
I realize that now,
thanks to you.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.305
Doesn't sound like
you're very grateful.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.874
I actually am.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.477
I need to look forward,
Mikey, not backwards.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.846
All right, I think I understand.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.681
You know what?
I don't think you do, really.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.049
You know why I tend bar here?

13:36.083 --> 13:39.152
Sure. You don't have to pay
for Sex on the Beach.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.721
Because I like to talk
to the veterans here

13:41.754 --> 13:44.357
who feel the same way I do.
Like Billy there.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.626
Yeah, look at him.
He ran a munitions depot.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.395
Huge warehouse.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.231
Yes, moved ordnance
all over the Middle East. Yeah.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.533
Now he drives an Uber.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.068
Really?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.970
Yeah, just until he
finds a place

13:57.004 --> 13:59.172
that can use his unique skills.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.174
We all have hope.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.210
Yep.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.212
-You make a great bartender.
-Yeah.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.180
Listen, if you want
to give me another gift,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.182
I could use a...
a new cashmere coat.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.651
You know, I think
I'm done giving gifts.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.221
What do I look like,
Santa Claus?

14:21.728 --> 14:24.064
-Oh, Kris,
what are you doing here?
-Hmm.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.665
Nutcracker started,
what, a half hour ago.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.601
You're gonna miss the "Dance
of the Fairy Nuts," or whatever.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.004
I'm gonna be
completely honest with you.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.606
The Nutcracker can kiss my ass.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.377
This kid!

14:38.778 --> 14:40.948
Isn't this great?
Th-The Christmas spirit

14:40.981 --> 14:43.250
burst in here,
grabbed them by their throats

14:43.283 --> 14:45.218
and won't let them leave.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.887
Sounds like
a scary Christmas movie.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.757
"This year, Santa doesn't care
who's naughty or nice--

14:50.790 --> 14:52.725
everybody's gettin' it."

14:54.261 --> 14:56.229
Hey, take a look
at this Christmas tree.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.731
I made it look fabulous
from every angle.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.768
It's the Beyoncé
of Christmas trees.

15:01.801 --> 15:05.238
If you like it, then you
better put a star on it.

15:06.773 --> 15:10.443
Starting to regret
putting a ring on it.

15:10.477 --> 15:14.114
Hey, Dad, look how good Kyle's
getting at stringing popcorn.

15:14.147 --> 15:18.285
Yeah, the key I've learned
is making sure you pop it first.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.653
And I made my special
family cocoa recipe.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.222
The secret ingredient is

15:22.255 --> 15:24.124
(whispers):
peppermint schnapps.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.393
KRISTIN:
Mmm.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.329
Ah, Ryan made mine extra secret.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.800
Is this okay?
I know we were planning

15:33.833 --> 15:35.635
on it just being the two of us.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.972
-As hard as I try, I just
can't get sick of these kids.
-Yeah.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.008
It's just too bad
Eve's not here, huh?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.043
-(sighs): Well...
-(doorbell rings)

15:45.512 --> 15:47.314
Oh, my God...

15:47.347 --> 15:50.117
Oh, it's Chuck.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.454
-VANESSA: Hi. How are you?
-CHUCK: Hey, everybody.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.024
I got those personnel requests
you wanted.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.492
Thank you, man, good for you.

15:59.526 --> 16:03.463
Boy, you military guys sure get
the job done, don't you? Yes!

16:03.496 --> 16:05.465
Well, you asked a Marine
for a thorough job.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.500
That's like asking the Pope
to go to church.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.003
You know he's gonna stay
for the whole Mass.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.272
I just wish
I had more guys like you.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.207
(chuckles):
Well, thanks, Baxter.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.477
Someone's getting a cheesecake.
Feel free to regift.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.878
Merry Christmas, everybody.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.280
-Merry Christmas, Chuck.
-Merry Christmas.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.382
-Good-bye.
-Merry Christmas, Chuck.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.720
Hey, honey?
I got a little errand to do.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.489
But, honey,
the whole family's here.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.991
I know, I got to go to a bar.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.729
*

16:39.199 --> 16:42.069
Hey. Look, I'm glad I found you
before you took off

16:42.102 --> 16:44.871
-on your trip.
-Yeah?

16:44.904 --> 16:46.539
What's this?

16:46.573 --> 16:51.144
It's a chance for you to give me
a nice gift, you cheap bastard.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.346
Because of the awesome job
I'm doing at Outdoor Man,

16:53.380 --> 16:55.248
we're expanding.
These are personnel reports

16:55.282 --> 16:57.917
from each department.
We're looking for new hires.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.320
Well, thanks for explaining
the business to me.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.989
Let me return the favor
by reminding you

17:03.022 --> 17:05.192
that you have
a personnel department.

17:05.225 --> 17:09.596
You know exactly the kind
of people I want for these jobs.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.164
So you came here to brag, huh?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.832
You're a piece of work, Mikey.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.568
Listen. I want people
looking for a place

17:15.602 --> 17:18.538
to apply their unique skills.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.875
-You're talking about veterans?
-Mm-hmm.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.677
These people?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.947
And I'm looking for somebody who
knows their specific skill sets,

17:27.980 --> 17:30.517
so they can match them
to the correct position.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.784
Ed...

17:31.818 --> 17:33.953
we need you.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.090
I'd say you're just being nice,

17:37.124 --> 17:40.693
but we both know that's...
that's not your strong suit.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.095
Listen, this isn't just Denver.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.763
I mean, this is all the stores.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.133
-We're gonna be doing
a lot of new hires.
-Yeah.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.535
Obviously, we'd coordinate
with local VFWs and the VA.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.104
Also, I could reach out
to the discharge offices

17:51.138 --> 17:53.039
-of military bases.
-Yep.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.407
Sounds like
a lot of work for a guy

17:54.441 --> 17:57.377
who just started his career
as a bartender.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.146
Department of Labor has
a Veterans' Employment

17:59.179 --> 18:01.214
-and Training site.
I'll contact them.
-Mm-hmm.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.117
I like the fact
you still use paper, Mikey.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.653
Well, you know me--
old-fashioned.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.720
Yeah, me, too, pal.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.323
No, I'd like you to make me
an old-fashioned.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.225
Yeah. Please.
I've got work to do.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.294
Now, what the hell
are you doing here?

18:14.327 --> 18:17.297
Wow. I missed
your sunny disposition.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.600
Mikey, they always said
you give the best gifts.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.335
They're right.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.839
*

18:26.873 --> 18:28.408
We should do this again
next year.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.910
It's way more fun
than going to the ballet.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.345
Yeah. I'm a little bummed.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.647
I mean, when will I ever get
another chance

18:34.681 --> 18:38.151
to see The Nutcracker
at Christmas?

18:38.185 --> 18:40.420
You know, this might be
the schnapps talking,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.422
-but I love you guys.
-VANESSA: Aw.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.924
Mmm, it's definitely
the schnapps. (chuckles)

18:44.957 --> 18:46.426
But me, too!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.161
Cheers, everyone!

18:48.195 --> 18:50.663
Geez, settle down, people.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.900
-Hey, Dad.
-I don't know what's more lit,
the tree or you people.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.103
Where... where'd you go?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.339
Uh, VFW Hall.
Worked something out with Ed.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.174
Oh. Well, good.
I'm glad you're back.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.210
You know, I was excited
about starting a new tradition

19:03.243 --> 19:05.778
with just the two of us,
but I'm glad the kids want

19:05.812 --> 19:07.447
to keep our old
family traditions alive.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.449
Well, we have these traditions,
'cause a lot

19:09.482 --> 19:11.818
-of brave men and women
fought for them.
-Yeah.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.687
I guess the only thing
we have left to do is to...

19:14.721 --> 19:15.988
put the star on the tree.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.457
Yeah. Eve used to do that,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.659
but I guess I'll do it,
'cause none of you

19:19.692 --> 19:22.662
should get on a stepladder,
I'll tell you that right now.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.164
Wait, Mom, where is the star?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.334
Well, since your dad and I
were planning on starting

19:27.367 --> 19:29.569
-a new tradition,
I-I ordered a new one...
-MIKE: What?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.671
and it is being delivered
right now.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.705
(doorbell rings)

19:32.739 --> 19:35.208
Who delivers a star that fast?

19:35.242 --> 19:38.044
Ooh, maybe it's Santa.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.913
Oh, I haven't finished my list.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.217
Hey, hey...

19:44.251 --> 19:47.119
-(laughs)
-Hey, Dad! Merry Christmas!

19:51.190 --> 19:53.226
I thought it was gonna be Chuck.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.562
I was supposed to bring a star.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.897
Hey, you are the star.
Come on in.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.666
-Come here! Hi.
-Hi.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.767
Yeah.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.235
How did you do this?

20:02.269 --> 20:04.571
Well, when the kids decided
to stay and help decorate,

20:04.604 --> 20:07.507
I called Eve and-and convinced
her to hop on the bus.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.542
Yeah, which sounded horrible,
so I took an Uber.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.279
Mmm. Wait a minute.
You took an Uber?

20:12.312 --> 20:16.182
-Yeah. You owe me $111.
-(laughter)

20:16.215 --> 20:18.618
Well, it was so worth it
to have you here.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.388
Shouldn't we all get $111?

20:21.421 --> 20:24.691
You know what? This family
loves its traditions.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.359
Yeah. Old-fashioned.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.528
Yeah, yeah,
we are kind of old-fashioned.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.163
No. I'm gonna make
an old-fashioned.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.138
* Four calling birds,
three French hens *

20:39.171 --> 20:40.773
* Two turtle doves

20:40.807 --> 20:43.276
* And a partridge
in a pear tree. *

20:43.310 --> 20:45.278
You know why that's called
"The Twelve Days of Christmas"?

20:45.312 --> 20:47.447
'Cause that's how long it takes
to sing the damn song.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.248
All right?
Guys, we got to think

20:49.282 --> 20:51.418
-of something else.
-Okay, don't anyone go anywhere.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.153
-We have written
a new Christmas carol.
-Oh.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.789
-It's gonna be a classic.
-(clearing throats)

20:56.823 --> 20:59.459
* Hark, now listen to us sing

20:59.492 --> 21:02.228
* How Baxters do
their Christmas thing *

21:02.261 --> 21:04.564
* Mom, she sips
her spiked eggnog *

21:04.597 --> 21:07.166
MANDY: * Dad records
his Yuletide vlog *

21:07.199 --> 21:08.768
KRISTIN, MANDY AND EVE:
* A drive to the ER

21:08.801 --> 21:10.269
* In the snow

21:10.303 --> 21:12.805
* Because Kyle ate mistletoe

21:12.839 --> 21:14.641
It was one time.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.276
* Fruitcake sitting
under the tree *

21:17.310 --> 21:19.612
* That's for Ryan,
it's gluten-free *

21:19.646 --> 21:20.847
KRISTIN, MANDY AND EVE:
* Dad thinks we've

21:20.880 --> 21:22.449
* Gone on too long

21:22.482 --> 21:26.218
* So we will end
our Baxter song. *

21:27.354 --> 21:29.756
I love it, I love it.
Thank you, guys.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.025
I hope that's not
my only Christmas gift.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.762
Oh, uh, uh,
well, we have another. Uh...

21:35.795 --> 21:37.096
-MIKE: Great.
-Hmm?

21:37.129 --> 21:40.166
* We wish you
a Baxter Christmas *

21:40.199 --> 21:42.168
* We wish you a Baxter
Christmas *

21:42.201 --> 21:46.506
* We wish you
a Baxter Christmas... *

21:46.539 --> 21:49.909
* And a happy New Year!
