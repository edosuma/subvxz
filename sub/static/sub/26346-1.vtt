00:25.657 --> 00:29.292
You think she remembers?

00:29.294 --> 00:30.926
Here you go.

00:30.928 --> 00:34.798
No. It was a long time ago.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.500
Oh.

00:37.502 --> 00:40.305
Here's your tea, Cynthia.

00:41.806 --> 00:44.774
What a little chatter box.

00:44.776 --> 00:47.777
Jason, who's
Samantha's imaginary friend?

00:47.779 --> 00:49.746
Cynthia.

00:49.748 --> 00:50.947
That's a pretty name.

02:07.025 --> 02:08.960
Little freak.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.854
I can...
I can... I can't...

03:10.856 --> 03:12.956
What's wrong?
you're like a limp fish.

03:12.958 --> 03:16.625
I'm tired. I
haven't even had my coffee

03:16.627 --> 03:20.730
I'm tired too. You think
this is any fun for me?

03:20.732 --> 03:24.099
Oh, wow, thanks. That makes me
feel special. I'm like a turkey

03:24.101 --> 03:25.235
baster with legs.

03:25.237 --> 03:28.205
Can we not do
this now Michael please.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.907
Can we just finish
and talk about this later?

03:30.909 --> 03:32.107
No I'm not in the mood,

03:32.109 --> 03:34.110
Well get in the mood.

03:34.112 --> 03:37.948
Insemination, IUI - timed
intercourse has to take place

03:37.950 --> 03:39.116
in the morning.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.885
I know but I can't perform
on command like some circus

03:41.887 --> 03:43.687
clown every time we
are scheduled for 'timed'

03:43.689 --> 03:44.887
procreation.

03:44.889 --> 03:48.724
Oh... Do I make you feel like
a clown? Am I a clown to you?

03:48.726 --> 03:50.760
What is that... Joe
Pesci? Am I sleeping with

03:50.762 --> 03:52.896
Joe Pesci? I think that
might be part of the problem...

03:52.898 --> 03:55.866
"I'm funny how? I'm funny like a
clown? Like I amuse you in the

03:55.868 --> 03:56.999
sack?"

03:57.001 --> 04:00.871
That's a terrible Joe Pesci.

04:00.873 --> 04:05.774
If you ever do that again I
will never have sex with you.

04:05.776 --> 04:09.714
Promise?

04:15.153 --> 04:18.858
I'm sorry I'm a limp fish.

04:19.156 --> 04:24.560
I never thought
sex could be so... unsexy.

04:24.562 --> 04:27.697
I know.

04:27.699 --> 04:29.798
We can't give up on this.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.835
I don't want to keep on getting
the shots if we're not going to

04:31.837 --> 04:34.837
keep on trying.

04:34.839 --> 04:40.142
I mean... Maybe it's just not
meant to be. You know?

04:40.144 --> 04:45.114
I mean. we can't keep doing this
forever unless you want to be

04:45.116 --> 04:48.183
homeless and I'll be giving you
shots in a cardboard box.

04:48.185 --> 04:52.188
It's not funny.
Do you want a baby or not?

04:52.190 --> 04:55.190
Seriously Michael, how
could you put a price on this?

04:55.192 --> 04:57.193
Robin, everytime
we do this it's 10,000 dollars.

04:57.195 --> 04:59.962
Yeah of course I want a baby,
but this cheap crap from China

04:59.964 --> 05:02.065
it's not even working.

05:02.067 --> 05:06.736
Don't say that.
We agreed whatever the cost.

05:06.738 --> 05:07.904
I said that?

05:07.906 --> 05:09.638
Yes.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.775
I don't remember saying that.

05:12.777 --> 05:13.876
I wish you were
more like your sister.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.344
She got
pregnant without any help.

05:15.346 --> 05:17.781
That's because Jane
didn't want a baby and got

05:17.783 --> 05:20.984
knocked up... accidentally!

05:20.986 --> 05:24.955
I mean... how lucky is that?

05:24.957 --> 05:27.289
Yeah... maybe we're
trying too hard, we're forcing

05:27.291 --> 05:29.325
nature. We should
just let it happen naturally.

05:29.327 --> 05:32.628
By that rate I'll be thirty
by the time I have a baby.

05:32.630 --> 05:34.897
We can always adopt.

05:34.899 --> 05:39.001
I don't want to adopt!
Ever since I was a little girl

05:39.003 --> 05:43.005
I wanted a baby of my own.
Someone I could love, who would

05:43.007 --> 05:46.241
love me back,
I could take care of.

05:46.243 --> 05:50.246
You know, a baby
that's a part of both of us.

05:50.248 --> 05:58.387
Without a baby I feel like,
I'm not complete as a woman.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.390
And I'm not going
to be the only one of

06:00.392 --> 06:02.926
my friends at my high school
reunion that doesn't have a

06:02.928 --> 06:04.794
baby! I won't!

06:04.796 --> 06:07.863
Who cares about a stupid
high school reunion anyways?

06:07.865 --> 06:10.065
I mean it's...

06:10.067 --> 06:11.900
You know what? I don't
have time to argue with you.

06:11.902 --> 06:14.104
I have to go to work,
you're going to get me fired.

06:14.106 --> 06:16.906
Aren't you the Vice President of
Sales, can't you choose your

06:16.908 --> 06:17.707
hours?

06:17.709 --> 06:19.775
I don't dictate
company policy.

06:19.777 --> 06:22.245
You know how important
it is for me to have a child.

06:22.247 --> 06:24.781
Really? It's the first
time you've mentioned it.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.282
Don't joke.

06:26.284 --> 06:29.185
Honey, I have to go to work to
pay for the shots and pills.

06:29.187 --> 06:30.185
Is that okay with you?

06:30.187 --> 06:32.822
Whatever. Maybe the
mailman will knock me up

06:32.824 --> 06:35.157
while you're at work?

06:35.159 --> 06:38.895
That's fine, honey. That'll
actually save us some invitro.

06:38.897 --> 06:43.868
I'm gonna go to work now.
I love you and I might be late.

06:48.106 --> 06:53.379
Fluffy. I guess
you're my only child.

07:03.854 --> 07:07.690
It's a beautiful shot!?

07:07.692 --> 07:11.327
So close. So close.

07:11.329 --> 07:12.828
I don't get it.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.863
Cricket is followed by
more than a billion people.

07:14.865 --> 07:18.101
They can live
without you getting it.

07:18.103 --> 07:19.935
Besides, it's just
like American baseball.

07:19.937 --> 07:21.938
It's nothing like baseball.
At least you can understand

07:21.940 --> 07:25.108
baseball. Cricket is impossible.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.010
What's to understand?
A bunch of blokes

07:27.012 --> 07:29.212
in white sweaters and slacks run
around for a week tossing and

07:29.214 --> 07:30.080
whacking a ball.

07:30.082 --> 07:30.948
It's just like baseball.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.116
That's my point.
How long is a cricket

07:33.118 --> 07:34.351
match?

07:34.353 --> 07:38.320
Well, a test can go for five
days... thats eight hours each day

07:38.322 --> 07:39.488
including breaks.

07:39.490 --> 07:42.092
That's nothing like baseball!
Baseball is nine innings.

07:42.094 --> 07:44.359
It's three hours long.
No wonder Cricket is so

07:44.361 --> 07:45.995
boring.
What's the point?

07:45.997 --> 07:48.298
What's the point to any
professional sport?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.734
To get paid
and laid my friend.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.335
Cricketeers get
gobs of minge.

07:53.337 --> 07:53.902
Minge??

07:53.904 --> 07:56.138
You know... Morris Minor.

07:56.140 --> 07:56.940
What?

07:56.942 --> 08:00.142
...tuppence,
quim, twat, coont...

08:00.144 --> 08:03.178
Why can't you English
people speak English?

08:03.180 --> 08:05.214
Why don't you
Americans understand geography?

08:05.216 --> 08:06.983
I don't understand
what you said right now.

08:06.985 --> 08:09.118
I wouldn't have thought so.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.786
Uno mas por favor.

08:10.788 --> 08:15.361
Alright, that's your last one.
I'm cutting you off, mate.

08:16.995 --> 08:19.195
Well then, cheers...
bottoms up...

08:19.197 --> 08:20.462
Bottoms up.

08:20.464 --> 08:22.198
God save the queen...

08:22.200 --> 08:24.937
That's England again.

08:29.173 --> 08:32.274
Jesus Christ.
What's got you down mate?

08:32.275 --> 08:34.144
Trouble with the missus?

08:34.145 --> 08:35.943
All she ever talks
about is getting pregnant.

08:35.946 --> 08:40.316
This whole fertility thing.
She is driving me to drink.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.885
Good. I should be
paying her a commission.

08:43.888 --> 08:45.789
How long you
been tryin' to knock her up for?

08:45.791 --> 08:48.390
Three years. Yeah. Let's see.

08:48.392 --> 08:50.360
Twenty-five
injections a month...

08:50.362 --> 08:54.097
- Yikes.
- That is around 900 IVF shots.

08:54.099 --> 08:57.567
Wow. Poor lass
is a pin cushion.

08:57.569 --> 08:59.034
What's an IVF shot?

08:59.036 --> 09:02.805
In vitro fertilization.

09:02.807 --> 09:05.408
I have to
give the shots to her myself.

09:05.410 --> 09:09.044
And if that's not bad
enough, we have to screw

09:09.046 --> 09:12.215
on a morning schedule when
neither of us even feel like

09:12.217 --> 09:13.882
touching.

09:13.884 --> 09:16.553
Well you look
knackered. How do you feel?

09:16.555 --> 09:21.457
Like a sperm in a dustbowl.

09:21.459 --> 09:24.561
I could never get married...
too many fish in the sea.

09:24.563 --> 09:28.198
If you know what I mean.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.400
Looks like
you've got work to do.

09:31.402 --> 09:33.336
All she ever talks
about is getting pregnant.

09:33.338 --> 09:34.370
She's obsessed.

09:34.372 --> 09:36.039
You think it's bad now?

09:36.041 --> 09:39.909
Wait till she spits
out...'has' the wee one.

09:39.911 --> 09:42.212
Then you'll be on
the back burner, for life.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.246
That baby will
get all the love and attention

09:44.248 --> 09:49.052
you used to enjoy and he'll spit
up and poop all over you just

09:49.054 --> 09:49.986
for fun.

09:49.988 --> 09:51.486
Wow you make
childbirth sound wonderful.

09:51.488 --> 09:53.222
Hey, you're the
one sitting in a bar

09:53.224 --> 09:54.289
while your wife
thinks you're at work.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.024
It's a working lunch.

09:56.026 --> 10:01.065
Haven't seen
you do much work.

11:32.589 --> 11:35.558
Michael.

11:38.964 --> 11:43.435
Ok and... there's the heart.

11:43.701 --> 11:45.601
Wow, look at that big eye.

11:45.603 --> 11:50.342
is that a frog? Like a...
little amphibian frog.

11:51.343 --> 11:52.342
- Interesting.
- What?

11:52.344 --> 11:54.376
Excuse me.

11:54.378 --> 12:00.015
Ah, hopefully, good news.

12:00.017 --> 12:00.951
"Hopefully?"

12:00.953 --> 12:04.123
Ah, looks like you're
going to have... twins.

12:05.623 --> 12:08.390
- Okay.
- Twins as in... uhm...

12:08.392 --> 12:11.461
as in two... babies...
that... they look alike?

12:11.463 --> 12:12.028
That's right.

12:12.030 --> 12:14.632
Twins? As in two babies?

12:16.166 --> 12:17.936
Just a moment.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.071
It's a tumor, I fucked up.

12:22.073 --> 12:23.271
What is it? What's wrong?

12:23.273 --> 12:28.177
Ahh... It looks like it's not a
twin after all, I'm so sorry.

12:28.179 --> 12:30.214
No, thank God.

12:31.148 --> 12:33.484
Sorry, honey.

12:34.018 --> 12:36.318
If it's not a
baby... what is it?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.587
Oh, uh, nothing
to worry about. It appears

12:38.589 --> 12:42.725
to be a large uterine fibroid
but we'll need to do some tests.

12:42.727 --> 12:46.095
A tumor?
Do I have Cancer?

12:46.097 --> 12:47.597
No no, nothing,
nothing like that.

12:47.599 --> 12:49.298
Let's not
jump to conclusions.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.400
Fibroid
cysts are not that uncommon.

12:51.402 --> 12:54.136
But we'll need to do an
endometrial biopsy to know more.

12:54.138 --> 12:55.038
An endo what?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.773
It's a simple
procedure where we take a

12:56.775 --> 13:00.279
tissue sample from
the lining of Robin's uterus.

13:01.780 --> 13:05.715
Do we have to do that?
Can it hurt the baby?

13:05.717 --> 13:09.519
Oh, no, no, no. It's
quite safe. Quite safe.

13:09.521 --> 13:11.687
When would we do it?

13:11.689 --> 13:13.823
Well, we can do
it now, I have an hour

13:13.825 --> 13:15.058
before my tee time.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.125
Where do you play?

13:16.127 --> 13:19.127
Braemar Country Club.
Been a member for ten years.

13:19.129 --> 13:20.663
What do you carry?

13:20.665 --> 13:22.298
Titelist.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.832
What a piece!

13:23.834 --> 13:26.302
I don't even know
why I questioned you.

13:26.304 --> 13:28.170
Who cares
what kind of club he uses!?

13:28.172 --> 13:29.438
Relax honey,
it's just small talk.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.074
Well, don't!

13:32.076 --> 13:35.311
Maybe we should do this when you
have your eye on the ball...

13:35.313 --> 13:37.279
Or not on the ball. Whatever.

13:37.281 --> 13:39.816
Oh no, no. Better that we
know. The sooner the

13:39.818 --> 13:45.457
better. We have plenty of time,
my clubs are already in the car.

13:48.126 --> 13:51.260
I am in a tournament.
Made the top rung.

13:51.262 --> 13:53.795
I am one under par which
is good enough for third place.

13:53.797 --> 13:57.467
We're doctors. A couple
dentists... and uh, oh...

13:57.469 --> 14:00.736
one psychologist... but he
treats doctors... so it's under

14:00.738 --> 14:02.138
the rules.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.739
You're not putting that in me.

14:03.741 --> 14:06.509
This. Oh, don't fret.
It's just a teneculum.

14:06.511 --> 14:07.709
You'll hardly feel a thing...

14:07.711 --> 14:11.380
more like a pinch. And then
quick snip-snip and I'm on the

14:11.382 --> 14:12.881
first tee.

14:12.883 --> 14:16.318
Sorry. I'm feeling
a little anxious.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.788
- Oh.
- Really nauseous.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.790
It's perfectly
normal. Just relax.

14:21.792 --> 14:26.130
Breathe deep. And count
backwards from 18 holes.

14:26.531 --> 14:31.070
Wait..Did you say 18 holes..

14:35.305 --> 14:39.509
No, relax. I got it. C'mon.
You feisty little fibroid.

14:39.511 --> 14:40.775
Get out of there.

14:40.777 --> 14:43.246
Hey, hey, got it. Wait.

14:48.319 --> 14:53.222
PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE.
No, no, no!

15:07.438 --> 15:13.445
PLEASE! NO. PLEASE!

15:54.285 --> 15:55.318
What, honey, what?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.586
Honey, honey, I'm here.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.353
It's okay, it's me.

15:58.355 --> 16:00.791
You're just
having a nightmare.

16:03.261 --> 16:05.595
- Oh my God.
- It's okay.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.862
How long was I out for?

16:07.864 --> 16:09.700
I don't know.
Two uh, two hours.

16:11.002 --> 16:14.403
Michael it was horrible...
there was so much blood...

16:14.405 --> 16:18.441
Doctor Sandler said
everything was fine.

16:18.443 --> 16:21.811
Are you sure?
What about the biopsy?

16:21.813 --> 16:24.746
It was a
benign uterine cyst.

16:24.748 --> 16:27.683
It's grown kind of large so they
are gonna run a few more tests

16:27.685 --> 16:30.285
but...

16:30.287 --> 16:31.886
What's wrong sweetie?

16:31.888 --> 16:34.856
I don't know.

16:34.858 --> 16:37.659
Something's
not right I can feel it.

16:37.661 --> 16:40.596
No. no, I promise, ok?

16:40.598 --> 16:42.731
Dr. Sandler said the
cyst can be safely be removed

16:42.733 --> 16:43.899
through a
Caesarean.

16:43.901 --> 16:45.900
You're just having
pregnancy paranoia.

16:45.902 --> 16:47.502
A Caesarean?

16:47.504 --> 16:51.039
Yeah, Caesarean is
safer because of the cyst.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.775
It's gonna be fine,
sweetie, okay? Promise.

16:53.777 --> 16:55.343
Come here sweetheart.

16:55.345 --> 16:56.912
- Just get back in bed, alright?
- Can you lay with me?

16:56.914 --> 16:59.451
Yes, of course.

17:06.290 --> 17:09.760
Oh, you're so strong, Robin.

17:19.536 --> 17:22.940
Now carefully lift it out.
Watch the fingers.

17:27.811 --> 17:31.250
I'm hearing nothing,
take a look at her kidneys.

17:36.754 --> 17:39.955
I've updated all her social media.
She decided to give it

17:39.957 --> 17:42.561
all up and move to Costa Rica.

17:44.961 --> 17:49.098
MICHAEL! Is that you?

17:49.100 --> 17:52.601
Hey. What're you doing up?

17:52.603 --> 17:53.803
What're you eating?

17:53.805 --> 17:55.103
Don't change the subject.

17:55.105 --> 17:56.171
What subject?

17:56.173 --> 17:58.841
It's two forty-seven
am in the morning, Michael.

17:58.843 --> 18:00.075
Honey, I had a late meeting.

18:00.077 --> 18:03.478
Bullshit.
You're always coming home late.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.782
We're married, remember?

18:06.784 --> 18:08.717
What, do you
think I'm ugly and fat?

18:08.719 --> 18:10.852
No, no, God, no.

18:10.854 --> 18:11.787
Are you cheating on me?

18:11.789 --> 18:14.759
Oh my god, we
just had a quick dinner after.

18:15.759 --> 18:17.692
Quickie, huh?

18:17.694 --> 18:19.495
Honey, my job is social.

18:19.497 --> 18:22.997
Ok, half the deals I close
it's over dinner and drinks.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.900
What restaurant is open
at 2 am in the morning

18:25.902 --> 18:26.201
Michael?

18:26.203 --> 18:27.402
Norms?

18:27.404 --> 18:29.871
Does it serve perfume? Cause
that's what you smell like.

18:29.873 --> 18:33.575
Oh, my God, Robin, I probably
hugged a client at work.

18:33.577 --> 18:35.143
- You think I buy this bullshit?
- Okay.

18:35.145 --> 18:36.879
I'm not gonna
get dragged into this.

18:36.881 --> 18:38.813
Okay, you wanted the pregnancy.

18:38.815 --> 18:42.016
I know it's tough, but
don't put that bullshit on me.

18:42.018 --> 18:45.420
- Where are you going?
- To bed?

18:45.422 --> 18:47.422
You can fuck the whole
neighborhood Michael

18:47.424 --> 18:48.490
and I wouldn't care.

18:48.492 --> 18:51.362
Not gonna get dragged
into your drama tonight Robin.

19:00.171 --> 19:03.005
The last thing I want
to do is push him away.

19:03.007 --> 19:04.206
Michael's my
high school sweetheart.

19:04.208 --> 19:07.509
We're supposed to have two
kids, a boy and a girl, and grow

19:07.511 --> 19:09.678
old together.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.948
I don't want to be divorced
and broke and a single mom.

19:12.950 --> 19:17.389
That would be awful.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.588
I'm sorry, no offense.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.924
None taken.
Sometimes it does suck.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.592
Almost as much as it was being
married to Nick the prick.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.762
Guys get kinda crazy
around pregnant women.

19:26.764 --> 19:29.598
It's like they know they're
about to become the second most

19:29.600 --> 19:32.834
important things in
our lives... because they are.

19:32.836 --> 19:37.773
- It's not just that.
- Okay. Give.

19:37.775 --> 19:42.076
Michael came home a few months
ago smelling like perfume.

19:42.078 --> 19:45.214
So what do you think?
That he's banging his secretary?

19:45.216 --> 19:47.082
- You don't know that.
- Well I asked him about it

19:47.084 --> 19:49.784
and he said
that he hugged a client at work.

19:49.786 --> 19:51.821
Oh my God, and you bought that?!

19:51.823 --> 19:53.855
Are you high?

19:53.857 --> 19:56.958
He's probably banging some young
babe, without stretch marks on

19:56.960 --> 19:59.093
her ass and cellulite.

19:59.095 --> 20:01.796
It's what they all do when our
vaginas get stretched out like a

20:01.798 --> 20:04.033
strawberry fruit roll.

20:04.035 --> 20:05.200
Alright, ladies.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.901
One turkey with everything.

20:06.903 --> 20:12.207
And for you, madame,
one labor inducing pizza deluxe.

20:12.209 --> 20:13.409
Does it work?

20:13.411 --> 20:15.076
Absolutely! Five women have
gone into labor after eating

20:15.078 --> 20:16.111
that Pregnancy Pizza.

20:16.113 --> 20:17.079
- Really.
- Yeah.

20:17.081 --> 20:18.613
Ever since that
newspaper article came out

20:18.615 --> 20:20.114
we've been
flooded like this every day.

20:20.116 --> 20:22.985
This pie better work. She's
nine months, with couple weeks

20:22.987 --> 20:24.152
to go.

20:24.154 --> 20:27.188
We need your magic pizza
to work like a Slip-and-Slide.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.624
What's on this
miracle preggo pizza, anyway?

20:29.626 --> 20:33.595
Uh, anchovies, pineapple,
Gorgonzola, snails, and tons of

20:33.597 --> 20:36.834
garlic. So...
Bon appetit!

20:38.199 --> 20:39.133
If that doesn't get
the baby out, nothing will.

20:39.135 --> 20:41.070
You know, Michael's not
the Casanova type.

20:41.072 --> 20:43.138
He barely even
glances at other women.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.640
Robin, they're
ALL the type.

20:45.642 --> 20:48.511
God, I feel
like a fat tub of lard.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.146
I almost wouldn't blame 'em.

20:51.148 --> 20:53.681
Is Michael
still stirring the stew?

20:53.683 --> 20:57.151
You know,
churning the butter.

20:57.153 --> 20:58.219
Is he FUCKING YOU!?

20:58.221 --> 21:01.156
Shhhhhh!

21:01.158 --> 21:03.258
Nick wouldn't have sex with
me after he got me pregnant.

21:03.260 --> 21:06.896
He thought his pathetic
dick was going to hurt the baby.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.663
And then he went out for
chalupa and never came back.

21:08.665 --> 21:10.865
That was fun.

21:10.867 --> 21:11.766
I'm sorry Nick split.

21:11.768 --> 21:14.602
Don't be. I'm over
that cheating asshole

21:14.604 --> 21:16.671
piece of trash loser.

21:16.673 --> 21:19.073
I got Jason
and that's all I care about.

21:19.075 --> 21:21.209
Maybe it's all I ever
wanted... you know?

21:21.211 --> 21:25.281
That and someone to
take out the trash.

21:25.283 --> 21:27.115
You keep wolfing that down and
your baby's gonna look like

21:27.117 --> 21:30.654
Kim Kardashian's ass.

21:31.956 --> 21:34.122
What is it. You got gas?

21:34.124 --> 21:35.925
Oh my God,
you're bleeding!

21:35.927 --> 21:37.860
Holy crap. Waiter!

21:37.862 --> 21:38.894
What can I get youse?

21:38.896 --> 21:41.729
A... fucking ambulance.
Look what your pizza did!

21:41.731 --> 21:43.732
Oh my God!

21:43.734 --> 21:45.700
We have another one!

21:45.702 --> 21:47.969
This is crazy! My God!

21:47.971 --> 21:50.573
This is crazy.
Did you guys want your check?

21:50.575 --> 21:51.940
Yeah, you think?

21:51.942 --> 21:54.144
And a doggie bag?

22:14.364 --> 22:17.232
Okay,
let's get this party started.

22:17.234 --> 22:18.766
Good morning, little lady.

22:18.768 --> 22:20.302
How's our
mommy doing this morning?

22:20.304 --> 22:21.736
Am I going to lose my baby?!

22:21.738 --> 22:23.205
Oh, No, no...
everything's fine.

22:23.207 --> 22:26.240
Just relax and breathe
normally and you will be asleep

22:26.242 --> 22:28.377
shortly.

22:28.379 --> 22:30.111
Ok.

22:30.113 --> 22:31.846
I remember you.

22:31.848 --> 22:35.083
Now we take a nice
deep breath and we count

22:35.085 --> 22:37.252
backwards from 100.
Okay, sweetie? Good.

22:37.254 --> 22:48.263
My baby.
99... 98... 97... 9...

22:48.265 --> 22:51.102
Scalpel.

22:53.103 --> 22:55.273
Uh-huh-huh.

22:57.408 --> 22:59.209
Let's open her up.

23:00.276 --> 23:01.275
Here we go.

23:01.277 --> 23:02.811
- Got it.
- Keep it on the side.

23:02.813 --> 23:04.213
- You got it?
- Mhm.

23:04.215 --> 23:07.115
Alright, here we go.
Hey! Happy birthday

23:07.117 --> 23:08.417
little girl!

23:08.419 --> 23:12.257
Let's get ugh,
the scissors in here.

23:13.056 --> 23:16.227
Ok.

23:17.260 --> 23:22.831
Uhh... noting a small tear
in her anterior uterine caused

23:22.833 --> 23:24.299
by the fibroid.

23:24.301 --> 23:26.101
Lucky we got her here in time.

23:26.103 --> 23:28.974
Alright, let's get
this cyst out of here.

23:29.305 --> 23:30.805
Ah!

23:30.807 --> 23:31.372
Ow!

23:31.374 --> 23:32.306
What is it?

23:32.308 --> 23:34.810
Well, something jabbed me.

23:34.812 --> 23:38.746
I'm going to re-sterilize.
Take out the placenta.

23:38.748 --> 23:40.785
Yes, doctor.

23:42.687 --> 23:45.454
That's weird. It looks
like its been eaten.

23:45.456 --> 23:47.892
Yeah. What the fuck.

23:51.228 --> 23:54.329
Alright, lets get out this
fibroid cyst and stitch our girl

23:54.331 --> 23:55.997
up.

24:07.077 --> 24:09.111
REALLY?

24:09.113 --> 24:11.013
It... moved.

24:11.015 --> 24:13.948
It can't move, it's a
cyst for Christ's sakes!

24:13.950 --> 24:15.717
What is going
on here today?

24:15.719 --> 24:18.352
I'm telling you, it moved.

24:18.354 --> 24:20.354
Ashley,
gather yourself.

24:20.356 --> 24:22.760
Take a... breather.

24:22.959 --> 24:25.829
Alright
let's close her up.

24:33.970 --> 24:34.602
I'm sorry...

24:34.604 --> 24:37.171
Look. Just take the cyst.

24:37.173 --> 24:38.506
And the placenta.

24:38.508 --> 24:42.009
And go and
get it biposied at the lab.

24:42.011 --> 24:44.379
Yeah. Wow.

24:44.381 --> 24:49.019
Where'd they find
this one? Trump University?

24:50.386 --> 24:53.090
Asshole.

25:06.237 --> 25:08.803
Helloooo Ashley.

25:08.805 --> 25:10.973
Here.

25:10.975 --> 25:13.175
You can let go now.

25:13.177 --> 25:16.245
- Take it.
- What do we got here?

25:16.247 --> 25:18.983
It's heavy.

25:21.418 --> 25:24.386
This is the Moby
Dick of all cysts!

25:24.388 --> 25:26.021
Oooof.

25:26.023 --> 25:28.457
We had one of these in med
school and when we cut it open

25:28.459 --> 25:30.525
we found teeth
and hair and shit inside.

25:30.527 --> 25:31.726
It was fucking crazy.

25:31.728 --> 25:34.028
We dressed up like the mascot
and brought it to the football

25:34.030 --> 25:35.464
games.

25:35.466 --> 25:36.131
That's nice.

25:36.133 --> 25:37.999
Woah, woah, woah... wait wait!

25:38.001 --> 25:41.303
Why so... why so glum blue
eyes? Can Manny help?

25:41.305 --> 25:43.572
No, Manny,
I'm not in the mood.

25:43.574 --> 25:47.575
Oh. You poor baby.

25:47.577 --> 25:50.078
What's the matter?
You wanna sit on my lap?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.947
Tell me anywhere it hurts?

25:51.949 --> 25:55.417
I could rub it...
Give it a kiss.

25:55.419 --> 26:00.054
I know what you're doing
and that's not going to work.

26:00.056 --> 26:02.024
- Awww.
- It was a one time deal.

26:02.026 --> 26:06.261
Now you're hurting my feelings.
And it was just my birthday.

26:06.263 --> 26:07.929
You said that last month.

26:07.931 --> 26:10.865
I did? Come on,
don't be that way.

26:10.867 --> 26:13.201
I know you liked it.

26:13.203 --> 26:16.170
Isn't that sexual harassment?

26:16.172 --> 26:21.142
It might be, but...
fuck it. I don't care.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.346
C'mon.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.580
- Oh.
- What?

26:24.582 --> 26:28.050
Oh, I can smell your burrito.

26:28.052 --> 26:32.621
Manny's got a big
fat burrito for you.

26:32.623 --> 26:36.958
Those beautiful eyes
are saying, "Yes, Manny, yes!"

26:36.960 --> 26:38.493
You're gonna get me fired.

26:38.495 --> 26:41.362
No baby. Come on... Come on baby.

26:41.364 --> 26:47.535
It's just you and
me and a few tumors.

26:47.537 --> 26:49.504
You say that to
all the girls, don't you?

26:49.506 --> 26:53.876
No. Only you. I told you.
You're my special thing.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.576
C'mon baby.

26:55.578 --> 26:57.512
Wanna do it for Manny?

26:57.514 --> 26:58.647
Okay.

26:58.649 --> 27:01.518
Yeah. Mmm.

27:04.153 --> 27:05.987
Yeah.

27:05.989 --> 27:07.522
Oh, yeah girl.

27:07.524 --> 27:10.092
Oof.

27:10.094 --> 27:12.261
- Damn.
- But.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.161
You better be fast.

27:14.163 --> 27:17.232
Oh, I'm gonna be fast girl.

27:17.234 --> 27:18.566
Ooof!

27:18.568 --> 27:21.171
Mmm... Baby!

27:24.240 --> 27:27.376
I'ma be fast!
Show you how Manny do baby.

27:27.378 --> 27:29.277
Show you how to do it.

27:31.949 --> 27:35.316
Gonna get in this
pussy and stay in this pussy.

27:37.621 --> 27:40.188
- Fuck!

27:40.190 --> 27:41.689
Just fuck me, Manny!

27:41.691 --> 27:45.326

loan to set up shop in this

27:45.328 --> 27:46.294

27:50.934 --> 27:54.535
I'mma run for
Congress... Ah shit!

27:54.537 --> 27:55.470
[SNARLING SOUND EFFECTS CONTINUE

27:55.472 --> 27:59.675
I'mma open up
a school for disabled kids!

28:14.991 --> 28:17.261
Manny?

29:08.644 --> 29:09.444
Ow.

29:09.446 --> 29:12.781
Take it easy,
take it easy. Robin.

29:12.783 --> 29:14.248
You have stitches.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.784
- Is my baby alright?
- Yeah.

29:16.786 --> 29:19.720
Robin, just lie there and heal.

29:19.722 --> 29:22.726
Okay.

29:26.029 --> 29:27.696
Look, she's fine.

29:28.899 --> 29:32.536
Look, she's all cozy in her
little blanky in the nursery.

29:35.139 --> 29:37.339
She's beautiful.

29:37.341 --> 29:40.775
We made that.

29:40.777 --> 29:42.212
You and I.

29:43.413 --> 29:48.752
She's gorgeous, look at her.
With all her fingers and toes.

29:50.254 --> 29:52.187
Why did they take
her I want to hold her.

29:52.189 --> 29:54.089
I know.

29:54.091 --> 29:56.390
I know, honey. The doctors said
the fibroid absorbed some of

29:56.392 --> 29:59.061
her nutrients so, they
wouldn't let me hold her.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.696
And babies are routinely
separated from their mothers

30:01.698 --> 30:04.099
after Caesarean.

30:04.101 --> 30:05.600
Why?

30:05.602 --> 30:07.169
I don't know.

30:07.171 --> 30:09.737
The hospital policy.

30:09.739 --> 30:12.239
Just go to sleep, honey.
I promise you when you wake

30:12.241 --> 30:14.442
up, she'll be here okay?

30:14.444 --> 30:18.213
Hospital policies suck.

30:18.215 --> 30:23.521
It does, it sucks.
Go to sleep, baby.

30:25.488 --> 30:29.494
Samantha.

31:21.844 --> 31:23.410
Hey Megan.

31:23.412 --> 31:24.845
Hey Pete, what's up?

31:24.847 --> 31:28.118
Same shit, different baby.

31:53.376 --> 31:56.379
- See ya later.
- Bye.

32:36.652 --> 32:38.555
Oh, shit!

33:08.418 --> 33:11.889
See. Pete, these are the
ding-dings that run your world.

33:12.889 --> 33:17.594
Their fuckin' PhD's,
and BMW's, Mercedes,

33:17.893 --> 33:21.528
Hey Doc, can I borrow
the keys to your house...

33:21.530 --> 33:23.364
...piss in your fucking bed.

33:23.366 --> 33:24.932
Fuck your wife.

33:24.934 --> 33:26.900
What do you think?
You could watch?

33:26.902 --> 33:28.836
Maybe clean up the mess?

33:28.838 --> 33:31.706
I, actually, uh.
I'm pretty clean about marking

33:31.708 --> 33:33.908
my business.

33:52.062 --> 33:54.428
Hey Manny.
You owe me 50 bucks man.

33:54.430 --> 33:58.399
I told you the
Packers would kick ass.

33:59.436 --> 34:02.540
What the fuck.

34:07.544 --> 34:11.745
Ya hey. We got some crazy shit
happen down here in pathology.

34:11.746 --> 34:14.482
Hell if I know, man!
I'm just a damn janitor!

34:14.484 --> 34:16.650
It looks like Ebola got 'em and
they fuckin' 'blowed' up or

34:16.652 --> 34:18.353
somethin', man.

34:18.355 --> 34:20.989
It's like a human guts
pizza down here, man.

34:20.991 --> 34:25.362
Why don't you come
down and clean this shit.

34:41.976 --> 34:44.347
Look at that rack.

34:45.716 --> 34:46.980
You thinking what I am?

34:46.982 --> 34:50.719
- What?
- Terrorism?

34:50.721 --> 34:54.455
Jesus Christ.
Did you win that fucking badge?

34:54.456 --> 34:57.058
You really think terrorists
are attacking Shady Grove?

34:57.060 --> 34:59.127
I'm just saying...
you can't rule anything out.

34:59.129 --> 35:02.864
Yeah, well, let's not call
the Feds in just yet, ok?

35:02.866 --> 35:05.100
We got three dead bodies
in one night at the same

35:05.102 --> 35:06.100
hospital.

35:06.102 --> 35:08.703
I've never seen a
single homicide in Shady.

35:08.705 --> 35:10.605
This cannot be a coincidence.

35:10.607 --> 35:14.609
Okay well the lady in the
hatchery obviously slipped

35:14.611 --> 35:15.509
and hit her head.

35:15.511 --> 35:18.446
But this carnage in
here... this is....

35:18.448 --> 35:21.716
This is different.
This is... this is overkill.

35:21.718 --> 35:24.819
Oh, yeah.

35:24.821 --> 35:25.953
What do you
mean 'overkill'?

35:25.955 --> 35:28.790
Like when a jealous lover
chops off their partner's

35:28.792 --> 35:29.857
genitals.

35:29.859 --> 35:32.393
A mob hit when they
cut off a guy's johnson and

35:32.395 --> 35:34.929
stuff it in his mouth,
or pop out his eyes.

35:34.931 --> 35:37.665
- 'Columbian necktie, '...
- Hey excuse me.

35:37.667 --> 35:40.634
Can I go now, I gotta do my job
and trash this waste before it

35:40.636 --> 35:42.002
stinks to high heaven.

35:42.004 --> 35:43.571
Yeah, yeah, you can go.

35:43.573 --> 35:45.640
- Thank you.
- Don't go too far.

35:45.642 --> 35:47.040
Ah, wait a minute.

35:47.042 --> 35:50.812
Can you bring that here
and open that up please?

35:50.814 --> 35:52.147
Why?

35:52.149 --> 35:54.915
- Humor me.
- You sure?

35:54.917 --> 35:58.555
I can handle it.
Just open it up.

36:06.830 --> 36:08.996
See?

36:08.998 --> 36:11.065
Yeah. I don't hardly
smell it no more.

36:11.067 --> 36:12.801
It's like
perfume to me...

36:12.803 --> 36:16.737
Fine. Go back. Do your job.
But we may recall you.

36:16.739 --> 36:19.540
Whatever. That's fine. You
can recall me anytime you want

36:19.542 --> 36:21.074
- brother.
- Hey step off.

36:21.076 --> 36:22.944
I got nuthin' to hide.
I'm here every damn day.

36:22.946 --> 36:24.679
Seven days a week.
Haven't been on a vacation

36:24.681 --> 36:26.614
in nineteen years. Honest.

36:26.616 --> 36:29.750
I got three ex-wives and five
kids. I barely got enough money

36:29.752 --> 36:31.118
for toilet paper
to wipe my ass...

36:31.120 --> 36:34.188
That is fucking fantastic.
But we got work to do.

36:34.190 --> 36:36.824
Hey you know what...
I wasn't always a janitor,

36:36.826 --> 36:37.993
you know.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.228
I got a degree in electrical
engineering, taking night

36:39.230 --> 36:42.996
classes. But I look like a thug
you know so everyone is afraid

36:42.998 --> 36:44.498
to hire me.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.100
but I'm a
pussycat... really.

36:46.102 --> 36:47.734
Yeah, I got a few
things on my record sure,

36:47.736 --> 36:48.670
But I mean they
expunged that shit,

36:48.672 --> 36:52.176
'cause I was
young and stupid... ha-ha...

36:52.908 --> 36:56.944
Now it's work, work, work until
I take that last step into my

36:56.946 --> 36:58.913
cheap ply-wooden coffin.

36:58.915 --> 37:02.150
Have fun, boys.
See you in the morgue.

37:02.152 --> 37:04.886
La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la.

37:04.888 --> 37:08.522
- Gonna put a tail on that guy.
- Yeah.

37:08.524 --> 37:10.658
Alright, so what do you
think, we put out an APB?

37:10.660 --> 37:11.658
On who?

37:11.660 --> 37:14.127
Daffy fuckin' Duck?

37:14.129 --> 37:17.232
Answering a bunch of
stupid fuckin' questions, man.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.533
Why don't you ask my
girlfriends ex-boyfriend he's a

37:19.535 --> 37:21.536
puffed out fuckin' pussy.

37:21.538 --> 37:23.737
You guys could fuck
each other. Fuck away man.

37:23.739 --> 37:26.007
You think I hacked those
people up? You fuckin' crazy?

37:26.009 --> 37:28.710
You ask me a bunch of stupid
questions. I don't get paid

37:28.712 --> 37:31.279
enough for this shit.

37:44.828 --> 37:47.694
Fresh air.

37:47.696 --> 37:50.867
Hello trees. Hello birds.

37:51.701 --> 37:53.667
It's been two days honey.
You're not the Bird Man of

37:53.669 --> 37:56.039
- Alcatraz.
- Shh...

37:57.172 --> 38:00.908
Okay, we have a little
bump, here for the baby!

38:00.910 --> 38:04.078
No hands, baby's first
adrenaline rush, whoo!

38:04.080 --> 38:05.179
Sorry.

38:05.181 --> 38:06.980
She's so sleepy.

38:06.982 --> 38:08.850
Yeah, she had a long night.

38:08.852 --> 38:12.819
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm gonna leave you here.

38:12.821 --> 38:15.957
- There we go. One.
- Thanks, Daddy.

38:15.959 --> 38:18.893
Two... she's so sweet already.

38:18.895 --> 38:21.328
So polite.
I'm gonna go get the car.

38:21.330 --> 38:25.102
- Stay right here.
- Where else am I gonna go?

38:27.703 --> 38:29.971
- Michael.
- Yeah, honey?

38:29.973 --> 38:32.710
I love you.

38:34.210 --> 38:36.277
I love you too.

38:36.279 --> 38:39.583
You look beautiful.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.821
Hi.

39:04.707 --> 39:08.578
Ugh, ugh, ugh,
ugh, ugh, ugh!!!!!

39:14.250 --> 39:16.853
Is that
Mommy's little girl?

39:19.055 --> 39:20.388
Yes.

39:36.806 --> 39:40.375
- Oh, what a cute baby.
- Oh, please no.

39:40.377 --> 39:44.145
I had a baby once.
I traded it for a rock.

39:44.147 --> 39:48.049
But oh, what a night it was.
The Navy was in town.

39:48.051 --> 39:52.819
♪ ANCHORS AWAY MY
BOYS, ANCHORS AWAY!! ♪

39:52.821 --> 39:55.158
I'm ready for my
close up, Mr. Maplethorpe.

39:56.859 --> 39:58.792
My husband's gonna
be back any second.

39:58.794 --> 40:01.962
Oh, I had one a
husband too...

40:01.964 --> 40:04.399
lazy drunken bum!

40:04.401 --> 40:06.299
He died in his sleep.

40:06.301 --> 40:09.303
He chewed off his tongue
and he drowned in the blood.

40:09.305 --> 40:11.739
The cops said I poisoned him
but they couldn't, they couldn't

40:11.741 --> 40:12.906
make it stick.

40:12.908 --> 40:14.408
I'll tell you a secret.

40:14.410 --> 40:17.280
All in the hair tonic.

40:18.747 --> 40:21.049
Daddy's gonna make
this nice and quick.

40:21.051 --> 40:23.386
Put some more in the car.

40:24.053 --> 40:26.821
Half Mommy, half baby.

40:26.823 --> 40:29.357
It looks good. Alright!

40:34.698 --> 40:38.900
Hey, can you please
lend an old lady some money?

40:38.902 --> 40:41.335
Actually, I'm not gonna pay
you back so just give it to me.

40:41.337 --> 40:43.140
Whatever you got.

40:43.339 --> 40:45.909
This is... no... this is all I have.

40:47.377 --> 40:51.112
Wait a minute.
Thirty-three cents?

40:51.114 --> 40:54.482
You come out of a richy-rich
hospital where a Q-Tip costs

40:54.484 --> 40:57.417
a thousand dollars and all
you got is thirty three cents!!

40:57.419 --> 40:58.786
If you don't want
it you can give...

40:58.788 --> 41:02.159
Hey, don't you
touch my money, bitch!

41:07.330 --> 41:12.136
Don't want the gifts falling out
and be a bad dad. Done.

41:12.368 --> 41:14.938
I'm gonna cut
your head off like Isis.

42:05.955 --> 42:08.922
Michael, Michael.

42:08.924 --> 42:13.196
Wake up. There's
something staring at me.

42:13.529 --> 42:18.466
It's like a blob with a big eye.

42:18.468 --> 42:20.301
Is it a spider? I hate spiders.

42:20.303 --> 42:23.804
Michael, it is not spider.
It was bigger than a spider.

42:23.806 --> 42:26.873
It drooled all over the bed.

42:26.875 --> 42:29.976
Maybe it was Fluffy,
she misses her mommy.

42:29.978 --> 42:35.285
It was not Fluffy!
Was it fluffy?

42:35.951 --> 42:37.984
Whew, what is that smell, Robin!

42:37.986 --> 42:39.187
Jesus!

42:39.189 --> 42:40.288
Michael!

42:40.290 --> 42:41.455
Check under the bed, please!

42:41.457 --> 42:42.556
What is it?

42:49.098 --> 42:50.464
Oh my God!

42:50.466 --> 42:52.400
What is it?

42:52.402 --> 42:54.868
It's a dust ball
the size of a Fluffy!

42:54.870 --> 42:58.471
Come on, why
don't you believe me?

42:58.473 --> 43:02.946
Sweetheart, it was just a
nightmare, I'm right here, ok?

43:03.212 --> 43:06.080
- Okay.
- Just go back to sleep.

43:06.082 --> 43:12.453
I'll keep you safe,
from any gooey little thing.

43:12.455 --> 43:15.022
So real.

43:22.232 --> 43:27.234
Oh yes.

43:27.236 --> 43:29.906
That mommy's little girl.

43:31.341 --> 43:35.375
Shhh. Sleepy time for Samantha.

43:38.281 --> 43:40.584
And Mommy.

43:54.497 --> 43:56.263
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

44:10.546 --> 44:11.978
You look awful.

44:11.980 --> 44:13.614
Geez, thanks. Where's Jason?

44:13.616 --> 44:16.083
At the creep's. He gets
him for two days to act like

44:16.085 --> 44:17.451
he gives a shit.

44:17.453 --> 44:19.152
So, who's your friend?

44:19.154 --> 44:20.987
I'm a 'nandoula.'

44:20.989 --> 44:23.257
Did she just say Medusa?

44:23.259 --> 44:28.495
Do you see snakes in my hair?
No, no, my dear. I'm a nandoula.

44:28.497 --> 44:32.165
I take care of babies for new
mothers as a doula and then

44:32.167 --> 44:36.536
continue on as their nanny, if
they need me. Oh, and I'll

44:36.538 --> 44:40.440
just bet could use a
break from your wee one?

44:40.442 --> 44:43.143
Nope, I don't need a
break, thank you. Bye-bye.

44:43.145 --> 44:46.681
Oh, I love your
home. It's so... homey.

44:46.683 --> 44:49.116
She loves your home.

44:49.118 --> 44:50.551
Would you like a drink?

44:50.553 --> 44:53.254
No, I'm already
pumped. I went to the gym,

44:53.256 --> 44:56.556
Had a facial, and I had a green
juice with a coffee which is

44:56.558 --> 44:58.125
basically like a colonic.

44:58.127 --> 44:59.460
I was talking to your friend.

44:59.462 --> 45:01.629
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

45:01.631 --> 45:06.400
So where is
my little darling? Hmm?

45:06.402 --> 45:09.270
- Who?
- Samantha. She upstairs?

45:09.272 --> 45:12.540
Oh, I would just love to
take a little peek. Could I??

45:12.542 --> 45:14.475
I just put her down, I
don't want to wake her up.

45:14.477 --> 45:20.614
I'll be quiet as a church mouse.
She won't even know I'm there.

45:20.616 --> 45:21.714
Ah, up the stairs, to the...

45:21.716 --> 45:27.323
Oh, no, no, don't worry
my dear. I have baby-dar.

45:28.024 --> 45:31.125
Baby-dar? What did
she take, happy pills?

45:31.127 --> 45:32.493
What is she doing here?

45:32.495 --> 45:34.562
She's amazing, right?
I got her from a company

45:34.564 --> 45:38.732
called Tender Tots. Now you have
the freedom to do what you need.

45:38.734 --> 45:43.304
Like, go to yoga, have lunch
with your sister, get your nails

45:43.306 --> 45:44.638
- done.
- God, you sound

45:44.640 --> 45:45.873
like an infomercial.

45:45.875 --> 45:49.176
Seriously. You haven't separated
from Samantha for like a month

45:49.178 --> 45:51.011
since you brought her home.

45:51.013 --> 45:56.150
You need to take
a break, sis. Live a little.

45:56.152 --> 45:59.222
You look whipped.

46:06.796 --> 46:10.196
You are just
the sweetest little thing.

46:10.198 --> 46:13.266
Why don't we go for a walk.
We'll get you outside... we'll

46:13.268 --> 46:15.201
air you out a bit.

46:15.203 --> 46:17.203
I can't leave Samantha alone.

46:17.205 --> 46:19.607
She's not alone.

46:19.609 --> 46:23.277
Sara can watch her. She's a pro
and has A plus recommendations.

46:23.279 --> 46:33.187
Trust me.
She's in good hands.

46:33.189 --> 46:37.158
Oooh. Oopsie. My, my.

46:37.160 --> 46:42.228
Ooo. Someone's made a boo boo.
Yes, they did. They made a

46:42.230 --> 46:47.567
boo boo alright. Yes, they
have. Oh yes they have.

46:47.569 --> 46:50.170
Oh, you have just
an adorable little one.

46:50.172 --> 46:52.640
- Thank you.
- Needs a change though.

46:52.642 --> 46:56.076
- Oh, I'll do it.
- No wait. Please let me.

46:56.078 --> 46:59.245
- I love changing diapers.
- You do?

46:59.247 --> 47:01.449
Oh, yes I do.

47:01.451 --> 47:03.317
Sara, we're going for a
walk, will you keep an eye on

47:03.319 --> 47:04.250
Samantha for us please?

47:04.252 --> 47:05.786
Sure.

47:05.788 --> 47:07.487
I should give you
my cell phone number.

47:07.489 --> 47:11.826
No worries. I already have
your number on speed dial.

47:11.828 --> 47:13.663
- Really?
- Mhm.

47:15.730 --> 47:21.402
Okay, let's go.

47:21.404 --> 47:25.509
It's okay. Oh, oh, I'm s...

47:26.741 --> 47:29.643
See, isn't it nice
to get some exercise.

47:29.645 --> 47:31.681
And fresh air.

47:32.881 --> 47:35.384
Yeah, I guess.

47:36.886 --> 47:39.752
It's medical
marijuana. For stress.

47:39.754 --> 47:41.589
I thought you
weren't stressed.

47:41.591 --> 47:44.525
I'm not... anymore.
You should get a

47:44.527 --> 47:49.399
prescription. How do you think
moms deal with all this shit?

47:52.502 --> 47:53.500
I want you to have that.

47:53.502 --> 47:55.301
Holy crap.
Are you a drug dealer?

47:55.303 --> 47:57.370
Consider it a baby gift,
if you ever need it.

47:57.372 --> 47:59.473
This would take me
a year to get through.

47:59.475 --> 48:01.442
- Thank you but no thanks.
- Just take it.

48:42.417 --> 48:46.622
Uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

48:49.926 --> 48:55.431
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

48:55.830 --> 49:05.174
Yah! Uh, uh.

49:09.911 --> 49:13.614
Oh God. Here comes
Becky. I hate that bitch.

49:13.616 --> 49:15.552
Hi!

49:18.853 --> 49:21.487
We should go back.

49:21.489 --> 49:24.391
I can't. My endorphins
haven't kicked in yet.

49:24.393 --> 49:26.960
I'm having anxiety
being away from Samantha.

49:26.962 --> 49:31.699
Separation is good.
Teaches the child to... separate.

49:31.701 --> 49:34.335
- She's a month old.
- Speaking of separation,

49:34.337 --> 49:36.237
how's it going with Michael?

49:36.239 --> 49:39.540
I mean, he's out late, again.
But I think he's hinting about

49:39.542 --> 49:41.674
something big.
I think it's a promotion.

49:41.676 --> 49:45.545
That's great news! See,
I told you not to stress.

49:45.547 --> 49:49.283
I know... you're right.
I'm such a worry wart.

49:49.285 --> 49:51.685
You are a worry wart.

49:51.687 --> 49:55.825
- Can we please go back. Please?
- Ugh. Fine!

50:00.428 --> 50:01.895
You can't just leave that there.

50:01.897 --> 50:04.500
- It's free child care.
- It's gonna start a fire.

50:07.770 --> 50:11.371
We both checked her out!

50:20.915 --> 50:23.385
Oh drat.

50:27.422 --> 50:31.824
Oh, you. Someone
pooped their diaper again.

50:31.826 --> 50:35.962
Yes, they did.

50:55.017 --> 50:58.488
- Feel better?
- Yeah, a little.

50:59.555 --> 51:01.487
I feel better, too.

51:01.489 --> 51:05.527
It's 'cause you're high.

51:08.964 --> 51:12.736
Oh my God. Samantha!

51:17.973 --> 51:20.910
Holy shit.

51:26.982 --> 51:31.384
I knew I never should
have moved back to Shady Grove.

51:31.386 --> 51:36.493
Bad vibes. Bad vibes.

51:44.065 --> 51:46.567
Another case of overkill.

51:46.569 --> 51:48.801
You fuckin' idiot.

51:48.803 --> 51:51.971
Something Shady's
goin' on in Shady Grove.

51:51.973 --> 51:53.674
You have something to do?

51:53.676 --> 51:55.775
Yeah. I'm gonna
check the perimeter.

51:55.777 --> 52:00.417
Check. Yeah, yeah.
Take your time. Alright.

52:03.085 --> 52:06.018
So, I think that
takes care of everything.

52:06.020 --> 52:06.920
I think we're done.

52:06.922 --> 52:11.058
Is there, anything
else you wanna ask?

52:11.060 --> 52:14.027
It's been three hours. Do we
still have to keep going on?

52:14.029 --> 52:18.399
Thank both of you. She was
in a new place. She broke her

52:18.401 --> 52:22.935
glasses, ran into the hallway
and stumbled and tripped down

52:22.937 --> 52:25.038
the stairs.

52:25.040 --> 52:28.141
We found some pills in her purse
for high blood pressure so she

52:28.143 --> 52:31.547
probably just got dizzy
and lost her balance.

52:34.850 --> 52:37.484
I'll never forget the way
she looked just lying there.

52:37.486 --> 52:41.054
It's a sad fact, but a lot of
elderly people die from falling.

52:41.056 --> 52:43.056
These things happen.

52:43.058 --> 52:45.158
A least your baby's ok.

52:45.160 --> 52:48.828
Hey, whatever happened to
the murders at the hospital?

52:48.830 --> 52:52.165
Still investigating. And for the
next few days there might be

52:52.167 --> 52:55.502
some follow up whenever there's
a death, there's always tons of

52:55.504 --> 52:56.536
paperwork.

52:56.538 --> 52:58.772
Who's gonna notify her family?

52:58.774 --> 53:01.908
I will. At least
she had a full life.

53:01.910 --> 53:04.143
not like some of those baby
faced gangbangers I used to

53:04.145 --> 53:06.679
scrape off the
streets in East LA.

53:06.681 --> 53:10.150
You used to be a
detective in East LA?

53:10.152 --> 53:13.120
You must be really brave.

53:13.122 --> 53:16.790
No, not really. I worked
there for twelve years, dealing

53:16.792 --> 53:20.960
with those gang-banging punks.
Til my divorce and then I

53:20.962 --> 53:23.629
just couldn't take the stress
and the killings anymore so I

53:23.631 --> 53:24.832
transferred to Shady Grove.

53:24.834 --> 53:27.667
I'm divorced, too.

53:27.669 --> 53:34.107
Do you have a card incase
we think of anything else?

53:34.109 --> 53:41.817
Of course. Any questions,
anytime, about anything.

53:43.118 --> 53:46.118
- Anything at all.
- Thanks.

53:46.120 --> 53:49.091
Yeah, she will.

53:59.134 --> 54:02.201
Really? He is old
enough to be our gramps.

54:02.203 --> 54:04.937
I love a man in
uniform, besides

54:04.939 --> 54:06.707
I have Daddy
issues, you know that.

54:06.709 --> 54:08.509
How could you be thinkin'
about sex right now when your

54:08.511 --> 54:11.011
'nandoula' just
died in my house?

54:11.013 --> 54:13.779
I dunno, a distraction, maybe.

54:13.781 --> 54:16.216
I can't believe my nandoula is
dead. It's too depressing to

54:16.218 --> 54:17.986
digest.

54:18.654 --> 54:20.152
I am hungry though.

54:20.154 --> 54:23.223
Can you just stay until
Michael gets home please?

54:23.225 --> 54:28.198
Of course, sweetie. But I'm
not going near those stairs.

54:38.306 --> 54:42.145
So, uh, you get a
lot of tourists here?

54:43.779 --> 54:46.815
Uh. Uh.

54:51.986 --> 54:54.490
Score.

55:07.602 --> 55:09.969
Now, for a special
news report on Zika.

55:09.971 --> 55:13.339
Blood donations were halted...

55:18.948 --> 55:24.286
Must be hungrier than I thought.

55:31.125 --> 55:34.328
Meanwhile there is an urgent
and potential catastrophic

55:34.330 --> 55:36.996
decline in...

55:44.939 --> 55:46.772
Earlier this
month we reported...

55:46.774 --> 55:49.778
AHH!

55:58.786 --> 56:01.388
7300 pregnant women in the
continental US have already...

56:01.390 --> 56:03.092
Hm.

56:03.325 --> 56:05.859
...which is known to
cause severe birth defects.

56:05.861 --> 56:08.629
the Zika virus is spread by
mosquitos and by sex...

56:24.279 --> 56:26.149
What the fuck?

56:44.299 --> 56:47.270
Ugh, fucking cat.

56:49.303 --> 56:55.844
Fluffy. Come to mama,
you stupid fucking cat...

56:57.712 --> 57:00.946
You just scratched me, you shit.

57:00.948 --> 57:02.748
UGH!

57:02.750 --> 57:10.857
Stupid, fucking cat.

57:10.859 --> 57:12.859
My turn, you little fucker.

57:12.861 --> 57:14.828
Come out you mangy fur-ball!

57:14.830 --> 57:15.862
What are you doing?

57:15.864 --> 57:17.964
Your rabid cat just attacked me!

57:17.966 --> 57:20.766
That's impossible. Fluffy
ran away a couple weeks ago.

57:20.768 --> 57:23.170
Yeah, well she's back!

57:23.172 --> 57:27.010
- Are you ok?
- No, I'm not ok.

57:28.710 --> 57:31.344
- Look at my face!
- It's not that bad, Jane.

57:31.346 --> 57:35.385
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm gonna need plastic surgery.

57:37.051 --> 57:39.719
All I need now is rabies
and this'll be the end to a

57:39.721 --> 57:41.955
perfect fucking day!
I'm outta here.

57:41.957 --> 57:43.355
Can you just
stay a little longer?

57:43.357 --> 57:44.958
No, Michael will be home soon.

57:44.960 --> 57:47.460
- I'm sorry.
- Ok. It's not you...

57:47.462 --> 57:51.364
It's this place. It's like
the Amityville house for fuck's

57:51.366 --> 57:53.433
- sake.
- Well at least let me walk you

57:53.435 --> 57:55.268
- home.
- I live three blocks down.

57:55.270 --> 57:56.870
I'll be fine.

57:56.872 --> 58:00.172
- Hey Jane.
- Asshole!

58:00.174 --> 58:01.775
Do you even read
your text messages?

58:01.777 --> 58:03.877
Oh, my God.

58:03.879 --> 58:05.312
Hello to you, too, honey.

58:05.314 --> 58:06.446
My phone was off.

58:06.448 --> 58:08.781
Well it's kind of
important Michael.

58:08.783 --> 58:11.118
We have a baby, you
have to keep in touch.

58:11.120 --> 58:14.054
Somebody could get killed
and you wouldn't even know it!

58:14.056 --> 58:15.121
Are you alright?

58:15.123 --> 58:17.123
No, I'm not alright.

58:17.125 --> 58:21.027
It was horrible!...Jane
brought over a doula and she...

58:21.029 --> 58:22.228
A what?

58:22.230 --> 58:25.132
An expensive
English baby-sitter.

58:25.134 --> 58:27.199
Jane and I went on a
walk and when we came back the

58:27.201 --> 58:29.402
doula was dead.

58:29.404 --> 58:30.337
What do you mean, dead?!

58:30.339 --> 58:32.371
Dead, Michael as in
'dead' dead. She fell

58:32.373 --> 58:36.143
down the staircase.

58:36.145 --> 58:37.978
Are you joking?

58:37.980 --> 58:40.913
Why would I joke about
something like this?

58:40.915 --> 58:44.317
It was awful. The police came.
The detectives interviewed us

58:44.319 --> 58:46.920
for hours. We had to
make a statement.

58:46.922 --> 58:47.920
What do you mean a statement?

58:47.922 --> 58:50.422
A statement Michael,
are you even listening?

58:50.424 --> 58:53.493
Have you been drinking?

58:53.495 --> 58:56.228
I'm listening honey,
calm down. Please just go on.

58:56.230 --> 58:59.966
If you had returned any of my
calls you would've known.

58:59.968 --> 59:03.402
There's always something more
important with you Michael.

59:03.404 --> 59:06.239
You were even late
for our child's birth.

59:06.241 --> 59:10.310
That eh...
I am here now.

59:10.312 --> 59:11.478
So let's talk about it...

59:11.480 --> 59:15.915
We're doing this now. There's
never a good time for you.

59:15.917 --> 59:18.185
Where have you
been Michael? What is going on?

59:18.187 --> 59:21.054
A woman died in our home, Robin!
Isn't that more important?

59:21.056 --> 59:25.192
Don't change the subject!
You always do that.

59:25.194 --> 59:28.995
I'm not gonna
fight with you Robin.

59:28.997 --> 59:31.230
I need the truth, Michael!

59:31.232 --> 59:33.065
There is no 'truth.'

59:33.067 --> 59:37.239
Oh, really? Why
don't you try me.

59:38.040 --> 59:40.005
You really wanna
do this right now?

59:40.007 --> 59:42.475
Yes, I wanna do this right now.

59:42.477 --> 59:44.513
You can tell me anything.

01:00:03.899 --> 01:00:07.067
I'm seeing someone.

01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:10.303
I knew it. Who is she?

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:11.605
I always pictured
this going differently.

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:12.839
SPIT IT OUT!!!

01:00:12.841 --> 01:00:16.141
Robin, it all happened from the
pressure of the promotion and

01:00:16.143 --> 01:00:19.645
then, you know, the job and
you were having a baby and I

01:00:19.647 --> 01:00:22.982
just... I didn't know what to do.
And this didn't feel right!

01:00:22.984 --> 01:00:27.923
So I just... I'm gonna
spit it out. I'm gay.

01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:32.125
Come on Michael, stop joking.

01:00:32.127 --> 01:00:34.163
I'm serious.

01:00:35.529 --> 01:00:38.498
When did you turn gay,
this afternoon? We've been

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.933
dating since high
school! I would've noticed.

01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:44.004
No, you were always my best
friend, and... and... I guess I was

01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:45.605
in denial.

01:00:45.607 --> 01:00:46.839
I should have
never gotten married.

01:00:46.841 --> 01:00:51.411
I guess... I don't know I wasn't
ready to come out but I mean...

01:00:51.413 --> 01:00:53.179
I wanted to talk to you before
you got pregnant but you were

01:00:53.181 --> 01:00:56.650
so focused on having the baby
that there was never any time!

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.150
No, this is not happening!

01:00:58.152 --> 01:01:05.261
You're not gay!
We have SEX! We had sex!

01:01:07.194 --> 01:01:10.230
Oh my God are you gay?

01:01:10.232 --> 01:01:13.201
Neil Patrick Harris gay.

01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:21.308
Robin can't you say something?

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.976
Wow.

01:01:23.978 --> 01:01:26.578
I'm not a monster, I'm just gay.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.582
How could I have not noticed.

01:01:29.584 --> 01:01:32.085
Of course you're gay,
look at you!

01:01:32.087 --> 01:01:33.953
I... what?!

01:01:33.955 --> 01:01:36.623
I didn't even know for a long
time myself but that just...

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:38.357
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

01:01:38.359 --> 01:01:41.393
If you cared about Samantha
and me you would've told me

01:01:41.395 --> 01:01:44.663
BEFORE were MARRIED, BEFORE
we had a BABY... while we were

01:01:44.665 --> 01:01:45.699
TRYING!!

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:49.034
So, all of this... Is
this... Is this all a lie?!

01:01:49.036 --> 01:01:55.107
No, no, no it's not a lie!
Okay! I have always loved you!

01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:58.545
And I have always wanted a baby
too. for me and my partner to

01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:01.013
raise.

01:02:01.015 --> 01:02:05.417
When you say 'partner' you're
not talking about 'ME' are you?

01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:06.752
Are you?

01:02:06.754 --> 01:02:11.024
Randy, and I,
want to get married.

01:02:11.026 --> 01:02:15.694
Holy crap. You're leaving me
for a guy named Randy?!?

01:02:15.696 --> 01:02:18.297
You are the worst
piece of shit on Earth.

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:20.232
No, no, Robin!

01:02:20.234 --> 01:02:22.634
We can do this. We can all
raise Samantha together.

01:02:22.636 --> 01:02:25.404
You, me and Randy. We
can raise Samantha!

01:02:25.406 --> 01:02:27.473
Okay, one big happy family!

01:02:27.475 --> 01:02:29.708
Let's not throw the
baby out with the bath water!

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:31.745
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:35.248
Randy is a sweet guy, okay.
He's very nurturing.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.717
Nurturing!? I don't care if he
can breastfeed my child, he's

01:02:38.719 --> 01:02:40.487
never coming
NEAR my baby!

01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:42.154
- Get out! Get out!
- No, no!

01:02:42.156 --> 01:02:45.257
Samantha is my baby too!
Robin this is my house...

01:02:45.259 --> 01:02:47.292
Not anymore! Get out!

01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:49.328
Don't you want me to
be as God intended!?!

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.531
God doesn't give
a damn Michael, neither do I!!

01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.232
You know what, you'll be
hearing from my lawyer!

01:02:53.234 --> 01:02:56.169
- Oh, yeah!?
- Yeah!

01:02:56.171 --> 01:02:58.207
Bring it bitch!

01:03:08.216 --> 01:03:09.516
Oh, sweetheart.

01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:13.189
Hi, hi, hi.

01:03:14.656 --> 01:03:18.458
Oh, no. Did Daddy scare you?

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.694
Yeah? Oh.

01:03:21.696 --> 01:03:24.299
Oh yeah, I got you Samantha.

01:03:26.701 --> 01:03:29.405

Samantha?

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.565
Samantha!?

01:04:33.567 --> 01:04:35.370
Baby?

01:04:37.372 --> 01:04:39.241
Samantha!

01:04:46.147 --> 01:04:47.816
Baby!

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:51.719
Samantha!

01:04:59.326 --> 01:05:02.562
What the fuck?

01:05:20.814 --> 01:05:22.550
SAMANTHA?

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:26.788
Baby?

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.607
Baby!

01:05:45.439 --> 01:05:48.243
Mommy's coming.

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:50.913
Uh. Uh. Uh.

01:06:02.991 --> 01:06:04.924
BABY!

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:07.328
Baby.

01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:24.846
SAMANTHA!

01:06:27.015 --> 01:06:30.819
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:06:45.899 --> 01:06:47.435
Fluffy?

01:06:49.437 --> 01:06:51.607
Fluffy?! No!

01:06:53.942 --> 01:06:56.445
SAMANTHA!

01:07:28.343 --> 01:07:31.913
Ehhhhhh!

01:07:33.681 --> 01:07:35.750
Moooommaaa.

01:07:40.587 --> 01:07:44.627
Eeh.

01:07:57.971 --> 01:08:02.611
Hey, it's ok. It's ok!

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.984
Eeeh.

01:08:27.535 --> 01:08:29.638
Alright. Here we go.

01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:34.309
Should we ring the doorbell?

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:42.548
Oh. Wow.

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:45.017
She has, uhm. Let this place go.

01:08:45.019 --> 01:08:47.652
Probably to keep
you from wanting it.

01:08:47.654 --> 01:08:49.390
Don't start Randy.

01:08:54.629 --> 01:08:57.095
Where is everyone?

01:08:57.098 --> 01:08:59.432
Must be early?

01:08:59.434 --> 01:09:01.066
Yeah.

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:04.636
Oh God, who invited
Siegfried and Roy?

01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:05.837
I did.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.140
Why??

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.276
He's Samantha's father.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:11.542
For now. But you're still
in the middle of a custody

01:09:11.545 --> 01:09:12.712
battle.

01:09:12.714 --> 01:09:17.182
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Hey, you know I'm here for ya.

01:09:17.184 --> 01:09:21.685
- Come on.
- Oh gosh.

01:09:21.688 --> 01:09:24.156
Hi, ladies.

01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:25.857
Party's over.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:27.593
Doesn't appear to have started.

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:30.862
Excuse me. Who the fuck are you?

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:33.832
This is going well.

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:38.870
The trees are dying.
Let them. Trees just die.

01:09:38.872 --> 01:09:40.071
What's that, uhm, Robin?

01:09:40.073 --> 01:09:42.073
We already sang
happy birthday Michael.

01:09:42.076 --> 01:09:46.845
So why don't you take your
little boy toy here and... bye!

01:09:46.848 --> 01:09:50.048
Same old Jane.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:50.917
So where's the booze?

01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:53.689
It's in the kitchen.
Get it yourself.

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.658
So, how's it going with Bambi?

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:02.661
Randy... and it's great.
Thank you. For asking.

01:10:02.663 --> 01:10:05.166
Uhm. For Sammie. Here you go.
And that's for your kid.

01:10:08.102 --> 01:10:09.768
Whatever.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:13.105
Hi, little Jason! Hey,
buddy. Good to see you.

01:10:13.107 --> 01:10:16.776
Mommy's a
little cranky today.

01:10:16.778 --> 01:10:20.679
Hi, baby girl.
You tired, huh?

01:10:20.681 --> 01:10:22.013
Wow, you don't smell so good.

01:10:22.015 --> 01:10:24.749
Maybe we should
change you. You know?

01:10:24.751 --> 01:10:27.652
Come on, kick
those feet for Daddy. Good girl.

01:10:27.654 --> 01:10:32.661
Good girl.

01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:51.045
Oh!

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:59.118
I cannot believe this pigsty.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.152
When we were married,
she was a neat freak.

01:11:01.154 --> 01:11:02.954
You could eat off of surfaces.

01:11:02.956 --> 01:11:04.289
We could get Ebola.

01:11:04.291 --> 01:11:06.526
Pretty sure you don't
know how Ebola works.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.194
You never know.

01:11:08.196 --> 01:11:10.530
You're such a good girl.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:13.932
Mommy's dirty, I know.
What are you doing?

01:11:13.934 --> 01:11:16.035
Evidence.

01:11:16.037 --> 01:11:18.870
We need to get
some pictures for the hearing.

01:11:18.872 --> 01:11:21.240
You're a smart man.

01:11:21.242 --> 01:11:26.248
She's fuckin' lost it.

01:11:27.715 --> 01:11:30.182
- Leave it!
- No. The ants are gonna swarm.

01:11:30.184 --> 01:11:32.884
Ants are good.
They eat the leftovers.

01:11:32.886 --> 01:11:35.855
Hey, what the hell are you
talking about? You sound like a

01:11:35.857 --> 01:11:36.923
crazy person.

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:40.796
And you look like you're
homeless. Are you okay?

01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:46.298
- Have any weed?
- What?

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.201
Weed.

01:11:50.203 --> 01:11:54.209
Sure.

01:11:57.612 --> 01:12:02.582
Shh, shh, shh.

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.083
This place is disgusting.

01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:06.084
Let's put you away, baby girl.

01:12:06.086 --> 01:12:08.654
Yeah, let's get
some sleepy time.

01:12:08.656 --> 01:12:10.589
Daddy'll be
right back, okay?

01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:16.598
Daddy'll be right back.
Good girl. Good girl.

01:12:17.998 --> 01:12:20.600
At least we got something
out of the relationship.

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:21.801
Yeah?

01:12:21.803 --> 01:12:25.370
I figure Samantha's going to be
ours once we get custody.

01:12:25.372 --> 01:12:27.707
You really think the judge
is gonna give us custody

01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:29.008
over the mom?

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:32.744
Once he sees the photos
of this pigsty, he will.

01:12:34.948 --> 01:12:35.981
Oh, no.

01:12:35.983 --> 01:12:37.883
On second thoughts,

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:40.686
maybe we should just
grab her and make a run for it.

01:12:40.688 --> 01:12:42.288
I believe that's
called kidnapping.

01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:47.093
Happens all the time. We could
move to Rio, start a new life.

01:12:47.095 --> 01:12:49.794
- Rio de Janeiro?
- Do you know another Rio?

01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:51.364
The Rio Grande.

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:53.199
De Janeiro! De Janeiro.

01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:54.400
All right.

01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:03.178
- What was that?
- The fuck?

01:13:14.287 --> 01:13:16.722
It's coming from in there.

01:13:16.724 --> 01:13:19.859
It's probably a rodent of
some sort, like a huge rat.

01:13:19.861 --> 01:13:21.927
Oh, that's my old office.

01:13:21.929 --> 01:13:25.397
- It's locked. Let's go.
- No, hold on. Wait, Randy.

01:13:25.399 --> 01:13:28.100
- That's new.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

01:13:28.102 --> 01:13:30.869
For all we know, the crazy bird
might have a croc in there.

01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:32.972
What? What is that?

01:13:32.974 --> 01:13:35.141
- It's Big Jim.
- Where'd you get Big Jim?

01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:36.374
- Keister.
- Huh?

01:13:36.376 --> 01:13:38.744
- Prison pocket.
- Swamp monster.

01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:40.279
- Oh, sweetie.
- Joy pouch.

01:13:40.281 --> 01:13:42.048
- Joy po...
- Yeah.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.216
- I thought I was your joy pouch.
- Oh, you are.

01:13:44.218 --> 01:13:46.118
- Here, take it.
- Okay.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.120
- You're scaring me.
- Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

01:13:49.122 --> 01:13:51.856
- Hush those lips.
- So sweet.

01:13:54.295 --> 01:13:56.061
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:13:56.063 --> 01:14:01.232
- Got this.
- You got it.

01:14:02.903 --> 01:14:08.140
Oh. Ugh.

01:14:08.142 --> 01:14:10.276
Oh, holy cow.

01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:14.112
Does she keep the trash
in here? It smells like shit.

01:14:14.114 --> 01:14:16.781
- Literally.
- No kidding.

01:14:16.783 --> 01:14:21.352
Oh!

01:14:21.354 --> 01:14:22.887
This place is disgusting.

01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:28.994
Oh! Fucking rat.
I hate rats. They're so...

01:14:28.996 --> 01:14:31.062
ratty.

01:14:31.064 --> 01:14:33.199
Just a little jumpy.
It's okay.

01:14:33.201 --> 01:14:38.436
Let me get the light.

01:14:38.438 --> 01:14:45.043
Oh, my God.

01:14:48.983 --> 01:14:52.852
She's completely lost it.

01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:54.520
Is that shit
in the corner?

01:14:54.522 --> 01:15:01.927
It smells like it.

01:15:01.929 --> 01:15:03.395
Oh. Oh!

01:15:03.397 --> 01:15:05.498
Oh!

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.705
Hey, check this out.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.779
I'm heading home.

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:23.382
Girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

01:15:23.384 --> 01:15:25.183
Okay, just do me a favor

01:15:25.185 --> 01:15:27.485
and don't say anything
to Michael about Samantha

01:15:27.487 --> 01:15:30.121
until the hearing on Monday.

01:15:30.123 --> 01:15:38.364
And take a
shower. Bye.

01:15:51.077 --> 01:15:54.081
Michael?

01:16:01.455 --> 01:16:05.457
Michael!

01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:10.465
Where are you?

01:16:18.605 --> 01:16:22.874
Cynthia?
Who the hell's Cynthia?

01:16:24.077 --> 01:16:27.445
- Filthy.
- That's disgusting.

01:16:27.447 --> 01:16:32.453
"Samantha, Cynthia, Mommy."

01:16:35.622 --> 01:16:37.522
Cynthia?

01:16:37.524 --> 01:16:49.901
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Fuck.

01:16:49.903 --> 01:16:52.036
She's lost it.

01:16:52.038 --> 01:16:57.442
"October 14. Cynthia
burped for the first time."

01:16:57.444 --> 01:17:01.045
"December 8. Samantha
and Cynthia are inseparable.

01:17:01.047 --> 01:17:05.651
They... love playing
with each other.

01:17:05.653 --> 01:17:09.320
February 21. Cynthia got
mad at Samantha today.

01:17:09.322 --> 01:17:12.124
She can get so jealous."

01:17:12.126 --> 01:17:13.926
What do you make of it?

01:17:13.928 --> 01:17:16.160
She's unhinged.

01:17:16.162 --> 01:17:18.396
I mean, I knew she was
having emotional problems,

01:17:18.398 --> 01:17:21.232
but this is...

01:17:21.234 --> 01:17:23.569
Oh, God, you're hot.

01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:28.577
Who's there?

01:17:29.109 --> 01:17:31.910
Let me get it.

01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:34.512
This isn't funny.
Open the door now.

01:17:34.514 --> 01:17:37.048
Michael.

01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:40.018
Holy Christ!
What the fuck is that?

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.423
What are you
doing in there?

01:17:44.425 --> 01:17:46.491
What... What difference
does it make, Robin?

01:17:46.493 --> 01:17:48.160
Open the door! I'm serious!

01:17:48.162 --> 01:17:50.963
You're upsetting her!

01:17:50.965 --> 01:17:55.034
Her? <i>I'm</i> upset, Robin!
Open the door now!

01:17:55.036 --> 01:17:58.036
Well, you wanted visitation?

01:17:58.038 --> 01:17:59.271
You've got it.

01:17:59.273 --> 01:18:01.240
We're gonna sue your ass!

01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:03.441
I thought we were
one happy family.

01:18:03.443 --> 01:18:08.513
Open the fucking door,
you lunatic, psycho bitch!

01:18:08.515 --> 01:18:13.619
Get it, Randy.

01:18:17.425 --> 01:18:21.226
What are you
gonna do with that?

01:18:21.228 --> 01:18:23.161
It sees itself in the mirror!

01:18:23.163 --> 01:18:25.563
Don't like the look of yourself,
do you, you ugly, disgusting

01:18:25.565 --> 01:18:26.597
blob?

01:18:26.599 --> 01:18:30.602
Get it, Randy! Get it!

01:18:30.604 --> 01:18:33.438
Careful!

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.406
Oh, baby, you're so hot.

01:18:35.408 --> 01:18:37.609
Get it, baby! Get it!

01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:42.246
- Left!
- I got it.

01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:58.696
Babe? Babe?

01:18:58.698 --> 01:19:03.634
Aaah! Get it off!
Get it off!

01:19:03.636 --> 01:19:05.637
Ack!

01:19:05.639 --> 01:19:10.645
It bit
my fucking ear off!

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:19.517
Oh! Oh.

01:19:19.519 --> 01:19:23.454
It's just a scratch.

01:19:23.456 --> 01:19:27.159
I'll see you in Rio.

01:19:27.161 --> 01:19:29.663
Randy? Randy.

01:19:31.665 --> 01:19:34.400
Randy.

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:39.407
God.

01:19:42.443 --> 01:19:44.276
That creature killed Randy.

01:19:44.278 --> 01:19:47.512
- Her name is Cynthia!
- Who is Cynthia?

01:19:47.514 --> 01:19:50.449
What are you doing?
Where did you get the gun?

01:19:50.451 --> 01:19:54.619
Jane gave it to me.
Step away from Cynthia!

01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:57.688
Honey. Careful where
you're pointing the gun.

01:19:57.690 --> 01:20:00.426
I'm not your honey!

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.694
You were gonna take Samantha
away from me, weren't you?

01:20:04.665 --> 01:20:06.498
- Cynthia!
- Aaah!

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.102
What are you talking about?

01:20:10.104 --> 01:20:11.703
Take it easy.
You're scaring her.

01:20:11.705 --> 01:20:17.508
Are you crazy, Robin?

01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:19.578
Did you like
your birthday cake, Cynthia?

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.713
Mm-hmm.

01:20:21.715 --> 01:20:23.147
Are you Mommy's little girl?

01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:24.048
Mommy.

01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:29.454
Michael, say hello...
to your daughter.

01:20:29.456 --> 01:20:31.123
Cynthia.

01:20:32.725 --> 01:20:37.628
She was in a cyst,
Michael. It was a twin.

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.731
The doctors were wrong.

01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:42.101
The cyst was removed.
It was incinerated.

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:44.203
It's not alive.

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:47.739
That... thing
is not my spawn.

01:20:47.741 --> 01:20:50.843
Don't be mean.
And say hi to your daughter.

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:53.811
That disgusting polyp
is not my daughter.

01:20:53.813 --> 01:20:55.780
Really?

01:20:55.782 --> 01:20:57.749
I think she looks
just like you.

01:20:57.751 --> 01:21:00.686
It needs to be destroyed,
Robin. Listen to me, okay?

01:21:00.688 --> 01:21:05.289
It killed Randy.
It is a monster.

01:21:05.291 --> 01:21:06.758
Okay?

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.262
Honey.

01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:13.798
Don't touch her! Please.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.401
Put the gun down,
Robin, or I'll kill it.

01:21:16.403 --> 01:21:18.736
- Put it down, Robin!
- Okay.

01:21:18.738 --> 01:21:22.076
Kick it!

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:35.122
Michael!

01:21:35.922 --> 01:21:39.126
Whoa!

01:21:43.496 --> 01:21:45.463
Don't you dare hurt her!

01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:48.834
- Cynthia.
- Michael? Listen to me!

01:21:48.836 --> 01:21:53.204
- Cynthia, come here.
- Cynthia?

01:21:53.206 --> 01:21:55.473
Cynthia? No. Come back.

01:21:55.475 --> 01:22:01.482
- Cynthia? Hide-and-go-seek.
- Michael, gently.

01:22:03.384 --> 01:22:07.418
- Cynthia?
- Aaah!

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:08.786
Yaaah! Ow!

01:22:08.788 --> 01:22:12.624
No, Cynthia!
Bad Cynthia, please!

01:22:12.626 --> 01:22:17.295
Ah!

01:22:17.297 --> 01:22:19.397
- Dada!
- Freak!

01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:29.374
Yaaah!

01:22:29.376 --> 01:22:37.649
Cynthia...
Michael let her go!

01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:42.657
Bad Cynthia.

01:22:43.857 --> 01:22:47.295
You little bitch!

01:23:22.696 --> 01:23:24.762
Cynthia?

01:23:24.764 --> 01:23:26.498
Mama.

01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:38.009
Oh, baby.

01:23:38.011 --> 01:23:42.313
Breathe, Cynthia, breathe!

01:23:42.315 --> 01:23:46.321
Michael!

01:23:56.563 --> 01:23:57.795
Bad Dada.

01:23:57.797 --> 01:23:59.800
Bad Dada.

01:24:20.888 --> 01:24:25.423
- I told you.
- I'm not even surprised.

01:24:31.098 --> 01:24:33.565
Robin. Please.

01:24:33.567 --> 01:24:34.999
That's close enough!

01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:37.502
No, no, Robin.
Come out of the car.

01:24:37.504 --> 01:24:40.038
Please, just come out
of the car so we can talk.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:40.972
About what?

01:24:40.974 --> 01:24:42.173
Want me to take the
gun out of her hand?

01:24:42.175 --> 01:24:46.378
I don't want you to put her
in some sort of freak show!

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.114
What freak show?
Nobody's going to the circus.

01:24:49.116 --> 01:24:52.049
Get back!
Don't come any closer!

01:24:52.051 --> 01:24:53.118
I'll shoot her!

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.387
All right, all right.
We're not coming any closer.

01:24:55.389 --> 01:24:59.624
Just put the gun away and come
out of the car so we can talk.

01:24:59.626 --> 01:25:03.128
I'm not going to let you
take her away from me!

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:05.062
She's my baby!

01:25:05.064 --> 01:25:06.897
What kind of shit
is she talking about?

01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:08.999
I don't know.

01:25:09.001 --> 01:25:11.402
Robin? Let go of me.
That's my sister!

01:25:11.404 --> 01:25:13.538
- Robin? My God. Are you okay?
- Whoa, whoa. Back up. Ma'am.

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.775
- Jane, get back!
- My God. She has a gun!

01:25:16.777 --> 01:25:20.044
Don't do anything crazy, okay?
Think about Samantha.

01:25:20.046 --> 01:25:21.946
Get off of me!
Get the fuck off of me!

01:25:21.948 --> 01:25:23.414
I need you to go across the
street and get out of

01:25:23.416 --> 01:25:25.049
- here, ma'am!
- Please, Robin!

01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:27.151
What the hell are you doing?

01:25:27.153 --> 01:25:29.387
Mommy loves you.

01:25:29.389 --> 01:25:33.624
- Put the gun down, please!
- It's not your fault, Cynthia.

01:25:33.626 --> 01:25:35.660
Listen to me.

01:25:35.662 --> 01:25:37.462
I need you.

01:25:37.464 --> 01:25:39.164
Samantha needs you.

01:25:39.166 --> 01:25:41.600
No!

01:25:41.602 --> 01:25:45.169
No!

01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:47.571
No!
Come on.

01:25:47.573 --> 01:25:54.681
Don't go there.

01:26:07.059 --> 01:26:09.593
That's a good girl, yeah.
Oh, please!

01:26:09.595 --> 01:26:14.901
Okay. I know.
That was a loud noise.

01:26:28.514 --> 01:26:32.717
Ugh. I hate
little creatures. Ugh.

01:26:32.719 --> 01:26:35.119
Oh, shit. I'm late
for my Brazilian.

01:26:35.121 --> 01:26:37.691
Can you watch the kiddos?
Yeah, I'll watch you.

01:26:50.237 --> 01:26:54.442
Bye.

01:27:07.787 --> 01:27:11.056
Jason, get the fuck out of my
way, you little shit stain.

01:27:11.058 --> 01:27:14.729
Fucking kids.

01:27:15.162 --> 01:27:16.861
Samantha,
you take one more step,

01:27:16.863 --> 01:27:22.870
I'm gonna rip off your
head and shit in the hole.

01:27:24.871 --> 01:27:30.808
Who the fuck are you?
