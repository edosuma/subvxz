WEBVTT

01:56.522 --> 02:00.859
What the fuck?
Oh, fuck!

02:00.892 --> 02:04.029
Baby, come on!
Wake up!

02:04.062 --> 02:07.466
Maddie, come on, baby.
Come on, please.

02:07.499 --> 02:09.401
Please, please
just wake up.

02:09.434 --> 02:12.071
Come on.
Come on, baby.

02:12.103 --> 02:15.073
Please, baby.
Just wake the fuck up.

02:15.107 --> 02:18.244
Baby, baby, listen to me.
Hey, baby.

02:18.276 --> 02:21.446
Come on!
Wake the fuck up!

02:21.480 --> 02:22.849
Baby!

02:40.465 --> 02:41.968
I wish
I could say that this story

02:42.000 --> 02:44.169
we're about to tell you
has a happy ending.

02:46.105 --> 02:48.374
But unfortunately,

02:48.406 --> 02:52.244
that's not gonna be the case.

02:52.278 --> 02:56.916
This is the kind of story
where everyone is to blame

02:56.948 --> 03:00.553
and no one is spared.

03:00.585 --> 03:03.822
Then again, they do say
that love conquers all.

03:05.958 --> 03:07.359
So maybe even death.

03:11.897 --> 03:15.901
All I'm fuckin' saying is,

03:15.935 --> 03:19.338
if I were
to fuckin' get married,

03:19.370 --> 03:20.571
she'd have to be the one.

03:20.606 --> 03:22.975
Bro, what the
fuck do you mean "the one"?

03:23.007 --> 03:24.208
Oh, wait.
That's right.

03:24.243 --> 03:26.512
'Cause you're in deep with her
father, who's your supplier.

03:26.544 --> 03:28.346
And the only way to save
your ass is to marry her!

03:28.380 --> 03:30.516
Yo, bro, hey, hey!
You're always mad corny, bro.

03:30.548 --> 03:32.017
Do you wanna hear
this shit or not?

03:32.050 --> 03:33.251
Okay, go on.

03:33.285 --> 03:34.853
You wanna fucking
go back and talk about

03:34.887 --> 03:36.389
all the fucking
redundant bullshit

03:36.422 --> 03:38.825
that we always talk about?
Sure.

03:38.857 --> 03:40.025
What the fuck
did I start?

03:40.059 --> 03:42.028
Bro, all I'm sayin' is...

03:42.060 --> 03:43.328
I do a lot of drugs, right?

03:43.362 --> 03:44.930
But I always,
always keep it leveled.

03:44.964 --> 03:46.299
Bro, I've
been meaning to ask you.

03:46.332 --> 03:47.465
How the fuck
do you do that shit?

03:47.499 --> 03:48.734
It's simple, man.
I'm tellin' you.

03:48.767 --> 03:51.304
You just gotta, you know, like,
switch your indulgences around.

03:51.337 --> 03:53.339
You know? And then,
at the absolute least,

03:53.371 --> 03:54.906
you gotta, you know,
take a few days off

03:54.940 --> 03:57.043
from whatever you got
yourself into last, you know?

03:57.076 --> 03:58.443
I mean, look, bro.

03:58.476 --> 04:02.447
At this moment, I got
access to so much shit

04:02.481 --> 04:04.250
that I can, you know,
stay fucked up, I don't know,

04:04.282 --> 04:06.318
seven days a week, 365!

04:06.351 --> 04:08.353
366, bro, if it's a leap year.

04:08.387 --> 04:09.555
- Fuck!
- And not catch an itch.

04:09.588 --> 04:10.489
You feel me?

04:10.523 --> 04:12.291
I really need
to fuckin' start doin' that.

04:12.323 --> 04:14.594
'Cause I think that I might
be addicted to coke, bro.

04:14.626 --> 04:16.963
- Like seriously.
- Yeah, no fucking shit, bro.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.964
You buy, like what,
like, fuckin' three ounces

04:18.998 --> 04:20.233
off of me each week?

04:20.265 --> 04:23.168
How the fuck do you even go
through that much shit anyways?

04:23.202 --> 04:27.273
Uh, I don't fuckin' know, yo.
It's kind of a fuckin' blur.

04:27.305 --> 04:30.276
I guess I just...
I party too hard.

04:30.308 --> 04:32.611
Yeah, yeah, well, try and
take it easy, man, all right?

04:32.644 --> 04:34.981
I don't wanna be losing
my little, best custy here.

04:35.014 --> 04:36.382
- I'm touched.
- Yeah.

04:36.414 --> 04:37.616
Look, bro, all I'm sayin' is...

04:37.649 --> 04:40.486
All right,
I do a lot of drugs, right?

04:40.519 --> 04:43.589
But, I keep it level.

04:43.622 --> 04:46.092
And, there's not
a lot of chicks out there

04:46.125 --> 04:48.127
who can, you know,

04:48.159 --> 04:51.496
hang on my shit
without becoming "unhinged."

04:51.529 --> 04:54.232
And by "unhinged" you mean
coked-out fucking drug whores?

04:54.265 --> 04:59.237
Yeah, yeah, basically, bro.
But you know, she can, man.

04:59.271 --> 05:01.207
And throughout the years,
you know, we've been through

05:01.240 --> 05:05.644
so much fuckin' shit together.

05:05.678 --> 05:08.047
Fuck, man.

05:08.079 --> 05:10.181
I think I actually
fucking love that girl.

05:30.101 --> 05:32.103
So how are things
going with Seven?

05:32.137 --> 05:33.305
Did you resolve
any of the issues

05:33.339 --> 05:35.341
you were having last week?

05:39.111 --> 05:43.014
Uh, no, actually.

05:43.048 --> 05:48.019
We had another
fight last night.

05:48.053 --> 05:51.123
A big one, it was, it was bad.

05:51.156 --> 05:55.094
What happened?

05:55.127 --> 05:58.998
It's what always happens.
Just Sev being Sev.

05:59.031 --> 06:00.466
Thanks.

06:03.569 --> 06:06.005
Max, arriving just in time, man.

06:06.038 --> 06:07.340
Ah, man,
I'm so glad to see you, man.

06:07.373 --> 06:08.541
What's up?
You good?

06:08.574 --> 06:09.542
Yeah.

06:09.575 --> 06:12.310
I'm gonna give you about,
like two for each.

06:12.344 --> 06:14.012
I'll put 'em
right where they wanna be

06:14.046 --> 06:15.147
for the next couple of hours.

06:15.180 --> 06:19.385
And then, you know, just
give me like two, whatever.

06:19.418 --> 06:20.653
- Word?
- Yeah.

06:20.685 --> 06:22.253
My man.

06:22.286 --> 06:24.556
Damn, dude.
You hear me?

06:24.589 --> 06:27.525
That's right, bro.
Aw, fuck, Ellis.

06:27.558 --> 06:29.195
- Oh, shit.
- You want me?

06:29.228 --> 06:30.696
She's a problem, man.

06:30.728 --> 06:34.300
- I'm Zhanna.
- Sev, pleasure is all mine.

06:50.315 --> 06:52.250
Ellis tells me
you have molly?

06:52.284 --> 06:55.221
Mm, Ellis talks a lot.

06:55.253 --> 06:59.624
But, uh, yes, I sure do.
It just depends on something.

06:59.658 --> 07:02.361
Oh, really?
And what does this depend on?

07:02.394 --> 07:06.365
Well, it depends on whether or
not you're gonna dance with me.

07:06.397 --> 07:09.200
Dance with you?

07:09.233 --> 07:10.769
- Yep.
- For real?

07:10.803 --> 07:13.639
Where the fuck
do you find these girls, Sev?

07:13.671 --> 07:14.906
Maddie, I wasn't...

07:14.940 --> 07:18.444
Fucking in a disgusting,
pissed covered club bathroom?

07:18.476 --> 07:19.611
Are you fuckin' serious?

07:19.644 --> 07:21.113
- Maddie, that's...
- Shut up, Seven!

07:21.146 --> 07:23.816
Shut up!
Was she the only one tonight?

07:23.849 --> 07:25.651
Huh?
Was it just the one?

07:25.683 --> 07:27.820
Or were there more of
your nasty, fuckin' drug whores?

07:27.853 --> 07:29.288
Baby, that's not
what was happening.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.722
- I fucking hate you, Seven!
- No, baby, stop!

07:30.755 --> 07:31.823
- I fucking hate you!
- Stop, stop!

07:31.856 --> 07:33.224
I hate you!
I hate you!

07:33.257 --> 07:35.293
I hate you!

07:35.327 --> 07:38.329
I hate you.

07:38.363 --> 07:39.697
Maddie, I fuckin' love you.

07:39.731 --> 07:41.267
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.369
You can't.

07:43.401 --> 07:48.373
You can't when you're constantly
doing these things to me.

07:48.406 --> 07:50.642
- Always.
- Maddie.

07:50.675 --> 07:52.844
Why do you always
do this to me?

07:52.877 --> 07:54.413
Why?

07:54.445 --> 07:56.147
Do you know
what this feels like?

07:56.180 --> 07:58.584
You hurt me.
You hurt me so fucking badly.

07:58.616 --> 08:00.151
All the time.
Why?

08:00.185 --> 08:01.420
Why do you
do these things to me?

08:01.452 --> 08:02.620
- Why?
- I don't know.

08:02.654 --> 08:05.257
- Why, why, why?
- Baby, I don't know.

08:05.289 --> 08:08.293
I don't know, all right.
I don't know.

08:08.327 --> 08:13.298
This is ruining me inside.
This is ruining me inside.

08:13.332 --> 08:15.634
I don't want
to hurt like this anymore!

08:15.666 --> 08:17.102
- I know.
- I don't want...

08:17.135 --> 08:18.503
I can't.
I can't take it.

08:18.536 --> 08:21.606
I can't.

08:21.639 --> 08:22.841
Then why do you stay?

08:25.409 --> 08:28.580
Because I fucking
love you, Seven.

08:30.781 --> 08:32.885
And I can't stop.

08:32.918 --> 08:35.820
And I wanna stop
so fuckin' badly.

08:35.853 --> 08:37.489
You don't even know.

08:37.522 --> 08:40.191
- But I can't.
- Maddie, Maddie...

08:40.224 --> 08:42.194
I can't 'cause you got me.
You fucking got me.

08:42.227 --> 08:45.865
- And all you do is hurt me.
- Maddie.

08:45.897 --> 08:47.432
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- Maddie, please.

08:47.465 --> 08:49.868
No, I'm fucking serious.
Don't fucking touch me.

09:07.585 --> 09:09.320
You don't think
he's taking advantage of you

09:09.353 --> 09:10.522
when he does
these things he does?

09:10.555 --> 09:12.724
No, no, it's not like that.
He doesn't...

09:12.757 --> 09:14.459
He doesn't
do that stuff to hurt me.

09:14.493 --> 09:16.929
He just, he can't, he can't
help himself, you know?

09:16.961 --> 09:18.396
He hates himself,

09:18.430 --> 09:21.367
so he's always trying
to do or feel something new.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.869
So that he can try and forget
about the horrible stuff

09:23.901 --> 09:26.906
he feels deep down
'cause of his brother.

09:26.939 --> 09:29.842
What happened with his brother?

09:33.512 --> 09:37.449
Well, um,

09:37.482 --> 09:38.751
there was this accident.

09:38.783 --> 09:41.553
- Mm-hm?
- A bad one.

09:41.586 --> 09:44.656
And his brother got hurt.

09:44.690 --> 09:48.826
So, his grandma kicked him out.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.930
He's been on his own
since he was 16,

09:50.963 --> 09:53.666
dealing with
all this shit all by himself.

09:53.699 --> 09:55.668
I mean, can you imagine
having no one?

09:57.669 --> 10:01.307
And he thinks it's all
his fault, but it's, it's not.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.774
It's his fucking dad's fault.

10:02.807 --> 10:04.409
That's whose
fucking fault it is.

10:04.443 --> 10:07.980
His dad is a piece of shit
who used to do fucked up stuff

10:08.012 --> 10:09.848
to him and like beat on him,

10:09.881 --> 10:12.384
and disappear
for weeks at a time.

10:12.416 --> 10:15.887
And, it was so bad that
they had to come and take him

10:15.921 --> 10:18.424
and his brother away and
send them to his grandma's.

10:18.456 --> 10:20.658
And then, fuck!
All that shit happened.

10:20.691 --> 10:22.894
And then, then he was alone.

10:25.696 --> 10:27.799
Now, he has me.

10:27.833 --> 10:31.337
And I have him.
So we're not alone anymore.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.470
And, yeah, I do realize

10:32.504 --> 10:35.240
that I sound like a complete
fucking psycho right now,

10:35.273 --> 10:37.308
but that's, that's all right.

10:37.342 --> 10:38.711
Not at all.

10:56.527 --> 11:00.800
Yeah, there I was,
alone and in pain.

11:03.801 --> 11:07.305
I couldn't really do
anything about the loneliness,

11:07.339 --> 11:10.441
but I sure knew
how to stop the pain.

11:10.474 --> 11:13.045
Yeah, the heroin.

11:13.078 --> 11:16.448
Bingo.
Yeah.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.448
As you already know,

11:17.482 --> 11:20.653
I ended up going
a little overboard with it.

11:22.554 --> 11:23.856
And trying to kick
an H addiction

11:23.888 --> 11:27.558
with no one around
is pretty up there.

11:27.592 --> 11:28.794
Mm.

11:32.930 --> 11:37.636
So that's why
I'm not leaving Seven.

11:37.669 --> 11:39.905
'Cause without him,
who knows where I'd be?

11:41.973 --> 11:42.974
I mean it's not like

11:43.007 --> 11:44.942
we were like really
good friends or anything.

11:44.975 --> 11:47.945
He was my fuckin' dealer
for fuck's sake.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.580
Your dealer?

11:49.613 --> 11:52.817
Yeah, my dealer.
My, um, my drug dealer.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.018
Oh.

11:54.051 --> 11:55.620
I mean, here I am,
some basically,

11:55.653 --> 11:59.624
some fuckin' H whore

11:59.657 --> 12:04.629
handing him over the remainder
of my student loan.

12:04.662 --> 12:07.832
And he decides to save me?
Like, what?

12:10.801 --> 12:12.704
He gave me back
all the money afterwards too,

12:12.738 --> 12:14.306
so I wouldn't be in debt.

12:18.377 --> 12:20.546
It's just I was so close.

12:20.579 --> 12:25.017
I was so fucking close
to losing myself, completely.

12:27.051 --> 12:31.089
And he pulled me back.

12:31.123 --> 12:35.127
Well, it does sound like
he was very kind to you.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.796
But you're attributing
all of your recovery to him.

12:37.829 --> 12:38.829
Don't get me wrong.

12:38.863 --> 12:41.099
I understand how important
it is to have support

12:41.132 --> 12:42.935
when you're facing
a challenge like that.

12:42.968 --> 12:45.603
But don't you think you might've
had something to do with it?

12:45.637 --> 12:47.906
No.
No.

12:47.939 --> 12:49.942
Madeline, I think
you deserve a lot of credit.

12:49.974 --> 12:51.576
You've clearly
been through so much.

12:51.609 --> 12:52.777
- I mean you...
- No, no.

12:52.810 --> 12:55.381
You don't get it.
He almost died.

12:55.414 --> 12:56.382
I had no place to live.

12:56.415 --> 12:58.851
My loan wouldn't
cover a place and my habit.

12:58.883 --> 13:00.952
So what do you think I chose?

13:00.985 --> 13:03.454
And when he saw that
I didn't have a place to live

13:03.488 --> 13:04.656
he let me stay with him.

13:04.689 --> 13:07.993
And then,
when he realized how bad I was,

13:08.026 --> 13:09.127
he tried getting me to stop.

13:09.161 --> 13:14.166
And boy, let me tell you,
that did not go over well.

13:14.199 --> 13:16.469
So he started doing it with me.

13:18.903 --> 13:21.038
Like whenever
I would slam, he would too.

13:21.071 --> 13:22.874
So if I wanted
to fuck myself up,

13:22.907 --> 13:25.810
I'd have to fuck him up also.

13:25.844 --> 13:29.415
See, I had a pretty sweet
tolerance at that point,

13:29.448 --> 13:31.517
and he didn't.

13:31.550 --> 13:35.788
And it took him
fucking OD'ing on me

13:35.820 --> 13:36.988
for me to realize,

13:37.022 --> 13:38.791
you know, "Wow,
this guy actually, really

13:38.824 --> 13:40.526
fucking cares about you, Maddie.

13:40.559 --> 13:41.560
And he's the only one that does.

13:41.594 --> 13:46.464
And he's gonna fucking die
if you don't stop."

13:46.498 --> 13:49.066
So I did.

13:49.099 --> 13:52.637
And we went through
withdrawal together, you know?

13:52.671 --> 13:56.809
Oh.

13:58.877 --> 14:01.579
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

14:01.613 --> 14:04.616
Don't be sorry.

14:04.648 --> 14:07.852
It's perfectly fine, Madeline.

14:07.886 --> 14:10.488
Hey, that rhymed.

14:10.522 --> 14:11.723
That did too.

14:15.860 --> 14:20.832
God, maybe I'm being selfish
tryin' to change him,

14:20.866 --> 14:22.868
getting mad at him like this.

14:22.901 --> 14:26.905
'Cause that's just who he is.
He's never tried to change me.

14:26.938 --> 14:29.975
Well, besides the Heavy.

14:30.007 --> 14:32.877
And I think we can agree
that that was for the best.

14:36.714 --> 14:40.786
Madeline, I'm so sorry
you've been through all this.

14:40.819 --> 14:44.122
I just want to thank you
for prying that out of me.

14:44.155 --> 14:47.659
I don't know.
I feel so much...

14:47.691 --> 14:51.129
I guess, lighter,
after having said all that.

14:53.164 --> 14:55.267
Thank you
for sharing your story with me.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.401
It's clear to me that he's

14:56.435 --> 14:58.637
an extremely important
part of your life, and as such,

14:58.670 --> 15:00.939
he's a very important
part of helping you.

15:00.972 --> 15:03.175
Not to get you back, but...

15:03.208 --> 15:06.812
In order to get you back
into the swing of things,

15:06.844 --> 15:11.583
we need to get get you
comfortable and secure with him.

15:11.616 --> 15:13.552
Fuck, Seven!
Seven?

15:13.584 --> 15:16.754
Hey!
Hey, come here.

15:16.787 --> 15:18.789
Seven, come on.
Wake up, baby.

15:18.823 --> 15:21.226
Come on.
Come here.

15:21.258 --> 15:23.829
Yeah, it's me.
It's me, all right?

15:23.862 --> 15:26.565
Okay, I need you
to help me out here, okay?

15:26.598 --> 15:28.166
Come on.
I need to get you in the shower.

15:28.199 --> 15:29.968
All right?

15:30.001 --> 15:32.571
I know, I know, I know, baby.

15:32.603 --> 15:34.006
It's okay.
I'm not mad anymore.

15:34.039 --> 15:36.174
I'm not mad anymore, but I
really need you to help me out.

15:36.206 --> 15:38.276
All right?
Okay?

15:38.310 --> 15:40.945
Okay?
Fuck!

15:50.655 --> 15:52.291
Come here.
Come here.

15:52.324 --> 15:55.260
Here, sniff, all right?
Sniff.

16:15.347 --> 16:17.283
Hey, doll.

16:21.353 --> 16:22.854
Hey.

16:27.791 --> 16:28.993
Tell me.

16:31.095 --> 16:34.599
I'm just...

16:34.632 --> 16:38.637
I'm just fucking
done with it all, man.

16:38.670 --> 16:41.106
All of what?
Doing drugs?

16:41.138 --> 16:46.110
No, no, no.
I love this shit.

16:46.143 --> 16:50.281
I'm talkin' about
all the other bullshit.

16:50.315 --> 16:52.785
Me being a piece
of shit to you, Maddie.

16:57.088 --> 17:00.858
Seriously, Madeline.

17:00.892 --> 17:03.195
I'm done hurting you.

17:03.228 --> 17:04.630
I'm fuckin' done.

17:09.133 --> 17:13.337
I don't care about
any of that shit anymore.

17:13.371 --> 17:14.907
Okay?

17:17.741 --> 17:19.877
I had a moment today
and I realized

17:19.911 --> 17:23.882
that I was wrong to expect
all that stuff of you.

17:25.950 --> 17:28.786
You are who you are.

17:28.819 --> 17:30.955
And I need to stop
being so fuckin' selfish

17:30.988 --> 17:35.160
and trying to change you.

17:35.192 --> 17:38.296
I know you love me.

17:38.328 --> 17:40.164
That's all that matters.

17:40.198 --> 17:43.401
Yeah, well...

17:43.434 --> 17:46.804
We're gonna start working
differently, all right?

17:46.837 --> 17:51.242
So now it's my turn
to stop my bullshit.

17:51.276 --> 17:52.777
Babe, if it weren't for you,

17:52.811 --> 17:56.882
I would've fuckin' checked
myself out a long time ago.

17:56.914 --> 18:01.886
- I mean after my brother's...
- No, don't.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.956
He's alive.
Okay?

18:04.988 --> 18:06.659
I'm sure that he's doin' fine.

18:09.193 --> 18:10.928
Bad things happened,
and you got dealt

18:10.961 --> 18:13.464
a really shitty hand
in the beginning, babe.

18:13.498 --> 18:14.966
But you stuck it out

18:14.998 --> 18:17.768
and you played your way
into something desirable.

18:17.802 --> 18:20.738
And you're actually
really fucking amazing.

18:20.771 --> 18:23.841
Yeah.

18:23.874 --> 18:25.142
You are.
You're fuckin' amazing!

18:25.176 --> 18:26.378
Hey!
Look at me.

18:26.411 --> 18:30.347
I'm serious.
I'm serious.

18:30.381 --> 18:33.951
If I were you...

18:33.985 --> 18:38.090
I'd probably be some kind of...

18:38.123 --> 18:41.359
- I don't know.
- What?

18:41.392 --> 18:44.395
- A demon or something.
- No, babe.

18:44.429 --> 18:47.899
- I would.
- No.

18:47.931 --> 18:51.469
You're still a total angel.

18:51.503 --> 18:53.271
Besides,

18:53.304 --> 18:57.142
you're gonna be
a famous actress one day, hm?

18:57.174 --> 18:58.442
How'd your audition go,
by the way?

18:58.476 --> 18:59.911
It was the one
with the network, right?

18:59.943 --> 19:02.947
Yeah.
It went really good I think.

19:02.980 --> 19:05.817
You're gonna be
on TV in no time.

19:13.892 --> 19:15.459
Really, huh?

19:15.492 --> 19:19.530
Mm, life is some shit, huh?

19:19.564 --> 19:22.534
Mm-hm.

19:22.566 --> 19:25.836
You think that
we're gonna make it?

19:25.870 --> 19:28.407
No, but we'll have fun trying.

19:31.875 --> 19:36.847
Truer words, doll.
Truer words.

19:36.881 --> 19:39.884
- Baby?
- Mm?

19:39.918 --> 19:41.386
How do you wanna die?

19:41.419 --> 19:43.188
There it is!

19:43.220 --> 19:45.089
I was wondering when you were
going to get all weird on me.

19:45.123 --> 19:46.290
Seven, shut up!
I'm being serious.

19:46.324 --> 19:47.491
Okay.

19:47.525 --> 19:50.528
- If you could choose.
- Hm?

19:50.562 --> 19:55.467
If I could choose I would
wanna die painlessly.

19:55.499 --> 19:57.401
And beautiful.

19:57.434 --> 19:59.837
And I wouldn't
wanna know I was dying.

19:59.871 --> 20:03.041
I would just want it
to happen, you know?

20:03.074 --> 20:08.046
Peacefully, just drift away
into the darkness.

20:08.078 --> 20:09.480
That does sound nice.

20:12.350 --> 20:14.319
- Your turn.
- My turn?

20:14.352 --> 20:15.519
Yeah.

20:15.553 --> 20:19.391
Balls deep inside of you.

20:19.423 --> 20:22.993
Oh, you're so gross!

21:57.521 --> 21:59.156
Fuck.

22:25.315 --> 22:26.483
Hey.
Where have you been?

22:26.517 --> 22:28.286
I'm having
some type of night, doll.

22:31.055 --> 22:33.091
Oh, my fucking God.
Seven, what happened?

22:33.123 --> 22:36.393
Huh?
What?

22:36.427 --> 22:38.363
- What happened?
- First, I need drugs, all right?

22:38.395 --> 22:40.264
Just roll me a spliff and
then I'll tell you all about

22:40.297 --> 22:42.299
the gangster flick that I just
had the privilege to star in.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.469
Baby, baby, baby, your face.
Your face.

22:45.503 --> 22:48.139
I know.
I know.

22:48.171 --> 22:50.007
Just roll me a spliff,
all right?

22:52.009 --> 22:53.545
Okay.

22:53.577 --> 22:57.548
Well, the core plot point.
I got pistol whipped.

22:59.549 --> 23:02.019
- Twice.
- Oh, my God!

23:02.053 --> 23:04.456
Why, by...
What happened?

23:04.488 --> 23:06.725
I'm guessing I can't just
give you the cliff notes, huh?

23:06.757 --> 23:07.959
Uh-uh, no.

23:07.992 --> 23:12.096
I want the unrated, extended
cut, with director commentary.

23:16.366 --> 23:19.770
All right, where do I start?

23:19.804 --> 23:23.007
Um, I guess...
I guess with the call.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.010
So, um, this morning,
I get a call from Dave.

23:27.612 --> 23:28.779
Wait.
Like thee Dave?

23:28.813 --> 23:31.049
Yeah, babe, like
the only Dave that I know.

23:31.082 --> 23:32.517
Yo.

23:32.549 --> 23:34.051
Holy shit!
What did he say?

23:34.084 --> 23:35.252
Well, can I tell you the story?

23:35.286 --> 23:37.654
Yeah, sorry.
Go on.

23:37.688 --> 23:40.425
So, this morning
I get a call from Dave

23:40.458 --> 23:42.293
saying that he wants
to link up, you know,

23:42.325 --> 23:43.761
because it's been
six fuckin' years.

23:43.795 --> 23:44.962
- So, of course I agree...
- Wait.

23:44.996 --> 23:47.799
Your childhood best friend,
that you've been talking about

23:47.832 --> 23:49.767
for the past forever,
called you up this morning,

23:49.801 --> 23:52.037
and you didn't bother
waking me up to tell me?

23:52.069 --> 23:54.638
Babe, I tried, all right?
You were just dead to the world.

23:54.671 --> 23:55.806
Wake up.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.443
Oh, yeah, 'cause of that shit
you gave me last night.

23:58.476 --> 24:02.247
Anyways, so, you know,
we just met up at this diner.

24:02.279 --> 24:03.580
Oh, fuck!
Yo, my man!

24:03.613 --> 24:05.549
- How the fuck you been, dog?
- What's up, man?

24:05.583 --> 24:07.151
I don't know.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.053
We just caught up for a while,
bullshitted and whatnot.

24:09.086 --> 24:10.220
Shit. It's been forever,
my nigga.

24:10.254 --> 24:11.656
Trust, dude, but, yo,

24:11.689 --> 24:13.525
what the fuck is up
with this get-up, kid?

24:13.557 --> 24:15.526
What are you... It's like fuckin'
80 degrees outside.

24:15.559 --> 24:17.394
What are you,
tryin' to detox or somethin'?

24:17.428 --> 24:20.098
It's the first thing, you
already gettin' at me, nigga?

24:20.131 --> 24:21.533
It's the only thing
I had clean at the moment.

24:21.565 --> 24:23.468
- All right, you asshole?
- Still a fuckin' bum ass, I see.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.202
Suck a fuckin'
dick, man.

24:25.236 --> 24:27.472
Ah, son.
What the fuck is good, man?

24:27.505 --> 24:29.507
How the fuck did you even
get my number, cousin?

24:29.539 --> 24:31.276
Cake, nigga.

24:31.308 --> 24:33.644
Word on the street is you
the mother fuckin' man now.

24:33.678 --> 24:36.581
I mean, I mean,
I mean, I might be.

24:36.613 --> 24:38.450
But you know, I've been
tryin' to stay in the cut.

24:38.482 --> 24:40.551
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
not good enough, nigga.

24:40.584 --> 24:41.853
Yeah, well, whatever, man.

24:41.885 --> 24:43.821
I mean if a fuckin' crackhead
like you can find me,

24:43.854 --> 24:45.556
then, yeah, fuck,
I'm in for it, right?

24:45.590 --> 24:47.158
You're goddamn right, boy.

24:47.190 --> 24:49.460
Nah, but for real though,
D, what's aspiring, dog?

24:49.494 --> 24:52.263
- How the fuck you been?
- Hungry, nigga, hungry.

24:52.296 --> 24:53.230
Yeah, I can see that.

24:53.264 --> 24:54.866
You're lookin'
a little slender there, pimp.

24:54.899 --> 24:56.468
What did you lose some weight?

24:56.500 --> 24:59.103
This nigga, man.
What the fuck though, man?

24:59.136 --> 25:00.304
It's been what?

25:00.337 --> 25:01.839
Mother fuckin'
six years and shit?

25:01.873 --> 25:04.574
Yeah, man.
Just about.

25:04.609 --> 25:06.544
Fuck, you know, I'm doin'
all right though, dude.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.479
You know, I can't complain.
I got...

25:08.513 --> 25:11.583
I got a nice little spot,
you know, a fine chick.

25:11.615 --> 25:12.883
- So, I ain't mad.
- Oh, word?

25:12.917 --> 25:14.285
- Yeah.
- You got a chick?

25:14.317 --> 25:15.886
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like a real thing?

25:15.920 --> 25:18.555
- Yeah, man, like, like the one.
- The one?

25:18.588 --> 25:19.790
Yeah.

25:19.824 --> 25:22.127
I ain't never
heard you talk like that, boy.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.795
What the fuck
happened to you, huh?

25:23.827 --> 25:26.396
Remember that "Bitches ain't
shit." tip you used to be on?

25:27.632 --> 25:29.767
You know, we all gotta
grow up sometimes, man.

25:29.799 --> 25:32.536
- You told him about me?
- Of course

25:32.569 --> 25:34.304
Oh, shit.

25:34.337 --> 25:35.507
- Sorry, Sev.
- Fuck, baby!

25:35.539 --> 25:36.707
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

25:36.740 --> 25:37.908
- Fuck it hurts!
- Your poor face.

25:37.941 --> 25:39.309
- Yes!
- Okay.

25:39.343 --> 25:41.513
But keep goin',
all right?

25:41.546 --> 25:43.648
Wow, babe, I'm glad
you're so fucking concerned.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.883
- Oh, don't be a pussy.
- I am what I eat, baby.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.686
Oh, my God, ew.
Gimme' that.

25:49.219 --> 25:51.823
Anyways, uh...

25:51.855 --> 25:55.425
So, he gets all serious on me
after we finish eating,

25:55.459 --> 25:57.394
asking me if we could
go outside to talk.

25:57.428 --> 25:58.696
- Yeah, I'm good, brother.
- Yo, um...

25:58.728 --> 26:00.364
You mind if I holler
at you outside real quick?

26:00.398 --> 26:02.267
I got somethin' I'm tryin'
to run past you for a second.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.734
- Yeah.
- Oh, all right.

26:03.767 --> 26:07.404
Oh, woo!

26:09.440 --> 26:11.875
- So, what's happenin', D?
- All right, so look.

26:11.909 --> 26:13.344
I got a little deal
I'm workin' on.

26:13.376 --> 26:14.544
- You feel me?
- Mm-hm.

26:14.577 --> 26:16.647
And I was hopin' that you
could help out with supplies.

26:16.680 --> 26:17.949
Seein' as you
the man and all now.

26:17.981 --> 26:19.783
What you lookin' for?

26:19.816 --> 26:22.353
That's the thing.
It ain't for me.

26:22.385 --> 26:24.755
- I'm middin' for this other cat.
- And who's that?

26:24.788 --> 26:25.956
This Puerto Rican nigga.

26:25.989 --> 26:29.560
Just set up shop in Harlem.
Serious cat, serious bread.

26:29.594 --> 26:30.761
He's gonna
put some money in my...

26:30.795 --> 26:32.363
D, D, D, let me
stop you right there, dog.

26:32.395 --> 26:33.430
- Come on.
- What?

26:33.463 --> 26:35.700
Have you not taken
a fuckin' good look at me, dog?

26:35.732 --> 26:37.668
I don't fuck with
crimey niggas no more, D.

26:37.701 --> 26:39.269
My operation
is suit and tie,

26:39.303 --> 26:41.406
white lab jacket,
no burners type shit, dog.

26:41.439 --> 26:43.541
It's straight business, man.

26:43.574 --> 26:45.877
And I don't need any more
of it right now, all right?

26:45.910 --> 26:47.844
Yo, you wouldn't even have
to deal with this shit, a'ight?

26:47.878 --> 26:49.814
You won't have to see the cat.
Look, look.

26:49.846 --> 26:51.516
I'ma deal with
the whole thing,

26:51.548 --> 26:53.483
bring you back your cut of the
bread when when it's wrapped.

26:53.517 --> 26:54.351
Simple and sweet.

26:54.384 --> 26:56.820
D, I got rules
to this shit, all right?

26:56.853 --> 26:58.021
That's what keeps me up.

26:58.055 --> 27:00.959
Yo, I'm askin' you a personal
favor, my nigga, all right?

27:00.991 --> 27:02.559
Like this shit
could really help me out,

27:02.593 --> 27:03.894
put some bread in my pocket.

27:03.928 --> 27:06.664
I'm strugglin' out here
right now, my nigga.

27:06.697 --> 27:10.635
Fuck, man!

27:10.668 --> 27:14.238
How much and of what?

27:14.271 --> 27:16.507
A whole one.
Of Heavy.

27:20.411 --> 27:22.747
All right.

27:22.779 --> 27:24.382
I guess I can
let you run with a zip.

27:24.414 --> 27:26.783
Nah, nah, I ain't talkin'
about a zip, my nigga.

27:26.816 --> 27:27.986
I'm talkin' about a brick.

27:28.018 --> 27:30.421
He wanted you
to front him a brick?

27:30.453 --> 27:32.823
- Yeah, I know.
- Is he fuckin' crazy?

27:32.856 --> 27:34.858
That shit's like 110 grand!

27:34.892 --> 27:36.760
More like 150, babe.

27:36.794 --> 27:38.363
And that's exactly
what I told him.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.796
150 fuckin' racks?

27:39.830 --> 27:41.566
Who the fuck you sellin' to,
the Prince of Persia?

27:41.598 --> 27:43.900
Yo, this ain't some
street shit, dog, all right?

27:43.933 --> 27:44.901
It's pure China.

27:44.934 --> 27:48.338
You heard I was "that dude"?
This is why, man!

27:48.372 --> 27:49.907
Look, it's just
not gonna happen.

27:49.940 --> 27:51.776
I can't let you
roll with that, man.

27:51.808 --> 27:54.678
Look, there's absolutely no way
in Hell that I'm gonna go

27:54.711 --> 27:57.382
meet with some dude that I don't
know to talk about a brick.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.982
Fuck, man!
Get the fuck out of here!

27:59.016 --> 28:00.817
Like, please, dog, tell me
this isn't the only reason

28:00.851 --> 28:01.919
why you hit' me up.

28:01.951 --> 28:04.721
No, my nigga,
of course not, a'ight?

28:04.755 --> 28:06.056
Yeah, that's part of it,

28:06.090 --> 28:08.793
but I straight up wanted to see
how the fuck you was doin', yo.

28:08.825 --> 28:11.562
I just figured, you know,
two birds and shit.

28:11.594 --> 28:13.297
Two birds.
This fuckin' dude right here.

28:13.331 --> 28:14.498
I'm outta here, man.
Fuck you, man.

28:14.532 --> 28:15.733
No, no, no,
let me say somethin'.

28:15.766 --> 28:16.933
- Let me say somethin'.
- What, bro?

28:16.967 --> 28:19.003
- What?
- Look, my bad, a'ight?

28:19.036 --> 28:20.805
A'ight?
That shit's dumb.

28:20.837 --> 28:22.806
All right, I hit you up,
stupid out of nowhere,

28:22.840 --> 28:26.010
and asked you to front me
a fuckin' brick, a'ight?

28:26.043 --> 28:29.546
Look, it's disrespectful,
and I apologize for that shit.

28:29.580 --> 28:30.948
You know you my nigga
over everything,

28:30.980 --> 28:33.984
but I am strugglin'
right now, my nigga.

28:34.017 --> 28:35.620
I just figured
you could help me out, a'ight?

28:35.652 --> 28:36.854
That's it.

28:40.623 --> 28:44.695
All right.

28:44.728 --> 28:47.931
Whatever, man.
All right, just, look.

28:47.965 --> 28:49.867
It just feels like
you just fuckin' hittin' me up

28:49.900 --> 28:52.704
'cause you need bread, dog,
and that's cool, man.

28:52.737 --> 28:56.574
You know I got you,
bro, no matter what.

28:56.606 --> 28:59.109
You my homie, dog, but like...

28:59.142 --> 29:01.912
All right, look.
Fuck, man.

29:01.946 --> 29:03.848
I'll tell you what.

29:03.881 --> 29:05.882
Why don't you just start making
my runs for me, all right?

29:05.915 --> 29:07.617
It'll be good bread, man.
I'll cut you in pretty.

29:07.651 --> 29:09.053
You know I won't
fuckin' do you wrong, man.

29:09.085 --> 29:11.655
Look, I ain't you,
Sev, a'ight?

29:11.689 --> 29:15.058
You know I'ma fuck that shit up
and end up in bracelets, bro.

29:15.092 --> 29:18.563
I ain't slick like you,
my nigga.

29:18.595 --> 29:20.832
Look, how about this, a'ight?

29:20.864 --> 29:22.032
You just
sit down with this nigga

29:22.065 --> 29:23.468
at a spot of your choosin'.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.668
Just have a chat
with this nigga.

29:24.701 --> 29:25.902
- That's all.
- Baby, no, you didn't!

29:25.936 --> 29:27.438
He was my best friend.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.574
I mean, I mean, what am
I supposed to tell him?

29:29.606 --> 29:30.774
- To go fuck himself?
- Yeah!

29:30.807 --> 29:31.975
- No, man.
- Yeah!

29:32.008 --> 29:33.411
- What if he had been a snitch?
- Maddie.

29:33.443 --> 29:34.845
- Sev, what if he is a snitch?
- Maddie, chill!

29:34.879 --> 29:35.914
What if he is a snitch?

29:35.947 --> 29:37.815
Sev, you can't be
fuckin' around with this shit!

29:37.847 --> 29:38.681
Chill, all right?

29:38.716 --> 29:40.084
What if you get
taken away from me?

29:40.116 --> 29:41.351
I considered all of that,
babe, all right?

29:41.384 --> 29:45.055
, I was careful not
to do anything stupid that will

29:45.088 --> 29:46.490
get me into any shit...

29:46.524 --> 29:48.159
- Said your face.
- Legal shit.

29:48.191 --> 29:49.926
, according my face,

29:49.959 --> 29:52.028
none of this has anything
to do with the cops, all right?

29:52.062 --> 29:55.700
So can you please, babe, just
keep your comments and questions

29:55.732 --> 29:57.467
for after the fucking story?

29:57.500 --> 29:59.738
- Okay.
- Thank you.

30:01.939 --> 30:05.977
So, I gave him a place
and a time, all right?

30:06.009 --> 30:09.814
A place and a time that would
give any potential cops

30:09.846 --> 30:12.048
no kind of time
to set any shit up.

30:12.082 --> 30:13.117
Rodrigo Dominguez.

30:13.150 --> 30:16.888
It's a pleasure to finally
make your acquaintance.

30:16.921 --> 30:20.056
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Well, that's not good.

30:20.090 --> 30:23.661
Oh, tranquillo.
Not from the streets.

30:23.693 --> 30:25.562
From our mutual friend,
David, here.

30:25.595 --> 30:28.565
- That's hardly better.
- No, no, no, I just told him...

30:28.598 --> 30:32.569
Yo, D, do you mind if I just
get a minute with Mr. Dominguez?

30:32.603 --> 30:34.705
Now, at this point,
the shit that I took was really

30:34.738 --> 30:35.706
startin' to
really kick in.

30:35.738 --> 30:39.709
So, I'm not gonna lie.
I was kind of fucked up.

30:39.742 --> 30:41.511
I just started spitting it
to this guy like I was

30:41.545 --> 30:42.712
the goddamn man.

30:42.746 --> 30:44.482
Mr. Dominguez.

30:44.515 --> 30:46.984
- Please, call me Rodrigo.
- Rodrigo, all right.

30:47.017 --> 30:48.619
I don't know you at all.

30:48.651 --> 30:52.824
I mean, for as much as I know,
you could be a fucking cop.

30:52.856 --> 30:53.825
I mean, I gotta say,

30:53.857 --> 30:57.894
this whole fuckin'
situation is pretty suspect.

30:57.928 --> 31:01.498
I haven't seen Dave in, what?
Like six fuckin' years.

31:01.532 --> 31:05.603
I mean,
six years of no contact.

31:06.769 --> 31:09.139
No attempts of reaching out.

31:09.172 --> 31:11.976
And then, today,
out of fucking nowhere,

31:12.008 --> 31:13.176
he just happens to pop up

31:13.209 --> 31:16.013
and know all about
my fucking business,

31:16.046 --> 31:20.116
and, in-fucking-sisting
that I fucking meet with you.

31:20.150 --> 31:23.688
So...

31:23.720 --> 31:26.190
Man, I mean, he was pushing
with all his might, by the way.

31:26.222 --> 31:28.124
I mean, he really, really
was pushing for the issue.

31:28.158 --> 31:29.727
So I'm gonna
have to apologize, man,

31:29.759 --> 31:33.597
but you gotta
understand my concern here.

31:33.631 --> 31:36.132
- Mr. Max.
- You can just call me Max.

31:40.938 --> 31:42.739
I can assure you

31:42.773 --> 31:47.111
that I'm not law enforcement.

31:47.143 --> 31:51.248
I can also assure you
that I'm a very serious man,

31:51.282 --> 31:56.254
here, representing
a serious organization,

31:56.286 --> 31:59.623
With the sole intent of
conducting serious business.

32:03.626 --> 32:06.796
Plain and simple,
I'm not a cop.

32:06.830 --> 32:11.269
Or as our friend, David,
so eloquently puts it,

32:11.302 --> 32:14.105
"a crimey nigger."

32:14.138 --> 32:16.207
Yeah, well,
you don't seem the type.

32:16.239 --> 32:17.674
But, you know,
bear with me here,

32:17.708 --> 32:22.213
'cause I'm gonna
have to inquire further.

32:22.246 --> 32:24.949
You see,
how do I know

32:24.981 --> 32:27.250
that you're not gonna slap

32:27.284 --> 32:30.755
some bracelets on me
the moment that I agree to do

32:30.787 --> 32:34.592
whatever the fuck you think
that I'm considering doing?

32:34.624 --> 32:37.694
Because for some reason,
you simply telling me

32:37.728 --> 32:38.895
that you're not a cop...

32:38.929 --> 32:40.163
And look, hey.

32:40.197 --> 32:43.301
I apologize for that because it
might seem a little bit strange.

32:43.334 --> 32:46.304
But you tellin' me that you're
not a cop's not doin' a thing.

32:49.907 --> 32:53.044
Mr. Max,

32:53.076 --> 32:55.680
if I were law enforcement,

32:55.712 --> 32:57.013
I wouldn't be going after you

32:57.046 --> 33:00.851
and your
ounce-at-a-time operation.

33:00.883 --> 33:04.654
I would be going after
your supplier, Mr. Bratva.

33:04.688 --> 33:05.957
How the fuck do you know about...

33:05.989 --> 33:07.991
Information, Mr. Max.

33:08.025 --> 33:10.761
That is the most
valuable commodity

33:10.794 --> 33:12.729
in my line of work.

33:12.763 --> 33:13.798
And as such,

33:13.831 --> 33:18.936
I take great care
obtaining all the information

33:18.969 --> 33:20.738
available about a territory

33:20.770 --> 33:24.741
before moving in
and establishing a network.

33:26.242 --> 33:29.279
You see,

33:29.313 --> 33:31.181
you happen to have

33:31.215 --> 33:35.319
the only good connection

33:35.352 --> 33:38.255
to the substance that I need.

33:38.287 --> 33:42.926
Which is the only reason
why you and me are sitting here

33:42.959 --> 33:44.996
having this conversation today.

33:48.899 --> 33:51.102
Then why don't you
just go to him directly?

33:51.134 --> 33:54.372
So you said "No"?

33:54.404 --> 33:58.108
Well, yeah, at first.

33:58.142 --> 33:59.309
Then you got pistol whipped?

33:59.343 --> 34:00.911
Yeah, Maddie,
he just pistol whipped me

34:00.943 --> 34:02.345
right there in the lobby.

34:02.379 --> 34:04.849
No, baby, come on.
Of course not, all right?

34:04.882 --> 34:07.384
He asked me if he could show me
something and I tell him,

34:07.418 --> 34:09.353
"You know,
I'm not gonna change my mind."

34:09.385 --> 34:12.989
And he's like "Ah, but
assumptions Mr. Max,"

34:13.022 --> 34:14.424
and insists that I take a look.

34:14.457 --> 34:16.726
So, I'm like,
you know, "Whatever."

34:16.759 --> 34:20.296
And then, this fucking guy
just nods at the bartender,

34:20.330 --> 34:21.699
and then out of fucking nowhere,

34:21.732 --> 34:24.067
this bellhop arrives,
and just shows up,

34:24.100 --> 34:27.203
and hands him a bag of fuckin'
origins unknown, okay?

34:27.236 --> 34:29.039
Now, at this point
I'm thinking, like,

34:29.073 --> 34:31.007
"How fucking early
was this guy?"

34:31.040 --> 34:33.376
You know, because as soon as he
grabs the bag, he takes me

34:33.410 --> 34:36.946
to this, like, back room, which
I'm assuming they do, like,

34:36.980 --> 34:38.181
you know,
private dinners and stuff.

34:38.214 --> 34:41.251
And you know how, like, some
nice hotels have like, you know,

34:41.285 --> 34:44.254
these fucking massive drapes
just tied open everywhere?

34:44.288 --> 34:46.924
- Yeah.
- Well...

34:46.957 --> 34:51.194
We walk into the back room
and this fucking bellhop

34:51.227 --> 34:54.264
just stands there and drops
the fucking drapes on us, right?

34:54.297 --> 34:55.332
What the fuck?

34:55.364 --> 34:56.933
Yeah, I know, I know.

34:56.966 --> 34:59.169
And when I'm all done
being creeped out by that,

34:59.203 --> 35:01.372
like, I fucking turn
and there's this bag, Maddie,

35:01.404 --> 35:04.374
just being hoisted
into my fucking face.

35:04.408 --> 35:07.344
- And guess what.
- What?

35:07.377 --> 35:10.014
- It's fuckin' full of money.
- For what?

35:10.047 --> 35:13.884
Two bricks.
Which, is very doable.

35:13.917 --> 35:15.052
But, you know,
I was still a bit iffy

35:15.085 --> 35:16.387
because I didn't
want to be delivering

35:16.419 --> 35:17.488
a key to this
guy every week.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.589
- Right?
- Mm-hm, yeah.

35:18.622 --> 35:21.292
So I tell him that,
and he goes on to tell me that

35:21.325 --> 35:22.826
he only needs these two bricks,

35:22.859 --> 35:25.328
and that he respects
my desire to stay small time,

35:25.361 --> 35:28.765
and that he's not expecting
a long-term arrangement.

35:28.799 --> 35:31.035
That makes no sense.
Why?

35:31.067 --> 35:33.336
Personally,
I don't care about quality.

35:33.370 --> 35:36.806
However,
when entering a new territory,

35:36.839 --> 35:41.277
a pure supply is essential
in creating a strong network.

35:41.310 --> 35:45.882
You see, by flooding the streets
with a superior product,

35:45.915 --> 35:48.919
you win over the addicts
from your competitors.

35:48.951 --> 35:50.955
And then you shut them down.

35:50.988 --> 35:53.290
Once they're shut down, it
doesn't matter what you sell.

35:53.323 --> 35:55.392
You didn't take that money
in advance did you?

35:55.424 --> 35:57.761
No, no, baby, of course not.

35:57.794 --> 35:59.863
I'm not
fuckin' retarded, all right?

35:59.897 --> 36:02.232
There's absolutely no way in
Hell that I'm gonna find myself

36:02.265 --> 36:06.336
owing Rodrigo Fucking
Question Marks 240 racks.

36:06.370 --> 36:09.172
I came here.
I grabbed my savings.

36:09.205 --> 36:12.408
And, Yuri fronted me
the remainder.

36:12.442 --> 36:14.545
I knew that if anything
happened, Yuri would let me

36:14.578 --> 36:17.314
work off the debt, you know?

36:17.346 --> 36:20.383
- You came back again?
- Baby!

36:20.417 --> 36:22.219
I tried every step of the way.

36:22.252 --> 36:24.421
But you were just
a fucking goner, Goddammit.

36:24.453 --> 36:27.190
Fuck!
Is that shit even safe?

36:27.223 --> 36:30.995
Totally, babe, you're just
a lightweight these days.

36:31.027 --> 36:34.165
Yeah, for real though.

36:34.198 --> 36:36.167
But anyways, moving on.

36:42.506 --> 36:44.007
Let's see here.

36:48.145 --> 36:51.916
- Business is good I see.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:55.618 --> 36:57.187
Hey.

36:57.221 --> 36:58.956
I got somethin' for you, my man.

36:58.989 --> 37:00.891
Seven, you are too good to me.

37:00.924 --> 37:02.993
Well, you know how
you're always going on about

37:03.026 --> 37:05.962
how much you miss
your fucking Quaaludes?

37:05.995 --> 37:07.997
- Boom.
- No!

37:08.031 --> 37:11.035
Yep!

37:11.067 --> 37:12.236
How did you find them?

37:12.268 --> 37:13.904
I know this guy
over at Columbia.

37:13.937 --> 37:15.306
Had him whip up
some methaqualone...

37:15.339 --> 37:18.107
Now, I've never had
a Quaalude before,

37:18.140 --> 37:21.244
but that shit right there
is somethin' else, my man.

37:28.384 --> 37:31.421
Seven, this is a beautiful gift.

37:31.455 --> 37:33.357
Tonight, I will take my girl out

37:33.390 --> 37:35.859
and I will fuck her
like a rock star!

37:35.893 --> 37:38.028
I'm glad you liked it, man.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.564
So, tell me.
How are things with Madeline?

37:40.596 --> 37:41.765
Good, good.

37:41.797 --> 37:45.035
She's actually, um, at the
apartment taking a few of those.

37:45.067 --> 37:46.636
But, hey,
let me know how they compare,

37:46.669 --> 37:49.439
'cause they've been
touted as "super-ludes."

37:49.473 --> 37:52.076
The taste is nostalgic.

37:52.109 --> 37:54.545
So, tell me.
What brings you over here?

37:54.578 --> 37:56.213
More money to clean?

37:56.245 --> 37:59.415
No, um, actually,
I need more product.

37:59.448 --> 38:03.219
- Already?
- Yeah, a lot more.

38:03.252 --> 38:06.022
- How much?
- A brick.

38:06.056 --> 38:07.925
- Seven...
- Look.

38:07.957 --> 38:09.559
I know what
you're thinking, all right?

38:09.593 --> 38:11.462
But it's a short-term
arrangement.

38:11.495 --> 38:12.930
I just gotta move two.

38:12.962 --> 38:16.600
One now, one later,
and that's it.

38:16.632 --> 38:19.303
I just wanna fucking feel
comfortable in my life, man,

38:19.335 --> 38:21.104
with my girl.

38:21.138 --> 38:23.574
You know,
I'm just fucking tired, Yuri.

38:23.607 --> 38:25.375
Of this everyday grind shit.

38:25.408 --> 38:26.676
I mean, you gotta
understand that, man.

38:26.710 --> 38:27.711
And you know me.

38:27.745 --> 38:30.080
I'm not in the fucking
wholesale biz, all right?

38:30.113 --> 38:32.015
I'll be out of the fucking game

38:32.049 --> 38:35.219
before they even know
I'm on the court.

38:35.252 --> 38:37.988
Seven, I hope you know
what you are doing.

38:38.020 --> 38:41.457
Because competition in this
business is not so friendly.

38:41.491 --> 38:44.594
I do.
I know.

38:44.627 --> 38:47.196
Okay.

38:47.230 --> 38:50.000
When do you need this for?

38:50.033 --> 38:52.502
Uh, in like 30 minutes?

38:52.535 --> 38:55.171
Look, I got 60 grand right here

38:55.205 --> 38:58.007
and I was hoping that
you can front me the remainder.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.010
I'm gonna get rid of this one
as soon as I get outta here.

39:01.044 --> 39:02.312
And I'll bring you
the cash tomorrow.

39:05.748 --> 39:08.151
You keep this.

39:08.185 --> 39:09.687
You should always have
some money on your person,

39:09.719 --> 39:11.689
in case for emergencies.

39:11.721 --> 39:14.490
We are going to call it 100
flat, as long as you bring me

39:14.524 --> 39:16.727
some more of these
next time you come by.

39:16.759 --> 39:19.029
Fuck, you got it, Yuri.
Thanks, man.

39:20.997 --> 39:25.668
Seven, this is a lot of product.
You should have a gun.

39:25.701 --> 39:27.671
I can give you a good price.

39:27.703 --> 39:31.007
And also, I can send some
people with you, if you need it.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.375
No, no, man, no.

39:32.408 --> 39:35.211
Thanks for the burner,
but you know me, bro.

39:35.245 --> 39:37.013
I don't do business
with those types of people.

39:37.047 --> 39:38.415
I got it under control, Yuri.

39:38.448 --> 39:40.216
You don't have to fuckin'
worry about it, all right?

39:40.250 --> 39:42.286
I'll come back
for the other one tomorrow.

39:42.319 --> 39:44.455
And come this time next week,

39:44.488 --> 39:46.522
I'll have a good amount
of cleanin' I'll need doin'.

39:46.556 --> 39:47.725
All right?

39:50.127 --> 39:54.264
You become more of a man
every time I see you.

39:54.297 --> 39:56.533
Keep it up.

39:56.565 --> 39:59.402
Hey, take it easy on those, bro.
They're fucking strong.

39:59.435 --> 40:00.470
I have been eating these things

40:00.504 --> 40:03.607
since before you were in
your father's sack, okay?

40:03.640 --> 40:05.342
There's a reason
they call me "The Machine."

40:05.375 --> 40:07.344
I'm just saying,
you better have, like,

40:07.377 --> 40:09.380
fucking 16 hours
in your schedule free.

40:09.413 --> 40:12.082
Otherwise, you should fuckin'
tell Pavel to bring you

40:12.114 --> 40:13.616
a nice little a pillow
and a little blanket.

40:13.649 --> 40:15.785
Smart ass.

40:15.819 --> 40:18.122
Okay, your stuff is going
to be ready out front

40:18.154 --> 40:19.422
in 10 minutes.

40:19.455 --> 40:20.490
Now, get the fuck out of here

40:20.524 --> 40:24.294
before I ask Pavel to
bring me a gun and a mop.

40:24.326 --> 40:27.096
So...

40:27.129 --> 40:28.698
Here's where the sky falls down.

40:31.301 --> 40:33.504
I get the package
from one of Yuri's guys

40:33.536 --> 40:35.538
and I'm on my way
to do the damn thing...

40:35.571 --> 40:37.807
Why did you rush all this shit?

40:37.841 --> 40:39.276
I don't know, babe.

40:39.308 --> 40:41.344
I just wanted to get
this shit over and done with.

40:41.377 --> 40:44.113
And, Rodrigo didn't
have any objections

40:44.147 --> 40:45.415
over the speedy process.

40:45.448 --> 40:46.816
So I just figured, you know,

40:46.850 --> 40:48.451
"Fuck it.
The sooner the better."

40:48.484 --> 40:50.553
Yeah, 'cause he's about
to fuckin' rob you!

40:50.587 --> 40:51.755
Rodrigo didn't rob me, okay?

40:51.788 --> 40:53.157
The stuff is right out there,

40:53.189 --> 40:55.525
safe and sound
on the kitchen counter.

40:55.558 --> 40:58.161
- You didn't get robbed?
- No, babe.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.330
Oh, that's fuckin' great, babe!

41:00.363 --> 41:01.698
Wait.
So, um...

41:01.730 --> 41:04.401
Why did you get
pistol whipped then?

41:04.433 --> 41:05.602
I'm about to tell you, baby.

41:05.634 --> 41:07.470
I get a call from Dave

41:07.504 --> 41:10.540
saying that Rodrigo
has changed the meeting location

41:10.573 --> 41:13.242
from the nice enough hotel
that we had agreed upon

41:13.276 --> 41:16.080
to some shitty motel
in the dead heart of the BX.

41:16.113 --> 41:17.448
What the fuck do you mean?
No, man!

41:17.480 --> 41:19.515
Dave?
Why would Dave call you?

41:19.549 --> 41:21.218
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to tell you.

41:21.250 --> 41:22.486
Um...

41:22.518 --> 41:23.687
Back at the hotel,

41:23.719 --> 41:26.723
Dave had suggested that all
communication go through him.

41:26.756 --> 41:28.658
- Why?
- More money.

41:28.692 --> 41:30.794
And to keep a distance
between Rodrigo and myself.

41:30.826 --> 41:32.562
I don't know, baby.
I was fucked up, all right?

41:32.596 --> 41:34.198
And it sounded smart.

41:34.230 --> 41:36.366
And Rodrigo was fucking
giving me anxiety and...

41:36.399 --> 41:38.102
I don't know, babe.
Fuck!

41:38.134 --> 41:41.638
It was Dave and I just
fuckin' agreed to it, all right?

41:41.671 --> 41:43.806
- It's pretty dumb.
- Yeah, I know.

41:43.839 --> 41:46.676
It was fucking stupid,
but, for the record,

41:46.710 --> 41:48.345
Rodrigo didn't care
for the idea either.

41:48.377 --> 41:52.149
So, I get a call from Dave

41:52.181 --> 41:54.517
saying that the meet location
is changed, right?

41:54.551 --> 41:56.753
So now I'm fucking pissed off,
because that's sketchy as fuck.

41:56.785 --> 41:58.387
But, you know,
I already had the brick on me.

41:58.421 --> 42:00.857
So I didn't wanna, you know,
have to go back to Yuri

42:00.890 --> 42:03.126
and ask him for a refund
like an fuckin' asshole.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.560
So, you know,

42:04.593 --> 42:08.664
I take my time bouncing up
to the new meet location.

42:08.698 --> 42:12.435
So I finally get to the motel
and Dave calls me again.

42:12.468 --> 42:13.870
Tells me that
everything is Gucci

42:13.904 --> 42:15.906
and that they're waiting for me.

42:15.939 --> 42:18.676
So, slowly,
I make my way to room 202.

42:23.812 --> 42:25.215
I knock on the door.

42:28.185 --> 42:29.386
I waited a while.

42:30.886 --> 42:33.890
And, jackpot.

42:35.325 --> 42:37.326
- No!
- Yup.

42:37.359 --> 42:42.265
Yeah, that's right.
Well, come on in, nigga.

42:42.299 --> 42:45.502
We been waitin'
on yo ass. Shit.

42:45.535 --> 42:47.404
<i>So now I'm in the room.</i>

42:47.437 --> 42:49.540
<i>We've got three of Rodrigo's
guys on the ground</i>

42:49.573 --> 42:51.208
<i>duct taped and all that.</i>

42:51.241 --> 42:52.576
<i>And one of them
is cold knocked out.</i>

42:52.609 --> 42:53.911
<i>And here I am</i>

42:53.944 --> 42:55.579
<i>stuck chillin' with two of
the hoodest boogers</i>

42:55.611 --> 42:57.314
<i>you could ever hope to meet.</i>

42:57.346 --> 42:59.415
<i>And the best part
about it is,</i>

42:59.448 --> 43:00.950
<i>they've got these
ski masks on,</i>

43:00.984 --> 43:03.219
<i>but not the black,
you know, "professional" ones.</i>

43:03.252 --> 43:05.788
<i>No, the ones with the fuckin'
puff balls on top of them.</i>

43:05.821 --> 43:07.890
<i>And they've got one of them
sitting on the bed</i>

43:07.924 --> 43:09.893
<i>going through the money,
my fuckin' money,</i>

43:09.926 --> 43:11.661
<i>like a fuckin' degenerate.</i>

43:11.694 --> 43:13.330
<i>And the other one
is shoving a pistol</i>

43:13.363 --> 43:14.931
<i>with a fucking
rotten potato on the barrel</i>

43:14.964 --> 43:17.433
<i>in my face asking me
where the work is.</i>

43:17.466 --> 43:18.901
<i>I didn't even know
potatoes went bad like that.</i>

43:18.935 --> 43:20.603
I don't got it.

43:20.636 --> 43:23.973
What the fuck you mean
you don't got it?

43:24.006 --> 43:26.642
I mean I don't
fuckin' got it.

43:26.676 --> 43:30.814
Hey, yo, don't make me start
squeezin' up in this bitch, man!

43:30.846 --> 43:33.816
Let him have it.
They're dead men walking.

43:33.850 --> 43:36.652
Hey, Papi, you open yo mouth
again yo fam's gonna' get

43:36.685 --> 43:38.654
some bad news,
real fuckin' soon!

43:38.687 --> 43:39.890
You feel me?

43:39.922 --> 43:43.926
Fuckin' right.
Now, where's that fuckin' work?

43:43.960 --> 43:45.629
I ain't fucking playin'
with you, man.

43:45.661 --> 43:50.500
Chicos got the loot.
Gringo has got the work.

43:50.533 --> 43:52.268
Loot's right
fuckin' there!

43:52.301 --> 43:53.469
So where
the fuck's the work, man?

43:53.502 --> 43:54.638
Shit!

43:54.671 --> 43:56.939
Yo, can you not hear me or
are you just fuckin' retarded?

43:56.973 --> 43:59.776
- I said I don't fuckin'...
- Get the fuck outta here.

43:59.808 --> 44:01.812
Sit yo ass down.

44:01.844 --> 44:04.614
Fuck.

44:04.647 --> 44:06.482
Mm,
let that shit marinate.

44:06.515 --> 44:09.652
What, huh?
Come here.

44:09.685 --> 44:11.388
Look.

44:13.390 --> 44:15.359
Shit!

44:15.392 --> 44:18.629
Mother fucker, you want another
mouth behind your ears, bitch?

44:18.661 --> 44:21.265
I ain't gon'
ask you again.

44:21.297 --> 44:24.634
Where's my work?

44:24.667 --> 44:26.736
Why the fuck do you think
that I was late, huh?

44:26.770 --> 44:28.705
Hm?

44:28.738 --> 44:31.674
I dropped that shit off and
I came here to set a new meet,

44:31.707 --> 44:33.042
mother fucker, all right?

44:33.076 --> 44:35.746
I don't do last minute changes,
you stupid fuck!

44:35.779 --> 44:37.447
You really thought that
I was gonna bring a key

44:37.480 --> 44:38.849
to the fuckin' projects?

44:38.881 --> 44:43.719
You fuckin' moron!

44:43.752 --> 44:46.022
You want
that fucking work, bitch?

44:46.056 --> 44:50.861
Then go get it from
Yuri Bratva, all right?

44:50.893 --> 44:54.363
Because that's
who's holding it for me.

44:54.397 --> 44:56.866
Now, make sure
that you bring

44:56.899 --> 44:58.567
all your fuckin'
monkeys with you

44:58.600 --> 45:01.537
if you to go to war against
the Russians, all right?

45:01.571 --> 45:04.607
Because I don't think that a
bitch ass mother fucker like you

45:04.640 --> 45:08.010
is gonna get anything from him.

45:08.044 --> 45:10.013
- Fuck you!
- Shit!

45:10.046 --> 45:13.683
- Mother fucker.
- Yo, T!

45:13.716 --> 45:15.318
Fuck the work, my nigga.

45:15.352 --> 45:17.721
It's 170 racks!
We hood rich.

45:17.754 --> 45:22.726
Let's put the mariachi
band to sleep and cut.

45:22.759 --> 45:26.396
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A'ight, fuck it then.

45:26.428 --> 45:28.531
We out.

45:28.564 --> 45:30.032
It's time for y'all niggas
to go night night.

45:30.065 --> 45:32.468
And then I passed out.

45:32.502 --> 45:33.603
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

45:33.636 --> 45:35.772
- Maddie, Maddie, Maddie!
- Why would you antagonize them?

45:35.805 --> 45:37.373
You could've got killed!
You fucking idiot!

45:37.406 --> 45:38.475
Hey stop!
Hey, stop, all right?

45:38.507 --> 45:41.511
Fuck!
I'm sorry!

45:41.544 --> 45:44.348
Fuck!

45:44.381 --> 45:46.049
I was just pissed
about Dave, all right?

45:46.082 --> 45:47.984
Dave, he's my fucking brother.

45:48.017 --> 45:49.752
It hurt, all right?
Bad.

45:49.785 --> 45:53.589
For fuck's sakes!

45:55.959 --> 45:57.361
It was for sure Dave?

46:00.397 --> 46:02.399
When I came to, all of
Rodrigo's guys were still there.

46:02.431 --> 46:05.901
Minus the money, so yeah,
I'm pretty fuckin' sure.

46:09.806 --> 46:13.443
What happened when you woke up?

46:13.475 --> 46:14.810
More like got woken up.

46:19.082 --> 46:20.484
Ah, fuck me.

46:23.085 --> 46:27.424
Okay.

46:27.457 --> 46:29.393
Yo, amigo.

46:29.426 --> 46:30.960
<i>It appears your old friend</i>

46:30.993 --> 46:32.428
<i>is quite a snake.</i>

46:32.462 --> 46:34.864
Yeah, it looks that way.

46:34.897 --> 46:37.767
Hey, Mr. Dominguez, I hope
you don't think that I...

46:37.801 --> 46:41.171
If I did, you would
already be most informed.

46:41.203 --> 46:43.640
Cool.

46:43.672 --> 46:46.176
It seems in our haste
to do business together,

46:46.209 --> 46:50.446
we both did some very
avoidable mistakes.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.748
Embarrassingly,
I more so than you.

46:52.781 --> 46:57.653
Yeah, that sucks.

46:57.687 --> 47:00.790
You don't have any GPS
or nothing on the bag?

47:00.823 --> 47:03.726
You're a sharp boy, Mr. Max.

47:03.759 --> 47:06.495
It's unfortunate, but
I was so busy examining you,

47:06.529 --> 47:10.434
I overlooked the most
concerning piece on the board.

47:10.466 --> 47:11.667
Hm.

47:11.701 --> 47:14.070
Yeah, I hope
when all of this settles

47:14.102 --> 47:15.805
we can move ahead as planned.

47:15.839 --> 47:17.007
Yeah,

47:17.040 --> 47:21.878
I can't even
move this if I wanted to.

47:21.910 --> 47:25.648
From here on, we will
be communicating directly.

47:25.681 --> 47:30.654
Now, if you would be so kind
as to hand over the phone

47:30.687 --> 47:32.788
to one of the two gentlemen
in front of you,

47:32.821 --> 47:33.989
that don't look like
they're on the verge

47:34.022 --> 47:37.626
of shitting themselves,
that would be most appreciated.

47:37.660 --> 47:40.730
- Yeah.
- Oh, and Mr. Max?

47:40.763 --> 47:44.167
- Yeah?
- We will find them.

47:44.200 --> 47:47.703
And they will be dealt with.
Harshly.

47:47.736 --> 47:50.172
So, yeah, babe.

47:50.205 --> 47:52.843
My best...

47:56.678 --> 48:00.683
My second best friend set me up.

48:03.652 --> 48:05.589
And Rodrigo is
the scariest mother fucker

48:05.622 --> 48:08.757
I've ever met in my life.

48:08.790 --> 48:12.595
I think he killed the guy at the
motel for just getting scared.

48:12.629 --> 48:15.665
Which...
It's beautiful.

48:18.567 --> 48:20.169
And now,
my face has been on fire

48:20.203 --> 48:23.206
for the past two
and a half hours.

48:23.239 --> 48:26.943
Holy fucking shit.

48:26.975 --> 48:29.979
I can't believe
I didn't see that shit coming!

48:30.013 --> 48:31.915
I'm such a fucking idiot.

48:31.948 --> 48:36.585
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

48:36.618 --> 48:39.189
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

48:39.221 --> 48:43.125
Is there anything
that I can do for you, hm?

48:49.966 --> 48:51.268
- Hm?
- Yeah.

48:51.301 --> 48:54.203
Yeah?

48:54.236 --> 48:56.805
But you're not gonna like it.

48:56.839 --> 48:58.041
What?

49:01.877 --> 49:03.846
I need to get into some Heavy.

49:08.151 --> 49:12.288
I need you to not give me
a hard time about it, okay?

49:12.321 --> 49:13.789
Again?

49:17.292 --> 49:18.428
Yeah, babe.

49:18.460 --> 49:23.033
Sev, you really can't be
fuckin' around with this shit.

49:23.065 --> 49:26.136
You almost went
too far last time.

49:26.169 --> 49:28.270
I know.
I know, Maddie.

49:28.303 --> 49:32.608
But if there was
ever a fucking time, baby.

49:32.642 --> 49:36.779
My face is killing me,
all right.

49:36.812 --> 49:40.349
My nerves are shot.

49:40.382 --> 49:43.053
And my mind
just won't be fucking quiet.

49:43.085 --> 49:45.988
It's not like fucking
coherent thoughts, baby.

49:46.022 --> 49:50.125
It's like frantic fucking
cross chatter, all right?

49:50.158 --> 49:51.961
I'm literally minutes away
from losing my shit.

49:51.995 --> 49:53.163
I'm sorry.

49:53.196 --> 49:54.764
It's the only fucking
opiate I have here.

49:54.797 --> 49:58.268
It's okay.
It's okay, fine.

49:58.301 --> 50:00.870
It's fine.
I'm gonna do it with you.

50:00.902 --> 50:02.372
- No, baby, come on!
- What?

50:02.404 --> 50:04.073
I can't be dealing
with this shit tonight.

50:04.107 --> 50:05.342
What, it's okay
for you to do it to me?

50:05.375 --> 50:07.077
But not for me to do it to you?

50:07.109 --> 50:09.845
Listen, if you wanna
slam yourself out,

50:09.879 --> 50:12.114
you're just gonna have
to deal with me doin' it too.

50:12.147 --> 50:16.852
Maddie, I can't even begin to
get into all the fucking reasons

50:16.886 --> 50:18.822
why this isn't even
remotely similar

50:18.855 --> 50:20.657
when I was
on that shit for you, okay?

50:20.689 --> 50:24.159
Okay, fine, point made.
But, it's been, what?

50:24.192 --> 50:26.796
Two and half years
since I was like that.

50:26.828 --> 50:29.966
And, thanks to you,
I have my self control back.

50:29.998 --> 50:32.801
Besides,
look at your fuckin' hands.

50:32.835 --> 50:34.938
I'm gonna have
to dose you anyways.

50:34.971 --> 50:38.342
Whatever, Maddie.

50:57.727 --> 50:58.895
Whoa, Maddie.
What the fuck?

50:58.928 --> 51:00.130
Not so much, baby.

51:11.207 --> 51:14.109
You ready?

51:14.143 --> 51:15.345
Yeah.

51:24.419 --> 51:25.954
- Okay.
- Wait, wait.

51:25.988 --> 51:28.125
- Hold still.
- Wait.

51:38.901 --> 51:42.439
- I done good.
- Real good, baby.

51:42.471 --> 51:46.875
Real good.

51:46.908 --> 51:51.347
Okay, my turn.

51:53.482 --> 51:55.451
Bullshit.

51:55.484 --> 51:57.286
It's a tiny, little amount.

52:51.808 --> 52:55.512
Sayonara, baby.
I love you.

53:25.908 --> 53:27.110
Are you okay?

53:55.605 --> 53:58.074
You stay
the Hell away from this family.

53:58.107 --> 54:00.877
You're nothing
but pure evil, Seven.

54:00.910 --> 54:04.980
A curse.
You're dead to us.

54:05.013 --> 54:06.415
You hear me?

54:08.183 --> 54:12.455
Baby, please.

54:12.488 --> 54:16.926
Please.

54:16.959 --> 54:19.596
Wake up, Maddie.
Please, please.

54:19.629 --> 54:22.931
Maddie.

54:22.964 --> 54:27.303
Maddie, I'm sorry.

54:32.073 --> 54:33.408
I'm sorry.

54:41.017 --> 54:42.417
Look, kid.

54:42.451 --> 54:47.290
I know this is a rough time
for you right now.

54:49.392 --> 54:51.227
But we're gonna have to bring
your down to the station

54:51.259 --> 54:53.962
and ask you a few questions.

54:53.995 --> 54:57.666
All right?

54:57.700 --> 55:00.602
You're not under arrest,
or anything like that, but,

55:00.636 --> 55:02.939
we just need to get
a few things straight.

55:04.272 --> 55:06.008
Yeah, you hear me?

55:06.042 --> 55:07.244
Okay.

55:27.330 --> 55:28.899
Fuck!

55:52.754 --> 55:57.059
Seven, wake up.

56:01.163 --> 56:02.498
<i>Mr. Max?</i>

56:05.533 --> 56:09.638
I have something to ask of you.
It's very important to me.

56:09.672 --> 56:12.507
<i>I'm sorry,
but I can't let him live.</i>

56:12.540 --> 56:14.076
That's not what I want.

56:16.178 --> 56:18.448
Let me do it.

56:18.480 --> 56:19.649
<i>I hardly think...</i>

56:19.681 --> 56:23.652
Chances are the money's long
gone, and even if it isn't,

56:23.685 --> 56:26.957
it's likely they've already
spent a good bit of it.

56:29.759 --> 56:34.731
If you let me do this,
whether I find the money or not,

56:34.763 --> 56:37.700
the shit is yours.

56:37.732 --> 56:40.469
<i>Why?</i>

56:40.502 --> 56:44.539
You needn't concern yourself

56:44.573 --> 56:48.044
with such unfortunate affairs.

56:48.076 --> 56:51.080
<i>What about him?</i>

56:51.113 --> 56:52.381
<i>Your friend?</i>

56:52.415 --> 56:53.616
I'll know how
to find him.

56:58.654 --> 57:00.456
You either
let me do this,

57:00.489 --> 57:03.359
or I will chuck this
piece of death into the river.

57:03.392 --> 57:04.627
<i>I am not the type of man</i>

57:04.660 --> 57:06.629
<i>you would be wise
to threaten.</i>

57:06.661 --> 57:08.663
It's not a threat.
That's just what's gonna happen.

57:08.696 --> 57:10.465
Now, make a decision.

57:10.498 --> 57:12.368
<i>You have until
tomorrow afternoon.</i>

57:12.401 --> 57:14.404
<i>And then it's back
in my hands</i>

57:14.437 --> 57:16.672
<i>and I will still expect
the same arrangements.</i>

57:16.705 --> 57:18.074
<i>You understand?</i>

57:18.107 --> 57:19.375
Forward me the address.

57:28.517 --> 57:29.719
What now?

57:33.388 --> 57:37.727
They all gotta go.
All of 'em.

57:37.759 --> 57:41.696
- And then?
- I don't know.

57:41.730 --> 57:45.201
I haven't thought
that far ahead yet.

57:45.234 --> 57:48.438
The future seems
pretty unimaginable.

57:48.471 --> 57:52.809
The past?
Unbearable.

57:52.841 --> 57:56.411
I've gotta focus
on the present here, Yuri.

57:56.444 --> 58:01.316
My life is just livable
in the now, you know?

58:01.350 --> 58:02.552
I do.

58:06.122 --> 58:09.792
If you are to do this,
you will do it right.

58:09.825 --> 58:12.194
You will need more
than just a gun.

58:12.227 --> 58:16.698
A silencer and a few things
to keep them under control.

58:16.732 --> 58:18.334
Hey?

58:23.172 --> 58:26.109
Pavel!

58:26.142 --> 58:27.576
<i>With the silencer?</i>

58:27.609 --> 58:29.245
Da.

58:34.884 --> 58:38.588
Seven, please,
let me just send some people.

58:38.620 --> 58:41.523
Nah, it's gotta be me.

58:41.556 --> 58:43.792
Then let me send
some people with you.

59:01.410 --> 59:05.480
I appreciate this more
than you'll ever know, Yuri.

59:05.513 --> 59:08.151
You're a true
fucking friend, man.

59:08.183 --> 59:10.386
And I love you for that.

59:10.419 --> 59:14.790
Seven, you are like family.
Anything for you.

59:18.460 --> 59:23.199
I actually need you to,
um, find someone for me.

59:27.203 --> 59:29.572
- This is...
- Yeah.

59:29.605 --> 59:32.942
I see.

59:32.975 --> 59:34.944
A few hours.

59:34.977 --> 59:36.379
Thanks, man.

59:44.919 --> 59:49.591
Oh, and, um, one more thing.

59:49.625 --> 59:51.594
Da?

59:51.627 --> 59:53.395
I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to pay for that brick,

59:53.428 --> 59:56.298
but, I think I know
how to make it square.

1:00:49.685 --> 1:00:51.853
Fuck.

1:00:57.326 --> 1:00:59.762
Okay, all right.

1:01:02.631 --> 1:01:05.301
Man...

1:01:43.739 --> 1:01:45.908
Oh, fuck.

1:01:45.940 --> 1:01:50.946
Oh, fuck.

1:01:53.381 --> 1:01:55.584
Oh, shit.
Okay.

1:01:55.616 --> 1:01:57.452
Okay.

1:01:57.486 --> 1:01:59.455
Oh, fuck.

1:02:10.998 --> 1:02:12.669
Ain't nobody there, man.

1:02:19.507 --> 1:02:21.977
Yo, I'ma fuck all
y'all little niggas up, man!

1:02:22.009 --> 1:02:23.778
Yo, what the fuck?

1:02:23.812 --> 1:02:25.448
- Get the gun, son!
- Shit!

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.749
Hey, move to the fucking wall!

1:02:27.783 --> 1:02:29.518
I can't!
You just fuckin' shot me!

1:02:29.551 --> 1:02:31.053
- You bitch nigga!
- Do it now!

1:02:31.085 --> 1:02:32.754
- Grab the gun, son!
- Hey, hey!

1:02:32.788 --> 1:02:34.757
- Hey, yo, motherfucker...
- Get on your fuckin' knees.

1:02:34.790 --> 1:02:36.058
Do it!

1:02:36.091 --> 1:02:37.593
And crawl over
to your little...

1:02:37.625 --> 1:02:39.127
- Fuck you, white boy!
- Fuck you, what?

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:41.763
- Huh, you lost? You lost motherfucker?
- Shit!

1:02:41.797 --> 1:02:44.867
Shut the fuck up!

1:02:44.899 --> 1:02:47.135
You shakin', white boy.
Calm down.

1:02:47.169 --> 1:02:49.504
What you gon' do?
Lala, look at him.

1:02:49.538 --> 1:02:50.439
He fuckin' scared, son.

1:02:50.473 --> 1:02:52.074
- Get on your fucking ass.
- You fucked up.

1:02:52.107 --> 1:02:53.375
Get on your fucking ass!

1:02:53.408 --> 1:02:55.510
What?
Huh?

1:02:55.544 --> 1:02:56.746
You ain't got no fuckin' heart.

1:02:58.814 --> 1:03:00.082
Fuck, man!
Yo, Trey!

1:03:00.114 --> 1:03:01.116
- Fuck that, man!
- No? All right.

1:03:01.149 --> 1:03:03.685
How 'bout we try another
fucking no looker, bitch?

1:03:03.718 --> 1:03:04.953
- Trey!
- Ah, chill, chill!

1:03:04.986 --> 1:03:07.856
A'ight, tough guy, chill!

1:03:07.890 --> 1:03:12.862
Oh, man.
That was pretty close, huh?

1:03:12.895 --> 1:03:15.097
All right, tie him up,
behind the back.

1:03:15.129 --> 1:03:17.465
And make sure it's tight or I'll
fuckin' take another no looker.

1:03:17.498 --> 1:03:18.667
All right?

1:03:21.770 --> 1:03:25.141
I'm sure you two remember me
from the whole robbery thing

1:03:25.174 --> 1:03:27.710
a couple of days ago, right?

1:03:27.743 --> 1:03:31.113
But, if you don't,
I'm the white boy

1:03:31.145 --> 1:03:34.048
who was supposed
to have the work.

1:03:34.082 --> 1:03:37.853
I'm guessin' you
probably know why I'm here.

1:03:37.886 --> 1:03:40.489
The money.

1:03:40.522 --> 1:03:42.757
I actually just have
a couple questions.

1:03:42.790 --> 1:03:45.995
You answer them,
and maybe I let you go.

1:03:46.027 --> 1:03:47.196
Cool?

1:03:50.665 --> 1:03:51.834
Cool.

1:03:55.169 --> 1:03:56.971
How 'bout
we start with you, Cujo?

1:04:00.075 --> 1:04:03.745
- You fuckin' dead, fuck ass...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:04:03.779 --> 1:04:06.916
You want another mouth
behind your ears, bitch?

1:04:06.948 --> 1:04:10.151
Yeah, that's fuckin' right.

1:04:10.185 --> 1:04:13.189
Now, I'm gonna ask you
a fuckin' question, all right?

1:04:13.221 --> 1:04:14.622
And you're gonna
fuckin' answer it.

1:04:14.656 --> 1:04:16.692
You feel me?

1:04:16.725 --> 1:04:18.661
Do you know

1:04:18.694 --> 1:04:22.498
what you fucking took from me?

1:04:22.531 --> 1:04:23.699
Fuck you!
You ain't gotta...

1:04:23.732 --> 1:04:24.900
Boom!
Woo!

1:04:29.171 --> 1:04:33.576
Oh, my God!
You're fucking wrong!

1:04:38.212 --> 1:04:39.981
Well...

1:04:40.015 --> 1:04:43.185
Now, that we've established
that I do, in fact,

1:04:43.218 --> 1:04:46.989
have the heart...

1:04:47.022 --> 1:04:51.994
Let's move on
to contestant number two.

1:04:52.027 --> 1:04:56.065
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:04:56.098 --> 1:04:58.132
Come here.
Look at you.

1:04:58.165 --> 1:05:03.004
Hey, I know how it feels.
I really, really do.

1:05:03.038 --> 1:05:06.809
But, you chose this life.
Hm?

1:05:06.841 --> 1:05:10.111
You chose to hurt and take
things from other people.

1:05:10.145 --> 1:05:13.916
And more often than not,

1:05:13.948 --> 1:05:15.617
these set of actions

1:05:15.651 --> 1:05:18.921
set a fucking chain
of unintended consequences.

1:05:18.953 --> 1:05:21.823
You see?

1:05:21.857 --> 1:05:24.927
That's exactly what I am.

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:28.898
Your fucking
unintended consequence.

1:05:31.966 --> 1:05:34.035
Oh, Trey.

1:05:34.069 --> 1:05:37.739
I'm not gonna ask you again,
you piece of shit!

1:05:37.772 --> 1:05:39.107
My fucking leg, man!

1:05:39.140 --> 1:05:41.643
And I will give you one more
fucking try here, all right?

1:05:42.977 --> 1:05:46.281
Do you know what
you fucking took from me?

1:05:46.314 --> 1:05:49.183
Everything, man!
Everything, all right?

1:05:49.216 --> 1:05:51.619
You took everything
that I had left!

1:05:51.652 --> 1:05:52.620
All of it!

1:05:52.654 --> 1:05:56.292
You said
it wasn't the fucking money.

1:05:56.325 --> 1:05:58.928
You said it wasn't the money.
Come on, man.

1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:00.696
No, no, no.

1:06:00.728 --> 1:06:02.330
What is wrong with you,
my nigga?

1:06:02.364 --> 1:06:06.902
No, no, I guess I can't
fuckin' make you understand.

1:06:06.935 --> 1:06:09.171
It was D, my nigga!

1:06:09.203 --> 1:06:12.774
You so fuckin' stupid.

1:06:12.808 --> 1:06:16.145
- D set you up, huh, nigga?
- I know.

1:06:16.178 --> 1:06:18.180
I know.

1:06:20.314 --> 1:06:22.650
Actually,

1:06:22.683 --> 1:06:26.754
great segue
to my next question.

1:06:26.788 --> 1:06:29.757
Where is he?

1:06:29.790 --> 1:06:32.361
I, I, I don't know, man.

1:06:32.393 --> 1:06:34.062
You gotta
believe at this point

1:06:34.096 --> 1:06:36.732
that I'm not fuckin'
playin' around, all right?

1:06:36.765 --> 1:06:40.835
Now, how the fuck did you get
in contact with him afterwards?

1:06:40.868 --> 1:06:44.339
Yo, we didn't.
We set that nigga up.

1:06:44.372 --> 1:06:47.108
We set him up.

1:06:53.114 --> 1:06:56.951
Bullshit, man!
Fuck!

1:06:56.984 --> 1:06:58.152
Holy fuck, man!
Hold on.

1:06:58.185 --> 1:06:59.354
So you're tellin' me that D

1:06:59.388 --> 1:07:00.956
didn't get anything
for this shit?

1:07:02.823 --> 1:07:05.860
I mean, man,
you kinda have to appreciate

1:07:05.893 --> 1:07:08.631
the fuckin' irony here.

1:07:08.663 --> 1:07:12.368
What exactly was
he supposed to get?

1:07:12.401 --> 1:07:14.969
Give that nigga half a brick.

1:07:15.002 --> 1:07:18.806
Half the brick?
Why the fuck would he want that?

1:07:18.839 --> 1:07:20.776
Because nigga's
a fuckin' fiend.

1:07:27.948 --> 1:07:29.217
What'd you say?

1:07:29.250 --> 1:07:31.285
It's the truth, man!

1:07:31.319 --> 1:07:33.322
As long as we known him,
that nigga been a fiend!

1:07:33.355 --> 1:07:34.957
He'll shoot up
any fuckin' thing.

1:07:34.989 --> 1:07:36.725
Ain't you seen
that nigga's arm?

1:07:40.962 --> 1:07:43.866
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1:07:43.899 --> 1:07:46.969
How the fuck did he
get in contact with you, huh?

1:07:47.002 --> 1:07:48.170
We used a prepaid.

1:07:48.203 --> 1:07:49.371
Where is it?
You still got it?

1:07:49.404 --> 1:07:50.806
It's in the fucking room.

1:07:52.841 --> 1:07:55.044
Hey.
Which one?

1:07:55.076 --> 1:07:56.344
Silver and black one.

1:07:58.113 --> 1:08:00.114
Okay.

1:08:00.147 --> 1:08:03.451
First, you're gonna
call Dave, all right?

1:08:03.484 --> 1:08:05.887
And you're gonna tell him
that you got his cut,

1:08:05.921 --> 1:08:07.221
but he's gotta come
and get it right now,

1:08:07.254 --> 1:08:08.990
because you guys
are leavin' out of town.

1:08:09.024 --> 1:08:10.192
There's too much heat.

1:08:10.225 --> 1:08:12.761
You got me?
Okay.

1:08:12.794 --> 1:08:15.129
Now, be convincing now.

1:08:15.163 --> 1:08:16.965
This is the performance

1:08:16.997 --> 1:08:20.201
of your fucking worthless,
piece of shit life.

1:08:32.113 --> 1:08:35.451
- He ain't answerin', man.
- Still?

1:08:35.483 --> 1:08:39.087
No.

1:08:39.121 --> 1:08:43.959
Okay.
Where's the fuckin' money?

1:08:43.992 --> 1:08:45.093
Huh?

1:08:45.126 --> 1:08:47.462
Now, before you fuckin' answer,
take into consideration

1:08:47.496 --> 1:08:49.732
that if you say any type
of shit like "It's not here."

1:08:49.764 --> 1:08:50.998
Or, you "spent it all,"

1:08:51.032 --> 1:08:55.270
or any kind of fuckin'
bullshit like that,

1:08:55.303 --> 1:08:57.840
your fuckin' family
is gonna be able to save

1:08:57.872 --> 1:08:59.040
a lot of fuckin' money

1:08:59.073 --> 1:09:01.477
by having both
your fucking funerals

1:09:01.510 --> 1:09:04.847
at the same fucking time.

1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:06.348
You got me?

1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:08.015
Top part of the toilet.

1:09:08.049 --> 1:09:11.319
Really?

1:09:11.353 --> 1:09:12.520
Really?

1:09:12.554 --> 1:09:15.224
That's where you
fucking geniuses hid it?

1:09:15.256 --> 1:09:17.358
On top of the fucking toilet?

1:09:22.163 --> 1:09:24.265
Will you look at that?

1:09:24.299 --> 1:09:28.170
Now, remember, you piece
of shit, be convincing now.

1:09:28.202 --> 1:09:29.471
Okay.

1:09:34.075 --> 1:09:37.446
Yo, my nigga, what's good?

1:09:37.479 --> 1:09:39.548
Yeah, it's my fault, my fault.

1:09:39.581 --> 1:09:43.452
We had to lay low
for a second.

1:09:43.484 --> 1:09:45.453
Oh, yeah, nigga,

1:09:45.487 --> 1:09:48.357
it's just like you said,

1:09:48.389 --> 1:09:51.259
simple and sweet.

1:09:51.292 --> 1:09:52.493
But yo, check this, nigga.

1:09:52.527 --> 1:09:54.129
Like, yo, if you want that work,

1:09:54.162 --> 1:09:56.098
you gotta come and
get it right now.

1:09:56.130 --> 1:09:58.866
Yeah, right now, my nigga.

1:09:58.899 --> 1:10:01.202
Yo, the shit's hot around here.

1:10:01.236 --> 1:10:05.239
A couple niggas might know that
we got that bread, you feel me?

1:10:05.273 --> 1:10:09.044
Yeah, yeah,
we goin' upstate for a minute.

1:10:09.077 --> 1:10:11.446
But, yo, it's up to you, man.

1:10:11.479 --> 1:10:13.248
We leavin' in 2 hours.

1:10:13.281 --> 1:10:16.885
If you not here,
we leavin' with it.

1:10:16.917 --> 1:10:19.888
Yeah, all right.
A'ight.

1:10:22.189 --> 1:10:23.357
He's on his way.

1:10:23.390 --> 1:10:25.359
Wow!
Bro!

1:10:25.393 --> 1:10:28.363
Well fucking done, man!

1:10:28.395 --> 1:10:32.201
Well fucking done.
Oh, my God, bro.

1:10:32.233 --> 1:10:34.402
Instead of being
a piece of shit,

1:10:34.435 --> 1:10:37.471
you should've taken up
a career in the dramatic arts.

1:10:37.505 --> 1:10:41.475
Bro, that was
fuckin' unbelievable.

1:10:41.509 --> 1:10:45.279
You shoulda
been an actor, bro.

1:10:45.313 --> 1:10:47.382
But I guess your idiocy

1:10:47.415 --> 1:10:50.252
has spared you
a bullet in your face.

1:10:50.285 --> 1:10:51.487
So...

1:10:54.622 --> 1:10:56.325
Bravo.

1:10:59.594 --> 1:11:03.998
All right, I guess
you've done your job now.

1:11:04.032 --> 1:11:05.267
I'm gonna stop fuckin' with you.

1:11:10.572 --> 1:11:14.209
Now, I'm gonna
put this tape back.

1:11:14.242 --> 1:11:16.144
And I wanna ask you to lay here

1:11:16.176 --> 1:11:19.647
nice and quiet
while I deal with Davey boy.

1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:22.517
Cool?

1:11:22.550 --> 1:11:25.420
Cool, buddy.
There you go.

1:11:25.452 --> 1:11:26.921
Lie face down.
Come on.

1:11:39.334 --> 1:11:42.604
A deal's a deal.
Now, burn.

1:11:52.413 --> 1:11:57.085
20, 30, 40, 50, 60,

1:11:57.117 --> 1:12:00.022
70, 80, 90, 10, 20.

1:12:00.054 --> 1:12:02.490
What the fuck
did you guys spend 50 grand on

1:12:02.523 --> 1:12:04.492
in two fuckin' days, man?

1:12:04.526 --> 1:12:05.928
Fuck.

1:13:09.757 --> 1:13:11.193
What's up, bro?
Yo.

1:13:11.225 --> 1:13:12.460
Well, come on in.

1:13:12.493 --> 1:13:15.697
I been waitin'
for your fuckin' ass.

1:13:15.729 --> 1:13:17.331
Bro, I'm so sorry.

1:13:17.364 --> 1:13:18.567
Bro, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:13:18.599 --> 1:13:20.001
Please...

1:13:23.505 --> 1:13:26.742

Fuck, man.

Yo, I used to be
afraid of fuckin' needles, yo.

1:13:35.349 --> 1:13:39.086
You know how afraid I was
of needles, my nigga, yo.

1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:42.690
And you still put me on
and then you fuckin' left, yo!

1:13:42.724 --> 1:13:46.495
Man, fuck you, man!
Fuck you, nigga!

1:13:46.528 --> 1:13:48.530
Look, fuck, yo.
Come on.

1:13:48.563 --> 1:13:49.797
Look at me.
Look at me.

1:13:49.831 --> 1:13:52.701
This ain't you, bro.

1:13:52.733 --> 1:13:54.535
Please, nigga,
don't do this shit.

1:13:54.568 --> 1:13:56.772
Oh, fuck, please.
Yo, come on, yo.

1:13:56.804 --> 1:14:00.274
Who am I, yo?
Who am I?

1:14:00.308 --> 1:14:03.745
- Who are you?
- Yeah, yeah, who am I?

1:14:03.778 --> 1:14:08.750
Who am I, yo?
Who am I?

1:14:08.782 --> 1:14:11.620

1:14:11.653 --> 1:14:15.090
Fuckin' Dave.
Fuckin' Dave, yo.

1:14:15.122 --> 1:14:17.459
Yo, come on, yo.

1:14:17.492 --> 1:14:20.562
Who's been my best friend
through everything, hm?

1:14:20.595 --> 1:14:23.198
- Seven.
- Seven, Seven, yo.

1:14:23.230 --> 1:14:25.067
That's what the fuck
I'm talkin' 'bout, yo.

1:14:25.099 --> 1:14:27.835
Seven, who are you?
Who are you?

1:14:27.868 --> 1:14:29.804
Who are you, huh?
Come on.

1:14:29.837 --> 1:14:31.206
Look at me.
Look at me.

1:14:31.238 --> 1:14:34.108
- Who am I?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:14:34.142 --> 1:14:35.443
A demon.

1:14:39.514 --> 1:14:43.151
- I'm a demon.
- No, wait, wait.

1:14:43.184 --> 1:14:45.387
Wait, no.
No, you're not, yo.

1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:47.589
Wait.
Wait, wait, no!

1:14:47.621 --> 1:14:50.258
Hey, wait!
No, no, no!

Fuck!
Fuck!

1:15:07.608 --> 1:15:12.613
Fuck, fuck!

1:15:21.523 --> 1:15:26.395
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm Sev.

Fuck!

1:15:35.836 --> 1:15:39.241
Fuck!
Why, why, why?

1:15:44.946 --> 1:15:46.348
Fuck.

1:15:55.355 --> 1:15:56.757
Hey!
You free?

1:16:03.564 --> 1:16:05.200
It's done.

1:16:05.233 --> 1:16:08.270
You truly are
full surprises Mr. Max.

1:16:08.303 --> 1:16:09.904
And as for our agreement?

1:16:09.938 --> 1:16:11.907
Are you still
watching the building?

1:16:11.939 --> 1:16:13.308
Of course.

1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:15.843
The trunk of the car
that I showed up in.

1:16:15.876 --> 1:16:18.612
The keys are
in the apartment on the table.

1:16:18.645 --> 1:16:21.183
Very good.
Did you get your money?

1:18:01.815 --> 1:18:03.417
Sev?

1:18:07.087 --> 1:18:08.489
Hey, brother.

1:18:11.925 --> 1:18:16.897
So, um,
you go to school here?

1:18:16.930 --> 1:18:19.800
Yeah.

1:18:19.834 --> 1:18:23.404
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's my third year.

1:18:23.438 --> 1:18:26.440
You're a junior already?

1:18:26.474 --> 1:18:27.976
- Yeah, I, uh...
- Holy shit!

1:18:28.009 --> 1:18:29.810
...graduated early.
You know.

1:18:29.844 --> 1:18:31.746
That's good, man.

1:18:31.778 --> 1:18:35.015
That's really fucking good.
Wow, dude.

1:18:35.049 --> 1:18:36.951
What are you studying?

1:18:36.983 --> 1:18:39.321
Architecture.

1:18:39.354 --> 1:18:41.423
Wow!
Architecture?

1:18:42.523 --> 1:18:43.623
Holy fucking shit!

1:18:43.657 --> 1:18:47.361
My little brother's gonna be
a fuckin' architect, huh?

1:18:47.394 --> 1:18:52.099
I guess so.

1:18:52.132 --> 1:18:55.836
So...
What are you doing here?

1:18:55.870 --> 1:18:59.506
How did you even find me?

1:18:59.540 --> 1:19:01.876
I, um...

1:19:01.908 --> 1:19:05.714
I heard somewhere that you
were working in the library.

1:19:05.746 --> 1:19:10.384
So, uh,
I just wanted to come see

1:19:10.417 --> 1:19:11.920
how you were doin', bro.

1:19:15.422 --> 1:19:20.429
Oh, and, uh, yeah, I wanted
to give you a little something.

1:19:23.531 --> 1:19:25.966
It's a storage locker

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.703
registered under your name.

1:19:28.736 --> 1:19:30.104
Just, you know, use it

1:19:30.138 --> 1:19:34.975
to pay for school,
or to have fun.

1:19:35.009 --> 1:19:38.380
Whatever you want, man.

1:19:38.412 --> 1:19:41.715
- Sev, I don't... I don't need...
- No, listen, hey!

1:19:41.748 --> 1:19:45.120
Tristan, please, all right?
Listen to me.

1:19:45.153 --> 1:19:47.722
Just take it.
Okay?

1:19:47.755 --> 1:19:49.123
- Please.
- Okay.

1:19:49.157 --> 1:19:52.761
Okay.
Thank you.

1:19:59.634 --> 1:20:02.002
You okay?

1:20:02.036 --> 1:20:05.672
Yeah, man.
Yeah.

1:20:05.706 --> 1:20:07.142
I just love ya, you know?

1:20:12.145 --> 1:20:15.616
I mean, I've missed what like...

1:20:15.649 --> 1:20:18.719
..like five birthdays now?

1:20:18.752 --> 1:20:19.955
Yeah, yeah, I guess you did.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:29.096
All right,

1:20:29.130 --> 1:20:32.700
well I, um...

1:20:32.733 --> 1:20:35.203
I gotta get back out there.

1:20:35.236 --> 1:20:39.573
I got a hot date tonight.

1:20:39.607 --> 1:20:42.510
Keep doin'
what you're doin', Trist.

1:20:42.542 --> 1:20:44.879
Look at me.

1:20:44.912 --> 1:20:48.450
I'm really
fucking proud of you, man.

1:20:48.483 --> 1:20:50.685
You don't even
fuckin' know, kid.

1:20:56.189 --> 1:20:57.591
Sev, wait!

1:21:01.528 --> 1:21:04.498
Yeah?

1:21:04.532 --> 1:21:08.636
You wanna maybe
stop by here again sometime?

1:21:08.669 --> 1:21:12.573
So we can like
catch up or something?

1:21:12.607 --> 1:21:17.578
Yeah.
Maybe.

1:21:17.612 --> 1:21:20.815
You know me, man.

1:21:20.848 --> 1:21:24.152
If for some reason I can't,

1:21:24.184 --> 1:21:29.156
just know that
I'm rooting for you, bro.

1:21:29.189 --> 1:21:30.591
I'm sorry they kicked you out!

1:21:30.625 --> 1:21:33.828
No, I'm sorry.

1:21:33.861 --> 1:21:36.163
For everything.

1:21:36.197 --> 1:21:40.835
Don't you ever be sorry.
All right, Tristan?

1:21:40.867 --> 1:21:43.071
Because you didn't
do anything wrong, man.

1:21:43.104 --> 1:21:46.541
Nothin'!
You hear me?

1:21:55.215 --> 1:21:58.919
You're still
my brother, you know.

1:21:58.952 --> 1:22:00.488
Thanks, man.

1:22:06.059 --> 1:22:09.763
Fuck!

1:22:09.796 --> 1:22:12.799
Fuck.

1:22:12.832 --> 1:22:15.002
Fuck, man.
Come on, Sev.

1:22:15.036 --> 1:22:17.906
Come on.
Come on.

1:22:21.007 --> 1:22:23.178
Get a hold of yourself,
man, please.

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:47.301
It's time to get into character.

1:23:21.335 --> 1:23:22.737
She loves this one.

1:26:28.889 --> 1:26:30.992
Do you know who I am?

1:26:31.024 --> 1:26:33.294
You're dead.
You hear me?

1:26:36.095 --> 1:26:39.132
You?
Why?

1:26:57.283 --> 1:26:59.187
You were involved.

1:27:02.991 --> 1:27:04.892
- Hey, Creese.
- Sir.

1:27:04.925 --> 1:27:05.893
How you doin'?
What you got?

1:27:05.925 --> 1:27:07.495
We got multiple tenants
called in shots fired

1:27:07.528 --> 1:27:08.896
on the third floor.

1:27:08.929 --> 1:27:09.997
You got
a positive location?

1:27:10.029 --> 1:27:12.599
No, but the doorman,
he seems to think it was 306.

1:27:12.632 --> 1:27:14.803
Said the guy
came in tonight acting strange.

1:27:41.194 --> 1:27:42.929
All right,
this is probably our guy.

1:27:42.962 --> 1:27:44.465
Guys, let's go to work!
Come on.

1:28:01.514 --> 1:28:03.383
NYPD!
Open the door now!

1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:09.122
I think we're gonna make it.

1:28:14.394 --> 1:28:17.898
- All right, your turn.
- My turn for what?

1:28:17.931 --> 1:28:19.200
Come on.
Don't be an ass!

1:28:19.233 --> 1:28:22.236
- How do you wanna die?
- I told you already.

1:28:22.269 --> 1:28:23.471
- Balls deep...
- No, don't be gross!

1:28:23.504 --> 1:28:26.573
Come on, seriously.
I told you.

1:28:26.607 --> 1:28:27.975
Please?

1:28:28.007 --> 1:28:29.309
All right, all right.

1:28:32.345 --> 1:28:33.547
So?

1:28:35.549 --> 1:28:38.085
With style of course.

1:28:38.117 --> 1:28:39.586
In a hail of gun fire.

1:28:42.389 --> 1:28:44.592
Dang, baby.
That's pretty cool.

1:28:44.625 --> 1:28:46.261
Yeah.

1:29:07.281 --> 1:29:08.983
Truer words, doll.

1:29:09.015 --> 1:29:10.183
Drop the weapon!

1:29:10.216 --> 1:29:11.384
Truer words.

1:29:11.417 --> 1:29:16.424
Drop it!

1:29:47.453 --> 1:29:49.590
Hey, doll.

1:29:49.622 --> 1:29:51.024
Hey.
