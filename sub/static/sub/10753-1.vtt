00:09.801 --> 00:11.951
Listen to yourself, Bob.

00:12.220 --> 00:16.338
You follow her to work. You eavesdrop
on her calls. You open her mail.

00:16.683 --> 00:20.119
When you started doing these things,
the relationship was over.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.315
Thank you for your call.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.881
Roz, we have time for one more.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.587
Yes. On line four,
we have Russell from Kirkland.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.300
Hello, Russell, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.

00:34.617 --> 00:39.532
'I've been feeling sort of,
you know, depressed lately.

00:39.914 --> 00:43.384
'My life's not going anywhere.
It's not that bad.

00:43.710 --> 00:48.261
'It's just, same old apartment,
same old job. Sometimes...'

00:48.631 --> 00:50.587
We're at the end of our hour.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.517
I'll cut to the chase
by using myself as an example.

00:54.846 --> 00:58.441
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.203
My wife had left me, which was
very painful.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.479
Then she came back to me,
which was excruciating.

01:10.487 --> 01:14.275
On top of that,
my practice had grown stagnant

01:14.616 --> 01:19.565
and my social life consisted
of hanging around a bar every night.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.909
I was clinging to a life
that wasn't working.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.598
I knew I had to do something, anything.

01:26.878 --> 01:31.668
So I ended the marriage and moved
back here to my hometown of Seattle.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.200
Go, Seahawks!

01:34.469 --> 01:37.381
I took action, Russell, and you can too.

01:37.681 --> 01:42.311
Move, change, do something.
If it's a mistake, do something else.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.995
Will you do that, Russell?

01:45.855 --> 01:47.686
Will you?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.409
Russell? I think we lost him.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.413
No, we cut to the news
30 seconds ago.

01:56.991 --> 01:59.186
Oh, for crying out loud!

01:59.452 --> 02:01.408
I bare my soul to Seattle.

02:01.663 --> 02:04.939
They're listening to
Chopper Dave's Rush Hour Roundup!

02:06.710 --> 02:11.386
The rest of the show was pretty good.
It was a good show, wasn't it?

02:11.756 --> 02:13.712
Your brother called.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.926
We call that "avoidance". Don't change
the subject. Tell me what you think.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.697
Did I ever tell you
what this button does?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.930
I am not a piece of Lalique.

02:23.184 --> 02:26.654
I can handle criticism.
How was I today?

02:26.980 --> 02:31.292
You dropped two commercials,
left a total of 28 seconds of dead air,

02:31.651 --> 02:34.563
scrambled the call letters,
spilt yoghurt on the control board,

02:34.863 --> 02:38.617
and you kept referring to Jerry,
with the identity crisis, as "Jeff".

02:44.706 --> 02:46.936
You say my brother called?

02:51.421 --> 02:55.573
So I said to the gardener,
"Yoshi, I do not want a Zen garden.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.883
"lf I want to rake gravel
every ten minutes for inner harmony,

02:59.179 --> 03:01.329
"I'll move to Yokohama."

03:01.598 --> 03:05.477
This offends him, so he starts
pulling up Maris' prized camellias.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.846
I couldn't stand for that.

03:08.104 --> 03:12.256
I marched inside and locked the door
until he cooled down.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.897
Would you have handled it differently?

03:17.197 --> 03:20.348
Sorry, Niles.
I didn't realise you'd stopped talking.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
You haven't heard a word!

03:22.786 --> 03:24.742
You're a shrink. You know how it is

03:24.996 --> 03:27.590
when people go on
about their mundane lives.

03:27.874 --> 03:32.106
Touché. And on that subject,
I heard your show today.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.735
- And?
- You know my view of pop psychiatry.

03:41.012 --> 03:45.642
And everything. When was the last
time you had an unexpressed thought?

03:46.017 --> 03:48.485
I'm having one now.

03:49.479 --> 03:53.028
- You guys ready?
- Two cafelatte supremos.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.988
No, thank you.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.888
So, Frasier,
how are you doing on your own?

04:08.206 --> 04:11.039
I'm fine. I love my new life.

04:11.334 --> 04:15.122
I love the solitude.
I miss Frederick, of course.

04:15.463 --> 04:21.413
He's playing goalie on the pee-wee
soccer team. Chip off the old block.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.678
- You hated sports.
- So does he!

04:26.558 --> 04:29.356
The fresh air's good for him.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.760
Well, this has been fun.

04:32.022 --> 04:36.698
- There's a problem we should discuss.
- Is it Dad?

04:37.068 --> 04:39.502
One of his old police buddies called.

04:39.779 --> 04:43.294
He went to see him
and found him on the bathroom floor.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.686
- Oh, my God!
- He's fine.

04:45.952 --> 04:50.867
- Is it his hip again?
- I don't think he can live alone now.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.558
What can we do?

04:53.835 --> 04:57.145
This won't be anyone's
favourite solution,

04:57.464 --> 05:01.457
but I took the liberty of checking out
a few convalescent homes for him.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.076
A home? He's still a young man.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.624
You can't take care of him.
You're getting your new life together.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.364
We were never <i>simpatico.</i>

05:11.644 --> 05:13.874
Of course, I can't take care of him.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.583
Oh, yes, of course. Why?

05:17.901 --> 05:20.813
- Dad doesn't get along with Maris.
- Who does?

05:21.112 --> 05:23.751
I thought you liked my Maris.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.388
I do. I like her from a distance.

05:27.702 --> 05:31.217
You know, the way you like the sun.
Maris is like the sun,

05:31.539 --> 05:33.848
except without the warmth.

05:37.545 --> 05:41.379
Well, then, we're agreed
about what to do with Dad.

05:41.716 --> 05:45.629
"Golden Acres.
We care so you don't have to."

05:51.184 --> 05:54.142
- It says that?
- It might as well.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.297
OK, I'll make up the spare bedroom.

05:58.566 --> 06:02.923
- You're a good son, Frasier.
- Oh, God, I am, aren't l?

06:03.279 --> 06:05.509
Two cafe supremos. Anything to eat?

06:05.782 --> 06:08.580
No, I seem to have lost my appetite.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.938
I'll have a large piece of cheesecake.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.074

06:19.838 --> 06:23.148
(He plays passionately)

06:23.466 --> 06:25.422
(Doorbell)

06:45.363 --> 06:48.719
- Hi!
- We finally made it.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.468
Dad, welcome to your new home.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.543
Gee, you look great.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.299
Don't BS me.
I do not look great.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.540
I spent Monday on the bathroom floor.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.467
You can still see
the tile marks on my face.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.946
Gives you some idea
about the ride over here.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.534
Here we are.

07:11.306 --> 07:15.857
Rest assured. The refrigerator
is stocked with your favourite beer.

07:16.227 --> 07:20.186
We've got hot links and coleslaw
and I rented a Charles Bronson movie.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.356
Cut the speech.
We all know why I'm here.

07:23.651 --> 07:28.281
I can't be alone without falling
on my ass and you're stuck with me.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.172
No, no!

07:33.286 --> 07:36.039
We have a chance to get reacquainted.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.243
That implies we were acquainted
at one point.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.760
Why don't I take Dad's things
into his new bachelor quarters

07:49.094 --> 07:52.052
so you scoundrels
can plan some high jinks?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.362
That wife of his is driving him nutso.

07:56.643 --> 08:01.319
Yes, we Crane boys
sure know how to marry.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.506
Let me get you a beer, Dad.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.135
What do you think
of what I've done with the place?

08:11.449 --> 08:16.569
Every item was carefully selected.
This lamp by Corbu, chair by Eames.

08:16.955 --> 08:21.824
This couch is a replica of the one
Coco Chanel had in her Paris atelier.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.203
- Nothing matches.
- It's a style of decorating. It's eclectic.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.322
If you've got
really fine pieces of furniture,

08:31.636 --> 08:35.072
it doesn't matter if they match.
They will go together.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.620
It's your money.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.869
(Doorbell)

08:41.104 --> 08:43.823
Hey, that's the Space Needle there.

08:44.107 --> 08:48.498
Thanks for pointing that out. Being born
and raised here, I never woulda known.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.239
- Delivery for Martin Crane.
- In here.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.843
Excuse me! Wait a minute!

08:57.120 --> 08:59.350
- Where do you want it?
- Where's the TV?

08:59.622 --> 09:01.977
- In that credenza.
- Point it at that.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.287
- What about this chair?
- I'll move it.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.260
Careful! That's a Wassily!

09:09.466 --> 09:11.980
Dad, I'm sure this piece is dear to you,

09:12.260 --> 09:14.854
but I don't think
it goes with anything here.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.857
I know. It's eclectic.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.999
Niles, will you help me out here?

09:23.271 --> 09:26.866
I need an extension cord
to plug in the vibrating part.

09:27.192 --> 09:30.309
Yes, that will be the crowning touch.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.232
Now you're settled in, I've got to run.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.008
I'm late for my
dysfunctional family seminar.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.766
Dad, have you mentioned Eddie yet?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.873
- Eddie?
- Ta-ta.

09:46.127 --> 09:50.564
- No, not Eddie!
- He's my best friend. Get me my beer.

09:50.924 --> 09:55.918
He's weird. He gives me the creeps.
All he does is stare at me.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.382
It's your imagination.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.918
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
Eddie is not moving in here.

10:04.062 --> 10:08.499
(Suspense music on TV)

10:10.944 --> 10:13.538
(Screams and a gunshot)

10:24.541 --> 10:27.294
Niles, sorry I'm late.

10:27.585 --> 10:32.534
As I was leaving, Dad decided to cook
lunch by the glow of a small kitchen fire.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.121
This last week with Dad,
it's been a living hell.

10:36.428 --> 10:40.501
Either my territory's being violated
or I worry about what he's up to.

10:40.849 --> 10:45.639
I'm a nervous wreck. I must calm down.
Double espresso, please.

10:46.021 --> 10:50.617
You don't still have the brochures
from those...those rest homes, do you?

10:50.984 --> 10:55.421
Of course I do. Don't forget,
Maris is five years older than I am.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.047
You really think that's necessary?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.364
Yes. I don't have my life any more.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.815
I gave up my tickets to the theatre,
to the symphony....

11:08.126 --> 11:09.798
What about the opera?

11:10.045 --> 11:12.843
- Here.
- Thank you.

11:15.050 --> 11:19.840
You don't suppose there's a chance
that you and Maris could..?

11:20.221 --> 11:25.818
Maris and I were discussing this. We
should share the responsibility more.

11:26.227 --> 11:31.142
- You mean you'd take him in?
- Dear God, no!

11:31.524 --> 11:34.482
We'll help you pay
for a home care worker.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.612
Someone to cook, clean and
help Dad with his physical therapy.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.542
These angels exist?

11:41.826 --> 11:45.182
I know an agency.
I'll ask them to send a few people over.

11:46.665 --> 11:52.137
Niles, I can't thank you enough.
I feel this urge to hug you.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.424
Remember what Mom always said.
"A handshake is as good as a hug."

11:58.635 --> 12:00.591
Wise woman.

12:02.097 --> 12:06.056
I have never been more impressed
with a human being in my life.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.997
- What was wrong with that one?
- She was casing the joint.

12:12.357 --> 12:16.145
Casing the joint! She spent
two years with Mother Teresa.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.365
If I were Mother Teresa,
I'd check my jewellery box.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.411
(Doorbell)

12:24.661 --> 12:28.256
This is the last one.
Try to keep an open mind.

12:28.581 --> 12:33.336
(English accent) Hello.
Caught with me hand in the biscuit tin!

12:33.712 --> 12:37.864
- I'm Daphne. Daphne Moon.
- Frasier Crane. Please come in.

12:38.216 --> 12:42.209
My father, Martin Crane.
Dad, this is Daphne Moon.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.944
Nice to meet you.
Oh, and who might this be?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.826
That is Eddie.

12:52.564 --> 12:55.636
- I call him Eddie Spaghetti.
- He likes pasta?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.898
No, he has worms.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.689
- Have a seat, Miss Moon.
- Daphne. Thank you.

13:08.455 --> 13:14.052
Will you look at that?
What a comfy chair. I always say,

13:14.461 --> 13:17.976
"Start with a good piece, and
replace the rest when you can afford it."

13:25.847 --> 13:29.965
Perhaps you should start
by telling us about yourself.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.508
- I'm from Manchester, England.
- Really? Did you hear that, Dad?

13:34.856 --> 13:38.849
I'm three feet away.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

13:40.278 --> 13:44.066
I've only been in the US
for a few months,

13:44.407 --> 13:49.401
but I have an extensive background
in home care and physical therapy,

13:49.788 --> 13:52.780
as you can see from my résumé.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.199
You were a policeman, weren't you?

13:55.460 --> 14:01.137
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I must confess I'm a bit psychic.

14:03.218 --> 14:07.257
It's nothing big.
Just little things I sense about people.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.713
It's not like I could pick the lottery.

14:09.974 --> 14:14.206
If I could, I wouldn't be talking
to the likes of you two now, would l?

14:15.105 --> 14:18.780
Yes.
Perhaps I should describe your duties.

14:19.109 --> 14:23.864
Wait. I'm getting something on you.
You're a florist.

14:27.117 --> 14:32.145
- No, I'm a psychiatrist.
- Well, it comes and goes.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.578
Usually it's strongest
during my time of the month.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.149
I guess I let a little secret out there.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.499
It's safe with us.

14:44.801 --> 14:49.158
We've learned all we need to know
about you. And a dash extra.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.472
You're a dog, aren't you?

14:58.523 --> 15:00.878
Well, we'll be calling you, Miss Moon.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.790
- You got the job.
- Wonderful!

15:04.070 --> 15:09.303
Aren't you forgetting something?
Shouldn't we talk about this in private?

15:09.701 --> 15:14.536
Of course. I completely understand.
I'll just pop into the loo.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.303
- You do have one, don't you?
- Yes.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.337
Oh, I love America.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.834
- Dad!
- You wanted me to pick one.

15:26.134 --> 15:31.208
- She's a kook. I don't like her.
- She'll only be here when you're not.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.112
Then what's my problem?

15:35.393 --> 15:36.872
Daphne!

15:37.103 --> 15:41.654
- You've been retained.
- Oh, wonderful! I had a premonition.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.061
Quelle surprise.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.197
I'll move my things in tomorrow.

15:47.489 --> 15:51.846
There must be some misunderstanding.
This isn't a live-in position.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.318
The lady at the agency...

15:54.579 --> 15:58.811
She was wrong. This is
a part-time position. It won't work out.

15:59.167 --> 16:02.796
- Let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to discuss.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.007
You should talk about this.
I'll just pop back in here

16:06.299 --> 16:09.371
and enjoy your African erotic art.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.710
- I think it would be best if you leave.
- Oh, all right.

16:15.058 --> 16:20.086
We'll contact you. If not by telephone,
then through the toaster.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.866
- I'm not having her living here.
- Why not?

16:31.199 --> 16:34.236
- There's no room for her!
- What about your study?

16:34.536 --> 16:38.609
That's where I read,
where I do my most profound thinking.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.427
Use the can like the rest of the world.

16:44.546 --> 16:45.501
You'll adjust.

16:45.714 --> 16:50.265
I've done enough adjusting.
I'm in a new city, I've got a new job.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.672
I'm separated from my little boy.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.725
And now my father
and his dog are living with me.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.089
The whole idea
of getting somebody in here

17:00.395 --> 17:02.704
was to help ease my burden,
not to add to it.

17:02.981 --> 17:06.940
- Eddie, we're a burden.
- You're twisting my words.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.633
I meant burden
in its most positive sense.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.825
As in "Gee, what a lovely burden"?

17:14.117 --> 17:18.156
- Something like that.
- It's not only you who got screwed.

17:18.496 --> 17:22.967
Two years ago, some punk
robbing a store put a bullet in my hip.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.133
I traded in my golf clubs
for one of these.

17:26.421 --> 17:31.449
I had plans, too. This may be a shock,
but one of them wasn't living with you.

17:31.843 --> 17:35.631
- I'm just trying to be the good son.
- Don't worry.

17:35.972 --> 17:40.568
- After I'm gone, you can live guilt-free.
- You think this is about guilt?

17:40.977 --> 17:45.607
- Isn't it?
- Of course it is! But I took you in.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.452
I wanted to do it
because you're my father!

17:50.612 --> 17:52.728
And how do you repay me?

17:52.989 --> 17:56.777
With a snide comment about this
or a smart little putdown about that.

17:57.118 --> 18:00.394
I've done my best to make a home
here for you.

18:00.705 --> 18:05.654
Just once would it have killed
you to say one lousy "thank you"?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.818
Come on, Eddie,
it's past your dinner time.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.753
I'm going out.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.752
They have got to move the bathroom
closer to the studio!

18:40.078 --> 18:44.708
We'll be back after these messages.
Can't I put that on tape?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.421
What's eating you?

18:49.713 --> 18:53.786
Sorry. It's this thing with my father
and this person he wants to hire.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.649
I thought I'd started my life
with a clean slate.

18:57.971 --> 19:02.328
I had a picture of what it was going
to be like and then... I don't know.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.640
Ever heard of Lupe Velez?

19:04.894 --> 19:08.773
- Who?
- Lupe Velez. A movie star in the '30s.

19:10.984 --> 19:15.614
Her career hit the skids so she decided
to make one final stab at immortality.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.380
She figured she'd at least be
remembered for the way she died.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.258
All Lupe wanted
was to be remembered.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.177
So she plans this lavish suicide.

19:26.458 --> 19:31.248
Flowers, candles, silk sheet,
white satin gown, full hair and make-up.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.985
She takes the overdose of pills,
lays on the bed

19:35.300 --> 19:40.328
and imagines how beautiful
she'll look on tomorrow's front page.

19:40.722 --> 19:44.874
Unfortunately, the pills don't set well
with the enchilada combo plate

19:45.226 --> 19:47.456
she sadly chose as her last meal.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.103
She trips in the bathroom,

19:51.358 --> 19:54.395
goes head-first into the toilet.
That's how they found her.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.407
Is there a reason
you're telling me this story?

19:59.699 --> 20:05.854
Yes. Even if things may not happen like
we planned, they can work out anyway.

20:07.707 --> 20:13.703
Remind me of how it worked for Lupe,
last seen with her head in the toilet.

20:14.130 --> 20:18.806
All she wanted was to be remembered.
Will you ever forget that story?

20:23.515 --> 20:26.712
We're back. Roz, who's our next caller?

20:27.018 --> 20:31.773
We have Martin on line one.
He's having a problem with his son.

20:33.692 --> 20:37.480
Hello, Martin. This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.972
(Martin Crane) 'I'm a first-time caller.'

20:45.620 --> 20:49.454
Welcome to the show.
How can I help you?

20:49.791 --> 20:54.546
'l moved in with my son,
and it ain't working.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.355
'There's a lot of tension between us.'

20:57.632 --> 21:01.102
I can imagine.
Why do you think that's so?

21:01.428 --> 21:05.387
'l guess I didn't see he had
a whole new life planned for himself.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.680
'l kind of got in the way.'

21:07.934 --> 21:10.494
These things are a two-way street.

21:10.770 --> 21:15.844
Perhaps your son wasn't sensitive
in seeing how your life was changing.

21:16.234 --> 21:21.149
'You've got that right! I've been telling
him that ever since I got there!'

21:21.531 --> 21:24.284
I'm sure he appreciated your candour.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.965
'Sometimes
I oughta keep my trap shut.'

21:27.245 --> 21:30.203
That's good advice for us all.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.914
Anything else?

21:34.169 --> 21:39.004
'I'm worried my son doesn't know that
I appreciate what he's done for me.'

21:39.382 --> 21:41.338
Why don't you tell him?

21:41.593 --> 21:43.549
'You know how it is
with fathers and sons.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.158
'They have trouble saying that stuff.'

21:46.431 --> 21:51.744
Well, if it helps, I suspect
your son already knows how you feel.

21:55.982 --> 22:00.134
- Is that all?
- 'Yeah. Thank you, Dr Crane.'

22:00.487 --> 22:03.365
- My pleasure, Martin.
- 'You hear that? I said thank you!'

22:03.656 --> 22:06.329
Yes, I heard.

22:10.997 --> 22:16.947
Dr Crane? Claire on line four is having
a problem getting over a relationship.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.603
Hello, Claire. I'm listening.

22:21.883 --> 22:24.272
'I'm, er...

22:24.552 --> 22:27.385
(Sobs) 'Well, I'm a mess!

22:27.681 --> 22:32.038
'Eight months ago my boyfriend and l
broke up. I just can't get over it.

22:32.435 --> 22:37.828
'The pain isn't going away. It's like
I'm in mourning or something.'

22:38.233 --> 22:41.782
Claire, you are in mourning.

22:42.112 --> 22:45.661
But you're not mourning
the loss of your boyfriend.

22:45.991 --> 22:51.509
You're mourning the loss of what
you thought your life was going to be.

22:51.913 --> 22:56.225
Let it go. Things don't always
work out how you plan.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.576
That's not necessarily bad.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.269
Things have a way
of working out anyway.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.947
Have you ever heard of Lupe Velez?

23:13.560 --> 23:18.315
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

23:19.441 --> 23:20.396
# Oh, my!

23:20.608 --> 23:23.680
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...

23:23.987 --> 23:27.423
# But I got you pegged!

23:27.741 --> 23:33.259
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

23:33.663 --> 23:35.654
# They're calling again #

23:36.374 --> 23:38.569
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
