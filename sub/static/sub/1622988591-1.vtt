[Abe] Four score and seven years ago,

To be true to my family, my friends,
and the Republic for which they stand,

02:02.208 --> 02:07.708

would be the end of you.

04:11.041 --> 04:14.500

be willing to take that chance.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.708
Yes, you have.

04:21.791 --> 04:24.541
The only problem is
you assumed, all this time,

04:24.625 --> 04:27.958
that I'm part of your "we," when, in fact,

04:28.041 --> 04:31.416
I'm with a different "we," now.

that you're embracing your true self.

We couldn't have been any more different.
And yet, he opened up his arms to me

any shot at this at all,

22:09.375 --> 22:12.458
we need more pledges.
I'm talking real heavy hitters.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.416
Oh, you know what?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.291
I heard they got a sorcerer
in the square, lighting it up tonight.

22:16.375 --> 22:17.208
[indistinct chatter]

22:17.291 --> 22:18.541
[man] Wanted in all--

22:18.625 --> 22:21.208
[Samuel] Oh, "lighting it up."
[chuckles] Okay.

22:21.291 --> 22:26.291
Having committed heresy in the eyes
of our Lord and Savior, King James,

22:26.375 --> 22:29.916
the condemned
is found guilty of the crimes of…

22:30.000 --> 22:33.666
creating a hypothesis,
testing that hypothesis,

22:33.750 --> 22:37.250
and drawing conclusions
that refine that hypothesis.

22:37.333 --> 22:42.208
Thomas Edison, for these crimes
of practicing science-craft,

22:42.291 --> 22:47.000
you are hereby sentenced to death by fire.

22:47.083 --> 22:48.333
[townspeople booing]

22:49.291 --> 22:50.125
[chains jingle]

22:53.708 --> 22:56.500
Well, shit. What are we gonna do now?

22:56.583 --> 22:57.625
Uh… oh!

22:57.708 --> 23:00.750
How do you feel about endurance magicians?

23:00.833 --> 23:01.875
[bubbling, exploding]

23:01.958 --> 23:03.041
Oh, my God!

23:03.125 --> 23:05.583
-[woman screaming]
-The demon is resistant to fire-- Oh!

23:07.208 --> 23:08.208
[indistinct shouting]

23:09.875 --> 23:11.250
[electricity buzzing]

23:20.291 --> 23:22.333
Wow! This guy, am I right?

23:22.416 --> 23:24.875
-I vote we never piss him off.
-[both] Agreed.

23:24.958 --> 23:25.958
Vote passed.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.916
-[all] Fuckin' democracy!
-[eagle screeches]

23:28.000 --> 23:28.833
We're doin' it!

23:30.833 --> 23:33.166
Thomas Edison, you are said to be

23:33.250 --> 23:35.875
the preeminent sorcerer
in all the colonies,

23:35.958 --> 23:38.166
eons ahead of all your contemporaries.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.333
We seek to recruit you for a mission.

23:40.416 --> 23:43.291
We literally cannot succeed without you!

23:43.375 --> 23:44.416
What the--

23:44.500 --> 23:46.833
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you expecting someone else?

23:46.916 --> 23:49.958
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. It's a chick.
It's a chick!

23:50.041 --> 23:52.958
I'm sorry. There's been
a bit of a mix-up, I think?

23:53.041 --> 23:54.416
Yeah, no such luck, dorks.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.833
You're looking for Thomas Edison,
ya got her.

23:56.916 --> 23:58.750
But Thomas is a man's name.

23:58.833 --> 24:02.333
I mean, my name is Thomas, so…

24:02.416 --> 24:05.750
Impossible! I have to say the obvious.

24:05.833 --> 24:08.750
-What is wrong with your skin?
-What's wrong with my skin?

24:08.833 --> 24:10.291
What is wrong… I'm sorry.

24:10.375 --> 24:13.708
[yelling] What is wrong with your skin?

24:13.791 --> 24:15.875
Whoa! Bro, take it easy.

24:15.958 --> 24:17.416
Don't worry, I can handle this.

24:17.500 --> 24:21.458
There is nothing wrong with my skin.
I'm Chinese.

24:21.541 --> 24:23.125
-Huh?
-I'm from China.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.958
-Huh?
-I'm an immigrant.

24:25.041 --> 24:27.416
I came here from another country.
Like you.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.791
Oh, no! No, no, no.

24:29.875 --> 24:31.958
My people have always been here.

24:32.041 --> 24:35.000
That's why we make the rules, baby!

24:35.083 --> 24:36.833
[scoffs] Except you don't, dumbass.

24:36.916 --> 24:38.666
Ooh, you got burned!

24:38.750 --> 24:40.416
Isn't that why you've come to me?

24:40.500 --> 24:42.333
Because you need help
toppling the British?

24:42.416 --> 24:45.583
Yes! [chuckles] Exactly! That is…
Wait, how did you know that?

24:45.666 --> 24:48.458
Word travels fast in these parts,
George Washington with an "O."

24:48.541 --> 24:50.833
I… I don't know.
Now that I'm thinking about it,

24:50.916 --> 24:54.125
sorcerers are so 1775, am I right?

24:54.208 --> 24:56.291
Cool, because I'm not a sorcerer.

24:56.375 --> 24:57.791
I'm a scientist.

24:57.875 --> 24:59.208
[laughing]

25:00.416 --> 25:02.583
There's no such thing as science.

25:02.666 --> 25:05.875
Oh, my God, did you guys hear that?

25:05.958 --> 25:08.333
-Really? No such thing as science, huh?
-[Samuel] Yeah.

25:08.416 --> 25:09.791
Then what do you call this?

25:09.875 --> 25:12.000
Science!

25:12.666 --> 25:14.041
-[exploding]
-[all] Oh! Wow!

25:14.125 --> 25:16.958
-Yay!
-Yeah, I call them conduction gloves.

25:17.041 --> 25:20.208
The science is simple, really.
They harness the subatomic--

25:20.291 --> 25:23.250
Oh, wait, no, don't tell us, dude.
That's gonna ruin the trick.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.041
Yeah, it's more fun not to know!

25:25.125 --> 25:27.750
Okay, guys, let's put our heads
together here on this one.

25:27.833 --> 25:30.208
There's gotta be
another Thomas Edison, right?

25:30.291 --> 25:31.708
Like a man Thomas Edison.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.375
Oh, yeah, there is.
There's Thomas Edisen with an "E,"

25:34.458 --> 25:36.000
the professional wrestler.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.666
Ah, that's him. Let's go get him.

25:37.750 --> 25:40.125
He's cool. Big dude.
Wears spandex, if you're into that.

25:40.208 --> 25:43.625
But he can't help you
defeat an entire army. I can.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.625
You would stand with us
against the British?

25:45.708 --> 25:48.833
[inhales] Bet your ass. Those guys suck.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.416
I'm just doing science.

25:50.500 --> 25:53.125
And because they don't understand it,
they want to kill me?

25:53.208 --> 25:54.708
Man, fuck those dicks.

25:54.791 --> 25:57.000
Science is supposed to be fun
and they're ruining it.

25:57.083 --> 25:59.458
Yeah, right?
We even call 'em the fun police.

25:59.541 --> 26:02.041
[chuckling] Oh, man, that's good.
Can I use that?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.291
Uh, no.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.166
Problem. No problem.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.625
So, Edison,
you're obviously a great thinker.

26:07.708 --> 26:08.875
What would you have us do now?

26:08.958 --> 26:11.125
[scoffs] James has got eyes
and ears everywhere.

26:11.208 --> 26:12.875
If we're gonna blow up his spot,

26:12.958 --> 26:15.250
we need someone
who knows this land better than James.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.416
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.375
You can't possibly be suggesting--

26:19.916 --> 26:22.541
[narrator] He was a tracker,
best in the world,

26:22.625 --> 26:26.500
until he was sent to a British prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.541
Now, he prowls the badlands,

26:28.625 --> 26:31.250
tracking for those
who can't track for themselves.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.708
If you have a problem
and you can find him,

26:33.791 --> 26:36.416
-maybe you can hire Geronimo.
-[eagle screeches]

26:36.500 --> 26:37.333
[engine revving]

26:41.125 --> 26:42.250
[sniffs]

26:54.166 --> 26:55.083
[growls]

27:04.250 --> 27:06.375
All right, what do you chuds want?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.125
Hey, you play lax, bro?

27:08.208 --> 27:09.500
Seth-chee.

27:09.583 --> 27:12.208
My people invented lacrosse,
all right, bro?

27:12.291 --> 27:14.500
[chuckles] Sure, man. Sure.

27:14.583 --> 27:17.750
We come as friends, mighty Geronimo…

27:17.833 --> 27:19.458
Nay, nay, we come as brothers.

27:19.541 --> 27:22.958
Mmm, Just doesn't feel right.
Feels like you're gonna try to fuck me.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.583
What? We wouldn't, never!

27:24.666 --> 27:27.625
Yeah, no, I think you might.

27:27.708 --> 27:31.000
Like, epically,
all the way down to my descendants.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.083
I got a sixth sense for this shit.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.833
No, our word is strong,

27:34.916 --> 27:38.291
like your mighty Indian tribe,
the, um… the…

27:38.875 --> 27:40.000
Ch…

27:40.083 --> 27:41.083
No.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.125
The Chicory?

27:43.208 --> 27:44.625
Kay yay.

27:44.708 --> 27:45.666
Squa…

27:45.750 --> 27:48.541
Sha… Sass… Sasquatch! Sasquatch.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.333
-Gotta be Sasquatch. There we go.
-Yes.

27:50.416 --> 27:53.750
Our word is strong,
like your mighty tribe, the Sasquatch.

27:53.833 --> 27:56.458
[groans] Fine. What do you want?

27:56.541 --> 27:59.000
-We seek to topple the British.
-I'm in.

27:59.083 --> 28:00.958
-Now, hear us out--
-Again, I'm in.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.666
-Not sure how much you know about them.
-Uh, quite a bit.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.416
They are really, really shitty buzzkills.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.958
-Really?
-Yeah, we call them, get this, here…

28:09.041 --> 28:11.416
-Ready? The fun police.
-"The fun police"?

28:11.500 --> 28:13.750
Yeah. They all have all these rules.

28:13.833 --> 28:16.416
No one's allowed to have
a single independent thought,

28:16.500 --> 28:18.541
and they're always taxing
the shit out of everybody!

28:18.625 --> 28:20.208
Yeah, that sounds rough.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.583
[sniffs] My issue
is just that they took my land,

28:22.666 --> 28:24.500
poisoned my people
to the brink of extinction,

28:24.583 --> 28:26.583
and murdered everyone I've ever cared for.

28:26.666 --> 28:28.750
So… real buzzkill.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.833
That is classic fun police.
Those guys have no chill.

28:31.916 --> 28:33.083
-Right?
-Chief Geronimo--

28:33.166 --> 28:34.875
-Just Geronimo is fine.
-Just Geronimo--

28:34.958 --> 28:35.791
Oh, God.

28:35.875 --> 28:38.083
We can't give you back your family.

28:38.166 --> 28:42.916
But join us and I promise you
justice will finally be served.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.291
So, you're telling me that if I help you,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.375
when you win this land
back from King James,

28:47.458 --> 28:49.125
you'll give it back to me and my family?

28:49.208 --> 28:51.333
-Absolutely.
-[chuckles] Totally.

28:51.416 --> 28:52.416
[clears throat]

28:53.208 --> 28:55.750
-All of it? The whole enchilada?
-Well, I mean--

28:55.833 --> 28:57.166
[chuckles] Yeah, you bet we will.

28:57.250 --> 28:59.583
Sam, man, can I get
a quick sidebar with you?

28:59.666 --> 29:02.166
You know what?
I'm probably just being paranoid.

29:02.250 --> 29:05.500
So, what's the plan now,
and does it involve Doritos?

29:05.583 --> 29:06.875
Nope, better.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.583
A handkerchief.

29:08.666 --> 29:11.791
[foghorn blaring]

29:18.666 --> 29:20.541
[ominous music playing]

29:34.125 --> 29:35.625
[Benedict] Greetings, Your Highness.

29:35.708 --> 29:38.541
May I be the first to welcome you
to your New World?

29:38.625 --> 29:42.500
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Arnold.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.291
Such as they are.

29:44.375 --> 29:47.541
Yes, and this is,
like, the nice part of town.

29:47.625 --> 29:51.125
Well, it smells like shit,
which reminds me,

29:51.208 --> 29:53.541
I need to make room for second breakfast.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.833
I've had my fill
of mushy peas and blood sausage.

29:56.916 --> 29:59.458
[Benedict] Yes, accommodations
at the top of your obelisk

29:59.541 --> 30:01.000
are more well-suited, my king.

30:01.083 --> 30:05.833
Then, I can assume everything
is proceeding as I have foreseen.

30:05.916 --> 30:07.875
Yes, your plan is proceeding.

30:07.958 --> 30:09.333
But we have had trouble

30:09.416 --> 30:12.166
with a certain colonist
not falling in line.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.416
Well, has he read the rules?

30:15.125 --> 30:19.416
The rules should always
be posted clearly in a public place

30:19.500 --> 30:21.875
where everyone can read them.

30:21.958 --> 30:24.500
Oh, can he… can he not read?

30:24.583 --> 30:27.583
Well, no, he has read them, Your Highness.

30:27.666 --> 30:30.666
However, he has chosen not to follow them.

30:30.750 --> 30:34.041
-[sputtering] But they are the rules!
-I know!

30:34.125 --> 30:38.875
What is the point of being a ruler
if people are not following your rules?

30:38.958 --> 30:41.083
This is, like, King Shit 101!

30:41.166 --> 30:43.041
I understand, my king.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.291
Not following the…

30:44.375 --> 30:47.625
[voice trembling] Arnold,
why, do you know what this is?

30:47.708 --> 30:50.666
-I do.
-It's rebellion!

30:50.750 --> 30:51.708
By definition.

30:51.791 --> 30:55.500
We cannot allow anything
to stop my plan, Arnold!

30:55.583 --> 30:58.250
Crush this illiterate rebel scum!

30:58.333 --> 31:00.416
It will be my pleasure.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.625
Excellent.

31:04.583 --> 31:07.416
[Samuel] Dudes, are we close yet?
I'm getting hangry.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.583
I could definitely eat.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.375
Oh, I saw a Boston Wild Wings
about a mile back.

31:11.458 --> 31:12.583
What's a mile?

31:12.666 --> 31:15.083
And I could totally
crush some B-dubs right now.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.416
Hey, hey! Knock it off, guys.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.583
First, we start a revolution.

31:19.666 --> 31:21.750
Then we can have
all the Boston Wild Wings

31:21.833 --> 31:23.041
that we've ever dreamed of,

31:23.125 --> 31:25.750
just like our forefathers
prophesized, okay?

31:25.833 --> 31:27.791
Now, Geronimo, what do you got?

31:27.875 --> 31:30.708
Uh, tracking isn't an exact science.

31:30.791 --> 31:33.458
This is a handkerchief.
What do you think I am? A dog?

31:33.541 --> 31:36.750
[chuckles] Okay,
I know this is a trick question,

31:36.833 --> 31:40.083
so I'm gonna go
with my immediate impulse. Yes.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.583
Fuck you, dude. [sniffs]

31:41.666 --> 31:43.750
-Yeah, he's in there.
-[redcoat 1] Ello, guv'ner.

31:43.833 --> 31:46.208
-[redcoat 2] Ello, guv'ner.
-Ello, guv!

31:46.291 --> 31:48.166
[all] Ello, guv'ner.

31:48.250 --> 31:49.833
All right, that's a lot of men.

31:49.916 --> 31:52.166
And it's a sure bet
that there's even more inside.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.916
Wait, are we seriously
thinkin' about goin' in there?

31:55.000 --> 31:58.125
-Look at this place! It's a quagmire!
-[all] Guv'ner!

31:58.208 --> 32:00.958
Guys, we could be here for years
and accomplish nothing.

32:01.041 --> 32:04.125
You're right.
But we'd be accomplishing nothing…

32:04.750 --> 32:05.916
for America.

32:06.541 --> 32:08.458
Guys, I can't ask you
to go in there with me.

32:08.541 --> 32:09.375
Phew!

32:09.458 --> 32:11.666
-Yeah, good, because no.
-Great. Good luck.

32:11.750 --> 32:13.250
Whoa, whoa, wait, hold on.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.250
I thought I'd be all like,
"No, don't. I can do it."

32:16.333 --> 32:19.708
And then you guys would be like,
"No, I'll come, don't worry."

32:19.791 --> 32:23.291
I never know the right thing to say
when I'm tryin' to lead. This sucks!

32:23.375 --> 32:27.708
So, yeah, I guess I am.
I'm asking you to go in there with me.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.041
Will you please go in there with me?

32:31.625 --> 32:34.333
Huh, well, with a pep talk like that,
how could I say no?

32:34.416 --> 32:37.875
Pfft, whatever.
Let's just go kick some Redcoat ass!

32:37.958 --> 32:41.125
Wait, wait, wait! At least…
Just let me do an entrance thing.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.250
[redcoat] Guv'ner? [grunts]

32:43.333 --> 32:46.291
Ding dong! It's America, motherfucker!

32:46.375 --> 32:48.875
Oh, Georgie! Well, color me surprised.

32:48.958 --> 32:51.000
Oh, I'll color you fuckin' dead, Ben!

32:51.083 --> 32:52.875
[laughs] Bravo!

32:52.958 --> 32:55.833
Did you practice that line
in the car on your way here?

32:55.916 --> 32:57.250
What the fuck is a car?

32:57.333 --> 33:00.333
And, no, it was a rebuttal
to something that you just said!

33:00.416 --> 33:02.041
How could I have thought of it in advance

33:02.125 --> 33:04.750
if you said it just now
and I came up with the perfect rebuttal?

33:04.833 --> 33:06.416
Oh, pardon me.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.458
I forgot you aren't versed
in the gentlemanly art of debate,

33:09.541 --> 33:11.250
like your best friend, Abe Lincoln.

33:11.333 --> 33:15.916
Oh, or should I say ex-best friend?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.125
[laughs]

33:17.208 --> 33:18.875
-Because he's dead.
-Damn, he's good.

33:18.958 --> 33:20.583
-All right, fuck this.
-[glass shatters]

33:22.875 --> 33:26.416
-[motor revs]
-[yelling] For Abe!

33:26.500 --> 33:27.958
[objects clattering]

33:28.041 --> 33:30.833
-[Samuel] Yippie-kay-yay, motherfu-- Whoa!
-[electrical buzzing]

33:30.916 --> 33:33.166
-[Samuel] Watch it, witch!
-[Edison] You watch it, dick!

33:36.291 --> 33:38.333
[George] Yeah.
Well, that could've gone better.

33:38.416 --> 33:41.291
Ya think?
Edison almost got everybody killed!

33:41.375 --> 33:44.333
-Everybody almost got everybody killed!
-Where's Arnold?

33:44.416 --> 33:47.500
And where's Geronimo?
He smells like campfire.

33:52.541 --> 33:54.583
You carry an unusual scent for a man.

33:55.125 --> 33:57.083
Almost like you're
not a man at all, but a--

33:57.166 --> 33:58.208
[growls]

33:58.291 --> 33:59.375
[grunts]

33:59.458 --> 34:01.166
Stay and fight, you dick!

34:01.250 --> 34:03.166
Damn it! Oh, my God! Geronimo!

34:03.250 --> 34:04.541
That bastard bit me!

34:04.625 --> 34:06.916
It can't be.
I thought they were just a myth.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.333
The Navajo have
a name for their kind. Skinwalker.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.125
I won't live with this curse.

34:12.208 --> 34:14.041
-Hand me my ax.
-Are you sure?

34:14.125 --> 34:15.666
Does my grandfather shit in the woods?

34:15.750 --> 34:18.375
Um, I… Does he? I didn't know him.

34:18.458 --> 34:20.125
It's what we call bears.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
We call bears "grandfather."

34:23.083 --> 34:25.125
Fuck it, just give me my ax!

34:25.208 --> 34:26.500
[breathing heavily]

34:28.166 --> 34:29.333
[screams]

34:31.500 --> 34:33.916
Whoa, whoa, Geronimo!
What happened? Are you okay?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.333
Go! I'll take care of him.

34:35.416 --> 34:38.208
She's right, he's not important.
Arnold's getting away!

34:38.291 --> 34:39.541
[horse neighs]

34:39.625 --> 34:42.625
No! No. We never leave a man behind.

34:42.708 --> 34:45.500
Edison, dress that wound.
Paul, call your horse.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.666
Hey, Clyde!

34:47.750 --> 34:49.708
["Yankee And The Brave" playing]

34:52.083 --> 34:54.375
-That way!
-Run, Clyde, run!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.666
[explodes]

35:05.833 --> 35:07.041
[neighs]

35:10.583 --> 35:12.291
[sirens blaring]

35:31.041 --> 35:32.375
[explodes]

35:39.875 --> 35:41.083
[cackles]

35:47.541 --> 35:49.750
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-[hooves screeching]

35:58.416 --> 35:59.333
[neighs]

36:00.041 --> 36:03.166
Welcome to hell… acopter?

36:03.250 --> 36:06.291
I'm still working on it.
I don't love it, but I don't hate it.

36:09.833 --> 36:13.541
-[Edison] Paul, you were amazing.
-[Paul] Aw, thank you, human lady friend.

36:13.625 --> 36:16.875
And, Sam, your propensity
for murder is extraordinary.

36:16.958 --> 36:20.375
Thank you.
I took murder lessons from John Wick.

36:20.458 --> 36:22.458
-[gasps] The candle maker?
-Yeah!

36:22.541 --> 36:25.875
That dude is a fuckin' psycho! [laughs]

36:25.958 --> 36:27.583
Yo, check it. The carriage stopped.

36:27.666 --> 36:29.416
[George] But why would he stop here?

36:29.500 --> 36:30.833
The road to Delaware!

36:33.333 --> 36:35.583
Sea-Doo, bitches!

36:36.625 --> 36:39.416
Paul, can your sizable steed
clear that river?

36:39.500 --> 36:42.208
-Only one way to find out.
-[neighs]

36:43.791 --> 36:45.416
In God I trust.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.500
[neighs]

36:49.041 --> 36:51.416
[all] Whoa!

36:51.500 --> 36:52.625
[Samuel] Oh, shit.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.000
[all coughing]

36:55.083 --> 36:57.833
He shorted it, Paul.
Hey, Paul, he shorted it.

36:57.916 --> 37:01.083
Clyde! His natural buoyancy
can support us all!

37:01.166 --> 37:03.083
[George coughing] Jesus Christ!

37:03.166 --> 37:06.041
Did you know that your horse
could swim that fast?

37:06.125 --> 37:08.500
Oh, yeah, Clyde's a great swimmer.

37:08.583 --> 37:12.166
He's great at so many things.
So proud!

37:13.625 --> 37:14.625
[gasps]

37:15.958 --> 37:19.208
Thank you, Geronimo.
Your hair looks even better wet.

37:19.291 --> 37:21.625
Y'all a bunch of idiots.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.166
[sighs] This feels like the end…

37:24.250 --> 37:26.750
of the first act… of my life.

37:27.416 --> 37:28.791
All hope is lost.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.791
What do we even do now?
Where do we go from here?

37:32.875 --> 37:35.041
[gasps] Where we go isn't the question.

37:35.125 --> 37:37.208
The question is,

37:37.291 --> 37:40.500
do we bring an entree
or a fucking dessert?

37:43.125 --> 37:47.000
[Edison] Oh, guys,
Gettysburg is impossibly vast.

37:47.083 --> 37:50.541
Finding this address
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.375
Yeah, Edison's right. Let's just give up.

37:52.458 --> 37:55.666
-That is not what I said.
-What? Dudes, look, we tried.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.916
One thing. We literally tried one thing.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.958
Yeah, and it didn't work.

38:01.041 --> 38:03.041
-[horn sounds]
-We all got wet, Edison. God!

38:03.125 --> 38:04.666
Look, this isn't fun anymore.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.958
Uh, I can fix that.

38:07.041 --> 38:09.083
Let's get hammered!

38:09.166 --> 38:13.500
Then, fuck it,
we hit the streets mob-rules style.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.458
Anyone we see who doesn't look like us,

38:16.541 --> 38:19.583
they see the bottom of our boots!

38:19.666 --> 38:20.916
Oh, my God.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.041
Okay, fine, no Indians this time.
Ooh, geez.

38:24.125 --> 38:27.333
Oh, my God. I don't know
how many times I have to tell you, Sam.

38:27.416 --> 38:30.500
-This is not India.
-Also, you're a fucking racist.

38:30.583 --> 38:33.166
Uh, no, Paul's the racist.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.416
He's the best horse racist
in the colonies.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.333
Yeah, I'm a great racist.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.791
Holy shit.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.666
-[plucking guitar string]
-[sighs]

38:40.750 --> 38:44.333
[singing] A… A… A… A… A…

38:44.416 --> 38:47.291
Who wants pizza rolls and purple stuff?

38:47.375 --> 38:51.000
-Oh, wow, Chief Geronimo!
-Just Geronimo is fine.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.500
-You're the famous renegade tracker.
-Sure.

38:53.583 --> 38:57.166
And [gasps] you're Thomas Edison,
the world-renowned scientist!

38:57.250 --> 38:58.541
[scoffs] The same.

38:58.625 --> 39:01.250
Wow, George, the team
is really shaping up nicely.

39:01.333 --> 39:04.208
Oh, no. No, we're not
a team anymore, Martha. We quit.

39:04.291 --> 39:06.458
-What?
-Besides, the revolution was Abe's thing.

39:06.541 --> 39:08.666
I tried to avenge him, but we blew it.

39:08.750 --> 39:11.208
Now, we're just gonna jam a bit
and slam some beers.

39:11.291 --> 39:12.875
This is a basic blues riff, guys.

39:12.958 --> 39:16.208
Just watch me for the changes.
All right, losers, let's party.

39:16.291 --> 39:20.333
No! George Bon Jovi Washington,
you do not get to party.

39:20.416 --> 39:22.833
-What?
-Would Abe want to party right now?

39:22.916 --> 39:24.375
Abe never wanted to party.

39:24.458 --> 39:28.583
Because he had goals, unrealized dreams.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.791
But you bet your ass
once those dreams were realized,

39:31.875 --> 39:34.791
he would've snorted a line
as long as the Magna Carta.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.375
Really? No. Abe? My Abe?

39:37.458 --> 39:39.208
Are you kidding? With that head?

39:39.291 --> 39:44.208
[laughs] Dude was all sinus.
He was made for the marching powder.

39:44.291 --> 39:45.500
Not how cocaine works.

39:45.583 --> 39:48.708
Now, those goals are your goals.

39:48.791 --> 39:52.666
Those unrealized dreams
are your unrealized dreams.

39:52.750 --> 39:55.125
That's the promise that you made, right?

39:55.208 --> 39:57.541
So, achieve those goals.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.458
Realize those dreams.

39:59.541 --> 40:03.333
And then, you can party
like a rich white man

40:03.416 --> 40:08.291
who will never face adversity
for the rest of his glorious life!

40:08.958 --> 40:11.416
You're right. I have to earn it.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.625
That is what Abe would want,

40:13.708 --> 40:16.291
that insane coke-hound! [chuckles]

40:16.375 --> 40:18.041
Guys, I've thought about it.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.166
I'm willing to give it another shot
if you are.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.541
-What do you say?
-Sure, man.

40:21.625 --> 40:22.750
Um, you're the one who quit.

40:22.833 --> 40:26.458
If we can find Arnold, we can force
the Gettysburg Address out of him.

40:26.541 --> 40:29.750
Oh, I'm sorry,
did none of you notice my fucking arm?

40:29.833 --> 40:32.000
Benedict Arnold is a werewolf!

40:32.625 --> 40:34.416
In some cultures, known as a skinwalker.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.833
He ain't givin' up shit unless
he thinks we're an actual threat to him.

40:37.916 --> 40:39.666
The only way to be
an actual threat to him--

40:39.750 --> 40:42.041
Is if we have a silver bullet.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.333
-Exactly.
-Wait, what are we doing again?

40:44.416 --> 40:47.125
A silver bullet?
Who could ever even make such a thing?

40:47.208 --> 40:48.458
I know a blacksmith.

40:48.541 --> 40:51.458
He made this armor
and I've never taken it off.

40:51.541 --> 40:54.291
Okay. Okay! We'll visit this blacksmith

40:54.375 --> 40:58.208
and he will discover the secret
of the impossible weapon we require.

40:58.291 --> 41:00.083
Because our cause is just!

41:00.166 --> 41:01.416
It is righteous!

41:01.500 --> 41:03.916
It is His will! His and Abe's!

41:04.000 --> 41:05.583
-And the Earth Mother's.
-Nope.

41:05.666 --> 41:07.625
-And Isaac Newton's.
-Nope. Just God's.

41:07.708 --> 41:10.041
I hold these truths to be self-evident.

41:10.125 --> 41:12.208
All for one and one for all!

41:12.291 --> 41:14.500
We will find the Gettysburg Address.

41:14.583 --> 41:15.708
[all] Huzzah!

41:15.791 --> 41:17.708
[Paul] Huzzah! Nope, too late.

41:19.833 --> 41:21.166
[clanking]

41:21.875 --> 41:22.708
[grunts]

41:22.791 --> 41:24.166
[hisses]

41:32.083 --> 41:35.041
-Smittay!
-[bell chimes]

41:37.083 --> 41:39.166
Damn! Fuck my life.

41:39.250 --> 41:40.708
We're friends.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.833
[birds chirping]

41:43.875 --> 41:46.166
Do I even wanna know
why you need a silver bullet?

41:46.250 --> 41:48.041
Best that you not know, Mr. Smith.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.666
Why do you keep calling me Mr. Smith?

41:49.750 --> 41:52.041
Well, Revere called you Black Smith.

41:52.125 --> 41:55.125
-Right, because I'm a blacksmith.
-Right. A Black Smith.

41:55.208 --> 41:56.750
-A blacksmith.
-Black Smith.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.750
I'm a smith who works with metal,

41:58.833 --> 42:02.833
which oxidizes during
the heating process and turns black.

42:02.916 --> 42:05.500
-So, you're a Smith.
-Exactly.

42:05.583 --> 42:07.083
-Of the Baltimore Smiths?
-[sighs]

42:07.166 --> 42:08.750
Just tell me what you need it for.

42:08.833 --> 42:11.500
It'll be used to free the colonies.
Let's just leave it at that.

42:11.583 --> 42:14.250
Oh, you're talking about the Brits.

42:14.333 --> 42:17.416
Shit, why didn't you say so?
I'm definitely down for that.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.208
-You are?
-Fuck, yeah!

42:19.291 --> 42:20.833
I mean, don't get it twisted.

42:20.916 --> 42:23.291
I definitely do not trust
you motherfuckers.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.125
You three, especially.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.375
But fuck, man, I hate the British.

42:27.458 --> 42:29.250
Why, what have the fun police done to you?

42:29.333 --> 42:31.416
Look around. I'm a small business owner.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.208
What's a small business owner's
greatest enemy?

42:34.291 --> 42:36.041
-Large businesses?
-Thin profit margins?

42:36.125 --> 42:38.708
-Rising lube costs?
-White people stealing everything you own.

42:38.958 --> 42:40.666
-Having a squirrel for a friend?
-No.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.458
-Staff turnover?
-Tesla being a bitch?

42:42.541 --> 42:46.125
-Not getting drunk at lunch?
-White people stealing everything you own.

42:46.208 --> 42:47.708
Constant instinct to second-guess

42:47.791 --> 42:50.250
having risked your savings
on unproven business acumen?

42:50.333 --> 42:53.041
-No, it's taxes.
-Taxes. Correct.

42:53.125 --> 42:56.791
Small business taxes. And what's
the big knock against the British?

42:56.875 --> 42:59.125
-Something about taxation!
-Exactly.

42:59.208 --> 43:01.875
You'll help us? You'll craft
the silver bullet free of charge?

43:01.958 --> 43:04.250
What? Are you white motherfuckers crazy?

43:04.333 --> 43:07.000
I just told you
I'm a small business owner.

43:07.083 --> 43:09.625
You think I'm gonna
give you silver for free?

43:09.708 --> 43:11.291
Well, we don't have silver.

43:11.375 --> 43:13.333
The British seized it all
when they got here--

43:13.416 --> 43:16.625
Spoons. Teaspoons. I remember.

43:16.708 --> 43:18.750
Why do you think that shit's so expensive?

43:18.833 --> 43:21.875
Okay. Well, how much
do we need for, like, one bullet?

43:21.958 --> 43:24.333
-A metric shit-ton.
-For one bullet?

43:24.416 --> 43:28.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you a fucking metallurgist like me?

43:28.083 --> 43:30.458
-That's, like, a thousand spoons!
-Three thousand.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.500
It's a metric shit-ton.

43:32.583 --> 43:35.541
Where are we gonna get
3,000 spoons overnight, bro?

43:35.625 --> 43:36.458
Well…

43:36.541 --> 43:39.166
[ship horn sounds]

43:39.250 --> 43:42.083
[blacksmith] May I present,
the year's biggest tea party.

43:42.166 --> 43:45.041
You need silver spoons,
you need to get aboard that ship.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.458
Wait a minute.
How did you know about this?

43:48.500 --> 43:50.916
[Samuel] What's up with
these assholes and flyers?

43:51.000 --> 43:54.458
Well, it's a great way to communicate
with a widespread audience,

43:54.541 --> 43:58.208
much like direct mail or the Pony Express,
where my brother does not work.

43:58.291 --> 44:01.625
-[grunts] All right. Shall we?
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait!

44:04.166 --> 44:05.625
-We need a plan.
-Why?

44:05.708 --> 44:08.583
Well, last time we didn't have one
and things got shitty.

44:08.666 --> 44:10.333
-Huh?
-Yeah, Geronimo lost his arm.

44:10.416 --> 44:13.916
-No, he lost like three-fifths of an arm.
-[scoffs] Seriously?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.958
Oh, thoughts and prayers.

44:16.041 --> 44:19.250
Look, good leaders like Abe
have a plan for everything.

44:19.333 --> 44:21.875
-All right, His Leadership, let's hear it.
-Okay.

44:21.958 --> 44:24.583
So, Mr. Smith, you'll be the lookout.

44:24.666 --> 44:26.791
-[blacksmith laughs] Nope.
-What?

44:26.875 --> 44:31.083
You want me, a Black dude,
to sit here in the dark, alone,

44:31.166 --> 44:33.458
to play lookout for you
while you break the law?

44:33.541 --> 44:37.500
Oh, hell no! I hate the British
but I ain't lookin' to get killed.

44:37.583 --> 44:40.458
So, y'all are on your own
to get that silver.

44:40.541 --> 44:42.875
But if you do get it,
I'll make your little bullet.

44:42.958 --> 44:45.041
All right. Then…

44:45.125 --> 44:46.375
here's the plan.

44:46.458 --> 44:50.416
Geronimo, you'll be the lookout.
Are you cool with being the lookout?

44:50.500 --> 44:52.958
I mean, if my choice is to be the lookout

44:53.041 --> 44:56.666
or have one of you looking out for me,
yeah, I'll be the lookout.

44:56.750 --> 45:00.708
Great. Okay. Edison, you'll pose as
the wife of an officer already on board.

45:00.791 --> 45:04.833
[groans] This is taking too long.
Let's just dress as those guys.

45:04.916 --> 45:07.375
[all] Ello, guv.

45:07.458 --> 45:09.833
Well, technically, that is a plan.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.000
Just technically, a very bad plan.

45:14.083 --> 45:18.916
Ha! I told you a jail would be
a better use of space than lifeboats.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.208
Hey, at least we got on board,
right, guys?

45:21.291 --> 45:24.250
I consider this mission accomplished.
Ooh, we should get a banner.

45:24.333 --> 45:28.375
Ugh, shockingly, Sam's not wrong.
We can still make this work.

45:28.458 --> 45:30.666
I've taken note
of how often the guards go on rounds.

45:30.750 --> 45:32.666
-If we lay low for a few hours--
-No!

45:32.750 --> 45:34.875
Enough with all of the planning!

45:34.958 --> 45:38.125
Did Magellan have a plan
when he circumnavigated the globe?

45:38.208 --> 45:39.333
-[all] No!
-[Edison] Yes.

45:39.416 --> 45:40.750
That took a lot of preparation.

45:40.833 --> 45:46.000
We'll set our course for freedom
using only our wits as our guide.

45:46.083 --> 45:48.916
Mr. Revere, tear down that wall.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.458
[Paul] Whee!

45:53.958 --> 45:55.333
What is this place?

45:55.416 --> 45:57.666
I don't know, but don't touch any--

45:57.750 --> 45:58.958
Ooh, oops.

46:10.750 --> 46:14.416
They're steeping the colonists in tea!

46:14.500 --> 46:18.041
Turning them British.
James, you sick bastard!

46:18.125 --> 46:20.541
Look, as far as I can tell,
this is a test run.

46:20.625 --> 46:23.375
James is up to something bigger
than crushing the revolution.

46:23.458 --> 46:25.916
Maybe even…
Oh, fuck! I don't even want to say it!

46:26.000 --> 46:27.750
-Just say it.
-Something global.

46:27.833 --> 46:28.708
[all gasp]

46:28.791 --> 46:31.750
-That means…
-There are global stakes now.

46:31.833 --> 46:34.416
Good God!
Can you figure out what he's planning?

46:34.500 --> 46:37.291
Yeah, I think I can.
If I can just hack the mainframe.

46:37.375 --> 46:40.125
Great. Guys, gather as many
silver spoons as you can.

46:40.208 --> 46:44.291
In the meantime, I'll get these
hardworking Americans out of these tubes!

46:44.375 --> 46:45.625
[Edison] George! No!

46:46.541 --> 46:50.708
No! I had almost downloaded the plan.

46:50.791 --> 46:53.333
-Uh, guys, we gotta go.
-Yep.

46:53.416 --> 46:56.000
Totally right.
Grab spoons, guys. Quick, let's go.

46:57.166 --> 46:58.833
[exploding]

47:01.666 --> 47:03.000
[indistinct shouting]

47:05.416 --> 47:06.750
[screams]

47:09.958 --> 47:12.708
-[Paul] Oh, no.
-Oh, my God, the humanity.

47:12.791 --> 47:15.083
This is bad. This is so bad.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.916
Those poor boat people.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.708
Look, if anybody asks,
the Titanic hit an iceberg.

47:20.791 --> 47:23.250
We were never here, baby.

47:27.333 --> 47:28.666
[sighs]

47:28.750 --> 47:31.791
It's hopeless, Martha.
At this rate, I'll never avenge Abe.

47:31.875 --> 47:33.708
And see his dream through, don't forget.

47:33.791 --> 47:36.458
-That's the whole second part.
-I tried.

47:36.541 --> 47:40.375
I tried to be a leader like him, Martha.
It's just not working.

47:40.458 --> 47:43.666
Oh, George. Abe was a great leader,
but you can't copy him.

47:43.750 --> 47:46.458
You must find
your own style of leadership.

47:46.541 --> 47:50.583
Maybe something with less planning.
Something more free-spirited, like you.

47:50.666 --> 47:53.333
I know. I just wish
I realized that before we…

47:53.416 --> 47:56.458
Before the Titanic hit that iceberg.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.333
Yes. What a tragedy.

47:58.416 --> 48:00.416
Right? Such a tragedy!

48:00.500 --> 48:05.333
It feels like, for every step forward,
we just take two steps back. John 3:16.

48:05.416 --> 48:09.041
Then, let's focus on the positive, huh?
What was tonight's step forward?

48:09.125 --> 48:10.875
-I got these spoons.
-[spoons jingling]

48:10.958 --> 48:14.291
Oh, that's great, George.
And are they, like, for something?

48:14.375 --> 48:17.875
Yeah, but they're still useless
without the Gettysburg Address.

48:17.958 --> 48:21.041
[sighs] The tirelessness
with which you've pursued your quest

48:21.125 --> 48:23.000
has betrayed your confidence in it.

48:23.083 --> 48:25.333
Perhaps a quick HJ to help you sleep.

48:25.416 --> 48:27.583
Generous, but I need to earn it.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.250
Then, for now, rest, my love.

48:29.333 --> 48:32.083
Clear your head.
It's always darkest before the dawn.

48:32.166 --> 48:35.083
-John 3:16?
-I don't think so, champ.

48:35.958 --> 48:38.250
For now, rest, my love. Clear your head.

48:38.333 --> 48:40.250
It's always darkest before the dawn.

48:41.291 --> 48:42.208
[gasps]

48:42.291 --> 48:43.750
Where am I?

48:43.833 --> 48:45.875
[Abe] Don't worry, George. You're safe.

48:45.958 --> 48:49.708
Abe? Abe, is that you?
I can't see. Everything's so bright.

48:49.791 --> 48:53.333
Oh, that's me. Sorry, I was trying
to make this seem more impressive.

48:53.833 --> 48:56.708
It's great to see you, Abe.
But what is this place?

48:56.791 --> 48:59.833
[echoing] It's your dream world, George.

48:59.916 --> 49:00.958
Is it?

49:01.041 --> 49:04.583
Can I ask a question, real quick?
Why is my dream world so shitty?

49:04.666 --> 49:07.041
[chuckles] Well, we ran out of money.

49:07.125 --> 49:08.666
-My dream ran out of money?
-Sure.

49:08.750 --> 49:12.500
Yeah. Look, I've been told by the,
you know, "dream producers,"

49:12.583 --> 49:15.291
that we could use this money
more effectively elsewhere.

49:15.375 --> 49:19.875
Like in an epic ending battle happening
sometime in the next 30 minutes or so.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.583
Okay, well, what were you gonna do?

49:21.666 --> 49:23.708
Oh, I had this whole idea worked out.

49:23.791 --> 49:26.500
-You were gonna fight a dream-hydra.
-Whoa, that's cool.

49:26.583 --> 49:29.875
I know. And it was made up
of all of King James' rules.

49:29.958 --> 49:32.375
And for every rule you cut down,
another appeared.

49:32.458 --> 49:33.708
-Rah!
-[George] Ooh!

49:33.791 --> 49:35.958
-That's a nice metaphor, dude!
-Thanks, bro.

49:36.041 --> 49:37.958
And it was all about how the revolution

49:38.041 --> 49:40.958
is about more
than just breaking the king's rules.

49:41.041 --> 49:43.000
It's also about your son.

49:43.083 --> 49:46.083
-What? I'm havin' a boy?
-[laughs] Yeah!

49:46.166 --> 49:49.208
Boom! Sex, bitch! Oh, shit! Yeah!

49:49.291 --> 49:51.083
Either way would be cool. Girls are cool.

49:51.166 --> 49:54.500
Yeah. Yeah, it's a son, though.
He's the future.

49:54.583 --> 49:57.875
Him and all the sons
and daughters of this great nation,

49:57.958 --> 50:01.041
no matter what they look like
or where they come from.

50:01.125 --> 50:03.250
Be a leader for them, George.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.291
A leader for all people!

50:05.375 --> 50:07.666
I get it. I get it, Abe.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.416
But I would've got it a lot better

50:09.500 --> 50:11.666
if I was kicking an ass
of a giant dream-hydra,

50:11.750 --> 50:13.666
but I'm just saying, I get it. I got it.

50:13.750 --> 50:15.458
Agreed. But don't worry, George.

50:15.541 --> 50:17.333
There's plenty of fighting left to do.

50:17.416 --> 50:18.750
Oh, and one more thing.

50:18.833 --> 50:21.125
What is it, old chum?
You can tell me anything.

50:21.208 --> 50:24.166
When your wife
offers you a hand job, you take it.

50:24.250 --> 50:25.750
-[Martha] George!
-Martha!

50:25.833 --> 50:28.333
-[groans] George!
-Martha!

50:28.416 --> 50:31.000
Oh, don't worry about her, Georgie.

50:31.083 --> 50:35.583
She'll be quite not well taken care of,
if you catch my drift.

50:35.666 --> 50:39.291
I don't. But you were on the Titanic.
You should be dead.

50:39.375 --> 50:41.916
I mean, I heard you were on the Titanic.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.416
That's what I heard
from someone who was there,

50:44.500 --> 50:47.666
while I was here… reading… this book.

50:47.750 --> 50:48.875
The Graps of Wreath.

50:48.958 --> 50:51.250
Yes, well,
I'm an excellent swimmer, dickhead.

50:51.333 --> 50:53.000
You should've done your research.

50:53.083 --> 50:54.166
Thanks for the tip.

50:54.250 --> 50:56.333
When Edison invents
the Internet next year,

50:56.416 --> 50:59.708
I'll make sure
to edit your Wikipedia page myself.

50:59.791 --> 51:05.500
"Benedict Arnold, great swimmer
and a total fucking asswipe."

51:05.583 --> 51:07.458
Well, I'll just change it back.

51:07.541 --> 51:10.083
No, you won't, because you'll be dead!

51:10.166 --> 51:12.000
-[motor sputters]
-Huh?

51:12.125 --> 51:13.041
What?

51:13.125 --> 51:15.458
Well, maybe
after she invents the Internet,

51:15.541 --> 51:20.125
your friend Edison can invent chainsaws
that don't require gasoline. [laughs]

51:20.208 --> 51:25.458
You sucked the gas out
of my arm chainsaws while I was sleeping?

51:25.541 --> 51:28.958
Jesus Christ,
what kind of psychopath are you?

51:29.041 --> 51:31.375
The worst kind.

51:31.875 --> 51:33.208
Whatever you take that to mean.

51:33.291 --> 51:35.208
Take her to the Gettysburg Address.

51:35.291 --> 51:36.958
-[Martha] George, no!
-Martha!

51:37.041 --> 51:40.583
Oh, my, Georgie,
I just realized we woke you up.

51:41.166 --> 51:44.458
-Please allow us to recompense.
-[grunts]

51:46.416 --> 51:49.458
[Paul] Last night was bad news,
human friends.

51:49.541 --> 51:53.750
Yeah, bad news for the fun police.
Eat a dick, Titanic!

51:53.833 --> 51:56.875
-[laughs]
-Right! Yes! Cool, cool, cool.

51:56.958 --> 52:01.125
And I guess the entire harbor ecosystem
can just eat a dick, too, right?

52:01.208 --> 52:04.583
I mean… Yes, 100%.

52:04.666 --> 52:08.958
Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!

52:09.041 --> 52:10.500
-Are you okay?
-George! What is it?

52:10.583 --> 52:12.000
Arnold kidnapped Martha!

52:12.083 --> 52:14.083
-Oh, no!
-It sucks when they steal your wife!

52:14.166 --> 52:15.250
And she's pregnant!

52:15.333 --> 52:17.333
-What?
-Congratulations, that's a beautiful gift!

52:17.416 --> 52:19.791
Thanks! I'm sorry
this is how I'm telling you,

52:19.875 --> 52:21.458
but we appreciate your support!

52:21.541 --> 52:23.458
We're already
on waiting lists for preschool.

52:23.541 --> 52:26.875
Hey, man. Maybe you need
to take some time for yourself.

52:26.958 --> 52:28.916
It's a lot, emotionally. I would know.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.583
No, that's exactly what I don't need.

52:31.666 --> 52:34.375
The old George
would just party these woes away.

52:34.458 --> 52:37.833
But not me.
This just adds fuel to my fuckin' fire.

52:37.916 --> 52:39.291
Hell yeah, man!

52:39.375 --> 52:41.541
Ben said he's keeping her
at the Gettysburg Address.

52:41.625 --> 52:44.791
Which we still don't have.
George, I'm sorry to say,

52:44.875 --> 52:46.958
but we've tried
everything to crack this code.

52:47.041 --> 52:49.208
-Code…
-I don't know what else we can do.

52:50.208 --> 52:52.958
-Code… Oh! Holy shit!
-What?

52:53.041 --> 52:54.416
[George] Not many people know this,

52:54.500 --> 52:57.666
but Abe wasn't
just America's premier celebrity chef.

52:57.750 --> 53:00.250
He was also
its most capable cryptographer.

53:00.333 --> 53:01.458
Plip-plopipher?

53:01.541 --> 53:05.250
Cryptographer. You know, someone
who crafts and solves codes and ciphers.

53:05.333 --> 53:06.875
[chuckling] Yeah, a plip-plopipher.

53:06.958 --> 53:09.958
That's what I said.
We're saying the same thing.

53:10.041 --> 53:13.125
Exactly. Which means
that Abe's final edict,

53:13.208 --> 53:18.291
that I name our freed country America,
was itself likely a cipher.

53:18.375 --> 53:21.791
Hidden within the words
of America, my friends,

53:21.875 --> 53:24.500
is the Gettysburg Address.

53:24.583 --> 53:26.625
I don't know, seems like kind of a leap.

53:26.708 --> 53:28.875
But I'll need some time to crack the code.

53:28.958 --> 53:31.583
In the meantime, someone must
run the spoons to Black Smith.

53:31.666 --> 53:33.375
[all at once] Not it!

53:33.458 --> 53:36.500
-All right, Chief, that's you.
-What the fuck just happened?

53:36.583 --> 53:39.833
Did I just lose a game that
white people didn't explain the rules to?

53:39.916 --> 53:41.666
I can't carry all the silver.

53:41.750 --> 53:44.958
-I only got the one arm.
-[laughing] And whose fault is that?

53:45.041 --> 53:47.625
That would be yours.
For screwing up Vietnam.

53:47.708 --> 53:51.250
What are you talking about?
We won Vietnam.

53:51.333 --> 53:55.958
[sighs] Actually, if it gives me some time
away from you, yeah, I'll do it.

53:56.041 --> 53:59.666
-You are a good man, Chief Geronimo.
-[Geronimo] Just Geronimo.

53:59.750 --> 54:01.125
The rest of you, come with me.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.916
I know the perfect place
to work on Abe's cipher.

54:08.583 --> 54:10.333
Ugh, come on.

54:15.166 --> 54:17.083
[King James] You left Washington alive.

54:17.166 --> 54:20.458
[Benedict] Uh, yes,
a calculated risk, my liege.

54:20.541 --> 54:22.291
Instead of trimming one thorn,

54:22.375 --> 54:25.916
we may soon be in position
to wipe out the whole damn bush.

54:27.666 --> 54:29.666
[King James] And kidnapping his wife?

54:29.750 --> 54:32.250
You're not worried that will motivate him?

54:32.333 --> 54:34.375
Oh, I'm counting on it.

54:34.458 --> 54:38.250
Still, we should expedite my… Your plan.

54:38.333 --> 54:41.500
Very well. Send me the head engineer.

54:43.708 --> 54:45.458
You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?

54:45.541 --> 54:48.250
There's been a slight change of plan.

54:48.333 --> 54:51.791
We'll need my weapon operational
sooner than anticipated.

54:51.875 --> 54:53.500
How much sooner, Your Majesty?

54:53.583 --> 54:55.166
You tell me.

54:55.250 --> 54:56.916
If we work around the clock,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.041
we could probably
have it ready in three weeks?

55:02.625 --> 55:05.416
-[gulps]
-[whistle blows]

55:05.500 --> 55:08.958
Please, Your Majesty, Your Highness.
I can do it faster.

55:12.166 --> 55:14.291
Ah, thank God.

55:16.166 --> 55:18.625
-[gasps]
-[shrieks]

55:19.958 --> 55:21.125
My foot!

55:21.208 --> 55:22.625
Most impressive.

55:22.708 --> 55:24.916
[screams]

55:25.000 --> 55:27.666
Manchester, come to Daddy.

55:27.750 --> 55:29.541
Oh, look at the good boy.

55:29.666 --> 55:32.416
Oh, look, you have
a little engineer on your face.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.250
Well, I guess I do, too, now.

55:34.333 --> 55:37.291
Don't I? Don't I? Yes!

55:37.375 --> 55:39.208
-[kisses]
-Uh, okay.

55:39.291 --> 55:42.083
I'll have Engineering
redouble their efforts.

55:42.166 --> 55:44.125
See that you do, Arnold.

55:44.208 --> 55:46.541
Whether or not you succeed with your plan,

55:46.625 --> 55:48.875
and in case it wasn't clear,
I'm not holding my breath,

55:48.958 --> 55:51.041
Washington is now marching inexorably

55:51.125 --> 55:54.083
into the gnashing maw
of the most diabolical war machine

55:54.166 --> 55:55.666
the world has ever known.

55:55.750 --> 55:58.458
And he doesn't even see it coming.

55:58.541 --> 56:02.125
-[laughs maniacally]
-Yes. They never do.

56:04.166 --> 56:08.208
Uh, George? I thought you said
you had a safe place to work.

56:08.291 --> 56:10.833
-What? This looks good to me.
-Thank you, Paul.

56:10.916 --> 56:14.291
But this isn't the place I had in mind.
That is.

56:14.375 --> 56:16.541
-[all exclaim]
-[Paul] It got even better!

56:18.583 --> 56:20.625
[George] Abe, I'm home.

56:21.416 --> 56:24.291
-[hisses]
-[exclaims] Pardon me, ma'am.

56:27.958 --> 56:31.375
Oh, my gord, horse toys! Whee!

56:41.250 --> 56:42.541
George?

56:42.625 --> 56:44.416
-George, are you okay, buddy?
-[sniffles]

56:44.500 --> 56:45.833
Yes, I am.

56:45.916 --> 56:48.666
But I need to be one with Abe now.

56:48.750 --> 56:52.541
I have to get inside of his head
if I hope to crack this code.

56:53.833 --> 56:55.000
Okay.

56:56.958 --> 56:57.875
Come on, come on!

56:59.625 --> 57:01.166
Confirm! Please confirm!

57:01.750 --> 57:03.000
We are cruisin'!

57:03.833 --> 57:05.625
Oh, yeah! [chuckles]

57:08.125 --> 57:10.750
Next and next. Next. Too easy.

57:10.833 --> 57:14.333
No, no, don't. No, no. Yes!
Reset 30%, please!

57:14.416 --> 57:16.000
Fuck no! I'm fucked.

57:16.333 --> 57:17.208
No, fuck!

57:19.083 --> 57:21.375
I am rusty, rusty.

57:21.458 --> 57:24.333
Okay, at the hands of this guy is you.

57:25.125 --> 57:26.250
Eternal destruction.

57:27.541 --> 57:29.041
Quick, quick, quick! Thank you.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.958
Return. Return. Yes!

57:31.041 --> 57:33.208
Three, two, one. Go!

57:33.291 --> 57:34.500
Come on. Yeah!

57:35.291 --> 57:37.000
Whoo! Yeah!

57:37.083 --> 57:38.458
You've been hacked, bro!

57:42.083 --> 57:45.000
So, what are you going to do
when this is all over, huh?

57:45.083 --> 57:46.458
You got family somewhere?

57:46.541 --> 57:47.750
Clyde is my family.

57:47.833 --> 57:51.416
No, I know, but like,
you know, people family, friends?

57:51.500 --> 57:53.000
That's why I'm doing this.

57:53.083 --> 57:57.541
You started a war against the most
powerful country on Earth to make friends?

57:57.625 --> 58:00.541
Yes. Yes, I did.
I never had people friends.

58:00.625 --> 58:02.541
Oh, Paul. You have one now.

58:02.625 --> 58:04.666
Thank you. Why do you wanna make war?

58:04.750 --> 58:07.916
They're mean to you
and they disrespect you, like a mule.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.916
Well, George means well.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.083
Sam disrespects me, but he's an idiot.

58:12.166 --> 58:15.666
Listen, lions don't concern themselves
with the opinions of sheep.

58:15.750 --> 58:20.000
Well, I'm friends with a lot of sheep
and, boy, are they opinionated.

58:20.083 --> 58:22.500
-Oh, I just meant--
-[mimics sheep bleating]

58:22.583 --> 58:23.625
That's how sheep talk.

58:23.708 --> 58:27.125
Look, I'm doing this
because I want science for everyone.

58:27.208 --> 58:30.791
Without fear of punishment
or persecution or even judgment.

58:30.875 --> 58:33.375
Problem is,
the rich white assholes that run the joint

58:33.458 --> 58:36.000
keep telling everyone
that science isn't real.

58:36.083 --> 58:38.375
So, I'm gonna show 'em.

58:38.458 --> 58:41.708
I'm gonna show the whole
damn world that science is real.

58:41.791 --> 58:43.208
How are you gonna do that?

58:43.291 --> 58:45.666
By using it to do something
that no one can ignore.

58:45.750 --> 58:50.083
-I'm going to use science to win a war.
-Oh!

58:50.166 --> 58:51.750
I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet.

58:51.833 --> 58:56.125
But all it takes is one great invention
deployed at the perfect time,

58:56.208 --> 58:59.083
and then,
the whole world will yell at once--

58:59.166 --> 59:01.958
-[door slams open]
-Eur-goddamn-reka!

59:02.500 --> 59:05.916
…at which point, I was reminded
of one of Abe's favorite exploits.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.958
After a reverse hash,
I backdoored the root password.

59:09.041 --> 59:11.250
A base checksum
against the main data store

59:11.333 --> 59:13.208
allowed me to retrieve the salted hash,

59:13.291 --> 59:16.291
and then, from there,
I was gleaming the cube.

59:16.375 --> 59:18.125
George, this is amazing!

59:18.208 --> 59:19.666
You haven't even heard the kicker.

59:19.750 --> 59:22.458
When I extrapolated through
a dual node minimum spanning tree,

59:22.541 --> 59:25.125
the cipher's definition revealed itself.

59:25.208 --> 59:27.791
"A" is the first letter of the alphabet,

59:27.875 --> 59:31.541
which means it is letter number one.

59:31.625 --> 59:33.791
Therefore, "A" equals one.

59:33.875 --> 59:36.125
-Yeah, I understand all of this.
-Oh!

59:36.208 --> 59:38.958
And if "A" equals one, then--

59:39.041 --> 59:41.375
-You've got to be kidding me!
-Both of us.

59:41.458 --> 59:45.083
I am not. America equals "1 Merica."

59:45.166 --> 59:48.125
Now, does that word "Merica"
ring a bell to any of you?

59:48.208 --> 59:50.500
Oh! Oh! I know! Fuck, I lost it.

59:50.583 --> 59:52.208
Ooh, no. Does it start with a one?

59:52.291 --> 59:54.000
Maybe this will jog your memory.

59:54.083 --> 59:57.083
This is ten times magnification.

59:57.166 --> 59:59.083
Oh, my God.

59:59.166 --> 1:00:04.208
[George] Gentlemen, lady,
I give you the Gettysburg Address.

1:00:04.791 --> 1:00:05.666
[Samuel] Oof!

1:00:05.750 --> 1:00:10.333
Oh. I guess we… I guess we
should've scouted the area, right, guys?

1:00:10.416 --> 1:00:14.041
But then we wouldn't have had George's
awesome code-cracking scene, right?

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:16.083
Really? You thought that was awesome?

1:00:16.166 --> 1:00:18.250
It wasn't, you know, too indulgent?

1:00:18.333 --> 1:00:21.083
No way, dude. Totally realistic.

1:00:21.166 --> 1:00:22.541
And entirely too short.

1:00:22.625 --> 1:00:25.375
Guys, you have got to see this. Look.

1:00:25.458 --> 1:00:26.750
Whoa!

1:00:26.833 --> 1:00:27.875
[Samuel] What do you see?

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:30.208
[George] Redcoats standing around a table.

1:00:30.291 --> 1:00:33.583
And there's only one reason
grown men would stand around a table.

1:00:33.666 --> 1:00:35.208
-To jerk off.
-To plot-- What?

1:00:35.291 --> 1:00:39.041
-To plot.
-Exactly. The meeting's already underway.

1:00:39.125 --> 1:00:40.833
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

1:00:40.916 --> 1:00:43.958
George, wait.
We don't have the silver bullet yet.

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:46.458
-We need it to kill Arnold.
-Damn it! That's right.

1:00:46.541 --> 1:00:48.708
Where the hell are those guys
with our silver bullet?

1:00:50.625 --> 1:00:52.958
[hip-hop music playing]

1:00:54.250 --> 1:00:56.958
...and then the big dumb one says,
"We won Vietnam."

1:00:57.041 --> 1:00:58.625
[laughs]

1:00:58.708 --> 1:01:04.916
Can you imagine being so used to winning
at everything for your whole life,

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.166
that even when you lose,
your brain's just like,

1:01:07.250 --> 1:01:10.541
"Yo, we must've won that shit, right?"

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:13.083
That's the definition of privilege,
right there.

1:01:13.166 --> 1:01:16.666
Oh, I've tried to
tell them that so many times,

1:01:16.750 --> 1:01:18.583
but they don't even hear me.

1:01:18.666 --> 1:01:20.250
You wanna get through to them,

1:01:20.333 --> 1:01:23.166
you'd have to put
your message in like, I don't know,

1:01:23.250 --> 1:01:26.583
the dumbest thing possible,
like a cartoon or something.

1:01:27.833 --> 1:01:30.708
Hey, so how much longer
on this silver bullet?

1:01:30.791 --> 1:01:33.041
-Man, that shit been done for hours.
-What?

1:01:33.125 --> 1:01:34.583
[both laugh]

1:01:36.250 --> 1:01:37.375
Oh, yeah.

1:01:38.083 --> 1:01:39.750
I can't wait any longer.

1:01:39.833 --> 1:01:42.000
I have to rescue my wife and unborn child.

1:01:42.083 --> 1:01:44.041
If that baby-eating bastard is in there--

1:01:44.125 --> 1:01:47.041
Oh, my God! He threatened
to eat your unborn baby?

1:01:47.125 --> 1:01:50.666
No, no, no. I mean, not literally.
But, look, he's very evil, Edison.

1:01:50.750 --> 1:01:52.958
I mean, come on.
Are we splittin' hairs here?

1:01:53.041 --> 1:01:55.458
George, without that silver bullet,
we'll all be dinner.

1:01:55.541 --> 1:01:59.416
I know, okay? Look, guys,
I don't expect you to go in there.

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:01.583
It's suicide, but I have to.

1:02:01.666 --> 1:02:03.625
George, we're a team.

1:02:03.708 --> 1:02:06.125
If there's even a chance
we can save your family,

1:02:06.208 --> 1:02:07.833
we have to take it. Right, guys?

1:02:07.916 --> 1:02:11.333
-Plus, I just heard he eats babies!
-Oh, no!

1:02:11.416 --> 1:02:13.166
-Sam, no!
-I knew it!

1:02:13.250 --> 1:02:16.333
There's no time to lose.
Come on. Let's get our sneak on.

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:31.291
[softly] Science.

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:36.125
Uh-huh. The door's not locked.

1:02:36.208 --> 1:02:39.250
It didn't need to be. Laser beams.

1:02:39.333 --> 1:02:41.541
Hope you boys are limbered up.

1:02:42.125 --> 1:02:46.833
Easy. Easy, does it. Easy, Daddy.
Oh, easy.

1:02:46.916 --> 1:02:48.750
[grunts]

1:02:48.833 --> 1:02:51.916
Uh, guys, this is just yarn.

1:02:53.750 --> 1:02:55.708
I'm creeping very quietly.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:01.125
Don't you move, bad guy!

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:04.333
[laughs]

1:03:04.416 --> 1:03:07.041
Look at him go! That's great!

1:03:11.958 --> 1:03:14.250
Ha-ha! What the shit?

1:03:14.333 --> 1:03:17.750
Who fucking drew this?
This is completely unrealistic.

1:03:17.833 --> 1:03:20.458
-[man 1 over speaker] Pip-Pip, cheerio.
-[man 2] Bob's your uncle.

1:03:20.541 --> 1:03:22.375
-[man 1] Ello, guv!
-[man 3] Bangers and mash.

1:03:24.958 --> 1:03:26.958
[man 3] Enslave the Irish! [laughs]

1:03:27.666 --> 1:03:29.250
That bastard set us up.

1:03:29.916 --> 1:03:31.250
Martha!

1:03:32.875 --> 1:03:35.083
-Martha!
-George, wait! It's a… trap.

1:03:35.166 --> 1:03:36.458
Yep, shit.

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:40.166
-What did they do to your wife?
-Paul, that's not Martha.

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:42.125
It's a hyper-thermobaric bomb.

1:03:42.208 --> 1:03:45.625
My hand blasters should interrupt
the current to the triggering mechanism.

1:03:45.708 --> 1:03:46.958
[whispers] Science.

1:03:47.041 --> 1:03:49.000
-[beeping]
-Oh, what?

1:03:49.083 --> 1:03:51.125
Witch, that was your one chance

1:03:51.208 --> 1:03:53.958
and your beloved science
totally fucked us!

1:03:54.041 --> 1:03:56.375
I don't understand. I used science.

1:03:56.458 --> 1:03:59.541
We're outta time. I have to
get this as far away as possible.

1:03:59.625 --> 1:04:01.000
It's up to you guys now.

1:04:01.083 --> 1:04:03.666
Save Martha! Save America!

1:04:03.750 --> 1:04:06.041
No, you save her yourself, George.

1:04:06.125 --> 1:04:08.208
This is a job for a racist.

1:04:08.291 --> 1:04:10.958
The fastest racist in the colonies.

1:04:11.583 --> 1:04:12.958
Goodbye, people friends!

1:04:14.791 --> 1:04:15.875
-[neighs]
-Yah!

1:04:15.958 --> 1:04:18.375
Go, Clyde! Fast as the wind!

1:04:22.458 --> 1:04:24.541
Hey, compadre, vamanos!

1:04:24.625 --> 1:04:26.166
Clyde, what are you talking about?

1:04:26.250 --> 1:04:29.458
Clyde can get a lot further away
without Pablo's added weight.

1:04:29.541 --> 1:04:31.458
No! But Clyde is Paul's only friend!

1:04:31.541 --> 1:04:35.333
-No, Pablo has human friends now.
-But, Clyde--

1:04:35.416 --> 1:04:37.833
Go! Git! [neighs]

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:39.750
Don't you see?

1:04:40.333 --> 1:04:43.375
-Clyde doesn't want Pablo around anymore.
-What?

1:04:43.458 --> 1:04:46.083
-Git! Damn it, Pablo, git!
-Clyde, no!

1:04:46.166 --> 1:04:49.333
-Get away!
-Clyde, why would you say that? No!

1:04:49.416 --> 1:04:51.291
[crying] Clyde, please!

1:04:51.875 --> 1:04:54.708
Clyde!

1:04:57.583 --> 1:05:00.708
Oh, I guess that big idiot
really cared about us.

1:05:00.791 --> 1:05:02.416
Yeah, he really did.

1:05:04.375 --> 1:05:05.541
[laughing maniacally]

1:05:05.625 --> 1:05:08.250
[George] King James, we meet at last.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:11.500
Yes, yes. Kudos, Washington.

1:05:11.583 --> 1:05:16.166
I see that you managed to evade the trap
your old friend Benedict laid for you.

1:05:16.250 --> 1:05:17.541
Evade this, butter teeth!

1:05:18.125 --> 1:05:19.333
Sam, you're not gonna…

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:21.166
-[laughing]
-[Thomas] It's a hologram.

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:22.916
Where's my wife, you bastard?

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.166
I believe you mean…
Where is your future queen?

1:05:27.250 --> 1:05:28.250
Never!

1:05:28.333 --> 1:05:29.875
Oh, you'll come round.

1:05:29.958 --> 1:05:30.791
Martha!

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:35.000
If you lay even one
of your sausage fingers on her,

1:05:35.083 --> 1:05:36.750
I'll rip your fucking dick off!

1:05:36.833 --> 1:05:38.750
You better make it quick, George,

1:05:38.833 --> 1:05:42.041
because we're about
to become very well acquainted.

1:05:42.125 --> 1:05:44.416
No more repartee, James.

1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:45.750
No more games!

1:05:45.833 --> 1:05:48.541
I want you face-to-face.

1:05:48.625 --> 1:05:51.250
Hmm. What did you have in mind?

1:05:51.333 --> 1:05:52.458
Tomorrow.

1:05:52.541 --> 1:05:54.708
For all the fucking marbles.

1:05:54.791 --> 1:05:56.708
My squad. Your squad!

1:05:56.791 --> 1:06:01.166
You mean, your squad
and my giant fuck-off army!

1:06:01.250 --> 1:06:04.166
Bring me every Redcoat alive
for all I care.

1:06:04.250 --> 1:06:06.458
I'll bring extra gas for my chainsaws.

1:06:06.541 --> 1:06:09.583
I accept.
Tomorrow morning. Attrition Field.

1:06:09.666 --> 1:06:11.916
Eight o'clock, sharp. Don't be late.

1:06:12.666 --> 1:06:14.875
[Paul yelling] Clyde!

1:06:14.958 --> 1:06:16.416
[sobbing]

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.541
Hmm. He gonna be okay?

1:06:19.625 --> 1:06:23.083
You sacrificed Clyde… to save us?

1:06:23.166 --> 1:06:25.000
Clyde sacrificed himself.

1:06:25.083 --> 1:06:27.208
I love my new people friends,

1:06:27.291 --> 1:06:29.500
but I loved Clyde, too!

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:32.791
He was my brother!

1:06:34.291 --> 1:06:36.583
There's gotta be something we can do.

1:06:36.666 --> 1:06:39.125
Well, I'm in a book club
with Clara Barton.

1:06:40.458 --> 1:06:43.333
[scoffs] The groundbreaking
medical practitioner?

1:06:44.833 --> 1:06:46.625
His name's Clara?

1:06:47.208 --> 1:06:48.958
[Clara] I think I can save him.

1:06:49.041 --> 1:06:52.791
But it will require the full breadth
of my cybernetic research to do so.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:54.666
-Meaning?
-Meaning when I'm done…

1:06:54.750 --> 1:06:57.000
He'll be more machine than animal.

1:06:57.083 --> 1:06:58.333
And there's also a chance

1:06:58.416 --> 1:07:01.958
that at some point in the distant future,
he'll rise up against us and--

1:07:02.041 --> 1:07:04.708
The horse owes me three bucks,
so do what you gotta do, Doc.

1:07:04.791 --> 1:07:08.083
It's a long shot.
My nanotechnology is advanced,

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:10.916
but there's really just
no substitute for living tissue.

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.750
Go. I need to be alone with Clyde.

1:07:13.833 --> 1:07:15.375
Okay, Paul. Okay.

1:07:15.458 --> 1:07:17.125
[Paul sobs]

1:07:22.375 --> 1:07:23.541
[munching loudly]

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.416
Say what you will about these colonists,

1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:33.333
but frying a chicken
and putting it in a bucket,

1:07:33.416 --> 1:07:35.041
that's a solid idea.

1:07:36.833 --> 1:07:38.500
Aren't you thirsty, my queen?

1:07:38.583 --> 1:07:41.333
I'll never drink
your over-taxed tea, James.

1:07:41.416 --> 1:07:44.875
You'll feel much more agreeable
after a relaxing soak.

1:07:44.958 --> 1:07:47.708
Arnold, has milady's bath been drawn?

1:07:47.791 --> 1:07:50.625
Yes, my liege. Earl Grey, hot.

1:07:50.708 --> 1:07:52.083
Excellent!

1:07:52.166 --> 1:07:55.916
Oh! [laughing] Look at this,
it's a double-stuffed pizza crust.

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.208
Just… I mean,
do the maths, Arnold. It's impossible.

1:08:03.958 --> 1:08:04.833
[gags]

1:08:04.916 --> 1:08:05.833
Did you want some?

1:08:05.916 --> 1:08:07.666
Enjoy it while you can, James.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:10.333
Before my husband
rips your fucking dick off!

1:08:10.416 --> 1:08:14.916
My dear, now that my
Ultimate Doomsday Machine is complete,

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.958
your husband and his
band of traitorous ne'er-do-wells

1:08:19.041 --> 1:08:21.500
will soon be ripping their own dicks off.

1:08:21.583 --> 1:08:23.333
[laughs maniacally]

1:08:23.416 --> 1:08:26.666
-[scoffs] Why would they do that?
-Do what?

1:08:26.750 --> 1:08:28.416
Rip their own dicks off?

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:31.375
Because! That's why! [laughs maniacally]

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:33.958
Is he a cookie or is he a puss?

1:08:34.041 --> 1:08:37.625
You know what? I don't care.
He's my new best friend, that's who he is.

1:08:37.708 --> 1:08:38.708
[hesitates]

1:08:38.791 --> 1:08:43.125
Yes, my king, there is so much
this bountiful new land has to offer.

1:08:43.208 --> 1:08:46.791
Yes. And which corner
of my new kingdom

1:08:46.875 --> 1:08:48.833
will you choose to rule, I wonder?

1:08:48.916 --> 1:08:49.750
[gasps] Oh!

1:08:49.833 --> 1:08:53.666
Why don't you take a Dakota?
Hell, take both.

1:08:53.750 --> 1:08:58.041
Why don't I take the whole thing?
[laughs]

1:08:59.125 --> 1:09:00.416
But why?

1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:04.083
Because, you double-stuffed buffoon,
why would I want to eat a slice…

1:09:04.166 --> 1:09:05.375
Oh, my God!

1:09:05.458 --> 1:09:08.666
…when I can eat the whole a-pizza pie?

1:09:11.208 --> 1:09:12.333
[munching loudly]

1:09:13.916 --> 1:09:17.708
Finally, freedom has a birthday. Tomorrow.

1:09:19.083 --> 1:09:20.500
So, go home.

1:09:20.583 --> 1:09:22.208
Go home to your friends,

1:09:22.791 --> 1:09:25.500
to your families, to your loved ones.

1:09:26.416 --> 1:09:28.833
And then, ready your arsenals.

1:09:28.916 --> 1:09:31.250
Bring not the weapons
you would use to topple men,

1:09:31.958 --> 1:09:36.041
but the weapons
that you would use to topple armies.

1:09:36.875 --> 1:09:39.458
The weapons
you would use to topple nations.

1:09:40.041 --> 1:09:43.458
For tomorrow, our revolution dies

1:09:43.541 --> 1:09:46.125
and America is born.

1:09:48.666 --> 1:09:50.250
Guide me, old friend.

1:09:50.750 --> 1:09:52.166
Show me the way.

1:09:53.833 --> 1:09:57.250
[Abe] George, I wish I had
a million friends like you!

1:09:57.333 --> 1:09:58.791
…a million friends…

1:09:58.875 --> 1:10:01.625
Abe, you forward-thinking son of bitch!

1:10:01.708 --> 1:10:05.083
But we're still
gonna need a lot of firepower.

1:10:08.541 --> 1:10:12.291
[man] Well, hey, welcome to Y'all Mart.
How can I help you?

1:10:12.375 --> 1:10:14.041
Oh, hey, how's it goin'? I need guns.

1:10:14.125 --> 1:10:15.875
Well, bless your heart.

1:10:15.958 --> 1:10:18.875
And did you have
any particular type in mind?

1:10:18.958 --> 1:10:22.791
Um, whatever the firearm equivalent
of a massive overreaction would be.

1:10:22.875 --> 1:10:24.666
Like, for every bullet fired at me,

1:10:24.750 --> 1:10:26.958
I'd want to be able
to fire several hundred in return.

1:10:27.041 --> 1:10:31.166
Oh, I see.
And what do you plan on using them for?

1:10:32.875 --> 1:10:34.208
-Hunting?
-Perfect!

1:10:34.291 --> 1:10:36.208
I can definitely help you with that.

1:10:36.291 --> 1:10:38.250
Now, we do have a waiting period.

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:42.041
And it's over.
Let's get you heavily armed, big fella.

1:10:42.125 --> 1:10:45.416
Fantastic!
Say, aren't you Mr. Kinko's boy?

1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:49.583
Yes, sir. Frederick Xavier Kinko.
Nice to meet ya.

1:10:49.666 --> 1:10:52.333
Well, Fred X. Kinko, that's convenient.

1:10:52.416 --> 1:10:54.166
I'm also looking for a photocopier.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:56.041
The best in the colonies.

1:11:04.458 --> 1:11:05.541
Were you able to sleep?

1:11:05.625 --> 1:11:06.791
-Yeah.
-Slept like a log.

1:11:06.875 --> 1:11:10.500
Neither was I. No matter,
we'll all sleep soon enough…

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:12.916
in the beds of vanquished kings.

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.375
Wow, that was beautiful phrasing.
You're gettin' pretty good at this.

1:11:16.458 --> 1:11:18.375
You like that? Really? Check this out.

1:11:18.458 --> 1:11:21.166
Teamwork, it makes the dream work.

1:11:21.250 --> 1:11:23.625
Whoa! He's right. It does.

1:11:23.708 --> 1:11:26.375
Okay, that, right there,
that's leadership.

1:11:26.458 --> 1:11:30.416
Thanks, guys. Look, man,
I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty confident.

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.916
Maybe things
are going to work out after all.

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.875
-Holy shit.
-Fuck me.

1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:16.958
All right. I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

1:12:17.583 --> 1:12:20.833
Three against ten thousand?
That's pretty bad odds.

1:12:21.416 --> 1:12:23.791
-For us.
-Well, we have the high ground.

1:12:23.875 --> 1:12:25.916
You have more than the high ground.

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.625
Geronimo! Blacksmith!
We thought you deserted.

1:12:28.708 --> 1:12:33.000
Thought about it, like, really hard,
then started going in the other direction.

1:12:33.083 --> 1:12:35.958
Even booked an Air T&P
on the opposite side of town.

1:12:36.041 --> 1:12:38.375
But despite my better judgment,

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:40.791
I ate the deposit and decided to come.

1:12:41.333 --> 1:12:43.166
Because this is my land

1:12:43.250 --> 1:12:46.333
and I don't need
anybody's permission to defend it.

1:12:46.416 --> 1:12:49.000
And Mr. Smith,
you'll join the fight as well?

1:12:49.083 --> 1:12:51.708
I figured, if we're gonna end up
with an old white dude in charge,

1:12:51.791 --> 1:12:54.291
we could do a hell of
a lot worse than you, George Washington.

1:12:54.375 --> 1:12:56.125
You're one of the good-ish ones.

1:12:57.125 --> 1:12:59.500
All that silver… for one bullet.

1:12:59.583 --> 1:13:01.708
Yeah, so you better make it count.

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:04.291
We will, and we'll do it in style.

1:13:04.375 --> 1:13:05.250
[Samuel] Yeah.

1:13:05.333 --> 1:13:08.166
I commissioned Betsy Ross
and Tim Gunn to make these last night.

1:13:08.250 --> 1:13:10.291
Tim Gunn? Sounds like a badass.

1:13:10.375 --> 1:13:14.750
My dream, as silly as it seems now,
was that after our victory today,

1:13:14.833 --> 1:13:17.250
this design
would become a national symbol.

1:13:17.333 --> 1:13:19.583
The first ever American flag.

1:13:19.666 --> 1:13:23.666
-A symbol of our indomitable spirit.
-Of our thirst for knowledge!

1:13:23.750 --> 1:13:26.250
Of our tireless quest to kick ass!

1:13:26.333 --> 1:13:28.583
And, and! I'm just spitballing here,

1:13:28.666 --> 1:13:31.333
but maybe this style of blouse
will become the uniform

1:13:31.416 --> 1:13:34.291
of the first ever
American national pastime.

1:13:34.375 --> 1:13:37.375
It'll be like cricket,
but with actual rules.

1:13:37.458 --> 1:13:40.208
And you won't even
have to be athletic to participate.

1:13:40.291 --> 1:13:43.000
-Or have two arms.
-And women can play, too.

1:13:43.083 --> 1:13:45.166
You know, don't…
Let's not get sidetracked.

1:13:45.250 --> 1:13:46.500
Hark, the national bird!

1:13:46.583 --> 1:13:48.416
[Geronimo] You took everything else.

1:13:48.500 --> 1:13:51.333
You know what we need now?
A national song.

1:13:51.416 --> 1:13:52.958
I believe you mean…

1:13:56.333 --> 1:13:58.291
a national anthem.

How did you reach
this many people overnight?

1:16:06.583 --> 1:16:10.916
I remembered something
one of my friends told me about flyers.

1:16:11.583 --> 1:16:14.666
They're a great way to communicate

How can you be so sure
that this will work?

1:23:39.791 --> 1:23:43.333
Well, I'm not sure, Sammy,
but I have a hypothesis.

1:23:43.916 --> 1:23:48.083

and draw some fucking conclusions!

-No! I won't do it! Ah!

Fine, resist. And I'll gain full custody
of our son the moment he is born.

1:24:34.333 --> 1:24:36.750
And you'll be helpless to stop it.

1:24:36.833 --> 1:24:42.375

what the fuck is it?

1:27:48.791 --> 1:27:50.333
[grunting]

1:27:52.791 --> 1:27:55.416
[growling]

1:27:58.416 --> 1:27:59.541
[grunts]

1:28:03.166 --> 1:28:05.333
Guys, I don't know
how much more he can take!

1:28:05.416 --> 1:28:07.458
-Where's the stupid bullet?
-We're looking!

1:28:07.541 --> 1:28:10.458
Any last regrets, old chum?

1:28:10.541 --> 1:28:15.208
Yeah, I only regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:20.208
Yes. Well, I suppose
the one will have to do.

1:28:20.291 --> 1:28:23.416
Oh, shit! It's right here.
Guys! I found it!

1:28:24.541 --> 1:28:27.625
What are you smiling about, you idiot?
You can't possibly kill me.

1:28:27.708 --> 1:28:29.791
I'm not trying to kill you, Ben.

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:34.083
They are. With America's favorite pastime.

1:28:34.166 --> 1:28:35.083
No!

1:28:39.791 --> 1:28:41.166
Tax this, motherfucker!

1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:48.583
[commentator]
It's going way back to right field.

1:28:48.666 --> 1:28:50.916
The bullet is still going!
High up in there!

1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.041
-Bugger!
-He did it!

1:28:53.833 --> 1:28:56.166
John Henry Smith did it!

1:28:56.250 --> 1:28:57.458
[all cheer]

1:29:01.583 --> 1:29:05.875
Welcome to America!

1:29:11.041 --> 1:29:12.875
[cheering]

1:29:16.833 --> 1:29:18.625
[whooping]

1:29:36.208 --> 1:29:38.125
[George] I wanna make a monument
for Abe, too.

1:29:38.208 --> 1:29:40.583
But of course, Mr. President.
Same as yours?

1:29:40.666 --> 1:29:41.750
No, I.M. Pei.

1:29:41.833 --> 1:29:47.500
His should be a statue of him
sitting there, staring at my monument.

1:29:47.583 --> 1:29:49.500
[Abe chuckling] Who are you, Demi Moore?

1:29:49.583 --> 1:29:51.625
Why you gotta screw
a ghost like that, George?

1:29:51.708 --> 1:29:54.916
Abe! Ah, bro!
God, it's good to see you again, man.

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:58.958
Well, you're gonna feel like a real turd
after you see what I brought you. Hah!

1:29:59.041 --> 1:30:00.916
The Declaration! You saved it!

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:01.916
I did.

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.041
A little of Mr. Scotch's invisible tape
and it's as good as new.

1:30:05.125 --> 1:30:06.166
It's beautiful, Abe.

1:30:06.250 --> 1:30:09.916
It is, but you're the real
national treasure here, George.

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:11.458
I'm proud of you, bud.

1:30:13.541 --> 1:30:16.708
And no, there's no treasure map
drawn on the back of it.

1:30:16.791 --> 1:30:18.833
-Oh, man.
-George, what are you doin', bro?

1:30:18.916 --> 1:30:20.708
-They're lookin' for you out there.
-Oh, Sam!

1:30:20.791 --> 1:30:23.125
I'm glad you're here.
I have something for you.

1:30:23.208 --> 1:30:26.375
-What is it?
-A gift for my son's godfather.

1:30:26.458 --> 1:30:27.708
-Who, me?
-Yep.

1:30:27.791 --> 1:30:31.083
I need someone
I can trust with my son's life.

1:30:31.166 --> 1:30:33.250
And I always thought it would be Abe.

1:30:33.333 --> 1:30:37.041
But with him as a gho… a goner,
I need to find someone else.

1:30:37.125 --> 1:30:39.166
George, I'm honored!

1:30:39.250 --> 1:30:40.666
Hey, is that my hat? Oh, it is.

1:30:40.750 --> 1:30:43.916
But… Ugh. I don't know
how to be a caretaker.

1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:45.458
I don't have those instincts.

1:30:45.541 --> 1:30:47.916
No, don't think of it
as being the caretaker.

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.333
Think of it as being family.

1:30:49.416 --> 1:30:50.750
Like the fun, drunk,

1:30:50.833 --> 1:30:55.833
now definitely no-longer-racist uncle
that America has always needed.

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:58.875
Uncle Sam. I like It.

1:30:58.958 --> 1:31:00.875
Uncle fucking Sam!

1:31:00.958 --> 1:31:04.250
Come on, Uncle Sam, our countrymen await.

1:31:05.916 --> 1:31:08.666
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1:31:14.625 --> 1:31:15.708
Hey, Denzel.

1:31:15.791 --> 1:31:16.708
[giggles]

1:31:18.083 --> 1:31:19.583
[crowd cheers]

1:31:26.458 --> 1:31:28.000
My fellow Americans,

1:31:28.083 --> 1:31:32.750
on this day, July 4th, 1776,

1:31:32.833 --> 1:31:36.916
we are all finally free!

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.958
[all cheer]

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:49.666
[man 1] What about your slaves?

1:31:49.750 --> 1:31:52.416
Oh! Um…

1:31:52.500 --> 1:31:56.916
-I said, what about your slaves?
-[George] Well, see--

1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:58.375
And what about women?

1:31:58.458 --> 1:32:01.291
Will we be granted equality
in your America?

1:32:01.375 --> 1:32:04.250
-Yes, but--
-Sure, right after the Indians.

1:32:04.333 --> 1:32:07.750
Wait a second. I was under the impression
we were getting our land back.

1:32:07.833 --> 1:32:08.833
Good point. Um…

1:32:08.916 --> 1:32:10.791
Oh, hey, can I keep this here machine gun?

1:32:10.875 --> 1:32:13.541
Like, if a Mexican
tries to take my property or something?

1:32:13.625 --> 1:32:15.833
What? You just took this land
from the Indians--

1:32:15.916 --> 1:32:17.583
He was coming for you. I saw it!

1:32:17.666 --> 1:32:20.958
-He just shot him! In the back!
-He was making a move, man. I swear it!

1:32:21.041 --> 1:32:24.583
We're gonna have a fair
and unbiased judicial process, right?

1:32:24.666 --> 1:32:27.041
-Everyone, just calm down!
-Fuck you!

1:32:27.125 --> 1:32:28.541
No, fuck you!

1:32:28.625 --> 1:32:30.791
Hey, I just wanna marry my boyfriend.

1:32:31.458 --> 1:32:32.500
Sinner!

1:32:32.583 --> 1:32:34.875
There's gonna be
comprehensive health care, right?

1:32:36.083 --> 1:32:38.958
[man 1] Seriously, dude.
What about your slaves?

1:32:39.041 --> 1:32:42.541
Oh, God.
We're gonna fuck this up, aren't we?

1:33:35.541 --> 1:33:38.291
Dagnabbit! I think we missed it, E's.

1:33:38.375 --> 1:33:40.083
[growls weakly]
