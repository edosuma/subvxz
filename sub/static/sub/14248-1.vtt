00:28.161 --> 00:29.150
Damage report!

00:29.229 --> 00:30.662
Shields at 60 percent.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.960
Our fuel line has ruptured.
Attempting to compensate.

00:35.101 --> 00:38.036
Damn it! We're barely
maintaining impulse.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.503
l can't get any more out of it.

00:39.572 --> 00:40.937
Be creative.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.565
How am l supposed to be creative

00:42.642 --> 00:44.473
with a 39-year-old
rebuilt engine?

00:45.512 --> 00:47.207
Maquis ship

00:47.280 --> 00:50.010
this is Gul Evek
of the Cardassian Fourth Order.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.517
Cut your engines and prepare
to surrender or we will de...

00:56.456 --> 00:59.254
lnitiating evasive pattern
omega. Mark.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.921
Shields at 50 percent.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.055
l need more power

01:05.131 --> 01:06.723
if we're going to make
it to the Badlands.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.926
Take the weapons off-line.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.969
We'll transfer all power
to the engines.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.060
Considering the circumstances,

01:11.137 --> 01:13.105
l'd question that proposal
at this time.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.105
What does it matter?!

01:14.174 --> 01:17.234
We're not making a dent
in their shields anyway.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.335
You wanted creative.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.346
Tuvok, shut down
all the phaser banks.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.814
lf you can give me another
30 seconds at full impulse,

01:23.883 --> 01:25.612
l'll get us into the Badlands.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.277
Phasers off-line.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.150
Throw the last photons at them

01:29.222 --> 01:31.918
and then give me the power
from the torpedo systems.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.516
Acknowledged.
Firing photons.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.998
Are you reading
any plasma storms ahead?

01:43.069 --> 01:46.334
One.
Coordinates 17 1 mark 43.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.262
That's where l'm going.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.242
Plasma storm density
increasing by 14 percent.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.938
Twenty...

01:53.012 --> 01:54.445
Twenty-five...

01:54.514 --> 01:55.538
Hold on!

02:03.089 --> 02:05.148
Cardassian ship
is not reducing power.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.157
They're following us in.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.660
Gul Evek must feel daring today.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.231
They've taken a hit
on their port blade.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.929
They're sending out
a distress signal

02:18.037 --> 02:19.698
on all Cardassian frequencies.

02:19.772 --> 02:20.739
Can you plot a course

02:20.807 --> 02:22.274
through these plasma fields,
Mr. Tuvok?

02:22.342 --> 02:25.243
Storm's activity is typically
widespread in this vicinity.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.370
l can plot a course,
but l'm afraid it will require

02:27.447 --> 02:28.436
an indirect route.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.210
We can use the time
to make some repairs.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.842
What was that?

02:32.919 --> 02:33.977
Curious.

02:34.087 --> 02:37.420
We just passed through some kind
of coherent tetryon beam.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.354
Source?

02:38.424 --> 02:39.391
Unknown.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.417
Now there appears to be

02:41.494 --> 02:42.961
a massive displacement wave
moving toward us.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.462
Another storm?

02:44.531 --> 02:46.158
lt's not a plasma phenomenon.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.290
At current speeds

02:47.367 --> 02:49.597
it will intercept us
in less than 30 seconds.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.035
Anything left in those
impulse generators, B'Elanna?

02:52.138 --> 02:53.105
We'll find out.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.368
Still exceeding our speed.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.033
Maximum power.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.771
Wave is continuing
to accelerate.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.177
lt will intercept us
in eight seconds.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.142
Five.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.413
Tom Paris?

05:22.388 --> 05:24.413
Kathryn Janeway.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.924
l served with your father
on the Al-Batani.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.429
l wonder if we could
go somewhere and talk?

05:30.496 --> 05:32.293
About what?

05:32.365 --> 05:34.833
About a job we'd like
you to do for us.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.335
l'm already doing a job...

05:37.403 --> 05:38.734
for the Federation.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.670
l've been told
the Rehab Commission

05:40.740 --> 05:42.571
is very pleased with your work.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.975
They've given me their approval
to discuss this matter with you.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.980
Well, then l guess l'm yours.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.481
Your father taught me
a great deal.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.648
l was his Science Officer
during the Arias Expedition.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.692
You must be good.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.557
My father only accepts
the best and the brightest.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.529
l'm leaving on a mission
to find a Maquis ship

06:05.565 --> 06:08.363
that disappeared in
the Badlands a week ago.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.595
l wouldn't, if l were you.

06:10.670 --> 06:11.967
Really?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.563
l've never seen
a Federation starship

06:14.640 --> 06:16.631
that could maneuver
through the plasma storms.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.041
You've never seen Voyager.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.707
We'd like you to come along.

06:23.182 --> 06:26.982
You'd like me to lead you
to my former colleagues.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.913
l was only with the Maquis
a few weeks

06:30.022 --> 06:31.387
before l was captured, Captain.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.153
l don't know where most
of their hiding places are.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.196
You know the territory
better than anyone we've got.

06:37.263 --> 06:40.721
What's so important about
this particular Maquis ship?

06:40.800 --> 06:44.258
My Chief of Security
was on board-- undercover.

06:44.337 --> 06:47.397
He was supposed to report in
twice during the last six days.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.906
He didn't.

06:48.975 --> 06:52.172
Maybe it's just your Chief
of Security who's disappeared.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.577
Maybe.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.113
That ship was under the command

06:57.183 --> 06:58.172
of another former

06:58.251 --> 06:59.718
Starfleet officer

06:59.786 --> 07:01.048
named Chakotay.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.283
l understand you knew him.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.848
That's right.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.157
The two of you didn't get along
too well, l'm told.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.062
Chakotay will tell you
he left Starfleet on principle--

07:13.132 --> 07:16.727
to defend his home colony
from the Cardassians.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.033
l, on the other hand,
was forced to resign.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.232
He considered me a mercenary--

07:21.307 --> 07:24.140
willing to fight for anyone
who'd pay my bar bills.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.145
The trouble is he was right.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.284
l have no problem helping you

07:32.351 --> 07:35.479
track down my ''friends''
in the Maquis, Captain.

07:35.555 --> 07:39.150
All l need to know from you
is what's in it for me?

07:39.225 --> 07:41.022
You help us find that ship

07:41.093 --> 07:44.153
we help you
at your next outmate review.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.130
Uh-huh.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.359
Officially, you'd be

07:47.433 --> 07:49.424
a Starfleet observer
during the mission.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.094
Observer?!

07:52.605 --> 07:55.130
Oh, hell, l'm the best pilot
you could have.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.108
You'll be an observer.

07:57.176 --> 08:00.111
When it's over,
you're cut loose.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.670
Story of my life.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.790
Stadi, you're changing
my mind about Betazoids.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.595
Good.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.601
Oh, that wasn't a compliment.

08:23.669 --> 08:29.005
Until today, l always considered
your people warm and sensual.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.908
l can be warm and sensual.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.275
Just not to me.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.337
Do you always fly at women
at warp speed, Mr. Paris?

08:36.414 --> 08:39.145
Only when they're
in visual range.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.847
That's our ship.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.481
That's Voyager.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.150
lntrepid-class--

08:47.226 --> 08:49.558
sustainable cruise
velocity of warp factor

08:49.629 --> 08:51.722
9.97 5.

08:51.797 --> 08:55.927
15 decks,
crew complement of 141.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.970
Bio-neural circuitry.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.594
Bio-neural?

08:59.672 --> 09:00.661
Some of the traditional

09:00.773 --> 09:03.298
circuitry has been
replaced by gel packs

09:03.342 --> 09:05.276
that contain bio-neural cells.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.574
They organize information
more efficiently--

09:07.647 --> 09:09.581
speed up response time.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.996
lf l may say so,
it's been my special pleasure

09:35.074 --> 09:37.167
to see many new officers
like yourself

09:37.243 --> 09:39.006
come through these portals.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.172
Your parents must be
very proud, my boy.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.115
You know, on an occasion
like this...

09:45.184 --> 09:46.242
l'm really not interested.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.513
lnterested?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.384
You were about to try
to sell me something, right?

09:49.455 --> 09:51.082
l was merely going to suggest

09:51.157 --> 09:53.284
that your parents
might appreciate a memento

09:53.359 --> 09:54.291
of your first mission.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.794
And you happen to have several
to choose from?

09:56.862 --> 09:59.592
l do carry a select line

09:59.665 --> 10:02.259
of unique artifacts
and gemstones

10:02.335 --> 10:04.030
indigenous to this region.

10:04.103 --> 10:08.164
Why, quite recently,
l acquired these Lobi crystals

10:08.240 --> 10:11.266
from a very strange creature
called a Morn.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.904
We were warned about the Ferengi
at the Academy.

10:14.914 --> 10:16.973
Warned about Ferengi, were you?

10:17.083 --> 10:18.448
That's right.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.975
Slurs about my people
at Starfleet Academy.

10:22.054 --> 10:22.986
What l meant was...

10:23.089 --> 10:26.752
Here l am, trying to be
a cordial host, knowing

10:26.826 --> 10:29.795
how much a young officer's
parents would appreciate

10:29.862 --> 10:32.956
a token of his love on the eve
of a dangerous mission

10:33.032 --> 10:35.125
and what do l get
for my trouble?

10:35.201 --> 10:37.328
Scurrilous insults.

10:37.403 --> 10:40.998
Well, somebody's
going to hear about this.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.371
What's your name, son?

10:43.442 --> 10:45.342
My... name?

10:45.411 --> 10:46.503
You have one, l presume?

10:46.579 --> 10:47.705
Kim, Harry Kim, but l...

10:47.780 --> 10:48.769
And who was it

10:48.848 --> 10:51.681
at the Academy who warned you
about Ferengi?

10:51.751 --> 10:53.446
You know, l think
a memento for my parents

10:53.519 --> 10:54.451
would be a great idea.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.953
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

10:56.022 --> 10:57.717
Really, one of these

10:57.790 --> 10:59.223
would make a great pendant
for my mother.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.451
Or cufflinks for your father.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.494
Cufflinks.
Great idea.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.358
They're not for sale.

11:04.430 --> 11:08.264
Now, inform
your commanding officer

11:08.334 --> 11:12.168
that the Federation Council
can expect an official query...

11:12.238 --> 11:13.830
How much for the entire tray?

11:16.042 --> 11:17.509
Cash or credit?

11:17.576 --> 11:19.441
Dazzling, aren't they?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.537
As bright as a Koladan diamond.

11:21.614 --> 11:22.876
Brighter.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.279
Hard to believe
you can find them

11:24.350 --> 11:25.578
on any planet in the system.

11:25.651 --> 11:26.675
That's an exaggeration.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.949
You know, there's a shop
at the Volnar Colony

11:30.022 --> 11:31.990
that sells
a dozen assorted shapes

11:32.058 --> 11:33.491
for one Cardassian lek.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.720
How much are you
selling these for?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.628
We were just about
to negotiate the price.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.760
Come on.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.175
Thanks.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.473
Didn't they warn you about
Ferengi at the Academy?

12:01.087 --> 12:03.715
Run a level-3 diagnostic
just to be sure.

12:05.858 --> 12:06.916
Can l help you?

12:07.026 --> 12:09.290
Tom Paris, reporting on board.

12:09.361 --> 12:10.726
Oh, yes.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.094
The observer.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.462
That's me.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.932
As a matter of fact,
l seem to be observing

12:19.004 --> 12:21.165
some kind of problem
right now...

12:21.240 --> 12:22.935
Doctor.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.910
l was a surgeon
at the hospital on Caldik Prime

12:26.979 --> 12:29.743
the same time you were
stationed there.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.305
We never actually met.

12:33.519 --> 12:34.952
Your medical records
have arrived

12:35.020 --> 12:36.510
from your last posting,
Mr. Paris.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.989
Everything seems to be
in order.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.788
The Captain asked
if you were on board.

12:41.861 --> 12:42.919
You should check in with her.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.360
Uh...

12:44.430 --> 12:46.421
l haven't paid my respects
to the Captain yet either.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.662
Well, Mr. Kim,
that would be a good thing

12:49.735 --> 12:51.703
for a new
Operations Officer to do.

12:56.809 --> 12:57.935
What was that all about?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.136
lt's a long story, Harry

12:59.211 --> 13:00.405
and l'm tired of telling it.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.674
l'm sure someone around here
will tell you before long.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.705
The doctor called.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.716
And?

13:05.785 --> 13:06.809
And l was right.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.012
She's pregnant?

13:08.087 --> 13:09.611
Puppies are due in seven weeks.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.087
Oh, Mark, you've got
to take her home with you.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.022
With me?

13:13.092 --> 13:14.423
l just got the rugs cleaned.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.460
She's with child.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.086
l can't leave her
in a kennel while l...

13:17.163 --> 13:19.757
ls this another ''love me,
love my dog'' demand?

13:19.832 --> 13:21.094
Yes.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.464
How could l ever refuse you?

13:22.535 --> 13:23.695
Thanks, honey.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.100
So when are you leaving?

13:25.171 --> 13:27.639
As soon as l approve
these system status reports.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.641
All right, then l won't
bother you anymore.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.142
Hey...

13:34.980 --> 13:36.880
you never bother me.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.816
Except the way l love
to be bothered.

13:39.885 --> 13:40.817
Understand?

13:40.886 --> 13:42.649
l'll remember that.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.416
See you in a few weeks.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.287
Oh, Mark, go by my house
and pick up the doggy bed.

13:46.358 --> 13:47.655
She'll be more comfortable.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.421
l already did.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.622
An hour ago.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.666
Come in.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.843
Gentlemen,
welcome aboard Voyager.

14:08.914 --> 14:09.881
Thank you, sir.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.246
Mr. Kim...

14:13.319 --> 14:15.947
at ease
before you sprain something.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.487
Ensign, despite
Starfleet protocol

14:19.558 --> 14:21.617
l don't like being
addressed as ''sir.''

14:21.694 --> 14:23.889
l'm sorry... ma'am.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.863
''Ma'am'' is acceptable
in a crunch,

14:25.931 --> 14:27.489
but l prefer ''Captain.''

14:27.566 --> 14:29.898
We're getting ready to leave.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.436
Let me show you to the Bridge.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.131
Did you have any problems
getting here, Mr. Paris?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.265
None at all, Captain.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.946
My First Officer,
Lieutenant Commander Cavit.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.378
Ensign Kim, Mr. Paris.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.575
Welcome aboard.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.750
Ensign Kim,
this is your station.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.924
Would you like to take over?

14:57.997 --> 14:59.828
Yes, ma'am.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.129
lt's not crunch time yet,
Mr. Kim.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.599
l'll let you know when.

15:08.374 --> 15:09.864
Lieutenant Stadi,
lay in the course

15:09.975 --> 15:11.966
and clear our departure
with Operations.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.444
Course entered,
Ops has cleared us.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.242
Ready thrusters.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.441
Thrusters ready.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.541
lnitiate launching sequence.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.916
Sequence underway.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.011
Engage.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.362
Tomato soup.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.696
There are 14 varieties
of tomato soup available

16:08.767 --> 16:12.203
from this replicator--
with rice, with vegetables,

16:12.271 --> 16:14.364
Bolian-style,
with pasta, with...

16:14.440 --> 16:15.407
Plain.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.669
Specify hot or chilled.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.005
Hot!

16:19.078 --> 16:21.512
Hot, plain tomato soup.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.116
There, you see?

16:36.195 --> 16:38.060
l told you
it wouldn't take long.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.363
ls it true?

16:41.433 --> 16:43.128
Was the accident my fault?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.829
Yes-- pilot error--

16:44.903 --> 16:47.929
but it took me
a while to admit it.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.142
Ugh! 14 varieties

16:51.210 --> 16:53.906
and they can't even get
plain tomato soup right.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.072
They said you falsified reports.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.172
That's right.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.216
Why?

16:58.283 --> 17:00.080
What's the difference?
l lied.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.414
But then you came forward

17:01.487 --> 17:03.512
and you admitted
that it was your fault?

17:05.124 --> 17:07.957
l'll tell you the truth, Harry.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.155
All l had to do
was keep my mouth shut

17:11.230 --> 17:13.095
and l was home free...

17:13.165 --> 17:14.189
but l couldn't.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.429
The ghosts of those
three dead officers

17:17.502 --> 17:19.060
came to me
in the middle of the night

17:19.137 --> 17:21.071
and taught me
the true meaning of Christmas.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.506
So l confessed--

17:23.575 --> 17:27.671
worst mistake l ever made
but not my last.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.772
After they cashiered me
out of Starfleet,

17:30.849 --> 17:33.682
l went out looking for a fight
and found the Maquis,

17:33.752 --> 17:38.519
and on my first assignment,
l was caught.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.718
That must have been
especially tough for you,

17:41.794 --> 17:43.659
being the son of an admiral.

17:43.729 --> 17:48.132
Frankly, l think it was tougher
on my father than it was on me.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.265
Look.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.306
l know those guys told you
to stay away from me,

17:55.374 --> 17:56.932
and you know what?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.907
You ought to listen to them.

17:58.977 --> 18:02.310
l'm not exactly
a good-luck charm.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.913
l don't need anyone
to choose my friends for me.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.019
Janeway to Paris.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.419
Go ahead.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.581
Report to the Bridge.

18:11.657 --> 18:12.988
We're approaching the Badlands.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.097
The plasma storms were measured
at levels three and four.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.331
The Cardassians gave us
the last known heading

18:27.406 --> 18:30.034
of the Maquis ship,
and we have charts

18:30.109 --> 18:32.634
of the plasma storm activity
the day it disappeared.

18:32.711 --> 18:33.905
With a little help,

18:33.979 --> 18:35.776
we might be able to
approximate its course.

18:35.848 --> 18:36.780
l'd guess

18:36.849 --> 18:38.646
they were trying to get
to one of the M-Class

18:38.717 --> 18:40.742
planetoids in the Terikof Belt.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.343
That's beyond the Moriya system

18:42.421 --> 18:45.549
The plasma storms would have
forced them in this direction.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.785
Adjust our course to match.

18:47.860 --> 18:48.792
Aye, Captain.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.226
The Cardassians claim
they forced

18:50.295 --> 18:52.160
the Maquis ship
into a plasma storm

18:52.231 --> 18:53.630
where it was destroyed,

18:53.699 --> 18:55.530
but our probes haven't
picked up any debris.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.365
A plasma storm might not leave
any debris.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.802
We'd still be able to pick up

18:59.872 --> 19:01.533
a resonance trace
from the warp core.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.834
Captain.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.966
l'm reading a coherent
tetryon beam scanning us.

19:05.043 --> 19:06.738
Origin, Mr. Kim?

19:06.812 --> 19:07.779
l'm not sure.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.473
There's also a displacement wave
moving toward us.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.140
On screen.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.183
Analysis.

19:15.254 --> 19:18.087
Some kind of polarized
magnetic variation.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.853
We might be able to disperse it
with a graviton particle field.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.052
Do it.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.219
Red Alert.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.694
Move us away from it,
Lieutenant.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.755
New heading 41 mark 180.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.498
lnitiating graviton field.

19:37.276 --> 19:38.800
The graviton field
had no effect.

19:38.877 --> 19:40.970
Full impulse.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.678
The wave will intercept us
in 12 seconds.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.242
Can we go to warp?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.584
Not until we clear
the plasma field, Captain.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.590
Five seconds.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.148
Brace for impact.

19:54.226 --> 19:55.022
Three...

20:31.196 --> 20:32.254
Report.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.930
Hull breach, deck 14.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.262
Com lines
to Engineering are down.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.597
Trying to reestablish.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.203
Repair crews, seal off
hull breach on deck 14.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.264
Aye, Captain.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.311
Casualty reports coming in.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.039
Sick Bay is not responding.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.171
Bridge to Sick Bay.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.738
Doctor, can you hear me?

20:51.850 --> 20:53.875
Paris, how's Stadi?

20:53.952 --> 20:55.886
She's dead.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.251
Captain, there's
something out there.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.984
l need a better description
than that, Mr. Kim.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.116
l don't know.

21:01.159 --> 21:02.456
l'm reading...

21:02.494 --> 21:03.791
l'm not sure what l'm reading.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.659
Can you get
the viewscreen operational?

21:05.731 --> 21:07.221
l'm trying.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.109
Captain,
if these sensors are working

21:24.182 --> 21:27.117
we're over 70,000 light-years
from where we were.

21:27.185 --> 21:30.018
We're on the other side
of the galaxy.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.834
l'm not reading any life signs
on the Maquis ship.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.530
What about on that...
that Array?

21:46.605 --> 21:48.505
Our sensors can't penetrate it.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.870
Any idea what those pulses are

21:49.941 --> 21:51.374
that are coming from it,
Mr. Kim?

21:51.443 --> 21:52.535
Massive bursts
of radiant energy.

21:52.611 --> 21:53.600
They seem to be directed

21:53.679 --> 21:55.146
toward a nearby
G-type star system.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.840
Try hailing the Array.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.382
Engineering to Bridge.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.441
We have severe damage.
The chief's dead.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.350
Possibility
of a warp core breach.

22:02.421 --> 22:05.015
Secure all engineering systems.
l'm on my way.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.148
No response from the Array.

22:06.224 --> 22:07.919
Ensign, get down to Sick Bay.
See what's going on.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.358
Mr. Rollins,
the Bridge is yours.

22:09.428 --> 22:10.918
Aye, Captain.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.097
Harry, wait for me.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.410
They must have been

22:34.486 --> 22:36.113
right next to the console
when it exploded.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.798
Warning.
Warp core micro-fracture.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.201
Breach imminent.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.307
What's the warp core pressure?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.842
2,100 kilopascals.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.602
Lock down
the magnetic constrictors.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.943
lf we lock them down
at these pressure levels,

23:03.982 --> 23:05.415
we might not be able
to reinitialize

23:05.484 --> 23:06.416
the dilithium reaction.

23:06.485 --> 23:07.645
Warning.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.516
Warp core microfracture.
Breach imminent.

23:09.588 --> 23:10.520
We don't have a choice.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.749
We've got to get
the reaction rate

23:11.823 --> 23:13.814
down
before we try to seal it.

23:14.793 --> 23:15.760
Computer, initiate

23:15.827 --> 23:17.454
emergency medical
holographic program.

23:20.465 --> 23:23.059
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

23:23.135 --> 23:24.261
Multiple percussive injuries.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.360
Status of your doctor?

23:25.437 --> 23:26.404
He's dead.

23:26.471 --> 23:27.699
.4cc's of trianoline.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.240
Trianoline?

23:29.307 --> 23:31.002
We lost our nurse, too.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.708
How soon are replacement
medical personnel expected?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.270
That could be a problem.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.339
We're pretty far away
from replacements right now.

23:40.051 --> 23:41.313
Tricorder.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.315
Medical tricorder.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.225
A replacement must be requested
as soon as possible.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.895
l am programmed
only as a short-term

23:59.971 --> 24:01.836
emergency supplement
to the medical team.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.875
Well, we may be stuck
with you for a while, Doc.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.571
There's no need for concern.

24:06.645 --> 24:09.239
l am capable of treating
any injury or disease.

24:09.314 --> 24:10.440
No concussion.
You'll be fine.

24:10.515 --> 24:11.504
Clean him up.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.758
Unlock the magnetic
constrictors.

24:28.433 --> 24:29.593
Constrictors on line.

24:29.668 --> 24:30.930
Pressure?

24:31.036 --> 24:32.094
lt's working.

24:32.170 --> 24:35.139
2,500 kilopascals and holding.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.174
Bridge to Janeway.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.300
We're being scanned
by the Array, Captain.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.276
lt's penetrated our shields.

24:40.345 --> 24:41.277
What kind of scan?

24:42.347 --> 24:43.314
Bridge?

24:43.381 --> 24:44.575
Janeway to Bridge.
Respond.

24:47.118 --> 24:48.983
lnitiate emergency lock off.

24:56.261 --> 24:59.162
You're not seriously hurt.
You can return to your station.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.865
This is the emergency
holographic doctor speaking.

25:11.943 --> 25:12.910
l gave no permission

25:12.978 --> 25:14.969
for anyone to be transported
out of Sick Bay.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.614
Hello.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.241
Sick Bay to Bridge.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.519
l believe someone has failed
to terminate my program.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.750
Please respond.

25:41.072 --> 25:42.903
Come up here.

25:42.974 --> 25:43.906
Come on now.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.806
l have a pitcher

25:45.977 --> 25:48.343
of lemonade
and some sugar cookies.

25:53.985 --> 25:54.974
Captain?

25:55.053 --> 25:56.816
Don't believe your eyes,
Mr. Paris.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.981
We've only transported
100 kilometers.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.355
We're inside the Array.

26:01.459 --> 26:03.893
There's no indication
of stable matter.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.727
All this must be some kind
of holographic projection.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.096
Oh, you poor things.
You must be tired out.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.431
But come on and sit down
and rest a while.

26:11.503 --> 26:12.697
Have a cold drink, hmm?

26:12.771 --> 26:14.261
No, thank you.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.534
My name is Kathryn Janeway,

26:16.608 --> 26:19.133
Captain of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.872
Now just make yourselves
right at home.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.345
The neighbors should
be here any minute.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.849
Oh. Why, here they are.

26:27.185 --> 26:28.152
Howdy.

26:28.219 --> 26:29.811
Welcome, folks.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.287
Hey.

26:31.356 --> 26:34.325
Well, good to see you.
Welcome.

26:34.392 --> 26:36.121
We're real glad you dropped by.

26:36.194 --> 26:37.923
Now we can get started.

26:37.996 --> 26:42.126
You're all invited
to the welcoming bee!

26:42.200 --> 26:43.929
Let's have some music!

26:49.975 --> 26:51.567
Yoo-hoo!

27:15.700 --> 27:18.533
The crew's scattered
around this farm, Captain,

27:18.603 --> 27:20.628
but they're all accounted for.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.832
Move around.
Scan the area.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.169
See if you can find anything

27:24.242 --> 27:26.142
that might be
a holographic generator.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.212
Have some nice fresh
corn on the cob.

27:30.281 --> 27:33.773
Fresh corn on the cob.

27:33.852 --> 27:37.288
Corn on the cob?
Corn on the cob?

27:37.355 --> 27:39.084
Can you tell me why we're here?

27:39.157 --> 27:41.125
Oh, we don't mean you any harm.

27:41.192 --> 27:43.660
l'm sorry if we've put you out.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.286
Why don't you just
put your feet up

27:45.363 --> 27:46.921
and get comfortable
while you wait?

27:47.032 --> 27:48.590
Wait for what?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.261
lsn't anybody hungry?

27:51.336 --> 27:53.566
Come on, now.
Make yourselves at home.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.902
l'm sorry if we've put you out.

28:07.919 --> 28:10.410
Hey, let me show you around.

28:10.488 --> 28:11.887
The root cellar's
right over there.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.017
What's down there?

28:14.092 --> 28:15.616
Potatoes, onions.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.389
But it's real private.

28:17.462 --> 28:18.759
Hmm.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.128
Paris, she's only a hologram.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.757
No reason to be rude.

28:23.968 --> 28:24.957
Whoa.

28:25.036 --> 28:25.968
What?

28:26.037 --> 28:27.504
Sporocystian life signs.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.312
What's in the barn?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.507
Oh, nothing
but a big ol' pile of hay.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.345
Hey, come on! Let's
go see the duck pond.

28:39.417 --> 28:40.349
Nothing in there.

28:40.418 --> 28:42.750
lt's just a dark, smelly barn.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.517
Hey, do y'all want
some deviled eggs?

28:45.590 --> 28:46.887
Huh?

28:52.163 --> 28:54.688
See? Nothing but hay.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.324
There's a life-form here.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.891
-Just one.
-Where?

28:57.969 --> 28:59.061
lt's everywhere.

29:00.238 --> 29:03.503
l'm also reading some kind
of matrix processing device.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.042
lt may be
the holographic generator.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.808
Paris.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.711
Humanoid life signs over here.

29:10.782 --> 29:14.809
l'm reading a Vulcan
and several humans.

29:14.886 --> 29:17.548
l'm not ready for you yet!

29:23.328 --> 29:24.454
Paris to Janeway.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.031
Janeway here.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.258
Paris?

29:29.801 --> 29:30.790
Come on.

29:50.955 --> 29:51.922
Very well.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.618
Since no one seems
to care for any corn,

29:54.692 --> 29:57.183
we'll have to proceed
ahead of schedule.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.411
Janeway to Bridge.
Anybody there?

31:30.488 --> 31:32.456
Yes, Captain, we're here.

31:32.523 --> 31:33.854
How long were we over there?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.092
Almost three days.

31:37.161 --> 31:38.389
Three days!

31:38.463 --> 31:42.297
Captain, the Maquis ship
is powering up its engines.

31:42.367 --> 31:43.994
Tractor them.
All senior officers report

31:44.102 --> 31:45.296
to the Bridge immediately.

31:45.370 --> 31:48.601
Excuse me, could you explain
what has transpired?

31:48.673 --> 31:50.140
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.267
Ensign Kim is not on board.

31:52.343 --> 31:54.174
Uh, Paris to Janeway.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.008
Go ahead.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.275
Kim didn't come back with us.
He must still be over there.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.316
Acknowledged.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.181
Computer, how many crewmen
are unaccounted for?

32:01.286 --> 32:03.151
One: Ensign Harry Kim.

32:03.187 --> 32:04.620
Hail the Maquis.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.747
Commander Chakotay,

32:07.825 --> 32:10.259
my name is
Captain Kathryn Janeway.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.727
How do you know my name?

32:11.796 --> 32:13.229
We were on a mission
to find you

32:13.298 --> 32:15.129
when we were brought here
by the Array.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.292
One of our crewmen is missing.

32:17.368 --> 32:20.132
Was he transported back
to your ship by accident?

32:20.204 --> 32:23.071
No. A member of our crew
is missing, too.

32:23.141 --> 32:25.769
B'Elanna Torres, my Engineer.

32:25.843 --> 32:28.607
Commander, you and l
have the same problem.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.669
l think it makes sense

32:29.747 --> 32:31.715
to try and solve it together,
don't you?

32:37.121 --> 32:39.681
Three of us will transport
to your ship.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.990
They're powering down
their engines

32:42.060 --> 32:43.049
dropping their shields.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.233
Watch out, Captain.
They're armed.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.303
Put down your weapons.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.965
You won't need those here.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.207
lt's good to have you back,
Mr. Tuvok.

33:02.847 --> 33:05.077
l must inform you
that l was assigned

33:05.149 --> 33:06.878
to infiltrate your crew, sir.

33:06.951 --> 33:09.249
l am Captain Janeway's
Chief of Security.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.051
Were you going to deliver us

33:13.124 --> 33:15.092
into their waiting hands,
Vulcan?

33:15.159 --> 33:18.219
My mission was
to accumulate information

33:18.296 --> 33:19.923
on Maquis activities

33:20.031 --> 33:22.829
and then deliver you
into their ''waiting hands.''

33:22.900 --> 33:23.832
That is correct.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.630
l see you had help.

33:25.703 --> 33:29.571
lt's good to see you, too,
Chakotay.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.234
At least the Vulcan was doing
his duty as a Starfleet officer,

33:32.310 --> 33:33.538
but you...

33:33.611 --> 33:35.340
you betrayed us for what?

33:35.413 --> 33:38.576
Freedom from prison?
Latinum?

33:38.649 --> 33:40.981
What was your price this time?!

33:41.052 --> 33:43.111
You are speaking
to a member of my crew.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.212
l expect you to treat him
with the same respect

33:45.289 --> 33:47.655
as you would have me
treat a member of yours.

33:52.663 --> 33:56.394
Now, we have a lot to accomplish
and l suggest we all concentrate

33:56.467 --> 33:59.732
on finding our people
and getting ourselves back home.

33:59.804 --> 34:00.828
Based on my initial

34:00.938 --> 34:03.771
reconnaissance, Captain
l am convinced we are dealing

34:03.808 --> 34:05.776
with a single entity
in the Array.

34:05.843 --> 34:08.141
l would suggest
he scanned our computers

34:08.212 --> 34:11.306
in order to select a comfortable
holographic environment.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.282
ln effect, a waiting room

34:13.351 --> 34:16.786
to pacify us prior
to biometric assessment.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.411
An examination?

34:18.489 --> 34:20.922
lt is the most
logical explanation.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.289
Why else would he have
released us unharmed?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.556
Not all of us were.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.831
Break out the compression
phaser rifles.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.562
Meet us in Transporter Room 2.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.627
We're going back.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.433
We'll divide into teams.

34:35.505 --> 34:37.974
Mr. Tuvok, while Chakotay
and l are looking for Torres

34:38.076 --> 34:39.771
and, Kim, your job
is to find out

34:39.844 --> 34:42.312
as much about this Array
as you can.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.312
lt brought us here.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.178
We have to assume
it can send us home.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.217
Agreed?

34:51.822 --> 34:54.485
Mr. Rollins, maintain Red Alert.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.618
Keep us on constant
transporter locks.

34:56.694 --> 34:57.661
Captain.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.292
l'd like to go with you.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.027
lf this has something
to do with what Chakotay...

35:04.102 --> 35:06.297
lt doesn't.
l just...

35:07.638 --> 35:10.129
l'd hate to see
anything happen to Harry.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.268
Come on.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.235
There are no humanoid
life-forms indicated, Captain.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.635
Kim and Torres are not
within tricorder range.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.196
They may not be on the Array.

35:43.274 --> 35:44.866
He can tell us where they are.

35:44.942 --> 35:46.671
Maintain your com link.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.871
l don't want
to lose anyone else.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.226
Oh, why have you come back?

36:03.294 --> 36:05.228
You don't have what l need.

36:05.396 --> 36:07.864
l don't know what you need
and, frankly, l don't care.

36:07.932 --> 36:09.331
l just want our people back

36:09.400 --> 36:11.265
and l want us all
to be sent home.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.133
Oh, well, now,
aren't you contentious

36:14.205 --> 36:16.969
for a minor bipedal species.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.234
This minor bipedal species

36:20.311 --> 36:22.336
doesn't take kindly
to being abducted.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.142
Oh, it was necessary.

36:24.215 --> 36:25.580
Where are our people?

36:25.650 --> 36:26.639
They are no longer here.

36:26.717 --> 36:28.116
What have you done to them?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.746
You don't have what l need.

36:30.821 --> 36:32.186
They might.

36:32.256 --> 36:33.621
No. You'll have to leave them.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.715
We won't do that.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.726
We are their commanding
officers.

36:36.794 --> 36:38.386
We are entrusted
with their safety.

36:38.462 --> 36:40.453
They are our responsibility.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.931
That may be a concept
you don't understand.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.367
Oh, no, l do understand,

36:46.437 --> 36:49.099
but l have no choice.

36:49.173 --> 36:51.869
Oh...

36:51.943 --> 36:54.935
There just is
not enough time left.

36:55.079 --> 36:56.671
Left for what?

36:56.747 --> 37:00.012
l must honor a debt
that can never be repaid,

37:00.084 --> 37:03.520
but my search has
not been going well.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.392
Tell us what you're looking for.

37:09.460 --> 37:11.189
Maybe we can help you find it.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.695
You?

37:14.465 --> 37:15.727
l've searched the galaxy

37:15.800 --> 37:17.825
with methods
beyond your comprehension.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.029
No. There's nothing you can do.

37:20.104 --> 37:23.835
You've taken us 70,000
light-years from our home.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.876
We have no way back
unless you send us

37:25.977 --> 37:27.911
and we won't leave
without the others.

37:27.979 --> 37:32.416
But... sending you back
is terribly complicated.

37:32.483 --> 37:33.916
Don't you understand?

37:33.985 --> 37:36.283
l don't have time.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.914
Not enough time!

38:07.952 --> 38:10.420
He's regaining consciousness.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.815
How do you feel?

38:15.293 --> 38:16.851
What am l doing here?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.053
Where am l?

38:18.129 --> 38:20.290
Please don't try to move yet.

38:20.364 --> 38:21.592
You're very ill.

38:21.666 --> 38:22.758
lll? No, no,
there's some mistake,

38:22.833 --> 38:23.891
l'm not...

38:34.345 --> 38:35.437
No!

39:21.158 --> 39:25.390
Captain's Log, Stardate 48315.6.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.863
We've traced the energy pulses
from the Array

39:27.932 --> 39:30.730
to the fifth planet
of the neighboring system

39:30.801 --> 39:32.701
and believe they may have
been used in some fashion

39:32.770 --> 39:36.365
to transport Kim and Torres
to the planet's surface.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.643
Come in.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.445
Captain, l've observed something
peculiar about the pulses.

39:48.519 --> 39:50.350
They're getting faster.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.323
Faster.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.086
The interval between each pulse

39:55.159 --> 39:57.787
has decreased by .47
seconds since we arrived.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.796
l can offer no explanation.

39:59.864 --> 40:02.697
That's only one of the mysteries
we're dealing with, Mr. Tuvok.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.462
Take a look at this.

40:08.105 --> 40:10.403
lt's virtually a desert.

40:10.474 --> 40:11.566
Not one ocean.

40:11.642 --> 40:12.802
Not one river.

40:12.877 --> 40:14.708
lt has all the basic
characteristics

40:14.779 --> 40:16.371
of an M-Class planet, except...

40:18.048 --> 40:19.913
there are no
nucleogenic particles

40:19.984 --> 40:20.951
in the atmosphere.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.781
That would mean
the planet is incapable

40:22.853 --> 40:23.785
of producing rain.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.481
l've studied thousands
of M-Class planets.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.990
l've never seen an atmosphere
without nucleogenics.

40:28.058 --> 40:29.082
There must have been

40:29.160 --> 40:32.357
some kind of extraordinary
environmental disaster.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.738
As soon as repairs
are complete...

40:45.176 --> 40:47.736
we'll set a course
for the fifth planet.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.481
Captain.

40:53.551 --> 40:55.849
You require sleep.

40:57.421 --> 41:00.083
Kim's mother called me
just after he left Earth.

41:00.157 --> 41:02.057
Delightful woman.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.094
He's her only son.

41:04.161 --> 41:07.153
He'd left his clarinet behind.

41:07.231 --> 41:10.928
She wanted to know if she
had time to send it.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.169
l had to tell her no.

41:16.273 --> 41:18.173
Do you know
he played the clarinet

41:18.242 --> 41:20.073
in the Juilliard Youth Symphony?

41:20.144 --> 41:23.238
l did not have the opportunity
to meet Mr. Kim.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.748
l barely knew him.

41:27.685 --> 41:30.711
l never seem to have the chance
to get to know any of them.

41:33.090 --> 41:35.251
l have to, um...

41:37.027 --> 41:39.655
l have to take more time
to do that.

41:41.765 --> 41:44.791
lt's a fine crew
and l've got to get them home.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.866
The crew will not benefit

41:48.939 --> 41:51.203
from the leadership
of an exhausted Captain.

41:54.044 --> 41:56.342
You're right as usual.

41:58.282 --> 41:59.909
l've missed your counsel, Tuvok.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.817
l am gratified
that you came after me

42:02.920 --> 42:04.581
so l can offer it once again.

42:04.622 --> 42:07.318
l spoke to your family
before l left.

42:07.391 --> 42:09.689
Are they well?

42:09.760 --> 42:12.251
Well, but worried about you.

42:12.329 --> 42:15.890
That would not be
an accurate perception, Captain.

42:15.966 --> 42:18.400
Vulcans do not worry.

42:18.469 --> 42:22.303
They... miss you.

42:24.008 --> 42:26.135
As l do them.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.316
l'll get you back to them.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.012
That's a promise, Tuvok.

42:49.099 --> 42:51.624
Captain's Log, supplemental.

42:51.702 --> 42:54.762
The Maquis ship and Voyager
have encountered a debris field

42:54.838 --> 42:56.965
where sensors have detected
a small vessel.

42:57.041 --> 42:59.566
One humanoid life-form
is on board.

42:59.643 --> 43:01.235
Hail them.

43:11.355 --> 43:15.587
Whoever you are, l found
this waste zone first.

43:15.659 --> 43:18.822
We're not interested
in this debris, Mister...?

43:18.896 --> 43:21.330
Neelix.

43:21.398 --> 43:25.926
And since you're not interested
in my ''debris''

43:26.003 --> 43:28.938
well, l'm delighted to know you.

43:29.006 --> 43:30.530
Captain Kathryn Janeway

43:30.608 --> 43:33.099
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

43:33.177 --> 43:34.940
A very impressive title.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.071
l have no idea what it means,

43:37.147 --> 43:38.978
but it sounds very impressive.

43:39.083 --> 43:43.281
Do you know this area
of space well, Mr. Neelix?

43:43.354 --> 43:46.255
l am famous for knowing it well.

43:46.323 --> 43:48.223
How may l be of service?

43:48.292 --> 43:50.157
Do you know anything
about the Array

43:50.227 --> 43:52.752
that's sending energy pulses
to the fifth planet?

43:52.830 --> 43:56.766
l know enough to stay
as far away from it as possible.

43:56.834 --> 44:00.395
Wait, let me guess.

44:00.471 --> 44:05.374
You were whisked away from
somewhere else in the galaxy

44:05.442 --> 44:07.842
and brought here
against your will.

44:07.911 --> 44:11.244
Sounds as though you've heard
this story before.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.512
Sadly, yes, thousands of times.

44:14.585 --> 44:16.416
Well, hundreds of times.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.580
Maybe 50 times.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.884
But the Caretaker

44:19.957 --> 44:22.926
has been bringing ships here
for months now.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.426
The Caretaker?

44:24.495 --> 44:28.022
That's what the Ocampa call him.

44:28.098 --> 44:30.931
They live on the fifth planet.

44:31.001 --> 44:34.801
Did he... kidnap members
of your crew?

44:34.872 --> 44:37.238
As a matter of fact, he did.

44:37.307 --> 44:39.639
lt's not the first time.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.701
Do you know where
he might have taken them?

44:41.779 --> 44:44.771
Just that they're brought
to the Ocampa.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.748
Nothing more.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.614
We'd appreciate any help
you could give us

44:48.686 --> 44:50.916
in finding these... Ocampa.

44:50.988 --> 44:54.981
l-l-l really wish
that l could help you, l do.

44:55.059 --> 44:56.253
But as you can see,

44:56.326 --> 44:58.954
there's just so much debris
for me to investigate today.

44:59.029 --> 45:04.057
You'd be surprised the things
of value some people abandon.

45:04.168 --> 45:06.864
Of course, we'd want to
compensate you for your trouble.

45:06.904 --> 45:11.170
Well, there's really very little
that you could offer me.

45:11.241 --> 45:14.210
Unless...

45:14.278 --> 45:15.745
Yes?

45:15.813 --> 45:18.145
Unless, of course,

45:18.215 --> 45:20.206
you had...

45:20.284 --> 45:22.514
...water?

45:25.456 --> 45:28.220
lf you help us find
our missing crew members,

45:28.292 --> 45:30.886
you can have
all the water you want.

45:32.830 --> 45:36.664
Well, tha-that sounds like
a very reasonable arrangement.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.065
Good. We'll beam you over

45:38.135 --> 45:39.830
and tow your ship
into our shuttlebay.

45:39.903 --> 45:43.395
Mr. Tuvok, go to Transporter
Room 2 and meet our guest.

45:43.474 --> 45:46.034
Beam?

45:46.110 --> 45:47.407
We have a technology

45:47.478 --> 45:50.379
which can take you instantly
from your ship to ours.

45:50.447 --> 45:52.176
lt's quite harmless.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.511
May we?

45:59.923 --> 46:01.049
Energize.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.567
Astonishing!

46:14.638 --> 46:15.570
You Federations

46:15.639 --> 46:18.267
are obviously
an advanced culture.

46:18.342 --> 46:21.038
The Federation is made up
of many cultures.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.079
l am Vulcan.

46:23.147 --> 46:24.739
Neelix.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.615
Good to meet you.

46:28.685 --> 46:31.449
lnteresting.

46:31.522 --> 46:35.356
What... what exactly...

46:37.461 --> 46:40.157
What exactly does all this...

46:40.230 --> 46:41.697
all this do?

46:41.765 --> 46:43.596
l assure you
that everything in this room

46:43.667 --> 46:45.862
has a specific function.

46:45.936 --> 46:49.463
However, it would take
several hours to explain it all.

46:49.540 --> 46:52.202
l suggest we proceed
to your quarters.

46:52.276 --> 46:53.971
Oh.

46:55.078 --> 46:57.137
Perhaps you would care
for a bath.

46:57.214 --> 46:58.909
A what?

46:58.982 --> 47:00.882
Hmm...

47:17.100 --> 47:19.534
lt's okay.
lt's okay.

47:19.603 --> 47:20.627
Who are you?

47:20.704 --> 47:23.537
My name is Kim-- Harry Kim.

47:23.607 --> 47:25.131
l'm an Ensign
on the Starship Voyager.

47:25.209 --> 47:27.871
l was kidnapped from the Array
just like you were.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.103
l don't know where we are.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.010
What was Starfleet doing
at that Array?

47:31.081 --> 47:33.311
We were looking for you,
actually.

47:33.383 --> 47:35.351
One minute, we're, we're
in the Badlands, the next...

47:35.419 --> 47:37.546
You mean, you were
trying to capture us.

47:37.621 --> 47:40.055
Yeah... consider
yourself captured.

47:40.123 --> 47:41.784
Oh, l know l have
a phaser here somewhere.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.828
l don't find this
at all amusing, Starfleet.

47:47.731 --> 47:49.289
There's no point.

47:49.366 --> 47:51.391
lt's locked.

47:52.903 --> 47:53.927
Hey!

47:54.004 --> 47:55.733
Hey, hey, hey what's that
going to accomplish?

47:55.806 --> 47:57.034
What are they doing to us?!

47:57.107 --> 47:58.540
What are these things
growing on us?!

47:58.609 --> 48:00.543
Look, do you want them
to sedate you again?

48:04.081 --> 48:06.481
You're right, Starfleet.

48:12.422 --> 48:14.515
lt's the Klingon half of me.

48:14.591 --> 48:17.719
lt's just, it's hard
to control it sometimes.

48:24.835 --> 48:26.393
What's your name, Maquis?

48:32.809 --> 48:34.572
B'Elanna.

48:34.645 --> 48:36.875
B'Elanna Torres.

48:38.949 --> 48:41.440
l hope you're feeling better.

48:41.518 --> 48:44.681
l know how frightening all this
must be for both of you.

48:44.755 --> 48:48.350
l've brought some clothes
if you care to change.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.416
Why are you holding us here?

48:50.494 --> 48:52.052
You are not prisoners.

48:52.129 --> 48:55.064
ln fact,
we consider you honored guests.

48:56.633 --> 48:59.363
The Caretaker
has sent you to us.

48:59.436 --> 49:00.460
As long as you are not violent

49:00.570 --> 49:01.832
you are free
to leave your quarters.

49:01.905 --> 49:04.066
What's wrong with us?

49:04.141 --> 49:06.268
What are these things?

49:06.343 --> 49:08.811
We really don't know.

49:11.014 --> 49:12.572
You must be hungry.

49:12.649 --> 49:15.550
Would you care to join me
on the courtyard for a meal?

49:19.256 --> 49:21.622
Our food dispensers
are right this way.

49:25.495 --> 49:27.395
We're underground.

49:27.464 --> 49:30.160
Our society is subterranean.

49:30.233 --> 49:34.169
We've lived here
for over 500 generations.

49:34.237 --> 49:36.364
But before that,
you lived on the surface?

49:36.440 --> 49:38.203
Until the warming began.

49:38.275 --> 49:39.242
The warming?

49:39.309 --> 49:41.402
When our surface
turned into a desert

49:41.478 --> 49:44.003
and the Caretaker
came to protect us.

49:44.081 --> 49:47.050
Our ancient journals
tell us he opened

49:47.117 --> 49:48.744
a deep chasm in the ground

49:48.819 --> 49:51.219
and led our ancestors
to this place.

49:51.288 --> 49:54.815
Since then, he has provided
for all our needs.

49:59.629 --> 50:01.859
Oh, please forgive them.

50:01.932 --> 50:03.832
They know you've come
from the Caretaker.

50:03.900 --> 50:06.562
None of us has ever seen him.

50:06.636 --> 50:08.661
This way, please.

50:21.918 --> 50:24.352
Does the Caretaker
provide your meals, too?

50:24.421 --> 50:25.445
ln fact, he does.

50:25.522 --> 50:26.784
He designed

50:26.857 --> 50:29.655
and built this entire city
for us after the warming.

50:29.726 --> 50:32.524
The food processors dispense
nutritional supplements

50:32.596 --> 50:34.564
every 4.1 intervals.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.000
lt may not offer
the exotic tastes

50:39.069 --> 50:41.196
some of our younger people
crave these days,

50:41.271 --> 50:42.795
but it meets our needs.

50:46.943 --> 50:49.434
ls this how the Caretaker
communicates with you?

50:49.513 --> 50:51.708
He never communicates directly.

50:51.782 --> 50:54.842
We try to interpret his wishes
as best we can.

50:54.918 --> 50:56.943
l'm curious to know
how you've interpreted

50:57.020 --> 50:59.147
the Caretaker's reason
for sending us here.

50:59.222 --> 51:01.190
We believe he must
have separated you

51:01.291 --> 51:03.725
from your own species
for their protection.

51:03.760 --> 51:04.954
Their protection?

51:06.263 --> 51:07.457
From your illness.

51:08.765 --> 51:10.790
Perhaps he's trying
to prevent a plague.

51:10.867 --> 51:13.233
We weren't sick
until we met your Caretaker.

51:13.303 --> 51:16.329
From time to time,
he asks us to care for people

51:16.406 --> 51:17.498
with this disease.

51:17.574 --> 51:18.700
lt's the least we can do.

51:18.775 --> 51:21.642
There have been others--
like us?

51:21.711 --> 51:23.679
Yes.

51:23.747 --> 51:25.578
Where are they?

51:27.884 --> 51:30.250
Your condition is serious.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.982
We don't know exactly
how to treat it.

51:33.056 --> 51:36.219
l'm afraid the others
did not recover.

52:29.746 --> 52:30.713
Sir...

52:30.780 --> 52:33.977
Ah, Mr. Vulcan.
Come in, come in.

52:34.050 --> 52:35.745
Please, l can hardly see you.

52:35.819 --> 52:39.482
l want to thank you
for your hospitality.

52:39.556 --> 52:42.548
l must admit,
l haven't had access

52:42.626 --> 52:45.094
to a food replor...
uh, replicator before.

52:46.229 --> 52:48.561
l'd never have guessed.

52:48.632 --> 52:50.156
And to immerse myself
in water...

52:50.233 --> 52:52.895
oh, do you know
what joy this is?

52:55.739 --> 52:58.435
No one around here
wastes water in this manner.

52:58.508 --> 52:59.998
A good sand scrub--

53:00.043 --> 53:01.601
that's the best
that we can hope for.

53:05.382 --> 53:07.612
l'm pleased
you're enjoying yourself,

53:07.684 --> 53:09.515
but we're in orbit
of the fifth planet.

53:09.586 --> 53:10.917
We need your assistance.

53:10.987 --> 53:14.013
Oh, uh, could you hand
me the, uh... towel?

53:20.096 --> 53:23.623
lf you will scan
the large southern continent,

53:23.700 --> 53:25.691
you'll find a range
of extinct volcanoes.

53:25.769 --> 53:27.532
Follow the foothills north

53:27.604 --> 53:29.538
until you discover
a dry river bed.

53:29.606 --> 53:31.938
You'll find an encampment there.

53:32.008 --> 53:34.374
Do you believe our people
might be at this location?

53:34.444 --> 53:37.845
lt's not impossible...
maybe...

53:39.216 --> 53:42.151
Perhaps not,
but we'll find them.

53:42.219 --> 53:45.711
We'll need several containers
of water to bring for barter.

53:45.789 --> 53:51.659
Do these, uh, replicators
make clothing, as well?

53:51.728 --> 53:53.161
Yes.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.926
Will it make me
a uniform like yours?

53:55.999 --> 53:57.296
No...

53:57.367 --> 53:59.164
it most certainly will not.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.328
Hmm.

54:27.631 --> 54:30.293
Why would anyone want
to live in a place like this?

54:30.367 --> 54:34.167
The rich cormaline deposits
are very much in demand.

54:34.237 --> 54:35.898
The Ocampa use it for barter?

54:35.972 --> 54:39.305
Not the Ocampa, the Kazon-Ogla.

54:39.376 --> 54:41.810
The Kazon-Ogla?
Who are the Kazon-Ogla?

54:41.878 --> 54:43.072
They are.

54:43.146 --> 54:45.671
Kazon sects control
this part of the Quadrant.

54:45.749 --> 54:48.309
Some have food, some have ore,
some have water.

54:48.385 --> 54:50.285
They all trade, and they all
kill each other for it.

54:50.353 --> 54:52.378
l thought you said the Ocampa
had our people.

54:52.455 --> 54:54.719
My friends!
lt's good to see you again!

54:54.791 --> 54:56.053
Whoo!

54:59.429 --> 55:02.956
l must speak with your maje,
the ever-wise Jabin.

55:05.969 --> 55:08.199
Ah. Very amusing.

55:08.271 --> 55:09.795
Very amusing.

55:09.873 --> 55:11.670
l, uh...

55:11.741 --> 55:13.732
l enjoy a joke
as much as the next man.

55:15.445 --> 55:16.742
Jabin!

55:16.813 --> 55:17.745
My old friend!

55:21.051 --> 55:22.916
Water... water, Jabin.

55:22.986 --> 55:26.547
l have water... to replace
all that l borrowed.

55:26.623 --> 55:28.250
Show them, Mr. Paris.

55:28.325 --> 55:32.227
Their ship has technology that
makes water out of thin air!

55:41.371 --> 55:42.668
You have more?

55:42.739 --> 55:46.231
Janeway to Voyager.
Energize.

55:51.147 --> 55:52.273
Oh!

55:58.321 --> 56:01.313
There's more where that came
from if you can help us.

56:01.424 --> 56:03.517
How can we help someone
so powerful

56:03.560 --> 56:05.289
they can create water
out of thin air?

56:05.362 --> 56:07.489
This man led us here

56:07.564 --> 56:10.727
suggesting we might find
a people called the Ocampa.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.267
Do you know where they are?

56:12.435 --> 56:14.164
Ocampa?

56:15.772 --> 56:17.069
She is Ocampa.

56:17.140 --> 56:20.541
Why would you be interested
in such worthless creatures?

56:20.610 --> 56:22.043
They live only nine years.

56:22.112 --> 56:24.239
They make poor servants.

56:24.314 --> 56:26.214
We caught her when she wandered
to the surface.

56:26.282 --> 56:27.249
To the surface?

56:27.317 --> 56:29.285
You mean, they live underground?

56:29.352 --> 56:30.478
The entity in space

56:30.553 --> 56:32.748
that gives them food and power,
also gives them

56:32.822 --> 56:35.188
sole access to the only
water on this world--

56:35.258 --> 56:36.782
two miles below the surface.

56:36.860 --> 56:40.261
This same entity has abducted
two of our people.

56:40.330 --> 56:42.628
We believe they might be
with the Ocampa.

56:42.699 --> 56:46.226
There's no way to get to them.
We tried.

56:46.302 --> 56:47.701
The entity has established

56:47.771 --> 56:49.102
some kind
of subterranean barrier

56:49.172 --> 56:50.867
we cannot penetrate.

56:50.940 --> 56:52.305
But she got out.

56:52.375 --> 56:55.708
Occasionally, some of them do
find their way to the surface--

56:55.779 --> 56:57.371
we don't know how--

56:57.447 --> 56:59.642
but the Ocampa seal
the tunnels afterwards.

56:59.716 --> 57:02.981
Maybe she can help these
good people find a way down.

57:04.287 --> 57:07.085
You'd be wasting your time.

57:07.157 --> 57:08.215
l've used every method

57:08.291 --> 57:10.122
of persuasion l know
to get her to help us.

57:10.193 --> 57:11.956
She won't!

57:12.028 --> 57:13.552
Then she's worthless to you.

57:13.630 --> 57:17.999
Let us trade you water
for this scrawny little thing.

57:19.536 --> 57:23.267
l'd be more interested
in acquiring this technology

57:23.339 --> 57:26.069
that allows you to create water
from thin air.

57:26.142 --> 57:27.541
That would be difficult.

57:27.610 --> 57:30.511
lt's integrated
into our ship's systems.

57:31.548 --> 57:32.640
Tell them to drop their weapons!

57:33.950 --> 57:36.418
Drop them, my friends,
or he dies in an instant.

57:36.486 --> 57:40.684
Do it!
Do it!

57:46.996 --> 57:48.156
Step aside.

57:54.637 --> 57:55.501
Come on!

57:57.640 --> 57:59.801
l strongly suggest
you get us out of here.

57:59.876 --> 58:01.070
Six to beam up.

58:12.288 --> 58:16.088
My dearest, didn't l promise
l'd save you?

58:31.674 --> 58:33.198
Look, l'm sure Captain Janeway

58:33.276 --> 58:35.437
is doing everything
she can to find us.

58:35.512 --> 58:38.072
What makes you think
any of them are still alive?

58:40.683 --> 58:42.651
Should l call for some help?

58:42.719 --> 58:44.084
No.

59:00.303 --> 59:01.930
Are you in pain?

59:02.005 --> 59:03.529
Are you watching us?

59:03.606 --> 59:05.301
l thought we weren't supposed
to be your prisoners.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.309
l wasn't watching you.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.776
l was coming
to give you something.

59:08.845 --> 59:10.039
l don't know if it will help.

59:10.113 --> 59:11.705
lt's a medicine.

59:11.781 --> 59:13.180
There are people
who have broken

59:13.249 --> 59:14.807
from tradition
and left the city.

59:14.951 --> 59:17.249
Their colony
grows fruits and vegetables.

59:17.320 --> 59:19.788
They discovered quite by
accident that the moss

59:19.856 --> 59:21.414
that grows on
certain fruit trees

59:21.491 --> 59:22.583
has healing properties.

59:22.659 --> 59:25.526
l'm sorry for what
has happened to you.

59:25.595 --> 59:27.222
We appreciate this,

59:27.297 --> 59:28.559
but the only way
we're going to survive

59:28.631 --> 59:31.759
is if we can get to the surface
and find our own people.

59:31.834 --> 59:35.167
The elders would say that's
against the Caretaker's wishes.

59:35.238 --> 59:36.671
What do you say?

59:37.874 --> 59:39.842
The Caretaker's
been behaving strangely

59:39.909 --> 59:41.376
for the past several months--

59:41.444 --> 59:44.641
abducting people,
increasing the power supply.

59:44.714 --> 59:45.874
Power supply?

59:45.949 --> 59:48.042
He's tripled the energy
he sends us.

59:48.117 --> 59:49.914
They say we have
enough stored now

59:49.986 --> 59:51.613
to run the city for five years.

59:51.688 --> 59:53.485
And nobody knows why?

59:53.556 --> 59:58.584
When we ask, we're told to trust
the Caretaker's decisions.

59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.925
One person l knew
did get to the surface.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.930
We never saw her again.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:03.931
How?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.864
The ancient tunnels

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.925
that brought us here
still exist.

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:09.471
Over the years, small breaches
in security barriers

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:10.801
have appeared,
just large enough

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:13.273
for someone to get through,
but it still requires

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.402
digging through meters
of rock to get out.

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:17.946
Can you get us tools
to dig with?

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:21.711
lt would take days, maybe
even weeks to break through.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.979
You have to rest.

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.315
Conserve your strength.

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:27.982
Please... it's our only chance.

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.429
lf you had told us
what you had planned,

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.995
we might have anticipated
your irrational behavior.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.337
lrrational?
We got out of there, didn't we?

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.341
Excuse me.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.707
Don't blame Neelix...

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:49.938
That's enough.

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:52.379
This is a Sick Bay,
not a conference room.

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:53.813
Visiting hours are over.

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:57.375
Everyone, except my patient,
is to leave immediately.

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:00.013
Computer, end medical
holographic program.

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.857
l never should have
gone to the surface.

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.917
l'm too curious.

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.929
l'm told it's my worst failing.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.931
No, no.
lt's a wonderful quality--

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.489
your most endearing.

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:14.364
Would you be willing
to take us underground

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:15.597
to look for our missing crew?

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.038
l'm afraid Jabin was right.

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.506
There's no way to get down.

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:21.338
The tunnel l came out
has been sealed.

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:22.742
We don't need a tunnel.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.939
We have the ability
to transport there directly.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:28.983
Captain, our sensors did not
pick up any indication

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.849
of an underground civilization.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.911
The subterranean barrier
Jabin described

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.081
may be responsible.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.557
lt might also block
our transporter.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.287
There are breaches

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.524
in the security barrier
where it's begun to decay.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.962
That's how l got out.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.425
Have the transporter room
begin a sweep

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.868
for any breaches we might
be able to beam through.

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.338
Kes can tell you where to go,

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.500
but, now that she's free,

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.271
we're leaving
this system together.

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.938
Neelix, these people rescued me.

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:59.777
l rescued you.

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.316
With their help.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:04.648
lt would be wrong
not to help them now.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:22.870
Captain, the pulses
from the Array

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:23.906
continue to accelerate.

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:25.531
The intervals between them
have decreased

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.098
another .8 seconds.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.087
Kes.

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.088
Hello, Daggin.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.715
We thought we'd never
see you again.

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.384
How did you get back?

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.985
These people rescued me
from the Kazon.

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:49.623
l'm trying to help them
find two of their crewmen.

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:52.634
Does anyone know where
the aliens are kept-- the ones

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.260
the Caretaker sends here?

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.599
l think they're
at the Central Clinic.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.195
Can you take us there?

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.537
No, she cannot.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.338
They can't speak
telepathically, Toscat.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:04.106
Please talk aloud.

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.581
l didn't mean to be rude,

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.241
but you should not be here.

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:11.150
We'll be glad to leave
once we find our crewmen.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.244
That won't be possible.

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:14.414
We cannot interfere
with the Caretaker's wishes.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.685
Maybe you can't, but we can.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.021
You don't understand.

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.152
That's right.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:20.661
They don't understand.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.924
They have no way of knowing

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.692
that the Ocampa
have been dependent

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:25.097
on the Caretaker for so long

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:27.728
that we can't even think
for ourselves anymore.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.170
They don't understand
we were once a people

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:33.140
who had full command
of our minds' abilities.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:36.110
The stories of our ancestors'
cognitive abilities

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.203
are apocryphal--

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.646
at the very least exaggerated.

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:42.650
We lost those abilities
because we stopped using them.

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:45.186
We should not dwell
on what's been lost,

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.846
but on all that's been gained.

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:48.982
We've gained a talent
for dependence,

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:51.184
for simply taking
what we're given.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.524
l'm going to help them, Toscat,
whether you like it or not,

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:56.258
and l think my friends
will join me.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:03.497
You defied the Caretaker
by going to the surface, Kes.

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:06.599
Learn from the experience.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.610
Follow the path
he has set for us.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.839
l've learned very well, Toscat.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:13.074
l saw the sunlight.

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.878
l can't believe
that our Caretaker

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.010
would forbid us
to open our eyes

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:18.883
and see the sky.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.355
Come with me--
we'll find your people.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:43.904
Come on.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.856
Don't let it beat you,
Starfleet. Come on.

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:02.931
l'm sorry.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:10.032
All right.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.839
lt's all right.
We'll rest a minute.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.846
Maybe l'd do better if l had
a little Klingon blood in me.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:22.112
Trust me-- it's more trouble
than it's worth.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:25.051
You know, l spent my whole life
getting ready for Starfleet,

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:28.921
and on my very first mission,

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:31.789
l'm going to die.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.421
We're not finished yet.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:39.124
l know a few things
that old Sneezy didn't teach

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.190
in his survival course.

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.201
Sneezy?

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.363
Commander Zakarian.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.371
Remember?

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.671
He must have been
allergic to everything.

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.108
You went to the Academy.

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:52.636
l actually made it into the
second year before we, uh...

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.741
we mutually agreed
that it wasn't the place for me.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:56.785
You know

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:59.252
l never really liked Zakarian.

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.857
Shh. Listen.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.289
They're getting faster.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.171
Away team to Voyager.

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.175
Voyager here.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.836
What's going on with the Array?

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.381
lt's no longer
sending out pulses, Captain,

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.974
and it appears to be
realigning its position.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:31.042
Keep me informed.
Janeway out.

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.721
They haven't been
at the clinic for hours.

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.556
We can search the city.
Ask if anyone's seen them.

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:42.119
lf they were trying to get to
the surface, how would they go?

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:45.065
Probably the same way l did--
up one of the ancient tunnels.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.863
Mr. Paris,
you and Neelix go with her

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.234
and start checking them out.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:53.041
We need to talk to every doctor
and nurse at this hospital

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.974
see what they can tell us
about Torres and Kim.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.138
Voyager to Janeway.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.180
Go ahead.

01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.271
Captain, the Array

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.543
is firing some kind of weapon
at the surface.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.881
lt seems to be trying to seal
the energy conduits.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.149
Understood.
Keep a channel open.

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.485
lf the Array is the Ocampa's
sole source of energy,

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.424
why would the Caretaker
seal the conduits?

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.427
He would seal them

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:14.690
if he no longer
intended to use them

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:16.789
to protect the Ocampa
from their enemies.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.231
Captain, there is
now enough evidence

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.029
to form a reasonable
hypothesis.

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:21.967
l believe that
the Caretaker is dying.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.096
Explain.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.367
First, he increases
the energy supply

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.068
to provide the city
with a surplus

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:29.976
to last at least five years,
then he seals the conduits.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.037
The logical conclusion is
that he does not intend

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.014
to continue his role
as Caretaker.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.573
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's dying.

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.675
He could be leaving.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.549
Doubtful.

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:41.021
Not after a millennium
of providing for these people.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.253
l believe that the Caretaker
owes something to the Ocampa.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:45.918
l believe the ''debt
that can never be repaid''

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:48.293
is very likely a debt to them.

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:50.559
ln addition, there were
his frequent references

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:52.191
to ''running out of time.''

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.736
l think he knew
his death was imminent.

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:58.934
lf he dies, how the hell
are we supposed to get home?

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.341
They're in this one.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.282
Harry?!

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.380
Paris to Janeway.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:14.445
Go ahead.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.514
They're in one
of the tunnels, Captain.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:19.060
l can't see them,
but they're up there.

01:08:19.127 --> 01:08:20.595
We're going after them.

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:22.858
Call for transport
when you have them, Paris.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.296
We'll meet you on the ship.

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:26.265
Janeway to Voyager.

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:27.267
Voyager here.

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:28.303
Three to beam up.

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.564
Stand by.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.331
Captain,
l can't get a lock on you.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:35.104
The weapons fire from the Array

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:36.872
has irradiated
the planet's crust.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.073
The transport sensors
can't find the breaches

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.341
in the security barrier.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.816
Come on, there's only one
other way out of here.

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.049
Janeway to Paris.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.283
Go ahead.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.348
The transporters aren't working.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.656
You're going to have to find
a breach in the security barrier

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.024
when you get to the top.

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:56.631
Understood.

01:08:56.698 --> 01:08:58.189
We're a few minutes behind you.

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.234
Janeway out.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.631
l see them.

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.648
Took you long enough.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.518
How could l let down
the only friend l got?

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.023
Friend? What makes
you think l'm your friend?

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.118
Paris to Janeway.

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.127
Go ahead.

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.129
We found them, Captain.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.256
Don't wait for us.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.299
Get them to safety.

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:37.404
Don't worry.

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.566
l know where we can
get through the barrier.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.314
Whatever you do, don't touch it.

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:52.354
We've been told
it'll burn your skin off.

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:08.535
They're not far ahead of us.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.628
Keep going.

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:29.317
l think we've reached the top.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.588
Neelix, get out your phaser.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.230
Voyager, can you get
a lock on us now?

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.823
Affirmative, but l'm reading
only five signals.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.390
The others are...

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.867
Get down!

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.373
Paris to Janeway.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:04.884
Chakotay, Tuvok, do you read?

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.654
Voyager, prepare to transport

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.020
everyone in this group
except me.

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:10.149
Aye, sir.

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:11.658
You're not thinking
of going back there.

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.455
Well...

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.263
the fool needs company.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:21.701
Take care of them, dearest.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.101
l'll see you later.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.732
Voyager, make that
three to beam up.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:29.244
Lock in on the other combadge
and energize.

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:40.311
My leg is broken.

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.289
l can't move.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.757
-Hold on.
-Here they are!

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.589
Neelix, help me with Tuvok.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.997
l'll get Chakotay.

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:07.048
Get out of here, Paris,

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.879
before the whole thing
comes down!

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.712
l intend to...

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.048
as soon as l get you up.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.521
You get on those stairs,
they'll collapse.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.387
We'll both die.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.016
Yeah...

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:19.492
but on the other hand,

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:22.121
if l save your butt,
your life belongs to me.

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:34.302
lsn't that some kind
of lndian custom?

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:37.343
Wrong tribe.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.516
l don't believe you.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:49.490
You'd rather die than let me
be the one to rescue you.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.758
Fine. Be a fool.

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:55.592
lf l have to die,

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:58.064
at least l'll have the pleasure
of watching you go with me.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.970
lsn't there some lndian trick

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.235
where you can turn
yourself into a bird

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:09.368
and fly us out of here?

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.242
You're too heavy.

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.265
Bridge to Janeway.

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:36.395
Go ahead.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.736
Captain, two Kazon ships
are approaching the Array.

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.570
Set a course.
l'm on my way.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.041
We've got to get back
to our ship.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:45.375
l strongly advise you to rest.

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:47.574
l will not be held responsible
for the consequences.

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.981
ls the crew always
this difficult?

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:50.984
l don't know, Doc.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.145
lt's my first mission.

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:59.190
Doesn't anyone know how
to turn off the program

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.159
when they leave?

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.862
Bring the weapons systems
on line.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.958
Powering up phaser banks
and photon systems.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.296
Red Alert.

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.083
The lead Kazon ship
is hailing us, Captain.

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:30.454
On screen.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:32.221
Have you come to investigate

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.524
the Entity's strange behavior
too, Captain?

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.928
All we care about
is getting home, Jabin.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:38.830
We're about to transport
over to the Array

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:40.129
to see if we can arrange it.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.931
l'm afraid l cannot permit that.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.301
We have no dispute with you.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.136
l have a dispute with anyone
who would challenge us.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.937
This is ridiculous.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.874
We have no intention
of challenging you.

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.913
And l have no intention
of letting anyone

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.175
with your technological
knowledge board the Array.

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:57.741
Jabin, can we discuss this
like two civilized...?

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:59.810
They're powering up
their weapons.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.185
l guess we can't.

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:05.355
Shields are holding.

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:09.959
Fire phasers.
Evasive pattern delta four.

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:26.438
Janeway to Chakotay.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:28.244
Tuvok and l
are beaming to the Array.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:30.046
Can you hold off the Kazon?

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:31.551
l think so, Captain.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.882
Good.

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:36.152
Mr. Paris, take the conn.

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.020
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.493
Maintain transporter locks,
Ensign.

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:41.494
Emergency beam out status.

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:42.530
Aye, Captain.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:59.012
The data processing system
is behind this wall, Captain.

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.217
You know what to do.

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:31.168
Well... you're, you're nothing
if not persistent.

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:34.215
We need you to send us back
where we came from.

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:37.376
Oh... that isn't possible.

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:41.912
l have... barely enough strength
to complete my work.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:47.454
You're sealing the conduits
before you die.

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:52.125
lf l don't, the Kazon
will steal the water.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.135
But, in a few years,

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:58.798
when the Ocampa's energy
runs out, it won't matter.

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:01.308
They'll be forced
to come to the surface

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.844
and they won't be able
to survive.

01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:07.178
Something you did turned
their planet into a desert,

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.273
didn't it?

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.046
That was the debt
that could never be repaid.

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:16.682
Well, we're explorers
from another galaxy,

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:20.023
but we had no idea
that our technology

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:23.792
would be so destructive
to their atmosphere.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.457
Two, two of us

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:29.163
were chosen to stay
behind and care for them.

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.898
There's another like you here?

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.533
Not anymore.

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:36.372
No, no. She...

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:39.471
she went off to look
for more interesting places.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.345
Why were you bringing
ships here--

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.714
infecting people
with a fatal illness?

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:44.752
Oh, they...

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.880
they didn't die of an illness.

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:54.121
They died
because they were incompatible.

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.026
''lncompatible''?

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.727
l've been searching the galaxy

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:04.204
for a compatible
biomolecular pattern.

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:06.103
Now, in some individuals,

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:09.804
l found cellular structures
that were similar, but l...

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.778
You've been trying to procreate?

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:14.975
l needed someone to replace me--

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.677
someone who'd understand

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:22.384
the enormous responsibility
of... caring for the Ocampa.

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:25.722
Only my offspring could do that.

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:35.364
Did you ever consider
allowing the Ocampa

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.200
to care for themselves?

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.702
They're children.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.676
Children have to grow up.

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:45.406
We're explorers, too.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.879
Most of the species
we've encountered

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.711
have overcome all kinds
of adversity

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.274
without a Caretaker.

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.718
lt's the challenge
of surviving on their own

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.653
that helps them to evolve.

01:19:54.723 --> 01:20:00.559
Maybe your... children
will do better than you think.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.527
Voyager to Janeway.

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:04.565
Go ahead.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.861
We've got problems here.

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:17.609
Kazon just got some backup.

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.271
We need more time.

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:21.542
Can you hold them off
for another few minutes?

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:23.413
We'll do our best.
Kim out.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.746
Their weapons array
has been hit.

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:28.915
They're in trouble.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:32.824
Neither of us has enough
firepower to stop that ship.

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.259
l'm setting a collision course,

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:36.524
but the guidance
system is disabled.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:38.759
l'll have to pilot
the ship manually.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.802
Get the crew ready
to beam to Voyager

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.564
and drop shields for transport.

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:46.372
Paris, my crew is coming over.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:49.501
Tell one of your crackerjack
Starfleet transporter chiefs

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:50.875
to keep a lock on me.

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:53.176
l'm going to try and take
some heat off your tail.

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.715
Acknowledged.

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:57.547
But don't think for a second
this makes us even, Chakotay.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.519
Your life is still mine.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.317
Paris out.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.188
l'm holding a lock on him, sir,

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:10.925
but he's getting too close.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.627
l'm getting you out
of there, Chakotay.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:14.691
Not yet!

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.336
You're breaking up!

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:21.568
Stand by to transport.

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.201
Wait!

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.012
Now!

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:42.456
Transporter Room 2,
do you have him?

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:43.895
They've got me.

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:56.102
Captain, l can access the system

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:57.804
to send us back
to Federation space,

01:21:57.879 --> 01:22:00.074
but it will take
several hours to activate.

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.044
Unless you help us.

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.177
Oh, l wish l could,

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:08.017
but l have
very little time left.

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:11.923
So l have initiated
a self-destruct program.

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:15.053
lf you destroy the Array,
we'll have no way to get home.

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.064
The Ocampa's enemies
cannot be allowed

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:20.033
to, to control
this installation.

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:23.593
ln minutes,
it will be destroyed.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.503
You have to go.

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.404
Go now!

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:54.257
The Caretaker.

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.501
Voyager, report.

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.438
A Kazon vessel

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:02.874
just collided
with the Array, Captain.

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.708
Are you all right?

01:23:04.779 --> 01:23:05.871
Affirmative.

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.539
Stand by.

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:10.675
The self-destruct program
has been damaged.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:14.210
Now, this installation
will not be destroyed.

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.517
But it must be.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:20.357
The Kazon must not be allowed
to gain control of it.

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:23.556
They will annihilate the Ocampa.

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:49.555
Shall l activate
the program to get us back?

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:53.185
And what happens to the Ocampa
after we're gone?

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:01.859
Captain, any action we take
to protect the Ocampa

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.996
would affect the balance
of power in this system.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.874
The Prime Directive
would seem to apply.

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.467
Would it?

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.975
We never asked to be involved,
Tuvok...

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.579
but we are.

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:24.120
We are.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.565
Mr. Tuvok, ready
the tricobalt devices.

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:34.260
Aye, Captain.

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:35.734
Open a channel to the Kazon.

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:36.930
Channel open.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.472
Be advised, Captain.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.440
l have called
for additional ships.

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:43.944
l'm calling to warn you to move
your vessels to a safe distance.

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.310
l intend to destroy the Array.

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:47.814
You can't do that.

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.850
l can and l will.

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:51.579
End transmission.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.752
They're increasing fire,
Captain.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:55.949
Shields are holding.

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.322
Move us 400 kilometers
from the Array, Mr. Paris.

01:24:58.393 --> 01:24:59.985
Yes, ma'am.

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.188
What do you think you're doing?

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:03.561
That Array is the only way
we have to get back home.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.565
l'm aware everyone has
families and loved ones

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.123
at homes they want
to get back to--

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:10.171
so do l-- but l'm not
willing to trade the lives

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.297
of the Ocampa
for our convenience.

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:13.863
We'll have to find
another way home.

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:15.636
What other way home is there?

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.804
Who is she to be making
these decisions for all of us?

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.575
She's the Captain.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.484
The tricobalt devices are ready.

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.611
We're in position.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.755
Fire.

01:25:57.919 --> 01:26:00.786
The lead Kazon ship
is hailing us.

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.789
On screen.

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:06.689
You have made an enemy today.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.525
They are withdrawing, Captain.

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:22.874
Come in.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.511
You asked to see me, Captain?

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.675
Mr. Paris...

01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:31.719
you have a problem.

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:34.050
l've invited Chakotay

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.613
and the other Maquis
to become part of this crew.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.349
lt seemed the only
reasonable thing to do

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:39.893
under the circumstances.

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.519
Will you provide
a bodyguard for me, Captain?

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:44.326
lt seems you already have one.

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:46.196
l do?

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:49.896
Mr. Chakotay said something
about his life belonging to you.

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:52.940
He'll be taking responsibility
for your safety.

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:56.374
l think l'm going to enjoy this.

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.412
Don't be so sure.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:00.470
He'll also be my First Officer.

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:03.312
Everyone aboard this ship
will report to him--

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:07.219
including the Lieutenant
assigned to conn.

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.153
Me?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:13.490
l've entered into the Ship's Log
on this date

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:16.587
that l'm granting
a field commission of Lieutenant

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:18.632
to Thomas Eugene Paris.

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:24.830
Congratulations.

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:30.240
Um, for the first time
in my life,

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.108
l don't know what to say.

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.546
You've earned this, Tom.

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:37.141
l'm only sorry
your father won't know.

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.685
Oh, he'll know...

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:42.613
when we get back.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:46.217
Ah, Captain, we were
just coming to see you.

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:48.262
We've supplied your ship
with water, Neelix.

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:49.557
lt's ready to go.

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:52.930
Well, you see that's what
we wanted to discuss.

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:55.195
We'd like to go with you.

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.671
l'm sorry.
This isn't a passenger ship.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.707
Of course not.

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:00.706
We won't be passengers.

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:03.003
We'd be valuable colleagues.

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:04.204
''Colleagues''?

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:07.510
Whatever you need is
what l have to offer.

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:10.073
You need a guide,
l'm your guide.

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:13.052
You need supplies, l know
where to procure them.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:16.750
l have friends among races
you don't even know exist.

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:17.756
You need a cook?

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.019
Oh, you haven't lived

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:21.220
until you've tasted
my angla'bosque.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:24.424
lt will be my job
to anticipate your needs

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:25.966
before you know you have them.

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:28.332
And l anticipate your first need

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:30.064
will be me.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.231
Captain, we both want

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.468
very much to be a part
of your journey.

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:55.259
We're alone in
an uncharted part of the galaxy.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.891
We've already made
some friends here

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:00.934
and some enemies.

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:05.404
We have no idea of the dangers
we're going to face,

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.000
but one thing is clear:

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:11.011
Both crews are going
to have to work together

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.570
if we're to survive.

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:16.674
That's why Commander Chakotay
and l have agreed

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:18.343
that this should be one crew--

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.646
a Starfleet crew.

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:25.853
And as the only Starfleet vessel
assigned to the Delta Quadrant

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.224
we'll continue
to follow our directive

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:31.527
to seek out new worlds
and explore space.

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:37.404
But our primary goal is clear.

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.337
Even at maximum speeds

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:42.968
it would take 7 5 years
to reach the Federation,

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:46.445
but l'm not willing
to settle for that.

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:49.540
There's another entity
like the Caretaker

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.811
out there somewhere

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:53.649
who has the ability
to get us there a lot faster.

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.552
We'll be looking for her

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:59.024
and we'll be looking
for wormholes, spatial rifts

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:01.493
or new technologies to help us.

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:07.901
Somewhere, along this journey,

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:10.870
we'll find a way back.

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:15.602
Mr. Paris, set a course...

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:18.042
for home.

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.101
Aye, Captain.
