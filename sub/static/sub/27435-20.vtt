we spoke,

we should talk about that.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.220
built on loyalty,
justice, trust.

03:54.260 --> 03:57.195

03:57.230 --> 04:01.064

who betray it.

So that's what you're
conflicted about?

04:12.550 --> 04:15.815
Whether or not to kill me
because I betrayed
some "code"?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.087
with institutionalized codes,

04:22.120 --> 04:24.680
where order
has already been imposed

04:24.730 --> 04:27.893
by powerful forces
outside of yourself,

04:27.930 --> 04:30.660
where there are laws and rules
for everything.

With no laws, no rules,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.499

04:35.540 --> 04:38.100
So I have to impose my own.

04:38.140 --> 04:43.043
I'm not conflicted
about killing you.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.106
I'm conflicted
because I can't.

04:46.150 --> 04:49.916
Because I can
neither kill,

04:49.950 --> 04:53.010
nor trust,

nor forgive.

but according to

the surveillance team
he has following Anna McMahon,

05:47.340 --> 05:49.001
she's connected
to the abductions.

He's got
a surveillance team?

was taken last week,

what his connection is
with McMahon?

He doesn't know,
but he said he has a line
or two in the water.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.121
Then while he's fishing
off that pier,

on the families.

talk to the parents.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.696

them together.
Maybe they know what.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.265
Hey. Where have you
been hiding?

06:18.310 --> 06:20.437
What do you mean?
You've been a ghost ever since

06:20.480 --> 06:23.677
I told you that I've been
looking into
who Reddington was.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.439
Thought maybe you were
still pissed at me.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.540
What? No.
I'm grateful.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.788
You did what you thought
was best for me.

There's something else.

be easy for you to hear.

No.

07:28.910 --> 07:31.378
So you did conceive
through IVF?
Yes.

07:31.410 --> 07:34.618
But now you're telling us that
Nora is someone else's child?

07:34.650 --> 07:37.016
What sperm, what egg
doesn't matter.

07:37.050 --> 07:38.449
We want our daughter back.

New Dawn?
It was nearby.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.757
Hello, Corinne.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.724
My name is Doctor Rizal.
I'm pleased to meet you.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.988
I know you've had
a very long journey,

08:25.030 --> 08:26.634
so I got you a gift.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.069
I want to go home!

08:28.100 --> 08:30.568
I know, sweetheart,
and you will. Very soon.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.601
But let's get you changed.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.801
There's something
I want to show you,

08:34.840 --> 08:37.707
something I built for you.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.868
Corinne, Nora.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.504
_You'_re both
unique ihdiViduals.

09:05.540 --> 09:07.906
And together,
we're gonna change the world.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.859
Obviously, we're horrified to
think that there
could have been

09:20.890 --> 09:24.678
any sort of improprieties
here at New Dawn.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.482
We have stringent protocols

09:26.530 --> 09:29.397
that would render a mistake
nearly ImpOSS|ble.

09:29.430 --> 09:32.024
Well, we have reason
_ to believe
this wasn't a mistake.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.766
The Walkers and the Mitchells,
they were both clients?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.495
Anne, before
you answer that...

09:36.540 --> 09:38.303
RESSLER: We can subpoena
medical records.

09:38.340 --> 09:39.898
No. Please.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.703
I want to be clear
we're ready to cooperate

09:41.740 --> 09:43.139
in any way that we can.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.648
The Walkers and Mitchells
were both clients.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.545
In June of 2010.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.172
And they shared
the same doctor?

09:49.220 --> 09:52.348
Actually, they had two
different
fertility specialists

09:52.390 --> 09:54.813
working with two
entirely different staffs.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.885
So how does that explain
the mix-up?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.023
You do not
have to answer this.

09:59.060 --> 10:01.654
I've looked at their cases,

10:01.700 --> 10:04.396
every staff member,
every person
in the chain of command,

10:04.430 --> 10:07.092
and the only possible wrinkle
I can imagine

10:07.140 --> 10:08.994
might be in embryology.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.235
Meaning...?
On the day of transfer,

10:11.270 --> 10:14.603
the cultured embryo is taken
from our incubators on site

10:14.640 --> 10:16.073
directly to the mother.

10:16.110 --> 10:19.568
Now, it's possible,
yet highly unlikely,

10:19.610 --> 10:21.578
that the embryologist
could have swapped out

10:21.620 --> 10:24.111
the cultured genetic
material with...

10:24.150 --> 10:26.539
I don't know.
Something else.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.854
Like an embryo
cultured off-site?

10:28.890 --> 10:30.221
Y...You said that the women

10:30.260 --> 10:32.080

Wait. You... You know?

14:01.470 --> 14:04.007
His name was Ilya Koslov.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.167
He and Katarina
were childhood friends,

14:06.210 --> 14:08.235

in the Cabal together.

was after Katarina,

14:14.980 --> 14:18.143
the only way for
her to survive
was to access the funds

to frame Reddington.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.851
Yeah, but they couldn't do it

brought him back to life.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.499
That's the answer that
Reddington killed people

I mean, why?
I don't know.

Cooper and Aram.

he is Reddington.

does it make sense

he'd kill to keep quiet?

15:22.250 --> 15:25.083
That so many people have died
trying to find out?

She can't die.

33:33.870 --> 33:36.270
I'm begging you. Please.
She cannot die!

(DOOR OPENS)

33:48.560 --> 33:49.982
How is she?

33:50.020 --> 33:52.181
In surgery, if you care.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.527
Of course I care.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.448
I created her.
I created all of them.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.368
To be human guinea pigs.
Why?

34:00.570 --> 34:02.959
Because you eat meat.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.104
Waste water. Guzzle gas.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.505
You like riddles?

34:06.540 --> 34:08.098
Not particularly, no.

34:08.140 --> 34:09.869
How many SUVs
does it take the FBI

34:09.910 --> 34:12.378
to bring in
a Single suspect?

34:12.410 --> 34:14.617
I counted Six. You think
I've committed a crime?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.868
You're killing the planet.
And I suppose that you're

34:16.920 --> 34:19.684
trying to solve it by, uh,
experimenting on children.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.553
50,000 years ago, a relative
of the modern-day human

34:22.590 --> 34:25.980
lived on the Indonesian island
of Flores.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.794
Because resources were scarce,
people adapted,

34:28.830 --> 34:30.229
by becoming smaller.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.069
Adults were only
three feet tall.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.399
As a result,
they consumed less, had
a smaller carbon footprint.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.658
If we're going to
survive climate change,

34:37.700 --> 34:39.668
we have to adapt
to our environment

34:39.710 --> 34:42.372
the same way Homo floresiensis
adapted to theirs.

34:42.410 --> 34:44.071
I want us to survive.

34:44.110 --> 34:46.499
To do that,
we have to evolve.

34:46.550 --> 34:49.075
And since we don't have _time
to wait on natural selection,

34:49.120 --> 34:51.145
I figured out a way
to speed up the process.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.919
Oh, by changing their DNA?

34:52.950 --> 34:56.181
As temperatures increase,
_ fresh water
Will become scarce.

34:56.220 --> 34:58.927
Rivers will dry up,
springs and aquifers

34:58.960 --> 35:01.428
Will become_c_ontaminated
by the rismg seas.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.599
People will die of thirst.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.860
Unless their kidneys
become more powerful,

35:05.900 --> 35:08.391
capable of processing
the higher salt content.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.169
Yeah, CSI said
that you forced

35:10.200 --> 35:12.236
those little girls
to drink salt water.

35:12.270 --> 35:14.534
And expose them
to extreme heat.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.730
The genetic changes
I made to Corinne's DNA

35:16.780 --> 35:20.443
increased her tolerance
to both by 12%.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.368
Multiply that
by 7 billion people,

35:22.420 --> 35:24.342
and you begin to see
a glimmer of hope.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.915
So, Corinne, the little girl
you tried to save,

35:26.950 --> 35:30.056
she's... She's
your chosen one.

35:30.090 --> 35:31.580
First of a new breed.

With the hospital.

35:44.140 --> 35:46.233
Corinne's out of surgery.
She's gonna be okay.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.374
That's great.
And the others?

Mr. Reddington?

this connects to Anna McMahon.

If he knows anything,
he hasn't told me.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.833
Given how angry he is with me,
I think I'd be
the last to know.

36:18.870 --> 36:22.328
Why's he angry With you?
Family squabble?

36:24.880 --> 36:27.075
Is that What we are?

36:27.850 --> 36:30.512
I'm not so sure.

36:30.550 --> 36:34.179
I've been thinking about it
a lot recently, and, uh...

36:34.220 --> 36:38.429
I don't think I know
What "family" even means.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.849
I thought Tom and I
were gonna adopt,

that family had nothing to do
With biology.

taught us anything,
it's that it doesn't.

Family isn't about bloodlines.

37:00.680 --> 37:04.741
No one would blame them for
walking away from those kids.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.042
But I'm guessing that learning

37:07.090 --> 37:09.012
biology isn't What's
keeping them together

37:09.060 --> 37:12.518
is a powerful reminder of all

She doesn't.

Did you find out
Who does?

Yes. A child.

A random child
that Bastien Moreau

gave the dossier to in the
moments before he was killed.

then he told McMahon.

He did.

I got to him.
