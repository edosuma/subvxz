We didn't go to camp
together?

02:14:54.192 --> 02:14:55.455
I, uh, never went to camp.

02:14:55.527 --> 02:14:57.689
Oh, you should have
gone to camp. It's great.

02:14:57.762 --> 02:14:59.958
I heard.

02:15:00.031 --> 02:15:01.055
Are you in sports?

02:15:01.132 --> 02:15:02.622
Why do you ask?

02:15:02.701 --> 02:15:05.227
'Cause you really seem
very familiar to me.

02:15:05.303 --> 02:15:06.566
Are you in sports?

02:15:06.638 --> 02:15:07.571
Yeah.

02:15:07.639 --> 02:15:09.733
Are you...Sammy Sosa?

02:15:09.808 --> 02:15:10.832
No.

02:15:10.909 --> 02:15:12.843
Of course not,
because Sammy Sosa's

02:15:12.911 --> 02:15:15.346
a big Dominican man
in a Cubs uniform.

02:15:15.413 --> 02:15:17.177
Yeah. No, I work across
the street at CSC.

02:15:17.249 --> 02:15:19.115
You work for "Sports Night"?

02:15:19.184 --> 02:15:20.310
I'm a producer.

02:15:20.385 --> 02:15:21.648
You produce
"Sports Night"?

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:23.916
That's sufficiently
impressive.

02:15:23.989 --> 02:15:25.923
Oh, I don't
produce it myself.

02:15:25.991 --> 02:15:28.323
There's an executive producer
and a senior associate,

02:15:28.393 --> 02:15:30.225
both of whom
are above me.

02:15:30.295 --> 02:15:32.730
Do you think your career
progress is being thwarted

02:15:32.797 --> 02:15:35.732
by your inability
to make a parallelogram?

02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.826
-- [Laughs]
-- I actually do not, no.

02:15:38.903 --> 02:15:41.395
Think you'd have
more friends if you knew --

02:15:41.473 --> 02:15:43.237
-- I know how to make a parallelogram.
-- Okay.

02:15:43.308 --> 02:15:44.867
I also have
plenty of friends.

02:15:44.943 --> 02:15:46.536
You just prefer
to drink alone.

02:15:46.611 --> 02:15:48.409
My friends are mad
at me right now.

02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.413
Why?

02:15:49.481 --> 02:15:51.108
I broke up
with their girlfriend.

02:15:51.182 --> 02:15:52.445
Ah.

02:15:52.517 --> 02:15:56.283
Are you sure
I don't know you?

02:15:56.354 --> 02:15:58.220
No.

02:16:00.091 --> 02:16:02.287
-- The best thing for you
to do right now... -- Yeah?

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.193
Buy me a drink.

02:16:05.263 --> 02:16:06.662
Okay.

02:16:06.731 --> 02:16:08.460
[indistinct shouting]
Quiet, please.

02:16:08.533 --> 02:16:10.467
Folks, quiet!
[Shouting stops]

02:16:10.535 --> 02:16:12.469
Whoo!
Herein are the rules --

02:16:12.537 --> 02:16:17.099
Each team will send one player
to the sacred helmet of names.

02:16:17.175 --> 02:16:20.076
That player will have
60 seconds to get his team

02:16:20.145 --> 02:16:22.978
to name as many
of the celebrities written down

02:16:23.048 --> 02:16:25.142
in the sacred helmet
as possible.

02:16:25.216 --> 02:16:27.378
You may employ
any means necessary

02:16:27.452 --> 02:16:30.149
except saying any part
of the person's name.

02:16:30.221 --> 02:16:32.087
When the game is over,

02:16:32.156 --> 02:16:34.523
Dan will hoist me
on his shoulders.

02:16:34.592 --> 02:16:36.583
I'm reclaiming
my manhood today, baby.

02:16:36.661 --> 02:16:37.753
-- <i>Let's</i> go.
<i>Chris: Hang on.</i>

02:16:37.829 --> 02:16:40.025
-- What?
-- <i>Will's in the bathroom.</i>

02:16:40.098 --> 02:16:41.896
-- We shall wait.
-- Yes, we shall.

02:16:41.966 --> 02:16:42.898
Casey?

02:16:42.967 --> 02:16:44.230
[Laughter]

02:16:44.302 --> 02:16:45.826
You snapped
your fingers?

02:16:45.904 --> 02:16:47.235
-- Yes.
-- Why?

02:16:47.305 --> 02:16:51.138
-- To get you to come to me quickly.
Have you spoken to Dan yet? -- Ah.

02:16:51.209 --> 02:16:52.574
-- No. No, 'cause you know why?
-- Casey...

02:16:52.644 --> 02:16:54.236
'Cause I don't want
to ruin his good time tonight.

02:16:54.312 --> 02:16:57.338
Why don't you use this opportunity
of Will being in the bathroom --

02:16:57.415 --> 02:16:58.348
I'm back!

02:16:58.415 --> 02:17:01.112
Yes, you are,
thank God.

02:17:01.186 --> 02:17:03.484
Before we start, I'd like
to ask a question.

02:17:03.555 --> 02:17:05.352
-- Is it about the rules?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:17:05.423 --> 02:17:07.289
-- <i>What?</i>
-- Does anyone know the lyrics

02:17:07.359 --> 02:17:10.692
-- to “How Are Things in
Glocca Morra?“ -- <i>I</i> do not.

02:17:10.762 --> 02:17:13.356
I have a comprehensive
knowledge of these things.

02:17:13.431 --> 02:17:14.592
We don't know
the lyrics, Isaac.

02:17:14.665 --> 02:17:16.827
Are we ready to wipe
the smug off their faces?

02:17:16.901 --> 02:17:17.959
"' Yes! "' Yes! "' Yes!

02:17:18.036 --> 02:17:20.334
Are we ready
to reclaim our manhood?

02:17:20.405 --> 02:17:21.770
-- Ugh! -- Huh! -- Vvhoo!

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:23.672
Then let
the games begin.

02:17:23.742 --> 02:17:25.471
[indistinct shouting]

02:17:32.984 --> 02:17:34.611
All right, let's go.

02:17:34.686 --> 02:17:37.519
All right, uh, this guy was attorney
general in 1973 for about 5 minutes.

02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:38.647
-- Saturday <i>Night</i> Massacre --
-- Elliot Richardson.

02:17:38.723 --> 02:17:39.986
-- <i>After</i> him.
-- <i>William Ruckelshaus.</i>

02:17:40.058 --> 02:17:41.583
-- Yes! -- Ooh. -- Ooh.

02:17:41.659 --> 02:17:43.388
This guy
defeated Montezuma.

02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:44.291
-- Cortés.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:17:44.361 --> 02:17:45.454
-- Need a first name.
-- Chris...

02:17:45.530 --> 02:17:46.429
-- Come on, come on.
-- Jack.

02:17:46.498 --> 02:17:47.692
-- <i>There it is</i> -- <i>Jack.</i>
-- <i>Aw.</i>

02:17:47.766 --> 02:17:48.927
<i>It was Jack!</i>

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.492
His friends called him Jack.
This guy got Al Capone.

02:17:51.568 --> 02:17:52.468
-- Elliot Ness.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:17:52.537 --> 02:17:54.665
Uh, t-this guy was
one of the Monkees.

02:17:54.739 --> 02:17:56.228
-- Davy Jones.
-- Not Davy Jones, but...

02:17:56.307 --> 02:17:58.366
-- Veronica.
-- No, what?!

02:17:58.442 --> 02:17:59.535
No, Veronica w--

02:17:59.611 --> 02:18:01.807
-- <i>Played the tambourine.</i>
-- <i>That wasn't</i> a <i>real band.</i>

02:18:01.879 --> 02:18:02.870
Yeah, well,
neither are the Monkees!

02:18:02.947 --> 02:18:04.108
They're real people, okay?

02:18:04.182 --> 02:18:06.241
-- <i>And the guy, like</i>
a <i>mouse</i> -- -- Time!

02:18:06.316 --> 02:18:07.250
[Groaning]

02:18:07.317 --> 02:18:08.843
<i>Time!</i>

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.718
[Light laughter]
Veronica?

02:18:10.789 --> 02:18:12.257
Well, yeah, 'cause I put
her name in the helmet.

02:18:12.323 --> 02:18:13.449
I thought that maybe
you picked it.

02:18:13.525 --> 02:18:14.651
Yeah, you thought
there was some crossover

02:18:14.726 --> 02:18:16.216
between the Archies
and the Monkees?

02:18:16.294 --> 02:18:18.058
Hey, look, I'm under a certain
amount of pressure here!

02:18:18.129 --> 02:18:19.528
-- Yeah, well, you're dealing
with it well. -- Hey...

02:18:19.597 --> 02:18:22.430
you got four, and that's
giving you Jack Cortés.

02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.059
<i>After 3 full rounds,
we are ahead by 22.</i>

02:18:25.136 --> 02:18:26.068
[Cheering]

02:18:26.137 --> 02:18:27.536
Just call time out.

02:18:27.605 --> 02:18:29.299
-- Time out.
-- For what?

02:18:29.374 --> 02:18:31.035
-- For what? -- We need to
regroup and get some more beer.

02:18:31.109 --> 02:18:32.873
-- [ Groaning] -- Yeah, we need to
regroup and get some more beer.

02:18:32.943 --> 02:18:34.843
<i>I'm setting this alarm
for 10 minutes.</i>

02:18:34.913 --> 02:18:38.041
When this thing goes off, we come
back to finish what we began.

02:18:38.116 --> 02:18:39.549
[Laughing] Oh, my God.

02:18:39.617 --> 02:18:42.552
I don't think I'm ever gonna
get my manhood back, am I?

02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:44.951
It's not really clear you ever
had it in the first place.

02:18:45.022 --> 02:18:46.457
No, you had it,
you had it.

02:18:46.523 --> 02:18:48.458
Good evening.
From New York City,

02:18:48.526 --> 02:18:49.687
I'm Casey McCall
alongside --

02:18:49.761 --> 02:18:50.852
-- Hang on.
-- What?

02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:52.419
It's not "Good evening
from New York City."

02:18:52.496 --> 02:18:55.397
It's “Good evening“ -- comma -- “from
New York City I'm Casey McCall.“

02:18:55.467 --> 02:18:56.593
You pronounce the comma?

02:18:56.668 --> 02:18:57.760
You don't pronounce it,
but you acknowledge it.

02:18:57.835 --> 02:18:59.304
-- I acknowledged it.
-- No, you didn't.

02:18:59.370 --> 02:19:00.599
You want me
to doff my cap?

02:19:00.672 --> 02:19:02.197
-- Oh, it wouldn't kill you.
-- I don't have a cap.

02:19:02.272 --> 02:19:03.536
Then you should
doff something else.

02:19:03.608 --> 02:19:04.769
What did you have
in mind?

02:19:04.843 --> 02:19:06.368
What?

02:19:06.443 --> 02:19:08.776
-- Uh-oh.
-- No.

02:19:08.847 --> 02:19:11.373
I, uh, just took it to
the next level, didn't I?

02:19:11.449 --> 02:19:12.507
Did you?

02:19:12.584 --> 02:19:14.552
If you're not sure, then
I didn't do a good job.

02:19:14.619 --> 02:19:17.714
That's not necessarily true. I'm not
that good with these kinds of things,

02:19:17.789 --> 02:19:19.382
and usually a girl needs
to smack me in the head

02:19:19.457 --> 02:19:20.481
and hold up a sign.

02:19:20.558 --> 02:19:21.616
Good to know.

02:19:21.692 --> 02:19:22.888
There are areas
in which I'm an expert.

02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.986
-- Name some.
-- Sports.

02:19:25.063 --> 02:19:28.522
Hmm...how many home runs did
Ken Griffey hit in '97?

02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:31.570
Ken Griffey wasn't
playing baseball in '97,

02:19:31.636 --> 02:19:34.628
but his son
Ken Griffey Jr. Hit 56.

02:19:34.706 --> 02:19:36.264
-- He hit 54.
-- You are wrong.

02:19:36.341 --> 02:19:38.070
-- I don't think so.
-- I know so.

02:19:38.142 --> 02:19:39.870
-- You want to make a bet?
-- You'll lose.

02:19:39.943 --> 02:19:41.036
I don't think so.

02:19:41.111 --> 02:19:43.206
I've got the Elias Sports
Book across the street.

02:19:43.281 --> 02:19:44.976
I'm not going anywhere.

02:19:47.352 --> 02:19:49.411
I used to know these songs.

02:19:49.487 --> 02:19:51.922
I used to sing them with my friend
Cory, a rehearsal accompanist.

02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:54.288
<i>Hey, why don't you
give Cory a call?</i>

02:19:54.359 --> 02:19:55.849
Oh, he died
about a year ago.

02:19:55.927 --> 02:19:57.053
Sorry.

02:19:57.128 --> 02:19:59.222
Yeah, I can't remember
the lyrics.

02:19:59.297 --> 02:20:01.994
VVell, you're ahead of us, Isaac,
'cause we never knew the lyrics.

02:20:02.066 --> 02:20:04.330
I forgot my grandson's
name this morning,

02:20:04.402 --> 02:20:06.166
just for a moment,

02:20:06.237 --> 02:20:08.171
but it seemed
longer than that.

02:20:08.239 --> 02:20:10.401
Completely forgot his name.

02:20:10.475 --> 02:20:13.410
<i>Oh, man, when I was growing up,
my father would call upstairs</i>

02:20:13.478 --> 02:20:16.175
to me and my brother
and my sister.

02:20:16.247 --> 02:20:18.181
He'd go through
such a Rolodex of names

02:20:18.249 --> 02:20:20.274
-- <i>[Chuckles]</i>
-- <i>before he'd hit on anything</i>

02:20:20.351 --> 02:20:21.876
even in the vicinity
of our names that it...

02:20:21.953 --> 02:20:24.888
-- Yeah.
-- You work a long day.

02:20:24.956 --> 02:20:26.446
Yeah,
I'll remember it.

02:20:26.524 --> 02:20:28.424
Well, don't go far.
We're starting again soon.

02:20:28.493 --> 02:20:30.518
Yeah.

02:20:32.196 --> 02:20:33.994
It's when he gets tired.

02:20:34.065 --> 02:20:35.533
Yeah.

02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:38.297
Hey, listen, here's something
you're not gonna like.

02:20:38.369 --> 02:20:39.962
-- What? -- Uh, well, I don't
think it's a big deal.

02:20:40.038 --> 02:20:42.439
-- I don't think anybody else is gonna
think it's a big deal, either. -- What?

02:20:42.507 --> 02:20:44.908
-- <i>Hey, Jeremy.</i> -- <i>Hey, I just, uh,</i> I
<i>need to borrow your copy of Elias.</i>

02:20:44.976 --> 02:20:46.102
Uh, it's up
in the cabinet.

02:20:46.177 --> 02:20:48.202
We feel bad.

02:20:48.279 --> 02:20:49.576
It's one of those things.

02:20:49.647 --> 02:20:51.081
Hey, why don't you
stay and play?

02:20:51.149 --> 02:20:53.140
No, you know what? I think it's
better for Natalie to be able to --

02:20:53.217 --> 02:20:54.241
Nah, come on.

02:20:54.319 --> 02:20:55.809
Yeah, I'm just gonna
grab this and go.

02:20:55.887 --> 02:20:57.821
That book is mine, and it
doesn't leave the building.

02:20:57.889 --> 02:21:00.483
Do you know how anal
you are about your books?

02:21:00.558 --> 02:21:03.323
Uh, I know that Natalie's got your
manhood stuffed inside of her Prada bag.

02:21:03.394 --> 02:21:04.589
I'll make a copy.

02:21:04.662 --> 02:21:07.029
-- Let's go. -- I-l still
need to talk to you.

02:21:07.098 --> 02:21:09.089
All right, well, later.
[Chuckles]

02:21:09.167 --> 02:21:10.601
<i>Here we go!</i>

02:21:10.668 --> 02:21:13.831
We, uh, led off the last round.
You lead off this one.

02:21:14.906 --> 02:21:17.466

you like to look at me.
