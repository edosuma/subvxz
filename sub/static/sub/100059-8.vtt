00:04.047 --> 00:07.050
- If there's one thing
people say about me,

00:07.094 --> 00:09.487
it's that I'm obsessed
with serving the community.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.837
When we open our hearts
to giving,

00:11.881 --> 00:13.317
we lift each other up.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.710
- Hey, Mateo,
can I have my charger back?

00:14.753 --> 00:16.277
- Oh, my God, Justine,

00:16.320 --> 00:18.801
I am in the middle
of something, dummy.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.846
Ugh, God.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.761
Should I start over?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.720
- Probably, although that
was our best take so far.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.591
- And again, Mateo,

00:26.635 --> 00:29.072
we want the judge to see you
as a humanitarian,

00:29.116 --> 00:30.682
so maybe it doesn't help
if you keep

00:30.726 --> 00:33.163
calling people
dummies and human toilets.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.860
- Well, I can't control
who enters the shot, Amy.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.515
- Okay, let's just take it
from the top.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.301
- Hi, I'm Mateo Liwanag,

00:40.344 --> 00:43.739
American, influencer,
philanthropist,

00:43.782 --> 00:46.176
and I'm truly honored
to be serving the community

00:46.220 --> 00:47.656
by running a toy drive

00:47.699 --> 00:50.398
for a charity that's near
and dear to my heart.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.184
- River City Happy Tots.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.707
- Tots?

00:55.751 --> 00:57.535
I mean, are we even allowed
to call them that?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.276
- I don't think the kids care.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.583
- Oh, kids.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.715
I thought you meant tots
like little people.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.413
- You can just edit
that out, right?

01:05.456 --> 01:07.545
- Oh, yeah, I didn't even
press record this time.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.207
- Um, Glenn,
I wanted to ask--

01:17.251 --> 01:19.731
sorry, is this--
am I loud enough?

01:19.775 --> 01:21.472
- Yeah, I think so.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.735
- Okay, well, Jerry and I

01:23.779 --> 01:25.607
were wondering
if you could marry us.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.392
- You want me to officiate
at your wedding?

01:28.436 --> 01:31.787
- Sandra, I gave you
a long list of better options!

01:31.830 --> 01:34.746
For a small fee,
we can get Tay Zonday.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.705
The guy who sings
"Chocolate Rain"?

01:36.748 --> 01:38.315
Jeez, where have you guys been?

01:38.359 --> 01:41.362
- We want Glenn.
He's always been there for us.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.712
When Jerry was in the hospital,
he was the only person

01:43.755 --> 01:45.714
who said he wished
he could've visited.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.281
- Oh, my God, Sandra, I can't--

01:47.324 --> 01:49.587
you...

01:49.631 --> 01:52.155
I can't even begin to s--

01:52.199 --> 01:54.636
- This is who you want speaking
at your wedding?

01:54.679 --> 01:56.159
- Toy drive!

01:56.203 --> 01:57.595
Donate
to underprivileged youth!

01:57.639 --> 01:59.510
- Okay, this isn't working.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.164
Why can't we just
grab toys from the store

02:01.208 --> 02:02.209
and fake the shot?

02:02.252 --> 02:04.167
- I think faking charity

02:04.211 --> 02:06.648
is frowned upon
in immigration cases

02:06.691 --> 02:08.302
and, like, in life.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.955
- Oh, here we go.
We got a live one.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.610
- Hi.
- Oh, uh-uh.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.308
A book?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.179
Come on, that's just mean.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.659
Go.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.879
- Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers,

02:20.923 --> 02:22.620
this week, enjoy 20% off

02:22.664 --> 02:25.275
our nontoxic,
organic cotton pillows.

02:25.319 --> 02:28.539
Also enjoy wondering what
we put in the other pillows.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.194
- Hey, so what's the latest
with Operation

02:31.238 --> 02:32.848
Make Colleen Fall in Love
With You and Then Dump Her

02:32.891 --> 02:34.197
to Ruin Her Life Forever?

02:34.241 --> 02:35.720
- Well, she's been pretty busy,

02:35.764 --> 02:37.592
so I actually haven't seen her
in a couple weeks.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.811
- Oh, okay, well, let me know
when you're gonna dump her

02:39.855 --> 02:41.639
because I wanna be there.
- Mm-hmm.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.467
- I'm thinking maybe,
I don't know, a two-way mirror,

02:43.511 --> 02:44.903
or I cut some holes
in a newspaper.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.689
We'll figure it out on the day.
- Okay.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.647
- Smart.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.301
So you're stretching it out
with Colleen

02:51.345 --> 02:52.824
so you can keep dating her?

02:52.868 --> 02:55.305
- Well, that's a plus,
but it's actually true.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.611
She's just been
swamped at work.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.482
We barely even
have time to text.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.919
- Really?
She works at a Cloud 9.

03:00.963 --> 03:03.226
Everyone here
is always texting.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.836
I'm in a group chat
about "Chicago Fire,"

03:04.880 --> 03:06.925
and I don't even know
if that's a show or a fire.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.666
- Oh, I mean, well,
we text a little bit

03:08.710 --> 03:10.320
but mostly just,
like, funny memes

03:10.364 --> 03:11.626
and stuff like that.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.454
- Can I see?

03:13.497 --> 03:14.542
- Sure.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.677
- Hmm.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.723
I'm sorry, Garrett,

03:21.766 --> 03:24.247
but she ghosted you.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.467
- What?
No she didn't.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.338
- Look at all those
unanswered texts.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.340
Trust me.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.037
You know how, like, sometimes,
you have a fish,

03:32.081 --> 03:34.257
but then, like, you decide
that you don't want

03:34.301 --> 03:35.824
a fish anymore,
so you just stop feeding it

03:35.867 --> 03:37.347
and put it in the closet?

03:37.391 --> 03:38.566
That's what she's doing to you.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.915
- No, things are good.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.569
I mean, she had to reschedule
our last date

03:41.612 --> 03:43.353
because her aunt got sick,

03:43.397 --> 03:45.529
and so I just figure she's busy
dealing with that right now.

03:45.573 --> 03:49.968
- Oh, Garrett.
Girls never have aunts.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.448
- Um...

03:54.059 --> 03:55.713
- Check it out,
I've already got

03:55.757 --> 03:57.889
my official ordination license

03:57.933 --> 04:00.457
from 5-minute-minister.net

04:00.501 --> 04:02.372
- Oh, cool.
- Got your name and everything.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.593
- Now, first, I need to get
to know you better as a couple.

04:05.636 --> 04:08.422
So how would you describe
your relationship?

04:10.902 --> 04:12.730
- It's really nice.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.906
Right?
- Yeah, it's nice.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.387
- Nice, nice.
Okay.

04:17.431 --> 04:22.784
And, Sandra, what do you
really like about Jerry?

04:22.827 --> 04:25.308
- Well, let's see.

04:25.352 --> 04:29.094
I guess it's probably
how nice he is.

04:29.138 --> 04:33.490
- Okay, got it.
I'll just underline nice.

04:33.534 --> 04:38.365
Now, Jerry, what do you
like about Sandra?

04:38.408 --> 04:40.062
- She's great.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.281
- Aww.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.548
- Excuse me, where do you keep
your Transformers?

04:47.591 --> 04:48.940
- The toy section
right over there.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.464
- Oh,
and while you're over there,

04:50.507 --> 04:51.943
maybe consider buying a toy

04:51.987 --> 04:53.554
you can donate
to our toy drive.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.643
- Oh, I would,
but I already donated

04:55.686 --> 04:57.558
to the St. Louis Samaritans
guy out front.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.647
- What?
The Samaritans are here?

04:59.690 --> 05:01.431
- Yeah, and I already gave
and posted about it.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.433
It'd be weird to do
another post for this.

05:03.477 --> 05:06.131
- Couldn't you just donate
and not post?

05:06.175 --> 05:09.570
- So, like, you would post it
and then tag me, or--

05:09.613 --> 05:12.964
- Or you'd just be helping
some underprivileged kids.

05:13.008 --> 05:16.098
- And they'd post it?
Do they have phones?

05:16.141 --> 05:18.970
- Okay, the toys are back there
and to the left.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.581
- That's why we're not
getting any donations.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.973
The Samaritans are out there

05:22.017 --> 05:23.627
sucking up
all the guilty consciences.

05:23.671 --> 05:24.889
- You know, technically,

05:24.933 --> 05:26.674
they need my permission
to be here.

05:26.717 --> 05:27.979
- Yeah, how dare they try

05:28.023 --> 05:29.633
to help people
without your permission?

05:29.677 --> 05:32.462
- Exactly, this isn't
a charity free-for-all,

05:32.506 --> 05:33.681
although I do like
the Samaritans.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.900
They do great work.
I'm a fan, really.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.075
- Oh, just kick them out
already.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.164
- Yep, they gotta go.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.039
Hi, I'm Amy Sosa,
store manager.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.475
- Hi.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.651
Kyle Sawyer,
generosity manager.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.566
- So I think
it's great you're--

05:49.610 --> 05:51.568
- Thank you, happy holidays!
- Could you--

05:51.612 --> 05:53.048
could you stop ringing
the bell for just a second?

05:53.091 --> 05:54.702
- I gotta give 'em
the bell, Amy.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.443
People give, they want bell.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.967
- Huh, right, yeah.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.491
So, look, I think it's great
you're out here,

06:01.535 --> 06:02.753
but you need permission,

06:02.797 --> 06:03.798
so I'm gonna
have to ask you to--

06:03.841 --> 06:04.886
- Well, I have permission.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.540
I sent you an email last month.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.151
- Uh, no, I think I would
have remembered that.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.109
- Oh, yep, here we go.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.677
I said I wanted to come down
and collect donations today,

06:13.721 --> 06:15.853
and you responded,
quote, "Sounds great!"

06:15.897 --> 06:17.855
Exclamation point, end quote.

06:17.899 --> 06:20.684
See, little...
exclamation point there.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.469
- Okay.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.688
But that isn't
exactly permission.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.429
I just said, "Sounds great!"

06:26.473 --> 06:28.039
As in, "Sounds great

06:28.083 --> 06:32.609
that you want to do charity,
as an idea."

06:32.653 --> 06:33.784
- Uh-huh, okay.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.699
It's just that
that's ridiculous,

06:35.743 --> 06:37.701
and I'm already here so--

06:37.745 --> 06:39.877
- Okay, look,
I'm gonna level with you.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.097
We're doing a toy drive inside
for our friend,

06:42.140 --> 06:44.447
and no one's giving because
they've already given to you.

06:44.491 --> 06:47.711
So could you maybe
just come back another day?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.452
- I mean, look,
this is your mistake.

06:49.496 --> 06:53.456
I shouldn't have to leave
because you're a bad manager.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.545
- Uh, okay, wow.

06:55.589 --> 06:58.548
Uh, I was trying to be nice,
but this is over.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.028
You need to leave now.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.117
Hey, you hear that, people?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.118
Huh?

07:03.161 --> 07:04.728
Little Miss Manager here

07:04.772 --> 07:06.469
says that I have to stop
raising money,

07:06.513 --> 07:08.732
so people can spend more
in her store!

07:08.776 --> 07:10.560
- Wow, so that's what
this store is about.

07:10.604 --> 07:11.605
Money.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.477
- No!
Well, yes, but--

07:14.521 --> 07:16.131
it's just--it's a bad day
for him to be here.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.915
- Oh, sorry.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.874
Well, just let me know
when you can pencil in a time

07:19.917 --> 07:21.223
for poor people to eat.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.747
- Ugh, okay, you know what?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.662
It's fine.
You can stay.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.098
- You know what?

07:27.142 --> 07:28.665
I bet they sell everything
for more

07:28.709 --> 07:30.101
than it cost them
and keep the profit.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.581
- We didn't start that.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.715
That's--that's what
all stores do.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.984
- He called you a bad manager
just because you asked him

07:43.027 --> 07:44.376
to come back another day?
- Mm-hmm.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.291
- So why'd you let him stay?

07:46.335 --> 07:48.337
- Well, I mean, you know,
even though he's in the wrong.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.252
I mean,
obviously just a maniac,

07:50.295 --> 07:52.384
it just kinda seemed
like bad karma

07:52.428 --> 07:54.125
to kick out the Samaritans.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.518
It's gonna be fine.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.998
We just have to
find a way to get

07:57.041 --> 07:59.087
customers excited
about donating.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.523
- Maybe we should humanize it.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.525
You know, you could
connect with people.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.396
You could tell 'em your story.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.181
- Talk to the customers?
Gross.

08:06.224 --> 08:08.662
- Yeah,
he's been through enough.

08:14.581 --> 08:18.323
- Donate to our toy drive
and get a free $5 gift card!

08:18.367 --> 08:20.717
- It's good for anything
in the store,

08:20.761 --> 08:22.719
especially eyebrow tweezers.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.113
- Donate
to the St. Louis Samaritans!

08:25.156 --> 08:28.551
We give people money for food
instead of toys they can't eat.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.335
- Excuse me.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.599
I just want you to know
that if you donate inside,

08:32.642 --> 08:36.385
you get a $5 gift card
instead of nothing.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.604
- Hey, what the hell?

08:37.647 --> 08:38.996
You stole my mark?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.215
Foul on the play!

08:40.258 --> 08:41.564
- Okay.
- Foul on the play.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.087
- Okay, don't--
- Over here, people!

08:43.131 --> 08:44.524
- We can just--
- Step right up and give!

08:44.567 --> 08:46.090
Don't give anything
once you're inside!

08:46.134 --> 08:47.439
- You're being very aggressive!
- Hey!

08:47.483 --> 08:49.311
That's a rental.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.226
- Well, we don't allow
street performers out here,

08:51.269 --> 08:54.664
so you'll just have to come
get it at the end of the day.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.624
Molly, hand these out, please.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.495
- Wow, that guy--

08:59.539 --> 09:01.453
I was seriously thinking
about punching him for you.

09:01.497 --> 09:05.153
- Aw, Jonah,
no one believes that.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.330
- Colleen's gonna be so jealous
when you Instagram this.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.593
Look at how much better off
you are without her.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.726
You're happy, totally jacked.

09:12.769 --> 09:15.293
- Yeah, just traveling
the world shirtless.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.774
- She's gonna feel so sorry
she dumped you.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.384
- If she dumped me.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.256
- Garrett, no, it's over.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.605
You need to move on.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.476
You should have
some rebound sex.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.304
- No, again,
nothing to rebound from, so--

09:26.348 --> 09:29.307
- Oh, Carol, do you want
to have sex with Garrett?

09:29.351 --> 09:30.744
- No, no, no, no.

09:30.787 --> 09:34.051
- I'd be open to it.
Colleen seems lovely.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.706
- Oh, no, it would actually
just be the two of you.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.622
Colleen ghosted him, so--
- Didn't get ghosted.

09:39.666 --> 09:43.147
- Oh, um, I'm really
just focusing

09:43.191 --> 09:45.193
on myself these days, so...

09:45.236 --> 09:47.151
- Oh, no, okay, well,
that was not a real offer,

09:47.195 --> 09:50.415
so you're not rejecting me!

09:50.459 --> 09:52.330
- You're Sandra's
maid of honor, right?

09:52.374 --> 09:55.203
I mean, how well do you know
her and Jerry as a couple?

09:55.246 --> 09:56.639
- Not much to know.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.249
- They're two people
who look alike

09:58.293 --> 09:59.555
that are getting married,
end of story.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.643
- That's what
I'm worried about,

10:00.687 --> 10:01.775
The more time I spend
with them,

10:01.818 --> 10:03.385
the more I'm starting to think

10:03.428 --> 10:04.778
that they're each
just marrying the first person

10:04.821 --> 10:06.040
who was nice to them.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.563
- Eh, so what?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.609
You're an officiant,
not a marriage counselor.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.175
- I'm not just gonna marry
two people

10:11.219 --> 10:13.047
who don't know each other.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.701
I took an oath
for my ordination.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.834
I ticked a box
and clicked next.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.836
- You know, at this point,
I think

10:19.880 --> 10:21.403
all we should be worried about
is keeping them

10:21.446 --> 10:23.710
from having kids.

10:23.753 --> 10:24.798
- From the bottom of my heart,

10:24.841 --> 10:26.582
thank you for your donation.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.280
This toy will go to a child
who will cherish it--

10:29.324 --> 10:32.153
- Yeah, cool,
give me the gift card.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.764
- Well, probably won't end up
using that one,

10:34.808 --> 10:36.679
but the gift cards
are a great idea.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.421
Our customers go insane
when they hear the word "free."

10:39.464 --> 10:41.423
- Yeah, don't you remember
when we gave pretzels away

10:41.466 --> 10:42.554
for Oktoberfest?

10:42.598 --> 10:43.773
They came from out of state.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.166
- Uh, guys.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.471
- Oh, God.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.082
What do you want?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.562
- Well, look, I'm sorry
about earlier.

10:50.606 --> 10:54.088
I brought a little
peace offering for you.

10:54.131 --> 10:57.613
- Oh, okay, well, thank you.
- Oh, oh, oh.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.573
Just this one.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.706
- You're donating one Army Man.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.666
- Oh, sorry, is this not a toy?
It looks like a toy.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.363
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

11:08.406 --> 11:09.712
Plays like a toy.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.322
Go ahead, give it a few "pews."

11:13.629 --> 11:14.586
- Thank you.

11:14.630 --> 11:18.547
Mateo, give him his gift card.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.896
- That's great, thank you.

11:19.940 --> 11:23.595
Ooh, and I will also
be donating this.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.162
Gift card, please.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.555
- No, you don't get a gift card

11:26.598 --> 11:28.252
for every stupid
little Army Man.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.602
- Stupid little Army Man?

11:30.646 --> 11:32.735
Wow!

11:32.779 --> 11:35.259
This guy does not
support our troops!

11:35.303 --> 11:38.262
- No, no!
I support the troops.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.655
Especially the American ones.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.222
- Okay, sir, I'm sorry.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.746
It's just one gift card
per customer.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.748
- Hmm, weird, doesn't say that
on the flyer.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.619
- Well, no, but that's just--

11:47.663 --> 11:49.665
- Kinda sounds like you made
another mistake.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.797
Between this and the emails,
I mean,

11:50.840 --> 11:52.363
how did you become manager?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.452
You win it in a raffle
or something?

11:54.496 --> 11:55.802
- What emails?
- Nothing.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.281
- She said
I could be here today

11:57.325 --> 11:58.761
and then backed out of it.
- No, no.

11:58.805 --> 11:59.762
- You didn't.
- What?

11:59.806 --> 12:01.503
- I did not.
I didn't, I--

12:01.546 --> 12:04.680
what I said was
that the idea of him being here

12:04.724 --> 12:07.465
sounded great.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.685
- And that's different?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.295
That's different.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.775
- Look, just admit
you're bad at your job,

12:12.819 --> 12:14.298
and I'll be on my merry way.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.432
Um, no.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.564
No, I'm not gonna admit that,

12:19.608 --> 12:21.697
because I didn't
do anything wrong.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.787
Mateo, give him the gift card.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.310
- Really?
- Um, Amy--

12:26.354 --> 12:27.529
- It's fine,
I know what I'm doing.

12:31.228 --> 12:34.231
- Thank you so much.
Ooh, $5 gift card.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.712
Can I have my gift card,
please?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.410
- Oh, thank you, wow.
Can I have a gift card, please?

12:39.454 --> 12:41.282
I think I'm gonna be taking
the rest of the gift cards,

12:41.325 --> 12:42.457
to be honest.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.980
That's a gift card.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.677
And that'll be
a gift card, there.

12:45.721 --> 12:46.766
This'll be a gift card
for sure.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.902
- Hi, happy holidays.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.382
- Save it.
I'm not here to donate.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.949
My manager informed me
that you may be in violation

12:55.992 --> 12:57.385
of our solicitor guidelines.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.082
- Oh, I am very familiar
with your guidelines.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.562
No signage larger than 11x18.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.390
I am 10 feet from the entrance.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.218
And a certificate
from my organization,

13:04.261 --> 13:06.873
which I've had notarized
just in case.

13:06.916 --> 13:10.398
- Ooh, notarized.
You mind if I touch the seal?

13:10.441 --> 13:12.182
- Please,
that's what it's there for.

13:12.226 --> 13:15.490
- Mm-hmm, you're telling me.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.579
- Huh, okay, well,

13:17.622 --> 13:20.016
you don't appear to be in
any dress code violation,

13:20.060 --> 13:22.149
no gang colors,
no visible swastifications,

13:22.192 --> 13:24.064
and I see you've got
multiple layers

13:24.107 --> 13:25.500
in case of a temperature swing.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.415
- Oh, well, yeah,
you know, St. Louis.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.286
If you don't like the weather,
wait five minutes.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.422
Nice.
Wait five minutes.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.033
Yeah, that's well put.
It's true.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.208
It's a true thing.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.298
You know what?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.214
- Wow, thank you so much.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.520
- I have really good vision.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.957
I find, like, $8 a day.
It's no big deal.

13:48.001 --> 13:51.047
Wait five minutes.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.919
- You gave him money?

13:52.962 --> 13:54.485
- He told a great joke
about the weather.

13:54.529 --> 13:55.922
- Amy, just admit
that you're wrong

13:55.965 --> 13:57.184
and then he'll leave.
- No!

13:57.227 --> 13:58.925
I'm not wrong.
- Right.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.623
Nobody thinks
you think you're wrong,

14:01.666 --> 14:04.452
but Mateo kinda needs
this toy drive to go well.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.193
- I'd donate myself, Mateo,

14:06.236 --> 14:08.108
but I have my own kids
to buy toys for.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.284
It's not personal.
- I didn't think it was.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.634
- Okay, fine,
it's a little personal.

14:12.677 --> 14:16.029
- What kind of organization
hires a guy like that anyway?

14:16.072 --> 14:17.639
I mean, I bet this whole
Samaritans thing

14:17.682 --> 14:19.423
is just a big scam.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.425
- Yeah, like those charities
that send someone a cow

14:21.469 --> 14:24.124
in a third world country
and then it just ends up taking

14:24.167 --> 14:25.647
a bite out of their TV
and, like,

14:25.690 --> 14:27.388
hogging the shower and stuff.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.608
- Was that--
are you thinking of a cartoon?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.045
- You know what's a scam?

14:32.088 --> 14:33.873
Those hot Marines on Facebook.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.353
Don't send them money
till you have the nudes.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.138
- That's good advice.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.922
- If folks are looking
for a good place to donate,

14:39.966 --> 14:42.011
my church makes it super easy.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
They take money straight out
of my bank account,

14:43.970 --> 14:45.275
so I don't even
have to think about

14:45.319 --> 14:46.668
whether I can afford
to give that month.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.191
- You don't even
have to give money

14:48.235 --> 14:49.366
to make a difference.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.281
I donate my hair
to chemo patients.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.109
- Don't you have to grow
your hair really long?

14:53.153 --> 14:54.328
- No, anytime I get a trim,

14:54.371 --> 14:55.329
I just sweep it
into an envelope

14:55.372 --> 14:56.678
and mail it to the hospital.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.071
- You send them tiny bits
of your hair?

14:58.114 --> 14:59.463
What do they do with that?

14:59.507 --> 15:01.552
- Whatever they want, Amy.
It's their hair now.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.685
- Aww.
- We're getting off-track.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.514
The point is
that this guy is a jerk,

15:06.557 --> 15:08.298
and we need to take him down.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.039
- Uh-huh, yeah, and this is all

15:10.083 --> 15:12.172
still about Mateo
and the kids, right?

15:12.215 --> 15:14.304

The friendly non-ghost,
and guess what?

16:08.532 --> 16:10.317
She never even got my texts
because her phone

16:10.360 --> 16:12.101
was in her car
and her car got towed.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.581
- Oh.

- And when she finally
got her phone back,

it didn't work

my girlfriend

made up
the greenhouse effect.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.597
What's that?
It's established science?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.730
Oh, okay.
Turns out, it's science, so...

16:32.774 --> 16:34.689

but she's gonna reach out
as soon as she gets back.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.264
- Great, that's awesome.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.527
- Stop it, I can tell
you don't believe it.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.094
- Why wouldn't I believe it?

16:48.137 --> 16:49.617
- 'Cause it's
highly improbable!

16:51.184 --> 16:53.142
- So I got us a little privacy.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.014
Okay, Sandra, I want you

16:55.057 --> 16:57.146
to take a good,
long look at Jerry,

16:57.190 --> 16:59.279
then close your eyes

16:59.322 --> 17:01.107
and imagine he's dead.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.456
- Aww.

17:02.499 --> 17:03.718
- I'm okay, Sandra.
- No, you're not.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.676
You're dead.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.070
Now, imagine
that you're talking to someone

17:08.114 --> 17:09.115
who never met Jerry.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.551
How would you describe him?

17:10.594 --> 17:12.640
- Um, he was--

17:12.683 --> 17:14.555
- And you can't say nice.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.600
- Asian American?

17:16.644 --> 17:18.428
- Is this still going on?

17:18.472 --> 17:20.256
It is not that hard.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.562
What do you like most
about Jerry?

17:21.605 --> 17:22.606
- I mean--
- Come on, out with it.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.825
- I--
- Let's go, now!

17:23.868 --> 17:25.740
Now, yes, words!
Now, speak, go!

17:25.783 --> 17:27.611
- I really enjoy Jerry's body.

17:29.526 --> 17:33.095
And how it responds
to my touch.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.749
- Okay.
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.230
Glenn, take this down.
Sandra, keep going.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.275
Jesus, do I have to
do everything?

17:41.277 --> 17:42.670
- Okay, I don't think that's--

17:42.713 --> 17:45.499
- He just really knows
where to kiss soft

17:45.542 --> 17:48.154
and where to kiss hard.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.112
- I had a great teacher.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.853
- Dina!

17:51.896 --> 17:55.335
- It is my honor to provide
these toys to your tots

17:55.378 --> 17:58.512
on behalf of myself
and my love of country.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.514
When I first came
to America, I...

18:01.906 --> 18:03.169
Forgot to silence my phone.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.650
We should just take it
from the top.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.478
Amy, how's my hair?
- I'm not brushing it again.

18:08.522 --> 18:09.871
- Sorry, I should
really get going.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.351
- It's fine,
I'll just piece together

18:11.394 --> 18:12.700
something from
what we already have.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.441
For me, editing
is the final stage

18:14.484 --> 18:16.138
of the writing process.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.792
- Thanks again.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.533
You're gonna make
a lot of kids very happy.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.230
- My pleasure.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.193
- God, I'd love to see
the look on "Kyle's" face

18:27.236 --> 18:29.195
as all these toys
wheel past him.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.805
- I know we don't like the guy,
but his name

18:30.848 --> 18:32.720
probably is Kyle, right?

18:32.763 --> 18:34.461
- Whose side are you on?

18:34.504 --> 18:38.508
- Guys, uh, so that was
someone from Happy Tots

18:38.552 --> 18:40.119
saying they're gonna be late.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.863
- 'Tis the season, dicks.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.175
- What the hell?
You're stealing our toys?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.350
- Technically,
you donated them to me.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.395
- Well, technically,
you can suck it!

18:55.438 --> 18:57.223
- Nope, leave it, no!

18:57.266 --> 18:59.834
Stop.
- No, okay, this is mine now.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.314
- Hey.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.231
Stop stealing from our charity,
crazy people.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.971
- Jonah, why are you
filming this?

19:07.015 --> 19:09.060
- It's really hard not to.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.454
- Ah!
- Go, go, go.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.369
- Over my dead body!

19:13.413 --> 19:14.979
Amy, get in front.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.459
Amy, you are blowing this!

19:18.374 --> 19:20.898
- Samaritans rule!

19:25.425 --> 19:27.035
- Hey, I downloaded this app
that predicts

19:27.078 --> 19:28.732
what you and Colleen's babies
would look like.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.169
Beautiful.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.735
You gotta show her these
before you dump her.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.911
- Yeah, those babies
look great.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.043
- Yeah.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.437
- Uh, you know, actually,

19:37.480 --> 19:39.221
Colleen and I
aren't a thing anymore.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.180
- What?
- Yeah.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.182
- Well, I told you to tell me
before you broke up with her.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.446
- I know, but, um,
I wanted to surprise you.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.231
- Well, tell me everything,
how did she take it?

19:49.275 --> 19:52.016
- Bad.
I mean, real, real bad.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.888
She was--she was a mess.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.237
I bet.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.804
Oh, she's probably doing
that pathetic

19:56.847 --> 19:58.545
look-how-great-I'm-doing
stuff on Instagram.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.981
- Mm-hmm, yep.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.939
There it is.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.811
Look at this
totally fake picture

20:03.854 --> 20:05.987
of her and some hot guy
at a concert.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.250
- Yeah, so fake.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.904
- Ugh, nobody's buying it,
Colleen.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.862
You look way too happy.

20:11.906 --> 20:14.822
- Yeah, I saw that.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.476
- But since we didn't have
a full-length mirror,

20:16.519 --> 20:19.566
we just watched ourselves
in a big sheet of tinfoil.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.785
- I felt like a movie star.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.919
- Okay, again,
could we talk about things

20:24.962 --> 20:26.834
outside the bedroom?

20:26.877 --> 20:30.316
- Um, well, I like when Jerry
cooks me my favorite meal.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.491
- Noodles.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.234
- Well, that's nice.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.148
- And he does the dishes.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.934
Once I walked up behind him,
and I said,

20:39.977 --> 20:42.328
"I think there's one dish
you're forgetting,

20:42.371 --> 20:44.939
and it's very dirty."

20:48.464 --> 20:50.423
- So this is the best
you could do?

20:50.466 --> 20:52.294
- Well, I mean,
it does kinda look like

20:52.338 --> 20:54.122
you're throwing the toys
onto the truck.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.341
- This sucks.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.864
Can't we just use
the video of me

20:56.907 --> 20:58.300
donating to that guy
when I thought

20:58.344 --> 20:59.954
he was with Happy Tots?

20:59.997 --> 21:02.304
- You know, technically,
we did collect toys

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
that went to charity, right?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.569
I mean, who cares if it's
Happy Tots or Samaritans?

21:06.613 --> 21:09.311
- I mean, I care, because
the Samaritans are trash, but--

21:10.486 --> 21:12.575
I guess trash kids
need toys too.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.186
- Weird, Garrett wants
to hang out tonight,

21:15.230 --> 21:17.145
because he doesn't feel
like being alone.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.973
He's just messing with you.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.148
Ignore him.
