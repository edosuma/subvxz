I love going to the

Eh. A little starchy.

Oh, I wonder why
it's taking so long

01:19.375 --> 01:21.375
to find my favorite
shirt back there.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.000
Gotta wear it for my

01:24.000 --> 01:25.375
So, Bob...

01:25.375 --> 01:28.000

I'll bring it over to you.

Okay.

Come on, guys.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.291

Alright, let me

Oh, no!

02:06.416 --> 02:09.000
No, no!
That's not right! (sighs)

02:09.000 --> 02:11.416
This shirt
is too uncomfortable.

02:11.416 --> 02:12.875
I'll check the attic!

02:12.875 --> 02:15.416
Maybe something
up there could replace...

02:15.416 --> 02:17.708

my favorite shirt.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.875
(sighs)

02:19.875 --> 02:22.375
Bob sure is upset
about that lost shirt.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.958
He needs it

03:20.875 --> 03:23.375
Rolly... why are we stopping?

03:23.375 --> 03:25.625

Where are you going?

03:31.750 --> 03:32.875
Hi, Jackie!

03:32.875 --> 03:34.500
We're on a mission for Bob.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.166
We're rescuing
his lost shirt.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.000
A rescue mission, huh?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.833
I'm pretty good
at finding lost things.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.375
I could come help you look.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.125
Bingo:
That's a great idea!

03:43.125 --> 03:44.750
Hang on. Let me just get down!

03:45.958 --> 03:47.416
(train chugging)

03:54.083 --> 03:56.458
-That was awesome!
-Puppy parkour!

03:56.458 --> 03:58.000
Now, let's find that shirt!

04:08.208 --> 04:10.166
Okay, I have a plan.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.708
We hop up on the dumpster,

04:11.708 --> 04:14.458
climb into the air vent there,
crawl through the ducts,

04:14.458 --> 04:15.875
then zipline
down into the--

04:15.875 --> 04:17.875
Or we could just
follow him inside.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.416
That's a better plan.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.000
The shirts are
all in the back.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.375
But the dry cleaner man's
blocking the way.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.583
Now, were did I put my glasses?

04:32.583 --> 04:33.875
Huh?

04:33.875 --> 04:35.291
Now's our chance.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.875
Go, go, go!

04:40.958 --> 04:43.375
Ah! Gotcha!

04:43.375 --> 04:45.625
Bob's shirt is green
with stripes.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.333
It's gotta be
here somewhere.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.291
We'll find it.
How many shirts could
there possibly be?

04:50.291 --> 04:51.416
(all gasp)

04:52.458 --> 04:53.750
Rolly:
That's how many.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.625
We need to split up.
Here's my plan.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.083
I'll take over here,

04:59.083 --> 05:00.458
Jackie'll go over there,

05:00.458 --> 05:02.000
and ROlly takes the middle.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.708
Whoever finds it first,
yell "I got it!"

05:04.708 --> 05:07.291
Great. Let's do this.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.583
Okay, Bob's shirt.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.708
Where are you?

05:18.708 --> 05:21.083
Nope. Not it.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.625
Ah, that's not it. Nope.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.125
Not. Nada.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.458
Green shirt with stripes.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.125
Aw, man. I can't see
anything from down here.

05:30.416 --> 05:32.833
Maybe if I climb up there,
I'll have a better view.

to like this place.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.875
Jackie, what is this?

07:58.875 --> 08:00.458
It's a security system.

If you cross in front of
even one of these lights,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.625

09:19.708 --> 09:21.875

09:21.875 --> 09:24.750

Which means...

10:04.750 --> 10:07.416
This is kinda fun!
Whee!

10:07.416 --> 10:08.875
-(Rolly grunting)
-(thudding)

10:08.875 --> 10:10.208
I can't stop!

10:10.208 --> 10:11.750
We gotta save him!

10:11.750 --> 10:13.500
-(hook thuds)
-Hold this.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.875
No! No! No! No! No!

10:16.875 --> 10:18.125
Whoa!

10:18.125 --> 10:19.750
"Go to the cleaners,
get Bob's shirt,

10:19.750 --> 10:21.875
have a few laughs."

10:21.875 --> 10:23.291
-(Rolly screams)
-Hang on, Rolly!

10:23.291 --> 10:24.750
Gotcha!

10:24.750 --> 10:26.875
Ooh!

10:26.875 --> 10:29.291
-(chewing)
-(ratcheting)

10:31.833 --> 10:32.958
(gulps)
Bingo!

10:32.958 --> 10:34.833
-The shirt!
-(all gasp)

10:34.833 --> 10:36.875
We have to go back
and get it.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.166
We can't!

10:38.166 --> 10:40.625
We'd never make it
back into the vents
with all this wind.

10:40.625 --> 10:41.875
What's the plan, Bingo?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.375
You always have a plan.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.500
I-- I'm all out of plans.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.250
So the shirt
is really gone?

10:47.250 --> 10:48.583
After all that?

10:48.583 --> 10:49.750
-(bell chimes)
-All: Huh?

10:49.750 --> 10:53.583
I can't believe I forgot
to turn the air conditioner off.

10:53.583 --> 10:56.833
(chuckles)
It would have gotten mighty
chilly by tomorrow morning.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.250
Brr!

10:58.250 --> 10:59.583
Wait a second.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.875
This is the shirt Bob needs!

11:01.875 --> 11:03.125
How did I--?

11:03.125 --> 11:05.833
Well, I'll bring it to him
on my way home.

11:05.833 --> 11:09.875
And I'll bring some of these
for those cute, wrinkly pups.

11:11.416 --> 11:12.708
(bell chimes)

11:12.708 --> 11:13.875
Yes!

11:13.875 --> 11:15.375
Happy dance!
Happy dance!

11:15.375 --> 11:17.166
Does this mean we did it?

11:17.166 --> 11:18.458
It sure does!

11:18.458 --> 11:20.000
Can we high-paw now?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Because I've been waiting
to high-paw for, like, forever.

11:23.000 --> 11:23.875
(all laughing)

11:23.875 --> 11:24.958
-Yes!
-Yes!

11:24.958 --> 11:27.333
(laughing)

11:29.833 --> 11:32.000
-(doorbell rings)
-Bob: Coming!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.291
Oh! This shirt
won't work either!

11:34.291 --> 11:35.875
(grunting)

11:35.875 --> 11:37.375
Great gears!

11:37.375 --> 11:39.000
(angelic chorus)

11:39.000 --> 11:41.875
My shirt! Oh!
You brought it back!

11:41.875 --> 11:44.458
-Now I won't be nervous
for my speech tomorrow.
-(barking)

11:44.458 --> 11:45.875
Thank you.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.750
We rescued the shirt,
Mr. Steener!

11:47.750 --> 11:49.708
I was told there'd
be dog treats.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.166
(barking)

11:51.166 --> 11:53.583
And I brought
a couple of treats
for these fellas, too.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.333
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did!

11:57.125 --> 11:58.708
It was amazing, Bob!

11:58.708 --> 11:59.875
I found it on the counter.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.958
It was sitting there
just like magic!

12:02.958 --> 12:05.416
Those really were
the best dog treats ever.

12:05.416 --> 12:07.583
Right? They make me
wanna go like...

12:07.583 --> 12:09.458
Whee-hoo! Whee-hoo!

12:09.458 --> 12:12.833
Both:
Whee-hoo! Whee-hoo! Whee-hoo!

12:12.833 --> 12:15.000
(both laughing)

12:17.125 --> 12:19.625
(Bingo speaks)

12:20.625 --> 12:21.875
(gasps)
It's her!

12:21.875 --> 12:23.750
It's her!
It's gotta be her!

12:26.250 --> 12:27.958
Nope.

12:27.958 --> 12:29.208
Is that Grandma?!

12:30.583 --> 12:32.250
(giggling)

12:33.458 --> 12:36.583
-Nuh-uh.
-We see Grandma all the time.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.708
You pups know
what she looks like.

12:38.708 --> 12:41.083
Yeah, but we just can't
wait for her to get here!

12:41.083 --> 12:42.500
We're so excited!

12:42.500 --> 12:44.166
(giggles)

12:44.166 --> 12:46.208
We always have the
best time with Grandma.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.750
Well, my mom should
be here any minute.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.125
I'm glad she offered
to pet-sit you guys

12:51.125 --> 12:52.583
while I'm at a conference today.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.083
We love Grandma!

12:54.083 --> 12:55.458
Yeah, hanging
with Grandma's more fun

12:55.458 --> 12:57.291
than a bag
of squeaky toys!

12:57.291 --> 12:59.000
And I have the best naps,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.416
because she always
takes the both of you

13:00.416 --> 13:02.166
out to play all day.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.166
(chuckles, sighs)

13:04.166 --> 13:06.875
I wanna take a nap
just thinking about it.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.083
And don't forget,
when I come back,

13:09.083 --> 13:12.500
we're all going to a concert
of my mom's favorite musician.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.875
-(engine idling)
-(Bingo and Rolly gasp)

13:21.166 --> 13:22.500
Bingo:
There's Grandma!

13:22.500 --> 13:23.833
There's Grandma!

13:23.833 --> 13:25.458
Oh, this is gonna be
the best day ever.

13:25.458 --> 13:26.833
I just know it!

13:26.833 --> 13:29.333
-(barking)
-I love getting
to spend the day

13:29.333 --> 13:32.958
with my favorite grand-pups
and grand-kitty,.

13:32.958 --> 13:34.125
(meow)

13:34.125 --> 13:36.083
Who wants to wrastle? Hmm?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.708
You do! You do!

13:37.708 --> 13:38.875
-She's a good wrastler.
-(Rolly giggles)

13:40.083 --> 13:41.958
She might even
be better than Bob!

13:41.958 --> 13:43.125
-(Rolly barks)
-(Bob chuckles)

13:43.125 --> 13:46.166
You three sure are
full of energy today.

13:46.166 --> 13:50.083
We're going to need
all the energy we can get,

13:50.083 --> 13:52.000
because I want to
give my grand-pups

13:52.000 --> 13:55.166
the best day ever
with their grandma!

13:55.166 --> 13:57.291
(chuckles)
Hey, you goofballs!

13:57.291 --> 14:00.000
Make sure you and Grandma
save some of that energy

14:00.000 --> 14:01.208
for the concert tonight.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.000
We don't want anyone
falling asleep

14:03.000 --> 14:04.250
because they're too tired.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.458
Us? (chuckles)
Tired?

14:06.458 --> 14:08.875
-Never!
-(barking)

14:08.875 --> 14:10.166
See you fellas later!

14:10.166 --> 14:12.291
Bye, Hissy!
Bye, Mom!

14:12.291 --> 14:13.458
(barking)

14:13.458 --> 14:14.833
See you tonight!

14:14.833 --> 14:17.708
Can't wait for the concert.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.333
Hey, Hissy.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.166
I made you a special blanket.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.250
It's extra fluffy and cozy

14:24.250 --> 14:26.125
for all those naps you take.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.375
Oh, Grandma's
the greatest. Ever.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.583
Now, you wait
right here, pups.

14:31.583 --> 14:34.458
I've got some surprises
for you, too.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.000
Bob said he wants to make sure

14:36.000 --> 14:38.250
we have enough energy
to enjoy the concert tonight.

14:38.250 --> 14:39.958
That means Grandma, too.

14:39.958 --> 14:41.416
And Bob would be
super sad

14:41.416 --> 14:42.875
if she missed
the concert tonight,

14:42.875 --> 14:44.416
because she was too tired.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.208
That means our mission
is to make sure

14:46.208 --> 14:47.250
we don't tire her out.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.458
How do we do that?

14:48.458 --> 14:52.583
Well, we get tired whenever
we run around and play a lot.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.625
So we have to make sure

14:53.625 --> 14:55.708
she doesn't run around
or play too much.

14:55.708 --> 14:59.250
Who's ready to run around
and play all day?

14:59.250 --> 15:00.958
(both gasp)

15:03.750 --> 15:07.166
Hope you're ready for
a lively game of fetch!

15:07.166 --> 15:08.416
Remember, Rolly.

15:08.416 --> 15:10.208
No running
or playing, but--

15:10.208 --> 15:12.291
That means no fetching!

15:12.291 --> 15:14.500
-I was afraid of that.
-Grandma: Come on!

15:14.500 --> 15:17.250
I used to pitch
for my baseball team.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.250
Which means I know
how to really throw!

15:20.250 --> 15:22.458
(stick whistling)

15:23.625 --> 15:25.291
She can really throw!

15:25.291 --> 15:27.458
How 'bout we start with
the "no fetch" stuff later?

15:27.458 --> 15:28.708
Totally.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.125
(barking excitedly)

15:31.125 --> 15:32.583
(both panting)

15:32.583 --> 15:34.208
(both grunt)

15:34.208 --> 15:35.708
(both laughing)

15:35.708 --> 15:37.458
Where'd you go, stick?

15:37.458 --> 15:40.000
Yeah! We really
wanna fetch you!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.083
(gasp)

15:42.291 --> 15:44.125
(both straining)

15:45.458 --> 15:47.333
-I got it!
-Me, too!

15:47.333 --> 15:48.416
(both straining)

15:48.416 --> 15:50.208
(grunts)

15:50.208 --> 15:51.875
Let's both take it
back to her!

15:51.875 --> 15:53.250
-But slowly.
-Right.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.416
Cause we don't
wanna tire her out,

15:54.416 --> 15:56.208
by having her throw
too many times.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.083
Look at you two!

16:02.083 --> 16:05.083
Oh, I should have thrown
a stick for each of you!

16:05.083 --> 16:07.291
Luckily, I brought two!

16:07.291 --> 16:10.333
She looks like she still has
lots of energy. That's good!

16:10.333 --> 16:13.000
I kinda want to play
fetch a little longer.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.583
-Get ready for this!
-(barking)

16:22.208 --> 16:23.583
Who threw those sticks?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.083
Wowza-wow!

16:25.083 --> 16:26.875
Hey, Jackie.
That was our grandma.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.500
She used to
play baseball!

16:28.500 --> 16:30.083
No kidding?

16:30.083 --> 16:32.250
She's the best stick-thrower
I've ever seen!

16:32.250 --> 16:34.125
Think she'd throw
a stick for me?

16:34.125 --> 16:35.208
Absolutely.

16:35.208 --> 16:36.625
I'll go unbury one of mine,

16:36.625 --> 16:38.416
-and bring it to her!
-Cupcake: Us, too!

16:38.416 --> 16:40.291
We need to get in
on this action.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.375
Take those sticks to the
impressive fetch lady.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.333
-Now!
-(Rufus mumbles)

16:45.333 --> 16:48.166
It's fun sharing Grandma
with the other dogs here.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.208
Yeah, but I really hope
she doesn't get tired

16:50.208 --> 16:52.125
-throwing so many sticks.
-Good point.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.708
-Hey! Throw for me!
-You're amazing!

16:57.708 --> 17:01.000
-Have you ever thought
of running for Mayor?
-I wish you were my Grandma!

17:01.000 --> 17:03.625
-Yah! Fetch!
-(dogs barking)

17:07.458 --> 17:09.875
Oh! There you are!

17:09.875 --> 17:11.125
Whew!

17:11.125 --> 17:12.583
My arms are getting tired

17:12.583 --> 17:14.833
from throwing
all these sticks.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.166
I haven't thrown
this much in years!

17:18.375 --> 17:20.000
Yah!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.166
Rolly, wait!

17:22.166 --> 17:23.625
She just said
her arms are tired!

17:23.625 --> 17:25.125
And if her arms are tired,

17:25.125 --> 17:27.500
that means all of her
might be getting tired.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.583
And that means
we need to stop playing fetch

17:29.583 --> 17:31.875
so she'll have energy
for the concert with Bob.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.375
(groans)
Okay.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.875
No more fetch.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.166
(sighs sadly, whimpers)

17:38.625 --> 17:41.750
You puppies done
playing fetch already?

17:41.750 --> 17:46.208
Well, I have lots of other
fun activities planned.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.000
Come on!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.500
-Aw!
-Bye, impressive fetch lady.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.583
Okay, pups, are you ready?

ends in eating!

19:21.458 --> 19:22.500
I love that!

19:22.500 --> 19:25.250
Yeah! And she still
has lots of energy!

19:25.250 --> 19:27.291
I think our mission
is going well, Rolly.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.416
(humming continues)

19:31.416 --> 19:35.416
Oh, you must be hungry
after all we did today!

19:35.416 --> 19:37.708
This is the
Grandma specialty.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.416
The recipe was only
enough for one,

19:39.416 --> 19:41.166
so I split it up.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.416
If you're still hungry,
I'll make more!

19:43.416 --> 19:45.208
"Bone" appetit!

19:45.208 --> 19:46.708
Bingo, this food may be

19:46.708 --> 19:49.333
the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen!

19:49.333 --> 19:51.958
I'm going to eat
every last bit of it.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.875
It smells amazing!

19:55.458 --> 19:57.500
Grandma makes the best food.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.583
Whew! Cooking really
takes a lot of energy.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.458
I'm a little tired.

20:02.458 --> 20:06.000
I'll just rest for a moment
while you eat.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.625
Rolly, wait!
Grandma says
she's getting tired.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.291
Does she look tired to you?

20:11.375 --> 20:13.333
Sorry, what'd you say?
I'm too busy eating.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.000
If we eat all this food,
she'll make more.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
(slurps)
That's exactly what I want!

20:18.000 --> 20:19.583
But if she makes more,

20:19.583 --> 20:21.458
she'll get more tired.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.708
You know what
that means, Rolly.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.083
Please don't say it, Bingo.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.583
We need to stop eating.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.583
(sighs sadly)

20:29.583 --> 20:30.833
You had to say it.

20:30.833 --> 20:34.083
It's just sitting
there being food.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.958
I want to eat it. All!

20:35.958 --> 20:37.458
You can do it, Rolly.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.416
(whimpers)

20:41.250 --> 20:42.500
(sighs)

20:42.500 --> 20:45.500
It's taking all the
Rolly power I have.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.458
This is the hardest
mission ever!

20:47.458 --> 20:50.083
(sighs)

20:50.083 --> 20:52.500
Oh, are you two not hungry?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
Bob told me
this was your favorite.

20:55.583 --> 20:58.416
-(both scream)
-Oh.

20:58.416 --> 21:00.083
So you don't like it, huh?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.583
You didn't play very much,

21:01.583 --> 21:04.125
and seemed kinda sad all day.

21:04.125 --> 21:07.583
Oh, I'm sorry today
wasn't as fun as I had hoped.

21:07.583 --> 21:11.000
Well, Bob will be here
in a little bit.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.625
You can play on your own.

21:12.625 --> 21:15.166
I'll go rest on the couch
near Hissy.

21:20.416 --> 21:21.708
Is Grandma okay?

21:21.708 --> 21:23.583
We were trying to make sure
she had enough energy

21:23.583 --> 21:24.875
to go to the
concert tonight.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.333
You also made her think

21:26.333 --> 21:27.750
that you don't like
when she pet-sits.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.458
But we love being
with Grandma!

21:29.458 --> 21:30.875
She's so much fun!

21:30.875 --> 21:32.833
Well, you gotta
do something.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.458
Because she might not
wanna pet-sit us anymore.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.958
-Aw.
-(Bingo whimpers)

21:39.708 --> 21:41.291
Bow wow.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.625
That's a sad thought.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.583
That would be the
worst thing ever.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.583
Okay!

21:46.583 --> 21:47.500
So we wanna make sure

21:47.500 --> 21:49.500
she has enough
energy for the concert!

21:49.500 --> 21:51.583
But she wanted to make sure
we had a great day!

21:51.583 --> 21:53.583
I think we can do both.

21:53.583 --> 21:54.875
-How?
-How?

21:54.875 --> 21:56.416
First things first,

21:56.416 --> 21:57.958
we gotta cheer up Grandma
by showing her

21:57.958 --> 21:59.458
we are having a great day!

21:59.458 --> 22:01.125
That means...

22:01.125 --> 22:02.500
-food time!
-Food time!

22:03.583 --> 22:05.000
Ick!

22:05.000 --> 22:06.583
Finally!

22:08.750 --> 22:10.250
Here you go, Grandma!

22:10.250 --> 22:11.583
Yeah! We ate all the food,

22:11.583 --> 22:13.166
and would love it
if you made more!

22:13.166 --> 22:14.833
(barking)

22:14.833 --> 22:16.875
Why, hello, there!

22:16.875 --> 22:19.625
(gasps)
Well, looks like you pups
want to play now!

22:21.250 --> 22:22.708
And you ate your food!

22:22.708 --> 22:25.458
Well, just seeing
your happy puppy faces

22:25.458 --> 22:27.583
gives me all the energy I need

22:27.583 --> 22:28.833
to play some more!

22:28.833 --> 22:31.125
-Shall we wrastle?
-(barking happily)

22:32.708 --> 22:34.458
Grandma really is the best.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.333
And today has been the best!

22:36.333 --> 22:38.583
-Just like she wanted it to be.
-(door opens)

22:38.583 --> 22:40.708
-(Bob laughs)
-(barking)

22:40.708 --> 22:43.000
-Hi, Bob!
-We had the best day ever!

22:43.000 --> 22:44.708
Hey there, buddies.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.125
Hi, Mom!

22:46.125 --> 22:48.833
Whoa! Those little guys
still have all that energy?

22:48.833 --> 22:51.000
Well, I hope you didn't
get too tired.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.708
Are you kidding me?

22:52.708 --> 22:55.500
I get so excited when
I'm with my grand-pups,

22:55.500 --> 22:57.750
that I have more energy
than ever!

22:57.750 --> 22:59.250
Did you hear that, Rolly?

22:59.250 --> 23:00.458
Oh, yeah, I did!

23:00.458 --> 23:01.500
It looks like
we have a...

23:01.500 --> 23:03.000
Mission accomplished!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.208
(sighs)

23:04.208 --> 23:07.000
This whole
"not tiring out Grandma" thing

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
was really exhausting.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.750
(upbeat music playing)

23:12.625 --> 23:15.833
This concert is fantastic!

23:15.833 --> 23:17.458
Nice moves, Mom!

23:17.458 --> 23:20.000
♪ ♪

23:20.000 --> 23:24.375
My grand-pets
are just the cutest!

23:24.375 --> 23:26.000
(whispers)
Looks like
I tuckered them out.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You sure did!

23:28.000 --> 23:30.583
