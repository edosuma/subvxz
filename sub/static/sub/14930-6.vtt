WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:05.639
HEY, BABE.
HEY, BABE.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.408
AREN'T YOU AT THE
GYNECOLOGIST'S?

00:07.441 --> 00:08.342
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.478
BUT YOUR APPOINTMENT'S
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.645
I MEAN,
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?

00:11.679 --> 00:14.515
I DON'T THINK YOU
REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT GOES ON THERE.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.351
UH, YEAH, YOU FIND OUT
THE SEX OF THE BABY.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.520
YEAH, LISTEN, I'VE
BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.289
I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.290
AW, COME ON, BABY,
WHY NOT?

00:22.323 --> 00:24.625
FINDING OUT THE SEX
OF THE BABY'S THE BEST PART.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.527
AFTER THAT,
EVERYTHING'S DOWN HILL.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.795
THIS IS OUR LAST BABY.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.797
IT IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO BE SURPRISED.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.365
SO YOU ARE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.134
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.603
TELL THE DOCTOR TO WRITE
DOWN THE SEX OF THE BABY

00:35.636 --> 00:36.870
AND PUT IT
IN A SEALED ENVELOPE.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.573
THEN YOU BRING THAT
HOME TO ME SO I'LL KNOW
AND YOU WON'T, OK?

00:39.607 --> 00:41.275
IGNORANCE. BLISS.

00:41.309 --> 00:44.145
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU COULD KEEP
A SECRET THAT BIG?

00:44.178 --> 00:50.218
I-I-I HAVE SECRETS
INSIDE OF ME THAT WOULD
SHOCK AND DISGUST YOU.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.187
HEY, LIL, WHAT'S
ALL THAT STUFF?

00:53.221 --> 00:54.488
OH, THEY'RE
CAMPAIGN POSTERS.

00:54.522 --> 00:59.527
I'M LILY FINNERTY,
AND I'M RUNNING FOR
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.097
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

01:03.131 --> 01:07.235
YOUR--YOUR DAD
JUST TOLD ME THE
FUNNIEST THING

01:07.268 --> 01:08.802
BEFORE YOU CAME
DOWNSTAIRS.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.037
WHAT WAS IT?

01:10.070 --> 01:14.708
UH, IT WAS THAT YOU'RE
RUNNING FOR STUDENT
COUNCIL PRESIDENT!

01:17.345 --> 01:20.681
I'M SORRY. LOOK,
I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'RE RUNNING.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.817
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.
ISN'T BRAD RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT?

01:23.851 --> 01:24.918
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.754
I DON'T KEEP UP
ON ALL OF BRAD'S
COMINGS AND GOINGS.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.390
I'VE GOTTEN OVER HIM,
AND I THINK YOU
SHOULD, TOO.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.193
OH, I DON'T KNOW
AFTER THE WAY HE
BROKE MY HEART,

01:32.226 --> 01:34.728
I'M GONNA NEED
MORE TIME.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.896
DAD, I'M SERIOUS. OK?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.598
I DECIDED TO MOVE ON
FROM BRAD

01:37.631 --> 01:40.468
AND CHANNEL MY ENERGY
INTO SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.237
OK. "BRAD SUCKS,
VOTE LILY!"

01:43.271 --> 01:44.638
HE IS GOING DOWN.

01:44.672 --> 01:49.277
OH, I FORGOT MY "O'KEEFE
IS O'KRAP" ONE.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.845
SHOULDN'T WE JUST
GIVE UP ON HER?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.747
YOU'RE STILL TRYING?

01:53.781 --> 01:56.550
HEY, ED, WHAT'S UP?

02:00.488 --> 02:03.123
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:04.425 --> 02:06.760
BABY, YOU THINK
EDDIE'S OK?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.796
SEEMS LIKE EDDIE.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.764
I THINK HE'S DEPRESSED.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.300
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.168
HE'S JUST BEEN MUMBLING
STUFF,

02:14.202 --> 02:16.804
STUMBLING AROUND IN
THE SAME PAJAMAS FOR 3 DAYS.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.273
YEAH,
SOUNDS LIKE EDDIE.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.879
HEY, ED, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.581
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?

02:27.615 --> 02:30.918
UH, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
WATCHING THE HUMIDIFIER.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.487
WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND WATCH SOME TV?

02:33.521 --> 02:34.555
IT'S GOT LESS MOISTURE,

02:34.588 --> 02:38.259
BUT THE TRADE OFF IS THAT
THERE'S PICTURE AND SOUND.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.228
NO.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.962
LISTEN, MAN, ARE...

02:41.995 --> 02:44.432
ARE YOU DEPRESSED?

02:44.465 --> 02:45.533
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

02:45.566 --> 02:47.935
I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE 33,
YOU'RE LIVING IN MY BASEMENT,

02:47.968 --> 02:49.737
YOU'VE BEEN WEARING
PAJAMAS FOR DAYS,

02:49.770 --> 02:51.739
YOU'RE WATCHING
A HUMIDIFIER.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.607
33 AND A HALF.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.576
WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT, MAN?

02:55.609 --> 02:56.944
TAKE A SHOWER,
PUT ON SOME CLOTHES,

02:56.977 --> 02:58.912
GO BE PART OF THE WORLD,
JUST WALK AROUND.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.981
IF YOU NEED MONEY,
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.883
GO WATCH A MOVIE
OR SOMETHING.

03:02.916 --> 03:06.254
UH, NAH, NAH.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.989
OK, WELL,
IF YOU WANT TO--

03:09.022 --> 03:12.626
I DON'T KNOW--IF YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT OR--

03:12.660 --> 03:15.596
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE THOSE MY PAJAMAS?

03:15.629 --> 03:17.665
YEAH. YOU WANT 'EM BACK?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.233
WHEN YOU'RE DONE, JUST--

03:19.267 --> 03:20.301
NO, IT'S, YOU KNOW--

03:20.334 --> 03:22.703
YOU CAN THROW THEM AWAY.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.607
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:26.640 --> 03:28.909
YOU KNOW HOW JIMMY
USED TO OGLE
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR?

03:28.942 --> 03:31.312
OH, YOU MEAN HE
WASN'T WRITING A NOVEL?

03:31.345 --> 03:34.248
WELL, SHE SWITCHED
ROOMS BECAUSE OF IT,

03:34.282 --> 03:36.584
AND NOW HER
GRANDFATHER'S IN THERE.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.786
AND JIMMY DOESN'T KNOW?

03:39.052 --> 03:43.524
OOH, SOMEONE'S GETTING
OUT OF THE SHOWER.

03:45.693 --> 03:46.727
OOOHHH!

03:46.760 --> 03:47.761
THERE IT IS.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.847
HEY, BABE.
HEY, HEY, BABE.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.418
HOW WAS THE
GYNECOLOGIST'S?
DID YOU GET THE SEX?

04:10.451 --> 04:13.987
AGAIN, I REALLY DON'T
THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT GOES ON THERE.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.657
WHOO.
HAND IT OVER.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.759
OK, BUT UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOU

04:18.792 --> 04:20.428
TO TELL ME THE SEX
OF THIS BABY.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.329
I UNDERSTAND.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.430
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO KNOW WITH JIMMY,

04:22.463 --> 04:23.364
AND THAT NURSE BLEW IT.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.765
YEAH, 'CAUSE
YOU ASKED HER.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.066
SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.501
DO I LOOK LIKE CONCHITA?

04:27.535 --> 04:30.270
DO NOT SAY THAT NAME
IN THIS HOUSE.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.475
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.

04:39.847 --> 04:40.748
HMM.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.851
GREAT! YOU JUST
GAVE IT AWAY!
IT'S A BOY!

04:43.884 --> 04:45.486
WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

04:45.519 --> 04:46.354
YOU OPENED IT UP
AND YOU SAID "HIM."

04:46.387 --> 04:48.622
NO, I SAID, "HMM."
WHY WOULD I SAY "HIM"?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.858
I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS
YOUR VISCERAL REACTION.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.061
OK, LET ME DO IT AGAIN,
ALL RIGHT?

04:54.094 --> 04:56.664
HRRR...

04:56.697 --> 04:57.765
OH, HEY.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.966
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS,
LILY.

04:58.999 --> 05:03.437
YOU HAVE A BRAND NEW
LITTLE BABY...

05:03.471 --> 05:04.372
SIBLING.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.038
OH...

05:05.072 --> 05:06.006
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE TIME

05:06.039 --> 05:08.075
FOR WHATEVER OLD PEOPLE
GAMES YOU'RE PLAYING.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.478
I HAVE TO COME UP
WITH A NEW CAMPAIGN.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.113
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
BEING POPULAR
ISN'T ENOUGH?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.748
APPARENTLY NOT.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.049
EXCUSE ME, FOLKS.
IS ANYBODY INTERESTED

05:16.083 --> 05:19.753
IN KNOWING HOW I PLAN
TO GET MORE INTERNET
ACCESS IN THE LIBRARY?

05:19.787 --> 05:22.590
HA HA. I THINK THE KID
WITH THE BACK BRACE

05:22.623 --> 05:25.859
PLAYING TETHER BALL
ALONE MAY WANT TO KNOW.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.096
HEY, WHY DON'T WE
HAVE INTERNET ACCESS
IN THE LIBRARY?

05:29.129 --> 05:32.366
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
JEFF. MAY I CALL YOU JEFF?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.066
OK.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.001
ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH,

05:34.034 --> 05:36.404
THE LIBRARY HASN'T BEEN
REWIRED SINCE 1991.

05:36.437 --> 05:40.774
BACK WHEN THE
INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY
WAS JUST 2 LANES!

05:40.808 --> 05:43.110
HA HA. BRAD,
NO ONE'S INTERESTED
IN THOSE THINGS.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.912
SO ARE YOU GONNA
REWIRE THE LIBRARY?

05:44.945 --> 05:45.913
THAT'S ONE WAY TO GO,
LAURA.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.482
BUT I HAVE AN EVEN MORE
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.684
TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE CHARTS.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.789
SO WHO WANTS TO HEAR
WHAT JASON SAID TO ASHLEY?

05:57.057 --> 05:59.660
HE CALLED HER A BITCH!

05:59.693 --> 06:00.528
OH, COME ON, LILY.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.829
YOU DON'T THINK KIDS
WOULD BE DUMB ENOUGH

06:01.862 --> 06:04.432
TO ACTUALLY VOTE FOR
SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT
THE SCHOOL, DO YOU?

06:04.465 --> 06:08.536
WELL, I HOPE NOT, BUT I
CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.573
DON'T WORRY.
REPLACEMENT CHILD
ON THE WAY.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.445
WHOA!

06:17.478 --> 06:19.513
LOOK WHO'S OUT
OF MY PAJAMAS.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.448
YEAH, HA HA.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.451
I THOUGHT I SHOULD
GET OUT AND DO SOMETHING.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.585
THAT'S GOOD, MAN.
WHERE'D YOU GO?

06:24.618 --> 06:25.819
I WENT TO A SHRINK.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.855
NO WAY. YOU WENT
TO A SHRINK?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.990
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
A LOT OF PEOPLE
GO TO SHRINKS.

06:30.023 --> 06:34.161
YEAH, YEAH, BUT I JUST
FIGURED AFTER YOU'RE
LAST EXPERIENCE...

06:34.194 --> 06:36.897
COME ON. COME ON,
IT'S TIME.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.600
COME O--
AH...AH!

06:39.633 --> 06:41.435
IT'S A BOY!

06:41.469 --> 06:44.572
NO...IT'S A MAN.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.708
THAT GUY WASN'T
A LICENSED THERAPIST.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.444
HE WAS JUST SOME GUY
WHO OWED ME MONEY.

06:50.778 --> 06:54.214
DR. KAGAN IS REALLY GOOD.
AND I HAVE YOU TO THANK.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.348
ME

06:55.382 --> 06:58.151
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TOLD ME TO GO OUT
AND DO SOMETHING.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.453
I DIDN'T SAY
GO SEE A SHRINK.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.554
I SAID GO SEE
A MOVIE.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.556
THAT'S RIGHT, AND
I WENT TO THE MALL
TO SEE A MOVIE,

07:02.590 --> 07:04.958
AND DR. KAGAN'S OFFICE
WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.894
WAIT, ISN'T THAT THE
PRETZEL

07:06.927 --> 07:11.064
NO, NEXT TO THAT PLACE.
ANYWAY, DR. KAGAN'S
REALLY GOOD.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.165
YOU SHOULD
COME WITH ME SOMETIME.

07:12.199 --> 07:16.436
IF YOU FIND A SHRINK
NEXT TO A CINNABON,
LET ME KNOW.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.507
HEY, ASHLEY. IT'S LILY.

07:19.540 --> 07:24.044
I'M JUST CALLING TO
MAKE SURE I CAN COUNT
ON YOU FOR YOUR VOTE.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.014
YEAH, I DID.

07:27.047 --> 07:27.881
DON'T GET MAD AT ME.

07:27.915 --> 07:31.585
JASON'S THE ONE WHO
CALLED YOU A BITCH.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.253
FINE...

07:33.286 --> 07:35.055
BITCH.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.925
LILY.
HI, BRAD.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.627
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.829
JUST ROCKING THE VOTE.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.565
I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?

07:44.598 --> 07:47.100
BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY
WIDE BASE OF SUPPORT.

07:47.134 --> 07:51.038
YEAH. A SCHOOL ELECTION
IS NOT A POPULARITY
CONTEST.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.240
HA HA. THAT'S BECAUSE
BEFORE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

07:53.273 --> 07:56.209
BETWEEN LOSER McGEE
AND DORKY McGEE.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.245
THE McGEE TWINS
NEVER RAN.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.548
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT I THINK IT'S TIME

08:00.581 --> 08:03.050
THAT POPULAR PEOPLE HAVE
VOICE IN THE SCHOOL.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.554
WILL YOU JUST PLEASE
DROP OUT FOR THE GOOD
OF THE SCHOOL?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.822
ALL RIGHT, BRAD,
HERE'S WHAT I'LL DO.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.560
I WILL VOTE FOR YOU
SO YOU DON'T GET ZERO.

08:12.593 --> 08:16.897
YEAH, WELL, I'M
ALSO VOTING FOR ME,
SO THAT MAKES 2.

08:17.598 --> 08:21.602
HEY, BRAD, I SAW YOUR
PROPOSAL FOR WIRELESS
INTERNET ON CAMPUS.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.703
THAT'S REALLY COOL.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.639
HUH. 3!

08:26.239 --> 08:30.744
I NEED TO CRUSH BRAD,
AND YOU ARE GOING
TO HELP ME.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.411
WHY?

08:31.444 --> 08:33.046
BECAUSE I AM
YOUR BIG SISTER.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.548
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.817
OK, SO YOU KNOW HOW
TAYA SWITCHED ROOMS

08:36.850 --> 08:38.619
BECAUSE YOU
WERE OGLING HER?

08:38.652 --> 08:39.587
I WAS WRITING A NOVEL.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.854
ALL RIGHT, TOLSTOY.

08:40.888 --> 08:45.125
GUESS WHERE
HER NEW ROOM IS.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.694
NO WAY.
MM-HMM.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.662
YOU HELP ME WIN
THE ELECTION,

08:48.696 --> 08:50.598
10 MINUTES OF
WINDOW TIME A NIGHT.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.800
WHAT IF I DON'T USE
ALL 10?

08:52.833 --> 08:57.104
YOU CAN
ROLL THEM OVER.

08:57.137 --> 09:01.074
THIS GUY HAS REALLY
OPENED MY EYES, SEAN.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.242
YOU SHOULD COME
CHECK IT OUT.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.579
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T NEED MY EYES
OPENED, I'M FINE.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.947
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT
LEARN SOMETHING,

09:06.980 --> 09:12.786
LIKE I'VE LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT THE DESTRUCTIVE
FORCES IN OUR FAMILY.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.055
YOU TALKING ABOUT MOM?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.324
NO, NOT HER REALLY.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.592
WELL, DAD, YEAH.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.328
NO, HE REALLY
DIDN'T COME UP.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.697
OK, SO THE ONLY
PERSON LEFT IS ME.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.766
YOU SHOULD COME CHECK
IT OUT SOMETIME.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.235
OH, REALLY. WHAT DID
YOU LEARN ABOUT ME?

09:28.268 --> 09:29.169
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.904
NO, NO, COME ON.
JUST TRY ME.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.874
YOU KNOW, DR. KAGAN
IS BETTER AT THIS
THAN I AM.

09:33.907 --> 09:34.775
NO, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.376
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT,
ALL RIGHT, EVERYTHING!

09:36.409 --> 09:38.145
ALL OF IT, ALL RIGHT?
EVERYTHING'S YOUR FAULT.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.813
YOU THINK YOU'RE
HELPING ME OUT.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.616
YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME.
YOU'RE ENABLING ME.

09:42.650 --> 09:46.319
OK? MY BIGGEST PROBLEM
IN LIFE IS YOU.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.221
OH, MY GOD.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.159
YEAH. YOU SHOULD
REALLY COME SOMETIME.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.364
HEY.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.198
HEY, BABE.

09:58.231 --> 09:58.966
OK, I CHANGED
MY MIND.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.634
I WANT TO KNOW
THE SEX OF THE BABY.

10:00.668 --> 10:03.070
NO, NO, 'CAUSE I WILL
TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.339
I WILL TELL YOU AND THEN
YOU WILL BE MAD AT ME
FOR TELLING YOU.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.975
NO, I WON'T.
I PROMISE.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.176
NO, YOU TOLD ME
SPECIFICALLY,

10:09.209 --> 10:13.380
"DO NOT TELL ME
THE SEX OF THE BABY
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY."

10:13.413 --> 10:16.149
OH, SWEETIE,
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.084
I FEEL DIFFERENT NOW.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.286
YOU SAID, "EVEN IF I SAY
THAT WAS YESTERDAY.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.655
I FEEL DIFFERENT NOW.
DO NOT TELL ME."

10:21.689 --> 10:22.589
COME ON, TELL ME!

10:22.622 --> 10:24.291
YOU SAID, "DO NOT TELL ME
EVEN IF I BEG YOU,

10:24.324 --> 10:25.659
"EVEN IF I PROMISE
TO PLEASURE YOU

10:25.693 --> 10:29.930
IN WAYS, WAYS THAT I HAVEN'T
SINCE THE CAMPING TRIP
WITH THE SANGRIA."

10:29.963 --> 10:31.198
I NEVER SAID THAT.

10:31.231 --> 10:31.865
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.266
THAT'S WHAT YOU
ALWAYS HEAR.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.436
I AM NEVER HELPING
LILY AGAIN.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.270
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.807
I WAS RUNNING THE
PERFECT CAMPAIGN...

10:39.840 --> 10:41.441
O'KEEFE IS OKAY.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.344
HERE YOU GO.
BRAD FOR PRESIDENT.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.378
BRAD FOR PRESIDENT.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.780
HEY, WHY AREN'T YOU
CAMPAIGNING
FOR YOUR SISTER?

10:46.814 --> 10:50.784
BECAUSE I LOVE SCHOOL
AND BRAD WANTS TO DO AWAY
WITH SUMMER VACATION.

10:50.818 --> 10:51.719
REALLY?
YEAH.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.753
RIGHT HERE BETWEEN
"MORE NUTRITIOUS LUNCHES"

10:52.786 --> 10:55.956
AND "ITCHIER
SCHOOL UNIFORMS."
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.024
BRAD FOR PRESIDENT.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.793
SO YOU'RE THINKING
OF VOTING FOR
BRAD O'KEEFE, HUH?

10:59.827 --> 11:04.765
WOULD THAT CHANGE IF YOU KNEW
HE WAS RUNNING A DRUG LAB
OUT OF HIS BASEMENT?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.366
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.069
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.170
AHH. GOOD JOB.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.471
LILY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
COMFORTABLE I FEEL

11:11.504 --> 11:13.440
ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE
BRAD'S RUNNING A DRUG LAB.

11:13.473 --> 11:17.210
IT'S TRUE. HE
MADE ASPIRIN FOR HIS
SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.079
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
THE SAME THING AS--

11:19.112 --> 11:20.413
OH, NO.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.514
WHAT?

11:21.548 --> 11:25.085
OOPSY. TAYA DRIPPED
CREAMSICLE DOWN
HER SPORTS BRA.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.221
ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?

11:28.255 --> 11:29.757
OH, NO, DON'T RUB IT IN.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.792
IT MAKES IT WORSE.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.227
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

11:34.261 --> 11:37.197
Jimmy's voice: BRAD O'KEEFE
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.900
BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.235
BRAD IS A MEMBER
OF THE SCIENCENAUTS,

11:42.269 --> 11:45.973
A SECRETIVE CLUB
THAT EXCLUDES WOMEN.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.208
NO GIRL EVER
WANTED TO JOIN!

11:48.241 --> 11:50.210
BRAD O'KEEFE CLAIMS HIS
MOTHER WROTE THIS NOTE

11:50.243 --> 11:53.947
EXCUSING HIM FROM GYM CLASS
BECAUSE HE HAD
AN EMBARRASSING RASH.

11:53.981 --> 11:57.885
BUT COMPARE THE SIGNATURE
TO HIS MOTHER'S
ACTUAL SIGNATURE

11:57.918 --> 11:59.787
ON THIS BOUNCED CHECK.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.824
LOOK, I HAD DERMATITIS,
OK, AND MY MOM WAS
OUT OF TOWN.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.193
WHAT KIND OF GUY
IS BRAD O'KEEFE?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.896
YOU COULD ASK
HIS DOG SPARKY...

12:08.929 --> 12:11.131
IF BRAD HADN'T
PUT HIM TO SLEEP.

12:11.164 --> 12:15.235
HE GOT HIT BY A CAR.
OK, I WAS 5.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.304
BRAD O'KEEFE.
NICE GUY...

12:17.337 --> 12:20.874
OR FORGING, SEXIST DOG-KILLER.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.042
YOU DECIDE.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.276
Lily's voice:
I'M LILY FINNERTY,

12:23.310 --> 12:26.246
AND I APPROVE
OF THIS MESSAGE.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.982
SO THEY DIDN'T GO
FOR THE NEGATIVE STUFF?

12:29.016 --> 12:30.250
NO, NO, THEY WERE
EATING IT UP.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.219
THE PROBLEM IS LILY
SUCKS AT DEBATING.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.989
AND IF WE'RE EACH WILLING
TO GIVE UP JUST 2-3
WEEKENDS A MONTH,

12:36.023 --> 12:37.324
WE CAN GET THE CAFETERIA
REPAINTED.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.193
AND THAT WILL NOT ONLY
CREATE A MORE ATTRACTIVE
EATING ENVIRONMENT,

12:40.227 --> 12:45.799
BUT IT WILL GREATLY REDUCE
THE NUMBER OF OLD PAINT
FLECKS IN OUR FOOD.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.268
WHOOPEE.
THANK YOU, BRAD.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.338
LILY, HOW WOULD YOU
MAKE ST. FINNIAN'S
A BETTER PLACE?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.940
THAT'S NOT
THE QUESTION.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.241
THE QUESTION IS,
WHY DOES BRAD CRY

12:54.274 --> 12:58.378
EVERY TIME HE WATCHES
ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE
OF THIEVES?

12:58.411 --> 13:00.247
IT'S A TOUCHING MOVIE.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.282
BESIDES, WHAT DOES
THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH BEING PRESIDENT?

13:02.315 --> 13:06.286
WELL, I DON'T THINK
WE WANT SOMEBODY WHO'S
SO EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE

13:06.319 --> 13:08.421
WITH THEIR FINGER
ON THE BUTTON.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.390
WHAT

13:10.423 --> 13:12.259
OK, THANK YOU, LILY.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.362
UH, BRAD, A STRING
OF RECENT GYM BREAK-INS

13:15.395 --> 13:17.597
HAVE LEFT ST. FINNIAN'S
WITH NO SOCCER BALLS

13:17.630 --> 13:18.565
OR VOLLEYBALLS.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.234
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
ABOUT SCHOOL SECURITY?

13:21.268 --> 13:22.402
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.371
TO PREVENT FUTURE THEFTS,

13:24.404 --> 13:26.539
I'VE WRITTEN UP
A 14-POINT PLAN

13:26.573 --> 13:30.143
CALLED "PROTECTING
OUR BALLS."

13:32.079 --> 13:35.415
THANK YOU. UH...LILY,
HOW WOULD YOU--

13:35.448 --> 13:36.950
THAT'S NOT
THE QUESTION.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.185
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LET HIM ASK IT.

13:38.218 --> 13:42.155
THE QUESTION IS,
WHY IS BRAD A RACIST?

13:42.923 --> 13:43.823
I AM NOT A RACIST.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.292
OH, YEAH? THEN HOW COME
WHEN WE WERE DATING,

13:45.325 --> 13:48.361
EVERY TIME I WANTED
INDIAN FOOD, YOU SAID NO?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.630
THE SAME APPLIES WITH
CHINESE AND MEXICAN.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.066
BUT I--I CAN'T EAT
SPICY FOODS.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.002
I HAVE IRRITABLE
BOWEL SYNDROME.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.871
AND A PATCH OF HAIR
ON HIS LEFT SHOULDER.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.239
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

13:59.272 --> 14:01.975
I'M JUST TELLING
THE PEOPLE WHAT
THEY NEED TO KNOW.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.145
YOU PUT NAKED PICTURES
OF MY DAD ON THE INTERNET.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.648
THEY WERE ALREADY THERE,
BRAD. I JUST PROVIDED
THE LINKS.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.919
YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN
HAS BEEN NOTHING
BUT PERSONAL ATTACKS.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.387
LILY, WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.489
YOU DID THIS TO
YOURSELF, BRAD.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.490
WHAT DID I DO?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.192
YOU CHEATED ON ME!

14:19.226 --> 14:20.260
YOU CHEATED ON ME!

14:20.293 --> 14:22.930
YOU GOT A NEW
GIRLFRIEND A WEEK
AFTER WE BROKE UP.

14:22.963 --> 14:23.730
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.900
WHAT ELSE AM I
GONNA SAY, YOU IDIOT?

14:26.934 --> 14:29.402
SO, SO YOU CARE?

14:29.436 --> 14:31.404
OF COURSE I CARE!

14:33.974 --> 14:35.342
OH.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.980
I GOTTA GO.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.316
Jimmy: NO, LILY, WAIT.

14:43.350 --> 14:47.120
THIS MAN KILLED HIS DOG!

14:48.221 --> 14:51.158
IT WAS A WASTE OF
A PERFECTLY GOOD
SMEAR CAMPAIGN.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.294
OH, LILY, I HEARD
ABOUT THE DEBATE.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.428
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT, OK?

14:55.462 --> 14:57.164
LILY, I STILL GET
TO USE YOUR ROOM.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.299
HEY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO USE HER ROOM FOR?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.368
I--I LIKE THE VIEW.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.172
THAT'S SICK, JIMMY.
LEAVE THAT POOR
GIRL ALONE.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.707
I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET SOMEBODY.
THIS IS DR. KAGAN.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.079
OH, SO YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO BLAMES ME FOR ALL
MY BROTHER'S PROBLEMS.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.013
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.015
SEAN, I JUST WANT TO ASK
YOU SOME QUESTIONS,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.384
MAYBE POKE UNDER
A FEW EMOTIONAL ROCKS.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.386
MY ROCKS DON'T
NEED POKING, OK?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.454
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SEAN?
WHY CAN'T YOU
HELP ME OUT HERE?

15:21.488 --> 15:22.622
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

15:22.655 --> 15:24.691
THE PROBLEM IS
I DON'T WANT TO GET
PROBED IN MY OWN HOME

15:24.724 --> 15:25.358
BY YOUR SHRINK.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.526
JUST HEAR HIM OUT--
FOR ME.

15:26.559 --> 15:30.330
SEAN, I'M JUST HERE
TO HELP EDDIE.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.266
FINE, FINE, GO AHEAD.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.369
WHY DO YOU HATE
YOUR BROTHER SO MUCH?

15:36.403 --> 15:37.570
WHAT?

15:37.604 --> 15:38.305
DON'T BLOCK. SAY
THE FIRST THING THAT
COMES INTO YOUR HEAD.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.639
CAN YOU LEAVE
MY HOUSE, PLEASE?

15:39.672 --> 15:43.476
YOUR HOUSE? YOU LIKE
TO MARK YOUR TERRITORY,
DON'T YOU?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.246
NO, IT IS MY HOUSE.
IT'S A FACT.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.480
HA HA! EASY, BOY.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.283
NO ONE'S CHALLENGING
YOUR OWNERSHIP OF
YOUR HOUSE?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.485
WAIT, IF I WAS
SO POSSESSIVE
ABOUT MY HOUSE,

15:52.519 --> 15:53.853
WOULD I LET MY BROTHER
LIVE IN MY BASEMENT?

15:53.886 --> 15:58.691
YOUR HOUSE, YOUR BROTHER,
YOUR BASEMENT.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.659
INTERESTING.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.429
SEAN, LISTEN, I
SPOKE TO, UH--

16:02.462 --> 16:03.463
HI, I'M CLAUDIA.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.332
I'M DR. KAGAN.
HE'S MY SHRINK.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.734
OH, Y SHRINK.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.102
DON'T MAKE FUN.
IT'S DEMEANING.

16:09.136 --> 16:14.407
SEAN, LISTEN, I SPOKE TO
DR. PERRY AND HE TOLD ME
THE SEX OF THE BABY.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.542
OH, SO, SO YOU KNOW?

16:15.575 --> 16:17.410
I KNOW, AND I THINK
WE SHOULD TELL EDDIE
THE GOOD NEWS.

16:17.444 --> 16:21.248
OK. OH, WAIT.
WHY DON'T YOU?
IT'S YOUR BABY.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.484
TELL ME!
NO!

16:24.517 --> 16:25.718
COME ON,
IT'S MY BABY!

16:25.752 --> 16:27.487
ABSOLUTELY NOT! NO!

16:27.520 --> 16:28.621
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN HELP WITH?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.223
NO. THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR CONCERN.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.091
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.725
SEAN KNOWS THE SEX
AND HE WON'T TELL ME.

16:32.759 --> 16:33.860
SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO KNOW.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.795
SEAN, WHY WON'T YOU
TELL CLAUDIA THE SEX
OF THE CHILD?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.397
SHE TOLD ME
NOT TO TELL HER!

16:37.430 --> 16:39.132
I WANT TO KNOW!
PLEASE TELL ME!

16:39.166 --> 16:40.133
NO!!

16:40.167 --> 16:41.634
HE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL HER
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.771
OF COURSE, BECAUSE
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.739
AND SEAN HAS TO HAVE
ALL THE POWER.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.741
"I AM POWERFUL SEAN.
FEAR ME!"

16:48.775 --> 16:54.181
NO! ALL RIGHT, SHE MADE
ME PROMISE THAT I WOULD
NOT TELL HER, OK?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.283
SHE WANTS IT THAT WAY.
TRUST ME.

16:56.316 --> 16:59.086
I DO TRUST YOU.
WE ALL TRUST YOU.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.389
I KNOW A PLACE WHERE
YOU CAN GO AND BE SAFE.
EVEN THE CHILDREN.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.492
DO I HAVE TO BRING
THE CHILDREN?

17:05.525 --> 17:10.397
SO, EDDIE, WHAT WOULD YOU
SAY TO YOUR BROTHER IF HE
WERE HERE RIGHT NOW?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.664
AHEM. I'M HERE.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.601
SHH! I HAVE MY METHODS.

17:14.634 --> 17:18.505
WELL, I GUESS I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN TOTALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.639
I COME AND GO AS I PLEASE.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.643
I BORROW MONEY ALL OVER THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD FROM EVERYBODY,

17:23.676 --> 17:25.112
AND I NEVER PAID 'EM BACK.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.315
I HAD ONE THING TO DO
AT THE BAR LAST MONTH,

17:28.348 --> 17:30.550
WHICH WAS TO FILL
THE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.851
DID I DO IT?
NO, I DID NOT.

17:31.884 --> 17:36.623
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN
EDDIE DIDN'T FILL
THE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.758
EMPTY. SO I FILLED THEM.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.794
HMM. AND DO YOU THINK
THAT WAS HELPFUL TO EDDIE?

17:41.828 --> 17:44.597
GEE, I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T REALLY
THINKING ABOUT THAT.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.532
I WAS THINKING MORE
ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS

17:45.565 --> 17:47.467
AND HOW MUCH
THEY DON'T LIKE
TO BE ON FIRE!

17:47.500 --> 17:51.571
SEAN, WHEN YOU
CONTINUALLY HELP EDDIE
OUT OF HIS MESSES,

17:51.604 --> 17:54.107
YOU'RE NOT HELPING EDDIE.
YOU'RE JUST ENABLING HIM

17:54.141 --> 17:57.877
TO GO ON BEING
THE IRRESPONSIBLE
MAN-CHILD THAT HE IS.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.811
WHAT?

17:58.845 --> 18:01.214
WHAT IS IT ABOUT EDDIE
BLOSSOMING INTO A MAN

18:01.248 --> 18:02.549
THAT THREATENS YOU SO MUCH?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.551
SEAN, WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME BLOSSOM?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.253
OH, MY GOD. WHAT
A LOAD OF CRAP!

18:06.286 --> 18:09.356
I HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE
OF YOU SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.358
AND THEN I WAS 18, AND
I HAD A KID AND A WIFE,

18:11.391 --> 18:12.559
AND I WAS STILL TAKING
CARE OF YOU.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.861
THEN I HAD 2 MORE KIDS
AND I WAS STILL
TAKING CARE OF YOU.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.396
AND NOW I'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER ON THE WAY

18:16.429 --> 18:19.332
AND I'M TAKING CARE OF YOU
AND GETTING BLAMED FOR IT!

18:19.366 --> 18:20.567
WE'RE HAVING A DAUGHTER?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.435
OR A--OR A SON.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.537
WE'RE HAVING A DAUGHTER!
CONGRATULATIONS.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.607
OH, WE'RE HAVING A GIRL.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.679
OHH...I KNEW YOU
COULDN'T KEEP A SECRET!

18:32.912 --> 18:36.249
HEY, SEAN, I'M REALLY
SORRY THAT I MAKE YOU FEEL

18:36.283 --> 18:38.518
LIKE YOU HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.786
NO, I'M--I'M SORRY.

18:39.819 --> 18:43.723
I'M SORRY THAT MAYBE
BY THINKING THAT I WAS
TAKING CARE OF YOU,

18:43.756 --> 18:46.326
I WAS ACTUALLY
NOT HELPING YOU.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.897
I'M SORRY IF I'VE
CONTRIBUTED TO...

18:50.930 --> 18:52.699
THE WAY YOU ARE.

18:52.732 --> 18:56.269
THANKS. THANKS, SEAN.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.304
BEAUTIFUL, SEAN.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.772
IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL EDDIE?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.341
UH, YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.542
ED, I WANT YOU OUT...

19:02.575 --> 19:05.678
OF MY HOUSE. AND I WANT
YOU OUT OF MY BASEMENT
BY TONIGHT.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.580
I APPRECIATE IT.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.815
I'LL BE OUT BY TONIGHT.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.950
AND I WANT YOU PULLING
YOUR WEIGHT AROUND THE BAR
FROM NOW ON.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.820
AND YOU ARE FILLING
ALL THE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.

19:13.853 --> 19:14.721
I WILL.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.490
YEAH, AND ALL THE MONEY
I'VE EVER LENT YOU

19:17.524 --> 19:18.925
OVER THE COURSE OF
OUR WHOLE LIVES,

19:18.958 --> 19:21.794
I WANT YOU TO PAY ME BACK.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.164
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, SEAN.

19:27.567 --> 19:31.604
LILY, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THE DEBATE.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.206
FINE, I QUIT.

19:33.240 --> 19:37.677
YOU WIN. CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. PRESIDENT.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.645
GO HOME.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.348
YOU SAID YOU
CARED ABOUT ME.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.382
DID YOU MEAN THAT?

19:42.415 --> 19:46.219
NO. IT'S SOMETHING YOU SAY
WHEN YOU'RE IN A DEBATE.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.587
NOW, GO.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.891
I WANT YOU TO LOOK ME
IN THE EYE AND TELL ME
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.561
OK, IF I DO THAT,
WILL YOU GO?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.729
YEAH.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.765
OK, FINE.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.801
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.437
SO YOU DO CARE ABOUT ME.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.538
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, BRAD?

20:05.572 --> 20:08.808
THAT I'M NOT OVER
YOU, THAT I STILL
LOVE YOU? FINE!

20:08.841 --> 20:11.278
I LOVE YOU!

20:13.813 --> 20:14.947
WOW.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.317
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE? YOU'RE
STILL WITH TAYA.

20:17.350 --> 20:23.723
RIGHT. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
BREAKING UP WITH HER?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.392
YOU ARE?

20:25.425 --> 20:29.896
YEAH, I'M...KIND OF
INTERESTED IN
SOMEBODY ELSE NOW.

20:29.929 --> 20:33.400
BRAD, HOW MANY GIRLS
DO YOU NEED?

20:37.604 --> 20:39.739
JUST ONE.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.681
