00:15.307 --> 00:17.935
In an age long forgotten,

00:18.018 --> 00:21.230
Legend speaks of an unsung hero

00:21.313 --> 00:24.149
Some call him the couch-crusher.

00:24.191 --> 00:28.570
To others, he's known simply as the oncoming wind.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.615
But to a special few, he's known as...

00:31.698 --> 00:32.448
Dad!

00:32.533 --> 00:33.825
Wake up!

00:34.952 --> 00:36.286
My arms are too short to reach a nerve.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.121
Why do we want to wake him up anyway?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.039
Because...

00:39.164 --> 00:40.165
It's completely unfair

00:40.249 --> 00:41.750
That he gets to veg out all day

00:41.834 --> 00:43.293
While we have to go to school!

00:45.921 --> 00:46.964
If you want him to wake up,

00:47.047 --> 00:48.549
You have to use the magic word.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.007
''Please''?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.384
-No, ''Bacon.'' -Yes!

00:51.510 --> 00:53.387
Come on, guys, you're gonna be late for school.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.680
Why does he get to sit there all day?

00:54.763 --> 00:55.305
He doesn't.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.015
He has a very important list of chores

00:57.099 --> 00:58.267
To do while I'm at work.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.227
"Get mayo''?

01:00.394 --> 01:01.478
Where's the rest of the list?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.438
Well, I've never seen him make it down to 2, so, eh...

01:04.522 --> 01:07.150
Hey! It's not as easy as it looks!

01:07.234 --> 01:07.943
You're right, I'm sorry.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.153
Please be careful, our father,

01:10.279 --> 01:12.239
On this dangerous and mighty quest.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.240
Thank you!

01:13.365 --> 01:14.408
I was being sarcastic.

01:15.868 --> 01:15.909
Thank you?

01:16.034 --> 01:16.785
Never mind.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.624
And thus begins our hero's quest.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.460
He shall not rest until he has returned

01:25.586 --> 01:27.588
With the sacred sauce.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.884
Or maybe he shall quickly rest for a little bit, 

01:31.880 --> 01:36.020
Then go on his quest for the sacred sauce!

01:38.720 --> 01:40.520
Let the quest begin!

01:52.738 --> 01:54.448
I should have put the pants on first.

01:54.740 --> 01:55.949
Oh, forget it!

02:01.747 --> 02:02.873
Cover your eyes, Margaret.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.458
The neighbor's going to the store again.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.878
Onward, Cartax!

02:10.714 --> 02:13.467
And so our hero begins his journey

02:13.550 --> 02:16.178
Through the perilous kingdom of Elmore.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.722
Go, Cartax, go! Yah!

02:20.933 --> 02:22.392
Yah! Yah!

02:24.061 --> 02:25.854
After many miles,

02:25.938 --> 02:28.023
Our warrior reaches the territory

02:28.106 --> 02:31.151
Of the oracle of suburbia.

02:31.230 --> 02:34.200
What is it, Cartax? Your hazard lights are on.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.448
Is there danger ahead?

02:39.368 --> 02:40.285
Who goes there?!

02:40.369 --> 02:40.911
Where are you?!

02:41.161 --> 02:41.703
Down here.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.956
Turn back or perish!

02:44.039 --> 02:46.667
You quest for mayo is doomed!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.168
How do you know about my quest?

02:48.293 --> 02:50.087
Underpants don't have pockets.

02:51.255 --> 02:55.425
But I can also read your future, rotund warrior.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.470
I will let you see it -- at a cost.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.764
Name your price, troll thing

03:00.848 --> 03:03.600
I know almost everything.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.561
Apart from this -- what does "L.O.L." Mean?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.937
I keep getting it in messages

03:07.020 --> 03:08.313
And want to use it myself to feel cool,

03:08.438 --> 03:09.523
But I don't know what it means.

03:10.399 --> 03:11.608
It means...

03:11.692 --> 03:12.860
Lots of love?

03:13.110 --> 03:13.777
Thank you.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.988
"Dear master of the dark arts,

03:16.113 --> 03:19.366
Sorry to hear about your mother, L.O.L"

03:19.700 --> 03:23.495
Now kneel before me!

03:33.338 --> 03:35.549
Many of Elmore's unemployed heroes

03:35.632 --> 03:38.677
Went to the supermarket and never came back.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.012
You don't mean...

03:40.137 --> 03:41.972
Yes, they got hired and now work there.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.142
I do not scare so easily, goblin head!

03:45.934 --> 03:48.645
For I am totally unemployable!

03:49.813 --> 03:52.691
Then may the spirits be with you on your journey,

03:52.858 --> 03:54.943
Destroyer of burgers.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.362
Master of the dark arts.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.406
Ugh, bummer.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.498
If you wish to pass the gates of old,

04:08.582 --> 04:12.127
You must first cross our palms with gold.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.212
What?

04:13.378 --> 04:16.298
We be the trolls of this toll booth.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.301
Pay for your passage or lose a tooth!

04:21.428 --> 04:23.096
Still don't get it. Are you speaking English?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.224
Ugh! It's 25 cents to go through.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.351
What?! Are you highway bandits?!

04:27.434 --> 04:29.269
Technically, we're in the service of the government,

04:29.394 --> 04:30.354
But, basically, yes.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.397
Then feel my wrath!

04:33.649 --> 04:35.108
My hand!

04:35.651 --> 04:36.193
My eyes!

04:36.318 --> 04:38.362
Go, Cartax, go!

04:41.698 --> 04:44.493
Toll penalty tickets!

04:58.257 --> 04:59.758
Psych!

05:04.471 --> 05:06.723
Our warrior continued his journey

05:06.807 --> 05:07.808
Through the kingdom.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.561
He almost broke his wrist honking too much

05:10.644 --> 05:13.397
In the valley of car-tastrophia.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.065
He fought for a long time

05:15.190 --> 05:19.027
To escape the deadly vortex of the drive-thru window

05:19.152 --> 05:22.114
Where your worst enemy is yourself.

05:22.406 --> 05:27.369
Until he made it to the dreaded swamps of asphalt.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.547
No!

05:38.672 --> 05:41.133
We cannot continue this way, Cartax!

05:41.216 --> 05:42.718
We must turn back.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.596
But at least the tension hasn't been artificially heightened

05:45.637 --> 05:47.222
By having that precariously balanced tree

05:47.306 --> 05:48.557
Fall and block our way.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.560
No!

05:51.685 --> 05:52.728
The tension has heightened

05:52.853 --> 05:54.438
Now that that precariously balanced tree

05:54.563 --> 05:55.731
Has fallen and blocked our way!

05:55.939 --> 05:57.816
What's that, Cartax?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.484
Can I please stop stating the obvious?

05:59.568 --> 06:02.738
What's that, Cartax? There is another solution?

06:04.323 --> 06:07.868
Cartax, no!

06:12.789 --> 06:15.667
Aagh! Don't move! I'll find a solution!

06:16.168 --> 06:18.670
What's that, Cartax? Use that plank?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.214
Yes, of course!

06:22.799 --> 06:25.385
Cartax, language!

06:26.178 --> 06:28.347
You meant put it under the tires, right.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.892
Cartax, no!

06:33.352 --> 06:34.853
I don't want to say goodbye!

06:37.564 --> 06:42.444
I love you, too!

06:44.780 --> 06:47.324
No!

06:47.407 --> 06:50.953
Alone, the warrior continued his journey.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.540
Many hours he walked to cover the hundred yards

06:54.623 --> 06:57.334
Leading to his final destination --

06:57.376 --> 06:58.752
The supermarket.

06:58.836 --> 07:03.632
But there was nothing special on offer here.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.846
Larry?!

07:08.929 --> 07:10.556
Which aisle is the mayo in?

07:10.639 --> 07:12.057
It's gone...

07:12.182 --> 07:13.475
It's all gone.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.352
Don't exaggerate, Larry.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.937
There's still a good third of it burning.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.397
What happened?

07:18.522 --> 07:21.942
The beast discovered the power of coupons.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.987
It bided its time, stockpiling them.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.323
Then it shopped us to oblivion.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.367
It bought everything in sight,

07:30.450 --> 07:33.245
Leaving nothing but destruction in its wake.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.373
Just like the witch's prophesy.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.292
Wherefore is the lair of this beast?!

07:39.626 --> 07:41.920
Surely you don't intend to fight it!

07:42.004 --> 07:44.006
My queen requires only a jar of mayo,

07:44.089 --> 07:45.716
Not the head of a beast.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.552
I don't know how you do burger night at your house, weirdo.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.929
And as night fell,

07:51.054 --> 07:54.016
Our weary traveler arrived at the arena

07:54.099 --> 07:59.271
Where the final act of his destiny shall play out.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.568
Finally, my quest has come to an end.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.904
What was it again? Oh, yeah.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.530
Get mayo!

08:38.684 --> 08:40.854
Ah, that prophesy was misleading.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.773
That's nowhere near as bad as I --

08:44.525 --> 08:47.569
It was buy one, get one free!

08:48.904 --> 08:50.447
Psych!

09:24.231 --> 09:25.524
Cartax!

09:35.158 --> 09:37.494
Psych!

09:47.379 --> 09:49.715
Cartax, go!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.246
Well, I guess he did do something today...

10:21.330 --> 10:22.581
He put his pants on.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.165
Come on.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.375
Let's set the table for burger night.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.380
And so our hero's tale comes to an end.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.050
To the beast, he is a thief.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.678
To his family, he's a huge slob.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.930
To his neighbors,

10:38.013 --> 10:42.017
He's the reason house prices are going down in the area.

10:42.100 --> 10:47.689
But to me, he will always be my master.
