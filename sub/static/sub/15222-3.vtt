<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.382 --> 00:17.942
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634

00:36.703 --> 00:40.867

00:40.940 --> 00:43.875

<i>Hey.! Hey.!</i>

01:06.499 --> 01:08.433
Over here!

01:14.274 --> 01:16.834
<i>Help.! Help me.!</i>

01:18.144 --> 01:21.773
Help! Help me!

01:21.848 --> 01:24.009
<i>Help.!
Oh, boy.</i>

02:40.226 --> 02:44.185
<i>When you leap for a living,
you expect to land in some stormy situations.</i>

02:44.264 --> 02:46.858
<i>But doing a half gainer
into an unknown ocean?</i>

02:46.933 --> 02:49.629
<i>Somehow the words "above and beyond"
seemed inadequate.</i>

02:49.702 --> 02:52.102
If anybody's listening up there,

02:52.172 --> 02:55.437
I sure could use some help.
Oh.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.605
Thank you!

03:00.680 --> 03:03.547
What? What?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.361
Up!

03:40.987 --> 03:44.548
Miss? Miss?

03:44.624 --> 03:47.957
Miss? Huh?

03:48.027 --> 03:50.655
Oh, David. Oh, help
me. Help me. Are you-

03:50.730 --> 03:52.664
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, David.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.666
It's all right. You're okay.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.668
Oh, David, is it really you?

03:56.736 --> 04:01.070
Uh, I g- I guess so, yeah.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.608
I was so scared. It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.769
It's all right. It's all right.
Don't worry.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.779
You're not David.
I'm not?

04:09.549 --> 04:11.517
Oh.
What was that for?

04:11.584 --> 04:14.109
How could you do this to me?
Do what?

04:14.187 --> 04:16.678
- I saved your life.
- Look at this dress!

04:16.755 --> 04:20.624
Oh. Where are we?
Where is everybody else?

04:21.628 --> 04:26.998
Oh, well, we're not sure, Sam. But you're
somewhere in the middle of the central Aegean Sea.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.762
<i>Where's my trunk? Oh, I'm
sorry I didn't get here sooner,</i>

04:29.836 --> 04:31.997
but we're making preparations
for Tina's birthday.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.164
<i>She wants me to pop out of
the cake. It has to be here.</i>

04:34.240 --> 04:37.334
<i>- You'll never believe what she wants me to not wear.
- Where is it?</i>

04:37.410 --> 04:40.004
There it is. There it is.
It's sinking. Come on.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.105
The Aegean Sea, Al
- What, south of Greece? North of Crete? Where?

04:43.182 --> 04:45.377
Right over there, you greasy little man!

04:45.451 --> 04:48.614
Who is this? The Miss Wet
Evening Gown contest winner?

04:48.688 --> 04:52.351
<i>- You tell me.
- I am telling you. Now get it.</i>

04:52.425 --> 04:57.624
Look, if you think that you can get out of your duty to
me by acting crazy, you don't know who you're dealing with.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.631
Now go get my trunk!

04:59.699 --> 05:03.135
<i>- I can see she's not gonna win the Miss Congeniality award.
- Well? Did you hear me? Now.!</i>

05:03.202 --> 05:06.797
She reminds me of my fourth wife, Ruth.
No, that's wrong.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.671
Fifth- Fifth? No, third wife.
My third wife, Ruthie.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.767
- Al.
- Al.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.869
Al what?

05:13.946 --> 05:18.042
I'll be damned if I'm going into the ocean
for your trunk, and I don't care who your are.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.985
<i>Uh, this is Vanessa Foster. Of the Philadelphia
Fosters. I am a very important person.</i>

05:22.055 --> 05:27.220
She's got more dough than Pillsbury. And since you
don't have any supplies whatsoever, I'd go get the trunk.

05:27.293 --> 05:30.126
- No. No way. Give me a break.
- Look, you.

05:30.196 --> 05:34.929
<i>Since you are an employee of a ship that my
fiancé hired, you have to do whatever I say.</i>

05:35.001 --> 05:37.333
And I say go get my trunk.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.928
Fine. I'll get it myself.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.100
No. All right. Just sit
- Get back in here. I've seen you swim. Geez. What a shrew.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.201
- Stop it!
- Very much.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.712
I'll have you know that
I won the bronze medal...

05:47.780 --> 05:51.773
at the Northampton Beach and Bay Club
Junior Olympics when I was merely 15.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.785
Daddy bought me a ski boat for that.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.380
- Ah.
- It's too bad it's not still here. You could ski over and get the trunk.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.391
Just answer me this, okay?
What?

05:59.459 --> 06:02.087
Are there any essentials in
the trunk? Yes, everything!

06:02.161 --> 06:04.288
Now, are you going
to go get it or should I?

06:06.265 --> 06:08.790
Go get it.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.774
<i>Please tell me you've got
food and water there.</i>

06:25.852 --> 06:29.310
<i>- Better.
- Better?</i>

06:29.389 --> 06:31.857
Mmm. Mmm.

06:31.924 --> 06:35.758
<i>Cigarettes?
I risked my life for cigarettes?</i>

06:37.196 --> 06:41.132
<i>- Mmm.
- Well, at least these might be useful.</i>

06:44.537 --> 06:47.165
What are you doing?
Get your grubby paws out of my-

06:47.240 --> 06:49.674
Give- Give me that.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.108
Trust me. I have no interest
in your underwear.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.339
I knew it.
The sun is getting to his mind.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.110
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.811
I am marooned with a pervert
on my wedding voyage.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.684
Your wedding voyage?

07:02.755 --> 07:05.519
What do you think
this is for, huh? Bowling?

07:07.927 --> 07:12.091
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. David.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.190
Who-Who's David?

07:14.267 --> 07:17.930
<i>My fiancé. My late fiancé.</i>

07:18.004 --> 07:21.872
- No, he's still alive.
- Uh, your fiancé's fine.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.034
How do you know?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.305
I, uh-

07:26.379 --> 07:30.110
- He's on a raft with the captain.
- He's in the captain's raft. I put him there.

07:30.183 --> 07:34.950
- They're gonna get picked up in about three hours, 10 minutes.
- I gave him my place.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.455
<i>You had a place on the captain's raft?</i>

07:37.523 --> 07:39.889
Well, why not?

07:39.959 --> 07:43.451
Because usually grimy, little grunts
don't travel with the captain.

07:43.529 --> 07:47.124
- Where'd I work? The engine room?
- Uh, yeah, right. Yeah, the engine room.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.691
Oh, no. Uh-uh.
I'm not buying amnesia either.

07:49.769 --> 07:54.229
And, oh, and your name
is Nikos Stathatos.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.799
<i>- Born in Piraeus, Greece,
February 12, 1935.</i>

07:57.877 --> 08:00.072
And, yeah, you worked
with the diesels in the yacht.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.484
Do you mind?

08:10.456 --> 08:14.517
<i>Uh, and David and Vanessa here were
going to get married at sea tomorrow.</i>

08:14.594 --> 08:18.189
- So I'm here to rescue her.
- You never talked to yourself when we were on the ship.

08:18.264 --> 08:23.031
- This act- - Well, in the original
history, she eventually got rescued.

08:23.102 --> 08:26.094
Then she met up with David, and they
went to Crete, and they had their wedding.

08:26.172 --> 08:30.165
- Then why am I here? - A psychiatrist told
me once that lonely people talk to themselves-

08:30.243 --> 08:32.177
desperately lonely people.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.442
<i>Uh, well, we don't-
we don't know for sure.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:38.211
Uh, but you're on the main
shipping lanes here,

08:38.284 --> 08:41.253
uh, so that you should
get picked up before nightfall.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.895
Now what are you looking for?

08:50.963 --> 08:54.797
I'm just praying that you've got
some food and water in here.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.461
It's a hope chest,
not a picnic basket.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.596
That sounds more like a no-hope chest.

08:59.672 --> 09:02.106
Wait a minute. Wait, I do.
I do have food in there.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.108
You do?
Yeah.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.371
That's great. That's the first
good news we've had.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.310
Ta-da!

09:08.381 --> 09:11.282
Gum? Hundreds of sticks of gum?

09:11.350 --> 09:14.046
You brought hundreds of sticks of
gum? Yeah. I was gonna quit smoking.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.918
Then why'd you bring all the cigarettes?
I was gonna go out with a bang.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.923
<i>She managed to do that okay.</i>

09:18.991 --> 09:22.222
<i>She snuck a smoke down by the engine room,
and that's what sank the ship.</i>

09:23.629 --> 09:26.223
You blew up the ship
because you had to have a smoke?

09:26.299 --> 09:29.632
I knew it. You were following me.

09:29.702 --> 09:33.502
Answer the question. I didn't know it was
still lit when I put it in that cigarette can.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.064
Sam, uh, bon voyage.

09:36.142 --> 09:41.409
Um, I've got to, uh,
jump up out of a cake.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.484
Now what are you doing?

09:48.154 --> 09:51.248
What are you doing?
Why did you do that?

09:51.324 --> 09:54.691
We are lost in the middle of the ocean.
There's a good chance we're gonna get rescued,

09:54.760 --> 09:59.129
but I'm not gonna risk you sinking our only
mode of survival because of your nasty habit.

09:59.198 --> 10:03.191
I don't have to take this kind of behavior
from an insolent, smart-mouthed deckhand.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.535
<i>Oh. Look what you made me do.</i>

10:07.607 --> 10:09.632
Me?
Fix it. Do something.

10:11.677 --> 10:15.169
Uh- Uh- Uh, get the gum.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.681
What?
Get the gum and start chewing it.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.721
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Mmm.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.120
Give me a piece.
Give me a piece.

10:25.191 --> 10:28.092
Give me another one. Another one.
Give me another one.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.959
What?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.662
I forgot how much sugar
they put in these things.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.799
Chew!
I am!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.467
Come on. Come on.
Give me. Give me.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.514
Let me have your hand to
hold it. Dream on, sailor.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.516
Let me have your
hand. Hold it. Oh. Ah.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.553
Get out of the way.

10:54.620 --> 10:57.316
Now what are you doing?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.881
We lost a lot of air. We gotta
lose weight, or we're going down.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.258
Oh, no you don't. Stop that!
Stop that right now!

11:03.329 --> 11:05.889
No, not my gold pumps. I have
a belt to match. This one?

11:05.965 --> 11:09.059
Yes. Oh!
Oh, my God.

11:09.135 --> 11:12.002
<i>No way. Not that. Don't you dare.
What the heck is this? What is this?</i>

11:12.071 --> 11:14.631
Grandmama's sterling silver.
Sunken treasure.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.540
Oh!

11:17.610 --> 11:20.511
No! No!

11:20.579 --> 11:23.070
What? Grandmama's favorite vase?

11:23.149 --> 11:25.777
No, Grandmama.
We wanted her at the wedding.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.587
<i>All right. She can stay.</i>

11:29.655 --> 11:32.453
- I wouldn't count on that, Sam.
- Back so soon?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.619
- This is serious, Sam. What've you been doing here?
- Just what you told me.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.596
Oh, go ahead. You can just babble
all along as much as you want.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.689
You can even drool.
But I know you're not crazy.

11:40.766 --> 11:45.635
No, Sam. You must be doing something wrong here, because
your odds of survival are going down faster than I can read.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.300
- What's the problem?
- The problem is that I'm stuck on a leaky life raft...

11:49.375 --> 11:51.741
with a crazed barbarian
who talks to himself.

11:51.811 --> 11:55.770
<i>Well, suddenly, you're getting yourself all off course.
You must be doin' something wrong, so stop doing it.</i>

11:55.848 --> 11:59.249
How can I stop doing something when I'm not
doing anything? You better figure it out.

11:59.318 --> 12:02.310
Because Ziggy says the ship
should've picked you up an hour ago.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.322
You've changed history, Sam.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.918
<i>Now Vanessa and Nikos
never get found.</i>

12:24.410 --> 12:27.072
This is totally unforgivable.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.137
We needed a sail
to get us back on course.

12:29.215 --> 12:33.948
Yeah. When we get back, the first thing I'm doing is
calling Daddy and asking if Greece has capital punishment.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.351
Anything would be
better than this.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.356
I was gonna get married
in this dress.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.155
So hungry.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.288
I figure we got about
188 more sticks of gum.

12:47.366 --> 12:52.463
Our last meal on the ship
was flatbread with caviar...

12:52.538 --> 12:54.472
and Caesar salad,

12:54.540 --> 12:57.441
paupiettes of Dover sole
with those tiny little potatoes.

12:57.510 --> 13:01.674
- Fish.
- Oh, the fish was fresh. Caught right off the ship.

13:01.747 --> 13:04.545
Now what are you looking for? The
veil that goes with that dress.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.551
No, you don't. No,
you don't. Here it is.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.349
No. Wait a second. Give me
that. Give me that. Look.

13:09.421 --> 13:12.219
No! We need a veil
to catch the fish in.

13:12.291 --> 13:17.524
Well, lookit! I'm telling you. You threw away my
favorite shoes. You used my wedding dress as a sail.

13:17.596 --> 13:20.963
You are not going fishing
with my grandmama's veil.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.297
I won't tell her if you don't.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.234
I said no.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.073
Oh.

13:34.313 --> 13:38.010
Hi, little fishy. A little sole
off the port bow there.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.017
Oh, stop it.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.815
<i>Oh, look. He's got all his little
anchovy buddies with him.</i>

13:42.888 --> 13:46.585
- They're right from the Caesar salad, you know.
- All right. Here.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.253
<i>See if you can catch some of those
little potatoes while you're at it.</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:51.387
Hold this.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.193
Over here.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.766
- Come on. Huh! What was that?
- What? What? What?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.670
I think I got something.
Don't loose it.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.072
A big one. It's big.
What is it?

14:10.783 --> 14:13.081
Don't tell me. It's a Caesar salad.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.382
Actually, it's not so bad.

14:20.459 --> 14:24.259
Yeah, if you're a seal. Look, theJapanese
practically live on this stuff, okay?

14:24.330 --> 14:27.561
Yeah, my poodle eats the grass on Daddy's
putting green. You don't see me there grazing.

14:27.633 --> 14:31.125
I'm sorry it's not cherries jubilee, okay?
But it's the best we got.

14:31.203 --> 14:35.902
So if you wouldn't mind, I gonna keep you alive.
Just sit there, shut up and eat some of this.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.466
Fine. Go to the back
of the boat first.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.478
- What?
- Go to the back of the boat first.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.481
<i>Why? Because we Fosters
always change for dinner.</i>

14:51.557 --> 14:54.025
Scoot over.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.119
Give me that. Give
it to me. All right.

15:08.007 --> 15:11.272
<i>I can't believe I'm doing this.
We don't have a choice.</i>

15:12.711 --> 15:16.078
Well, don't you ever tell
anyone I did this. Did what?

15:16.148 --> 15:20.016
If one of those tacky tabloids gets ahold
of this, I know who I'll come after.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.451
You're right. You're right.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.853
I can see the headlines now.

15:24.924 --> 15:29.520
"Socialite sucks seaweed. " They
won't be able to keep it on the stands.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.496
That's it. When we get back,
I'm reporting you to Daddy.

15:32.564 --> 15:37.399
- Is that a threat?
- My father owns the largest shipping company in the United States.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.836
<i>He's been on the cover of Look magazine.
He's frequently quoted in the Journal.</i>

15:40.906 --> 15:42.965
You sound like his press agent,
not his daughter.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.806
<i>Mmm.</i>

15:45.878 --> 15:47.812
Was he on the ship?

15:47.880 --> 15:52.010
No, thank goodness. He had
stockholders' meetings in Manhattan.

15:52.084 --> 15:56.316
But he paid for everything. Well, it wasn't
his fault that he couldn't be there.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.322
Those meetings are very important.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.324
You don't have to defend him to me, okay?

16:00.392 --> 16:02.952
I don't have to defend
my father to anyone.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.962
He's the perfect father.

16:05.030 --> 16:08.989
<i>He gives me everything
and anything that I ask for.</i>

16:11.837 --> 16:14.032
Did he ever take you
for a walk on the beach?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.408
No. Fathers are very busy.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.037
Mm-hmm. They are. Very busy.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.240
Well, you obviously
don't understand our culture.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.613
<i>No, I, um-</i>

16:25.684 --> 16:28.084
I obviously don't.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.916
My dad taught me the names
of all the constellations.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.760
<i>He said if I knew the names of the stars
above our home, then I could never be alone,</i>

16:38.831 --> 16:43.598
because I could always look up and know that
he and Mom were looking at the same stars.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.200
That's nice.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.733
Well, it's quaint.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.071
<i>But the point is, my father
loves mejust as much as yours.</i>

16:55.147 --> 16:59.140
I'm sure he does. It's just that...
from what you've been saying,

16:59.218 --> 17:02.949
it's hard for me to imagine
that there were a lot of hugs and smiles...

17:03.022 --> 17:05.718
and things like that at your house.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.281
Well, we Fosters do things differently.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.454
I mean, we feel that public displays
of affection are-

17:11.530 --> 17:13.964
Well, they're socially incorrect.

17:14.032 --> 17:17.491
- You really believe that?
- Daddy believes it.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.594
And David does too.

17:19.671 --> 17:22.070
Well, it's nice that they agree.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.133
They always agree.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.815
<i>Hey. What's, uh-
What's that one called?</i>

17:33.152 --> 17:36.519
Well, what one? Which one?
That one.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.954
That really bright star.
That one right over there.

17:39.024 --> 17:42.585
<i>- That one or the one next to it?
- No, the one next to it. The really bright one.</i>

17:42.661 --> 17:45.391
That's not a star.
That's a planet.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.455
That's Venus.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.927
Named for the goddess of love,
born from the sea.

17:53.305 --> 17:57.366
A reminder to all men's souls that...

17:57.443 --> 18:00.310
true love is the only love
worth having.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.176
That's really beautiful.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.184
Yeah, it is.

18:16.595 --> 18:21.692
Mmm. David.
I had the worst dream.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.894
Mmm.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.665
Hmm. You were covered in grease.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.101
And you never shaved.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.941
What? What?

18:35.013 --> 18:38.107
- How dare you?
- How dare I what?

18:38.183 --> 18:40.276
Use your shoulder as my pillow.

18:40.352 --> 18:43.947
- Your pillow?
- What else did you do?

18:44.022 --> 18:47.890
Well, you know, first,
I ripped off all your clothes.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.054
Then I- I pulled out my bouzouki...

18:51.130 --> 18:56.329
and played wild peasant songs
while I danced naked around the raft.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.892
Well, you just keep
your bouzouki to yourself.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.166
Fine.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.539
<i>Hey-</i>

19:04.610 --> 19:07.340
Hey. I didn't know seagulls
were out this far.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.710
That was no seagull.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.017
Neither was that.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.888
Land!

19:21.960 --> 19:24.485
Land!

19:25.497 --> 19:27.431
Oh!

19:32.271 --> 19:34.262
Oh!

19:35.607 --> 19:37.541
Mmm.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.543
Corfu!

19:39.611 --> 19:42.171
How could you be sure
this is Corfu?

19:42.247 --> 19:44.715
Are you kidding?
I have been here four times.

19:44.783 --> 19:48.617
<i>There is the cutest little bar Just
around the corner. I am dying for a mimosa.</i>

19:48.687 --> 19:53.124
Vanessa. Miss Foster!
Miss Foster!

19:53.192 --> 19:56.389
I can't hear you. Miss
Foster, just wait a second!

19:56.461 --> 19:58.691
<i>Will-There's no-</i>

19:58.764 --> 20:00.698
<i>It's not Corfu, Sam.</i>

20:00.766 --> 20:02.700
Tell me something I don't know.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.032
If it's not Corfu, where is it?

20:05.103 --> 20:08.072
<i>Well, uh, the good news-</i>

20:08.140 --> 20:11.632
Is Ziggy says there's
no dangerous wildlife here.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.908
- Where are we, Al?
- Um, there's gobs of edible flora.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.142
Al.
And the, uh-

20:18.217 --> 20:21.186
Oh. The annual average temperature...

20:21.253 --> 20:25.417
is a very comfortable 76 degrees.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.424
And-
And?

20:27.492 --> 20:32.725
And, uh, no-
nobody else sets foot on it...

20:32.798 --> 20:34.789
for another nine years.

20:47.145 --> 20:51.411
<i>10,000 silkworms gave up their lives
to make the silk for my dress.</i>

20:51.483 --> 20:55.249
It took 200 oysters to find
32 matching buttons.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.153
Nine French seamstresses
went blind sewing it together.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.784
And now, instead of
a wedding gown, what is it?

21:03.362 --> 21:05.296
Aah!

21:05.364 --> 21:08.060
Camping gear by Chanel.
Clever.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.328
Thank you.

21:10.402 --> 21:14.099
Where are you gonna sleep?

21:14.172 --> 21:16.106
Where do you think
I'm gonna sleep?

21:16.174 --> 21:18.768
Oh, no. You're not
sleeping with me.

21:18.844 --> 21:22.109
David would be furious.
He's very protective.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.114
So is Grandmama.
Trust me.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.049
David and Grandmama
have nothin' to worry about.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.020
And what does that mean?

21:30.088 --> 21:32.579
You know what? Nothin'.
Forget it. It's all yours, okay?

21:32.658 --> 21:34.717
Here you go. Whew.

21:45.103 --> 21:47.594
There's no powder room.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.642
Right next to the poison ivy.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.734
You enjoy torturing me,
don't you?

21:52.811 --> 21:56.372
No, I don't enjoy torturing you,
Miss Foster.

21:56.448 --> 22:00.077
It's just, you see, my back is killing me,
my skin feels like it's leather,

22:00.152 --> 22:02.552
and I really could use
another pair of helping hands.

22:02.621 --> 22:06.216
So if you wouldn't mind filling this
with wild grapes, I would appreciate it.

22:06.291 --> 22:09.920
I don't like grapes. Then fill
it with something you like.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.963
But don't eat it
till I have a look.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.430
Just what are you gonna do?

22:15.434 --> 22:19.097
Catch crabs, just as soon
as I find us some water.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.607
So if you'll excuse me.
This is so unfair.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.143
Trust me. You could not
handle fair. Yeah? Just try me.

22:26.211 --> 22:29.510
You eat what you find. I'll eat
what I find. How's that for fair?

22:30.982 --> 22:33.542
Wait a minute!

22:33.618 --> 22:37.076
Can't hear you.
Don't miss me too much.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.885
Daddy.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.457
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

23:16.928 --> 23:21.297
<i>Why? Is there something wrong with the
water? Oh, no. No, it was quite good.</i>

23:21.366 --> 23:24.130
In fact, I drank until
I was about to pop.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.136
Great.

23:26.204 --> 23:29.332
And then I didn't wanna pop.

23:31.376 --> 23:34.345
You didn't.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.677
In our water?

23:37.816 --> 23:39.750
In our only water?

23:39.818 --> 23:43.515
I didn't know it was our only water. Besides,
you told me I'd get poison ivy in the bushes.

23:43.588 --> 23:47.490
- That was a joke.
- Well, I guess the joke's on you then.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.587
Sam, uh, Ziggy says this water
should be cleared up by the morning.

23:52.664 --> 23:56.760
I am having a very, very hard time
keeping my cool with you.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.201
Oh, really? Well, let me see
if I can help you.

24:09.047 --> 24:12.244
<i>Mmm.</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:18.521
- Any cooler?
- Can you give me a hand? I'm not gonna pull you in.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.150
Aah!

24:23.261 --> 24:25.991
There. Now you still think
this is so funny?

24:26.064 --> 24:28.362
Huh?
Yes.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.734
You know, you guys should put on
bikinis and charge admission.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.975
Oh!
Ah!

24:48.119 --> 24:51.088
I hate to miss the exciting conclusion,

24:51.156 --> 24:54.250
but I've gotta give Tina
her birthday present.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.556
And it's a big one.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.763
Just get off.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.827
You greasy-

25:08.507 --> 25:11.738
Stay away. Get off me.

25:25.590 --> 25:29.788
You better be careful, or I might
think you're starting to like me.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.963
Well, do you?

25:39.638 --> 25:41.799
Do I?

25:41.873 --> 25:45.866
I don- I don't know.
I just met you.

25:45.944 --> 25:50.176
My, G- Look,
I just don't think that...

25:50.248 --> 25:54.776
probably in your social- s- s-social
circle, people would, like, go in for this-

25:54.853 --> 25:57.686
Yeah. I know it. You don't
like me. Kind of entertainment.

25:57.756 --> 26:00.088
I didn't say that. I just-

26:00.158 --> 26:02.854
I mean, come on.
Look at you.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.294
You're a wreck.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.256
Ah, it's all right. Nobody likes me.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.666
Oh, come on.
Somebody's gotta like you.

26:11.736 --> 26:15.103
Your fiancé, I bet-
what's-his-face- likes you.

26:16.775 --> 26:20.905
Doesn't he?
I don't know.

26:20.979 --> 26:22.947
I mean, he loves me, but-

26:24.215 --> 26:27.810
I don't know if he likes me
for who I really am.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.820
Daddy's the same.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.322
Wait a second. Uh-

26:33.892 --> 26:37.988
Are you telling me that
your own father doesn't like you?

26:38.063 --> 26:40.861
Of course he likes me.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.334
You should have seen his face
at my debutante ball.

26:46.237 --> 26:50.697
I have the most fabulous picture of he and David,
with me in the center. They had the best time.

26:50.775 --> 26:54.871
But what about you?
Did you have a good time?

26:54.946 --> 26:58.279
Of course I had a good time.
What's that supposed to mean?

26:58.350 --> 27:03.344
It's just that you're always talking about
how everybody else is feeling, you know?

27:03.421 --> 27:05.355
David, your daddy, grandma.

27:05.423 --> 27:09.189
I mean, what about you?
How-How-How are you feeling about-

27:19.537 --> 27:22.904
- What do you think you're doing? - You know
what- I'm doing the same thing you're doing.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.670
You had no right to kiss me.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.735
What are you talking about?
L- You kissed me.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.337
I did not. You seduced me.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.543
I have berries to pick,
so if you'll leave me alone.

27:33.618 --> 27:35.916
<i>Vanessa. Vanessa, come on.</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:52.998
<i>Despite all of Al's assurances, it wasn't easy
finding food in this tropical paradise.</i>

27:53.071 --> 27:57.633
<i>After four hours of playing hide-and-seek
with the crabs, I finally found something.</i>

27:57.709 --> 28:01.770
<i>Meanwhile, Vanessa
found everything else.</i>

28:04.482 --> 28:06.416
Mmm.

28:07.819 --> 28:10.652
This is heavenly.

28:13.091 --> 28:16.026
I still can't believe you knew
how to dig for clams.

28:16.094 --> 28:19.359
Daddy took us clamming
in the Hamptons every summer.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.559
Sometimes I'd eat them raw,
right out of the shell.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.967
You know, I, uh- I hate clams.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.232
<i>And you just love grapes
and toothpaste.</i>

28:30.709 --> 28:33.439
Hmm.

28:39.050 --> 28:42.247
Look, I know we had a deal,
but I don't mind sharing.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.948
I bet if you try some of these,
they'll change your mind.

28:45.023 --> 28:48.550
- No, thanks. This is-
- Come on.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.617
Come on. You have to
keep up your strength.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.069
Well? Hmm?

29:01.139 --> 29:03.004
Good.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.303
I can't have you fainting
from hunger.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.811
You're in charge
of getting us rescued.

29:09.881 --> 29:13.214
Mmm. Mmm.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.275
Already in the works.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.519
Hair spray and matches?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.528
Rescue equipment.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.824
The contents of this can
are under pressure.

29:28.900 --> 29:32.461
When we spot a ship out there,
we take this, right?

29:32.537 --> 29:38.476
Put it in the fire upside down, like so.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.445
And voilà.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.606
We die of second-degree burns?

29:43.681 --> 29:48.675
No, no, no. The can launches like a
skyrocket into the sky. Then we get rescued.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.311
<i>A rescue flare.
Yeah.</i>

29:50.388 --> 29:54.154
- That's inventive.
- Thank you.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.318
You know what this
reminds me of? Hmm?

29:56.394 --> 30:01.354
Indian Guides. Every summer I went
to sleepover camp with BetsyJohnson.

30:01.432 --> 30:04.230
You were in Indian Guides?
Uh-huh.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.999
- I mean, I was in Indian Guides.
- In Greece?

30:08.072 --> 30:10.905
Trojan Guides. The Trojan Guys.

30:10.975 --> 30:15.412
- "Guides" are what we call 'em.
- Mm-hmm.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.473
- Hey, what was your Indian name?
- Mmm. I didn't have one.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.884
- Come on. Everybody had an Indian name.
- What was your Trojan name?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.723
- Zeus.
- Zeus?

30:27.792 --> 30:29.726
<i>Yeah, Zeus. You know,
king of the gods. Yeah.</i>

30:29.794 --> 30:31.728
<i>Huh. That was me.</i>

30:31.796 --> 30:33.889
So come on. Out with it.
What was your name?

30:33.965 --> 30:36.900
- Pain in the Buffalo.
- What?

30:38.303 --> 30:40.237
Pain in the Buffalo.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.836
Come on. Knock it off,
or I'll take back my clams.

30:48.913 --> 30:52.849
I'm sorry. It's just that-
I'm- I'm sorry.

31:04.829 --> 31:07.423
<i>Hey, there's Venus again.</i>

31:07.498 --> 31:10.626
What was the saying again?
The one about true love?

31:10.702 --> 31:15.469
Um, Vanessa, about what
happened this afternoon,

31:15.540 --> 31:17.132
<i>I, uh, just-
Nothing happened.</i>

31:17.208 --> 31:19.438
- Nothing happened?
- Nothing.

31:20.511 --> 31:22.445
Then why did you
wanna talk about Venus?

31:22.513 --> 31:27.041
I was simply trying to make
polite dinner conversation.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.983
Okay, fine. Fine.

31:31.055 --> 31:34.582
<i>Since dinner's almost over, I guess we should
decide who's gonna take the first watch.</i>

31:34.659 --> 31:38.322
We can, uh, flip a coin
or toss a stick or something or-

31:38.396 --> 31:40.990
I'll do it.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.260
- You will?
- Yeah.

31:43.334 --> 31:48.328
All right. Well, you sure you know
how to launch the flare? You know just-

31:48.406 --> 31:51.398
I'm good at launching things.

31:51.476 --> 31:53.876
Okay. Uh-

31:56.247 --> 32:00.980
All right then. Lf, uh, you need me for anything
or, you know, in the middle of the night-

32:01.052 --> 32:03.520
Yeah. I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

32:03.588 --> 32:07.319
Yeah, well, that's good.

32:08.826 --> 32:11.693
<i>Ah, good night.
Bonsoir.</i>

33:02.880 --> 33:05.212
<i>You know, she really is very pretty.</i>

33:05.283 --> 33:08.116
Yeah, when she's asleep.

33:08.186 --> 33:10.677
Oh. Aren't we touchy?

33:10.755 --> 33:12.985
No, we are not touchy.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.992
Well, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.324
She's nothing but a spoiled brat.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.864
<i>Well, there's a little bit
more to it than that, Al.</i>

33:20.932 --> 33:24.197
Silver spoon in her mouth,
a pampered princess.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.532
Al, once you get past the act,

33:26.604 --> 33:29.903
she's just a- a little kid playing
at being a grown-up, that's all.

33:29.974 --> 33:33.842
Oh, yeah. It must have been really tough
being waited on hand and foot.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.846
- Tougher than you think.
- See? You like her.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.940
Me? Her?

33:41.085 --> 33:44.919
<i>I'm just trying to be objective, okay?
You not only like her, you really like her.</i>

33:44.989 --> 33:47.048
Don't be ridiculous.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.059
What? What's Ziggy got?

33:49.127 --> 33:51.061
I don't know. It needs
a tune-up, this thing.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.097
What do you mean
it needs a tune-up?

33:53.164 --> 33:56.133
Oh, no. Tuna. Tuna?

33:56.200 --> 33:58.794
Oh, there's a school of tuna
just off the reef here. Tuna?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.668
How far out? Ah, a couple hundred
yards just out toward that ship.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.606
Ship!

34:06.110 --> 34:08.304
Sam, there's a ship! My flare.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.574
I gotta get my flare. Here
it is. You got a flare?

34:10.648 --> 34:12.616
That's great.
The ship'll see ya.

34:15.853 --> 34:19.721
- Okay, Al.
- Okay.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.259
<i>That's great.
Homeward bound.</i>

34:24.362 --> 34:27.228
Nothing's happening
with this flare.

34:28.466 --> 34:31.663
- This is impossible.
- Sam, go say, "Ahoy," or somethin'.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.830
I don't believe this!
Th-That can has got to explode!

34:34.906 --> 34:39.434
- What are you doing now?
- Trying to build up the fire. What do you think I'm trying to do?

34:39.510 --> 34:43.275
Oh. Well, you better hurry up. The ship's
only in range for another 3.6 seconds.

34:44.849 --> 34:47.317
Just-
Two.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.149
One. It's gone.

34:56.726 --> 34:59.491
Aah! Careful, Sam. You're
gonna burn yourself.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.759
That's not that hot. It-
Are you all right?

35:01.833 --> 35:04.324
The flare didn't work.

35:04.402 --> 35:07.132
It's empty.

35:07.205 --> 35:12.336
- Well, didn't it explode?
- It's impossible. H-How could it be empty?

35:12.410 --> 35:16.369
The only way it wouldn't have worked,
is if it was empty before you put it on the fire.

35:17.548 --> 35:21.678
Which means that somebody
must've emptied it.

35:21.752 --> 35:23.686
Well-

35:23.754 --> 35:26.450
Well, this can wasn't empty last night.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.458
It got windy.

35:28.526 --> 35:31.051
<i>Bingo.
Are you telling me...</i>

35:31.129 --> 35:34.189
that you emptied this entire can
of hair spray on your head?

35:34.265 --> 35:38.463
Who are you, the hair-spray police?
This was our only way of being rescued.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.527
I said it was windy.
We're on a deserted island.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.369
Who cares? You were a lot
nicer when we were on the ship.

35:43.441 --> 35:46.672
We weren't shipwrecked then,
and we had plenty of hair spray to spare.

35:46.744 --> 35:49.577
Well, I didn't realize I used so much.
Oh, no.

35:49.647 --> 35:54.550
No, of course not. Because you're a vain,
selfish, self-centered spoiled brat...

35:54.619 --> 35:57.554
who doesn't give a damn
about anybody but herself.

35:57.622 --> 36:02.256
What?

36:04.595 --> 36:07.393
I've been a woman, Al.

36:07.465 --> 36:10.923
I mean, I was a beauty queen.
I was even pregnant. Right? And?

36:11.002 --> 36:15.166
And nothing
- nothing has prepared me for a woman like that.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.230
You gotta get me out
of this leap, fast.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.299
Well, I'm doing everything I can.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.346
I got the programmers and the analysts-
They're workin' around the clock.

36:22.413 --> 36:26.042
Of course, some of them are still a
little trashed from Tina's party. Oh, fine.

36:26.117 --> 36:29.883
But they're doing the best they
can. Well, tell 'em to do better.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.888
I knew it.
You knew what?

36:31.956 --> 36:34.424
You got a thing for this girl.
I don't have a thing.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.722
You do. I do not. For
Princess Pain in the Buffalo?

36:36.794 --> 36:40.127
Princess What the What?
Oh, Princess Pain in the Buffalo...

36:40.198 --> 36:42.325
is what the kids in her summer camp
nicknamed her,

36:42.400 --> 36:44.493
and I can't imagine why.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.867
You mean she told you that?
Yes, she told me that.

36:46.938 --> 36:50.271
That's a very intimate childhood
detail. Oh, Al. Come on.

36:50.341 --> 36:55.142
Look, I would never dream of sharing what they called me when I was a c
- Never mind.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.376
It just proves that you
care for her a lot. No way.

36:58.449 --> 37:02.647
There's no way she would get this bad under
your skin unless you had feelings for her.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.984
The only feelings I have
for her are homicidal.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.991
It didn't look that way
after the mud fight.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.289
It looked like your lips
were glued together.

37:10.361 --> 37:14.263
You watched?
Mmm. A little peek.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.767
All right. All right. L-

37:18.836 --> 37:21.566
Let's just say that, you know,
hypothetically speaking,

37:21.639 --> 37:26.235
that- that I do, for some strange,
unknown reason,

37:26.310 --> 37:30.406
have feelings for this woman-
Vanessa- person.

37:30.481 --> 37:33.075
Okay, but what about Nikos?

37:33.150 --> 37:36.517
What if he doesn't feel the same way?
Don't you remember what I told you before?

37:36.587 --> 37:39.283
He worships the ground
that she walks on.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.655
The minute he laid eyes on her,

37:41.726 --> 37:45.924
he volunteered to carry her trunks on
board the ship. She had more than one trunk?

37:45.997 --> 37:48.295
Five trunks? She had
five trunks? Five trunks.

37:48.366 --> 37:51.426
And he put a mint on her
pillow every night. Oh.

37:51.502 --> 37:53.800
And don't think that
she didn't notice him.

37:56.340 --> 38:00.709
She did, huh? Yeah, uh, Vanessa
quit smoking three days ago.

38:00.778 --> 38:05.875
So she used sneaking a smoke as an excuse
to follow him down into the engine room.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.887
Unfortunately, uh, she used that bucket with
the dirty diesel rags for an ashtray, and-

38:10.955 --> 38:16.291
Al, I don't get it though. I mean, if-if the two
of them were so hot and heavy, why am I even here?

38:16.360 --> 38:21.229
Because Nikos was such a good navigator that
he got them rescued too soon. Wait a second.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.097
They never had a chance to express
their feelings. Wait a second.

38:24.168 --> 38:28.434
Are you telling me that I'm here
because I'm a lousy sailor? Partly.

38:28.506 --> 38:32.033
Partly? What's the other part?

38:32.109 --> 38:37.206
Uh, well, the other part is getting Vanessa Foster of the Philadelphia Fosters
- Yeah.

38:37.281 --> 38:41.240
To admit that she's in love
with a greasy Greek sailor.

38:44.622 --> 38:46.556
Oh.
Yeah?

38:46.624 --> 38:48.558
Boy.

38:58.235 --> 39:01.295
Been looking for you.

39:09.146 --> 39:12.411
You know, I gotta say,
in spite of all that hair spray,

39:12.483 --> 39:14.747
<i>your hair looks-
really looks great.</i>

39:14.819 --> 39:17.219
I mean, a little stiff, but-

39:19.023 --> 39:20.957
Dave is a lucky guy.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.017
It doesn't matter anymore,
does it?

39:24.095 --> 39:26.029
I'll never see him again.

39:27.465 --> 39:32.801
You don't know that. I mean, true,
nobody can predict the future.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.532
We're gonna die out
here, aren't we? No.

39:36.907 --> 39:40.775
You know,
your grandmama would...

39:40.845 --> 39:44.008
turn right over in her-

39:44.081 --> 39:47.847
She would be very upset
if she heard you talking like that.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.284
I've ruined everything.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.546
Like what?

39:56.460 --> 39:59.258
Only our rescue.
Oh, our rescue.

39:59.330 --> 40:02.493
You know, uh, we saw one ship.
There'll be other ships.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.761
Yeah, but there won't be another flare.

40:04.835 --> 40:07.133
You underestimate Greek ingenuity.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.672
I just never thought I'd die this way.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.833
You're not go-
Would you stop that?

40:11.909 --> 40:15.003
I always pictured myself growing older,

40:15.079 --> 40:17.809
sitting in a rocking chair,

40:19.850 --> 40:22.717
making my grandchildren miserable.

40:24.622 --> 40:28.649
Withholding those little cash bonuses
whenever they got bad report cards?

40:28.726 --> 40:32.492
Grandmama used to do that.
Huh.

40:35.399 --> 40:38.368
There's just so many things
I wanted to do.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.363
I wanted to climb a mountain,

40:43.441 --> 40:48.140
and I wanted to sail the Nile.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.373
I wanna learn how to make
chocolate chip cookies.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.281
Chocolate chip cookies?

40:53.350 --> 40:56.547
I always figured you for
the baked alaska type or something.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.817
I used to go over to
BetsyJohnson's house.

41:01.192 --> 41:05.754
And her mom, she used
to make this tuna casserole...

41:05.830 --> 41:10.290
and bake cookies,
and then she'd let us lick the bowl.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.638
They didn't have nearly
as much as we had,

41:16.640 --> 41:18.972
and yet they were so happy.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.204
Does David make you happy?

41:21.278 --> 41:23.269
Of course he does.

41:24.381 --> 41:26.849
David's wonderful.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.851
My family loves him.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.547
Do you love him?

41:31.622 --> 41:33.817
Well, I'm marrying him, aren't I?

41:33.891 --> 41:37.987
Yeah, but do you love him?
Why are you doing this to me?

41:38.062 --> 41:43.500
Because I wanna make sure you understand that you don't
have to marry somebody because your family likes 'em.

41:43.567 --> 41:47.230
And you really don't have to marry somebody
because he reminds you of your daddy.

41:47.304 --> 41:49.704
It's not like that at all.
I love Daddy.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.776
I mean David.

41:56.981 --> 42:01.975
I just don't wanna die
before I have a chance to live.

42:05.956 --> 42:11.258
You know, sometimes you just-

42:11.328 --> 42:13.523
You have to take the chance.

42:13.597 --> 42:16.191
It's too late.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.733
It's never too late.

42:34.785 --> 42:37.049
This isn't fair.

42:38.322 --> 42:40.256
What about David?

42:40.324 --> 42:43.725
What about Nikos?
I mean- I mean, me?

42:50.568 --> 42:54.800
I can't. I'm saving myself
for my husband.

42:54.872 --> 42:57.636
Right.

42:57.708 --> 43:01.041
You're saving yourself
for your husband, Nikos.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.494
<i>Oh, my God.
Huh?</i>

43:17.561 --> 43:20.997
No. No.
No?

43:21.065 --> 43:23.158
A ship.

43:23.233 --> 43:25.326
A ship! Come on.

43:28.105 --> 43:31.541
Where are you going?
To send an S.O.S.

43:31.609 --> 43:35.170
- Your flare is gone.
- I don't need the flare. They'll be able to see the bonfire.

43:35.245 --> 43:38.373
What bonfire?
The one I'm about to build.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.383
Come on.
Help me with the wood.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.553
I can't.

43:44.788 --> 43:48.781
What do you mean, you can't? You can steam
clams. You can't help build a bonfire? Come on.

43:50.661 --> 43:52.686
I wanted to steam those clams.

43:53.897 --> 43:57.025
And I wanted to empty
that can of hair spray.

44:05.209 --> 44:07.370
You don't want to be rescued, do you?

44:11.382 --> 44:14.146
Sam. Sam, there's a ship.

44:14.218 --> 44:17.051
Sam, there's a ship out there.
Did you see it?

44:17.121 --> 44:21.023
Sa- Sam, do something!

44:21.091 --> 44:25.050
Ask Ziggy what the odds are for Vanessa
and Nikos staying on this island...

44:25.129 --> 44:27.063
<i>and living happily ever after.</i>

44:27.131 --> 44:29.065
Is this some kind of a Greek thing?

44:29.133 --> 44:31.567
Ancient custom.

44:31.635 --> 44:35.401
Hey, this is a first- 100 percent.

44:35.472 --> 44:37.463
So then I'm really here to make sure...

44:37.541 --> 44:41.671
<i>that we stay on this island together.</i>

44:42.913 --> 44:44.904
And I'll make sure
you won't be sorry.

44:44.982 --> 44:48.509
<i>Oh, and Sam.
These are busy bunnies.</i>

44:48.585 --> 44:53.682
They're gonna have six kids by the time
they get picked up in 1965. Six kids.

44:53.757 --> 44:56.351
I'd like that.

44:56.427 --> 44:58.418
I'd like that very much.

45:06.837 --> 45:09.203
Excuse me, Grandmama.

45:17.147 --> 45:19.377
<i>Uh, no, Sam. Sorry.</i>

45:19.450 --> 45:21.475
Uh, Sam, you're outta here.

45:32.029 --> 45:35.157
<i>Dr. Parker. Dr. Phil Parker.</i>

45:35.232 --> 45:38.827
Can you hear him?
He's out there. Who?

45:38.902 --> 45:40.836
Charlie! He's comin' over the wire.

45:40.904 --> 45:44.340
He's gonna kill us all. We gotta get out
of here. He's gonna cut our heads off!

45:44.408 --> 45:47.309
Don't you fight me,
or I'll break your freakin' neck.

45:47.377 --> 45:50.107
- That isn't necessary, is it? Huh?
- Sam. Don't get up.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.341
<i>Why not?
Sam, don't move.</i>

46:02.693 --> 46:04.627
Oh, boy.
