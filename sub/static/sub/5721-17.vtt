Yesha, Yesha,
you're standing, baby.

00:13.570 --> 00:14.832
She's standing up!

00:14.880 --> 00:16.313
Hurry, get in here!

00:16.360 --> 00:17.702
Look at Daddy, look at Daddy,
look at Daddy.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.798
Ah! I got you.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.058
First day of school,
ready to conquer the universe.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.977
Yes, indeed, look at my baby.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.659
My baby girl,
Yesha Dargis.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.802
Yes! Give Daddy a wave.

00:28.850 --> 00:30.283
Yeah, baby.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.104
That's good.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.843
"After passing the medical
college admission test,

Stanford School of Medicine."

00:38.950 --> 00:40.759
But nobody will love me, Dad.

00:40.820 --> 00:43.857
Not with these stupid braces.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.869
Hey. Come here.

00:49.830 --> 00:53.266
Everyone...
will love you, honey,

00:53.310 --> 00:56.131
because you are
the most beautiful girl

00:56.180 --> 00:58.136

00:58.180 --> 01:00.000
Wow.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.789
Hold on, baby.
Look at my little girl

01:01.840 --> 01:04.616
growing up.
Her first prom.

01:04.670 --> 01:06.752
Look at you! You look...
you look gorgeous.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.791
Absolutely stunning.Thank you, Dad.

You look good, too,
young man. You look good.[chuckles]

Okay, Dad, can we go now?All right, hold on. Need a...

01:31.090 --> 01:32.739
[laughs gently]

01:34.090 --> 01:35.785
Did you want a son, Dad,
not a daughter?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.912
No. Why would you
ask me that?

01:39.090 --> 01:40.785
I don't know. _
Boys seem less complicated.

Hmm.

What's that?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.058
Next door.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.829
They're having some problems.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.312
I think he's selling drugs

ALMA HOFF: I sympathize
with Mr. Dargis.

02:37.460 --> 02:40.020
Everyone in this courtroom
sympathizes with a father

who loses
his daughter,

02:41.900 --> 02:43.970
but this billboard
he put up

02:44.030 --> 02:46.544
is intended to maliciously harm
my client's business.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.819
DIANE: No. My client's
intent is simply to ensure

02:49.860 --> 02:51.555
_ that those _

03:03.700 --> 03:05.213
a noun missing?CARY:
Gloria's

03:05.270 --> 03:06.658
is the noun, Your Honor.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.487
Gloria's Guns
is the gun shop that sold

03:09.530 --> 03:12.317
the semiautomatic handgun used
to murder our client's daughter.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.964
Ah. My condolences, sir.

03:14.010 --> 03:16.535
And the billboard is protected
under the First Amendment.No.

03:16.580 --> 03:17.922
It's defamatory, and
we want it taken down.

03:17.980 --> 03:18.924
ABERNATHY: Can you...

03:18.980 --> 03:20.709
show damages?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.490
I've owned Gloria's Guns
for 11 years.

03:23.550 --> 03:25.677
I took it over from my dad
when he passed.And did your store

03:25.720 --> 03:29.281
murder Yesha Dargis?No.

03:29.330 --> 03:32.208
I'm sorry, sir. My brother died
after he got back from Iraq.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.206
I know what it's like
to lose a loved one.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.423
But no.Have you or
your store

03:36.470 --> 03:39.428
ever been prosecuted or
even fined in connection

03:39.480 --> 03:41.345
with unlawful gun sales?No.

03:41.390 --> 03:44.177
And has this billboard had
an impact on your business?

03:44.220 --> 03:48.213
It has. There are protesters
outside of my shop every day,

03:48.270 --> 03:49.783
trying their best
to shut me down.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.525
Are you aware that,
in the past five years,

03:51.570 --> 03:54.357
over 3,000 guns
used in crimes

03:54.400 --> 03:56.356
have been traced
back to your store?

03:56.410 --> 03:57.661
I've heard that number.

03:57.710 --> 03:59.575
But it's not the shop.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.313
It's the neighborhood I'm in.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.622
Would I rather move
to a better neighborhood?

04:03.670 --> 04:06.104
Yes, but I can't afford
the rent.Aren't there

04:06.150 --> 04:07.799
a lot of people who shop
at Gloria's Guns

04:07.850 --> 04:10.637
because you have a reputation
of turning a blind eye

04:10.680 --> 04:12.591

Argumentative.

Yes, sustained.

to influence your impartiality.What? No.

I'm trying to insist
on your impartiality.Come on.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.395
"We know _

04:30.440 --> 04:32.522
there one iota
of untruth in that?ABERNATHY: Okay, no.

04:32.570 --> 04:35.562
Thank you. My impartiality
is my own concern.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.656
But thank you. Now,

04:37.710 --> 04:39.439
even if there were
3,000 gun deaths

04:39.490 --> 04:41.219
associated with these guns,

04:41.280 --> 04:43.498
how is the billboard
not defamatory?CARY: Your Honor,

04:43.540 --> 04:47.658
truth is an absolute defense
against defamation.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.325
You're submitting that
the statement on the billboard

04:50.370 --> 04:52.452

04:52.500 --> 04:54.548
ifI may have a moment.

04:54.590 --> 04:55.454
Yes. Please.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.239
I thought we decided

04:57.290 --> 04:58.461
to argue opinion.

04:58.510 --> 05:00.421
It gives us more flexibility.Truth

05:00.470 --> 05:03.382
is stronger. And Abernathy
wants to be on our side.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.386
Well, then...
ask for a recess.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.478
We need Jason to pivot.

How's it goin'?

05:20.490 --> 05:23.448
All right, when?

05:23.490 --> 05:26.539
I thought we were
going for opinion.

05:26.580 --> 05:31.017
Got it. Diane, can you
hold on for one second?

05:32.020 --> 05:33.669
Grow up.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.847
[snorts, laughs][phone ringing]

05:35.900 --> 05:38.027
Go.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.556
Hey, Eli. What's up?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.556
All right, I'll go by Gloria's.
What do you think you need?

05:45.600 --> 05:48.251
I don't know. Um...There have been no citations

05:48.300 --> 05:49.813

That much I know.
But, no, let me dig deeperI'll come by

Wait, what?

Who else is testifying?

Lloyd Garber.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.430
Peter's donor?
That can't be good.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.355
What can he say?

06:02.400 --> 06:04.129
Well, that's what I'm gonna try
and find out.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.738
Do you still have that way

06:05.800 --> 06:07.745
to find it out?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.052
Yes.ALICIA:
So what do you need from me?

06:10.100 --> 06:12.660
The prosecutor's gonna force you
to invoke privilege.Seriously?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.324
Yeah. We tried
to negotiate a nonappearance,

06:14.370 --> 06:16.099
but he wouldn't bite, so...

06:16.150 --> 06:17.674
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.768
Uh, tell her
what you want.

Can you...

06:21.590 --> 06:23.638
There you go.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.762
Mrs. Florrick,

06:25.820 --> 06:28.505
how are you doing?I'm good. So he wants to drag me

06:28.560 --> 06:30.334
in front of the grand jury?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.119
Yes. To my mind, it's
a strategic mistake.

06:32.170 --> 06:33.728
Herookae

06:33.780 --> 06:36.476
a bully asking you
over and over to invoke

06:36.520 --> 06:38.602
spousal privilege.
I urge you not to get angry.

06:38.650 --> 06:41.118
Don't show any
impatience. Smile.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.008
from you just once?

06:45.050 --> 06:46.779
On advice of counsel, I invoke

06:46.840 --> 06:50.833
my spousal privilege not...
Could you hold on for a minute?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.538
...to answer any
of your questions.Good.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.625
That sounded good.

06:57.670 --> 06:59.399
Like you're somewhere else.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.939
[beeping]Thank you. Uh, Mike,
that's my call waiting.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.847
I have to get it.Oh, come on.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.458
Grace. Hi. Did you find out?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.764
Well, maybe it's
a deferred admittance.

07:10.820 --> 07:12.594
[whispers]:
College.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.426
Did you check
the Web site?

07:14.470 --> 07:16.643
No, that's the thing.
Mr. Ecklund,

07:16.690 --> 07:19.864
my guidance counselor, he called
their admissions office.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.639
Mom,

07:21.700 --> 07:24.476
the admissions office thinks
that I plagiarized my essay.

07:24.530 --> 07:25.599
What?!

07:25.660 --> 07:28.174
[indistinct chatter]

07:46.940 --> 07:50.114
FOX:
You are Peter Florrick's
largest finanCIal supporter.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.116
You've given Mr. Florrick
and his campaign

07:52.160 --> 07:54.628
over a million dollars.GARBER:
I was happy to do It.

07:54.690 --> 07:57.853
FOX:
I'm sure. When Peter Florrick
was state's attorney,

07:57.910 --> 08:00.731
did you ever ask him
to intervene in the murder trial

08:00.780 --> 08:03.123
of your son, Richard Locke?

08:03.170 --> 08:06.435
I want to be clear:
that has nothing to do

08:06.480 --> 08:09.347
with why I supported Peter
Florrick in the first place.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.209
I believed in
his candidacy.

08:11.270 --> 08:12.919
Of course, Mr. Garber.
That's understood.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.438
But things changed when your son

08:15.490 --> 08:17.390
was charged with murder,
didn't they?Richie

08:17.450 --> 08:18.963
was facing murder charges.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.750
I told Peter I didn't want
my son going to jail.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.667
And what did Mr. Florrick say?He said, "You have
nothing to worry about."

08:24.720 --> 08:26.847
We were sitting in his office,
and Peter looked me in the eye

08:26.890 --> 08:28.846
and said, "Lloyd,
you know how much

08:28.890 --> 08:30.585
"I count on your support.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.244
You have nothing
to worry about."

08:32.290 --> 08:34.064
And you took this to mean...

08:34.120 --> 08:36.680
Peter was going
to protect Richard.And he did.

08:36.730 --> 08:39.506
By engineering a mistrial.MAN: Seriously?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.428
I'm sorry, what?

08:42.470 --> 08:44.688
MAN:
I said, "Seriously?"

08:44.740 --> 08:47.254
It just seems
pretty convenient,

08:47.300 --> 08:49.780
Florrick admitting
exactly what you need him to.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.388
Mr. Garber is giving

08:51.440 --> 08:54.170
sworn testimony.That he practiced.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.871
But see if he remembers
anything else that clearly.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.002
What did you have
for lunch last Tuesday?Oh, my God...

08:59.060 --> 09:01.528
FOX: Uh, you-you don't have
to answer that, Mr. Garber.Oh, my God.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.093
You said we could ask
anything we want.

09:03.150 --> 09:04.708
_ Yes. _
Anything relevant, Sll‘.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.182
Why isn't this
relevant?

09:06.240 --> 09:07.889
We've been listening
to all your questioning.

09:07.930 --> 09:09.363
Now I have
a question.

09:09.410 --> 09:12.368
[murmuring]Okay. Wait, okay!
Yes.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.285
It's a legitimate question.Thank you,

Mr. Meade.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.286
It's time to take a break.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.989
Let's all reconvene in one hour.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.498
Oh, my God.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.778
Genuine Thought is a database
with millions of essays.

09:24.820 --> 09:27.732
It helps schools
identify possible plagiarism.

09:27.780 --> 09:31.739
Mr. Ecklund,
have you read Grace's essay?I have.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.522
So then you know
that this is intensely personal.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.697
Do you seriously think
that other essays

09:36.750 --> 09:39.389
in that database contain
the same family history?

09:39.440 --> 09:41.396
Mrs. Florrick, many students
write about the challenges

09:41.450 --> 09:44.965
they've overcome. And while the
specific facts may be unique,

09:45.010 --> 09:46.966
the lessons that applicants say

09:47.020 --> 09:49.409
they've learned
from them aren't.

09:49.450 --> 09:51.406
I didn't plagiarize.

09:51.460 --> 09:55.237
Mr. Ecklund, could you tell us
exactly what Grace is being

09:55.290 --> 09:57.713
accused of plagiarizing?I can't say.

09:57.770 --> 09:58.976
We-we weren't given
that information.Ah.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.986
Well, who was given
that information?

10:01.030 --> 10:03.988
College admissions.I'd like to speak to them.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.942
[indistinct chatter]

10:06.990 --> 10:07.945
I'm not getting
into college.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.946
Yes, you are.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.945
How?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.774
Software.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.821
It makes mistakes.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.789
It was a fight next door.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.390
Um, over drugs.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.613
They shot at each other, and...

10:28.320 --> 10:29.878
...and one bullet
hit my daughter.

10:29.930 --> 10:34.139
CARY: What happened
to the man who shot her?

10:34.190 --> 10:36.454
He's in jail. They caught him
on security video.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.674
And why do you blame
Gloria's Guns?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.678
The gun used
to kill my daughter,

10:42.720 --> 10:45.507
it was traced back to her shop.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.074
She sold it to a straw buyer.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.204
And what does that mean,
"straw buyer"?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.810
Someone who buys a gun

10:53.870 --> 10:55.815
and then they sell it
to another person

10:55.870 --> 10:57.690
who couldn't have bought it.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.219
Who wouldn't have passed
a background check.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.478
And it's-it's illegal
and they do it all the time.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.135
The cops don't stop 'em,
the Feds don't stop 'em...

11:04.180 --> 11:05.829
I want to stop 'em.I don't blame you, sir.

11:05.880 --> 11:06.869
Thank you, Harry.

11:10.190 --> 11:11.748
[sighs]

11:11.800 --> 11:14.928
I am deeply sorry for
your loss, Mr. Dargis.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.973
What was the name of the man
who shot your daughter?

11:18.020 --> 11:19.100
Antoine Devlin.

11:21.020 --> 11:22.578
No further questions.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.720
Your Honor, the billboard states

11:26.770 --> 11:28.544
"Gloria's murdered my daughter."

11:28.600 --> 11:29.897
And yet Mr. Dargis himself

11:29.950 --> 11:32.020
has just acknowledged that
that isn't true.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.207
In fact, the person that
Gloria's sold the gun to

11:34.250 --> 11:35.899
didn't even do it.

11:35.950 --> 11:37.736
You're saying the causal
connection was broken.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.031
Not just me.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.729
The justice system
has determined

11:40.780 --> 11:41.997
who murdered Yesha Dargis.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.917
He's behind bars.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.996
Uh, Your Honor,
the statement on the billboard

11:46.050 --> 11:49.656
is defensible in a defamation
action as opinion.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.611
Those aren't two
different defenses;

11:51.660 --> 11:52.911
those are two
conflicting defenses.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.759
Although Mr. Dargis
has my sympathies,

11:59.800 --> 12:01.848
he didn't put up
a billboard saying

12:01.890 --> 12:05.018
that "Gloria's _
outrageous busmess practices"

12:05.070 --> 12:07.026
led to his daughter's death.

12:07.070 --> 12:09.675
The billboard, as is,

12:09.720 --> 12:12.029
is defamatory
and must come down.

12:12.070 --> 12:13.765
And then there's
the matter of damages.Your Honor,

12:13.820 --> 12:15.765
may I point out the perversity

12:15.820 --> 12:17.902
of a victim of gun violence

12:17.950 --> 12:19.645
being forced to pay

12:19.690 --> 12:22.420
while the seller
of the gun profits?You may.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.641
_ Please return
With your arguments

12:24.700 --> 12:26.691
as to a damage amount.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.049
[gavel bangs]That was a mistake.

12:29.090 --> 12:30.785
We should have kept arguing
for "opinion."

12:30.830 --> 12:33.526
And it would have had
the same result.

12:39.880 --> 12:40.835
You're late.

12:40.890 --> 12:41.834
I have a life.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.539
What's wrong?

12:43.580 --> 12:45.582
We're changing strategy for
your grand jury deposition.

12:45.630 --> 12:46.938
Okay.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.493
Without pressing Mr. Gold

12:48.550 --> 12:50.495
to share how he has acquired
this knowledge,

12:50.550 --> 12:52.541
he believes there is
one grand jury member

12:52.590 --> 12:56.287
who is incredulous
about the prosecutor's case.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.025
Now, that of course is
not enough to head off
an indictment--

12:59.080 --> 13:02.243
we need 12 jurors
to vote a No Bill.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.598
But where there is one,
others may follow.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.118
So you want me not
to invoke spousal privilege?

13:07.170 --> 13:09.035
This juror thinks
Lloyd Garber is lying,

13:09.090 --> 13:11.172
that he could never
remember a damning
conversation with Peter.

13:11.220 --> 13:15.008
So you want me to try to talk to
this juror's doubts without...

13:15.050 --> 13:16.961
seeming to?Yes.

13:17.010 --> 13:20.093
Any thoughts on how to do that?

13:20.140 --> 13:21.698
No idea.

13:24.150 --> 13:25.833
Okay.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.881
Let's go for it.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.818
[indistinct chatter,
phones ringing]

13:47.040 --> 13:49.031
[wheels squeaking,
cart rattling]

13:53.830 --> 13:55.081
Hey.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.348
Hey.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.742
Oh, why so down?

13:58.790 --> 14:01.964
Turn that frown
upside down.Go to hell.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.784
You're very cheerful.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.535
I'm liking it here.

14:07.230 --> 14:09.278
I need an office.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.491
This is crazy.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.405
Take that one.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.496
I can't just take an office.Sure you can.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.882
Hey.You're gonna
get me fired.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.896
Hey.What's going on?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.237
We want to steal an office.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.894
I thought you were out
grand jurying.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.248
Tomorrow. They delayed it.

14:22.290 --> 14:23.507
Uh, what do you mean,
steal an office?

14:23.550 --> 14:24.812
I told her
she should take

14:24.860 --> 14:26.248
that one.Well, whose is it?

14:26.300 --> 14:27.904
Lucca's.No.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.383
No one's.[phone rings]

14:29.430 --> 14:31.034
Lucca Quinn.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.427

Okay. On my way up.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.436

14:38.480 --> 14:40.129
Don't move me.

14:44.310 --> 14:47.928

She's not happy, is she?Not much.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.575
We came in as peers,
and I get the office,

14:50.620 --> 14:52.622
she gets the cubicle.Right.

14:52.670 --> 14:53.887
I need to hire you
freelance.

14:53.930 --> 14:56.535
Is this another subject?Yes.

14:56.590 --> 14:57.932
It's something personal.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.709
Your husband?No, my daughter.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.149
Oh, my God.
My family needs

15:02.200 --> 15:04.543
a full-time investigator--
that's not normal, is it?

15:04.590 --> 15:06.023
Sure it is.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.549
What's the issue?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.465
Have you ever heard
of a software

15:09.510 --> 15:12.638
called genuinethought.com?

15:13.690 --> 15:16.602
Her business is up almost 20%

15:16.650 --> 15:19.562
year to date.So good, there are no damages.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.431
CARY: She'll say her business
would be up even more--
gun business is booming.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.267
I agree-- they're trying
to make an example out of this.

15:25.310 --> 15:27.619
Take on the gun industry
and we'll make you pay.

15:27.660 --> 15:31.744
I wish I could sue for
how much money I've
lost on my business.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.665
What do you mean?

15:33.710 --> 15:35.621
My motel.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.752
Every time there's a new story
about the gun violence,

15:37.800 --> 15:40.792
I lose reservations.LUCCA: Well,
why can't you try to recover?

15:40.850 --> 15:43.148
CARY: No. The Protection of
Lawful Commerce in Arms Act

15:43.200 --> 15:45.236
is the problem-- it makes
it impossible to recover

15:45.290 --> 15:48.589
against anyone in
the gun industry.No one has tried civil claims

15:48.640 --> 15:50.028
tied to tourism.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.459
So, y... I'm sorry, what?

15:54.510 --> 15:56.683
We are countersuing
for damages, Your Honor.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.198
Really? How does thatwork?Your Honor, did you want to know

15:59.260 --> 16:00.420
how that works?I do, thank you.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.345
The plaintiff here
can't show losses.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.429
But our client can.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.744
Mr. Dargis owns a motel
in the neighborhood,

16:08.790 --> 16:12.521
and his losses are directly
related to the increase
in gun Violence.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.094
Excuse me, but congress has
made this kind of lawsuit

16:15.140 --> 16:16.448

I'm not.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.310
That's a sign of growth, right?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.749
Or something.Scar tissue.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.791
Maturity.

20:00.850 --> 20:02.579
Cynicism.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.359
You expect the
worst in people,

20:04.420 --> 20:07.890
you'll never be
disappointed.Right.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.022
You think this is
the worst of Jason?

20:10.070 --> 20:12.243
No. I didn't say that.

20:12.290 --> 20:15.020
He didn't promise you
anything, right?

20:16.990 --> 20:19.072
He didn't, did he?

20:19.130 --> 20:22.907
No, but I was becoming...

20:22.960 --> 20:24.951
invested.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.252
I liked it.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.608
I liked being with him.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.264
So why can't you
keep it up?

20:31.310 --> 20:32.652
Become another face
in his harem?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.656
Have fun.

20:34.710 --> 20:36.268
Start your own harem.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.619
When you stop having
fun, say good-bye.

20:40.890 --> 20:42.846
Oh, God, this isn't who I am.

20:42.890 --> 20:44.494
You don't know
who you are.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.622
No one knows
who they are.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.806
Talk to Jason.

20:47.850 --> 20:49.898
He likes you.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.852
And maybe it was
just a friend.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.982
Hey.

20:56.030 --> 20:58.203
Hey.[door closes]

20:58.250 --> 21:00.980
So, are we still on for tonight?

21:01.040 --> 21:04.476
Can I...
get back to you on that?

21:04.520 --> 21:05.600
Yeah. Sure.

21:05.650 --> 21:06.776
Grand jury stuff?

21:06.830 --> 21:08.513
Yes. That, too. Right.

21:08.570 --> 21:11.209
All right, so about
what I found out.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.692
Huh?

21:12.740 --> 21:13.786
Your daughter.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.559
Oh. Right.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.702
Dear God, I'm falling apart.

21:17.750 --> 21:20.218
All right, Genuine Thought--
it's big business

21:20.270 --> 21:22.534
in the fight against
student plagiarism.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.832
The software designers
have acknowledged

21:24.890 --> 21:26.972
they're having problems
with false positives,

21:27.020 --> 21:28.328
which is why the
company has settled

21:28.370 --> 21:29.496
a few lawsuits last year.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.849
Wait, false positives how?

21:31.890 --> 21:34.108
It might tag a section
as plagiarism when, in fact,

21:34.160 --> 21:37.800
it's just a phrase
in common usage.
For example,

21:37.860 --> 21:39.851
in one paper they flagged:
"there's not enough money

21:39.900 --> 21:42.505
to go around," or "according
to conventional wisdom"

21:42.560 --> 21:45.779
as plagiarized, when
in fact they're just
sort of clichs.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.811
Unoriginal, but
not plagiarized.

21:47.870 --> 21:50.259
So, what do I do?Well, you need
to find out

21:50.300 --> 21:51.824
what they're saying
is plagiarized.

21:51.870 --> 21:54.179
They won't tell me--
they say it breaks policy.

21:54.220 --> 21:56.268
They don't want more lawsuits.Okay.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.390
Great.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.351
Thanks.
I'll see what I can do.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.262
Hey...

22:02.320 --> 22:05.574
Everything is normal
here, right?

22:07.280 --> 22:08.929
As normal as it can be.

22:08.970 --> 22:10.881
Okay, so then we'll just...

22:10.930 --> 22:12.932
reschedule lunch.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.933
Okay.

22:15.980 --> 22:17.936
Hey, um,
Genuine Thought--

22:17.980 --> 22:21.370
they don't just have contracts
with colleges?

22:21.420 --> 22:23.888
No.So I could
submit something too?

22:25.990 --> 22:28.038

22:29.470 --> 22:32.906
I'm, uh, handing
the Harry redirect to Lucca.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.120
What?

22:34.170 --> 22:35.956
Why?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.389
Well, she knows the business.
And I want to encourage her.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.388
The first weekend of January,
12 people were shot

22:44.450 --> 22:46.395
within five blocks of my motel.

22:46.450 --> 22:49.886
By Monday, 75% of our guests
had checked out early.

22:49.930 --> 22:51.921
And eight parties
canceled their reservations

22:51.970 --> 22:53.710
the following weekend.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.182
Was that atypical?No, that's
been the pattern

22:55.240 --> 22:56.582
more than
the exception.

22:56.630 --> 22:59.542
Shootings,
check-outs, cancellations.

22:59.590 --> 23:00.932
But why are you
blaming Gloria's?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.584
Of the 700 crime guns

23:02.640 --> 23:04.369
traced back to Gloria last year,

23:04.420 --> 23:05.853
more than 200 were linked

23:05.900 --> 23:09.028
to shootings within a mile
of my motel.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.206

Thank you, sir.
And I'm sorry.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.036
HOFF:
Isn't it true you've

23:12.080 --> 23:15.948
received more than 30
one-star Bed & Plate reviews?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.160
Yeah, but Bed & Plate
is a racket.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.869
[chuckles]
That I agree with.

23:18.910 --> 23:20.252
You don't
believe you have

23:20.310 --> 23:22.437
"beds the dead
would complain about"

23:22.480 --> 23:25.392
or "bathrooms reminiscent
of Soldier Field"?

23:25.440 --> 23:26.782
I look at the feedback,
try to fix

23:26.840 --> 23:28.171
any problems
that people point out.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.834
But don't you think
it's conceivable

23:29.880 --> 23:31.666
that those problems
are the direct cause

23:31.710 --> 23:34.099
of your drop in business,
not gun violence?

23:34.150 --> 23:37.187
No, the gun violence hurt my
business, so I had to cut back.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.400
Or were you cutting back
because you were

23:38.460 --> 23:40.109
saving up to buy another motel?

23:40.150 --> 23:41.879
Objection, Your Honor.
Foundation.ABERNATHY: Oh.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.282
I'll sustain that.I think I'm good here.

23:43.330 --> 23:44.581
I'll rest.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.108
Well, we seem to have

23:47.160 --> 23:50.334
a chicken and egg problem here,
and if you're

23:50.380 --> 23:51.938
trying to prove
causation,[phone dings]

23:51.990 --> 23:55.039
that is not good news.
Given that

23:55.080 --> 23:57.605
I cannot find enough evidence
to definitively rule

23:57.650 --> 23:59.470
that Mr. Dargis's
business suffered from

23:59.520 --> 24:00.737
gun violence specifically...

24:00.780 --> 24:03.123
Your Honor,

24:03.180 --> 24:05.478
before you rule...Ms. Lockhart, I feel like
I've been more than fair here.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.430
Absolutely.
Uh, but please,

24:07.480 --> 24:09.357
if you could just grant us
a brief recess,

24:09.400 --> 24:11.004
I believe we can offer you

that you're looking for.

delve into.

I was with anyone?

What did she see?

be upset?

Hello.

26:28.150 --> 26:29.924
Thank you so much
for being here today.

26:29.970 --> 26:33.269
It's not by choice, Mr. Fox.
I was subpoenaed.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.275
Well, thank you anyway.

26:35.330 --> 26:37.286
I don't want to make this
any more confrontational

26:37.330 --> 26:38.638
than it has to be.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.934
So, please, just have
a seat right here.

26:41.990 --> 26:44.550
I have several questions
I think the grand jury

26:44.600 --> 26:46.420
would like to hear
the answers to, um,

26:46.470 --> 26:48.290
but I understand
that you have a right

26:48.340 --> 26:50.126
to invoke spousal privilege.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.865
I do.Good.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.684
I just don't want
the jury to judge you

26:53.740 --> 26:55.640
every time you say "I
invoke spousal privilege

26:55.700 --> 26:57.509
and elect not to
answer the question."

26:57.570 --> 26:58.958
Thank you.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.695
So, members of the grand jury,

27:00.740 --> 27:03.049
please refrain
from any such judgment.

27:03.090 --> 27:04.352
Now I'd like
to turn

27:04.400 --> 27:05.788
to our first question.
[clears throat]

27:05.840 --> 27:07.922
Mrs. Florrick, did your husband

27:07.970 --> 27:09.619
ever make a deal
with Lloyd Garber

27:09.670 --> 27:11.058
to have his
son released

27:11.100 --> 27:13.148
in trade for political
contributions?

27:13.190 --> 27:14.407
No.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.199
Uh... Mrs. Florrick,

27:17.240 --> 27:19.196
just to be clear,
you answered that question.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.753
Yes, I did.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.244
Well, if you
answer this question,

27:23.290 --> 27:26.191
you can't pick and choose when
to invoke spousal privilege.

27:26.250 --> 27:27.672
I know.So...

27:27.730 --> 27:31.461
you... you want
to answer questions?

27:33.340 --> 27:35.808
Yes. That's why I'm here.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.474
That's right. Game on.

27:37.520 --> 27:40.307
One second.
[clears throat]

27:47.310 --> 27:48.481
Mrs. Florrick,
how many times

27:48.530 --> 27:50.043
have you met with Mr. Garber?

27:50.100 --> 27:51.226
Three.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.226
Were these social occasions?They were.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.350
And do you have any reason
to think he would lie

27:55.410 --> 27:57.662
about this deal
he made with your husband?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.052
No.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.806
So, then, he was
telling the truth?

28:01.850 --> 28:04.284
No, I think, uh,

28:04.330 --> 28:06.286
Lloyd Garber
has a very bad memory.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.413
Um...

28:11.600 --> 28:13.420
Okay, let's move on.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.295
Actually, I'm not finished.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.729
Um, he tends to...

28:18.780 --> 28:20.509
forget things, and then...

28:20.560 --> 28:22.118
It's o-it's okay, Mrs. Florrick,
we're moving on.

28:22.170 --> 28:23.478
Don't you want to hear
my answer in full

28:23.520 --> 28:24.737
how Mr. Garber's
faulty memory

28:24.790 --> 28:26.348
could lead
to a falsehood?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.788
No, I'm actually more
interested in the fact...

28:27.830 --> 28:29.172
I want to hear.

28:29.220 --> 28:30.619
Yes!

28:30.660 --> 28:32.525
Uh, sir, please
hold your questions.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.389
I would if you'd
let me ask them.

28:34.450 --> 28:36.099
IfI could continue,
I would probably

28:36.140 --> 28:38.404
be able to satisfy
any questions here.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.623
After I'm finished.
So, let's

28:40.670 --> 28:43.184
talk about this mistrial

28:43.240 --> 28:45.276
of Lloyd Garber's son.
You are aware of it?

28:45.330 --> 28:47.753
I am.And how did you
become aware of it?

28:47.810 --> 28:52.019
Mr. Garber wanted to hire me
recently, as a lavwer,

28:52.070 --> 28:55.949
and he was trying to remember
certain facts about it.

28:55.990 --> 28:58.038
He tends to have
a selective memory...

28:58.080 --> 29:00.116
Mrs. Florrick...I'm sorry,

29:00.170 --> 29:02.900
but don't you want me
to answer these questions?

29:04.740 --> 29:06.298
Mrs. Florrick...

29:06.350 --> 29:07.692
have you ever met with that

29:07.740 --> 29:09.651

29:12.400 --> 29:13.879
You know
that is a Federal offense?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.228
I do.Why don't you

29:15.270 --> 29:17.966
ask me?
I have never met with her.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.789
[indistinct conversations]

29:23.840 --> 29:26.274
You're playing with fire here,
Mr. Tascioni.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.015
You cannot be approaching
grand jurors.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.844
Sorry, what?It is a criminal offense

29:29.890 --> 29:31.892
to discuss an ongoing case
with a grand juror.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.283
Oh, H d...
A-And I-and I am not.

29:34.330 --> 29:38.027
Tom and I have been sitting
here quietly, waiting for...

29:38.080 --> 29:39.468
Mrs. Florrick to exit.[barks]

29:39.510 --> 29:42.070
Tom doesn't like
your accusation either.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.553
Hmph.

29:45.820 --> 29:49.472
So, I imagine
that went well.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.476
It was interesting.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.078
We could win this?

29:53.130 --> 29:54.916
We could.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.875
BOTH:
Your Honor, it's not just...

30:00.920 --> 30:01.875
Perhaps it's one of
the parties.

30:01.930 --> 30:02.874
Uh, ladies first.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.886
It's not just Mr. Dargis's

30:04.930 --> 30:06.090
business that has suffered

30:06.150 --> 30:08.277
due to the actions
of Gloria's Guns.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.140
Rather, a wide
cross-section

30:10.190 --> 30:12.272
of tourism-related
busmesses.

30:12.330 --> 30:15.288
These are 17 Chicago
business owners

30:15.330 --> 30:17.195
who have offered
affidavits

30:17.250 --> 30:19.810
swearing that gun violence
has harmed tourism.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.669
HOFF: Your Honor,
may I call one witness

30:21.730 --> 30:24.460
to rebut these affidavits?

30:24.510 --> 30:27.115
Ms. St. Jean, you are

30:27.170 --> 30:30.162
the chief economist for
the Chicago Chamber of Commerce?

30:30.210 --> 30:32.292
That's right.And you're familiar
with the tourism

30:32.350 --> 30:33.476
statistics for our city?

30:33.520 --> 30:34.475
Intimately.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.862
Tell us about 2015.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.343
Up 3.4% over the
previous year.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.096
We actually set a new record,
topping 50 million visitors.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.482
And the hotel business?

30:42.530 --> 30:44.578
Up over 2014 in
occupancy rates

30:44.620 --> 30:46.315
and average daily rates
on rooms.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.408
Wow, even with the
increased gun violence?

30:48.450 --> 30:50.759
It's a testament
to Chicago's great draw.

30:50.800 --> 30:54.531
Let's talk about
the, uh, numbers again, ma'am.

30:54.590 --> 30:56.273
The visitor numbers to Chicago.

30:56.330 --> 30:57.718
They seem
unusually high.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.022
Chicago is popular.

30:59.070 --> 31:00.230
And getting even
more popular.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.190
Do your visitor numbers

31:02.250 --> 31:04.377
include all traffic

31:04.420 --> 31:05.819
through O'Hare
airport,

31:05.860 --> 31:07.680
regardless of
whether or not

31:07.730 --> 31:09.459
they ever actually
set foot in the city?

31:09.510 --> 31:12.035
You're aware that O'Hare
isthe city.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.422
It's in Chicago.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.254
Well aware. _
That was not my question.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.380
I want to know

31:16.430 --> 31:17.909
if traffic through O'Hare

31:17.960 --> 31:19.211
figures into
your tourism statistics

31:19.260 --> 31:21.080
for Chicago.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.301
That's not something
I can confirm or deny.Sure.

31:23.350 --> 31:26.228
I mean, you're only
the Chief Economist

31:26.270 --> 31:28.135
for Chicago's
Chamber of Commerce.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.919
Objection.Withdrawn.

31:29.970 --> 31:33.144
Don't most large cities measure
tourism or growth of tourism

31:33.190 --> 31:35.442
based on hotel occupancy
rates and rates per day?

31:35.500 --> 31:37.923
I don't know
what most cities do.And yet, uh,

31:37.980 --> 31:39.936
Chicago inflates its numbers

31:39.980 --> 31:42.289
by including people just
passing through the airport,

31:42.330 --> 31:44.844
even if they're just
catching a connecting flight.

31:44.900 --> 31:47.118
Objection.
That wasn't her testimony.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.468
Counsel is assuming facts
not in evidence.

31:48.510 --> 31:51.206
True. Uh, sort of. Uh...

31:51.250 --> 31:52.899
sustained.Okay, well,

31:52.950 --> 31:55.418
the Department of Commerce's
last report

31:55.470 --> 31:57.290
shows international tourism
to Chicago

31:57.350 --> 31:59.341
falling by five percent,

31:59.390 --> 32:00.994
despite the fact
that international visitors

32:01.040 --> 32:02.826
to the United States

32:02.870 --> 32:05.521
increased by
seven percent.I would have to check that.

32:05.570 --> 32:07.003
Do you think that might
have something to do with

32:07.050 --> 32:08.221
how many more
shootings have occurred

32:08.270 --> 32:11.319
between now
and then?

32:11.360 --> 32:14.272
The similarities were _
far from vague, Mrs. Florrick.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.015
Then tell us what they are.
What is my daughter

32:16.060 --> 32:17.186
accused of plagiarizing?

32:17.230 --> 32:19.369
Unfortunately, it is
our college policy

32:19.410 --> 32:21.366
to not reveal the details
of these decisions.

32:21.410 --> 32:22.809
You're worried
about a lawswt?

32:22.850 --> 32:24.408
We're worried about
confidentiality.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.234
I'm a lawyer, ma'am.
If there's anyone

32:26.290 --> 32:28.190
you should be worried about,
it's a lawyer.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.194
And if there's anyone
you should worry about

32:29.250 --> 32:31.548
not intimidating, it's a college

32:31.600 --> 32:34.023
admissions director.Well, good. I think that settles
the matter. Why don't we...

32:34.080 --> 32:36.378
So here's the thing:
We submitted my Grace's essayOkay.

32:36.430 --> 32:39.297
independenﬂy,
to Genuine Thought,

32:39.340 --> 32:41.251
to find out what
they considered plagiarism,

32:41.300 --> 32:42.904
and do you know
what they flagged?

32:42.960 --> 32:46.339
"Do not take an oath
by your head, for you cannot

32:46.390 --> 32:49.006
make one hair white or black."

32:49.050 --> 32:50.392
Again, I can not tell you.

32:50.440 --> 32:51.998
It's from
the Sermon on the Mount.

32:52.050 --> 32:53.358
You're accusing my daughter
of plagiarizing

32:53.400 --> 32:56.221
the Sermon on the... Mount.

32:56.270 --> 32:59.398
I can not confirm or deny.Do you seriously
want to be sued for denying

32:59.450 --> 33:02.533
my daughter admittance because
you can't tell the difference

33:02.580 --> 33:06.016
between _the Sermon on the Mount
Within or Without quotes?

33:07.330 --> 33:10.026
It was very nice
meeting you, ma'am.

33:13.330 --> 33:15.798
Well, I think
we should leave it at that.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.294
Oh, like hell.

33:18.340 --> 33:20.513
Uh-oh.

33:23.390 --> 33:26.518
What are you
doing here?
I've been called
back to the Grand Jury,

33:26.560 --> 33:29.040
but I assume you know that.I hadn't heard anything.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.479
Alicia thought she'd
answered all the questions.Well, they had more.

33:31.530 --> 33:33.998
Mr. Garber, we're ready.

33:35.270 --> 33:37.522
[clears his throat]

33:39.450 --> 33:41.099
That's not a good sign.

33:41.140 --> 33:42.789
No.

33:42.840 --> 33:43.886
I'll be right back.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.379
[knocking on door]

33:58.420 --> 34:00.468
It's unlocked. Come on in.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.424
Oh.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.687
I thought you were Lucca.

34:12.090 --> 34:15.082
You want, uh...
you want me to come back?

34:15.140 --> 34:17.392
No.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.431
I'm eating pizza.

34:19.490 --> 34:23.130
That is the saddest piece
of pizza I've ever seen.

34:23.190 --> 34:27.627
Yes, like Charlie Brown's
Christmas tree.

34:27.670 --> 34:30.138
I'm not even hungry.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.536
So...

34:33.590 --> 34:35.933
So.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.418
I think...

34:39.460 --> 34:41.849
I think that I offended you.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.982
Yeah.

34:44.030 --> 34:46.294
I met an old friend
at Avenue Tavern.

34:46.340 --> 34:48.114
Jason, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.330
I'm an adult.

34:49.390 --> 34:51.688
I know it may not
look like it from...

34:51.740 --> 34:54.163
this pizza...

34:54.220 --> 34:56.438
but I am.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.732
And I am not
under the impression

34:58.790 --> 35:01.782
that we committed
to each other, or...

35:01.830 --> 35:04.879
have expressed... vows,

35:04.920 --> 35:06.399
or are going steady, or...She's a friend from New York

35:06.450 --> 35:07.610
that I haven't seen in a while.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.138
Seriously, Jason, I'm fine.

35:10.190 --> 35:14.058
I'm here and thrilled
that you stopped by,

35:14.110 --> 35:15.589
and thrilled that we're talking.

35:15.630 --> 35:20.238
And I do not need
some profession of faith.

35:20.290 --> 35:23.635
You don't need a ticket
to get through that door there.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.240
It didn't mean anything.You're still explaining.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.760
I... am married.

35:29.820 --> 35:32.778
If anyone should be explaining,

35:32.820 --> 35:36.210
it should be me.

35:43.090 --> 35:45.524
So I...

35:45.570 --> 35:49.188
I came here With this... plan.

35:49.230 --> 35:52.666
And now I...

35:52.710 --> 35:55.144
I don't know what I should do.

35:55.190 --> 35:58.011
You should come around
the island and kiss me.

35:58.060 --> 36:02.099
That's What this is called?
An island?

36:02.160 --> 36:06.199
Yes. Come here.

36:26.610 --> 36:29.966
What if I'm jealous
of your husband?

36:30.010 --> 36:32.649
Don't be.

36:32.710 --> 36:34.962
Okay.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.534
My daughter's home
in 45 minutes.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.751
[sighs]

36:43.810 --> 36:46.540
Okay, but I
can't lift you.

36:46.590 --> 36:48.672
I threw out my back.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.893
[laughing]

36:58.040 --> 37:00.554
What else do you need, ma'am?Oh, it's not about what I need.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.216
You said you cross-referenced
Grace's essay with 750,000

37:03.260 --> 37:05.080
other student
college essays?

37:05.130 --> 37:07.781
That is correct, through
the Genuine Thought software.

37:07.830 --> 37:09.218
Well, you know the one thing
they didn't do?

37:09.270 --> 37:11.738
I have no idea, ma'am.

37:11.790 --> 37:14.611
They didn't acquire the IP
rights to those 750,000 essays.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.002
What are you saying?

37:16.050 --> 37:17.267
They advertised

37:17.320 --> 37:19.276
that they had access to
these essays.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.311
But unfortunately, you need the
intellectual property rights.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.180
And you know what?

37:23.240 --> 37:24.309
I'm going.They need the rights.

37:24.370 --> 37:26.361
So you're subject to suit, too.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.015
And I'm gonna start
rounding out a class action suit

37:29.070 --> 37:30.765
to end all class actions suits,

37:30.810 --> 37:32.584
because you've pissed off
a lot of essay writers.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.982
[clears throat]
Um, do-do you...

37:34.030 --> 37:35.019
do you want us
to get out of here?

37:35.070 --> 37:36.765
No.

37:36.810 --> 37:38.289
I think we're close
to a deCI5ion, aren't we, Amy?

37:42.730 --> 37:44.129
You decided it, Mom.

37:44.170 --> 37:45.990
I decided what?

37:46.040 --> 37:47.029
The law.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.648
It's What I'm doing.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.785
[laughs]

37:53.830 --> 37:55.172
Okay. Please.

37:55.220 --> 37:57.700
[gallery murmurs,
then quiets]

37:57.750 --> 37:59.832
I am appalled by the escalation

37:59.880 --> 38:01.222
of gun violence in this city,

38:01.270 --> 38:02.578
and I agree With the plaintiff

38:02.620 --> 38:04.929
that the PLCAA
is too far-reaching.

38:04.970 --> 38:07.188
Were I a senator
or a congressman,

38:07.240 --> 38:08.537
I would strive to repeal it.

38:08.590 --> 38:12.196
But I am... a judge.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.549
And it is my job
to rule according

38:14.590 --> 38:17.980
to the laws we have, not
the laws I wish we had.[whispers]: I'm sorry.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.338
Although plaintiff's argument
was admirable,

38:19.380 --> 38:21.723
I find you were unable

38:21.770 --> 38:24.034
to make a direct
causal connection

38:24.080 --> 38:26.389
between gun sales
by Gloria's Guns

38:26.430 --> 38:28.079
and a reduction
in tourism

38:28.130 --> 38:30.826
that affected damage to
any particular business.

38:30.870 --> 38:34.385
Your Honor, we intend to appeal.Do you mind if I finish first?

38:34.440 --> 38:36.214
I find for the defense.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.353
No damages are due Mr. Dargis.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.222
I'm sorry, sir. I sympathize,
but the laW is the law.

38:43.270 --> 38:46.398
I award damages
to Gloria's Guns.

38:46.450 --> 38:49.533
I believe that their business
was adversely impacted

38:49.580 --> 38:51.059
by this billboard.

38:51.110 --> 38:52.759
I order that the sign

38:52.800 --> 38:56.236
be taken down, and for every day
that the sign is not taken down,

38:56.290 --> 38:58.360
Mr. Dargis will pay
to Gloria's Guns

38:58.420 --> 39:01.378
a cash penalty of ten cents.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.501
Excuse me?Do you understand
What I'm saying, Mr. Dargis?

39:06.560 --> 39:09.643
If you want to keep
your billboard up, you must pay

39:09.690 --> 39:12.341
this court ten cents
for every Single day.
HOFF:
Your Honor,

39:12.390 --> 39:13.903
tha_t's offensive.
My client's busmess

39:13.960 --> 39:15.689
has been affected.Well, yes, and she deserves

39:15.740 --> 39:18.436
ten cents for every single day.HARRY: Your Honor,

39:18.480 --> 39:19.651
uh, can I pay now?

39:19.700 --> 39:20.689
If you so wish, sir.

39:20.740 --> 39:22.219
1-1... I have $40.

39:22.270 --> 39:23.305
Okay.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.351
That will give you 400 more days

39:25.400 --> 39:27.129
of your sign being up.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.875
Your Honor,
this invites chaos.
No.

39:29.930 --> 39:32.535
Your _client has_
a very profitable busmess.

39:32.580 --> 39:34.571
She doesn't want to look
at a victim's face?

39:34.630 --> 39:36.495
Well, that's too bad.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.189
She's going to have to.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.708
That's it.[gavel bangs]

39:40.760 --> 39:42.409
[laughing]

39:42.460 --> 39:44.928
Wow.
Oh.

39:46.470 --> 39:47.596
Thank you.

39:48.730 --> 39:51.039
Wow. I think your office

39:51.080 --> 39:53.423
has more square footage
than mine.

39:53.470 --> 39:54.903
I feel like I've arrived.

39:54.950 --> 39:57.032
You look it.
Put your feet up.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.160
[laughs]

39:59.220 --> 40:00.778
Are the associates
still hating you?

40:00.830 --> 40:02.388
Let's see.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.000
Hey, Bob!

40:05.050 --> 40:07.041
No, they've
come around.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.523
Hey, Jason's coming.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.571
You both all right?I think we are.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.499
You talked?
JASON:
Wow.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.667
Nice office.
Thanks.

40:17.710 --> 40:20.452
We're gonna go celebrate my
promotion. You want to come?

40:20.500 --> 40:22.934
No.
It seems like a girl thing.

40:22.980 --> 40:24.288
We'll make an allowance.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.025
Okay, then, yeah.

40:26.070 --> 40:27.412
Alicia...

40:30.680 --> 40:32.022
Hey, Cary.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.116
Everything all right?I don't know.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.422
Pretty fast for an
associate to get an office,

40:36.470 --> 40:38.859
isn't it?
Lucca's good.

40:38.910 --> 40:40.605
Seems like yesterday
When we were.

40:40.650 --> 40:42.641
[chuckles]

40:42.700 --> 40:44.952
So, I have to ask... [sighs]

40:45.000 --> 40:46.479
Did Diane approach you about

40:46.530 --> 40:49.306
making this an all-female
firm, pushing me out?

40:49.350 --> 40:52.092
Did Diane?
Yeah.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.401
No, she didn't.

41:01.370 --> 41:03.668
[crowd chatter and laughter]

41:05.410 --> 41:08.026
You two look like
you want to be home.

41:08.070 --> 41:10.379
Are you kidding?No.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.335
I want some chips.

41:17.380 --> 41:19.428
I'll get 'em.
No. No.

41:19.470 --> 41:21.904
You stay.

41:29.350 --> 41:31.602
[whispering]

41:35.400 --> 41:39.837
Oh, my God, Mrs. Florrick,
the mouth on you.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.223
It's one of my best features.

41:42.280 --> 41:45.886
Oneof your best, not
the absolute best.

41:45.930 --> 41:48.239
Mm-hmm.

41:53.110 --> 41:54.247
[sighs]

41:54.290 --> 41:57.851
We are in public.

41:57.900 --> 42:01.370
You are a constant
source of surprise.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.556
I wasted the last 20 years.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.989
I'm not gonna waste
the next 20.

42:08.910 --> 42:13.301
It's on the front page
of the Sun-Times.

42:13.350 --> 42:16.308
The governor's Wife
was arrested

42:16.350 --> 42:19.353
for performing a lewd act
on an employee.

42:19.400 --> 42:24.008
After the act was described,
finally they all agreed...

42:24.060 --> 42:25.357
