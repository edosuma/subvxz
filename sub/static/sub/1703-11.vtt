00:27.861 --> 00:29.796
This was an act of terrorism.

00:29.831 --> 00:32.299
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:32.335 --> 00:34.170
<i>The next number</i>

00:34.204 --> 00:36.005

...until something stops him.

00:38.476 --> 00:41.278
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:41.312 --> 00:44.849

<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:46.219 --> 00:48.486
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:48.521 --> 00:52.189
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:58.828 --> 01:01.297
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:01.332 --> 01:03.299
God!

01:03.333 --> 01:05.302
<i>Fuck! I missed</i>

01:05.336 --> 01:08.073

I <i> can't </i> let that happen again.

01:09.376 --> 01:11.510

Representative Richard Johnson
mean anything to you?

01:52.825 --> 01:54.559
I watch the news.

01:54.594 --> 01:56.829
How would you feel about running
for his seat in

01:56.863 --> 01:58.231
the upcoming special election?

01:58.265 --> 02:00.000
I'm interested.

02:00.034 --> 02:03.838
A political office?
What are you talking about?

02:03.872 --> 02:06.074
I don't want to do it if there's
even a chance

02:06.109 --> 02:07.543
the media would find out about us.

02:13.589 --> 02:15.757
Who are you? You're CIA?

02:15.792 --> 02:18.560
What's the tradecraft for
setting a meeting with Walker?

02:18.595 --> 02:21.563
I put my child's drawing

02:27.136 --> 02:28.102
So, I'm bait?

02:29.328 --> 02:30.680
It could be Walker.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.605
It's hard to tell.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.673
I can't see his face.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.008
I need visual confirmation.

02:34.042 --> 02:35.609
He's approaching Al Zahrani.

02:35.643 --> 02:37.595
Saul, what's in
the fucking briefcase?!

The President's a busy man, David.

04:36.961 --> 04:38.561
He wants his helicopter ungrounded.

04:38.596 --> 04:39.929
Not when we're seeing
increased chatter

04:39.964 --> 04:41.397
with references to Marine One.

04:41.431 --> 04:42.899
He's been briefed,
it doesn't faze him.

04:42.933 --> 04:44.167
Well, tell him it should.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.235
I did.
So?

04:45.269 --> 04:46.937
So he's the leader

04:46.971 --> 04:48.505
of the free world, David.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.274
He doesn't enjoy looking like
some impotent asshole,

04:50.309 --> 04:52.810
which is how this guy Walker's
making us all look.

04:52.845 --> 04:54.579
He'll look even worse
if his helicopter gets

04:54.614 --> 04:56.515
blown out of the sky.
Tell him that.

05:04.223 --> 05:05.923
What have we got?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.157
16 agencies.

05:07.192 --> 05:08.525
You are kidding me.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.828
Nope.

05:11.862 --> 05:13.296
16 agencies had some awareness

05:13.330 --> 05:14.998
of our operation to get Walker.

05:15.032 --> 05:16.832
And that's just on
the intelligence side.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.367
So how do I find the leak?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.437
You can start by looking around you.

05:20.471 --> 05:22.638
Goddamn it.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.509
Sir.
Yeah?

05:25.543 --> 05:27.310
The Vice President wants to see you.

05:27.345 --> 05:29.146
He's here?
No, sir.

05:29.180 --> 05:31.315
Succession protocol requires him
to be on lockdown

05:31.350 --> 05:33.885
as long as the threat to the
President remains red.

05:33.919 --> 05:35.486
He's in his bunker.

05:35.521 --> 05:36.654
Where's Carrie?

05:36.689 --> 05:37.689
Still in the hospital.

05:37.723 --> 05:39.858
She's supposed
to be released in a few hours.

05:39.892 --> 05:41.993
Good.
Tell her we need her here.

05:42.027 --> 05:43.528
Yes, sir.

05:59.409 --> 06:01.410
Green. No, green.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.878
I was specific about that,

06:02.912 --> 06:04.913
and I don't see what the problem is.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.251
A green pen is what I want.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.386
And blue is what is available.

06:11.420 --> 06:13.989
Okay, green is important.
Green is necessary.

06:14.023 --> 06:16.024
It doesn't make sense
if it isn't green,

06:16.058 --> 06:18.026
and it's really
not an unreasonable request.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.194
Carrie?

06:19.228 --> 06:22.264
Saul, thank God!
My green pen is dry.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.500
I asked four, five,
six times for a new one,

06:24.535 --> 06:26.002
but there's no understanding.

06:26.036 --> 06:27.737
They offered me blue,
they offered me black.

06:27.772 --> 06:30.040
I mean, is green so hard?
Is green elusive?

06:30.074 --> 06:32.343
I mean, my kingdom
for a fucking green pen!

06:32.377 --> 06:33.444
She's yours?

06:33.478 --> 06:34.946
Yes.

06:34.980 --> 06:36.614
She should go to her room.

06:36.649 --> 06:38.750
The doctor will be in.

06:38.784 --> 06:43.121
Okay, I am laser-
focused on the green,

06:43.155 --> 06:45.757
but there's more.
There's many, many, many, many more.

06:45.791 --> 06:49.528
The thing is, Saul, that
Abu Nazir has methods

06:49.562 --> 06:51.196
and patterns and priorities.

06:51.230 --> 06:53.531
A single sniper?
No, no.

06:53.566 --> 06:56.701
Abu Nazir doesn't do that.
He never has, he never will.

06:56.735 --> 06:58.403
He goes big!
He explodes!

06:58.437 --> 07:00.138
He maims en masse, we know that.

07:00.172 --> 07:01.578
Slow down, slow down.

07:01.698 --> 07:04.188
Facts... facts are facts,

07:04.308 --> 07:06.911
and we have about a week, maybe less,

07:06.945 --> 07:08.279
to figure out the real target,

07:08.313 --> 07:09.780
not this single shot to the president,

07:09.814 --> 07:11.381
spy-novel-101 bullshit.

07:11.416 --> 07:13.817
Well, actually, that's
the working theory.

07:13.851 --> 07:17.220
Well, it's wrong.
It's, it's incomplete.

07:17.254 --> 07:18.755
Walker's not even critical!

07:18.789 --> 07:21.258
He's just a part, a piece, a pixel.

07:21.292 --> 07:22.393
A pawn of no importance.

07:22.427 --> 07:24.094
There is a bigger, pernicious

07:24.128 --> 07:26.130
Abu Nazir-worthy plot
out there,

07:26.164 --> 07:27.632
and we have little time.

07:27.666 --> 07:29.000
We have to code it,

07:29.034 --> 07:31.636
collide it, collapse it, contain it.

07:31.670 --> 07:36.074
Lie down, Carrie.
The doctor's coming.

07:36.108 --> 07:40.345
Okay, the important thing now
is the green pen.

07:48.486 --> 07:50.154
Thank you.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.700
Why Gettysburg?

08:03.734 --> 08:04.767
You heard why.

08:04.802 --> 08:06.470
He wants to spend time
with his family.

08:06.504 --> 08:07.837
Yeah, but it has
to be in Pennsylvania?

08:07.872 --> 08:08.871
I mean, it can't be here?

08:08.906 --> 08:10.674
Can you just help, please?

08:10.708 --> 08:12.609
Mom, I have plans tonight with Xander.

08:12.643 --> 08:13.844
He already bought tickets.

08:16.381 --> 08:18.716
Actually, that's probably him.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.118
He said he might come over.

08:21.153 --> 08:23.154
Dad, I got it.
It's okay.

08:25.757 --> 08:28.526
Hey, Sergeant B!
Hello.

08:28.561 --> 08:30.529
Is it true you're
running for Congress?

08:30.563 --> 08:31.730
Yeah.
Are you?

08:31.764 --> 08:33.398
You 18?
No felonies?

08:33.433 --> 08:35.868
No, none yet.
All right.

08:35.902 --> 08:38.337
How are you?
Good.

08:38.371 --> 08:39.705
Hey, Mrs. B!

08:41.107 --> 08:42.707
Well, you obviously didn't tell Xander

08:42.741 --> 08:43.975
we're leaving for a couple days.

08:44.010 --> 08:45.376
It's a whole couple of days now?

08:45.411 --> 08:46.644
It's just overnight.

08:46.678 --> 08:48.079
Xander, uh, why don't you tell them

08:48.113 --> 08:49.580
about those tickets
that you already bought?

08:49.614 --> 08:51.648
What-what tickets?

08:51.683 --> 08:53.417
Dana, you're going.

08:53.451 --> 08:56.152
You know, I could stay here by myself.
No, you can't.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.421
You know, I could stay with her.
You're kidding, right?

08:58.456 --> 08:59.923
Dana, we've already discussed this.

08:59.958 --> 09:01.592
Come Monday, the campaign's
gonna take over,

09:01.626 --> 09:03.894
you're not gonna see your father

09:03.928 --> 09:05.529
for days at a time.
He just wants

09:05.563 --> 09:06.897
to spend one last weekend
with the four of us.

09:06.931 --> 09:08.432
I don't think it's too much to ask.

09:08.467 --> 09:11.402
Okay, I give up. I'll go.

09:11.436 --> 09:13.638
Mmm!

09:15.741 --> 09:17.709
Yeah, I'll go.

09:22.414 --> 09:23.914
Hi. Dr. Jeremy.

09:23.948 --> 09:24.914
Where's Dr. Steiner?

09:24.949 --> 09:25.949
Not here today.

09:25.983 --> 09:29.052
You're the doctor?

09:29.086 --> 09:30.920
I've been waiting
a half an hour.

09:30.954 --> 09:32.254
I'm sorry.

09:32.289 --> 09:34.523
I mean, I got a real situation here.

09:34.557 --> 09:36.558
I'm aware.
I spoke with Carrie earlier.

09:36.593 --> 09:38.693
Well, then you can explain to me
what's going on.

09:38.728 --> 09:40.796
As far as her injuries go,
Carrie is fine.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.764
I already heard that.

09:41.798 --> 09:45.935
I-I-I mean, um...

09:45.969 --> 09:47.604
how she's acting.

09:47.638 --> 09:49.439
I'm sorry. I have to speak
with Carrie privately.

09:49.473 --> 09:51.107
I'd like to come.
She'll allow it.

09:53.478 --> 09:55.579
Saul, there you are.

09:55.613 --> 09:56.980
Hey, how you feeling, Carrie?

09:57.015 --> 09:58.549
Is it time yet?
Are we going?

09:58.583 --> 09:59.783
Going?

09:59.818 --> 10:01.251
To work. We gotta hop-to.

10:01.286 --> 10:03.053
We gotta haul ass to Langley.

10:03.087 --> 10:05.088
They have to understand, Saul.

10:05.122 --> 10:08.657
Nazir's movements in green after
a fallow yellow always creeping

10:08.692 --> 10:12.227
towards purple are
methodical, meaningful

10:12.262 --> 10:14.430
momentous and monstrous.

10:14.464 --> 10:16.298
Okay, I'm gonna get you
a bit more Ativan

10:16.333 --> 10:17.399
to settle you down.

10:17.433 --> 10:18.933
I don't need to settle down!

10:18.968 --> 10:21.169
Tell him!

10:21.203 --> 10:24.105
Saul, tell him.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.507
Carrie...

10:26.542 --> 10:28.309
you're not yourself.

10:28.343 --> 10:30.078
Of course I am!

10:30.112 --> 10:33.181
No. I can't follow you.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.283
You're talking very fast.

10:35.317 --> 10:38.786
Your thoughts are running together.

10:38.821 --> 10:42.524
All these ideas...

10:42.558 --> 10:45.827
I-I... I can't understand.

10:52.134 --> 10:54.869
Is there a doctor we should call?

11:04.648 --> 11:06.883
My sister.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.029
Honey, is this really necessary?

11:18.064 --> 11:20.665
Complain to Ma, she's the one
that got it for me.

11:20.699 --> 11:22.467
Really?
Careful, careful! I'm driving.

11:22.501 --> 11:25.736
Jack me to Gettysburg,
and this is what you get.

11:25.770 --> 11:28.371
Okay, here it is.

11:28.406 --> 11:31.341
"Four score and seven years ago
our fathers brought forth on

11:31.375 --> 11:34.410
"this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty

11:34.444 --> 11:39.548
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal."

11:39.583 --> 11:41.250
What's four score?

11:41.285 --> 11:42.318
Four times 20.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.554
Lincoln means "87 years ago."

11:44.588 --> 11:49.225
He's talking about the American
Revolution of 1776.

11:49.259 --> 11:51.594
Why didn't he just say that?

11:51.628 --> 11:54.097
You'll see when we get there.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.999
How far are we now?

11:56.033 --> 11:57.834
Three score miles.

12:02.407 --> 12:03.340
Hey, come on.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.575
Holy shit!

12:04.609 --> 12:06.043
Dana! Really?

12:06.077 --> 12:07.678
I'm sorry.
I just hadn't realized

12:07.712 --> 12:10.381
Dad's scars were so faded.

12:10.415 --> 12:12.883
I mean, you can barely see 'em now.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.632
She'll be here, right?

12:28.666 --> 12:30.467
I mean, she said she was on her way?

12:30.502 --> 12:31.735
Maggie will come.
Maggie's reliable.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.237
You can count on Maggie every time.

12:34.573 --> 12:37.308
Is she an especially slow driver?

12:37.342 --> 12:39.443
Okay...
Huh?

12:39.478 --> 12:43.882
This is red <i>and</i> blue,
it's not red <i>or</i> blue. Okay.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.717
Maybe she got pulled over.

12:45.751 --> 12:47.318
Shit...

12:47.353 --> 12:49.821
Sleeping dogs here,
sleeping dogs there.

12:49.855 --> 12:53.458
This whole box is dogs, really.

12:56.829 --> 12:59.130
She can fix this, right?

12:59.164 --> 13:00.898
She said she was bringing medication.

13:00.933 --> 13:03.001
The question is what wakes them?

13:03.035 --> 13:06.338
Is it a whisper, a crash,
a deep internal pain?

13:06.372 --> 13:08.840
How about a glass of water?

13:16.216 --> 13:17.416
Hi.
Hi.

13:17.450 --> 13:19.486
She's manic?
I don't know, you tell me.

13:23.391 --> 13:25.760
Hi, Carrie.

13:25.794 --> 13:27.194
Hi, Maggie.

13:27.229 --> 13:29.130
You look so professional.

13:31.534 --> 13:33.502
So this isn't new?

13:33.536 --> 13:37.507
No. She's bi-polar.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.842
She's stable on her meds.

13:39.877 --> 13:42.145
The explosion must have
sent her into a flight.

13:42.179 --> 13:44.147
Why didn't she ever tell me?

13:44.181 --> 13:46.449
She said no one at work could know.

13:46.483 --> 13:47.984
Right.

13:48.018 --> 13:50.520
So what do we do?

13:50.555 --> 13:51.988
We'll up her Lithium.

13:52.023 --> 13:55.392
We're giving her Clonazepam
to start leveling her out.

13:58.563 --> 13:59.964
Carrie?

14:14.946 --> 14:17.848
Is it essential, entirely?

14:17.883 --> 14:19.850
Yeah, it is.

14:22.854 --> 14:24.221
Here you go.

14:38.470 --> 14:42.372
So that's it?
She'll be fine by what, morning?

14:42.406 --> 14:44.741
No. It takes time. Days.

14:44.775 --> 14:47.276
Maybe a week.
Oh, that long?

14:47.311 --> 14:49.278
And someone needs to watch her

14:49.312 --> 14:50.846
while she's evening out.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.015
Full-time?

14:53.049 --> 14:56.684
Or we put her in the psych ward.

14:56.718 --> 15:00.287
Well, that would kill
her security clearance forever.

15:00.322 --> 15:02.389
That's why I treat her.

15:03.992 --> 15:07.027
Well...

15:07.062 --> 15:08.762
I got to get back to work.

15:10.131 --> 15:12.032
I can stay till 7:00.

15:12.067 --> 15:14.601
Can you take the night shift?

15:14.635 --> 15:17.404
Well, what do I have to do?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.239
Just be with her.

15:19.273 --> 15:20.940
Keep her out of trouble.

15:20.975 --> 15:23.777
Okay. 7:00.

15:56.678 --> 16:00.113
Welcome to my goddamn humble abode.

16:00.148 --> 16:01.749
Want to tell me where we stand?

16:01.783 --> 16:04.084
We've been coordinating security
with your secret service detail.

16:04.119 --> 16:06.721
Well, I've been in here
for eight hours.

16:08.490 --> 16:10.992
At present, the threat...

16:11.026 --> 16:12.693
The threat is one fucking guy.

16:12.727 --> 16:15.629
Marine sniper, sir, highly trained.

16:15.663 --> 16:19.799
Do you see where I am?
Do you?

16:19.834 --> 16:23.003
I'm underground cowering out of sight,

16:23.037 --> 16:25.271
at a time when I need
to be highly visible.

16:25.305 --> 16:27.940
I'm announcing my candidacy next week
for President of the United States.

16:27.975 --> 16:29.475
You may need to push that back, sir.

16:29.509 --> 16:31.043
I'm not going to push that back...
Sorry...

16:31.078 --> 16:33.445
I am not going to push that back.
That date is set.

16:33.479 --> 16:36.047
And I'm not going to do it from here.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.983
Vote for the fucking cave dweller

16:38.017 --> 16:40.152
just because you
can't locate Tom Walker.

16:40.186 --> 16:41.720
Yes, sir.

16:41.754 --> 16:43.522
So fix it.

16:48.395 --> 16:51.664
Sir, there's something you should know.
What's that?

16:51.699 --> 16:53.333
The C-4 used in the explosion--

16:53.367 --> 16:54.968
we sourced it to a Saudi shipment.

16:55.003 --> 16:56.570
Oh...

16:56.604 --> 16:59.039
It was delivered last year
to Prince Sultan Air Base.

16:59.074 --> 17:01.008
Part of a large arms
deal that came in...

17:01.042 --> 17:03.577
Why do you do this?
What's that, sir?

17:03.611 --> 17:05.645
Tell me things I don't want to hear.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.513
We've got two Muslims
dead in a mosque,

17:07.548 --> 17:09.415
an explosion in
the streets of D.C.

17:09.450 --> 17:11.184
and Walker who the fuck knows where?

17:11.218 --> 17:13.752
You want your portrait up on the
walls at Langley someday?

17:13.787 --> 17:17.122
Focus on that. Find Walker.

17:18.590 --> 17:20.858
Yes, sir.

17:20.893 --> 17:23.994
And fire someone.

17:24.030 --> 17:25.863
I don't care who.

17:42.881 --> 17:45.249
That's it?

17:45.283 --> 17:47.217
Yep. That's it.

17:47.252 --> 17:49.453
Can we go now?

17:49.487 --> 17:51.721
Only if you can tell
me what happened here.

17:51.756 --> 17:53.189
Battle of Gettysburg.

17:53.224 --> 17:55.091
Can you be more specific?

17:55.126 --> 17:57.360
Four score and...

17:57.394 --> 17:59.662
I didn't know I'd be tested.

18:02.466 --> 18:05.636
Okay, we're in Pennsylvania, right?

18:05.670 --> 18:08.573
Was that the South or the North?

18:08.607 --> 18:11.543
God. North.

18:11.577 --> 18:13.778
That's right.

18:13.813 --> 18:16.448
General Lee had brought
the war to the North.

18:16.482 --> 18:19.618
The South was winning.

18:19.652 --> 18:24.222
The Northern forces were outnumbered,
and they were on the run.

18:24.257 --> 18:26.257
Then they dug in there.

18:26.292 --> 18:29.127
All along that ridge.

18:29.162 --> 18:32.798
General Meade, the Northern general,

18:32.832 --> 18:35.301
he drew a line out there

18:35.335 --> 18:37.303
and he gave instructions to his troops

18:37.337 --> 18:39.338
to defend it at all costs.

18:39.372 --> 18:41.006
And that means with your life.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.309
What happened?

18:43.343 --> 18:45.778
They prayed.

18:45.812 --> 18:48.347
Both sides did.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.918
These were extremely religious people.

18:52.953 --> 18:55.521
I meant what happened
with the fighting?

18:56.790 --> 18:59.959
Well, imagine...

19:02.229 --> 19:07.700
You're bone tired,
you're cut off from water.

19:07.734 --> 19:11.170
The most crucial part of
the line that must be held

19:11.204 --> 19:12.604
it's right up there.

19:12.639 --> 19:14.273
You see up there, that little hill?

19:14.307 --> 19:16.509
It's Little Round Top.

19:16.543 --> 19:20.813
There are just 300 of you.

19:20.847 --> 19:24.883
You're commanded by
a school teacher from Maine.

19:24.918 --> 19:28.820
When suddenly, 2,000 enemy soldiers

19:28.855 --> 19:31.623
come charging out of those trees,

19:31.658 --> 19:34.493
screaming at the top of their lungs,

19:34.527 --> 19:36.661
determined to cut you down.

19:36.696 --> 19:38.463
Did they?

19:38.497 --> 19:40.465
They charged twice.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.634
And then a third time.

19:44.403 --> 19:47.206
And that's when this teacher
from Maine--

19:47.240 --> 19:52.011
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain
was his name...

19:53.914 --> 19:56.249
...asked his men
to do a very strange thing.

19:56.283 --> 19:57.884
What?

19:57.919 --> 20:00.487
He told them to stop shooting.

20:00.521 --> 20:03.857
No guns, just bayonets.

20:03.891 --> 20:05.825
And instead of shooting

20:05.860 --> 20:10.497
they charged down the side of
that hill toward the enemy.

20:10.531 --> 20:15.402
And it was so unexpected,
it was so crazy,

20:15.437 --> 20:17.939
that the line was held that day.

20:19.441 --> 20:21.776
All because of a school teacher

20:21.810 --> 20:26.882
from Maine, who was willing
to do what was necessary

20:26.916 --> 20:29.818
for a cause that he believed in.

20:38.429 --> 20:41.063
Saul.

20:41.098 --> 20:42.932
Where've you been?

20:42.966 --> 20:44.734
You told me to get Carrie, remember?

20:44.768 --> 20:45.968
Where is she?

20:46.002 --> 20:47.403
Keeping her another day.

20:47.437 --> 20:49.938
Perfect.

20:49.973 --> 20:51.406
Hey, David.

20:53.276 --> 20:57.078
She said something interesting.
Of course she did.

20:57.112 --> 21:00.648
Sniper attack-- that doesn't
make sense for Abu Nazir.

21:00.683 --> 21:02.818
It's not his methodology.

21:02.852 --> 21:05.588
Well, maybe it is when he has a
military sniper working for him.

21:05.622 --> 21:07.156
She thinks something bigger.

21:07.190 --> 21:10.593
Marine One all over the wire.
New references to Marine Two.

21:10.628 --> 21:13.397
The two leaders of the free world
aren't fancy enough targets for you?

21:13.431 --> 21:15.332
She says it's a sideshow.

21:15.366 --> 21:18.736
If she wants to get her ass in to work
I'll be happy to bat that around with her.

21:18.771 --> 21:20.838
Right.
And it better be soon,

21:20.873 --> 21:22.507
because the Vice President's
about to fire us all.

21:22.541 --> 21:25.643
She just got blown up, David.
Might not be tomorrow.

21:25.677 --> 21:27.044
Why, what's the problem?

21:28.280 --> 21:30.113
Doctor's orders.

21:44.361 --> 21:46.696
Dad.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.269
Yeah?

21:51.303 --> 21:53.137
You okay?

21:55.074 --> 21:56.942
Yeah.

21:56.976 --> 21:59.378
Yeah, I was just thinking.

21:59.413 --> 22:00.880
Where'd your mom go?

22:00.915 --> 22:03.349
Gift shop with Chris.

22:05.385 --> 22:08.688
I had no idea that you knew so much.

22:08.722 --> 22:11.725
About Gettysburg?
About anything.

22:14.396 --> 22:16.564
I mean, I know
you're a Marine and all,

22:16.598 --> 22:18.900
and I shouldn't be surprised.

22:21.837 --> 22:24.706
Anyway, I get why
you wanted to come here.

22:26.942 --> 22:30.045
Can you promise me something?

22:31.280 --> 22:33.548
Yeah. What?

22:38.287 --> 22:41.523
I have this feeling that things are
going to get pretty wild soon.

22:41.557 --> 22:45.060
Geez, Dad, it's just a campaign.

22:45.094 --> 22:47.896
Your mom's going to need you.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.232
When I'm not around.

22:54.571 --> 22:56.972
Promise me you'll watch out for her.

22:59.810 --> 23:01.444
Promise me.

23:01.478 --> 23:04.447
Hey, look what we got.

23:07.284 --> 23:08.985
Yeah, I promise.

23:11.488 --> 23:12.956
You want one?

23:12.990 --> 23:14.691
Oh, that's fantastic.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.959
One for you.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.127
That's great.

23:17.161 --> 23:18.529
I don't get a general's hat?

23:18.563 --> 23:19.897
I'm the boss around here, that's why.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.031
You are.

23:21.065 --> 23:23.467
Let's see you salute.

23:23.501 --> 23:27.972
Hi-oh.
Corporal First Class.

23:28.006 --> 23:31.375
How do you have no food in your house?

23:31.409 --> 23:33.244
I eat out.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.913
You eat Chinese take-out
and yogurt.

23:35.947 --> 23:38.716
You ever hear of the four food groups?

23:38.750 --> 23:42.319
Yes. But I won't recite them
because I'm resting my mind.

23:42.353 --> 23:44.922
I know you hate this.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.790
I have a lot of work to do.

23:46.824 --> 23:47.991
You always say that.

23:48.025 --> 23:50.293
No, no, something big is
happening. Something dangerous.

23:50.328 --> 23:53.964
There's no time for rest.
I know you feel that.

23:53.998 --> 23:56.066
But you'll need to trust
my judgment now.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.302
You need rest, healthy meals,
patience.

24:08.478 --> 24:10.645
Carrie! Carrie,
what are you doing?

24:10.680 --> 24:11.980
Carrie!

24:13.215 --> 24:14.549
Carrie!

24:22.356 --> 24:24.157
What are you doing?

24:24.192 --> 24:26.159
What the hell are you doing?!

24:26.194 --> 24:27.660
Look at this.

24:27.695 --> 24:29.028
You have to stay with me.

24:29.063 --> 24:30.330
Isn't this amazing?

24:30.364 --> 24:32.298
We're going home.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.667
Somewhere down there, there's
a sliver of green

24:34.701 --> 24:36.168
just-just taking its time.

24:36.202 --> 24:39.972
This is-- this is how
everything works.

24:40.006 --> 24:42.542
Carrie...

24:42.576 --> 24:47.180
You wait, you lay low, and then...

24:47.215 --> 24:50.050
Then you come to life.

24:52.220 --> 24:54.155
Come on.

24:54.189 --> 24:55.856
Come on.

25:11.206 --> 25:13.840
So what do you want to eat, guys?

25:13.874 --> 25:15.708
I don't know.

25:15.742 --> 25:18.143
What do we got?
Should we try this place?

25:18.178 --> 25:20.847
Oh, babe, you know what?
I forgot my toothbrush.

25:20.881 --> 25:22.548
I'm going to go pick one up.
Okay.

25:22.582 --> 25:24.250
All right? Will you get me
something to eat?

25:24.284 --> 25:25.685
Will you get me a burger?

25:25.719 --> 25:29.322
Chocolate shake?
Okay.

26:03.421 --> 26:06.589
<i>As-salaamu alaykum.</i>

26:06.624 --> 26:11.427
<i>Wa alaykum assalaam wa ramat</i>
<i>allahi wa barakatuhu.</i>

26:12.729 --> 26:15.131
I don't have much time.

26:33.751 --> 26:36.319
Put your arm through here.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.732
The explosive?

26:47.766 --> 26:49.300
Not armed yet.

26:49.334 --> 26:50.968
Listen now.

26:53.506 --> 26:57.609
These must be tight.

26:57.644 --> 27:00.812
Or the vest will show.

27:00.846 --> 27:03.615
The switch is here.

27:05.817 --> 27:07.318
Under this cover.

27:07.352 --> 27:12.589
Wait until the last second
before you open it.

27:12.623 --> 27:15.358
Some people get nervous.

27:15.392 --> 27:20.363
You don't want your hand
on the switch until the end.

27:40.153 --> 27:44.456
I read that part of the
blast goes upward.

27:44.491 --> 27:46.959
Toward here.

27:46.993 --> 27:48.994
Point of weakness.

27:49.029 --> 27:54.165
So that the head is cleanly severed,

27:54.200 --> 27:57.502
and normally found intact.

27:57.536 --> 28:00.938
Everything else...

28:02.174 --> 28:03.941
...isn't.

28:20.695 --> 28:23.463
<i>La ilaha illa Allah.</i>

29:04.904 --> 29:06.405
Where were you?

29:06.440 --> 29:09.108
Huh?

29:09.143 --> 29:11.077
What was that? That package?

29:11.112 --> 29:14.481
Oh, that was just something for Mom.

29:14.516 --> 29:17.084
What?

29:17.119 --> 29:18.953
That was a present.

29:18.988 --> 29:20.655
You get me something to eat?

29:20.689 --> 29:22.257
Yeah. It's getting cold.

29:22.291 --> 29:23.658
Okay.

29:23.693 --> 29:25.327
Is something wrong?

29:25.361 --> 29:26.561
No. Why?

29:26.596 --> 29:29.998
You just sound weird.

29:30.032 --> 29:32.601
Come on.

29:32.635 --> 29:35.638
What'd you get, a burger?
Yeah.

29:35.672 --> 29:37.673
Sweet potato fries.

29:37.708 --> 29:39.008
I already put ketchup on it.

29:39.042 --> 29:40.610
I can't put it in the milkshake now.

29:40.644 --> 29:43.079
Get another one.
Chris...

29:43.114 --> 29:44.581
- Eat it.
- You eat it.

29:44.615 --> 29:46.649
I already, I...
Try it.

29:46.684 --> 29:49.352
Hey, Dad, isn't this where we were?

29:49.387 --> 29:51.254
Chris, did you steal all my fries?

29:51.288 --> 29:52.689
Sorry. We were hungry.
Yeah.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.191
Totally okay.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.493
In there, up here.
That's us there, Little Round Top.

29:56.527 --> 29:57.694
Excuse me?

29:57.729 --> 30:02.632
You're that soldier back from Iraq.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.301
One of them.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.836
You're the hero.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.805
Running for office.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.975
I'm no hero, sir.

30:12.009 --> 30:14.478
Well, whatever you call it,

30:14.512 --> 30:16.513
you're one tough motherfucker.

30:17.682 --> 30:21.484
Man, what
you went through--

30:21.519 --> 30:23.653
kind of puts things in perspective.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.724
I'd vote for you.

30:36.734 --> 30:38.468
Thank you, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

30:38.502 --> 30:40.636
I'm waiting to hear
what you have to say.

30:40.671 --> 30:42.138
I'm sure it's going to be good.

30:42.172 --> 30:44.506
Hey, this is my son Jimmy.
Hey, Jimmy.

30:44.541 --> 30:47.409
We run a construction
business locally.

30:47.444 --> 30:51.013
To be honest...

31:03.926 --> 31:06.161
Hi.
Hi.

31:06.196 --> 31:08.030
She's upstairs.
Took her meds already.

31:08.065 --> 31:09.665
Good.

31:14.238 --> 31:15.838
She was working.

31:20.978 --> 31:24.045
There was an incident today.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.014
What happened?

31:27.316 --> 31:29.717
She almost got hit by a car.

31:29.751 --> 31:32.086
She's okay.
She's fine.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.922
But I had to give her
another sedative.

31:35.957 --> 31:37.457
She really needs to rest.

31:37.491 --> 31:39.859
Okay.

31:39.893 --> 31:42.729
I'll go see her.

31:42.763 --> 31:46.566
She's probably asleep already.
You don't have to.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.134
I want to.

31:48.168 --> 31:50.036
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:02.317 --> 32:03.951
Saul.

32:05.586 --> 32:07.954
Sorry I didn't say
good-bye this morning.

32:07.988 --> 32:10.423
Did you see the papers?
Downstairs-- the work?

32:10.457 --> 32:11.590
I did.

32:14.294 --> 32:16.628
There's so much more to do.

32:16.663 --> 32:19.765
I'm just so sleepy.

32:19.799 --> 32:23.736
That's okay. Rest.

32:23.771 --> 32:26.139
Maggie upped my meds.
I shouldn't have let her.

32:26.173 --> 32:29.610
They're making me so drowsy.

32:33.949 --> 32:36.785
Carrie?

32:36.819 --> 32:39.855
I'm so sorry.

32:39.889 --> 32:42.224
About all this.

32:45.195 --> 32:49.264
I feel responsible in a way.

32:49.298 --> 32:53.467
'Cause when you came back
from Baghdad, I knew.

32:53.502 --> 32:56.270
I saw something had happened.

32:56.305 --> 32:58.673
You were damaged.

33:02.144 --> 33:04.512
I left it alone.

33:05.848 --> 33:08.883
Other times when you were so...

33:08.917 --> 33:12.352
out there, I guess I half knew.

33:12.387 --> 33:15.622
Maybe hoping it was something else.

33:15.656 --> 33:20.359
Anyway, I should have asked.

33:20.393 --> 33:23.896
I should have asked
if you were really okay.

33:29.369 --> 33:31.270
There's no time, Saul.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.041
It's high purple.

36:13.869 --> 36:16.471
I thought I heard you out here.

36:16.506 --> 36:18.407
I need more ice.

36:18.441 --> 36:20.009
Again?

36:20.043 --> 36:21.977
It's free.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.348
You glad we came?
Yeah.

36:26.382 --> 36:28.217
The guy at the diner was funny.

36:28.251 --> 36:29.518
Yeah.

36:29.552 --> 36:30.852
Did you like Gettysburg?

36:30.887 --> 36:33.221
Yeah, it was cool.

36:33.256 --> 36:35.590
I wanted you to understand.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.560
That the Civil War, all wars,

36:38.595 --> 36:40.762
they turn everything upside down.

36:40.797 --> 36:43.533
Everything and everyone.

36:43.567 --> 36:46.836
I hope that you'll remember

36:46.870 --> 36:50.006
Joshua Chamberlain when you get older.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.044
And be brave, and daring,

36:54.079 --> 36:56.413
and ready to fight
for what you believe in.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.714
Dad...

36:57.749 --> 36:59.283
What?

36:59.317 --> 37:02.286
Do you mind if we talk
about this some other time?

37:02.320 --> 37:04.820
It's kind of melting.

37:24.608 --> 37:27.644
Tell your sister to go to bed soon.

37:27.678 --> 37:30.214
Okay.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.082
Good night.

37:33.184 --> 37:35.419
Good night.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.138
I told Chris to get to bed.

37:58.144 --> 38:00.746
I'll give him a direct
order next time.

38:06.153 --> 38:09.122
What?

38:09.156 --> 38:10.857
Why the big smile?

38:10.891 --> 38:12.525
Just happy to see you, that's all.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.661
Yeah?

38:14.696 --> 38:17.998
I really think this trip
was a great idea.

38:18.032 --> 38:20.768
It's like something's changed.

38:20.802 --> 38:22.369
Like we've turned this corner,

38:22.404 --> 38:26.707
and everything doesn't have
to be so difficult anymore.

38:26.741 --> 38:30.777
When I was watching you
at dinner with those people,

38:30.811 --> 38:33.279
how much they need you.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.681
I don't think they were
even from our district.

38:35.715 --> 38:38.016
I know.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.619
But I could see it.

38:40.653 --> 38:43.722
How you're this promise.

38:43.756 --> 38:46.491
That things could be better.

38:47.994 --> 38:52.498
I wish that I had never said
no to your running for office.

38:52.532 --> 38:55.301
'Cause I see now what
a good thing it is.

38:55.335 --> 38:58.071
Not just for other people...

38:58.105 --> 39:00.040
for us, too.

39:06.014 --> 39:09.650
Brody, I'm...

39:09.684 --> 39:13.053
What?

39:14.556 --> 39:16.390
...happy.

39:39.883 --> 39:42.752
It's like you're finally home.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.804
The kids are next door.

39:58.839 --> 40:00.273
Shh, shh, shh...

41:09.343 --> 41:11.210
You understand.

41:11.245 --> 41:14.281
It's a timeline.

41:14.315 --> 41:18.219
Yes! It's Abu Nazir's
activities.

41:18.253 --> 41:19.387
Were you up all night?

41:19.421 --> 41:21.388
More or less.

41:26.428 --> 41:27.895
The fallow yellow.

41:27.930 --> 41:29.363
He went quiet for months.

41:29.398 --> 41:30.998
No videos, no meetings.
But then?

41:31.033 --> 41:33.334
He came to life again with purpose.
More than ever.

41:33.368 --> 41:35.502
But why the hibernation?
What happened?

41:35.537 --> 41:38.238
Injury? Bad health?

41:38.273 --> 41:40.740
Or loss.

41:40.775 --> 41:41.975
Tragedy.

41:42.009 --> 41:44.411
He was mourning during the yellow.

41:44.445 --> 41:48.882
And then green was revenge.

41:48.916 --> 41:50.183
It was a plan.

41:50.218 --> 41:53.319
And now... the purple.

41:53.354 --> 41:56.088
He's ready to see it through.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.556
It's here.

41:57.590 --> 41:59.691
We have to figure out what
happened right here.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.260
I'll get the A team on it
this morning.

42:01.294 --> 42:03.328
Galvez--
he can find anything.

42:03.363 --> 42:04.830
That's a good idea.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.667
What about me?

42:09.702 --> 42:11.469
You relax.

42:24.918 --> 42:27.886
I did hear you last night.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.488
You did?

42:34.760 --> 42:36.828
I've had this since college.

42:38.798 --> 42:43.535
I wrote a 45-page manifesto
declaring I'd reinvented music.

42:45.171 --> 42:48.306
The professor I handed it to
escorted me to Student Health.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.074
Ah.

42:50.109 --> 42:53.511
I wasn't even in his class.

42:58.451 --> 43:00.952
You didn't do anything, Saul.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.959
I just came this way.

43:14.002 --> 43:15.937
Dad wanted to be here.

43:15.971 --> 43:19.207
You bet I did.
Hey, how's my girl, huh?

43:24.546 --> 43:26.514
What is that?

43:26.548 --> 43:29.350
It's her work.

43:31.153 --> 43:32.853
That's goddamned glorious.

43:32.887 --> 43:34.588
It should be in the National Galley.

43:34.622 --> 43:36.456
Dad, this is Saul.

43:36.491 --> 43:38.792
Hey. Frank Mathison.

43:38.826 --> 43:40.026
I hear you look out for her.

43:40.061 --> 43:41.227
Happily.

43:42.663 --> 43:45.698
Sorry. Gotta run.
Oh, well...

43:45.733 --> 43:47.934
You'll tell Galvez?

43:47.968 --> 43:49.969
And you'll sit tight.

43:54.741 --> 43:56.308
So?

43:56.342 --> 43:58.343
I slept.

43:58.377 --> 43:59.811
Hey.

43:59.845 --> 44:02.113
Let's get you a square meal.

44:02.148 --> 44:03.715
Yeah, yeah, come on.
I'll make you one

44:03.749 --> 44:05.517
of my world-famous
sandwiches, huh?

44:35.414 --> 44:36.915
Morning!

44:36.949 --> 44:38.717
Ha!

44:38.751 --> 44:40.985
Serves you right.

44:41.019 --> 44:43.320
You're supposed to be packing,

44:43.355 --> 44:44.521
not unpacking.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.056
What is it?

44:46.091 --> 44:48.726
I told you, something for Mom.

44:48.760 --> 44:50.661
Really? You got her
something at the drugstore?

44:50.695 --> 44:53.397
Yeah, I did.

44:53.431 --> 44:54.899
Really.

44:56.434 --> 44:58.569
You two ready?

44:58.603 --> 45:01.004
Yeah. Shh.
Yeah, we're ready!

45:05.743 --> 45:07.843
Thanks. All right.

45:13.383 --> 45:15.050
You're supposed to help me with this.

45:15.084 --> 45:16.284
Why?

45:16.319 --> 45:18.619
To exercise your mind.
But not tax it.

45:18.654 --> 45:20.187
I have to go to work.

45:20.222 --> 45:22.089
No way.

45:22.123 --> 45:23.757
I'm okay!

45:23.791 --> 45:26.960
I may have a major situation
that I know how to fix.

45:26.994 --> 45:28.461
I know how to stop it.

45:28.495 --> 45:29.729
Feels good out there, doesn't it?

45:29.763 --> 45:31.130
Like you're the Queen of the world.

45:31.165 --> 45:32.364
Yes! Exactly!

45:32.399 --> 45:34.733
But you're not, Carrie.

45:36.769 --> 45:39.204
Okay, I just have to make a call.

45:39.238 --> 45:40.639
To who?

45:40.673 --> 45:44.376
There's this guy I know.
He's a POW.

45:44.410 --> 45:46.812
He knows how to fill in
this blank, this-this gap

45:46.847 --> 45:49.081
because he was there
at that exact time.

45:49.116 --> 45:50.650
So tell Saul to call him.

45:50.684 --> 45:52.952
No, it-it, it has to be me.

45:52.986 --> 45:54.887
He only told me.

45:54.922 --> 45:56.422
Your sister said no calls.

45:56.456 --> 45:57.757
No, I have to, Dad.

45:57.791 --> 45:58.758
Hey, look!

45:58.793 --> 46:00.293
You're only one day out.

46:00.327 --> 46:01.994
Hey, when I'm there,
I'm just like you.

46:02.029 --> 46:04.397
You know, lots of gut feelings,
things that I have to do.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.766
But there's good gut,
and then there's bad.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.668
Yeah?
Well, sometimes I think I need

46:08.702 --> 46:11.337
to empty my refrigerator
and set it on fire, you know?

46:11.371 --> 46:13.071
That's what my gut says.

46:13.106 --> 46:15.140
It's bad gut.

46:15.174 --> 46:16.675
And if I wait a while,

46:16.709 --> 46:19.844
I realize it.

46:23.550 --> 46:25.851
No, this is right.
This is right, I know it.

46:25.886 --> 46:27.253
No, Carrie, come on!

46:27.287 --> 46:28.822
Hey, come on! Come on!

46:28.856 --> 46:31.591
I got the corners together.
You can help me with the sides.

46:31.626 --> 46:33.594
Carrie!

46:33.628 --> 46:35.763
Ah, shit!

46:53.315 --> 46:56.816
Oh, gee, I wonder who leaked our ETA.

46:56.850 --> 47:00.619
Maybe he spent the entire
weekend here waiting for me.

47:00.654 --> 47:02.221
Ever think about that?

47:12.165 --> 47:13.632
It's good to be home.

47:13.667 --> 47:14.900
What? Yeah.

47:14.935 --> 47:17.069
Yeah, it is.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.984
Oh, it's already started.

47:34.018 --> 47:36.419
Chris, help your mom with the bags.

47:39.456 --> 47:40.223
Hello.

47:40.257 --> 47:41.424
It's Carrie.

47:41.458 --> 47:43.059
I know.

47:43.093 --> 47:44.694
Okay.

47:44.728 --> 47:48.932
I'm calling you, not because of
me and not because of you.

47:48.966 --> 47:51.267
I'm not calling to try to...

47:51.302 --> 47:54.839
I-I... I'm just calling
about Abu Nazir.

47:54.873 --> 47:57.041
What?

47:57.075 --> 47:58.709
Let me be more clear.

47:58.744 --> 48:03.581
Okay. We have been alerted
that something is coming.

48:03.615 --> 48:06.084
Something is gonna happen imminently,

48:06.118 --> 48:07.918
and it all has to do

48:07.953 --> 48:12.289
with a certain period in Abu
Nazir's life, the fallow yellow

48:12.323 --> 48:13.790
if you want to be precise.

48:13.825 --> 48:14.858
I don't understand.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.194
Okay, you were with him then.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.928
You have insight.

48:18.963 --> 48:23.133
You can identify the impetus,
the incident, the injury.

48:24.502 --> 48:28.439
Something happened to him, a tragedy.

48:28.474 --> 48:29.975
Carrie, are you okay?

48:30.009 --> 48:33.645
You loved him! You told me
that you loved him,

48:33.679 --> 48:36.081
so you must know.

48:41.654 --> 48:45.090
Look, uh, would it help if we met?

48:45.124 --> 48:48.560
Yes! Yeah, okay. Good.

48:48.594 --> 48:50.161
Are you at Langley?

48:50.196 --> 48:51.830
No, no, I'm home.

48:51.864 --> 48:53.798
Stay there.

48:53.832 --> 48:55.733
Okay.

49:04.810 --> 49:06.310
What's that?

49:06.344 --> 49:08.279
It's called Little Round Top.

49:08.313 --> 49:12.116
It's this place where
this teacher from Maine

49:12.151 --> 49:14.618
named Joshua Chamberlain
saved the Union.

49:14.653 --> 49:16.521
I don't see what's so weird about it.

49:16.555 --> 49:18.289
Well, it's not the weird part.

49:18.323 --> 49:22.260
Okay, here it is.

49:22.294 --> 49:24.463
Now it's just your dad.

49:24.497 --> 49:25.831
I know.

49:25.865 --> 49:28.300
So what's, what's weird about it?

49:30.303 --> 49:32.672
He was just strange all weekend,

49:32.706 --> 49:35.041
or at least it seemed like it to me.

49:35.075 --> 49:39.913
I mean, he said everything
was fine, but look at this.

49:47.655 --> 49:50.691
He just... stands there.

49:58.900 --> 50:01.301
You're right.

50:01.335 --> 50:03.237
That is totally weird.

50:53.090 --> 50:54.424
Okay.

51:17.483 --> 51:19.318
Who's that?

51:19.352 --> 51:21.252
It's a friend.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.896
David.

51:30.930 --> 51:32.597
Sergeant Brody called me.

51:32.632 --> 51:34.566
What?

51:34.600 --> 51:36.635
He told me everything.

51:38.137 --> 51:39.972
I-I don't know what you mean.

51:40.006 --> 51:41.941
I think you do.

51:41.975 --> 51:44.477
Come on. Let's go inside.
What?

51:44.511 --> 51:45.711
Come on.

51:49.283 --> 51:50.416
Ma'am, sir.

51:50.451 --> 51:52.786
Excuse me.

51:52.820 --> 51:56.189
He admitted to being complicit
in some kind of fling with you.

51:56.223 --> 51:59.459
But illegal surveillance, Carrie?

51:59.494 --> 52:00.660
The continuing harassment?

52:00.695 --> 52:03.096
No! That-that is
a mischaracterization.

52:03.131 --> 52:05.999
Your office at Langley's
being cleared as we speak.

52:06.034 --> 52:07.601
These gentlemen are
here to do the same.

52:07.635 --> 52:09.670
What? No! No!

52:09.705 --> 52:11.272
Carrie, Carrie...

52:16.679 --> 52:20.816
Are those classified documents?

52:20.850 --> 52:23.818
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

52:23.853 --> 52:26.688
No, David, that chart is
very important!

52:26.722 --> 52:28.189
It is very meaningful!

52:30.258 --> 52:31.659
What is wrong with her?

52:31.693 --> 52:33.160
No, don't. Don't tell him.

52:33.195 --> 52:35.663
David...

52:35.697 --> 52:39.667
I am about to solve
this fucking thing!

52:46.548 --> 52:47.808
Strip it.

52:47.843 --> 52:50.545
- No, no, no, no, no! Please, please!
- Carrie, no, come on.

52:50.579 --> 52:52.881
We need to sit down right now.
Come with me. I'm serious!

52:52.915 --> 52:56.184
- We're gonna sit down right... - Please, just
let me hold onto it for a little while...

52:56.218 --> 52:57.919
How long has she
been like this?

52:57.953 --> 53:00.488
No! You don't... you don't know
what you're doing!

53:00.523 --> 53:02.891
Carrie?
You don't know what you're doing!

53:02.925 --> 53:04.326
We're just gonna...
No!

53:04.360 --> 53:07.163
David, this isn't...!
