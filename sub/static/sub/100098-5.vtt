00:03.480 --> 00:05.039
- Get in.
- What about him?

00:05.120 --> 00:06.634
He's dead.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.593
- Krista.
- Leave me alone.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.400
She our girl. She knows
something I gotta know.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.392
We are very pleased
that you are back to work.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.936
<i>Let us know if there's anything
you need, and we'll do the same.</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:18.236
<i>He's an Irish mobster
out of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

00:18.360 --> 00:19.510
If I can find a way

00:19.600 --> 00:22.035
<i>to rob the Deus Group,
Whiterose loses everything.</i>

00:22.120 --> 00:24.510
I got into Olivia's
Cyprus National Bank account.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.512
<i>I can see all the Deus
account numbers,</i>

00:26.600 --> 00:28.512
<i>but she's not authorized
to transfer anything.</i>

00:28.600 --> 00:31.434
<i>Which means we are gonna have to
break into Virtual Realty</i>

00:31.520 --> 00:32.954
<i>and get on their servers.</i>

00:33.040 --> 00:34.440
Schedule the meeting
for tomorrow.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.399
There's no way we'll be able to get
the Deus Group together so quickly.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.680
<i>I have lost everyone.</i>

00:38.760 --> 00:40.433
<i>The only one I have left
is my brother</i>

00:40.560 --> 00:42.552
who treats me
like absolute shit.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.359
<i>But I'm really worried about
him right now.</i>

00:44.480 --> 00:45.600
<i>I'm afraid he might be dead.</i>

00:48.400 --> 00:49.436
Tyrell.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.077
Burn the van
and all the evidence.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.240
It's cool, dude.
We don't have to talk.

39:57.680 --> 39:58.830
Argh!

48:46.640 --> 48:47.960
It's time we talk.
