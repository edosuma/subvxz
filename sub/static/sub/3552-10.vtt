00:01.202 --> 00:02.303

00:02.303 --> 00:06.207
RENEE FEARED BEN WAS CHEATING.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.339
AND WITH DETECTIVE VANCE
CLOSING IN...

00:08.339 --> 00:11.242
DO YOU THINK WE NEED A LAWYER?
 LAWYERS WON'T BE NECESSARY,
LADIES.

00:11.242 --> 00:13.013
SUSAN WANTED TO FLEE.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.447
IF I GET CAUGHT, I COULD
GO AWAY FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

00:16.447 --> 00:18.619
LYNETTE WENT TO TOM FOR HELP.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.521
YOU CAN'T GO TO PARIS,
NOT NOW.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.293
I'M AN ACCESSORY TO MURDER.

00:22.293 --> 00:25.196
CARLOS DISAPPEARED FROM REHAB.

00:25.196 --> 00:26.627
HE CHECKED HIMSELF OUT
TWO HOURS AGO.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.229
WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

00:28.229 --> 00:30.631
MY UNOFFICIAL INVESTIGATION'S
ABOUT TO GO OFFICIAL.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.232
BUT BEFORE
HE COULD GO PUBLIC...

00:32.232 --> 00:34.405
AAH!

00:34.405 --> 00:38.509
AND BREE DECIDED TO END IT ALL.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.175
(Mary Alice) BREE VAN DE KAMP

00:44.175 --> 00:46.117
HAD ALWAYS WANTED
TO LIVE HER LIFE

00:46.117 --> 00:49.620
WITH ELEGANCE AND GRACE.

00:49.620 --> 00:54.225
THAT IS ALSO
HOW SHE WANTED TO DIE.

00:54.225 --> 00:57.528
HER PLAN
WAS TO POUR HERSELF A GLASS

00:57.528 --> 00:59.730
OF HER FAVORITE CHARDONNAY,

00:59.730 --> 01:03.264
PUT ON
HER MOST STYLISH NIGHTGOWN

01:03.264 --> 01:08.499
AND LEAVE BEHIND A NOTE
ON EMBOSSED STATIONERY.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.703
YES, BREE HAD EVERYTHING
SHE NEEDED

01:12.703 --> 01:14.245
FOR AN ELEGANT DEATH.

01:14.245 --> 01:15.075
(click)

01:17.208 --> 01:19.610
EVERYTHING EXCEPT...

01:19.610 --> 01:21.712
(pounding on door)

01:21.712 --> 01:23.484
PRIVACY.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.516
(pounding continues)

01:25.516 --> 01:27.618
(sighs)

01:30.191 --> 01:34.525
THANK YOU, BUT I DON'T NEED
TURNDOWN SERVICE.

01:34.525 --> 01:36.727
COME BACK IN THE MORNING.

01:36.727 --> 01:38.869

01:44.104 --> 01:45.376

THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.708

BEN.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.818

TO STEAL FROM ME.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.150

02:01.452 --> 02:03.123

02:03.123 --> 02:06.197
I ONCE SLAPPED A WAITRESS
BECAUSE SHE FORGOT MY CROUTONS!

02:06.197 --> 02:08.127
YOU ARE DEAD.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.531
RENEE, PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO GO.

02:10.531 --> 02:11.902
EVER SINCE WE MET,

02:11.902 --> 02:14.435
YOU'VE BEEN SPOUTING
THOSE SUNDAY SCHOOL PHRASES,

02:14.435 --> 02:17.268
MAKING FOLKS THINK
YOU'RE THIS GRAND LADY.

02:17.268 --> 02:19.710
WELL, I GOT YOUR NUMBER NOW,
AND YOU ARE NOTHING

02:19.710 --> 02:23.614

02:27.478 --> 02:28.919
WHY DO YOU HAVE A GUN?

02:31.722 --> 02:34.725
BREE...

02:34.725 --> 02:36.156
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.759
WHY IS THERE A GUN
ON THE TABLE?

02:38.759 --> 02:41.262
(sighs)

02:44.935 --> 02:48.269
NO, DON'T READ THAT.

 YEAH, YOU COULD SAY THAT.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.348
HOW COULD YOU LET YOURSELF
GET INVOLVED IN THIS?

04:49.460 --> 04:51.291
TO BRING MY SHIRTS

04:51.291 --> 04:52.393

OF A REHAB CENTER

06:16.747 --> 06:19.580

10:09.039 --> 10:12.342
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING,
YOU'RE GOING WITHOUT CLOTHES.

10:12.342 --> 10:13.714
MIKE! WH-- (sighs)

10:13.714 --> 10:15.786
CAN YOU WAIT A SEC?

10:17.047 --> 10:20.220
IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'VE PACKED FOR A MONTH.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.621
THREE WEEKS.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.053
FELIX SET UP MEETINGS
WITH GALLERY OWNERS,

10:23.053 --> 10:25.926
AND THEN IF ALL GOES WELL,
WE CAN DISCUSS MOVING THERE.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.698
I'M NOT MOVING TO NEW YORK.

10:27.698 --> 10:28.829
WHY NOT?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.030
MY PLUMBING BUSINESS
IS HERE.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.862
WELL, THINK HOW MUCH MORE
EXCITING IT'LL BE.

10:31.862 --> 10:34.765
YOU'LL BE UNCLOGGING PIPES
IN THE BIG CITY.

10:34.765 --> 10:37.938
OKAY, JUST STOP. THIS IS NOT
ABOUT YOU BECOMING AN ARTIST.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.110
IT'S NOT?
 NO.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.713
IT'S ABOUT YOU RUNNING
AWAY FROM CHUCK VANCE.

10:42.713 --> 10:45.776
(sighs)

10:45.776 --> 10:48.779
OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:48.779 --> 10:49.880
I'M A MESS.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.722
ONE MORE INTERROGATION
BY CHUCK,

10:51.722 --> 10:54.154
AND I WILL CRACK LIKE AN EGG,
AND THEN I'LL GO TO JAIL

10:54.154 --> 10:56.226
AND TAKE HALF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WITH ME.

10:56.226 --> 10:59.089
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T RISK IT.

10:59.089 --> 11:02.733
YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO.

11:02.733 --> 11:05.195
(sighs)

11:05.195 --> 11:08.138
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:08.138 --> 11:11.702
OH, MY GOD. CHUCK'S DEAD?

11:11.702 --> 11:14.975
IT WAS SOME SORT OF HIT AND RUN.
THAT'S--THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.949
SO... WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

11:18.949 --> 11:20.380
NOTHING. IT'S ALL GOOD.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.853
THE ONLY PERSON TYING US
TO ALEJANDRO'S MURDER IS GONE.

11:22.853 --> 11:25.315
GABY, HE WAS BREE'S BOYFRIEND.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.057
YEAH, AND IF SHE'D DUMPED HIM
WHEN I TOLD HER,

11:27.057 --> 11:29.059
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
IN TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:29.059 --> 11:31.091
IF YOU'RE DONE,
I THINK IT'S TIME

11:31.091 --> 11:33.063
THAT WE ASK
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION.

11:33.063 --> 11:34.164
WHICH IS?

11:34.164 --> 11:36.296
DID SOMEBODY DO THIS
ON PURPOSE?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.701
OH, MY GOD.
HE WAS MURDERED?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.804
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.877
IT DOES SEEM A BIT...
CONVENIENT.

11:46.877 --> 11:49.840
WELL, MAYBE GOD DECIDED
TO ANSWER OUR PRAYERS

11:49.840 --> 11:52.082
THROUGH ONE OF HIS
DRUNK-DRIVING ANGELS ON EARTH.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.944
(singsongy)
WHO ARE WE TO QUESTION GOD?

11:55.385 --> 11:58.248
LOOK, OKAY, I ADMIT WE WERE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE THERE,

11:58.248 --> 12:01.251
BUT NONE OF US
ARE THAT COLD-BLOODED, RIGHT?

12:04.394 --> 12:06.296
COULD IT BE SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO PROTECT US?

12:06.296 --> 12:08.298
OH, MY GOD. CARLOS.

12:08.298 --> 12:09.760
HEY.
 CARLOS COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.902
HE'S STILL IN REHAB, ISN'T HE?

12:12.803 --> 12:15.405
OF COURSE HE IS!
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.

12:15.405 --> 12:18.508
WE FINALLY GET A LUCKY BREAK.
LET'S JUST GO WITH IT.

12:18.508 --> 12:19.810
WE WANTED CHUCK GONE,
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.511
IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.

12:21.511 --> 12:22.973
COINCIDENCE?

12:22.973 --> 12:25.015
YES, BREE,
COINCIDENCES HAPPEN,

12:25.015 --> 12:27.477
OTHERWISE THERE WOULDN'T BE
A WORD FOR THEM.

12:27.477 --> 12:30.750
SO, UH, I GUESS WE SHOULD JUST
PUT THIS BEHIND US

12:30.750 --> 12:33.784
AND... GET BACK TO NORMAL.

12:33.784 --> 12:35.755
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.927
ARE WE GOOD, SUSAN?

12:36.927 --> 12:39.830
SURE.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.531
BREE?

12:43.133 --> 12:45.936
WE ALL AGREE THIS WAS
JUST AN ACCIDENT?

12:48.498 --> 12:50.770
IF YOU SAY SO.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.484
TOM?
TOM, I'VE GOT BIG NEWS!

13:04.484 --> 13:08.358
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO--

13:08.358 --> 13:09.860
BOB?

13:09.860 --> 13:12.362
WHAT DID YOU DO?
 HUH?

13:12.362 --> 13:14.194
YOU BURIED A MAN
IN THE WOODS?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.426
SHE WAS MERELY HELPING A FRIEND.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

13:16.426 --> 13:18.328
YOU T-TOLD BOB?

13:18.328 --> 13:19.930
OF COURSE I TOLD BOB.
IF THEY ARREST YOU,

13:19.930 --> 13:21.331
YOU'RE GONNA NEED AN ATTORNEY.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.233
TOM, I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT EVERYBODY I INVITED

13:23.233 --> 13:25.535
TO MY LAST BARBECUE
IS INVOLVED IN MURDER,

13:25.535 --> 13:26.877
AND THIS IS WATER.

13:26.877 --> 13:28.808
SCOTCH. COMING RIGHT UP.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.211
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
WE DON'T NEED A LAWYER.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.213
WE HAVE TO PREPARE
FOR THE WORST, LYNETTE.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.445
I AM NOT GONNA HAVE THE KIDS
VISIT YOU BEHIND BARS

13:35.445 --> 13:37.047
NEXT MOTHER'S DAY.
 NO, NO, LISTEN TO ME.

13:37.047 --> 13:38.889
CHUCK VANCE DIED LAST NIGHT.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.490
WHAT?

13:40.490 --> 13:41.551
HIT BY A CAR.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.823
OH, MY GOD!
WAS THAT YOU GUYS, TOO?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.355
NO!

13:45.355 --> 13:47.257
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:47.257 --> 13:49.399
AND--AND CHUCK WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNEW ABOUT THE...

13:49.399 --> 13:51.161
YEAH.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.963
(sighs) OKAY.

13:54.504 --> 13:56.506
(sighs)

13:56.506 --> 14:00.210
SO, BOB...

14:00.210 --> 14:02.112
I GUESS WE'RE NOT GONNA
NEED YOU AFTER ALL.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.976
BUT IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN TOTALLY
BILL ME FOR THIS HOUR.

14:05.976 --> 14:08.418
COUNT ON IT.

14:08.418 --> 14:11.481
TAKING THIS SCOTCH.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.984
(door opens and closes)

14:13.984 --> 14:15.625
SO IT'S OVER?

14:15.625 --> 14:17.627
I THINK SO.

14:22.332 --> 14:25.335
(crunching)

14:27.998 --> 14:30.070
OKAY, WHAT'S WRONG?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.301
HUH?

14:31.301 --> 14:34.174
THE ONE MAN WHO COULD HAVE
PUT US ALL IN JAIL IS GONE.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.046
WE'RE HOME FREE, BUT YOU'RE
STILL SITTING THERE,

14:36.046 --> 14:37.577
MORE DEPRESSED THAN EVER.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.209
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

14:39.209 --> 14:42.252
I DON'T KNOW.

14:42.252 --> 14:45.155
ARE YOU... UPSET
THAT CHUCK GOT KILLED?

14:45.155 --> 14:47.217
A LITTLE.

14:47.217 --> 14:48.388
NOT SO MUCH.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.360
WELL, THEN WHY ARE YOU
GETTING ALL MISTY?

14:50.360 --> 14:52.362
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

14:52.362 --> 14:53.893
WHYDON'TYOU?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.395
WHY ARE YOU GETTING MAD?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.597
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN RIDING
THIS EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER

14:57.597 --> 15:00.400
FOR MONTHS NOW,
AND I'M READY TO GET OFF.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.205
WELL, I'M SORRY IF I'M NOT
ALL GIGGLES AND SUNSHINE,

15:05.205 --> 15:07.907
BUT I AM WALKING AROUND
WITH A PRETTY BIG SECRET.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.140
SO WHAT?
EVERYBODY'S GOT A SECRET.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.313
NOT AS BIG AS MINE.
I HELPED BURY A BODY.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.544
AND OUR MECHANIC DOES
CRYSTAL METH.

15:14.544 --> 15:16.346
OUR BUTCHER BEATS UP
HOMELESS GUYS,

15:16.346 --> 15:17.547
AND THE LIBRARIAN'S
A NYMPHOMANIAC.

15:17.547 --> 15:19.519
THE WORLD IS FILLED

15:19.519 --> 15:22.452
WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE
THAT DO NASTY THINGS.

15:22.452 --> 15:25.055
SO MAN UP
OR DUMP THE GUILT.

15:25.055 --> 15:27.057
LET'S GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.232
(sighs)

15:32.232 --> 15:35.335
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.
UH...

15:38.338 --> 15:43.043
IT MAKES NO SENSE
FOR ME TO BE DEPRESSED,

15:43.043 --> 15:45.976
AND I KNOW ALEJANDRO
WAS A BAD GUY.

15:45.976 --> 15:48.148
AND HE DESERVED TO DIE.

15:48.148 --> 15:52.082
HE DID. HE ABSOLUTELY DID.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.986
WHY ARE YOU STILL SO...

15:55.986 --> 15:57.657
I DON'T KNOW.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.731
BUT I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
I SWEAR.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.136
THANK YOU.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.501
OUR LIBRARIAN'S
A NYMPHOMANIAC?

16:11.501 --> 16:12.742
I MADE THAT UP.

16:12.742 --> 16:14.044
'CAUSE I ALWAYS GOT A VIBE.

16:14.044 --> 16:17.007
LET'S JUST EAT.

16:17.007 --> 16:19.749
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

16:19.749 --> 16:22.412
DETECTIVE MURPHY?
 YEAH.

16:22.412 --> 16:26.486
HI. I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY
AND SAY HOW SORRY I WAS

16:26.486 --> 16:28.988
TO HEAR ABOUT OFFICER VANCE.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.422
IT'S SO TRAGIC. ANY IDEA
WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS?

16:32.422 --> 16:33.493
WHO ARE YOU?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.395
OH, I'M GABRIELLE SOLIS.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.597
I MET CHUCK THROUGH HIS
GIRLFRIEND, BREE VAN DE KAMP.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.399
SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.671
WOMAN'S A FIRST CLASS BITCH.

16:41.671 --> 16:46.476
WHO I RARELY TALK TO
'CAUSE OF THE BITCH THING.

16:46.476 --> 16:51.081
AHEM. SO, UM, WERE THERE
ANY WITNESSES?

16:51.081 --> 16:53.113
EVERYONE HERE KNOWS
WHAT SHE DID TO CHUCK--

16:53.113 --> 16:56.316
LED HIM ON AND THEN BROKE
HIS HEART LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.218
CAN'T BELIEVE HE WANTED
TO MARRY HER.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.750
YEAH, I KNOW. MARRYING BREE
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORST THING

17:00.750 --> 17:02.252
TO EVER HAPPEN TO HIM.

17:03.753 --> 17:05.525
WELL, SECOND WORST.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.228
SO ANY CLUES--
ANYTHING AT ALL?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.460
NOT YET. EXCUSE ME.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.502
UM...

17:12.502 --> 17:14.404
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK HAPPENED?

17:14.404 --> 17:16.736
DRUNK TEENAGERS
HITTING PEOPLE WITH CARS.
 YEAH.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.608
IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE
WITH THEM, LIKE SPRING BREAK.

17:19.608 --> 17:21.471
IF I WERE YOU GUYS,
I'D BE CHECKING THE GRILLS

17:21.471 --> 17:24.773
OF EVERY ACNE-COVERED KID
WITHIN A 100-MILE RADIUS.

17:24.773 --> 17:26.445
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.548
IT WASN'T?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.280
THERE WERE NO SKID MARKS,

17:30.280 --> 17:32.352
NO ATTEMPT TO SLOW DOWN
OR SWERVE.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.484
WHOEVER DID THIS
WAS GUNNING FOR CHUCK.

17:34.484 --> 17:38.588
SO... ANYONE GET
THE MAKE OF THE CAR

17:38.588 --> 17:41.261
OR... RACE OF THE DRIVER?

17:41.261 --> 17:44.834
NO, MA'AM, BUT WE'RE MONITORING
EVERY BODY SHOP IN THE STATE.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.697
OH. OKAY.

17:47.697 --> 17:50.840
DON'T WORRY.
A COP WAS KILLED.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.372
WE'LL FIND
WHOEVER'S RESPONSIBLE,

17:52.372 --> 17:56.346
AND WHEN WE DO, THEY ARE
GONNA PAY, BIG-TIME.

17:56.346 --> 17:58.278
OKAY.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.110
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL BREE.

18:01.651 --> 18:03.683
THAT BITCH!

18:12.562 --> 18:14.464
HOW'S THE HISTORY PROJECT
COMING?

18:14.464 --> 18:18.398
GOOD. I'M DRAWING A PICTURE
OF LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION.

18:18.398 --> 18:22.172
UM... SWEETIE, I DON'T THINK
HE WAS SHOT WITH A STAPLER.

18:22.172 --> 18:25.475
THAT'S A GUN,
AND I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

18:25.475 --> 18:27.177
(doorbell rings)

18:31.641 --> 18:33.783
SORRY FOR JUST DROPPING BY
WITHOUT CALLING,

18:33.783 --> 18:37.247
ESPECIALLY WITH THE WAY THINGS
HAVE BEEN BETWEEN US LATELY.

18:37.247 --> 18:40.150
WHAT'S WRONG?
 IT'S THIS WHOLE CHUCK THING.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.352
HEY, PENNY, WOULD YOU MIND
THROWING THOSE CLOTHES

18:42.352 --> 18:44.324
IN THE WASHING MACHINE
FOR ME?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.125
SURE.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.427
THANKS.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.698
COME ON IN.

18:48.698 --> 18:51.401
(sighs)

18:51.401 --> 18:53.833
YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT, DO YOU?
 NO.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.235
WHO COULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.866
IT HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO WAS
TRYING TO PROTECT US.

18:56.866 --> 18:59.439
BUT THAT MEANS THEY WOULD
HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE DID.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.442
WHO ELSE KNOWS? I MEAN, OTHER
THAN THE FOUR OF US AND CARLOS?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.174
WELL, SUSAN TOLD MIKE.

19:04.174 --> 19:06.176
AND I TOLD BEN.
 AND I TOLD TOM.

19:06.176 --> 19:07.917
YOU TOLD TOM?
 WELL, YOU TOLDBEN.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.180
OKAY, SO BEN AND MIKE AND TOM,
BUT THAT'S IT, RIGHT?

19:10.180 --> 19:12.182
NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN TOLD?

19:12.182 --> 19:14.153
NO ONE.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.355
EXCEPT TOM TOLD BOB.

19:15.355 --> 19:19.359
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO WRITE THIS DOWN.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.232
OKAY, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE
ARE IN ORANGE.

19:22.232 --> 19:24.234
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TOLD
BY PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE

19:24.234 --> 19:27.237
ARE IN BLUE,
AND THE GREEN ARROWS REPRESENT

19:27.237 --> 19:28.238
WHO TOLD WHOM.

19:28.238 --> 19:29.869
WOW. WE MAY BE GOOD
AT ARTS AND CRAFTS,

19:29.869 --> 19:31.871
BUT WE SUCK AT CONSPIRACY.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.172
WHAT'S THE PURPLE
QUESTION MARK?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.674
THAT'S WHOEVER WROTE
THE LETTER.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.946
YOU THINK THEY KILLED CHUCK?

19:36.946 --> 19:38.348
WHO KNOWS? WE'RE NOT SURE
WHY THE LETTER WAS SENT

19:38.348 --> 19:39.809
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:39.809 --> 19:41.951
"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
IT MAKES ME SICK.

19:41.951 --> 19:44.654
I'M GOING TO TELL"?
SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT TO ME.

19:44.654 --> 19:46.816
BUT WHY KILL SOMEONE ELSE
WHO HAS THE SAME GOAL?

19:46.816 --> 19:48.658
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

19:48.658 --> 19:52.722
NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE.
I MEAN, WE KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

19:52.722 --> 19:56.496
NONE OF THEM WOULD COMMIT
A COLD-BLOODED MURDER.

19:57.727 --> 19:59.369
OH, GOD.

19:59.369 --> 20:01.931
WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS?

20:07.977 --> 20:09.409
(sighs)

20:09.409 --> 20:12.342
HEY. HOW ARE THE GIRLS?

20:12.342 --> 20:14.414
JUANITA DEMANDED ICE CREAM
FOR LUNCH.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.647
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
 SHE'S BIGGER THAN ME.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SAID?

20:18.848 --> 20:20.250
AND DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.422
YOU SAID YOU'D BE HOME
BY FEEDING TIME.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.425
SORRY. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER TOWN
LOOKING FOR MY HUSBAND.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.796
CARLOS WENT A.W.O.L.
FROM REHAB LAST NIGHT,

20:26.796 --> 20:28.758
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

20:28.758 --> 20:29.859
WANT A HINT?

20:29.859 --> 20:31.631
YOU KNOW?

20:31.631 --> 20:34.364
HE DRAGGED HIS CAN UPSTAIRS
ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO,

20:34.364 --> 20:36.936
DRUNK AS A RED SOX PITCHER
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 9th.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.339
KAREN, I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO THANK YOU.

20:39.339 --> 20:44.274
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.
LET'S USE OUR IMAGINATION?

20:44.274 --> 20:46.976
(gasps) OH, THANK GOD!
I WAS SO WORRIED!

20:46.976 --> 20:48.278
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

20:48.278 --> 20:49.949
YOU CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH.
I WON'T JUDGE.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.382
I'LL BE TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE.

20:52.382 --> 20:54.324
(groans)

20:54.324 --> 20:55.885
WAKE UP,
YOU PATHETIC BOOZEHOUND!

20:55.885 --> 20:57.587
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?!

20:57.587 --> 20:58.688
OH, WHERE AM INOW?

20:58.688 --> 21:01.391
OHH! I'M HOME!

21:01.391 --> 21:03.893
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
OPEN YOUR EYES. FOCUS.

21:03.893 --> 21:06.035
OKAY, AFTER YOU CHECKED YOURSELF
OUT OF REHAB,

21:06.035 --> 21:08.438
YOU GOT IN THE CAR.
WHERE DID YOU GO?

21:08.438 --> 21:10.370
I DROVE TO A BAR.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.543
I DRANK A LOT OF SHOTS...

21:13.543 --> 21:16.376
AND I DON'T REMEMBER
MUCH ELSE.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.947
DO YOU REMEMBER
KILLING SOMEONE?

21:17.947 --> 21:19.479
HUH?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.781
OH, LOOK WHO'S SOBER NOW.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.313
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:23.313 --> 21:24.714
(sighs) CHUCK VANCE
WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT

21:24.714 --> 21:26.356
BY A HIT AND RUN DRIVER.

21:26.356 --> 21:28.358
CHUCK'S DEAD?

21:29.559 --> 21:30.860
AND YOU THINK I DID IT?

21:30.860 --> 21:32.392
WELL...

21:32.392 --> 21:34.624
YOU THINK I KILLED SOMEONE?

21:34.624 --> 21:36.366
AHEM. ALEJANDRO.

21:36.366 --> 21:38.728
IT'S NOT LIKE POTATO CHIPS,
GABY!

21:38.728 --> 21:40.069
YOU WERE UPSET,
AND YOU WERE DRINKING.

21:40.069 --> 21:41.531
HE WAS HIT ON LAKE STREET.

21:41.531 --> 21:44.404
THAT'S ONLY A FEW BLOCKS
FROM THE REHAB CENTER.

21:46.906 --> 21:47.907
I DON'T REMEMBER.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.078
YOU HAVE TO.

21:49.078 --> 21:50.880
THE POLICE ARE ALL OVER
THIS THING.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.444
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WITNESSES.
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE CAR.

21:56.386 --> 21:58.418
OH, WAIT. THAT'S IT.
THE CAR.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.619
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS CHECK THE CAR.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.591
IF YOU HIT HIM,
IT'LL BE OBVIOUS.

22:03.453 --> 22:08.628
(whirs)

22:08.628 --> 22:10.530
HONEY, WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

22:10.530 --> 22:14.063
THAT'S
AREALLYGOOD QUESTION.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.510
(switch clicks)

22:20.510 --> 22:21.571
(gulps)

22:21.571 --> 22:23.873
(sighs)

22:23.873 --> 22:26.676
WHY DID YOU TURN
THE LIGHT ON?

22:26.676 --> 22:29.348
I'M CHECKING UP ON YOU.
HOW YOU DOING?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.620
FINE.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.751
REALLY?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.823
'CAUSE LAST NIGHT
YOU WERE SUICIDAL,

22:33.823 --> 22:35.024
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
YOU FOUND OUT

22:35.024 --> 22:37.356
YOUR BOYFRIEND WAS DEAD.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.128
I WOULD THINK YOU'D BE
AN EMOTIONAL MESS

22:39.128 --> 22:41.531
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

22:41.531 --> 22:43.132
IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING
COUPLE OF DAYS,

22:43.132 --> 22:44.934
BUT I'M HOLDING MY OWN.

22:46.896 --> 22:50.500
SEE, HERE'S MY PROBLEM.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.141
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

22:52.141 --> 22:53.903
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

22:53.903 --> 22:55.545
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TURN OFF THE LIGHT

22:55.545 --> 22:57.507
AS YOU LEAVE THE ROOM.

22:57.507 --> 23:00.079
BREE, YOU NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.852
REPRESSING YOUR FEELINGS
IS NOT HEALTHY.

23:02.852 --> 23:06.586
AND SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU A THERAPIST?

23:06.586 --> 23:09.459
UH, EXCUSE ME.
I TOOK INTRO TO PSYCH

23:09.459 --> 23:12.462
AND ONCE SLEPT WITH MY SHRINK.
I THINK I'M QUALIFIED.

23:12.462 --> 23:14.464
WELL, AS IMPRESSIVE
AS THOSE CREDENTIALS ARE,

23:14.464 --> 23:17.096
MY FEELINGS
ARE NOT YOUR CONCERN.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.168
THEY BECAME MY CONCERN
WHEN I CAUGHT YOU

23:19.168 --> 23:23.533
ABOUT TO SWALLOW THE BUSINESS
END OF A SMITH & WESSON.

23:23.533 --> 23:27.537
NOW I'M NOT LEAVING THIS ROOM
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHY.

23:29.479 --> 23:32.111
I CAN'T.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.815
OTHER PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED--
PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.988
WELL... I CAN KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.951
RENEE...

23:41.951 --> 23:45.054
OH, YOU CAN TRUST ME.
WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

23:45.054 --> 23:47.457
NOT REALLY.

23:47.457 --> 23:49.459
NOT REALLY?

23:49.459 --> 23:52.431
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE.
YES, I MEAN, WE'RE--

23:52.431 --> 23:54.003
WELL, WE SOCIALIZE.
YOU'VE BEEN TO MY HOME.

23:54.003 --> 23:55.605
I'VE BEEN TO YOURS.
WE'RE FRIENDLY,

23:55.605 --> 23:58.437
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE US FRIENDS.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.042
OKAY.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.213
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

24:04.213 --> 24:06.516
YOU AND I DON'T TALK
ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS.

24:06.516 --> 24:09.178
WE'VE NEVER HAD
A DEEP CONVERSATION.

24:09.178 --> 24:10.480
WE'RE NOT...

24:10.480 --> 24:12.752
FRIENDS.

24:12.752 --> 24:16.455
(sighs) AND NOW I'VE UPSET YOU,
AND THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.689
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M FINE.

24:21.931 --> 24:23.232
(sighs)

24:23.232 --> 24:25.535
(sighs) AND BY THE WAY,

24:25.535 --> 24:27.567
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ANY FRIENDS.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.169
IN FACT, I DON'T THINK YOU CARE
ABOUT ANYONE AT ALL,

24:30.169 --> 24:32.471
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED

24:32.471 --> 24:34.003
SPLATTERING YOUR BRAINS
AGAINST THE WALL

24:34.003 --> 24:35.775
OF SOME CHEAP MOTEL.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.478
OKAY, THAT'S IT. WOULD YOU
PLEASE GET OUT OF MY HOUSE?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.151
NO! NOT UNTIL I'M CONVINCED
YOU ARE NO LONGER

24:42.151 --> 24:44.554
A DANGER TO YOURSELF.

24:44.554 --> 24:46.556
I WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE
TO KILL THEMSELVES,

24:46.556 --> 24:48.988
NOT ON MY WATCH.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.891
I WILL NOT GO THROUGH THAT
AGAIN.

24:56.826 --> 24:57.897
(switch clicks)

25:09.078 --> 25:12.642
(organ playing)

25:18.517 --> 25:19.849
(lowered voice)
THIS IS A FUNERAL.

25:19.849 --> 25:22.692
YOU HAVE GOT TO
STOP SMILING.

25:22.692 --> 25:24.123
(lowered voice) SORRY.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.656
I'M JUST SO RELIEVED.

25:26.656 --> 25:29.258
I REALLY THOUGHT
I WAS DEAD IN THE WATER THERE.

25:29.258 --> 25:32.131
YEAH, WE WERE VERY LUCKY.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.263
LISTEN,
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH

25:34.263 --> 25:36.606
FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
DONE FOR ME.

25:36.606 --> 25:38.007
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

25:38.007 --> 25:40.169
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE BOARDING
A PLANE TO PARIS,

25:40.169 --> 25:43.312
THEN THE NEXT,
YOU RUSH TO MY SIDE.

25:43.312 --> 25:46.916
WELL, YOU DO KNOW
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING,

25:46.916 --> 25:49.078
YOU STILL MEAN
THE WORLD TO ME?

25:49.078 --> 25:52.982
IF I DIDN'T BEFORE,
I DO NOW.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.091
HEY, I-I KNOW IT'S NOT PARIS,

26:02.091 --> 26:06.736
BUT YOU WANNA COME OVER LATER
FOR MOVIE NIGHT WITH THE KIDS?

26:06.736 --> 26:10.199
THAT'D BE GREAT.

26:10.199 --> 26:12.942
I'LL BRING A PIZZA
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK.

26:12.942 --> 26:14.704
FANTASTIC.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.309
LYNETTE.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.082
SORRY.

26:25.214 --> 26:27.887
(sighs)

26:30.720 --> 26:31.691
(sniffles)

26:34.093 --> 26:35.825
HERE YOU GO, DEAR.

26:35.825 --> 26:37.627
OH. THANK YOU.

26:37.627 --> 26:40.830
I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT
TO BRING TISSUE TO A FUNERAL.

26:40.830 --> 26:43.833
OH, YOU KEEP IT. I DON'T
REALLY CRY AT FUNERALS,

26:43.833 --> 26:45.074
NOT ANYMORE.

26:45.074 --> 26:46.636
NO?

26:46.636 --> 26:47.977
NO. WELL, WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,

26:47.977 --> 26:50.209
DEATH ALWAYS COMES
AS SUCH A SHOCK,

26:50.209 --> 26:53.112
AS IF THE UNIVERSE
IS UNFAIR.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.114
BUT WHEN YOU GET TO MY AGE,

26:55.114 --> 26:59.388
YOU REALIZE THAT DEATH IS JUST
THE END OF THE STORY.

26:59.388 --> 27:00.850
(sighs)

27:00.850 --> 27:03.252
THE PHONE CALL COMES.

27:03.252 --> 27:05.354
YOU SHED A FEW TEARS,

27:05.354 --> 27:06.896
AND THEN YOU GET TOGETHER

27:06.896 --> 27:09.799
AND CELEBRATE
THE LIFE THAT WAS.

27:09.799 --> 27:11.130
THAT'SIT.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.131
WHAT?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.833
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

27:13.833 --> 27:16.736
YOU WILL NEVER KNOW
HOW HELPFUL YOU'VE BEEN.

27:16.736 --> 27:17.867
OH, I'M SO GLAD.

27:17.867 --> 27:18.868
(sighs)

27:18.868 --> 27:21.040
WERE YOU CLOSE
WITH MY NEPHEW?

27:21.040 --> 27:23.042
OH, NO.
 OH.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.745
AH. BUT HE DID
INTERROGATE ME ONCE.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.116
HE DID A LOVELY JOB.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.783
(congregants murmuring)

27:33.783 --> 27:37.727
HEY, GABY,
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

27:37.727 --> 27:39.058
(lowered voice) LISTEN.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.360
WHAT WAS ALEJANDRO'S ALIAS?

27:41.360 --> 27:42.832
(whispering) SERIOUSLY?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS HERE?

27:42.832 --> 27:44.794
CHUCK TOLD ME
IN MY INTERROGATION,

27:44.794 --> 27:45.865
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.798
PABLO? PACO?
 RAMON SANCHEZ.

27:48.798 --> 27:50.770
RIGHT, RIGHT,
AND HE WAS LIVING IN...

27:50.770 --> 27:53.272
(lowered voice) OKLAHOMA CITY.
WHAT DO YOU NEED THIS FOR?

27:53.272 --> 27:56.245
I... W-WANNA LIGHT
A CANDLE FOR HIM,

27:56.245 --> 27:58.277
AND I THOUGHT I SHOULD KNOW
ALL OF HIS NAMES.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.710
YOU ONLY LIGHT CANDLES FOR
PEOPLE WHO YOU WANT TO BLESS.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.081
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND HE WAS A BAD GUY.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.784
I'M GONNA GO BLOW OUT
THAT CANDLE.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.121
(lowered voice) WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?

28:12.121 --> 28:14.463
THERE ARE COPS EVERYWHERE.

28:14.463 --> 28:16.896
IT'S A COP FUNERAL.
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT? CLOWNS?

28:16.896 --> 28:19.298
I AM TAKING A HUGE RISK
BY BEING HERE.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.800
NO,
YOU'RE PAYING YOUR RESPECTS.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.273
THAT'S WHAT
INNOCENT PEOPLE DO.

28:24.273 --> 28:26.235
OKAY.

28:26.235 --> 28:27.777
IF I'M SO INNOCENT,

28:27.777 --> 28:30.880
THEN WHY IS THAT COP
STARING AT ME?

28:32.211 --> 28:34.483
JUST STOP ACTING SO GUILTY.

28:34.483 --> 28:35.885
HE TAKES ONE LOOK
AT YOUR FACE,

28:35.885 --> 28:38.387
AND YOU SAY--
HI, OFFICER.

28:38.387 --> 28:41.891
HELLO. CARLOS, RIGHT?
REMEMBER ME?

28:41.891 --> 28:43.793
NO.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.925
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
YOU WERE PRETTY WASTED

28:45.925 --> 28:49.228
WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE STATION
THE OTHER NIGHT.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.200
(clenches teeth) YOU WENT
TO THE POLICE STATION?

28:51.200 --> 28:53.262
YEAH. HE SAID HE WANTED
TO MAKE A CONFESSION--

28:53.262 --> 28:56.465
SOMETHING ABOUT BEATING SOMEBODY
WITH A CANDLESTICK?

28:57.907 --> 29:01.270
OH, CARLOS, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.242
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.975
WELL, THAT'S WHEN THE NEWS
CAME IN ABOUT DETECTIVE VANCE,

29:05.975 --> 29:07.817
AND, UH, ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

29:07.817 --> 29:11.851
BY THE TIME THINGS SETTLED,
HE WAS GONE.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.953
SO WHO'S THIS PERSON
YOU ASSAULTED?

29:13.953 --> 29:16.926
OH! UH...

29:16.926 --> 29:18.157
THAT WOULD BE ME.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.859
YOU?

29:19.859 --> 29:23.933
YEAH. I'M A BIT
OF A HANDFUL.

29:23.933 --> 29:26.235
YOU HIT YOUR WIFE
WITH A CANDLESTICK?

29:26.235 --> 29:27.937
HE HIT ME BACK.

29:27.937 --> 29:30.870
IN HIS DEFENSE, I'D JUST
POPPED HIM WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

29:33.102 --> 29:37.206
SO DO YOU WANNA FILE CHARGES?

29:37.206 --> 29:38.447
OR DO YOU?

29:38.447 --> 29:40.910
OH! WE'RE GOOD.

29:40.910 --> 29:44.283
THIS THING WE GOT
ISN'T PRETTY, BUT IT WORKS.

29:51.260 --> 29:54.223
SO WHO WAS IT?

29:54.223 --> 29:56.295
WHO WAS WHAT?

29:58.097 --> 30:00.870
(lowered voice) THE PERSON
YOU KNEW WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE.

30:02.902 --> 30:07.206
THAT'S SOMETHING I ONLY
DISCUSS WITH FRIENDS.

30:13.482 --> 30:17.046
IT WAS MY MOTHER.

30:17.046 --> 30:18.988
SHE'D TRIED IT ONCE BEFORE.

30:18.988 --> 30:21.350
PILLS.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.392
BUT I FOUND HER IN TIME.

30:23.392 --> 30:28.497
AND THEN... ONE MORNING I SAW
THAT LOOK IN HER EYES AGAIN.

30:30.059 --> 30:33.502
NOT... SAD, JUST...

30:33.502 --> 30:35.204
EMPTY.

30:35.204 --> 30:39.909
SHE SWORE TO ME
SHE'D BE FINE, SO I...

30:39.909 --> 30:41.570
I WENT TO SCHOOL.

30:46.515 --> 30:49.178
AND BY THE TIME
I GOT BACK...

30:53.452 --> 30:54.924
(voice breaking) WELL...
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

30:54.924 --> 30:57.186
SHE WAS GONNA PULL IT OFF
THIS TIME?

30:59.858 --> 31:02.591
OH, RENEE,
I AM SO SORRY.

31:02.591 --> 31:07.036
(exhales) YEAH.

31:07.036 --> 31:09.638
THAT'S WHAT THE NOTE SAID--
"I'M SORRY."

31:11.240 --> 31:12.641
THAT'S IT.

31:14.643 --> 31:17.977
I DON'T HAVE A MOM
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

31:17.977 --> 31:21.450
AND SHE THINKS
THOSE TWO LITTLE WORDS...

31:21.450 --> 31:25.084
ARE GONNA MAKE UP FOR THAT?
(sighs)

31:31.490 --> 31:34.493
MANY YEARS AGO,

31:34.493 --> 31:38.067
A NEIGHBOR
AND A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS...

31:38.067 --> 31:40.429
TOOK HER LIFE.

31:42.101 --> 31:47.106
AND THAT LEFT US ALL
HEARTBROKEN AND PERPLEXED.

31:49.378 --> 31:55.084
BUT SOMEHOW, WHEN I WAS
ALONE IN THAT HOTEL ROOM,

31:55.084 --> 31:57.386
I FORGOT ABOUT ALL THE PAIN
SHE CAUSED.

31:59.989 --> 32:02.621
IN THOSE AWFUL MOMENTS,

32:02.621 --> 32:05.294
I THOUGHT MAYBE
SHE HAD THE ANSWER.

32:11.100 --> 32:15.164
BUT THEN YOU SHOWED UP.
THANK GOD.

32:19.138 --> 32:24.043
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
THE PERSON WHO SAVED MY LIFE.

32:24.043 --> 32:27.516
AND NOW THAT I'VE HAD TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT...

32:29.178 --> 32:33.082
I REALIZE THAT MAKES YOU
THE BEST FRIEND I'LL EVER HAVE.

32:40.289 --> 32:41.690
(sighs)

32:52.541 --> 32:53.602
(door opens)

32:53.602 --> 32:56.975
HEY! LOOK WHO'S HERE
WITH A PIZZA AND A DVD.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.248
OOH, MARIO'S.
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

32:59.248 --> 33:01.610
MOM, YOU LET DAD PICK OUT
THE MOVIE?

33:01.610 --> 33:05.084
HEY, MY TASTE IN MOVIES
IS AS GOOD AS MY TASTE IN PIZZA.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.755
GREAT, THAT MEANS THE PIZZA'S
GONNA BE BLACK AND WHITE

33:06.755 --> 33:07.986
AND THREE HOURS LONG.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.418
OH, EXCUSE ME.

33:09.418 --> 33:11.090
"CITIZEN KANE," "MARTY,"
"CASABLANCA"--

33:11.090 --> 33:13.122
WHAT DO ALL THESE MOVIES
HAVE IN COMMON?

33:13.122 --> 33:14.563
WE FELL ASLEEP DURING THEM?

33:14.563 --> 33:17.566
THEY'RE CLASSICS.

33:17.566 --> 33:19.598
"HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, KID."

33:19.598 --> 33:21.770
HERE'S LOOKING AT MY iPhone,
DAD.

33:21.770 --> 33:24.073
HEY! BE NICE.
I'M SURE YOUR DAD PICKED OUT

33:24.073 --> 33:26.435
SOMETHING REALLY FUN THIS TIME.
WHAT'D YOU GET?

33:26.435 --> 33:28.607
"OLD YELLER."

33:28.607 --> 33:31.380
OH, TOM,
YOU MAKE THIS SO HARD.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.342
WHY? WHAT I'VE SEEN OF IT
IS GREAT.

33:33.342 --> 33:35.644
MY FOLKS ALWAYS SENT ME
TO BED BEFORE THE ENDING.

33:35.644 --> 33:37.386
IS THERE--IS THERE
SWEARING OR SOMETHING?

33:37.386 --> 33:40.089
EH. SOMETHING.
HOW ABOUT WE EAT?

33:40.089 --> 33:43.152
HUH.

33:43.152 --> 33:45.594
EVERYTHING GOOD?

33:45.594 --> 33:51.660
YEAH. IT'S JUST, YOU NEVER
REMEMBER I LIKE THE THIN CRUST.

33:51.660 --> 33:54.103
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THANK YOU FOR GETTING IT.

33:54.103 --> 33:56.265
WHO'S HUNGRY?

33:56.265 --> 33:57.806
(Parker) MMM.
 (Penny) OH, I AM.

34:04.273 --> 34:06.415
GOOD NEWS.
THE POLICE FOUND THE CAR.

34:06.415 --> 34:08.377
YOU LEFT IT
IN THEIR PARKING LOT.

34:08.377 --> 34:09.717
THANK GOD.

34:09.717 --> 34:12.751
MRS. McCLUSKEY'S GONNA DRIVE US
OVER THERE AFTER BREAKFAST,

34:12.751 --> 34:15.484
THEN I WILL DRIVE YOU
BACK TO REHAB.

34:15.484 --> 34:18.726
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

34:18.726 --> 34:20.228
(switch clicks)

34:22.291 --> 34:23.661
(sighs)

34:25.694 --> 34:27.466
BABE.

34:30.099 --> 34:32.201
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

34:32.201 --> 34:34.803
I KNOW I'VE PUT YOU
AND THE KIDS THROUGH SO MUCH.

34:37.346 --> 34:39.447
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET BACK HERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.513
YOU FORGET ABOUT US.

34:44.513 --> 34:45.614
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT
GETTING BETTER.

34:45.614 --> 34:48.516
I CAN HOLD DOWN THE FORT.
NO PROBLEM.

34:59.228 --> 35:01.500
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

35:03.672 --> 35:05.804
WHAT'S THAT?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.436
I LOVE YOU.

35:09.538 --> 35:12.811
I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.244
I JUST DON'T THINK
WE SAY IT ENOUGH.

35:15.244 --> 35:17.546
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

35:25.554 --> 35:27.496
ONE MORE THING.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.430
WHAT?

35:31.430 --> 35:35.434
IF YOUEVERGO
TO THE POLICE AGAIN

35:35.434 --> 35:39.168
AND CONFESS SOMETHING
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST,

35:39.168 --> 35:42.541
I WILL BE BURYING
ANOTHER BODY IN THE WOODS.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.843
YOU GOT IT?

35:47.246 --> 35:48.747
GOOD.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.549
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.760
HEY, YOU WANT A BEER?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.662
OH,
YOU GOT THE BELGIAN KIND?

36:03.662 --> 36:04.933
I LOVE THATSTUFF.

36:04.933 --> 36:07.196
I KNOW.

36:07.196 --> 36:08.897
THANKS FOR CLEARING
THE TABLE.

36:08.897 --> 36:10.399
(bottle cap fizzes)
 I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN
THE HARDEST PART

36:10.399 --> 36:11.500
OF OUR SEPARATION.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.502
GOD, FOR ME?
IT'S THE LAUNDRY.

36:13.502 --> 36:16.475
I-I FOUND OUT I AM MORE
INCLINED TO BUY NEW SOCKS...

36:16.475 --> 36:19.348
AH.
 THAN TO WASH THE DIRTY ONES.

36:19.348 --> 36:21.610
HEY, THANKS AGAIN
FOR GIVING UP YOUR TRIP.

36:21.610 --> 36:23.612
IT REALLY MEANT A LOT
TO ME.

36:23.612 --> 36:26.585
NO PROBLEM.

36:26.585 --> 36:30.489
ANDPLEASE APOLOGIZE
TO JANE.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.291
SHE MUST BE FURIOUS.

36:32.291 --> 36:35.424
(chuckles) I DOUBT IT.
SHE'S NOT REALLY LIKE THAT.

36:35.424 --> 36:36.625
TOM, I KNOW WOMEN.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.196
THERE'S
A LYNETTE VOODOO DOLL

36:38.196 --> 36:40.629
BEING DROPPED OFF
THE EIFFEL TOWER AS WE SPEAK.

36:40.629 --> 36:43.602
(laughs) NO, IT'S WEIRD,
BUT, UH,

36:43.602 --> 36:45.234
JANE DOESN'T HANG ON
TO ANGER.

36:45.234 --> 36:47.836
AH. UH, OKAY.

36:47.836 --> 36:49.478
YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

36:49.478 --> 36:51.840
SHE'S--
SHE'S VERY FORGIVING.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.212
AH. FINE. GOT IT.
SHE'S TERRIFIC.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.215
WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU
AN EXAMPLE.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.688
SHE WOULD NEVER CRITICIZE
THE PIZZA I BROUGHT OVER.

36:59.688 --> 37:01.620
WHAT?

37:01.620 --> 37:05.894
WELL, YOU HAD TO POINT OUT THAT
I DIDN'T GET THE THIN CRUST.

37:05.894 --> 37:08.557
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THE SECOND I SAID IT,

37:08.557 --> 37:11.760
I REALIZED I SHOULDN'T HAVE.
IT JUST... CAME OUT.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.733
EXACTLY. IT'S JUST A--
IT'S A REFLEX FOR YOU.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.864
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

37:15.864 --> 37:20.569
WELL...

37:20.569 --> 37:22.511
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
I KEEP HOPING

37:22.511 --> 37:25.274
IF I SAY SOMETHING ENOUGH,
YOU'LL FINALLY HEAR ME.

37:25.274 --> 37:27.245
I MEAN...

37:29.478 --> 37:32.281
23 YEARS OF TELLING YOU
THE KIND OF PIZZA I LIKE,

37:32.281 --> 37:34.423
AND IT STILL DOESN'T OCCUR
TO YOU TO GET IT.

37:34.423 --> 37:37.286
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
I DON'T MATTER.

37:40.629 --> 37:43.562
WOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE.

37:43.562 --> 37:47.566
I KNOW.

37:50.439 --> 37:52.000
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
COMPARED YOU TO JANE.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.272
(sighs) THAT WASN'T RIGHT.

37:56.545 --> 37:58.447
THAT'S OKAY.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.314
SHE'S REALLY GOOD TO YOU,
HUH?

38:11.560 --> 38:12.761
(exhales deeply)

38:19.368 --> 38:21.700
THEN I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO TO PARIS.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.573
WHAT?

38:24.573 --> 38:26.475
YEAH.

38:28.837 --> 38:31.580
'CAUSE OTHERWISE,
YOU'LL ALWAYS WONDER

38:31.580 --> 38:34.613
IF SHE COULD MAKE YOU HAPPY.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.886
AND DIDN'T WE SAY THAT WAS
THE POINT OF US SEPARATING?

38:47.596 --> 38:49.958
COULD I STILL STAY
AND WATCH THE MOVIE?

38:52.531 --> 38:55.404
OF COURSE.

39:18.527 --> 39:20.689
(sighs) SUSAN?

39:20.689 --> 39:21.990
(door closes in distance)

39:29.968 --> 39:32.601
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

39:32.601 --> 39:33.972
(door opens)

39:33.972 --> 39:36.545
SUSAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

39:36.545 --> 39:38.547
OH, I REMEMBER THIS HOUSE.

39:38.547 --> 39:40.949
THE HALF NAKED GUY RUNS OUT,
AND I DON'T GET MY FARE.

39:40.949 --> 39:42.380
HERE. HUH?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.984
OH, NO, NO, PUT THAT BACK.
YOU'LL GET YOUR FARE THIS TIME.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.617
HONEY, I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

39:48.617 --> 39:50.088
I-IT'S ALL IN MY NOTE.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.090
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND NOTES LATELY?

39:52.090 --> 39:54.523
YOU WERE ASLEEP WHEN I CAME HOME
FROM THE FUNERAL.

39:54.523 --> 39:57.025
WELL, IF YOU'RE TAKING OFF
TO NEW YORK, YOU WAKE ME UP!

39:57.025 --> 39:58.166
(lowered voice)
I'M NOT GOING TO NEW YORK.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.568
I'M GOING TO OKLAHOMA.

39:59.568 --> 40:01.970
AND NOW I'M...
JUST CONFUSED.

40:01.970 --> 40:05.003
(sighs) OKAY, TWO MINUTES.

40:06.735 --> 40:09.137
(car door opens and closes)

40:09.137 --> 40:13.081
(sighs) YOU ASKED ME WHY
I STILL FEEL SO GUILTY.

40:13.081 --> 40:16.885
I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.
HE GOT A PHONE CALL.

40:16.885 --> 40:18.046
WHO GOT A PHONE CALL?

40:18.046 --> 40:19.848
ALEJANDRO.

40:19.848 --> 40:22.020
WHEN WE WERE PUTTING HIS BODY
INTO THE GROUND,

40:22.020 --> 40:25.053
HIS PHONE RANG.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

40:25.053 --> 40:27.756
HE HAD REALLY GOOD
CELL PHONE SERVICE?

40:27.756 --> 40:29.558
IT MEANS HE HAS A FAMILY,

40:29.558 --> 40:32.130
AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.832
IT MUST BE
TEARING THEM APART.

40:33.832 --> 40:38.136
I MEAN,HEDID
SOMETHING HORRIBLE, NOT THEM.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.138
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO SUFFER, TOO.

40:42.571 --> 40:45.143
AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

40:45.143 --> 40:47.976
I'M NOT SURE YET.

40:47.976 --> 40:52.781
I JUST KNOW I HAVE TO SEE
IF THEY'RE OKAY.

40:52.781 --> 40:54.122
I THINK IT'S THE ONLY WAY

40:54.122 --> 40:56.725
I'M EVER GETTING BACK
TO NORMAL.

40:56.725 --> 40:58.987
(sighs)

40:58.987 --> 41:02.891
(sighs) WELL, THEN I GUESS
YOU GOTTA GO.

41:02.891 --> 41:04.493
(sighs)

41:06.695 --> 41:08.036
(engine starts)

41:10.999 --> 41:12.641
(sighs)

41:26.615 --> 41:29.217
HEY! WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

41:29.217 --> 41:32.861
I'M JUST...
VISITING SOME FAMILY.

41:32.861 --> 41:35.163
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
WELL, HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

41:38.096 --> 41:42.130
IT'S A LONELY BUSINESS
KEEPING SECRETS.

41:42.130 --> 41:46.705
THAT'S WHY WE ALL SEARCH FOR
SOMEONE WE CAN CONFIDE IN...

41:49.778 --> 41:53.011
AN ALLY WHO WILL UNDERSTAND.

41:57.145 --> 42:00.749
AN ADVISOR WE CAN TRUST.

42:00.749 --> 42:02.250
(door opens)

42:02.250 --> 42:07.726
A FRIEND WHO WILL NEVER JUDGE.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.663
YES, WE ALL NEED HELP HIDING

42:14.663 --> 42:17.966
THE DARKEST TRUTHS
OF OUR LIVES.

42:19.738 --> 42:23.541
BECAUSE AS SOON
AS YOU'VE TOLD ONE SECRET...

42:27.315 --> 42:32.180
ANOTHER IS LIKELY TO APPEAR.
