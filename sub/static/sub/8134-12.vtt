♪♪

00:04.605 --> 00:06.705
We need blood.
So I've heard.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.173
Human blood.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.343
Everything's out of control.
We were fools
to believe Valentine was dead.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.012
[Jace] <i> Previously</i>
<i> on </i> Shadowhunters...

00:13.014 --> 00:14.847
My sister wants you
to be her defense attorney.

00:14.849 --> 00:15.948
For the right price.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.349
Name it.
You.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.118
[Jace] <i> Clary,</i>
<i> if you don't help us,</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.452
<i> no one survives.</i>
<i> Do you understand?</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:22.154
[Clary] <i> Mom, please, wake up.</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:24.456
You're out of order.
This whole thing
is out of order.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.059
I am your father, Clary.
And Jace's.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.627
They're brother and sister.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.062
That means they can't...

00:30.064 --> 00:32.698
You'll be lonely
all your life.
Neither of you deserve it.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.966
And I don't either.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.504
Bring the flowers
out to the wedding tent.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.740
Put the lilies up on the dais,
and lay the rose petals
at the entrance.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.009
Isabelle, which color
do you like better?

00:44.011 --> 00:46.245
It's for the curtains
adorning the wedding tent.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.746
Hmm.

00:47.748 --> 00:52.184
The cobalt blue.
It's elegant, masculine...
very Alec.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.520
[woman] I'll put
the cobalt blue out
right away.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.989
How are we supposed
to get any work done
with all this going on?

00:56.991 --> 00:59.058
[sighs] We haven't had
a wedding here in years.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.692
People are allowed
to be excited.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.361
We need to focus.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.996
Have you narrowed down
the list of warlocks

01:03.998 --> 01:05.831
more powerful
than Magnus Bane?

01:05.833 --> 01:08.500
[sighs] I've
got it down to 20.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.902
But it's gonna be
hard to figure out

01:09.904 --> 01:11.236
which one cast
that spell on Jocelyn.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.839
I don't care how tough it is,
we've gotta find him.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.507
Back at Renwick's,
I let Valentine go.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.109
I won't make
that mistake again.

01:17.111 --> 01:20.712
We gotta wake up Jocelyn,
in case she heard
anything about his plan.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.914
Have you spoken to Alec?

01:21.916 --> 01:23.849
He's probably busy,
what with
wedding plans and all.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.784
And I don't need
to talk to anyone.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.519
Let's just stick to
the mission, okay?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.368
She looks so peaceful now.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.972
I just wish I knew
how to reach her.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.107
She's gonna be fine.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.377
I'm sorry, Clary.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.213
We should have
told you everything
before this got--

01:54.215 --> 01:56.648
Luke, we can hash
all that out
when we wake Mom up.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.885
The important thing now
is that we have her back.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.122
I'm looking for Lydia.

02:03.124 --> 02:06.291
Have you seen her?
I don't mean to
interrupt your--

02:06.293 --> 02:08.627
No, stay for a minute.
I gotta get back
to the station.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.863
Call me if
anything changes?
Yeah.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.637
[sighs]

02:18.639 --> 02:19.972
So, how is she?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.740
The same, I guess.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.509
[inhales deeply]

02:23.511 --> 02:26.512
Alec, I know you and I
don't always see eye
to eye on things...

02:27.148 --> 02:29.781
Actually, we never see
eye to eye on anything,

02:29.783 --> 02:31.783
but I do want
to thank you

02:31.785 --> 02:33.819
for everything you've done
to get my mom back.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.322
Actually I...
I should thank you.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.692
I don't know what
would have happened
to Isabelle after the trial

02:40.694 --> 02:42.060
if you hadn't
returned the Cup.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.831
You saved my sister,
so thank you.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.767
[inhales deeply] Yeah,
my whole world
turned upside down,

02:48.769 --> 02:51.370
but, um, you and I
thanking each other...

02:51.372 --> 02:52.671
[chuckles softly]

02:52.673 --> 02:54.640
...that's...
that's too much.
[chuckles]

02:54.642 --> 02:56.275
[scoffs] Yeah.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.476
[cell phone vibrating]

02:57.478 --> 02:58.744
[sighs]

03:00.114 --> 03:01.513
Magnus needs
to speak with me.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.981
He might have
some information

03:02.983 --> 03:06.218
about how to wake
your mother up or...
stop Valentine.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.619
It's important.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.887
Mmm. Yeah.

03:14.662 --> 03:18.230
Hello... Magnus?
You said you
needed to talk to me.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.898
[Magnus] Nice
to see you, Alec.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.400
I wasn't sure if you'd come.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.870
You know how I
hate to drink alone.
[chuckles]

03:27.841 --> 03:29.708
I didn't come here
to drink.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.077
[sighs] Do you have
any information--

03:32.079 --> 03:34.146
On the warlock
who cast a spell
on Jocelyn?

03:34.148 --> 03:36.381
I'm looking into it.
But...

03:36.383 --> 03:39.751
we never really finished
our conversation
after Izzy's trial.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.987
About your wedding?

03:41.989 --> 03:45.324
There's no
conversation to be had.
I'm getting married.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.360
You and I,
we understand marriage
very differently.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.062
I'm a Shadowhunter.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.165
This is about family,
and tradition, honor--

03:53.167 --> 03:54.266
Honor?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.169
Where's the honor
in living a lie?

03:57.171 --> 03:58.403
What are you
talking about?

03:59.506 --> 04:01.106
What about love?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.109
Even Shadowhunters
fall in love, Alec.

04:05.713 --> 04:09.448
Just tell me you're
in love with Lydia,
and I'll stop.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.820
I don't know.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.256
Why do you
keep pushing?

04:17.258 --> 04:18.857
[stammering]

04:21.428 --> 04:22.995
You're confusing me.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.766
Confusion is
part of it.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.601
That's how you find out
if something's there.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.037
Emotions are
never black and white.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.140
They're more like
symptoms.

04:38.879 --> 04:42.247
You lose your breath
every time they
enter a room.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.082
[inhales deeply]

04:44.084 --> 04:45.284
[fingers snapping]
[exhales]

04:45.286 --> 04:48.186
Your heart beats
faster when they walk by.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.423
Your skin tingles
when they stand

04:51.425 --> 04:53.225
close enough to
feel their breath.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.327
[exhales]

05:01.568 --> 05:02.834
[sighs]

05:05.105 --> 05:07.472
I know you feel
what I feel, Alec.

05:08.309 --> 05:11.543
[scoffs] You don't have
any clue what I feel...

05:12.613 --> 05:13.812
so back off.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.984
This is all just
a game to you, isn't it?

05:19.953 --> 05:22.954
You flirt, you laugh,
you use magic,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.257
but at the end of the day,
what do you risk?

05:25.259 --> 05:27.993
Even if I did feel
something for you...

05:28.929 --> 05:30.329
you want me to give up
my life for you?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.631
I have to do
what's right for me.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.500
I could lose my family,
my career, everything!

05:38.105 --> 05:39.838
You just don't get it.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.374
You have a choice to make.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.246
I will not ask again.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.189
[ringing]

06:02.629 --> 06:03.962
Hey, Clary.
What's goin' on?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.997
I just, uh, needed
to hear your voice.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.399
Are you okay?
You sound upset.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.533
<i> Yeah, I'm fine. Just...</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:10.469
things are kind
of weird with Jace

06:10.471 --> 06:12.637
right now,
but we'll work it out.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.972
So how's your mom?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.308
I mean, I can't believe
you actually rescued her.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.478
We still have to wake her up,
but at least she's
away from Valentine.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.330
When can I see her?

06:21.331 --> 06:23.181
<i> How about tomorrow night?</i>
<i> She's here at the infirmary.</i>

06:23.183 --> 06:24.750
Plus, it's Alec's
wedding, so...

06:24.752 --> 06:26.451
[chuckles] I'd love if
you'd come as my date.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.020
Really? I...

06:29.022 --> 06:31.390
[stammers] See, I just assumed
you'd want to go with Jace.

06:31.392 --> 06:34.059
That's, uh... [sighs]
not really in
the cards right now.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.562
Besides, you are the person
I'm closest to in the world.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.698
<i> Please come.</i>
I'd love to.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.832
Um... [clears throat]

06:40.834 --> 06:42.334
But I might be
a little bit late,

06:42.336 --> 06:43.735
you know, with
the sun and all.
[chuckles]

06:43.737 --> 06:45.170
You are the best.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.505
<i> I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

06:46.507 --> 06:47.706
Yeah.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.075
[indistinct chatter]

06:51.678 --> 06:52.878
[Jace sighs]

06:52.880 --> 06:54.713
Morning.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.015
Morning. You just
come from training?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.618
Yeah. I'm, uh, workin'
on my right hook.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.520
Good. That's a good punch.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.722
Yeah. I'm, uh,
I'm workin' on it.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.058
While this conversation
is no doubt scintillating,

07:07.060 --> 07:09.060
remind me why we couldn't
do this at my place?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.729
At least there
we'd have cocktails.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.364
It's 9:00 in the morning.

07:12.366 --> 07:13.865
Oh, it's happy hour
somewhere, my dear.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.367
[Jace] We invited
you here, Magnus,

07:15.369 --> 07:17.135
because Hodge can't
leave the Institute.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.437
He's an important
part of this mission.

07:18.439 --> 07:21.440
Well, then, where is
our tardy little tutor?

07:21.442 --> 07:24.409
There are certain individuals
that I'd like to avoid,
so let's make this quick.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.710
[Hodge] Pardon
the delay, Magnus.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.046
I was following up
on a lead.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.884
Now, we've narrowed down
our list of warlocks
to these three.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.288
Why is Ragnor Fell up there?
He's not more
powerful than I am.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.423
Well, some would disagree.
He is older than you.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.959
Certainly not wiser.
Who is Ragnor Fell?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.561
[Jace] The former
High Warlock of London.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.596
And one of my
oldest friends.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.065
Very prickly,
likes to keep to himself.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.734
Okay, look.
We just need to figure out
which one of these warlocks

07:49.736 --> 07:52.737
had enough access to Jocelyn
that they could
create the potion for her

07:52.739 --> 07:55.440
without anyone discovering
what they'd done.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.075
By the early '90s,
Ragnor was a professor

07:57.077 --> 07:59.311
at the Shadowhunter
Academy in Idris.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.946
Isn't that when my
mother lived there?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.581
Could he have made
the potion for her?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.382
The little bugger!

08:04.384 --> 08:06.685
That's why
he hasn't responded
to my fire message.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.588
Ever since Valentine
began hunting warlocks,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.156
Ragnor's been
holed up in his secret

08:11.158 --> 08:12.757
country house just
outside of London.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.827
For all I know,
Ragnor suspected
my fire message

08:15.829 --> 08:18.597
was a ploy by Valentine
to lure him out of hiding.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.665
We'll have to
confront him
face-to-face.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.867
You're going
on this mission?

08:21.869 --> 08:22.968
[Magnus] Of course!

08:22.970 --> 08:24.803
I'm the only one
Ragnor trusts.

08:24.805 --> 08:28.907
Besides, I've played
my last hand here.
Even I know when to fold.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.478
Magnus, I didn't know
you were here.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.447
That was the point.

08:35.449 --> 08:36.681
[Lydia] We're just
on our way to greet

08:36.683 --> 08:38.283
a few representatives
of the Clave

08:38.285 --> 08:40.619
who arrived early
for tomorrow's wedding.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.887
How long are you staying?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.289
What's going on here?
Nobody told me
about a meeting.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.024
Magnus figured out
that Ragnor Fell

08:46.026 --> 08:47.292
is the warlock
who can wake my mom.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.127
We're just bringing him
back to the Institute.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.629
How can I help?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.964
We're just recovering
a warlock, Alec.
We got this covered.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.468
Besides, you have emissaries
from the Clave to meet.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.869
You don't want to
tarnish your family's

08:57.871 --> 09:00.205
perfectly-crafted
image now, do you?

09:03.143 --> 09:06.177
[inhales sharply] Again,
lovely seeing you, Magnus.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.279
[chuckles softly]

09:11.151 --> 09:12.217
[Jace sighs]

09:12.986 --> 09:15.220
Get ready.
We leave in an hour.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.993
Jace. Jace, slow down.
We need to talk about this.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.863
Talk about what?
We're good, okay?

09:24.865 --> 09:28.667
No, we're not.
At least... I'm not.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.769
We need to talk
about what Valentine
said about us.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.103
Look, I don't want
to talk about it.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.506
It happened.
I feel weird right now.

09:34.508 --> 09:37.776
I get it. I feel
the same way, okay?
But... [inhales deeply]

09:37.778 --> 09:40.045
Look, we didn't
know, all right?
It's not our fault.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.447
[sighs] I can't
do this right now.
I'm sorry.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.920
Now that the Clave
has control
of the Mortal Cup,

09:48.922 --> 09:51.423
thanks to your
lovely bride to be,

09:51.425 --> 09:54.192
Mom and Dad
can come home now.
They arrive tonight.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.395
I heard.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.597
Max is staying with
his tutors in Idris.
It's safer there.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.432
Now with all the
dignitaries arriving
for the wedding,

10:00.434 --> 10:02.267
Mom must be
beside herself.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.272
This wedding is becoming
more of a headache
than I had planned.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.075
Alec, you don't have to
go through with this
if you don't want to.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.543
It's what I want.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.545
Okay.
Okay?

10:13.547 --> 10:15.146
No big argument
from you?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.881
You stood by me
through my trial,

10:16.883 --> 10:19.017
and now I'm standing
by you, big brother.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.688
And... I'm throwing
you a bachelor party.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.958
A what?
A bachelor party.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.727
I don't need
a bachelor party.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.897
No one needs a bachelor party,
but I'm throwing
you one anyways.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.899
Actually, Jace should be
the one throwing it,

10:34.901 --> 10:38.336
but considering everything
he must be going
through with Clary...

10:38.338 --> 10:41.072
I don't wanna ask
him to do anything.
You know what I mean?

10:41.074 --> 10:44.442
I do. Sisters can really
drive you nuts sometimes.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.677
[sighs]

10:47.581 --> 10:49.748
Ragnor's house
is just across
these fields.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.250
Let's make this quick.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.751
We'll talk to Ragnor,
then Portal him
back to the Institute

10:52.753 --> 10:54.386
before anyone
knows we're gone.

10:55.589 --> 10:58.590
So... brother
and sister, huh?

10:58.592 --> 10:59.924
I don't wanna
talk about it.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.826
What, so we're
just gonna be
work buddies now?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.361
All about the mission,
and totally ignore

11:03.363 --> 11:04.863
the huge bomb that
just dropped on us.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.098
Yeah, sounds like a plan.
[sighs]

11:07.100 --> 11:08.266
What do you want
me to say, Clary?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.434
That I was attracted
to my sister?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.186
No--
Point of fact,

11:11.187 --> 11:12.937
brother and sisters
are often attracted
to each other.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.639
I once knew
this one couple
in ancient Egypt--

11:16.810 --> 11:18.210
Magnus, not helping.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.611
Maybe this will all
make sense when
we wake up Jocelyn.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.012
Since she is Jace's mother
as well, perhaps--

11:21.014 --> 11:22.147
Don't say
that again.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.515
Maryse is my mother.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.616
[Clary sighs]

11:24.618 --> 11:26.351
At best, Jocelyn
is the woman
who abandoned me.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.786
[Clary] Hey,
that is not true.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.954
My mother would
never abandon her son.
She thought you were dead.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.156
Or maybe she
just didn't want me.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.724
You don't know her, Jace.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.893
That's right, Clary,
I don't. Do you?

11:34.895 --> 11:37.395
I'm sorry I asked!
I came with you

11:37.397 --> 11:39.130
to escape my
relationship drama,

11:39.132 --> 11:41.566
not get a front
row seat to yours.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.704
What was that?
Nice try, Jace.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.640
You're not getting out
of this conversation
that easily.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.075
Look out!

11:51.078 --> 11:52.477
[Clary gasping]

11:57.584 --> 11:59.617
Ragnor put up wards
to protect his lair.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.387
Why is the fire green?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.155
It's a wall of fire
that only the pure

12:04.157 --> 12:06.324
of heart and intention
can pass through.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.160
Are you ready?

12:22.175 --> 12:23.641
Jace?
[whooshing]

12:24.544 --> 12:25.677
Magnus?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.179
Where are you?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.748
[breathing heavily]

12:30.617 --> 12:32.117
[energy pulsating]

12:38.592 --> 12:39.791
Ragnor Fell.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.535
Ragnor? Ragnor?

12:57.811 --> 12:59.277
Hello?

13:06.586 --> 13:08.787
Is anybody home?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.355
I need your help.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.560
Ragnor, I know you're here.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.097
I just need to
find my friends.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.498
[clicking]

13:31.978 --> 13:33.745
Nice try, Ragnor.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.582
[grunts]

13:37.584 --> 13:40.919
Well done...
Clary Fairchild.

13:40.921 --> 13:44.255
I've been expecting you.
You have Jocelyn's
talent, I see.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.458
Only a true artist
would notice the subtle
changes in my eyes.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.611
Yes, I know.

13:49.612 --> 13:51.763
I need to work on
not moving my eyes,
you don't need to remind me.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.631
You knew my mom?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.600
So you made the potion
that put her to sleep?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.168
At her request, yes.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.636
And I knew it was
only a matter of time

13:58.638 --> 14:00.672
before you came to me
looking for the antidote.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.340
Please, sit.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.310
My friends, Jace Wayland
and Magnus Bane.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.645
They were with me,
but I lost them
in the fire.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.548
Let me do this my way!
Your friends,
are they true?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.518
Magnus said he's
known you for centuries.
He sent you a fire message.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.321
This is not an act.
It is not an act!
It is essential.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.522
Okay, what is your deal?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.290
My friends are missing
and if you can't help me,

14:19.292 --> 14:20.792
I'll find someone
who can.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.227
What is it worth to you?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.729
You find my friends
and wake my mother...

14:26.066 --> 14:29.500
I'll give you anything.
That's what
I wanted to hear.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.735
[fingers snapping]

14:30.737 --> 14:31.970
[gasps]

14:31.972 --> 14:33.137
[Magnus sighs]

14:33.139 --> 14:36.074
Honestly, Ragnor,
was that nonsense
necessary?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.508
Of course.
She offered me
anything.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.911
You were only
up to a timeshare
of your flat in Paris.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.212
Yawn.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.580
All right, enough
with the warlock games.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.982
Can you really
wake my mother?

14:43.984 --> 14:45.483
Not without
the <i> Book of the White.</i>

14:45.485 --> 14:46.818
What is the
<i> Book of the White?</i>

14:46.820 --> 14:48.319
[Magnus] It's an ancient book
of warlock magic

14:48.321 --> 14:50.722
containing spells
more powerful than...
[chuckles]

14:50.724 --> 14:52.323
most warlocks
could ever imagine.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.993
I possessed the book when
your mother came to me,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.861
and I used its contents
to create the potion.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.830
Regrettably,
I no longer have the book.

14:58.832 --> 15:01.332
I asked Jocelyn to hide it
that Valentine
might never find it.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.167
Ragnor, please,
I have to get my mom back.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.069
Is there any way to get
the <i> Book of the White?</i>

15:05.071 --> 15:07.205
Possibly. I may
have something
that can help us.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.407
Won't be but a moment.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.175
What do we do
if he can't find the book?

15:11.177 --> 15:12.577
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.945
It's a bit drab,
isn't it?

15:13.947 --> 15:16.347
[demon roaring]
[Ragnor screams]

15:19.252 --> 15:20.518
[gasps] Ragnor!

15:20.520 --> 15:21.653
Shax demon.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.290
[Ragnor gasping]

15:25.292 --> 15:27.292
Creature took me...
by surprise.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.460
How could a Shax demon
get past Ragnor's wards?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.929
It must have
followed us.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.563
Jumped through when
the fire wall reset.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.732
Be still, my little
dear cabbage.
[gasping]

15:34.734 --> 15:36.567
Your wounds are deep.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.703
Hold on, please.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.038
[gasping]

15:41.608 --> 15:43.574
[softly] No, no, no.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.543
[Jace sighs]

15:48.448 --> 15:52.550
For centuries, this man
knew me better than anyone.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.386
Magnus, I'm so sorry.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.221
We have to leave, now.

15:57.223 --> 16:00.124
We can't. Not until we find
whatever it is Ragnor said

16:00.126 --> 16:01.592
could help us locate
the <i> Book of the White.</i>

16:01.594 --> 16:03.494
It's too dangerous.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.395
If one Shax demon found us,
you can bet there
are more on the way.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.731
We have to try!

16:06.733 --> 16:10.134
We don't have time
to scour through mountains
of Ragnor's stuff.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.403
[inhales deeply]
[fingers snapping]

16:12.405 --> 16:13.972
[energy pulsating]

16:13.974 --> 16:16.308
Get back to the Institute.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.643
I'll transport everything
back to my place,
and find what you need.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.413
Now, leave me to
take care of my friend.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.320
[Clary] Magnus, I am--
Go!

16:38.598 --> 16:39.864
[sighs]

16:43.603 --> 16:45.770
Jace, you're coming
to Alec's
bachelor party, right?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.639
No. He doesn't
want me there,
and I'm swamped.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.274
You two seriously
haven't worked
things out yet?

16:50.276 --> 16:52.610
There's nothing
to work out. If he wants
to talk, we'll talk.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.212
He's your <i> parabatai.</i>

16:56.983 --> 16:59.951
We have more
important things going on
than a bachelor party.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.519
Come with me.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.161
We have a mole
in the Institute.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.796
We were attacked
by a Shax demon

17:11.798 --> 17:13.231
when we went to
see Ragnor Fell.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.166
The attack couldn't
have been coincidence.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.335
Valentine must have
been tracking us.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.669
You don't think someone
from the Institute

17:18.671 --> 17:20.138
told Valentine
where you were going.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.339
There's no other explanation.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.975
No one here would
betray us like that.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.410
This is our family.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.316
Magnus figured out
that Ragnor Fell

17:32.318 --> 17:33.818
is the warlock
who can wake my mom.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.887
We're bringing him
back to the Institute.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.223
Not everyone's family yet.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.561
I swear, if Lydia
is the leak, I'm gonna--

17:43.563 --> 17:45.396
Slow down.
We don't know if
she did anything yet.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.999
And wrongfully
accusing someone
of a crime is dangerous.

17:48.001 --> 17:49.901
Trust me,
I've been through it.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.737
Lydia was right there
when we were
talking about Ragnor Fell.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.506
If she's not gonna
admit what she did,
I'm gonna make her admit it.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.342
Jace, stop.
You are too worked up
to talk to anyone right now.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.878
Especially not
an important envoy
from the Clave.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.681
Let me talk to Lydia.
If you accuse Alec's
fiancee of treason,

18:03.683 --> 18:06.417
you will ruin
whatever relationship
you have left with him.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.586
Clary's right, Jace.
If Lydia did this,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.455
she might not be
so defensive with Clary.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.356
She might let
her guard down.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.858
Slip up.
Fine.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.427
But I wanna know
everything she says.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.734
It's perfect.
I love it.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.304
I'm so glad.
Let me know if you
need anything else.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.410
Your dress is stunning.
Thank you.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.545
I feel more nervous
wearing that dress

18:34.547 --> 18:36.547
than I ever have
on the battlefield.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.516
I think that's
pretty normal.

18:39.752 --> 18:43.721
[inhales] Lydia, I need
to talk to you
about something.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.389
What is it?

18:45.391 --> 18:47.892
Valentine sent
a Shax demon to track us
on our mission today.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.261
It killed Ragnor Fell.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.496
By the Angel...

18:51.498 --> 18:54.065
Only a few people
here at the Institute

18:54.067 --> 18:55.633
even knew we were
going on the mission.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.238
You overheard us
this morning.
Then we were attacked.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.406
If I was working
for Valentine,

19:02.408 --> 19:05.543
don't you think I would have
already given
him the Mortal Cup?

19:07.113 --> 19:08.513
I don't believe this.

19:08.515 --> 19:12.083
Fellow Shadowhunters
accusing me of high treason.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.252
Lydia, I'm not
accusing you of anything.
Of course you are.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.954
Unless you have
hard evidence
to back your claims,

19:16.956 --> 19:18.623
I believe this
conversation is over.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.957
Fine, but know this.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.161
These people have
become like family to me...

19:23.963 --> 19:25.930
and I protect my family.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.265
I care about them too.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.267
Why else would I
be marrying Alec?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.335
How well do you
actually know him?

19:31.337 --> 19:34.338
You're talking
about Alec's feelings
for Magnus? I'm not blind.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.107
If... if you're not
in love with Alec,

19:36.109 --> 19:37.608
then why are you
going through
with this marriage?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.844
Alec's love for his family

19:39.846 --> 19:42.113
and his desire to restore
the Lightwood name

19:42.115 --> 19:45.983
has touched me in ways
that I haven't felt
in a very long time.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.620
Alec is a man of honor...
and I truly care about him.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.556
But what about
Alec's happiness?

19:51.558 --> 19:54.458
Shadowhunters know that
our duty to our family

19:54.460 --> 19:56.394
supersedes our
personal desires.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.330
Look, I know that you're
still new to this world

19:59.332 --> 20:01.732
and our traditions
may seem foreign
to you, but I--

20:01.734 --> 20:03.234
Yeah, more like
ice cold.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.303
Alec should not have
to give up who he is,

20:05.305 --> 20:08.573
or at least the chance
to figure it out,
just to please his family.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.974
But Alec proposed to me.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.709
This is what he wants.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.078
[sighs]

20:19.919 --> 20:21.085
How do I trust you?

20:21.087 --> 20:23.221
You're Valentine's daughter...

20:24.157 --> 20:25.556
and I learned to trust you.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.276
Nice. Trim fit.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.578
It'll make it look
like you work out.
Isabelle.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.680
[stammers] Is...
is Clary okay?

20:49.682 --> 20:53.050
She's fine. [sighs]
I just need your
advice on something.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.619
First time for
everything, huh?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.521
You can go now, Stan.
What's up?

20:58.091 --> 20:59.957
It's about Alec's
bachelor party.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.760
When you were a mundane,
you went to one, right?

21:02.762 --> 21:06.430
Well, I'm only 18,
and I'm a vampire now, so...

21:07.467 --> 21:09.934
But... I know
a thing or two.
[chuckles]

21:09.936 --> 21:11.035
Simon...

21:11.037 --> 21:16.040
what makes
a bachelor party...
a bachelor party?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.908
Well, there is a certain
bridge and tunnel crowd

21:17.910 --> 21:20.611
that would say the answer
to that is strippers.
[chuckles]

21:23.216 --> 21:25.950
But, you know,
there's no one right way
to throw a bachelor party.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.019
It... depends
on who's there.

21:29.989 --> 21:34.125
Like... they're really about
best friends coming together

21:34.127 --> 21:37.728
and assuring each other
that they're always
gonna be best friends.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.563
Even if one of
them gets married.

21:39.565 --> 21:42.133
So it's about
solidifying the bonds

21:42.135 --> 21:43.901
with the people that
are closest to you?

21:43.903 --> 21:45.403
That, and a ton
of drinking.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.238
[chuckles] You
have both of those,

21:47.240 --> 21:49.540
and your bachelor party
will be a success.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.909
[sighs]

22:00.186 --> 22:02.653
[clicks tongue] How I
loathe that photograph.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.588
I must remember,
chin down, eyes up.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.824
Otherwise, I look like
a squinty toad.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.027
You're here.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.961
You didn't think
you'd be rid of me
that easily, did you?

22:11.964 --> 22:16.267
[chuckling] Oh,
my dear friend, I will
always be here for you.

22:16.269 --> 22:19.036
Now, please,
put away that
horrid photograph.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.005
It commemorates a night
I'd rather forget.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.207
[chuckles] Oh,
how I had to comfort you.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.609
How I loved her.

22:25.611 --> 22:29.013
I prayed she would
love me the same,
but she just laughed.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.383
To Camille, immortals
aren't supposed
to feel true love.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.751
She was so cynical.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.021
Camille broke my heart.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.956
You let her break
your heart, my friend.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.260
You're immortal...
but she killed you.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.438
[beeps]

22:54.907 --> 22:56.240
[inhales deeply]

22:57.310 --> 22:58.709
[cell phone beeps]

23:00.580 --> 23:01.879

23:02.648 --> 23:04.315
Only a couple more steps.

23:04.317 --> 23:06.550
[dance music playing]

23:07.987 --> 23:09.253
We're almost there!

23:09.255 --> 23:10.588
All right,
Izzy... [sighs]

23:10.590 --> 23:12.390
You trust me, don't you?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.258
[scoffs]
No, not really.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.993
And I told you,
I don't need
a bachelor party.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.661
[sighs]
You need this one.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.729
[sighs]

23:18.731 --> 23:22.233
Now, count to five,
and take your blindfold off.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.901
Really, Izzy?

23:29.342 --> 23:30.508
Seriously?

23:36.349 --> 23:37.748
Izzy said you
wanted to talk.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.018
I don't know what
she thought
I wanted to say.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.387
Great. I guess I'll go.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.523
I've got work
to do anyway.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.896
[exhales] Damn it, Izzy.

23:51.898 --> 23:54.465
[sighs] You know what?
She's right.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.467
We do need to talk.

23:56.469 --> 24:00.805
Okay. Well, it's my
bachelor party,
so you go first.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.609
I don't know how things got
so messed up between us.

24:06.646 --> 24:10.047
But I do know my life
has been a lot harder
not having you to talk to.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.384
[sighs] Mine, too.

24:13.386 --> 24:16.654
I know it seems like
I've been making a lot
of crazy choices lately.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.889
And I know you
think that I was

24:18.891 --> 24:21.125
only thinking about
myself... and Clary,

24:21.127 --> 24:23.627
and I wasn't thinking
about the consequences
to anyone else.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.131
All I can say is, I've been
going through a lot.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.202
But I only ever did
what I thought
was right, Alec.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.639
But I never
wanted to hurt you.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.242
I'm sorry.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.978
[sighs] I know.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.850
You know, we just...
got caught
in all this drama.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.118
Yeah. [scoffs]

24:48.120 --> 24:50.521
I mean... you're
getting married tomorrow.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.657
And Clary's your sister.
You know,
what's up with that?

24:53.659 --> 24:57.027
Hell. Yeah, uh,
don't even get me
started on that.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.230
[sighs]

25:03.035 --> 25:04.935
I kissed her.
Mmm.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.770
It's worse, I wanted her.

25:06.772 --> 25:07.838
[gulps]

25:08.441 --> 25:10.007
I was falling in love.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.612
I must be sick
or something.
I don't know.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.679
No.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.350
Nah.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.354
You're not sick.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.690
Situation's just...

25:26.692 --> 25:28.025
It's confusing.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.363
And trust me, I know.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.131
You know, it's like,

25:34.133 --> 25:36.567
you have this
plan for your life...

25:36.569 --> 25:38.636
right, and you know
what you need to do

25:38.638 --> 25:40.804
and what your
responsibilities are.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.306
And you think, you know,

25:42.308 --> 25:44.742
"If you follow the rules,
everything's gonna be fine."

25:44.744 --> 25:47.211
Then somebody
comes along, and...

25:47.213 --> 25:49.580
[inhales] pushes
you off that path.

25:49.582 --> 25:50.981
You just...

25:50.983 --> 25:53.984
Hey... I get it.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.991
The point is,
we're Shadowhunters.
Emotions get in the way.

26:00.993 --> 26:04.995
And if you get
knocked off the path,
you have to focus...

26:04.997 --> 26:06.330
and find your way back.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.933
I mean, you still have
to be true to yourself.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.100
I am.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.604

Look, would you be my <i> suggenes</i>
and give me away tomorrow?

26:28.454 --> 26:31.422
Alec, if this is
what you really want...

26:32.858 --> 26:34.124
I'd be honored.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.859
[sighs]

26:35.861 --> 26:37.361
I'm always gonna
be here for you.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.929
Me, too.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.614
[playing out of tune]

26:56.616 --> 26:59.216
I wouldn't describe that
as an instrument of music.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.584
An instrument
of torture, perhaps.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.753
Oh, you never
liked the charango.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.054
No, I did not.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.123
And I pray
you don't play it.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.492
Death has already given me
enough of a headache.

27:08.494 --> 27:09.727
Do you remember Imasu?

27:09.729 --> 27:11.895
He played this
so beautifully.

27:11.897 --> 27:14.231
I'm surprised that lasted
as long as it did.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.834
He was always so much
better looking than you.

27:16.836 --> 27:20.738
[chuckles] I don't
understand why you didn't
go after the boy.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.674
I'm certain,
with very little effort,
you could have won him back.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.644
No. Imasu wanted
more than I can give.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.316
Maybe Camille was right.
I am immortal.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.785
I can party and have fun
to my heart's content

27:34.787 --> 27:37.121

of love around my feet.

You are not Camille.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.357
And though I know
you won't believe me,

27:40.359 --> 27:42.126
someday someone
will come along

27:42.128 --> 27:45.195
who will tear down
those walls you've built
around your heart.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.698
And when that love
comes back to you,

27:47.700 --> 27:51.502
you must do everything
in your power to fight for it.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.713
Going somewhere?

28:04.350 --> 28:07.885

33:39.518 --> 33:41.385
[Alec inhales deeply]

33:42.354 --> 33:44.287
You never cease
to amaze me, Alec.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.023
Yeah... [exhales]

33:46.025 --> 33:47.858
What did I just do?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.540
Alec, I am so proud of you.

34:05.744 --> 34:08.178
Guys, that was incredible.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.746
It was like watching
the live version
of <i> The Graduate.</i>

34:09.748 --> 34:12.816
You know,
the Dustin Hoffman movie?
The amazing one?

34:12.818 --> 34:15.685
You were Ben.
[mimics Ben] Elaine!
And you were Elaine.

34:15.687 --> 34:19.056
I mean, a...
a taller, masculine,
handsome version of her.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.324
But at the altar, though,
you were like...

34:21.326 --> 34:22.426
[mimics Elaine] Ben!

34:22.428 --> 34:24.728
[normal voice] And then...
and then now, you're both

34:24.730 --> 34:26.563
sitting on the bus
at the end of the movie,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.498
both totally stoked,
but wondering, like...

34:28.500 --> 34:31.168
[inhales deeply]
"What're we gonna do now?"

34:31.170 --> 34:32.402
You know? [chuckles]

34:32.404 --> 34:34.504
Who invited the vampire?

34:34.506 --> 34:35.906
Seriously?

34:39.344 --> 34:40.777
[Jace] Hey.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.913
What you just
did for Alec...

34:42.915 --> 34:45.082
I, um--
It was the
right thing to do.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.917
So what are you
gonna do now?

34:48.253 --> 34:51.755
Head back to Idris.
[sighs] Dive into work.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.591
There's no place
for me here.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.760
There's always gonna be
a place for you here.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.133
Give Alec
and Magnus my best.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.110
[Jace sighs]

35:14.413 --> 35:15.645
Is Lydia gonna be okay?

35:16.115 --> 35:17.347
She'll be all right.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.754
[Clary sighs]
Look, Clary...

35:24.756 --> 35:28.125
Listen, I just
need to say that...
you were right.

35:29.761 --> 35:33.163
Seeing what Alec just did,
I realized I
can't shut you out.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.800
I just don't know
what to do with all this.

35:38.070 --> 35:41.671
Much as this will shock Alec,
my visit tonight
wasn't all for him.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.975
We need to speak privately.

35:53.452 --> 35:56.920
I pulled every item
of magical importance
from Ragnor's belongings.

35:56.922 --> 36:00.590
But I can't determine
which will lead
to the <i> Book of the White.</i>

36:00.592 --> 36:01.758
Wait, this bookmark.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.594
I've seen it before.
In the alternate dimension

36:04.596 --> 36:06.496
you showed me
a book of spells,
and this was in it.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.931
It must have been
the <i> Book of the White.</i>

36:07.933 --> 36:09.750
[Alec] If that's the case,

36:09.751 --> 36:11.568
we can use the bookmark
to track
the owner of the book.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.436
Okay.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.338
Warlock tracking
is stronger.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.842
[breathing deeply]

36:22.848 --> 36:26.616
[Camille screaming]
Let me out of here!

36:26.618 --> 36:27.684
[gasps]

36:29.288 --> 36:32.122
Well, there's good
news and bad news.

36:32.124 --> 36:35.158
The good news is
I know the owner.
The bad?

36:35.160 --> 36:37.294
It's Camille.
Camille?

36:37.296 --> 36:39.129
Looks like Raphael
has her locked up

36:39.131 --> 36:40.330
in the basement of
the Hotel DuMort.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.465
Well, after I punched her,
there's no way she'll help me.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.867
She won't have a choice.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.369
Trust me.

37:09.161 --> 37:10.460
[screams]

37:11.330 --> 37:12.462
[grunts]

37:14.199 --> 37:15.498
[groaning]

37:15.500 --> 37:16.633
[footsteps approaching]

37:18.670 --> 37:20.303
[straining]

37:27.512 --> 37:29.079
Why'd you ask me
up here, Clary?

37:30.115 --> 37:31.748
I needed you to see this.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.785
What is all that?

37:35.787 --> 37:38.688
Luke told me that
my mother had a son.

37:56.208 --> 37:57.874
[sighs]

37:57.876 --> 37:59.209
Jonathan Christopher.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.145
What's that?
It's my name.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.049
"JC."

38:06.051 --> 38:07.384
Jace.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.086
Short for
Jonathan Christopher.

38:10.088 --> 38:14.391
Jace, I know all of this
is impossible to believe,
but...

38:15.327 --> 38:17.527
our mother
never abandoned you.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.730
She thought
you were dead.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.800
This is all she
had left, and she...

38:23.802 --> 38:26.336
she carried you with
her every single day.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.405
Is all this really mine?

38:35.247 --> 38:36.913
[sighs]

38:36.915 --> 38:38.882
I don't know
who I am anymore.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.352
There's darkness in me.

38:43.622 --> 38:47.324
It's always been there.
And now I...

38:47.926 --> 38:49.192
[sighs]

38:50.295 --> 38:55.498
When we rescued Jocelyn...
and I let Valentine go...

38:57.302 --> 38:59.803
I was tempted
to go with him.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.805
He's my father.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.106
Maybe that's where I belong.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.207
Jace...

39:04.209 --> 39:05.909
I know you're a good man.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.880
I don't know how,
but we are going
to make sense of all this.

39:12.284 --> 39:14.351
I promise.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.573
[exhales]

39:20.574 --> 39:22.991
I'm so glad we got
away from that crowd
and all those people.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.394
So intense.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.530
I have to hand it
to you, Alexander...

39:27.532 --> 39:29.299
you certainly know
how to make a statement.

39:29.301 --> 39:30.700
[footsteps approaching]

39:36.141 --> 39:38.208
What have you done, Alec?

39:38.710 --> 39:39.976
To us, this family?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.144
This isn't about you.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.981
Of course it is.
You are either
being selfish or naive.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.983
This wedding was your
plan from the start.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.885
And now you have
humiliated us in front of

39:48.887 --> 39:50.387
the most respected
members of the Clave.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.889
I don't even
recognize you anymore.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.658
I'm the same person
I've always been.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.627
Now everything's
just out in the open.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.898
And all for a Downworlder.

40:06.204 --> 40:07.437
Just give her time.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.007
[Alec inhales deeply]

40:11.009 --> 40:12.575
And you?

40:14.179 --> 40:15.779
I don't really
understand this.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.181
But I suppose our
world is changing.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.218
How long has this
been going on?

40:22.220 --> 40:24.454
Are you two in love?

40:24.456 --> 40:26.956
[scoffs]
Love? What? No.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.526
No, it's... it's, uh,
it's sort of a different...
It's not--

40:29.528 --> 40:31.528
It's all very new.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.762
[Alec] Right.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.098
Right.

40:36.368 --> 40:38.101
[sighs]

40:41.139 --> 40:43.006
I better go check on Mom.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.308
[sighs]

40:47.579 --> 40:49.746
You know what
I just realized?

40:49.748 --> 40:51.848
We still haven't
gone on our date yet.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.785
[scoffs]
Yeah, you're right.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.220
[sniffs]

40:57.222 --> 41:01.858
You wanna...
I don't know,
get a drink sometime?

41:03.428 --> 41:04.894
I would love that.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.297
Great.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.066
Looks like we missed
the wedding of the year.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.168
It's all right.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.306
You and I will be able to
share our love openly one day.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.247
How is she?
She's asleep...

41:24.249 --> 41:25.582
but she's home.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.352
You okay, Hodge?

41:29.354 --> 41:30.520
Yeah.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.821
You should get some rest.

41:32.324 --> 41:33.690
You've been so vigilant.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.425
Why don't you let
me watch over her.

41:35.427 --> 41:37.327
Thank you, my friend.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.397
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.485
You have the Cup.

42:05.724 --> 42:10.126
Help me break my
Punishment rune...
and I will bring it to you.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.969
A deal is a deal.
