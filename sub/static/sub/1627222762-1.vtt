00:32.116 --> 00:34.035
<i>Salty and sweet.</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:36.996
<i>That was my mother.</i>

00:41.209 --> 00:44.170
<i>Always did have a flavor for danger.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:58.559
<i>Pickled in her wine,
She so desperately tried.</i>

01:11.864 --> 01:15.076
<i>Oh, but she couldn't
take care of me, mm-mm.</i>

01:15.159 --> 01:17.203
<i>Not like you did, anyway.</i>

01:19.914 --> 01:22.959
<i>Lord, I know you
put me here for a reason,</i>

01:23.042 --> 01:26.379
<i>and Lord knows I've tried to forget it.</i>

01:28.506 --> 01:32.218
<i>But through all these
choppy waters, I thank you,</i>

01:32.301 --> 01:36.305
<i>my dear Jesus, for keeping
this humble heart beating free.</i>

01:40.393 --> 01:44.188
<i>My love, my Lord, my savior.</i>

02:04.709 --> 02:08.713
I love you, I love you, I love you.
I just wanna marry you.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.507
Oh, Jesus, you're my one and only.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.968
I swear, I will always...

02:14.051 --> 02:15.636
Hey, I told you to clean the...

02:17.179 --> 02:18.806
Really?

02:20.766 --> 02:24.395
This is what you're doing
in the middle of the goddamn day? Great.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.941
Can't you just be a normal kid?

03:00.514 --> 03:05.478
<i>Normal kid?</i>
<i>Well, how'd I do?</i>

03:07.188 --> 03:10.191
<i>Yeah, not so great, I guess.</i>

03:10.274 --> 03:12.234
<i>But not Your fault so much,</i>

03:12.318 --> 03:15.988
<i>unless this was all a part
of Your silly old plan.</i>

03:42.181 --> 03:46.727
<i>Fuck me. I can't believe
you're making me do this shit.</i>

03:55.403 --> 03:56.654
Hello again.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.407
I'm Merle, sex and love addict.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.325
Hi, Merle.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.577
Well, in spite of all
the progress I've made,

04:03.661 --> 04:08.290
I... recently had
another bottom line slip.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.545
I'm really ashamed. I...

04:14.422 --> 04:17.382
I really thought this time
was gonna be different.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.552
A real relationship, you know?

04:20.719 --> 04:24.306
That lasted all of six days.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.935
Um, our final night together, he, um...

04:29.311 --> 04:33.983
bit my lip so hard it bled,
and I started to cry.

04:34.066 --> 04:38.737
Um, and then he told me
that he had a fantasy

04:38.821 --> 04:42.241
of making love to a woman
while she was crying.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.414
So mission accomplished.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.957
But...

04:50.040 --> 04:52.668
He told me that he loved me.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.671
And then after he left, he, um...

04:57.423 --> 05:00.968
blocked my number and unfollowed me.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.891
And I just feel really worthless.

05:19.862 --> 05:24.074
<i>And You said,
"I am the light of the world,</i>

05:24.158 --> 05:28.162
<i>but he who follows me
will not walk in the darkness,</i>

05:28.245 --> 05:32.041
<i>but shall have the light of love."</i>

06:26.303 --> 06:27.555
Do I know you?

06:27.638 --> 06:30.975
Uh, yeah. I'm, uh... I'm Mads, I'm here...

06:31.058 --> 06:33.519
Oh, Evie's friend from home.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.522
They do grow 'em pretty in Texas.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.775
You're late.

06:39.858 --> 06:43.696
I didn't know there was
a set schedule for this shit.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.781
Come in.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.912
Wait, so you're... you're not American?

06:51.996 --> 06:55.291
- Cause, like, on your TV show you were...
- Acting.

06:55.374 --> 06:59.378
- Oh. Ah, funny.
- Can I get you something?

06:59.461 --> 07:02.131
Uh, no, no, I'm cool as a cucumber.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.842
So you're out here
to be an actress?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.219
Uh, no, no.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.097
Ah, most people are here to be something.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.311
Escape whatever unseen invalidated life
they're running from.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.313
Are you ambitious?

07:17.396 --> 07:20.774
Ambition always seemed like
kind of a pointy word to me.

07:20.858 --> 07:26.572
Like, um, arrow or thorn,
you know, it just...

07:26.655 --> 07:30.034
I feel like it just depends
on the things you're into.

07:30.117 --> 07:36.749
Um, but I do think that I'm meant
for, um, something or somebody.

07:36.832 --> 07:40.628
A romantic. You're a rare animal.

07:40.711 --> 07:44.173
Take a word of advice
from a kindred spirit:

07:44.256 --> 07:49.219
Keep moving before you get stuck.
This place is a trap, you know.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.597
Just like those pits down by the museums.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.267
Thousands of years ago,
this whole valley was a swamp.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.978
Animals came from hundreds
of miles around.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.439
Mammoths, sabretooth cats,

08:00.522 --> 08:02.524
uh, dire wolves,

08:02.608 --> 08:06.403
all lured by the scent of sweet water.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.782
But the ground under this place
isn't solid, it's tar.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.868
Black and sticky as the devil's shit.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.663
Those animals, they got trapped in it.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.706
And their dying cries
brought out scavengers

08:17.790 --> 08:20.042
looking for an easy meal,
and they got stuck too.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.795
Thousands of years later,

08:22.878 --> 08:26.298
scientists are still pulling fossils
out of those pits.

08:26.382 --> 08:29.259
Skeletons all mixed up.

08:29.343 --> 08:33.806
Be careful, or someday someone
will be digging you up.

08:33.889 --> 08:39.019
And with so many bones, they won't
even be able to tell you apart.

08:40.645 --> 08:45.609
The trick to LA is take a sip
from the spring, spread your wings.

08:45.693 --> 08:49.822
Catch a breeze and ride on out of here
before you get stuck.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.657
Um...

08:53.200 --> 08:56.036
Why do dealers
always sound like preachers?

08:56.120 --> 08:59.540
I mean, honestly,
are you a prophet or a pusher?

08:59.623 --> 09:02.418
- Just make up your mind.
- Hm.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.878
Yeah, I don't know.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.840
Evie tells me you girls
are working the club tonight.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.760
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
I think I might, uh, come by.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.140
You can always work for me, you know.

09:17.433 --> 09:22.771
Uh, look, I just came here 'cause I got
a car and I was in the neighborhood.

09:22.855 --> 09:28.235
I'm not really looking to be your friendly
neighborhood dope peddler, but thank you.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.405
By the way, I love
your big, fat, gold LTD.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.074
'72? Don't see them around much.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.618
Um... mm-hm.

09:36.702 --> 09:42.166
I know your ride, I know your plates,
I know your friends.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.793
So what don't I know about you, Mads?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.726
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Cool.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.394
- Uh...
- Thanks for coming by.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.104
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.376
Good morning.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.506
- Little package.
- Teddy.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.804
Hey, Mads, um...

10:39.431 --> 10:43.185
Did you ever hear from that, uh,
guy you were fucking at community?

10:43.268 --> 10:45.354
What?

10:45.437 --> 10:48.482
Didn't he get a job out here or something?

10:48.565 --> 10:51.735
No idea what on earth
made you think of him.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.781
I don't know, maybe it
was, urn, all these drugs.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.953
Oh, well, well, well.

11:01.036 --> 11:05.624
You know, you really oughta
quit that dumbass job of yours.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.084
Oh, boy.

11:07.167 --> 11:12.297
Come on, like, folding $400
sweaters for ten bucks an hour.

11:12.381 --> 11:16.844
It's an insult to your post-modern
feminist sensibilities.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.345
Oh, is it?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.597
We've got to work to destabilize

11:20.681 --> 11:23.725
the patriarchal norms
entrenched into a society

11:23.809 --> 11:26.687
that has caused so much gender inequality.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.815
I love how much
you care about this.

11:30.899 --> 11:34.695
Plus, you'd make way more
selling Eric's drugs.

11:34.778 --> 11:40.075
Well, well, I also got fired last night.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.327
- Why?
- What?

11:42.411 --> 11:43.453
Mm...

11:45.622 --> 11:50.961
Because I... kinda sorta...

11:51.044 --> 11:53.255
fucked the boss's husband again!

11:53.338 --> 11:54.882
- Again?
- Again!

11:54.965 --> 11:56.842
That's awesome!

11:56.925 --> 11:59.219
I guess old habits die hard, sweetie.

11:59.303 --> 12:03.390
- They do.
- Well, then it's settled.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.893
You're working at the club with us now!

12:05.976 --> 12:07.978
- No!
- Yes!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.605
I said maybe.

12:09.688 --> 12:14.192
<i>Working at the club,
aka, selling a bunch of shit-ass drugs</i>

12:14.276 --> 12:16.820
<i>to LA's horniest crackheads.</i>

12:27.706 --> 12:30.584
Yay! She's fun again!

12:31.376 --> 12:33.587
Whoo!

12:52.189 --> 12:56.193
Oh, come on, Mads, it's gonna be fun.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.402
Told you.

13:07.663 --> 13:10.040
You know they say Marilyn's buried here.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.626
And also James Dean,
and also Whitney Houston.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.795
- Let's have a sÃ©ance.
- I can't believe this.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.134
Oh, my Lord.

13:29.351 --> 13:34.731
So, another little sister here
from Texas to help Evie out.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.858
Sort of.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.945
Only Addy's my actual blood.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.072
We grew up with Mads.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.491
She's like our honorary little sister.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.702
Well, we're all family here.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.496
- Hey, Gamor.
- Hm?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.165
- What do you think?
- Hm...

13:53.375 --> 13:55.293
Well, let me take a look.

13:55.377 --> 14:02.050
Let's see here, a little vintage jewelry,
smoky eye, pouty red lip.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.886
I like it. She's like a gothic Madonna.

14:07.014 --> 14:12.561
It's funny you say that because
Mads has like a little Jesus thing.

14:12.644 --> 14:16.273
- Ooh, Jesus.
- Yeah. Um, I'd say that she

14:16.356 --> 14:18.442
takes it to the next level, though.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.486
Mads doesn't just love Jesus,
she'd love to fuck Jesus.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.030
Hey!

14:23.113 --> 14:25.657
- It's true.
- You can't blame her,

14:25.741 --> 14:29.286
Jesus Is quite sexy.
Our first rock star.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.912
- Mm-hm.
- Definitely.

14:30.996 --> 14:36.251
<i>Well, little does she know,
I do fuck You.</i>

14:36.334 --> 14:38.670
<i>I fuck You all the time.</i>

14:38.754 --> 14:44.718
Well, Mads' outfit is preordained.
So, let's go.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.054
Doors open in 20 minutes.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.430
Tits up.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.682
Uh, Carmen, put some lip gloss on, too.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.643
You're looking a little tired.
All right, here. Drink that up.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.270
Eleven minutes, come on.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.159
<i>You're my one and only.</i>

16:02.629 --> 16:04.589
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

16:12.514 --> 16:14.516
<i>I swear, I will always...</i>

16:14.599 --> 16:16.685
<i>I swear, I will always...</i>

16:30.615 --> 16:34.870
<i>Well, there just went
200 bucks of Eric's crap.</i>

16:34.953 --> 16:38.331
<i>Oh, God, I should've listened to You.</i>

16:42.919 --> 16:44.921
<i>Why don't I listen to You?</i>

16:48.466 --> 16:53.096
<i>Mom always told me that
was never much my strong suit.</i>

16:53.180 --> 16:55.473
<i>Maybe she was right.</i>

16:55.557 --> 16:57.559
<i>Fucking bitch.</i>

16:57.642 --> 16:59.728
A tripping nun.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.691
That is so fucked.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.777
There you are.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.616
Are you okay?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.992
Your shift is done.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.790
Why don't you just get changed
and put on some makeup.

17:20.874 --> 17:26.503
We're gonna have
a little late-night disco at our place.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.217
Okay.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.201
Fuck!

19:22.203 --> 19:23.997
I'm so sorry! Oh, my God!

19:24.080 --> 19:27.042
Who was he?! Who was that guy?!

19:27.125 --> 19:28.501
Oh, my God, he's just some guy
I brought home.

19:28.585 --> 19:29.669
- I'm sorry.
- Who was he?!

19:29.753 --> 19:31.171
What the fuck just happened?

19:31.254 --> 19:34.966
- Oh, my God!
- The money is all gone!

19:35.050 --> 19:37.093
- He fucking took the money!
- I'm sorry!

19:37.177 --> 19:39.554
That stupid fucking douchebag,
he took the money!

19:39.637 --> 19:43.266
That guy with the long hair,
I think he took all the drugs!

19:43.350 --> 19:44.476
- Wait!
- What the fuck?!

19:44.559 --> 19:46.478
That guy just fucking left!

19:51.983 --> 19:54.069
Evie...

19:54.152 --> 19:56.654
- Evie, what the fuck?!
- I'm sorry.

19:56.738 --> 20:00.158
- Eight fucking grand!
- I'm so sorry.

20:00.241 --> 20:04.537
Evie, why do you
drag me into this shit?! Huh?!

20:06.164 --> 20:07.749
You're supposed
to be my older sister!

20:07.832 --> 20:09.000
- Stop yelling at her.
- Don't start.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.502
Okay, it's not helping anything.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.337
- Well, what's the plan?
- You need to call Eric.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.464
- You need to call Eric.
- Can you just do it, please?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.383
He needs to fucking know

20:16.466 --> 20:19.928
why all the money and all his
fucking drugs are gone, okay?

20:20.011 --> 20:22.347
Can you just please do it?
Because he has a crush on you.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.224
And he's not gonna yell at you,
and he always yells at me.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.393
- Oh, my God, Evie.
- I need a fucking cigarette.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.061
- You're so much better at this than me.
- Where's the lighter?

20:28.144 --> 20:30.230
- I can't do it.
- Where the fuck is the lighter?

20:30.313 --> 20:32.774
Um... Please.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.153
I'm so sorry.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.614
- Evie...
- Just fucking call Eric.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.659
- Just go and call Eric.
- I'm so sorry.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.876
What the fuck is this?

20:53.378 --> 20:54.838
I don't...

20:54.921 --> 20:57.549
<i>What do you mean gone?</i>

20:57.632 --> 21:00.760
- It's gone. Stolen?
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

21:00.844 --> 21:03.179
No, no, no.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.016
I trusted you guys
to fulfill basic services.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.061
<i>This is fucking unprofessional.</i>

21:10.145 --> 21:13.440
Yeah, well, I mean, we fucked up.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.608
<i>Well, you better un-fuck it up.</i>

21:15.692 --> 21:19.487
<i>This is not some random shit I got off
of one of my usual guys.</i>

21:19.571 --> 21:21.531
This is a scary fucking drug dealer

21:21.614 --> 21:23.158
that I'm trying to make
a good impression with.

21:23.241 --> 21:26.161
And spoiler alert,
this is not impressive!

21:26.244 --> 21:28.580
You know what? How about you just

21:28.663 --> 21:31.249
stop being such a little bitch
and nut up, okay?

21:31.332 --> 21:36.212
<i>It wasn't a kilo, it was 20 grand tops.
We'll figure it out.</i>

21:36.296 --> 21:38.298
What's this fucking guy's name?

21:38.381 --> 21:42.427
Her name! Queenie,
and she does not fuck around!

21:56.733 --> 21:58.485
Get out!

22:04.866 --> 22:08.244
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

22:08.328 --> 22:11.122
<i>So either find who stole that shit</i>

22:11.206 --> 22:15.585
or find a way to get me
that 20 grand back! Fuck!

22:18.713 --> 22:20.298
Fuck you too, then.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.639
Fuck!

22:29.474 --> 22:31.643
Guys, he's really fucking freaking out.

22:31.726 --> 22:34.145
- We're being fucking evicted!
- No.

22:34.229 --> 22:36.606
- What?
- We're being evicted!

22:44.948 --> 22:46.741
You know,
this is why I left.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.536
This is why I left and went to London,

22:49.619 --> 22:52.247
because I didn't want
to be fucking poor in America!

22:52.330 --> 22:54.165
Okay.

22:54.249 --> 22:57.293
And I don't wanna be around a sister
who's a fucking crack addict.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.088
Okay, it's a coke addict,
not a crack addict.

23:00.171 --> 23:03.258
Such a fucking bitch all the time.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.301
- Fuck you. Fuck you.
- I'm so tired of it.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.345
Seriously, this could've
happened to anybody.

23:07.428 --> 23:11.432
- We all had a party.
- Fuck! Fuck!

23:13.351 --> 23:14.727
Fucking hair!

23:26.990 --> 23:29.742
Fucking dollar bill, please. Oh, God.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.386
<i>Fucking poor in America?</i>

23:48.469 --> 23:50.888
<i>Who wants to be poor anywhere?</i>

23:50.972 --> 23:55.143
<i>The world's one big shit show
and I'm right in the middle of it.</i>

23:55.226 --> 23:58.479
<i>Fuck them! Seriously, I'm not poor.</i>

23:59.606 --> 24:01.190
<i>I have You.</i>

24:01.274 --> 24:04.027
<i>They can all suck my Jesus dick.</i>

24:07.822 --> 24:09.324
<i>Cocksuckers.</i>

24:12.619 --> 24:15.955
<i>Don't look at me like that.
Where do you think I'm driving?</i>

24:16.039 --> 24:18.291
<i>I'm trying to look
for a place to live, fuck.</i>

24:25.506 --> 24:29.218
<i>Okay, well, I fucking tried
to get a roof over our heads,</i>

24:29.302 --> 24:31.888
<i>and this bitch, she don't get it.</i>

24:31.971 --> 24:34.682
<i>You know what? Fuck her
and her piece of shit house,</i>

24:34.766 --> 24:38.394
<i>and the horse she rode in on.
She probably fucked him too.</i>

24:41.105 --> 24:42.690
Fuck!

25:14.972 --> 25:16.891
What's up, sexy man?

25:27.610 --> 25:30.571
You know, I made a lot of bad decisions.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.033
Some shit You seriously don't...

25:35.535 --> 25:37.078
agree with.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.125
I don't blame You.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.463
But, You see,
I've been trying to be better.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.715
Right, I mean...

25:50.216 --> 25:52.510
I definitely be fucking way less.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.971
Kinda.

25:59.684 --> 26:01.477
Anyway, right now...

26:04.439 --> 26:06.691
Right now,
I need Your help more than ever.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.947
I need You to walk me down
Your righteous ways.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.950
I need You to show me
that light because...

26:20.663 --> 26:23.332
I really just don't wanna
hurt no more people.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.427
Show me a sign.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.722
Show me a sign.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.478
Show me a sign.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.953
You're a fucking badass.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.583
Whoo! I love You, JC!

27:05.666 --> 27:07.418
I fucking love You!

27:09.962 --> 27:10.880
Whoo!

27:19.138 --> 27:23.059
- Please tell me you found it.
- No, I told you, it's gone.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.395
Shit! You guys have forced me
to do something I don't want to do.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.855
I do not want to give you girls up.

27:27.939 --> 27:29.732
But that Queenie plays rough.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.984
You think I'm a fucking idiot

27:32.068 --> 27:34.612
just 'cause I have an innie?
You're the big dog,

27:34.695 --> 27:37.865
okay, not some low-level, street pawn.

27:37.949 --> 27:43.621
No matter how bad we might fuck up,
that money is ultimately on you, bud.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.873
I can make you get that money back.

27:46.958 --> 27:48.543
Why are you fronting on me right now?

27:48.626 --> 27:50.753
You're no pimp, you're no Killer.

27:50.837 --> 27:54.799
You're just a has-been TV actor with
a gambling addiction and a coke habit.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.553
And... and my sense tells me

27:58.636 --> 28:03.349
that clearly you're broke as fuck,
and you're in some real type of trouble

28:03.432 --> 28:07.353
because nobody runs a business
like that with no security.

28:07.436 --> 28:11.482
I mean, that is just
desperation behavior.

28:11.566 --> 28:14.986
Uh-huh, out of control.
And that shit ends bad.

28:15.069 --> 28:20.491
So, like I said, I don't have a problem.

28:20.575 --> 28:21.909
You do.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.748
Why are you even here?

28:33.129 --> 28:34.922
Where the fuck is your bedroom?

29:01.490 --> 29:03.784
<i>You're so awesome.</i>

29:06.329 --> 29:10.374
<i>Oh, I can't even stand
to breathe when I think of You.</i>

29:11.918 --> 29:15.838
<i>I will always be your girl, Jesus.</i>

29:23.679 --> 29:25.431
<i>I wasn't expecting that from you.</i>

29:28.476 --> 29:31.687
Yep, I'm full of surprises.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.942
I gotta go pee.

29:42.365 --> 29:43.407
Mads?

29:45.493 --> 29:47.954
Babe?

29:48.037 --> 29:49.413
Oh, fuck!

29:50.581 --> 29:52.750
You're crazy. This is never gonna work.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.460
Of course it'll work.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.462
You ever heard of
"Jesus take the wheel"?

29:56.545 --> 30:00.174
Well, in our case,
Jesus has taken us by the hips

30:00.257 --> 30:02.802
with his manly,
calloused carpenter hands

30:02.885 --> 30:06.681
and he is riding us all the way
back home to Kingdom Come.

30:06.764 --> 30:10.184
I'm telling you,
Jesus will not steer us wrong.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.813
Uh, I'm an atheist.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.234
Well, not anymore you're not.

30:21.112 --> 30:25.157
Okay, so we're just supposed
to tell people we came to Hollywood

30:25.241 --> 30:27.326
to start a convent?

30:27.410 --> 30:30.705
Only if they ask. Just keep it simple.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.542
So we'll meet back here in two hours.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.854
Sisters of the faithful.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.608
Hey. Oh, thank you. Do you know where
to get waxed around here?

31:00.943 --> 31:05.197
Oh. Wait, two bucks?

31:05.281 --> 31:07.324
That's all you're gonna give Jesus?

31:10.911 --> 31:12.705
Fuck.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.251
Lady, do you want your soul
to be damned for all eternity,

31:17.334 --> 31:19.045
tossing Lucifer's salad?

31:19.128 --> 31:21.630
You can afford more, look at you.

31:25.259 --> 31:28.179
Oh, thank you. God bless... Jesus Christ!

31:28.262 --> 31:32.058
- You all right?
- Oh, hell yeah. Uh, sorry.

31:33.184 --> 31:34.477
Bitch.

31:37.605 --> 31:43.319
We are starting
a convent here in Hollywood,

31:43.402 --> 31:46.906
and if you would like
to know more, here is my cell.

31:46.989 --> 31:50.951
Look, I wrote it right
where Jesus got hammered.

31:51.035 --> 31:54.497
- I dream of being hammered, too.
- Thank you.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.168
Hi, Sister.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.630
- I see you like books.
- I work at the library.

32:02.713 --> 32:03.839
Oh.

32:06.801 --> 32:09.762
Are you visiting Los Angeles, Sister?
I haven't seen you before.

32:09.845 --> 32:15.434
Uh, well, my little convent back home
is just bursting at the seams,

32:15.518 --> 32:19.355
so my Mother Superior
sent myself and my sisters

32:19.438 --> 32:24.235
down to, you know, look
for a new home and spread our, uh,

32:24.318 --> 32:28.072
our virginity... di-divinity.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.365
Where are you staying?

32:30.574 --> 32:34.036
Uh, well, I'm leaving that up
to the good Lord himself.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.540
- Mm-hm.
- Well, uh...

32:37.623 --> 32:38.958
I hope it's not too much of a bother,

32:39.041 --> 32:41.293
but one of our board members
at our library,

32:41.377 --> 32:44.255
Maria Ramirez,
everyone calls her Sunny.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.925
Um, you know, she's a devout Catholic
and generous donor.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.219
- Um, her husband just died recently...
- Oh.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.931
...and, um, you and the sisters
should, uh, go... go see her.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.599
She lives right up the road up there.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.352
Um, great place.
She takes in nuns all the time.

32:59.395 --> 33:02.231
She does?

33:02.314 --> 33:06.318
Well, look at God just
working his ways.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.903
Well, she's a very kind person.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.655
And listen,
she has more than enough space.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.657
You guys should check it out
if you need a place to stay.

33:11.740 --> 33:15.995
All right? I think she'd love it,
so here's her number.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.997
Oops.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.709
Sorry. Um... Okay.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.043
That's for you guys.

33:24.295 --> 33:27.715
Thank you. Good day, sir. So kind.

33:32.553 --> 33:36.473
Two-hundred and seventy-three dollars.

33:36.557 --> 33:38.434
Thank you, Jesus!

33:38.517 --> 33:42.104
Yes, that is enough to get a cheap
hotel room for a couple of nights.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.398
Or a really nice hotel room for one night.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.066
No, no, no.

33:46.150 --> 33:50.279
We gotta save our money
as much as we can. We should, um...

33:50.362 --> 33:52.573
We should go stay with that nice lady.

33:52.656 --> 33:56.118
But how do...
how do you know she's so nice?

33:56.202 --> 34:01.916
Because she offers
to take in stray nuns.

34:01.999 --> 34:06.045
Um, she is probably
really religious though.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.297
And she's probably seen
a lot of nuns before.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.800
So... we should, uh...

34:11.884 --> 34:13.594
We should go do our research.

34:13.677 --> 34:16.138
- Mm-hm, up our game.
- Okay.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.974
What kind of research?

34:19.058 --> 34:23.353
Wait, Mads, you want us to go to church?

34:23.437 --> 34:26.106
Goddamn right. We're going to church!

34:26.190 --> 34:28.984
But first...
first we really need to change,

34:29.068 --> 34:32.029
'cause the only thing worse than walking
into a church impersonating a nun

34:32.112 --> 34:35.032
is walking into a police station
impersonating a cop.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.699
So let's go.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.413
God.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.928
What do you think
you're looking at, old man?

34:56.011 --> 34:57.763
Nothing.

34:57.846 --> 35:02.059
Hm. That's "Nothing, Sister," to you.

35:02.142 --> 35:07.648
- Nothing, Sister.
- Mm-hm. Good boy.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.901
Now start praying.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.861
Dear God...

35:14.363 --> 35:18.575
please help me with another sister.

35:20.703 --> 35:21.537
Addy!

35:22.663 --> 35:24.290
I like this character!

35:24.373 --> 35:26.375
- I could really get into this!
- Bitch.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.800
"Find out..." What?

35:34.883 --> 35:38.304
Fuck! No. No.

35:39.430 --> 35:41.557
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

35:48.439 --> 35:49.565
No.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.120
<i>The fucking gun!</i>

36:03.203 --> 36:04.788
Where the fuck is it?

36:04.872 --> 36:07.041
Fuck!

36:17.551 --> 36:19.970
Ah! Fuck.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.078
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.570
No! Bucky, no!

37:24.785 --> 37:26.578
No, Bucky, no!

37:48.475 --> 37:50.185
I'll open the door on one condition.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.400
I was gonna open the door.

37:56.483 --> 37:59.194
My name's Tuff, I work for Queenie.

38:02.781 --> 38:03.824
Sit.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.578
Make me a vodka.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.498
It's okay, Bucky, this is a friend.

38:11.582 --> 38:14.418
We're just playing a friendly game.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.795
- I don't think he can breathe.
- He's fucking fine.

38:16.879 --> 38:20.632
Aren't you, silly Billy?
It's just a friendly game, right.

38:20.716 --> 38:22.885
Come on, man, this has nothing
to do with the kid.

38:22.968 --> 38:27.347
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Are you allergic to bees?

38:29.641 --> 38:32.603
What a coincidence. So am I.

38:32.686 --> 38:35.772
Deathly allergic.
And when you're allergic to bees,

38:35.856 --> 38:37.816
you need to be prepared.

38:37.900 --> 38:41.153
Do you... know what one of these is?

38:41.236 --> 38:42.321
- Oh, Jesus, man, don't.
- Ah, ah.

38:42.404 --> 38:45.491
This protects you from the queen.

38:45.574 --> 38:50.412
And believe me, you do not
wanna get stung by her.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.914
What have you done?

38:54.583 --> 38:56.168
What have you done?

38:57.711 --> 38:59.213
Motherfucker!

39:59.189 --> 40:02.067
When you receive the communion,

40:02.150 --> 40:03.944
you're united with Jesus.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.825
And He becomes a part of you.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.560
Body of Christ.

41:18.477 --> 41:19.936
May God be with you.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.147
Oh, you know, very.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.025
May God be with you.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.111
- And to you too, Sister.
- Sister Julie.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.696
Thank you for coming.

41:29.780 --> 41:33.742
- Hm, Sister Julie.
- Sister Julie.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.119
I think it's time to go.

41:37.537 --> 41:38.830
What was that about?

41:53.220 --> 41:56.348
Tuff? Why is there a child?

42:01.895 --> 42:03.522
You know I hate them.

42:09.027 --> 42:12.155
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi.

42:13.490 --> 42:17.202
Yuck. Why is he tied like that?

42:17.285 --> 42:21.331
I had to use the venom
on the kid, and then...

42:21.415 --> 42:22.541
Well, look.

42:29.464 --> 42:32.175
Right?

42:32.259 --> 42:35.929
It's for softening the meat.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.139
Ah...

42:38.098 --> 42:40.642
Well...

42:40.726 --> 42:44.688
Nice to meet you... Eric.

43:01.246 --> 43:05.917
These shoes hurt my feet.

43:07.294 --> 43:09.087
I can finish this off.

43:09.171 --> 43:11.631
Tuff is so good to me.

43:17.387 --> 43:21.558
Huh... So, Eric,

43:21.641 --> 43:23.769
we've been talking about you.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.937
What's your purpose?

43:26.021 --> 43:28.064
What function do you serve?

43:29.107 --> 43:31.985
If one cannot perform his function,

43:32.068 --> 43:36.615
then another must take his place.

43:42.370 --> 43:46.708
Oh. Huh.

43:46.792 --> 43:50.420
These are the females
who lost my merchandise.

43:52.506 --> 43:56.343
Did you know there's a species
of carpenter ant in Malaysia?

43:58.011 --> 44:02.057
The queen's body
is full of poisonous venom.

44:02.140 --> 44:06.895
And if her nest
is threatened by an outsider,

44:06.978 --> 44:11.650
this magnificent creature
can explode her own head

44:11.733 --> 44:14.528
in a suicide,

44:14.611 --> 44:19.157
and release a substance onto her enemy.

44:19.241 --> 44:22.869
What a soldier.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.087
No.

44:36.550 --> 44:41.096
- No.
- This is what I'm talking about, Eric.

44:41.179 --> 44:44.474
- Oh, my God.
- Purpose.

44:44.558 --> 44:47.727
- Now you have one.
- Oh, my God.

44:47.811 --> 44:51.773
- Dinner.
- Oh, no.

46:05.221 --> 46:09.267
Sisters, welcome to my home.

46:09.351 --> 46:12.771
You'll have to excuse me,
my eyesight isn't what it used to be.

46:12.854 --> 46:14.981
You see, I've become
terribly sensitive to the light,

46:15.065 --> 46:18.193
which is a shame, because the light
is one of my favorite things

46:18.276 --> 46:20.111
about living in southern California.

46:21.237 --> 46:23.865
In a moment, Alicia will
show you to your quarters,

46:23.949 --> 46:28.203
and hope you can meet me for tea
in the sunroom once you've settled in.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.372
Let us know if you need anything.

46:30.455 --> 46:33.917
And thank you so much for coming. Alicia.

46:35.961 --> 46:38.797
Uh, thank you for, uh,

46:38.880 --> 46:43.468
having us in your godly home, ma'am.

46:43.551 --> 46:45.220
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

46:52.060 --> 46:55.605
There's so much space
just in this one area.

46:58.692 --> 47:03.071
You know, you guys,
the craziest thing about all of this

47:03.154 --> 47:07.409
is that that thing,
the thing we're wearing around our necks,

47:07.492 --> 47:10.078
is called a wimple.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.663
What the fuck is a wimple?

47:14.249 --> 47:18.336
- ...get away with it.
- Fuck you.

47:22.215 --> 47:25.468
Oh, my God.

47:27.095 --> 47:29.180
I kinda feel bad for Sunny.

47:31.391 --> 47:35.520
I mean, all this money
and no one to share it with.

47:35.603 --> 47:39.232
No, she played her cards right.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.485
She gets to do whatever she wants,
doesn't have to look after anybody.

47:46.656 --> 47:48.199
Oh, fuck!

47:48.283 --> 47:50.368
It's Eric. Should I answer it?

47:50.452 --> 47:51.661
No!

48:02.464 --> 48:03.673
No answer.

48:04.883 --> 48:06.760
Well, we'll try again later.

48:17.145 --> 48:21.775
I don't think we can hit the same spot two
days in a row. I think we should rotate.

48:21.858 --> 48:23.526
You know, the giving can't always...

48:23.610 --> 48:25.612
...be so giving.

48:31.451 --> 48:33.536
If I may make a suggestion.

48:33.620 --> 48:36.247
Outside the observatory
might be a good place.

48:36.331 --> 48:40.085
- Mm.
- Lots of foot traffic.

48:40.168 --> 48:41.544
- Oh.

48:41.628 --> 48:44.172
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

48:44.255 --> 48:48.301
- Thank you so much, Alicia.
- You're welcome.

48:48.384 --> 48:51.888
Now, if you excuse me,
before madam's breakfast gets cold.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.725
Oh, my God.

48:55.809 --> 48:57.352
She's so fucking hot.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.479
Well, that one's a hot piece of ass.

48:59.562 --> 49:01.689
Oh, my God.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.441
<i>...the body of Eric Katz,</i>

49:03.525 --> 49:05.443
<i>the actor best known
for playing Uncle Darby</i>

49:05.527 --> 49:07.904
<i>in the 90s sitcom,</i> The Sokolowiski's,

49:07.987 --> 49:11.282
<i>was discovered in his home.
Police investigators are saying</i>

49:11.366 --> 49:13.868
<i>the bizarre circumstances
surrounding his death</i>

49:13.952 --> 49:18.206
<i>are likely attributed to his rumored ties
with local drug organizations.</i>

49:18.289 --> 49:21.960
Holy fuck! Fu... fudge.

49:22.043 --> 49:24.712
<i>An unidentified 12-year-old
was also discovered in the home...</i>

49:24.796 --> 49:27.507
- Oh, my God, poor Eric.
- <i>...unconscious but alive,</i>

49:27.590 --> 49:29.759
<i>and taken to a local hospital.</i>

49:29.843 --> 49:31.845
What are we gonna do?

49:33.513 --> 49:38.226
- Fuck! Ninety-six bucks in change. God!
- This is so bad.

49:38.309 --> 49:42.272
That's all the money we have?
That's all the profits?

49:42.355 --> 49:44.274
Where the fuck is Jesus today?

49:45.692 --> 49:47.735
Maybe we're being punished.

49:47.819 --> 49:50.530
Maybe there's a curse
against people that pretend to be saints.

49:52.282 --> 49:54.659
Nuns aren't saints,
they're just regular people

49:54.742 --> 49:56.786
who work for God by doing charity.

49:56.870 --> 49:58.538
And, technically, we're homeless,

49:58.621 --> 50:02.917
so really we're just
cutting out the middle man.

50:03.001 --> 50:06.045
Oh, you can just justify anything, Mads.

50:06.129 --> 50:08.298
Why have you been on my dick
so much recently, Addy?

50:08.381 --> 50:10.133
- I love you and your dick.
- Honestly...

50:10.216 --> 50:13.219
What the fuck?

50:16.764 --> 50:20.685
Scum-sucking piece of shit!
Who the fuck fucks with nuns, huh?!

50:20.768 --> 50:22.770
Why would you steal from a nun?!

50:28.109 --> 50:33.990
<i>Now, you might think this
is a bit of an excessive reaction.</i>

50:39.245 --> 50:43.041
<i>But we all have our periods synched up,
and as you can see,</i>

50:43.124 --> 50:46.127
<i>we're already having
a pretty cramp ass day.</i>

50:49.088 --> 50:53.092
When you receive the communion,
you are united with Jesus.

50:53.176 --> 50:56.012
And He becomes a part of you.

50:59.682 --> 51:02.060
<i>You once told me
the danger of us sinning</i>

51:02.143 --> 51:04.896
<i>isn't that God would stop forgiving us,</i>

51:04.979 --> 51:08.942
<i>it's that we will stop
seeking his forgiveness.</i>

51:12.278 --> 51:14.489
<i>And so just like you wanted,</i>

51:14.572 --> 51:20.745
<i>I went to confess my sins,
past, present and future.</i>

51:29.837 --> 51:36.678
<i>Ever since I accepted You into my heart
as my Lord and my savior,</i>

51:36.761 --> 51:39.847
<i>it took me to that sacred place.</i>

52:03.162 --> 52:06.958
<i>I'm not sitting across
from a mortal man no more.</i>

52:07.041 --> 52:11.504
<i>I'm being sent directly
through him to You.</i>

53:02.764 --> 53:06.517
It appears the winds
have changed since we last met.

53:06.601 --> 53:11.898
Sunny skies have given way
to a dark cloud that now looms above you.

53:13.941 --> 53:17.695
Dark cloud? What dark cloud?

53:19.739 --> 53:24.827
This trio of sorceresses,
they will challenge your reign.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.498
They will be your undoing
if you are not careful.

53:30.541 --> 53:32.835
Those sluts stole my money.

53:32.919 --> 53:35.004
And you mentioned three of them, right?

53:35.963 --> 53:37.715
I only saw two of them.

53:39.884 --> 53:42.011
Bitch, I told you, there's three.

53:42.095 --> 53:46.265
There's three. Three sluts.
One slut, two slut, three slut...

53:46.349 --> 53:47.558
- That's not a slut.
- Oh.

53:47.642 --> 53:49.727
Just one, two, three sluts.

53:51.604 --> 53:55.024
Should I kill them?

53:56.567 --> 53:58.528
Yes.

54:04.409 --> 54:06.244
Kill them.

54:10.331 --> 54:14.085
- Nobody misses President Lincoln.
- I'm so bored.

54:14.168 --> 54:16.087
We could be at the club right now.

54:17.380 --> 54:19.298
Really?

54:19.382 --> 54:21.884
Well, we could sneak on out of here.

54:21.968 --> 54:25.138
- Mm-hm.
- Go down the lattice like ninjas.

54:25.221 --> 54:27.557
- Yeah.
- Why not?

54:27.640 --> 54:30.435
And I think Sunny's asleep.

54:32.103 --> 54:33.521
- Let's go.
- Okay.

54:33.604 --> 54:36.566
If you blow our cover, we're fucked.

54:41.779 --> 54:45.283
All right, I'll stay here. You go.

54:46.451 --> 54:49.454
- But...
- I'm on my period anyway, I'm bloated.

54:49.537 --> 54:50.788
I don't wanna be touched by,

54:50.872 --> 54:53.833
- like, gross old men.
- Okay, have a good night.

54:53.916 --> 54:55.501
You guys suck these days.

54:59.213 --> 55:00.715
Oh, I hate this thing.

55:58.606 --> 56:04.362
Huh, so this LA bimbo,
who is one of the sorceresses,

56:04.445 --> 56:08.115
she thinks she's going
to crumble our empire.

56:18.543 --> 56:21.671
She's the one that stole your stash, babe.

56:21.754 --> 56:25.633
Eric kept a ledger
in the notes on his phone, what a genius,

56:25.716 --> 56:27.969
and she's his points man.

56:29.303 --> 56:30.304
What?

56:32.139 --> 56:36.894
Well, we're going to make
a little example out of her, aren't we?

56:38.980 --> 56:41.274
Have you met my friend?

56:41.357 --> 56:44.986
The coral snake?

56:45.069 --> 56:48.239
They mostly feed on rats,

56:48.322 --> 56:51.784
bats, little rodents.

56:51.867 --> 56:54.662
But we've discovered...

56:54.745 --> 57:00.209
...this one has an insatiable appetite
on human brains.

57:00.293 --> 57:03.296
- Wanna see?
- I'm gonna film it.

57:03.379 --> 57:06.424
And then I'm gonna text it
to your sorceress friends.

58:02.605 --> 58:03.981
Something's wrong.

58:06.192 --> 58:10.363
- She's not picking up her phone.
- So call her again.

58:10.446 --> 58:14.617
I did. I called five times.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.911
I feel like, I don't know,
it's off or dead.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.538
Just... don't say the word dead.

58:19.622 --> 58:21.582
Can you please just sit the fuck down?

58:21.666 --> 58:23.417
You're making me even more crazy.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.008
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

58:31.092 --> 58:34.095
What the fuck happened?
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

58:34.178 --> 58:36.430
- Evie.
- Sit, sit.

58:38.099 --> 58:41.102
- What the fuck?
- Okay, I killed them.

58:41.185 --> 58:44.438
- Killed who?
- Uh, I killed both of them.

58:44.522 --> 58:45.773
- What?
- Who?

58:45.856 --> 58:49.318
Queenie and her psycho cowboy sidekick.

58:49.402 --> 58:52.029
- What?
- Yeah, they kidnapped me.

58:52.113 --> 58:54.949
They... they tried to kill me.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.909
- Oh, my God.
- But I... I killed them.

58:56.992 --> 59:00.121
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.289
Okay, we have to get out of LA, you guys.

59:02.373 --> 59:05.960
The cops are gonna come after me.
I'm a little scared.

59:07.420 --> 59:09.880
- Why?
- Because I killed them.

59:09.964 --> 59:12.383
Calm down, calm down.

59:12.466 --> 59:14.552
Let me just think.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.346
We're fine.

59:17.430 --> 59:18.973
- We're fine, you know why?
- Why?

59:19.056 --> 59:23.352
Because the cops, they don't give a shit.

59:23.436 --> 59:26.731
Yeah. They're never gonna find out
because they don't care!

59:26.814 --> 59:30.818
That's just two less bottom-feeding
drug dealers that are gone!

59:30.901 --> 59:34.363
I mean, you literally
just did their jobs tonight.

59:34.447 --> 59:36.741
That they... Hallelujah!

59:36.824 --> 59:40.161
Right?

59:40.244 --> 59:43.038
Yeah, you killed
the motherfucker who killed Eric.

59:43.122 --> 59:44.832
An eye for an eye.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.168
Hey, Mads, isn't that in the Bible?

59:47.251 --> 59:50.546
You're sure the fuck right it is.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.423
You know... you know what else?

59:52.506 --> 59:54.967
- What?
- We're in the clear.

59:55.050 --> 59:58.012
- Oh, my God.
- You know what that means, right?

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.139
There's no more killers anymore.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:02.600
- Mm-hm.
- We have money coming in.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:06.103
- Oh, yeah.
- We have a roof over our heads.

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:09.732
This is literally our rebirth.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.650
Oh, my God, you're right.

01:00:11.734 --> 01:00:13.986
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my God!

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.405
- I can't believe our luck.
- Dude, we're so fucking lucky.

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:18.699
No, no, it's not luck!

01:00:18.783 --> 01:00:23.704
It's... It is exactly divine intervention.

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:27.750
I mean, it's clear as day.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.795
This is Jesus coming down
and taking the wheel.

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.546
Oh, my God.

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:35.591
I mean, we all knew he would...
lead us down the right path,

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:39.637
but... but tonight he actually did it.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.138
Yeah.

01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:42.890
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.519
I didn't even
believe in God before.

01:00:46.602 --> 01:00:49.230
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, I was so fucking scared.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:52.483
Oh, my God,
I was too. I love you guys.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.109
Oh, my God, tell me
everything that happened!

01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:56.821
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, so okay.

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:58.614
- There were snakes.
- What?

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.783
Two snakes, a black and a red one.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.201
What were they
doing with the snakes?

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:03.828
Oh, my God, so one was like...

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:21.220
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:51.041
I know what
you're planning on doing.

01:01:55.421 --> 01:02:00.467
And I'd think real long
and hard before doing it, if I were you.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:06.056
Yeah, well, you are me.

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:12.021
You've been given a rare gift.
A clean slate.

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:15.190
Why do you always have
to fall back on bad habits?

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:22.114
I've made my decision,
and I feel bad enough about it already.

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.033
So can you just drop it?

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.998
But do bad girls go to heaven too?

01:02:36.045 --> 01:02:38.088
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.453
<i>Here's the thing:</i>

01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:54.206
<i>I know You like all that</i>

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:59.670
<i>meditation, hallelujah,
peace on earth bullshit.</i>

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:02.631
<i>But have You ever done heroin?</i>

01:04:03.382 --> 01:04:05.384
<i>We both know I have.</i>

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:09.555
<i>'Cause there's not one minute in my life</i>

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:11.932
<i>where I'm not thinking about it.</i>

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:16.478
<i>It's the total escape of feeling.</i>

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:20.232
<i>Pure oblivion.</i>

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:24.820
<i>Sweet Jesus,</i>

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:29.700
<i>she almost makes me forget You.</i>

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.699
Hello?

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:20.375
Help! Help! Somebody!

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:23.754
Somebody help! Help! Help!

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.460
JC?

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.466
Holy shit!

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.136
God's a woman?

01:06:13.053 --> 01:06:14.721
With tattoos?

01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:20.602
Whoa. Fuck me, that's badass.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.947
Holy shit, I've been waiting
to meet You my whole life.

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:34.032
Wow.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:41.540
Jesus.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.794
I'm sorry.

01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:49.715
I love You so much.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:53.927
I'm sorry I'm such a fuckup.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.556
But from now on...

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:01.768
I swear,
I wanna do right by You, Lord.

01:07:03.896 --> 01:07:07.399
I do, I... I wanna be different.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:11.236
And I know I... I know I've been saying
that this whole time, but...

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.489
We also know that...

01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:20.370
you know, I kinda have a gift
for rationalizing things.

01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:28.545
From now on, I wanna be the kinda person
that makes You proud.

01:07:31.632 --> 01:07:34.009
I swear, from this rebirth and this...

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:39.556
this fresh start that You've
so generously given me...

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:46.939
I swear it in my soul, Lord,
I swear it in my soul.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.028
Thank you, Lord.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:56.949
Thanks.

01:08:08.335 --> 01:08:09.586
Honey?

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:12.756
Sweetie, it's time to take your meds.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:29.398
Where... where the fuck is Jesus?

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.858
He's in your heart, sweetie.

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:33.819
He's in all of our hearts.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.037
- Mads.
- Mads.

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.456
Are you okay?

01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:03.473
Hello? Alicia?

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.892
Sisters?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.310
Who is that?

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.524
Beautiful place you have here, madam.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.819
- Wouldn't you agree, my dear?
- Yeah, very fancy.

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:18.447
Sort of lovely old knickknacks.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.282
Who are you people?

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:23.076
Oh, who we are is of little consequence.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.246
But a little bee told me

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:30.792
that you might be hiding
a few fugitives from justice.

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:32.586
Fugitives?

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.339
Yeah, well, you didn't think
they was real nuns, did you?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:40.510
Oh, my word. Seems like someone
has been taking advantage

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:44.180
of the kindness
of a lonely, stupid old woman.

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:45.515
Ooh...

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:47.725
Nobody's here,
and if you don't leave,

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.519
I'm going to call the cops.

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:53.899
Since it appears
that you're at a loss for sight,

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:57.486
here's my blow... by blow!

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:03.950
- Now, my associate, Tuff...
- Associate?

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:07.120
I'm sorry, I just want to be professional.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:11.917
Oh. Okay. Fine.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.338
- And now, my partner and paramour...
- Okay.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:20.675
...Tuff, is standing right above you.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:24.638
He has a gun to your head.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.391
And if you don't tell us
where those little bitches are

01:10:27.474 --> 01:10:29.893
by the time I count to three,

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:34.564
he's going to blow your old,
rich brain out. One!

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.733
If it's money you want,
I have money.

01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:40.404
It's not about money! Two!

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:42.155
Dear Lord Jesus,

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:46.118
- assign your spirit unto me.
- Three!

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.083
- It's the God squad, bitch!
- That's right.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.046
Oh!

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:00.465
Tuff!

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:10.600
Tuff!

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:21.862
So you believe in Jesus?

01:11:24.406 --> 01:11:26.658
Jesus is just a statue.

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:28.910
Go.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.794
He's made as a cruel construct

01:11:37.878 --> 01:11:40.338
by this old, white male,

01:11:40.422 --> 01:11:45.844
who was so vulnerable, so weak.

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:50.265
You better keep me dead,
or I'm gonna sing.

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.143
<i>âª Joy to the world âª</i>

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.979
<i>âª The nuns are fucked âª</i>

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.899
Will you just shut the fuck up?!

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.286
<i>Okay, well, I'll admit,</i>

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:17.292
<i>maybe another one of those
potentially excessive overreactions.</i>

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.669
<i>But, hey, whatever.</i>

01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:23.048
<i>It's just me over here
doing some of God's dirty work.</i>

01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:27.594
<i>And, come on,
someone had to shut that bitch up.</i>

01:13:01.795 --> 01:13:04.089
<i>Sunny invited us all to stay.</i>

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:08.301
<i>But if this was my first step
into my born again virginity,</i>

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:11.179
I wanted to start fresh across the board.

01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:14.057
<i>That means saying goodbye to my girls.</i>

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:20.855
<i>Instead of turning everybody into
the police for impersonating nuns,</i>

01:13:20.939 --> 01:13:23.984
<i>Sister Julie made them
pay penance to the church.</i>

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.405
<i>Which I hear is a pretty shit fine.</i>

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:35.245
<i>I also heard the church
got a new priest too.</i>

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:40.667
<i>Apparently, after our carnal encounter,
Father Sexy Pants had a crisis of faith.</i>

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.546
<i>He gave up the priesthood
and decided to take up male modeling.</i>

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:46.548
<i>Yeah, it really suits him too.</i>

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.675
<i>And, as for me...</i>

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.680
<i>Well, as for me,
you weren't done with me yet.</i>

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:59.978
<i>I don't know if the father
IS Eric, that priest,</i>

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:02.689
<i>or fuck, could be anyone else.</i>

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:06.443
<i>All know I is, sweet Lord Jesus,</i>

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:10.280
<i>You brought me to the City of Angels
for a purpose,</i>

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:14.242
<i>and now I'm off to spread Your light.</i>

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:21.666
I love you, Jesus!

01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:26.755
JC's my man!
