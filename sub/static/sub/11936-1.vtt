01:02.312 --> 01:05.857
The National Rifle Association
has produced a film

01:05.941 --> 01:08.192
which you are sure to find
of great interest.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.485
Let's look at it.

01:11.822 --> 01:15.408
It was the morning of April 20, 1999,

01:15.492 --> 01:18.745
and it was pretty much
like any other morning in America.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.622
The farmer did his chores.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.793
The milkman made his deliveries.

01:25.878 --> 01:30.089
The president bombed another country
whose name we couldn't pronounce.

01:30.799 --> 01:35.470
Out in Fargo, North Dakota,
Kerry McWilliams went on his morning walk.

01:35.554 --> 01:40.016
Back in Michigan, Mrs. Hughes welcomed
her students for another day of school.

01:41.602 --> 01:46.856
And out in a little town in Colorado,
two boys went bowling at 6:00 in the morning.

01:46.940 --> 01:51.861
Yes, it was a typical day
in the United States of America.

01:56.909 --> 01:57.950
May I help you?

01:58.035 --> 02:00.036
Yeah. I'm here to open up an account.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.663
Okay. What type account would you like?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.208
I want the account
where I can get the free gun.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.459
Okay.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.211
I had spotted an ad
in the local Michigan paper

02:09.295 --> 02:12.465
that said if you opened an account
at North Country Bank,

02:12.549 --> 02:14.133
the bank would give you a gun.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.219
You do a CD and we'll hand you a gun.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.472
We have a whole brochure here
that you can look at.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.934
Once we do the background check
and everything, it's yours to go.

02:23.018 --> 02:26.854
Okay. Um, all right.
Well, that's the account I'd like to open.

02:26.939 --> 02:31.818
We have a vault which at all times
we keep at least 500 firearms.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.569
500 of these you have in your vault?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.112
-In our vault.
-Wow.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.949
-We have to do a background check.
-At the bank here, or...?

02:38.033 --> 02:40.660
At the bank, which,
we are a licensed firearm dealer.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.204
You are? You're a bank
and a licensed firearm dealer.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.415
What do I put for race?
White or Caucasian or...?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.251
-Caucasian.
-Caucasian.

02:48.335 --> 02:53.297
I knew you were gonna make me
spell the – Cau-ca-sian.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.507
-Is that right?
-Yes.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.925
Thank you s –

02:56.009 --> 02:58.302
I don't think that's the part
they're gonna be worried about.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.889
Um, "Have you ever been
adjudicated mentally defective,

03:01.974 --> 03:04.642
or have you ever been committed
to a mental institution?"

03:04.726 --> 03:06.644
I've never been committed
to a mental institution.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.814
What does that mean, "Have I ever been
adjudicated mentally defective"?

03:09.898 --> 03:12.233
Would be something involved with a crime.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.820
With a crime. Okay. So if I'm just normally
mentally defective, but not criminal –

03:15.904 --> 03:16.821
Exactly.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.241
-There you go, Mike.
-Okay. Thank you very much. Wow.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.451
-I have one personally.
-That's a nice action.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.078
-It is. And it's –
-You got one?

03:24.162 --> 03:26.581
It's a straight shooter, let me tell you.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.502
Wow. Sweet.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.004
Well, here's my first question.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.506

handing out guns in a bank?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.936
Just press the trigger and listen!

04:32.189 --> 04:34.023
It sounds like a gun battle over there!

04:34.107 --> 04:36.609
-Is it real?
-Looks like real!

04:36.693 --> 04:39.403

04:41.698 --> 04:44.408
Military and Western rifles
by Marx!

04:45.535 --> 04:47.536
This was my first gun.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.540
I couldn't wait to go outside
and shoot up the neighborhood.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.334

By the time I was a teenager
I was such a good shot,

05:06.556 --> 05:10.267
I won the National Rifle Association's
Marksman Award.

05:10.352 --> 05:14.146
You see, I grew up in Michigan,
a gun-lover's paradise.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.232
And so did this man,

05:16.316 --> 05:20.736
the Oscar-winning actor
and president of the National Rifle Association,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.072
Mr. Charlton Heston.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.037
We come from a state
where everyone loves to go hunting.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.250
- Ha!
- Even the dogs.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.003
There were actually, uh,
two of the hunters at the camp.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.256
They thought they'd get a few pictures
of the dog dressed up as a hunter,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.842
to kinda just have some fun around camp.

05:42.926 --> 05:47.388
And one of the guys had the idea that,
"Why don't we sling a rifle on the dog's back

05:47.472 --> 05:50.683
to make the pictures
a little more interesting."

05:50.767 --> 05:55.146
The victim was kneeling down in front of the dog
when the weapon slipped.

05:55.230 --> 05:59.608
The one round
went through the victim's shin,

05:59.693 --> 06:02.486
the right part of his shin,
and came out through the back of his calf.

06:02.571 --> 06:06.323
Was the dog held at all
for any period of time by the police?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.242
No, it wasn't. No.

06:08.326 --> 06:13.414
Um, in Michigan, law basically states
that people can commit crimes,

06:13.498 --> 06:17.710
that animals aren't some form of, uh,

06:17.794 --> 06:19.295
whatever that could commit a crime.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.173
An animal cannot commit a crime
or be charged with a crime in this state.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.299
Exactly.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.635
Is it possible the dog
knew what it was doing?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.639
That I don't know.
I really wouldn't be able to tell you that.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.642
The dog was cute dressed up as a hunter.
There's no doubt about it.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.978
I mean, it was – it was a funny picture,

06:36.063 --> 06:38.439
um, uh, you know, to look at.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.857
It was kind of neat.

06:41.985 --> 06:45.696
Yep, this was the kind of place I was from.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.032
- A box of 270s.
- Coming up.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.578
-There you go.
-Perfect.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.086
- oh-oh-oh! Sorry about that. Sorry.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.255
It's all right. Didn't discharge.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.841
You don't need no gun control.
You know what you need?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.260
We need some bullet control.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.013
We need to control the bullets.
That's right.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.933
I think all bullets should cost $5,000.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.936
--$5,000 for a bullet.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.062
You know why?

07:18.146 --> 07:22.566
'Cause if a bullet cost $5,000,
there'd be no more innocent bystanders.

07:24.653 --> 07:29.573
Every time somebody get shot people'd be like,
"Damn, he must have did something.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.828
Shit, they put $50,000 worth of bullets
in his ass!"

07:37.624 --> 07:42.086
People will think before they kill somebody
if a bullet cost $5,000.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.840
"Man, I would blow your fucking head off
if I could afford it.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.514
I'm gonna get me another job.
I'm gonna start saving some money.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.975
And you a dead man!

07:56.059 --> 07:58.435
You better hope
I can't get no bullets on layaway."

08:01.523 --> 08:04.567
Not far from where
Charlton Heston and I grew up

08:04.651 --> 08:07.987
is a training ground
for the Michigan Militia.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.488
Why do you use the bowling pins?

08:09.573 --> 08:14.076
From a self-defense
or technical standpoint, it's a small target

08:14.161 --> 08:16.996
which also represents the vitals
on a – on a –

08:17.080 --> 08:19.373
on a human being,
should you ever have to shoot at one.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.336
The Michigan Militia
became known around the world

08:24.421 --> 08:27.798
when, on April 19, 1995,

08:27.883 --> 08:31.218
two guys living in Michigan
who had attended militia meetings,

08:31.303 --> 08:33.971
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols,

08:34.054 --> 08:36.849
blew up the federal building
in Oklahoma City,

08:36.933 --> 08:39.351
killing 168 people.

08:40.145 --> 08:45.733
The Michigan Militia wanted everyone to know
that they were nothing like McVeigh and Nichols.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.443
This is an American tradition.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.112
It's an American responsibility to be armed.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.781
If you're not armed,
you're not responsible.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.368
Who's gonna defend your kids?
The cops? The federal government?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.495
No. None of them.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.165
It's your job to defend you and yours.

09:01.249 --> 09:05.002
If you don't do it,
you're in dereliction of duty as an American.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.086
Period.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.756
We're just here to let them know
that, hey, we're here to help.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.758
We're not the bogeymen
that we're made out to be.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.760
We're here to help and defend
the people of this country.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.639
I'm sure you guys are the kind of people
people would like to have as their neighbor.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.016
If somebody's in need,
you're there to help them.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.603
Pretty much. We're all normal people.
We all have regular jobs, professions.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.105
-And this is what we do on our own time.
-What kind of job do you have?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.107
-I'm a draftsman.
-Draftsman? How about you?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.943
-Unemployed right now.
-Unemployed?

09:29.027 --> 09:31.445
-Frank, what do you do for a living?
-I work for a heat-treating company.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.572
- I drive truck for them.
--huh.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.617
-How about you?
-I'm a real estate negotiator.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.455
White collar all the way.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.376
You don't bring that with you, though, do ya,
when you're negotiating the real estate?

09:45.460 --> 09:46.961
-No.
-All right.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.088
-Where do you live? In suburban Detroit?
-Westland.

09:49.172 --> 09:52.466
- So what do you have in your home?
- Smith & Wesson nine millimeter.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.717
-Nine millimeter?
-Yep.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.302
-How about you?
-With hollow points.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.637
-12-gauge.
-12-gauge at home?

09:56.721 --> 09:57.930
-Yep.
-Mm-hmm. How about you?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.473
-M16.
-At home?

09:59.557 --> 10:01.600
-Yep.
-Yeah?

10:01.685 --> 10:02.977
- At the ready.
- I don't agree –

10:03.061 --> 10:04.812
- Huh?
- I don't agree with that.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.273
'Cause you have to worry where your rounds
are going. Do you have frangibles in it?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.483
I know where they're gonna go
when I aim and shoot.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.902
Whose idea was the calendar?

10:11.987 --> 10:14.905
-That would probably be Kristen.
-A picture's worth a thousand words.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.701
I mean, it's not – A, it demonstrates
a level of sophistication

10:18.785 --> 10:21.370
that you wouldn't expect out of militia.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.415
B, you know, we're people too.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.625
-Right.
-And we have a lot of fun with it.

10:26.710 --> 10:31.547
It was a fund-raiser,
and it showed that we're not so serious.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.467
You know, we're not these conspiracy nuts
who wouldn't want our pictures to get out.

10:35.552 --> 10:40.014
And it was a fun fund-raiser, you know?

10:40.098 --> 10:43.142
I've had guns, um,

10:43.226 --> 10:46.103
pretty much since I was old enough
to have them.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.689
And I learned how to use them.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.065
- Um –

10:50.150 --> 10:52.109
You're silly.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.403
Because – Because being a female,
number one,

10:54.487 --> 10:58.657
I felt it was important to be able
to protect myself with the best means possible.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.951
And one of those means is having a gun.

11:01.036 --> 11:04.747
When a criminal breaks into your house,
who's the first person you're gonna call?

11:04.831 --> 11:07.958
Most people will call the police
because they have guns.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.045
Cut out the middleman. Take care of it.

11:11.129 --> 11:14.006
- Take care of your own family yourself.

11:14.090 --> 11:18.093
If you're not going to
protect your family, who is?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.637
We're not racists.
We're not extremists.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.264
We're not fundamentalists.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.517
We're not terrorists or militants
or other such nonsense.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.103
-We're citizens.
-We're just concerned citizens.

11:28.188 --> 11:32.358
We have a desire to fulfill our responsibilities
and duties as Americans,

11:32.442 --> 11:34.443
and an armed citizenry is part of that.

Soybeans. Tofu soybeans.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.025
in the district next to mine.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.778
On this farm in Decker, Michigan,

12:17.862 --> 12:21.365
McVeigh and the Nichols brothers
made practice bombs before Oklahoma City.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.286
Terry and James were both arrested
in connection to the bombing.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.540
US attorneys formally linked
the Nichols brothers of Michigan

12:29.624 --> 12:32.376
with Oklahoma bomb suspect
Timothy McVeigh.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.253
Officials charged James,
who was at the hearing,

12:34.337 --> 12:36.255
and Terry, who was not,

12:36.339 --> 12:39.758
with conspiring to make
and possess small bombs.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.928
Terry Nichols was convicted
and received a life sentence.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.098
Timothy McVeigh was executed.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.310
But the feds didn't have the goods on James,
so the charges were dropped.

12:50.395 --> 12:54.940
I'm just glad to be out and free
so I can get on with my life.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.943
-Did Timothy McVeigh ever stay here?
-Yes. Yes.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.903
He stayed here several times.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.948
For the longest period,
about three months or so. I don't know.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.450
But he was a nice guy.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.034
- Decent guy.
- Yeah.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.954
- They didn't find anything on this farm?
- As to what?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.165
-Bomb-making material?
-Any kind of explosives.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.585
Yeah, I had blasting caps,
dynamite blasting caps,

13:14.669 --> 13:18.881
dynamite fuse, black powder –
you know, for muzzle loaders.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.008
Sure. Diesel fuel, fertilizer.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.218
But that is normal farm stuff.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.888
That is no way connected
in any way whatsoever

13:25.972 --> 13:28.891
to the Oklahoma City bombing
or bomb-making.

13:28.975 --> 13:33.520
Them people, law enforcement,
if you want to call them that, were here,

13:33.605 --> 13:36.315
and they were shaking in their shoes.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.735
They were physically shaking.
Scared to death.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.944
Of?

13:41.029 --> 13:43.739
Because they thought
this was gonna be another Waco.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.532
Because certain people,

13:47.452 --> 13:50.037
namely my ex-wife and other people,

13:50.914 --> 13:53.165
said I'm a radical, I'm a wild man,

13:53.249 --> 13:55.959
I got a gun under every arm,
down every leg,

13:56.044 --> 13:58.462
in every shoe, every corner of the house.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.256
You say anything to me, I'll shoot you.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.426
If the people find out
how they've been ripped off

14:04.511 --> 14:09.932
and – and enslaved in this country
by the government,

14:10.016 --> 14:11.850
by the powers to be...

14:14.687 --> 14:18.440
they will revolt with anger,

14:19.275 --> 14:21.276
with merciless anger.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.278
There'll be blood running in the streets.

14:23.363 --> 14:28.450
When a government turns tyrannical,
it is your duty to overthrow it.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.369
Well, why not use Gandhi's way?

14:30.453 --> 14:33.747
He didn't have any guns,
and he beat the British Empire.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.250
I'm not familiar with that.

14:39.379 --> 14:43.674
Oscoda has a bad habit of raising psychos.
Bad habit of it.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.133
This is Brent.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.427
And this is his buddy, D.J.

14:47.512 --> 14:52.391
They live in Oscoda, Michigan,
across the bay from the Nichols' farm.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.102
Eric Harris, who would later
go on to commit the massacre

14:55.186 --> 14:57.688
at Columbine High School in Colorado,

14:57.772 --> 14:59.856
spent part of his childhood here.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.569
Eric lived on the air force base in Oscoda,

15:03.653 --> 15:06.989
where his dad flew planes
during the Gulf War.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.783
Twenty percent of all the bombs
dropped in that war

15:09.867 --> 15:12.995
were from planes
that took off from Oscoda.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.957
I asked Brent if he remembered
anything about Eric.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.627
I never knew him, but I knew of him.
He left here before I got here.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.713
I've only lived here
about seven years, off and on.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.674
He's about the same age as you,
so you must have people in your class that –

15:25.758 --> 15:28.844
Yeah, like a friend of mine.
He knows him. He was in class with him.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.470
He's lived up here all of his life.

15:30.555 --> 15:34.141
I went to school with him,
and it shocked me to hear it on the news.

15:34.225 --> 15:39.146
You know, that especially a kid from here
would be doing that.

15:39.230 --> 15:42.774
I didn't last too long in this high school here.
I got kicked out. I got expelled.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.569
-Why was that?
-I had a run-in with a kid one time.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.030
And I pulled a weapon on him –
pulled a gun on him.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.240
-A gun? What kind of gun?
-Nine millimeter.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.576
I could've made a mess out of that situation.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.994
- Could've been worse.
- A lot worse.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.413
-You could've been Eric Harris.
-I could've been.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.958
-So they kicked you out of school?
-They kicked me out for 380 days.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.086
Or 165 days.
Whatever a full school year is.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.549
Matter of fact, for the longest time that's
what my plan was – to move out to Colorado.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.134
Colorado?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.345
'Cause I've got, you know, family out there.

16:11.429 --> 16:15.766
Matter of fact, one of my uncles
is a janitor for the Columbine school.

16:15.850 --> 16:16.850
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.269
After Columbine,
what was it like here in Oscoda?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.480
My name was second highest
on the bomb list

16:21.564 --> 16:25.067
because of the reputation
you get in this town.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.903
Why? Why was your name –
You mean they did a list of–

16:27.987 --> 16:29.571
Of suspects.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.575
Of students who potentially would
call in a bomb threat after Columbine?

16:33.660 --> 16:37.204
-And you were number two on the list?
-I was second or third on the list, yeah.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.039
Why is that?

16:39.123 --> 16:43.669
Because the whole fact is, like I said,
this town really gets people down.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.213
Yeah, but why did they single you out?

16:46.297 --> 16:48.840
Because I was a troubled kid and –

16:48.925 --> 16:50.842
- Were you in trouble in school?
- Yeah.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.721
But why did they put you at number two
on their list, after Columbine,

16:54.806 --> 16:56.932
of the students that could be a threat?

16:58.768 --> 17:01.478
-Come on. There must be a reason.
-Well, okay.

17:01.562 --> 17:05.065
The thing is, I have a thing called
The Anarchist Cookbook.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.526
It shows you how to make bombs
and stuff like that in it.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.570
If there was anything went wrong, they're
gonna come to me first, and I don't need that.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.741
Just 'cause you owned a copy of the book?
Never made a bomb yourself?

17:14.826 --> 17:17.327
Nope – As in – I've made 'em.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.832
It was nothing big.
It wasn't even as big as a pipe bomb.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.419
It's just, you know, like a little
tennis ball bomb or something like that.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.674
Out of The Anarchist Cookbook,
the latest thing I built –

17:32.009 --> 17:33.719
I think it would have to be –

17:33.803 --> 17:36.847
I think I made about
a good five-gallon drum of napalm.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.767
You know, homemade napalm.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.061
-Kids knew that you were doing this?
-Yeah.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.522
-So you were number two, then, on the list?
-Right.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.399
Who was number one?

17:47.483 --> 17:51.695
I don't know. They never told me that name.
Which kind of made me mad.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.698
-'Cause you didn't make it to number one?
-Cause I didn't make it to number one.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.034
I know it's kinda silly, but, you know,

17:58.119 --> 18:00.662
I-I guess it had been
kind of like an ego thing there,

18:00.747 --> 18:03.582
knowing that I was number one
at something in Oscoda,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.042
even though it was a bomb threat list.

18:06.127 --> 18:10.088
Do you believe it was right
to blow up the building in Oklahoma City?

18:10.173 --> 18:11.882
-I'm not saying you did it.
-No. No. No.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.134
-I'm just saying, was it right?
-Why was it blowed up?

18:14.218 --> 18:16.511
That's a good question.
Why was that building blowed up?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.472
-And who blew it up?
-But whoev –

18:18.556 --> 18:21.099
-But if someone did it, it would be wrong?
-Yeah.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.935
It is wrong to take the lives of those people.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.979
Yeah.

18:26.063 --> 18:30.817
I use the pen,
because the pen is mightier than the sword.

18:30.902 --> 18:35.030
But you always must keep a sword handy
for when the pen fails.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.658
I sleep with a .44 magnum under my pillow.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.453
Come on.
That's what everyone says.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.164
-Is that true?
-It's true.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.166
-If we were to go in –
-The whole world knows that.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.544
If we were to go look under your pillow
right now, would we see a .44 magnum?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.254
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Honestly?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.882
Would you take us and show us right now?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.511
He took me into his bedroom,
but told the cameraman to stay out.

18:57.595 --> 19:01.640
Sure enough, there was a .44 magnum
under his pillow.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.350
There it is. Okay.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.644
- Is it loaded?
- Ay-yi-yi.

19:05.728 --> 19:08.647
--Okay. I believe you.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.941
--Don't do that!

19:11.025 --> 19:14.236
Don't – Don't do that!
Don't put the gun to your head!

19:14.320 --> 19:15.612
--Geez.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.073
-I'm not gonna get hurt.
-This thing is loaded.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.533
It's loaded. It's safe.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.869
You've got to pull the trigger,
or pull the hammer and shoot it.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.412
Mmm. Put the hammer back.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.748
No one has the right to tell me
I can't have it.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.668
That is protected under our constitution.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.254
-Where does it say a handgun is protected?
-No, "gun."

19:32.338 --> 19:34.923
-We should – Every citizen –
-It doesn't say "gun."

19:35.007 --> 19:37.217
-It says "arms."
-"Arms." What is "arms"?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.220
-Could be a nuclear weapon.
-Not – That's right. Could be a nuclear weapon.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.223
Do you think you should have the right
to have weapons-grade plutonium here?

19:43.307 --> 19:46.309
-We should be able to have anything –
-Should you have weapons-grade plutonium?

19:46.394 --> 19:47.519
I don't want it.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.230
But should you have the right to have it
if you did want it?

19:50.314 --> 19:52.440
- That should be restricted.-

19:52.525 --> 19:54.442
So you do believe in some restrictions.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.195
Well... there's wackos out there.

But the thing is, he can't see it.
He's blind.

Kerry has had a love affair with guns

20:37.528 --> 20:40.655

This is a great place

21:06.974 --> 21:09.184
A really great place to raise your kids.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.604
Very, uh, close-knit community we have here.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.023
Everybody looks out for everybody.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.900
- Good people.
- Good people.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.361
This just happens to be a place where

21:19.445 --> 21:23.156
two young men made very bad,
very wrong decisions,

21:23.240 --> 21:26.785
and there has been international notoriety
as a result of it.

21:26.869 --> 21:30.121
Other than that, I don't know
that Littleton is a lot different

21:30.206 --> 21:32.916
than a whole lot of other
suburban communities.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.758
Good morning, Mr. Edwards,
members of the board.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.220
I'd like to report
that I've found the perfect location

21:45.304 --> 21:48.223
for our new corporate office,
South Metro Denver.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.685
You can see I don't need these,

21:51.769 --> 21:53.353
because South Metro Denver

21:53.437 --> 21:58.024
has about the same amount of sunshine
and precipitation as Southern California.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.694
It's so incredible, you're just gonna
have to see it for yourselves.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.862
How's this look, Mr. Edwards?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.784
--Good deal. Yeah.

22:12.665 --> 22:17.293
We're south of Denver
in a community called Littleton.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.672
And, um, this house
is pretty much your average,

22:20.756 --> 22:23.133
uh, middle-class, suburban home.

22:23.217 --> 22:26.928
The burglar, the rapist is still here
in the neighborhood somewhere.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.764
And so citizens sometimes think that, uh –

22:29.849 --> 22:31.641
I have people tell me all the time –

22:31.726 --> 22:35.145
Where exactly is the burglar
or rapist right now?

22:35.229 --> 22:38.148
If I was to try and stab you
through this right here –

22:38.232 --> 22:40.191
That – I'm only –
You're gonna have to be really close.

22:40.276 --> 22:44.112
-Right. And here's the bottom line on this –
-What if I had a spear?

22:44.196 --> 22:47.699
Now, downstairs is where the safe room
was constructed.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.994
And this is a solid core door.
Very heavy door.

22:51.078 --> 22:54.330
And now the criminal
has to break through this door.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.041
So you've created another barrier.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.585
-An ax would do it.
-An ax would do it.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.129
I think Columbine did a couple of things.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.258
One is, it changed –
it changed how we talk.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.218
-That's the first thing, because –
-How's that?

23:07.303 --> 23:10.555
Well, for instance, if I say Columbine,
everybody knows what it means.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.767
I don't have to explain to you
that Columbine, um...

23:16.854 --> 23:19.814
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I just...

23:19.899 --> 23:21.900
-What's wrong?
-I-I just –

23:21.984 --> 23:24.486
Sometimes Columbine bothers me.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.780
-I'll be fine. Just a minute.
-That's okay. That's okay.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.073
Um...

23:32.620 --> 23:35.663
There – there's something, um –

23:37.666 --> 23:41.753
something overwhelming
about that kind of, um...

23:42.755 --> 23:46.424
viciousness,
that kind of predatory action,

23:46.509 --> 23:49.010
that kind of indiscriminate,

23:49.095 --> 23:51.429
um, killing.

23:56.310 --> 23:59.312
This facility where we're located right now

23:59.396 --> 24:03.066
and two other major facilities
where our employees work

24:03.150 --> 24:06.194
are either in or very near Littleton.

24:06.278 --> 24:10.115
So we have over 5,000 employees
at these facilities,

24:10.199 --> 24:12.700
quite a number of whom live in Littleton,

24:12.785 --> 24:15.328
many of whom have children
who attend Columbine High School.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.915
I suppose in one way you could say
that what happened at Columbine High School

24:18.999 --> 24:23.920
is a microcosm, uh,
of what happens throughout the world.

24:24.672 --> 24:28.258
You know the signs we see around here,
the ones that say "We are Columbine"?

24:28.342 --> 24:30.301
Is that how you, Lockheed Martin, feels?

24:30.386 --> 24:33.221
That you're the biggest employer
here in Littleton,

24:33.305 --> 24:34.806
you're the biggest weapons-maker.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.349
"We are Columbine"?

24:36.433 --> 24:38.726
I think we probably embody that spirit

24:38.811 --> 24:40.770
that, yeah, we're all members
of this community,

24:40.855 --> 24:45.275
and it behooves us to help one another
and to reach out to assist one another.

24:45.359 --> 24:50.238
He told us that no one in Littleton,
including the executives at Lockheed,

24:50.322 --> 24:54.117
could figure out why the boys at Columbine
had resorted to violence.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.744
Why – Why would kids do this?

24:56.829 --> 24:59.747
Some of the root of that

24:59.832 --> 25:04.043
probably has to do
with their anger about various issues.

25:04.128 --> 25:08.464
And we became aware of a program
that provides anger management training.

25:08.549 --> 25:13.303
So we made a $100,000 contribution
to the Jefferson County Schools

25:13.387 --> 25:15.680
to use this training in the schools.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.392
We hope to help both teachers and students

25:19.476 --> 25:23.104
learn alternative ways to deal with anger.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.523
So you don't think our kids
say to themselves,

25:25.608 --> 25:30.862
"Well, gee, Dad goes off to the factory
every day and he built missiles.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.947
These were weapons of mass destruction.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.783
What's the difference
between that mass destruction

25:35.868 --> 25:39.495
and the mass destruction
over at Columbine High School?"

25:39.580 --> 25:43.416
I guess I don't see that connection –
that specific connection –

25:43.500 --> 25:48.630
because the missiles that you're talking about
were built and designed to defend us

25:48.714 --> 25:51.507
from somebody else
who would be aggressors against us.

25:51.592 --> 25:55.762
Societies and countries and governments
do things that annoy one another.

25:55.846 --> 25:59.432
But we have to learn to deal
with that annoyance

25:59.516 --> 26:03.019
or that anger or that frustration
in appropriate ways.

26:03.103 --> 26:07.523
We don't get irritated with somebody
and, just 'cause we're mad at 'em,

26:07.608 --> 26:10.860
uh, drop a bomb or shoot at 'em
or fire a missile at 'em.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.340
My word!

28:42.221 --> 28:43.846
South of Denver and Littleton,

28:43.931 --> 28:46.641
on the grounds
of the US Air Force Academy,

28:46.725 --> 28:49.310
there sits an actual B-52 bomber.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.354
The plaque underneath it proudly proclaims

28:51.438 --> 28:54.315
that this plane killed Vietnamese people

28:54.400 --> 28:57.276
on Christmas Eve, 1972.

28:57.361 --> 29:01.072
It was the largest bombing campaign
of the Vietnam War.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.325
Just outside Denver is Rocky Flats,

29:04.410 --> 29:07.036
the largest plutonium
weapons-making factory in the world,

29:07.746 --> 29:10.623
and now a massive radioactive dump.

29:10.707 --> 29:14.085
A few miles away,
buried inside a mountain, is NORAD,

29:14.169 --> 29:16.421
which oversees our nuclear missiles,

29:16.505 --> 29:19.507
many of which dot the Colorado landscape.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.722
And once a month,
Lockheed transports one of its rockets,

29:26.807 --> 29:28.516
with its Pentagon payload,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.393
through the streets of Littleton,

29:30.477 --> 29:33.312
passing nearby Columbine High School

29:33.397 --> 29:37.525
on its way to an air force base
on the other side of Denver.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.653
The rockets are transported
in the middle of the night

29:40.737 --> 29:43.531
while the children of Columbine
are asleep.

29:58.672 --> 30:02.508
Twenty-two NATO missiles fell
on the village of Bogutovac, near Kraljevo.

30:03.594 --> 30:07.513
Deadly cargo was dropped
on the residential part of the village.

30:07.598 --> 30:11.267
We're striking hard
at Serbia's machinery of repression

30:11.351 --> 30:15.188
while making a deliberate effort
to minimize harm to innocent people.

30:15.272 --> 30:19.442
On the hit list were
a local hospital and primary school.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.322
We all know
there has been a terrible shooting

30:24.406 --> 30:26.699
at a high school in Littleton, Colorado.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.035
I hope the American people

30:29.119 --> 30:32.580
will be praying for the students,
the parents, and the teachers.

30:32.664 --> 30:37.210
And, uh, we'll wait for events to unfold
and then there'll be more to say.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.545
Jefferson County 911.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.047
There's something going on
at Columbine High School.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.340
Someone's shooting a gun.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.799
-Do you know if anybody's injured?
-Yes.

30:43.884 --> 30:47.553
They've got pipe bombs, Uzi's,
you name it, buddy.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.138
- You're shitting me.
- I'm not.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.184
- A student hit in the spine at Columbine.
- We've got another kid on line.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.269
-Shot in the head.
-He's shot in the head?

30:55.354 --> 30:58.231
- Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
- We have automatic weapons. Okay?

30:58.315 --> 30:59.982
- Yes.
-All right.

31:00.067 --> 31:02.276
Can you guys send
lots and lots of paramedics?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.363
- So, are you still under an attack?
- Yes. The school is still under attack.

31:05.447 --> 31:09.408
We got a couple kids out in the hall
that are shot, so they're trying to get to them.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.411
Do not let anybody else in
until we tell them.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.706
- Jefferson County 911.
- Hi, it's Izzy Povich at NBC News.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.542
- Yes?
-We're calling about the school shooting.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.294
We're on the air live right now on MSNBC.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.755
Can you – I mean, can I –
Is that something you could just –

31:22.839 --> 31:26.050
Literally, I could patch you through
and you could tell us on the air.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.386
Literally, I could put you through now.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.971
- I understand that.

31:30.055 --> 31:33.474
Now they said he's gone
to the library. He's in the building.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.518
Gone to the library.
He's in the building.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.520
Hi. This is Stephanie Phillips
from Dateline. How you doing?

31:37.604 --> 31:39.105
- Good. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.856
- I love your show.
- I'm so glad.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.150
- Thank you.
- I watch it every night.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.443
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

31:44.528 --> 31:48.155
- Jefferson County 911.
- I am a teacher at Columbine High School.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.576
There is a student here with a gun.
He has shot out a window.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.286
Has anybody been injured, ma'am?

31:53.370 --> 31:56.789
Yes! Yes!
And the school is in a panic.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.209
I am in the library.
I've got students down –

32:00.294 --> 32:02.128
Under the tables, kids!

32:02.212 --> 32:03.588
Heads under the tables!

32:03.672 --> 32:06.090
I saw a student outside.
I was on hall d– Dear God!

32:06.174 --> 32:09.885
Okay, I was on hall duty. I saw a gun.
I said, "What's going on out there?"

32:09.970 --> 32:12.638
And he turned the gun
straight at us and shot.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.181
My God, the window went out.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.892
And the kid standing there with me,
I think he got hit.

32:16.977 --> 32:19.395
- We've got help on the way, ma'am. Okay?
- Okay – God!

32:19.479 --> 32:21.397
- Stay on the line with me.
- God.

32:24.818 --> 32:28.404
He's shooting in the library right now.
He's firing shots from the library.

32:28.488 --> 32:32.074
-He's firing shots in the library.
-Coming our way. Do we need to leave?

32:32.159 --> 32:33.826
Okay, hold on there.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.912
They just shot shots inside the cafeter –

32:36.997 --> 32:38.956
I may have to try and get out of here
and call you back.

32:39.041 --> 32:39.999
Okay.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.501
I called in before,
trying to find out where I'm supposed to go,

32:42.586 --> 32:44.462
and they put me on hold for frickin' ever.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.922
- Hi, it's Wendy at CNN still.
- Hi, Wendy.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.467
We're just taking names and numbers
right now from the press.

32:49.551 --> 32:52.136
- 'Cause Fox has somebody on now.
- Huh?

32:52.220 --> 32:54.180
- Fox has somebody from your office –
- I know.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.849
We've talked to a whole bunch of people
and we can only do so many

32:56.933 --> 32:58.934
because we've got
so many more calls coming in.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.228
I gotta get to my daughter at Columbine.
I've been trying for an hour.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.856
- I can't get anywhere near there.
- Sir?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.608
Okay, calm down. Okay?

33:05.692 --> 33:09.737
I think we're entitled to the information,
as parents, on where our children are!

33:09.821 --> 33:11.739
We have a lot of units
out there right now.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.993
I can't get anywhere near it. I want to find out
how to get in touch with my daughter.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.079
How do I get information on my daughter?

33:18.163 --> 33:21.207
I don't have any of that
information right now. I do have –

33:21.291 --> 33:23.125
Why in the hell not?
It's been over an hour.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.627
My son is Eric Harris,

33:24.711 --> 33:28.255
and I'm afraid that he might be involved
in the shooting at Columbine High School.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.924
Involved how?

33:30.008 --> 33:33.302
He's a member of what
they're calling "The Trench Coat Mafia."

33:33.387 --> 33:35.513
- Have you spoke with your son today?
-No, I haven't.

33:35.597 --> 33:39.642
- Have they picked up anybody yet?
-They're still looking for suspects.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.061
Your son is with who? Wh-What gang?

33:42.145 --> 33:44.605
Well, they're calling them
"The Trench Coat Mafia."

33:44.690 --> 33:46.607
I just heard that term on TV.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.194
Stay low, because if you try
to leave, I don't want you to get shot.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.530
Stay very low and quiet.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.448
Stay low and quiet.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.870
Be very quiet.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.762
When the shooting was over,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold

34:16.847 --> 34:19.514
had killed 12 students and one teacher.

34:20.559 --> 34:25.146
Dozens of others were wounded by
the over 900 rounds of ammo that were fired.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.399
It is believed that the guns that they used
were all legally purchased

34:28.483 --> 34:30.818
at stores and gun shows,

34:30.902 --> 34:34.989
and many of the bullets were bought
at the Littleton Kmart just down the street.

34:35.072 --> 34:39.409
Harris' diary also detailed ideas
about hijacking an airplane

34:39.494 --> 34:41.620
and crashing it into New York City.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.956
Some may characterize that as fantasy.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.668
In the end,
they turned the guns on themselves.

34:49.545 --> 34:54.049
And then he came into the library
and shot everybody around me

34:54.134 --> 34:58.512
and put a gun to my head
and asked if we all wanted to die.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.182
We started hearing shots in the hall,

35:01.266 --> 35:03.893
and then they came in
and they all told us to get under the desks,

35:03.977 --> 35:06.187
and we all got under the desks –

35:06.271 --> 35:10.024
And then they just started
coming in the library and opening fire.

35:10.108 --> 35:14.320
I just started screaming and crying
and telling him not to shoot me.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.864
And so he shot the girl ins –

35:16.948 --> 35:19.241
He shot her in the head in front of me.

35:19.326 --> 35:22.536
And he shot the black kid
because he was black.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.334
I have only five words for you –

35:28.418 --> 35:31.086
"From my cold, dead hands!"

35:33.965 --> 35:36.717
Just ten days
after the Columbine killings,

35:36.802 --> 35:39.887
despite the pleas
of a community in mourning,

35:39.971 --> 35:41.639
Charlton Heston came to Denver

35:41.723 --> 35:46.685
and held a large, pro-gun rally
for the National Rifle Association.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.189
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.982
Thank you all for coming,

35:52.067 --> 35:54.527
and thank you
for supporting your organization.

35:55.862 --> 35:59.698
I also want to applaud your courage
in coming here today.

35:59.783 --> 36:03.202
I have a message from the mayor,

36:03.286 --> 36:05.496
Mr. Wellington Webb, the mayor of Denver.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.415
--No, no, no, no.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.502
He sent me this...

36:13.046 --> 36:16.715
and it says, "Don't come here.
We don't want you here."

36:17.676 --> 36:20.803
I say to the mayor, this is our country.

36:20.887 --> 36:25.558
As Americans, we're free to travel
wherever we want in our broad land.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.820
"Don't come here"?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.906
- We're already here!

36:46.788 --> 36:48.414
I am here today...

36:49.791 --> 36:53.127
because my son, Daniel,
would want me to be here today.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.932
If my son, Daniel,
was not one of the victims...

37:07.934 --> 37:10.352
he would be here with me today.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.192
Something is wrong in this country...

37:19.279 --> 37:20.779
when a child...

37:21.990 --> 37:25.492
can grab a gun – grab a gun so easily...

37:26.578 --> 37:28.120
and shoot a bullet...

37:32.125 --> 37:34.960
into the middle of a child's face,

37:35.045 --> 37:37.046
as my son experienced.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.549
Something is wrong.

37:40.634 --> 37:44.678
But the time has come
to come to understand that

37:44.763 --> 37:49.433
a Tec-9, semi-automatic, 30-bullet weapon

37:49.517 --> 37:51.602
like that that killed my son,

37:52.437 --> 37:54.605
is not used to kill deer.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.524
It has no useful purpose.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.111
It is time to address this problem.

38:04.658 --> 38:07.618
We have work to do, hearts to heal,

38:07.702 --> 38:10.788
evil to defeat, and a country to unite.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.957
We may have differences, yes,

38:13.041 --> 38:17.044
and we will again suffer tragedy
almost beyond description.

38:17.128 --> 38:21.757
But when the sun sets on Denver
tonight and forevermore,

38:21.841 --> 38:25.302
let it always set on "We, the people,"

38:25.387 --> 38:29.306
secure in our land of the free
and home of the brave.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.268
I, for one, plan to do my part.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.771
- Thank you.

38:38.024 --> 38:38.190
When they had their convention in Colorado
a week or a month after Columbine –

38:38.191 --> 38:41.777
When they had their convention in Colorado
a week or a month after Columbine –

38:41.861 --> 38:44.321
-The NRA.
-Yeah. That was just stupid.

38:44.406 --> 38:47.866
Just don't do that. Of course you have
the right to. But what are you doing?

38:47.951 --> 38:50.744
That's just upsetting a whole city
full of people. Why would you do that?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.997
This is Matt Stone.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.792
He grew up in Littleton
and has fond memories of Columbine.

38:56.876 --> 39:01.088
But, yeah, Columbine is a crappy school
in the middle of a bunch of crappy houses.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.590
Matt and his friend Trey Parker

39:03.675 --> 39:08.012
found a way to take out their anger
of being different in Littleton

39:08.096 --> 39:11.932
and turn it not into carnage,
but into a cartoon.

Columbine is a normal high school
in a normal suburb, basically.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.382
Yeah. Painfully, painfully, painfully normal.

39:45.467 --> 39:48.469
Just absolutely, painfully,
horribly average. You know?

39:48.553 --> 39:50.929
Littleton in general is.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.723
I remember being in sixth grade,

39:52.807 --> 39:59.229
and I had to take the math test
to get into honors math in seventh grade.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.981
And they were like, "Don't screw this up,

40:01.066 --> 40:03.442
because if you screw this up, you won't
get into honors math in seventh grade.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.695
And if you don't get in in seventh grade,
you won't get in in eighth grade.

40:06.780 --> 40:10.657
And then not in ninth, tenth or 11th grade,
and you'll die poor and lonely."

40:10.742 --> 40:12.951
And that's it.
You know what I mean? It's, like –

40:13.036 --> 40:17.122
You know, you believe in high school
and a lot of its kids,

40:17.207 --> 40:20.793
but the teachers and counselors
and principals don't help things.

40:20.877 --> 40:25.672
They scare you into doing –
into conforming and doing good in school

40:25.757 --> 40:29.176
by saying, "If you're a loser now,
you're gonna be a loser forever."

40:29.260 --> 40:32.096
So with Eric and Dylan, right,
people called them "fag."

40:32.180 --> 40:34.848
They were like,
"If I'm a fag now, I'm a fag forever."

40:34.933 --> 40:37.851
And you wish someone
just could've grabbed them and gone,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.062
"Dude, high school's not the end of –"

40:40.146 --> 40:42.189
A year and a half?
Or a year, was it? I don't know.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.317
-No, no. A year –
-You can move out, cut your hair.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.320
-They were weeks from graduation.
-Yeah. You're done.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.115
It's amazing how fast
you lose touch with all those people.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.326
They just beat it in your head,
as early as sixth grade.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.661
Right.

40:55.745 --> 40:58.664
Don't fuck up, because if you do,
you're gonna die poor and lonely.

40:58.748 --> 41:01.708
And you're like, "Well, fuck,
whatever I am now I'm that forever."

41:01.793 --> 41:03.252
And of course it's completely opposite.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.629
All the dorks in high school
go on to do great things,

41:05.713 --> 41:09.925
and all the really cool guys are living
back in Littleton as insurance agents.

41:10.009 --> 41:13.262
Almost person to person,
it's completely that way.

41:13.346 --> 41:17.724
If someone told them that, maybe
they wouldn't have done it. But-- Yeah.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.351
I guess we'll never know why they did it.

41:19.435 --> 41:24.606
But one thing adults should never forget –
It still sucks being a teenager.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.900
And it really sucks going to school.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.902
What's your view on high school?

41:28.987 --> 41:32.281
I love it. I learn.

41:32.365 --> 41:35.242
I get picked on by bastards who hate me,

41:35.326 --> 41:37.578
and the principal's a dick.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.330
All right. What causes school violence?

41:40.415 --> 41:42.207
Him.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.500
-Him?
-Yeah.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.337
Yes, and after Columbine,

41:47.422 --> 41:51.175
it really sucked
being a student in America.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.635
Since last spring's
shooting at Columbine High,

41:53.720 --> 41:57.306
schools nationwide
have extended zero tolerance policies,

41:57.390 --> 42:01.810
suspending and expelling students
for all kinds of behavior considered unruly

42:01.895 --> 42:04.605
or warning signs of violence to come.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.816
This second-grader in Illinois
was suspended for ten days

42:07.901 --> 42:09.651
for bringing a nail clipper to class.

42:09.736 --> 42:11.486
That's a weapon, his school said.

42:11.571 --> 42:13.697
An elementary school
suspended a first-grader

42:13.781 --> 42:16.909
for pointing a chicken strip
at a teacher in the cafeteria.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.995
The eight-year-old was fooling around
with a friend at lunch last week

42:20.079 --> 42:24.166
when he pointed a breaded chicken finger
at a teacher and then said, "Pow, pow."

42:24.250 --> 42:27.294
He pointed a folded piece
of paper like this one, shaped like a gun,

42:27.378 --> 42:31.173
and told his classmates he was going to kill them
during a game of cops and robbers.

42:31.257 --> 42:34.176
If this isn't a warning sign,
then what is it?

42:34.260 --> 42:35.969
This Virginia high school student

42:36.054 --> 42:37.554
spent a month out of classes,

42:37.639 --> 42:40.307
originally sent home
for dyeing his hair blue.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.184
A high school honor student from Michigan

42:42.268 --> 42:44.686
could be expelled later today
at a school board hearing.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.647
Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Hicks

42:46.731 --> 42:50.150
wore a Scottish bagpiper's outfit
to his junior prom

42:50.235 --> 42:53.403
that included a plaid kilt,
a feathered hat,

42:53.488 --> 42:56.531
and a traditional knife
known as a Sgian Dubh.

42:56.616 --> 42:59.076
This T-shirt
landed a high school student in court.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.370
She wanted to start an anarchy club.

43:01.454 --> 43:05.207
The little time bombs that are
out there ticking, waiting to go off.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.292
And there are many of them
in every community.

43:07.377 --> 43:09.711
Students in at least seven different states

43:09.796 --> 43:11.713
have been suspended or arrested

43:11.798 --> 43:14.549
for talking about
or planning plots of their own.

43:14.634 --> 43:16.969
It's almost like guerrilla warfare.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.137
You don't know from which direction

43:19.222 --> 43:21.556
the enemy will be coming.

43:21.641 --> 43:25.102
Having a well-conceived
and strictly enforced dress code

43:25.186 --> 43:27.771
can dramatically improve
the safety of a school

43:27.855 --> 43:30.983
and can ensure a positive learning
environment for everyone.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.610
As this student's appearance demonstrates,

43:33.695 --> 43:35.904
having a lax policy about dress

43:35.989 --> 43:38.824
makes it easy for a student
to conceal a weapon

43:38.908 --> 43:42.577
and makes it difficult
to identify intruders on campus.

43:42.662 --> 43:45.497
A dress code
can reduce weapons violations,

43:45.581 --> 43:49.960
relieve tensions between gangs,
reduce disciplinary infractions,

43:50.044 --> 43:53.171
and generally improve
the atmosphere of the school.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.425
Our policy requires
that students tuck in their shirts,

43:56.509 --> 43:59.303
making the belt line visible at all times.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.763
Our students may not wear baggy pants

44:01.848 --> 44:06.810
or colors and insignias that are
commonly associated with gang activity.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.396
This policy was a collaborative effort.

44:09.480 --> 44:09.521
Yes, our children
were indeed something to fear.

44:09.522 --> 44:12.858
Yes, our children
were indeed something to fear.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.571
They had turned into little monsters.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.198
But who was to blame?

44:20.283 --> 44:22.242
All the experts had an answer.

44:22.327 --> 44:25.954
Angry, heavy metal subculture.

44:26.039 --> 44:26.955
Where were the parents?

44:27.040 --> 44:28.457
Violent movies.

44:28.541 --> 44:30.334
-South Park.
-Video games.

44:30.418 --> 44:31.835
-Television.
-Entertainment.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.086
-Satan.
-Cartoons.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.004
-Doom.
-Society.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.005
-Toy guns.
-Drugs.

44:35.089 --> 44:37.632
Shock rocker Marilyn Manson.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.134
-Marilyn Manson.
-Marilyn Manson.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.677
-Marilyn Manson.
-Marilyn Manson.

44:40.762 --> 44:44.639
Marilyn Manson has canceled
the last five dates of his US tour

44:44.724 --> 44:47.184
out of respect for those lost in Littleton.

44:47.268 --> 44:51.480
But the singer says artists like himself
are not the ones to blame.

44:51.564 --> 44:54.024
This is perhaps the sickest group

44:54.108 --> 44:58.153
ever promoted
by a mainstream record company.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.364
♪ I'm not a slave ♪

45:00.448 --> 45:04.868
♪ To a God that doesn't exist ♪

45:04.952 --> 45:09.247
After Columbine it seemed
the entire focus on why the shootings occurred

45:09.332 --> 45:12.501
was because the killers
listened to Marilyn Manson.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.420
Two years after Columbine,

45:15.505 --> 45:17.464
Manson finally returned to Denver.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.299
The Ozzfest at Mile High Stadium

45:19.384 --> 45:21.760
brings shock rocker Marilyn Manson
to Denver tomorrow.

45:21.844 --> 45:25.180
There were protests
from the religious right.

45:25.264 --> 45:28.558
But I thought I'd go
and talk with him myself.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.436
When I was a kid growing up,
music was the escape.

45:31.521 --> 45:35.023
That's the only thing
that had no judgments.

45:35.108 --> 45:39.319
You can put on a record and it's not gonna
yell at you for dressing the way you do.

45:39.404 --> 45:41.696
It's going to make you
feel better about it.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.991
Some will be so brash to ask

45:45.076 --> 45:47.536
if we believe that all
who hear Manson tomorrow night

45:47.620 --> 45:49.871
will go out and commit violent acts.

45:49.956 --> 45:52.082
The answer is no.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.668
But does everybody who watches a Lexus ad

45:54.752 --> 45:56.461
go and buy a Lexus?

45:56.546 --> 45:58.213
No, but a few do.

45:58.297 --> 46:02.259
I definitely can see
why they would pick me,

46:02.343 --> 46:05.637
because I think it's easy
to throw my face on a TV.

46:05.721 --> 46:10.559
Because I'm, in the end,
sort of a poster boy for fear

46:10.643 --> 46:13.437
because I represent
what everyone's afraid of.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.730
Because I do and say what I want.

46:15.815 --> 46:18.400
If Marilyn Manson can walk into our town

46:18.484 --> 46:21.570
and promote hate, violence,
suicide, death,

46:21.654 --> 46:24.072
drug use and Columbine-like behavior,

46:24.157 --> 46:27.242
I can say,
"Not without a fight you can't."

46:27.326 --> 46:31.705
The two by-products
of that whole tragedy were,

46:32.457 --> 46:35.834
uh, violence in entertainment
and gun control.

46:35.918 --> 46:38.628
And how perfect that that was the two things

46:38.713 --> 46:41.256
that we were gonna talk about
with the upcoming election.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.592
And also then
we forgot about Monica Lewinsky,

46:43.676 --> 46:48.513
and we forgot about the president
was shooting bombs overseas.

46:48.598 --> 46:50.891
Yet I'm a bad guy

46:50.975 --> 46:54.102
because I sing some rock and roll songs.

46:54.187 --> 46:56.980
And who's a bigger influence,
the president or Marilyn Manson?

46:57.064 --> 46:59.858
I'd like to think me,
but I'm gonna go with the president.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.068
Do you know that
the day Columbine happened,

47:02.153 --> 47:04.696
the United States
dropped more bombs on Kosovo

47:04.780 --> 47:06.698
than at any other time during that war?

47:06.782 --> 47:11.036
I do know that, and I think
that's really ironic that nobody said,

47:11.120 --> 47:14.873
"Well, maybe the president had
an influence on this violent behavior."

47:14.957 --> 47:19.419
That's not the way the media wants to take it
and spin it and turn it into fear.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.421
'Cause then you're watching television,

47:21.506 --> 47:24.716
you're watching the news,
you're being pumped full of fear.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.594
There's floods, there's AIDS,
there's murder.

47:27.678 --> 47:31.306
Cut to commercial,
buy the Acura, buy the Colgate.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.850
If you have bad breath,
they're not gonna talk to you.

47:33.935 --> 47:36.937
If you got pimples,
the girl's not gonna fuck you.

47:37.021 --> 47:41.316
And it's just this –
It's a campaign of fear and consumption.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.569
And that's what I think it's all based on,
the whole idea that,

47:44.654 --> 47:47.572
keep everyone afraid and they'll consume.

47:47.657 --> 47:49.241
Mm-hmm. Right.

47:49.325 --> 47:51.618
That's really as simple
as it can be boiled down to.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.496
If you were to talk directly
to the kids at Columbine

47:54.580 --> 47:56.039
or the people in that community,

47:56.123 --> 47:58.458
what would you say to them
if they were here right now?

47:58.543 --> 48:01.753
I wouldn't say a single word to them.
I would listen to what they have to say.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.588
And that's what no one did.

48:05.299 --> 48:08.426
-I'm Nicole Schlieve.
-And I'm Amanda Lamontagne.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.053
-And you went to Columbine?
-Yes.

48:10.137 --> 48:13.640
- huh. And you were with Eric and Dylan
in their class?

48:13.724 --> 48:15.559
Yeah, we were in their bowling class.

48:15.643 --> 48:17.394
-You were in their bowling class?
-Yeah.

48:17.478 --> 48:19.020
What's bowling class?

48:19.105 --> 48:23.567
Um, it's just an elective
you can take for a gym credit.

48:23.651 --> 48:26.570
- Where is the educational value of this?

48:26.654 --> 48:29.739
Um... I guess there isn't really any.

48:29.824 --> 48:31.491
No. There's not.

48:31.576 --> 48:32.951
--Is there any –

48:33.035 --> 48:36.162
I learned how to bowl a lot better,
that's for sure.

48:36.247 --> 48:38.373
What were Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold like?

48:38.457 --> 48:40.625
-Weird.
-Yeah?

48:40.710 --> 48:44.504
-I mean, not very social.
-I didn't really know who they were. Yeah.

48:44.589 --> 48:47.299
Not very social.
Just kinda kept to themselves.

48:48.134 --> 48:50.510
How good bowlers were Eric and Dylan?

48:51.679 --> 48:55.599
When we played them, all I remember is
they were just, like, crazy.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.143
-They would just, like, chuck the ball.
-Chuck it down there.

48:58.227 --> 49:01.396
Throw the ball down there.
Didn't care too much about how they bowled.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.231
They didn't really care
about their scores.

49:03.316 --> 49:04.399
What were the suspects doing

49:04.483 --> 49:05.984
the morning of attack?

49:06.068 --> 49:07.569
I heard that they were bowling.

49:07.653 --> 49:08.945
That's the only thing I'm aware of.

49:10.489 --> 49:13.199
So did Dylan and Eric show up
that morning and bowl two games

49:13.284 --> 49:16.244
before moving on to shoot up the school?

49:16.329 --> 49:18.622
And did they just chuck the balls
down the lane?

49:18.706 --> 49:20.582
Did this mean something?

49:20.666 --> 49:24.669
Um, well, I guess they went
to their favorite class.

49:24.754 --> 49:26.671
Why wasn't anyone blaming bowling

49:26.756 --> 49:31.426
for warping the minds of Eric and Dylan
to commit their evil deeds?

49:31.510 --> 49:34.971
Was it not just as plausible
as blaming Marilyn Manson?

49:36.390 --> 49:40.101
After all, it was apparently the last thing
they did before the massacre.

49:41.896 --> 49:46.107
But wait a minute. There's lots of bowling
going on in other countries.

49:47.902 --> 49:50.320
And don't they listen
to Marilyn Manson in Germany,

49:50.404 --> 49:52.864
the home of sinister Goth music?

49:52.948 --> 49:54.282
Some Gothic festival.

49:55.785 --> 49:58.703
Don't they watch
the same violent movies in France?

49:58.788 --> 49:59.287
No.

50:03.376 --> 50:06.503
Most of the violent video games
are from Japan.

50:07.963 --> 50:11.257
Many people in America believe
that it's the breakup of the family unit

50:11.342 --> 50:14.010
that's caused so many wayward youth
to turn to violence.

50:14.095 --> 50:16.554
I'll save you the trouble.
I'll run away and kill myself.

50:16.639 --> 50:19.683
How would you like that?
You can't keep me here!

50:19.767 --> 50:22.811
But statistics show that there are
more broken homes and divorce

50:22.895 --> 50:24.688
in Great Britain than in the US.

50:24.772 --> 50:27.774
It's official.
Fergie's marriage has ended.

50:28.609 --> 50:31.319
Liberals contend that
it's all the poverty we have in America

50:31.404 --> 50:33.446
that causes all this violence.

50:34.281 --> 50:37.826
But the unemployment rate in Canada
is twice what it is here.

50:37.910 --> 50:41.454
Of course most people say it's because
we Americans have a violent history,

50:41.539 --> 50:43.707
a violent past.

50:43.791 --> 50:46.876
Cowboys and Indians, the Wild West,

50:46.961 --> 50:49.421
a history of conquering and bloodshed.

50:49.505 --> 50:52.507
Well, if that's all it takes
to end up with such a violent society

50:52.591 --> 50:54.134
like we have in America,

50:54.218 --> 50:55.969
how do you explain this?

51:17.616 --> 51:22.078
Yet in spite of all of this, how many people
are killed by guns each year?

51:22.163 --> 51:24.622
In Germany, 381.

51:26.959 --> 51:29.586
In France, 255.

51:31.630 --> 51:34.924
In Canada, 165.

51:35.968 --> 51:39.012
In the United Kingdom, 68.

51:42.141 --> 51:44.976
In Australia, 65.

51:45.519 --> 51:48.438
In Japan, 39.

51:50.232 --> 51:52.025
In the United States,

51:52.109 --> 51:55.779
11, 127.

51:56.781 --> 52:00.116
But that – But that, to me,
brings up an important question.

52:00.201 --> 52:02.827
Then what is so different about Americans?

52:04.038 --> 52:06.372
Are we homicidal in nature?

52:06.457 --> 52:09.501
Because in Europe and Australia...

52:10.586 --> 52:13.046
most other free world countries,
they don't have this.

52:13.130 --> 52:16.424
They don't have people who snap
and go on murderous rampages.

52:16.509 --> 52:17.717
No, they're just like us.

52:17.802 --> 52:21.346
I mean, they have the occasional person
that snaps and kills a lot of people.

52:21.430 --> 52:23.932
How about a British soccer riot?
Those aren't Quakers there.

52:24.016 --> 52:28.019
Every time that I bring up comparisons
with other free world countries,

52:28.103 --> 52:30.605
what I hear is, "Our culture
is so different. We're so different."

52:30.689 --> 52:33.233
And as you said,
they have violent video games,

52:33.317 --> 52:35.944
they have violent movies,
they have alienated youth.

52:36.028 --> 52:40.114
They, like us,
don't have prayer in schools.

52:40.866 --> 52:44.369
What is so radically different?
What is it about us?

52:44.453 --> 52:45.745
-What is it?
-What is it?

52:45.830 --> 52:47.080
-What is it?
-What is it?

52:48.582 --> 52:50.333
I don't know.

52:52.294 --> 52:55.630
Now it's time for a brief history
of the United States of America.

52:55.714 --> 52:57.757
Hi, boys and girls. Ready to get started?

52:57.842 --> 53:00.760
Once upon a time, there were
these people in Europe called Pilgrims,

53:00.845 --> 53:02.554
and they were afraid of being persecuted.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.684
So they all got in a boat
and sailed to the New World

53:07.768 --> 53:09.352
where they wouldn't
have to be scared ever again.

53:09.436 --> 53:12.313
- I'm so relaxed.
- I feel so much safer.

53:12.398 --> 53:14.482
But as soon as they arrived
they were greeted by savages,

53:14.567 --> 53:16.276
and they got scared all over again.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.778
-Injuns!
-So they killed them all.

53:18.863 --> 53:21.281
Now, you'd think wiping out a race of people
would calm them down.

53:21.365 --> 53:24.617
But, no! Instead, they started
getting frightened of each other.

53:24.702 --> 53:25.577
-Witch!
-Witch!

53:25.661 --> 53:27.328
So they burned witches.

53:27.413 --> 53:31.332
In 1775, they started killing the British
so they could be free.

53:31.417 --> 53:34.210
And it worked,
but they still didn't feel safe.

53:34.295 --> 53:35.837
So they passed a second amendment

53:35.921 --> 53:37.422
which said every white man
could keep his gun.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.716
I loves my gun. Loves my gun.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.635
Which brings us
to the genius idea of slavery!

53:42.720 --> 53:46.222
You see, boys and girls, white people back then
were also afraid of doing any work.

53:46.307 --> 53:48.766
So they went to Africa,
kidnapped thousands of black people,

53:48.851 --> 53:52.312
brought them back to America
and forced them to work very hard for no money.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.648
-And I don't mean "no money" like –
-I work at Walmart and make no money.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.234
I mean zero dollars. Nothing! Nada! Zip!

53:58.319 --> 54:01.779
Doing it that way made the USA
the richest country in the world.

54:01.864 --> 54:05.033
So did having all that money and free help
calm the white people down?

54:05.117 --> 54:06.951
No way. They got even more afraid.

54:07.036 --> 54:09.329
That's because after 200 years of slavery,

54:09.413 --> 54:11.873
the black people outnumbered the white people
in many parts of the South.

54:11.957 --> 54:14.459
Well, you can pretty much guess
what came next.

54:14.543 --> 54:16.252
The slaves started rebelling,
there were uprisings,

54:16.337 --> 54:18.087
and ol' Master's head got chopped off!

54:18.172 --> 54:21.090
And when white people heard of this,
they were freakin' out and going –

54:21.175 --> 54:23.843
I want to live!
Don't kill me, big black man!

54:23.928 --> 54:26.930
Well, just in the nick of time
came Samuel Colt

54:27.014 --> 54:29.682
who, in 1836,
invented the first weapon ever

54:29.767 --> 54:32.268
that could be fired over and over
without having to reload.

54:32.353 --> 54:35.063
And all the Southern whites
were like, "Yee-haw!"

54:35.147 --> 54:36.606
But it was too late.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.025
The North soon won the Civil War
and the slaves were freed.

54:39.109 --> 54:42.111
Yep, they were free now to go
chop all the ol' masters' heads off.

54:42.196 --> 54:45.365
- And everybody was like –
- No! We're gonna die!

54:45.449 --> 54:49.243
But the freed slaves took no revenge.
They just wanted to live in peace.

54:49.328 --> 54:52.330
But you couldn't convince
the white people of this.

54:52.414 --> 54:54.749
So they formed the Ku Klux Klan.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.334
And in 1871,

54:56.418 --> 54:59.420
the same year the Klan became
an illegal terrorist organization,

54:59.505 --> 55:03.257
another group was founded –
the National Rifle Association.

55:03.342 --> 55:05.426
Soon politicians passed
one of the first gun laws,

55:05.511 --> 55:08.638
making it illegal for any black person
to own one.

55:08.722 --> 55:11.975
It was a great year for America –
the KKK and the NRA!

55:12.059 --> 55:15.186
Of course they had nothing to do with each other
and this was just a coincidence.

55:15.270 --> 55:17.397
One group legally promoted
responsible gun ownership

55:17.481 --> 55:19.774
and the other group shot
and lynched black people.

55:19.858 --> 55:22.276
And that's the way it was
all the way to 1955,

55:22.361 --> 55:25.822
when a black woman broke the law
by refusing to move to the back of the bus.

55:25.906 --> 55:27.615
White people just couldn't believe it.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.826
-Why won't she move?
-What's going on?

55:29.910 --> 55:31.369
Man, all hell broke loose!

55:31.453 --> 55:33.621
Black people everywhere
started demanding their rights,

55:33.706 --> 55:36.207
and white people had
a major freaky fear meltdown.

55:36.291 --> 55:39.085
-And they were all like –
-Run away, run away!

55:39.169 --> 55:41.295
And they did –
they all ran, fleein' to the suburbs,

55:41.380 --> 55:43.715
where it was all white and safe and clean.

55:43.799 --> 55:46.175
And they went out and bought
a quarter of a billion guns

55:46.260 --> 55:48.761
and put locks on their doors,
alarms in their houses,

55:48.846 --> 55:50.596
and gates around the neighborhoods.

55:50.681 --> 55:54.559
And finally they were all safe and secure
and snug as a bug.

56:00.649 --> 56:03.735
And everyone lived happily ever after.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.783
Or did they?

56:14.913 --> 56:17.373
Because if you turn on the evening news,

56:17.458 --> 56:20.501
America still seems like
a pretty scary place.

56:20.586 --> 56:23.796
Who is he?
Is he dangerous? What's he up to?

56:23.881 --> 56:25.423
What are you trying to pull?

56:25.507 --> 56:27.091
Why are people scared?

56:27.176 --> 56:29.886
Remember all the Y2K scares?

56:29.970 --> 56:33.347
Weren't we told that our very society
was about to collapse

56:33.432 --> 56:37.060
because somebody forgot to type in
a couple of digits on the computer?

56:37.144 --> 56:39.479
There's gonna be mass chaos and confusion.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.564
Tonight, the countdown begins.

56:41.648 --> 56:46.152
All day, store director Rick Smith
watched consumers get Y2K-ready.

56:46.236 --> 56:50.239
Batteries sell extremely well,
the lamp oil, generators.

56:50.866 --> 56:52.492
After sending
the country into a panic,

56:52.576 --> 56:53.910
the clock struck midnight...

56:54.912 --> 56:57.580
- and nothing happened.

56:57.664 --> 57:01.959
Or how about those killer bees
that were going to attack America?

57:02.044 --> 57:03.711
We're almost certain they'll arrive this year.

57:03.796 --> 57:07.256
Schmidt expects
the Africanized bees to reach Texas this year,

57:07.341 --> 57:10.051
cross into Arizona
in about two to three years.

57:10.135 --> 57:13.179
He's concerned because the killer bee
is overly aggressive.

57:13.263 --> 57:15.807
They will follow you for half a mile.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.643
The bees never came.

57:19.603 --> 57:22.563
Remember the first time you heard
that someone had hidden a razor blade

57:22.648 --> 57:24.607
in an apple at Halloween?

57:24.691 --> 57:28.027
Before long, kids were not permitted
to go out in the dark on Halloween

57:28.112 --> 57:30.530
and go trick-or-treating
at strangers' homes.

57:30.614 --> 57:33.658
A lot of people say
they won't give out candy treats on Halloween.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.535
It's too dangerous and they're too scared.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.161
Well, guess what?

57:37.246 --> 57:40.206
There never was any razor blade
in the apple.

57:40.290 --> 57:44.585
In fact, only two kids in the past 40 years
have been killed by Halloween candy,

57:44.670 --> 57:47.463
and both of them were poisoned
on purpose by relatives.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.132
Bye!

57:49.216 --> 57:51.717
It was like a scene from a horror movie.

57:51.802 --> 57:55.972
This Hooksett man was mowing his lawn
when a fox darted out of the woods

57:56.056 --> 57:57.640
and attacked his riding mower.

57:57.724 --> 58:00.268
A warning about
a popular weight loss supplement.

58:00.352 --> 58:02.145
What you don't know may kill you.

58:02.229 --> 58:03.771
You ride them every day,

58:03.856 --> 58:07.650
but in an instant an escalator
can mangle you or a loved one.

58:07.734 --> 58:11.154
7 on Your Side reveals why you
may be riding a Stairway to Danger.

58:11.238 --> 58:14.615
You might want to take some extra
precautions. Keep a low profile.

58:14.700 --> 58:17.869
Don't go around dancing with
a bunch of Americans in the streets.

58:17.953 --> 58:20.580
Make sure that you don't
draw a lot of attention to yourself

58:20.664 --> 58:21.998
and the fact that you're an American.

58:22.082 --> 58:25.001
The nation's top doctor
says one in five Americans

58:25.085 --> 58:27.003
suffers some form of mental disorder.

58:27.087 --> 58:31.090
The Surgeon General, David Satcher,
pleads with people to seek help now.

58:31.175 --> 58:34.844
The media,
the corporations, the politicians

58:34.928 --> 58:39.056
have all done such a good job
of scaring the American public

58:39.141 --> 58:42.935
it's come to the point where they don't
need to give any reason at all.

58:44.146 --> 58:47.190
Today the Justice Department did issue a –

58:48.442 --> 58:49.984
a blanket alert.

58:52.654 --> 58:55.698
It was in recognition
of a general threat we received.

58:57.451 --> 59:00.828
This is not the first time
the Justice Department have acted like this.

59:01.830 --> 59:03.998
I hope it's the last.

59:04.082 --> 59:07.418
But given the attitude of the evildoers,
it may not be.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.885
I just love these boulevards down here though.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.179
You don't get this in most of LA.

59:19.264 --> 59:22.183
How come whenever I'm out here
I turn on the 11:00 news

59:22.267 --> 59:26.020
and I hear, "Tonight in South Central,
a drive-by shooting."

59:26.104 --> 59:29.523
Or "Tonight in South Central,"
um, this, that or whatever.

59:29.608 --> 59:31.234
-I mean –
-Right.

59:31.318 --> 59:33.694
I mean, they're not making that up,
are they?

59:33.779 --> 59:35.780
No, but they're choosing
what they're covering.

59:36.490 --> 59:39.200
If you turn on TV, on the news –

59:39.284 --> 59:40.660
Yeah?

59:40.744 --> 59:42.995
What are you gonna hear about?
Dangerous black guys, right?

59:43.080 --> 59:44.163
Mm-hmm.

59:44.248 --> 59:48.251
Unnamed black guy who's,
you know, accused of some crime, or –

59:48.335 --> 59:49.752
Right.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.504
You're gonna see pictures

59:51.588 --> 59:54.590
of black guys doing bad things and hearing
stories about black guys doing bad things.

59:54.675 --> 59:56.300
We've heard this our whole lives.

59:56.385 --> 59:59.095
The suspect is a black male in his 20s.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:03.182
We are told he has a large Afro, sideburns.
He was wearing a silver chain at the time.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.351
Police say the suspect is a black man,

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:09.939
6'1", 160 to 180 pounds,
about 35 years in age.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.733
The suspect is a black male, aged 16 to 18.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.318
The suspect is African-American.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:15.236
-Police believe –
-Police –

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.904
- Police say –
- ... a black man--

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:17.780
-Suspect –
-Suspect –

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:18.781
-Suspect –
-Suspect –

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.033
- The suspect is a black male.
- A black man –

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.410
-A black man.
-A black –

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:23.703
-Black male.
-Black man.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:24.745
A black man –

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:27.373
Susan Smith drowns her two children.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.543
- She tells people a black guy –
- Right.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.545
stole the car and stole the kids.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.131
And everyone, at first, bought it.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:38.175
Some guy jumped, at a red light, into her car

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.511
with her two kids in it, and he took off.

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.388
It's a black guy, she says.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.806
- Black male?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.726
And I told 'em I loved 'em.
And I hollered I loved them.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.978
And it's just a tragedy.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.522
The anonymous, urban,

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:54.692
which means, usually, black male

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:57.236
comes by and does this
is the excuse for all kinds of things.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.946
Charles Stuart, the lawyer in Boston.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.031
Right. Exactly.

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:02.325
Kills his pregnant wife,
says a black guy did it.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.492
Everybody buys it.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.662
The suspect described
as a black male about six feet tall.

01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:11.042
Chuck and Carol Stuart were robbed
at gunpoint as they left a Lamaze class.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.169
It seemed the ultimate urban nightmare.

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.172
You know, the thing I love
about this country of mine

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:20.843
is that whether you're a psychotic killer
or running for president of the United States,

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.429
the one thing you can always count on

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.515
is white America's fear of the black man.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.769
We've heard the stories
on the news and in the papers,

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.687
and they have killed people.

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:35.149
Killer bees, also known as Africanized bees.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.984
I'm scared. I'm really worried with them.

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:40.863
Rosemary Shibley never
expected a nest of Africanized killer bees

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.199
to shack up across the street from her.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:46.369
But I'm terribly allergic to them
and so are my grandkids.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.829
They're originally
from southern and eastern Africa.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:52.208
Dr. Warwick Kerr brought some to Brazil in 1956

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:56.295
and tried to mate them with the European bee,
the kind that we're used to.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.130
But they got loose, took over

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.508
and moved all the way
to the southern United States.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:04.261
The main difference between a traditional
honeybee and an Africanized bee

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:05.846
is the bees' aggressiveness.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:08.391
If I was to do this
to an Africanized bees' hive,

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:11.894
I could have several hundred stings
in a matter of minutes.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:15.439
Danny Self raises
the kinder, gentler, European bees,

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:16.774
and he's done the research.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:20.694
The only way that you can tell the two
of 'em is doing measurements on the body parts.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:23.322
Quite frankly, the black community
has become entertainment

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:26.325
for the rest of the community.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.451
Meaning what?

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:30.913
The entertainment being the crime of the day –

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.957
"If it bleeds, it leads" –

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.209
gets to be the front story,

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:40.506
and then that becomes the perception
and the image of an entire people,

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.176
which couldn't be further from the truth,
in my opinion.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.262
In fact, you'll find, I think,

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:50.474
most African-Americans
are quite adverse to gun possession.

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:54.061
In suburbia, I think there's some notion

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:57.106
that there's going to be an invading horde

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.860
come from either the city
or from someplace unknown

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:04.071
to savage their suburban community.

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:07.908
To me, not only is it bizarre,

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:11.120
but it's totally unfounded.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:14.081
And these pistols, curiously enough,

01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:16.750
weren't being taken off of kids
in the city of Flint,

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.962
but were being taken off of kids
out in the out-county area

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:23.257
in the suburban communities.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:26.010
-And –
-I didn't think that's what you were gonna say.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:29.472
I thought you were gonna say
it's all these black kids in inner city schools

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.056
that had these guns.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.559
No. That's –

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:38.147
We've never really had many problems
with guns in the city.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:41.066
Not to say we haven't. We've had some.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.860
But that's never been the biggest problem.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.571
The biggest problem
has been the gun possession

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:49.074
by these adolescents in suburbia.

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:52.536
- How'd you get a gun?
- I stole mine.

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.914
-Where'd you steal it from?
-I stole it from a friend of mine.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.916
-Where'd he get it?
-His dad owns a bunch of guns.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.294
-What were you doing with the stolen guns?
-We went down to Detroit to try to sell 'em.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.631
'Cause I can get a buck-fifty a pop
for a nine millimeter.

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.424
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:08.219
-Who were you trying to sell them to?
-Anybody that would really want 'em.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:10.596
Mostly gangs and stuff like that.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.181
-Gangs in the city of Detroit?
-Yeah.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:14.350
- Black?
- Predominantly.

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:15.809
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:18.938
-So now you're okay?
-Yeah, I'm free now. I'm completely clear.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.982
-You can keep selling guns?
-Well, I can't really keep selling guns.

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:24.527
It's getting too risky, man.
Everybody knows me up here.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.321
People want guns, or drugs, or alcohol,
they come to my house.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.866
-And that's just too much.
-Yeah, too much hassle.

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:35.913
My favorite statistic in all the research I did

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:39.875
discovered that the murder rate
had gone down by 20 percent.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.335
The coverage –

01:04:41.419 --> 01:04:45.047
that is, how many murders
are on the evening news –

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.258
went up by 600 percent.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:54.056
The American people are conditioned
by network TV, by local news,

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.183
to believe that their communities

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:58.978
are much more dangerous
than they actually are.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.272
For example, here in this community,

01:05:01.356 --> 01:05:04.984
crime has decreased every year
for the past eight years.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:09.238
Yet gun ownership, particularly
handgun ownership, is on the increase.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.449
Crime rates have been dropping,
dropping, dropping.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:15.452
Fear of crime has been going up, up, up.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.955
How can that be possible?
It doesn't make any sense.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:22.209
But it makes perfect sense when you see
what we're hearing from politicians

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.503
and seeing in the news media.

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:29.300
So we're right here on the corner
of Florence and Normandie.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:32.595
This was kind of ground zero for the LA riots.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.513
Right.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:38.017
If a couple of white guys go down
and walk around South Central,

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.476
they're gonna get killed,

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.395
which I can tell you is a common perception.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:46.150
The odds that something's going
to happen to us are really, really slight.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.985
-Minuscule.
-Right. Okay.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:51.822
But, you know, if you look up there,
you get a different symbol

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.490
of the Hollywood sign.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:56.577
It means something very different
than the corner of Florence and Normandie

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.621
for most Americans and most of the world.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.998
It means glamour and Hollywood,
except that we can't see it.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:03.917
I can't see the Hollywood sign.
Where is it?

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.337
You can't see it because of something

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:09.632
that's probably
much more dangerous for us right now,

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:11.342
which is the stuff we're breathing.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:14.136
The pollution that's blocking the Hollywood sign,
we're breathing this.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.932
That's far more dangerous than all the other stuff
the media's telling us to be afraid of.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:22.144
As we left the corner
of Florence and Normandie,

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:26.065
I noticed that a number of helicopters
had appeared in the sky.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:29.443
Within seconds,
the news media started to arrive.

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:32.488
- So what's the story here?
- I'm waiting. I thought you would know.

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.406
No, I don't know anything.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.951
A sergeant told me it's a guy with a gun,
but they're not sure.

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:39.912
-That's all they told me.
-All right.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.664
Since no action,
I'm not getting the camera down.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:44.249
I just happened to see the chopper.
We were going to another story.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.293
-What story you going to?
-It's a near drowning.

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:48.337
-It's a drowning?
-Near drowning.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.548
How about the story about how
you can't see the Hollywood Hills

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:53.717
because of the pollution?

01:06:53.802 --> 01:06:55.886
Could you maybe
do a story on that tonight?

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.931
Pollution. You probably could.
I probably could.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.016
You can't see it.
You can't see anything around here.

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:04.478
If you have to choose between a guy with a gun
and a near drowning of a baby,

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.355
and you can only be in one place
at one time –

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.107
-Go with the gun.
-You go with the gun always.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.483
-Go with the gun.
-Yeah.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.443
Is it all over here?

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.278
All over? All over?

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.114
-Not yet. Not yet.
-Looks like it.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:19.493
Just wait for these sergeants down here
to come down 'cause they got all the details.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.996
Okay. Hey, I was just wondering,
I just got here to LA today.

01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:26.834
I can't see the Hollywood sign
down on the hills there, down Normandie.

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:28.919
-I can't see the sign 'cause of the pollution.
-Right.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:33.048
Is there anybody you can go and arrest
for polluting up the air?

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:34.800
-Absolutely not.
-Nobody?

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.969
-No.
-Why's that?

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.681
Why is that, Sergeant?

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:47.354
He's fighting him.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:48.814
He's fighting him.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:54.027
For over a decade, there has been
one show on American television

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.572
that has consistently brought
black and white people together

01:07:56.656 --> 01:08:00.534
in an effort to reduce our fears
and celebrate our diversity.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.035
Get that hand back here.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.079
That show is Cops.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.335
I went to see a former producer of Cops

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.130
and executive producer
of World's Wildest Police Videos,

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:14.923
Mr. Dick Herlan.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:18.426
Look "liberal" up in the dictionary,
and my picture's in there somewhere.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.636
- Yeah.
- So then –

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:24.640
You know,
why not be compelled to do a show

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:28.604
that focuses on what's causing the crime,

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:31.023
as opposed to just
chasing the criminals down?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.649
Because I think
it's harder to do that show.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.944
I don't know what that show would be.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.988
Anger does well. Hate does well.
Violence does well.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.448
Tolerance and understanding

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:43.786
and trying to learn to be a little different
than you were last year does less well.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.453
- Does less well in the ratings.
- Yeah.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.290
Maybe because we,
in the television business,

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:52.836
because we tend to demonize
black and Hispanic people,

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:56.423
then those watching it at home are going,
"I don't want to help those people.

01:08:56.508 --> 01:08:58.884
I'm not going to do anything to help them
because I hate them now,

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.886
because they may hurt me."

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.720
You know what I'm saying?

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.808
I know what you're saying.
I'm not sure that's what we're doing.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:13.607
I'm not sure we're demonizing
black and Hispanic people particularly.

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:17.361
I don't think we show black
and Hispanic people as being criminals –

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:23.783
I'd like to say not more often,
but probably they are more often.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:29.456
But, um, we're certainly not trying to
demonize black and Hispanic people.

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.166
We show them on the news.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:35.002
We show them on TV as pretty scary people.

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.756
Yeah.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:41.801
And I agree. I'd like to see that
reversed as much as possible.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:44.179
I, um –

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:46.055
Start tonight.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.140
The thing is,
I don't know how to start tonight.

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:50.352
I don't know how to tell that story.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.270
If I was smart enough to do that –

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.107
-I'll pitch you one.
-Okay. All right.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.860
Um, do a show called –

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.362
Not Cops, but Corporate Cops.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.030
♪ Corporation man ♪

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.949
♪ Hey, corporate man ♪

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.618
♪ We're coming out to get you
Better run while you can ♪

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.329
♪ We're coming out to get you
Better run while you can ♪

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.707
I love the idea.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.960
I don't think it would make
very interesting reality TV

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:18.589
unless we can get those people
to get in their SUVs

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:21.800
and drive really fast down the road
away from the police.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:26.221
But I'm telling you, everyone in America
who's got your basic, everyday job

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.849
is gonna love watching the boss

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:30.934
being chased down the street
with his shirt off,

01:10:31.019 --> 01:10:32.477
thrown to the ground
and a knee to the neck.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.354
I'm telling you, that is gonna get ratings.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.983
I'm with you,
and if I can find a police outfit

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:42.404
that would prosecute corporate criminals
appropriately

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.031
and would go after them appropriately –

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:49.244
In other words, what you do to a man
who's just stolen a lady's purse with $85 to it,

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:53.457
then you need to do
an appropriate response to a man

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:57.002
who's just stolen $85 million
from indigent people.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.171
Then, boy,
we're gonna be out there filming that.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.465
But as a matter of fact,
when police go after the guy

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:03.550
who's just stolen $85 million,

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:05.636
they treat him like he was a member
of the city council,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.554
as he may or may not be,

01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:10.307
and it's not exciting television.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.478
If you could get that guy
to take his shirt off –

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:15.771
Right.

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:19.066
And throw his cellular phone at the police
as they come through the door,

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.110
try to jump out that window,
then we'd have a show.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.863
You watch violence on TV
in a place like Canada,

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.032
and you know it's not happening next door.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:30.953
You watch it here,
and you know it is happening next door.

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:33.246
-Right.
-I think that's –

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.958
I don't know what the difference is,
but there's a big difference.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.293
Why isn't it happening in Canada?

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:42.631
Why aren't there 10,000 murders a year?

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.008
I don't know,
but I want to go to Canada to retire

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.178
'cause it sounds like where we want to be.

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:51.014
I'd like to find out
what that difference is, wouldn't you?

01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:52.975
Yeah. I'm trying to find out.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.442
Where are you supposed to be now?

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:03.860
-School.
-School.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.570
School.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.406
Aren't you worried
about what you're not learning?

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:11.410
I'm mostly helping everybody else in the class.
Then I barely get to do my work, period.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.911
--How about you?

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:16.081
-You're not worried about your education?
-Well, I've got the textbook.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:20.127
Why do you think we have
so many gun murders in America?

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.462
I have no idea.

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:25.048
People must hate each other there
or something.

01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:26.925
You mean Canadians don't hate each other?

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:31.388
Well, we do, but we don't go to the point
of shooting somebody just to get revenge.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:35.100
-What do you do?
-I don't know. Tease them, maybe.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.269
-Make fun of them, ridicule them.
-Throw eggs at them.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.395
-Eggs.
-Eggs.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:41.273
How many gun murders in Sarnia this year?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.357
None.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:44.526
Last year?

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.653
I believe we had one at the time.

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:48.321
Year before that?

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.449
I can't recall what we had in the way of –

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.160
-Maybe one in the last three years?
-Probably. Yes.

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:56.163
-Mm-hmm.
-Very low. Very low for the city.

01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:57.247
Mm-hmm.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:01.251
Well, of course there's no murders here
because there's only 70,000 people

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.087
and it's "The Kissing Capital of the World."

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.590
So I went down the river
to another Canadian city

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:09.217
that was five times as large as Sarnia –

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:13.138
Windsor, Ontario,
just across the river from Detroit.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.016
I was sure there'd be
more murders in Windsor.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.852
Ever hear of anyone
being shot by a gun in Windsor?

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.188
No. No.

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:23.273
You remember any murders here?

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:26.860
There was one long time ago probably.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:29.154
- How long ago?
-–

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.240
-In your lifetime?
-In my lifetime.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:35.535
Probably about 15, 20 years ago,
there was one murder.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.788
In fact, this Windsor policeman told me

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:41.875
that the only gun murder he could recall
in Windsor in the last three years

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:44.461
was committed by a guy from Detroit

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:46.546
who had a stolen gun from Minnesota.

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:50.467
With nearly 400,000 people
in the Windsor area,

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:54.888
there were simply no Canadians
shooting other Canadians.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.643
I thought it might be time
for some fun facts about Canada.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.896
I hit the streets of New York to find out

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.858
what the average American thought
about our friendly neighbor to the north.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:11.655
Canadians don't watch as much
violent movies as Americans do.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.705
That's wrong. Hordes of young boys
all throughout Canada

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.375
eagerly await
the next Hollywood bloodbath.

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.711
- Then the guy gets his leg taken off.
- Wow.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.131
-And there was a lot of girls.
-Showing cleavage.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.715
-And naked.
-Yeah?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.509
-Naked at one point.
-I like that stuff.

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:35.679
-What movie did you guys see tonight?
-Sixth Day.

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:37.931
-Sixth Day with Arnold Schwarzenegger?
-Yeah.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:42.227
Did it make you want to come out here
and play this shoot-'em-up game?

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.063
Well, yeah.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:50.026
There's no poverty in Canada
like there is here in the States.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.278
Wrong again.

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:54.156
We've also had much higher unemployment rate.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.074
When Michigan was running at four percent,

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:57.993
we were still running at eight or nine percent.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.162
We had an institutional unemployment rate.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.539
I think there'd mostly be white people
in Canada.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.416
That's strange.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.586
'Cause when I'm in Canada,
I see black people everywhere.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.005
And yellow people and brown people.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:12.924
And 13 percent of the country is nonwhite.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:16.469
So the Canadians are pretty much just like us,

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:19.097
and the reason that they have so few murders

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:22.184
has to be because they've got so few guns.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.316
What kind of guns do you own?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.818
I hunt. I own rifles and shotguns.

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:33.778
-I own pistols.
-Mm-hmm.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.864
So how many guns total?

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.991
-Probably about seven.
-Seven guns?

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.118
-Do you have a gun?
-I have a few guns.

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:42.913
-Really? How many guns do you have?
-Half a dozen.

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:46.249
You could name how many people right now
that own guns that you know?

01:15:46.334 --> 01:15:49.252
-Two, three, a dozen?
-More than that.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:52.422
There's a tremendous amount of gun ownership,
being the nature of the country we are.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:54.299
We're a large country geographically.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.384
We grew up with hunting and fishing
being a tradition.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:59.304
In Canada, with a population
of just around about 30 million,

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.389
there's about ten million families,

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.851
and the best estimate is
somewhere in the region of seven million guns.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:11.608
Wow. Canada was one gun-loving,
gun-toting, gun-crazy country.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:16.154
-Where can I get a gun?
-I can buy a gun uptown anytime I want to.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:19.991
I see you're a Glock owner.
Where can I get a Glock in Canada?

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.955
Most gun stores will sell them to you
if you have the proper permits.

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:27.791
In fact, despite all their tough gun laws,

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.418
take a look at what I, a foreign citizen,

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:33.588
was able to do
at the local Canadian Walmart.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.341
-Where's the ammunition at?
-Where's the ammunition?

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.051
-Yeah.
-Back here.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:44.432
-What kind are you looking for?
-You know, like, bullets.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:48.186
That's right.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:52.816
I could buy as much live ammunition
as I wanted to in Canada.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.067
Do you take American?

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.653
-Do you lock your doors?
-No.

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:59.072
Are you afraid of anything?

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:01.157
Not normally, no.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:03.451
-Do you lock your doors at night?
-No.

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.578
-You don't lock your doors?
-No.

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:08.039
What are you – Are you afraid of anything?

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.332
Not really.

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:11.918
-Have you ever been broken into?
-Yes, I have.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:14.754
What happened?

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.673
They broke into my home. I wasn't there.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:20.635
They broke in, they stole some booze,
some cigarettes, and they left.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:25.348
So I figured it must've been some teenagers
out to have a little bit of fun.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:28.310
That's all they took though –
some booze and some cigarettes.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.520
-Have you ever been a victim of crime?
-Yes.

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:32.355
What kind of crime?

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.899
I've had people walk in
while I've been sleeping

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.320
and vandalize my home and steal from me.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.739
And that didn't want to make you
lock your doors at night?

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:43.533
Nope. No.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.411
As an American
with three locks on his doors,

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.538
I found this all a bit confusing.

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:53.543
Even here in Toronto, a city of millions,
people just didn't lock their doors.

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.754
So you don't lock your doors,
but we Americans do.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:57.589
Why is that?

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.674
You must be afraid of your neighbor.

01:17:59.759 --> 01:18:02.385
Do you ever leave your doors
unlocked at home?

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:04.679
-Yes.
-Yeah? You do?

01:18:04.764 --> 01:18:06.598
-Where do you live?
-Right around here.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:07.974
-Toronto?
-Around here.

01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:09.726
-And you leave your doors unlocked?
-Yeah.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.644
You think, as Americans,

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:15.648
that the lock is keeping people
out of your place.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:19.194
We, as Canadians, see it more as

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.864
when we lock the door,
we're imprisoning ourselves inside.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.784
-You don't want to do that.
-Not really, no.

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:27.702
We don't want to –

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.246
No.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:33.792
I decided to go unannounced
to a neighborhood in Toronto

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.628
to see if this unlocked door thing was true.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.756
Hi. Sorry. Just checking.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.596
--Hello.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.854
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:58.942
Nobody locks their doors.
Nobody locks their doors in this town!

01:18:59.026 --> 01:19:01.861
-You want it locked?
-No, no, no.

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:03.905
-You like living here?
-I like it very much.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:06.366
-And the T-shirt?
-The T-shirt too.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.494
This door was wide open.
And you're not afraid?

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.413
-Should I be afraid?
-I don't know. You live here.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.206
-I don't think I'm afraid.
-You're not, are you?

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.707
-Thank you very much.
-All right. No problem.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.168
-I'm sorry about the intrusion.
-No problem.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:20.004
-And thank you for not shooting me.
-No problem. No, no, no.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.214
-Bye-bye.
-Okay.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:25.093
As an American, I gotta say
this all seemed kind of strange

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.929
until I looked up at the TV in the bar

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:31.182
and noticed what they watch
for their evening news.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:32.600
They're friends of ours.

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:36.146
We'll certainly listen to them
courteously and carefully.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.691
But you don't just make war
just 'cause someone says so.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:43.736
Night after night, the Canadians
weren't being pumped full of fear.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:46.781
And their politicians
seemed to talk kind of funny.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.867
Making sure they have proper day care,

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:51.202
that they have assistance
for their parents when they're elderly

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:52.912
and need to be in an old age home,

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:56.916
that they have proper health care that ensures
they won't lose their business or their house

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:58.793
because they can't afford
their medical bills.

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:00.378
That's how you build a good society.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:01.963
No one wins unless everyone wins,

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.757
and you don't win by beating up on people
who can't defend themselves.

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:09.053
That's been the approach spreading in some
right-wing governments across North America.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.764
They pick on the people
that can't defend themselves,

01:20:11.849 --> 01:20:14.851
and at the same time, they're turning around
and giving financial support

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:18.062
and tax breaks and tax benefits
to people that don't need them.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:20.940
Where are the indigent in this city?
Where do they live?

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:23.776
Indigent?

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.654
You act like you've never heard
the word before.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:30.116
There's – We don't have
that problem here, really.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:33.161
So I asked him, "Could you at least
take me to a Canadian slum?"

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:37.832
And, well, this is what
a ghetto looks like in Canada.

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:41.127
Is this the same sort of mentality
that says, with Canadians,

01:20:41.212 --> 01:20:43.505
you think if somebody gets sick,

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.465
they should actually be able
to have health care?

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.383
- Definitely.
- Yes.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.302
Yeah.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.179
Why?

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.764
-Because!
-Human rights.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.390
Everyone's got the right to live.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.809
-Did you just come out of the emergency room?
-Yes, I did.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:59.187
And how much did you have to pay
for your treatment?

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:03.483
I wouldn't know what the bill is.
It's covered by our hospital plan.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:06.110
-You're telling me you didn't have to pay anything?
-No, I don't.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.279
I have family that lives in the States.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:11.032
They used to live in Canada
and moved over there,

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.951
and it's so different.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:16.371
- They get afraid more easily.
- Yeah.

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.831
Yup. Very much so.

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:23.002
Because everybody reacts
over there just like that.

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:25.505
They don't stop and think.

01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:27.674
First reaction is pull the gun up.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:30.176
"You're on my property."

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:31.761
You know, like –

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.724
I don't know. It's just different over here.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.935
-Where do you live?
-Detroit.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.938
-Come over to Canada for the night?
-Right.

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:45.191
People are a little more open-minded here,
a little more welcoming.

01:21:45.276 --> 01:21:48.111
Feel any difference
when you cross over to this country?

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:50.113
-Be honest now. Come on.
-It's a lot lighter.

01:21:50.197 --> 01:21:54.742
The segregation over there is definitely
much more intensified in the States.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:56.661
Yeah.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.329
So you can feel it.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.832
Almost like they just let you be.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:02.333
That's Canada for you.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:06.379
Every time I turn on the TV in the States,
it's always about a murder here,

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.631
a gunfight, hostile position.

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:12.343
I just think the States,
their view of things is fighting.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.137
That's how they resolve everything.

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:16.723
If there's something going on
in another country,

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:20.268
they send people over to fight it.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.812
They are the most powerful country
in the world though. Sorry.

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:25.106
Canada's more like, "Let's negotiate.
Let's work something out,"

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.443
where the States is, "We'll just kill you,
and that'll be the end of that."

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:31.446
Um, if guns were –

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.906
If more guns made people safer,

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.909
then America would be one
of the safest countries in the world.

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.661
It isn't. It's the opposite.

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:25.458
I heard that 911 call on TV someplace.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.835
It was horrible. It was just –

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.297
He kept saying, "Where's the shooter?"
She said, "He's gone. I need some help."

01:23:31.382 --> 01:23:34.008
- And the little girl was in there too?
- She was on the floor.

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:35.885
-She was on the floor?
-Mm-hmm.

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:37.929
And the police and the medics came?

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.391
By that time, the medics were here.
The medics had just come in.

01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:44.227
And I remember him stepping in
and taking over the room.

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:46.521
-He says, "You have to leave."
-Right.

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:49.565
And then when the medics come in,
when the police come in,

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:51.442
you're no longer in control.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.945
Was she still alive then? Probably not.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.406
Her lips had begun to turn blue.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.076
Back in my hometown of Flint, Michigan,

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.913
a six-year-old, first-grade boy
at Buell Elementary

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:07.417
had found a gun at his uncle's house
where he was staying

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:09.919
because his mother was being evicted.

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:13.923
He brought the gun to school
and shot another first-grader,

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:17.093
six-year-old Kayla Rolland.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:19.470
With one bullet
that passed through her body,

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:22.223
she fell to the floor and laid there dying

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:25.852
while her teacher called 911 for help.

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:29.522
No one knew why the little boy
wanted to shoot the little girl.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:34.527
As if the city had not been through enough
horror and tragedy in the past two decades,

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:37.113
it was now home to a new record –

01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:40.783
the youngest school shooting ever
in the United States.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.578
On the morning of the shooting,

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:47.707
it only took the news helicopters
and satellite trucks a half hour

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.250
to show up on the scene.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:50.960
Leave your mike on.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:54.046
They're checking the truck.
We're doing one in 30 minutes.

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:57.008
This evening about 7:00
will be a public memorial service.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.886
We are expecting hundreds of people.

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.554
They will mourn the loss of little Kayla,

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:04.557
a tiny little girl
who loved pizza, teddy bears

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.851
and who was taken away from us
much too soon.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:07.769
Gina?

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:09.270
Good morning, Christine.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:12.398
The funeral home now passing out
tens of thousands of these pink ribbons

01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:14.484
to support the young girl's family.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:18.988
Today will be an emotional day
and has been already, remembering little Kayla.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:20.698
Jeff Rossen, Fox 2 News.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.786
Nice job.

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:29.457
Yeah, Michelle,
we're having technical problems, okay?

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:32.585
Well, don't talk to me about it.
Call our sat truck.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.088
I need a haircut, man. I'm a pig.

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.548
A rug.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:39.133
Here we go.

01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:47.099
Some too choked up even to speak about it.

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:50.061
There's a memorial service
scheduled here for 7:00 tonight.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.313
We're live in Flint, Michigan this afternoon.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:54.398
Jeff Rossen, Q13 reports.

01:25:58.946 --> 01:26:00.822
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:04.951
- I kind of need it, don't I?
- Yeah, you do.

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:08.454
I have some. I just didn't put it in.
I didn't have a chance.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:13.292
This man prayed for Kayla,
then let the balloon go.

01:26:14.253 --> 01:26:17.046
I see we have the color picture,
not the black and white card.

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:19.340
There are plenty of media here
that covered Columbine.

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:21.717
There are some networks, especially,

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:24.887
that go from, unfortunately,
tragedy to tragedy.

01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:28.558
And I feel bad for them
because that's all they see.

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:32.019
Tragedies.

01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:37.066
We're just trying to crunch right now
for the 5:00 and the 6:00.

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:41.612
Today we're feeding CNN and Fox, so...

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:45.741
The national media
had never visited Buell Elementary

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.828
or the Beecher school district
in which it sat,

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:51.330
or this part of Flint ever before.

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:54.876
And few, if any,
of these reporters bothered to visit it

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.545
even when they were here now.

01:26:57.629 --> 01:27:01.841
If they had ventured just a block away
from the school or the funeral home,

01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:03.968
they might have seen
a different kind of tragedy

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:08.556
that perhaps would contain some answers
as to why this little girl was dead.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.644
For over 20 years, this impoverished area

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:16.856
in the hometown
of the world's largest corporation,

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.817
had been ignored as completely
as it had been destroyed.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:25.281
With 87 percent of the students
living below the official poverty line,

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.950
Buell and Beecher and Flint

01:27:28.035 --> 01:27:31.412
did not fit into the accepted
and widely circulated story line

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:34.165
put forth by the nation's media.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:40.588
That being the one about America
and its invincible economy.

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:49.305
The number-one cause of death
among young people in this part of Flint

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:51.098
was homicide.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:55.019
The football field at Flint Beecher
was sponsored by a funeral home.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:02.360
The kids at Beecher have won
13 state track championships,

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:04.820
but they've never had a home track meet

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:09.408
because around the football field
all they have is this dirt ring.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:17.333
Years ago, someone here named
the streets in this part of town

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.543
after all the Ivy League schools,

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.924
as if they dreamed of better days
and something greater for themselves.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:35.726
The children are doing well.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:39.647
Faculty and staff are doing well.
But we don't forget.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.232
We don't forget.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:46.445
I just don't want this to happen
to anybody else.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.823
--I know.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:52.994
I know. I don't want it to happen
to anybody else either.

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:56.455
- I thought it would, um –
- It's okay.

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.457
It's okay.

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.543
It's okay.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:02.128
It's okay.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.758
--I'm sorry.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.468
That's all right.

01:29:11.972 --> 01:29:14.390
From my cold, dead hands!

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:20.312
Just as he did
after the Columbine shooting,

01:29:20.397 --> 01:29:24.650
Charlton Heston showed up in Flint
to have a big, pro-gun rally.

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:28.529
Freedom has never seen greater peril

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:33.159
nor needed you more urgently
to come to her defense than now.

01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:35.828
Before he came to Flint,
Heston was interviewed

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:38.330
by The Georgetown Hoya
about Kayla's death,

01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:41.125
and even his own NRA website
talked about it.

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:45.463
We wanted to let the NRA know that
we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:49.008
How could they come here?
To me, it's like they're rubbing our nose in it.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:52.053
I was shocked and appalled
that they were coming.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:55.473
Heston was asked
by a local reporter why he came to Flint

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:58.142
after the tragedy of Buell

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:03.147
and what did the NRA have to say
about six-year-olds using guns?

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:07.151
We spend $21 million every year.

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.404
We teach it to five and six-year-olds.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:13.824
We say if you see a gun, don't touch it.

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:15.910
Leave the room. Call an adult.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:19.830
And then Moses himself showed up.

01:30:19.915 --> 01:30:22.583
- Right here in the city of Flint?
- Right here in Flint.

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.419
Were there people
that wanted you to try this child?

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:27.171
Or even try him as an adult?

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.799
Yeah.

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:32.802
There were people from all over America

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:35.554
that wrote and called and sent mail.

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:38.432
It was amazing to me.

01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:41.894
Groups that were affiliated with the NRA,

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:45.940
groups that –
people that I call gun nuts –

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:48.567
writing me and telling me
what a horrible thing it was

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:53.072
that I had admonished homeowners
in our country

01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:56.659
to be careful about bringing weapons
into their home.

01:30:56.743 --> 01:31:00.246
They wanted this little boy hung
from the highest tree.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:05.626
There was such an undercurrent
of racism and hate and anger.

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:08.796
Um... it was ugly.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.050
That's a picture that the little boy
that was involved in the Buell School shooting,

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:15.469
once he was brought back here
to our office

01:31:15.554 --> 01:31:18.139
about 15 minutes
after the shooting took place.

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:21.475
I gave him some crayons and stuff
to occupy him a little bit.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:24.103
He came over and drew that picture for me

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:27.565
because at the time, I had pictures
behind my desk that my children drew for me,

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:29.775
and he wanted to draw me one
to hang behind my desk.

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.695
This is what he drew for you.
What did he say this was?

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:34.405
That's him at his house.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:36.574
That's him at his house, right here.

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:39.785
And why did you decide to hang onto it?

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:44.081
Because of the gravity of the situation
and what had occurred.

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:46.167
And he asked me
to hang that behind my desk,

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:49.545
so I put it in a frame,
and that's where it will stay.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:55.384
Tamarla Owens was the mother
of the six-year-old boy.

01:31:55.468 --> 01:31:58.721
In order to get food stamps
and health care for her children,

01:31:58.805 --> 01:32:01.891
Tamarla was forced to work
as part of the state of Michigan's

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:04.435
Welfare to Work program.

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:09.190
This program was so successful
in tossing poor people off welfare,

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.317
that its founder, Gerald Miller,

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:14.069
was soon hired
by the number-one firm in the country

01:32:14.154 --> 01:32:17.531
that states turn to
to privatize their welfare systems.

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:21.076
That firm was Lockheed Martin.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.165
With the Cold War over
and no enemy left to frighten the public,

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:29.001
Lockheed had found
the perfect way to diversify

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:32.004
and the perfect way
to profit from people's fears

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:34.715
with an enemy much closer to home –

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:38.344
poor black mothers like Tamarla Owens.

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:40.262
So you've got a one-parent family,

01:32:40.347 --> 01:32:44.141
and the mother's traveling 60 miles,
an hour and a half away to go to work,

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.310
an hour and a half to come home.

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:48.604
How does that help a community?

01:32:48.688 --> 01:32:52.274
But that's part of the state
making parents responsible,

01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:53.901
making them work for their money.

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:55.402
-Welfare to Work.
-Welfare to Work.

01:32:55.487 --> 01:33:00.282
That's a program that ought to be stopped
because it really has no merit.

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:04.370
I think it adds more to the problem
than it does to solve it.

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:07.081
Really?
You're the sheriff, and you feel this way?

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.874
I do. I do.

01:33:08.959 --> 01:33:12.962
I wish I could put two parents in every home
and make every parent equally responsible,

01:33:13.046 --> 01:33:14.797
but you can't do that.

01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:17.800
But we're not doing anything by taking
the one parent and putting them on a bus

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:21.220
and sending them out of town
to make $5.50 an hour.

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:25.933
This is the bus
that she was forced to ride every day

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:28.727
in order to work off the welfare money
the state had given her.

01:33:32.274 --> 01:33:34.692
She and many others from Flint
who were poor

01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:37.528
would make the 80-mile round-trip journey
every day

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:40.864
from Flint to Auburn Hills in Oakland County,

01:33:40.949 --> 01:33:43.575
one of the wealthiest areas in the country.

01:33:45.662 --> 01:33:49.456
Tamarla would leave early in the morning
and return late at night,

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:52.501
rarely seeing her young children.

01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:55.921
What's the point in doing that?

01:33:56.006 --> 01:33:59.508
Where does the state benefit?
Where does Flint and Genesee County benefit?

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:04.138
We have a child dead.
I think that may be part of the problem.

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:06.223
We drove the one parent out.

01:34:08.518 --> 01:34:12.146
Now, you or anybody else that can tell me

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:15.274
that that best serves a community,

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:17.735
I shake my head and wonder why.

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.071
How long have you been riding the bus?

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.699
I've been working here
just about three years now.

01:34:23.783 --> 01:34:25.492
-About three years?
-Yeah.

01:34:25.577 --> 01:34:27.911
I got my brother working here.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:30.414
Half of my neighborhood works out here.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.500
Just about everybody I know personally
works out here in the mall.

01:34:33.585 --> 01:34:37.629
In Flint, doing the same thing I'm doing now,
they only pay minimum wage.

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:41.967
I come 40 miles to make
three or four dollars more an hour.

01:34:42.052 --> 01:34:44.595
-How much you make an hour here?
-I make 8.50 an hour.

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:46.472
8.50?

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:48.474
-Is that enough to pay the bills?
-No.

01:34:48.558 --> 01:34:53.729
Did you know Tamarla Owens,
the woman whose son shot the little girl?

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:55.522
I think she rode this bus.

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.317
I knew her a little bit. Not real good.

01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:00.319
-Nice lady?
-Yeah, she was okay.

01:35:00.403 --> 01:35:04.281
She came to work every day.
She did her job. She worked two jobs.

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:07.659
-Worked two jobs?
-She was trying to make ends meet.

His restaurant

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:58.794
applied for special tax breaks because
they were using welfare people as employees.

Even though Tamarla worked up to 70 hours
a week at these two jobs in the mall,

she did not earn enough to pay her rent,

01:36:06.845 --> 01:36:09.555
and one week before the shooting

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:12.641
was told by her landlord
that he was evicting her.

01:36:13.643 --> 01:36:17.646
With nowhere to go and not wanting
to take her two children out of school,

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:21.358
Tamarla asked her brother
if they could stay with him for a few weeks.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:26.196
It was there that Tamarla's son
found a small .32-caliber gun

01:36:26.281 --> 01:36:28.365
and took it to school.

Tamarla did not see him
take the gun to school

01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:34.329
because she was on a state bus
to go serve drinks

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:36.290

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:50.113
took a back seat to fear, panic,
and a new set of priorities.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:52.574
One way to express our unity

01:37:52.659 --> 01:37:56.662
is for Congress to set the military budget,

01:37:56.746 --> 01:37:58.622
the defense of the United States,

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.624
as a number-one priority

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.376
and fully fund my request.

01:38:08.007 --> 01:38:11.552
We've been selling a lot of chemical suits
with the gloves and the hoods.

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:14.221
And we've been selling a lot of gas masks.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:16.557
I'm trying to get one for myself and my puppy.

01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:19.768
Dennis Marks and his wife
have been stocking up supplies.

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.979
Weapons. Ammunition.

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:26.233
Walmart says after
September 11, gun sales surged 70 percent,

01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:28.610
ammunition up 140 percent.

01:38:28.695 --> 01:38:32.739
In Dallas, they're already taking pot shots
at Osama bin Laden.

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:35.492
In the months following the 9/11 attacks,

01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:38.579
we Americans
were gripped in a state of fear.

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:42.249
None of us knew if we too would die
at the hands of the evildoers

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:45.919
or who might be sitting next to some crazy guy
trying to light his shoes on fire.

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:49.464
The threats seemed very real.

01:38:49.549 --> 01:38:53.176
It's probably a little paranoia,
but I'm not gonna take the chance, that's all.

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:55.012
Just trying to protect myself and my family.

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:59.141
Our growing fears were turned
into a handsome profit for many.

01:38:59.225 --> 01:39:04.104
Mike Blake has seen a 30 percent
increase in sales at ADT over the last month.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:09.276
Most of the people he talks to are still uneasy
over the September 11 terrorist attacks.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.111
How are we afraid of all these things?

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.822
It's because a lot of people
are making a lot of money off of it

01:39:13.906 --> 01:39:16.950
and a lot of careers off of it.

01:39:17.035 --> 01:39:21.622
And so there's vested interests,
a lot of activity to keep us afraid.

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:24.583
And what better way
to fight box cutter-wielding terrorists

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:27.794
than to order a record number
of fighter jets from Lockheed?

01:39:27.879 --> 01:39:30.088
Yes, everyone felt safer,

01:39:30.173 --> 01:39:33.967
especially with the army doing
garbage detail on Park Avenue.

01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:37.429
And the greatest benefit of all
of a terrorized public

01:39:37.513 --> 01:39:42.267
is that the corporate and political leaders
can get away with just about anything.

01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:47.064
I've never seen a better example
of cash-and-carry government

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:51.985
than this Bush administration and Enron.

01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:55.739
There were a lot of things I didn't know
after the World Trade Center attack,

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.241
but one thing was clear.

01:39:58.326 --> 01:40:01.411
Whether it was before
or after September 11,

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:04.247
a public that's this out of control with fear

01:40:04.332 --> 01:40:07.209
should not have a lot of guns
or ammo laying around.

01:40:10.213 --> 01:40:13.882
Well, I was shot with a Tec-9.

01:40:13.966 --> 01:40:15.926
- Nine millimeter?
- Yeah.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.511
Yeah, it was –

01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:21.848
I guess it was supposed
to be semiautomatic,

01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:24.142
but it kind of seemed
like fully automatic to me,

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:25.644
from what I remember.

01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:27.270
This is Richard Castaldo.

01:40:28.314 --> 01:40:30.440
And this is Mark Taylor.

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:33.777
Both of these boys were shot
the day of the Columbine massacre.

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:37.989
Richard is paralyzed for life
and in a wheelchair.

01:40:38.074 --> 01:40:42.160
And Mark is barely standing
after numerous operations.

01:40:42.245 --> 01:40:44.746
The kids at Columbine
had to pay a penalty.

01:40:44.831 --> 01:40:48.625
We paid a penalty that day for this nation,
the way we look at it.

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:51.628
Mark and Richard
were disabled and suffering

01:40:51.713 --> 01:40:56.133
from the 17-cent Kmart bullets
still embedded in their bodies.

01:40:56.801 --> 01:40:59.886
As they showed me
the various entry points for the bullets,

01:40:59.971 --> 01:41:04.891
I thought of one way we could reduce
the number of guns and bullets laying around.

01:41:04.976 --> 01:41:07.811
I asked the boys
if they'd like to go to Kmart

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:10.147
to return the merchandise.

01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:14.860
- Ready?
- Y... You go.

01:41:14.944 --> 01:41:16.278
- Me?
- Yep.

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.587
Cool.

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:36.006
Okay.

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:48.226
Do you want me to grab –

01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:50.228
- That comes out.
- Okay.

01:41:50.313 --> 01:41:51.855
There we go.

01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.316
Hi.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.360
-Excuse me. Turn the camera off, please.
-We're here to see Mr. Conaway.

01:41:57.445 --> 01:41:59.905
Okay, you have to turn the camera off
while you're in the building

01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:01.698
till I get clearance for you
to turn it back on.

01:42:01.783 --> 01:42:03.784
All right. Turn it off.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:06.495
-Hi, Michael.
-Hi. How are you?

01:42:06.579 --> 01:42:09.831
I'm Mary Lorenz.
I'm director of media relations for Kmart.

01:42:09.916 --> 01:42:11.917
- Good.
- How can I help you today?

01:42:12.001 --> 01:42:14.836
I'm here today – This is Richard Castaldo.

01:42:14.921 --> 01:42:17.631
-Richard, nice to meet you.
-And this is Mark Taylor.

01:42:17.715 --> 01:42:18.882
Mark.

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.551
And they're students
from Columbine High School.

01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:25.472
They were shot at Columbine
in the massacre

01:42:25.556 --> 01:42:27.057
with bullets from Kmart.

01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:29.893
You came a long way,
all the way from Colorado.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:34.022
Yeah, I was just thinking that,

01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:36.149
since you stopped
selling the handguns and all,

01:42:36.234 --> 01:42:39.945
that it kind of made sense
to stop selling the bullets too.

01:42:40.029 --> 01:42:43.114
Our request is that you get rid
of the nine-millimeter bullets

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:45.283
and that you don't sell them
in the store completely.

01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:48.119
We do carry –
You probably are aware of Kmart.

01:42:48.204 --> 01:42:50.205
Hopefully, you're shoppers of our stores.

01:42:50.289 --> 01:42:54.376
That we do only carry sporting firearms

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:59.798
and the accessories
that go with the hunting sport.

01:42:59.882 --> 01:43:04.135
We'll certainly take your message
to our chairman and CEO, Chuck Conaway.

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:06.596
-He's not here today.
-He's not here today?

01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:08.682
He's not here actually this whole week.

01:43:08.766 --> 01:43:10.767
Not at all during the week?

01:43:10.852 --> 01:43:14.729
Do you have a limit on the number of bullets,
ammunition that people can purchase?

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:16.773
I can't answer these questions for you.

01:43:16.858 --> 01:43:19.442
I'm not the merchandiser
who places those products.

01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:21.027
Can we speak to that person?

01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:25.031
But I can get answers to those questions for you
if you would like to leave your card.

01:43:25.116 --> 01:43:27.284
-I can get those answers for you.
-We don't want to leave a card.

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:30.662
Let me just be blunt. The reason why
we can't take a card and come back

01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:34.499
is because Mark here, he's got
a Kmart bullet just an inch away –

01:43:34.584 --> 01:43:36.751
-Right? From your aorta?
-Yeah.

01:43:36.836 --> 01:43:40.005
-In between my aorta and spine.
-Between your aorta and spine.

01:43:40.089 --> 01:43:42.841
I'm glad to see
that you're still able to stand.

01:43:42.925 --> 01:43:45.677
I told them
that somebody here would listen,

01:43:45.761 --> 01:43:50.724
somebody here would – would –
would take their request seriously.

01:43:50.808 --> 01:43:53.894
Not just a PR person,
but somebody who has some authority,

01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:57.480
who can answer some of the questions
that they want answered.

01:43:57.565 --> 01:44:00.901
Kmart does care about this,
but I can't go any further right now.

01:44:00.985 --> 01:44:04.988
So, until I make a call,
I'm going to go back to the office

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:07.324
and see if there's anyone
in merchandising.

01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:11.244
Mary went back upstairs
and two hours later,

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:15.665
she brought down this guy
whose job it is to buy the bullets for Kmart.

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:18.335
-Stay out of trouble.
-Yes.

01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:20.754
We're not the ones in trouble, guys.

01:44:20.838 --> 01:44:23.214
Mark thought
he'd show him his bullet wounds.

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:26.927
Those are his bullet holes
from your bullets.

01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:30.305
That's where the Kmart bullets went in.

01:44:30.389 --> 01:44:31.681
Well, take care.

01:44:31.766 --> 01:44:34.434
Is anybody else gonna come down?

01:44:34.518 --> 01:44:36.519
Is anybody else gonna come down?
Is that it?

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.772
-Let me check.
-Okay. Thank you.

01:44:39.398 --> 01:44:43.693
We waited around a couple more hours,
but no one else came down.

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:47.697
As we left the building,
Mark came up with an idea.

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:52.577
He suggested that we go to the nearest Kmart
and buy out all their bullets.

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.623
Just take as many of those as you can.

01:44:56.707 --> 01:44:59.125
You can come around here and look.

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:01.628
What else do we have over here?

01:45:01.712 --> 01:45:04.881
You got .357s? Sure.
I'll take them all. Take everything you got.

01:45:05.508 --> 01:45:08.510
-So you're 17, and you're what?
-Sixteen.

01:45:08.594 --> 01:45:10.595
- Shit.
- Be careful.

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.430
My God, Craig.

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:16.726
Mark pretty much cleaned them out
of their ammunition.

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:21.022
And the next day we decided to go back
to Kmart headquarters with all the bullets.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:24.818
This time we brought the press.

01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:28.655
Our local first coverage of southeastern
Michigan continues now with all-new stories.

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:30.365
Coming up here in our 6:00 report,

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:32.867
a warning to everyone this summer
to watch out for snakes.

01:45:32.952 --> 01:45:36.162
You'll hear from a mom
who was bitten by a rattlesnake.

01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:40.458
And also new, students who survived
the Columbine massacre are in town.

01:45:40.543 --> 01:45:42.377
They are very angry with Kmart.

01:45:42.461 --> 01:45:44.921
We're here to see Chuck Conaway,
the chairman of Kmart.

01:45:45.006 --> 01:45:46.673
- How you doing, sir?
- How you doing?

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:49.759
It's always a pleasure to see you.
Okay. –

01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:53.388
They would like to speak with Mr. Conaway.

01:45:55.224 --> 01:45:57.851
Here's the nine millimeters.

01:45:57.935 --> 01:46:00.520
These are the bullets
that are in both Richard

01:46:00.604 --> 01:46:03.606
and in Mark's body right now.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:06.735
Want to take that?
I don't want to touch those.

01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:08.820
I will do that for you, sir.

01:46:10.948 --> 01:46:13.575
Move your group outside,
I'll have somebody here in five minutes.

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:16.453
Do me a favor. Don't block the door.
Just off to the side, if you would.

01:46:16.537 --> 01:46:18.621
We'll go outside,
and somebody will come out.

01:46:18.706 --> 01:46:20.457
My name's Lori McTavish.

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:23.293
I'm the vice president of communications
for Kmart.

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:25.879
I'm happy to deliver a statement
on behalf of the company.

01:46:25.963 --> 01:46:29.549
What happened in Columbine, Colorado
was truly tragic

01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:31.551
and touched every American.

01:46:31.635 --> 01:46:36.097
And we're sorry for the disadvantage
to this young man.

01:46:36.182 --> 01:46:39.684
Kmart is phasing out the sale
of handgun ammunition.

01:46:39.769 --> 01:46:42.353
The business plan calls
for this to be complete

01:46:42.438 --> 01:46:46.524
in the continental US
within the next 90 days.

01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:49.277
-Wow!
-Kmart representatives met Mr. Moore

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:52.572
and the students
from Columbine, Colorado yesterday

01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:54.657
and listened to their concerns

01:46:54.742 --> 01:46:57.702
about the product carried in Kmart stores.

01:46:57.787 --> 01:47:00.705
The company committed,
at the end of that meeting,

01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:04.292
that Kmart would have an answer for them
within a week's time.

01:47:04.376 --> 01:47:06.836
Well, the first thing we want to do
is thank you

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:12.258
for committing to no longer selling
handgun ammunition in your stores

01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:13.718
and within 90 days.

01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:16.096
The process will be phased out
within 90 days.

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.932
And after 90 days, there will be
no more selling of ammunition

01:47:19.016 --> 01:47:21.226
that can go into handguns
or assault weapons.

01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:25.271
Firearm ammunition will be –
We will not sell it after 90 days in our stores.

01:47:25.356 --> 01:47:27.732
-Well, we greatly appreciate that.
-Thank you.

01:47:27.817 --> 01:47:31.236
Thank you very much.
Thank you. This is very great.

01:47:33.656 --> 01:47:36.866
Thank you. Wow. That blows my mind.

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:38.576
That's more than what we asked for.

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:40.829
-This is remarkable.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:47:40.913 --> 01:47:43.915
-Well, like I told you – Did you think?
-No.

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:45.416
I'm, like – We're, like –

01:47:45.501 --> 01:47:47.502
We were just getting ready
to go to the air –

01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:49.629
-We were getting ready to go home.
-Go to the airport.

01:47:49.713 --> 01:47:49.754
The kids from Columbine had scored
an overwhelming victory against Kmart,

01:47:49.755 --> 01:47:53.758
The kids from Columbine had scored
an overwhelming victory against Kmart,

01:47:53.843 --> 01:47:57.637
and it inspired me to do something
that I knew I had to do.

01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:02.308
All I needed was a star map.

01:48:21.912 --> 01:48:23.788
-Hello?
-Mr. Heston?

01:48:23.873 --> 01:48:26.166
- Yeah.
-This is Michael Moore.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:27.500
- Yes.
-The filmmaker?

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:29.586
-Yes, of course.
-Yes. How you doing?

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:31.087
Fine, thank you.

01:48:31.172 --> 01:48:33.715
Listen, I was wondering
if maybe I could talk to you.

01:48:33.799 --> 01:48:37.969
We're making a documentary
about the whole gun issue,

01:48:38.053 --> 01:48:39.721
and I'm a member of the NRA.

01:48:39.805 --> 01:48:42.265
I thought maybe we could
talk a little bit about the –

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.392
Tell you what. Let me look at my calendar.

01:48:44.476 --> 01:48:46.728
I may be able to give you
some time tomorrow.

01:48:46.812 --> 01:48:48.605
I have some people here now.

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:50.732
How can I – Pardon me?

01:48:50.816 --> 01:48:52.317
- Hold the phone.
-Okay. Thank you.

01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:55.904
Okay. I can give you a little time
tomorrow morning.

01:48:55.988 --> 01:48:58.198
- I think that's Thursday.
-Yes.

01:48:58.282 --> 01:49:00.909
-Let's say 8:30.
-8:30 in the morning?

01:49:00.993 --> 01:49:02.994
Okay. And just come here?

01:49:03.078 --> 01:49:05.205
-Here. Yeah.
-Yes. Okay, good.

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.585
--Hello?

01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:13.087
Hi. It's Michael Moore here
to see Charlton Heston.

01:49:13.172 --> 01:49:15.173
- Okay.

01:49:34.735 --> 01:49:36.236
Hi.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.820
Good morning.

01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:44.244
-How are you?
-Fine, thank you.

01:49:44.328 --> 01:49:46.788
Thank you very much
for agreeing to see me.

01:49:54.922 --> 01:49:57.340
He took me out
to his pool and tennis house

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:59.801
so we could have a chat.

01:49:59.885 --> 01:50:02.470
I told him that I was a lifetime member
of the NRA

01:50:02.554 --> 01:50:04.806
and showed him my membership card.

01:50:04.890 --> 01:50:06.683
Good for you. Well done.

01:50:06.767 --> 01:50:09.769
-I assume you have guns in the house here?
-Indeed, I do.

01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:12.480
Bad guys, take notice.

01:50:12.564 --> 01:50:15.108
-So you have 'em for protection?
-Yeah. Sure.

01:50:15.192 --> 01:50:17.819
-Have you ever been a victim of crime?
-No. No.

01:50:17.903 --> 01:50:20.905
-Never – Yeah. Never been assaulted?
-No.

01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:23.992
No violence toward you,
but you have guns in the house.

01:50:24.076 --> 01:50:25.868
-Loaded.
-Loaded. They're loaded?

01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:29.956
Well, if you really need a weapon
for self-defense,

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.791
you need it loaded.

01:50:31.875 --> 01:50:34.002
Okay, but why do you need it
for self-defense?

01:50:34.086 --> 01:50:34.961
I don't.

01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:37.588
You've never been a victim of crime.
You haven't been assaulted here.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:39.549
-That's true.
-Why would you –

01:50:39.633 --> 01:50:42.969
So why don't you unload the gun?

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:47.557
Because, uh, the Second Amendment
gives me the right to have it loaded.

01:50:47.641 --> 01:50:49.851
I agree. I totally agree with that.

01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:52.603
But I'm just saying
the Second Amendment gives me –

01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:55.398
Let's say it's a comfort factor, you know?

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:57.692
It gives you comfort to know
that there's a loaded gun?

01:50:57.776 --> 01:50:58.776
Yeah.

01:50:58.861 --> 01:51:01.446
Comfort, meaning it allows you
to relax and feel safe?

01:51:01.530 --> 01:51:03.865
-Not worry about it.
-Not worry, not be afraid.

01:51:03.949 --> 01:51:08.953
And I'm not really,
but I'm exercising one of the rights

01:51:09.038 --> 01:51:10.872
passed on down to me

01:51:10.956 --> 01:51:14.083
from those wise, old, dead, white guys
that invented this country.

01:51:14.168 --> 01:51:16.627
If it was good enough for them,
it's good enough for me.

01:51:16.712 --> 01:51:20.882
You could still exercise the right by having
the gun unloaded and locked away somewhere.

01:51:20.966 --> 01:51:22.258
I choose to have it.

01:51:22.343 --> 01:51:26.179
What sort of strikes me as interesting
is that in other countries,

01:51:26.263 --> 01:51:29.766
where they don't have the murder rate,
the gun murder rate that we have,

01:51:29.850 --> 01:51:33.353
that many people say that's because
they don't have guns around.

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:37.231
It's hard to get a gun in Britain
or Germany or whatever.

01:51:37.316 --> 01:51:39.067
But we went to Canada,

01:51:39.151 --> 01:51:41.903
and there's seven million guns
in ten million homes.

01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:44.572
-There won't be very long.
-But hear me out though.

01:51:44.656 --> 01:51:46.449
Canada is a nation of hunters.

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:51.412
Millions of guns, and yet they had
just a few murders last year.

01:51:51.497 --> 01:51:53.539
That's it.
Of a country of 30 million people.

01:51:53.624 --> 01:51:54.916
Here's my question.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.003
Why is it that they've got
all these guns laying around,

01:51:59.088 --> 01:52:02.590
yet they don't kill each other
at the level that we kill each other?

01:52:02.674 --> 01:52:08.513
I think American history
has a lot of blood on its hands.

01:52:08.597 --> 01:52:10.348
-And German history doesn't?
-No.

01:52:10.432 --> 01:52:13.226
-And British history?
-I don't think as much.

01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:16.396
Germans don't have
as much blood on their hands?

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.064
-They do, yes.
-The Brits?

01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:21.359
They ruled the world for 300 years
at the barrel of a gun.

01:52:21.443 --> 01:52:25.113
They're all violent people.
They have bad guys, they have crime.

01:52:25.197 --> 01:52:27.782
They have lots of guns in the past.

01:52:27.866 --> 01:52:31.619
It's an interesting point
which can be explored,

01:52:31.703 --> 01:52:34.831
and you're good to explore it
at great length,

01:52:34.915 --> 01:52:37.917
but I think that's about all
I have to say on it.

01:52:38.001 --> 01:52:41.629
You don't have any opinion though
as to why we are the unique country,

01:52:41.713 --> 01:52:45.633
the only country that does this,
that kills each other on this level with guns?

01:52:45.717 --> 01:52:50.847
Well, we have probably
a more mixed ethnicity

01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:53.933
than other countries,
some other countries.

01:52:54.017 --> 01:52:55.685
You think it's an ethnic thing?

01:52:55.769 --> 01:52:58.604
No, I don't –
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

01:52:58.689 --> 01:53:03.067
We had enough problems
with civil rights in the beginning.

01:53:03.152 --> 01:53:06.988
It's – But I have no answer for that.

01:53:07.072 --> 01:53:09.490
What do you mean,
you think it's a mixed ethnicity?

01:53:09.575 --> 01:53:11.325
I don't understand.

01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:16.914
-You said how is it so many Americans –
-That we're unique. Yeah.

01:53:16.999 --> 01:53:18.249
kill each other.

01:53:18.333 --> 01:53:21.127
I don't know that that's true, but even –

01:53:21.211 --> 01:53:24.422
No, you know that.
We have the highest murder rate with guns.

01:53:24.506 --> 01:53:26.466
It's way higher than any other country.

01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:29.010
The only answer I can give you
is the one I already gave you.

01:53:29.094 --> 01:53:30.428
Which is?

01:53:30.512 --> 01:53:35.975
Which is that we have a history of violence,

01:53:36.059 --> 01:53:38.603
perhaps more than most countries.

01:53:38.687 --> 01:53:41.230
Not more than Russia,
not more than Japan or China.

01:53:41.315 --> 01:53:43.983
-Not more than Germany.
-Not more than Germany.

01:53:44.067 --> 01:53:46.152
But certainly more than Canada.

01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:51.491
I come from Flint, Michigan,
and last year a little six-year-old boy

01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:55.453
took a gun into a classroom
and shot and killed a six-year-old girl.

01:53:55.537 --> 01:53:58.372
And it was really a tragic thing.

01:53:58.457 --> 01:54:01.542
-This was kids though. A kid?
-Yeah. Did you hear about this?

01:54:01.627 --> 01:54:03.628
-Yeah.
-A six-year-old shooting a six-year-old.

01:54:03.712 --> 01:54:06.714
-Yeah.
-Well, here's my question though.

01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:10.635
After that happened,
you came to Flint and held a big rally.

01:54:10.719 --> 01:54:12.053
Mm-hmm.

01:54:12.137 --> 01:54:16.849
-And, you know, I just –
-So did the vice president.

01:54:16.934 --> 01:54:19.936
Yeah, but did you feel
it was being at all insensitive

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.104
to the fact that this community
had just gone through –

01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:24.690
Actually, I wasn't aware of that
at the time we came.

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:28.945
We came and did an early morning rally

01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:31.197
and went onto wherever we were going.

01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:34.408
You didn't know at the time you were there
that this killing had happened?

01:54:34.493 --> 01:54:38.079
-Had you known, would you have not come?
-Would I have canceled?

01:54:38.163 --> 01:54:40.164
I don't –

01:54:40.249 --> 01:54:43.209
-It's hard to say.
-It wasn't like it was already planned.

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:47.588
The choice to come there was made
after this horrible killing took place.

01:54:47.673 --> 01:54:48.839
Mm-hmm.

01:54:48.924 --> 01:54:51.801
Had you known that, would you have come?

01:54:51.885 --> 01:54:54.762
I don't know. I have no idea.

01:54:54.846 --> 01:54:57.807
-Maybe not? Maybe not.
-Okay. Thank you.

01:54:57.891 --> 01:55:01.143
You think you'd like to maybe apologize
to the people in Flint

01:55:01.228 --> 01:55:03.396
for coming and doing that at that time?

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.275
You want me to apologize –
me to apologize to the people in Flint?

01:55:07.359 --> 01:55:10.778
Or the people in Columbine for coming
after their horrible tragedy?

01:55:10.862 --> 01:55:14.407
Why do you go to the places
after they have these horrible tragedies?

01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:16.826
I'm a member of your group here, and I'm –

01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:19.829
I'm afraid we don't agree on that.

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:23.207
You think it's okay to just come
and show up at these events?

01:55:23.292 --> 01:55:24.959
No.

01:55:25.043 --> 01:55:27.044
You don't think it's okay?

01:55:37.889 --> 01:55:40.975
Mr. Heston, just one more thing.

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:42.643
This is who she is.

01:55:42.728 --> 01:55:44.228
Or was.

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.398
This is her. Please don't leave.

01:55:47.482 --> 01:55:50.234
Mr. Heston, please. Take a look at her.

01:55:50.319 --> 01:55:52.028
This is the girl.

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.541
I left the Heston estate atop Beverly Hills

01:56:47.626 --> 01:56:49.502
and walked back into the real world,

01:56:49.586 --> 01:56:52.880
an America living and breathing in fear.

01:56:52.964 --> 01:56:55.091
In your mind you imagine somebody

01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:58.636
who might break into your house
to harm you or your family.

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:01.222
What does that person look like?

01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:05.434
-You, her, him, the camera guy, anybody.
-Me? Her? Really?

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:07.478
There could be a gun in the camera.
I don't know.

01:57:07.562 --> 01:57:09.689
Where gun sales
were now at an all-time high.

01:57:09.773 --> 01:57:12.942
You can shoot as fast
as with a semiautomatic.

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:15.027
And where, in the end,

01:57:15.112 --> 01:57:18.447
it all comes back to bowling for Columbine.

01:57:18.532 --> 01:57:21.909
Three bowling alley employees
shot to death Sunday night

01:57:21.993 --> 01:57:23.452
at the AMF Broadway Lanes.

01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:26.664
There's nothing I really know.
I mean, I really don't know anything.

01:57:26.748 --> 01:57:30.710
Just that three people died
in Littleton in a bowling alley.

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:32.336
I'm sorry.

01:57:32.421 --> 01:57:34.422
Have a nice day.

01:57:34.506 --> 01:57:37.842
Yes, it was a glorious time
to be an American.
