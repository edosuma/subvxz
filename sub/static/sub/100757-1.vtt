06:28.172 --> 06:32.641
- What took you so long?
- Fish Mitten's. Where is she?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.409
Fish Mitten's.

06:42.586 --> 06:44.419
- What'd you do to her?
- Nothin'.

06:46.524 --> 06:49.658
There could've been, uh,
rat poison in that garbage.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.360
That could've been it.

06:52.897 --> 06:55.797
This fucking dog, Traylor,
I told you about them.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.301
Now I gotta
pick all this shit up.

06:59.303 --> 07:00.636
Shhh.

07:00.638 --> 07:02.237
Sorry, girl.

07:13.651 --> 07:15.250
Shit.

07:16.787 --> 07:19.521
What I wouldn't do
to shoot my ex's dog.

07:21.492 --> 07:22.824
Have you met my ex?

08:40.471 --> 08:41.903
You're a little early.

08:41.905 --> 08:44.940
- Early for what?
- You didn't talk to Doris?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.775
She's just getting in now.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.579
She might've called my place,
but I wasn't home.

08:50.581 --> 08:52.714
What she's supposed to be
telling me?

08:54.585 --> 08:56.652
Joseph got picked up
this morning.

08:57.755 --> 09:00.756
They got him in town, and they said
they'll only release him to you.

09:02.326 --> 09:03.725
Jesus Christ.

09:03.727 --> 09:05.460
You think this is us?

09:07.865 --> 09:09.831
Just shitty parents?

09:11.769 --> 09:13.935
I think he thinks
his dad is a fuck-up.

09:15.005 --> 09:16.838
And it gives him a free pass.

09:22.346 --> 09:25.580
I'll meet you there at noon.
No reason to get him out early.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.783
Hey.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.753
Have you seen Harley?

09:33.057 --> 09:34.956
No.
I'll keep an eye out for her.

09:55.045 --> 09:56.511
Dispatch?

09:57.014 --> 09:58.413
Doris?

10:01.752 --> 10:04.619
<i>I'm here, Chief.
I've been calling your place all morning.</i>

10:05.022 --> 10:06.688
I'm at Joss's.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.491
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

10:10.627 --> 10:12.994
Not like that. Get on with it.

10:13.964 --> 10:16.898
Skip the hillbilly antics
and just give me the highlights.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.900
<i>I'm just trying
to get organized.</i>

10:18.902 --> 10:21.703
<i>Today has been crazy,
really crazy.</i>

10:21.705 --> 10:23.672
<i>Burner called earlier.</i>

10:23.674 --> 10:27.609
<i>He said some drunk white guy
was trying to eat his chickens,</i>

10:27.611 --> 10:29.711
<i>and that if you didn't show up
soon,</i>

10:29.713 --> 10:32.114
<i>he was gonna blow
his fucking head off.</i>

10:32.116 --> 10:33.715
<i>His words, Chief.</i>

10:34.685 --> 10:36.017
Where's Bumper?

10:37.588 --> 10:39.721
<i>Where else, Chief?
He's in the woods.</i>

10:39.723 --> 10:42.557
Bring him down and get him strapped.
What else?

10:45.696 --> 10:47.629
<i>You know
Joseph got picked up?</i>

10:47.631 --> 10:50.465
I talked to Joss already.
I'll get him this afternoon.

10:51.668 --> 10:54.035
<i>That's not what I was gonna
mention, Chief.</i>

10:56.507 --> 10:57.873
Spit it out.

10:59.643 --> 11:01.676
<i>Lysol got picked up with him.</i>

11:01.979 --> 11:03.812
Of course he did.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.484
This band is open.
Keep me posted.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.856
<i>One more thing, Chief.
Your dad called.</i>

11:14.858 --> 11:16.925
<i>He sounded... scared.</i>

12:11.682 --> 12:12.948
Dad?

12:28.708 --> 12:29.708
Look inside!

12:31.001 --> 12:32.601
Look inside.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.041
Dead salmon.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.619
I think I'm going crazy.

12:51.955 --> 12:53.889
Dad, you...

12:58.962 --> 13:01.630
That... that thing is gutted!

13:02.599 --> 13:05.634
I pulled him out of the river
this morning.

13:11.174 --> 13:13.842
I've been fishing these rivers
for 60 years,

13:13.844 --> 13:16.111
I never seen nothing like that.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.649
I have gas in the trunk.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.041
Burn it.

13:49.179 --> 13:51.212
What the fuck is going on, Dad?

13:52.249 --> 13:54.082
Give me the gas and the dog.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.260
Feel like coming out
of retirement?

14:07.130 --> 14:09.698
You're a Deputy in the Red Crow
Police Department.

14:10.300 --> 14:13.001
Bumper will be up at his camp.
Bring him down.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.642
See what's up at Burner's.

14:20.644 --> 14:22.043
Don't get anyone shot.

14:25.583 --> 14:29.541
That fish is still moving.

14:49.940 --> 14:52.407
Fuck.

14:52.409 --> 14:54.376
Fuck...

14:57.280 --> 14:59.914
So you want
to quit drinking, just...

14:59.916 --> 15:02.651
fuck AA,
just lock somebody in a cell

15:02.653 --> 15:04.919
with you two fucking idiots
all night.

15:06.423 --> 15:08.323
Hey, fucking die already,
hillbilly.

15:12.262 --> 15:14.396
You here to break me out?

15:18.368 --> 15:19.817
- Come on, man.
- Hmm.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.269
I knew Dad wouldn't come and get
you, but he'd come get us.

15:21.271 --> 15:24.305
- Hmm.
- So I got arrested townie side.

15:26.043 --> 15:29.978
Ooh, do you think he's gonna come get you?
He could just leave you.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.948
My mom wouldn't let him.

15:38.455 --> 15:41.756
Thanks, man, but...
I'm no fucking charity case,

15:41.758 --> 15:44.025
and you being
Traylor's good son,

15:44.027 --> 15:47.429
any stupid shit you do,
your people are gonna hang on me.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.267
Maybe I'm just trying to fuck
with my dad, then.

15:52.269 --> 15:54.102
That's the same difference,
Joey.

15:55.939 --> 15:57.205
Whoa!

15:57.207 --> 15:58.973
Oh, my fuck!

16:00.877 --> 16:02.711
Yo!

16:02.713 --> 16:05.246
Get us outta here!!

16:13.323 --> 16:15.056
Jesus, Traylor,

16:15.058 --> 16:17.892
you said noon,
and that was an hour ago.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.794
Get the hell off RC time.

16:21.364 --> 16:22.931
I'm here.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.934
Thank you.

16:32.142 --> 16:33.408
Hello?

16:35.312 --> 16:38.113
Hey, Sham.

16:38.115 --> 16:40.081
Whenever you're ready, man.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.483
We don't got all day.

16:41.485 --> 16:42.951
Traylor.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.021
Hey, Joss.

16:47.023 --> 16:52.093
So we got some paperwork for you
to read and sign, and then, uh...

16:52.095 --> 16:56.097
me and Traylor here, I guess we'll just
do that all up just like last time.

16:57.167 --> 17:00.535
You know your boy gets arrested
more than a prostitute?

17:02.839 --> 17:04.239
I'll be in the car.

17:06.810 --> 17:08.409
She seems mad.

17:18.989 --> 17:20.955
So what'd he do?

17:24.161 --> 17:26.194
<i>Well, we caught him
on the bridge.</i>

17:29.833 --> 17:32.834
<i>He had climbed up the structure
and...</i>

17:32.836 --> 17:35.203
<i>and shimmied over the road
on the crossbar.</i>

17:39.910 --> 17:43.912
<i>And then he took a shit
on the first car that drove by.</i>

17:50.387 --> 17:54.055
<i>Happens there was a little lady
from our side of the line.</i>

17:54.057 --> 17:57.392
<i>She probably thought it was a
goddamn pterodactyl shitting on her.</i>

18:12.209 --> 18:14.475
Gross. Alright. Ahem.

18:14.477 --> 18:16.110
Let's go.

18:23.053 --> 18:25.520
It smells like a fucking ass
in here!

18:25.522 --> 18:27.422
What's with the blood?

18:28.191 --> 18:30.358
Was this guy beat up
when he came in?

18:30.360 --> 18:33.127
No, he's been clutching his guts
all night. And then he started...

18:34.364 --> 18:35.964
Come on.

18:37.334 --> 18:40.201
Don't go nowhere, shitbrains.

18:44.407 --> 18:46.574
What the fuck?! Ah!!

18:47.377 --> 18:50.245
Ah! Help!! Help!

19:00.490 --> 19:03.591
Ow! Ah, fuck! He fucking bit me.

19:09.666 --> 19:12.567
You don't bite me
when I'm fighting, motherfucker!

19:14.070 --> 19:17.105
- Come on.
- Give me that. You want to eat people?!

19:17.107 --> 19:19.540
You want to...
you want to eat people?!

19:19.542 --> 19:22.143
You want to fuckin' eat people,
you cocksucker?!

19:22.145 --> 19:23.945
Hey! Hey!

19:23.947 --> 19:25.546
- Fuckin' lost your goddamn...
- Hey, he's had...

19:25.548 --> 19:28.082
- Now you're going to get your...
- He's had enough!

19:28.084 --> 19:29.984
- ...your fuckin' hillbilly... - That's enough!
- You fucking...

19:29.986 --> 19:32.453
I'll put a new hole
in your head, you sonofabitch!!

19:32.455 --> 19:34.455
You're gonna fuckin' kill him!

19:34.457 --> 19:37.091
Lock 9!!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.660
- Ah!
- Fuck!!

19:40.363 --> 19:42.330
Looks like he got your tit.

19:44.434 --> 19:48.937
Just... just fuck off, or I'll fuckin'
put you back in there, you understand?!

19:51.474 --> 19:54.609
- Fuck.
- This is too fucked up! Where did he go? Where the...

19:54.611 --> 19:56.511
Ah!!

19:56.513 --> 19:59.147
Hey, hey,
you're not leaving me here, right?!

19:59.716 --> 20:03.017
And then this fucking
mental case just lunges, like...

20:03.019 --> 20:06.654
like lunges at Shamu and
bites him right in the chest.

20:06.656 --> 20:09.290
And me and Lysol and Traylor
trying to pull him,

20:09.292 --> 20:11.159
and then he fucking bites me,
too.

20:11.161 --> 20:13.194
I don't give a shit
who bit you.

20:13.196 --> 20:14.629
I'm ready to bite you myself.

20:18.201 --> 20:20.234
So what did you get
arrested for?

20:22.205 --> 20:23.972
Just vandalized some car.

20:25.675 --> 20:27.709
You just vandalized some car?

20:31.314 --> 20:33.281
You need to start
making better choices.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.385
I know I fucked up, Mom.

20:37.754 --> 20:39.554
Now you know?

20:41.758 --> 20:44.092
Well, maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

20:46.129 --> 20:50.365
Look, I know your heart's in the right
place, but... your head's up your ass.

20:50.367 --> 20:52.400
It's not like
I just met Charlie, Mom.

20:52.402 --> 20:54.502
It's not like I don't care
about her.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.304
Look, I really love her.

20:56.306 --> 20:58.373
Look, I'm not talkin'
about Charlie.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.575
I'm talkin' about your brother.

21:00.577 --> 21:03.678
And I'm talkin' about why you keep
getting into trouble with this guy.

21:04.781 --> 21:06.481
He doesn't have anyone else.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.284
Traylor fucking abandoned him.

21:10.286 --> 21:13.187
The whole reserve knows
what happened to his mom.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.690
I hear you and I...
I get you on that.

21:19.396 --> 21:23.297
Joseph, if you're more focused on being
a brother to Lysol than being a father...

21:24.067 --> 21:26.534
...and if the question ever
came up if you were ready...

21:27.771 --> 21:31.239
...the way you're prioritizing
your life right now is your answer.

21:36.679 --> 21:39.514
Well,
that was really fucked up.

21:41.184 --> 21:43.551
This whole day
has been fucked up.

21:43.553 --> 21:46.087
Oh, I'm sure you've had worse.

21:46.089 --> 21:47.455
<i>You on, Chief?</i>

21:52.095 --> 21:53.728
What news?

21:53.730 --> 21:55.696
<i>Shooker called and said
his girlfriend is sick,</i>

21:55.698 --> 21:58.533
<i>and the ambulance from town
still isn't picking up.</i>

21:59.436 --> 22:01.369
They never pick up.

22:01.371 --> 22:03.271
What time did he call you?

22:03.273 --> 22:05.706
And how long has he been
calling the townies?

22:05.708 --> 22:08.443
<i>Well, he called here
at 12:30 this afternoon,</i>

22:08.445 --> 22:11.112
<i>and he said he's been calling</i> for
an ambulance <i>since last night,</i>

22:11.114 --> 22:12.480
<i>but he could be lying.</i>

22:15.285 --> 22:17.385
You have no idea
how many times

22:17.387 --> 22:19.821
I've been over there
because of his bullshit.

22:21.124 --> 22:22.557
His girlfriend's still pregnant?

22:23.560 --> 22:25.159
<i>Pretty sure, boss.</i>

22:32.769 --> 22:35.203
I can't keep bailing you out,
Alan.

22:35.205 --> 22:37.138
Nobody told you
to bail me out.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.573
Tell that to your brother.

22:39.876 --> 22:42.276
Whatever you think of me...

22:42.278 --> 22:44.212
the kid deserves better.

22:44.214 --> 22:45.713
Better than what?

22:46.349 --> 22:48.182
Either one of us.

22:55.492 --> 22:57.325
Sperm donor!

23:17.847 --> 23:20.882
This is the ugliest
waiting room I've ever seen.

23:25.455 --> 23:27.155
Thanks for stopping by.

23:31.194 --> 23:32.560
I'm sorry.

23:34.364 --> 23:36.731
Everything seems like a
good idea when you're drunk.

23:38.401 --> 23:41.736
Says the teenage boy to
his pregnant teenage girlfriend.

23:41.738 --> 23:43.938
At the abortion place.

23:53.383 --> 23:54.949
I didn't even tell my dad.

23:56.586 --> 23:58.853
Are you embarrassed of me?

23:58.855 --> 24:01.455
- What in the hell happened to your arm?
- Don't change the subject.

24:01.457 --> 24:03.858
I'm not changing the subject.
I just want to know what happened.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.960
Look, some hillbilly bit me
in the drunk tank.

24:05.962 --> 24:07.595
My mom's getting me
a tetanus shot.

24:07.597 --> 24:09.363
I'm not gonna bleed to death
waiting,

24:09.365 --> 24:10.865
so can you please
answer my question?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.767
Are you embarrassed of me?

24:12.769 --> 24:14.735
No. Fuck no.

24:14.737 --> 24:16.604
I'm embarrassed of him.

24:19.642 --> 24:21.409
He's just embarrassing.

24:31.421 --> 24:32.787
You still want to do this?

24:59.649 --> 25:03.651
Lydia, are we, uh...
are we out of tetanus?

25:04.454 --> 25:05.886
How could that be?

25:05.888 --> 25:08.656
Yes, the guys in Emergency
cleared us out.

25:08.658 --> 25:11.859
They said they've been getting
a lot of bites.

25:11.861 --> 25:13.828
This town has lost its mind.

25:13.830 --> 25:15.596
A lot of bites.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.733
You got the wrong number.

25:20.470 --> 25:23.404
What's going on?

25:29.779 --> 25:32.280
Run!!

26:10.019 --> 26:12.653
- Jesus Christ, Shooker!
- She's had it.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.556
What the fuck
are you on about?

26:15.558 --> 26:18.426
There's no... no time.

26:18.995 --> 26:22.063
And where there's supposed
to be little finger nails,

26:22.065 --> 26:24.098
little yellow teeth
are growing out.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.434
Of course, you're high,

26:26.436 --> 26:28.636
you stupid cocksuckin'
fuck-face.

26:28.638 --> 26:31.605
- You should've just called a cab right away.
- I got no more money left.

26:31.607 --> 26:35.076
And nobody's gonna let us into
their house to use their phone!

26:35.078 --> 26:38.346
And they don't like her, huh, Chief?
'Cause she's white!

26:38.348 --> 26:43.417
- Is she alright, at least?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:43.419 --> 26:46.020
She's definitely not alright,
Chief.

26:47.890 --> 26:51.025
And I got no more coke here. I don't
want anymore. I don't want anymore.

26:51.027 --> 26:54.061
I swear to God, if you don't
get a hold of yourself,

26:54.063 --> 26:57.031
I'm gonna kick your ass off the
face of this fucking planet!

27:01.504 --> 27:04.472
- Where is she?
- Yeah, yeah, upstairs to the left.

27:04.474 --> 27:07.575
I think I... I-I left it open,
maybe?

27:07.577 --> 27:10.378
Y'know, in the back.
In the back room.

27:10.913 --> 27:12.780
Yeah, upstairs to the left.

27:14.684 --> 27:17.785
She said... she said the...
the baby needed to eat...

27:18.755 --> 27:20.821
- ...with no mouth.
- What?!

27:21.624 --> 27:23.758
There was no mouth.

27:37.039 --> 27:39.140
Are you alright, ma'am?

28:04.934 --> 28:06.901
What hap... What happened?

28:08.104 --> 28:09.837
Holy shit.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.109
Keep her the fuck away from you!!

28:29.859 --> 28:31.625
Come on, man!

28:31.627 --> 28:32.960
Ah!!!

28:32.962 --> 28:35.029
Get her!

29:01.657 --> 29:05.025
- You fucking killed her, man.
- Shut up! - Oh...

29:05.027 --> 29:07.127
Oh, fuck, man...

29:07.129 --> 29:08.796
Fuck.

29:08.798 --> 29:11.866
Doris! Doris! Shooker's hurt!

29:11.868 --> 29:15.035
<i>I'm here, boss. You should
see what your father brought in.</i>

29:15.037 --> 29:16.904
<i>You're gonna shit Frisbees.</i>

29:18.274 --> 29:20.674
Hey, man... Fuck.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.776
You brought me here, man.

29:22.778 --> 29:25.546
Doris, I gotta bring Shooker
to the hospital.

29:25.548 --> 29:28.148
There was supposed to be
a fucking ambulance!

29:28.150 --> 29:30.150
I dropped that girl.

29:30.152 --> 29:32.720
I think I killed her!

29:35.224 --> 29:38.192
<i>Joss is coming over
in an ambulance.</i>

29:38.194 --> 29:39.960
<i>She's talking hysterical,
Chief.</i>

29:39.962 --> 29:41.729
About what?

29:42.598 --> 29:44.765
<i>She's saying...</i>

29:44.767 --> 29:47.034
<i>She's saying don't get bit,
Chief?</i>

29:47.036 --> 29:48.802
<i>Don't get bit.</i>

29:54.777 --> 29:56.644
Tell her I'll be right there.

29:57.813 --> 30:00.614
- Fuck, man!!
- Hold on!

30:10.960 --> 30:13.193
You can let me out here, boss.

30:13.195 --> 30:15.329
Stay put.

30:15.331 --> 30:17.031
We're gonna go get 'em.

30:44.660 --> 30:47.294
Traylor. We have to, Traylor.
He's coming back.

30:47.296 --> 30:49.363
He's coming back.
He's coming back.

30:49.365 --> 30:52.032
He's coming back.

30:52.034 --> 30:53.267
Hey!!

30:54.136 --> 30:56.003
Joseph's still in the back.

30:57.340 --> 31:00.174
The door's stuck!

31:00.176 --> 31:02.843
Charlie,
open the fucking door!

31:04.647 --> 31:07.247
Get the fuck out of here!

31:11.754 --> 31:14.021
Get the fuck off me,
you bitch!

31:14.023 --> 31:15.889
Ah!

31:46.118 --> 31:47.791
New chain.

32:11.375 --> 32:12.750
Just like the dog,

32:13.958 --> 32:15.041
Just like the fish,

32:15.958 --> 32:17.416
The dead

32:17.916 --> 32:20.916
are coming back to life.

33:47.476 --> 33:49.042
Subtle.

34:12.201 --> 34:14.935
Would you check this out?
Found a whole box of these,

34:14.937 --> 34:17.871
and this was the only one
that didn't have blood on it.

34:17.873 --> 34:22.009
Could probably swap a blow job for this.
It's cherry-flavoured.

34:22.011 --> 34:24.444
Fuck, you could get a blow job
from anyone.

34:24.446 --> 34:27.214
It's probably the last
cherry-flavoured powder in the world.

34:28.851 --> 34:30.217
I'm eating this.

34:33.022 --> 34:36.256
<i>Shooker's coming in with
Joseph, Charlie and three boat people.</i>

34:36.258 --> 34:38.025
<i>Everyone, behave.</i>

34:38.027 --> 34:41.228
- Oh, to you who are highly favoured.
- No shit.

34:42.097 --> 34:43.931
Hey, Doris,
that's my little brother,

34:43.933 --> 34:46.567
so I wouldn't harm a hair
on his head.

34:56.879 --> 34:59.046
Three more mouths to feed.
Yay.

34:59.048 --> 35:01.081
Ah, good grief, Charlie Brown.

35:01.083 --> 35:04.251
We know the girl; this guy
and his kid are stragglers.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.954
Hey, I know you too.

35:07.923 --> 35:11.325
We've got two more mouths to feed.
The girl's sick.

35:12.895 --> 35:15.629
Welcome
to our pallet-tive care.

35:15.631 --> 35:17.364
Put her down.

35:17.366 --> 35:21.068
What's going on here?
I haven't done anything wrong.

35:21.070 --> 35:24.404
When you're bring in your sick
here, what's right about it?

35:24.406 --> 35:26.940
My little girl got injured,
that's all.

35:26.942 --> 35:29.643
She needs help. I was told
I could get help here.

35:29.645 --> 35:31.278
Who told you?

35:42.224 --> 35:44.424
Oh, wait a minute.

35:44.426 --> 35:47.628
We could just go back and leave or
use one of the boats. We don't need...

35:47.630 --> 35:50.197
- Hey!
- Charlie, we barely know this guy.

35:50.199 --> 35:51.965
Fuck, Lysol, settle down.

35:51.967 --> 35:55.535
Fuck, you just said it, man.
You don't know this guy.

35:56.305 --> 35:58.171
How do you know
this fuckin' townie

35:58.173 --> 36:00.307
didn't come here
with this refugee Pollyanna act

36:00.309 --> 36:03.577
to plant this infected bitch
right on our doorstep?!

36:04.647 --> 36:08.148
- Here, you brought her here.
- What? - Take this knife,

36:08.150 --> 36:11.018
slide it in her ear
and stir it around.

36:13.322 --> 36:15.555
Do you know what we had to do
to get here?!

36:15.557 --> 36:18.091
No, and I don't give a fuck,
either!

36:18.093 --> 36:20.661
You do it up,
or I'll do it for you!

36:20.663 --> 36:22.396
Jesus.

36:23.332 --> 36:26.199
What if my baby's born sick?
You gonna shoot us too?

36:26.201 --> 36:28.335
I do what I have to do.

36:28.337 --> 36:29.670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, boys.

36:29.672 --> 36:31.672
You broke my dipstick.
You owe me a blow job!

36:31.674 --> 36:33.707
Point that gun at Charlie
again, I'll fuckin' kill you!

36:33.709 --> 36:35.976
Joseph! Alan!

36:35.978 --> 36:38.679
What the fuck are you doing?

36:39.581 --> 36:42.249
Just checking for bites
like you told us to.

36:42.251 --> 36:45.619
Are you gonna fucking open up
the floodgates and let them stay?

36:46.555 --> 36:48.388
Look at you.

36:49.158 --> 36:51.959
Look at all of you.
Get your fuckin' shit together!

36:53.362 --> 36:55.629
What are you doing?

36:55.631 --> 36:58.065
How the fuck do you even keep
arranging this?

36:58.067 --> 37:00.600
We're supposed to be helping people.
That's what I'm doing.

37:00.602 --> 37:02.569
We're not supposed
to be doing anything.

37:02.571 --> 37:04.438
We're supposed to be surviving!

37:07.291 --> 37:08.333
How far gone?

37:09.166 --> 37:10.835
We're gonna have to kill her.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.080
What are you guys talking about?
Speak English.

37:13.461 --> 37:15.083
What about the other two?

37:15.916 --> 37:18.000
Joss can look at them.

37:19.666 --> 37:21.208
Just the girl.

37:21.623 --> 37:23.056
Speak English!!

37:27.663 --> 37:30.764
Your girl's been bit.
She can't come in here.

37:30.766 --> 37:34.101
She'll put everyone in danger.
You should've said something.

37:35.337 --> 37:37.604
I heard that you could cure
bites here.

37:37.606 --> 37:40.273
I should've been honest
about that upfront.

37:40.275 --> 37:42.676
But look, look, he's been bit!

37:44.113 --> 37:46.713
She stopped on her breathing.

37:53.789 --> 37:56.289
Everyone inside.

38:04.233 --> 38:06.566
You need to move away from her.

38:10.773 --> 38:12.439
Go inside.

38:13.275 --> 38:15.509
You're not gonna want
to see it come back.

38:16.678 --> 38:19.713
You're especially not gonna want
to see what he does with that axe.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.461
Gotta make them
take that shit down!

38:36.208 --> 38:39.791
I've never killed a child
before.

39:08.497 --> 39:10.730
It was the dogs
that got my family.

39:10.732 --> 39:14.301
I was sentimental about my dog.
Turns out,

39:14.303 --> 39:17.504
immune to the plague doesn't
mean immune to being eaten alive.

39:24.146 --> 39:27.447
Look, I get it, you're still
feeling bad about Karen,

39:27.449 --> 39:29.749
but look around you.

39:29.751 --> 39:32.319
Everyone here lost somebody.

39:32.321 --> 39:34.521
- Kyra.
- What?

39:37.392 --> 39:39.493
Her name was Kyra.

39:40.496 --> 39:43.530
ZED. That's just ZED,

39:43.532 --> 39:45.432
not some little girl.

39:45.434 --> 39:49.436
It's better to, you know,
not look at them as whatchamacallits,

39:49.438 --> 39:50.604
people.

39:51.673 --> 39:53.573
Are you fucking crazy?

39:53.575 --> 39:56.543
You can't bring that here!

40:02.518 --> 40:06.219
Go. Follow J and Charlie,
the pregnant lady,

40:06.221 --> 40:07.821
into the nurses' station.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.691
And don't forget,

40:11.693 --> 40:13.894
ain't nobody immune here
but us.

40:15.197 --> 40:16.563
So feel safe here.

40:22.704 --> 40:25.539
I'm just gonna ask
you a couple of questions, okay?

40:32.447 --> 40:34.714
So how long
were you out there for?

40:36.552 --> 40:38.285
I lost track of the time.

40:42.291 --> 40:44.958
What did you guys eat
while you were out there?

40:46.728 --> 40:48.461
Did you eat any salmon?

40:53.335 --> 40:54.701
Did you eat any dog?

40:55.804 --> 40:57.470
Anything else?

40:59.474 --> 41:02.642
Are you asking me
if I had to eat people?

41:05.614 --> 41:08.448
Has anyone ever answered yes
to that?

41:08.450 --> 41:09.783
Well, what's your answer?

41:14.456 --> 41:15.622
No.

41:16.425 --> 41:19.726
I haven't eaten any people
or dogs...

41:19.728 --> 41:21.928
or fucking anything!

41:21.930 --> 41:24.497
- Settle down.
- Do you have a bathroom?

41:27.936 --> 41:30.704
One more question.
It's a big one.

41:32.574 --> 41:34.341
Did you get bit?

41:40.482 --> 41:41.848
No.

42:02.671 --> 42:04.004
Hello?

42:12.781 --> 42:14.381
Who's there?

42:40.509 --> 42:42.309
Everything is blocked off.

42:42.311 --> 42:45.945
We got four-man teams
at every blockade.

42:46.581 --> 42:50.884
The roads coming in off of 132,
ain't nothing really to worry about.

42:50.886 --> 42:54.587
<i>Stragglers still stumbling in from
some of the podunk towns on the island.</i>

42:54.589 --> 42:56.823
<i>Pretty old and mangled.
Don't move as fast,</i>

42:56.825 --> 42:58.892
<i>so they've been
pickin' them off easy.</i>

43:00.929 --> 43:03.863
<i>Bodies are starting to pile up
faster than we can bury 'em,</i>

43:03.865 --> 43:07.600
<i>so we might have to spark up those
pyres again, regardless of who sees 'em.</i>

43:08.837 --> 43:11.805
<i>They were getting the same
problem on the bridge.</i>

43:11.807 --> 43:14.607
<i>Says it's been coming in
townie-side nonstop.</i>

43:15.744 --> 43:19.646
<i>We're wasting our ammo trying to keep
them from ramping up the blockade.</i>

43:19.648 --> 43:22.682
<i>Bumper found a way around that
without having to fire a single shot,</i>

43:22.684 --> 43:24.617
<i>or mop up a single body.</i>

43:39.835 --> 43:43.670
<i>The bigger problem than the dead-walking-around
townies, is the live breathing ones.</i>

43:43.672 --> 43:45.772
<i>They're coming across
in almost the same numbers.</i>

43:45.774 --> 43:47.907
<i>Some people in Red Crow
don't like it,</i>

43:47.909 --> 43:51.010
<i>but we got to do right
by survivors.</i>

43:51.012 --> 43:53.813
We've been housing all the
intakes here at the hall.

43:55.150 --> 43:57.884
We've been keeping the boats
that have been coming in,

43:57.886 --> 43:59.819
tied up
by the old man's shanty.

43:59.821 --> 44:02.689
If something happens here,
we get separated,

44:02.691 --> 44:04.591
we meet up at the church.

44:05.460 --> 44:07.861
We got enough space
between here and there

44:07.863 --> 44:10.797
to buy us time
to get on those boats.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
We wait this thing out
till winter.

44:14.803 --> 44:19.139
Can hit the towns, clean out the
ZEDzicles and find any other survivors.

44:21.476 --> 44:25.578
Keep reminding people...
moose and deer are clean,

44:25.580 --> 44:28.148
and anything out of the water
is bad meat.

44:28.150 --> 44:31.818
We hunt and trap for food.
That mountain water's clean.

44:32.821 --> 44:35.989
That leaves one thing: gas.

44:37.993 --> 44:40.059
Only thing left
is that gas station

44:40.061 --> 44:43.129
that the Muppets own
on the rez side of 132.

44:43.131 --> 44:46.900
Burner said there's a whole reservoir
there that we haven't even tapped yet.

44:46.902 --> 44:49.903
Shooker's been keeping an eye
on things for us.

44:49.905 --> 44:52.105
They've been bringing girls
up there.

44:52.107 --> 44:56.075
Papa Muppet's been tellin' them if they
give him head, they're gonna be immune.

44:56.912 --> 44:59.446
Either way,
we gotta clean 'em out.

45:02.684 --> 45:06.052
It's... the guy that came
with the girl, Chief.

45:06.054 --> 45:08.455
He killed himself.

45:09.791 --> 45:10.924
Fuck.

45:17.933 --> 45:22.168
Jesus, he couldn't
shoot himself like a normal person.

45:22.170 --> 45:24.504
You need a hand, Chief?

45:32.948 --> 45:36.049
I think going on the run has
made your brother even more mental.

45:38.787 --> 45:42.689
I used to think it was because my
dad had him when he was, like, young.

45:44.559 --> 45:46.493
And was just never
in the picture.

45:46.495 --> 45:48.061
The way his mom died
didn't help.

45:49.664 --> 45:52.165
Sent him to foster care,
and who knows what happened there?

45:53.735 --> 45:56.236
He left an Alan
and came back a Lysol.

45:56.238 --> 45:58.104
Yeah, I forgot
that was his mom.

45:59.574 --> 46:02.709
Gave him a pass
on so much fucking nonsense.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.613
"You still have a mom."

46:07.015 --> 46:09.782
Do you know how many times
he said that shit to me?

46:10.852 --> 46:13.286
It has to stop some time.
You can't just be an asshole.

46:13.288 --> 46:15.054
Yeah, fuck him, then.

46:15.056 --> 46:16.923
But either way...

46:16.925 --> 46:18.791
he was right.

46:20.595 --> 46:21.928
Yeah, he's right.

46:23.899 --> 46:25.899
If that girl flipped
five minutes sooner...

46:25.901 --> 46:28.167
I know it's not the sick little
girls that I'm worried about.

46:28.169 --> 46:30.270
Do you know what we have here,
man?

46:30.272 --> 46:32.839
This might be the last place on
the planet that isn't overrun.

46:32.841 --> 46:35.642
I know. I know, I know.

46:35.911 --> 46:38.645
Then what are you doing?
I'm straight up asking you:

46:38.647 --> 46:40.580
Help me understand
what are you doing?

46:40.582 --> 46:42.649
People look at me here...

46:46.888 --> 46:48.288
...like...

46:51.259 --> 46:53.960
...like my vagina's
Pandora's box.

47:01.603 --> 47:03.136
I have nightmares, Joseph.

47:05.006 --> 47:07.674
This baby eating me
from the inside out.

47:09.945 --> 47:11.978
You're immune, I'm not.

47:12.747 --> 47:14.847
What if this baby isn't either?

47:14.849 --> 47:17.984
I mean, what if it just decides
to eat its way out?

47:19.654 --> 47:22.755
Charlie, my mom's watching you
every day.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.158
People have been doing this shit
since monkeys got off their knuckles.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.260
It's not about the pregnancy,
dumbass.

47:27.262 --> 47:30.363
It's about sitting here and just
waiting for something to happen,

47:30.365 --> 47:33.900
because don't you feel it?
Something's gonna happen.

47:34.669 --> 47:38.371
I trust my mother. She says it's healthy.
It has a healthy heartbeat.

47:38.373 --> 47:40.773
Shooker's baby?

47:40.775 --> 47:43.176
I didn't say that.

47:43.178 --> 47:46.846
Look, Shooker's woman was
a dope addict and so was he.

47:46.848 --> 47:48.982
I didn't want this.

47:48.984 --> 47:50.383
I know.

47:50.385 --> 47:55.188
- But you said it a million times when you were at the hospital.
- No, to fight with you.

47:56.992 --> 47:59.192
Have you thought of any names?

48:02.864 --> 48:05.031
No. Not really.

48:06.034 --> 48:07.367
You?

48:10.071 --> 48:11.304
No.

48:13.008 --> 48:15.041
You don't name things
that eat you.

48:21.049 --> 48:22.982
Jesus, Charlie.

48:26.021 --> 48:28.154
I love you.

48:53.882 --> 48:55.248
He clipped me.

48:57.352 --> 48:59.752
Right.
Well, take your shirt off,

48:59.754 --> 49:01.087
let me have a look.

49:05.026 --> 49:06.426
Here, sit.

49:19.441 --> 49:21.207
Ah.

49:21.209 --> 49:23.776
Ah...

49:23.778 --> 49:25.945
Yeah. Ahem.

49:25.947 --> 49:27.880
You're gonna need stitches.

49:28.950 --> 49:33.152
I don't have any lidocaine, so you're
just gonna have to grit your teeth.

49:33.154 --> 49:35.988
Got any beer?

49:42.897 --> 49:44.464
You did so good by him.

49:47.802 --> 49:50.303
Yeah, well...
you're in there too.

49:52.440 --> 49:56.476
Yeah, the part that gets drunk
and takes shits off of bridges.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.014
Look... he's loyal.

50:04.119 --> 50:06.018
And he's smart.

50:06.988 --> 50:08.321
He's a fighter.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.159
And maybe he didn't split
the atom, but...

50:14.129 --> 50:16.295
...he survived
the end of the world.

50:33.416 --> 50:35.416
You're your father's son,

50:37.958 --> 50:39.750
so is Joseph.

50:49.297 --> 50:50.897
Thank you.

51:04.012 --> 51:06.412
These are all the 302s
I could rustle up.

51:06.414 --> 51:09.148
James got more,
but I can't find her drunk ass.

51:09.150 --> 51:11.284
I don't plan on using 'em.

51:11.286 --> 51:13.820
You should've ran that fool off
the reserve when he was alive.

51:14.956 --> 51:17.190
I thought Rob Muppet
was from here.

51:17.192 --> 51:19.091
Everyone thinks that.

51:19.093 --> 51:20.526
But that family's
not from Red Crow.

51:20.528 --> 51:23.229
Speaking of which,
what about this place?

51:23.231 --> 51:25.565
Some of these fuckers
ain't local.

51:25.567 --> 51:29.235
Never seen a brown person since
their grandparents owned one.

51:29.237 --> 51:31.470
And they outnumber us too.

51:31.472 --> 51:33.272
How long
before it comes to pass

51:33.274 --> 51:36.475
they get tired of being herded
by a bunch of Indians?

51:39.314 --> 51:41.146
We got all their guns.

51:41.148 --> 51:42.981
And they're all too civilized to shit
anyplace that doesn't have a door.

51:42.984 --> 51:44.951
What the fuck are they gonna do?

51:44.953 --> 51:46.619
What the fuck
are they gonna to do?

51:46.621 --> 51:49.555
One of them could come in here
and infect this entire camp!

51:49.557 --> 51:53.893
It takes one, Traylor! And Joseph's
pet townie keeps dragging them in here.

51:53.895 --> 51:57.630
- Hey, fuck you.
- Every one of these motherfuckers is a time bomb!

51:57.632 --> 52:01.067
That's why we have a wall.
Anyone flips in here,

52:01.069 --> 52:03.402
this place
is a fucking shooting gallery.

52:03.404 --> 52:05.471
With fucking Peeky
and Maynard up there,

52:05.473 --> 52:08.641
they couldn't hit water
if they fell out of a boat!

52:09.911 --> 52:11.444
There's about, what,
100 people here?

52:11.446 --> 52:13.880
That's three-plus Gs for every
swinging dick we have!

52:13.882 --> 52:15.281
We don't have enough bullets,
man!

52:15.283 --> 52:17.884
You don't have to reload
a sword.

52:19.254 --> 52:20.987
Fuck this shit.

52:20.989 --> 52:23.923
If you say the rez is clean,
so be it.

52:24.425 --> 52:28.361
It's on you... when these bingo
bunnies go south of cheese.

52:31.432 --> 52:34.433
Get word round, J,
the rez is clean,

52:34.435 --> 52:36.269
we got celebratin' to do.

52:36.271 --> 52:38.304
We party at my place!

52:38.306 --> 52:41.007
I'm taking this gas
for my fucking car!

52:42.677 --> 52:44.644
- Hey!
- Let him go.

52:44.646 --> 52:47.246
- Why?
- Because he's not wrong.

52:51.319 --> 52:53.653
Follow him.
Don't let it get out of hand.

52:53.655 --> 52:55.321
Alright, Dad.

52:56.591 --> 53:00.026
Dad?
It's a brave new world.

53:13.441 --> 53:15.341
Leave them to their parties.

53:16.344 --> 53:19.145
They have their recreation,
and we have ours.

54:24.112 --> 54:25.745
Oh, hey.

54:27.115 --> 54:30.182
Ah... listen,
I'm glad you came, man.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.351
I wanted to tell you
that I shouldn't have

54:32.353 --> 54:34.286
put that gun on your lady
this morning.

54:36.758 --> 54:39.158
I want to say...

54:39.160 --> 54:42.695
your punching me in the face,
just means you're gonna be a good father.

54:44.532 --> 54:46.298
That's the weed talking.

54:49.704 --> 54:51.537
It is, but it isn't.

54:54.142 --> 54:55.641
I felt shitty about it, man.

54:57.211 --> 55:00.513
The thing is, it's just more
about Dad and our bullshit.

55:01.282 --> 55:03.249
It's never gonna change.

55:03.251 --> 55:05.084
It can change.

55:05.086 --> 55:08.087
You don't have to be
a trash dad, Joey.

55:08.089 --> 55:10.089
That shit is optional.

55:10.091 --> 55:12.725
And why do you choose
to be a fucking asshole?

55:12.727 --> 55:16.162
Gimme my fucking joint back.

55:18.499 --> 55:22.535
Did it ever fuckin' dawn on you
that I'm not someone to look up to?

55:22.537 --> 55:25.805
That if you have to get arrested
to spend time with somebody...

55:27.241 --> 55:28.841
...they're just fucking
worthless.

55:31.712 --> 55:34.413
I'm not an asshole
to impress you, Joseph.

55:34.749 --> 55:36.515
I'm just an asshole.

55:44.125 --> 55:45.491
Sad.

55:46.461 --> 55:48.828
Yeah, when you find out
family ain't shit.

55:51.599 --> 55:53.732
I don't think you're shit.

55:57.405 --> 55:58.804
Give it time.

56:03.344 --> 56:05.377
- Whoa!
- Yeah, ah-ha.

56:07.648 --> 56:09.682
This is the last of it.

56:09.684 --> 56:12.251
My man.

56:12.253 --> 56:13.519
Alright.

56:14.822 --> 56:16.522
We're square.

56:18.292 --> 56:21.193
Remember that night before Z day?

56:21.195 --> 56:25.498
A bunch of us got arrested for getting
in a fight down at the Fish Mitten?

56:25.500 --> 56:28.534
It was because
of that chick right there.

56:33.307 --> 56:34.707
Anyway...

56:35.676 --> 56:38.544
...her boyfriend has
a stripper's ass in his face.

56:39.747 --> 56:41.480
Lilith's pissed.

56:42.884 --> 56:46.485
So she is looking
for some payback attention.

56:46.487 --> 56:48.554
And she's drunk enough that...

56:49.357 --> 56:51.690
...she'd be willing to get it
from anyone, man.

56:51.692 --> 56:53.259
Anyone.

56:58.699 --> 57:00.432
Long story short...

57:01.402 --> 57:02.835
I get her home,

57:02.837 --> 57:06.572
and I'm eating her out
and she's gushing, right?

57:06.574 --> 57:08.874
Fucking details
you can spare me, man.

57:08.876 --> 57:11.377
Fucking prig here
all of a sudden.

57:11.879 --> 57:13.879
So the phone rings.

57:13.881 --> 57:17.449
And it's Moon from the club,
saying the boys just got arrested

57:17.451 --> 57:19.885
for fighting this chick's
boyfriend and his buddies.

57:19.887 --> 57:22.288
So I forget about the girl.

57:22.290 --> 57:25.357
I head straight down
to the police station.

57:38.606 --> 57:41.740
<i>I'm not even halfway through
the door before I get arrested.</i>

57:41.742 --> 57:43.442
What for?

57:43.444 --> 57:45.244
Fighting.

57:46.447 --> 57:48.581
- <i>And Shamu is, like:</i>
- If you weren't fighting,

57:48.583 --> 57:50.716
- then why is your face all bloody?
- <i>"If you weren't fighting,</i>

57:50.718 --> 57:53.252
<i>how come your face
is all bloody?"</i>

57:53.254 --> 57:54.653
What?

57:55.223 --> 57:56.989
- Come on, loser.
- Hey, I wasn't fighting!

57:56.991 --> 57:59.425
What are you doing?!
This is bullshit, dude!

58:02.763 --> 58:06.432
That's the most fucked-up,
repugnant shit I've ever heard.

58:08.869 --> 58:12.605
At my age, you done it
on purpose at least once.

58:14.909 --> 58:17.276
If he dies by mistake.

58:23.317 --> 58:25.718
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

58:28.489 --> 58:29.822
Mm.

58:30.524 --> 58:32.858
Shit.

58:32.860 --> 58:36.428
Hey, Lilith! Lilith.

58:46.340 --> 58:47.740
The earth is an animal.

58:48.976 --> 58:50.843
Living and breathing.

58:53.041 --> 58:57.750
White men don't understand this.

59:01.756 --> 59:04.857
That's why the dead
keep coming back to life.

59:07.361 --> 59:08.761
Not because of God.

59:12.933 --> 59:16.368
Because this planet we're on
is so sick of our shit.

59:20.641 --> 59:24.410
This old, tired, angry animal...

59:24.945 --> 59:27.579
...turned these stupid
fucking white men

59:27.581 --> 59:30.082
into something
she can use again:

59:30.084 --> 59:31.784
fertilizer.

59:31.786 --> 59:34.320
Lysol, what the fuck?

59:34.322 --> 59:36.588
Don't let her finish.

59:54.942 --> 59:56.742
Who says we're immune?

59:57.875 --> 1:00:02.875
Maybe the earth just forgot
about us.

1:00:24.375 --> 1:00:27.166
How many did you say there was
in there again?

1:00:28.042 --> 1:00:30.943
More than 10.
Twelve or fifteen, counting the girls.

1:00:36.583 --> 1:00:39.458
We're using shotguns?

1:00:40.755 --> 1:00:43.122
Traylor is. We're inside.

1:00:43.724 --> 1:00:45.958
No fun in there with shotguns.

1:01:52.793 --> 1:01:55.861
Don't let any of them get out.

1:02:52.253 --> 1:02:54.152
Hey.

1:02:54.154 --> 1:02:55.988
A little fucking warning.

1:02:56.625 --> 1:02:58.125
Look out.

1:03:06.166 --> 1:03:08.634
Whew!

1:03:15.943 --> 1:03:17.276
Gisigu?

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:30.166
How many did you get?

1:03:31.916 --> 1:03:33.666
Four.

1:03:36.030 --> 1:03:39.665
So there could be as many
as six or seven left in here?

1:03:40.458 --> 1:03:44.333
Maybe ten.

1:03:45.673 --> 1:03:48.574
Fuck.

1:03:56.617 --> 1:03:58.250
Check if that genny works.

1:03:58.252 --> 1:04:01.153
You throw another G at me,
I want to see it coming.

1:04:33.821 --> 1:04:35.053
ZED?

1:04:37.257 --> 1:04:39.725
Zed dead.

1:04:53.173 --> 1:04:54.940
Fuck you.

1:04:55.709 --> 1:04:57.075
Fuck.

1:04:57.077 --> 1:04:58.377
Joseph!

1:05:03.150 --> 1:05:05.717
What the fuck's going on here,
man?

1:05:05.719 --> 1:05:07.919
- Joseph.
- Why didn't we kill that G?

1:05:07.921 --> 1:05:10.322
No, you gotta get someone
to sound the alarm.

1:05:11.191 --> 1:05:13.725
You gotta get
as many people as you can.

1:05:13.727 --> 1:05:16.662
- You get them in that hall!
- Why did we bring that here?

1:05:16.664 --> 1:05:19.398
It's obvious now:
it's us or them.

1:05:20.401 --> 1:05:22.334
Have you fucking lost it, man?

1:05:23.370 --> 1:05:25.871
There is no us or them,
there's only us.

1:05:25.873 --> 1:05:27.939
- No.
- Okay? Look.

1:05:27.941 --> 1:05:31.810
Just come downstairs, we can fix...
we can fix you up.

1:05:31.812 --> 1:05:33.912
The whole world's
fucking dead, man.

1:05:33.914 --> 1:05:35.681
You still have a family,
though.

1:05:35.683 --> 1:05:38.083
Okay? This can all stop.

1:05:38.719 --> 1:05:40.419
Just... just stop.

1:05:41.155 --> 1:05:42.721
Just stop.

1:05:43.757 --> 1:05:46.191
I'm sorry.

1:05:46.193 --> 1:05:47.793
I'm sorry.

1:05:48.228 --> 1:05:50.195
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:05:50.197 --> 1:05:52.964
It's okay. It's ok...

1:06:01.475 --> 1:06:03.175
Ah, I have no family.

1:06:13.220 --> 1:06:15.020
Get her!

1:06:26.967 --> 1:06:30.001
You're gonna get all those dicks
for me, okay?

1:06:40.914 --> 1:06:42.981
Run!

1:06:42.983 --> 1:06:45.383
Run!!!
Clear out!

1:06:45.385 --> 1:06:48.153
Run now!!
Run!

1:07:00.033 --> 1:07:01.867
What were you saying to her?

1:07:03.370 --> 1:07:05.237
I was telling her a story.

1:07:06.140 --> 1:07:07.873
She was scared.

1:07:10.244 --> 1:07:12.878
We used to tell it to Joseph,
that story.

1:07:13.413 --> 1:07:15.547
It's about his grandfather.

1:07:18.852 --> 1:07:20.252
I'm scared, Joss.

1:07:21.321 --> 1:07:23.155
We're all here.

1:07:23.157 --> 1:07:24.923
This place is safe.

1:07:27.294 --> 1:07:29.060
Did you hear that?

1:07:34.501 --> 1:07:36.501
Joseph!

1:07:36.503 --> 1:07:39.104
Joseph.

1:07:39.106 --> 1:07:40.539
What happened?

1:07:40.541 --> 1:07:42.474
Lysol.

1:07:56.924 --> 1:07:58.456
Everyone stay calm.

1:07:58.458 --> 1:08:00.892
There's the other exit.

1:08:03.831 --> 1:08:05.397
Wait!

1:08:20.113 --> 1:08:22.414
Can we panic now?

1:08:45.572 --> 1:08:48.073
We're here.

1:08:48.075 --> 1:08:51.443
<i>I'm in the basement with Charlie,
Joseph and eight other survivors.</i>

1:08:51.445 --> 1:08:53.912
<i>I don't think
anyone else made it.</i>

1:08:53.914 --> 1:08:56.648
What was the headcount
up to last week?

1:08:56.650 --> 1:08:58.884
100, 150 townies.

1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:01.987
Fuck.

1:09:03.123 --> 1:09:04.456
Can your people move?

1:09:04.458 --> 1:09:06.157
<i>Not all of them.</i>

1:09:08.262 --> 1:09:10.262
Hold tight,
we're coming to get you.

1:09:10.264 --> 1:09:12.564
<i>Traylor, hurry the fuck up.</i>

1:09:15.903 --> 1:09:17.302
How you want to do this?

1:09:19.006 --> 1:09:20.906
Who's got the most meat
on 'em?

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:28.500
No problem.

1:09:37.024 --> 1:09:39.024
Oh...

1:09:40.093 --> 1:09:41.326
It's bad.

1:09:42.125 --> 1:09:43.458
Get on with it.

1:09:49.636 --> 1:09:51.670
You ready?

1:11:03.443 --> 1:11:05.410
That'll buy us some time,

1:11:05.412 --> 1:11:08.213
but there's bound
to be more inside.

1:11:10.417 --> 1:11:12.384
Get the truck.

1:11:12.386 --> 1:11:14.652
Don't use your gun
unless you have to.

1:12:01.735 --> 1:12:04.469
Circle around,
keep the engine running.

1:12:41.408 --> 1:12:43.608
Where the fuck were you?!

1:12:43.610 --> 1:12:46.177
- Where's Charlie?
- What happened to you?

1:12:46.179 --> 1:12:49.314
Where's Charlie? Get Charlie.
Dad, Dad, get Charlie.

1:12:49.316 --> 1:12:51.549
Get Charlie.
Get Charlie, get Charlie.

1:12:51.551 --> 1:12:55.787
There's a truck outside!
You want to live?! Get on it!

1:12:55.789 --> 1:12:58.490
Let's go. Let's go.

1:13:07.434 --> 1:13:09.601
- Move your ass!
- Alright, let's go.

1:13:09.603 --> 1:13:11.669
Come on. Come on.
Move, move!

1:13:11.671 --> 1:13:14.272
I am not getting on
without you!

1:13:22.349 --> 1:13:24.682
Shooker! Move!

1:13:26.753 --> 1:13:28.920
Go!!

1:13:52.479 --> 1:13:55.480
This is some fucking rescue.

1:13:55.482 --> 1:13:59.250
This door is not gonna hold.
You're gonna have to make a run for it.

1:13:59.252 --> 1:14:01.319
- A run for it?
- You have no choice!

1:14:01.688 --> 1:14:04.245
And if I don't make it
out of here...

1:14:04.247 --> 1:14:08.583
I want you to tell my grandchild
big stories about me.

1:14:11.765 --> 1:14:14.866
On the count of three... run!

1:14:19.539 --> 1:14:21.272
Go!!

1:15:31.011 --> 1:15:34.579
Now, you're gonna
say it exactly like I told you.

1:15:35.015 --> 1:15:36.681
No cute stuff.

1:15:42.489 --> 1:15:43.888
Traylor...

1:15:45.458 --> 1:15:47.425
<i>...they're killing people
in the church.</i>

1:15:50.430 --> 1:15:52.630
<i>Normal... real people.</i>

1:15:57.671 --> 1:16:00.538
James and Moon
are just killin' 'em.

1:16:00.540 --> 1:16:02.407
And I'm fucking locked up here.

1:16:03.543 --> 1:16:05.310
Dammit.

1:16:11.551 --> 1:16:13.985
I'm coming to get you.

1:16:18.825 --> 1:16:20.625
Thank you.

1:16:20.627 --> 1:16:21.993
See you around.

1:16:21.995 --> 1:16:23.594
Good luck.

1:17:10.677 --> 1:17:12.477
Shit!

1:17:15.648 --> 1:17:18.416
Just breathe.
They'll be back soon.

1:17:18.418 --> 1:17:20.685

of all these fucking...

1:18:47.674 --> 1:18:50.475
...dependents once and for all!

1:18:56.216 --> 1:18:59.050
Meet back up here
at the church if...

1:19:00.153 --> 1:19:01.953
...it makes an outbreak.

1:19:08.161 --> 1:19:11.262
Yeah, these fuckers come
to the buffet,

1:19:11.264 --> 1:19:13.030
then we...

1:19:13.032 --> 1:19:16.167
torch the fuck out of 'em
by mid-meal.

1:19:20.573 --> 1:19:23.508
And that's fucking all of you!

1:19:25.778 --> 1:19:28.613
After all this,
that's all you fuckers.

1:19:29.649 --> 1:19:31.282
We even...

1:19:31.284 --> 1:19:33.851
got that bitch
up in the belfry.

1:19:37.056 --> 1:19:40.558
You have to hand it to Lysol.

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.160
Fucking, you know,

1:19:43.162 --> 1:19:46.697
crazier than a shithouse rat,

1:19:46.699 --> 1:19:50.935
but all in all,
he has it pretty good.

1:20:02.882 --> 1:20:05.650
Get Doris, boy.

1:20:06.185 --> 1:20:09.020
You're gonna tell me
where that fucking coward is?

1:20:16.729 --> 1:20:19.864
Just breathe.

1:20:19.866 --> 1:20:21.666
- Just breathe.
- Ow!

1:20:22.802 --> 1:20:24.835
It's okay. It's okay.

1:20:27.006 --> 1:20:29.140
Behind you!

1:20:44.691 --> 1:20:46.123
Then there was one.

1:20:46.125 --> 1:20:48.726
- Stop!
- Keep fucking around,

1:20:48.728 --> 1:20:51.996
I put a bullet right in
her fucking head.

1:21:04.644 --> 1:21:06.611
Alan...

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:09.347
We can still undo this.

1:21:10.216 --> 1:21:13.284
No, this goes back
so much further than that!

1:21:15.121 --> 1:21:16.887
Fucking Sir Lancelot!

1:21:19.993 --> 1:21:21.959
Come on!

1:21:22.829 --> 1:21:24.195
Come on.

1:21:24.197 --> 1:21:25.963
Ah!

1:21:32.872 --> 1:21:34.705
You know, Joss,

1:21:34.707 --> 1:21:38.009
I wasn't the one who brought
these people here.

1:21:38.645 --> 1:21:42.680
I didn't have a chick bringing
plagued-up opies into the flock.

1:21:42.682 --> 1:21:44.048
Fuck you!

1:21:45.151 --> 1:21:48.719
Alan...
I know how you feel.

1:21:48.721 --> 1:21:52.390
There was a time when I wanted
to run that compound down myself.

1:21:52.392 --> 1:21:55.192
But these are real people.

1:21:58.197 --> 1:22:00.965
Don't you open
that fucking trunk!!

1:22:01.834 --> 1:22:04.068
What are youse gonna do to me?

1:22:25.058 --> 1:22:27.091
Don't.

1:22:32.031 --> 1:22:35.266
Joseph... I've been bit.

1:23:04.897 --> 1:23:06.764
Y'know...

1:23:06.766 --> 1:23:10.134
when you have some time to sit and
think, you'll thank me.

1:23:10.903 --> 1:23:12.737
Set you all free!

1:23:24.117 --> 1:23:25.483
Now.

1:23:34.861 --> 1:23:37.795
A question... Joseph...

1:23:39.198 --> 1:23:40.931
Between brothers.

1:23:40.933 --> 1:23:46.470
You really think that... that sick chick
made it in the Muppet house by accident?

1:23:47.540 --> 1:23:49.874
Where do you think
I got the idea?

1:24:05.525 --> 1:24:07.258
I'm sorry.

1:25:50.196 --> 1:25:53.130
Jesus, God, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

1:25:53.132 --> 1:25:54.632
We're not gonna die here.

1:25:55.601 --> 1:25:57.167
Listen.

1:26:01.507 --> 1:26:04.275
- What are we gonna do, swim?!
- Listen!

1:26:19.492 --> 1:26:22.026
Where the fuck have you been?

1:26:22.028 --> 1:26:25.596
- They wouldn't let me wait. I heard shots, so I came.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1:26:29.435 --> 1:26:32.002
Oh, shit.

1:26:32.004 --> 1:26:33.437
Okay. Okay.

1:26:33.439 --> 1:26:35.339
It'll be okay. I got you.

1:26:35.341 --> 1:26:37.942
Let's go,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1:26:37.944 --> 1:26:40.311
You got her?

1:26:40.313 --> 1:26:42.313
Come on, breathe. Yeah.

1:26:46.986 --> 1:26:48.719
We need to go.

1:26:48.721 --> 1:26:51.655
Grandpa... we need to go.

1:26:53.993 --> 1:26:56.527
I'm not leaving this land
again.

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:07.375
Don't look back here.

1:29:34.166 --> 1:29:41.291
None of you are getting past
this line.

1:29:49.735 --> 1:29:51.668
You can do it.
Just push.

1:29:55.307 --> 1:29:58.308
Come on, push. Come on, push.

1:29:58.310 --> 1:30:01.912
Charlie, you can do this.
You can do this. Push.

1:30:07.686 --> 1:30:10.621
Come on, just push, Charlie.
You're almost there.

1:30:10.623 --> 1:30:13.390
You don't know
how much this hurts.

1:30:13.392 --> 1:30:15.492
I do, I do.
Come on, just push.

1:30:17.663 --> 1:30:20.264
- Just push. Just push.
- Alright, yeah. You're gonna have to push.

1:30:20.266 --> 1:30:21.932
Otherwise I'm gonna
have to cut you, okay?

1:30:26.672 --> 1:30:29.439
You're doing so good, come on.
Push, push.

1:30:29.441 --> 1:30:31.575
You're doing really great.
Come on.

1:30:33.812 --> 1:30:36.246
Almost there.

1:30:36.248 --> 1:30:39.249
It's okay. I love you so much.

1:31:19.291 --> 1:31:21.625
Is it too late?

1:31:28.467 --> 1:31:29.800
It's a little girl.

1:31:31.503 --> 1:31:32.970
The gun?

1:31:39.745 --> 1:31:41.478
Do you want to hold her?

1:31:43.482 --> 1:31:45.749
No. I've been bitten.

1:31:45.751 --> 1:31:47.684
I'm sick, I can feel it.

1:31:50.022 --> 1:31:51.755
She can't get sick.

1:31:51.757 --> 1:31:53.390
It's okay.

1:32:08.007 --> 1:32:09.673
Thank you.

1:32:11.043 --> 1:32:12.743
Thank you so much.

1:32:18.417 --> 1:32:19.850
Take her back.

1:32:19.852 --> 1:32:25.389
- Charlie, you can hold her.
- No, I don't wanna hurt her. Take her back.

1:32:38.437 --> 1:32:40.704
- She's gonna be okay.
- Hmm.

1:32:42.975 --> 1:32:45.876
- Maybe you'll be too.
- No, I won't.

1:32:46.979 --> 1:32:49.046
Joseph...

1:32:49.048 --> 1:32:51.081
we have to end this.

1:32:51.083 --> 1:32:54.918
Don't let me turn into one of
those dead people. Look at her.

1:32:56.522 --> 1:32:57.788
Hey.

1:32:59.358 --> 1:33:00.724
We did it.

1:33:03.095 --> 1:33:04.594
Love her.

1:33:05.964 --> 1:33:07.431
Love her.
