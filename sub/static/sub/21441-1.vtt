01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Sweetheart!

01:23.331 --> 01:24.331
Mas chicken?

01:26.331 --> 01:29.326
Con salsa. I love the sauce.

01:29.331 --> 01:32.331
They're heating it up.
I'll bring it to you.

02:00.331 --> 02:01.331
Let's go! Let's go!

02:26.227 --> 02:29.226
Hello, Jason? You hear me?

02:29.330 --> 02:31.329
No, please!

02:31.647 --> 02:33.647
Who you talk to?

02:35.647 --> 02:36.647
Tell me who you talk to.

02:37.647 --> 02:39.642
Nobody!

02:39.647 --> 02:41.642
Nobody, okay.

02:41.647 --> 02:44.642
You wag your fucking
tongue, I cut it off.

02:44.647 --> 02:46.642
Give it to your friend at the bank,

02:46.647 --> 02:48.642
maybe he keep his mouth shut.

02:48.647 --> 02:50.642
- No! No!
- Say.

03:01.647 --> 03:03.642
Thank you, sweetheart.

03:03.647 --> 03:06.642
You treat a lady so nice.

03:36.647 --> 03:38.642
- You didn't like it.
- I did. I did, yeah.

03:38.647 --> 03:41.642
You didn't.

03:41.647 --> 03:43.642
How do you know? I
haven't said anything.

03:43.647 --> 03:44.647
That's how I know.

03:47.647 --> 03:48.642
Just didn't buy it.

03:48.647 --> 03:50.642
Which part?

03:50.647 --> 03:52.642
Forty guys in a motorcycle gang,

03:52.647 --> 03:54.642
and he just brings
'em all down? Come on.

03:54.647 --> 03:56.642
Well, you think it's too violent?

03:56.647 --> 03:59.642
The explosions, it
doesn't mean anything.

03:59.647 --> 04:01.642
After a while you don't even notice 'em.

04:01.647 --> 04:03.642
- Dad, it's in 3D.
- So?

04:03.647 --> 04:05.642
It's not supposed to mean anything.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.642
Remember we went to see Steve
McQueen in The Great Escape?

04:09.647 --> 04:11.642
Now that was real
motorcycles, no computers.

04:11.647 --> 04:13.642
You only like old movies.

04:13.647 --> 04:15.642
- That's not true.
- Yeah.

04:15.647 --> 04:16.642
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.642
- Hey.
- How was it?

04:18.647 --> 04:20.642
- Well, you know.
- Well, I liked it.

04:20.647 --> 04:22.642
All right. Jump in, kiddo.

04:22.647 --> 04:25.642
Hold on, is anybody hungry?

04:25.647 --> 04:27.642
I thought maybe we could
go to the Terrace Cafe.

04:27.647 --> 04:29.642
That's fancy.

04:29.647 --> 04:30.647
I'm feeling a bit fancy.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.642
I should get her home.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.647
I got you something.

04:37.647 --> 04:39.642
What is it?

04:39.647 --> 04:42.642
- Um...
- Mom, just open it.

04:42.647 --> 04:44.647
I want to know what's going on.

04:45.647 --> 04:46.647
Okay.

04:48.647 --> 04:50.647
As of today, it's been six months.

04:51.647 --> 04:52.647
What has?

04:53.647 --> 04:55.642
You said you needed a break,

04:55.647 --> 04:57.642
I asked how long, you
said six months. So...

04:57.647 --> 04:59.642
I don't remember that.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.642
But if I said it, I, I didn't mean...

05:01.647 --> 05:03.647
Things are better between us,

05:04.647 --> 05:05.642
are they not?

05:05.647 --> 05:07.642
We, we should celebrate.

05:07.647 --> 05:09.642
I, I got flowers in the
car, they're probably wilted.

05:09.647 --> 05:11.642
- Emma, would you wait in the car?
- Come on.

05:11.647 --> 05:13.647
- Why?
- Please.

05:20.647 --> 05:21.642
What's the problem now?

05:21.647 --> 05:23.642
Whatever I said six months ago,

05:23.647 --> 05:24.642
I didn't mean that we would take a break

05:24.647 --> 05:26.642
and everything would
go back to how it was.

05:26.647 --> 05:28.642
And we can't keep
having this conversation.

05:28.647 --> 05:30.647
We should be a family
again. You know, for Emma.

05:31.647 --> 05:35.642
She is why we can't do
it. And you know that.

05:35.647 --> 05:38.642
Can you just take this? It's a necklace.

05:38.647 --> 05:40.642
It matches your grandmother's ring,

05:40.647 --> 05:42.647
close as I could remember.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.642
No.

05:45.647 --> 05:47.642
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with it?

05:47.647 --> 05:50.647
- I'll see you Saturday.
- All right.

06:16.647 --> 06:18.647
You ever watch Rachael Ray?

06:20.647 --> 06:22.642
- The talk show?
- Yeah.

06:22.647 --> 06:25.642
I, I don't make a point of it.

06:25.647 --> 06:26.642
Well, she's good.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.642
Perceptive.

06:28.647 --> 06:30.642
She had a therapist on
with her this morning,

06:30.647 --> 06:33.642
with a book about how to
maintain healthy relationships.

06:33.647 --> 06:35.642
- Okay.
- And she said,

06:35.647 --> 06:37.642
you gotta work on communication.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.642
You gotta learn how to love yourself.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.647
Love yourself, okay.

06:43.647 --> 06:45.642
And you gotta take responsibility.

06:45.647 --> 06:46.642
And it got me thinking...

06:46.647 --> 06:49.642
- Give me a hand, will ya?
- Yeah.

06:49.647 --> 06:52.642
You know, I've been trying
to change Katie's mind

06:52.647 --> 06:54.642
about our situation, you know.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.642
But, what if I need to
be responsible, you know?

06:57.647 --> 07:01.642
What if it's me that needs to change?

07:01.647 --> 07:03.642
- How?
- Well, that's the problem.

07:03.647 --> 07:06.642
I mean, there's so
much she wants changed,

07:06.647 --> 07:07.767
I don't know where to start.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.647
Two, three.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.642
The thing I don't feel great about,

07:29.647 --> 07:30.642
is lying to my kid, you know.

07:30.647 --> 07:31.642
Sure.

07:31.647 --> 07:33.642
Yeah. Saying I run a warehouse.

07:33.647 --> 07:36.642
Not even an exciting
conceit. What am I gonna say?

07:36.647 --> 07:39.642
All right, look, everybody
lies to their kids. All right?

07:39.647 --> 07:41.642
Fuckin' Santa Claus and...

07:41.647 --> 07:43.642
Katie doesn't like it.

07:43.647 --> 07:46.647
Doesn't like Emma hanging out
with the people I work with.

07:48.647 --> 07:50.642
- Me?
- Yeah.

07:50.647 --> 07:51.642
I mean, if you had kids,

07:51.647 --> 07:53.642
would you want 'em hanging
out with people like you?

07:53.647 --> 07:55.642
How you spend your day...

07:55.647 --> 07:56.642
The same as you.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.647
Fucking exactly.

08:07.647 --> 08:09.647
The people we hang out with

08:10.647 --> 08:13.642
are predators,

08:13.647 --> 08:15.642
knuckleheads.

08:15.647 --> 08:16.647
You mean Yago?

08:17.647 --> 08:19.642
Will you do me a favor, please,

08:19.647 --> 08:22.647
and show a little respect?

08:25.647 --> 08:27.642
He gets an online college degree

08:27.647 --> 08:29.642
and now he runs the daytoday?

08:29.647 --> 08:31.642
And we're supposed to take him serious?

08:31.647 --> 08:35.642
Always trying to prove how hard he is.

08:35.647 --> 08:36.642
He's insecure.

08:36.647 --> 08:39.642
He's a fucking
maggot, that's what he is.

08:39.647 --> 08:43.642
Yeah. But he's
also Amara's nephew,

08:43.647 --> 08:44.647
and you piss him off.

08:48.647 --> 08:50.647
Well, I cut his tongue out.

08:52.647 --> 08:54.642
You know, the guys saw me do it.

08:54.647 --> 08:55.642
I told him, I was like,

08:55.647 --> 08:56.642
"Jason,"

08:56.647 --> 08:59.642
"give me one good reason to let you go,"

08:59.647 --> 09:02.642
"and I'll open the door, you know."

09:02.647 --> 09:03.647
You know what he says?

09:12.647 --> 09:14.647
I was like, "Come
again. I didn't get that."

09:17.647 --> 09:20.642
Right. You, you offended?

09:20.647 --> 09:23.647
Laughing on the inside.

09:29.647 --> 09:31.642
Well,

09:31.647 --> 09:33.647
Amara wants you to
make a collection in LA.

09:35.647 --> 09:38.647
If the guy doesn't
pay, close the account.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.642
We don't really close accounts.

09:42.647 --> 09:44.647
On this one, you do.

09:46.647 --> 09:49.642
She knows people in LA, right?

09:49.647 --> 09:50.642
Maybe she could give
one of them a shout.

09:50.647 --> 09:52.642
Yeah. Why don't you make a list of jobs

09:52.647 --> 09:54.642
that you rather not do.

09:54.647 --> 09:55.642
That someone else should take care of.

09:55.647 --> 10:01.647
Wh... What if we wait
until things cool down?

10:02.647 --> 10:05.642
I mean, Jason was talking to the Feds.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.642
And they know that he handled our cash,

10:06.647 --> 10:09.642
- and now he's gone, so...
- Yeah.

10:09.647 --> 10:11.642
They're probably watching.

10:11.647 --> 10:13.642
Yeah, like someone's gonna
tail you assholes to California.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.642
Don't flatter yourself.

10:15.647 --> 10:17.647
Why do you sweep the place,
if you're not worried?

10:22.647 --> 10:24.642
This came from Amara.

10:24.647 --> 10:25.647
Yeah. We'll handle it.

10:27.647 --> 10:30.642
Come on, I never been to Hollywood.

10:30.647 --> 10:31.642
- It's in Hollywood?
- Yeah.

10:31.647 --> 10:34.642
We'll make a trip out of
it. See some celebrities.

10:34.647 --> 10:37.647
Yeah. Sandra Bullock will
personally give you a hand job.

10:38.647 --> 10:40.642
If I even think we're being tailed,

10:40.647 --> 10:42.647
we come straight home. All right?

10:44.036 --> 10:45.036
Sounds like a plan.

10:56.647 --> 10:58.647
Have fun.

11:10.004 --> 11:11.004
Here,

11:12.647 --> 11:14.647
drink this. It'll help.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.642
You know, it's funny,

11:22.647 --> 11:24.647
I know we only met a few days ago.

11:28.647 --> 11:32.642
But after everything we've been through,

11:32.647 --> 11:35.647
I don't know, it feels like
I've known you my whole life.

11:36.647 --> 11:38.642
- Me too.
- Yeah?

11:40.647 --> 11:41.647
Here.

12:01.647 --> 12:03.647
Where'd you go?

12:05.329 --> 12:06.329
I'm here.

12:06.647 --> 12:08.647
No.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.647
You're a million miles away.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.647
I can't help it.

12:21.647 --> 12:23.647
I hope you know how grateful
I am for everything...

12:27.647 --> 12:28.642
Can we cut?

12:28.647 --> 12:29.642
- Cut.
- Reset.

12:29.647 --> 12:31.642
Sorry, Lydia.

12:31.647 --> 12:33.642
Lydia, I'm sorry. I
hate being, you know,

12:33.647 --> 12:37.642
"that guy," but I'm
just, I'm bumping on this.

12:37.647 --> 12:38.642
Yeah?

12:38.647 --> 12:39.642
Yeah. Look,

12:39.647 --> 12:43.642
I saved her life twice,
but she keeps pulling away.

12:43.647 --> 12:46.642
You know, I don't ask her
why she's doing it, you know.

12:46.647 --> 12:48.642
She doesn't tell me. It's like...

12:48.647 --> 12:50.642
Honestly, I feel like...

12:50.647 --> 12:53.642
I don't know, just peace out.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.642
All right, let's talk about it.

12:55.647 --> 12:58.642
- Cut the rain.
- Cut the rain!

12:58.647 --> 12:59.642
Cut the rain.

12:59.647 --> 13:00.642
Cut the rain!

13:00.647 --> 13:01.642
Why are we stopped?

13:01.647 --> 13:03.642
Tyler.

13:03.647 --> 13:06.642
How long till lunch?

13:06.647 --> 13:07.642
Twenty minutes.

13:07.647 --> 13:09.642
Fuck!

13:09.647 --> 13:11.642
- Fuck, I got a meeting.
- Okay.

13:11.647 --> 13:14.642
Listen to me, you tell Lydia,

13:14.647 --> 13:16.642
I don't care if she does the
next three scenes in one shot.

13:16.647 --> 13:18.642
- We're making the day.
- Yeah, yeah. All right.

13:18.647 --> 13:19.642
Take this. Take this.

13:19.647 --> 13:20.642
Fuck!

13:20.647 --> 13:22.647
We gotta make the day.

13:35.647 --> 13:38.642
Mr. Moreweather. Nathan Hill.

13:38.647 --> 13:39.642
Have we met?

13:39.647 --> 13:43.642
No. No. I, I, I just wanted
to say hi. I know Tyler.

13:43.647 --> 13:44.642
Okay.

13:44.647 --> 13:46.642
I, I looked up some of your other films.

13:46.647 --> 13:48.642
Out for Blood and Day of Reckoning.

13:48.647 --> 13:50.642
I... They just have really,
really great energy. You know?

13:50.647 --> 13:52.642
Yeah.

13:52.647 --> 13:54.642
See, I'm, I'm an actor.

13:54.647 --> 13:55.642
Really?

13:55.647 --> 13:57.642
Yeah. I study at Stella Adler so...

13:57.647 --> 13:58.642
Well, I, I gotta go so...

13:58.647 --> 14:00.642
Yeah. I jus... I just wanted to say hi.

14:00.647 --> 14:01.642
Yeah. All right. Take care.

14:01.647 --> 14:03.642
Okay.

14:03.647 --> 14:04.647
What...

14:05.647 --> 14:07.642
I think your battery's dead.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.642
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- I can go get help if you want.

14:09.647 --> 14:11.642
I don't have time. Fuck.

14:11.647 --> 14:13.642
Come on.

14:13.647 --> 14:14.642
Really great meeting you.

14:14.647 --> 14:15.642
All right. Thanks.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.642
Should have worn those fucking sneakers.

14:17.647 --> 14:19.647
I was gonna wear them. Fucking sneakers.

14:22.647 --> 14:24.642
It's Nathan.

14:24.647 --> 14:25.647
Come in.

14:28.647 --> 14:29.642
Hey, man.

14:29.647 --> 14:30.647
Hey. What's up?

14:31.647 --> 14:32.642
So,

14:32.647 --> 14:34.642
I just had a good talk
with Rick Moreweather.

14:34.647 --> 14:36.642
I told him I dig his movies...

14:36.647 --> 14:37.647
This script is a joke.

14:38.647 --> 14:39.642
Yeah?

14:39.647 --> 14:43.642
I mean, it's genre, I get it. But...

14:43.647 --> 14:44.642
you gotta give the audience

14:44.647 --> 14:47.642
something to believe in, right?

14:47.647 --> 14:50.642
I'm sorry, it's just
this doesn't feel real.

14:50.647 --> 14:51.642
- I haven't read the...
- You know what it is?

14:51.647 --> 14:54.642
They don't want me and Phoebe hooking up

14:54.647 --> 14:55.642
till the big scene at the end.

14:55.647 --> 14:58.642
So for the whole movie,
she kind of pushes me away.

14:58.647 --> 14:59.642
Like she's not even into me.

14:59.647 --> 15:04.642
I guess, I can play unattractive,

15:04.647 --> 15:05.642
if that's what they want.

15:05.647 --> 15:09.642
Or I can do sex appeal.
But it's like... I mean...

15:09.647 --> 15:10.642
You can't have it both ways.

15:10.647 --> 15:12.647
Yeah, you can't.

15:17.647 --> 15:18.642
Tell me if I'm being a Prima Donna.

15:18.647 --> 15:21.642
No. No, you... Look,
you're just trying to...

15:21.647 --> 15:22.642
Trying to play a human being.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.642
Just trying to play a human being.

15:24.647 --> 15:25.642
Sorry.

15:25.647 --> 15:27.647
Yeah. I can relate.

15:28.647 --> 15:31.642
To... What are you... To the story?

15:31.647 --> 15:33.642
As an actor.

15:33.647 --> 15:36.642
You know, I'm, I'm doing
this scene in class, you know.

15:36.647 --> 15:37.642
- I play this excop...
- Right.

15:37.647 --> 15:39.642
Who gets fired
because he's an alcoholic.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.642
- My scene partner he's...
- Right.

15:40.647 --> 15:42.642
Same as last week?

15:43.647 --> 15:44.642
Sorry, I just caught a peek at the time.

15:44.647 --> 15:46.642
- They're gonna want me on set.
- Okay.

15:46.647 --> 15:48.642
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

15:48.647 --> 15:51.642
- Thanks, bro.
- No worries.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.642
Hey, Billy.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.647
Who is that?

16:43.647 --> 16:45.647
It's all right. All right.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.646
Gladys? Have I got a shirt?

17:20.646 --> 17:21.642
Not to my knowledge.

17:21.646 --> 17:23.646
Wh...

17:25.646 --> 17:28.642
And April Quinn is here.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.642
Okay. Just, tell her to wait.

17:30.647 --> 17:32.647
By "here" I mean, here.

17:33.647 --> 17:35.642
Hello, hello, hello!

17:35.647 --> 17:37.642
April. Come on. Come in. Come in. Hey.

17:37.647 --> 17:38.642
Hi.

17:38.647 --> 17:39.642
I would have came to you.

17:39.647 --> 17:41.642
Yeah. No, this is perfect,

17:41.647 --> 17:42.642
I have a meeting around
the corner in 10 minutes.

17:42.647 --> 17:45.642
Okay. Thank you, Gladys.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.642
Sorry, I keep rescheduling lunch,

17:47.647 --> 17:50.642
it's just, working with
Vin Diesel. You can imagine.

17:50.647 --> 17:52.642
I can.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.642
What's the budget on that project?

17:54.647 --> 17:55.642
180 million.

17:55.647 --> 17:57.642
I know, it's ridiculous.

17:57.647 --> 17:59.642
Four hundred grand for fake snow.

17:59.647 --> 18:00.642
How are you?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.642
I'm doing fairly good. I'm, I'm, I'm...

18:02.647 --> 18:05.642
Of course I still have no
personal life, I mean zero.

18:05.647 --> 18:06.642
Mom got me tropical fish,

18:06.647 --> 18:08.642
I didn't have time to feed them.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.642
Every morning there was another
one just floating on top.

18:10.647 --> 18:13.647
I'm rambling, had a double latte.

18:14.647 --> 18:15.642
Come to think of it,

18:15.647 --> 18:17.642
I never had a personal life
working for you, either.

18:17.647 --> 18:19.642
Right.

18:19.647 --> 18:20.642
Six years ago!

18:20.647 --> 18:22.647
Isn't that insane?

18:24.647 --> 18:27.642
Sit, sit. I'm shooting a movie.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.642
Okay.

18:29.647 --> 18:31.642
Yeah. Tyler Mathis, he's the lead,

18:31.647 --> 18:33.642
and, and we're behind schedule.

18:33.647 --> 18:35.642
The problem is he leaves in two weeks

18:35.647 --> 18:38.642
to shoot a very small part in your film,

18:38.647 --> 18:41.642
Lethal Limit... What, Three?

18:41.647 --> 18:42.642
- Four.
- Four.

18:42.647 --> 18:44.642
Which means I'm screwed.

18:44.647 --> 18:49.642
Unless, you can schedule
his shooting days later.

18:49.647 --> 18:51.642
You understand.

18:51.647 --> 18:52.642
Of course.

18:52.647 --> 18:54.642
Thank you.

18:54.647 --> 18:56.642
No, no. I mean I understand,

18:56.647 --> 18:59.642
but that's not my call.
That's Brandon's call.

19:04.647 --> 19:06.642
Will you talk to Brandon?

19:06.647 --> 19:07.642
All the time.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.642
About this.

19:09.647 --> 19:11.642
I mean, I'll do my best. But, sorry,

19:11.647 --> 19:13.642
- I gotta go.
- Okay. Yeah.

19:13.647 --> 19:15.642
So, it was, it was
really good to see you.

19:15.647 --> 19:16.642
You too.

19:16.647 --> 19:18.647
We'll do lunch next week, okay?

19:19.647 --> 19:20.647
Or, soon!

19:26.647 --> 19:28.647
This guy's been on us a while.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.647
Is he tailing us?

19:33.647 --> 19:36.642
No. We're good.

19:36.647 --> 19:37.642
But I'm jumpy.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.647
I'm fucking jumpy now. I hate that.

19:43.647 --> 19:45.642
It's a condo I'm looking at.

19:45.647 --> 19:47.642
Yeah? How'd you find it?

19:47.647 --> 19:51.647
One of the elders at church
is the building manager.

19:52.647 --> 19:53.642
Lot of Mormons there.

19:53.647 --> 19:57.642
Well, you'll be right at home.

19:57.647 --> 19:59.642
One, big, Mormon block party.

19:59.647 --> 20:01.642
You gotta be kidding me.

20:01.647 --> 20:05.642
This is the Hollywood Walk of Fame?

20:05.647 --> 20:07.642
- That's what it says.
- This?

20:07.647 --> 20:08.642
It's a walk, it's not
a fucking cathedral.

20:08.647 --> 20:12.642
I know. But compared to
Vegas, this is embarrassing.

20:12.647 --> 20:13.642
I thought they made big movies here.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.642
Yeah. Studios are all in Burbank.

20:16.647 --> 20:19.642
Well, how do you know?

20:19.647 --> 20:21.642
At the end of a movie, it
says where they filmed it.

20:21.647 --> 20:23.642
I hope Burbank is better than this.

20:23.647 --> 20:24.647
'Cause this is bullshit.

20:41.647 --> 20:43.642
One second.

20:43.647 --> 20:46.642
- Owen?
- Hello?

20:46.647 --> 20:47.642
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.642
Yeah. Owen, Owen's
not here right now.

20:49.647 --> 20:51.642
Okay.

20:51.647 --> 20:53.642
Well, we're friends of
Owen's from back in the day.

20:53.647 --> 20:56.642
- Nice.
- Yeah, I'm Barry and this is Vernon.

20:56.647 --> 20:57.642
That's right. Yeah.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.642
We thought we'd, swing and say hi

20:59.647 --> 21:00.642
seeing that we were in town.

21:00.647 --> 21:02.642
Cool. I... Yeah, I...

21:02.647 --> 21:04.642
He's probably with his
girlfriend. I'm not sure.

21:04.647 --> 21:05.642
Well, we don't want to impose.

21:05.647 --> 21:07.642
Do you think you could text him?

21:07.647 --> 21:08.642
Yeah, maybe just find out where he is.

21:08.647 --> 21:09.642
But don't tell him that we're here.

21:09.647 --> 21:10.642
That's right. We'd love
to keep it a secret.

21:10.647 --> 21:11.642
Yeah.

21:11.647 --> 21:14.642
Okay, cool. Wh...

21:14.647 --> 21:15.642
What do you want me to say, exactly?

21:15.647 --> 21:17.642
God. I don't know.

21:17.647 --> 21:19.642
Maybe tell him that you got
a spare ticket for...

21:19.647 --> 21:20.642
- Dodgers game.
- And maybe if he was free.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.642
Yeah.

21:22.647 --> 21:25.642
We don't really hang out a lot.

21:25.647 --> 21:28.647
So, I mean he might not
get back to me right away.

21:31.647 --> 21:32.642
We'll wait.

21:32.647 --> 21:34.647
Okay.

21:37.647 --> 21:38.642
- Do you want to wait inside?
- That'd be sweet.

21:38.647 --> 21:41.642
- Yeah. That'd be great.
- Cool. Yeah.

21:41.647 --> 21:44.642
Um, yeah, so I'll text him.

21:44.647 --> 21:47.642
Um, we'll see what he says.

21:47.647 --> 21:49.642
I'm Nathan, by the way.

21:49.647 --> 21:50.642
Hey.

21:50.647 --> 21:52.642
Nathan, you a model or something?

21:52.647 --> 21:55.642
No. An, an actor. Headshots.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.642
- No kidding.
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:57.647 --> 22:00.642
Five minutes in Hollywood,
and already we know an actor.

22:00.647 --> 22:02.642
So, you're, you're
friends with Owen, right?

22:02.647 --> 22:04.642
You from Houston or...

22:04.647 --> 22:06.642
Something smells good.

22:06.647 --> 22:08.642
- Is that chili or something?
- No. It's, it's stirfry.

22:08.647 --> 22:10.642
Can I check it out?

22:10.647 --> 22:11.642
- Yeah.
- That is... Yeah.

22:11.647 --> 22:13.642
Yeah. Barry's a real foodie.

22:13.647 --> 22:16.642
Really?

22:16.647 --> 22:17.647
You could sit...

22:19.647 --> 22:21.642
Yeah. What are the, white things?

22:21.647 --> 22:23.642
Um, water chestnuts. That's sharp.

22:25.647 --> 22:27.642
See, I would never think to do that.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.642
I would never think
to cook with chestnuts.

22:29.647 --> 22:31.642
You want some?

22:31.647 --> 22:33.642
- You sure?
- Yeah.

22:33.647 --> 22:37.647
Thanks, man. You're a prince.

22:44.647 --> 22:46.647
Looks fun.

22:49.647 --> 22:50.642
Zsolt and I hear you're the focus

22:50.647 --> 22:52.647
of a Federal investigation.

22:53.647 --> 22:54.642
Is that true?

22:54.647 --> 22:56.647
I like this ride. You wanna take me?

22:58.647 --> 23:01.642
Mrs. De Escalones is
not under investigation.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.642
Then why not launder?

23:03.647 --> 23:07.642
Invest your money through your own
casino? Wouldn't that be easier?

23:07.647 --> 23:09.642
My casino is small. But
I have a lot of money.

23:09.647 --> 23:13.642
My banker, he don't work for me anymore.

23:13.647 --> 23:16.642
I have three parks,
attendance is phenomenal.

23:16.647 --> 23:18.642
Concessions, merchandise,

23:18.647 --> 23:21.642
half the ticketing is cashbased.

23:21.647 --> 23:23.642
We can handle any amount you bring us.

23:23.647 --> 23:26.642
But, we have to be compensated.

23:26.647 --> 23:27.642
- 12%.
- Eight.

23:27.647 --> 23:29.647
- Our bottom line.
- I talk to him.

23:33.647 --> 23:35.642
You know this business.

23:35.647 --> 23:36.647
My business, I know.

23:38.647 --> 23:40.642
You and me have a drink tonight.

23:40.647 --> 23:42.642
We decide how to work together.

23:42.647 --> 23:43.647
Okay?

23:50.647 --> 23:52.642
It's gotta be fun to be an actor.

23:52.647 --> 23:55.642
You do movies? Or just TV?

23:55.647 --> 23:57.642
I... No... I'm taking classes.

23:57.647 --> 23:59.642
You know, studying.

23:59.647 --> 24:02.642
But I was on a movie set at,
Gravity Studios today.

24:02.647 --> 24:03.642
No shit.

24:03.647 --> 24:06.642
Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm
friends with this actor.

24:06.647 --> 24:07.642
His name's Tyler Mathis.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.642
You know him?

24:08.647 --> 24:10.642
No.

24:10.647 --> 24:11.642
He's good. Um,

24:11.647 --> 24:13.642
then I hung out with Rick Moreweather,

24:13.647 --> 24:14.642
he's the producer.

24:14.647 --> 24:16.642
They... They're making a film
that's called The Hunting.

24:16.647 --> 24:17.642
That's a good title.

24:17.647 --> 24:20.642
Yeah. The, the script
has a few problems.

24:20.647 --> 24:21.642
Is that right?

24:21.647 --> 24:24.642
Yeah. It's about a guy
and a girl in a motel.

24:24.647 --> 24:26.642
They don't get together
till the very end.

24:26.647 --> 24:29.642
I, like, she, she pushes
him away for no reason.

24:29.647 --> 24:31.642
I hate when movies do that.

24:31.647 --> 24:33.642
Right? Yeah.

24:33.647 --> 24:35.642
The guy in the story, what's his job?

24:35.647 --> 24:37.647
Kills aliens.

24:38.647 --> 24:39.647
Okay.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.642
So his life is dangerous.

24:43.647 --> 24:44.647
Yeah.

24:46.647 --> 24:50.642
Maybe the woman wants to be
with him, but she can't be.

24:50.647 --> 24:52.642
Because?

24:52.647 --> 24:53.642
She has a 12yearold daughter.

24:53.647 --> 24:55.647
Has to put the kid first.

24:56.647 --> 24:59.642
That's good.

24:59.647 --> 25:01.642
A little complicated, but...

25:01.647 --> 25:05.642
Life is fucking complicated shitballs.

25:05.647 --> 25:07.642
He's at his girlfriend's.

25:07.647 --> 25:08.642
Where's she live?

25:08.647 --> 25:09.642
I don't know.

25:09.647 --> 25:12.642
But, that's her,
right there with him.

25:12.647 --> 25:14.642
There's Owen and his girlfriend.

25:16.647 --> 25:17.927
Well, I guess we gotta be going.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.642
Yeah!

25:20.647 --> 25:21.642
- So fun.
- Yeah.

25:21.647 --> 25:22.642
- So fun.
- Yeah.

25:22.647 --> 25:25.642
- Well, listen...
- Look, great. Okay.

25:25.647 --> 25:27.642
Yeah. Hey.!

25:27.647 --> 25:29.090
Look, we're gonna be in town for a bit.

25:29.096 --> 25:29.642
Yeah.

25:29.647 --> 25:31.642
But we still want to surprise him...

25:31.647 --> 25:33.642
so mum's the word.

25:33.647 --> 25:34.642
- Got ya.
- Yeah?

25:34.647 --> 25:36.642
Got ya. Cool.

25:36.647 --> 25:37.642
That's all right.

25:37.647 --> 25:38.642
Best of luck with the
whole acting thing.

25:38.647 --> 25:42.642
Yeah. Thank you. Lovely meeting you.

25:42.647 --> 25:44.647
Have a good one. Bye.

26:13.647 --> 26:16.642
Jesus, get some air in here, will you?

26:16.647 --> 26:18.647
Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.385
Our guy come home?

26:27.647 --> 26:29.647
Might have while we were sleeping.

26:31.647 --> 26:33.642
Why didn't we get a hotel?

26:33.647 --> 26:35.642
My fucking neck.

26:35.647 --> 26:36.807
You find this job meaningful?

26:38.647 --> 26:39.647
What?

26:40.647 --> 26:42.647
Fulfilling spiritually?

26:43.647 --> 26:45.642
It's a job, man.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.642
In a tough economy.

26:47.647 --> 26:48.642
When I started off,

26:48.647 --> 26:51.642
I convinced myself
that this was temporary.

26:51.647 --> 26:52.642
Katie was 19,

26:52.647 --> 26:54.642
back when she thought it was sexy

26:54.647 --> 26:55.642
to be with a tough guy.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.642
But it's not fucking sexy.

26:57.647 --> 26:58.642
Limping back to your apartment

26:58.647 --> 27:01.642
and scraping blood
from under your nails.

27:01.647 --> 27:04.642
Opening a beer, and watching
fucking Storage Wars.

27:06.647 --> 27:08.642
She was okay with it.

27:08.647 --> 27:10.647
Until Indian Springs...

27:15.647 --> 27:17.642
That freaked her out.

27:17.647 --> 27:20.647
But if I changed my job,

27:21.647 --> 27:22.642
she might take me back.

27:22.647 --> 27:27.642
Yeah. Just tell Amara you want to quit,

27:27.647 --> 27:29.642
see how that goes.

27:37.647 --> 27:40.647
Maybe I skip town with the family.

27:42.647 --> 27:44.642
You know, I have a
cousin who sells carpets,

27:44.647 --> 27:45.642
and he's convinced that

27:45.647 --> 27:47.642
if you have even a basic
understanding of fiber density,

27:47.647 --> 27:49.642
like polyester versus nylon and whatnot,

27:49.647 --> 27:51.642
you can move anywhere and make a living.

27:51.647 --> 27:54.647
Even if Amara didn't find you?

27:56.647 --> 27:58.642
Six months of fiber density,

27:58.647 --> 28:00.647
and you'd jump off a fucking roof.

28:13.647 --> 28:14.647
Yeah.

28:22.647 --> 28:24.642
Everything cool, dude?

28:24.647 --> 28:27.642
Sorry.

28:27.647 --> 28:28.642
That's cool.

28:28.647 --> 28:33.642
- You want to...
- Commence?

28:33.647 --> 28:35.642
In the movie you're doing right now,

28:35.647 --> 28:40.642
what if the girl wants to be with you,

28:40.647 --> 28:42.642
only she can't.

28:42.647 --> 28:43.642
And the reason is...

28:43.647 --> 28:45.642
She's got a daughter.

28:45.647 --> 28:46.642
What?

28:46.647 --> 28:49.642
She's got a 12yearold daughter.

28:49.647 --> 28:52.642
That way, even though
she's aching to be with him,

28:52.647 --> 28:55.642
I mean, obviously, you know,
she's gotta put the kid first.

28:55.647 --> 28:56.642
It does make sense.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.642
Wh... Other than rewriting and
reshooting the entire movie.

28:58.647 --> 29:00.642
- I mean, but it's doable.
- Ooh.

29:00.647 --> 29:02.642
We lose him in two weeks!

29:02.647 --> 29:03.642
Yeah. But only for a month.

29:03.647 --> 29:05.642
Okay. Okay.

29:05.647 --> 29:06.642
So we just wait till you're available,

29:06.647 --> 29:09.642
and then reassemble the
sets, the crew and locations.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.642
If that's what we gotta do. Yeah.

29:13.647 --> 29:14.642
In order for you to,

29:14.647 --> 29:16.642
to track your character's motivation

29:16.647 --> 29:18.642
while you run from aliens.

29:18.647 --> 29:21.642
Rick, Rick, Rick, um,

29:21.647 --> 29:22.642
I have script approval.

29:22.647 --> 29:23.642
All right. We don't
need to go there, right?

29:23.647 --> 29:25.642
I mean, we'll work something out.

29:25.647 --> 29:26.642
Look, man, it's in my contract.

29:26.647 --> 29:29.642
So you guys just let me know

29:29.647 --> 29:32.647
when there's something to approve. Okay?

29:33.647 --> 29:34.642
Shit.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.642
I just thought the idea...

29:35.647 --> 29:36.647
Shut up, Lydia.

29:48.647 --> 29:49.642
Hey.

29:49.647 --> 29:50.642
What the hell is that?

29:50.647 --> 29:52.647
Vocal warmups.

29:54.647 --> 29:56.642
I got home and I saw your note.

29:56.647 --> 29:58.642
I can't read your writing.

29:58.647 --> 30:01.642
Does this say Barry and Vernon?

30:01.647 --> 30:03.642
Yeah. They didn't
want me to tell you,

30:03.647 --> 30:07.642
but I was afraid they'd leave
town and you'd miss them.

30:07.647 --> 30:10.642
I don't have friends
named Barry and Vernon.

30:10.647 --> 30:12.642
Really?

30:12.647 --> 30:14.642
Maybe they found the suitcase.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.642
What did they look like?

30:16.647 --> 30:19.642
Big guys, one of 'em is Irish,

30:19.647 --> 30:21.647
you know, but really nice.

30:25.647 --> 30:26.647
Owen?

30:27.647 --> 30:28.647
Owen?

30:30.647 --> 30:32.642
Hope you're not
pissed, they wanted to...

30:32.647 --> 30:33.642
They wanted to surprise you.

30:33.647 --> 30:34.647
I gotta go.

31:34.647 --> 31:35.927
Would you like a hand with that?

31:49.647 --> 31:51.647
Argh!

31:59.647 --> 32:02.647
Do me a favor and just
scoot over that way.

32:03.647 --> 32:05.642
Why?

32:05.647 --> 32:06.642
Well, cleaning your
brains off that bookcase

32:06.647 --> 32:07.642
is gonna be a hassle,

32:07.647 --> 32:09.642
whereas there, all I need

32:09.647 --> 32:10.642
are paper towels and garbage bags.

32:10.647 --> 32:12.647
You got paper towels?

32:14.647 --> 32:15.642
That's a real question.

32:15.647 --> 32:17.642
Now.

32:17.647 --> 32:20.642
Alternatively, you pay
what you fucking owe,

32:20.647 --> 32:24.642
and no one has to clean up
your, you know, bits.

32:24.647 --> 32:27.642
I just... I don't have it right now.

32:27.647 --> 32:30.642
There must be some money
you can get from somewhere.

32:30.647 --> 32:31.642
Twenty grand even?

32:31.647 --> 32:32.642
He owes 50.

32:32.647 --> 32:33.642
I realize that, Barry.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.642
I'm not saying he's off the hook.

32:35.647 --> 32:36.642
My car.

32:36.647 --> 32:37.642
Which is?

32:37.647 --> 32:38.647
Honda Civic.

32:39.647 --> 32:41.642
2004.

32:41.647 --> 32:44.642
Well, that's 500 bucks.
You only got 49,500 to go.

32:44.647 --> 32:45.642
What were you thinking,

32:45.647 --> 32:47.642
taking a marker for 50 grand?

32:47.647 --> 32:51.642
I'm such an idiot!

32:51.647 --> 32:53.647
Trying to finance
a movie playing blackjack.

32:55.647 --> 32:56.642
What's that? A movie?

32:56.647 --> 32:58.642
Ten years writing,

32:58.647 --> 33:00.642
I couldn't catch a break.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.647
Then I write that!

33:04.647 --> 33:07.642
It puts everything else
I've ever written to shame.

33:07.647 --> 33:12.642
And my stupid agent dumps me,

33:12.647 --> 33:14.642
I can't sell it.

33:14.647 --> 33:17.642
But if I can produce
it, I'm telling you,

33:17.647 --> 33:18.642
it's gonna win a fucking Oscar.

33:18.647 --> 33:20.647
And we give a shit.

33:21.647 --> 33:22.647
What's it about?

33:24.647 --> 33:27.642
It's about Georgian England.

33:28.647 --> 33:29.647
A love story.

33:30.647 --> 33:32.642
It rips your heart out.

33:34.647 --> 33:35.647
Hey!

33:36.647 --> 33:37.642
Hey!

33:37.647 --> 33:39.647
You want something of value?

33:40.647 --> 33:42.642
I'll make you both producers.

33:42.647 --> 33:45.642
Movie sells, you make...

33:45.647 --> 33:48.642
Ten times what I owe.

33:48.647 --> 33:49.642
Just cut it out, man.

33:49.647 --> 33:50.642
You either you got
the money or you don't.

33:50.647 --> 33:52.642
Just hold upon it... What?

33:52.647 --> 33:53.642
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:53.647 --> 33:55.642
What does that mean, producers?

33:55.647 --> 33:58.642
Your name's in the credits.

33:58.647 --> 34:01.642
You'd be at all the awards shows.

34:01.647 --> 34:04.642
You get points on the back end.

34:07.647 --> 34:08.641
The fuck?

34:08.647 --> 34:10.641
What?

34:10.647 --> 34:12.704
We're having a conversation, man.

34:13.647 --> 34:14.641
I thought you were finished.

34:14.647 --> 34:16.647
He was fucking midsentence!

34:18.647 --> 34:20.641
Well, how great of a
writer can he really be,

34:20.647 --> 34:21.641
living in this shithole?

34:21.647 --> 34:23.647
He said he had paper towels.

34:32.647 --> 34:35.647
He's got trash bags. Here we go.

34:47.647 --> 34:48.647
Fuck.

35:01.647 --> 35:03.642
You've been working for Amara too long.

35:03.647 --> 35:05.642
Hit a lull in the
conversation and you think,

35:05.647 --> 35:07.647
"Well? Might as well shoot him."

35:09.647 --> 35:10.647
Jesus.

35:13.647 --> 35:15.642
Text from Yago.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.642
Wants us to check in at the casino.

35:17.647 --> 35:20.642
Drive an extra 40 minutes?

35:20.647 --> 35:21.642
Can we not just call him?

35:21.647 --> 35:23.647
Telling you what it says.

35:26.647 --> 35:28.642
Owen's roommate, Nathan.

35:28.647 --> 35:30.642
He said he knew a
producer over at Universal.

35:30.647 --> 35:32.642
A guy called "Rick" something.

35:32.647 --> 35:34.642
Why didn't he just
give the script to him?

35:37.647 --> 35:38.642
To who?

35:38.647 --> 35:41.647
I guess Owen and Nathan
weren't too tight.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.642
Is it any good?

35:50.647 --> 35:52.642
I don't know.

35:52.647 --> 35:55.642
I get carsick if I
read while I'm driving.

35:55.647 --> 35:57.647
Also the pages are stuck together.

36:04.647 --> 36:06.642
How hard can it be?

36:06.647 --> 36:08.647
What?

36:09.647 --> 36:10.642
Producing a movie.

36:10.647 --> 36:13.642
Jesus, you still
talking about this?

36:13.647 --> 36:14.642
We've got a script.

36:14.647 --> 36:15.642
You haven't read it.

36:15.647 --> 36:17.642
Owen said it was good.

36:18.647 --> 36:22.642
You need money and actors

36:22.647 --> 36:24.647
and, you know,

36:25.647 --> 36:26.642
lights.

36:26.647 --> 36:27.642
I mean, you can't just go to Home Depot

36:27.647 --> 36:29.642
and pull that shit off the shelf.

36:29.647 --> 36:31.642
We don't know the first fucking thing.

36:33.647 --> 36:34.642
So we find someone who does.

36:34.647 --> 36:38.642
Okay, you talked
to a writer for three minutes,

36:38.647 --> 36:41.642
and then suddenly
you're Marvin Scorcese.

36:41.647 --> 36:43.642
Martin.

36:43.647 --> 36:45.642
Martin Scorcese.

36:45.647 --> 36:46.642
Whatever.

36:46.647 --> 36:48.642
Well, forgive me for thinking
I can do something meaningful.

36:48.647 --> 36:49.642
Something that lasts.

36:49.647 --> 36:51.642
What are you rambling about?

36:51.647 --> 36:53.642
The old movies I used to watch as a kid?

36:53.647 --> 36:56.642
I watch the same movies now with Emma.

36:56.647 --> 37:00.647
Whereas all you and me do, is bury shit.

37:01.647 --> 37:03.642
Now maybe in a movie,

37:03.647 --> 37:05.642
digging a hole would be exciting.

37:05.647 --> 37:10.642
There'd be a soundtrack and actors

37:10.647 --> 37:11.642
and a plot.

37:11.647 --> 37:13.642
It would lead somewhere.

37:13.647 --> 37:16.642
But in real life, digging
a hole is pointless

37:16.647 --> 37:20.647
and unpleasant and boring
and a pain in the ass.

37:21.647 --> 37:25.642
You okay? Not usually this quiet.

37:25.647 --> 37:27.642
What kind of an
idiot drives a car like that?

37:27.647 --> 37:30.647
Think maybe he's
compensating for something?

37:31.647 --> 37:33.642
Goodness.

37:33.647 --> 37:35.642
Makes us drive out here to check in

37:35.647 --> 37:36.642
and he wasn't gonna fucking wait for us.

37:36.647 --> 37:38.642
Easy.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.642
If I'm around definitely
invite me to that shit.

37:40.647 --> 37:41.642
You told us to check in.

37:41.647 --> 37:43.647
And you did.

37:44.647 --> 37:45.642
Where are you going?

37:45.647 --> 37:46.642
Where am I going?

37:46.647 --> 37:49.642
To your mother's for a
rim job and a slice of pie.

37:49.647 --> 37:51.647
Thanks for asking.

37:55.647 --> 37:57.642
What a cunt!

37:57.647 --> 37:59.642
See that?

37:59.647 --> 38:01.647
What was that?

38:04.647 --> 38:06.647
You wanna tell me something?

38:08.647 --> 38:09.642
Not a big deal.

38:09.647 --> 38:10.642
No, what's not a big deal?

38:10.647 --> 38:12.642
The scratch you put on his truck.

38:12.647 --> 38:15.642
Guys, I don't even care. It was
already scratched. Doesn't matter.

38:15.647 --> 38:16.642
Shit.

38:16.647 --> 38:18.642
That little mark? Did I do that?

38:18.647 --> 38:20.642
Yeah, you hit it with your clown car.

38:20.647 --> 38:22.642
So maybe I should give you

38:22.647 --> 38:25.642
the papers to my insurance company.

38:25.647 --> 38:28.642
Or maybe I should get on
my knees and buff it out.

38:28.647 --> 38:29.647
Is that what you want?

38:30.647 --> 38:31.642
Up to you.

38:31.647 --> 38:33.642
Okay. Okay.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.642
Come on, man...

38:36.647 --> 38:38.647
Who the fuck you think you are?

38:39.647 --> 38:40.647
Don't point that at me.

38:41.647 --> 38:43.647
You don't tell me what to do...

38:44.647 --> 38:46.642
Yo! Yo!

38:46.647 --> 38:50.642
Shit! Motherfucker!

38:50.647 --> 38:53.642
You're a dead man. You're a dead man.

38:53.647 --> 38:54.647
Yo! Hold him.

38:56.647 --> 38:58.647
For when he calms down, yeah?

38:59.647 --> 39:01.642
Get off!

39:01.647 --> 39:02.982
Give me your piece, Ed. Give me your

39:02.988 --> 39:04.642
piece, Ed. Give me your fucking piece.

39:04.647 --> 39:06.642
- What did I say?
- We should probably go.

39:06.647 --> 39:07.642
Yeah. What did I say?

39:07.647 --> 39:08.642
What did I say?

39:08.647 --> 39:11.642
Treat him with respect,
just show him respect,

39:11.647 --> 39:12.642
you don't have to respect him.

39:12.647 --> 39:15.642
Just show him respect.

39:15.647 --> 39:18.642
God! Is that so hard? Motherfucker, God!

39:18.647 --> 39:20.642
- Hey!
- I'm the one out of line?

39:20.647 --> 39:22.642
Yeah! You're out of line.

39:22.647 --> 39:23.642
Hey!

39:23.647 --> 39:24.642
I'll smooth things over tomorrow.

39:24.647 --> 39:25.642
Yeah, sure.

39:25.647 --> 39:27.647
Puta.

40:25.647 --> 40:27.642
You were this whole
other person up there.

40:27.647 --> 40:30.642
- I forgot who I was watching.
- Come on.

40:30.647 --> 40:32.642
I did. I'm serious.
That's a real talent.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.642
- Hi. You were so great!
- Hey.

40:34.647 --> 40:36.642
Thank you.

40:36.647 --> 40:38.642
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

40:39.647 --> 40:40.642
Fantastic.

40:40.647 --> 40:41.647
Thank you.

40:42.647 --> 40:44.642
Hi. I'm Jeffrey.

40:44.647 --> 40:45.647
Miles.

40:47.647 --> 40:48.642
Did you have a kid in the play?

40:48.647 --> 40:51.642
- No.
- He came with me.

40:51.647 --> 40:52.642
Can I talk to you, please?

40:52.647 --> 40:54.642
Just a second, sweetheart.

40:54.647 --> 40:55.642
My gosh.

40:55.647 --> 40:57.642
Um...

40:57.647 --> 40:58.642
You brought a date.

40:58.647 --> 40:59.642
I thought you were out of town.

40:59.647 --> 41:00.642
You banging this guy?

41:00.647 --> 41:01.642
None of your business!

41:01.647 --> 41:03.647
The fuck it's not.

41:05.647 --> 41:08.642
I, I know him through friends at work

41:08.647 --> 41:11.642
and I, I... I've started seeing him.

41:11.647 --> 41:13.642
I should have told you.
It's just, it's still new.

41:13.647 --> 41:15.642
You brought him to her play.

41:15.647 --> 41:16.642
He wanted to come.

41:16.647 --> 41:19.647
And far as Emma knows, he's a friend.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.642
Miles, nothing happens to him.

41:27.647 --> 41:29.642
Okay. Nothing.

41:29.647 --> 41:32.642
He gets hit by lightning,
I will know it's you.

41:32.647 --> 41:33.642
Listen,

41:33.647 --> 41:35.642
I'm making changes in my life.

41:35.647 --> 41:37.642
Career changes.

41:37.647 --> 41:39.642
Exciting ones. I mean, it's...

41:39.647 --> 41:43.642
It's all a bit hushhush
right now, but, Katie...

41:46.908 --> 41:47.908
Okay.

41:48.647 --> 41:51.647
Well, I think that's great.

41:52.647 --> 41:54.642
For your sake.

41:54.647 --> 41:56.647
We left Emma standing there.

41:59.647 --> 42:00.642
Hey.

42:00.647 --> 42:02.642
Do you want to go get something to eat?

42:02.647 --> 42:03.647
Yeah. Let's do that.

42:48.647 --> 42:50.642
You wanna eat something?

42:50.647 --> 42:51.647
The shrimp you like?

42:52.647 --> 42:53.647
I am fine.

42:55.647 --> 42:59.642
So, let's agree on a number.

42:59.647 --> 43:01.642
We're asking for 12.

43:01.647 --> 43:02.642
You were going to sleep on it.

43:02.647 --> 43:04.647
No sleep for me.

43:06.647 --> 43:07.642
We did our homework.

43:07.647 --> 43:10.642
Attendance at your parks is excellent.

43:10.647 --> 43:12.642
Problem is the water quota.

43:12.647 --> 43:13.642
Since the drought,

43:13.647 --> 43:16.642
you get fined by the county every month.

43:16.647 --> 43:18.642
They're raising the price per gallon,

43:18.647 --> 43:19.647
and you're losing money.

43:20.647 --> 43:21.647
Which means you need us.

43:23.647 --> 43:25.647
Hold on.

43:31.647 --> 43:32.642
9% or we walk.

43:32.647 --> 43:34.642
Can't go above five.

43:34.647 --> 43:35.642
Five?

43:35.647 --> 43:36.642
No, no, no. You promised.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.642
Sweetheart.

43:38.647 --> 43:40.647
He does numbers.

43:42.647 --> 43:44.642
I have built this company over 20 years.

43:44.647 --> 43:47.647
I am not about to risk
it over this bullshit.

43:49.146 --> 43:50.146
And you...

43:53.647 --> 43:55.642
You can go fuck yourself.

43:55.647 --> 43:58.647
Because from now on,
I sure as hell won't.

44:17.647 --> 44:19.642
We could go higher.

44:19.647 --> 44:21.642
He don't want to do business with me.

44:21.647 --> 44:23.647
That's okay.

44:45.647 --> 44:47.647
How could she be so blind?

44:58.647 --> 44:59.647
Driver's license.

45:07.647 --> 45:09.642
My assistant forgot to put
the appointment in my phone

45:09.647 --> 45:10.642
and now I can't reach her.

45:10.647 --> 45:13.642
She just got back from her honeymoon.

45:13.647 --> 45:16.647
I think her head's
still between the sheets.

45:19.647 --> 45:22.642
Anyway, I'm meeting a
producer called Rick something?

45:22.647 --> 45:23.642
He's making a film called The Hunted.

45:23.647 --> 45:24.642
Hold on.

45:24.647 --> 45:26.642
Yeah.

45:26.647 --> 45:27.642
Rick Moreweather.

45:27.647 --> 45:28.642
That's it.

45:28.647 --> 45:33.642
Okay, his office is just
past the water tower.

45:33.647 --> 45:34.642
But I'm not seeing your name here.

45:34.647 --> 45:36.647
- Do you have a driveon?
- I do.

45:40.647 --> 45:42.642
What's a driveon?

45:42.647 --> 45:44.642
Okay, sir, you're gonna
need to pull around the booth

45:44.647 --> 45:46.642
and exit this side.

45:46.647 --> 45:49.642
What are they doing? How's
it they're all getting in?

45:49.647 --> 45:51.642
They're here to see Rachael Ray.

45:51.647 --> 45:53.642
Shut the...

45:53.647 --> 45:54.642
Rachael Ray films here?

45:54.647 --> 45:55.642
Yeah, West Coast taping,

45:55.647 --> 45:58.642
but, sir, there's people behind you.

45:58.647 --> 45:59.642
Can I get a ticket for Rachael Ray?

45:59.647 --> 46:01.642
Okay, there's a standby list.

46:01.647 --> 46:03.647
But right now, you're
gonna need to make a Uturn.

46:05.647 --> 46:07.642
Sir, there's people behind you.

46:11.647 --> 46:14.642
Hi. Miles Daly for Rick Moreweather.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.642
Do you have an appointment?

46:16.647 --> 46:17.647
Nobody called about you.

46:21.647 --> 46:24.642
You know what it is?

46:24.647 --> 46:28.647
My assistant, Clarisa. She
going through a breakup.

46:29.647 --> 46:32.642
It's messed up my whole week.

46:32.647 --> 46:33.642
You think there's any
way that Rick might be

46:33.647 --> 46:35.647
able to see me since I'm here?

46:36.647 --> 46:39.642
He's got a full schedule.

46:40.647 --> 46:43.642
But have a seat, I'll check. Mister...

46:43.647 --> 46:45.647
Miles Daly.

46:46.647 --> 46:47.647
Thank you.

47:03.647 --> 47:04.647
You an actress?

47:05.647 --> 47:09.642
Me? God, no.

47:11.647 --> 47:13.642
I just figured anyone attractive

47:13.647 --> 47:14.647
in LA is an actress,

47:16.647 --> 47:17.642
but not in your case.

47:17.647 --> 47:19.642
No.

47:19.647 --> 47:20.647
No.

47:24.647 --> 47:25.647
What do you do?

47:26.647 --> 47:27.642
I'm an executive.

47:27.647 --> 47:29.647
- No shit.
- Yeah.

47:32.647 --> 47:33.647
What does that mean?

47:34.647 --> 47:37.642
What's an executive?

47:37.647 --> 47:39.642
Well...

47:39.647 --> 47:43.647
I oversee producers who
make films for my studio.

47:44.647 --> 47:45.642
Which is?

47:45.647 --> 47:46.642
Gravity Pictures International.

47:46.647 --> 47:48.647
- Right.
- Yeah.

47:53.647 --> 47:54.647
What do you do?

47:57.647 --> 47:59.620
I'm a film producer.

48:01.647 --> 48:03.642
As of three hours ago.

48:06.647 --> 48:08.642
And, how's that going?

48:08.647 --> 48:11.642
- Good.
- Yeah?

48:11.647 --> 48:13.642
Miss Quinn, you can go on in.

48:13.647 --> 48:15.647
Great.

48:17.647 --> 48:18.647
Well, good luck.

48:20.647 --> 48:22.642
Maybe we'll work together sometime.

48:22.647 --> 48:25.647
You never know. It's a small town.

48:28.647 --> 48:29.642
What a happy surprise.

48:29.647 --> 48:31.642
Come on, grab a seat.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.642
No, I'd love to stay, but I can't.

48:33.647 --> 48:36.642
I just wanted to tell you I
tried to move Tyler's work.

48:36.647 --> 48:40.642
Made a dozen calls. At least two calls.

48:40.647 --> 48:43.642
- And?
- Oof. So many moving parts.

48:43.647 --> 48:45.642
We've, we've got
a location in Minsk.

48:45.647 --> 48:48.642
The Pentagon is loaning us a submarine.

48:48.647 --> 48:50.642
So, you know, we got to get that back...

48:50.647 --> 48:51.642
- April, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- I can't, I...

48:51.647 --> 48:53.642
No, just for a second. Come here.

48:53.647 --> 48:54.642
Come on.

48:54.647 --> 48:57.642
Sit down, all right.

48:57.647 --> 48:59.642
Okay, I'm not happy saying this,

48:59.647 --> 49:02.642
but just as your friend.

49:02.647 --> 49:04.642
You don't want Tyler in your movie.

49:04.647 --> 49:06.642
Why not?

49:06.647 --> 49:07.642
Did you know he brings

49:07.647 --> 49:10.642
gay prostitutes into the trailer?

49:10.647 --> 49:12.642
Yes.

49:12.647 --> 49:17.647
Okay. And he does hard drugs.

49:18.647 --> 49:19.647
What kind?

49:20.647 --> 49:22.647
What kind? Opium.

49:23.647 --> 49:25.642
Yeah, he smokes it.

49:25.647 --> 49:27.893
I know when you're bullshitting, Rick.

49:27.899 --> 49:28.642
No, no.

49:28.647 --> 49:29.642
I worked for you.

49:29.647 --> 49:31.642
- I got to go to this screening now.
- I'm not bullshitting.

49:31.647 --> 49:34.642
Let's get lunch next week.
No, no, no. Not next week.

49:34.647 --> 49:35.642
I'm gonna have Marsha set it up, okay?

49:35.647 --> 49:37.642
It was great to see you.

49:37.647 --> 49:38.647
No, wait!

49:43.647 --> 49:46.647
I, I spent three years
getting this film going.

49:48.647 --> 49:51.642
I've nothing in development.

49:51.647 --> 49:55.647
If... If I shut down
now, I lose investors.

50:03.647 --> 50:04.647
April...

50:06.647 --> 50:07.647
Please.

50:10.647 --> 50:12.647
I'm sorry.

50:14.647 --> 50:15.647
I am.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.647
But you'll figure it out.

50:19.647 --> 50:20.647
I know you will.

50:28.647 --> 50:30.647
- Take care.
- Thank you.

50:31.647 --> 50:32.647
See you.

50:33.647 --> 50:34.647
Bye.

50:42.647 --> 50:43.642
Any word?

50:43.647 --> 50:45.642
Like I said, he's got a full schedule.

50:47.647 --> 50:48.642
I'll give him a try.

50:48.647 --> 50:50.647
I appreciate that.

51:01.647 --> 51:02.647
Is that him?

51:04.647 --> 51:05.647
Okay.

51:13.647 --> 51:16.642
Mr. Moreweather, I'm
sure you're really busy.

51:16.647 --> 51:18.642
But I have a script I just
know you're gonna love.

51:18.647 --> 51:19.642
Leave it with Gladys. Please.

51:19.647 --> 51:21.642
It's quicker if I
just tell you about it.

51:21.647 --> 51:24.642
So the story takes place in
the olden days, in Europe.

51:24.647 --> 51:26.642
And there's this young
guy, an Irish guy actually.

51:26.647 --> 51:28.642
And he's in love with
this beautiful girl.

51:28.647 --> 51:31.642
But he loses her because
he has to go to war.

51:31.647 --> 51:33.642
And he sees some terrible shit.

51:33.647 --> 51:36.642
And he does some terrible shit.

51:36.647 --> 51:37.642
And by the time he comes
home looking for her,

51:37.647 --> 51:40.642
he's too fucked up in
the head to connect.

51:40.647 --> 51:42.642
So he needs to find that part of himself

51:42.647 --> 51:44.647
that remembers how to love.

51:46.647 --> 51:48.647
And you know, there's funny bits.

51:51.647 --> 51:54.647
- Who are you?
- Miles Daly.

51:57.647 --> 51:58.642
Did you eat off it?

51:58.647 --> 52:03.642
Look, Miles, it's a bad time. Thanks.

52:03.647 --> 52:05.642
Listen, Rick.

52:05.647 --> 52:09.642
I'd produce this myself, but
I've never done it before.

52:09.647 --> 52:10.642
And I thought, who'd be into this?

52:10.647 --> 52:12.642
Rick fuckin' Moreweather.

52:12.647 --> 52:14.642
So I do the legwork, you advise me.

52:14.647 --> 52:16.647
And we split the profits.

52:19.647 --> 52:22.642
Listen. I make straighttovideo movies.

52:22.647 --> 52:24.642
Budgets of 5 to 10 million.

52:24.647 --> 52:27.642
Stuff that sells in Germany and Japan.

52:27.647 --> 52:30.642
I can't finance a period drama.

52:30.647 --> 52:32.647
If I did, I'd lose my shirt.

52:41.647 --> 52:42.647
Best of luck.

52:44.647 --> 52:45.647
I mean that.

53:08.647 --> 53:11.642
Hey. Everything all right?

53:11.647 --> 53:13.642
I haven't seen Yago.

53:13.647 --> 53:15.647
But we got work at the warehouse.

53:16.647 --> 53:17.642
Can it keep a few hours?

53:17.647 --> 53:20.642
I guess so.

53:20.647 --> 53:23.642
Amara met with a new business partner.

53:23.647 --> 53:24.642
Didn't work out.

53:24.647 --> 53:26.642
Who?

53:26.647 --> 53:29.642
Potential front for our
cash, now that Jason's gone.

53:29.647 --> 53:30.647
That's what Ed told me.

53:31.647 --> 53:33.642
So what happened?

53:33.647 --> 53:35.642
I don't know.
Where are you, anyway?

53:35.647 --> 53:37.642
I'm heading back from LA.

53:37.647 --> 53:39.642
LA? Why the fuck are you in LA?

53:39.647 --> 53:40.642
I'll tell you when I get there.

53:40.647 --> 53:42.647
What is in...

54:37.647 --> 54:40.647
Amara. Is this a bad time?

54:42.647 --> 54:44.642
For what?

54:44.647 --> 54:47.642
I just wanted to talk
over something with you.

54:47.647 --> 54:49.647
An idea.

54:50.647 --> 54:51.647
In the car.

55:02.647 --> 55:06.647
You're in front.

55:07.647 --> 55:09.647
I'm not angry.

55:10.647 --> 55:12.642
- No?
- No.

55:12.647 --> 55:14.647
It's water under the bridge.

55:15.647 --> 55:16.647
Get in.

55:17.647 --> 55:21.642
You know, we can
always do this later.

55:21.647 --> 55:23.647
I should really get to the warehouse.

55:24.647 --> 55:25.647
We drop you off.

56:09.647 --> 56:11.647
So?

56:12.647 --> 56:14.647
So, um...

56:15.647 --> 56:19.642
Yeah, I know we're not running cash

56:19.647 --> 56:22.642
through the casino, because of the Feds.

56:22.647 --> 56:25.642
And I heard the new guy didn't work out.

56:25.647 --> 56:27.642
But I met a producer in LA.

56:27.647 --> 56:29.642
He makes movies, nothing
you'd have heard of.

56:29.647 --> 56:32.642
He had investors who front the money,

56:32.647 --> 56:35.642
maybe 5 to 10 million per movie.

56:35.647 --> 56:37.642
And he sells it overseas.

56:37.647 --> 56:39.642
And I thought,

56:39.647 --> 56:42.647
could be a good way to
make your cash flow legit.

56:46.647 --> 56:48.647
I don't understand.

56:51.647 --> 56:52.647
Um...

56:56.647 --> 57:02.642
You'd finance one of his
movies as a silent partner.

57:02.647 --> 57:04.642
And he'd sell it, you'd recoup.

57:04.647 --> 57:06.642
You'd pay tax on those earnings,

57:06.647 --> 57:08.642
but that money,

57:08.647 --> 57:10.647
all of that money, would be clean.

57:18.647 --> 57:19.647
And this is your idea?

57:22.107 --> 57:23.107
Yeah.

57:30.647 --> 57:31.647
What movie?

58:15.647 --> 58:16.647
I like John Stamos.

58:20.647 --> 58:21.647
Excuse me?

58:22.647 --> 58:24.647
You know John Stamos?

58:27.647 --> 58:29.642
The actor?

58:29.647 --> 58:30.647
Could he be in this?

58:31.647 --> 58:34.647
Yeah, definitely.

58:36.647 --> 58:37.647
Good idea.

58:46.647 --> 58:47.647
I'll think about it.

58:51.281 --> 58:53.276
Great.

59:39.647 --> 59:43.647
It's such an unbelievably terrible idea.

59:45.647 --> 59:47.647
I... I really don't know what to say.

59:48.647 --> 59:50.642
You'll be in business with Amara?

59:50.647 --> 59:52.642
Maybe.

59:52.647 --> 59:53.767
How'd that work out for him?

59:55.647 --> 01:00:00.647
Hey, buddy. Do you think
this is a good idea?

01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:08.642
Everybody in show business
has a different story

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:09.642
about how they broke in.

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:12.642
Maybe this is our way.

01:00:12.647 --> 01:00:13.647
- "Our" way?
- Yeah.

01:00:14.647 --> 01:00:16.642
No, no. No. No.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:18.647
You know what, I don't
even wanna hear about this.

01:00:20.647 --> 01:00:25.642
You know, when it's you on that tarp,

01:00:25.647 --> 01:00:28.647
I am gonna be sad, but it won't be me.

01:00:30.647 --> 01:00:32.647
I'm gonna make a call.

01:00:39.647 --> 01:00:40.642
Hi.

01:00:40.647 --> 01:00:42.642
Hey! Just saying good night.

01:00:42.647 --> 01:00:45.642
And how amazing you were in your play.

01:00:45.647 --> 01:00:46.642
Thanks.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:47.642
Speaking of which, I
told you I was going

01:00:47.647 --> 01:00:49.642
to Hollywood, right?

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:54.642
Well, I met an actor and,
and a writer and a producer.

01:00:54.647 --> 01:00:55.642
Where?

01:00:55.647 --> 01:00:57.647
People like
that are all over LA.

01:00:58.647 --> 01:00:59.642
Who's that?

01:00:59.647 --> 01:01:00.642
It's Dad.

01:01:00.647 --> 01:01:02.647
Well, tell him you're going to bed.

01:01:03.647 --> 01:01:04.647
Bye, Mom.

01:01:06.647 --> 01:01:08.642
Hey, um, I gotta go.

01:01:08.647 --> 01:01:11.642
And I'm sorry about
Jeffrey. I... I didn't know.

01:01:11.647 --> 01:01:13.642
Listen...

01:01:13.647 --> 01:01:14.642
Me and your mom are having

01:01:14.647 --> 01:01:15.642
a few little issues at the moment.

01:01:15.647 --> 01:01:16.642
But I have a feeling that

01:01:16.647 --> 01:01:18.647
everything's gonna work out fine.

01:01:20.647 --> 01:01:21.647
Night, shorty.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:24.647
Love you.

01:01:26.647 --> 01:01:27.647
Love you, too.
