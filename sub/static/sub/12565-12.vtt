00:00.035 --> 00:01.889
Previously on Royal Pains...

00:01.889 --> 00:03.523
Now with Hanklab gone, are we going to have

00:03.657 --> 00:05.425
to plead with the hospital
for more reasonable rates?

00:05.559 --> 00:06.626
No, not yet.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.228
I'm actually working on Hanklab Mach II.

00:08.362 --> 00:09.596
Good morning, Boris.

00:09.730 --> 00:11.130
I have a business proposal
I want to discuss with you.

00:11.265 --> 00:12.799
Hi. I'm Charlotte.

00:12.933 --> 00:14.701
Are you in town just to see Hank?

00:14.802 --> 00:16.469
I'm also here to consult with a surgeon

00:16.570 --> 00:18.905
that Hank knows who
does corneal transplants.

00:19.006 --> 00:21.574
You hired the lawyer, the
one that helped Viviana.

00:21.675 --> 00:24.310
I had to do something to
make up for interfering.

00:27.681 --> 00:29.315
Cinco's parents are suing Hankmed.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.550
You know that picture of you

00:30.684 --> 00:31.884
sticking a needle into Cinco's ass?

00:32.019 --> 00:33.653
They saw that, and now
they're out for blood.

00:33.754 --> 00:35.989
Emma, did you sell that photo of
Cinco and me to Snarkhampton?

00:36.123 --> 00:37.857
I sent that photo

00:37.992 --> 00:39.492
to some of the people who were at the party.

00:39.627 --> 00:41.995
One of them must've sold it to Snarkhampton.

00:42.096 --> 00:45.498
Is there anything else we should know about?

00:45.633 --> 00:47.166
No.

00:47.301 --> 00:48.301
Hey, guys.

00:48.435 --> 00:50.103
One of my prescription pads is missing.

00:50.237 --> 00:51.337
Did either one of you take it?

00:51.472 --> 00:53.172
Was anyone here while we were in Argentina?

00:53.307 --> 00:55.675
Not that I know of, just Emma.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.720 --> 01:09.989
48, 49, 50. Yep, 50.

01:10.124 --> 01:11.658
50.

01:14.995 --> 01:16.329
I could've done this by myself, you know.

01:16.463 --> 01:17.864
You should be with Charlotte.

01:17.998 --> 01:19.499
She may be seeing for the first time

01:19.633 --> 01:21.467
since she was five... That's a big deal.

01:21.602 --> 01:23.536
Yeah, well, this Emma
issue is a big deal too.

01:23.671 --> 01:25.038
Well, no pills are missing.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.873
Oh, so she only took a prescription pad.

01:27.007 --> 01:29.742
If she took the pad.

01:29.877 --> 01:31.177
Okay, she probably took the pad.

01:31.312 --> 01:33.479
This is so much worse than
selling pictures to a website.

01:33.614 --> 01:36.549
I mean, she put our business in
jeopardy, my medical license.

01:36.684 --> 01:38.251
She broke the law. Why?

01:38.385 --> 01:40.119
- Why would she do that?
- Probably money.

01:40.254 --> 01:42.655
Well, there are better ways to make money.

01:42.756 --> 01:44.957
Yeah, but she grew up
learning to make an easy buck.

01:45.059 --> 01:46.292
Think about it.

01:46.393 --> 01:48.328
She's been scamming with
her mom since she was a kid.

01:48.462 --> 01:50.263
Yeah, I know, but I thought
she didn't want that.

01:50.364 --> 01:52.065
I thought she wanted to,
you know, fit in here.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.166
She does, but now she has

01:53.300 --> 01:54.767
all these wealthy, privileged friends.

01:54.868 --> 01:57.070
She probably thought she needed
money to keep up with them.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.072
Personally, I like the
idea of just blaming Cinco.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.306
No, no, no, it's not about blame.

02:00.441 --> 02:01.641
- We need to help her.
- I know...

02:01.775 --> 02:03.776
Or dad won't be the
only felon in the family.

02:03.877 --> 02:05.078
You know what?

02:05.179 --> 02:07.313
Let's sit down with Emma
tonight as a united front.

02:07.448 --> 02:08.747
We'll have a family summit.

02:08.848 --> 02:10.683
I feel like every time we
try asking her directly,

02:10.818 --> 02:12.318
she makes up a story, though.

02:12.453 --> 02:14.187
Again, she's had, like,
17 years of practice.

02:14.321 --> 02:15.788
- That's Emma now.
- Yeah?

02:15.923 --> 02:19.258
- Cinco needs help.
- Cinco?

02:19.360 --> 02:21.394
- You're not gonna see him, right?
- Yeah, of course I am.

02:21.528 --> 02:22.729
You can't see Cinco, Henry.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.630
His family is suing us.
They've declared war.

02:24.765 --> 02:26.232
I don't care if they invade Shadow Pond.

02:26.367 --> 02:27.934
He's a kid who needs a doctor.

02:28.068 --> 02:29.902
A doctor or a prescription?

02:30.003 --> 02:32.505
I guess I'll find out.

02:33.803 --> 02:34.440
Get it.

02:36.343 --> 02:37.910
Good boy, Labbie.

02:38.045 --> 02:39.245
Come on! Oh.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.880
Oh, come on, come on.

02:40.981 --> 02:43.416
Come on!

02:43.550 --> 02:45.985
Aww.

02:46.086 --> 02:48.421
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

02:48.555 --> 02:50.990
- THanks for coming.
- Yeah, I'm glad you texted.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.692
It gives me a chance
to invite you to dinner.

02:52.826 --> 02:54.961
Evan and I were kind of hoping
to do a family night tonight.

02:55.095 --> 02:55.995
Oh, I don't know if I can.

02:56.130 --> 02:57.463
- I might be seeing a friend.
- Ah.

02:57.598 --> 02:58.698
But come check out Cinco.

02:58.832 --> 03:00.032
His wrist has been killing him.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.067
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:01.201 --> 03:02.301
He says it's been getting worse

03:02.436 --> 03:03.469
over the last couple of days,

03:03.604 --> 03:05.071
but he's being all macho about it.

03:05.205 --> 03:06.406
I'm not being macho.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.341
Look, I'm really embarrassed
about the last time

03:08.475 --> 03:09.542
you had to come and help me...

03:09.676 --> 03:11.611
Our parents' lawsuit against Hankmed.

03:11.745 --> 03:13.413
Emma said I had to see
you. She's very persistent.

03:13.547 --> 03:14.614
Well, she's right.

03:14.748 --> 03:15.848
The brother-sister team.

03:15.983 --> 03:17.583
I get it... the dynamic duo,

03:17.718 --> 03:18.851
just like us, right, Parker?

03:18.986 --> 03:20.987
Whatever, Cinco. Your
tennis wrist is boring.

03:21.121 --> 03:23.723
I'm taking Labbie inside.
She's way overheating.

03:23.857 --> 03:26.559
Come here. Come here.

03:26.693 --> 03:27.860
She idolizes me.

03:27.995 --> 03:29.529
Ow! Okay, there it is.

03:29.663 --> 03:31.531
Can you, uh, give me something for this?

03:31.665 --> 03:33.499
Yeah, an X-ray.

03:40.674 --> 03:42.708
Voila.

03:42.843 --> 03:44.944
Our plan for the new and improved Hanklab...

03:45.045 --> 03:47.847
I think Boris is gonna love it.

03:47.981 --> 03:50.016
Why are we here if the
plan is all written out?

03:50.150 --> 03:51.684
Wouldn't Boris just review it and decide?

03:51.819 --> 03:53.753
No, he doesn't want to
scour over this dry material.

03:53.887 --> 03:54.887
He's got people to do that.

03:55.022 --> 03:56.656
I like to read everything.

03:56.790 --> 03:59.392
Well, big wigs like Boris...
They want to be sold.

03:59.493 --> 04:01.194
We just got to give him
a little song and dance.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.163
Can't sing or dance.

04:06.567 --> 04:09.302
Well, look, you're just here to
answer any medical questions.

04:09.436 --> 04:11.838
- Okay? That's all.
- Why not Hank?

04:11.972 --> 04:13.539
You're the medical director.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.875
And Hank would just think
we're hitting Boris up for money.

04:16.009 --> 04:17.009
We are.

04:17.144 --> 04:18.810
Yeah, as an investment, though.

04:18.946 --> 04:21.947
50% of a soon-to-be very
profitable medical lab...

04:22.082 --> 04:23.216
That's a home run.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.985
Gentlemen, good morning.

04:26.119 --> 04:27.920
Mr. Lawson.

04:28.021 --> 04:29.889
- Boris.
- Dr. Sacani.

04:30.023 --> 04:32.225
It's good to finally meet you in person.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.759
But you needn't have come all this way.

04:33.894 --> 04:36.162
You could've dropped
these off for me to read.

04:39.099 --> 04:40.333
Yeah?

04:41.935 --> 04:43.336
Here we go.

04:45.606 --> 04:46.939
Okay.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.580
Is he okay?

04:54.715 --> 04:57.316
Wow. You're actually concerned.

04:57.417 --> 04:58.918
No, it's just most girls are more worried

04:59.052 --> 05:00.920
I'll break my bank account, not my wrist.

05:01.054 --> 05:04.857
Well, I'm not most girls.

05:04.992 --> 05:07.159
Okay, so, um, I don't see a fracture.

05:07.294 --> 05:08.261
That's a relief.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.762
It could be carpal tunnel syndrome.

05:09.863 --> 05:11.097
Compression of the median nerve

05:11.198 --> 05:13.065
sometimes caused by repetitive stress.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.400
Like overtexting.

05:14.501 --> 05:15.968
That could be a contributing factor.

05:16.069 --> 05:17.303
Take ibuprofen.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.438
I'll give you some wrist
stretches and a splint to wear,

05:19.540 --> 05:20.773
but if that doesn't ease the pain,

05:20.908 --> 05:22.141
I'll refer you to a specialist.

05:22.242 --> 05:23.776
Okay.

05:23.911 --> 05:25.678
Oh, yeah, and I text too much?

05:25.812 --> 05:27.313
Is this about your new car?

05:27.414 --> 05:28.981
What new car?

05:29.116 --> 05:31.117
Oh, it was gonna be a surprise.

05:31.251 --> 05:32.385
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

05:32.519 --> 05:34.120
How can you afford a car?

05:34.254 --> 05:36.389
Autotrader. I got a good deal.

05:36.523 --> 05:38.658
Hey, don't be so modest.
You worked really hard.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.326
Your sister's amazing.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.028
Yeah.

05:42.129 --> 05:43.396
She is.

05:47.050 --> 05:49.368
THanks for doing this in the Hamptons, Dan.

05:49.503 --> 05:51.637
I know how important this is for Charlotte.

05:51.772 --> 05:53.339
How's it looking, Dr. Ellis?

05:53.473 --> 05:56.576
Yesterday's surgery went well...

05:56.677 --> 05:58.311
But you tell me.

06:15.529 --> 06:17.463
It's nice to see you.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.301
It's, uh...

06:22.436 --> 06:25.338
It's nice to be seen.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.448
Bye.

06:45.788 --> 06:48.690
Is something the matter?

06:48.791 --> 06:50.692
Rafa.

06:50.826 --> 06:54.195
He's asking for joint custody of Sashi.

06:54.296 --> 06:56.197
I thought Rafa wasn't interested in being

06:56.332 --> 06:57.799
- a hands-on father.
- So did I.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.802
He's being influenced by his mother.

07:00.903 --> 07:03.838
- I'm sure of it.
- What will you do?

07:03.939 --> 07:04.839
Rafa's Sashi's father.

07:04.940 --> 07:06.140
I want her to know him,

07:06.275 --> 07:10.445
but she is not going back to Argentina.

07:10.579 --> 07:14.515
Is there anything I can do to help?

07:14.617 --> 07:18.219
No, thank you.

07:19.655 --> 07:22.056
- Uh, should we see the patient?
- Yes, of course.

07:30.733 --> 07:31.833
- Divya.
- Hey, Chase.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.468
This is Dr. Sacani.

07:33.602 --> 07:35.169
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

07:35.304 --> 07:37.672
I like the name of your shop... Sharon...

07:37.773 --> 07:40.108
- The ferryman on the river Styx.
- Nice.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.344
Most people say "Sharon"
and think I can't spell.

07:43.479 --> 07:45.747
My business partner, Ron,
thought it sounded cool,

07:45.848 --> 07:49.284
but, uh, now he's gone, so...

07:49.418 --> 07:50.652
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:50.786 --> 07:53.121
Oh, no, no, no, he's not dead.

07:53.255 --> 07:57.525
He left to take a job sailing
with a charter yacht company.

07:57.626 --> 08:00.495
- That sounds exciting.
- I guess...

08:00.629 --> 08:02.563
Except it leaves me doing a two-man job,

08:02.698 --> 08:06.434
which is a lot less exciting
and more exhausting.

08:06.568 --> 08:07.936
What can we do for you?

08:08.070 --> 08:11.806
I've been having joint pain,
headaches, fatigue too,

08:11.941 --> 08:14.375
but I just figured it's
from all the extra work.

08:14.476 --> 08:15.710
Could you be inhaling the fumes

08:15.844 --> 08:17.011
from the chemicals that you use?

08:17.146 --> 08:18.212
I'm pretty careful.

08:20.516 --> 08:24.852
Ron sends these notifications
for his blog posts.

08:24.987 --> 08:27.555
He calls it "Ron's Captain's Vlog."

08:27.656 --> 08:29.057
What's a vlog?

08:29.191 --> 08:31.559
Video posts from the yacht,
which I don't have time to watch

08:31.694 --> 08:34.294
because I have all this extra work.

08:34.395 --> 08:37.097
So, uh, what do you guys think?

08:37.232 --> 08:40.702
You seem a little resentful.

08:40.836 --> 08:43.136
What do you think about my symptoms?

08:43.272 --> 08:44.505
It could be a number of things.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.673
We'll run some tests.

08:45.808 --> 08:47.075
And we'll give you an air monitor

08:47.209 --> 08:48.376
to attach to your coveralls

08:48.510 --> 08:50.178
while you're working
for the rest of the day.

08:51.847 --> 08:55.850
So that's the plan... family summit.

08:55.985 --> 08:57.518
I like the sound of it,

08:57.653 --> 09:00.321
but Emma's pretty good at
maneuvering around the truth.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.690
- I know.
- Listen, I adore her.

09:02.825 --> 09:04.959
But she's not gonna come clean easily.

09:05.060 --> 09:06.594
That's exactly what I told Hank.

09:06.729 --> 09:07.829
Hank knows.

09:07.963 --> 09:09.530
He's the one who hired
a P.I. to look into her

09:09.631 --> 09:10.999
when she first got here.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.768
Emma didn't fess up until she
was confronted with proof.

09:13.869 --> 09:16.604
Babe, you're a genius.

09:16.739 --> 09:19.273
That's what we'll do. We'll follow her...

09:19.408 --> 09:20.508
See what we can find out.

09:20.642 --> 09:22.310
Maybe get some undeniable evidence.

09:22.411 --> 09:23.578
Yeah.

09:23.679 --> 09:25.279
Besides, who knows how much
trouble she could get into

09:25.414 --> 09:26.547
- between now and then?
- Yeah.

09:26.682 --> 09:27.949
We'll be protecting her by following her.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.651
- It's the least we could do.
- All right.

09:30.786 --> 09:33.921
Okay, we'll put this here.

09:34.056 --> 09:36.090
Right there.

09:36.225 --> 09:38.993
All right, which of these are round?

09:44.299 --> 09:45.333
Huh.

09:47.936 --> 09:49.037
Nice.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.605
That's so strange.

09:50.739 --> 09:51.939
I can feel the curves,

09:52.074 --> 09:55.410
but visually I wouldn't
have said this was round.

09:55.544 --> 09:57.678
- Huh.
- Okay, I want to try again.

09:57.813 --> 09:59.614
Okay, all right, listen,

09:59.748 --> 10:02.350
you do have a session with the
occupational therapist tomorrow.

10:02.484 --> 10:03.551
Like I can wait.

10:03.685 --> 10:05.420
Besides, I've studied all the therapies.

10:05.554 --> 10:07.955
Mary likes socks of gray.

10:08.090 --> 10:09.657
Mary likes socks of gray...

10:09.792 --> 10:13.961
Matching, likeness, sorting,
ordering, and grouping.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.863
You studied too.

10:15.998 --> 10:18.099
Because I'm excited too.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.934
I just... I don't want
you to tire your eye out.

10:20.069 --> 10:21.135
It's fine.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.970
And besides, I really want to be off my cane

10:23.105 --> 10:24.038
in time for my trip home.

10:24.173 --> 10:26.340
Ugh.

10:26.475 --> 10:28.042
Still a speed demon.

10:28.177 --> 10:31.245
But you need to be realistic.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.948
Your face changes so much when you smile.

10:34.049 --> 10:38.319
Your cheeks get bigger.
Your eyes get smaller.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.155
- So much to see.
- Yeah.

10:50.099 --> 10:53.000
There she is.

10:53.135 --> 10:56.204
Oh, no, she's going for the pharmacy.

10:56.338 --> 10:57.839
Maybe she has a headache?

10:57.973 --> 11:01.075
Or maybe she's using Hank's
prescription pad to get drugs.

11:01.210 --> 11:04.245
We have to stop her
before she gets arrested.

11:04.379 --> 11:07.248
W-w-wait. She's not going in.

11:07.382 --> 11:09.250
Come on.

11:21.196 --> 11:23.498
- What is that?
- I don't know.

11:23.632 --> 11:26.100
We have to get closer.

11:28.904 --> 11:30.605
Sorry.

11:30.739 --> 11:33.441
Come on, come on.

11:40.716 --> 11:42.450
She's leaving something.

11:42.584 --> 11:45.052
I can't tell what it is.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.387
What...

11:46.488 --> 11:49.090
Is this a party? Come on, guys.

11:49.191 --> 11:51.959
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

11:52.094 --> 11:54.729
Evan, Paige. What are you doing?

11:54.830 --> 11:57.498
Uh, what are we doing? Um, bird watching.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.934
And you're the bird. What is that?

12:00.068 --> 12:01.969
What's what?

12:06.909 --> 12:09.277
What is this?

12:09.378 --> 12:10.945
- I can explain.
- I'm sure you can.

12:11.046 --> 12:13.381
The problem is your
explanations aren't always true.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.149
- Hank's prescription pad.
- No, it's not.

12:15.284 --> 12:17.318
Are you kidding? The evidence is right here.

12:17.452 --> 12:19.020
- We're looking at it.
- Okay, look closer.

12:19.154 --> 12:20.221
The first page is a copy I made,

12:20.355 --> 12:23.791
and the rest is just an ordinary notepad.

12:23.926 --> 12:25.860
She's telling the truth about that.

12:25.961 --> 12:27.628
- Where's the real one?
- It's at home.

12:27.763 --> 12:29.630
I'm gonna put it back.

12:29.765 --> 12:32.600
Why'd you take it in the first place?

12:32.701 --> 12:35.102
I'm trying to out Oz.

12:37.839 --> 12:40.942
I sold those pictures to Snarkhampton,

12:41.076 --> 12:42.143
but it was a huge mistake.

12:42.244 --> 12:43.844
Okay, you didn't just sell some pictures.

12:43.979 --> 12:45.379
You sold a misleading picture of Hank,

12:45.480 --> 12:47.548
one that could seriously
damage his reputation.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.550
I sent that photo 'cause I was mad at Cinco.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.520
I had no idea that Oz was
gonna focus so much on Hank.

12:52.654 --> 12:54.522
But that is exactly why I have to out Oz.

12:54.656 --> 12:56.324
I have to get the leverage
over him to force him

12:56.458 --> 12:57.592
to set the record straight.

12:57.726 --> 12:59.060
But in order to lure him out of hiding,

12:59.194 --> 13:01.128
I needed to tempt him
with something really big.

13:01.263 --> 13:03.431
- Hank's prescription pad?
- Gossip.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.900
Oz thinks that pad has
copies of all of the meds

13:06.034 --> 13:08.202
that Hank has been prescribing
to the Hamptons elite.

13:08.337 --> 13:10.705
Oz flipped over the chance
of getting his hands on it.

13:10.839 --> 13:13.241
Emma, do you know how
many laws you're breaking?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.042
Not to mention rules of common decency?

13:15.177 --> 13:17.011
I was never gonna let it get that far.

13:17.145 --> 13:18.613
I just needed to lure him out of hiding

13:18.747 --> 13:20.414
so that he would print a retraction.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.451
Okay, I'm a little worried about
how good you are at this.

13:23.552 --> 13:28.222
I am telling you guys the truth, I promise.

13:33.439 --> 13:35.202
__

13:46.270 --> 13:48.171
- Chase?
- Yeah?

13:48.305 --> 13:51.074
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:51.175 --> 13:53.743
Uh, we have good news.

13:53.877 --> 13:55.778
Your blood results came back clean...

13:55.913 --> 13:58.915
No rheumatological issues,
no nutritional deficiencies.

13:59.049 --> 14:01.384
That is good news.
In fact, that's great new...

14:01.485 --> 14:03.352
Maybe even the best news
I've ever heard today.

14:03.454 --> 14:05.621
Okay, I'll check the reading.
Where's the air monitor?

14:05.756 --> 14:07.223
On my coveralls.

14:07.357 --> 14:10.560
Oh, I have good news
too. I finished my boat.

14:10.694 --> 14:11.761
- Oh.
- No, no, no, not that one.

14:11.895 --> 14:13.096
I'm still waiting for the epoxy to kick.

14:13.230 --> 14:14.797
That's when it stops
being sticky to the touch.

14:14.932 --> 14:17.567
Anyway, I finished...

14:17.668 --> 14:21.137
My HMS Sussex...

14:21.238 --> 14:22.572
80 guns,

14:22.706 --> 14:24.941
10 tons of gold coins sank off
the coast of Gibraltar in 1694,

14:25.075 --> 14:27.043
and all but 2 of the 500 crew members died.

14:27.177 --> 14:28.044
That's terrible.

14:28.178 --> 14:29.512
No toxic vapor readings.

14:29.646 --> 14:31.080
I forgot how much I loved building models.

14:31.215 --> 14:33.216
Ron and I used to build models
all the time when we were kids,

14:33.350 --> 14:34.650
but then we started making real boats,

14:34.785 --> 14:36.452
and then he went off to sea in a real boat.

14:36.587 --> 14:37.787
The irony, right?

14:37.921 --> 14:39.222
Technically, that's not irony.

14:39.323 --> 14:42.592
Suddenly you seem to be a bit
more upbeat about Ron leaving.

14:42.693 --> 14:44.927
Because it's awesome!

14:45.062 --> 14:46.896
- Yeah.
- Chase seems altered.

14:46.997 --> 14:48.731
It's euphoria. It could be neurological.

14:48.832 --> 14:49.732
- Chase?
- Yeah?

14:49.833 --> 14:51.000
- Put down the Sussex.
- Okay.

14:51.135 --> 14:52.735
We're gonna have to take you to the hospital

14:52.870 --> 14:53.936
to get a head C.T.

14:54.071 --> 14:56.606
Yes! That is awesome!

14:56.740 --> 14:59.475
Let's go! Come on, I'll drive.

15:02.779 --> 15:05.648
The sky is such a different
blue to the water.

15:05.782 --> 15:08.618
I guess you'd call the
sky more of a sky blue,

15:08.752 --> 15:10.753
and the water more of a greenish blue,

15:10.854 --> 15:12.054
at least today.

15:12.189 --> 15:13.322
Are you saying I'm going

15:13.423 --> 15:15.458
to have to learn a whole new
vocabulary by tomorrow?

15:15.592 --> 15:16.926
Yep, afraid so.

15:17.060 --> 15:19.862
But there's a lot to learn. Be patient.

15:19.997 --> 15:21.264
I know that's not your strong suit.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.534
I love a challenge.

15:24.668 --> 15:27.336
Finish what you were saying about Emma.

15:27.471 --> 15:30.339
Oh.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.508
I do not like this frowning face

15:32.643 --> 15:34.477
as much as I like your smiling face.

15:34.611 --> 15:36.646
I'm sorry. It's just...

15:36.780 --> 15:38.948
When I watch Emma and Cinco,
they seem like such great kids,

15:39.082 --> 15:40.950
but it's hard to ignore the evidence

15:41.084 --> 15:42.652
right in front of my face, you know?

15:42.786 --> 15:44.086
Well, I know what you mean.

15:44.221 --> 15:47.023
You've told me five times
already that these dark stripes

15:47.124 --> 15:49.358
are just spaces between the boards,

15:49.459 --> 15:52.295
but they still feel like
something I should step over.

15:52.396 --> 15:53.863
Wait a second, I'm sorry.

15:53.997 --> 15:56.365
Are you admitting I was right,
you should've brought your cane,

15:56.500 --> 15:58.601
or saying I could be
making this Emma situation

15:58.735 --> 15:59.969
worse than it is?

16:00.103 --> 16:01.237
The latter.

16:01.371 --> 16:03.673
- Ah, okay.
- I like Emma.

16:03.807 --> 16:07.710
But I also remember what
I was like as a teenager.

16:07.811 --> 16:10.012
On your left.

16:13.116 --> 16:15.751
Your favorite sport in action.

16:15.886 --> 16:18.521
They were going so fast.

16:18.622 --> 16:20.223
Those bikes are moving considerably slower

16:20.357 --> 16:22.358
than you were in the mountains of France.

16:22.459 --> 16:26.762
Well, speed sure looks more
dangerous than it feels.

16:26.897 --> 16:29.899
I don't think I'll ever get
on another bike again.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.235
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

16:32.336 --> 16:35.238
But maybe you should go back to
the hotel and rest for a while.

16:35.372 --> 16:37.807
You've done a lot for your first day.

16:37.908 --> 16:40.943
Yeah. Yeah, please take me back.

17:07.704 --> 17:09.771
Eyes on the drop.

17:13.143 --> 17:14.777
Hey.

17:14.911 --> 17:16.412
We're gonna get this guy. I can feel it.

17:16.546 --> 17:18.114
Paige is gonna get the whole thing on video.

17:18.214 --> 17:19.315
- Yeah.
- Good.

17:19.449 --> 17:20.883
But first I'm gonna tell him off myself.

17:20.983 --> 17:22.451
I don't think you should approach him.

17:22.551 --> 17:23.886
Yeah, we know nothing about this guy.

17:23.987 --> 17:25.421
He could be dangerous. He
managed to get Hankmed sued.

17:25.521 --> 17:29.258
I know. And I know that outing
Oz isn't gonna fix everything,

17:29.359 --> 17:31.427
but hopefully it's gonna
make up for the stupid mistake

17:31.561 --> 17:33.362
of getting involved with
him in the first place.

17:33.497 --> 17:35.164
Why did you?

17:35.299 --> 17:37.033
I mean, the money was part of it.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.468
I made more than I ever did waitressing...

17:39.603 --> 17:41.671
Enough to buy my first car.

17:41.772 --> 17:42.972
You're getting a car?

17:43.073 --> 17:44.373
We could've helped you with that.

17:44.474 --> 17:45.875
I've never had my own car before,

17:46.009 --> 17:48.044
and this way, I'm not gonna
have to bum rides from people,

17:48.178 --> 17:49.445
and autotrader made it so easy

17:49.579 --> 17:51.480
that I didn't have to ask anybody for help.

17:51.615 --> 17:52.915
See?

17:53.016 --> 17:55.318
I just typed in all the features
I wanted, and then I saved it,

17:55.452 --> 17:57.286
and I waited for them to send me an alert

17:57.421 --> 18:00.823
when my perfect car came
through, which it did.

18:00.957 --> 18:02.058
That's cool.

18:03.046 --> 18:04.685
__

18:05.262 --> 18:07.830
Well, there's always tomorrow.

18:07.931 --> 18:09.198
Maybe.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.267
But what if Oz is just playing me?

18:11.401 --> 18:13.436
What if... what if he never shows up

18:13.537 --> 18:15.304
and I can't make this up to you guys?

18:15.405 --> 18:16.972
I feel like I have just made
one mistake after another

18:17.107 --> 18:18.341
since I got here.

18:18.475 --> 18:20.509
- Everybody makes mistakes.
- Emma, you're family.

18:20.644 --> 18:22.411
You don't have to make anything up to us.

18:22.512 --> 18:23.913
Yeah.

18:24.047 --> 18:27.316
What about to Hank?

18:27.417 --> 18:30.486
Yeah.

18:30.620 --> 18:33.956
Thanks for doing the follow-up.

18:34.057 --> 18:36.325
No, it's good that you
admitted Chase to the hospital.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.160
I think until we figure out

18:38.295 --> 18:39.929
what's causing his altered behavior,

18:40.063 --> 18:44.066
then he shouldn't be working with chemicals.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.935
Okay, Thank you, Divya.

18:49.706 --> 18:53.275
Thank you for coming, doctor.

18:53.377 --> 18:56.579
May I offer you a coffee or tea...

18:56.713 --> 18:58.147
Something herbal, perhaps?

18:58.248 --> 19:00.750
Do you have ovaltine?

19:00.851 --> 19:02.585
I think that can be arranged.

19:02.719 --> 19:03.886
Hansel...

19:04.020 --> 19:06.856
Ovaltine.

19:06.990 --> 19:11.794
So I imagine you're wondering
why I called you here, yeah?

19:29.446 --> 19:31.914
You have a message from Hank.

19:43.059 --> 19:44.260
Hey, it's me.

19:44.361 --> 19:46.295
Uh, listen, I'm almost
finished with this patient.

19:46.430 --> 19:49.231
I'm sorry if I sounded
overprotective when I left.

19:49.366 --> 19:52.535
I just... I don't like the idea of
you venturing out alone yet...

19:52.636 --> 19:54.437
As if I could stop you.

19:54.571 --> 19:57.206
Anyway, I'll be back soon.

20:27.337 --> 20:29.305
I thought he just said
carpal tunnel or something,

20:29.439 --> 20:31.574
but now his pinky and ring
finger are, like, totally numb.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.075
That is not normal.

20:33.210 --> 20:34.877
How are those needles gonna help?

20:35.011 --> 20:37.179
- Is he gonna lose his fingers?
- Uh, that's unlikely.

20:37.314 --> 20:38.714
Those two fingers you just mentioned

20:38.849 --> 20:40.182
are connected to the ulnar nerve.

20:40.283 --> 20:42.885
This E.M.G. will tell us if it's damaged.

20:42.986 --> 20:45.287
Okay, you're gonna feel a little pinch.

20:45.422 --> 20:48.858
I think Parker is hoping
for a horrible prognosis

20:48.992 --> 20:50.826
so she can scare our
parents into coming home.

20:50.961 --> 20:52.495
Actually, I already called both of them.

20:52.629 --> 20:54.463
Mom is only seven hours away, commercial,

20:54.564 --> 20:56.232
and dad and stepmonster have the jet.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.000
My baby sister is still
a bit of an optimist.

20:58.134 --> 21:00.135
Look, Parker, if they didn't
come home on my birthday

21:00.270 --> 21:01.670
when I was drugged out of my mind

21:01.805 --> 21:02.905
for all the Hamptons to see,

21:03.039 --> 21:04.473
I don't really think a little carpal tunnel

21:04.608 --> 21:05.841
is going to interrupt their vacays.

21:05.976 --> 21:07.643
Will you please just tell
her that I'll be fine?

21:07.777 --> 21:09.712
Well, I want a neurologist
to go over these results,

21:09.813 --> 21:12.014
but from what I can see,
there's no nerve damage.

21:12.148 --> 21:14.350
Uh, Parker, could you
give us a minute alone?

21:14.484 --> 21:17.553
Oh, my God, is it, like, sexually
transmitted or something?

21:17.687 --> 21:19.021
Never mind. Don't tell me.

21:19.155 --> 21:20.623
I can't handle the truth.

21:20.724 --> 21:22.658
Come on.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.527
So...

21:24.661 --> 21:28.130
Numbness can have many causes
and may resolve on its own,

21:28.265 --> 21:32.668
but recreational drug use
can result in numb extremities,

21:32.802 --> 21:35.938
which could signal serious
neurological problems.

21:36.039 --> 21:38.440
So you got to be honest with me, Cinco.

21:38.542 --> 21:42.011
Do you do drugs?

21:42.145 --> 21:43.546
No.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.947
I don't, okay?

21:45.081 --> 21:48.817
I really was dosed by someone
else at that party when...

21:50.253 --> 21:54.156
You had to inject my ass
in order to save my ass.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.494
Okay.

21:58.628 --> 22:01.096
Okay, I'll schedule an MRI
for first thing tomorrow.

22:01.231 --> 22:02.298
Thank you.

22:02.432 --> 22:03.899
You got it.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.937
Charlotte?

22:08.071 --> 22:11.874
You okay?

22:11.975 --> 22:13.709
I, uh... I called a couple times,

22:13.843 --> 22:16.845
and I didn't, uh...

22:18.315 --> 22:20.983
Charlotte?

22:21.117 --> 22:22.818
Charlotte.

22:27.157 --> 22:28.824
Oh, God. Charlotte!

22:30.119 --> 22:31.152
She's two days post-op.

22:31.253 --> 22:32.754
She's lost a significant amount of blood

22:32.888 --> 22:34.422
and could be going into hemorrhagic shock.

22:34.523 --> 22:36.324
You should do a CBC, PT/PTT, ABG,

22:36.425 --> 22:37.892
and type and crossmatch four units

22:37.994 --> 22:38.927
and a head and neck C.T.

22:39.061 --> 22:40.395
Yeah, she may need a transfusion.

22:40.496 --> 22:42.831
Wait. Wait, no, no, no transfusions.

22:42.965 --> 22:44.499
My ophthalmologist said something

22:44.634 --> 22:45.867
about them being bad for me.

22:46.002 --> 22:48.637
Yes, a transfusion could
activate your immune system,

22:48.771 --> 22:50.438
increasing the odds of your body rejecting

22:50.539 --> 22:53.375
the corneal transplant, but
you may need more blood,

22:53.509 --> 22:56.911
and right now saving
your life is more important.

22:57.046 --> 22:59.514
Listen, I know you're scared,

22:59.615 --> 23:03.451
but it's the right thing to do.

23:03.552 --> 23:04.753
Okay.

23:04.854 --> 23:06.187
Okay. Okay.

23:21.404 --> 23:22.804
Hey, Ev. Um...

23:22.938 --> 23:26.207
So, listen, it took all night,
but Charlotte's stabilized.

23:26.342 --> 23:29.010
It was, uh... it was a rough one.

23:29.145 --> 23:30.111
Anyway, sorry about having

23:30.246 --> 23:31.746
to cancel the Emma summit last night,

23:31.881 --> 23:33.682
but let's try to make it work tonight, okay?

23:33.816 --> 23:35.583
I will see you later.

23:46.162 --> 23:47.462
Hank, I was just about to call you.

23:47.596 --> 23:50.732
Cinco's worse. He can't
feel his hand, and...

23:50.866 --> 23:52.567
Uh, you went into my bag?

23:52.702 --> 23:54.302
Where did you get these?

23:54.437 --> 23:57.739
You mean Labbie's heartworm pills?

23:57.873 --> 23:59.541
We got them at the kennel
where he was boarded,

23:59.642 --> 24:01.676
and now I'm selling them
on the doggie black market.

24:01.811 --> 24:03.545
Oh, my God,

24:03.679 --> 24:06.281
you really think I'm some kind
of horrible person, don't you?

24:06.382 --> 24:09.918
No, no, I don't think you're
some kind of horrible person,

24:09.918 --> 24:10.835
but you've done some things

24:10.835 --> 24:11.786
that are more serious than you may know,

24:11.887 --> 24:13.788
like taking my...

24:13.923 --> 24:16.357
Wait a second. Cinco's dog has heartworm?

24:16.492 --> 24:18.893
- Yeah, why?
- And Cinco's worse.

24:18.994 --> 24:20.361
Yeah, he can't feel his hand.

24:20.496 --> 24:21.863
Wait. Do you think those
two things are connected?

24:21.997 --> 24:23.798
I do. And if I'm right,
we may not have much time.

24:23.899 --> 24:25.533
Come on.

24:25.634 --> 24:27.402
- Ah...
- Cinco. Hey.

24:27.536 --> 24:29.003
Let me take a look.

24:29.138 --> 24:32.474
Okay, okay, it looks weird,
and it feels weirder.

24:32.608 --> 24:34.409
Okay, it's cold.

24:34.543 --> 24:35.877
And there's no pulse.

24:36.011 --> 24:37.712
Hank, look, I do not want
to lose my hand, okay?

24:37.847 --> 24:39.647
Cinco, don't worry.
Hank's gonna figure it out.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.416
Well, can you figure it out faster, please?

24:41.550 --> 24:42.484
I'm trying. Stay calm.

24:42.618 --> 24:44.853
You're gonna be f... Wait. Here.

24:44.954 --> 24:47.689
What?

24:47.823 --> 24:49.691
Dirofilariasis.

24:49.749 --> 24:53.230
- What is that?
- You have the same thing Labbie does.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.063
- Come here. Have a seat.
- Uh, wait.

24:55.197 --> 24:57.265
Wait, wait. I have... I have heartworm?

24:57.366 --> 24:59.400
Yeah. Well, something like that.

24:59.535 --> 25:00.935
We're gonna take care of it right now.

25:01.070 --> 25:02.804
How?

25:02.938 --> 25:05.774
Just give me your hand. Put it right there.

25:05.908 --> 25:08.042
Okay.

25:08.177 --> 25:11.613
And this is Betadine. Okay.

25:13.849 --> 25:15.450
- What's that?
- Lidocaine.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.786
I'm gonna numb your wrist.

25:17.887 --> 25:19.754
Okay, you're gonna feel a pinch.

25:19.855 --> 25:21.623
Okay.

25:23.492 --> 25:24.793
- Ooh.
- Okay.

25:24.894 --> 25:26.861
Now I'm gonna make an incision.

25:31.534 --> 25:33.268
How is that possible?

25:33.402 --> 25:35.637
Cinco and his dog must've
both gotten insect bites

25:35.771 --> 25:37.972
at the same time, probably months ago.

25:38.107 --> 25:40.241
That's how heartworm is transmitted.

25:40.376 --> 25:42.443
In dogs, the larvae migrate
to the heart and vessels.

25:42.578 --> 25:43.945
In humans, they stay put.

25:44.079 --> 25:46.247
Uh, guys, you may not want to watch this.

25:46.382 --> 25:48.850
In humans, they stay put, and what?

25:48.984 --> 25:51.853
They grow into...

25:51.987 --> 25:53.922
this.

25:54.056 --> 25:55.290
Ugh.

25:55.424 --> 25:57.792
Oh, my God.

25:57.927 --> 25:59.260
Is that a worm?

25:59.395 --> 26:00.495
It's a worm.

26:00.596 --> 26:02.497
Can you... can you just
get it out of me, please?

26:02.631 --> 26:03.731
Yes. I need to go slow.

26:03.833 --> 26:05.433
I don't want it to break
and leave any in you.

26:05.568 --> 26:06.434
Okay, that's fine.

26:06.535 --> 26:07.769
Take your time, but just get it out.

26:07.903 --> 26:09.404
I will.

26:09.505 --> 26:11.706
See, the insects transmit the eggs,

26:11.807 --> 26:15.844
and this worm grew large
enough that it was pressing

26:15.978 --> 26:18.880
on your ulnar nerve,
causing pain and numbness,

26:18.981 --> 26:21.482
until, finally, it pressed on your artery,

26:21.617 --> 26:24.052
cutting off the circulation.

26:24.186 --> 26:26.621
- And...
- Oh, God.

26:26.755 --> 26:28.656
There's the worm.

26:28.757 --> 26:30.525
That thing was living in my wrist?

26:30.659 --> 26:32.026
That was living in your wrist.

26:32.161 --> 26:34.562
- That's so...
- Cool.

26:34.697 --> 26:36.397
Okay, that's not at all
what I was gonna say,

26:36.532 --> 26:39.434
but props on not vomiting, I guess.

26:39.535 --> 26:42.103
Hank, thank you so much
for figuring this out.

26:42.238 --> 26:43.571
You're welcome.

26:43.706 --> 26:45.673
I guess it's a good thing
you went snooping in my bag.

26:45.808 --> 26:47.909
Well, yeah, but this is
getting to be a bad habit...

26:48.010 --> 26:49.677
You guys coming to my rescue again,

26:49.778 --> 26:51.079
the dynamic duo.

26:57.419 --> 26:59.087
Why did he check himself
out of the hospital?

26:59.221 --> 27:00.221
And not answer his phone?

27:00.356 --> 27:01.923
Maybe he has a deadline on that boat,

27:02.057 --> 27:03.391
and he's trying to finish.

27:03.492 --> 27:06.194
Or not.

27:06.295 --> 27:07.495
Chase...

27:07.630 --> 27:08.897
Why didn't you stay at the hospital

27:09.031 --> 27:10.431
and finish being evaluated?

27:10.566 --> 27:12.667
Oh, because I felt better.

27:12.801 --> 27:15.236
And then I came here, and I didn't.

27:15.371 --> 27:16.671
How do you feel now?

27:16.805 --> 27:18.640
Oh, uh, heavy...

27:18.774 --> 27:19.841
And tired.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.409
Have you been working on your boat?

27:21.543 --> 27:23.278
Yeah, a little.

27:23.412 --> 27:25.546
But then I got, uh, dizzy

27:25.648 --> 27:28.883
and decided to sit down.

27:29.018 --> 27:32.754
It's just so nice out
here in the open water.

27:32.888 --> 27:35.723
I just wanted to lower the main and...

27:35.858 --> 27:37.892
drift for a while.

27:38.027 --> 27:40.128
Chase, we have to get
you back to the hospital

27:40.262 --> 27:41.729
as soon as we can.

27:41.830 --> 27:44.632
He's seizing.

27:44.767 --> 27:46.100
This doesn't make sense.

27:46.235 --> 27:48.269
He's showing symptoms of
organophosphate poisoning,

27:48.404 --> 27:50.104
and he's been exposed
to styrene from the resin

27:50.239 --> 27:51.606
he uses to build his boat.

27:51.740 --> 27:54.042
But the air monitor didn't show
any chemical concentration.

27:54.176 --> 27:55.343
The reading could be a mistake.

27:55.477 --> 27:56.477
The mask could be defective.

27:56.612 --> 27:58.413
I'll try to find it. You call 911.

28:17.132 --> 28:19.434
Chase was poisoned, but not by the styrene.

28:19.568 --> 28:22.103
It was the model glue.

28:27.546 --> 28:30.048
So they're gonna debride and
irrigate the affected area,

28:30.149 --> 28:32.851
which will prevent any infection
or foreign-body reaction.

28:32.985 --> 28:35.720
So, basically, they're gonna
"dewormify" your dirofilariasis.

28:35.855 --> 28:37.355
Show-off.

28:37.456 --> 28:39.491
And the whole thing shouldn't
take more than an hour.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.659
Well, Emma, if you want
to bolt from worm man,

28:41.794 --> 28:43.328
now's your chance.

28:43.429 --> 28:45.397
Well, I've dated a guy with a tattoo

28:45.498 --> 28:47.232
and another one with a nose ring,

28:47.366 --> 28:49.634
but never one who could spawn worms.

28:49.735 --> 28:52.103
- I think you're a keeper.
- "Spawn worms."

28:52.238 --> 28:54.172
Okay, this stays between us.

28:54.306 --> 28:56.040
Oh, yeah, you, me, and Instagram.

28:56.175 --> 28:57.208
Just kidding.

28:57.343 --> 28:59.844
Oh, what about Parker?
She would want to know.

28:59.945 --> 29:01.212
Especially not Parker.

29:01.313 --> 29:02.814
Let's just wait till I'm out of surgery.

29:02.948 --> 29:03.915
I don't know if you've noticed,

29:04.049 --> 29:05.383
but she can be a little high-strung.

29:05.518 --> 29:07.419
This could push her into
a full-blown breakdown,

29:07.553 --> 29:09.854
and the therapy bill's
already high enough as it is.

29:09.989 --> 29:11.256
Okay, well, in that case,

29:11.390 --> 29:13.458
it'll just be me and the
worm in the waiting room.

29:13.592 --> 29:15.126
I'm keeping him as a pet.

29:15.261 --> 29:16.728
And I named him Cinco Jr.,

29:16.829 --> 29:18.730
which, I guess, is technically seis.

29:21.066 --> 29:23.935
Oh, I actually have to go.

29:24.069 --> 29:25.904
- Someone's new car is here.
- Oh.

29:26.038 --> 29:27.672
But I'll be back by the time you wake up.

29:27.773 --> 29:30.041
Okay.

29:30.142 --> 29:31.576
Hey, where are they dropping it off?

29:31.710 --> 29:34.245
- Uh, by the Jitney stop.
- Oh, great.

29:34.380 --> 29:36.548
- I'll give you a lift.
- You're busy.

29:36.682 --> 29:38.950
It's fine. It's, like, 10 minutes away.

29:39.084 --> 29:40.919
I'll take a cab.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.124
Emma, I really want to believe you.

29:46.258 --> 29:48.460
I really want you to believe me too,

29:48.594 --> 29:51.696
but for some reason, I don't
think that's ever gonna happen.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.333
Look, I really have to go.

30:01.474 --> 30:03.908
It wasn't the big boats, Chase.

30:04.009 --> 30:05.109
It was the little ones.

30:05.244 --> 30:07.245
Yes, if you had worn your mask and monitor

30:07.379 --> 30:08.680
while building your model boats inside

30:08.814 --> 30:10.815
as you do with your larger ones outside,

30:10.916 --> 30:14.052
you wouldn't have been poisoned by the glue.

30:14.186 --> 30:16.354
Maybe I went too far
building the entire fleet.

30:16.455 --> 30:18.056
Maybe you were missing your friend.

30:18.190 --> 30:19.657
Maybe I like building boats.

30:19.792 --> 30:21.993
Maybe we're not getting anywhere.

30:22.094 --> 30:24.462
I looked up Ron's vlog.

30:24.597 --> 30:28.333
I would like to show you something.

30:28.434 --> 30:30.134
Look at this.

30:30.236 --> 30:31.503
It's history...

30:31.637 --> 30:33.905
Following the route
Odysseus took back to Ithaca

30:34.039 --> 30:35.707
after the Trojan war.

30:35.841 --> 30:37.275
Chase, you out there?

30:37.409 --> 30:38.910
You see this, buddy?

30:39.044 --> 30:40.712
It's better than anything I ever imagined.

30:40.846 --> 30:42.247
Wish you were here to experience it.

30:42.348 --> 30:44.849
Yeah, and I wish you were here
to help me run the business.

30:44.984 --> 30:49.754
We built this place together,
and then he just...

30:49.855 --> 30:51.589
took off

30:51.690 --> 30:54.559
and left me here alone. That's messed up.

30:54.660 --> 30:57.428
I never would have done
anything like that to him.

30:57.563 --> 30:59.197
Dreams can change.

30:59.331 --> 31:00.999
People can change.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.567
Ron looks happy.

31:02.701 --> 31:06.237
Yeah, well, one of us should be.

31:06.372 --> 31:09.874
I wonder if a friendship
can be like an organism

31:09.975 --> 31:11.843
and adapt to adversity.

31:11.977 --> 31:14.345
Sometimes friends go away or
something changes between you,

31:14.480 --> 31:16.915
but if you're really friends,
maybe the relationship

31:17.049 --> 31:21.486
can grow back stronger
where it was broken...

31:21.620 --> 31:24.222
Like a bone.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.226
That's really...

31:28.360 --> 31:29.961
nice.

31:30.095 --> 31:31.896
Yes, it is.

31:39.138 --> 31:42.073
That was very profound, Jeremiah.

31:44.276 --> 31:47.812
I know that our friendship has changed.

31:47.913 --> 31:49.480
But I do hope...

31:49.582 --> 31:52.650
I won't get on a boat and sail away.

31:54.687 --> 31:56.788
I'm glad to hear that.

31:56.922 --> 32:01.259
Speaking of surprises, um...

32:01.360 --> 32:04.228
I'd like to know what you think of Boris.

32:04.330 --> 32:05.797
Boris?

32:05.931 --> 32:07.932
That's a very opaque question.

32:08.033 --> 32:10.101
Why do you ask?

32:13.439 --> 32:15.940
Our triangulation is perfect.

32:16.075 --> 32:19.711
I don't see how Oz can escape.
I don't see how he can escape.

32:19.845 --> 32:22.013
Outing Oz isn't all this is about.

32:22.147 --> 32:25.016
I know.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.618
What else is this about?

32:26.752 --> 32:29.187
Gaining Emma's trust and her gaining ours,

32:29.288 --> 32:30.421
helping her turn things around.

32:30.522 --> 32:32.557
It'll be easier for her to stop the lying

32:32.691 --> 32:34.392
- if she knows we support her.
- Of course.

32:34.526 --> 32:38.062
Yeah.

32:38.197 --> 32:40.098
It's Emma.

32:50.109 --> 32:52.810
Film, film.

32:58.484 --> 33:00.718
Hey.

33:00.819 --> 33:02.553
Parker?

33:02.688 --> 33:04.922
You're Oz?

33:05.057 --> 33:07.191
Why would you be Oz?

33:07.326 --> 33:08.926
Ever since I was a kid,

33:09.061 --> 33:10.561
I've been a sucker for gossip.

33:10.663 --> 33:12.563
Yeah, you are our mother's daughter.

33:12.665 --> 33:14.766
And you know how much
she loves Snarkhampton.

33:14.900 --> 33:17.502
- Oh, so it's mom's fault.
- I'm not saying that.

33:17.636 --> 33:19.303
Good, because you did it.

33:19.405 --> 33:22.540
Parker, what were you thinking?

33:22.641 --> 33:26.344
First, I did it because
I knew mom would read it.

33:26.445 --> 33:29.113
And then she became such a fan.

33:29.248 --> 33:33.251
And she calls me every
morning to talk about it.

33:33.352 --> 33:35.053
She calls you?

33:35.187 --> 33:36.921
We talk about the site...

33:37.022 --> 33:38.222
and other stuff.

33:38.357 --> 33:42.126
We've been talking, Cinco, really talking...

33:42.261 --> 33:43.928
for the first time.

33:46.365 --> 33:48.566
You got mom's attention.

33:48.667 --> 33:52.370
But you did it at a lot of peoples' expense.

33:52.504 --> 33:53.638
I'm sorry.

33:53.772 --> 33:55.373
I didn't want to post the picture,

33:55.507 --> 33:59.544
but then I thought if mom
saw it, she'd show up.

33:59.678 --> 34:00.745
Please...

34:00.846 --> 34:03.214
Don't hate me, William.

34:03.348 --> 34:05.116
You're all I've got.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.585
Here...

34:10.989 --> 34:14.257
I got to say, you went
about it pretty brilliantly.

34:14.359 --> 34:16.094
I mean, I always knew you were smart.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.762
I didn't know you were so sneaky.

34:17.896 --> 34:19.362
Maybe I found my calling.

34:19.498 --> 34:21.264
Oh, not a chance in hell.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.867
We'll find another way

34:23.001 --> 34:25.503
for you to channel your wicked brilliance.

34:25.603 --> 34:27.871
And, hey, if you call me "William" again,

34:28.005 --> 34:31.208
I'll kill you.

34:41.186 --> 34:44.021
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:44.156 --> 34:46.056
How was the big talk with Emma?

34:46.190 --> 34:47.391
Oh, it's tonight.

34:47.525 --> 34:48.893
She had a busy day,

34:49.027 --> 34:51.195
but I think once she and
I can sit face-to-face,

34:51.330 --> 34:53.531
we can really start talking.

34:53.665 --> 34:55.132
What I wouldn't give for a busy day

34:55.234 --> 34:56.801
instead of stuck in this hospital bed.

34:56.935 --> 35:00.238
It won't be for long.

35:00.372 --> 35:02.573
And...

35:02.674 --> 35:05.843
I have something for when you get out.

35:05.978 --> 35:10.248
Present? Why didn't you say so?

35:10.349 --> 35:13.284
That's right. Get in there.

35:20.159 --> 35:23.094
My own cane that I've used for six years.

35:23.195 --> 35:25.463
Why, you shouldn't have.

35:25.564 --> 35:28.032
The box is new, so...

35:28.167 --> 35:31.402
Look, I know it's not exactly romantic,

35:31.537 --> 35:34.472
but your recovery is gonna take patience.

35:34.573 --> 35:36.941
This time you can't push
yourself too hard too fast.

35:37.075 --> 35:39.177
Hey, I would love to take it easy,

35:39.311 --> 35:40.278
but, you know, my business...

35:40.379 --> 35:43.247
Stop. Just... just stop it.

35:43.348 --> 35:44.916
Close your eyes.

35:45.050 --> 35:46.851
Really? You're gonna steal my move now?

35:46.985 --> 35:49.387
Yeah, that's right. I'm stealing your move.

35:49.521 --> 35:52.523
Close 'em...

35:52.658 --> 35:55.059
And listen.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.261
I know you're a speed demon.

35:57.396 --> 35:59.664
It's one of the many
things I love about you.

35:59.798 --> 36:02.433
I don't want to discourage that.

36:02.568 --> 36:05.536
I just want you to be patient.

36:05.671 --> 36:08.906
And I want to be with you
every step of the way.

36:11.610 --> 36:15.012
- Can I open my eyes now?
- Yes, you can open your eyes.

36:17.716 --> 36:19.884
I heard you.

36:20.018 --> 36:22.253
Thank you.

36:24.456 --> 36:27.024
That is the single most repulsive thing

36:27.159 --> 36:28.092
I have ever seen.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.027
I know, but isn't it amazing?

36:30.128 --> 36:32.063
Lest we forget that Emma's
brother is a doctor,

36:32.197 --> 36:33.631
nerves of steel run in the family.

36:33.765 --> 36:35.433
They do, actually, yes.

36:35.567 --> 36:38.502
Yeah, about that, I'm really
sorry about how the picture

36:38.637 --> 36:39.904
of Cinco's butt played out.

36:40.038 --> 36:43.174
I never meant for your brother
to get in so much trouble.

36:43.275 --> 36:45.109
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

36:45.244 --> 36:48.713
I am just really glad that it's over.

36:50.315 --> 36:51.949
How did you get that picture?

36:52.050 --> 36:55.219
Emma took it. She was my biggest source.

37:01.326 --> 37:03.427
Is that the reason you
even came to my party?

37:03.562 --> 37:06.163
No, no. No, it's not.

37:06.298 --> 37:08.933
No, but the photo op was part of it.

37:11.937 --> 37:13.170
I...

37:13.305 --> 37:14.906
I guess you're not that different

37:15.040 --> 37:17.575
from the girls around here after all.

37:22.446 --> 37:23.847
I don't know which concerns me more...

37:23.981 --> 37:25.415
That we're being summoned to see Boris

37:25.516 --> 37:27.283
or that you know what's
going on and I don't.

37:27.418 --> 37:28.918
I think you know which concerns you more.

37:29.053 --> 37:30.587
Patience, Henry.

37:30.688 --> 37:32.155
All in due time.

37:32.289 --> 37:33.823
I'd be a lot more patient if you
just tell me why we're here.

37:33.958 --> 37:35.025
No.

37:35.159 --> 37:36.893
I think you'll both be in for a surprise.

37:37.028 --> 37:38.962
Huh?

37:39.096 --> 37:40.130
Ah.

37:40.264 --> 37:42.098
Here we are.

37:42.233 --> 37:43.667
Jeremiah.

37:43.801 --> 37:45.869
Hello, Evan.

37:49.874 --> 37:51.875
THank you all for coming.

37:52.009 --> 37:55.779
Let's get right to it, shall we?

37:55.913 --> 38:00.684
Hankmed has been operating on
this property for several years,

38:00.818 --> 38:04.988
but I'm only now seeing it's
not just the sum of the parts,

38:05.089 --> 38:07.524
but the parts themselves

38:07.658 --> 38:09.526
that make your company so special.

38:09.660 --> 38:12.028
Ms. Katdare, I'm grateful to you

38:12.129 --> 38:15.098
for introducing me to the
notion of orphan diseases.

38:15.232 --> 38:17.000
You're welcome.

38:17.134 --> 38:18.368
And Dr. Sa...

38:18.502 --> 38:21.604
Jeremiah, your most thorough explanation

38:21.706 --> 38:24.374
of how research centers
operate was inspiring,

38:24.508 --> 38:25.875
to say the least. I thank you.

38:26.010 --> 38:27.577
Oh, my pleasure, Boris.

38:27.712 --> 38:30.013
Evan R. Lawson, I'd like to thank you

38:30.147 --> 38:33.283
for bringing me your Hanklab
business opportunity.

38:33.384 --> 38:38.088
Your due diligence and attention
to detail was most impressive.

38:38.222 --> 38:40.423
No problem.

38:40.524 --> 38:44.728
Hank, let me thank you for, um...

38:44.862 --> 38:47.197
everything you've done for me and my family.

38:47.331 --> 38:49.332
You're very welcome.

38:49.467 --> 38:51.801
I am purchasing Hamptons Heritage

38:51.936 --> 38:54.237
from Symphony Health Systems.

38:54.371 --> 38:57.040
The paperwork should be done shortly, and...

38:57.141 --> 39:01.277
Wait. You're buying the hospital...

39:01.412 --> 39:02.746
the whole hospital?

39:02.880 --> 39:05.682
Yeah, as of this month.

39:05.816 --> 39:07.584
And I would like all of you

39:07.718 --> 39:10.920
to serve on the hospital's
board of directors.

39:11.055 --> 39:14.090
I would need to rely on
your extensive knowledge.

39:14.225 --> 39:17.961
And while I understand you
all have full-time employment,

39:18.095 --> 39:22.031
this would entail a generous stipend.

39:22.166 --> 39:23.900
Jeremiah has already agreed.

39:24.034 --> 39:26.369
Ms. Katdare?

39:26.504 --> 39:27.504
Thank you, Boris.

39:27.605 --> 39:32.008
Uh, it's quite an offer and an honor.

39:32.143 --> 39:36.446
Excellent. Evan, what do you say?

39:36.580 --> 39:38.848
I say yes.

39:38.983 --> 39:39.916
Hell, yes.

39:40.050 --> 39:41.618
Hell, yes.

39:41.752 --> 39:43.820
And, Hank.

39:43.954 --> 39:46.156
Um, it is quite an offer

39:46.257 --> 39:49.959
and quite an amazing commitment
you've made to this community.

39:52.163 --> 39:55.098
But I'm afraid my answer's no.

39:55.232 --> 39:57.500
I'm sorry.

40:00.104 --> 40:01.471
Yeah.

40:01.605 --> 40:03.306
Then it would seem you're excused

40:03.440 --> 40:05.575
from the remainder of this conversation.

40:08.612 --> 40:10.346
Okay.

40:29.533 --> 40:32.602
Well, look at you.

40:32.703 --> 40:34.604
Yeah. Look at me.

40:34.738 --> 40:36.940
Who knew you had such
excellent taste in cars?

40:37.074 --> 40:39.509
I thought you would like it.

40:39.610 --> 40:40.877
I do.

40:41.011 --> 40:43.413
I figured that your car
brought you a pretty good life,

40:43.547 --> 40:45.315
and I'm just hoping for
a little bit of the same.

40:45.416 --> 40:49.285
Well, I have no doubt it will.

40:49.420 --> 40:50.954
Listen...

40:51.055 --> 40:53.890
I'd love for us to talk about life.

40:53.991 --> 40:56.125
We need to clear some things up.

40:56.227 --> 40:57.894
Yeah. Yeah, I would love that.

40:58.028 --> 41:00.129
That sounds great.

41:01.298 --> 41:02.565
Oh, do you mean right now?

41:02.666 --> 41:04.934
I did. I did, but you seem pretty excited

41:05.035 --> 41:08.171
to take your new car for a spin,
so, uh, let's have dinner later.

41:08.305 --> 41:09.339
- We could talk then.
- Great.

41:09.473 --> 41:11.241
Evan will be able to be there too.

41:11.375 --> 41:12.976
Sounds good. Thanks.

41:13.077 --> 41:16.212
Yeah.

41:19.717 --> 41:22.252
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

41:25.556 --> 41:28.157
- Emma, your seat belt!
- Got it.

41:41.572 --> 41:44.274
Hi. This is Emma. Leave a message.

41:48.746 --> 41:51.247
Emma, dinner's here!

41:51.382 --> 41:53.283
And after our Emma summit,

41:53.384 --> 41:55.017
you and I are gonna have a Hank summit,

41:55.077 --> 41:56.709
and you are gonna tell me about Boris.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.638
Damn it.

41:59.394 --> 42:00.574
Everything ok?

42:01.166 --> 42:03.509
Emma took her new car for a spin.

42:03.562 --> 42:04.859
She didn't come back.

42:05.072 --> 42:06.864
So? Did you call her?

42:06.913 --> 42:08.634
Yeah, she's not answering her cell.

42:08.670 --> 42:09.901
Let's go to her room.

42:09.949 --> 42:11.267
I did.

42:11.311 --> 42:12.475
It's empty.

42:12.508 --> 42:13.518
Huh?

42:13.797 --> 42:15.435
All her stuff is gone.

42:16.556 --> 42:18.050
And so is she.
