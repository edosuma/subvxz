You're going to do what?

00:53.150 --> 00:54.480
In the upcoming KillA show,

00:54.480 --> 00:55.900
let me join as your backup dancer.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.420
It doesn't matter if you say I'm selfish

00:58.420 --> 00:59.720
I don't care

00:59.720 --> 01:07.360
I'll shine on your darkness, so look carefully

01:07.360 --> 01:12.200
I'll make a new world

01:12.500 --> 01:13.800
Now follow me

Everyone looks at me

Everyone looks at me

01:22.840 --> 01:25.110
Me me me me

01:25.110 --> 01:26.420
Everyone looks at me

01:26.420 --> 01:28.850
Me me me me

01:40.300 --> 01:42.870
An apology isn't going to make it okay!

01:42.870 --> 01:44.970
The show is in two days.

01:44.970 --> 01:46.840
How can you be so reckless?

01:50.410 --> 01:51.710
Director Yoon!

01:51.710 --> 01:53.640
Don't be too down.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.979
Don't, Hyun-ji.

01:56.479 --> 01:57.850
Come on.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.880
We have our reasons.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.390
Reason? What reason?

02:03.390 --> 02:06.660
We'll make sure not to blame Mars and the agency...

02:06.660 --> 02:09.120
You think making a childish video will be

02:09.120 --> 02:10.660
explanation enough?

02:10.660 --> 02:11.360
What?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.830
Who...

02:13.560 --> 02:16.500
Who'd want to listen to your explanation?

02:16.930 --> 02:19.370
Go tell Kim Jenna.

02:19.370 --> 02:20.700
Cotton Candy

02:22.170 --> 02:24.940
will do the show as planned. Okay?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.079
Get out.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.990
Hey, Choi So-yeon!

02:39.520 --> 02:41.200
What are you playing at?

02:43.560 --> 02:44.430
You think a show is a joke?

02:44.430 --> 02:47.630
She must've practiced a lot. She was perfect.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.530
That's not what I'm talking about.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.570
That is what I'm talking about.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.280
She was so sincere, I couldn't turn her down.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.610
You didn't even wait a year

03:02.610 --> 03:05.010
before you left us after our album failed.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.150
I wondered how you could stay

03:08.150 --> 03:10.120
so long with a team totally ruined.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.750
Now I see.

03:12.990 --> 03:15.290
Sharing humiliation...

03:15.460 --> 03:17.290
What tear-jerking team work.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.990
But why did you fail?

03:19.860 --> 03:21.530
I'll talk to the choreography team.

03:21.530 --> 03:24.600
Get in sync before joining practice.

03:26.070 --> 03:27.540
If you do this right,

03:29.940 --> 03:33.010
I'll admit that your leaving was

03:33.310 --> 03:34.380
partially our fault.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.850
What if there's a problem?

03:45.190 --> 03:47.720
They already closed shop. Giving them a small job

03:47.720 --> 03:49.290
will be no problem.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.660
If they were known enough to be a problem,

03:51.660 --> 03:53.400
they wouldn't be called a failed idol group.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.950
When I think about how she left

03:54.950 --> 03:56.210
and almost ruined us,

03:56.230 --> 03:57.530
I still get mad.

04:14.350 --> 04:15.820
What is it this time?

04:15.820 --> 04:19.420
Jenna says she'll be a backup dancer with me!

04:20.360 --> 04:21.490
She chose

04:22.320 --> 04:23.990
not to give up on either of us.

04:24.790 --> 04:25.790
Instead,

04:26.660 --> 04:28.330
do you know what she gave up?

04:30.270 --> 04:30.830
The collaboration.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.440
You know what kind of opportunity that was.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.240
Both of you, stop.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.580
What are you doing?

04:49.150 --> 04:50.950
I can't let you do the show alone.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.890
You still going on that spiel?

04:59.830 --> 05:01.200
I quit.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.770
Take their song or not. Do whatever you want!

05:08.170 --> 05:09.740
If you quit now,

05:10.970 --> 05:13.940
you'll remain as the person KillA thinks you are.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.210
A waste of breath.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.050
I don't care what they think about me.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.660
You wanted to talk about allocating parts?

05:28.660 --> 05:29.660
Get ready.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
Elle.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.670
This was it? You acted so resolute!

05:40.040 --> 05:41.370
This is your limit.

05:41.370 --> 05:43.370
You'll live like this, then get finished off.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.440
You won't amount to anything.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.100
Don't worry about us.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.160
We're strong.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.800
You'll be dancing to KillA's song because of us.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.040
So how could we ignore that and sing our song?

06:18.770 --> 06:20.540
Let me do this just this once.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.640
Then I'll really stop.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.310
The path you want to take...

06:27.950 --> 06:29.420
I'll respect it.

06:30.650 --> 06:33.390
I'll admit that my stubbornness made it hard.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.690
I'll admit that we're different.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.590
But you know what, Elle?

06:40.460 --> 06:42.960
If you can't bear it,

06:43.770 --> 06:45.070
come back.

06:46.230 --> 06:47.400
It's okay.

07:20.740 --> 07:25.040
Part 8
Bloomed

07:27.680 --> 07:28.740
Let's begin.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.050
You know our range, right?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.750
I'm third octave C#, higher in a falsetto.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.120
Stella is third octave C.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.290
Chae-ah is...

07:41.760 --> 07:42.990
Are you listening to me?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.860
Chae-ah is D, Hyun-ji is E.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.070
I can ad-lib in the lower range.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.740
Hyun-ji can do a high-tone falsetto...

07:55.800 --> 07:57.710
You're not listening!

07:57.909 --> 07:58.610
Let's do it later.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.740
No. Now.

08:00.510 --> 08:01.840
Focus.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.080
Hyun-ji can rap in the middle range.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.020
Chae-ah can do a clean high-tone half falsetto.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.260
Stella can't go higher in falsetto than C.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.260
She can rap in the middle range.

08:15.490 --> 08:16.560
Okay.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.560
After I decide the key and parts,

08:18.560 --> 08:19.860
I'll record the guide.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.000
When can you finish the mastering?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.900
You know our schedule, right?

08:28.570 --> 08:29.440
How much

08:29.910 --> 08:31.910
more understanding must I be?

08:31.910 --> 08:32.840
I'm sure they have a reason.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.010
So?

08:34.010 --> 08:36.039
Why must I be understanding toward them?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.520
The collab is canceled?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.320
What is Director Yoon talking about?

08:49.260 --> 08:50.590
It was fun.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.060
Cotton Candy will be disappointed, too.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.430
It's not official.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.170
I'll find out what's going on.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.470
Kim Jenna

09:03.940 --> 09:05.110
Hello.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.480
- I...
- Kim Jenna!

09:12.480 --> 09:14.000
Talk with me first.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.090
Elle, Troy, backup dancer?

09:24.260 --> 09:26.590
Did I hear wrong?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.300
I'm sorry.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.300
But it's very important to us.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.570
Important?

09:33.770 --> 09:34.400
Kim Jenna...

09:34.400 --> 09:35.700
I know the show with Mars

09:36.500 --> 09:40.080
is an opportunity we'll never get again.

09:40.080 --> 09:40.780
But?

09:40.780 --> 09:42.610
A chance to right a past wrong

09:42.610 --> 09:44.250
will also never come again.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.650
It is

09:45.910 --> 09:48.020
a chance we can't let us pass by.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.720
You don't know anything about priorities.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.590
I'm sorry for causing confusion.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.620
You'll regret it.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.730
I made my choice, deciding not to regret it.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.800
There must be another way.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.300
No.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.570
I won't look for another way.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.100
You once said,

10:09.470 --> 10:10.470
you asked

10:10.710 --> 10:13.340
what you should define yourself as.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.480
Not "me" that exists to be seen.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.880
What is another "me?"

10:20.550 --> 10:22.230
Everything I do nowadays

10:22.380 --> 10:24.890
is like a struggling process to meet a new me.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.360
It's the same for me, for all of us.

10:27.990 --> 10:30.260
Not an idol singer trapped in a failed dream.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.130
What is another "me?"

10:34.630 --> 10:36.730
Is that priority right now?

10:36.930 --> 10:37.870
Yes.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.300
It is.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.670
Because it's right now, it's important.

10:41.670 --> 10:44.440
I have to know right now.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.180
Kim Jenna, whatever you think,

10:49.980 --> 10:51.950
this collab will carry on.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.420
Got that?

11:07.030 --> 11:08.760
Then I'll really stop.

11:10.730 --> 11:12.400
The path you want to take...

11:14.000 --> 11:15.440
I'll respect it.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.770
Let me do this just this once.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.650
She chose

11:26.410 --> 11:27.980
not to give up on either of us.

11:28.920 --> 11:29.950
Instead,

11:30.750 --> 11:32.420
do you know what she gave up?

11:37.830 --> 11:39.130
This is your limit.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.200
You'll live like this, then get finished off.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.160
You won't amount to anything.

12:07.860 --> 12:11.330
Everyone looks only at me

12:11.330 --> 12:14.800
I'm tired of their looks

12:14.800 --> 12:17.230
I won't live by your standards

12:17.230 --> 12:19.100
I like myself the way I am

12:19.100 --> 12:21.600
It doesn't matter if you say I'm selfish

12:21.600 --> 12:23.100
I don't care

12:23.100 --> 12:30.610
I'll shine on your darkness, so look carefully

12:30.610 --> 12:35.720
I'll make a new world

12:35.720 --> 12:37.150
Now follow me

12:37.150 --> 12:38.450
Everyone looks at me

12:38.450 --> 12:40.820
Me me me me

12:40.820 --> 12:42.220
Everyone looks at me

12:42.220 --> 12:44.560
Me me me me

12:44.560 --> 12:46.030
Everyone looks at me

12:46.030 --> 12:48.330
Me me me me

12:48.330 --> 12:49.800
Everyone looks at me

12:49.800 --> 12:52.370
Me me me me

12:52.370 --> 12:54.940
I won't be stuck in your frame

12:54.940 --> 12:56.800
My standard of happiness is me

12:56.800 --> 12:59.770
Follow me if you can

12:59.770 --> 13:02.440
I won't put my life on the line for love

13:02.440 --> 13:04.350
It's a waste of time

13:04.350 --> 13:07.350
Follow me if you want

13:07.350 --> 13:09.050
I'm different, baby

13:09.050 --> 13:10.920
See how different we are

13:10.920 --> 13:12.790
I have so much charm, daily

13:12.790 --> 13:15.690
Everyone is only looking at me again

13:15.690 --> 13:17.660
It's boring, everyone is being pretentious

13:17.660 --> 13:19.460
I want you to be different

13:19.460 --> 13:21.230
Show me your colors

13:21.230 --> 13:23.030
Get it, a confident you

13:23.030 --> 13:30.470
I'll shine on your darkness, so look carefully

13:30.470 --> 13:35.640
I'll make a new world

13:35.640 --> 13:37.150
Now follow me

13:37.150 --> 13:38.510
Everyone looks at me

13:38.510 --> 13:40.880
Me me me me

13:40.880 --> 13:42.180
Everyone looks at me

13:42.210 --> 13:44.220
Me me me me

15:03.970 --> 15:05.230
I hope they're still there.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.270
Hurry.

15:27.590 --> 15:28.860
Good work.

15:29.590 --> 15:30.660
You, too.

15:33.060 --> 15:34.260
Good job.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.630
Thank you.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.500
Hey!

15:47.840 --> 15:48.910
Elle...

15:50.550 --> 15:51.810
Have you been well?

15:53.850 --> 15:57.020
Elle, your wave was stiff in the verse.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
Also...

15:58.750 --> 16:01.590
You still didn't break your habit of doing this.

16:01.590 --> 16:04.690
How many times did I tell you to fix it?

16:04.690 --> 16:06.260
If you do this, it's not pretty.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.660
Do it like this. That way, it's pretty.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.460
I nagged at you so much...

16:10.460 --> 16:11.970
Let's go.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.100
Bye.

16:19.410 --> 16:20.810
I hope you're successful.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.880
And...

16:25.110 --> 16:26.810
Don't forget what I told you.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.550
Let's go.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.370
Don't skip your meals.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.260
Sleep well.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.770
You'll be okay.

17:25.369 --> 17:26.470
Still not here?

17:26.470 --> 17:27.440
Nope.

17:27.740 --> 17:28.510
Jeez.

17:28.510 --> 17:29.910
We have no time.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.680
Get in!

17:32.680 --> 17:33.280
Huh?

17:33.280 --> 17:34.750
Hurry up and get in.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.620
Let's go.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.730
Sir.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.060
Did you see the show?

17:51.500 --> 17:52.500
No.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.540
Then why were you here at the right time?

17:55.540 --> 17:56.570
I was passing by.

17:56.570 --> 17:57.340
Ha!

17:57.340 --> 17:58.240
You came because you were curious.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.140
I said I was passing by!

18:00.140 --> 18:02.110
Why are you yelling at me?

18:02.110 --> 18:03.140
I know you came because you were curious!

18:03.140 --> 18:04.610
I said I wasn't!

18:04.610 --> 18:06.350
Don't lie to me!

18:06.350 --> 18:07.390
I told you...

18:07.520 --> 18:09.180
Both of you, stop.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.450
I was going to compliment you. Why get angry?

18:12.450 --> 18:13.690
Am I a kid?

18:13.690 --> 18:15.960
Why would I want your compliment?

18:16.260 --> 18:17.990
Wow, it's like talking to a wall.

18:17.990 --> 18:19.360
Are you an American blockhead?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.290
What?

18:20.290 --> 18:21.900
American blockhead?

18:24.030 --> 18:25.700
Come on, come on, come on!

18:25.700 --> 18:26.970
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

18:26.970 --> 18:28.140
Run, run, run!

18:30.670 --> 18:31.670
Get ready quickly.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.580
- Get them ready.
- Okay.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.160
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.030
Fight on!

18:54.030 --> 18:54.900
Fight on!

18:55.660 --> 18:57.030
This reminds me of our debut.

18:57.030 --> 18:57.900
Yeah.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.830
I'm going to kill it in there.

19:00.970 --> 19:01.970
Fight on!

19:02.070 --> 19:03.640
Don't be nervous.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.470
Good luck!

19:04.470 --> 19:04.970
Break a leg!

19:04.970 --> 19:06.710
- Just like practice.
- Good luck!

19:13.510 --> 19:19.020
Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

19:19.020 --> 19:20.150
Cue!

19:47.580 --> 19:49.880
Why do you keep coming up with these ideas?

19:49.880 --> 19:52.520
This isn't much of an idea, you know.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.090
It wasn't a compliment.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.400
Calla will kill me.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.340
Can I tell them you insisted on doing this?

20:28.920 --> 20:31.520
2021 Mars's Share the Love Concert

20:34.430 --> 20:36.700
Hard to believe

20:36.700 --> 20:39.470
Your embrace is like warm sunshine

20:39.470 --> 20:41.600
I had been just looking at you

20:41.600 --> 20:43.870
Now we are

20:44.410 --> 20:46.540
How can we leave?

20:46.540 --> 20:49.510
You came into my arms gently

20:49.510 --> 20:51.710
It's like a dream I've been imagining every day

20:51.710 --> 20:54.280
You know I

20:54.780 --> 20:57.590
Up in the sky, anywhere you want to go

20:57.590 --> 21:00.450
Baby I'm ready to go with you

21:00.450 --> 21:01.320
(Hold me tight)

21:01.320 --> 21:02.590
Holding your hands

21:02.590 --> 21:04.930
I feel so right, alright

21:04.930 --> 21:07.290
With you smiling at me

21:07.290 --> 21:09.730
I want to stay at this moment

21:09.730 --> 21:15.040
Every day, every day, you shine anew

21:15.040 --> 21:18.810
Babe,

21:18.810 --> 21:21.640
I can't believe all this

21:21.640 --> 21:24.880
I am walking on the clouds

21:24.880 --> 21:28.850
Stay just as you are now

21:28.850 --> 21:32.250
Stand by my side

21:32.250 --> 21:33.820
Right here, Cloud-Nine

21:33.820 --> 21:38.200
I can take you higher

21:38.240 --> 21:39.260
Wow! So cool!

21:39.260 --> 21:43.630
To another cloud higher than the cloud you see there

21:43.630 --> 21:49.140
I can take you higher

21:49.140 --> 21:50.970
The ninth big cloud over there (Cloud-Nine)

21:50.970 --> 21:52.270
They're good.

21:53.310 --> 21:55.280
I wonder why they failed.

21:56.180 --> 21:57.340
Sir.

21:57.340 --> 21:59.410
Why do you keep saying no,

21:59.410 --> 22:00.680
and then let them do what they want?

22:00.680 --> 22:02.510
I don't know what you're thinking.

22:02.510 --> 22:04.150
Even for a minute and a second, be with me

22:04.150 --> 22:06.690
Met like destiny, You and I

22:06.690 --> 22:08.250
My empty heart is filling up with you

22:08.250 --> 22:09.780
I don't know either.

22:09.780 --> 22:11.090
Just with your smile

22:11.090 --> 22:12.560
"I can do this all day"

22:12.560 --> 22:13.560
Just for you

22:13.560 --> 22:14.650
Super power on my mind

22:14.650 --> 22:16.480
But I think this was a good decision.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.830
With you

22:18.830 --> 22:21.640
who came into my world

22:21.640 --> 22:24.870
I walk on the clouds

22:24.870 --> 22:28.740
Shine like that

22:28.740 --> 22:32.250
Please keep shining brightly

22:32.250 --> 22:33.750
Right here, this is Cloud-Nine

22:33.750 --> 22:39.150
I can take you higher

22:39.150 --> 22:43.660
To another cloud higher than the cloud you see there

22:43.660 --> 22:49.060
I can take you higher

22:49.060 --> 22:55.940
The ninth big cloud over there (Cloud-Nine)

22:55.940 --> 23:00.270
My eyes are only for you

23:01.010 --> 23:05.010
My everything exists for you

23:05.010 --> 23:06.080
Why

23:06.080 --> 23:08.480
Now that I know you

23:08.480 --> 23:12.320
After I got to know you (oh baby)

23:12.320 --> 23:13.720
You let me in your sky, High-

23:13.720 --> 23:19.090
I can take you higher

23:19.090 --> 23:23.660
To another cloud higher than the cloud you see there

23:23.660 --> 23:29.070
I can take you higher

23:29.070 --> 23:33.470
The ninth big cloud over there

23:33.470 --> 23:35.840
Cloud-Nine

24:00.030 --> 24:01.470
A jam-packed performance of Mars
and Cotton Candy at Starpeace

24:01.470 --> 24:03.170
Ji-han and Jenna, fatal duet with "Tonight"

24:03.170 --> 24:05.240
Ji-han x Jenna, sexy chemistry in duet

24:05.240 --> 24:06.910
Dazzling leap of obscure girl group of 5 years

24:06.910 --> 24:08.280
Who is the girl group who collaborated with Mars?

24:08.280 --> 24:10.380
Starpeace, interesting harmony
between top idols and failed idols

24:10.380 --> 24:12.480
Mars's charity concert, Cotton Candy's
collab will be released as live video

24:12.480 --> 24:14.650
Cotton Candy rediscovered.
Will they climb up the charts?

24:15.050 --> 24:16.320
I'm glad it's a failed idol group

24:16.320 --> 24:17.520
They killed it, my idol group is the best

24:17.520 --> 24:18.720
Cotton Candy is an old diamond in the rough

24:18.720 --> 24:19.720
I was gawking because their chemistry is so good

24:19.720 --> 24:20.620
Let's do a come back, Cotton Candy!

24:20.620 --> 24:21.660
I'm going to be a fan of Cotton Candy's

24:21.660 --> 24:23.560
Is it true they were active 5 years ago?
They're so good

24:22.590 --> 24:24.090
As previously announced,

24:24.090 --> 24:27.800
Mars and Cotton Candy's collab concert video

24:27.800 --> 24:30.830
was uploaded on Starpeace's official website.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.230
At first, Starpeace

24:32.230 --> 24:35.800
planned a collab with Mars and Cotton Candy

24:35.800 --> 24:38.540
but found a way to keep to the undisclosed rule

24:38.540 --> 24:41.080
of charity events while also supporting Cotton.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.180
They chose to produce a video of the collab.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.580
In the disclosed video, Cotton Candy

24:46.780 --> 24:48.550
presented a powerful performance

24:48.550 --> 24:50.050
and a solid foundation,

24:50.050 --> 24:52.390
attracting the fans' eyes.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.760
We didn't have this many articles when we debuted.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.390
Should I be happy?

25:00.390 --> 25:02.560
There are a lot of comments, too.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.430
"Here they go again."

25:05.000 --> 25:07.300
"Is it their skills to hitch a piggyback ride?"

25:09.240 --> 25:10.770
The mean comments are Calla, right?

25:11.710 --> 25:12.710
Jeez.

25:13.110 --> 25:16.910
Whatever. I'm glad to see the mean comments, too.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.150
Wait.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.180
We're looking for the 26 Candies
Viewed: 1 / Replies: 0

25:32.960 --> 25:34.900
No one's come to our website.

25:36.430 --> 25:37.830
Have they all immigrated?

25:37.830 --> 25:40.300
What are you doing here?

25:40.500 --> 25:41.700
- Who is it?
- What's going on?

25:43.500 --> 25:44.710
What the!

25:45.470 --> 25:46.970
Why are you here?

25:47.740 --> 25:49.420
He finished the song.

25:49.580 --> 25:50.580
Really?

25:52.150 --> 25:53.150
Yeah.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.520
I brought the guide.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.050
Come to the studio tomorrow.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.550
Let's practice per part.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.320
I also set up the recording schedule.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.460
You can email it to us.

26:06.460 --> 26:07.460
Why come yourself?

26:07.460 --> 26:09.000
Who'd be glad to see you?

26:11.100 --> 26:12.230
Sorry.

26:13.630 --> 26:15.040
What I did was wrong.

26:15.870 --> 26:16.940
I'll make it up to you.

26:17.470 --> 26:20.370
I'll do everything I can to make you No.1.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.280
How can you be so confident?

26:23.810 --> 26:25.750
We'll make ourselves No.1.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.510
How dare you jump on the bandwagon?

26:28.620 --> 26:29.820
I'm glad you're here.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.250
Come in.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.120
- Stella.
- Yeah!

26:33.120 --> 26:35.290
I'm glad you're here. Come on in.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.160
Come on! Did you eat?

26:37.160 --> 26:37.760
Haa!

26:37.760 --> 26:39.290
- Come in.
- Huh?

26:39.290 --> 26:40.390
What's this?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.960
Oh, no, you don't. No, no.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.030
I can't forgive you this easily.

26:43.030 --> 26:44.470
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

26:44.470 --> 26:46.000
No, we can't forgive him this easily.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.530
He came all the way here. You want him to go?

26:47.530 --> 26:48.140
Yeah.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.940
- How can you say that?
- You're glad to see him.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.270
- Don't.
- You're glad, too. You're smiling.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.070
Hurry up and come on in.

27:13.530 --> 27:14.860
The sound is awesome.

27:15.860 --> 27:16.930
Thanks.

27:24.610 --> 27:25.770
Actually...

27:27.010 --> 27:28.840
I kept a tab on you guys.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.610
News, social media,

27:34.410 --> 27:36.620
I watched Stella's show,

27:38.050 --> 27:39.950
I went to Hyun-ji's club,

27:39.950 --> 27:41.720
I even read Chae-ryeong's articles

27:41.820 --> 27:43.360
in case it mentioned Chae-ah.

27:44.160 --> 27:44.990
Hmph.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.330
Wow.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.470
You were stalking us.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.670
Seeing things not working out for you

27:56.670 --> 27:58.370
made me so happy

28:00.970 --> 28:02.640
but also frustrating.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.750
Then...

28:06.910 --> 28:09.320
One day, people started talking about you.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.390
That you said you'll become No.1 and disband.

28:12.390 --> 28:13.550
They laughed.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.890
I got so angry.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.430
"Don't laugh!"

28:21.060 --> 28:23.760
"I'm going to make them No.1!"

28:25.270 --> 28:26.800
I wanted to shout that.

28:30.690 --> 28:31.820
You're a fool.

28:38.980 --> 28:39.980
Huh?

28:43.020 --> 28:44.250
It bloomed.

28:44.690 --> 28:45.690
What?

28:46.690 --> 28:47.690
The flower.

28:49.590 --> 28:50.620
It bloomed.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.100
I thought it would shrivel up.

28:56.530 --> 28:57.800
It bloomed.

29:14.770 --> 29:15.850
Jenna

29:16.550 --> 29:18.950
became a backup dancer with Elle?

29:18.950 --> 29:21.720
Yeah. She's something, alright.

29:22.020 --> 29:25.030
I don't know how Elle ended up as a backup dancer.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.870
Is Troy

29:34.370 --> 29:36.370
continuing to work with Cotton Candy?

29:37.140 --> 29:37.870
I think so.

29:37.870 --> 29:38.970
Darn it!

29:49.880 --> 29:51.020
Why are you here?

29:52.290 --> 29:55.220
Stop visiting me, pretending to be affectionate.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.620
When are you going to lunch?

29:57.590 --> 29:58.490
Whoa.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.160
Are you an outcast?

30:00.330 --> 30:03.060
You came because no one will eat with you?

30:03.060 --> 30:04.670
Wow, old lady.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.930
I came, worried you'd collapse of loneliness.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.400
I won't eat with you.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.840
- Why not?
- Hey!

30:09.840 --> 30:11.610
Having lunch entails talking.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.810
How can I eat with you, having different values?

30:14.810 --> 30:16.380
We don't mesh!

30:19.150 --> 30:20.150
Oh!

30:20.480 --> 30:22.280
Call her.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.250
Then I'll go to lunch with you.

30:23.250 --> 30:24.320
Who?

30:25.890 --> 30:27.520
Kim Jenna?

30:27.720 --> 30:29.160
Why?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.860
She's an idol singer.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.330
I like idol singers.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.760
Aunt!

30:37.860 --> 30:40.130
The son of my brother's true love.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.070
If you hadn't interfered,

30:43.070 --> 30:46.610
I'd have a world-famous nephew by now.

30:46.610 --> 30:47.910
Are you Calla?

30:47.910 --> 30:48.910
Yes.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.340
Want to see my ID?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.580
I think I'll switch to Cotton Candy.

30:53.580 --> 30:54.950
I saw the show.

30:54.950 --> 30:57.990
They're really talented.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.320
You became

30:59.320 --> 31:03.320
messed up trying to survive among white people.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.630
But our family is warmhearted by nature.

31:05.960 --> 31:10.130
Don't wonder why you keep going soft.

31:10.130 --> 31:11.700
It's in your DNA.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.430
Why do you like Kim Jenna?

31:14.300 --> 31:16.200
Why do you like her?

31:17.800 --> 31:19.370
The same reason you do.

31:25.920 --> 31:26.920
Anyway.

31:27.310 --> 31:28.850
Thanks for lunch.

31:29.350 --> 31:30.320
Oh, right!

31:30.320 --> 31:33.050
I'll send something. Give it to them for me.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.450
What?

31:34.960 --> 31:35.960
Huh?

31:37.590 --> 31:39.760
Don't they have a 48-month installment plan?

31:40.890 --> 31:41.890
Hey.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.400
Don't act so poor.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.370
36 months is enough.

31:47.370 --> 31:48.740
Yeah, right.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.700
Huh? How about this one?

31:50.870 --> 31:52.070
Doesn't it look good with me?

31:52.070 --> 31:53.110
Oh!

31:53.270 --> 31:54.570
- It's great.
- Right?

31:54.570 --> 31:55.880
Is there a different color?

31:56.640 --> 31:57.410
There's a lot.

31:57.410 --> 31:58.450
Take a look at this.

31:59.150 --> 31:59.650
It's pretty.

31:59.650 --> 32:01.680
Wow, it's my kind of car.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.320
It's pretty.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.050
Huh?

32:07.050 --> 32:08.690
Strengthen immunity...

32:08.690 --> 32:10.490
Overcome fatigue...

32:11.060 --> 32:12.760
One teaspoon every morning and night...

32:12.990 --> 32:14.260
Accelerate blood circulation...

32:14.260 --> 32:15.700
Increase stamina?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
The person

32:17.160 --> 32:20.070
who gave Jenna medicine sent us this?

32:20.070 --> 32:20.500
Why?

32:20.500 --> 32:21.740
She's a fan of Cotton Candy.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.500
She used to be a fan of Mars.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.300
Is this

32:25.710 --> 32:27.970
"tribute" I've only heard about?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.610
I can't believe this!

32:31.340 --> 32:32.010
Oh, my gosh!

32:32.010 --> 32:32.910
Wait.

32:33.110 --> 32:34.180
Maybe...

32:34.450 --> 32:36.550
"This Is Wrong" is

32:36.550 --> 32:37.580
this person?

32:37.580 --> 32:39.150
Oh, my! Oh, my! You could be right!

32:39.150 --> 32:41.360
- Wow!
- Incredible!

32:42.090 --> 32:42.820
By the way,

32:42.820 --> 32:44.460
where is Kim Jenna?

32:44.930 --> 32:45.990
She's at Troy's studio.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.290
We set a recording date.

32:47.290 --> 32:48.260
Why?

32:48.730 --> 32:51.630
Are you surprised things are going smoothly?

32:51.630 --> 32:52.700
Or

32:52.700 --> 32:55.640
are you scared we might really become No.1?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.240
Hyun-ji.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
Sir.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.010
Get on board before it's too late.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.610
It's beneficial for you.

33:00.610 --> 33:04.580
Starpeace does it again without spending a penny!

33:04.580 --> 33:05.880
I can see the headlines.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.750
Isn't he already on board?

33:07.750 --> 33:08.980
He solved the collab problem.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.850
He still receives rent!

33:11.420 --> 33:13.520
We sent this month's rent. Did you see it?

33:13.890 --> 33:15.390
- Stella.
- Huh?

33:15.390 --> 33:17.490
You should go to work. To earn money for rent.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.060
Oh, you're right.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.130
Have a good time.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.100
Bye.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.030
- Bye, Stella.
- Fight on!

33:26.030 --> 33:26.770
Bye, Stella.

33:26.770 --> 33:28.540
Earn a lot of money!

33:30.100 --> 33:32.910
She teaches Pilates.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.410
To make the rent.

33:34.570 --> 33:35.280
What?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.040
You want 50% of that?

33:37.210 --> 33:39.350
How can such a huge company

33:39.350 --> 33:41.720
want to receive rent from us?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.320
It's not my money, it's the agency's.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.150
The agency's money is the CEO's money.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.370
Thank you.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.500
Hyun-ji doesn't mean anything.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.409
Thank you for letting us

34:41.310 --> 34:42.380
do the show.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.080
I only helped out because

34:44.280 --> 34:45.880
the promo article was released.

34:46.610 --> 34:48.719
Since it ended well, all is well.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.219
It's all thanks to you.

34:55.590 --> 34:56.659
That day, you insisted

34:56.659 --> 34:58.680
there was something more important

34:58.710 --> 35:00.220
than the collab.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.360
I didn't understand you.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.800
Until I saw the KillA performance.

35:06.370 --> 35:09.470
Seeing what you two accomplished on the stage,

35:10.470 --> 35:12.710
I understood why you did it.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.480
It was a better performance

35:17.340 --> 35:19.050
than the duet with Ji-han.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.150
I heard your new song is out.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.490
Do you need the agency's help?

35:29.890 --> 35:30.890
No.

35:31.490 --> 35:34.090
Making it on our own was the rule of this game.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.160
I promise fair play.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.770
Okay then.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.080
Hello.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.550
Reporter Mo.

35:59.650 --> 36:02.160
I told you on the phone.

36:02.690 --> 36:05.230
Cotton Candy has no value in writing an article.

36:05.890 --> 36:07.590
Come on.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.860
The value is created by the reporter's pen.

36:11.130 --> 36:13.770
If it's small, you can spice it up.

36:14.770 --> 36:15.870
Spice it up?

36:17.270 --> 36:21.210
I have enough flavoring people go crazy for.

36:21.270 --> 36:23.580
I'll also give you a Mars exclusive.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.090
That's not it.

36:34.090 --> 36:36.150
I'll check and get back to you.

36:36.660 --> 36:37.620
What do we do, Sir?

36:37.620 --> 36:39.690
Go, go, go, go, go.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.360
You done talking? You done going berserk?

36:42.360 --> 36:44.230
I said I don't know for sure!

36:44.230 --> 36:45.800
Take care of KillA on your side.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.130
We have to respond together.

36:47.130 --> 36:48.130
It turns out,

36:48.130 --> 36:51.940
Cotton Candy canceled the collab with Mars.

36:50.670 --> 36:53.770
[Exclusive] The true story behind
Mars and Cotton Candy's collab concert

36:51.940 --> 36:54.370
As the reason for canceling was revealed,

36:54.370 --> 36:56.140
controversy is flaring up.

36:56.540 --> 36:57.640
One industry official stated that

36:57.640 --> 37:00.410
to recruit popular producer Troy for their album,

37:00.410 --> 37:02.280
Cotton Candy promised

37:02.280 --> 37:05.390
to be a backup dancer in KillA's show,

37:05.490 --> 37:08.090
thereby canceling their collab concert

37:08.150 --> 37:09.560
with Mars.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.190
Troy, who didn't part with Cotton Candy

37:12.190 --> 37:13.330
on the best of circumstances,

37:13.330 --> 37:16.030
demanded Ell work as KillA's backup dancer for a day,

37:16.030 --> 37:19.000
and Cotton Candy consented.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.170
Issue & 24 News, Reporter Mo Ga-jin

37:19.170 --> 37:20.770
Mo Ga-jin, that bastard!

37:21.700 --> 37:24.740
We have to take care of this quickly.

37:32.580 --> 37:33.680
[Exclusive] The true story behind
Mars and Cotton Candy's collab concert

37:33.680 --> 37:35.180
The real reason Mars and Cotton Candy's
collab came out as a video

37:35.180 --> 37:36.820
Cotton Candy asked to cancel the collab,
the reason is too shocking

37:38.990 --> 37:40.420
Shocking truth of Cotton Candy's
reason for rejecting Mars' help

37:40.420 --> 37:41.860
Was Mars used by Cotton Candy?

37:43.590 --> 37:45.290
Shady deal between KillA,
Producer Troy and Cotton Candy

37:45.290 --> 37:46.960
KillA and Cotton Candy, inside facts

37:49.530 --> 37:51.500
Shocking! Cotton Candy scars Mars

37:51.500 --> 37:53.170
Decades-long ill-fated relationship between
KillA, Cotton Candy and Producer Troy

37:56.870 --> 37:57.900
What do we do?

38:00.210 --> 38:01.880
- I can't read anymore.
- Seriously...

38:01.880 --> 38:05.180
Why are there more problems?

38:13.350 --> 38:15.360
[Exclusive] The true story behind
Mars and Cotton Candy's collab concert

38:24.830 --> 38:26.100
Did you know?

38:29.900 --> 38:32.470
But you still agreed to upload the collab video?

38:33.840 --> 38:34.210
Yes.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.640
Hey, Seo Ji-han!

38:36.910 --> 38:38.680
Who do you think you are?

38:38.680 --> 38:40.580
How can you not think about our team?

38:42.650 --> 38:43.620
The article was exaggerated.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.020
That's not what's important!

38:45.020 --> 38:46.190
Can't you see Mars was made a fool?

38:46.190 --> 38:47.850
If a reporter says we're a fool,

38:48.660 --> 38:49.560
does that make us a fool?

38:49.560 --> 38:50.560
Hey!

38:50.720 --> 38:52.430
Stop it!

39:00.130 --> 39:02.700
You've been arguing more since Cotton Candy.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.770
I'm more worried about that.

39:06.410 --> 39:07.270
Starpeace

39:07.270 --> 39:09.940
ignored Calla's opinion of not wanting

39:09.210 --> 39:11.710
Cotton_Candy_OUT
Cotton_Candy_Disband

39:09.940 --> 39:12.180
the collab between Mars and Cotton Candy.

39:11.710 --> 39:13.010
We ask Starpeace to protect Mars

39:12.180 --> 39:16.720
In the end, Mars was manipulated by Cotton Candy.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.450
Cotton_Candy_Stop
Cotton_Candy_Disband

39:14.450 --> 39:15.980
Cotton_Candy_OUT
Cotton_Candy_Stop

39:15.980 --> 39:17.480
Cotton_Candy_Stop
Cotton_Candy_Disband

39:17.180 --> 39:18.990
We ask Starpeace to stop

39:18.990 --> 39:20.990
Cotton Candy from getting involved

39:20.990 --> 39:22.220
with Mars!

39:22.220 --> 39:24.590
Please protect our Mars!

39:24.590 --> 39:26.390
Opportunists Cotton Candy!

39:26.390 --> 39:28.160
Don't let them get involved with Mars!

39:28.160 --> 39:29.860
Stop the tie-in sales!

39:29.860 --> 39:31.700
Stop mooching off of them!

39:31.700 --> 39:33.400
Director Yoon! Come out!

39:33.400 --> 39:35.070
Director Yoon! Come out!

39:35.070 --> 39:39.340
Director Yoon! Director Yoon! Director Yoon!

39:39.340 --> 39:42.110
I didn't make them do it. Why call me out?

39:42.240 --> 39:44.340
I didn't make them do it. Why...

39:44.810 --> 39:47.250
I didn't make them do it!

39:47.250 --> 39:48.980
Since Mars and Calla are involved,

39:48.980 --> 39:50.780
most news agencies accepted the story.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.020
The problem is the abusive articles.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.020
They'll vomit articles all day long,

39:55.020 --> 39:55.960
continuing with the controversy.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.490
They'll expose the past all week long

39:57.490 --> 39:58.860
and make click-bait titles.

39:58.860 --> 40:00.480
The content will be the same

40:00.480 --> 40:01.330
since they copy each other.

40:01.330 --> 40:02.900
The Calla website has also exploded.

40:03.130 --> 40:04.900
They're all enraged.

40:05.470 --> 40:08.670
How did that bastard know what I didn't know?

40:11.140 --> 40:13.240
Who's the snitch? Huh?

40:13.240 --> 40:13.870
The problem is

40:13.870 --> 40:15.940
Cotton Candy, Troy and KillA are involved,

40:15.940 --> 40:17.310
so response isn't easy.

40:17.310 --> 40:19.280
If we make a wrong move,

40:19.280 --> 40:20.080
it may lead to a fight between agencies.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.950
First, make sure there's no damage to Mars.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.480
Ass. Manager Park grasp Cotton Candy's situation.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.350
Yes, Sir.

40:24.350 --> 40:25.720
Get me an appointment with KillA.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.590
I knew they'd cause trouble!

40:27.720 --> 40:28.550
Do you get it now?

40:28.550 --> 40:29.560
No, I don't.

40:39.030 --> 40:40.530
I'm sorry, Sir.

40:41.000 --> 40:41.740
Mars...

40:41.740 --> 40:43.070
Mars is okay.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.210
Then why are you here?

40:58.520 --> 40:59.490
Don't you know things will get worse

40:59.490 --> 41:01.250
if you worry about Cotton Candy?

41:03.120 --> 41:05.120
I came because I heard our choreography changed.

41:05.790 --> 41:07.360
Why are you here, Kim Jenna?

41:07.460 --> 41:08.090
What?

41:08.090 --> 41:09.300
Don't do anything.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.600
The agency will handle it.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.600
Oh, and...

41:11.970 --> 41:13.430
Let me meet Troy.

41:17.740 --> 41:18.840
Kang Yu-ri.

41:19.610 --> 41:22.480
Issues like these are a problem.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.680
I'm sorry.

41:24.680 --> 41:27.540
Didn't you say you broke up with that team?

41:28.150 --> 41:29.320
The more you're known as Elle,

41:29.320 --> 41:32.290
the less value you have to invest in.

41:34.290 --> 41:35.250
I clearly told you

41:35.250 --> 41:38.490
I only touch what I can make the best.

41:39.660 --> 41:40.830
What about you?

41:42.130 --> 41:43.660
Take some time off to think

41:44.330 --> 41:47.100
if you have the right to be the best.

41:48.800 --> 41:49.900
Sir!

42:04.250 --> 42:05.520
This is Cha Jae-hyuk.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.620
Who thinks

42:37.620 --> 42:39.490
they're the biggest victim here?

42:41.960 --> 42:44.920
It's a fact my girls were used in the fight

42:44.920 --> 42:46.090
between Cotton Candy and Troy?

42:46.290 --> 42:49.500
I admit our group and Elle have bad feelings.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.560
But that's it.

42:52.630 --> 42:54.700
If they hadn't started it,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.040
we wouldn't have done anything.

42:59.370 --> 43:00.510
That's right.

43:00.770 --> 43:01.640
Then

43:01.910 --> 43:03.410
who's the ultimate assailant?

43:04.810 --> 43:05.880
Me.

43:07.950 --> 43:09.480
So-yeon is right.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.450
I started this to torment Elle.

43:14.190 --> 43:16.020
I'm sorry I caused trouble for Mars.

43:19.190 --> 43:20.990
Then let's resolve it with Troy.

43:20.990 --> 43:22.030
Sir!

43:22.030 --> 43:24.030
I started it, so I'll end it.

43:27.100 --> 43:29.670
Sir, this isn't just Troy's fault.

43:31.070 --> 43:33.670
Shoot the human documentary later.

43:34.110 --> 43:36.510
So what do we have to do now?

43:47.090 --> 43:48.120
Sir.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.220
I can't let Troy take the blame himself.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.190
CEO Cha is right.

43:53.690 --> 43:55.430
I'm the one with the least to lose.

43:55.430 --> 43:56.600
I'm not a celebrity.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.430
Defaming my image is nothing to me.

43:59.070 --> 44:01.170
Troy is our album's producer.

44:01.170 --> 44:03.000
If Troy is hit, it won't be good for our album.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.340
And if you all come forth with a conscience?

44:06.140 --> 44:08.780
Will that help your album? Huh?

44:09.180 --> 44:11.610
This will end quickly if we make it simple.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.280
The person to blame is one.

44:14.450 --> 44:15.820
The target is also one.

44:17.180 --> 44:19.650
The rest are all victims. Got it?

44:22.660 --> 44:25.060
Play your roles properly.

44:26.860 --> 44:27.990
Sir!

44:32.770 --> 44:34.070
We're going to record.

44:41.840 --> 44:42.980
Sir!

44:44.440 --> 44:46.410
You know why we did that.

44:46.680 --> 44:49.720
This is just like 5 years ago.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.650
If we drive out Troy again...

44:50.650 --> 44:52.690
It's a totally different situation now.

44:53.150 --> 44:54.790
No need to explain everything.

44:54.790 --> 44:57.390
You said I looked good in the KillA performance!

44:57.560 --> 44:58.660
That time,

44:59.030 --> 45:01.190
your recklessness was right.

45:01.860 --> 45:03.460
This time, it's not.

45:04.130 --> 45:06.330
That time, it was a way to end things.

45:06.330 --> 45:08.200
This time, it will become a trigger.

45:14.770 --> 45:17.140
It'll be the beginning of dragging everyone

45:17.840 --> 45:19.710
into a quicksand you won't be able to handle.

45:20.410 --> 45:21.450
So...

45:22.180 --> 45:24.250
Just stay still until I give you a sign.

45:24.250 --> 45:25.380
A sign?

45:26.120 --> 45:27.290
Kim Jenna.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.290
Do you still not get it?

45:32.460 --> 45:33.790
A broken branch

45:35.260 --> 45:37.530
can help you cross the river.

45:41.270 --> 45:43.070
I don't want to say this but...

45:44.270 --> 45:45.770
Trust me for once.

45:49.980 --> 45:50.810
I mean...

45:51.410 --> 45:53.210
Trust my instincts.

46:09.130 --> 46:11.430
Troy opens up, "It's all my fault.
I was being petty. I regret it."

46:11.430 --> 46:13.800
KillA So-yeon, "I just did my old friend Elle
a favor. I'm taken aback by the response."

46:17.200 --> 46:19.770
Cotton Candy Elle, "I asked KillA for a favor
for Cotton's album. KillA didn't know the details."

46:21.670 --> 46:24.110
Cotton Candy Jenna, "It wasn't something Elle
should carry alone. Friends face the rain together."

46:27.010 --> 46:28.410
They wrote favorably.

46:28.410 --> 46:29.380
Hello, Sir.

46:29.380 --> 46:29.980
Let's begin.

46:29.980 --> 46:30.380
Yes, Sir.

46:30.380 --> 46:33.150
Most of the articles say it's Troy's fault.

46:32.150 --> 46:34.350
Famous producer Troy left Starpeace
because of debate over plagiarism

46:33.150 --> 46:34.420
Famous producer Troy left Starpeace

46:34.350 --> 46:35.250
A tragedy caused by a grudge kept for 5 years?

46:34.420 --> 46:36.990
because of debate over plagiarism.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.250
Troy gets criticized by Mars and KillA fans

46:36.990 --> 46:39.190
A tragedy caused by a 5-year-old grudge?

46:39.190 --> 46:41.590
Criticism toward the assailant Troy.

46:41.030 --> 46:41.630
Troy gets criticized by Mars and KillA fans

46:41.590 --> 46:42.930
Troy's belated revenge!

46:41.630 --> 46:42.430
Troy used their desperation, it must be criticized
Criticism toward the assailant Troy

46:42.430 --> 46:43.630
Troy's belated revenge, innocent Mars
and KillA suffer damage

46:42.930 --> 46:45.100
Innocent Mars and KillA suffer damage as well.

46:45.100 --> 46:47.960
The tables have turned favorably toward us.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
Sir!

46:49.940 --> 46:52.040
I got Jenna an interview with News Journal J.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.640
The time, place and broadcasting time slot

46:53.640 --> 46:54.770
have all been set.

46:56.340 --> 46:58.480
Kim Jenna. I'm giving you the sign now.

46:58.480 --> 46:59.750
Are you ready?

47:00.580 --> 47:03.720
We have Jenna, who's at the center of the issue.

47:04.850 --> 47:06.920
How do you feel?

47:07.550 --> 47:08.550
I think

47:08.550 --> 47:11.220
Troy isn't the only one to blame.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.360
At that time,

47:12.830 --> 47:13.890
we were

47:14.330 --> 47:15.630
also wrong.

47:17.360 --> 47:20.400
We only thought of pushing Troy out.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.480
We should've shown him

47:22.870 --> 47:25.200
that we were friends in a different way...

47:25.440 --> 47:26.310
I really

47:27.170 --> 47:28.840
regret what I did.

47:29.480 --> 47:30.480
So...

47:30.840 --> 47:32.010
this time,

47:32.280 --> 47:34.080
I wanted to show Troy

47:34.080 --> 47:35.550
the choice we made.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.250
I thought that was a way

47:38.480 --> 47:41.250
we could apologize to Troy for our past.

47:42.460 --> 47:45.390
How did you think to do that?

47:45.990 --> 47:48.690
I realized that Troy didn't really

47:49.300 --> 47:51.530
want to hurt us.

47:52.630 --> 47:55.230
Because I felt Troy's pain

47:55.230 --> 47:57.200
as he pushed us away.

47:58.570 --> 47:59.510
So...

48:00.110 --> 48:02.940
I thought we had to apologize properly.

48:04.010 --> 48:04.780
No,

48:05.180 --> 48:07.410
we had to go back to the past.

48:08.180 --> 48:11.480
Because we knew each other's dreams,

48:11.480 --> 48:13.850
and we had rooted for each other.

48:14.350 --> 48:15.990
When you mention dream,

48:15.990 --> 48:18.590
do you mean becoming a successful idol singer?

48:18.590 --> 48:19.430
No.

48:20.130 --> 48:22.030
It's Troy writing songs

48:22.500 --> 48:24.160
and us singing them.

48:24.330 --> 48:26.070
It was a simple dream...

48:27.400 --> 48:29.780
It couldn't have been easy giving up

48:29.800 --> 48:31.800
on the collab with Mars, right?

48:32.510 --> 48:33.370
Right.

48:34.310 --> 48:35.440
It was

48:35.680 --> 48:37.240
a great opportunity for us.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.010
Wow.

48:38.010 --> 48:40.150
How can she be so calm?

48:40.450 --> 48:41.310
Sir.

48:41.310 --> 48:43.380
Shouldn't we make Jenna

48:43.380 --> 48:45.020
become an actress instead of an idol singer?

48:45.150 --> 48:46.490
She's doing great.

48:46.490 --> 48:49.220
We took the path we thought was right.

48:50.060 --> 48:51.990
But we didn't know we'd unintentionally hurt

48:51.990 --> 48:53.830
innocent people in the process.

48:54.860 --> 48:58.360
I'm truly sorry toward Mars and Calla.

48:59.770 --> 49:04.000
I also apologize to KillA and their fans.

49:05.300 --> 49:06.670
I'm sincerely sorry.

49:08.240 --> 49:10.310
Thank you for being here, Jenna.

49:10.310 --> 49:11.410
Thank you.

49:12.510 --> 49:13.780
It's very rare for News Journal J

49:13.780 --> 49:16.780
to handle an issue in the entertainment field...

49:19.120 --> 49:20.750
She's taking the bull by the horns.

49:21.820 --> 49:24.220
I don't know if it'll do good or bad.

49:24.220 --> 49:25.660
With that,

49:25.660 --> 49:27.030
I think our Calla

49:27.030 --> 49:29.660
will soften up, too.

49:30.100 --> 49:33.470
The response is changing on social media.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.170
But a dramatic turn won't be easy.

49:37.670 --> 49:39.810
They could think she's being pretentious.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.480
We can't know what wave the public will ride on.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.340
I understand how you feel now.

49:48.880 --> 49:49.750
Huh?

49:53.220 --> 49:54.120
Huh?

49:55.250 --> 49:58.360
Reporter Mo has written this...

49:59.730 --> 50:02.700
KillA, Cotton Candy, Troy.

50:03.260 --> 50:06.400
[Editorial: Through Reporter Mo's Eyes]
KillA-Cotton Candy-Troy, Their True Growth

50:07.300 --> 50:09.140
Their True Growth.

50:09.140 --> 50:11.040
Seeing the public opinion go differently from what

50:11.040 --> 50:13.740
I had intended in my article, I felt regret.

50:13.740 --> 50:15.710
He made the situation regrettable first.

50:16.110 --> 50:18.040
Reporters write facts.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.580
Facts don't always correspond to the truth.

50:20.780 --> 50:22.750
The truth often hides behind facts

50:22.750 --> 50:24.320
and only reveals itself to those with sharp eyes.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.390
Now, for the weak-sighted people,

50:26.390 --> 50:29.660
I will tell the true story behind the controversy.

50:29.990 --> 50:32.420
In today's Korea, countless children

50:32.420 --> 50:34.090
dream of becoming idol singers.

50:34.690 --> 50:38.930
At a young age, they choose to become trainees.

50:38.930 --> 50:42.670
They endure years of harsh training to debut.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.910
Anxious, not knowing when they'll be cut,

50:45.910 --> 50:47.440
they compete with friends

50:47.440 --> 50:49.540
and practice every day in uncertainty.

50:49.540 --> 50:51.610
Why is the story going in this direction, huh?

50:51.940 --> 50:52.980
7 years ago,

50:52.980 --> 50:54.950
KillA, Cotton Candy and Troy

50:54.950 --> 50:58.250
were one of many trainees dreaming of debuting.

50:58.250 --> 51:00.220
They were hurt by friends who rejected the hand

51:00.220 --> 51:02.660
they held out, teetering on a cliff

51:02.660 --> 51:04.960
so they probably didn't realize

51:04.960 --> 51:07.630
their choices and actions had consequences.

51:07.630 --> 51:08.890
Let's look again.

51:08.890 --> 51:10.160
Let's be honest.

51:11.060 --> 51:13.730
Isn't the way they're settling old debts

51:13.900 --> 51:15.100
amazing?

51:15.230 --> 51:17.570
In a way no school or book

51:17.970 --> 51:20.570
or adult taught them,

51:20.870 --> 51:22.170
they did it.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.180
Troy didn't

51:24.180 --> 51:27.180
have to participate in Cotton Candy's album.

51:27.180 --> 51:27.980
But

51:28.250 --> 51:29.280
he did.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.420
Elle had left Cotton Candy,

51:31.420 --> 51:33.450
so she didn't have to accept Troy's demand.

51:34.220 --> 51:35.650
But she did.

51:35.960 --> 51:40.460
Cotton Candy could've gone ahead with the collab.

51:40.460 --> 51:41.730
But Jenna

51:42.130 --> 51:45.060
didn't leave her friend in the dust.

51:45.160 --> 51:47.270
Neither did she give up on Troy

51:47.630 --> 51:49.070
who pushed them into a corner.

51:49.370 --> 51:50.700
What about KillA?

51:50.770 --> 51:53.170
They knew they'd get criticized,

51:53.540 --> 51:56.310
but they complied with Elle's request.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.710
Mars wanted to help their senior group's comeback.

51:59.710 --> 52:01.910
And Starpeace wanted to help as well.

52:02.080 --> 52:05.150
Let's admit that their choices and actions

52:07.550 --> 52:08.750
were something no one could do easily.

52:09.150 --> 52:12.790
They grew, using their mistake as a stepping stone.

52:13.260 --> 52:16.030
We've all been through something like that.

52:16.030 --> 52:19.200
I hope this incident will serve as a momentum

52:19.200 --> 52:21.170
for the development of a more mature

52:21.170 --> 52:23.240
fandom culture that generously forgives

52:23.240 --> 52:26.110
a one-time mistake.

52:26.640 --> 52:28.270
What's with Reporter Mo, huh?

52:28.270 --> 52:29.110
Schizophrenia?

52:29.110 --> 52:30.840
It's perfect timing.

52:31.140 --> 52:33.550
It came up right after Jenna's interview.

52:33.550 --> 52:35.150
It feels like driving the final wedge in.

52:35.150 --> 52:37.520
It's the one who wrote the first article,

52:37.520 --> 52:38.950
so it will have a lot of impact.

52:38.950 --> 52:40.820
Our lifeline is in this bastard...

52:43.220 --> 52:45.490
in this reporter's hands.

52:45.660 --> 52:47.560
How can this be? Huh?

52:47.730 --> 52:48.590
Huh?

52:48.760 --> 52:50.430
Whoa.

52:50.430 --> 52:53.600
Seems like the tables have turned.

52:54.300 --> 52:55.230
Take a look.

52:56.180 --> 52:58.670
Will Cotton Candy Jenna's sincerity get through?
Cotton Candy's sincere remorse

52:58.670 --> 53:00.980
Cotton Candy and Troy's conflict, a story everyone can relate to
Cotton Candy has failed but their friendship is successful

53:05.040 --> 53:07.940
Will Cotton Candy Jenna's sincerity get through?

53:07.940 --> 53:09.640
Cotton Candy's sincere remorse

53:17.960 --> 53:19.360
Cotton Candy and Troy's conflict,
a story everyone can relate to

53:19.360 --> 53:21.060
Cotton Candy has failed
but their friendship is successful

53:38.040 --> 53:39.440
Is the current idol producing system okay?

53:39.440 --> 53:40.940
Market of infinite competition
hidden behind smiles

53:40.940 --> 53:41.740
Pity toward Cotton Candy,
Troy and KillA's conflict

53:51.390 --> 53:53.390
Stop mean comments, new perspective
on Cotton Candy, Troy and KillA controversy

53:53.390 --> 53:54.630
Growing interest on Cotton Candy's
new album produced by Troy

53:59.030 --> 54:00.770
Cotton Candy will disband after
new album becomes No.1

54:00.770 --> 54:02.230
Belated interest in Cotton Candy,
increase in channel subscribers

54:04.900 --> 54:07.900
Good comes out of Cotton Candy controversy -
Increased interest in 1st album's title song

54:07.900 --> 54:10.900
Cotton Candy's 1st album "White Day"
belatedly rises in the charts

54:21.750 --> 54:24.750
Cotton Candy's 1st album "White Day"
climbs up the charts -> Becomes Rank 120

54:34.670 --> 54:36.340
You're so cool.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.080
Congratulations.

55:14.670 --> 55:17.110
It's all been solved.

55:17.340 --> 55:20.580
Cotton Candy's only album is climbing the charts.

55:21.410 --> 55:23.780
Cotton Candy's issue rate is...

55:23.780 --> 55:24.920
It's all thanks to you.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.150
Aw, shucks.

55:27.520 --> 55:31.290
Jenna's sincere interview did it all.

55:31.290 --> 55:33.090
Your risk management skills

55:33.090 --> 55:34.190
played a huge part, too.

55:34.190 --> 55:36.160
If you'd refused to write a follow-up column,

55:36.160 --> 55:37.760
the situation would've been very different.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.000
Anyway,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.770
when you came to me yourself,

55:41.770 --> 55:43.140
I was surprised.

55:43.140 --> 55:46.040
Didn't Cotton Candy discard Starpeace?

55:46.040 --> 55:48.940
But you set out actively to fix their problems.

55:48.940 --> 55:50.710
I thought it was strange.

55:51.880 --> 55:53.150
Oh!

55:53.150 --> 55:55.350
It's because Mars is involved.

55:56.150 --> 55:57.320
Right?

56:04.220 --> 56:05.590
What are you playing at?

56:05.590 --> 56:07.090
Yikes.

56:07.090 --> 56:08.590
I said spice it up, but you sort it out?

56:09.130 --> 56:10.360
Who's sorting it out?

56:10.360 --> 56:12.500
I'm spicing it up.

56:13.070 --> 56:14.230
You've never fished, huh?

56:14.230 --> 56:16.440
You don't catch fry.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.900
They're small and not tasty.

56:19.770 --> 56:22.810
Whatever. I need it now!

56:28.750 --> 56:29.880
Here? The hook?

56:29.880 --> 56:30.750
Yeah.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.890
Should we add something?

56:33.250 --> 56:35.490
Yeah, I want that to liven up.

56:35.490 --> 56:36.990
Okay.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.770
Come on in.

57:00.110 --> 57:01.230
You're crying?

57:03.020 --> 57:04.150
What about you?

57:05.320 --> 57:06.750
I'm not crying.

57:06.750 --> 57:09.050
It's just a recording.

57:10.690 --> 57:12.720
So much has happened

57:13.560 --> 57:15.630
that I can't believe we're actually here.

57:15.630 --> 57:17.460
Come on. We haven't even started.

57:17.700 --> 57:19.870
Stop overreacting. We have a long way to go.

57:20.070 --> 57:21.600
It would've been better

57:21.800 --> 57:22.940
if Elle were here.

57:29.340 --> 57:30.440
Let's begin.

58:06.750 --> 58:08.280
Cotton Candy is recording today.

58:08.810 --> 58:10.220
Did you listen to their song?

58:10.820 --> 58:11.480
No.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.620
How can I when it hasn't been recorded?

58:14.120 --> 58:17.090
You're close with her, so I thought she let you.

58:17.590 --> 58:19.760
You're the closest person to me.

58:20.590 --> 58:21.590
I know.

58:21.990 --> 58:23.730
I thought you had changed.

58:25.500 --> 58:27.070
Hey, stop being a workaholic.

58:28.030 --> 58:30.500
Look at the sky and ground for once.

58:30.500 --> 58:32.500
That's no fun.

58:33.710 --> 58:34.740
Ji-han.

58:34.740 --> 58:35.610
Huh?

58:35.810 --> 58:37.710
Do you really want Cotton Candy to be No.1?

58:38.180 --> 58:39.460
That'll be good.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.850
Even if we'll be active at the same time

58:43.120 --> 58:44.650
when their album comes out?

58:47.520 --> 58:49.250
We'll be competing against them.

58:49.990 --> 58:51.660
Do you still want them to be No.1?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.610
We recorded our song today.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.680
I haven't been inside a studio in a long time.

59:10.980 --> 59:12.660
I couldn't believe it.

59:13.510 --> 59:14.950
I was so nervous.

59:16.480 --> 59:17.780
I was such a klutz.

59:18.020 --> 59:20.690
I was more nervous than during our debut album.

59:21.490 --> 59:22.690
Our song

59:22.690 --> 59:23.960
is really good.

59:24.790 --> 59:27.060
Troy produced it so well.

59:27.390 --> 59:28.990
So when we recorded,

59:29.360 --> 59:31.700
it was so much fun. We were happy.

59:32.130 --> 59:34.100
I hope you can listen to it soon.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.210
Congratulations!

59:45.210 --> 59:46.550
I look forward to it.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.200
Make some time in your schedule.

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:08.670
Don't take it the wrong way.

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:11.040
It's not doing sexual favors.

1:00:11.300 --> 1:00:13.010
It's to introduce you.

1:00:13.310 --> 1:00:15.310
It will be good to know them.

1:00:15.310 --> 1:00:17.010
Just sing one song and leave.

1:00:21.810 --> 1:00:23.150
Where are you?

1:00:23.650 --> 1:00:24.880
Should I go pick you up?

1:00:24.580 --> 1:00:27.280
CEO Park Seong-jin

1:00:25.050 --> 1:00:27.380
The gentlemen don't like to be kept waiting.

1:00:28.220 --> 1:00:30.420
You wore the dress I bought you, right?

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:53.180
Oh!

1:00:54.710 --> 1:00:55.450
Give it.

1:00:55.450 --> 1:00:57.130
A promise is a promise.

1:01:02.350 --> 1:01:04.890
I don't want to let her go.

1:01:06.630 --> 1:01:07.990
She's so pretty.

1:01:08.390 --> 1:01:11.000
Was this over a decade ago?

1:01:12.730 --> 1:01:14.570
I'll bet against you any time.

1:01:14.570 --> 1:01:16.700
But next time, bet with something more useful.

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:18.740
Not drag.

1:01:18.940 --> 1:01:20.470
You bastard...

1:01:21.340 --> 1:01:22.970
I'll tell you off one day.

1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:27.010
Oh.

1:01:27.010 --> 1:01:28.110
Did I interrupt something...

1:01:28.110 --> 1:01:29.110
No.

1:01:32.350 --> 1:01:33.290
Oh!

1:01:35.390 --> 1:01:36.720
Better hold onto that woman.

1:01:42.530 --> 1:01:43.890
What is it?

1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:45.760
Oh.

1:01:50.940 --> 1:01:53.910
I didn't get a chance to thank you.

1:01:53.910 --> 1:01:55.410
That's hardly necessary.

1:01:55.710 --> 1:01:57.180
I heard you recorded your song.

1:01:57.510 --> 1:01:58.340
Yes.

1:01:58.540 --> 1:01:59.880
It's really good.

1:02:00.050 --> 1:02:01.410
I'm not interested.

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:04.150
Sir.

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:07.840
You said a broken branch

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:09.530
can help you cross the river.

1:02:11.220 --> 1:02:12.560
I'll remember that

1:02:13.190 --> 1:02:15.930
whenever I feel like giving up in the future.

1:02:20.170 --> 1:02:21.700
I'll be leaving now.

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:23.840
Goodbye.

1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:37.320
We'll be competing in good faith.

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:39.680
But our song

1:02:40.450 --> 1:02:42.120
is powerful. What will you do?

1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:43.020
Jeez.

1:02:43.420 --> 1:02:45.790
Our song and our team are powerful.

1:02:45.790 --> 1:02:46.790
What will you do?

1:02:48.530 --> 1:02:50.100
I'm so curious.

1:02:51.930 --> 1:02:53.270
Won't you let me listen to it?

1:02:53.430 --> 1:02:56.030
No. It's not even mastered yet.

1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:58.470
Also, you didn't let me listen to yours.

1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:00.510
That's

1:03:00.510 --> 1:03:02.570
because Bbiyong is crazy about confidentiality.

1:03:03.740 --> 1:03:05.140
Let's have a listen.

1:03:06.110 --> 1:03:07.110
No!

1:03:08.110 --> 1:03:10.880
Hey, if you need a lot of equipment,

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:12.350
you've already lost.

1:03:12.350 --> 1:03:14.250
It's being respectful to a masterpiece.

1:03:14.620 --> 1:03:15.990
You have to listen through this

1:03:16.490 --> 1:03:18.390
to clearly hear the base.

1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:20.290
Okay.

1:03:27.830 --> 1:03:29.270
If I let you listen to our song,

1:03:29.470 --> 1:03:30.870
you have to let me listen to yours.

1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:33.570
Ours hasn't even finished being mixed.

1:03:33.570 --> 1:03:35.710
This is so unfair.

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:38.980
This might sound a bit cringy,

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:40.280
but

1:03:41.410 --> 1:03:43.620
I think I'm in love with this song.

1:03:44.450 --> 1:03:46.080
Then I should be careful.

1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.990
We can't be in a love triangle.

1:04:17.780 --> 1:04:18.780
What is it?

1:04:19.450 --> 1:04:20.450
This...

1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:25.200
This is my song.

1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:26.960
What?

1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:41.840
We thank Park Sun-young
for her special appearance

1:04:55.050 --> 1:04:57.250
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:04:57.250 --> 1:04:58.990
Expel Cotton Candy

1:04:58.990 --> 1:05:00.560
and protect Mars!

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:02.330
Tell them it's not plagiarism and fight!

1:05:02.330 --> 1:05:03.500
You think that will work?

1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:04.700
We're up against Mars.

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:06.970
I will not take a step back on this matter.

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:08.170
What do you want me to do?

1:05:08.170 --> 1:05:10.240
Drag everyone into a mud fight?

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:10.900
Don't go.

1:05:10.900 --> 1:05:11.570
Stop.

1:05:11.570 --> 1:05:13.140
I'll make it happen!

1:05:13.140 --> 1:05:14.110
You liked that song.

1:05:14.110 --> 1:05:15.310
Can you give it up so easily?

1:05:15.310 --> 1:05:17.340
What if word goes around that

1:05:17.340 --> 1:05:19.040
Mars plagiarized? Why are you dawdling?

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:21.210
What do you mean you can't reach Ji-han?

1:05:21.210 --> 1:05:21.750
Let's do it.

1:05:21.750 --> 1:05:22.850
Let's release our song on the same

1:05:22.850 --> 1:05:25.180
day and time of Mars's unit's song.

1:05:25.180 --> 1:05:26.820
But the time...

1:05:26.820 --> 1:05:29.690
We lack time, but it's not impossible.
