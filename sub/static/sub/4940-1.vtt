<i>(Flynn Ryder narrates)
This is the story of how I died.</i>

00:58.822 --> 01:03.038
<i>Don't worry, this is actually
a very fun story. And the truth is, it isn't even mine.</i>

01:03.039 --> 01:06.587
<i>This is the story of a girl named,
Rapunzel.</i>

01:07.293 --> 01:10.038
<i>And it starts, with the sun.</i>

01:11.593 --> 01:16.509
<i>Now, once upon a time, a single
drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.</i>

01:16.510 --> 01:22.212
<i>And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.</i>

01:22.726 --> 01:26.545
<i>It had the ability to heal the sick,
and injured.</i>

01:27.645 --> 01:29.657
<i>Oh, you see that old woman,
over there?</i>

01:29.658 --> 01:31.563
<i>You might want to remember her.</i>

01:31.564 --> 01:33.356
<i>She's kind of important.</i>

01:34.222 --> 01:39.028
<i>Well, centuries pass and a hop
skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom.</i>

01:39.291 --> 01:42.389
<i>The kingdom was ruled by a beloved
King and Queen.</i>

01:43.606 --> 01:46.525
<i>And the Queen, well she was about
to have a baby,</i>

01:46.735 --> 01:49.007
<i>but she got sick,</i>

01:49.068 --> 01:50.805
<i>really, sick.</i>

01:50.806 --> 01:52.246
<i>She was running out of time.</i>

01:52.247 --> 01:54.745
<i>And that's when people usually start
to look for a miracle.</i>

01:54.746 --> 01:58.298
<i>Or in this case, a magic golden flower.</i>

01:58.869 --> 02:01.867
<i>Ahhh, I told you she'd
be important.</i>

02:01.869 --> 02:04.179
<i>You see instead of sharing the
suns gift,</i>

02:04.180 --> 02:07.257
<i>this woman, Mother Gothel,
hoarded its healing power</i>

02:07.258 --> 02:10.164
<i>and used it to keep herself
young for hundreds of years.</i>

02:10.166 --> 02:14.246
<i>And all she had to do,
was sing a special song.</i>

02:14.247 --> 02:22.214
<i>Mother Gothel: *Flower gleam and glow,
let your power shine*</i>

02:22.215 --> 02:30.519
<i>*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine*</i>

02:30.520 --> 02:35.221
<i>*What once was mine*</i>

02:35.222 --> 02:38.236
<i>Flynn: All right, you get the jist. She sings
to it, she turns young, creepy, right?</i>

02:49.464 --> 02:51.499
We've found it!

02:56.189 --> 03:00.609
<i>Flynn: The magic of the golden flower,
healed the queen.</i>

03:02.355 --> 03:05.507
<i>A healthy baby girl,
a princess was born.</i>

03:05.508 --> 03:07.608
<i>With beautiful golden hair.</i>

03:16.025 --> 03:17.246
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

03:17.248 --> 03:19.024
<i>That's Rapunzel.</i>

03:20.624 --> 03:26.583
<i>To celebrate her birth, the King and
Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.</i>

03:30.699 --> 03:34.360
<i>And for that one moment,
everything was perfect.</i>

03:37.159 --> 03:39.136
<i>And then that moment ended.</i>

03:40.049 --> 03:49.666
<i>Mother Gothel: *Flower, gleam and glow,
let your powers shine*</i>

03:50.505 --> 03:52.948
<i>*Make the clock re...*
HUH!</i>

03:58.874 --> 04:00.708
<i>(Baby cries)
Flynn: Gothel broke into the castle,</i>

04:00.709 --> 04:03.559
<i>stole the child, and just like that...gone.</i>

04:05.551 --> 04:09.163
<i>The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.</i>

04:09.168 --> 04:11.030
<i>For deep within the forest</i>

04:11.031 --> 04:12.567
<i>In a hidden tower.</i>

04:12.567 --> 04:14.484
<i>Gothel raised the child
as her own.</i>

04:14.485 --> 04:24.410
<i>*...bring what has been lost, bring back what
once was mine, what once was mine.*</i>

04:24.411 --> 04:26.447
<i>Flynn: Gothel had found her new magic flower.</i>

04:26.448 --> 04:29.790
<i>But this time she was determined
to keep it hidden.</i>

04:29.791 --> 04:32.606
Why can't I go outside?

04:32.607 --> 04:35.677
The outside world is a dangerous place.

04:35.678 --> 04:38.032
Filled with horrible, selfish people.

04:38.033 --> 04:44.043
-You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
-Yes, Mommy.

04:47.552 --> 04:50.377
<i>But the walls of that tower,
could not hide everything.</i>

04:55.534 --> 05:00.144
<i>Each year on her birthday, the King
and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.</i>

05:00.146 --> 05:05.925
<i>In hope that one day, their lost
Princess, would return.</i>

05:24.498 --> 05:25.795
HAH!

05:26.749 --> 05:31.879
Hmm, Well I guess Pascal's
not hiding out here.

05:34.452 --> 05:35.479
GOTCHA!

05:37.245 --> 05:39.693
That's twenty two for me.

05:39.694 --> 05:42.318
How about twenty three,
out of forty five?

05:43.207 --> 05:45.749
Okay, well, what do you want to do?

05:48.173 --> 05:50.565
Yeah, I don't think so.

05:50.863 --> 05:53.425
I like it in here and so do you.

05:55.157 --> 05:58.837
Oh, come on Pascal, it's
not so bad in there.

06:10.278 --> 06:11.680
*Sings "When will my life begin"*

06:11.681 --> 06:15.924
<i>*7a.m. the usual morning line-up*</i>

06:15.925 --> 06:19.142
<i>*Start on the chores I sweep
'til the floors all clean.*</i>

06:19.143 --> 06:23.999
<i>*Polish and wax, do laundry and
mop and shine up.*</i>

06:23.999 --> 06:28.888
<i>*Sweep again, and by then
it's like 7:15.*</i>

06:28.889 --> 06:33.207
<i>*So I'll read a book,
or maybe two or three.*</i>

06:33.208 --> 06:37.915
<i>*Ill add a few new paintings
to my gallery.*</i>

06:37.916 --> 06:42.331
<i>*I'll play guitar, and  knit, and cook
and basically.*</i>

06:42.332 --> 06:46.377
<i>*Just wonder when will my
life, begin.*</i>

06:55.889 --> 06:59.816
<i>*Then after lunch, it's puzzles,
and darts and baking.*</i>

06:59.817 --> 07:04.336
<i>*Papier-mâché, a bit of ballet,
and chess.*</i>

07:04.337 --> 07:08.550
<i>*Pottery, and ventriloquy, candle making.*</i>

07:08.551 --> 07:15.874
<i>*Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch.
Take a climb, sew a dress, and I'll re-read the books.*</i>

07:15.875 --> 07:21.531
<i>*If I have time to spare, I'll paint the wall
some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere.*</i>

07:21.531 --> 07:26.622
<i>*And then I'll brush, and brush, and brush,
and brush my hair.*</i>

07:26.622 --> 07:30.920
<i>*Stuck in the same place
I've always been.*</i>

07:30.921 --> 07:34.941
<i>*And I'll keep wondering, and wondering,
and wondering...*</i>

07:34.942 --> 07:40.199
<i>*Wondering, when will my life begin?*</i>

07:41.714 --> 07:49.062
<i>*Tomorrow night, the lights will appear.*</i>

07:49.063 --> 07:58.108
<i>*Just like they do on my birthday,
each year.*</i>

07:59.343 --> 08:08.454
<i>*What is it like, out there
where they glow?*</i>

08:08.455 --> 08:17.362
<i>*Now that I'm older. Mother
might just let me go.*</i>

08:41.076 --> 08:42.402
Wow!

08:42.404 --> 08:44.974
I could get used to a view like this.

08:44.975 --> 08:47.441
-Ryder, come on.
-Hold on.

08:48.252 --> 08:52.024
Yep, I'm used to it.
Guys I want a castle.

08:52.025 --> 08:55.606
We do this job, you could
buy your own castle.

09:06.832 --> 09:08.757
Oh, hay fever?

09:08.758 --> 09:09.827
Yeah.

09:11.514 --> 09:12.589
Huh?

09:13.551 --> 09:15.937
Wait, wait.
Hey, wait!

09:16.844 --> 09:19.210
Can't you picture me in a castle of
my own?

09:19.211 --> 09:20.295
'Cause I certainly can.

09:20.296 --> 09:22.828
Oh, the things we've seen and
it's only eight in the morning.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.484
Gentlemen, this is a very big day.

09:26.714 --> 09:30.860
This is it. This is
a very big day, Pascal.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.779
I'm finally going to do it.

09:33.780 --> 09:36.569
-I'm going to ask her.
-RAPUNZEL!

09:36.998 --> 09:39.034
Let down your hair.

09:40.352 --> 09:41.370
It's time.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.912
I know, I know. Come on, don't
let her see you.

09:47.736 --> 09:52.292
Rapunzel, I'm not getting any
younger down here.

09:52.370 --> 09:54.165
Coming, mother.

10:18.637 --> 10:21.355
Hi, welcome home, mother.

10:21.356 --> 10:26.108
Oh, Rapunzel. How you manage to do
that every single day,

10:26.109 --> 10:30.147
without fail, it looks absolutely
exhausting, darling.

10:30.148 --> 10:32.376
Oh, it's nothing.

10:32.377 --> 10:34.422
Then I don't know why it
takes so long.

10:35.963 --> 10:37.431
Oh, darling. I'm just teasing.

10:39.808 --> 10:45.454
All right...so, mother.
As you know tomorrow is a very big day.

10:45.455 --> 10:47.571
Rapunzel look in that mirror.
You know what I see?

10:47.572 --> 10:52.010
I see a strong, confident,
beautiful young lady.

10:52.634 --> 10:54.611
Oh look, you're here too.

10:55.472 --> 10:58.804
I'm just teasing, stop taking
everything so seriously.

10:59.147 --> 11:02.662
Okay, so mother. As I was saying, tomorrow...

11:02.663 --> 11:04.724
Rapunzel, mother's feeling a little run down.

11:04.725 --> 11:07.063
Would you sing for me, dear?

11:07.064 --> 11:09.737
-Then we'll talk.
-OH! Of course, mother.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.717
<i>*Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine,
Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine.*</i>

11:21.718 --> 11:25.580
<i>*Heal what has been hurt, Change the fate's design.
Save what has been lost, Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

11:25.720 --> 11:27.615
-Rapunzel!
-So, mother,

11:27.616 --> 11:30.768
Earlier I was saying that tomorrow was a
pretty big day, and you didn't really respond,

11:30.769 --> 11:33.003
So I'm just going to tell you.
It's my birthday!

11:33.004 --> 11:34.383
TADA!

11:34.384 --> 11:36.531
No, no, no can't be.

11:35.732 --> 11:38.980
I distinctly remember. Your
birthday was last year.

11:38.981 --> 11:42.341
That's the funny thing about birthdays.
They're kind of an annual thing.

11:44.186 --> 11:47.082
Mother, I'm turning eighteen.

11:47.083 --> 11:51.880
And I wanted to ask,
what I really want for this birthday.

11:51.881 --> 11:54.930
Actually what I want for
(Mumbles 'every birthday')...

11:54.931 --> 11:56.613
Rapunzel please, stop with the mumbling.

11:56.614 --> 11:58.650
You know how I feel about the mumbling.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.748
Blah, blah, blah,...blah.
It's very annoying.

12:00.749 --> 12:03.293
I'm just teasing, you're adorable
I love you so much, darling.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.083
Oh, I want to see the floating lights.

12:13.804 --> 12:15.737
-What?
-Oh,...

12:15.738 --> 12:19.406
Well I was hoping you would
take me to see the floating lights.

12:19.407 --> 12:22.669
Oh, you mean the stars.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.453
That's the thing

12:25.234 --> 12:28.818
I've charted stars and they're
always constant.

12:28.819 --> 12:32.770
But these, they appear every year
on my birthday, Mother.

12:32.771 --> 12:34.807
Only on my birthday.

12:34.808 --> 12:37.594
And I can't help but feel that they're,

12:37.795 --> 12:39.862
They're meant for me.

12:40.786 --> 12:44.592
I need see them, Mother.
And not just from my window.

12:44.593 --> 12:46.092
In person.

12:46.093 --> 12:48.972
I have to know what they are.

12:48.973 --> 12:51.214
You want to go outside?

12:51.215 --> 12:53.445
Oh, why Rapunzel.

12:53.553 --> 12:56.798
Look at you, as
fragile as a flower.

12:56.799 --> 13:00.662
<i>(Gothel Sings "Mother knows best")

-Rapunzel?
-Yes?

14:51.417 --> 14:55.522
Don't ever ask to
leave this tower, again.

14:55.523 --> 14:58.560
Yes, Mother.

14:58.561 --> 15:02.722
Ahh, I love you very much, dear.

15:02.723 --> 15:04.824
I love you more.

in a bit, my flower.

15:28.223 --> 15:29.819
I'll be here.

15:54.658 --> 15:59.487
No, no no. This is bad, this is
very, very bad, This is really bad.

16:00.925 --> 16:02.962
They just can't get my nose right.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.640
Who cares.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.182
Well it's easy for you to say.

16:06.183 --> 16:08.295
You guys look amazing.

16:22.859 --> 16:26.486
All right, okay. Give me a boost,
and I'll pull you up.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.311
Give us the satchel first.

16:29.312 --> 16:31.895
Wha..? I just...

16:31.896 --> 16:33.735
I can't believe, that after all
we've been through together,

16:33.736 --> 16:36.192
you don't trust me.

16:38.195 --> 16:39.386
Ouch.

16:47.236 --> 16:49.145
Now help us up, pretty boy.

Sorry, my hands are full.

What?

RYDER!

-Retrieve that satchel with any force.
-Yes, sir!

17:22.617 --> 17:24.395
We got him now, Maximus.

17:32.366 --> 17:33.495
Heeyah!

17:37.952 --> 17:40.436
Heeyah! Come flea-bag, forward.

17:42.817 --> 17:43.844
No.

17:43.846 --> 17:45.354
No, stop it.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.525
Stop it.

17:46.903 --> 17:48.101
Give it to me.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.498
HAH!

18:23.947 --> 18:25.956
-AHHHHH!
-WHINNEYY!

18:51.808 --> 18:52.835
Oh!

19:31.805 --> 19:33.890
Alone at last.

19:34.055 --> 19:35.073
(((CLANG!!!)))

20:35.401 --> 20:36.532
Huh?

20:36.532 --> 20:38.347
(((CLANG!!)))

20:58.992 --> 21:00.010
Aah!

21:09.522 --> 21:12.670
Okay, okay, I got a person
in my closet.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.846
I've got a person in my closet.

21:16.389 --> 21:20.321
I've got a person in my closet!

21:22.945 --> 21:25.604
To weak to handle myself
out there, huh Mother?

21:25.605 --> 21:30.067
Well, Tell that to my frying pan.
(((Clang!)))

21:51.711 --> 21:52.934
Hmmm.

22:10.358 --> 22:11.541
Rapunzel!

22:13.518 --> 22:15.452
Let down your hair.

22:16.105 --> 22:17.123
One moment, Mother.

22:17.124 --> 22:19.313
I have a big surprise.

22:19.315 --> 22:21.587
Uh, I do too.

22:21.588 --> 22:24.269
Oh, I bet my surprise is bigger.

22:24.270 --> 22:26.737
I seriously doubt it.

22:28.627 --> 22:32.673
I brought back parsnips. I'm going to make
hazel nut soup for dinner, your favorite.

22:32.674 --> 22:33.894
Surprise!

22:33.895 --> 22:36.583
Well mother, there's something
I want to tell you.

22:36.583 --> 22:39.268
Oh Rapunzel, you know I hate
leaving you after a fight.

22:39.269 --> 22:41.934
Especially when I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

22:41.935 --> 22:44.729
Okay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, earlier.

22:45.757 --> 22:48.116
I hope you're not still talking
about the stars.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.745
Floating lights, and yes
I'm leading up to that.

22:50.746 --> 22:53.049
Because I really thought
we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

22:53.050 --> 22:55.027
No Mother, I'm just saying,

22:55.028 --> 22:57.906
you think I'm not strong enough
to handle myself out there.

22:57.907 --> 23:01.379
Oh darling, I know you're not strong
enough to handle yourself out there.

23:01.381 --> 23:04.639
-But if you just...
-Rapunzel, we're done talking about this.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.899
-Trust me,...
-Rapunzel.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.288
-...I know what I'm
-Rapunzel.

23:07.289 --> 23:09.484
-Oh, come on.
-Enough with the lights, Rapunzel.

23:09.495 --> 23:14.026
You are not leaving this tower,
EVER!

23:19.643 --> 23:23.504
Oh, great. Now I'm the bad guy.

23:36.292 --> 23:39.454
All I was gonna say, mother
is that...

23:39.455 --> 23:42.758
I know what I want for my
birthday, now.

23:42.759 --> 23:44.503
And what is that?

23:45.054 --> 23:50.870
New paint. That paint made from
the white shells you once brought me.

23:50.871 --> 23:53.987
Well that is a very long trip,
Rapunzel.

23:53.988 --> 23:55.870
Almost three day's time.

23:56.092 --> 24:00.928
I just thought it was a
better idea than, uh, stars.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.787
You sure you'll be all right,
on your own?

24:07.789 --> 24:11.139
I know I'm safe, as long
as I'm here.

24:19.288 --> 24:21.834
I'll be back in three days time.

24:21.836 --> 24:25.143
I love you very much, dear.

24:25.151 --> 24:27.099
I love you more.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.645
I love you most.

24:51.081 --> 24:52.311
Okay.

25:08.165 --> 25:09.183
Hmm.

25:30.081 --> 25:30.881
AHHH!

25:37.328 --> 25:40.864
Is this...hair?

25:40.865 --> 25:44.481
Struggling...struggling is pointless.

25:44.546 --> 25:45.564
Huh?

25:47.643 --> 25:49.634
I know why you're here.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.358
And I'm not afraid of you.

25:52.649 --> 25:53.871
What?

26:02.896 --> 26:06.445
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

26:07.939 --> 26:09.262
Ah hah.

26:10.291 --> 26:13.963
Who are you, and how
did you find me?

26:16.911 --> 26:18.763
I know not who you are.

26:18.764 --> 26:20.928
Nor how I came to find you.

26:20.929 --> 26:22.869
But may I just say.

26:24.236 --> 26:26.107
Hi!

26:28.010 --> 26:29.753
How you doing?

26:29.754 --> 26:31.259
The name's Flynn Ryder.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.138
Flynn mumbles:
How's your day going, huh?

26:35.334 --> 26:40.029
Who else knows my location,
Flynn Ryder?

26:40.030 --> 26:41.577
-All right, Blondie.
-Rapunzel.

26:42.065 --> 26:43.725
Gesundheit, here's the deal.

26:43.726 --> 26:46.519
I was in a situation,
Gallivanting through the forest.

26:46.601 --> 26:48.671
I came across your tower and...

26:48.671 --> 26:52.034
Ho, oh no, where is my satchel?

26:52.035 --> 26:55.576
I've hidden it, somewhere you'll
never find it.

26:58.377 --> 27:00.160
It's in that pot, isn't it.

27:00.735 --> 27:01.855
(((Clang!!)))

27:04.662 --> 27:05.783
Huh?

27:06.033 --> 27:09.087
Ahh, will you stop that.

27:09.088 --> 27:11.818
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

27:13.032 --> 27:16.143
So, what do you want,
with my hair?

27:16.143 --> 27:17.381
-To cut it?
-What?

27:17.382 --> 27:19.041
-Sell it?
-No!

27:19.042 --> 27:21.960
Listen, the only thing I want
to do with your hair,

27:21.961 --> 27:24.740
is to get out of it.
Literally.

27:25.079 --> 27:28.216
Wait, you don't want my hair?

27:28.217 --> 27:30.193
Why on earth would
I want your hair?

27:30.194 --> 27:33.679
Look, I was being chased, I saw a
tower, I climbed it, end of story.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.695
You're, telling the truth?

27:35.697 --> 27:37.149
Yes.

27:37.150 --> 27:38.263
Hmmm.

27:49.185 --> 27:51.730
I know, I need someone
to take me.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.118
I think he's telling the truth, too.

27:54.119 --> 27:58.001
Doesn't have fangs,
but what choice do I have?

27:59.021 --> 28:04.187
Uh, okay Flynn Ryder,
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

28:04.188 --> 28:05.856
-Deal?
-Look this way.

28:06.378 --> 28:07.437
Oh...oomph!

28:07.438 --> 28:10.009
Do you know what these are?

28:10.010 --> 28:13.311
You mean the lantern thing
they do for the princess?

28:13.312 --> 28:15.189
Lanterns...

28:15.190 --> 28:17.330
I knew they weren't stars.

28:18.137 --> 28:22.812
Well, tomorrow evening
they will light the night sky,

28:22.813 --> 28:26.851
with these lanterns.
You will act as my guide,

28:26.852 --> 28:30.462
Take me to these lanterns,
and return me home safely.

28:30.463 --> 28:34.741
Then, and only then, will
I return your satchel to you.

28:34.742 --> 28:35.939
That is my deal.

28:36.082 --> 28:39.645
Yeah, no can do.

28:39.646 --> 28:43.491
Unfortunately, the kingdom and I
aren't exactly, simpatico,

28:43.492 --> 28:45.783
at the moment. So I
won't be taking you anywhere.

28:52.903 --> 28:55.991
Something brought you here,
Flynn Ryder.

28:55.992 --> 29:00.188
-Call it what you will, fate, destiny.
-A horse.

29:00.189 --> 29:02.792
So I have made the decision to
trust you.

29:02.793 --> 29:04.121
A horrible decision, really.

29:04.122 --> 29:06.497
But trust me, when I tell you this.

29:08.901 --> 29:12.602
You can tear this tower apart,
brick by brick.

29:12.603 --> 29:17.015
But without my help, you will
never find your precious satchel.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.988
Let me just get this straight.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.876
I take you to see the lanterns.

29:21.877 --> 29:23.176
Bring you back home,

29:23.177 --> 29:25.347
and you'll give me back my satchel?

29:25.349 --> 29:26.605
I promise.

29:28.408 --> 29:33.381
And when I promise something, I never
ever break that promise.

29:35.823 --> 29:37.222
EVER!

29:40.302 --> 29:43.049
All right, listen, I didn't want
to have to want to do this,

29:43.050 --> 29:44.641
but you leave me no choice.

29:45.275 --> 29:47.056
Here comes the 'smolder'.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.610
This is kind of an off day for me.

29:56.611 --> 29:58.398
This doesn't normally happen.

29:58.408 --> 30:00.986
Fine, I'll take you to see the lanterns.

30:00.988 --> 30:02.487
Really!

30:03.283 --> 30:05.899
-Ooops.
-You broke my 'smolder'.

30:10.712 --> 30:12.703
You coming, Blondie?

30:23.202 --> 30:26.915
<i>*Look at the world so close, and I'm
half way to it*</i>

30:28.203 --> 30:32.167
<i>*Look at it all, so big
do I even dare?*</i>

30:32.746 --> 30:37.097
<i>*Look at me, here at last
I just have to do it.*</i>

30:37.670 --> 30:40.121
Should I? No.

30:40.613 --> 30:41.886
Here I go.

30:44.272 --> 30:45.815
(Laughs)

30:46.910 --> 30:50.475
*Triumphant music*

31:12.421 --> 31:18.410
<i>(Rapunzel sings When will my life begin)
*Just smell the grass, the dirt.
Just like I dreamed they'd be.*</i>

31:19.828 --> 31:21.624
<i>*Just feel that summer breeze.*</i>

31:21.624 --> 31:24.830
<i>*The way it's calling me.*</i>

31:26.221 --> 31:32.810
<i>*For like the first time ever,
I'm completely free.*</i>

31:33.749 --> 31:38.740
<i>*I could go running, and racing,
and dancing...</i>

31:38.741 --> 31:41.619
<i>*and chasing, and leaping
and bounding.*</i>

31:41.620 --> 31:45.223
<i>*Hair flying, heart pounding

<i>*And finally feeling,*</i>

31:48.278 --> 31:58.641
<i>*That's when my life
begins.*</i>

32:02.181 --> 32:05.667
I can't believe I did this.

32:06.058 --> 32:10.694
I can't believe I did this.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS!

32:11.961 --> 32:13.950
Mother would be so furious.

32:14.494 --> 32:17.944
That's okay, what she doesn’t
know won't kill her, right?

32:17.949 --> 32:20.754
Oh my gosh, this would kill her.

32:20.755 --> 32:24.093
THIS IS SO FUN!

32:24.094 --> 32:27.737
I am a horrible daughter,
I'm going back.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.388
I am never going
baaaccckkk!

32:30.389 --> 32:34.380
I am a despicable human being.

32:34.381 --> 32:36.440
WAHHOOOOO!

32:36.441 --> 32:39.047
Best day, ever!

32:47.610 --> 32:50.674
You know, I can't help but notice,

32:50.675 --> 32:53.963
you seem a little at war
with yourself, here.

32:54.452 --> 32:57.415
-What?
-Now, I'm only picking up
bits and pieces,

32:57.416 --> 32:59.827
of course, over protective mother,
forbidden road trip.

32:59.828 --> 33:01.412
I mean, this is serious stuff.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.327
But let me ease your conscious.

33:03.328 --> 33:05.059
This is part of growing up.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.178
A little rebellion, a little adventure.

33:07.179 --> 33:09.116
That's good, healthy even.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.112
(Laughs) You think?

33:12.113 --> 33:15.091
I know. You're way over thinking
this, trust me.

33:15.092 --> 33:17.257
Does your mother deserve it?
No.

33:17.258 --> 33:19.758
Will this break her heart
and crush her soul?

33:19.759 --> 33:22.760
Of course.
But you just got to do it.

33:23.656 --> 33:25.166
Break her heart?

33:25.167 --> 33:28.364
-In half.
-Crush her soul?

33:28.366 --> 33:30.263
Like a grape.

33:30.264 --> 33:33.055
She would be heart broken,
you're right.

33:33.263 --> 33:36.966
I am, oh my, oh bother.

33:38.459 --> 33:40.565
All right, I can't believe I'm
saying this, but...

33:40.566 --> 33:42.212
I'm letting you out of the deal.

33:42.213 --> 33:44.040
-What?
-Flynn: That's right.

33:44.041 --> 33:46.634
Flynn: But don't thank me. Let's
just turn around,

33:46.635 --> 33:48.386
and get you home, here's
your pan and your frog.

33:48.387 --> 33:50.142
I get back my satchel.

33:50.143 --> 33:52.246
You get back a mother
daughter relationship

33:52.247 --> 33:56.392
based on mutual trust and viola!
We part ways as unlikely friends.

33:56.420 --> 34:00.897
-No, I am seeing those lanterns.
-Oh, come on!

34:00.898 --> 34:02.775
What is it going to take
to get my satchel back?

34:03.324 --> 34:04.851
I will use this.

34:08.119 --> 34:11.257
Is it, ruffians, thugs?
Have they come for me?

34:15.330 --> 34:18.188
Stay calm, it can probably smell fear.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.885
Oh, sorry.

34:21.150 --> 34:23.944
Guess I'm just a little bit, jumpy.

34:24.989 --> 34:28.880
Probably be best if we avoid
ruffians and thugs, though.

34:29.013 --> 34:32.333
(Laughs)
Yeah, that probably be best.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.317
Are you hungry?
I know a great place for lunch.

34:37.137 --> 34:39.663
-Where?
-Oh, don't you worry.

34:39.664 --> 34:41.181
You'll know it when you smell it.

35:17.150 --> 35:21.276
Oh, a Palace horse.

35:21.277 --> 35:23.465
Where's your rider?

35:24.507 --> 35:25.550
Rapunzel.

35:26.683 --> 35:27.905
RAPUNZEL!

35:35.925 --> 35:39.457
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

35:41.321 --> 35:42.918
Rapunzel?

36:02.520 --> 36:03.418
Rapunzel!

36:06.483 --> 36:08.170
RAPUNZEL!

36:52.587 --> 36:55.839
I know it's around here, somewhere.

36:56.598 --> 36:58.516
Ah, there it is.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.438
The Snuggly duckling.

37:00.439 --> 37:03.189
Don't worry, very quaint place,
perfect for you.

37:03.190 --> 37:06.594
Don't want you scaring, and giving
up on this whole endeavor now do we?

37:06.595 --> 37:09.996
-Well, I do like duckling.
-YAY!

37:11.220 --> 37:14.270
Garcon, your finest table, please.

37:14.274 --> 37:15.387
(Gasps)

37:20.800 --> 37:24.004
You smell that?
Take a deep breath through the nose.

37:24.716 --> 37:25.938
Really let that seep in.

37:25.990 --> 37:28.953
What are you getting?
Because to me, it's part man smell.

37:28.954 --> 37:30.836
and the other part is
really bad man smell.

37:30.837 --> 37:33.272
I don't know why, but overall,
it just smells like the color brown.

37:33.273 --> 37:34.290
Your thoughts?

37:34.800 --> 37:36.964
That's a lot of hair.

37:36.965 --> 37:39.921
She's growing it out, is that blood
on your moustache?

37:39.922 --> 37:42.517
Goldie, look at this, look at
all the blood on his moustache.

37:42.518 --> 37:44.978
Look sir, that's a lot of blood.

37:45.961 --> 37:47.838
Hey, you don't look so good, Blondie.

37:47.839 --> 37:50.214
Maybe we should get you home.
Call it a day.

37:50.214 --> 37:53.423
Probably be better off. This is a five
star joint after all.

37:53.424 --> 37:56.891
And if you can't handle this place, well
maybe you should be back in your tower.

37:56.893 --> 37:59.582
Is this you?

38:01.785 --> 38:04.575
No, no this is being mean.

38:04.576 --> 38:05.827
Oh, it's him all right.

38:05.828 --> 38:08.036
Gretel, go find some guards.

38:08.037 --> 38:12.210
That reward's going to
buy me a new hook.

38:12.211 --> 38:13.654
I can use the money.

38:13.655 --> 38:15.684
What about me?
I'm broke.

38:16.572 --> 38:19.608
-Boys, stop!
-We can work this out.

38:19.609 --> 38:21.708
Hey, leave him alone.

38:21.712 --> 38:26.109
-Gentlemen, please.
-Give me back my guide, ruffians.

38:26.169 --> 38:28.511
HOO, HAH, HOO, HOO!

38:33.983 --> 38:35.808
Not the nose, not the nose,
not the nose!

38:38.400 --> 38:39.788
Put him down!

38:43.000 --> 38:47.508
Okay, I don't know where I am,
and I need him to take me to see the lanterns,

38:47.509 --> 38:49.825
because I've been dreaming about
them my entire life.

38:50.238 --> 38:52.527
Find your humanity.

38:52.528 --> 38:54.630
Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?

39:06.794 --> 39:09.035
I, had a dream.

39:09.036 --> 39:10.132
Once.

39:18.919 --> 39:21.297
<i>(Song: I've got a dream)
*I'm malicious mean and scary.*</i>

39:21.298 --> 39:23.366
<i>*My sneer could curdle dairy.*</i>

39:23.367 --> 39:26.669
<i>*And violence-wise my hands
are not the cleanest.*</i>

39:26.670 --> 39:31.310
<i>*But despite my evil look,
and my temper and my hook.*</i>

39:31.639 --> 39:34.819
<i>*I've always yearned to
be a concert pianist.*</i>

39:34.820 --> 39:38.570
<i>*Can't cha see me on the stage
performing Mozart.*</i>

39:38.573 --> 39:42.203
<i>*Tickling the ivories,
'til they gleam.*</i>

39:42.204 --> 39:44.471
<i>*Yep, I'd rather be called deadly.*</i>

39:44.472 --> 39:47.473
<i>*For my killer show-tune medley.
Thank you.*</i>

39:47.474 --> 39:51.210
<i>*'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream.*</i>

39:51.211 --> 39:54.553
<i>*He's got a dream,
he's got a dream.*</i>

39:54.554 --> 39:58.060
<i>*See, I ain't as cruel and
vicious as I seem.*</i>

39:58.062 --> 40:00.694
<i>*Though I feel like breaking femurs.*</i>

40:00.695 --> 40:02.781
<i>*You can count me with the dreamers.*</i>

40:02.782 --> 40:05.421
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

40:08.011 --> 40:10.048
(Singing in distance)

40:11.085 --> 40:12.980
<i>*I've got scars and lumps and bruises.*</i>

40:12.981 --> 40:15.195
<i>*Plus something here that oozes.*</i>

40:15.196 --> 40:17.873
<i>*Let's not even mention
my complexion.*</i>

40:17.874 --> 40:20.025
<i>Big nose thug: *But despite my extra toes.*</i>

40:20.026 --> 40:21.931
<i>*And my goiter and my nose.*</i>

40:21.932 --> 40:25.034
<i>*I really want to make a love
connection.*</i>

40:25.035 --> 40:29.063
<i>*Can't you see me with a special
little lady.*</i>

40:29.064 --> 40:32.326
<i>*Rowing in a row boat,
down the stream.*</i>

40:32.327 --> 40:34.366
<i>*Though I'm one disgusting blighter.*</i>

40:34.367 --> 40:36.403
<i>*I'm a lover, not a fighter.*</i>

40:36.404 --> 40:39.457
<i>*'Cause way down deep
inside, I gotta dream.*</i>

40:39.458 --> 40:43.124
<i>*I gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*</i>

40:43.125 --> 40:46.601
<i>*And I know one day
will never reign supreme.*</i>

40:46.602 --> 40:48.789
<i>*Though my face leaves
people screaming.*</i>

40:48.790 --> 40:50.899
<i>*There's a child behind
it dreaming.*</i>

40:50.900 --> 40:53.611
<i>*Like everybody else,
I've gotta dream.*</i>

40:53.612 --> 40:57.188
<i>*Tor would like to quit
and be a florist.*</i>

40:57.189 --> 41:01.190
<i>*Gunther does interior design.*</i>

41:01.192 --> 41:05.102
<i>*Ulf is into mime,
Attila’s cupcakes are sublime.*</i>

41:05.103 --> 41:06.927
<i>*Bruiser knits, Killer sews.*</i>

41:06.928 --> 41:08.902
<i>*Fang does little puppet shows.*</i>

41:08.903 --> 41:14.430
<i>*And Vladimir collects
ceramic unicorns.*</i>

41:14.431 --> 41:16.964
What about you?

41:16.966 --> 41:19.299
-I'm sorry, me?
-What's your dream?

41:19.300 --> 41:22.664
No, no, no. Sorry boys,
I don't sing.

41:23.826 --> 41:25.697
<i>*I have dreams like you,
no really.*</i>

41:25.698 --> 41:27.284
<i>*Just much less, touchy-feely.*</i>

41:27.285 --> 41:30.196
<i>*They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny.*</i>

41:30.197 --> 41:34.338
<i>*On an island that I own,
tanned and rested and alone.*</i>

41:35.058 --> 41:38.238
<i>*Surrounded by enormous
piles of money.*</i>

41:38.525 --> 41:41.937
<i>*-I've got a dream...I've got a dream.
-(Thugs) She’s got a dream.*</i>

41:41.938 --> 41:45.452
<i>*I just want to see the floating
lanterns gleam.*</i>

41:45.453 --> 41:47.886
<i>*And with every passing hour.*</i>

41:47.887 --> 41:49.563
<i>*I'm so glad I left my tower.*</i>

41:49.564 --> 41:52.458
<i>*Like all you lovely folks,
I've got a dream.*</i>

41:52.459 --> 41:56.542
<i>*She's gotta dream, He's gotta dream.
They've gotta dream, we've gotta dream.*</i>

41:56.543 --> 42:04.549
<i>*So our differences ain't
really that extreme. We're one big team.*</i>

42:04.551 --> 42:08.411
<i>*Call us brutal, say sadistic
and grotesquely optimistic.</i>

42:08.413 --> 42:11.345
<i>*'Cause way down deep inside,
we've gotta dream.*</i>

42:11.346 --> 42:13.659
<i>*We gotta dream,
I gotta dream.*</i>

42:16.998 --> 42:20.978
<i>*Yes way down deep inside
I've got a...*</i>

42:20.979 --> 42:27.037
<i>*Dreeeeeeaaaaamm.*</i>

42:27.038 --> 42:28.640
Yeah!

42:30.340 --> 42:32.681
I found the guards.

42:35.216 --> 42:36.751
Where's Ryder,
where is he?

42:36.752 --> 42:38.909
I know he's in here somewhere.

42:38.911 --> 42:42.024
Find him, turn the place
upside down if you have to!

42:58.023 --> 43:00.817
Go, live your dream.

43:00.818 --> 43:02.162
I will.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.706
Your dream stinks,
I was talking to her.

43:06.906 --> 43:08.391
Thanks for everything.

43:12.168 --> 43:15.119
I believe this is the man
you're looking for.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.937
You got me.

43:17.779 --> 43:19.407
Sir, there's no sign of Ryder.

43:23.678 --> 43:24.933
Maximus.

43:32.275 --> 43:33.799
What's he doing?

43:43.565 --> 43:46.581
A passage, come on men,
let's go.

43:46.924 --> 43:49.634
Corman, make sure those
boys don't get away.

43:54.519 --> 43:55.573
Play it safe.

43:57.871 --> 43:59.296
We'll go get the crown.

44:07.087 --> 44:10.882
I gotta dream,
I got some dream.

44:11.249 --> 44:15.851
I..., ohhh, somebody get me a glass.

44:15.852 --> 44:20.082
Because I just found me a
tall drink of water.

44:20.083 --> 44:24.170
Oh stop it, you big lug.

44:24.171 --> 44:26.649
Where does that tunnel lead out?

44:26.650 --> 44:27.726
Knife!

44:30.145 --> 44:31.624
Well, that got us safe.

44:31.625 --> 44:34.964
Didn't know you had that in you
back there. That was pretty, impressive.

44:34.965 --> 44:37.307
I KNOW!

44:37.308 --> 44:40.083
I know...

44:42.565 --> 44:45.327
Sooo, Flynn.

44:45.328 --> 44:46.528
Where are you from?

44:46.529 --> 44:48.714
Whoa, whoa, sorry Blondie,
I don't do back story.

44:48.715 --> 44:51.611
However I am becoming very
interested in yours.

44:51.612 --> 44:54.087
Now I...I know I'm not suppose
to mention the hair.

44:54.088 --> 44:55.901
-Nope.
-Or, the Mother.

44:55.902 --> 44:58.745
-Uh, uh.
-Frankly I'm to scared to
ask about the frog.

44:58.746 --> 45:00.102
-Chameleon.
-Nuance.

45:00.103 --> 45:04.056
Here's my question though, if you want
to see the lanterns so badly,

45:04.057 --> 45:06.414
why haven't you gone before?

45:06.780 --> 45:10.277
Uhh, hey, well...

45:14.475 --> 45:16.787
Uh, Flynn...

45:17.421 --> 45:18.675
Flynn!

45:21.005 --> 45:22.632
Run,
RUN!

45:40.976 --> 45:42.171
Who's that?

45:42.172 --> 45:43.375
They don't like me.

45:43.380 --> 45:45.804
-Who's that?
-They don't like me either.

45:46.523 --> 45:49.107
-Who's that?
-Lets just assume for the moment,

45:49.107 --> 45:50.624
that everyone here doesn't like me.

45:50.634 --> 45:52.124
Here.

46:01.265 --> 46:03.393
I've waited a long time for this.

46:12.647 --> 46:16.243
Oh mama, I have got to get me
one of these.

46:16.981 --> 46:18.000
HAH!

46:24.446 --> 46:29.207
You should know that this is
the strangest thing I've ever done.

46:33.868 --> 46:35.643
How 'bout two out of three?

46:36.777 --> 46:38.026
Flynn!

46:42.187 --> 46:44.427
Flynn, look out.

46:44.455 --> 46:46.765
-Whoa, WHOAAA!
-Hold on.

46:49.705 --> 46:52.311
You should see your faces.
Because you look...

46:52.779 --> 46:54.000
Ridiculous

47:01.341 --> 47:02.572
Come on, Blondie.

47:02.746 --> 47:03.866
Jump.

48:32.694 --> 48:36.452
It's no use,
I can't see anything.

48:41.317 --> 48:43.167
Hey, there's no point.

48:43.168 --> 48:45.011
It's pitch black down there.

48:53.131 --> 48:54.240
This is all my fault.

48:56.321 --> 48:59.027
She was right, I never
should have done this.

49:03.499 --> 49:04.837
I'm so...

49:05.721 --> 49:08.128
I'm so sorry, Flynn.

49:15.436 --> 49:17.346
Eugene.

49:18.370 --> 49:19.669
What?

49:20.081 --> 49:22.500
My real name is,
Eugene Fitzherbert.

49:24.272 --> 49:26.075
So you might as well know.

49:28.988 --> 49:32.532
I have magic hair that glows
when I sing.

49:32.533 --> 49:33.593
What?

49:35.779 --> 49:39.896
I have magic hair,
that glows when I sing.

49:40.973 --> 49:44.249
<i>*Flower gleam and glow.
Let your power shine.*</i>

50:33.851 --> 50:35.413
We made it.

50:36.007 --> 50:37.277
Her hair glows.

50:37.278 --> 50:40.002
We're alive.
I'm alive!

50:40.003 --> 50:42.834
I didn't see that coming.
You're hair actually glows.

50:42.835 --> 50:44.724
-Eugene...
-Why does her hair glow?

50:44.725 --> 50:46.043
-Eugene!
-What?

50:47.183 --> 50:49.874
It doesn't just glow.

50:52.302 --> 50:53.934
Why is he smiling at me?

51:18.407 --> 51:19.629
I'll kill him.

51:19.630 --> 51:21.358
I'll kill that, Ryder.

51:22.732 --> 51:24.851
We'll cut him off at the kingdom.

51:24.852 --> 51:27.079
And get back the crown, come on.

51:28.538 --> 51:29.668
Boys.

51:30.963 --> 51:35.750
Perhaps you want to stop acting
like wild dogs chasing their tails,

51:35.751 --> 51:37.857
and think for a moment.

51:39.928 --> 51:42.258
Oh, please there's no
need for that.

51:47.711 --> 51:51.540
Well if that's all you desire,
then be on your way.

51:51.541 --> 51:54.472
I was going to offer you something
worth one thousand crowns,

51:54.473 --> 51:56.485
would have made you
rich beyond belief.

51:56.486 --> 51:58.483
And that wasn't even the best part.

51:58.484 --> 52:00.070
Oh well, C'est la vie.

52:00.071 --> 52:02.324
Enjoy  your crown.

52:04.021 --> 52:05.565
What's the best part?

52:06.029 --> 52:10.918
It comes with revenge
on Flynn Ryder.

52:17.537 --> 52:22.285
So you're being strangely cryptic as  you wrap
your magic hair around my injured hand.

52:23.273 --> 52:24.689
Sorry.

52:25.590 --> 52:30.261
Just don't, don't freak out.

52:35.502 --> 52:39.330
<i>*Flower gleam and glow*</i>

52:39.331 --> 52:43.750
<i>*Let your powers shine*</i>

52:43.751 --> 52:47.749
<i>*Make the clock reverse*</i>

52:47.750 --> 52:51.403
<i>*Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

52:51.404 --> 52:56.446
<i>*Heal what has been hurt.*</i>

52:56.447 --> 53:00.721
<i>*Change the fates design.*</i>

53:00.722 --> 53:04.929
<i>*Save what has been lost.*</i>

53:04.930 --> 53:08.023
<i>*Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

53:08.024 --> 53:13.870
<i>*What once was mine.*</i>

53:27.657 --> 53:29.118
-Ah...
-Please don't freak out.

53:33.316 --> 53:35.520
Ahhh. I'm not freaking out,
are you freaking out?

53:35.521 --> 53:38.984
No, I'm just very interested in your hair.
and the magical qualities that it possesses.

53:38.985 --> 53:40.783
How long has it been
doing that, exactly?

53:42.429 --> 53:44.575
Forever, I guess.

53:45.853 --> 53:49.109
Mother said when I was a baby
people tried to cut it.

53:49.110 --> 53:51.504
They wanted to take it for themselves.

53:51.514 --> 53:53.811
But, once it's cut.

53:53.812 --> 53:56.500
It turns brown, and looses its power.

53:57.194 --> 54:00.837
A gift like that, it has to be protected.

54:01.375 --> 54:04.080
That's why Mother never let me...

54:07.454 --> 54:12.027
That's why...I never left the...

54:13.734 --> 54:15.928
You never left that tower.

54:19.628 --> 54:21.945
And you're still gonna go back?

54:22.247 --> 54:24.686
No...yes.

54:26.423 --> 54:28.433
It's complicated.

54:39.263 --> 54:42.318
So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

54:42.319 --> 54:46.072
Ah yeah, well. I'll spare
you the sob story of

54:46.073 --> 54:49.160
poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert, it's
a little bit of a...

54:49.161 --> 54:50.873
It's a little bit of a downer.

54:57.146 --> 54:58.741
There was this book.

54:58.742 --> 55:01.342
A book I used to read every
night to all the younger kids.

55:01.343 --> 55:03.160
The tales of Flynnigan Ryder.

55:03.161 --> 55:05.960
Swashbuckling rogue,
richest man alive.

55:05.961 --> 55:09.943
Not bad with the ladies either. Nothing
to ever brag about, of course.

55:10.859 --> 55:12.461
Was he a thief too?

55:12.462 --> 55:16.099
Ahh, well no.

55:16.100 --> 55:19.645
Actually, he had enough
money to do anything that he wanted to do.

55:19.646 --> 55:21.378
He could go anywhere that
he wanted to go.

55:21.394 --> 55:24.568
And...and, for a kid,
with nothing.

55:24.569 --> 55:26.582
I don't know, I...

55:27.593 --> 55:29.065
It just seemed like a better option.

55:29.845 --> 55:32.561
You can't tell anyone,
about this, okay?

55:32.563 --> 55:35.127
It could ruin my whole reputation.

55:35.406 --> 55:38.034
Ahh, we wouldn't want that.

55:38.035 --> 55:40.806
Oh, the thing about a reputation,
it's all that a man has.

55:40.808 --> 55:42.243
(Laughs)

55:48.113 --> 55:51.126
Um, well I should uh...

55:51.806 --> 55:54.572
I, I should get some
more firewood.

55:55.186 --> 55:56.203
Hey.

55:57.304 --> 56:02.605
For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert
much better than, Flynn Ryder.

56:04.506 --> 56:07.394
Well, then you'd be the first.

56:08.057 --> 56:09.379
But, thank you.

56:18.232 --> 56:21.523
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

56:21.524 --> 56:22.822
Mother?

56:22.823 --> 56:24.827
Hello, dear.

56:24.828 --> 56:26.943
But I...I..., don't we...

56:27.157 --> 56:28.965
How did you find me?

56:28.966 --> 56:30.901
Oh, it was easy really.

56:30.902 --> 56:35.381
I just listened for the sound of
complete and utter betrayal,
and followed that.

56:37.762 --> 56:39.963
-Mother...
-We're going home, Rapunzel.

56:39.964 --> 56:42.390
-Now.
-You...You don't understand.

56:42.391 --> 56:44.226
I've been on this incredible journey.

56:44.227 --> 56:46.437
And I've seen and learned so much.

56:47.550 --> 56:49.231
I even met someone.

56:49.232 --> 56:51.573
Yes, the wanted thief.
I'm so proud.

56:51.574 --> 56:53.691
-Come on, Rapunzel.
-Mother, wait.

56:54.004 --> 56:55.231
I think

56:56.571 --> 56:58.715
I think he likes me.

56:58.716 --> 57:01.334
Likes you? Please, Rapunzel,
that's demented.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.375
-But mother, I...
-This is why you never should have left.

57:05.489 --> 57:08.581
Dear this whole romance that
you've invented,

57:08.582 --> 57:13.355
just proves you're to naive to be here.

57:13.355 --> 57:16.633
Why would he like you?
Oh come on now, really.

57:17.192 --> 57:19.918
Look at you, you think
that he's impressed?

57:20.766 --> 57:24.270
Don't be a dummy, come with mommy.

57:25.234 --> 57:26.330
<i>*Mother...*</i>

57:26.331 --> 57:29.774
-NO!
-No?

57:31.152 --> 57:32.636
Oh.

57:32.636 --> 57:34.658
I see how it is.

57:37.163 --> 57:39.263
<i>*Rapunzel, knows best.*</i>

57:39.264 --> 57:41.098
<i>*Rapunzel's so mature, now.*</i>

57:41.099 --> 57:43.740
<i>*Such a clever grown up, miss.*</i>

57:43.741 --> 57:46.232
<i>*Rapunzel knows best.*</i>

57:46.233 --> 57:48.349
<i>*Fine, if you're so sure now.*</i>

57:48.350 --> 57:50.688
<i>*Go ahead then give him, THIS!*</i>

57:50.689 --> 57:51.879
How did you?

57:51.880 --> 57:53.776
<i>*This is why he's here.*</i>

57:53.778 --> 57:55.159
<i>*Don't let him deceive you.*</i>

57:55.160 --> 57:58.593
<i>*Give it to him, watch, you'll see.*
-I will.</i>

57:58.594 --> 58:02.229

58:10.030 --> 58:13.898
<i>*Go and put him, to the test.*
-Mother, wait.</i>

58:13.899 --> 58:19.746
<i>*If he's lying, don't come
crying.*</i>

58:19.747 --> 58:26.351
<i>*Mother, knows best.*</i>

58:30.819 --> 58:34.541
So, hey uh, can I ask you something?

58:35.294 --> 58:38.785
Is there any chance that I'm going
to get super strength in my hand?

58:38.786 --> 58:41.733
Because I'm not going to lie.
That would be stupendous.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.911
Hey, you all right?

58:45.306 --> 58:47.594
Oh, sorry, yes.

58:47.595 --> 58:50.827
Just um, lost in thought,
I guess.

58:53.074 --> 58:55.139
I mean because here's the thing.

58:55.140 --> 58:57.178
Superhuman good looks,
I've always had 'em.

58:57.179 --> 58:59.970
Born with it, but superhuman strength?

58:59.971 --> 59:02.716
Can you imagine the possibilities, I'm just...

59:07.343 --> 59:14.042
Patience boys. All good things
to those who wait.

59:28.691 --> 59:29.791
Hmm, what?

59:32.984 --> 59:35.430
Well I hope you're
here to apologize.

59:36.280 --> 59:39.042
AAAAAAAH!

59:39.051 --> 59:43.504
No, no put me down.
Stop it. Let...me...go!

59:44.526 --> 59:46.740
-Give me, him.
-OW!

59:54.905 --> 59:55.938
Whoa!

59:55.939 --> 59:57.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:57.733 --> 01:00:00.250
Easy boy, easy,
calm down.

01:00:02.323 --> 01:00:03.545
Easy boy.

01:00:04.402 --> 01:00:05.623
Easy.

01:00:07.355 --> 01:00:09.085
That's it.

01:00:12.656 --> 01:00:14.386
Now sit.

01:00:15.252 --> 01:00:17.218
-Sit.
-What?

01:00:17.219 --> 01:00:19.130
Now drop the boot.

01:00:19.312 --> 01:00:20.771
Drop it.

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:25.836
Oh, you are such a good boy.

01:00:25.837 --> 01:00:28.323
Yes you are.

01:00:29.752 --> 01:00:33.356
You all tired, from chasing the bad
man all over the place?

01:00:33.357 --> 01:00:34.499
Flynn: Excuse me?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.397
Nobody appreciates
you, do they?

01:00:37.398 --> 01:00:38.428
Do they?

01:00:38.429 --> 01:00:41.014
Oh come on, he's a bad horse.

01:00:41.015 --> 01:00:43.517
Oh, he's nothing but
a big sweetheart.

01:00:43.518 --> 01:00:45.336
Isn't that right?

01:00:46.361 --> 01:00:47.599
Maximus.

01:00:48.565 --> 01:00:50.308
You've got to be
kidding me.

01:00:50.767 --> 01:00:55.250
Look, today is kinda the
biggest day of my life.

01:00:55.828 --> 01:01:00.290
And the thing is, I need you
not to get him arrested.

01:01:00.522 --> 01:01:03.004
Just for twenty four hours and then,

01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:05.264
you can chase each other to
your hearts content.

01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:06.318
Okay?

01:01:10.527 --> 01:01:14.350
And it's also my birthday.
Just so you know.

01:01:26.982 --> 01:01:27.999
OOMPH!!

01:01:33.392 --> 01:01:34.471
(Mouths) WOW

01:02:04.149 --> 01:02:05.166
Ahh!

01:02:05.998 --> 01:02:07.866
Sorry.

01:02:15.919 --> 01:02:16.938
(Flynn whistles)

01:02:30.587 --> 01:02:31.686
Thank you.

01:02:47.433 --> 01:02:49.832
It's for the lost Princess.

01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:28.912
(Snickers)

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.621
To the boats

01:04:20.747 --> 01:04:22.154
Hey, Max.

01:04:25.431 --> 01:04:27.901
What? I brought them.

01:04:31.123 --> 01:04:32.953
Most of them.

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:35.706
Where are we going?

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:37.960
Well, best day of your life.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.962
I figured you should have
a decent seat.

01:04:57.899 --> 01:04:59.494
You okay?

01:05:00.632 --> 01:05:02.164
I'm terrified.

01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:04.511
Why?

01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:09.130
I've been looking out the
window for eighteen years.

01:05:09.131 --> 01:05:13.980
Dreaming about what it would feel
like when those lights rise in the sky.

01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:19.177
What if it's not everything
that I dreamed it would be?

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.167
It will be.

01:05:24.531 --> 01:05:26.507
And what if it is?

01:05:27.678 --> 01:05:29.612
What will I do then?

01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:31.374
Well that's the good part,
I guess.

01:05:32.187 --> 01:05:34.346
You get to go find a new dream.

01:05:56.812 --> 01:05:58.848

I should have given it to you
before, but I was just scared.

And the thing is,
I'm not scared anymore.

Huh? Oh yes.

01:10:47.789 --> 01:10:49.994
Uh, yes of course.

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:52.013
I just...

01:10:57.604 --> 01:10:59.294
I'm sorry, everything is fine.

01:11:00.379 --> 01:11:01.904
There's just something I
have to take care of.

01:11:04.977 --> 01:11:06.591
Okay.

01:11:07.857 --> 01:11:09.883
I'll be right back.

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:17.776
It's all right, Pascal.

01:11:25.578 --> 01:11:27.135
Ahh, there you are.

01:11:27.136 --> 01:11:30.306
I've been searching everywhere for
you guys. Since we got separated.

01:11:30.307 --> 01:11:32.806
Hey the sideburns are coming
in nice, huh?

01:11:32.808 --> 01:11:34.374
You gotta be excited about that.

01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:39.708
Anyhow, just wanted to say,

01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:42.569
I shouldn't have split.
The crown is all yours.

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:46.781
I'll miss you, but I think
its for the... best.

01:11:47.993 --> 01:11:51.439
Holding out on us again?
Hey, Ryder?

01:11:51.694 --> 01:11:54.697
-What?
-We heard you found something.

01:11:54.698 --> 01:11:57.843
Something much more valuable
than a crown.

01:11:58.323 --> 01:12:01.642
We want her, instead.

01:12:10.612 --> 01:12:15.304
I was starting to think you
ran off with the crown and left me.

01:12:21.665 --> 01:12:23.427
He did.

01:12:24.152 --> 01:12:26.413
What?
No.

01:12:26.414 --> 01:12:27.437
He wouldn't.

01:12:28.204 --> 01:12:30.079
See for yourself.

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:35.915
Eugene?

01:12:38.502 --> 01:12:39.881
Eugene!

01:12:42.463 --> 01:12:44.128
Fair trade.

01:12:44.129 --> 01:12:47.760
A crown, for the girl
with the magic hair.

01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:52.724
How much do you think someone
will pay to stay young and healthy forever?

01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:54.569
No, please.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.893
NO!

01:12:56.191 --> 01:12:57.261
NO!

01:13:00.674 --> 01:13:01.692
AHH!

01:13:14.386 --> 01:13:17.096
Oh, my precious girl.

01:13:17.097 --> 01:13:18.787
Mother.

01:13:19.415 --> 01:13:20.943
Are you all right?

01:13:20.944 --> 01:13:22.274
Are you hurt?

01:13:22.275 --> 01:13:25.742
-Mother, how did you?
-I was so worried about
you dear.

01:13:25.743 --> 01:13:27.154
So I followed you.

01:13:27.155 --> 01:13:29.019
And I saw them attack you.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.843
All right, let's go, let's go
before they come to.

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.630
You were right, mother.

01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:06.277
You were right about everything.

01:14:07.153 --> 01:14:08.949
I know darling.

01:14:10.517 --> 01:14:11.535
I know.

01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:25.589
Look!

01:14:26.349 --> 01:14:27.572
The crown.

01:14:28.092 --> 01:14:29.517
Rapunzel.

01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:31.575
RAPUNZEL!

01:14:34.633 --> 01:14:36.114
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Guys, guys.

01:14:38.998 --> 01:14:40.947
Rapunzel!

01:15:00.345 --> 01:15:02.521
Let's get this over with, Ryder.

01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:05.874
Where are we going?

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:10.978
Oh...

01:15:13.812 --> 01:15:16.396
There, it never happened.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.997
Now, wash up for dinner.

01:15:21.002 --> 01:15:23.700
I'm making hazel nut soup.

01:15:28.108 --> 01:15:31.207
I really did try, Rapunzel.

01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:33.437
I tried to warn you,
what was out there.

01:15:34.334 --> 01:15:37.359
The world is dark, and selfish,

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.598
and cruel.

01:15:38.598 --> 01:15:41.818
If it finds even the slightest
ray of sunshine.

01:15:41.819 --> 01:15:44.750
It destroys it.

01:17:26.465 --> 01:17:28.482
How did you know about her?

01:17:28.484 --> 01:17:29.633
Tell me, now!

01:17:29.634 --> 01:17:30.884
It wasn't us.

01:17:30.884 --> 01:17:32.355
It was the old lady.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:33.985
Old lady?

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.478
Wait, no, wait!

01:17:37.479 --> 01:17:39.312
You don't understand,
she's in trouble.

01:17:39.313 --> 01:17:40.272
Wait!

01:17:40.528 --> 01:17:41.546
Rapunzel?

01:17:43.464 --> 01:17:45.367
Rapunzel, what's going on up there?

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.133
Are you all right?

01:17:52.513 --> 01:17:54.074
I'm the lost princess.

01:17:54.556 --> 01:17:58.179
Oh, please, speak up, Rapunzel.
You know how I hate the mumbling.

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.065
I am the lost Princess.

01:18:00.799 --> 01:18:02.106
Aren't I?

01:18:05.359 --> 01:18:07.787
Did I mumble, Mother?

01:18:08.253 --> 01:18:10.730
Or should I even call you that?

01:18:12.276 --> 01:18:15.248
Oh, Rapunzel, do you even hear yourself?

01:18:15.249 --> 01:18:17.846
Why would you ask such
a ridiculous question?

01:18:17.847 --> 01:18:21.054
It was you!
It was all, you.

01:18:23.278 --> 01:18:26.933
Everything I did, was to protect you.

01:18:28.529 --> 01:18:31.696
-Rapunzel.
-I spent my entire life,

01:18:31.697 --> 01:18:34.670
Hiding from people who
would use me for my power.

01:18:34.671 --> 01:18:37.151
-Rapunzel!
-And I should have been hiding.

01:18:37.152 --> 01:18:38.195
From you.

01:18:38.196 --> 01:18:39.407
Where will you go?

01:18:39.407 --> 01:18:41.394
He won't be there for you.

01:18:41.395 --> 01:18:43.221
What did you do to him?

01:18:43.222 --> 01:18:47.207
That criminal, is to
be hanged for his crimes.

01:18:47.324 --> 01:18:50.916
-No.
-Now, now. It's all right.

01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:51.978
Listen to me.

01:18:51.979 --> 01:18:55.471
All of this is as
it should be.

01:18:55.472 --> 01:18:56.578
NO!

01:18:57.295 --> 01:18:59.903
You were wrong about the world.

01:18:59.904 --> 01:19:02.149
And you were wrong about me.

01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:06.655
And I will never let you
use my hair, again!

01:19:16.032 --> 01:19:17.681
You want me to be the bad guy?

01:19:17.682 --> 01:19:19.578
Fine.

01:19:19.579 --> 01:19:22.103
Now I'm the bad, guy.

01:19:36.196 --> 01:19:37.528
What's this?

01:19:37.923 --> 01:19:39.408
Open up.

01:19:40.412 --> 01:19:42.219
What's the password?

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.984
-What?
-Nope.

01:19:43.985 --> 01:19:45.617
Open this door.

01:19:45.618 --> 01:19:47.522
Not even close.

01:19:47.523 --> 01:19:48.722
You have three seconds

01:19:48.723 --> 01:19:50.111
One...

01:19:51.327 --> 01:19:52.346
Two...

01:19:54.161 --> 01:19:55.457
Three...

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.991
(((Clang!)))

01:20:00.423 --> 01:20:03.139
Frying pans.
Who knew, right?

01:20:06.693 --> 01:20:07.711
AAAAH!

01:20:19.694 --> 01:20:20.778
(Thug roars)

01:20:32.705 --> 01:20:34.008
-Head down?
-Head down.

01:20:34.009 --> 01:20:35.118
-Arms in?
-Arms in.

01:20:35.119 --> 01:20:36.193
-Knees apart?
-Knees apart.

01:20:36.194 --> 01:20:37.177
Knees apart?

01:20:37.751 --> 01:20:40.364
Why do I need to keep my
knees apar...

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:43.606
AAAAAAAAH!

01:20:47.677 --> 01:20:49.086
Max.

01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:51.090
You brought them here?

01:20:53.321 --> 01:20:54.480
Thank you.

01:20:55.845 --> 01:20:58.528
No really, thank you.

01:20:58.528 --> 01:21:04.243
Uh, I feel maybe this whole time
we've just misunderstanding one another.

01:21:04.244 --> 01:21:07.416
And we're really just, yeah
your right. We should go.

01:21:15.094 --> 01:21:16.194
Max.

01:21:16.707 --> 01:21:17.734
Max!

01:21:20.822 --> 01:21:23.393
WHOAAAAA!

01:21:29.438 --> 01:21:33.007
Okay Max, lets see how
fast you can run.

01:21:51.723 --> 01:21:53.385
Rapunzel.

01:21:54.953 --> 01:21:56.866
Rapunzel, let down your hair.

01:22:12.616 --> 01:22:15.085
Rapunzel, I thought I'd never
see you again.

01:22:23.882 --> 01:22:25.945
Now look what you've done,
Rapunzel.

01:22:26.727 --> 01:22:28.368
Oh don't worry, dear.

01:22:28.369 --> 01:22:30.727
Our secret will die with him.

01:22:32.172 --> 01:22:34.182
And as for us?

01:22:35.731 --> 01:22:40.288
We are going where no one
will ever find you, again.

01:22:46.764 --> 01:22:50.266
Rapunzel, really.
Enough all ready.

01:22:50.267 --> 01:22:52.764
Stop fighting me.

01:22:52.766 --> 01:22:55.176
NO! I won't stop.

01:22:55.177 --> 01:22:58.849
For every minute of the rest
of my life I will fight.

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:02.667
I will never stop trying
to get away from you.

01:23:04.881 --> 01:23:07.577
But, if you let me save him...

01:23:07.578 --> 01:23:09.278
I will go with you.

01:23:09.964 --> 01:23:13.247
No. No, Rapunzel.

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:17.164
I'll never run, I'll never
try to escape.

01:23:17.165 --> 01:23:20.965
Just let me heal him. And
you and I will be together.

01:23:20.966 --> 01:23:22.770
Forever, just like you want.

01:23:22.771 --> 01:23:25.004
Everything will be
the way it was.

01:23:26.052 --> 01:23:28.047
I promise.

01:23:28.367 --> 01:23:30.169
Just like you want.

01:23:33.218 --> 01:23:36.506
Just...let me...heal him.

01:23:42.357 --> 01:23:45.967
In case you get any ideas
about following us.

01:23:47.016 --> 01:23:48.907
Eu..Eugene!

01:23:50.346 --> 01:23:52.772
Ah, AHHH!

01:23:54.127 --> 01:23:56.822
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:59.351
-Everything is going to okay, though.
-No, Rapunzel!

01:23:59.352 --> 01:24:01.756
-I promise, you have to trust me.
-No..

01:24:01.757 --> 01:24:04.522
-Come on.
-I can't let you do this.

01:24:04.523 --> 01:24:07.132
And I can't let you die.

01:24:07.133 --> 01:24:09.844
-But if you do this.
-Shhh.

01:24:09.846 --> 01:24:11.981
-Then you...will die.
-Hey.

01:24:13.262 --> 01:24:15.019
It's gonna be all right.

01:24:20.285 --> 01:24:23.340
Rapunzel, wait...

01:24:32.598 --> 01:24:34.600
Eugene, what...?

01:24:34.677 --> 01:24:36.307
NOOO!

01:24:41.121 --> 01:24:44.029
No...NO!

01:24:44.491 --> 01:24:48.447
What have you done?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

01:24:54.835 --> 01:24:57.906
No, no, no,
NOOO!

01:24:58.446 --> 01:25:02.178
No, no, no, noooo.

01:25:04.090 --> 01:25:05.107
NO!

01:25:06.186 --> 01:25:08.123
Noooooooooo!

01:25:26.346 --> 01:25:28.852
No, no, no, no, Eugene.

01:25:31.639 --> 01:25:34.040
Oh, look at me, look me,
I'm right here.

01:25:34.041 --> 01:25:36.146
Don't go, stay with me, Eugene.

01:25:36.146 --> 01:25:39.519
<i>*Flower gleam and glow,
Let your powers shine*</i>

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.310
<i>*Make the clock reverse,
bring back what once was mine.*</i>

01:25:43.311 --> 01:25:45.695
-Rapunzel...
-What?

01:25:48.382 --> 01:25:50.426
You were my new dream.

01:25:53.742 --> 01:25:55.669
And you were mine.

01:26:22.048 --> 01:26:25.826
<i>*Heal what has been hurt.*</i>

01:26:26.706 --> 01:26:30.982
<i>*Change the fates design.*</i>

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:35.086
<i>*Save what has been lost.*</i>

01:26:37.646 --> 01:26:40.631
<i>*Bring back what once was mine.*</i>

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:46.126
What once was mine.

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.245
Rapunzel?

01:27:45.603 --> 01:27:46.783
Eugene.

01:27:48.699 --> 01:27:51.974
Did I ever tell you, I've
got a thing for brunettes?

01:29:34.778 --> 01:29:38.935
<i>(Eugene narrates)
Well, you could imagine what
happened next.</i>

01:29:40.616 --> 01:29:42.493
<i>The kingdom rejoiced.</i>

01:29:42.494 --> 01:29:44.305
<i>For the lost Princess had returned.</i>

01:29:44.306 --> 01:29:46.463
<i>The party lasted an entire week.</i>

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:49.079
<i>And, honestly I don't
remember much of it.</i>

01:29:50.004 --> 01:29:51.708
<i>Dreams came true
all over the place.</i>

01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:55.923
<i>That guy went on to become the
most famous concert pianist in the world,
if you can believe it.</i>

01:29:58.502 --> 01:30:01.134
<i>And this guy? Well he eventually
found true love.</i>

01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:05.208
<i>As for this guy, well,
I assume he's happy.</i>

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.720
<i>He's never told me otherwise.</i>

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:13.195
<i>Thanks to Maximus, crime in the kingdom
disappeared almost over night.</i>

01:30:14.811 --> 01:30:16.660
<i>As did most of the apples.</i>

01:30:18.817 --> 01:30:21.836
<i>Pascal? 
Never changed.</i>

01:30:25.576 --> 01:30:27.957
<i>At last Rapunzel was home,</i>

01:30:27.958 --> 01:30:29.651
<i>and she finally had a real family.</i>

01:30:31.308 --> 01:30:33.456
<i>She was a Princess worth
waiting for.</i>

01:30:34.158 --> 01:30:35.857
<i>Beloved by all, she led her kingdom</i>

01:30:35.858 --> 01:30:39.198
<i>with all the grace and wisdom that
her parents did before her.</i>

01:30:40.078 --> 01:30:41.963
<i>And as for me, well.</i>

01:30:41.964 --> 01:30:43.542
<i>I started going by Eugene again.</i>

01:30:43.543 --> 01:30:45.686
<i>Stopped thieving, and basically
turned it all around.</i>

01:30:45.687 --> 01:30:47.427
<i>But I know what the big question is.</i>

01:30:48.298 --> 01:30:50.084
<i>Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?</i>

01:30:50.717 --> 01:30:51.750
<i>Well I'm pleased to tell you.</i>

01:30:51.753 --> 01:30:54.517
<i>That after years, and years of asking,</i>

01:30:54.518 --> 01:30:56.518
<i>and asking, and asking.</i>

01:30:58.215 --> 01:31:00.139
<i>I finally said yes.</i>

01:31:00.352 --> 01:31:01.903
*Eugene*

01:31:01.905 --> 01:31:04.685
<i>All right, I asked her.</i>

01:31:04.686 --> 01:31:06.758
And we're living happily ever after.

01:31:08.025 --> 01:31:09.428
Yes, we are.
