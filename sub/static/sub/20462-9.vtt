Hey, that rent's pretty cheap.
Make that your new office space.

02:17.053 --> 02:20.348
Nah, it's too dark and scary.
I'd probably end up chained to a wall

02:20.431 --> 02:22.767

hands me a dull knife.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.353
Ugh! Those movies are disgusting.

-Shane, did you see <i>Saw?</i>
-Don't want any part in this.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.116

I'm still mad at you.

[Shane on recording] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:46.499

02:46.583 --> 02:47.917
Sorry don't save you.

That is why you must play my evil game.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.633
-[in a low voice] The choice is yours.
-[Sophia] Mm-hmm.

02:55.717 --> 03:01.389
You can either solve the square root of 16
or hang by your bowels.

03:01.472 --> 03:02.557
That is tough.

03:02.932 --> 03:06.144
What will I choose? On one hand,
I've never hung by my bowels...

03:06.644 --> 03:08.563
but... four.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.441

-Another one gets away.

Oh! Dax is home from school.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.157
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:19.782 --> 03:24.412
Hey, do all the other kids in your class
dig that kick-ass lunchbox?

03:24.662 --> 03:26.331
They do. All of us have one.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.208
Oh, yeah. Don't listen to her, baby.
The lunchbox is sexy.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.169
Ooh! Check this one out.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.381
Okay. We've got utilities
and air conditioning thrown in.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.258
Easy access to downtown.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.426
Views of the Alamo.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.095
Oh, wait. This is in San Antonio.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.723
My cousin rents office space
for his plumbing company.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.933
I could give him a call.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.100
Or I could Ask Jeeves.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.394
He seems to know a lot
about a lot of stuff.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.606
Or you can ask the guy
who studies how variable mortgage rates

03:51.689 --> 03:54.692
in commercially zoned districts
encourages business development.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.777
Oh, my God.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.363
Annie, can I choose the bear trap
on my head

03:58.446 --> 04:01.783
-over listening to this guy talk?
-[in a low voice] Yes, you may, Sophia.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.619
Just focus your search
on 6th and Harrison.

04:04.869 --> 04:05.703
You're welcome.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.746
Dax.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.624
Okay, no lie,
you are the least helpful human being

04:09.707 --> 04:13.336
on the planet.
Where did he say I should just look?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.507
[man] This is perfect space for you.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.842
-What else do you need?
-A window would be nice.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.594
I know Apple was started in a garage,

04:21.678 --> 04:24.597
but I doubt
I can grow the sploinked.com<i> </i>empire

04:24.681 --> 04:27.433
-out of this coffin.
-Okay, okay. I have bigger space.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.311
Top floor. It's more money, but you like.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.860
I don't think so.
I heard some dogs bark on the way in,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.321
and I need total silence to ideate.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.491
No, hey. No, hey. For you, I kill dogs!

04:43.574 --> 04:46.077
Yes. Bring the dogs in here.
They'll kill themselves.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.746
-What do you want?
-Office space!

04:48.830 --> 04:49.914
When do I want it?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.624
Now!

04:52.834 --> 04:53.960
[chuckles]

04:54.419 --> 04:56.629
It's actually very funny in this country.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.714
You want office space?

04:57.797 --> 05:00.216
Yeah.
But it's gotta be better than this dump.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.384
I have nothing for you.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.595
Really? What about the bigger space
on the top floor?

05:04.679 --> 05:06.222
No. That one's not for you.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.349
It's expensive.
Twice as much as this place.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.643
You don't think I can afford it
because I'm a woman?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.186
You're not woman, you're girl.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.231
There are many metrics
by which girls become women,

05:15.315 --> 05:16.816
and I meet all them, dude.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.027
I get my period.
I can join the Coast Guard.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.780
I legally enter the Stoli vodka website.
Though there is a clever hack for that.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.533
When they ask you
to put in the year that you were born,

05:25.616 --> 05:28.244
-all you have to do is--
-Okay. You talk too much, like woman.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.039
Don't love the stereotype,
but I'll take it.

05:31.539 --> 05:38.046
And... I can give you three months' rent
in cash today.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.132
Lookin' at a lot of Benjamins. What, what?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.926
Eh. Follow me.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.202
I'll take it!

06:11.287 --> 06:12.497
Please, print legibly.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.831
Block letters only.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.875
Amen, brother. Cursive is bullshit.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.627
So, what exactly is your business?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.671
Basically I buy vintage clothes for cheap,
make them look nice,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.465
and then sell them online for more money.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.636
You know how people flip houses?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.388
Well, I flip clothes.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.934
Oh, did I just detect the tiniest gleam
of interest on your face?

06:33.017 --> 06:35.603
-My store, it's called Nasty Gal.
-Okay. Hey.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.106
I need the name and number
of your current landlord.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.235
Uh, sure. What for?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.737
So I can call them
and ask if you pay rent on time.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.615
Right. Let me find his number.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.249
[Lionel] <i>Bitch, what?</i>

06:57.583 --> 06:59.919
And sign in there.
Lets me run your credit.

07:00.002 --> 07:03.005
-Can I give you a number for that, too?
-There's agency for that.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.215
Is there a problem?

07:04.298 --> 07:05.133
No.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.053
I mean,
you will find that I do have bad credit.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.556
But that's not my fault.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.767
You see, a while back, I needed a new bra,
because none of mine fit.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.271
And Oprah told me that 99 percent
of women are wearing the wrong bra size.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.649
So, I go to Victoria's Secret,
and find out that you get half off a bra

07:21.732 --> 07:24.444
if you open a credit card, so, I did.
But then I moved.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.737
Never got the bill. Hence, never paid it.

07:26.821 --> 07:31.617
And this fucking bill, for like 19 bucks,
ends up obliterating my credit.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.287
And the real dick punch,
the bra never fit.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.999
And I only wore it like twice.
So, really, the lesson here is,

07:38.082 --> 07:41.961
-never think you're smarter than Oprah.
-All right. But you'll need cosigner.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.338
No, I don't need any help signing.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.007
I can do it all by myself.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.804
That's not what a cosigner is, is it?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.348
Who am I gonna get to cosign?

07:55.099 --> 07:57.685
People with money don't usually trust
with abandon.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.146
I know who you could ask.

08:00.771 --> 08:01.772
Don't say it.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.275
-Your incredibly sexy...
-Don't you say it.

08:04.358 --> 08:08.154
-monumentally virile...
-[groans] Don't you dare say it!

08:08.237 --> 08:09.947
I'm not asking my dad for help.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.866
No, no. I will find someone else.

08:12.116 --> 08:15.077
Anyone else.
Maybe I could make up a guy to cosign.

08:15.369 --> 08:18.998
-You mean a guy like Henry...
-[both] Riffraff!

08:19.081 --> 08:21.083
Ah! The perfect fake boyfriend.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.003
Creepy randos just will not harass you
at a bar

08:24.086 --> 08:25.755
if they think you're dating a smokejumper.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.173
One who has to find new work

08:27.256 --> 08:29.759
because he was kicked out
of the Navy SEALs for his temper.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.802
Yeah, he was. [laughs]

08:31.886 --> 08:33.846
Oh, no. Don't use Henry, though.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.432
That's fraud. It's generally frowned upon.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.559
You seem nice.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.019
Can you cosign?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.813
Come on. No one our age can be a cosigner.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.816
You gotta have, like, savings
and assets and shit.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.985
I do not wanna ask my dad.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.779
Maybe he'll surprise you.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.949
Only time he's ever surprised me
is when he told me without a doubt

08:53.032 --> 08:54.575
that he's never stepped in gum.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.246
I believe it.
Those lithe, agile haunches of his...

08:58.871 --> 09:01.374
-Annie, he won't get it.
-Then explain it to him.

09:01.457 --> 09:04.085
How? The only thing he responds to
is lame-ass shit,

09:04.168 --> 09:07.672
like numbers and charts and spreadsheets.
I don't know anything about that.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.799
-What, am I a super nerd?
-No.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.219
But I'm deep-dicking one who is.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.638
So, why should I help you?

09:15.721 --> 09:16.806
'Cause you're smart.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.101
Hey, were you the guy
who started putting lemon in Diet Coke?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.270
'Cause I see that everywhere now.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.397
And also, this.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.942
Mm! Apparently Annie's gonna...

09:29.318 --> 09:30.403
mangle your penis.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.740
I think the real question is,
why shouldn't you help me?

09:34.824 --> 09:38.077
For one, you consistently give me shit
about going to business school.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.871
No, I totally respect the fact
that you're going to school.

09:42.081 --> 09:42.999
As a grown man.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.918
-Is that you trying to soften me up?
-No, no, that's Annie's job.

09:46.002 --> 09:46.919
Ah...

09:47.628 --> 09:49.463
-What is that?
-[Annie] He knows.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.215
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

09:51.799 --> 09:52.800
Fine, I'll help you.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.552
But I have one condition.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.680
Acknowledge that lunchboxes
are the most evolved form

09:57.763 --> 09:58.806
of food preservation.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.224
No, that's a refrigerator.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.019
Fine. Advanced form
of transportable food preservation.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.104
[snores, groans]

10:05.187 --> 10:06.147
Acknowledged.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.774
-Say it like you mean it.
-Seriously? How old are you?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.234
Dignity has no age.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.612
You two are my favorite people
in the world.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.448
[Dax]
I've plotted your gross revenues on Nap 1.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.284
See how your free cash levels increase
from Nap 2 to Nap 3?

10:18.367 --> 10:19.410
Just say "napkin."

10:19.952 --> 10:22.955
No. Now, if my math is right,
which it always is,

10:23.122 --> 10:24.832
your current rate of growth

10:24.915 --> 10:28.294
puts your next year cash flow projection
right here.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.297
-I'm killing it, right?
-Low overhead, steady demand,

10:31.380 --> 10:32.340
high margins?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.550
Yes, you're killing it.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.886
Low, steady, and high.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.638
-That's your girl.
-[chuckles]

10:39.305 --> 10:43.059
All right, look. Present this to your dad,
and make it look professional. Okay?

10:43.142 --> 10:47.021
And he will see
that you have a legit business here.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.814
Got it. Make the naps look nice.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.483
Oh, my God. I just said "naps."

10:50.566 --> 10:53.819
I'm turning into a fucking nerd like you.
This is gonna go great.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.821
[softly] Yeah. Okay.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.534
Okay. Let's make a bar graph.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.953

Hello, bar graph wizard.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.924
Walk me through this.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.426
[knock on door]

11:17.510 --> 11:18.969
Um, hello?

11:21.430 --> 11:22.473
Wizard?

11:23.432 --> 11:26.310
Woman. You best clean this shitbox up

11:26.394 --> 11:30.189
before you even try asking
for your security deposit back.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.067
Are these holes new?
Don't snow job me now.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.362
[chuckles] Bravo!

11:37.238 --> 11:38.948
It was a performance of a lifetime.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.911
I was beyond convincing
in my role as landlord.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.454
Mm! What did you tell him?

11:45.705 --> 11:51.001
Well... I told him
that you always pay your rent on time.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.587
I said that you are a devout Christian.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.758
And you never, ever flush flushable wipes.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.386
Never? But it's right there in the name.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.388
Look at me. Never.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.432
Okay. Glad you got my back.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.018
Whatever I can do so my working girl
can get that office space,

12:08.436 --> 12:12.106

and have her Melanie Griffith moment.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.275
Tell the world
you've got a head for business,

12:14.358 --> 12:16.819
and a bod for preteen catalog modeling.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.779
[both laughing]

12:18.863 --> 12:21.449
Hey, do you wanna cosign a lease with me?

12:21.532 --> 12:23.033
[laughing loudly]

12:24.326 --> 12:25.578
Okay. All right.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.166
I know, I'm sorry. It's just I--
I have dinner with my dad tomorrow night,

12:30.249 --> 12:32.918
and convincing him
to do it is not gonna be easy.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.545
Oh, yes.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.339
-Having that hard talk with the parents.
-Yeah.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.216
See, you need a buffer.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.761
Why don't you bring
that cute man friend of yours?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.388
Shane? Why?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.641
When I had to have the conversation
with my father,

12:47.725 --> 12:48.976
I was scared to death.

12:49.268 --> 12:55.232
So, I invited my favorite teacher,
Mr. Fenwick, to come over to the house.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.818
-And that helped?
-Yes. Yes, child.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.653
I knew my father wasn't gonna kill me

12:59.820 --> 13:01.780
-with witnesses present.
-Yeah.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.367
I think he saw it coming, though,
because of all the time I was spending

13:05.451 --> 13:07.203
at the pool hall down the street.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.372
Pool hall? Is that some secret gay thing
I've never heard of?

13:11.540 --> 13:14.043
What? No. What are you babbling on about?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.587
Isn't this the story
of coming out to your parents?

13:17.171 --> 13:19.757
No, no, no.
This is when I quit the basketball team.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.426
That's what you refer to
as "the conversation"?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.345
Yes. Yes.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.222
Look at me.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.433
I was made for basketball.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.686
-I'm so confused.
-You'll be fine.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.647
Clean up this mess.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.940
My tongue is heavy.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.234
I feel like I'm gonna... throw up.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.153
-Hey, thanks for the wine.
-Goodbye.

Oh, shit. It happened anyway.

Hey, you got this.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.258
Business speaks for itself.
You're gonna be great.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.052
Say something to distract me.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.764
Okay. I think it's really cool
that I'm meeting your dad.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.392
I'm... anxious, but I'm excited.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.561
But I'm anxious, but, yeah, I...

14:13.644 --> 14:16.021
I mean, have you thought
about how this is a big step for us?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.734
-Right. Not helpful.
-You are a buffer.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.863
You are here to buff.
This is not the night to ask funny stories

14:23.946 --> 14:26.031
from when I was a kid,
or lame shit like that.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.534
-I'll buff the way I wanna buff.
-No stories.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.828
-I'd like to hear two stories.
-Zero stories.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.913
One story it is, okay. Here he comes.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.542
-Dad, hi. Good to see you.
-Hey.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.543
This is a first.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.169
Did I keep you waiting long?

14:39.253 --> 14:40.546
Ha, ha. Very funny.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.020
You show up on time,
you're put together.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.231
You introduce me to a guy
who can form a complete sentence.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.858
All right, Jay. We get it.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.568
I'm just surprised and all.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.697
You like music, Mr. Marlowe?

15:06.780 --> 15:08.490
Yes. Sure.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.411
I've been known to go
to a few concerts in my day.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.749
You know, I once went
to three Guess Who shows in a weekend.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.209
I am a huge Randy Bachman fan.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.545
I actually met his son Tal backstage,

15:21.629 --> 15:24.757
and I asked him if he had a follow-up
to "She's So High" coming out.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.216
And he said, "Nope."

15:26.717 --> 15:28.093
[laughs]

15:29.094 --> 15:31.472
-Sounds like a typical kid, huh?

Yeah. All right.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.440

at the top of her lungs, right?

She looks this pimply kid
right in the eye.

Oh, you know, got a free lunch out of it,
right? So, who's complaining?

16:03.128 --> 16:04.463
Thank you for that one story.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.507
Oh, I got hundreds more just like it.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.302
-All right. Dad?
-Yeah.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.097
-There's something I want to talk about.
-Who left room for dessert?

16:13.180 --> 16:14.640
Oh, could you give us a second?

16:14.723 --> 16:17.559
-[waiter] Sure. Should I bring menus or--?
-One tiramisu, three spoons.

And no one wants coffee.
It's fucking 9:00 p.m.

16:23.357 --> 16:27.903
So... I started a business
reselling vintage clothes on eBay.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.991
-What does that mean?
-You know how people flip houses?

16:32.408 --> 16:35.661
-I flip clothes.
-People lose their shirt flipping houses.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.957
All right. Forget about that.
Let me present you with this.

16:42.501 --> 16:46.005
-A business plan for Nasty Gal.
-Nasty what?

16:48.132 --> 16:50.551
What other kind of music do you like,
Mr. Marlowe?

16:50.634 --> 16:52.803
Dad, please.
I'm going somewhere with this.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.892
In just 14 months,
Nasty Gal has gone from nothing

16:58.976 --> 17:01.854
to one of the most successful eBay stores
operating today.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.858
As you can see here,
we have low, stable operating costs,

17:05.941 --> 17:08.152
combined with an expected increase
in cash flow.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.903
Our profits will rise every month.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.325
If things continue, our projection
for next year is quite impressive.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.077
And in the next five years,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.955
we could be talking
about some crazy-ass numbers.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.209
-I mean, you did all this yourself?
-Yes.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.086
But there's one problem.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.933
and enough cash
to put down months of rent up front.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.811

without a cosigner.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.481
Ahh.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.775
That's why you were on time.

Dad... I don't remember
the last time I said this...

-Mm.

to handle this thing

would be to put the lease in my name.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.491
Check it.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.243
How about this place?

22:08.827 --> 22:10.912
Yeah, right.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.249
No. No, no, no.
You're only seeing what's on the surface.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.209
You're using your man eyes.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.170
Try to see its potential.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.589
You know,
remove all this shit... carefully,

22:20.672 --> 22:24.801
with latex gloves,
and probably a SARS mask or two.

22:25.302 --> 22:29.222
We uncover all the windows,
get that natural light up in here,

22:29.347 --> 22:34.728
clean everything, fumigate,
and we bring your supplies in here,

22:34.811 --> 22:35.896
your inventory.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.941
We make it look cool,
like totally awesome.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.194
Yeah.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.446
This is it.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.450
[man] Which one of you Bruce Lees
ruined my door?

22:48.533 --> 22:51.161
-[Sophia] Oh, you own this place?
-I own the whole damn pier.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.164
Whoa. I think we just thought
you were a retired pirate.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.375
[chuckles] Well, that's
the cleaned-up version of my life.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.295
Now, look,
I never minded you guys taking pictures,

23:00.378 --> 23:02.464
but destruction of property
is another matter.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.842
According to maritime law,
I gotta break one of your legs.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.929
No one's breaking any legs.

23:09.012 --> 23:12.099
If you knew me...
you'd know that was a joke.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.768
[laughing]

23:14.851 --> 23:16.061
My name's Burt Coyote.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.687
All right, Burt.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.523
I'm Sophia Marlowe.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.651
-And I wanna rent this place.
-Heh, well...

23:22.734 --> 23:25.153
Now, I know I may look like a little girl
to you,

23:25.237 --> 23:27.114
but I am here to tell you that I'm not.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.699
Yes, I did throw a tantrum
and break down your door.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.369
And, yes, I may have shit credit
because of a bra.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.746
-And, yeah, I may be a little--
-Hey, hey.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.125
You don't need to prove yourself
to some guy named Burt Coyote.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.085
You're right.

23:41.002 --> 23:41.878
I am a girl.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.381
And that shouldn't be a bad thing.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.759
Girls are collaborative,
empathetic, hard workers.

23:47.843 --> 23:48.802
Girls are great.

23:48.885 --> 23:49.719
Hell, yeah.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.221
Yeah.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.765
-[grunts]
-Yeah.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.020
I have a kick-ass business,
and I can pay you up front in cash.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.899
Here's a thousand-dollar deposit.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.902
The second I'm late with a payment,
this is yours to keep.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.863
I'll be the best tenant you ever had.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.614
We got a deal?

24:09.698 --> 24:12.534
[Carly Simon's "Let the River Run"
playing]

24:12.617 --> 24:13.827

24:13.910 --> 24:14.786
