Okay, looking good in your
little brine bath, buddy.

00:22.847 --> 00:24.347
And tomorrow, somebody's gonna be

00:24.415 --> 00:26.983
the most delicious
Thanksgiving turkey ever.

00:27.018 --> 00:28.017
(high-pitched): "Is it me?"

00:28.086 --> 00:29.452
Sure is, pal.

00:29.521 --> 00:31.420
(bashful chuckle)

00:31.489 --> 00:33.990
All right, I'll check in on you after
we get back from the turkey pardoning,

00:34.058 --> 00:36.025
since our town is doing <i> that</i> now.

00:36.094 --> 00:37.426
"Turkey pardoning?"

00:37.495 --> 00:38.928
I know, right? So dumb.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.297
Treating the turkey like it's a person.

00:41.366 --> 00:43.666
"Yeah, idiots! Wait, but don't you..."

00:43.735 --> 00:45.268
Shh, shh. No, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.869
Ugh, I still can't believe we're wasting

00:46.938 --> 00:49.472
our half day off school to
go see a turkey pardoning.

00:49.541 --> 00:51.040
That I do not pardon.

00:51.109 --> 00:53.376
Yeah, the only Parton
I need to see is Dolly.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.344
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:55.413 --> 00:57.513
We're gonna go to city hall.
We're gonna see the mayor.

00:57.582 --> 00:58.981
The mayor!

00:59.050 --> 01:01.017
Why-why do you love the mayor so much?

01:01.085 --> 01:02.552
What are you talking about?
He's the mayor.

01:02.620 --> 01:05.655
He wears those shirts,
and he's always waving.

01:05.723 --> 01:07.657
- Oh, he's got a great wave.
- It is a good wave.

01:07.725 --> 01:09.892
- He really gets into it.
- It's like his whole body's waving.

01:09.961 --> 01:11.894
He doesn't have any bones.
He's like a fish.

01:11.930 --> 01:13.229
- Fish have bones.
- They do?

01:13.298 --> 01:14.530
Uh, yeah.

01:14.599 --> 01:16.032
I think the pardoning sounds nice.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.533
Giving the turkey a
second chance at life

01:17.602 --> 01:18.901
after being locked up.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.536
The turkey hasn't been to prison.

01:20.572 --> 01:22.004
- What are you, his lawyer?
- Ugh.

01:22.073 --> 01:23.706
The live turkeys are the worst.

01:23.775 --> 01:27.076
Those flesh-mangling beaks
and those beady eyes?

01:27.145 --> 01:30.846
Also, how can you trust an animal
with a head that's that bald and tiny?

01:30.915 --> 01:32.081
I mean, we trust Dad.

01:32.150 --> 01:33.683
- That's true.
- Mm.

01:33.751 --> 01:35.251
All right, people, let's go.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.086
- We're losing daylight.
- Cranberries!

01:37.155 --> 01:38.554
- Language.
- No,

01:38.623 --> 01:40.890
I forgot cranberries
for the cranberry sauce.

01:40.925 --> 01:43.926
We-we got to go to the store
after the thing and get them.

01:43.995 --> 01:47.230
Or... we could just buy canned
cranberry sauce this year.

01:47.298 --> 01:49.865
Yeah. I love big cans. (growls)

01:49.934 --> 01:51.667
What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I know

01:51.736 --> 01:53.069
you ate that sugary
canned cranberry slop

01:53.137 --> 01:54.503
at your grandmother's that one year,

01:54.572 --> 01:56.339
'cause she doesn't care about anything.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.841
- Watch it.
- But we are not eating that junk in the house.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.110
This is a fresh cranberry
sauce house, damn it.

02:01.179 --> 02:02.878
It's who we are!

02:02.947 --> 02:04.947
I like the shape it makes
when it comes out of the can.

02:05.016 --> 02:06.949
- So help me, Tina.
- Sorry.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.989
LINDA: <i>Ugh. They're an hour late.</i>

02:09.024 --> 02:10.620
And what's with the lousy turnout?

02:10.687 --> 02:12.521
This is the mayor's
first turkey pardoning.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.057
- Where's the freaking support?
- Maybe everyone came down

02:15.126 --> 02:17.727
with a bad case of
"I'd rather be anywhere else"?

02:17.795 --> 02:19.395
- (chuckles) Nice.
- (chuckles)

02:19.464 --> 02:20.730
Stop it. No high-fiving.

02:20.798 --> 02:22.064
Ooh! Here comes someone.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.467
Hello, everyone.
Uh, sorry for the delay.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.702
I'm afraid there's been a
change of plans. (chuckles)

02:26.771 --> 02:29.138
The mayor had to... not be here.

02:29.207 --> 02:30.873
He had a mayor emergency.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.276
An e-mayor-gency. Uh...

02:33.311 --> 02:36.112
What? An e-mayor-gency? No!

02:36.180 --> 02:38.714
But, uh, what's almost
as good as the mayor?

02:38.783 --> 02:40.316
- LINDA: Nothing!
- Okay.

02:40.385 --> 02:41.917
- Linda, please stop.
- You stop.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.252
The deputy mayor.

02:43.321 --> 02:45.588
So, may I present to you

02:45.657 --> 02:47.156
Deputy Mayor Daniel Cunningham.

02:47.225 --> 02:49.292
(chuckles) Hello. Thank you.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.993
Hey, why don't we give

02:51.062 --> 02:53.663
a big thanks to the person who
organized this whole event?

02:53.731 --> 02:55.097
Oh, right, it was me.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.099
Yeah, the mayor
delegated it all to me...

02:57.168 --> 03:00.269
no big deal... and he's sorry
he couldn't be here today.

03:00.338 --> 03:02.004
Though not as sorry as his toilet.

03:02.073 --> 03:03.906
#StomachProblems.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.109
How dare he hashtag my
mayor's stomach problems.

03:07.178 --> 03:09.745
Okay. Let's bring up
the star of the show,

03:09.814 --> 03:11.681
Drew P. Neck!

03:11.749 --> 03:12.948
(gobbles)

03:13.017 --> 03:14.450
- Ugh.
- I think he's cute.

03:14.519 --> 03:16.686
Go for it, sister. I don't see a ring.

03:16.754 --> 03:19.121
And after lucky little Drew
P. Neck here gets pardoned,

03:19.190 --> 03:21.357
he's going to live out
his days peacefully

03:21.426 --> 03:24.627
at the Old McDonald Had
a Sanctuary Sanctuary,

03:24.696 --> 03:28.030
where the motto is "E-I-E-I Hope."

03:28.099 --> 03:30.032
Okay, who wants to go stare
at the broken fountain

03:30.101 --> 03:31.667
- that's never worked?
- Ooh, me.

03:31.736 --> 03:33.202
We're having a good childhood.

03:34.129 --> 03:34.970
Hey, cool press badge.

03:35.039 --> 03:36.872
- Are you in the press?
- Uh, yeah.

03:36.941 --> 03:38.708
- I knew it.
- So you actually have to report

03:38.776 --> 03:40.843
- on this crap show?
- I know, right?

03:40.878 --> 03:43.479
Why can't I be covering a
pre-Thanksgiving armed robbery?

03:43.548 --> 03:45.481
Or maybe, like, one little stabbing.

03:45.550 --> 03:47.550
If you give me your pen,
I could stab you in the bottom.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.418
That's very generous,
but, no, thank you.

03:49.487 --> 03:50.820
LOUISE: Well, we're doing it.

03:50.888 --> 03:52.722
We're staring at the broken fountain.

03:52.790 --> 03:54.590
(whistles) Does not disappoint.

03:54.659 --> 03:56.392
WOMAN: Well, dum-dum
Deputy Mayor Cunningham

03:56.461 --> 03:58.994
just had the sanctuary idea
yesterday, Mom.

03:59.063 --> 04:00.996
And the one he picked
can't take the turkey.

04:01.065 --> 04:03.132
They're at capacity. I told you already.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.168
What's going on here?
Gene, Tina, let's drop some eaves.

04:06.237 --> 04:08.204
Well, he told me to drive it to a...
(whispers): slaughterhouse.

04:08.272 --> 04:10.206
A slaughterhouse?
That doesn't sound good.

04:10.274 --> 04:13.576
Maybe she meant "cider house."
That place rules.

04:13.611 --> 04:15.878
I can't just let the turkey go.
It's the most famous bird

04:15.947 --> 04:18.047
in the county. It'll be recognized.

04:18.116 --> 04:20.516
No, I'm not just gonna murder it
and bury it in the woods.

04:20.584 --> 04:21.817
Oh, my sister could do it?

04:21.886 --> 04:23.252
Well, I'm not Lisa!

04:23.321 --> 04:24.854
Look, I'll get home as soon as I can,

04:24.922 --> 04:26.889
but now I have to drive
a turkey to a slaughterhouse

04:26.958 --> 04:30.259
because my career in politics
is going really great!

04:30.328 --> 04:32.094
So the sanctuary stuff is just a lie?

04:32.163 --> 04:33.696
They're taking Drew P.
Neck to a slaughterhouse?

04:33.765 --> 04:35.598
This is, like, a serious scandal.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.933
Eh, I wouldn't really call it a scandal.

04:38.002 --> 04:39.101
It's scand-ish.

04:39.137 --> 04:40.870
A Scand-ish-navian, if you will.

04:40.938 --> 04:42.438
Oh, let's go tell the reporter guy!

04:42.507 --> 04:44.073
Reporters love reporting stuff.

04:44.142 --> 04:45.241
Uh, no.

04:45.309 --> 04:46.709
What? What do you mean, no?

04:46.778 --> 04:48.677
Yeah. I don't take
tips from kids anymore.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.180
Not since my niece told me
about a homework burglar.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.083
Turns out she's just a
terrible student and person.

04:54.152 --> 04:56.252
Now, if you'll excuse me, bye.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.853
Aah! We got to help Drew P.!

04:57.922 --> 04:58.921
What are we gonna do?

04:58.990 --> 05:00.923
Well, we could do nothing?

05:00.992 --> 05:02.758
- Maybe try that?
- Nothing sounds good.

05:02.827 --> 05:04.593
No, we got to... save him.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.362
Or we don't. 'Cause he's nasty.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.364
Or we go on a full-on rescue mission.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.266
Hmm. Rescue mission.

05:10.334 --> 05:12.034
I kind of like the sound of that.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.847
Yes. A turkey rescue mission.

05:13.882 --> 05:14.837
I don't like the "turkey" part.

05:14.906 --> 05:16.272
All right, just a rescue mission.

05:16.307 --> 05:18.007
- Okay, fine, I'm in.
- For a turkey.

05:18.075 --> 05:20.443
I'm in, too. I promised Ken
I'd help him move today,

05:20.511 --> 05:23.646
but screw it. I don't know why
I told him I have a Toyota Tacoma.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.681
And so, Drew P. Neck,

05:25.716 --> 05:29.084
I hereby pardon you from
the Thanksgiving table.

05:29.153 --> 05:31.620
Now, let's get you
to that sanctuary, huh?

05:31.689 --> 05:33.556
We don't have much time.
Let's go tell Mom and Dad.

05:33.624 --> 05:36.091
Or as I call them,
Panache and The 'Stache.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.860
Okay, I'll take a few questions.

05:37.895 --> 05:39.562
You guys have all your
little recorder thingies out?

05:39.630 --> 05:41.163
Uh, you, in the pants.

05:41.199 --> 05:43.766
Will there be a photo op at
the sanctuary later today?

05:43.835 --> 05:45.167
(whispers) That's a stupid question.

05:45.236 --> 05:47.470
Uh, a photo? There? At the sanctuary?

05:47.538 --> 05:50.072
I will have to check about that.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.007
(imitates phone chime) Oh,
I'm getting a text.

05:52.076 --> 05:53.642
Ooh, from the government.

05:53.711 --> 05:55.244
I've got to go, I'm sorry. Good-bye.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.745
Bless you all. Bye-bye.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.948
Hmm. Interesting.

05:59.016 --> 06:00.649
That dirty deputy mayor!

06:00.718 --> 06:02.585
You know, if the real mayor
weren't out of his mind

06:02.620 --> 06:05.154
with diarrhea right now,
none of this would have happened.

06:05.223 --> 06:06.956
So, can we save Drew P. Neck?

06:07.024 --> 06:09.391
I don't know. This all sounds crazy.

06:09.427 --> 06:13.095
I have an idea:
we get justice by going to the store

06:13.164 --> 06:14.363
and buying cranberries.

06:14.432 --> 06:16.432
Bob, we got to save the turkey.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.867
To protect the mayor's legacy.

06:17.935 --> 06:19.335
We can't let them taint it.

06:19.403 --> 06:22.304
- GENE: Yeah, a mayor's taint is sacred.
- Gene.

06:22.373 --> 06:25.808
Look, guys, we don't even know
where Drew P. Neck is right now, so...

06:27.278 --> 06:29.111
- Great.
- Come on, Dad, please?

06:29.180 --> 06:30.513
Do something with your life for once.

06:30.548 --> 06:32.181
(sighs) Okay, fine.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.716
- All right!
- Hooray! - Yeah!

06:33.784 --> 06:35.217
This is a terrible idea.

06:35.286 --> 06:36.452
LOUISE: What? No.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.287
Family turkey rescue?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.322
Well, somebody better call Huey Lewis,

06:40.391 --> 06:42.525
because I may have
found myself some news.

06:46.642 --> 06:50.301
- I got eyes on her. I got eyes on her!
- She's right in front of us.

06:50.336 --> 06:52.904
- Right.
- So, I know no one cares what I think,

06:52.972 --> 06:54.639
but I would just like to say,
first of all,

06:54.708 --> 06:56.240
I'm not convinced that you heard

06:56.309 --> 06:57.775
what you thought you heard
on that phone call.

06:57.844 --> 07:01.479
This lady may be just driving the turkey
to that sanctuary right now.

07:01.548 --> 07:03.347
I mean, you guys
aren't the best listeners.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.283
- You say something, Pop?
- And second of all,

07:05.351 --> 07:08.653
even if it is all true,
what, exactly, is our plan here, anyway?

07:08.722 --> 07:10.688
Run this lady off the road,
grab the turkey.

07:10.757 --> 07:12.490
- You know, standard stuff.
- (grunts)

07:12.559 --> 07:14.292
And then we got to
set Drew P. Neck free.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.661
Somewhere peaceful, on a hill,
with a turkey house

07:16.730 --> 07:17.962
and a white picket turkey fence.

07:18.031 --> 07:19.997
And water-efficient landscaping.

07:20.033 --> 07:22.333
BOB: <i>And we're getting on the highway.</i>

07:22.402 --> 07:24.435
<i>By the way, you're all hypocrites.</i>

07:24.504 --> 07:26.037
You know we're gonna eat
a turkey tomorrow, right?

07:26.106 --> 07:27.472
Eat the hell out of it.

07:27.507 --> 07:30.508
But, Dad, when we pardoned Drew P. Neck,
we promised him he'd live.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.310
We have to keep our word. I mean, what?

07:32.345 --> 07:33.878
We're gonna start lying to turkeys now?

07:33.947 --> 07:35.279
You think that's pretty cool, Dad?!

07:35.348 --> 07:36.781
♪ We're keeping our word ♪

07:36.850 --> 07:39.349
♪ We're saving the bird this year. ♪

07:39.393 --> 07:41.301
- BOB: Okay, I'm getting off.
- LINDA: What?

07:41.336 --> 07:42.987
- TINA: <i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>
- LOUISE: <i> Aw, come on!</i>

07:43.056 --> 07:44.956
We're going to the store
to get cranberries.

07:45.024 --> 07:47.024
Sometimes I get to do what I want to do.

07:47.060 --> 07:50.128
- No, you don't, ever!
- Pinch him, kids.

07:50.196 --> 07:51.529
(pained grunts)

07:51.598 --> 07:52.697
GENE: Let me at those nips.

07:52.766 --> 07:54.632
All right, fine.

07:54.701 --> 07:56.434
- (horn blaring)
- Ah...

07:57.537 --> 08:00.538
- (tires screeching)
- BOB: Oh, wonderful.

08:00.607 --> 08:01.572
TINA: Dad,
it's actually pretty dangerous

08:01.641 --> 08:02.874
to stop your car here.

08:02.942 --> 08:04.375
- BOB: <i>I know that, Tina!</i>
- LOUISE: <i> Wow.</i>

08:04.444 --> 08:06.244
<i>Did that whole family
give you the finger?</i>

08:06.312 --> 08:09.080
- Even the baby.
- Aw, little finger.

08:09.149 --> 08:10.748
LOUISE: <i>Well, we lost her.</i>

08:10.817 --> 08:13.885
- Great work, Cranberry Cathy.
- Oh, look, that's her car.

08:13.953 --> 08:15.052
Pull in, Dad.

08:17.590 --> 08:18.880
Well, now what?

08:18.959 --> 08:21.759
I think our only option is
to clock her over the head

08:21.828 --> 08:24.929
with a potted plant or a
tiny piano or something,

08:24.998 --> 08:26.330
and then grab the turkey.

08:26.399 --> 08:27.732
Maybe that could work.

08:27.801 --> 08:28.766
- Lin.
- What?

08:28.835 --> 08:29.901
Look, she's going inside.

08:29.969 --> 08:31.602
GENE: Just like she always does.

08:31.638 --> 08:33.938
If we had a brick, we could
throw it through the car window.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.073
- No.
- You're being very negative, Bob.

08:36.142 --> 08:38.042
No one is breaking into anything.

08:38.077 --> 08:41.846
We still don't even know if any of this
so-called conspiracy is even true.

08:41.914 --> 08:43.714
Now, I'm gonna go
into that little market

08:43.783 --> 08:46.551
and see if maybe, somehow,
they have cranberries.

08:46.619 --> 08:48.719
And then, when that lady
gets back to her car,

08:48.788 --> 08:50.188
we will talk to her.

08:50.256 --> 08:53.658
So, repeat after me: "I'm not going
to break into that vehicle."

08:53.726 --> 08:56.594
ALL: I'm not going
to break into that vehicle.

08:56.663 --> 08:58.196
I was hoping I would never have to

08:58.264 --> 09:01.265
force this family to say that,
but here we are.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.267
Cranberries? What do you want them for?

09:03.336 --> 09:05.603
To make cranberry
sauce for Thanksgiving.

09:05.672 --> 09:07.438
Cranberry sauce comes in a can.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.974
I mean, no, it comes from cranberries.

09:10.009 --> 09:11.876
But you can get it in a can, yes,

09:11.945 --> 09:13.911
if you're hollow inside
and your heart is dead.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.814
- Uh, we got raisins.
- Thanks for the help.

09:16.883 --> 09:19.050
WOMAN: Yes, I'll head over there
after I take the turkey to the

09:19.118 --> 09:20.318
(whispers): slaughterhouse.

09:20.386 --> 09:22.086
Yes, I was just going to the bathroom.

09:22.155 --> 09:23.588
I know I pee loud!

09:23.656 --> 09:26.791
Oh, my God, she is taking Drew P. Neck
to the slaughterhouse.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.826
Mm, don't know what you're saying now.

09:28.895 --> 09:30.661
Never mind, I got to go. Bye.

09:30.730 --> 09:33.865
Hey, what happened to the whole
not breaking into the vehicle thing?

09:33.933 --> 09:35.233
We're not breaking in, Bob.

09:35.301 --> 09:36.934
Yeah, Dad, it's the sunroof rule.

09:37.003 --> 09:39.770
"If it's open for sun,
it's open for fun."

09:39.839 --> 09:42.473
Oh, I can smell why she left it open.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.942
- More like "turd" is the word.
- (gobbles)

09:45.011 --> 09:46.644
Oh, God, I-I guess we're doing this.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.179
I guess we're saving this turkey.

09:48.248 --> 09:51.182
Attaboy, Bobby, you're finally
on the right side of history.

09:53.353 --> 09:54.952
Okay, let's get out of here.

09:55.021 --> 09:57.955
- (all gasp)
- Wait, is that the reporter guy?

09:58.024 --> 09:59.724
Ta-da! It's Ralph.

09:59.792 --> 10:02.260
I was in disguise as an
off-duty baseball player.

10:02.328 --> 10:04.595
- I almost hit you with my car.
- You sure did.

10:04.664 --> 10:06.631
Now, look, you kids
were right about this scandal,

10:06.666 --> 10:08.366
and now,
I've got the deputy mayor's aide

10:08.401 --> 10:09.700
talking about it on tape.

10:09.769 --> 10:11.769
- So, I owe you an apology.
- Mm-hmm.

10:11.838 --> 10:13.004
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah, you do.

10:13.072 --> 10:14.305
And you owe me one

10:14.374 --> 10:15.706
for not making me believe you.

10:15.742 --> 10:17.375
So, yeah, that's on you.

10:17.443 --> 10:19.377
Now, can I pop in there and
ride along with you guys?

10:19.412 --> 10:21.879
Get some quotes,
be embedded right in the S-word.

10:21.948 --> 10:23.214
- Okay.
- No, absolutely not.

10:23.249 --> 10:25.349
Yes. Come on, Bob, let him come.

10:25.418 --> 10:27.724
Think of the headline.
"Family Saves Pooping Mayor

10:27.754 --> 10:29.520
"from Actions of Poopy Deputy Mayor,

10:29.589 --> 10:31.622
Who is a Big Pile of Poops."
Right, Ralph?

10:31.691 --> 10:33.190
Huh, that's pretty good.
Let me write that down.

10:33.259 --> 10:34.392
(sighs) All right, fine.

10:34.427 --> 10:35.793
Just get in, and let's go.

10:35.828 --> 10:37.261
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.163
What the...
Ralph, what are you doing here?

10:39.198 --> 10:40.731
Wait, is-is that the...

10:40.800 --> 10:42.700
I'll tell you what I'm doing here,
Marsha.

10:42.769 --> 10:44.936
I'm exposing your scandalous lies.

10:44.971 --> 10:47.238
And by the way, I got 'em all on tape.

10:47.307 --> 10:48.572
Now, drive, Bob, drive!

10:48.608 --> 10:49.640
Is the back door shut?

10:49.709 --> 10:51.075
No, but it's fine. Go, Bob, go!

10:51.144 --> 10:52.510
Can you just shut it, please?

10:52.578 --> 10:54.245
I-I don't feel comfortable
driving with it open.

10:54.314 --> 10:55.346
Damn it, Bob! Drive!

10:55.415 --> 10:56.914
TINA: Also, this is our turkey.

10:56.983 --> 10:58.582
Yeah. James Van Der Beak.

10:58.618 --> 11:00.685
We're just trying to get
him back to his creek.

11:00.753 --> 11:04.155
- Okay, everybody just wait.
- RALPH: Drive!

11:04.223 --> 11:06.390
♪ ♪

11:06.426 --> 11:08.392
Oh, my God. She's coming after us.

11:08.461 --> 11:10.828
She's gonna kill us. She's gonna
kill us to cover this all up.

11:10.897 --> 11:12.096
That's what I would do.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.099
You got to lose her, Dad.

11:15.168 --> 11:16.667
I'm trying.

11:17.937 --> 11:19.103
Hold on, everybody!

11:20.340 --> 11:22.773
- Oh, crap!
- (screaming)

11:23.776 --> 11:25.276
(gobbling)

11:26.813 --> 11:28.946
Wow. Nice work back there, old man.

11:29.015 --> 11:30.715
Yeah, Bobby. That was hot.

11:30.783 --> 11:32.616
You're a regular Steve the Queen.

11:32.685 --> 11:34.051
It's Steve McQueen.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.454
- No, it's not.
- (turkey gobbles)

11:36.522 --> 11:38.689
You're welcome, you beady-eyed bastard.

11:38.758 --> 11:40.858
But this is just a job to me, you hear?

11:40.927 --> 11:42.893
- (gobbles)
- Don't sass me.

11:42.962 --> 11:45.563
(gasps) Look. That's where we
should set Drew P. Neck free.

11:45.631 --> 11:47.231
BOB: Uh, yeah. Let's do it.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.867
This car is never gonna
smell the same again.

11:49.936 --> 11:51.569
Eh, you'll get it back
to middle-aged fart smell

11:51.604 --> 11:53.304
- soon enough.
- Mm-hmm.

11:54.050 --> 11:56.591
Oh, God. So tired. So sweaty.

11:56.626 --> 11:58.442
That's what we'll put on your tombstone.

12:00.646 --> 12:03.080
Marsha! Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!

12:03.149 --> 12:04.448
All right, you know what?

12:04.517 --> 12:05.783
Why don't we just try talking to her?

12:05.852 --> 12:07.818
Oh, yeah, sure. That's a good plan.

12:07.887 --> 12:09.420
"Hey, I'm Bob. Can we talk?

12:09.489 --> 12:11.255
"Why are you putting those
black leather gloves on?

12:11.324 --> 12:13.557
"Oh, you're choking me!
You're choking me!

12:13.626 --> 12:15.993
(choking): Get off me! I'm dead."

12:16.062 --> 12:17.428
That could totally happen, Bob.

12:17.497 --> 12:18.929
I'm pretty sure Marsha has gloves.

12:18.965 --> 12:21.298
Okay, fine. Let's just go.

12:21.971 --> 12:23.434
TINA: Here. This is perfect.

12:23.503 --> 12:25.102
Oh, thank God.

12:26.639 --> 12:28.739
- Bye, bye, birdie.
- (panting) Stop!

12:28.808 --> 12:30.775
- Don't do this!
- Too late.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.977
Today, Drew Patrick Neck
is free as a bird.

12:33.046 --> 12:34.311
Please don't strangle us.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.180
- Huh?
- (yipping)

12:36.249 --> 12:38.282
What's that?

12:38.351 --> 12:40.785
Uh, guys,
I'm pretty sure that's coyotes.

12:40.853 --> 12:42.653
- (Linda gasps)
- Oh, my God.

12:47.038 --> 12:49.805
- (coyotes yipping)
- Okay, so, that's not gonna

12:49.874 --> 12:52.708
- be great for a turkey.
- No, not really.

12:52.777 --> 12:55.177
I guess it's in Mother
Nature's cruel hands now.

12:55.246 --> 12:56.679
Eh, Drew's fine.

12:56.747 --> 12:58.480
If Wile E. Coyote taught us anything,

12:58.549 --> 13:01.884
those rascals are blowing themselves up
with their own dynamite as we speak.

13:01.953 --> 13:04.153
- We got to go find him.
- Do we, though?

13:04.221 --> 13:06.655
Is it still a rescue story if
the rescuee is torn to shreds?

13:06.724 --> 13:08.190
I feel like it isn't.

13:08.259 --> 13:10.259
(sighs) Okay,
let's just go find the turkey,

13:10.294 --> 13:11.727
since that's what we do now.

13:11.796 --> 13:12.895
Okay, let's go.

13:12.964 --> 13:14.597
I mean, whatever. I'm breezy.

13:14.665 --> 13:16.231
Wait! Don't! You, um,

13:16.300 --> 13:18.534
you all dropped your wallets. Uh...

13:18.603 --> 13:20.569
I just have to say that you, madam,

13:20.638 --> 13:22.938
are not fit to wipe
the mayor's sick bottom.

13:23.007 --> 13:25.574
Not that getting some help
with wiping is a bad thing.

13:25.643 --> 13:29.545
And I still have your taped
conversation, Marsha. So, boom.

13:29.614 --> 13:31.747
Ralph, you cannot run this story.

13:31.816 --> 13:34.383
Oh, he's running the story, <i>Marsha.</i>

13:34.452 --> 13:36.018
That's right.
And there's not a single thing

13:36.087 --> 13:37.553
you can do about it.

13:37.622 --> 13:40.222
What about an exclusive
interview with the mayor?

13:40.291 --> 13:42.291
Well, that is something
that you could do about it.

13:42.326 --> 13:44.093
- I would like that.
- What? Ralph, no.

13:44.161 --> 13:46.462
How exclusive are we talking?
Super exclusive?

13:46.497 --> 13:48.397
Super duper exclusive.

13:48.466 --> 13:50.966
- Oh, wow.
- Ralph, if you run that story,

13:51.035 --> 13:54.370
we will give you free burgers
at our restaurant for a month.

13:54.438 --> 13:56.472
And also a free hot French fry massage,

13:56.507 --> 13:58.240
which is something
I've been workshopping,

13:58.309 --> 14:00.442
and it's going pretty well.

14:01.616 --> 14:03.371
- Dad.
- Yeah, Tina?

14:03.406 --> 14:05.080
Have you ever fought a
hungry pack of coyotes?

14:05.149 --> 14:06.815
- Um... No.
- Damn.

14:06.884 --> 14:09.218
What are you even supposed
to do when you see a coyote?

14:09.286 --> 14:11.220
Uh, I don't know.
I-I think you're supposed

14:11.288 --> 14:13.622
to use your body to scare it, maybe.

14:13.691 --> 14:15.257
You should probably
take off your shirt, then,

14:15.326 --> 14:16.592
and really freak him out.

14:16.627 --> 14:17.960
- Louise.
- What?

14:18.029 --> 14:19.361
(whispering): Look. Coyotes.

14:20.464 --> 14:21.897
(Tina gasps)

14:21.966 --> 14:23.298
Dad, go save him.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.668
Yeah. Um... Here I... Here I go.

14:25.736 --> 14:27.569
Okay. Go ahead.

14:27.605 --> 14:28.570
Yep. I'm going.

14:28.639 --> 14:30.472
Dad, you're not moving.

14:30.508 --> 14:33.175
Am, uh, am I not? That's weird,
I thought my legs were moving.

14:33.244 --> 14:34.977
- Would it helped if I pushed you?
- I-I don't...

14:35.046 --> 14:36.278
- I don't think so, Tina.
- (grunting)

14:36.347 --> 14:37.479
Uh, Tina, stop. Don't push me.

14:37.548 --> 14:39.248
Guys, he's just a dumb turkey.

14:39.316 --> 14:42.317
He's not worth getting
maimed or coyote-uglied over.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.499
This is the law of the woods.

14:44.534 --> 14:45.988
I mean, coyotes have to eat...

14:46.057 --> 14:47.990
Oh, my God! What am I saying?
Get the hell away

14:48.059 --> 14:50.592
from Drew P. Neck, you sons of bitches!

14:50.661 --> 14:51.860
- (screaming)
- No, Louise!

14:51.929 --> 14:54.842
(panting) Whoa. Louise.

14:54.877 --> 14:55.464
(panting)

14:55.533 --> 14:57.666
I-I guess you got that one.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.435
- (panting)
- Uh, I'll get the next turkey

14:59.503 --> 15:01.203
that's being attacked by coyotes.

15:01.272 --> 15:02.838
- Sure.
- But that was good, though.

15:02.907 --> 15:05.607
It was actually what...
exactly what I was gonna do.

15:06.471 --> 15:07.209
MARSHA: Great. You found him.

15:07.278 --> 15:10.045
That's... That's what we wanted.
(chuckles)

15:10.114 --> 15:13.682
So, uh, Ralph, uh, super duper
exclusive interview with the mayor?

15:13.751 --> 15:15.617
- Be strong, Ralph.
- Sorry, Marsha.

15:15.686 --> 15:17.119
- No deal.
- Yes!

15:17.188 --> 15:18.721
A "turkey pardon cover-up,"

15:18.789 --> 15:22.353
plus "little girl saves turkey
from a pack of coyotes"?

15:22.388 --> 15:23.726
That's what we call
in the journalism biz

15:23.794 --> 15:25.828
a "Scoop There It Is."

15:25.896 --> 15:27.196
Plus this lady right
here offered me a month

15:27.264 --> 15:29.131
- of free burgers, so...
- Excuse me?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.999
- Bob, shush, shush, shush.
- MARSHA: Well, great.

15:31.068 --> 15:32.801
This cover-up is going just great.

15:32.870 --> 15:34.870
Oh, I'm a terrible cover-upper.

15:34.939 --> 15:36.338
Aw. No.

15:36.407 --> 15:38.974
- No, I am. I am.
- I mean, yeah.

15:39.043 --> 15:40.409
So, I have a question.

15:40.478 --> 15:42.495
What are we gonna do
with this turkey now?

15:42.530 --> 15:44.446
Actually, I have an idea.

15:47.818 --> 15:50.586
It's me. Marsha. From work.

15:52.588 --> 15:53.322
BOB: Is this it?

15:53.357 --> 15:55.691
Wait a second.
Is that a two-butted goat?

15:55.760 --> 15:59.561
- LOUISE: Sure is.
- GENE: A butt so nice, he has one twice.

15:59.630 --> 16:02.531
- (screaming)
- I really don't like when people do that.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.999
LOUISE: Deputy Mayor Cunningham?

16:04.068 --> 16:05.987
Okay, now we're gonna get murdered.

16:08.682 --> 16:11.241
Oh, my God. Okay, okay.

16:11.310 --> 16:12.776
Everybody, uh, just play dead

16:12.845 --> 16:15.312
and maybe he'll go away.
Like this. (groans)

16:15.380 --> 16:17.647
Um, hello? Deputy Mayor Cunningham here.

16:17.716 --> 16:19.716
Just want to say, not gonna murder you,

16:19.785 --> 16:21.651
'cause... not in this suit. (laughs)

16:21.720 --> 16:23.753
Uh, h-how did you know
we were coming here?

16:23.789 --> 16:24.888
Hi.

16:24.957 --> 16:26.656
Marsha! You told him.

16:26.725 --> 16:28.458
But how did you know
we were coming here?

16:28.527 --> 16:30.093
'Cause you talked about
it right in front of me.

16:30.162 --> 16:31.461
Oh, yeah. We did.

16:31.530 --> 16:32.996
You told us how to get to route five.

16:33.065 --> 16:34.798
- Yeah.
- Thanks again. Good directions.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.433
- You're welcome.
- TINA: Don't try to stop us,

16:36.501 --> 16:38.301
Deputy Mayor Man.
We're giving Drew P. Neck

16:38.370 --> 16:40.103
to this farm to live
out his days peacefully.

16:40.172 --> 16:41.938
Yeah. He's gonna live with Double Butt.

16:42.007 --> 16:43.974
It's gonna be like that
show <i>Three's Company,</i>

16:44.042 --> 16:45.609
- but with butts.
- Oh, I'm falling.

16:45.677 --> 16:47.244
Sorry, but the farmer's not home.

16:47.312 --> 16:48.478
He must be out night-farming.

16:48.513 --> 16:49.946
- Crap.
- Damn it. - Nice.

16:50.015 --> 16:51.448
It's over, Cunningham.

16:51.516 --> 16:53.783
I'm turning in my story,
and you are about to be

16:53.852 --> 16:55.919
the deputy mayor of your mom's house.

16:55.988 --> 16:57.921
Ooh. So sorry, Ralph.

16:57.956 --> 16:59.856
You see, you recorded
a private conversation

16:59.925 --> 17:01.524
without Marsha's permission.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.094
So unless you want to get sued,
you're gonna need that.

17:04.162 --> 17:06.088
Damn it. I do hate getting sued.

17:06.123 --> 17:07.130
Yeah. It's not fun.

17:07.199 --> 17:08.665
So how about I just take
that turkey off your hands?

17:08.733 --> 17:09.866
- No.
- (grunting)

17:09.935 --> 17:11.101
Pinch posse, attack!

17:11.169 --> 17:12.636
Ow.

17:12.704 --> 17:13.837
- Kids, stop it.
- Get him!

17:13.906 --> 17:15.704
- That is my nipple.
- GENE: Just a few more hours

17:15.773 --> 17:17.140
of this and you'll be dead.

17:17.568 --> 17:19.709
Now. Good evening, everyone.

17:19.778 --> 17:22.178
And may God bless America.

17:22.247 --> 17:23.512
Marsha, skedaddle. Go, go, go.

17:23.582 --> 17:25.348
Wait, Marsha. Stop.

17:25.416 --> 17:28.550
Look, today has been awful
for many reasons.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.187
We could've had a great
afternoon buying cranberries,

17:31.256 --> 17:33.690
but instead we did this.

17:33.759 --> 17:35.992
And the worst part of it is,
I really don't want

17:36.061 --> 17:37.994
my kids to think this is
how the world works.

17:38.063 --> 17:39.829
That people don't keep their word.

17:39.898 --> 17:41.798
Even if it is to turkeys.

17:41.867 --> 17:43.833
So please, do the right thing.

17:43.902 --> 17:45.869
Also, your job seems horrible.

17:45.938 --> 17:47.404
I'm just saying, I'm not judging.

17:47.472 --> 17:51.174
Well, too bad Marsha doesn't give a rip.

17:51.243 --> 17:53.410
Mom, I'll be there in a few hours.

17:53.478 --> 17:55.345
And by the way, I'm quitting.

17:55.380 --> 17:57.414
- All right.
- Yes. - Yeah, Marsha!

17:57.482 --> 18:00.517
- But, but...
- Oh, uh, she wants to talk to you...?

18:00.585 --> 18:02.552
I don't want to... (sighs) Hello?

18:02.621 --> 18:06.222
Hey, now. Okay, there's no
need for that kind of langua...

18:06.291 --> 18:07.891
I will not go to hell.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.826
I am going to heaven. Good day.

18:10.531 --> 18:12.228
What's going on? What'd I miss?

18:12.297 --> 18:15.098
I got lost in the damn corn maze again.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.701
Oh! Hey, kids. I remember you.

18:17.769 --> 18:21.104
Hello, Mr. Farmer. We'd like to
present you with this turkey.

18:21.173 --> 18:23.740
Oh, to eat? Thanks. Okay, bye.

18:23.809 --> 18:25.775
Oh, no.
We were thinking you could, like,

18:25.844 --> 18:28.411
raise it as your pet, or your child.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.246
Yeah, we know he only has one butt,

18:30.315 --> 18:32.082
but maybe you can make an exception?

18:32.150 --> 18:34.451
Oh, uh... Yeah. Sure.

18:34.519 --> 18:36.720
Um, to be clear...
you're not gonna eat him, right?

18:36.788 --> 18:39.122
'Cause we went to a
lot of trouble and...

18:39.191 --> 18:41.257
Yeah, yeah. Got it.
I won't eat him. Sheesh.

18:41.326 --> 18:42.892
So can we go home now?

18:42.928 --> 18:45.128
Ugh. You love going home.

18:45.197 --> 18:47.630
I call way back. I'm gonna start
typing out my story on my phone.

18:47.699 --> 18:49.199
Hey, Bob. Can you do me a favor

18:49.267 --> 18:50.633
and just drive a little
bit better this time?

18:50.702 --> 18:52.469
What? We were in a high-speed chase.

18:52.537 --> 18:53.937
Yeah, I know. There's just a lot

18:54.006 --> 18:55.372
of zigging and zagging
all over the place.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.773
If you could just smooth it out for me.

18:56.842 --> 18:58.637
- (groans)
- Hey. Ralph.

18:58.672 --> 18:59.943
How do you now they'll print it?

19:00.012 --> 19:02.545
What's that? My story?
Well, they have a printer, so...

19:02.614 --> 19:05.782
Yeah, yeah.
But how do you know they'll print it?

19:05.817 --> 19:07.417
I think he's trying to say, Ralph,

19:07.486 --> 19:09.386
that he has some way
of killing your story.

19:09.454 --> 19:11.087
Um, that's what I'm picking up.

19:11.156 --> 19:13.556
No, I think he's just interested
in the printing process.

19:13.625 --> 19:17.627
No, you... Let me put it this way:
I am the deputy mayor.

19:17.696 --> 19:20.797
When I say "kill a story,"
they say, "how high?"

19:20.866 --> 19:26.236
This story is officially D-E-A...

19:26.304 --> 19:28.071
- Oh, they printed it.
- Huh. I guess Cunningham

19:28.140 --> 19:30.273
doesn't have as much pull at
the paper as he thought he did.

19:30.342 --> 19:32.609
Yeah, he's not the mayor.
He's the deputy.

19:32.677 --> 19:34.477
They even let dogs be deputies.

19:34.513 --> 19:36.946
This is so exciting.
I mean, it's on page 11

19:37.015 --> 19:39.282
and Ralph spelled our name
"Blecher," but still.

19:39.351 --> 19:41.751
I've never figured out
how the heck it's spelled.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.353
We did good. Thanksgiving?

19:43.422 --> 19:46.356
More like You're Welcome-ivigiving.

19:46.425 --> 19:47.824
Dad, this cranberry sauce looks great.

19:47.893 --> 19:49.826
I don't even miss the can shape, much.

19:49.895 --> 19:52.162
I just can't believe that
farmer had a cranberry bog.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.130
And he let me in that cranberry bog.

19:54.199 --> 19:56.299
But I mean, I played it pretty cool.

19:56.368 --> 20:00.036
They're so fresh! They're so fresh!

20:00.105 --> 20:01.971
Okay, okay. Chill out.

20:02.040 --> 20:05.809
All right. Time for one of my
famous Thanksgiving speeches.

20:05.877 --> 20:08.126
Hold on.
I wrote something down this year.

20:08.161 --> 20:09.679
Uh, "You know, when I was growing up..."

20:09.703 --> 20:11.014
- Dad. Uh, Dad?
- Huh?

20:11.083 --> 20:13.450
- Yeah.
- I'd like the floor, if I may.

20:13.518 --> 20:15.718
- Um, uh, just... uh, yeah.
- You're done, right?

20:15.787 --> 20:17.153
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, great.

20:17.222 --> 20:19.022
I was just gonna put this away. Yeah.

20:19.091 --> 20:21.624
I used to think turkeys
were nasty and horrible.

20:21.693 --> 20:23.460
But then I-I met someone

20:23.528 --> 20:25.895
that taught me that
maybe they're not so bad.

20:25.964 --> 20:27.931
- Was that someone me? Oh.
- No.

20:27.966 --> 20:30.333
It was Drew P. Neck.
And so, on behalf of him,

20:30.402 --> 20:33.203
I'd like to pardon
this turkey right now.

20:33.271 --> 20:34.971
Aw, that's so sweet.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.073
- I know.
- Um, it's already dead.

20:37.142 --> 20:38.575
- Quiet, Bob.
- Sorry.

20:38.643 --> 20:40.376
Okay, everybody, let's dig in.

20:40.445 --> 20:42.412
I'm gonna pardon that
fool right into my mouth.

20:42.447 --> 20:44.581
It's just not how pardoning works.

20:44.649 --> 20:47.517
Pardon me while I pardon gravy
all up in this mamma-jamma.

20:47.586 --> 20:49.419
<i>And get a little onto my knees,</i>

20:49.488 --> 20:51.754
<i>and a little bit all over my neck.</i>

20:51.823 --> 20:53.490
- BOB: <i>Stop, Gene.</i>
- LINDA: <i> And I'm gonna pardon</i>

20:53.558 --> 20:55.325
<i>the cork right out of this Pardonnay.</i>

20:55.393 --> 20:57.560
