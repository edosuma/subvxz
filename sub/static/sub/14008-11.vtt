00:02.735 --> 00:04.038
Previously on "Damages"...

00:04.074 --> 00:05.348
Frobisher had my fiancÃ© killed.

00:05.415 --> 00:07.863
This is a tremendous book.

00:07.930 --> 00:10.427
Let me option this, and I want to play you.

00:10.494 --> 00:13.329
Louis Tobin had to start moving the money down there before he confessed.

00:13.397 --> 00:16.698
And on Thanksgiving night, Tessa started moving it out.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.834
Patty Hewes asked you about Thanksgiving night?

00:18.901 --> 00:21.036
I appreciated you not talking to her about it.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.304
We are not going to approach Tessa Marchetti now.

00:23.372 --> 00:24.772
What are you talking about?

00:24.840 --> 00:25.807
We've got no leverage.

00:25.874 --> 00:27.707
I don't need you or your protection.

00:27.775 --> 00:29.241
I shouldn't have approached Tessa.

00:29.309 --> 00:29.975
I'll tell Patty.

00:30.043 --> 00:32.043
And if she finds out, blame it on me.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.946
Ellen Parsons, she's been talking to Patty Hewes.

00:35.014 --> 00:38.347
The truth is, we do believe the Tobins were involved in your mother's death.

00:38.415 --> 00:39.381
What should I do?

00:39.449 --> 00:40.215
Call this number.

00:40.283 --> 00:41.550
This is Tessa Marchetti.

00:41.617 --> 00:43.518
I'm just a couple blocks away from your office.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.887
You're under arrest.

00:45.955 --> 00:47.789
Do you know who that is?

00:47.857 --> 00:49.257
She babysat for you and Carrie.

00:49.325 --> 00:51.793
When we were kids, you used to tell me I was adopted.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.194
Her name's Anne Connel.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.061
All I could get was an address.

00:54.129 --> 00:57.165
It's about a hundred miles outside of the city.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.510 --> 01:34.380
Can I help you?

01:34.448 --> 01:37.784
Ms. Connel?

01:37.852 --> 01:41.989
I'm sorry to bother you, um... my name's Ellen Parsons.

01:42.057 --> 01:44.726
Yes?

01:44.794 --> 01:47.796
Do you remember me?

01:47.864 --> 01:51.700
Ellen?

02:36.946 --> 02:41.116
Curtis Gates arrested Tessa Marchetti.

02:41.184 --> 02:42.551
For what?

02:42.619 --> 02:43.786
I have no idea.

02:43.854 --> 02:45.554
That's why she never showed up here.

02:45.622 --> 02:48.591
So Gates just happened to arrest her right when she

02:48.659 --> 02:50.426
was coming to talk to us?

02:50.494 --> 02:51.661
Looks like it.

02:51.728 --> 02:54.263
How the hell would he know to do that?

02:54.331 --> 02:57.365
I have no idea.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.132
Why am I under arrest?

02:59.201 --> 03:00.868
Because of your boyfriend.

03:00.936 --> 03:01.701
What?

03:01.769 --> 03:04.004
He's a citizen of Antigua.

03:04.072 --> 03:05.171
So?

03:05.239 --> 03:09.241
He's been living here in New York for the last three months on an expired visa.

03:09.309 --> 03:11.177
Well, how is that my fault?

03:11.244 --> 03:16.515
Well, he entered the country with you and he lives in your apartment.

03:16.582 --> 03:19.818
It's a crime to house an illegal alien, Ms. Marchetti.

03:19.885 --> 03:22.054
Look, he's going to get it renewed.

03:22.122 --> 03:23.423
I didn't do anything.

03:23.491 --> 03:24.657
You can't arrest me for this.

03:24.725 --> 03:26.625
Well, I'm sorry, but I can.

03:26.693 --> 03:28.894
I want to talk to a lawyer.

03:28.962 --> 03:29.995
Of course.

03:30.063 --> 03:32.465
I think you should.

03:32.532 --> 03:36.034
Any lawyer in particular?

03:36.102 --> 03:40.304
Tessa Marchetti wants Patty Hewes to be her lawyer.

03:40.372 --> 03:42.139
Arresting Tessa was the right move.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.638
Yeah, I should thank you.

03:43.706 --> 03:45.236
We would've missed this opportunity if you hadn't told

03:45.304 --> 03:47.635
me that Patty was working with Ellen behind my back.

03:47.703 --> 03:49.535
Just doing my job.

03:49.602 --> 03:55.302
Hey... you're not going to fire Ellen, are you?

03:55.370 --> 04:00.273
As soon as she comes back from wherever the hell she is, send her to my office.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.241
Thank you.

04:03.309 --> 04:07.314
Mm-hmm.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.589
Why did you decide to find me?

04:17.658 --> 04:20.492
I had a dream about you, actually.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.861
Um, did you ever cook for me?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.129
Many times.

04:25.197 --> 04:28.832
So, you say you're an attorney now?

04:28.900 --> 04:29.699
Yes.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.735
I'm glad things worked out so well.

04:32.803 --> 04:34.804
I was always worried about you.

04:34.871 --> 04:37.072
Why's that?

04:37.140 --> 04:42.076
And I was very sorry when I had to let you go.

04:42.143 --> 04:42.910
Let me go?

04:42.977 --> 04:47.145
What... what... what does that mean?

04:47.213 --> 04:49.347
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.182
No. It's okay.

04:51.250 --> 04:56.021
I... I... I want you to tell me.

04:56.088 --> 05:00.424
Ms. Connel, were you...?

05:00.492 --> 05:09.570
This is a very strange question, but, um... was I adopted?

05:09.638 --> 05:16.409
I'm not your mother, Ellen, if that's what you were thinking.

05:16.477 --> 05:19.378
But I did... I lived with you at some point?

05:19.446 --> 05:20.880
Oh, dear.

05:20.948 --> 05:22.582
No one ever told you?

05:22.650 --> 05:25.284
My mother just said that you were our babysitter.

05:25.352 --> 05:26.719
Yes, I was.

05:26.786 --> 05:28.287
When you were four or five.

05:28.354 --> 05:31.356
And that was all it was?

05:31.424 --> 05:37.928
Ellen, things in your home were bad when you were young.

05:37.996 --> 05:39.796
Bad how?

05:39.864 --> 05:42.331
I never really knew all the details, but your father

05:42.399 --> 05:45.434
was very unhappy, very angry.

05:45.501 --> 05:48.669
I always thought your mother should've left him, but with two

05:48.737 --> 05:53.439
small girls, she was scared to be on her own.

05:53.506 --> 06:00.712
She couldn't handle you and your sister.

06:00.780 --> 06:04.415
So she... sent me to you?

06:04.482 --> 06:08.217
You were happy at my house.

06:08.285 --> 06:12.555
Your mother knew that.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.991
Uh, how long did it last?

06:16.058 --> 06:20.260
You lived with me maybe six months.

06:20.328 --> 06:28.969
And then, one day your mother asked... if I was interested...

06:29.037 --> 06:34.974
In making the arrangement permanent.

06:35.042 --> 06:39.843
Your parents didn't adopt you.

06:39.911 --> 06:42.612
It was the other way around.

06:42.679 --> 06:44.913
I don't understand.

06:44.981 --> 06:51.483
Your mother asked me to adopt you.

06:51.551 --> 06:54.052
And what did you say?

06:54.120 --> 06:56.587
I said "yes."

06:56.655 --> 07:00.690
I adored you.

07:00.758 --> 07:04.759
But your mother decided she couldn't go through with it.

07:04.827 --> 07:08.395
So, she brought you home.

07:08.463 --> 07:14.265
And after that, she didn't want you to see me again.

07:14.332 --> 07:18.334
I understood.

07:22.271 --> 07:25.973
Your mother loved you, Ellen.

07:26.041 --> 07:31.043
She did the best she could.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.247
I talked to my client.

07:37.315 --> 07:39.417
You have nothing on Tessa Marchetti.

07:39.485 --> 07:41.454
You're holding her on a technicality.

07:41.522 --> 07:44.093
So, what's your point?

07:44.162 --> 07:47.536
I thought you didn't detain people without cause.

07:47.604 --> 07:52.345
Yeah, well... If I've learned one thing on this job, it's to remain flexible.

07:52.413 --> 07:55.083
Tessa is the key to my case right now.

07:55.151 --> 07:58.186
I need her to find the Tobins' money.

07:58.254 --> 08:00.388
Uh-huh, well, she's in my custody.

08:00.456 --> 08:03.390
Sooner or later you're going to have to let her go.

08:03.458 --> 08:04.091
That's true.

08:04.159 --> 08:09.328
And you can wait for that eventuality, but I doubt you have the time.

08:09.396 --> 08:12.398
So, why don't you just give me what I want?

08:12.465 --> 08:14.466
Which is?

08:14.534 --> 08:16.868
You've been working behind my back with Ellen

08:16.936 --> 08:23.173
Parsons on Danielle Marchetti's murder.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.542
I want evidence.

08:25.610 --> 08:31.080
I'm not ready to make a deal.

08:44.325 --> 08:46.059
Hey, it's Tom.

08:46.127 --> 08:49.696
Look, I'm sorry I screwed up, but your boss arrested Tessa

08:49.763 --> 08:51.897
Marchetti and the shit hit the fan.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.700
I've never seen Patty like this.

08:54.768 --> 08:59.370
Where are you?

09:05.143 --> 09:07.478
Hello, Ellen.

09:07.545 --> 09:10.580
I left messages.

09:10.647 --> 09:12.948
Why haven't you called me back?

09:28.361 --> 09:31.363
Leave it.

09:46.177 --> 09:53.382
How did Gates know you were helping me on the case?

09:53.450 --> 09:56.551
I'm sorry.

09:56.619 --> 09:58.253
It was my fault.

09:58.320 --> 10:05.358
Because as soon as he found out... Gates went straight to Tessa

10:05.426 --> 10:09.662
Marchetti and arrested her.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.330
I approached Tessa.

10:11.398 --> 10:14.966
I thought that I could get her to cooperate, and then the whole

10:15.034 --> 10:18.202
thing blew up in my face.

10:18.270 --> 10:21.305
It was a mistake.

10:21.373 --> 10:25.408
A mistake?

10:25.476 --> 10:29.645
Was it?

10:29.713 --> 10:34.016
Or have you been trying to humiliate me this whole time?

10:34.083 --> 10:35.984
What?

10:36.052 --> 10:39.453
Pretending to help me.

10:39.521 --> 10:47.126
When what you really wanted was to get close to Gates.

10:47.194 --> 10:49.128
No.

10:49.196 --> 10:51.797
You used me.

10:51.865 --> 10:57.969
'Cause it's always been about ambition with you.

10:58.036 --> 11:01.939
You act like you care about the case.

11:02.007 --> 11:07.677
All that... crap... about your family.

11:07.745 --> 11:11.480
Your sister's wedding.

11:11.548 --> 11:16.718
I fell for your bullshit.

11:16.785 --> 11:19.553
But I know you now.

11:19.621 --> 11:22.689
I see you.

11:22.757 --> 11:26.125
You're a climber.

11:26.193 --> 11:30.863
A parasite.

11:30.930 --> 11:34.933
And you're ruthless.

11:40.872 --> 11:45.208
Just... go.

11:45.276 --> 11:49.979
I want you out of my apartment.

11:50.046 --> 11:54.049
I want you out of my life.

12:23.847 --> 12:25.881
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.

12:25.948 --> 12:27.048
Yeah, I'm well aware.

12:27.116 --> 12:32.920
So, you considered your company sort of like a family, didn't you?

12:32.988 --> 12:34.621
Very much like a family.

12:34.689 --> 12:39.590
And was it your job to hold the family together?

12:39.658 --> 12:43.059
Yes. It was.

12:43.127 --> 12:44.794
And you failed.

12:44.861 --> 12:46.128
Objection.

12:46.195 --> 12:47.796
I'm warning you, counsel.

12:47.863 --> 12:49.363
I'll rephrase.

12:49.431 --> 12:51.564
Was it very painful for you when you failed?

12:51.632 --> 12:52.398
Objection.

12:52.466 --> 12:55.968
You keep this up and we're going to have ourselves a problem.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.069
Would you agree the crumbling of that relationship

12:58.137 --> 13:03.640
was nothing less than, really say, the dissolution of a marriage?

13:03.707 --> 13:06.075
You better watch what you say.

13:06.142 --> 13:07.242
Is that your position?

13:07.310 --> 13:11.279
Or was the failure of that relationship, as you call it,

13:11.347 --> 13:12.280
your failure?

13:12.347 --> 13:20.591
Your deceit, your breach of trust, your absolute infidelity to your employees?

13:23.528 --> 13:28.063
I admire you, Ms. Hewes, I really do.

13:28.130 --> 13:29.964
But we're very different.

13:30.032 --> 13:31.365
Is that so?

13:31.433 --> 13:36.836
You've made a career out of crushing people who stand in your way.

13:36.904 --> 13:43.243
And whereas you seek to destroy, I seek to create.

13:43.311 --> 13:49.784
I've always felt it was my duty to inspire the people who work for me.

13:49.851 --> 13:55.923
So that together... together... we can build

13:55.991 --> 13:59.827
something remarkable.

13:59.894 --> 14:01.595
What did you think?

14:01.596 --> 14:04.564
It is such a huge help to hear this thing out loud.

14:04.632 --> 14:08.401
We're still, you know, doing some fine-tuning, but it's...

14:08.469 --> 14:09.602
Something's wrong.

14:09.669 --> 14:10.669
Reading great.

14:10.737 --> 14:13.705
Arthur, do you, um, do you not think the script's working?

14:13.773 --> 14:15.373
There's something off, you know?

14:15.441 --> 14:16.274
Something's missing.

14:16.342 --> 14:16.941
Yeah?

14:17.009 --> 14:18.676
I don't know the protocol.

14:18.744 --> 14:19.343
Can I...?

14:19.411 --> 14:20.144
Oh, by all means.

14:20.211 --> 14:23.045
Tell them whatever you want.

14:25.048 --> 14:29.285
Listen... Hey, that was great, by the way.

14:29.352 --> 14:34.222
Now, listen to m this is Patty Hewes you're playing.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.457
The kind of woman who eats her young.

14:36.525 --> 14:38.826
I mean, when she looks across the table at the Frobisher

14:38.894 --> 14:46.332
character... She is pure, unadulterated evil.

14:46.366 --> 14:48.667
Okay?

14:48.735 --> 14:50.502
Yeah.

14:50.570 --> 14:52.338
Okay.

14:52.405 --> 14:55.974
And you... Jesus, it's uncanny.

14:56.041 --> 15:00.345
It's like... it's like seeing a ghost.

15:00.412 --> 15:04.647
I want to tell you something though.

15:04.715 --> 15:07.082
Ray Fiske was gay.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.983
Oki?

15:09.051 --> 15:12.386
Toss that in and play with it a little bit, all right?

15:12.453 --> 15:13.754
And no makeup next time.

15:13.821 --> 15:17.457
It's just a workshop.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.893
Okay, uh... I can't tell you how sexy you are.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.462
Let's take it from the top.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.565
Whenever you're ready.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.534
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.

15:27.602 --> 15:30.304
I'm well aware.

15:30.372 --> 15:35.108
Do me a favor, will you, Toby, and grab us a couple of coffees?

15:35.176 --> 15:40.714
You can finish the shoes later.

15:40.782 --> 15:42.683
Tessa Marchetti's in custody.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.885
Custody of who?

15:44.952 --> 15:46.753
The D.A.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.789
They got her on what charge?

15:48.856 --> 15:50.924
It's unclear.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.559
God!

15:52.627 --> 15:54.561
Using a 24-year-old girl as a courier?

15:54.629 --> 15:56.730
Was that the best idea my father could come up with?

15:56.797 --> 15:58.431
He had to scramble, Joe.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.133
Why didn't he have a goddamn plan?

16:00.201 --> 16:00.934
He did.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.635
Of course he did.

16:02.703 --> 16:05.172
But the government surprised him and they started to move in

16:05.239 --> 16:10.645
too quickly, and... We were forced to improvise.

16:13.049 --> 16:15.751
I brought these, Lou.

16:15.819 --> 16:18.321
You wanted the heels fixed on your boots.

16:18.388 --> 16:21.222
They're going to get me, Stu.

16:21.290 --> 16:25.489
I can't hide it anymore.

16:25.557 --> 16:27.523
It's okay.

16:27.590 --> 16:30.692
She knows about the fraud.

16:30.760 --> 16:35.163
You met with the sec?

16:35.230 --> 16:37.665
Yeah.

16:37.733 --> 16:41.536
It's only a matter of time before they put two and two together.

16:41.603 --> 16:43.504
Jesus.

16:44.707 --> 16:47.909
Louis, are you okay?

16:47.976 --> 16:49.711
Do you have your pills?

16:49.778 --> 16:52.513
Sweetheart, get me a glass of water, please?

16:52.581 --> 16:55.416
Okay. Yes.

16:55.484 --> 16:58.553
I'm going to tell my family tonight.

16:58.620 --> 17:04.858
And then I'm going to turn myself in.

17:04.925 --> 17:11.130
It'll be easier on the family if I just... get it over with.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.098
Are you ready on your end?

17:13.165 --> 17:18.869
Everything's set with the charity, but... Here you go.

17:18.936 --> 17:21.338
Thanks, Dani.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.040
Give us a minute.

17:24.108 --> 17:28.746
Yeah, of course.

17:28.813 --> 17:32.316
We've got to start making those transfers tonight.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.184
Lou, this is happening too fast.

17:34.252 --> 17:36.086
We don't have a courier yet.

17:36.154 --> 17:41.725
How soon can Emanuel authorize a signatory for the account?

17:41.793 --> 17:42.960
As soon as you need.

17:43.027 --> 17:43.961
That's not a problem.

17:44.028 --> 17:47.231
But who are you going to use?

17:47.298 --> 17:52.235
I don't like doing this.

17:52.303 --> 17:55.872
But there is someone we can trust.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.674
He chose Tessa?

17:57.742 --> 18:00.076
Tessa was his daughter.

18:00.144 --> 18:01.378
Of course he trusted her.

18:01.446 --> 18:03.613
How much does she know?

18:03.681 --> 18:05.782
Only that she was depositing paychecks.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.817
What about the documents she signed?

18:07.885 --> 18:09.619
She know where the money was going?

18:09.687 --> 18:10.287
Absolutely not.

18:10.354 --> 18:11.922
She never knew what she was signing.

18:11.989 --> 18:13.723
So there's nothing she can tell the authorities.

18:13.791 --> 18:15.625
And you're sure of that, how?

18:15.693 --> 18:18.295
Because your father was smart and careful.

18:18.362 --> 18:19.796
Smart? He got caught.

18:19.864 --> 18:20.997
Okay?

18:21.065 --> 18:22.933
I'm not going to let that happen to us.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.334
Tessa was always loyal to him.

18:24.402 --> 18:26.136
Doesn't mean she's going to be loyal to me.

18:26.203 --> 18:27.604
Listen to what I'm telling you.

18:27.672 --> 18:30.807
Tessa Marchetti doesn't know anything and she's on your side.

18:30.875 --> 18:35.946
So calm down and don't get paranoid.

18:41.852 --> 18:42.852
Four?

18:42.920 --> 18:47.957
- Four people... in the corner... - Arthur, Terry's ready for you.

18:51.028 --> 18:53.796
Oh, my God.

18:53.864 --> 18:58.701
Man, if I knew I was this good-looking, I would've tried a different line of work.

18:58.769 --> 19:00.904
Actually, can you give us a minute?

19:00.971 --> 19:01.971
Yeah, everything okay?

19:02.039 --> 19:03.840
Yeah, I just want to talk to Art.

19:03.908 --> 19:06.976
Sure. Take your time.

19:07.044 --> 19:08.044
Fantastic.

19:08.112 --> 19:09.779
Really, really.

19:09.847 --> 19:13.950
Just remarkable, man.

19:14.018 --> 19:16.953
It's not working, Art.

19:17.021 --> 19:19.622
What... what's not working?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.257
Any of it.

19:21.325 --> 19:25.094
I mean, the hair and the clothes are fine.

19:25.162 --> 19:29.498
What's the problem then?

19:29.566 --> 19:31.700
None of it feels authentic.

19:31.768 --> 19:35.037
You know, it feels too on the surface.

19:35.105 --> 19:41.777
I need to be able to go inside you and figure out what drives you.

19:41.845 --> 19:45.981
That's the only way I can truly find the part.

19:46.049 --> 19:47.149
That sounds great.

19:47.216 --> 19:48.250
Do it.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.852
No, you don't get it.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.690
See, when we were workshopping the depositions... No, but that's

19:54.757 --> 19:56.024
going to be a great goddamn scene.

19:56.092 --> 19:58.593
Now, once we get a, you know, a top-flight actress in

19:58.661 --> 19:59.894
there... elevate the whole thing.

19:59.962 --> 20:00.762
Really.

20:00.829 --> 20:05.031
Could be a great scene... but it's dishonest.

20:05.099 --> 20:06.700
What do you mean by that?

20:06.767 --> 20:09.068
Why... why is it dishonest?

20:09.136 --> 20:11.203
I read the stenographer's transcription

20:11.271 --> 20:13.338
from your actual deposition.

20:13.406 --> 20:16.373
Now, I don't know what you told the screenwriter, but you never

20:16.441 --> 20:18.842
waxed philosophical with Patty.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.211
You went ballistic.

20:20.279 --> 20:22.281
- All right, but... - No, it was great!

20:22.349 --> 20:23.317
It was terrific!

20:23.385 --> 20:24.453
It was uncensored!

20:24.521 --> 20:26.089
It was unfiltered!

20:26.157 --> 20:29.993
That's what I need to get in touch with.

20:30.061 --> 20:32.062
My anger?

20:32.130 --> 20:33.964
Your dark side.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.600
I need access to it.

20:36.668 --> 20:42.339
Otherwise, this is just candy coating.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.308
You are a complicated man.

20:44.375 --> 20:50.614
You have an underbelly that most people never get to see.

20:50.681 --> 20:52.415
Of course.

20:52.483 --> 20:58.521
I have to be able to see it.

20:58.589 --> 21:01.457
All right, all right.

21:01.525 --> 21:07.663
We'll just, uh, have to show you my... my underbelly then.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.406
What is this?

21:17.474 --> 21:19.709
What you need to arrest Carol Tobin for Danielle.

21:19.776 --> 21:21.277
Marchetti's murder.

21:21.344 --> 21:22.478
Thank you, Patty.

21:22.545 --> 21:24.813
Uh, give me a chance to look it over.

21:24.881 --> 21:27.249
If it's what I need, I'll release Tessa immediately.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.918
I don't want you to release her.

21:29.986 --> 21:30.919
I'm sorry?

21:30.987 --> 21:32.655
Not officially anyway.

21:32.722 --> 21:37.059
I would like the Tobins to think that she's still in custody.

21:37.127 --> 21:41.830
So what do you need from me?

21:41.898 --> 21:43.298
We can't trust Tessa.

21:43.366 --> 21:46.435
If Zedeck is confident she'll protect us, he must have his reasons, Joe.

21:46.502 --> 21:48.804
I don't give a shit what Zedeck says.

21:48.871 --> 21:50.705
Her mother is dead, okay?

21:50.773 --> 21:52.874
The D.A.'s office is going to use that to win her over.

21:52.942 --> 21:55.443
Your father has supported Tessa her whole life.

21:55.511 --> 22:00.215
She has every reason to protect us... I am responsible for this family now, Leonard.

22:00.282 --> 22:01.883
I am responsible!

22:01.951 --> 22:04.920
And she is not family.

22:04.987 --> 22:09.190
Why should she be loyal to us?

22:09.258 --> 22:12.260
She's a problem.

22:14.663 --> 22:19.166
What should we do?

22:19.234 --> 22:21.268
You've hired people before, right?

22:21.336 --> 22:29.777
To find Carol, to have me followed... God knows what else.

22:29.844 --> 22:31.645
There have to be options, Len.

22:31.713 --> 22:33.747
Tessa is in custody.

22:33.815 --> 22:34.781
We can't even get to her.

22:34.849 --> 22:36.350
Well, they can't hold her forever.

22:36.417 --> 22:39.419
Joe, look at me.

22:39.487 --> 22:40.554
I'm your attorney.

22:40.621 --> 22:41.788
I need you need to listen.

22:41.856 --> 22:43.757
I can't let you do anything stupid.

22:43.825 --> 22:44.991
It's not about you.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.294
If you're not willing to help me deal with it.

22:47.361 --> 22:49.362
I am, I am... If you're not willing

22:49.430 --> 22:52.499
to help me deal with it, I can understand.

22:52.566 --> 22:58.705
Joe, I am... I'll find somebody else who can help me.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.867
Thank you for letting me sit in on the Tessa Marchetti meeting.

23:05.934 --> 23:08.002
It'll be a great experience for you.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.037
I'm going to include you more from now on.

23:10.105 --> 23:10.871
I would love that.

23:10.939 --> 23:14.307
When the Tobin case is over, Tom and I are going to

23:14.375 --> 23:17.644
want someone who's ready, Alex.

23:17.678 --> 23:21.080
Someone who could step up, take more responsibility in the firm.

23:21.148 --> 23:23.583
I look forward to it.

23:23.650 --> 23:25.818
That's why I came here.

23:25.886 --> 23:28.387
You sabotaged this office.

23:28.455 --> 23:32.392
You withheld evidence and you took it to Patty Hewes.

23:32.459 --> 23:33.593
Right?

23:33.660 --> 23:34.994
Nick told you?

23:35.062 --> 23:35.828
Yes, Nick told me.

23:35.896 --> 23:36.863
He has respect for his job.

23:36.930 --> 23:40.299
I wasn't trying to undermine you.

23:40.367 --> 23:42.635
I believed Patty would find information that would help us

23:42.703 --> 23:44.737
prosecute the Tobin family for the fraud.

23:44.805 --> 23:46.872
Oh, so you were doing it to help me?

23:46.940 --> 23:49.842
I was doing it to help the case.

23:49.910 --> 23:51.944
That's all you have to say?

23:52.012 --> 23:57.750
Well, it's the truth.

23:57.818 --> 23:59.318
Are you firing me?

23:59.386 --> 24:01.887
Right now, I don't want you around here.

24:01.955 --> 24:05.824
You're on leave indefinitely till I make my final decision.

24:09.329 --> 24:12.331
Go home, Ellen.

24:19.003 --> 24:22.338
We're going to get you out of here.

24:22.405 --> 24:24.206
Thank you.

24:24.274 --> 24:29.444
But first, we want to know the truth about Thanksgiving.

24:29.512 --> 24:32.313
I lied to you, Ms. Hewes.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.648
I was with my mother that night.

24:34.715 --> 24:36.216
We know.

24:36.283 --> 24:39.452
We also know you changed your route with the airline that day.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.289
Yeah, I made my first flight to Antigua.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.056
Why?

24:45.124 --> 24:48.126
Who sent you there?

24:52.464 --> 24:54.265
Louis wants me to fly tonight?

24:54.332 --> 24:55.132
He needs you to.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.366
He's in trouble, Tessa.

24:56.434 --> 24:57.200
He may go to jail.

24:57.268 --> 24:59.235
How often does he want me to go down there?

24:59.303 --> 25:00.102
Just once a week.

25:00.170 --> 25:03.374
You'll deposit your paycheck and sign some documents at a bank.

25:05.109 --> 25:06.876
Hello?

25:06.944 --> 25:07.843
I left my pills.

25:07.911 --> 25:09.711
Please bring them over.

25:09.779 --> 25:11.279
Isn't your family there?

25:11.347 --> 25:12.347
I don't care.

25:12.415 --> 25:14.282
Leave them in the lobby.

25:14.350 --> 25:15.750
Louis, are you sure?

25:15.818 --> 25:16.918
Just do it, Danielle.

25:16.986 --> 25:18.186
Goddamn it, just do it!

25:18.254 --> 25:18.853
Okay.

25:18.921 --> 25:19.854
I have to go.

25:19.922 --> 25:22.256
Mom, you know more than you're telling me.

25:22.323 --> 25:25.358
The documents you'll be signing will be sending money to a charity.

25:25.426 --> 25:26.692
That's all you'll be doing.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.860
I promise.

25:27.928 --> 25:29.061
Take this.

25:29.129 --> 25:30.162
Call Lenny.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.130
Tell him to come pick these up.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.932
No one can know that I spoke to Louis tonight.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.102
Trust me, baby, it's going to be okay.

25:44.773 --> 25:47.608
Your mother said you were helping transfer money to a charity?

25:47.675 --> 25:48.675
Yes.

25:48.743 --> 25:50.176
Was I stupid to believe her?

25:50.244 --> 25:56.515
No, no, the Tobins were involved with several charities.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.884
Do you remember if your mother mentioned one by name?

25:58.952 --> 26:00.319
I don't think so.

26:00.386 --> 26:02.554
When you were cashing your paychecks at the

26:02.622 --> 26:06.258
Royal Antiguan Bank, you mentioned that you signed three documents.

26:06.326 --> 26:08.493
Yeah, in order to get American currency.

26:08.561 --> 26:13.765
Is it possible that a charity's name was on that third document?

26:13.833 --> 26:14.966
I don't think so.

26:15.034 --> 26:16.134
I would've seen it.

26:16.202 --> 26:18.370
Do you have copies of that document?

26:18.437 --> 26:21.006
No, they keep everything at the bank.

26:21.074 --> 26:22.941
Do you remember anything about that form?

26:23.009 --> 26:23.875
Not really.

26:23.943 --> 26:26.243
I signed it so many times, but it was just a bunch of numbers.

26:26.311 --> 26:29.414
Numbers and, um, maybe some random letters.

26:29.482 --> 26:32.283
Could be an iban.

26:32.351 --> 26:33.317
What's that?

26:33.385 --> 26:36.687
Routing codes for transferring money to an account in the U.S.

26:36.754 --> 26:42.927
Tessa, how would you feel about going back down to Antigua?

26:42.994 --> 26:46.197
Whatever you need.

26:48.566 --> 26:51.468
What does Tessa actually know?

26:51.536 --> 26:53.637
We're not sure.

26:55.272 --> 26:58.007
I know that look, Lenny.

26:58.075 --> 27:01.478
What else is wrong?

27:01.545 --> 27:04.349
Protecting the money is the only thing that matters to Joe.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.250
He's not thinking clearly.

27:05.317 --> 27:08.086
What do you mean?

27:08.153 --> 27:11.822
Tessa isn't safe.

27:15.460 --> 27:19.698
Lou never would've wanted anything to happen to her.

27:19.765 --> 27:22.133
You have to intervene.

27:22.201 --> 27:24.435
How?

27:24.503 --> 27:28.239
Tell Joe the truth.

27:28.307 --> 27:29.540
You didn't tell him?

27:29.608 --> 27:31.576
It's not my place, Marilyn.

27:31.643 --> 27:36.314
You need to.

27:36.382 --> 27:42.720
Joe needs to know Tessa is his daughter.

27:54.765 --> 27:56.165
I'm Malcolm.

27:56.233 --> 28:00.803
I'll be keeping an eye on you in case you have any sudden urges to contact the Tobins.

28:00.871 --> 28:01.938
Don't worry.

28:02.006 --> 28:05.041
I won't.

28:08.042 --> 28:10.008
Thank you for letting Tessa out.

28:10.075 --> 28:15.178
See what can happen when we decide to work together?

28:25.588 --> 28:26.988
Ah, shit.

28:27.723 --> 28:30.191
Oh, you are good.

28:32.694 --> 28:34.361
I'm glad you liked it.

28:35.763 --> 28:39.031
You are a fun kid.

28:52.781 --> 28:54.449
So, how's it feel to be me?

28:54.516 --> 28:56.684
I could get used to that.

28:58.421 --> 29:00.489
No, hmm-mm.

29:00.556 --> 29:01.456
Well, no pressure.

29:01.524 --> 29:06.428
I just... I just thought you were looking for the underbelly.

29:09.766 --> 29:10.366
Come on.

29:10.433 --> 29:13.936
Shit.

29:16.272 --> 29:18.807
I'll trade you.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.576
Now, there's something you've got to understand.

29:20.644 --> 29:21.244
Here, cheers.

29:21.311 --> 29:21.911
Cheers.

29:25.083 --> 29:28.553
This is not just about pleasure.

29:28.621 --> 29:29.287
No, huh?

29:29.355 --> 29:30.389
No.

29:30.456 --> 29:36.329
No, all of this... all of this releases me.

29:36.397 --> 29:39.933
In fact, I... This is the spot I came to

29:40.001 --> 29:44.105
to make the biggest decisions of my life.

29:44.172 --> 29:46.307
Who to lay off?

29:47.843 --> 29:48.809
Screw you.

29:49.711 --> 29:51.478
No, I mean it. Screw you.

29:53.915 --> 30:00.621
No, no, I, uh... there's a rawness that, um, I get in touch with.

30:00.689 --> 30:05.126
And I find clarity in that.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.161
I find clarity in darkness.

30:10.099 --> 30:15.170
This is the kind of stuff I want to know.

30:15.238 --> 30:18.240
How dark do you get?

30:25.248 --> 30:30.119
All right.

30:30.186 --> 30:36.225
How far would you go... to protect your money?

30:36.292 --> 30:36.959
Your family?

30:37.026 --> 30:40.029
What would you do if every single thing that mattered was

30:40.096 --> 30:43.900
being threatened?

30:43.967 --> 30:45.167
Threatened how?

30:45.235 --> 30:46.702
Someone out there.

30:46.770 --> 30:51.206
You know, someone who could take everything.

30:51.274 --> 30:53.041
Shit.

30:53.109 --> 30:54.476
Shit.

30:54.543 --> 31:00.081
And then, what-what if a man came up to you and he said...

31:00.149 --> 31:05.720
"I can make all your problems go away. Forever"?

31:08.190 --> 31:10.725
What would you have to do?

31:10.793 --> 31:12.793
Nothing.

31:12.861 --> 31:16.363
Just say the word.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.268
What could he do for you?

31:22.335 --> 31:26.338
Anything.

31:31.009 --> 31:33.576
Shit.

31:36.613 --> 31:39.349
That's the dark side, my friend.

31:39.416 --> 31:44.421
It doesn't get any darker than that.

31:46.458 --> 31:53.431
Art... what kind of shit are we talking about here?

31:55.433 --> 31:56.900
What's up?

31:56.967 --> 32:00.334
I want you to cut off any communication with Ellen.

32:00.402 --> 32:01.500
Why?

32:01.568 --> 32:04.364
Either she was sloppy or she disobeyed me.

32:04.432 --> 32:06.430
What makes you say that?

32:06.497 --> 32:08.831
She told me she approached Tessa.

32:08.899 --> 32:11.433
Even after I told her not to.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.101
That's how Gates found out about what we're trying to do.

32:14.169 --> 32:15.269
Patty, h... hold on.

32:15.336 --> 32:16.536
I let my guard down.

32:16.604 --> 32:20.840
I should never have let her back in.

32:21.942 --> 32:31.048
Look, uh... whatever Ellen told you, she was... covering up for me.

32:31.116 --> 32:32.516
She didn't approach Tessa.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.585
I did.

32:37.054 --> 32:37.654
I'm sorry.

32:37.721 --> 32:41.557
I was... I was... I was impatient, and I... I screwed up.

32:41.624 --> 32:45.226
The truth is, Ellen tried to salvage my mistake.

32:45.294 --> 32:48.262
She was the one who steered Tessa back to us.

32:52.432 --> 32:54.866
Why did you do it?

32:54.933 --> 32:58.735
I did what I thought I had to.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.974
So the two of you were strategizing behind my back.

33:06.042 --> 33:08.376
And then you lied to me about it.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.412
Yeah.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.480
I lied to you.

33:16.116 --> 33:18.484
Have you ever lied to me?

33:21.820 --> 33:24.287
I've got work to do.

33:24.355 --> 33:29.190
I made a judgment call, and I took a risk.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.258
I'm done apologizing.

33:45.105 --> 33:48.040
I'd like you to start looking for new cases.

33:48.107 --> 33:49.341
Excellent.

33:49.408 --> 33:51.176
Any particular area?

33:51.243 --> 33:54.812
Um, bring me whatever you're most passionate about.

33:54.880 --> 33:58.749
Uh, maybe pharmaceutical class actions or constitutional violations.

33:58.817 --> 34:01.351
Alex, you can bring whatever you want.

34:01.419 --> 34:03.653
That's how we work here.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.721
Okay.

34:19.431 --> 34:21.065
Did you tell him?

34:21.132 --> 34:22.900
Yes.

34:22.967 --> 34:26.235
Joe's going to leave Tessa alone.

34:28.804 --> 34:31.272
Are you okay?

34:31.340 --> 34:34.141
Louis should have told Joe sooner.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.976
He couldn't.

34:37.043 --> 34:40.978
Joe wouldn't have been able to handle it back then.

34:41.047 --> 34:44.315
He couldn't take care of himself, much less a child.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.920
Well, now he knows.

35:00.771 --> 35:01.904
You all set?

35:01.972 --> 35:03.439
Yeah, I'm ready.

35:03.507 --> 35:04.974
All right.

35:05.041 --> 35:07.242
You'll go to the bank like it's business as usual.

35:07.310 --> 35:09.311
Make your deposit, sign the paperwork.

35:09.379 --> 35:12.414
And I keep the third document.

35:12.482 --> 35:15.083
We shouldn't be seen together, so you'll leave now.

35:15.151 --> 35:18.252
I'll be waiting for you across the street from the bank.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.889
Get in the car, and we'll go straight to the airport.

35:21.957 --> 35:24.858
Got it.

35:42.876 --> 35:45.013
You're out walking in the middle of the day.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.681
Work's been a bit iffy.

35:46.749 --> 35:49.652
Suddenly got all this time on my hands.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.020
Must be nice.

35:52.088 --> 35:53.322
I guess.

35:53.389 --> 35:56.491
I don't know what to do with myself.

35:59.161 --> 36:00.995
You went to see that woman.

36:01.062 --> 36:02.596
Yeah.

36:02.664 --> 36:04.897
My babysitter.

36:04.965 --> 36:06.498
What were you expecting to find?

36:06.566 --> 36:08.166
I don't know.

36:08.234 --> 36:12.404
- I was hoping... - Hoping what?

36:12.472 --> 36:13.138
I'm not sure.

36:13.206 --> 36:15.074
It was stupid.

36:15.141 --> 36:18.877
Know, you've always been trying to rewrite your family history.

36:18.945 --> 36:20.245
What do you mean?

36:20.313 --> 36:22.380
Well, you started by being the good girl who never

36:22.448 --> 36:24.647
got in trouble, then the perfect student.

36:24.715 --> 36:28.562
Now the successful attorney.

36:28.630 --> 36:31.228
I finally figure you and Patty.

36:31.229 --> 36:32.347
Ah?

36:32.415 --> 36:34.713
You both hate bullies.

36:34.780 --> 36:37.554
It's what drives you.

36:37.621 --> 36:40.437
Your father was a bully.

36:40.505 --> 36:43.410
And I remember, Ellen. I saw it.

36:43.478 --> 36:45.292
How he treated your mom and Carrie.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.532
And you couldn't stop him.

36:48.599 --> 36:50.614
You were helpless.

36:50.671 --> 36:54.143
And that's why you're drawn to Patty, she's not.

36:54.211 --> 37:00.155
But, Ellen... if you want to keep working for Patty, go back to her.

37:00.223 --> 37:03.685
If not, then really move on.

37:03.753 --> 37:05.734
Stop talking to her.

37:07.984 --> 37:10.398
Thanks, David.

37:16.378 --> 37:19.049
I'm sorry.

37:19.117 --> 37:21.856
For what?

37:21.923 --> 37:26.220
I haven't been thinking about you as much as I used to.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.435
That's good.

37:27.502 --> 37:30.184
But I haven't forgotten.

37:31.767 --> 37:33.748
I miss you.

37:59.432 --> 38:01.680
It's nice to see you, Mary.

38:01.748 --> 38:05.277
If Tessa comes through, we'll need to

38:05.345 --> 38:06.992
cross-reference the routing codes.

38:07.060 --> 38:08.617
With a list of every bank in the U.S.

38:08.684 --> 38:10.799
I pulled it already.

38:10.866 --> 38:13.738
And, uh, we'll need a list of charities.

38:13.806 --> 38:15.944
I've gone through the Tobins' 1040s.

38:16.011 --> 38:19.751
I figured I'd start with the charities they donated to regularly.

38:19.808 --> 38:25.062
If that's how the Tobins laundered the money...

38:31.243 --> 38:34.214
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?

38:34.282 --> 38:38.736
She's smart, ambitious, very dedicated.

38:38.803 --> 38:41.642
She'll fit right in.

38:41.709 --> 38:44.024
Yes?

38:44.092 --> 38:47.130
You were saying?

38:47.198 --> 38:49.479
I'm glad you like her.

38:49.537 --> 38:52.419
I didn't say I liked her.

38:54.725 --> 38:57.307
Patty?

38:57.374 --> 38:59.846
I'm sorry, Alex.

38:59.913 --> 39:03.509
It's not working out.

39:03.577 --> 39:05.858
What's not working out?

39:05.926 --> 39:07.907
You.

39:10.123 --> 39:12.261
I don't understand.

39:12.329 --> 39:15.434
I think you do.

39:15.502 --> 39:17.916
Are you firing me?

39:17.984 --> 39:19.965
It's not personal.

39:22.739 --> 39:26.701
Take the afternoon and clean out your office.

39:51.443 --> 39:54.014
Malcolm?

39:54.081 --> 39:57.053
Malcolm?

39:57.121 --> 39:58.111
I have the document.

39:58.179 --> 40:01.184
I thought you were gonna meet me at the bank and...

40:04.291 --> 40:06.729
Oh, my God.

40:06.797 --> 40:09.969
Oh, my God.

40:10.037 --> 40:13.076
Tessa Marchetti?

40:13.143 --> 40:14.067
Please.

40:14.134 --> 40:16.049
No. No.

40:35.899 --> 40:37.177
Yes?

40:37.245 --> 40:41.027
Emanuel your fears were well-founded, Mr. Tobin.

40:41.094 --> 40:45.164
Ms. Marchetti came back to Antigua.

40:45.232 --> 40:47.233
But all is well.

40:50.003 --> 40:53.807
Mr. Tobin, are you there?

40:53.875 --> 40:55.876
Thank you.

41:03.986 --> 41:05.988
The money's safe.

41:13.965 --> 41:16.734
It's not your fault, Joe.

41:20.206 --> 41:23.909
Your father had a daughter with Danielle Marchetti.

41:23.977 --> 41:26.879
This was his mistake.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.118
You did it for your child.

41:35.121 --> 41:40.159
You did it for all of us, for our f... for our f... our future.

41:49.604 --> 41:51.839
You had no choice.
