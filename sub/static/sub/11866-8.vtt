CARTER: Come on, Zoe!
ZOE: Just a minute!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.186
This is obstruction
of justice.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.941
(LAUGHING)
And how do you figure?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.859
You're making me
late for work.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.776
So, you're justice.
Yeah, I'm justice.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.612
SARAH: Sheriff,
do you need your coffee?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.785
What do you think?
Pouring now.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.659
Hurry it up, Zoe!

00:42.876 --> 00:46.869
SARAH, if this is the house
of the future, how come
there's only one bathroom?

00:46.922 --> 00:49.584
Is there a shortage
of bathrooms in the future?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.967
Where is it?
Where's what?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.718
Your hair.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.094
Where's my hair?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.892
No, you...
What did you do to it?

01:02.938 --> 01:05.554
Let me guess.
You don't like it.
No, I didn't say that.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.271
So you do like it.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.020
I didn't say that either.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.438
Figures.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.147
Now, come on!
I mean, did it even occur
to you to ask me?

01:14.700 --> 01:16.691
You always say no.
No, I don't.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.696
So, if I would've asked you,
you would've said yes?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.246
We would've
discussed it.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.241
And then you would've
said no.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.947
That's not the point.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.498
Okay, I got
to go to school.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.746
We're not done
discussing this.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.457
And don't forget,
you have a therapy session
with Beverly today.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.789
About that, look, I...
No "about that."
We had a deal.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.089
Well,
I want to renegotiate.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.466
Well, you should've
thought of that

01:34.553 --> 01:36.214
before you set your head
on fire. You're going.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.469
Fine.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.963
And wear a hat!

02:07.502 --> 02:10.790
Judging by those dark circles,
I'd say iron deficiency.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.338
More like sleep deficiency.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.791
Stark's killing me.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.129
Well, this will pep you up.

and ginseng reduction.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.719
Eudoxus of Cnidus?

02:24.936 --> 02:27.097
The Greek astronomer?

02:31.026 --> 02:33.187
Honestly, I don't know
why I bother.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.946
Oh, my God.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.824
Callister Raynes?

02:45.957 --> 02:46.946
Hello, Vincent.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.992
VINCENT: I thought
you'd dropped off
the face of the planet.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.117
Close enough.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.589
So, what brings you back?

02:56.259 --> 02:58.466
Guess I was feeling
a little homesick.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.797
Have you seen her yet?

03:03.558 --> 03:04.547
Who?

03:04.643 --> 03:07.055
Please, you know exactly
who I'm talking about.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.510
Jo.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.226
Not yet.
You think she's still mad?

03:13.819 --> 03:17.027
Well, she's still Jo, so...

03:19.449 --> 03:21.030
Listen, Callister,
for what it's worth,

03:21.118 --> 03:23.279
I never believed
you were responsible.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.235
And I don't think
Jo did either.

03:26.373 --> 03:30.116
But you probably
don't want to talk
about that right now.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.286
What about Stark?
Does he know you're here?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.204
Any minute now.

NATHAN: Ladies, gentlemen,
distinguished colleagues,

03:41.096 --> 03:43.462
thank you so much
for taking time out
of your busy schedules

03:43.557 --> 03:46.139
to join me here today,
but I assure you what...

03:46.226 --> 03:48.808
Dr. Stark,
I need to talk to you.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.055
(BEEPING)

03:50.105 --> 03:51.720
Excuse me for a moment.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.267
I swear to God, Fargo,
the world better be on fire.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.738
Actually, pretty close.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.075
I'm sorry, but something's
come up that demands
my immediate attention.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.578
We'll have to continue
this at a later time.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.297
Hey, George Jetson!
How's it going?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.224
Looks like some kind
of program error
fried one of the chips.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.393
You're going to have
to give me a minute
to put in a new one.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.811
All right. Well, hurry up.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.641
Traffic cop is so not
in my job description.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.435
You must not have read
the fine print.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.781
But on the bright side,
the orange really
brings out your eyes.

You have no idea.

05:30.539 --> 05:31.528
So?

05:32.666 --> 05:36.033
Oh, Jo's filling out
the security reports
as we speak.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.503
That's what
you said yesterday.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.373
Because that's what
she told me yesterday.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.331
Hey, stop it slow!
All set!

05:44.219 --> 05:46.835
(BEEPING)

05:53.520 --> 05:55.306
Let me know if it gives you
anymore trouble.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.936
Thanks, Henry.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.184
So, come on.
I'll let you buy me
a cup of coffee.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.766
It's free.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.943
Well, in that case I'll buy.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.530
Okay.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.692
I think this could
be our thing.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.859
Don't push it, traffic boy.
We don't have a thing.

out on the thermostat.
Just roll with it.

Hot toddy?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.810
Is that Christmas music?

I said just roll with it.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.556
Okay.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.851
So, admit it.
We have a thing.

You've got to be
kidding me.

Ouch. All right.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.239
Not you. Him.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.077
Just strolls in here
this morning like nothing
everhappened.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.866
Who's Callister Raynes?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.208
He was a computer programmer
that Nathan brought in
for a classified project.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.632
Brilliant kid.
Everyone loved him.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.956
l'm sensing a "but."

07:06.051 --> 07:08.212
But the two of them
had a falling out.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.378
A week later,
Nathan's lab was
destroyed by a fire.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.420
Wow.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.551

the prime suspect.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.744
l was just about to stop by
and see if you...

07:46.800 --> 07:48.210
That's for coming back.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.758
And that's for leaving.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.007
ngetback
to those reports.
No rush.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.184
They have a history.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.477
I gathered.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.813
What?

08:07.862 --> 08:11.320
Taking the Christmas theme
a bit far, don't you think?

if you were okay.

I'll be fine.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.653
You didn't say over.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.205
I know. It's going to
bug her all day long.

Figured you'd find
your way here
sooner or later.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.009
l was curious
how much you kept.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.715
I probably should've
destroyed it all
after you left,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.677
but I couldn't.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.518
I didn't realize
you were so sentimental.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.029
You can't be here,
Callister.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.775
We can't risk it.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.034
I know.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.239
Then why did you come back?

is very wrong.

Not gonna hit me,
are you?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.691
What happened
between Callister
and me was private.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.567
Yeah, I gathered that
from the way you handled it

12:26.621 --> 12:28.737
so discreetly
in a very public cafe.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.368
Yeah.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.582
So, what's the problem here?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.916
Osborne said he had
a power surge this morning

12:36.965 --> 12:39.502
and his electrical fence
is malfunctioning.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.425

run off a computer?

in Eureka does. Why?

it was magnetized.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.628

I'll go see
if I can shut it down.

That'd be super.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.468
Oh, good.

everyone wouldn't get
a chance to see this.

What are you doing here?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.281

13:47.535 --> 13:49.446
Yeah, yeah.
Got it under control.

on it later.

You might want
to come to Henry's.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.787
l have a feeling you're
gonna want to hear this.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.372
How long?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.954
A few weeks.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.497
Maybe more.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.339
How bad?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.011
I've been losing control.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.796
And it's getting worse.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.804
Okay, I want you
to stay here.
No.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.891
I didn't come
all the way back
to be left alone.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.224
It is too dangerous
for you to be wandering
around town.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.025
Dangerous for who?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.728
Listen to me.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.405
I'm not going through
all that again,

16:33.493 --> 16:36.985
not after everything
I sacrificed to help
youleave.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.618
You're not the only one
who sacrificed.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.961
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.301
There's your problem.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.512
That's what's been
messing up everything
on the Internet.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.473
Is this our glitch?
Glitch? No, that's a virus.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.229
You guys should have
switched to Macs.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.773
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.694
You see, Eureka has its own
operating system, one that's
unlike any in the world.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.446
Viruses don't just happen.
They have to be written
by someone

17:14.534 --> 17:16.820
who is intimately familiar
with the operating system.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.908
Like, oh, say,
a computer programmer
who used to live in Eureka?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.201
Point taken. Henry,
how dangerous is this?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.867
Well, the entire system is
run on a wireless Internet.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.332
And the traffic light,
the AC, the electric fence.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.621
HENRY: lfthe virus
isn't stopped,

17:29.715 --> 17:31.330
whoever is behind it
may be able to get access

17:31.384 --> 17:33.090
to something
more dangerous
than traffic lights.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.587
All right.
How do you want
to deal with this?

17:34.679 --> 17:36.761
Why don't you talk
to Stark? See if Callister
contacted him

17:36.847 --> 17:38.633
and what he knows
about the virus.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.364
Jo.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.904
Carter, please,
I'm almost done, okay?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.409
This isn't about
the security checks.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.742
I need the file
on the fire that Callister
was accused of setting.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.878
He wasn't accused,
he was suspected
and we cleared him.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.005
Well, maybe he wasn't
involved with what
happened then,

18:13.092 --> 18:15.583
but I'm pretty sure
he's involved
with what's happening now.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.753
Carter, I know
this is gonna sound weird,
especially coming from me,

18:18.806 --> 18:21.388
but he's not like that.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.428
And I hope that you're right,

18:23.519 --> 18:26.431
but you know as well
as I do that I can't stop
an investigation

18:26.480 --> 18:29.142
just because you're involved
with some guy.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.433
lwouldn't ask you to.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.618
| just thought you might
want my opinion.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.245
Jo...
I've got to get back
to those reports.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.136
Hey.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.635
Oh, hello.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.057
Guest or patient?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.760
Excuse me?
Are you a guest
or a patient?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.555
l have a room here,
if that's what you mean.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.141
Yes, but is it padded?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.773
I'm a guest.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.153
Cool.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.734
Patient.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.774
Not like I'm crazy
or anything.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.818
Actually my dad's
making me go here.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.253
I don't know. Other stuff.
I wasn't really
paying attention so...

19:34.674 --> 19:36.505
You two don't get along?

19:36.759 --> 19:39.501
He thinks I'm a delinquent

19:39.595 --> 19:43.508
but, you know,
I'm just a product
of my environment.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.925
Believe me,
I know that feeling.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.518
l'm Callister.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.773
Zoe.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.361
Nice to meet you, Zoe.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.779
I like your hair.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.731
Thank you, Callister.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.069
Thank you, Duncan.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.327
l was able to reschedule
the demonstration for 3:00.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.204
Good, because
you're gonna be running it.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.376
What? Why?
I'm taking
the rest of the day.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.253
Well, that's
got to be a first.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.377
Allison.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.253
Fargo, give us a minute?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.965
Did you know
Callister Raynes
was coming back?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.807
I didn't even know
he was here.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.054
Really?

20:30.104 --> 20:31.560
So he hasn't contacted you?

20:31.605 --> 20:34.597
I think that was implied
by my first answer.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.850
Now if you'll excuse me,
Allison.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.983
Are you all right?
I'm just feeling
a little under the weather.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.531
You haven't taken a sick day
since I've known you.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.284
You always told me
to take better care of myself.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.862
There's a virus
on the Internet, Nathan.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.373
Eureka has a virus.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.410
Okay, I'll take care of it.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.703
Right now, I've got to go.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.792
Nathan,
what is going on really?

20:58.883 --> 21:01.625
Nothing is going on,
all right? Really.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.210
I'll take care of the virus.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.098
Well, this inventory list
doesn't make any sense.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.305
I mean, you can't tell me
that in Stark's
top secret lab,

21:12.396 --> 21:14.773
all he had was
the standard stuff
listed here.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.018
It was a fire.
It probably burned.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.485
Well,
that's exactly my point.

21:18.569 --> 21:21.811
Anything lost in a fire
has got to be documented
as destroyed.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.113
Unless it's classified.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.366
That's a good point.

21:29.872 --> 21:33.456
Can you run Callister's name
through your security check?

21:34.919 --> 21:37.535
Fine, but you're not
gonna find anything.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.169
Nothing came up.
It was worth a shot.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.879
No, I mean nothing came up.

21:49.099 --> 21:52.717
It's like somebody's
gone in here and erased
all his records.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.815
Hold on,
I'm getting a fax.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.890
This guy isn't
who he says he is.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.653
He's been lying
about everything.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.906
Someone's been
lying all right.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.074
Son of a bitch.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.759
Hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.921
Zoe, you look, lovely.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.050
Thank you.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.517
Your room is all ready,
Callister.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.142
If you need anything else,
you just let me know.
Okay?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.639
(TIRES SCREECHING)

22:40.234 --> 22:43.317
The lies stop
right here. Right now.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.192
I know what you did.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.038
Identity theft.
Credit card fraud.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.664
What the hell
were you thinking?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.499
Look, the credit card
company will cover it.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.415
The most she's gonna
have to pay is,
like, 50 bucks.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.215
That's not the point!

23:07.303 --> 23:08.543
Ajeet...

23:11.140 --> 23:13.506
Gandhavadi shouldn't
have to pay a penny for you.

23:13.559 --> 23:14.639
I'll pay her back.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.967
I thought
we were past this!

23:16.061 --> 23:17.392
We are... lam!

23:17.479 --> 23:19.811
Look, that was from before
I even came here.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.187
Exactly,
and when you showed up,
what did I say?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.851
Look at me!
What did you promise me?

23:29.617 --> 23:30.732
No more secrets.

23:30.784 --> 23:31.773
Exactly.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.076
When you showed up,
it was all cards
on the table,

23:34.121 --> 23:35.452
no secrets.
That was our deal.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.951
And you sat there
and you lied to my face.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.408
And for what?
A shopping spree?

23:40.461 --> 23:43.328
A trip to Bermuda?
Some online gambling?
What was it? What was it...

23:43.422 --> 23:46.084
I bought a bus ticket!
To Eureka!

23:51.639 --> 23:53.379
You had to steal it?

23:54.016 --> 23:55.847
You couldn't
come to me for help?

23:56.685 --> 23:57.970
Yeah, right.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.223
Don't do that.
That's not fair.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.887
I haven't always
been the world's
greatest dad,

24:01.941 --> 24:04.102
but I have always
been there for you
when you needed help.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.733
So you're saying
that if I said that I wanted
to come live here,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.644
you would just
make it happen.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.529
Of course.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.948
VVeH,Iguess
we're both liars, now.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.786
I can't do this anymore.
I'm done, Zoe.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.451
Dad!
Done! Not a word!

24:26.298 --> 24:27.799
Is he always that angry?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.797
We're working on it.

I'm cutting you off.
I think three's your limit.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.456
I don't pay you to think.
I pay you to pour.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.914
Actually,
you don't pay me at all.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.962
What's going on, Zoe?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.510
Oh, I don't know.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.303
My dad hates me.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.223
Why? What did you do?

25:20.310 --> 25:23.848

automatically assume
that it's my fault?

Okay, yes,
but not the point.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.524
I screwed up. Bad.

25:37.703 --> 25:41.070
And now he's sending me
back to LA.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.746
He said that.
Yes.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.620
Okay, no, but I can read
between the lines.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.589
He said
he was done with me.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.917
Zoe, he's not gonna
send you away.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.300
You're right.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.556
And you know why?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.384
'Cause I'm not
gonna let him.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.895
Good for you.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.440
Bye, Vince.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.038
Carter? Where the hell
have you been?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.170
I don't want
to talk about it.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.416
Are you okay?

26:32.466 --> 26:35.458
Yeah.
Could we just work now?

26:35.552 --> 26:37.292
Really want to work.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.846
All right.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.806
Did you get anything
from Stark?

26:42.893 --> 26:45.680
Not really. He said
he didn't even know
Callister was here.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.477
What happened when you
mentioned the virus?

26:47.564 --> 26:51.022
He gave me this weird look
and then he just ran off.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.650
That's not
at all suspicious.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.022
Yeah.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.150
And you think
he'd be worried about
the effects on Global.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.448
Well, maybe he's worried
about something else.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.740
Or someone else.

27:05.999 --> 27:08.126
This is the case file
from the fire.

to Callister torching

27:12.840 --> 27:15.877
but Stark insisted
it was faulty wiring.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.969
So you think that
he was protecting Callister?

27:20.013 --> 27:21.969
I think he still is.

I don't know.

screaming for Callister.

Callister got burned.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.727
Okay.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.858
Henry!
Where's the hydrant?

28:58.904 --> 29:00.235
I'll help you hook it up.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.187
Carter, this is Eureka.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.990
Beverly, is everybody out?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.409
Yes.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.736

29:24.471 --> 29:25.677
Right.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.475
As you can see,

29:39.569 --> 29:42.481
Limitless capabilities
for replication.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.437
Where are they, Fargo?

29:46.535 --> 29:49.368
If you'll excuse me
for a moment, everyone.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.033
Can't you see
I'm in a meeting?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.911
Where are they?

29:54.960 --> 29:56.621
I honestly don't know.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.875
Let me come
at this another way.

30:02.009 --> 30:05.422
Do you know where
your Sarah Michelle Gellar
doll is?

30:05.554 --> 30:06.885
Because I do,

30:07.139 --> 30:10.631
and if! have to,
I will go get it out
of your desk

30:10.726 --> 30:13.638
and show it
to those nice people.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.980
Now, where do you
think they are?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.901
ALLISON:
There's Nathan's car.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.654
Are you okay?
I don't know.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.161
I mean, technically,
I'm still married to Nathan,

30:36.251 --> 30:38.742
but right now
I have no idea
who he even is.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.579
Well, whatever's going on,
if he's lying I'm sure
he has a reason.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.379
What could that
possibly be?

30:43.467 --> 30:46.254
I don't know,
but I think we're
about to find out.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.183
ALLISON: Oh, my God.

31:22.089 --> 31:24.751
Stark, step aside!
Callister! Put your hands
in the air!

31:24.841 --> 31:26.001
Carter, wait!
Quiet!

31:26.051 --> 31:27.712
Callister, put your hands
where I can see them.

31:27.761 --> 31:28.876
Carter, listen to me.

31:28.929 --> 31:30.260
Nathan!
Allison, I can explain.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.258
Carter, do not hurt him.
Don't want to.

31:32.349 --> 31:35.682
Callister,
I don't want to shoot you.
Show me your hands.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.680
I can't.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.729
Yes, you can.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.398
Do as he says.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.463
Okay. Not where
I thought this was going.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.428
ldidn't bring him here.
I built him here.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.642
Callister's Al.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.103
So he's a robot.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.268
An artificially
intelligent being.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.568
Then why keep him
a secret?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.111
I mean, this has to be
one of the greatest

32:27.195 --> 32:29.026
scientific breakthroughs
of the modern age.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.604
So was the atomic bomb.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.323
That doesn't mean
the world was ready for it.

32:33.827 --> 32:37.536
Truth is, I needed
to see if Callister
could assimilate.

32:38.915 --> 32:42.658
So I introduced him
to Eureka as my assistant,

32:43.128 --> 32:44.959
and they embraced him.

32:45.172 --> 32:49.632
Callister formed attachments,
felt relationships.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.133
And you did, too?

32:55.140 --> 32:58.507
I wasn't about to let DARPA
turn him into another
military project.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.763
How is this possible?

33:00.854 --> 33:02.060
I don't know.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.431
I had dozens of prototypes.
None of them worked,

33:06.109 --> 33:08.646
except for Callister.
I still don't know why.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.482
It's a miracle.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.987
So he didn't burn down
your lab. You did.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.615
I needed them to believe
that the entire project
had been destroyed,

33:24.377 --> 33:28.040
but then Sheriff Cobb
started asking
a bunch of questions,

33:28.131 --> 33:29.792
so I had to send him away.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.048
But, how is he
connected to the virus?

33:32.177 --> 33:34.293
Callister transmits
on a wireless network.

33:35.055 --> 33:38.718
I thought it! changed
his primary microprocessor,
I could fix it.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.935
But his system is
totally corrupted.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.852
Nathan, I'm sorry,
but you know
he can't stay here.

33:43.897 --> 33:45.933
That fire could've
killed someone.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.936
I know, but I can't
send him away.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.818

No, and we looked
everywhere.

immediately. Thanks.

They found the car
at a gas station
off Interstate 17.

there was a red-headed girl

ditch the car

unless they had
some other way
of getting around.

of public transportation.

and asked to come to Eureka,

for the rest of my life.
