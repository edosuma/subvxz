My, oh, my.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.360
You know, Howie,
I want to go to you first.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.040
What did you think of that?

12:51.040 --> 12:53.120
- I don't--
so surprising.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
- Yeah.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.360
- How does one--

12:55.360 --> 12:57.680
When did you first--

12:57.680 --> 12:59.640
Why?

12:59.640 --> 12:59.939
- I started training
when I was 24 years old.

12:59.939 --> 13:01.520
- I started training
when I was 24 years old.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.880
- Training to do what?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.480
What is it that you do?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.320
- I am a contortionist.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.240
- I'll just say this,
as a Jew.

13:09.240 --> 13:13.760
Most Jewish men,
just sitting down, go, "Ugh."

13:13.760 --> 13:15.240
Like that, we do that.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.000
You're wonderful;
it's amazing.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.120
- Thank you, Howie.
Thank you so much.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.120
- Heidi, what did you think?
- It was beautiful.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.280
It was fluid.
It was kind of weird,

13:24.280 --> 13:26.160
but it was amazing.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.680
- It really was.
- Thank you so much, Heidi.

13:29.680 --> 13:29.939
- It was fantastically weird.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.240
- It was fantastically weird.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.000
You know like,
sometimes you watch

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
those wildlife documentaries
about insects,

13:36.000 --> 13:40.080
and you're kind of like,
"What the bloody hell is that?"

13:40.080 --> 13:42.120
And I kind of felt the same way.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.040
I had no idea
what you were doing

13:44.040 --> 13:46.160
or really what the act was,

13:46.160 --> 13:48.680
but I'm gonna remember you,
Jonathan.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.720
- Thank you very much, Simon.
Thank you very much.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.160
- I mean, Jonathan,
I have to say,

13:54.160 --> 13:58.600
usually, it's women that come
on here and do contortion,

13:58.600 --> 13:59.939
and they're in their
sparkly, sexy outfit.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.000
and they're in their
sparkly, sexy outfit.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.800
I was literally floored.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.920
I had no idea
where you were gonna take it.

14:04.920 --> 14:08.000
But I absolutely loved it.
Loved it.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.920
- Thank you so much.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.360
- But anyway,
it's time to vote.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.440
Howie?

14:14.440 --> 14:16.080
- You've got your first yes
from me.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.920
- Thank you,
thank you very much.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.320
- Heidi?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.440
- And you're gonna get
your second yes from me.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.520
- Thank you, Heidi,
thank you so very much.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.040
- Simon?
- What would you do next?

14:26.040 --> 14:29.040
- Oh, it's--get ready.
- Really?

14:29.040 --> 14:29.939
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm ready.

14:29.939 --> 14:31.040
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm ready.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
It's three yeses.
- Thank you so much, Simon.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.480
- And you've got your
fourth yes from me.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.040
Congratulations.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.680
- That was great.
That was great.

14:42.680 --> 14:43.880
- Whoo!

14:46.520 --> 14:48.600
- That was good.
That was a nice surprise.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.760
- You caught them off-guard.
You surprised them.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.800
- Beautiful thing.
Thank you, my friend.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.920

90 seconds, y'all, to get
out there to do our thing.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.280

- We do.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.040

to a public school

15:45.600 --> 15:47.080
on the southwest side
of Chicago,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.360
and it's a very rough
neighborhood,

15:49.360 --> 15:52.360
a lot of gang activity
and violence.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.040
Second chord.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.640
They're afraid to even go
out of their homes at night.

16:05.320 --> 16:10.080
They are leaning on each other
as a second family.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.720

a musical director.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.000
He is a father.

He's a genuine supporter

16:17.720 --> 16:19.960
of everything
that we want to do in life.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.960

- Yeah.
- Why?

16:23.840 --> 16:26.040
Aww.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.400

the reason I do what I do.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.440
They're able to heal
through the music.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.080
We are gonna sing

17:58.080 --> 18:00.520

20:27.040 --> 20:29.160
- My favorite part
of what you guys did

20:29.160 --> 20:30.680
is when you all sung together.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.000
It literally sent chills
down my spine.

20:33.000 --> 20:33.970
It really sounded beautiful.

20:33.970 --> 20:35.360
It really sounded beautiful.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.960
And I could really
get the sense

20:36.960 --> 20:38.480
that you're thoroughly
enjoying it

20:38.480 --> 20:40.280
and you really want this.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.120
So, well done,
congratulations.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.400
- Well, first of all,
I thought that this

20:46.400 --> 20:50.080
was a very smart move,
singing One Direction.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.840
It was fun.
It was exciting,

20:53.840 --> 20:56.760
because normally choirs can be
maybe a little bit boring,

20:56.760 --> 20:59.720
but then you really
blew my mind with this.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
It was amazing.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.280
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

21:03.280 --> 21:03.970
- What I picked up on
when you started

21:03.970 --> 21:05.880
- What I picked up on
when you started

21:05.880 --> 21:11.000
was a lot of nerves.
It was a brave song.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.840
And then,
as you hit the middle,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.840
I suddenly got
what you guys are all about.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.840
I got it.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.560
What you're doing,

21:20.560 --> 21:21.920
I really think
it's important.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.080
I really, really do,

21:23.080 --> 21:26.000
because, look, things in life
are tough at the moment.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.160
But we all try and find things
we're good at doing.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.200
You work as a team.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.520
You work hard.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.840
And then great things happen.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.970
And I think
you're hard workers,

21:33.970 --> 21:34.000
And I think
you're hard workers,

21:34.000 --> 21:35.320
so I like you guys.

21:35.320 --> 21:39.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, thank you.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.720
- Michael.
- Thank you.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.560
- You are also special.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.880
I can tell that.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.120
I think that what you've done
is incredible.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.920
You've got someone really great
leading this, congratulations.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.080
- Thank you so much.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.920
- But now we have to vote.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.960
I'm gonna start with Howie,
yes or no?

21:57.960 --> 22:00.680
- Oh, absolutely yes.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.640
- That's one.
Mel?

22:02.640 --> 22:03.970
- A definitely yes,
hands down.

22:03.970 --> 22:04.440
- A definitely yes,
hands down.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.000
- Thank you.
- That's two. Heidi?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.360
- I give you a yes.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.720
- That's three.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.040

No, you're giving me
a headache now, Tita.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.160
I can't take any more of this.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.040
- But I liked it.
It was kind of goofy and fun.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.320
- Tita, have you been drinking?

29:41.320 --> 29:43.440
- No!

29:43.440 --> 29:45.000

no today, sorry.

29:46.996 --> 29:48.920

no today, sorry.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.960

29:52.160 --> 29:53.920
- So it was kind of fun
for, like, two minutes,

29:53.920 --> 29:56.560
but then it was too much.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.560
It's a no.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.720
- Oh, my God.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.280
Can I have some?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.480
Give some to Daddy.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.520
It's coming.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.040
It's coming, wider.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.160
- Being a dad
definitely changed my life.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.520
- Love you.
- Love you.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.760
- You wake up at 6:00?
- Uh-huh.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.080
- Why do you wake up
so early?

31:06.080 --> 31:08.000
- Because I have four kids.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.240
- My kids make me so proud.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.840
- How old are you?
Tell everybody--one.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.200
- One.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.000
- Do the middle finger thing
I taught you?

31:18.840 --> 31:20.960
- I'm happy I'm doing this
with you.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.000
Aw.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.024
- I was a teen mom
with my little Jazzy here.

31:26.024 --> 31:28.080
- I was a teen mom
with my little Jazzy here.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.600
- This is your daughter?
- Yeah.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.200
- Oh, I thought you were, like,
brother or sisters.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.720
- No.
- Oh, wow.

31:33.720 --> 31:37.440
- Yeah, teen mom, and we
kind of grew up together.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.080
- Right.
My mom was a teen mom.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.080
I know what it's like.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.240
Go get 'em.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.880
- And who are you?

31:48.880 --> 31:51.400
- I am Nikki Edgar.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.400
- And this is?
- This is my husband, Ryan.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.024
And this is my daughter,
Jaslyn.

31:56.024 --> 31:56.920
And this is my daughter,
Jaslyn.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.520
- Your daughter?
- Yes.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.640
- No.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.960
- Wow.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.800
- And, yeah, we're
a modern-day family band.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.800
- And how did this
all come about?

32:06.800 --> 32:09.800
- Well, we've had the failed
record deals and the things...

32:09.800 --> 32:12.000
- When did you have
the record deal?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.160
- I was a Christian artist,

32:13.160 --> 32:14.960
and I ended up getting pregnant

32:14.960 --> 32:18.480
and being a teen mom
within that.

32:18.480 --> 32:22.320
So they kicked me out
of the industry, pretty much.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.024
I grew up singing
with my family in church.

32:26.024 --> 32:29.160
I grew up singing
with my family in church.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.120
And when I was 13 years old,

32:31.120 --> 32:32.400
I was in a singing contest

32:32.400 --> 32:35.400
that was through a local
Christian radio station.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.680
It was within a year
that I had a record deal.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.200
I was doing arena tours,
traveling all over,

32:41.200 --> 32:44.200
singing for 100, 000 people.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.360
I met a guy,
and it progressed

32:47.360 --> 32:49.640
kind of quickly
and before I knew it,

32:49.640 --> 32:53.080
I found out
that I was pregnant.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.680
Pretty much immediately,

32:54.680 --> 32:56.024
stores were taking
my records off the shelves,

32:56.024 --> 32:56.800
stores were taking
my records off the shelves,

32:56.800 --> 33:00.000
and radio stations were taking
all of my songs off the air.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.080
I went from touring the country
to being completely rejected.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.160
That was one of the lowest
points of my life.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.080
When Jas was born,
she was a huge light

33:13.080 --> 33:15.080
in a really dark situation.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.560
- Growing up, I remember
singing with her

33:17.560 --> 33:19.280
and dancing with her.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.760
And she always made sure
I was happy, no matter what.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.024
She really--
she really is my hero.

33:26.024 --> 33:27.560
She really--
she really is my hero.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.040
- I mean, what more
do you want

33:29.040 --> 33:31.280
than to give
your kids everything?

33:31.280 --> 33:33.720
Jeez.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.440
And then I met Ryan,

33:35.440 --> 33:38.520
and he was this
missing link for us.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.080
- Getting to adopt Jaslyn,
I'm just blessed.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.440
- I think we all
are like a puzzle.

33:43.440 --> 33:44.920
We're all a certain piece,

33:44.920 --> 33:47.000
and we can't do it
without each other.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.720
- It's like I'm back
on the journey

33:48.720 --> 33:50.160
that I started on,

33:50.160 --> 33:55.000
and it's just so amazing
to be doing it with my family.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.840
It's a real happy beginning.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.560
- Okay, well, look,
the good thing

34:03.560 --> 34:05.800
about shows like this,
you get an opportunity

34:05.800 --> 34:08.960
to prove these people
have made a mistake, right?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.880
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.680
- Okay, well,
best of luck, the three of you.

your daughter and your husband

36:18.280 --> 36:21.200
has just made it even more
beautiful, that sound.

36:21.200 --> 36:24.160
So thank you for that.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.920

you were harmonizing.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.080
- You know, it's--
your story is a very common one.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.840
You got pregnant,

36:39.840 --> 36:43.280
and then changing your life
and walking away from a career.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.120
But, ultimately,
as tough as that is,

36:46.120 --> 36:49.720
I think tonight you have
just given birth

36:49.720 --> 36:51.280
to a second chance.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.400

36:59.400 --> 37:01.200

37:01.200 --> 37:03.080
to kind of bring

37:07.080 --> 37:08.840

thank you.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.720

37:11.720 --> 37:13.200

Oh, whoa!

39:02.560 --> 39:03.800
- My name is Gary Sladek.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.120
I'm 57 years old.

39:05.120 --> 39:09.160
I am America's oldest daredevil
acrobatic hand-balancer.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.160
- Sladek, what you gonna do
for us today?

39:12.160 --> 39:15.160
- I will risk my life
for "America's Got Talent."

39:15.160 --> 39:16.480
It's a solo act,

39:16.480 --> 39:18.520
with my little brother
as my assistant.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.560
I grew up
in North Babylon, New York.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.280
It was middle-class families,

39:23.280 --> 39:25.080
when neighborhoods
used to be neighborhoods,

39:25.080 --> 39:26.935
and everybody knew each other.

39:26.935 --> 39:27.160
and everybody knew each other.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.760
My best friend Jeffrey and I,

39:28.760 --> 39:31.480
we used to take the mattresses
off the bed,

39:31.480 --> 39:32.640
put them in the back yard,

39:32.640 --> 39:33.720
and we'd start off

39:33.720 --> 39:35.000
on the other side of the street,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.720
and we run across the street,
flip onto the mattresses.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.560
So I fell in love
with gymnastics.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.560
And almost 38 years later,

39:41.560 --> 39:43.920
here I am
on "America's Got Talent."

39:43.920 --> 39:46.040
- This is that moment.
- This is it.

39:46.040 --> 39:50.040
- Nobody in America is doing
what I do at my age.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.760
- ♪ Trying hard now ♪

39:52.760 --> 39:55.040
- I really shouldn't
be doing it at my age,

39:55.040 --> 39:56.080
but it comes from my heart.

39:56.080 --> 39:56.935
I mean, it's my passion.

39:56.935 --> 39:57.480
I mean, it's my passion.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.880

I mean, it's what I do.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.200
- Go get 'em.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.120
- Wow.
- Man, hello.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.400
- Hello.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.760
- That's a nice-looking
onesie.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.120
- Well, thanks.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.240
- What's your name?
- Gary Sladek,

40:16.240 --> 40:18.880
AKA the Amazing Sladek.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.840
- Okay, Amazing,
where you from?

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
- I'm from North Babylon,
New York.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.200
- Sladek from New York.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.935
- I am a daredevil
hand-balancer,

40:26.935 --> 40:27.120
- I am a daredevil
hand-balancer,

40:27.120 --> 40:30.080

oldest daredevil hand-balancer.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.080
- How old are you?

40:31.080 --> 40:33.120
- I'll be 58 in July.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.440
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, wow.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.640
- So what was your background?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.920
What did you do all your life?

40:36.920 --> 40:38.600
- I come from a theater family.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.320
The real star of the show
is my little brother

40:40.320 --> 40:41.600
Broadway Jim backstage.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.840
He's my assistant tonight.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.200
That's the real talent
in the family.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.080
- Also looks like a New Yorker.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.080
All right, you ready?

40:48.080 --> 40:49.040
- Yes, sir.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.320
- Then go do what you do.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.000
- Okay.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.800
Here's the mic.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.400
- Oh, my God,
this is hilarious.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.400
- Do not try this at home.

41:42.440 --> 41:47.880
- Oh, my God!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.360
What?

41:49.360 --> 41:51.200
- Christ.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.040
- Oh, my God.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.080
I don't like this.

42:47.280 --> 42:49.280
- Come on, come on, come on.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.960
- Ah-ah-ah!

43:11.200 --> 43:13.200
- This is so dangerous.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.880
- Now how is he gonna get down?

43:32.440 --> 43:34.760
This really makes me feel sick.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.040
- Oh, my God.

43:38.040 --> 43:41.240
I can't watch.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.400
- Oh, God.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.800
- No more, no more!

43:44.800 --> 43:47.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:56.000 --> 43:56.935
- I can't, I can't.

43:56.935 --> 43:58.280
- I can't, I can't.

44:26.920 --> 44:26.935
- Incredible.

44:26.935 --> 44:27.920
- Incredible.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.840
Has that ever
gone wrong before?

44:33.360 --> 44:34.880
- 38 years.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.040
- Seriously?

44:36.040 --> 44:38.320
- This is the, "Oh, my
goodness," of my life right now.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.240
- Well, it was an, "Oh, my
goodness," for us as well.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.160
It was amazing,
congratulations.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.960
- Thank you so much,
thank you.

44:43.960 --> 44:45.040
- Heidi?

44:45.040 --> 44:46.600
- The only advice
that I would give:

44:46.600 --> 44:47.880
you need a new outfit,

44:47.880 --> 44:49.720
because this is straight-up
from the '70s,

44:49.720 --> 44:51.680
and it's not working.

44:51.680 --> 44:54.680
- You know...

44:54.680 --> 44:56.080
- Mel?

44:56.080 --> 44:56.935
- Oh, I was on the edge
of my seat.

44:56.935 --> 44:58.520
- Oh, I was on the edge
of my seat.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.640
- So was he.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.560
- And that--stop.

45:02.560 --> 45:05.920
And that's what "America's
Got Talent" is all about.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.880
The whole audience was,
like, silent.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.880
You captured everyone.

45:10.880 --> 45:12.400
It was brilliant.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.520
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, it was.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.560
- Wow.
- It was.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.920
- I'm still checking my pulse.

45:17.920 --> 45:20.440
- You've got so many surprising
things about you.

45:20.440 --> 45:21.640
Number one, your age.

45:21.640 --> 45:24.000
Number two,
where you come from.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.720
It's a wonderful
combination of Americana

45:26.720 --> 45:26.935
and death-defying stunts.

45:26.935 --> 45:28.360
and death-defying stunts.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.400
So you thrilled us all.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.680
We're about to vote.

45:31.680 --> 45:32.920
We'll start with Mel.

45:32.920 --> 45:34.520
- Yes.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.400
- Heidi?
- Yes.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.000
- Simon?
- Yes for me.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
- Four yeses.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.560
- Oh, my goodness.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.120
- We'll see you next time.

45:45.800 --> 45:47.240
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.400
- I mean, that was hard.
- Yeah.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.360
- That moment, you said
it was the biggest moment.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.240
- It's the biggest.
This is it.

45:56.240 --> 45:56.935
- This is it.
- "AGT."

45:56.935 --> 45:57.720
- This is it.
- "AGT."

45:57.720 --> 45:59.360
- It's the, "Oh, my goodness,"
of my life.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.520
All four judges, Ma, Pop.

46:01.520 --> 46:05.120
All four judges are passing us
on to the next round.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.000
- Whoo, ha-ha!

46:06.000 --> 46:08.160
Yeah!

46:08.160 --> 46:10.920
- Congratulations, kiddo.
- Thanks, Pop.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.720
- Wow.
You really look nice.

46:20.720 --> 46:22.120
- Thank you, darling.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.800
- ♪ Oh, yeah ♪

46:25.800 --> 46:27.280

I mean, the goatee is nice.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.280
- Got nothing in my teeth?
- Nothing's in your teeth.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.040
- All right, we're good.
- The mustache looks good, man.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.000
- ♪ Oh, oh ♪

46:32.000 --> 46:33.680

46:36.400 --> 46:39.160
It's you, Mel B.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.920
- God, I look good this season.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.160
- Girl, you got to make sure
when you come here,

46:42.160 --> 46:44.972
girl, you got to look

46:44.972 --> 46:45.000
girl, you got to look

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000

46:47.720 --> 46:49.960

46:56.160 --> 46:58.680
- Ay, papi, you're looking good,
man, looking nice.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.160
- Ooh.

47:03.160 --> 47:04.520
- We're eight guys
from Argentina,

47:04.520 --> 47:07.040
- and we're called...
- Malevo.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.720
- Malevo.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.080
What is Malevo
gonna do today?

47:13.080 --> 47:14.960
- We're gonna rock
out there, man.

47:14.960 --> 47:14.972
- ♪ Oh, yeah ♪

47:14.972 --> 47:16.120
- ♪ Oh, yeah ♪

47:16.120 --> 47:18.880
- We are the "Magic Mike"
of Argentina.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.080
Our signature look
starts with our boots,

47:21.080 --> 47:22.480
our tight pants,

47:22.480 --> 47:26.080
our open shirts,
and especially our hair.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.800
See what I mean?

47:28.800 --> 47:29.880
- Yeah, you could--

47:29.880 --> 47:32.920
Oh, you got it in my eye!
You got in my eye.

47:34.360 --> 47:36.120
- Life is very hard
in Argentina.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.600
We grew up
in a lot of poverty.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.720
Some don't even have
electricity, don't have water.

47:39.720 --> 47:41.000
We have to make ends meet.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.760
So one of us
is a carpenter,

47:42.760 --> 47:44.320
another one
works in construction,

47:44.320 --> 47:44.972
and we have
a gas station attendant.

47:44.972 --> 47:46.160
and we have
a gas station attendant.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.200
But this is what we feel like
we should be doing.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.160
headlining in Vegas.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.000
That would be
our ultimate dream.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.920
- It's about
to get dangerous.

47:54.920 --> 47:56.880
Drums, leather boots,
and whips.

47:56.880 --> 47:57.920
- Yes, sir.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.040
- That's what
I'm talking about.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.960
Go get 'em, guys!

48:05.120 --> 48:06.840
- They're cute.

48:06.840 --> 48:09.400
- Ooh.
This one's pumped.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.680
- Hi, who are you guys?

48:13.680 --> 48:14.972
- We are Malevo.
We are from Argentina.

48:14.972 --> 48:15.880
- We are Malevo.
We are from Argentina.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.240
- Malevo.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.920
Will you tell us
how you met?

48:19.920 --> 48:22.040
- Well, we've been together
since we were little kids.

48:22.040 --> 48:27.280
And we've known each other
since maybe 20 years.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.760
- And what are you doing
for us today?

48:28.760 --> 48:30.160
- We're gonna do some malambo.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.320
This is a rhythm from Argentina
that the gauchos used to do,

48:33.320 --> 48:34.880
and we're bringing it back.

48:34.880 --> 48:37.200
- Okay, I can't wait to hear it.
I wish you good luck.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.480
- Thank you.

48:43.480 --> 48:44.972
- Uno, dos, tres...

48:44.972 --> 48:45.040
- Uno, dos, tres...

48:46.760 --> 48:48.000
- Ooh.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.800
- Oh, my gosh,
I love it.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.440
- These guys are good.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.640
- I'm scared.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.080
Malevo.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.280
Malevo!

50:32.560 --> 50:34.080
- Simon, what did you think?

50:34.080 --> 50:35.760
- I thought that was incredible.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.000
Really.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.880
- Thank you.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.160
- If there were more of you,

50:40.160 --> 50:43.000
this could be like
Riverdance part two.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.972
- Yeah, I was gonna say that.
- Thank you.

50:44.972 --> 50:45.320
- Yeah, I was gonna say that.
- Thank you.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.840
- I thought, as an act,
it was exciting,

50:47.840 --> 50:51.240
memorable, different.
I loved it.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.000
- My God, I mean,
you were men up there,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.560
Like, full-on powerhouse men.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.000
I loved it.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.200
- I loved it too.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.320
I love all your shirts
that are unbuttoned.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.400
You all look very hot.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.560
It was very exciting.

51:05.560 --> 51:06.560
I loved it.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.000
I can't wait to see this again.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.160
- Thank you.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.920
- Having been on the show
for years,

51:12.920 --> 51:14.972
it's hard to impress us.

51:14.972 --> 51:15.080
it's hard to impress us.

51:15.080 --> 51:18.200
That being said,
we are all so impressed.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.720
- Okay, we're gonna
have to vote.

51:22.720 --> 51:25.000
Howie.
- I love what you did.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.760
I'm gonna give you a yes.

51:29.440 --> 51:32.040
- Mel.
- Oh, definite yes from me.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.880
You were great.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.240
- It's a sí for me.

51:37.240 --> 51:39.520
- And I'm gonna give you
your fourth yes.

at some acts that earned
their place in the next round.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.160
Check it out.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.280
- All men should know
how to do this kind of stuff.

52:42.280 --> 52:44.160
- I could not take
my eyes off you.

52:44.160 --> 52:44.972
- You really
blew my mind with this.

52:44.972 --> 52:46.520
- You really
blew my mind with this.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.480
- That's what "America's
Got Talent" is all about.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.440
- Ugh!

52:54.440 --> 52:56.640
- It's not how many times
you get knocked down.

52:56.640 --> 52:58.120
It's how many times you get up.

53:05.882 --> 53:08.920
- They either want to be wowed
or a big belly laugh.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.760
- I want a big belly laugh
or want to be wowed.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.040
- Oh, big belly laugh.

53:13.040 --> 53:16.000
- That is actually
not a bad accent.

53:17.720 --> 53:20.320
- Comedy is hard
for "America's Got Talent."

53:20.320 --> 53:21.800
- They need
to laugh, laugh, laugh,

53:21.800 --> 53:23.160
or they think
you're horrible.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.760
- You're a comedian,
I'm a comedian.

53:24.760 --> 53:25.800
- We're both comics.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.400
- There's a kinship;
I feel it already.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.080
- So how long you been
doing comedy for?

53:29.080 --> 53:31.640
- I kind of just
wrote my act in line.

53:31.640 --> 53:33.360
- Oh, boy.

53:33.360 --> 53:34.048
- My name is Danny Palumbo.

53:34.048 --> 53:35.000
- My name is Danny Palumbo.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.200
I'm 30 years old,
and I'm a standup comedian.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.400
I'm young in comedy,

53:38.400 --> 53:40.000
but I still have
to work a day job

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
to supplement the comedy,

53:41.000 --> 53:42.400
so I picked up
a bartending gig

53:42.400 --> 53:45.000
at a seafood restaurant.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.880
This is the most people I've
performed in front of, I think.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.400
- Really?
- Yeah, this place is huge.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.480
I'm excited
for this opportunity.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.960
We'll find out if I'm ready.
I think so.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.360
You just have to go do it
and find out.

53:58.880 --> 54:00.080
My goodness.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.520
- Hi, what's your name?

54:01.520 --> 54:03.040
- My name is Danny Palumbo.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.048
- And where are you from?
- Austin, Texas.

54:04.048 --> 54:05.640
- And where are you from?
- Austin, Texas.

54:05.640 --> 54:08.440
- comedian.
- How'd you know?

54:08.440 --> 54:10.920
- I don't know,
it's just that look.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.360
- What was your worst gig?

54:12.360 --> 54:13.600
- I had a show
at a bar one time,

54:13.600 --> 54:16.000
and I had a guy ask me
for a pillow, so...

54:18.120 --> 54:20.960
- Because he wanted to sleep
or suffocate you with it?

54:20.960 --> 54:23.320
- I'm gonna say sleep,
'cause I'm not that morbid.

54:23.320 --> 54:26.600
But, you know, maybe.

54:26.600 --> 54:27.960
- Okay, well, you know what,

54:27.960 --> 54:29.480
I'm just gonna turn
the stage over to you.

54:29.480 --> 54:30.560
It's yours, go for it.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.040
- Thank you so much.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.800
This is a big deal for me,

54:35.800 --> 54:38.720
so I tried
calling my mom today.

54:38.720 --> 54:44.480
She didn't answer... again.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.120
I realized today
that I call my mother

54:46.120 --> 54:47.320
way more than she calls me.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.920
So, like, I don't know,
what do I do?

54:48.920 --> 54:52.000
Start playing it cool?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.040
Give it a couple days, maybe?

54:53.040 --> 54:54.200
I don't know.

54:54.200 --> 54:58.480
Maybe we should
go back to texting for a while?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.160
- That hurts my feelings.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.120
All right.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.960
I'm gonna keep going.

55:14.960 --> 55:16.920
My mom will do that weird thing
where, like,

55:16.920 --> 55:18.160
we'll be on the phone,

55:18.160 --> 55:20.000
and five seconds
into the conversation,

55:20.000 --> 55:24.480
she'll be like,
"All right, well..."

55:24.480 --> 55:27.760
I'm like, "Are you trying to get
me off the phone right now?"

55:27.760 --> 55:30.040
Like,
that's not how this works.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.640
That's it, I'm out.

55:33.760 --> 55:34.048
- Okay, let's be kind.

55:34.048 --> 55:36.240
- Okay, let's be kind.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.600
Here's the thing.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.400
When it's going bad,
you got to play into that.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.880
You got to be witty.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.240
You got to work on your feet.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.280
You can't just stick
to your material.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.200
You can't let this throw you.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.440
You got to work with it.

55:49.440 --> 55:52.080
- Part of the fun with an
audience like this is,

55:52.080 --> 55:54.680
it's a game, you know?
- Right.

55:54.680 --> 55:56.640
- And you just
didn't go with it.

55:56.640 --> 55:59.080
But you have to chalk this one
up for experience.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.480
- Obviously it's a no.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.080
- That's okay.
- Sorry, Danny.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.080
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

56:03.080 --> 56:04.048
- Thank you.
- That was painful.

56:04.048 --> 56:04.960
- Thank you.
- That was painful.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.400
- I know.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.920
- There is nothing more painful

56:08.920 --> 56:10.320
than watching somebody--

56:10.320 --> 56:14.040
a comedian
go down in flames.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.440
- I was very surprised.

56:16.440 --> 56:20.920
But all right, well...
I'm gonna get out of here.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.120
All right, bye.

56:24.760 --> 56:25.960
Whew.

56:25.960 --> 56:28.680
- All right, D. J.,
you're up, come on.

56:34.360 --> 56:35.560
- Hi.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.040
What's your name,
and where you from?

56:37.040 --> 56:41.000
- My name is D. J. Demers,
and I'm from Canada.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.520
- D. J. from Canada.

56:43.520 --> 56:46.000
And how old are you,
D. J. from Canada?

56:46.000 --> 56:47.640
- I do standup comedy.

56:47.640 --> 56:48.880
- No, how old are you?

56:48.880 --> 56:50.160
- Well, I am 30,

56:50.160 --> 56:52.360
so that was not the correct
answer at all to your question,

56:52.360 --> 56:54.880
but then...
I also wear a hearing aid,

56:54.880 --> 56:56.360
so that's why
I didn't hear you right.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.080
- Oh, you do, okay.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.320
- Yeah, so I wear
a hearing aid.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.600
I'm from Canada.
Two disabilities, so...

57:01.600 --> 57:04.040
- Stop.

57:04.040 --> 57:04.048
- Sorry, Howie, I had to.

57:04.048 --> 57:05.320
- Sorry, Howie, I had to.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.160
I've always wanted
to be a comedian.

57:11.160 --> 57:14.800
And I always remember,
as a kid, having a joke ready.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.760
But I knew very early on
it would be a challenge.

57:17.760 --> 57:20.080
I have a very profound
hearing loss.

57:20.080 --> 57:23.040
My parents discovered it
when I was 4 years old.

57:23.040 --> 57:26.160
They realized I wasn't
responding to things,

57:26.160 --> 57:28.200
so they took me to a doctor,

57:28.200 --> 57:32.240
and I've been wearing
a hearing aid since that day.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.048
Growing up, I think that comedy
and making my friends laugh

57:34.048 --> 57:35.880
Growing up, I think that comedy
and making my friends laugh

57:35.880 --> 57:39.480
was probably a way for me
to connect with people

57:39.480 --> 57:43.280
and be something other
than a boy with hearing aids.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.720
- Comic--how long
you been doing it?

57:44.720 --> 57:46.000
- Seven years.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.920
- I've been going
to open mic nights.

57:48.920 --> 57:51.120
I know in my heart
this is what I want to do.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.160
And I try to learn something
from every gig.

57:55.160 --> 57:56.920
I'm here at
"America's Got Talent"

57:56.920 --> 58:00.160
because I've always had
grand ambitions

58:00.160 --> 58:02.160
and when I step out
on that stage tonight,

58:02.160 --> 58:04.048
I'm really gonna try
to just appreciate

58:04.048 --> 58:04.080
I'm really gonna try
to just appreciate

58:04.080 --> 58:05.240
where I've been so far,

58:05.240 --> 58:09.080
and hopefully where this journey
can continue to take me.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.120
- So, listen,
this is your stage.

58:14.120 --> 58:18.160
Make us laugh.
- Thank you.

58:18.160 --> 58:20.040
I said I wear a hearing aid,

58:20.040 --> 58:23.400
so I watch all my movies
and TV shows

58:23.400 --> 58:24.800
with the subtitles on.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.120
My favorite
is when the subtitle says,

58:27.120 --> 58:29.120
"indistinct chatter."

58:29.120 --> 58:33.520
Oh, thank God,
it's not just me, then.

58:33.520 --> 58:34.048
That was indistinct
for everybody? Great.

58:34.048 --> 58:36.720
That was indistinct
for everybody? Great.

58:36.720 --> 58:39.480
Me and my partner
actually recently broke up.

58:39.480 --> 58:40.760
Aw.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.040
- Thank you, thanks.

58:44.040 --> 58:46.600
But...

58:46.600 --> 58:48.800
Got really quiet
in here for a second.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.400
Or did it?
No, it did; I heard that.

58:52.400 --> 58:56.880
The hearing aid, yeah.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.400
No, I know why it got quiet,
though, right?

58:58.400 --> 59:00.360
It's 'cause I said "partner."

59:00.360 --> 59:02.960
As soon as somebody
says "partner"

59:02.960 --> 59:04.048
and you don't
know them well...

59:04.048 --> 59:06.600
and you don't
know them well...

59:06.600 --> 59:09.280
you can't even focus
on the rest of the conversation.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.120
You're just...

59:11.120 --> 59:12.640
Trying to solve the mystery.

59:12.640 --> 59:15.000
Hmm...

59:15.000 --> 59:17.560
Partner, huh?

59:17.560 --> 59:19.760
You're all looking at me trying
to crack the case right now.

59:19.760 --> 59:23.280
I can feel it.
- Yeah, we are.

59:23.280 --> 59:26.000
- You're like,
"Well, he's kind of got a lisp,

59:26.000 --> 59:27.440
"but that could be
the hearing impairment.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.720
I don't know."

59:33.040 --> 59:34.048
"Don't know what
to attribute that to."

59:34.048 --> 59:36.080
"Don't know what
to attribute that to."

59:36.080 --> 59:39.280
No, me and--
me and my girlfriend broke up,

59:39.280 --> 59:41.080
to clear up that mystery.

59:41.080 --> 59:43.080
Thank you.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.160
'Cause I realized
I was gay.

59:45.160 --> 59:48.000
But...

59:48.000 --> 59:50.800
Thank you very much, guys.
Thank you.

59:53.800 --> 59:55.400
Thank you.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.920
- Oh, I didn't want
that to finish.

59:58.920 --> 1:00:00.120
But can I ask you,

1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:03.560
'cause I actually
do want to know, are you gay?

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:04.048
- Uh, no.

1:00:04.048 --> 1:00:05.280
- Uh, no.

1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:06.360
- Really?

1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:07.840
- But my boyfriend is.

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:11.120
- No, no, he's not gay either.

1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:12.680
We're just having a good time,
but, um...

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:19.680
- Funny dude.

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:22.160
- Oh, I love this guy.

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:23.400
- You know something?

1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:25.440
You are far beyond your years
in the ability

1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:26.600
and your comfort level.

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:28.920
You found the humor
in the reality

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:31.480
of who you are and what you're
doing, what we're thinking.

1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:33.280
And up till now,
this season,

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:34.048
as far as comedy goes,
you're my favorite.

1:00:34.048 --> 1:00:35.640
as far as comedy goes,
you're my favorite.

1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:38.320
- That means so much coming
from you, Howie, thank you.

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:40.040
- I just want to say,
I always sit here,

1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:41.320
and Simon always says,

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:42.760
"Oh, Mel B. just wants
a belly laugh.

1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:44.080
She wants a belly laugh."

1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:46.400
But let me tell you, you gave me
more than a belly laugh.

1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:48.320
Seriously, Heidi,
what did you think?

1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:49.560
- Well, in the beginning,

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.120
in the very, very,
very beginning,

1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:52.440
I thought, oh, my God,
this is a little slow.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:53.880
But then it was the punch line.

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:56.040
Then I was laughing,
and it was hilarious.

1:00:56.040 --> 1:00:58.040
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, Heidi.

1:00:58.040 --> 1:00:59.880
- Simon.
- Thank you.

1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:01.680
- Yeah, you know
what it is, D. J.?

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:03.240
I think we all felt comfortable,

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:04.048
because it is actually very,
very difficult sitting here

1:01:04.048 --> 1:01:06.120
because it is actually very,
very difficult sitting here

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:08.080
when someone's trying
to be funny and they're not.

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:10.040
- Oh, it's horrible.
- I find it really embarrassing.

1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:14.320
- But actually, you're funny,
original, likeable.

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:16.040
- Thank you,
thank you very much.

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:17.600
- People are gonna
root for you.

1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:18.880
- You did well.

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:20.000
- Thank you, guys.

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.440
- Okay, well, it's time to vote.

1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:23.600
Howie?
- I'm giving you a yes.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:24.800
- Thank you.

1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:27.160
- I'm also gonna
give you a yes.

1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:29.560
- Simon?

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:30.920
- That's a yes from me.

1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:32.480
- Thanks, Simon.

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:34.048
- And you got your
fourth yes from me.

1:01:34.048 --> 1:01:35.160
- And you got your
fourth yes from me.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:37.000

1:01:58.200 --> 1:01:59.240

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:50.840
- Is my hair good?
- No.

1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:52.080
- It's sticking out again.

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:53.640
- I have had numerous vocations

1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:56.720
and spent 21 years
in the aerospace industry.

1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:58.280
Since I'm retired,

1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:01.640
I pretty much spend
all of my time with my wife.

1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:05.480
We like cruises, and I found
out they had karaoke.

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:06.920
- We got Simon Cowell
out there.

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:08.992
He's a star-maker.
You ready to become a star?

1:03:08.992 --> 1:03:09.040
He's a star-maker.
You ready to become a star?

1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:11.040
- I am.
- This is your moment.

1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:13.160
- I'm singing for Simon tonight.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:17.480
If I were voted to be the next
great act in America...

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:18.640
Thank you.

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:20.440
I would accept that
very willingly,

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:23.160
and I would continue
with my new career

1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:25.400
in music and entertainment.

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:28.040

about 15 years ago.

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:02.800
That's about the time
I started doing karaoke.

1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:05.040
- Before you retired,
what was your job?

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:07.560

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:13.360
- Yes, I was blessed
to be the program manager

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:15.400
for the COSTAR instrument

1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:18.080
that repaired
the Hubble space telescope.

1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:23.680
- That's incredible.
- Thank you.

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:25.240
- Did you go to space?

1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:26.760
- I was a Navy pilot.

1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:29.440
That was far enough into space.

1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:32.000
- Wow.
- Wow.

1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:34.840

1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:37.080
why have you decided
to come on the show this year?

1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:38.992
- Well, this would be
probably a high point

1:04:38.992 --> 1:04:39.400
- Well, this would be
probably a high point

1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:42.120
of my life
and my many careers.

1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:45.120

1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:47.520
- That's so sweet.

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.280

words into your mouth,

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:52.680
we're sort of more important
than the Hubble telescope.

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.080

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:33.280
- We are Elevenplay.

1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:36.680
- One, two, three...
- Five.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.640
- Wow--so, wait.

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:38.731
Now there's 11.

1:13:38.731 --> 1:13:39.920
Now there's 11.

1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:41.040
- Ten.
- Ten.

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:42.560
- And where are you from?

1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:44.560
- We are from Japan.

1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:46.760
- Japan.

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:48.160
- Why "America's Got Talent"?

1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:49.800
Why did you come to our show?

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.760
- To share our performance
with...

1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:56.080
- All of America!
- Oh.

1:13:58.160 --> 1:13:59.240
All right.

1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:00.280
Simon?

1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:03.440
- I think this
is really, really smart.

1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:05.200
I was waiting
for someone to do this.

1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:06.920
- Thank you so much.

1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:08.160
- Really liked it.

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:08.731
Because this is so current,

1:14:08.731 --> 1:14:10.120
Because this is so current,

1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:11.680
and you girls are so good,

1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:13.600
and obviously you guys
are so talented,

1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:16.720
you know, this could be
incredible going forward.

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.000
So I'm really impressed.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.880
- Thank you, guys.

1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.040
- Heidi?

1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:23.040
- I just thought
I was on a different planet.

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:25.000
I kind of zoned out,
forgot about everything,

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.600
and just watched
you beautiful girls

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.120
dance under these drones.

1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:30.080
I've never seen
anything like this before.

1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:31.840
And that's what I love
about "America's Got Talent."

1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:35.120
You just never know
who walks in.

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:37.080
- Thanks a lot.

1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:38.731
- For you guys
to come up with this

1:14:38.731 --> 1:14:38.880
- For you guys
to come up with this

1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:43.240
and actually execute it
so on point was just brilliant.

1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.360
And it looked beautiful,

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:47.160
absolutely beautiful.

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:52.120
- Some of the girls
are very emotional.

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:53.280
Why are you crying?

1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.680
- I'm happy.
- Aw.

1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:56.920
- To be here.

1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:59.040
- Well, I'll tell
you something.

1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:00.800
We are happy

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:03.240
and, for once,
geeky techno guys

1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:04.520
have figured out a way

1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:07.040
to meld with
beautiful female dancers.

1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:13.440
Let's vote.
Mel.

1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:14.640
- Definite yes.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.400
- Heidi.
- I give you a yes.

1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:19.120
- And Simon.
- It's a yes from me.

1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:20.640
- So you have three yeses.

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:23.880

your fourth yes.

1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:59.120
- 12.
- What are you gonna sing?

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.360
- I'm singing an original.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.320
- We gonna find
a star today?

1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:19.040
- Yes.

1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:20.560
- Always looking for a star,

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:22.440
something we haven't
seen before.

1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:28.000
Are you friends?
- Coworkers.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.280
- You ever argue?
- No.

1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:32.280
- I bet you do.
- No.

1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:33.640
- You look guilty again.

1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:36.080
- Look at Simon putting
together another band.

1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:40.640
Look at that.
It's a whole new direction.

1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:40.966
- Do you sing?

1:16:40.966 --> 1:16:41.760
- Do you sing?

1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:45.160
- You're gonna do fine.

1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:47.640
I guarantee you,
you will do fine.

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:48.840
- I'm Grace VanderWaal.

1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:50.680
I'm 12 years old,
and I love to sing.

1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:54.280
I live in New York with my mom,
my dad, my sister,

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:56.520
and my two dogs,

1:16:56.520 --> 1:16:58.040
which I love dearly.

1:16:58.040 --> 1:16:59.040
- What are you looking at?

1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:01.880
- Nick Cannon.
- Nick Cannon?

1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:05.560
- My older sister Olivia is 15,
and she's my best friend.

1:17:05.560 --> 1:17:08.880
She's just very supportive,
and I love it.

1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:10.000
- So excited.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:10.966
- Big hugs?

1:17:10.966 --> 1:17:11.000
- Big hugs?

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:12.360
I want to be a part
of the big hug.

1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:13.440
How are you?

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:15.120
- When Grace was about three,

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:17.000
she actually started
writing music

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.360
just in her mind.

1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.920
She would make up a song
with the wireless microphone.

1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:24.280
- ♪ I'm so blessed
when I'm with you ♪

1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:27.920
♪ I really love you ♪

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:31.080
- I'm trying to set
my expectations very low.

1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:34.320
I've never sang in a crowd
this big before.

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:36.680
And this is just gonna be
so different,

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:39.040
to be, like,
in front of all these people.

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:40.040
- What do you think?

1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:40.966
Let me fix your bow.

1:17:40.966 --> 1:17:41.880
Let me fix your bow.

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:43.240
- I saw Nick Cannon walk by,

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:45.040
and was just like,
"Oh, my gosh!"

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.160
And, like, that was
just one person.

1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:49.080
I don't even know
how I'm gonna do it.

1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:52.880
- Two days ago,
she whispered in my ear,

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.000
"Mom, I'm getting
a little nervous."

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.640
She's only 12
and I'm scared,

1:17:57.640 --> 1:17:59.400
because I want everything
that she does

1:17:59.400 --> 1:18:00.920
to be successful.

1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:03.960

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:10.320

1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:10.966
- Ready to go get 'em?
- Yes.

1:18:10.966 --> 1:18:11.840

- Yes.

1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:13.600

1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:30.840

- What a great personality.

1:22:58.960 --> 1:22:59.960
- Can't believe it.

1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:01.360
- You still have
confetti in your hair.

1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:02.840
- I do?
- Yeah.

1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:04.400
- You hear Simon Cowell
make a prediction

1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:06.360
that you're
the next Taylor Swift?

1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:09.960
- Can I get your autograph?

1:23:09.960 --> 1:23:10.966
- Do you think you've
got a star now?

1:23:10.966 --> 1:23:11.040
- Do you think you've
got a star now?

1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:12.560
- I 100% think
we've got a star.

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:14.040
- Amazing.
- Wow.

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:15.240
- Yeah, I really do.
- That is a big wow.

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.120
- This girl is special.
- She is special.

1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:20.520
- And I'm now annoyed I didn't
press the golden button.

1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:21.640
- I know, me too.

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:24.120
- You were amazing.
Oh, my gosh.

1:23:24.120 --> 1:23:28.480
- I'm never getting rid of this
in my entire life.
