18:49.369 --> 18:51.647
I mean, do they even
have libraries anymore?

18:51.682 --> 18:53.270
Hasn't she heard
of the internet?

18:53.304 --> 18:54.857
Come on man, look at her.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.895
A strong breeze
could knock her down.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.862
Take it to her, come on!

18:59.897 --> 19:02.555
- Center stage ladies!

19:02.589 --> 19:03.763
- Let's go, some on.

19:07.007 --> 19:07.870
- Hi.

19:09.286 --> 19:10.563
I'm Anna.

19:10.597 --> 19:12.254
- Carol, nice to meet you.

19:12.289 --> 19:12.979
- You too.

19:13.013 --> 19:14.774
- Oh, so sweet.

19:14.808 --> 19:17.294
Maybe you guys could
be friends later?

19:17.328 --> 19:18.812
All right, you heard the rules.

19:18.847 --> 19:20.987
You go with that.

19:21.021 --> 19:22.195
- Good luck.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.266
- Yeah, you too Anna.
- Okay.

19:24.301 --> 19:26.786
- [Bear] Okay,
fighters, are you ready?

19:26.820 --> 19:28.822
And fight!

19:28.857 --> 19:31.618
[women shouting]

19:32.585 --> 19:33.551
- Make a fist!

19:36.313 --> 19:37.176
Swing!

19:39.247 --> 19:39.937
At her!

19:41.835 --> 19:42.905
Make a fist!

19:42.940 --> 19:45.943
- Fight, fight, fight, fight!

19:45.977 --> 19:47.427
- Hey, what's that?

19:47.462 --> 19:48.394
- What?

19:48.428 --> 19:50.810
[Carol growls]

19:55.332 --> 19:56.505
- Oh no!
- Ooh!

19:59.025 --> 20:00.337
- Tap out!

20:00.371 --> 20:01.269
Are you gonna tap out?

20:01.303 --> 20:02.891
- What does tap out mean?

20:04.306 --> 20:07.378
[slow rushing winds]

20:09.794 --> 20:12.556
[women shouting]

20:16.870 --> 20:17.906
- Anna!

20:18.734 --> 20:20.253
Anna!

20:20.288 --> 20:22.013
My name is Dr. Park.

20:22.048 --> 20:23.532
Do you know where you are?

20:25.327 --> 20:26.017
- Hell.

20:27.295 --> 20:28.813
I'm in hell.

20:28.848 --> 20:31.022
I'm guessing I lost, huh?
[bodies thudding]

20:31.057 --> 20:33.542
- Poland put up a bigger
fight in World War II.

20:33.577 --> 20:34.819
- Yeah, but at least you fought.

20:34.854 --> 20:36.752
It took a lot of courage.

20:36.787 --> 20:38.858
- I guess I can cross
that off my bucket list.

20:40.515 --> 20:41.930
And then puke in that bucket.

20:44.829 --> 20:47.729
I thought only women
were allowed in here?

20:47.763 --> 20:49.903
- Dr. Roy is a special case,

20:49.938 --> 20:51.802
and he's Bear's brother.

20:51.836 --> 20:54.563
Your sister's name is Bear Park?

20:54.598 --> 20:56.565
- Trust me, no one's
ever teased her about it.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.463
- Roy!

20:58.118 --> 20:59.465
Roy!

20:59.499 --> 21:00.328
We got a girl
that's got a little

21:00.362 --> 21:01.087
problem with her ear.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.502
- [Roy] What kind of problem?

21:02.537 --> 21:04.435
- [Bear] It was just
removed from her head.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.886
[techno music]

21:08.094 --> 21:11.994
[gate clanks]

21:18.863 --> 21:21.970
- Still don't understand why
you'd bring me to this place.

21:22.004 --> 21:24.524
- Dude, just show her.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.873
- Show me what?

21:28.908 --> 21:31.428
- Welcome to the Bear cave.

21:31.462 --> 21:32.981
- Wow!

21:33.015 --> 21:36.018
Well this is much cozier than
the Roman Coliseum out there.

21:40.437 --> 21:41.438
What?

21:42.128 --> 21:43.302
Is that?

21:46.097 --> 21:47.996
Is that, that's Mom.

21:48.962 --> 21:51.655
- Yup, she was a goddamn legend.

21:53.864 --> 21:54.934
- Legend?

21:54.968 --> 21:56.867
[slow paced music]

21:56.901 --> 21:58.696
What the hell is going on?

21:58.731 --> 22:00.526
- [Charleen] This
might help explain.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.529
Come on, sit down.

22:05.876 --> 22:08.637
[women shouting]

22:11.571 --> 22:14.125
[women grunting]

22:16.507 --> 22:17.853
- Mom fought here?

22:17.888 --> 22:19.407
- She didn't just fight here,

22:19.441 --> 22:21.961
she was the founder
of this whole club.

22:25.585 --> 22:27.725
- This is Mary's last fight.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.624
The cancer took her
six months later.

22:32.523 --> 22:34.111
I made this as a tribute,

22:34.145 --> 22:35.975
so Mary could know how
much she meant to us.

22:36.009 --> 22:37.942
<i>- When I needed an
emotional release,</i>

22:37.977 --> 22:39.288
<i>I used to scream into my pillow.</i>

22:39.323 --> 22:42.913
<i>This club is my new way of
screaming real fucking loud!</i>

22:42.947 --> 22:46.744
<i>- This club truly gives me
a place to express my rage.</i>

22:46.779 --> 22:47.676
<i>Thanks Mary.</i>

22:47.711 --> 22:49.091
<i>- Everything scared me in life.</i>

22:49.126 --> 22:51.887
<i>But now that I face down real
hurt and pain in this ring,</i>

22:51.922 --> 22:54.959
<i>nothing in the real world
remotely scares me anymore.</i>

22:54.994 --> 22:57.686
<i>- I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.</i>

22:57.721 --> 22:59.757
<i>So, here we go.</i>

23:01.034 --> 23:02.691
<i>Mama Mayor, ah!</i>

23:04.797 --> 23:07.040
<i>Here they come.
[slow gentle music]</i>

23:07.075 --> 23:11.148
<i>This club has allowed
us to share our stories,</i>

23:11.182 --> 23:14.013
<i>to fight it out and
then hug it out.</i>

23:14.047 --> 23:17.948
<i>So thank you for allowing
me to let go of my anger</i>

23:17.982 --> 23:20.537
<i>by letting go of my fist.</i>

23:20.571 --> 23:23.056
<i>But also thank you
for showing me that</i>

23:23.091 --> 23:26.025
<i>underneath this
big, hairy chest,</i>

23:26.991 --> 23:29.097
<i>is an even bigger heart.</i>

23:30.270 --> 23:31.617
<i>Stop looking at me!</i>

23:33.653 --> 23:34.930
<i>Fuck.</i>

23:34.965 --> 23:36.932
<i>- When men punch each
other, it's normal.</i>

23:36.967 --> 23:39.038
<i>We women feel the same way,</i>

23:39.072 --> 23:42.041
<i>but society has house trained
us to cry our shit out.</i>

23:42.075 --> 23:43.076
<i>But thanks to you, Mary,</i>

23:43.111 --> 23:45.182
<i>we get to say, fuck that.</i>

23:45.216 --> 23:47.184
<i>You've helped me and
a lot of other women</i>

23:47.218 --> 23:49.635
<i>to find the strength
to live our truth.</i>

23:49.669 --> 23:52.085
<i>And don't worry, I'll take
care of your baby girl.</i>

23:53.017 --> 23:54.743
<i>- And if you learn to fight,</i>

23:54.778 --> 23:56.780
<i>and you never give
up in the ring,</i>

23:56.814 --> 23:59.058
<i>you will always beat
the shit out of life.</i>

24:00.059 --> 24:04.512
<i>And girls, never back
down from anything.</i>

24:11.173 --> 24:12.036
- Oh.

24:15.074 --> 24:16.765
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

24:18.180 --> 24:19.975
How did she not
tell me about this?

24:21.149 --> 24:23.979
- Therapist-patient
confidentiality.

24:24.014 --> 24:25.947
All of us were your
Mom's patients,

24:26.810 --> 24:28.156
and she was our therapist.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.089
No one was meant to
know about this place.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.161
And sure, there's the new breed

24:33.195 --> 24:35.784
like Olivia who discovered us

24:35.819 --> 24:37.061
and wants to change our ethos,

24:37.096 --> 24:39.823
but Bear and I try
to run this club

24:39.857 --> 24:42.135
like your mother
would have wanted.

24:42.170 --> 24:44.759
And that's why I
brought you here friend,

24:44.793 --> 24:47.175
'cause you need this place
just as much as her patients.

24:47.209 --> 24:51.144
- Oh, you guys, this is crazy.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.181
- I think you owe it to
her to give this a shot.

24:53.215 --> 24:55.839
She created a place
that helped a lot of us.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.948
- I don't even
know how to fight.

25:01.983 --> 25:04.054
It would take a miracle
worker to help me.

25:05.089 --> 25:05.918
[Charleen chuckles]

25:05.952 --> 25:08.230
- I think I may
know just the guy.

[upbeat rock music]
[Charleen laughs]

25:10.060 --> 25:10.992
Eh?

25:14.996 --> 25:15.859
Ooh!

[Anna sighs]

25:20.657 --> 25:25.247
[people chattering]
[indistinct rock singing]

25:27.042 --> 25:28.975
- So embarrassing, God.

25:39.020 --> 25:41.263
- Seriously, that's who
you want to train me?

25:41.298 --> 25:42.161
- [Charleen] Mm-hm.

25:44.025 --> 25:46.268
- This is like the
worst lip-syncing ever.

25:47.407 --> 25:50.652
[men laughing]

25:50.687 --> 25:52.205
How do you know that guy?

25:52.240 --> 25:53.828
- Oh, I arrested
him a few times.

25:53.862 --> 25:55.277
You know, drunk and disorderly,

25:55.312 --> 25:57.245
public nudity,
that sort of thing.

25:57.279 --> 25:58.211
Oh!

25:58.246 --> 25:59.627
[Charleen laughs]

25:59.661 --> 26:01.111
One time he ate
his own underwear

26:01.145 --> 26:02.215
'cause he thought the
cotton fabric would absorb

26:02.250 --> 26:04.217
the alcohol before he
took a breathalyzer test.

26:04.252 --> 26:05.080
- And did it work?

26:05.115 --> 26:05.978
- [Charleen] No!

26:11.673 --> 26:13.192
- Murphy trained
Sugar Ray, you know.

26:13.226 --> 26:16.022
- Who was a world champion in
like five different divisions.

26:16.057 --> 26:17.748
I mean if the man
who trained Sugar Ray

26:17.783 --> 26:19.129
isn't good enough for you,

26:19.163 --> 26:20.958
maybe you should quit
before you begin.

26:20.993 --> 26:21.821
- Oh, okay.

26:21.856 --> 26:22.995
So you're telling me,

26:23.029 --> 26:24.755
I shouldn't judge this
particular book by

26:24.790 --> 26:26.792
its very rum soaked cover?

26:26.826 --> 26:27.896
- Exactly.

26:27.931 --> 26:29.726
I mean, look at you princess.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.382
You are a book that
I wanna take to bed

26:31.417 --> 26:33.902
and read all night long.

26:33.937 --> 26:35.214
- Oh.
- But then you find out

26:35.248 --> 26:37.906
- [Charleen] the books
like dark and depressing,

26:37.941 --> 26:40.288
and currently lacking
a shot at redemption.

26:40.322 --> 26:44.223
So maybe this man could be the
one to change the narrative.

26:46.087 --> 26:47.744
- Hey man, show us your tits!

26:47.778 --> 26:48.641
I got $1!

26:49.711 --> 26:51.782

Oh my God, he's doing it!

26:53.439 --> 26:55.061
He's doing it!

He's doing it!

27:08.281 --> 27:10.076
Shouldn't you call an

27:10.111 --> 27:11.250

27:11.284 --> 27:13.286
That will happen at least
three more times tonight.

their word on that

28:46.586 --> 28:48.519

28:49.520 --> 28:50.418
Ride a bike?

28:50.452 --> 28:51.833
- To fight.

29:24.901 --> 29:29.077
A fight club, that
sounds so dangerous.
