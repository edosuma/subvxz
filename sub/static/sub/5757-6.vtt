WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:05.005
I SPOKE TO HANNA'S MOM
AND SHE SAID THAT SHE
COULD LOOK AFTER YOU.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.607
LOOK AT CARD.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.751
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT IT'S ABOUT MIKE.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.753
HOW WAS THE DINNER PARTY?
IT WAS FINE...

00:19.753 --> 00:21.655
TILL THE COPS SHOWED UP
TO LET US KNOW THAT OUR SON

00:21.655 --> 00:23.557
HAD BEEN ARRESTED
FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.994
I SEE YOU DOING SKETCHY STUFF
AND I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.230
YOU ALREADY KNOW MORE ABOUT ME
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.099
SO WHY CAN'T WE JUST KEEP IT
WHERE IT IS?

00:31.099 --> 00:33.067
A HOCKEY STICK?
PART OF ONE.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.137
AND IT WAS BURIED?
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME OLD JUNK
TILL YOUR DAD SAW IT.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.773
YOU CAN'T BURN THAT.
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT
WITH JUNK I FIND ON MY PROPERTY.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.543
PLEASE.
STOP IT!

00:42.543 --> 00:45.879
LOOK, FROM NOW ON,
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO BE HAPPY,

00:45.879 --> 00:47.315
AND I'D LIKE TO DO THAT HERE.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.049
SO WHO'S JASON?
ALI'S BROTHER.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.952
NO, I KNOW THAT,
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.622
THINGS ARE A LITTLE
TENSE RIGHT NOW
BETWEEN ME AND ISABEL.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.924
NO, YOU'RE STAYING HERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE
WITH MOM.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.927
WE'VE TURNED A CORNER.
STOP USING ME AS AN EXCUSE.

00:59.927 --> 01:04.098
YOU TOOK THINGS FROM EMILY.
YOU BROKE INTO SPENCER'S HOUSE.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.498
YOU STOLE FROM A BLIND GIRL.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.535
I GOT THAT FROM
GARRETT REYNOLDS' APARTMENT.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.539
DO THE POLICE KNOW
WHAT KIND OF WEAPON
THE KILLER USED ON ALISON?

01:11.539 --> 01:13.574
THAT WOULD ALL BE
IN THE CORONER'S REPORT.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.409
SO IT WOULD SAY
WHAT SHE WAS HIT WITH?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.411
ALI'S KILLER IS DEAD.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.922
Hanna:
IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF YOU,
SITTING IN GARRETT'S CAR?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.758
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO MEET HIM.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.794
IT WASN'T LIKE I COULD ASK HIM
THAT STUFF DOWN AT THE PRECINCT.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.763
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY FROM HIM?

01:35.763 --> 01:39.533
WHEN YOU SENT ME THAT TEXT,
I TOLD HIM IT WAS FROM MY MOM.
SHE WANTED ME HOME ASAP.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.535
AM I STILL SHAKING?
I'M STILL SHAKING.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.138
YEAH, WE'RE ALL SHAKING.
CAN YOU TURN ON THE HEAT?

01:44.138 --> 01:46.507
YOU COULD MAKE
A SLUSHY BACK HERE.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.510
GUYS, WHY WOULD JENNA
GIVE HIM THAT LANTERN?

01:49.510 --> 01:51.512
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
SHE GAVE IT TO HIM.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.614
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HE BOUGHT IT
AT THE BLIND ARTISTS'
CRAFTS FAIR?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.316
OF COURSE SHE GAVE IT TO HIM.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.785
THE QUESTION IS,
WHEN DID THEY BECOME BUDDIES?
AND WHY?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.553
SPENCER, THEY GREW UP ACROSS
THE STREET FROM EACH OTHER.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.121
HIS PARENTS
STILL LIVE IN THAT HOUSE.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.056
MAYBE HE'S JUST BRINGING
RAW MEAT TO JENNA'S CAT.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.526
TOBY LIVES THERE, TOO,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A CAT.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.795
THEN MAYBE HE WAS BRINGING OVER
RAW MEAT FOR JENNA.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.398
HERE COMES EM.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.936
WHO'S LIVING
IN HER HOUSE NOW?

02:15.936 --> 02:18.138
SOME LOSERS WHO CAN'T
FIGURE OUT THE ALARM SYSTEM.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.573
THEY'VE TRIPPED IT
LIKE THREE TIMES.

02:19.573 --> 02:23.577
THE SECURITY COMPANY
KEEPS CALLING HER MOM IN TEXAS.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.879
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.849
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD
TO WALK IN THERE AND SEE
OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.652
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TELL 'EM
TO LAY OFF THE ALARM
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.455
I'M GUESSING
THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE.
WELL, THEY WILL NOW.

02:34.455 --> 02:38.992
I'M SURE ARIA'S PARENTS
ARE GONNA HAVE MIKE
ON LOCKDOWN TILL HE TURNS 18.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.561
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT,
HANNA.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.596
WHAT? I'M NOT JUDGING.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.665
I'M JUST GUESSING THAT
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

02:44.665 --> 02:47.768
WILL FIND ANOTHER HOBBY BESIDES
BREAKING AND ENTERING.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.571
STILL TALKING.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.441
GUYS, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY BROTHER.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.843
IF I KNEW,
YOU WOULD KNOW.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.645
EMILY?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.849
ISN'T THAT GARRETT'S CAR?

03:03.050 --> 03:04.184
I THINK IT IS.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.587
WHERE'S HE GOING?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.590
TO HIS PARENTS', I GUESS.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.101
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S GOING INTO JENNA'S HOUSE.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.305
IS TOBY HOME?
NO, HE WENT TO GO GET
HIS PARENTS FROM THE AIRPORT,

03:24.305 --> 03:26.106
AND I THOUGHT HE SAID
JENNA WENT WITH HIM.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.241
HE'S GOING INSIDE.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.310
HE JUST WALKED IN.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.722
CAN YOU WALK ANY SOFTER?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.558
PLEASE, JENNA CAN'T HEAR US.
SHE'S BLIND.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.461
YOU...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.712
( all gasp )

04:12.953 --> 04:14.588
( all gasp )

04:24.164 --> 04:26.467
( all gasp )

04:30.638 --> 04:33.441
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT? *

04:33.441 --> 04:35.843
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE *

04:35.843 --> 04:37.878
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:37.878 --> 04:40.481
* TAKING THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:40.481 --> 04:42.650
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:42.650 --> 04:45.853
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

04:45.853 --> 04:48.188
* 'CAUSE TWO
 CAN KEEP A SECRET *

04:48.188 --> 04:50.558
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

04:55.228 --> 04:57.197
JEEZ, GIVE IT A REST, EM.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.099
I NEED TO WORK ON MY CORE.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.335
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU WERE DOING SIT-UPS
IN YOUR SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.137
I DIDN'T SLEEP.
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.607
BUT WHY BOTHER
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A NIGHTMARE

05:06.607 --> 05:08.876
JUST BY PARKING IN FRONT
OF THE CAVANAUGH HOUSE?

05:08.876 --> 05:10.778
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S GARRETT.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.614
THAT'S WHO JENNA WAS BUYING
THAT LINGERIE FOR.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.883
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOO EARLY.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.051
HERE, HYDRATE.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.287
OH, NOT THAT MUCH.
I HAVE TO WATCH MY SUGAR INTAKE.

05:20.287 --> 05:25.626
WATCH MINE, 'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO HAVE A BIG-ASS BOWL
OF COCOA PUFFS.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.395
ARE YOU ALWAYS LIKE THIS
BEFORE A MEET?

05:27.395 --> 05:30.598
IT'S NOT JUST A MEET.
THE SCOUT FROM DANBY'S COMING.

05:30.598 --> 05:34.768
THIS COULD BE MY LAST CHANCE
TO TURN THIS LIE AROUND
BEFORE IT GETS WORSE.

05:34.768 --> 05:38.238
EM, YOU ONLY LIED
TO YOUR PARENTS.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.841
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING,
THEY'RE IN TEXAS NOW.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.743
MAYBE THE MORE TIME
THAT GOES BY--

05:42.743 --> 05:46.547
THEY'LL FORGET?
IT'S ANOTHER ZIP CODE, HANNA,
NOT A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.683
( groans )
CAN YOU PASS ME MY BAG?

05:59.427 --> 06:02.129
EM, DIDN'T YOU
GET THAT YESTERDAY?

06:02.129 --> 06:03.897
YOU'VE USED A LOT.

06:03.897 --> 06:04.965
IT WORKS.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.702
GOOD MORNING.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.738
OH, HI.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.406
IS THERE ENOUGH COFFEE
FOR, UH...

06:12.406 --> 06:15.876
WELL, I WOULD'VE MADE MORE
IF I KNEW THAT YOU...

06:15.876 --> 06:18.946
THE DECISION TO STAY OVER
WAS SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.716
YOUR MOM AND I STRETCHED
HAPPY HOUR INTO A WHOLE NIGHT,
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO DRIVE.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.718
YEAH, DAD,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.487
YOU USED TO LIVE HERE,
REMEMBER?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.021
( sighs )

06:29.657 --> 06:31.992
MORNING. COME JOIN THE PARTY.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.665
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE ANYWHERE UNTIL 10:00.
YOU WERE GONNA SLEEP IN.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.468
YEAH, WELL,
INTERNAL ALARM CLOCK.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.603
SOME THINGS
YOU JUST CAN'T TURN OFF.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.109
WHAT'S THIS?

06:49.109 --> 06:52.012
YESTERDAY'S MAIL.
IT WAS ON THE MAT
WHEN I CAME HOME LAST NIGHT.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.081
THANKS, EMILY.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.483
THIS IS YOURS.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.086
FANCY.
WHO LIVES IN BALTIMORE?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.157
MY DAD.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.428
I DON'T REMEMBER SENDING THAT.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.664
YOU DIDN'T.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.200
IT'S FROM ISABEL.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.514
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN SIX WEEKS.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.517
SAVE THE DATE.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.768
( knock at door )

07:54.975 --> 07:56.109
HELLO, SPENCER.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.444
HI.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.412
UH, MAY I COME IN?

07:59.412 --> 08:00.948
YEAH, SURE.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.485
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.021
I WAS HOPING TO SEE MELISSA.
IS SHE HERE?

08:08.021 --> 08:10.290
NO, SHE'S BACK IN PHILADELPHIA.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.993
SHE HASN'T REALLY BEEN
BACK MUCH SINCE THE FUNERAL.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.995
YEAH, I WAS HOPING TO ATTEND,
BUT I HADN'T SEEN YOUR PARENTS

08:14.995 --> 08:16.997
SINCE THEY ASKED ME
TO DISAPPEAR.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.200
SO I FIGURED MY PRESENCE
MIGHT BE MORE INCITING
THAN COMFORTING.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.536
SO YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO DROP OFF A PLANT?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.705
WASN'T ACTUALLY OUT OF MY WAY.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.775
I JUST STARTED A ROTATION
AT ROSEWOOD COMMUNITY.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.612
YOU'RE BACK HERE?
FOR SIX MONTHS.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.113
I APPLIED THERE
AS MY NUMBER ONE CHOICE

08:33.113 --> 08:34.514
WHEN I WAS ENGAGED
TO YOUR SISTER.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.583
IT JUST CAME THROUGH.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.686
SOMEBODY UP THERE HAS
A DIVINE SENSE OF IRONY.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.320
( chuckles )

08:40.320 --> 08:41.589
ARE THE PARENTS HOME?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.691
THEY'RE NOT.

08:43.691 --> 08:47.761
UM, HAVE YOU
EVER DONE AN AUTOPSY?

08:47.761 --> 08:51.331
SORRY?
IT'S JUST THIS PROJECT
THAT I HAVE TO DO FOR SCHOOL.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.867
I NEED TO KNOW IF A DOCTOR
CAN LOOK AT A HEAD WOUND

08:53.867 --> 08:57.037
AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
THE WEAPON WAS THAT CAUSED IT.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.707
WHO DOES THE AUTOPSIES
DOWN AT ROSEWOOD COMMUNITY?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.108
THE HOSPITAL'S PATHOLOGIST.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.777
WHERE WOULD HE
KEEP HIS RECORDS?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.979
IN THE MORGUE--
WHERE I MIGHT NAP TODAY
IF I DON'T GET A COFFEE.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.815
DO YOU MIND I HAVE ONE?
I'M KNACKERED.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.883
I'M SORRY, I REALLY NEED
TO GET TO SCHOOL.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.251
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET ME TAKE YOU.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.986
WE COULD STOP
FOR SOMETHING ON THE WAY.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.757
YOU DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY
TO SEE MELISSA, DID YOU?

09:16.757 --> 09:19.526
WHY DON'T WE CONTINUE THIS
OVER COFFEE?

09:19.526 --> 09:22.796
WREN. I HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.297
FINE. HOW ABOUT TEA?

09:26.433 --> 09:29.569
SO WHAT DOES YOUR MOM WANT?
I MEAN, IF YOUR DAD
DITCHES ISABEL, WOULD SHE--

09:29.569 --> 09:32.439
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
THEY. THEM.
THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.042
WHAT TIME IS YOUR MEET?
THREE-THIRTY.
BUT I'M PRACTICING DURING LUNCH.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.577
AND IF I CAN GET OUT
OF SIXTH PERIOD EARLY--
EM, EASY.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.047
YOU'RE ALREADY WEARING
MORE PAIN CREAM THAN CLOTHES.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.915
JUST SAVE SOME MOJO
FOR THE RACE.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.752
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:48.155 --> 09:49.790
WHO'S HE WITH?

09:49.790 --> 09:52.592
ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER,
I GUESS.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.062
WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE.
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.063
OKAY.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.289
CALEB?

10:22.289 --> 10:27.327
HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA BE
DOING THIS ON THE STREET.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.596
HEY, RYAN.
RYAN, WAIT UP.
NO, LET HIM GO.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.432
YOU CANNOT BE DOING BUSINESS--
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, HANNA?

10:32.432 --> 10:34.134
NO MORE LECTURES
ON GOING LEGIT.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.237
I'M NOT TRADING UP FOR
A PAPER HAT AT BENNY'S BURGERS.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.240
THIS IS HOW I MAKE MY MONEY.
GET OVER IT.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.354
HEY THERE.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.524
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

10:57.524 --> 11:01.228
IT'S MY TURN TO TEACH
THE DRIVER'S ED CLASS.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.732
I'M HOPING I CAN SCARE KIDS
INTO WATCHING THE ROAD INSTEAD
OF THEIR CELL PHONES.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.133
FUNNY, RIGHT?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.335
YEAH, THAT'S ACTUALLY
REALLY FUNNY.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.137
I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.273
SPENCER, WE NEVER FINISHED
OUR CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT.
YOU RAN OFF.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.076
I JUST HAVE A LOT OF DRAMA
GOING ON AT MY HOUSE.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.178
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
IT'S FINE.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.280
YOU HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS
AND SOME STRONG IDEAS

11:20.280 --> 11:22.750
ABOUT WEAPONS
AND HEAD WOUNDS--

11:22.750 --> 11:25.853
I KNOW. I CAN GET LIKE THAT.
I'M REALLY SORRY
IF I BOTHERED YOU.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.721
YOU SEEMED PRETTY DISTRAUGHT.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.122
NO. NO, NOT REALLY.

11:29.122 --> 11:32.292
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
THAT I READ IN BIOLOGY

11:32.292 --> 11:34.294
GOT ME THINKING ABOUT
ALI'S AUTOPSY,

11:34.294 --> 11:36.496
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
THE CASE IS CLOSED.

11:36.496 --> 11:40.934
SO THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
I REALLY HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.147
WHAT'S UP, MIKE?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.382
HEY.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.885
SO IS IT TRUE?
WHAT?

11:57.885 --> 12:00.453
IS SMASH-AND-GRAB
YOUR NEW SPORT?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.790
WHAT'S THE DEAL, MAN?

12:02.790 --> 12:05.058
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING ON
NEW PERSONALITIES OR SOMETHING?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.828
THIS WEEK
YOU'RE GONNA BE GANGSTER,
AND NEXT WEEK YOU'RE CRACKHEAD?

12:07.828 --> 12:09.462
BITE ME.
MIKE--

12:09.462 --> 12:10.497
BACK OFF!
HEY!

12:12.265 --> 12:15.202
DON'T YOU GUYS
HAVE A CLASS TO GET TO?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.208
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.742
LATER.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.392
HEY. I SAW YOU
RACE BY MY BUILDING.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.462
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE YOU
WERE COMING TO CAMPUS TODAY.

12:42.462 --> 12:46.800
OH, I HAD TO. IF I DON'T
FINISH THIS THING, IT DOESN'T
GET FIRED TILL NEXT FRIDAY.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.270
HMM. AND HERE I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE AT THE POTTER'S WHEEL

12:50.270 --> 12:55.408
SO I COULD WRAP MY ARMS
 AROUND YOU AND HUM
 UNCHAINED MELODY.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.745
( chuckles )
I'VE SEEN THAT MOVIE.
IT ENDS SADLY.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.881
WELL, WE COULD GIVE IT
A HAPPY ENDING.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.819
CAN WE DO THIS LATER?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.254
YEAH.

13:07.254 --> 13:11.558
UH, HOW'RE THINGS AT HOME?

13:11.558 --> 13:12.993
SUCKY.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.395
LOOK, KIDS DO STUPID THINGS.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.998
PROBABLY ONE OF MIKE'S FRIENDS
PUT HIM UP TO IT.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.768
HE'S BROKEN
INTO OTHER HOUSES, TOO.

13:21.768 --> 13:25.472
JASON CAUGHT HIM
BREAKING INTO HIS HOUSE
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.409
JASON? AS IN ALI'S-BROTHER-
WHO-SAT-NEXT-TO-ME-

13:29.409 --> 13:32.345
AT-THE-DINNER-THAT-
NEVER-HAPPENED-JASON?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.682
IS THAT WHAT YOU TWO
WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT?

13:35.682 --> 13:38.185
YEAH.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.925
IS THIS YOURS, TOO?
IT'S AMAZING.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.027
JENNA MADE THAT.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.162
WOW. SHE'S TALENTED.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.637
SO HOW'RE THINGS SHAPING UP
BETWEEN YOU GUYS?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.439
SHE DROPPED THE CLASS.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.909
YEAH, BUT BEFORE SHE LEFT,
DID YOU GUYS FIND A WAY...

14:01.909 --> 14:04.611
NO. SHE LEFT
BEFORE I HAD THE CHANCE.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.817
ARIA, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING ON?
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.988
I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.591
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

14:18.591 --> 14:22.695
I GET IT. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE EMBARRASSED WITH ME.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.631
ABOUT ANYTHING.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.500
MAYBE YOU COULD STOP BY
MY PLACE LATER...

14:27.500 --> 14:29.269
SURE.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.439
I WILL CALL YOU.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.509
BYE.

14:39.746 --> 14:44.884
SO SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT
YOU AND THIS JASON GUY?

14:44.884 --> 14:49.356
WHAT? NO. NO.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.514
DAD?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.584
HOW? WHAT?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.553
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU
AFTER THE MEET.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.189
IS MOM WITH YOU?

15:22.189 --> 15:23.656
NO, SHE'S STILL IN TEXAS.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.758
I HAD TO BE IN DELAWARE
FOR A TRAINING SEMINAR

15:25.758 --> 15:28.728
AND THEY CANCELLED
ALL THE FLIGHTS BACK.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.363
SOME HUGE STORM DOWN THERE.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.133
SO I FIGURED I COULD EITHER
SIT IN THE AIRPORT IN BETHESDA

15:33.133 --> 15:36.403
OR IN THE STANDS IN ROSEWOOD.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.806
YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE?
WELL, YOUR MOM SAID
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT MEET.

15:39.806 --> 15:43.810
SHE SAID THAT YOU TOLD HER
THAT THE SCOUT FROM
DANBY COLLEGE IS COMING.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.078
I DID?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.114
OH, RIGHT, I DID, YEAH.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.949
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM.
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN? RABIN?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.920
DAD, I WISH I'D KNOWN.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.355
DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

15:55.355 --> 15:58.258
I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR
WHOLE PRE-RACE ROUTINE,

15:58.258 --> 16:01.194
SO I'M NOT GONNA
HOLD YOU UP. GO.

16:01.194 --> 16:06.566
BUT IF YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
SCREAMING IN THE STANDS
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON, THAT'S ME.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.735
GO GET 'EM.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.574
( sighs )

16:18.678 --> 16:21.448
( groaning )

16:23.650 --> 16:27.120
( screaming )

16:28.821 --> 16:31.624
EMILY?

16:31.624 --> 16:33.893
EMILY!

16:33.893 --> 16:35.695
OW! OW!

16:35.695 --> 16:40.633
L31 REQUESTING
A RESCUE AMBULANCE UNIT
AT ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL!

16:40.633 --> 16:41.868
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

16:41.868 --> 16:46.139
OH, GOD! OH!

16:49.842 --> 16:52.579
HOW CAN I HAVE AN ULCER?
I THOUGHT I JUST
PULLED A MUSCLE.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.581
THEY'RE CAUSED BY STRESS, HON.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.916
ALL RIGHT, AND LET'S FACE IT--

16:56.916 --> 17:00.420
YOU LEAVING HOME,
YOUR MA MOVING,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.489
WELL, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR FAIR SHARE.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.723
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?
WHEN CAN I SWIM AGAIN?

17:04.723 --> 17:08.161
THAT'S OFF THE TABLE
AT THE MOMENT.

17:08.161 --> 17:12.031
EM, EMMY, LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.868
IF YOU'RE STRESSING
ABOUT THE DANBY SCHOLARSHIP,
I WANT YOU TO LET IT GO, OKAY?

17:16.868 --> 17:19.972
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO WITHDRAW THE OFFER
BECAUSE YOU HAD A SETBACK.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.241
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.211
I KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO REST.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.944
YOU NEED TO LISTEN
TO THE DOCTOR.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.347
I NEED TO SWIM.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.949
HEY, YOU WILL, BABE.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.684
YOU WILL...
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.955
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO THIS SCOUT?

17:35.955 --> 17:37.357
DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBER--

17:37.357 --> 17:40.059
NO, DON'T CALL HIM.
I'LL DO IT.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.095
I DON'T MIND.
OR GET YOUR MA TO DO IT.

17:42.095 --> 17:46.733
NO, I DON'T WANNA SAY ANYTHING
TILL I KNOW WHEN I CAN
SWIM AGAIN, OKAY?

17:46.733 --> 17:50.270
OKAY. OKAY.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.904
( sighs )

17:51.904 --> 17:54.474
AREN'T ULCERS
SOMETHING OLD PEOPLE GET?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.609
GET THAT LOOK OFF YOUR FACE.
YOU'RE GONNA FREAK HER OUT.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.212
HER? WHAT ABOUT ME?
I'M HAVING DEJA VU.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.013
I SPENT A WEEK IN THIS PLACE.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.717
IF I SEE ANOTHER BOWL
OF GREEN JELLO, I'M GONNA
PUKE ON YOUR SHOES.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.220
OH, GOD.
I'M GONNA WALK BEHIND YOU.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.621
( phone rings )

18:08.621 --> 18:10.623
IS THAT ARIA?

18:10.623 --> 18:13.226
CALEB.
I'LL JUST CALL HIM BACK LATER.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.427
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.862
( elevator dings )

18:23.170 --> 18:26.239
HAN, ARE YOU AND CALEB...

18:26.239 --> 18:29.108
WE'RE FINE.
THERE'S JUST STUFF GOING ON.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.677
LIKE WHAT?

18:30.677 --> 18:32.212
LIKE AN UNDERCOVER COP

18:32.212 --> 18:33.913
IN A CAR FOLLOWING HIM.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.150
WHY?
( sighs)
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.952
YOU HAVE TO.
YOU'RE IN AN ELEVATOR.
WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.354
DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THE COP?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.523
NO. I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.791
WHY NOT?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.659
BECAUSE I'M STILL
THINKING THINGS THROUGH.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.428
WHAT IS THERE
TO THINK THROUGH?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.563
IF I TELL HIM,
HE MIGHT RUN, OKAY?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.534
I'M NOT READY
TO LOSE HIM AGAIN.

18:54.534 --> 18:58.238
YEAH, AND IF THE COPS
ARE REALLY AFTER HIM,

18:58.238 --> 19:00.240
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE HIM ANYWAY.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.225
HEY. DID YOU JUST GET HOME?

19:18.225 --> 19:20.993
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA COME BY THE HOTEL
SO WE COULD GRAB SOME DINNER.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.897
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE.
HANNA CAME BY THE BANK
TO BORROW MY CAR.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.233
EMILY IS IN THE HOSPITAL.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.335
WHAT? WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

19:28.335 --> 19:30.470
SHE COLLAPSED AT SCHOOL.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.639
I JUST GOT AN UPDATE--
IT'S AN ULCER.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.141
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
HER DAD'S THERE.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.609
WOW. POOR KID.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.546
DO YOU WANT ME
TO RUN YOU DOWN THERE?

19:39.546 --> 19:44.517
OR WE COULD STAY IN,
GET SOME FOOD.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.353
TOM...

19:47.354 --> 19:51.224
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.327
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE ANOTHER MEAL
LIKE BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.

19:54.327 --> 20:00.367
THIS...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

20:02.034 --> 20:06.439
BUT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET YOU STAY LAST NIGHT.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.476
IT'S CONFUSING TO HANNA,
TO YOU, TO ME.

20:09.476 --> 20:13.713
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ANYBODY.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.750
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED,
AS THE MAILMAN

20:17.750 --> 20:20.287
SO PROMPTLY REMINDED US
THIS MORNING.

20:20.287 --> 20:25.292
ASHLEY--
TOM, I NEED TO BE WITH A MAN
WHO'S SURE OF WHAT HE WANTS.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.561
THAT WAS NEVER YOU.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.560
SO ALL THOSE MUSCLE SPASMS
AND THE PAIN--

21:00.560 --> 21:02.128
THAT'S ALL
COMING FROM YOUR STOMACH?

21:02.128 --> 21:05.665
YEAH, BUT ULCERS CAN HEAL.
IT'S NOT FOREVER, EM.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.700
YEAH, BUT SHE'S GOT A HOLE--

21:07.700 --> 21:12.339
YES, THERE'S A HOLE
IN HER STOMACH. MOVING ON.
WHERE'D YOUR DAD GO?

21:12.339 --> 21:16.876
HE WENT TO THE HOUSE
TO TALK TO THE NEW TENANTS.

21:16.876 --> 21:20.012
GUYS, I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.
I CAN'T KEEP LYING TO HIM.

21:20.012 --> 21:24.283
I GUESS NOT, NOT IF IT'S
EATING HOLES IN YOUR STOMACH.
MOVING ON!

21:24.283 --> 21:27.053
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I GOT HERE AS SOON AS I COULD.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.055
I HAD TO ESCAPE
FAMILY COURT IN MY LIVING ROOM.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.057
MIKE ON TRIAL?

21:31.057 --> 21:33.826
YEAH, BUT THE DEFENDANT
DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.894
I GOT YOUR FAV.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.632
OH, SHE CAN'T DRINK COFFEE.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.369
YEAH, SHE'S GOT
A HOLE IN HER STOMACH.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.571
I'LL TRADE IT IN
FOR AN HERBAL TEA,

21:44.571 --> 21:47.407
UNLESS YOU WANT US ALL HERE
WHEN YOUR DAD GETS BACK.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.442
SHE'S NOT TELLING HER DAD.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.744
IF HE FINDS OUT
THAT THE LETTER IS FAKE,
HE'S GONNA MOVE HER TO TEXAS.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.713
IF SHE DOESN'T TELL HIM,
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER.

21:53.713 --> 21:57.417
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE UP
HER MIND RIGHT THIS SECOND,
OKAY?

21:57.417 --> 22:00.520
SHE ALREADY HAS.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.889
I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.184
IT'S THE THIRD FLOOR.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.521
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR FRIEND
EMILY, RIGHT?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.923
YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHE WAS HERE?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.758
I SAW HER NAME
ON THE ADMITTANCE CHART.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.861
THEY RUSHED HER INTO THE E.R.,
BUT SHE'S STABILIZED.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.139
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GOING FOR A RIDE.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.841
( chuckles )

22:54.841 --> 22:57.844
SO HOW IS SHE?
HAVE YOU SEEN EMILY?

22:57.844 --> 22:59.579
I HAVEN'T,
BUT SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.681
I'LL BE POPPING IN
SOON ENOUGH ON ROUNDS.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.059
SPENCER,
YOU WANT THE THIRD FLOOR.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.764
WHAT IS DOWN THERE?

23:17.764 --> 23:21.934
KITCHEN, LAUNDRY, RADIOLOGY,
PATHOLOGY, THE MORGUE.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.504
EMILY HAS
A MUCH BETTER VIEW.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.249
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY KNOW?

23:37.249 --> 23:41.854
LAST NIGHT, SPENCER WAS
HAMMERING ME WITH QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE MURDER WEAPON.

23:41.854 --> 23:46.292
WHETHER THE CORONER
COULD TELL IF IT WAS USED
BY A MAN OR A WOMAN.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.094
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
NOTHING.

23:48.094 --> 23:52.231
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SAY ANYTHING.
SHE CUT ME OFF AND RAN HOME.

23:52.231 --> 23:55.502
BUT THEN WHEN I SAW HER AGAIN
THIS MORNING, SUDDENLY IT WAS
OFF HER RADAR.

23:55.502 --> 23:58.237
SHE'S PLAYING YOU.
I DON'T THINK SO.

23:58.237 --> 24:01.407
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT JASON?
I'M NOT SURE.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.611
BUT THEY'RE
DEFINITELY QUESTIONING
WHETHER IAN KILLED HER.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.447
WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.523
( knock at door )

24:16.523 --> 24:18.390
EMILY?

24:18.390 --> 24:19.792
OH, HI.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.794
I THOUGHT SPENCER
WAS UP HERE.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.497
SHE JUST WENT DOWN
TO THE CAFETERIA
TO GET SOME SOUP.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.699
WHAT, OUR FOOD? WILLINGLY?

24:27.900 --> 24:30.369
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

24:30.369 --> 24:33.573
HUNGRY. WEAK. SCARED.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.977
ARE YOU MY DOCTOR NOW?
NO. JUST CHECKING IN.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.612
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS,
THE MEDS ARE WORKING

24:39.612 --> 24:41.514
AND YOUR STOMACH'S
ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY.

24:41.514 --> 24:45.184
ALTHOUGH I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
CELEBRATE THIS WEEKEND
WITH A TAKE-OUT CURRY.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.554
IS THERE BAD NEWS?

24:49.255 --> 24:51.958
THERE IS BAD NEWS.

24:51.958 --> 24:55.227
LOOK, EMILY, I KNOW
YOU SWIM COMPETITIVELY.

24:55.227 --> 24:58.565
AND I KNOW THE PRESSURE
EVERY ATHLETE'S UNDER
TO PERFORM AT THEIR BEST,

24:58.565 --> 25:00.266
TO CONSTANTLY BREAK
THEIR OWN RECORDS.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.935
WAIT, I THOUGHT SWIMMING
DIDN'T CAUSE THE ULCER.

25:02.935 --> 25:07.406
IT DIDN'T, BUT YOUR PANELS
CAME BACK WITH HIGH LEVELS
OF HGH IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.909
HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE?
I'VE NEVER TAKEN THAT.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.111
EMILY, IF YOU'RE USING
A PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG
OR ANY KIND OF STEROID,

25:12.111 --> 25:14.413
IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP
IN YOUR TESTS.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.949
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PERILS
OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING!

25:16.949 --> 25:19.251
THIS IS INSANE!
YOUR TEST IS WRONG!

25:19.251 --> 25:21.921
EMILY, THESE TESTS DON'T LIE.
AND I DID CHECK TWICE.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.090
I'M HERE AS A FRIEND.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.759
I ASKED YOUR ATTENDING
IF I COULD SPEAK TO YOU FIRST.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.995
HAVE YOU TOLD MY DAD
ABOUT THIS?

25:28.995 --> 25:31.497
I HAVEN'T. BUT YOU'RE A MINOR
SO HE WILL HAVE TO KNOW.

25:31.497 --> 25:34.200
NO, YOU CAN'T. PLEASE.
DON'T TELL HIM THIS.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.804
I COULD GET KICKED OFF
THE TEAM, IT'D RUIN
ANY CHANCE OF A SCHOLARSHIP.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.606
SLOW DOWN.
PLEASE.

25:39.606 --> 25:43.610
I'LL TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.
JUST DON'T TELL MY PARENTS.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.582
I'LL SPEAK TO YOUR ATTENDING.
SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

25:49.582 --> 25:50.883
( sighs )

25:56.088 --> 25:57.156
( sighs )

26:18.210 --> 26:20.279
CALEB, GET IN!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:20.279 --> 26:21.714
JUST HURRY UP! GET IN!

26:23.182 --> 26:24.851
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO CATCH A MOVIE.
CLOSE THE DOOR!

26:24.851 --> 26:26.986
OR WE CAN JUST BE IN ONE.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.321
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?

26:46.673 --> 26:49.241
PSST. HEY, IN HERE.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.677
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL?

26:50.677 --> 26:52.611
SHH. TALK LATER.
YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.614
WHY ARE YOU WEARING--
COME ON!

27:09.461 --> 27:10.863
( knock at door )

27:18.237 --> 27:21.640
I HOPE THAT'S HOMEWORK
YOU'RE DOING.
IT IS.

27:21.640 --> 27:27.546
SO YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL TODAY

27:27.546 --> 27:29.548
WITH YOUR FRIEND CHAZ?

27:29.548 --> 27:31.350
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.752
REALLY? SINCE WHEN?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.787
SINCE I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.957
OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT
WHY YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP
THIS AFTERNOON.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.526
IGNORING THIS
WILL NOT MAKE IT GO AWAY.

27:40.526 --> 27:42.261
AND THE PIRELLIS MAY NOT BE
PRESSING CHARGES,

27:42.261 --> 27:44.030
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK WITH US.

27:44.030 --> 27:47.466
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU WOULD
BREAK IN TO THEIR HOUSE.

27:47.466 --> 27:51.470
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

27:51.470 --> 27:53.205
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ANYTHING.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.407
WELL, THEN YOU WENT THROUGH
AN AWFUL LOT OF TROUBLE

27:55.407 --> 27:58.377
TO GET YOURSELF IN TROUBLE.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.113
MIKE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

28:01.113 --> 28:04.150
I SAID
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT!
AND I SAID WE HAVE TO!

28:04.150 --> 28:07.053
SO ONCE AGAIN
WE'RE BACK ON YOUR SCHEDULE?

28:09.521 --> 28:12.291
SHOULD I HURRY UP AND TALK FAST
BEFORE YOU MOVE OUT AGAIN?

28:30.977 --> 28:32.979
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

28:32.979 --> 28:36.182
IT BELONGS TO SPENCER'S FAMILY.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.683
I'M GUESSING SO DOES
MOST OF PENNSYLVANIA.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.786
DO THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.420
NOPE.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.122
SO WE'RE BREAKING IN.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.657
WE'RE BORROWING IT.
IS THIS KINDLING?

28:45.657 --> 28:50.129
MM, NOT UNLESS WE
WANNA BURN THE COUCH.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.067
CAN I HELP?

29:03.342 --> 29:06.145
SO ARE YOU GONNA LOSE THE SCARF
AND SHADES AT SOME POINT,

29:06.145 --> 29:07.847
OR DID YOU BRING
A COSTUME FOR ME, TOO?

29:07.847 --> 29:09.816
CALEB, THERE'S SOMEONE
FOLLOWING YOU.

29:09.816 --> 29:13.352
WHAT?

29:13.352 --> 29:16.088
I THINK IT'S A COP.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.990
HE DRIVES A DARK GREY CAMARO.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.193
AND I'VE SEEN HIM
AROUND TOWN A LOT LATELY.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.130
HE'S DEFINITELY
WATCHING YOU.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.265
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED HIM?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.600
NO.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.537
BUT THEN AGAIN, I GUESS
I KINDA STOPPED LOOKING.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.073
HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWED BEFORE?

29:37.776 --> 29:41.580
DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THE STUFF YOU DID
IN ALLENTOWN?

29:41.580 --> 29:42.915
MAYBE.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.054
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU
WAY MORE THAN YOU NEED TO KNOW.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.788
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

29:49.788 --> 29:52.524
I MEAN, IF HE
WANTS TO ARREST YOU,
WHAT'S HE WAITING FOR?

29:52.524 --> 29:55.361
WHAT DOES HE THINK YOU DID?
I DON'T KNOW.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.996
BUT IF HE HAS
A QUESTION TO ASK ME,

29:56.996 --> 29:59.098
HE NEEDS TO COME UP
AND ASK ME.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.367
I'M NOT HIDING.
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE.

30:01.367 --> 30:04.236
YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T EXACTLY
IN THE YELLOW PAGES.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.305
THIS IS WHY
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.941
I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE SAFER HERE.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.077
I DON'T WANNA HIDE.

30:11.077 --> 30:14.881
HANNA, I'LL DEAL WITH THIS.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.017
BY LEAVING TOWN AGAIN?

30:18.017 --> 30:21.620
THIS TIME? NO, I WON'T.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.423
YOU SAY THAT NOW,
BUT YOU WILL.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.828
HANNA...

30:36.969 --> 30:39.205
I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.042
BUT IF YOU DO,
CAN I COME WITH YOU?

30:43.042 --> 30:44.410
I'LL PACK REALLY FAST.

30:44.410 --> 30:47.846
SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW
THAT I'M GOOD AT CAMPING.

31:20.746 --> 31:24.350
OH, UH, CAN YOU LEAVE THAT?
I HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.417
SURE.

31:28.854 --> 31:30.222
THANK YOU.

32:03.022 --> 32:07.626
YOUR PAIN CREAM? "A" IS IN
OUR MEDICINE CABINET, TOO?
THIS HAS TO BE A NEW RECORD.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.695
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN IN YOUR SYSTEM?

32:09.695 --> 32:11.097
DID IT DAMAGE ANY ORGANS?

32:11.097 --> 32:13.132
FORGET MY ORGANS!
IT'S ON MY MEDICAL CHART!

32:13.132 --> 32:15.401
IT'S RUINED MY LIFE!
I CAN NEVER SWIM AGAIN!

32:15.401 --> 32:17.636
EMILY, MEDICAL RECORDS
ARE PRIVATE.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.405
NOT FROM YOUR PARENTS!

32:19.405 --> 32:21.373
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA
TELL YOUR DAD?

32:21.373 --> 32:23.042
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.078
TAKE ME TO TEXAS. I'M DONE.
IT CAN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS.

32:26.078 --> 32:29.081
EMILY, REMEMBER,
"A" TRIED TO PLOW DOWN
HANNA WITH A CAR.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.017
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

32:31.017 --> 32:34.386
I'M JUST SAYING THAT "A"
TRIED TO TAKE ONE OF US DOWN
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

32:34.386 --> 32:37.223
SPENCER, "A" IS TAKING US DOWN.
ONE AT A TIME.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.058
ARIA'S PROBABLY NEXT.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.859
CAN WE ALL GO TO TEXAS?

32:40.859 --> 32:44.096
NO! STOP IT!
WE'RE NOT GIVING IN
TO THIS FREAK!

32:44.096 --> 32:46.965
LOOK, WE ARE THIS CLOSE
TO FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALISON.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.235
AND IF "A" IS THE ONE
THAT KILLED HER--
AND IAN.

32:49.235 --> 32:52.138
YEAH, AND THEN "A" IS GONNA BE
THE ONE TO LEAVE ROSEWOOD,
NOT US.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.572
( knock at door )

32:57.043 --> 32:58.577
HI. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
NO WORRIES.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.447
UH, WE ACTUALLY JUST
HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.116
WHEN DID YOU TWO START
VOLUNTEERING FOR THE HOSPITAL?

33:04.116 --> 33:09.021
TODAY'S ACTUALLY OUR FIRST DAY.
WE'RE STILL ON HOUR ONE.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.389
WE'LL TAKE THIS FOR YOU.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.523
SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.731
HOW'S EVERYTHING AT THE HOUSE?
GOOD.

33:19.731 --> 33:24.736
I FOUND THE MANUAL
TO THE ALARM SYSTEM,
CHANGED THE PASSWORD.

33:24.736 --> 33:28.240
BUT I TOLD THEM,
"YOU'RE IN ROSEWOOD,
YOU CAN RELAX."

33:28.240 --> 33:31.743
IT'S MOSTLY FOR SHOW ANYWAY.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.682
YOU FEEL ANY BETTER?

33:36.682 --> 33:39.085
YEAH, A LITTLE.

33:41.987 --> 33:45.491
DAD, UM, I'VE BEEN THINKING--

33:45.491 --> 33:49.561
SO HAVE I.
AND I CALLED MA.

33:49.561 --> 33:55.767
THIS WHOLE SCHOLARSHIP THING--
IT'S NOT WORTH IT, EMMY.

33:55.767 --> 34:00.572
WE DON'T WANT YOU
DRIVING YOURSELF
TO MORE ULCERS OR WORSE.

34:00.572 --> 34:06.812
THE HELL WITH DANBY.
YOU SWIM BECAUSE YOU LOVE TO.

34:06.812 --> 34:10.282
OR DON'T.
DAD--

34:10.282 --> 34:13.952
BABY, WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO PAY FOR COLLEGE.

34:13.952 --> 34:17.956
AND I KNOW THAT THERE
ARE DOZENS OF SCHOOLS OUT THERE

34:17.956 --> 34:22.128
THAT WOULD BE
THRILLED TO HAVE YOU,
IN OR OUT OF THE POOL.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.199
WE JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY, BABY.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.110
( crying )

34:44.382 --> 34:45.650
THAT'S IT.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.530
OH, IT'S FREEZING IN HERE.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.299
YEAH, BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.

35:04.069 --> 35:06.172
ARIA, HEY, FOCUS.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.006
I CAN'T DO THIS.

35:08.006 --> 35:12.110
NO, YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING,
OKAY? I AM. JUST WATCH THE DOOR.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.747
WHAT IS THAT? COOKIES?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.816
HOW CAN ANYBODY
EAT COOKIES IN HERE?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.485
THEY STAY FRESH.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.353
OKAY, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME KIND OF SYSTEM.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.721
HERE, THIS IS IT.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.293
THEY'VE GOT AUTOPSIES IN HERE
DATING BACK TO 2007.

35:28.660 --> 35:34.866
OKAY, D... DEHAVEN,
DELMORE, DILAURENTIS. ALISON.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.737
( sighs )

35:51.082 --> 35:53.319
HI, HONEY. HOW'S EMILY?

35:53.319 --> 35:57.055
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S COMING HOME TOMORROW,
I THINK.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.224
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:58.224 --> 36:00.392
CLEANING.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.594
YOU'RE TOSSING EVERYTHING
YOU BOUGHT FOR DAD.
WHERE IS HE?

36:02.594 --> 36:06.798
HE WENT BACK HOME.
HE'S GONNA CALL YOU.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.534
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

36:08.534 --> 36:11.303
IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GO.

36:11.303 --> 36:14.740
DID YOU GUYS HAVE A FIGHT?
NO.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.975
WELL, THEN WHY
WOULD HE GO BACK TO ISABEL?

36:16.975 --> 36:19.378
BECAUSE HE LOVES HER
AND HE'S GOING TO MARRY HER.

36:19.378 --> 36:23.782
NO, HE DOESN'T.
HE'S BEEN FIGHTING WITH HER.
HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.150
HANNA--
NO.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.152
I SAW THE TWO OF YOU ACT
LIKE YOU WERE ON A HONEYMOON,

36:27.152 --> 36:30.622
SIPPING WINE ON THE PATIO,
SLOW DANCING, LAUGHING.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.225
I HEARD YOU.
HE SLEPT OVER LAST NIGHT!

36:33.225 --> 36:35.594
YES, HE DID.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.429
AND I REALIZED
THIS MORNING

36:37.429 --> 36:40.932
THAT MY WEEK
OF MAGICAL THINKING IS OVER.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.734
WHY? WHAT DID HE DO WRONG?

36:42.734 --> 36:45.271
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID,
"THINGS CHANGE, PEOPLE GROW."

36:45.271 --> 36:46.705
THEY DO.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.508
I HAVE.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.577
I'M NOT SURE THAT
YOUR FATHER HAS.

36:51.577 --> 36:58.250
I STARTED TO KNOW
WHAT ISABEL MUST'VE FELT LIKE
WHEN HE WAS STILL MARRIED TO ME.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.151
WHO CARES ABOUT ISABEL?

37:00.151 --> 37:02.688
HONEY, I'M NOT GOING
TO LIE TO YOU.

37:02.688 --> 37:06.525
YOUR FATHER AND I WERE BOTH...
INDULGING IN A FANTASY.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.695
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

37:10.996 --> 37:14.199
HE'S MADE A COMMITMENT
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

37:14.199 --> 37:16.768
WELL, HE CAN UN-COMMIT!

37:16.768 --> 37:18.404
DO YOU WANNA BE WITH HIM
OR NOT?

37:18.404 --> 37:19.838
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED!

37:21.373 --> 37:23.475
NO, I DON'T.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.313
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT YOU WANNA HEAR.

37:36.087 --> 37:40.559
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS?
"OCCIPITAL FONTANELLE"?

37:40.559 --> 37:42.828
IT'S THIS PART OF YOUR SKULL.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.664
LOOK WHO I'M TALKING TO.
WERE YOU PRE-MED IN PRE-SCHOOL?

37:45.664 --> 37:47.766
THERE'S A LOT IN HERE
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.102
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
HERE IS THE SUMMARY PAGE.

37:51.102 --> 37:55.307
"THE IMPACT ON THE POSTERIOR
OF THE VICTIM'S CRANIUM..."

37:55.307 --> 37:58.710
BACK OF HER HEAD.
"INDICATES SHE WAS FACING AWAY
FROM THE ASSAILANT."

37:58.710 --> 38:02.113
THEY GOT HER FROM BEHIND.
SHE WAS AMBUSHED.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.515
OR RUNNING AWAY.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.351
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.356
"THE CRANIUM WAS DISPLACED
INWARD UPON IMPACT..."

38:10.356 --> 38:11.890
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:11.890 --> 38:15.727
IT MEANS SHE WAS HIT SO HARD,
THEY DENTED HER SKULL.

38:17.162 --> 38:23.234
"AND THE WEAPON WAS MOST LIKELY
A CURVED, BLUNT EDGE."

38:23.234 --> 38:24.670
LIKE A FIELD HOCKEY STICK.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.805
YEAH, LIKE THE ONE THAT
ALI BORROWED FROM ME?

38:26.805 --> 38:28.540
THE ONE THAT JASON MOST LIKELY
BURIED IN MY BACKYARD.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.743
JUST KEEP READING.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.512
( gasps )

38:33.512 --> 38:36.615
WHAT? WHAT DOES IT SAY?

38:36.615 --> 38:40.251
THERE WAS DIRT IN HER LUNGS.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.320
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.256
IT MEANS THAT SHE WAS BREATHING
IN DIRT WHEN SHE DIED.

38:45.256 --> 38:49.428
THAT THE BLOW TO HER HEAD
ISN'T WHAT KILLED HER.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.096
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ARIA...

38:51.096 --> 38:54.332
ALISON WAS BURIED ALIVE.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.951
HEY! STOP!

39:14.520 --> 39:16.388
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

39:16.388 --> 39:17.756
YEAH, THERE'S A PROBLEM.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.491
YOU STALKING CALEB
IS A PROBLEM.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.192
HE KNOWS WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.528
REALLY?

39:22.528 --> 39:23.862
YEAH, AND HE'S
NOT GOING BACK.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.731
HE'S FINALLY GOT
HIS LIFE TOGETHER

39:25.731 --> 39:27.466
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA PULL IT APART.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.401
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT YOU WANT,

39:29.401 --> 39:32.203
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN WHO LOVE HIM
AND WILL PROTECT HIM.

39:32.203 --> 39:36.107
SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA GET WHAT YOU WANT
BY SPYING ON HIM.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.709
SO GET LOST.

39:48.454 --> 39:49.721
YOU TOOK THIS?

39:49.721 --> 39:51.189
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK.

39:51.189 --> 39:54.159
JUST LOOK AT THE SUMMARY PAGE.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.527
( phone vibrates )

39:55.527 --> 39:57.062
THAT MUST BE HANNA.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.465
NO, IT'S EZRA.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL HIM.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.966
OH, GO AHEAD.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.333
HE'S DOWNSTAIRS.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.735
I'LL BE BACK.
YEAH.

40:06.872 --> 40:11.543
"DISPLACED CRANIUM"?
"CURVED BLUNT WEAPON"?
THAT'S A HOCKEY STICK, EM.

40:11.543 --> 40:15.914
ARIA DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR THIS,
BUT JASON IS LOOKING WORSE
AND WORSE.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.024
( sighs )

40:29.495 --> 40:31.563
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

40:31.563 --> 40:35.366
NO. NO, WE'RE JUST HERE
KEEPING HER COMPANY.

40:35.366 --> 40:38.236
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
STRAIGHT HOME FROM HERE?

40:38.236 --> 40:42.641
I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE UP FOR COMPANY,
YOU COULD STOP BY MY PLACE.

40:42.641 --> 40:48.179
( phone rings )

40:50.281 --> 40:51.717
YOU NEED TO GET THAT?

40:51.717 --> 40:55.554
WHAT? NO.
NO, IT'S JUST MY DAD.

40:55.554 --> 41:02.027
AH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET HOME AFTER THIS.
THEY'RE PRETTY WORRIED.

41:02.027 --> 41:04.329
OH. OKAY.

41:04.329 --> 41:05.797
ANOTHER NIGHT?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.933
OFF COURSE.
JUST TELL ME WHEN.

41:30.589 --> 41:35.093
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE KNOWS I'M TAILING HIM.

41:35.093 --> 41:39.230
I'M SORRY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

41:55.981 --> 41:59.150
MAYBE YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
CALL YOUR DAD.

41:59.150 --> 42:03.589
WHY?
WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE THAT.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.307
WHERE'S PAGE FIVE?

42:23.609 --> 42:25.611
DID YOU DROP
ONE OF THE PAGES?

42:25.611 --> 42:28.546
NO. WE TOOK
THE WHOLE FILE.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.616
MAYBE IT DROPPED
IN THE ELEVATOR.

42:30.616 --> 42:33.318
NO, NOTHING DROPPED
IN THE ELEVATOR.

42:33.318 --> 42:38.389
LOOK, HERE'S PAGE 1, 2, 3, 4...
PAGE 6.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.792
WHERE THE HELL IS PAGE 5?
