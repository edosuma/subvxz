41:12.190 --> 41:13.891
to the League of Autonomous Worlds.

41:18.630 --> 41:19.918
What about Ishida?

41:19.927 --> 41:21.760
Less than an hour
after the announcement,

41:21.763 --> 41:24.368
he launched a massive
attack against Pyr,

41:24.403 --> 41:27.138
pretty much ending all
hope for a ceasefire.

41:29.641 --> 41:32.776
Well. Like I said.

41:32.811 --> 41:35.479
Much worse places to be.

41:37.513 --> 41:39.683
Here, here.

41:39.718 --> 41:42.153
Fries?

41:49.729 --> 41:52.128
<i>Android, Five, how's
it going down there?</i>

41:52.159 --> 41:54.242
We've made several
changes to the Blink Drive

41:54.244 --> 41:55.676
that I believe will overcome the damage

41:55.678 --> 41:57.412
done by the Ishida scientists.

41:57.447 --> 41:59.114
How will we know for sure?

41:59.149 --> 42:01.216
<i>First we'll run a full diagnostic,</i>

42:01.251 --> 42:03.251
followed by a series of simulations.

42:03.286 --> 42:05.987
If the instability persists,
we should be able to detect it,

42:06.022 --> 42:08.022
long before we attempt a first live test.

42:08.057 --> 42:10.125
<i>All right, let us
know what happens.</i>

42:10.160 --> 42:12.327
That's it, we're ready.

42:14.798 --> 42:17.266
I have a good feeling about this.

42:20.677 --> 42:23.271
[machinery humming]

42:23.306 --> 42:24.973
So far, so good.

42:25.008 --> 42:26.374
[electricity crackling]

42:26.409 --> 42:28.576
Wait.

42:28.611 --> 42:31.747
[electronic pulsing]

42:36.186 --> 42:39.154
<i>[dark music]</i>
