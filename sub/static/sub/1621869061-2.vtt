[indistinct radio chatter]

00:25.358 --> 00:27.360
[narrator] You can't know Gus's story

00:28.028 --> 00:29.946
without knowing Aimee's too.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.618
The end of the world's got
a funny way of making connections.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.872
Aimee never saw it coming,

00:38.955 --> 00:41.541
because before the Great Crumble…

00:43.418 --> 00:44.961
[man 1] It's like we never talk anymore.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.130
[narrator] …she had a hard time
connecting to anything.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.174
[woman 1] Whose decision was it
to have three kids?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.217
You're not blaming our kids on me.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.054
-[man 2] He never listens to me.
-That is completely unfair.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.931
-All I do is listen to you.
-Then what did I just say?

00:57.015 --> 00:58.600
[woman 2] He has a great job, but…

00:58.683 --> 01:01.936
[narrator]
You see, Aimee lived inside a cage.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.439
-[woman 2] He chews…
-The cage of a mundane life.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.398
Disgusting.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.279
[sinister music playing]

01:11.362 --> 01:13.782

[alarm ringing]

01:16.493 --> 01:18.912
[announcer]
This is the Emergency Broadcast System.

This is not a test.

[people clamoring]

01:21.539 --> 01:25.251
[official on TV] It doesn't show mercy,
and it is here, and it is now.

01:26.294 --> 01:29.422
And if you don't pray,
now might be a good time to start.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.758
The H5G9 strain…

01:32.467 --> 01:34.719
[announcer]
This is officially your final warning.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.679
-This is a mandatory quarantine.
-[helicopter whirring]

01:36.763 --> 01:39.432

01:43.520 --> 01:46.356
[reporter] Officials are telling
everyone to stay indoors.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.857
Lock your homes.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.111
Do not come in contact
with anyone showing symptoms.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.656
If you're healthy,
you need to quarantine in place.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.118
[narrator] Hours became days.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.246
Days became weeks.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.874

-[distant wailing]
-[suspenseful music playing]

02:16.886 --> 02:20.682
[narrator] But just when she thought
the world had locked her away for good…

02:24.102 --> 02:26.354
nature had another idea.

And for the first time in Aimee's life…

03:18.907 --> 03:20.158
she felt awake.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.623
Just like that,

03:27.248 --> 03:31.502
Aimee knew exactly where she needed to go.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.321
Everybody left, huh?

03:58.404 --> 03:59.405
[gate creaking]

04:04.911 --> 04:06.621
Are you ready to be free?

04:07.872 --> 04:08.790
Yeah?

04:13.419 --> 04:14.254
Hm?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.257
[narrator]
Some stories start at the beginning.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.971
Well, go on, then.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.306
[triumphant music playing]

04:25.390 --> 04:28.268

04:31.854 --> 04:34.148
[bird cawing]

04:42.115 --> 04:45.952
And somewhere,
far, far out of the deep woods,

04:46.703 --> 04:49.747
fate was bringing
all our stories together.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.756
[Gus] Big Man!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.967
Wait for me!

05:09.976 --> 05:12.937
-[leaves rustling]
-[footsteps approaching]

05:15.523 --> 05:17.066
How long are you gonna follow me?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.193
Till we get there, I guess.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.278
Get where?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.447
Colorado. That's where she is.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.364
Who?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.283
-My mom.
-Aw…

05:26.576 --> 05:27.994
I forgot to tell you.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.163
Colorado blew up.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.123
Yeah, it's…

05:33.041 --> 05:34.250
Everything's gone.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.794
Lasers, I think, and, um…

05:37.545 --> 05:40.089
all the people there
are gone too. So sad.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.468
Sorry you missed it.
Oh, well. Have a great life.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.428
[light piano music playing]

05:46.387 --> 05:47.221
That was a joke.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.562
Your jokes aren't very funny, Big Man.

05:54.645 --> 05:59.025
As funny as a little deer kid thinking
he could make it out here on his own.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.402
-[sighs]
-I'm not alone, I got you.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.282
-What'd I tell you?
-If I went and looked for her alone--

06:06.366 --> 06:07.617
I said stay put,

06:07.700 --> 06:10.411
as in don't leave,
as in stay your ass in the woods

06:10.495 --> 06:13.122
and munch on shrubs
or whatever it is you do.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.674
What are you doing?

06:23.758 --> 06:26.219
My Pubba said
we gotta leave places like we found them,

06:26.302 --> 06:28.596
hide our trash
so bad people don't find us.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.936
Hm. [grunts]

06:36.813 --> 06:39.148
[light piano music continues]

06:39.232 --> 06:40.149

Let me guess.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.124
You're nocturnal too.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.544
[Gus] I'll be quiet, I promise.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.130
Ain't gonna happen, little man.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.174
You're creepy as hell back there.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.759
Get out here where I can see you.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.514
[sighs]

07:53.598 --> 07:54.849
[Gus] Where do you live?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.143
-[Big Man] Nowhere.
-Where's that?

07:57.226 --> 07:59.395
-Anywhere I want.
-Do you have friends?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.771
-Nope.
-How come?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.607
-Dead.
-Do you know my mom?

08:02.690 --> 08:03.858
-No.
-How come?

08:03.941 --> 08:05.902
-Probably dead.
-How do you know?

08:05.985 --> 08:07.945
-Most people are.
-How far's Colorado?

08:08.029 --> 08:09.739
-A million miles.
-How long'll that take?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.616
I don't know 'cause I'm not taking you.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.575
How come?

08:13.784 --> 08:15.703
'Cause I got things to do.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.247
-Like what?
-Trust me, kid.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.709
Guys like me
aren't good for kids like you.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.635
Did you put out all the fires?

08:30.718 --> 08:31.969
What fires?

08:32.053 --> 08:35.640
Well, my Pubba said it was all bad people
and fires outside the fence,

08:36.390 --> 08:38.518
but I haven't seen any other fires.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.232
Finish your food.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.027
Now what?

08:48.110 --> 08:50.112
[exhales] I'm going to bed.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.364
What should I do?

08:51.447 --> 08:54.200
I don't give a shit,
as long as you're gone in the morning.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.789
[Big Man grunts]

09:04.544 --> 09:06.546
[contemplative music playing]

09:17.682 --> 09:19.850
[Big Man] Dude. Dude.

09:20.768 --> 09:21.686
Dude…

09:21.769 --> 09:25.022
Oh, no. Not my food.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.611
You little…

09:31.362 --> 09:32.196
My map!

09:33.114 --> 09:33.948
Uh…

09:34.574 --> 09:36.075
Where are these?

09:36.158 --> 09:39.245
I don't know.
I tried some, but they were gross.

09:39.829 --> 09:40.955
They made me feel funny.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.707
They're not candy.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.333
Now, where are the rest of them?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.010
Ah, damn!

09:55.636 --> 09:57.430
[Gus] But I brought extra syrup!

09:57.513 --> 09:58.472
Go home.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.224
You can have my share too!

10:00.766 --> 10:02.018
Come here.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.729
I got no medicine,
I got no way out of here,

10:04.812 --> 10:07.356
I got no water and I got no food.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.775
I get angry when I don't have food.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.862
Do you want to see what angry looks like?

10:13.654 --> 10:15.197
I know where there's food.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.414
[tense music playing]

10:46.228 --> 10:48.230
Maybe we can go in together?

10:49.857 --> 10:50.816
Get in there.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.943
[mouthing] Go in!

10:54.528 --> 10:55.404
[sighs]

10:56.989 --> 10:57.865
Don't talk…

10:57.948 --> 10:59.617
[ominous music playing]

10:59.700 --> 11:02.244
…grab food, run back.

Dad?

-[ominous music builds]

12:33.627 --> 12:34.795
[glass shattering]

12:52.229 --> 12:53.731
You get many visitors?

12:56.442 --> 12:57.359
Never.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.905
Then you can take off your masks.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.949
I don't have the Sick.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.996
If you've been isolated out here,
then you don't, either.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.876
[woman] Is the virus still out there?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.044
[Big Man] Comes and goes.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.004
-[Gus crunching]
-What about…

13:19.298 --> 13:22.134
[Big Man] Critters don't get sick
and they can't spread it, either.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.429
I don't know why
people still believe that.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.144
We don't get out much.

13:37.942 --> 13:38.859
Rusty!

13:40.694 --> 13:41.821
Not at the table.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.198
Go on to your room.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.159
Hold on.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.540
All better.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.208
Thank you.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.842
Are you Rusty's mom?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.263
-I never met a mom before.
-Don't get him started.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.934
Who taught you to talk?

14:12.017 --> 14:14.270
My Pubba did. He made me do school.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.980
I figure the Sick got him.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.066
-Do you know Birdie?
-Excuse me?

14:20.442 --> 14:22.695
My mama. We're trying to find her.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.033
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know her.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.870
She looks very nice, though.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.538
I tried to tell him,

14:32.621 --> 14:36.125
she ain't out there,
but he's stubborn as hell.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.877
How do you guys know each other?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.795
-We don't.
-He's taking me to Colorado.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.550
How old are you, Gus?

14:44.633 --> 14:46.343
I'm ten, I think.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.554
Isn't that old for one of them?

14:48.637 --> 14:49.597
How old's Rusty?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.015
He's 11.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.975
He's one of the last, uh…

14:53.058 --> 14:54.310
One of the last

14:54.393 --> 14:56.770
human babies before…

14:58.939 --> 15:00.733
Before all kids were born
like you. [titters]

15:00.816 --> 15:02.484
Can I go play with him?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.237
I… I don't know.

15:07.031 --> 15:07.865
Does he bite?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.410
Do you bite?

15:13.495 --> 15:15.998
-Go on, then, Sweet Tooth.
-[sucks fingers]

15:16.498 --> 15:17.708

[gentle music playing]

15:45.027 --> 15:47.529
Did you know
they used to send people to the moon?

15:49.198 --> 15:52.660
My dad said they used to make people
go to outer space and stuff.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.291
Have you ever been to the moon?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.293
No. I went to a mall one time.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.549
Do you poop pellets?

16:08.759 --> 16:09.635
No.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.930
Are your ears soft,
or are they gross like pig ears?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.975
