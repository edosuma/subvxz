00:02.700 --> 00:05.990
>> Announcer: Previously on "big
brother" --

00:05.990 --> 00:09.000
James and Jason became the first
two heads of household of the

00:09.000 --> 00:09.990
summer.

00:09.990 --> 00:13.990
>> I don't usually win stuff but
here I am winning an and urnt

00:13.990 --> 00:14.990
contest.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.990
>> Announcer: And they quickly
decided to work together.

00:17.990 --> 00:22.990
>> This could definitely benefit
the both of us right now.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.990
>> Announcer: Fill frz "the
amazing race" continued his

00:24.990 --> 00:30.120
takeover of the game by
unleashing the bb fast forward.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.000
>> You can't be nominatedor
evicted this week.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.990
You each get to take one
houseguest with you.

00:37.990 --> 00:40.120
>> Announcer: Leaving Vanessa
and Da'vonne with a tough

00:40.120 --> 00:46.540
decision.

00:46.540 --> 00:53.120
>> With nominations looming,
allies Audrey and Da'vonne set

00:53.120 --> 00:54.990
their sights on a target.

00:54.990 --> 00:57.990
But with no power, they had to
get the hohs on board.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.990
>> Let me tell you who we have.

01:01.990 --> 01:01.990
Yeah.

01:01.990 --> 01:04.990
Announcer: And they all
decided Jace needed to be

01:04.990 --> 01:04.990
backdoored.

01:04.990 --> 01:08.990
>> You cannot throw him on the
block.

01:08.990 --> 01:10.990
>> Jace cannot compete for the
battle of the block.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.990
He not compete for vetohñpo
you can't give him two

01:13.990 --> 01:15.540
opportunities to save himself.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.540
>> Announcer: And four pawns
were put on the block.

01:17.540 --> 01:20.990
>> I have nominated you, Johnny
and you, Becky.

01:20.990 --> 01:24.410
>> I've nominated you, Steve,
and you, Jackie.

01:24.410 --> 01:26.290
>> Announcer: And they felt
anything but safe.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.000
>> There's so many people who
have gone home because they

01:28.000 --> 01:32.990
thought they were a pawn and
promised they were safe.

01:32.990 --> 01:35.990
That promise has been broken so
many times.

01:35.990 --> 01:39.000
>> At the battle of the block
competition --

01:39.000 --> 01:39.990
>> oh!

01:39.990 --> 01:41.990
Announcer: -- Becky and
Johnny constructed a victory.

01:41.990 --> 01:42.990
>> All right!

01:42.990 --> 01:44.990
(Cheers)
>> You guys have won the battle

01:44.990 --> 01:50.990
of the block competition.

01:50.990 --> 01:50.990
>> Woo!

01:50.990 --> 01:52.830
I'm back down with the
peasants.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.990
I really am hoping that James
ends up staying with our plan

01:55.990 --> 01:58.990
and backdooring Jace.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.990
>> Announcer: Leaving Steve and
Jackie still on the block.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.990
>> I still need to do everything
in my own personal power to make

02:02.990 --> 02:06.990
sure that I win this veto so I
can save myself.

02:06.990 --> 02:09.290
>> Announcer: Tonight -- it's
the first power of veto

02:09.290 --> 02:10.830
competition of the summer.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.990
>> Woo!

02:11.990 --> 02:13.990
Announcer: Will it be used to
save either Steve or Jackie from

02:13.990 --> 02:15.290
the chopping block?

02:15.290 --> 02:19.990
And will the plan to backdoor
Jace stay on track, or will

02:19.990 --> 02:22.990
explosive emotions derail
everything?

02:22.990 --> 02:27.990
>> This is the most idiotic --
announcer: Find out right now

02:27.990 --> 02:31.990
on "big brother."

Captioning funded by CBS
♪

03:11.990 --> 03:13.000
>> You okay?

03:13.000 --> 03:13.830
Es.

03:13.830 --> 03:16.290
I have no regrets because
there is nothing more I could

03:16.290 --> 03:17.990
have done.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.990
>> I'm really dispibted that
Jackie and I lost this battle of

03:20.990 --> 03:22.990
the block because now that means
we're officially nominated.

03:22.990 --> 03:25.990
This is not a good place to be
eatsiting in the first week.

03:25.990 --> 03:28.540
>> Let me know when you need
help and I'm there.

03:28.540 --> 03:28.990
>> Jace, thank.

03:28.990 --> 03:33.990
You you're welcome, dude.

03:33.990 --> 03:38.990
Eah.

03:38.990 --> 03:43.990
I'm superexstatic after the
competition because I am not

03:43.990 --> 03:45.990
going home.

03:45.990 --> 03:48.830
Johnny is staying here this
week!

03:48.830 --> 03:49.000
>> It's phenomenal.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.290
And now you're safe.

03:56.990 --> 03:59.990
How many votes do we need to
get Jace out?

03:59.990 --> 04:03.540
>> This week there is 16 of us.

04:03.540 --> 04:03.990
16.

04:03.990 --> 04:07.540
And three can't vote, the two
nominees.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.830
13 votes, so we need seven.

04:11.830 --> 04:12.990
>> At least, minimum.

04:12.990 --> 04:13.990
Minimum of seven.

04:13.990 --> 04:13.990
Yeah.

04:13.990 --> 04:18.990
If we're going to backdoor
Jace, we need to secure votes.

04:18.990 --> 04:18.990
>> Yeah.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.990
If we have seven, we'll have
them all.

04:20.990 --> 04:24.990
We'll have all 13.

04:24.990 --> 04:25.990
>> Jason, Audrey and Da'vonne.

04:25.990 --> 04:29.990
If I want to get Jace out of
here, I got go rally up some

04:29.990 --> 04:30.830
more troops.

04:30.830 --> 04:35.990
>> Just got to get everybody in
our alliance we're about to form

04:35.990 --> 04:36.990
somehow.

04:36.990 --> 04:38.990
Just got to go around the house
and scoop people up the first

04:38.990 --> 04:41.990
people that pops up in my mind
is definitely Meg.

04:41.990 --> 04:42.990
She's got a good personality.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.990
She gets along win everybody.

04:44.990 --> 04:48.990
Plus, she looks like Taylor
swift.

04:48.990 --> 04:57.990
Can't be too bad.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.990
>> Right now there's no
commitment.

04:59.990 --> 05:03.990
>> I, like, know that I face to
face talk to you about this

05:03.990 --> 05:08.990
stuff.Ñi
who do we have?

05:08.990 --> 05:09.990
Da' and Audrey.

05:09.990 --> 05:10.990
>> Audrey.

05:10.990 --> 05:10.990
Jason.

05:10.990 --> 05:11.950
Yes.

05:11.950 --> 05:11.990
You.

05:11.990 --> 05:13.000
>> Me.

05:13.000 --> 05:13.990
You.

05:13.990 --> 05:16.830
>> Five.

05:16.830 --> 05:21.990
James, king of the household
has approached me.

05:21.990 --> 05:24.990
An official alliance is about to
happen.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.990
>> We shall have a convo.

05:26.990 --> 05:27.830
Definitely.

05:27.830 --> 05:35.990
I've also beenñiíy:A thinking he
would be a good asset for the

05:35.990 --> 05:35.990
team.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.000
He's from Texas.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.990
>> You know it's going to be
flipping and flopping and

05:40.990 --> 05:45.990
nobody's got -- it's gotñi be --
>> okay.

05:45.990 --> 05:49.540
The more you get, the more
people leak out.

05:49.540 --> 05:49.990
>> I got you.

05:49.990 --> 05:55.990
So what do you think about you,
me, Audrey, da', Jason and

05:55.990 --> 05:58.700
Meg?

05:58.700 --> 05:59.990
>> So Jason's hoh.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.290
He talks to me about working
together.

06:01.290 --> 06:01.990
I like the guy.

06:01.990 --> 06:03.990
I feel like I can trust him.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.990
I'm excited about potentially
working with this guy.

06:06.990 --> 06:07.990
>> We've got trust each other.

06:07.990 --> 06:08.990
It's got to be solid.

06:08.990 --> 06:29.990
>> Yeah.Ñr
(Doorbell)

06:29.990 --> 06:31.990
>> Thank God it's you.

06:31.990 --> 06:38.990
We got the whole group here.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.990
Keep it like that.

06:40.990 --> 06:43.990
This group is definitely very
temporary.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.000
It's shaky.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.990
It's not going to be solid at
all whatsoever.

06:46.990 --> 06:50.990
Now, there are players in here
that I do actually want to have

06:50.990 --> 06:53.410
a solid alliance with and take
to the end.

06:53.410 --> 06:57.990
But that whole group in itself,
no.

06:57.990 --> 07:00.990
>> I can tell you right now I
know Jace, if he doesn't go

07:00.990 --> 07:03.830
home, it's going to come out
that somebody tried to backdoor

07:03.830 --> 07:06.990
him this week.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.990
>> This is who we want.

07:08.990 --> 07:14.990
End of story.

07:14.990 --> 07:19.700
>> Good, good.

07:19.700 --> 07:25.990
I have never been --
just don't drop me.

07:25.990 --> 07:30.990
One, two, three.

07:30.990 --> 07:31.700
(Shouting).

07:31.700 --> 07:36.990
>> Oh, my God.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.990
Jace comes blading in the
backyard streaking, and I think

07:39.990 --> 07:43.990
he was hoping for, like,
everyone to, like, start

07:43.990 --> 07:44.120
laughing and everything.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.990
But it was actually sort of half
chuckles and crickets.

07:46.990 --> 07:52.990
I'm just really not sure if it's
a smart move and I'm not sure --

07:52.990 --> 07:54.990
>> ah!

07:54.990 --> 07:56.990
Oh, my gosh.

07:56.990 --> 07:57.990
God.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.540
I'm mortified.

07:59.540 --> 08:00.990
I don't think it can get any
worse.

08:00.990 --> 08:02.990
Jace, you need to keep your
cool.

08:02.990 --> 08:04.990
This is going to blow back on
me.

08:04.990 --> 08:16.410
I'm your boy, and when do you
stuff, I'm associated with it.

08:16.410 --> 08:18.990
>> I don't know.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.540
He seemed annoyed by.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.990
>> You annoyed by me?

08:21.990 --> 08:22.120
Seemed like it.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.830
I'm noticing some buzz around
the house.

08:24.830 --> 08:27.950
Jace is a very vocal person and
I see him getting on people's

08:27.950 --> 08:31.990
nerves so I got to do what I can
to keep my boy completely safe

08:31.990 --> 08:36.000
this week.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.990
>> It's all about the hoh.

08:37.990 --> 08:41.700
'M thinking that if Jace is
a target this week on anyone's

08:41.700 --> 08:44.990
radar, we need to nip this in
the bud now and go talk to the

08:44.990 --> 08:51.990
hoh.

08:51.990 --> 09:01.950
>> What's going on?

09:01.950 --> 09:01.990
Chillin', man.

09:01.990 --> 09:06.410
I just wanna get a big target
out.

09:06.410 --> 09:07.990
>> It's all over the place.

09:07.990 --> 09:17.990
We want to get a big target
out.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.990
>> Thktlm
if I'm hoh next week, I'd

09:21.990 --> 09:25.990
rather be with you or someone I
can trust because we can make

09:25.990 --> 09:26.990
game decisions together.

09:26.990 --> 09:30.990
I don't want to be with somebody
I don't like.

09:30.990 --> 09:31.990
>> Talking about this week.

09:31.990 --> 09:31.990
Yeah.

09:31.990 --> 09:34.290
And using the veto.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.990
Getting out a big target.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.990
>> Even if you take somebody out
that you think is a big move

09:37.990 --> 09:40.700
this week it's not going to be a
big move because there's so many

09:40.700 --> 09:42.990
more weeks to come that it's
just going to be whatever.

09:42.990 --> 09:45.990
There's no -- nothing big enough
has happened for it to be a big

09:45.990 --> 09:47.950
move, like, week one.

09:47.950 --> 09:51.990
>> Well, it would be a big move
to backdoor the other hoh.

09:51.990 --> 09:53.990
>> Oh, my God.

09:53.990 --> 09:57.990
I throw out Jason's name to
Jace because basically right now

09:57.990 --> 10:01.990
we just need to tell him
whatever it --ñh&

10:01.990 --> 10:02.990
it is he wants to buy.

10:02.990 --> 10:05.950
>> I got your back next week for
sure.

10:05.950 --> 10:06.990
>> That's what I'm saying.

10:06.990 --> 10:08.990
I already guaranteed you're
good.

10:08.990 --> 10:08.990
>> I got your back.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.830
You got my back.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.990
>> You are my head of household.

10:13.990 --> 10:14.990
I'm in your court.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.410
M playing for you there's noyl"ñ
reason why we can't have each

10:18.410 --> 10:20.990
other's back for a while too,
you know?

10:20.990 --> 10:23.950
>> Are we an alliance that's
probably going to need to be

10:23.950 --> 10:24.540
formed.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.990
>> I mean, I feel comfortable
right now.

10:27.990 --> 10:33.990
I'm liking this.

10:33.990 --> 10:35.000
>> Cloud 9 alliance.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.990
The cloud squad.

10:36.990 --> 10:40.990
>> Cloud squad.

10:40.990 --> 10:40.990
10.

10:40.990 --> 10:41.990
Town.

10:41.990 --> 10:44.990
I like cloud town.

10:44.990 --> 10:46.700
Cloud town?

10:46.700 --> 10:47.990
Jace is a wildcard right now.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.990
He's trying to throw lifelines.

10:50.990 --> 10:54.990
He's trying to do anything he
can right now to ensure his

10:54.990 --> 10:54.990
safety.

10:54.990 --> 10:55.990
Jace can say whatever he wants.

10:55.990 --> 10:58.990
He can say that we're in an
alliance.

10:58.990 --> 10:59.990
I'm going to agree with the guy.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.830
But in the long run, when a veto
ceremony comes up, he's going to

11:03.830 --> 11:08.990
find out that I'm not in the
alliance, buddy.

11:08.990 --> 11:09.120
>> Cloud town.

11:09.120 --> 11:09.990
That's pretty good.

11:09.990 --> 11:12.990
I feel like I'm flying right
now.

11:12.990 --> 11:14.000
>> Cloud town.

11:22.410 --> 11:23.990
>> Everybody, time to pick
players for the very first veto

11:23.990 --> 11:23.990
competition this summer!

11:23.990 --> 11:33.120
(Cheers)
Only six people were

11:33.120 --> 11:34.990
participating in the veto
competition.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.990
The head of household, the two
nominees and three other players

11:37.990 --> 11:39.990
selected by random draw.

11:39.990 --> 11:48.990
Will the nominees please join me
up here.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.990
As hoh, I will pick first.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.990
I have a backdoor plan in
motion.

11:53.990 --> 11:58.120
The worst thing that could
happen at this point is Austin

11:58.120 --> 12:00.990
or Jace get picked to play for
the veto.

12:00.990 --> 12:01.990
First chip, Becky.

12:01.990 --> 12:15.120
(Applause)
>> John.

12:15.120 --> 12:27.410
(Applause)
>> Jason.

12:27.410 --> 12:32.990
(Applause)
I picked Jason because I haven't

12:32.990 --> 12:34.990
spend too much time bonding with
him.

12:34.990 --> 12:36.990
I think I can use that
connection to bond with him in

12:36.990 --> 12:37.990
the future.

12:37.990 --> 12:42.990
>> I also have to choose a host
for the veto competition and I

12:42.990 --> 12:45.990
choose Austin.

12:45.990 --> 12:46.990
(Cheers and applause).

12:46.990 --> 12:46.990
>> Yeah!

12:46.990 --> 12:46.990
Yeah!

12:46.990 --> 12:47.990
Yeah!

12:47.990 --> 12:49.990
Yeah!

12:49.990 --> 12:53.990
>> Look at them guys over there
celebrating.

12:53.990 --> 12:54.990
You only got picked for the
veto.

12:54.990 --> 12:56.990
What are you celebrating for,
man?

12:56.990 --> 13:01.990
You might as well pack your
bags.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.990
"Big brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

13:03.990 --> 13:03.990
begin.

13:03.990 --> 13:04.410
Good luck.

13:04.410 --> 13:19.990
(Applause)
>> Do we know -- knowing the

13:19.990 --> 13:22.990
game of "big brother," I know at
some point along the line there

13:22.990 --> 13:24.990
is going to be a counting
competition.

13:24.990 --> 13:26.990
So I'm walking around the house
and I'm counting different

13:26.990 --> 13:26.990
things.

13:26.990 --> 13:47.990
I want to be on point because
I'm trying to win.

13:47.990 --> 13:56.410
>> Da' just walked in there.

13:56.410 --> 13:56.990
Who's in here?

13:56.990 --> 13:58.000
Nobody.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.990
What are you doing in there?

13:59.990 --> 14:00.990
I live here!

14:00.990 --> 14:03.990
I can't just walk around the
house?

14:03.990 --> 14:07.990
>> Were you just creepin' in our
room?

14:07.990 --> 14:16.990
>> Whoever told you could have
came and asked me themself.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.990
>> I am livid.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.830
All of the inglewood is about to
pop out of my system.

14:21.830 --> 14:22.990
I'm livid.

14:22.990 --> 14:25.990
First of all, it's not your
room, boo.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.950
Your house just like the rest of
us.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.990
Your lease is up probably next
week because I plan on sending

14:29.990 --> 14:30.990
your ass home.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.950
But you going to have to leave
eventually too.

14:32.950 --> 14:40.990
You don't own no room up in
here.

14:40.990 --> 14:41.990
>> I go in there.

14:41.990 --> 14:43.990
I'm counting the cards.

14:43.990 --> 14:49.990
I hear shelli say, go in there.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.830
He's coming in.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.120
As he's coming in, I'm coming
out.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.990
He goes, you were just creeping
in our room?

14:56.990 --> 15:00.290
He wanted to know why I was in
there and I looked dead at Clay

15:00.290 --> 15:01.990
and I looked dead at shelli.

15:01.990 --> 15:04.990
I don't trust either one of
them.

15:04.990 --> 15:08.990
The fact that Clay was in that
room because this much really

15:08.990 --> 15:10.990
trusted Clay.

15:10.990 --> 15:11.990
Mama da'.

15:11.990 --> 15:15.990
>> Yes, mama da', done.

15:15.990 --> 15:15.990
Holla.

15:15.990 --> 15:19.990
That chick from inglewood, she
here.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.990
>> I know I need to do some
damage control.

15:21.990 --> 15:26.540
The last thing I need right now
is an enemy especially over

15:26.540 --> 15:27.990
something so small.

15:27.990 --> 15:32.990
Mama da', I'm not going to lie
you scare the [ Bleep ] out of

15:32.990 --> 15:32.990
me.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.990
>> You pissed me off with what
you said.

15:34.990 --> 15:35.990
>> It was kind of creepy.

15:35.990 --> 15:36.000
No, it wasn't.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.990
We all live here.

15:36.990 --> 15:37.990
>> We all live here.

15:37.990 --> 15:38.700
I know.

15:38.700 --> 15:38.990
I'm sorry.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.990
I wanted to come and up
apologize.

15:40.990 --> 15:41.990
>> You're right.

15:41.990 --> 15:43.990
, though.

15:43.990 --> 15:44.990
You can do whatever.

15:44.990 --> 15:45.990
>> I'm not even mad at you.

15:45.990 --> 15:46.990
Going to say.

15:46.990 --> 15:49.990
Know you're not but I heard
it because I was standing by the

15:49.990 --> 15:50.290
door.

15:50.290 --> 15:50.990
It's out there.

15:50.990 --> 15:51.990
So I know.

15:51.990 --> 15:53.990
>> Okay.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.540
You're just hanging out?

15:55.540 --> 15:55.990
Eah.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.540
I'm about to take a nap.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.990
Yeah, we did too.

15:58.990 --> 16:02.990
Enjoy your that.

16:02.990 --> 16:10.990
Thank you.

16:10.990 --> 16:26.990
He came over here to do
damage control.

16:26.990 --> 16:29.410
>> You apologized.

16:29.410 --> 16:31.990
I was like, okay.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.000
Like, what?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.990
Dude, she's like a puppet
master.

16:34.990 --> 16:38.990
We got to make sure --
>> I know, now know.

16:38.990 --> 16:42.990
-- I know.

16:42.990 --> 16:46.950
>> Yeah, just wait.

16:46.950 --> 16:48.990
I'm so frustrated right now.

16:48.990 --> 16:52.990
I know in in game, play with
your emotions and fighting fire

16:52.990 --> 16:55.990
with fire will not get you
anywhere but sent back home.

16:55.990 --> 16:57.990
I don't want to go home yet.

16:57.990 --> 16:59.990
So I have to be apologetic.

16:59.990 --> 17:00.990
I have to be on her side.

17:00.990 --> 17:03.990
And I have to make her think
that she's right.

17:03.990 --> 17:09.950
>> Oh, hey.

17:09.950 --> 17:16.990
What's going on?

17:16.990 --> 17:18.950
Clay marches his ass
upstairs.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.700
I don't even know who he was.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.990
His whole tone changed.

17:22.990 --> 17:28.000
He got some deep faith in his
voice he never had since he been

17:28.000 --> 17:28.990
in this house.

17:28.990 --> 17:30.830
>> Can you tell me what's going
on?

17:30.830 --> 17:30.990
>> Regarding?

17:30.990 --> 17:32.990
I don't know.

17:32.990 --> 17:38.990
About you and --
>> I said whoever sent you in

17:38.990 --> 17:40.990
here should have asked me
personally.

17:40.990 --> 17:41.990
>> Nobody sent anyone in the
room.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.410
>> He said it himself.

17:43.410 --> 17:43.990
No, he didn't.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.990
You weren't up here when he
said it.

17:45.990 --> 17:47.990
So how you going to say no he
didn't?

17:47.990 --> 17:50.990
>> He just told me -- I said
what's going on?

17:50.990 --> 17:54.990
He said da''s freaking out
saying like we sent you in there

17:54.990 --> 17:58.990
to see what you were
doing.

17:58.990 --> 18:03.120
(Stammering)
Wha>> what you stuttering for

18:03.120 --> 18:04.990
because your ass is lying!

18:04.990 --> 18:08.540
>> When he came up here, did he
or did he not say he was

18:08.540 --> 18:10.290
basically sent into the room to
see what I was doing?

18:10.290 --> 18:10.990
>> Yeah.

18:10.990 --> 18:10.990
Thank you.

18:10.990 --> 18:11.120
Okay.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.410
That's fine.

18:12.410 --> 18:14.990
>> So what do you feel
trusttrated with me for?

18:14.990 --> 18:15.990
The problem should be with the
person --

18:15.990 --> 18:19.990
>> you make a comment -- the way
you made a comment like that and

18:19.990 --> 18:23.990
trying to say -- your attitude
is just so negative.

18:23.990 --> 18:24.990
>> Was I accurate?

18:24.990 --> 18:30.830
I was right with what I said so
why was I wrong?

18:30.830 --> 18:34.990
>> The point is your attitude
and how you approached the

18:34.990 --> 18:35.990
situation was completely wrong.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.990
I thought we were close in this
house.

18:37.990 --> 18:37.990
>> I thought we were too.

18:37.990 --> 18:41.000
So you think I sent him in to
spy you?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.990
>> I don't know if you sent him
in there.

18:42.990 --> 18:45.000
But I know he came in there
because someone sent him in

18:45.000 --> 18:45.990
there.

18:45.990 --> 18:45.990
>> Okay.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.410
This is the most idiotic
conversation.

18:48.410 --> 18:48.990
>> Then stop having it.

18:48.990 --> 18:50.990
It's simple.

18:50.990 --> 18:52.700
Don't lie to my face.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.990
I don't like being lied to.

18:55.990 --> 18:59.990
And then try make it seem like
it was my fault like I was

18:59.990 --> 18:59.990
negative.

18:59.990 --> 19:02.120
Why am I negative because I
called you out on your [ Bleep ]

19:02.120 --> 19:05.000
Or because you're caught?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.990
>> You're right.

19:06.990 --> 19:08.990
Are paranoid completely
without a doubt.

19:08.990 --> 19:10.990
>> I don't have to be paranoid
when people come in here and

19:10.990 --> 19:11.990
tell me.

19:11.990 --> 19:14.990
>> Okay.

19:14.990 --> 19:14.990
Good day.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.410
Good luck.

19:16.410 --> 19:16.990
>> Mama da'.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.410
I don't know why you're so
paranoid.

19:19.410 --> 19:35.410
Going to get you evicted
eventually.

19:35.410 --> 19:36.290
>> Am I trippin'?

19:36.290 --> 19:37.990
No.

19:37.990 --> 19:40.990
I'm even more pissed off that
you would sit here and try to

19:40.990 --> 19:46.990
paint a picture of me being
negative and you know you wrong.

19:46.990 --> 19:53.990
He apologized, apologized.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.290
>> Don't be upset, girl.

19:55.290 --> 19:58.990
We literally just brought
Clay into our alliance and now

19:58.990 --> 20:01.990
this fight could just blow
everything up.

20:01.990 --> 20:02.990
>> So mad.

20:02.990 --> 20:03.990
I know, I know.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.990
'M so mad.

20:05.990 --> 20:09.990
Even though you know your
feelings are valid, don't let

20:09.990 --> 20:11.990
them see that side of you.

20:11.990 --> 20:14.990
I would just collect yourself,
remember you're here for a

20:14.990 --> 20:14.990
prize.

20:14.990 --> 20:15.830
>> Right.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.830
You're here for your
daughter.

20:18.830 --> 20:18.990
>> Right.

20:18.990 --> 20:22.000
While Da'vonne is flipping
out, on the inside, I am just

20:22.000 --> 20:25.990
screaming, girlfriend, get it
together.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.990
Moving feared, I know that
she's -- forward, I know that

20:27.990 --> 20:29.990
she's going to be a major
liability to may game.

20:29.990 --> 20:33.990
>> Put on your game face.

20:43.990 --> 20:45.990
>> She shouldn't have reacted
like that.

20:45.990 --> 20:46.700
>> No.

20:46.700 --> 20:47.990
What are you going to do?

20:47.990 --> 20:49.990
Go apologize because she started
crying.

20:49.990 --> 20:51.290
>> She did?

20:51.290 --> 20:53.990
Yeah, she was like bawling.

20:53.990 --> 20:55.990
She's got go, though.

20:55.990 --> 20:57.990
Okay.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.990
I'm totally down with that.

21:00.990 --> 21:06.700
I'm not going to be the one to
do it.

21:06.700 --> 21:10.990
>> I'm extremely frustrated that
this has blown up to this point.

21:10.990 --> 21:13.540
But I have to do some damage
control and some major sucking

21:13.540 --> 21:29.990
and up some major apologizing
even if it's not sincere.

21:29.990 --> 21:30.990
>> I understand, you were upset.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.990
You were angry.

21:32.990 --> 21:34.990
You thought maybe I might be
sketchy.

21:34.990 --> 21:38.700
I should never talk to a woman
like that.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.990
I shouldn't have attacked you.

21:40.990 --> 21:49.000
>> I appreciate that.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.990
Let me collect my thoughts
and I'll meet you downstairs.

21:52.990 --> 21:53.000
>> Okay.

21:53.000 --> 21:53.990
Thank you.

21:53.990 --> 22:04.990
I appreciate it.

22:04.990 --> 22:05.990
>> You're a liar.

22:05.990 --> 22:09.990
And I know that Audrey went down
there and told him the same

22:09.990 --> 22:17.700
thing she told me to go
apologize.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.990
I'm very irritate with Audrey at
this point because I'm thinking

22:20.990 --> 22:23.410
to myself, you're trying to
manipulate me right now.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.290
You're trying to be a puppet
master.

22:26.290 --> 22:27.290
Bye, go to bed.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.990
>> Oh, my God.

22:47.990 --> 22:52.990
An.

22:52.990 --> 22:53.990
The vetoes.

22:53.990 --> 22:59.700
Oh, my -- what is that?

22:59.700 --> 23:02.000
Congratulations, James, on
being the sole remaining head of

23:02.000 --> 23:02.990
household.

23:02.990 --> 23:06.990
With this power becomes the
responsibility of naming the

23:06.990 --> 23:08.990
first four have-nots of the
summer.

23:08.990 --> 23:11.990
Make your decision now so they
can enjoy some slap and check

23:11.990 --> 23:15.000
out their new bedroom.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.830
(Cheers)
>> Being a have-not means you

23:20.830 --> 23:21.990
have to eat slop all week.

23:21.990 --> 23:24.990
You have to take cold showers
and you have to sleep in a

23:24.990 --> 23:26.990
horrible bed, and nobody wants
to do that.

23:26.990 --> 23:36.990
>> We have the bb fast forward
weekend so you're all safe, Liz,

23:36.990 --> 23:38.990
Austin and da'.

23:38.990 --> 23:38.990
>> Ooh.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.990
Whatever.

23:41.990 --> 23:43.410
Slop is extremely bland.

23:43.410 --> 23:46.990
We're going to have to get
creative to make this taste like

23:46.990 --> 23:50.990
anything remotely edible.

23:50.990 --> 23:54.990
>> Let's go see our room!

Oh, my God.

23:55.990 --> 24:00.990
That's horrible!

24:00.990 --> 24:00.990
>> No.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.990
Oh, my God it's a dentist
office!

24:02.990 --> 24:04.990
It's a dentist office.

24:04.990 --> 24:07.990
>> This is the dentist's office
from hell.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.830
The equipment's outdated.

24:09.830 --> 24:11.950
The chairs don't even work.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.990
This isn't a dentist I would
want to go see.

24:14.990 --> 24:16.990
>> This is terrible.

24:16.990 --> 24:18.700
Oh, my --
this not cool.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.950
-- God.

24:19.950 --> 24:23.990
Little weird with the creepy
sterile-looking dentist

24:23.990 --> 24:23.990

24:23.990 --> 24:39.540
It's like the perfect storm to
make you a basket case.

24:39.540 --> 24:39.990
>> Yeah.

24:39.990 --> 24:40.410
Hey, everybody.

24:40.410 --> 24:48.990
It's time for the first veto
competition of the summer.

24:48.990 --> 24:50.990
>> Meet me in the ward.

24:50.990 --> 24:51.990

>> when I walk the into the back

25:00.700 --> 25:04.410
yoord, it was just like
Colorado.

25:04.410 --> 25:08.990
I feel at home.

Gross.

>> You are traveling to the
province of Nova Scotia ya where

25:12.990 --> 25:15.990
there has been a recent
discovery of gold nuggets in

25:15.990 --> 25:16.990
this Mountain terrain.

25:16.990 --> 25:22.700
It's your job to dig for gold in
the hopes of veto fortune.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.000
Here's how it works.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.990
On go, make your way through the
obstacle to search the Mountain

25:27.990 --> 25:31.990
and locate a gold nugget.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.990
Each nugget has a letter with a
point value ranging from 00 to 3

25:36.990 --> 25:36.990
points.

25:36.990 --> 25:40.540
Once you pick one that you like,
bring it back to your gold pan

25:40.540 --> 25:42.290
to begin spelling a word.

25:42.290 --> 25:46.990
You may only bring back one
letter at a time.

25:46.990 --> 25:50.700
Once you feel confident with the
word you spelled, press your

25:50.700 --> 25:52.990
button lock in your answer and
time.

25:52.990 --> 25:55.990
To win the power of veto, you
must correctly spell the word

25:55.990 --> 25:59.990
with letters that add up to the
highest point value.

25:59.990 --> 26:04.990
But beware, you only have ten
minutes to lock in your answer.

26:04.990 --> 26:05.990
>> Wow.

26:05.990 --> 26:10.990
Are you ready to play nova
scotia?

26:10.990 --> 26:13.990
(Cheers)
>> Winning this veto competition

26:13.990 --> 26:20.990
is really important because I
don't know if he can believe him

26:20.990 --> 26:25.990
and the only way to know whether
he's lying or not is to win this

26:25.990 --> 26:26.540
veto.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.990

Jumping through the water and
digging in the noses which were

26:44.830 --> 26:49.410
covered in grossness, this is a
dirty comp.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.990
I am absolutely atrocious at
spelling.

26:51.990 --> 26:55.990
My strategy is to just get as
many letters as I can and find

26:55.990 --> 26:59.990
any word that I can actually
spell.

26:59.990 --> 27:01.990
Go to college kids.

27:28.990 --> 27:29.990
out what word can I spell?

And it hits me and I have the
perfect word to use.

Oh, God.

Steve got some bans on his
knees that he is ripping off and

5-year-old loses his band-aid.

>> James, everybody out of the
pool!

28:15.990 --> 28:21.990

we have complete power over the
house this week.

29:06.540 --> 29:14.990

He's good at that.

super close to the end of the

29:36.990 --> 29:36.990
game.

29:36.990 --> 29:39.990
I don't think have any time to
make any meaningful additions to

29:39.990 --> 29:47.990
my word so I guess it's time to
lock it in.

29:47.990 --> 29:48.000
>> James.

29:48.000 --> 29:48.990
All right.

29:48.990 --> 29:49.990
Everyone is locked in.

James, let's start with you.

>> I have spelled lifeguards.

That's a correctly spelled
eight-point word.

Are you in the lead.

>> I just hope I got the most
points so I can win this veto.

30:17.990 --> 30:27.990
>> Becky, what word have you
spelled?

30:27.990 --> 30:31.290
>> That is a correctly
seven-point word.

30:31.290 --> 30:35.990
Unfortunately it's not enough to
beat James.

30:35.990 --> 30:37.990
>> What word did you spell
Jason?

30:37.990 --> 30:38.990
>> I spelled zone.

30:38.990 --> 30:41.290
That's a correctly spelled
six-point word.

30:41.290 --> 30:42.990
Unfortunately, it is not enough
to beat James.

30:42.990 --> 30:49.000
(Buzzer)
>> Jackie.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.990
I have spelled the word
judge.

30:54.990 --> 30:58.830
>> Jackie, that is a
correctly-spelled six-point

30:58.830 --> 30:58.990
word.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.990
Unfortunately, it is not enough
to beat James.

31:00.990 --> 31:04.990
(Buzzer)
>> You'd think Jackie would be a

31:04.990 --> 31:12.990
pro navigating around nova
scotia, from being on the "the

31:12.990 --> 31:13.410
amazing race."

31:13.410 --> 31:14.990
Came up short once again.

word to beat James.

31:17.990 --> 31:19.990
>> Looking at my competition
right now, I see Steve.

31:19.990 --> 31:21.990
I know he's smart.

31:21.990 --> 31:24.990
He probably scored a 6,000 on
his s.A.T.S.

31:24.990 --> 31:26.830
I'm kind of worried right now.

31:26.830 --> 31:27.990
>> What word did you spell?

31:27.990 --> 31:32.540
I spelled my favorite people.

31:32.540 --> 31:37.990
(Cheers)
>> That is a correctly spelled

31:37.990 --> 31:38.990
12-point word.

31:38.990 --> 31:43.700
And you are now in the lead.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.990
>> Wow.

31:45.990 --> 31:50.410
Out of all the words in the
dictionnary, Steve comes up with

31:50.410 --> 31:50.990
trombonist.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.990
I can't even spell that now.

31:52.990 --> 31:53.950
>> All right, everyone.

31:53.950 --> 31:56.990
It all comes down to this.

31:56.990 --> 32:01.990
John, let's see if you can beat
Steve's 12-point word.

32:01.990 --> 32:04.990
>> I'm just hoping that my word
is worth enough points to win

32:04.990 --> 32:04.990
this competition.

32:04.990 --> 32:08.990
This is my one chance to not
have to trust James and I can

32:08.990 --> 32:12.990
rely on myself to pull myself
off the block.

32:12.990 --> 32:20.000
>> I spelled a treasure anyone
can dig for.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.990
Booger.

32:22.990 --> 32:26.990
(Applause)
>> John that is a correctly

32:26.990 --> 32:30.120
spelled seven-point word but
that's not enough to beat Steve.

32:30.120 --> 32:33.700
(Cheers and applause)
>> All right, Steve, with a

32:33.700 --> 32:37.290
12-point word, you are won the
golden power of veto.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.410
>> Yeah!

32:38.410 --> 32:39.990
Woo!

32:39.990 --> 32:41.990
I won the veto this week.

32:41.990 --> 32:42.990
I am super stoked.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.990
It means I'm not going to be the
first person out of this game,

32:44.990 --> 32:52.990
and I am really relieved and
it's a huge burden off my

32:52.990 --> 32:52.990
shoulders.

32:52.990 --> 32:55.990
This guy is not going anywhere
this week.

32:55.990 --> 32:59.950
>> So Steve wins the veto, and I
know he's going to use it on

32:59.950 --> 32:59.990
himself.

32:59.990 --> 33:03.990
So now all I hope is James puts
up an even bigger target next to

33:03.990 --> 33:05.990
me so I still have a fighting
chance this week.

33:05.990 --> 33:11.990
>> Guys, I think we're on the
first ones to spell all the

33:11.990 --> 33:12.000
words right.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.990
>> Steve won the power of veto.

33:13.990 --> 33:14.700
That's awesome.

33:14.700 --> 33:15.990
He's going to pull himself off
the block.

33:15.990 --> 33:16.990
Jace is still my target and I'm
going for the kill.

33:24.990 --> 33:25.990
>> Julie: Be a fly on the wall

Es.

33:49.990 --> 33:50.000
Cool.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.990
I won the veto this week.

33:51.990 --> 33:52.990
I am super stoked about it.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.990
I'm not gonna be the first
person out of this game.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.990
>> That was very impressive.

33:57.990 --> 34:00.410
I think it's the longest word in
bb history.

34:00.410 --> 34:00.990
>> No, I didn't.

34:00.990 --> 34:02.990
Who did?

34:02.990 --> 34:03.410
Understanding.

34:03.410 --> 34:04.700
What is it?

34:04.700 --> 34:04.990
Understanding.

34:04.990 --> 34:08.990
Oh, my God.

34:08.990 --> 34:12.120
That word, dude.

34:12.120 --> 34:12.990
Rombonist.

34:12.990 --> 34:18.830
My mind was blown.

34:18.830 --> 34:22.120
Wow.

34:22.120 --> 34:26.950
Oh.

34:26.950 --> 34:32.990
Whew!

34:32.990 --> 34:34.700
Short-term problem solved.

34:34.700 --> 34:37.990
Now I have negotiating power.

34:37.990 --> 34:47.990
Now I can solve a long-term
problem.

34:47.990 --> 34:54.990
I can be part of the house right
now.

34:54.990 --> 34:57.990
>> After this blowup between
da' and Clay, I feel like it's

34:57.990 --> 35:01.990
really important to start lining
the troop, because there is

35:01.990 --> 35:04.990
cracks in our alliance, I'm
really trying to put together

35:04.990 --> 35:05.990
the numbers for us.

35:05.990 --> 35:10.990
But I have to be really subtle
about it.

35:10.990 --> 35:13.990
>> Listen, I want this to work.

35:13.990 --> 35:13.990
Right.

35:13.990 --> 35:14.990
And we need numbers.

35:14.990 --> 35:18.990
We need people that we can count
on.

35:18.990 --> 35:19.990
>> Audrey, what is going on?

35:19.990 --> 35:20.990
I'll be right back.

35:20.990 --> 35:23.990
She's talking about all kind
of crazy stuff.

35:23.990 --> 35:47.950
Audrey, who you think's the head
of household?

35:47.950 --> 35:49.990
>> So the first person I snatch
is shelli.

35:49.990 --> 35:51.990
I have felt close to shelli
since day one.

35:51.990 --> 35:58.540
And this is the most opportune
moment for me to drag her in.

35:58.540 --> 35:59.990
>> Hey, princess.

35:59.990 --> 36:07.990
There has been a lot of weird
behavior amongst a lot of

36:07.990 --> 36:11.990
people, and it would help us if
you would work with us.

36:11.990 --> 36:13.990
(Laughter)
>> Whoa.

36:13.990 --> 36:16.990
With an offer like that --
(Laughter)

36:16.990 --> 36:18.990
Okay.

36:18.990 --> 36:21.990
>> Shelli's in our alliance now.

36:21.990 --> 36:22.990
Thanks, Audrey.

36:22.990 --> 36:24.990
I guess you're just going to
pick and choose do & do what you

36:24.990 --> 36:25.990
want.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.990
>> Okay.

36:27.990 --> 36:28.830
I'll go get Jess.

36:28.830 --> 36:29.990
>> I am like the sandman.

36:29.990 --> 36:32.290
Is I am just collecting people
from their beds.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.990
Jess brings a lot to the group.

36:33.990 --> 36:33.990
He's smart.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.540
He's a great competitor.

36:35.540 --> 36:43.990
D he ha has a great social game.

36:45.990 --> 36:51.990
>> Here I am, getting to know
Meg, having a little pillow talk

36:51.990 --> 37:08.830
at 5:00 in the morning, and
then, of course, Audrey.

37:08.830 --> 37:12.540
>> I wish I can tell you how I
really feel but there would be

37:12.540 --> 37:18.290
too many curse words about the
situation.

37:18.290 --> 37:19.990
>> Take a seat.

37:19.990 --> 37:23.990
Until "big brother" history,
I know it's never good to have a

37:23.990 --> 37:26.410
six-team person alliance which
if we keep going, it's gonna

37:26.410 --> 37:26.990
happen.

37:26.990 --> 37:28.990
And what are we doing?

37:28.990 --> 37:29.990
>> What's up?

37:29.990 --> 37:32.950
Next week, it's going to be a
whole different game.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.830
We don't know what the place is
going to be like.

37:34.830 --> 37:35.990
>> It's going to be a blood
bath.

37:35.990 --> 37:38.990
>> This is the thing, like, how
do we know for sure that we can

37:38.990 --> 37:41.990
trust you?

37:41.990 --> 37:43.990
>> With that being said, what
are we trying to accomplish?

37:43.990 --> 37:45.990
That's what I want to know.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.990
What point are we trying to make
and what do we need to do and

37:48.990 --> 37:50.990
what do we need to do to get it
done?

37:50.990 --> 37:52.990
>> Stick with the original plan.

37:52.990 --> 37:53.990
Why can't it wait till the
next morning.

37:53.990 --> 37:57.410
Audrey is the biggest sketchball
in the world.

37:57.410 --> 38:02.990
>> I'll be right back.

38:09.990 --> 38:14.990
Go up there.

38:14.990 --> 38:19.990
Everybody go up there right now.

38:26.990 --> 38:28.990
>> Oh, mylanta.

38:28.990 --> 38:29.950
Good morning, guys.

38:29.950 --> 38:30.990
I'm so tired.

38:30.990 --> 38:32.990
Miserable right now.

38:32.990 --> 38:35.000
Think this is the most
dramatic event ever.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.990
I feel like I'm in some weird
secret book club that's not

38:43.990 --> 38:45.990
allowed to ask, what is
happening?

38:45.990 --> 38:48.950
>> All I want to say is I feel
like we've all been trying to do

38:48.950 --> 38:53.540
the best we can to work
together.

38:53.540 --> 38:57.950
This needs to be like a
solidified for sure group.

38:57.950 --> 39:03.540
And so now that we're all on the
same page, it's really important

39:03.540 --> 39:08.990
now, like, we're about to go
into battle.

39:08.990 --> 39:11.990
>> We have a backdoor plan right
now to get Jace out of the house

39:11.990 --> 39:14.990
but I'm starting to vsecond
thoughts about Audrey.

39:14.990 --> 39:19.990
I think Audrey's going to be on
the chopping block if she's not

39:19.990 --> 39:20.990
careful.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.990
>> I know Steve's going to use
the veto on himself.

39:55.990 --> 39:56.990
This is week one.

39:56.990 --> 39:57.990
It's a big decision.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.990
But at the end of the day, I
want to do what's best for my

39:59.990 --> 40:04.990
game.

40:04.990 --> 40:08.000
>> All week long, we've been
working on James to back door

40:08.000 --> 40:08.830
Jace.

40:08.830 --> 40:14.700
I really, really hope that James
keeps his word.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.990
>> I am in a good position right
now because I have an alliance

40:17.990 --> 40:18.700
with James.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.830
However, everybody knows you
should never feel too

40:20.830 --> 40:21.540
comfortable in this game.

40:21.540 --> 40:29.990
We shall see how this plays out.

40:29.990 --> 40:30.120
>> Hey, everyone.

40:30.120 --> 40:43.990
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:43.990 --> 40:46.990
This is the veto meeting.

40:46.990 --> 40:50.120
Jackie and myself have been
nominated for eviction.

40:50.120 --> 40:57.990
But I have the power to veto one
of those nominations.

40:57.990 --> 41:05.990
I have decided to use the power
of veto to save myself.

41:05.990 --> 41:08.990
James, you must now name a new
houseguest as a replacement

41:08.990 --> 41:16.950
nominee.

41:16.950 --> 41:18.990
>> I respect everybody as a game
player, but in the long run, I

41:18.990 --> 41:21.990
got to look out for my own game.

41:21.990 --> 41:26.990
So I came up with this decision
based on myself, and absolutely

41:26.990 --> 41:31.990
all myself.

41:31.990 --> 41:44.990
So with that being said, Jace,
sorry, man.

41:44.990 --> 41:47.990
>> The power of veto meet
something adjourned.

41:47.990 --> 41:55.990
-- Meeting is adjourned.

41:55.990 --> 41:58.830
>> Jace being blindsided means
I'm being blindsided and people

41:58.830 --> 41:58.990
are lying to me.

41:58.990 --> 42:03.990
And I got to figure out who's
playing whose puppet strings.

42:03.990 --> 42:07.990
>> I think unfortunately Jace is
his own worst enemy this this

42:07.990 --> 42:07.990
game.

42:07.990 --> 42:10.990
But I definitely need to make
sure that I keep in touch with

42:10.990 --> 42:14.120
everyone in the house to make
sure they don't flip on me.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.990
>> Jace is a strong competitor.

42:15.990 --> 42:17.990
I got to make sure that I look
out for my game in the long run.

42:17.990 --> 42:21.000
But at the end of the day, this
country buy's got to be on top.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.990
So, Jace, you got to go.

42:23.990 --> 42:29.990
>> I'm just thinking everything
has gone according to plan.

42:29.990 --> 42:32.990
>> I thought I was in an
alliance with James, but he made

42:32.990 --> 42:41.410
a commitment to me and he broke
it.

42:41.410 --> 42:44.290
>> Announcer: Who will be
evicted from the "big brother"

42:44.290 --> 42:44.990
house?

42:44.990 --> 42:45.990
Jackie or Jace?

42:45.990 --> 42:50.830
And the power is up for grabs in
a battle for head of household.

42:50.830 --> 42:53.410
Plus -- find out which
houseguests have been secretly

42:53.410 --> 42:55.990
playing with a twin.

42:55.990 --> 43:00.990
And the bb takeover continues
when Kathy Griffin flips up the

43:00.990 --> 43:00.990
game.

43:00.990 --> 43:05.700
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00/8:00 central on "big

43:05.700 --> 43:08.290
brother"!
