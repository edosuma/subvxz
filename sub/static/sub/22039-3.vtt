WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.301
Car 72, no activity.

00:08.424 --> 00:10.104
Can't believe you
didn't get me anything.

00:10.105 --> 00:11.905
I offered you these.

00:11.906 --> 00:13.746
I told you I don't eat that shit.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.627
I don't eat that low-grade
petrol station shit.

00:15.628 --> 00:19.069
It's not shit. The guy, he told
me his brother brings them in.

00:19.070 --> 00:20.910
They're, like, pork
and fennel or something.

00:20.911 --> 00:23.152
He's a farmer. He brings them
in every day, they're fresh.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.274
They're really good.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.636
- All right, gimme one.
- Mmm.

00:38.322 --> 00:39.802
That's fucking horrible!

00:39.803 --> 00:41.723
Gotcha!

00:41.724 --> 00:43.324
They're shit.

00:43.325 --> 00:44.805
- You're a dickhead.
- Yeah.

00:44.806 --> 00:46.606
Why would you do that?

00:46.607 --> 00:49.367
Mate, lips and arseholes are
gourmet compared to that shit.

00:49.368 --> 00:51.168
Oh, fuck off.

00:51.169 --> 00:53.450
Imagine the worst parts of the
animal just mixed in together.

00:53.451 --> 00:55.011
That's inside you now.

00:56.613 --> 00:58.333
Yeah.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.895
You're...

01:33.315 --> 01:34.875
Operation Big Red,

01:34.876 --> 01:36.636
continuing surveillance at the docks.

01:36.637 --> 01:38.517
We've got two known associates

01:38.518 --> 01:40.558
holed up at the shipping container.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.839
Car 72, continuing surveillance.

01:49.444 --> 01:52.965
Eh? Do you like it?

01:52.966 --> 01:54.927
Just stop it, mate.

01:54.928 --> 01:56.648
The middle woman.

01:56.649 --> 01:58.730
- Fuckin' stop it!
- I won't stop it! It's good!

01:59.528 --> 02:03.011
Yeah! Up and down... and up.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.852
How good are drones?!

02:07.853 --> 02:09.613
Basically, you can
do anything with them.

02:09.614 --> 02:11.495
It's the future, mate.
The future is a drone.

02:11.496 --> 02:13.536
You're taking out civilians.
Pew-pew-pew-pew!

02:13.537 --> 02:15.337
It's like computer games.

02:15.338 --> 02:17.178
Just sit on your couch
and bloody take over

02:17.179 --> 02:19.059
a bloody nation of innocents.

02:19.060 --> 02:21.020
Yeah? You don't like a drone?

02:21.021 --> 02:22.581
What does a drone actually do

02:22.582 --> 02:24.382
besides being a miniature helicopter?

02:24.383 --> 02:25.983
Exactly, that's it!
Imagine having a bloody miniature...

02:25.984 --> 02:27.544
That's the point!

02:27.545 --> 02:29.505
It's a miniature
helicopter at your disposal

02:29.506 --> 02:31.587
to do whatever you want with, you idiot!

02:31.588 --> 02:33.388
- So what?
- Who wouldn't want one?!

02:33.389 --> 02:35.269
- You wouldn't want that?
- What can they do?

02:35.270 --> 02:37.230
They can spy.

02:37.231 --> 02:39.111
You know you've got, like,
a bloody hot neighbour?

02:39.112 --> 02:40.752
Just over the fence, have a look.

02:40.753 --> 02:42.233
Hello, having a sunbake. Uh-oh.

02:42.234 --> 02:44.354
You get it back on your phone.

02:44.355 --> 02:45.955
A little message. Beep-beep!

02:45.956 --> 02:47.596
And you check out her beep-beeps.

02:47.597 --> 02:50.038
You don't see the future, do you?
You don't see.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.319
This is like a bloody
crystal ball in front of me.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.281
I don't understand how you can't
realise the potential of this.

02:55.282 --> 02:56.922
- Shut up!
- I will not shut up!

02:56.923 --> 02:59.403
Shut up! Shut up!

03:00.396 --> 03:01.486
Fine, then.

03:01.486 --> 03:05.247
You're not in on the deal.
I was gonna let you in early, but...

03:08.490 --> 03:10.250
It's the future, fuckface!

03:10.251 --> 03:11.732
Get the... Hey!

03:15.174 --> 03:17.014
Car 72, please report.

03:17.015 --> 03:19.055
Car 72, please report.

03:19.056 --> 03:21.176
Car 72. No activity, April.

03:21.177 --> 03:23.578
- Great, thanks.
- You okay then?

03:23.579 --> 03:26.048
- Yep. Yep, fine.
- Oh, that's good.

03:28.009 --> 03:29.383
Uh, yep.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.223
Sounded a bit awkward.

03:32.224 --> 03:34.424
- Yeah, is a bit.
- How was the date?

03:34.425 --> 03:36.225
I thought you said the date went well.

03:36.226 --> 03:39.267
The date went awesomely.
But she's blocking me.

03:39.268 --> 03:41.549
I'm texting, I'm texting, I'm calling.

03:41.550 --> 03:44.270
Nothing on the radio.
Like, she's an ice queen on the radio.

03:44.271 --> 03:46.071
I don't know what happened.

03:46.072 --> 03:49.073
It was, like, in the top
two best dates of my life.

03:49.074 --> 03:51.194
Maybe number one.
It was maybe number one.

03:51.195 --> 03:52.995
He's constantly calling.

03:52.996 --> 03:55.117
I would have thought
he'd be too embarrassed.

03:55.118 --> 03:56.958
Like, why would he
wanna relive any of it?

03:56.959 --> 03:59.279
Like, let's pretend it didn't happen.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.360
So I take her to
an old-school classy restaurant.

04:01.361 --> 04:04.202
- I take her to Werriston's.
- Ahh. Lovely.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.163
Yeah. You know, not
flashy. Not 'fusion'.

04:06.164 --> 04:09.726
I'm a full gentleman. I
take her chair out, you know.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.287
I do the full thing, you know,
"You look lovely tonight."

04:12.288 --> 04:14.568
- With the little bow like that?
- With the little bow.

04:14.569 --> 04:18.130
It was like being on a date with my dad.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.372
But, like, not even my dad.
Like, mygrandad.

04:21.373 --> 04:23.053
- Do you know him very well?
- Not really.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.855
He was really...

04:24.856 --> 04:28.217
I guess it's gentlemanly,
but it was a bit weird.

04:28.218 --> 04:30.138
Like, it was, like...

04:30.139 --> 04:32.419
"These are the things you do on a date."

04:32.420 --> 04:35.021
This couple a couple of
tables away have a proposal.

04:35.022 --> 04:36.822
- Oh!
- Lovely.

04:36.823 --> 04:38.663
- That doesn't happen every day!
- Not every day.

04:38.664 --> 04:40.384
And the whole restaurant's
like, "Aww. Lovely."

04:40.385 --> 04:42.465
I just got really
drunk to get through it.

04:42.466 --> 04:46.708
And then the couple next to
us gets engaged. Whoop-de-do!

04:46.709 --> 04:49.950
So I go, "Oh, look at
those young lovers."

04:49.951 --> 04:53.031
And I think of a really painful
memory to bring up emotion.

04:53.032 --> 04:55.193
I was thinking about when I was 13,

04:55.194 --> 04:57.594
I was down at the yabby
hole and caught the...

04:57.595 --> 04:59.275
Yeah, no, the fish hook in the nuts.

04:59.276 --> 05:00.876
Yeah. And I get tears in my eyes,

05:00.877 --> 05:03.037
I always do when I think of it too much,

05:03.038 --> 05:05.439
and, like, a little spillover,
a little tear down the cheek.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.240
- Open the floodgates!
- She doesn't know what I'm thinking.

05:07.241 --> 05:08.841
But it looks like
I'm thinking about them.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.683
And he starts crying.

05:11.684 --> 05:15.645
- What?!
- It didn't seem... genuine, either.

05:15.646 --> 05:17.846
It was kind of big, ugly crying.

05:17.847 --> 05:19.687
And then to top that, I go,

05:19.688 --> 05:22.169
"Garรงon, a bottle of your
finest fizz for the happy couple."

05:22.170 --> 05:24.290
- Generous. I can give.
- Yes.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.291
And then at the end,
he doesn't offer to pay,

05:26.292 --> 05:28.092
and so we go Dutchies.

05:28.093 --> 05:30.454
And I've paid for half
of a bottle of champagne

05:30.455 --> 05:32.215
for people I don't even care about.

05:32.216 --> 05:34.656
We live in totally different
directions, but I insist.

05:34.657 --> 05:37.218
- "Let's get a cab together."
- Oh, how gallant.

05:37.219 --> 05:38.659
Yeah. Get back to her place.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.140
- I'm tanked.
- Mmm.

05:40.141 --> 05:41.821
He said, "I'll walk you in."

05:41.822 --> 05:44.142
I went, "That'd be nice,
but do go off home."

05:44.143 --> 05:45.564
"I'm pretty tired."

05:45.604 --> 05:48.125
I'm walking up. Turn around,
he's paid, cab's gone.

05:48.126 --> 05:51.086
So we get into my place
and I'm, like, suddenly...

05:51.087 --> 05:53.968
Something hits me.
I gotta bolt to the bathroom.

05:53.969 --> 05:56.490
And I am violently ill, like, both...

05:56.491 --> 05:58.691
Like, violently ill
for about 15 minutes.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.692
And I swear he could hear it.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.773
- She's in there for, like, 15 minutes.
- Hoo!

06:02.774 --> 06:04.975
Must be doing all the
bits and pieces, you know?

06:04.976 --> 06:06.776
And I think, "Well,
she's making an effort."

06:06.777 --> 06:08.777
"I should make an effort too."

06:08.778 --> 06:11.139
So I take off my shoes,
take off my jacket,

06:11.140 --> 06:14.501
you know, just loosen my belt
a little bit, sit on the bed.

06:14.502 --> 06:18.103
So she comes out, right.
Joins me on the king-size single.

06:18.104 --> 06:21.985
And we start making out.
And it's super passionate.

06:21.986 --> 06:23.826
We're like... teenage kids.

06:23.827 --> 06:27.508
It's really... you know,
just passionate and full of energy.

06:27.509 --> 06:29.630
It was like a German shepherd.

06:29.631 --> 06:31.991
His, like, tongue is
on my eye, in my ear.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.032
- Ohh!
- Just all over.

06:34.033 --> 06:36.514
I mean, I haven't
brushed my teeth, Carol.

06:36.515 --> 06:38.875
And I think, "Let's
take this up a notch."

06:38.876 --> 06:41.237
And I brought out the big guns.

06:41.238 --> 06:43.398
You know I used to play the clarinet.

06:43.399 --> 06:44.679
- Yeah.
- For years.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.800
And still do occasionally.

06:46.801 --> 06:48.321
I've heard you, yeah.
The Christmas parties.

06:48.322 --> 06:49.922
Yeah, yeah, so you know I'm pretty good

06:49.923 --> 06:51.843
with the puh-puh-puh...

06:51.844 --> 06:54.244
With the tonguing and the...
Right? So I go downtown.

06:54.245 --> 06:56.406
'Cause I'm, like, "Let's
show this lady a good time."

06:56.407 --> 06:58.207
I don't know, he's, um,

06:58.208 --> 07:00.808
talking some shit about
used to play the tuba,

07:00.809 --> 07:02.569
and so it's his thing.

07:02.570 --> 07:05.251
I, um, think I nodded off for a bit.

07:05.252 --> 07:09.213
And then I, um, just pretended
to enjoy it and went to sleep.

07:09.214 --> 07:11.215
Finished with a climax.

07:11.216 --> 07:13.616
She's kinda sleepy,
relaxed, blissed out.

07:13.617 --> 07:15.497
I'm, like, I don't ask
for anything in return.

07:15.498 --> 07:17.298
- I'm all about giving.
- Nice.

07:17.299 --> 07:19.540
Leave her there, like,
smooth over the bed.

07:19.541 --> 07:21.461
I kiss her, just peck on the forehead.

07:21.462 --> 07:23.582
"Goodnight, sweet lady."

07:23.583 --> 07:25.383
- Wow!
- Yeah.

07:25.384 --> 07:28.145
You just kicked that out of the park.

07:28.146 --> 07:30.586
- I think so.
- I wish I could have half of that skill.

07:30.587 --> 07:33.268
I'd say it was the worst
date ever, actually.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.749
Bottom, bottom.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.711
If you could teach me
a bit of that clarinet thing,

07:38.712 --> 07:42.033
I could take that home to
Wendy and just... just win her.

07:42.034 --> 07:44.795
Could we not talk about you
impregnating your sad wife?

07:44.796 --> 07:47.076
Do we have to? Can I just have this?

07:47.077 --> 07:50.839
Can we just leave this with me for now?

07:58.804 --> 08:01.044
No sign of suspicious
persons at this time.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.446
There's thousands of
shipping containers down here.

08:03.447 --> 08:05.127
We've just gotta wait 'em out.

08:05.969 --> 08:07.089
Who's that?

08:08.826 --> 08:10.610
- Who is that?
- Doesn't matter.

08:11.342 --> 08:13.012
- Got a girlfriend?
- No.

08:13.013 --> 08:15.333
- Who is she?
- Shut up.

08:15.334 --> 08:17.134
You got a picture? Show us a picture!

08:17.135 --> 08:19.095
I don't need to show you a picture.

08:19.096 --> 08:21.537
- Got any nude pictures?
- No, I've not got nude pictures.

08:21.538 --> 08:23.539
- Show us the nude pictures...
- Hey!

08:25.780 --> 08:27.261
She, uh...

08:28.862 --> 08:30.822
She calls me 'Mr Positions'.

08:35.946 --> 08:37.426
Why?

08:37.427 --> 08:38.986
'Cause of all the manoeuvres I do.

08:38.988 --> 08:40.788
Oh, yeah? Mr Kama Sutra, eh?

08:40.789 --> 08:43.350
I can do all the bloody...
I can do all the styles.

08:43.351 --> 08:44.831
Oh, yeah. What's your favourite?

08:44.832 --> 08:46.552
- Freelance.
- Oh, right.

08:46.553 --> 08:49.794
Just, like, any... any
position she wants me in,

08:49.795 --> 08:51.595
I can bend to it.

08:51.596 --> 08:53.196
There's only one or
two exceptions to that.

08:53.197 --> 08:54.837
The ploughman's lunch?

08:54.838 --> 08:56.438
I've never got into that one.

08:56.439 --> 08:58.519
Never been a fan of a pickle.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.680
- Splitting the bamboo?
- What?

09:00.681 --> 09:03.682
- Crying monkey?
- Really? Is that a real one?

09:03.683 --> 09:06.444
- The whispering frog?
- How does a frog whisper?

09:06.445 --> 09:08.285
- They don't even have lips.
- Yeah, they do.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.327
- Of course they've got lips.
- How do they whisper?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.850
That is some hot stuff.

09:17.851 --> 09:20.492
You ever done the... the blind man?

09:20.493 --> 09:22.533
What's that?
You just turn out the lights?

09:23.058 --> 09:24.214
Yes.

09:24.677 --> 09:26.336
It's just in-the-dark style.

09:26.337 --> 09:29.938
The crouching tiger.
The beamer. The mini minor.

09:29.939 --> 09:31.739
Oh, I don't even know these things.

09:31.740 --> 09:34.460
- I feel like an idiot.
- It's just young love.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.662
We did the lamb cuntlet.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.663
- The what?
- The lamb cuntlet.

09:38.664 --> 09:40.704
Don't you mean 'cutlet'?

09:42.055 --> 09:42.986
Cutlet?

09:42.987 --> 09:44.947
Cuntlet. What are you saying?

09:44.948 --> 09:46.668
I said 'lamb cutlet'.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.509
Isn't a cutlet, like, a pirate thing?

09:48.510 --> 09:50.110
Like, "Arggh, here's me cutlet"?

09:50.111 --> 09:52.431
No, a cutlet's a type of lamb chop.

09:52.432 --> 09:56.714
They cut down a full rack
of ribs and they create

09:56.715 --> 09:59.155
the little individual
kind of meat lollipops.

09:59.156 --> 10:01.957
I've been having cuntlets
at my nan's house for years.

10:02.991 --> 10:04.438
We say 'cuntlet'.

10:04.439 --> 10:06.401
She a bit deaf?

10:09.883 --> 10:11.843
It's all right.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.885
- You're nice, man.
- Oh...

10:14.886 --> 10:17.526
Everyone's always like,
"Oh, you're the best, Glen."

10:17.527 --> 10:22.249
You're not. You're kinda...
You're honest with me, you know?

10:22.250 --> 10:25.851
You'll call a cuntlet
a cutlet and I like that.

10:25.852 --> 10:28.173
- It's all right, mate.
- Stop it.

10:28.174 --> 10:29.655
- Nah, it's all right.
- Stop it!

10:34.577 --> 10:36.137
You guys there? Come in.

10:36.868 --> 10:38.299
Yes. Jacob?

10:38.300 --> 10:40.940
- Hi, it's Jacob from Port...
- Yes, Jacob from Port Security.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.421
I know who it is.

10:42.422 --> 10:45.863
I've come across a bag of white powder.

10:45.864 --> 10:48.145
About 350g.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.266
Where did you find it?

10:50.267 --> 10:53.428
Out... Not in here. Outside the office.

10:54.464 --> 10:56.590
You should probably
come and check it out.

10:56.591 --> 10:58.831
You might be able to
shed a little light on it.

11:01.153 --> 11:02.633
Oh, for fuck's sake.

11:02.634 --> 11:04.514
Yep, okay. Just wait there, Jacob.

11:05.036 --> 11:06.717
I'll come down shortly.

11:14.321 --> 11:15.322
Fuckhead!

11:15.323 --> 11:18.123
Ah! Fuckin' hell. Jesus Christ.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.365
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:22.686 --> 11:25.647
Because you're his father.

11:27.289 --> 11:29.609
Thanks for nothing.

11:29.610 --> 11:31.210
How'd you go?

11:31.211 --> 11:33.012
- No good.
- No good. Nuh.

11:33.013 --> 11:37.134
Refuses to take any
responsibility for his own son.

11:37.135 --> 11:38.735
That's a shame, Carol.

11:38.736 --> 11:41.737
Refuses to help me out when I need him.

11:41.738 --> 11:43.538
You know, Lachy's been suspended.

11:43.539 --> 11:46.419
I can't have him being home
by himself the whole time.

11:47.661 --> 11:49.581
He's been suspended for a week.

11:49.582 --> 11:52.223
- For... a week?
- Yeah.

11:52.224 --> 11:53.784
So, there...

11:53.785 --> 11:55.260
There was a bubbler.

11:55.284 --> 11:58.245
And he's... mounted the bubbler.

11:58.246 --> 12:00.086
Ah, right. Okay.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.408
- For his own pleasure.
- Got that, yeah.

12:03.409 --> 12:06.770
I mean, I just...
They're making a very big thing of it.

12:06.771 --> 12:09.612
They've bloody cordoned
the whole area off.

12:09.613 --> 12:11.653
- They've taped it up, you know?
- Oh, poor Lachy.

12:11.654 --> 12:14.014
- That's a bit much.
- I know. Overreaction.

12:14.015 --> 12:15.855
I've just walked straight
over to the bubbler

12:15.856 --> 12:18.097
and I have drunk out of it

12:18.098 --> 12:20.378
just to show everyone, there's
nothing wrong with the bubbler.

12:20.379 --> 12:24.901
Treating it like he's damaged
school property.

12:25.890 --> 12:27.383
Anyway, I'm just...

12:27.383 --> 12:31.345
You know, and everyone
knows. All the kids know.

12:31.346 --> 12:34.747
And they're...
You know, kids can be cruel too.

12:34.748 --> 12:36.948
They can be. Oh, poor Lachy.

12:36.949 --> 12:39.550
I know. Calling him names and stuff.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.471
Aquanuts.

12:41.472 --> 12:43.592
Bubble Boy.

12:44.092 --> 12:46.053
H2Orgasm.

12:47.385 --> 12:48.595
Fountain Fucker.

12:50.717 --> 12:54.158
Oh, that... That is really hurtful.

12:54.159 --> 12:55.879
- To Lachy.
- I'm so sorry.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.721
I'm glad it's a source
of amusement for you.

12:57.722 --> 12:59.201
It's not funny. I'm sorry, Carol.

12:59.202 --> 13:00.763
- That's...
- Juvenile.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.061
Sorry, Carol.

13:14.213 --> 13:15.694
Jacob.

13:17.332 --> 13:19.132
Holy shit.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.333
You're better-looking than I thought.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.655
Thank you. You had some white powder?

13:23.656 --> 13:26.176
- Yes, I did.
- Okay.

13:26.177 --> 13:28.698
Little bit of white powder.

13:28.699 --> 13:30.899
Couple of eggs.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.540
Cup of sugar.

13:32.541 --> 13:34.382
And...

13:40.826 --> 13:42.826
It's a cake.

13:42.827 --> 13:46.228
It's a cake that says "Welcome Hendy"
and that said 'Stokes'

13:46.229 --> 13:49.110
but the air conditioning's
broken so it's melted.

13:49.111 --> 13:51.351
So you brought me down here
because you made a cake.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.831
No.

13:54.086 --> 13:55.714
My mum made a cake.

13:55.715 --> 13:58.356
I think I told you to tell
nobody that we were here.

13:58.357 --> 13:59.957
I didn't tell anyone that you were here.

13:59.958 --> 14:01.312
Who made the cake?

14:03.720 --> 14:05.200
My mum.

14:05.201 --> 14:06.881
Your mum made the cake.

14:06.882 --> 14:08.522
So you told your mum on the phone

14:08.523 --> 14:10.603
we were here at the docks
on an undercover operation

14:10.604 --> 14:12.244
when I specifically told you

14:12.245 --> 14:14.045
not to tell anybody that we were here.

14:14.046 --> 14:16.355
- It's just my mum.
- Bit annoyed.

14:16.395 --> 14:18.289
It's not appropriate.
The cake's not appropriate.

14:18.314 --> 14:20.379
- It's just a cake, mate.
- Don't call again.

14:22.879 --> 14:25.093
I'll take the cake because it's here.

14:25.815 --> 14:27.136
Welcome.

14:27.161 --> 14:29.201
- Thank you.
- It's a pleasure.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.842
It's not appropriate, but thank you.

14:30.843 --> 14:32.323
Wasn't so hard, though, was it?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.921
Okay.

14:39.124 --> 14:41.152
Yep. Yeah, they loved it.

14:46.009 --> 14:47.849
This is shit, isn't it?

14:47.850 --> 14:49.350
It's all right.

14:49.438 --> 14:51.519
- You know where I wish I was?
- Where?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.760
- The States.
- Oh, yeah?

14:53.761 --> 14:55.894
This country...
this country's gone to shit.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.242
Why?

14:57.243 --> 14:59.603
It's just negative
vibes everywhere you go.

14:59.604 --> 15:01.805
I just don't feel supported
here as a criminal.

15:01.806 --> 15:04.126
Here, you're taught to dream small.

15:04.127 --> 15:07.448
I wanna dream big. I wanna go
over there and blow shit up.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.009
You know when you just wanna bloody...

15:09.010 --> 15:10.530
pull out a bloody Phillips head

15:10.531 --> 15:12.411
and fuckin' stab 'em
in the fuckin' head!

15:12.412 --> 15:13.991
- Yeah.
- You do, don't ya?

15:14.016 --> 15:17.574
Yeah. And...
and you mention that around here

15:17.575 --> 15:19.816
and half the time people just
wanna piss on your dreams.

15:19.817 --> 15:23.178
But they freak out.
"Ooh, no! Bloody don't do that!"

15:23.179 --> 15:25.699
It's pretty true. It's pretty
kinda small-scale, isn't it?

15:25.700 --> 15:27.340
Just the whole vibe over
there's just supportive.

15:27.341 --> 15:29.141
It's just one of...

15:29.142 --> 15:32.263
I know this is gonna sound
weird, but it's... it's love.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.705
- They just support your ideas.
- How do you mean?

15:34.706 --> 15:36.185
Okay, so, like...

15:36.186 --> 15:38.187
I pitched at a meeting.

15:38.188 --> 15:41.221
A few months ago, I was gonna
go bloody blow up a casino.

15:41.246 --> 15:42.998
Over here, okay.

15:43.023 --> 15:45.351
All those naysayers are,
like, "No, you can't do that."

15:45.352 --> 15:47.152
"Don't bloody blow up a casino."

15:47.153 --> 15:49.233
- Tall poppy syndrome.
- Yeah, totally!

15:49.234 --> 15:51.355
Over there, they're
just, like, "Go for it!"

15:51.356 --> 15:53.836
"You blow up that fucking casino."

15:53.837 --> 15:55.877
"You get in there,
you blow that fucker sky-high."

15:55.878 --> 15:57.358
Follow your dreams.

15:57.359 --> 15:58.774
You don't have your
dreams, what have you got?

15:58.799 --> 15:59.599
Nothin'!

15:59.600 --> 16:00.920
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

16:00.921 --> 16:02.361
You're a little sweetheart, aren't ya?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.242
- I've never been there.
- What?

16:04.243 --> 16:05.723
Never been to the States.

16:05.724 --> 16:07.779
Sorry, you've never been to the States?

16:07.811 --> 16:09.559
- No.
- You've gotta go, mate.

16:09.584 --> 16:11.480
Hey. Stop.

16:12.373 --> 16:14.333
I'm gonna take you there right now.

16:14.334 --> 16:16.295
- What do you mean?
- Close your bloody eyes.

16:16.296 --> 16:17.976
- Close 'em.
- What?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.457
Close your eyes.

16:20.867 --> 16:21.913
Open your mouth.

16:21.938 --> 16:24.081
- What?
- Just open your mouth. It's good.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.300
I don't want to.

16:25.301 --> 16:27.022
Come on. Come on, you'll like it.

16:29.143 --> 16:31.145
Welcome to America.

16:39.069 --> 16:41.710
- That was just a taste.
- Wow!

16:41.711 --> 16:44.872
Still no sign of
shipments or suspects.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.835
We sure we got the right dockyard?

16:49.075 --> 16:51.316
Oops.

16:51.317 --> 16:54.434
Ah! Oh, no.

16:54.585 --> 16:55.758
Hmm?

16:55.759 --> 16:58.920
Can you, um... Oh, what's that?

16:58.921 --> 17:01.001
- Look out there for a second.
- Why?

17:01.002 --> 17:03.674
Just... just give me
some privacy, will you?

17:03.699 --> 17:04.698
Why?

17:04.723 --> 17:07.242
Put the binoculars on
and look out the window.

17:07.268 --> 17:08.243
Why?

17:08.269 --> 17:11.310
Because you're my friend
and I'm asking you.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.086
What's happening?

17:21.367 --> 17:23.489
- Oh, Jesus, Stokes!
- It's all right.

17:23.490 --> 17:26.290
- What is happening?
- I'm just taking a photo.

17:26.290 --> 17:28.492
All right? For Pam.

17:29.070 --> 17:31.149
- Are you having an affair?
- No!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.974
No way.

17:32.975 --> 17:37.497
I just met this... this
lady at the airport.

17:37.498 --> 17:41.259
We got our bags mixed up on the
carriage. On the carousel thing.

17:41.260 --> 17:44.381
We both went to grab the
same bag and hit heads.

17:44.382 --> 17:46.182
We had a laugh.

17:46.183 --> 17:49.011
And then we went back out,
we were at the taxi rank,

17:49.036 --> 17:51.986
and I was looking around and I shuffled

17:51.987 --> 17:53.667
and we hit heads a second time!

17:53.668 --> 17:56.148
- Mm-hm.
- So we laughed again.

17:56.149 --> 17:59.911
And anyway, she went to get in
a taxi and she stopped, right?

17:59.912 --> 18:04.113
She turns around and she had
the courage to walk up to me

18:04.114 --> 18:05.914
and give me her card.

18:05.915 --> 18:09.156
At which point, you said,
"I'm sorry. I'm married."

18:09.157 --> 18:11.277
- Well, no.
- No?

18:11.278 --> 18:14.800
I just thought... how brave she was.

18:14.801 --> 18:17.259
I mean, that...
that showed real courage.

18:17.284 --> 18:22.844
And I... You know, I just think
that that should be rewarded.

18:22.845 --> 18:24.325
So now you're sending her dick pics.

18:24.326 --> 18:26.286
Well... yes.

18:26.287 --> 18:27.966
It's what she asked for.

18:27.991 --> 18:30.529
But, you know, there's
nothing sexual in it.

18:30.530 --> 18:33.771
Isn't it? I'm sorry, I thought
dick pics were pretty sexual.

18:33.772 --> 18:36.452
No! She's... Pam's 65.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.294
65?!

18:38.295 --> 18:41.015
All right, well, maybe for
her there is something sexual,

18:41.016 --> 18:43.056
but for me, I'm just
rewarding her bravery.

18:43.057 --> 18:44.898
And you get to send your dick to people

18:44.899 --> 18:46.659
and not go to prison for it.

18:46.660 --> 18:50.661
I just wanna live in a world
where that kind of... bravery

18:50.662 --> 18:53.263
and beauty is rewarded.

18:53.264 --> 18:56.785
We shut each other
down too much, you know?

18:56.786 --> 18:59.346
She took a chance,
she put herself out there.

18:59.347 --> 19:03.669
She was brave and I
think that was beautiful.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.270
Oh, here we go.

19:05.271 --> 19:07.191
- Ohh!
- Oh, Jesus Chri...

19:07.192 --> 19:09.632
- Whoa!
- How did she get the...

19:09.633 --> 19:11.474
Oh, yeah, this has gotta stop.

19:15.477 --> 19:18.158
You know, I've gotta say,

19:18.159 --> 19:19.798
you know, the boss's nephew,

19:20.485 --> 19:21.984
a bit of a cock,

19:23.041 --> 19:24.881
throws his weight around a bit,

19:24.882 --> 19:26.442
misplaced sense of humour, perhaps,

19:26.443 --> 19:28.443
bit of a silly billy,

19:29.525 --> 19:30.924
big mouth,

19:30.925 --> 19:32.805
you know, all talk,

19:32.806 --> 19:34.567
dresses like a fool,

19:34.568 --> 19:36.408
bald prick,

19:36.409 --> 19:40.490
always getting his foot out
of his stupid... stupid mouth,

19:40.491 --> 19:42.251
dumb moustache,

19:42.252 --> 19:44.492
silly eyes.

19:44.493 --> 19:47.014
When you kinda peel all that back,

19:47.562 --> 19:49.043
you're actually...

19:50.217 --> 19:51.855
actually a pretty special bloke.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.500
I liked you immediately.

20:01.664 --> 20:03.385
Yeah, I'm almost gonna miss you when...

20:05.023 --> 20:06.502
when Bruce gets back.

20:07.197 --> 20:08.507
Are you joking?

20:09.070 --> 20:12.709
Yeah, when Bruce recovers
from the injuries.

20:12.710 --> 20:15.551
- He's not coming back, mate.
- What do you mean?

20:15.552 --> 20:17.993
Brucey's gone. He's bloody...

20:17.994 --> 20:19.473
He's brain dead.

20:19.474 --> 20:21.315
No, I heard he was shot in the leg.

20:21.316 --> 20:22.956
No, no, no, mate.

20:22.957 --> 20:24.597
And once he gets off the crutches...

20:24.598 --> 20:26.705
No, no, mate. He's gone!

20:26.730 --> 20:29.039
He's a full vegetable.
He's like a vegetable.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.401
He's got the mind of
a bloody wilted parsnip

20:32.402 --> 20:34.643
that's been sitting in the
bottom of the fridge too long.

20:34.644 --> 20:36.564
He's all bloody bendy. He can't...

20:36.565 --> 20:38.445
Like, sentence don't
come no good no more.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.246
- Course he can.
- Nah, mate, he's gone.

20:40.247 --> 20:42.807
His brain's gone to mush.
He's like overboiled broccoli.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.169
You know your nanna? Remember
your nanna would make broccoli?

20:45.170 --> 20:47.090
- Just boil it for years.
- Shut up.

20:47.091 --> 20:49.131
For years and years, then
pour it onto the plate.

20:49.132 --> 20:50.652
- Just shut up.
- It's lost its lustre.

20:50.653 --> 20:52.213
It's not even a vegetable anymore.

20:52.214 --> 20:53.694
It's nothing. He's nothing.
There's nothing left.

20:53.695 --> 20:55.175
Just shut up.

20:55.176 --> 20:57.583
He's like a Halloween
pumpkin left out in the rain.

20:57.608 --> 20:58.897
Shut up.

20:58.898 --> 21:00.698
The kids are around
going, "Give me lollies,"

21:00.699 --> 21:02.539
but there's nothing in there,
there's nothing at home.

21:02.540 --> 21:04.821
I mean, he's been
blanched into nothingness.

21:04.822 --> 21:07.182
He's mush, mate. He's a complete vegie.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.300
He's like flaccid celery.

21:09.325 --> 21:10.704
Shut up, Glen.

21:10.705 --> 21:12.505
There's nothing in
there, 'cause he's gone.

21:12.506 --> 21:14.987
- He's like that weird juice...
- Shut up.

21:14.988 --> 21:17.748
You know that stuff that you go,
"What the hell is that?!"

21:17.749 --> 21:19.589
- Shut up, Glen.
- He's got minutes to live, mate.

21:19.590 --> 21:21.792
He's gone. He's absolutely gone.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.780
Guys, are you there?

21:40.781 --> 21:43.321
Yes, Jacob. We've been
here all night. All night.

21:43.321 --> 21:45.818
Are you hearing that? It's like a...

21:46.525 --> 21:51.549
like a dull thudding sound.

21:54.912 --> 21:57.833
Like a bag of potatoes being pushed...

21:57.834 --> 22:00.874
slammed up against,
like, a metal surface.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.076
You know what? I think we do hear that.

22:03.077 --> 22:05.357
Um, okay. Well, listen.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.598
We're gonna go investigate that sound

22:07.599 --> 22:09.880
for possibly the next
two to three hours.

22:09.881 --> 22:11.721
We're gonna need you
to keep the airwaves

22:11.722 --> 22:13.522
completely silent while we do that.

22:13.523 --> 22:17.124
But good work, Jacob. Please
give yourself a pat on the back.

22:17.125 --> 22:19.245
- Yeah, all right, I will.
- Are you doing it now?

22:19.246 --> 22:22.607
- Yep.
- Say it.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.408
I'm giving myself a pat on the back.

22:25.099 --> 22:26.570
It's stopped.
