WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:04.796
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.880 --> 00:08.425
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.509 --> 00:11.720
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.803 --> 00:14.556
On which we used to rely?

00:14.640 --> 00:18.018
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:18.101 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.232
All the things
that make us

00:23.315 --> 00:24.691
Laugh and cry

00:24.775 --> 00:29.988
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:33.784 --> 00:35.661
MAN ON TV:
We now return to JAG.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.080
Harm, I found that
evidence we need.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.958
Now we can finally clear
that Chief Petty Officer of all charges.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.292
Oh, what's the point?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.585
Does anybody even
watch this show?

00:43.669 --> 00:45.587
Well, yeah, old people.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.506
I mean, they--they--they don't
really pay attention.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.258
They--they just like
the noise and the company.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.759
Hey, how you doing?

00:50.843 --> 00:52.845
How's that hip doing there?

00:53.637 --> 00:55.264
Remember the '40s?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.515
(doorbell rings)

00:59.518 --> 01:00.894
Hey, everybody.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.563
I'm just here to
let y'all know that

01:02.646 --> 01:05.107
movie night's been
moved to Joe's place.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.401
What? But we--we always
do it here.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.611
Movie night at
the Griffin house is a tradition.

01:09.695 --> 01:13.323
Yeah, but Joe just
finished putting in his new home theater.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.659
It's gonna be tight, y'all.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.123
Oh, my God,
Joe, how did you do this?

01:21.206 --> 01:24.459
I built it myself with supplies
I got at the Home Supply downtown.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.796
Hey, between you and me, I think Joe's got
a little free time these days.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.132
I hear he hasn't
touched Bonnie in months.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.176
Peter, you just
whispered that to me.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.468
Shh. Here he is.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.679
Joe, what a great job
you've done here.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.723
All right,
let's get this started.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.437
WOMAN: Thank you for choosing
Joe Swanson Theaters.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.334
Rocky, please don't go to Mars
and fight the Martian.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.085
I got to do
what I got to do.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.004
But there's no oxygen
on Mars.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.924
Yeah? That means
there's no oxygen for him, either.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.301
That Martian wants a fight,
he'll get a fight.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.638
You can't win, Rock!
You're 60 years old!

02:17.721 --> 02:20.098
Hey, look what Rocky
bought me with his money.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.395
Freaking Joe with
his home theater.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.064
Has to top everything I do.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.316
Well, tomorrow
I'm gonna go to that Home Supply

02:29.399 --> 02:31.401
and I'm gonna build
an entire multiplex.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.530
Well, let's just hope it looks better
than that balcony you built.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.366
Boy, that was a great episode
of Lost. Wasn't it, fellas?

02:37.449 --> 02:39.117
Well, at least the show's
got the right name.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.786
Yeah, I couldn't follow
any of it.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.538
(both laughing)

02:42.621 --> 02:44.831
(laughs) They don't care
for most things.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.965
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.049
Uh, I hate my neighbor,

02:54.132 --> 02:56.093
and I want to build something
crazy out of spite.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.262
Well, I'll take you
to our one-upsmanship aisle.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.347
Man,
this place has everything.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.516
I bet you can even get
one of those gay mailboxes.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.352
Hello, hello! Right here.
Yeah, just right here.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.562
Just go ahead and
put that right in here.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.313
Yeah. (imitates
eating noises) Gulp.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.398
(laughs) Just kidding.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.607
Uh, pardon me.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.401
I just bought
a rottweiler and I need

03:12.484 --> 03:14.570
a sign to warn people
how dangerous it is.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.071
Well, we have exactly what--

03:16.154 --> 03:18.824
Ah, yes,
here it is, "One way."

03:18.907 --> 03:21.577
So people will know
if they step into my yard,

03:21.660 --> 03:23.996
there's only one way out.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.207
In a body bag
from dog injuries.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.792
Good day, ma'am.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.421
This'll teach Joe to
steal my movie night.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.631
I'm gonna have my own
multiplex theater.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.426
I haven't been this excited
since I learned how to speak Braille.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.429
Hey,
bump, bump, no bump, bump,

03:40.512 --> 03:42.556
three vertical bumps,
four bumps and a square.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.724
(laughing)

03:43.807 --> 03:45.559
Yeah, I've heard
they all look alike.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.522
Hey, look what I found.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.941
Wow, authentic
Native American remains.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.610
Peter, I'd put that
back if I were you.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.612
You may be disturbing
a sacred burial site.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.238
Hey, look,
it's Robin Williams.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.406
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.657
Black preacher voice.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.076
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. Gay Elmer Fudd.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.745
(laughing)

04:04.828 --> 04:07.748
The more you hear it,
the funnier it gets.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.670
Want some more peas,
Chief Diamond Phillips?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.797
Peter, I really think you should
put that back where you found it.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.174
You know, Brian,
I really don't think

04:17.257 --> 04:18.425
you should
breast-feed the skull.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.510
Uh, I'm not
breast-feeding.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.886
All right, fine.
God, you're pushy.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.430
-Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.
-Oh. Hey, hey!

04:23.514 --> 04:25.390
-Oh, God, cut it out!
-So many nipples. Suck, suck, suck.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.017
-Knock it off!
-Oh, I'm Brian. I'm having sustenance.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.727
-What's wrong with you?
-Look at me, everybody.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.063
I'm breast-feeding in public
even though it's wrong.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.150
MAN ON TV: And now
back to 1943's...

04:37.277 --> 04:38.612
Well, isn't this
a fine song and dance?

04:38.695 --> 04:39.988
-What are you getting so hot about?
-Keep your shirt on.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.406
Where do you get off
making remarks like that?

04:41.490 --> 04:42.491
Supposing I say
you're a lunkhead?

04:42.574 --> 04:43.992
Well, I ain't much
for supposing.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.619
-Well, supposing you were?
-Well, maybe I'm through supposing

04:45.702 --> 04:46.995
-and I fix to start figuring.
-Ah, horseradish.

04:47.079 --> 04:48.664
Well, aren't you
a pocketful of firecrackers?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.040
Oh, yeah?
You got something to say about it?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.124
I'll say plenty.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.960
I can't wait to
see the expression

04:53.043 --> 04:55.045
on Joe's legs when
I open my multiplex.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.340
I have to say I'm a little concerned
about the zoning for--

04:58.423 --> 05:00.676
Peter, are you peeing
in that skull?

05:00.759 --> 05:02.511
No, Lois,
I'm getting up and walking

05:02.594 --> 05:05.180
all the way to the bathroom
and doing it there.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.682
Pain in the ass.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.645
(The Star-Spangled Banner
playing on TV)

05:24.700 --> 05:26.577
This concludes
our broadcast day.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.370
The only time of the day
I get to try out

05:28.453 --> 05:30.372
my Fred Schneider
B-52's voice.

05:30.455 --> 05:34.376
(mimicking Fred Schneider)
Now try to get some sleep out there.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.879
Not bad. Getting better.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.548
(static buzzing)

05:56.690 --> 05:57.733
Yeah.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.818
Uh-huh.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.070
I don't know.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.947
I don't know.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.824
Oh, you didn't see it?

06:05.908 --> 06:07.409
Uh, Ross and Rachel
got back together.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.744
It wasn't that great.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.663
(whispering voices)

06:27.679 --> 06:29.473
Holy crap!
What the hell was that?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.808
Stewie, what are you doing?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.936
They're here.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.020
Who's here?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.355
The TV people.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.899
What? No, they did a spin-off.

06:38.982 --> 06:43.028
Um, he's still playing Joey,
but, uh, it's not doing so well.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.626
Uh, Lois, have you noticed
some spooky things going on

06:57.709 --> 06:59.628
ever since Peter
brought that skull into the house?

06:59.711 --> 07:01.588
No.
What are you talking about?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.924
Well, like the whole
business last night with the TV.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.134
I'm just saying,
maybe we have a poltergeist.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.096
Brian, there's no
such thing as ghosts. It's all just--

07:09.179 --> 07:10.848
(gasping)

07:10.931 --> 07:14.184
Oh, I must have accidentally stacked
all those things upside down

07:14.268 --> 07:15.811
and then just forgot about it.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.646
Yeah, that's probably
what happened.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.523
Huh. I haven't seen
this much denial

07:19.606 --> 07:21.817
since John Travolta
married Kelly Preston.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.902
John, do you take Kelly
to be your wife?

07:23.986 --> 07:27.197
I totally do. I mean,
yeah, yes. Absolutely.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.659
And I-I'm going to do
stuff to her, too, like, touch her.

07:30.742 --> 07:34.162
Yeah, touch her
and, uh, kiss her

07:34.246 --> 07:35.622
and touch her penis.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.833
I mean, no, not that.
Not that.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.339
Okay, okay, try to think
of a happy place to be.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.674
Happy place. Uh...

07:45.757 --> 07:48.635
Okay, okay,
I'm on MTV's Jackass.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.220
Hey, I'm Stewie Griffin,

07:50.304 --> 07:53.599
and I'm going to be kicking
my dad's ass all day today.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.102
(groaning)

07:57.186 --> 08:00.355
What the hell?
Stewie, stop, stop!

08:00.439 --> 08:03.192
Ah! Knock it off!
Knock it--Ah! Ah!

08:03.275 --> 08:05.152
Come on!

08:05.235 --> 08:07.446
Come on, Stewie.

08:07.529 --> 08:10.657
You're acting
crazy out there, man.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.783
(sighing)

08:12.993 --> 08:13.994
(screaming)

08:14.995 --> 08:16.246
No!

08:16.330 --> 08:21.168
I haven't seen anything suck this much
since I Heart Huckabees.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.480
(laughing)

08:41.563 --> 08:42.814
Propane.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.025
I wish that
scary-looking clown

08:45.108 --> 08:47.486
at the end of my bed
would go away.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.698
(screaming)

08:57.412 --> 09:01.583
Hey, skinny britches.
That there is my man.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.670
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

09:07.714 --> 09:10.384
You shall not pass.

09:41.248 --> 09:45.252
Stewie? Oh, my God, Stewie,
honey, where are you?

09:45.335 --> 09:46.962
Peter,
I can't find him anywhere.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.505
STEWIE: (distorted) Mommy?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.966
(gasps) Stewie?
Where are you?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.843
STEWIE:
Look behind you, you stupid cow!

09:52.926 --> 09:54.219
Stewie?

09:54.303 --> 09:56.555
Oh, my God!
What's happening?

09:56.638 --> 09:59.099
Oh, wait, hold on a second.
I want to try something.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.852
I remember

10:01.935 --> 10:05.564
I remember the worry,
worry

10:05.647 --> 10:08.233
How could I ever forget

10:08.317 --> 10:10.611
The hurt doesn't show

10:10.694 --> 10:13.655
But the pain still grows

10:13.739 --> 10:16.742
No stranger to you and me

10:16.825 --> 10:18.744
(imitating drums)

10:22.748 --> 10:24.082
Thank you for coming.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.084
We've never hired
a spiritual medium before,

10:26.168 --> 10:28.420
but I'll do anything
to get my baby back.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.547
You know, Peter, we wouldn't have
to be messing around with ghosts

10:30.631 --> 10:32.883
if you hadn't desecrated
those Indian remains.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.301
Probably a bad time
to mention

10:34.384 --> 10:36.261
I'm wearing the skull
as an athletic cup.

10:36.345 --> 10:39.097
Okay,
let's talk to some spirits.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.517
Hey, how y'all ghosts doing?

10:41.600 --> 10:44.436
Y'all got a little friend of ours
named Stewart up there.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.606
We was just wondering
if you could send him back.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.107
Uh-huh.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.901
Well, yes, but I...

10:50.984 --> 10:54.321
Well, I don't see how
that's anybody's business but my own.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.989
Well,
how about you and my father

10:56.073 --> 10:57.866
go and hang out
at the gun range

10:57.950 --> 10:59.326
some afternoon
and you can spend

10:59.409 --> 11:01.495
the whole day just
agreeing with each other.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.830
What are they saying?
Is my baby all right?

11:03.914 --> 11:05.791
They said that
your baby had entered

11:05.874 --> 11:07.793
their world through
the closet upstairs,

11:07.876 --> 11:11.129
and that the exit is...
Well, I don't know how else to say this,

11:11.213 --> 11:13.507
but the exit is
your daughter's bum.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.175
Meg's ass!

11:18.804 --> 11:20.472
You ready down there?

11:20.556 --> 11:21.682
Okay, Meg,
if this works,

11:21.765 --> 11:24.059
then we might
just have a chance at getting Stewie back.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.352
-Are you ready?
-No.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.478
Ready!

11:26.562 --> 11:27.604
Okay, here we go.

11:29.898 --> 11:30.983
Got it!

11:31.066 --> 11:32.985
Cool! Ass ball!

11:33.068 --> 11:34.319
Peter, it worked!

11:34.403 --> 11:36.530
We found the portal
to the other side.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.409
Peter, what the hell
are you doing up there?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.452
We're gonna get
those terrorists.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.371
Now watch this drive.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.498
(both screaming)

11:46.582 --> 11:51.044
Stewie? Stewie, if you can hear me,
head for Meg's butt!

11:51.128 --> 11:52.921
STEWIE: (distorted)
Have you lost your mind?

11:53.005 --> 11:54.715
PETER: Hey, Lois,
get ready to laugh.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.925
Get ready to laugh.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.845
Gee, must've taken
a wrong turn at Albuquerque.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.054
(laughing)

12:05.434 --> 12:07.853
(whispering) Are you sure
Stewie can find his way out?

12:07.936 --> 12:10.147
(whispering) We just got to
be patient, Lois.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.774
Like waiting on
the results of a blood test.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.444
A real important
blood test.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.530
(whispering) Will I ever see
my baby brother again?

12:18.614 --> 12:22.034
Only if he can find his way
into the light, Chris.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.494
For some people,
it's easier than others.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.581
Some people just get lost
on the way to the light.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.958
They're walking along,
they stop and say,

12:30.042 --> 12:32.294
"Oh, is that
a new restaurant?

12:32.377 --> 12:34.004
"That place
must've just opened up

12:34.087 --> 12:37.633
"'cause I remember there was
another place there a few weeks ago.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.553
"I went in there once and there was a guy
with a harelip eating soup,

12:41.637 --> 12:43.555
"and I was like ew!

12:43.639 --> 12:46.308
"It wasn't the
restaurant's fault, I know.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.685
"But I still
never went back there.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.897
"I mean, I guess
there's only, like, a 1 in 50 chance

12:51.980 --> 12:54.816
"of me getting the same spoon
that he had,

12:54.900 --> 12:57.027
but I still
don't like them odds."

12:57.110 --> 12:59.154
(thunder rumbling)

12:59.238 --> 13:01.406
Oh,
I can't bear this anymore!

13:01.490 --> 13:04.076
If Stewie can't find
his way out of Meg's ass,

13:04.159 --> 13:07.079
we have to enter
the other realm and get him ourselves.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.081
Lois,
I told you it ain't safe.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.249
I'll tell you
what's not safe.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.084
Going hunting
with Dick Cheney.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.002
So,
you all set to go hunting?

13:20.342 --> 13:22.427
Sorry,
I thought you were a deer.

13:24.513 --> 13:25.764
Be careful, Lois.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.182
I will, Peter.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.276
I don't feel anything!

13:37.359 --> 13:40.445
Now she knows how I felt
when I was at her piano recital.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.989
(both laughing)

13:42.072 --> 13:43.699
No, you're doing fine, Meg.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.952
Oh, Stewie,
you're all right!

13:47.035 --> 13:48.912
Oh, thank God you guys are--

13:48.996 --> 13:50.289
Ew, you're covered in slime.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.417
Ugh! This must be how
Tom Arnold felt on his wedding night.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.626
(Meg screaming)

13:55.961 --> 13:58.172
Holy crap!
Let's get out of here.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.134
Wait a minute.
Where's Meg?

14:02.217 --> 14:03.468
I don't know.
I didn't see her.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.596
Yeah, I kind of thought
you guys would attend to that.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.973
-Peter, you got to go back and get her.
-Oh, yeah, right.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.766
-Like I'm going back for Meg.
-Peter!

14:09.850 --> 14:11.476
Lois, damn it,
we both agreed, remember?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.478
If we could only
save two, we leave Meg.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.063
I know, but...
You bastard!

14:15.147 --> 14:16.940
How could you
leave me in there?

14:17.024 --> 14:19.359
She's... Okay, see?
It resolved itself.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.488
Oh, I forgot one thing.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.169
A bit of breaking news.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.880
A local family is forced
out of their home by ghosts.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.423
Who are they gonna call?

14:41.507 --> 14:42.716
Ghostbusters, Tom?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.843
No, Diane,
their insurance company.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.512
That's just stupid
what you said.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.140
And now back to Disney's
Too Many Ostriches starring Don Knotts.

14:50.224 --> 14:53.185
There's way too
many ostriches.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.355
Why are there so
many ostriches?

14:56.438 --> 15:00.192
The brochure said
there'd only be a few ostriches.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.945
This is a terrible vacation!

15:05.280 --> 15:07.157
So, what was it like
on the other side?

15:07.241 --> 15:08.700
Well, I met Jesus up there.

15:08.784 --> 15:09.785
Wow, what's he like?

15:09.868 --> 15:11.620
Uh, believe it or not,
he's Chinese.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.830
Really?
Yup, Jesus is Chinese.

15:13.914 --> 15:17.125
In fact,
his last name is Hong. Jesus Hong.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.545
Says he has no idea
where people are getting Christ.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.673
Quagmire, you got to help us.
We pissed off a bunch of ghosts,

15:22.756 --> 15:25.342
and now our house is gone
and we got no place to stay.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.010
Uh, Peter,
this is not the best time.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.720
WOMAN: Glenn, are you coming?

15:28.804 --> 15:30.180
Yeah, honey,
I'll be right there.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.224
(mimicking baby crying)
I'll be right there.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.559
Peter,
I'm really slammed right now.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.643
Can you give me
the short version?

15:34.810 --> 15:37.771
Uh, what's, uh...
What's going on in there?

15:37.855 --> 15:39.022
Nothing.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.234
(donkey braying)

15:42.317 --> 15:44.278
So, uh, as you can see,
my family's here.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.905
And, uh it's--it's game night.

15:46.989 --> 15:50.075
We're playing... sex.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.790
Ugh, a soup kitchen, Dad?

15:56.874 --> 15:58.750
Isn't there any
other place we can go?

15:58.834 --> 15:59.918
We're homeless, Meg.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.503
This is where
homeless people go.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.589
Well, it'll just be good
to get some food in us.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.799
Hi, welcome to
the soup kitchen.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.217
I'll just start you
off with this basket

16:07.301 --> 16:09.344
of pizza crusts
and apple cores.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.555
Oh, and we do have
one special today.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.017
It's an avocado pit
with a little bit of avocado still on it,

16:15.100 --> 16:17.561
and that comes
on a ripped pair of boxer shorts.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.188
Now,
I'm trying to decide between

16:19.271 --> 16:21.190
the tossed spaghetti
on a newspaper

16:21.273 --> 16:23.692
and the half yogurt
with the balled-up tissue in it.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.490
Hi, there. Do you have any books
on how to get rid of ghosts?

16:30.574 --> 16:33.785
Have you tried telling them
you're ready for a commitment?

16:33.869 --> 16:35.204
(laughing)

16:36.830 --> 16:38.832
Oh, like a relationship.

16:38.916 --> 16:39.917
Exactly.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.044
That'll send
them running, huh?

16:42.878 --> 16:45.464
(laughing) I like her.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.217
Oh.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.344
Here you go.
Maybe this'll help.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.640
All right, here it is.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.727
"To vanquish poltergeists,
one must restore all disturbed remains

16:58.810 --> 17:00.479
to their
original resting places."

17:00.562 --> 17:03.982
So all we got to do is
bring the skull back home and bury it.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.317
What are you doing?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.528
You said you
were using the skull as an athletic cup.

17:07.611 --> 17:10.489
I was, but don't you remember,
I threw it in the garbage?

17:10.572 --> 17:11.740
Oh.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.201
-So, you're not wearing it now?
-No.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.411
That's, uh, pretty much
just me you're grabbing.

17:16.495 --> 17:19.706
That's how my old scoutmaster
shakes hands.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.212
(moaning)

17:28.924 --> 17:30.300
Ew! That is vile.

17:30.384 --> 17:33.178
I know. I hate myself,
but it's so good.

17:33.262 --> 17:35.013
(moaning)

17:35.097 --> 17:36.515
Can I help you
folks find something?

17:36.598 --> 17:37.599
No, we're just browsing.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.643
God, I hate it
when they pester you like that.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.603
Peter! Yes, we need help.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.565
We're looking for a skull
that my husband threw away.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.442
A skull, huh?
Then you want the human remains bin.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.820
But I should warn you folks,
we're pretty cleaned out right now,

17:49.903 --> 17:53.031
'cause Carrot Top comes by every morning
to rummage for new props.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.368
Well, then we'll just have to pay
this Carrot Top a visit.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.828
He's funny.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.496
Except for that
one show he did

17:59.580 --> 18:02.040
in Ohio after
the airline lost his luggage.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.043
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, Carrot Top!

18:05.127 --> 18:07.212
All right, you guys
look like a good crowd.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.464
I hope it goes well,
'cause I don't have my prop trunk.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.758
I normally have,
like, a--a case with all my little props

18:11.842 --> 18:13.093
and gadgets
and whatnot,

18:13.177 --> 18:14.511
but, it's okay,
you can use your imagination,

18:14.595 --> 18:16.763
like maybe a piece of luggage
that shoots dog biscuits.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.266
So, like, if you had, like, weed
in your bag and you went to the airport,

18:19.349 --> 18:20.851
you could shoot
the dog biscuits out,

18:20.934 --> 18:21.935
and then
the drug dog would be...

18:22.019 --> 18:23.270
Would go away from your bags.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.105
Kind of if you can
imagine the dog...

18:25.189 --> 18:26.940
(mimicking dog barking)
and then, the dog...

18:27.024 --> 18:29.443
Man, it's a lot
funnier if I had my prop.

18:31.153 --> 18:35.490
LOIS: Well, there it is.
Carrot Top Manor.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.458
So, you having a good time there,
Chief Diamond Phillips?

18:44.541 --> 18:46.418
Oh, that's funny.
He came up with the same thing that--

18:46.502 --> 18:48.962
All right, Carrot Top,
I want that skull.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.214
Who the hell are you?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.758
I'm Peter Griffin,
and that skull belongs to me.

18:52.841 --> 18:55.469
Well, it's hardly just
a skull, Mr. Griffin.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.888
I put it on my head,
and it's a skullcap!

18:57.971 --> 18:59.014
(laughing) It's a...

18:59.097 --> 19:01.642
Put it with David Duchovny,
and it's Agent Scully.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.145
You got to appreciate that--
Hey, don't distract me.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.314
Now, hand it over, Mr. Top.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.274
Very well, Mr. Griffin,
I'll give you the skull,

19:09.358 --> 19:10.859
but you have to
catch me first!

19:15.989 --> 19:18.492
Looks like you found me,
Mr. Griffin.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.245
But which one of us is
the real king of prop comedy

19:21.328 --> 19:23.247
and not just
an illusion, huh?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.249
That's right, Mr. Griffin.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.000
Just a little further.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.293
(screams)

19:31.004 --> 19:32.005
(chortles)

19:32.089 --> 19:33.590
Sucker.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.259
What the hell?

19:35.342 --> 19:36.969
How'd you get
through the trap door?

19:37.052 --> 19:38.804
I found this saw
with glasses on it.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.472
Oh, that's my see-saw.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.100
(laughing)

19:43.183 --> 19:46.186
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

19:46.270 --> 19:48.856
You are so (bleep) funny!

19:48.939 --> 19:50.315
You are so...

19:50.399 --> 19:53.026
(bleep) you
for being so funny!

19:53.110 --> 19:56.280
Oh, my God!
Oh, oh, God. You know what?

19:56.363 --> 19:57.531
Here, here, just,
you know what?

19:57.614 --> 19:59.992
Keep it, keep it.
You deserve it.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.035
Just take it.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.954
No, no, I need it.
I need it.

20:05.956 --> 20:09.710
Well, Chief, time for you to go back
where you came from.

20:18.135 --> 20:20.012
Peter, you did it.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.644
What the hell?

20:32.983 --> 20:35.068
Oh, Peter,
I'm so proud of you.

20:35.152 --> 20:38.197
Once again you brought our family
to the edge of the abyss,

20:38.280 --> 20:40.782
and at the very last minute,
you saved us all.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.034
I love you, honey.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.952
And I've grown
fond of you, Lois.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.746
Let's go home.

21:05.516 --> 21:07.726
(gentle theme playing)
