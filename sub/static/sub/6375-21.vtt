WEBVTT

00:11.100 --> 00:13.900
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH YOUR FEELINGS?

00:14.400 --> 00:17.100
WELL, I DID CONSIDER THROWING A DART AT THE REAL THING,

00:17.300 --> 00:20.000
BUT SHE'S SO DAMN FAST IN THOSE HEELS!

00:20.800 --> 00:22.900
CHRISTINA, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.600
BUT YOU'VE MISSED A LOT OF WORK,

00:25.600 --> 00:27.500
AND IT'S NOT THAT I MIND COVERING FOR YOU,

00:27.500 --> 00:31.300
BECAUSE I DON'T, BUT I HEMMED A SKIRT YESTERDAY

00:31.300 --> 00:32.299
WITH A STAPLE GUN.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.000
I'M SORRY, BETTY. IT'S JUST...

00:34.400 --> 00:37.600
IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD SINCE SHE'S BANNED ME FROM SEEING THE BABY.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.900
WE'VE BECOME REALLY ATTACHED TO THAT WEE BUGGER.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.200
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND SOME INTENSIVE SCOTTISH THERAPY.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.100
YOU'RE UP, STUART.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.300
LOOK, MAYBE COMING BACK TO WORK  WOULD HELP GET YOUR MIND OFF THINGS.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.600
MATT'S DAD'S COMING IN TO SIGN THE DEAL THAT'S GONNA HELP SAVE MEADE,

00:53.600 --> 00:55.000
AND WE'RE THROWING A PARTY!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.800
AND I ORDERED A COCONUT CAKE JUST FOR YOU.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.200
NO ONE ELSE EVEN LIKES COCONUT.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.200
OH, WELL, YOU DO MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.200
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU BE HAPPY AGAIN.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.200
I HATE SEEING YOU LIKE THIS.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.800
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.600
LISTEN, YOU COMING FOR A DRINK WITH ME IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.100
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.500
STOP.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
TO FRIENDS.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.600
TO BEST FRIENDS.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
OOH, ANOTHER ONE,I THINK.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.500
TWO MORE, PLEASE?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.800
(Betty) EVERYBODY, I'M HOME!

01:28.800 --> 01:31.300
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE HERE!

01:31.700 --> 01:33.300
WHY DO YOU SMELL LIKE JUNIOR HIGH?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.600
(Ignacio) HI,HOW'S CHRISTINA?

01:35.800 --> 01:38.300
GOOD. BETTER. I HOPE HE COMES TO WORK TOMORROW.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.200
OH, GOOD.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.000
AHEM! OKAY, NOW THAT EVERYBODY IS HERE--

01:42.000 --> 01:42.900
JUSTIN!

01:42.900 --> 01:43.700
WHAT?

01:43.700 --> 01:45.800
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.600
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED!

01:46.600 --> 01:47.900
YOU'RE GETTING TTMARRIED? (gasps)

01:49.000 --> 01:51.600
SETTLE, SETTLE. WE ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.400
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE PREGNANT!

01:53.500 --> 01:54.500
OH, SHE'S PREGNANT!

01:54.500 --> 01:55.400
HILDA,ARE YOU PREGNANT?

01:55.400 --> 01:56.200
OH, MY GOD.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.500
(Archie) NO.YOU GUYS, CUT IT OUT!

01:58.500 --> 02:00.300
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.100
LISTEN,TOMORROW...

02:03.500 --> 02:09.400
ARCHIE IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE LAUNCH OF HIS CAMPAIGN...

02:09.600 --> 02:11.000
FOR PRESIDENT!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.500
BOROUGH PRESIDENT.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.400
IT'S STILL PRESIDENT.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.100
THAT'S SO GREAT!

02:17.100 --> 02:18.700
HOW EXCITING, ARCHIE.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.500
CONGRATULATIONS,MR. PRESIDENT.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.000
HEY, HEY, HUH?
LOOK, HE HAD T-SHIRTS MADE.

02:23.000 --> 02:23.900
OH, LET ME SEE.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.300
I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR THAT, DO I?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.600
HEY. "VOTE ARCHIE RODRIGUEZ--

02:27.600 --> 02:30.400
AN A-ROD YOU CAN BELIEVE IN." GOOD ONE.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.500
VERY CLEVER.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.600
I DON'T GET IT.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.100
NOW I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.400
AS PART OF THE LAUNCH,NEWS 12 IS DOING A FEATURE ON ME TOMORROW.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.800
I WANT YOU TO BE IN IT.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.300
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:41.300 --> 02:43.200
YEAH,YOU'VE INSPIRED ME.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.500
I FIGURED IF I COULD GET SOMEONE LIKE YOU,

02:44.500 --> 02:45.500
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL--

02:45.500 --> 02:46.500
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.100
OOH! YEAH, I DON'T PPKNOW WHAT TO SAY!

02:51.300 --> 02:53.000
(giggles) I'M GONNA BE FIRST LADY.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.100
YEAH, OKAY, SORT OF.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.400
I HAVE TO WIN FIRST.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.800
OKAY, WELL, BIGGER PICTURE--

02:56.800 --> 02:57.900
YOU'RE GONNA BE ON TV TOMORROW,

02:57.900 --> 02:59.500
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO LOOK TASTEFUL.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.600
AND LET'S JUST SAY YOUR CLOSET PRESENTS SOME... CHALLENGES.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.400
HEY, I COULD GET YOU SOME OUTFITS FROM "MODE."

03:06.600 --> 03:08.200
I'LL HAVE THEM MESSENGERED FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.100
YOU'RE GONNA PPGIVE ME CLOTHES?

03:10.100 --> 03:12.200
NO, I'M LENDING YOU CLOTHES.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.200
WE'LL SEE. (chuckles)

03:20.200 --> 03:21.300
CHRISTINA?

03:22.800 --> 03:23.900
HAVE YOU SEEN CHRISTINA?

03:24.200 --> 03:24.900
NO.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.900
(groans) WHY ARE YOU STILL NOT HERE?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.600
WHY DID I GET COCONUT CAKE?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.800
HEY, HILDA,DID YOU GET THE DRESSES?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.700
YES, THANK YOU, I DID.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.600
BUT I GOT A QUESTION.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.200
HOW BOOBY CAN A FIRST LADY BE?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.400
OR SHOULD I PLAY UP MY ARMS LIKE MICHELLE OBAMA?

03:40.400 --> 03:41.800
WELL, WHY CAN'T YOU XXDO BOTH?

03:41.800 --> 03:44.500
GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHY I AM SO NERVOUS ABOUT ALL OF THIS!

03:44.500 --> 03:47.000
WELL, BECAUSE ARCHIE ASKED YOU TO BE ON TV WITH HIM.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.300
THAT'S SORT OF A BIG DEAL.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.700
I KNOW, I KNOW.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.700
PPIT'S LIKE HE ASKED ME TO BE PART OF HIS FUTURE OR SOMETHING.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.600
HOLD ON. CLOSET.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.900
UH, NO,CHRISTINA IS NOT HERE...

03:59.900 --> 04:01.200
RIGHT--RIGHT NOW.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.100
Can I, uh, tell her you called?

04:03.300 --> 04:04.000
OKAY, BYE.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.200
She's still not in yet?

04:06.200 --> 04:07.400
Yeah, I don't know how much longer 

04:07.400 --> 04:08.700
I CAN KEEP COVERING FOR HER.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.000
I MEAN, AT SOME POINT, I HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE, RIGHT?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.200
LISTEN, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO, YOU KNOW?

04:13.400 --> 04:15.000
At some point, she's gotta make her own decisions.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.899
SO THE CAMERA ADDS 10 YEARS, RIGHT?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.700
10 pounds.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.400
OH, CRAP, I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.400 --> 04:33.700
(sighs) OH, CAN YOU PUT THAT UP HIGHER?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.600
OKAY, EVERYONE, HARTLEY'S COMING AT 11:00 A.M. SHARP,

04:36.600 --> 04:38.200
SO PLEASE,LET'S PICK UP THE PACE.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.600
GOOD MORNING!

04:39.800 --> 04:40.900
HEY, BETTY,WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.100
LOOKS GREAT.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.500
YEAH, DID YOU CHECK OUT THE OMELET BAR?

04:43.500 --> 04:44.400
IT'S A NICE TOUCH, HUH?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.800
EVERYONE LOVES AN OMELET BAR.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.100
OH, DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO PRINT UP

04:47.100 --> 04:48.400
THE FOURTH-QUARTER PROJECTIONS?

04:48.400 --> 04:49.100
YES.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.700
I REALLY WANTED YOU TO PUT THEM IN THE FANCY PLASTIC--

04:50.700 --> 04:51.600
PLASTIC COVERS?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.400
RELAX, DANIEL.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.600
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.400
YOU'VE GOT A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION,

04:56.400 --> 04:58.700
AMAZING VISUALS AND AN OMELET BAR.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.300
BETTY, COME ON.
THE MAN MADE ME DRESS UP IN A BUNNY COSTUME.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.300
I HAVE TO PROVE TO HIM THAT I DESERVE RESPECT.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.500
BESIDES, NOTHING'S OFFICIAL UNTIL HE SIGNS ON THE DOTTED LINE.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.000
LOWER THAT, WILL YA?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.300
OH, WILLIAM.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.500
HI, WILLIAM.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.100
HI.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.800
OH, THANK YOU, BETTY.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.200
THAT'LL BE WORTH AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF THERAPY.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.700
UH, DANIEL, WILL YOU HOLD HIM?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.100
HE IS YOUR HALF BROTHER.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.500
OH, UH, O-OKAY.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.000
(sighs) BEFORE WE START OUR PRESENTATION,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.200
I WANT HARTLEY TO HOLD HIM.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.000
WHY?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.100
WELL, I HEARD HE HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR KIDS.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.900
APPARENTLY, ALL HIS CHARITIES BENEFIT "THE CHILDREN."

05:37.300 --> 05:39.400
SO ONCE HE GETS A GLANCE AT MY LITTLE ANGEL,

05:39.400 --> 05:41.700
HE WILL BE PUTTY IN OUR HANDS.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.200
YOU PUT ONE IN YOUR ARMS,AND YOU TURN INTO A GRINNING IDIOT... 

05:46.200 --> 05:47.400
LIKE THAT.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.500
IN DANIEL'S DEFENSE,HE ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE THAT.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.600
OH, STUPID NANNY.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.700
SHE PACKED A SWEATER WITH A LOOSE BUTTON.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.700
WILL YOU TAKE THIS DOWN TO THE CLOSET 

05:58.700 --> 06:00.300
AND HAVE CHRISTINA SEW IT UP, PLEASE?

06:00.300 --> 06:01.500
RIGHT AWAY, FRAULEIN.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.100
DID YOU SAY FROWN LINE?

06:03.100 --> 06:03.800
NO.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.900
I CAN TAKE IT TO CHRISTINA.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.700
I'M GOING DOWN THERE NOW,ANYWAY.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.400
I CAN GET IT DONE IN A JIFFY!

06:12.600 --> 06:13.600
SHE'S STRONG.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
OW! SON OF A... MMM.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.400
OH, YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BUILD UP CALLUSES LIKE MINE.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.300
(gasps) CHRISTINA,YOU MADE IT!

06:24.300 --> 06:25.200
BRIGHT-EYED AND BUSHY-TAILED.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.900
NOW WE CAN START BY LETTING ME HAVE THAT.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.000
OH, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.300
I CAN--
NOW COME--JUST--

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
OH, IT'S THE, UH...

06:33.900 --> 06:35.000
THE BABY'S HERE.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.100
YEAH. SORRY.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.200
NO, IT'S OKAY.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.300
IT'S FINE.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I CAN HANDLE IT.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.900
I AM A MATURE WOMAN.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.600
I JUST WISH I'D BROUGHT MY DARTS.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
LET'S STAY SHARP.HARTLEY'S HERE ANY SECOND.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.700
IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS, MARC.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.100
PUT ON YOUR GAME FACE.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.200
NOT YOUR GAY FACE--

07:13.200 --> 07:14.400
YOUR GAME FACE.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.700
THEY'RE THE SAME FACE.

07:16.000 --> 07:16.800
YOU'RE FINE.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.600
THANKS.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.700
OH, COME ON!

07:30.700 --> 07:31.600
HI, STEVE!

07:31.600 --> 07:32.500
WRONG FLOOR.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.500

07:37.300 --> 07:38.100

07:51.800 --> 07:52.800
OH, GREAT.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.800
BETTY, ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.900
AGES AGO.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.800
I'M SURPRISED YOU REMEMBERED ME.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.500
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.000
I AM WILHELMINA SLATER.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.100
DAMN, THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE STAFF.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.800
AW... THANK YOU!

08:12.800 --> 08:15.800
SHOULD WE, UH, TAKE A TOUR,OR DO YOU WANNA GO STRAIGHT TO THE OMELET BAR?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.100
WHY DON'T YOU START WITHOUT ME?

08:17.100 --> 08:19.000
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON MY BABY.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.100
WHA--IS THERE A BABY HERE?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
CAN I SEE HIM?

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
I LOVE BABIES!

08:22.600 --> 08:23.400
YOU DO?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.900
ALWAYS HAVE. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN'T ASK ME FOR MONEY.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.600
OVER HERE? OH.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.800
RIGHT THIS WAY.YES, YES.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.400
DADDY MORE-BUCKS IS KIND OF OLD, BUT HOT.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.400
DO US ALL A FAVOR AND WAIT TILL AFTER HE SIGNS THE DEAL TO JUMP HIS BONES.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.100
I MAKE NO PROMISES.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.700
HERE HE IS.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.400
IS THIS A JOKE?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.300
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.500
MARC, WHERE'S WILLIAM?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.400
UH, HE WAS IN HERE NAPPING A MINUTE AGO.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.000
HAS ANYONE SEEN THE BABY?

09:14.600 --> 09:15.700
OH, MY GOD.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.600

09:31.600 --> 09:33.800

09:33.800 --> 09:35.800
MARC, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MONITORING HIM!

09:35.800 --> 09:38.000
I WAS, I WAS.PPI DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.800
HE--HE WAS ONLY ALONE FOR LESS THAN A MINUTE!

09:40.200 --> 09:41.400
(groans) HOW COULD YOU VVBE SO STUPID?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
I'LL CALL SECURITY.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.500
HAVE THEM LOCK DOWN THE BUILDING.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.200
COME ON, MARC,CALL THE POLICE.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.900
WILHELMINA, DON'T WORRY.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.200
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.600
I KNOW WHERE RRTO START LOOKING.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.500
(Betty) CHRISTINA!

09:51.500 --> 09:54.200
OH! I THOUGHT SUCKING UP TO THE RICH GUY WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.500
WILLIAM'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.600
WHAT? WHEN?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.400
JUST NOW!

09:58.400 --> 09:59.200
OH, MY GOD.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.100
SHE DID IT--

10:00.100 --> 10:01.700
THAT UNGRATEFUL FOREIGN WOMAN.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.800
OW! WHAT--

10:03.800 --> 10:04.900
(scoffs) NOT HER,THE WHITE ONE.

10:04.900 --> 10:05.700
ARREST HER!

10:05.800 --> 10:07.900
NO! NO. JUST GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.100
I-I DIDN'T DO IT!

10:09.300 --> 10:10.800
I WAS HERE THE WHOLE TIME!

10:10.900 --> 10:12.300
CHRISTINA DIDN'T DO THIS.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.800
WE WILL LET THE COPS DECIDE.

10:13.900 --> 10:17.000
NO ONE LEAVES HERE UNTIL THEY SPEAK TO THE POLICE.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.100
THAT INCLUDES YOU.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.400
BREAKING NEWS.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.800
TODAY'S HOT COLOR--AMBER--

10:26.200 --> 10:27.400
AS IN "ALERT."

10:27.700 --> 10:29.200
THE GOLDEN CHILD OF WILHELMINA SLATER

10:29.200 --> 10:31.500
AND THE LATE BRADFORD MEADE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.600
ALL MEADE EMPLOYEES ARE BEING QUESTIONED.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
INFORMATION IS SCARCE,

10:34.600 --> 10:38.500
BUT, I, SUZUKI ST. PIERRE,HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE WITH AN EYEWITNESS.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.200
OH, HEY, THERE.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.200
OH, BEFORE WE START,I'LL ONLY SPEAK ON THE CONDITION OF UNANIMITY.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.800
DO YOU MEAN "ANONYMITY"?

10:46.300 --> 10:47.400
EXACTLY.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
BUT YOU'RE ON TV.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.000
EVERYONE CAN SEE YOU.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.100
I KNOW.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.400
OKAY, CUT. CUT.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.000
TAKE FIVE.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.300
I'M GETTING AN OMELET.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

10:55.700 --> 10:56.900
WHO WOULD KIDNAP A BABY?

10:57.400 --> 11:00.100
I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST WILHELMINA TO DO IT HERSELF.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.400
MOM, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.200
BESIDES, GIVEN YOUR PAST,YOU'RE A MUCH MORE LIKELY SUSPECT.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.900
YOU DIDN'T DO IT,DID YOU?

11:05.900 --> 11:07.000
OH! OF COURSE NOT.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.600
KIDNAPPING ISN'T MY M.O. AT ALL.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.800
IT DISTURBS ME THAT MY MOTHER HAS AN M.O.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.000
MR. HARTLEY.
YEAH.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I'M GONNA HAVE BETTY RESCHEDULE THE PRESENTATION.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.200
WHY DO WE NEED TO RESCHEDULE?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.100
UH, NO,JUST BECAUSE OF--

11:22.100 --> 11:23.300
YEAH, LOOK,DON'T GET ME WRONG. 

11:23.300 --> 11:25.700
IT--IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT THERE'S A CHILD MISSING.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.200
BUT TOMORROW MORNING,I GET ON A PLANE FOR MOSCOW.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.200
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOCK THIS THING DOWN TODAY,

11:33.200 --> 11:34.100
OR THAT'S IT.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.700
ALL RIGHT, UM...

11:38.000 --> 11:39.100
EXCUSE ME JUST A SECOND.

11:46.100 --> 11:49.100
MS. SLATER SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOUR FRIEND CHRISTINA McKINNEY

11:49.100 --> 11:51.400
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HER CHILD.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.000
NO, SHE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
SHE LOVES THAT BABY. SHE'S AS DEVASTATED AS ANYONE ELSE.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.600
WHICH GIVES HER EVEN MORE OF A MOTIVE.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.800
LOOK, SHE ALREADY TOLD YOU,

12:00.800 --> 12:02.700
SHE WAS IN THE CLOSET THE WHOLE TIME.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
DO YOU EVEN HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT SHE DID ANYTHING?

12:05.800 --> 12:07.200
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING TO YOU, MISS SUAREZ.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.200
(sighs) DETECTIVE, I HAVE KNOWN CHRISTINA FOR YEARS.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.800
THERE IS NO WAY SHE COULD'VE DONE THIS. 

12:14.500 --> 12:15.300
OKAY.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.400
YOU CAN GO.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.300
BUT, UH, IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP,

12:20.300 --> 12:21.100
HERE'S MY CARD.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.200
CHRISTINA! 

12:30.100 --> 12:31.000
HI, HILDA.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.500
(Hilda) Archie hated the dresses.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.800
HE SAYS THEY'RE TOO FANCY.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.100
HE WANTS TO REPRESENT HIMSELF AS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE

12:36.100 --> 12:38.100
AND DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE THE NEXT SARAH PALIN.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.700
HILDA, CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.400
WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.900
OKAY, WHAT IS THE EMERGENCY?

12:42.900 --> 12:43.700
STRIPES ARE OVER?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.000
NO, WILHELMINA'S BABY'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.700
OH... GOD. THEN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING TO ME FOR?

12:49.700 --> 12:50.900
Go! Go!

12:53.100 --> 12:56.600
AMANDA, DO YOU KNOW WHERE CHRISTINA IS?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.800
BETTY, WHEN I MARRY MR. HARTLEY,

12:58.800 --> 13:00.200
I'M GONNA BE YOUR MOM.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.900
UH, AMANDA, I NEED YOU TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.900
DON'T TALK TO YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY. GO TO YOUR ROOM.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.100
AMANDA, DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT KNOW WHERE CHRISTINA IS?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.700
FINE. SHE JUST LEFT.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
THE POLICE RELEASED HER?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.900
I GUESS. SHE DID SEEM PRETTY UPSET.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.400
WELL, OF COURSE SHE'S UPSET. 

13:16.400 --> 13:18.700
THE BABY IS MISSING,AND EVERYONE'S ACCUSING HER.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.800
WILL YOU TELL DANIEL I'LL BE BACK?

13:24.200 --> 13:26.000
(sighs) THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.800
OKAY?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.300
CHRISTINA!

13:46.700 --> 13:47.800
CHRISTINA, WAIT!

13:47.800 --> 13:49.100
BETTY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:49.200 --> 13:50.300
WAS THAT STUART?

13:50.300 --> 13:52.600
YEAH, I'M JUST TAKING HIS CAR HOME.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.500
I KINDA NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THERE.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.400
YEAH, I KNOW. YOU'RE UPSET.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.800
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE DRIVING?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.200
BETTY, I'LL BE FINE, REALLY.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.700
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.900
JUST GO BACK TO WORK.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.400
NO, NO, I CAN GO BACK IN A MINUTE.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.100
BETTY,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:08.100 --> 14:09.800
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.700
WELL, I AM.I'M--I'M OKAY.I'M OKAY.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
NO, CHRISTINA,YOU DON'T SEEM OKAY.YOU SEEM REALLY WORRIED,

14:15.200 --> 14:16.400
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
CHRISTINA,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.400
I JUST--I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.500
CHRISTINA!

14:31.000 --> 14:32.700
YOU TOOK THE BABY!

14:37.800 --> 14:40.000
CHRISTINA,HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.200
I DON'T KNOW!

14:41.800 --> 14:45.800
WHEN YOU TOLD ME THE BABY WAS IN THE OFFICE,I-I JUST SNAPPED.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.600
AND THEN WHEN EVERYONE WENT TO THE ELEVATOR,

14:48.100 --> 14:50.600
I JUST TOOK HIM,AND THEN I CALLED STUART.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.400
YOU KNOW, I DEFENDED YOU TO THE POLICE

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
I'M A PART OF THIS NOW.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.000
I'M ACCOMPLICE TO A KIDNAPPING.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.200
BETTY, IT'S NOT A KIDNAPPING WHEN IT'S YOUR OWN SON.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.600
IT'S NOT YOUR CHILD.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.300
CHRISTINA, THERE WAS A TEST.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.000
THE BABY IS WILHELMINA'S!

15:03.000 --> 15:04.800
AND YOU THINK THAT WILHELMINA IS NOT CAPABLE OF--

15:04.800 --> 15:06.900
OF FAKING A D.N.A. TEST?

15:07.300 --> 15:11.100
BETTY, SHE NEEDS THAT CHILD  TO HOLD ON TO HER PLACE AT MEADE.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.100
THIS IS INSANE.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.400
THIS IS CRAZY.WE HAVE TO GO BACK.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.300
YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE BABY.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.500
I CAN'T. I CAN'T GO BACK.

15:16.900 --> 15:17.800
THEY'LL ARREST ME.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.800
OH! OH, GOD. 

15:23.300 --> 15:26.000
OH, I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'TMEAN FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.000
 AND THIS CHART CLEARLY SHOWS THE FOURTH-QUARTER PROJECTIONS.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.500
SO AS YOU CAN SEE,EVEN IN A BAD ECONOMY,

15:35.500 --> 15:37.300
MODE"" SALES HAVE INCREASED."

15:37.700 --> 15:41.200
WE'VE ALREADY LINED UP KATE BECKINSALE,PENELOPE CRUZ, ANNE HATHAWAY

15:41.200 --> 15:42.300
FOR THE FALL COVER--

15:43.300 --> 15:44.300
IS THIS A JOKE?

15:44.300 --> 15:46.400
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY CHILD!

15:48.700 --> 15:52.000
HATHAWAY--SHE, UM, SHE'S HOT.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.700
SORRY. UH, I MEAN,SHE'S HOT RIGHT NOW.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.200
I'M SORRY.

16:06.200 --> 16:10.000
MR. HARTLEY... THIS DEAL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.400
BUT, UH, MY PARTNER'S SON HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED--

16:13.400 --> 16:14.500
MY HALF BROTHER.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.200
SO YOU'RE ASKING IF YOU CAN RESCHEDULE,

16:17.200 --> 16:20.600
EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU THIS IS THE ONLY TIMEI CAN DO THIS?

16:21.100 --> 16:22.900
YES, I AM.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.300
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.400
I'M GONNA MAKE TIME BEFORE MY FLIGHT TOMORROW MORNING.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.300
HI.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.900
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.200
WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.700
YOUR TAILLIGHT IS OUT.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.500
OH. JUST THE TAILLIGHT?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.599
IS ROAD SAFETY A JOKE TO YOU?

17:16.599 --> 17:21.400
NO, MA'AM. ACTUALLY,I WAS SALLY THE SAFETY DUCK ALL THROUGH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.900
WAIT HERE.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.700
CHRISTINA, CAN WE PLEASE JUST TAKE WILLIAM BACK BEFORE THIS GETS WORSE?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.100
BETTY, HE'S MY SON.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.000
CHRISTINA!

17:32.000 --> 17:33.300
NO, LOOK, LOOK.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.000
OKAY, IT'S A PICTURE OF WILLIAM.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.400
IT'S A PICTURE OF ME AS A BABY.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.000
BETTY, YOU KNOW ME.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.500
YOU--YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING 

17:42.500 --> 17:44.900
AS CRAZY AS THIS IF I WASN'T 100% SURE.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.900
PLEASE?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.100
I'M GONNA LET YOU OFF WITH A WARNING,

17:49.400 --> 17:51.700
BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO GET THAT TAILLIGHT FIXED.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.500
I PROMISE.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.500
WHOSE BABY IS THIS?

17:54.500 --> 17:55.300
(Betty and Christina) MINE.

17:56.100 --> 17:56.900
OURS.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.200
THE BABY IS OURS.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.300
WILL BOTH YOU LADIES STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

18:11.300 --> 18:13.000
AROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR, PLEASE, MA'AM.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.700
YOU, TOO, MISS.AROUND TO THE FRONT.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.600
WHAT WERE YOU LADIES THINKING?

18:24.100 --> 18:25.600

18:25.600 --> 18:27.400
YOU GOTTA USE THE LOCKING CLIP.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.700
IT'S SAFER. (laughs) MY PARTNER AND I HAVE THE SAME ONE.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.300
THE CAR SEAT,NOT THE BABY. 

18:35.000 --> 18:36.600
ALL RIGHT,HAVE A GOOD ONE, LADIES.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.300
OKAY.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.400
OH, BETTY,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

18:48.700 --> 18:52.200
CHRISTINA, LOOK, I BELIEVE YOU, OKAY?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.000
YEAH.BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THINGS.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.600
I JUST WISH YOU WOULD'VE COME TO ME FIRST.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.500
NEXT TIME.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.000
LET'S JUST GET SOMEWHERE SAFE SO WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.100
JEEZ,I CAN'T READ THIS WATCH.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.500
LET'S JUST SAY HOUR FOUR OF THE SLATER-MEADE KIDNAPPING.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.000

19:11.000 --> 19:13.200
SO WE'RE FORCED TO CONFINE OUR REPORTING TO GOOD, 

19:13.200 --> 19:15.500
OLD-FASHIONED WILD SPECULATION.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.700
NOW THE BOYS IN THE F.X. DEPARTMENT  

19:17.700 --> 19:20.100
HAVE USED AGE-PROGRESSION SOFTWARE

19:20.100 --> 19:22.600
TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SPAWN OF BRADFORD MEADE

19:22.600 --> 19:26.200
AND WILHELMINA SLATER WOULD LOOK LIKE BY 20.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.300
MOTHER OF PEARL,THE MAN IS AN ADONIS.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.300
THE WORLD CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS SPECIMEN.

19:38.700 --> 19:39.600
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE LISTENING,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.400
I MAKE THIS DEMAND OF THE KIDNAPPERS--

19:41.700 --> 19:43.000

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000

19:53.500 --> 19:54.700
(woman) WE'RE GONNA SET UP IN THE SALON.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.800
THAT'S PERFECT, THANKS.

19:56.300 --> 20:00.100
NICE WORK, GETTING THEM TO SHOOT IN MY SALON.
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.200
WELL, YOUR SALON IS AN EXAMPLE OF MY SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESS.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.200
AND IT'S THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT THAT WILL PULL THIS COUNTRY RIGHT OUT OF--

20:06.200 --> 20:08.400
YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.YOU ALREADY GOT MY VOTE.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.400
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A CLEAR SHOT OF MY SIGN.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
OH, OKAY.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.200
HEY, THANKS FOR TONING DOWN THE OUTFIT, HUH?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.500
NO PROBLEM.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.600
THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS THING.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.900
(woman) UM, COUNCILMAN,WE'RE READY TO CHECK YOUR MIKE.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.200
UM, THANKS. SEE YOU IN A BIT.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.000
OKAY, JUST WIPE THAT--

20:27.000 --> 20:27.800
OKAY.
OKAY. (sighs)

20:30.200 --> 20:31.400
...THIS DRAMA WILL UNFOLD.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.400
THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS,

20:34.500 --> 20:37.100
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS THAT KIDNAPPED BABY?

20:37.800 --> 20:40.500
IF THE BABY SNATCHERS HAVE ANY SENSE OF DECENCY AT ALL,

20:40.500 --> 20:43.000
THEY'LL TAKE THE GENETICALLY BLESSED BAMBINO TO...

20:43.000 --> 20:44.300
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.500
WE FOUND THIS FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA IN THE STAIRWELL.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.800
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU FIRST,AS PER OUR USUAL AGREEMENT.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.100
HIT IT.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.700
UH, COULD YOU PAUSE,PLEASE?

21:10.500 --> 21:13.200
UM, TROY, MAY WE HAVE A MOMENT ALONE?

21:15.000 --> 21:15.800
COME ON, YOU.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
WHO'S THAT?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.900
THAT IS CHRISTINA'S HUSBAND STUART.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.500
(gasps) GREAT SCOTT!

21:27.200 --> 21:28.700
I'M SORRY. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SAY THAT.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.400
SO SHE REALLY DID TAKE THE BABY.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.800
OH, SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

21:32.800 --> 21:33.900
THE BABY'S SAFE.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.700
NOW ALL WE NEED TO FIND CHRISTINA IS A TEAM OF BOOZE-SNIFFING HOUNDS.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.800
WIL, IT'S OKAY. CHRISTINA WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT LITTLE WILLIAM.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.300
IN A FEW HOURS,HE'LL BE BACK SAFE AND SOUND 

21:48.000 --> 21:49.500
IN HIS NANNY'S ARMS.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.200
WE DON'T HAVE A FEW HOURS.

21:51.700 --> 21:55.600
IF CHRISTINA HAS THE BABY,THEN THE TRUTH IS GOING TO GET OUT.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.000
WHAT TRUTH ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

21:59.700 --> 22:02.400
I HAD THE D.N.A. TEST FAKED.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.200
THE BABY'S NOT MINE.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.900
IT'S CHRISTINA'S.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.000
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
YOU FAKED THE D.N.A. TEST IN ORDER TO CLAIM CHRISTINA'S BABY AS YOUR OWN.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.400
THE BIGGER PICTURE, FOOL.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.000
IF IT GETS OUT THAT THIS BABY IS NOT MINE,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.100
I LOSE MY CLAIM TO THE MEADE FORTUNE.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.200
I'M FIRED, AND YOU ALONG WITH ME.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.100
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

22:29.100 --> 22:31.900
WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT BABY IS SO THEY DON'T DISCOVER THE TRUTH.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.700
HOW? CHRISTINA COULD BE ANYWHERE.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.800
OKAY. I'M A SCOTTISH SEAMSTRESS/KIDNAPPER 

22:39.100 --> 22:41.500
AND I HAVE A PASTY COMPLEXION.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.400
WHERE DO I TURN?

22:47.100 --> 22:50.300
YOU WOULD TURN TO YOUR BEST FRIEND.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.000
BETTY.
BETTY.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.000
OH, MY GOD. YOU GUYS ARE THE KIDNAPPERS?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.200
I TOTALLY CALLED THAT. 

22:58.200 --> 23:00.400
SHH! NO, WE'RE NOT KIDNAPPERS. 

23:00.400 --> 23:02.400
WELL, OKAY, TECHNICALLY,WE'RE KIDNAPPERS,

23:02.400 --> 23:04.300
BUT IT--IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.400
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.700
 I GOTTA  GO TELL ALL MY FRIENDS

23:06.700 --> 23:09.300
WHOA, YOU GO UP TO YOUR ROOM AND YOU DON'T SAY A WORD.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.100
YOU GOT THAT?

23:10.100 --> 23:12.000
BUT ALL THIS DRAMA--I CAN'T EVEN TELL THE DRAMA CLUB?

23:12.000 --> 23:12.900
ZIP.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.300
FINE.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.900
YOU GUYS GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.300
IF REPORTERS THINK THAT ARCHIE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

23:19.300 --> 23:21.300
HIS CAREER IS THROUGH,AND THEN WE ARE THROUGH.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.700
HILDA, JUST KEEP THEM IN THE SALON.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.900
WE'LL SNEAK UP THE STAIRS.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.400
THEY'LL NEVER EVEN KNOW WE WERE HERE.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.900
ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE HOUSE.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.300
WELL, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

23:29.300 --> 23:32.000
I DON'T CARE. I JUST DON'T WANT ARCHIE TO SEE YOU HERE.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.800
HILDA? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

23:35.400 --> 23:36.800
(chuckles) YEAH.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.300
EVERYTHING IS GREAT.NEVER BETTER!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.300
FINE, I WILL DISTRACT THEM.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.900
BUT THIS ISN'T OVER.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.400
(Hilda) OKAY, EVERYBODY!

23:46.500 --> 23:49.000
LET'S GET THOSE CAMERAS ROLLING.
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.700
HOW ABOUT EVERYBODY FACES ME AS I STAND AGAINST THE WINDOW?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.300
OH, HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN ARCHIE'S POSTER,

23:55.300 --> 23:56.800
HOW HANDSOME HE IS?

23:56.800 --> 23:57.700
COME ON, STOP.

23:57.700 --> 23:58.800
OH, NO, THAT'S GREAT.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.000
WHY DON'T WE USE WHILE WE'RE--

24:00.000 --> 24:01.500
YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY,I PREFER THE WINDOW.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.900
I LIKE TO BE BACKLIT.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.300
IT'S VERY... SPIELBERG.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.700
WAS THAT A BABY?

24:12.000 --> 24:15.100
NO, THAT WAS JUSTIN, MY SON.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.800
MEGAN FOX AND BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN BROKE UP AGAIN.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.300
HE WAS REALLY PULLING FOR THEM, SO HE'S JUST...

24:20.300 --> 24:22.400
WELL, HERE'S WHAT I WAS THINKING IS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY

24:22.400 --> 24:23.700
COME THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR...

24:23.700 --> 24:25.500
AND THEN WE CAN SHOW THAT WE'RE INSIDE A HOUSE.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.100
YOU KNOW, YOU WANNA GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?I JUST HAD AN IDEA--GENIUS.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.300
ARCHIE, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD REALLY SHOW THEM?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.700
THE YIELD SIGN YOU HAD INSTALLED DOWN THE BLOCK.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.000
WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO SEE A YIELD SIGN?

24:40.300 --> 24:44.200
BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR FIRST ACT AS COUNCILMAN.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.900
FIRST SMALL STEP ON THE WAY TO GREATNESS.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.500
ACTUALLY, I LOVE IT.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.600
IF YOU WERE SMART, YOU'D HIREHER AS YOUR PUBLICIST.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.400
WELL, O-OKAY.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.200
SEE? COME ON.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.400
I'LL SHOW YOU THE SIGN.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.000
BEFORE IT WAS THERE,THERE WAS NO YIELDING.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.200
IT WAS CHAOS. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.400
HE HAS SAVED THE DAY--

24:58.400 --> 24:59.700
ARCHIE RODRIGUEZ.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.600
YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME, MIJA?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.400
OH, HI, STUART.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.900
I'M AFRAID WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A DETOUR.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.300
KIDNAPPING. AY, DIOS MIO.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.100
THAT'S GOTTA BE, LIKE,10,000 HAIL MARYS.

25:21.100 --> 25:21.900
PAPI--

25:22.000 --> 25:25.800
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ASKED WHERE YOU SHOULD DRAW THE LINE WHEN HELPING A FRIEND?

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
YOU JUST CROSSED IT.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.000
HILDA, WE HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.300
PAPI, YOU UNDERSTAND,RIGHT?

25:30.300 --> 25:31.100
I'M TRYING TO.

25:31.100 --> 25:35.100
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA DISCUSS THE FACT THAT YOU KIDNAPPED A BABY, 

25:35.100 --> 25:37.400
BUT THEN TO BRING HIM HERE WITH ARCHIE'S CAMPAIGN ON THE LINE?

25:37.400 --> 25:38.300
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO?

25:38.500 --> 25:39.500
SHE NEEDED MY HELP.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.200
I COULDN'T JUST TURN MY BACK ON HER.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.500
BUT, BETTY, SHE DIDN'T JUST JUMP A SUBWAY TURNSTILE.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.500
THIS IS KIDNAPPING!

25:44.500 --> 25:48.500
I KNOW, BUT SHE THINKSTHAT BABY IS HERS,AND I BELIEVE HER.

25:49.100 --> 25:51.500
MIJA, EVEN IF IT IS,WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO?

25:51.500 --> 25:54.900
I DON'T KNOW. GET ANOTHER D.N.A. TEST, SOMETHING.

25:55.100 --> 25:59.100
OKAY, SO WE JUST MAYBEDROP BY THE D.N.A. PAGODAAT THE MALL.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.400
OKAY, HILDA, OKAY.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.600
I GET IT. WE NEED HELP.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.600
YEAH, BUT WHO'S GONNA HELP A FUGITIVE 

26:09.300 --> 26:10.300
MODE MAGAZINE.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.000
OH, HEY, BETTY. YES,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I'LL CONNECT YOU TO CLAIRE.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.200
OW! MY HAIR!

26:16.200 --> 26:17.900
(whispers) SORRY.
Hello. This is Claire.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.200
(Betty) Mrs. Meade,I really need your help.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.200
BETTY, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING BY CALLING ME.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.700
DR. GELOBTER IS A CLOSE FRIEND.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.700
HE'LL GET THE TEST DONE QUICKLY AND QUIETLY.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH,MRS. MEADE.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.200
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU STICKING YOUR NECK OUT LIKE THIS FOR US.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.000
WELL, BETTY'S HELPED ME MANY TIMES IN THE PAST.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.100
I'M ONLY TOO HAPPY TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.600
AND ONCE WE PROVE THAT THIS BABY ISN'T WILHELMINA'S,

26:46.600 --> 26:48.900
WE'LL FINALLY BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THAT BITCH.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.400
(man) POLICE.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.500
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.300
(man) PUT DOWN THE BABY!

27:02.300 --> 27:04.100
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!DON'T MOVE!

27:05.100 --> 27:06.500
(man) MA'AM, HAND OVER THE BABY NOW.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.000
GIVE UP THE BABY.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.100
GET BACK! GET YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.200
NO, NO!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.300
(man) YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.900
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.200
SO IN THEORY,IF YOU HADN'T STOPPED US,

27:23.200 --> 27:25.700
WE'D ALREADY KNOW THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE BABY'S MOTHER.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.500
IN FACT, WE WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU RESOLVE THE SITUATION.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.600
HEY, LADY, YOU CAN STOP TALKING, HUH? WE GET IT.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.900
YOU'VE BEEN FREE TO GO FOR 15 MINUTES.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.900

27:52.200 --> 27:53.800
COME ON, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO WILHELMINA.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.200
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.400
(Claire) JUST DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.500
THAT WOMAN WON'T GIVE UP ANYTHING UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON HER.

28:14.600 --> 28:17.100
WILHELMINA, WE ARE IN FRONT OF A D.N.A. FACILITY.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.500
WHAT HARM COULD IT POSSIBLY DO?

28:18.500 --> 28:21.200
I AM NOT GONNA INDULGE THE LUNATIC WHO TOOK MY SON

28:21.200 --> 28:22.500
JUST TO GIVE HER PEACE OF MIND.

28:22.500 --> 28:26.500
I KNOW.
I-I'M JUST SAYING,THEN WE'D BE DONE WITH THIS WHOLE UGLY SITUATION.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.600
WE COULD PUT IT BEHIND US.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.900
I TOOK THE TEST ALREADY.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.500
IT PROVED THAT HE WAS MY SON.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.300
I KNOW.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.800
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS,

28:32.800 --> 28:34.200
I SHOULD SUBMIT TO ANOTHER ONE?

28:34.800 --> 28:36.800
LOOK, DANIEL,SHE STOLE MY SON.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.500
LORD KNOWS WHERE SHE COULD'VE TAKEN HIM.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.100
AND YOU WANT ME TO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR HER?

28:41.500 --> 28:44.400
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,SHE CAN ROT IN JAIL.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.800
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.600
WE'RE IN HANDCUFFS IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR, BETTY.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.200
I THINK WE MIGHT BE OUT OF OPTIONS.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.000
NO, WE'RE NOT.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.700
WE COULD GET A COURT ORDER OR... SOMETHING.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.400
WE CAN MAKE THIS RIGHT.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.200
I DON'T KNOw WHAT I WAS THINKING...

29:03.600 --> 29:05.300
TAKING ON WILHELMINA SLATER.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.700
I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.400
CHRISTINA...

29:11.200 --> 29:12.900
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,BETTY.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.300
I JUST WANTED HIM TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.600
THAT'S ALL.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.500
(man) MA'AM, WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.200
I MADE A FEW MORE BOTTLES,AND THEY'RE IN THE REFRIGERATOR,

29:51.200 --> 29:53.600
AND THE NANNY SHOULD BE HERE AT 7:00 TO TAKE OVER.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.600
THANK YOU, MARC.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.700
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

30:04.000 --> 30:04.800
N-NO.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.700
UM, JUST...

30:08.600 --> 30:09.900
CONGRATULATIONS, I GUESS.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.400
YOU DID IT.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.200
AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS,THE BABY IS YOURS.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.100
THE BABY IS MINE, MARC.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.100
OF COURSE HE IS. UM...

30:19.800 --> 30:21.700
AND YOUR POSITION AT THE COMPANY IS SECURE.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.800
AND CHRISTINA IS GOING TO JAIL.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.300
WIN-WIN.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.000
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.600
WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT? 

30:32.700 --> 30:34.400
I...

30:38.200 --> 30:39.700
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,WILHELMINA.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.500
GOOD NIGHT, MARC.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.400
I'M SORRY, HILDA.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.000
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT THEM HERE.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.500
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.600
MM. IT'S JUST A GOOD THING THAT ARCHIE DIDN'T FIND OUT.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.800
IF HE THOUGHT THAT YOU BROUGHT A KIDNAPPED BABY HERE WITH A NEWS CREW

31:22.800 --> 31:24.100
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND...

31:25.100 --> 31:27.600
(laughs) HE WOULD BE SO, SO--

31:27.600 --> 31:29.700
I WOULD BE SO... WHAT?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.400
CUTE.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.500
DID YOU CHANGE TIES?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.300
BECAUSE IT IS--IT IS CUTE.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.100
IT IS WORKING FOR ME.SEXY. I LIKE IT.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.700
HILDA, I KNOW.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.500
(scoffs) CONCEITED!

31:44.800 --> 31:45.800
BUT STILL CUTE.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.200
JUSTIN TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.800
(chuckles) HE'S ALWAYS MAKING UP STORIES.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.700
HE'S VERY CREATIVE.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.200
HILDA, STOP. LOOK, SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, ARCHIE.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.300
IT WAS ME. IT WAS MY FAULT.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.300
I WASN'T TRYING TO ENDANGER YOUR CAMPAIGN.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.300
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP MY FRIEND.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.800
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.900
I THINK THAT'S NOBLE.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.100
WHAT? YOU WERE STRESSING ABOUT WHAT DRESS I WAS GONNA WEAR,

32:07.100 --> 32:08.600
BUT NOW YOU'RE OKAY WITH KIDNAPPING?

32:08.600 --> 32:12.300
OKAY, OKAY, TO BE CLEAR, AS CANDIDATE FOR QUEENS BOROUGH PRESIDENT,

32:12.300 --> 32:15.700
I AM NOT OKAY WITH KIDNAPPING, BUT...

32:16.200 --> 32:17.400
AS YOUR FRIEND,

32:17.400 --> 32:19.400
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

32:20.200 --> 32:24.200
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT'S RIGHT,BECAUSE WILHELMINA WON.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.400
DID YOU TRY FIGHTING DIRTY?

32:28.700 --> 32:29.700
EXCUSE ME?

32:29.800 --> 32:30.800
WELL, I'M--I'M JUST SAYING,

32:30.800 --> 32:32.500
WE ALL WANT TO PLAY BY THE RULES,

32:32.500 --> 32:35.300
BUT SOMETHING I'VE LEARNED IN CITY POLITICS IS,

32:37.100 --> 32:41.400
WELL, TO GET WHAT YOU WANT, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT TO BE A LITTLE... CREATIVE.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.600
I KNOW THE TRUTH.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.000
AND, UH, WHAT TRUTH DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW?

33:07.300 --> 33:09.100
THAT BABY DOESN'T BELONG WITH YOU.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.400
AND THAT AUBERGINE FAUX FUR DOESN'T BELONG WITH ANYTHING.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.200
YET HERE WE ARE.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.100
I CAN PROVE IT.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.500
YOU SEE THIS? THIS STAIN IS THE BABY'S SPIT-UP.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.100
AND WHEN I GET IT TESTED, IT'S GONNA PROVE THAT THE BABY IS CHRISTINA'S,

33:25.100 --> 33:27.000
AND YOU WILL GO TO JAIL.

33:27.800 --> 33:28.600
OR...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.800
YOU CAN ADMIT THAT THE BABY ISN'T YOURS,

33:32.300 --> 33:35.800
AND WE CAN CHALK UP THAT FAKE D.N.A. TEST TO A MISTAKE.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.700
YOUR CHOICE.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.200
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT ME.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.400
YES.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.400
YES, I DO.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.300
SO WE SHOULD GIVE THAT ENCHANTING POLY-BLEND THING TO YOUR LAB?

34:00.300 --> 34:04.300
AND WHEN THE D.N.A. RESULTS COME BACK AND THEY SAY STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE,

34:05.000 --> 34:05.900
THEN WHAT? 

34:10.100 --> 34:13.400
BABY SPIT-UP AND MILKSHAKE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLORS.

34:13.699 --> 34:14.500
OH, COME ON, BETTY.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.699
I'M A FASHION EXPERT.

34:15.699 --> 34:16.800
I NOTICE EVERYTHING.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.600
IT'S A GIFT AND A CURSE.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.100
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.199
I DON'T HAVE D.N.A. EVIDENCE.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.100
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.699
I DON'T HAVE YOUR MONEY, AND I DON'T HAVE YOUR POWER,

34:27.699 --> 34:31.500
BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH, AND I WILL FIGHT UNTIL IT COMES OUT.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
WILHELMINA, EVEN YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO LIE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.000
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH NOW.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.100
WHEN I DISCOVERED THE ERROR IN THE D.N.A. TEST,

34:56.100 --> 35:00.100
I WAS DEVASTATED, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.400
BECAUSE WHILE I KNEW I'D BE LOSING MY BABY,

35:03.700 --> 35:08.600
THERE WAS SIMPLY NO WAY I COULD KEEP A CHILD FROM HIS REAL MOTHER.

35:09.700 --> 35:11.200
IN A FINAL TWIST, IT TURNS OUT 

35:11.200 --> 35:14.100
THE BABY APPEARS NOT TO BE THE SCION OF BRADFORD MEADE

35:14.100 --> 35:15.400
AND WILHELMINA SLATER--

35:15.600 --> 35:19.100
BOO-HOO--BUT RATHER SOME KID FROM A COUPLE OF SCOTTISH PEOPLE.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.500
NOW GIVEN THIS NEW INFORMATION, WE'VE HAD TO REVISE OUR PREVIOUS DEPICTION

35:23.500 --> 35:25.400
OF WHAT THE BABY WOULD LOOK LIKE AT 20.

35:27.000 --> 35:27.800
DEAR LORD.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.900
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS A SHAME THAT THIS KIDNAPPING STORY

35:31.900 --> 35:33.900
HAS COME TO SUCH A TRAGIC CONCLUSION.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE WILHELMINA TOLD THE TRUTH.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
YES, THE WOMAN'S A SAINT.

35:40.400 --> 35:44.000
OH, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT HER SHARES IN THE COMPANY ARE LITTLE WILLIAM'S,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.200
AND WITHOUT THE BABY, SHE'S GOT NOTHING.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.200
AND I DON'T CARE HOW TALENTED SHE IS.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.400
YOU KEEP A COBRA AROUND LONG ENOUGH, EVENTUALLY THEY BITE.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.200
MOM'S RIGHT.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.300
WILHELMINA'S PROVEN TIME AND AGAIN SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.100
LET ME FIRE HER.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.100
NO. I'M GONNA DO IT.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.300
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.100
FINE.

35:59.100 --> 36:00.600
BUT I WANT TO SEE TEARS.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.800
MR. HARTLEY BEFORE WE SIGN THE PAPERWORK,

36:04.800 --> 36:07.000
THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.500
WILHELMINA, AHEM, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU?

36:10.700 --> 36:11.600
YOU'RE FIRED.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.600
UH, I'M SORRY.I COULDN'T HELP IT.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.600
SERIOUSLY?

36:15.600 --> 36:17.400
YOUR TIME AT MEADE IS OVER.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.000
WELL, THAT IS A SHAME.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.400
LET'S GO, GUYS.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.500
WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.500
IF YOU'RE GONNA FIRE WILHELMINA, I'M OUT.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.300
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MR. HARTLEY,

36:28.300 --> 36:30.600
THIS IS AN INTERNAL PERSONNEL MATTER.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.100
BUT I HAVE AN OPINION.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.500
I THOUGHT WE AGREED YOU'D BE A SILENT PARTNER.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.100
WELL, YOU'LL FIND THAT SOMETIMES I'M NOT SO SILENT.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.900
SHE'S A SHARK.SHE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

36:39.900 --> 36:43.000
SON, I THINK A SHARK IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED

36:43.000 --> 36:44.700
TO BALANCE THINGS OUT AROUND HERE.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.900
LOOK, YOU'RE A STAND-UP GUY, DANIEL,

36:47.900 --> 36:49.100
AND THAT'S GREAT,

36:50.100 --> 36:53.800
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU HOPPING OFF TO YOUR BUNNY HOLE EVERY TIME A PROBLEM COMES UP.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.900
I OWN COMPANIES IN COLOMBIA,INDIA, BRAZIL.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.900
IF I STOPPED DOING BUSINESS EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GOT KIDNAPPED,

36:59.900 --> 37:01.500
I'D NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.500
SO EITHER MS. SLATER KEEPS HER STAKE IN THE COMPANY

37:05.500 --> 37:08.800
AND HER JOB,OR I WALK.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.300
PLEASURE. CLAIRE.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.200
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.200
(man) GOOD. FOR YOU.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.900
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.400
OKAY, NEVER MIND.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.600
(sighs) GLAD TO SEE YOU,BETTY.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.000
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO THANK YOU.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
WHAT FOR?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
FOR THE PLUCKY LITTLE THREAT YOU MADE.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.400
YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.100
THE TRUTH ALWAYS COMES OUT.

37:58.800 --> 38:02.000
AND WHEN YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER NOT TO HAVE TO LIE

38:02.000 --> 38:03.700
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

38:03.700 --> 38:05.200
I TOOK THAT QUITE TO HEART.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.600
IF YOU'RE GOING TO INVEST IN THIS COMPANY,

38:07.600 --> 38:09.600
I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ME.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.500
WHAT IS THAT?

38:10.500 --> 38:14.500
I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO STOLE A DEAD MAN'S SPERM,

38:14.500 --> 38:18.500
WHO FALSIFIED D.N.A. RESULTS,WHO KEPT A MOTHER IN THE DARK

38:18.700 --> 38:21.800
JUST TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION THAT HER BABY WAS MINE--

38:21.900 --> 38:25.900
ALL OF THIS TO ENSURE MY PLACE IN THIS COMPANY.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.700
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL THIS?

38:27.900 --> 38:30.200
BECAUSE I'M SOMEONE YOU NEED ON YOUR SIDE,

38:30.200 --> 38:34.200
WORKING FOR YOU AS OPPOSED TO AN ENEMY...

38:35.300 --> 38:36.500
WORKING AGAINST YOU.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.700
YOU ENCOURAGED ME TO TELL THE TRUTH,

38:40.700 --> 38:43.100
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, HARTLEY DECIDED TO KEEP ME ON.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.400
SO THANK YOU AGAIN.

38:45.100 --> 38:48.500
OH, AND WHEN CHRISTINA COMES BACK, WOULD YOU BE A DEAR AND BRING THE BABY TO HER?

38:49.100 --> 38:52.100
I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF SHE AND I DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.500
BRAVO, WILHEL-MAESTRO.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.100
BRAVO.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.400
WHO'S THAT?

39:24.600 --> 39:25.800
IT'S YOUR MOMMY.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.600
(whispers) HELLO.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.800
THERE'S MOMMY.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.600
AND I'M YOUR DADDY.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.100
YES, YES.
HEY, LITTLE GUY.

39:31.700 --> 39:32.700
HEY.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.400
BETTY...

39:34.700 --> 39:38.400
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.300
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE YOU FIRST GOT TO "MODE."

39:42.500 --> 39:45.600
I MEAN, YOU STILL DRESS THE SAME, BUT STILL, A LONG WAY.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.100
IT'S BEEN REALLY LOVELY KNOWING YOU AS A FRIEND. I MEAN THAT.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.900
CHRISTINA, STOP. WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE YOU'RE GOING AWAY?

40:01.400 --> 40:02.200
CHRISTINA...

40:03.500 --> 40:06.000
STUART AND I ARE GONNA GO BACK TO SCOTLAND.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.300
WHAT?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.400
WHY?

40:10.400 --> 40:14.300
WE WANT TO BE CLOSER TO OUR FAMILIES SO THE WEE ONE CAN GET TO KNOW THEM.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.600
PLUS, I DON'T WANT HIM SPEAKING LIKE A YANK,

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
'CAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU PEOPLE SAY. (chuckles)

40:19.300 --> 40:20.600
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAREER?

40:20.600 --> 40:22.000
WHAT ABOUT DESIGNING?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.800
WHAT, YOU THINK THEY DON'T HAVE DESIGNERS IN EDINBURGH?

40:24.900 --> 40:26.900
LISTEN, I'VE NOT GIVEN UP ON MY DREAM.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.800
THAT WAS SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM A VERY GOOD FRIEND.

40:33.800 --> 40:34.700
COME HERE.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.800
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.600
I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.
