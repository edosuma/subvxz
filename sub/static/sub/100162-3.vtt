It's the start of the weekend and, even
more importantly, the start of half-term.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.280

you lot have a job to do tomorrow morning.

Where I grew up, not far from here,

10:15.080 --> 10:17.240
if we wanted to buy groceries,

10:17.320 --> 10:19.080
bread and butter and eggs,

10:19.160 --> 10:20.960
we'd go to the local shop.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.880
If we wanted fresh vegetables,

10:22.960 --> 10:26.440
we'd have to go to the open market
in central Huddersfield.

that wasn't in a tin,

one more appointment to confirm today.

for Sir Leslie Fry.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.440
At about eight o'clock this morning,

13:22.520 --> 13:24.800
the local branch
of the National Coal Board

13:24.880 --> 13:26.000
received a report

13:26.600 --> 13:30.080
that a depression had formed
in tip number seven.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.840
-Meaning?
-Uh, it had sunk.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.920
What's it doing sinking like that?
Isn't it solid?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.160
[Marcia] Apparently not.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.440
Not with all the heavy rainfall
that they've been having lately.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.760
It seems... that all that water

13:43.840 --> 13:47.760
turned enough of the coal waste
inside the tip into slurry

13:47.840 --> 13:49.280
to cause the sinkhole.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.240
And then about a quarter past nine,

13:51.320 --> 13:53.840
that liquid waste broke free of the tip,

13:53.920 --> 13:56.160
slid down the mountain
towards the village.

13:56.920 --> 14:01.080
Pantglas Junior School bore the brunt
of it; several houses, too.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.800
And how much coal was in this tip?

14:03.880 --> 14:04.880
Too much.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.800
Three hundred thousand cubic yards.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.440
Plus, guidelines suggest

14:10.520 --> 14:12.880
that tips should be no higher
than 20 feet tall.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.320
Now, this one was over five times that.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.320
Who from the Coal Board is there?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.800
The local supervisor, Eric Ellis.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.120
We're gonna need someone
higher up than that.

head of the Coal Board?

14:30.960 --> 14:32.920
as Chancellor of Surrey University today

14:33.000 --> 14:35.280
and saw no reason
to postpone the investiture.

by unprecedented rainfall.

18:09.120 --> 18:13.120
will be given to those in charge
to take whatever action they need.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
[reporters shout questions]

18:17.680 --> 18:20.280
[reporter] Any other tips
that are a danger to the public?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.760
I have no intention

18:22.840 --> 18:25.080
of adding to anything
I've made in my statement.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.440
[man] It's a bit late now!

18:28.640 --> 18:31.800
We've been telling everyone for years
those tips were dangerous.

18:38.760 --> 18:42.360
[woman] It was a disaster
waiting to happen, and no one listened.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.560
[radio] The number of casualties
in the tip disaster in South Wales

18:46.640 --> 18:47.960
could be as high as 200.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.440
Thirty-six people remain in hospital,
20 bodies have been recovered,

18:51.520 --> 18:55.840
and estimates suggest that as many
as 150 more are still missing,

18:55.920 --> 18:57.320
most of them children.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.920
-What are you doing?
-You haven't heard the news?

19:10.000 --> 19:14.080
No. I-I-I've been at...
Caroline's birthday party.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.560
When you read the papers tomorrow,
you'll understand.

19:16.640 --> 19:17.640
But...

19:22.880 --> 19:24.080
[Wilson sighs]

19:48.120 --> 19:49.200
[breathing heavily]

19:57.440 --> 20:01.360
[radio] Smoke continues to hamper rescue
efforts tonight in the village of Aberfan,

20:01.440 --> 20:02.440
South Wales.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.320
So far, 67 bodies, mostly children,

20:05.400 --> 20:08.760
have been pulled from the wreckage
of Pantglas Junior School,

20:08.840 --> 20:11.880
which was struck by coal waste
from a nearby tip.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.400
Hope remains for many more still missing,

20:14.480 --> 20:17.800
but work to recover bodies
is likely to continue through the night.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.800
The Prime Minister, Harold Wilson,
visited the scene today,

20:20.880 --> 20:24.400
and Buckingham Palace have issued
a statement of sorrow from the Queen.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.960
The message reads,
"I am shocked and distressed

20:27.040 --> 20:30.720
to learn of the terrible disaster
which has taken place at Aberfan.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.440
Please convey a message
of my heartfelt sympathy

20:33.520 --> 20:36.360
from my husband and myself
to the children's parents

20:36.440 --> 20:39.200
and to the families
of those who have lost their lives."

20:39.840 --> 20:43.000
That's the news from us at the moment.
Now back to London.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.080
There will be special reports
during the...

21:03.480 --> 21:05.480
[footsteps approach]

21:10.920 --> 21:12.240
Prime Minister, ma'am.

21:14.040 --> 21:18.200
As of an hour ago, the loss of life
in Aberfan stands at 116.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.720
Now, it appears
that over 80 are still missing.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.760
Thirty-six of the survivors
have been hospitalized.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.040
[Elizabeth] I see.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.000
Are any more victims expected to be found?

21:28.520 --> 21:30.200
[Wilson] Uh, not alive, ma'am.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.480
To make matters worse,

21:31.560 --> 21:34.440
it has been reported that
the north shoulder of tip seven has moved

21:34.520 --> 21:36.960
and the village is ready
for immediate evacuation.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.040
Mechanical diggers are out of action,

21:39.160 --> 21:41.600
bogged down in the soggy mud.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.760
The military have been brought in to help.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.320
Now...

21:47.040 --> 21:48.920
given all this,

21:49.400 --> 21:51.640
I was hoping I might persuade you to go.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.800
One of the most unfortunate things
about being sovereign I have discovered

21:59.880 --> 22:03.520
is that you paralyze
virtually any situation you walk into.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.840
The very last thing
emergency and rescue services need

22:06.920 --> 22:10.000
when they are working against the clock
is a queen turning up.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.720
I'm not sure I agree.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.960
Children have died.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.600
A community is devastated.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.880
What precisely would you have me do?

22:32.360 --> 22:33.640
Well, comfort people.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.320
Put on a show?

22:36.960 --> 22:38.280
The Crown doesn't do that.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.160
I didn't say put on a show.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.600
I said comfort people.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.680
-[presses button]
-[bell rings]

23:02.360 --> 23:03.440
Your Majesty.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.480
[door opens]

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
[door closes]

23:30.040 --> 23:32.040
[clock chimes]

23:40.000 --> 23:41.760
[Queen Mother] Morning, darling. Tea?

23:41.840 --> 23:44.400
[Margaret] Anyone object
if I had something stronger?

23:44.560 --> 23:47.640
-Coffee?
-No, I was thinking whiskey.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.240
-Margaret, it's nine o'clock.
-Yes, I know.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.400
But it's not morning.
Not in my world, anyway.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.600
Tony called in the small hours,

23:59.080 --> 24:02.440
from a call box
in the middle of nowhere.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.520
-[phone line beeps]
-[coins clatter]

24:07.280 --> 24:08.360
Hello, it's me.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.120
Can you do something for me?

24:13.240 --> 24:15.680
[Margaret] He told me to go
into the children's bedrooms

24:16.240 --> 24:17.360
and kiss them

24:18.640 --> 24:19.800
while they slept.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.480
As soon as he got to Aberfan,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.800
he went straight to the school.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.640
It was... unimaginably awful.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.400
Miners,

24:44.040 --> 24:45.840
used to digging for coal,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.480
now digging to reach their children.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.920
[Tony]
Many of them spent several hours

24:56.000 --> 24:58.240
stuck under the mud beside dead friends.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.400
[Margaret] Buried alive.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.520
Running out of air.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.280
He then went to the mortuary,

25:07.000 --> 25:11.240
where people were waiting
to identify the children's bodies.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.800
Nurses and Salvation Army volunteers,

25:14.880 --> 25:19.400
they were writing a description
of each adult, each child.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.680
Noting any possessions they found

25:23.760 --> 25:25.760
in their pockets, like, like, uh...

25:26.600 --> 25:27.760
a handkerchief or...

25:28.360 --> 25:30.080
sweets, anything,

25:30.920 --> 25:32.480
to help identify them.

25:36.680 --> 25:38.680
[sobbing]

25:45.520 --> 25:48.320
[Tony]
And from there I went to the hospital.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.640
[Margaret] There he comforted a man

25:52.280 --> 25:54.720
who was holding his son's school cap.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.240
After the hospital,

25:58.320 --> 26:01.480
he wanted to walk back to the house
where he was due to stay,

26:02.400 --> 26:03.840
but he carried on walking...

26:06.760 --> 26:08.120
and walking.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.400
I walked and walked and walked.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.800
No, I've never heard him like that.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.400
I hope I never do again.

26:39.320 --> 26:42.440
[councilor] We have Geoffrey Morgan
from the National Coal Board

26:42.520 --> 26:44.160
and George Thomas,

26:44.240 --> 26:47.080
Minister of State for Wales,
here to answer our questions.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.880
Will you both accept responsibility?

26:49.960 --> 26:51.120
Murderers!

26:52.080 --> 26:55.720
The National Coal Board cannot
accept responsibility for the weather!

26:55.800 --> 26:56.800
[man] Rubbish!

26:56.880 --> 27:01.840
[Morgan] Abnormal levels of rainfall
have created extraordinary conditions.

27:01.960 --> 27:05.560
You've known about the spring
under the tip for years!

27:05.640 --> 27:07.920
-I wrote to you!
-So did I!

27:08.520 --> 27:10.800
That's what's caused this, not rainfall!

27:10.880 --> 27:12.400
[woman] And nothing was done!

27:12.480 --> 27:15.760
"Buried alive
by the National Coal Board."

27:16.280 --> 27:19.320
That's what I want to see written
on my child's death certificate!

27:19.400 --> 27:20.440
[shouting]

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
[woman] What about financial assistance?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.080
We've got people in dire need now!

27:26.840 --> 27:30.160
When's government going to step in? When?

27:30.720 --> 27:33.000
Let us be quite clear.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.240
A dreadful tragedy has taken place.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.800
But blame for that

27:39.880 --> 27:42.640
cannot be placed at the door
of the Labour Party.

27:42.720 --> 27:48.160
Tip number seven was built in 1958
when the Labour Party wasn't in power.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.040
[shouting]

27:50.120 --> 27:53.720
I had a visit today
from certain members of the Cabinet.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.480
No need to tell me who.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.200
Who are concerned
that this is all turning political.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.400
[Wilson] Of course it's turning political.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.520
[Marcia] And they want you to do something
to deflect the blame.

28:05.880 --> 28:10.080
Their view is if the Labour government
pay the price for this tragedy,

28:10.160 --> 28:13.640
and the Tories make political capital
from it, it would be obscene

28:13.720 --> 28:14.920
and a betrayal,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.120
not just of the people of South Wales,

28:17.200 --> 28:19.240
but of all of us in the movement.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.840
We've been waiting for this
for too long, Harold.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.680
Thirteen years in opposition,

28:24.760 --> 28:27.640
and now we're finally in power,
in government.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.480
We cannot allow ourselves

28:29.600 --> 28:32.240
to be crucified
on the altar of public opinion

28:32.320 --> 28:34.320
over something that isn't our fault.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.360
Hmm, when people are angry,
they throw stones at their leaders.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.080
Then it's a duty
not just to deflect that anger,

28:41.160 --> 28:43.640
but to show solidarity
with our supporters.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
How?

28:45.360 --> 28:48.200
-This is grief, Marcia.
-It's injustice.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.760
It's just another
in a long list of injustices.

28:50.840 --> 28:53.000
No, it's parents grieving their children.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.320
It's also cold-hearted refusal
to accept responsibility

28:57.400 --> 29:00.680
by the people who are to blame,
the Tories.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.800
And now they're making us the scapegoats.

29:02.880 --> 29:05.520
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
[lighter clicks]

29:06.680 --> 29:08.920
[Marcia] Make sure they take the blame!

29:09.000 --> 29:12.840
And if you can't blame it on the Tories,
and you won't press it in the House,

29:12.920 --> 29:15.800
and you can't go after the NCB
until the tribunal is over,

29:15.880 --> 29:21.280
then perhaps we should look
for another establishment figure

29:21.360 --> 29:23.280
to deflect negative attention.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.720
Who?

29:26.960 --> 29:29.760
-[Marcia] Her!
-The Queen?

29:30.600 --> 29:33.640
Well, you must admit
her behavior is symptomatic

29:33.720 --> 29:35.360
of establishment neglect.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.760
Her behavior is unfortunate.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.960
-You went to see her today, didn't you?
-Yes.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
[Marcia] And you asked her again to go?

29:44.600 --> 29:45.680
Yes.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.000
[Marcia] And what did she say?

29:48.080 --> 29:50.080
"The Crown doesn't go."

29:51.000 --> 29:52.680
[Wilson] Something like that.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.320
The Duke of Edinburgh is now going.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.560
They pulled him away
from some duck shoot.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.080
Yes, but she isn't?

30:00.600 --> 30:03.040
Perhaps there's good reason for that.

30:03.120 --> 30:06.600
Maybe she finds that kind
of situation difficult.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.320
Losing your children is difficult!

30:11.520 --> 30:14.640
Losing brothers and sisters is difficult!

30:15.640 --> 30:19.920
Living in a mining village where
the Coal Board abandons you is difficult!

30:20.000 --> 30:21.640
And instead of sticking the knife in her

30:21.720 --> 30:24.840
and allowing us all to vent our anger
at someone cold-hearted,

30:24.920 --> 30:27.200
you'd sooner let your own team
take the blame!

30:27.280 --> 30:29.560
You're pathetic! You disgust me!

30:29.640 --> 30:30.800
So you keep telling me.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.360
If you ever want to be a real leader,

30:33.440 --> 30:36.320
a real man, a real socialist,

30:36.400 --> 30:38.400
you're going to have to grow some balls!

30:41.120 --> 30:45.720
[TV] The NCB is a creation
of the Labour Party.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.280
[crowd cheers]

30:48.360 --> 30:52.320
This is a government-made disaster!

30:52.400 --> 30:53.640
[cheering]

30:53.720 --> 30:55.360
Take responsibility!

31:17.280 --> 31:20.120
-Is this the school just here?
-This is the school, yes.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.320
[sighs]

31:44.760 --> 31:46.520
[church bell rings]

31:46.600 --> 31:49.920
[bishop] And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.920
And there shall be no more death.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.680
Neither sorrow nor crying.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.240
Neither shall there be any more pain.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.840
For the former things are passed away.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.240
[church bell rings]

32:10.800 --> 32:13.560
Fear not, for I am with thee.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.160
He shall feed His flock like a shepherd.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.920
He shall gather the lambs with His arms

32:20.800 --> 32:22.440
and carry them in His bosom

32:23.160 --> 32:26.280
and shall gently lead
those that are with young.

32:27.080 --> 32:30.280
And the streets of the city
shall be full of boys and girls

32:30.360 --> 32:32.160
playing in the streets thereof.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.960
"And they shall be mine,"
said the Lord of Hosts.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.920
In that day when I make up my jewels.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.360
And I will spare them,

32:44.080 --> 32:47.360
as a man spareth his own son
that serveth him.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.840
I saw four angels standing
on the four corners of the Earth.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.200
I heard a voice from Heaven.

at the government,
at the Coal Board, but...

Did I weep?

What kind of question is that?

35:50.320 --> 35:52.040
Just a question. Did you weep?

35:54.440 --> 35:55.800
I might have wept, yes.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.720
Are you going to tell me
it was inappropriate?

35:59.920 --> 36:04.480
And the fact is
anyone who heard that hymn today

would not just have wept...

[Adeane] We've had a tip-off
from a friendly newspaper editor

36:51.960 --> 36:53.400
that the government,

36:53.480 --> 36:56.120
determined not to take the blame
for Aberfan,

36:56.520 --> 37:01.240
have decided to refocus the subject
of the national conversation

37:02.560 --> 37:05.800
and has briefed newspapers that...

37:07.960 --> 37:11.040
"One person has been conspicuously
absent from Aberfan,

37:11.120 --> 37:12.200
and that is our Queen.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.840
The scandalous lack of care and interest,

37:15.920 --> 37:18.880
one can only assume it is that,
by our head of state

37:19.840 --> 37:23.200
is symptomatic of a lack of care
from the traditional establishment,

37:23.280 --> 37:27.800
not just for the people of Wales,
but for the whole working class."

37:36.560 --> 37:38.840
And the Prime Minister gave that
his blessing?

37:40.600 --> 37:43.080
Well, I think we have to assume so.

38:15.920 --> 38:20.040
[Charteris] On arrival at RAF St. Athan,
you will be received

Then on to the Bethania Chapel

38:30.560 --> 38:34.520
for the presentation of the heroes
and survivors of the disaster.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.360
There will then be a visit
to the cemetery,

38:37.440 --> 38:38.840
where you will lay a wreath.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.520
And finally,
a visit to the home of a local miner,

38:42.600 --> 38:45.960
Thomas Edwards,
who lost relatives in the disaster

38:46.040 --> 38:49.800

Without wishing to prompt,
Your Majesty,

38:58.320 --> 39:02.240
you may wish to consider
that this is Wales, not England.

39:02.760 --> 39:06.760
A display of emotion would not just
be considered appropriate,

Churchill would have had the character

Come to think of it,
so would Anthony Eden.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.160
And Harold Macmillan.

45:12.080 --> 45:16.320
Each of them would have had the courage
to express their anger to me directly.

45:16.400 --> 45:20.560
None of them would ever have resorted
to going behind my back like that.

45:23.440 --> 45:26.400
I have it on authority
you tipped off journalists

45:26.480 --> 45:29.360
that I was letting the side down
by not going to Aberfan.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.600
-Never.
-It wasn't you?

45:32.680 --> 45:33.760
No, ma'am.

But... perhaps one or two
of my colleagues,

45:41.160 --> 45:43.880
concerned at the anger
being directed at the government--

45:43.960 --> 45:47.360

Took matters into their own hands?

45:51.160 --> 45:52.160
It's possible.

46:04.040 --> 46:05.360
Perhaps they're right.

46:06.840 --> 46:09.320
The people of Aberfan deserved
a prompt response.

46:09.480 --> 46:10.720
They didn't get one.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.640
They deserved a display of compassion,

46:13.720 --> 46:15.480
of empathy from their Queen.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.880
And they got it yesterday.

They got nothing.

whom I loved very much,

when she died...

47:02.120 --> 47:03.160
nothing.

Well, she had been ill a long time.
It had been expected.

a moment of such significance
for every mother...

there is something wrong with me.

in my life.

I am an academic,
a privileged Oxford don,

47:57.280 --> 47:58.440
not a worker.

47:59.920 --> 48:03.320
I don't like beer. I prefer brandy.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.920
I prefer wild salmon to tinned salmon.

48:07.920 --> 48:10.560
Chateaubriand to steak and kidney pie.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.960
And I don't like pipe smoking.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.520
I far prefer cigars.

48:19.480 --> 48:23.320
But cigars are a symbol
of capitalist privilege.

So, I smoke a pipe,

We can't be everything to everyone

We do what we have to do as leaders.
That's our job.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.920
Our job is to calm more crises
than we create.

and you do it very well indeed.

your absence of emotion is a blessing.

No one needs hysteria
from a head of state.
