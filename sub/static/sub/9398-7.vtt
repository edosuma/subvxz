WEBVTT

00:00.694 --> 00:02.259
You just became a Raven.

00:02.269 --> 00:04.123
I'm having money problems, dad.

00:04.133 --> 00:05.144
I need your help.

00:05.154 --> 00:07.114
Right now, you're not an
investment I'm interested in.

00:07.144 --> 00:09.444
I am the majority
owner of Tric...

00:09.454 --> 00:11.705
which means you can
get the hell out.

00:11.715 --> 00:14.695
Take your seats. I'm your new
english teacher -- Mr. Chavez.

00:14.762 --> 00:15.850
Nick?

00:15.913 --> 00:17.717
We really can't do this, right?

00:17.726 --> 00:20.050
I'm not leaving here till
I get my damn pills.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.836
It's either the pills or me.

00:25.273 --> 00:26.969
Leave me alone!

00:32.052 --> 00:34.480
- Who are you?
- Guess I'm your brother.

00:34.519 --> 00:36.603
I know that was a lot of money,
but I'm gonna pay you back.

00:36.638 --> 00:37.602
Every cent.

00:37.617 --> 00:38.782
Take your time.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.257 --> 00:51.443
How you doing?

00:52.305 --> 00:53.573
He's with me.

00:53.977 --> 00:55.341
What are you doing here?!

00:55.357 --> 00:56.402
I came here to wish you luck.

00:56.438 --> 00:57.700
Somebody might see you.

00:57.716 --> 00:59.410
Oh, no one here knows me.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.230
Besides, there's nothing
wrong with a teacher coming up

01:02.246 --> 01:04.260
to check on his most
promising student --

01:04.278 --> 01:08.512
his most promising, sexy,
irresistible student.

01:08.528 --> 01:10.882
Uh, Brooke,
where do you want these?

01:13.866 --> 01:15.722
Over there's... fine.

01:15.736 --> 01:17.611
Thank you again for
helping me out today.

01:17.627 --> 01:19.432
I'd be totally lost if
it weren't for you.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.622
That's cool.
It gets me out of geography.

01:21.635 --> 01:23.642
It's a good thing you're
student-council president.

01:23.677 --> 01:25.713
So, what do you
need me to do next?

01:25.726 --> 01:27.642
Um, I need you to take
these body jewels

01:27.657 --> 01:29.020
and paste them on Tia.

01:29.035 --> 01:31.930
I want them on her neck,
her thighs, and her cleavage.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.203
Mouth.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.591
Breathe and paste.

01:39.067 --> 01:40.101
Okay.

01:52.526 --> 01:53.892
Hey, come on.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.572
Oh, hey. I'm getting that.

01:57.055 --> 01:58.371
You shouldn't be
straining yourself.

01:58.405 --> 02:00.511
You can't risk
falling and stuff.

02:00.527 --> 02:02.903
Relax. I'm pregnant,
not elderly.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.640
Oh, anyway, I'm glad you're up.

02:04.656 --> 02:05.603
Are you kidding me?

02:05.616 --> 02:08.389
The semifinal's tonight.
I could barely sleep.

02:08.406 --> 02:11.020
- I want to go to Duke with you.
- What?

02:11.036 --> 02:13.962
I got my acceptance letter from Duke,
and, um,

02:13.977 --> 02:15.861
it just made me think
about what I want.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.452
And I want to make you happy more
than anything else in the world,

02:18.485 --> 02:20.980
- so I want to go to Duke with you!
- Oh, Haley.

02:21.348 --> 02:24.041
You've been so supportive of
me and my dream for music,

02:24.055 --> 02:28.103
and I just want to be supportive of
you and your dream for playing at Duke.

02:28.116 --> 02:30.451
So I want to do
this for us, okay?

02:30.936 --> 02:32.720
How did I get so lucky?

02:32.736 --> 02:34.381
It helps that you're hot.

02:35.305 --> 02:37.263
Well... thank you.

02:37.275 --> 02:39.123
You're gonna be so happy there.

02:39.446 --> 02:42.991
I got to go 'cause I'm meeting Skills
and Lucas for an early workout.

02:43.005 --> 02:44.821
What's all this
stuff for, anyway?

02:44.837 --> 02:46.360
Babysitting.

02:46.378 --> 02:49.231
I thought the extra experience
and money couldn't hurt.

02:49.248 --> 02:51.102
Besides, I just really don't
want to be one of those moms

02:51.135 --> 02:53.522
that's, like,
completely overwhelmed and unprepared

02:53.537 --> 02:55.720
and always screaming at her
kids the way my mom used to be.

02:55.756 --> 02:57.623
Oh, it was crazy. Anyway...

02:57.636 --> 03:00.611
um, the kids are coming
by after school.

03:00.626 --> 03:03.480
And, uh... you know what --
you should stop by and say hi.

03:03.496 --> 03:06.421
Nah. I'll pass.
I don't really like kids.

03:06.665 --> 03:08.952
Uh, I'll like our kid.

03:08.966 --> 03:10.740
Yeah, get out of here, you bum.

03:20.456 --> 03:23.832
Big hands... nice.

03:26.675 --> 03:28.653
I'm so, so sorry.

03:28.668 --> 03:32.011
I'm  -- I'm just not used to
working this close to a girl --

03:32.028 --> 03:35.993
I mean, a woman who is, like...
this hot.

03:36.006 --> 03:39.463
Oh, my god.
You're so cute I could eat you!

03:39.476 --> 03:41.782
Please tell me you're a virgin.

03:42.708 --> 03:46.762
Oh ! Oh, my god!
I'm totally eating you up!

03:47.157 --> 03:49.843
I'm just gonna go
kill myself now.

03:49.857 --> 03:53.821
No, no. It's so hard 
to find cute virgin boys.

03:53.837 --> 03:56.241
All my friends would love you.

03:56.258 --> 03:57.981
We're getting together
tonight at a bar.

03:57.996 --> 03:59.800
You should totally join us.

03:59.817 --> 04:01.100
Me?

04:01.118 --> 04:03.331
Join you and your friends?

04:03.348 --> 04:06.341
Well, let's just say that
there's a pretty good chance

04:06.357 --> 04:08.773
you won't wake up
a virgin tomorrow.

04:09.718 --> 04:12.360
So, is that a "yes"?

04:51.046 --> 04:52.382
Peyton.

04:54.815 --> 04:56.633
How did you get in here?

04:56.648 --> 04:58.522
The question is,
how didn't I get in?

04:58.537 --> 05:00.051
I popped open the back door,

05:00.068 --> 05:02.682
the basement window,
and the window near the porch.

05:02.695 --> 05:06.110
Given your history, I thought you'd
pay more attention to home security.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.180
Okay, what are you doing here?

05:08.198 --> 05:10.160
I thought you weren't
interested in sticking around.

05:10.198 --> 05:11.852
I'm not. I just wanted 
to make sure you're safe

05:11.886 --> 05:13.561
before I go back to my life.

05:13.577 --> 05:15.443
Well, I slept
great last night...

05:15.457 --> 05:17.782
alone.
So mission accomplished.

05:18.535 --> 05:21.152
Is that why you haven't been
to school in over a week?

05:21.167 --> 05:23.292
A lot of seniors skip class.

05:23.307 --> 05:26.520
They skip school to do fun stuff,
not hide in their room all day,

05:26.536 --> 05:28.381
afraid to step out
onto their own porch.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.440
That's not what I'm doing.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.932
Well, if you're really over
getting attacked by that psycho,

05:31.946 --> 05:34.141
then there's no reason you
shouldn't be at school.

05:34.157 --> 05:38.122
Unless you'd rather hang out here,
not feeling sorry for yourself.

05:38.847 --> 05:41.222
Fine. If it'll get
you out of my house,

05:41.235 --> 05:42.591
I'll go to school.

05:42.606 --> 05:44.241
Fine. I'll drive you.

05:44.257 --> 05:45.642
Fine.

05:46.515 --> 05:49.031
Get moving. It's 0800.

05:49.495 --> 05:51.421
I like the other Derek better.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.282
L. Scott -- 20 in a row.
The boy is on fire.

05:57.296 --> 05:58.680
You ready for tonight?

05:59.885 --> 06:02.350
I'd feel a lot better if I had you
watching my back the whole time.

06:02.386 --> 06:05.590
I know, but I promised my mom not
a second more than 15 minutes.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.342
It ain't like it's gonna
take us half the time

06:08.358 --> 06:10.332
to beat the chumps we're
playin' tonight anyway.

06:10.347 --> 06:12.370
Then we're going to states,
so you know what that means.

06:12.408 --> 06:14.210
We're about to be V.I.P.
around here, dawg.

06:14.225 --> 06:16.941
I'm about to have all the
females getting my name tattooed

06:16.957 --> 06:19.010
all over their body.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.313
I'll be right back.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.422
Daunte. Hey, man. 

06:36.436 --> 06:38.761
Um... I don't have
your money yet.

06:38.778 --> 06:40.352
I tried to get a
loan from my mom,

06:40.368 --> 06:42.543
and it turns out she's
not doing so good.

06:42.557 --> 06:44.722
- I know it's 10 grand.
- 15.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.851
What?

06:45.867 --> 06:47.143
You don't make your
payments on time,

06:47.176 --> 06:48.573
juice keeps running
on the money.

06:48.585 --> 06:50.110
You said I could pay
you back whenever.

06:50.147 --> 06:52.673
Yeah. It goes without saying
there's a price with that.

06:52.688 --> 06:54.413
I  mean,
this is the streets, Nathan.

06:54.727 --> 06:57.022
We're not bank of Tree Hill.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.080
What am I supposed to do?

06:59.108 --> 07:01.643
I can't come up with that
kind of cash overnight.

07:01.848 --> 07:04.760
Well, I could
forget the amount.

07:05.577 --> 07:08.363
The Ravens are favored to
win by 10 points tonight.

07:08.376 --> 07:10.120
A lot of people
are betting on it.

07:10.135 --> 07:12.010
I think we're a lock to win
by a lot more than that.

07:12.043 --> 07:13.666
We're gonna blow
those guys out.

07:13.673 --> 07:16.269
Uh, not if you want
your debt to go away.

07:18.053 --> 07:20.470
Look, Nathan,
you can win the game --

07:20.489 --> 07:22.892
just don't win it by
more than nine points.

07:23.217 --> 07:24.261
No way.

07:24.275 --> 07:26.040
Nathan, I'm not
asking you to lose.

07:26.055 --> 07:28.472
The Ravens will still win and
go to the state championship.

07:28.487 --> 07:29.932
You'll be debt-free.

07:29.947 --> 07:32.400
The way I see it,
everybody wins.

07:33.865 --> 07:36.362
Look, Nathan,
I'm trying to help you out, here.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.632
Before you get
yourself in trouble,

07:38.645 --> 07:41.580
take the offer,
or have my money tonight.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.152
Do you know those guys?

07:49.165 --> 07:52.173
Not personally, but I heard
they're into a lot of bad stuff,

07:52.186 --> 07:54.611
so anything they want
with Nate can't be good.

08:40.717 --> 08:41.962
You look amazing.

08:41.977 --> 08:43.541
You look perfect...

08:43.676 --> 08:45.951
this  looks really, really good.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.380
And you look lost.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.532
The plus-size show
is next door.

08:50.546 --> 08:52.422
Very funny. Let me ask you --

08:52.437 --> 08:55.710
if I am so fat,
why am I on the cover of Maxim?

08:55.726 --> 08:56.613
What?!

08:56.626 --> 08:58.892
For the first time ever, Maxim put
a hometown hottie on the cover,

08:58.928 --> 09:00.581
and that hottie is me!

09:01.585 --> 09:03.052
Oh, my god!

09:03.067 --> 09:04.980
Okay, let's celebrate
tonight after the game.

09:04.997 --> 09:08.180
Um... oh, I can't.
I have plans tonight.

09:08.327 --> 09:11.740
Let me guess --
you're going out with Mr. Chavez.

09:12.158 --> 09:13.720
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:13.738 --> 09:16.071
Don't play dumb. I saw you sneak
out last night to meet him.

09:16.107 --> 09:17.310
You claimed it was over.

09:17.328 --> 09:19.612
And you claim
you're not a slut,

09:19.625 --> 09:21.093
and that is such a lie.

09:21.108 --> 09:22.611
I never claimed
I wasn't a slut.

09:22.626 --> 09:25.242
You know, you need to worry
less about my love life

09:25.258 --> 09:28.203
and more about your own with,
like, every guy in America,

09:28.216 --> 09:30.561
because you are so
hot in this spread!

09:30.576 --> 09:31.992
I know.

10:13.016 --> 10:15.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Peyton, what's wrong?

10:15.906 --> 10:17.732
Oh, come on.

10:17.766 --> 10:19.520
Let's get you home.

10:21.648 --> 10:23.150
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.851
My back problems
just won't let up.

10:26.175 --> 10:28.451
Perhaps physical
therapy could help.

10:28.468 --> 10:31.143
Or those, um, those pills 
you gave me the last time.

10:31.158 --> 10:33.092
They fixed me right up.

10:33.996 --> 10:35.630
To be honest with you, Deb,

10:35.646 --> 10:39.092
I am not comfortable
prescribing you more medication.

10:39.896 --> 10:42.232
Okay, this is awkward. Um...

10:42.626 --> 10:46.163
I guess we both know I don't
actually have back problems.

10:46.176 --> 10:49.843
My issues are far
more complicated.

10:50.758 --> 10:53.843
I've lost my son, my husband,

10:53.855 --> 10:57.193
and I've realized that
without my family --

10:57.386 --> 10:59.922
dysfunctional as it was --

11:00.088 --> 11:01.893
I'm a failure.

11:02.217 --> 11:06.173
Deb, I'm sure these pills
are making you feel better,

11:06.185 --> 11:08.211
but they are not the answer.

11:08.226 --> 11:11.940
You need to get your life in order,
starting with therapy.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.243
You're right.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.080
I will make the
appointment for you.

11:39.295 --> 11:41.650
Okay, everyone, settle down.

11:43.088 --> 11:44.513
People!

11:45.207 --> 11:48.763
Magazines aren't
allowed in class.

11:48.775 --> 11:52.201
And, you,
stop making a spectacle of yourself.

11:52.218 --> 11:54.350
What's the matter, Mr. Chavez?

11:54.378 --> 11:56.933
I thought you liked
high-school girls.

11:57.865 --> 12:00.071
After school, miss Gatina.

12:03.816 --> 12:07.640
And next, we presents the latest
line from Hoes Over Broes

12:07.657 --> 12:10.160
by designer Brooke Davis.

12:11.866 --> 12:13.272
Mouthy...

12:13.777 --> 12:16.412
can you come over here and
help me put on my shoe?

12:16.426 --> 12:18.302
I don't want to chip my nails.

12:29.706 --> 12:31.102
Thanks.

12:39.705 --> 12:42.243
Now I know why they
call you "Mouth."

12:42.258 --> 12:44.940
By the way,
I'm really excited for tonight.

12:53.965 --> 12:55.121
Hey, you.

12:55.137 --> 12:57.213
I heard you're helping
out with Brooke's show.

12:57.227 --> 13:00.292
Yeah. Uh...
came to check it out?

13:00.307 --> 13:02.043
Came to check you out.

13:02.058 --> 13:03.903
And I had to ask
you a question.

13:03.918 --> 13:06.352
Which do you like better,
red or blue?

13:06.985 --> 13:09.062
Red, I guess. Why?

13:09.076 --> 13:12.912
I was trying to figure out what
to wear tonight... on our date.

13:12.928 --> 13:15.382
Right... our date...

13:15.427 --> 13:16.661
tonight.

13:16.678 --> 13:17.972
Well, red it is. 

13:17.988 --> 13:19.620
Okay, see you tonight.

13:20.088 --> 13:21.222
Yeah.

13:22.615 --> 13:23.542
Tonight.

13:25.257 --> 13:27.713
Hey, guys, come on in.
Good to see you.

13:27.727 --> 13:29.480
Oh, I'm so excited
to have the kids.

13:29.498 --> 13:31.340
Um, listen,
I don't want you to worry.

13:31.357 --> 13:33.870
I've read all the latest
childcare periodicals,

13:33.886 --> 13:37.990
and I'm CPR certified,
and I've stacked up on organicnacks

13:38.008 --> 13:40.812
and  some really fun learning
games for the kids.

13:40.828 --> 13:42.980
So if you have any questions,
feel free.

13:42.998 --> 13:44.340
Just one.

13:44.358 --> 13:46.182
Do you have the numbers
for the local authorities?

13:46.307 --> 13:47.913
- Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah.
- Super.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.251
I'll see you later.

13:49.267 --> 13:50.523
Okay.

13:53.156 --> 13:55.360
Okay, kids,
what do you want to do first?

13:57.076 --> 13:58.460
Kids?

14:05.055 --> 14:08.902
I'd say, "nice spread," but that's
probably inappropriate for a teacher.

14:08.917 --> 14:11.412
Bet you wouldn't have a
problem saying it to Brooke.

14:11.427 --> 14:13.761
Aren't you her teacher, too?

14:14.167 --> 14:15.741
I get it.

14:16.427 --> 14:18.790
You like to be the
center of attention,

14:18.827 --> 14:20.983
get a rise out of people.

14:21.137 --> 14:23.281
It's the hallmark
of insecurity.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.173
Wow. You're an underpaid
high-school teacher

14:26.188 --> 14:28.933
sleeping with a student,
and I'm insecure?

14:28.947 --> 14:30.563
Yeah, okay.

14:30.576 --> 14:33.521
You seem to be in the driver's seat,
miss Gatina.

14:35.257 --> 14:37.143
So what do you want?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.160
Just one thing.

14:41.368 --> 14:43.771
I think we should close
the door for this.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.743
Hey. Peyton, uh...

14:57.756 --> 14:59.460
you have a visitor.

14:59.656 --> 15:02.323
I have to go to the
café before the game,

15:02.335 --> 15:04.731
and I didn't want you to be alone,
so I called him.

15:05.017 --> 15:07.021
- What happened?
- Nothing.

15:07.655 --> 15:10.593
I don't know.
I had a panic attack, I guess.

15:10.606 --> 15:13.322
So you weren't fine,
but you went to school anyway,

15:13.337 --> 15:14.941
just to prove me wrong.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.191
O kay.

15:16.775 --> 15:20.161
Fine, I learned my lesson,
and now I'm a mess.

15:20.175 --> 15:22.113
You got what you wanted,
I guess.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.272
What I want is for you to
admit you have a problem

15:24.285 --> 15:25.563
so we can deal with it,

15:25.576 --> 15:28.860
instead of hiding and
pretending everythg's fine.

15:29.048 --> 15:32.153
Everday, people all over
the world get beat down.

15:32.168 --> 15:33.982
They lose their families,
they lose their friends,

15:34.018 --> 15:36.553
and every day,
those people fight like hell

15:36.568 --> 15:38.753
to put their lives
back together!

15:38.766 --> 15:40.662
They don't curl in
a ball and give up.

15:40.676 --> 15:42.500
Look, you need to back off.
She's had a rough day.

15:42.537 --> 15:45.390
It won't get easier with you
babying her every step away.

15:45.406 --> 15:47.480
You think you can protect her,
but you can't.

15:47.495 --> 15:50.243
The sooner both of you realize that,
the better.

15:50.358 --> 15:52.400
You know when the world
backs off, Peyton?

15:52.417 --> 15:54.493
- When you make it back off.
- Fine.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.151
Then back the hell off.

15:59.245 --> 16:00.440
Okay.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.670
Guess I'm done wasting my time.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.832
I think I like the
other Derek better.

16:12.247 --> 16:14.913
I'm... sorry.
I shouldn't have called him.

16:14.927 --> 16:16.863
No, it's fine.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.551
He's a pain in the ass,
but he's right.

16:20.075 --> 16:22.862
You should go, too.
I'll meet you at the game.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.351
No, you can come with me.

16:26.228 --> 16:29.191
I can't keep
letting you save me.

16:29.725 --> 16:32.792
Got to learn to
get by on my own.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.943
I'll be fine.

16:34.957 --> 16:37.243
I've got my watchdog.

16:37.338 --> 16:40.673
Yeah, it's...
kind of disturbing.

16:41.795 --> 16:44.203
He keeps the monsters at bay.

16:55.706 --> 16:57.040
Hey.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.752
- How's it going?
- Amazing.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.270
Buyers have been coming up, saying
they want my line in their stores.

17:01.307 --> 17:04.332
I'm so psyched I'd pass out,
but I have another show in an hour.

17:08.298 --> 17:09.680
What's the matter?

17:11.215 --> 17:13.950
I wish my timing was better on this,
but, um...

17:13.965 --> 17:16.142
there's something you
need to know about Nick.

17:17.066 --> 17:18.140
What?

17:18.666 --> 17:21.040
Well, he kept me after
school today, and...

17:21.058 --> 17:23.790
when we were alone,
he hit on me.

17:25.186 --> 17:27.711
You can't see him anymore, Brooke.
He's a bad guy.

17:27.728 --> 17:29.432
Do you understand that?

17:31.885 --> 17:34.120
I understand that you don't
have a boyfriend right now,

17:34.137 --> 17:36.561
and maybe you're feeling a little
jealous. It's normal, but --

17:36.595 --> 17:38.212
All right,
you don't believe me.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.853
You know what? Never mind.

17:41.868 --> 17:43.252
See you later.

17:51.485 --> 17:53.542
Um, what's the holdup?

17:53.555 --> 17:55.232
I-I think there's
a mistake here.

17:55.246 --> 17:58.310
It looks like your doctor has
prescribed three different sedatives.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.690
I have a complicated condition, 

18:00.707 --> 18:03.043
and I'd appreciate a
little sensitivity.

18:03.058 --> 18:05.770
I'm still gonna have to confirm
this with your doctor's office.

18:05.788 --> 18:07.740
Listen, little man!

18:07.755 --> 18:10.002
I don't know what your problem is,
but I don't have time for this crap!

18:10.038 --> 18:12.793
How hard is it to fill
one lousy prescription?!

18:12.808 --> 18:15.103
Just walk your midget,
little legs back there,

18:15.115 --> 18:17.962
put the pills in the bottle,
and hand them over to mommy.

18:17.978 --> 18:20.091
Can  you do that, stumpy?

18:20.108 --> 18:23.253
Y-yeah, yeah.
Yeah, y-yeah, fine.

18:36.458 --> 18:38.082
Randy, sweetie?

18:39.985 --> 18:42.122
Been in there a long time!

18:42.395 --> 18:44.441
I have some snacks!

18:45.906 --> 18:47.543
Is this for me?

18:47.555 --> 18:49.300
Thank you, sweetie.

18:52.646 --> 18:54.873
What is that?

18:54.886 --> 18:57.110
Dirt and water.

18:57.498 --> 18:59.190
Dirt and water?

18:59.498 --> 19:01.191
I don't know--

19:01.288 --> 19:03.073
Oh! Gosh.

19:03.538 --> 19:05.892
Wow! That's a... cool costume.

19:05.908 --> 19:08.073
Slash her, Randy! Slash her!

19:08.246 --> 19:10.321
Slash her, Randy!

19:23.456 --> 19:24.651
Sorry, mom.

19:25.377 --> 19:27.602
I'll pay you back. I promise.

19:39.507 --> 19:42.892
And in local news,
Mayor Scott's ex-wife, Deb Scott,

19:42.908 --> 19:45.640
was arrested today after
attempting to purchase drugs,

19:45.657 --> 19:47.792
using a falsified prescription.

19:49.218 --> 19:51.090
Damn it, mom.

19:51.105 --> 19:52.963
You know who I am?

19:52.978 --> 19:56.981
If convicted, Mrs. Scott could
face up to ten years in prison.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.052
She is currently at Tree Hill
County jail awaiting bail.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.713
Guess Deb won't be
making the game tonight.

20:09.805 --> 20:11.533
Principal Turner,
they told me you wanted to see me,

20:11.568 --> 20:13.061
but I'm kind of
in a rush, so...

20:13.078 --> 20:15.372
Miss Davis,
there are allegations

20:15.388 --> 20:17.892
that our newest teacher,
Mr. Chavez,

20:17.908 --> 20:21.031
has been having sexual
relations with a student,

20:21.257 --> 20:23.801
and we're told that
student is you.

20:24.687 --> 20:26.562
That's not true.

20:26.576 --> 20:29.113
It's a serious matter,
and until it's cleared up,

20:29.125 --> 20:31.440
Mr. Chavez is suspended.

20:31.758 --> 20:34.961
If it comes to light any part
of the allegations are true...

20:34.976 --> 20:36.503
he'll be fired.

20:36.518 --> 20:37.922
But they're not,

20:37.935 --> 20:40.022
and whoever said that
to you is lying.

20:40.035 --> 20:41.482
Who would do that?

20:42.716 --> 20:44.332
I would.

20:59.207 --> 21:01.012
I got suspended today.

21:01.255 --> 21:02.653
I know.

21:02.968 --> 21:05.363
Did you also know that
Rachel's a conniving bitch?

21:05.375 --> 21:07.503
I thought she was a friend of yours.
Why would she go to the principal?

21:07.538 --> 21:09.103
Because she said
you hit on her.

21:09.118 --> 21:10.513
Brooke...

21:10.647 --> 21:11.800
Is it true?

21:11.818 --> 21:13.140
How can you even ask that?

21:13.155 --> 21:15.083
Especially since she hit on me.

21:15.836 --> 21:17.982
She made some snide
comment about us in class.

21:17.998 --> 21:19.110
It got me worried.

21:19.127 --> 21:21.263
I tried talking to her,
but she started coming on to me.

21:21.295 --> 21:23.631
Said she thought
older guys were hot.

21:25.725 --> 21:27.892
I can't believe she'd do that --
not to me.

21:28.045 --> 21:30.972
Brooke, people talk about her.
Even the teachers.

21:30.987 --> 21:34.071
I get the sense that this behavior's
pretty typical for Rachel.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.980
Yeah, but I'm her friend.

21:36.815 --> 21:39.553
Hey... I'm sorry about this.

21:39.996 --> 21:41.873
But I think you know me.

21:41.916 --> 21:43.471
I hope you do.

21:43.486 --> 21:45.560
How well do you know Rachel?

21:48.058 --> 21:49.370
Hey, Brooke?

21:49.385 --> 21:51.020
Oh, sorry if I'm interrupting,

21:51.037 --> 21:53.261
but do you mind if I
borrow this dress tonight?

21:53.275 --> 21:56.731
I'm headed into town with my
girls and I got to look fierce.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.122
Sure.

21:58.137 --> 22:00.022
You know, why don't you keept?

22:00.038 --> 22:01.141
Really?

22:01.158 --> 22:02.671
Ahhh! Thank you!

22:02.686 --> 22:05.350
Aah. Hey, what do you think?

22:05.367 --> 22:06.721
Bitchin', right?

22:06.735 --> 22:08.131
Definitely.

22:08.197 --> 22:09.482
Okay.

22:09.558 --> 22:11.202
That's some dress.

22:12.038 --> 22:13.601
What do you think my
chances are of getting

22:13.638 --> 22:16.983
such an amazing,
talented designer to kiss me?

22:32.876 --> 22:36.352
So, which one of you
whores is my ex-wife?

22:36.367 --> 22:38.611
Oh, right.
The old one on the end.

22:38.626 --> 22:41.723
You came all the way down here
just to rub it in my face?

22:41.996 --> 22:43.412
Yes.

22:43.435 --> 22:45.661
But I also have a proposition.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.423
I can get you out of this fix.

22:55.647 --> 22:57.983
But you have to sign
Tric back to Karen.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.432
Go to hell.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.030
No, I don't think
you understand.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.010
I can bail you out and
use my clout as mayor

23:04.027 --> 23:05.433
to have the charges dropped.

23:05.448 --> 23:08.400
Hell, I'll even throw in a couple
of painkillers for your ride home.

23:08.418 --> 23:11.151
Or you can risk spending the
next two to four years in prison

23:11.168 --> 23:13.052
as some con's cell bitch

23:13.068 --> 23:15.923
instead of the regular
old bitch you usually are.

23:21.006 --> 23:23.082
You make this go away,

23:23.098 --> 23:25.252
and I'm not going to rehab.

23:25.266 --> 23:27.371
O.D. for all I care, Deb,

23:27.387 --> 23:29.862
but you're signing Tric
back over to Karen.

23:30.126 --> 23:32.210
I'll see you on
the outside, boozy.

23:43.728 --> 23:45.470
Miss Dunbar?

23:46.007 --> 23:47.253
Hi.

23:47.608 --> 23:50.030
Yeah, everything's great.
I was just wondering

23:50.045 --> 23:52.711
when you might be able to
come pick up the kids.

23:53.655 --> 23:58.242
Well, it's just that I was
expecting you -- over an hour ago.

24:00.487 --> 24:04.410
Well, no,
I can't because my husband's got --

24:05.627 --> 24:07.201
Hello?!

24:14.937 --> 24:16.313
Hey!

24:19.167 --> 24:21.583
Who wants to go for a ride?

24:25.907 --> 24:27.781
The crowd is electric tonight.

24:27.798 --> 24:29.453
One more win,
and the Tree Hill Ravens

24:29.467 --> 24:33.142
will make the state finals for
the first time in 18 years.

24:33.156 --> 24:36.403
More than ever before,
all eyes are on Nathan Scott.

24:36.438 --> 24:38.933
Hey, coach,
I thought you should know...

24:39.287 --> 24:41.850
I made the call to Duke.
I'm gonna take the scholarship.

24:41.866 --> 24:43.042
What about Haley?

24:43.058 --> 24:44.670
She's gonna come with me.

24:44.686 --> 24:47.592
Well, congratulations, son.
You're doing the right thing.

24:47.606 --> 24:49.512
But more importantly...

24:49.527 --> 24:51.862
you're doing it the right way.

24:52.328 --> 24:53.793
Thanks, coach.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.811
Hey, what are those
guys doing here?

25:01.027 --> 25:02.511
How should I know?

25:02.525 --> 25:04.893
Well, I saw you talking to
them on the River Court.

25:06.168 --> 25:07.833
Mind your own business, Luke.

25:18.236 --> 25:21.251
Oh! Well, nice outfit, Brooke.

25:21.266 --> 25:23.452
I am so jealous of it.

25:23.527 --> 25:26.240
Oh, wait, look.
I'm wearing the same thing.

25:26.257 --> 25:28.313
I am so freaking
full of jealousy.

25:28.328 --> 25:30.531
Yeah, I know something
else you're full of.

26:19.876 --> 26:23.563
I didn't make it five minutes in there.
Go ahead. Call me a baby.

26:23.578 --> 26:26.813
I didn't come to call you a baby.
I'm here to apologize.

26:27.318 --> 26:30.843
Look, if I promise to quit
being a damn jackass,

26:30.857 --> 26:32.371
you think you could forgive me?

26:33.358 --> 26:34.822
I don't know.

26:35.178 --> 26:37.412
I was kind of getting
used to the yelling.

26:37.426 --> 26:40.493
Look... I know this
psycho's still out there,

26:40.506 --> 26:43.692
and I know what he did to you,
but you have a choice.

26:43.706 --> 26:45.412
You can let it destroy you,

26:45.428 --> 26:47.491
or you can get up and fight.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.251
And if it feels like
I'm beating up on you,

26:49.266 --> 26:52.373
it's only because I want you to get so
pissed off you start swinging back.

26:52.387 --> 26:54.780
Well, I don't know if
I'm strong enough.

26:54.798 --> 26:56.403
If you feel like you're
not strong enough,

26:56.437 --> 26:58.100
then fall back on me.

26:58.127 --> 26:59.872
Because I'll be here.

26:59.888 --> 27:01.292
Okay?

27:01.505 --> 27:03.792
I'll be here as long
as you keep trying.

27:05.265 --> 27:07.362
You said you didn't want that.

27:07.848 --> 27:09.171
I know.

27:09.185 --> 27:11.710
It's just I haven't let
many people in, Peyton.

27:11.725 --> 27:14.461
So maybe I was the
one who was scared.

27:17.025 --> 27:18.780
Five minutes, huh?

27:19.837 --> 27:21.503
Tomorrow it'll be six.

27:21.518 --> 27:22.940
- Okay.
- All right.

27:37.315 --> 27:39.441
Hold onto the ball, Scott!

27:39.456 --> 27:41.460
Come on, Nate, kick the ball out, man.
What's up?

27:41.477 --> 27:42.593
Sorry.

27:49.967 --> 27:52.343
What is going on out there?

27:52.356 --> 27:56.733
Can somebody explain to me
why we're only four points up

27:56.745 --> 27:59.803
when we should be blowing
them out of the water?!

28:00.448 --> 28:03.760
It's like you guys are
trying to give away points!

28:04.665 --> 28:07.281
Get out there and shoot around!

28:07.298 --> 28:08.791
You need it!

28:11.806 --> 28:13.281
Hey, Nate...

28:13.616 --> 28:15.303
- what's going on?
- With what?

28:15.318 --> 28:16.483
Well, the way you're
playing tonight.

28:16.515 --> 28:17.792
It's not nerves. I know you.

28:17.807 --> 28:19.281
You don't know anything.

28:19.295 --> 28:21.890
Well, I know you were
having money problems.

28:21.905 --> 28:23.730
And I know Dan
didn't help you out.

28:23.748 --> 28:25.960
Then suddenly you're talking to
those guys out there on court,

28:25.995 --> 28:28.520
and now you're
playing like crap.

28:29.396 --> 28:31.230
What do they want
you to do, Nate?

28:31.248 --> 28:32.763
What -- lose the game?

28:32.778 --> 28:35.290
Betray your teammates and your
coach for a couple of bucks?

28:35.308 --> 28:36.630
All right, listen to me.

28:36.645 --> 28:38.950
Take the self-righteous
attitude and shove it.

28:38.966 --> 28:41.680
Until you're drowning in debt,
you've got a wife and a kid on the way,

28:41.715 --> 28:43.840
you can't begin to understand
what I'm going through.

28:43.858 --> 28:46.790
You better help me understand,
or I'm going to Whitey.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.703
Listen, I'd never
lose a game, okay?

28:51.716 --> 28:53.420
We're still gonna win...

28:53.437 --> 28:55.680
just by less than 10 points.

28:56.158 --> 28:57.650
Lucas, don't, okay?

28:57.668 --> 29:00.151
The only reason we've gone
this far is because of me.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.680
And besides,
all anybody cares about is winning.

29:01.718 --> 29:03.800
Nobody cares if I gave
it my all or not.

29:03.818 --> 29:05.693
Do you really believe that?

29:05.887 --> 29:08.853
Yeah, okay?
I have to believe that.

29:08.867 --> 29:10.820
I got no other way out.

29:10.835 --> 29:13.590
Unless you got 15
grand lying around.

29:15.356 --> 29:17.342
Is there a problem here?

29:21.178 --> 29:22.430
No.

29:34.458 --> 29:36.490
Gee, I really need to
stop being roommates

29:36.508 --> 29:38.442
with boyfriend-stealing
skanks, Peyton.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.660
Oh, I mean, Rachel.

29:41.028 --> 29:42.490
What are you talking about?

29:42.507 --> 29:44.800
I talked to Nick.
He told me what really happened.

29:44.815 --> 29:47.261
You went in, shoved your 
magazine spread in his face,

29:47.275 --> 29:48.612
and hit on him.

29:48.867 --> 29:50.362
I wouldn't do that to you.

29:50.376 --> 29:53.573
Really? Let's go over the list
of things you have done to me.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.840
You tried to seduce Lucas
when he was my boyfriend,

29:55.857 --> 29:57.480
take my spot as cheer captain,

29:57.498 --> 30:01.832
and two weeks ago, you told the
entire school that I was pregnant!

30:02.268 --> 30:05.052
I was just beginning to
think you were a real person,

30:05.065 --> 30:08.141
but you're just a slutty,
lying liar who lies.

30:10.825 --> 30:12.571
- Gimme, gimme!
- Gimme, gimme!

30:12.585 --> 30:14.843
It's not polite,
you guys. Here.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.813
Thank you. Sorry... sorry.

30:16.827 --> 30:19.103
Hey -- Hey, you guys.
Now, don't throw popcorn.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.993
Hey! Hey!
That is not a nice thing to do.

30:21.005 --> 30:22.861
Hey, Haley!
How's the babysitting going?

30:22.876 --> 30:26.191
It's horrible.
These kids are driving me crazy.

30:26.207 --> 30:28.011
The game's already started.
I'm completely stressed out.

30:28.047 --> 30:30.893
It's everything I can do...
Karen, what am I doing wrong?

30:30.908 --> 30:32.070
- You want the truth?
- Yes.

30:32.087 --> 30:34.071
Nothing. You just
got to hang in there.

30:34.087 --> 30:35.293
No, no!

30:43.067 --> 30:44.571
Glad you could make it.

30:45.436 --> 30:46.572
What's this?

30:46.587 --> 30:48.380
Ownership papers to Tric.

30:48.395 --> 30:49.691
It's all yours.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.153
Dan, what did you do?

30:51.168 --> 30:53.153
Oh, I just beat some
sense into Deb.

30:53.168 --> 30:54.661
I'm kidding.

30:54.707 --> 30:56.441
I caught her at a
rare sober moment,

30:56.457 --> 30:58.781
offered to get her some
help in exchange for Tric.

30:59.116 --> 31:01.552
Look, uh, accepting an old
crib from you is one thing,

31:01.567 --> 31:03.313
but this is too much.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.140
You'd rather Deb have it?

31:05.225 --> 31:07.610
You saw the news.
She could barely take care of herself.

31:08.456 --> 31:10.531
Look, no matter your
feelings for me,

31:10.548 --> 31:13.250
this is the right thing to do --
for you and the baby...

31:13.268 --> 31:14.810
and for business.

31:15.178 --> 31:17.233
Tell me I'm wrong --
I'll take it back.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.723
Okay, it's definitely the
strangest gift I've ever gotten.

31:31.736 --> 31:34.301
Not sure that I'm "Million
Dollar Baby" material.

31:34.315 --> 31:37.652
Trust me. If we share any genes,
you've got some fight in you.

31:37.667 --> 31:39.373
Where'd you learn to box?

31:39.385 --> 31:43.192
My dad -- well, our dad --
started me really young.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.633
That was before he
left my mom and me.

31:46.007 --> 31:48.163
You know? Guess this is why
I didn't want to meet you.

31:51.015 --> 31:55.092
You know, I always hated him
for leaving and meeting Ellie...

31:55.175 --> 31:58.283
and having you --
even though I didn't know you.

31:59.157 --> 32:02.402
That kind of anger used to eat me up,
you know?

32:02.458 --> 32:04.470
Then I started punching it out.

32:04.646 --> 32:08.323
You know, taking the pain head on,
driving it back.

32:08.935 --> 32:11.400
I'm hoping you could
do the same, okay?

32:12.176 --> 32:15.122
"The world backs off when
you make it back off," right?

32:15.258 --> 32:16.320
Yeah.

32:16.337 --> 32:19.321
I don't --
I don't know if I can.

32:19.406 --> 32:21.490
I do. Come on.

32:21.556 --> 32:24.360
Now, you want to use your whole body,
all right?

32:24.378 --> 32:26.830
You want to an on this foot here,
all right?

32:29.696 --> 32:30.973
Okay.

32:32.685 --> 32:33.792
Yeah.

32:36.606 --> 32:40.100
Time winding down in the fourth quarter,
and the Ravens have a 7-point lead --

32:40.117 --> 32:43.260
now 9 points.
And the Cats are gonna call time-out.

32:46.886 --> 32:48.682
Nathan, take a seat.

32:48.696 --> 32:49.953
What? Why?

32:49.966 --> 32:51.390
Because we're up by 9,

32:51.407 --> 32:54.571
and I'm not gonna expose my
best player to injuries.

32:54.586 --> 32:56.130
Coach, we only got a
couple seconds left.

32:56.165 --> 32:58.993
It only takes one to blow out a knee.
Now sit down.

32:59.007 --> 33:00.710
Luke, come here.

33:02.345 --> 33:04.463
Look, they're gonna
be looking to foul.

33:04.478 --> 33:06.391
You're our best
free-throw shooter.

33:06.408 --> 33:09.240
Now, I want you to go in
there and ice this thing.

33:12.048 --> 33:14.510
One, two, three -- Ravens!

33:19.136 --> 33:21.251
If the Ravens score
one more point,

33:21.265 --> 33:24.023
Nathan Scott doesn't leave
this gym in one piece.

33:25.407 --> 33:28.842
So, Lucas Scott checks in to the game.
The Ravens are up by 9.

33:28.856 --> 33:32.792
Just five seconds stand between them
and a trip to the state championship.

33:32.806 --> 33:35.571
Three seconds now.
The Ravens pick up a quick steal!

33:35.586 --> 33:37.000
And that's gonna ice it.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.562
With two seconds
left on the clock,

33:38.576 --> 33:40.791
the Ravens are headed to
the state championship.

33:40.805 --> 33:43.001
All that remains is for
Lucas Scott to seal it.

33:43.015 --> 33:44.953
What's his free-throw
percentage, Gigi?

33:44.966 --> 33:50.351
Well, he's 92% from the line...
and 100% hot.

34:32.906 --> 34:35.821
If Luke can make this free-throw,
the lead will be 10 points,

34:35.835 --> 34:39.481
and that would be the Ravens' ninth
double-digit victory of the season.

34:47.908 --> 34:50.150
The shot is up.
And it's no good!

34:50.165 --> 34:53.411
The Cats rebound, the buzzer sounds,
and this one's over!

34:54.554 --> 34:55.870
We won!

34:55.888 --> 35:00.010
The crowd go on the floor and
this place is going crazy.

35:02.036 --> 35:03.970
The Ravens have won by 9!

35:03.985 --> 35:06.842
They're headed to the
state championship, baby!

35:12.277 --> 35:13.673
Yeah!

35:28.706 --> 35:30.151
Yo Mouth!

35:30.167 --> 35:32.912
Great job on the
play-by-play, dawg.

35:32.926 --> 35:35.081
But now that we going to state,
I kind of want to pump up

35:35.116 --> 35:38.271
my profile a little bit.
So... I was thinking...

35:38.285 --> 35:41.261
maybe you could start
referring to me as...

35:41.275 --> 35:43.431
"Mad Skills Taylor."

35:44.678 --> 35:46.540
Everything cool, man?

35:47.317 --> 35:49.032
Actually, I need your advice.

35:49.045 --> 35:50.772
Um, if you had to choose a date

35:50.788 --> 35:53.943
between a super-hot model
and her model friends

35:53.955 --> 35:57.890
or a nice girl
who's kind of odd,

35:57.988 --> 35:59.270
who'd you pick?

35:59.287 --> 36:02.420
Hmm... that's an
interesting dilemma.

36:03.538 --> 36:08.920
I say pick the girl that's the
most beautiful on the inside.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.743
Man, is you crazy?!

36:11.756 --> 36:14.163
Look, first of all,
models ain't just walking around

36:14.175 --> 36:19.023
handing out party passes to no
too-short, no-ass kids like you.

36:19.105 --> 36:23.373
No disrespect, I'm just saying...
don't blow it.

36:23.388 --> 36:25.682
I mean, opportunity 
only gonna knock once.

36:25.696 --> 36:28.571
And if you don't answer...
I will.

36:36.568 --> 36:38.981
I'm sorry, have you guys seen
a little boy, a little girl,

36:38.998 --> 36:41.403
blond-hair, blue-eyed,
really loud and...?

36:41.418 --> 36:42.701
Great.

36:52.375 --> 36:55.200
All right, ready? Okay.

36:55.217 --> 36:57.760
So, I'm gonna teach you how
to shoot real quick, okay?

36:57.777 --> 36:59.880
Put this hand here,
that's just for balance.

36:59.895 --> 37:01.970
Put your index
finger right there.

37:04.408 --> 37:06.662
Whoa, that was awesome!
When I grow up,

37:06.676 --> 37:08.902
I want to be just like you.

37:18.335 --> 37:20.363
All right, you try.

37:24.985 --> 37:26.200
Brooke.

37:26.215 --> 37:28.742
Hey. Do you mind
if I stay here?

37:28.757 --> 37:30.981
After all that stuff that
happened with Rachel today,

37:30.997 --> 37:32.983
I just can't stay
with her tonight.

37:32.995 --> 37:36.250
Sure, but I was just heading
out to get something to eat.

37:36.268 --> 37:37.540
Want to?

37:37.555 --> 37:39.301
Yeah. Yeah, I'm starving.

37:39.316 --> 37:40.861
Let me just put my bag down.

37:46.757 --> 37:48.170
Brooke.

37:54.015 --> 37:55.230
Brooke.

37:59.406 --> 38:02.263
Well, I don't know
who I hate more...

38:02.278 --> 38:03.942
Mr. Chavez.

38:03.958 --> 38:06.122
You, for being a lying bastard

38:06.136 --> 38:09.701
or me for believing your crap
and betraying my friend.

38:28.677 --> 38:31.790
Regret comes in all
shapes and sizes.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.791
Some are small...

38:33.898 --> 38:37.023
like when we do a bad
thing for a good reason.

38:38.628 --> 38:40.190
Hi, friend.

38:40.926 --> 38:44.511
Some are bigger...
like when we let down a friend.

38:44.526 --> 38:45.802
You were right.

38:47.407 --> 38:49.360
I'm sorry, Brooke.

38:49.466 --> 38:51.430
I wish I wasn't.

39:09.477 --> 39:12.022
Some of us escape
the pangs of regret

39:12.038 --> 39:14.011
by making the right choice.

39:14.136 --> 39:15.500
Hi.

39:15.768 --> 39:17.961
I'm glad I picked red.

39:19.598 --> 39:21.533
You look beautiful.

39:28.098 --> 39:30.481
Thank you. Goodbye.

39:36.035 --> 39:38.400
That's actually kind of sweet.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.502
Or not.

39:46.458 --> 39:48.513
You still think you like kids?

39:50.937 --> 39:52.911
I'll like our kid.

39:55.825 --> 39:57.821
Some of us have little
time for regret

39:57.835 --> 40:00.420
because we're looking
forward to the future.

40:05.317 --> 40:09.641
Sometimes we have to fight to
come to terms with the past.

40:13.586 --> 40:16.293
And sometimes we
bury our regret

40:16.578 --> 40:19.510
by promising to
change our ways.

40:27.687 --> 40:29.423
Wanted to say thanks.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.881
I know how hard it was for you
to throw those points away.

40:33.346 --> 40:37.201
Look... I'll make it up to you
and the team at state, okay?

40:37.216 --> 40:39.621
The point-shaving was
just a one-time thing.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.723
It's over now.

40:43.037 --> 40:45.272
But our biggest regrets

40:45.636 --> 40:47.952
are not for the
things we did...

40:48.576 --> 40:51.162
but for the things
we didn't do.

40:52.445 --> 40:54.481
Things we didn't say...

40:55.846 --> 40:58.420
that could have saved
someone we care about...

40:58.436 --> 40:59.930
Nathan...

41:04.307 --> 41:06.980
you know I'll always
be there for you.

41:10.196 --> 41:12.213
But never again.

41:24.616 --> 41:28.932
...especially when we can see the
dark storm that's headed their way.
