00:00.001 --> 00:01.000
Previously on californication

00:01.010 --> 00:03.901
I think we should
go into business together.

00:04.267 --> 00:07.233
To be honest, i'm interviewing
for jobs in new york.

00:07.267 --> 00:08.634
So, how do you two
know each other?

00:08.667 --> 00:10.934
<i>Hank is the father.
Alleged father.</i>

00:10.968 --> 00:14.934
I'll raise the child,
and i'll love it as my own.

00:14.968 --> 00:16.033
Oh, my god.

00:16.068 --> 00:17.968
Look, look, look... 
damien and becca.

00:18.001 --> 00:20.667
Because isn't that
the becca right there?

00:20.701 --> 00:21.968
Oh! Bec!

00:22.001 --> 00:24.801
I don't want to do
any more porn.
Really?

00:24.834 --> 00:27.567
I'd like the last person i had
on-Screen sex with to be you.

00:27.601 --> 00:28.667
Charlie:
all right, marcy.

00:28.701 --> 00:30.667
After all the shit
we've been through,

00:30.701 --> 00:31.801
I want to get a divorce.

00:31.834 --> 00:33.233
I'm gonna be with daisy.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.434
You fucked my man.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.734
Marcy,
i didn't mean... 

00:36.801 --> 00:38.334
She's here.
She who?

00:38.367 --> 00:39.734
"She who"?
Janie, you asshole!

00:39.767 --> 00:41.100
Come on!

00:43.601 --> 00:44.701

You got yourself
a bit of a ritual there, huh?

02:01.567 --> 02:02.934
Yep.

02:02.968 --> 02:07.601
Every time i finish a book,
whiskey, weed, and warren zevon.

02:07.634 --> 02:09.400
It's the little things.

02:09.434 --> 02:11.434
Yeah.
How'd it turn out?
Hard to say.

02:11.467 --> 02:14.567
You would know better than i.
You lived the motherfucker.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.667
Yeah,
but living it right

02:15.701 --> 02:17.233
Means you don't remember
much of it at all.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.400
Well, you can
read all about it here... 

02:19.434 --> 02:20.867
Your dirty life and times.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.801
What's next?

02:24.834 --> 02:29.567
I suppose i try to get my life
back in order in some fashion.

02:29.601 --> 02:31.133
Yeah, you... 

02:31.167 --> 02:32.734
You do that.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.968
Remember,
at the end of the day,

02:36.001 --> 02:37.867
It's all about her.

02:37.901 --> 02:39.767
Who?

02:39.801 --> 02:41.434
You know.

02:43.834 --> 02:47.001
I'll miss seeing you
around here, man.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.634
Gonna miss you, too.

02:52.068 --> 02:54.267
And it's true
what they say, you know.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.200
They got
one hell of a band.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.034
What up, buttercup?

04:20.934 --> 04:24.434
Oh, i just thought
i'd pay my last respects

04:24.467 --> 04:27.300
Before i hit the road.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.734
Where you headed?

04:28.767 --> 04:30.567
Oh, didn't you get
the memo?
Mnh-Mnh.

04:30.601 --> 04:32.701
I'm taking
"fucking & punching"

04:32.734 --> 04:34.300
All over this fair country
of ours.

04:34.334 --> 04:37.100
Coming soon to a supersized
bookstore near you.

04:37.133 --> 04:39.233
Mothers,
lock up your sons.

04:39.267 --> 04:41.500
And husbands.

04:49.167 --> 04:50.834
I'm gonna miss him... 

04:50.867 --> 04:52.734
Way more than i thought.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.400
Yeah,
i know the feeling.

04:54.434 --> 04:57.701
At first,
fucking him was... 

04:57.734 --> 04:59.867
Was just a way
of yanking your chain.

04:59.901 --> 05:01.467
Really?
You don't say?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.567
Yeah, but then he just had to
win me over, you know?

05:04.601 --> 05:07.200
Like some sweet,
mangy little puppy

05:07.233 --> 05:08.601
Who just wanted someone
to pet him

05:08.634 --> 05:09.901
And tell him
he was a good boy.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.767
Then he'd shit the rug.
Or hump your leg.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.467
Mm.
Where's your first stop?

05:14.500 --> 05:16.133
Uh, borders in tacoma.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.767
Know it. There's a great
coffee shop down the street.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.434
Around the block,
there's this old record store,

05:21.467 --> 05:23.834
Sells used vinyl, tons of it... 
fantastic.

05:23.867 --> 05:26.767
Great...  old guy's guide
to tacoma. Good to know.

05:26.801 --> 05:30.400
Well, just be gentle with
our retarded love child.

05:30.434 --> 05:31.601
I will.

05:32.567 --> 05:34.901
Be good out there,
psycho.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.734
Tell 'em who sent you.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.801
Well, if it isn't
the madre of my bambino.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.400
What's shakin', sweet duck?

05:53.434 --> 05:54.701
I got a job.

05:54.734 --> 05:55.901
A good job?

05:55.934 --> 05:59.167
A great job.
I mean, my dream job.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.701
Wow,
way to go, fancy pants.

06:00.734 --> 06:03.701
Yeah.
It's, um... 

06:03.734 --> 06:04.968
It's in new york.

06:05.001 --> 06:06.300
Even better.

06:06.334 --> 06:08.767
Right.
I start monday.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.233
No time
like the present.

06:10.267 --> 06:12.767
Oh, my god. You're taking this
much better than i thought.

06:12.801 --> 06:14.100
Why shouldn't i?

06:14.133 --> 06:17.334
I've been trying to get
back to new york for years now.

06:17.367 --> 06:18.434
Hank.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.601
Karen.

06:19.634 --> 06:21.001
<i>I got a job.</i>

06:21.034 --> 06:23.133
You got a job.
That's what you just said.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.367
Not you.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.300
No. Not... 
i'm not following.

06:27.334 --> 06:30.100
No, you're not following.
I mean, you're not invited.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.767
That is fucked up.

06:32.801 --> 06:35.068
Well, this is not about
you or us, okay.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.534
This is about me and becca.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.200
But you can't
just whisk her away

06:38.233 --> 06:41.167
And expect me to sit here in
l.A. With a dry thumb up my ass.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.367
Well, you know what?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.801
You do have some serious shit
to deal with here.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.100
Karen,
i can write anywhere... 

06:47.133 --> 06:49.901
Or not, as the case may be,
which is not the case.

06:49.934 --> 06:51.734
I just finished
the ashby book

06:51.767 --> 06:53.534
This morning,
as a matter of fact.
Good.

06:53.567 --> 06:54.968
Honey, i'm on fire... 
good for you.

06:55.001 --> 06:56.500
... which is why
we should be together,

06:56.534 --> 06:59.367
Or, at the very least,
why i should be your manny.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.034
Do you laugh?

07:02.068 --> 07:03.133
My manny?
Yeah!

07:03.167 --> 07:05.133
You're a high-Powered
career gal now.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.500
You need somebody
to hold down the fort.
Right.

07:07.534 --> 07:08.534
A majordomo.
Thank you.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.801
I'm your man, woman.

07:09.834 --> 07:12.701
I'm not talking about your
writing or lack thereof, okay?

07:12.734 --> 07:16.100
I was talking about
the impending arrival
of your latest mistake.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.367
D-Did you forget?

07:17.400 --> 07:19.867
Uh, sir francis drake
said he was totally down

07:19.901 --> 07:22.133
With raising
the little bastard as his own.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.400
You heard
the bearded woman.
Y-You're okay with that?

07:24.434 --> 07:26.133
I'm not entirely convinced
it's mine.

07:26.167 --> 07:27.767
You know,
i never came inside her.

07:27.801 --> 07:29.367
I don't... 
i don't think i did.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.233
I mean,
when she broncoed me,

07:31.267 --> 07:33.068
I spasmed out
a little dog water, you know.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.068
Thank you.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.567
I'm still
holding out the hope

07:35.601 --> 07:38.001
That she banged some dude
in the p.F. Chang's parking lot

07:38.034 --> 07:39.701
While she was looking for
mr. Goodbar.

07:39.734 --> 07:41.734
I think that's
an entirely plausible scenario.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.300
There is something wrong
with you.

07:43.334 --> 07:44.434
Well, i'm special.

07:44.467 --> 07:45.901
I think i'm special.
I really do.

07:45.934 --> 07:48.901
What does jeff becca think about
you tearing our family apart?

07:48.934 --> 07:51.901
Well, no...  right now... 
she's heartbroken right now.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.367
Yeah, of course
she's heartbroken.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.834
You rip her away
from her old man,

07:54.867 --> 07:56.434
You don't invite him
to come with.

07:56.467 --> 07:57.567
That shit is harsh!

07:57.601 --> 07:59.133
She's heartbroken
about damien.

07:59.167 --> 08:00.233
What about damien?

08:00.267 --> 08:02.001
Well,
she saw him making out

08:02.034 --> 08:05.968
With someone else
at mia's party, so... 

08:12.834 --> 08:15.233
Welcome to all american burger.
May i take your order?

08:15.267 --> 08:18.200
Can i get a jumbo "what the fuck
were you thinking?"

08:18.233 --> 08:20.801
<i>That's the problem... 
i wasn't thinking.</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:24.534
I mean,
she fucking kissed me, dude.

08:24.567 --> 08:30.034
That kind of shit just doesn't
just happen to me a lot... 

08:30.068 --> 08:31.267
Like ever.

08:31.300 --> 08:35.133
W...  w...  yo.

08:35.167 --> 08:38.534
Be that as it may,
on the flip side,

08:38.567 --> 08:41.500
What i've got is a young girl
whose heart is broken.

08:41.534 --> 08:42.667
Yeah, i know.

08:42.701 --> 08:45.534
I know, and i feel all sorts
of awful about it.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.934
But, you know,
i've been thinking about it,

08:49.968 --> 08:54.267
And given the opportunity
to...  to do it again,

08:54.300 --> 08:56.734
I don't think it would go
any differently, honestly.

08:56.767 --> 09:03.400
I mean, a beautiful girl
is kind enough to kiss you... 

09:03.434 --> 09:05.367
Fuck,
you kiss her right back.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.133
'Cause... 

09:07.167 --> 09:09.068
You know,
who...  who knows

09:09.100 --> 09:12.100
Where that kiss
is gonna take you?

09:17.734 --> 09:19.500
I went there
to kick his ass,

09:19.534 --> 09:21.567
And i stayed
to soak up his wisdom.

09:21.601 --> 09:24.601
They know more than we do... 
the children. We forget.

09:24.634 --> 09:27.601
Which is why we end up
in these fucked-Up situations.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.467
Yeah. Selling bmws
in the valley... 

09:29.500 --> 09:31.133
What the fuck, dude?

09:31.167 --> 09:33.934
Don't kid yourself, pal.
I always was.

09:33.968 --> 09:35.968
Selling writers, actors,
directors... 

09:36.001 --> 09:37.167
It's all the same shit.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.001
Have you talked to
the marce?

09:39.034 --> 09:40.567
Through the lawyers.

09:40.601 --> 09:42.734
She's a little feral
right now... 

09:42.767 --> 09:45.034
Wants to take me
for all i'm worth.

09:45.068 --> 09:46.834
Oh, no.
All four figures?

09:46.867 --> 09:48.968
I don't even care, really.

09:49.001 --> 09:50.834
I just want to be happy,
you know.

09:50.867 --> 09:53.233
That's all that matters now... 
the big happy.

09:53.267 --> 09:55.334
Right...  pimping rides,
living in a studio apartment

09:55.367 --> 09:56.867
In the valley
with a porno chick.

09:56.901 --> 10:00.034
<i>Hey, hey, hey... 
retired porno chick.</i>

10:00.068 --> 10:02.100
She's taking
some groundlings classes.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.400
She's really quite funny.

10:03.434 --> 10:05.467
I am sure she's a deep-Throating
lucille ball.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.068
Bully for her,
but what about you?

10:07.100 --> 10:10.233
Does this work for you,
give you the big happy?

10:10.267 --> 10:12.867
More than you know, pal.
I feel like i'm 23 again.

10:12.901 --> 10:15.867
You know, life is simple.
It's good.

10:15.901 --> 10:17.601
Money's a little tight,
you know.

10:17.634 --> 10:19.867
I think i'm gonna have to use
the office xerox

10:19.901 --> 10:21.068
To copy your manuscript.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.200
I'm so happy
i stayed with you.

10:23.233 --> 10:26.400
Me too. Good for us.
We're making shit happen.

10:26.434 --> 10:27.667
Let's go, runkle.

10:27.701 --> 10:30.001
You got to be on that
sales floor at all times.

10:30.034 --> 10:33.367
A.B.C., baby... 
"always be closing."

10:33.400 --> 10:35.500
Yes, sir!

10:35.534 --> 10:38.068
"A.B.C., baby... 
'always be closing'".

10:38.100 --> 10:39.200
These fucking guys... 

10:39.233 --> 10:40.701
They all think
they're the only one

10:40.734 --> 10:42.267
Who ever saw
"glengarry glen ross."

10:42.300 --> 10:43.601
Hey, if you want,

10:43.634 --> 10:45.767
I'll take you out back
and shoot you.

10:45.801 --> 10:47.068
I will let you know.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.734
That number, my friend,

10:48.767 --> 10:52.634
Puts you in a beautiful
'07 convertible with navigation.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.968
Oh, you're good.

10:55.001 --> 10:58.100
How we doing over here?
Chuck runkle.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.467
Man:
nice to meet you.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.400
There goes my agent.

11:05.801 --> 11:07.867
I'm sick to my stomach.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.034
It's gonna get better.
I promise.

11:10.068 --> 11:11.534
Maybe it does,
maybe it doesn't.

11:11.567 --> 11:12.801
Well... 

11:12.834 --> 11:15.100
Either way, dad,
words don't help.
Yeah.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.334
I suddenly understand the appeal
of cigarettes and alcohol.

11:18.367 --> 11:21.001
Here's an idea...  why don't you
hang behind with me

11:21.034 --> 11:22.734
And nurse
your broken heart?

11:22.767 --> 11:25.100
We could, uh,
smoke some cigarettes,

11:25.133 --> 11:27.133
Pass the bottle,
listen to some blues.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.434
It'll be fun.

11:28.467 --> 11:30.200
Hank, that is
very manipulative.

11:30.233 --> 11:32.968
No! It's not.
It's not manipulative.

11:33.001 --> 11:34.734
Dad... 
it's a suggestion.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.334
... i'm going with mom.
I need a change of scenery.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.801
I don't want to be
driving down the street

11:39.834 --> 11:42.167
And be reminded of all
the places we kissed.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.400
"All the places"?!

11:43.434 --> 11:46.267
What kind of an operation
are you... running here?

11:46.300 --> 11:47.667
What the hell?

11:47.701 --> 11:49.834
Hey, no, don't answer that.
It's rude.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.634
No, it's sonja.
It could be important.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.300
<i>Well, really
don't answer it.</i>

11:53.334 --> 11:55.200
No! It's around
the due date, right?

11:55.233 --> 11:56.867
Right to voicemail... 
that's what it's for.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.167
No, no.
Excuse me, sweetie.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.601
Hey, sonja.

11:59.634 --> 12:01.267
You are?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.367
Drugs!
I want some fucking drugs!

12:03.400 --> 12:06.801
Fuck! Can't you hippies
make this shit stop?!

12:06.834 --> 12:08.767
Breathe, mommy.
It's all about transc... 

12:08.801 --> 12:11.968
Okay, you know what? Fuck you,
you stupid fucking doula!

12:12.001 --> 12:14.367
Hey.
Oh, god.
Hey. Hi, guys.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.200
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

12:16.233 --> 12:17.367
And by the way, hank,
fuck you

12:17.400 --> 12:19.334
For putting this goddamn monster
in my stomach.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.701
I'm not entirely sure it's mine.
There will be some genetic... 

12:21.734 --> 12:23.834
Hank,
do not be an asshole!

12:23.867 --> 12:26.001
You're right, and when
you're right, you're right.

12:26.034 --> 12:29.001
<i>Let's get the little fucker out
first, then we're gonna test.</i>

12:29.034 --> 12:31.968
Oh, hey, look at you.
Look who showed up.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.634
I'm back.
The man's back.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.867
Have you been drinking?

12:35.901 --> 12:38.034
Just a little tequila
for the pain.

12:38.068 --> 12:41.233
You bearded fucking lunatic.
Who do you think you are?!

12:41.267 --> 12:42.867
You're stressed out,
huh?!

12:42.901 --> 12:44.534
You need a drink?!
Shh.

12:44.567 --> 12:46.001
You know what?
Don't come near me.

12:46.034 --> 12:48.801
I'll rip his fucking handlebars
right off your fucking face!

12:48.834 --> 12:50.034
I'll do it.
Fucking drunk.

12:50.068 --> 12:52.034
Come on. You got to get
your shit together.

12:52.068 --> 12:55.901
It's time to stand up
and extract that little
artist within. Come on.

12:55.934 --> 12:57.767
I'm just a fraud,
hank.

12:57.801 --> 12:59.167
I know,
but it's time to stand up.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.034
No.
Take the dress off
already.

13:01.068 --> 13:02.567
Oh, stop.

13:02.601 --> 13:04.834
I am.
Don't. Don't.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.400
No, actually, actually,
that's good. That's good.

13:07.434 --> 13:09.001
You march over there
with those tears,

13:09.034 --> 13:10.867
And you tell her
those are tears of joy, okay?

13:10.901 --> 13:12.901
She will swoon.
Trust me. Go.

13:12.934 --> 13:13.934
Okay.
You go.

13:13.968 --> 13:15.801
Thank you.
Yes, you're welcome.

13:15.834 --> 13:16.834
You're beautiful.

13:18.801 --> 13:20.001
Just go.

13:20.034 --> 13:21.701
No,
you got to go alone.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.767
Okay,
i'm just gonna... 

13:26.801 --> 13:28.834
What the fuck, julian?

13:28.867 --> 13:30.434
I'm crying.
Are you crying?

13:30.467 --> 13:32.400
Yeah.
What the fuck?!

13:32.434 --> 13:34.901
I'm the one fucking pushing out
a goddamn bowling ball

13:34.934 --> 13:37.867
Out of my pussy... 
my sweet, beautiful pussy

13:37.901 --> 13:39.534
That is never gonna
look the same again!

13:39.567 --> 13:41.200
<i>I should be crying!
You are crying.</i>

13:41.233 --> 13:43.701
I did have a pretty pussy,
didn't i, hank?

13:43.734 --> 13:45.734
Oh, my god, yes.
I mean, a beautiful pussy.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.867
I would put it in
the top 10 of pussies.

13:47.901 --> 13:49.634
I love
your pussy, too.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.200
Your p...  you know, not... 
no disrespect to yours.

13:52.233 --> 13:54.767
Karen...  number-One pussy
in the world, with a bullet.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.467
Fuck you.

14:07.367 --> 14:09.667
Lover!

14:09.701 --> 14:11.034
You home?

14:22.133 --> 14:24.801
Oh, yeah.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.434
<i>Charlie.</i>

14:26.467 --> 14:27.901
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

14:27.934 --> 14:30.767
<i>I know that look.
He's gonna blow.</i>

14:30.801 --> 14:33.068
<i>Slow it down, runkle.</i>

14:36.901 --> 14:38.968
<i>Forget it, jake.
It's vaginatown!</i>

14:40.367 --> 14:42.968
I know.
That's the only way... 

14:43.001 --> 14:45.200
Charlie,
what are you doing?

14:47.300 --> 14:48.334
I'm sorry.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.434
Can you just wait outside
for a second?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.300
Sure thing, babe.

14:57.001 --> 14:58.667
I'm sorry, baby.
I just... 

14:58.701 --> 15:01.867
I thought i was gonna be
by myself for a while, you know?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.100
I...  who's that?

15:03.133 --> 15:04.467
Oh, just a guy
from my groundlings class.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.634
We were gonna work on
a sketch.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.167
Oh, okay.
Wow. I'm really sorry.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.634
I just...  i thought i was gonna
have a few minutes to myself.

15:10.667 --> 15:11.901
Oh, it's okay.

15:11.934 --> 15:13.867
You know i'm totally fine
with you masturbating.

15:13.901 --> 15:17.968
It's just kind of weird
when you bring somebody over.

15:18.001 --> 15:22.667
I understand, and it's important
that we set these ground rules.

15:22.701 --> 15:24.434
Gus?

15:24.467 --> 15:25.534
Oh.

15:25.567 --> 15:28.200
Um, gus, this is
my lover, charlie.

15:28.233 --> 15:29.233
Gus, chuck runkle.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.233
Hey, charlie.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.534
Uh, should we start?

15:34.567 --> 15:35.634
Oh, fuck.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.534
Here it comes.
Woman: okay.

15:37.567 --> 15:38.701
Fuck.
Okay, it's time.

15:38.734 --> 15:40.901
Oh, yeah.
Breathe, breathe.

15:40.934 --> 15:43.267
Okay, go, sonja.
Go! Yes!

15:43.300 --> 15:44.500
Fuck!

15:47.567 --> 15:48.901
Push. Push!

15:48.934 --> 15:51.233
Oh, my god!

15:51.267 --> 15:53.167
Oh, look.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.767
What the fuck?!

15:56.968 --> 15:58.901
Boooooo-Ya!

15:58.934 --> 16:01.634
Baby is black!
Karen!

16:01.667 --> 16:03.767
Damn it, the baby's black.
You see that shit?!

16:03.801 --> 16:05.500
Goddamn it!
I didn't knock her up.

16:05.534 --> 16:07.534
I know!
I love you.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.034
I love you.
Ohh.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.500
Congratulations, mommy.

16:11.534 --> 16:14.934
Bathe the child,
and bring him to me.

16:14.968 --> 16:16.734
I forgot about
that fucking barista.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.801
He was so hot.
He looked like lenny kravitz.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.034
Fuck.

16:20.068 --> 16:22.567
I said, bathe the infant,
and bring him to me.

16:22.601 --> 16:23.701
Coming. Coming.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.734
Fuck, i forgot.
I'm sorry, hank.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.767
Yes.

16:28.801 --> 16:31.801
Oh, yes.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.200
I will raise... 

16:33.233 --> 16:36.567
This black baby
as my own.

16:36.601 --> 16:39.734
Before you drop him,
you fucking drunk, come here.

16:39.767 --> 16:43.367
I will raise this black baby
as my own.

16:44.801 --> 16:46.867
As my own.

16:46.901 --> 16:48.567
Yeah.

16:48.601 --> 16:49.968
Oh.

16:50.001 --> 16:53.334
He's beautiful.
Congratulations.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.567
He looks like me.
He doesn't
look like you.

16:58.334 --> 16:59.767
Hey, lover.

16:59.801 --> 17:00.767
Hey!

17:03.767 --> 17:05.068
How'd it go?

17:05.099 --> 17:06.068
Good.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.534
I think it's gonna be
really funny.

17:08.567 --> 17:10.567
Good. Good.

17:10.601 --> 17:12.434
I had sex with gus.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.400
What?

17:15.434 --> 17:17.233
I got confused.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.634
You got confused?
What the fuck does that mean?

17:19.666 --> 17:22.001
Well, i've never
done a scene like that before,

17:22.034 --> 17:24.767
And we got to the kissing part,
and i got all confused.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.001
My autopilot kicked in,
and i kissed him for real,

17:27.034 --> 17:29.200
And the next thing you know,
he was inside me.

17:29.233 --> 17:31.034
That sounds like rape.

17:31.068 --> 17:32.367
No, not really... 

17:32.400 --> 17:34.233
Unless he wants to
press charges.

17:34.267 --> 17:36.434
It felt good.
He had a really nice cock.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.567
Jesus christ, daisy!

17:38.601 --> 17:39.834
I'm sorry.

17:39.867 --> 17:41.167
Does that
make you feel bad?

17:41.200 --> 17:43.500
Yeah, it makes me feel bad!
It makes me want to throw up!

17:43.534 --> 17:45.767
Do you want me
to suck your dick?

17:45.801 --> 17:47.634
No!

17:48.867 --> 17:50.001
Yes.

17:50.034 --> 17:52.200
<i>I don't know.
Now i'm confused.</i>

17:52.233 --> 17:55.400
See?!
This is confusing stuff!

17:55.434 --> 17:57.200
Maybe we should
take a break.

17:57.233 --> 18:00.068
"Take a break"?!
I just left my wife for you!

18:00.100 --> 18:01.667
I didn't ask you to,
charlie!

18:01.701 --> 18:03.400
I know!

18:05.500 --> 18:09.034
It just... seemed incredibly
romantic at the time.

18:09.068 --> 18:10.467
It was.

18:10.500 --> 18:14.034
Maybe we should have some sex,
just fuck through the pain.

18:14.068 --> 18:17.034
O... kay.

18:17.068 --> 18:21.500
Okay, citizen,
fuck the gus out of me.

18:37.601 --> 18:40.701
Why didn't you
pinch me?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.567
Jesus! Woman!

18:46.601 --> 18:48.567
Uhh,
i'm tapping out.

18:49.767 --> 18:53.300
You had me looking for
the fucking rodeo clown.

18:53.334 --> 18:54.434
Really?

18:56.601 --> 18:58.100
Hey, you know what?

18:58.133 --> 19:01.300
I think you should come
to new york.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.701
Well.

19:07.267 --> 19:09.233
Why the change of heart?

19:09.267 --> 19:12.068
I can't live
without this.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.100
I thought
maybe it was 'cause

19:14.133 --> 19:15.968
You wanted to make
a black baby with me.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.100
No,
i just need a manny.

19:19.133 --> 19:20.601
Oh, i have
excellent references.

19:21.767 --> 19:26.133
Plus, my vagina's become
really attached to you.

19:26.167 --> 19:27.801
Not your heart?
Just your vag?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.467
Well,
it's tough if, you know,

19:29.500 --> 19:31.867
The heart and the vag
are not on the same page.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.701
But, you know what?
In this instance, they are.

19:34.734 --> 19:37.400
Well, that's terrific
because i am all about

19:37.434 --> 19:39.400
Improving heart/vag
relations, you know?

19:39.434 --> 19:40.400
It's my thing.

19:40.434 --> 19:42.200
So we're in sync.
Mm-Hmm.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.734
Should we
take advantage of that?

19:44.767 --> 19:45.901
Could...  could we... 

19:45.934 --> 19:47.100
Round two?
Yeah.

19:47.133 --> 19:49.434
I'm answering
the bell.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.901
You got five minutes,
runkle.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.400
You look beautiful.

19:55.434 --> 19:57.834
That's right,
motherfucker, i do.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.367
I've always
looked beautiful.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.634
That's true.
You have.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.934
Then why the fuck
did you have to go

20:02.968 --> 20:05.901
And stick your dick
into some skanky porno chick?

20:05.934 --> 20:07.634
I don't know.

20:07.667 --> 20:08.968
I got confused.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.068
You could've stayed
with me.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.601
You were number 19.

20:12.634 --> 20:15.834
There were 18 cocks
before you, charlie... 

20:15.867 --> 20:18.801
Not a ton,
not a rogues gallery,

20:18.834 --> 20:21.701
But enough to know
that i liked yours the best.

20:21.734 --> 20:24.601
Not the longest,
not the thickest,

20:24.634 --> 20:28.367
Little bit of english on it,
but it was mine...  all mine.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.233
And now you
and your cock

20:30.267 --> 20:32.667
Have betrayed me
for the last time.

20:32.701 --> 20:33.834
Don't go, marce.

20:33.867 --> 20:35.068
I'm already gone, baby.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.233
I was gone the moment

20:36.267 --> 20:38.500
That you said
you wanted to be with daisy.

20:38.534 --> 20:41.367
You said it out loud!
You can't take it back.

20:41.400 --> 20:46.267
Oh, and, uh... your friend
ronny praeger called.

20:46.300 --> 20:49.167
He said something about
intense video wanting to

20:49.200 --> 20:51.434
"Buy 'vaginatown'

20:51.467 --> 20:52.968
For a shitload of money."

20:53.001 --> 20:54.300
Really?

20:54.334 --> 20:55.534
That's good news.

20:55.567 --> 20:58.467
Oh, hells yeah.
It's great news... for me.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.300
What? You said
i could have everything.

21:02.334 --> 21:04.534
But don't worry your
pretty little head about it.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.068
We'll let my lawyer
figure it out.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.267
He's really good.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.834
Later, runkle.

21:14.834 --> 21:18.834
Where's my ipod?
I can't find my fucking ipod!

21:20.034 --> 21:21.767
Bec... 

21:21.801 --> 21:24.167
It's gonna be
a long trip.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.567
Yeah.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.601
What?

21:29.634 --> 21:31.934
Something pubescent
this way comes.

21:34.500 --> 21:37.667
Okay, i know
you hate me right now.

21:37.701 --> 21:38.834
I do.

21:38.867 --> 21:41.734
Okay, but i figured
i'd hate myself even more

21:41.767 --> 21:45.634
If i didn't, you know,
at least say goodbye.

21:47.734 --> 21:49.233
That's it?

21:49.267 --> 21:50.734
That's the best
you can do?

21:50.767 --> 21:53.034
Here,
i got you something.

21:55.934 --> 21:57.934
I put a playlist
on there... 

21:57.968 --> 22:00.534
Our playlist... 
the one we made out to... 

22:00.567 --> 22:02.167
All 17 songs.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.367
What?! 17 songs?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.233
That's a lot
of making out.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.601
Hank,
could you shut up?

22:07.634 --> 22:08.767
He said 17 songs.

22:08.801 --> 22:10.267
I still
loathe you.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.968
I know. I know.
And you have every right.

22:13.001 --> 22:15.200
I do feel like
i was unjustly seduced,

22:15.233 --> 22:17.267
But i know that doesn't
make it okay.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.300
Anyway, i just wish
you weren't leaving 'cause... 

22:21.233 --> 22:25.567
'Cause i...  i love you... 
becca moody.

22:25.601 --> 22:29.400
You're like the only
post-Punk, heavy-Metal chick

22:29.434 --> 22:32.068
Who's ever
truly rocked my world.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.801
Is it okay if we go upstairs
for a minute?

22:42.834 --> 22:44.100
Of course... 
no fucking way.

22:44.133 --> 22:46.133
No, no, no.
You take it out on the strand

22:46.167 --> 22:48.467
Where there are people,
and i'm watching you... 

22:48.500 --> 22:50.034
Eyes in the back
of my head.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.300
As always.

22:53.167 --> 22:55.167
Hey, damien.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.601
Well played.

22:56.634 --> 22:58.334
Big ups.

23:00.867 --> 23:03.367
You know, that was
a nice parental move.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.133
I...  yeah.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.534
I kind of... 

23:07.567 --> 23:09.267
I like the way
you handled that shit.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.068
That's right,
mothafuckah!

23:13.300 --> 23:17.968
I feel kind of bad
splitting them up right now.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.834
Well, then don't.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.767
What do you mean?

23:23.801 --> 23:25.801
You go. I stay.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.534
Are you crazy?

23:29.567 --> 23:31.701
What, you think
i'd leave becca behind?

23:31.734 --> 23:34.001
Well, i'm not gonna break her.
I promise.

23:34.034 --> 23:36.334
Well, hold on a second.
What about you?

23:36.367 --> 23:38.300
I mean,
you'd give up new york?

23:38.334 --> 23:40.634
For her, yeah.

23:40.667 --> 23:44.867
At the end of the day,
it's all about her.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.500
<i>It's always been about her.</i>

23:47.534 --> 23:51.001
What happens between us,
i can't fucking control.

23:51.034 --> 23:53.068
Lord knows
i've tried every which way.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.467
But what i can do

23:54.500 --> 23:57.701
Is be the absolute best
i can be for her.

23:57.734 --> 23:59.934
If i followed you
to new york,

23:59.968 --> 24:02.233
I'd just be
hoping against hope

24:02.267 --> 24:04.701
That we lived
happily ever after.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.133
Maybe we do.
Maybe we don't.

24:07.167 --> 24:10.634
But you got some shit
you got to do, lady.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.667
I think you should do it.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.734
I'll hold down the fort... 

24:15.767 --> 24:18.034
Keep her off the pole.

24:20.367 --> 24:22.500
Oh, jesus.

24:22.534 --> 24:26.100
I wish you hadn't
just said all that.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.767
Why?

24:27.801 --> 24:29.068
I don't know.

24:29.100 --> 24:32.901
'Cause, you know, it just
makes me love you even more.

24:32.934 --> 24:36.767
Yeah, well... 
that really can't be helped.

24:36.801 --> 24:38.500
I am me, after all.

24:48.068 --> 24:50.500
A quick one
while they're away?

24:50.534 --> 24:51.901
You're disgusting.

24:51.934 --> 24:53.434
Mm.

25:44.267 --> 25:47.367
Look, just because
it's you and me now, alone,

25:47.400 --> 25:50.133
Doesn't mean i'm gonna let you
get away with stuff.

25:50.167 --> 25:51.400
It's good.

25:51.434 --> 25:53.867
'Cause i'm not gonna let you
get away with stuff either.

25:53.901 --> 25:55.934
Oh, really? What are... 
what are you gonna do?

25:55.968 --> 25:57.068
I'm not scared of you.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.934
You're...  you're... 
you're very diminutive,

25:58.968 --> 26:01.068
You know,
and i know jujitsu.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.901
I can still
kick your ass.

26:02.934 --> 26:04.867
Yeah,
at "guitar hero," maybe.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.367
Hey.
Hey, yourself.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.834
Is this
your offspring?

26:09.867 --> 26:12.701
Yes, this is, uh,
this is becca, my daughter,

26:12.734 --> 26:14.034
And this is... 

26:15.601 --> 26:17.500
This is surfer girl.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.634
Hello,
surfer girl.

26:19.667 --> 26:21.068
It's michelle.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.034
My name
is michelle.
Okay.

26:23.068 --> 26:25.467
I'm gonna go check out
that head shop.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.467
I'll be watching.
N... 

26:27.500 --> 26:30.300
Eyes in back
of my head.

26:30.334 --> 26:31.334
Head shop.

26:31.367 --> 26:32.867
Oh, boy.

26:32.901 --> 26:34.901
Cute kid.

26:34.934 --> 26:36.334
She has her moments.

26:36.367 --> 26:39.567
So, michelle, huh?
That's...  that's interesting.

26:39.601 --> 26:41.901
You're disappointed,
aren't you?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.601
Well, you know,
i did kind of like not knowing.

26:44.634 --> 26:45.867
It was...  it was cool

26:45.901 --> 26:48.167
In a "last tango in paris"
kind of way.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.034
I think you mythologize me
just a little too much.

26:52.634 --> 26:55.068
You know,
i'm just a normal girl... 

26:55.100 --> 26:58.034
With normal wants
and needs.

26:58.068 --> 27:01.901
You know, i have been around
the block a time or two, lady,

27:01.934 --> 27:04.767
And there ain't
nothing normal about you.

27:04.801 --> 27:08.200
Aw, you're still the sweetest
guy i ever fucked and robbed.

27:08.233 --> 27:10.500
You know, i'd like nothing more
than to get high,

27:10.534 --> 27:13.167
Fuck you goofy, and indulge
your larcenous tendencies,

27:13.200 --> 27:19.167
But i have a, uh,
serious child-Raising... 

27:19.200 --> 27:20.167
Problem here.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.334
Look at that.

27:21.367 --> 27:23.901
I think she's... 
she's looking for a bong.

27:31.801 --> 27:33.934
And the dance
continues.

27:33.968 --> 27:35.133
So it does.

27:44.267 --> 27:45.601
She seems nice.

27:45.634 --> 27:48.200
I don't know if "nice"
is exactly the word.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.233
Have you been intimate
with her?

27:50.267 --> 27:52.634
Why do you got to
talk to me like that?!

27:52.667 --> 27:53.901
What?

27:53.934 --> 27:56.300
You're always up in my grill
about boys.

27:56.334 --> 27:59.734
Well, and up in your grill
i always will be. Count on it.

27:59.767 --> 28:01.001
Don't stop, okay?

28:01.034 --> 28:04.267
Even if i curse your name
on a semi-Daily basis.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.968
I wouldn't dream of it.
He gig.

28:07.001 --> 28:08.367
Hey.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.267
Oh.
What's this for?

28:11.300 --> 28:13.767
For staying.

28:13.801 --> 28:16.267
You're stuck
on the island now.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.034
And you did it for me.

28:18.068 --> 28:19.567
What are you
talking about?

28:19.601 --> 28:21.068
I like it here.
It's nice.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.300
The sun is chirping.
The birds are shining.

28:23.334 --> 28:26.567
The water's wet.
Life is good, sweetheart.

28:26.601 --> 28:28.100
Life is good.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
