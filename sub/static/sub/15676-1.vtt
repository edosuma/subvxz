WEBVTT

00:28.696 --> 00:30.731
(ethereal music)

00:37.305 --> 00:40.040
- [Radio Announcer] Smith to
Williams out to the three,
no good.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.343
Pervis rebounds, lay-up,
no good, no foul.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.677
Rebounded by Grant.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.181
That was a good call by
the officials.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.816
Oregon State back down
on the floor, this has

00:48.882 --> 00:50.851
been a 12 two run by Louisville.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.653
It's a close one.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.091
Back to Grant, Pervis
gets his hands on it.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.692
Ball on the floor, out of bounds

00:58.759 --> 01:00.728
off the leg of Grant from
Oregon State.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.896
With 4:32 to go, Louisville
has the ball.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.833
Ellison passes to Spencer
over to Smith back to Ellison.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.901
He shoots and the three is good.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.838
Louisville gets the lead.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.241
(gasping in pain)

01:14.074 --> 01:15.843
- Uh, just keep breathing.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.145
Doing great.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.513
- I am breathing!

01:22.416 --> 01:24.218
- [Radio Announcer] Ooh, Ellison
steals the ball from Payton

01:24.285 --> 01:26.086
passes to Payne and it's
up and in.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.456
- Yeah, that's right!

01:28.522 --> 01:29.157
- Patrick!

01:29.223 --> 01:30.023
- What?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.959
- Could you please just drive!

01:32.025 --> 01:33.026
- I'm driving!

01:33.093 --> 01:34.762
I'm telling you baby, one day

01:34.828 --> 01:38.666
that's gonna be our boy
out there, fans screaming.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.700
- Patrick!

01:39.767 --> 01:41.602
(horn blares)

01:41.669 --> 01:43.771
(gasping)

01:47.441 --> 01:50.010
You said he was gonna
be a big football star.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.745
- That too.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.616
He's gonna take that field.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.950
(groans)

01:57.017 --> 02:00.754
Just, yeah.

02:00.821 --> 02:01.589
Yeah.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.258
- [Radio Announcer]
The three is good!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.327
Never nervous Pervis
answers Oregon's call.

02:06.394 --> 02:09.297
There's a time out on the floor.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.898
- Keep breathing, we're
almost there, okay?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.666
- Hey honey, you're doing great.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.568
- If you want to just wait here
we'll get you when she's ready.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.170
- Okay.
- Hi, sweetheart!

02:16.237 --> 02:17.938
Good luck!

02:18.005 --> 02:19.240
How is she?

02:19.307 --> 02:20.474
- The doctors say she's doing
great.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.010
- Good, good, good, good.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.612
- Keep pushing, keep pushing!

02:24.678 --> 02:25.879
(yells)

02:27.181 --> 02:29.750
(panting)

02:31.785 --> 02:33.854
(grunting)

02:33.921 --> 02:35.689
(emotional music)

02:44.232 --> 02:46.500
(baby cries)

02:46.567 --> 02:48.636
- [Doctor] You have a son.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.677
- Patrick Henry Hughes.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.430
(knocks)

03:25.839 --> 03:27.575
- How's Mama doing?

03:27.641 --> 03:31.379
- She's good, they both are.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.981
The doctors are just running
their tests.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.521
- Sure are a lot of nurses in
there.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.723
- Ah, you gotta be careful
nowadays.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.459
Avoid all those crazy lawsuits.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.798
- Well I'm sure he's fine,
honey.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.636
- Good looking son you got
there.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.237
- Yeah.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.006
Yeah, he sure is.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.108
Grandpa.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.243
(chuckling)

04:21.028 --> 04:22.730
(sighs)

04:25.533 --> 04:27.901
- We discovered some anomalies.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.506
- What do you mean, anomalies?

04:32.573 --> 04:36.477
- Patrick Henry was born
with a rare condition.

04:36.544 --> 04:40.548
It's called bilateral
anophthalmia.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.585
He was born without eyes.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.187
- What?

04:47.254 --> 04:49.423
- There must be some...

04:49.490 --> 04:52.360
- The ultrasound said that he
was healthy.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.328
- I'm sorry.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.397
It's easily missed.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.732
I'm afraid there's more.

05:00.100 --> 05:05.238
We think Patrick was born
with some sort of dwarfism.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.608
His joints didn't form properly.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.678
With surgery, he should be
able to walk.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.979
(crying)

05:12.045 --> 05:16.350
But he still will have
limited mobility.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.753
I'm very sorry.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.392
I'll give you all some time.

05:32.199 --> 05:35.369
(crying)

05:41.942 --> 05:44.578
(baby fusses)

06:41.168 --> 06:42.770
(phone rings)

06:54.047 --> 06:55.516
- Histologic examination showed
us there's

06:55.583 --> 06:57.518
an absence of neuroectodermal
tissue.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.619
- Mhmm.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.854
- Now listen to this.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.723
In most cases, a prosthetic
eyeball is

07:02.790 --> 07:05.993
needed to prevent facial
dysmorphism.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.228
I mean, this medical
book is 353 pages long

07:08.295 --> 07:10.964
and I can barely find three
pages on his condition.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.700
And all the doctors have
an opinion,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.334
but they're never for sure.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.169
They never know for sure.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.940
I mean, look at him!

07:20.007 --> 07:24.578
Those braces are like some sort
of medieval torture device.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.315
- I don't know, Patricia.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.983
He...

07:30.050 --> 07:31.051
- Do you see this?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.554
The doctor showed me what
we have to do.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.389
We have to pry this into his eye

07:36.456 --> 07:39.126
socket to open it up,
his socket.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.530
And then we have to pry this
one in, and then this one.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.765
- Okay, look.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.800
It's better that we're
doing all this now, right?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.602
- The doctor said that
his eyes will

07:48.669 --> 07:53.040
bleed as we force these
into his skull.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.743
There's more surgeries,
severe bruising.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.778
I mean, it's torture!

08:01.582 --> 08:03.416
- I don't know what to tell you.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.585
I'm not a doctor.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.787
(kettle whistles)

08:10.658 --> 08:13.861
Oh man, I gotta go.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.264
Look, it's gonna be okay.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.070
(baby cries)

08:23.136 --> 08:24.905
- Shh.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.784
- Here we go.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.591
Here it is, here it is.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.425
- Nice!

08:45.492 --> 08:47.160
(clapping)

08:52.399 --> 08:53.634
- Come on, daddio.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.168
You're gonna be tying a lot more

08:55.235 --> 08:57.671
shoelaces and wiping a
lot more noses.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.439
- Nah,
Patricia does most of that.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.743
I try not to get my
hands too dirty.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.313
- I heard about Patrick Henry.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.215
I'm sorry, man.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.719
He's special needs?

09:11.785 --> 09:15.288
I'm just saying,
it's gotta be rough.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.323
- No, he's gonna come around.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.658
I mean, the doctors just haven't

09:17.725 --> 09:20.594
figured out how to fix him yet,
you know?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.316
(horn blares)

10:18.218 --> 10:19.887
(phone rings)

10:40.473 --> 10:43.110
- Mommy, what's wrong with him?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.421
- No, it's a motorcycle.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.823
(knocking)

10:56.323 --> 10:56.924
Hi.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.091
- How are you guys?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.827
- Good, good, yeah, good.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.695
- Great to hear.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.099
I'm sorry it took so
long to get back to you.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.605
- Hey, conference room?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.074
We need to go over
this proposal.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.876
- Yes sir.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.789
(phone rings)

11:42.335 --> 11:44.004
- Thank you.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.294
I tried calling you five
times today.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.831
- Okay?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.033
Sorry, I was busy.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.434
- You expect me to believe you

12:14.501 --> 12:15.969
were out of the
office that much?

12:16.036 --> 12:20.841
- It was a really busy
day, so yeah, I kinda do.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.945
Honey, I'm sorry.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.349
I'm not trying to make
you upset, it's just...

12:32.219 --> 12:33.453
(crying)

12:33.520 --> 12:35.388
Baby, I'm sorry.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.863
- He's never...

12:44.431 --> 12:46.433
He's never gonna walk.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.038
- What?

12:52.372 --> 12:55.275
- Dr. Rogers said he's
sorry, but...

12:55.342 --> 12:56.409
- No, no.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.911
Wait a minute,
what about the surgery?

12:57.978 --> 13:00.413
They said they could
fix his hips.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.917
If they just put his hips back
in the sockets or whatever.

13:03.984 --> 13:04.852
- He said it wouldn't work.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.187
He said it was not...

13:18.465 --> 13:20.300
- So that's it.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.304
He'll never walk.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.887
- Maybe it's for the best.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.058
- I'm sorry, what?

13:45.125 --> 13:48.095
- I'm just saying, he's
been through so much.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.197
Maybe it's best we stop
trying to force

13:50.263 --> 13:51.831
him into what we think
he should be.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.034
- Patricia, we are his parents.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.269
Shouldn't we be fighting for
whatever is best for him?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.571
- Is this what's best for him?

14:01.641 --> 14:02.910
(scoffs)

14:02.976 --> 14:05.778
Just say it.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.181
- Just say what?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.350
- You're disappointed.

14:10.417 --> 14:15.122
- I'm dis-, yeah, yeah
I'm very disappointed.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.423
Our son is never going to walk.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.426
- No, no, you are disappointed
that

14:19.492 --> 14:23.130
you didn't get your big
all star.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.198
And you're mad because
he's not the kind of kid

14:25.265 --> 14:26.666
you can brag about to
all your friends.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.069
Well, you know what?

14:29.136 --> 14:34.374
Patrick Henry may not be
progressing like normal kids,

14:34.441 --> 14:38.979
and he may never be
a star athlete or an

14:39.046 --> 14:43.516
astronaut or a brain surgeon,
and maybe

14:43.583 --> 14:47.454
he'll never reach the lofty
perch of being average.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.891
But I will tell you this.

14:53.160 --> 14:58.331
He will be everything
that God meant him to be.

15:02.702 --> 15:06.473
But I need to know that
you're with me.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.945
Because we're supposed
to be a team

15:12.012 --> 15:14.847
and right now it's just me.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.250
- Oh, it's just you?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.687
Why do you think I spend
all day every day at work?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.055
- I work too.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.724
You spend all your free
time away from us.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.126
- You know what?

15:26.193 --> 15:29.529
No, I'm not gonna sit
here and take this.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.333
I work to support this family.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.402
I want what is best for
him and I am not

15:35.468 --> 15:37.604
gonna sit here and let
you make me feel guilty.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.638
I'm fine.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.408
- No, Patrick, he needs you.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.710
And I need you.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.614
- Sweetheart, I know that.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.482
I'm right here.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.556
- It's seven o'clock.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.097
- Yeah,
I've got a game in 30 minutes.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.067
- Mhmm, I know.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.138
- We'll finish talking
about this later, then.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.145
(sniffs)

16:32.559 --> 16:33.693
(sighs)

16:40.700 --> 16:42.935
- I don't know, man.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.971
She's just so beautiful.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.206
I really think I love her.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.574
- Would you just ask
her out already?

16:47.640 --> 16:48.875
- Ah, it's just--

16:48.941 --> 16:50.910
- Come on man,
women are not that scary.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.312
- Patrick?

16:52.379 --> 16:54.547
Can you come inside please?

16:58.085 --> 17:00.153
Okay, so his food is
on the counter,

17:00.220 --> 17:01.521
here's his milk, and
just don't forget to--

17:01.588 --> 17:03.590
- Wait, what?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.358
- Girl's night?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.359
Now, don't forget to
feed him around six.

17:07.426 --> 17:08.828
I laid his pajamas out
on the bed and when

17:08.895 --> 17:09.695
you put him in the crib,
just be careful with his--

17:09.762 --> 17:11.498
Oh, okay.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.633
- And most importantly, just
don't forget to change his

17:13.700 --> 17:16.236
bandages over his eyes
before you put him to bed.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.106
- Fine, that's fine.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.384
- You good?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.153
- I got it.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.725
Have fun!

17:39.859 --> 17:40.693
(sighs)

17:40.760 --> 17:42.629
Come on, buddy.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.399
- Hand me a rag?

17:47.534 --> 17:50.370
- So, what do you know
about babies?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.076
- Could we get some
parmesan cheese?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.845
Thank you.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.382
- I'm worried.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.116
- Here, have some of
this fettuccine.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.051
Honey, it is delicious.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.387
- I'm afraid he's going
to burn the house down.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.088
- He'll be all right.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.224
Just be thankful you
only have one kid.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.726
God never gives us more
than we can handle.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.198
- I'm pregnant, Bev.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.937
- Trish, honey, that's great.

18:25.004 --> 18:25.938
Have you told him yet?

18:26.005 --> 18:28.141
- No, no.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.509
I'm scared of what he'll--

18:29.576 --> 18:30.810
- What?

18:30.877 --> 18:33.413
- What if this baby
has issues too?

18:33.480 --> 18:36.115
- Oh, Patricia, honey,
everyone has issues.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.185
- You know what I mean.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.689
I would be blessed to have
another Patrick Henry.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.526
I don't know if he
can handle it.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.899
- What are you gonna do?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.202
- Oh, drive.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.705
- Oh, nice shot!

19:00.807 --> 19:02.542
Is he asleep?

19:09.216 --> 19:11.651
Oh, dude, was that you?

19:11.718 --> 19:13.720
- No, was it...

19:16.756 --> 19:18.325
(both groan)

19:19.792 --> 19:23.430
Okay, here we go.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.733
Here we go.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.069
Oh.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.372
- Oh, man!

19:33.139 --> 19:35.375
Ah, that ain't right.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.177
Ah, I'm out.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.145
- Oh come on, Mike.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.281
It's not that bad.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.750
- [Mike] I'm going bowling!

19:43.816 --> 19:45.918
- I hate you.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.787
(crying)

19:54.594 --> 19:55.194
Ow!

19:55.262 --> 19:56.929
- Ow.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.370
- Come on.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.740
Try this, oh.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.678
(sighs)

20:13.413 --> 20:15.047
Daddy's had about
all he can take.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.949
It's time to go to bed.

20:19.352 --> 20:19.986
What?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.888
Bandages.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.824
(crying)

20:38.371 --> 20:40.072
Daddy's coming, buddy.

20:40.139 --> 20:40.873
(key plunks)

20:40.940 --> 20:42.675
(crying stops)

20:58.325 --> 21:00.693
You like that?

21:32.124 --> 21:34.694
(plays Fur Elise by Beethoven)

24:41.313 --> 24:43.115
- We need to talk.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.531
(sighs)

24:58.598 --> 25:01.768
Guess we're gonna have to
put another crib in here.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.040
Look, I'm sorry.

25:08.107 --> 25:11.978
I know I dropped a lot
on you last night.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.515
(plays xylophone)

25:20.286 --> 25:22.021
What are you thinking?

25:24.657 --> 25:26.859
- That you're right.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.228
He does look worse
than Muhammad Ali.

25:29.295 --> 25:34.667
- Yeah, well, you should try
seeing him like that every day.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.236
(plays xylophone)

25:39.271 --> 25:41.941
- You know,
he may not be an athlete.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.182
But he loves music.

25:57.256 --> 26:00.226
You wanna play a
little game with me?

26:00.292 --> 26:02.228
Play this game with me?

26:03.429 --> 26:06.833
Okay, all right.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.268
(plays note)

26:11.704 --> 26:15.241
(plays note that matches the
pitch of the kettle's whistle)

26:18.277 --> 26:21.480
(plays note that matches
the pitch of a car horn)

26:21.547 --> 26:25.151
(harmonizes with both pitches)

26:25.217 --> 26:28.855
(copies notes and rhythm)

26:36.428 --> 26:38.597
One two three.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.367
(copies notes)

26:45.604 --> 26:48.207
(emotional music)

29:38.244 --> 29:39.378
- Patrick?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.680
- You scared me, Dad.

29:41.747 --> 29:42.481
- What are you doing, buddy?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.884
- I got thirsty.

29:44.951 --> 29:48.855
Sorry, usually I can make it.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.824
- You want some help?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.026
- Yes.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.563
- [Cameron] Mom, I can't
find my church shoes!

29:57.629 --> 29:59.932
- Well, I didn't wear them last.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.100
Patrick, there are two pancakes

30:01.167 --> 30:02.969
on the plate in front of you.

30:03.035 --> 30:03.769
- Great, thanks.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.271
- Mom!

30:05.337 --> 30:06.538
- Cameron, did you hear
your mother?

30:06.605 --> 30:07.406
- How many do you want?

30:07.473 --> 30:08.307
- I'll take three.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.608
- Well, here's two.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.110
- Come on, I'm a growing boy.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.212
- Jesse, do we have to go
through this every Sunday?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.547
Stripes and plaid do not
go together, go change.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.283
- Yeah, Jesse.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.651
Stripes and plaids totally
don't go together, duh.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.554
- Ouch, blind kid showing
you up.

30:22.621 --> 30:23.589
- Patrick!

30:23.655 --> 30:24.523
- What?
- Yes?

30:24.590 --> 30:25.557
- No, not you Patrick.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.694
Don't antagonize 'em, honey.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.396
- [Cameron] Found 'em!

30:30.462 --> 30:32.398
- Now Patrick Henry,
have you figured out

30:32.464 --> 30:33.900
what you're going to
play at the Crusade yet?

30:33.966 --> 30:34.967
- Not yet.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.036
I'm still working on my song.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.370
- Will the whole world
see you on TV?

30:38.437 --> 30:38.770
- [Jesse] No, dumbo!

30:38.837 --> 30:40.672
- Jesse!

30:40.739 --> 30:43.275
- No, the Crusade for Children
is still a really big deal.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.611
Most of the state will
see you perform.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.379
- Better not screw up!

30:47.446 --> 30:49.949
- You're gonna do great.

30:50.016 --> 30:52.418
How's work coming?

30:52.484 --> 30:54.220
- I'm almost done.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.488
- Okay, we're ready to eat.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.224
- Great.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.663
- Let's say a prayer.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.798
- Right.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.467
Dear Lord.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.082
- Oh no, my eyes!

31:23.149 --> 31:24.250
- Patrick put your eyes
back in your head!

31:24.316 --> 31:25.751
- Patrick Henry Hughes?

31:25.817 --> 31:27.486
- Yes?

31:29.355 --> 31:31.590
- I am so sorry.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.892
- Right this way, Mr. Patrick.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.738
- Something wrong with it?

31:46.805 --> 31:49.075
- No, just changing the oil.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.810
- Hey, you know Patrick
really wants

31:51.877 --> 31:53.012
you to take him to the Crusade.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.713
Do you think you can take him?

31:54.780 --> 31:56.282
- Um, yeah.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.551
I need to shift some stuff
around, but I can do that.

32:02.821 --> 32:03.722
- We went to the doctor today.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.457
- [Patrick] How was it?

32:05.524 --> 32:10.529
- It was, could you come out
from under there, please?

32:12.564 --> 32:14.166
- Sure.

32:18.237 --> 32:23.675
- So, his scoliosis is
getting worse.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.311
He's gonna need surgery.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.545
- Great.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.014
Our insurance will cover it,
right?

32:28.080 --> 32:30.216
- Part of it, I don't know.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.850
I just don't know how much more

32:31.917 --> 32:33.485
I can bear seeing him
go through this.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.820
- Patrick's a pro.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.389
What is this, like,
his tenth surgery?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.125
- Eleventh.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.194
- He's gonna be fine.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.696
You need to stop worrying,
all right?

32:46.165 --> 32:48.100
He's gonna be okay.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.670
(emotional music)

33:21.367 --> 33:25.104
I heard you get what you
pray for

33:25.171 --> 33:26.605
One more time

33:29.575 --> 33:34.580
I got more yeah

33:36.715 --> 33:38.484
- Okay.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.552
- I have to follow up
Pam Tillis?

33:40.619 --> 33:41.987
- Oh, it'll be fine.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.021
- Do you think they'd
believe you

33:43.089 --> 33:44.590
if you said I passed out.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.125
- You're gonna be great.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.026
- Well thanks, but I'm
still scared out of my mind.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.595
- Really?

33:49.661 --> 33:51.029
Mom said you weren't
that nervous last night.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.598
- Yeah, well that was
last night.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.101
- Just, you know, picture
everybody in their underwear.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.435
- Dad.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.070
- You know what I mean,
you know. Just...

33:58.137 --> 34:00.706
- Dad, it's okay, just stop.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.076
- Listen.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.279
Just think about you and me,
in our

34:07.346 --> 34:10.516
living room, just the two of us,
okay?

34:10.581 --> 34:12.150
- Okay.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.087
- Listen, you know,
if you forget

34:15.154 --> 34:16.722
part of the song don't
worry about it.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.989
I'll be backstage beside ya.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.225
I can whisper the line
out to you.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.793
I've got all your lyrics
right here.

34:21.860 --> 34:22.960
- Did Mom do that?

34:23.027 --> 34:23.962
- Yeah.

34:24.029 --> 34:25.331
- Well thanks.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.766
It's good to know you're
there if I need you.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.435
- You won't.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.971
- How many people are out there,
Dad?

34:33.038 --> 34:34.072
- I'm not telling you.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.007
It's just you and me, remember?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.208
- Are you Patrick?

34:37.275 --> 34:38.310
- Yes I am.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.610
- You're on in two minutes.

34:39.678 --> 34:40.646
Are you ready?

34:40.712 --> 34:43.282
- I, I guess so.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.717
How many people does this
auditorium hold?

34:45.784 --> 34:48.353
- 825.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.222
Terry Meiners is
introducing you.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.623
- The guy from the radio?

34:51.690 --> 34:52.491
- Yeah.

34:52.558 --> 34:53.159
- Wow.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.159
- Here we go.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.496
- Patrick Henry Hughes.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.198
It is so good to meet you.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.400
I've heard so much about you.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.801
- Hi.

35:02.868 --> 35:03.769
- He's a big fan.

35:03.835 --> 35:04.703
- Oh.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.504
- It's great to meet you.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.772
- Oh, you too.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.374
Is it your first time
to perform--

35:08.440 --> 35:09.975
- We gotta go, Pat, come on.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.510
- Oh hey, you'll be great.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.745
Just go out there and have fun.

35:13.812 --> 35:14.746
- Thank you.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.515
- Do good!

35:19.251 --> 35:20.986
- It's just you and me, buddy.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.588
(applause)

35:22.654 --> 35:24.356
- As you know,
the Crusade for Children

35:24.423 --> 35:27.626
helps many kids all throughout
the Kentuckiana area.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.862
Kids with all sorts of
disabilities, or in the way

35:30.929 --> 35:34.366
Patrick Henry Hughes likes
to put it, abilities.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.868
Tonight, Patrick Henry
is here to share

35:36.935 --> 35:39.771
some of those very special
abilities with you.

35:39.838 --> 35:43.008
Give it up for
Patrick Henry Hughes.

35:43.074 --> 35:43.575
(applause)

35:43.875 --> 35:44.376
- Go Patrick!

35:44.443 --> 35:45.143
- Where is he?

35:45.211 --> 35:46.645
I don't see him.

35:46.712 --> 35:47.913
- Oh, they haven't cut
to him yet.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.315
Oh there, there he is
right there!

35:49.381 --> 35:50.449
Oh my gosh!

35:50.516 --> 35:52.618
- Okay, okay sh sh sh.

35:57.022 --> 35:58.490
(plays note)

36:00.226 --> 36:02.894
- Terry, did you move the piano?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.164
I'd like to play a little
song I wrote

36:06.232 --> 36:08.867
called The Crusade Cannonball.

36:13.539 --> 36:17.243
Here is to the Crusade
of the WHAS

36:17.309 --> 36:21.179
To all of you who donate
you know you are the best

36:21.247 --> 36:22.581
You really show that we are

36:22.648 --> 36:25.183
Part of the greatest
event of all

36:25.251 --> 36:27.085
The way we open up our hearts

36:27.152 --> 36:29.921
For the Crusade Cannonball

36:29.988 --> 36:33.859
To the folks at Louisville
Ladder and the CJ people too

36:33.925 --> 36:36.695
The Archdiocese of
Louisville and the Jefferson

36:36.762 --> 36:38.897
(clapping)

36:38.964 --> 36:41.433
(triumphant music swells)

37:03.054 --> 37:04.456
- Nailed it!

37:04.523 --> 37:06.925
- Yeah you did, that crowd
was going nuts over you.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.194
- Oh, I heard 'em.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.062
Whoo, yeah!

37:11.129 --> 37:14.600
- Keep all limbs and body
parts inside the vehicle.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.234
- Okay.

37:19.204 --> 37:21.740
(emotional music)

37:44.696 --> 37:48.033
- All right Patrick, you ready?

37:48.099 --> 37:49.167
- Yes.

37:49.234 --> 37:50.436
- I know you'll do great.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.037
We're gonna give you
some medicine

37:52.103 --> 37:54.840
that's gonna make you
feel really sleepy.

37:58.310 --> 38:01.146
All right,
let's move him into surgery.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.414
- [Patricia] I love you,
Patrick.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.915
- I love you.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.753
- [Patrick] Hang in there
buddy, we'll see you soon.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.590
(rapid beeping)

38:13.625 --> 38:16.061
- [PA System] Dr. Spitz
to the OR for prep please.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.696
(phone rings)

38:19.197 --> 38:20.999
(coughing)

38:27.138 --> 38:28.073
- Patrick?

38:28.139 --> 38:30.376
Patrick, can you hear me?

38:35.947 --> 38:37.115
- There he is.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.217
- You did such a great job,
sweetie.

38:39.284 --> 38:39.985
- That was it?

38:40.051 --> 38:41.653
- That's it.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.189
Doctor said everything went
just like it was supposed to.

38:44.255 --> 38:45.891
- How're you feeling, sweetie?

38:45.957 --> 38:47.593
- Thirsty.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.128
- Sandy here should be able
to get you some ice chips.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.530
Recovery's gonna take some time,

38:51.597 --> 38:53.399
but we'll just have to watch
and make sure

38:53.465 --> 38:55.266
you're on your way to getting
big and strong again, okay?

38:55.333 --> 38:55.801
- Sounds good.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.469
- All right.

38:57.536 --> 39:00.338
I'll be back to check
on you later tonight.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.608
- Thank you, doctor.

39:02.674 --> 39:07.846
- Oh, oh, Granny wanted
me to give you something.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.615
Feel that?

39:10.582 --> 39:12.017
- Mom, that's great.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.284
Is she here?

39:13.351 --> 39:14.486
- No, she's gonna come
back later.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.921
You can thank them then.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.990
- And here is a whole
bunch of extra batteries.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.593
That should keep you busy for,
what?

39:21.660 --> 39:23.061
A couple hours?

39:23.128 --> 39:23.829
(knocking)

39:23.895 --> 39:25.497
- Patrick?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.466
We're gonna need to run
a few more tests.

39:27.533 --> 39:28.900
Would you all mind giving
us the room?

39:28.967 --> 39:30.235
- Yeah, of course.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.770
All right buddy, we'll be back.

39:31.837 --> 39:32.337
- Bye.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.005
- Bye.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.242
- Hey, are you good?

39:37.308 --> 39:38.343
- Yeah.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.412
- Great, 'cause I'll be back in

39:40.479 --> 39:41.480
a couple of hours, all right?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.148
- Where you going?

39:43.214 --> 39:44.683
- I've just got a few
things to take care of.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.985
- I thought you got off
work so you could be here.

39:47.052 --> 39:51.457
- I did, but I've still got
stuff to do.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.459
- Really?

39:53.525 --> 39:55.927
- Yeah, I'll be back as
quick as I can.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.863
I'm sorry.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.831
- Great.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.269
- I'll be back to check
on you later.

40:04.335 --> 40:05.403
- Thank you very much.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.506
- You're welcome.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.420
(plays note)

40:33.532 --> 40:35.501
- What are you doing?

40:35.567 --> 40:38.136
I thought you were supposed
to go back to the hospital and
be with Patrick!

40:38.203 --> 40:39.905
- Don't worry, my
parents are watching him.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.340
- Listen,
I know that you need your time,

40:42.407 --> 40:43.609
but if you haven't noticed
your son is in the hospital.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.076
And your other sons are trying

40:45.143 --> 40:46.712
to pretend they live
normal lives.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.614
Now I am trying to hold this
family together and I can't.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.215
Not by myself.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.151
What is that?

40:54.486 --> 40:56.221
- I sold my car.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.028
- I'm sorry.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.930
- Everything's gonna
be all right.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.332
Look I should get back
to the hospital.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.701
I'm sure my dad's
getting restless.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.574
It's okay.

41:29.621 --> 41:32.190
(marching band plays)

41:34.392 --> 41:35.927
- Where's that big knife?

41:35.994 --> 41:38.429
- It's in the utensil
drawer where it always is.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497
- Would you all please be quiet?

41:39.565 --> 41:41.166
I'm trying to record the band.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.233
- What?

41:42.300 --> 41:44.636
I can't hear you, where is it?

42:00.719 --> 42:02.020
- I'm back, got the eggs.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.755
- Sh!

42:05.223 --> 42:07.693
- Don't you think we're too
big for Easter egg hunts?

42:07.759 --> 42:10.662
- Okay, if you're too
old for candy.

42:10.729 --> 42:11.496
- You need some help?

42:11.563 --> 42:13.565
- Guys!

42:18.403 --> 42:20.538
Got it!

42:20.606 --> 42:22.808
- Good to finally have you home,
Patrick.

42:22.874 --> 42:26.745
- Yeah, I certainly don't
miss the hospital food.

42:26.812 --> 42:29.047
- Hey, when do we eat?

42:29.114 --> 42:32.918
- The ham's still gonna need
another 30 minutes or so.

42:32.984 --> 42:34.986
- Hey, how about some fresh air?

42:35.053 --> 42:36.688
It's a beautiful day out there.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.790
- Oh yeah.

42:43.428 --> 42:44.395
- Come on, Cameron.

42:44.462 --> 42:45.363
- Let me on there!

42:45.430 --> 42:47.265
- No, I was here first.

42:47.332 --> 42:49.635
- Take it easy, boys!

42:51.569 --> 42:54.740
- Table is all set,
anything else?

42:54.806 --> 42:59.510
- Oh, move, move, move,
move, hot, hot, hot, hot!

42:59.577 --> 43:00.411
Well, that does look nice.

43:00.478 --> 43:01.613
- Yeah, it does.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.513
- Can you get everybody
a napkin?

43:02.580 --> 43:03.181
(fire alarm beeps)

43:03.248 --> 43:03.682
- Oh no!

43:03.749 --> 43:04.883
- What?

43:04.950 --> 43:06.818
- Oh no!

43:07.518 --> 43:09.855
- Oh, oh no!

43:12.023 --> 43:16.494
No, no, not into the sink,
not the sink!

43:16.561 --> 43:18.263
- Patrick.

43:20.031 --> 43:22.834
- I always hated sweet
potatoes anyway?

43:22.901 --> 43:24.569
- I worked all day on
that thing.

43:24.636 --> 43:27.472
I must have left it in the
oven too long, darn it.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.841
- Ma, it'll be all right.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.710
- Yes, I'm all right.

43:31.777 --> 43:34.045
- [Jesse] Mom, Dad, help!

43:37.683 --> 43:39.017
- Dad, it...

43:39.084 --> 43:40.018
- What happened?

43:40.085 --> 43:42.087
- The swing.

43:42.153 --> 43:42.921
- The rope broke.

43:42.988 --> 43:44.690
- Dad, Dad, my leg, my back!

43:44.756 --> 43:46.291
- It's okay buddy.

43:46.357 --> 43:47.492
Just take it easy.

43:47.558 --> 43:48.393
Dad, you're all right?

43:48.459 --> 43:49.695
- Stay with Patrick.

43:49.761 --> 43:51.162
- Patrick,
can you move your toes?

43:51.229 --> 43:52.097
- Think so.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.231
- What have you done?

43:53.298 --> 43:54.499
- Cameron, you shouldn't
have told

43:54.565 --> 43:56.434
Granddad to put him
on the swing!

43:56.501 --> 43:57.302
- How was this my fault?

43:57.368 --> 43:58.303
It just broke!

43:58.369 --> 44:00.138
- Quiet, everybody quiet!

44:01.873 --> 44:04.175
It was an accident.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.410
Patricia, please.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.412
Pull the van around front.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.749
Thank you.

44:10.816 --> 44:12.350
Okay, Patrick?

44:12.417 --> 44:13.719
Just hang in there.

44:13.785 --> 44:15.286
We're gonna try and move you,
all right?

44:15.353 --> 44:16.855
- Okay.

44:42.814 --> 44:45.416
- Oh, you're home.

44:46.885 --> 44:48.553
How are you?

44:48.619 --> 44:50.155
- I'm sore.

44:50.221 --> 44:53.925
- You should see yourself,
a big red fighting machine.

44:53.992 --> 44:56.061
- He has a compound fracture
in his leg.

44:56.127 --> 44:59.664
He's gonna be in that
cast for eight weeks.

44:59.731 --> 45:01.900
- Patrick, I am so sorry.

45:01.967 --> 45:04.402
- It's fine, Grandpa.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.837
- It was an accident, Dad.

45:05.904 --> 45:06.838
- I know, but--

45:06.905 --> 45:07.873
- You know what?

45:07.939 --> 45:09.407
It's late, we're all tired.

45:09.474 --> 45:10.675
Let me give you a ride home.

45:10.742 --> 45:11.642
- No, I'll be okay.

45:11.709 --> 45:12.477
- Yeah?

45:12.543 --> 45:14.279
- I'll be okay.

45:17.382 --> 45:18.716
- I'm so sorry, honey.

45:18.784 --> 45:19.885
- How am I supposed to practice

45:19.951 --> 45:23.621
with this stupid battering ram?

45:23.688 --> 45:26.491
- Okay, all right, you ready?

45:26.557 --> 45:28.827
One, two, three.

45:31.897 --> 45:34.866
Careful, careful.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.508
- What am I gonna do?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.582
- Can't wait to see the bill
for this little adventure.

45:51.649 --> 45:52.984
- I feel so bad for him.

45:53.051 --> 45:54.853
I mean, eight weeks really
is a long time.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.187
- Yeah, but he'll be okay.

45:56.254 --> 45:59.290
- But he can't play piano
with that cast.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.927
Honey, we should have
been watching him closer.

46:01.993 --> 46:03.228
- We can't always protect him.

46:03.294 --> 46:04.830
When I was his age,
I got beat up,

46:04.896 --> 46:06.464
scraped, bruised,
the whole nine yards.

46:06.531 --> 46:07.933
I survived.

46:07.999 --> 46:09.767
- Did your parents know
every doctor in town?

46:09.835 --> 46:11.102
'Cause I think I do.

46:11.169 --> 46:13.504
- [Patrick] Mom, Dad, come here!

46:15.040 --> 46:16.407
- What's wrong?

46:16.474 --> 46:17.342
- Trumpet.

46:17.408 --> 46:18.276
- What?

46:18.343 --> 46:19.777
- I can play trumpet.

46:19.845 --> 46:21.246
- What are you talking about?

46:21.312 --> 46:22.313
- Well you guys are
always saying

46:22.380 --> 46:23.648
how I shouldn't think about my

46:23.714 --> 46:26.417
disabilities, but my abilities,
right?

46:26.484 --> 46:28.753
And I was thinking,
I can't play violin

46:28.820 --> 46:30.956
or guitar because my arms
are too short

46:31.022 --> 46:33.224
and I can't play piano
right now because of my leg,

46:33.291 --> 46:35.927
but look, I can play trumpet.

46:35.994 --> 46:37.595
- Hey, you know what?

46:37.662 --> 46:40.565
That's great, but we've
all had a really long day

46:40.631 --> 46:43.068
and we should probably
focus on getting some sleep.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.502
- Mom, don't you see it's great?

46:44.569 --> 46:46.704
- We'll talk about it
in the morning.

46:46.771 --> 46:49.740
But yes, I think it's great.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.010
- Okay, good.

46:52.844 --> 46:53.744
- We don't have a trumpet.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.080
- So, we will get one.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.548
- You guys do realize
I can hear you.

46:57.615 --> 46:59.050
- Don't worry about it, Patrick.

46:59.117 --> 47:01.586
It'll work out,
you just get some sleep.

47:01.652 --> 47:02.520
- Mom?

47:02.587 --> 47:03.688
- Yeah.

47:03.754 --> 47:06.925
- Quit worrying about me,
I'm fine.

47:06.992 --> 47:07.926
I gotta get out there.

47:07.993 --> 47:10.728
How else am I gonna learn?

47:10.795 --> 47:12.697
- We just want to keep you safe.

47:12.763 --> 47:15.266
- Well I love you too, Mom.

47:16.902 --> 47:18.836
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.242
- Goodnight, buddy.

47:24.309 --> 47:26.077
- Goodnight Dad.

47:28.479 --> 47:31.182
- And now we need to find
the money for a trumpet.

47:31.249 --> 47:32.951
- I'll make some calls.

47:33.018 --> 47:34.685
- [Patrick] I can still
hear you!

47:34.752 --> 47:36.454
(laughing)

47:38.789 --> 47:40.892
(phone rings)

47:48.833 --> 47:50.635
- Hey, Patrick.

47:54.572 --> 47:57.042
Those reports will be on
my desk by Monday morning?

47:57.108 --> 47:59.310
- Yes sir, they will be.

48:00.278 --> 48:03.014
- Have a nice weekend.

48:03.081 --> 48:04.649
- You too.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.919
(phone rings)

48:13.824 --> 48:14.625
Hey buddy.

48:14.692 --> 48:16.227
- Hey.

48:16.294 --> 48:21.499
- So, your mom called some
of our old college friends.

48:25.670 --> 48:28.573
It'll do for now.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.576
- Oh wow, thank you!

48:31.642 --> 48:33.011
- You're welcome.

48:34.112 --> 48:35.313
Now I can finally tell
your granddad

48:35.380 --> 48:38.249
that my music major's
paying off.

48:39.517 --> 48:41.686
Now when you're ready,
when you blow

48:41.752 --> 48:43.254
into it, you're gonna want to

48:43.321 --> 48:45.957
keep your lips really tight,
okay?

48:46.024 --> 48:48.026
- Okay.

48:53.298 --> 48:55.366
(trumpet splutters)

48:57.235 --> 49:00.438
- We'll work on that.

49:00.505 --> 49:02.173
Here we go!

49:02.907 --> 49:04.976
Oh and the pass is good!

49:05.043 --> 49:07.545
- I so had that.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.747
- Oh come on Dad,
that was right to you.

49:09.814 --> 49:10.681
- He's getting old.

49:10.748 --> 49:12.350
- Hey now.

49:15.153 --> 49:17.088
Hey Jesse?

49:17.155 --> 49:18.523
Go grab the ladder from
behind the garage.

49:18.589 --> 49:19.224
Let's fix that swing.

49:19.290 --> 49:20.825
(trumpet splutters)

49:20.891 --> 49:21.759
(sighs)

49:21.826 --> 49:23.028
- Trumpet, Dad?

49:23.094 --> 49:25.063
Really?

49:25.963 --> 49:26.998
- So put down one?

49:27.065 --> 49:27.798
- Right, relax your fingers.

49:27.865 --> 49:28.266
Relax.

49:28.566 --> 49:29.400
- Okay.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.337
- Good, okay, all right?

49:33.904 --> 49:36.107
(plays note)

49:36.907 --> 49:38.176
That's pretty good!

49:38.243 --> 49:42.647
(plays scale)

49:46.817 --> 49:51.322
Oh, he's at the 15, the
10, the five, touchdown!

49:53.024 --> 49:56.461
(plays along with fight song)

49:56.527 --> 49:58.563
- [All] Go Cards!

49:58.629 --> 50:00.565
- Why are you watching
this game again?

50:00.631 --> 50:02.600
- It's a VHS classic.

50:04.001 --> 50:07.072
Oh, this is where coach
throws his hat.

50:17.315 --> 50:20.385
(smashing, shattering)

50:32.797 --> 50:34.532
- Mom!

50:35.666 --> 50:37.402
- What in the?

50:38.703 --> 50:41.472
Ah, Patrick!

50:42.907 --> 50:44.575
- I'm fine, Mom, don't worry.

50:44.642 --> 50:48.313
- Well, it's more than
I can say for this lamp!

50:48.379 --> 50:50.215
- Tomorrow's the big day.

50:50.281 --> 50:52.117
- Trust me, I know.

50:52.183 --> 50:55.386
- Hey, you try having your
leg like this.

50:58.523 --> 51:01.126
(phones ringing)

51:01.192 --> 51:03.094
- Have a good one, guys.

51:12.203 --> 51:13.671
Hey guys, I'm home.

51:13.738 --> 51:14.705
- Dad, you're home early.

51:14.772 --> 51:15.773
- Oh, milkshakes.

51:15.840 --> 51:16.674
- Oh boy!

51:16.741 --> 51:17.475
- Thank you so much.

51:17.542 --> 51:18.909
- You're welcome.

51:18.976 --> 51:20.911
- All right, I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.079
You're gonna get Jesse at four?

51:22.147 --> 51:23.714
- And Cameron at 3:40, I got it.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.116
- All right,
I'll take this for the road.

51:25.183 --> 51:26.083
You guys have a good day.

51:26.151 --> 51:27.017
- [Patrick] Bye Mom!

51:27.084 --> 51:28.486
- Bye!

51:29.220 --> 51:31.189
Here, hold those for me.

51:31.256 --> 51:32.657
- Okay.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.563
- So, Mike's taking a
book out of his book bag,

51:38.629 --> 51:40.965
I switch pens with him,
and then Donovan

51:41.031 --> 51:45.436
who's all hunched over
and, man that guy was old.

51:45.503 --> 51:50.341
He goes, everybody,
hold up your pens,

51:50.408 --> 51:52.843
and then he starts
shuffling around the room.

51:52.910 --> 51:57.515
Scanning from hand to hand
with his beady little eyes.

51:57.582 --> 52:01.186
And then he comes up
behind Mike and (claps)

52:01.252 --> 52:04.322
he smacks Mike on the
back of the head so hard,

52:04.389 --> 52:06.224
gave him two weeks of jug.

52:06.291 --> 52:07.892
- What'd Mike say to you?

52:07.958 --> 52:09.794
- What are you kidding me?
I didn't tell him.

52:09.860 --> 52:10.795
- You didn't tell him?

52:10.861 --> 52:12.230
Dad, you guys are friends.

52:12.297 --> 52:13.798
- Yes, and I would like
to keep it that way.

52:13.864 --> 52:17.868
The point is, high school is
actually a lot of fun,

52:17.935 --> 52:19.604
and you're gonna do fine.

52:19.670 --> 52:22.106
And you should be glad
that the educational

52:22.173 --> 52:24.642
system has progressed since
the 1970s.

52:24.709 --> 52:27.278
- No, I just can't wait to
get this cast off my leg.

52:27.345 --> 52:28.946
- Yeah, ten o'clock, right?

52:29.013 --> 52:30.147
- Yep, ten a.m..

52:30.215 --> 52:31.249
- Well I will be there.

52:31.316 --> 52:32.717
I look forward to watching them

52:32.783 --> 52:35.686
saw that huge thing
off your leg.

52:37.755 --> 52:38.456
- Ow!

52:38.523 --> 52:39.224
- You okay?

52:39.290 --> 52:41.359
- Brain freeze!

52:43.228 --> 52:44.595
(phone ringing)

52:44.662 --> 52:47.332
- Good morning, sir.
You wanted to see me?

52:47.398 --> 52:50.735
- Yes, please, shut the door.

52:54.972 --> 52:56.674
Take a seat.

53:02.247 --> 53:03.648
You're late.

53:03.714 --> 53:06.083
- Yes sir, I know, I was
with Patrick this morning.

53:06.150 --> 53:08.419
- It's the second time
this week.

53:08.486 --> 53:09.554
- Yes sir,
it's just that I've been

53:09.620 --> 53:11.456
juggling a lot lately and--

53:11.522 --> 53:13.758
- Maybe I'm not making
myself clear.

53:13.824 --> 53:16.961
I need you here all day
every day.

53:17.027 --> 53:21.532
Get your work done and please
get your priorities straight.

53:23.334 --> 53:24.302
- Sir, I--

53:24.369 --> 53:28.773
- Look, Patrick, I like you.

53:28.839 --> 53:33.578
Always have, but you're
making me look bad.

53:33.644 --> 53:37.214
Now go and do the work
that I hired you to do.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.251
- Yes sir.

53:40.318 --> 53:41.586
I understand.

53:41.652 --> 53:43.754
- Good.

53:43.821 --> 53:45.590
That'll be all.

53:49.994 --> 53:52.697
(phones ringing)

53:54.399 --> 53:58.202
- No I know, tell him I'm sorry,
okay?

53:58.269 --> 54:00.771
Yeah all right,
I'll see you later.

54:06.311 --> 54:07.111
- Your dad said he was--

54:07.177 --> 54:08.946
- I know, I heard.

54:11.582 --> 54:16.387
- Hey, you're finally free
of that big ugly cast!

54:16.454 --> 54:19.256
- Mhmm, I know.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.761
(motorcycle engine rumbles)

54:27.332 --> 54:28.833
- What are you smiling about?

54:28.899 --> 54:29.734
- Nothing.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.369
- What?

54:32.236 --> 54:34.539
- That just sounds so cool.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.462
What are you doing?

54:57.528 --> 55:01.165
- Just wait here, be right back.

55:01.231 --> 55:02.833
- Okay.

55:11.776 --> 55:13.478
- Hey you.

55:14.244 --> 55:16.747
I got a favor to ask.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.758
- Woo!

55:35.866 --> 55:38.335
(emotional music)

56:11.702 --> 56:13.337
- I guess it's inevitable.

56:13.404 --> 56:15.239
- It's just high school,
Mom, I'll live.

56:15.305 --> 56:18.075
- I just hate to see my
little boy grow up so fast.

56:18.142 --> 56:19.343
- I'm excited.

56:19.410 --> 56:21.045
It's gonna be fine.

56:21.111 --> 56:23.013
- You sound like your dad.

56:26.116 --> 56:29.587
- Hi, I'm Mr. Howard your
vision teacher.

56:29.654 --> 56:30.755
You must be Patrick.

56:30.821 --> 56:32.322
- Hello, it's great to meet you.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.257
- It's great to meet you.

56:33.323 --> 56:33.958
You ready to go to class?

56:34.024 --> 56:34.492
- Yeah.

56:34.559 --> 56:34.825
- All right.

56:36.226 --> 56:38.896
- Oh, okay, well, you
guys have a good day.

56:38.963 --> 56:40.665
- We will!

56:40.731 --> 56:41.331
Bye Mom.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.667
- Bye honey.

56:42.733 --> 56:45.102
- So I hear you like music.

56:45.169 --> 56:46.904
- Yes.

56:58.282 --> 57:00.417
(chatter)

57:03.688 --> 57:05.089
- I'm gonna go get some lunch.

57:05.155 --> 57:07.124
I'll be right back in a
couple of minutes, okay?

57:07.191 --> 57:07.925
- Sounds good.

57:07.992 --> 57:09.727
- All right.

57:15.232 --> 57:16.200
- Hello.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.735
- Hey.

57:19.203 --> 57:20.905
So you're blind?

57:20.971 --> 57:24.308
- Well my eyeballs are glass,
so yeah.

57:24.374 --> 57:27.645
Why are you waving your
hand in front of my face?

57:27.712 --> 57:29.614
- Man, I thought you said you
were blind.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.917
- I can hear your sleeve moving.

57:32.983 --> 57:35.653
- I mean, I guess it's
cool to chill all day,

57:35.720 --> 57:37.488
and let other people do
stuff for you.

57:37.555 --> 57:39.557
- I try and do what I can
for myself.

57:39.624 --> 57:43.260
Everything's impossible until
you try it.

57:43.327 --> 57:45.329
- Why don't you try to walk?

57:45.395 --> 57:47.097
(laughing)

57:47.965 --> 57:49.133
- Why don't you try and jump off

57:49.199 --> 57:51.101
a roof and fly like a superhero?

57:51.168 --> 57:52.770
(laughing)

57:56.140 --> 57:57.575
- What'd you say your name
was again?

57:57.642 --> 57:59.610
- Patrick.

58:00.545 --> 58:01.579
- Well I'm Bryce.

58:01.646 --> 58:04.114
- It's nice to meet you, Bryce.

58:04.181 --> 58:06.450
- Nice to meet you, man.

58:06.517 --> 58:08.686
So I'll see you around?

58:08.753 --> 58:10.387
- Sounds great.

58:10.454 --> 58:12.256
- Cool.

58:17.928 --> 58:19.129
- Everything all right?

58:19.196 --> 58:21.165
- Oh yeah, everything's great.

58:21.231 --> 58:23.668
- Those guys were giving
you some weird looks.

58:23.734 --> 58:25.335
- Bryce seemed nice.

58:25.402 --> 58:29.006
I guess I've never really
been big on nonverbals.

58:31.709 --> 58:34.278
- The data from crossection B...

58:34.344 --> 58:36.781
(emotional music)

58:51.095 --> 58:53.363
- Yo, whassup Pat?

58:53.430 --> 58:54.431
- Oh, hey Bryce.

58:54.498 --> 58:55.265
- What's up, man?

58:55.332 --> 58:56.266
What you up to?

58:56.333 --> 58:57.735
- Just sitting.

58:57.802 --> 58:59.770
(emotional music)

59:34.672 --> 59:37.541
- Dude, it's what you see all
the time.

59:37.608 --> 59:38.408
- What is it I see?

59:38.475 --> 59:40.210
I sure don't know.

59:40.277 --> 59:43.013
- It's just black.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.616
- Okay, imagine that
you're looking

59:45.683 --> 59:47.852
at something with your elbow.

59:47.918 --> 59:49.553
- Yeah, that ain't happening.

59:49.620 --> 59:54.058
- Exactly, I can't see
black, white, light, dark,

59:54.124 --> 59:58.028
red, blue, green, any of that.

59:58.095 --> 59:59.129
- Sorry, bro.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:00.364
- It's fine.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.634
It's not about what you
see, but how you see it.

01:00:07.672 --> 01:00:09.740
Are you all right?

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:12.442
- You ever thought about
joining the marching band?

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:13.410
- What?

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:15.179
When?

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.081
- Right.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:19.483
They're having marching
band auditions.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.218
- Well I can't march.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.554
- But you're good at
music stuff, though.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.256
- Yeah.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:28.225
- I'd take you.

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:31.195
- Well, maybe.

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:34.699
- They're this afternoon.
What you got to lose?

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:37.301
- So, what instrument do
you play?

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.903
- Trumpet.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.771
- Are you any good?

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:43.674
- Well my dad taught
me to play from memory.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:53.784
(plays alternating notes)

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.494
- Now you try.

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:05.195
- Okay.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:07.131
- Okay.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:14.371
(plays intricate notes)

01:01:23.881 --> 01:01:26.683
(drumming)

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:52.843
(marching band plays)

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:17.835
(marching music plays through
headphones)

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:55.439
- Hey Kevin.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.606
Good to see you.

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:58.275
- Thanks for coming in.

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:00.277
I just have a couple
papers for you to sign.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:02.012
- No problem.

01:03:02.079 --> 01:03:03.613
So, where's Patrick?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.515
- He's on his way.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:08.018
Listen, I know that
graduation's coming up fast,

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:10.720
but I want to make sure
I told you.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.257
You truly have an amazing son.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:14.859
- Well thank you.

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:17.761
I know that when I was his
age all I did was goof off.

01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:19.496
- Woo, yeah!

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:21.031
- Watch out!

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:23.333
- Come on, is that all you got?

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.543
- Patrick?

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.379
- Didn't see that one coming.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:36.546
Dad?

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:38.382
I'm fine, Dad.

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:39.783
- I'm sorry.

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:42.920
- Dad, please,
we were just having fun.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.859
- You two should know better.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.260
- The nurse's station's right
down here.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.429
Let's just get him checked
out to be sure.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.463
- I'm sorry!

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.433
- [Patrick] Dad, I'm fine.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.268
(bell rings)

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.739
- Last class.

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.641
- I know, it's crazy.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.811
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with myself.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:09.813
- You'll be fine.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.882
- Thanks, Mr. Howard.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.951
- Please, call me Kevin.

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:16.620
It's our last class!

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.555
- It's sad.

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:23.593
- Patrick, don't you dare
let this ending get you down.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.064
You've got bigger things to do.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.035
- Can I drive it?

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:32.736
- No, but you two can start it.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.238
- I'm too young to die.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.773
- Hey, not a bad driver, okay?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.542
- Yeah.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:42.913
- Mr. Hughes.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.880
- Oh, hey Bryce.

01:04:43.948 --> 01:04:45.315
- What's up, man?

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.985
- Well congratulations, Bryce.

01:04:48.052 --> 01:04:49.519
- Thank you.

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:51.721
I'm gonna miss you, bro.

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:54.158
- Yeah, 'cause Lexington's
so far away.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.825
- Hey, Patrick tell ya?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.662
He's gonna be a real live
member of the U of L pep band.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.629
- Really?

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.398
- It's true.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:03.067
- No, I'm sorry.

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:04.268
We have a policy.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.103
In order to be in the pep band

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:07.837
you have to first be in the
marching band.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.775
- And I'm aware of that, but
you can't make an exception?

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.978
I mean, come on!

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:15.779
- No, no, I'm sorry.

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.681
He'd have to march.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:24.054
Patrick, I saw you at
the Crusade years ago.

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:26.590
You played the
Crusade Cannonball?

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.758
You were fantastic.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.195
- Well thank you very much.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.999
- And that's very sweet,
but my son is

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:36.933
going to have all the
same opportunities

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:38.568
as every other kid
in this school.

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:40.070
You can't exclude him.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:42.839
- I didn't say anything
about excluding him.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:45.375
I said he has to be a
member of the marching band

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.278
in order to be considered
for the pep band.

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:51.015
- Patrick was already on
the Atherton marching band.

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.683
And I don't want to see him
sitting on the sidelines again.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.285
- Well neither do I.

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:57.954
I want to see him march
with everybody else.

01:05:58.022 --> 01:05:58.955
(sighs)

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.227
Look, we can find somebody
to push him through

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:07.564
the formations and Patrick, well

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.566
everybody knows
Patrick can play.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.168
- I'm sorry, but no.

01:06:11.235 --> 01:06:12.669
Absolutely not.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:14.471
I cannot take the risk
that somebody

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:18.008
might dump him on the field
in front of 40,000 people.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.743
I'm sorry!

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:25.649
- Well, then my hands are tied.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:30.320
He can't march, he can't play.

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.477
- Look Patrick...

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.288
- I hate being different!

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.290
- You're not different.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.825
- Okay, what else can I do,
bowling?

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:11.261
- You just need to focus on
the things that you can do.

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:12.562
- I know, I am trying!

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:14.798
Why can't we find someone
else to push me?

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:15.699
- We've been over this.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:16.600
- I want to march!

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.702
- You can't...

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:19.769
You can't march.

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:22.639
- You said I wasn't different.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:30.380
- How'd it go?

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.482
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.689
(marching music plays through
headphones)

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:33.377
- Do you have those sales
reports I asked for?

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:34.544
- Yeah, I emailed it.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.045
Do you want me to resend it?

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.680
- No, I'll check.

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:39.883
How's my presentation for
the board coming along?

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.286
- I'm working on it now.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:43.752
- I need it right away.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.589
- Yes sir.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.834
(phone rings)

01:08:57.901 --> 01:08:59.203
- Hello?

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:01.537
Oh yes, just a second.

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:10.145
It's for you, Patrick.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:16.953
- Hello, this is Patrick.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.955
- Patrick, it's Dr. Byrne.

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:19.622
How are you?

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:20.657
- Oh, hi.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:21.957
- Just wanted you to know we

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:24.961
found someone to push you
for the band.

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.662
That is, if you still want to.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.799
- Of course, that's
what I've always wanted.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:31.600
But my dad,
is he okay with this?

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.036
- He knows.

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:36.139
You just make sure you're at
the practice field tomorrow.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:37.541
5:30.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:40.042
- Wow, okay, thank you so much.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.845
- No problem, Patrick.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.078
See you tomorrow.

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:45.180
- Sounds good.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:48.518
I'm gonna march!

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.728
- All right, well you have fun.

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.196
- Bye Mom, I will.

01:10:00.264 --> 01:10:01.465
- He'll be fine.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.468
I'm very glad to have you
here, Patrick.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:08.338
- Me too, I sure didn't
get any sleep last night.

01:10:10.173 --> 01:10:11.875
So who's gonna be pushing me?

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:17.347
- Well, he's not here
yet, but he will be soon.

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:23.587
- 5:29, I'm not late.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.589
- Dad, what are you doing here?

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:29.326
- Well, I thought maybe
I'd push ya.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:31.828
- Okay band,
let's rock and roll.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.697
Let's get at it.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.166
All right, ready?

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:41.204
One, two, one, two ready and.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:43.740
(band plays)

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.683
Okay stop, stop.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.085
Matt, listen, if you're
gonna head up this line

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:58.288
then you gotta lead him
in the right direction.

01:10:58.355 --> 01:11:00.089
Arc back to the 20 yard line.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:02.726
(drumming)

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:07.030
- Morning Charles.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.231
Did you get the presentation?

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:09.032
- I did.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.467
- And?

01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:13.637
- And, we'll talk about it.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.241
- Okay.

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.710
(drumming)

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.475
(saw buzzes)

01:12:03.453 --> 01:12:08.558
- One, two, one, two ready and.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:20.003
- Jesse, slow down bud.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:24.508
- How are you?

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:28.412
Oh, that bad, huh?

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.882
Oh oh oh, shoes, shoes.

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:33.517
How was your day?

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:34.551
- I'm hungry.

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:35.985
- Okay, well we'll eat soon.

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:37.754
- I'm hungry now.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.957
- He's a machine.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.897
This is killing me.

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:51.635
- Is it worth it?

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:55.539
- It is, but there's just so
much work.

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:59.543
I cannot do both.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.457
(phones ringing)

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:38.782
- Patrick.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:39.382
- Sir.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.283
- How are you?

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:41.951
- Well, sir.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.988
- Have a seat.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:14:00.837
You've been with this
agency for a long time.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.005
- 19 years.

01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:04.841
- That's a long time to be
with anybody.

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:07.944
- There's no question you've
been an outstanding employee.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.246
But these past few weeks, we've

01:14:10.313 --> 01:14:12.782
had some tough decisions
to make.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:18.622
- I'm sorry,
what are you saying exactly?

01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:25.461
- We want to give you a
promotion Patrick.

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:28.197
I've been here an even
longer time

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:32.168
and quite frankly,
I'm ready to retire.

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:35.939
I want you to replace me.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:37.674
- Sir.

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:40.510
I don't know what to say.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:42.311
- Uh, yes?

01:14:42.378 --> 01:14:44.147
(laughing)

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:46.916
- We need you around here.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.552
You've really stepped it
up and we want

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:51.420
you to know that that
hasn't gone unnoticed.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.656
It's a win-win.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:55.158
Better benefits, better salary.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.527
- There will be quite a
bit more travel.

01:14:57.594 --> 01:15:00.764
You know, New York,
Vegas, Phoenix.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:04.200
- Plenty of time to get
away from the fam.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.970
Enjoy life a little.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.806
- They'll have a
better life, too.

01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:12.441
- How often would I
need to be traveling?

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.644
- Keep your schedule open.

01:15:16.613 --> 01:15:17.981
- Right.

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:22.351
Right, well, thank you.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:23.452
Thank you guys so much.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:24.721
I cannot begin to tell you how

01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:27.190
much I appreciate
the opportunity.

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.692
I'm very excited.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:30.159
- Good job.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.228
- Sir, thank you.

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:38.602
Patricia, honey?

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:39.903
- [TV Announcer]
Have become an unlikely

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:42.538
father and son marching
band team.

01:15:42.606 --> 01:15:44.841
- You guys,
Daddy's got some big news.

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:45.942
- Come here, come here,
come here.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:46.976
Sit, watch.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.712
- We interviewed Dr. Greg Byrne,

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:51.848
director of the U of L
marching band.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:53.382
- The Hughes are a
great addition

01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:56.285
as a two member team to
our marching band

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:59.656
and it really shows the
potential everyone has

01:15:59.723 --> 01:16:01.390
regardless of their
circumstances.

01:16:01.457 --> 01:16:02.826
- [TV Announcer] The
sacrifice and love shown in

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.493
this father son relationship is

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.229
something we all can learn from.

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:07.997
- 20 years, Mike.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.333
Almost 20 years.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:13.637
Coffee runs and reports and
late nights and weekends

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:18.842
and bad breaks and then
I finally catch a break.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.010
- You should be happy.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.276
(knocking)

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.380
- Hey.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.785
What are you listening to?

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:38.688
- Just music, what's up?

01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:41.290
- Look.

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:44.627
We need to talk.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.295
The last couple of weeks,

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.597
getting to see you in the
band, everything, it has--

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:49.532
- Save your breath, Dad.

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:51.434
I know we're quitting.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:54.637
- You do?

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:57.406
- I can hear everything,
remember?

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:01.277
- Right.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:04.447
Listen.

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:09.052
I'm sorry, Patrick.

01:18:10.586 --> 01:18:12.321
Goodnight, buddy.

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:21.865
Why do you want to be a
part of the band so bad?

01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:26.035
- Isn't that what we all want?

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.273
- What?

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:33.376
- To play a part of a
bigger picture, to matter.

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.178
- Patrick, of course you matter.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:37.446
- I'm talking about the
band, Dad.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:40.516
This is something I'm good
at and I know

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:44.954
you're just trying to provide
for us, I understand that.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:47.023
But we're part of this,
and who knows

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:50.927
where it's gonna end up,
but don't you wanna see?

01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:53.797
(emotional music)

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.808
(sighs)

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.647
(knocking)

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:13.282
- Come in!

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:14.884
- Good morning, sir.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:17.353
- Hey, Patrick.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.521
Good to see you.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.989
Hey, sit down.

01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:22.658
- Uh, thank you, sir, this
will only take a minute.

01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:26.629
- Hey, saw you on TV last night.

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:27.696
That was a hoot.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.533
- Yes sir, I suppose it was.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:31.634
Actually, that's partly what I

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.236
wanted to speak with you about.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:34.337
- How so?

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:38.707
- Well, first of all I
can't begin

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:42.846
to express how grateful I am
to you, the board, everyone.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:46.983
I spent the night praying
about it, sir,

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:50.820
and I just can't accept
the promotion, Charles.

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:52.288
- Hold on.

01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:55.224
Do you realize what
you're saying?

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:58.995
- Yes sir, I do, and that's
exactly why I'm leaving.

01:19:59.062 --> 01:20:01.097
- You have a son who
can't see anything,

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:03.432
has all sorts of medical
problems, a family that you're

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:07.036
supposed to be leading
and you're gonna quit?

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:09.305
Get your priorities straight,
Patrick!

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:13.409
- My priorities, sir,
are just fine.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.850
(emotional music swells)

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.362
- What made you do it?

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:10.066
- I'm tired of sitting on
the sidelines.

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:16.539
- I love you.

01:21:17.941 --> 01:21:19.642
- I love you, too.

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:33.389
- Ready and one, two,
one two ready and.

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:14.363
Okay stop, reset.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.099
Come on.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.635
(emotional music)

01:24:22.925 --> 01:24:24.660
- Patrick?

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.029
- I'm sorry Dad, I
didn't mean to wake you.

01:24:27.096 --> 01:24:29.098
- Hey, you made it.

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:31.267
- Yeah, I did.

01:24:31.334 --> 01:24:33.936
- Let me guess, you're thirsty?

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.738
- Parched.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:44.079
- Listen, wake me up next time,
okay?

01:24:44.147 --> 01:24:46.282
- I just know you need
your sleep.

01:24:46.349 --> 01:24:48.851
- I already told you.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.255
Four hours and I'm good.

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:54.423
Here, it's in front of you.

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:59.728
Now, let's go get you ready.

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:01.464
- Okay.

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:10.173
- So you nervous?

01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:12.175
- Maybe a little, you?

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:13.742
- Eh.

01:25:15.178 --> 01:25:16.312
Yeah.

01:25:16.379 --> 01:25:18.080
- Don't be, you'll do great.

01:25:18.147 --> 01:25:19.382
It's just like we practiced.

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:22.551
- Ah, that's what I'm
worried about.

01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:27.923
Gosh, you should
see it, Patrick.

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:34.463
42,000 seats and tomorrow
they'll all be watching.

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.165
- It's pretty exciting.

01:25:36.232 --> 01:25:38.367
- Yeah it is.

01:25:39.935 --> 01:25:43.572
You know, I remember the very
first game in this stadium.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:46.842
It was against Kentucky
then, too.

01:25:46.909 --> 01:25:52.815
The second quarter, Redmond,
he gets down on the center.

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:54.950
He takes the snap, he
drops back, fakes the

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:59.222
handoff, fires to Otis,
22 yards, touchdown!

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:01.690
And everybody went nuts!

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:05.928
It was incredible.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.765
You don't remember that game,
do you?

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:11.166
- Not really.

01:26:11.234 --> 01:26:13.569
Honestly, they all kind of
blend together.

01:26:13.636 --> 01:26:15.003
Did we win?

01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:17.072
- Uh, no, we lost.

01:26:17.139 --> 01:26:19.642
68-34, but we did win
every other

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:22.478
game in this stadium
that season.

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.516
- Hey Dad?

01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:28.951
- Yeah.

01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:33.188
- Thank you.

01:26:35.224 --> 01:26:38.093
You've given up everything
for me.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.862
Everything.

01:26:40.963 --> 01:26:42.765
And you're my hero.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:52.441
- Patrick, what you go through

01:26:52.508 --> 01:26:57.513
every single day, you're mine.

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.318
I love you.

01:27:02.385 --> 01:27:04.387
- I love you, Dad.

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:12.395
(chatter)

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:28.677
How do I look?

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.347
- You do look good in red.

01:27:31.414 --> 01:27:34.317
- Because I totally know
what that means.

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:37.553
- You look great, buddy.

01:27:40.389 --> 01:27:41.890
- Big day!

01:27:43.359 --> 01:27:44.293
- You guys ready?

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.794
- Yup.

01:27:47.363 --> 01:27:49.097
- I got faith in ya.

01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:50.766
Just like we practiced.

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:51.734
- Right.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.069
- You look good in red.

01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:56.672
(exciting music)

01:28:06.549 --> 01:28:08.984
- You ready to take
this field with me, Dad?

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:16.359
- Yeah.

01:28:16.425 --> 01:28:17.460
Yeah.

01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:19.428
Let's do it.

01:28:20.195 --> 01:28:21.229
- Ready?

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:22.097
- You ready?

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:22.965
- Ready.

01:28:24.266 --> 01:28:27.736
- Keep your head up,
high as it'll go!

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:28.871
Woo!

01:28:28.937 --> 01:28:30.473
(cheering)

01:28:30.539 --> 01:28:32.808
(triumphant music)

01:28:55.398 --> 01:28:57.332
- We love you!

01:29:29.498 --> 01:29:31.500
Some said we'd never make it

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:33.636
And we should throw in the towel

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:38.140
They had their reservations
that couldn't hold us down

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.242
Dug in a little deeper

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:42.244
Set our sights on so much more

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:47.583
Gonna be that dark horse
sleeper everyone is cheering for

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:51.920
Got a million reasons why

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.623
Just look up at the sky

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:59.294
Gonna keep on dreaming,
keep believing

01:29:59.361 --> 01:30:03.466
With all that's in our heart
'cause that's just who we are

01:30:03.532 --> 01:30:08.103
Gonna see us shining burning
bright and

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:12.107
Lighting up the dark,

Straight for the moon
we're shooting

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.030
Burning hot like a flame

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:36.865
Got no time for excuses

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:39.334
Gotta keep our head in the game

01:30:39.401 --> 01:30:41.470
Mountains we'll ascend them

01:30:41.537 --> 01:30:43.606
And then we'll take in the views

01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:45.674
Still building up momentum

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:48.777
Still seeing wishes come true

01:30:50.345 --> 01:30:52.981
Gotta million reasons why

01:30:54.216 --> 01:30:55.718

So much to see if we just
open our eyes

01:31:18.707 --> 01:31:22.778
So much to dream if
we just give it a try

01:31:22.845 --> 01:31:27.650
No more and we might
be surprised

01:31:27.716 --> 01:31:33.155
Let your light shine,
