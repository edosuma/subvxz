00:42.622 --> 00:45.022
<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

00:45.191 --> 00:47.887
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

00:48.061 --> 00:50.325
<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

00:50.497 --> 00:52.431
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

00:55.769 --> 00:57.396
<i>But what of the man?</i>

00:58.938 --> 01:01.099
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes...</i>

01:01.274 --> 01:06.007
<i>... and I know in 1605, he attempted</i>
<i>to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

01:06.179 --> 01:08.409
<i>But who was he really?</i>

01:08.581 --> 01:10.014
<i>What was he like?</i>

01:16.823 --> 01:20.315
<i>We are told to remember the idea</i>
<i>and not the man.</i>

01:20.493 --> 01:22.051
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

01:23.196 --> 01:27.223
<i>He can be caught,</i>
<i>he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

01:27.400 --> 01:29.459
<i>But 400 years later...</i>

01:29.636 --> 01:32.366
<i>... an idea can still change the world.</i>

01:33.840 --> 01:37.367
<i>I have witnessed firsthand</i>
<i>the power of ideas.</i>

01:37.911 --> 01:39.970
<i>I've seen people kill</i>
<i>in the name of them...</i>

01:41.881 --> 01:43.508
<i>... and die defending them.</i>

01:45.485 --> 01:47.749
<i>But you cannot kiss an idea...</i>

01:48.188 --> 01:51.157
<i>... cannot touch it or hold it.</i>

01:52.225 --> 01:55.922
<i>Ideas do not bleed.</i>
<i>They do not feel pain.</i>

01:56.296 --> 01:58.196
<i>They do not love.</i>

02:00.900 --> 02:03.562
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

02:03.736 --> 02:05.704
<i>It is a man.</i>

02:05.872 --> 02:09.399
<i>A man that made me remember</i>
<i>the 5th of November.</i>

02:09.576 --> 02:11.669
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

02:24.657 --> 02:30.095
<i>So I read that the former United States</i>
<i>is so desperate for medical supplies...</i>

02:30.263 --> 02:35.291
<i>... that they have allegedly sent several</i>
<i>containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

02:35.468 --> 02:38.904
<i>A gesture, they said, of goodwill.</i>

02:39.272 --> 02:40.933
<i>You wanna know what I think?</i>

02:41.941 --> 02:44.739
<i>Well, you're listening to my show,</i>
<i>so I will assume you do.</i>

02:44.911 --> 02:48.278
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know</i>
<i>what we really think of them.</i>

02:48.448 --> 02:52.714
<i>I think it's payback time for a little tea party</i>
<i>they threw for us a few hundred years ago.</i>

02:52.886 --> 02:56.083
<i>I say we go down to those docks tonight</i>
<i>and dump that crap...</i>

02:56.256 --> 02:59.555
<i>... where everything from</i>
<i>the Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica belongs!</i>

02:59.726 --> 03:02.126
<i>Who's with me? Who's bloody with me?!</i>

03:03.429 --> 03:04.896
<i>Did you like that?</i>

03:05.064 --> 03:09.228
<i>U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-erica.</i>
<i>I mean, what else can you say?</i>

03:09.402 --> 03:12.963
<i>Here was a country that had everything,</i>
<i>absolutely everything...</i>

03:13.139 --> 03:15.471
<i>... and now, 20 years later, is what?</i>

03:15.642 --> 03:19.305
<i>The world's biggest leper colony. Why?</i>

03:20.246 --> 03:21.577
<i>Godlessness.</i>

03:21.748 --> 03:23.340
<i>Let me say that again.</i>

03:23.516 --> 03:24.813
<i>Godlessness.</i>

03:25.118 --> 03:28.519
<i>It wasn't the war they started.</i>
<i>It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

03:28.955 --> 03:30.946
<i>It was Judgment.</i>

03:31.124 --> 03:35.254
<i>No one escapes their past.</i>
<i>No one escapes Judgment.</i>

03:36.796 --> 03:38.661
<i>You think he's not up there?</i>

03:38.831 --> 03:41.322
<i>You think he's not watching over</i>
<i>this country?</i>

03:41.501 --> 03:45.699
<i>How else can you explain it?</i>
<i>He tested us, but we came through.</i>

03:45.872 --> 03:47.305
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>

03:47.640 --> 03:51.542
<i>Islington. Enfield.</i>
<i>I was there. I saw it all.</i>

03:51.711 --> 03:54.111
<i>Immigrants, Muslims...</i>

03:54.447 --> 03:57.007
<i>... homosexuals, terrorists.</i>

03:57.183 --> 04:01.119
<i>Disease-ridden degenerates.</i>
<i>They had to go.</i>

04:01.287 --> 04:04.450
<i>Strength through unity.</i>
<i>Unity through faith.</i>

04:04.624 --> 04:08.583
<i>I am a God-fearing Englishman,</i>
<i>and I'm goddamn proud of it!</i>

04:08.761 --> 04:11.127
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

04:12.899 --> 04:14.526
Oh, shit.

04:16.836 --> 04:20.430
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

04:20.607 --> 04:23.906
<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

04:24.077 --> 04:26.602
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

04:26.779 --> 04:30.044
<i>A yellow-coded curfew is now in effect.</i>

04:30.216 --> 04:33.674
<i>Any unauthorized personnel</i>
<i>will be subject to arrest.</i>

04:33.853 --> 04:35.286
<i>This is for your protection.</i>

04:37.590 --> 04:39.387
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

04:39.559 --> 04:41.220
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

04:41.394 --> 04:44.090
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

04:44.263 --> 04:47.858
- Sick uncle? What you think on that, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

04:48.034 --> 04:50.935
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

04:51.104 --> 04:54.471
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

04:54.641 --> 04:56.768
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

04:56.943 --> 04:59.776
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

04:59.946 --> 05:03.643
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

05:03.816 --> 05:06.580
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

05:06.753 --> 05:08.345
You know what that means,
don't you?

05:08.521 --> 05:11.251
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

05:11.658 --> 05:13.285
And you get to swallow it.

05:13.459 --> 05:15.586
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

05:15.762 --> 05:17.491
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

05:17.664 --> 05:19.655
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

05:19.832 --> 05:23.359
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

05:23.870 --> 05:25.929
...then you'll certainly be the sorest.

05:29.676 --> 05:31.644
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

05:31.811 --> 05:34.336
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

05:34.514 --> 05:37.745
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.509
Help me! Someone help!

05:39.686 --> 05:43.019
The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him.

05:44.323 --> 05:46.223
- What the hell?!
- Bugger off!

05:46.392 --> 05:48.451
Disdaining fortune,
with his brandish'd steel...

05:48.628 --> 05:50.493
...which smoked with bloody execution.

05:50.663 --> 05:52.153
We're Fingermen, pal.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.058
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

06:29.235 --> 06:31.396
We are oft to blame in this...
'Tis too much proved.

06:31.571 --> 06:35.405
- That with devotion's visage and pious action
we do sugar o'er the devil himself.

06:35.575 --> 06:38.237
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

06:44.183 --> 06:45.912
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

06:46.085 --> 06:47.746
- Who are you?
- Who?

06:47.920 --> 06:50.354
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

06:50.523 --> 06:52.354
...and what I am is a man in a mask.

06:52.525 --> 06:54.584
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

06:54.761 --> 06:56.888
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

06:57.063 --> 07:01.159
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

07:02.769 --> 07:05.966
- Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

07:06.139 --> 07:09.438
...permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

07:09.609 --> 07:12.737
...to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.504
VoilÃ !

07:15.681 --> 07:17.672
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

07:17.850 --> 07:22.014
...cast vicariously as both victim and villain
by the vicissitudes of fate.

07:22.188 --> 07:24.884
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

07:25.057 --> 07:28.549
...is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

07:28.728 --> 07:33.097
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

07:33.266 --> 07:36.997
...and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

07:37.170 --> 07:40.970
...and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

07:47.113 --> 07:50.241
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

07:50.416 --> 07:54.113
...held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

07:54.287 --> 07:57.586
...shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

08:00.860 --> 08:04.091
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

08:04.263 --> 08:07.198
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

08:07.366 --> 08:09.061
...and you may call me V.

08:11.337 --> 08:13.328
Are you, like, a crazy person?

08:13.506 --> 08:15.531
I am quite sure they will say so.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.676
But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

08:19.512 --> 08:21.707
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

08:21.881 --> 08:24.247
E-vey. Of course you are.

08:24.784 --> 08:27.116
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

08:27.286 --> 08:30.517
...do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

08:30.690 --> 08:32.520
Are you hurt?

08:32.692 --> 08:34.352
No, I'm fine.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.221
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

08:38.397 --> 08:42.094
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

08:42.268 --> 08:44.293
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

08:44.470 --> 08:46.870
...and on my way to give
a very special performance.

08:47.039 --> 08:48.597
What kind of musician?

08:48.774 --> 08:50.639
Percussion instruments
are my speciality.

08:50.810 --> 08:54.143
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

08:54.313 --> 08:56.338
...and would be honored
if you could join me.

08:56.515 --> 08:58.642
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

08:58.818 --> 09:01.378
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

09:01.554 --> 09:04.318
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

09:06.692 --> 09:07.784
All right.

09:09.795 --> 09:11.160
It's beautiful up here.

09:11.664 --> 09:15.725
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

09:15.902 --> 09:17.392
I don't see any instruments.

09:17.570 --> 09:20.471
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

09:21.207 --> 09:25.871
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

09:26.045 --> 09:29.344
...in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

09:29.515 --> 09:33.542
...and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.945
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

09:38.291 --> 09:41.488
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

09:47.366 --> 09:50.927
<i>Remember, remember</i>
<i>The 5th of November</i>

09:51.103 --> 09:54.163
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

09:54.340 --> 09:57.309
<i>I know of no reason</i>
<i>Why the gunpowder treason</i>

09:57.476 --> 10:00.001
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

10:03.883 --> 10:06.716
First, the overture.

10:07.687 --> 10:09.780
Yes.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.217
Yes, the strings.

10:14.126 --> 10:15.855
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

10:17.063 --> 10:19.122
Now the brass.

10:19.298 --> 10:21.027
I can hear it!

10:26.973 --> 10:30.101
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

10:34.780 --> 10:36.941
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

10:37.116 --> 10:39.050
Here comes the crescendo!

10:46.792 --> 10:49.124
How beautiful, is it not?

11:00.706 --> 11:04.972
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.</i>
<i>You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

11:06.345 --> 11:08.074
The Bailey area is quarantined.

11:08.247 --> 11:10.477
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

11:10.649 --> 11:11.877
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

11:12.051 --> 11:16.078
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

11:16.255 --> 11:19.019
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture</i>.

11:19.191 --> 11:21.625
<i>Add it to the blacklist.</i>
<i>I never want to hear that again.</i>

11:21.794 --> 11:23.022
Yes, sir.

11:23.195 --> 11:26.926
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

11:27.099 --> 11:30.660
...indicating a high percentage of
conversation concerned with the explosion.

11:30.836 --> 11:32.804
<i>Mr. Dascomb,</i>
<i>what are we doing about that?</i>

11:32.972 --> 11:35.372
We're calling it an emergency demolition.

11:35.541 --> 11:38.567
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

11:38.744 --> 11:42.942
Several experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

11:43.115 --> 11:46.084
<i>I want Prothero to speak on</i>
<i>the dangers of these old buildings...</i>

11:46.252 --> 11:49.710
<i>... and how we must avoid clinging</i>
<i>to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

11:49.889 --> 11:53.552
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey</i>
<i>will become the symbol of our time...</i>

11:53.726 --> 11:56.854
<i>... and the future</i>
<i>that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

11:57.029 --> 11:58.257
<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

11:58.431 --> 12:01.628
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

12:01.801 --> 12:05.168
...though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

12:05.337 --> 12:10.502
We also managed to get a picture of the girl
that Creedy's men were detaining.

12:10.676 --> 12:12.974
<i>- Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

12:13.145 --> 12:15.670
- But we're working on several leads.
<i>- Anything else?</i>

12:15.881 --> 12:17.644
We located the fireworks launch...

12:17.817 --> 12:20.684
...and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

12:20.853 --> 12:26.120
Unfortunately it appears that
despite the heavy level of sophistication...

12:26.292 --> 12:29.989
...these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

12:30.162 --> 12:32.653
...making them very difficult to trace.

12:33.899 --> 12:36.663
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

12:36.869 --> 12:40.202
<i>Spare us your professional annotations,</i>
<i>Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

12:40.372 --> 12:42.101
Apologies, chancellor.

12:42.274 --> 12:43.901
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

12:44.076 --> 12:46.704
<i>Moments such as these</i>
<i>are matters of faith.</i>

12:46.879 --> 12:50.076
<i>To fail is to invite doubt</i>
<i>into everything we believe...</i>

12:50.249 --> 12:51.944
<i>... everything we have fought for.</i>

12:52.118 --> 12:57.055
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back</i>
<i>into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

12:57.223 --> 12:59.748
<i>Gentlemen, I want this terrorist found...</i>

12:59.925 --> 13:04.259
<i>... and I want him to understand</i>
<i>what terror really means.</i>

13:04.463 --> 13:05.896
<i>England prevails.</i>

13:06.365 --> 13:08.629
England prevails.

13:14.874 --> 13:18.139
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

13:18.310 --> 13:20.210
This is the BTN.

13:20.379 --> 13:23.109
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

13:23.883 --> 13:25.783
That's the government's job.

13:27.286 --> 13:29.049
On the lighter side of things...

13:29.221 --> 13:32.713
...seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey...

13:32.892 --> 13:35.952
...wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

13:37.429 --> 13:40.023
<i>Although the demolition had been</i>
<i>planned for some time...</i>

13:40.199 --> 13:43.259
<i>... the music and the fireworks were,</i>
<i>according to the crew chief...</i>

13:43.435 --> 13:46.302
<i>..."definitely not on the schedule."</i>
<i>- We'll be right back.</i>

13:46.472 --> 13:50.306
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

13:50.476 --> 13:51.943
I saw it, the whole thing.

13:52.411 --> 13:54.811
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

13:54.980 --> 13:58.279
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

13:59.051 --> 14:00.951
Evey, there you are.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.281
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

14:03.455 --> 14:05.821
I need two espressos and three coffees.

14:05.991 --> 14:07.982
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

14:10.229 --> 14:11.457
I don't get it.

14:11.630 --> 14:15.691
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

14:15.868 --> 14:19.827
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

14:20.272 --> 14:22.263
Maybe he's just getting started.

14:24.076 --> 14:25.509
Yeah?

14:26.011 --> 14:28.002
Okay. A lead on the girl.

14:28.214 --> 14:31.115
Look, don't get me wrong, I love it.
A cow getting crucified.

14:31.517 --> 14:34.452
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

14:34.620 --> 14:37.316
You've got to rewrite it, okay?
Gotta go.

14:38.357 --> 14:41.053
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

14:41.227 --> 14:42.990
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

14:43.162 --> 14:45.722
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

14:45.898 --> 14:47.525
Gordon...

14:47.700 --> 14:50.635
...I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

14:50.803 --> 14:52.395
...and I got scared and went home.

14:52.571 --> 14:57.065
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.888
Gotcha.

15:19.198 --> 15:21.223
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.265
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

15:23.435 --> 15:25.699
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

15:27.106 --> 15:29.199
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

15:29.375 --> 15:31.309
Laser Lass is banging.

15:45.157 --> 15:46.181
What's all that?

15:46.358 --> 15:49.452
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

15:49.628 --> 15:51.289
Must be Prothero.

15:51.463 --> 15:55.797
I wish someone had the balls to tell
that brat this station ain't his playground.

15:57.870 --> 15:59.428
What the hell is this?

16:01.073 --> 16:05.271
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

16:05.844 --> 16:09.746
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

16:09.915 --> 16:13.078
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

16:13.252 --> 16:15.584
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

16:15.754 --> 16:16.914
...for five years.
- Shit.

16:17.089 --> 16:19.455
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

16:19.625 --> 16:20.956
You sure about that, sir?

16:21.126 --> 16:25.290
I want a chance to talk to her before she
disappears into one of Creedy's black bags.

16:37.443 --> 16:38.671
Who's that?

16:38.844 --> 16:42.678
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

16:48.787 --> 16:50.015
Fucking hell.

16:52.858 --> 16:54.553
Come on, let's move!

17:14.246 --> 17:17.113
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

17:17.281 --> 17:18.943
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

17:20.953 --> 17:24.912
<i>Will all personnel please</i>
<i>evacuate the building.</i>

17:25.223 --> 17:26.851
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

17:27.526 --> 17:30.051
<i>Will all personnel evacuate the building.</i>

17:36.135 --> 17:37.329
What the hell's going on?

17:37.503 --> 17:39.528
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

17:45.277 --> 17:46.710
Dominic!

17:47.679 --> 17:49.146
Police! Out of the way!

17:51.316 --> 17:52.374
Get out the way!

18:00.058 --> 18:01.389
Damn it!

18:04.863 --> 18:07.331
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>

18:07.499 --> 18:10.161
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>England prevails.</i>

18:13.071 --> 18:14.902
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

18:16.275 --> 18:18.106
<i>Help, Storm, help!</i>

18:29.521 --> 18:30.715
Don't touch it.

18:30.889 --> 18:33.016
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

18:49.074 --> 18:50.735
<i>Good evening, London.</i>

18:51.210 --> 18:54.202
<i>- Allow me first to apologize...</i>
- That's the emergency channel!

18:54.413 --> 18:58.509
<i>I do, like many of you, appreciate</i>
<i>the comforts of the everyday routine...</i>

18:58.684 --> 19:02.677
<i>... the security of the familiar,</i>
<i>the tranquility of repetition.</i>

19:02.855 --> 19:03.947
Bloody hell.

19:04.122 --> 19:07.614
<i>I enjoy them as much as any bloke.</i>
<i>But in the spirit of commemoration...</i>

19:07.793 --> 19:08.851
Who's that, Mum?

19:09.027 --> 19:10.927
<i>- Whereby important events of the past...</i>

19:11.096 --> 19:15.123
<i>... usually associated with someone's death</i>
<i>or the end of some awful, bloody struggle...</i>

19:15.300 --> 19:17.894
<i>... are celebrated with a nice holiday...</i>

19:18.103 --> 19:20.594
<i>... I thought we could mark</i>
<i>this November the 5th...</i>

19:20.806 --> 19:23.070
<i>... a day that is, sadly,</i>
<i>no longer remembered...</i>

19:23.509 --> 19:27.843
<i>... by taking some time out of our daily lives</i>
<i>to sit down and have a little chat.</i>

19:28.013 --> 19:31.005
<i>There are, of course,</i>
<i>those who do not want us to speak.</i>

19:31.183 --> 19:32.445
Let me think, let me think.

19:32.618 --> 19:35.109
<i>Even now, orders are being shouted</i>
<i>into telephones...</i>

19:35.287 --> 19:37.482
<i>... and men with guns</i>
<i>will soon be on their way.</i>

19:37.656 --> 19:39.487
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

19:39.658 --> 19:44.027
<i>Why? Because while the truncheon</i>
<i>may be used in lieu of conversation...</i>

19:44.196 --> 19:46.994
<i>... words will always retain their power.</i>

19:47.165 --> 19:49.633
<i>Words offer the means to meaning...</i>

19:49.801 --> 19:52.998
<i>... and, for those who will listen,</i>
<i>the enunciation of truth.</i>

19:53.171 --> 19:54.570
<i>And the truth is...</i>

19:54.740 --> 19:58.141
<i>... there is something terribly wrong</i>
<i>with this country, isn't there?</i>

19:58.310 --> 20:01.711
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

20:01.880 --> 20:05.475
<i>Cruelty and injustice,</i>
<i>intolerance and oppression.</i>

20:05.651 --> 20:07.983
<i>And where once</i>
<i>you had the freedom to object...</i>

20:08.153 --> 20:09.950
<i>... to think and speak as you saw fit...</i>

20:10.122 --> 20:13.353
<i>... you now have censors and surveillance</i>
<i>coercing your conformity...</i>

20:13.525 --> 20:16.358
...<i>and soliciting submission</i>.
- Cameras. We need cameras.

20:16.562 --> 20:19.190
<i>How did this happen? Who's to blame?</i>

20:19.731 --> 20:22.632
<i>Certainly there are those</i>
<i>who are more responsible than others.</i>

20:22.801 --> 20:24.701
<i>And they will be held accountable.</i>

20:24.870 --> 20:27.839
<i>But again, truth be told,</i>
<i>if you're looking for the guilty...</i>

20:28.340 --> 20:30.740
<i>... you need only look into a mirror.</i>

20:31.376 --> 20:33.037
<i>I know why you did it.</i>

20:33.211 --> 20:34.906
<i>I know you were afraid.</i>

20:35.080 --> 20:38.607
<i>Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease.</i>

20:38.784 --> 20:41.480
<i>There were a myriad of problems</i>
<i>which conspired...</i>

20:41.653 --> 20:45.020
<i>... to corrupt your reason</i>
<i>and rob you of your common sense.</i>

20:45.190 --> 20:46.782
<i>Fear got the best of you.</i>

20:46.959 --> 20:51.191
<i>And in your panic, you turned to</i>
<i>the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler.</i>

20:51.363 --> 20:53.888
<i>He promised you order,</i>
<i>he promised you peace...</i>

20:54.099 --> 20:57.830
<i>... and all he demanded in return</i>
<i>was your silent, obedient consent.</i>

20:58.003 --> 21:01.769
- Inspector, they're almost through.
<i>- Last night, I sought to end that silence.</i>

21:01.940 --> 21:04.238
<i>Last night,</i>
<i>I destroyed the Old Bailey...</i>

21:04.443 --> 21:07.776
<i>... to remind this country</i>
<i>of what it has forgotten.</i>

21:08.580 --> 21:13.279
<i>More than 400 years ago, a great citizen</i>
<i>wished to imbed the 5th of November...</i>

21:13.452 --> 21:14.919
<i>... forever in our memory.</i>

21:15.087 --> 21:18.750
<i>His hope was to remind the world</i>
<i>that fairness, justice and freedom...</i>

21:18.924 --> 21:20.915
<i>... are more than words.</i>

21:21.093 --> 21:22.685
<i>They are perspectives.</i>

21:22.861 --> 21:24.726
<i>So if you've seen nothing...</i>

21:24.896 --> 21:28.662
<i>... if the crimes of this government</i>
<i>remain unknown to you...</i>

21:28.834 --> 21:33.100
<i>... then I would suggest that you allow</i>
<i>the 5th of November to pass unmarked.</i>

21:33.271 --> 21:36.399
<i>But if you see what I see...</i>

21:36.575 --> 21:41.137
<i>... if you feel as I feel,</i>
<i>and if you would seek as I seek...</i>

21:41.313 --> 21:44.214
<i>... then I ask you to stand beside me,</i>
<i>one year from tonight...</i>

21:44.383 --> 21:46.544
<i>... outside the gates of Parliament.</i>

21:46.752 --> 21:49.448
<i>And together, we shall give them</i>
<i>a 5th of November...</i>

21:49.655 --> 21:52.818
<i>... that shall never, ever be forgot.</i>

21:59.064 --> 22:01.123
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

22:01.299 --> 22:02.823
Cover the exits.

22:03.001 --> 22:05.765
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

22:09.174 --> 22:10.402
Left.

22:10.575 --> 22:11.974
You go right.

22:12.144 --> 22:13.771
Spread out.

22:21.019 --> 22:23.487
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

22:25.757 --> 22:27.349
Hold your fire!

22:33.965 --> 22:35.489
He put masks on all of us.

22:35.667 --> 22:36.929
Jesus.

22:37.102 --> 22:38.592
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

22:38.804 --> 22:40.328
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

22:40.505 --> 22:42.666
Freeze! Nobody move!

22:42.874 --> 22:45.104
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

22:50.549 --> 22:52.449
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

22:54.352 --> 22:56.149
There's a bomb in the control booth.

22:56.321 --> 22:57.948
Oh, no.

22:59.024 --> 23:02.289
- Jones, get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

23:02.461 --> 23:04.827
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

23:04.996 --> 23:06.554
Everyone else, let's go.

23:15.474 --> 23:16.498
Good God.

23:16.675 --> 23:19.075
Hurry up, you lot! Come on!
Everybody out!

23:28.120 --> 23:29.883
Dascomb.

23:30.055 --> 23:33.923
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

23:34.092 --> 23:36.151
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

23:36.328 --> 23:37.488
Wait, wait!

23:38.697 --> 23:41.165
Don't shoot me, please! It's him! It's him!

23:42.267 --> 23:44.827
On your knees! On your knees!

23:45.704 --> 23:47.399
Please! Please don't hurt me!

24:14.432 --> 24:16.093
Here we go.

24:21.907 --> 24:23.135
I did it.

24:23.508 --> 24:24.736
I did it.

24:29.581 --> 24:30.912
Freeze!

24:31.082 --> 24:33.880
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

24:35.620 --> 24:40.319
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

24:41.193 --> 24:44.560
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

24:44.729 --> 24:47.323
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

24:47.499 --> 24:48.796
I don't know about that.

25:03.281 --> 25:07.615
<i>We're interrupting your regularly scheduled</i>
<i>program to bring you this terrifying report...</i>

25:07.786 --> 25:11.415
<i>... of a terrorist takeover of Jordan Tower</i>
<i>which ended only moments ago.</i>

25:11.590 --> 25:14.821
<i>A psychotic terrorist,</i>
<i>identified only as the letter V...</i>

25:14.993 --> 25:18.952
<i>... attacked the control booth with</i>
<i>high-powered explosives and weapons...</i>

25:19.130 --> 25:23.260
<i>... that he used against unarmed civilians</i>
<i>in order to broadcast a message of hate.</i>

25:23.768 --> 25:28.034
<i>We've just received this footage</i>
<i>of a daring police raid.</i>

25:28.974 --> 25:33.843
<i>Stop! Stop, stay where you are,</i>
<i>or we'll shoot! Stay where you are!</i>

25:35.881 --> 25:38.349
<i>Now, this is only an initial report...</i>

25:38.850 --> 25:42.513
<i>... but at this time, it's believed</i>
<i>that during this heroic raid...</i>

25:42.687 --> 25:44.518
<i>... the terrorist was shot and killed.</i>

25:44.689 --> 25:45.917
Bollocks.

25:46.091 --> 25:49.549
<i>Again, from what we've been told</i>
<i>by authorities, the danger is now over.</i>

25:49.728 --> 25:51.355
<i>The terrorist is dead.</i>

25:55.367 --> 25:58.234
Right there. What's he thinking?

25:58.703 --> 26:00.864
Is he considering leaving her?

26:02.140 --> 26:04.472
After she just saved him?

26:05.610 --> 26:09.706
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

26:09.881 --> 26:11.940
Some part of him's human.

26:12.717 --> 26:16.050
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

27:43.008 --> 27:45.636
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

27:46.211 --> 27:48.736
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

27:48.913 --> 27:51.347
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

27:51.516 --> 27:54.974
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

27:55.153 --> 27:58.088
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

27:58.256 --> 28:01.851
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

28:02.027 --> 28:03.961
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

28:04.129 --> 28:05.994
Stealing implies ownership.

28:06.164 --> 28:09.327
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

28:09.501 --> 28:11.264
God, if they ever find this place...

28:11.436 --> 28:15.395
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

28:15.573 --> 28:17.837
You mean, after what you've done.

28:18.476 --> 28:20.671
God, what have I done?

28:20.845 --> 28:22.972
I Maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

28:23.148 --> 28:26.709
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

28:26.885 --> 28:28.819
I must have been out of my mind.

28:28.987 --> 28:32.218
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

28:32.724 --> 28:34.214
I think I should go.

28:34.392 --> 28:36.451
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

28:36.628 --> 28:40.564
They're looking for you. If they know
where you work, they know where you live.

28:40.732 --> 28:45.567
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

28:45.737 --> 28:48.865
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

28:49.040 --> 28:50.701
...but I couldn't see any other way.

28:50.875 --> 28:53.139
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

28:53.311 --> 28:57.509
If I had left you there, right now you'd be
in one of Creedy's interrogation cells.

28:57.682 --> 29:01.584
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

29:01.753 --> 29:03.721
...in the pursuit of finding me.

29:03.888 --> 29:06.288
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

29:06.458 --> 29:10.451
...so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

29:10.628 --> 29:12.220
Here, to my home.

29:12.797 --> 29:16.164
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

29:16.334 --> 29:18.768
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

29:18.937 --> 29:20.928
But I don't even know where this is.

29:21.106 --> 29:24.098
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

29:24.275 --> 29:28.302
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

29:28.480 --> 29:31.847
Only until I'm done.
After the 5th, I no longer think it'll matter.

29:32.016 --> 29:33.984
You mean a year from now?

29:34.152 --> 29:35.949
I have to stay here for a year?

29:36.121 --> 29:39.090
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

29:39.257 --> 29:40.918
You should've left me alone.

29:41.092 --> 29:43.458
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

29:46.297 --> 29:49.460
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

29:49.634 --> 29:51.659
They were interned at Belmarsh.

29:51.836 --> 29:53.531
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

29:53.705 --> 29:57.106
She died in a hunger strike.
He died when the military retook the shed.

29:57.509 --> 30:00.569
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

30:01.212 --> 30:03.908
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

30:04.349 --> 30:07.785
So we know her story. Now we need his.

30:29.574 --> 30:30.802
V?

30:33.578 --> 30:37.036
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

30:37.715 --> 30:41.879
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

30:42.954 --> 30:44.421
Your hands.

30:46.024 --> 30:47.389
Yes.

30:51.596 --> 30:53.359
There, that's better.

30:53.531 --> 30:55.590
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

30:55.767 --> 30:59.533
- No, please. It's just... Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

30:59.704 --> 31:01.137
Can I ask what happened?

31:02.140 --> 31:05.200
There was a fire. A long time ago.

31:05.376 --> 31:07.503
Ancient history, for some.

31:07.679 --> 31:09.544
Not really very good table conversation.

31:09.714 --> 31:12.376
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

31:12.817 --> 31:16.150
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

31:24.128 --> 31:26.858
- It's delicious.
- Good.

31:27.031 --> 31:30.125
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

31:30.301 --> 31:31.529
Where did you get it?

31:31.703 --> 31:34.900
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

31:35.873 --> 31:38.774
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

31:38.943 --> 31:40.171
You're insane.

31:40.345 --> 31:44.213
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

31:44.382 --> 31:46.816
<i>- Macbeth.</i>
- Very good.

31:46.985 --> 31:49.920
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

31:50.088 --> 31:52.352
...and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

31:52.523 --> 31:54.923
Be in plays, movies.

31:55.093 --> 31:58.654
When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night</i>. Mum was very proud.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.889
Where is your mother now?

32:01.065 --> 32:02.862
She's dead.

32:03.034 --> 32:04.262
I'm sorry.

32:06.604 --> 32:09.072
- Can I ask about what you said on the telly?
- Yes.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.832
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

32:11.009 --> 32:14.945
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

32:15.113 --> 32:17.411
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

32:17.582 --> 32:20.142
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

32:20.318 --> 32:22.218
...Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.954
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

32:25.123 --> 32:26.988
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

32:27.158 --> 32:29.558
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

32:30.828 --> 32:34.264
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

32:34.432 --> 32:36.195
Symbols are given power by people.

32:36.801 --> 32:40.134
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

32:40.305 --> 32:42.967
...blowing up a building
can change the world.

32:43.775 --> 32:45.902
I wish I believed that was possible.

32:46.344 --> 32:50.610
But every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

32:50.782 --> 32:54.775
<i>I'll tell you what I know.</i>
<i>I know this is not a man.</i>

32:54.952 --> 32:57.944
- What is he?
<i>- A man does not wear a mask.</i>

32:58.122 --> 33:01.387
- What is he?
<i>- A man does not threaten innocent civilians.</i>

33:01.793 --> 33:05.024
<i>He's what every gutless,</i>
<i>freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

33:05.196 --> 33:07.426
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

33:10.468 --> 33:11.935
There will be no negotiation.

33:12.103 --> 33:14.594
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

33:14.772 --> 33:18.264
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

33:18.443 --> 33:21.139
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

33:21.312 --> 33:24.770
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

33:24.949 --> 33:27.747
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

33:27.919 --> 33:31.184
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

33:33.725 --> 33:35.249
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

33:35.760 --> 33:37.387
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

33:37.562 --> 33:39.655
<i>I wish I'd had the chance</i>
<i>for a face-to-face.</i>

33:39.831 --> 33:41.628
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

33:47.004 --> 33:50.940
<i>This so-called V and his accomplice,</i>
<i>Evey Hammond...</i>

33:51.109 --> 33:54.408
<i>... neo-demagogues,</i>
<i>spouting their message of hate.</i>

33:54.579 --> 33:59.141
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice</i>
<i>delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

33:59.317 --> 34:03.014
<i>An ultimatum that was met</i>
<i>with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

34:03.187 --> 34:05.985
- No mercy!
<i>- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

34:06.157 --> 34:08.351
Good guys win, bad guys lose...

34:08.525 --> 34:11.927
...and, as always, England prevails!

34:13.965 --> 34:15.864
Holy Christ! Jesus!

34:17.235 --> 34:19.135
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

34:19.303 --> 34:21.862
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

34:22.039 --> 34:25.167
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

34:25.342 --> 34:27.572
...any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

34:27.745 --> 34:29.542
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

34:29.914 --> 34:34.476
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

34:34.652 --> 34:36.380
You wore a uniform in those days.

34:39.590 --> 34:41.148
You.

34:42.527 --> 34:46.018
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

34:54.438 --> 34:57.465
- Yeah?
<i>- Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

34:58.309 --> 35:00.743
- Dascomb.
<i>- I've already called the chancellor.</i>

35:00.912 --> 35:04.746
<i>- We have to get control of the situation.</i>
- What situation?

35:06.317 --> 35:10.310
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

35:10.488 --> 35:13.048
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

35:13.224 --> 35:15.249
...could be devastating to our credibility.

35:16.594 --> 35:18.221
Perhaps a stroke?

35:18.763 --> 35:21.163
No, no, it's too horrific.

35:21.332 --> 35:25.063
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

35:26.337 --> 35:28.999
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

35:29.173 --> 35:33.667
It's the same m.o. As before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

35:33.845 --> 35:37.246
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

35:38.316 --> 35:39.305
V?

35:46.290 --> 35:48.258
My fat, metal friend.

36:00.905 --> 36:02.805
Mondego.

36:08.779 --> 36:11.509
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

36:12.049 --> 36:15.348
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.817
My favorite film:

36:16.988 --> 36:21.448
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

36:21.626 --> 36:24.857
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,</i>
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

36:26.264 --> 36:27.629
It gets me every time.

36:28.032 --> 36:29.829
- Never seen it.
- Really?

36:30.535 --> 36:33.265
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

36:33.604 --> 36:35.697
As only celluloid can deliver.

36:36.073 --> 36:37.563
Okay.

36:38.376 --> 36:39.707
Put the sword away.

36:40.244 --> 36:42.144
Forensics just wrapped.

36:42.680 --> 36:45.979
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

36:46.150 --> 36:47.981
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

36:48.152 --> 36:50.211
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

36:50.388 --> 36:51.946
- Interesting.
- Why?

36:52.123 --> 36:55.524
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

36:55.693 --> 36:57.456
...before he was
the Voice of London?

36:57.628 --> 37:00.096
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

37:00.264 --> 37:03.028
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.432
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

37:07.605 --> 37:11.132
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

37:11.943 --> 37:13.638
<i>May we come up?</i>

37:14.679 --> 37:17.341
<i>- You find your own tree.</i>
- You find your own tree.

37:22.753 --> 37:24.846
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

37:25.623 --> 37:28.854
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

37:29.994 --> 37:32.861
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

37:34.732 --> 37:37.565
<i>- Nationwide were devastated</i>
<i>as news of the most popular...</i>

37:37.735 --> 37:38.963
Wait. What's this?

37:39.136 --> 37:41.832
<i>- Most awarded stars</i>
<i>in the history of the BTN...</i>

37:42.006 --> 37:45.100
<i>... a man known to the entire nation</i>
<i>as "The Voice of London"...</i>

37:45.276 --> 37:48.074
<i>... passed away late last night</i>
<i>from apparent heart failure.</i>

37:49.513 --> 37:52.505
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

37:52.683 --> 37:55.675
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

37:55.853 --> 37:58.014
<i>It came as no surprise</i>
<i>to those who knew him...</i>

37:58.189 --> 37:59.918
<i>... that his body was at his office...</i>

38:00.091 --> 38:03.822
<i>... where he often worked long hours</i>
<i>after everyone else had gone home.</i>

38:03.995 --> 38:06.520
<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

38:13.004 --> 38:16.201
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

38:16.374 --> 38:18.069
You didn't take it, did you?

38:18.643 --> 38:21.271
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

38:23.047 --> 38:25.208
Did you have anything to do with that?

38:25.383 --> 38:28.318
- Yes, I killed him.
- You...

38:28.486 --> 38:29.953
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

38:30.121 --> 38:32.589
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

38:32.757 --> 38:36.158
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

38:36.327 --> 38:38.795
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

38:39.163 --> 38:41.723
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

38:44.535 --> 38:48.164
Oh, I see.

38:48.506 --> 38:51.134
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

38:52.610 --> 38:54.635
And are you going to kill more people?

38:56.047 --> 38:57.446
Yes.

38:58.082 --> 38:59.913
Take a look at this.

39:00.084 --> 39:02.552
Prothero's military record.

39:03.454 --> 39:04.887
What do you see?

39:05.790 --> 39:12.025
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

39:12.196 --> 39:13.788
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

39:13.964 --> 39:17.627
...they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

39:17.802 --> 39:20.600
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

39:21.839 --> 39:24.740
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

39:24.909 --> 39:28.777
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

39:29.146 --> 39:33.276
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

39:33.451 --> 39:38.787
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

39:38.956 --> 39:42.323
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

39:42.493 --> 39:46.020
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

39:46.197 --> 39:48.722
...approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

39:48.899 --> 39:50.025
Well, there you have it.

39:52.002 --> 39:54.527
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

39:54.705 --> 39:57.868
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

39:58.209 --> 40:00.370
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

40:00.544 --> 40:03.308
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

40:03.848 --> 40:06.578
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

40:06.751 --> 40:09.652
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

40:09.820 --> 40:13.017
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

40:13.190 --> 40:17.718
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

40:17.895 --> 40:19.829
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

40:19.997 --> 40:23.865
Before you go any further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

40:24.502 --> 40:26.732
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

40:26.904 --> 40:29.498
We all did what we had to do.

40:29.673 --> 40:32.904
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

40:33.077 --> 40:34.908
That's all I have to say about that.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.017
You can do this.

40:53.164 --> 40:54.597
Hi.

40:55.766 --> 40:57.757
I've been thinking...

40:59.336 --> 41:01.099
There's something I want to ask you...

41:01.272 --> 41:05.106
...but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

41:07.478 --> 41:10.879
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

41:11.782 --> 41:14.216
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth...

41:14.385 --> 41:16.819
...while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

41:16.987 --> 41:19.148
A man after my own heart.

41:19.323 --> 41:21.985
He always told the best stories.

41:23.227 --> 41:25.457
Until my brother died.

41:27.898 --> 41:29.763
That was when everything changed.

41:30.634 --> 41:34.092
<i>My brother was one of the students</i>
<i>at St. Mary's.</i>

41:34.271 --> 41:38.105
<i>After he died,</i>
<i>my parents became political.</i>

41:40.044 --> 41:43.673
<i>They protested the war</i>
<i>and the Reclamation.</i>

41:43.848 --> 41:48.512
<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,</i>
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

41:48.686 --> 41:50.654
<i>I watched on the television...</i>

41:50.821 --> 41:53.255
<i>... thinking I was going</i>
<i>to see my parents killed.</i>

41:53.824 --> 41:56.292
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

41:56.460 --> 41:59.793
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.</i>
<i>Dad refused.</i>

41:59.964 --> 42:02.990
<i>He said if we ran away, they would win.</i>

42:03.167 --> 42:04.964
<i>Win, like...</i>

42:05.135 --> 42:06.830
<i>... it was a game.</i>

42:09.106 --> 42:10.471
Evey, quick, hide!

42:25.456 --> 42:27.390
- Mummy!
- Evey!

42:27.558 --> 42:28.957
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

42:29.493 --> 42:33.293
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

42:33.664 --> 42:35.222
I'm sorry, Evey.

42:35.399 --> 42:37.993
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

42:38.168 --> 42:40.466
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

42:40.638 --> 42:43.630
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

42:45.009 --> 42:46.499
...but I'm not.

42:47.211 --> 42:50.374
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

42:52.149 --> 42:53.514
...but I am.

42:53.684 --> 42:57.245
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

42:57.421 --> 43:02.222
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

43:03.494 --> 43:05.359
...please let me know.

43:05.529 --> 43:07.190
If you wish.

43:14.838 --> 43:17.398
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

43:17.574 --> 43:19.098
Worth a shot.

43:19.843 --> 43:22.038
One thing is true of all governments:

43:22.212 --> 43:26.012
The most reliable records
are tax records.

43:32.523 --> 43:35.822
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

43:35.993 --> 43:39.895
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

43:40.064 --> 43:44.057
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

43:44.234 --> 43:46.498
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

43:46.670 --> 43:49.138
Thanks. This is a great help.

44:00.551 --> 44:04.078
"By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

44:04.254 --> 44:07.382
- Personal motto?
- From <i>Faust.</i>

44:07.558 --> 44:09.992
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

44:10.160 --> 44:12.321
It is. And speaking of the devil...

44:12.496 --> 44:15.260
...I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

44:15.432 --> 44:17.764
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

44:17.935 --> 44:20.733
...have accelerated my original plan.

44:20.904 --> 44:24.635
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

44:24.808 --> 44:26.070
I'll do my best.

44:26.577 --> 44:28.340
I believe you will.

44:31.682 --> 44:36.813
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

44:36.987 --> 44:38.887
I don't know, but this is interesting.

44:39.056 --> 44:42.514
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

44:42.693 --> 44:45.787
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

44:45.963 --> 44:49.797
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

44:50.634 --> 44:52.192
Now, that is interesting.

44:53.704 --> 44:56.764
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

45:00.177 --> 45:02.145
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

45:02.312 --> 45:04.007
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

45:04.181 --> 45:06.308
I've just received your InterLink itinerary.

45:06.483 --> 45:09.350
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

45:09.520 --> 45:11.010
You're most diligent, Denis...

45:11.188 --> 45:15.147
...a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

45:15.325 --> 45:17.885
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

45:18.062 --> 45:21.088
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

45:21.765 --> 45:23.494
My last little joy.

45:23.667 --> 45:25.430
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

45:26.637 --> 45:29.936
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

45:30.107 --> 45:33.338
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

45:33.510 --> 45:34.909
Older?

45:35.079 --> 45:37.240
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

45:37.414 --> 45:39.644
That is for Your Grace to decide.

45:51.795 --> 45:54.423
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

45:56.033 --> 46:01.027
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

46:02.973 --> 46:05.635
Mea culpa, my child.

46:05.809 --> 46:07.071
Mea culpa.

46:12.716 --> 46:16.117
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

46:16.286 --> 46:20.313
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

46:20.824 --> 46:22.382
Tell me your sins.

46:22.559 --> 46:24.390
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

46:24.561 --> 46:26.859
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

46:27.131 --> 46:28.792
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

46:28.966 --> 46:31.526
...because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

46:31.702 --> 46:35.365
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

46:35.539 --> 46:38.633
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

46:38.809 --> 46:40.674
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

46:40.844 --> 46:44.041
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

46:44.214 --> 46:47.513
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

46:47.718 --> 46:51.051
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

46:51.221 --> 46:53.519
Wonderful!

46:53.690 --> 46:55.988
It's a game I've never played!

46:56.160 --> 47:00.119
What a delightful mind you have.
I hope the rest of you is just as interesting.

47:00.297 --> 47:03.562
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

47:03.734 --> 47:05.827
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

47:06.003 --> 47:07.436
Stop it! Get off of me!

47:07.738 --> 47:09.729
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

47:09.907 --> 47:12.000
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

47:14.111 --> 47:17.080
You little bitch. You fucking little whore!

47:20.017 --> 47:21.609
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

47:21.785 --> 47:23.480
She wasn't lying. It is you.

47:23.654 --> 47:25.679
I'm sorry.

47:25.856 --> 47:27.551
- I had to.
- Evey!

47:32.329 --> 47:34.456
And thus I clothe my naked villainy...

47:34.631 --> 47:37.657
...with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ...

47:37.834 --> 47:40.962
...and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

47:41.138 --> 47:43.106
Oh, please, have mercy.

47:43.307 --> 47:45.207
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

47:45.375 --> 47:47.070
<i>Not tonight.</i>

47:49.613 --> 47:51.171
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

47:51.348 --> 47:53.509
Well, then. Children's hour at the abbey.

47:53.684 --> 47:55.675
<i>Open your mouth</i>
<i>and stick out your tongue.</i>

47:55.852 --> 47:59.185
- What the...?
<i>- I don't want to die!</i>

48:00.023 --> 48:02.617
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

48:05.329 --> 48:09.095
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

48:09.266 --> 48:10.927
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

48:11.301 --> 48:13.667
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

48:14.438 --> 48:17.134
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

48:21.845 --> 48:23.278
Creedy.

48:23.580 --> 48:24.808
What are you doing here?

48:25.782 --> 48:29.843
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

48:30.020 --> 48:34.252
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

48:34.424 --> 48:37.222
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

48:37.394 --> 48:40.420
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

48:40.597 --> 48:43.794
The security of information
is paramount.

48:44.334 --> 48:45.801
In these volatile times...

48:45.969 --> 48:48.802
...mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

48:48.972 --> 48:51.338
...if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

48:51.508 --> 48:53.772
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

48:53.944 --> 48:56.538
...a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

48:56.713 --> 48:59.511
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

48:59.916 --> 49:02.214
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

49:02.386 --> 49:04.149
At this time, it would behoove you...

49:04.321 --> 49:09.315
...to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

49:09.493 --> 49:12.894
...and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

49:13.563 --> 49:14.860
You mean Larkhill?

49:15.032 --> 49:18.593
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

49:18.769 --> 49:22.034
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

49:23.240 --> 49:26.141
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

49:26.810 --> 49:29.938
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

49:31.581 --> 49:33.811
I've been a party member for 27 years.

49:33.984 --> 49:36.282
If I were you, chief inspector...

49:36.453 --> 49:38.614
...l'd find the terrorist...

49:38.789 --> 49:40.757
...and I'd find him soon.

49:44.094 --> 49:45.618
Please.

49:49.866 --> 49:51.925
Evey? Good God!

49:52.102 --> 49:54.627
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

49:56.606 --> 49:59.598
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

50:08.118 --> 50:10.746
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

50:10.921 --> 50:13.583
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

50:13.757 --> 50:16.157
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

50:16.326 --> 50:17.816
Evey, listen to me.

50:17.994 --> 50:21.862
If the government ever searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

50:26.069 --> 50:27.696
You trusted me.

50:27.871 --> 50:30.931
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

50:44.221 --> 50:46.712
Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen</i>.

50:46.890 --> 50:49.586
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

50:49.793 --> 50:53.820
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

50:53.997 --> 50:56.795
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

50:56.967 --> 50:58.798
...it always cheers me up.

51:00.937 --> 51:04.964
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

51:05.142 --> 51:07.303
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

51:08.111 --> 51:09.510
But why would you keep it?

51:09.679 --> 51:12.910
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

51:13.083 --> 51:15.051
Is it worth it?
If they found that here...

51:15.218 --> 51:17.516
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

51:18.155 --> 51:20.123
Thank you, Gordon.

51:20.290 --> 51:22.417
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

51:22.592 --> 51:26.050
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

51:26.229 --> 51:28.424
I was on my way here, and...

51:30.233 --> 51:31.700
Yes.

51:34.905 --> 51:37.430
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

51:38.308 --> 51:39.741
- But...
- You're wondering why...

51:39.910 --> 51:42.470
...you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

51:42.646 --> 51:46.707
...if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

51:46.883 --> 51:50.444
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

51:50.620 --> 51:53.214
...young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

51:53.423 --> 51:57.189
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

51:57.360 --> 52:01.319
...I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a television show.

52:01.498 --> 52:04.467
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

52:05.802 --> 52:07.667
The truth is, after so many years...

52:07.838 --> 52:11.274
...you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

52:11.441 --> 52:15.468
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

52:17.013 --> 52:21.279
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

52:21.451 --> 52:24.477
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

52:25.689 --> 52:27.213
Thanks, Delia.

52:28.024 --> 52:31.391
Any leads on finding this guy?

52:31.561 --> 52:34.894
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

52:37.667 --> 52:40.693
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

52:42.172 --> 52:44.572
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

52:46.076 --> 52:48.408
They're believed to be extinct.

52:49.913 --> 52:51.505
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

52:52.148 --> 52:54.378
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

52:54.584 --> 52:57.109
Any information could be helpful.

52:57.921 --> 52:59.445
Of course.

53:00.857 --> 53:02.256
Excuse me.

53:03.026 --> 53:04.220
Yeah?

53:04.394 --> 53:08.660
<i>I just finished going through the file,</i>
<i>inspector. You better get back here.</i>

53:08.832 --> 53:10.299
Yeah, okay.

53:12.068 --> 53:15.162
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

53:16.306 --> 53:18.797
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

53:18.975 --> 53:21.535
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

53:21.711 --> 53:25.203
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

53:25.382 --> 53:27.976
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

53:28.585 --> 53:30.018
Running away?

53:30.186 --> 53:34.350
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

53:34.524 --> 53:36.924
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

53:37.093 --> 53:40.153
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

53:40.330 --> 53:43.663
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

53:56.046 --> 53:57.445
What? Are you sure about that?

53:57.948 --> 53:59.347
Okay. Thank you.

54:00.317 --> 54:03.718
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

54:04.054 --> 54:06.147
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

54:06.957 --> 54:08.424
Jesus, I just saw her.

54:17.467 --> 54:19.298
It's you, isn't it?

54:19.970 --> 54:23.030
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

54:24.507 --> 54:26.407
Thank God.

54:28.545 --> 54:31.013
<i>I'm sorry, I can't get a response</i>
<i>from that number.</i>

54:31.181 --> 54:33.115
<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

54:33.283 --> 54:35.114
Jesus Christ.

54:35.652 --> 54:37.085
He's there.

54:38.154 --> 54:41.555
After what happened,
after what they did...

54:41.992 --> 54:44.051
...I thought about killing myself.

54:46.363 --> 54:49.423
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

54:50.734 --> 54:52.929
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

54:53.737 --> 54:55.329
I swear to you.

54:55.672 --> 54:57.139
Read my journal.

54:57.307 --> 55:00.538
What they did was only possible
because of you.

55:02.245 --> 55:06.011
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

55:06.182 --> 55:09.015
He changed the entire course
of human history.

55:10.253 --> 55:12.847
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

55:13.056 --> 55:16.184
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

55:16.359 --> 55:18.224
I've come for what you did.

55:19.796 --> 55:21.024
It's funny.

55:21.197 --> 55:24.030
I was given one of your roses today.

55:25.268 --> 55:28.499
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

55:30.674 --> 55:34.337
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

55:35.412 --> 55:38.006
There are no coincidences, Delia.

55:38.181 --> 55:41.150
Only the illusion of coincidence.

55:41.317 --> 55:43.308
I have another rose.

55:44.521 --> 55:46.853
And this one is for you.

55:52.429 --> 55:56.365
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago...

55:57.133 --> 55:58.930
...while you slept.

55:59.969 --> 56:02.665
- Is there any pain?
- No.

56:02.939 --> 56:04.304
Thank you.

56:06.710 --> 56:09.838
Is it meaningless to apologize?

56:10.280 --> 56:11.372
Never.

56:12.582 --> 56:14.550
I'm so sorry.

56:36.172 --> 56:37.901
Damn it.

56:40.410 --> 56:43.243
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

56:43.413 --> 56:46.974
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

56:47.150 --> 56:50.176
<i>Am I to understand that you have read</i>
<i>this document, inspector?</i>

56:50.386 --> 56:52.445
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Has anyone else read it?</i>

56:52.622 --> 56:55.489
- No, sir.
<i>- Then let me make this perfectly clear to you.</i>

56:55.692 --> 56:59.150
<i>The contents of this document</i>
<i>are a matter of national security...</i>

56:59.329 --> 57:03.197
<i>... constituting an assault on the character</i>
<i>of several important party members...</i>

57:03.566 --> 57:06.831
<i>... as well as a blatant violation</i>
<i>of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

57:07.003 --> 57:09.904
<i>As the authenticity of this document</i>
<i>cannot be verified...</i>

57:10.073 --> 57:13.907
<i>... it could be an elaborate forgery</i>
<i>created by the terrorist...</i>

57:14.077 --> 57:17.774
<i>... as easily as it could be the deranged</i>
<i>fantasy of a former party member...</i>

57:17.947 --> 57:20.108
<i>... who resigned</i>
<i>for psychological reasons.</i>

57:20.617 --> 57:23.177
<i>Any discussion of this document</i>
<i>or its contents...</i>

57:23.353 --> 57:26.288
<i>... will be regarded, at the very least,</i>
<i>as an act of sedition...</i>

57:26.456 --> 57:28.924
<i>... if not a willful act of treason.</i>

57:29.092 --> 57:32.425
<i>- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Yes, sir.

57:32.595 --> 57:35.291
<i>You would do well, inspector...</i>

57:35.465 --> 57:37.865
<i>... to put it out of your mind.</i>

57:47.010 --> 57:48.773
<i>May 23rd.</i>

57:50.146 --> 57:53.013
<i>My first batch of subjects arrived today...</i>

57:54.050 --> 57:56.917
<i>... and I have to admit</i>
<i>that I'm very excited.</i>

58:00.056 --> 58:02.889
<i>This could be the dawn of a new age.</i>

58:03.893 --> 58:05.827
<i>Nuclear power is meaningless...</i>

58:05.995 --> 58:08.964
<i>... in a world where a virus</i>
<i>can kill an entire population...</i>

58:09.132 --> 58:11.191
<i>... and leave its wealth intact.</i>

58:11.367 --> 58:14.495
- Stay together!
- Come on, move!

58:14.971 --> 58:16.962
<i>May 27th.</i>

58:17.140 --> 58:20.268
<i>Commander Prothero toured the lab</i>
<i>with a priest, Father Lilliman...</i>

58:20.443 --> 58:24.277
<i>... who I was told is here to monitor</i>
<i>for Rules and Rights violations.</i>

58:24.447 --> 58:28.713
<i>It made me nervous, but the commander</i>
<i>assured me there wouldn't be a problem.</i>

58:28.918 --> 58:30.749
<i>June 2nd.</i>

58:31.387 --> 58:35.118
<i>I keep wondering if these people knew</i>
<i>how they might be helping their country...</i>

58:35.291 --> 58:37.623
<i>... if they would act any differently.</i>

58:37.794 --> 58:41.730
<i>They're so weak and pathetic.</i>
<i>They never look you in the eye.</i>

58:41.898 --> 58:44.366
<i>I find myself hating them.</i>

58:47.470 --> 58:49.404
<i>August the 18th.</i>

58:49.572 --> 58:53.338
<i>Of the original four dozen,</i>
<i>over 75 percent are now deceased.</i>

58:55.845 --> 58:59.110
<i>No controllable pattern has yet emerged.</i>

59:00.817 --> 59:02.614
<i>September the 18th.</i>

59:02.785 --> 59:05.845
<i>There is one case that continues</i>
<i>to give me hope.</i>

59:06.022 --> 59:10.686
<i>He exhibits none of the immune-system</i>
<i>pathologies the other subjects developed.</i>

59:10.860 --> 59:15.354
<i>I've discovered cellular anomalies in his</i>
<i>blood that I've been unable to categorize.</i>

59:15.531 --> 59:17.362
<i>The mutations seem to have triggered...</i>

59:17.533 --> 59:21.492
<i>... the abnormal development</i>
<i>of basic kinesthesia and reflexes.</i>

59:21.671 --> 59:23.832
<i>The subject said</i>
<i>he could no longer remember...</i>

59:24.007 --> 59:26.737
<i>... who he was or where he was from.</i>

59:26.910 --> 59:30.676
<i>Whoever he was,</i>
<i>he is now the key to our dream...</i>

59:30.847 --> 59:34.374
<i>... and the hope that all of this</i>
<i>will not have been in vain.</i>

59:35.652 --> 59:37.142
<i>November the 5th.</i>

59:39.622 --> 59:42.785
<i>It started last night, around midnight.</i>

59:42.959 --> 59:46.827
<i>The first explosions tore open</i>
<i>the entire medical section.</i>

59:48.031 --> 59:50.829
<i>All my work, gone.</i>

59:51.000 --> 59:55.027
<i>I was trying to understand how</i>
<i>it could've happened when I saw him.</i>

59:55.204 --> 59:57.434
<i>The man from room 5.</i>

59:57.607 --> 59:58.835
<i>He looked at me.</i>

59:59.008 --> 01:00:02.444
<i>Not with eyes. There were no eyes.</i>

01:00:02.612 --> 01:00:05.137
<i>But I know he was looking at me</i>
<i>because I felt it.</i>

01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:14.714
<i>Oh, God...</i>

01:00:14.891 --> 01:00:16.620
<i>... what have I done?</i>

01:00:48.758 --> 01:00:50.191
What is that you're making?

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.885
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:54.893
- This is weird.
- What?

01:00:55.064 --> 01:00:58.522
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:00.999
- Really?
- I swear.

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:05.937
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:08.043
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

01:01:08.378 --> 01:01:10.039
I am V.

01:01:10.213 --> 01:01:11.680
At last you know the truth.

01:01:12.181 --> 01:01:13.546
You're stunned, I know.

01:01:13.716 --> 01:01:17.345
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.719
...there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

01:01:24.627 --> 01:01:26.026
That is not funny, Gordon.

01:01:26.195 --> 01:01:28.857
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

01:01:29.465 --> 01:01:31.592
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

01:01:31.768 --> 01:01:33.668
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

01:01:34.804 --> 01:01:37.204
There is something wrong
with this country.

01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:54.779
Morning, inspector.

01:01:56.526 --> 01:01:58.289
You're at it early.

01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:03.525
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

01:02:11.808 --> 01:02:14.299
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

01:02:15.678 --> 01:02:18.044
I don't care if you answer me or not.

01:02:19.015 --> 01:02:21.210
I just wanna say this aloud.

01:02:22.485 --> 01:02:26.251
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

01:02:26.422 --> 01:02:28.720
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

01:02:29.826 --> 01:02:31.225
Because of the terrorist?

01:02:32.695 --> 01:02:34.026
No.

01:02:35.198 --> 01:02:38.292
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:44.562
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

01:02:45.508 --> 01:02:46.873
...and Three Waters.

01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:53.448
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

01:02:53.616 --> 01:02:56.414
...the question I have to ask, is:

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:00.821
What if the worst...

01:03:01.524 --> 01:03:05.085
...the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:09.027
...was not the work
of religious extremists?

01:03:09.198 --> 01:03:12.861
Well, I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

01:03:13.035 --> 01:03:15.162
And they were executed. I know.

01:03:15.338 --> 01:03:18.330
And maybe that's really what happened.

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:23.270
But I see this chain of events...

01:03:24.614 --> 01:03:28.311
...these coincidences,
and I have to ask:

01:03:28.484 --> 01:03:33.080
What if that isn't what happened?
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

01:03:33.256 --> 01:03:37.317
What if someone else
killed all those people?

01:03:37.493 --> 01:03:39.791
Would you really wanna know
who it was?

01:03:40.796 --> 01:03:42.229
Sure.

01:03:42.398 --> 01:03:44.730
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

01:03:46.669 --> 01:03:48.227
That's my question.

01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:51.468
If our own government was responsible...

01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:55.941
...for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

01:03:57.914 --> 01:04:04.285
...if our own government was responsible
for the deaths of almost 100,000 people...

01:04:07.256 --> 01:04:08.917
...would you really wanna know?

01:04:09.325 --> 01:04:11.555
<i>This has to be the bloody coldest</i>
<i>March in years.</i>

01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:14.127
<i>Keep talking like that,</i>
<i>we'll lose our party status.</i>

01:04:14.297 --> 01:04:18.028
<i>- They're a pack of lying, greedy hypocrites!</i>
<i>- Keep it down, will you?</i>

01:04:21.938 --> 01:04:25.169
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

01:04:25.374 --> 01:04:28.571
...80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

01:04:29.312 --> 01:04:31.507
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:35.139
...over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

01:04:35.318 --> 01:04:38.810
<i>- Mr. Creedy?</i>
- We're handling it as best we can.

01:04:38.988 --> 01:04:41.650
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

01:04:41.824 --> 01:04:44.292
<i>I want more than arrests. I want results.</i>

01:04:48.164 --> 01:04:50.689
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:52.993
Celebrating what?

01:04:53.169 --> 01:04:56.195
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

01:04:56.372 --> 01:04:58.169
<i>Very good evening,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:02.640
<i>Listen, we've got an extraordinary</i>
<i>show for you tonight.</i>

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:06.210
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, I don't think I do.</i>

01:05:06.382 --> 01:05:08.873
<i>Will you please give</i>
<i>a very warm welcome...</i>

01:05:09.051 --> 01:05:12.452
<i>... to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler!</i>

01:05:16.959 --> 01:05:18.517
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

01:05:20.363 --> 01:05:23.890
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.658
Oh, my God.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.943
<i>Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor...</i>

01:05:40.116 --> 01:05:42.949
<i>... I understand you've been under</i>
<i>tremendous strain lately...</i>

01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:46.247
<i>... since the beginning</i>
<i>of this whole terrorism business...</i>

01:05:46.422 --> 01:05:50.518
<i>... and we thought it would be a nice idea</i>
<i>to try and help you relax. Girls?</i>

01:05:56.699 --> 01:05:59.964
<i>Warm milk. There's nothing better.</i>

01:06:00.136 --> 01:06:03.162
<i>I understand you enjoy a glass</i>
<i>every night, chancellor.</i>

01:06:03.339 --> 01:06:05.136
<i>Since I was a boy.</i>

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:07.800
<i>But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich.</i>

01:06:07.977 --> 01:06:11.743
<i>- The terrorist was never a serious concern.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

01:06:11.914 --> 01:06:14.144
<i>- Chancellor, chancellor...</i>
- It's him.

01:06:14.317 --> 01:06:17.548
<i>Are you saying that he's not still alive</i>
<i>and active?</i>

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.382
<i>The terrorist has been neutralized.</i>

01:06:22.058 --> 01:06:24.754
<i>Oh, my God! Chancellor, look!</i>

01:06:24.927 --> 01:06:26.554
<i>The terrorist!</i>

01:06:27.129 --> 01:06:28.653
<i>The terrorist!</i>

01:06:30.399 --> 01:06:32.094
<i>Get him!</i>

01:06:34.537 --> 01:06:36.630
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

01:06:55.858 --> 01:06:57.416
<i>At last!</i>

01:06:57.593 --> 01:07:01.529
<i>And now, for all the world to see.</i>

01:07:02.698 --> 01:07:03.926
It's him!

01:07:05.101 --> 01:07:09.094
<i>Unhand me! I am your chancellor!</i>

01:07:09.271 --> 01:07:12.968
<i>How dare you! I am the chancellor!</i>

01:07:13.275 --> 01:07:15.209
<i>Imposter!</i>

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:23.845
<i>Soldiers! That man is the terrorist!</i>

01:07:24.019 --> 01:07:26.954
<i>- I order you to shoot that traitor!</i>
<i>- Liar!</i>

01:07:27.123 --> 01:07:28.147
<i>- Faker!</i>
<i>- Fraud!</i>

01:07:28.324 --> 01:07:30.189
<i>- Ready!</i>
<i>- Aim!</i>

01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:31.826
<i>- Fire!</i>
<i>- Fire!</i>

01:07:43.706 --> 01:07:45.697
What are they gonna do, fine us?

01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:49.333
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

01:07:49.512 --> 01:07:52.003
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:54.046
Protect me.

01:07:54.216 --> 01:07:56.047
I should've hired him
to be my mother.

01:07:56.218 --> 01:07:58.982
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

01:07:59.155 --> 01:08:02.147
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

01:08:02.324 --> 01:08:05.555
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

01:08:05.728 --> 01:08:08.925
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

01:08:09.098 --> 01:08:14.161
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.725
Gordon?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.997
Quick, Evey, hide!

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:45.317
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.330
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.917
Do you know why you're here,
Evey Hammond?

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.419
Please.

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.992
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:03.021
...the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:08.102
...treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:14.708
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:18.836
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.880
...of code name V.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:24.178
If your information leads
to his capture...

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:28.153
...you will be released
from this facility immediately.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.918
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:34.188
You can return to your life,
Miss Hammond.

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:38.699
All you have to do is cooperate.

01:10:43.139 --> 01:10:44.697
Process her.

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:55.165
<i>I know there's no way I can convince you</i>
<i>this is not one of their tricks...</i>

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:56.737
<i>... but I don't care.</i>

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.703
<i>I am me.</i>

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.603
<i>My name is Valerie.</i>

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:05.804
<i>I don't think I'll live much longer,</i>
<i>and I wanted to tell someone about my life.</i>

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:10.385
<i>This is the only autobiography</i>
<i>that I will ever write and, God...</i>

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:13.286
<i>... I'm writing it on toilet paper.</i>

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.956
<i>I was born in Nottingham in 1985.</i>

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:23.929
<i>I don't remember much of those early years,</i>
<i>but I do remember the rain.</i>

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.568
<i>My grandmother owned a farm</i>
<i>in Tottle Brook...</i>

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.603
<i>... and she used to tell me</i>
<i>that God was in the rain.</i>

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:32.536
<i>I passed my 11 Plus</i>
<i>and went to girls' grammar.</i>

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:35.438
<i>It was at school</i>
<i>that I met my first girlfriend.</i>

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.203
<i>Her name was Sarah.</i>

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:39.405
<i>It was her wrists.</i>

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.209
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.151
<i>I thought we would</i>
<i>love each other forever.</i>

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:49.017
<i>I remember our teacher telling us...</i>

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:51.887
<i>... that it was an adolescent phase</i>
<i>that people outgrew.</i>

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:53.619
<i>Sarah did.</i>

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.995
<i>I didn't.</i>

01:13:57.199 --> 01:14:01.329
<i>In 2002, I fell in love</i>
<i>with a girl named Christina.</i>

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:03.699
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:07.536
<i>I couldn't have done it</i>
<i>without Chris holding my hand.</i>

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:12.875
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.</i>
<i>He told me to go and never come back.</i>

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:14.710
<i>My mother said nothing.</i>

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:19.610
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.</i>
<i>Was that so selfish?</i>

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:24.591
<i>Our integrity sells for so little,</i>
<i>but it is all we really have.</i>

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.921
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.663
<i>But within that inch...</i>

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.060
<i>... we are free.</i>

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:35.396
It ends whenever you want it to.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:38.165
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.244
<i>I'd always known</i>
<i>what I wanted to do with my life...</i>

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:22.612
<i>... and in 2015 I starred in my first film,</i>
The Salt Flats.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:27.582
<i>It was the most important role of my life.</i>
<i>Not because of my career...</i>

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:29.748
<i>... but because that was how I met Ruth.</i>

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:33.686
<i>The first time we kissed...</i>

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:38.629
<i>... I knew I never wanted to kiss</i>
<i>any other lips but hers again.</i>

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:47.907
<i>We moved to a small flat</i>
<i>in London together.</i>

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:50.602
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me</i>
<i>in our window box...</i>

01:15:51.614 --> 01:15:54.344
<i>... and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.846
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:06.995
<i>But America's war grew worse and worse,</i>
<i>and eventually came to London.</i>

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:10.291
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler...

01:16:10.466 --> 01:16:13.401
...to close the remaining tube stations
passed with...

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.402
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:18.303
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:20.567
You won't last much longer.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.404
You're gonna die here.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.638
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:39.859
<i>I remember how the meaning of words</i>
<i>began to change.</i>

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:46.558
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"</i>
<i>and "rendition" became frightening...</i>

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:52.004
<i>... while things like "Norsefire" and the</i>
<i>"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.899
<i>I remember how "different"</i>
<i>became dangerous.</i>

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:58.603
<i>I still don't understand it...</i>

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.840
<i>... why they hate us so much.</i>

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:09.283
<i>They took Ruth</i>
<i>while she was out buying food.</i>

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:14.588
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.359
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

01:17:26.175 --> 01:17:30.202
<i>It seems strange that my life should end</i>
<i>in such a terrible place.</i>

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:35.783
<i>But for three years,</i>
<i>I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:40.213
<i>I shall die here.</i>

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:43.916
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:45.788
<i>Every inch...</i>

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.657
<i>... but one.</i>

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.461
<i>An inch.</i>

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:56.796
<i>It is small, and it is fragile...</i>

01:17:56.972 --> 01:18:00.669
<i>... and it is the only thing</i>
<i>in the world worth having.</i>

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:05.940
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.</i>
<i>We must never let them take it from us.</i>

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:11.084
<i>I hope that, whoever you are,</i>
<i>you escape this place.</i>

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:14.450
<i>I hope that the world turns</i>
<i>and that things get better.</i>

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:19.553
<i>But what I hope most of all</i>
<i>is that you understand what I mean...</i>

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:22.925
<i>... when I tell you that</i>
<i>even though I do not know you...</i>

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:25.828
<i>... and even though</i>
<i>I may never meet you...</i>

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.266
<i>... laugh with you, cry with you...</i>

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.372
<i>... or kiss you...</i>

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.638
<i>... I love you.</i>

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:36.334
<i>With all my heart...</i>

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:38.546
<i>... I love you.</i>

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:41.615
<i>Valerie.</i>

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:59.063
I'm instructed to inform you that you
have been convicted by special tribunal...

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:04.194
...and that unless you are ready to offer
your cooperation, you are to be executed.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:08.139
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:11.976
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:18.051
- No.
- Very well.

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:22.886
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:25.516
Arrange a detail of six men...

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:28.663
...and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

01:19:44.647 --> 01:19:45.909
It's time.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.015
I'm ready.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.449
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.886
Just give them something, anything.

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.258
Thank you...

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:01.419
...but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:05.897
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.235
What?

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.983
Hello, Evey.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.824
You.

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:46.832
- It was you?
- Yeah.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:48.931
That wasn't real?

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:55.366
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:56.976
I thought they'd arrest him...

01:21:57.146 --> 01:22:00.411
...but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.573
Oh, God.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:06.813
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:10.388
You did this to me?

01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:13.427
You cut my hair?

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.360
You tortured me?

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:19.030
You tortured me.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:21.797
Why?

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:27.408
You said you wanted to live without fear.
I wish there'd been an easier way...

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:29.635
...but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:31.712
I know you may never forgive me...

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:34.943
...but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:38.177
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:40.748
Every day, I wanted to end it.

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:44.518
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:47.423
You're sick! You're evil!

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:51.055
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:54.201
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:57.930
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:00.666
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.334
...taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:07.073
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:09.183
But then something happened.

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:11.751
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.787
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

01:23:14.957 --> 01:23:18.723
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:20.657
Yes, I created a lie.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:24.424
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.001
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.230
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:34.000
I can't feel anything anymore!

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:37.907
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:40.878
I can't... Can't breathe.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:45.750
Asthma. When I was little...

01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:49.415
Listen to me, Evey.

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:53.186
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:58.791
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:04.831
They put you in a cell and took everything
they could take except your life.

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:07.908
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.806
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:14.642
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:18.650
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.153
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:25.184
...you told them you'd rather die.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:27.285
You faced your death, Evey.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.425
You were calm. You were still.

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:32.999
Try to feel now what you felt then.

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:41.142
Oh, God.

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:44.976
I felt...

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:47.080
Yes?

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.848
I'm dizzy.

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.112
I need air.

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:56.519
Please, I need to be outside.

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.751
There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:18.813
God is in the rain.

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.011
V.

01:26:26.048 --> 01:26:27.515
I'm leaving.

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:33.512
There are 872 songs in here.

01:26:34.423 --> 01:26:37.586
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:40.887
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

01:26:41.063 --> 01:26:42.530
I can't stay here.

01:26:44.066 --> 01:26:45.590
I know.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:50.304
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:53.434
I thought about keeping this...

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:57.100
...but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:04.551
I didn't.

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:08.781
May I show you something
before you go?

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:22.128
- She was real.
- Yes.

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:24.033
She's beautiful.

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:27.334
- Did you know her?
- No.

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:30.177
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:33.212
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:35.311
Then it really happened, didn't it?

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:38.542
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:43.749
And that's what this is all about.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:47.019
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:50.893
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:52.966
It's a basic principle of the universe...

01:27:53.135 --> 01:27:56.070
...that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:57.637
Is that how you see it?

01:27:57.806 --> 01:28:00.274
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:02.501
And they created a monster.

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:16.182
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.853
That would have scared me before...

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.723
...but I suppose I should thank you.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:34.935
Thank you.

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:39.071
Goodbye.

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:42.944
Evey...

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:46.921
...may I ask you for something?

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:51.889
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:53.788
...before the 5th.

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:58.699
- All right.
- Thank you.

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:23.653
Chancellor, I know no one seems
to want to discuss this...

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:26.259
...but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

01:29:26.428 --> 01:29:29.329
...then it can't be ignored any longer.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:34.025
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.635
Now, it concludes that...

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:39.205
...the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:41.774
...would be an airborne attack.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.570
A separate report has been filed...

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:47.579
...suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:49.307
...have been sealed shut.

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:51.452
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:54.179
Chief Inspector Finch.

01:29:54.356 --> 01:29:57.257
<i>Do you have any evidence</i>
<i>to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

01:29:57.459 --> 01:29:59.984
No, sir. Just a feeling.

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:02.129
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector...</i>

01:30:02.297 --> 01:30:06.461
<i>... it is that this government will not survive</i>
<i>if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:09.570
<i>Mr. Dascomb,</i>
<i>what we need right now...</i>

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:12.798
<i>... is a clear message</i>
<i>to the people of this country.</i>

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.306
<i>This message must be read</i>
<i>in every newspaper...</i>

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:18.002
<i>... heard on every radio,</i>
<i>seen on every television.</i>

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:22.206
<i>This message must resound</i>
<i>throughout the entire InterLink!</i>

01:30:22.384 --> 01:30:25.785
<i>I want this country to realize</i>
<i>that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

01:30:25.954 --> 01:30:30.220
<i>I want every man, woman and child</i>
<i>to understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

01:30:30.392 --> 01:30:32.326
<i>I want everyone...</i>

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:36.224
<i>... to remember why they need us!</i>

01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:40.926
<i>In the former United States, civil war</i>
<i>continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:45.402
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage</i>
<i>to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:48.701
<i>Ministry officials expect</i>
<i>water coupon prices to rise.</i>

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.844
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects...</i>

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:54.778
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:58.908
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new</i>
<i>airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:03.413
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence linking</i>
<i>the terrorist organization called V...</i>

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:07.894
<i>... to the St. Mary's viral attack</i>
<i>on London 14 years ago.</i>

01:31:19.908 --> 01:31:22.433
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.506
There were three men.

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.476
Covert intel.

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:28.912
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:33.785
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:36.048
The day after
the St. Mary's outbreak...

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:39.625
...Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:41.284
Rookwood goes missing.

01:31:41.463 --> 01:31:44.398
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

01:31:44.566 --> 01:31:46.329
Rookwood.

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.332
How do I know that name?

01:31:55.543 --> 01:31:58.535
Shit. He must have had a hidden trip
on his file at the Finger.

01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:00.977
But how'd he know it was you?

01:32:02.584 --> 01:32:04.108
What do we do?

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.118
I'm a cop. I have to know.

01:32:16.598 --> 01:32:19.931
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

01:32:21.603 --> 01:32:23.230
Still does.

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.472
That's close enough, inspector.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.279
We're not wired.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.812
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

01:32:42.991 --> 01:32:46.256
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:48.487
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:51.131
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.290
A story can be true or false.

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:56.994
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:01.275
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

01:33:01.443 --> 01:33:04.571
...with a young,
up-and-coming politician.

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:08.705
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:13.252
<i>He's completely single-minded</i>
<i>and has no regard for the political process.</i>

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:16.584
<i>The more power he attains,</i>
<i>the more obvious his zealotry...</i>

01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:19.352
<i>... and the more aggressive</i>
<i>his supporters become.</i>

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:25.358
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special</i>
<i>project in the name of national security.</i>

01:33:25.567 --> 01:33:28.934
<i>At first it's believed to be a search</i>
<i>for biological weapons...</i>

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:31.867
<i>... and it's pursued without regard</i>
<i>to its cost.</i>

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.771
<i>However, the true goal</i>
<i>of this project is power.</i>

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:38.708
<i>Complete and total</i>
<i>hegemonic domination.</i>

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.440
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:45.411
<i>But the efforts of those involved</i>
<i>are not in vain...</i>

01:33:45.587 --> 01:33:50.615
<i>... for a new ability to wage war is born</i>
<i>from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:54.387
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.588
...and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:02.668
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power,</i>
<i>how best to use such a weapon?</i>

01:34:02.871 --> 01:34:06.466
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:09.142
<i>A man seemingly</i>
<i>without a conscience...</i>

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.574
<i>... for whom the ends</i>
<i>always justify the means.</i>

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:15.341
<i>He suggests that their target</i>
<i>should not be an enemy of the country...</i>

01:34:15.517 --> 01:34:17.382
<i>... but rather, the country itself.</i>

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:20.785
<i>Three targets are chosen</i>
<i>to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.947
<i>A school, a tube station</i>
<i>and a water-treatment plant.</i>

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:26.719
<i>Several hundred die</i>
<i>within the first few weeks.</i>

01:34:26.895 --> 01:34:29.227
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:32.058
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:34.224
- Sent destruction
through the Underground.

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:38.264
<i>Fueled by the media,</i>
<i>fear and panic spread quickly...</i>

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:43.672
<i>... fracturing and dividing the country until,</i>
<i>at last, the true goal comes into view.</i>

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:45.278
Before the St. Mary's crises...

01:34:45.446 --> 01:34:49.644
...no one would have predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:54.277
<i>And then not long after the election,</i>
<i>lo and behold, a miracle.</i>

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:56.980
<i>Some believed it was the work</i>
<i>of God himself.</i>

01:34:57.158 --> 01:35:00.924
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company</i>
<i>controlled by certain party members...</i>

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:04.326
<i>... that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:08.662
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed...

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:12.135
...while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:17.941
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:20.444
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

01:35:20.615 --> 01:35:23.243
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:27.377
...to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:30.149
The rest, as they say, is history.

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:36.222
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.736
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:44.769
I'm sure you would.

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:49.842
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:52.980
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

01:35:53.147 --> 01:35:56.014
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

01:35:56.184 --> 01:35:57.651
...l'll contact you again.

01:35:57.819 --> 01:36:00.083
Till then, cheerio.

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:03.087
Rookwood...

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:06.590
...why didn't you come forward before?

01:36:07.662 --> 01:36:09.027
What were you waiting for?

01:36:09.197 --> 01:36:11.392
Well, for you, inspector.

01:36:11.566 --> 01:36:13.363
I needed you.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.721
What's he doing in the dark there?

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:45.422
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:49.195
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.531
And we both know why.

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:54.572
After I destroy Parliament...

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:58.644
...his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.041
And who will that be?

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:02.442
You, Mr. Creedy.

01:37:02.617 --> 01:37:06.109
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:10.087
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

01:37:10.258 --> 01:37:13.421
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:16.085
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

01:37:16.264 --> 01:37:19.062
...why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:21.793
...and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:26.406
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:29.566
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:33.739
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

01:37:33.915 --> 01:37:35.906
You knew that one day
it'd be you or him.

01:37:36.084 --> 01:37:39.417
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:42.750
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

01:37:42.924 --> 01:37:46.724
...men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

01:37:46.894 --> 01:37:49.795
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:54.795
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

01:37:56.938 --> 01:37:58.838
Why should I trust you?

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.203
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

01:38:10.118 --> 01:38:13.645
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,</i>
<i>but your past that disarmed you.</i>

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:16.855
<i>May we come up?</i>

01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:20.456
<i>You find your own tree.</i>

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:34.370
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:37.408
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:43.015
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:47.654
- Yeah.
<i>- Is that Chief Inspector Finch?</i>

01:38:47.822 --> 01:38:49.619
- It is.
<i>- This is Captain Clark...</i>

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:51.884
<i>... of the 137th Ward at Southend.</i>

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.287
<i>- We found him.</i>
- Found who?

01:38:53.461 --> 01:38:55.520
<i>William Rookwood,</i>
<i>the one you're looking for.</i>

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:59.496
<i>I saw your report a couple weeks back,</i>
<i>thought I'd run it through our John Does.</i>

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.567
<i>I hooked him. Perfect dental match.</i>

01:39:01.736 --> 01:39:05.672
<i>A floater. Fishermen picked him up.</i>
<i>No ID, never solved. Till now, that is.</i>

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.606
- William Rookwood is dead?
<i>- I'd say so. Twenty years now.</i>

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.341
Goddamn it!

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:17.013
That son of a bitch sat there...

01:39:17.185 --> 01:39:20.882
...and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:23.723
So, what do we do now, inspector?

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:26.257
We do what we should have been doing.

01:39:27.028 --> 01:39:28.359
We find him.

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.985
<i>Every day, gentlemen.</i>

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:57.181
<i>Every day that brings us closer</i>
<i>to November...</i>

01:39:57.358 --> 01:40:00.088
<i>... every day that man remains free...</i>

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:02.952
<i>... is one more failure.</i>

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:05.564
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven days,</i>
<i>gentlemen.</i>

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:08.133
<i>Three hundred and forty-seven failures!</i>

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:10.998
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:17.133
<i>We are being buried beneath the avalanche</i>
<i>of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy!</i>

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:35.857
I'll get it.

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:39.529
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:45.633
Bloody hell.

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:49.035
How many went out?

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:50.905
So far we count eight boxcars.

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:53.876
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:59.510
<i>I want anyone caught</i>
<i>with one of those masks arrested!</i>

01:40:59.687 --> 01:41:02.485
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

01:41:02.657 --> 01:41:05.649
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:08.794
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

01:41:08.963 --> 01:41:12.660
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:18.066
<i>Mr. Creedy, I am holding you</i>
<i>personally responsible for this situation.</i>

01:41:20.508 --> 01:41:24.911
<i>The problem is that he knows us</i>
<i>better than we know ourselves.</i>

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:29.810
That's why I went to Larkhill
last night.

01:41:29.984 --> 01:41:33.420
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:36.716
<i>There wasn't much left.</i>

01:41:37.692 --> 01:41:40.855
<i>But when I was there, it was strange.</i>

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:44.691
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

01:41:50.371 --> 01:41:51.998
Like I could see the whole thing.

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:57.209
<i>One long chain of events that stretched</i>
<i>all the way back before Larkhill.</i>

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:02.579
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

01:42:08.723 --> 01:42:10.691
...and everything that
was going to happen.

01:42:11.359 --> 01:42:12.883
Hey, you!

01:42:14.929 --> 01:42:19.229
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

01:42:20.568 --> 01:42:23.059
...and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

01:42:27.675 --> 01:42:29.472
...and all trapped by it.

01:42:36.851 --> 01:42:38.716
So do you know what's gonna happen?

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.580
No. It was a feeling.

01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:46.219
But I can guess.

01:42:48.195 --> 01:42:51.722
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

01:42:56.037 --> 01:42:57.595
And when they do...

01:42:57.772 --> 01:42:59.740
...things will turn nasty.

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:16.050
<i>Rioters were arrested in Brixton.</i>

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:20.694
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:29.200
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

01:43:30.471 --> 01:43:31.802
And then...

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:38.664
Tonight's your big night.

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:41.368
You ready for it?

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:45.771
Are we ready for it?

01:45:19.013 --> 01:45:20.640
I missed this song.

01:45:21.549 --> 01:45:23.608
I didn't think you'd come.

01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:26.118
I said I would.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:31.649
You look well.

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:33.258
Thank you.

01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:39.423
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.569
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

01:45:44.171 --> 01:45:48.107
I must confess, every time I heard a siren,
I worried about you.

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:51.608
I worried about myself for a while.

01:45:51.779 --> 01:45:54.543
But then, one day, I was at a market...

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:58.776
...and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

01:45:59.954 --> 01:46:04.118
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:07.758
My friend picked it up...

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:09.987
...and handed it to me.

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:13.064
She looked at me right in the eyes...

01:46:14.068 --> 01:46:15.933
...didn't recognize me.

01:46:18.272 --> 01:46:21.332
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:29.839
I have a gift for you, Evey...

01:46:30.017 --> 01:46:35.011
...but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:38.158
Would you dance with me?

01:46:39.193 --> 01:46:42.685
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:46.355
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.196
I'd love to.

01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:53.799
<i>Tonight, I will speak directly</i>
<i>to these people...</i>

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:56.408
<i>... and make the situation</i>
<i>perfectly clear to them.</i>

01:46:56.577 --> 01:47:02.140
<i>The security of this nation depends</i>
<i>on complete and total compliance.</i>

01:47:02.316 --> 01:47:06.844
<i>Tonight, any protestor,</i>
<i>any instigator or agitator...</i>

01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:09.751
<i>... will be made example of!</i>

01:47:12.026 --> 01:47:14.995
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.993
<i>And what is that, Mr. Dascomb?</i>

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:19.359
- Should the terrorist succeed...
<i>- He won't.</i>

01:47:19.533 --> 01:47:23.060
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

01:47:23.237 --> 01:47:27.003
<i>If he does, and something happens</i>
<i>to that building...</i>

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:30.439
<i>... the only thing that will change,</i>
<i>the only difference it will make...</i>

01:47:30.611 --> 01:47:33.341
<i>... is that tomorrow morning,</i>
<i>instead of a newspaper...</i>

01:47:33.514 --> 01:47:37.382
<i>... I will be reading</i>
<i>Mr. Creedy's resignation!</i>

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:46.352
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

01:47:46.527 --> 01:47:50.588
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.459
It's nearly time.

01:47:52.633 --> 01:47:55.295
The masks were ingenious.

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:58.302
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:01.566
Conceal me what I am,
and be my aid...

01:48:01.742 --> 01:48:05.109
...for such disguise as haply shall become
the form of my intent.

01:48:05.279 --> 01:48:08.146
<i>- Twelfth Night</i>.
- Viola.

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:11.045
- I don't understand.
- What?

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:14.619
How you can be one of the most important
things that has happened to me...

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:17.222
...and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

01:48:17.391 --> 01:48:20.189
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

01:48:20.361 --> 01:48:22.795
...if you had any brothers or sisters.

01:48:22.963 --> 01:48:26.091
I don't even know
what you really look like.

01:48:26.266 --> 01:48:28.291
Evey, please.

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:31.731
There is a face beneath this mask...

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.736
...but it's not me.

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:37.274
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:39.105
...or the bones beneath them.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.576
I understand.

01:48:43.784 --> 01:48:45.376
Thank you.

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.883
There isn't much time.

01:48:48.055 --> 01:48:50.250
I have something I must give you.

01:48:50.524 --> 01:48:52.583
I went by Parliament.

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.595
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:01.400
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.998
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

01:49:06.774 --> 01:49:09.334
What usually happens
when people without guns...

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:12.206
...stand up to people with guns.

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:14.504
Pull over here.

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:18.173
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:22.987
Inspector.

01:49:23.791 --> 01:49:25.656
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

01:49:34.468 --> 01:49:38.268
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

01:49:38.439 --> 01:49:39.667
They did.

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.640
It took nearly 10 years to clear the tracks
and lay a bit of my own.

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.136
Let me show you.

01:50:03.297 --> 01:50:05.162
These tracks lead to Parliament.

01:50:05.466 --> 01:50:06.865
Yes.

01:50:07.568 --> 01:50:09.559
Then it's really going to happen, isn't it?

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:13.035
It will if you want it to.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:15.667
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

01:50:16.243 --> 01:50:21.704
Everything that I have: My home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

01:50:21.882 --> 01:50:24.851
...l'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:26.417
Is this another trick, V?

01:50:26.587 --> 01:50:30.956
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:33.024
Only truth.

01:50:33.193 --> 01:50:36.356
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

01:50:36.864 --> 01:50:41.767
...that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

01:50:41.935 --> 01:50:44.733
- Why?
- Because this world...

01:50:44.905 --> 01:50:49.365
...the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.435
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

01:50:52.613 --> 01:50:57.710
...that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

01:51:00.721 --> 01:51:02.655
Where are you going?

01:51:02.890 --> 01:51:05.222
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:08.725
...and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

01:51:08.896 --> 01:51:11.660
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:14.392
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

01:51:14.568 --> 01:51:17.537
No. You were right about what I am.

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.962
I have no tree waiting for me.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.934
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

01:51:25.112 --> 01:51:26.875
That's not true.

01:51:53.473 --> 01:51:54.838
I can't.

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:05.545
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:08.110
<i>... tonight, our country...</i>

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:09.812
<i>... that which we stand for...</i>

01:52:10.023 --> 01:52:11.615
<i>... and all that we hold dear...</i>

01:52:11.792 --> 01:52:15.558
<i>... faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

01:52:15.729 --> 01:52:17.196
The area's clean, sir.

01:52:17.798 --> 01:52:21.564
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault</i>
<i>to our security...</i>

01:52:21.735 --> 01:52:23.498
<i>... will not go undefended.</i>

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:24.967
Where is he?

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:26.127
<i>Or unpunished.</i>

01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:28.467
Penny for the Guy.

01:52:28.642 --> 01:52:32.635
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one,</i>
<i>seeking to divide us...</i>

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:37.683
<i>... and destroy the very foundation</i>
<i>of our great nation.</i>

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:41.912
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

01:52:42.089 --> 01:52:43.249
Bring him down.

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:45.653
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:47.990
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:51.358
<i>But most of all,</i>
<i>we must remain united.</i>

01:52:54.635 --> 01:52:58.264
<i>Those caught tonight</i>
<i>in violation of curfew...</i>

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:01.066
<i>... will be considered in league</i>
<i>with our enemy...</i>

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:04.506
<i>... and prosecuted as a terrorist</i>
<i>without leniency or exception.</i>

01:53:04.678 --> 01:53:06.168
I want to see his face.

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:09.804
<i>Tonight I give you</i>
<i>my most solemn vow...</i>

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:12.383
<i>... that justice will be swift...</i>

01:53:12.552 --> 01:53:15.020
<i>... it will be righteous...</i>

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:17.452
<i>... and it will be without mercy.</i>

01:53:19.593 --> 01:53:21.788
Oh, God. No.

01:53:21.962 --> 01:53:25.864
At last, we finally meet.

01:53:28.402 --> 01:53:30.768
I have something for you, chancellor.

01:53:31.038 --> 01:53:32.835
A farewell gift.

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:36.601
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

01:53:36.777 --> 01:53:38.802
...and for the only thing you have left.

01:53:41.148 --> 01:53:43.082
Goodbye, chancellor.

01:53:44.084 --> 01:53:45.278
Mr. Creedy.

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:49.417
Disgusting.

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:04.329
Now that's done with...

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:08.338
...it's time to have a look at your face.

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:10.399
Take off your mask.

01:54:10.711 --> 01:54:11.939
No.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.987
Defiant to the end, huh?

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:34.559
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

01:54:34.735 --> 01:54:35.861
You're like me.

01:54:36.036 --> 01:54:40.473
The only thing you and I have in common,
Mr. Creedy, is we're both about to die.

01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:43.872
How do you imagine
that's gonna happen?

01:54:44.144 --> 01:54:46.339
With my hands around your neck.

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:49.741
Bollocks.

01:54:50.851 --> 01:54:53.081
What are you gonna do, huh?

01:54:53.253 --> 01:54:55.346
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

01:54:55.522 --> 01:54:59.925
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:01.651
We have guns.

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:05.093
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.392
...l'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:10.328
...you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:12.831
That's impossible!

01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:16.300
Kill him.

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:42.059
My turn.

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.935
Die! Die!

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:59.004
Why won't you die?!

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:01.311
Why won't you die?

01:57:03.183 --> 01:57:06.277
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

01:57:06.453 --> 01:57:09.251
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

01:57:10.624 --> 01:57:12.819
And ideas are bulletproof.

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:07.638
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:09.076
This is General Ackroyd.

01:58:09.516 --> 01:58:11.040
Keep communication tight.

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:14.482
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:19.722
V!

01:58:24.364 --> 01:58:26.889
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

01:58:27.067 --> 01:58:31.197
Please, don't. I'm finished and glad of it.

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:33.196
Don't say that.

01:58:33.707 --> 01:58:36.574
I told you, only truth.

01:58:40.113 --> 01:58:43.549
For 20 years I sought only this day.

01:58:43.717 --> 01:58:45.844
Nothing else existed...

01:58:47.921 --> 01:58:49.912
...until I saw you.

01:58:51.091 --> 01:58:53.355
Then everything changed.

01:58:54.761 --> 01:58:56.695
I fell in love with you, Evey...

01:58:58.264 --> 01:59:01.461
...like I no longer believed I could.

01:59:01.634 --> 01:59:04.102
V, I don't want you to die.

01:59:06.873 --> 01:59:10.639
That's the most beautiful thing...

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:13.404
...you could have ever given me.

01:59:20.954 --> 01:59:22.421
V?

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:24.918
V?!

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:38.337
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

01:59:38.505 --> 01:59:40.530
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

02:00:12.772 --> 02:00:14.865
Hold it. Stop right there.

02:00:18.278 --> 02:00:19.768
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:29.049
Then it's over?

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:30.750
Almost.

02:00:30.924 --> 02:00:33.358
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

02:00:35.728 --> 02:00:36.786
No.

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.963
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

02:00:40.133 --> 02:00:42.363
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:46.135
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

02:00:46.306 --> 02:00:47.603
Or from the high chancellor.

02:00:48.508 --> 02:00:49.736
Why are you doing this?

02:00:50.276 --> 02:00:52.642
- Because he was right.
- About what?

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:57.306
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

02:01:02.355 --> 02:01:04.846
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:34.051
Jesus bloody Christ.

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:00.437
It's time.

02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.131
Tell me...

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:26.661
...do you like music, Mr. Finch?

02:02:46.259 --> 02:02:48.250
That music?

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:50.194
Yes.

02:02:50.630 --> 02:02:52.188
His music.

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:25.688
Who was he?

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:28.194
He was Edmond Dantes.

02:03:30.370 --> 02:03:32.770
And he was my father...

02:03:32.939 --> 02:03:34.873
...and my mother.

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:37.208
My brother.

02:03:39.212 --> 02:03:41.077
My friend.

02:03:42.015 --> 02:03:44.006
He was you...

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:47.552
...and me.

02:03:49.656 --> 02:03:51.521
He was all of us.

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.420
<i>No one will ever forget that night...</i>

02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:26.251
<i>... and what it meant for this country.</i>

02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:29.193
<i>But I will never forget the man...</i>

02:04:29.362 --> 02:04:31.023
<i>... and what he meant to me.</i>

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.331
