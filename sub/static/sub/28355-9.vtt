00:05.743 --> 00:07.571
<i>You get inside people's heads,</i>

00:07.604 --> 00:09.640
make them feel pain so
it can take away yours?

00:09.673 --> 00:12.609
The headaches got so bad,
I decided to kill myself.

00:12.642 --> 00:14.377
<i>Then something happened that night.</i>

00:14.410 --> 00:16.030
<i>A rig explosion.</i>

00:16.056 --> 00:17.614
Just like that, the fates...

00:17.648 --> 00:19.555
<i>gave me a way to make
the headaches stop.</i>

00:19.580 --> 00:20.784
<i>These are our missing girls.</i>

00:20.809 --> 00:22.152
<i>You know what it took
to find those girls?</i>

00:22.177 --> 00:23.471
Look at what she did to this guy!

00:23.495 --> 00:24.496
And maybe he deserved it.

00:24.497 --> 00:25.870
The world might need someone like you

00:25.895 --> 00:26.957
more than it needs someone like me.

00:26.990 --> 00:29.727
- So what are you saying?
- You get to drive.

00:29.759 --> 00:31.661
Hey, Brigid did make it out, right?

00:31.695 --> 00:34.264
Sure. She's in here, too.

00:34.297 --> 00:37.001
They destroyed my boys
just for living their lives.

00:37.034 --> 00:38.538
I don't like you.

00:38.563 --> 00:41.105
Mrs. Johnson, do you
have something you want to confess?

00:41.138 --> 00:44.175
Andre taught me that
pain could give me power

00:44.208 --> 00:45.509
if I could see to it.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.312
You don't know shit, Lia.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.436
Vinyl, man? Really?

01:14.470 --> 01:16.805
You know, here in the future, there
are better ways to record a set.

01:16.839 --> 01:18.774
Nah, man, there ain't.

01:18.807 --> 01:20.409
You been to Icarus Records?

01:20.442 --> 01:22.897
Of course I've been there. I mean,
what's that got to do with anything?

01:22.922 --> 01:25.114
They got this bin in the jazz section.

01:25.146 --> 01:26.815
"The Greats" is what it's called.

01:26.849 --> 01:29.085
Got all them old cats in there.

01:29.117 --> 01:30.786
Duke, Miles, Lips.

01:30.819 --> 01:33.288
The legends. The gods.

01:33.322 --> 01:35.124
And after I hit that note tonight?

01:35.156 --> 01:37.926
This record right here...
it's gonna be in that bin.

01:37.959 --> 01:40.629
<i>Always nice to see
a local boy done good.</i>

01:40.662 --> 01:42.098
<i>Please welcome Andre Deschaine.</i>

01:42.131 --> 01:43.838
How's everybody doin' tonight?

01:43.863 --> 01:46.001
Come on, come on. Keep it
going, keep it going. Come on.

01:46.034 --> 01:48.503
Yeah!

01:48.536 --> 01:50.605
Yo, y'all ready to do this?
All right, cool.

02:03.918 --> 02:06.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:06.188 --> 02:08.491
Are you trying to hit
that blue note tonight?

02:08.523 --> 02:10.491
I ain't trying, I'm doing.

02:12.128 --> 02:14.330
<i>They said that if you do it right,</i>

02:14.362 --> 02:16.598
<i>if you climb that scale and build it up,</i>

02:16.631 --> 02:18.398
<i>it's like an out-of-body experience</i>

02:18.454 --> 02:19.826
<i>for you and the audience.</i>

02:19.897 --> 02:21.099
Andre, bro...

02:22.465 --> 02:24.635
maybe we should end the
song like we normally do.

02:24.667 --> 02:25.969
This is a big gig for us, you know.

02:26.003 --> 02:27.946
If we mess this up, they're
not gonna let us come back.

02:29.606 --> 02:31.742
<i>Everything's brought
me to this one moment.</i>

02:31.774 --> 02:33.810
<i>I'm ready to climb that mountain,</i>

02:33.844 --> 02:35.947
<i>live with the gods.</i>

02:35.980 --> 02:38.715
<i>Dre, I don't know if the
crowd out there is ready for this.</i>

02:38.749 --> 02:40.818
<i>Audience never knows what they want.</i>

02:40.850 --> 02:42.619
<i>We gotta show 'em.</i>

02:45.522 --> 02:47.567
<i>Make them ride the highs
and the lows with us</i>

02:47.592 --> 02:49.826
<i>until we all come out
the other side changed.</i>

02:52.796 --> 02:54.965
If you wanna be remembered as a god,

02:54.999 --> 02:56.868
you gotta start acting like a god.

03:26.107 --> 03:28.684
_

03:45.648 --> 03:48.051
<i>And then the crowds,
the fans, the audience...</i>

03:53.657 --> 03:56.226
<i>They in your thrall,
they're yours forever.</i>

04:01.165 --> 04:03.034
<i>That's the power of music.</i>

04:04.167 --> 04:05.869
<i>That's the blue note, baby.</i>

04:08.038 --> 04:09.506
<i>And there ain't nothing in this world</i>

04:09.540 --> 04:11.676
<i>more powerful than that.</i>

04:37.467 --> 04:40.438
- No dice?
- I can't track him this way.

04:40.471 --> 04:42.707
It worked before with
you and Connors, but...

04:43.907 --> 04:46.411
I think we're gonna have
to find Andre ourselves.

04:51.948 --> 04:53.750
Wanna talk about it?

04:56.219 --> 04:58.421
- Any of it?
- Ty...

04:58.455 --> 05:01.058
Come on. We have more important
things to do than talk.

05:02.426 --> 05:03.794
How are we gonna find Andre?

05:03.827 --> 05:05.665
Assuming he's not already out of town.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.098
Well, Evita said he
went to go see Auntie.

05:08.387 --> 05:10.774
Said he was looking for something.

05:10.801 --> 05:13.236
So if he didn't find it yet, he
should still be around, right?

05:13.270 --> 05:15.772
Okay, but that's not gonna help us.

05:15.806 --> 05:18.308
We don't have time to search
every block in New Orleans.

05:18.342 --> 05:19.943
Okay, maybe not, but...

05:23.279 --> 05:25.448
- What if...?
- What?

05:25.481 --> 05:28.152
Well, there's already people
out on every corner of the city.

05:28.185 --> 05:30.887
People who know those corners well.

05:30.921 --> 05:32.589
I got an idea.

05:33.789 --> 05:34.965
I'm gonna have to go alone,

05:34.990 --> 05:37.060
and I can't leave you alone right now.

05:37.094 --> 05:38.863
You do your thing, and I'll do mine.

05:39.962 --> 05:41.131
What are you gonna do when I'm gone?

05:42.265 --> 05:44.935
I can run down some leads of my own.

05:46.536 --> 05:48.724
See if I can find anything on Andre.

05:48.773 --> 05:49.917
You sure?

05:49.942 --> 05:52.343
Tyrone, if you ask me about
my feelings one more time,

05:52.375 --> 05:54.010
I'm seriously gonna kill you.

05:55.145 --> 05:57.647
We have to find him as
soon as humanly possible.

05:57.681 --> 06:00.369
And what are we gonna do if...

06:02.519 --> 06:03.855
when we find him?

06:05.789 --> 06:07.690
We'll cross that bridge

06:07.724 --> 06:09.937
whenever that bridge becomes a bridge.

06:11.861 --> 06:13.664
All right.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.666
All right, see you soon.

06:20.736 --> 06:23.006
<i>Hey, Mom, it's me.</i>

06:23.039 --> 06:26.977
Look, I know I was really
shitty to you, and I'm sorry.

06:28.478 --> 06:30.848
But some of the others
from group, they're...

06:32.916 --> 06:35.753
They're in trouble, and I...
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

06:36.919 --> 06:38.150
You don't have to call me back.

06:38.175 --> 06:40.178
Just send me a text and
let me know you're good.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.966
_

06:49.991 --> 06:51.160
Hey!

06:52.101 --> 06:53.570
I thought I told you stay out of this.

06:53.604 --> 06:54.705
You really think I'd listen?

06:54.738 --> 06:57.841
Look, we need to find
Andre and stop him.

06:57.873 --> 06:59.743
I can help. You know I can.

06:59.775 --> 07:01.011
You'll only slow me down.

07:02.044 --> 07:04.080
Brigid was a better liar.

07:04.113 --> 07:06.284
Yeah, well, that's about
all she was better at.

07:11.751 --> 07:13.790
Get in. A call came in. We have a lead.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.534
- What happened next?
- Found out the police

07:24.568 --> 07:26.870
pulled almost a dozen
girls from the Viking.

07:26.902 --> 07:28.705
A few were booked on previous warrants.

07:28.738 --> 07:30.073
The rest were released.

07:30.106 --> 07:32.075
- Anybody know anything?
- Well, that's the that.

07:32.108 --> 07:34.149
I tried to track them down
this morning for statements,

07:34.173 --> 07:36.512
- but they were gone.
- What do you mean gone?

07:36.546 --> 07:38.748
It's common for victims to
go back to their abusers.

07:38.782 --> 07:41.084
But for this many to disappear?

07:41.118 --> 07:42.719
There's something up about this one.

07:44.553 --> 07:46.522
Okay, what about the
ones that were arrested?

07:46.556 --> 07:47.925
That's the other that.

07:47.957 --> 07:49.926
They've all gone crazy or something.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.695
Like collective, Manson-girl,

07:51.728 --> 07:53.764
climb-the-bars-to-get-out type crazy.

07:53.796 --> 07:54.842
Get out to where?

07:54.866 --> 07:57.256
Yeah, well, that's the last that. Where.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.808
All we know is that
they started humming.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.137
First one, then two.

08:00.169 --> 08:01.871
And now they're all
humming the same few notes

08:01.904 --> 08:03.640
like some bizarre choir.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.782
Where's Andre?

08:11.815 --> 08:13.082
In the wind.

08:13.116 --> 08:14.552
The girls wouldn't talk about him,

08:14.577 --> 08:18.056
so there's nothing for
the NOPD, or us, to go on.

08:18.255 --> 08:20.625
So no one knows anything, and
no one's out looking for Andre?

08:21.957 --> 08:24.294
Not if this is about
who I think it's about.

08:42.869 --> 08:44.339
No purse, no wallet.

08:44.364 --> 08:46.450
Nice girl like that, I'm
sure somebody's missing her.

08:46.490 --> 08:49.192
No, no, no. You... you can't transport
that woman in an ambulance.

08:49.227 --> 08:51.262
- Ma'am, she has to go to the hospital...
- Detective O'Reilly.

08:51.287 --> 08:53.123
I'm with the Vice Task Force.

08:53.156 --> 08:54.758
That is Lia Dewan.

08:54.791 --> 08:57.920
She was abused by a
man who used private ambulances

08:57.967 --> 08:59.195
to transport his victims.

08:59.229 --> 09:00.931
Do you know how much
of a trigger it would be

09:00.964 --> 09:03.901
if she came to in an
ambulance with just you guys?

09:05.035 --> 09:06.637
She needs to come with us.

09:11.742 --> 09:13.477
Gotta admit, I did not see that coming.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.312
Me neither.

09:18.248 --> 09:20.316
- So what now?
- We wait for her to wake up,

09:20.349 --> 09:22.952
so she can tell us where Andre is.

09:22.985 --> 09:25.822
- And if she doesn't tell us?
- Same answer as when she does.

09:28.557 --> 09:29.826
Honestly?

09:29.859 --> 09:31.829
Would not have pegged you
for the murdering type.

09:32.896 --> 09:34.865
Honestly?

09:34.897 --> 09:36.399
Me neither.

09:44.956 --> 09:47.790
_

10:31.086 --> 10:32.499
Hello?

10:32.524 --> 10:34.169
<i>- Mom, it's me.</i>
- Tyrone?

10:34.194 --> 10:37.393
- <i>Are you all right? Is anything wrong?</i>
- No, Mom, I'm fine.

10:37.426 --> 10:39.662
<i>Well, where are you?
What number are you calling from?</i>

10:43.432 --> 10:44.601
It's a burner phone.

10:45.768 --> 10:47.470
<i>Are you in trouble?</i>

10:49.772 --> 10:52.330
<i>You need to be laying low,
Tyrone. People are looking.</i>

10:52.355 --> 10:54.900
Mom, stop. I'm fine.
I can take care of myself.

10:54.925 --> 10:56.879
<i>I know that you can,
Tyrone. I know that.</i>

10:56.912 --> 10:59.749
<i>It's not you I worry about.
It's everyone else.</i>

10:59.782 --> 11:01.284
I got you, Mom.

11:03.085 --> 11:04.587
How's Connors acting?

11:05.801 --> 11:07.023
<i>Connors?</i>

11:08.458 --> 11:10.461
Detective Connors.

11:10.493 --> 11:12.729
Yeah, he's... he's fine, um...

11:13.796 --> 11:15.432
He's filling in the blanks.

11:16.833 --> 11:17.802
It's, uh...

11:19.102 --> 11:20.637
We're getting there.

11:20.670 --> 11:21.872
<i>You sure?</i>

11:22.873 --> 11:24.842
<i>Of course I'm sure.</i>

11:24.874 --> 11:26.777
<i>He's not giving me any trouble.</i>

11:29.845 --> 11:30.980
Okay.

11:31.013 --> 11:32.315
<i>Just wanted to know.</i>

11:35.151 --> 11:36.786
<i>Keep an eye out for him, okay?</i>

11:40.482 --> 11:41.559
Of course.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.277
<i>I got you, too.</i>

11:54.170 --> 11:55.639
All right, I gotta go.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.040
I love you.

11:57.073 --> 11:58.843
Love you, too.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.897
- So, anything?
- No.

12:55.565 --> 12:56.733
There's just static.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.204
Like there's nothing
left of her in there.

13:07.777 --> 13:09.613
Hey, wait, wait. Hold up.

13:11.580 --> 13:12.916
Look, last time someone's hope was gone,

13:12.949 --> 13:14.718
Ty got in there and dug it out.

13:15.752 --> 13:18.354
Maybe we wait for him, we get the info,

13:18.387 --> 13:21.691
then you can do whatever your
dark heart wants with her, okay?

13:21.724 --> 13:23.726
There's still other girls in play.

13:26.629 --> 13:28.798
You're right. We need Ty.

13:44.814 --> 13:46.583
Solomon.

13:46.615 --> 13:48.117
What are you...

13:48.151 --> 13:49.886
Hey, I didn't do anything.

13:49.918 --> 13:53.024
- I'm not even on the corner or nothing...
- I know, I know.

13:54.690 --> 13:55.926
I'm just here to talk.

13:59.161 --> 14:00.564
Luke Cage, huh?

14:02.931 --> 14:04.368
I heard about him.

14:05.969 --> 14:07.104
I heard he's bulletproof.

14:08.171 --> 14:09.706
And looks just like...

14:11.007 --> 14:12.676
like us, you know?

14:12.709 --> 14:13.978
I do.

14:17.847 --> 14:19.516
Ain't seen this one before.

14:20.716 --> 14:21.951
What does that say?

14:22.719 --> 14:23.954
What, you can't read?

14:25.155 --> 14:26.357
No.

14:30.791 --> 14:35.329
"Luke Cage in Harlem
Rumble" by Karen Page.

14:39.636 --> 14:41.026
You should really
learn how to read, man.

14:41.051 --> 14:42.853
I don't need all that.

14:44.807 --> 14:46.142
You wanna be a hero like Luke Cage,

14:46.176 --> 14:47.744
you better develop those skills.

14:48.811 --> 14:50.013
I ain't a hero.

14:51.513 --> 14:53.983
Says who? You saved my mom's life.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.921
You know what I do day-to-day.

15:00.089 --> 15:01.791
You know what I like to think?

15:01.825 --> 15:03.317
I think even if he wasn't bulletproof,

15:03.342 --> 15:05.044
he'd still be in the mix.

15:06.396 --> 15:07.865
Trying to make things right.

15:08.897 --> 15:10.401
How about you?

15:11.901 --> 15:13.303
Yeah, I guess.

15:13.335 --> 15:14.537
Good.

15:16.906 --> 15:18.041
'Cause, uh...

15:19.676 --> 15:20.911
I need your help.

15:25.626 --> 15:28.070
I want you to tell Money Hustle
and Uptown Block I wanna meet.

15:28.102 --> 15:29.592
You do know they're
trying to kill you, right?

15:32.254 --> 15:34.056
That's why I wanna meet.

15:34.089 --> 15:36.892
They'll set up a time and a place,

15:36.926 --> 15:39.729
I'll show up, and they'll ambush me.

15:39.762 --> 15:41.397
It ain't that easy.

15:42.599 --> 15:44.401
Sometimes you can't fix things.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.865
Some things are just broke.

15:48.937 --> 15:50.319
Just because it's broke

15:50.344 --> 15:51.942
doesn't mean it needs to be fixed.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.549
Just tell them I wanna meet.

16:01.084 --> 16:02.585
I'll take care of the rest.

16:14.730 --> 16:21.399
_

17:15.696 --> 17:22.117
_

17:24.032 --> 17:26.023
Where am I?

17:26.068 --> 17:28.204
You're in Church of All Saints Hospital.

17:28.238 --> 17:30.806
You had an accident.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.209
You're gonna be fine,
which is miraculous

17:32.241 --> 17:33.475
considering your fall.

17:33.508 --> 17:35.277
Just a few broken ribs and just...

17:35.311 --> 17:36.880
Close those damn curtains.

17:36.912 --> 17:38.681
The light is killing me.

17:44.519 --> 17:45.855
Better?

17:47.656 --> 17:49.325
Does your head hurt?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.561
Your x-ray showed no
sign of injury to...

17:51.594 --> 17:53.330
Not from the accident.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.864
I get migraines.

17:54.898 --> 17:57.401
Well, that explains
the photo-sensitivity.

18:03.605 --> 18:05.909
There were people along
the river last night.

18:08.177 --> 18:09.713
They watched you jump.

18:10.947 --> 18:13.116
When you lose what you love...

18:14.883 --> 18:16.752
the whole world seems empty.

18:16.786 --> 18:18.321
You lost someone?

18:18.354 --> 18:20.023
The love of my life.

18:21.024 --> 18:22.659
My music.

18:22.691 --> 18:24.795
It was my whole world.

18:26.863 --> 18:29.865
Before I started
getting these migraines.

18:29.899 --> 18:31.767
Maybe I can help with that.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.037
I wish you could, but I doubt it.

18:35.071 --> 18:36.759
You never know.

18:36.784 --> 18:39.508
Perhaps you'll find
just what you need...

18:51.421 --> 18:52.788
Hello?

20:50.373 --> 20:52.241
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God.

20:52.275 --> 20:54.090
How'd it go? Did you find Andre?

20:54.115 --> 20:55.679
It's in the process.

20:57.046 --> 20:58.949
I talked to, uh...

21:01.550 --> 21:03.385
Whatever it takes to find him.

21:03.419 --> 21:04.621
So...

21:05.636 --> 21:07.056
Who did you talk to?

21:08.223 --> 21:10.859
- Which one is she?
- Both of them.

21:10.892 --> 21:13.395
If one Brigid is good,
then two is better.

21:13.429 --> 21:15.931
We need to find him, Ty.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.202
Is that Lia? Is she alive?

21:20.236 --> 21:22.405
Only kind of.

21:22.438 --> 21:24.741
Andre dumped her off
on the side of the road.

21:24.774 --> 21:27.377
- Does she know where she is?
- No.

21:27.410 --> 21:28.778
She won't wake up.

21:31.780 --> 21:33.249
Ty...

21:35.750 --> 21:36.952
There's a door.

21:37.786 --> 21:39.588
Of course there is.

21:41.889 --> 21:44.158
Tandy, I... I don't
think that's a good idea.

21:44.183 --> 21:45.961
I don't wanna go either, Ty, but...

21:47.662 --> 21:49.900
But what if this is the
best way to find him?

21:56.506 --> 21:57.908
You coming or not?

22:15.758 --> 22:16.793
What?

22:17.793 --> 22:19.662
What is this place?

22:20.764 --> 22:24.000
I think it's what happens to
the people that Andre drains.

22:25.968 --> 22:27.970
When all their hope is gone...

22:31.806 --> 22:33.509
this is what's left.

23:02.204 --> 23:04.339
If there's crazed killers in here...

23:04.373 --> 23:05.842
Then we'll deal with them.

23:06.741 --> 23:08.010
Like we do.

23:16.751 --> 23:18.787
You don't know what's out there.

23:18.821 --> 23:19.890
Where are we?

23:21.090 --> 23:23.560
I think we're...

23:23.593 --> 23:25.161
Ty...

23:25.193 --> 23:26.495
Look.

23:27.592 --> 23:30.396
It's an amazing offer,
but what about my job?

23:30.435 --> 23:32.004
You can come and stay with me.

23:33.543 --> 23:35.879
You don't need this place.

23:35.904 --> 23:37.339
You never even wanted to be a doctor.

23:37.373 --> 23:39.842
I know, but I just
can't do that to my dad.

23:39.874 --> 23:41.045
If your dad loves you,

23:41.091 --> 23:43.813
he wouldn't stop you
from pursuing your dreams.

23:43.845 --> 23:46.082
Medicine was never your dream.

23:48.883 --> 23:50.486
You care about me, don't you?

23:50.998 --> 23:52.764
Of course I do.

23:52.854 --> 23:55.258
Because I can give you back your music.

23:57.559 --> 23:59.562
Let me take care of you.

24:01.631 --> 24:02.865
Lia, I need you.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.969
- Look, we can go back.
- No.

24:08.304 --> 24:09.806
We have to keep going.

24:11.774 --> 24:13.243
But where do we go?

24:17.542 --> 24:18.677
Down.

24:58.354 --> 25:00.757
- Is that...?
- Lia.

25:00.789 --> 25:02.091
I don't get it.

25:03.354 --> 25:04.721
She looks so...

25:04.746 --> 25:06.615
- Hopeful.
- Normal.

25:15.537 --> 25:19.447
Wait, I think I know how to get to Lia.

25:19.511 --> 25:20.791
Tandy!

25:29.485 --> 25:31.688
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.522
I'm Tandy Bowen.

25:35.290 --> 25:37.192
I need to help out a friend.

25:38.861 --> 25:40.363
Is it okay if I borrow this?

25:40.395 --> 25:41.797
I promise I'll bring it back.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.334
If it'll help your friend.

26:36.017 --> 26:37.519
Tandy, what are we doing?

26:37.553 --> 26:40.390
Yes, Tandy, what are we doing?

26:50.732 --> 26:52.701
You can't hurt me here.

26:52.735 --> 26:53.836
We're in her mind.

26:53.869 --> 26:56.372
- Tandy, what do we do?
- Nothing.

26:56.404 --> 26:57.873
There's nothing you can do.

26:57.906 --> 27:00.075
Pretty soon there ain't
nothing that nobody can do.

27:00.109 --> 27:01.611
What do you want?

27:01.643 --> 27:02.911
An audience.

27:02.944 --> 27:05.948
One big enough that I can
draw enough of their despair...

27:07.383 --> 27:09.787
so I can hit a blue note.

27:09.812 --> 27:10.853
What's a blue note?

27:10.885 --> 27:13.489
It's what separates a man from a god.

27:14.989 --> 27:17.759
Tandy, you didn't tell me he was insane.

27:17.793 --> 27:20.796
No, I'm just willing
to do whatever it takes

27:20.829 --> 27:21.863
to live without pain.

27:21.896 --> 27:24.433
If that means becoming a god, so be it.

27:24.467 --> 27:26.768
Don't I deserve relief?

27:26.802 --> 27:29.138
I've been living with
these headaches for years.

27:29.171 --> 27:30.989
I don't deserve this pain
more than anyone else.

27:31.059 --> 27:32.242
Oh, but you do.

27:33.637 --> 27:36.711
You're sick and abusive.

27:36.745 --> 27:39.114
You trying to tell me that
you never took advantage?

27:39.148 --> 27:41.818
Not once used the gifts you've
been given for your own end?

27:41.851 --> 27:43.652
Because I know you have.

27:43.686 --> 27:45.438
You've only been dealing
with them for eight months.

27:45.463 --> 27:48.065
Let's see what you both
are like after eight years.

27:48.090 --> 27:49.792
Let's see how much you've been warped.

27:49.825 --> 27:51.760
I'm done being warped.

27:54.829 --> 27:56.331
Done being in pain.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.169
It's finally time to cash in.

28:03.171 --> 28:05.374
For others to share my burden.

28:10.565 --> 28:11.948
Well?

28:13.781 --> 28:15.551
Come on. What did you learn?

28:17.018 --> 28:19.188
That the whole city is
gonna end up like that

28:19.220 --> 28:20.856
if we don't find him.

28:29.566 --> 28:34.571
_

28:36.138 --> 28:37.674
Excuse me.

28:40.174 --> 28:43.345
I'm not sure if I'm in the right place.

28:43.379 --> 28:45.215
You're in exactly the right place.

28:47.082 --> 28:48.751
I'm Andre Deschaine.

28:50.219 --> 28:51.720
It's good to have you.

29:25.954 --> 29:28.190
Hello, ladies. Welcome.

29:29.758 --> 29:32.428
I know it's a hard time for everyone.

29:33.748 --> 29:36.691
But it's with an honest heart
that I say how glad that I am

29:36.745 --> 29:38.868
that each and every one of you is here.

29:40.144 --> 29:41.870
What'd they say?

29:41.903 --> 29:43.204
Kings too?

29:43.238 --> 29:44.774
Okay, where they gonna be at?

29:44.806 --> 29:46.441
Got it. Thanks, Solomon.

29:47.629 --> 29:48.710
Tandy...

29:49.877 --> 29:51.846
Tandy!

29:51.880 --> 29:53.783
I gotta go. Kings and Boys say it's on.

29:53.815 --> 29:55.517
This might be our best
bet at finding him.

29:55.550 --> 29:57.018
Wait.

29:57.052 --> 29:58.788
You have the gangs helping find Andre?

29:58.821 --> 30:00.290
I'm coming with you.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.927
Last time you met up with these guys,
you killed everybody in the room.

30:04.959 --> 30:07.229
- No chance.
- No, Tyrone...

30:17.773 --> 30:19.408
Where's this little bitch boy at?

30:19.440 --> 30:21.867
I got places to be...

30:30.853 --> 30:32.755
It wasn't their fault.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.824
They never stood a chance.

30:34.856 --> 30:36.825
And neither do you.

30:36.859 --> 30:39.228
Screw this. I'm not
waiting around any longer.

30:39.260 --> 30:41.612
Kill the girl and let's go.
We'll find Andre ourselves.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.937
I could have told you.

30:47.969 --> 30:49.972
It's harder than it looks.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.974
No!

31:00.949 --> 31:03.352
All right, you got my attention.

31:03.384 --> 31:05.555
- What you wanna talk about?
- Your survival.

31:07.789 --> 31:09.325
You can't kill her.

31:09.357 --> 31:11.493
An hour ago, you practically
begged me not to hurt her.

31:11.527 --> 31:13.129
An hour ago, she had something I wanted.

31:13.161 --> 31:14.796
She doesn't deserve to die.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.366
What happened to the Brigid
that believed in justice?

31:18.800 --> 31:20.869
Tandy...

31:20.902 --> 31:23.772
This is justice. She tried to sell you.

31:23.806 --> 31:25.807
She would have watched you get
raped without batting an eye.

31:25.841 --> 31:27.209
She is a victim too!

31:27.241 --> 31:30.178
Andre manipulated her.
He changed who she was.

31:30.211 --> 31:32.181
- Yeah, into a monster.
- You don't understand.

31:32.213 --> 31:33.649
No, you don't understand.

31:37.251 --> 31:38.520
Know who I am?

31:38.554 --> 31:39.822
Yeah, you's a bitch.

31:43.392 --> 31:46.228
You think you know so much.
You're so world-wise.

31:46.260 --> 31:48.897
People like Lia and Andre, like Connors.

31:48.931 --> 31:50.732
Yeah, they've had bad
shit happen to them.

31:50.766 --> 31:53.369
But that does not justify the
bad shit they do to others.

31:53.402 --> 31:54.903
- Period.
- It is not that simple.

31:54.937 --> 31:57.873
Yes, it is. Now move.

31:59.173 --> 32:00.542
No.

32:02.911 --> 32:04.747
I'm not gonna say it again.

32:04.779 --> 32:06.348
- Move!
- No.

32:08.182 --> 32:10.385
I'll ask you one more time.

32:10.419 --> 32:13.723
Do you know who I am?

32:15.891 --> 32:19.428
She deserves justice.
Not whatever this is. Ahh!

32:19.460 --> 32:20.695
Yeah.

32:20.729 --> 32:23.699
- We know who you are.
- Then you know what I can do,

32:23.731 --> 32:25.834
know what I've done, and
you know you can't stop me.

32:25.867 --> 32:28.369
You don't know what it's like.

32:28.402 --> 32:30.072
You think "that can't happen to me,"

32:30.104 --> 32:31.708
until you realize, it already has.

32:32.940 --> 32:34.375
Then you're as weak as she is.

32:34.409 --> 32:35.911
I brought you here
because this is the moment

32:35.943 --> 32:38.079
that you and your gangs
start following some rules.

32:38.113 --> 32:40.216
- You want a cut or something?
- No, I don't want no cut.

32:42.718 --> 32:43.952
I want a change.

32:43.986 --> 32:45.800
People are gonna find
drugs if they want them.

32:45.847 --> 32:47.722
Look, anybody buying
drugs for their own use,

32:47.756 --> 32:48.858
I can't stop that.

32:48.891 --> 32:50.359
I'm only one man.

32:50.392 --> 32:52.561
Anyone buying to force
onto someone caught up

32:52.594 --> 32:54.529
into something that
they don't want to be?

32:54.563 --> 32:56.364
They're off limits.

32:59.433 --> 33:03.772
Pimps, traffickers, anybody
that uses drugs to manipulate.

33:03.806 --> 33:06.374
I hear you. I really do.

33:06.408 --> 33:09.069
But that's a significant portion
of our business

33:09.094 --> 33:10.413
and we can't expect...

33:16.485 --> 33:18.120
This is not a negotiation.

33:18.152 --> 33:20.322
I don't care about your business.

33:20.354 --> 33:21.990
I don't care about how
much money you used to make.

33:22.024 --> 33:23.892
I don't care how much
it's gonna cost you.

33:23.925 --> 33:26.961
Things are going to change.

33:26.995 --> 33:30.332
I see. So you think you're
going to fix New Orleans?

33:30.364 --> 33:32.834
I'm done expecting anyone,

33:32.867 --> 33:35.270
you, me, this city,

33:35.304 --> 33:36.839
to be perfect.

33:38.306 --> 33:39.674
I'm still gonna fight for it.

33:41.509 --> 33:43.912
You get in my way,

33:43.946 --> 33:46.115
you don't follow my rules,
and I'll be fighting you.

33:53.121 --> 33:55.157
She's your responsibility.

33:55.190 --> 33:58.193
Whatever she does or
doesn't do, that's on you.

33:58.227 --> 34:00.129
No one else but you.

34:04.967 --> 34:06.869
Now, I need one more thing from you.

34:06.902 --> 34:09.304
I need the location
of one of your buyers.

34:11.572 --> 34:13.509
Ty, don't scare me like that.

34:14.877 --> 34:17.012
- Did you find him?
- I know where he is.

34:17.043 --> 34:19.214
One of their corner boys said
they heard him talking about

34:19.246 --> 34:21.216
returning to his old stomping grounds.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.853
- Club Delight.
- We gotta go. Quickly.

34:25.567 --> 34:28.471
<i>Patient Services, please call EDS.</i>

34:35.062 --> 34:37.065
That's what they said.

34:37.098 --> 34:40.034
One of their corner
boys said they saw Andre,

34:40.067 --> 34:41.770
recognized him and...

34:45.744 --> 34:46.947
Ready for this?

34:48.676 --> 34:50.745
I don't see any other options.

34:52.271 --> 34:53.804
Wait, wait.

34:55.917 --> 34:57.285
You know we have to...

34:59.187 --> 35:01.089
If what he said was true
and he can become a god...

35:01.122 --> 35:03.858
- We can't let that happen.
- I know.

35:03.892 --> 35:05.627
You know what that means, right?

35:06.816 --> 35:08.485
What we'll have to do?

35:09.469 --> 35:11.438
Not we.

35:11.502 --> 35:13.606
I'm the one with the knives of light.

35:13.631 --> 35:15.869
The burden's not on you, okay?

35:17.461 --> 35:19.196
If it comes to it...
if we have to kill him,

35:19.228 --> 35:20.596
we do it together.

35:21.545 --> 35:23.715
Just like everything else.

35:23.779 --> 35:27.994
Good and bad and in-between,

35:28.149 --> 35:29.885
we do it together.

35:31.752 --> 35:33.088
Okay.

35:34.291 --> 35:35.703
Together.

35:45.334 --> 35:46.569
You ready?

35:48.971 --> 35:50.506
Let's go.

36:02.417 --> 36:04.752
♪ Let's go way away ♪

36:04.785 --> 36:08.478
♪ New York, Paris, and
a girl to call your own ♪

36:08.548 --> 36:10.821
I think we're at the wrong place.

36:10.861 --> 36:12.594
♪ Yesterday... ♪

36:23.038 --> 36:25.140
<i>Those gang leaders played you.</i>

36:25.416 --> 36:28.343
- I don't think they played me.
- Of course they did.

36:29.611 --> 36:32.104
They played you, and now
there's nothing that we can do.

36:34.116 --> 36:35.384
What?

37:01.076 --> 37:03.879
Guess he was stomping somewhere else.

37:03.911 --> 37:06.848
The club... it burned down.

37:06.881 --> 37:08.316
Yeah.

37:09.492 --> 37:12.020
Which means this isn't
the original location.

37:12.053 --> 37:13.154
On it.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.736
What is this? Where is he?

37:29.604 --> 37:31.873
Wait.

37:59.768 --> 38:01.871
Tandy, what the hell is going on?

38:09.310 --> 38:10.711
Mikayla?

38:10.745 --> 38:13.114
Hey! Mikayla, can you hear me?

38:15.491 --> 38:17.252
Hey, come on, you have to leave.

38:18.419 --> 38:20.622
Uh... Tandy?

38:22.957 --> 38:24.258
Mom?

38:24.292 --> 38:25.828
Mom! Hey!

38:26.980 --> 38:29.931
Mom, come on, listen to me,
you have to get out of here.

38:36.702 --> 38:38.739
Tandy, we gotta do something!

38:42.910 --> 38:44.145
Tandy!

38:45.946 --> 38:47.782
Tandy, we won't reach him in time!

38:47.815 --> 38:49.384
Tandy!

38:49.417 --> 38:51.252
Tandy, throw a knife at me!

38:51.285 --> 38:52.887
Do it!

38:52.921 --> 38:54.189
Do it now!

39:05.598 --> 39:06.866
Ty!

39:19.773 --> 39:21.691
- Did everyone just...
- They all just disappeared!

39:21.726 --> 39:24.238
I mean, one second they
were here, and the next...

39:24.624 --> 39:26.293
Where'd they all go?

40:13.557 --> 40:16.705
<i>It's always nice
to see a local boy done good.</i>

40:16.738 --> 40:18.806
<i>Please welcome Andre Deschaine!</i>

40:24.078 --> 40:25.413
Tandy...

40:26.614 --> 40:27.950
Is that music?

40:28.850 --> 40:30.752
Well, where's it coming from?
