WEBVTT

00:08.290 --> 00:10.872
This is a special report
from La Plata County, Colorado.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.747
We're reminded of
Jim McKay's words from Munich,

00:13.750 --> 00:16.822
"Our greatest hopes and
our worst fears are seldom realized."

00:16.830 --> 00:18.070
Let's hope it's not the latter

00:18.080 --> 00:20.241
as we wait to hear
the fate of the women, children,

00:20.250 --> 00:22.241
and FBI agents inside the building.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.071
Jim, are you getting this?

00:32.790 --> 00:34.951
_ He comes _
Into my bedroom and lays With me.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.827
He says it's God's will. I'm only 15.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.742
And I'm not the only one.
Please help me.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.490
La Plata County
COLORADO

00:42.500 --> 00:43.990
Tell us about the 911 call.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.959
I believe the "he" that they refer to
is the church's leader, Benjamin Cyrus.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.246
Benjamin Cyrus. No criminal record.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.162
No record at all, really.
What else do you know about him?

00:53.170 --> 00:56.378
It's rumored that he's practicing
polygamy and forced marriages.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.870
Any idea who the caller is?

00:57.880 --> 01:01.702
Uh, Jessica Evanson is the one
who the age fits, but we can't be sure.

01:01.710 --> 01:05.077
So I negotiated interviews
with all the children. It wasn't easy.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.287
Well,
considering their view on outsiders,

01:07.290 --> 01:10.532
it would be best
if you didn't identify us as FBI.

01:10.540 --> 01:15.375
Just use our real names and introduce
us as Child Victim InterVIew experts.

01:41.290 --> 01:44.999
-I'm looking for Mr. Benjamin Cyrus.
-You found him.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.532
I'm Nancy Lunde. We spoke
on the phone regarding the allegation.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.782
"Savages they call us because
our manners differ from theirs."

01:56.210 --> 01:58.701
We didn't come here
to hear you ate scripture, Mr. Cyrus.

01:58.710 --> 02:01.076
Actually, it's Benjamin Franklin.

02:01.710 --> 02:04.952
Emily Prentiss, Spencer Reid.
They're child victim interview experts.

02:04.960 --> 02:10.034
How far from God's word must we
have strayed for there to be the need

02:10.040 --> 02:13.419
to invent a job called
"child victim interview expert."

02:14.460 --> 02:17.372
-We wish we didn't have to be here.
-So do we.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.029
But you are welcome nonetheless.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.747
The children are in the school,
as I indicated.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.069
Thank you.

02:25.290 --> 02:27.372
You're using solar power?

02:27.380 --> 02:30.918
Yeah, we're completely self-sufficient.
Electricity. Food. Water.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.286
Ben Franklin said, "God helps those
that helps themselves."

02:33.290 --> 02:37.408
-You looked surprised.
-No, impressed, actually.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.820
-Thank you.
-For what?

02:40.460 --> 02:41.666
For admitting that.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.958
We go to school, we do our chores

02:47.960 --> 02:52.078
and we treat ourselves and each other
with the respect God demands.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.412
But you've never been off of the ranch?

02:54.420 --> 02:56.411
I brought Jesse here when she was two.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.741
You've talked to
lots of children in your work.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.378
Tell me, are their lives
somehow better than ours?

03:01.380 --> 03:03.075
We devote ourselves to God.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.742
That doesn't mean
we're not devoted to our children.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.787
We are not_ here _
because of your religious beliefs.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.417
Why are you here?

03:10.420 --> 03:16.074
We received a phone call alleging that
an adult male member of your church

03:16.080 --> 03:19.959
was having inappropriate relations
with the younger women here.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.702
-You're talking about Cyrus.
-What makes you say that?

03:22.710 --> 03:24.996
-Jesse, come on... Shh.
-Is it inappropriate

03:25.000 --> 03:27.821
for a husband to share
a bed with his wife?

03:28.710 --> 03:30.871
You're married to Cyrus?

03:30.880 --> 03:34.031
Yes, Cyrus is my husband and a prophet.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.662
It's an honor to bear his children.

03:37.460 --> 03:40.167
Jessica, you're 15 years old.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.821
The state of Colorado
reqUIres parental consent.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.320
She gave consent.

03:45.330 --> 03:48.822
Get up. Get up. Come on, stand.
MAN 2: You heard him. Move.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.917
What's going on?

03:51.920 --> 03:55.708
We just got a very
strange phone call from a news reporter.

03:55.710 --> 03:59.328
Is there anything you want to tell me

04:03.040 --> 04:04.325
They don't know.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.282
Chapel, straight ahead.
School to the left.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.416
Team one, hit the school.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.739
Team two, hit the chapel.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.912
State police, we have a warrant!

04:38.380 --> 04:40.245
Clear!
OFFICER 5: Clear!

04:40.250 --> 04:42.992
Team one to team_two.
Be adVIsed, the school is empty.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.376
We have not secured the children.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.575
Hit it again! Hit it again!

04:50.880 --> 04:53.417
We have a hatch.
It's a tunnel.

04:57.540 --> 05:00.668
- What's going on?
-I don't know. Just stay calm.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.912
They knew we were coming. Out! Out!
Move out!

05:05.670 --> 05:06.705
Cover fire!

05:23.120 --> 05:26.578
All right, move quietly,
quickly go to the left.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.208
Everybody stay together.
Children, listen to your parents.

05:29.210 --> 05:31.952
All right, everyone, down to this end.
Have faith.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.109
Where did
all these guns come from?

05:33.120 --> 05:34.951
I don't know.
Garcia checked with the state police.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.246
Stay together. Remain calm.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.162
Everyone remain calm.
There is nothing to fear here.

05:40.170 --> 05:43.412
-This is ridiculous.
-It's okay. Just calm down.

05:43.420 --> 05:46.071
What's going on?
-They're trying to breach the front door.

05:47.250 --> 05:51.664
All right, remain calm, stay quiet.
God will protect you.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.781
We're pinned down.

06:04.380 --> 06:07.668
Cease fire. Cease fire!

06:08.000 --> 06:09.206
Get this door open!

06:10.620 --> 06:13.168
It's the state police.
I'm an officer of the state.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.956
Well, there's nothing we can do right now.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.417
-I can talk to him.
-No, you can't. It's dangerous.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.287
-Nancy. Stop. Nancy.
-Excuse me.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.952
Go away! We have women
and children in here! Please!

06:28.210 --> 06:32.112
Cease fire! Cease fire!

06:32.120 --> 06:34.497
Mr. Cyrus, let me talk to them.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.951
Do not fear,
we are on the side of the righteous.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.246
Where's Lunde?
-It wasn't us.

06:47.250 --> 06:51.573
What? You can't shoot it out
with the cops. You have children here.

06:51.580 --> 06:55.414
I didn't start this.
I'll take the roof, you take the tunnel.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.417
Check your rear. The hatch.

07:16.330 --> 07:17.706
Man down. Man down.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.740
We can't stay here.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.492
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

07:26.580 --> 07:30.664
We're giving you a chance to pull back.
Please take it.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.741
Bower's hit bad.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.451
Okay. We're pulling back.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.569
Pull back.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.570
They're pulling out,
they're pulling out.

07:51.580 --> 07:52.660
Not for long.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.878
"To follow by faith alone
is to follow blindly." Benjamin Franklin.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.495
B.A.U., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

08:35.500 --> 08:37.286
Morgan.
-What's up?

08:37.290 --> 08:38.416
What is reportedly being called

08:38.420 --> 08:41.571
a routine questions-and-answers
meeting by Colorado child services

08:41.580 --> 08:45.323
has turned into a violent and deadly
standoff between Colorado authorities

08:45.330 --> 08:48.072
and a fringe religious group
known as the Separatarian Sect.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.991
-The raid on the sect's compound...-JJ, that's not the ranch

08:50.000 --> 08:51.820
-where Prentiss and Reid are?
-They're still inside.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.206
Hotch!

08:53.210 --> 08:55.747
...Tactical Warrant Service Team
into a forced retreat

08:55.750 --> 08:57.456
after losing a 30-minute gun battle

08:57.460 --> 08:59.109
-with the heavily armed sect.-The TV! Prentiss and Reid.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.202
No one knows for sure
how many people are in5ide.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.667
It is believed at least three
of the child service members

09:03.670 --> 09:05.069
are still trapped within the compound.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.495
One police officer has died
and several others...

09:07.500 --> 09:10.708
All right, that means we're the lead with
Hostage Rescue in support. Let's go.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.575
It turned deadly when
the Colorado state police officers

09:14.580 --> 09:16.070
tried to serve a warrant.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.957
Colorado Attorney General Jim Wells says

09:17.960 --> 09:21.418
the reclusive cult has been the subject
of a six-month weapons investigation.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.490
Six months.
We didn't check?

09:23.500 --> 09:26.788
No, we checked.
I had ATF call Wells.

09:26.790 --> 09:29.327
He told ATF there were
no pending state investigations.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.957
-He lied.
-Why?

09:30.960 --> 09:34.168
Wells is challenging the Governor
in the next election.

09:34.170 --> 09:39.164
He thought that ATF was about to poach
his big election-launching weapons bust.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.536
Now it's clear he didn't know
there were FBI agents there.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.917
He just thought the best time
to serve a state warrant

09:43.920 --> 09:47.458
was when the kids were safe inside
the school being interviewed.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.950
What do we know about the sect?

09:48.960 --> 09:53.078
Liberty Ranch was founded
in 1980 by libertarian Leo Kane.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.957
He created it as a
self-sustaining commune.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.326
Libertarians believe that everyone has
the right to do what they want

09:57.330 --> 09:59.491
as long they aren't infringing
on the rights of others.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.240
But libertarians aren't religious.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.162
Clearly this sect abandoned
libertarian principles.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.819
Benjamin Cyrus, the current leader,

10:05.830 --> 10:08.037
introduced religion eight years ago
when Kane left.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.826
Garcia, what do we got on Cyrus?

10:09.830 --> 10:11.161
Oh, we got bubkes.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.912
It's like the guy never cast a shadow
on the known universe.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.569
However, his predecessor Leo Kane

10:15.580 --> 10:18.378
is doing a 17-year stretch
at Deerfield federal prison.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.610
Apparently libertarians
do not like paying taxes.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.326
17 years for tax evasion?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.207
Oh, no, that would be two years
for tax evasion

10:24.210 --> 10:28.283
and 15 for going after four IRS agents
with a Louisville Slugger.

10:28.290 --> 10:29.530
Let's have Kane brought to the scene.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.498
He's our best chance at finding out
some idea of who we're dealing with.

10:37.460 --> 10:41.032
Miles is dead. He was locking the door
when they shot him.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.168
Laura and Robert were asleep in their bed.
The bullets came through the wall.

10:44.170 --> 10:45.819
What about the baby?

10:45.830 --> 10:47.878
I have her.
She was at the school.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.282
Hello, darling.
It's all going to be all right, honey.

10:52.290 --> 10:57.114
Mommy and Daddy have gone to God,
okay? It's all going to be all right.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.953
-Take her to the temple and pray.
-Okay.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.615
Distribute weapons and ammo.

11:04.620 --> 11:09.114
I prayed this day would never come,
but it has. God will see us through.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.200
Yeah.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.243
Dave, they've left the choice
of negotiators up to me.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.571
I taught most of
the hostage negotiation unit.

11:35.580 --> 11:36.956
You want a recommendation?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.918
-I'm making you the lead negotiator.
-Me?

11:39.920 --> 11:42.536
Why go to the students
when I have the teacher?

11:42.540 --> 11:46.078
Because the teacher is emotionally
involved. So is the agent in command.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.321
I know I am.
This is a unique situation.

11:48.330 --> 11:51.163
We have two agents who could affect
the outcome on the inside.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.877
True, but I can't be objective.
I know them too well.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.529
This outcome depends as much

11:55.540 --> 11:59.078
on our ability to predict the moves
of Prentiss and Reid as Cyrus.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.036
That's why
you're the best man for the job.

12:01.040 --> 12:04.168
Assuming that Reid and Prentiss are
still in a condition to make moves.

12:04.170 --> 12:07.207
I know how bad this is.
That's why I want you doing the talking.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.246
All right.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.535
You're obviously not in charge,

12:11.540 --> 12:12.950
-I can see that.
-I'm sorry, Sir,

12:12.960 --> 12:14.951
I'm under direct orders from the FBI.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.951
I'm the Attorney General of this state.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.030
I demand to know
why I wasn't told that the FBI

12:19.040 --> 12:21.326
was sending undercover agents
into the Separatarian ranch.

12:21.330 --> 12:24.379
The only thing that you're in
a position to demand is a lawyer.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.031
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Aaron Hotchner, Unit Chief.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.577
I'm the guy who's going to tell the
Attorney General of the United States

12:29.580 --> 12:31.992
whether to charge you
with obstructing a federal investigation

12:32.000 --> 12:33.740
or negligent homicide.

12:33.750 --> 12:37.322
-You can't talk to_ me like that.
-Get off my crime scene.

12:45.540 --> 12:48.202
-Hey, Dan. You know Dave Rossi?
-Sure.

12:48.210 --> 12:49.666
We've been here before, haven't we?

12:49.670 --> 12:52.662
Waco. Ruby Ridge. Freemen standoff.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.706
Let's hope someone
listens to you guys this time.

12:54.710 --> 12:56.996
Oh, they did more than listen.
They put us in charge.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.615
So bring us up to speed.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.497
I've sent the state police packing.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.822
They started this mess, lost a man
in the process. I hope that's okay?

13:03.830 --> 13:06.321
-If you hadn't, we would have.
-Good.

13:06.330 --> 13:08.161
The county sheriffs have had
no run-ins with the sect,

13:08.170 --> 13:11.879
so we're using them as support.
We've had no contact with them so far.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.826
They've got power. Solar. We can
shoot out the panels if you think...

13:14.830 --> 13:16.707
No, no. That's an escalation.

13:16.710 --> 13:19.417
Okay. But that means
they have access to the news.

13:19.420 --> 13:23.163
I'll get JJ to talk to the press.
Are your men ready to be briefed?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.569
Okay, let's go.

13:24.580 --> 13:27.162
We call this the Minimal Loss scenario.

13:27.170 --> 13:32.745
Every person we get out is a life saved.
We won't save them all.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.242
All of us have to be prepared
to accept that situation.

13:38.210 --> 13:42.613
Cults are structured like pyramids.
You got the leader at the top.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.372
Diehard believers beneath.

13:45.380 --> 13:49.783
The biggest group,
the base, the followers.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.912
Women and children.
These are the people we can save.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.378
The Trickle, Flow, Gush strategy is
designed to get base followers out.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.871
At first one or two, then three or four,

14:01.880 --> 14:03.871
then as many as we can,
as fast as we can.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.247
And if at any point
it starts to go bad, we go in.

14:07.250 --> 14:10.378
The leaders are charismatic sociopaths

14:10.380 --> 14:13.827
who target those most susceptible
to their seduction.

14:13.830 --> 14:17.573
They have the ability to see
what each person needs

14:17.580 --> 14:21.209
and then they become that thing.
We have to undermine their perception

14:21.210 --> 14:24.782
that we're an invading army
laying siege to their home.

14:24.790 --> 14:27.418
We'll lose the fatigues.
Rancher's clothes work for you?

14:27.420 --> 14:29.206
Like we did at the Freemen standoff?

14:29.210 --> 14:33.328
Perfect. Anything we can do
to demilitarize this situation.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.166
Hello?

14:36.170 --> 14:37.706
You killed my mommy and daddy.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.703
-Are you going to kill me, too?-No one is going to kill you, honey.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.281
This is Benjamin Cyrus,
who am I talking to?

14:44.290 --> 14:47.828
David Rossi. I'm an FBI agent.
We've sent the state police away.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.741
There's just us and the local sheriff.

14:49.750 --> 14:53.709
All we want to do is resolve this
before anyone else gets hurt.

14:53.710 --> 14:57.077
-Then leave us alone.-I'm afraid we can't do that, Benjamin.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.571
One of the police bled out
on the way to the hospital.

14:59.580 --> 15:02.538
So let's just stop this
before things gets worse.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.748
Please just put down your guns
and come out.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.036
We're believers, Dave.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.611
We believe that God says what
he means and means what he says.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.453
His laws don't depend on
what state you live in.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.280
I have no issue with your beliefs.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.372
You don't, but the state does.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.325
I can't answer for other people.

15:19.330 --> 15:22.879
God will answer for everyone
in the final battle I've foreseen.

15:23.380 --> 15:27.419
That's why I'm here, to make sure
that this is not that battle.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.115
We shall see.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.419
Now the three child services workers...

15:32.420 --> 15:34.911
One of them is dead. It wasn't us.

15:37.380 --> 15:41.373
-I need a name. To inform the family.
-Her name was Nancy Lunde.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.493
Okay. Now, please, Benjamin,
send out your wounded.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.707
I promise you
they'll be well taken care of.

15:49.290 --> 15:51.667
With enough supplies,
we can tend to our own.

15:51.670 --> 15:54.321
Okay. I need a few hours
to put it together.

15:54.330 --> 15:57.322
I'll bring them up myself at first light.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.996
He could take you hostage.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.662
I'm going to confirm the kids,
Prentiss and Reid are okay.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.456
Rossi, at least let me go with you.

16:06.460 --> 16:09.702
No. This is about building trust.
I go alone.

16:09.710 --> 16:12.747
I want the parabolic arc mikes fixed
on every window in that structure.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.116
They won't pick up much.
They have blinds on all the windows.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.246
Unless they're shouting,

16:16.250 --> 16:18.286
the glass won't vibrate enough
for us to get an audio.

16:18.290 --> 16:20.827
Well, if they're not shouting,
these bugs will pick them up.

16:20.830 --> 16:23.572
At least until the batteries die.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.071
How familiar are Agents Prentiss
and Reid with our playbook?

16:26.080 --> 16:28.162
The BAU wrote the CIRG handbook.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.320
They'll know that we're trying
to get ears in there at all times.

16:30.330 --> 16:32.662
Good. Let's hope
they can get these people talking.

16:32.670 --> 16:33.876
They will.

17:17.420 --> 17:20.878
Dave? I'm Ben. Come on in.

17:43.960 --> 17:48.169
The children and our guests.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.320
I'd hoped you'd let me take the children.

17:53.330 --> 17:56.959
No, they're our protection.
I remember Waco. We all do.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.492
-This isn't Waco.
-They stay for now,

18:03.170 --> 18:07.322
while I pray for God's guidance.
Please don't try to force us out.

18:08.290 --> 18:10.747
No one's going to try to force you
out of here. Trust me.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.708
-Trust is _earned.
-It is.

18:17.210 --> 18:21.613
Tell them I'm not crazy. Tell them
I'm just a man living by God's law.

18:21.620 --> 18:22.826
I will.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.575
Prepare the wine.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.993
We are celebrating.
Everyone drinks.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.410
Everyone rejoices,

18:42.420 --> 18:46.379
because today we are one day closer
to being with Him.

18:49.330 --> 18:52.914
Look at Jessica's body language.
The way she looks at him.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.412
She literally worships him.
There's no way she made that 911 call.

18:58.620 --> 19:05.207
"Trust in God with all your heart.
Lean not on your own understandings."

19:06.380 --> 19:07.950
Trust in mine.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.077
Look at how she comes
between Cyrus and her daughter.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.571
She's inserted herself between them.

19:13.580 --> 19:17.459
"Acknowledge Him in all things
and He will guide your way."

19:17.460 --> 19:20.952
Drink to acknowledge Him
and I will guide our way.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.287
Reid and Prentiss are okay.
MORGAN: What about Cyrus?

19:32.290 --> 19:36.169
He's too calm. It's like he was
waiting for this to happen

19:36.170 --> 19:38.286
and now that it has, he feels vindicated.

19:38.290 --> 19:40.872
I got a signal.
I'm getting a signal here.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.871
We will be with Him soon.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.031
We have drank the poison together.

19:58.620 --> 20:04.160
Mothers, fathers, children,

20:04.170 --> 20:08.709
"though we walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, we fear no evil,

20:09.120 --> 20:11.111
"for Thou are with us."

20:11.120 --> 20:15.375
This doesn't fit. I looked him in the eye.
He was calm, lucid.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.666
-They're committing mass suicide.
-We don't know that for sure.

20:17.670 --> 20:19.570
-Rossi, he just said it.
-We're ready to go.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.207
If we go in there,
people are going to die.

20:21.210 --> 20:22.325
People are already dying.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.457
"And God will wipe the tears
from their eyes,

20:24.460 --> 20:29.955
"and there will be no more death,
nor sorrow, nor crying,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.741
"and there will be no more pain,

20:32.750 --> 20:35.958
"for all of the former things
have passed away."

20:35.960 --> 20:38.110
-What do we do?
-Nothing.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.532
We have to do something.
These people just took poison.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.872
No, Cyrus just told them they did.
I think he's bluffing.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.074
Why do you think that?

20:44.080 --> 20:47.914
Just after he told them about the poison
he waited for them to start to react,

20:47.920 --> 20:50.741
then he nodded to Cole,
and he started writing.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.322
Look, they're scanning the audience
looking for reactions.

20:54.330 --> 20:56.821
They're writing down
the names of the people who are crying.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.320
It's a loyalty list.

20:58.330 --> 21:00.821
So he knows who will follow him
to the end.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.616
Jim Jones pulled the same stunt.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.669
They did a test run just like this
years before they did the real thing.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.786
Prepare your men to go in.

21:07.790 --> 21:10.452
Be still. There was no poison.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.951
-Dan.
-Instead, a test of faith

21:12.960 --> 21:15.326
"because your adversary the devil

21:15.330 --> 21:21.109
"walketh about as a roaring lion
choosing whom he may devour."

21:24.540 --> 21:28.032
Watch each other for signs of weakness.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.110
You are your brother's keeper.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.492
-Tell them to stand down.
-Yes, sir. Nice call.

21:38.830 --> 21:41.412
-Former sect leader's here.
-I got it.

21:43.880 --> 21:48.203
Charles Mulgrew is his real name.
Charles Mulgrew.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.782
His mother was five months pregnant
when she showed up at our doorstep.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.952
He turned out to be one of the_ smart ones.
Ama2ing memory that kid had.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.952
Anything he read,
he could repeat back to you and he did.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.609
A mouthy little son of a bitch.

22:01.710 --> 22:03.325
Why'd he leave the ranch?

22:03.330 --> 22:06.663
When he was 17,
a couple of our young girls came to me

22:06.670 --> 22:09.377
and said that he'd been
messing with them.

22:09.710 --> 22:11.109
You mean sexually?

22:11.120 --> 22:15.284
Yes, sir, I do. Now don't get me wrong.
I'm a libertarian,

22:16.750 --> 22:20.572
but those little girls were too young
for a 17-year-old to be messing with.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.826
So you kicked him out for that?

22:22.830 --> 22:26.243
Yes, sir, I did.
His mother took him to Kentucky.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.667
Hadn't heard anything from him
for years

22:28.670 --> 22:29.910
and then
when he finally showed up again,

22:29.920 --> 22:31.785
he said his mother had died,

22:31.790 --> 22:34.076
he found God
and he wanted to come home.

22:34.580 --> 22:37.572
How does a kid like that get rid of you?

22:37.580 --> 22:40.879
One day he came to me and said God
told him that I should leave the ranch.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.417
I said if God felt that way,
God can tell me himself.

22:43.420 --> 22:47.117
He put a gun to my head and said,
"He just did."

22:50.960 --> 22:53.372
It took me 20 years to build that ranch.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.200
I'll do anything I can

22:55.210 --> 22:59.078
to help you send that ungrateful
son of a bitch straight to hell.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.785
I need a map.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.997
Charles Mulgrew.
Convicted in Kentucky at the age of 18.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.456
Three counts statutory rape.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.746
-So we need to talk to the warden.-Way ahead of you, honey.

23:09.750 --> 23:12.878
Mr. Kentucky Warden said that
once inside, Mulgrew found religion,

23:12.880 --> 23:14.370
became a model citizen.

23:14.380 --> 23:15.529
Well, it's not that hard to behave

23:15.540 --> 23:17.371
when you're in protective custody
the whole time.

23:17.380 --> 23:19.826
General population's a rough place
for a child molester.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.617
No, no, I don't think you guys understand.
He was a model citizen.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.918
This guy volunteered at the
prison hospital. The AIDS ward.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.706
He was reading to prisoners dying of HIV.

23:26.710 --> 23:28.575
-Good stuff.
-Damn straight.

23:28.580 --> 23:29.956
Now get our friends back, baby.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.996
Well, this makes things worse.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.072
-What -That he's been to prison.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.741
He knows what happens
to child molesters there.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.036
If the current sexual allegations
are true,

23:40.040 --> 23:42.998
and he thinks we know it,
he's not coming out of there.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.412
Then we have to make him think
he's not going back.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.570
JJ, I need you to release
a press statement

23:47.580 --> 23:51.459
saying that we have absolutely
no evidence of sexual allegations.

23:51.460 --> 23:52.996
You need to see this.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.490
Now well into its second day,

23:54.500 --> 23:56.240
the standoff
at the Separatarian Sect ranch

23:56.250 --> 23:58.491
has now been taken over by the FBI.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.912
There was much speculation
in regard to hostages.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.377
But anonymous sources inside
the State Attorney General's ofﬁce

24:03.380 --> 24:06.452
have told us there is
an undercover FBI agent

24:06.460 --> 24:09.452
currently being held inside
the Separatarian Sect ranch.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.280
Hostage negotiators say
they are making headway

24:11.290 --> 24:13.997
with the sect's leadership
and are hopeful for a positive outcome.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.165
There is still no word as to why

24:16.170 --> 24:18.411
an undercover FBI agent
was sent in alone.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.075
Which one of you is it?

24:31.290 --> 24:33.702
Which one of you is the FBI agent?

24:35.040 --> 24:37.281
Why do you think one of us
is an FBI agent?

24:39.830 --> 24:42.037
God will forgive me for what I must do.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.609
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:46.620 --> 24:49.532
One of you does. Who is it?

24:49.540 --> 24:53.169
Me. It's me.

25:16.750 --> 25:20.538
I told you not to put me in this position.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.530
We've got to go in.
ROSSI: We'd be risking the lives

25:28.540 --> 25:29.700
of everyone in there.

25:29.710 --> 25:30.916
Get up!

25:34.500 --> 25:38.994
3O tells us,
"Blows and wounds cleanse away evil."

25:44.000 --> 25:46.457
-I can take it.
-Oh, you can take it?

25:48.620 --> 25:50.781
Wait, wait. Listen.
Listen to what she's saying.

25:52.170 --> 25:53.535
I can take it.

25:53.540 --> 25:55.826
-She's antagonizing him.
-She's not talking to him.

25:55.830 --> 25:58.321
She's talking to us.
She's telling us not to come in.

25:58.330 --> 26:00.378
Pride comes before the fall.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.957
Tie her up. Put her upstairs.

26:21.540 --> 26:25.249
You should have told Cyrus who you were.
He's a prophet.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.538
He predicted Satan's armies
would come and lay siege to us.

26:28.540 --> 26:31.998
There's a name for that kind of prophecy.
Self-fulfilling.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.163
You don't know how dangerous it is
to lie to him.

26:37.750 --> 26:43.165
I know _it would _take a brave woman
to defy him knowmg the consequences.

26:43.750 --> 26:47.914
And that that woman would have to
have a damn good reason to do it.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.491
Did you know she was FBI?

27:09.580 --> 27:12.708
Nancy told me the woman was a child
abuse interview expert from Denver

27:12.710 --> 27:16.828
and the four years I'd worked with her,
Nancy'd never lied to me before.

27:18.080 --> 27:24.110
As far as you know. Their law says
that a 15-year-old girl is a child.

27:24.120 --> 27:28.784
50 years ago that same law said
a 14-year-old was an adult.

27:29.750 --> 27:32.207
Have children changed so much in 50 years?

27:32.210 --> 27:33.666
I can't tell you the number of times

27:33.670 --> 27:37.492
I've investigated abuse charges
against small religious groups.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.377
Almost all of them turn out to be false.

27:39.380 --> 27:42.417
-What do you think of that?
-It doesn't really matter what I think.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.570
-It does to me.
-Why?

27:44.920 --> 27:46.660
Because God wants to save you.

27:46.670 --> 27:50.071
I mean that's why he sent you here.
That's the reason.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.708
On the next call you should test them.

27:56.710 --> 27:59.873
Test the negotiator.
Make him prove that he isn't a liar.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.418
How would you suggest I do that?

28:03.420 --> 28:07.538
-Ask for the identity of the FBI agent.
-No, we already know her identity.

28:07.540 --> 28:08.666
They don't know that.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.035
Yeah,
but the FBI would never tell us.

28:10.670 --> 28:12.786
They keep on asking you
to release people.

28:12.790 --> 28:15.532
Tell them you'll release a kid
and you won't harm the agent.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.952
And if they really care about
the children, they'll have to tell you.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.951
You're trying to get us
to release a child.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.075
It's one kid.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.320
If they don't hold up
on their end of the deal,

28:22.330 --> 28:24.116
you'll know they can't be trusted.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.032
He has a point.
ROSSI: Reid has him.

28:27.420 --> 28:29.160
What is it, Christopher?

28:29.580 --> 28:33.619
Some have been talking about leaving.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.280
-Leaving?
-Yeah.

28:40.750 --> 28:44.538
Wake the baby. Let's let them meet
the orphan that they've made.

28:55.420 --> 28:56.876
How are you doing today, Ben?

28:56.880 --> 29:01.453
I will release a child if you tell me
the identity of the FBI agent.

29:01.460 --> 29:04.748
I promise no harm will come to them
from this point forward.

29:04.750 --> 29:06.786
I can't give you that information.

29:06.790 --> 29:08.781
I will send the child now.

29:35.880 --> 29:41.489
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
Come to me, sweetie. You're safe now.

29:41.830 --> 29:43.570
We got her, Hotch.

29:45.250 --> 29:49.459
I'm taking a big risk here, Ben.
-Trust is earned.

29:50.210 --> 29:52.166
Her name is Emily Prentiss.

29:52.170 --> 29:55.879
She came in with two child service
workers to talk to the girls.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.162
There's a good chance
we can work this out, Dave.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.741
I'm going to provide
another sign of good faith.

30:02.170 --> 30:03.876
You're doing a good thing here.

30:06.210 --> 30:10.249
Assemble everyone in the chapel.
Get Agent Prentiss down here.

30:12.880 --> 30:16.168
It's come to my attention
that some of our brothers and sisters

30:16.170 --> 30:19.992
have lost their faith in God.
That they no longer love us.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.956
They want to abandon us.

30:22.290 --> 30:25.111
So when I call out your name,
please stand.

30:25.500 --> 30:29.573
Todd Sutters, Melanie Sutters.

30:29.580 --> 30:33.619
- He looks pissed.
-Nathan Sutters, Evan Radley.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.918
-It's not as bad as it looks.
-Janelle Radley.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.209
-I'm so sorry.
-Josh Horton, Shawn Edmonds,

30:40.210 --> 30:43.702
-Sherry Gelman, Alice Danfield.
-Look at who he's releasing.

30:43.710 --> 30:44.995
Wyatt Rayborn.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.319
It's the ones who failed the loyalty test.

30:46.330 --> 30:49.288
Irwin Adell, Doris Beasley.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.245
I'll get word to the team.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.538
Wait for a sign from outside to indicate
what time the raid will come.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.825
Willis Farwell.

30:59.830 --> 31:01.991
I told her she shouldn't have
lied to you like that.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.571
To either of us. Take her back.

31:07.750 --> 31:10.071
Those of you that are standing,
please collect your belongings

31:10.080 --> 31:13.117
and report
to the front hallway immediately.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.957
We will surrender tomorrow at noon.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.531
I want the press there to ensure
that we're treated fairly.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.952
00 am. call.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.996
I'll see you then, Dave.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.206
I look forward to it.

31:38.210 --> 31:41.202
Oh, and one more thing.
Could you send some food in?

31:41.210 --> 31:42.666
Sure. What would you like?

31:42.670 --> 31:45.878
-Fried chicken. All the fixings.
-You got it.

31:47.620 --> 31:50.669
I don't understand.
Why did you let them go?

31:50.960 --> 31:52.609
They weren't prepared to do
what needs to be done.

31:52.620 --> 31:55.783
You're not_ one of us. You don't know
what it takes to be prepared.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.577
Listen to him. Tell him.

31:58.580 --> 32:01.708
They failed the test.
They had a chance to prove their faith

32:01.710 --> 32:04.577
when Cyrus told them that they'd
sacrificed themselves for God.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.741
But instead they showed
they weren't worthy.

32:07.210 --> 32:08.950
That's why he wants the media

32:08.960 --> 32:11.667
to bear witness _ _
to your true final act of sacrifice.

32:11.670 --> 32:12.910
How do you know that?

32:12.920 --> 32:15.457
I'm always looking for signs
of things to come.

32:15.460 --> 32:18.577
Reid's talking to us.
He wants a sign when we're coming in.

32:18.580 --> 32:22.744
He's telling us this is it.
Time has run out. We've got to go in.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.661
Drugging the food's
not an option because of the children.

32:29.670 --> 32:30.819
We have to go in.

32:30.830 --> 32:33.378
Best time to hit them is when
they're least mentally prepared.

32:33.380 --> 32:36.531
00 am.
Biorhythms are at their low point then.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.532
We need a diversion. Something
that plays into his expectations.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.246
-Cyrus brought up Waco.
-Right.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.822
I know exactly how to use that.
We need some Humvees.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.320
The plan depends on Reid and Prentiss

32:46.330 --> 32:47.957
separating the diehards
from the followers.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.781
And delaying Cyrus's diehards
from reacting to our assault.

32:50.790 --> 32:51.950
No, that's not my main concern.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.416
Reid and Prentiss know
what they need to do.

32:53.420 --> 32:56.321
-So what is your concern?
-Letting them know when we're coming.

32:56.330 --> 32:58.787
00 am.

32:58.790 --> 33:00.371
Come on, guys, quick.

33:00.380 --> 33:03.281
We need to get those bugs
in the boxes before it gets too cold.

33:04.620 --> 33:05.700
Perfect.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.247
Let's hope it's just that easy.

33:35.460 --> 33:38.202
If you can hear me,
I know you're coming.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.201
I can try to get the women and children
down to the tunnel,

33:40.210 --> 33:41.666
but I need to know when you're coming.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.167
-What is it?
-Prentiss. She's talking to us.

33:49.170 --> 33:51.161
If you can hear me,
I know you're coming.

33:51.170 --> 33:54.071
I can try to get the women and children
down to the tunnel,

33:54.080 --> 33:56.116
but I need to know
when you're coming.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.371
Let's go.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.746
I can try to get the women and children
down to the tunnel,

34:01.750 --> 34:03.490
but I need to know when you're coming.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.872
But I need to know when you're coming.

34:11.670 --> 34:14.662
If you can hear me,
I know you're coming.

34:14.670 --> 34:20.495
I can... Okay, okay, I got you.
What time

34:23.830 --> 34:24.956
00 am?

34:28.080 --> 34:29.490
Understood.

34:30.330 --> 34:33.493
Reid is on the first floor
somewhere with Cyrus.

34:33.500 --> 34:37.322
And please remember there are
children here. Someone's coming.

34:38.580 --> 34:39.706
Hold on, Emily.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.496
I know what you're thinking.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.612
You don't have to be a part of this.
You can go.

34:54.250 --> 34:58.072
I think I'd prefer to stay.
Somebody needs to tell your story.

34:58.790 --> 35:00.826
Then I'm glad it will be you.

35:00.830 --> 35:04.539
Now that the false believers
have been cleared from our midst,

35:05.500 --> 35:07.320
we make our final preparation.

35:31.790 --> 35:36.818
Cyrus is planning a mass suicide.
You made that 911 call.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.416
This is all my fault.

35:43.420 --> 35:47.379
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't made that call.

35:47.380 --> 35:49.575
You were trying to protect your daughter.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.822
There were other girls before Jesse.

35:52.830 --> 35:56.709
He would marry them in secret
and after a while he'd take another.

35:56.710 --> 35:59.577
And we weren't permitted to speak of it.

35:59.580 --> 36:03.414
And so when she asked
for my consent,

36:03.420 --> 36:08.039
I wanted to just take her and run.
But I was afraid she wouldn't leave him.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.610
You wanted us to take her.

36:09.620 --> 36:12.498
Well, I...
I wanted to save her from Cyrus.

36:13.120 --> 36:18.535
00 am.

36:19.170 --> 36:23.573
I need you to gather Jessica, the kids,
the other women.

36:23.580 --> 36:26.788
00 am.

36:26.790 --> 36:28.576
Why are you telling me this?

36:28.580 --> 36:32.209
Because I have faith
that you are a strong enough woman

36:32.210 --> 36:34.201
to do the right thing for Jessica.

36:45.540 --> 36:49.613
-I know I can't go in there.
-I'm going.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.112
If something happens to Prentiss
or Reid, I don't... I don't know...

36:57.420 --> 36:59.035
You're not alone.

37:31.210 --> 37:32.325
-Come on.
-What is it?

37:32.330 --> 37:34.286
Come on, come on.

37:46.920 --> 37:50.208
You were right.
They're setting the place to blow up.

37:50.210 --> 37:54.203
I told Jesse Cyrus wanted her
to gather the women and children.

37:54.210 --> 37:55.871
Where is the man I came in with?

37:55.880 --> 37:59.998
45, though. We've got to hurry.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.069
Something's wrong.

38:24.620 --> 38:28.283
Should we do it now?

38:30.500 --> 38:33.788
No. Let them get closer.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.325
Cyrus, what are you doing?

38:42.330 --> 38:44.787
Making sure the press is watching.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.537
They're going to want to see this.

38:55.170 --> 38:57.877
This is it.
Our moment of faith.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.615
Go, go, go, go!

39:23.960 --> 39:25.416
It came from inside the building.

39:25.420 --> 39:28.162
-Go check the fuses.
-Go.

39:33.290 --> 39:34.530
Emily! Emily, are you all right?

39:34.540 --> 39:35.996
-They've wired explosives.
-Everyone,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.286
Let's go. This way.

39:38.290 --> 39:39.951
Okay, this building's going to blow up.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.075
-If you love your children...
-Where's Reid?

39:41.080 --> 39:42.707
-...take them now and go.
-He's in the chapel with Cyrus.

39:42.710 --> 39:44.416
-We've gotta get you out of here.
-No, we gotta get Reid.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.116
Prentiss, I will get Reid.
Get out of here. Get to safety. Go now.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.704
Cyrus didn't call for this.
You lied to me.

39:50.710 --> 39:53.110
No. Cyrus lied to you, honey.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.951
I can't, I can't. He's my husband!

39:54.960 --> 39:58.327
-Hey, hey, hey! Hey, ma'am!
-Jesse! No!

39:58.330 --> 40:00.958
I will get her for you.
Rossi, get her out of here.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.667
Torre, get your boys, let's do this now.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.537
11
"I have for you, declares the Lord,

40:08.540 --> 40:10.826
"plans to prosper you
and not to harm you,

40:10.830 --> 40:12.821
"plans to bring you hope and a future."

40:12.830 --> 40:13.990
Is blowing yourself up

40:14.000 --> 40:15.877
part of the prosperous future
that God wants?

40:15.880 --> 40:17.996
You think you know the word better than I?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.240
No. And I'm just demonstrating

40:19.250 --> 40:21.821
that you can use the Bible
to manipulate anything.

40:21.830 --> 40:23.411
24,

40:23.420 --> 40:25.877
"Do not suppose that I have come
to the earth to bring peace.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.576
"I did not come to bring peace,
but a sword."

40:31.170 --> 40:33.491
You cannot convert my brothers.

40:47.750 --> 40:51.379
No one had to follow.
God could have stopped me.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.372
Clear!

41:01.880 --> 41:03.416
You all right, kid

41:03.420 --> 41:04.569
We got her out of here.

41:04.580 --> 41:06.491
Sweetheart, come with me.
We need to get you out of here.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.661
Come on, let's go right now.

41:15.380 --> 41:16.916
Run!

41:29.710 --> 41:31.746
Let's go. Let's go.
Move it through.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.787
Come on. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.496
Come on through.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.957
Let's go. Come on. This way.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.700
You're gonna be all right.

41:43.540 --> 41:48.660
Reid. Morgan

41:53.750 --> 41:55.706
We're okay.
-Oh, God!

42:03.210 --> 42:04.871
Two down over here.

42:05.460 --> 42:08.497
I think all the kids are out.
ROSSI: Where's Jesse?

42:33.120 --> 42:35.497
"Reason is not automatic.

42:35.500 --> 42:39.209
"Those who deny it cannot be
conquered by it." Ayn Rand.

42:45.710 --> 42:47.610
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:51.830 --> 42:55.072
Hey, I need you to listen to me.

42:56.460 --> 42:59.111
What Cyrus did to me is not your fault.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.032
It was my decision.
And I would do it again.

43:05.290 --> 43:06.871
Do you hear me?

43:12.040 --> 43:13.416
Thank you.
