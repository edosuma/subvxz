00:01.167 --> 00:03.102
LEMONIS:
Tonight on "The Profit"...

00:03.137 --> 00:04.136
How are you?

00:04.171 --> 00:06.305
...an actress comes home to Ohio

00:06.340 --> 00:09.241
to build
a health and home-goods brand.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.310
MONICA: I would make all of
my own essential-oil products

00:11.345 --> 00:12.978
with my dad, with my sisters.

00:13.014 --> 00:13.979
LEMONIS: You've seen real
results from this product,

00:14.015 --> 00:15.481
and other people have, too.

00:15.516 --> 00:19.485
But several years in, there's no
happy ending in sight.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.053
MONICA: I am crying more today

00:21.088 --> 00:23.055
than I have on seven seasons
of "Parenthood."

00:23.090 --> 00:25.791
LEMONIS: She won't let her team
make decisions,

00:25.826 --> 00:29.261
even though she lives and works
thousands of miles away.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.996
CAITY: You think I'm going
behind your back.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.798
I don't know how long
I can do it for.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.967
LEMONIS: She is resistant
to every change...

00:35.002 --> 00:36.301
MONICA: I hate it.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.736
LEMONIS: ...even though
the business loses

00:37.772 --> 00:40.305
almost $100,000 a year.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.307
You're throwing money
into the trash right now.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.344
And now the stress
is pulling her family apart.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.981
MONICA: [ VOICE BREAKING ]
Anybody who wants to support my
mom, [BLEEP] go for it.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.850
LEMONIS: If I can't convince her
to trust my process,

00:51.886 --> 00:56.355
Monica Potter Home may be
at risk of closing forever.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.590
MONICA: I just... I can't do it.
LEMONIS: Sit tight for a second.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.125
MONICA: I-I can't do any more.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.960
LEMONIS:
My name is Marcus Lemonis,

01:01.996 --> 01:05.364
and I risk my own money
to save struggling businesses.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.232
We're not gonna wake up
every morning

01:07.268 --> 01:08.467
wondering if we have a job.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.269
We're gonna wake up
every morning

01:10.304 --> 01:12.137
wondering how many jobs
we have to do.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.806
It's not always pretty.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.375
Everything's gonna change...
everything.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.878
But I do it to save jobs,
and I do it to make money.

01:19.914 --> 01:20.546
This...

01:20.581 --> 01:21.880
Let's go to work.

01:21.916 --> 01:22.981
...is "The Profit."

01:29.290 --> 01:30.989
You might recognize
Monica Potter

01:31.025 --> 01:33.892
from NBC's long-running series
"Parenthood."

01:33.928 --> 01:36.328
But when she's not making movies
or TV,

01:36.363 --> 01:38.497
she's making products
like skincare,

01:38.532 --> 01:40.566
room sprays, and candles

01:40.601 --> 01:44.169
and selling them through
her company, Monica Potter Home.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.904
MONICA: The best part
about the whole company

01:45.940 --> 01:48.340
is we are bringing jobs
back home.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.808
LEMONIS: A Cleveland native,

01:49.844 --> 01:52.211
Monica opened
her first retail store

01:52.246 --> 01:56.248
in nearby Garrettsville in 2014,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.317
employing her sister Jessica,

01:58.352 --> 02:01.053
along with other members
of the community.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.323
They soon found success
with their signature product...

02:04.358 --> 02:07.526
a balm that Monica
personally developed.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.127
MONICA: Sea Buckthorn Balm.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.663
People use it for eczema,
burns, scar tissue.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.532
It's made of
all natural ingredients.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.400
LEMONIS: Before long,
they opened a second shop

02:15.436 --> 02:17.436
in downtown Cleveland,

02:17.471 --> 02:21.540
and sales blossomed
to over 400,000 a year.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.676
But Monica's expenses?

02:24.712 --> 02:27.446
Well, they grew even faster.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.414
AL: Credit card's
basically maxed out.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.417
LEMONIS:
Today, the business loses money.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.952
Debts are piling up,

02:33.988 --> 02:37.222
and the downtown Cleveland store
has closed.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.624
MONICA:
I don't want this to fail,

02:38.659 --> 02:40.959
because if it fails,
you guys lose.

02:40.995 --> 02:43.095
LEMONIS:
The personal-care industry

02:43.130 --> 02:45.130
is extremely competitive,

02:45.166 --> 02:47.933
but having a celebrity
attached to the brand

02:47.968 --> 02:50.102
can separate it from the pack.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.271
So I'm headed to Monica's store
in Garrettsville.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.977
Oh, this is pretty.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.246
When I walk through
the front door,

03:01.282 --> 03:03.549
it had a warm and homey feel,

03:03.584 --> 03:06.985
but I spent time trying to find
these "skincare" products.

03:07.021 --> 03:10.255
I saw everything from scarves
to jewelry

03:10.291 --> 03:12.457
to greeting cards to dishes,

03:12.493 --> 03:15.594
but that isn't what I thought
I was coming to.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.129
Hi there.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.463
How are you? I'm Marcus.
JESSICA: Hi. Jessica.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.265
Hi. Nice to meet you.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.600
LEMONIS: Do you know
where Monica is?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.001
JESSICA: She should be here
any second.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.870
LEMONIS: Okay.
JESSICA: I'm her sister.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.638
LEMONIS: Oh, you're her sister?
JESSICA: Yeah, I'm her sister.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.007
LEMONIS: Okay.
I'm surprised she wasn't here.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.475
JESSICA: Yeah. Well...

03:30.511 --> 03:32.144
LEMONIS: You're surprised, too?
JESSICA: No.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.612
LEMONIS: You're not surprised?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.581
JESSICA: [ CHUCKLING ] You'll
get me in trouble.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.250
LEMONIS:
How often is Monica here?

03:38.285 --> 03:41.486
JESSICA: Once every, honestly,
month, couple months.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.155
LEMONIS: Every couple months?
JESSICA: Yes.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.690
LEMONIS: What do you do
for the business?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.692
JESSICA: In the beginning,
I started it with her,

03:46.727 --> 03:48.527
with the product line.
I was kind of...

03:48.562 --> 03:49.561
LEMONIS: Where's
the product line?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.966
JESSICA: Very, very first
product that we ever had

03:54.001 --> 03:54.967
was a candle.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.235
LEMONIS: Okay.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.037
What's the reason that you guys
started the business?

03:59.073 --> 04:02.307
JESSICA: This has always been
a passion of hers.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.643
My dad was an inventor.
We're very creative people.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.311
LEMONIS: Parents still around?
JESSICA: My mom is.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.779
Dad passed.
LEMONIS: Dad passed away.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.648
Your family's here.
JESSICA: Yeah. We're here.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.984
LEMONIS: Okay.
And what are all these products?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.152
JESSICA: This is kind of
Monica's baby right here.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.288
It is a product that...

04:16.322 --> 04:18.190
It's all natural, made from
the sea buckthorn berry.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.725
LEMONIS: And why do you say
it's her baby?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.459
JESSICA:
She had eczema as a kid,

04:21.495 --> 04:24.663
and it's good for scars, burns,
psoriasis, eczema.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.032
LEMONIS: It's obvious to me
that Monica has come up with

04:27.067 --> 04:29.067
something unique
with the sea buckthorn,

04:29.103 --> 04:31.570
but in order to
really demonstrate that,

04:31.605 --> 04:34.306
you want to have the packaging
reflect the uniqueness.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.642
The jar, to me,
looks like somebody just

04:36.677 --> 04:39.745
bought a jar off the shelf
and slapped a label on it.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.713
So who's in charge of the store?

04:41.749 --> 04:43.749
JESSICA: Right now, officially,
Caity.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.485
LEMONIS: And where's Caity's at?
JESSICA: Caity is...

04:46.520 --> 04:47.586
She's back here.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.154
CAITY: I'm Caity.
Nice to meet you.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.056
LEMONIS: I'm Marcus.
CAITY: Thanks for coming.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.158
LEMONIS: So you're really the
person that runs this business?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.493
CAITY: Yes.
LEMONIS: Okay.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.661
CAITY: But with the help
of an amazing team.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.662
LEMONIS: Do you guys
sell online?

04:56.697 --> 04:57.829
JESSICA: We do.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.698
LEMONIS:
How much does the Web do?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.601
CAITY: It varies. We're really
trying to increase Web sales,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.069
but right now, year to date,

05:04.104 --> 05:05.704
our average
is about $2,700 a week,

05:05.739 --> 05:07.439
and our goal is more like
$5,000 a week.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.241
LEMONIS: Oh!

05:09.276 --> 05:12.511
JESSICA: Speak of the devil.
MONICA: You guys, I am so sorry.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.279
Hi.
LEMONIS: How are you?

05:14.315 --> 05:16.048
MONICA: You're really cute.
LEMONIS: Nice... thank you.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.649
But you're really late.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.218
MONICA: I said I was sorry.
LEMONIS: I'm kidding.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.353
JESSICA: [ LAUGHS ]

05:22.389 --> 05:24.389
LEMONIS: Talk to me
about the store.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.124
What are you thinking about?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.360
MONICA:
This store and the website

05:28.395 --> 05:30.462
are both extensions of my home.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.531
LEMONIS: Everybody said you
don't spend much time here.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.700
MONICA: I don't.
LEMONIS: Why?

05:34.735 --> 05:37.369
MONICA: Because my job
and my kids are in Los Angeles.

05:37.404 --> 05:38.704
LEMONIS: Makes sense.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.139
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Monica Potter.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.141
MONICA: Hi.
LEMONIS: Come on in.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.776
MONICA: How are you?
WOMAN: Hi.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.212
LEMONIS: How are you,
by the way? I'm Marcus.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.081
KALI: I'm good. I'm Kali.
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.150
Okay, so I want to understand
who the full-time crew is.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.486
Caity, Kali.
ADRIENNE: Hi. I'm Adrienne.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.088
LEMONIS: Adrienne,
nice to meet you.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.489
ADRIENNE: Nice to meet you.
LEMONIS: Adrienne.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.158
So can you guys
walk me through the store?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.494
It's a bit of sensory overload
for me.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.297
Like, I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to

06:05.332 --> 06:06.665
focus on if I came in here.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.800
Who buys all of this... Monica?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.602
JESSICA:
Monica has a say in it, yeah.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.738
LEMONIS: Like, who picked this?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.306
JESSICA: That I did not pick.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.508
LEMONIS: Don't know?
JESSICA: It's... I...

06:16.543 --> 06:18.677
LEMONIS:
Who picked stuff like this?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.645
CAITY: Kali actually purchased
the angel stuff.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.147
Monica is big into angels,

06:22.182 --> 06:23.482
so she wanted to have

06:23.517 --> 06:26.918
some angel-inspired items in the
store, so we purchased these.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.654
LEMONIS: And the dishes?
JESSICA: That's probably Caity.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.356
LEMONIS: And the clothes?

06:31.392 --> 06:32.491
JESSICA: The shirts were Monica.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.658
LEMONIS: And the scarves?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.494
JESSICA:
That would have been Caity.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.296
LEMONIS: Okay, it looks like you
guys basically just buy stuff

06:38.332 --> 06:39.631
and put your sticker on it.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.299
Like, is there a buying plan?

06:41.335 --> 06:42.601
JESSICA: No. I don't know.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.302
LEMONIS: 'Cause I look around,

06:44.338 --> 06:46.505
and I see bowls and scarves
and popcorn and coffee.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.540
It's like,
Am I at a country store?

06:48.575 --> 06:51.143
Am I at a five-and-dime shop?
Am I at a flea market?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.310
I don't know where I'm at.

06:52.346 --> 06:57.382
♪♪

06:57.418 --> 06:58.950
So all this stuff they've just
collected over the years?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.819
ADRIENNE: Yeah.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.455
KALI: Me and her have started
throwing a lot of things away.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.824
ADRIENNE: Just making decisions.
KALI: We know it's junk.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.793
KALI: But we're also told a lot,

07:07.828 --> 07:10.595
"Don't throw it away,
'cause we'll know."

07:10.631 --> 07:12.664
LEMONIS: You guys have
a lot of good stuff in here.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.567
MONICA: I already know where
you're going with this.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.569
LEMONIS: How much money do you
think is locked up in here...

07:17.604 --> 07:21.406
$50,000, $60,000?

07:21.442 --> 07:22.808
So how many times have you guys

07:22.843 --> 07:25.877
tried to sell stuff
or get rid of stuff?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.712
ADRIENNE: We had a yard sale
this summer.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.248
LEMONIS: Did Monica
know about it?

07:30.284 --> 07:31.650
KALI: I don't know. Did you?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.418
MONICA: You guys,
this is the [BLEEP] problem.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.653
There's no communication.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.823
So if I'm e-mailing you, like...

07:37.858 --> 07:39.324
ADRIENNE: No, it's not...

07:39.359 --> 07:41.259
I don't mean it
to come across that way.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.494
MONICA: No, for real.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.728
No, it's like you guys
are afraid.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.363
You can't walk on eggshells
with me.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.732
Tell me so we can address it.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.235
LEMONIS: It's a little odd
that this early on,

07:50.270 --> 07:52.871
the business owner would go
from cold to hot so quickly.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.506
And what I'm sensing is that

07:54.541 --> 07:56.708
there is this undertone of
tension that exists

07:56.743 --> 07:59.277
between the people

MONICA: The lip balm.
LEMONIS: This is the buckthorn.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.808
MONICA: I had eczema growing up,
and everyone always said to me,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.543
"What do you use on your skin?"

08:31.578 --> 08:34.379
And I would make all of my own
essential-oil products

MONICA: That are tangible.

ingredients that you believe
create the difference.

LEMONIS: 50% of the revenue?
AL: Probably more.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.606
LEMONIS: And what are the
margins on these two products?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.608

on both of those is 82%.

What's the total revenue
that you guys do as a company?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.479

break your revenue down?

that make up the $450,000?

LEMONIS: Is that one?

We do manufactured goods.

The next category?

09:25.465 --> 09:26.631
AL: Branded wholesale.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.967
LEMONIS: Private-labeled
products where you source them,

09:29.002 --> 09:30.468
and you put your brand on them.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.637
AL: Yes. $45,000, $50,000.
LEMONIS: Okay.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.373

the items, some apparel,

out there

Monica Potter brand on them.

that you buy and resell.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.114
AL: Right.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.717
LEMONIS: It's clear to me
that this company needs to

09:45.752 --> 09:48.019
get very focused
on the manufactured products...

09:48.055 --> 09:50.722
those are the skincare products,
like sea buckthorn...

09:50.757 --> 09:53.124
because their margins
are exceptional.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.728

more attention to that.

Do you guys have defined roles?

in this business.

Sometimes I end up having
communication issues with Monica

10:09.076 --> 10:10.075
due to her schedule.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.277
I was hired to make decisions.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.412

do those things

10:14.448 --> 10:16.815

I'm going behind your back.

interests at heart.

thought about quitting before?

I had nothing enough to offer
to help this business.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.602
I didn't want to fail her,

"I got to get out of here.

I'm turning into
a crazy person."

10:42.509 --> 10:44.509
JESSICA: Yeah. I missed it.
I missed the customers.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.379
LEMONIS: You can sense that Jess
has a level of insecurity.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.381
I don't know if the reason
is because

10:49.416 --> 10:52.083
Monica wants to
drive the process.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.586
LEMONIS: Have you always
struggled with self-confidence.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.788
MONICA: Can I answer? Yes.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.823
JESSICA: I guess.
LEMONIS: Why?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.894
JESSICA: Because she went
and did the acting thing,

11:02.929 --> 11:04.929
and she's very successful.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.432

apologize any more for, like,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.140
"I'm not good at something."

11:15.175 --> 11:17.075

everybody's good at,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.777

what they're not good at.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.879
JESSICA: I think, too, Marcus,
what I try to do

11:20.914 --> 11:22.814
is tell her what to do,

11:22.849 --> 11:27.485
and I can be extremely critical,
because I'm critical of myself.

11:27.521 --> 11:31.122
LEMONIS: I think when Jess
compares her life to Monica's,

11:31.158 --> 11:33.458
she feels less significant.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.927
and enables Monica
to take control.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.730
Let's you and I go outside
and get away from everybody.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.833
The family dynamic in a business
like this really has an impact,

11:41.868 --> 11:43.735
so I want to take Monica aside

11:43.770 --> 11:47.138
and see if I can get a little
bit deeper on this issue.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.908
What was the real reason
you started with this?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.643
MONICA: My dad.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.945
When I was little,
I would go to the factory

11:53.980 --> 11:55.647
where he made fishing lures.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.116
I felt, you know,
very inspired by that.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.786
And his products were good,
and we have great products.

12:01.822 --> 12:07.258
And so it's just like with
my dad, this goes way deeper.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.827
My dad thought
I was gonna be a boy,

12:08.862 --> 12:12.030
so he designated me
the boy of the family.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.132
And a week before he died,
he was like,

12:14.167 --> 12:17.535
"Make sure you take care
of your mom and your sisters."

12:17.571 --> 12:20.205
LEMONIS: I think she's convinced
herself that she was ultimately

12:20.240 --> 12:23.541
now responsible
to be everybody's caregiver.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.744
And I think when she took
that role,

12:25.779 --> 12:28.813
Jess accepted
that that was Monica's role.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.082
And that's why there's
this tension between them.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.988
So, what's the revenue for 2016?

12:37.023 --> 12:40.024
AL: Total gross sales
were $427,000.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.793
LEMONIS: Okay.
That's a good number.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.495

LEMONIS: Yeah.

are $20,000.

And so there's a $6,000 loss
a month, or $72,000 a year.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.849

that $72,000 loss come from?

AL: In 2017, it has been funded
by our payables.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.257

16:38.131 --> 16:39.864
LEMONIS: How much did you spend
doing that?

16:39.899 --> 16:41.265
Just the actual product
development.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.535
MONICA: You're smart.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.371
LEMONIS: Probably what?
MONICA: $100,000.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.373
LEMONIS: Right.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.208
We got a deal?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.143
MONICA: Deal.
LEMONIS: It's your check.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.312
MONICA: Can I give you a hug?
LEMONIS: You can.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.281
MONICA: Okay. That's my deal.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.851
LEMONIS: Bye.
MONICA: Thank you. Bye.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.185
I'll see you soon.
LEMONIS: See you soon.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.387
MONICA: Travel safe.
LEMONIS: Thank you.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.421
MONICA: Thank you, Dad.

17:11.397 --> 17:15.233
LEMONIS: So, I agreed to invest
$100,000 into the business.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.902
I would like to invest
in you guys.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.303
But at the end of the day,

17:19.339 --> 17:21.138
this business can't be managed
from California.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.907
Who's in charge
of this business today?

17:23.943 --> 17:25.977
AL: Day-to-day operations
is Caity.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.378
LEMONIS: Okay, and we're gonna
respect that leadership.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.215
Once we build out what this
business needs to look like,

17:31.251 --> 17:33.151
Jess, I want to work directly
with you

17:33.186 --> 17:35.653
to try to figure out what
a perfect role is here for you.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.155
What would you want to do?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.923
JESSICA: You know,
business isn't my thing.

17:38.958 --> 17:41.325
I did take photography,
and I did go to art school.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.494
LEMONIS: Jess, if something
like that interests you,

17:43.530 --> 17:45.196
I'd like to help you do that.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.198
MONICA: I don't know
if that's the right decision.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.068
I need to okay what she does.
This is the stuff that...

17:50.103 --> 17:52.103
LEMONIS:
Yeah, we're moving forward.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.038
MONICA: I get that. But it still
needs to be addressed.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.373
Jessica...
JESSICA: No, it's okay.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.408
MONICA: I think
the biggest problem is...

17:57.444 --> 17:59.544
JESSICA: It's okay.
That's why I walked away...

17:59.579 --> 18:03.347
'cause I felt like a piss-on.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.083
All right?

18:05.118 --> 18:08.419
LEMONIS: You can sense that Jess
has a level of insecurity,

18:08.455 --> 18:10.054
and she became subservient

18:10.090 --> 18:12.523
'cause Monica wants to
drive the process.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.293
And so rather than her
trying to compete with Monica,

18:15.328 --> 18:17.028
she just pulls back.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.963
LEMONIS: That's okay.
We're gonna work through it.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.266
We just have to get everybody
in the right roles

18:22.302 --> 18:24.001
so that everybody
can be successful

18:24.037 --> 18:25.970
and we can sell product
and everybody can smile again.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.905
We got to know what inventory
is in this building

18:27.941 --> 18:28.940
and how much cash is here.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.608
We got to get it freed up.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.578
We have to rebuild the website
and get every product on here,

18:33.613 --> 18:35.947
and if it doesn't belong,
we got to get rid of it.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.483
We're gonna do more research
about the sea buckthorn.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.551
We're gonna want to
create scents around it.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.553
We're gonna want to create
other products around it

18:42.589 --> 18:44.422
and build the whole lineup.
MONICA: Scents?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.057
LEMONIS: Yeah.
MONICA: That's so cool.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.092
LEMONIS: That's it.
It's literally that simple.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.297
If you liquidated everything
in this building

18:53.333 --> 18:56.501
other than the things
that you absolutely had to have,

18:56.536 --> 18:58.236
how many SKUs would be left?

18:58.271 --> 19:00.304
MONICA: Oh, can I just show you?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.739
LEMONIS: Can we put them down
right here?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.174
MONICA: Yeah. Let's do it.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.575
LEMONIS: Everybody grab
the things

19:04.611 --> 19:06.978
that they absolutely
cannot live without.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.679
In order to develop
a brand strategy,

19:08.715 --> 19:11.015
I'm having the team
choose the top sellers

19:11.050 --> 19:13.251
so we can determine
what we're gonna sell online

19:13.286 --> 19:14.752
and in the store.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.621
CAITY: One's essential oil.
One's fragrance oil.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.657
JESSICA: The summer is our first
candle ever that we ever made.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.758
LEMONIS: We'll have
a whole candle lineup.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.527
MONICA: Great.

19:22.562 --> 19:26.297
The essential oil, sea buck,
and the full-size barn box.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.633
LEMONIS: The box thing
is a great way

19:28.668 --> 19:30.635
to create gifts, centerpieces.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.204
MONICA: Yeah.
LEMONIS: Anything missing?

19:33.239 --> 19:36.374
MONICA: Um...
Yes, actually, a textile.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.343
LEMONIS: It's in the store.
Grab it, okay?

19:39.379 --> 19:43.214
LEMONIS:
I'm comfortable moving forward
based on four categories...

19:43.249 --> 19:46.050
textiles and paper, number one,

19:46.085 --> 19:48.653
room scents, number two,

19:48.688 --> 19:51.155
gift box, number three,

19:51.191 --> 19:53.491
and then body care and skincare.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.725
Now that we have
the four categories

19:54.761 --> 19:56.194
that we're
gonna move forward with,

19:56.229 --> 19:57.595
we can develop a plan

19:57.630 --> 20:00.398
of how we're gonna sell online
and in the store.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.466
Each category is scalable.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.136
For example,
in the textile category,

20:05.171 --> 20:08.339
adding more scarves, linen,
and paper will increase sales.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.676
In the home fragrance category,
we can develop more candles,

20:11.711 --> 20:15.546
room sprays, and diffusers,
including seasonal scents.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.316
The body care category
includes a number of items,

20:18.351 --> 20:20.685
but it is anchored by
Monica's signature product,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.220
the Sea Buckthorn Balm.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.689
And the last category
is the gift boxes,

20:24.724 --> 20:27.391
allowing customers
to compile the things

20:27.427 --> 20:29.060
from the previous three
categories

20:29.095 --> 20:30.595
and create great gifting items.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.730
So is everybody on board

20:32.765 --> 20:35.533
on this is the business plan
moving forward?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.168
MONICA: I don't agree to that
right now.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.337
I'm not gonna agree to that.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.607
LEMONIS: What was the point
of all this, then?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.475
MONICA: I need to think about it
for a second.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.244
I really do.
I'm not gonna be put on...

20:46.279 --> 20:48.212
This took a long time to evolve.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.048
LEMONIS: Obviously, I know there
is extensions of this missing,

20:51.084 --> 20:52.516
and the full collection
is missing.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.019
MONICA: Got it.
Yeah, okay. Then I'm on board.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.855
Because we're basically
coming full circle,

20:57.890 --> 20:59.257
which is really cool.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.825
LEMONIS: Okay.
CAITY: Yeah, it is.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.228
LEMONIS: Awesome.
MONICA: Yeah.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.734
LEMONIS: Caity?
CAITY: Mm-hmm?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.202
LEMONIS: Do you think maybe
the three of us

21:11.237 --> 21:12.270
can just sit down for a minute?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.604
CAITY: Sure.
JESSICA: Yeah.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.206
LEMONIS: We've made some
really good progress

21:15.241 --> 21:17.141
in narrowing down
the four categories,

21:17.176 --> 21:19.143
and now Jess, Caity,
and I are gonna sit down

21:19.178 --> 21:22.413
to understand what's Jess' role
gonna be going forward.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.081
JESSICA: I'm all screwed up.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.449
LEMONIS: So I thought maybe
the two of you guys

21:25.485 --> 21:28.519
could just talk about, how do we
make this work for everybody?

21:28.554 --> 21:30.554
CAITY: We have had issues
in the past with the dynamic

21:30.590 --> 21:34.392
between Jess and Monica that has
caused chaos across the board

21:34.427 --> 21:37.728
because of the arguments
or whatever that you have

21:37.764 --> 21:39.463
on a personal level,
being sisters.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.132
If Jessica is around,

21:41.167 --> 21:44.235
Monica will call her and say,
"What's going on?"

21:44.270 --> 21:46.370
Or, "FaceTime me. I want to see
everybody's desks."

21:46.406 --> 21:47.672
JESSICA: It does put me
in a bad...

21:47.707 --> 21:49.140
LEMONIS: Stop it.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.609
Monica!
MONICA: Yeah.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.479
LEMONIS: So, we were just
talking about,

21:55.515 --> 22:00.418
in order for this relationship
to work between Jess and Caity,

22:00.453 --> 22:03.254
they have to be able
to communicate

22:03.289 --> 22:06.123
without any
outside distractions.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.727
MONICA: That's great.
Like, I really want you
to understand that's great.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.263
I want you
to feel good about you.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.765
Like, I see so much of Dad
in you sometimes,

22:14.801 --> 22:17.702
and it pisses me off because
you're so [BLEEP] talented,

22:17.737 --> 22:19.403
and I think it goes deeper.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.205
JESSICA: I mean, we were treated
different by our dad,

22:21.240 --> 22:22.273
if you want to go way back.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.743
It's just
we were treated different.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.680
MONICA: I can't handle this.
JESSICA: I'm proud of her.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.215
LEMONIS: Tell her now.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.616
JESSICA: She knows how proud
I am of her

22:32.652 --> 22:34.352
and the things she does
for people

22:34.387 --> 22:36.187
or the things
she's succeeded at.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.522
MONICA: [ VOICE BREAKING ] I
just need to go for a ride.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.559
I'm tired of the resentment.
[ BLEEP ]

22:41.594 --> 22:43.694
If anybody wants to support
my mom

22:43.730 --> 22:46.330
and the [BLEEP]
city of Cleveland,

22:46.366 --> 22:47.531
then [BLEEP] go for it.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.472
JESSICA: Monica is
very resistant to change.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.474
She is a self-sabotager.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.409
LEMONIS: Are you comfortable
moving forward

22:58.444 --> 23:00.578
with not derailing the process?

23:00.613 --> 23:01.679
Tell the truth.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.719
MONICA: [ VOICE BREAKING ] I'm
tired of the resentment.

23:08.755 --> 23:13.557
I was told what I had to do to
take care of the [BLEEP] family.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.761
I'm tired. I'm tired.

23:16.796 --> 23:17.828
No, Marcus.
LEMONIS: Yes.

23:17.864 --> 23:18.996
MONICA: I need to go for a ride.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.631
LEMONIS:
You're not going anywhere.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.400
MONICA: Yes, I am.
LEMONIS: Monica, look at me.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.434
MONICA: I am tired.
LEMONIS: I know you are.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.302
MONICA: I'm [BLEEP] tired of it.

23:25.338 --> 23:28.506
A week before my father died,
I told you what he said to me.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.275
Because I was the golden child
and the favorite,

23:31.310 --> 23:32.943
that comes with a price.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.679
LEMONIS: But you're putting
some of that on yourself, too.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.680
MONICA: Of course I am.

23:36.716 --> 23:39.016
LEMONIS: It's clear to me
that Monica's dad

23:39.051 --> 23:40.518
has had a huge impact on her,

23:40.553 --> 23:42.386
and it's put a lot of pressure
on her.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.655
And she has this notion
that she has to put

23:44.690 --> 23:46.857
everything and everybody
on her shoulders.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.659
Come on. Let's go.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.494
If this is gonna get resolved

23:50.530 --> 23:53.664
and not continue to impact
the business in a negative way,

23:53.699 --> 23:55.933
then we're gonna need to have
an open dialogue

23:55.968 --> 23:57.568
that involves everyone.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.604
I think Monica feels like

24:00.640 --> 24:02.640
she's supposed to carry
the torch of your husband.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.109
NANCY: Yeah,
and she doesn't have to.

24:05.144 --> 24:08.012
That makes me feel bad,
'cause I can't help you.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.613
I don't know what to do.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.482
JESSICA: And by the way,
he was a great dad.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.017
I just want to make that clear.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.719
MONICA: I'm not saying
that he wasn't a good father.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.556
JESSICA: But you're carrying
this pressure that you feel

24:18.591 --> 24:19.890
that's been on you.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.325
MONICA:
Mom, you shouldn't feel guilty.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.660
NANCY: Well, I do.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.395
MONICA: Don't. Please don't.
NANCY: I do.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.130
MONICA: Please don't.
[ VOICE BREAKING ] I love you.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.833
NANCY: Maybe it's good
it came out.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.369
LEMONIS: You guys needed to have
this conversation.

24:32.405 --> 24:33.804
I think we're in a better place.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.539
Let's take a little break.
Let's get some food.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.007
Let's take it down a notch.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.009
This was a good conversation
for everybody, right?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.419
Good morning.
MONICA: Good morning.

24:48.454 --> 24:49.753
JESSICA: Hi.
LEMONIS: Are you ready?

24:49.789 --> 24:51.021
JESSICA: Yeah!
LEMONIS: All right. Let's do it.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.556
JESSICA: All right.
LEMONIS: Come on.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.024
Today, I'm bringing the team
to a meeting

24:54.060 --> 24:55.993
that I've set up
in Pennsylvania.

24:56.028 --> 24:59.396
It's with the Emerson Group,
one of the largest distributors

24:59.432 --> 25:01.999
of personal-care products
to the retail industry.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.100
MATT: Welcome.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.902
Hi. I'm Matt.
JESSICA: Jessica.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.604

LEMONIS: I'm hoping that we can
get some professional feedback

25:11.077 --> 25:14.044
on the Monica Potter branding
and to get some advice

25:14.080 --> 25:16.046
on how we can get
the sea buckthorn product

25:16.082 --> 25:17.982
into stores nationally.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.552
MATT:
We did experience the product,

25:21.587 --> 25:24.321
and so I want to know a little
bit more from your perspective

25:24.357 --> 25:27.758
how this is different relative
to other brands in the category.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.027
MONICA: We developed it because
I grew up with eczema,

25:30.062 --> 25:33.597
and people started using it
for a variety of ailments.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.900
Every home should have this.
MATT: But why?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.435
What you've got to do
is you've got to tell them why.

25:38.471 --> 25:41.438
The consumer that's walking in
a retailer today,

25:41.474 --> 25:44.441
they are not gonna know
what sea buckthorn is.

25:44.477 --> 25:46.110
For a business of your size,

25:46.145 --> 25:48.812
the packaging is gonna be
your number-one communication.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.614
I can appreciate
some of the elements

25:50.650 --> 25:53.117
where you want some of the
Monica Potter branding in there.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.653
And that's a little bit
of a differentiator, as well,

25:55.688 --> 25:57.087
and that may help it stand out.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.622
MONICA: Well,
that's a huge differentiator.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.790

But not everybody knows you.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.592
There are people that know you,

26:01.627 --> 26:03.661
but not everybody knows you
that would use this product.

Will the consumer care
that it's coming from you?

26:06.499 --> 26:08.999
DEBRA: And in 10,000 stores,
it's gonna be hard to do.

anything to say

what all this means to her,

it will be successful.

my feeling of your line

And I think it would be
really awesome

36:09.868 --> 36:11.902
for every line
to have its own unique pattern.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.304
So we could have a lavender
