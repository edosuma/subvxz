01:31.520 --> 01:33.620
It is said abroad in the parish

reading of dangerous books.

the hidden mysteries of magic

01:41.897 --> 01:43.731
and of enchantments.

01:43.733 --> 01:44.564
No, no, no, Sir!

01:44.566 --> 01:45.498
That's not true.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.900
You are summarily accused

01:47.902 --> 01:51.103
of sorcery, witchcraft

01:51.105 --> 01:52.806
and necromancy.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.006
No, no, no, Sir!

01:54.008 --> 01:55.608
That's all lies.

01:55.610 --> 01:59.981
See, like his master Beelzebub,
he is a consummate liar.

02:01.149 --> 02:02.650
As we watched you from
amongst the trees,

02:02.652 --> 02:06.520
I, the captain and his
men here all plainly heard

02:06.522 --> 02:09.021
you calling for
your daughter Lydia.

02:09.024 --> 02:12.258
And yet, it is known
abroad that your daughter

02:12.260 --> 02:15.028
is dead these past nine months.

02:15.030 --> 02:16.496
Sir!

02:16.498 --> 02:20.166
Furthermore, since her
passing, Lydia has been seen

02:20.168 --> 02:22.603
walking here in Jacob's Wood.

02:22.605 --> 02:26.442
What greater proof of sorcery
does any God-fearing man need?

02:28.378 --> 02:31.679
Why Sir, Lydia
is my cat's name.

02:31.681 --> 02:35.249
I named her thus to keep alive
the memory of my daughter.

02:35.251 --> 02:36.817
By my troth tis true.

02:36.819 --> 02:39.453
Why you are a slippery fellow.

02:39.455 --> 02:42.490
Be not deceived by
this wily gentleman.

02:42.492 --> 02:44.991
Through his practise
of the dark arts.

02:44.993 --> 02:48.529
His familiar may appear
at his side in many forms.

02:48.531 --> 02:53.536
Be it dog or cat, owl
or bat, toad or rat.

02:54.705 --> 02:57.839
Yet ye may be certain
that it is his daughter

02:57.841 --> 03:01.242

Satan's unholy power.

03:01.244 --> 03:03.910
Sir, you do belie me.

03:03.912 --> 03:05.846
I'm innocent of this charge.

03:05.848 --> 03:07.381
Confess!

03:07.383 --> 03:10.084
Confess man that you may
be free of hell torments.

03:10.086 --> 03:11.419
Please I'm innocent.

03:11.421 --> 03:14.155
See, as he lies to
our faces, he prepares

03:14.157 --> 03:16.924
a restorative ointment
for his familiar.

03:16.926 --> 03:20.128
Without it, the ghouls
corrupt flesh will rot

03:20.130 --> 03:23.964
and turn to dust as
all godly flesh must.

03:23.966 --> 03:24.932
Why sir.

03:24.934 --> 03:27.268
That is my supper.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.770
Oh, is that so?

03:28.772 --> 03:31.640
Well I will not keep
a man from his supper.

03:31.642 --> 03:34.110
Come, let us see you dine.

03:35.412 --> 03:36.745
You see?

03:36.747 --> 03:38.346
He will not stomach it.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.717
It is as I said, an unholy sow.

03:42.319 --> 03:44.352
Here's a sorcerer.

me, Professor Edwards?

05:55.718 --> 05:57.151
Yes, yes, I certainly do.

05:57.153 --> 05:58.354
Sit down Isabelle.

05:59.823 --> 06:00.824
Take a look at this.

06:05.094 --> 06:06.795
You recognise it?

06:06.797 --> 06:09.531
Yes, it's the
Stearne Cauldron.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.566
So named because it
was amongst the effects

06:11.568 --> 06:14.368
of John Stearne,
associate Matthew Hopkins,

06:14.370 --> 06:17.739
the so-called Witch
Finder General.

06:17.741 --> 06:18.941
It's in the civil war collection

06:18.943 --> 06:20.441
because that's the time
they were operating,

06:20.443 --> 06:23.144
but the cauldron is in
fact much older than that,

06:23.146 --> 06:26.415
quite possibly Celtic
or pre-Roman period.

06:26.417 --> 06:27.950
PROF.: Hmm mm.

06:27.952 --> 06:30.218
Are these pictures from
when it was discovered?

06:30.220 --> 06:31.520
Yes.

06:31.522 --> 06:33.390
And no.

06:34.391 --> 06:35.425
Take a closer look.

06:37.895 --> 06:38.829
My goodness!

06:39.997 --> 06:41.162
This isn't our half
of the cauldron is it?

06:41.164 --> 06:42.664
It's the missing half.

06:42.666 --> 06:43.899
Well it might be.

06:43.901 --> 06:45.801
That's what I want
you to find out.

06:45.803 --> 06:48.236
The photos and the
letter were sent to me

06:48.238 --> 06:50.572
by a chap in Shropshire,

06:50.574 --> 06:53.609
one Karl Scott-Morton.

06:53.611 --> 06:54.978
Bit of an eccentric I think,

06:54.980 --> 06:56.345
apparently doesn't have a phone,

06:56.347 --> 06:57.716
communicates only by letter.

06:59.116 --> 07:00.882
Anyway it seems he was
doing some renovation work

07:00.884 --> 07:03.418
to his stately pile
and discovered it

07:03.420 --> 07:05.621
buried beneath the
floor in his cellar.

07:05.623 --> 07:07.857
At least that's what he says.

07:07.859 --> 07:11.393
He may, of course, be aware
of our half of the cauldron

07:11.395 --> 07:15.531
and knocked up a fake in the
hope of raising some funds.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.066
Do you think it's genuine?

07:17.068 --> 07:19.602
Well I'd like to of course.

07:19.604 --> 07:22.138
The fact that it's still
partially in the ground

07:22.140 --> 07:24.475
suggests it might be, but...

07:25.977 --> 07:28.678
You only have to look at the
British Museum's experience

07:28.680 --> 07:31.380
with the Risley
Park Lanx to realise

07:31.382 --> 07:34.951
there are some awful
crooks out there.

07:34.953 --> 07:37.153
Yes, but the lanx
was completely lost

07:37.155 --> 07:38.655
and then rediscovered.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.790
We at least have the half
of the cauldron already.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.761
Indeed we do, which should
give you a distinct advantage

07:43.763 --> 07:46.197
when you come to look at
Mr. Scott-Morton's half.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.133

you were up to it,

The professor's given
me some of the background,

11:05.399 --> 11:07.600
but how did you come
across the cauldron?

11:07.602 --> 11:09.836
Well we've been undertaking
some renovation work

11:09.838 --> 11:12.572
of the house, part of
which was the installation

11:12.574 --> 11:14.074
of a new gas main.

11:14.076 --> 11:17.577
Once we were excavating for
it, we uncovered the cauldron.

11:17.579 --> 11:20.081
Well I was aware of the
Stearne Cauldron of course.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.817
But not wanting to
risk damaging it,

11:22.819 --> 11:25.220
I thought it best
to give you a call.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.854
I'm looking
forward to seeing it.

11:27.856 --> 11:29.089
Good!

11:29.091 --> 11:31.359
I hope you'll be
comfortable here.

11:31.361 --> 11:34.928
Tomorrow you can make a start
removing it from the ground.

11:34.930 --> 11:37.131

better introduce you

Why don't I show
you to your room dear.

11:58.154 --> 12:01.190
The house was a girl's
boarding school many years ago.

12:02.525 --> 12:04.492
I'm afraid we haven't managed
to restore it entirely

12:04.494 --> 12:07.931
back to its former glory
as a country house.

12:14.569 --> 12:17.740

will change soon.

very comfortable.

12:29.153 --> 12:30.484

12:30.486 --> 12:31.686
Yes, they're mine.

chance to do that sort of thing

anymore, just the odd bit
of sewing and dressmaking.

I didn't want to go anymore.

the house in the 1800s.

21:04.008 --> 21:05.878
Are you imagining things?

21:07.580 --> 21:11.782
Last night I was sleeping
peacefully and now,

21:11.784 --> 21:15.788
I'm trying to dance, peacefully.

mean to interrupt you.

you dance beautifully.

we realised what it was

21:43.350 --> 21:46.016
I stopped the men from
digging any further,

21:46.018 --> 21:48.285
for fear of damaging it.

commercial value.

my custom of an afternoon

39:50.455 --> 39:53.456
was to take the airs
and walk abroad.

39:53.458 --> 39:56.227
Familiarising myself
with my new surroundings.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.731
On one such excursion, I
found myself on the fringes

40:00.733 --> 40:04.968
of Jacob's Wood, a particularly
wild and ancient place,

40:04.970 --> 40:06.168
grown all the more so

40:06.170 --> 40:09.305
because local men
fear to venture there.

40:09.307 --> 40:11.942
I have ascertained this because
there are some persistent

40:11.944 --> 40:14.443
rumours of witchcraft
which have led

40:14.445 --> 40:16.913
to this wood being
shunned by all.

40:16.915 --> 40:20.519
In this age of reason, such
beliefs seem to me ridiculous.

40:22.321 --> 40:25.255
As I walked along the
tangled fringe of the wood

40:25.257 --> 40:27.724
I fancied I heard curious music

40:27.726 --> 40:30.061
faintly drifting on the wind.

40:30.063 --> 40:32.664
Intrigued, I stopped
and listened.

40:32.666 --> 40:35.699
The thin, piping melody
seemed to be emanating

40:35.701 --> 40:38.135
from the dark
boughs of the wood,

40:38.137 --> 40:40.470
and being aware of
the local reputation,

40:40.472 --> 40:42.074
my curiosity was pricked.

40:42.975 --> 40:45.175
I determined to find its source.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.912
I struck out into the wood,
which having being left

40:47.914 --> 40:50.213
abandoned and uncoppiced
for many years

40:50.215 --> 40:51.785
was dense and overgrown.

40:57.256 --> 41:00.457
Eventually, I came
to a small clearing

41:00.459 --> 41:03.830
and as I stepped into it,
the melody was no more.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.498
As I turned to leave,
my foot struck an object

41:08.500 --> 41:09.836
protruding from the earth.

41:11.004 --> 41:12.670
I would not have
remarked upon it,

41:12.672 --> 41:15.973
but for it made a
singular metallic sound.

41:15.975 --> 41:19.978
Clearing away leaves and other
detritus, I soon concluded

41:19.980 --> 41:22.314
I had stumbled upon
something quite striking.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.583
I toiled to free the
item from the earth

41:25.585 --> 41:28.052
which held it in
a vice-like grip.

41:28.054 --> 41:31.823
Having only my bare hands and
sticks, such as I could find,

41:31.825 --> 41:34.294
it took me some time
to lever the item free.

41:35.428 --> 41:37.731
It was nothing less
than part of a cauldron.

41:39.734 --> 41:42.201
Returning to the
house with my trophy,

41:42.203 --> 41:44.603
I set about scraping
the soil and grime

41:44.605 --> 41:45.705
of centuries from it.

41:46.906 --> 41:48.906
The item was bronze
and of ancient origin

41:48.908 --> 41:50.844
covered with Brythonic writings.

41:52.079 --> 41:53.611
Over the next few weeks,

41:53.613 --> 41:55.983
I set about translating
them as far as I was able.

41:57.151 --> 41:59.350
The cauldron was no
household cooking pot

41:59.352 --> 42:02.490
but a religious item, used
in a ceremony of rebirth.

42:03.891 --> 42:06.125
The story revealed by
the antiquated text

42:06.127 --> 42:09.228
was that of a dread
queen slain in battle

42:09.230 --> 42:10.461
who was placed in the cauldron

42:10.463 --> 42:12.931
along with the blood
of her enemies.

42:12.933 --> 42:15.669
Through its magical
power, she rose again.

42:17.138 --> 42:20.172
The name of this queen is
lost, as at a later date,

42:20.174 --> 42:22.641
someone had been at
pains to grind her name

42:22.643 --> 42:24.246
and likeness from the cauldron.

42:25.579 --> 42:29.448
In an act of further vandalism,
the Latin word profanum,

42:29.450 --> 42:32.621
or unholy, had been etched
into the sides of the vessel.

42:33.821 --> 42:35.821
Other words too, but
as they crossed into

42:35.823 --> 42:38.659
the missing portion, I was
unable to decipher them.

42:39.827 --> 42:41.360
At the time I took
this to be the work

42:41.362 --> 42:45.265
of some dull mechanical,
afraid of his own shadow.

42:45.267 --> 42:49.070
But as the days passed,
I too began to fear.

42:51.606 --> 42:55.241
At first, I was plagued
by restless fevered nights

42:55.243 --> 42:58.211
in that cholerical space
between sleep and waking,

42:58.213 --> 43:00.546
I often fancied I could
hear that same melody

43:00.548 --> 43:04.851
as I heard in Jacob's Wood
floating throughout the house.

43:04.853 --> 43:07.287
Several times I rose from my
bed and searched the house

43:07.289 --> 43:09.622
in an effort to
locate its source.

43:09.624 --> 43:12.058
Always without success.

43:12.060 --> 43:15.095
Until one such night,
I left my bedchamber

43:15.097 --> 43:17.564
and walked along
the long gallery.

43:17.566 --> 43:20.000
Around which, in
swimming, grainy darkness,

43:20.002 --> 43:23.672
a thousand fanciful fiends
danced in my fevered imagination.

43:25.140 --> 43:28.143
I stopped, determined to put
such thoughts from my mind.

43:29.578 --> 43:33.147
It was at that point, the
figure of a deathly pale woman

43:33.149 --> 43:35.149
appeared in front of me.

43:35.151 --> 43:38.285
I stared at her bleached,
cavernite face etched

43:38.287 --> 43:41.423
with a hunger deeper than just
a need for mere sustenance.

43:42.525 --> 43:44.827
Then, in an instant,
she was gone.

43:46.761 --> 43:48.895
By morning, I was
convinced my encounter

43:48.897 --> 43:51.631
with the awful woman was the
product of a fevered mind

43:51.633 --> 43:53.668
and attempted to put
it from my thoughts.

43:55.370 --> 43:57.872
But several days later
I was at the piano

43:57.874 --> 44:01.008
and without realising it,
I found myself playing

44:01.010 --> 44:02.743
the eldish melody
I'd first heard

44:02.745 --> 44:04.447
floating on the
wind in the woods.

44:07.084 --> 44:10.552
As I looked up from
the keys I saw again.

44:12.221 --> 44:13.789
I was startled and turned away.

44:15.191 --> 44:17.960
But when I looked up again,
the apparition was gone.

44:19.695 --> 44:22.129
I know that I can no
longer stay in this house.

44:22.131 --> 44:24.732
I am resolved to
depart forthwith.

44:24.734 --> 44:26.834
I leave this account
of the occurrences here

44:26.836 --> 44:28.904
along with the musical
notation of the melody

44:28.906 --> 44:31.039
that accompanies the
spectre as a warning

44:31.041 --> 44:32.609
to all those who come after me.

44:33.609 --> 44:35.342
God save us all.

44:42.485 --> 44:45.155
(OMINOUS MUSIC)

44:52.829 --> 44:55.264
KARL: Well, you
are making progress.

44:55.266 --> 44:57.132
Yes, it's out
of the ground now

44:57.134 --> 45:00.035
and I've made a preliminary
examination of the piece.

45:00.037 --> 45:01.171
Is it as I thought?

45:02.339 --> 45:04.005
The missing half of
the Stearne Cauldron?

45:04.007 --> 45:06.841
Well, I have to say the
prospects are looking positive,

45:06.843 --> 45:08.209
it all seems to check out.

45:08.211 --> 45:10.379
But the only way to
know for sure is for me

45:10.381 --> 45:12.248
to take it back to the
university and match up...

45:12.250 --> 45:13.782
Oh no, no, no.

45:13.784 --> 45:15.483
We can't let you do that.

45:15.485 --> 45:17.119
It stays here.

you want us to verify...

Possession is nine
tenths of the law.

45:22.192 --> 45:24.426
If I let you take it away,
I might never see it again.

45:24.428 --> 45:27.028
You might keep it for your
collection, I know you want it.

45:27.030 --> 45:29.631
But others, may pay more for it.

45:29.633 --> 45:31.167
Really, that's not...

45:31.169 --> 45:33.501
If it's so important that
you verify it with your half

45:33.503 --> 45:35.470
then have it sent here.

45:35.472 --> 45:38.540
You can look at it, satisfy
yourself it's the real thing.

45:38.542 --> 45:40.710
Then we can talk money.

45:40.712 --> 45:43.512
But until you, or somebody
else pays me for it,

45:43.514 --> 45:46.182
it's not leaving this house.

Well, this hasn't
happened before.

else pays me for it,

leave this property.

down to the pub again?

46:30.329 --> 46:31.663
No, to make a phone call.

46:33.064 --> 46:36.000
I'm sorry I left early,
I heard what happened.

46:37.068 --> 46:39.269

46:39.271 --> 46:41.570
Didn't expect that of Tom.

You know who that lad is?

46:43.409 --> 46:44.875
Yeah.

46:44.877 --> 46:46.009
Remember I told you about
the previous gardener

46:46.011 --> 46:48.247
died in that weird accident.

46:49.148 --> 46:50.315
That was Tom's dad.

46:51.617 --> 46:53.451
That's why he was
looking at us like that.

46:53.453 --> 46:54.885
Well you can imagine,

46:54.887 --> 46:57.287
whole episode really
messed him up pretty well.

46:57.289 --> 47:00.723
Of course I'm not his favourite
person, I took his dad's job.

47:00.725 --> 47:02.591
And he's always had it
in for Karl, blames him

47:02.593 --> 47:06.063
for his dad's death because
it happened on Karl's land.

47:06.065 --> 47:07.330
ISABELLE: I see.

47:07.332 --> 47:09.066
I thought there was
some history there.

47:09.068 --> 47:10.535
Oh yeah.

47:10.537 --> 47:12.969
Tom will tell anyone who
listens that Karl's to blame

47:12.971 --> 47:14.207
for his dad's death.

47:15.542 --> 47:17.075
By now you must have realised
you don't want to get

47:17.077 --> 47:18.575
on the wrong side of Karl.

47:18.577 --> 47:19.779
Yes, I gathered that.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.580
He can be quite...

47:23.582 --> 47:24.417
Forceful.

with lots of rooms.

places, just like here.

look, because she was brave,

something out there.

it to you earlier.

It's a journal entry from

Of course, I will.

and he instantly got annoyed.
