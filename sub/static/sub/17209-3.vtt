WEBVTT

00:04.182 --> 00:05.080
Look at him.

00:05.081 --> 00:07.520
So engaged in his
electronic television game.

00:07.521 --> 00:08.987
More like obsessed.

00:08.988 --> 00:11.623
He needs to stop for five
minutes and clean up his room.

00:11.624 --> 00:15.460
Which one of us do you
think they're talking about?

00:15.461 --> 00:17.229
My room's clean.

00:17.230 --> 00:18.730
Gotta be you.

00:18.731 --> 00:21.466
Honestly, I don't know what
you two see in that game.

00:21.467 --> 00:23.569
"That game" is Chimpocalypse,

00:23.570 --> 00:25.804
the most popular video game in America.

00:25.805 --> 00:28.807
And hamburger sandwiches
are the most popular food.

00:28.808 --> 00:30.708
Doesn't make them good.

00:31.710 --> 00:33.946
Okay, Evan, time to do your homework.

00:33.947 --> 00:35.080
Aw, man.

00:35.081 --> 00:36.864
Oscar, you need to get
cleaned up for dinner.

00:36.865 --> 00:38.030
Aw, man.

00:39.084 --> 00:40.319
Thank you.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.521
I know you and Evan got
off to a rocky start,

00:42.522 --> 00:45.023
I really appreciate how hard
you've worked to win him over.

00:45.024 --> 00:47.292
The key is putting myself
in the mind of a child.

00:47.293 --> 00:49.794
Well, feel free to
come back out any time.

00:51.797 --> 00:54.233
All right, I want a
re-match, buddy, tomorrow.

00:54.234 --> 00:55.900
It's your money.

00:59.204 --> 01:00.872
Hey, Charlotte! Cute top.

01:00.873 --> 01:04.042
Thanks, Teddy.

01:04.043 --> 01:06.811
Women love to hear about their shirts.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.782
Hey, you guys mind if I brought
Andre over here for Halloween?

01:10.783 --> 01:12.818
He heard this building is
great for trick-or-treating.

01:12.819 --> 01:14.899
Of course. Although I'm not
sure where he heard that,

01:14.900 --> 01:16.363
we hardly get any trick-or-treaters.

01:16.364 --> 01:17.322
Well, we used to.

01:17.323 --> 01:19.625
Then Felix moved in, and
instead of giving them candy,

01:19.626 --> 01:21.792
he gave out dental floss.

01:22.562 --> 01:24.830
Are you saying that children
are avoiding our apartment?

01:24.831 --> 01:25.831
No.

01:25.832 --> 01:27.231
They're avoiding you.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.968
Evan told me they all
call you Count Plaque-ula.

01:31.937 --> 01:33.605
Count Plaque-ula.

01:33.606 --> 01:36.275
Kids are mean and funny.

01:36.276 --> 01:37.676
Laugh all you want,

01:37.677 --> 01:39.244
but gingivitis doesn't take a holiday.

01:39.245 --> 01:41.388
A little fact that Big Candy
doesn't want you to know.

01:41.389 --> 01:43.348
Felix, come on.

01:43.349 --> 01:44.983
Halloween is the one night of the year

01:44.984 --> 01:47.019
you get to go crazy and be a kid.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.287
Is it?

01:48.288 --> 01:50.389
Or is it just a celebration
of irresponsibility?

01:50.390 --> 01:53.424
"Let's get hopped up on
sugar and mock the dead!"

01:55.160 --> 01:57.229
You got pushed down a
lot as a kid, didn't you?

01:57.230 --> 01:58.530
Face it, Felix,

01:58.531 --> 02:00.299
Halloween isn't the problem... you are.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.334
You just don't know how to cut loose.

02:02.335 --> 02:04.202
Can't cut loose? I?

02:04.203 --> 02:07.639
The guy who plays "La
Vida Loca" on the cello?

02:07.640 --> 02:11.076
I feel like pushing him down right now.

02:11.077 --> 02:12.244
Are you actually saying

02:12.245 --> 02:13.912
that I lack a childlike
sense of abandon?

02:13.913 --> 02:15.314
You were never a child.

02:15.315 --> 02:18.750
When you came out of the
womb, you hung up the placenta.

02:18.751 --> 02:20.385
Well, I'm not going

02:20.386 --> 02:23.055
to apologize for being a mature adult.

02:23.056 --> 02:24.956
As the poet William
Butler Yeats famously said,

02:24.957 --> 02:25.991
"It is so many years..."

02:25.992 --> 02:28.159
Oh, you going down right now!

02:31.196 --> 02:32.831
Damn, you're like a statue!

02:32.832 --> 02:34.331
Pilates.

02:35.572 --> 02:39.033
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:41.106 --> 02:42.842
I don't believe it.

02:42.843 --> 02:44.376
Where'd that come from?

02:44.377 --> 02:46.480
I hung it while you were
at work, I hope you like it.

02:46.481 --> 02:49.315
Aw, I love a Halloween decoration!

02:51.750 --> 02:53.584
Or every one ever made.

02:54.887 --> 02:56.188
Oh, is it too much?

02:56.189 --> 02:58.457
Oh, I'm sorry. You've
already been so nice

02:58.458 --> 03:00.726
by letting me crash here
while I find a new apartment.

03:00.727 --> 03:02.361
No, no, no, it's the perfect setting

03:02.362 --> 03:03.660
for our scary movie marathon.

03:03.661 --> 03:04.995
Ooh, I can't wait!

03:04.996 --> 03:07.498
But you know what, I've got to warn you,

03:07.499 --> 03:09.399
when I get scared I have to pee,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.601
so we're going to be
working that pause button.

03:12.603 --> 03:13.770
Hello.

03:13.771 --> 03:18.308
Oh, what a festive
display of fire hazards.

03:18.309 --> 03:20.332
Oh that's right, Halloween
isn't really your thing.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.611
No, never has been.

03:21.612 --> 03:23.513
I remember the last time
I tried to participate.

03:23.514 --> 03:24.982
I was seven and dressed

03:24.983 --> 03:27.116
as Nobel-Prize-winning
scientist Marie Curie.

03:28.185 --> 03:30.686
Had to take off my pumps
to escape the bullies.

03:31.855 --> 03:33.790
Oh, sweetie.

03:33.791 --> 03:36.727
Why are you not trying
to repress that memory?

03:36.728 --> 03:40.297
Well, Oscar pointed out
that apparently I lack

03:40.298 --> 03:43.166
a sense of childlike whimsy.

03:43.167 --> 03:44.868
Since when do you
care what Oscar thinks?

03:44.869 --> 03:47.237
Since when does Oscar
use the word "whimsy?"

03:47.238 --> 03:49.272
Well, it's not just Oscar.

03:49.273 --> 03:51.575
I was upset to learn that
the children of the building

03:51.576 --> 03:53.759
seem to agree. I guess it's
because I don't know how to

03:53.760 --> 03:56.046
"cut loose" or "go crazy."

03:56.047 --> 03:58.849
Those air quotes aren't
doing you any favors.

03:58.850 --> 04:01.184
Well, this year I plan to embrace

04:01.185 --> 04:02.853
the spirit of the season,

04:02.854 --> 04:04.588
by planning a good, old fashioned,

04:04.589 --> 04:06.490
night of irresponsible fun.

04:06.491 --> 04:09.091
How about you just put
your hands in your pockets?

04:10.127 --> 04:12.062
Good for you. What do you have in mind?

04:12.063 --> 04:13.397
Well, as you know,

04:13.398 --> 04:15.732
every Halloween there is
a kids' party in the lobby.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.733
But this year, as board president,

04:17.735 --> 04:20.370
I plan to introduce a haunted history

04:20.370 --> 04:21.571
tour of the building.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.073
And I'm here because

04:23.074 --> 04:26.510
I need some spooky helpers.

04:26.511 --> 04:27.944
We actually have plans.

04:27.945 --> 04:30.547
Yeah, we're going to eat
popcorn, watch scary movies,

04:30.548 --> 04:32.781
and not pee on the couch.

04:34.117 --> 04:35.751
But you could do that any night!

04:36.153 --> 04:37.154
Please?

04:37.155 --> 04:38.789
It would really mean a lot to me.

04:38.790 --> 04:41.925
Aw, who could say no to this face?

04:41.926 --> 04:42.925
I could.

04:44.494 --> 04:46.229
But I won't.

04:46.230 --> 04:47.253
But I could.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.266
Well, fantastic!

04:49.267 --> 04:51.168
I will get you a draft of the script

04:51.169 --> 04:52.512
so that you can start memorizing.

04:52.513 --> 04:53.679
Oh god! Oh no!

04:54.738 --> 04:56.678
Oh, I love Halloween,
so much fun, so much fun.

04:57.808 --> 04:59.141
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:00.477 --> 05:02.245
Oh, cool chimpbot costume!

05:02.246 --> 05:04.581
I wish they made those in adult sizes.

05:04.582 --> 05:05.982
Maybe they do.

05:05.983 --> 05:08.150
No, I already checked.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.523
You are gonna clean
up on candy tomorrow.

05:13.524 --> 05:15.125
Not here I'm not.

05:15.126 --> 05:16.793
I have to work tomorrow night,

05:16.794 --> 05:17.794
so Evan's going

05:17.795 --> 05:19.496
to my sister's in Long Island.

05:19.497 --> 05:22.799
Or he could stay here and
go trick-or-treating with me.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.601
That's what I said!

05:24.602 --> 05:27.403
But then my mom just laughed
for, like, a really long time.

05:28.438 --> 05:31.675
I didn't laugh... that long.

05:31.676 --> 05:35.011
What's so funny about
me taking care of Evan?

05:35.012 --> 05:37.747
Nothing.

05:37.748 --> 05:40.016
It's just my sister
hasn't seen him in a while,

05:40.017 --> 05:41.384
they'll have a great time.

05:41.385 --> 05:43.386
She's super responsible.

05:43.387 --> 05:45.754
Ha! And I'm not?

05:46.923 --> 05:49.258
Uh-oh, she's going to laugh again.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.895
No, Oscar.

05:51.896 --> 05:54.131
It's just I like Evan a whole lot,

05:54.132 --> 05:56.399
and I'd like to keep him...

05:56.400 --> 05:58.568
Well, I'd like to keep him.

05:58.569 --> 05:59.703
I can do this.

05:59.704 --> 06:01.071
We won't leave the building,

06:01.072 --> 06:04.474
I'll never take my eyes off
of him and you can trust me.

06:04.475 --> 06:06.243
You trust me, right?

06:06.244 --> 06:07.644
Okay.

06:07.645 --> 06:09.179
Let's give it a try.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.647
Awesome!

06:10.648 --> 06:12.348
We're gonna have a great time!

06:15.819 --> 06:18.187
And be very responsible.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:28.973 --> 06:30.448
Who are you?

06:30.449 --> 06:32.950
Mozart van Beethoven?

06:34.251 --> 06:36.391
Our educational system
really failed you, didn't it?

06:37.354 --> 06:38.863
This is my costume

06:38.864 --> 06:40.198
for tonight's terrifying trek

06:40.199 --> 06:42.534
through our building's haunted past.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.502
Oh great, do you mind
if Evan and I tag along?

06:44.503 --> 06:45.570
I would love that!

06:45.571 --> 06:47.171
I just didn't think you were interested.

06:47.195 --> 06:49.028
Oh, I'm not.

06:50.109 --> 06:52.310
But if I want to have any
kind of future with Charlotte,

06:52.311 --> 06:54.345
I need to prove to her that I'm mature.

06:54.346 --> 06:55.647
So I'm going to spend Halloween

06:55.648 --> 06:57.115
with the most mature guy I know.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.783
Well, thank you, Oscar.

06:58.784 --> 07:02.419
And when I say mature, I mean boring.

07:04.055 --> 07:05.356
Oh, you might be surprised.

07:05.357 --> 07:08.191
This tour is going
to be "spook-tacular."

07:09.928 --> 07:11.528
"Abso-boo-tly" frightening.

07:12.764 --> 07:13.765
For all the...

07:13.766 --> 07:16.833
ghouls.

07:17.902 --> 07:20.470
It's exhausting being you, isn't it?

07:21.639 --> 07:23.408
It's not easy.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.844
Hey Oscar, go long!

07:25.845 --> 07:26.845
Hey!

07:28.914 --> 07:30.381
Nice catch!

07:30.382 --> 07:31.382
Thanks.

07:31.383 --> 07:33.317
Wish I was wearing a cup.

07:34.886 --> 07:36.921
Teddy, what's with the suitcase?

07:36.922 --> 07:38.256
Oh, it's Andre's.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.520
His second costume is in there.

07:39.521 --> 07:42.093
I hit all the apartments
in this costume,

07:42.094 --> 07:43.595
then I change for round two.

07:43.596 --> 07:44.863
Very clever.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.630
It's not my first Halloween.

07:48.066 --> 07:49.889
If he was this focused
on sports or education,

07:49.890 --> 07:51.269
he'd be unstoppable.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.004
Can you imagine?

07:55.273 --> 07:57.208
Well, I'm off. See ya, Dad.

07:57.209 --> 07:59.277
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

07:59.278 --> 08:01.779
No offense, but you slow me down.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.214
Too much chit-chat,

08:03.215 --> 08:04.548
not enough Kit Kat.

08:05.316 --> 08:06.499
Now who's this cute little...

08:06.500 --> 08:08.666
No time!

08:11.155 --> 08:12.523
All right, I'm ready to go, Oscar.

08:12.524 --> 08:13.591
Great!

08:13.592 --> 08:14.626
I'll be home by 10:00.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.427
Be responsible, follow the rules.

08:16.428 --> 08:17.428
I will.

08:17.429 --> 08:18.463
I was talking to Oscar.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.198
I will.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.633
We're going to have so much fun.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.134
Well, don't have too much fun.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.236
We'll be with Felix.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.173
Well, have some fun.

08:29.174 --> 08:30.407
Okay.

08:31.609 --> 08:33.311
Good evening.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.614
Our Haunted History tour will
begin when the clock strikes...

08:36.615 --> 08:38.782
6:45.

08:40.585 --> 08:43.354
Doing this for Charlotte,
doing this for Charlotte...

08:43.355 --> 08:45.323
Oscar, it's funny.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.467
Tonight you are attempting
to act like a mature adult,

08:47.468 --> 08:49.427
while I'm endeavoring
to access my inner child.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.530
Oh, he's probably just in there dusting.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.232
Hello, Felix.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.334
This is my son Simon.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.102
No, I'm Albert Einstein.

08:58.103 --> 08:59.103
Of course you are.

08:59.104 --> 09:01.205
And you can meet us back here in an hour

09:01.206 --> 09:03.908
because the tour is
"relativit-ly" short.

09:03.909 --> 09:06.844
Good one.

09:06.845 --> 09:08.646
I have a backpack of supplies.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.381
Breath spray, wet wipes,

09:10.382 --> 09:12.483
and a drone if we need to send for help.

09:12.484 --> 09:15.652
Oh, my god, there's two of them?

09:17.088 --> 09:19.023
Oscar, can we go up to the roof?

09:19.024 --> 09:21.367
All my friends are gonna sneak
up and throw water balloons!

09:21.368 --> 09:22.860
That's an awesome idea!

09:22.861 --> 09:25.096
Is what a bad adult would say...

09:25.097 --> 09:27.831
to an awesome idea
that I can't let you do.

09:32.805 --> 09:37.542
Oh hello, I am Ebenezer Strotham.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.844
You may not know me,
but you do know my work.

09:39.845 --> 09:42.012
You're standing in it.

09:44.582 --> 09:46.484
The building.

09:46.485 --> 09:47.885
I designed the building.

09:47.886 --> 09:51.556
In 1905, it was the site
of a mysterious death.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.359
Robert Coleman's heart gave out
in his seventh-floor apartment.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.863
Authorities called it natural causes,

09:58.864 --> 10:01.031
but some called it...

10:02.967 --> 10:04.202
...murder!

10:06.972 --> 10:08.235
How long is this going to take?

10:08.236 --> 10:09.340
About an hour.

10:09.341 --> 10:11.576
But it'll feel like forever.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.478
That's relativity!

10:13.479 --> 10:15.613
Hold your fire.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.015
So join me now

10:17.016 --> 10:18.416
for an evening of mystery,

10:18.417 --> 10:20.518
but, most of all, fun.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.520
Not a toy!

10:22.521 --> 10:24.654
Not a toy!

10:28.993 --> 10:31.295
Now, Robert Coleman didn't
die in that stairwell.

10:31.296 --> 10:33.531
But he could have,
because safety railings

10:33.532 --> 10:35.700
weren't required by
New York state until...

10:35.701 --> 10:37.868
...1937.

10:39.037 --> 10:42.073
So how did they navigate the stairs?

10:42.074 --> 10:44.040
They walked, Einstein.

10:44.876 --> 10:46.944
What? He's Einstein.

10:46.945 --> 10:48.346
Join me as we enter

10:48.347 --> 10:51.682
the apartment where Coleman
lived with his kindly nurse.

10:51.683 --> 10:53.083
Lived...

10:54.252 --> 10:56.419
...and died!

10:58.456 --> 11:00.258
Come on, come on, come on.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.425
Go, go, go, go, go.

11:06.697 --> 11:10.468
Who dares disturb our slumber?

11:10.469 --> 11:11.669
You want some slumber,

11:11.670 --> 11:14.504
why don't you join our tour?

11:15.406 --> 11:17.041
You're not a guy,

11:17.042 --> 11:19.444
you're the lady who keeps
trying to sell my mom jewelry.

11:19.445 --> 11:25.048
Tell her that all the seasonal
bracelets are half price.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.327
Stay on script.

11:27.328 --> 11:30.455
I roam the halls

11:30.456 --> 11:33.357
looking for a young, healthy heart

11:33.358 --> 11:38.228
because mine was taken from
me on a night most foul.

11:40.465 --> 11:44.001
Might I be the murderer?

11:44.002 --> 11:46.104
Who's the hooker?

11:46.105 --> 11:48.905
Watch your mouth, 4B. I know your mama.

11:49.801 --> 11:51.184
Dani, I didn't tell you

11:51.185 --> 11:52.410
to buy a sexy nurse outfit.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.078
I just bought a nurse's outfit.

11:54.079 --> 11:55.645
I put the sexy in it.

11:57.215 --> 11:59.650
Well, kids, it's still
pretty scary, isn't it?

11:59.651 --> 12:01.385
Please, this is nothing.

12:01.386 --> 12:02.854
Did you ever see Saw?

12:02.855 --> 12:04.322
See saw?

12:04.323 --> 12:07.425
Oh no, if those things aren't
balanced it's like a catapult.

12:07.426 --> 12:08.793
Can we go now?

12:08.794 --> 12:10.027
Yes, because there are

12:10.028 --> 12:12.630
17 clues hidden throughout the building

12:12.631 --> 12:15.999
that will help solve the mystery.

12:17.301 --> 12:20.738
Did she say 17?

12:20.739 --> 12:21.973
I wasn't listening.

12:21.974 --> 12:23.139
Yeah, me neither.

12:24.108 --> 12:26.144
And that's why in mid-1990s

12:26.145 --> 12:28.679
they replaced every
carpet in the building.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.448
Remember, children:

12:30.449 --> 12:32.616
mold is the silent killer.

12:33.784 --> 12:36.721
Excuse me, my mom just texted me.

12:36.722 --> 12:37.955
I have to go.

12:37.956 --> 12:40.725
Yeah, his mom said I have to go, too.

12:40.726 --> 12:41.893
Yeah, you know, me too.

12:41.894 --> 12:42.894
Hey, wait!

12:42.895 --> 12:44.028
Come on, Oscar!

12:44.029 --> 12:45.696
You promised that we
would have some fun.

12:45.697 --> 12:47.532
We will. I'll talk to Felix.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.167
Felix?

12:49.168 --> 12:50.968
Felix?

12:50.969 --> 12:51.969
Ebenezer?

12:51.970 --> 12:53.337
Yes?

12:53.338 --> 12:55.642
We gotta speed things along.
These kids are getting bored.

12:55.643 --> 12:56.241
Bored?

12:56.242 --> 12:58.910
Or entertained into silence?

12:58.911 --> 13:01.379
It's Halloween, all we want is candy!

13:01.380 --> 13:02.680
I mean all they want is candy.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.015
And they're going to get it.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.316
The 17th clue is the combination

13:05.317 --> 13:07.084
that unlocks this
briefcase full of candy.

13:07.085 --> 13:08.653
You've been holding out on us?!

13:08.654 --> 13:09.820
- Give it!
- No, no.

13:09.821 --> 13:11.355
- Give it!
- No.

13:11.356 --> 13:12.390
Man, those Pilates

13:12.391 --> 13:13.558
are really paying off.

13:13.559 --> 13:14.759
Thank you, thank you very much.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.081
But you're not getting the candy!

13:16.082 --> 13:17.945
Stop being so immature.
You stop being so lame!

13:17.946 --> 13:19.497
We're going to lose these kids!

13:19.498 --> 13:22.033
Oh crap, I've already lost one!

13:22.034 --> 13:22.934
Evan! Evan!

13:22.935 --> 13:25.036
Evan!

13:25.037 --> 13:27.205
Have you seen a chimpbot?

13:27.206 --> 13:29.340
I'm a T Rex!

13:29.341 --> 13:31.508
Do you know how questions work?

13:33.878 --> 13:35.146
There you are, buddy.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.914
Listen, we gotta stick together.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.783
Let's go back to my
apartment and regroup.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.685
We've got a ton of candy over there.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.686
There's a chimpbot.

13:43.754 --> 13:45.188
There's a reason you're extinct.

13:46.224 --> 13:48.626
Candy is right there, help yourself.

13:48.627 --> 13:49.760
Evan ditched me.

13:49.761 --> 13:51.229
I thought I lost him for a second.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.396
That would have been bad.

13:52.397 --> 13:53.864
He's Charlotte's only kid.

13:55.767 --> 13:56.767
You're not Evan!

13:56.768 --> 13:58.569
Why are you in his costume?

13:58.570 --> 14:00.004
This is my back-up.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.473
Why didn't you tell me when
I kept calling you Evan!

14:02.474 --> 14:04.254
You promised me candy
and I rolled with it.

14:06.577 --> 14:09.146
Teddy, stop drinking alone
and help me find Evan!

14:09.147 --> 14:10.648
I'm going to start in the lobby.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.017
I'll start at the
penthouse and work down.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.385
I'll just hang back here.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.254
My dogs are barking.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.554
Oh, great.

14:26.182 --> 14:28.749
Well, it's just us.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.868
I suppose we ought to call it a night.

14:31.869 --> 14:33.536
Really?

14:33.537 --> 14:36.773
But I have to know... was it murder?

14:36.774 --> 14:39.641
No, it was complications of an STD.

14:41.378 --> 14:45.147
Which stands for "Super
Terrifying Disease."

14:46.476 --> 14:47.796
Now that I've spoiled the ending,

14:47.797 --> 14:49.980
I suppose there's no reason
to do the rest of the tour.

14:49.981 --> 14:51.655
Where the hell are they?!

14:51.656 --> 14:53.456
We're clue number seven!

14:53.457 --> 14:54.840
They should have been here by now.

14:54.841 --> 14:56.059
They better hurry up.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.395
This place is creepy,
and the radiator steam

14:58.396 --> 15:00.562
is making my damn nails pop off.

15:01.898 --> 15:04.401
Well I suppose you deserve a reward

15:04.402 --> 15:06.101
for staying as long as you did.

15:08.772 --> 15:10.939
Do you have anything healthy?

15:15.679 --> 15:17.713
Granny Smith. Jackpot!

15:22.445 --> 15:24.028
I'm sorry that I ruined your Halloween.

15:24.029 --> 15:25.755
That's okay.

15:25.756 --> 15:27.257
I don't like Halloween.

15:27.258 --> 15:28.692
I can't wait to be an adult

15:28.693 --> 15:30.560
so I don't have to
do this stuff anymore.

15:30.561 --> 15:34.764
You know, I suppose I felt that
way too when I was your age.

15:34.765 --> 15:37.734
But now I feel like I
missed out on something.

15:37.735 --> 15:41.904
I see people cutting loose,
and being mischievous...

15:43.973 --> 15:46.876
I wish I had learned how to do that.

15:46.877 --> 15:48.078
Yeah?

15:48.079 --> 15:49.611
Yeah.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.415
You have plenty of time to be an adult,

15:52.416 --> 15:55.451
so don't rush through the kid part.

15:58.021 --> 16:00.190
You know, Simon?

16:00.191 --> 16:03.059
Simon?

16:03.060 --> 16:04.226
- Dr. Einstein?
- Yes?

16:09.566 --> 16:11.835
What do you say you and
I have some fun, huh?

16:11.836 --> 16:12.899
Throw caution to the wind!

16:12.900 --> 16:15.066
Not the wind?!

16:16.573 --> 16:17.841
Yes, the wind!

16:17.842 --> 16:19.442
I don't know how to do that.

16:19.443 --> 16:20.744
Neither do I.

16:20.745 --> 16:24.381
But we will brave these
uncharted waters together, hm?

16:24.382 --> 16:25.782
Come on.

16:25.783 --> 16:27.117
Oh wait, wait, wait.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.141
There's a little bit of
food residue on your shirt.

16:29.142 --> 16:30.019
Oh dear.

16:30.020 --> 16:31.788
Boop!

16:31.789 --> 16:33.989
- This might take some time.
- Yeah.

16:35.392 --> 16:37.559
I lost a human, a whole human!

16:41.632 --> 16:43.500
Well that's an ego boost.

16:43.501 --> 16:45.902
I didn't think you'd be home so soon.

16:45.903 --> 16:47.170
I was able to duck out early

16:47.171 --> 16:48.994
so the three of us could
go trick-or-treating.

16:48.995 --> 16:50.740
Oh, you really didn't have to do that.

16:50.741 --> 16:53.209
You really, really didn't have to.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.211
Okay, here's the thing.

16:55.212 --> 16:56.346
Evan...

16:56.347 --> 16:58.348
Is right there!

16:58.349 --> 16:59.416
Yeah, Oscar,

16:59.417 --> 17:00.984
right here where you dropped me off.

17:00.985 --> 17:03.686
I told my mom you did
a great job watching me.

17:03.687 --> 17:05.054
I'm glad it went well.

17:05.055 --> 17:07.257
Yes...

17:07.258 --> 17:10.192
It went well.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.362
I'm going to leave now.

17:12.363 --> 17:14.696
Well, thanks for doing such
a good job watching him.

17:14.698 --> 17:16.633
I didn't do a good job watching him.

17:16.634 --> 17:18.101
He ran away!

17:18.102 --> 17:19.435
What?!

17:19.436 --> 17:21.905
I've been looking all
over the building for you!

17:21.906 --> 17:23.373
You scared the hell out of me!

17:23.374 --> 17:25.840
Look, I'm sweating even more than usual!

17:27.109 --> 17:28.778
Is this true, Evan?

17:28.779 --> 17:30.879
He is pretty sweaty.

17:32.782 --> 17:34.050
Sorry.

17:34.051 --> 17:35.351
He wasn't any fun.

17:35.352 --> 17:37.287
Oh, I was no fun?

17:37.288 --> 17:40.790
You want to see me being no fun?

17:40.791 --> 17:42.991
How about no food for a month?

17:45.328 --> 17:47.297
Might be a little much.

17:47.298 --> 17:49.132
Yeah, you're right, it's my first time.

17:49.133 --> 17:52.401
No Chimpocalypse for a month.

17:53.069 --> 17:54.304
That sounds fair.

17:54.305 --> 17:55.805
No, it doesn't.

17:55.806 --> 17:58.407
Man, Oscar, you're so mean!

18:05.215 --> 18:06.749
It's not easy, is it?

18:06.750 --> 18:10.220
No, how do you do this
parenting thing 24/7?

18:10.221 --> 18:12.387
Wine helps.

18:13.356 --> 18:14.958
But you know what?

18:14.959 --> 18:16.793
You handled that really well.

18:16.794 --> 18:17.827
You think?

18:17.828 --> 18:18.828
Yes.

18:18.829 --> 18:20.563
Very mature.

18:20.564 --> 18:23.533
And that's quite a sacrifice for you,

18:23.534 --> 18:26.169
no Chimpocalypse for a month?

18:26.170 --> 18:27.203
What?

18:27.204 --> 18:28.304
No, that was for Evan.

18:28.305 --> 18:30.439
He ran away, not me.

18:31.975 --> 18:34.177
I gotta say, Oscar, seeing you step up

18:34.178 --> 18:38.313
like you did there was pretty sexy.

18:45.788 --> 18:47.323
You want that candy don't you?

18:47.324 --> 18:48.557
Yeah, I really do.

18:52.362 --> 18:53.363
There you all are!

18:56.200 --> 18:58.201
You left before the most fun part...

18:58.202 --> 19:01.938
reading material!

19:01.939 --> 19:03.339
You want to talk about scary,

19:03.340 --> 19:04.707
wait 'til you see these

19:04.708 --> 19:06.341
archaic building codes.

19:07.143 --> 19:07.844
What?

19:07.845 --> 19:09.312
What? What is it?

19:10.514 --> 19:12.849
It's the ghost of Robert Coleman!

19:12.850 --> 19:14.284
He's come for

19:14.285 --> 19:16.251
my heart!

19:17.153 --> 19:18.187
Ah!

19:23.793 --> 19:27.630
Respect... your... teachers.

19:34.137 --> 19:35.772
That was awesome!

19:35.773 --> 19:37.407
Yes, it was!

19:37.408 --> 19:39.042
Great work with the drone!

19:39.043 --> 19:41.544
That was exactly the kind
of reckless tomfoolery

19:41.545 --> 19:43.679
that being a kid is all about, huh?

19:47.617 --> 19:50.019
I guess we better get you home, huh?

19:50.020 --> 19:53.188
Why do I get the nagging feeling
that I'm forgetting something?

19:55.191 --> 19:57.526
Please tell me your foot has a tail.

19:59.662 --> 20:01.598
I felt it, too!

20:01.599 --> 20:03.665
- Aw, hell no!
- Oh, my god!

20:12.854 --> 20:14.654
This is the first time
ever having nougat.

20:16.157 --> 20:17.959
Good.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.125
Not great.

20:20.328 --> 20:22.163
All right, here, try
a Three Musketeers bar.

20:22.164 --> 20:24.899
They named a candy bar
after my third-favorite

20:24.900 --> 20:27.067
Alexandre Dumas novel!

20:29.504 --> 20:30.638
No, I probably shouldn't.

20:30.639 --> 20:31.906
I've had so much already.

20:31.907 --> 20:34.041
Oh come on, feed your inner child.

20:34.042 --> 20:35.243
He's had a huge night.

20:35.244 --> 20:37.311
Should we split it?

20:37.312 --> 20:38.695
Unless of course you're too mature

20:38.696 --> 20:40.279
and responsible for candy after dinner.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.182
Who knows?

20:41.183 --> 20:43.483
I may even floss tonight.

20:45.086 --> 20:46.687
Whoo! What a night.

20:46.688 --> 20:48.356
Look at that swagger!

20:48.357 --> 20:50.524
Learned it from me.

20:51.392 --> 20:53.326
Let's get you home, son.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.035
One of you chumps want
to tell me something?
