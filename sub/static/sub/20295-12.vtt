-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.267 --> 00:36.333
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.900
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.933 --> 00:42.267
in a court of law.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.633
-Deputy Jonathan Rogers:
We are essentially the boundary
or the barrier

00:44.667 --> 00:47.033
between the good
and the evil of the citizens
of Escambia County.

00:47.067 --> 00:48.733
We're the frontline defense.

00:48.767 --> 00:51.567
You have to be willin'
at the start of your day,

00:51.600 --> 00:54.367
knowin' that it could be
the day you make
the ultimate sacrifice.

00:54.400 --> 00:59.333
I pray that it never happens,
but when we sign up for this job
that's what we're here to do.

00:59.367 --> 01:03.400
Another deputy just spotted
this car, rolled through
a stop sign,

01:03.433 --> 01:05.533
going through the back way
of Montclair, which is common

01:05.567 --> 01:09.333
for individuals tryin' to
skirt out to the main highway,

01:09.367 --> 01:11.167
which is a known drug area
back in this neighborhood,

01:11.200 --> 01:15.067
We're gonna get out with him
before he can get out
and see what he's got going.

01:17.267 --> 01:18.500
(dog barking)

01:18.533 --> 01:20.567
-(police radio chatters)

01:21.833 --> 01:24.200
How you doin'?
Deputy Rogers,
Sheriff's Office.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.567
Stop sign back there,
you didn't come
to a complete stop.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.433
-All right.
-Got a driver's license on you?

01:31.567 --> 01:33.100
Got any ID on you, sir?

01:33.133 --> 01:35.167
-I'm gettin' it right now.
-Okay.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.167
Is this your car?
-My grandma's car...

01:37.200 --> 01:39.833
Your grandma's car?
Okay. Where y'all headed?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.367
-I'm goin' to pick
my grandma up. I'm just goin'
to pick my grandma up

01:42.400 --> 01:44.967
after this.
-Okay. Anything illegal
in the car?

01:45.067 --> 01:47.267
-No, sir.
-Would you have a problem
if I searched the car?

01:47.300 --> 01:50.433
-The car, uh, oh, go ahead.
-No, it's up to you. I mean...

01:50.467 --> 01:53.067
-(mutters)... No.
-You don't want me to?

01:53.067 --> 01:55.067
Okay, fair enough.
What's your name?

01:55.067 --> 01:58.900
-Me? He got it.
-Okay, I'm askin' your name.

01:58.933 --> 02:02.333
-He got my ID.
-Okay, I just asked
for your name.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.433
-We can go that route, too.
-What route?

02:05.467 --> 02:09.067
-Just got a hit.
Let me get you to step
out of the car? Leave him in.

02:09.067 --> 02:11.633
One at a time.
Step out of the car.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.933
-What am I gettin' out for?
-'Cause I can smell
the odor of marijuana

02:13.967 --> 02:16.300
comin' from the vehicle.
-There's no marijuana
in this vehicle, sir.

02:16.333 --> 02:20.600
-Okay, I can smell it,
so it's either on you--
Turn around.

02:20.633 --> 02:24.833
Step back off the car.
Spread your legs.

02:24.867 --> 02:28.467
Don't... don't move.
You hear me?

02:28.500 --> 02:33.400
Anything? Zero.
Don't let him out.
He's gonna try to get out.

02:33.433 --> 02:35.800
Three-eight, give me traffic,
one more unit.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.667
-Brown: Stay in the car.
-(police radio chatters)

02:38.700 --> 02:40.200
-Put your hands
behind your back.

02:40.233 --> 02:41.300
-Do not reach around.
-Hey!

02:41.333 --> 02:42.767
-Put your hands on the dash!

02:42.800 --> 02:44.400
Put your hands on the dash.

02:44.433 --> 02:47.100
-You understand me?
-Three-eight, have 'em
step it up.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.467
-I'm tellin' you right now,
if you take your hands
off the dash--

02:49.500 --> 02:52.133
-'Cause you got a gun
in your waistband,
your partner's in there

02:52.167 --> 02:56.267
reachin' around.
I'm gonna stay alive today,
do you understand?

02:56.300 --> 02:58.600
-Hey, I'm not even resistin',
why you gotta go so high
with it?

02:58.633 --> 03:01.833
-That way in case you wanna
get silly.

03:01.867 --> 03:04.400
Sir, don't-- it'd be
in your best interests
not to be pullin' your hands

03:04.433 --> 03:06.500
off that dash.
You understand?

03:06.533 --> 03:08.833
Deputy Brown:
I'm tellin' you,
I'm watchin' you.

03:08.867 --> 03:10.833
-Three-eight, one detained.
You got him?

03:10.867 --> 03:13.900
Back up and lay on your face.
Back up and lay on your face.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.767
-I get arrested, too?
-No, you're goin' in custody
until we figure out

03:16.800 --> 03:19.700
what else we got here.
You got anything on you?
-No, sir.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.600
-Pulled a car over
that rolled a stop sign
back here on Clifton.

03:22.633 --> 03:26.300
Um, driver's extremely nervous.
I'm gettin' the smell, odor
of marijuana

03:26.333 --> 03:30.067
comin' from the vehicle.
Pulled the driver out,
and immediately noticed

03:30.100 --> 03:32.433
this tucked in his waistband
in the small of his back.

03:32.467 --> 03:35.600
-(indistinct)
-Turn this way.
What have you got

03:35.633 --> 03:38.833
in your pants?
He's got weed.

03:38.867 --> 03:42.067
-(police radio chatters)

03:43.300 --> 03:44.967
-Due to the quantity
of narcotics,

03:45.067 --> 03:47.367
we'll be seizin' the money.
-I didn't even run no stop sign.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.067
-You did.
-I made a right.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.533
-You ran a stop sign.
-No, I didn't.

03:50.567 --> 03:53.533
-Turn around.
That's the least
of your worries, okay?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.433
I pull you out, you're a little
fidgety, kind of nervous.
-By the way you pulled me

03:56.467 --> 03:59.200
out of the car.
You jacked me up, like...
-You had a gun.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.433
-If I want-- What was I
was gonna do with it?
You seen-- you had--

04:01.467 --> 04:03.067
-I don't know.
I don't know. Listen...

04:03.100 --> 04:05.967
-Did you feel a threat?
Was there a capability?
Was there intent?

04:06.067 --> 04:08.867
-Yeah. You had the ability.
-That's a deadly force triangle,
you know what that is?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.933
-What's that?
-A deadly force triangle,
you know what that is?

04:10.967 --> 04:13.667
-What's a deadly--
-Capability, intent,
opportunity, did I have

04:13.700 --> 04:17.667
any of that?
I had the capability,
but di-- but, but, but

04:17.700 --> 04:20.467
did I intend to?
-I don't know your intentions,
so I can't say you--

04:20.500 --> 04:23.067
whether you did
or you didn't. I have no clue
of your intentions.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.733
Did you know my intentions?
-No, 'cause I ain't do nothin'.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.533
-So, if you don't know mine,
how am I supposed to know yours?

04:29.567 --> 04:32.300
Right?
-I was bein' cooperative.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.167
-But you had a gun
in your waistband.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.600
-For my safety, for real.
-Okay. Mine's for my safety,
but I don't know

04:37.633 --> 04:40.067
your intentions.
So I have to take
all precautions,

04:40.100 --> 04:42.167
to make sure I stay alive.
-All right.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.600
-Agree?
-I agree with that.

04:43.633 --> 04:45.567
-I wanna go home to my family
just like you do, brother.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.733
Okay? Fair enough.
-All right.

04:48.767 --> 04:53.167
-Josh, right?
-I, I, I w-wish I could,
so I could tell y'all,

04:53.200 --> 04:57.400
so he could go to prison
for life. He's-- he killed
my homeboy. Yes, sir, that's me.

04:57.433 --> 04:59.600
-Okay, I didn't see
your glasses. Turn and talk
to me for a second.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.867
You understand your rights, sir,
I read you your rights?
-Yes, sir.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.733
-What's goin' on
with your homeboy?
-I don't know.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.567
-Did you know he had the weed
in the car?

05:05.600 --> 05:09.133
You couldn't smell it?
-I wouldn't know... I, my
nose's stopped up,

05:09.167 --> 05:11.233
I got a-- I just really
gettin' over a cold.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.200
-Okay. What about the gun?

05:13.233 --> 05:15.733
-I didn't know nothin'
about the gun. Like I say,
he just picked me up.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.667
-Okay. Are you
a convicted felon?

05:17.700 --> 05:20.067
-I'm on probation.
-For what?

05:20.067 --> 05:23.067
-For marijuana possession.
-Under or over?

05:23.067 --> 05:24.900
-Over.
-Oh, okay.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.833
So you know bein' in the
presence of all this could...

05:26.867 --> 05:28.567
-Yes, sir, I know.
-...possibly violate...

05:28.600 --> 05:30.767
-That's why I said--
I'm lettin' you know
I didn't know it was there.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.300
-All right, well, sit tight,
and once we get things
sorted out, we'll get you

05:33.333 --> 05:34.433
cut loose.
-All right.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.300
-All right?

05:36.333 --> 05:39.600
Damian, why do you have the gun?
-For safety, too many people

05:39.633 --> 05:42.200
are gettin' killed.
-I can... completely agree
with you on that.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.767
Are you a convicted felon?
-No, I'm not, I'm none of that.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.667
-Where'd you get the gun?
-I bought that.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.867
-And how much
did you pay for it?
-200.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.233
-200?
-Yeah.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.367
-It's a pretty nice gun.
Taurus was a--
was like a PT-111?

05:53.400 --> 05:57.067
-Yeah.
-Pretty nice gun.
Got one myself.

05:57.067 --> 06:00.133
You think $200
is a reasonable price for that?

06:00.167 --> 06:05.100
Knowin' they're probably
more than that?
-I mean...

06:05.133 --> 06:07.900
-Pretty cheap.
-Yeah. I know
they're like 699 for it.

06:07.933 --> 06:11.867
-Yeah, so if somebody
come and offer me
a PT-111 for $200,

06:11.900 --> 06:15.467
and-- like they did you,
what, what was, probably
the first thing

06:15.500 --> 06:17.833
that popped into your head?
Be honest.
-I need it.

06:17.867 --> 06:20.867
-And what?
Probably stolen.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.233
For 200 bucks, it is
what it is.
-Right.

06:23.267 --> 06:24.867
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.433
-It probably crossed
your mind.
-He had a box

06:26.467 --> 06:29.300
and everything with it.
-Okay. Well,
the gun's stolen.

06:29.333 --> 06:33.167
-Is it?
-It is. So, possession
of a stolen firearm

06:33.200 --> 06:36.067
during the commission
of a felony. Marijuana's
a felony amount.

06:36.067 --> 06:38.733
Okay? Were you fixin'
to go get rid
of that weed, or...

06:38.767 --> 06:41.133
-Yeah, I was gonna pick up
my grandma, actually.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.133
-Okay... and then go,
try to make
a couple dollars?

06:43.167 --> 06:46.667
-Right.
-Okay. Well, sit tight for me,
give me just a second.

06:46.700 --> 06:49.067
I'll be right back
over here. All right.

06:49.067 --> 06:52.267
The driver admitted
it was stolen. He said
it's his, and he bought it

06:52.300 --> 06:55.900
for $200. Said he wanted it
for protection.
-Well... around here

06:55.933 --> 06:57.767
you need it, but...
-Yeah. I know,
that being said, he--

06:57.800 --> 06:59.600
-Gotta do it
the right way.
-Yeah, he takes the ride,

06:59.633 --> 07:02.233
and a successful--
stolen gun taken off
the streets.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.067
-I love my job.
I love comin' to work,
I love gettin'

07:07.067 --> 07:09.400
to serve the community
and, and interact
with different people,

07:09.433 --> 07:12.067
and the aspect of never knowing
what's gonna happen next.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.867
But it's definitely nice
when I'm able to go home.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.167
I've got my wife and my kids
there, and I like to spend
a lot of time with them,

07:17.200 --> 07:18.500
and have as much fun
as we can,

07:18.533 --> 07:21.067
and, and leave work at work.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.833
Got a vehicle rollin'
through the neighborhood,

07:22.867 --> 07:25.200
stayin' off
the main streets,
that didn't use its blinker.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.067
We're gonna pull him over
and talk to him
for a second.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.200
(siren)

07:28.233 --> 07:29.967
(indistinct)

07:30.067 --> 07:31.567
451, Code 58.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.067
-(radio) 451, go ahead.
-Maroon Camaro.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.367
-(radio chatter)
-(indistinct)

07:45.367 --> 07:49.300
-Reason I was stoppin' you
is 'cause you didn't
use your blinker back there.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.767
-I just live right here.
-I understand that,
but when the police

07:51.800 --> 07:54.467
start pullin' you over,
you pull over, you don't keep
drivin' home.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.600
Do you have warrants
or somethin'?
-No...

07:56.633 --> 07:59.500
-Is there somethin' goin' on
of why you wouldn't--
why you wouldn't pull over?

07:59.533 --> 08:02.267
-I don't have insurance.
-Okay, well, whether
you pull over here

08:02.300 --> 08:05.500
or pull over there,
you still don't have insurance,
so go ahead and pull over, okay?

08:05.533 --> 08:07.867
All right, let me get
your license and insurance,
okay? Or your license.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.700
-I don't have a license.
-You don't have any kind
of-- do you have any kind

08:10.733 --> 08:13.100
of Texas ID on you?
-I'm fightin' with my--
with my fiancé...

08:13.133 --> 08:14.700
-Is he here?
-Yes.

08:14.733 --> 08:18.067
-Go ahead and step out for me.
Is this car registered
to you, ma'am?

08:18.067 --> 08:20.133
-Yes.
-Okay.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.233
Go ahead and step back here
in front of my car.

08:23.267 --> 08:26.600
-In front of your car.
-Yeah, just right here.

08:28.733 --> 08:30.700
You have anything on you
that I need to know about?

08:30.733 --> 08:32.533
John:
Thank you. We're done.
Are you happy?

08:32.567 --> 08:34.700
-Is this your boyfriend
back here?
-I work at Denny's.

08:34.733 --> 08:37.500
-Hey, sir, go ahead
and wait inside for me, okay?

08:37.533 --> 08:39.767
You don't need to come
over here.
-You got it.

08:39.800 --> 08:44.333
-He's just been really bad,
disrespecting me, and I work
graveyards at Denny's.

08:44.367 --> 08:50.067
-Mm-hm. And tomorrow's
Mother's Day, so I met
my, my daughter, and we were...

08:50.067 --> 08:52.633
we'd already been fighting,
so that's why I left.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.467
He told me to
go get some sleep,

08:54.500 --> 08:56.867
and he started calling me
a stupid bitch.

08:56.900 --> 09:00.200
And he stuck a White Castle
scorching hot hamburger
in my mouth

09:00.233 --> 09:02.133
while I was laying in the bed.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.767
And I told him I didn't want it,

09:03.800 --> 09:05.633
because I had this
cut on my lip.

09:05.667 --> 09:08.167
And he did it anyway,
and he just--

09:08.200 --> 09:09.800
He constantly disagrees with me

09:09.833 --> 09:12.300
and makes me do things
that I don't want to.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.867
So I just--
-So...

09:13.900 --> 09:15.667
what's his issue
with doing stuff like that?

09:15.700 --> 09:17.933
Kind of irrational.
Is he-- Is he on drugs?

09:17.967 --> 09:20.167
-No, he's just been
trying to control me.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.767
-This is your house, correct?
-Yes.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.733
-And you don't have access
to get into the house
if it's locked?

09:23.767 --> 09:25.767
-But I have money,
I could go to a hotel.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.733
-Well, and here's the thing,
we'll get to all that
in a minute.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.800
We would like to talk to him and
make sure of what's going on,

09:30.833 --> 09:32.933
and then go from there.

09:32.967 --> 09:34.633
-(knocking)

09:34.667 --> 09:36.300
-Come open the door,
talk to us.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.467
-We're just wanting to make sure
that all it was was an argument,

09:38.500 --> 09:39.833
but I need to talk to you, too.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.433
-I have warrants out
for my arrest.

09:41.467 --> 09:42.733
You gonna arrest me?

09:42.767 --> 09:44.767
-Okay, well we're gonna
have to get that figured out.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.467
That's a possibility,
but I need to talk to you,

09:46.500 --> 09:48.367
and she needs access
to her house.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.067
-I'll give her access,
but do we have to

09:51.067 --> 09:52.633
be arrested today?

09:52.667 --> 09:54.300
Uh, let me call my boss.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.400
Let me get some bondsman
worked up.

09:56.433 --> 09:57.933
-Okay. Come out here
and talk to us,

09:57.967 --> 09:59.067
and we can figure all that out.

09:59.067 --> 10:01.033
-I got a seatbelt problem.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.900
Thank you, Carrie. Thank you.
-(dog barking)

10:05.667 --> 10:07.700
-Come here.
-Okay. Go ahead
and step out here for us.

10:07.733 --> 10:10.367
-You're not gonna
arrest me like--
-Come out here and talk to us.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.600
-You're not gonna put, like,
handcuffs on me.
-Step out here, John.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.400
-Yes. That's what
arrest is, okay?

10:14.433 --> 10:16.633
-Come here, John.
-I have a dislocated shoulder.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.200
-Okay. That's fine.
-Thank you, Carrie.

10:18.233 --> 10:20.733
-John, step out here for us.

10:20.767 --> 10:22.433
-Thank you, Carrie.
-Sir.

10:22.467 --> 10:24.833
-I didn't do anything.
-We are here to make sure
there are no more disputes,

10:24.867 --> 10:26.400
not to keep having
a further one.

10:26.433 --> 10:27.700
So step out here.

10:27.733 --> 10:29.133
Set that down right here for us.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.567
-Okay.
-Get your hand
out of your pocket,

10:30.600 --> 10:32.667
and step out here.
-Come out here right now.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.400
-Okay--
-You can step out here,
or we're gonna have--

10:34.433 --> 10:35.867
-Carrie: No, babe!

10:35.900 --> 10:37.500
-Come out here.
-Don't hurt me.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.367
-I'm not here to hurt you.
-I got a dislocated shoulder.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.300
-But we need you to listen
and do what you're told. Okay?

10:41.333 --> 10:43.333
-Don't do this one.
-I have to do this one.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.400
I need you to relax,
'cause then that's what will
make it okay.

10:45.433 --> 10:47.800
-Carrie. Carrie. Carrie.
-You're doing this.
You did this.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.200
-Why don't you quit drinking?

10:49.233 --> 10:52.167
Please sleep.
I'm gonna sleep tonight.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.533
I'm glad you're proud.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.633
I'm glad you're proud, girl.
-Hey, hey.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.667
Listen-- Listen to me.
-We're not getting married.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.500
-John, listen to me. Stop.
-You blew it! You blew it!

11:01.533 --> 11:02.800
-Stop. Okay, let's go
to the car.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.133
-Yeah, it's over.
-All the money that I paid...

11:05.167 --> 11:06.800
-It ain't about money, Carrie.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.667
-It is, 'cause I worked
my ass off!

11:08.700 --> 11:10.533
-You can have it all!
We're done!

11:10.567 --> 11:12.167
Thank you!
-Hey, stop!

11:12.200 --> 11:13.633
She didn't call us.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.367
She made a traffic violation
over here,

11:15.400 --> 11:16.600
and I pulled her over,

11:16.633 --> 11:18.367
and she drove the car home
before she pulled over,

11:18.400 --> 11:20.133
because she didn't--
if she was gonna end up...
-Okay.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.567
-for some reason going to jail,
she didn't want the car to
get impounded.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.400
-The last 20 hours,
she's been up.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.667
She works at Denny's at night...
-Right.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.333
-...on the graveyard shift.
-Mm-hmm.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.100
-She comes home,
and she drinks a little bit,

11:30.133 --> 11:33.067
and then she started driving,
and I got upset.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.067
-Okay.
-So I followed her,

11:35.100 --> 11:38.600
got her to the bar,
and she wanted to keep on going.

11:38.633 --> 11:41.633
I asked her, "Let me drive you,"
and she drove.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.633
And I said,
"Just drive to the house."
-(clears throat)

11:43.667 --> 11:46.200
-And she went to the house,
and then she came back,

11:46.233 --> 11:47.767
you guys are out front.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.133
-Well, like I said,
that's just--

11:49.167 --> 11:51.500
-And now you know
as much as I do.
But let me tell you this.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.233
I knew I was gonna
get arrested eventually.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.067
I talked to my boss
just a minute ago.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.200
He's gonna bail me out,
so let's just get this
over with.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.967
-Okay. And like I said,
we're not trying to prolong this
any more than we have to.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.333
-And, no. She got--
She won. You won!

12:02.367 --> 12:04.067
-Hey, that's not
what this is about.
-It's over.

12:04.067 --> 12:06.167
-Stop. She didn't want us here
any more than you did.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
-I don't wanna
look at her anymore.
-Then quit lookin' at her!

12:08.233 --> 12:09.700
-Thanks, Carrie!
-Listen to me, sir.

12:09.733 --> 12:12.067
We're not doing that.
You don't need to talk to her
anymore.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.933
-No, we're done, guys.
-Hey, just listen to me.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.267
-I'm going back to Nebraska!
-That's fine. Sit down.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.567
-(police radio chatter)

12:17.600 --> 12:19.333
-I'm not gonna listen to you
stand out here and yell

12:19.367 --> 12:21.667
and scream at her anymore.
I'm tired of listening to it.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.700
The reason you're going to jail
is because of a warrant

12:23.733 --> 12:25.233
that you got by
not wearing a seatbelt.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.233
So you yelling at her
about her causing this

12:27.267 --> 12:29.267
isn't helping anything,
because she didn't cause this.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.467
-Oh, she just finished it.
-It's just the chance
of the fact that

12:31.500 --> 12:33.867
we ended up here,
and you had a warrant.
-Come on. We're done.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.433
-You're fact is over, man.
You're not gonna
convince me of nothing.

12:36.467 --> 12:38.467
I'm not trying to convince you.
I'm just letting you know

12:38.500 --> 12:40.333
this is on you, not her.
-Then, then, stop.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.800
We're done. It's over.
-So take some responsibility
for what you've done, okay?

12:42.833 --> 12:44.067
-Responsible.
-Yeah.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.800
-Close the door
and we'll be responsible.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.967
-Okay, thank you.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.100
-Carrie, you won!
Are you happy?

12:49.133 --> 12:50.500
-Here's what we've got, okay?
-Is he okay?

12:50.533 --> 12:51.933
-He's fine. He's--

12:51.967 --> 12:54.100
He's upset, and he's trying to
blame everybody but himself

12:54.133 --> 12:56.133
and cause a scene. So...

12:56.167 --> 12:57.267
Here's
what we've got, okay?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.100
Two warnings. One for
not using your signal,

12:59.133 --> 13:01.533
and one for not having your
driver's license on you, okay?

13:01.567 --> 13:02.767
Just hang tight
for me for a second.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.600
Hey, sir?

13:04.633 --> 13:06.233
Stop.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.733
-We having fun yet?

13:08.767 --> 13:10.233
-Yep.
-We'll put this
on your head now.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.067
-You're in a helmet, 'cause
you kept banging your head,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.267
and we can't having you do that.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.333
-This just ruined John's world.
Thanks, Carrie!

13:15.367 --> 13:16.600
-Why are you doing this
to this lady?

13:16.633 --> 13:18.967
-Because she deserves it.
-She doesn't deserve this.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.500
Well, John--
-You're an idiot.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.333
-I'm sorry you feel the way
that you do about all this.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.767
Hope you have
a better night, okay?

13:26.267 --> 13:28.067
-I was headed to work one night
about three years ago

13:28.067 --> 13:29.600
when my daughter
was three years old,

13:29.633 --> 13:31.433
and she gave me
a little stuffed giraffe

13:31.467 --> 13:34.067
and a hair clip that she told me
she wanted me to keep

13:34.100 --> 13:35.867
so that the bad guys
didn't get me.

13:35.900 --> 13:39.100
I keep my giraffe in my bag
and keep my hair clip
in my pocket,

13:39.133 --> 13:40.733
and I've had it
with me ever since.

13:40.767 --> 13:43.933
And that's part of what
keeps you going some nights

13:43.967 --> 13:46.600
whenever the stresses
start getting to you.

13:46.633 --> 13:48.233
-Right now we're trying to
catch up to a vehicle

13:48.267 --> 13:51.700
that has made
a few traffic violations,

13:51.733 --> 13:53.467
and they're driving
a little crazy, so...

13:53.500 --> 13:55.967
we're gonna see
if we can't find out
what's going on with him.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.400
-First and Bryan.

13:57.433 --> 14:01.567
442 We'll be out.
Texas George Young Brian Six

14:01.600 --> 14:04.367
at southwest First and Bryan.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.067
-(radio static)

14:07.767 --> 14:09.900
(radio chatter)

14:13.400 --> 14:15.267
-Hi. How you doing?
-Good. How are you?

14:15.300 --> 14:16.967
-Pretty good.
-(music playing from radio)

14:17.067 --> 14:19.733
-I'm Officer McFarland.
You have your license
and insurance with you?

14:19.767 --> 14:21.333
The reason you're
being pulled over is,

14:21.367 --> 14:22.400
there's a few things.
-Okay.

14:22.433 --> 14:23.667
-You didn't change la--

14:23.700 --> 14:25.333
You didn't use your signal
when you changed lanes.

14:25.367 --> 14:27.267
You kind of rolled the stop sign
as it was turning red,

14:27.300 --> 14:28.933
the light back there.
-That sucks.

14:28.967 --> 14:30.467
-All kinds of stuff.
You in a hurry or what?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.600
-No, sir. Just write my tickets.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.333
I apologize, sincerely.

14:34.367 --> 14:36.100
-Okay. I'm not here to
necessarily write you tickets.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.400
I'm just trying to figure out
if you're in a hurry
or what's going on.

14:38.433 --> 14:40.267
-Oh, no, actually, um,
I mean. You know what, dude?

14:40.300 --> 14:41.467
I'm gonna be honest with you.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.233
I just got out of
a four-year relationship.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.700
-Mm-hmm.
-Um...

14:44.733 --> 14:47.233
I met the girl while I was at
Neal Unit Prison.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.700
I just got out June 26th
of last year.

14:49.733 --> 14:54.067
Um... I didn't--
I didn't, uh...

14:54.067 --> 14:55.833
Man, I took advantage
of this girl.

14:55.867 --> 14:58.433
I didn't-- I didn't
hold her hand in public,
this and that.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.600
And, uh, there's just
so much more to it.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.367
Um, dude,

15:02.400 --> 15:04.767
I don't even know
who I just bought this beer for.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.267
But, like, lately, I'm just
trying to, like,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.133
help out any kind
of person possible,

15:09.167 --> 15:11.533
because I feel wrong
for the things that I've done,

15:11.567 --> 15:13.167
and I just wanna make up for it.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.800
-You must have done her
real bad, man. It's got--

15:14.833 --> 15:17.067
-I really did, because
this girl just let her kids

15:17.067 --> 15:19.533
get, uh, CPS took her kids.
-Mmm.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.667
-Uh, no (bleep), man. Um--
-Okay.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.733
Man, I'm gonna be
honest with you.
I don't have insurance.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.367
If you wanna write me a ticket,
you can.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.933
-Okay.
-I'm actually dropping
this beer off to this woman.

15:28.967 --> 15:30.467
-But you don't know
who you bought it for?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.633
-No, sir. Hey, as sad
as this sounds,

15:32.667 --> 15:34.067
and I might look
like a bitch, dude,

15:34.067 --> 15:35.733
and you might think I'm weak.
-Nah.

15:35.767 --> 15:39.267
-Like, ever since this past
two weeks since I broke up
with this girl,

15:39.300 --> 15:42.067
man, I've been--
Like, I'll stop at a store,

15:42.067 --> 15:44.800
and I'll just look around,
or I'm just looking around
while I'm driving

15:44.833 --> 15:47.367
just to see if anybody needs
some kind of help, dude,

15:47.400 --> 15:50.067
because, like,
I've been selfish, and...

15:50.100 --> 15:51.667
and, uh, man.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.467
-Nothing wrong
with helping people, man.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.667
-And, hey, look, I'm probably,
like, uh,

15:55.700 --> 15:58.067
contributing to this woman's
addiction or whatever,

15:58.067 --> 16:00.300
but I just wanna make up
for things I've paid.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.100
-Is there anything in the car
we need to know about?

16:02.133 --> 16:03.833
-Uh, there's a beer.
-Well, I'm not worried.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.267
It's closed, man.
You already showed me that part.
I'm not worried about that.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.767
-But you can come
search the car.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.567
I'll get out, dude.
I don't have anything to hide.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.300
-Okay. Go ahead and step out
for me, then, if you don't mind
us searching it.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.800
And I'll have you
stand back here with my partner
for just a second, okay?

16:14.833 --> 16:16.567
-That's fine.
-You don't have any warrants
or nothing?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.933
-No, dude.
-Haven't caught any other
charges since you got out?

16:18.967 --> 16:20.733
-No, man, I'm worki--
-Step right back here.

16:20.767 --> 16:22.467
-I'm, like, just trying
to change my life, dude.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.067
-Just stand right here
in front of the car.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.200
If you could put your hands
up on the hood
for just a second, okay?

16:26.233 --> 16:27.700
-You got anything on you?
-No, sir.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.667
-Can I search you?
-Yeah, that's fine, dude.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.733
-You said, "no"
on warrants, huh?
-No, sir.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.533
What were you in for,
if you don't mind me asking?

16:33.567 --> 16:35.333
-Aggravated assault
on a public servant.

16:35.367 --> 16:36.700
-Well, there you go.

16:36.733 --> 16:38.967
-I was young, I was 21.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.467
-Hey, we all make mistakes, bud.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.267
-Hang tight with my partner
for just a second, okay?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.933
You can smoke your cigarette
or whatever.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.267
-So what's the deal
with your girl?

16:45.300 --> 16:46.667
-Oh, she's not my girlfriend.
I mean,

16:46.700 --> 16:48.167
I met her while
I was at Neal Unit.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.700
I was in prison, and we have
a wonderful story.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.100
Because, like, you don't see
nothing like that.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.733
There's so much stuff
I regret with this girl,

16:54.767 --> 16:57.100
but I wasn't the perfect
boyfriend or any of that.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.667
-Have you had
anything to drink today?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.867
-Uh, way earlier this morning,
but I've been asleep.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.333
-Way earlier?
-Yeah.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.867
-Okay.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.467
I can still smell
the alcohol on you.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.667
Did you spill some
on your clothes?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.433
-Um, maybe in the process.
I don't know.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.200
-Oh, okay.
-I've changed clothes

17:11.233 --> 17:13.333
since I drank earlier today.
-Oh, okay.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.367
Have you ever done
a field sobriety test before?
-Yes, sir.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.767
-Okay. Keep your feet together
and your hands by your side.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.667
Just put them by your side,
not behind your back.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.900
and just follow my finger
with your eyes
and your eyes only, okay?

17:21.933 --> 17:23.133
-Yes, sir.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.500
-Perfect. Thank you.
You're good. You can lean back.

17:34.833 --> 17:37.133
-Well, we pulled this guy over
for the way he was driving.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.400
He seemed like he was
in a hurry, or...

17:39.433 --> 17:41.100
just something
didn't seem quite right.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.967
He was making a lot of
traffic violations, so we...

17:44.067 --> 17:45.933
stopped him, and then he just...

17:47.267 --> 17:49.933
keeps talking and talking
like he's real nervous

17:49.967 --> 17:51.333
or, like, something else
was going on.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.633
So he told us
we could search the car.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.433
I'm not finding
anything so far, but...

17:55.500 --> 17:57.333
maybe he just has a lot to say.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.767
-...going to work, because--
-Yes, sir.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.900
Hey, man, I know y'all meet
so many different personalities.

18:01.933 --> 18:03.500
Every time I go
to the store, dude,

18:03.533 --> 18:05.400
I see all these
weird-ass people,

18:05.433 --> 18:06.767
and they're always
asking for money.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.200
And, uh, lately, I've been
giving it to them, dude.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.400
(chuckles)

18:10.433 --> 18:13.600
Just because, man,
I'm just kind of trying...

18:13.633 --> 18:16.600
make up for all the things
that I've just done in my past.
-Sure.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.967
Let me talk to my partner
real quick. Give me one second.
-Okay.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.633
-Not enough to go with.
-Yeah.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.800
-So you think it could be,
like, full on DUI?

18:24.833 --> 18:26.467
Work it, or...
-Yeah.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.933
Well, uh, talking to him,

18:28.967 --> 18:30.767
he's repeated
the same story three times.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.200
-Oh, I figured.
The way he was talking--

18:32.233 --> 18:33.767
-He, uh...

18:33.800 --> 18:36.333
his pupils are, like,
the size of a pin.

18:36.367 --> 18:39.200
And then he smells of alcohol.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.700
Nothing to arrest him on.

18:41.733 --> 18:44.667
-Wonder if he has anybody
that could give him a ride.

18:44.700 --> 18:47.100
I know he's got a phone
to call for somebody, 'cause
I saw it in the car.

18:47.133 --> 18:48.467
-You want me to ask him?

18:48.500 --> 18:50.167
-Yeah, let's talk to him
and see.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.500
(clears throat)

18:51.533 --> 18:53.067
-I'm under arrest, right?

18:53.067 --> 18:54.267
-No.
-Oh, okay.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.167
-Do you have anybody
you could call for a ride?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.767
-No, sir. Ah, man, I just--

18:57.800 --> 19:00.667
-From what he's saying,
you smell a little bit more
like alcohol

19:00.700 --> 19:02.267
than what you're saying,
and you're being cool.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.333
You're being cooperative,
so if you have somebody
that you could call,

19:05.367 --> 19:06.833
that would be the best bet.

19:06.867 --> 19:10.100
-Can I just park my car and
just walk to my friend's house?

19:10.133 --> 19:12.233
-I mean, it's properly parked.
I mean,

19:12.267 --> 19:14.367
if you want to
leave it there, but--
-Okay.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.067
Hey, man, I really appreciate
y'all not being a dick.

19:17.067 --> 19:20.067
You know, everybody presumes,
like, police officers are
out to get you,

19:20.067 --> 19:21.200
and it's not, you know.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.867
Y'all are out here
to do y'all's job.

19:22.900 --> 19:26.233
Dude, I've spent my whole life
going against everybody,

19:26.267 --> 19:28.600
and going that bad route, man.

19:28.633 --> 19:30.333
And, uh, the charge that I had,

19:30.367 --> 19:33.067
it was, uh, it was just a
(bleep) up situation,

19:33.067 --> 19:35.433
and I-- Excuse my language.
-Sure.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.167
Here's what we've got going.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.900
A warning for
the fail to signal intent,

19:38.933 --> 19:41.067
but a ticket for
the no insurance, okay?
-Cool.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.700
-And you can call that number
if you would rather do that
instead of go up there.

19:43.733 --> 19:46.067
I'll shake your hand, man.
-All right. You seem like
a cool dude, man.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.600
I wish I could have met you
on a different note.

19:47.633 --> 19:49.933
-Have a better night, okay?
-You, too.

19:49.967 --> 19:52.467
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.433
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.600
Cover is code three.

19:55.633 --> 19:58.600
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.400 --> 20:06.100
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.000
-(theme music playing)
