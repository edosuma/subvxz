WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:04.175
Can you really beat her?

00:04.338 --> 00:05.931
- I can.
- Then yes.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.259
Dean. That's not Cass!

00:08.467 --> 00:09.593
Cat's out.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.979
- Lucifer.
- Lucifer.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.983
We've had a coward and a fool
at the helm for too long.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.778
I'm still your master.
Did I let you out of that kennel too soon?

00:19.978 --> 00:23.323
What treasonous thoughts do you have
brewing in that little head of yours?

00:23.482 --> 00:25.860
If you thought you could beat Amara,
you'd be taking the fight to her.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.589
You're not strong enough.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.997
I may be a bit under-equipped.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.621
Did you know the Nazis had
a special branch devoted to archeology?

00:33.825 --> 00:34.997
What is that, mon amour?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.296
And they speak of a super weapon.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.873
Yeah? What was it?

00:39.289 --> 00:40.290
"The Hand of God."

00:40.832 --> 00:41.958
Look, from Men of Letters
to Men of Letters,

00:42.167 --> 00:43.635
I'm fighting a war in the future.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.343
It's not like your war, it's big.
Biblical.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.747
And I need your weapon to win.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.641
Dean's the one with the link to Amara.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.518
Why have I been trying to spare you?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.144
It's kicked.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.023
Who'd have thought the Hand of God
would turn out to be a one-hitter?

00:57.516 --> 00:59.436
This is a barn-burner, folks!

00:59.810 --> 01:02.188
Off the ropes! Picks him up and...

01:03.480 --> 01:04.527
Oh, it's a back-breaker!

01:05.983 --> 01:07.030
One, two...

01:07.192 --> 01:08.592
It's only a two-count.

01:08.652 --> 01:12.202
The rookie, Shawn Harley,
fails to take the Hangman down.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.333
Ooh, a stinger to the neck.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.670
Are you seriously drunk right now?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.753
Just shut up and get ready.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.590
Ooh, and it's a stinger to the back.

01:25.836 --> 01:26.928
He's going in!

01:27.170 --> 01:28.922
He takes him to the turnbuckle.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.219
Yeah!

01:32.593 --> 01:35.096
- Oh, and we know what's coming next!
- Yeah!

01:35.345 --> 01:38.098
Give it up, baby! It's all over!

01:38.348 --> 01:39.850
I'm gonna hang his ass!

01:43.937 --> 01:45.234
Oh, yeah, baby!

01:45.897 --> 01:47.570
It's all over now, folks!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.785
- We have lift-off!
- Stop!

01:51.028 --> 01:52.746
And Harley struggling to breathe now.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.539
He's turning blue.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.047
Hey, has anyone seen my rope?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.142
What the hell? I almost died out there.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.255
Harley, back off.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.098
You're gonna take the wino's side? Really?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.192
- It's not what this is...
- Whatever.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.554
You old-timers
like to stick together, right?

02:14.384 --> 02:15.761
Do us a favor.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.059
Keep a leash on your boy.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.769
Or he might get hurt.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.624
Hey!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.525
Hey. Have you seen the, uh...

03:04.768 --> 03:06.315
Yeah, thanks.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.488
- Bottoms up.
- Yeah.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.612
What's with the bag?

03:12.484 --> 03:13.531
Oh.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.825
You remember Top Notch Wrestling?

03:16.488 --> 03:19.867
Yeah. Those wrestling shows
Dad took us to when we were kids.

03:20.784 --> 03:25.790
Right. Came across an obituary last night.
Larry "The Hangman" Lee died.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.466
Oh, no. Wasn't he, uh...

03:28.667 --> 03:30.044
He was Dad's favorite.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.012
Every time that noose would come out,
Dad would be up on his feet.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.199
That was one of the few times
I ever saw him actually happy.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.555
Yeah, I remember that.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.354
Anyway, the funeral's
less than a day's drive.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.309
I say we go pay our respects.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.020
Uh...

03:44.558 --> 03:46.731
Don't you think our plates
are a little full?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.400
I mean, it's bad out there, Dean.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.569
Yeah, Sam, you think I don't know that?

03:51.982 --> 03:54.155
We've done nothing but
mainline lore for a week, okay?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.536
We've got jack on another
Hand of God and Amara,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.831
and we've got even less jack
on how to save Cass.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.373
Yeah, if he wants to be saved.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.252
He does. Even if he doesn't know it yet.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.836
- Dean...
- I’m burnt, man, okay?

04:12.002 --> 04:15.097
And I need... We need to get out of here.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.050
Let's go stretch our legs.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.687
Oh, good.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.031
Yes!

04:33.356 --> 04:36.030
Remember ABC.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.238
Always Be Closing.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.412
The sooner you little storm clouds
find me another Hand of God,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.334
the happier I will be.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.210
You want me to be happy,
don't you, doll face?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.085
Of course, my Lord.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.385
Good answer.

04:54.878 --> 05:00.806
All right. You're gonna look high,
look low, far and wide.

05:01.009 --> 05:05.936
Search every warehouse, every farmhouse,
every henhouse, outhouse and doghouse.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.532
What about you, little puppy?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.284
You have something to add?

05:19.694 --> 05:20.946
Nothing, Master.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.789
Really?

05:26.952 --> 05:28.795
I would tell you. I swear.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.547
I believe you.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.130
May I return to my task?

05:38.964 --> 05:40.056
Oh. Of course.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.808
Uh-uh.

05:44.469 --> 05:48.190
Just one minor tweak.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.485
Use your tongue.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.308
Dude, check it out.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.182
- That's "The Scream" Casey Lyons.
- Oh, yeah.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.440
There's "Wrecking Ball" Calhoon.
Wow.

06:30.932 --> 06:31.979
The Brooklyn Beast.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.148
What happened to 'em?

06:34.352 --> 06:36.320
I mean, they're all broken.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.870
Dude, dude. Gunnar-freaking-Lawless.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.870
- Groupie much?
- Shut up.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.835
Should I go say hi? I should go say hi.
I'm gonna go say hi.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.041
I...

06:52.245 --> 06:53.337
I know it's hard.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.755
All right, take care.

06:55.540 --> 07:00.262
Hi, sir. I, uh, saw you
standing over here,

07:00.503 --> 07:02.756
and told my brother
that I should come over and say hi.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.058
So I came over and, uh...

07:07.552 --> 07:08.644
Hi.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.312
Gunnar Lawless.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.649
Oh, I know. Man, I got to tell you,

07:13.850 --> 07:16.524
I worshipped you growing up.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.526
Thanks. I plan on keeping that hand.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.695
Oh, sorry.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.162
Uh, you know, when I was 10,
I got my first B&E,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.330
borrowing some family's pay-per-view

07:27.530 --> 07:31.205
so that I could watch the cage match
between you and The Tower of Power.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.707
I'm not sure how I feel about
contributing to your juvenile delinquency,

07:35.914 --> 07:37.632
but appreciate it all the same.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.301
Yeah. You were robbed, by the way.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.596
Bet your ass I was.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.512
Oh, yes.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.137
Hey.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.063
You're Rio.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.982
You used to manage
"Superbomb" Sanchez, right?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.273
That was a long time ago.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.356
Well, yeah, but you...

08:02.983 --> 08:04.075
You look great.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.455
Sorry, uh, wrong place.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.034
It's just, you were my first crush.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.123
You weren't one of those guys that had
my poster above his bed, were you?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.462
What?  No.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.300
Are you still managing?

08:24.713 --> 08:27.683
Oh, no, I call some matches sometimes,

08:27.924 --> 08:30.848
but I'm mostly
behind the curtain, you know.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.056
Booking the shows
and taking care of the guys.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.484
Yeah. Must be hard to see one go.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.436
Yeah.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.273
Well, we spent a lot of time
on the road together.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.154
We're like family.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.283
And, lately, I have seen
too many of my boys be put in the dirt.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.250
I knew Hangman for 25 years.

08:53.992 --> 08:57.292
He was a good man. Great family.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.756
I just can't believe he would do this.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.591
Do what?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.132
Kill himself.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.930
Wait, that wasn't in the obituary.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.390
Uh, the family didn't want
that advertised, so...

09:13.470 --> 09:15.268
Speaking of which, if you'll excuse me.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.148
Poor son of a bitch.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.025
Yeah.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.448
You know, uh, word is...

09:25.648 --> 09:27.867
Yeah, I heard.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.704
They're gonna have
a memorial show tonight.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.322
I mean, I know you're
itching to get back, but, uh...

09:32.530 --> 09:33.873
We should go to it.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.998
- Really?
- Why not?

09:37.202 --> 09:39.250
World's still gonna be
screwed tomorrow, right?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.210
Yeah.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.090
The Brooklyn Beast
returns against Rush in an epic...

09:43.249 --> 09:44.296
All right.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.177
...Iron Man match-up!

09:46.544 --> 09:48.546
Let me hear you make some noise.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.183
Are you ready?

09:55.136 --> 09:58.982
You know, I remember the Top Notch shows
being grander. You know, top-notch.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.106
Yeah. Well, you drink enough,
it'll be just like old times.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.118
Rio? You dog.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.946
Oh, shut up. Dude, we met at the wake.
She's nice.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.408
You tell her you used to have a poster
of her over your bed when you were a kid?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.244
- No.
- Yeah.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.877
Get this. A guy at the wake told me
they're only making 25 bucks tonight.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.795
- That's it?
- Yeah.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.344
Well, that hardly seems worth it.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.929
You think about that, town after town,
putting your ass on the line

10:30.130 --> 10:31.473
for next to nothing?

10:31.673 --> 10:34.017
No money, no glory.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.306
Well...

10:35.593 --> 10:38.517
You realize you just literally
described our jobs?

10:40.348 --> 10:41.645
Ooh, excuse me, fellas.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.210
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.111
- This is gonna be great.
- Yeah.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.562
Got to love some rasslin', am I right?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.114
Yeah.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.946
Beer's cheap, kid's entertained.
 Parenting.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.240
Remember, don't tell Mom any of that.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.701
Yeah, now that brings me back.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.532
You want to not try and ruin
one of the nicest things

11:03.621 --> 11:06.044
Dad ever did for us, please? Thank you.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.254
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

11:07.417 --> 11:10.216
Put your hands together for Hellrazor!

11:20.305 --> 11:21.477
Almost showtime.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.652
Got a little something for you.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.372
And now,

11:38.573 --> 11:44.580
ladies and gentlemen, put your hands
together for Gunnar Lawless.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.006
Yeah!

11:48.166 --> 11:49.713
Yeah!

11:52.337 --> 11:56.308
Yeah. Oh, yeah!

11:58.009 --> 11:59.602
Right, right!

12:00.345 --> 12:02.143
Hey, get up, show some respect.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.978
Who's getting it? Who's getting it, huh?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.317
Who's got this?

12:06.476 --> 12:09.696
Remember, when he takes a glove off
and gives it to some kid before the match?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.565
Whoo!

12:14.025 --> 12:15.902
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Come on! Over here!

12:16.277 --> 12:17.324
Cool!

12:22.867 --> 12:23.993
Maybe next time.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.330
It's all right, I'm not a child.
It's fine.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.177
Cross kick right in the face.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.472
Lawless up on the ropes now.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.135
om

12:43.721 --> 12:45.064
Oh. Oh. Oh.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.150
- Get up! Get up, Gunnar!
- Come on, man.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.690
You can do it, Gunnar.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.071
Get up, buddy!

12:54.482 --> 12:55.859
This one's out of the cage!

12:56.067 --> 12:57.990
Oh!

12:58.528 --> 12:59.950
Hey, referee, the match!

13:01.990 --> 13:03.788
Come on. Open your eyes.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.168
Come on, man.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.710
Get out of it!

13:11.457 --> 13:12.674
Gunnar!

13:13.293 --> 13:16.092
Go! Go! Go!

13:22.218 --> 13:23.765
- Yeah!
- Here we go.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.018
Come on, let's do this!

13:36.024 --> 13:38.072
Up and over! Up and over!

13:43.614 --> 13:45.457
One, two, three!

13:47.452 --> 13:49.625
Oh, yeah! Yes!

13:50.955 --> 13:52.957
I got to drain the dragon. Be good.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.131
Oh, but it's all over now, folks.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.487
Yes, yes, yes.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.380
All right, you guys are good.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.307
Hey, buddy.
Try to keep your head up, okay?

14:43.508 --> 14:44.600
Thank you.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.308
Come on. Let's go.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.311
- Poor kid.
- Yeah.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.688
What'd they say?

14:53.184 --> 14:54.481
You're not gonna believe this.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.279
The body was marked.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.240
Wow. By what?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.641
What, he get in a tickle-fight with
Edward Scissorhands?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.286
Dude.

15:05.363 --> 15:09.118
Look, the cuts look deliberate,
you know, ritualistic.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.565
What, you think this is a case?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.748
You think it's not?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.128
Okay, what're you thinking?

15:13.329 --> 15:16.333
I don't know. A witch maybe?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.943
You know, I'll head back to the motel,
look into the symbol.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.680
I'll stay here, shake some trees.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.852
Hello?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.439
FBI. I got some questions.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.197
Bueller?

16:01.419 --> 16:02.591
Whoo!

16:08.176 --> 16:10.053
Oh, yeah!

16:13.222 --> 16:14.394
Nice moves.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.942
Yes.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.565
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, good.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.865
Oh.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.614
Uh...

16:26.360 --> 16:29.409
Agent Roussimoff, FBI.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.541
You were at the wake, weren't you?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.039
I was, yeah.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.543
And then the body dropped
and back on the clock.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.174
Did you know the deceased?

16:40.374 --> 16:44.174
I'm... I sold him some tickets.
He had a kid, right?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.134
Yeah.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.011
Wow.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.510
Maybe my boys are right.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.641
Maybe we really are cursed.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.685
Cursed?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.270
Back in Shreveport,
our first stop on the tour,

16:57.475 --> 17:01.025
a maintenance guy found a body
stashed in a dumpster

17:01.229 --> 17:04.028
behind the VFW. And now this.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.628
Could I get a list of your whole crew?

17:08.653 --> 17:10.826
Uh, wrestlers, roadies.
Anybody that you roll with.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.334
We use locals for all
the setups and concessions.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.586
I can only afford to travel my boys.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.396
And where would they be right now?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.885
Try the nearest bar.
I know that's where I'll be.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.087
Okay. Thanks.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.800
Hmm.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.556
Yeah.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.937
We don't have much time.
I'm getting you out of here.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.901
Now.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.067
I can't leave.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.780
You can. You still have friends,
people who want you back,

17:52.321 --> 17:53.743
who want Lucifer gone.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.158
I don't know what he's done to you,
I can't imagine,

17:59.328 --> 18:04.129
but you're not a slave, a dog.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.340
You're Crowley.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.968
And the devil should be afraid of you.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.689
Whoo!

18:40.494 --> 18:41.586
Hey.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.084
Hey.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.050
Dean, right?

18:47.209 --> 18:48.426
Yeah.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.513
Enjoy the show?

18:51.881 --> 18:54.509
Show was great. Yeah, you were great.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.936
After the show, not so much, but...

18:58.137 --> 19:01.107
Yeah, I heard. It's a damn shame.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.479
Yeah.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.072
That's, uh...
Kind of why I'm here.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.444
Uh...

19:12.234 --> 19:13.874
Kind of buried the lead on that one, huh?

19:13.903 --> 19:16.122
Yeah. Thanks.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.327
You're welcome.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.039
I hear this isn't the first murder
at a Top Notch show.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.250
It's a rough crowd,
inside the ring and out.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.960
Yeah.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.838
'92.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.763
I'm leaving the ring,
and some damn reprobate goes at me

19:32.963 --> 19:34.886
with a broken beer bottle.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.811
Well, couple of years ago

19:39.804 --> 19:42.728
a perp got the drop on me,

19:42.932 --> 19:44.900
decided to take a chunk
of my leg as a keepsake.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.446
See this right here?

19:49.647 --> 19:51.194
Far as I can bend these.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.234
Thanks to good old Jonah Rancid

19:53.442 --> 19:56.867
and all 400 pounds of him
just dropping down on me.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.326
Wow.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.412
Yeah. But you're still out there.
Still doing it.

20:02.159 --> 20:06.630
I've been beat up, spit on,
stabbed, roughed up,

20:06.831 --> 20:10.256
but I will be damned
if I didn't always get back up.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.679
One thing I learned?

20:13.879 --> 20:16.678
You got to keep on grinding
no matter what's thrown your way.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.308
Damn, you're awesome.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.014
Tell that to my ex-wives.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.193
Yeah, give me a sec.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.653
', what you got?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.113
A lot, actually.

20:35.317 --> 20:39.367
Uh, so every stop on the Top Notch tour,
somebody turned up dead.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.125
It didn't all happen at the venue,
and most of them look like accidents,

20:43.325 --> 20:44.577
but they all had the symbol.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.082
Hangman, too.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.116
I thought he killed himself.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.124
Yeah, well, that's what Rio said,

20:50.332 --> 20:52.334
but the cops
are treating it like an open case.

20:52.543 --> 20:56.093
They're thinking, and I quote,
"It's some kind of weird, Satanic crap."

20:57.381 --> 20:59.600
- Awesome.
- Yeah, it gets better.

20:59.800 --> 21:05.557
That symbol? Ancient Sumerian said to have
the power to "pluck the spark of life."

21:07.224 --> 21:08.396
And that means?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.024
Souls, maybe?

21:11.479 --> 21:12.605
So we're talking demon?

21:12.813 --> 21:13.905
It's worth checking out.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.404
Well, Rio says that
they use locals to set up, so...

21:16.609 --> 21:18.169
So it's got to be one of the wrestlers.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.955
Maybe. All right, just get here.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.247
What're you gonna do?

21:22.573 --> 21:23.995
I'm working on it.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.500
Yo, sweetheart, hit me again!

21:28.996 --> 21:31.044
Hey, Harley. Go easy.
I think you had enough.

21:31.582 --> 21:32.674
Screw off.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.297
Just trying to help.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.882
Like you helped me in Fort Worth?

21:39.381 --> 21:43.602
What? You think I don't know
you got me kicked off the card?

21:44.053 --> 21:46.806
You wouldn’t job to Crazy D,
and I couldn't abide by that.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.354
Yeah.

21:50.684 --> 21:54.689
I think you just can't stand the thought
of me stealing your thunder.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.615
Kid, I got no worries about that.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.288
All right. That's enough!

22:07.618 --> 22:09.916
Get up, old man!
Or do you need your go-juice?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.212
What?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.676
That's right. I saw him and his dealer.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.970
Your golden boy's a freaking junkie.

22:18.587 --> 22:19.679
- He's lying.
- Like hell!

22:19.880 --> 22:23.680
All right, all right. Harley,
we got two days till Memphis.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.386
Sleep it off.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.471
Gunnar, I'll talk to you
about this tomorrow.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.475
Go.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.069
Hey.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.275
- Hey.
- You okay?

22:35.437 --> 22:36.984
Yeah, yeah.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.318
I've been hit harder
by guys a lot tougher.

22:40.818 --> 22:41.944
Yeah.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.697
Why, uh... Why didn't you fight back?

22:46.073 --> 22:47.393
I got nothing to prove.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.669
Hey. You okay, boss?

22:50.870 --> 22:53.623
Yeah, yeah. It's just another day, huh?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.470
Well, hey, here's, uh...

22:59.670 --> 23:01.190
Here's to being the bigger man, right?

23:01.755 --> 23:03.553
Mmm. Obliged.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.357
We're gonna need more shots.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.235
A lot more.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.906
This way.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.162
I wasn't...

23:25.362 --> 23:26.579
She made me.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.176
- How did you...
- I'm Crowley.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.571
Dean?

24:00.856 --> 24:02.233
- Dean!
- Mmm.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.735
Hey!

24:08.822 --> 24:10.824
Dude, you okay?

24:11.033 --> 24:12.159
Yeah.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.045
What happened?

24:17.331 --> 24:20.961
Mostly tequila. Cut with holy water.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.047
I bought drinks for all the wrestlers,
and then, you know, they were like,

24:25.214 --> 24:28.263
"Well, you got to drink, too."

24:30.928 --> 24:32.646
Man, they can drink.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.519
Especially Rio. Oh...

24:34.723 --> 24:36.363
I think I heard my liver screaming at me.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.523
So, did anyone react?

24:38.727 --> 24:39.819
No.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.071
And you got them all?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.732
Uh, except Harley.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.140
The ultimate douchebag bailed
before I could get to him.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.569
Why's it so bright in here?

24:46.777 --> 24:48.654
- All right. Let's go find him.
- Okay.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.997
- Dude!
- Coming.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.104
Harley!

25:15.055 --> 25:16.602
Harley!

25:34.199 --> 25:35.371
That's not good.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.337
Uh, you think?

25:47.838 --> 25:49.340
My Lord.

25:49.715 --> 25:50.967
That's better.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.849
Now let's go find the ace up my sleeve.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.519
Hey, check this out. Come here.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.527
- Got something?
- Yeah, yeah. Uh, security cam footage.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.488
All right, let's see if we got anything.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.320
Um, so this is 1:07 a.m.
Harley heads to his room...

26:12.029 --> 26:13.201
Um...

26:14.782 --> 26:16.250
- Who's...
- No idea.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.000
But, in there for a few minutes
and that's Harley.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.706
Wow. Looks knocked out.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.336
Yeah.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.632
Now, let's see.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.056
Lawless?

26:32.216 --> 26:35.720
If Harley is a demon,
then how did Gunnar get the drop on him?

26:37.221 --> 26:38.473
Let's find him and ask him.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.618
Hey! Help!

27:02.079 --> 27:04.582
Dude, what the hell is going on?

27:07.000 --> 27:13.133
Look, I know I've been a dick,
but I'm sorry, okay?

27:14.299 --> 27:19.476
I took a shot at you, it was a cheap shot,
it was... It was a cheap-ass shot.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.442
And I just...

27:26.520 --> 27:29.319
Just don't hurt me. Please?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.030
It's not my call.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.334
Hello, Shawn.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.296
I'm your new best friend.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.170
Okay, traffic cameras
show the truck heading north on Wilson,

27:51.378 --> 27:53.005
past 1st and 2nd,

27:53.213 --> 27:54.465
but it never got to 3rd.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.556
- Wait a second, that's by the...
- Yeah.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.233
You want my what?

28:05.851 --> 28:08.445
Forget what I want, what do you want?

28:09.897 --> 28:13.276
Money? Women? Glory?

28:13.859 --> 28:16.157
A big, shiny belt?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.409
Say the word, and it's yours.

28:19.907 --> 28:20.999
'Cause you're a demon?

28:21.742 --> 28:22.994
Businessman.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.666
- Dude, what the hell is...
- Eyes on me, champ.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.416
Think about it.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.548
No more crappy motels, Podunk towns.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.754
You'll have the life you always wanted.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.136
Gumdrops and G-strings,
as far as the eye can see.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.969
And all I ask in return is...

28:40.177 --> 28:41.269
My soul.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.267
And your service.

28:43.472 --> 28:49.696
See, I might occasionally ask you
to do me a teeny, tiny little favor.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.155
What kind of favor?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.362
The kill somebody kind.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.743
Why me?

28:57.194 --> 29:01.745
Because I like you.
You're brash, driven and hungry.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.160
I'm looking for new franchisees.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.667
Why have one when I can have two?

29:10.040 --> 29:11.257
You did this?

29:11.792 --> 29:14.420
Gunnar's what I like to call
a satisfied customer.

29:16.088 --> 29:20.138
So do we have a deal?

29:29.142 --> 29:30.314
No.

29:32.354 --> 29:37.235
Look, man, I've never been
much for God or whatever.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.114
Sort of just thought that when
your curtain came down, that was it.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.119
Night, night.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.037
But if you're a demon,
that means there's a Hell,

29:48.912 --> 29:51.916
and if there's a Hell, there is a Heaven.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.970
And I'm not giving up my shot at paradise
for a belt I can win on my own.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.548
That so?

30:06.263 --> 30:07.856
You're talented, Shawn.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.518
But the human body, it's just so fragile.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.655
One injury, one wrong step.

30:14.855 --> 30:19.952
Like, say, if somebody
severed your Achilles tendon.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.370
Poof, you're done.

30:22.571 --> 30:23.823
Duke, no.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.636
You're up.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.339
He's just a kid.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.226
Do it.

30:57.481 --> 30:58.858
What is this?

30:59.733 --> 31:01.235
My personal lockup.

31:02.152 --> 31:04.154
Keepsakes, mementos.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.584
Things I'd prefer the rabble
not to get their grubby hands on.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.831
Is that you?

31:11.036 --> 31:12.834
Oh, the good old days.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.298
Why are we here?

31:20.921 --> 31:22.173
For this.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.306
The Rod of Aaron.

31:27.511 --> 31:31.857
Created by God on the sixth day,
and given to Aaron, brother of Moses.

31:32.057 --> 31:36.028
I knew it was powerful.
But I had no idea that it was a...

31:36.228 --> 31:37.525
A Hand of God.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.899
Can I touch it?

31:40.107 --> 31:41.825
With all due respect, Simmons.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.465
I don't think you can handle my rod.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.409
I bet I can.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.961
Is it just me or is it getting
a little phallic in here?

32:17.394 --> 32:18.520
Drop it!

32:31.408 --> 32:33.410
Isn't this a fun surprise.

32:38.748 --> 32:43.094
You really thought
you could double-cross me?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.547
Me?

32:48.258 --> 32:50.386
You know, I invented the double-cross?

32:50.594 --> 32:52.221
Like, literally.

32:53.597 --> 32:58.148
Of course, I couldn't have
orchestrated all of this without

32:59.227 --> 33:02.197
the lovely, talented Simmons here.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.150
She, um...

33:05.567 --> 33:07.786
She hates you, BT dubs.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.113
Yeah, I really do.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.495
Yeah, they all do.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.953
Like every demon in Hell.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.481
Can't really blame them, can you?

33:17.662 --> 33:23.510
I mean, maybe once
you were the evilest evil

33:23.710 --> 33:28.637
that ever evil-ed,
present company excluded.

33:29.841 --> 33:35.314
But now, you're nothing but
Dean Winchester's number-one fan.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.350
Sam and Dean,

33:39.226 --> 33:42.605
got to admit, after all the stories,

33:43.480 --> 33:46.450
I thought you'd be more.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.614
Well, sorry to disappoint.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.954
It's my fault, you get your hopes up.

33:51.196 --> 33:55.246
You want an LA 10,
but you settle for a Kansas five.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.463
Life, right? The name's...

34:00.622 --> 34:01.794
We don't care.

34:02.582 --> 34:06.132
Okay, small talk over. Kill them.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.422
Gunnar. Gunnar, no, wait. Gunnar. Hey.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.757
Dean!

34:22.476 --> 34:25.606
I knew you were hiding something.

34:25.813 --> 34:29.659
I could see that last
spark of defiance in your eyes.

34:32.612 --> 34:36.583
And rather than beating it out of you,
which is doable,

34:37.074 --> 34:38.167
but messy,

34:39.159 --> 34:41.504
I let you lead me here.

34:51.797 --> 34:54.347
So I'm gonna take this

34:57.345 --> 35:02.317
and then I'm gonna
take you, and, oh, puppy,

35:03.101 --> 35:04.944
you're not gonna like what comes next.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.465
You looking for this?

35:38.470 --> 35:42.976
You really think you could
double-cross me? Me?

35:43.558 --> 35:45.526
I perfected the double-cross.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.861
Like, literally.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.087
Whew.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.508
So this is what it feels like to be God.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.676
Not bad. Tingly!

36:11.252 --> 36:16.600
So, if this can hurt something
as powerful as The Darkness,

36:17.217 --> 36:20.721
I wonder, what could it do to you?

36:24.891 --> 36:26.017
- No!

36:30.605 --> 36:32.448
Sorry, kid. I don't want to do this.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.863
No? Then don't.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.280
You say that like I got a choice.
That guy out there? He's a...

36:38.530 --> 36:41.079
He's a demon. I know.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.040
And I know about Hell.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.122
And deals, all of it.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.584
What's he got over you?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.423
You sold your soul, didn't you?

36:59.384 --> 37:03.764
Ten years ago
I wanted another shot at that belt.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.898
Fifty thousand people screaming my name.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.816
I was desperate and dumb.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.491
But you only held the title
for, like, a week.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.657
Desperate and dumb.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.078
Okay. Okay.

37:27.287 --> 37:29.005
Look, you screwed up, all right?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.249
Trust me, I've been there.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.670
But it is never too late
to do the right thing.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.972
You really believe that?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.354
I have to.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.339
You made me bleed my own blood.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.395
You're out of juice, huh?

38:33.228 --> 38:34.730
Bollocks.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.000
Does Crowley know you're doing this?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.870
Crowley's Lucifer's bitch-boy,
which is why I'm doing this.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.417
Stealing souls?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.209
Building a nest egg.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.372
With The Darkness out,
and the devil running Hell,

38:52.580 --> 38:56.175
well, it's kind of every demon
for him-her-shimself.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.503
So why do you need Lawless?

38:59.170 --> 39:01.264
Well, I can't be everywhere.

39:01.506 --> 39:05.010
When the G-man's deal came due,
I gave him a choice.

39:05.218 --> 39:08.768
End up Hellhound chow,
or collect souls for me.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.265
I'm delegating.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.517
That's what good managers do.

39:14.394 --> 39:15.691
Hey!

39:16.020 --> 39:17.522
Hey yourself, handsome.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.861
Now this, this is my favorite part.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.962
Thanks.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.545
Dean? Hey. Dean.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.052
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.061
What?

39:48.428 --> 39:49.645
Hellhounds.

39:50.763 --> 39:53.061
I always wondered what they sound like.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.487
Listen, man. You, uh...

40:03.484 --> 40:08.081
No. I've never been a good man.

40:09.949 --> 40:14.580
I look in the mirror
and I hate the face looking back at me.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.920
No, I, uh... I got this coming.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.143
Go on. Get out.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.937
Now.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.287
You okay?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.373
Not even a little bit.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.710
Lawless was a good guy.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.836
He didn't deserve to go out like that,
you know.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.544
Dean, you know what?
He made a bad decision.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.137
We've been there.

41:05.713 --> 41:09.513
Yeah. Yeah, you, me, now Cass.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.231
Dean, we'll get him back.
We will. We just got to...

41:15.390 --> 41:16.983
Keep grinding.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.759
No matter how much it hurts,
no matter how hard it gets,

41:20.812 --> 41:22.234
you got to keep grinding.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.033
Right.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.363
And that's how we're gonna win.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.078
And we're gonna win.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.161
We're gonna save Cass,
we're gonna ice the devil,

41:35.326 --> 41:37.328
and we're gonna shank The Darkness

41:38.329 --> 41:40.502
and anyone that gets in our way...

41:42.250 --> 41:43.502
Well, God help them.

41:46.421 --> 41:47.764
Damn right.

41:50.258 --> 41:51.510
Damn right.

42:25.626 --> 42:26.627
