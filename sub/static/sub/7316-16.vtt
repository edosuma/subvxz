00:04.086 --> 00:06.869
NAVIGATION VOICE:
Proceed straight
on Seventh Street.

00:08.782 --> 00:11.173
Are you sure you gave me
the correct address?

00:11.217 --> 00:14.086
All I see are warehouses.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.130
Hmm.

00:16.173 --> 00:18.869
NAVIGATION VOICE:
In 200 feet,

00:18.913 --> 00:21.000
your destination will be
on the left.

00:21.043 --> 00:22.695
Well, I don't get it.

00:22.739 --> 00:24.565
My GPS says I'm pulling up
right now,

00:24.608 --> 00:26.043
and I haven't seen a house
for a few miles...

00:26.086 --> 00:27.608
[gunshots]

00:30.913 --> 00:34.434
NAVIGATION VOICE:
You have reached
your final destination.

01:05.304 --> 01:06.695
TONY:
No, you didn't cry?

01:06.739 --> 01:08.043
Nope.

01:08.086 --> 01:09.347
Not a single tear?

01:09.391 --> 01:10.260
BISHOP:
Nada.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.739
¿Por qué?

01:11.782 --> 01:12.608
What's this?

01:12.652 --> 01:13.826
We're talking Top Gun.

01:13.869 --> 01:15.478
I just saw it.

01:16.391 --> 01:17.608
Her virgin viewing.

01:17.652 --> 01:19.913
Tony's frustrated
I didn't cry.

01:19.956 --> 01:21.826
And you were
speaking Spanish why?

01:21.869 --> 01:23.304
Oh. No lo sé.

01:23.347 --> 01:25.043
TONY:
Okay, ignoring the fact

01:25.086 --> 01:27.347
that you spent your entire life
without seeing

01:27.391 --> 01:29.304
1986's undisputed

01:29.347 --> 01:31.304
action masterpiece, let me
just ask you one question:

01:31.347 --> 01:33.260
What took you so long?

01:33.304 --> 01:35.217
Busy, I guess.

01:35.260 --> 01:36.521
"Busy, I guess."

01:36.565 --> 01:38.304
What-what?

01:38.347 --> 01:40.043
I bet she carved out a little
time to see Frozenlast year.

01:40.086 --> 01:41.347
Ooh, great film.

01:41.391 --> 01:42.478
Classic film.

01:42.521 --> 01:43.608
You can't miss
with a singing snowman.

01:43.652 --> 01:45.652
[laughs]
Everybody loves Olaf.

01:45.695 --> 01:47.043
Stay in your lane, McGee.

01:47.086 --> 01:48.391
No problemo, senor.

01:48.434 --> 01:50.565
Why are you talking
bad Spanish, McGee?

01:50.608 --> 01:52.086
Uh, not sure, boss.

01:52.130 --> 01:53.347
Good news though.

01:53.391 --> 01:55.173
Got your new smartphone
almost ready to go.

01:55.217 --> 01:57.347
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

01:57.391 --> 01:58.521
Smartphone?

01:58.565 --> 01:59.826
Gibbs?

01:59.869 --> 02:01.347
Yeah. I talked him into trying
out this bad boy

02:01.391 --> 02:03.000
for a couple days.

02:03.043 --> 02:04.434
All the latest technology,
top of the line.

02:04.478 --> 02:06.521
I'm telling you,
he's going to love it.Cool.

02:06.565 --> 02:07.782
You've met Gibbs, right?

02:07.826 --> 02:09.130
GIBBS:
Come on, let's go.

02:09.173 --> 02:11.086
We got a dead civilian
in the warehouse district.

02:11.130 --> 02:12.304
Civilian?

02:12.347 --> 02:14.913
Why us?'Cause Metro asked for us.

02:14.956 --> 02:16.173
Hey, boss,
if we rode together,

02:16.217 --> 02:18.043
we could do
a short phone tutorial.

02:18.086 --> 02:20.000
Not going to be in Spanish,
is it?

02:20.043 --> 02:21.826
Not to beat a dead horse,[sighs]: Too late.

02:21.869 --> 02:24.086
but how did you feel when
Goose's jet went down

02:24.130 --> 02:27.478
and Maverick is holding
dead Goose in his arms?

02:27.521 --> 02:29.000
Goose died?

02:29.043 --> 02:30.521
Yes, Goose died!

02:30.565 --> 02:32.043
What do you think
the point of the movie is?!

02:32.086 --> 02:33.565
Didn't you watch it?

02:33.608 --> 02:35.304
Yeah, I did,
most of it.

02:35.347 --> 02:37.043
I got bored.

02:37.086 --> 02:39.217
Oh, Great Balls of Fire.

02:41.869 --> 02:42.826
Lieutenant Cody Oaks.

02:42.869 --> 02:44.956
You must be Agent Gibbs.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.956
[chuckles]
No. DiNozzo.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.608
I understand the deceased
isn't military,

02:48.652 --> 02:50.956
so what are we doing here,
Lieutenant?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.130
Uh, the victim, Leland Spears,
was found by a passerby.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.956
Wallet's intact,
but his ID was flagged.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.043
By who?
You.

02:59.086 --> 03:01.347
Said, "If arrested, immobilized,
or deceased,

03:01.391 --> 03:02.913
notify NIS immediately."

03:02.956 --> 03:05.304
"NIS"?
Our agency

03:05.347 --> 03:08.043
changed its name to NCIS
way back in '94.

03:08.086 --> 03:09.652
'92, actually.

03:09.695 --> 03:10.956
Why was it flagged?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I was hoping y'all
could tell me.

03:24.086 --> 03:26.043
TONY:
What, did you come by way
of the Panama Canal?

03:27.260 --> 03:29.086
Ye olde dragons.

03:29.130 --> 03:32.130
Looks like something from your
online computer gaming world.

03:32.173 --> 03:33.826
McGEE:
Could be a gamer.

03:33.869 --> 03:35.956
First person's sweeping
the country. In fact,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.173
Robert Morris University
has an E-Sports Varsity Squad...

03:38.217 --> 03:40.521
Focus, McGee.

03:42.565 --> 03:44.304
Why did Metro call us?

03:44.347 --> 03:46.478
It's got something to do
with NIS.

03:46.521 --> 03:49.695
Hey, you guys stop
somewhere?

03:49.739 --> 03:51.130
Well, I wanted to show boss

03:51.173 --> 03:53.260
his new smartphone's
built-in navigation system.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.304
Mm. Didn't work out?

03:55.347 --> 03:57.000
You think?

03:58.739 --> 04:00.956
GIBBS:
Two to the heart.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.608
TONY:
Yeah, we didn't find
any shell casings.

04:02.652 --> 04:04.173
I don't think you will.

04:04.217 --> 04:05.913
Trained shooter.

04:05.956 --> 04:07.043
Who's the victim?

04:07.086 --> 04:09.260
Leland Robert Spears.

04:10.608 --> 04:11.956
Spears?

04:12.826 --> 04:15.000
Born 3 March 1959?

04:15.043 --> 04:17.000
Uh... yeah.

04:17.043 --> 04:18.434
That's his birth date.

04:18.478 --> 04:20.521
How could you possibly
know that?

04:20.565 --> 04:22.521
McGee,

04:22.565 --> 04:24.565
tell Metro this is now
an NCIS crime scene.

04:24.608 --> 04:26.565
Call Ducky down here.

04:26.608 --> 04:28.304
You know this guy, boss?

04:28.347 --> 04:31.565
Leland Robert Spears...

04:31.608 --> 04:33.043
that's me.

04:45.347 --> 04:46.695
GIBBS:
Back in the NIS days,

04:46.739 --> 04:49.217
Director Morrow formed
a small undercover unit.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.782
As part of that, I was issued
a backstopped identity.

04:51.826 --> 04:54.086
Leland Spears.

04:54.130 --> 04:56.608
McGEE:
Well, this new Leland Spears
has no arrest record.

04:56.652 --> 04:58.000
Not much of a record at all.

04:58.043 --> 04:59.565
Living under
a stolen identity,

04:59.608 --> 05:01.565
not surprised
he laid low.

05:01.608 --> 05:03.086
What was your
case, boss?

05:03.130 --> 05:04.478
Cases.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.043
Worked at least a dozen,

05:06.086 --> 05:08.652
everything from drug trafficking
to a double homicide.

05:08.695 --> 05:10.304
I was told

05:10.347 --> 05:13.217
that the origin of the identity
was untraceable.

05:13.260 --> 05:14.739
It probably was back then.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.652
With the online landscape

05:16.695 --> 05:17.869
the way it is nowadays,

05:17.913 --> 05:19.652
hackers can access
just about anything.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.782
You think cyber-geeks
did this?
Definitely.

05:21.826 --> 05:24.043
Any physical files would've
been destroyed years ago.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.826
Whoever it was went to a lot
of trouble to secure the ID.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.043
Well, let's find out why.

05:28.086 --> 05:29.782
Spears' apartment--
you and McGee, go.

05:29.826 --> 05:32.913
Abby find anything on the
car or on the cell phone?

05:32.956 --> 05:35.956
I don't know.
That's my cue to find out.

05:42.043 --> 05:43.173
Where's Gibbs?

05:43.217 --> 05:45.130
Well, he sent me.

05:45.173 --> 05:46.739
Are you disappointed?

05:46.782 --> 05:48.130
Never.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.478
Something different about you?

05:50.521 --> 05:53.217
Well, I got a new tattoo,
but it's strategically placed

05:53.260 --> 05:55.695
somewhere that you
can't see, so...

05:55.739 --> 05:58.000
Oh, these? Yeah.

05:58.043 --> 05:59.869
They're old NIS coveralls,

05:59.913 --> 06:01.434
blue, instead of red.

06:01.478 --> 06:03.652
They belonged to the guy that
came before me, Doc Ward.

06:03.695 --> 06:05.000
He was like a legend--
one of the main reasons

06:05.043 --> 06:06.739
that I applied for a job here.

06:06.782 --> 06:09.043
But they've been in the
closet forever, so I
figured I'd wear 'em

06:09.086 --> 06:10.956
since we're working
on an old NIS case.Excellent choice.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.347
Did you find anything?

06:12.391 --> 06:14.000
Yes.

06:14.043 --> 06:16.434
Doc's glasses.

06:16.478 --> 06:18.043
It's like I'm seeing
through his eyes.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.043
Though I... I can't really
see anything.

06:21.086 --> 06:23.043
Did you find anything
in the car?

06:23.086 --> 06:24.173
Oh. I'm getting there.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.521
Whoa, whoa.

06:26.565 --> 06:28.173
Take it easy, Magoo.

06:28.217 --> 06:29.217
Um...

06:29.260 --> 06:31.304
Doc was almost blind.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.000
So, Spears was talking
to someone on the phone

06:34.043 --> 06:35.739
when he got shot.

06:35.782 --> 06:37.304
Unfortunately,
he was talking on a burn phone

06:37.347 --> 06:39.217
as was the person
he was talking to.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.130
But save that frown,

06:41.173 --> 06:44.000
because I found this puppy
buried underneath the hood.

06:44.043 --> 06:46.043
What kind of puppy is it?

06:46.086 --> 06:50.478
It's a very sophisticated and
expensive GPS tracking puppy.

06:50.521 --> 06:51.913
It's not even available
to the public.

06:51.956 --> 06:53.000
It's used by
government agencies,

06:53.043 --> 06:54.869
foreign and domestic.

06:54.913 --> 06:59.608
Butsomeone planted it
on Spears.

06:59.652 --> 07:04.000
Butsomeone planted
it on Spears.

07:04.043 --> 07:05.478
Precisely.

07:05.521 --> 07:08.913
Who the hell is this guy?

07:08.956 --> 07:10.347
DUCKY:
Well, Leland Robert Spears.

07:10.391 --> 07:14.086
Although no one should die
in this manner,

07:14.130 --> 07:18.478
I'm glad that it's you
and not your predecessor.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.391
That makes
two of us, Duck.

07:20.434 --> 07:22.347
You find out who he really is?

07:22.391 --> 07:25.000
No. Fingerprints came back
"no-hit."

07:25.043 --> 07:28.000
We'll have to rely on DNA.

07:28.043 --> 07:29.391
Do you think this
could be connected

07:29.434 --> 07:31.086
with one of your old cases?

07:31.130 --> 07:33.043
Anything's possible.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.956
Do you ever miss
your undercover days?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.739
The adrenalin rush,

07:38.782 --> 07:43.000
the unrelenting fear of
suddenly being exposed?

07:43.043 --> 07:44.782
The real danger, Duck?

07:44.826 --> 07:47.304
Losing focus of what matters,

07:47.347 --> 07:50.869
being buried deep undercover
for too long.

07:50.913 --> 07:54.304
Losing focus of what
or whom, Jethro?

07:54.347 --> 07:56.608
I recall one case
when you had no choice

07:56.652 --> 07:59.869
but to run off to Prague
with a gorgeous redhead.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.043
[laughs]

08:01.086 --> 08:03.043
You were clearly forced

08:03.086 --> 08:04.913
to go above and beyond.

08:04.956 --> 08:07.000
Ah, no such thing.

08:07.043 --> 08:10.043
Why do you think this fellow
went to so much trouble

08:10.086 --> 08:13.347
to resurrect
your former identity?

08:21.826 --> 08:23.739
[glove snaps][sighs]

08:23.782 --> 08:26.347
I don't know if I could ever
go deep undercover.

08:26.391 --> 08:28.478
Have you ever done it?

08:28.521 --> 08:31.347
Not really. I mean,
not with a backstopped ID.

08:31.391 --> 08:34.565
Tony did once,
as Tony DiNardo.

08:34.608 --> 08:35.869
He doesn't like
to talk about it,

08:35.913 --> 08:37.739
but he actually fell in love.

08:37.782 --> 08:39.086
"Love"?

08:39.130 --> 08:41.565
Did he get... intimate?

08:41.608 --> 08:43.652
No. Tony DiNozzo didn't.

08:43.695 --> 08:45.565
Tony DiNardo did.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.521
Oh.

08:52.869 --> 08:55.913
What's this guy doing
with a black light?

08:57.521 --> 09:00.565
He's got sports memorabilia,
video games.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.130
He's like a teenage boy

09:02.173 --> 09:03.826
living in a
50-something-year-old's body.

09:03.869 --> 09:05.347
Hmm. Tom Hanks in Big.

09:05.391 --> 09:08.391
Hah. Tony would be proud
you actually saw that one.

09:08.434 --> 09:09.782
Well, half of it.

09:13.565 --> 09:16.173
Well, I got something.

09:20.608 --> 09:22.478
A security access card?

09:22.521 --> 09:25.086
Maybe Abby can figure out
what he used it for.

09:25.130 --> 09:26.869
[door rattles]

09:33.391 --> 09:35.478
Whoa!

09:36.478 --> 09:37.652
Who the hell are you?

09:37.695 --> 09:39.173
NCIS Special Agent
Timothy McGee.

09:39.217 --> 09:40.260
Who are you?

09:40.304 --> 09:42.782
Robbie Hale.
I live across the hall.

09:42.826 --> 09:45.043
Is, uh, is Leland here?

09:45.086 --> 09:46.869
When's the last time
you saw him?

09:46.913 --> 09:48.130
Last night.

09:48.173 --> 09:50.043
I mean, I didn't
actually see him,

09:50.086 --> 09:51.347
I heard him.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.652
He was in here
playing, uh,

09:52.695 --> 09:54.391
Dragon Age.

09:54.434 --> 09:55.782
My... my walls were shaking.

09:55.826 --> 09:58.869
How well do
you know him?

09:58.913 --> 10:00.956
Is Leland in some kind
of trouble?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.913
Yeah, he's dead.

10:02.956 --> 10:06.130
Wow, that's ultimate trouble.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.130
We need to ask you
some questions.

10:08.173 --> 10:09.739
Are you usually around?

10:09.782 --> 10:11.304
Yeah, man.

10:11.347 --> 10:13.521
I work out of my pad,
when I work.

10:13.565 --> 10:15.043
I'm a day-trader.

10:15.086 --> 10:16.521
Buy low, sell high.

10:16.565 --> 10:18.956
It looks like, uh, Spears
lived here alone?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.478
During the days,
at least.

10:20.521 --> 10:22.478
At night lately,
he's had what I called

10:22.521 --> 10:24.347
a barrage of bunnies.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.434
They all seemed
really smart.

10:27.478 --> 10:28.913
Do you know
where Spears worked?

10:28.956 --> 10:30.478
No, he isn't a talker.

10:30.521 --> 10:32.695
But I don't think
he was working much lately.

10:32.739 --> 10:34.130
He's been home a lot.

10:34.173 --> 10:35.434
Doing?

10:35.478 --> 10:37.043
Mostly playing
video games and

10:37.086 --> 10:39.434
listening to terrible
top-40 pop music.

10:39.478 --> 10:40.913
Miley Cyrus, One Direction,

10:40.956 --> 10:42.478
Flo-Rida.
I'm, like, "Dude,

10:42.521 --> 10:43.956
"try The Doobie Brothers,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.043
Bob Dylan,
anyone who owns a guitar."

10:47.086 --> 10:49.347
[laughs][phone beeps]

10:50.782 --> 10:53.739
Oh, man. NASDAQ--
it is dropping like a rock.

10:53.782 --> 10:57.478
I got to scoot, brother,
but, um, I'll be next door

10:57.521 --> 11:00.260
if you need me.

11:00.304 --> 11:03.478
Stock trader? Really?

11:03.521 --> 11:06.260
The times, they are a-changing.

11:06.304 --> 11:08.217
ABBY:
These are the 5.56
by 45 slugs

11:08.260 --> 11:10.652
that Ducky pulled
from Spears' body.

11:10.695 --> 11:12.869
Um, most likely
from a sniper's rifle.

11:12.913 --> 11:14.434
I ran them through NIBIN,

11:14.478 --> 11:16.956
and they don't match
any weapon anywhere.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.130
GPS tracker you found hidden
on his car tell you anything?

11:20.173 --> 11:21.869
Oh, yes, sir.

11:21.913 --> 11:23.478
It was installed a week ago,

11:23.521 --> 11:25.434
and I can tell you everywhere
that he's been.

11:25.478 --> 11:27.173
Other than his apartment,

11:27.217 --> 11:30.000
he's been to two
Washington Wizards games,

11:30.043 --> 11:32.956
three strip clubs,
and several visits

11:33.000 --> 11:35.347
to the Beltway Burger
on Phoenix Boulevard.

11:35.391 --> 11:37.434
That it?
That is not it.

11:37.478 --> 11:39.391
On Monday morning,

11:39.434 --> 11:41.043
he drove from his apartment

11:41.086 --> 11:43.739
to a remote area,
32 miles away.

11:43.782 --> 11:45.869
He stayed there
for precisely 56 minutes.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.173
Oh, what's
way out there?

11:47.217 --> 11:51.304
Trees and leaves...
and trees and leaves.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.130
Yeah, yeah,
Abbs, I get it.

11:53.173 --> 11:55.652
Pull up a satellite image.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.782
Push in on that right here.

12:02.043 --> 12:03.913
Huh. That looks like a cabin.

12:03.956 --> 12:09.217
I will have McGee
and Bishop check it out.

12:11.869 --> 12:14.521
Do you know McGee's cell number?

12:25.130 --> 12:27.565
So, I'm married.

12:27.608 --> 12:29.565
Do you think
Gibbs would still ask me

12:29.608 --> 12:32.130
to go deep undercover
for months at a time?

12:32.173 --> 12:34.173
You know, I learned
a long time ago

12:34.217 --> 12:37.086
not to try and guess
what Gibbs is gonna do.
Mm.

12:37.130 --> 12:40.304
All right, should be about
a hundred yard this way.

12:40.347 --> 12:44.869
So, hypothetically,
I'm undercover.

12:44.913 --> 12:47.521
Everything is going fine,

12:47.565 --> 12:50.260
but then, the mark hits on me.

12:50.304 --> 12:52.608
I have to make a decision.

12:52.652 --> 12:55.043
Think the key word
is "hypothetically."

12:55.086 --> 12:56.739
Gibbs hasn't asked
you to do anything.

12:56.782 --> 12:59.217
I wouldn't
worry about it.

13:02.130 --> 13:05.086
There it is.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.739
Let me try this scenario.
What if...?

13:07.782 --> 13:10.130
[explosion]

13:22.565 --> 13:25.478
If a dead dude's shed
explodes in the woods,

13:25.521 --> 13:27.478
and there's no one around
to hear it,

13:27.521 --> 13:29.000
did it make a sound?

13:29.043 --> 13:30.478
McGEE:
Bishop, you realize
if we'd arrived

13:30.521 --> 13:32.782
15 seconds earlier,
we'd both be dead.

13:32.826 --> 13:35.217
Now, aren't you glad I made you
stop for coffee, McGee?

13:35.521 --> 13:36.869
He's ventigrateful.

13:39.782 --> 13:41.782
GIBBS:
Got a DC Chronicle
sports section.

13:41.826 --> 13:43.739
September 13 last year.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.695
Hmm. Spears must have been
trekking out here for months.

13:46.739 --> 13:48.826
Maybe it's his man cave.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.391
A place
to get away from the wife.

13:50.434 --> 13:52.217
[laughing]:
In the middle of the woods?

13:54.956 --> 13:58.521
Uh, anyway, you haven't
seen his apartment.

13:58.565 --> 14:00.043
That's his man cave.

14:00.086 --> 14:02.086
And there was no evidence
of a wife.

14:02.130 --> 14:04.956
Well, Spears wasn't just
kicking it back here.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.521
He was working.

14:07.565 --> 14:08.913
TONY:
Yeah.

14:08.956 --> 14:10.652
I got a computer.

14:10.695 --> 14:12.739
What's left of one.

14:12.782 --> 14:15.000
What do you think, McGee?

14:19.608 --> 14:21.739
Looks like this was shoved
in between the cushions

14:21.782 --> 14:24.565
on the couch before
the explosion.
Oh.

14:24.608 --> 14:26.608
[camera shutter clicking]He was hiding it.

14:26.652 --> 14:29.304
From whoever left this.
McGee, come here.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.782
[clearing his throat]

14:36.826 --> 14:39.391
Here's the trigger.

14:53.478 --> 14:55.478
[door opens]

14:58.956 --> 15:00.434
I know, I know.

15:00.478 --> 15:02.652
I'm late.

15:02.695 --> 15:05.956
Punctuality was never
your main event, Tom.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.130
Punctuality is the
great thief of time.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.391
Oscar Wilde said that.

15:09.434 --> 15:11.391
Waste your time, not mine.

15:11.434 --> 15:13.217
Jackson Gibbs said that.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.217
Ah. [laughs]

15:14.260 --> 15:16.260
I liked him a lot better.

15:16.304 --> 15:18.217
[laughs]

15:18.260 --> 15:20.739
Think maybe it's time to
upgrade to a smartphone?
Yeah.

15:20.782 --> 15:22.608
You know what? I just did.

15:22.652 --> 15:25.956
Turns out, it's not
smart enough.
Ah.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.434
Good to see you, Gibbs.

15:28.478 --> 15:30.695
Or should I be
calling you Spears?

15:30.739 --> 15:34.304
Yeah. It's a flash
from the past, huh?
Yeah.

15:34.347 --> 15:36.086
A whole different life.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.521
Those early, uh,
NIS years, Tom--

15:38.565 --> 15:40.608
you sure threw us
to the wolves.

15:40.652 --> 15:44.521
Ah, but those wolves are all in
prison or dead, aren't they?

15:46.608 --> 15:49.086
What the hell's going on?

15:49.130 --> 15:51.347
I wish I knew.

15:51.391 --> 15:55.347
I'm pooling Homeland's resources
to get answers, but

15:55.391 --> 15:58.434
as of now, I'm as in
the dark as you are.

15:58.478 --> 16:00.347
What I can tell you is,

16:00.391 --> 16:03.130
someone went
to a great deal of effort

16:03.173 --> 16:05.043
to unearth your ghost.

16:05.086 --> 16:09.478
You forged
my covert identity-- Spears.

16:09.521 --> 16:11.695
When we cleared
our last investigation,

16:11.739 --> 16:14.478
you told me you burned it.

16:14.521 --> 16:16.478
Well, you're half right.

16:16.521 --> 16:19.000
I didn't invent
Leland Robert Spears.

16:20.608 --> 16:22.304
He was delivered to me.

16:22.347 --> 16:23.652
By who?

16:23.695 --> 16:25.173
Michelle Stark.

16:25.217 --> 16:28.260
She was also known in
the spook community as

16:28.304 --> 16:30.826
"The Architect,"
because, for decades,

16:30.869 --> 16:32.652
she built these intricate,

16:32.695 --> 16:35.826
untraceable
identities for the...

16:35.869 --> 16:38.173
CIA.
Yeah.

16:38.217 --> 16:40.478
Stark created
your Spears identity,

16:40.521 --> 16:43.086
along with a whole slew
of other backstopped

16:43.130 --> 16:45.130
NIS IDs for me
back in those days.

16:45.173 --> 16:46.782
She was the best.

16:46.826 --> 16:49.565
Well, she was because...
she retired a few years ago.

16:49.608 --> 16:51.304
You got an address?

16:51.347 --> 16:54.347
I'll text it to you
as soon as I get it.

16:54.391 --> 16:56.478
Thanks.

16:56.521 --> 17:00.304
That phone of yours is capable
of receiving texts, right?

17:00.347 --> 17:02.826
Oh, yeah.

17:02.869 --> 17:05.304
[chuckles]

17:05.347 --> 17:07.869
This is a vintage,
late-'30s parking timer.

17:07.913 --> 17:09.347
Swiss made, reliable.

17:09.391 --> 17:10.913
What were they for?

17:10.956 --> 17:12.652
Well, originally,

17:12.695 --> 17:15.304
to remind you to put money in
your parking meter, usually

17:15.347 --> 17:17.217
attached to a keychain,
and they could be set

17:17.260 --> 17:18.695
for up to 60 minutes.

17:18.739 --> 17:22.130
But, then, in the
'70s, terrorists

17:22.173 --> 17:24.173
from Northern Ireland
started using them

17:24.217 --> 17:26.130
as triggering
devices for IEDs.

17:26.173 --> 17:29.739
Gave the bomber time
to get away safely.
Yes.

17:29.782 --> 17:33.217
This one was connected to a
classic, black-powder pipe bomb.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.304
I can tell from
the blast pattern

17:35.347 --> 17:38.304
that the bomb was placed three
feet inside the front door.

17:38.347 --> 17:41.695
And I found traces
of alkylbenzene

17:41.739 --> 17:43.260
used as an accelerant.

17:43.304 --> 17:45.086
That's kerosene.
I know.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.173
I feel like I'm
channeling Doc Ward.

17:47.217 --> 17:49.695
Maybe it's 'cause I'm
wearing his coveralls.

17:49.739 --> 17:52.739
And he was the fire and bomb
investigative specialist.

17:52.782 --> 17:55.521
He investigated the fire
on the USS Forrestal.

17:55.565 --> 17:57.086
Really?
Mm-hmm.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.173
Oh, my father used
to talk about that all the time.

17:59.217 --> 18:01.304
So, do you think
you can channel Doc

18:01.347 --> 18:03.304
and find out
who rigged the cabin?

18:06.173 --> 18:09.217
I can certainly try.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.173
GIBBS:
Thanks for seeing us, Ms. Stark.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.695
Call me Michelle.

18:14.739 --> 18:16.347
And please, you've
made my day.

18:16.391 --> 18:19.086
Since I retired,
I've got nothing but time.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.782
You know, I thought I would do
so much, change so much.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.913
But, then, one
day I blinked,

18:24.956 --> 18:26.478
my career was winding down,

18:26.521 --> 18:29.043
and I had become the
neighborhood cat lady.

18:29.086 --> 18:31.260
Is Theodore bothering
you, Agent Gibbs?

18:31.304 --> 18:34.434
No.
Come here.
Come here.

18:34.478 --> 18:36.956
Come to Mama. Yeah,
that's a good boy.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.434
Come on, sit down.

18:39.478 --> 18:41.086
Now, listen,

18:41.130 --> 18:43.565
you're gonna be nice to those
visitors, you promise me?

18:43.608 --> 18:47.521
So, how long were you
with the CIA, Miss Stark?

18:47.565 --> 18:53.043
30 years. A lot of hard work,
made a lot of sacrifices,

18:53.086 --> 18:55.304
but loved
every minute of it.

18:55.347 --> 18:58.043
Just didn't have a lot of time
for a personal life.

18:58.086 --> 18:59.652
Don't you make that mistake,
young lady.

18:59.695 --> 19:01.869
Okay?Oh, already taken care of.

19:01.913 --> 19:04.173
[laughs]
Good for you.

19:04.217 --> 19:06.826
So, you said on the phone

19:06.869 --> 19:09.130
you wanted to talk
about a burn identity

19:09.173 --> 19:11.043
I created 20-some years ago?

19:11.086 --> 19:13.652
Leland Robert Spears?

19:16.304 --> 19:19.695
I knew you looked familiar.

19:19.739 --> 19:23.304
Remember those blue eyes
from the photo IDs I whipped up.

19:23.347 --> 19:26.086
I used to keep
the undercover persona

19:26.130 --> 19:29.391
as close as possible
to the agent adopting it.

19:29.434 --> 19:32.478
That's why Spears
was a former Marine

19:32.521 --> 19:35.478
from... Stillwater,

19:35.521 --> 19:36.956
Pennsylvania.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.739
How do you remember that?

19:38.782 --> 19:41.130
They were my creations.

19:41.173 --> 19:43.695
Does an artist forget
the details in her paintings?

19:43.739 --> 19:46.000
Certainly hope not.

19:46.043 --> 19:49.000
Well, someone's been using
my old backstopped identity.

19:49.043 --> 19:52.000
We're trying to find out
how they got it.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.043
He was murdered last night,

19:55.086 --> 19:57.913
and we have no idea
who he really is.

19:57.956 --> 20:01.043
What happens to an identity
when it's no longer being used?

20:01.086 --> 20:03.130
It's burned.

20:03.173 --> 20:06.086
Removed from everywhere

20:06.130 --> 20:09.434
except the CIA's classified,
secure network.

20:09.478 --> 20:12.217
So, it shouldn't be able
to be retrieved easily?

20:12.260 --> 20:16.000
It shouldn't be able
to be retrieved period.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.043
TONY:
No, I don't think I can, Zoe.

20:23.086 --> 20:25.521
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I just don't think I can

20:25.565 --> 20:27.869
'cause-cause we...
'cause we got a case?

20:27.913 --> 20:29.913
No, it's just
that the... the case

20:29.956 --> 20:31.739
that we're working on
is heating up,

20:31.782 --> 20:35.304
and I am probably working
tonight and tomorrow night?

20:35.347 --> 20:38.608
Yeah. You know
how it is. It's just...

20:38.652 --> 20:40.217
Yeah. Listen, I'd love to talk,

20:40.260 --> 20:43.130
but I got to go
'cause I got a thing. Mm-hmm.

20:43.173 --> 20:46.739
Yeah. Me, too. Bye.

20:46.782 --> 20:48.000
You know something
I don't?

20:48.043 --> 20:49.913
"Working tonight
and tomorrow night"?

20:49.956 --> 20:52.913
No, Tim. It's just
that Zoe's parents are in town,

20:52.956 --> 20:55.130
and they want to have dinner.

20:56.782 --> 20:58.956
I'm not ready for all that.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.956
So you deceived her?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.043
I was put on the spot.
I was not prepared.

21:03.086 --> 21:06.521
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. What are you afraid of?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.043
I don't know.

21:08.086 --> 21:09.521
They're probably really nice.

21:09.565 --> 21:10.956
I'm sure
they are.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I've just...
I've just never had dinner

21:13.043 --> 21:14.956
with the parents of a woman
I'm seriously involved with.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.086
That is not true.
What about Jeanne Benoit's?

21:17.130 --> 21:19.521
No, technically that wasn't me
because I was undercover

21:19.565 --> 21:21.913
as Tony DiNardo,
professor of film studies.

21:21.956 --> 21:23.956
I wasn't myself
back then.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.913
Meeting the parents
for dinner.

21:25.956 --> 21:28.043
That could trigger
a whole chain of events.

21:28.086 --> 21:30.695
It's just dinner, Tony.

21:30.739 --> 21:32.217
You have dinner yet
with Ranger Burt's parents?

21:32.260 --> 21:34.130
I didn't think so.
Then put down the gavel,

21:34.173 --> 21:36.913
take off the robe,
and stop judging, both of yous.

21:36.956 --> 21:39.869
Okay. Where's Gibbs?

21:39.913 --> 21:42.000
He's on his way back with
Bishop. Why? You got something?

21:42.043 --> 21:45.521
Yep. Finally broke
into a partition

21:45.565 --> 21:47.869
on Spears' laptop hard
drive. Found that he was

21:47.913 --> 21:50.347
gathering intel
on a semiconductor

21:50.391 --> 21:53.000
called Gallium Nitride.Mm.

21:53.043 --> 21:55.956
Gallium Nitride. Science-y.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.956
It's used in aerospace.
Everything from anti-radar

21:59.000 --> 22:02.043
to missile applications.
It's bad.

22:02.086 --> 22:04.304
It's, like,
really bad.

22:04.347 --> 22:06.173
Coveted by
militaries worldwide.

22:06.217 --> 22:08.869
Information you do not want
in the wrong hands.

22:08.913 --> 22:11.739
Sounds like it already is.

22:19.521 --> 22:22.478
Stolen undercover aliases
from 20 years ago

22:22.521 --> 22:25.391
I can sell to SecDef
over the phone,

22:25.434 --> 22:27.913
but advanced Gallium
Nitride in enemy hands

22:27.956 --> 22:29.043
is a different beast.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.739
Requires a house call.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.913
One that I'm not prepared
to make until we know

22:32.956 --> 22:34.608
that this is what it's about.

22:34.652 --> 22:36.000
Okay. Let's go.

22:36.043 --> 22:38.304
Uh, Gallium Nitride--
or "GaN," for short--

22:38.347 --> 22:40.869
is a highly dangerous compound
originally developed...

22:40.913 --> 22:42.173
To brighten LEDs

22:42.217 --> 22:43.652
in prototype electronics.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.869
Plasma TVs, phones.

22:46.913 --> 22:48.260
Uh... yeah.

22:48.304 --> 22:50.695
Yeah, all the electronics
we now take for granted.

22:50.739 --> 22:53.173
But the Navy...Knew that it
could have

22:53.217 --> 22:54.521
other uses.

22:54.565 --> 22:56.695
Deadly, military
uses like...

22:56.739 --> 22:58.521
radar, anti-radar

22:58.565 --> 22:59.652
or missile applications.

22:59.695 --> 23:02.391
[chuckles]What?

23:02.434 --> 23:05.000
Nothing. Except that that was...
that's a lot of technobabble,

23:05.043 --> 23:07.173
and, generally, people
with your particular hairstyle

23:07.217 --> 23:08.826
in this room don't...

23:08.869 --> 23:10.130
d-don't...

23:11.000 --> 23:14.043
Correct babble. How?

23:14.086 --> 23:17.043
I was investigating a company
doing that kind of research.

23:17.086 --> 23:19.217
Back when you were undercover
as Leland Spears.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.043
The theft of that
particular alias

23:21.086 --> 23:23.043
was intentional.

23:23.086 --> 23:25.347
This is all about
Gallium Nitride.

23:25.391 --> 23:27.043
Spears is already
in that world.

23:27.086 --> 23:30.695
Even 20 years later, it could
make intel easier to access.

23:30.739 --> 23:33.565
Depending on how deep your cover
was back then, Gibbs.

23:33.608 --> 23:36.521
MORROW:
Deep enough.

23:36.565 --> 23:40.521
Maybe it's time to pay that
visit to SecDef, Director.

23:40.565 --> 23:41.608
Yeah.

23:41.652 --> 23:43.652
Excuse me.

23:43.695 --> 23:45.434
Good to see you, sir.

23:45.478 --> 23:46.913
So what exactly

23:46.956 --> 23:48.652
was your cover on
that case, boss?

23:48.695 --> 23:49.956
Who was Leland Spears?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.695
Black market
Gallium Nitride dealer?

23:52.739 --> 23:53.782
Hit man?

23:53.826 --> 23:55.565
I.T. guy.

23:55.608 --> 23:59.304
As in "information
technology"?

23:59.347 --> 24:02.086
You-you went undercover
as a...You were a computer nerd?

24:02.130 --> 24:04.608
Computer technician.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.565
[chuckles] Right.
Of course. Technician.[chuckles, clears throat]

24:07.608 --> 24:09.739
[snorts]

24:09.782 --> 24:11.739
There a problem?

24:11.782 --> 24:13.260
No, the politically correct termNo, I just had a thing

24:13.304 --> 24:14.608
would be "computer technician."with my...

24:14.652 --> 24:16.478
How 'bout an update from Abby.

24:16.521 --> 24:18.478
Still with McGee pulling intel
from the burned drive.

24:18.521 --> 24:20.695
Maybe you could lend
a little I.T. finger.

24:20.739 --> 24:23.695
A-a hand. I meant,
like, a computer...

24:23.739 --> 24:26.173
Huh.
Hmm.

24:26.217 --> 24:28.652
McGEE:
I.T.?
As in "information technology"?

24:28.695 --> 24:32.043
Yeah. Those two words aren't
really Gibbs-compatible.

24:32.086 --> 24:34.826
Do you think he's just been
putting us on this whole time?

24:34.869 --> 24:36.913
What, you mean
Gibbs' techno-aversion is fake

24:36.956 --> 24:39.086
and he's secretly known
about computers all this time?

24:39.130 --> 24:40.521
No. No way.

24:40.565 --> 24:44.130
Well, he had to know
about computers back then.

24:44.173 --> 24:45.739
What makes you say that?

24:45.782 --> 24:47.347
GIBBS:
I didn't blow my cover.

24:47.391 --> 24:49.130
Uh, of course you didn't, boss.

24:49.173 --> 24:52.956
I'm-I'm sure you made
a very convincing computer nerd.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.130
Computer technician.

24:55.347 --> 24:57.478
Okay. Moving on.

24:57.521 --> 24:59.478
We found
your former undercover ID

24:59.521 --> 25:02.956
on the burned-out hard drive.
Spears was using your old name

25:03.000 --> 25:06.565
and background info to pose
as a seasoned I.T. guy.

25:06.608 --> 25:08.608
He took a part-time
tech support job

25:08.652 --> 25:10.043
at Longview Technics.

25:10.086 --> 25:11.826
It's an advanced
research company.

25:11.869 --> 25:14.695
Which just happens
to use Gallium Nitride.

25:14.739 --> 25:16.086
Spears wasn't fixing computers.

25:16.130 --> 25:18.695
No. He was using
them to steal data.

25:18.739 --> 25:20.043
Could be what got him killed.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.608
Find out.

25:21.652 --> 25:24.217
Well, we'd have
to access Longview's

25:24.260 --> 25:25.652
network file storage,

25:25.695 --> 25:27.478
something they're not
gonna be eager to share.

25:27.521 --> 25:30.608
So how do we see
what Spears was accessing

25:30.652 --> 25:31.608
without raising any eyebrows?

25:31.652 --> 25:33.739
We show up to work.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.695
You mean we pose as Spears?

25:35.739 --> 25:38.565
Company doesn't know
he's dead.

25:38.608 --> 25:40.260
So we can go in
during the night shift--

25:40.304 --> 25:41.956
after-hours, less people,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.652
hopefully no familiar faces.
We can access their network

25:44.695 --> 25:46.739
and find out
what Spears was downloading.

25:46.782 --> 25:48.869
In and out.
15 minutes tops.I already have

25:48.913 --> 25:51.608
Spears' access card scanned
on my computer.

25:51.652 --> 25:54.173
McGEE:
All right,
all we need is a photo.

25:54.217 --> 25:56.000
My NCIS ID should be
scanned into the system,

25:56.043 --> 25:57.521
so you can just
copy and paste.

25:57.565 --> 25:59.086
Nope. I don't need yours.

26:00.521 --> 26:03.043
W-We're not sending
Gibbs undercover.

26:03.086 --> 26:04.608
No offense, boss.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.521
No, none taken, McGee. I agree.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.130
We send McGee.No.

26:09.173 --> 26:12.913
If we send in McGee, names,
dates, nothing will match.

26:12.956 --> 26:15.565
I'll have to change everything.
This is faster and smarter.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.913
It was your identity
in the first place, Gibbs.

26:18.956 --> 26:20.521
You made it work
back then.I studied.

26:20.565 --> 26:21.695
Perfect.

26:21.739 --> 26:24.434
Technology may be faster
and smaller,

26:24.478 --> 26:27.652
but, in truth,
nothing's changed that much.

26:27.695 --> 26:31.652
You don't need McGee.

26:31.695 --> 26:35.608
C-colon-slashback still apply?

26:37.565 --> 26:40.173
McGEE:
Okay, we've got good video.

26:40.217 --> 26:43.173
Testing. Testing. Come in, boss.

26:43.217 --> 26:46.956
Relax, McGee. It's not NASA.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.652
McGEE [over earpiece]:
Okay, the night staff should be
the only ones in the building.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.956
You have Spears' badge,
which should give you access

26:52.000 --> 26:53.913
to the lobby elevators.

26:53.956 --> 26:55.695
Can I help you?

26:55.739 --> 26:56.869
Let's just hope
that security guard doesn't know

26:56.913 --> 26:57.869
Spears personally.

26:57.913 --> 26:59.565
I.T. guy.

26:59.608 --> 27:02.739
Got to go up to my office.
Fifth floor.

27:16.043 --> 27:19.565
Uh, maybe the card has
to touch the sensor.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.304
Having trouble?

27:23.347 --> 27:25.478
I thought you were supposed
to be fixing these things.

27:25.521 --> 27:28.130
Okay, tell him that there's
probably a malfunction

27:28.173 --> 27:30.826
with the proximity sensor and
that you'll have to come back

27:30.869 --> 27:33.043
tomorrow with a new
RFID reader.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.565
Not my department.

27:34.608 --> 27:37.043
Mind if I ask
what you're doing here then?

27:37.086 --> 27:39.217
You're here to reboot
network protocols,

27:39.260 --> 27:42.173
which will shut the Internet
access off completely.

27:42.217 --> 27:44.478
That's why you have to come
during off-hours.Not a clue.

27:44.521 --> 27:45.826
My boss e-mails me
in the middle of the night,

27:45.869 --> 27:48.217
I shut up and I show up.

27:48.260 --> 27:50.695
He's not saying
anything that I'm saying.

27:50.739 --> 27:52.434
Mind if I see that e-mail?

27:52.478 --> 27:54.217
No, boss, we don't have that.

27:54.260 --> 27:56.217
We don't have the e-mail.
What's he gonna show him?

27:56.260 --> 27:59.913
I don't know. His gun?
His badge? Worse? I don't know.

27:59.956 --> 28:03.521
Sure. No problem. You're welcome
to anything on there.Wh...

28:07.173 --> 28:10.695
Did I mention that
my boss woke me up?

28:10.739 --> 28:13.869
[chuckles]
You're telling me.[chuckles]

28:13.913 --> 28:16.086
They say, "Jump."
You say, "How high?"

28:16.130 --> 28:17.304
I'm right there with you.

28:20.086 --> 28:21.565
[sighs]

28:25.173 --> 28:26.521
Don't work too hard now.

28:26.565 --> 28:29.521
[chuckles]
Yeah. Maybe in another life.

28:32.608 --> 28:35.434
[sighs]

28:37.521 --> 28:40.478
McGEE:
Well, at least the card reader
problem wasn't system-wide.

28:40.521 --> 28:42.739
Does it matter which computer?

28:42.782 --> 28:45.043
Well, you have Spears'
username and password,

28:45.086 --> 28:48.217
so you should be able to sign in
using any networked computer.

28:53.347 --> 28:57.347
Okay, so, uh,
open the log-in menu.

28:58.347 --> 29:00.565
Okay. How?

29:00.608 --> 29:02.782
Uh, tap the keyboard.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.347
Then say that, McGee.

29:05.391 --> 29:07.782
Uh, sorry, boss. You weren't
listening to me in the lobby.

29:07.826 --> 29:10.000
I figured you knew
what you were doing.

29:10.043 --> 29:13.260
With people, McGee.
Not computers.

29:13.304 --> 29:14.956
Okay. Go slowly.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.391
Enter the username and password.

29:18.434 --> 29:20.000
You still think this was faster?

29:20.043 --> 29:22.956
All we have to do is walk him
through accessing

29:23.000 --> 29:25.347
Spears' log-in history,
recording the download records,

29:25.391 --> 29:27.260
and mirroring
the files.

29:27.304 --> 29:28.434
It'll be a piece of cake.

29:28.478 --> 29:29.521
Where the hell is
the caps lock?

29:33.739 --> 29:36.217
[sighs]

29:38.391 --> 29:39.782
[elevator doors opening]

29:41.391 --> 29:43.130
Morning, sunshine.

29:43.173 --> 29:44.956
You been up there a while.
Everything all right?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.956
[chuckles]

29:47.000 --> 29:49.913
Oh, I hate computers.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.304
[chuckles]
You're a funny guy.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.000
I hear you.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.739
It took you four hours?

30:02.782 --> 30:04.869
Yeah. Gibbs is
a hunt-and-pecker.

30:04.913 --> 30:06.608
BISHOP:
Anything stand out?

30:06.652 --> 30:10.086
Confirmation that Spears did
steal data on Gallium Nitride.

30:10.130 --> 30:12.086
BISHOP:
Mmm. Bad but not surprising.

30:12.130 --> 30:14.043
McGEE:
This is.

30:14.086 --> 30:17.869
According to the user log Gibbs
downloaded-- that's just odd--

30:17.913 --> 30:21.173
Spears used company computers
to transfer several documents

30:21.217 --> 30:23.652
to a second party
using FTP software.

30:23.695 --> 30:26.391
TONY:
Name?No names. Just an FTP site.

30:26.434 --> 30:29.173
A traceable one?It's secured,

30:29.217 --> 30:32.391
but now that I'm
on the keyboard, yes.

30:34.173 --> 30:35.826
Federal agents!

30:35.869 --> 30:37.217
NCIS!

30:46.260 --> 30:47.565
TONY:
Clear.

30:47.608 --> 30:49.565
McGEE: Clear.

30:52.173 --> 30:55.478
And clean.

31:00.782 --> 31:03.173
Too clean.

31:03.217 --> 31:05.043
Like it hasn't
even been lived in.

31:05.086 --> 31:06.695
Dead end?

31:06.739 --> 31:08.173
Another safe house?

31:08.217 --> 31:09.565
GIBBS:
Both.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.347
Call Ducky.

31:20.391 --> 31:21.565
Another execution?

31:21.608 --> 31:23.478
BISHOP:
Another spy?

31:23.521 --> 31:25.347
I wonder who this John Doe is.

31:26.695 --> 31:27.739
Got junk mail.

31:27.782 --> 31:29.217
Name's not John.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.043
It's Edgar.

31:31.086 --> 31:32.826
Edgar Bron?

31:35.130 --> 31:37.043
Another
undercover alias?

31:37.086 --> 31:39.000
Spears was created
for you, Gibbs.

31:39.043 --> 31:41.086
Who used that name?

31:41.130 --> 31:43.347
Mike Franks.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.695
No hits on any
facial-recognition databases.

31:54.739 --> 31:56.869
Fingerprints?
Nothing.

31:56.913 --> 32:00.782
Spears was sending this guy
information on Gallium Nitride.

32:01.347 --> 32:02.956
Were they spies?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.869
They were using fake IDs.

32:04.913 --> 32:06.434
Well, these two don't have much
in common, boss.

32:06.478 --> 32:08.434
Bron's place appears to have

32:08.478 --> 32:11.173
hardly been lived in,
practically staged.

32:11.217 --> 32:12.565
Whereas Spears' apartment looks

32:12.608 --> 32:14.130
like an overgrown
frat boy's man cave.

32:14.173 --> 32:15.782
TONY:
All the makings of a cover.

32:15.826 --> 32:17.347
Wait. Stop. Go back.

32:18.695 --> 32:20.260
There.

32:20.304 --> 32:22.782
Spears had tattoo magazines
all over the place.

32:22.826 --> 32:25.043
He had dozens of books
marked on the subject,

32:25.086 --> 32:26.608
yet he didn't have
a tattoo himself.

32:26.652 --> 32:28.043
That's weird.

32:28.086 --> 32:31.391
Bishop, go get
your BLUESTAR kit.

32:31.434 --> 32:32.913
What are you thinking?

32:32.956 --> 32:36.043
McGee, find out everything
you can on a Miranda Flemming.

32:36.086 --> 32:37.043
Who's that?

32:37.086 --> 32:39.913
Just do it, huh?

32:39.956 --> 32:42.130
Anyone have a clue?

32:42.173 --> 32:45.086
Nada. No sé.Hmm.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.217
Hey, Duck?

32:48.260 --> 32:50.739
Spears-- I need to see him.

32:50.782 --> 32:52.956
Yes. [chuckles]

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
I can see you do.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
GIBBS:
No tattoos.

33:02.043 --> 33:03.695
Correct.

33:03.739 --> 33:05.043
What about the other side?

33:05.086 --> 33:06.695
No, none
there, either.

33:08.043 --> 33:09.652
Maybe.

33:09.695 --> 33:13.478
Maybe? Is your gut telling
you something, Jethro?

33:18.956 --> 33:20.826
Ultraviolet tattoo.

33:20.869 --> 33:24.695
Well, that explains why we found
a black light in his apartment.

33:28.434 --> 33:32.000
[Ducky speaking Serbian]

33:33.304 --> 33:35.304
That's Serbian.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.130
GIBBS:
"For king and fatherland."Yeah.

33:38.173 --> 33:42.260
"Freedom or death."

33:42.304 --> 33:44.956
MICHELLE:
So another identity
has been compromised?

33:45.000 --> 33:48.695
We have reason to believe both
Spears and Bron were Serbian.

33:48.739 --> 33:50.608
What was Franks' role
in the original mission?

33:50.652 --> 33:52.869
I seem to recall
backstopping him as a...

33:52.913 --> 33:54.739
Bartender.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.869
He was identifying
possible suspects we thought

33:56.913 --> 33:59.608
were trying to sell intel
to the Serbians.

33:59.652 --> 34:01.956
Can't be a coincidence.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.913
Serbians then, Serbians now.

34:03.956 --> 34:05.739
Oh, it was all smoke,

34:05.782 --> 34:07.739
no fire then, so
we closed it down.

34:07.782 --> 34:09.739
Someone reopened it.

34:09.782 --> 34:12.478
These victims have
real identities.

34:12.521 --> 34:14.478
We need to find
out who they were.

34:14.521 --> 34:17.043
[knocking]
Yeah?

34:17.086 --> 34:20.695
Boss.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.782
Got something?

34:26.826 --> 34:28.608
There was another agent
working undercover

34:28.652 --> 34:30.173
with Mike Franks and me.

34:30.217 --> 34:32.304
Jenny Shepard.

34:32.347 --> 34:33.869
Yeah.

34:33.913 --> 34:38.826
Yeah, her backstopped name
was Miranda Flemming.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.086
You remember that
name, Michelle?

34:40.130 --> 34:41.521
Yes, I do.

34:41.565 --> 34:42.782
I asked McGee to find out

34:42.826 --> 34:44.173
if there were any
current hits on her.

34:44.217 --> 34:45.608
Tim, why don't you
tell them

34:45.652 --> 34:46.913
what she's been doing?

34:46.956 --> 34:50.000
Well, Miranda Flemming
is alive and well.

34:50.043 --> 34:51.521
In fact, she has
a flight booked

34:51.565 --> 34:52.869
to Buenos Aires
tomorrow morning.

34:52.913 --> 34:54.826
MORROW:
So,

34:54.869 --> 34:57.347
we pick her up at the airport.

34:57.391 --> 34:59.217
I don't think we're gonna
have to wait that long.

35:06.956 --> 35:09.652
MORROW:
But you were so good
at what you did.

35:11.826 --> 35:14.521
Worked so hard
with such dedication.

35:14.565 --> 35:16.826
Why would you turn
on the agency?

35:18.869 --> 35:21.869
I didn't turn on the agency.

35:21.913 --> 35:24.478
I gave my life to it.

35:25.739 --> 35:28.130
And I was pushed out.

35:28.173 --> 35:30.608
Mandatory retirement.

35:30.652 --> 35:33.608
What else was I gonna do?

35:33.652 --> 35:36.782
There's not much use
for my unique talents

35:36.826 --> 35:38.652
in the private sector.

35:38.695 --> 35:40.826
Did you approach the Serbians?

35:40.869 --> 35:42.956
No.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.347
They approached me.

35:44.391 --> 35:45.695
Who?

35:45.739 --> 35:48.000
An attaché from
their embassy.

35:48.043 --> 35:52.434
He offered me a lot of money
for two backstopped IDs.

35:52.478 --> 35:54.826
Did they say what
they wanted them for?

35:54.869 --> 35:59.304
They were trying to get
information on Gallium Nitride.

35:59.347 --> 36:02.086
That's old stuff.

36:02.130 --> 36:04.608
What could it hurt?

36:05.869 --> 36:09.304
Guys you backstopped
are dead.

36:09.347 --> 36:12.000
Did you deal
with either of them?

36:12.043 --> 36:14.782
No. Only their handler.

36:14.826 --> 36:16.913
Okay. Who?

36:16.956 --> 36:19.260
I have no idea.

36:19.304 --> 36:22.130
We communicated
by encrypted mail.

36:22.173 --> 36:27.260
Last time I heard
from him... or her,

36:27.304 --> 36:30.478
they were shutting
the operation down.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.695
Leland Spears
was getting sloppy.

36:33.739 --> 36:36.130
We saw his apartment.

36:36.173 --> 36:39.217
He was going American
on them.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.260
They probably thought
he was going to defect.

36:41.304 --> 36:43.391
So, they killed him.

36:43.434 --> 36:45.652
Believe me,

36:45.695 --> 36:47.695
I didn't know that.

36:49.913 --> 36:52.826
What happens next?

36:52.869 --> 36:55.173
You help us, and
you help yourself.

36:56.478 --> 36:58.347
What do you want me to do?

36:58.391 --> 37:00.782
E-mail the handler.

37:00.826 --> 37:02.608
Tell them

37:02.652 --> 37:04.956
that Edgar Bron didn't die, that

37:05.000 --> 37:07.695
he's on life support
at Washington General,

37:07.739 --> 37:10.782
and he's expected
to pull through.

37:30.217 --> 37:32.695
My, Grandma,

37:32.739 --> 37:34.826
what big eyes you have.McGEE:
Tony, cut it out,

37:34.869 --> 37:36.869
or I'll strangle you
with my big hands.

37:36.913 --> 37:39.000
You're grouchy.
Well,

37:39.043 --> 37:41.043
what do you expect?
This is a waste of time.

37:41.086 --> 37:43.608
No one's coming here, and I have
to go to the bathroom.

37:43.652 --> 37:45.217
Oh, okay, I'll get you a nurse.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.173
She'll put a catheter in you.Hey!

37:47.217 --> 37:50.000
Get back here!
Get that stuff off of me!

37:50.043 --> 37:51.695
The patient's getting restless.

37:51.739 --> 37:53.000
I don't blame him.

37:53.043 --> 37:54.608
How much longer
are we gonna do this?

37:54.652 --> 37:56.347
I'll find out. Hey, boss?

37:56.391 --> 37:58.869
Yes, I heard.
McGee is getting restless.

37:58.913 --> 38:00.391
He'll be fine, but...

38:00.434 --> 38:02.173
Ah, let's give him a break.

38:02.217 --> 38:04.217
Your turn, DiNozzo.
Go, get in bed.

38:04.260 --> 38:06.739
Go on.[fire alarm sounding]

38:07.652 --> 38:09.130
What's going on?

38:09.173 --> 38:12.478
Fire alarm, this floor,
other end of the corridor.

38:12.521 --> 38:15.608
Check out the alarm.
Bishop, stay there with him.

38:23.695 --> 38:26.608
Uh... what are you doing?

38:26.652 --> 38:27.913
Uh, prepping the
patient for evacuation.

38:27.956 --> 38:29.434
You need to get back
to your station.

38:29.478 --> 38:31.913
It's Hale.
Spears' neighbor.

38:31.956 --> 38:33.913
Freeze!

38:33.956 --> 38:35.434
[grunting]

38:35.478 --> 38:36.913
[loud grunting]

38:36.956 --> 38:39.434
[grunting, panting]

38:50.739 --> 38:53.043
[door closing]

38:53.086 --> 38:55.608
Who is this guy?

38:55.652 --> 38:57.391
Name is Robbie Hale.

38:57.434 --> 38:59.956
He's the Serbian handler?Yup.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.869
MORROW:
Just showed up at the hospital.

39:01.913 --> 39:03.434
With a hypodermic needle.

39:03.478 --> 39:05.260
He was gonna jab it
into my little buddy.

39:05.304 --> 39:07.000
We haven't tested
the hypodermic yet, but...

39:07.043 --> 39:09.347
HALE [groaning]:
You can't just keep me in here!

39:09.391 --> 39:11.608
...Hale says that it was full
of potassium chloride.

39:11.652 --> 39:13.739
Would have given me
a heart attack.

39:13.782 --> 39:15.608
How did you get him
to offer that up?

39:15.652 --> 39:17.869
We beat it out of him.No, we didn't.

39:17.913 --> 39:19.739
No, we didn't.He talked freely.
He doesn't care what we know.

39:19.782 --> 39:22.043
He claims
that he has diplomatic immunity.

39:22.086 --> 39:24.608
Where is Gibbs?He's in MTAC,

39:24.652 --> 39:26.869
talking to the State
Department's Operations Desk.

39:26.913 --> 39:29.217
So, was this guy on your radar?

39:29.260 --> 39:30.956
Bishop and I questioned him.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.956
He lived next door to Spears.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.434
Once we got
him back here,

39:34.478 --> 39:36.043
he told us he moved
in a few weeks ago

39:36.086 --> 39:37.521
to keep tabs on him,
and he admitted

39:37.565 --> 39:39.086
to putting the bug
on Spears' car.

39:39.130 --> 39:42.478
So, did Hale confess
to the murders?
He did.

39:42.521 --> 39:45.000
What was his motive?That they finished their mission

39:45.043 --> 39:46.826
and were supposed
to return home to Serbia.

39:46.869 --> 39:50.304
HALE:
Is anybody in there?
Anybody at all? Huh?

39:50.347 --> 39:53.173
Tom?
What did
State say?

39:53.217 --> 39:55.521
They have no record of Hale
being registered as a member

39:55.565 --> 39:58.695
of the Republic of Serbia's
diplomatic mission.

39:58.739 --> 40:00.130
He may be working for them,

40:00.173 --> 40:03.739
but he has no right
to diplomatic immunity.

40:03.782 --> 40:06.478
HALE:
Are you deaf?!

40:06.521 --> 40:09.000
I know you can see me!MORROW: We'll take care
of him from here.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.347
Been a long day, folks.

40:16.391 --> 40:18.695
Get some sleep. We'll do
the paperwork in the morning.

40:18.739 --> 40:21.956
Great! Ah, fantastic. You know,
there's a midnight showing

40:22.000 --> 40:24.130
of one of my favorite films
over at the art house.

40:24.173 --> 40:25.869
Huh? What's that?

40:25.913 --> 40:27.434
[a lá Don LaFontaine]:
In a world weary of war,

40:27.478 --> 40:30.521
there was one man
who didn't care.

40:30.565 --> 40:32.130
He was a soldier
of glory.

40:32.173 --> 40:34.391
Oh, I'm in. I am in.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.478
Hmm. Don't rush.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.652
First half sucks.

40:39.695 --> 40:41.521
Huh.

40:41.565 --> 40:45.956
All right, we'll see you
tomorrow, film critic.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.043
Huh.

40:50.347 --> 40:53.391
You need something, Bishop.

40:53.434 --> 40:56.391
Nope, I'm all good.

40:56.434 --> 40:58.000
Wasn't a question.

41:04.521 --> 41:09.217
Deep undercover work,
like Tony did years ago,

41:09.260 --> 41:13.173
hypothetically, would you ever
put me in that position?

41:14.217 --> 41:17.043
That's tough to answer.

41:17.086 --> 41:20.086
I'm only saying, I...
I know the big picture,

41:20.130 --> 41:23.043
and eventually,
everyone's time comes,

41:23.086 --> 41:26.086
and I understand
and accept that.

41:26.130 --> 41:28.434
Forget the big picture.

41:30.608 --> 41:32.913
Look at everything close up.

41:32.956 --> 41:36.086
Do you think
that working undercover

41:36.130 --> 41:38.217
for so long
affected your marriage?

41:42.521 --> 41:45.304
Go home to Jake, Bishop.
