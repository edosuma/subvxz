WEBVTT

00:06.549 --> 00:07.509
Wow!

00:07.592 --> 00:09.427
Oh, Janet!

00:09.469 --> 00:11.387
You did it! You brought us into your void!

00:11.554 --> 00:13.807
- If I had a heart, it would be pounding!
- Michael--

00:13.890 --> 00:17.435
You'd think there'd be side effects, but...
I feel great.

00:17.477 --> 00:19.020
How's the hair? Is it still amazing?

00:19.104 --> 00:22.607
Michael, there may have been some
side effects for the humans.

00:24.859 --> 00:25.735
Huh.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.197
Dude. Why are there so many Janets?

00:29.280 --> 00:33.034
- And why do I sound like Janet?
- You also look like Janet.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.160
Do I?

00:34.536 --> 00:36.454
Why? What?

00:37.038 --> 00:40.375
What is happening?

00:40.750 --> 00:41.793
Oh, no.

00:41.835 --> 00:42.710
Am I...

00:43.253 --> 00:44.879
wearing a vest?

00:45.255 --> 00:47.257
Ooh! Michael, help me!

00:47.382 --> 00:50.468
This is gonna be tricky.
How do we even tell them apart?

00:50.927 --> 00:53.221
Oh!

00:53.596 --> 00:55.473
OK. That one's Jason.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.190
I can't put the humans back
in their own bodies

01:04.232 --> 01:07.527
so I've done the next best,
but still not that great, thing!

01:08.278 --> 01:10.238
A high-neck sleeveless?

01:10.572 --> 01:12.448
I suppose this outfit will do.

01:12.532 --> 01:16.703
Are you sure? I mean,
wearing a floral print to an infinite void

01:16.828 --> 01:18.621
at this time of the nothing?

01:18.830 --> 01:21.040
So, where are we, exactly?

01:21.124 --> 01:24.419
- We're not on Earth, right?
- That's correct, Chidi-Janet, you're not.

01:24.586 --> 01:27.422
Your real bodies dematerialised
when you entered my void

01:27.463 --> 01:31.384
and your essences reconstituted themselves
in this form.

01:31.467 --> 01:32.760
Cool, cool.

01:32.844 --> 01:34.846
And when you say "void"...?

01:34.929 --> 01:37.432
Oh, I mean a sub-dimension
outside of space and time

01:37.473 --> 01:41.060
at the nexus of consciousness and matter,
tethered to my essence.

01:41.186 --> 01:42.103
Does that help?

01:42.145 --> 01:43.438
It does <i>not</i> help.

01:43.521 --> 01:44.981
Makes it way worse.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.567
I just wanna lie down.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.028
Where is down?

01:50.111 --> 01:52.113
I found it! It's up here.

01:52.405 --> 01:53.531
It's dope!

01:54.032 --> 01:55.700
I have an idea.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.493
Sweet! I call sofa!

01:57.577 --> 02:00.538
Janet's void has a back door
to the Janet Warehouse

02:00.580 --> 02:03.833
in the Neutral Zone,
which is right near Accounting.

02:03.958 --> 02:08.504
You four will stay here
while actual Janet and I sneak through it

02:08.630 --> 02:12.091
- and find the Head Accountant.
- But Michael, why can't we go with you?

02:12.175 --> 02:15.136
Well, you just "died," which means
you're the first humans in history

02:15.178 --> 02:17.472
to not immediately
go to the Good or Bad Place

02:17.513 --> 02:20.808
which in turn makes you
interdimensional fugitives.

02:20.934 --> 02:22.143
So, that's neat.

02:22.227 --> 02:25.563
Also the Judge is probably
still pissed at me for, you know

02:25.647 --> 02:28.191
breaking all the rules,
and she might take it out on you.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.152
Plus, the Bad Place
is probably hunting for us.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.322
So, literally the entire universe
is against you.

02:34.364 --> 02:36.199
OK, but what's a fourth really good reason?

02:37.700 --> 02:40.370
Jeez. Just trying to lighten the mood.
Tough void.

02:40.453 --> 02:43.623
Now, Janet and I will pose
as Good Place employees

02:43.665 --> 02:46.251
and sweet-talk the Accountant
into showing us his books.

02:46.501 --> 02:51.589
If I'm right, we will find proof
that the Bad Place is tampering

02:51.714 --> 02:52.882
with the points system.

02:53.091 --> 02:55.760
The Accountant will tell us what to do,
and this will all be over.

02:55.802 --> 02:57.679
We're almost at the end, guys.

02:57.762 --> 03:01.307
Just stay here and keep Janets' heads
on straight.

03:01.516 --> 03:03.518
Bye!

03:05.979 --> 03:08.231
Is that a Good Janet or a Bad Janet?

03:08.314 --> 03:09.482
That's a Neutral Janet.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.609
She's sort of the black sheep
of the Janet world.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.569
Or the blank sheep, I guess.

03:13.611 --> 03:16.197
Ooh, I can throw shade now! That's cool!

03:17.740 --> 03:19.450
You've arrived at the Accounting office.

03:19.492 --> 03:22.745
All point calculations for actions
taken on Earth are made here.

03:22.829 --> 03:25.290
- End of conversation.
- My name is Michael.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.918
I need to speak with the Head Accountant,
on official Good Place business.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.296
I will inform the Head Accountant
of your presence

03:31.337 --> 03:34.382
and he either will or will not see you
in a certain amount of time.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.009
End of conversation.

03:36.843 --> 03:37.802
Wow.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.849
Good thing your "void"
plan worked out, huh?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.521
<i>♪ ...believe in life after love? ♪</i>

03:49.147 --> 03:50.106
Oh...

03:50.398 --> 03:52.775
having four humans in my void is weird.

03:52.984 --> 03:53.860
Ah.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.570
This is nuts.

03:55.862 --> 03:58.781
We're in a void,
in the body of a white lady...

03:58.865 --> 04:00.241
- Not a lady.
- Not a lady, darling.

04:00.325 --> 04:01.284
But we are white!

04:01.409 --> 04:03.077
Let's all say white people things!

04:03.161 --> 04:04.120
"Billy Joel!"

04:04.245 --> 04:05.538
"I found it on Etsy."

04:05.705 --> 04:07.040
"There was nowhere to park!"

04:07.165 --> 04:08.624
"Did you refill the Brita?"

04:08.791 --> 04:10.626
I find this void quite calming, actually.

04:10.793 --> 04:14.339
It's like, this time, the Xanax took me.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.840
Oh, I have the worst stomach ache.

04:16.049 --> 04:17.467
Dude, relax.

04:18.176 --> 04:20.303
Here, let me see if I
can figure this out...

04:20.970 --> 04:23.181
Oh!

04:23.222 --> 04:25.767
Wow, Eleanor! How'd you do that?

04:25.850 --> 04:27.310
I dunno. We're Janets now.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.395
So, I thought we'd have some bitchin'
Janet powers.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.731
What just happened? What did you do?

04:31.856 --> 04:33.941
Sorry, I'm just trying to help Chidi calm--

04:33.983 --> 04:36.611
The structural integrity of this void
is already at risk.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.905
You can't start
randomly conjuring up objects.

04:39.030 --> 04:40.865
Or it might shatter the void!

04:40.948 --> 04:42.116
Yes, it might!

04:42.283 --> 04:45.411
It might make everything blow up
and we'll all disappear forever!

04:45.495 --> 04:46.371
Mwah!

04:46.496 --> 04:47.955
So, stop it!

04:52.335 --> 04:53.628
Everything OK?

04:53.878 --> 04:54.754
Nope!

04:54.837 --> 04:57.507
- Well...
- The Head Accountant
has decided to see you.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.259
This will happen now. End of conversation.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.303
Hi.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.430
Hey-oh!

05:04.472 --> 05:06.057
Ha, there they are. Good to see you.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.601
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Neil, Head Accountant.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.561
You must be Janet and Michael.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.063
Yes.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.399
Can I just say,
I really depreciate you coming.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.819
Eh? Little bit of Accounting humour.

05:17.902 --> 05:18.945
- Ha!
- Yeah.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.740
- So, what can I do for you?
- Well, I'm concerned about certain...

05:22.782 --> 05:24.700
anomalies, in the points system.

05:24.742 --> 05:28.496
I'm worried that somehow,
the Bad Place has been tampering.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.832
Tampering? No, no, no. Quite impossible.

05:31.082 --> 05:32.041
Laughable, really.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.168
Janet, can you remind me
to laugh at that later?

05:34.252 --> 05:37.296
Your amusement has been scheduled.
End of conversation.

05:38.714 --> 05:39.841
She's a lot of fun.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.051
Could you just humour us though?

05:42.427 --> 05:45.138
- Show us how the system works?
- Uh...

05:45.221 --> 05:46.973
well, I suppose I could give you
a quick tour.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.350
We don't get a lot of visitors. Follow me.

05:50.476 --> 05:54.397
Eleanor! How'd you know I always
wanted a dog like this?

05:54.814 --> 05:58.401
Funny story, it's one of the things I saw
in the alternate timeline

05:58.443 --> 06:02.155
where we were soulmates on and off
for 300 years.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.617
- Maybe we should talk about that?
- Well, I... suppose we can

06:06.659 --> 06:09.036
but there's not that much to talk about.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.332
The things you saw weren't part of my life,
so they didn't happen to me.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.669
The hell are you talking about, man?
Of course it was you. I saw it.

06:16.711 --> 06:20.006
Well, it was a Chidi, sure,
but it wasn't me Chidi.

06:20.339 --> 06:23.426
This is a classic philosophical question,
the concept of "the self"

06:23.468 --> 06:24.427
or "who we are"

06:24.469 --> 06:28.014
philosophically speaking,
there's the Chidi I am

06:28.055 --> 06:31.100
who lived a certain life,
and there's the Chidi you saw

06:31.184 --> 06:36.022
your soulmate, or whatever,
who had some entirely different life.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.149
Not the same Chidis.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.276
I'm so sorry. Yeah, no, I get it.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.029
Counterpoint, that's the dumbest thing
you've ever said

06:43.070 --> 06:45.448
and you do not deserve a puppy!
I'm un-blooping your puppy!

06:49.243 --> 06:51.871
Things are getting cuter
and I want them to get less cute!

06:57.502 --> 06:59.587
So, this is the main feed.

06:59.879 --> 07:02.006
Every action, by every human on Earth

07:02.048 --> 07:05.551
is recorded and then sent here
to be assigned a point value

07:05.635 --> 07:08.179
based on the absolute moral worth
of that action.

07:08.346 --> 07:12.767
For example, a couple in Osaka, Japan
just decided to have a destination wedding.

07:13.059 --> 07:14.393
Negative 1,200 points.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.730
Oh, and it's a destination theme wedding.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.148
Negative 4,300.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.444
The theme's <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
They're basically doomed.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.029
Ah! Here's fun.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.658
This means that someone has just done
something which has never been done before.

07:29.075 --> 07:33.287
Richard Moore of Sugarland Texas,
hollowed out an eggplant

07:33.371 --> 07:36.249
and filled it with hot sauce and nickels.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.751
And amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing!

07:38.793 --> 07:42.004
99% percent of all new human behaviours
are weird sex things

07:42.046 --> 07:44.215
but not in this...
oh, no it is a weird sex thing.

07:44.423 --> 07:47.051
Well, then we zip that over
to the relevant departments.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.595
In this case, Anastasia
in the Stuffed Vegetable Department

07:50.012 --> 07:52.098
we've got Hector over in American Coins

07:52.181 --> 07:54.517
and my dear buddy Matt,
in Weird Sex Things.

07:54.934 --> 07:57.436
I'm still waiting on a response
to the request I filed

07:57.520 --> 07:58.896
for immediate suicide?

07:59.063 --> 08:00.273
Request denied.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.567
I love Matty! He's hilarious.

08:02.608 --> 08:07.071
So, they now examine the action,
its use of resources

08:07.154 --> 08:08.906
the intentions behind it

08:09.282 --> 08:13.411
- its effects on others...
- Correct, and you end up with this.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.289
And here is why tampering is impossible.

08:16.330 --> 08:20.459
Because this score is then double-checked
by three billion other accountants

08:20.585 --> 08:21.752
all chosen at random

08:21.919 --> 08:25.756
and if they all come to the same conclusion,
which they always do

08:25.798 --> 08:26.924
it makes this official.

08:27.008 --> 08:29.176
Anyone who does this same action
in the exact same way

08:29.343 --> 08:30.720
loses this many points.

08:30.970 --> 08:34.473
When people die, their biographical history
and final point totals

08:34.515 --> 08:36.183
are sent to the relevant destination.

08:36.267 --> 08:38.102
This batch is going to the Bad Place.

08:38.603 --> 08:40.062
Thank you, Doris.

08:42.148 --> 08:44.817
The system is flawless
and tampering is quite impossible.

08:44.900 --> 08:49.864
I see. Could we look at one specific file,
though, just to make sure?

08:49.947 --> 08:52.700
Oh... Who do you wanna see? Genghis Khan?

08:52.742 --> 08:53.618
Marie Antoinette?

08:53.659 --> 08:55.828
Walt Disney's got some freaky stuff
in his file.

08:56.996 --> 08:58.331
Doug Forcett.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.375
I don't get this, man.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.586
Why wouldn't you want to know
what our life was like?

09:03.794 --> 09:06.839
You're not even a little bit curious
what it was like to hit this?

09:07.089 --> 09:08.674
I don't mean <i>this</i> this.

09:08.758 --> 09:11.677
Although, frankly,
I would also hit <i>this</i> this.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.847
I don't want to see those memories
because, philosophically speaking

09:14.889 --> 09:16.641
they're none of my business.

09:16.682 --> 09:20.269
They happened to someone else.
Let me explain.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.313
Take a seat.

09:22.355 --> 09:24.357
Conceptions of the self!

09:24.649 --> 09:28.819
Let's start with John Locke, who believed
that personal identity was based on

09:28.861 --> 09:32.865
having a continued consciousness:
essentially, memory.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.745
Memories are links in a chain that together
form a single self.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.747
If I can't remember what happened

09:39.872 --> 09:42.792
because it happened to a Chidi
from another timeline

09:42.875 --> 09:44.877
it's not a unified "me."

09:44.919 --> 09:47.838
Just because you don't remember doing
something doesn't mean you didn't do it.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.674
I have no idea how it happened

09:49.715 --> 09:53.678
but there is definitely a tattoo on my butt
that says "Jasom."

09:53.886 --> 09:56.597
- That brings us to Derek Parfit.
- It does?

09:56.722 --> 10:00.101
Parfit said, even if I have memories
from an earlier time

10:00.184 --> 10:02.895
that doesn't necessarily mean it was "me".

10:03.062 --> 10:07.441
After all, if my brain was split in two
and each half was put in a different person

10:07.692 --> 10:09.360
which one is "me"?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.697
All I know is that other Chidi
doesn't exist anymore

10:12.780 --> 10:16.784
and this one does,
so this must be the real Chidi.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.329
And all I know is that you're just barfing
Wikipedia all over everyone

10:20.371 --> 10:22.748
to avoid talking about your feelings.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.626
Let's talk about David Hume!

10:28.379 --> 10:30.548
Here we go. The Book of Dougs.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.008
Let's have a look...

10:34.677 --> 10:37.430
Doug Forbush... Forcap...

10:37.680 --> 10:38.931
Doug L. Forcett!

10:39.807 --> 10:42.268
Hey-hey, no peeking. Accountants only.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.770
Can you just tell me his total so far?

10:44.937 --> 10:48.524
Looks like he's at... 520,000 points.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.152
- Well done, Doug.
- So that's... that's good?

10:51.402 --> 10:52.445
Oh, it's excellent.

10:53.154 --> 10:54.989
Wait, he's 68 years old?

10:55.156 --> 10:56.782
Oh, that's terrible. He's screwed.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.242
I knew it!

10:58.451 --> 11:02.455
Doug has spent his entire life
being nothing but good.

11:02.538 --> 11:06.459
He once found a dollar on the ground
and he sent it to the Canadian government

11:06.584 --> 11:11.213
to help pay down their national debt,
and he isn't even close to getting in?

11:11.297 --> 11:14.341
- How can that be?
- Look, mate, the points are indisputable.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.218
They have been since the beginning.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.846
"Og gives his rock to Grog."

11:18.888 --> 11:22.183
First ever act of human altruism.
Og earned 10,000 points that day.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.144
Of course, then Grog used that
rock to beat Og's brains in

11:25.227 --> 11:26.479
and lost a million points.

11:26.562 --> 11:30.107
Point is the math is cold, objective,
and airtight

11:30.149 --> 11:33.194
and unless you can prove otherwise,
I don't know how I can help you.

11:33.527 --> 11:37.156
I just got 700 new "Weird Sex Thing" files
in the last one second.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.408
Oh, yeah, <i>Burning Man</i> just started.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.578
- Buckle up, Matty! It's gonna be a long week.
- No...

11:43.537 --> 11:47.708
So, in essence, Hume thought that
we don't truly have a "self"

11:47.792 --> 11:51.253
we're just a bundle of our ever-changing
impressions.

11:51.295 --> 11:55.049
Just admit it, man. You're embarrassed
you fell in love with an Arizona trash-bag.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.967
Eleanor, it's not personal.

11:57.134 --> 12:00.429
Someone fell in love with you,
it's just not "me".

12:00.471 --> 12:02.389
I told you not to conjure anything!

12:02.515 --> 12:05.935
Sorry, I... I... I just swapped
the living room for a classroom.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.102
Not you, him.

12:07.478 --> 12:10.189
- Jason, what is wrong with you?
- Sorry, Janet!

12:10.231 --> 12:11.899
I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.902
I was just thinking about how much fun
we used to have hanging out

12:14.944 --> 12:18.072
in his broken hot tub
and then he showed up!

12:18.197 --> 12:21.575
Yeah, I was just chillin,' being nothing,
and then all of a sudden

12:21.659 --> 12:23.118
- I "was"!
- Oh!

12:23.452 --> 12:24.495
Goodbye, Pillboi.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.454
Aw, dip!

12:25.496 --> 12:27.832
I'm "not" again!

12:28.499 --> 12:29.917
Oh...

12:30.501 --> 12:33.838
You need to hurry.
My molecular essence is fragmenting

12:34.046 --> 12:36.423
and it's giving me the worst headache.

12:36.882 --> 12:40.719
OK, here's a question.
If Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is?

12:40.803 --> 12:45.057
Let's look at one more file, someone who's
gotten into the Good Place this year.

12:45.099 --> 12:47.560
Alright. Why don't we look at...

12:48.519 --> 12:50.062
No one. No one got in.

12:50.855 --> 12:52.606
No one's gotten in for a year?

12:52.857 --> 12:55.401
- Correct.
- How about the last three years?

12:55.693 --> 12:56.944
Alright, uh...

12:57.069 --> 12:58.445
Beep, boop...

13:01.824 --> 13:03.284
Uh, no one.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.412
When was the last time someone got in?

13:06.537 --> 13:08.914
The last time someone got enough points

13:08.956 --> 13:10.916
to get into the Good Place was...

13:11.417 --> 13:13.002
521 years ago.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.256
Michael... um...

13:19.216 --> 13:20.342
Yo, homie.

13:21.468 --> 13:25.139
You and Eleanor were fighting before
and I couldn't help but overhear.

13:25.598 --> 13:26.473
Hey.

13:26.932 --> 13:31.103
If we hear with our ears,
why's it called "butt overhearing?"

13:31.478 --> 13:35.566
Bro, if you don't like her,
you should just tell her.

13:35.900 --> 13:39.320
It's not about whether I "like" Eleanor.

13:39.570 --> 13:43.991
I got into philosophy to try to make sense
of a world that almost never makes sense

13:44.033 --> 13:47.536
and that was before I learned that I died

13:47.620 --> 13:51.332
and then un-died and then re-died...

13:51.749 --> 13:55.169
I just can't take one more thing.
It's too much.

13:55.628 --> 13:57.296
I'm gonna tell you a story.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.508
Back in Jacksonville, there was this guy
in my 80-person dance crew

14:01.592 --> 14:03.010
named Stank Toby.

14:03.052 --> 14:06.597
Hang on. It was a 60-person dance crew.

14:06.722 --> 14:07.806
Um...

14:08.474 --> 14:09.391
Oh, dip!

14:10.142 --> 14:11.644
What are numbers?

14:11.852 --> 14:14.063
You're not Jason-Janet!

14:14.146 --> 14:17.566
You're Eleanor-Janet
pretending to be Jason-Janet!

14:17.650 --> 14:21.487
That is so wrong and so confusing!

14:21.695 --> 14:24.907
What was I supposed to do, man?
You wouldn't talk to me!

14:24.990 --> 14:26.200
This seemed like the only option.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.202
Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor!

14:28.327 --> 14:31.914
- I'm Arizona shrimp horny!
- That's not what I sound like, Jason.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.749
- Get out of here.
- Oh, dip.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.377
Look, you know what?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.336
Just forget it.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.381
What am I even doing? I-I'm chasing a dude
who isn't into me

14:40.422 --> 14:42.967
I'm making myself vulnerable for no reason.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.177
I don't even know who I am anymore.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.721
Uh-oh.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.933
- This is new.
- I'm so annoyed at myself!

14:51.016 --> 14:52.893
God... Stupid Eleanor!

14:53.143 --> 14:54.269
Stupid!

14:55.479 --> 14:57.690
This whole thing sucks, you know?

14:57.773 --> 14:58.941
Eleanor... you... you're not...

14:58.983 --> 15:01.902
The one thing I never wanted to do, ever,
for any reason

15:01.944 --> 15:04.488
was to follow some guy around
like a lame puppy dog.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.615
I mean, look at me, I don't need to do that!

15:06.657 --> 15:08.283
I can get any guy I want!

15:08.325 --> 15:09.952
Eleanor, just... hang on...

15:09.994 --> 15:11.370
What, dude? What?

15:11.453 --> 15:12.705
What do you want?

15:12.788 --> 15:13.747
What is going on?

15:13.789 --> 15:15.332
OK.

15:15.541 --> 15:16.458
Well...

15:16.917 --> 15:18.752
- This is bad.
- Why are you staring at me?

15:18.919 --> 15:21.046
Do I have a zit on my nose or something?

15:21.130 --> 15:24.466
Your sense of self is crumbling,
and it's taking the void down with it.

15:24.508 --> 15:25.801
Great, so...

15:25.843 --> 15:28.762
I don't feel like myself for two seconds
and it breaks the universe?

15:28.971 --> 15:32.099
How come nothing went wrong when
Chidi freaked out about his identity

15:32.141 --> 15:33.183
for three hours?

15:33.267 --> 15:35.686
Because freaking out about everything
<i>is</i> my identity.

15:35.978 --> 15:36.979
Not to brag.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.897
I need you to hold it together.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.649
Try to do something Eleanor-y.

15:40.691 --> 15:43.819
Laugh at someone who falls down,
or show up to an event underdressed

15:43.861 --> 15:46.613
and get mad at everyone else somehow.
I'll be right back.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.245
I know I asked you this before, but...

15:53.287 --> 15:56.331
No, darling, this is not where
the Mac and PC guys live.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.709
Whoa! Check out this dope flat screen.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.045
It's air-mounted!

16:01.545 --> 16:02.671
Do you see this, Tahani?

16:02.921 --> 16:05.924
This must be where Janet
stores all her information.

16:06.008 --> 16:10.721
This screen can literally show us anything
that has ever happened!

16:10.846 --> 16:12.681
Cartoons! Cartoons!

16:13.307 --> 16:14.558
I think it's broken.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.935
TV, play cartoons for Jason!

16:17.061 --> 16:20.105
Oh, my.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.940
Janet has a crush on you.

16:22.274 --> 16:25.402
I'm sorry. It's not just a crush.

16:25.944 --> 16:30.741
I think in one of the reboots,
you and Janet were... married.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.367
Whoa! Married?

16:32.534 --> 16:33.869
Oh...

16:34.328 --> 16:37.247
this flat screen
must have been a wedding present.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.375
It's all starting to make sense now.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.754
Well, I've gotta run. We're having a little
"thing" in the breakroom

16:43.796 --> 16:45.214
for Marisol's birthday.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.674
She's turning 39 million, again.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.551
So, if there's nothing else...

16:49.635 --> 16:53.180
"If there's nothing else?"
Neil, be logical.

16:53.222 --> 16:57.142
Not one Good Place resident
in over 500 years?

16:57.643 --> 17:00.354
Not Jonas Salk, not Harriet Tubman?

17:00.395 --> 17:03.190
Not one single Golden Girl?

17:03.232 --> 17:06.360
The Bad Place has hacked your system!

17:06.652 --> 17:08.821
No, it hasn't. How dare you!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.572
Frankly,
I'm beginning to resent your tone, sir.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.449
If you've got a problem,
then go to the Good Place

17:12.491 --> 17:14.535
take it up with the Committee.
Now, if you'll excuse me

17:14.576 --> 17:17.287
I have to get to the breakroom
because there's cake over there

17:17.329 --> 17:20.040
and if I don't move quickly,
Erika will get the last corner piece!

17:20.124 --> 17:20.999
Good day, sir.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.460
Oh, no, no, no. This can't be happening.

17:23.752 --> 17:28.257
No, he was supposed to tell us what to do!
If he's not gonna fix this, who is?

17:29.675 --> 17:30.592
You, Michael.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.137
It has to be you.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.223
We keep wandering around these
different realms, expecting someone else

17:36.265 --> 17:38.308
to have the answer, but no one ever does.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.060
You're the guy, Michael.

17:40.269 --> 17:43.355
You're the only one who can fix
whatever's wrong with the afterlife.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.483
But before we get into that,
Eleanor's identity is shattering

17:46.525 --> 17:48.402
inside of my void, and I might blow up

17:48.443 --> 17:51.822
so I'm gonna need you to grab a paperclip
and marbleise me, like, yesterday.

17:51.864 --> 17:53.574
- What's gonna happen to the humans?
- No idea

17:53.615 --> 17:55.826
but I can't take them out of my void
in the middle of this office

17:55.868 --> 17:58.162
and if we do nothing, everyone's gone-zo!

17:58.370 --> 18:01.456
Marbleise me, get us somewhere safe,
and bring me back.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.917
Right. Paperclip! I need a papercli...
Hey, Matt!

18:04.459 --> 18:05.711
Do you have a paperclip?

18:06.253 --> 18:07.921
What are you gonna use it for?

18:08.338 --> 18:10.382
- Chidi? I'm scared.
- I know.

18:10.424 --> 18:12.968
What am I supposed to be doing right now?
I don't remember.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.429
I'm having a hard time... remembering...

18:16.513 --> 18:17.514
Right.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.726
Memories. You need to remember who you are.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.313
You're Eleanor Shellstrop,
from Phoenix, Arizona.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.481
Your favourite meal is shrimp scampi.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.859
You listed your emergency contact
as Britney Spears

18:28.901 --> 18:30.736
as a longshot way of meeting her

18:30.777 --> 18:34.573
and your favourite movie is that clip
of John Travolta saying "Adele Dazeem".

18:34.948 --> 18:39.328
You flew halfway around the world
because you wanted to be a better person

18:39.369 --> 18:40.787
and it was very brave.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.332
You're sharp and you're strong.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.669
You make fun of me a lot,
you once called me a "human snooze button"

18:47.711 --> 18:51.256
but you also showed up in my classroom
when I was drowning in despair

18:51.298 --> 18:55.093
and canned chili,
and you basically saved my life.

18:55.219 --> 19:00.807
You have very high self-esteem and a very
low tolerance for men who wear sandals

19:00.849 --> 19:05.896
and your worst nightmare is someone
saying something nice about you

19:05.938 --> 19:08.607
to your face, but too bad,
because I need to say it

19:09.483 --> 19:10.734
because you deserve it.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.361
Because...

19:12.736 --> 19:13.654
- Because...
- Chidi!

19:33.382 --> 19:34.800
Nice work, bud.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.595
Did you mean everything you said, or...

19:39.012 --> 19:41.765
did you just say it because the world
was ending?

19:43.392 --> 19:48.522
I really wanna play this cool,
but I'm afraid that I'm gonna ruin it

19:48.605 --> 19:50.357
if I try to be sexy.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.319
I already ruined it, um...

19:54.987 --> 19:57.322
saying the word "sexy" is not sexy...

20:01.451 --> 20:02.577
- Wait!
- Oh, Jesus!

20:02.786 --> 20:03.787
I'm OK.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.123
- You're sure?
- Yes. I'm OK.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.833
Wait... uh-oh... ooh.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.377
- What?
- They're not Janets anymore, they're...

20:10.502 --> 20:12.629
them, and they're not sitting well.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.214
Incoming.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.971
They're all here, and they're safe!

20:23.307 --> 20:24.891
From the old scary thing.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.311
Now there's a new scary thing.

20:28.854 --> 20:31.189
Hi, guys! I'm Neil. Welcome to Accounting.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.609
Now, uh... it does seem that four of you
are interdimensional fugitives

20:34.693 --> 20:37.154
so I did go ahead and hit the alarm.
Sorry about that.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.780
But, uh, there is some good news.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.407
- There's some cake left.
- Yes!

20:40.699 --> 20:43.952
- Michael, what are we going to do?
- Guys, I'm so sorry.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.705
- The Accountant was no help.
- Rude.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.666
No one's gotten into the Good Place
in 500 years.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.420
We have no plan.
No one's coming to save us.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.133
So...

21:02.054 --> 21:03.305
I'm gonna do it.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.268
Follow me!

21:08.810 --> 21:11.563
The corner piece! No!

21:15.692 --> 21:18.111
You can't take the Book of Dougs.
Accountants only!

21:18.153 --> 21:22.324
I need one of you to volunteer
to do something outrageously insane

21:22.449 --> 21:25.744
that will either make you cease to exist
or be really fun.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.163
- That's most of the things I've tried!
- That's my guy! Come on, come here.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.206
Get in the tube!

21:29.289 --> 21:31.124
Oh, hell yeah! I love gettin' in stuff!

21:39.674 --> 21:41.635
No way to know what happened to him,
so come on, let's go.

21:41.676 --> 21:42.719
Everyone else, come up.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.013
There you go.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.105
Ow!

21:56.858 --> 21:57.943
That was awesome!

21:58.026 --> 21:59.569
Awesome! I want to go again!

22:02.656 --> 22:03.949
Where are we?

22:05.450 --> 22:06.743
We're in the Good Place.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.539
No offense, dude, but you have told us
a lot of lies in the last 300 years

22:10.580 --> 22:12.958
so seriously, where the fork are we?

22:14.626 --> 22:15.585
Fork.

22:16.545 --> 22:17.462
Shirt.

22:17.546 --> 22:18.547
Ash-hole.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.968
Holy forking shirtballs...

22:23.802 --> 22:25.595
we're in the Good Place!
