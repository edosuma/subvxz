<i>The Channel 3 Noon Report, with anchor</i>
partners Greg Corbin and Terry Bates.

00:36.834 --> 00:40.119
News that's independent,
proud and unashamed.

00:40.212 --> 00:42.205
- Good news today, Greg.
- Sure is.

00:42.298 --> 00:46.627
The threat level has been lowered,
prompting reductions in security.

00:46.718 --> 00:48.795
The threat level is now blue,

00:48.888 --> 00:51.675
- same as my handsome coanchor's eyes.
- Stop.

00:51.765 --> 00:55.348
- Come on, now. Learn to take a compliment.
- Thank you.

00:55.436 --> 00:58.436
Now, how hard is that?
Let's check the freeways.

01:00.023 --> 01:02.431
Hey, they just lowered the terror level.

01:02.526 --> 01:06.191
- Sweet. Wanna play backgammon?
- Do I.

01:09.241 --> 01:12.409
Well done.
Our country is a full colour-value safer.

01:12.495 --> 01:15.412
Hey. The boss just said
we could take a half-day.

01:15.498 --> 01:18.332
All right. I got stuff to do.

01:27.009 --> 01:30.010
- Wanna ride the escalators at the mall?
- Do I.

01:32.724 --> 01:37.599
- Take something out or close the refrigerator.
- Nothing looks good to me.

01:37.687 --> 01:40.853
You know what looks good?
Francine bent over that sink.

01:40.940 --> 01:43.858
Klaus, calm down. Well, you're home early.

01:43.943 --> 01:46.944
That's my reward
for making the world a safer place.

01:47.029 --> 01:49.235
That and this magnificent paycheck.

01:49.323 --> 01:52.657
- That's my Stan the Man.
- Here's your allowance, champ.

01:52.743 --> 01:55.364
- Wow. A whole five bucks.
- Yeah, I need change.

01:55.454 --> 01:59.452
- I can't buy a GameStation with this.
- You know, when I was a boy, $5...

01:59.542 --> 02:02.543
I'll give you $10 not to tell me this story.

02:03.129 --> 02:07.707
- What's this? Smells like crap.
- It should be empty. I had my soup for lunch.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.003
Honey, why is there a biohazard symbol
on your Thermos?

02:11.095 --> 02:13.337
Lemme see that.

02:22.357 --> 02:24.017
This is not soup.

02:24.108 --> 02:29.269
Langley Falls, where the Smith family is
quarantined in their Georgian colonial home.

02:29.364 --> 02:32.779
Actually, it's a Cape Cod.
The shutters are a dead giveaway.

02:32.868 --> 02:35.358
Thanks for correcting me, that's how I learn.

02:35.453 --> 02:40.246
They've been exposed to a biological agent
which will liquefy their internal organs.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.741
We have an image
of what that might look like,

02:42.835 --> 02:45.707
- but it's not for the squeamish.
- I'm not gonna look.

02:45.797 --> 02:47.624
This is a nightmare.

02:47.716 --> 02:50.918
<i>Don't worry,</i>
the media sensationalises everything.

02:51.010 --> 02:54.380
- Friend, what's the real deal?
- You're not going to die...

02:54.472 --> 02:57.045
- See there?
- What a relief.

02:57.141 --> 02:59.099
...for 24 hours.

02:59.186 --> 03:04.014
Just enough time for you to learn not
to interrupt someone when they're talking.

03:04.107 --> 03:06.894
We'll find a place for that homeless shelter.

03:06.985 --> 03:11.481
Thanks for all your hard work, Hayley.
And thanks for walking me home.

03:11.573 --> 03:14.324
My God.

03:15.368 --> 03:17.694
They let me come say goodbye.

03:17.788 --> 03:21.286
- I'm gonna miss you guys.
- How come she gets to live?

03:21.374 --> 03:24.292
I was helping the homeless
while you were being a loser.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.378
Yeah? Who's the loser now, loser?

03:27.464 --> 03:30.880
- Mom, Steve just infected me.
- Nobody likes a snitch.

03:31.343 --> 03:33.916
I don't believe this. We're all gonna die.

03:34.012 --> 03:36.634
Yeah, tough break.
Can you hold this for me?

03:36.723 --> 03:39.095
- What are you doing?
- Measuring for drapes.

03:39.184 --> 03:41.758
Soon as you're dead,
I'm gonna redo this place.

03:41.854 --> 03:46.100
I'm thinking something vibrant,
like a sea foam green.

03:46.191 --> 03:50.271
Cos I'm gonna need a lot of happy
to get over all this sad.

03:50.362 --> 03:55.024
- Dimmer switches everywhere.
- What makes you think you'll survive?

03:55.117 --> 03:58.865
- I'm immune to all human ailments.
- So explain that cold sore.

03:58.953 --> 04:02.999
- Mind your own business.
- Stop bickering. Time is precious.

04:03.083 --> 04:06.499
We have to make the most
of our last 24 hours together.

04:06.587 --> 04:09.422
She's right.
We should sit together as a family.

04:09.506 --> 04:13.006
<i>And watch</i>
the entire first season of 24 on DVD.

04:20.934 --> 04:24.304
That was bold television.
We still have a minute to spare.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.066
- I can't believe I'll die a virgin.
- Sweetie.

04:27.149 --> 04:30.103
<i>There was a 70-80% chance</i>
of that happening anyway.

04:30.193 --> 04:33.812
- Daddy.
- No tears, dammit. A Smith dies with dignity.

04:33.906 --> 04:40.158
Kids, I've been tough on you,
but only because I love you so very, very...

04:41.330 --> 04:43.406
Right. I should probably wait.

04:43.499 --> 04:45.491
This is it.

04:50.339 --> 04:51.537
Look.

04:52.299 --> 04:56.344
- I was just snoozing.
- You're alive. We all are.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.880
That clock's always fast.
Let's give it a few more minutes.

05:01.099 --> 05:03.638
Good news. That batch of virus was inert.

05:03.728 --> 05:05.850
- So that means...
- We're gonna be OK.

05:05.938 --> 05:10.647
Yes. Although apparently
your manners died years ago.

05:10.735 --> 05:12.228
You're welcome.

05:13.237 --> 05:17.021
- What's wrong, honey? We're alive.
- I know, and that's good.

05:17.116 --> 05:20.201
But, well, when I thought
we were gonna die,

05:20.286 --> 05:23.737
it made me realise
how little I've done with my life.

05:23.831 --> 05:27.200
And now I guess I'm feeling unfulfilled.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.998
<i>I've given you everything</i>
you could ever want.

05:30.087 --> 05:35.674
You clean, you cook, and once a week
we lie together as husband and wife.

05:36.677 --> 05:40.378
- What's going on?
- Hi, Barb Hanson, Exposition Realty.

05:40.473 --> 05:45.016
Your virus scare prompted these folks
to put their house on the market.

05:45.103 --> 05:47.807
- Any questions?
- No, that was very concise.

05:47.897 --> 05:51.266
Call if you ever need a real estate agent.
I'm also a hand model.

05:51.359 --> 05:54.858
Sweet Sean Hannity. Your hands are lovely.

05:54.946 --> 05:58.730
- Come on, Francine.
- Boy. She seems so confident.

05:58.825 --> 06:05.574
The way she wears that smart blazer with her
company's logo. Her life must be so exciting.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.788
- You could do what she does.
- You think?

06:07.875 --> 06:12.621
Absolutely. We will absolutely get you
a real estate costume. You'll look adorable.

06:12.714 --> 06:15.204
And I'll dress up as a sea captain.

06:15.299 --> 06:17.423
- I mean a real job.
- It'll be great.

06:17.510 --> 06:22.422
I'll be Admiral Finch and you'll be
Lady Constantina, my real estate agent.

06:22.516 --> 06:26.429
We'll promenade around,
delighting young and old with our banter.

06:26.519 --> 06:31.893
I can't be a real estate agentjust because
you say so. It takes years to get a licence.

06:31.983 --> 06:34.901
You leave that to me, milady.

06:42.494 --> 06:43.869
- Barb Hanson?
- Yes.

06:43.953 --> 06:45.282
Go.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.661
Wait. Go.

06:51.210 --> 06:56.205
- What's going on?
- Congratulations, you're in real estate.

06:56.299 --> 07:00.796
- This is Barb's stuff. What happened to her?
- She'll be fine.

07:04.015 --> 07:06.589
Hi, Barb Hanson, Exposition Realty.

07:06.685 --> 07:09.258
Mind if I borrow one of your napkins?
Thanks.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.903
- You let your wife get ajob?
- No, it's more like a hobby.

07:19.990 --> 07:23.156
Something to keep her busy
until Stan the Man gets home.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.568
- I worked in real estate.
- What are you, gay?

07:25.662 --> 07:30.787
I was. Once I stopped selling houses,
my sodomy cleared up like that.

07:30.876 --> 07:34.790
You know what's wrong about gayness?
With two men, who has the vagina?

07:34.879 --> 07:39.921
- No kidding. You need a vagina.
- Yeah, vaginas are great. Wish I had one.

07:43.013 --> 07:45.967
I did it, I sold my first house.

07:46.058 --> 07:49.972
Who's my big girl? And such a nice family.

07:50.062 --> 07:54.854
They're just the movers.
The new owners are Greg and Terry.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.981
We don't want their kind
in this neighbourhood.

07:59.071 --> 08:03.649
- You're overreacting.
- Overreacting? Overreacting?

08:03.742 --> 08:06.529
Do you know what those two are?

08:06.620 --> 08:10.534
Reporters. That's right, Francine,
members of the liberal media.

08:10.624 --> 08:14.788
Stan, not all journalists are bad.
You like Brit Hume, don't you?

08:14.879 --> 08:17.167
You know damn well I like Brit Hume.

08:17.256 --> 08:22.463
- Just give Greg and Terry a chance.
- All right, but if I... What the hell?

08:22.553 --> 08:24.841
Dimmer switch.

08:27.016 --> 08:30.965
I'm sorry. Too fabulous? I hate this place.

08:31.061 --> 08:35.474
I haven't even told you the best part.
Look at my commission cheque.

08:35.566 --> 08:39.267
Incredible. That is more
than Stan the Man makes in a month.

08:39.361 --> 08:41.437
And that's just for one house.

08:41.530 --> 08:47.782
<i>You have been emasculated by the superior</i>
earning power of your little Hausfrau.

08:51.415 --> 08:54.784
God. Stud. Stud. Hit the stud.

08:58.631 --> 09:03.174
- Well, you're in a pickle here.
- I agree. In a relationship, money is power.

09:03.261 --> 09:06.345
This is just a bump in the road.
Francine's like a puppy.

09:06.430 --> 09:09.716
She's having fun chewing her new bone,
selling a few houses,

09:09.809 --> 09:13.936
but she'll get bored and go back to ironing
and scooting her ass on the carpet.

09:14.021 --> 09:18.233
- Open your eyes. Your manhood is at stake.
- That's crazy.

09:18.317 --> 09:21.852
Is it? When my wife started working,
I didn't think twice.

09:21.946 --> 09:26.524
But she kept earning more and more money
and then one day, bam!

09:27.994 --> 09:31.612
And I didn't even get to say goodbye.

09:38.295 --> 09:41.961
Your manhood is at stake.
Your manhood is at stake. Your...

09:42.050 --> 09:44.256
We're not gonna car pool any more.

09:46.721 --> 09:51.050
Here's to Mom. She's finally cast off
the shackles of domestic servitude

09:51.142 --> 09:54.345
and realised her potential
as an independent woman.

09:54.437 --> 09:56.975
How would you like a punch in the face?

09:57.064 --> 10:00.398
I have a little surprise.
I bought you all presents.

10:00.485 --> 10:04.483
- A donation for my shelter.
- 50 bucks towards my GameStation.

10:04.573 --> 10:07.359
A tie? When do I ever wear a tie?

10:07.450 --> 10:11.400
- Thank you very much.
- You paid? You were going to the bathroom.

10:11.496 --> 10:14.283
- I did both.
- You can just do it all, can't you?

10:16.500 --> 10:19.786
Yeah, and we still need 100 bucks
for that GameStation.

10:19.879 --> 10:24.043
Don't worry, I have a plan.
Toshi, you have a video camera, right?

10:27.804 --> 10:30.971
Wow, that's a lot of words for "Of course".

10:31.057 --> 10:34.390
I get it. We can sell Toshi's camera
and get the money.

10:34.477 --> 10:39.638
<i>Why do you always make everything so</i>
complicated? The plan is quite simple really.

10:39.732 --> 10:43.433
Toshi will borrow a camcorder
from his parents.

10:43.528 --> 10:46.612
Meanwhile, Snot and I
will find some lovely ladies

10:46.698 --> 10:50.197
willing to "go wild"
in exchange for a little financial aid.

10:50.285 --> 10:53.653
We'll have ourselves a little photo shoot.

10:53.746 --> 10:59.701
After that, we make thousands of duplicates,
market the tapes on late-night cable TV.

10:59.794 --> 11:04.955
And then we retire and live out our days
playing video games.

11:08.303 --> 11:13.012
I wasn't sure about you fellas, but sometimes
you just wanna be around other men.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.764
- It's nice to meet you too.
- Yeah. Thanks for dropping in.

11:16.853 --> 11:21.978
I envy you guys. Just a couple
of unmarried studs enjoying life to the max.

11:22.067 --> 11:26.694
- Actually, Greg was married once.
- I was confused. Is that why you're here?

11:26.780 --> 11:29.022
It's strained between me and the missus.

11:29.115 --> 11:33.327
The balance of power in our relationship
has shifted and I don't like it.

11:33.412 --> 11:35.700
A healthy relationship is a partnership.

11:35.789 --> 11:38.956
Well, it's never equal.
Someone always ends up on top.

11:39.043 --> 11:41.913
- Yeah, but sometimes it's OK to switch.
- Really?

11:42.003 --> 11:45.539
- Down the line.
- I think I hear what you guys are saying.

11:45.632 --> 11:51.885
I'm the man and I have to reclaim the power
in my marriage. Hey, thanks, fellas.

11:53.307 --> 11:57.684
- Take a picture, why don't you?
- I'm being polite. It'd be rude not to look.

11:59.188 --> 12:04.562
Forgive me, Francine.
I'm only doing this to save our marriage.

12:05.444 --> 12:09.524
What am I thinking?
This is the woman I love.

12:09.615 --> 12:11.738
That's better.

12:11.825 --> 12:16.737
Dammit, I'm such a softie. There's gotta
be a better way to put her out of business.

12:18.290 --> 12:21.494
- Excuse me. Are you Francine's boss?
- Yes.

12:21.586 --> 12:25.333
- Go, go, go. You're all under arrest.
- For what?

12:25.422 --> 12:28.210
- Cocaine doughnuts.
- Those are powdered sugar.

12:28.301 --> 12:30.376
Put it in a rap song, jailbird.

12:30.469 --> 12:33.221
- This office is closed.
- What are you saying?

12:33.306 --> 12:35.879
I'm saying you're fired.

12:35.975 --> 12:38.300
For God's sake. Somebody pay Mr Trump.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.352
Sure we can use this house for our shoot?

12:43.440 --> 12:46.857
I heard Mom say it's been on the market
so long, it's been forgotten.

12:46.944 --> 12:50.644
Eavesdropper.
You should respect her privacy.

12:50.739 --> 12:56.575
- We don't expose our breasts without beer.
- Got ya covered.

12:59.790 --> 13:02.328
What?

13:02.418 --> 13:05.918
We are going neither wild nor totally wild
at a shelter.

13:06.005 --> 13:08.293
But we are taking your beer.

13:08.382 --> 13:11.218
<i>You ruined everything.</i>
What are you doing here?

13:11.302 --> 13:15.346
I'm giving these poor, forgotten people
a new lease on life.

13:15.431 --> 13:18.183
I think Phil is dead.

13:23.356 --> 13:29.110
<i>- Now we'll never get a GameStation.</i>
- Au contraire, my dear Snot.

13:31.030 --> 13:33.106
Hey, honey, I just heard the news.

13:33.199 --> 13:37.528
Too bad about your office. Looks like
I'm making more money than you again.

13:37.620 --> 13:42.413
I'd advise you to write an offer soon.
Mortgage rates won't stay this low forever.

13:42.500 --> 13:48.171
<i>- That's real-estate chatter.</i>
- She's closing a duplex at 4% over list.

13:48.256 --> 13:51.257
Francine, what the hell is going on?
You were fired.

13:51.342 --> 13:55.043
That's passive past tense, Trump.
You don't own that.

13:55.138 --> 14:00.049
Stan, I'm on the phone. Sorry, Randy. I'm
working out of my home office these days.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.515
- Here you go, boss.
- "Boss"?

14:02.604 --> 14:06.436
I'm Ms Smith's assistant.
Can I get you something while you wait?

14:06.525 --> 14:09.311
- A bottled water.
- It's not cold. Is that all right?

14:09.402 --> 14:11.690
Forget it.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.484
- Fran Smith and Associate.
- Hold her calls.

14:14.574 --> 14:18.786
- Francine, stop this nonsense.
- Nonsense? This job is my career.

14:18.870 --> 14:22.405
My job is a career.
This is just some silly housewife's hobby.

14:22.498 --> 14:25.868
Yeah? Well this silly housewife
loves her hobby.

14:25.961 --> 14:28.997
She's good at it. In fact, she kicks ass.

14:29.088 --> 14:34.000
- So her husband will just have to deal with it.
- I could've assassinated you.

14:34.094 --> 14:35.552
- What?
- Nothing.

14:39.766 --> 14:43.716
- It was my house first.
- You can't stand in the way of progress.

14:43.812 --> 14:45.436
Hey. What's going on?

14:45.522 --> 14:48.938
Steve's making the homeless men
beat each other senseless.

14:49.026 --> 14:52.359
It's called bum fights.
I'll make a fortune on tickets.

14:52.445 --> 14:56.444
It's exploitation. You're making money
off their pain and misery.

14:56.533 --> 14:59.949
All right, I'll handle this.
Let me get this straight, son.

15:00.036 --> 15:04.663
You're pitting desperate, downtrodden men
against one another for profit?

15:04.749 --> 15:07.370
- Yes, sir.
- I'm in.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.965
- What the hell is going on here?
- Ask Dad.

15:17.054 --> 15:20.803
He stole my bum fights idea.
He won't even give me a piece of the action.

15:20.891 --> 15:23.560
I want this to be a class act.
I introduce you both.

15:23.643 --> 15:28.057
I throw raw meat on the floor. Whoever
beats the crap out of the other gets to eat.

15:28.148 --> 15:31.980
You were supposed to shut this down.
You're degrading these men.

15:32.068 --> 15:37.489
I'm giving them jobs and self-esteem.
I'm giving them costumes and a back story.

15:37.574 --> 15:41.074
This is the Garbage Collector.
He's got his own catchphrase:

15:41.161 --> 15:44.115
"I'm taking out the trash and sorting it."

15:44.206 --> 15:50.244
And this guy, he grew up in the bayou, living
with alligators, wrestling with alligators.

15:50.337 --> 15:52.911
I call him the Aviator.

15:53.007 --> 15:57.752
Fight night's already sold out.
I set up a ring, fans can make bets.

15:57.845 --> 15:59.921
I even put out some nice mixed nuts.

16:00.014 --> 16:02.551
No. Those are for people.

16:02.641 --> 16:06.141
I can't believe you muscled out
your own son. You stink, Dad.

16:06.228 --> 16:10.440
What's more important - your hopes
and dreams, or me making more than Mom?

16:10.524 --> 16:14.224
- This is pure exploitation. I'm telling Mom.
- Go ahead.

16:14.319 --> 16:18.567
Your pals will be back on the street,
where nights are cold and fights meatless.

16:18.657 --> 16:21.148
This isn't over.

16:23.746 --> 16:27.958
Yeah. It's been that kind of week, girlfriend.
But, hey, TGI hump day.

16:28.042 --> 16:32.502
- Roger, who are you talking to?
- Tammy at Mencer Escrow, my phone buddy.

16:32.588 --> 16:35.293
Did you copy those title reports?

16:35.383 --> 16:40.091
Tams, I gotta go. Yeah, the boss
is being a real Catch U Next Tuesday.

16:40.180 --> 16:45.173
Stan the Man is back. Here. Just my little way
of saying you can keep your little job.

16:45.267 --> 16:48.185
- A diamond ring?
- I also got you a mink stole.

16:48.271 --> 16:51.853
My God. But, Stan, can we afford this?

16:51.940 --> 16:54.977
- Well, you can't, but I can.
- But how did you get...

16:55.069 --> 16:58.319
Smile for LeRoy Neiman.
He's painting us right now.

16:58.405 --> 17:01.442
- That's LeRoy Neiman?
- I thought he was black too.

17:02.535 --> 17:05.785
I've got to hand it to you, Dad.
You really pulled it off.

17:05.872 --> 17:08.196
Or did you?

17:11.169 --> 17:16.673
- You unionised the homeless?
- Yup. This is the fighting bums local 302.

17:16.757 --> 17:18.834
Yeah.

17:19.886 --> 17:23.635
- Here are our demands.
- "Longer red lights at freeway off-ramps,

17:23.723 --> 17:27.673
free doggy daycare, human dignity."
I can't meet these demands.

17:27.768 --> 17:31.683
Then start refunding money,
cos there won't be any fights tonight.

17:31.773 --> 17:34.607
- No. You can't take my money.
- Don't sweat it.

17:34.692 --> 17:39.484
I found a bum willing to scab. All you
gotta do is dress up like a bum and fight him.

17:39.572 --> 17:45.776
You're a life-saver. All right, where's the bum
stupid enough to step into a ring with me?

17:46.996 --> 17:49.618
- Who the hell is that?
- He doesn't have a name.

17:49.708 --> 17:53.705
- What do you mean?
- He killed his own name.

17:56.715 --> 18:01.840
My God. You couldn't get me the Aviator
or the Tickler or Pillow-Hands McGraw?

18:01.928 --> 18:05.297
No way, not me. I ain't no scab.

18:06.516 --> 18:11.937
Dad, this is suicide. You're a weapons expert.
When did you last fight hand-to-hand?

18:12.021 --> 18:16.979
You never forget how to fight -
it's like beating up a bicycle.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.195
Don't let it eat my heart.

18:29.998 --> 18:32.074
This is a wonderful starter home.

18:32.167 --> 18:36.994
- I've been saving it for a couple just like you.
- Soon we'll be more than a couple.

18:37.088 --> 18:40.173
Congratulations. I just thought you were fat.

18:40.258 --> 18:42.416
We're adopting.

18:42.510 --> 18:46.971
Let me show you the back yard.
It's the perfect place for a baby to play.

18:47.057 --> 18:49.808
My God.

18:49.893 --> 18:54.638
Stop it. Stan, what are you doing?
Leave my husband alone.

18:54.731 --> 18:57.436
Look. That bum's wife
has to jump in and save him.

18:57.526 --> 19:00.396
What a wuss.

19:15.794 --> 19:18.415
It's a knockout. My dad wins.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.210
I lost a pile of dough
on that one-thumbed psycho.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.672
Me too. Let's exit quickly.

19:24.428 --> 19:28.177
- I did it. I'm Stan the Man.
- Not really.

19:28.265 --> 19:31.800
<i>We paid this guy to take a dive</i>
then bet everything on you.

19:31.893 --> 19:34.100
So this whole thing was a setup?

19:34.188 --> 19:38.137
More of a performance piece.
Hi. Ted Fiedler, method actor.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.641
I'm also a hand model.

19:40.736 --> 19:43.653
No!

19:43.739 --> 19:46.942
- Stan, why did you do this?
- Money.

19:47.034 --> 19:49.703
You make more of it than me.
I'm a failure as a man.

19:49.787 --> 19:54.828
- You dope. Don't you get it? We're a team.
- I know, and you're the owner. I get it.

19:54.917 --> 19:59.579
<i>No, Stan, we're equals.</i>
We share everything, good and bad.

19:59.672 --> 20:02.163
You don't have to feel threatened by my job.

20:02.257 --> 20:07.797
- So, you mean when you succeed, I succeed?
- Exactly.

20:07.888 --> 20:10.759
I was gonna hitch a ride home,
but I bit my thumb off.

20:10.850 --> 20:13.056
- So use your other one.
- Right.

20:13.144 --> 20:15.848
Thanks. Hey, teach a man to fish, huh?

20:20.693 --> 20:22.900
I made you fresh coffee.

20:22.987 --> 20:25.229
Have a good day at work, partner.

20:26.073 --> 20:30.154
Interest rates went up by 20 points,
sending mortgage rates soaring.

20:30.244 --> 20:33.245
- Smart play locking in on that low fixed rate.
- Thank you.

20:33.330 --> 20:36.083
Finally learning his own self-worth.

20:36.167 --> 20:39.037
This hike by federal reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan

20:39.128 --> 20:43.956
has jeopardised the economy and put every
real estate agent in the country out of work.

20:44.050 --> 20:46.125
That's a shame. I'm sorry, hon.

20:46.218 --> 20:49.718
Can I keep this mouse pad?
I'm keeping this mouse pad.

20:49.806 --> 20:54.800
At least I had fun. And you learned there's
no need to be threatened by my success.

20:54.894 --> 20:58.428
Absolutely. Go, Team Smith.

20:59.607 --> 21:02.276
It's Stan. Release Greenspan's schnauzer.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.277
Fanny May.

21:05.362 --> 21:09.111
- That's all for this morning. See you at noon.
- And I'll see you tonight.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.486
- Greg.
- Relax. Everybody knows.
