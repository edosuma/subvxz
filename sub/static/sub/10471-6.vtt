00:35.192 --> 00:38.237
Newborns are always beautiful.

00:38.428 --> 00:40.907
They cannot fail
to make the heart sing,

00:40.908 --> 00:44.908
for even the plainest faces
are alive with promise.

00:50.548 --> 00:54.107
But I have always seen
beauty in old age too.

00:54.108 --> 00:56.747
Light shines through the bone,

00:56.748 --> 01:00.187
exquisite even as it flickers,

01:00.188 --> 01:05.028
even as it flutters
and dims towards the end.

01:13.868 --> 01:16.267
♪ The Lord himself is thy keeper... ♪

01:16.268 --> 01:19.827
Where is Sister Monica Joan?

01:19.828 --> 01:22.308
♪ The Lord is thy defence ♪

01:28.748 --> 01:30.548
No peace for the wicked.

01:32.108 --> 01:34.427
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.747
Which one?

01:35.748 --> 01:37.947
Well, it isn't your girlfriend!

01:37.948 --> 01:41.828
Have you been up all night
tormented by visions
of her loveliness?

01:42.868 --> 01:48.387
No, I was on the beat and I came
across something... rather untoward.

01:48.388 --> 01:51.067
Is Sister Julienne there?

01:51.068 --> 01:53.107
Sister Julienne's away on retreat.

01:53.108 --> 01:55.668
Sister Bernadette's in charge
until she returns.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.148
Sister.

02:00.868 --> 02:02.228
Sister!

02:23.748 --> 02:25.107
Where did you find her?

02:25.108 --> 02:26.308
Down on the pier.

02:26.309 --> 02:29.187
The wind was wicked and she
had nothing on her feet.

02:29.188 --> 02:32.747
Oh, you poor thing. Run inside
and make up a hot-water bottle.

02:32.748 --> 02:33.987
And some tea!

02:33.988 --> 02:37.227
I have had tea and it was
most acceptable.

02:37.228 --> 02:40.427
This, conversely, fails to impress.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.467
It smells somewhat of perspiration

02:42.468 --> 02:45.508
and a great deal
of regurgitated ale.

02:47.548 --> 02:49.387
She seems quite distracted.

02:49.388 --> 02:51.267
Thank you so much for finding her.

02:51.268 --> 02:53.267
It's fine. I'm just worried...

02:53.268 --> 02:55.508
Sister!

02:58.428 --> 03:03.188
Jesus... washed the feet
of the disciples.

03:04.548 --> 03:07.947
Yeah, I bet they weren't tramping
all over Poplar,

03:07.948 --> 03:10.868
walking in dog muck
and motor oil and worse.

03:17.228 --> 03:19.707
I don't like the sound of that.

03:19.708 --> 03:21.948
I'll ring for Dr Turner.

03:25.948 --> 03:28.307
How did she get out
dressed like that?

03:28.308 --> 03:33.587
We love Sister Monica Joan, Doctor,
and do the best we can for her,

03:33.588 --> 03:36.868
but it wouldn't be right
to lock her in her room.

03:38.308 --> 03:41.667
Besides, the truth is, we don't know

03:41.668 --> 03:45.787
whether she has dementia or whether
she's just wilfully eccentric.

03:45.788 --> 03:50.347
I understand. There are more medical
treatises written about senile decay

03:50.348 --> 03:52.667
than you can shake a stick at.

03:52.668 --> 03:55.707
But I keep to one invariable
diagnostic rule,

03:55.708 --> 03:58.587
if they're brought back
by a policeman in their nightie

03:58.588 --> 04:00.787
then they've got it.

04:00.788 --> 04:03.387
For now, the pneumonia
is the real concern.

04:03.388 --> 04:04.907
The old people's friend.

04:04.908 --> 04:08.347
If they are ready to go,
it takes them gently.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.947
We could try penicillin,

04:09.948 --> 04:13.147
but if she has any family,
I think they should be sent for.

04:13.148 --> 04:16.307
She's been estranged from her family
since she took her vows.

04:16.308 --> 04:21.587
The head of our order, Mother Jesu
Emmanuel, is really her next of kin.

04:21.588 --> 04:23.388
I will call her at once.

04:30.988 --> 04:34.747
I will not have rotting matter
put into my veins.

04:34.748 --> 04:38.707
If you don't take this penicillin,
you will be rotting matter!

04:38.708 --> 04:42.468
I note I am getting
the silver tongue treatment.

04:44.908 --> 04:48.187
Are you trying to summon up a fart?

04:48.188 --> 04:52.708
No, Sister,
I am praying for strength.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.787
Everybody's asking how she is.

04:58.788 --> 05:02.387
And a lady called just now
and left these roses.

05:02.388 --> 05:06.387
Mm, roses. There'll be roses
on her coffin if she won't take
the proper treatment.

05:06.388 --> 05:10.467
Mother Jesu, if she finds out,
she'll be outraged.

05:10.468 --> 05:15.507
Mother Jesu is coming in love
and very possibly to say goodbye.

05:15.508 --> 05:20.388
We are not going to lose
Sister Monica Joan.

05:23.228 --> 05:26.948
She is going to take that penicillin
even if it kills us.

05:43.828 --> 05:48.947
I suppose you think I'm suffering
a dark night of the soul,
Mother Jesu?

05:48.948 --> 05:51.867
A spiritual crisis?

05:51.868 --> 05:57.467
No, my dear, I think you are ill
and in need of powerful drugs.

05:57.468 --> 06:01.107
Your spirit seems rather
robust to me.

06:01.108 --> 06:03.348
I miss my mother.

06:04.588 --> 06:08.148
I never thought I would
when old age came to claim me...

06:10.308 --> 06:13.228
for she tried me
very sorely in my youth.

06:14.348 --> 06:17.348
I think it's cruel
that I should miss her now.

06:20.788 --> 06:23.708
All this can be remedied.

06:30.308 --> 06:34.668
You are in for a treat, Sister.
Penicillin's a wonder drug.

06:36.068 --> 06:39.707
Penicillin won't change the world.

06:39.708 --> 06:43.667
Nostradamus says nothing about it.

06:43.668 --> 06:47.547
And Nostradamus was an apothecary.

07:24.788 --> 07:29.988
Nurse Browne, there is a letter for
you. And one for Nurse Lee.

07:34.828 --> 07:38.747
Sister Monica Joan,
you're back with us.

07:38.748 --> 07:43.907
The quadrants are in alignment,
the Moon is in Venus.

07:43.908 --> 07:47.867
We are all of us
exactly where we should be.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.948
It's from my mother.

07:53.148 --> 07:55.628
She's on her way to London
from Madeira.

07:57.188 --> 07:59.707
Better not tell Sister Monica Joan.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.508
She might think
there's cake involved.

08:03.908 --> 08:06.867
Mater comes over twice a year
to get her dresses fitted.

08:06.868 --> 08:11.827
And she wants to come to see me -
here at Nonnatus House.

08:11.828 --> 08:13.827
How nice. Ask her for tea.

08:13.828 --> 08:16.628
We'll roll out
the red carpet for her.

08:19.748 --> 08:22.427
Why doesn't your mother
meet you in the West End?

08:22.428 --> 08:26.027
You could go to Fortnum's and have
some of their blissful scones.

08:26.028 --> 08:29.148
Sounds like she wants
a tour of inspection.

08:30.748 --> 08:33.668
I think she may have caught wind
of the big romance.

08:35.308 --> 08:36.948
Possibly.

08:42.628 --> 08:46.507
Oh, all right.
I added a PS to my last letter

08:46.508 --> 08:51.347
and put, "Walking out with a chap."
Then, in brackets, "in uniform".

08:51.348 --> 08:54.027
You tease! One couldn't resist.

08:54.028 --> 08:56.708
It's the news she's wanted
all her life.

08:59.428 --> 09:01.588
Oh, I forgot, letter for you.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.268
"Dear Jenny...

09:18.628 --> 09:21.308
"Why did I choose
to telephone that day?

09:23.788 --> 09:26.868
"That one day of all the days
since we last met.

09:29.468 --> 09:32.668
"Why not telephone you,
when we made each other happy?

09:34.148 --> 09:36.668
"We were nothing but careful, Jenny.

09:38.228 --> 09:41.628
"But we broke two hearts
for the sake of saving one.

09:44.748 --> 09:49.308
"This has been such a long silence,
don't let it last for ever.

09:50.428 --> 09:53.507
"I would so like to see you.

09:53.508 --> 09:57.348
"With love, Gerald."

10:05.788 --> 10:08.107
That's better.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.308
Catherine Powell.

10:21.828 --> 10:23.868
My back's been killing me.

10:25.348 --> 10:27.347
I hate to say it,

10:27.348 --> 10:30.427
but I think flat shoes might be
a little more comfortable.

10:30.428 --> 10:32.307
No, heels are my trademark.

10:32.308 --> 10:36.347
First thing my fella noticed about me
when we first met
was my pink stilettos.

10:36.348 --> 10:39.147
Well, that and my legs, presumably.

10:39.148 --> 10:41.667
This is your first visit.

10:41.668 --> 10:44.387
And your doctor seems
to be in... Hull.

10:44.388 --> 10:46.427
Yeah, I only came to London
yesterday.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.987
My fella, he's a bit of a dozy
drawers when it comes
to writing letters

10:49.988 --> 10:53.627
so I thought I'd just come here
and give him a surprise.

10:53.628 --> 10:56.067
And did you? Well, he wasn't there.

10:56.068 --> 10:58.228
Away at sea, I reckon.

11:01.388 --> 11:02.667
No.

11:02.668 --> 11:07.107
No wedding ring yet, but I'm sure
that'll change when he comes home.

11:07.108 --> 11:09.107
And where are you staying now?

11:09.108 --> 11:11.428
At his place. I let myself in.

11:13.348 --> 11:16.707
Is this going to take long?
I don't want to be away
if he comes home.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.627
Not long.

11:18.628 --> 11:23.267
We do need to go through
all your details and get you
properly booked in.

11:23.268 --> 11:26.627
We like to do a home visit
before the baby's due.

11:26.628 --> 11:28.427
Check your living conditions.

11:28.428 --> 11:29.628
What for?

11:30.948 --> 11:32.107
Home delivery.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.347
I'd also like to examine you
as well

11:35.348 --> 11:37.708
and I'd also make sure
you've got your dates right.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.348
I'm seven months,
two weeks on the dot.

11:42.068 --> 11:45.467
Looking at you, I think
you may be a little further on.

11:45.468 --> 11:48.627
No, I met Billy on my birthday,
my birthday was seven months,

11:48.628 --> 11:52.347
two weeks ago. I'm sorry
but I don't really have much time.
COMMOTION OUTSIDE CURTAIN

11:52.348 --> 11:56.547
Stand back, get some air!
Jenny, can you spare a moment?
We've got a fainter.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.668
I'll be back in one minute.

11:59.748 --> 12:01.828
That's good, just lie down.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.027
All right. Just keep breathing.

12:10.028 --> 12:14.427
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

12:14.428 --> 12:15.627
Childbearing,

12:15.628 --> 12:18.707
you have to have
the stamina of an athlete.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.668
Here, Nurse,
can you make her better?

12:22.468 --> 12:24.948
I'll get some water.

12:41.348 --> 12:42.628
Sister...

12:43.788 --> 12:46.147
Oh, I heard you was poorly.

12:46.148 --> 12:48.908
Oh, I'm that glad to see you
out and about again.

12:49.988 --> 12:52.267
Can I tempt you to a bit
of fruit today?

12:52.268 --> 12:54.347
On the house, you take your pick.

12:54.348 --> 12:55.628
How very kind.

12:56.548 --> 12:57.668
Oh...

12:58.668 --> 13:03.788
I will not suffer my pale forehead
to be kissed by nightshade.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.427
Or the ruby grape of Proserpine.

13:07.428 --> 13:10.347
I'll have a pound of those pears.

13:10.348 --> 13:11.988
My pleasure.

13:18.908 --> 13:21.547
All Saints' Crypt, May Blitz, 1941.

13:21.548 --> 13:24.867
A girl, born as they sounded
the all-clear.

13:24.868 --> 13:26.427
You remember!

13:26.428 --> 13:28.068
Yes.

13:29.708 --> 13:33.828
If you could deliver those to
Nonnatus House, I'd be much obliged.

13:37.668 --> 13:40.067
Madam's usual.
A quart of whelks.

13:40.068 --> 13:42.907
Terrific. I can smell
the vinegar from here.

13:42.908 --> 13:46.067
Can't tempt you to a bit
of jellied eel? No, ta.

13:46.068 --> 13:48.107
It's far too much like salmon
in aspic.

13:48.108 --> 13:51.588
I had quite enough of that
in my debutante days.

14:00.508 --> 14:02.588
We'll have to bring your mum here.

14:03.668 --> 14:06.107
Over my supine corpse!

14:06.108 --> 14:09.547
Tea in the best cups, with the nuns,
and that's the lot.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.747
I'm looking forward to it.

14:11.748 --> 14:13.947
I'm not.

14:13.948 --> 14:16.707
You met my parents,
we came through that.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.508
Is the dog's paw better?

14:19.908 --> 14:22.628
He gets under people's feet.
It wasn't your fault.

14:24.508 --> 14:27.947
Mater's coming on Wednesday.
You'll have to ask for time off,

14:27.948 --> 14:30.427
and you're working towards
your promotion.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.747
I want to meet your mother, Camilla.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.587
I love you,
and I want her to know it.

14:35.588 --> 14:37.187
You've never said that before.

14:37.188 --> 14:39.748
It doesn't mean
I haven't been thinking it.

14:45.108 --> 14:46.747
We're in uniform.

14:46.748 --> 14:48.387
Well, who's looking?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.908
The man on the whelk stall.

15:27.908 --> 15:31.667
You want to put a glace cherry
on those or they won't look
finished off.

15:31.668 --> 15:34.627
No, no, glace cherries are vulgar.
Fred, please.

15:34.628 --> 15:36.387
What on earth are you doing?

15:36.388 --> 15:39.667
You can't put cream in the meringues
and leave them standing.

15:39.668 --> 15:41.388
Mrs B left me the component parts.

15:43.268 --> 15:46.067
I offered to help with the assembly
but I was spurned.

15:46.068 --> 15:49.347
I'll finish them. Take the sandwiches
in and go and sit with Peter.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.467
Is he here already?
Yes, I let him in.
How does he look?

15:52.468 --> 15:54.027
Calmer than you.

15:54.028 --> 15:56.108
I'm completely calm.

16:23.548 --> 16:24.988
Hello, Mater.

16:27.188 --> 16:28.508
Camilla, dear.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.947
I believe you've recently
retired to Madeira,

16:41.948 --> 16:44.307
Lady Fortescue-Cholmondely-Browne.

16:44.308 --> 16:46.667
No need to stand on ceremony, Sister.

16:46.668 --> 16:48.988
Lady Browne will do.

16:51.308 --> 16:55.747
You must enjoy the sunshine,
after living in India.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.987
I give the weather six out of ten.

16:57.988 --> 17:00.947
Of course, the administration
is Portuguese

17:00.948 --> 17:04.788
which Sir Rex and I find
rather trying.

17:05.988 --> 17:08.547
Sandwich, Mother? They're salmon.

17:08.548 --> 17:10.186
Smoked?

17:10.188 --> 17:12.387
Tinned. No.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.507
I was under the impression
that you were in the forces.

17:18.508 --> 17:23.627
Camilla now tells me that you are,
in fact, a police constable.

17:24.667 --> 17:25.787
Yes.

17:25.788 --> 17:28.828
He's sitting
his sergeant exams next year.

17:34.548 --> 17:36.747
Constable Noakes was recently
telling me

17:36.748 --> 17:41.107
that he has to study
every single aspect of the law,

17:41.108 --> 17:44.867
from traffic offences
to crimes against the person.

17:44.868 --> 17:48.187
I've been studying
the Betting and Gambling Act,

17:48.188 --> 17:49.987
the Licensing Act,

17:49.988 --> 17:51.908
and the Prostitution Act.

17:53.348 --> 17:56.948
One hopes the theory is more savoury
than the practice.

18:00.108 --> 18:02.627
Whatever is this made of?

18:02.628 --> 18:03.908
It's Crimplene.

18:06.228 --> 18:08.067
This isn't good enough.

18:08.068 --> 18:09.747
I only wear it for church.

18:09.748 --> 18:13.148
I don't mean the skirt suit,
and you know it.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.068
What pleasure does this give you?

18:18.708 --> 18:20.467
You sent me to Roedean.

18:20.468 --> 18:22.787
Our motto was "Honour the Worthy".

18:22.788 --> 18:25.387
When I deliver babies,
that's what I do.

18:25.388 --> 18:29.307
Whom exactly do you define
as worthy, Camilla?

18:29.308 --> 18:30.707
Those people out there?

18:30.708 --> 18:33.587
That policeman downstairs?

18:33.588 --> 18:38.347
There's an entire dismantled empire
needing its worthy honoured.

18:38.348 --> 18:40.507
Africa, Malaya,

18:40.508 --> 18:42.027
India's a nightmare.

18:42.028 --> 18:45.267
I'd sooner you were a missionary
than lived like this

18:45.268 --> 18:48.467
and walked out with a man like that.

18:48.468 --> 18:52.507
Because at least our friends would
comprehend it when we told them.

18:52.508 --> 18:54.388
You'd be a spinster but...

18:55.628 --> 18:57.468
you'd be doing good works.

18:59.868 --> 19:03.308
And wouldn't be wearing Crimplene.

19:06.108 --> 19:09.507
I've been talking to my mother.
It wasn't all bad.

19:09.508 --> 19:11.267
Peter, it was diabolical.

19:11.268 --> 19:14.667
I was courting a girl once, Enid,
fancied her chances as a mannequin.

19:14.668 --> 19:16.227
One day, when we were on the bus,

19:16.228 --> 19:19.307
she said to me, "Do you like
what I've done with my eyebrows?"

19:19.308 --> 19:21.467
Peter...
That was it.

19:21.468 --> 19:22.867
I packed her in.

19:22.868 --> 19:26.667
The day I fell for you,
I saw you cycling up Leyland Street

19:26.668 --> 19:28.947
at six o'clock in the morning.

19:28.948 --> 19:31.667
You looked all in, dead beat.

19:31.668 --> 19:32.987
Don't tease.

19:32.988 --> 19:36.347
I'm not teasing. You don't half make
it hard for a chap

19:36.348 --> 19:38.907
to show his feelings.
Maybe I don't want you to.

19:38.908 --> 19:41.667
I've been turning it over and over
in my mind for weeks.

19:41.668 --> 19:45.267
Should I say, should I ask, should
I go down on my knees and beg you?

19:45.268 --> 19:47.508
What do you mean, on your knees?

19:48.588 --> 19:49.787
On one knee.

19:49.788 --> 19:52.027
I don't want you to say it at all.

19:52.028 --> 19:53.947
Why?

19:53.948 --> 19:56.507
Because you're making me
feel uncomfortable.

19:56.508 --> 19:59.987
Why? Because I've hardly ever
felt comfortable anywhere.

19:59.988 --> 20:02.788
And when I have, it's been with you.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.988
It has been the most
extraordinary thing.

20:08.668 --> 20:10.148
I felt small.

20:11.588 --> 20:16.108
And in my proper place and not at
risk of breaking anything precious.

20:21.628 --> 20:24.188
But now, all of a sudden,
I don't feel that any more.

20:28.268 --> 20:31.828
I think it's best for both of us
if we put a stop to this.

20:34.028 --> 20:35.748
Goodbye, Peter.

20:39.748 --> 20:42.108
It was all rather splendid.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.947
She's packed him in.
I knew something was up.

20:53.948 --> 20:57.747
But why? It's her wretched
mother's influence.

20:57.748 --> 21:00.507
That tea party was a horrible
thing to witness.

21:00.508 --> 21:02.867
Chummy just crumbled
in front of her.

21:02.868 --> 21:06.307
You know, Cynthia, some people do
care what their parents think.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.867
Darling, she's a grown woman,
not a schoolgirl.

21:08.868 --> 21:12.667
I don't mind her caring.
I mind her being cowed

21:12.668 --> 21:15.268
and running away from a thing
that makes her happy.

22:01.508 --> 22:04.108
Hello. Silsden 359...

22:05.428 --> 22:06.987
Hello?

22:06.988 --> 22:09.348
I'm sorry, I have the wrong number.

22:27.308 --> 22:31.187
Oi! You in the penguin dress!

22:31.188 --> 22:35.187
A simple "excuse me" would suffice.

22:35.188 --> 22:39.267
And you can give me back that spoon
you've got stashed inside
your pinafore.

22:39.268 --> 22:41.707
Pinafore? I am clad
in no such garment.

22:41.708 --> 22:45.827
Must be the first time you've been
down here without half-inching
something.

22:45.828 --> 22:48.707
You really are extremely
boorish individuals.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.708
And you are a thieving
old God-botherer!

22:57.188 --> 23:00.508
What remarkable sleight of hand.

23:04.468 --> 23:05.628
Thank you.

23:09.028 --> 23:10.628
I've had enough of this.

23:12.348 --> 23:17.107
This wasn't an isolated incident.
The costermonger, Mr Sidney Crumb,

23:17.108 --> 23:19.507
known as Cakey to his intimates,

23:19.508 --> 23:23.107
joined forces with several other
tradesmen with the same complaint.

23:23.108 --> 23:27.067
They came to my desk
in the form of a deputation.

23:27.068 --> 23:30.147
They all believe
that Sister Monica Rose is...

23:30.148 --> 23:32.147
Joan, sir.

23:32.148 --> 23:33.948
Sister Monica Joan.

23:36.308 --> 23:41.307
Is known to them as,
and I quote, "light-fingered",

23:41.308 --> 23:45.548
and has a habit of stealing small
items from their stalls.

23:47.348 --> 23:50.987
That is a serious accusation,
Sergeant.

23:50.988 --> 23:54.588
It will have to be proved
or disproved.

23:55.908 --> 23:57.788
I will escort you upstairs.

24:00.068 --> 24:02.987
Nurse Lee, will you remain here
with Sister Monica Joan?

24:02.988 --> 24:04.467
Of course.

24:04.468 --> 24:09.467
You may search her room
for stolen goods.

24:09.468 --> 24:13.187
That is, of course,
if Sister Monica Joan is agreeable.

24:13.188 --> 24:17.547
Have you anything to say
to the sergeant, Sister?

24:17.548 --> 24:19.628
Yes.

24:21.748 --> 24:23.828
Pooh to you.

24:27.188 --> 24:30.387
Five pairs of fully fashioned
nylon stockings,

24:30.388 --> 24:34.947
three egg cups, one corkscrew,
a whistle, 11 teaspoons,

24:34.948 --> 24:40.107
a hairpiece - which was blonde - a
china robin, a box of gents'
handkerchiefs,

24:40.108 --> 24:42.627
several coloured ribbons,

24:42.628 --> 24:45.507
an eau-de-nil suspender belt,

24:45.508 --> 24:50.588
a pipe rack and a box
of Steradent tablets...

24:51.748 --> 24:55.427
As you are probably aware,
Sister Monica Jones doesn't wear
dentures.

24:55.428 --> 24:59.827
I am afraid that she has been
stealing for quite some time.

24:59.828 --> 25:03.027
It's her age,
she doesn't know what she's doing.

25:03.028 --> 25:05.387
She's wily as a fox
and always has been.

25:05.388 --> 25:08.587
It's the police that's deluded
if they think she's done it
deliberate.

25:08.588 --> 25:11.067
She's away with the fairies
half the time.

25:11.068 --> 25:13.427
And half the time
she is as sane as you or I.

25:13.428 --> 25:17.507
Dr Turner will vouch
for her mental health...

25:17.508 --> 25:22.707
or lack of it - when she appears in
court. If he can't win them over,

25:22.708 --> 25:25.668
the law must take its course.

25:33.348 --> 25:37.787
'The case was referred
to the London Quarter Sessions.

25:37.788 --> 25:41.627
'We hoped against hope
that the thefts were so small

25:41.628 --> 25:44.148
'the case would be thrown
out of court.'

25:47.588 --> 25:51.147
'The suspect wandered at will.

25:51.148 --> 25:55.107
'The focus of her mind
seemed to ripple and shift...

25:55.108 --> 25:58.347
'to change as unpredictably
as weather.'

25:58.348 --> 26:03.707
♪ Glory be to the Father
and to the Son... ♪

26:03.708 --> 26:07.907
'But we were all at odds -
out of sorts and suffering.

26:07.908 --> 26:12.828
'And nothing was as it ought
to be at Nonnatus House.'

26:20.708 --> 26:23.267
Ooh! Oh!

26:23.268 --> 26:25.747
Uhh!

26:25.748 --> 26:28.587
Take your clogs off,
you little hooligan.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.787
Thank you.

26:30.788 --> 26:33.387
Much more of that
and I'll be telling you to wait

26:33.388 --> 26:35.508
till your father gets home!

26:49.348 --> 26:51.987
Nonnatus House, Nurse Lee speaking.

26:51.988 --> 26:54.308
Jenny?

26:55.508 --> 26:56.907
Jenny?

26:56.908 --> 26:58.948
This is Nurse Lee, yes.

26:59.988 --> 27:01.548
You telephoned me.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.588
My darling, darling girl.

27:10.228 --> 27:11.548
I shouldn't have.

27:14.668 --> 27:16.307
You're still married.

27:16.308 --> 27:18.828
I'm always going
to be still married.

27:22.348 --> 27:24.508
I know.

27:27.588 --> 27:30.028
If you want to see me,
will you write?

27:32.548 --> 27:33.908
Yes.

27:37.628 --> 27:39.108
Nurse Lee.

27:41.428 --> 27:43.548
All right?

27:44.588 --> 27:47.148
Will you join us for handicrafts?

27:56.188 --> 27:58.788
Enter and state your purpose.

28:03.708 --> 28:06.427
Sister Julienne asked
you to recreation.

28:06.428 --> 28:09.267
She thought you might like
to bring down your gollies.

28:09.268 --> 28:12.187
I have suspended all involvement
with my gollies.

28:12.188 --> 28:14.627
I have esoteric matters
to investigate.

28:14.628 --> 28:19.388
These bands are the parallels
wherein men and angels...

28:24.228 --> 28:25.867
and beasts,

28:25.868 --> 28:28.428
and others...

28:31.148 --> 28:32.947
You do well not to mock me,

28:32.948 --> 28:36.187
for I know it makes no sense.

28:36.188 --> 28:37.628
Sister.

28:39.068 --> 28:44.107
I'm going to get you a handkerchief
and you're going to dry your eyes.

28:44.108 --> 28:48.187
My handkerchiefs
were all given to the police!

28:48.188 --> 28:54.587
Sister Julienne took them away.
She took everything!

28:54.588 --> 28:58.108
Including my ribbons.

29:00.988 --> 29:03.107
And my china robin!

29:03.108 --> 29:05.988
And I needed... all of them!

29:07.948 --> 29:10.827
Sister Monica Joan...

29:10.828 --> 29:15.507
Close that drawer! You have no
business clawing through my things!

29:15.508 --> 29:17.387
These are not your things.

29:17.388 --> 29:20.667
Have you no secrets?

29:20.668 --> 29:24.227
Have you nothing precious
you might like to conceal?

29:24.228 --> 29:27.387
I'm not under investigation
by the police.

29:27.388 --> 29:30.187
You could end up in prison.

29:30.188 --> 29:32.787
These are valuable jewels,

29:32.788 --> 29:35.347
and Sister Julienne
was pinning all hope

29:35.348 --> 29:39.147
on the fact that the things you
stole were just cheap rubbish.

29:39.148 --> 29:41.308
Why do I do it?

29:45.108 --> 29:47.028
Is the devil tempting me?

29:48.228 --> 29:49.948
Or am I ill?

29:52.828 --> 29:54.627
I don't know.

29:54.628 --> 29:58.948
I used to know so much,
and now I don't even know myself.

30:02.148 --> 30:05.028
Or what I will do next.

30:49.908 --> 30:55.587
She must be moving things
about, secreting them
in different places.

30:55.588 --> 31:02.307
I just thought if I could take
the necklace and the ring
and the bangle,

31:02.308 --> 31:07.387
I could hide them from somebody
so nobody would ever find them.

31:07.388 --> 31:10.387
I still would,
if I knew where they were.

31:10.388 --> 31:12.628
You'd be making yourself
into an accessory!

31:13.788 --> 31:16.587
Why on earth does this sherry
taste of toothpaste?

31:16.588 --> 31:18.627
We're drinking out of tooth mugs.

31:18.628 --> 31:21.028
Close your eyes,
pretend it's creme de menthe.

31:22.948 --> 31:25.227
Oh, look! I'm in jail.

31:25.228 --> 31:27.867
Hello, Sister Monica Joan.

31:27.868 --> 31:29.587
It's not funny, Trixie!

31:29.588 --> 31:32.907
These weren't just knick-knacks
from the market.

31:32.908 --> 31:36.947
There was a pearl necklace,
a ring, an exquisite bracelet.

31:36.948 --> 31:42.147
Sly old vixen! She must've been
plying her trade in Hatton Gardens.

31:42.148 --> 31:45.507
She has come home in a taxi
at least once.

31:45.508 --> 31:50.387
I saw Sister Bernadette
pay out of the petty cash.

31:50.388 --> 31:53.467
Cynthia, you're sloshed.

31:53.468 --> 31:55.507
Have some bread pudding.

31:55.508 --> 31:57.828
I just care for her, that's all.

31:59.428 --> 32:03.907
Do you know something, Jenny? We
all care about Sister Monica Joan,

32:03.908 --> 32:05.987
and she's up to her armpits
in bother.

32:05.988 --> 32:08.147
She doesn't need you
making things any worse

32:08.148 --> 32:11.147
by saying that you might have seen
some loot in her room

32:11.148 --> 32:13.347
or that she might have hidden it,

32:13.348 --> 32:17.108
or that you might just have been
seeing things all along.

32:18.268 --> 32:20.307
Are you saying I should lie?

32:20.308 --> 32:24.828
I'm saying you should
keep your mouth shut.

32:33.628 --> 32:37.787
I saw Constable Noakes when I was
cycling past the banana sheds.

32:37.788 --> 32:41.107
Do you know, his face
was as long as a fiddle.

32:41.108 --> 32:43.387
All bobbies are romantics at heart.

32:43.388 --> 32:46.147
It's what lures them into the force
in the first place.

32:46.148 --> 32:50.187
Can we please not embark on another
discussion of Nurse Browne's
private life?

32:50.188 --> 32:52.868
Would you rather
we talked about something else?

32:54.548 --> 32:57.707
I'd rather everyone concentrated
on their handicrafts.

32:57.708 --> 32:59.427
It seems we're all on edge.

32:59.428 --> 33:05.068
And the reason for that,
of course, is entirely obvious.

33:11.748 --> 33:13.908
Saturn is in retrograde again.

33:18.908 --> 33:22.188
Oh, this one's gone through
at the crotch.

33:25.628 --> 33:28.388
I need some red wool to mend it.

33:31.988 --> 33:34.467
Sister Monica Joan?

33:34.468 --> 33:37.708
Would you be so kind
as to pass me your knitting bag?

33:39.708 --> 33:41.547
I'm sorry.

33:41.548 --> 33:43.588
I'm casting on.

33:46.508 --> 33:48.028
Oof!

33:57.148 --> 34:01.108
I haven't the faintest notion
where those came from.

34:41.308 --> 34:44.226
Can we move on now, please,
Constable?

34:44.228 --> 34:46.308
Yes, sir.

34:49.908 --> 34:52.786
Those jewels are worth
thousands of pounds.

34:52.788 --> 34:55.067
She cannot vouch for where
they came from,

34:55.068 --> 34:57.867
and the police are checking thefts
all over London.

34:57.868 --> 35:01.507
I was afraid they would.
That's why I didn't tell you.

35:01.508 --> 35:03.268
How long have you known?

35:05.068 --> 35:06.468
Three days.

35:07.908 --> 35:09.507
You could've faced charges!

35:09.508 --> 35:12.427
You could've faced the end
of your nursing career.

35:12.428 --> 35:14.147
I know. I did it because...

35:14.148 --> 35:16.228
Don't you dare say you love her.

35:17.588 --> 35:20.667
Deceit compounds deceit, Nurse Lee.

35:20.668 --> 35:24.387
You have just made matters
considerably worse

35:24.388 --> 35:26.508
and love is no excuse.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.788
Dragged over coals?

35:48.148 --> 35:49.908
Completely.

35:55.228 --> 35:58.107
You really do have a soft spot
for the old bat, don't you?

35:58.108 --> 36:00.987
Sister Monica Joan...

36:00.988 --> 36:03.267
I admire her...

36:03.268 --> 36:05.667
and she's lonely.

36:05.668 --> 36:07.987
It's a lonely life.

36:07.988 --> 36:12.147
Or at least, a peaceful one.
Rules and all that.

36:12.148 --> 36:15.748
So many roads
one doesn't have to go down.

36:16.748 --> 36:20.587
Chummy, you aren't thinking
of taking holy orders?

36:20.588 --> 36:23.228
It has presented itself
as a solution.

36:25.308 --> 36:29.468
It wouldn't be a solution,
it would be a hiding place.

36:33.668 --> 36:36.348
I came here to hide
from a love affair...

36:38.988 --> 36:42.228
from my feelings
for a man I couldn't have...

36:43.988 --> 36:47.307
and I haven't escaped
anything at all.

36:47.308 --> 36:49.267
Here.

36:49.268 --> 36:51.267
Magic hanky.

36:51.268 --> 36:53.187
May not work.

36:53.188 --> 36:55.108
Didn't work on me.

36:59.228 --> 37:02.388
You can have Peter, Chummy.

37:04.308 --> 37:08.628
There's nothing and nobody
standing in your way.

37:11.068 --> 37:12.948
Yes, there is.

37:20.388 --> 37:25.347
The defendant, Miss Antonia Cavill,
known as Sister Monica Joan

37:25.348 --> 37:29.947
of the order of St Raymond Nonnatus,
has been accused of theft.

37:29.948 --> 37:35.187
This bench is unanimously agreed
that, given the witness statements,

37:35.188 --> 37:39.867
there is a prima facie case
for the accused to answer.

37:39.868 --> 37:41.907
You may proceed.

37:41.908 --> 37:46.187
Dr Turner, as the defendant's
general practitioner,

37:46.188 --> 37:49.068
what is your opinion
of her state of health?

37:50.308 --> 37:52.987
Well, she is certainly
not as robust as she was.

37:52.988 --> 37:56.347
Fiddlesticks! I saw pneumonia off
flat in five days!

37:56.348 --> 37:58.787
He's not talking to you.

37:58.788 --> 38:00.667
Is this true, Doctor?

38:00.668 --> 38:03.147
She did respond extremely well
to penicillin.

38:03.148 --> 38:07.227
But, mentally, she has been frail
for many months.

38:07.228 --> 38:08.387
Balderdash!

38:08.388 --> 38:13.547
What this court needs to ascertain,
sir, is would the doctor

38:13.548 --> 38:19.427
have prescribed penicillin if I,
the patient, were mentally infirm?

38:19.428 --> 38:24.107
Indeed, would he
have prescribed penicillin

38:24.108 --> 38:27.787
had he thought recovery
would enable me to go out thieving?

38:27.788 --> 38:32.907
With respect, madam, Dr Turner is not
charged with curing you of pneumonia.

38:32.908 --> 38:36.827
You are charged with larceny,
specifically a sapphire ring,

38:36.828 --> 38:39.547
a pearl necklace
and a diamond bracelet.

38:39.548 --> 38:41.947
You said prima facie before.

38:41.948 --> 38:45.467
You must be precise, my man,
and not confuse your terms.

38:45.468 --> 38:46.828
If I may interject, Sister.

38:46.829 --> 38:48.748
Who is this person?

38:49.748 --> 38:52.347
He is your barrister, Mr Briggs.

38:52.348 --> 38:54.948
He's not very good.

38:58.388 --> 39:00.627
Doctor, in your opinion,

39:00.628 --> 39:04.547
does the defendant understand
the charges brought against her?

39:04.548 --> 39:06.348
No.

39:08.108 --> 39:09.987
I don't believe she does.

39:09.988 --> 39:13.427
I wish to make a statement.

39:13.428 --> 39:15.507
Sit down and wait your turn!

39:15.508 --> 39:18.267
Order in court. We're waiting our
turn, and we're the aggrieved!

39:18.268 --> 39:20.347
Sister...

39:20.348 --> 39:23.787
let Mr Briggs speak for you.

39:23.788 --> 39:27.228
None should presume
to speak for another.

39:28.056 --> 39:29.896
All judgement comes from God.

39:31.936 --> 39:35.255
And we will all stand naked
and alone before his throne.

39:35.256 --> 39:36.855
Sister Monica Joan,

39:36.856 --> 39:41.776
do you understand the nature
of the charges brought against you?

39:43.096 --> 39:45.615
I thank you for your enquiry, sir.

39:45.616 --> 39:49.535
Yes, I do.

39:49.536 --> 39:52.656
The court will adjourn
until the morning.

39:55.856 --> 39:58.415
These are fresh from the laundry,
Sister.

39:58.416 --> 40:02.335
Good. Can't have her in court
with custard on her scapular.

40:02.336 --> 40:05.815
The curse of a mind like mine
is that, sometimes,

40:05.816 --> 40:08.415
the fragments recompose themselves,

40:08.416 --> 40:11.295
rather like a shattered
looking glass

40:11.296 --> 40:13.015
that has been made whole.

40:13.016 --> 40:14.775
Horlicks and bed.

40:14.776 --> 40:17.935
I am fed up with all this
"round and round the gasworks".

40:17.936 --> 40:21.055
I know now from whence
the jewels came.

40:21.056 --> 40:23.975
It had nothing to do
with the gasworks.

40:23.976 --> 40:29.616
You must speak to Mother Jesu
and you must do so soon.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.975
I'll get it. I'm on first call.

40:32.976 --> 40:34.496
Do be quick!

40:37.096 --> 40:38.975
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

40:38.976 --> 40:42.295
Hello? Er, I think it's my
time. I don't know what to do.

40:42.296 --> 40:43.855
What's the name, please?

40:43.856 --> 40:45.256
Cathy, Cathy Powell.

40:46.576 --> 40:51.135
Mrs Powell? Cathy?
Is there anyone with you?

40:51.136 --> 40:52.296
Oh, ohhh!

40:53.656 --> 40:57.215
I have a Catherine Powell here but
no home address
and the GP's in Hull.

40:57.216 --> 40:58.696
Ohhh!

41:00.336 --> 41:04.775
Yes, that's me. Batten Buildings,
it's, er, second landing.

41:04.776 --> 41:07.855
There's a number five
painted on the door.

41:07.856 --> 41:12.135
Cathy, listen to me. Go back home
and I'll be with you in...

41:12.136 --> 41:13.695
less than 15 minutes.

41:13.696 --> 41:16.255
Please, can you hurry up?

41:16.256 --> 41:17.975
Oh!

41:17.976 --> 41:20.976
Better grab a delivery pack.
All yours. Thanks.

41:32.896 --> 41:34.375
Ah! Ah!

41:34.376 --> 41:36.336
Oh! Oh!

41:40.416 --> 41:42.376
Oh, no!

41:47.696 --> 41:49.415
There's no answer.

41:49.416 --> 41:52.215
I feared there wouldn't be,
now the silence has begun.

41:52.216 --> 41:55.655
So we will have to go to Chichester
and be there by dawn

41:55.656 --> 41:58.535
to speak to Mother Jesu.
She is our final hope.

41:58.536 --> 42:00.976
I'm about to start praying
for a car.

42:02.096 --> 42:03.736
I can get us a car.

42:11.776 --> 42:13.856
Whoa! Oi!

42:18.056 --> 42:22.136
Oh, no! The delivery pack!
Bally bugger it!

42:25.696 --> 42:28.576
Ohh! Ahhh!

42:29.856 --> 42:31.056
Cathy?

42:35.496 --> 42:37.176
I always keep my promises.

42:44.816 --> 42:48.095
It's got the name of a lewd book
written on its bonnet.

42:48.096 --> 42:51.575
Mother Jesu won't notice
once we're inside.

42:51.576 --> 42:53.935
I've got three-quarters
of a tank of petrol,

42:53.936 --> 42:56.935
so that should get us all the way.

42:56.936 --> 42:58.655
Jimmy, we are in your debt.

42:58.656 --> 43:01.455
I'd do anything for Jenny, Sister.

43:01.456 --> 43:03.975
Do you need a chaperone?

43:03.976 --> 43:06.576
We'll be quite safe,
won't we, Jimmy?

43:08.816 --> 43:12.456
Waste no time. The court sits
at nine in the morning.

43:18.736 --> 43:21.696
Ah, help!

43:25.056 --> 43:26.615
Oh, I think I've wet myself!

43:26.616 --> 43:28.936
Don't fret, that's just
your waters breaking. Oh!

43:34.456 --> 43:38.575
Oh... Having no luck
with the light switch.

43:38.576 --> 43:42.895
The leccy's off. I think it's off
in the whole block.

43:42.896 --> 43:47.055
There's some candles
on the chest of drawers.

43:47.056 --> 43:48.696
Excellent.

43:50.656 --> 43:53.775
Now, slip yourself
out of those wet drawers,

43:53.776 --> 43:56.735
lie down on your back, legs apart,

43:56.736 --> 43:59.416
knees propping upwards and outwards.

44:03.616 --> 44:07.415
Looks like you've been caught
slightly on the hop.

44:07.416 --> 44:09.296
Not quite ready for baby, perhaps.

44:12.176 --> 44:15.256
Sorry, it must feel rather strange.

44:16.496 --> 44:18.375
Not that strange.

44:18.376 --> 44:20.696
How'd you think I ended up
like this?

44:23.696 --> 44:27.815
Now, I'm going to examine you
and then pop down the road

44:27.816 --> 44:30.816
to use the telephone. I think we
might treat you to an ambulance.

44:32.736 --> 44:34.695
I've got to get it out!

44:34.696 --> 44:36.456
Oh!

44:38.656 --> 44:42.655
I've changed my mind.
We're staying right here.

44:42.656 --> 44:45.975
Do you have a cot or any blankets
for the baby? No!

44:45.976 --> 44:49.055
Have you any hot water? No!

44:49.056 --> 44:51.056
Any cold? No! No!

44:52.176 --> 44:53.656
Not to worry.

44:56.056 --> 44:58.655
Now, pant for the head.

44:58.656 --> 45:01.096
Pant, pant, pant.

45:02.696 --> 45:04.856
Ooh! Top notch.

45:06.976 --> 45:08.535
The head's out.

45:08.536 --> 45:11.575
After your next contraction,
the baby will be born.

45:11.576 --> 45:14.375
I'll put ten bob on it
being a whopper.

45:14.376 --> 45:15.976
All right.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.776
That's it.

45:20.976 --> 45:23.136
That's it!

45:38.336 --> 45:39.576
Oh!

45:42.456 --> 45:44.975
Good job I'm not a betting woman.

45:44.976 --> 45:47.376
He's a dainty little thing.

45:57.576 --> 46:01.935
His dad, Billy, he was... he was
built like a bloody brick shithouse.

46:01.936 --> 46:04.895
He had shoulders on him
like I've never seen.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.935
Docker?

46:06.936 --> 46:08.776
Sailor.

46:10.376 --> 46:16.136
He made me feel small in his arms,
like I was always meant to be there.

46:18.136 --> 46:20.976
He had lips like these.

46:22.656 --> 46:25.015
Oh!

46:25.016 --> 46:27.095
What are you doing?

46:27.096 --> 46:29.135
Just waiting for the afterbirth.

46:29.136 --> 46:31.496
It's a grisly business,
leave it to me.

46:32.616 --> 46:36.615
Ow... Ow! Is it supposed to hurt?!

46:36.616 --> 46:38.495
Not this much.

46:38.496 --> 46:39.775
Ah! Oh!

46:39.776 --> 46:41.336
It's another baby.

46:44.856 --> 46:50.096
Every window and door is closed.
Drawbridge completely pulled up.

46:53.016 --> 46:55.496
Bit like us, really.

46:58.096 --> 47:00.775
Well, at least, like you.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.656
Jimmy...

47:04.216 --> 47:06.216
you've driven all this way!

47:07.616 --> 47:09.935
You've been so kind.

47:09.936 --> 47:12.136
I'd never be unkind.

47:14.296 --> 47:16.336
What would be the point in that?

47:26.696 --> 47:28.855
That's it!

47:28.856 --> 47:32.015
Well done! Well done!

47:32.016 --> 47:35.655
Congratulations, it's another little
boy, just like the first.

47:35.656 --> 47:38.536
Twins. Not unheard of.

47:41.416 --> 47:44.096
Shh.

47:48.136 --> 47:50.416
Shh.

47:52.776 --> 47:55.455
There you go.

47:55.456 --> 47:58.296
Congratulations.
Hello.

48:03.176 --> 48:05.415
Is that the last candle?

48:05.416 --> 48:08.576
No need to fret. It'll be all right.

48:13.016 --> 48:15.976
Blasted, beastly thing!

48:21.216 --> 48:24.376
I'm on my way!

48:36.376 --> 48:39.695
Oh, it hurts, it really... It hurts!

48:39.696 --> 48:43.015
It's just the afterbirth giving
itself its marching orders.

48:43.016 --> 48:46.255
Now, there may be one or two,
according to

48:46.256 --> 48:48.536
whether or not
the babies are identical.

48:58.816 --> 49:00.455
Triplets.

49:00.456 --> 49:02.616
Ohhh!

49:05.336 --> 49:08.375
Now, gentle pushes,

49:08.376 --> 49:10.655
Just breathe, just breathe...

49:10.656 --> 49:12.455
I'm dying, I can't do it!

49:12.456 --> 49:14.455
No, we're not. We can do this.

49:14.456 --> 49:16.936
I can't do it!
Are you ready?

49:20.456 --> 49:23.615
Keep it coming!
One more push! One more push!

49:23.616 --> 49:25.416
That's it! That's it!

49:26.656 --> 49:28.576
All done!

49:32.496 --> 49:34.536
Well done! Well done!

49:39.896 --> 49:42.415
It's another boy!

49:42.416 --> 49:45.616
I've got nothing to wrap him in.

49:46.936 --> 49:48.856
We'll just have to make do and mend.

49:57.216 --> 50:00.336
I had the happiest night
of my life with Billy.

50:01.936 --> 50:05.255
I never had enough of anything
when I was growing up, but...

50:05.256 --> 50:10.215
with him, it was as if my life
was spilling out of the cup.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.536
I grabbed love with both hands.

50:15.096 --> 50:18.295
I had a chance. I took it.

50:18.296 --> 50:21.376
It was the best and bravest thing
I ever did.

50:23.136 --> 50:24.896
He gave me these.

50:26.016 --> 50:27.736
I'm never letting them go.

50:50.496 --> 50:53.336
I'm sorry I hurt you, Jimmy.

50:55.376 --> 50:57.656
You can survive hurt.

50:58.656 --> 51:00.256
I hope so.

51:12.216 --> 51:15.336
Well done. Thank you.
You deserve a good rest.

51:31.856 --> 51:33.815
I'm turning myself in.

51:33.816 --> 51:36.615
I'm guilty of criminal cowardice

51:36.616 --> 51:38.935
and robbing two people of something

51:38.936 --> 51:41.335
that would make them both
very happy.

51:41.336 --> 51:44.016
I've decided it's time to be brave.

51:46.776 --> 51:50.016
I see. I hope so.

51:54.536 --> 51:59.016
Because underneath this raincoat,
I am practically naked.

52:09.856 --> 52:12.176
I love you.

52:20.616 --> 52:23.616
The court will now rise.

52:27.976 --> 52:29.616
Sister, stand up.

52:31.496 --> 52:34.896
Father Joseph, hurry!
It's ten past nine already.

52:38.016 --> 52:40.695
When a sister takes her final vows,

52:40.696 --> 52:42.815
all her property is given
to the Order.

52:42.816 --> 52:46.815
In some Orders, this is irrevocable,
but not in ours.

52:46.816 --> 52:50.615
We merely hold the property in trust
throughout a sister's lifetime,

52:50.616 --> 52:53.335
or for as long as she remains
with us.

52:53.336 --> 52:57.015
Sister Monica Joan
took her final vows in 1904.

52:57.016 --> 52:59.055
There was something...

52:59.056 --> 53:03.535
unusual about the property
of the accused, was there not?

53:03.536 --> 53:05.575
Sister Monica Joan arrived
penniless.

53:05.576 --> 53:08.615
She had apparently
defied her family's wishes

53:08.616 --> 53:10.975
and was estranged from them,
but her mother,

53:10.976 --> 53:15.935
who had been mentally unstable,
left Sister Monica Joan a legacy

53:15.936 --> 53:19.095
and it passed into
the Order's hands in 1927.

53:19.096 --> 53:23.615
And would you like to tell the court
what that legacy was?

53:23.616 --> 53:28.575
One sapphire ring,
one necklace of pearls,

53:28.576 --> 53:31.015
one diamond bracelet.

53:31.016 --> 53:34.735
They were all put in our bank
and forgotten about...

53:34.736 --> 53:37.976
even, I believe,
by Sister Monica Joan.

53:39.656 --> 53:43.775
And can you describe how they
came to be in her possession?

53:43.776 --> 53:45.895
I gave them to her,

53:45.896 --> 53:50.135
not as objects of monetary value

53:50.136 --> 53:53.615
but as balm for an old wound.

53:53.616 --> 53:57.535
Sometimes, in extremis,
our past trials rise

53:57.536 --> 54:00.055
and cause us pain.

54:00.056 --> 54:04.775
I am a nurse and a midwife,
I will always seek to ease distress.

54:04.776 --> 54:06.055
Hear, hear.

54:06.056 --> 54:08.815
Why don't you just shut up
and keep knitting?

54:08.816 --> 54:11.535
Order in court.

54:11.536 --> 54:13.376
I thought she would recall my visit

54:13.377 --> 54:16.735
and that the jewels
would be meaningful to her.

54:16.736 --> 54:19.016
I am sad that they came too late
to be of solace.

54:19.017 --> 54:23.175
It seems that her fragility was such
that she did not recognise them,

54:23.176 --> 54:26.096
just as she did not recognise
her petty thefts.

54:28.336 --> 54:30.495
Thank you.

54:30.496 --> 54:32.816
Your Honour, I rest my case.

54:45.136 --> 54:49.136
Oh! Come on, come on! No dawdling!

54:51.576 --> 54:54.095
'All charges had been dropped,

54:54.096 --> 54:59.815
'all shadows lifted from the mind
of Sister Monica Joan.'

54:59.816 --> 55:03.696
All right there, Sister Monica Joan.
In the middle. That's it.

55:04.976 --> 55:08.056
Oh, look, there's a little one here.

55:10.456 --> 55:12.456
Thank you.

55:17.136 --> 55:20.655
'I could never forget
the man I loved.

55:20.656 --> 55:25.375
'But I could erase him
from my conscience.

55:25.376 --> 55:28.455
'However much it hurt,
I could say no.

55:28.456 --> 55:33.695
'I could refuse to see him.
Keep the very knowledge secret.

55:33.696 --> 55:37.015
'What I felt was not a crime,
but I had to be honest

55:37.016 --> 55:39.375
'and so I wrote to him,

55:39.376 --> 55:45.456
'and each word drew another line
between me and the past.'

55:47.296 --> 55:49.895
Nonnatus House, mid...

55:49.896 --> 55:52.255
Hello, Lady Browne.

55:52.256 --> 55:54.296
Chummy...

56:01.896 --> 56:03.215
What-ho, Mater!

56:03.216 --> 56:05.215
I've spoken to the Bishop.

56:05.216 --> 56:08.455
And St Margaret's, Westminster
is still a possibility.

56:08.456 --> 56:11.415
No, it isn't. I booked All Saints'
Church up the road.

56:11.416 --> 56:12.575
But you can't.

56:12.576 --> 56:16.295
It's nowhere near
a suitable reception venue.

56:16.296 --> 56:19.295
Mother, it's right next door
to the parish hall.

56:19.296 --> 56:21.176
We're going to have the party there.

56:21.177 --> 56:22.735
Camilla...

56:22.736 --> 56:24.935
And you needn't advise me
about the catering.

56:24.936 --> 56:28.655
I've asked the nuns to organise
the buffet. Sandwiches and trifle.

56:28.656 --> 56:30.415
In which case,

56:30.416 --> 56:33.575
will you at least let me
take you to Norman Hartnell

56:33.576 --> 56:35.255
and buy you a wedding gown?

56:35.256 --> 56:38.415
You can take me
to Norman Hartnell,

56:38.416 --> 56:42.135
and buy me a skirt suit.
Preferably Crimplene.

56:42.136 --> 56:45.336
As you wish. As long as it's white.

56:46.696 --> 56:48.135
Sorry...

56:48.136 --> 56:51.176
No longer entitled.

57:00.856 --> 57:02.296
Come on, Billy, hurry up.

57:38.456 --> 57:41.015
Hooray...

57:41.016 --> 57:44.135
'Newlyweds are always beautiful.

57:44.136 --> 57:47.735
'They cannot fail
to make the heart sing,

57:47.736 --> 57:51.895
'for even the plainest faces
are alive with promise.'

57:51.896 --> 57:53.696
Bye, Chummy!

58:01.096 --> 58:05.375
'In the East End,
I found grace and faith

58:05.376 --> 58:10.735
'and hope,
hidden in the darkest corners.

58:10.736 --> 58:14.055
'I found tenderness and squalor

58:14.056 --> 58:16.895
'and laughter amid filth.

58:16.896 --> 58:19.015
'I found a purpose and a path

58:19.016 --> 58:23.616
'and I worked with a passion
for the best reason of all.

58:24.936 --> 58:27.896
'I did it for love.'
