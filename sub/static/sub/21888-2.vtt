PEARL:
So...

02:19.306 --> 02:24.186
we were wondering if you've read
the latest New Yorker.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.729
No, I'm really behind.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.691
Like this... far behind. Why?

02:28.732 --> 02:31.235
Well, our esteemed leader
Leslie wrote a poem in it.

02:31.277 --> 02:32.778
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.656

02:37.908 --> 02:39.285

02:39.326 --> 02:40.536
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, my God.

02:40.578 --> 02:43.497
"My Ali, My Garcon."

02:43.539 --> 02:46.125
"Garcon.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.684
Just, you know,
wanted to reach out.

-Yeah, of course.
-Wow, the light.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.482
-Yeah.
-It's really beautiful.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.733
Do you want some tea?

03:52.775 --> 03:53.984
-Oh, that would be great.
-Yeah.

actually, so, yeah, yeah.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.201
Oh, my God.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.535
(chuckles):
Yeah, right?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.371
-Whee!

04:05.412 --> 04:07.706
-So fun!
-Yeah.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.417
-Oh. I need one of these. -It's
probably happy you're riding it.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.669
Wow, this is really beautiful.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.253
Yeah, it's cool, right?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.589
That was so funny
to run into you there.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.092
Yeah, it's funny when
you see people you know.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.303
Um, you know, I'm not, I'm not
really, like, a regular there,

04:21.345 --> 04:23.305
so I hope you weren't
looking for a sponsor?

04:23.347 --> 04:26.684
-Oh, no. No.
-Okay.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.560
I mean, I probably should be,
but no.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.312
-I'm not there yet, but...
-Okay.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.814
No, I just wanted to, like...

04:31.855 --> 04:33.357
-just kind of...
-Yeah.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.817
It was interesting.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.568
-It was an interesting meeting.
-It is, yeah.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.988
-I mean, I don't--
I try not to... -Thank you.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.864
-to judge anybody there.
-Right.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.116
'Cause, obviously,
it's a spiritual...

04:42.157 --> 04:44.284
-You mean the freaks?
All the freaks? -(laughs)

04:44.326 --> 04:46.662
Am I, like, wrong, or is that
the most unsexy group of people?

04:46.704 --> 04:48.831
Yeah.
They seem to be getting it.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.374
Well, it's not just sex,
it's love.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.084
-There's the "L," so...
-There's the "L."

04:52.126 --> 04:53.127
For sure.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.881
Love.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.926
Yeah, I don't...

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
I don't, I don't know.

05:02.845 --> 05:06.932
I don't think I really know
what-- how to actually do that.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.018
Hmm.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.733
Hmm.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.985
I remember you and your husband.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.319
Len.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.656

-Oh, sorry.
-No, no, it's actually good.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.417
I mean, it's weird.

05:33.459 --> 05:34.626
We kind of are still together.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.295
-Oh.
-I mean, you know,

05:36.336 --> 05:37.588
there's a lot of stuff going on.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.881
-Mm-hmm.
-With-- but...

05:38.922 --> 05:40.466
it's just about being honest,
I think.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.384
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, honesty's the best.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.136
Like, I could totally tell him
I was here.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.138
-Right. Why wouldn't you, right?
I mean... -Used to lie a lot.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.890
My family lies a lot.
We're liars.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.433
I think it's just because
everyone's, like,

05:49.475 --> 05:51.351
in everybody's stuff,
so you tell a lie,

05:51.393 --> 05:54.021
and you just kind of
can have some privacy.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.606
Totally.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.484

06:09.411 --> 06:10.954
We all-- you know,
you compartmentalize it,

08:06.278 --> 08:07.696
Mm.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.282
I have this belief that...

when you're born, you know,
you're kind of... perfect.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.830
You know, you just have
so much wonder.

08:16.872 --> 08:20.167
And then, you get older,

08:20.209 --> 08:23.670
and... you know, you get dumb.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.797
So that's why I like to
give them the power.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.216
-Clever.
-Yeah.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.967
Or let them think
they have the power.

-Kind of like bottoming.
-Yeah, but you're the bottom...

-Yeah.

22:05.366 --> 22:08.494
Do you feel like
it's-it's kind of like

22:08.536 --> 22:11.873
your body, you know, telling you
something about what it needs?

22:11.914 --> 22:16.044
I-I feel like it's-it's my body
screaming at me, you know.
