00:06.256 --> 00:09.843
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.470 --> 00:17.267
Standing before the presence
of the dragon gods...

00:18.018 --> 00:20.270
I humbly speak these words.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.939
Please accept this branch offering.

00:23.523 --> 00:27.318
Let me hear the name
of the chosen Key Girl.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.197
I humbly speak these words.

00:38.621 --> 00:39.581
Is it decided?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.002
For the upcoming Ritual...

00:44.419 --> 00:45.920
the Key Girl is...

02:34.821 --> 02:36.573
Anastomosis, eh?

02:37.407 --> 02:41.119
To think that once they know love,
they can no longer ride the OTF.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.914
Training them to stay away
from the male groups to start with

02:44.998 --> 02:47.750
wasn't an option either.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.379
If we had, we could've
been saved a lot of trouble.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.131
According to Ceremony Official Iboshi,

02:53.840 --> 02:57.886
Love is like an infectious disease
that's bound to be contracted someday.

02:58.511 --> 03:03.808
To make them believe that their only
reason is their bond with the OTF,

03:03.892 --> 03:06.144
love is rather necessary.

03:06.269 --> 03:11.316
Force the Dragon Pilots to fall in love
once, then shatter it into pieces.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.984
He said that to himself before.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.195
That's one thing we can't do.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.071
Are you a mother bear
and they your cubs?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.407
Aside from Senior Master Sergeant Hoshino,

03:19.490 --> 03:23.661
Technical Sergeant Amakasu was unaware
of her love towards Okonogi.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.788
To break up their love,

03:25.872 --> 03:29.334
they must realize those feelings
exist in the first place.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.961
What you think will happen?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.548
It'll go the wrong way.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.926
Definitely the wrong way.

03:39.052 --> 03:44.224
Oh dear. Also with the Ritual
just around the corner.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.688
Are we really doing this?

03:51.022 --> 03:53.858
Letting the C-1 force landing
on the carrier.

03:53.942 --> 03:58.863
To simulate landing on Lord Mitatsu,
this training is indispensable.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.242
Don't worry.
If anyone can do it, it's them.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.017
We did it, Futomomo.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.644
Yes, but...

04:30.228 --> 04:33.022
-somehow it doesn't feel right.
-What <i>do you mean?</i>

04:33.273 --> 04:37.527
Futomomo seems a little down... somehow.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.531
Probably because Masotan
and Norma aren't here.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.910
It's much more fun flying with everyone.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.080
You're lonely, aren't you, Futomomo?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.306
Ah, I'm so damn tired.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.392
-The ones weak to love?
-Women are such trouble.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.644
You're just jealous, aren't you?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.314
Oddly enough, even men like gossip.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.691
-I'm pathetic.
-El?

05:17.734 --> 05:21.696
Why do I feel like this?
I want to dig it up and pull it out.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.198
That sounds like from
a gory, splatter film...

05:24.949 --> 05:26.242
A bystander, huh?

05:26.451 --> 05:29.203
You're in the middle
of this scandal too, right?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.457
Yeah, for the most part, but...

05:44.802 --> 05:46.304
The hell was that?

05:46.387 --> 05:48.723
Why doesn't High Steward Okonogi
reject her?

05:48.806 --> 05:51.351
It's supposed to be
a sacred place of business!

05:52.185 --> 05:54.270
Doesn't it piss you off, Amakasu?

05:55.271 --> 05:57.023
W-Why would it?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.068
You do act like a bystander.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.949
-Nao.
-Huh?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.744
Can I ask you for another favor?

06:12.747 --> 06:13.748
Masotan.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.708
Masotan!

06:19.212 --> 06:20.797
Masotan!

06:32.350 --> 06:33.351
Oh yeah.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.769
That's right.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.312
I'm sorry.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.232
It's the anastomosis.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.777
To put it another way,
it's like the OTF is jealous.

06:42.985 --> 06:46.823
Like he can't accept someone else taking
his pilot's attention away from him.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.828
That time, I could sense
that Masotan was confused.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.248
He couldn't understand.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.085
I don't understand it myself.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.004
Me being in love with Okonogi...

07:02.380 --> 07:04.841
and being unable to ride
Masotan if I fall in love.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.846
There's so much I don't understand that
I don't even know how to think.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.348
I'm so sorry, Masotan!

07:12.432 --> 07:16.436
It's all my fault! I'm really sorry!

07:18.980 --> 07:20.106
Change?

07:20.940 --> 07:23.609
My mama used to ride the OTF.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.572
I don't know I was affected
or brainwashed by that,

07:27.947 --> 07:31.701
but my feelings about wanting
to be a Dragon Pilot...

07:32.118 --> 07:34.620
are starting to change.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.791
So you took this path
only because of your mom?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.710
No, that's wrong.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.045
I really respect Mama...

07:44.005 --> 07:46.674
but I couldn't ride Masotan.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.761
Which means you don't rely much
on others, Kaizaki.

07:51.053 --> 07:51.888
Huh?

07:52.054 --> 07:54.390
Physically, you're a junior size...

07:54.599 --> 07:57.810
but you've got the mind
of a mature, independent woman.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.021
That sounds like a compliment.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.191
On paper I might be a Dragon Pilot...

08:03.900 --> 08:05.485
but I can't fly.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.280
So, I thought if I assisted
with Masotan's maintenance...

08:10.114 --> 08:14.285
then maybe, little by little,
I'd know more about how he felt.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.499
And, I started thinking
of him to be cute.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.044
Though I don't adore him
like Amakasu does.

08:24.545 --> 08:28.841
I think it's the hardest on Masotan,
not letting Amakasu ride him.

08:29.467 --> 08:34.430
But it must be incredibly hard for Amakasu
to just stand by and watch.

08:35.932 --> 08:36.807
Mr. Ikushima?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.852
I too felt it was time...

08:40.603 --> 08:42.480
to make a junior size for you, Kaizaki.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.232
Huh?

08:49.737 --> 08:50.571
Hey.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.574
How you've been feeling?

08:54.408 --> 08:55.701
What do you think?

08:56.077 --> 08:59.455
Since the anastomosis deal,
I haven't been able to board Norma.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.046
You really got me there, Hoshino.
I mean, El.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.507
You're pretty vulnerable to love.

09:09.632 --> 09:14.053
I never thought you'd fall head over heels
'cause I was a little nice to you.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.557
You've got a nice body,
so I just thought I'd play around.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.433
What a waste!

09:20.518 --> 09:22.937
I'll happily be friends with benefits
with you.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.022
But nothing serious.
Give me a break--

09:31.654 --> 09:32.488
Unforgivable.

09:34.323 --> 09:38.494
I'll never forgive myself for being
charmed by you for even one moment!

09:45.668 --> 09:47.962
I want you to reject El Hoshino...

09:48.254 --> 09:50.464
to the point where
she swears off men.

09:50.673 --> 09:54.802
I want you to act like your whirlwind
infatuation has vanished.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.513
I can't do that.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.391
I can't hurt Senior Master
Sergeant Hoshino on purpose.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.811
Then you're okay with
letting her dream die?

10:04.979 --> 10:10.151
If Senior Master Sergeant Hoshino
withdraws from her mission now...

10:11.444 --> 10:14.405
I think you can understand.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.411
<i>You will become a fighter pilot, Hoshino.</i>

10:20.953 --> 10:24.624
<i>You were ridiculed but made it</i>
<i>this far 'cause you never gave up.</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:27.877
<i>That's why your dream...</i>

10:28.419 --> 10:30.004
<i>will absolutely come true.</i>

10:31.297 --> 10:33.799
Friends with benefits, my ass!

10:34.634 --> 10:39.430
I will protect my purity with all my life!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.515
-Your voice is loud.
-Filthy men!

10:41.599 --> 10:42.808
Thanks for waiting.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.853
Here's another filthy man! Get away!

10:46.896 --> 10:50.983
This is soaked in salt and spice
and it's filthy! Good and bad!

10:52.777 --> 10:55.071
Delicious, but filthy.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.822
I'll need some liquor!

10:56.947 --> 10:58.532
Please excuse her.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.578
There's not enough booze!

11:06.916 --> 11:09.460
El, let's sleep in our room.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.337
Please go ahead first.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.005
I'll take her back.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.131
But...

11:14.215 --> 11:17.009
Well, you both are sneaky badgers.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.680
It might be best
to lick your wounds tonight.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.848
All right, be careful.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.202
How about some <i>Joie?</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:46.539
Ms. Sada! You're selling <i>Joie</i>
at this hour?

11:47.039 --> 11:50.209
I shouldn't change the pace
at which I've been going.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.170
Or I'd lose sight of myself, right?

11:53.963 --> 11:56.674
Lose sight of yourself?

11:57.049 --> 12:00.636
I had someone I cared about, too.

12:00.970 --> 12:01.804
Really?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.640
Then what happened with that person?

12:05.057 --> 12:08.310
People...
Well, not just people.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.689
The world, the system,
all of it can betray you.

12:12.064 --> 12:12.898
Huh?

12:13.232 --> 12:14.650
It's obvious, isn't it?

12:15.109 --> 12:17.486
Each person is different.

12:18.028 --> 12:21.157
No one can understand another
in a pure way.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.242
-Then?
-You know...

12:24.452 --> 12:28.205
only Organic Transformed Fliers
will not betray you.

12:28.873 --> 12:33.419
And so, in return we must not betray them.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
-So that means...
-Norma.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.341
Norma... is my everything.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.843
El...

12:41.218 --> 12:46.432
Why did my heart move
for someone other than Norma?

12:47.141 --> 12:49.894
I will not betray Norma.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.979
I will live for my dream!

12:52.313 --> 12:55.316
I want to fly anywhere
and everywhere with Norma!

12:57.109 --> 12:58.611
Right. You pass.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.741
Thanks for the drink!

13:07.203 --> 13:11.290
<i>I thought that Ms. Sada's story</i>
<i>was a very good one.</i>

13:12.416 --> 13:14.001
<i>But, I wonder why?</i>

13:14.543 --> 13:17.838
<i>Why am I not convinced?</i>

13:19.048 --> 13:23.552
<i>Hiso Maso!</i>

13:25.012 --> 13:27.515
PLEASE KEEP THE RESTROOM CLEAN

13:27.932 --> 13:31.477
<i>Maybe I shouldn't run from Okonogi.</i>

13:32.603 --> 13:36.941
<i>I need to face him properly</i>
<i>and verify my feelings.</i>

13:38.859 --> 13:42.446
<i>Why am I brushing</i>
<i>more meticulously than usual?</i>

13:46.992 --> 13:48.202
-Haru.
-Hmm?

13:49.119 --> 13:49.954
Kiss me.

13:50.996 --> 13:51.831
Huh?

13:51.914 --> 13:56.001
When I was in fifth grade, we were eating
Ozoni soup on New Year's.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.044
O-Ozoni?

13:57.378 --> 14:02.758
You said then that you'd grant my wish
if I were chosen as the Key Girl.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.510
So, grant me my wish, now.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.011
Now?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.556
Would you lie to a fifth grader?

14:09.640 --> 14:10.558
Hurry up.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.142
Do it.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.570
Why are you breathing on me!
Ugh, you stink of smoke.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.410
Haru?

14:29.869 --> 14:33.581
Sorry, for some reason...
your tear glands weaken, as you age.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.666
You idiot.

14:37.084 --> 14:37.918
Sorry.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.046
But Natsume, if you don't
want to be the Key Girl--

14:41.130 --> 14:42.673
What? That's stupid.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.801
I was born for the Ritual.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.679
I have worked hard to be the Key Girl.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.431
Why wouldn't I do it?

14:50.848 --> 14:51.682
That's stupid!

14:53.976 --> 14:54.935
Yes, you're right.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.230
Sorry.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.318
<i>For a long time...</i>

15:02.568 --> 15:04.695
<i>I took everything for granted.</i>

15:05.821 --> 15:06.697
<i>But...</i>

15:07.156 --> 15:09.950
<i>what other people accept as normal...</i>

15:10.326 --> 15:12.703
<i>are things that Amakasu</i>
<i>fret and struggle over.</i>

15:13.329 --> 15:17.166
<i>When I saw her search for answers</i>
<i>that were only right for her...</i>

15:18.167 --> 15:22.880
<i>I realized that maybe there is</i>
<i>nothing normal to be found.</i>

15:24.882 --> 15:26.550
You miss Amakasu, don't you?

15:27.009 --> 15:27.843
Masotan.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.054
Masotan!

15:34.058 --> 15:35.351
Amakasu?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.604
You are just like me!

15:39.521 --> 15:41.690
Whenever something happens,
you consult Masotan!

15:42.149 --> 15:44.485
To think that Masotan
will accept everything about you

15:44.568 --> 15:46.403
is much too naive, Okonogi!

15:47.071 --> 15:49.448
But right now I want you
to give up your rights

15:49.865 --> 15:51.575
to consult Masotan!

15:52.242 --> 15:54.036
Rights to consult?

15:54.119 --> 15:55.913
Right now. Immediately!

15:55.996 --> 15:58.457
If I don't talk to him,
my health will decline!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.584
Because you were...

16:00.668 --> 16:03.295
k-k-kissing her!

16:03.754 --> 16:06.173
Y-You were watching?
But I didn't kiss her!

16:06.256 --> 16:07.091
Yes, you did!

16:07.299 --> 16:08.217
I did not!

16:08.300 --> 16:10.302
If you're going to watch,
then be focused!

16:10.386 --> 16:14.932
I'm not a creep! I don't want to watch
people slobber all over each other!

16:15.015 --> 16:18.978
Slobber? I didn't kiss her!
I was just blowing air.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.979
What?

16:21.063 --> 16:21.897
Why?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.694
Natsume's mom taught me.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.862
When Natsume cried as a baby,

16:28.946 --> 16:31.699
if you blew air on her nose,
she'd stop crying.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.994
I was the one who cried today.

16:35.119 --> 16:38.831
You knew each other from way back then?

16:39.957 --> 16:40.791
Yeah.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.254
As people who live to serve Lord Mitatsu,

16:45.379 --> 16:48.257
we lived in a community together
in the mountains.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.428
The boys go to the Air Self-Defense Force
after graduating high school and college,

16:52.803 --> 16:57.099
while the girls trained
to become miko during high school.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.685
Hi, Auntie!

17:00.102 --> 17:01.228
Oh, Haruto!

17:01.645 --> 17:03.355
Did you come to meet Natsume?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.317
Here, hold her.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.946
She will become
the future Key Girl someday.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.789
Why don't you try blowing on her nose.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.221
I've known Natsume since she was a baby.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.475
She's like my little sister.
That's all.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.186
Oh, really?

17:42.269 --> 17:43.812
Don't you believe me?

17:43.896 --> 17:44.855
I do!

17:44.938 --> 17:47.024
Then why do you still have
that look on your face?

17:47.107 --> 17:48.525
I don't know!

17:48.734 --> 17:51.361
It's probably 'cause
I like you, Okonogi!

17:57.993 --> 17:59.411
Because I like you.

18:00.662 --> 18:04.291
It's because I like you, Okonogi.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.709
But that means...

18:08.087 --> 18:08.921
Amakasu?

18:09.213 --> 18:10.214
Stop!

18:10.714 --> 18:15.052
I'm sorry! Right now,
I just need a little more time.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.889
Sorry, Masotan! I'll come by again!
Excuse me!

18:23.018 --> 18:24.812
Please let me board Norma.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.315
What about the possibility
of another anastomosis?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.943
I will not waver!

18:34.154 --> 18:37.241
Senior Master Sergeant Hoshino,
you have permission to embark.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.492
Yes, Ma'am!

18:40.160 --> 18:43.163
Nao! Sorry I'm late!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.708
I wonder if she has left already.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.466
<i>I like Okonogi.</i>

18:55.300 --> 18:58.637
<i>He's nice, he's got a sweet,</i>
<i>bashful smile...</i>

18:58.929 --> 19:00.389
<i>and he's nice.</i>

19:00.806 --> 19:04.351
<i>Even when I misunderstand</i>
<i>and blame him arbitrarily,</i>

19:04.518 --> 19:08.147
<i>he patiently explains things to me.</i>
<i>He is really nice.</i>

19:09.022 --> 19:11.233
<i>He cherishes Masotan, too.</i>

19:11.900 --> 19:12.901
<i>Masotan...</i>

19:43.765 --> 19:45.934
<i>Maso... tan...</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:56.695
What clumsy flying.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.697
Mr. Ikushima.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.949
Just stumbling at a low altitude.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.661
However, her ambitions fly higher
than anyone else's.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.955
<i>Calm down, Sexy Jaguar!</i>

20:07.247 --> 20:08.790
<i>Maintain formation!</i>

20:08.874 --> 20:11.210
Sexy Jaguar copies!

20:13.170 --> 20:14.379
What is this?

20:14.504 --> 20:19.051
A suit I developed earlier in case someone
decided they wanted to ride the OTF.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.138
-I'm not really a Dragon Pilot.
-This is not used for that purpose.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.306
Huh?

20:24.806 --> 20:27.184
It might be impossible
to be used for precise piloting.

20:27.267 --> 20:32.189
But in terms of maintenance, if it is used
for dispersing an OTF's heat,

20:32.272 --> 20:34.441
it may be possible to do a short flight.

20:35.859 --> 20:39.154
The pilot's power alone is not enough
for the flight!

20:39.571 --> 20:42.199
Because we each have our own powers...

20:42.491 --> 20:44.618
they can take off into the sky.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.955
Which means that
by supporting the pilot...

20:48.330 --> 20:51.208
we can all fly together in the great sky.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.962
Perhaps it's only me,
but it's what I believe.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.548
What about you, Kaizaki?

21:04.596 --> 21:05.681
Nao...

21:06.723 --> 21:08.725
For me and Masotan...

21:11.979 --> 21:12.813
She's nice.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.439
Hisone?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.985
Nao is nice.

21:18.443 --> 21:22.823
Mr. Ikushima, Flight Leader Kakiyasu,
and all of the Dragon Pilots, too.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.034
Everyone on Gifu Air Base is nice.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.539
Thank you very much, Mr. Ikushima.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.599
Thank you, Airman 3rd Class Kaizaki.

21:49.891 --> 21:50.726
Yes, Ma'am.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.937
Prospects for OTF heat dispersion
are looking brighter.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.607
But as for the execution
of the Ritual, at this rate...

21:57.983 --> 21:59.109
High Steward Okonogi.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.696
How do you feel about
Technical Sergeant Amakasu?

22:03.780 --> 22:06.408
Kakiyasu, you can't be so direct...

22:09.911 --> 22:11.663
-I...
-Masotan!

22:16.293 --> 22:17.127
Amakasu?

22:18.045 --> 22:18.879
Amakasu.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.006
Okonogi. Nao.

22:21.298 --> 22:25.302
Oh, Flight Leader Remi Kakiyasu
and Commander Sosoda were here.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.638
You've got quite a refreshing
look on your face, Amakasu.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.808
Yes, I was confused about
many things...

22:32.059 --> 22:33.643
but my mind is clear now.

22:35.062 --> 22:35.896
Then?

22:36.521 --> 22:39.941
Yes. It was a simple answer.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.152
I... I...

22:43.695 --> 22:46.948
I will quit the Dragon Pilots
and the Air Self-Defense Force!

22:47.240 --> 22:49.951
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.876 --> 24:22.961
<i>-Going out for drinks.</i>
<i>-Oh my God!</i>

24:23.044 --> 24:25.255
<i>Trading sides dishes we didn't like.</i>

24:25.630 --> 24:28.258
<i>-Going to the movies.</i>
<i>-You're kidding, right?</i>

24:28.341 --> 24:29.676
<i>All of it.</i>

24:29.759 --> 24:31.303
<i>What is she doing?</i>

24:32.053 --> 24:33.805
<i>Shut up, you piece of trash!</i>

24:41.938 --> 24:44.941
