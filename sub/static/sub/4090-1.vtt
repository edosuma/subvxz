WEBVTT

02:07.261 --> 02:10.162
Sit. Sit.
Come back.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.040
A<i> pain au chocolat, </i>
bud?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.375
Please, one.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.713
Bud,

02:27.715 --> 02:30.315
I can't give you no more
for free, huh?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.818
Not every time.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.386
Not no more.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.554
I have to subsist.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.889
I know.
I know. I know.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.390
I--I don't carry money
when I run.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.360
I'll give it to you
tomorrow.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.496
- Tomorrow 100%?
- 100%.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.131
Lou come by,

02:46.133 --> 02:49.835
ask if you're feeding here
too much.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.170
Oh, that's 'cause
he thinks

02:51.172 --> 02:52.671
that I'm coming out
of retirement,

02:52.673 --> 02:54.940
but I'm not,
so this is okay.

02:54.942 --> 02:59.144
If you go back fighting,
you're heavyweight now.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.312
Not middleweight.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.448
- Come on. Let's go.
- Wait.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.449
Bye, Claude.

03:04.451 --> 03:07.252
Come on.
Come on.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.692
Hey.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.493
Hey, Hernandez,
no plantain for Silly.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.495
I'm serious, dude.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.730
She shits on the rug,

03:51.732 --> 03:52.731
and she feels
ashamed of herself.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.533
No plantains.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.705
Why does Hernandez always have
to mop the floor so diligently?

03:59.707 --> 04:00.872
It depresses the hell out of me.

04:00.874 --> 04:01.974
How do you mean?

04:01.976 --> 04:03.508
He's always mopping the floor

04:03.510 --> 04:04.509
like<i> LIFE</i> magazine
is gonna come,

04:04.511 --> 04:05.644
and they're not.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.079
He mops to mop.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.647
You're trying to change
the subject.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.015
From what?

04:10.017 --> 04:12.517
You working with me
training Kid Sunshine,

04:12.519 --> 04:13.652
like we talked about.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.354
I'm going to J.J.'s tonight.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.457
He wants to open a Bud's Place
in the city.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.025
J.J. huh?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.393
Just checking it out.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.761
Just being friendly.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.565
Okay, I'm intrigued.
What's his weight?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.600
159.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.102
We got to get him down
to welterweight.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.104
I thought you wanted to turn him
into Floyd Patterson.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.140
Mercury Williams' people
came to us last night--

04:35.142 --> 04:38.410
$500,000 and 2%
of the pay-per-view.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.112
For WBO at the Garden?

04:40.114 --> 04:42.581
I mean, really getting
shortchanged.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.684
But the point is, it's Madison
Square Garden next month.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.653
Kid goes for
the welterweight title.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.621
HBO wanted to bring
their cameras in here

04:49.623 --> 04:51.790
and shoot Kid training.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.293
"Behind the scenes,"
they called it.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.596
I told them no.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.930
You told them no?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.832
Relax.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.601
The fight is what's
consequential.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.636
Oh, the fight's what's
consequential.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.806
HBO's not consequential.
It's not consequential at all.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.207
It's just
the only game in town.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.610
<i> Boardwalk Empire's </i>
not consequential.

05:12.845 --> 05:16.148
<i> Girls</i> isn't consequential.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.826
Oh, Silly.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.128
You know how much coffee
costs these days?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.930
Uh, a buck fifty?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.598
You say that like it makes
some sort of sense.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.200
It does.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.235
It's a large cup, hot,
doesn't taste like ass.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.604
It's a decent deal.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.606
Can I have a section
of the paper?

05:41.608 --> 05:46.345
You can have the whole thing.
I'm gonna take a shower.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.979
How come you never get
<i> The Ledger?</i>

05:47.981 --> 05:49.514
Who cares what's happening
in Jersey?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.316
I do.
I fuckin' live here.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.351
You do too, you know.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.785
Don't remind me.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.254
No Broadway,
no Derek Jeter,

05:56.256 --> 05:59.057
no Rockefeller Center,
but I got you--

05:59.059 --> 06:01.026
my own personal
national treasure.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.229
You stink.
Take a shower!

06:06.899 --> 06:08.033
Sorry.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.935
I'm not used to you
wanting it all the time.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.269
I always want it
all the time.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.072
I was training.
I couldn't have it.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.409
What the fuck?

06:17.411 --> 06:18.677
The water's not hot.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.312
- Is it cold?
- It's lukewarm.

06:20.314 --> 06:22.180
Better take that.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.584
That doesn't bother you?
Lukewarm?

06:25.586 --> 06:29.187
You really should take a shower
while it's hot at all.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.922
What are you doing
with that pen?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.557
Better if you get
<i> The Ledger.</i>

06:32.559 --> 06:34.059
You're making me
depressed here.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.494
Give me a week,
a week and a half.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.429
All right?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.331
If I haven't gotten something
together by then,

06:39.333 --> 06:41.466
you can--you can do
whatever the fuck you want.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.769
Waitress at Beau Morley's.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.036
You trying to
make me depressed?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.505
I was circling
practical things.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.641
Well, you're making me
practically suicidal.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.610
Give me a week.
Okay?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.011
I know
I've been saying it,

06:53.013 --> 06:55.714
but things
are coming together.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.184
All right?
No red pen for a week.

06:59.186 --> 07:03.188
You're not gonna
make fun of me?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.923
Good.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.894
Let's go see a movie.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.931
Want to see a movie?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.300
You want to see a movie with me?

07:15.302 --> 07:16.301
De Niro?

07:16.303 --> 07:17.102
Yeah.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.403
That is truly terrible.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.738
Well, how'd you know
who it was, then?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.339
Oh, please.
Give it up.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.175
You won't see the
Sandra Bullock movie, right?

07:23.177 --> 07:24.443
Right.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.945
Well, I don't want to see
any action movies.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.947
- Oh--here we go.
- What?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.382
I'm allowed to not want to see
a bunch of people

07:30.384 --> 07:31.983
get killed today,
aren't I?

07:31.985 --> 07:33.485
I don't want to fucking fight
about it.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.320
I don't want to fucking
fight about it either.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.189
Look, just pick something.
I don't care what it is.

07:37.191 --> 07:40.392
I just want to sit
in a dark theater and kill time.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.364
I was thinking
I want to try auditing

07:46.366 --> 07:47.933
some classes at Columbia--

07:47.935 --> 07:50.769
Robert Thurman's classes
on Buddhism.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.237
Robert Thurman?

07:52.239 --> 07:54.639
You say that like
I'm supposed to know him.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.807
I know Thurman Munson.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.109
Robert Thurman was
the first white guy

07:58.111 --> 08:00.278
the Dalai Lama
ordained as a monk.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.181
And he's Uma Thurman's
father.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.183
He's a monk
and he's Uma Thurman's father?

08:05.185 --> 08:06.985
He resigned his monk's vows
of celibacy

08:06.987 --> 08:08.186
and married
a Swedish woman.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.355
Of course he did.

08:10.357 --> 08:14.359
She probably looked just like
Uma Thurman.

08:14.361 --> 08:19.097
What's--what's infinite nirvana
compared to Swedish skin?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.765
That's who you want to be
your teacher?

08:20.767 --> 08:23.368
I love it.
You never cease to amaze me.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.836
He gets a pass

08:24.838 --> 08:27.138
because he crammed with,
you know, holy-moly man,

08:27.140 --> 08:28.673
but the rest of us
can't get a break--

08:28.675 --> 08:30.509
Forget I fucking
mentioned it, okay?

08:30.511 --> 08:33.211
You don't get it.
It's not about being holy.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.547
It's about nothing
being sacred or holy.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.215
Tried to explain it, and
you don't fucking listen.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.817
Right, right.
I don't listen.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.520
It's me.
It's me.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.691
It's better with butter.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.793
There's still time
for you to get some butter.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.596
Please shut the fuck up.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.064
Oh, that's right.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.533
There's no--
there's no trailers here.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.834
Shh.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.035
I told you that
was gonna happen.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.503
You got one of them
Steve Jobs,

08:58.505 --> 09:00.372
and now all you do is check it
and check it and check it.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.773
I'm checking it constantly

09:01.775 --> 09:03.108
because I'm in
a state of disbelief.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.243
Nobody ever fucking texts
or calls anymore.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.045
It's like they gave me
the number of a ghost.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.114
Where have all
the hangers-on gone?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.016
You used to complain
about them being around.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.119
I've lost 73 Facebook friends
in the last few months.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.187
Your shoelaces
are untied.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.325
Are they really
your friends?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.594
Anyways, very least,
you can not check your phone

09:22.596 --> 09:24.329
in the middle
of the movie.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.898
Movies like that
bug the hell out of me.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.767
I mean, why don't they
just move?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.302
I thought the movie
was solid.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.137
So if you don't mind, I want
to be alone with my thoughts

09:32.139 --> 09:34.139
for a little bit before you
pollute me with your negativity.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.941
And where would they move?
Where are they gonna move?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.542
Far away.
You're in love.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.277
Some assholes tell you
not to fall in love.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.879
Move away from
the assholes.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.180
I think wherever
they went--

09:42.182 --> 09:43.481
They went--
please.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.216
They move to Rome.
They move to Paris.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.319
Who the fuck is gonna care?
They can do their own thing.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.820
They can lick pears
and chew salami.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.655
Even if you move,
your problems don't vanish.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.657
They do if your problem
is where you live.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.759
Oh, look!

09:59.733 --> 10:00.999
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.233
It was
spitting something up.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.035
He was not.
He was laughing.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.604
I made him laugh.
You couldn't tell?

10:05.606 --> 10:08.006
Oh!
Ho-ho-ho!

10:08.008 --> 10:10.976
Uppercut, uppercut,
left, right, left.

10:10.978 --> 10:11.977
Right?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.645
Right.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.180
You want money, huh?

10:15.182 --> 10:16.648
They called you
The Saint.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.718
Yep.
You want money?

10:19.720 --> 10:20.719
I'm Ray.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.786
That's good.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.521
Don't be a fuck,
honey.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.224
That's okay, ma'am.
He ain't got to talk to me.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.994
Too bad your saint...

10:28.996 --> 10:30.528
didn't have a stronger chin.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.365
Oh, sure,
you had blazing speed

10:33.367 --> 10:35.800
but no whiskers.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.003
Jesus got hit hard,
but he stayed the course.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.170
Come on, Bud.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.271
You're a fuckin' bum.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.473
What do you know
about saints?

10:41.475 --> 10:43.108
I could smell you
all the way from here.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.309
Oh, so what?
I smell.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.011
You never heard of
Saint Francis,

10:46.013 --> 10:47.078
ignorant motherfucker?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.980
Here, here,
take this.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.882
Oh, no, that's okay, ma'am.
That's fine. I'm fine.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.718
Thank you very much, ma'am,
kindly.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.788
You should absorb some dignity
from your woman, Saint.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.922
Wouldn't kill you.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.357
We're done.
Come on.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.394
Wise men may be free of greed
but not you.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.995
I can't believe you tried

11:03.997 --> 11:05.797
to give that
rambling twat $2.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.365
It's cold.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.134
Yeah, I know.
I'm fucking freezing.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.568
Did I tell you
how those yogis

11:10.570 --> 11:12.103
generate heat in the cold
through meditation?

11:12.105 --> 11:13.571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.407
You told me something about
the breathing techniques

11:15.409 --> 11:17.008
to fire up the heart pulmonary
or something.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.543
That's not exactly it.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.879
Well, it had something to do
with breathing.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.714
Sorry.
I'm not a yogi.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.051
How late you gonna be?

11:26.053 --> 11:27.585
If it goes good, late.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.622
He might want to drink
or watch fights or something.

11:30.624 --> 11:34.392
Text me if you're gonna be out
all night.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.193
Good luck.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.798
Welcome to
The Silver Apple.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.004
I parked out front,
in front of the fire hydrant--

13:26.006 --> 13:27.572
Yeah, that's my spot.
Cops know that.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.107
I got, like,
a shitty car.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.176
Hey,
that's my spot.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.377
Whoever parks there
is with me.

13:32.379 --> 13:36.247
Don't be so dubious.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.083
They closed
your restaurant.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.252
You know, people in Jersey
don't have any taste.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.922
I should have known
not to bother with them.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.624
All that money
down the drain.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.260
What are you doing
for work now?

13:49.262 --> 13:50.562
Lou wants me
to work with him.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.564
Work with this kid,
uh, Kid Sunshine.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.432
Teach him the science
of the game.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.167
Hit and don't get hit,
no?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.502
You say that
like it's easy.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.170
It's easier said
than done.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.905
No, I believe you.
I believe you.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.141
But Lou Powell...

14:05.644 --> 14:07.579
Thank you, sweetheart.

14:07.581 --> 14:11.382
He digs the smell
of sweat and piss.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.785
Lou don't care if
it's MSG or VFW halls.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.854
He's a gym rat.
Well, hooray for him.

14:15.856 --> 14:16.888
Whatever's clever,

14:16.890 --> 14:18.323
but you're someone

14:18.325 --> 14:20.692
who's not afraid
of the finer things.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.026
Am I right?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.562
Mm-hmm.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.197
Yes, that's pure silver
you're holding, by the way.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.299
You feel the weight?

14:30.769 --> 14:32.871
Why don't you come work for me
for a little while?

14:32.873 --> 14:33.872
Hmm?

14:33.874 --> 14:36.241
Pickups. Deliveries.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.676
You go around the city
with Roberto.

14:38.678 --> 14:42.013
Make sure everybody
we associate with is--

14:42.015 --> 14:43.448
is full of good cheer.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.216
I must warn you of one thing,
though.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.517
What's that?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.653
He listens to glam rock
all day on the radio,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.521
so if you're similar to me,
you're gonna have to

14:50.523 --> 14:52.523
figure something out--
some kind of arrangement.

14:52.525 --> 14:56.527
I used to like the
New York Dolls, not no more.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.564
What kind of music you got
on your iPod?

15:02.001 --> 15:04.435
Oh, fuck me.
Is that a Walkman?

15:04.437 --> 15:05.803
Well, I-I got an iPhone.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.806
I just don't have
any music for it.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.376
I believe it's important
to turn yourself completely over

15:11.378 --> 15:14.045
to digital technology.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.015
My entire life...

15:17.017 --> 15:18.349
is in the iCloud.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.885
What kind of music
you dig on?

15:20.887 --> 15:24.255
Uh, Laura Nyro.
It's this beatnik chick.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.925
My--my girl recommended her.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.827
I-I don't really listen
to anything other than

15:29.829 --> 15:31.529
what she has in
her cassette collection.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.965
She never got into iTunes
or anything.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.700
She never even got into CDs.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.303
You know, I never used to
listen to anything.

15:38.305 --> 15:42.006
You know, Lou says
that you should never jog

15:42.008 --> 15:43.374
with music.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.410
Says if you run to
the theme song to<i> Rocky,</i>

15:45.412 --> 15:46.878
you'll just be
a bitch fighter.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.413
Well, he doesn't say
the word "bitch," though.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.881
He says
"sentimental fighter."

15:49.883 --> 15:50.815
Sentimental fighter?

15:50.817 --> 15:52.183
Yeah,
an emotional fighter.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.451
Lou says the worst thing
you can be

15:53.453 --> 15:56.421
is an emotional fighter.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.823
You know,
that's why it's science.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.725
You know, you got to be
like a scientist.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.328
Otherwise, you get all
emotionally involved

16:03.330 --> 16:04.963
and unbalanced.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.298
Yeah.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.801
You see my face
right now?

16:09.803 --> 16:12.971
This is me marveling.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.907
I marvel at you lads.

16:15.909 --> 16:18.042
You're monks in the gym.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.811
The most peaceful place
on earth.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.879
Oh, the sound of the--

16:21.881 --> 16:26.050
the ropes and the bags
and the breathing.

16:26.052 --> 16:29.620
It's funny that it all
leads towards violence.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.825
Hmm?
All that peacefulness.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.060
But, hey,
what do I know?

16:37.497 --> 16:40.431
I know one thing;

16:40.433 --> 16:43.234
I want The Saint

16:43.236 --> 16:45.770
and his scientific mind

16:45.772 --> 16:48.906
on my side.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.309
Roberto fights dogs,
doesn't he?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.077
I got nothing to do
with the dog fighting

16:53.079 --> 16:54.445
and neither will you.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.547
You just go around with him
for a couple of weeks,

16:56.549 --> 16:57.815
and in the meantime,

16:57.817 --> 16:59.984
we start bringing
your restaurant down here

16:59.986 --> 17:02.687
to the West Village.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.925
You mean like it was in Jersey
but in Manhattan?

17:07.927 --> 17:09.427
Exactly.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.363
Oh, I dug your place.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.599
Bud's.
Hmm?

17:14.601 --> 17:18.803
I mean, this place here,
it's all trumps and strumpets,

17:18.805 --> 17:20.705
but Bud's...

17:20.707 --> 17:23.875
An everyday guy can watch
a fight, lay down a bet,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.743
and I'll own it, of course,
but after a while,

17:25.745 --> 17:30.915
you make enough money;
you buy a stake...

17:30.917 --> 17:34.352
We become partners.

17:34.354 --> 17:38.523
I even got a spot
picked out.

17:38.525 --> 17:43.494
So it'll be Bud's,

17:43.496 --> 17:48.466
or it'll be
some other guy's.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.102
What say you?

17:54.740 --> 17:57.375
Let's break out the special
California chardonnay.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.910
Pour yourself a glass too.

17:58.912 --> 18:03.147
Oh, I get to drink
with the big shots?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.616
Wow.

18:05.618 --> 18:09.387
She's not normally
so trenchant.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.923
She must have
a schoolgirl crush on you.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.624
Oh, yeah.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.027
You seen her over
from back in the day?

18:16.029 --> 18:17.762
<i> S.I.</i> swimsuit pics?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.764
Oh, you fuckin' monk.

18:19.766 --> 18:24.302
She was 19
with no top off.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.870
Ow.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.176
She was versatile too.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.078
She could do the beach.
She could do heroin chic.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.214
That was a great time
in fashion.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.817
I miss heroin chic badly.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.320
It'll come back, though.

18:42.322 --> 18:47.258
Emaciated, suicidal teen
haute couture.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.960
Ooh.

18:48.962 --> 18:52.163
Still there
if you look closely.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.403
Yup.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.404
Ah, I forgot.
I gotta--

19:00.406 --> 19:02.740
Hey, Champ!

19:02.742 --> 19:04.008
Hey.
How's it going?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.376
Hey. Why are you so tight?

19:05.378 --> 19:06.844
What's going on?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.079
You're smelling good.
What--

19:08.081 --> 19:09.647
What is that?
What fragrance is that?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.648
What are you wearing?

19:10.650 --> 19:11.816
It's CK Obsession.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.684
You got to let me
borrow that.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.386
They sell it
everywhere.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.656
I want to share with you.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.858
J.J., you got a sec?

19:20.860 --> 19:25.129
I got to jaw with you,
man.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.998
Been watching
MSG fights?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.167
No, I've been with
my friend here.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.035
Can't you see that?

19:31.037 --> 19:33.104
Yeah, I see that.

19:33.106 --> 19:34.705
It can wait.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.807
I can tell you now,
or I can tell you later

19:36.809 --> 19:38.376
and you'll be mad at me.

19:38.378 --> 19:42.647
You'll make me join the
Church of Scientology with you.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.583
Washington went down
in the 12th.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.686
A real barn burner!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.354
Drink.
Come on.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.557
We'll be back.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.859
I know a lot of good shit
about you, man.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.430
They won't be back.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.431
No?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.433
No.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.001
Text Ellen.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.436
I should call her.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.138
Text her.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.073
Tell her you're staying at
a hotel for the night.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.509
You--you're too drunk
to drive.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.077
You are, by the way.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.746
Is there, like, a--is there
a Holiday Inn or something?

20:15.748 --> 20:17.748
Don't know.
Don't do dumps.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.317
Oh, you say that like
I have a choice.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.119
I don't even have
hot water.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.323
We can't have you staying
at the Holiday Inn

20:25.325 --> 20:28.025
all alone and all pale.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.396
I get off in an hour.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.365
I got a guest room
at my place.

20:34.367 --> 20:38.236
You'll have your own bathroom
with a shower,

20:38.238 --> 20:40.238
Bud.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.579
Come on.
Go to his body. Come on.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.682
Side to side.
Side to side.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.517
All right. Good. Good.
Keep coming in.

21:26.519 --> 21:27.551
Coming in.
Yeah.

21:27.553 --> 21:30.021
All right, Kid.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.689
That's it.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.325
All right. Good.
Keep coming in.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.895
- On your toes. That's it.
- All right.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.265
- Good.
- Step into him.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.536
- Good.
- That's it.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.837
That's right.
That's right.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.072
- Get him off him.
- That's it.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.507
Good. Good.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.709
- Stay on him.
- Stay. Stay.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.414
- All right. Back it up.
- Don't let him off the hook.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.982
That's right.
That's good.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.250
Do it again.
That's right.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.852
You're gonna help Lou
train Kid,

22:01.854 --> 22:04.255
but you're also committed
to J.J. Cook.

22:04.257 --> 22:05.423
Right.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.891
Sounds conflicting.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.392
Look, it's not like
I told Lou

22:08.394 --> 22:09.860
I was gonna be at
the gym forever.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.762
I just said I'd--I'd help him
with Kid Sunshine

22:11.764 --> 22:13.631
for this title fight;
by the time we have to

22:13.633 --> 22:15.566
move to Manhattan,
the fight'll be over.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.501
You've got it all
figured out.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.569
You know, I thought
you'd be happy.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.870
This way,
if this works,

22:19.872 --> 22:21.872
you don't have to work
that shitty job.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.675
You could be maître d'
at Bud's like before.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.144
How was the Holiday Inn?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.880
Asleep the second I got there.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.916
Why do I feel like
my good news is bad news here?

22:31.918 --> 22:33.384
It's a big move, is all.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.586
It's a couple U-Haul vans.
We've moved before.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.022
From two blocks away.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.725
Don't you miss having, like,
a big, nice place like before?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.360
That place was party-worthy.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.528
I honestly don't miss it.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.297
To me,
this place is cozy.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.065
Even if we had a baby,
I think we could stay here--

22:48.067 --> 22:51.268
Please, don't
get on that again.

22:51.270 --> 22:53.671
Sorry.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.506
All right,
what's your weight today?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.007
156.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.310
All right, you got to lose
9, 10 in the next few weeks.

22:59.312 --> 23:00.511
I can do it.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.712
Stay away from
the sweet stuff,

23:01.714 --> 23:03.147
and I'm not talking
about candy.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.415
Right.

23:04.417 --> 23:05.883
It's hot in here.
Makes you feel tired, huh?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.084
Nah, I'm fine.

23:07.086 --> 23:07.918
You drink?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.019
- Nah.
- Sleep around?

23:09.021 --> 23:11.021
- Nope.
- That's good.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.624
All right, to the body.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.694
Now to the head.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.996
To the body.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.633
Generate momentum
off the toe.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.535
Off the toe, not the heel.
Come on.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.304
Get it up.
Get it up.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.241
See?

23:30.243 --> 23:32.109
All right.
All right, all right, all right.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.011
Hit the lockers.

23:38.383 --> 23:39.850
Thanks, Saint.

23:39.852 --> 23:40.885
Don't mention it.

23:40.887 --> 23:44.555
Hey,
let me see your hands.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.689
Who taped your hands today?

23:45.691 --> 23:46.891
My homeboy Lonnie.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.292
No more Lonnie.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.527
I'll do it tomorrow.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.863
It's too tight.
There's too much tape.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.442
What are you looking at,
old man?

24:04.444 --> 24:05.810
Nothing.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.278
You're smiling about something.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.581
I suppose
I'm smiling because...

24:10.583 --> 24:12.750
you're having fun.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.418
Hell I am, man.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.886
It's disgusting here.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.688
It's full of sweat
and old memories.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.458
Sure. Sure.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.762
Good night, old man.

24:24.764 --> 24:28.065
Silly, come on.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.308
Silly?

24:37.310 --> 24:38.576
You seen Silly?

24:38.578 --> 24:42.480
I saw her about
five minutes ago.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.348
Silly?
Come on, girl.

24:46.785 --> 24:49.320
Hernandez,
you seen Silly?

24:51.490 --> 24:54.358
Silly?

24:54.360 --> 24:56.861
Come on, girl.

24:58.597 --> 25:00.231
Silly, is that you?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.435
What are you doing
in there?

25:10.510 --> 25:12.042
Hey, chill, man.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.244
Put down the guns--

25:13.246 --> 25:14.211
Is this your car?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.713
Well, look who's
driving Bimmers.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.081
Is this your fucking car?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.482
Damn skippy.
Can't you see the resemblance?

25:18.484 --> 25:19.450
That's my fucking dog!

25:19.452 --> 25:21.418
I know.
I took her for a joyride.

25:21.420 --> 25:22.419
You were training.

25:22.421 --> 25:24.154
Gave your pooch a couple
of frankfurters.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.556
Pooch loves frankfurters,
you know that?

25:25.558 --> 25:26.724
Yeah, I know that.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.725
She'll eat whatever
you give her.

25:27.727 --> 25:28.759
She'll even eat plantains.

25:28.761 --> 25:29.760
Give a pooch fruit?

25:29.762 --> 25:30.761
I don't understand that.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.029
Give a pooch meat,

25:32.031 --> 25:33.564
breed the killer instinct
in them--

25:33.566 --> 25:35.099
that I understand.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.134
Pooch will even eat
another pooch, you know that?

25:37.136 --> 25:38.669
Yeah, it depends
on the dog.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.337
No, no, no.
Any pooch.

25:40.339 --> 25:41.772
Fuck anything too.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.307
Well, the vet
took care of that.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.275
Ouch.

25:44.277 --> 25:47.811
Still, pooch
would fuck anything.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.046
Could you let her out,
please?

25:49.048 --> 25:51.615
Kind of muscular,
your dog,

25:51.617 --> 25:52.917
You ever think
of fighting her?

25:52.919 --> 25:54.585
- No.
- Why not?

25:54.587 --> 25:56.820
It's not just pits.
That's a common misconception.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.389
Yeah, I know.
I'm not into that. Okay?

25:58.391 --> 25:59.623
It's not humane.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.526
It's kind of funny
coming from a boxer, no?

26:02.528 --> 26:03.994
No.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.496
Whatever.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.331
If you ever change your mind,
let me know.

26:07.333 --> 26:11.035
Can make big bills,
the three of us.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.137
Can you let her out, please?
The windows are rolled up.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.905
It's cold; I didn't want her
to catch a cold.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.206
It's fucking frosty
out here.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.008
Please just unlock the door.
I got to go home.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.743
No.
We're working tonight.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.811
Tonight?

26:20.813 --> 26:22.046
Or should I call J.J.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.280
and tell him
you're not up for it?

26:23.282 --> 26:24.815
No, no, no.
I'm up for it.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.750
Great.
Let's rock and roll.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.786
All right, you know,
I got to--

26:28.788 --> 26:30.287
I got to go change.
I'm stinky.

26:30.289 --> 26:35.092
And put on that aromatic
Calvin Klein scent?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.460
Don't fret about it.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.562
We got to get to know
each other anyways.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.697
Oh.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.232
J.J. told me
to give you this.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.803
He loaded it with all that
crappy music you like.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.438
Let's go.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.757
We're gonna have to leave
the pooch in the car.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.026
The guy we're gonna go see
has a cat.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.560
I don't know.

27:43.562 --> 27:46.730
Dude, my boy runs
this fucking joint.

27:46.732 --> 27:49.233
Nobody's gonna fuck around
with my whip anyways.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.935
It's only gonna be
15 minutes.

27:51.937 --> 27:53.203
All right.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.639
We'll be right back.
Stay here.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.145
Yo, check this shit.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.349
Cuban heel, yo.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.784
You know what I'm saying?
Cuban heels.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.585
Yeah, I like--
I like that whole dance too.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.287
Yeah, fucking right
you like it.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.190
That's some fucking
Riverdance shit.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.536
I want to do, like, a crazy
Miles Davis voice for this.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.837
So just play along.

28:26.839 --> 28:27.871
Okay.

28:41.086 --> 28:43.020
Jeez.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.294
Gee whiz.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.096
Can we come in?

28:52.098 --> 28:54.431
This is my pal Bud.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.834
Boy, uh,

28:56.836 --> 28:58.469
I was just getting ready
for bed.

28:58.471 --> 29:01.138
Oh, we just walked up
all the stairs.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.006
Maybe we could all have
a glass of milk together

29:03.008 --> 29:04.708
before bed.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.376
I don't have any milk.

29:06.378 --> 29:09.580
You're being rude,
Stanley.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.956
Since it's your bedtime,

29:18.958 --> 29:21.391
straight,
no chaser.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.862
You owe 10 grand to J.J.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.530
That's more than I owe.
No?

29:26.532 --> 29:28.999
I explained our system to you
last time.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.735
You pay interest for every week
you don't pay.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.272
Don't I know you?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.974
He's Bud Gordon.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.709
Gee whiz.

29:38.711 --> 29:41.011
Why do I know
that name?

29:41.013 --> 29:43.280
The Saint.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.116
Bud "The Saint" Gordon?

29:46.118 --> 29:47.885
I lost money on you.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.156
You beat the hell out of Jackson
for four rounds.

29:52.158 --> 29:55.926
He punches you hard once
in the fifth,

29:55.928 --> 29:57.394
and you're out.

29:57.396 --> 30:01.732
Boy, that was some
disappointment for me.

30:01.734 --> 30:03.133
Yeah, for me too.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.636
With the Garden cheering you,

30:05.638 --> 30:07.371
I thought for sure

30:07.373 --> 30:12.042
this scrawny kid from Atlanta
is not gonna take the title.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.912
He was long,
like Tommy Hearns.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.015
Tommy Hearns
my ass.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.017
He lost his belt
the next fight

30:20.019 --> 30:22.019
to some kid
from the Poconos.

30:22.021 --> 30:26.990
Eh, the whole thing
made me shit funny.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.126
If we look under your mattress,

30:29.128 --> 30:33.897
in a Hefty bag,
there's how much?

30:33.899 --> 30:37.434
$300.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.904
No. $275.
I had Chinese delivered.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.513
Hutch!

30:49.515 --> 30:50.547
Put him down,
will you?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.216
I'm taking fucking Hutch.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.751
You can't.
He'll die without his insulin.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.086
He's diabetic.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.454
Just put him down,
will you?

30:57.456 --> 30:59.523
Wait, wait,
you're good for the money?

30:59.525 --> 31:00.724
Yes.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.259
Or you got somebody who can
lend you some money?

31:02.261 --> 31:03.427
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.895
Please don't take Hutch.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.631
He needs his shots.
You're holding him all wrong.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.433
He doesn't like to be held
like that.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.901
He's good for it.
Look at the man.

31:10.903 --> 31:12.636
I don't know.
It's a lot of money.

31:12.638 --> 31:16.139
Come on, man.
He's good for it.

31:16.141 --> 31:19.443
I'm gonna listen to
my associate tonight, Stanley.

31:19.445 --> 31:23.513
We'll both find out
if he makes good choices.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.616
Come here.
Come here, boy.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.050
Come here, Hutch.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.819
Oh, Hutch.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.287
Stanley,

31:30.289 --> 31:33.523
you got any Chinese food left?

31:33.525 --> 31:35.225
I look fucking amazing
eating noodles.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.760
Look at this.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.098
Hey, uh,

31:41.100 --> 31:43.100
hey, mind if I ask you
something?

31:43.102 --> 31:44.668
What?

31:44.670 --> 31:48.038
Were you really gonna
take his cat?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.306
Dude,

31:49.308 --> 31:51.475
I go into this shit--

31:51.477 --> 31:53.644
I'm Johnny Thunders
going into a guitar solo.

31:53.646 --> 31:57.381
I don't know how the fuck
it's gonna go down.

31:57.383 --> 32:00.117
So what's gonna happen
with Stanley now?

32:00.119 --> 32:02.886
Come here.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.254
Stand here.

32:06.724 --> 32:09.026
Hold on.
Wait.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.360
Have a--
have a baby carrot.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.895
It's okay.
I'm not hungry.

32:11.897 --> 32:13.230
Have a fucking baby carrot.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.299
Have a baby carrot.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.369
- It's good, right?
- It's good. Yeah.

32:19.371 --> 32:20.570
Let me tell you something.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.774
J.J. is interested
in money,

32:23.776 --> 32:26.009
but he's more interested
in people

32:26.011 --> 32:27.477
and owning them.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.413
Stanley owns that apartment.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.049
We let him stay there.
We own Stanley.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.351
He loves owning people,
J.J.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.386
Hang over their lives,
cloud-style,

32:36.388 --> 32:39.289
like a fucking Wu-Tang Clan.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.862
We're the fucking
ultimate wingmen.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.798
Look at that.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.835
All right, let's fucking go.
Come on.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.209
One more collect.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.144
Light load tonight.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.546
But this dude
is into us deep.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.747
It's gonna be tricky.

33:03.749 --> 33:04.748
How deep?

33:04.750 --> 33:05.749
300.

33:05.751 --> 33:06.750
Large?

33:06.752 --> 33:07.751
Large.

33:07.753 --> 33:08.552
He's rich, huh?

33:08.554 --> 33:10.287
No.
Not really.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.990
He lives in a one-bedroom
on West End Ave.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.925
Teacher.
Math, I think.

33:14.927 --> 33:15.926
Math teacher?

33:15.928 --> 33:16.994
Yeah.

33:16.996 --> 33:20.664
J.J. loves to hook
pedestrian people.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.466
He loves hooking
commonplace folk

33:22.468 --> 33:24.534
even more than
high rollers.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.903
I didn't understand it
for a while myself.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.340
How'd you meet J.J.?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.342
2005.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.911
He read about me online.

33:34.913 --> 33:39.383
Local boy goes to Iraq,
gets a Purple Heart.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.918
Article said
I was a super sniper,

33:41.920 --> 33:45.022
killed lots of Iraqis.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.556
I come home;

33:46.558 --> 33:48.625
there's, like, a million
purple flowers in my house.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.093
I thought the guy
was a faggot.

33:52.031 --> 33:56.099
But then the landlord tells me
I got no home.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.734
You ever been homeless?

33:57.736 --> 33:58.769
No.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.772
Those old men
down on the corner,

34:01.774 --> 34:04.508
around an old oil drum with
holes up and down the side,

34:04.510 --> 34:06.676
feeding it whatever,

34:06.678 --> 34:10.047
they pass gloves
back and forth,

34:10.049 --> 34:11.982
stamp their feet.

34:11.984 --> 34:14.017
I didn't last three days
of that shit.

34:14.019 --> 34:15.886
Nasiriyah was easier.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.087
I went to meet J.J.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.855
I've been in business
ever since.

34:18.857 --> 34:23.560
Later I find out he paid
my landlord to evict me.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.795
That didn't make you mad?

34:24.797 --> 34:26.196
Nah.

34:26.198 --> 34:28.732
Showed me what a badass
businessman I was dealing with.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.767
What if you wanted to
get out of the business?

34:30.769 --> 34:33.303
Why would I want
to do that?

34:33.305 --> 34:36.540
Just, you know,
theoretically speaking.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.576
J.J. said you was
one smart bruiser.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.578
"Theoretically speaking,"

34:41.580 --> 34:43.213
that's fucking good.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.015
You're fucking smart.

35:01.866 --> 35:05.702
Even with my tiny,
feminine hands,

35:05.704 --> 35:09.406
it can be problematic to put
these amazing gloves on.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.574
But once they're on,

35:10.576 --> 35:13.210
they're amazing.

35:13.212 --> 35:17.114
In the glove box.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.582
Pass it to me.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.450
Don't worry.
It's not loaded.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.751
Well, then what do you
have it for?

35:21.753 --> 35:23.720
I'm gonna scare the fuck
out of this guy.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.522
You come in with a Beretta
and a silencer,

35:25.524 --> 35:27.290
he's gonna shit his pants.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.726
How many cokeheads you had
to collect money from?

35:29.728 --> 35:31.461
Coke?
J.J. deals coke?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.864
Just pass it to me.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.472
Let's go.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.411
You have the doorman call him.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.779
Colby, ninth floor.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.481
Don't worry.
There's an elevator.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.816
- What do I say?
- Don't say anything.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.317
Say your name.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.052
Say you're here on behalf
of the installment plan.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.120
Simple.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.555
You can't say it yourself?

35:58.557 --> 36:00.157
Dude is scared of me.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.958
He won't let us up if he hears
my moniker or voice.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.727
The doorman will say
there's two of us.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.662
There's a side entrance
around the way.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.497
No cameras on that entrance.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.266
You let me in from inside.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.568
The doorman won't hear you
open that entrance.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.036
It's past the elevator
on the right.

36:13.038 --> 36:16.439
Then we go up together
in the elevator.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.580
Ah. Fuck.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.116
Oh, I should have
fucking known.

36:26.118 --> 36:27.184
I'm so fucking stupid.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.318
Hey, calm down.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.020
Calm down.

36:30.022 --> 36:31.021
God damn it.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.756
I just want to talk.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.426
You want to talk?

36:36.428 --> 36:37.661
Or you want to punch me
in the face

36:37.663 --> 36:38.995
while you strap me down?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.931
Dude, that was, like,
a one-time thing,

36:40.933 --> 36:44.701
and I apologized for it,
like, a billion times.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.304
Bud, could you wait for me
in the car?

36:47.306 --> 36:49.272
No.
Don't go, man.

36:49.274 --> 36:50.674
You want this guy
coming in?

36:50.676 --> 36:52.375
Bro, this is a former
boxing champ.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.643
Think I hit hard?

36:53.645 --> 36:55.178
This guy hits so hard
he should be in jail.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.748
Fuck. Just don't--
Just don't go.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.650
What do you got--what do you
got going on in here?

37:00.652 --> 37:03.153
Little teachers' convention?

37:03.155 --> 37:04.221
No.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.790
Grading papers, huh?

37:06.792 --> 37:09.759
No, I'm just
watching a movie.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.861
I turned down the movie volume
and put on some music

37:11.863 --> 37:13.029
because the movie sucked.

37:13.031 --> 37:17.400
What--which--which--
which movie?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.035
<i> Wolverine.</i>

37:19.037 --> 37:21.338
Bud, I'll be down
in a minute.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.343
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.344
I'm sorry, Silly.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.878
I know.
I know.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.815
It's too much time
in this little car.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.651
We're almost done.
Huh?

37:34.653 --> 37:35.785
I'm not gonna take you on

37:35.787 --> 37:37.387
any more
of these trips anymore.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.688
Okay?

37:41.193 --> 37:42.759
I didn't know
he was coming.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.828
I wouldn't have taken you
to the gym.

37:46.864 --> 37:47.931
We're almost done.
Okay?

37:47.933 --> 37:50.000
We'll be home soon.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.608
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.410
You're thinking,
"What are we doing here?"

38:00.412 --> 38:02.912
Huh?

38:02.914 --> 38:07.083
Well, we're making our way
back to the top of the heap.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.819
I know it doesn't look like it,
but we are.

38:11.255 --> 38:15.358
We don't need no coke-fueled
self-deception either.

38:19.897 --> 38:23.033
No fucking messages
or calls.

38:24.902 --> 38:27.237
Okay.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.739
They'll see.

38:31.375 --> 38:35.111
I'm gonna be held
in high regard again.

38:37.448 --> 38:40.750
I'm a select champion.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.853
I never once doubted it
since childhood.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.155
Not once.
You know?

38:46.224 --> 38:48.058
Cash moves everything around.

38:48.060 --> 38:52.629
Got the money.
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.265
Souvenir.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.500
Our first date.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.269
Keys.

39:02.139 --> 39:04.174
What happened back there?

39:04.176 --> 39:06.810
Oh, my God.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.446
Are you fucking dense?

39:09.448 --> 39:11.081
What always happens, man,

39:11.083 --> 39:12.916
the same shit
that always happens.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.851
That guy had to be fucked with.
That's what we do.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.354
We're in the fear business.

39:17.356 --> 39:18.788
What?
Are you a baby?

39:18.790 --> 39:22.959
Hey, baby. Oh, baby. Ooh.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.961
Anyways, you can talk to J.J.
about that shit.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.396
We're gonna see him
in a minute.

39:26.398 --> 39:29.766
We're stopping by
his new art gallery in Chelsea.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.168
J.J. has an art gallery?

39:32.170 --> 39:33.403
Yeah.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.004
J.J. has an art gallery.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.140
'Cause that's where
the real money is.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.908
'Cause you put shit
in the right frame,

39:38.910 --> 39:43.079
and these fuckin' dopes that
went to Brown and Princeton,

39:43.081 --> 39:44.914
they'll think it's cool,
and they'll be like,

39:44.916 --> 39:47.584
"Here's a million dollars
for that fucking turd.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.852
"Oh, please, come on my face.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.755
I'll pay you a million dollars
for that."

39:51.757 --> 39:53.423
Jackasses.

39:53.425 --> 39:54.824
Bud,

39:54.826 --> 39:58.461
that's Petals,
and that's Kathryn.

39:58.463 --> 39:59.562
We know you.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.864
They know you.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.066
They're card girls
from the Garden.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.335
You weren't supposed
to tell him, J.J.

40:05.337 --> 40:07.404
He was supposed to guess.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.339
Now we'll never know
if he remembers us.

40:09.341 --> 40:11.775
My bad, ladies.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.310
We were just babies
back then.

40:14.312 --> 40:15.278
We were barely legal.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.913
Mm,
and then the years passed,

40:16.915 --> 40:20.016
taking with them
the semblance of youth.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.719
It's not like
we're fucking old.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.754
No.
Not yet.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.856
Get this, Bud,

40:26.858 --> 40:28.158
their first night
at the Garden

40:28.160 --> 40:29.893
was your last night
at the Garden.

40:29.895 --> 40:34.030
See how the past
is not yet finished?

40:34.032 --> 40:37.167
I hope we're not
bad luck.

40:37.169 --> 40:40.003
You were all bloody
back then...

40:40.005 --> 40:42.739
What's its name?

40:42.741 --> 40:45.108
Oh, her name
is Silly.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.111
I like dogs because
they're like people

40:48.113 --> 40:51.281
except they can't talk.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.283
They're like people.

40:53.285 --> 40:56.052
They're like people.
They're like people...

40:56.054 --> 40:58.721
The cement glaze on the floor
I had put in a month ago,

40:58.723 --> 40:59.923
it's from Morocco.

40:59.925 --> 41:02.058
You can get it wet
and not worry.

41:02.060 --> 41:08.164
What do you think
of this piece?

41:08.166 --> 41:10.500
The trailer?

41:10.502 --> 41:12.569
Right.

41:12.571 --> 41:15.572
This is it.

41:15.574 --> 41:19.642
My gallery's first show.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.311
I-I didn't know
that was the art.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.214
It's--you know,
I don't know much about art.

41:24.216 --> 41:25.014
Mm-hmm.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.850
The girls
seem to like it.

41:26.852 --> 41:29.552
This artist is highly
sought after.

41:29.554 --> 41:32.155
No one in the art world
understands how I booked him.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.590
What they don't realize,
of course,

41:33.592 --> 41:36.292
is that while he may have
an MFA degree from Yale,

41:36.294 --> 41:38.127
he's also addicted
to spread betting.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.865
What I like is,
he told me

41:41.867 --> 41:44.200
the silver aluminum
of the Airstream trailer

41:44.202 --> 41:47.871
is an homage to Andy Warhol's
<i> Silver Clouds.</i>

41:47.873 --> 41:49.105
You know Andy Warhol?

41:49.107 --> 41:50.974
Yeah, yeah. I heard of him.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.342
Oh, yeah.
He's my favorite.

41:52.344 --> 41:54.577
He's from my hometown,
Pittsburgh.

41:54.579 --> 41:55.812
We both got the fuck out.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.147
He sure understood
about silver--

41:58.149 --> 42:01.017
how it could appeal
to people's vanity,

42:01.019 --> 42:03.987
suck crowds in with its flash
and its coolness.

42:03.989 --> 42:07.423
See how the Airstream projects
a sexy invulnerability?

42:07.425 --> 42:11.227
You feel like maybe you could be
inhuman, unassailable

42:11.229 --> 42:12.595
in a silver thing like that.

42:12.597 --> 42:14.030
Am I right, Roberto?

42:14.032 --> 42:16.232
I always feel that way,
so I'm a bad barometer.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.267
Mm.

42:17.269 --> 42:19.135
Let's go inside
and have dinner.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.204
I'll show you what I mean.

42:23.574 --> 42:24.974
Oh, Kathryn...

42:24.976 --> 42:27.977
Kathryn, sweetie,
can you just step up for me?

42:27.979 --> 42:29.178
Sure you can.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.214
There you go.
You feeling okay?

42:31.216 --> 42:32.882
Good.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.884
Right this way, boys.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.452
Come on.

42:41.325 --> 42:44.027
I--I don't want to go in
by myself.

42:44.029 --> 42:47.130
Just go in.
I'll be in in a minute.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.598
It's like being in...

42:48.600 --> 42:49.732
Go.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.302
A sleek, fresh bunker.

42:54.638 --> 42:57.173
You should come to my house
in Riverdale sometime.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.575
I designed it myself.

42:58.577 --> 43:01.044
I keep it on the DL,
but if I wanted it to be,

43:01.046 --> 43:02.445
that house would be famous;

43:02.447 --> 43:04.781
<i> Architecture Magazine, </i>
this and that.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.584
It's not that I don't have
a fondness for notoriety.

43:07.586 --> 43:09.719
It's for legal reasons

43:09.721 --> 43:14.891
that I remain...
obscure.

43:16.894 --> 43:19.562
Steve Jobs,

43:19.564 --> 43:22.599
a pioneer of digital music,

43:22.601 --> 43:24.267
his legacy is tremendous.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.169
When he went home,
he listened to vinyl.

43:26.171 --> 43:28.004
You like country music?

43:28.006 --> 43:29.505
Oh, who am I talking...

43:29.507 --> 43:30.840
Mr. Monk.

43:30.842 --> 43:35.044
I play jazz at the Apple
in case a paint job comes in.

43:35.046 --> 43:36.946
You look pale, sport.

43:36.948 --> 43:38.281
I get headaches sometimes.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.582
Oh, yeah.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.150
- Walk on Query Street...

43:41.152 --> 43:42.418
I'm exhausted.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.953
Mostly it's from
being at the gym.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.455
Oh, yeah.
Coming out of retirement?

43:45.457 --> 43:47.190
No.
That's funny.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.892
No, no, I'm just helping
with Kid Sunshine.

43:49.894 --> 43:53.396
Kid Sunshine,
talk of the town.

43:53.398 --> 43:55.098
A week ago,
nobody hears of this kid.

43:55.100 --> 43:57.333
Now everyone's talking
about him.

43:57.335 --> 44:00.737
Champ, you get the little
digital jukebox I sent you?

44:00.739 --> 44:02.438
I did.
Yes. Thank you, J.J.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.141
Silly's hungry.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.777
No, please,
don't feed her.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.278
Hey. Hey, please.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.414
I told you
not to do that.

44:11.416 --> 44:12.749
He likes it.

44:12.751 --> 44:14.417
Don't you?
Yes, you do.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.020
You know, it's a girl.
She's a girl.

44:17.022 --> 44:19.322
And--hey, come here.
Come here, Silly.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.791
- Come here.
- No, she wants the--

44:21.793 --> 44:23.993
What the fuck?

44:23.995 --> 44:25.728
Sit down. I apologize.

44:25.730 --> 44:29.999
The girls will be reprimanded.
I can assure you of that.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.701
I'm a soft touch
for animals.

44:31.703 --> 44:33.469
Here. See this?

44:33.471 --> 44:38.441
I keep her in my backyard
with an electronic fence.

44:38.443 --> 44:41.844
She's just
a little, tiny doll.

44:41.846 --> 44:44.280
Oh, you phantasm, you.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.616
Look at her go.
I love to hold her.

44:46.618 --> 44:48.584
You're not afraid
she'll kill you?

44:48.586 --> 44:49.552
Pussy.

44:49.554 --> 44:50.953
Have you ever seen
anything...

44:50.955 --> 44:52.488
We don't like him, J.J.

44:52.490 --> 44:53.756
So beautiful?

44:53.758 --> 44:56.292
You know, there was never a name
for that color.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.995
We need more blow, J.J.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.602
The snow leopard
is the most rare

45:06.604 --> 45:08.171
and elusive animal
in the world.

45:08.173 --> 45:09.439
It's mythical,

45:09.441 --> 45:12.642
ultra mysterious,
powerful loners,

45:12.644 --> 45:14.911
alone its whole life.

45:14.913 --> 45:18.781
The furthest thing
from ordinary

45:18.783 --> 45:21.884
on this planet.

45:21.886 --> 45:25.221
Ordinary is our enemy.

45:25.223 --> 45:30.093
Ordinary people
doing ordinary things,

45:30.095 --> 45:32.895
like the laundry.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.897
When I left Pittsburgh,

45:34.899 --> 45:36.766
I promised myself
I would never do

45:36.768 --> 45:38.000
those humdrum things again,

45:38.002 --> 45:39.635
and I have not,

45:39.637 --> 45:41.637
and you will not.

45:41.639 --> 45:43.306
You will be burnished.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.942
I will aluminize your world.

45:45.944 --> 45:48.311
You'll be untouchable.

46:00.324 --> 46:02.125
Ellen?

46:02.127 --> 46:04.660
Couldn't sleep.

46:04.662 --> 46:07.296
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

46:07.298 --> 46:09.499
Why are your eyes sore?

46:20.677 --> 46:22.945
Why are your eyes sore?

46:46.671 --> 46:49.939
There's some coffee
in the fridge.

46:49.941 --> 46:54.577
Is it that very ordinary
deli shit?

46:54.579 --> 46:59.682
What's so wrong
with ordinary?

47:05.422 --> 47:07.423
Breathe through the nose
as much as you can.

47:07.425 --> 47:09.325
Keep that mouth closed.

47:09.327 --> 47:12.295
Keep your brain stale.
Keep your brain in your toes.

47:12.297 --> 47:16.065
Let the cold move your brain
into your toes.

47:16.067 --> 47:19.068
Go get some water for Kid,
please.

47:19.070 --> 47:20.469
Small bottle.

47:20.471 --> 47:23.539
I don't want him
drinking much.

47:23.541 --> 47:24.874
Stretch it.

48:15.627 --> 48:19.161
Are you getting the paper
as well?

48:24.101 --> 48:25.368
Would you like
to make a donation

48:25.370 --> 48:28.537
to the Make-A-Wish
Foundation?

48:38.616 --> 48:40.349
Hey, you need me, Lou?

48:40.351 --> 48:42.318
I'm giving Kid a rubdown.

48:42.320 --> 48:45.254
I thought after, you could do
some footwork drills with him.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.390
How about tomorrow?

48:47.392 --> 48:49.191
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:49.193 --> 48:50.359
I'll see you tomorrow, Kid.

48:50.361 --> 48:52.695
All right, Saint.
You good?

48:52.697 --> 48:54.530
Yeah.

49:27.464 --> 49:30.433
- Hola.
- Roberto?

49:30.435 --> 49:33.302
You know what time it is, man?

49:33.304 --> 49:35.204
It's in the fucking paper,
man.

49:35.206 --> 49:36.706
- What?
- You killed him?

49:38.009 --> 49:39.275
You fucking shot him?

49:39.277 --> 49:40.476
Hey, hey.

49:40.478 --> 49:43.446
You should talk to J.J.
about that.

49:43.448 --> 49:45.614
Okay?
Big comandante J.J.

49:45.616 --> 49:46.949
Too high for me, partner.

49:46.951 --> 49:48.985
No, no, I'm not your
fucking partner anymore.

49:48.987 --> 49:50.252
That's over.

49:50.254 --> 49:52.488
I don't think so, man.

49:52.490 --> 49:55.424
Told you J.J. owned people.

49:55.426 --> 49:57.393
One of the people he owns
is Colby's super.

49:57.395 --> 50:00.930
J.J. has video footage
of you in the lobby,

50:00.932 --> 50:03.165
your beautiful face.

50:03.167 --> 50:06.702
<i> Claro,</i> that's not
what the cops have, though.

50:06.704 --> 50:10.072
Our super gave him
some looped-up shit.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.841
You ain't in that version.

50:11.843 --> 50:14.343
Course,
that's how it is now.

50:14.345 --> 50:17.747
Things change.
Your situation is pliable.

50:17.749 --> 50:20.916
It's up to you, bro,

50:20.918 --> 50:23.085
if you want to be
in the clear or not.

50:23.087 --> 50:26.122
Me, I'm gonna cozy on up

50:26.124 --> 50:27.957
and go to sleepy time.

50:31.629 --> 50:33.796
Bye.

50:37.367 --> 50:39.535
Um, it's over on McDonald.

50:39.537 --> 50:40.870
Yeah, it's really nice.

50:40.872 --> 50:43.239
But I only take her,
like, once a year.

50:43.241 --> 50:45.274
And every time,
they tell me,

50:45.276 --> 50:46.842
"She's so big."

50:48.713 --> 50:49.912
Do you want to get that?

50:49.914 --> 50:51.213
Or somebody else got it?

50:51.215 --> 50:52.848
Yeah, I think they got it
in the back.

50:52.850 --> 50:54.350
Yeah, don't worry about it.

50:54.352 --> 50:55.918
- I hope.
- I know. Right?

50:56.921 --> 51:00.022
- Is Ronnie working today?
- Yeah.

51:00.024 --> 51:01.757
Anyway, sorry,
you were saying.

51:01.759 --> 51:03.592
So you only take her
once a year, anyway, but--

51:03.594 --> 51:04.794
Yeah.

51:04.796 --> 51:06.162
Because I always get worried

51:06.164 --> 51:07.663
about, like,
how often you're supposed

51:07.665 --> 51:09.065
to take 'em in for shots
and everything.

51:09.067 --> 51:10.066
- Yeah.
- Anyway.

51:10.068 --> 51:11.434
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:11.436 --> 51:13.502
Were you wanting anything?

51:17.174 --> 51:20.109
Coffee.

51:20.111 --> 51:22.178
You're not eating?

51:22.180 --> 51:23.212
You see these spoons?

51:23.214 --> 51:24.680
The spoons are fine.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.215
Yeah, if you like someone
else's clam chowder.

51:26.217 --> 51:27.616
Picking a fight
with the Starlight?

51:27.618 --> 51:29.351
- Not hungry.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Since when?

51:29.353 --> 51:30.686
Okay, listen to me,
just listen.

51:30.688 --> 51:33.556
Something bad happened
last night.

51:33.558 --> 51:36.459
I didn't know it,
but it did.

51:36.461 --> 51:39.495
I give up.
Denzel Washington.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.597
- What?
- Not Denzel?

51:41.599 --> 51:43.766
It's not a fucking
impersonation.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.668
I'm leaving
if you do that again.

51:45.670 --> 51:47.670
You hear me?
Fucking control yourself.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.205
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:49.207 --> 51:51.941
Um...

51:51.943 --> 51:55.311
Something bad
has happened.

51:55.313 --> 51:58.280
I'm in trouble.

51:58.282 --> 51:59.482
Now you're scaring me.

51:59.484 --> 52:01.851
It's 'cause I'm scared.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.689
Now, look,

52:06.691 --> 52:09.024
whatever I say for the rest
of this conversation,

52:09.026 --> 52:10.493
just act normal.

52:10.495 --> 52:12.394
You're the one who's slamming
the table and making a scene.

52:12.396 --> 52:14.463
Okay, I don't want to get
into a fucking debate about it.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.165
- Just act regular.
- Okay. Okay.

52:18.535 --> 52:20.102
A man was killed.

52:20.104 --> 52:21.203
A man?
What man?

52:21.205 --> 52:23.272
Just some man.

52:23.274 --> 52:25.574
And the thing is,

52:25.576 --> 52:27.843
I'm being framed for it.

52:27.845 --> 52:29.545
Or being threatened
to be framed for it.

52:29.547 --> 52:30.746
Framed?
Framed by who?

52:30.748 --> 52:33.949
What the fuck are
you talking about?

52:39.589 --> 52:43.559
J.J.
That's who.

52:43.561 --> 52:45.027
J.J.?
Why would J.J. frame you?

52:45.029 --> 52:46.929
I thought he wanted to
go into business with you.

52:46.931 --> 52:50.666
He wants to own Bud's
and me.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.669
And I should have known.
J.J. doesn't have partners.

52:53.671 --> 52:56.205
Can he frame--
how would--

52:56.207 --> 52:59.375
how would he frame you?

52:59.377 --> 53:01.210
My prints are on
the murder weapon.

53:01.212 --> 53:04.747
- Murder--
- Shh.

53:04.749 --> 53:08.083
Roberto had me
hand him his gun.

53:08.085 --> 53:11.453
Roberto left the gun behind
for the cops to find.

53:11.455 --> 53:13.856
They got me walking in
on tape,

53:13.858 --> 53:18.160
but that's not the tape
the cops have yet.

53:18.162 --> 53:20.196
I don't know what
you're talking about,

53:20.198 --> 53:21.897
but what are you gonna do?

53:21.899 --> 53:23.966
Roberto's coming by
to pick me up later.

53:23.968 --> 53:26.402
We're supposed to go
on our rounds.

53:26.404 --> 53:28.404
So we call the cops.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.706
My cousin Reggie on the force
in Hoboken.

53:30.708 --> 53:33.542
They got me on tape,
Ellen.

53:33.544 --> 53:36.545
My prints are on the gun.

53:36.547 --> 53:37.813
They got me.

53:37.815 --> 53:39.248
These guys are pros
at the game.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.516
I'm a layman.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.985
Your cousin Reggie
can't do shit.

53:54.264 --> 53:56.966
Who died?

54:00.403 --> 54:03.138
He was a schoolteacher.

54:05.309 --> 54:06.342
Shh.
Shh. Shh.

54:07.478 --> 54:09.144
Don't cry.
Don't cry.

54:09.146 --> 54:10.613
A schoolteacher?

54:10.615 --> 54:12.014
Yeah,
he was also a cokehead,

54:12.016 --> 54:13.983
if that helps.

54:13.985 --> 54:16.852
Come on.
Hey. Use this napkin.

54:16.854 --> 54:21.390
Come on, just act like
everything is everyday ordinary.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.259
Oh, now you want ordinary.

54:41.812 --> 54:44.713
That's good.

54:44.715 --> 54:46.649
Don't get hit.

54:48.785 --> 54:51.553
Don't get hit.

54:51.555 --> 54:53.389
Come on. Push me back.

54:55.426 --> 54:59.094
All right,
pivot off the front.

54:59.096 --> 55:02.331
Pivot off the back.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.400
Pivot off the front
again.

55:04.402 --> 55:05.434
Off the back.

55:07.938 --> 55:09.471
Some water now?

55:09.473 --> 55:11.707
Not yet.
Come on.

55:30.393 --> 55:32.428
Hey, there.

55:32.430 --> 55:35.998
Ellen's walking Silly.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And at Pittsburgh,
there wasn't much else to do

55:38.002 --> 55:40.169
but learn to pick locks.

55:40.171 --> 55:42.604
In fact, this place reminds me
a lot of Pittsburgh.

55:42.606 --> 55:44.940
Faint smell of
Dutch elm disease.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.642
What do you want?

55:48.112 --> 55:49.745
Well, a cup of coffee
would be kind.

55:49.747 --> 55:51.647
It's chilly in here,
Bud.

55:53.616 --> 55:55.150
There's some coffee
on the stove,

55:55.152 --> 55:57.953
if you don't mind it
not being fresh or gourmet.

55:57.955 --> 56:00.556
Not being fresh or gourmet
is fine.

56:00.558 --> 56:02.925
It will complete the experience
of this apartment.

56:02.927 --> 56:04.793
Is the building a landmark?

56:04.795 --> 56:06.995
I don't know.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.998
Worn flights of stone stairs
look like they've seen wars.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.633
I bet, you excavate
the basement,

56:11.635 --> 56:15.237
there'd be armloads of tumbrel
and peasant rags.

56:15.239 --> 56:17.106
I'm sure some fool
wants to preserve it.

56:17.108 --> 56:20.409
It's dark in here, but did you
lose a few pounds?

56:20.411 --> 56:22.010
Possible.
Yeah.

56:22.012 --> 56:24.179
Kid Sunshine, sometimes
it seems like he's training me.

56:25.383 --> 56:27.383
Or maybe you're having
a nervous breakdown.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.551
That'll make people lose weight
sometimes, if you're lucky.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.753
Yeah, maybe that's it.

56:30.755 --> 56:32.121
Kid Sunshine,

56:32.123 --> 56:34.723
I wanted to talk to you
about him.

56:34.725 --> 56:37.092
What do you want to talk
about Kid Sunshine for?

56:37.094 --> 56:40.796
Well, he's got to fall down,
Bud.

57:14.230 --> 57:16.265
Ow.

57:16.267 --> 57:17.800
You weren't kidding
about this coffee.

57:17.802 --> 57:18.901
You got any sugar?

57:18.903 --> 57:20.402
We're all out.

57:21.971 --> 57:23.972
In the first round,
to be exact.

57:23.974 --> 57:25.374
You put your money
on Kid Sunshine,

57:25.376 --> 57:27.075
you're gonna come out
like gangbusters.

57:27.077 --> 57:28.510
That's an inside tip.

57:28.512 --> 57:31.413
This is a great fighter
we're talking about.

57:31.415 --> 57:32.981
He's gonna win.

57:32.983 --> 57:34.883
Oh, that's kindly of you.
The insider's tip--

57:34.885 --> 57:36.785
Let me give you
an inside tip.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.720
I don't dig
taking chances.

57:38.722 --> 57:40.155
I dig sure things.

57:40.157 --> 57:41.623
If Kid goes down
in the first

57:41.625 --> 57:43.926
and I got a ton of money
on him going down in the first,

57:43.928 --> 57:45.561
that is very sure.

57:45.563 --> 57:47.529
Yeah, but is that believable?
In the first round?

57:47.531 --> 57:49.431
That's gonna be shady
to the commission.

57:49.433 --> 57:50.899
Come on.

57:50.901 --> 57:52.401
All fighters are vulnerable
in the first round.

57:52.403 --> 57:53.936
You know that, Bud.
I don't need to tell you.

57:53.938 --> 57:55.437
Hmm, especially
with two knockout guys.

57:55.439 --> 57:57.639
Hell, if you told me Mercury
went down in the first,

57:57.641 --> 58:01.210
I'd believe you, but
it's not gonna be Mercury.

58:03.279 --> 58:06.315
We, um--
we sent the footage of you

58:06.317 --> 58:10.185
in the lobby on the West End
to one of my pocket cops,

58:10.187 --> 58:11.920
and if Kid doesn't go down
in the first,

58:11.922 --> 58:13.288
the tape turns up
immediately,

58:13.290 --> 58:15.891
and the superintendent
will tell the cops that

58:15.893 --> 58:18.694
you threatened to kill him,
thus the cover-up

58:18.696 --> 58:20.796
and the fake tape.

58:22.233 --> 58:25.801
Super used to be
a soap opera actor.

58:25.803 --> 58:29.171
He's quite convincing,
actually.

58:31.641 --> 58:34.009
Come on now.

58:34.011 --> 58:37.479
Hey, hey, hey.

58:37.481 --> 58:39.481
You caught sight of
this side of darkness before.

58:39.483 --> 58:41.717
You knew it was there.
Don't act like a birthday boy.

58:41.719 --> 58:43.619
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe. I just--

58:43.621 --> 58:46.321
why--why do you always want
to send it all to hell so often?

58:46.323 --> 58:48.991
Hell, my friend, is rising
first thing in the morning

58:48.993 --> 58:50.125
and throughout the day.

58:50.127 --> 58:51.793
I'm just a surfer.

58:51.795 --> 58:52.961
Can't you see that?

58:52.963 --> 58:54.663
No, I guess I can't.

58:54.665 --> 58:57.833
Mmm.
Really?

58:57.835 --> 58:59.468
I think you can.

58:59.470 --> 59:02.471
I think you've surfed some
yourself.

59:02.473 --> 59:06.241
Only difference is,
you got rolled.

59:07.877 --> 59:10.212
How about
the Yankees signing, huh?

59:10.214 --> 59:12.848
Looks like they just bought
themselves another championship.

59:12.850 --> 59:16.318
And people say
boxing is crooked.

59:16.320 --> 59:19.021
Prevaricators.

59:26.763 --> 59:30.065
Are we having
an awkward moment?

59:32.635 --> 59:34.136
If it's any consolation,

59:34.138 --> 59:35.837
a lot of the money
we make off Kid

59:35.839 --> 59:37.172
will go straight to
Bud's Place.

59:37.174 --> 59:39.007
I've sketched out
some design stuff.

59:39.009 --> 59:41.376
I'm thinking linoleum,
hyperborean-style.

59:41.378 --> 59:43.745
I know we said it'd be the same
as it is here in Manhattan,

59:43.747 --> 59:46.682
but I need to express
myself creatively,

59:46.684 --> 59:48.183
and a few
clued-in alterations,

59:48.185 --> 59:51.920
I'm gonna make it fit in
better in Manhattan.

59:57.528 --> 59:59.027
Bud's needs some irony

59:59.029 --> 1:00:00.896
if it's gonna fly downtown.

1:00:00.898 --> 1:00:03.265
As it is,
it's too sincere.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:11.907
Also, we'll have
$1/2 million set aside

1:00:11.909 --> 1:00:13.909
for Kid,
to take the edge off.

1:00:13.911 --> 1:00:15.744
He's got the whole world
ahead of him.

1:00:15.746 --> 1:00:17.446
You can't stand it.

1:00:21.784 --> 1:00:24.486
Are you analyzing me?

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:31.326
Don't hurt yourself.

1:00:35.398 --> 1:00:36.531
Tell Kid to call me.

1:00:36.533 --> 1:00:38.433
Confirmation call.

1:00:38.435 --> 1:00:39.935
Put me at ease.

1:01:16.305 --> 1:01:19.708
There's a long limousine
driving by outside.

1:01:21.277 --> 1:01:24.012
I looked in,
but the windows were darkened.

1:01:24.014 --> 1:01:26.048
Thought it was Bruce.

1:01:26.050 --> 1:01:28.583
Yeah,
I don't think so.

1:01:28.585 --> 1:01:29.985
Yeah, you're right.

1:01:29.987 --> 1:01:31.420
The Boss wouldn't be
so ostentatious.

1:01:31.422 --> 1:01:33.655
Sure he would.

1:01:33.657 --> 1:01:35.924
The Boss has hair plugs.

1:01:35.926 --> 1:01:38.193
- No way.
- Yeah.

1:01:38.195 --> 1:01:39.528
Bruce Springsteen
has hair plugs?

1:01:39.530 --> 1:01:41.096
All those guys have hair plugs.

1:01:41.098 --> 1:01:42.597
No way.

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:47.402
You have dinner?

1:01:47.404 --> 1:01:50.372
No. I'm not hungry.

1:01:53.343 --> 1:01:56.111
I'm gonna go
take a shower.

1:02:17.334 --> 1:02:19.701
Can I get in with you?

1:02:19.703 --> 1:02:21.136
Sure.

1:02:54.270 --> 1:02:56.238
I know it's only lukewarm.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:59.307
It's fine.

1:03:01.477 --> 1:03:03.345
You want to hear
some neat stuff I read

1:03:03.347 --> 1:03:05.614
about the Fuji River?

1:03:26.335 --> 1:03:28.537
You remember
that TV show we saw

1:03:28.539 --> 1:03:32.574
about Sonny Liston
and the phantom punch?

1:03:32.576 --> 1:03:35.177
A lot of fighters have dropped
for money.

1:03:35.179 --> 1:03:39.247
A lot of good guys.
It's complicated.

1:03:39.249 --> 1:03:43.618
You have to consider
the men we deal with.

1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:46.254
You didn't drop.

1:03:49.759 --> 1:03:52.627
Yeah, I guess
I was fortunate that way.

1:03:55.097 --> 1:03:58.633
I think
you have to tell Lou.

1:03:58.635 --> 1:03:59.935
No.

1:03:59.937 --> 1:04:04.372
If I tell Lou,
he'll have Kid take the fall.

1:04:04.374 --> 1:04:08.677
He's not gonna let me do
another round.

1:04:08.679 --> 1:04:11.513
Kid Sunshine would be crushed
if he wasn't champ?

1:04:11.515 --> 1:04:15.217
Not even about that
for him.

1:04:15.219 --> 1:04:17.919
If he wins,
it's not about him.

1:04:17.921 --> 1:04:20.822
It's about something else.

1:04:20.824 --> 1:04:23.058
I can't explain it.
It's--

1:04:24.494 --> 1:04:26.294
I wish I was like that
when I was a fighter.

1:04:26.296 --> 1:04:28.597
I wasn't.
I was up here.

1:04:28.599 --> 1:04:32.567
Big ideas.
Big ideas.

1:04:32.569 --> 1:04:34.769
I used to make fun of stuff.

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:39.107
And when people's
love for me cracked

1:04:39.109 --> 1:04:42.277
and I saw that love
for what it was,

1:04:42.279 --> 1:04:45.380
I called them
"player haters."

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:48.950
"Haters gonna hate,"
I used to say.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.155
What a stupid thing it is
to be a player.

1:04:54.157 --> 1:04:55.523
"Meanwhile,
in your life,

1:04:55.525 --> 1:04:59.127
"you hardly notice the world
around you.

1:04:59.129 --> 1:05:01.496
"Lights changing,

1:05:01.498 --> 1:05:05.500
"sirens dying
along the buildings,

1:05:05.502 --> 1:05:10.639
"your eyes intent on a sight
you do not see yet.

1:05:10.641 --> 1:05:14.943
"Not yet there, as long as
you're only yourself,

1:05:14.945 --> 1:05:17.746
"with whom,
as you recall,

1:05:17.748 --> 1:05:22.484
you were never happy
to be left alone for long."

1:05:26.656 --> 1:05:28.156
I don't know
if that was a poem

1:05:28.158 --> 1:05:31.860
or you're just talking
really great tonight.

1:05:31.862 --> 1:05:33.061
Bud?

1:05:33.063 --> 1:05:34.863
Yeah?

1:05:34.865 --> 1:05:36.231
That sweatshirt stinks.

1:05:36.233 --> 1:05:37.532
- Does it?
- Yeah.

1:05:37.534 --> 1:05:39.601
- Sorry.
- I'm doing laundry tomorrow.

1:05:39.603 --> 1:05:41.002
Could you put it
in the bag?

1:05:41.004 --> 1:05:42.370
Yeah.

1:05:46.075 --> 1:05:47.542
Now, you always do laundry.

1:05:47.544 --> 1:05:50.211
I should do that stuff
sometimes.

1:05:50.213 --> 1:05:52.280
I don't mind it.

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:55.784
It's peaceful,

1:05:55.786 --> 1:05:57.585
the laundromat.

1:05:57.587 --> 1:06:01.256
Everything whirling
around in soap.

1:06:01.258 --> 1:06:02.424
I read.

1:06:02.426 --> 1:06:03.692
Do you ever think that

1:06:03.694 --> 1:06:05.160
you'll just go through
this life

1:06:05.162 --> 1:06:08.496
and be forgotten?

1:06:08.498 --> 1:06:12.867
Well, we'll all be forgotten
regardless.

1:06:12.869 --> 1:06:14.736
Even the most famous person,

1:06:14.738 --> 1:06:16.938
someday, no one will know
they were here.

1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:19.741
Brad Pitt, someday,
all his movies will be dust.

1:06:19.743 --> 1:06:21.109
That's fucking depressing.

1:06:21.111 --> 1:06:24.846
I don't think so.

1:06:24.848 --> 1:06:27.115
You should read this book
I'm reading.

1:06:27.117 --> 1:06:31.419
It's all about how the ego
suckers us into thinking

1:06:31.421 --> 1:06:35.390
that we're all separate
from each other.

1:06:35.392 --> 1:06:38.493
But actually,
in reality,

1:06:38.495 --> 1:06:42.497
you, me,
this bed,

1:06:42.499 --> 1:06:43.932
this wall...

1:06:43.934 --> 1:06:45.066
Silly--

1:06:45.068 --> 1:06:46.568
Don't say her name.
She'll wake up.

1:06:46.570 --> 1:06:49.671
We're all
the same thing.

1:06:49.673 --> 1:06:52.507
We're not separate at all.

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:56.044
And this is all
just our mind.

1:06:57.780 --> 1:07:01.149
Is that supposed
to be solacing?

1:07:01.151 --> 1:07:03.852
No.

1:07:03.854 --> 1:07:06.454
It is what it is.

1:07:06.456 --> 1:07:11.159
If this is our mind,
the mind is a scary place.

1:07:11.161 --> 1:07:13.628
It can be.

1:07:13.630 --> 1:07:16.164
Well, there's no way out,
so...

1:07:16.166 --> 1:07:19.067
might as well
learn to enjoy it.

1:07:21.437 --> 1:07:25.974
You got any ideas about
a good way to enjoy it?

1:08:08.785 --> 1:08:11.686
Is that your car?

1:08:11.688 --> 1:08:13.121
Yeah.

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:17.158
Is there someone in it?

1:10:16.345 --> 1:10:17.979
What's wrong?

1:10:17.981 --> 1:10:19.080
You're sad.

1:10:19.082 --> 1:10:20.782
Well,

1:10:20.784 --> 1:10:22.150
lonely.

1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:26.521
Maybe it's just it being
Christmas Eve and all.

1:10:26.523 --> 1:10:29.490
I get lonely
around Christmas.

1:10:29.492 --> 1:10:31.392
They kill so many trees.

1:10:31.394 --> 1:10:33.695
Statistics
are reprehensible.

1:10:36.465 --> 1:10:37.899
Oh, shit.
Did you hear that?

1:10:37.901 --> 1:10:40.068
What?

1:10:40.070 --> 1:10:41.736
I think I hear

1:10:41.738 --> 1:10:43.838
thousands of trees crying.

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:44.639
Shut up.

1:10:45.642 --> 1:10:47.308
It's not funny.

1:10:47.310 --> 1:10:50.278
- It's a little funny.
- It's not funny!

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:53.448
Asshole.

1:10:53.450 --> 1:10:54.449
Oh, yeah?

1:10:54.451 --> 1:10:58.386
Oh, yeah, bring it.

1:11:00.756 --> 1:11:02.223
This is the most gourmet shit
I ever had.

1:11:02.225 --> 1:11:05.727
I can't seem to find
my appetite for it.

1:11:05.729 --> 1:11:07.095
What is that again?

1:11:07.097 --> 1:11:10.598
It's...scallops
with raisins, basically.

1:11:11.601 --> 1:11:12.900
What's that?

1:11:12.902 --> 1:11:15.136
This is the egg caviar.

1:11:15.138 --> 1:11:16.137
Good?

1:11:16.139 --> 1:11:17.138
No.

1:11:17.941 --> 1:11:19.173
You ever had caviar before?

1:11:19.175 --> 1:11:20.375
No.

1:11:20.377 --> 1:11:21.843
I figured as long as
the hotel is paying for it,

1:11:21.845 --> 1:11:24.279
I should try it,
but...

1:11:24.281 --> 1:11:25.513
it's kind of funky.

1:11:26.983 --> 1:11:28.583
You know, Kid can't eat
before his weigh-in,

1:11:28.585 --> 1:11:33.021
but he's not missing much.

1:11:33.023 --> 1:11:34.589
You got a phone call
this morning

1:11:34.591 --> 1:11:36.090
from a woman named Mae.

1:11:36.092 --> 1:11:38.059
You were out with Silly.
It was an unknown number.

1:11:38.061 --> 1:11:39.761
I thought it might be best
if I answered,

1:11:39.763 --> 1:11:42.630
considering everything
that's going on.

1:11:42.632 --> 1:11:44.666
She sounded very strange
when she heard my voice.

1:11:44.668 --> 1:11:46.367
Then she said,

1:11:46.369 --> 1:11:48.670
"Merry Christmas"
and to wish you luck.

1:11:48.672 --> 1:11:49.871
That's all.

1:11:49.873 --> 1:11:51.639
Okay.

1:11:51.641 --> 1:11:53.174
- She works for J.J., right?
- Yeah.

1:11:53.176 --> 1:11:55.276
- I think I've seen her before.
- Yeah, yeah, probably.

1:11:55.278 --> 1:11:57.545
She was at some of my fights
back in the day.

1:11:57.547 --> 1:11:59.614
Look up at me, Bud.

1:12:01.884 --> 1:12:04.285
When people ask about you,

1:12:04.287 --> 1:12:07.989
I don't tell them
everything that I know.

1:12:07.991 --> 1:12:10.892
You haven't always
been good to me.

1:12:12.194 --> 1:12:13.895
Breaks my heart.

1:12:16.832 --> 1:12:20.168
I love you so much,
but...

1:12:20.170 --> 1:12:24.072
I don't know if I can
be your girl anymore.

1:12:32.181 --> 1:12:34.282
I'll always be
your friend,

1:12:34.284 --> 1:12:36.951
but--

1:12:36.953 --> 1:12:39.120
I got to look out for myself
a little bit.

1:12:39.122 --> 1:12:40.822
You know?

1:12:56.338 --> 1:13:00.408
All those lights
and all those buildings...

1:13:02.077 --> 1:13:06.080
You know, if I--
if I could do it over again,

1:13:06.082 --> 1:13:09.617
I'd do it--
I would have married you.

1:13:09.619 --> 1:13:11.619
I would have had
a little baby with you.

1:13:11.621 --> 1:13:14.789
No, you wouldn't,
Bud.

1:13:14.791 --> 1:13:17.125
You're gonna do this
to me now?

1:13:17.127 --> 1:13:18.860
Out of nowhere,
you're just gonna do this?

1:13:18.862 --> 1:13:20.361
You're supposed to be
my fucking friend.

1:13:20.363 --> 1:13:22.430
You know I'm your
fucking friend.

1:13:22.432 --> 1:13:23.931
We're not happy, Bud.

1:13:23.933 --> 1:13:25.066
You fuck around on me.

1:13:25.068 --> 1:13:26.401
So you don't love me
anymore?

1:13:26.403 --> 1:13:27.769
I'll always love you.

1:13:27.771 --> 1:13:29.604
But you're not, like,
in love with me anymore?

1:13:29.606 --> 1:13:31.105
Not--not enough
to make it work.

1:13:31.107 --> 1:13:32.673
'Cause if you were
in love with me,

1:13:32.675 --> 1:13:35.209
we could make this function;
I-I could change.

1:13:35.211 --> 1:13:36.244
People can change.

1:13:36.246 --> 1:13:37.879
That's the whole Buddha thing,
right?

1:13:37.881 --> 1:13:39.480
I mean, things are always
changing.

1:13:39.482 --> 1:13:42.216
A couple months ago, you said,
"Let's do couples therapy."

1:13:42.218 --> 1:13:44.152
I said no, like a fuck-head,
but I would do it.

1:13:44.154 --> 1:13:48.856
I would do that couples
therapy shit with you.

1:13:48.858 --> 1:13:50.291
So you're gonna leave me too,
huh?

1:13:50.293 --> 1:13:51.959
You're gonna turn on me
just like everyone else

1:13:51.961 --> 1:13:53.194
now that I'm not
the man anymore.

1:13:53.196 --> 1:13:54.896
That shit is in your head,
Bud.

1:13:54.898 --> 1:13:57.131
That is your dumb
ESPN-conditioned version

1:13:57.133 --> 1:13:59.200
of the universe where
you're completely dependent

1:13:59.202 --> 1:14:01.202
on outside circumstances
and just crumble

1:14:01.204 --> 1:14:04.071
the second someone
doesn't bow to you.

1:14:04.073 --> 1:14:06.908
I loved you despite all that
neurotic, infantile

1:14:06.910 --> 1:14:09.043
football shit.

1:14:28.397 --> 1:14:30.731
It's icy streets.
Careful driving. Okay?

1:14:30.733 --> 1:14:32.500
Okay.

1:14:36.839 --> 1:14:38.306
Hey, when you walk Silly,
just make sure

1:14:38.308 --> 1:14:40.007
she doesn't eat anything
off the street.

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:41.542
I know. I know.
I won't.

1:14:41.544 --> 1:14:43.010
'Cause she wants to eat, like,
chicken bones and shit.

1:14:43.012 --> 1:14:44.412
That stuff will kill her.

1:14:44.414 --> 1:14:46.080
I'm the one who told you
about the chicken bones.

1:14:46.082 --> 1:14:47.582
You really are a fruitcake
if you think that's true.

1:14:47.584 --> 1:14:49.383
Wow. I'm not even getting
into that with you.

1:14:49.385 --> 1:14:51.018
You're fucking nuts
if you think that,

1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:52.553
because I told you
about the chicken bones

1:14:52.555 --> 1:14:54.088
when I first met Silly
'cause you had no idea.

1:14:54.090 --> 1:14:55.623
Okay, whatever you say,
cuckoo.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:57.625
Just--I mean,
the main thing is,

1:14:57.627 --> 1:14:59.093
we agree on her diet.

1:14:59.095 --> 1:15:00.495
I won't let her
eat off the street.

1:15:00.497 --> 1:15:01.496
- Okay, I promise.
- Okay.

1:16:11.568 --> 1:16:13.334
Hello?

1:16:14.803 --> 1:16:18.139
My mom always told me
to stay in Montana.

1:16:18.141 --> 1:16:21.576
I thought Montana
was for squares.

1:16:21.578 --> 1:16:24.545
I had a poster of the
Chrysler Building in my room.

1:16:24.547 --> 1:16:26.247
Stared at it for hours.

1:16:26.249 --> 1:16:29.817
Metal and stainless steel.

1:16:29.819 --> 1:16:31.185
My goal was to come here

1:16:31.187 --> 1:16:33.821
and become one of those
Chrysler eagles.

1:16:33.823 --> 1:16:35.890
Who knows?

1:16:35.892 --> 1:16:38.960
Maybe I achieved my goal.

1:16:44.967 --> 1:16:46.400
I know it was J.J.

1:16:46.402 --> 1:16:48.669
who had you go down that night
in the fifth.

1:16:48.671 --> 1:16:51.172
Even Lou Powell bought it
'cause you got hit so hard

1:16:51.174 --> 1:16:53.207
and you were known
for being chinny.

1:16:53.209 --> 1:16:58.079
You didn't open your restaurant
on bank loans.

1:16:58.081 --> 1:17:00.514
Look, I'm not judgy.
I understand.

1:17:00.516 --> 1:17:03.050
You wanted to get out
while your brain worked

1:17:03.052 --> 1:17:05.219
and still have something
to show for it.

1:17:05.221 --> 1:17:08.122
You could win more by losing.

1:17:17.499 --> 1:17:20.501
You know, we could have
a really good time.

1:17:20.503 --> 1:17:21.602
Don't be so prideful.

1:17:21.604 --> 1:17:23.437
Sometimes I get
these headaches.

1:17:23.439 --> 1:17:25.439
I used to tell myself
it was because of the punch,

1:17:25.441 --> 1:17:29.176
but I think a person's
conscience can take on

1:17:29.178 --> 1:17:32.346
all sorts of physical
manifestations.

1:17:32.348 --> 1:17:34.649
J.J. always said
you're one of the smart ones.

1:17:34.651 --> 1:17:35.883
Maybe too smart.

1:17:35.885 --> 1:17:37.184
No such thing.

1:17:37.186 --> 1:17:39.553
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

1:17:39.555 --> 1:17:41.589
But, you know,
if I get a good lawyer--

1:17:41.591 --> 1:17:43.491
I'm guilty of a lot of things,
but murder's not one of them.

1:17:43.493 --> 1:17:46.827
You don't want
to fight him.

1:17:46.829 --> 1:17:48.829
You know, you're looking at me
like I'm ugly.

1:17:48.831 --> 1:17:50.131
Wasn't I pretty yesterday?

1:17:50.133 --> 1:17:52.366
You still are.
I'm somewhere else.

1:17:52.368 --> 1:17:55.903
God, I wish
I could convince you.

1:17:55.905 --> 1:17:57.238
The times we'd have...

1:17:57.240 --> 1:17:59.240
Yeah?
You'd take me to Montana?

1:17:59.242 --> 1:18:00.474
Show me the fields?

1:18:00.476 --> 1:18:01.776
If you wanted.

1:18:01.778 --> 1:18:03.310
I'm not completely sure
if they're still there

1:18:03.312 --> 1:18:05.012
or if I could even
find them.

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:07.214
They're still there.

1:18:07.216 --> 1:18:09.417
I think I'm all
turned around.

1:18:11.420 --> 1:18:14.622
I should get back
to Kid.

1:18:18.026 --> 1:18:21.095
Don't try to go straight
on a crooked road.

1:18:21.097 --> 1:18:23.664
You'll only get flattened.

1:18:43.619 --> 1:18:46.854
Bud?

1:19:06.476 --> 1:19:09.210
Sir, do me a favor
and turn off the music.

1:19:09.212 --> 1:19:11.378
Sorry. What?

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:13.914
Sir, do me a favor.
Turn off the music.

1:19:13.916 --> 1:19:16.984
You want me--
you want another station?

1:19:16.986 --> 1:19:18.586
No station.

1:19:44.647 --> 1:19:46.747
Hey, Kid's not taking
any visitors.

1:19:46.749 --> 1:19:47.882
Sorry.

1:19:47.884 --> 1:19:51.552
I'm visiting you.
Not Kid.

1:19:56.491 --> 1:19:58.459
J.J. asked me
to check in with you.

1:19:59.661 --> 1:20:01.328
You checked in.

1:20:05.967 --> 1:20:08.903
Is there a trace of defiance
in your demeanor,

1:20:08.905 --> 1:20:10.771
or did I mistake?

1:20:10.773 --> 1:20:11.939
You mistake.

1:20:11.941 --> 1:20:13.407
Look, what can I do for you?

1:20:13.409 --> 1:20:16.177
Why are you acting like
you don't know me, man?

1:20:16.179 --> 1:20:18.512
I'm not.

1:20:18.514 --> 1:20:20.848
Whatever, dude.
Be that way.

1:20:22.918 --> 1:20:25.419
Kid never called J.J.

1:20:25.421 --> 1:20:27.655
That's somewhat discourteous,
don't you think?

1:20:27.657 --> 1:20:28.789
Discourteous?

1:20:28.791 --> 1:20:31.292
I'm sure he didn't mean it
that way.

1:20:31.294 --> 1:20:34.094
So it's just an oversight?

1:20:34.096 --> 1:20:35.896
The kid's gonna do
what he's supposed to do?

1:20:35.898 --> 1:20:37.231
Kid's gonna do what
he's supposed to do.

1:20:37.233 --> 1:20:40.434
Actually, I should
get back to Kid.

1:20:40.436 --> 1:20:42.970
Hell, why do you have to
get back to Kid?

1:20:42.972 --> 1:20:45.306
Get back to Kid.

1:20:45.308 --> 1:20:46.640
I can't believe
you're gonna act

1:20:46.642 --> 1:20:49.643
all cold and shit
with me, man.

1:20:49.645 --> 1:20:52.112
Your fucking dice
are loaded.

1:20:52.114 --> 1:20:55.449
Make no mistake,
people like us,

1:20:55.451 --> 1:21:00.421
we're made to go to war
as entertainment for the rich.

1:21:00.423 --> 1:21:03.924
This world is run by a pack
of ferociously ambitious

1:21:03.926 --> 1:21:07.928
teenage girls
at the Saint Anne School.

1:21:07.930 --> 1:21:10.931
This shit going down,
honor just don't apply.

1:21:10.933 --> 1:21:14.535
There ain't no fucking honor
possible in this situation.

1:21:14.537 --> 1:21:17.171
It's, are you smart,
or are you stupid?

1:21:17.173 --> 1:21:18.505
And you're smart, Spartacus.

1:21:18.507 --> 1:21:19.874
So don't be stupid.

1:21:19.876 --> 1:21:21.041
Okay.

1:21:21.043 --> 1:21:22.910
'Cause you're fucking smart.

1:21:24.946 --> 1:21:28.515
They didn't count on
chop-shop parts like us--

1:21:28.517 --> 1:21:31.886
motherfuckers with fox brains
to outwit the system.

1:21:33.822 --> 1:21:36.190
I know it seems like I'm asking
you to betray your friend,

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:37.591
but what I'm really
asking you to do

1:21:37.593 --> 1:21:39.493
is to be enterprising
and entrepreneurial,

1:21:39.495 --> 1:21:42.863
because suffice it to say
that I fucking love you, man.

1:21:46.534 --> 1:21:49.670
So I'll see you
after the fight.

1:21:49.672 --> 1:21:52.873
Condolences to Lou
and Kid.

1:21:54.209 --> 1:21:56.543
And, hey, man,
J.J. says you got to get

1:21:56.545 --> 1:21:58.712
your Twitter follower numbers
way up.

1:21:58.714 --> 1:22:00.881
You got, like,
no one following you.

1:22:00.883 --> 1:22:03.918
And you're tweeting
in the wind.

1:22:18.266 --> 1:22:21.068
Who was that?

1:22:21.070 --> 1:22:23.837
Roberto, J.J.'s guy.

1:22:26.474 --> 1:22:28.509
What'd he want?

1:22:34.849 --> 1:22:36.550
Plainly see he's overwhelmed.

1:22:36.552 --> 1:22:38.352
Mercury Williams
has too much power...

1:22:38.354 --> 1:22:41.021
Everyone's going one way;
you're going the other.

1:22:41.023 --> 1:22:42.022
- What?
- Where to?

1:22:42.024 --> 1:22:43.290
Nowhere.

1:22:43.292 --> 1:22:44.692
Could you just, like,
drive around?

1:22:44.694 --> 1:22:45.893
- You want to see the sights?
- No, no, no.

1:22:45.895 --> 1:22:47.161
I've seen the sights.

1:22:47.163 --> 1:22:48.462
Just drive around wherever.
Okay?

1:22:48.464 --> 1:22:49.897
You want to turn up
the radio now?

1:22:49.899 --> 1:22:51.699
I got to hear this.

1:22:51.701 --> 1:22:53.934
Yeah, I can turn
the radio up.

1:22:53.936 --> 1:22:56.804
You don't got to
attitudinize me about it.

1:22:56.806 --> 1:22:58.005
Sorry.

1:22:58.007 --> 1:23:00.174
Kid Sunshine grabbing Mercury.

1:23:00.176 --> 1:23:01.942
Holds on to him
for dear life.

1:23:01.944 --> 1:23:03.410
The crowd begins to boo.

1:23:03.412 --> 1:23:05.913
Referee Smith has to
break the fighters up.

1:23:05.915 --> 1:23:08.282
Kid Sunshine's mouth
is bleeding badly.

1:23:08.284 --> 1:23:09.616
Ay-yi-yi.

1:23:09.618 --> 1:23:11.318
Now Smith checks to see...

1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:12.686
It's a massacre.

1:23:12.688 --> 1:23:14.221
If Sunshine can continue.

1:23:14.223 --> 1:23:16.390
And Sunshine is saying he can.

1:23:16.392 --> 1:23:18.792
So here we go.
Fight is back on.

1:23:18.794 --> 1:23:20.694
And here comes Mercury again.

1:23:20.696 --> 1:23:22.162
Mercury comes in
with the left hook.

1:23:22.164 --> 1:23:25.032
Kid Sunshine ducks it.
Hits Mercury in the ribs hard!

1:23:25.034 --> 1:23:27.301
Well, there's some life
from the Kid.

1:23:27.303 --> 1:23:28.969
- Where did that come from?
- Wowee!

1:23:28.971 --> 1:23:31.438
Well, that's what
Mercury Williams is wondering.

1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:32.806
He looks angry.

1:23:32.808 --> 1:23:35.175
He chases Sunshine
into the corner

1:23:35.177 --> 1:23:36.910
and lands
a hard body punch,

1:23:36.912 --> 1:23:39.046
but Sunshine slides out
of the corner

1:23:39.048 --> 1:23:42.549
before Mercury can start
any kind of combination.

1:23:42.551 --> 1:23:44.685
Mercury chases after
the Kid.

1:23:44.687 --> 1:23:46.954
Kid Sunshine stops
in his tracks

1:23:46.956 --> 1:23:48.389
and throws a right hand.

1:23:48.391 --> 1:23:50.190
Was that a right-hand lead?

1:23:50.192 --> 1:23:51.325
I think it was, Joe.

1:23:51.327 --> 1:23:52.960
A right-hand lead!

1:23:52.962 --> 1:23:55.496
- And Mercury Williams is hurt!
- Oh, mama!

1:23:56.899 --> 1:23:58.766
Mercury shakes it off,
comes after Sunshine,

1:23:58.768 --> 1:24:01.168
jabs some at Sunshine's head,
but Sunshine blocks.

1:24:01.170 --> 1:24:02.603
They circle...

1:24:02.605 --> 1:24:04.772
And there's the bell.
The round is over.

1:24:04.774 --> 1:24:07.141
Fans are on their feet,
loving it.

1:24:07.143 --> 1:24:08.475
An action fight.

1:24:08.477 --> 1:24:10.477
Shit. What the hell?

1:24:10.479 --> 1:24:11.779
What did I do?

1:24:13.883 --> 1:24:15.883
You didn't do anything wrong.
Don't worry.

1:24:15.885 --> 1:24:19.286
- They want me.
- What did you do?

1:24:19.288 --> 1:24:20.521
Come on.

1:24:24.126 --> 1:24:25.993
Right-hand lead.
