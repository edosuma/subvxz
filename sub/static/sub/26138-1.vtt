WEBVTT

03:24.417 --> 03:26.458
-Am I being accused of anything?
-Not yet.

03:26.625 --> 03:30.917
-But we all know why we're here.
-You have some things to explain.

03:31.083 --> 03:36.000
The money, Mr van Hall. We want
to know exactly how much it was.

03:36.167 --> 03:40.375
-And how you got your hands on it.
-And where it is now.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.542
Because you have no idea.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.917
Just start from the beginning.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.458
It began with my brother.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.958
It all began with Wally.

04:07.292 --> 04:09.083
Dad, is this alright?

04:09.250 --> 04:12.042
You're a little mountain goat.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.875
Nothing will happen.

04:19.041 --> 04:23.083
Pull yourself up on that branch.
Good, that's it.

04:23.167 --> 04:26.708
Not that one, that one's rotten.
Good, now up.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.708
Very good. Look, there you are,
the king of the tree.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.875
Ah, this is where you are.

04:33.042 --> 04:36.000
Look how high we dare to go.
Attie is already in the top.

04:36.750 --> 04:41.625
-They're your guests, darling.
-Yes, I know. We're coming.

04:41.792 --> 04:45.917
Yes, one foot here.
Very good, don't be afraid.

04:46.042 --> 04:49.417
Come, Attie. Yes, put your foot down.
Place it right here.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.042
Sorry, I needed some air.

04:53.542 --> 04:56.333
-Hey, kids.
-Hi, uncle Jaap.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.083
Good to see you.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.083
-Van Hall.
-Henri.

05:05.250 --> 05:08.125
-Congratulations.
-Thanks. Yes, 25, nice age.

05:08.292 --> 05:12.833
-You wish. Do I see some grey hair?
-No, that's the light.

05:14.708 --> 05:17.667
Wally, what do you think
about Rost van Tonningen?

05:17.833 --> 05:19.417
We've got to do something.

05:19.583 --> 05:24.375
There's nothing we can do. That Nazi
will let us pay for our own occupation.

05:24.542 --> 05:27.792
-What if he starts printing extra money?
-Inflation?

05:27.958 --> 05:30.458
At the department
we also worry about that.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.667
That's why I'm glad that as of today

05:35.750 --> 05:39.250
I'll be at the helm of
the Dutch State Bank.

05:39.667 --> 05:46.375
We're in the middle of one of the greatest
revolutions in European history.

05:47.875 --> 05:51.542
Capitalist democracy has bled to death.

05:51.708 --> 05:56.375
That's not just
a National Socialist view, it's a fact.

05:56.542 --> 06:01.000
But within the Dutch State Bank
there's no room for political opinions.

06:01.167 --> 06:03.792
We're here for the people.

06:03.958 --> 06:09.542
That requires supportive collaboration
with nations of the same race.

06:09.708 --> 06:11.083
-I can't listen to this.
-Quiet.

06:11.250 --> 06:16.042
It is my heartfelt wish
that the staff of the Dutch State Bank

06:16.208 --> 06:19.875
will be an example to our people.

06:20.042 --> 06:24.667
Every patriotic Dutchman
wants to see this people happy.

06:32.917 --> 06:35.208
The best ration cards could get me.

06:36.542 --> 06:39.083
Why don't you take the boat out today?

06:41.667 --> 06:45.792
If I do, I need two very sturdy sailors.

06:49.167 --> 06:54.625
Hold the tiller. Attie, look under the
foremast if you see anyone coming.

06:54.792 --> 06:58.000
If you see anyone,
make sure to warn us.

06:58.167 --> 07:02.292
Do you see the mill over there?
Keep your eyes on it.

07:02.792 --> 07:06.083
Very good. Now pull tight.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.542
Let it veer just a little.

07:11.917 --> 07:15.792
The next time let the jib out at once.
And don't tack too fast.

07:18.083 --> 07:21.833
-Little pirate.
-Wasn't your grandpa a pirate?

07:22.000 --> 07:26.208
Not my grandpa, the brother of your
great-great-great-grandfather, Adriaan.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.833
-Really?
-Yes, really.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.500
And his brother Maurits was a soldier
who fought against the King of Prussia.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.292
-Prussia?
-Germany.

07:35.458 --> 07:39.875
-He was in the regiment van Tuyl.
-Van Tuyl? Who was that?

07:40.042 --> 07:44.250
Someone who hated the Germans.

07:44.417 --> 07:49.083
-But I'd much rather be a pirate.
-Then why do you work at a bank?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.958
Mrs van Veen?

08:23.125 --> 08:27.125
-Didn't I have Meijer at one-thirty?
-I can't reach him.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.208
How unlike him.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.833
Hello?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.792
Meijer?

09:36.167 --> 09:37.875
Wally here.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.042
Isaak?

10:04.042 --> 10:05.708
Hello?

11:23.292 --> 11:25.042
Mr van Hall?

11:26.708 --> 11:28.750
I'd like to have a word with you.

11:30.375 --> 11:34.083
-Excuse me, but who are you?
-Don't worry.

11:34.250 --> 11:38.750
If I had bad intentions, I wouldn't
have approached you this politely.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.667
I'm sorry, right now I can't...

11:50.875 --> 11:53.333
It won't be long before
this happens everywhere.

11:55.667 --> 12:00.833
Mr van Hall, don't you agree
it's time to fight back?

12:14.333 --> 12:17.333
-How long did you sail on the Flandria?
-A few years.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.708
Mostly South America. Brazil.

12:20.875 --> 12:24.833
-May I ask you why you gave it up?
-May I ask you who you are?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.375
Van den Berg.
Officer in the Royal Navy.

12:30.958 --> 12:36.000
These days I'm in the resistance.
Van den Berg isn't my real name.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.625
-My eyes.
-Sorry?

12:40.833 --> 12:45.125
That's why I quit.
Because of my eyes. Nearsighted.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.250
What do you want from me?

12:51.958 --> 12:54.000
What do you know
about the Seaman's Fund?

12:54.958 --> 12:57.250
An aid fund, right?

12:57.417 --> 12:59.583
For families of sailors who were
out at sea when the war started.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.375
Eighteen thousand men.
Hardly any of them have come back.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.750
They now sail for
our government in London.

13:06.917 --> 13:10.750
Initially the merchant marine
kept paying their wages.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.292
Until the Germans prohibited it.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.958
You're here for a donation to your fund.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.333
I'm here for much more than that,
Mr van Hall.

13:24.875 --> 13:29.542
My question to you is
if you'd be prepared to do the same

13:29.708 --> 13:31.042
for the Amsterdam region.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.875
Me? Why me?

13:34.042 --> 13:37.250
Your name, your reputation.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.750
And I was hoping you'd feel
a personal commitment.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.792
It's not without dangers, of course.

13:46.958 --> 13:50.958
I'd fully understand if you said no.
You have a family, after all.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.958
I don't want it.

14:06.292 --> 14:08.250
Of course I don't want it.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.458
But you must do it.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.125
An underground bank?
Have you lost your mind?

14:25.417 --> 14:28.333
-Did you hear about the Meijers?
-Yes.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.917
Tilly called Emmy. Terrible.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.583
Here, I found this at their home.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.125
All Jewish families in Zaandam
received this.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.917
"Instructions for the evacuation
from Zaandam.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.958
Lock your home and turn
the key over to the police.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.875
Only bring what you can carry."

14:47.042 --> 14:52.917
Here: "Terminate your rental contract.
Ten: Turn off gas, water and electricity."

14:53.625 --> 14:55.292
Does this sound as if they'll come back?

14:55.375 --> 14:57.625
Your Seaman's Fund
won't help these people.

15:01.208 --> 15:05.042
We have to do something.
With our connections.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.458
We can be just as well organised
as the Germans are.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.750
We'll borrow money
from befriended bankers.

15:15.917 --> 15:18.417
To be repaid by the government
after the war?

15:18.583 --> 15:21.917
-Exactly.
-You'd need an administration.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.500
Who will go along with that?

15:24.333 --> 15:26.625
Their names in the books
for the Germans to find?

15:28.042 --> 15:29.292
What's this?

15:31.625 --> 15:34.875
-This is worthless.
-From the Czarist era. Ideal.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.750
We're going to look for money.

15:38.917 --> 15:41.917
Everyone who loans
to the Seaman's Fund gets a share.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.167
Totally worthless.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.958
Each share represents 1000 guilders.

15:46.125 --> 15:50.208
We write down the serial number
and behind it 'x 50', for example.

15:50.375 --> 15:54.542
So after the war the shareholder
can show he contributed 50,000.

15:54.708 --> 15:57.625
All the Germans can find
is a worthless share.

15:57.792 --> 16:00.833
Or a meaningless row of numbers.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.833
-Smart plan.
-And zero risk.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.667
What's your objection?

16:09.833 --> 16:11.625
I'd bring Emmy
and the children in danger.

16:11.792 --> 16:13.708
-I have a family too.
-Maybe think about that.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.917
It's all I do.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.917
I'm sorry, but no.

16:20.083 --> 16:24.083
We're bankers, Wally.
We're no resistance fighters.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.458
Wally.

16:34.542 --> 16:38.792
I didn't see him for the next two months.
Very unusual for us.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.292
I knew he'd continue
with his plans without me.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.958
I tried not to worry.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.458
But I missed him.

17:17.125 --> 17:21.000
-Mr van Hall, working hard?
-It's my lunch hour.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.041
Yes, of course.
Just to warn you.

17:24.208 --> 17:28.041
Next week I'm taking all notes
of 500 and 1000 out of circulation.

17:28.208 --> 17:32.583
-Oh, why?
-To combat black market trading.

17:32.667 --> 17:36.333
There are always people
who try to profit in times of hardship.

17:36.500 --> 17:41.000
Large denominations can be traded in
at the treasury for two weeks.

17:41.167 --> 17:43.042
-Provided you can account for them.
-Of course.

17:43.208 --> 17:49.250
The telex won't go out till Monday, but we
bankers have to look out for each other.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.458
Well, I definitely appreciate that.

17:52.625 --> 17:56.917
Maybe you can do me
a favour in return.

17:57.792 --> 17:59.208
Should you hear of a party

17:59.375 --> 18:02.417
trying to get rid of a large amount
of 1000-guilder notes...

18:03.375 --> 18:04.917
I'll let you know right away.

18:05.708 --> 18:06.750
Good man.

18:32.125 --> 18:35.375
Mr van Hall, your brother
can't be disturbed right now.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.083
Mr van Hall.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.833
It's alright, Mrs van Veen.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.208
Jaap.
So he got you involved?

18:44.375 --> 18:47.708
What do you mean?
This is my new suit.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.500
So your plan is working.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.208
In the last three months
I've scraped up 500,000.

18:56.375 --> 18:59.208
-Five hundred thousand?
-Jaap is helping me distribute it.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.250
It's too much for me alone.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.583
Guys, you can forget it.

19:03.917 --> 19:07.792
Rost van Tonningen
has declared all 500 and 1000 notes void.

19:07.958 --> 19:09.667
-That can't be true.
-Why?

19:09.833 --> 19:13.083
-To combat black marketeering.
-And the resistance.

19:15.042 --> 19:16.792
How much do you have left?

19:23.958 --> 19:27.083
-Two hundred thousand.
-You have two weeks to trade it in.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.583
All I can think of is that you try and do
so through friends and acquaintances.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.542
I'll never manage on my own.

19:35.208 --> 19:39.042
-Oh no. I just come to warn you, Wally.
-The hard work has been done.

19:39.208 --> 19:42.250
The money is in.
And your network is much bigger.

19:42.417 --> 19:44.375
Otherwise this will all be worthless.

19:46.750 --> 19:51.000
De Vroedt will do it. Want to bet?
Beers. Van Manen.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.625
Elckenbout.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.958
I'm not sure about Beers.
I wouldn't ask him.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.333
-Henri ter Meulen?
-Henri, that's a good one.

20:00.958 --> 20:02.417
Couldn't this wait?

20:03.583 --> 20:07.250
-How many 1000s can you get rid of?
-Maybe twelve.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.708
-Forty.
-Eight, tops.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.125
Sorry, Gijs, none.
I have a safe full of them myself.

20:13.208 --> 20:16.958
I'm not afraid of the Krauts,
but of the treasury.

20:20.667 --> 20:24.208
And I have your word
it's for the Seaman's Fund?

20:25.583 --> 20:28.875
Then I won't ask any questions.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.708
Yes.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.208
-Will you do the bookkeeping?
-Me? Why me?

21:00.375 --> 21:02.875
-And we have to borrow more.
-More?

21:03.042 --> 21:06.500
Yes, we can trade in a lot more
than just our 200,000.

21:42.875 --> 21:47.667
Almost 600,000 more than two weeks ago.
All in small denominations.

21:49.875 --> 21:53.042
-I should thank Rost van Tonningen.
-Don't you dare.

21:53.208 --> 21:56.667
-This is just the start, Gijs.
-I was only going to help with this.

21:56.833 --> 22:00.125
But we can't stop now.
We're not doing enough yet.

22:00.292 --> 22:03.125
Who guarantees
that it will all be paid back?

22:03.542 --> 22:07.875
-Are you in contact with London?
-Later. Just enjoy what we're doing here.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.708
-Hey.
-Yes.

22:24.417 --> 22:28.042
The Seaman's Fund is just the start.
More and more people are in hiding.

22:28.208 --> 22:31.958
Jews afraid of deportation, men who
don't want to go to German factories.

22:32.125 --> 22:34.625
Political prisoners, prisoners of war.

22:34.792 --> 22:38.167
-They all leave families behind.
-Easy.

22:38.333 --> 22:42.833
The system works, Gijs. But we have
to think big. We need to scale up.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.250
-Will you stay involved?
-Just the administration.

22:48.542 --> 22:51.167
And someone has to keep an eye on him.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.750
Look, spies on the afterdeck.

23:04.833 --> 23:08.375
As the aid fund expands,
so does the danger, right?

23:08.542 --> 23:13.125
We're careful enough. Besides,
we're much smarter than the Germans.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.625
Yes, that's true.

23:57.375 --> 23:58.875
Herr Viebahn.

24:00.458 --> 24:05.167
-Can we have a brief word?
-At the SD headquarters, not here.

24:05.333 --> 24:08.500
But it's very important.
I need your help.

24:10.375 --> 24:13.708
We suspect there's an illegal bank,
here in Amsterdam.

24:13.875 --> 24:17.625
-What does the SD have to do with that?
-We need your methods.

24:20.750 --> 24:26.208
This here is my work.
Weapons, ammunition, bombs.

24:27.292 --> 24:30.167
I have no time to waste on swindlers.

24:30.333 --> 24:33.542
How do you think
all this gets financed?

24:33.708 --> 24:36.125
The Dutch State Bank limits itself
to paying salaries.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.542
So who financed these weapons?

24:39.708 --> 24:43.875
And the runaway Jews,
who pays for their food?

24:44.042 --> 24:47.875
And those who fled
from labour deployment?

24:48.042 --> 24:51.333
Who pays for their shelter?
Who pays for the illegal press?

24:51.500 --> 24:55.542
Civil donations?
A misconceived feeling of patriotism?

24:55.708 --> 24:59.708
At this volume?
Out of their own pockets?

24:59.875 --> 25:04.792
Herr Viebahn, in this country
only the sun rises for free.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.583
A shadow bank that finances
the resistance?

25:11.375 --> 25:12.792
Yes.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.542
Do you have evidence?

25:21.708 --> 25:25.583
That's what I need you for.
What if I'm right?

25:26.250 --> 25:29.375
Then you won't only decapitate
a resistance fighter

25:30.333 --> 25:32.125
but the entire organism.

25:40.250 --> 25:45.458
What and who exactly
are we looking for?

26:05.875 --> 26:08.500
Hoogte Kadijk.
Next to the garage.

26:31.292 --> 26:32.958
Ah, now we're complete.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.958
Sorry, Mr van Tuyl,
I thought I was being followed.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.375
Do you have the list?

26:41.792 --> 26:45.583
Alright, gentlemen, ladies.

26:47.083 --> 26:50.083
Everyone here is convinced
of the need to work together.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.625
So today:

26:52.833 --> 26:54.792
the system.

26:55.625 --> 26:58.417
Claim form accident
insurance, it says.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.083
But it really is a receipt
for aid received.

27:01.833 --> 27:06.625
There are nine categories of people
who qualify. Please memorize these.

27:07.542 --> 27:12.750
Once a month all claim forms
will be assembled by a district head.

27:12.917 --> 27:16.042
Another person will make the payments.
We'll work in cells.

27:16.625 --> 27:20.083
Everyone will only know the person...

27:20.250 --> 27:23.750
Hold on a second.
We never talked about administration.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.750
-We can't do without it.
-I beg to differ.

27:27.208 --> 27:31.708
How else will it be paid back?
We have to be able to account for it.

27:31.875 --> 27:36.542
What if the Germans find these records?
Then we'll all be arrested.

27:36.708 --> 27:38.292
Forget it, I say.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.500
Mr van den Berg.

27:44.125 --> 27:48.375
Adding this all up, I come to the
conclusion that due to overlapping

27:48.542 --> 27:52.542
some 90,000 ration cards are
distributed in excess every month.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.833
A waste of money
and an unnecessary risk.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.833
This system works.
It's safe and it's necessary.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.292
We'll finally have a professionally-run
defense set up against the occupiers.

28:04.542 --> 28:08.042
Organised and structured,
just as they would do it.

28:11.375 --> 28:14.792
Sorry, I don't know
if I feel like it this way.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.542
Feel like it?

28:17.500 --> 28:21.000
We're not doing this for fun, are we?
It's our duty.

28:24.292 --> 28:29.375
There's a lot of money to be distributed.
You don't have to accept it, of course.

28:29.833 --> 28:33.708
However, if you do, it will be
done my way and none other.

28:53.708 --> 28:59.000
It's too much. I need a second safe,
just for the administration of the fund.

28:59.167 --> 29:03.167
-Terrific, isn't it? It works.
-Yes, much too well.

29:04.333 --> 29:07.125
What if the government won't pay back?

29:08.500 --> 29:11.417
Ever seen a button worth thirty million?

29:14.292 --> 29:20.667
The Dutch government hereby guarantees
the reimbursement of...

29:41.708 --> 29:48.792
"The Dutch government hereby guarantees
the reimbursement of a maximum sum of..."

29:48.958 --> 29:50.583
Thirty million.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.542
Alright. Good, then that's our limit.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.375
No, there is no limit.

29:55.542 --> 29:56.958
Don't you see what this letter means?

29:57.417 --> 30:00.917
London sees us as the official bank of the
resistance. So we can go much farther.

30:01.083 --> 30:04.042
You think we can just withdraw this
at the Dutch State Bank?

30:04.208 --> 30:07.125
-Thirty million?
-Shall we give it a shot?

30:07.292 --> 30:10.667
-What happens with all that money anyway?
-Come.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.542
Where are we going?

30:19.083 --> 30:21.458
What are we waiting for?

30:21.625 --> 30:23.458
For the fireworks.

30:23.625 --> 30:29.458
Come, let's watch from over here.
Look carefully, on the other side.

30:42.917 --> 30:43.917
What is this?

30:44.083 --> 30:45.833
The population register
of the Zaanstreek.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.875
Wim's papers?

30:50.083 --> 30:51.083
Who's Wim?

30:51.250 --> 30:55.333
Her boyfriend. He had to report
for labour deployment.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.042
But not anymore.

30:59.333 --> 31:02.167
Tilly, if the Germans
trace this back to us...

31:02.250 --> 31:04.125
You don't think I can stop him, do you?

31:28.125 --> 31:30.958
-Platform six?
-To the right.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.375
Thank you.

31:53.042 --> 31:55.750
Gentlemen. Huub.

31:56.333 --> 32:00.875
-Van Tuyl himself, that's an honour.
-Scared you, didn't I?

32:01.667 --> 32:04.125
Stay right there.

32:52.792 --> 32:56.000
Where does the money come from?

32:59.125 --> 33:00.583
Say it!

33:03.000 --> 33:05.167
We need a new district head
for Amersfoort.

33:05.333 --> 33:08.333
Van Poppen has Germans
quartered with him.

33:08.500 --> 33:12.042
-Who?
-Never mind.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.542
We only need a name.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.417
Den Helder thanks you, Mr van Tuyl.

33:33.792 --> 33:35.542
Van Tuyl.

33:37.708 --> 33:39.417
Van Tuyl.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.750
It won't be long anymore, darling.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.667
-It won't be long...
-Yes.

35:49.333 --> 35:50.917
-Be careful.
-I will.

35:57.625 --> 36:01.667
Mr van Hall.
I haven't seen you in ages.

36:01.833 --> 36:05.833
-Not much to do at the exchange lately.
-I know all about it.

36:06.250 --> 36:10.708
Now that I see you, does the name
'van Tuyl' mean anything to you?

36:16.750 --> 36:18.167
No, sorry.

36:18.333 --> 36:22.042
Keeps coming up in an investigation
into financial crimes.

36:22.208 --> 36:23.750
-Will you keep me posted?
-Of course.

36:24.167 --> 36:25.875
Good man.

36:45.375 --> 36:47.708
Stop. Stay there.

36:54.125 --> 36:56.833
-What have you got there?
-Nothing...

37:01.292 --> 37:02.583
Look.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.167
DUTCH NEWS

37:09.750 --> 37:14.292
<i>At the invasion front. The German</i>
<i>defense is taking on the enemy</i>

37:14.458 --> 37:17.458
<i>in fierce man-to-man combat.</i>

37:17.625 --> 37:20.542
<i>Also a large number of</i>
<i>British planes are taken down.</i>

37:20.708 --> 37:22.917
That you can sleep with that noise.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.708
<i>Air-raid alarm.</i>

37:28.375 --> 37:32.208
<i>Within no time the guns are camouflaged</i>
<i>and the men take cover.</i>

37:32.375 --> 37:35.375
Sorry, had a rather short night.

37:35.542 --> 37:39.167
Why don't you go to bed?
I'll do this one.

37:39.250 --> 37:44.458
-No, I can manage.
-No, I'll deliver the money. It's not far.

37:45.833 --> 37:49.125
I've seen this one already anyway.
Lousy story. Too many bad guys.

37:49.292 --> 37:55.000
<i>The British and American advance is not</i>
<i>only being deterred by German soldiers</i>

37:55.208 --> 37:58.750
<i>but also by the systematic demolition</i>
<i>of strategic buildings.</i>

38:09.292 --> 38:13.208
This came from London this morning.
It's just been deciphered.

38:21.417 --> 38:22.833
What?

38:25.875 --> 38:28.667
"Versteeg's children can go to bed."

38:28.833 --> 38:30.667
Versteeg is code for the Dutch Railways.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.875
A railway strike?

38:33.042 --> 38:35.250
Will the trains stop running?

38:35.417 --> 38:37.458
That's fantastic.

38:37.833 --> 38:40.000
What? That means it's almost over.

38:40.167 --> 38:43.583
The Krauts are helpless
without the railroad.

38:44.667 --> 38:47.875
Direct orders from London.
The strikers have to get paid.

38:48.042 --> 38:51.208
What? By us?
How many of them are there?

38:51.500 --> 38:54.500
The longer the trains are down,
the harder for the Germans.

38:54.667 --> 38:57.708
Perhaps...
Perhaps this is the final blow.

39:00.125 --> 39:03.125
-Where are you going?
-To the Dutch Railways.

39:15.458 --> 39:18.625
-We're prepared.
-So you will pay the strikers?

39:18.875 --> 39:23.417
We set up invasion cash funds
at various stations, just in case.

39:23.583 --> 39:28.583
-How long will they suffice?
-Long enough to see us through the war.

39:29.375 --> 39:33.375
-How long?
-Three weeks to a month and it'll be over.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.083
And then we can go back to work again.

39:37.292 --> 39:42.875
So I'm not convinced of the necessity
to work together with you, Mr van Tuyl.

39:43.125 --> 39:46.125
What if the war isn't over
in three weeks?

39:47.708 --> 39:50.875
We think it's better to find
a more structural solution.

39:51.042 --> 39:55.375
Well, if you have such deep pockets...

39:55.542 --> 39:58.917
-We're talking about over 30,000 people.
-We know that.

40:00.333 --> 40:03.250
If you give us the money,
we'll see to the distribution.

40:03.417 --> 40:05.083
-We don't work like that.
-Sorry?

40:05.250 --> 40:09.792
You give us the data of your staff,
we do the distribution and administration.

40:09.958 --> 40:12.833
Out of the question.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.125
Do you really think I'd just pass on
all the data of my employees

40:18.292 --> 40:22.125
to a bunch of adventurers?

40:24.042 --> 40:26.333
-Adventurers?
-Mr van Tuyl...

40:26.750 --> 40:30.292
I happen to run the largest
company of the country.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.750
-I can't just...
-I know exactly what you're trying to do.

40:32.833 --> 40:36.292
Ingratiate yourself
with our government in London.

40:36.583 --> 40:41.083
-You should have acted two years ago.
-Without government orders?

40:41.250 --> 40:46.958
Striking is a capital crime, Mr van Tuyl.
My people are risking everything.

40:47.125 --> 40:49.875
Now they are.
All war long you served the Germans.

40:50.042 --> 40:52.458
-And our people.
-You brought the Jews to the camps.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.917
-And food to the cities.
-You've made millions.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.417
-It's my company.
-It's my money.

40:57.583 --> 41:01.250
Maybe it's best to first discuss
the sums involved.

41:03.250 --> 41:06.542
-I don't follow.
-A maximum of 10 per cent of the wages.

41:07.042 --> 41:08.917
That's absolutely unacceptable.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.042
-And?
-All strikers 100 per cent.

41:19.208 --> 41:22.667
-33,000 people. That man is insane.
-But that's...

41:22.833 --> 41:25.458
Five or six million a month, extra.

41:25.625 --> 41:28.750
-That's more than we've spent so far.
-I know.

41:30.292 --> 41:32.167
Can we refuse?

41:32.750 --> 41:35.417
Radio Orange already announced the strike.

41:35.583 --> 41:38.292
Engineers have quit work
and must get paid.

41:38.375 --> 41:42.125
We don't have the money.
Rost van Tonningen is sitting on it.

41:42.292 --> 41:45.375
Or you have to rob the Dutch State Bank.

41:48.208 --> 41:50.625
That was a joke, Wally.

41:50.792 --> 41:53.500
We can't rob the Dutch State Bank.
We're no bank robbers.

41:53.792 --> 41:56.667
-We have no other choice.
-Yes, we do, namely not do it.

41:56.750 --> 42:00.375
-Do you have a better idea?
-That money is locked away.

42:00.542 --> 42:03.167
They only use it for salaries.

42:04.250 --> 42:05.750
And treasury bonds.

42:08.750 --> 42:13.292
-We can trade treasury bonds for money.
-And how will we get those?

42:13.625 --> 42:16.000
-Forge them?
-It will solve all our problems.

42:16.417 --> 42:18.625
We won't trade in forged treasury bonds.

42:18.792 --> 42:20.875
That's bank fraud.
Totally immoral.

42:21.542 --> 42:25.958
And it always comes out.
No, Wally, absolutely not.

42:29.917 --> 42:34.542
What's the similarity between
Rost van Tonningen and the Dutch flag?

42:35.500 --> 42:37.125
-Well?
-They'll both...

42:37.292 --> 42:40.708
What if we forge them
and switch them with the real ones?

42:40.875 --> 42:42.833
No one will ever find out.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.375
-Impossible.
-What's this about?

42:44.542 --> 42:46.750
If we trade in real bonds,
it won't be fraud.

42:46.917 --> 42:50.417
Of course it is. Besides,
the design is forgery-proof.

42:50.583 --> 42:51.667
Nothing is.

42:51.833 --> 42:54.792
You'd need access to the Bank itself.
Just forget it.

42:54.958 --> 42:56.958
What is a treasury bond?

43:04.458 --> 43:07.250
-Securities.
-But then from the state.

43:07.417 --> 43:09.458
A bit like the chips of a casino.

43:10.375 --> 43:12.208
And you want to forge them?

43:14.458 --> 43:17.250
Wally wants to steal the chips
from the casino's safe

43:17.417 --> 43:19.833
and exchange them for cash
at the same casino.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.125
-Clever.
-And impossible.

43:22.292 --> 43:25.292
You'd need someone inside the casino.

43:39.917 --> 43:41.750
If it's a no, it's a no.

43:42.458 --> 43:44.458
They already have two sons of his.

43:44.625 --> 43:45.667
Exactly.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.083
If Ritter gets caught,
will you tell his wife?

43:50.917 --> 43:52.292
No, I'll do it.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.125
-We'd understand if you refused.
-But without you it's impossible.

44:04.292 --> 44:10.833
Guys, what on earth are you asking me?
We're all terrified of Rost van Tonningen.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.167
If he catches me doing this...

44:19.250 --> 44:21.250
Any news yet?

44:22.792 --> 44:24.167
No.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.708
It's taking too long.

44:32.208 --> 44:34.750
The Germans are...

44:34.917 --> 44:36.875
Especially with pilots.

44:38.083 --> 44:41.250
So we pray. And pray.

44:41.417 --> 44:43.750
-And does that help?
-Wally...

44:43.917 --> 44:47.042
This is a way to do something.
Something to hit the Germans hard.

44:47.208 --> 44:48.667
Just like your sons did.

44:48.833 --> 44:51.792
I'm not brave like them.

44:52.958 --> 44:56.042
I... I can't do it.

44:56.208 --> 44:58.000
I understand.

44:59.458 --> 45:02.833
Besides, a forgery like that,
they'd notice at once.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.958
-Does the bank still have electricity?
-Not in the basement.

45:07.417 --> 45:09.125
Just candlelight.

45:14.250 --> 45:17.167
-Really, I'm sorry.
-If we make sure...

45:17.417 --> 45:19.375
We're sorry as well.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.792
Thank you.

45:44.250 --> 45:47.333
Putting a scared old man under pressure.
Proud of yourself?

45:47.500 --> 45:49.833
It's war, and we need Ritter.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.417
-So everything is permitted?
-Gijs, stop it.

45:52.583 --> 45:55.042
-Father should have seen you.
-He'd have done the same thing.

45:55.208 --> 45:58.542
Don't tell me I have to stop now.
Don't.

46:00.208 --> 46:02.125
-Wally...
-Walraven.

46:03.125 --> 46:05.083
Even if I agreed to do it

46:05.250 --> 46:09.042
you'd first need a bank to order
needless treasury bonds

46:09.625 --> 46:13.167
and someone at the Ministry of Finance
to give you the numbers.

46:13.625 --> 46:16.458
And then you'd still have to forge them.

46:19.417 --> 46:21.042
But if all that works out?

46:32.000 --> 46:35.875
So you want me to order millions
worth of treasury bonds

46:36.042 --> 46:39.333
from the Ministry of Finance
without any questions?

46:39.500 --> 46:40.875
-Yes.
-I told Wally...

46:41.042 --> 46:43.083
No, that's fine. I'll do it.

46:46.250 --> 46:49.000
What mischief are you two up to?

46:51.375 --> 46:57.125
Suppose the Post Office Savings Bank
ordered treasury bonds at your agency.

46:57.292 --> 47:02.208
-Could you give us the serial numbers?
-And the dates of issue?

47:10.208 --> 47:12.708
-Ask someone else, please.
-Come on, Dubois.

47:12.875 --> 47:16.500
I'm really not into such schemes.
Nor are you, are you, Gijs?

47:17.667 --> 47:19.458
Be honest.

47:20.458 --> 47:25.375
And what will I say after the war
when people ask why Wally's plan failed?

47:25.625 --> 47:27.583
No time, no interest?

47:27.750 --> 47:30.583
-Say? To whom?
-To our government.

47:30.917 --> 47:34.250
We have carte blanche for 30 million,
only we have no access to it.

47:34.417 --> 47:37.458
We have no one else.
You're the only one we trust.

47:45.167 --> 47:49.167
Have you seen the Vondelpark?
They've stationed tanks there,

47:49.750 --> 47:54.083
felled trees, dug ditches and trenches,
set up machine gun nests.

47:55.333 --> 47:58.292
I used to go for a walk there
every morning.

48:10.083 --> 48:13.958
The Post Office Savings Bank
you said, right?

48:29.500 --> 48:33.875
Yes, you're keeping her here.
I'm her lawyer and I want to see her now.

48:34.042 --> 48:38.750
Jeanette Veenstra, with a 'V'.
Otherwise I want to talk to your superior.

48:44.042 --> 48:45.708
Herr van Berkel?

48:46.750 --> 48:50.875
Jeanette Veenstra. You're detaining her.
I want to buy her off.

48:51.042 --> 48:56.333
She didn't know about the papers.
Besides, it's just a newspaper, isn't it?

48:56.542 --> 49:00.417
No valid ground
to lock her up without trial.

49:00.500 --> 49:02.625
Doesn't it violate
Germany's honour code?

49:02.792 --> 49:05.792
We already expected you.
Your wife was here yesterday.

49:09.458 --> 49:12.542
Isn't Jeanette your girlfriend
since childhood?

49:12.708 --> 49:15.000
She's a friend of the family.

49:15.167 --> 49:17.542
A pretty girl, don't you agree?

49:18.042 --> 49:19.375
I suppose.

49:21.833 --> 49:22.708
Please.

49:24.417 --> 49:26.083
Have a seat.

49:32.667 --> 49:36.083
Why would a pretty girl like that
distribute such trash?

49:36.250 --> 49:40.042
-I have no idea.
-I do. Because of you.

49:41.292 --> 49:44.792
Your firm has close ties
to the Parool newspaper, doesn't it?

49:48.042 --> 49:52.375
You're surprised. This is just
the start, we know a lot more.

49:53.583 --> 49:55.208
We have two options now.

49:55.292 --> 50:01.167
Either I arrest you
or you answer one simple question.

50:04.625 --> 50:06.750
What do you have to offer me?

50:11.458 --> 50:14.750
This is what we're going to forge.
And it won't be easy.

50:15.458 --> 50:19.542
As you see, the paper contains tiny
threads. Blue, green, purple, red.

50:20.083 --> 50:22.542
This type of paper is unavailable.

50:22.708 --> 50:27.333
But our friends at the ID Card Centre
have helped find a way to counterfeit it.

50:27.667 --> 50:31.000
However, we do need
those four colours of ink.

50:31.167 --> 50:35.208
The sheets must be the exact same size.
Huub, can you see to that?

50:35.375 --> 50:37.167
Some options for printers.

50:37.333 --> 50:42.875
I think Mouton & Co is most convenient,
because of the logistics.

50:45.458 --> 50:47.500
-Yes? Excellent.
-And the text?

50:47.667 --> 50:50.833
The text will be handwork.
The stamp as well.

50:51.583 --> 50:55.792
It goes without saying it must be
done fast. The till is almost empty.

50:55.958 --> 50:57.875
And I mean that literally.

50:58.042 --> 50:59.625
-And the ink?
-I'll procure the ink.

50:59.792 --> 51:02.667
I'm seeing someone
about that tomorrow.

51:03.083 --> 51:05.417
He also works for Het Parool.
Alright?

51:56.292 --> 51:59.917
Well, sir, you're in luck.

52:01.083 --> 52:03.958
Usually it's packed at this hour.

52:05.083 --> 52:07.750
I don't know what's going on today.

52:17.125 --> 52:20.625
Must have to do with the weather.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.417
Thank you.

53:56.250 --> 53:58.125
Excellent job.

54:42.208 --> 54:44.667
Were they there for van Tuyl?

54:45.458 --> 54:47.792
That's hard to say.

54:50.917 --> 54:52.583
Possibly.

54:57.542 --> 54:59.458
So you're leaving?

55:02.250 --> 55:03.708
Yes.

55:04.917 --> 55:07.125
I think it's safest.

55:18.167 --> 55:21.458
-Why?
-Because I'm very busy.

55:21.708 --> 55:24.625
So busy I can't come back
to Zaandam all the time.

55:24.792 --> 55:27.708
And it's better if I stay at work.

55:27.875 --> 55:30.250
At the large bank?

55:30.417 --> 55:32.917
No, other work.

55:34.375 --> 55:38.792
-When will you be back?
-I'm not sure.

55:39.542 --> 55:44.375
But one day it'll be over
and we'll climb the highest trees again.

55:44.542 --> 55:47.000
You guys first. Alright?

55:59.667 --> 56:01.750
Be good to Mommy, alright?

56:22.375 --> 56:26.000
-Do I know where you are?
-No, better if you don't.

56:26.167 --> 56:28.667
I'll call you as often as I can.

56:35.625 --> 56:39.500
-Will you manage without me?
-Stop it.

57:36.583 --> 57:38.375
We were there, he didn't come.

57:38.542 --> 57:42.125
-My information was correct.
-Bollocks. I'll go see your wife.

57:42.292 --> 57:45.042
-My wife?
-I know you and Jeanette are involved.

57:45.208 --> 57:49.542
-That's not true. She won't believe you.
-My experience tells me differently.

57:49.708 --> 57:51.958
And Jeanette, when will she get out?

57:53.208 --> 57:54.833
Let her go.

57:59.125 --> 58:01.375
OelschlÃ¤gel, what's the matter?

58:12.625 --> 58:15.708
Does the name van Tuyl
mean anything to you?

58:17.458 --> 58:18.667
No.

58:20.625 --> 58:24.000
Too bad. We could have
meant a lot for each other.

58:25.375 --> 58:27.083
What does this person do?

58:28.292 --> 58:30.292
This person finances the resistance.

58:32.958 --> 58:36.667
Let Jeanette go and I'll find him.

58:43.125 --> 58:47.333
I can't do so without her.
She has the connections, I don't.

58:56.167 --> 58:59.958
In that case, good hunting.

59:18.042 --> 59:22.250
Oh, sweetheart.
What have they done?

59:56.583 --> 59:59.583
-First-rate work.
-This is the first step.

59:59.750 --> 01:00:02.792
The hard part is that we
have three printings...

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:07.792
-Were you followed?
-Impossible.

01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:10.417
-Do you have a gun?
-No.

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:26.208
Van Tuyl.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.708
Jaap? What are you doing here?

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:34.167
We're in trouble.
Van den Berg.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:50.958
-Have we been betrayed?
-It could be a coincidence.

01:00:52.708 --> 01:00:56.250
-Will he talk?
-Van den Berg? No, out of the question.

01:00:56.417 --> 01:00:58.750
-He knows your name.
-Van den Berg won't talk.

01:00:58.917 --> 01:01:01.708
-Maybe we should stop.
-We won't stop.

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:03.833
We have the paper, we're going on.

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:09.875
It's the last thing I'll make for you.
Sorry.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.417
I don't want the Krauts at my door.

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:19.958
-Can't we buy him free?
-No way.

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:25.000
-Then they'll realise how valuable he is.
-We can't just let him rot.

01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:31.667
We have the paper.
Jaap has found a new printer.

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:34.667
Huub the ink.
We'll stick to the plan.

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.917
I pray for you.

01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:01.458
If you wish, I can warn people.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.917
Is there anyone? An address?

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:32.875
Hey Huub, what's the similarity between
Rost van Tonningen and the Dutch flag?

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:36.875
Don't forget that van den Berg
is in a cell right now.

01:02:37.042 --> 01:02:40.208
We're still free
because he keeps his mouth shut.

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:42.542
Don't think they make it easy for him.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.833
No.

01:04:11.167 --> 01:04:12.792
Van den Berg?

01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:20.042
Then it's clear. We're stopping.

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:24.083
We can't stop.
Too many people depend on us.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:27.875
On us or on you?
What are you trying to prove?

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:34.833
I'm quitting.
I have my family to think of.

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:37.875
And if you're smart...

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:57.125
This is your last delivery for now.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:00.500
Try to pick up some food
in the countryside.

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:03.208
-Isn't there something else I can do?
-Something else?

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:07.625
If I no longer have to make deliveries,
I can help some other way.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:15.667
They need a different location
for their meetings every month.

01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:18.708
Never twice in the same place.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.917
-What kind of group is it?
-I don't know exactly.

01:06:23.167 --> 01:06:25.833
But they're very big.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:29.542
And I get to arrange
a place for them to meet.

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:36.083
They can use my office.

01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:40.167
-It's safe there.
-Really?

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:53.082
Everyone outside, in the van.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:58.792
-Come on, take them away.
-Move it.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:02.750
Him as well. Go on, hurry up.

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:07.542
-You, take off.
-Let's go.

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:29.875
-This has to go to Wally, not to me.
-If I knew where he was, I'd be there now.

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:36.417
I'll make sure he gets it.

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:41.832
Well, you're welcome.
Anything else I can get you?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.542
A nice juicy steak, perhaps?
Just let me know.

01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:46.832
Yes, thank you.

01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:12.542
A present.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.708
The serial numbers.

01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:30.833
A meeting was betrayed yesterday.
Huub barely escaped.

01:10:31.083 --> 01:10:34.250
-But they have Jaap.
-Jaap?

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.542
He won't talk. Right?

01:10:42.958 --> 01:10:48.292
Rost van Tonningen will be in The Hague
all day tomorrow. So we'll do it tomorrow.

01:10:48.542 --> 01:10:50.625
It has to be tomorrow.

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:07.625
That can't be true.

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:12.208
He was supposed to be in The Hague.
All day.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:20.583
-It can still work out, right?
-If Ritter sees him while we promised...

01:12:22.792 --> 01:12:27.208
-I have to stop him.
-No, you have no business there.

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:29.208
-And you're worn-out.
-What else can we do?

01:12:55.708 --> 01:12:57.500
They know me there.

01:12:58.333 --> 01:12:59.917
Gijs.

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.458
Meinoud.

01:13:57.042 --> 01:14:00.583
Mr van Hall, what can I do for you?

01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:04.542
I...

01:14:04.792 --> 01:14:09.000
hear you're looking
for a certain van Tuyl.

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:14.833
-I think I have information.
-What do you know?

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:20.000
Mr Ritter.

01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:23.833
Can I help you?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.250
I come for the treasury bonds.
From the Post Office Savings Bank.

01:15:27.417 --> 01:15:29.500
They're here in the safe.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:32.708
-What about those bonds?
-I have to take them.

01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:34.292
At whose orders?

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:40.875
-Van Tuyl?
-Yes.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:44.458
Yes, van Tuyl.

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:50.875
It's an alias, of course.
But I hear it more and more often.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.125
Bankers talk a lot among one another.

01:15:58.458 --> 01:15:59.917
And?

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:03.917
And my suspicion is
that van Tuyl is responsible

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:07.500
for the financing of a large part
of the Dutch resistance.

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:14.417
-The treasury bonds never leave the depot.
-It's an order from the...

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.458
from some German official or other.

01:16:16.542 --> 01:16:19.708
-Who?
-His name?

01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:23.083
It escapes me right now.

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:29.875
He wants to check the reserved bonds,
because he thinks they've been forged.

01:16:30.417 --> 01:16:32.875
Impossible.
The bonds can't be forged.

01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:34.208
Yes...

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:43.500
I'd better take them anyway,
so he can check them himself.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:46.250
How many are we talking about?

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.000
-This is very unusual.
-Only the Krauts, right?

01:16:57.375 --> 01:17:00.083
-What are you doing?
-Call, for confirmation.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:05.500
-Let me remind you that I'm your boss.
-Rost van Tonningen is my boss.

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:09.000
Yes, Bakker speaking.
Is he there?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.750
Yes, this is urgent.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:25.000
So those striking engineers
are still getting paid.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.000
And that's once again van Tuyl.

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.167
But what I need is his real name.

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:34.583
Yes, that I don't know.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:38.542
But I may know
another name he uses.

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:52.458
-'The oilman'? I already know it.
-The oilman? No, not the oilman.

01:17:52.708 --> 01:17:55.125
No, van den Berg.

01:18:06.583 --> 01:18:09.375
We'd better put this off for now.

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:28.333
Get those bonds for me right now.
And do so with a smile on your face.

01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:33.667
Then you'll write down the numbers
without complaining and give me a receipt.

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:36.917
And when you're done, you'll thank me.

01:18:37.167 --> 01:18:39.833
-Ask me what for.
-What for?

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.500
Because I didn't go upstairs
to complain to Rost van Tonningen.

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:46.917
If he hears that someone down here
is doing all he can

01:18:47.167 --> 01:18:50.958
to make things difficult for the Germans,
you have a big problem.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.917
He may think you work
for the resistance.

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:57.625
-Do you work for the resistance?
-No, sir.

01:18:57.875 --> 01:19:01.542
Then hop to it.
I have other things to do.

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:43.375
That's impossible.
If van den Berg was van Tuyl

01:19:43.458 --> 01:19:48.375
the resistance would long have
collapsed, but it's stronger than ever.

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:50.833
Yes, perhaps.

01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:54.417
You probably know better.
Your connections are better than mine.

01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:58.167
Alright. If that's all,
I thank you for the information.

01:19:58.417 --> 01:19:59.500
Yes.

01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:06.000
You're a busy man, of course.

01:20:25.583 --> 01:20:27.583
-Will you find your way out?
-Yes.

01:20:27.833 --> 01:20:29.667
Goodbye.

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:33.792
What's the matter, Ritter?

01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:36.625
Well?

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:44.167
-Oh, is that my briefcase?
-Yes, I saw it...

01:20:49.458 --> 01:20:51.125
May I have a look?

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:56.125
But that's a real Swaine & Adeney.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:01.875
British. Not allowed, is it?

01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:06.958
It's a family heirloom.

01:21:08.625 --> 01:21:10.125
Yes.

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:13.625
Ritter.

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:32.542
-Keep walking.
-Do you have them?

01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:36.458
Please let the Allies make haste.
I won't do this again.

01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:55.125
I have a million worth
of treasury bonds here.

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:57.417
Can you have it ready
at the desk?

01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:01.500
-There's our money.
-Well-protected.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.125
Yes, imagine it got stolen.

01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:52.333
This is a very nice bottle.

01:22:52.917 --> 01:22:57.458
Exactly the right temperature.
Close to freezing point.

01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:02.792
They have to look used.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.292
-Cheers.
-Cork.

01:23:11.125 --> 01:23:13.625
I'm considering a...

01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:15.167
career switch.

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:16.750
Me too.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.083
-After the war.
-Seriously?

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:23.208
-I'm not a banker.
-True.

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:26.500
-You're a bank robber.
-So are you.

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:29.792
To us, the greatest bank robbers
of all time.

01:23:30.375 --> 01:23:32.375
No, this one's to Rost van Tonningen.

01:23:32.625 --> 01:23:37.667
To Meinoud. Here you go.
Pay more attention in the future.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:48.583
How long do you think this will last us?
A month?

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.458
So little?

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:54.167
Even the Red Cross
is asking for money. For fuel.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:57.958
Maybe we should use Red Cross vehicles
to bring money to the north.

01:23:58.125 --> 01:24:00.125
Hey, give it a break.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.125
Can't we just enjoy this a little?

01:24:03.292 --> 01:24:05.583
Haven't we done enough yet?

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.667
Wally...

01:24:13.542 --> 01:24:16.458
I don't want anything to happen to you.

01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:19.125
You're my brother.

01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:24.958
You're my little brother, dammit.

01:24:25.792 --> 01:24:27.167
Hey.

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:30.917
We're bank robbers.

01:24:31.083 --> 01:24:34.000
Yes, so what?
They have feelings too.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:36.083
It's almost over.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.917
Just a few final convulsions.

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:41.833
We'll make it.

01:24:48.042 --> 01:24:49.333
Maybe...

01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:52.167
Maybe it will even be enough.

01:24:53.792 --> 01:24:56.167
How much do you think it is?

01:24:58.542 --> 01:25:01.542
Sorry?
Could you repeat that figure?

01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:04.875
Of course.
Fifty-one million guilders.

01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:09.042
But that's only from the safe.
In total...

01:25:09.292 --> 01:25:13.708
with all the loans added up,
it's almost one hundred million.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:21.333
You had a government guarantee
of thirty million. Thirty, not hundred.

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:24.458
-If we'd had to wait for you...
-You understand that we can't...

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:30.417
-For such a claim other procedures...
-You have no idea, do you?

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:34.833
You were safely in London, drinking tea.
You have no idea.

01:25:35.083 --> 01:25:37.417
We paid for everything.
Everything.

01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:40.958
The resistance, the assault groups,
the railway strikers,

01:25:41.208 --> 01:25:45.375
the illegal press, the illegal printers,
the ID Card Centre,

01:25:45.625 --> 01:25:49.458
spy groups, sabotage groups,
everything.

01:25:50.042 --> 01:25:52.708
And then I haven't mentioned
the danger we faced...

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:59.375
And the hunger, and the cold.

01:27:15.042 --> 01:27:17.583
-That much money?
-Yes.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.917
If they find out...

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:22.792
That won't happen.

01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:25.250
Really.

01:27:27.583 --> 01:27:31.250
-Is it safe for you to be here?
-Just briefly.

01:27:33.792 --> 01:27:36.000
I had to see you.

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:42.875
And we?

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:47.500
Are we safe?

01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:51.750
You? Are you safe?

01:27:57.833 --> 01:28:00.375
You want me to stop.

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:05.542
Yes, I do.
Of course I do.

01:28:06.417 --> 01:28:08.542
But you shouldn't.

01:29:04.833 --> 01:29:08.292
No casualties.
Viebahn promised.

01:29:08.833 --> 01:29:11.042
You promised us van Tuyl.
Where is he?

01:29:11.292 --> 01:29:14.542
-I first want a written guarantee.
-Who's there?

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:35.792
Let's get out.

01:30:13.042 --> 01:30:17.750
-Are we going to climb trees tomorrow?
-No, sweetheart, we can't. It's snowing.

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:24.542
-Will you make a snowman with me then?
-Perhaps.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.250
First get some sleep, alright?

01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:31.167
Little pirate.

01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:34.875
Sleep tight.

01:30:35.917 --> 01:30:37.792
My little man.

01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:25.583
What will we do
once we've been liberated?

01:31:27.667 --> 01:31:31.667
-First you'll rest for a long time.
-And then?

01:31:32.625 --> 01:31:34.292
Then I'll rest.

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:39.708
And then we'll go sailing.

01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:43.708
Roam the seas for months, far away.

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:49.083
Let me guess. South America?

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:55.875
Then we'll sail back home again.
And then...

01:31:56.125 --> 01:32:00.333
And then bacon and eggs every day.

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:03.125
Real coffee.

01:32:07.417 --> 01:32:10.625
-You know what my mother told me?
-What?

01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:16.667
That they call van Tuyl
'the premier of the resistance'.

01:32:19.583 --> 01:32:23.917
The world will lie at your feet,
but you have to remain careful.

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:28.500
-See that you make it.
-I am careful.

01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:31.208
I'll make it.

01:32:35.833 --> 01:32:40.417
And you know what?
I'll become premier of the Netherlands.

01:32:48.167 --> 01:32:51.167
I'm going to have
these thirty people shot.

01:32:51.333 --> 01:32:52.917
Today.

01:32:53.875 --> 01:32:56.500
You'll have them on your conscience.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.125
What did you expect?

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:14.292
And when we're done with you,
you'll wish you were one of those thirty.

01:33:27.792 --> 01:33:30.208
You have an appointment today.

01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:34.042
A meeting?

01:33:37.833 --> 01:33:39.333
Where?

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.708
With whom?

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.667
Why don't you just cooperate with us?

01:33:59.625 --> 01:34:01.375
In the end they all talk.

01:34:21.625 --> 01:34:23.750
Let's go.

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:46.458
-Was Daddy here last night?
-Briefly, but he had to leave again.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.833
Daddy.

01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:24.000
Daddy.

01:36:59.833 --> 01:37:01.500
Daddy.

01:37:11.958 --> 01:37:14.750
Van Hall.

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.250
Van Hall.

01:37:40.083 --> 01:37:41.250
And now?

01:37:42.625 --> 01:37:44.250
We'll wait.

01:37:45.792 --> 01:37:47.333
For van Tuyl.

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.417
Yes, sir.

01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:27.792
Hello?

01:38:38.292 --> 01:38:40.333
-Jaap.
-Wally.

01:38:40.917 --> 01:38:42.792
-You too?
-Someone talked.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.958
-Do you know who?
-No idea.

01:38:47.625 --> 01:38:49.958
-Huub's here as well.
-What?

01:38:50.083 --> 01:38:55.667
-I saw him in the corridor.
-Huub? He'd gone into hiding.

01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:59.583
They'd beaten the shit out of him.
He could hardly walk.

01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:03.833
They wouldn't have done so
if he'd cooperated, right?

01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:09.792
Wally, do the Germans know
who you really are?

01:39:09.917 --> 01:39:11.167
Not yet.

01:39:11.792 --> 01:39:14.583
That's good. That's good.

01:39:19.125 --> 01:39:21.958
-And the money?
-Safe.

01:39:23.417 --> 01:39:25.083
Then we can buy him off.

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:31.167
There's enough money.

01:39:35.708 --> 01:39:37.875
Then we'll draw attention to him.

01:39:39.958 --> 01:39:43.083
They'll think: who is this van Hall
that he's worth so much?

01:39:43.167 --> 01:39:46.917
Right now they don't know
they have van Tuyl.

01:39:47.417 --> 01:39:49.583
So we won't do anything?

01:39:50.167 --> 01:39:52.333
It can't be long anymore.

01:39:52.583 --> 01:39:56.083
A few weeks, a few days.
The Allies are halfway across the country.

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:58.375
We can't just wait, can we?

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:06.875
I'm going on with the bank.
Just as Wally would do.

01:40:09.875 --> 01:40:11.500
Does Emmy know?

01:40:12.958 --> 01:40:17.292
We have to go into hiding,
and so do you. Just in case.

01:40:26.083 --> 01:40:28.333
Time to pack.

01:41:57.375 --> 01:41:58.625
Jaap.

01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:03.167
-Wally.
-Jaap?

01:42:08.167 --> 01:42:10.542
I want to ask you something.

01:42:13.417 --> 01:42:15.917
In the event that...

01:42:16.083 --> 01:42:18.833
That won't happen. Really.

01:42:19.625 --> 01:42:24.125
No, but if you get out safely
and I don't...

01:42:25.167 --> 01:42:27.333
-will you tell Tilly...
-No.

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:32.167
I'll tell them to take me instead of you.
I'll just say I was van Tuyl.

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.417
-Yes, I'll say...
-Jaap.

01:42:43.208 --> 01:42:45.667
Will you tell Tilly that...

01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:54.250
that in my thoughts
I was always with her.

01:42:56.042 --> 01:42:58.042
And with the children.

01:43:03.833 --> 01:43:05.708
Tell the children that...

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.792
I know what I have to say.

01:43:23.458 --> 01:43:24.792
So tell me...

01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:30.250
what is the similarity between Rost
van Tonningen and the Dutch flag?

01:43:36.333 --> 01:43:39.750
They'll both hang after the liberation.

01:43:53.333 --> 01:43:57.458
Hold on just a little longer, Wally.
We're so close.

01:44:07.375 --> 01:44:09.875
You're being treated well, right?

01:44:13.958 --> 01:44:17.250
It's comfortable here, you've eaten.

01:44:20.292 --> 01:44:22.000
But now it's our turn.

01:44:26.125 --> 01:44:30.417
You'll describe exactly
how your organisation works.

01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:39.292
Before I forget, your wife
and mother send their regards.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:20.250
Herr van Tuyl?
Pleased to meet you.

01:45:22.417 --> 01:45:25.333
No.

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.125
Let him go.

01:45:27.833 --> 01:45:31.375
-No.
-It's not him. I am van Tuyl.

01:45:31.542 --> 01:45:35.000
Jaap, take care of Tilly.

01:45:35.167 --> 01:45:38.667
-Jaap.
-I hear you, Wally.

01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:40.875
Wally!

01:46:26.083 --> 01:46:28.875
I'm not interested in the why.

01:46:30.125 --> 01:46:32.917
I only want to know how you did it.

01:46:35.458 --> 01:46:38.917
Is it loans? With whom?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.625
Is it counterfeit money?
Does it come from London?

01:46:46.625 --> 01:46:49.708
And the Dutch Railways,
did you pay that as well?

01:46:50.125 --> 01:46:51.833
You'd need millions every week.

01:46:52.708 --> 01:46:55.667
A lot of money
for a second-rate banker.

01:46:59.708 --> 01:47:02.708
You didn't do this alone.
Impossible.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.250
Is Gijs involved as well?

01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:12.042
Viebahn is out there looking for him.
I can protect him.

01:47:12.583 --> 01:47:15.667
But then you must tell me everything.

01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:32.958
I'll tell you how I did it.

01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.750
I'm just smarter than you.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.625
Smarter?

01:47:52.917 --> 01:47:57.292
You'll be loaded onto a cart
and lined up with some other scum

01:47:57.542 --> 01:48:00.875
and you'll get a bullet in your head.

01:48:02.667 --> 01:48:07.000
Smarter than me?
I'll be lying in a warm bed.

01:48:14.875 --> 01:48:16.250
Meinoud?

01:48:21.875 --> 01:48:25.208
Enjoy it, for as long as it lasts.

01:49:10.833 --> 01:49:13.750
Get off, get off.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:17.917
-Get off.
-Faster, faster.

01:49:49.625 --> 01:49:52.083
Squad halt.

01:49:52.958 --> 01:49:54.542
Ready.

01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:57.750
Take aim.

01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:01.750
Fire.

01:51:35.333 --> 01:51:37.667
That was four months ago.

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:43.125
Could we have bought him off?
I'll never stop asking myself that.

01:51:44.583 --> 01:51:48.375
The resistance tracked down van Berkel
and took care of him.

01:51:54.292 --> 01:51:57.042
Huub was released
by the liberation army.

01:51:57.208 --> 01:51:59.958
He later got convicted
for helping the Germans.

01:52:00.125 --> 01:52:03.625
A 500-guilder fine, conditional.

01:52:05.875 --> 01:52:09.708
In May Rost van Tonningen
was arrested by the Canadians.

01:52:09.792 --> 01:52:11.458
Keep walking.

01:52:19.042 --> 01:52:22.417
Whether it was suicide or not
I can't tell you.

01:52:24.333 --> 01:52:28.583
It makes no difference.
For Wally it was too late.

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:39.750
So now you know how things stand...

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.500
regarding the money.

01:52:42.667 --> 01:52:46.417
Wally didn't talk.
No one else got arrested.

01:52:46.625 --> 01:52:49.917
We were able to continue lending aid
till the last day.

01:52:50.333 --> 01:52:53.875
His system worked.
We even have money left.

01:52:55.208 --> 01:52:58.583
With all respect,
but how do we know it's the truth?

01:52:58.750 --> 01:53:02.792
That nothing was siphoned off
to a Swiss bank account?

01:53:04.833 --> 01:53:08.958
This is the administration.
Everything has been documented.

01:53:09.458 --> 01:53:13.333
Every loan can be traced back,
every expenditure accounted for.

01:53:14.292 --> 01:53:18.083
The false treasury bonds
can be replaced and destroyed.

01:53:18.292 --> 01:53:21.708
Mr Ritter and I will personally
take care of that.

01:53:22.667 --> 01:53:25.542
I have seven briefcases
with claim forms at home

01:53:25.708 --> 01:53:28.250
but you can pick them up yourselves.

01:53:28.708 --> 01:53:31.583
So, if that was all...

01:53:39.292 --> 01:53:41.000
Mr van Hall.

01:53:41.708 --> 01:53:43.500
Your brother was a brave man.

01:53:43.667 --> 01:53:45.583
-A hero.
-Absolutely.

01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:50.583
Even so, I think it's better
to keep this story under wraps.

01:53:51.542 --> 01:53:53.250
And why?

01:53:54.167 --> 01:53:56.708
Good intentions aside...

01:53:57.208 --> 01:53:59.625
it remains bank fraud, of course.

01:53:59.792 --> 01:54:02.250
Abetted by our own banks.

01:54:02.458 --> 01:54:05.375
For the sake of national reconstruction,
I believe

01:54:05.542 --> 01:54:08.042
it's best to keep it to ourselves.

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:13.125
We'll have enough problems as it is.
But I'm sure you'll understand. Right?
