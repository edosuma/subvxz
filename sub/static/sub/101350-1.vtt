<i>Okay, class, today's song</i>
<i>is "The Clapping Song" by Shirley Ellis.</i>

00:23.125 --> 00:27.166
<i>When you sing, I want to hear every word</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:28.291
<i>Yumi?</i>

00:28.375 --> 00:30.083
<i>Can you sing it first, Amber?</i>

00:30.166 --> 00:33.333
<i>After we see how you do it,</i>
<i>we sing much better.</i>

00:33.416 --> 00:35.208
<i>Please!</i>

00:35.291 --> 00:38.125

<i>Um, but just the first verse.</i>

Thank you, thank you.
Okay. Is everyone ready?

00:56.583 --> 00:57.916
- Yes!
-Okay, stand up.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.583
Now,
what do we have to remember, my Divas?

01:00.666 --> 01:02.000
Sell the word!

01:02.083 --> 01:02.916
And?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.125
Soul claps!

01:04.208 --> 01:06.083
Exactly! Hit it, Father Chee.

Very nice!

01:36.916 --> 01:40.250
Father Chee. I need soul claps. Come on.

01:42.666 --> 01:44.833
All right, are you ready for this verse?

01:44.916 --> 01:48.125

Are you still hungry, Bobby Big Boy?

04:04.708 --> 04:05.750
Good job!

05:01.375 --> 05:02.208
Mom.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.375
- Hi, baby.
-You're late. Where have you been?

05:04.458 --> 05:06.666
I know, I know.
But I brought you something.

05:07.625 --> 05:08.500
Look.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.250
Got you some dinner.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.666
This is dessert.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.750
Who says dessert can't be dinner?

05:19.250 --> 05:21.291
- Uh, nutritionists?

05:21.375 --> 05:23.875
You telling me
nutritionists don’t like cheesecake?

05:26.416 --> 05:28.166
This is from the Copper Kettle.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.708
Did you sit at the bar?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.875
I had one glass of wine.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.083
-Just one.
-You're not supposed to have any.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.250
But it was-- It was just one.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.250
So Oliver’s back in the picture now?

05:40.333 --> 05:43.500
No! No, not really. This just--
This is a way to get us some dinner.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.208
This isn't dinner, Mom.

05:45.291 --> 05:48.541
You were supposed to look at apartments,
not get cheesecake from Oliver.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.041
Well, that's all that he could give me,
so I took it,

05:52.125 --> 05:54.750
and I'm sorry
that it's not good enough for you.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.041
That's not...

06:19.541 --> 06:20.916
Oh, it's so good.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.291
Oh, it's really good, Mom, actually.

06:25.625 --> 06:26.458
Here.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.791
-No. I don't want any.
-Have some. Don't be mad.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.166
-Just a little bite. I promise.
-I'm not mad.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.541
It's the best cheesecake
I've ever had and you're saying no.

06:43.041 --> 06:44.625
-Right?
-Yes!

06:44.708 --> 06:46.458
-It's very good.
-Oh, it's so good.

06:46.541 --> 06:49.500
-Oh! See? I told you!

06:50.541 --> 06:51.416
Mm.

06:52.458 --> 06:53.416
Thank you.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.083
You're welcome.

06:59.666 --> 07:01.875
<i>"Hope is the thing with feathers</i>

07:01.958 --> 07:03.833

07:04.375 --> 07:07.166
<i>And sings the tune without the words,</i>

07:07.291 --> 07:09.250
<i>And never stops at all,</i>

07:09.875 --> 07:12.250
<i>And sweetest in the gale is heard;</i>

07:12.333 --> 07:14.291

07:14.708 --> 07:16.833
<i>That could abash the little bird</i>

07:27.416 --> 07:29.375

07:37.041 --> 07:38.916
"Sore must be the storm."

07:46.958 --> 07:48.791
Some storm we're in, huh, baby?

07:51.750 --> 07:52.708
Yeah.

07:58.625 --> 07:59.500
I'm sorry.

08:00.791 --> 08:02.250
It's not your fault.

08:07.041 --> 08:08.250
We're gonna be okay.

08:11.166 --> 08:12.041
Okay?

08:13.458 --> 08:16.291
- Way to aim low, Mom.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.083
We're gonna be awesome.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.916
We're-- we're gonna be spectacular.

08:25.541 --> 08:26.708
That's my girl.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.125
Up and at 'em, kid.

09:15.625 --> 09:16.500
Bye, Mom.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.458
Bye, baby.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.750
-Have a great day!
-Thanks!

10:01.625 --> 10:03.250
Christian, John, good morning.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.875
Would you like a donut today?

10:05.041 --> 10:05.958
Thank you.

10:06.916 --> 10:07.958
Thanks.

10:09.791 --> 10:10.916
Good morning.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.083
-Donut?
-Thank you.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.041
Thanks.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.750
Hey, Mr. Linder. It's me, Amber.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.208
Amber Appleton.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.791
Remember me?

10:21.083 --> 10:21.916
Um...

10:22.458 --> 10:23.458
Uh...

10:23.541 --> 10:24.666
Are we related?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.250
No, I work here on the weekends,

10:27.333 --> 10:29.750
but I had some donuts,
so I thought I'd stop by.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.083
You want one?

10:35.583 --> 10:38.375
Careful, it's a category three
in there today.

10:38.666 --> 10:39.708
Could be worse.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.125
- Who is it?
-It's me!

10:45.208 --> 10:47.375
Oh, I thought so. Scram!

10:48.083 --> 10:49.625
- Morning, Joan.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.916
Has anyone ever told you
that you are loud?

10:53.041 --> 10:54.333
Good morning, Joan.

10:54.416 --> 10:57.375
-"Good" is a matter of opinion.
-Well, here's a fact:

10:57.458 --> 11:00.416
Rainbow sprinkled donut?
The best donut, and I saved it for you.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.083
Mm-mm. No, no.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.708
Okay. I'll eat it.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.833
Uh-uh!

11:13.041 --> 11:16.208
Some, uh, soothing entertainment
to start your morning?

11:16.291 --> 11:17.333
Yep.

11:25.208 --> 11:29.416
Right. Uh, could I use your shower?
Our water heater's still on the fritz.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.583
You know, when I was your age,
we didn't have hot showers.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.166
So, is that a no?

11:34.250 --> 11:35.750
Be my guest.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.375
Ooh. You wanna hear a joke?

11:39.500 --> 11:40.833
That's a no.

11:40.916 --> 11:42.625
You're gonna laugh this time. Ready?

11:42.708 --> 11:45.166
What do you call a fish with no eyes?

11:46.541 --> 11:47.541
Fsh!

11:50.250 --> 11:53.333
Careful, Joan. One of these days,
I <i>will</i> make you laugh.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.416
Not if I make you cry first.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.333
You couldn't make me cry if you tried.

12:14.666 --> 12:17.666
Ricky! Good morning! Breakfast!

12:26.541 --> 12:29.583
Ricky! Come on, dude, we have school!

12:32.208 --> 12:34.083
My BB-8 clock said 7:12.

12:34.916 --> 12:36.333
Yesterday, it was 7:13.

12:36.416 --> 12:38.458
Tuesday, it was 7:14.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.500
What's your point?

12:41.750 --> 12:44.416
You're waking me up
a minute earlier every day.

12:44.500 --> 12:48.083
You're on to me. The master plan is
to eventually wake you up at 4:00 a.m.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.125
Then midnight?

12:49.208 --> 12:50.125
Then yesterday.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.083
Before I even go to sleep!

12:52.166 --> 12:54.708
Which would totally suck,
but might be sort of cool,

12:54.791 --> 12:57.541
because then we could eat breakfast
together and stay up all night.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.000
Uh-huh. Your mom's home.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.250
She's early, too.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.791
-It's a conspiracy.
- No!

13:03.041 --> 13:04.750
Good morning, Donna.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.041
-Hey, you two.
-Hey, Mom.

13:06.125 --> 13:06.958
How was work?

13:07.041 --> 13:10.875
The night shift.
It's, uh... life's rich pageant.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.125
Amber! Ty's here!

13:43.083 --> 13:44.833
Please, don't get up.

13:44.916 --> 13:45.750
Amber!

13:47.125 --> 13:48.541
You left this on the counter.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.791
Right. Thank you.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.458
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetie.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.750
Have a great day, Amber.

13:54.833 --> 13:55.791
Always.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.708
Hendrix? Fox and Fox.

14:03.791 --> 14:04.916
-Hey, Amber.
-Hey.

14:06.041 --> 14:07.000
Hey.

14:07.375 --> 14:08.375
Hi.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.541
Hey, Jordan, is that a coloring book?

14:10.625 --> 14:12.583
Because there are <i>Marquez</i>
all over the pages.

14:12.666 --> 14:13.750
Impressive.

14:14.583 --> 14:15.666
Thanks.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.416
We've had 31 days of school,
that's 31 rides.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.375
Thirty-one sandwiches, too, am I right?

14:40.458 --> 14:43.291
-So many sandwiches.
-Okay, seriously, Ty deserves a sandwich

14:43.375 --> 14:45.916
because he has to leave the house
way earlier than the rest of us.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.125
-And I'm the only one who owns a car.
-That's true.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.666
-A car? Okay. Well, this... Not a car.
-Technically, I don't think you own it.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.416
He's the only one with access to a car.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.708
-Yes, thank you. Access.
- Call it a vehicle.

14:55.791 --> 14:58.583
I still fail to see how any of this
warrants a sandwich.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.250
-Thank you.
-Just sayin'.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.125
I think Amber's got a crush on Ty.
That's why she makes him a sandwich.

Do you guys realize the marching band's
been playing all year without a tuba?

15:30.291 --> 15:32.208
Somebody stole it over the summer.

15:32.291 --> 15:35.291
Yeah, look at Ryan Gold. She looks weird.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.083
She looks sad.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.166
They’ve played half
the football season without it.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.916
Now that state championships are
coming up, if they don’t have a tuba,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.916
-they’re automatically disqualified.
<i>-</i>Okay, but who steals a tuba?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.916
Someone who’s really <i>horny</i> for it.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.916
It’s technically a sousaphone.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.166
You could get a lot of cash for one
on the dark web.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.541
Why don't they get another one?
Borrow it or rent it, I don't know.

15:54.625 --> 15:57.250
Sure, Ty. Why don’t you just lend Ryan
your extra tuba?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.208
-"Sousaphone."
-Nobody’s stepped up.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.416
About three, four grand should do it
for a proper marching model.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.291
Is she on the dark web right now?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.083
I say we make the tuba this year’s cause
for the Variety Show.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.500
Doesn't the school decide that?

16:09.583 --> 16:12.250
Amber runs the Variety Show.
She started it.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.375
But how do we get people excited
over a tuba?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.708
Oh, my God, "sousaphone."

16:15.791 --> 16:18.583
I don't know, but we have to.
Just look at Ryan.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.500
-Hey, Amber.
-Hey, Leah.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.708
Leah is awesome. You know, she's
auditioning for <i>Oklahoma! </i>this year?

16:29.791 --> 16:30.791
Is that right?

16:30.875 --> 16:32.791
-You know where this is going, Ty.
<i>-</i>Yeah, I do.

16:32.875 --> 16:36.125
Come on! Mr. Franks thinks
you'd make a great Curly. We all do.

16:36.208 --> 16:37.958
-We need you this year.
-I don't know.

16:38.041 --> 16:41.166
Getting on stage in front
of all those people, it's terrifying.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.500
You play soccer
in front of all those people.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.541
Yeah, but I don't have to bust out
with a show tune.

16:46.625 --> 16:47.958
Or wear a cowboy hat.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.375
I think you'd look great in a cowboy hat.

16:54.291 --> 16:57.000
I've been trying to text you,
but I keep on getting delivery failure.

16:57.791 --> 17:00.875
Yeah. Uh, that's a whole thing.

17:00.958 --> 17:04.916
I lost my phone, and I haven't had
a chance to get a new one yet.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.250
I was hoping we could have, like...

17:07.916 --> 17:09.500
a private conversation.

17:09.583 --> 17:12.458
Cell phones aren't private.
It's much better to stay off-grid.

17:12.541 --> 17:16.125
Plus, I'm the only teenager in all
of America who doesn't have a cell phone.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.041
How cool is that?

17:17.625 --> 17:18.916
Not cool at all?

17:20.041 --> 17:23.208
So, it--it takes place in, um,
I'm assuming Oklahoma.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.958
Yes! So, that's why...

17:28.916 --> 17:30.500
That's why we're trying to bring you in.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.750
-All right, you got it.
-That whole dynamic going on...

17:35.000 --> 17:36.166
Hey, guys.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.708
-Hey, Mr. Franks.
-Franks!

17:39.500 --> 17:41.083
Dig your shirt. Mr. Franks.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.583
That's very nice of you.
Thank you very much.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.291
Yeah, what's, uh, going on over there?

17:45.375 --> 17:47.833
You know, it's just sort of
some outdoor tableaus.

17:47.916 --> 17:52.958
You know, some people listening
to music, and sitting on a park bench.

17:53.041 --> 17:55.833
-Trees, and tennis, and...
- It's stylish. I like it.

17:55.916 --> 17:58.333
I like it. Do one of 'em have a--
One has a mullet.

17:58.416 --> 18:01.083
-It's very '80s. I like that.
- Yeah, it's very you. We approve.

18:01.166 --> 18:03.125
-Franks.
- Not necessarily the '80s, but...

18:03.208 --> 18:04.666
-Oh, maybe it is.
-Mr. Franks?

18:04.750 --> 18:05.791
Appleton?

18:06.291 --> 18:07.625
Can I show you something?

18:08.375 --> 18:09.416
Sure.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.833
-Just...
-What am I looking at?

18:17.958 --> 18:19.000
Whoa!

18:19.958 --> 18:21.583
Wow, look at that!

18:22.333 --> 18:23.833
-Does that mean that I--
-Yeah.

18:23.916 --> 18:26.291
You're being asked to audition
at Carnegie Mellon.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.291
-Amber's going to Pittsburgh. Look!
-What?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.416
Of course she is.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.958
-That's amazing.
-No way!

18:32.333 --> 18:33.958
This is your dream, Amber.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.083
That's incredible! Oh, my God!

18:36.166 --> 18:38.125
What song are you going to sing?

18:38.208 --> 18:40.958
Pittsburgh? How are you
going to get to Pittsburgh?

19:11.375 --> 19:12.375
Good boy.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.250
Mom?

19:43.000 --> 19:43.958
Hey.

19:45.541 --> 19:46.416
Bobby.

19:46.916 --> 19:47.750
Hey.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.208
Shh.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.583
I'm sorry, baby.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.625
I was so tired, I just fell asleep.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.583
At Oliver's.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.125
You have his truck.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.083
He's asked us to move in.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.000
And I think we should do it.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.791
So everything's fine now?

21:59.416 --> 22:00.708
He has a good side.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.583
Yeah, and a bad side.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.166
We're gonna get caught.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.666
And it is getting cold outside.

22:15.083 --> 22:18.375
I'd rather freeze my ass off on a bus
than go back to Oliver's.

22:18.458 --> 22:21.041
Why? He wants to help,

22:21.125 --> 22:23.791
and we still don't have enough money
for an apartment.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.875
What if we tried the shelter again?

22:29.666 --> 22:32.833
No, I'm not going to the shelter. No.

22:32.916 --> 22:36.500
So that I can have people
questioning my parenting?

22:36.916 --> 22:40.541
No one can find out about us.
You understand?

22:40.875 --> 22:42.708
Because if they do, I'll lose you.

22:43.708 --> 22:46.458
Let's just talk about this
when you're in a better mood.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.333
I got invited to audition
for Carnegie Mellon.

23:14.666 --> 23:15.666
What?

23:21.666 --> 23:23.125
My God.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.666
Your dad would be so proud.

23:33.666 --> 23:36.208
How does it work? You sing for them?

23:36.291 --> 23:38.416
Yeah. And then they crush my dreams.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.500
They won't. You're gonna be great.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.250
How am I even gonna get to Pittsburgh?

23:47.458 --> 23:49.416
You've been saving money, right?

23:50.833 --> 23:53.125
Yeah, for an apartment,
not some stupid audition.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.583
No, you buy that ticket.

23:55.541 --> 23:57.166
Because this is your dream.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.041
You see?

24:05.791 --> 24:07.291
Things are lookin' up.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.291
We're gonna be great.

24:14.041 --> 24:15.166
Without Oliver.

24:21.375 --> 24:22.750
Okay.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.000
Okay.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.000
So what's with you today?

24:44.083 --> 24:47.250
You're not yappin' all over the game
like you usually do.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.708
Nothing. I'm just thinking.

24:51.166 --> 24:53.000
About that boyfriend of yours?

24:54.458 --> 24:55.875
I don't have a boyfriend.

24:56.458 --> 24:58.416
Ty's a friend. We're buds.

24:58.625 --> 25:00.500
"Buds." Buds, yeah.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.833
Have you hooked up with him yet?

25:02.916 --> 25:03.750
Joan!

25:03.833 --> 25:07.916
Get over it,
and quit wasting your time thinking.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.416
Youth is precious, so you should enjoy it.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.708
That's the most positive thing
I think I've ever heard you say.

25:15.791 --> 25:21.500
Well, it's just another way of saying
that life is nasty, brutish, and short.

25:21.750 --> 25:22.958
And then you die.

25:24.541 --> 25:25.958
That's my Joanie.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Ooh.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.083
Okay, Ricky.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.791
Egg puns. Go.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.083
Oh, um, okay.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.750
Well, I only know a few,
so this will be <i>over easy.</i>

25:48.291 --> 25:50.125
<i>Omelet</i> you use that one if you want.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.041
Okay.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.125
You can <i>poach</i> it.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.750
Ooh, nice.

25:54.375 --> 25:56.333
Yeah, it's funny, because...

25:56.583 --> 25:58.958
I usually only eat eggs
around <i>hollandaise.</i>

26:00.583 --> 26:02.125
-Good morning, honey.
-Good morning, Mom.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.666
-Hey.
-Sorry, did we wake you up?

26:03.750 --> 26:05.916
No, I was up already.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.625
Can I talk to you for a minute?

26:08.291 --> 26:09.250
Yeah.

26:13.666 --> 26:15.583
I noticed you've been using my makeup.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.250
Oh. Donna, I'm so sorry.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.708
It's okay. I used to dip
into my sister's makeup all the time,

26:21.791 --> 26:23.791
but it's kind of gross. So...

26:24.666 --> 26:25.916
I got you this.

26:38.791 --> 26:39.625
Thank you.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.291
But I can't take this.

26:43.416 --> 26:45.000
What do you mean? Sure you can.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.041
No, I just-- I don't wear makeup.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.166
I was practicing. I'm really sorry.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.458
It's a gift.

26:50.541 --> 26:53.125
I know, and it's really great. I just--

26:53.666 --> 26:54.583
I don't need it.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.583
Amber, are you all right?

27:00.458 --> 27:02.958
Yeah, I'm great. Never better.

27:11.375 --> 27:14.625
Poetry. Sweet. Thank you.

27:14.916 --> 27:17.666
The tuba's a great cause,
and I know you'd shine up there.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.333
I don't have any real skills, Amber.

27:19.416 --> 27:22.791
Sure, you do. When you close your eyes,
what do you imagine yourself doing?

27:22.875 --> 27:24.500
Tommy, you're going to kill it.

27:24.583 --> 27:25.708
But what if I eat it?

27:25.791 --> 27:26.916
You won't! You won't!

27:27.000 --> 27:28.750
Okay. Okay, fine. Fine.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.500
-Awesome, can't wait to hear it.
-Thank you.

27:30.583 --> 27:31.541
Thanks so much.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.625
Okay. So, Ricky's gonna do a pun-off.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.541
-Put me down as Lingo Starr.
-I love it.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.375
Chad, you're going to wow us
with some thespianism, right?

27:39.458 --> 27:41.541
-That's the plan.
-Awesome. Ty?

27:41.750 --> 27:45.708
Uh, I thought I'd stage manage.
Help out with the behind-the-scenes stuff.

27:45.791 --> 27:48.666
Come on! You've gotta do something
up there. You're so talented.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.708
He’s only good at soccer
as far as we know.

27:50.916 --> 27:52.458
He does have some talent.

27:52.541 --> 27:55.000
Exactly! And this is your chance
to show everyone

27:55.083 --> 27:58.708
how very talented you are,
and also charismatic.

27:58.791 --> 28:00.958
So, think about it, please?

28:01.916 --> 28:04.250
-Okay, yeah, I'll think about it.
-Yes! All right.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.375
Jordan?

28:05.583 --> 28:07.458
I'll be performing an Argentine tango.

28:07.916 --> 28:10.541
-Oh.
-An Argentine tango.

28:10.625 --> 28:11.541
Correct.

28:11.625 --> 28:15.416
I can finally tell you my sister watches
a little too much <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

28:15.500 --> 28:18.375
A, That is a lie. B, please
put me down for an Argentine tango.

28:18.458 --> 28:21.291
You do realize it takes two human beings
to tango, right?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.583
Put me down as “Jordan and TBD.”

28:25.458 --> 28:27.416
Okay. Uh, Franksie?

28:27.625 --> 28:31.208
Me? No. This is for you guys.
I'm not gonna get involved.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.541
-What? Are you kidding?
-Come on, man. Really?

28:33.625 --> 28:35.541
-You have to help us out.
- Do it.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.333
-Are you sure?
- Yes, we're sure.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.291
All right. I'll think of something.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.791
"All the world's a stage.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.208
The end."

28:44.291 --> 28:47.208
Right? Is that what it is? I don't know.
I have work to do, guys.

28:48.208 --> 28:51.333
Two-forty, 260, 280, 300.

28:51.541 --> 28:54.500
Okay, you know the school can help foot
the bill for this.

28:54.583 --> 28:57.250
There's this discretionary fund
for students in need.

28:57.333 --> 29:00.416
Okay, but I'm not in need. I am flush.

29:01.541 --> 29:02.375
All right.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.333
One ticket to Pittsburgh, coming right up.

29:05.958 --> 29:08.375
Carnegie Mellon will not know
what hit them.

29:45.208 --> 29:46.250
What's going on?

29:48.666 --> 29:49.666
They found out.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.125
Who found out?

29:51.708 --> 29:52.750
Who do you think?

29:53.583 --> 29:54.541
I got fired.

29:57.791 --> 29:59.416
Good riddance.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.125
You're drunk.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.500
I got fired.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.708
I got fired. I had two drinks.
I'm not drunk.

30:10.625 --> 30:11.791
How did they find out?

30:12.541 --> 30:13.500
I don't know.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.000
Did you say something?

30:15.916 --> 30:17.791
Did we leave something behind?

30:17.875 --> 30:19.958
It doesn't matter. They found out.

30:25.375 --> 30:26.291
Who was that?

30:27.250 --> 30:28.750
Oliver's coming to pick us up.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.125
I can't believe you.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.791
Amber!

30:55.041 --> 30:56.000
Hey.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.083
Yeah.

31:11.708 --> 31:13.333
I know. I'm sorry.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.333
We'll just sit here.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.125
No, no, no.

32:45.333 --> 32:46.666
My backpack.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.041
I had my money in there.

32:53.166 --> 32:54.541
My school books.

32:57.750 --> 32:58.750
My dad's hoodie.

33:01.916 --> 33:03.208
It's all gone.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.458
It's okay.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.416
Hey, it's okay.

33:11.666 --> 33:12.625
No, it's not.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.666
I don't know what to do, Ty.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.541
My mom's gonna be looking for me,

33:22.500 --> 33:24.250
and I can't go back to Oliver's.

33:27.958 --> 33:28.833
Let's just...

33:29.958 --> 33:31.791
Let's think about this, okay?

33:33.375 --> 33:34.416
Today's Saturday.

33:34.916 --> 33:36.541
We don't have school on Monday.

33:41.875 --> 33:43.083
I have an idea.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.500
Just...

33:46.041 --> 33:48.083
trust me, okay?

would do Amber a lot of good.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.291
Plus, we've got such
a good piano up here,

36:10.375 --> 36:12.125
I don't see why we wouldn't use it.

36:14.666 --> 36:15.500
Yeah.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.916
No, I get that. I'm sorry.
You're right. I should have told you.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.750
She's just a friend, Mom.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.833

we're gonna be practicing.

"Feels Like Home."

36:44.000 --> 36:44.875
My dad wrote it.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.041
He was...

36:53.458 --> 36:55.250
an amazing musician.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.208
And singer.

36:58.291 --> 36:59.833
Runs in the family, I guess.

39:55.583 --> 39:56.583
Terrible.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.625
I'm sorry, but you have zero talent.

40:00.708 --> 40:01.708
It was just...

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
That was embarrassing.
I was embarrassed for you.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.166
Yeah, you're the worst.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.333
He wrote that song for my mom.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.041
I was twelve.

40:31.333 --> 40:32.833
It was a heart thing.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.583
Never even knew
anything was wrong with it.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.000
My mom tried to keep it together.

40:46.416 --> 40:49.125
She just didn't have any family around.

40:50.041 --> 40:53.500
So little by little,
things started to go downhill.

40:57.666 --> 41:00.375
When we got evicted,
we moved in with Oliver.

41:04.791 --> 41:07.333
First night we got there,
they went out drinking.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.291
She'd been sober for five months.

41:18.333 --> 41:19.916
Then one night, he hit her.

41:21.791 --> 41:23.000
And we moved out,

41:24.333 --> 41:25.333
to the bus.

41:28.833 --> 41:31.125
We're going to figure something out,
all right?

41:33.458 --> 41:34.333
Yeah.

41:37.125 --> 41:38.041
Yeah.

42:03.916 --> 42:05.583
Good morning!

42:13.041 --> 42:14.750
It's pretty nice, huh?

42:23.750 --> 42:24.583
No.

42:30.750 --> 42:33.458
-What's so funny?

43:12.541 --> 43:13.458
Thanks.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.791
This has been really great.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Anytime.

43:54.458 --> 43:55.500
You sure about this?

43:57.708 --> 43:58.541
Yeah.

43:59.875 --> 44:00.833
I trust Donna.

44:20.750 --> 44:21.916
Oh, hey, Amber.

44:22.333 --> 44:25.666
Ricky's over at Chad and Jordan's
practicing for the Variety Show.

44:27.083 --> 44:29.541
Yeah, I actually came to see you.

44:30.375 --> 44:31.250
Okay.

44:35.875 --> 44:37.500
I need to tell you something.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.916
I don't understand what's going on here.

44:50.583 --> 44:53.500
We just want to discuss
some things with you, Becky.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.166
Well, I, uh, came here to pick up
my daughter,

44:56.666 --> 44:59.375
because she was missing all weekend
and I was worried sick,

44:59.458 --> 45:02.041
and I don't really want to discuss
anything with you.

45:02.125 --> 45:03.083
So, Amber, let's go.

45:07.458 --> 45:08.791
Don't look at her.

45:08.875 --> 45:10.875
What are you looking at her for?

45:12.541 --> 45:16.291
Amber wants you to know she doesn't feel
comfortable living at Oliver's.

45:19.916 --> 45:20.791
Oh.

45:22.750 --> 45:25.541
So you two talked about everything, huh?

45:30.458 --> 45:33.416
Well, it may not be comfortable,
but that is where we live now.

45:34.208 --> 45:35.833
I don't wanna live there again.

45:36.541 --> 45:37.791
I don't feel safe.

45:38.708 --> 45:40.291
You felt safer living on a bus?

45:40.375 --> 45:41.541
I just think--

45:41.625 --> 45:43.041
I don't care what you think.

45:43.375 --> 45:45.125
Amber, let's go.

45:45.708 --> 45:49.041
Donna says I can stay here for
a few nights, until we figure this out.

45:49.125 --> 45:51.125
No. Absolutely not. No.

45:51.208 --> 45:52.750
- It's okay, Becky.
-No, it's not.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.125
Who-- Who do you think you are? Really?

45:55.208 --> 45:56.666
It is not okay.

45:56.750 --> 45:59.583
She is my daughter.
She stays with me.

45:59.666 --> 46:00.833
-Calm down.
-I am calm.

46:00.916 --> 46:03.708
I'm not going anywhere with you
until you move out of Oliver's.

46:04.291 --> 46:06.375
If you keep her here,
I'm calling the cops.

46:06.458 --> 46:08.166
Well, maybe that's not a bad idea.

46:08.250 --> 46:11.000
Maybe we all need to have
a conversation about this.

46:14.625 --> 46:15.666
I'm the mother.

46:17.041 --> 46:19.416
I'm the one that keeps things together.

46:19.708 --> 46:22.416
Really, Mom? You do that? I had no idea.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.708
I'm trying.

46:23.833 --> 46:26.958
Can't you-- You can't see
that I'm trying to take care of you?

46:27.041 --> 46:27.958
I'm doing my best.

46:28.041 --> 46:29.833
Well, your best isn't good enough.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.416
Okay.

46:36.125 --> 46:37.208
Then stay here.

46:38.125 --> 46:41.041
Stay here for the rest of your life
for all I care.

46:43.791 --> 46:44.666
Mom!

46:48.125 --> 46:49.083
Mom!

46:50.083 --> 46:52.083
Don't go back there. Please?

46:52.833 --> 46:53.958
Then where do I go?

46:56.041 --> 46:57.291
What am I supposed to do?

46:59.291 --> 47:00.708
You need help.

47:01.166 --> 47:04.166
And we can get you help.
We can start over.

47:04.291 --> 47:05.458
"Start over."

47:11.541 --> 47:14.916
Life is so much more complicated
than you think, baby.

47:45.666 --> 47:47.125
You got everything you need?

47:48.125 --> 47:49.416
-Yeah.
-Okay.

47:51.416 --> 47:53.916
I'm really sorry for putting you
in the middle of all this.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.416
Hey, no.

47:56.500 --> 48:00.083
You have nothing...
nothing to be sorry about.

48:02.750 --> 48:05.958
Just... try to get some rest, okay?

48:08.083 --> 48:09.208
Okay.

48:11.375 --> 48:12.250
Good night.

48:14.458 --> 48:15.625
Good night, Donna.

48:43.166 --> 48:46.458
The Executive Branch
had three departments.

48:46.583 --> 48:48.375
There was the Department of State,

48:48.458 --> 48:50.666
which was led by Thomas Jefferson.

48:50.750 --> 48:52.875
There was the Department of Treasury,

48:52.958 --> 48:54.583
-which was led by--

48:54.875 --> 48:57.416
Hey. I need to speak with Amber.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.333
Oh, sure. Uh, Amber?

49:00.125 --> 49:00.958
Ooh!

49:01.041 --> 49:02.583
Okay, that's enough.

49:04.125 --> 49:05.458
Amber, bring your things.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.375
Have a seat.

49:15.250 --> 49:18.666
Amber, this is Officer Rozick
and Officer Garland.

49:18.750 --> 49:20.083
I know what this is about.

49:21.541 --> 49:22.666
My mom called, right?

49:25.291 --> 49:26.750
I'll be right outside.

49:34.333 --> 49:37.166
Amber, your mother, Rebecca Appleton,

49:37.250 --> 49:40.583
was involved in an automobile accident
early this morning.

49:42.416 --> 49:45.041
We're sorry to have to tell you,
but she died of her injuries

49:45.125 --> 49:46.625
on the way to the hospital.

49:50.208 --> 49:53.375
Amber, do you have any friends
or relatives you can stay with tonight?

49:55.416 --> 49:56.291
Yeah.

49:56.958 --> 49:59.166
Okay. We'll need to contact them.

49:59.250 --> 50:02.250
We also need you to come with us
to answer a few questions.

50:06.458 --> 50:07.625
Was she driving?

50:08.875 --> 50:10.291
She was the passenger.

50:11.041 --> 50:14.916
The driver... also died in the collision.

50:17.166 --> 50:18.416
Did anyone else get hurt?

50:19.333 --> 50:21.375
It was a single-vehicle accident.

50:29.333 --> 50:30.250
He was drunk.

50:33.166 --> 50:34.750
Oliver. He was drunk, right?

50:36.000 --> 50:37.083
They both were.

50:38.250 --> 50:41.500
The cause of the accident
is still being investigated.

50:45.583 --> 50:47.500
I'm sorry. I need to use the bathroom.

53:16.416 --> 53:18.958
That's why I think it makes
more sense if Leah comes after.

53:19.041 --> 53:20.666
Right. And then I follow.

53:23.083 --> 53:24.250
- That works.
- Yeah.

53:24.333 --> 53:25.583
What do you think, Amber?

53:26.333 --> 53:27.291
Hmm?

53:28.041 --> 53:30.583
Should I go before or after
Leah's juggling act?

53:31.916 --> 53:34.791
Uh, it's... Whatever you guys want.

53:36.083 --> 53:38.458
-After's fine.
-Yeah. Yeah, that'd be good.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.583
When a verb ends in a silent "e,"
drop the "e"

53:57.666 --> 53:59.875
and add "ed" to form the past tense.

53:59.958 --> 54:02.500
"Joke" to "joked." "Hope" to "hoped."

54:03.000 --> 54:04.625
Aren't we going to sing, Amber?

54:06.916 --> 54:07.750
No.

54:08.250 --> 54:09.208
Not today.

54:09.625 --> 54:11.375
Oh, but we love singing.

54:19.208 --> 54:20.208
Sorry.

54:26.416 --> 54:29.083
I bet you're sick of people asking you
if you're okay.

54:38.416 --> 54:39.833
I ran away from her.

54:43.750 --> 54:46.166
I went to your fancy vacation house.

54:47.541 --> 54:50.291
I had fun while she needed me.

54:52.750 --> 54:53.833
Amber...

54:55.833 --> 54:57.291
this is not your fault.

55:01.375 --> 55:03.666
Then I came back, and I pushed her away.

55:09.916 --> 55:10.958
This is on me.

56:42.750 --> 56:43.625
Hey.

56:47.541 --> 56:49.166
Ready for Pittsburgh tomorrow?

56:49.916 --> 56:51.208
Yeah, sure.

56:54.375 --> 56:58.666
Listen, I can only imagine
how hard it is for you right now.

56:59.875 --> 57:00.750
But...

57:02.250 --> 57:03.750
you know, your talent,

57:04.416 --> 57:07.041
the reason you earned this opportunity,

57:07.125 --> 57:08.083
that's still there.

57:08.166 --> 57:09.416
That doesn't go away.

57:09.583 --> 57:10.708
It's still in here.

57:13.125 --> 57:16.083
So, the pain that you're feeling,

57:17.375 --> 57:18.625
you know, the grief...

57:19.916 --> 57:21.916
I think you just-- just channel it.

57:23.375 --> 57:26.000
Channel it, put it into your song.

57:27.500 --> 57:29.541
Because that's what an artist does.

57:30.708 --> 57:31.541
And you...

57:32.875 --> 57:33.875
You're an artist.

57:38.916 --> 57:40.250
Thank you, Mr. Franks.

57:42.166 --> 57:45.041
You have to finish your food,
you can't just stare at it.

57:48.250 --> 57:49.500
So your flight's at nine.

57:49.583 --> 57:52.333
I figured we'd leave for the airport
at 7:00 a.m. the latest,

57:52.416 --> 57:53.375
maybe even 6:30.

57:56.333 --> 57:58.500
And, um, you're all set up for the dorm

57:58.583 --> 58:00.750
and the student is gonna
show you around.

58:00.916 --> 58:01.791
Yeah.

58:02.083 --> 58:03.750
You have enough money for the cab?

58:04.416 --> 58:05.375
Yeah, I'm good.

58:33.083 --> 58:34.041
Bobby?

58:40.375 --> 58:41.333
Bobby.

58:44.083 --> 58:45.750
No, no, no.

58:54.541 --> 58:55.500
How is he?

58:59.541 --> 59:01.666
Bobby has a mass on his spleen.

59:01.750 --> 59:04.083
That's what's been causing his discomfort.

59:04.958 --> 59:06.750
A mass? Is that cancer?

59:08.125 --> 59:09.083
I don't know yet.

59:09.541 --> 59:12.208
But either way,
the treatment is exactly the same...

59:12.291 --> 59:14.958
We'll need to do surgery
to remove the mass.

59:15.041 --> 59:18.208
If that's successful,
he could make a full recovery.

59:30.041 --> 59:31.583
Amber, where have you been?

59:31.875 --> 59:33.291
You missed your flight.

59:35.958 --> 59:37.291
Is everything okay?

59:40.958 --> 59:41.916
No.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.083
So that's twelve dollars an hour.

59:47.708 --> 59:50.208
Uh, and the most I could work
is a ten-hour shift?

59:52.750 --> 59:54.833
And overtime is time-and-a-half.

59:57.833 --> 1:00:00.791
Okay, thank you, Lloyd. I appreciate it.

1:00:03.708 --> 1:00:04.791
How's he feeling?

1:00:05.708 --> 1:00:07.458
I gave him another painkiller.

1:00:11.250 --> 1:00:14.583
Well, um, I explained everything
to the Admissions Office,

1:00:14.666 --> 1:00:16.541
and they were very understanding.

1:00:17.833 --> 1:00:20.291
I think they can get you
another audition slot.

1:00:23.458 --> 1:00:24.666
I'm not going.

1:00:25.375 --> 1:00:27.250
Amber, if it's about the plane ticket,

1:00:27.333 --> 1:00:29.583
-you don't have to--
-I can't audition, Donna.

1:00:30.375 --> 1:00:31.916
Not until Bobby gets better.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.875
Lloyd has hired Amber
full-time at the donut shop.

1:00:34.958 --> 1:00:38.083
Also, she added to her hours
at the retirement home.

1:00:38.166 --> 1:00:41.000
If she works 70 hours a week
at minimum wage,

1:00:41.083 --> 1:00:44.375
she could pay for Bobby's surgery
in ten-and-a-half weeks.

1:00:44.625 --> 1:00:47.375
You can't work 70 hours a week
and go to school.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:48.875
I'm dropping out.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.375
Dropping out? Amber, honey.

1:00:51.458 --> 1:00:53.666
No, you can't do that,
you can't throw everything away.

1:00:53.750 --> 1:00:55.708
Donna, I really appreciate
everything you've done--

1:00:55.791 --> 1:00:58.875
It's not about that.
It's about you and your future.

1:00:58.958 --> 1:01:02.875
You have so much to look forward to,
and so much talent. I can't let you--

1:01:02.958 --> 1:01:03.875
Stop!

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:07.333
You're not her.

1:01:14.291 --> 1:01:15.500
You're not who?

1:01:43.166 --> 1:01:44.291
What's going on?

1:01:47.708 --> 1:01:49.500
You can't just drop out of school.

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:54.666
Ty, look, I am so tired.
I just can't right now.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:58.541
Look, I'm really sorry about Bobby.

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:04.083
He's awesome. And I know
that he's really important to you, but--

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:05.125
Don't.

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:08.625
Don't say he's just a dog.

1:02:10.625 --> 1:02:12.375
Because he's not. Not to me.

1:02:13.791 --> 1:02:14.708
Okay.

1:02:16.791 --> 1:02:18.208
You need money, right?

1:02:19.291 --> 1:02:21.125
Let me help you. I can ask my parents.

1:02:21.208 --> 1:02:23.458
-I'm handling it.
-Listen to me, it can be a loan.

1:02:23.541 --> 1:02:26.375
Okay? You can pay them back slowly
while you finish school--

1:02:26.458 --> 1:02:28.458
Ty, stop! I have this under control.

1:02:28.541 --> 1:02:30.416
Damn it, Amber, you are so stubborn!

1:02:32.708 --> 1:02:34.375
You do so much for other people,

1:02:34.458 --> 1:02:37.416
but when you need just a little bit
of help, you push us all away.

1:02:37.708 --> 1:02:39.500
What is so bad about needing help?

1:02:40.791 --> 1:02:42.833
Like, if you don't do this
on your own, you're weak?

1:02:43.208 --> 1:02:44.333
Good job, Ty,

1:02:45.125 --> 1:02:46.291
you figured it out.

1:02:47.083 --> 1:02:49.625
I bet part of you is glad
that you missed the audition.

1:02:52.291 --> 1:02:53.541
Bobby got sick,

1:02:53.625 --> 1:02:57.000
and you got an excuse to punish yourself
for letting your mom down,

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.708
which you didn't do.

1:02:59.666 --> 1:03:01.000
You're suffering.

1:03:01.083 --> 1:03:03.583
You're suffering, and you won't admit it.

1:03:03.666 --> 1:03:06.791
You expect the rest of us to sit by
and watch you go down the drain,

1:03:06.916 --> 1:03:07.916
and that is not fair!

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:08.875
"Not fair?"

1:03:09.833 --> 1:03:13.333
I'm sorry, that must really suck,
life not being fair.

1:03:14.083 --> 1:03:16.416
You know what you should do
to make yourself feel better?

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:20.166
I don't know, you should hang out with
your two parents at your vacation home.

1:03:20.916 --> 1:03:24.750
Maybe that'll help you get over life
and its <i>vast</i> unfairness.

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:26.708
-Amber--
-Leave me alone!

1:03:29.625 --> 1:03:30.625
Just leave me alone.

1:03:49.125 --> 1:03:50.083
Thank you.

1:03:51.416 --> 1:03:54.708
Take the rack, both sides in,

1:03:55.583 --> 1:03:56.875
and you slowly...

1:03:59.541 --> 1:04:00.916
drop them into the oil.

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.000
You wanna try it?

1:04:02.416 --> 1:04:03.416
Sure.

from all your loud singing,

1:05:55.750 --> 1:05:57.708
and talking, and terrible jokes.

1:05:58.916 --> 1:06:01.125
In fact, if you happen
to see the old Amber,

1:06:01.208 --> 1:06:03.166
well, you can tell her that...

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:07.000
it was a living hell
just being around her.

1:06:07.083 --> 1:06:10.250
All that disgusting cheer and helpfulness.

1:06:11.125 --> 1:06:12.375
Optimism.

1:06:15.083 --> 1:06:16.583
Well, she was insufferable.

1:06:54.666 --> 1:06:55.500
Hey.

1:06:59.166 --> 1:07:00.000
Hi.

1:07:08.333 --> 1:07:09.375
I can't go.

1:07:15.083 --> 1:07:18.291
You've been putting this show on
for the last three years.

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.583
It's the last one you'll ever get to see.

1:07:23.333 --> 1:07:24.333
It's your night.

1:07:26.583 --> 1:07:27.500
Sorry.

1:07:28.333 --> 1:07:29.666
I have to finish my shift.

1:07:30.583 --> 1:07:31.750
No, you don't.

1:07:33.791 --> 1:07:34.708
We're closed.

1:07:35.083 --> 1:07:36.958
No. We close at midnight.

1:07:37.125 --> 1:07:39.833
Usually, but we're out of donuts.

1:07:48.375 --> 1:07:49.833
These have been impounded.

1:07:51.708 --> 1:07:52.541
Lloyd...

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:53.583
Amber.

1:07:55.666 --> 1:07:57.333
Go. Be with your friends.

Why are all those people here?

Must be really into supporting
brass instruments, I guess.

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:44.875
Ty, that's way too many people
for the Variety Show.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:46.958
You think it's a lot of people?

1:08:47.041 --> 1:08:48.291
I feel like there's...

1:08:49.875 --> 1:08:52.250
a normal amount of people. Um...

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:55.083
Okay. All right. Yeah. Um...

1:08:56.875 --> 1:08:58.750
We ended up changing the...

1:09:00.041 --> 1:09:03.166
We ended up changing the proceeds
to going to Bobby Big Boy's surgery.

1:09:03.541 --> 1:09:05.500
-What?
-I know. Yeah, I know.

1:09:05.583 --> 1:09:08.500
Look, before you-- before--
before this gets out of hand,

1:09:08.583 --> 1:09:11.250
I want to say something.
I want to say that I'm sorry.

1:09:11.333 --> 1:09:12.291
Okay?

1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:14.708
I want to say that I'm sorry
about the other--

1:09:14.791 --> 1:09:16.750
Well, you know, I was...

1:09:18.166 --> 1:09:19.625
I was way too hard on you.

1:09:20.125 --> 1:09:21.375
I was frustrated.

1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:24.791
I was frustrated
because I care about you...

1:09:25.625 --> 1:09:26.500
a lot.

1:09:27.750 --> 1:09:30.208
All of these people care about you.

1:09:30.375 --> 1:09:32.875
They showed up <i>for</i> you. Okay?

1:09:32.958 --> 1:09:36.000
So for once, you're gonna have to
deal with that, all right?

1:09:36.125 --> 1:09:37.625
What if I don't know how?

1:09:45.208 --> 1:09:46.500
Think of it as a gift.

1:09:49.208 --> 1:09:52.000
Okay? Think of it as a gift
that you're giving us

1:09:52.083 --> 1:09:53.500
by letting us help you.

1:10:00.750 --> 1:10:01.708
Amber.

1:10:11.166 --> 1:10:12.166
Trust us.

1:10:14.333 --> 1:10:15.708
We won't let you down.

1:10:43.083 --> 1:10:44.208
Just over here.

1:11:02.958 --> 1:11:03.958
Hi, Bobby.

1:11:05.208 --> 1:11:06.458
Hi, Bobby.

1:11:07.208 --> 1:11:09.208
Have a seat, the show's about to start.

1:11:11.833 --> 1:11:13.125
Where are you going to sit?

1:11:24.708 --> 1:11:26.041
Good evening, everyone,

1:11:26.125 --> 1:11:28.750
and welcome to
the "Save Bobby Big Boy" Variety Show!

1:11:33.708 --> 1:11:37.208
Now, we have some amazing acts
lined up for you tonight.

1:11:37.291 --> 1:11:41.416
But before we get to those,
I wanted to make a few opening remarks.

1:11:42.583 --> 1:11:43.666
As we all know,

1:11:43.750 --> 1:11:46.625
Amber Appleton puts together
this Variety Show every year

1:11:46.708 --> 1:11:48.916
to raise money
for various school causes.

1:11:49.250 --> 1:11:52.666
She's also helped the Drama Club
mount their productions,

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:55.750
has lobbied the school board
for better wheelchair access,

1:11:55.833 --> 1:12:00.125
and has made me countless
delicious fried-egg sandwiches.

1:12:03.291 --> 1:12:06.666
She teaches, she volunteers.

1:12:09.375 --> 1:12:10.208
She's...

1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:12.916
sorta like a rock star.

1:12:15.875 --> 1:12:19.041
Just by being here tonight,
she has helped me get over my...

1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:22.208
my massive, massive stage fright.

1:12:23.625 --> 1:12:26.458
Honestly, I don't know, maybe.
I still might throw up, we'll see.

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:29.708
Now...

1:12:30.625 --> 1:12:33.625
even though it's really tough
for her to admit,

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:35.750
Amber needs us.

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.750
Our goal tonight is to raise $8,000,

1:12:38.833 --> 1:12:42.583
so that her dog, Bobby Big Boy,
can get a life-saving operation.

1:12:43.291 --> 1:12:47.208
We have raised over $2,000
in ticket sales alone so far.

1:12:51.791 --> 1:12:54.375
So, please, get out your phones

1:12:54.458 --> 1:12:57.000
and tweet, Instagram,
Facebook, live stream,

1:12:57.083 --> 1:12:59.916
anything you can to help get the word out.

1:13:00.791 --> 1:13:03.500
So, let's get to our first act.

1:13:07.083 --> 1:13:08.791
Whoo!

1:13:28.916 --> 1:13:30.833
Do you bite your thumb at me, sir.

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.166
I do bite my thumb, sir.

1:13:33.250 --> 1:13:35.166
Do you bite your thumb at <i>me, </i>sir?

1:13:45.166 --> 1:13:46.000
No, sir.

1:13:46.083 --> 1:13:49.458
I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
but I do bite my thumb, sir.

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.875
-Do you quarrel, sir?
-Quarrel, sir?

1:14:18.833 --> 1:14:19.958
Draw, if you be men.

1:14:26.750 --> 1:14:28.250
Yes, Jordan!

1:14:33.208 --> 1:14:36.125
All right, let's refresh our page
and see where we are.

1:14:37.333 --> 1:14:38.666
Yes, we're getting there.

1:14:38.750 --> 1:14:41.791
-Please, keep spreading the word.

1:14:41.875 --> 1:14:44.166
Next up, we have the punniest man alive.

1:14:44.250 --> 1:14:47.458
Give it up for Ricky Lingo Starr Roberts!

1:14:56.291 --> 1:14:59.875
I'm here to talk to you
about man's best friend.

1:15:01.458 --> 1:15:04.208
Well, one man's best friend.

1:15:04.625 --> 1:15:05.500
Mine.

1:15:06.041 --> 1:15:08.291
She's a human woman. Not a dog...

1:15:09.583 --> 1:15:12.250
but she's got a great one
in Bobby Big Boy.

1:15:13.291 --> 1:15:15.208
Things lately,

1:15:15.291 --> 1:15:17.500
they got a little <i>ruff</i> for these two,

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:21.625
but we're here to give
triple-B a new <i>leash</i> on life.

1:15:23.458 --> 1:15:26.791
I can say <i>Lapso-</i>lutely
amazing things about Amber,

1:15:26.875 --> 1:15:29.333
but you all might <i>Terrier</i> your hair out.

1:15:30.791 --> 1:15:33.208
And I don't want Amber to sit there

1:15:33.291 --> 1:15:36.750
and <i>Rottweiler</i> friends <i>Schnauzer</i> off
in front of everyone.

1:15:37.541 --> 1:15:39.541
So embarrassed of all the <i>Shih Tzu</i> here,

1:15:39.625 --> 1:15:42.916
that she <i>Pekingese </i>eyes out
from behind her hands.

1:15:45.041 --> 1:15:49.375
I'll keep things <i>Pug</i>-ressing
for a <i>Spaniel </i>be able to handle,

1:15:49.458 --> 1:15:50.708
and then <i>Retriever.</i>

1:15:53.125 --> 1:15:54.000
Amber...

1:15:54.541 --> 1:15:57.583
you <i>Mastiff</i> known
I would take this speech,

1:15:57.875 --> 1:16:02.083
and <i>Basset</i> on the fact
that you're a <i>Great Dane...</i>

1:16:03.750 --> 1:16:05.666
and my best friend
in the whole world.

1:16:05.750 --> 1:16:07.000
Aww...

1:16:08.083 --> 1:16:08.958
Thank you.

1:16:13.875 --> 1:16:16.416
All right, let's take another look
at where we are.

1:16:18.291 --> 1:16:22.083
Almost $6,000. Yes.

1:16:23.708 --> 1:16:25.750
Let's keep those pledges coming in.

1:16:28.791 --> 1:16:32.375
And now, for our last act of the night,

1:16:32.458 --> 1:16:34.791
ladies and gentlemen, the Korean Divas,

1:16:34.875 --> 1:16:38.000
accompanied by our very own
McKinley High marching band,

1:16:38.083 --> 1:16:40.041
and their brand new tuba.

1:16:40.333 --> 1:16:41.458

I don't know.

1:17:21.541 --> 1:17:23.666

Ladies and gentlemen, The Korean Divas
and the McKinley High Marching Band!

1:18:18.833 --> 1:18:21.041
Okay, let's take another look.

1:18:25.166 --> 1:18:28.458
Six thousand,
three hundred and four dollars.

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:29.500
Wow.

1:18:30.333 --> 1:18:33.416
I'd like to thank all the acts,
everybody who contributed.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:36.500
It's been an awesome night.
Thank you so, so much.

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:39.666
Now, we didn't quite make our goal,
but we'll keep the page open.

1:18:39.750 --> 1:18:41.833
So please keep spreading the word.

1:18:44.166 --> 1:18:45.166
No.

1:18:45.750 --> 1:18:49.000
Everybody, our guest of honor,
Amber Appleton!

1:19:03.875 --> 1:19:05.166
Wow. Uh...

1:19:06.958 --> 1:19:08.791
This is overwhelming. I'm not...

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:11.708
a hundred percent sure
this is happening yet.

1:19:12.125 --> 1:19:13.500
- Whoo!
- Um...

1:19:14.333 --> 1:19:17.291
But I'm so happy that
the marching band got their tuba.

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:28.958
<i>Hope is the thing with feathers.</i>

1:19:31.875 --> 1:19:33.166
My mom loved that poem.

1:19:36.833 --> 1:19:38.791
We'd read it at bedtime for...

1:19:40.666 --> 1:19:42.083
as long as I can remember.

1:19:45.208 --> 1:19:46.541
It's about finding hope,

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.875
even in the darkest of times.

1:19:54.166 --> 1:19:55.500
My mom always had hope,

1:19:57.875 --> 1:19:58.750
and so did I.

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:02.791
Until I lost it.

1:20:05.583 --> 1:20:07.458
But you all helped me find it again.

1:20:11.083 --> 1:20:12.750
I don't know how to repay you.

1:20:16.291 --> 1:20:17.833
But I guess that's the point.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.333
I don't have to repay you.

1:20:22.583 --> 1:20:25.458
I just have to take
the gift that you've given me

1:20:25.583 --> 1:20:26.500
and use it.

1:20:30.083 --> 1:20:31.125
And I will.

1:20:33.750 --> 1:20:34.958
So, thank you.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:37.458
I'm so grateful.

1:20:45.916 --> 1:20:47.875
Should we take one last look at our total?

1:20:47.958 --> 1:20:49.083
Yeah!

1:20:49.166 --> 1:20:50.125
Whoo-hoo! Do it!

1:20:57.791 --> 1:20:58.708
Is this a joke?

1:21:01.041 --> 1:21:04.208
Um, can we get a refresh on that, please?

1:21:15.583 --> 1:21:16.625
I think it's real.

1:21:17.250 --> 1:21:18.166
Ty, did you--

1:21:18.250 --> 1:21:19.083
No!

1:21:19.291 --> 1:21:21.041
No. I promise you, I had nothing...

1:21:21.708 --> 1:21:22.541
I don't know.

1:21:23.833 --> 1:21:24.708
Then...

1:21:30.958 --> 1:21:34.291
Looks like we got
an anonymous donation of $200,000,

1:21:34.375 --> 1:21:39.708
bringing our total to $206,844.

1:22:31.125 --> 1:22:32.166
Hi, Mr. Linder.

1:22:32.250 --> 1:22:34.125
It's me, Amber Appleton.

1:22:34.791 --> 1:22:35.750
Do you remember me?

1:22:36.875 --> 1:22:38.166
Are we related?

1:22:38.833 --> 1:22:40.916
No, I work here on the weekends,

1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.875
but I had some extra donuts,
so I thought I'd stop by.

1:22:44.208 --> 1:22:45.208
You want one?

1:22:47.541 --> 1:22:48.416
Hmm.

1:22:53.083 --> 1:22:54.166
What's this?

1:22:54.291 --> 1:22:55.875
Well, just open it.

1:23:01.916 --> 1:23:04.500
Oh, for God's sake, it's not a bomb.
Open it.

1:23:18.375 --> 1:23:20.083
Told you I'd make you cry.

1:23:25.166 --> 1:23:26.041
Joan...

1:23:28.625 --> 1:23:29.541
No.

1:23:31.458 --> 1:23:32.500
Yes.

1:23:34.166 --> 1:23:36.791
What am I supposed to do
with all that dough, huh?

1:23:37.291 --> 1:23:39.250
Line my coffin with it?

1:23:39.333 --> 1:23:41.125
I don't have any family left.

1:23:42.583 --> 1:23:44.333
Well, that's not exactly true.

1:23:46.416 --> 1:23:48.291
Actually, you're my family.

1:23:49.125 --> 1:23:52.083
And you can make better use of it
than anyone else I know.

1:23:55.708 --> 1:23:56.666
Oh...

1:23:58.583 --> 1:24:03.125
Oh, God, no. No more waterworks.
I only wanted to see it the one time.

1:24:03.583 --> 1:24:05.041
Well, I can't help that.

1:24:10.041 --> 1:24:11.041
Come here.

1:24:14.333 --> 1:24:15.333
Oh.

1:24:26.666 --> 1:24:28.125
Wake up, sweetie.

1:24:41.833 --> 1:24:42.875
Hey, Bobby.
