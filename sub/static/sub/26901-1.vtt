00:09.020 --> 00:14.210
In 1980 I was standing
in a radio and TV shop.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.090
An Italian immigrant. Flat broke.

00:18.380 --> 00:23.290
I'd just been evicted by a blonde
who found me on holiday in Rome.

00:23.580 --> 00:27.810
I was begging for a job when I saw them.

00:28.100 --> 00:33.250
Fat, shiny boxes with animated covers.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.690
VHS tapes.

00:35.980 --> 00:40.610
A year later
I ran the best video store in Sweden.

00:40.900 --> 00:45.450
This is 2017. A completely
different world.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.580 --> 01:39.810
shit.

01:44.420 --> 01:47.690
- shall we watch a movie tonight?
- OK.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.490
Why are you dressing like it's the 80's?

01:50.780 --> 01:55.370
I was looking at old photos
and realized I was gorgeous

01:55.660 --> 01:58.770
before I met your damn dad.

02:15.460 --> 02:19.050
I've got two black VTC for you.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.530
I don't collect distributors anymore.

02:22.820 --> 02:26.530
OK. What do you collect?

02:26.820 --> 02:29.690
Czech movies from the 60's.

03:17.540 --> 03:20.530
- You can’t sell this for ten kronor.
- Let's say five.

03:20.820 --> 03:23.810
It’s an ex rental in a fat box
in good condition.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.330
You can get 200 for this. At least.

03:37.620 --> 03:40.610
How about a video marathon?

03:42.980 --> 03:47.850
- I thought the theme was Giallo.
- It is.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.530
Why have you brought this Ewa Aulin-movie?

03:50.820 --> 03:53.730
It’s a Giallo.

04:28.020 --> 04:31.810
- Are you sleeping?
- No, I'm not sleeping.

04:32.100 --> 04:36.210
- what was the murder weapon?
- A razor.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.730
You're asleep when we're watching a movie.

04:41.020 --> 04:43.650
What’s with the distance
between the couch and the TV?

04:50.060 --> 04:51.370
Hi!

04:54.340 --> 04:59.690
Simone, I've got a translation
that needs to be delivered ASAP.

05:01.260 --> 05:06.650
How long will that take?
I'm seeing my daughter.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.130
Maybe an hour. Two for you.

05:11.820 --> 05:13.250
I'll do it.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.730
Yes!

05:28.180 --> 05:31.610
I haven't gone deaf since last time.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.690
Shoes.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.690
Where are the bills?

05:59.700 --> 06:03.490
I'll be evicted from the basement
in three weeks and two days.

06:05.340 --> 06:09.930
- I can't lend you any more money.
- I know, I know.

06:14.260 --> 06:17.610
Shouldn't the bus company
pay for your new drivers license?

06:17.900 --> 06:21.170
Yeah right. Can't you do it?

06:23.260 --> 06:26.210
I wasn't the one driving a bus drunk.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.890
Hungover. There's a massive difference.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.570
I was just gonna reverse it.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.970
There was something wrong with the bus.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.210
I want to open a new video store.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.850
For connoisseurs.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.850
For fuck's sake, Ennio.

06:51.140 --> 06:55.130
You can't let your manic hobby
ruin your life again.

06:55.420 --> 06:59.290
What do you mean by "ruin"?
It was the best video store in town.

06:59.580 --> 07:03.050
That was 20 years ago.
No one rents videos anymore.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.810
The sale of vinyl records is on the rise.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.570
My basement is a time machine.

07:10.860 --> 07:13.930
Some people would pay a lot for a visit.

07:14.220 --> 07:17.490
Tell that to the Enforcement Authority.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.770
To be an expert on VHS, what is...

07:23.060 --> 07:26.330
It's like knowing the phone book
by heart or something.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.890
What about you?
What makes you so fucking special?

07:31.180 --> 07:32.890
Anyone can do your job.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.850
Anyone can live your life.

07:58.780 --> 08:05.330
Skunk. You got the movie two weeks ago,
and you haven't paid yet.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.010
You haven’t even called me.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.050
She's got half an hour.
You can get a massage.

08:14.340 --> 08:16.010
Free of charge.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.370
I don't want a fucking massage.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.290
40 kronor times 14 is serious cash.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.130
- Give me the money.
- I don't have any money.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.650
- I might be a few hours late.
- I'll go see dad instead.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.970
When are we gonna have a video night?

08:34.260 --> 08:38.169
Simone, we're leaving now.

08:38.460 --> 08:42.010
Remember to set the alarm
and turn off the coffee machine.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.450
Turn the lights off and lock up.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.730
Hello?

08:59.140 --> 09:01.130
Hello? Kristin?

09:29.580 --> 09:32.890
Dirty old man. Christ.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.610
Hi, it's Simone.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.570
Hi. I called you about those video tapes.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.610
- Great.
- Yes.

10:08.060 --> 10:11.570
- How much do you want for this?
- I want to get rid of the entire box.

10:12.700 --> 10:13.610
Every...

10:15.500 --> 10:17.170
How about 100 kronor?

10:17.460 --> 10:21.610
- For this one?
- For the entire box.

10:21.900 --> 10:25.490
- I only want this one.
- You’ll have to take the entire box.

10:25.780 --> 10:30.890
I went up to get it.
I can't keep lugging it up and down.

10:31.180 --> 10:33.090
OK. I'll take it.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.690
These are so hard to come by.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.890
26 tapes.
The complete Video Invest collection.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.290
Isn't it 27 tapes?

10:48.580 --> 10:52.410
You need 27
to have the complete collection.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.650
It's complete. Except for ten porn movies.

10:59.940 --> 11:02.210
I know. Fucking idiot.

11:05.660 --> 11:08.410
When was the last time you bought a movie?

11:08.700 --> 11:10.570
- I have to go.
- You just got here.

11:10.860 --> 11:14.610
I'm working on the housewarming party.
Will you be there?

11:14.900 --> 11:16.730
I'll be there.

11:17.020 --> 11:20.410
Try not to overdo it.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.770
What do you mean?

11:25.140 --> 11:28.370
It's not a party party.

11:28.660 --> 11:32.050
- Do you get what I'm saying?
- Is Lena away?

11:34.460 --> 11:38.490
- No. Why?
- I see you've dressed yourself.

11:40.340 --> 11:42.770
- Loser.
- Fucking nerd.

12:23.900 --> 12:28.050
You want to see me fuck the gear stick?

13:24.780 --> 13:29.290
- Hello?
- Hello? Is this Ennio?

13:29.580 --> 13:32.290
- Yes.
- I’m Faceless.

13:34.260 --> 13:40.530
- I thought you were a man.
- I get that a lot.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.730
I heard you got "zombie"
released on video Invest.

13:46.340 --> 13:50.850
- well, yes...
- Is that in mint condition?

13:51.140 --> 13:54.210
Yes, absolutely. But it's not for sale.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.290
I'll give you 10000 Euros for it.

13:59.660 --> 14:03.090
- Then you can buy it.
- Great.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.050
When can I pick it up?
I want to see it with my own eyes.

14:07.340 --> 14:12.130
As soon as possible, I guess.

14:13.180 --> 14:17.770
Sweet. I'll see you in four days then.

14:18.060 --> 14:21.730
- OK.
- Cool. Thank you.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.730
Thank you.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.010
Yes!

14:39.820 --> 14:41.490
Fuck.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.770
I'm coming to get you, Ennio.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.410
Do you want any more chips?

16:31.220 --> 16:35.890
The only thing I miss about my ex
is coffee in bed.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.810
- what the fuck?
- So I bought a timer for the coffee maker.

16:43.060 --> 16:46.570
I swapped the guy for a timer.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.970
Hello!

16:56.260 --> 16:59.490
What the fuck is this?

16:59.780 --> 17:04.010
Stop it! what the...

17:05.660 --> 17:08.290
What the fuck.

17:38.460 --> 17:43.610
- Hi. Are you Enyo?
- Ennio.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.050
I promised my boyfriend to return this.

17:47.340 --> 17:51.610
It's damaged.
It's been soaking wet and then dried off.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.170
That's why it was in a bag.
To protect the movie.

17:54.460 --> 17:56.690
When the case is wet, it gets on the insert

17:56.980 --> 17:59.010
and I have to press it
between phone books.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.370
When it dries on its own,
it gets discolored.

18:04.820 --> 18:08.410
- Are you sick?
- Don't you understand?

18:08.700 --> 18:12.490
This is very valuable.
It's worth more than your damn jacket.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.410
Fucking old git.

18:14.700 --> 18:20.210
Tell him I want 1000 kronor
by the end of the week, or else.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.450
VIDEO RETAILER OF THE YEAR 1989

19:14.300 --> 19:18.970
Hey! Are you gonna open
another rental shop?

19:19.260 --> 19:22.170
Yes, but it's not ready yet.

19:25.580 --> 19:32.250
Shit. You’re insane.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.290
You've built the entire shop in here.

19:37.580 --> 19:43.370
This is a fucking museum.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.930
This is a cultural heritage.

19:48.220 --> 19:52.330
May I rent some of them? I'll pay double.

19:55.020 --> 19:57.530
Which one did you want?

19:57.820 --> 20:01.610
Which ones do I want?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.810
- Do you have ID?
- Yes.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.330
- Do you have "Girl hunter"?
- Of course.

20:07.620 --> 20:08.490
- Do you?
- Yes.

20:09.460 --> 20:12.810
Have you got
the same VHS player as last time?

20:13.100 --> 20:16.850
Of course. It’s Panasonic.
It lasts forever.

20:17.140 --> 20:19.370
- Have you cleaned it?
- what do you mean?

20:19.660 --> 20:22.530
Last time it chewed a tape.

20:22.820 --> 20:26.050
There was damage on the tape,
causing disruption to the image.

20:26.340 --> 20:29.970
- How do you know it was my VHS player?
- I wrote it down.

20:30.260 --> 20:34.090
The image is perfect at home.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.890
A damaged machine is tricky.

20:37.180 --> 20:42.330
It can play a couple of tapes perfectly,
then chew one, and so on.

20:44.060 --> 20:47.370
OK. What do you want for the movie?

20:47.660 --> 20:50.890
I can't give you the movie
until you've cleaned the player.

20:52.500 --> 20:57.090
Here's the number for a good repairman.

21:00.060 --> 21:05.730
Are you seriously saying
that I can't rent "Girl hunter" today?

21:06.020 --> 21:07.530
Yes.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.130
OK!

21:12.820 --> 21:16.450
Do you know what car I'm driving as well?

21:30.740 --> 21:32.890
welcome to the Enforcement Authority.

21:33.180 --> 21:36.970
We will answer your call
as soon as possible.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.970
Fucking idiots.

22:22.900 --> 22:27.490
Not a single... fucking like.

22:28.460 --> 22:32.490
People are so fucking boring.

23:07.900 --> 23:11.210
Ennio. E-N-N-I-O.

23:11.500 --> 23:17.250
- Like Morricone.
- Morricone with CK?

23:17.540 --> 23:23.210
No, Midena. Ennio Midena. That's my name.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.330
- I found you.
- Good.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.730
You spoke with my colleague yesterday.

23:29.020 --> 23:30.170
According to her you said

23:30.460 --> 23:34.930
We can shove your entire debts
up the Enforcement Authority's ass.

23:36.420 --> 23:41.650
What I meant was that I can pay off
all my debts, including the interest.

25:02.980 --> 25:06.170
I had some whiskey. Help yourselves.

25:13.100 --> 25:18.690
- Have you talked to Elsa? The one in pink.
- No.

25:19.940 --> 25:23.090
She's really nice and single.
we could do couples dinners.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.290
- “zombie”.
- Come help me in the kitchen.

25:25.580 --> 25:28.610
- Yes, of course.
- Are you eating cake?

25:28.900 --> 25:30.170
No, I’m not.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.890
Fuck, I spilled it.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.370
- who made “The Grande Bouffe” then?
- Marco Ferreri.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.810
He made "Dillinger is dead".

25:39.100 --> 25:42.730
They're great movies
with a lot of intensity.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.490
Well...

25:56.540 --> 25:59.690
Do you think Giallo-Bosse
will have time for me?

25:59.980 --> 26:05.410
Maybe he's outgrown nude photos
and violent movies.

26:05.700 --> 26:10.210
- So he doesn’t want to talk to me?
- No.

26:10.500 --> 26:14.130
To betray your ideals is not growing up.

26:14.420 --> 26:16.890
Cohabiting isn't a fucking rehab.

26:17.180 --> 26:21.450
That's easy to say when you're alone in a
basement and never have to compromise.

26:21.740 --> 26:25.250
Not even a single movie poster
on the walls.

26:25.540 --> 26:29.490
That's not compromise, that's fascism.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.930
Damn. Bitch.

26:38.100 --> 26:42.530
Bosse, listen.
Throw your fucking buddy out of here.

26:42.820 --> 26:49.370
we haven't had a single movie night
since you met that fucking witch.

26:49.660 --> 26:54.570
I know. But we're moving.
There’s a lot to...

26:54.860 --> 26:57.930
- Did you speak to Elsa?
- No.

26:59.820 --> 27:03.090
"zombie" is missing.
Do you get it?

27:04.300 --> 27:06.810
- what did you say?
- Someone took my fucking movie.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.210
Did you tell anyone that I found "zombie"?

27:10.500 --> 27:14.810
I may have told Oskar with a k.

27:16.060 --> 27:19.210
Oskar with a k? Are you fucking stupid?

27:19.500 --> 27:23.170
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- You have to go home.

27:25.180 --> 27:29.930
You're pussy whipped. Fucking traitor.

27:43.380 --> 27:46.250
You stink of liquor.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.850
Oskar with a k.

28:01.140 --> 28:05.650
Movie night?

28:31.620 --> 28:36.570
- Hello there.
- Simone, right?

28:42.540 --> 28:44.570
Hi.

28:44.860 --> 28:49.290
- Do you want to come to an after party?
- Yes.

28:57.100 --> 29:00.130
- Ennio.
- It’s Italian.

29:00.420 --> 29:05.010
- As in Ennio Morricone.
- Who’s that?

29:07.020 --> 29:11.530
- Don't you know who Ennio Morricone is?
- No.

29:15.620 --> 29:19.410
- Italian disco.
- Italian for you, mister.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.450
And 80’s music for me.

29:23.700 --> 29:28.250
- Are you a nostalgic?
- Yes. You better believe it.

29:29.620 --> 29:34.090
I feel like King Kong in New York. I
should have been extinct a long time ago.

29:34.380 --> 29:38.290
Who wants to be an average Joe?

29:38.580 --> 29:43.170
If you drink, you're weird.
And if you don't drink, you're also weird.

29:43.460 --> 29:47.690
Everyone's supposed to fit in.
Everyone's supposed to be average.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.850
I hate that word.

29:51.140 --> 29:55.410
I couldn't have put it better myself.
Fucking naming and shaming.

29:55.700 --> 29:59.690
You're not allowed to fail. You're supposed
to be so fucking proper all the time.

29:59.980 --> 30:05.850
Soon they'll all run around like Chinese
bicycle soldiers in kindergarten vests.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.370
You can only be different if you're rich.

30:08.660 --> 30:12.450
Bicycle vests.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.810
People are idiots.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.010
You can't say that.

30:20.300 --> 30:24.730
You look like the girls
in the movies I watch.

30:27.420 --> 30:32.730
- What kinds of movies?
- Italian horrors from the 70’s and 80’s.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.290
May I take a picture of you and me?

30:37.540 --> 30:42.130
Let’s see if I can find
that little gadget.

30:47.100 --> 30:52.610
- What's your Instagram handle?
- I'm not on Instagram.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.890
- What about Facebook?
- I’m not on there either.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.610
If I was a fucking attention whore

31:00.900 --> 31:06.410
I wouldn't put my life on the Internet
for everyone to see.

31:12.020 --> 31:18.130
- Are you a negative person?
- No, I'm a positive person. Definitely.

31:19.380 --> 31:20.770
Who's disappointed a lot.

32:20.260 --> 32:23.210
Did you find "zombie"?

32:28.140 --> 32:32.730
Found it.

33:41.420 --> 33:45.010
Shit. Someone spilled something.

33:59.260 --> 34:01.570
Good morning, Oskar.

34:04.580 --> 34:09.530
- Let's see what you've got to offer.
- Have you got a glass?

34:11.420 --> 34:14.210
Check in the kitchen.

34:26.179 --> 34:28.409
- Are they all VHS tapes?
- Of course.

34:33.020 --> 34:36.290
I don't watch VHS tapes anymore.

34:37.620 --> 34:40.969
The quality is too bad on the screen.

34:42.260 --> 34:44.850
Don't you collect VHS tapes anymore?

34:45.139 --> 34:50.010
Of course I collect.
I just don't watch them anymore.

34:52.260 --> 34:56.050
You'll have to provide the eye candy then.

35:05.740 --> 35:10.770
Here. I'm gonna fucking blow your mind.

35:11.060 --> 35:16.370
Marcus. Excuse me.

35:16.660 --> 35:22.090
I'm gonna need to take
some compensatory leave next week.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.930
Well...

35:25.220 --> 35:28.410
Next week is a bit inconvenient.

35:30.740 --> 35:36.530
If I... give too early notice,

35:36.820 --> 35:39.210
you don't know that far in advance.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.650
This isn't a supermarket, is it?

36:02.140 --> 36:07.730
I promise it's Rosalba Neri.
She'd never approve of a body double.

36:10.500 --> 36:14.770
Check this out. This chick has a scar here.

36:15.060 --> 36:17.770
- Probably from an appendectomy.
- OK, OK.

36:18.060 --> 36:21.130
Let’s check out the hardcore insert.

36:24.340 --> 36:25.490
There.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.050
The woman in the closeup hasn't got a scar.

36:29.340 --> 36:33.170
- Do you see it?
- Yes, I see it.

36:33.460 --> 36:39.370
So it’s not Rosalba Neri
who's fingering herself.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.250
It is on the Greek tape.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.330
But it hasn't got any hardcore inserts.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.650
I don't give a fuck about Rosalba Neri.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.090
I’ve never liked her.
You’re the one who collects Neri.

36:51.380 --> 36:54.490
Come back when you've got
a complete Anita Strindberg.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.090
And I'm not talking about DVD and Blu-ray.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.890
That's like saying
Fulci is better than Argento.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.450
- And he is.
- What?

37:03.740 --> 37:08.090
Fulci has made costume dramas,
sex comedies,

37:08.380 --> 37:13.890
westerns, action movies, zombie movies.
He’s done it all!

37:14.180 --> 37:19.330
Argento makes the same movie over
and over. All he does is Giallo movies.

37:19.620 --> 37:23.770
- So "Suspiria" is a Giallo?
- Yes, it is.

37:24.060 --> 37:28.850
The only difference is that the killer
is a witch and not a psychopath.

37:29.140 --> 37:33.850
I give up.
You never admit when you're wrong.

37:34.140 --> 37:37.530
Last week you dissed Fulci
in front of Bosse.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.610
That was compared to Bazzoni.

37:39.900 --> 37:44.690
Compared to him, all other Italian
directors are crap. Even Fellini.

37:45.740 --> 37:50.610
We're sitting too close.
Why is the sofa so close to the screen?

37:50.900 --> 37:54.610
- It's like sitting in a...
- Stop it. The distance is fine.

37:54.900 --> 37:58.530
- How far away is it?
- I don, t know.

37:58.820 --> 38:02.170
If you've got a 90 inch, you have
to be four meters from the screen.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.170
That way you can see the whole screen.

38:04.460 --> 38:09.370
If not, you'll have to move your eyes
like a fucking hummingbird.

38:10.540 --> 38:13.890
Check this out. One, two, three.

38:14.180 --> 38:17.810
Sit down, you fucking idiot!

38:20.020 --> 38:23.210
You can only see 77% of your 90 inch.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.650
What a fucking waste, Oskar.

38:26.940 --> 38:30.450
- You're not drinking much.
- Shut up.

38:32.020 --> 38:32.970
Cheers.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.170
Hi.

38:55.820 --> 38:58.570
Don't let Mr. Turtleneck push you around.

38:58.860 --> 39:02.890
He only got the job because of his dad.

39:06.860 --> 39:11.210
- Are you having lunch?
- No, I'm fasting.

39:11.500 --> 39:17.130
- I'm on the 5:2 diet.
- So am I.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.570
We can have an ice tea.

39:21.860 --> 39:26.130
I've got something to do.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.530
Let's do it some other time.

39:49.100 --> 39:53.050
I'm a little bit dizzy.

39:53.340 --> 39:56.810
- Are you a lightweight?
- Shut up.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.410
There you go.

41:29.140 --> 41:30.570
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.610
I live in the apartment below.

41:34.900 --> 41:38.450
- Do you recognize me?
- Yes. I'm not that old.

41:40.860 --> 41:44.810
I'm having a girls night in tonight.

41:45.100 --> 41:49.170
- But I've bought too much wine.
- Too much?

41:50.580 --> 41:52.810
- Yes.
- OK.

41:53.100 --> 41:57.130
I was wondering if you
could keep this for me.

41:57.420 --> 42:02.170
- I don't have a lot of room.
- Is that so?

42:02.460 --> 42:05.690
- I can do that.
- Can you?

42:05.980 --> 42:09.170
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

42:09.460 --> 42:14.610
- Hi, sweetie.
- Would you mind if we reschedule?

42:18.500 --> 42:20.690
Why?

42:20.980 --> 42:25.810
Dad can get me into a club
where I want to DJ.

42:31.260 --> 42:34.930
That's OK. We can do it some other time.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.610
- That's great.
- Bye. Kiss.

42:52.140 --> 42:54.930
- I have miscalculated.
- OK.

42:55.220 --> 42:59.210
- Can I have my wine back?
- I've drank it all.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.490
You can't do that.

43:05.140 --> 43:07.250
I'm joking.

43:17.540 --> 43:20.050
- Hi, Ennio.
- Hi.

43:20.340 --> 43:22.770
- What's up?
- No, it's OK.

43:23.060 --> 43:27.610
I was wondering if we could make the deal
one week later?

43:27.900 --> 43:30.450
- No.
- No?

43:30.740 --> 43:36.650
- No.
- You see, I have some things to do...

43:36.940 --> 43:42.210
- Is there a problem with the film?
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

43:42.500 --> 43:46.290
- See you the day after tomorrow then.
- OK.

43:48.020 --> 43:52.530
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Son of a bitch.

44:16.420 --> 44:19.810
- Maintainance.
- Is it the janitor at Elm Street?

44:20.100 --> 44:22.970
- Yes, that's right.
- This is Jonas Karlsson in 7B.

44:23.260 --> 44:28.050
A guy's coming round
to tune my guitars tomorrow morning.

44:28.340 --> 44:32.970
My keys are at my girlfriend's.
Could you open the door for him?

44:36.820 --> 44:39.130
Simone:
Do you have a movie about ancient Egypt?

44:57.660 --> 44:59.810
They're only in Egypt
the first ten minutes,

45:00.100 --> 45:02.690
but it's the best one I've seen
about the pyramids?

45:02.980 --> 45:05.730
"Manhattan Baby".

45:06.020 --> 45:08.730
- This is a horror.
- It's a Fulci movie.

45:09.020 --> 45:11.610
80's for you, Italian for me.

45:13.900 --> 45:18.490
- Fuck. It's the wrong region.
- Oh no!

45:18.780 --> 45:22.210
Your DVD player can't play zone 1.

45:22.500 --> 45:26.490
- Fuck.
- Have you brought anything else?

45:28.380 --> 45:33.810
"Sphinx" with Lesley-Anne Down
and Frank Langella from '81.

45:34.100 --> 45:37.530
It's a great movie, but it's on VHS.

45:37.820 --> 45:40.130
I don't have a VHS player.

45:40.420 --> 45:43.890
But I can watch it round yours some time.

45:44.180 --> 45:48.930
- "The Mummy" from '99?
- It's crap. Full of errors.

45:49.220 --> 45:55.330
Scarabs are dangerous in the movie,
but in ancient Egypt they're lucky charms.

45:58.580 --> 46:00.410
Oh, shit.

46:03.260 --> 46:07.930
- You're fucking cool.
- Why do you say that?

46:15.380 --> 46:20.450
You haven't asked what I do for work
or anything about my personal life.

46:23.140 --> 46:28.210
I'm more interested in the chemistry.

46:41.580 --> 46:43.490
I posted...

46:46.380 --> 46:50.370
I posted the pictures
I took of us on Instagram.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.850
Why?

46:53.140 --> 46:57.410
I wanted to show that I've got a life.

46:57.700 --> 47:03.610
I've got 200 followers,
but no one likes my photos.

47:04.500 --> 47:09.330
Now a days
attention is more quantity than quality.

47:09.620 --> 47:12.970
As long as I've got a place
where I'm not replaceable,

47:13.260 --> 47:15.410
I don't give a damn what people think.

47:18.060 --> 47:22.290
You want to be best for yourself.
Are you a Leo?

47:22.580 --> 47:26.850
Leo? Yeah, I am.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.570
I have to tell people about myself.

47:30.860 --> 47:36.450
No one ever asks me. On Facebook I can
talk about myself without anyone asking.

47:40.220 --> 47:42.330
Don't you have a family?

47:42.620 --> 47:46.850
They've always argued with my sister.
They never demanded anything from me.

47:47.140 --> 47:50.010
The first time I came home drunk

47:50.300 --> 47:53.730
my mom tried to hide it from my dad.

47:54.020 --> 48:00.050
Back then I thought it was great,
but now I think it's fucking sick.

48:14.820 --> 48:19.970
Hello. I have to get to work.
I'm super late.

48:21.020 --> 48:26.450
- I'm sorry. I have to run.
- That's OK. I have to go too.

48:26.740 --> 48:29.610
I've got a lot to...

48:42.060 --> 48:45.850
- Are you the guitar tuner?
- That's me.

48:48.700 --> 48:53.930
- I'll be waiting for you.
- OK, but it's gonna take a while.

48:54.220 --> 48:59.650
I can't just let strangers
into people's apartments.

48:59.940 --> 49:05.130
But everything's fine. It's best
if I can get some peace and quiet.

49:05.420 --> 49:09.850
Then you'll have to wait for me
to come back. You can't just leave.

49:32.380 --> 49:37.810
He's sorting them by directors.
This is fucking crazy.

52:18.180 --> 52:20.970
- Did you steal Ennio Midena's "zombie"?
- Help!

52:21.260 --> 52:24.090
- Did you steal Ennio Midena's "zombie"?
- What?

52:24.380 --> 52:28.130
- Have you got "zombie"?
- No!

52:42.260 --> 52:43.330
Hi.

52:45.540 --> 52:49.570
- You'll have to say something.
- It'll come out.

52:49.860 --> 52:53.010
But don't you see...

52:56.500 --> 53:00.890
Hi, this is Kristin.
I can't take your call right now.

53:18.100 --> 53:21.890
- Simone. Hi.
- Hi.

53:22.180 --> 53:26.010
- Are you upset?
- Yes, a little bit.

53:26.300 --> 53:29.130
What's up?

53:30.900 --> 53:37.810
I'm having a lot of feelings
I don't know how to handle.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.170
Christ!

53:40.220 --> 53:44.610
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK. But...

53:44.900 --> 53:46.330
I wish you were here now.

53:48.500 --> 53:51.010
Me too.

53:51.980 --> 53:56.170
I feel unfairly treated by my daughter.

53:56.460 --> 53:59.690
She's always prioritizing her dad.

53:59.980 --> 54:04.930
He shows up now, after I raised her.

54:05.220 --> 54:08.130
He's got a lot of money and contacts.

54:10.900 --> 54:14.410
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

54:14.700 --> 54:19.090
- Tell her.
- No, I can't.

54:19.380 --> 54:23.570
Of course you can. People should listen
to you. You talk a lot of sense.

54:23.860 --> 54:28.730
- Put your foot down.
- You're so sweet.

54:32.340 --> 54:33.730
I want you to be here now.

54:36.100 --> 54:41.770
Can I call you back?
I'm a little bit busy right now.

54:42.060 --> 54:46.170
- I'll call you.
- Talk to you later.

55:43.100 --> 55:48.090
- Bosse, are you there?
- Yes! What do you want?

55:48.380 --> 55:51.690
I'm in big fucking trouble.

55:53.100 --> 55:57.250
- Ennio...
- Do you know Faceless?

55:57.540 --> 55:59.930
Answer me!

56:01.500 --> 56:04.610
I have to tell you something.

56:06.180 --> 56:08.850
What the fuck are you doing?

56:20.500 --> 56:22.730
Come in.

56:29.300 --> 56:32.930
- What have you been up to today?
- Today... Eh...

56:37.060 --> 56:39.850
What do you do for a living?

56:40.140 --> 56:45.890
I managed one of Sweden's most talked
about video stores in the 80's and 90's.

56:48.340 --> 56:51.010
I want to open another one.

56:51.300 --> 56:54.010
Shit. That sounds niche.

56:59.580 --> 57:02.490
Do you have anything stronger than wine?

57:04.620 --> 57:07.170
Help yourself.

57:20.540 --> 57:23.050
Fuck. I want to get drunk.

57:23.340 --> 57:25.370
We're passionate people.

57:25.660 --> 57:28.290
You love movies
and I love Egypt and the 80's.

57:28.580 --> 57:34.770
That's why we're outsiders. Normal people
don't have time to be passionate.

57:36.140 --> 57:40.770
But for us it's all or nothing.

57:41.060 --> 57:43.570
Sometimes you hit the wall, but so what?

57:43.860 --> 57:50.170
In ancient Egypt they skipped the bad times
when they wrote down their history.

57:50.460 --> 57:54.730
I'm trying to do the same.
I only remember the fun parts.

57:59.140 --> 58:02.650
I've been fantasizing about you.

59:27.500 --> 59:30.290
It's nice to wake up in a bed for once.

59:35.460 --> 59:39.210
There hasn't been a man
in this bed in ages.

59:44.980 --> 59:47.850
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

59:53.140 --> 59:55.010
- What's up with you?
- Are you angry?

59:55.300 --> 59:57.010
No.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.770
- Don't go.
- I need the toilet.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:13.170
- Are all men the same?
- Absolutely not.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.490
- It feels like I could be anyone.
- No.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.730
That's what you said. "There hasn't been
a man here in ages."

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:26.330
- That's not what I meant.
- Where are my boxers?

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.610
Here.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.170
Do you have to be fully dressed
to go to the toilet?

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:45.370
Shit. My boss has liked
one of my Facebook posts.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.210
You're such an attention whore.

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:55.890
Is it extra important
because it's your boss?

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.610
What's your problem? Did you get up
on the wrong side of the bed?

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.850
No, I'm just tired of this crap.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.850
Status this and status that.
The digital plague.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.330
I thought it was us against the world.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.530
Can't it be us and the world?

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.650
You said we were special, passionate.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.890
That average is boring.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.090
Do we have to think
we're better than others?

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.370
You're so fucking PC.
It's because people are idiots.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:36.210
Why would certain people, you,
be better than others?

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:41.090
That's being an attention whore.
You're fixated on status.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.570
That's so fucking stupid.
Are you crazy?

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.050
OK, now I'm crazy.
He collect movies, he must be weird.

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.450
- I must have some kind of diagnosis.
- What's wrong with you?

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.530
Didn't you need the toilet?

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.650
Fuck!

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:08.530
17 missed calls

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:25.930
Hello?

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:07.210
- How about lunch tomorrow?
- Sure. That's fine.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:25.010
My best friend had a job like yours.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.010
With twice as many tasks.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:35.050
She's extremely upstanding.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.490
She'd never talk behind people's backs
at lunch.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.450
So she was ostracized.

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.330
One day the boss wanted to talk to her.
He said she was overly ambitions.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.570
Then she was fired.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.690
No! That's insane.

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.410
You're not very good at your job.

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.410
If we ask you to fix something,
you take way too long.

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.210
I want you to resign.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:18.170
Just do it. Now. This week.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.410
Then I'll shut up.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.970
I know what you're doing.

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.770
- Do you want dessert?
- Yes, please.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.450
- Wait!
- What are you doing there?

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:19.650
- I'm locked in. Help me out.
- Why would I do that?

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.130
- What happened to us?
- Video killed the radio star.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.890
I thought we had some great years.
Our camping holidays.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.770
The summer in Italy.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:43.810
You, me and mom in Venice
and the priest who told us to go to hell.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.970
"Heaven is crying for you.
You are heathens."

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.770
The one who got bird poo on his head.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.610
I forgot about that.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.210
I was the man of your dreams.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.010
I was number one.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.810
Isn't that right, Margareta?

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.010
Isn't that right?

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.810
I'm coming to get you, Ennio.

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:58.970
- Hello?
- It's Bosse. Open up!

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.810
- It's Bosse!
- There should be a bounty on your head.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.650
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Open up.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.770
Open up. We're selling "zombie".

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.090
Do you know Faceless?

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.930
No, I don't.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.290
But I told her about “zombie”.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.010
Maggan told me you were having
financial difficulties

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.609
and that debt collectors are after you.

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:43.130
Faceless pays a lot of money
for rare VHS tapes.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.450
- You don't stiff her.
- I didn't!

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.770
- Someone's stolen “zombie”.
- Stolen?

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:58.370
- But you said...
- I lied.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.890
What the hell now?

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.930
Ferox Johan.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.689
We'll buy "zombie" from Ferox Johan.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.970
- Why the fuck are we meeting here?
- He was going to an afterhours party.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.410
He feels threatened by you.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.010
So I said...

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.170
Pussy whipped.

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:07.170
What? Oh, shit...

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.730
Hello. Nice of you to call.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.890
- What the fuck did you post on Instagram?
- What?

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.650
- Check it, for fuck's sake.
- What did I post?

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.890
- Do you see it?
- That's disgusting.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.370
- That's right.
- I've never had more likes.

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.410
Delete it, or I'm cutting contact.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.930
I'll delete it immediately.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:38.770
Listen to me.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:47.370
I want you to come visit me tonight.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:51.970
- I can't.
- I don't give a shit if you can't.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:56.170
It's important.
Come see me, cause I need to talk to you.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.010
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:16.090
Can you take this?

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.610
Get help.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.810
- I'm so sorry.
- Do you have the film?

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:39.850
Yes, I have the film. But please.
I will only do this if you come alone.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:43.330
- Of course I'm coming alone.
- OK. Good.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.490
- Have you talked to Bosse?
- Who?

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:52.730
- Bosse.
- I don't know anybody named Bosse.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.570
See you tonight, Ennio.
Text me your address.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:13.210
- Hello, sweetie. Welcome.
- Thanks.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.850
I'm glad you came.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.650
You wanted to talk to me.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.130
- Why are you avoiding me?
- I'm not avoiding you.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:36.970
- You're prioritizing your dad over me.
- Yes.

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:48.370
I'm jealous
of your relationship with your dad.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:53.730
- Why don't you want to see me?
- Why do you think?

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:58.370
I haven't got a clue.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:03.130
Because of your drinking.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:06.850
You're an alcoholic, mom.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:11.810
The last few years before I moved out,
I found bottles hidden everywhere.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.570
Every time we talk on the phone,
you're drunk.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:16.530
Why didn't you say anything?

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.490
I was taught to sweep things under the rug.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.250
- I want to be your friend.
- I don't want a friend.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.250
I want a mother.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:35.090
After the divorce your dad moved in
to the flats opposite with that woman.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.130
I carried on as usual
and worked my ass off to support us.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:44.970
I made sure we went on holidays and that
you could go to your riding camps.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.850
I don't give a shit about the riding camps!

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.690
You were always drunk
when I came home from school!

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.250
I had to brush your teeth sometimes!

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.530
- He didn't care about you.
- Yes, he did.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.810
He didn't give a shit about you.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:09.890
He didn't show up until you turned 15.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:15.450
I never gave up. I never complained.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:23.570
Wine became my friend.
Wine became my dream

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:29.450
about something other than
my miserable reality.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.650
OK. Do you mean me?

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.250
I meant...

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.290
I love you. You're everything to me.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.330
I'm sorry.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.730
Where have you been?

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:15.410
I'm sorry, but I have to
go on sick leave for a few weeks.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.570
- We can't talk about it now. I'm busy.
- I can see that, but...

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.410
- Did you hear what he said?
- Yes, but this is urgent.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:28.250
I'm going to rehab, so I have to
go on sick leave starting tomorrow.

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:32.650
Don't worry. You don't have to pay for it.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.370
My well-to-do sister is taking care of it.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:42.570
- Are you drunk?
- Of course I am.

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:47.090
In a few days I'll be sober
for the rest of my life.

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:51.290
You can pack up your stuff and leave.

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:56.450
OK. Sure. Absolutely.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.570
- Seriously.
- Did she leave?

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.290
Log in or sign up

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:45.530
- Bloody goldmine in here.
- We don't have time for this.

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.210
What the fuck am I doing with this idiot?

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.290
Ennio. Is that Italian?

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.610
Like Morricone?

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.930
- I need more time.
- What am I doing with you?

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.490
What's going on here?

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.810
Why am I tied up? Where is my money?

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.530
- Your money is on the table.
- Why am I tied up?

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.810
I said: “Let's move on.”
He said: “I just want to have a look.”

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.250
He's like you. A manic fucking collector.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.690
I hate you fucking guys
obsessing over old shit.

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.970
You can't connect with people
so you try dead things instead?

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.090
Why does he have a mask?

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:24.130
Sometimes, Ennio, he has to do dodgy shit.

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.690
Some guys won't stick to a deal.

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.770
I need one more hour.
A small fucking hit.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.370
Five more minutes,
then we're gone.

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.970
Give me one fucking break!

01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:38.770
We have one more stop,
then you can OD for all I care.

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:42.410
- It's one in a million. I'm staying.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.530
Where is your friend?

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.930
He ran.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.330
- You remind me of my brother.
- Why?

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.410
He was a collector too.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.010
A manic depressive junkie.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.370
- Hang himself.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.330
Don't be.

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:20.890
His cop out makes me travel around Europe
completing the holes in his VHS collection.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.810
Why?

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.930
I want to give my niece a present
from her loser dad.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.730
That's nice.

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.410
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:54.290
- Hi, Ennio.
- Hi.

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.770
What are you up to?

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:04.490
- I'm watching “Cleopatra”.
- OK.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:10.210
- With Taylor?
- Yes. She's the best.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:16.290
- Yes. Of course.
- She's fucking gorgeous.

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.930
Listen...

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:26.050
I know I can be critical sometimes.

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.170
Yes, a bit.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:33.370
You were right.
I'm also an attention whore.

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.890
I always want to be the best,
but I know I'm not.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.090
Sometimes, when I realize
how insignificant I am,

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:44.610
I want to slaughter
everything and everyone.

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:49.530
But with you... I don't know.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.610
I'd rather bite my tongue.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.770
I haven't cared about someone else
in fucking ages.

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.690
I care about you too, Ennio.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:11.930
- OK.
- And I like listening to you.

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:15.130
Usually.

01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.970
I'm an alcoholic.

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:26.650
So what? I'm a know-it-all.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.010
Probably an alcoholic as well.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:35.810
You're the best at being the worst.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.810
I know.

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:45.970
I'm gonna change my life.

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:52.170
I'm not gonna mess about.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:58.010
I'm drinking wine for the last time in...

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:06.690
For the last time, hopefully.

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:12.050
Can we do something
about our lives together?

01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:18.890
I mean, some people build houses.

01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:23.250
We can build each other.

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:27.810
I wish you were here now, Ennio.

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:17.930
