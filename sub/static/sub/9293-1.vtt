00:16.360 --> 00:18.749
(man) America has been victimised again.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.072
Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio
was the latest in this series of bombings

00:23.160 --> 00:25.993
that began 11 weeks ago
in ten different cities.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.355
Over 900 have been killed thus far.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.637
While no one claims responsibility
for this wave of death,

00:31.720 --> 00:34.314
evidence points to Islamic militants.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.437
Here in Los Angeles,
the mood is tense and fearful.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.116
The Department of Homeland Security
urges all citizens to report without delay

00:42.200 --> 00:44.475
any suspicious persons or activities.

00:44.560 --> 00:48.838
A department spokesperson says,
"We don't want to start a witch-hunt,

00:48.920 --> 00:52.754
but we'd rather err on the side of caution
than become the next target."

00:52.840 --> 00:58.915
He said that the vigilance of the public
is our best line of defence against attack.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.468
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:01.560 --> 01:04.632
Stop, stop, stop. Open the doors.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.154
Please, I have to get to work.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.276
I'll be late for work.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.397
Please, open the door.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.836
Come on, man, open the door.

01:15.920 --> 01:20.675
Open the door! I can't believe you...
I can't believe you didn't open the door!

01:20.760 --> 01:24.435
I have as much right to be on the bus as you!

01:46.680 --> 01:47.908
(beep)

02:00.520 --> 02:05.310
Our country is under siege.
You're the National Security Advisor, Karen.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.311
I'm surprised by your resistance.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.598
These places you keep building
are nothing more than concentration camps.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.511
Detention facilities.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.718
The criteria for determining
who should be detained are very reasonable.

02:17.800 --> 02:23.591
This revised plan of yours justifies locking up
every American who prays towards Mecca.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.193
That's an exaggeration.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.511
The American Muslim
community is our greatest asset.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.239
They provided law enforcement
with hundreds of tips.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.880
Not one member
has been implicated in the attacks.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.871
So far.

02:35.960 --> 02:40.317
Mr President, the people are losing faith
in our ability to protect them.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.960
We've got to do something about this now.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.077
And locking up more Muslims
will not make them safer.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.958
No, Karen, but it will make them feel safer.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.157
What about the civil unrest
your plan will create?

02:52.240 --> 02:56.631
- There will be riots, demonstrations...
- Security has its price.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.438
So does freedom, Tom.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.512
I don't see how
I can sign off on something like this.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.071
Three months ago I took an oath to preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution.

03:07.160 --> 03:11.392
And what about preserving, protecting
and defending the American people?

03:11.480 --> 03:13.391
All of these measures are legal.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.756
Blake has been all over this
with the Attorney General.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.073
There is a precedent in wartime. Lincoln
suspended habeas corpus, Roosevelt...

03:22.160 --> 03:26.676
Yes, I know this. And Roosevelt imprisoned
over 200,000 Japanese Americans,

03:26.760 --> 03:29.797
in what most historians
consider to be a shameful mistake.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.429
I'd ask those historians
how many of those Japanese Americans

03:33.520 --> 03:37.911
were thus prevented from perpetrating
acts of sabotage in this country.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.197
I realise that what I'm proposing
has its challenges,

03:41.280 --> 03:45.592
but we cannot continue to keep
our heads buried in the sand.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.830
- Mr President.
- Yeah.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.520
- Another attack?
- Los Angeles, a bus.

03:53.520 --> 03:57.308
- How many casualties?
- 23 so far, including the suicide bomber.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.151
We're still certain this Assad
is behind these attacks?

04:12.240 --> 04:16.596
He arrived in the US three days
before the first bombing in San Antonio.

04:16.680 --> 04:22.676
Let us not forget Assad has been calling for
the destruction of the US for the last 20 years.

04:22.760 --> 04:27.197
Mr President, my analysts believe Assad's
organisation cannot survive without him,

04:27.280 --> 04:29.271
and once he's dead, the attacks will stop.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.070
So this assumes the success
of the operation to terminate Assad.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.550
CTU estimates successful probability at 75%.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.952
- I think that's very generous.
- It sounds like you're anticipating failure.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.874
I fully acknowledge, sir,
that this is our only option,

04:45.960 --> 04:50.158
but I am fervently advocating contingencies.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.711
Contingencies are well and good, Tom,
but CTU needs to eliminate Assad.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.155
That's all there is to it.

05:00.680 --> 05:04.150
God knows we're paying
a steep enough price to get him.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.435
I told you 20 times, don't send out
a report without a certified header.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.954
This makes 21.
You should update your count.

05:11.040 --> 05:15.636
Do you - I'm just curious - ever open your
mouth without sarcasm spilling out of it?

05:15.720 --> 05:18.757
- Are we done here?
- I'm just telling you to be careful,

05:18.840 --> 05:21.593
or you'll be back selling
ladies' shoes in Beverly Hills.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.478
You're settling well into middle management.

05:24.560 --> 05:28.599
- What's your problem with me?
- I liked you as an analyst. You were good.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.989
As a boss, bit of a bore.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.998
Right.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.196
What's going on?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.794
Talk to your boyfriend.
Guy's on self-destruct.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.234
You promised you'd get along with Milo.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.154
I'm sorry, darling,
that's a promise I just can't keep.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.039
Morris. Morris!

05:53.120 --> 05:56.510
I had the same problem with
department heads. I learned to fit in.

05:56.600 --> 06:01.515
- There's no reason why you can't.
- I don't happen to be a pretty lady.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.273
- What are you talking about?
- You're a hottie.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.352
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. Deal with it.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.793
- We're at work.
- So?

06:08.880 --> 06:11.997
- It's unprofessional.
- Are you saying you don't like it?

06:12.080 --> 06:17.234
No. I just came to see if you got a request
from Homeland on the priority channel.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.151
No.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.549
Why did they send it only to me?

06:21.640 --> 06:24.200
I don't know.

06:24.280 --> 06:28.159
- Just try to get along.
- Because you asked, I will.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.755
Nadia, I got a weird request from Homeland.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.037
They want to set up a channel.
I wanted to clear it with you.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.079
- You're cleared.
- They want it formatted to military specs.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.799
I'm coordinating an assault
with Cobra helicopters.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.314
- When?
- 30 minutes.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.472
- But assault on who?
- Assad.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.560
What? We don't know where Assad is.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.679
- We will. We have a lead.
- No. If we did, I'd know about it.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.309
- We found a way to get Assad's location.
- How?

07:03.280 --> 07:06.477
- Jack Bauer.
- Jack's in a Chinese prison.

07:06.960 --> 07:11.715
Not any more. President negotiated
his release two days ago.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.475
- Jack's coming back?
- Yes.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.348
Why did the Chinese let him go? Why today?
Does it have to do with the attacks?

07:19.440 --> 07:23.274
- How do we think he'll lead us to Assad?
- I can't talk about this yet.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.399
Why not? Can Bill Buchanan talk about it?

07:27.480 --> 07:30.199
He's meeting Jack
at Point Mugu Naval Air Station.

07:30.280 --> 07:35.035
Now open that military channel
and put it through to the conference area.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.875
The president must have
given up a lot to make this happen.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.112
I wish he were coming back
under different circumstances.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.554
We don't know what his state of mind will be.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.712
If he doesn't cooperate,
we need to be prepared.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.432
Mr Buchanan, I need your signature
on this release document.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.828
Take those cuffs off him.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.911
(speaks Chinese)

08:56.440 --> 08:58.317
Jack.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.437
It's OK. Come with me.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.070
Please convey to your president
that Mr Bauer never broke his silence.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.754
He hasn't spoken a word in nearly two years.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.599
Your president has paid
a high price for Mr Bauer's freedom.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.672
What he wants from him
must be very important.

09:46.560 --> 09:52.078
President Palmer wants to speak to you
himself as soon as we debrief.

09:54.640 --> 09:59.031
I'm sorry, Jack. How could you know?
Wayne Palmer is president.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.078
He's the one who negotiated your release.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.914
I can't even begin to imagine
what you went through over there.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.594
But there's a reason you're here now.

10:11.440 --> 10:16.719
The last 11 weeks, our cities have been
targeted by a series of terror attacks -

10:16.800 --> 10:19.360
buses, trains, shopping malls.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.911
The last one was 15 minutes ago
here in Los Angeles.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.915
It's Hamri Al-Assad.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.234
Assad's here, Jack.

10:31.080 --> 10:35.358
Four days ago,
one of Assad's men contacted us.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.238
He said he'd give up Assad for $25 million.

10:39.320 --> 10:43.199
But he's demanding something
more than money.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.748
He wants you, Jack.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.912
He wants you dead.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.911
It's Abu Fayed.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.708
He wants his pound of flesh
for what happened in Beirut.

11:02.800 --> 11:08.272
We offered him other alternatives.
We did everything we could think of, Jack.

11:08.360 --> 11:13.309
But he would only agree
to give us Assad in exchange for you.

11:13.400 --> 11:18.474
He's demanded our surveillance protocols,
which means we can't risk an extraction.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.235
Once he has you, you'll be on your own.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.189
You understand what this means, Jack?

11:25.280 --> 11:30.832
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself
so we can eliminate Assad.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.431
- (whispers) Audrey.
- I can't hear you, Jack.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.951
(clears throat)

11:41.960 --> 11:43.518
Audrey.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.989
Audrey doesn't know you're back.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.791
My daughter?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.950
Kim doesn't know either.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.229
You keep it that way.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.910
I know what's being asked of me, Curtis.
You don't need your firearm.

12:08.920 --> 12:14.153
Before we do this, I would like to clean up.

12:14.840 --> 12:19.709
We've got an area set up for you
and brought you some new clothes.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.874
(phone rings)

13:08.160 --> 13:09.354
Bill.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.749
- (Bill) We have Jack.
- Good.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.799
I thought I was prepared,
but he's worse than I expected, much worse.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.829
I know how hard this must be for you,

13:20.920 --> 13:24.276
but everything depends on this operation.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.476
I understand.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.154
I know you do.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.839
I wish I were there with you.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.798
You're where you need to be.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.356
I miss you.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.715
I miss you too.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.793
I have to take Jack to the drop point now. Bye.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.318
(man) LA has been added to the list
of major cities hit by terrorist attacks.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.075
The Department of Homeland Security
raised the threat level to red,

13:57.160 --> 13:59.628
the highest since the department was formed.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.269
FBI will handle the searches outside the city.
Focus on the main grid.

14:03.360 --> 14:07.672
- Nadia, I need to talk to you.
- Finish that up and check back with me.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.513
- Did you put the military channel through?
- Yeah.

14:10.600 --> 14:15.469
I tried to locate Bill or Curtis to find out about
Jack. There's a block on their status rosters.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.676
I told you, I can't talk about this.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.991
You've only been here a couple months
so you don't know me well.

14:21.080 --> 14:26.598
If you did, you'd know how much Jack Bauer
means to me. Sooner or later I will find out.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.830
- Tell me.
- I don't have authorisation...

14:28.920 --> 14:35.029
Why don't I call Division and tell them about
when you left the Jarvis firewall unsecured?

14:35.120 --> 14:38.829
If it weren't for me,
you would have been fired over that.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.670
We were contacted four days ago
by a man named Fayed.

14:46.760 --> 14:52.312
He offered to give us Assad's location for a
list of demands. One of them was Jack Bauer.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.631
- Jack? Why does he want Jack?
- Retribution.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.438
Retribution for what?

14:57.520 --> 15:01.195
Fayed's brother was in the cell
that bombed our embassy in Lebanon in 1999.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.113
Jack was sent to grab him
and get names of other members.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.158
Fayed's brother died
while Jack was interrogating him.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.630
- Now he wants Jack dead.
- That's right.

15:10.720 --> 15:15.396
And you're really gonnajust deliver Jack
over to the terrorist to be killed?

15:15.960 --> 15:17.678
- Nadia...
- We need to stop Assad.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.275
We can grab Jack
once Fayed gives us Assad's location.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.555
Fayed can detect our surveillance.

15:23.640 --> 15:29.795
We gave Fayed access to our satellite
coverage, radio frequencies and air corridors.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.758
He'll give us nothing
till he's free and clear with Jack.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.149
How do we even know
he'll do what he says?

15:35.240 --> 15:36.559
We don't.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.518
I'm calling Karen. She'll talk to the president.

15:42.600 --> 15:48.197
Don't you get it? Karen already knows.
So does President Palmer. He authorised it.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.750
Look.

15:58.840 --> 16:03.675
I'm sorry about your friend,
but there's nothing you, I or anyone can do.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.832
Right now, this is our only way
out of this crisis.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.277
If we want these attacks to stop,
Jack Bauer has to be sacrificed.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.474
(phone rings)

16:52.520 --> 16:55.478
- I only got half those upgrades.
- You'll get the rest.

16:55.560 --> 17:01.192
I needed them ten minutes ago. Don't expect
Chloe to keep running interference.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.919
- You'll get your upgrades.
- When?

17:09.079 --> 17:11.913
What's going on between you and Nadia?

17:12.000 --> 17:15.878
The president got Jack back
from the Chinese. He's in LA now.

17:15.960 --> 17:19.748
- Well, that's very good news.
- No, Morris, it's not.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.438
(phone rings)

17:28.520 --> 17:30.909
- Buchanan.
- It's the president. Is Jack with you?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.470
- Yes, sir. We're almost at the drop point.
- Let me speak to him.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.551
I'll put him on. Jack?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.356
Jack?

17:42.880 --> 17:46.509
It's President Palmer.
He wants to talk to you.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.318
Mr President.

17:53.400 --> 17:58.110
Jack, I've been trying to think
of what I could possibly say to you.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.113
After all you've sacrificed for this country,
what you've done for me in the past

18:02.200 --> 18:05.875
and, of course,
what you've done for my brother David.

18:05.960 --> 18:11.478
This is a desperate measure, Jack, I know,
but it's also a measure of our desperation.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.394
People are afraid to come outside,
afraid to leave their homes.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.789
They're turning against each other.

18:17.880 --> 18:22.192
Bill Buchanan explained the situation, sir.
I know what's happening.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.670
I understand what's expected of me.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.437
You have my word. My word, Jack.
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.990
Thank you.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.834
- God bless you, Jack.
- Goodbye, Mr President.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.556
When I agreed to run for this office,
I thought that I understood this job.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.918
I was right beside my brother David
when he had to make impossible decisions,

18:56.000 --> 19:02.314
times he had to choose between bad options,
but now that I'm the one sitting in that chair,

19:02.400 --> 19:06.313
I'm starting to wonder
if I'm the right person to lead this country.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.558
- It's an irrelevant question, sir.
- Excuse me?

19:11.640 --> 19:15.189
You will lead this country,
whether you want to or not.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.950
You are the president.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.432
This president can't shake the feeling
that sacrificing Jack Bauer is a mistake,

19:27.520 --> 19:30.557
and that maybe I should
call this off before it's too late.

19:30.640 --> 19:34.952
No, sir. You have not made a mistake.

19:35.040 --> 19:41.036
And, for what it's worth, your brother
would be doing just the same thing.

19:41.120 --> 19:45.716
- That doesn't make it right.
- It isn't right. It isn't wrong.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.792
It's simply our only option.

19:48.880 --> 19:54.034
Bauer has to be sacrificed
so this country can survive.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.910
- I just heard a disturbing rumour.
- Huh? What rumour's that?

20:09.000 --> 20:13.835
You're authorising detention facilities
at convention centres and sports arenas

20:13.920 --> 20:18.198
- in Los Angeles, Detroit and Philadelphia.
- Yeah, that's correct.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.511
That's against the president's order.
I was there.

20:21.600 --> 20:26.037
Karen, I know where you were.
I was standing right next to you.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.590
To my knowledge,
that order hasn't been rescinded.

20:29.680 --> 20:35.198
You are confused. I haven't implemented
anything yet. I'm merely positioning.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.795
If the president changes his mind,
as I suspect he will,

20:38.880 --> 20:41.474
then we will have wasted less time.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.597
I'm not confused.
You can use whatever words you like.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.116
In plain English,
you're second-guessing the president.

20:48.200 --> 20:52.034
Plain English does not allow
for the nuances my job requires.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.553
How far will you push this?

20:53.640 --> 20:58.111
The ACLU is filing complaints that
we gave the bureau too much field authority.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.716
They have not been given near enough.
They need a wider net with tighter mesh.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.473
And when innocent people
get caught in that net?

21:05.560 --> 21:10.588
Well, like I told you before, security
has its price. Just get used to it, Karen.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.991
(phone rings)

21:23.400 --> 21:27.757
- Go ahead.
- Secure Bauer's wrist to the grate and leave.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.435
- First tell me where Assad is.
- This isn't a negotiation.

21:31.520 --> 21:36.310
If you want Assad, leave Bauer here,
get back in your car and drive away.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.197
I'm watching you.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.157
You listen to me, you son of a bitch...

21:46.320 --> 21:49.392
He wants me to handcuff you to that grate.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.512
Do it.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.158
I don't know what to say, Jack.

22:12.680 --> 22:19.233
Do you understand the difference between
dying for something and dying for nothing?

22:19.320 --> 22:24.917
The only reason I fought to stay alive in China
was because I didn't want to die for nothing.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.157
Today...

22:30.800 --> 22:34.031
I can die for something.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.429
My way, my choice.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.272
To be honest with you, it will be a relief.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.189
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Don't be.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.429
Bill, you need to go.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.231
Go.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.589
(woman) Firemen are battling a fire
at the Al-Hamza Mosque in Culver City.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.638
Members of the mosque
are calling it a retaliation

23:40.720 --> 23:44.793
for this morning's suicide bombing
downtown on a metro bus.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.952
- Scott shouldn't go to school.
- He has a geometry test.

23:48.040 --> 23:52.511
Honey, LA was just hit. I mean,
they should be closing these schools down.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.831
They will when it's not safe.

23:56.920 --> 24:01.675
Until then, I don't wanna scare our son
and I don't want you scaring him, either.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.638
I want us to live our lives
as normally as we can.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.713
No, look, Jillian, there is nothing normal,
what's happening here.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.394
Should we hide in our house
for the rest of our lives?

24:11.480 --> 24:13.516
No, it's just...

24:13.600 --> 24:14.635
Hi.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.110
- Was Ahmed able to help?
- I didn't see him. The FBI are at his house.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.350
They're arresting his dad.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.998
What?

24:28.280 --> 24:31.590
- (man) Why are they taking him?
- I don't know.

24:31.680 --> 24:37.437
This is insane. You can't arrest somebody
without a reason. He's not a terrorist!

24:39.040 --> 24:40.996
He's innocent!

24:41.560 --> 24:45.269
- There's gotta be some reason.
- I'm sure it's a mistake.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.839
Ahmed? What are you doing? (shouting)

25:00.920 --> 25:02.911
We just wanna talk to you, OK?

25:03.480 --> 25:05.232
Ahmed, get out here.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.232
That contractor down the block,
Stan something.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.117
I know. I'll call the police.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.988
Come on! Why don't you get
the hell out of my neighbourhood?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.196
- What are you doing?
- Helping Ahmed.

25:17.280 --> 25:20.272
- Your father is calling the police.
- They won't do anything.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.873
You're not going there.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.669
I'm not hiding while he gets beat up
cos you're scared to do the right thing.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.034
Scott...

25:27.120 --> 25:28.917
Stay here.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.398
I'll handle it.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.710
- I wanna talk.
- Get out of my house.

25:51.800 --> 25:56.715
- We're here to give you friendly advice.
- Stan, what the hell are you doing, man?

25:56.800 --> 26:00.634
I'm trying to protect my family, Ray.
This kid's father's a terrorist.

26:00.720 --> 26:05.191
- He's no more of a terrorist than you or me.
- Yeah? Then why did they arrest him?

26:05.280 --> 26:08.636
- They're scared, like everyone else.
- Get out of my way.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.950
Hey, Stan. Come on! Stan.

26:11.920 --> 26:15.117
If you want him, you're coming through me.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.595
This isn't over, Ray.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.832
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.754
All right, I think you should come stay with us

26:40.840 --> 26:45.516
- until things get sorted with your father.
- I appreciate what you did. I'll be fine.

26:45.600 --> 26:50.310
This guy is ajerk and I don't want
you staying here alone. It's dangerous.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.789
I'm not taking no for an answer.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.317
- Nadia, Bill Buchanan for you.
- Right.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.479
- Bill.
- Jack's at the drop point. Are we set?

26:59.560 --> 27:04.111
The marines have two helicopters ready.
We can hit any target in LA within 20 minutes.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.398
Jack's giving his life for this operation
so I don't want any mistakes.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.710
Assad must be taken out with prejudice.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.157
- He will be, when Fayed gives his location.
- If he calls before I get back, loop me in.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.629
- Yeah. Bill.
- Yeah?

27:19.360 --> 27:22.397
- I'm sidelining Chloe on this operation.
- Why?

27:22.480 --> 27:26.553
She started asking questions about Jack.
I tried putting her off but...

27:26.640 --> 27:29.757
- What did you tell her?
- The truth.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.793
- I'll talk to her when I get there.
- Thanks.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.676
- Psst, psst. Move over.
- What are you doing?

27:42.560 --> 27:46.519
- I'll try and get a visual on Jack.
- Fayed has our surveillance protocols.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.592
He's monitoring radio,
satellites and transmissions.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.114
I have access to a satellite
off the government grid.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.636
- How?
- I worked for a consortium in Uzbekistan.

27:55.720 --> 28:00.555
They needed an illegal aerial survey
of some oil fields, I needed quick cash. Aha.

28:00.640 --> 28:04.633
Look, the little bird, she's still flying.
She's still flying.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.269
- I think I can reposition the camera from here.
- Morris...

28:08.360 --> 28:14.196
Don't thank me yet, love. Just stop sulking
and find out where Bill Buchanan left Jack.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.519
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.271
(phone rings)

29:09.280 --> 29:11.157
- Yes.
- There is a problem.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.117
Don't move out of the tunnel yet.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.113
- What?
- I intercepted a signal to a private satellite.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.031
There are hundreds of them.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.669
The signal is being transmitted
on a government frequency.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.318
What's it looking at?

29:24.400 --> 29:28.712
I can't pinpoint it, but the camera's
been repositioned to your sector.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.750
Connect me to CTU.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.436
Chloe, this is it. This is it.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.310
When the military has Assad's location,

29:39.400 --> 29:42.278
we'll work with law enforcement
to limit damage.

29:42.360 --> 29:47.559
As much as we're trying to prevent civilian
losses, our priority is to take out Assad.

29:47.640 --> 29:51.679
- Fayed is on the line.
- This is Nadia Yassir.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.797
Redirect the satellite
you have aimed at this sector.

29:57.480 --> 29:58.833
What?

29:58.920 --> 30:02.913
Explain the activity on frequency
alpha zero seven zero three.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.391
Bauer is dead either way.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.917
But if you don't redirect that satellite
in 30 seconds, you will lose Assad.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.197
- I'm telling you, there's no satellite.
- 28 seconds.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.517
Nadia.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.513
- Where is this coming from?
- Inside the building.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.239
Where?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.397
Chloe's station.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.029
- Morris...
- What?

30:31.720 --> 30:36.430
- Redirect that satellite. Redirect that satellite.
- The situation is under control.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.956
Fayed tagged you. We may have
lost our chance to locate Assad.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.271
This was a rogue operation.
We're redirecting the satellite.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.918
- You have ten seconds.
- Do it!

30:45.000 --> 30:45.955
9, 8...

30:46.040 --> 30:47.314
- Come on!
- Hurry up.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.550
- 7, 6...
- I'm going as fast as I can.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.438
5, 4...

30:52.520 --> 30:54.272
It's done.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.237
It's moving away.
They redirected the satellite.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.914
- Other channels?
- All clear.

31:01.960 --> 31:06.909
Because of your deception, I will have to
think about giving you Assad's location.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.309
But what about our deal?

31:12.600 --> 31:13.794
Fayed?

31:13.880 --> 31:15.438
(in Arabic language)

31:16.280 --> 31:18.510
(engine starts)

31:25.360 --> 31:29.069
- We may have spooked Fayed.
- I heard what happened!

31:29.160 --> 31:33.517
- Dammit! What were you thinking?!
- It's my fault. You can fire me.

31:33.600 --> 31:38.116
I'd fire both of you now but I can't
afford to lose the manpower. Chloe.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.037
- Look at me.
- I'd rather not, sir.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.111
Look at me.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.837
Don't think you're the only one
mourning Jack. You're not.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.388
That may have been our only option.

31:55.760 --> 31:59.355
You both better hope to God
you didn'tjust blow it.

31:59.440 --> 32:03.115
We may have sacrificed Jack for nothing.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.550
- Karen.
- Have you heard from Fayed?

32:25.640 --> 32:28.234
- Not yet, no.
- The president's worried.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.436
Fayed should have contacted us by now.

32:30.520 --> 32:34.399
There may be a problem. There's a possibility
Fayed's going back on the deal.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.870
- What are you talking about?
- He caught us trying to track Jack.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.713
The orders were that he was
to have a clear field.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.078
Chloe thought there was a work-around.
She did it without authorisation.

32:45.160 --> 32:50.109
She's your responsibility. How could you
let this happen? If we don't take out Assad...

32:50.200 --> 32:52.555
I don't need a lecture. I know the stakes.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.200
I don't think you do.
If these attacks don't stop,

32:55.280 --> 33:00.752
there are people here willing to tear up the
Constitution in the name of national security.

33:00.840 --> 33:05.709
The things they're talking about doing -
this country will never recover.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.839
As soon as I hear from Fayed,
you'll be my first call.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.756
I'm sorry, Bill. It's just, I'm...

33:13.840 --> 33:17.549
There's no need to apologise.
We're all feeling it.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.517
I have to go.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.712
- Anything?
- It's clear.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.837
- Are you sure?
- Yes. They're leaving us alone.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.832
The money's been transferred.
Shall we call CTU?

33:35.920 --> 33:37.911
Not yet.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.715
You need to call CTU.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.309
(speaks Arabic language)

34:16.480 --> 34:18.471
(beeping)

34:19.760 --> 34:25.357
I won't let you die till I'm ready. The Chinese
didn't leave much for me to work with.

34:25.440 --> 34:30.070
But before you die,
you're going to feel what my brother felt.

34:30.159 --> 34:33.789
I saw his body. I know how he died.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.310
I know what you did to him.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.592
(speaks Arabic language)

34:45.719 --> 34:51.192
You don't need me to tell you
that the nerves are bundled here...

35:07.120 --> 35:09.793
(beeping increases)

35:16.440 --> 35:18.431
Better.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.068
You need to give CTU Assad's location.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.958
That was the deal.

35:28.040 --> 35:31.396
Assad has lost faith in our fight.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.228
He thinks our tactics are failing.

35:35.320 --> 35:38.357
He's begun talking about compromise,

35:38.440 --> 35:41.591
about laying down our arms and negotiating.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.429
But there is no compromise, no negotiation.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.796
Assad is a traitor.

35:51.480 --> 35:56.031
And soon, inshallah, he will be dead.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.194
That's right, Jack.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.272
CTU is about to kill the wrong man.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.552
Assad isn't behind these attacks.

36:08.440 --> 36:11.352
He's come here to stop them.

36:11.440 --> 36:15.433
He's come here... to stop... me.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.591
(rapid beeping)

36:34.680 --> 36:37.069
You will die for nothing.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.435
If Fayed doesn't call in five minutes,
reassign everyone here.

36:48.760 --> 36:52.036
- This is Buchanan.
- You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine.

36:52.120 --> 36:55.749
- I'm listening.
- I have a transponder at Assad's location.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.275
33-58-11 north latitude.

37:01.360 --> 37:06.275
118-21-40 west longitude.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.716
You'll find Assad there.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.078
- Where is that?
- It's coming.

37:14.080 --> 37:14.671
Inglewood.

37:14.760 --> 37:20.118
Have Bowen mobilise the helicopters. I'll tell
the president we're a go. Cut Fayed's access.

37:20.200 --> 37:24.239
I want to lock down all of our satellites.
Shut 'em down. You got it?

37:31.560 --> 37:34.074
We did everything we could.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.155
I know it's truly awful, but if it stops
these attacks, it's for the greater good.

37:42.240 --> 37:46.233
There's no one that understands that
more than Jack.

38:09.720 --> 38:13.599
Do you remember doing this to my brother?

38:15.160 --> 38:16.878
- Fayed?
- What is it?

38:16.960 --> 38:20.270
There is a call for you. It's important.

38:26.440 --> 38:30.069
(speaking Arabic language)

38:40.080 --> 38:42.310
- Yes.
- (Ahmed) There's a problem.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.359
- Tell me what happened.
- The FBI. They took my father.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.794
Where are you?

38:50.680 --> 38:55.674
I'm at a neighbour's. You know my father is
innocent. He has no idea what we're doing.

38:55.760 --> 39:00.914
If your father is meant to be sacrificed,
that is how it will be.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.958
Now tell me what the FBI said.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.431
(Iong beep)

39:42.360 --> 39:45.193
Good. You did the right thing.

39:45.280 --> 39:50.035
- Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package?
- Yes. It's well hidden.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.510
- You need to deliver it soon.
- I'll call you when I have it.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.312
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.517
It was my uncle. He's trying
to find out where they took my dad.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.034
- Wanna come eat?
- Yeah.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.275
(speaking Arabic language)

40:27.720 --> 40:29.711
Get in there!

40:30.880 --> 40:32.871
Find him!
