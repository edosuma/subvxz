WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:11.053
-9-1-1, what's your emergency?
-I, I...

00:11.261 --> 00:13.722
-Hello?
-I, I don't know. I think--

00:13.805 --> 00:15.140
Ma'am, what's your emergency?

00:15.224 --> 00:18.477
-He's dead, he's dead.
-Mom?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.439
Daddy!

00:22.523 --> 00:24.358
Former Stanford professor
and cult author...

00:24.441 --> 00:25.817
-No! Come on, please.
-...killed in his own home

00:25.901 --> 00:27.236
while his wife and daughters slept--

00:27.319 --> 00:30.697
Chuck Buhrman was murdered in his home,
stabbed multiple times.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.660
Sixteen-year-old Warren Cave
was taken into custody this morning.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.287
Witnesses saw Cave and the victim
in a heated argument

00:37.371 --> 00:38.580
-during the Halloween party.
-Judge ruled today

00:38.664 --> 00:41.124
that the 16-year-old boy
will be tried as an adult.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.970
-May I proceed, Your Honor?
-You may proceed.

01:35.637 --> 01:40.017
This was testimony given by the witness
at the June 2000 trial of Warren Cave.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.688
You said a noise woke you up.
Is that correct?

01:44.771 --> 01:45.814
Yes.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.399
After you woke up, what did you do?

01:47.482 --> 01:50.277
I looked out my window and saw
someone jumping the fence.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.197
Could you please identify that person?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.407
My neighbor, Warren Cave.

01:55.824 --> 01:56.950
Are you sure?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.119
100 percent.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.329
Once more.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.456
Are you sure?

02:03.624 --> 02:04.708
100 percent.

02:05.209 --> 02:08.711
Now, this is her statement
to the police six months earlier.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.466
Lanie, on Halloween night,
the night of the murder,

02:12.549 --> 02:15.969
did you see the person
before they jumped the fence?

02:17.596 --> 02:18.597
I think so.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.433
You think so?

02:29.900 --> 02:31.026
I'm pretty sure.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.695
Now, one more time, Lanie.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.032
Did you recognize the individual
who jumped the back fence?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.034
Go ahead.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.497
Say it.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.792
Yes. It was Warren.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.378
Warren Cave?

02:50.295 --> 02:51.421
Yes.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.466
Is this the bulk of your new evidence,
Ms. Cedillo?

02:54.550 --> 02:57.594
Yes. And if I may, Your Honor,
it's obvious from the new video

02:57.678 --> 02:59.555
-she was coached into a statement--
-Obvious to you.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.224
Hold on.
Let me tell you what can be argued.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.434
The trial footage shows a young woman

03:04.518 --> 03:07.062
who's had six months
to process her father's death

03:07.145 --> 03:08.605
and the events of that night.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.525
In the found footage,
I see a distraught teenage girl

03:11.608 --> 03:15.612
being questioned a mere 48 hours
after the brutal murder of her father.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.407
These are trying circumstances
for the best of us.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.119
But there is not enough evidence
to constitute a new trial.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.328
Motion denied.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.414
My son is innocent.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.878
I'm sorry, Ms. Cave.
I hope you find some peace.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.798
Why doesn't anyone see
that my son is innocent?

03:50.606 --> 03:53.567
She won a Pulitzer Prize
for her investigative journalism work

03:53.650 --> 03:57.362
during her 20 years at The New York Times
before leaving to start what has become

03:57.446 --> 04:00.574
one of the most popular
true crime podcasts on iTunes.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.660
Here to discuss the changing landscape
of American journalism,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.246
it is my pleasure
to welcome Poppy Parnell.

04:11.877 --> 04:16.714
Ben Bradlee,
a titan of journalism, had a quote:

04:17.132 --> 04:23.430
"As long as a journalist tells the truth,
in conscience and fairness,

04:24.181 --> 04:26.934
it's not his job
to worry about consequences."

04:28.393 --> 04:31.897
The truth is never as dangerous as a lie
in the long run.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.774
Say it.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.484
It was Warren.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.194
My son is innocent.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.534
The truth is the only guide.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.137
-Poppy?
-In the kitchen!

05:07.683 --> 05:10.185
What's... What's going on?

05:12.563 --> 05:13.814
Thought I'd cook.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.441
The queen of takeout?

05:16.525 --> 05:19.444
You haven't fired up that stove
since we moved in.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.196
So it's about time then.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.825
What is going on?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.327
Just have to start the roux.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.626
Let me ask you a question.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.503
Hit me.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.588
If...

05:38.672 --> 05:42.467
a man got convicted of murder
based off eyewitness testimony,

05:42.551 --> 05:44.970
you know,
somebody saw him leaving the scene,

05:45.721 --> 05:49.099
and then you find out
that eyewitness was coached,

05:49.183 --> 05:51.393
shouldn't that be enough
to get him a new trial?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.396
Who are we talking about?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.273
Warren Cave.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.777
What? The kid that you wrote
the story about 20 years ago?

06:00.861 --> 06:01.862
Nineteen.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.489
There was a hearing today.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.994
The defense got their hands on a videotape
of Lanie Buhrman's statement.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.121
She was lying. I know it.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.873
I got...

06:13.290 --> 06:18.504
all these awards hanging in my office
from those articles about Warren.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.839
That entire series launched my career,

06:20.923 --> 06:24.051
and now I can't stop wondering
if I was wrong.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.387
You didn't investigate the crime, Poppy.
You wrote the stories.

06:28.138 --> 06:33.644
But my stories got the whole world
to think that he was evil incarnate.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.938
I'm the reason he got tried as an adult.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.232
Remember the one juror that got dismissed

06:38.315 --> 06:41.235
because they found him reading my articles
during the lunch break?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.364
Oh, my God, Ingram, if he's innocent...

06:45.447 --> 06:47.491
Hey, come on. You have to let this go.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.040
Yeah. I mean, there's nothing I can do
about it anyway, right?

06:55.123 --> 06:57.417
No, listen, hey,
you saw it in action. Okay?

06:57.501 --> 06:59.920
The chances of overturning a verdict

07:00.003 --> 07:03.757
or even getting a retrial
are a million to one.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.717
Now...

07:08.345 --> 07:10.931
can I call somewhere
to make a reservation?

07:11.849 --> 07:15.060
Please.
'Cause this is not going to end well.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.646
-You know?
-I'm gonna make it just to spite you.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.728
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.481
-I want to do a different story.
-No shit.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.275
Warren Cave. Thanks.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.991
Happy birthday to you

09:34.575 --> 09:39.913
Happy birthday, dear Josie and Lanie

09:39.997 --> 09:42.165
-Happy birthday to you
-We all know those families.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.501
The ones at the center
of their neighborhood.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.129
The ones with the happiest marriage,

09:47.212 --> 09:49.047
-the perfect kids.
-And there you go.

09:49.131 --> 09:53.135
The greenest lawn, the most loyal dog,
the brightest Christmas lights.

09:54.136 --> 09:58.015
The ones that are effectively... perfect?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.350
-Merry Christmas.
-Look right over here.

10:00.434 --> 10:04.229
In Menlo Park,
the Buhrmans were that family.

10:05.063 --> 10:10.944
Chuck, a celebrated author and respected
professor at Stanford University.

10:11.028 --> 10:15.699
Erin, a talented artist who put her career
on hold to raise a family.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.621
And Lanie and Josie,
their high-achieving twin daughters.

10:21.163 --> 10:27.628
A perfect life shattered
on October 31, 1999.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.007
Here's what Menlo Park Police
say happened.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.510
Chuck Buhrman was up late,

10:34.593 --> 10:38.472
catching up on work
after the family's annual Halloween party.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.225
He sent 11 e-mails after midnight,

10:41.308 --> 10:44.811
the last one at 2:44 a.m.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.564
All work-related and all routine.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.944
The assailant entered through a back door.

10:52.653 --> 10:56.949
With his wife and daughters upstairs,
Chuck went to investigate.

11:04.206 --> 11:08.836
He made it to the doorway of his office
where the bulk of the attack took place.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.341
The assailant escaped
through the back door,

11:14.424 --> 11:18.011
hopped over the back fence
and disappeared into the darkness.

11:18.679 --> 11:23.100
Chuck's body was found the next morning
by his wife, Erin.

11:23.976 --> 11:28.272
Erin, along with twin daughters,
Josie and Lanie,

11:28.355 --> 11:31.233
had slept through the slaughter.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.194
The case against Warren
was largely circumstantial.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.906
Police did not have a witness
to the actual attack.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.910
They didn't find Warren's DNA
anywhere on Chuck's body,

11:41.994 --> 11:45.497
and they never recovered
the murder weapon.

11:45.831 --> 11:50.252
But there were two pieces of hard evidence
linking him to the crime scene.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.546
Fingerprints found near the body

11:52.629 --> 11:57.718
and the testimony of Chuck's
15-year-old daughter, Lanie Buhrman.

11:57.801 --> 12:02.347
But what if Warren Cave
didn't kill Chuck Buhrman?

12:02.848 --> 12:07.853
And if Warren didn't, who did and why?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.357
-You see what's missing?
-Yeah.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.776
We need Warren. No Warren, no story.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.904
-If I could be so bold.
-Yeah. Shoot.

12:17.196 --> 12:18.822
Why would he ever talk to you?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.365
Because I could help him.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.201
You really think he's innocent?

12:22.659 --> 12:25.495
I don't know. But I need to find out.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.917
-He won't see me, Des.
-You can't be surprised by that.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.628
So why are you letting it stop you?

12:33.587 --> 12:34.963
You need him, right?

12:35.297 --> 12:39.218
Without Warren, it's just me telling
a story indulging in my own guilt. But--

12:39.301 --> 12:40.469
No. Don't "but."

12:41.053 --> 12:42.721
Don't bullshit.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.098
You can lie to everybody but me.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.351
Being told "no" has never stopped you.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.560
Now you're talking shit.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.980
You will bulldog the shit out of something
if someone else is doing wrong

12:52.064 --> 12:53.106
or if it's about work.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.318
But when it's about you,
the real, you're out.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.528
That's not true.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.030
Remember your ex, Markus?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.199
He cheated. What was I supposed to do?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.952
I don't know.
Cuss him out. But you just jetted.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.703
You took a job
you weren't even thinking about.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.706
-It was The New York Times!
-It was a broken heart.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.212
For reals though.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.048
You're scared.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.051
'Cause you don't wanna
look Warren in the face.

13:21.510 --> 13:22.511
I don't.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.513
But you're gonna have to.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.473
You will not be able to live with yourself

13:26.557 --> 13:29.768
if you were wrong,
and he has suffered because of it.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.271
I helped to put him where he is.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.356
And you could be the reason he gets out.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.067
Woman up. Handle that.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.654
Do whatever you have to do
to get in there and see him.

13:53.292 --> 13:54.376
Mrs. Cave.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.630
Get off my property.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.090
I just need a minute.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.675
Go to hell.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.555
Damn it! Damn it.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.432
Just hear me out.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.186
Doing a new podcast series...

14:13.353 --> 14:15.022
...entirely about Warren.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.109
What?

14:19.693 --> 14:23.405
In order for it to work,
I need to talk to your son.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.744
Which is why I was hoping
you could help me get in to see him.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.582
-Are you kidding me?
-This could help him.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.293
Create public pressure
to maybe get him another trial.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.129
What, suddenly you give a shit?

14:40.464 --> 14:42.466
I would be skeptical too.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.768
But if he is innocent, maybe I can
do something to make a difference.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.439
What did my son want to become
when he was growing up?

14:57.940 --> 15:02.027
What was his favorite subject in school?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.197
Did he sleep with a night-light?

15:06.615 --> 15:07.908
You don't know.

15:07.991 --> 15:12.621
Because you never wanted to know because
that would've made my son a human being.

15:12.955 --> 15:17.835
Instead of this twisted creature that
you were so desperately trying to sell.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.754
You exploited my son once.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.800
Never gonna let that happen again.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.802
Okay, I know.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.556
I know you hate me.
And you probably deserve to.

15:30.973 --> 15:31.974
Yeah.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.311
But if you're running out of time,
what have you got to lose?

15:37.855 --> 15:38.856
What?

15:39.273 --> 15:40.440
Does Warren know?

15:42.651 --> 15:44.319
Know what? What are you talking about?

15:44.987 --> 15:45.988
My mother.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.948
Breast cancer.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.827
She had the same diet during chemo.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.454
How long did they give you?

15:54.830 --> 15:55.914
Six months.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.292
When?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.128
Four months ago.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.548
Then let me help you.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.136
You're a horrible woman.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.389
Stop using us
to make yourself feel better.

16:14.892 --> 16:15.893
Mela--

16:16.351 --> 16:17.686
Well, maybe we don't need him.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.355
There's so many other ways
to dig into this story.

16:20.439 --> 16:23.483
Noa, I appreciate the positive spin,

16:23.567 --> 16:27.529
but this story is about freeing
a potentially innocent man.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.948
If I don't talk to that man,
I don't have a story.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.533
But if you can't get to Warren...

16:31.617 --> 16:32.826
I'll find another way.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.787
What about you? You get anything?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.456
Nothing on Erin or Josie,

16:37.539 --> 16:40.751
but Lanie Buhrman,
you won't believe what she's doing now.

16:40.834 --> 16:41.919
What about her?

16:42.002 --> 16:43.921
She's working as a death doula.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.048
What's that?

16:46.131 --> 16:48.550
Same as a birth doula except death.

16:48.884 --> 16:52.721
The daughter of a murder victim
helps people to die.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.432
I will never fucking
understand California.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.698
-Can I help you?
-Are you Lanie Buhrman?

18:35.699 --> 18:37.534
-Who's asking?
-My name is Poppy Parnell.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.161
I'm here to talk about Warren Cave.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.662
-Not interested.
-Ms. Buhrman, please.

18:40.746 --> 18:43.123
Dunn. Lanie Dunn.
I don't use Buhrman anymore.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.042
It attracts creeps.

18:45.501 --> 18:48.462
-I'd like to talk to you about--
-I know what you wanna talk to me about.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.214
I am not interested.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.132
I saw the video of your statement.

18:53.759 --> 18:54.885
Mom!

18:57.387 --> 18:58.680
Everything all right?

18:58.764 --> 19:00.307
Yeah. We're all done here. Right?

19:00.933 --> 19:02.309
Thank you for your time.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.561
-Mom!
-Hey. Come here!

19:04.645 --> 19:07.064
-Hi. How are you?
-Good. Who's that?

19:07.648 --> 19:08.815
Nobody.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.442
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.667
"He who dwells
in the shelter of the Most High

19:27.209 --> 19:29.294
will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.549
I will say of the Lord,
'He is my refuge and my fortress,

19:33.632 --> 19:35.676
my God in whom I trust.'

19:36.301 --> 19:39.596
Surely,
He will save you from the fowler's snare

19:39.680 --> 19:41.682
and from the deadly pestilence.

19:42.182 --> 19:46.895
He will cover you with His feathers,
and under His wings you will find refuge.

19:47.521 --> 19:51.149
His faithfulness
will be your shield and rampart.

19:51.483 --> 19:55.988
You will not fear the terror of night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

19:56.071 --> 19:56.989
You in trouble.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.740
...the pestilence
that stalks in the darkness...

19:58.824 --> 20:01.827
-You gonna get a whippin'.
-...or plague that destroys at midday."

20:04.913 --> 20:06.832
-Amen.
-Amen.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.252
Hi, Sister Claire.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.380
Sister Claire. Have a good one.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.633
-You ready for your party, Daddy?
-I ain't ready to get older.

20:16.717 --> 20:19.761
Well, it's either a party thrown by your
family or one given by the undertaker.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.014
The first one sounds good to me.

20:24.183 --> 20:26.268
I'm sorry, Daddy. Excuse me.

20:27.019 --> 20:27.895
Hello?

20:28.312 --> 20:32.316
Listen, I don't trust a word that you say,
Ms. Parnell,

20:32.399 --> 20:34.610
but I've gotten you in to see him.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.362
-What?
-Warren. In San Quentin.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.281
Thank you, Melanie. You won't regret this.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.158
And this is nonnegotiable.

20:41.241 --> 20:44.536
You say nothing about my condition.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.829
Understood.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.916
You ready? Lillian got food at the house.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.420
I got a little business thing
that I need to handle.

20:53.504 --> 20:56.340
Church on Sunday, food with the family.
That's how we do it.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.092
I know, Daddy.
I'll see you at the party next week.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.637
-Love you, Daddy.
-Love you too.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.764
Let's go.

21:04.348 --> 21:06.558
Where she going? Not like she got a job.

21:19.780 --> 21:23.283
When most kids his age
were graduating from high school,

21:23.367 --> 21:26.119
joining the army, starting new jobs,

21:26.203 --> 21:29.039
getting ready for college,
planning for the future,

21:29.122 --> 21:32.501
going to parties with friends,
falling in love...

21:33.502 --> 21:35.212
Warren Cave went to prison.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.882
He was 17 years old.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.428
Ladies and gentlemen,
as we begin processing, please understand

21:43.512 --> 21:45.639
-that you're required to be compliant.
-Seventeen. Think about that.

21:47.182 --> 21:48.767
I'm going to lift your bra.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.519
Please allow your breasts to hang.

21:51.854 --> 21:55.899
I understand what it's like
to be an innocent child,

21:56.525 --> 22:00.070
discarded and thrown into a place
where there's only darkness.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.784
That's why this stands
as my deepest regret.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.036
Warren Cave.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.206
Warren Cave?

22:14.293 --> 22:16.378
Member of the press here to see a Level 2.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.273
Thanks for seeing me.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.318
Did your mother tell you why I'm here?

22:40.068 --> 22:43.197
You're the journalist from before.

22:44.781 --> 22:45.991
Okay if I write?

22:47.951 --> 22:49.244
Why are you here?

22:50.037 --> 22:51.872
I think I can help you this time.

22:52.581 --> 22:54.583
Look, not the bullshit.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.085
The truth.

22:58.587 --> 22:59.713
-Warren, listen--
-Warren?

23:01.882 --> 23:03.133
First name?

23:06.220 --> 23:13.143
I live in a house full of men
who breathe to lie...

23:14.311 --> 23:18.524
and I could smell yours
before you even started talking.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.568
You're full of shit.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.570
Well, I'm here now.

23:24.363 --> 23:25.697
I can make up for it.

23:25.781 --> 23:26.782
Can you?

23:28.700 --> 23:30.244
And now you are here...

23:31.495 --> 23:32.579
for my blood.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.750
Vampire.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.048
You fucking predator.

23:46.385 --> 23:51.139
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

23:53.058 --> 23:58.105
Catch a tiger by her toe.

23:59.731 --> 24:03.777
If she hollers, don't let her go.

24:05.654 --> 24:11.159
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

24:13.370 --> 24:15.455
-Where you going?
-Guard.

24:18.709 --> 24:20.252
Why you running, Poppy?

24:30.262 --> 24:33.098
Damn it! God damn it. Damn it.

24:44.902 --> 24:47.446
You didn't tell me your son
was a damn Nazi.

24:51.617 --> 24:54.578
-Does it really matter?
-Of course it does.

24:56.330 --> 25:01.126
A woman so noble
that she overlooked the faults of an enemy

25:01.210 --> 25:03.629
to prove his innocence.

25:04.213 --> 25:07.925
I can see the headlines now.
Hell, I can see the movie.

25:08.926 --> 25:11.261
-You good, love?
-I'll have another Popsicle.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.222
-Sure thing.
-Thank you.

25:14.932 --> 25:20.938
Whatever you saw in there,
that's not who my son really is.

25:21.355 --> 25:22.814
Don't be that mother.

25:23.232 --> 25:25.984
Your son is bone-deep
in that raggedy tribe.

25:26.068 --> 25:30.072
My son was sent to prison as a child.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.574
Your articles helped put him there.

25:32.658 --> 25:36.036
He would never have become that thing
if he wasn't locked up.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.162
You don't know that.

25:37.246 --> 25:41.583
I know that there is a monster
inside every one of us,

25:41.667 --> 25:44.837
and his was unleashed in prison.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.966
Mine when I smoked my first cigarette.

25:49.550 --> 25:50.676
What about you?

25:51.301 --> 25:52.469
What's in there?

25:53.720 --> 25:58.016
Was it your monster that made you
disregard an innocent boy

25:58.100 --> 26:00.143
for all these years

26:00.227 --> 26:02.187
and then come and sit here today

26:02.271 --> 26:06.191
and judge the man
that he was forced to become?

26:07.526 --> 26:10.946
Help me get my son out of prison

26:11.029 --> 26:14.366
so I can see him again, on the outside,

26:14.449 --> 26:17.744
and maybe God will forget
that you're a sinner.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.707
Maybe He'll let your monster sleep.

26:36.263 --> 26:38.724
Hey, guys. Jimmy. Jack. Good to see y'all.

26:40.559 --> 26:42.686
-Yeah, it looks right.
-Hey.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.897
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:45.397 --> 26:47.024
Why were you texting me all panicked?

26:47.107 --> 26:49.693
I need some help with something.
A little advice.

26:50.319 --> 26:51.945
Okay. That looks good.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.655
You good? Looks good, Herbie.

26:57.659 --> 26:58.702
This is easy.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.414
Don't use the juice you got from
that podcast to help some AB motherfucker.

27:02.497 --> 27:03.916
That's it. That's all. It's simple.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.335
Wait, what? Miss Social Justice Warrior?

27:06.418 --> 27:08.128
Swastikas will change some shit.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.255
I built my career on that boy's back, D.

27:10.339 --> 27:12.216
And a country was built on ours. Now what?

27:12.299 --> 27:14.009
You know what I hate about this family?

27:14.426 --> 27:16.470
Typical responses to complicated shit.

27:16.553 --> 27:19.556
How the hell you cracking on the family
and shedding tears over a racist asshole?

27:19.640 --> 27:22.184
I'm shedding-- I'm not shedding tears.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.435
Okay? I just--

27:24.228 --> 27:26.605
There is some guilt
if I had anything to do with this.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.981
That's what the Lord is for.

27:29.483 --> 27:30.526
Look, you want a cause?

27:30.609 --> 27:32.819
Use your juice to get
Butchie out of Pelican Bay.

27:32.903 --> 27:35.447
He had a drunk public defender.
No eyewitnesses.

27:35.531 --> 27:36.532
Bullshit charges.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.700
His mother died while he was in there.

27:38.784 --> 27:41.328
Or our cousin, who you never visit.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.539
What are y'all fussing about?

27:43.997 --> 27:45.040
Hey, Big Time.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.584
I thought you was too good
to come hang out at the bar.

27:47.668 --> 27:50.295
-I don't have time for your shit, Lillian.
-My shit?

27:50.379 --> 27:52.756
I just came out here
'cause we getting ready to start the boil.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.049
The crawfish just got here.

27:55.259 --> 27:58.220
Hey, come look at the bike
I got your daddy for his birthday.

28:04.226 --> 28:05.227
Bam.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.312
You like it?

28:08.021 --> 28:09.106
Daddy will like it.

28:13.944 --> 28:15.028
Come on, girl.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.532
We got family. We got good music.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.033
We got crawfish.

28:20.701 --> 28:22.494
And we got a step-mama younger than you.

28:23.829 --> 28:25.205
You need to quit.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.834
I think this is gonna work for him.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.092
Watch out, baby. Watch out.

28:39.761 --> 28:43.390
-Hey.
-Thank you.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.474
Is this free?

28:44.558 --> 28:45.684
On the house.

28:46.518 --> 28:47.519
Oh, there's Daddy.

28:47.603 --> 28:49.438
-Hey.
-Thank you. God bless you.

28:49.521 --> 28:50.898
Hey, Shreve. What's up, baby?

28:50.981 --> 28:52.482
Bless you, brother.

28:55.402 --> 28:57.571
Oh, man.

29:00.741 --> 29:02.492
Why you laughin' so hard?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.122
Cheers.

29:10.042 --> 29:12.085
-Good stuff.
-It is.

29:14.129 --> 29:15.839
I see you still on that Hangar 1.

29:16.340 --> 29:19.092
-How you doing, Markus?
-Not as good as you.

29:19.176 --> 29:22.304
Talk to me. What's happening?
You tryin' to avoid me or somethin'?

29:22.387 --> 29:25.015
I've been in here almost an hour.
You ain't come talk to me once.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.976
Ain't nobody worried about you.
Is your wife here?

29:29.144 --> 29:30.604
You know I'm divorced.

29:31.021 --> 29:33.357
-I don't keep tabs on you.
-Oh, yeah?

29:34.316 --> 29:35.359
Well, lookee here,

29:35.442 --> 29:40.113
Miss Don't Keep Tabs, your sister tells me
you was looking into some old crime.

29:40.531 --> 29:42.574
Now, you know I'm not with OPD anymore,

29:42.658 --> 29:45.953
but I still do a little investigating
on the side for them.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.037
A small fee.

29:48.705 --> 29:51.208
-My sister talks too much.
-Since the cradle.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.671
You know that ain't got nothing
to do with nothing.

29:55.754 --> 30:00.425
Hey, listen, and this is serious,
if you need anything, anything...

30:01.009 --> 30:02.511
all you gotta do is holler.

30:05.055 --> 30:06.431
-I'm good.
-Oh, you good now?

30:06.515 --> 30:07.850
-I'm good.
-You good?

30:08.267 --> 30:10.060
-Are you sure?
-She's good.

30:11.228 --> 30:13.522
Ingram Rhoades. Poppy's husband.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.984
All right, brother. Markus Killebrew.

30:17.651 --> 30:19.027
Poppy's roadkill.

30:19.820 --> 30:22.614
-Always worried about my sister.
-Oh, there she is.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.533
You should holler at me sometime.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.910
If I did that,
then I'd have to worry about you.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.872
-Well, is that bad?
-She don't stop.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.333
Y'all enjoy your evening.

30:35.419 --> 30:36.587
-Hey there.
-Hey.

30:38.255 --> 30:39.840
Trifling. You are so trifling.

30:41.258 --> 30:43.510
"Hey, y'all enjoy your evening."

30:43.594 --> 30:45.846
You guys sound so great.
Thanks for coming.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.181
Happy birthday, man.

30:47.598 --> 30:48.599
-Hey!
-Hey.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.518
When you gonna have me and Lillian
up to that fancy house?

30:51.602 --> 30:53.520
Oh, you welcome anytime, Daddy.

30:54.563 --> 30:56.773
Hey! Watch what the hell you doing!

30:56.857 --> 30:58.192
-Sorry, man.
-It's okay, Daddy.

30:58.275 --> 30:59.651
I'm all right. Just calm down.

30:59.735 --> 31:02.654
"Calm down"?
Who are you to tell me what to do?

31:02.738 --> 31:03.822
Daddy?

31:03.906 --> 31:05.282
Everything okay?

31:05.365 --> 31:08.368
This silly woman sitting here
trying to tell me what to do.

31:08.911 --> 31:11.830
Okay, Boo, I got this. It's cool.

31:11.914 --> 31:14.124
You go on and enjoy the rest of the party.

31:16.585 --> 31:17.711
Wait, where you going?

31:19.379 --> 31:20.881
To get something to eat.

31:23.550 --> 31:24.635
Poppy?

31:25.219 --> 31:26.220
Yeah, Daddy.

31:26.303 --> 31:29.431
I always knew you'd find a way
to mess things all up.

31:29.515 --> 31:32.309
Got more of your mama's blood in you
than mine, and all of them crazy.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.061
Okay, now wait a minute, old man.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.480
This party here is for you.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.066
Everybody that's here, baby, is for you.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.902
-Okay?
-Yeah, sweetheart. Okay.

31:42.444 --> 31:44.446
Hey, Popsicle!

31:44.530 --> 31:46.615
Come here. Give me some sugar.

31:48.492 --> 31:49.826
Go on and enjoy yourself.

31:51.245 --> 31:53.455
-Sit with me, sweetheart.
-Absolutely.

31:56.291 --> 31:58.210
Something's wrong with Daddy.

31:59.711 --> 32:03.799
For a moment, he didn't even recognize me.
He said the most hateful things.

32:04.258 --> 32:06.176
Your father's always been edgy.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.428
No. It wasn't that.

32:09.054 --> 32:10.347
It was different.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.684
Lillian wasn't surprised.

32:13.767 --> 32:16.562
Let's wait for everybody to sober up.

32:16.645 --> 32:18.689
Find out what they all know.

32:54.808 --> 32:55.976
Hey, Aunt Susan.

32:56.393 --> 32:57.811
Jesus, Lanie.

32:57.895 --> 33:00.314
Sorry. I used my key.

33:00.397 --> 33:01.773
No, you don't need to be sorry.

33:01.857 --> 33:04.985
Just text me
so I know that you're gonna be here.

33:06.195 --> 33:07.196
What's going on?

33:10.282 --> 33:14.995
You know how every few years
a vulture comes out of the woodwork

33:15.078 --> 33:17.039
and starts asking about my dad?

33:18.916 --> 33:21.168
-What now?
-This woman.

33:21.793 --> 33:26.507
She came to my house, and she accosted me
in front of Alex and Ella.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.051
-Who?
-Poppy Parnell.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.136
You remember? She's that reporter.

33:31.220 --> 33:34.264
She wrote a bunch of stories about Warren
for the Chronicle?

33:34.681 --> 33:36.517
She's doing a podcast.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.060
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

33:38.143 --> 33:40.854
Because none of us should be
saying anything to her.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.858
But I do need to talk to Josie.

33:47.528 --> 33:49.530
I bought some ice cream.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.407
I remember when that would fix everything.

33:52.491 --> 33:54.409
-It's mint chip. Want some?
-Aunt Susan.

33:54.493 --> 33:56.912
I really need to warn Josie.

33:57.538 --> 33:59.414
Your sister wants to be left alone.

33:59.498 --> 34:01.750
I know that.
That's why I need to talk to her.

34:02.167 --> 34:05.045
Because what if this woman goes after her?

34:06.839 --> 34:10.050
If it's an emergency,
I can get a message to her.

34:11.635 --> 34:14.137
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

34:14.763 --> 34:17.431
Don't let this woman upend
all the hard work that you've done.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.601
You've come too far.

34:20.936 --> 34:21.937
Okay?

34:23.397 --> 34:24.898
-Promise?
-Promise.

34:45.460 --> 34:49.755
Was it your monster
that made you disregard an innocent boy

34:49.840 --> 34:51.632
for all these years?

34:56.429 --> 34:58.891
-What?
-Leave it off, babe.

35:00.309 --> 35:02.394
-What's going on?
-Nothing. Just...

35:03.478 --> 35:04.646
No. Talk to me.

35:06.648 --> 35:07.900
I didn't do enough.

35:08.984 --> 35:10.235
With your father?

35:11.195 --> 35:12.196
No.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.615
For Warren Cave.

35:15.699 --> 35:19.161
Baby, you-- Baby, you can't
beat yourself up about that. Okay?

35:19.244 --> 35:21.747
You wrote those stories based on
what you knew at the time,

35:21.830 --> 35:23.665
and you didn't know about the tape.

35:26.877 --> 35:27.961
But I did.

35:30.631 --> 35:33.050
When I first looked into
Warren's case, I...

35:33.884 --> 35:37.846
I heard rumors about Lanie being coached.

35:38.931 --> 35:41.850
That there was a tape.
I could've looked into it.

35:44.978 --> 35:46.188
When did you hear?

35:47.397 --> 35:49.316
When I was writing the second article.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.860
You never told me that.

35:51.944 --> 35:55.531
Well, the series
was already getting attention.

35:56.156 --> 35:59.785
It felt meaningful. Impactful.

36:00.536 --> 36:02.371
It was opening doors for me.

36:03.121 --> 36:07.459
But it was all based on the idea
that Warren was guilty.

36:08.836 --> 36:12.089
The tape didn't matter at that point
if it was true.

36:12.172 --> 36:14.967
-Did you bury evidence?
-No. Of course not.

36:15.050 --> 36:16.051
-No.
-Okay. All right.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.427
Then help me understand here.

36:17.511 --> 36:21.098
Because there are a million rumors
about any given case.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.600
Did you trust the source?

36:23.684 --> 36:26.061
I never looked into it, Ingram.

36:26.687 --> 36:28.605
I told myself it didn't matter.

36:29.147 --> 36:31.859
But it was my job to look at everything.

36:31.942 --> 36:33.277
I chose not to.

36:35.445 --> 36:37.489
I can't ignore it a second time.

36:39.575 --> 36:40.576
Yes, you can.

36:40.659 --> 36:42.953
Ingram. I can't.

36:52.671 --> 36:55.340
You think I believe that pathetic shit
on your arms?

36:57.009 --> 37:00.804
You think I believe that squirrelly
little boy from Menlo Park,

37:00.888 --> 37:05.517
the one without a single friend,
arrived believing all that?

37:08.353 --> 37:11.940
You joined up so you wouldn't
have to become someone's bitch.

37:13.317 --> 37:16.653
I bet they were trading you
like playing cards.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.739
Popping your ass like bubble gum.

37:20.532 --> 37:26.163
If you're tired of that, of this,
we can get to work.

37:35.172 --> 37:36.590
Your mother's dying.

37:43.722 --> 37:44.723
Oh, yeah?

37:47.559 --> 37:48.769
What's wrong with her?

37:48.852 --> 37:50.938
-Tell me about the Buhrmans.
-Fuck you!

37:51.021 --> 37:52.481
Get mad if you want.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.611
Get mad if you want to.

37:57.694 --> 38:00.405
But she won't tell you,
and she might not come back.

38:01.782 --> 38:04.117
And then she'll die
without you ever seeing her again.

38:06.870 --> 38:09.331
Why were your prints found
all over that house?

38:11.041 --> 38:13.502
I used to go "hunting"
at the Buhrman house.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.472
"Hunting"?

38:26.390 --> 38:28.725
Just stupid kid shit.

38:30.269 --> 38:36.191
The mom, Erin Buhrman used to play
like she was better than everyone else.

38:36.275 --> 38:37.526
But I knew.

38:38.569 --> 38:42.739
Everyone knew that she was a pillhead.

38:43.282 --> 38:45.868
I went there searching for drugs.

38:47.786 --> 38:48.954
In and out.

38:49.371 --> 38:50.414
That's it.

38:54.293 --> 38:57.045
I went straight to the medicine cabinet.

39:23.155 --> 39:27.492
My prints were found
because I went hunting.

39:35.834 --> 39:38.086
Josie, is that you?

39:39.171 --> 39:40.756
Go back to bed, Lanie.

39:49.598 --> 39:53.018
I got what I was looking for,
and I got out of there.

40:05.697 --> 40:09.243
So, you were there looking for drugs?
Nothing else?

40:09.326 --> 40:11.578
I told you I was hunting.

40:13.997 --> 40:16.792
Did you go "hunting"
the night of the murder?

40:22.798 --> 40:23.882
No.

40:27.845 --> 40:31.473
Remember when you told me
that men in here breathe to lie?

40:34.726 --> 40:37.020
I was a reporter for over 20 years.

40:37.104 --> 40:38.981
So I know a lie when I hear one too.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.692
You're not telling me the truth.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.945
Your mother has lung cancer.

40:45.028 --> 40:47.865
She was given six months to live
four months ago.

41:01.795 --> 41:04.214
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

41:09.094 --> 41:11.096
So will you help me get out of here?

41:17.811 --> 41:19.813
If you promise to tell me the truth.

41:23.025 --> 41:24.026
Deal.

41:27.487 --> 41:31.408
I just want to get something straight
before we start down this road.

41:33.160 --> 41:38.165
If you ever even breathe anything racist
in my direction,

41:38.248 --> 41:41.502
I will make sure you die in here
without ever seeing your mother again.

41:42.211 --> 41:43.420
Understand?

41:50.344 --> 41:51.929
I need to hear you say it.

41:53.764 --> 41:55.057
I understand.

41:56.558 --> 41:57.559
Okay.

42:01.897 --> 42:03.398
My name is Warren Cave.

42:03.482 --> 42:08.487
I live at San Quentin prison
where I was sent in the summer of 2000

42:08.570 --> 42:12.032
for the murder of my neighbor,
Chuck Buhrman.

42:13.867 --> 42:16.870
Every week I come to you,
and I bring you a story.

42:17.913 --> 42:19.206
I do interviews.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.542
None of them ever about me.

42:22.584 --> 42:24.002
This time it'll be different.

42:26.046 --> 42:29.091
-9-1-1, what's your emergency?
-I, I...

42:29.174 --> 42:31.802
-Hello?
-I, I don't know. I think--

42:31.885 --> 42:33.303
Ma'am, what's your emergency?

42:33.387 --> 42:35.472
He's dead, he's dead.

42:35.556 --> 42:38.225
Dad, no! Please. No.

42:40.018 --> 42:41.436
Nineteen years ago,

42:41.520 --> 42:44.189
prominent Bay Area author,
Chuck Buhrman, was murdered.

42:44.273 --> 42:46.608
...killed in his own home
while his wife and daughters slept--

42:46.692 --> 42:51.405
The focus quickly turned to the Buhrmans'
16-year-old neighbor, Warren Cave.

42:51.488 --> 42:52.489
The night of the murder,

42:52.573 --> 42:55.450
did you see the person
before they jumped the fence?

42:55.534 --> 42:56.743
I think so.

42:57.286 --> 42:58.745
I don't know why Lanie lied.

43:02.457 --> 43:03.792
And that's where I come in.

43:03.876 --> 43:09.339
Poppy Parnell portrayed me
as a privileged, entitled psychopath.

43:09.423 --> 43:13.677
I helped seal Warren's fate
with a series of articles called,

43:13.760 --> 43:15.512
"Profile of a Monster."

43:15.596 --> 43:17.222
We, the jury, being duly impaneled...

43:17.306 --> 43:20.767
Warren was sentenced to life in prison
without parole.

43:21.351 --> 43:24.938
Is there an innocent man in prison?

43:26.398 --> 43:30.110
And did I... lead that charge?

43:31.820 --> 43:37.492
My name is Poppy Parnell,
and I'd like you to reconsider.
