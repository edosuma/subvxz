00:12.303 --> 00:14.305
<i>- One thing</i>
<i>you come to understand</i>

00:14.347 --> 00:16.391
<i>about Northern Minnesota,</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:19.686
<i>from Lake Superior</i>
<i>to the Iron Range,</i>

00:19.728 --> 00:23.356
<i>water and ice have shaped</i>
<i>this land and its people</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:25.233
<i>for generations.</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:28.028
<i>Now, as for that Iron Range,</i>

00:28.069 --> 00:30.196
<i>it's an area filled with--</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:33.867
<i>well, I guess we spoiled it--</i>
<i>iron.</i>

00:33.908 --> 00:35.869
<i>Which is code for mining.</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:38.371
<i>It was originally settled</i>
<i>by the Scots,</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:42.000
<i>who instilled a few hallmarks</i>
<i>that still define life here--</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.836
<i>a tough, gritty work ethic</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:48.173
<i>and a game called curling.</i>

00:48.214 --> 00:51.801
<i>To this day, that's what</i>
<i>people do in the Iron Range.</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:54.971
<i>They work in mines,</i>
<i>and they curl.</i>

00:55.013 --> 00:59.100
<i>Meaning it's no surprise</i>
<i>that a town like Chisholm</i>

00:59.142 --> 01:00.977
<i>produced the best curler</i>

01:01.019 --> 01:04.647
<i>the United States of America</i>
<i>has ever seen.</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:11.321
<i>- Curling Club was built here</i>
<i>in Chisholm in about 1960.</i>

01:11.363 --> 01:15.492
I started curling with my dad
here in about 1967.

01:15.992 --> 01:19.162
<i>Curling, it's something</i>
<i>that gets handed down</i>

01:19.204 --> 01:22.040
<i>from generation</i>
<i>to generation, and, uh,</i>

01:22.082 --> 01:25.710
<i>there's a tradition</i>
<i>of good curlers in Chisholm.</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:28.630
<i>And that is it.</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:32.842
<i>The United States has won</i>
<i>curling gold at the Olympics.</i>

01:35.845 --> 01:38.473
<i>- There's a lot of pride</i>
<i>with John being from Chisholm</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:41.643
and his roots doing curling
being from Chisholm.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.938
<i>- John Shuster</i>
<i>is Chisholm's prodigal son,</i>

01:44.979 --> 01:48.775
<i>the hometown boy who struck</i>
<i>gold in South Korea</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:51.528
<i>and proudly</i>
<i>brought it back home...</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:55.240
<i>though the excitement</i>
<i>over the 2018 Olympic win</i>

01:55.281 --> 01:59.327
<i>for Shuster's team spread</i>
<i>far beyond Northern Minnesota.</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:00.745
<i>2018...</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:02.914
<i>- And they soaked up</i>
<i>the moment</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:05.083
<i>on their nationwide</i>
<i>victory lap.</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:06.668
<i>Let's do this, fellas!</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:09.004
<i>- It would not</i>
<i>surprise me a bit</i>

02:09.045 --> 02:11.131
<i>if they were to go</i>
<i>to another Olympics.</i>

02:11.172 --> 02:12.674
- The gold medal winning
curling team.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.384
Hey, guys.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.927
<i>- Chisholm's gonna be</i>
<i>watching John real close</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:17.679
<i>on this next one</i>
<i>and rooting for him,</i>

02:17.721 --> 02:20.557
and I'll be following
every game closely.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.060
<i>- John and the boys enjoyed</i>
<i>every bit</i>

02:24.102 --> 02:25.979
<i>of their flash of fame.</i>

02:26.021 --> 02:27.522
<i>But when it was all over,</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:30.150
<i>there was only</i>
<i>one place to go:</i>

02:30.191 --> 02:33.111
<i>back home to the Iron Range</i>

02:33.153 --> 02:36.322
<i>where the next goal</i>
<i>quickly came into focus:</i>

02:36.364 --> 02:38.533
<i>becoming the first</i>
<i>curling team ever</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:41.703
<i>to win back-to-back</i>
<i>Olympic gold.</i>

02:41.745 --> 02:44.456
<i>If it sounds improbable,</i>
<i>remember,</i>

02:44.497 --> 02:48.335
<i>they already</i>
<i>accomplished the impossible.</i>

03:14.152 --> 03:15.695
<i>We'll pick up our story</i>

03:15.737 --> 03:18.573
<i>a little more than three years</i>
<i>after PyeongChang</i>

03:18.615 --> 03:21.743
<i>and four months before</i>
<i>the next Olympic trials.</i>

03:21.785 --> 03:23.995
<i>For Team Shuster,</i>
<i>the clock is ticking,</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:26.915
<i>which means</i>
<i>the gym is beckoning.</i>

03:26.956 --> 03:30.126
<i>What, you didn't</i>
<i>think curlers cross-trained?</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:32.128
<i>Of course you didn't.</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:36.007
<i>Though the workouts actually</i>
<i>range from state-of-the-art</i>

03:36.049 --> 03:38.093
<i>to the old classics.</i>

03:38.134 --> 03:39.594
You're right here.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.389
- We have push-ups first.
Great.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.391
This is way too early
to be working out.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.477
- Is this 60 or 30?
- 60 seconds.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.938
- You can stop filming me
after 30 seconds.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.273
- We edit these tight,
boys, real tight.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.943
Give 'em two push-ups, and be
like, yeah, he's pretty fit.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.778
Set, go.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.906
Three, four--all the way down,
five, six--

03:59.948 --> 04:02.617
- Take your time.
Plenty of time.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.452
<i>- You take a look</i>
<i>at our team compared to</i>

04:04.494 --> 04:05.745
<i>these younger teams,</i>

04:05.787 --> 04:08.748
we're obviously
not as physically fit.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.333
- Come on, Landst.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.418
- You got it, buddy,
you got it.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.627
27.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.295
<i>I shouldn't even say this.</i>

04:14.337 --> 04:16.756
I think that I'm a nat--

04:16.798 --> 04:18.717
like a born-natural athlete.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.346
27, 8...

04:23.388 --> 04:24.973
28.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.725
Good.
Done!

04:26.766 --> 04:29.811
- Testing for me and testing
for my teammates, I think,

04:29.853 --> 04:32.647
I have a much different,
like, mindset toward it,

04:32.689 --> 04:35.025
where I kind of, like,
enjoy seeing what I can do.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.317
- 27...

04:36.359 --> 04:37.652
- Got to catch me.
- 28.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.154
- Yeah!

04:39.195 --> 04:40.155
- Yeah.
- Jeez.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.406
Whoo!

04:41.448 --> 04:43.324
Brutal.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.701
<i>I think some of my teammates--</i>

04:44.743 --> 04:46.119
<i>I don't think they get</i>
<i>the enjoyment out of it</i>

04:46.161 --> 04:48.496
<i>because they are</i>
<i>giving it their all,</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:50.373
<i>and it's not enjoyable.</i>

04:50.415 --> 04:54.544
- I--I hate
the physical testing.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.757
- Five, four, three,

04:58.798 --> 05:00.342
two, one.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.136
- 27, man.
- I had 48.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.929
I did not.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.896
<i>- In the gym, they embody</i>
<i>a range of profiles.</i>

05:12.937 --> 05:15.940
<i>And the same goes for their</i>
<i>personalities as well.</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:19.402
<i>- We have a very good balance</i>
<i>on our team,</i>

05:19.444 --> 05:21.696
<i>and it works very well.</i>

05:21.738 --> 05:24.824
My role is the quiet guy
slash introvert

05:24.866 --> 05:30.288
that kind of brings down the--
the energy in a good way.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.916
- You look really excited,
Steiner.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.210
I'm up.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.711
Attaboy, Shu!

05:36.753 --> 05:38.296
<i>- Matty's definitely</i>
<i>got a personality.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:40.507
<i>Like, it doesn't really matter</i>
<i>what kind of</i>

05:40.548 --> 05:42.258
<i>circumstances we're in.</i>

05:42.300 --> 05:43.802
- Attaboy.
Good job.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.013
- Matt's a good teammate, man.
He, uh...

05:47.055 --> 05:50.558
he's just kind of our guy for--
for the energy.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.185
- What are you doing?
Pull-ups?

05:52.227 --> 05:54.562
- Yeah.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.899
<i>- Chris, Chris is, uh--</i>

05:57.941 --> 06:00.068
calm, cool, and collected,
I would say.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.945
Man.

06:01.986 --> 06:05.323
<i>- Lotta people, uh,</i>
<i>know our team to be the--</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:08.410
<i>the gold medal team,</i>
<i>so we have a fresh guy,</i>

06:08.451 --> 06:10.829
and it's working out awesome.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.002
No wonder you can throw
a 4-1/2-second peel.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.920
My God!

06:18.962 --> 06:21.673
If you guys want to see
the worst vertical jumper

06:21.715 --> 06:23.425
in elite athlete history,

06:23.466 --> 06:25.176
you're looking
at him right now.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.762
Hey!

06:27.804 --> 06:29.597
John's just one of the, like,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.517
most ultra-competitive
dudes I've met.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.603
-
<i>- John's a gamer.</i>

06:35.645 --> 06:37.939
He's had the same
hunger...

06:37.981 --> 06:40.316
the entire time
I played with him.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.820
Got a lot to do, boys.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.697
Doesn't matter
about your score is.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.240
We win on the ice.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.127
<i>- You do know</i>
<i>that John Shuster</i>

06:59.169 --> 07:02.255
<i>isn't Chisholm's only</i>
<i>sporting legend, right?</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:04.007
<i>Because way back when,</i>

07:04.049 --> 07:06.009
<i>a baseball player</i>
<i>from the town</i>

07:06.051 --> 07:09.804
<i>famously reached the major</i>
<i>leagues for just one game.</i>

07:09.846 --> 07:12.307
<i>His name was Moonlight Graham.</i>

07:12.349 --> 07:15.185
<i>Shuster has lasted longer</i>
<i>on the ice</i>

07:15.226 --> 07:17.020
<i>than Graham did</i>
<i>on the diamond.</i>

07:17.062 --> 07:19.481
<i>But nearly a century apart,</i>

07:19.522 --> 07:22.150
<i>the stories of the two boys</i>
<i>from Chisholm</i>

07:22.192 --> 07:25.487
<i>each are tales</i>
<i>that epitomize the idea</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:28.865
<i>that hard work</i>
<i>has its rewards.</i>

07:28.907 --> 07:30.533
- All right, let's see it.
- Kick it!

07:30.575 --> 07:32.535
- Oh!
Save goalie.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.620
- Avery!
- Yeah.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.580
- Left-footed.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.624
Goal!

07:39.084 --> 07:41.294
Usually, I pull the shirt up
over my head and run around,

07:41.336 --> 07:44.964
but today I'm not feeling
quite so brave.

07:45.006 --> 07:49.052
<i>- Olympic superstar?</i>
<i>In the eyes of some, maybe.</i>

07:49.094 --> 07:52.806
<i>But this is Shuster</i>
<i>in his true natural habitat,</i>

07:52.847 --> 07:54.891
<i>with his family,</i>

07:54.933 --> 07:56.851
<i>a place where balance</i>
<i>and normalcy</i>

07:56.893 --> 07:59.229
<i>define a simpler life.</i>

07:59.270 --> 08:02.482
<i>And where, on this day,</i>
<i>sons Luke and Logan</i>

08:02.524 --> 08:05.694
<i>become just the latest</i>
<i>John Shuster opponents</i>

08:05.735 --> 08:07.237
<i>to meet defeat.</i>

08:07.278 --> 08:09.155
One time!

08:09.197 --> 08:12.033
<i>Life changed following</i>
<i>the 2018 games,</i>

08:12.075 --> 08:15.245
or yeah, I mean,
okay, superstar status.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.329
Good luck stopping Logan.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.455
<i>I think my kids now are--</i>

08:17.497 --> 08:19.416
<i>are getting old enough where--</i>

08:19.457 --> 08:21.584
where they realize how--

08:21.626 --> 08:22.752
how cool it is.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.379
Sorry, Logan, I tried.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.797
<i>You know, maybe they'll be</i>
<i>following in my footsteps</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:26.965
<i>and be doing</i>
<i>something similar,</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:29.801
but they have big dreams
ahead of them too.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.972
<i>I knew what curling was</i>

08:34.014 --> 08:35.640
<i>from probably</i>
<i>the time I could walk,</i>

08:35.682 --> 08:39.310
<i>'cause that was a sport</i>
<i>that my dad chose to play.</i>

08:39.352 --> 08:42.105
Lot of people, to pass,
you know, winters or whatever,

08:42.147 --> 08:44.024
you know, joined bowling
leagues or softball leagues,

08:44.065 --> 08:46.192
that kind of thing and, um,
and my dad happened

08:46.234 --> 08:49.320
to go and start playing
in curling leagues.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.865
<i>I always wanted to try</i>
<i>throwing a curling rock</i>

08:51.906 --> 08:53.950
<i>like my dad and his</i>
<i>friends did and, um,</i>

08:53.992 --> 08:55.744
<i>yeah, and I went</i>
<i>and tried it</i>

08:55.785 --> 08:59.247
<i>in March of my sixth grade</i>
<i>year of--of middle school,</i>

08:59.289 --> 09:02.208
and, uh, slid up on my toe
in this tuck slide,

09:02.250 --> 09:06.838
and slid a rock
down the ice and, um,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.298
you know, probably the fifth
or sixth time,

09:08.340 --> 09:10.008
I, you know,
hit the house and--

09:10.050 --> 09:11.968
and it was from that first time
that I knew it was gonna be

09:12.010 --> 09:13.928
something I wanted
to do long-term.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.308
<i>- So it was love</i>
<i>at first sight...</i>

09:18.350 --> 09:20.393
<i>even though,</i>
<i>like any good relationship,</i>

09:20.435 --> 09:23.688
<i>it took a lot of work for</i>
<i>Shuster to get to where he is</i>

09:23.730 --> 09:25.899
<i>at the top of the sport.</i>

09:25.940 --> 09:28.777
<i>From a bronze medal in 2006</i>

09:28.818 --> 09:33.156
<i>to dismal showings</i>
<i>in 2010 and 2014,</i>

09:33.198 --> 09:36.034
<i>and then finally gold</i>
<i>in PyeongChang.</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:38.912
<i>It's been a long</i>
<i>and winding road,</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:41.664
<i>all charted</i>
<i>in distinctive detail</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:43.958
<i>down in Shuster's basement.</i>

09:45.251 --> 09:46.628
- So like, that thing
I was telling you guys about

09:46.670 --> 09:48.254
is right here.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.090
We all had to make one of these
that were at this thing.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.299
There was, like, 100 of us,

09:51.341 --> 09:52.676
like, from a bunch
of different sports.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.387
And it was like how people,
like, leave fingerprints

09:55.428 --> 09:57.013
on whatever you're doing
kind of thing.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.640
And so we had
to draw this thing and--

09:58.682 --> 10:00.517
and yeah, and one of the things
I have on there was, like, a--

10:00.558 --> 10:04.312
a gold medal, and it's got
a turquoise colored ribbon,

10:04.354 --> 10:06.398
and a medal that has, like,
the exact same, like,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.191
markings as, like,
the PyeongChang medal,

10:08.233 --> 10:11.861
which blew my mind, like,
legitimately blew my mind.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.863
I drew that in 2005.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.490
"Everything happens
for a reason."

10:22.038 --> 10:23.331
All right, we're heading in.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.376
All right, buddy.
You got your mask?

10:26.418 --> 10:27.711
All right.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.046
<i>I think it would have</i>
<i>been probably, you know,</i>

10:30.088 --> 10:31.464
<i>easy to walk away</i>
<i>from the game,</i>

10:31.506 --> 10:33.717
<i>you know, after 2018.</i>

10:33.758 --> 10:35.343
<i>Kind of go out on top,</i>

10:35.385 --> 10:38.930
but I really love curling
and competing.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.226
Go.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.398
<i>My wife loves curling.</i>

10:48.440 --> 10:50.442
<i>I think she might like curling</i>
<i>more than I do.</i>

10:50.483 --> 10:52.861
- Mine are gonna fall out.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.362
- Mine were getting
really close.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.407
- I love watching curling,
and I love watching him curl.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.745
<i>There's no way else I'd like</i>
<i>to bring up my children</i>

11:01.786 --> 11:05.331
<i>than to let them see that</i>
<i>they can achieve their dreams</i>

11:05.373 --> 11:08.543
and that if they put everything
towards those goals

11:08.585 --> 11:11.421
and those dreams, that they can
do anything that they want.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.007
<i>- The fact that Sara</i>
<i>and my kids, you know,</i>

11:14.049 --> 11:16.176
<i>love, you know,</i>
<i>watching me compete as much</i>

11:16.217 --> 11:18.511
as I still love being
in the mix of competition,

11:18.553 --> 11:21.139
I think that's
a pretty good indicator

11:21.181 --> 11:23.224
that's it's something
I need to continue doing.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.061
- He's lucky, besides.
- I know.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.534
- Kick it.
'Cause I just gotta slice this.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.705
- Normally he's gone,
like, half the year,

11:45.747 --> 11:46.998
so I have to fend for myself,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.084
but with COVID,

11:49.125 --> 11:50.627
that was one perk,

11:50.669 --> 11:51.961
'cause he was home and bored,

11:52.003 --> 11:53.463
so he cooked all the time.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.591
- Yeah.
- Some pretty crazy stuff.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.051
I just do the baking.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.512
She's the baker.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.808
<i>- Matt Hamilton balances</i>
<i>the frozen ice in his life</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:06.559
<i>with a hot stove</i>

12:06.601 --> 12:09.813
<i>and quality time</i>
<i>with his wife Jen.</i>

12:09.854 --> 12:13.441
<i>The pair met through</i>
<i>a classically romantic,</i>

12:13.483 --> 12:16.444
<i>boy-meets-girl tale</i>
<i>they love to tell.</i>

12:16.486 --> 12:18.988
I met Jen in 2009.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.324
- We met...
- Over beer pong.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.577
- Playing beer pong
at a party downtown Madison.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.329
It was after a Badger game.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.290
- The deal was if he won that
I would come cheer for him.

12:29.332 --> 12:32.335
- Cheer on our team.
- So...

12:32.377 --> 12:36.214
- 12 years later--
- Still cheering on my team.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.592
This is the one.
You ready?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.096
- Ah!
- It was close.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.931
That was the distance.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.309
That was like that.

12:48.351 --> 12:51.938
<i>- It's a simple life,</i>
<i>and a far cry from the life</i>

12:51.980 --> 12:56.109
<i>of a viral star that he got</i>
<i>to know after PyeongChang.</i>

12:56.151 --> 12:59.529
<i>A star quality that even</i>
<i>attracted the attention</i>

12:59.571 --> 13:01.531
<i>of your humble narrator.</i>

13:01.573 --> 13:04.659
<i>Perhaps the irony</i>
<i>is that what makes him</i>

13:04.701 --> 13:08.455
<i>such a compelling character</i>
<i>is just how relatable he is.</i>

13:09.748 --> 13:11.249
<i>I'm an average dude.</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:12.792
<i>You know, they think</i>
<i>Olympians, and there's, like,</i>

13:12.834 --> 13:15.295
<i>this normal-looking dude</i>
<i>competing at the high level,</i>

13:15.337 --> 13:16.838
and they're like,
wow, that's pretty cool,

13:16.880 --> 13:18.590
like, I--
I wanna check this guy out.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.842
So maybe that's it.

13:20.884 --> 13:24.220
Maybe it's just my devilish
good looks, I don't know.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.892
<i>- Look what he used</i>
<i>for a ball marker there.</i>

13:28.933 --> 13:30.685
<i>- It could be--</i>
<i>- Gold medal.</i>

13:30.727 --> 13:33.104
<i>Oh, that is awesome.</i>

13:33.146 --> 13:34.647
<i>I love it.</i>

13:34.689 --> 13:37.442
<i>- Yet Matt made the most</i>
<i>of his moment,</i>

13:37.484 --> 13:40.070
<i>rubbing shoulders</i>
<i>with fellow superstars</i>

13:40.111 --> 13:42.447
<i>from all walks of celebrity</i>

13:42.489 --> 13:46.910
<i>and reveling in that ultimate</i>
<i>vision of modern fame--</i>

13:46.951 --> 13:48.912
<i>his own bobblehead.</i>

13:48.953 --> 13:51.289
<i>- I might never get to play</i>
<i>another Olympics again,</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:54.292
so I was certainly not
gonna let anyone else

13:54.334 --> 13:55.752
have more fun than me.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.925
Aw!
That's two that were so close!

14:05.762 --> 14:08.181
Mm.
Delicious.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.849
<i>Why do I want to go back</i>
<i>to the Olympics?</i>

14:09.891 --> 14:14.104
<i>Well, I mean, I just felt like</i>
<i>I just still loved curling.</i>

14:14.145 --> 14:16.231
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I'm ready to give up</i>

14:16.272 --> 14:18.149
<i>this, like, lifestyle.</i>

14:18.191 --> 14:19.984
<i>So I had a talk with the wife,</i>

14:20.026 --> 14:22.529
<i>and she's like, run it back.</i>

14:22.570 --> 14:24.531
<i>So here I am.</i>

14:25.907 --> 14:27.409
- Aw, I hit the top there.
- Whoa.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.841
Oof. I'm sprayin' 'em.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.594
Now everybody watching
is gonna judge my golf game.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.813
<i>- John Landsteiner,</i>
<i>Olympic gold medalist,</i>

14:56.855 --> 15:00.650
<i>amateur golfer, and I--</i>
<i>you know what?</i>

15:00.692 --> 15:03.236
<i>I think it's easier</i>
<i>if the guys explain it.</i>

15:04.738 --> 15:07.365
- If I can do that every time,
that'd be awesome.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.285
Describe John Landsteiner.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.041
<i>No, he's an awesome dude.</i>

15:16.082 --> 15:18.293
He's, uh,
he's kind of like our...

15:18.335 --> 15:20.128
our team rock, so to speak.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.130
He's just so even-keeled.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.843
<i>- John Landsteiner is--</i>

15:26.885 --> 15:28.511
I don't know, he's just--
he's just a cool dude.

15:28.553 --> 15:31.139
You--you know exactly
what you're getting.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.724
- Golf is, like,
good for curling

15:32.766 --> 15:36.686
because it's like
a mentally challenging game.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.272
John Landsteiner is...

15:39.314 --> 15:41.483
I mean, he's my longest
teammate of my career.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.401
<i>You know, he's kind of the--</i>

15:43.443 --> 15:45.487
<i>the business manager</i>
<i>of the four of us,</i>

15:45.528 --> 15:47.572
<i>and then, you know,</i>
<i>when we go to the ice,</i>

15:47.614 --> 15:49.074
<i>he's kind of the business</i>
<i>manager there too.</i>

15:49.115 --> 15:52.577
<i>And he's doing all the little</i>
<i>things that, you know,</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:54.579
<i>help and allow us all</i>
<i>to do our jobs.</i>

15:54.621 --> 15:58.583
<i>- When John Shuster began</i>
<i>putting his band back together</i>

15:58.625 --> 16:00.960
<i>for another gold medal run,</i>

16:01.002 --> 16:04.297
<i>there were no guarantees</i>
<i>anyone else would return.</i>

16:04.339 --> 16:06.758
<i>But Landsteiner</i>
<i>didn't hesitate.</i>

16:06.800 --> 16:09.928
- The motivation for making
the run for Beijing

16:09.969 --> 16:12.514
is we had other work
that we wanted to do,

16:12.555 --> 16:17.185
<i>and that's hard to pass up</i>
<i>on the opportunity to do.</i>

16:18.478 --> 16:19.437
Oh, boy.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.815
Oh, boy.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.031
<i>- Remember,</i>
<i>Chris Plys is a rookie,</i>

16:30.073 --> 16:31.950
<i>the one member of the team</i>

16:31.991 --> 16:35.537
<i>who wasn't part of the gold</i>
<i>medal run in Pyeongchang.</i>

16:35.578 --> 16:38.623
<i>But that gives him something</i>
<i>the others don't have:</i>

16:38.665 --> 16:41.459
<i>a hunger to get</i>
<i>where they've been.</i>

16:41.501 --> 16:43.586
<i>- People in the U.S.</i>
<i>like to cheer for winners.</i>

16:43.628 --> 16:45.505
<i>I mean, you don't get</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

16:45.547 --> 16:47.799
to join a defending Olympic
gold medal team

16:47.841 --> 16:49.592
very often, so...

16:49.634 --> 16:51.052
it just was an opportunity

16:51.094 --> 16:54.097
that doesn't come around
every day and couldn't pass up.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.269
<i>When I was younger,</i>

16:59.310 --> 17:01.312
I liked skateboarding
and snowboarding

17:01.354 --> 17:03.648
and doing all that kinda stuff.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.817
<i>I used to be angry person</i>
<i>on the ice.</i>

17:07.569 --> 17:09.696
Broke a lotta brooms, um,

17:09.738 --> 17:13.491
used to have a little bit
more of a mouth.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.993
<i>Just something I realized that</i>

17:15.035 --> 17:17.704
<i>even if I saw it as something</i>
<i>that was helping me,</i>

17:17.746 --> 17:20.248
<i>it may not have been</i>
<i>for the greater good,</i>

17:20.290 --> 17:22.334
<i>and so something</i>
<i>I had to work on.</i>

17:29.799 --> 17:31.509
<i>Whenever I'm home</i>
<i>from curling</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:33.011
<i>or if we're not working,</i>

17:33.053 --> 17:35.513
<i>it's usually out here</i>
<i>with the lady and the dogs</i>

17:35.555 --> 17:39.267
and trying to explore
new spots.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.436
<i>It's a good way</i>
<i>to just forget about</i>

17:41.478 --> 17:43.355
<i>all the busyness</i>
<i>of life back home</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:45.857
<i>with a job or stress.</i>

17:45.899 --> 17:48.735
<i>It's easy to let</i>
<i>all that stuff go out here.</i>

17:53.448 --> 17:56.576
<i>- Plys will tell you</i>
<i>he's mellowed some--</i>

17:56.618 --> 17:59.371
<i>personal growth</i>
<i>that served him well</i>

17:59.412 --> 18:01.915
<i>as the new guy</i>
<i>expected to perform</i>

18:01.956 --> 18:04.584
<i>like a defending</i>
<i>gold medalist.</i>

18:06.086 --> 18:08.004
<i>- It's definitely</i>
<i>a pressure cooker.</i>

18:08.046 --> 18:10.090
<i>I didn't wanna,</i>
<i>you know, come in</i>

18:10.131 --> 18:12.008
<i>and try and blow up</i>
<i>other team systems</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:13.968
<i>and all that kinda stuff,</i>
<i>so it took a little time</i>

18:14.010 --> 18:15.595
<i>to find my spot</i>

18:15.637 --> 18:17.555
<i>where I felt comfortable</i>
<i>going out on the ice</i>

18:17.597 --> 18:20.016
<i>every single time.</i>

18:20.058 --> 18:22.477
<i>Those guys have had</i>
<i>a lot more opportunity</i>

18:22.519 --> 18:24.145
<i>to play in like</i>
<i>those big games,</i>

18:24.187 --> 18:26.064
<i>so any big game that I get</i>
<i>a chance to play in,</i>

18:26.106 --> 18:27.857
<i>like I'm just stoked</i>
<i>to get on the ice,</i>

18:27.899 --> 18:30.443
and I just like to get
out there and compete.

18:31.236 --> 18:35.240
<i>- Last April, the journey</i>
<i>to the 2022 Olympics</i>

18:35.281 --> 18:38.910
<i>began with the World</i>
<i>Championships in Calgary.</i>

18:38.952 --> 18:42.789
<i>The revamped foursome needed</i>
<i>to get to the quarterfinals</i>

18:42.831 --> 18:45.083
<i>to earn the United States</i>
<i>a guaranteed spot</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:47.002
<i>at the Olympics--</i>

18:47.043 --> 18:50.505
<i>high stakes for which Plys</i>
<i>and his teammates</i>

18:50.547 --> 18:52.215
<i>looked more than ready.</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:55.635
- I've always prided myself
on being a shot maker.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.887
<i>I just kinda sit back</i>
<i>and make shots,</i>

18:57.929 --> 18:59.431
be there for the guys
when they need it,

18:59.472 --> 19:01.474
sweep hard.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.727
<i>- Look at this!</i>
<i>Doesn't get better than that.</i>

19:05.437 --> 19:06.896
<i>If you watch any game,</i>

19:06.938 --> 19:09.899
we were having the most fun
of any team on the ice.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.776
- Keep going straight.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.487
- Yeah!
<i>- That mojo that we've had</i>

19:14.529 --> 19:17.115
in the past was still there,
and it felt really good.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.783
Clean!

19:18.825 --> 19:21.119
<i>- Chris and the team's</i>
<i>impressive round robin</i>

19:21.161 --> 19:24.456
<i>earned them the spot</i>
<i>they needed in the quarters</i>

19:24.497 --> 19:26.916
<i>and looked to be</i>
<i>just the start</i>

19:26.958 --> 19:30.628
<i>of another frozen slide</i>
<i>to glory.</i>

19:30.670 --> 19:32.297
<i>- We were ready to play</i>
<i>anybody--</i>

19:32.339 --> 19:33.673
<i>didn't matter who came up.</i>

19:33.715 --> 19:35.550
<i>We all really felt like</i>
<i>we had a chance</i>

19:35.592 --> 19:38.053
to win that tournament.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.266
<i>- It was all setting up</i>
<i>perfectly...</i>

19:43.308 --> 19:45.393
<i>that is, until it wasn't.</i>

19:47.771 --> 19:50.398
<i>I got a knock on my door.</i>

19:50.440 --> 19:53.109
<i>There was just a lady</i>
<i>standing there.</i>

19:53.151 --> 19:55.695
<i>Just basically told me</i>
<i>that I had tested positive</i>

19:55.737 --> 19:59.616
for COVID the day prior
and that my tournament was over

19:59.657 --> 20:02.202
and I was gonna be
quarantined in Canada, um...

20:02.243 --> 20:04.412
for like the next ten days.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.706
Uh, wow, okay.
Sounds good.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.255
- I mean,
the World Championships

20:14.297 --> 20:15.674
was crazy this year.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.724
<i>The fact that positive tests</i>
<i>happened at the World,</i>

20:24.766 --> 20:27.102
<i>and one of them was our team</i>

20:27.143 --> 20:29.938
and it happened to be Chris,
uh, yeah.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.315
Little ironic.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.567
<i>- One of our coaches</i>
<i>is pounding on the door,</i>

20:34.609 --> 20:36.736
<i>and the last thing</i>
<i>we should be doing</i>

20:36.778 --> 20:38.405
is all congregating
in the hallway,

20:38.446 --> 20:39.906
but we're all just
freaking out.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.367
- And my coach calls me
individually.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.703
He's like,
"Hey, just so you know,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.622
like you need to be ready
to play third tomorrow."

20:47.664 --> 20:50.583
Okay. Like, I've always wanted
to try my hand at third,

20:50.625 --> 20:52.335
but maybe not at
the quarterfinals

20:52.377 --> 20:54.045
of the World Championships.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.172
- It was like a--
definitely a dark...

20:56.214 --> 20:58.675
put me--like mentally,
was in a dark spot

20:58.717 --> 21:01.553
that...that day
and that night.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.560
<i>I just figured</i>
<i>I was screwed</i>

21:08.601 --> 21:12.439
<i>and wasn't gonna get a chance</i>
<i>to play with the guys, and...</i>

21:12.480 --> 21:15.942
it was 45 minutes
before the game

21:15.984 --> 21:18.695
that I got a call from Phill
that was like, yo,

21:18.737 --> 21:19.988
you're gonna play, get ready.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.783
<i>- After a whirlwind</i>
<i>36 hours,</i>

21:23.825 --> 21:26.619
<i>Chris's test had been</i>
<i>deemed a false positive.</i>

21:26.661 --> 21:29.080
<i>He was eligible to play again,</i>

21:29.122 --> 21:31.791
<i>and the team wanted him</i>
<i>back on the ice...</i>

21:31.833 --> 21:34.210
<i>though there was</i>
<i>a slight catch.</i>

21:35.420 --> 21:37.130
<i>You can play with masks on,</i>

21:37.172 --> 21:38.506
<i>but that's the only way</i>
<i>we'll let you play.</i>

21:38.548 --> 21:40.133
We'll let Chris play,

21:40.175 --> 21:41.593
is if you go out
and play with masks.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.720
So we were like, yeah.

21:43.762 --> 21:45.847
Our best chance to win
is with Chris playing,

21:45.889 --> 21:48.308
'cause as much fun
as it would've been

21:48.350 --> 21:52.312
to try and play third,
I didn't really want to.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.106
<i>- Looks like</i>
<i>we're ready to go.</i>

21:55.148 --> 21:56.900
<i>- Trying to get ready</i>
<i>to play</i>

21:56.941 --> 21:59.527
<i>a world play-off game,</i>
<i>like in 45 minutes, was...</i>

21:59.569 --> 22:02.113
it was difficult but,
you know,

22:02.155 --> 22:04.741
the guys were there
and we gave 'em...

22:04.783 --> 22:06.951
we gave 'em
a really good fight.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.953
<i>- Great shot.</i>

22:08.995 --> 22:11.331
<i>USA will lead one nothing</i>

22:11.373 --> 22:13.833
<i>here after two ends.</i>

22:13.875 --> 22:15.752
<i>How mentally strong are we</i>

22:15.794 --> 22:17.837
<i>that we were able to, like,</i>
<i>go through this</i>

22:17.879 --> 22:20.382
emotional roller coaster
and then come out

22:20.423 --> 22:23.218
and put on an A-game against
another really great team.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.347
<i>- Couldn't walk it down</i>
<i>better than that.</i>

22:27.389 --> 22:30.141
<i>- Two wonderful shots</i>
<i>from Chris Plys.</i>

22:30.183 --> 22:31.976
- Chris was the best player
on the ice

22:32.018 --> 22:33.853
between either team
during that game.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.022
<i>- Yeah, he played</i>
<i>out of his mind,</i>

22:36.064 --> 22:37.774
<i>considering that situation,</i>

22:37.816 --> 22:40.068
and I think we all did.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.654
<i>- Very nice.</i>
- Good, John!

22:42.696 --> 22:44.531
<i>- That is a hard-fought 2</i>

22:44.572 --> 22:46.533
<i>for Team USA.</i>

22:46.574 --> 22:48.827
<i>U.S./Switzerland unfolded</i>

22:48.868 --> 22:51.162
<i>as an epic back and forth,</i>

22:51.204 --> 22:53.998
<i>and the match</i>
<i>hung in the balance</i>

22:54.040 --> 22:56.126
<i>as Shuster lined up</i>
<i>his final shot.</i>

22:56.167 --> 22:57.877
<i>- Final stone here</i>
<i>in end number ten</i>

22:57.919 --> 22:59.879
<i>for the Olympic champion.</i>

22:59.921 --> 23:02.090
- <i>Need something special.</i>
- Go, hard! Forget it.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.216
Forget it, guys.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.676
- Forget it.
- All right, all right.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.387
<i>That will not get it done,</i>

23:07.429 --> 23:09.723
<i>and this hard-fought battle</i>
<i>will be pulled out</i>

23:09.764 --> 23:13.226
- <i>by team Switzerland.</i>
- Continued good luck.

23:13.268 --> 23:16.730
<i>- It was an odd,</i>
<i>almost contradictory blend</i>

23:16.771 --> 23:19.315
<i>of satisfaction</i>
<i>and disappointment...</i>

23:19.357 --> 23:22.485
<i>mixed in with</i>
<i>the not-unimportant fact</i>

23:22.527 --> 23:25.780
<i>that they'd done what they</i>
<i>needed to get done.</i>

23:25.822 --> 23:28.324
<i>The U.S. had a spot</i>
<i>at the Olympics.</i>

23:30.535 --> 23:32.120
<i>And with the U.S. trials</i>

23:32.162 --> 23:33.955
<i>a little more</i>
<i>than six months away,</i>

23:33.997 --> 23:35.999
<i>maybe most important</i>

23:36.041 --> 23:38.710
<i>was something</i>
<i>that couldn't be quantified--</i>

23:38.752 --> 23:43.256
<i>the team's bond was as tightly</i>
<i>sealed as it'd ever been.</i>

23:43.298 --> 23:47.469
<i>No matter the field of play,</i>
<i>if this foursome was together,</i>

23:47.510 --> 23:50.889
<i>they were at least</i>
<i>gonna have some fun.</i>

23:50.930 --> 23:53.558
- The seventh handicap
on the hole

23:53.600 --> 23:55.477
leads with
a challenging tee shot

23:55.518 --> 23:56.853
along the driving range

23:56.895 --> 23:59.606
and an out-of-bounds line
along the left.

23:59.647 --> 24:02.067
Keeping a tee shot left will
give you a better approach

24:02.108 --> 24:04.110
into this makeable,
scorable green.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.653
- Mike, are you reading
something,

24:05.695 --> 24:07.947
- or is that like legitimate--
- That was just spit balling.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.033
- That's pretty fantastic,
Matthew.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.495
- Oh, that's going--
- And...breakfast.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.372
Breakfast balls.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.292
<i>- All good teams move forward</i>
<i>after defeats.</i>

24:19.334 --> 24:21.211
Mashed potatoes!

24:21.252 --> 24:24.756
<i>- They recover,</i>
<i>they decompress,</i>

24:24.798 --> 24:28.218
<i>and then they recharge.</i>

24:28.259 --> 24:29.427
Oh, get down.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.721
Our goal is to go back
to the Olympics

24:31.763 --> 24:34.391
to defend that gold medal
that those guys won.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.309
<i>So come Olympic trials,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

24:36.351 --> 24:39.312
<i>I can't think of many things</i>
<i>that could really top</i>

24:39.354 --> 24:41.147
<i>what was thrown at us</i>
<i>at the World's.</i>

24:41.189 --> 24:43.149
<i>so I think it'll put us</i>
<i>in a really great position,</i>

24:43.191 --> 24:46.069
you know, when we get to Omaha
in November.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.696
A real subtle putter.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.200
That's pretty sharp, right?

24:52.242 --> 24:54.911
- Aah!

24:56.871 --> 24:59.457
- Well, I'll get on the green.
<i>- The way that we have been</i>

24:59.499 --> 25:01.167
<i>around each other, and...</i>

25:01.209 --> 25:03.044
<i>I think it really just</i>
<i>prepared us to be</i>

25:03.086 --> 25:05.797
<i>as great of friends</i>
<i>as we've become now.</i>

25:05.839 --> 25:08.133
We're now enjoying
experiencing new things,

25:08.174 --> 25:09.884
you know,
together all the time.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.302
Oh, my gosh.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.680
<i>- And the next experience</i>
<i>that awaits--</i>

25:13.722 --> 25:15.557
<i>in November, in Omaha,</i>

25:15.598 --> 25:18.018
<i>is the Olympic trials,</i>

25:18.059 --> 25:20.020
<i>for which the most</i>
<i>important prep</i>

25:20.061 --> 25:22.147
<i>comes on frozen ground.</i>

25:30.030 --> 25:31.322
- Steiner, you animal!
- Curl!

25:33.491 --> 25:35.869
<i>Team Shuster 2.0</i>

25:35.910 --> 25:38.079
<i>may be a work in progress,</i>

25:38.121 --> 25:40.206
<i>but the whole point</i>
<i>of trying to win</i>

25:40.248 --> 25:41.958
<i>a second straight</i>
<i>gold medal</i>

25:42.000 --> 25:44.085
<i>is that it isn't</i>
<i>supposed to be easy...</i>

25:44.127 --> 25:46.046
<i>just the way they like it.</i>

25:46.087 --> 25:48.715
You are something.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.050
<i>It's the Olympic trials.</i>

25:50.091 --> 25:52.052
<i>I love playing</i>
<i>on a big stage</i>

25:52.093 --> 25:53.887
<i>and hopefully prove</i>
<i>that we're</i>

25:53.928 --> 25:56.681
still a top team
would be just...

25:56.723 --> 25:58.808
the bees' knees.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.393
We can edit that out in post.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.228
<i>- We have a lot of confidence</i>
<i>in our abilities,</i>

26:02.270 --> 26:04.064
<i>and we know that</i>
<i>if we come and play</i>

26:04.105 --> 26:05.732
<i>how we're capable of playing,</i>

26:05.774 --> 26:07.108
we have a great chance
at winning.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.234
Close!

26:08.276 --> 26:10.111
<i>To not really have</i>
<i>that pressure</i>

26:10.153 --> 26:11.863
of having to like go back
and wanting to repeat--

26:11.905 --> 26:13.573
my pressure is just
in wanting to get there.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.868
<i>It's just all business.</i>

26:16.910 --> 26:19.120
- Yep--switch switching goal!
Yep!

26:19.162 --> 26:21.081
<i>- So they might seem like</i>
<i>the favorites</i>

26:21.122 --> 26:22.874
<i>heading into trials,</i>

26:22.916 --> 26:27.128
<i>but time will tell if, when</i>
<i>you mix grit with grins...</i>

26:27.170 --> 26:29.047
- Okay, yep.
<i>- Balanced veterans</i>

26:29.089 --> 26:32.425
<i>with some new blood</i>
<i>and then add ice,</i>

26:32.467 --> 26:36.429
<i>you get the recipe</i>
<i>for another shot at gold.</i>

26:36.471 --> 26:37.931
<i>- I think the trials</i>
<i>are way more pressure</i>

26:37.972 --> 26:39.140
<i>than the Olympics.</i>

26:39.182 --> 26:41.893
There's so much...
so much on the line.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.645
That was pure, Shu.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.522
That's gold!

26:45.563 --> 26:47.774
Man, it makes me nervous

26:47.816 --> 26:50.235
just thinking about it.

26:51.695 --> 26:54.030
<i>- Next time,</i>
<i>on "American Rock Stars,"</i>

26:54.072 --> 26:55.407
<i>the trials.</i>

26:55.448 --> 26:57.575
<i>- For the nation's</i>
<i>top curlers,</i>

26:57.617 --> 26:59.869
<i>the road to Beijing</i>
<i>goes through Omaha.</i>

26:59.911 --> 27:02.622
<i>- Team Shuster starts</i>
<i>their ten-day trials journey</i>

27:02.664 --> 27:03.915
<i>as the team to beat.</i>

27:03.957 --> 27:05.500
Hard!

27:05.542 --> 27:06.668
Attaboy, Matty.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.962
<i>- But a collection</i>
<i>of upstart rivals</i>

27:09.004 --> 27:10.588
<i>calling themselves</i>
<i>The Young Bucks</i>

27:10.630 --> 27:12.632
<i>look to crash the ice party,</i>

27:12.674 --> 27:15.051
<i>hoping they can be the team</i>

27:15.093 --> 27:17.512
<i>that represents the U.S.</i>
<i>at the Olympics.</i>
