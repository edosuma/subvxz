WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.039
(Ray whoops)

00:05.073 --> 00:07.775
Here's to Nathan's mother
moving out!

00:07.808 --> 00:09.177
Oh!
(cheering, whooping)

00:09.210 --> 00:10.511
That's the bubbly.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.146
Now let's get
in trouble-y.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.782
Do you prefer
to be called Nate

00:14.815 --> 00:16.050
or Nathan?

00:16.084 --> 00:17.551
Um, well, either, I guess.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.552
Why?

00:18.586 --> 00:21.589
Because I want
to get it right

00:21.622 --> 00:23.657
when I'm screaming
your name in ecstasy.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.227
It says "Nathan"
on my passport.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.395
(laughs)

00:27.428 --> 00:29.397
* Sweet little Nathan

00:29.430 --> 00:32.066
* In your bed

00:32.100 --> 00:35.203
* Open your eyes
and lift your head *

00:35.236 --> 00:39.073
* All your dreams
will soon come true *

00:39.107 --> 00:43.244
* 'Cause Mommy's waiting here
for you *

00:43.277 --> 00:45.246
* Sweet little Nathan...

00:45.279 --> 00:46.380
(screams)

00:46.414 --> 00:48.416
No!

00:48.449 --> 00:50.718
Look, Mom, this has
got to stop, okay?

00:50.751 --> 00:53.121
We're not... we're not roommates
anymore; we're neighbors.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.688
And neighbors don't just barge

00:54.722 --> 00:56.157
into each other's apartments
and start singing.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.791
And they certainly don't go
into the fridge

00:57.825 --> 00:58.826
and cut all the grapes in half.

00:58.859 --> 01:02.296
Every 55 seconds,
a toddler chokes on a grape.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.497
Mom, I am a grown man.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.433
You got to stop
trying to take care of me.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.701
I'm sorry, I just didn't
want you to oversleep.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.370
Won't happen again.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.872
If you find a complete,
balanced breakfast downstairs,

01:11.905 --> 01:14.575
just know it was made
before we had this talk.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.777
Mom...

01:16.810 --> 01:18.246
Yes?

01:18.279 --> 01:20.881
You already started
singing the song.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.584
You don't finish it, it's gonna
be stuck in my head all day.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.153
* Sweet little Nathan

01:25.186 --> 01:26.787
* The day's begun

01:26.820 --> 01:28.256
* Let's start it out

01:28.289 --> 01:29.423
* With some tickle fun!

01:29.457 --> 01:30.224
(laughing)
Oh, Mom!

01:30.258 --> 01:32.760
(laughing):
Mom, no, come on...

01:57.718 --> 01:58.719
(coughing)

01:58.752 --> 01:59.787
(congested):
Oh, honey...

01:59.820 --> 02:01.189
I'm still sick.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.690
Are you okay to work
at the cafe by yourself?

02:02.723 --> 02:03.624
I can handle it.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.193
As long as both our customers
don't come in

02:05.226 --> 02:06.394
at the same time,
I'll be fine.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.166
Oh, man. Tom, are you still
on hold with customer service?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.402
Yeah, they think
I'll get bored and hang up,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.270
but they picked
the wrong retired guy

02:16.304 --> 02:18.206
with nothing to do.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.773
You know what I
did last Tuesday?

02:19.807 --> 02:20.641
I spent

02:20.674 --> 02:22.543
the whole day waiting
for a butterfly

02:22.576 --> 02:25.179
to emerge from a cocoon.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.681
Turned out it was nothing
but a rolled-up Band-Aid.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.819
Morning, everybody.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.222
Very big day
for me.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.257
Nate's got a big interview
with Metta World Peace.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.560
Wow, oh, my God, Nathan.
How exciting.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.395
So is that a person?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.497
Yes, he's a person.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.667
I'm... I'm interviewing him
about his new children's book.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.202
He's an NBA legend.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.437
Girls.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.239
Don't know anything
about football.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.408
All right.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.576
You ready to go, Mikayla?

02:55.609 --> 02:56.410
Yeah.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.479
I was hoping to wake up
with a cold

02:58.512 --> 03:00.581
so I could stay home, too,
but no luck.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.916
I guess I chewed on Mom's
toothbrush for nothing.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.985
All right.
Bye, sweetie.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.320
Bye.
Get some rest, okay?

03:06.354 --> 03:07.955
Okay.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.857
(not congested):
God, I thought
they would never leave.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.859
Okay, I'm not really sick.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.994
The cafe isn't bringing
any money in, so I've been

03:14.027 --> 03:15.629
secretly substitute-teaching
at the school,

03:15.663 --> 03:17.765
but please, please
don't tell Adam, okay?

03:17.798 --> 03:20.434
I don't want him to know that
I've lost faith in our business.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.870
Aw. That's cute.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.472
That you still call it
a business.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.642
Hey, you know,
Debbie's class

03:28.676 --> 03:29.843
would be the
perfect setting

03:29.877 --> 03:31.011
for the Metta World
Peace interview.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.713
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, yeah.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.315
We could... we could film him
reading his children's book

03:34.348 --> 03:35.316
to a room full of kids.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.617
Yeah, it's fine by me.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.851
Really? Oh, my God, thanks.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.953
And-and we promise
that you won't be on TV

03:39.987 --> 03:41.322
so Adam won't bust you.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.222
Oh, thanks.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.691
There's not much chance
of that, though.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.025
He's only watching
the Spanish channel

03:45.058 --> 03:46.994
now that he's trying
to learn the language.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.863
His favorite show is
El Seinfeld.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.866
It's a show about nada.

03:56.370 --> 03:59.507
You know, for a kid's book,
this thing is pretty deep.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.343
"I look into the mirror
and I like what I see.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.513
I am a person who's going to be
the best that I can be."

04:05.546 --> 04:06.414
That's how I feel.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.052
I finally know why
women love book clubs.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.254
Drinking.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.758
(knocking at door)
CAROL:
Nathan?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.293
Nathan,
are you home?

04:19.327 --> 04:20.628
Shh, it's my mom.

04:20.661 --> 04:21.795
Ever since she moved out,

04:21.829 --> 04:23.464
she's constantly trying
to take care of me.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.334
The other morning, I woke up
with a night guard in my mouth.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.768
And I don't even own
a night guard.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.370
Nathan, are you in there?

04:31.539 --> 04:33.006
You put a chain
on your door?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.708
I had to.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.009
God, I just...
She's got to learn

04:36.043 --> 04:37.745
that she can't
just barge in here.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.350
What the hell
are you doing?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.084
I'm sorry.
I heard a fire truck

04:44.117 --> 04:47.655
and I was worried you'd choked
on an uncut grape.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.059
Carol, there's a three-alarmer
down the block.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.327
There's firemen everywhere.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.795
I want to get
my calendar signed.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.829
Oh.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.334
Children's books?

05:00.368 --> 05:02.436
With words.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.672
Nathan...

05:04.705 --> 05:06.006
who's helping you
with these?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.978
See, this is another reason
that I wasn't letting you in.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.381
Because wherever you go,
this guy follows.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.916
There's Mom!
Here comes mini-Mom!

05:17.485 --> 05:19.019
You're being rude.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.388
Very rude.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.057
And I was just
trying to help.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.459
Look, I know you were.
I know.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.694
But you-you know what?

05:26.727 --> 05:28.095
You're never going
to grow as a person

05:28.128 --> 05:29.963
if you're so busy trying
to take care of me.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.064
So from now on,

05:31.098 --> 05:32.566
think of
this hallway

05:32.600 --> 05:34.067
as the U.S.-Mexico
border.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.869
You don't cross
without my permission

05:35.903 --> 05:37.671
and I won't come over
unless I'm drunk

05:37.705 --> 05:39.139
and looking to score
cheap medication.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.774
Okay?

05:40.808 --> 05:43.110
Adios, amigos!

05:43.143 --> 05:45.112
He's loco.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.548
Muy loco.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.383
Ray. Yeah.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.619
No, listen, sorry I'm late.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.855
Yes, I know that
the Metta interview is today.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.657
But I just... I overslept, okay?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.826
So just...
please don't tell my mother.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.761
Well, just
hurry up, man.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.663
Most of these kids think
I'm Metta World Peace.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.998
There you go.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.101
Stay in school.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.170
Okay, I'm on my way.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.105
Here, I'd like
to just

06:12.139 --> 06:14.141
put $50 on pump
number six.
Of course.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.476
As soon as I help
this little lollipop

06:15.509 --> 06:16.744
find herself a lollipop.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.111
Now, remember,
the flavor you pick

06:18.145 --> 06:19.813
says a lot
about you.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.849
For instance,
blueberry means you're sad.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.717
And cherry means
you're sassy.

06:23.751 --> 06:24.752
Can I just put
the $50 on pump six?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.487
Sir, I am trying to determine

06:26.520 --> 06:27.521
who this little girl is.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.491
She is at a very tender age
of self-discovery.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.159
So...

06:32.192 --> 06:34.662
I'm thinking
about... orange?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.430
CASHIER:
Well, don't rush into it.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.599
Have you tried
tangerine?
What's it like?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.734
It's a lot like orange.
You know what? This is enough.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.670
Time for the grown-ups to go
to work, so just, here.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.004
Take 'em all, on me.
There you go.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.138
Merry Christmas.
Happy birthday.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.173
Good luck at the dentist.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.877
Put whatever's left on
pump number six, okay?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.013
Check it out!
That's Metta World Peace!

06:54.181 --> 06:55.048
Daddy...

06:55.082 --> 06:57.485
that stranger right there
yelled at me

06:57.518 --> 06:58.786
and made me take all this candy.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.822
(laughs nervously)

07:10.263 --> 07:12.566
Why was he even
at that gas station?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.668
He's an NBA superstar.

07:14.702 --> 07:15.969
When he runs out of gas,

07:16.003 --> 07:17.871
shouldn't he just buy a new car?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.473
Nathan, calm down.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.307
Metta only saw you
for a second.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.742
He probably won't
even recognize you.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.243
(scoffs)
Nice try.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.112
This geometrically ideal
bone structure

07:25.145 --> 07:26.747
of mine is pretty unforgettable.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.516
What if we got
you a disguise?

07:28.549 --> 07:29.850
Hey, Debbie, you got
a lost-and-found box?

07:29.883 --> 07:31.652
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's over there.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.521
Maybe we should just...

07:33.554 --> 07:35.188
mess your hair up a little bit.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.190
Never, ever
touch my hair.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.192
I did not bring in
22 photos of Brian Williams

07:39.226 --> 07:41.028
to my barber to have
you mess it up.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.765
There's nothing
but scarves in here.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.966
Who buys a nine-year-old
a scarf?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.001
Obviously,
they're just gonna lose it!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.972
I got it.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.875
I'm gonna
borrow these.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.244
We'll Clark Kent you.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.212
(laughs) Ooh.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.514
Geek chic.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.582
(laughs)

08:01.615 --> 08:03.216
He's coming, he's coming!

08:03.250 --> 08:04.885
All right. Great.
Uh, start rolling.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.286
Maybe he'll be too busy
playing to the camera

08:06.319 --> 08:07.287
to even recognize me.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.589
Uh, Debbie...

08:08.622 --> 08:09.923
uh, you gotta distract
his daughter.

08:09.957 --> 08:10.924
I'm on it.
I'm on it.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.925
Okay.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.527
(clears throat)
Hi. Hi.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.228
Nice to meet you.
I'm the teacher, Debbie.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.229
Metta World Peace.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.230
This is my daughter,
Diamond.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.231
Oh, hi,
sweetie.
Hi.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.600
Why don't you, um,

08:19.633 --> 08:20.601
why don't you come stand
over here with me?

08:20.634 --> 08:23.303
Oh, my goodness,
what beautiful eyelids you have.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.006
Can you close you eyes so
I can get a better look at 'em?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.543
Hey, kids,
look who's here.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.645
It's NBA superstar
slash author

08:31.679 --> 08:34.114
slash ambassador of all things
calm and reasonable,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.315
Metta World Peace!

08:35.348 --> 08:38.151
Thank you.
It's an honor to be here with...

08:38.185 --> 08:40.287
So, uh, Metta, listen,
I really loved your book,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.155
uh, Metta World Peace
and Love Stories.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.291
I, um...
Have we met before?

08:44.324 --> 08:45.125
Oh, well, not unless
you volunteer at

08:45.158 --> 08:46.560
the Be Nice
to Children's Hospital,

08:46.594 --> 08:47.527
'cause I'm there all the time.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.229
Anyway, my favorite
part of your book was...

08:49.262 --> 08:50.297
Wait a second.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.033
Diamond, is this the man
who threw lollipops at you?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.202
That's him.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.037
He yelled at me and
his breath was stinky.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.573
Hey, I left the house quick
this morning, all right?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.841
And "yelled" is
a very strong...

09:00.874 --> 09:03.243
I just told her that orange and
tangerine were similar flavors.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.112
No, they're not.
They're wildly different.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.749
You've been feeding my daughter
lollipops and lies.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.885
Hey, I really didn't mean...

09:11.919 --> 09:13.654
Maybe you should see
what it feels like

09:13.687 --> 09:15.122
when someone bigger
makes you afraid.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.624
Listen,
Mr. Peace,

09:16.657 --> 09:18.726
the kids came here
to hear about your book,

09:18.759 --> 09:20.060
not to watch us fight.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.062
(chanting):
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

09:22.095 --> 09:23.597
Fight! Fight!
No, no, no, no, no.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.065
What makes you think
we're gonna fight?

09:25.098 --> 09:26.734
Maybe I'm just
gonna yell at you

09:26.767 --> 09:28.602
like you yelled at
my daughter Diamond.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.569
(grunts)
(children continue chanting)

09:30.904 --> 09:32.039
What's happening?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.106
Can't see anything!

09:33.140 --> 09:36.043
Why am I off the ground?

09:38.078 --> 09:41.081
I couldn't see anything
through those glasses.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.116
I thought that little girl
was a chair.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.753
And where were you, Ray?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.154
You're supposed to have my back.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.689
No, I told you I have your back

09:48.722 --> 09:50.958
for anyone under five-seven
and below 200 pounds.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.695
Great. I'll let you know

09:54.728 --> 09:56.830
if I ever get attacked
by Jason Alexander.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.165
Nathan...

09:58.198 --> 10:00.300
Nathan, I came over
as soon as I heard.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.301
What happened?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.936
As soon as you heard?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.104
How'd you hear anything?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.238
Well, I didn't hear anything.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.406
I put it together.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.075
I saw that
your car

10:08.108 --> 10:08.876
was parked crooked,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.711
so I knew you came home
agitated.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.312
And from the footprints
across the lawn,

10:12.345 --> 10:14.181
I could tell you were
in such a hurry

10:14.214 --> 10:15.849
that you didn't bother
with the sidewalk.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.384
I thought it was
a bathroom emergency,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.252
but then I didn't hear
a toilet flush.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.788
That's when I knew to come in!

10:20.821 --> 10:22.155
How can I help?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.124
It'd be a huge help
if you could figure out a way

10:24.157 --> 10:25.425
to keep my neighbor
from bothering me.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.727
Which one?

10:26.760 --> 10:27.594
That Saudi upstairs,

10:27.627 --> 10:29.763
or the other...
No, the Saudi is Italian

10:29.797 --> 10:31.665
and I'm talking about you!

10:33.166 --> 10:35.703
Uh, Nathan,
you better look at this.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.705
In strange news out of Virginia,

10:37.738 --> 10:39.873
it appears basketball star
Metta World Peace

10:39.907 --> 10:41.041
had quite a disagreement

10:41.074 --> 10:43.043
with local news reporter
Nathan Miller

10:43.076 --> 10:44.411
in an elementary school.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.013
You destroyed
the tape, right?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.214
Of course.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.716
Despite the chaos,

10:48.749 --> 10:49.850
some students managed to capture

10:49.883 --> 10:53.386
the act of stupidity and
cowardice on their cell phones.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.088
(children chanting)
Maybe I'll just yell at you

10:55.122 --> 10:56.389
like you yelled at
my daughter Diamond.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.457
What's happening?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.926
Can't see anything!

10:58.959 --> 11:00.728
Why am I off the ground?

11:00.761 --> 11:02.763
JULIE CHEN:
I mean, I don't know
about you guys,

11:02.796 --> 11:05.232
but as a mother, when I hear
of someone using a child

11:05.265 --> 11:07.467
as a human shield...

11:07.500 --> 11:10.403
I, for one, am against that.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.905
Moms, am I right?

11:11.939 --> 11:14.041
(cheering)

11:14.074 --> 11:16.744
Nathan, Nathan, Nathan.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.713
No, no, no! Not "main menu."
I didn't say "main menu"!

11:22.249 --> 11:24.417
Representative.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.686
(reporter speaking Spanish)

11:31.458 --> 11:33.961
¿Qué demonios?

11:37.798 --> 11:41.001
Sin mocos.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.436
JIM ROME:
Metta World Peace is one of
the most intimidating players

11:43.470 --> 11:45.105
in the history of the NBA.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.808
But we've finally found somebody
who could stop him:

11:47.841 --> 11:50.978
a coward holding
a nine-year-old girl.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.080
As a father myself,
I am impressed

11:53.113 --> 11:54.882
that Metta World Peace
didn't hit him.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.183
If it were me,

11:56.216 --> 11:59.787
I would've gone Metta World War
on Nathan Miller.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.222
(laughing hysterically)

12:02.255 --> 12:05.125
Metta World War!

12:05.158 --> 12:07.160
I love wordplay.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.464
It's on every channel
except Al Jazeera.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.233
Nope, there it is.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.269
Good to see those guys laughing.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.270
(chuckles)

12:17.304 --> 12:19.039
Okay, okay. Don't worry.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.841
Don't worry.
I can fix this.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.777
First, we need to get the phone
numbers of all those TV hosts,

12:23.811 --> 12:25.813
then lure them
into texting us pictures

12:25.846 --> 12:26.847
of their private parts...

12:26.880 --> 12:28.548
No, no, no, no, no!

12:28.581 --> 12:30.083
No!

12:30.117 --> 12:31.852
You're not doing that.

12:31.885 --> 12:32.820
You're not doing anything.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.155
The only thing I want you to do
is nothing.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.523
Understand?

12:36.556 --> 12:39.026
Listen, I understand
you don't want me coming over

12:39.059 --> 12:41.561
for the piddly stuff,
like waking you up on time

12:41.594 --> 12:43.997
or dumping out
your expired milk.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.866
But this is a big problem.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.534
And big problems are what
mothers have trained for

12:47.567 --> 12:48.936
their whole lives!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.538
I'm ready, son.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.773
Put me in.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.310
I'm not putting you in.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.579
No, no, no.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.181
I'm putting you out!

13:01.214 --> 13:04.017
I'm a grown man
and I do not need your help.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.552
Fine.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.221
You don't have to tell me
more than three separate times.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.223
You want to be on your own?

13:10.257 --> 13:11.992
You are on your own.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.560
Consider the cord...

13:13.593 --> 13:14.794
cut.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.065
Well, don't worry, man.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.299
This will all blow over

13:19.332 --> 13:21.534
when the next, bigger story
knocks it off the front page.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.603
I'm sure there's some celebrity
who's about to go into rehab.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.005
(Ray chuckling)

13:25.038 --> 13:26.339
Watch.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.842
Where's
Entertainment Tonight at?

13:28.876 --> 13:31.879
It may seem like a scene
from the newest Taken sequel,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.581
but even Liam Neeson
couldn't save this little girl.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.184
I have to warn you,
this clip is rated "R"

13:37.217 --> 13:39.419
for "Really, Nathan Miller?"

13:45.959 --> 13:47.928
Welcome back.
Tony Kornheiser with you,

13:47.961 --> 13:49.396
and there's a lot
of hoo-ha going on

13:49.429 --> 13:51.364
about local newscaster
Nathan Miller.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.465
So let's go to the phones.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.267
Bill in Arlington.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.402
Yeah, how you doing, Tony?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.437
Uh, I just gotta
say, I think that

13:57.470 --> 13:58.939
that Nathan Miller's
a real hero.

13:58.972 --> 13:59.973
You know?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.875
I think if you-- if you look
at that classroom,

14:01.909 --> 14:04.878
that, uh, that terrarium looks
like it's... like it's broken.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.247
Matter of fact, uh,
I think that, uh,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.282
that floor might be
covered in scorpions.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.385
Bill, you're a dope.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.586
Hey, listen, Tony, let me...

14:13.620 --> 14:15.088
Oh, God,
I think he hung up on me.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.657
What's wrong with the...
All right, we've got all
their other lines tied up?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.459
Yeah, I got a whole roll
of fake callers here,

14:19.492 --> 14:20.293
ready to defend you.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.429
How are you
with foreign accents?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.596
Well...

14:23.630 --> 14:25.065
TONY:
Let's go back to the phones.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.066
This is interesting.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.434
We have Colleen on the line...

14:27.467 --> 14:29.903
all the way from Ireland?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.405
A woman
from Ireland?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.908
I hope you ate
your Lucky Charms this morning.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.045
(bad Irish accent):
Top o' the morning to you, Tony.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.049
NATHAN (Irish accent):
...and it takes quite
the upper body strength

14:42.082 --> 14:44.184
to lift a wee child
with only your arms.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.453
I should know. I've got 11.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.388
Children, not arms.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.656
(coughing)

14:53.093 --> 14:54.294
(congested):
Oh, honey...

14:54.327 --> 14:56.396
I'm so sorry,
I just feel worse than ever.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.397
Mmm.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.999
Poor baby. Still sick, huh?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.333
That bug has
really got you down.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.635
Yeah. Just can't seem
to shake it.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.636
Well, don't worry.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.672
I have just the thing
to make you feel better.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.640
It's Mikayla's old snot sucker
from when she was a baby.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.642
Yeah, just shove
this in your nose

15:09.676 --> 15:11.278
and I'll suck the sickness
right out of you.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.712
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't think we need to...

15:12.745 --> 15:14.481
I mean, I think we just
need to give the medicine

15:14.514 --> 15:15.482
a chance to do its work.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.649
No, no, don't be silly.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.018
You're sick.
Just tilt your head back.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.452
Oh, no, no. I think it's more

15:19.486 --> 15:21.121
congestion than snot. I...
Oop, there we go.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.661
Ah, I know
you're not sick!

15:28.695 --> 15:31.498
I saw you on la televisión.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.366
What were you doing
down at that school?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.467
I was subbing, okay?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.003
We needed to pay the bills.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.170
I didn't want you to think

15:37.204 --> 15:38.438
that I'd given up on the cafe.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.539
Wait.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.640
You've given up on the cafe?
No.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.675
Maybe.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.544
I don't know.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.645
Okay, would it help
your decision

15:45.678 --> 15:48.248
if I told you that I gave up
on it a long time ago?

15:48.281 --> 15:49.616
Wait, you did?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.251
Yeah. (sighs)

15:51.284 --> 15:53.486
Even my fake Yelp review
for the cafe

15:53.520 --> 15:54.721
only gave us two stars.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.391
Wait, are... are you saying
what I think you are?

15:58.425 --> 15:59.626
(sighs)

15:59.659 --> 16:01.128
Let's do what
the health inspector's

16:01.161 --> 16:02.462
been trying to do for years.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.596
Let's close down the cafe.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.464
Oh, hon...

16:04.497 --> 16:06.166
Hello?

16:06.199 --> 16:07.567
They finally
picked up.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.403
Yes, my name is Tom Miller,

16:10.437 --> 16:12.705
and I have been on hold
since Thursday.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.244
I called because you asked
if I wanted to be part

16:17.277 --> 16:19.146
of a customer survey.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.580
Well, I wanted to tell you

16:20.613 --> 16:22.482
that I do not.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.489
Metta.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.624
Hey, listen, if this is about
those callers on the radio,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.793
I have no idea

16:33.826 --> 16:36.596
what those people with amazing
accents were talking about.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.431
I like a little

16:38.465 --> 16:39.699
whiskey in my coffee, too.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.434
(laughing)
Oh, Nathan, you're home.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.104
Now, l-listen.
I-I-I know

16:44.137 --> 16:45.572
I told you I wouldn't
interfere again,

16:45.605 --> 16:47.507
but I couldn't
help myself.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.109
This was just too big.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.343
Hello.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.478
I'm Metta's mother.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.246
Carol was kind enough
to track me down

16:53.280 --> 16:55.448
at the hotel and tell
me what was going on.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.616
My instincts told me

16:56.649 --> 16:58.751
Metta's a man who travels
with his mother.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.355
Nathan, sit down.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.390
You, too, Metta.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.226
Sit down.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.231
I came to apologize for my son.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.565
But, Mom...

17:12.599 --> 17:14.067
he yelled at Diamond.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.502
I know what he did,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.170
but two wrongs
don't make a right.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.606
Now, we're gonna
set things straight

17:19.639 --> 17:21.274
with this Brian Williams
wannabe.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.575
Oh, gosh, thank you.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.610
(laughs)

17:25.578 --> 17:27.614
You know how intimidating
you can be,

17:27.647 --> 17:29.749
especially with someone smaller,

17:29.782 --> 17:31.551
weaker, less successful...

17:31.584 --> 17:32.619
He gets it. He's good.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.586
And you.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.622
Who do you think you are,
yelling at a child?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.590
A Russian gymnastics coach?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.860
You both need to sit here
until you've worked this out.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.861
METTA'S MOTHER:
Mm-hmm.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.430
And you, Carol, need to put

17:43.463 --> 17:44.397
some more whiskey in this mug.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.433
Girl, it's starting
to taste like coffee.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.336
I'm sorry, I didn't
know you well enough

17:49.369 --> 17:51.504
to give you
a Carol pour.
(laughs)

17:51.538 --> 17:53.540
Mothers, huh?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.675
Tell me about it.
Mine lives across the hall.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.676
Yeah?

17:56.709 --> 17:57.577
At least you can move.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.446
I bought my mother
the house next door.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.182
She's not going anywhere.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.083
You're looking at
Everybody Loves Metta.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.753
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other day.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.189
I... I was just really
stressed out about being late

18:09.222 --> 18:10.623
and you're the biggest
interview of my life,

18:10.657 --> 18:13.393
but I... I shouldn't have
yelled at your daughter.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.561
Ah, it's all right.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.628
She should've just
picked a lollipop.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.565
Indecision runs in my family.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.233
That's why I keep
changing my name.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.268
(chuckles)

18:22.902 --> 18:24.671
I'm just worried
my career's over.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.706
And if people think
I can't control my temper,

18:26.739 --> 18:29.342
nobody's gonna buy
my children's books.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.511
I've never wanted to be
the next Dr. J.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.513
I've always wanted to be
the next Dr. Seuss.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.716
I'd rather write.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.351
Write all night.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.786
To write all night

18:39.819 --> 18:41.921
would be such a delight.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.490
That's pretty good.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.925
You know, I-I think that if...

18:45.958 --> 18:47.527
if we work together,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.629
there just might be
a way out of this.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.168
So what you're
telling America

18:55.202 --> 18:57.537
is that this whole thing
was a staged prank?

18:57.570 --> 18:58.771
Brilliant, right, James?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.573
Yeah, it was actually
all Metta's idea.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.809
And all I had to do
was act scared.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.578
Emma did a great job
as our human shield.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.714
His big head
stretched out my glasses.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.781
Okay.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.717
(chuckles)

19:10.750 --> 19:12.552
I knew this video
would go viral

19:12.585 --> 19:14.287
and bring attention to
the issue of bullying.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.655
It's no good, kids.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.457
That's why we're all better off

19:17.490 --> 19:19.292
choosing World Peace

19:19.326 --> 19:21.528
and Love Stories.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.363
Well, you fooled us.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.865
Now back to the crisis in Syria.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.200
Guys... we did it!

19:27.234 --> 19:28.701
You had nothing
to do with it, Kip.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.870
The three of us have
a fun time, don't we?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.639
CAROL:
I'm just glad

19:32.672 --> 19:33.440
it all worked out.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.209
And I promise,
this is the last time

19:36.243 --> 19:37.644
I will ever
interfere.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.680
Well, Mom, that is...

19:40.713 --> 19:42.215
a promise that you cannot keep.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.619
And also one that
I don't want you to make,

19:46.653 --> 19:48.388
'cause you know what?
I was wrong.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.589
Without you finding Metta's mom,

19:49.622 --> 19:50.857
there's no way
I would've figured out

19:50.890 --> 19:52.392
a way out of this, so...

19:52.425 --> 19:54.861
as much as I hate to admit it...

19:54.894 --> 19:56.696
I do sometimes need your help.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.565
Thank you.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.267
And I'm sure you've
had a long day

20:00.300 --> 20:01.401
and you're ready for bed.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.835
I am very tired.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.671
* Sweet little Nathan

20:04.704 --> 20:06.506
* Your day is done

20:06.539 --> 20:10.677
* Close your eyes,
my precious one *

20:10.710 --> 20:14.447
* As Mommy lays
in bed with you *

20:14.481 --> 20:16.015
* The world shrinks down

20:16.048 --> 20:17.884
* To just us two...
Three.
