WEBVTT

00:06.474 --> 00:08.240
The shift has barely started

00:08.242 --> 00:10.409
and I'm already
sweating my butt off.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.212
You hit the gym?
I tried, but the lot was full.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.347
Some jackass in a BMW
parked crooked

00:15.349 --> 00:17.349
and took the last two spaces.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.085
I had to park on the street
and walk in this humidity.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.087
Look, it's not my fault
those spaces are so small.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.689
You know, it's like
you have to drive a Prius

00:23.691 --> 00:25.457
in order to be able
to get out of your car.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.262
Wait a minute. You drive a BMW?
<i>That</i> BMW?

00:30.264 --> 00:32.363
Well, maybe if you got here
a bit earlier,

00:32.366 --> 00:34.400
you'd get a better space.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.435
Interns should be the first
to arrive and the last to leave,

00:36.437 --> 00:37.770
in my humble opinion.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.072
Oh, my god.
You are so annoying.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.508
Hey, you know what?
Get along.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.529
Don't make me separate
the two of you.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.347
Hey, Scott.
Um, do you have a minute?

00:48.349 --> 00:50.416
What's up?

00:50.418 --> 00:52.418
Um...

00:52.420 --> 00:55.120
I wanted to apologize to you
for what I said about Annie.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.673
You know what?

00:57.674 --> 01:00.225
Let's keep our personal and our
professional matters separate.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.627
It's better that way.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.468
Whoa.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.770
You look like you just went
five rounds with Nate Diaz.

01:11.772 --> 01:15.641
It's worse. Kenny's crushing me
with this training.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.708
Why don't you join us?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.477
I'll let you two play together.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.179
So, uh, Kenny's new
physical regimen

01:20.181 --> 01:21.713
is really working out, huh?
It's unbelievable.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.248
No more panting up stairs

01:23.250 --> 01:25.184
or back pain picking up
the twins.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.086
I feel great, 10 years younger.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.121
Yeah, too bad you don't
look the part.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.538 --> 01:46.271
You gotta see this.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.141
I surprised Riley at school
when I got back.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.409
Watch her freak out.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.716
We both cried like babies.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.185
Well, yeah, you know,
I'm gonna cry.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.255
I love these parent-soldier
reunions.

02:03.257 --> 02:06.258
Hey, mom, can I spend the night
at Elise's house tonight?

02:06.260 --> 02:07.559
We'll talk about it later.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.429
But, mom...
After the fireworks.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.365
- You got it?
- Got it.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.900
You know I love you.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.502
I love you, too, mom.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.838
Hold on, just a second.
Let me straighten your ribbon.

02:21.909 --> 02:25.577
So, how's it been, coming back?

02:25.579 --> 02:29.681
I'm just trying to get
into the flow again with Riley.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.251
You know, I feel like
I've missed so much.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.320
And I can't thank you enough
for all you've done for her.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.389
Least I can do.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.924
And we've been having
a ton of fun.

02:38.926 --> 02:43.529
Anyway, I just... I know she's
happy you're back, and so am I.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.732
Well, I'm not so sure
her father is.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.300
He's gotten accustomed

02:48.302 --> 02:50.602
to having his own way
in my absence, and, uh...

02:50.604 --> 02:51.803
But that's not the way
it works, right?

02:51.805 --> 02:54.373
I mean, you both get a say.

02:56.944 --> 03:00.379
That's early.
Yeah, it's very early.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.520
Riley!

03:08.522 --> 03:11.490
Riley!

03:14.228 --> 03:15.794
Hey. Have you, uh,
have you seen Paul?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.696
Thankfully, no.
You need something?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.931
Only his company

03:18.933 --> 03:22.334
for the spurs-warriors game
tomorrow afternoon.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.536
One of my clients at the gym
gave me front row seats.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.473
Well, maybe his chauffeur can
drive you there in his Beemer.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.342
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.244
Easy, old-timer. You lost?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.713
I'm not lost.
This the ER, ain't it?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.349
Okay, calm down.
What's your name?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.917
Harold. Everything hurts.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.519
Where does it hurt, Harold?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.487
In my knee, in my chest,
in my head.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.424
I just need something
to make the pain go away.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.793
I've heard that one before. Let
me show you to our waiting room.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.228
But I can't wait!

03:49.230 --> 03:51.263
I know.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.497
Man.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.299
You okay, man?

03:54.301 --> 03:57.669
I just told you,
it hurts all over.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.671
I just...

03:59.673 --> 04:03.408
I just need to sit down
for a second and rest.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.711
We'll take care of you,
okay, Harold?

04:05.713 --> 04:07.412
Take him to exam 1, please.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.184
All right, look,

04:12.185 --> 04:13.751
he's probably just looking
to score some drugs and grub,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.554
so treat him quick
and move him out.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.656
Listen up, people!

04:17.658 --> 04:20.492
We have a fireworks fiasco
out at Woodlawn park.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.894
9-1-1 operator says
it's an active situation.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.080
Expect casualties.

04:25.081 --> 04:27.265
Uh, drew's out there.
I'm sure he's already helping.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.534
Jordan, you're in charge.
T.C., you're coming with me.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.503
Chopper will have us there
in 10 minutes.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.538
I'll call the pilot.
I already did.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.811
Riley!

04:39.813 --> 04:41.513
Riley!
Riley!

04:41.515 --> 04:43.415
Riley, where are you?!

04:46.287 --> 04:48.987
Riley!
Riley!

04:50.958 --> 04:53.659
She went that way!
I'm right behind you.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.560
Riley!

04:55.562 --> 04:57.062
Riley!

05:00.768 --> 05:02.601
Drew.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.940
Riley!

05:08.942 --> 05:11.677
Riley!

05:29.797 --> 05:31.096
Riley!

05:31.098 --> 05:32.798
Riley, where are you?!

05:32.800 --> 05:35.367
Riley! Riley!

05:35.369 --> 05:37.436
Mom! Drew!

05:37.438 --> 05:38.704
Riley!

05:38.706 --> 05:40.505
Mom!

05:40.507 --> 05:42.708
My god.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.076
You okay?
I'm fine.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.410
Let's see.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.979
I'm fine.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.915
Hey, you all right?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.817
Help!

05:53.020 --> 05:55.020
Help!

05:56.523 --> 05:58.357
You stay right behind me,

05:58.359 --> 06:00.726
and I mean <i> literally</i>
right behind me. Okay.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.694
Someone help my daughter!

06:02.696 --> 06:03.929
Please, help my daughter.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.364
I'll get the girl,
you get the mom.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.698
Okay.
Just sit down.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.400
I'm Dr. Alister.
What's your name?

06:08.402 --> 06:09.835
- Riley?
- Linda.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.670
Are you okay? I want you to
breathe through the scarf.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.504
Please help my daughter.
She's in good hands, okay?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.374
Just focus on me.
It's okay, sweetie.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.142
Just wait for
me right there, okay?

06:17.144 --> 06:20.112
Ah! Darika.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.147
Let me check your back.
My name is Dr. Jennings.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.849
What's your name, sweetie?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.384
Darika.
Darika.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.485
You hang in there.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.420
All right, I'm gonna
take care of you.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.788
Everything's gonna be all right.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.390
Promise?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.628
I dig the ink on your hand.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.930
Where'd you get it?
It looks familiar.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.099
Oh, that's been around
for thousands of years.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.568
I'm more interested
in the last few.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.571
That's a tag for a street artist
named yo-yo.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.141
You know his work?
Intimately.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.176
I knew it. You're him.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.711
Hey, just, shh.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.980
Your secret's safe with me,
yo-yo.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.853
How long has this been swollen?

07:01.855 --> 07:03.188
About a week, maybe.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.589
Mm.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.191
Aah!

07:06.193 --> 07:07.759
Ow!

07:07.761 --> 07:10.495
Is everything all right, doc?

07:10.497 --> 07:12.731
We're gonna need to run
a few more tests.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.166
Hey.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.002
So what's up
with Mr. total body pain?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.703
Can we discharge him?
No, he's got a swollen knee.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.355
I'm gonna need to tap the joint.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.006
We got multiple incoming coming
from the firework accident,

07:22.009 --> 07:23.575
and you want to work with a guy
with arthritis?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.577
It could be a septic joint.
Do me a favor.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.512
Give him a Motrin,
refer him to a walk-in clinic,

07:27.514 --> 07:29.781
and send him on his way.
I'm begging you.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.594
That's our chopper.
Help should be here soon.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.663
How you doing, Riley?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.498
Ri, how are you?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.133
I'm... I'm fine.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.168
It's not much longer, okay?

07:50.170 --> 07:53.171
Syd? We're gonna be right back.
Just stay here.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.441
Okay, from what I can tell,

07:56.442 --> 07:58.175
she's got full thickness burns
on her upper torso and arm.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.612
Girl has multiple penetrating
wounds to her neck and her face.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.813
I'm worried about her airway.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.482
- Okay.
- Drew!

08:03.484 --> 08:05.217
Hey! Hey! Over here!

08:05.219 --> 08:07.085
Drew!
This way.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.221
Uh, Dr. Topher Zia,
Dr. T.C. Callahan

08:09.223 --> 08:10.222
from my hospital.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.556
This is Dr. Syd Jennings,

08:11.558 --> 08:12.791
the orthopedist I worked with
at Bagram.

08:12.793 --> 08:13.959
It's a pleasure.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.193
Heard good things.
What happened?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.028
Fireworks meant for the end
of the concert

08:17.030 --> 08:18.296
went haywire in the middle.

08:18.297 --> 08:19.563
Got lots of potential
blast injuries.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.199
You guys, take your patients,
we'll stay.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.667
Chopper's right over the hill.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.269
Send it right back when you land.
Okay, great.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.271
Uh, hey, wait a minute.
What about Syd?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.106
She doesn't have privileges.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.575
Privileged.
I'll e-mail the board. Just go.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.277
Topher, we need to set up
a triage.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.913
Okay, you set it up. I'll start
herding patients your way.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.289
Hey, Paul?

08:44.291 --> 08:47.025
I need your help
tapping a patient's knee.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.561
Uh, you... you need...
You need <i> my</i> help?

08:49.563 --> 08:50.962
Like... like, Paul Cummings?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.264
Are you gonna do it or not?

08:52.266 --> 08:55.100
Sure. It certainly seems like
you need me.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.235
Yo, Paul, courtside seats
for the splash brothers

08:57.237 --> 08:58.970
tomorrow afternoon.
You down?

08:58.972 --> 09:01.139
I-I'm working.
Get somebody to cover it.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.008
I'm sorry, I-i can't.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.570
I'm already covering
for somebody. Um...

09:08.315 --> 09:10.715
I thought he would've jumped
on those tickets.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.884
Man, how would anyone not want
to go to this game?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.553
You just need to find someone

09:14.555 --> 09:16.855
who's not working tomorrow
and loves basketball.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.690
Yeah, that shouldn't be
too hard, should it?

09:18.692 --> 09:21.326
I'll find somebody.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.701
All right, listen up!
Everyone remain calm.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.970
Everyone will be treated.
More help's on the way.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.705
Okay, just hold this
against your eye

09:33.707 --> 09:36.041
until we get to the ER, okay?
Am I gonna lose my eye?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.309
Not if you don't move it,
all right?

09:37.311 --> 09:38.643
Thanks, brother.
Next.

09:38.645 --> 09:39.778
You gotta get these people back!

09:39.780 --> 09:41.680
There's more fireworks
on the truck

09:41.682 --> 09:44.649
and they could blow any second!
Hey, hey, hey! Pipe down, okay?

09:44.651 --> 09:46.284
Otherwise, people are gonna
stampede in a panic,

09:46.286 --> 09:47.652
we'll have more injuries.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.019
How do you know
there's more fireworks?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.822
I was hired to tote
the pyro engineer's payload.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.058
The rest is in my trailer.
Where's your truck?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.694
Same place I told the other doc.
Which doc?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.062
Wiry Asian fella.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.296
I told him the pyro guy

09:58.298 --> 10:00.065
had the fireworks set up
east coast time,

10:00.067 --> 10:02.601
they went off early,
before they were ready.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.868
Which way?

10:03.870 --> 10:06.137
On the hill, right over there.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.878
Toph! Get back!

10:25.092 --> 10:26.825
Topher!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.893
Topher! Topher!

10:35.402 --> 10:37.402
Toph!

10:37.404 --> 10:40.171
Hey, Toph? Hey.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.240
You good?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.642
Huh? Huh?

10:43.644 --> 10:45.710
Yeah. Yeah.
Good. I'm good.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.246
My ass you're good.
I'd slap you myself

10:48.248 --> 10:49.981
if you hadn't already
had your bell rung.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.250
How stupid can you be, huh?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.193
His pulse is weak.
We gotta stop the bleeding.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.864
Toph, tie off his arm.
I got his gut.

11:10.704 --> 11:11.936
Okay. All right?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.888
I'm good. I'm good.
Got it.

11:13.889 --> 11:16.289
You sure? Take care of your business.
I'll take care of mine.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.016
We have to prep him for exfil.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.418
He's lost a lot of blood.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.154
He tried to save others.
We can do the same for him.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.222
He goes.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.325
Little help! This is
Dr. Alexander, ER attending,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.161
Dr. Clemmens,
head trauma surgeon.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.613
This is Dr. Syd Jennings,

11:37.614 --> 11:39.064
the orthopod
I worked with overseas.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.166
Topher has blessed her off,
so she's got privileges.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.034
Army doc. Hey, if you guys are
all so great,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.870
why does the military keep
getting rid of ya?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.705
Trust me, the last place I want
to be tonight is a hospital.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.173
Okay, then, what do we got?

11:48.175 --> 11:50.108
41-year-old female,
tachy in the 130s.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.309
Second and third degree burns

11:51.311 --> 11:53.178
to the right arm
and the upper back,

11:53.180 --> 11:55.847
estimating 14% body surface area
involvement.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.482
Teenage female.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.116
She has secondary blast injuries
to the face and neck.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.352
Sats are holding, but mildly
increased respiratory.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.487
The mother's burn on her forearm

12:02.489 --> 12:03.888
goes all the way down
to the tendon.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.674
I want to make sure she gets
in there asap.

12:05.675 --> 12:07.459
Okay, I'll call up the O.R.,
tell 'em you're coming right up.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.194
And I could use another scalpel.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.162
Debriding the whole upper back
is involved.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.964
Count me in. Drew?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.165
I'm gonna take the daughter.
I'm going to trauma.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.967
Okay.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.772
Sweetie, here's some money.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.408
I want you to...
Grab some food and sit tight.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.744
I'm sorry. I just...

12:25.746 --> 12:27.345
It's fine, mom.
It's your job.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.380
I promise I will make...
You'll make it up to me.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.851
I've heard it a million times.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.320
It's fine.
Now go save people.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.460
Don't leave the building.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.229
Got it.

12:44.231 --> 12:47.398
Darika.
Where's my daughter?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.367
She's in very good hands
with Dr. Alister.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.870
We're gonna update you
every 15 minutes, okay?

12:51.872 --> 12:54.439
But the best thing you can do
for her right now is recover.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.142
It really hurts.
Push more Dilaudid.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.810
I don't know what happened.

12:58.812 --> 12:59.978
I heard the explosion.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.780
I just knew
I had to find Darika,

13:01.782 --> 13:03.348
but I found her too late.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.415
No, you found her, Linda,

13:04.417 --> 13:06.184
and she's safe now
because of you.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.986
So the fire melted your shirt
into your back

13:07.988 --> 13:09.487
and into the soft tissue
of your forearms.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.439
So we need to remove that,

13:11.440 --> 13:13.390
along with any necrotic tissue
before infection sets in.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.960
No, no, I have to be able
to work. Am I gonna lose my arm?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.296
Not if I can help it.
Is there anyone we can call?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.131
No, my husband died
five years ago.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.268
It's been me and Darika against
the world ever since.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.870
I guess the world won today.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.138
Hey, this game's not over, okay?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.840
You and your girl are gonna
get through this.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.376
Not if I can't work. I'm
a seamstress. I need my hands.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.444
Hey, Linda, Linda, you know
the place you worked at?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.013
Was that ranger Ray's?
Yes.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.981
Yeah, I figured.
It's the best shop in town.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.117
I used to bring
my husband's uniforms there.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.269
Why'd you stop?

13:41.270 --> 13:43.420
Well, I'm a single mom, too.
Just divorce, not death.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.523
Doesn't matter
how you get there.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.492
Alone is a miserable place.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.327
You are not alone here, Linda.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.229
We're gonna do everything
we can for you.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.264
Please do whatever you have to.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.933
Okay, well,
let's get started then.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.305
This'll all be over soon,
Darika.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.375
How is it going?

14:04.377 --> 14:08.046
It sucks, it hurts,
and it's scary.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.081
Riles, we're not done
working here.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.349
We need a little more time.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.184
Your mom gave you some money,
right?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.486
Yeah.
Okay.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.856
Go spend it.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.630
Okay, honey, I'm gonna need you
to hold still the best you can.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.367
None of the shrapnel's too deep,
but it's in a lot of pieces,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.469
so it might just take a while
to get out.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.309
Hey, you were lucky
to have those on.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.477
Probably saved your vision.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.347
For the first and only time
in my life.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.482
Kids are always teasing me
about them,

14:44.484 --> 14:50.088
calling me CBG...
Coke bottle glasses.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.423
I'm sorry.
You know, kids can be cruel.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.125
But you're safe here, so again,

14:54.127 --> 14:56.928
just try and relax,
and we'll get you fixed up.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.481
Relax?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.033
My mom's in surgery, and you're
digging in my neck.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.268
How can I relax?

15:04.471 --> 15:05.970
Drew?
Riles, what are you...?

15:05.972 --> 15:07.739
I brought something for Darika.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.507
There's this show on YouTube
that's all about cereal.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.259
It's hilarious.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.010
I thought we could watch a few
episodes with my headphones

15:13.013 --> 15:14.579
while she's getting worked on.
Can I?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.351
I think it's an excellent idea.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.420
Come on.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.698
Pretty cool kid.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.367
Just came in here all on her own
to help our patient.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.003
The apple never falls far
from the tree.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.146
That don't look good
but it sure feel better.

15:48.148 --> 15:52.050
All right, well, we'll get this
to the lab and see what it says.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.351
It's amazing you can
paint like that

15:53.353 --> 15:55.086
while getting your knee drained.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.622
Well, if it's in your soul,
you can do anything.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.192
Painting used to be in my soul.
I wanted to be an artist.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.527
Dr. Rivera, how about
you pay more attention

16:02.529 --> 16:04.012
to what I'm doing?

16:04.013 --> 16:05.496
Or you might have to go back
to being an artist.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.966
Uh, no... no offense.
None taken.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.267
Needle inserted 1 centimeter

16:09.269 --> 16:11.336
medial to the superior third
of the patella.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.505
Relax, Paul. I was watching.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.674
You know,
you're a pretty good teacher.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.376
Thank you.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.411
When your mouth doesn't ruin it.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.014
She got you there.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.084
Okay.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.620
Let's go ahead and get these
to the lab then. Dr. Rivera?

16:29.622 --> 16:31.255
We'll be right back, sir.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.024
I'll try to survive.

16:36.763 --> 16:40.031
So... Were you really
an artist?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.366
Yeah.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.167
I gave painting a go once,

16:43.169 --> 16:46.137
but my community needed better
medical care than abstract art,

16:46.139 --> 16:48.439
so...
Here I am.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.558
Yeah, I didn't have a choice,
either.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.676
My entire family's in medicine.
Uh, surgery, actually.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.545
So anything else is
looked down upon.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.647
Sounds like a lot of pressure.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.417
Maybe that's why
you're such a dick sometimes.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.423
Oh, come on. I said sometimes,
not all the time.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.492
What did I tell you about
being so serious?

17:07.493 --> 17:09.527
Okay, I am not always
so serious.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.164
And I will have you know, I used
to be an artist as well.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.565
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.502
Fourth grade drawing contest.
I drew a sailboat.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.304
Won third place <i> and</i> a ride
on the fire truck.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.108
See? Look at that.
You made a joke.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.478
Do you still have the picture?

17:27.480 --> 17:30.148
No, I-i think it got lost
in a move or something.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.384
Kind of the only artistic thing
I've ever done.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.086
Wish I'd kept it.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.423
What happened?

17:38.425 --> 17:41.759
DOA. We tried.
Too much trauma.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.294
Hey, somebody contact
the morgue.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.412
I'm sure you guys did
all you could.

17:44.413 --> 17:45.529
Yeah, maybe more than
we <i> should have.</i>

17:45.532 --> 17:46.831
Maybe not enough.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.766
You know, you nearly died
trying to save him.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.501
Didn't do anything
you wouldn't...

17:50.503 --> 17:51.503
do him any good, did it?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.643
Topher?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.615
Hey. Toph?

18:04.617 --> 18:05.783
Give him some room.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.784
You okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.619
I'm fine. I'm fine.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.688
Let me check your eyes.
I'm okay. Hey, stop.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.756
Get... get that away from me! Just relax
a sec. Let me examine you, buddy.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.625
I'm... I'm fine.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.227
Toph, you may have a tear
in your eardrum.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.828
You just said I might have
a tear in my eardrum.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.864
See, I-i heard you, no problem.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.432
No...
I don't have an injury.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.103
I-I got knocked down.
Already tired.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.739
I pushed myself too hard this
morning with... with Kenny.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.676
It's hot out.
I'm... I'm dehydrated.

18:31.678 --> 18:35.313
I just need to drink water.
I'll be good as new.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.782
Okay, what is everyone
staring at?

18:37.784 --> 18:40.351
We're overrun with patients.
Everyone's just standing around.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.753
Get back to work!

18:42.755 --> 18:44.722
Okay, I'm not wrong here.
He needs to be examined, right?

18:44.724 --> 18:47.525
Yeah, he does, but just let him
calm down first, all right?

18:47.527 --> 18:48.693
We'll keep an eye on him.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.194
Yeah.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.831
Ha. I knew he wasn't faking.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.666
Fluid shows negatively
birefringent crystals.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.834
He's got gout.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.469
Not so fast.
Take a look at his chemistry.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.138
His kidneys are shutting down.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.806
Chloride, low potassium,
it's through the roof.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.474
Gout doesn't cause any of that.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.877
So what does?
Nothing good.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.786
Hey, Harold.

19:15.788 --> 19:16.854
You look a little flush.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.556
I told you,

19:18.558 --> 19:20.858
I just need some meds,
and I can be on my way.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.361
Okay, well, you feel like you're
running a fever, all right?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.431
Not, uh, not hungry, huh? When's
the last time you ate something?

19:27.433 --> 19:30.568
Everything tastes like
cardboard these days.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.836
Okay.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.206
Uh, can you...
Can you smell this, Harold?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.642
No. No.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.943
Okay.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.483
Uh, Harold, do you think
I could take a look

19:45.485 --> 19:47.285
at some of your paints?
You leave 'em be!

19:50.456 --> 19:52.256
The only thing I got left.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.725
Okay. Yeah, no... no problem.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.436
Scissors.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.448
All right. I think we're
looking pretty good.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.784
Mm, sats are up,
pressure's stable.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.889
<i>Hey. Any updates on
Linda, beyond "touch and go"?</i>

20:26.793 --> 20:28.726
<i>Yeah, we're closing now.</i>

20:31.998 --> 20:34.298
Any <i> other</i> details?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.872
<i>Scott, her daughter's asking.</i>

20:41.874 --> 20:44.308
Well, you can tell her daughter

20:44.310 --> 20:45.576
that things are looking
better now.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.813
<i>I'll be down as soon
as we're finished.</i>

20:48.815 --> 20:51.382
Thank you.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.587
All right, let's get
a sterile dressing on here.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.590
Linda's lucky. Could have gone
the other way.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.425
Nice work, Dr. Clemmens.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.327
You, too, doctor...

21:03.329 --> 21:05.730
Or it is major Jennings?

21:05.732 --> 21:09.500
Um, major for the next 34 days
and then doctor after that.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.335
I'm leaving the army.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.504
Really?
Yeah.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.807
Well, you planning on staying
in the San Antonio area?

21:16.809 --> 21:19.877
Because if you are,
you're hired.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.979
Wow. Really?

21:21.981 --> 21:24.849
Just like that?
Just like that.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.951
Nothing ever happens that fast
in the army.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.520
You've gotta wait three months
just to get permission to pee.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.722
Yeah, I've heard the stories.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.525
Seriously, your technique
is flawless.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.827
And your bedside manner is...

21:36.829 --> 21:38.863
Well, it's pretty damn good
for anyone,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.532
but for a surgeon, it's amazing.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.801
Well, it'd be hard not to feel
for Linda.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.687
Right? But I do.

21:46.688 --> 21:49.572
I try to connect to my patients
and not be a... Dick,

21:49.575 --> 21:51.309
like most surgeons.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.910
So what do you say then?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.812
Could really use another
orthopod around here.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.782
Uh, let me think on it.

21:57.784 --> 22:01.886
Look, I know there are
higher profile hospitals...

22:01.888 --> 22:04.772
No, it's not that.

22:04.773 --> 22:07.657
It's just, um, my life is
a little in flux right now.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.394
Yeah, of course.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.797
I would imagine coming home,

22:12.799 --> 22:14.665
there's lot to adjust to.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.467
Yeah.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.503
You find the world moves on like
you were never even in it.

22:21.974 --> 22:25.843
Anyway, thank you for
your very generous offer.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.880
I will seriously consider it.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.952
We are...

22:34.954 --> 22:36.354
All finished.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.055
Can I see it?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.024
Yeah.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.869
Will I have a big scar?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.004
Too early to tell right now.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.875
Which means yes. Right?

22:57.877 --> 23:00.811
So the kids at school won't
make fun at my glasses anymore.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.880
They'll be too busy making fun
of my face.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.649
Hey, hey, hey.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.417
If anybody says that in front
of me, I'll tap 'em out.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.854
Uh, hey? Slow down, okay?
And, Darika, if you don't like

23:09.856 --> 23:11.356
the way the scar ends up
looking,

23:11.357 --> 23:12.857
a plastic surgeon can usually
make it look better.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.392
Plastic surgery?
Yeah.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.527
We can't afford that.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.162
I'm gonna be ugly forever.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.966
No. Hey, you are not ugly.
Don't say that.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.968
Hey. You know what?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.437
My dad's a plastic surgeon.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.722
I can give him a new call

23:27.723 --> 23:29.006
and tell him he has to help out
my new friend.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.441
He'll totally do it.
Really?

23:30.443 --> 23:31.709
Riley.
What?

23:31.711 --> 23:32.843
He's my dad.
I know he will.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.512
Thank you.

23:36.149 --> 23:39.417
Hey.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.985
Do you not think you should
check with your dad

23:40.987 --> 23:42.186
before making promises?
No. Don't worry.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.155
I know how to make him do
what I want.

23:44.157 --> 23:45.573
All I have to tell him

23:45.574 --> 23:46.990
is that my mom doesn't think
he'll do it.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.559
Works every time.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.773
Whoa. You okay, Toph?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.975
I'd be better if this place
wasn't still packed.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.877
I need faster
patient turnaround, Kenny.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.813
Sorry, man. I'm doing the best
I can. It's been a crazy night.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.848
Don't... don't
tell me about the labor.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.982
Just show me the baby.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.117
You... you already got
three kids.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.886
Why... why you wanna see
another one?

24:18.991 --> 24:21.158
Hey, Toph? You need to stop.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.994
How many times I gotta tell you
I'm fine? Treat some patients.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.446
You're not fine, all right?

24:25.447 --> 24:26.897
You passed out in the middle
of the hallway.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.866
You look dizzy.
You had a bleeding eardrum.

24:28.868 --> 24:32.036
Which is fine now. I don't think it is.
You have to listen to me.

24:32.038 --> 24:35.039
Okay, I do not, Dr. Callahan,
need to listen to you.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.041
See this badge that says
"emergency room chief"?

24:37.043 --> 24:38.843
There seems to be
some confusion.

24:38.845 --> 24:42.813
<i>I</i> tell <i> you</i> what to do,
not the other way around.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.816
Sure, in normal circumstances.
This is not normal.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.919
Dr. Alexander?
What the hell are you doing?

24:48.921 --> 24:50.504
It is my professional opinion

24:50.505 --> 24:52.088
that Dr. Zia is currently unable
to perform his duties.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.924
Do you concur?

24:53.926 --> 24:55.960
I concur.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.863
Jordan. I'm sorry, Topher, but
this is for your own good.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.798
You're not well.
You need to be checked out.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.001
Dr. Alexander is now in charge
of the shift, everybody.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.070
I'm shutting you down.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.072
This is not happening.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.607
Well, it just happened.

25:20.119 --> 25:23.587
What's this? "Caine mutiny"?
You guys are embarrassing me.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.656
Well, you're doing a fine job
of that yourself.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.525
Toph, just check yourself in.
We'll run some tests.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.761
What's the harm?
The harm is we have a full ER

25:30.763 --> 25:32.863
and more patients than
we can treat,

25:32.865 --> 25:35.633
and my top two attendings
are treating me like

25:35.635 --> 25:37.201
I have a sucking chest wound.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.770
I'm fine!
You're not fine!

25:39.772 --> 25:41.672
You're exhibiting signs
of a traumatic brain injury.

25:41.674 --> 25:44.208
Irritability, moody, dizziness.
You could have a brain bleed.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.743
I'm moody and irritable

25:45.745 --> 25:47.912
because you're treating me
like I'm weak.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.747
Thank god
I didn't roll an ankle!

25:49.749 --> 25:51.215
You'd put me down like
old yeller!

25:51.217 --> 25:53.551
This isn't about weakness.
It's about physics, okay?

25:53.553 --> 25:54.785
You got blowed up.

25:54.787 --> 25:58.155
And I got back up
and did my job!

25:58.157 --> 25:59.890
There's a fine line between
crazy and stupid,

25:59.892 --> 26:01.325
and you've crossed it by a mile.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.860
And you cross it all the time!
You know what?

26:02.862 --> 26:03.928
I don't have all night
to listen to this.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.630
T.C., go treat your patients.

26:06.632 --> 26:07.798
<i>Go.</i>

26:11.737 --> 26:14.672
You... blood work,
brain scan now.

26:14.674 --> 26:15.906
I'm not taking those damn tests.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.525
I'm not asking.

26:17.526 --> 26:19.143
You don't want to take care
of yourself, then we will.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.611
You wanna get cleared?

26:20.613 --> 26:23.080
You take the scans
and you prove us wrong.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.917
Come on, I'll go with you.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.404
Great.

26:30.405 --> 26:32.205
I need someone to pull the knife
from my back.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.840
How you feeling, Linda?

26:49.842 --> 26:53.344
In pain.
Why is my chest so sore?

26:53.346 --> 26:55.613
The blast shot shrapnel
into your lungs.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.047
We had to get it out.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.850
Where's my daughter?
How is my daughter?

26:59.852 --> 27:03.187
Her injuries looked worse than
what they were. She'll be fine.

27:03.189 --> 27:06.223
I thought I'd lost her.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.858
Yeah, but you didn't.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.095
For now.

27:11.097 --> 27:15.866
They get older, they have their
own friends, their own ideas.

27:15.868 --> 27:19.169
They want to spend less time
with you.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.238
Yeah, but that's why
we have to make the time

27:21.240 --> 27:22.906
we do get to spend with them
count.

27:22.908 --> 27:26.777
Seems like our time together
is less and less.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.880
I'm working 6 days a week,
10 hours a day

27:29.882 --> 27:31.715
since my husband passed.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.418
I never thought I'd have
to give up so much

27:34.420 --> 27:36.420
just to keep my daughter close.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.724
You know, I don't always
like to think

27:40.726 --> 27:43.694
of my time apart from Riley
as "given up."

27:43.696 --> 27:46.997
I like to think of it
as an opportunity to inspire.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.266
You know, we're both
single working moms.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.068
When our daughters look at us,

27:51.070 --> 27:53.971
they should be able to see
strong, feminine role models

27:53.973 --> 27:55.305
that are capable of doing

27:55.307 --> 27:57.207
anything they set
their minds to.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.009
Never thought of it that way.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.378
Now I just have to convince
my ex.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.784
Your ex...
Was it a rough split?

28:06.786 --> 28:08.285
I'm... I'm sorry.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.920
No. Uh...

28:09.922 --> 28:13.824
No, it's fine.

28:13.826 --> 28:17.728
It wasn't any one thing,
you know, one incident really.

28:17.730 --> 28:20.197
It's just, uh...
You know, we both...

28:20.199 --> 28:23.367
We both joined the army
together as docs,

28:23.369 --> 28:26.036
but our careers
quickly diverged,

28:26.038 --> 28:27.471
and one of us was
deployed three times,

28:27.473 --> 28:28.972
was highly decorated,

28:28.974 --> 28:30.974
was promoted to major
below the zone.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.044
The other was my ex.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.817
So he resents you.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.321
Maybe. Maybe not.
It's nobody's fault.

28:44.323 --> 28:48.459
Just, uh, bad timing based on
the needs of the army.

28:48.461 --> 28:51.428
Unfortunately, our marriage
suffered because of it.

28:51.430 --> 28:55.399
But not your child,
and that's what's important.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.968
And you'd do anything for them.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.438
That's right.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.006
You do whatever it takes.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.835
Wanna tell me why

29:14.836 --> 29:16.252
we just perpetrated petty theft
on a patient?

29:16.255 --> 29:19.823
Yeah, I have a theory, but I'm
really hoping it's wrong.

29:19.825 --> 29:23.327
Paul Cummings hopes he's wrong.
Never thought I'd see the day.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.828
Yeah, I hate to disappoint you,

29:24.830 --> 29:26.296
but it's looking like
that's not the case.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.899
Cadmium poisoning. Look.
Is there a treatment?

29:28.901 --> 29:31.435
Maybe, if we caught it
early enough. Come on.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.071
I met this really nice girl
and she'd got a cut on her face.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.939
Yeah, I was hoping you could
really fix it.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.307
Come on.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.811
Yeah, mom's up in surgery.

29:40.812 --> 29:43.146
Yeah, I'm at the hospital, just
hanging in the ER with drew.

29:43.149 --> 29:46.316
He's this friend of mom's.
Uh, not <i> that</i> kind.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.785
He's gay
and teaches me jiujit...

29:47.787 --> 29:49.853
Let me talk to him for a second?

29:49.855 --> 29:52.055
Hello, sir.
This is Dr. drew Alister.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.158
I served with your ex-wife...

29:54.160 --> 29:56.960
Yeah. Just, yeah, no,
Riley's fine.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.529
We were just...

29:58.531 --> 30:00.931
Just hold on
and let me explain. I...

30:00.933 --> 30:04.334
Yes, I know her from the army,
but I'm a doctor...

30:04.336 --> 30:06.120
Hey.
Hey.

30:06.121 --> 30:07.905
Any luck filling that extra seat
to the spurs game?

30:07.907 --> 30:11.041
Naw. Drew has to work, too.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.976
I mean, it's a primo ticket,
and I can't even give it away.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.144
Can you believe that?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.979
Kenny, I want you to know

30:15.981 --> 30:18.048
that I would like to
go to the game with you.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.018
Oh. You... Ohh.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.587
I-I didn't know you liked
basketball.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.955
Well, you never asked.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.990
I'm telling you now.
I like basketball.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.792
Okay. Okay.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.593
I mean, you don't think
it'd be weird if we went?

30:30.596 --> 30:31.962
'Cause, you know...

30:31.964 --> 30:34.064
Well, we could stop
having sex...

30:34.065 --> 30:36.165
Mnh. Mnh... And go back to
being friends and coworkers.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.568
Would that make it easier
for you?

30:37.570 --> 30:40.571
Okay. I'll... I'll pick you up
at noon. It's a date.

30:40.573 --> 30:42.840
I mean, it's not a date.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.074
<i>Is</i> it a date?

30:44.076 --> 30:47.511
Oh, jeez.
I'll see you at noon, Kenny.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.885
Topher, this is just
due diligence.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.187
We have just as much of
a responsibility to our patients

30:57.189 --> 30:59.590
as we do to each other.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.992
You have a responsibility
to <i> me</i> as your boss.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.228
I make 100 tough calls
every shift

31:04.230 --> 31:06.363
and I have subordinates
questioning

31:06.365 --> 31:08.999
not only my judgment,
but questioning <i> me.</i>

31:09.001 --> 31:11.869
That... that makes a hard job
that much harder.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.605
I think you're confusing loyalty
with integrity.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.943
No, no. I'm... I'm telling you
they're one and the same.

31:19.945 --> 31:24.081
Who stood by your side when
you became ER chief? Me.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.983
Who helped implement

31:25.984 --> 31:27.884
your unpopular policies
from the day shift? I did.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.019
Not because I agreed
or disagreed

31:29.021 --> 31:30.254
with what you were trying to do,

31:30.256 --> 31:31.588
but because it was
the right thing.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.658
If you want to be a good leader,
you learn to follow.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.327
<i>You</i> seem to have skipped
that step.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.963
It is not my job
to blindly follow.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.566
If I let you make one bad call,

31:42.568 --> 31:44.368
I'm just as much to blame
as you are.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.719
Now get on this table.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.069
I'm gonna remember that
next time you're in charge.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.272
You do that.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.640
Start the scan.

31:59.385 --> 32:03.587
You called my ex-husband?
He just blindsided me.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.522
No, I'm not the one
who called him.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.524
He had no idea
that you even existed.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.360
Well, yeah, I get that now.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.195
Didn't know that when I was
talking to him.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.030
You could've told me. You know, I didn't
think you would ever have to talk to him.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.464
You picked up Riley
at my mom's house

32:14.466 --> 32:16.366
because he hates
Riley being a jock.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.036
He hates anything
that reminds him of me.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.537
So Riley and I never
told him about you

32:20.539 --> 32:22.639
because we knew he would
put a stop to the jiujitsu.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.107
Okay, well,
you should've told me.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.642
Well, you know,
I was a little busy.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.978
I can't control everything
from 10,000 miles away.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.013
And I was still there,
I might add, because of you.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.983
I would've stayed a year longer
in your place and you know that.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.518
That was the general's call...
You know what?

32:34.519 --> 32:36.052
And if you had never gotten
involved in that Sharbat's case

32:36.055 --> 32:37.688
then I would never... she was
a 15-year-old girl, Syd.

32:37.690 --> 32:41.191
And I might lose my girl
because of it.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.394
Wait, what are you...
What are you talking about?

32:46.332 --> 32:48.966
My ex is suing
for full custody of Riley.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.701
He... he can't do that.
He can, drew.

32:50.703 --> 32:53.003
He's got more money,
he's got a second marriage

32:53.005 --> 32:55.105
that the courts view
as a more secure home life

32:55.107 --> 32:58.275
than with some mom who's off in
Afghanistan for half the year.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.344
So what are you gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

33:00.346 --> 33:01.678
I'm gonna grab my ankles
and take it.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.114
I'm gonna head to D.C.
D.C.?

33:04.116 --> 33:05.315
That's where he's moving.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.217
That's why he's suing
for full custody,

33:07.219 --> 33:09.086
so he can leave
without my permission.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.555
So we fight it. We can fight it.
Drew...

33:11.557 --> 33:13.557
Syd, you can... you can get
a job here.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.492
I'll vouch for you.
I'll help take care of Riley.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.995
I can't, drew.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.497
I am heading to D.C. until I can
come up with a better plan.

33:22.001 --> 33:25.502
I have been away from Riley
way too long

33:25.504 --> 33:27.471
and I am not letting her leave
without me.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.072
I still think that we need
to go do...

33:29.074 --> 33:31.641
There is no "we"!
Drew, it is Riley and me.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.276
You are not part of this family,

33:33.278 --> 33:35.212
so stop acting like you have
some kind of say,

33:35.214 --> 33:37.781
'cause you don't.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.126
You're right.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.395
Sorry. Just trying to help.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.230
Well, you can't.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.483
Hey.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.118
You know I was only being
a hard-ass on you

34:15.120 --> 34:17.154
the way you are to me when
I do something stupid, right?

34:17.156 --> 34:19.755
Which is almost all the time.

34:19.757 --> 34:23.260
Maybe I-i could've handled it
a bit better.

34:24.630 --> 34:28.098
Well, you definitely could've
handled it better.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.268
But you were right.

34:32.271 --> 34:35.304
No bleeding, but I have
a bad concussion.

34:35.306 --> 34:38.375
Thank you. I'll be
riding the pine for a week.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.677
So you promise next time, uh,

34:40.679 --> 34:43.480
you won't step into the breach
so soon without me?

34:45.250 --> 34:48.217
Yeah. I learned my lesson.

34:48.219 --> 34:51.688
I'm not the man I used to be.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.591
Turned the corner
from being in good shape

34:54.592 --> 34:57.227
to being in good shape
for my age.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.162
Right.

34:59.164 --> 35:00.597
So what's wrong with that?

35:02.601 --> 35:06.803
I-I wanna be like I was
when I was 25.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.872
That's why I was so pissed.

35:08.874 --> 35:14.244
It... it really hit home
that I never will be.

35:14.246 --> 35:17.681
Toph, you can't compare yourself
to who you were back then.

35:17.683 --> 35:20.484
All right? Compare yourself to
who you were a few months ago.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.752
You changed your diet,
upped your regimen.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.589
Few months ago, you got knocked
out by a bum shoulder.

35:25.591 --> 35:29.159
Now it took a bomb blast.
That makes you a stud.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.627
I'm...
I'm like a total stud.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.230
Total stud.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.298
Hey, you did say it changed
your sex life with Janet.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.134
It did.
Huh?

35:37.136 --> 35:39.169
She says she likes to rub
my burgeoning abs.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.638
Oh, yeah, I-i don't need that
kind of image in my head. TMI.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.907
But it proves my point, right?

35:43.909 --> 35:46.543
You're not gonna be the man you
were as a 25-year-old ranger,

35:46.545 --> 35:49.713
but you're still
a badass 40-something.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.716
I got <i> blowed up.</i>
Mm-hmm.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.184
I'm still ticking.
Yeah.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.752
How many doctors can say that?
Not many.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.587
Not even 20-something-year-olds,
huh?

35:57.589 --> 36:01.324
Look, get an uber home,
have Janet do your... Whatever.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.759
I'll see you in a week. Adios.
Adios.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.294
All right.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.198
You're both expected to make
a full recovery

36:08.200 --> 36:10.600
thanks to the quick thinking
and actions

36:10.602 --> 36:13.303
of doctors Alister and Jennings.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.572
Thank you so much
for everything.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.375
I don't know how I can
ever repay you.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.277
Or the hospital bill.

36:22.058 --> 36:23.836
Well, the first one,
you don't have to.

36:23.837 --> 36:25.615
And the second one, we've
contacted some vet charities

36:25.617 --> 36:27.284
that are gonna step in
and help out.

36:27.286 --> 36:31.855
Yeah, and, Riley, I believe you
have some good news for Darika.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.723
Excuse me.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.759
My dad's going to do
Darika's repair for free

36:35.761 --> 36:37.327
at his surgery center.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.597
Oh, my god. You must have
the greatest dad ever.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.699
I do.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.269
And the greatest mom, too.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.240
I'm so glad you're
moving, too, mom.

36:50.242 --> 36:52.242
I can't be without you anymore.

36:52.244 --> 36:57.347
And you'll never have to be
again, I swear.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.786
Wow.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.955
I didn't think anyone could
do you justice.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.790
The man is a magician
with the brush.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.325
Yeah.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.795
Will the chelation therapy
help him?

37:11.797 --> 37:13.730
Uh, I think it will, yeah.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.565
We got it early.
Nice catch.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.400
Thank you, Paul.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.304
I live to serve.

37:21.306 --> 37:24.507
I mean it.
No BS, no ball-busting.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.476
You really came through.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.679
Anytime.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.517
Oh, Paul?

37:34.519 --> 37:35.952
I almost forgot.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.023
That's, uh...

37:40.025 --> 37:41.958
That's incredible.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.327
Wow, Harold is really
an amazing artist.

37:46.265 --> 37:49.366
Moron.<i> I</i> drew it.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.268
I'm the amazing artist.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.402
Oh.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.506
I did it as a thank you.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.974
Uh... Wow.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.578
That's... that's... you know,
that's so... you did that...

38:01.580 --> 38:02.979
Um, thank you.

38:02.981 --> 38:06.049
Oh. Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't know.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.021
I'm full of poison
and half-asleep

38:11.023 --> 38:13.423
and even I could tell
she likes you.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.725
No.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.362
You think?

38:19.364 --> 38:21.331
Boy...

38:22.567 --> 38:23.867
Good night.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.088
All I wanted to do is apologize.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.456
And you did.
And I'm...

38:46.458 --> 38:49.426
Scott, I'm just...
I'm concerned for you.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.094
You don't need to be.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.797
I just... I don't... I don't
understand what you're doing.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.732
You know, I don't...
I don't get it.

38:55.734 --> 39:00.904
Look...

39:00.906 --> 39:04.107
I just had a really crappy year.
You know that much.

39:04.109 --> 39:08.011
And after the accident,
I lost everything.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.346
And I...
And I don't mean money.

39:09.348 --> 39:12.082
I mean, any sense of
a normal life,

39:12.084 --> 39:13.950
because all I could do
was think about

39:13.952 --> 39:16.519
was how Malik was never gonna
have a normal life again.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.889
And I was at rock-bottom.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.591
And alone.

39:23.762 --> 39:27.130
Annie understands

39:27.132 --> 39:29.833
what it's like to be
in that place.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.835
And...

39:31.837 --> 39:36.072
She's really there for me now,

39:36.074 --> 39:38.258
in a way that no one else
ever has been.

39:44.783 --> 39:48.418
So that's all anybody really
needs to understand about it.

39:55.394 --> 40:00.096
So you knew you were moving
and you didn't tell me?

40:00.098 --> 40:02.399
That's why you were being weird
about the tournament?

40:02.401 --> 40:04.834
I just didn't know.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.103
I was hoping I could make my dad
do what I wanted,

40:07.105 --> 40:08.705
but it didn't work this time.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.474
Don't worry about it.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.643
Hey, look at me.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.146
D.C.'s a cool place.
You got all that history there.

40:16.148 --> 40:17.147
You're gonna love it.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.516
But you're not gonna be there.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.656
I'm really gonna miss you.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.425
Okay. Okay.

40:31.463 --> 40:34.798
I'm gonna miss you, too.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.166
Know that, okay?

40:47.012 --> 40:49.179
I'm sorry.

40:49.181 --> 40:52.582
For what?
For what I said.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.150
I was so upset about what
it meant to me

40:54.152 --> 40:56.085
that I forgot about what
it would mean to you.

40:59.191 --> 41:00.190
It's okay.

41:00.192 --> 41:01.724
No, it's not.

41:01.726 --> 41:04.961
You were there for her
when I couldn't be.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.499
You are part of our family,
you know?

41:24.049 --> 41:25.982
I'm going to miss you, drew.
