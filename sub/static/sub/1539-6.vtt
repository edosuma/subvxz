<i>There's a war coming, a terrible war.</i>

00:03.881 --> 00:05.482
<i>There will be chaos.</i>

00:05.516 --> 00:06.516
Rivers of blood in the streets!

00:06.551 --> 00:07.517
I know it!

00:07.552 --> 00:08.952
I-I-I can see it coming!

00:08.986 --> 00:10.520
<i>MOONEY: It's time.</i>

00:10.555 --> 00:12.756
Somebody has to take over;
it might as well be me.

00:13.725 --> 00:15.592
(screams)

00:15.626 --> 00:17.127
OSWALD: Hello, James.

00:17.161 --> 00:18.161
Old friend.

00:18.196 --> 00:19.963
Mooney, the MCU cops...

00:19.997 --> 00:21.498
none of them know Penguin's alive?

00:21.532 --> 00:23.173
If they did, I'd be dead already.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.890
James Gordon is not a good guy.

00:24.924 --> 00:27.259
He framed Mario Pepper for
the murder of the Waynes.

00:27.293 --> 00:30.262
<i>James Gordon is the most
honest man I've ever met.</i>

00:30.296 --> 00:31.797
This is not a city or a job

00:31.831 --> 00:33.632
- for nice guys.
- You're a cynic.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.801
A slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.

00:35.835 --> 00:36.835
You're probably right.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.205
(water dripping slowly)

00:46.780 --> 00:48.781
I am the Spirit of the Goat.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.351
(breathing unsteadily)

00:52.385 --> 00:54.787
I am the Spirit

00:54.821 --> 00:56.021
of the Goat.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.626
I am the Spirit...

01:00.660 --> 01:02.728

01:48.074 --> 01:51.143
That's the van registered
to Randall Milkie.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.845
We were right, Dix.

01:52.879 --> 01:53.879
Of course we're right.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.352
(grunts) Dispatch,

<i>Detective Dix</i>

02:08.995 --> 02:11.263
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:11.298 --> 02:12.998
Come on, man, we gotta get in there.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.533
Wait a second, listen to me.

02:14.567 --> 02:15.534
Wait a minute!

02:15.568 --> 02:17.870
Listen to me.

02:17.904 --> 02:21.073
Randall thinks he's the
reincarnation of some

02:21.107 --> 02:24.143
ancient, murdering goat spirit.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.078
We are waiting for backup.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.280
He's got Shelly Lawson
in there. If he kills her,

02:28.315 --> 02:29.715
that's three people we lost to this maniac.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.850
Gotham's Golden Rule, Harvey.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.386
No heroes.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.394
That son of a bitch.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.300
Idiot! She's already dead.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.468
BULLOCK: You don't know that.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.670
Yeah, I know it.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.387
I told you.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.842
BULLOCK: Shelly.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.343
I told you she'd be cold.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.343
She's been here half of the night.

03:34.814 --> 03:35.915
BULLOCK: Wait a minute.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.416
New candles, barely melted.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.985
Just lit.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.721
Ah, that's great. That's great news.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.356
(creaking sound)

03:57.671 --> 03:58.938
Randall Milkie?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.273
You're under arrest

04:01.308 --> 04:02.708
for the murders of Shelly Lawson,

04:02.742 --> 04:05.444
Daniel Tremont and Edward Talbot.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.746
Randall! Be smart, come out of there

04:07.781 --> 04:09.577
or we're gonna have to blow you away!

04:09.615 --> 04:11.383
Randall Milkie is undone.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.019
Gone.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.654
This body is moved by
the Spirit of the Goat.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.690
Uh, we're gonna go with Milkie.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.125
I already did the paperwork.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.201
(Dix screams)

04:29.236 --> 04:30.402
Dix!

04:30.437 --> 04:32.204
(grunting)

04:32.239 --> 04:34.139
(groans)

04:34.174 --> 04:36.509
You can never stop the Goat!

04:36.543 --> 04:39.678
This body may fail, but I will not!

04:39.713 --> 04:43.048
I will always come back.
I will always come back!

04:43.083 --> 04:44.416
Come back from this!

04:57.831 --> 04:58.797
Milkie.

04:58.832 --> 04:59.999
(sirens approaching)

05:00.033 --> 05:01.333
Dix!

05:02.369 --> 05:03.569
Dix!

05:03.603 --> 05:05.671
Talk to me. Talk to me.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.039
Dix, come on, man.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.240
Come on. Dix.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.075
- Help!
- He's through there!

05:10.110 --> 05:11.243
BULLOCK: We got an officer down!

05:11.278 --> 05:13.279
We need help now!

05:27.661 --> 05:29.662
(breathing heavily)

05:34.935 --> 05:37.269
NYGMA: Detective Bullock.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.737
Detective Bullock, do you give up?

05:38.772 --> 05:40.739
- What?
- My riddle.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.208
A man has to cross a river

05:42.242 --> 05:44.009
with a wolf, a cabbage and a goat...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.477
Ed, please.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.546
What's the time of death?

05:47.581 --> 05:48.884
Examiner pegs it

05:48.909 --> 05:50.576
at just before 3:00 a.m. this morning.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.378
He's a bit eager with
his coagulation markers,

05:52.413 --> 05:54.380
so I'd put it at closer to 1:00.

05:56.016 --> 05:57.850
Killer left her identification for us.

05:57.885 --> 06:00.853
Amanda Hastings, 21 years old.

06:00.888 --> 06:02.055
She comes from money.

06:02.089 --> 06:03.322
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm guessing

06:03.357 --> 06:05.058
she was the oldest in her family.

06:05.092 --> 06:06.325
Why is that?

06:06.360 --> 06:08.961
The Goat always kills the firstborn.

06:08.996 --> 06:11.331
It's all the same. The same M.O.,

06:11.365 --> 06:13.232
the same victim choice, presentation...

06:13.267 --> 06:14.500
it's all the same.

06:14.535 --> 06:16.502
We got a copycat.

06:16.537 --> 06:19.839
- You all right, Detective?
- No, I'm not all right!

06:19.873 --> 06:22.175
I already solved this case.

06:22.209 --> 06:23.776
Where's Gordon?

06:23.811 --> 06:25.511
Apparently, he's not answering his phone.

06:25.546 --> 06:26.512
(giggles)

06:26.547 --> 06:28.014
He's not answering his...

06:28.048 --> 06:30.516
You mean I'm on the clock
before the Boy Scout?

06:30.551 --> 06:31.517
Mm-hmm.

06:31.552 --> 06:33.152
This is freaking ridiculous.

06:33.187 --> 06:34.687
Fine, I'll tell you the answer.

06:34.722 --> 06:37.323
So the man crosses the river
with the wolf and the cabbage.

06:37.358 --> 06:40.059
- He leaves the wolf, he goes back with...
- Ed.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.966
(phone buzzing)

06:47.000 --> 06:48.701
I'm not apologizing for my past.

06:48.736 --> 06:50.370
I'm not asking you to.
You're not listening.

06:50.404 --> 06:51.738
No, you're not listening.

06:51.772 --> 06:53.639
I'm not asking you to walk away from this.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.375
Really? Because it sounds like you are.

06:55.409 --> 06:57.210
And we keep going around and around

06:57.244 --> 06:59.645
and I keep telling you
that I don't have a choice.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.681
Barbara...

07:04.284 --> 07:06.419
This city...

07:06.453 --> 07:08.021
the law, the crime here, they're all...

07:08.055 --> 07:10.723
twisted up at each other like a maze.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.759
I came here to be a cop.

07:14.261 --> 07:16.729
This city needs something else.

07:16.764 --> 07:18.297
So, okay...

07:18.332 --> 07:20.333
I understand.

07:21.735 --> 07:25.304
I'm just asking for one thing:

07:25.339 --> 07:27.473
half of what you have to carry.

07:27.508 --> 07:29.575
God knows I've...

07:29.610 --> 07:32.111
I've dumped my half on
you and you carry it.

07:32.146 --> 07:34.054
Barbara, what I'm dealing
with, it's so dangerous...

07:34.079 --> 07:38.518
Half... of what you carry.

07:38.552 --> 07:41.087
If you think I care about the risk,

07:41.121 --> 07:42.955
then you're forgetting who I am.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.692
I swear I'm not.

07:48.195 --> 07:50.229
Are we okay?

07:50.264 --> 07:52.031
Are we still fighting?

07:55.169 --> 07:56.602
We're negotiating terms.

07:56.637 --> 07:59.672
Oh.

07:59.707 --> 08:00.907
That's not good for me.

08:00.941 --> 08:03.710
You tell me what you're up against.

08:04.745 --> 08:05.878
Okay?

08:05.913 --> 08:07.914
You let me in.

08:08.949 --> 08:10.316
Then we're okay.

08:12.086 --> 08:14.921
(phone buzzing)

08:14.955 --> 08:17.156
(sighs) That's work again.

08:17.191 --> 08:18.791
Yep.

08:19.827 --> 08:21.361
I'll tell you everything.

08:21.395 --> 08:23.997
Everything I can.

08:24.031 --> 08:25.098
Okay?

08:25.132 --> 08:26.432
I'll make it right.

08:26.467 --> 08:28.568
Okay.

08:32.606 --> 08:34.273
(door opens)

08:35.576 --> 08:36.909
(door closes)

08:38.645 --> 08:40.645
MONTOYA: There's the one, right there.

08:45.052 --> 08:48.688
We've been canvassing this
waterfront for days, Monty.

08:48.722 --> 08:51.190
None of these river rats are gonna help us.

08:51.225 --> 08:53.259
We don't get a lead in the next 24 hours,

08:53.293 --> 08:55.294
MCU is dropping this.

08:55.329 --> 08:57.964
Hey.

08:57.998 --> 08:59.766
I'm on the disability six months.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.300
Where do you expect me to go?

09:01.335 --> 09:03.302
We're not flushing you, old-timer. Okay?

09:03.337 --> 09:04.704
Just want to ask you some questions.

09:04.738 --> 09:05.838
Yeah, about a shooting

09:05.873 --> 09:07.840
that took place recently
on that pier back there.

09:07.875 --> 09:08.908
A shooting?

09:08.942 --> 09:09.942
Yah.

09:11.011 --> 09:13.146
I saw it good.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.615
Okay... uh, great. You-you ever this man?

09:15.649 --> 09:17.683
That was the man did the shooting.

09:19.353 --> 09:21.320
A cold customer, that man.

09:21.355 --> 09:22.522
Ice floating in the veins.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.592
We got the son of a bitch.

09:26.627 --> 09:28.628
We got Gordon.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.961
(seagulls squawking)

09:35.995 --> 09:38.063
(indistinct conversations)

09:39.332 --> 09:42.300
- "Gotham Goat"?
- A wannabe.

09:42.335 --> 09:45.136
For a copycat, the copy is... ugh.

09:45.171 --> 09:46.805
Downright creepy, is what it is.

09:46.839 --> 09:49.641
- You moonlighting or something?
- Huh? Me?

09:49.675 --> 09:51.076
Yeah. 'Cause you're late

09:51.110 --> 09:53.144
and you look like crap warmed over.

09:53.179 --> 09:54.579
Write me up if you want.

09:54.614 --> 09:57.182
- Screw you, Boy Scout.
- You're in a good mood.

09:57.216 --> 09:59.818
I'm in a déjà vu acid flashback.

09:59.852 --> 10:00.952
Someone's hunting the kids

10:00.987 --> 10:02.087
of Gotham's top one percent,

10:02.121 --> 10:03.521
the press will have a field day,

10:03.556 --> 10:04.990
city turns upside down,

10:05.024 --> 10:06.591
the whole thing's gonna
come down on the GCPD

10:06.626 --> 10:07.626
like a ton of bricks.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.194
Well, then, let's catch him quick.

10:09.228 --> 10:11.229
(sighs)

10:13.699 --> 10:15.667
I'm guessing the killer knew the victim,

10:15.701 --> 10:16.935
Amanda Hastings, somehow.

10:16.969 --> 10:18.169
We'll go see the family,

10:18.204 --> 10:21.239
see if we can try to get
something we can work with.

10:21.274 --> 10:22.774
And, Nygma...

10:22.808 --> 10:25.410
let me know when they're set
up for the autopsy, all right?

10:25.444 --> 10:27.545
Anything in particular you
want me to look out for?

10:27.580 --> 10:29.581
Just call me.

10:39.058 --> 10:40.825
<i>MAN: You see, the strange thing,</i>

10:40.860 --> 10:42.560
the horrible thing,

10:42.595 --> 10:45.730
is that I've been having
the same dream for weeks.

10:45.765 --> 10:47.499
Of a dark,

10:47.533 --> 10:49.134
overbearing presence.

10:49.168 --> 10:51.002
Mr. Hastings, about your daughter...

10:51.037 --> 10:53.772
and we know that this
is difficult... but...

10:53.806 --> 10:56.474
did she have anyone in
her life that worried you?

10:56.509 --> 10:58.009
Anyone who might have wished her harm?

10:58.044 --> 11:01.046
Everybody loved my Amanda.

11:04.784 --> 11:07.886
Uh, Mr. Hastings, are... are you all right?

11:09.088 --> 11:10.789
Robert, if you need to take a moment,

11:10.823 --> 11:12.457
I'm sure it'll be all right.

11:12.491 --> 11:13.491
Absolutely.

11:15.995 --> 11:17.996
Come on.

11:22.535 --> 11:25.537
I know you gentlemen are
working against the clock,

11:25.571 --> 11:27.405
but I'm afraid Mr. and Mrs. Hastings

11:27.440 --> 11:29.607
might not be ready for this.

11:29.642 --> 11:31.042
I can see that.

11:31.077 --> 11:32.877
And you are the Hastings'
family therapist, Dr. Marks?

11:32.912 --> 11:35.180
Yes, I treat mostly Mr. Hastings,

11:35.214 --> 11:37.315
but we've had many family sessions.

11:37.350 --> 11:40.151
Mr. Hastings has a very...

11:40.186 --> 11:42.120
delicate nature.

11:42.154 --> 11:44.055
I'm afraid he's not at all capable

11:44.090 --> 11:45.657
of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

11:45.691 --> 11:48.093
No one's capable of dealing
with this kind of tragedy.

11:48.127 --> 11:49.694
It's a freight train.

11:49.729 --> 11:51.563
It runs you over.

11:51.597 --> 11:53.698
And you try to pick up what's left.

11:53.733 --> 11:55.567
You don't believe in treatment.

11:55.601 --> 11:57.335
I believe in the tranquilizers

11:57.370 --> 11:58.803
you clobbered Mrs. Hastings with.

11:58.838 --> 12:00.038
And if you're giving out samples...

12:00.072 --> 12:01.139
Okay, uh...

12:01.173 --> 12:02.273
Detective, maybe we should, uh...

12:02.308 --> 12:04.576
BULLOCK: Yeah, you're right, we should.

12:04.610 --> 12:06.177
Excuse me.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.545
Thank you, Doctor.

12:07.580 --> 12:10.015
Mm-hmm.

12:10.049 --> 12:11.149
WOMAN: Uh-huh.

12:11.183 --> 12:13.685
All right, got it... and got it.

12:13.719 --> 12:15.720
Yes, sir, I'll bring
those files right away.

12:19.859 --> 12:21.826
Mr. Nygma.

12:21.861 --> 12:24.562
Hello, Miss Kringle.

12:31.003 --> 12:32.771
So, I'm just looking for
all the information you have

12:32.805 --> 12:35.306
on the Goat murders from ten years ago.

12:35.341 --> 12:37.475
Don't you find it curious?

12:37.510 --> 12:39.411
Why someone would resurrect the myth

12:39.445 --> 12:41.112
of a centuries-old bogeyman.

12:41.147 --> 12:42.447
And what is it about the Goat

12:42.481 --> 12:43.782
that has made two separate people decide

12:43.816 --> 12:44.883
to kill in his name?

12:44.917 --> 12:47.952
No, I-I don't find it curious.

12:47.987 --> 12:49.321
I think I would like your parents.

12:49.355 --> 12:51.122
Excuse me?

12:51.157 --> 12:54.326
Kringle, such a rare surname.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.227
Most people changed it generations ago,

12:56.262 --> 12:57.629
out of embarrassment.

12:57.663 --> 12:59.764
Not only did your parents keep it;

12:59.799 --> 13:02.000
they called you "Kristin."

13:02.034 --> 13:04.736
"Kristin Kringle." (laughs)

13:04.770 --> 13:06.771
They must be very humorous people.

13:06.806 --> 13:08.340
Humor is so important, don't you think?

13:08.374 --> 13:11.142
Remember you have to sign
out any evidence you pull.

13:11.177 --> 13:14.145
How do you find anything at all in here?

13:14.180 --> 13:15.980
I mean, organizationally speaking,

13:16.015 --> 13:17.082
this place is a shambles.

13:17.116 --> 13:19.267
I am warning you, Nygma.

13:19.669 --> 13:21.720
I have this exactly as I want it.

13:21.754 --> 13:23.388
I know where everything is.

13:23.422 --> 13:26.524
- Understand?
- Preternaturally.

13:26.559 --> 13:28.460
But...

13:28.494 --> 13:31.763
I can help you, Kristin Kringle.

13:33.799 --> 13:36.167
I doubt that very much.

13:44.176 --> 13:47.679
There's a much better way to do this.

13:47.713 --> 13:50.281
Amanda Hastings was last
seen entering this building...

13:50.316 --> 13:51.983
Tuesday, midnight.

13:52.018 --> 13:53.685
That's about 36 hours ago.

13:53.719 --> 13:55.553
You think she was abducted from here?

13:55.588 --> 13:58.657
I don't know. That was
Milkie's M.O. ten years ago.

13:58.691 --> 14:00.959
He took each one of the
victims from their homes.

14:00.993 --> 14:04.229
But CSI found no signs of a break-in.

14:04.263 --> 14:05.764
They didn't with Randall, either.

14:05.798 --> 14:07.232
He worked for an air-conditioning

14:07.266 --> 14:09.300
maintenance crew that
covered all three buildings.

14:09.335 --> 14:11.403
He had keys?

14:11.437 --> 14:13.338
He had keys.

14:15.474 --> 14:16.875
This is Detective Gordon.

14:16.909 --> 14:18.243
I need the employee list

14:18.277 --> 14:20.145
of every maintenance and janitorial company

14:20.179 --> 14:21.813
with access to the Hastings' building.

14:22.882 --> 14:25.216
Yeah, I'll tell him.

14:25.251 --> 14:27.085
They're ready for the autopsy.

14:37.997 --> 14:39.964
Mother!

14:39.999 --> 14:41.633
GERTRUD: I wait for so long,

14:41.667 --> 14:44.336
and now he scratches at the door,

14:44.370 --> 14:45.737
the filthy tomcat.

14:45.771 --> 14:47.439
Hi, Mom.

14:47.473 --> 14:48.974
I'm alive.

14:52.078 --> 14:53.545
I don't know why you always think

14:53.579 --> 14:55.146
I'm running off with some painted lady.

14:55.181 --> 14:57.749
- I don't even date.
- Ha!

14:57.783 --> 15:00.685
Why you don't call your
mother in all this time?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.921
I tell you why.

15:02.955 --> 15:06.524
You got tangled in some
hussy's demon-purse!

15:06.559 --> 15:08.827
Mother, there was no hussy.

15:08.861 --> 15:12.063
Only betrayal and savagery and...

15:13.833 --> 15:16.868
All I wanted was a little respect.

15:16.902 --> 15:19.270
And they hurt me.

15:19.305 --> 15:20.438
So cruelly.

15:20.473 --> 15:23.908
Oh, there was no other woman.

15:23.943 --> 15:25.276
(laughs)

15:25.311 --> 15:28.113
I have been to hell and
back. They tried to kill me.

15:28.147 --> 15:30.415
The bullies again?

15:30.449 --> 15:33.118
My poor, poor darling.

15:33.152 --> 15:38.757
They only do these things
because they resent you.

15:38.791 --> 15:41.426
Envy and spite.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.863
That's all it is.

15:48.668 --> 15:51.536
You watch, Mom.

15:51.570 --> 15:53.405
I'm gonna be somebody in this town.

15:53.439 --> 15:56.908
I always knew this.

15:59.037 --> 16:02.747
Victim was asphyxiated, likely
with ether or chloroform.

16:02.782 --> 16:04.649
Look under the scalp.

16:05.851 --> 16:07.085
Humor me.

16:08.587 --> 16:10.188
At the base of the skull

16:10.222 --> 16:12.957
will be an incision, about an inch long.

16:12.992 --> 16:15.460
Sewn closed.

16:15.494 --> 16:19.597
Wait a minute. Yes. How did I miss that?

16:19.632 --> 16:22.467
An incision stitched closed,

16:22.501 --> 16:24.035
near the occipital.

16:26.138 --> 16:28.340
Over a foreign object.

16:28.374 --> 16:31.209
- What is it?
- It's a penny.

16:32.311 --> 16:33.979
He's right.

16:35.881 --> 16:37.515
A penny?

16:37.550 --> 16:39.351
Randall Milkie's M.O.

16:39.385 --> 16:42.220
No one could know that detail.

16:43.389 --> 16:45.390
It isn't a copycat.

16:47.767 --> 16:48.927
It can't be.

16:54.009 --> 16:56.196
BULLOCK: Ten years ago, Randall Milkie took

16:56.230 --> 16:58.131
an 1813 Liberty penny just like this one

16:58.166 --> 17:00.333
and sewed it into the heads
of each one of his victims.

17:00.368 --> 17:01.935
Why?

17:01.969 --> 17:03.537
How the hell do I know?

17:03.571 --> 17:05.972
He bum-rushed me wearing animal horns.

17:06.007 --> 17:07.808
I shot him. We didn't talk coin collecting.

17:07.842 --> 17:09.843
And you're sure no one else
could have found this out?

17:09.877 --> 17:11.912
Milkie was the definition of a loner.

17:11.945 --> 17:13.146
He didn't tell anybody.

17:13.181 --> 17:15.281
We left it out of the file intentionally.

17:15.316 --> 17:17.147
- You suppressed evidence.
- We "Easter-egged" it.

17:17.185 --> 17:19.433
We figured a killer like the
Goat would have a good chance

17:19.458 --> 17:22.856
- of drawing admirers.
- Yeah, it's copycat porn.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.769
We left out this one detail.

17:24.819 --> 17:26.386
The coins, it never hit the papers.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.789
How the hell did this
copy-Goat know about this?

17:28.823 --> 17:30.724
Okay, so you hid it.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.726
But the medical examiner, he had to know.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.294
Ed Hayes. Yeah, sure.

17:34.328 --> 17:35.896
But he died of cirrhosis.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.598
That just leaves me. And Dix.

17:38.633 --> 17:39.966
Captain, please, there's no reason...

17:40.001 --> 17:41.134
Go talk to him.

17:41.169 --> 17:42.302
Make sure he didn't

17:42.336 --> 17:43.837
tell anyone about the coins.

17:43.871 --> 17:45.772
Hell, see if he's got any ideas.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.544
<i>I'm Lacey White,</i>

17:50.578 --> 17:54.915
<i>and this is the Gotham 7 Goat Watch.</i>

17:54.949 --> 17:59.286
<i>Tonight, Gotham's wealthiest
one percent rests fitfully</i>

17:59.320 --> 18:02.356
<i>under a copycat killer's deadly shadow.</i>

18:02.390 --> 18:04.458
<i>And if you happen to be one</i>

18:04.492 --> 18:07.260
<i>of the city's high-society silver spoons,</i>

18:07.295 --> 18:10.797
<i>then you're probably headed
to the Swiss Alps right now...</i>

18:10.832 --> 18:13.500
They've got them all running like rabbits.

18:13.534 --> 18:14.835
Yeah.

18:14.869 --> 18:16.703
I don't know why he chose an ungulate

18:16.738 --> 18:18.038
for his totem, but...

18:18.072 --> 18:19.506
he does know how to scare them, though.

18:19.540 --> 18:23.176
You do realize you happen
to be one of "them,"

18:23.211 --> 18:24.811
don't you, Master Bruce?

18:24.846 --> 18:26.980
Yeah, firstborn son of Gotham's rich

18:27.015 --> 18:28.115
and powerful.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.383
I don't know, maybe you should

18:29.417 --> 18:31.051
leave town for a little bit.

18:31.085 --> 18:33.787
Pop down to the lake house.
You like it there, don't you?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.956
I'm not going anywhere.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.325
I have work to do.

18:41.896 --> 18:43.964
Besides...

18:43.998 --> 18:46.099
why would the Goat take me?

18:46.134 --> 18:47.901
There's no one to take me from.

18:54.942 --> 18:56.910
Oh, my God.

18:56.944 --> 18:58.812
I'm improving your system.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.248
Implementing a rhizomatic cross-index,

19:01.282 --> 19:03.016
with your case files classified by subject,

19:03.051 --> 19:06.620
but arranged more like the
way a peat moss organism grows.

19:06.654 --> 19:08.488
You know, laterally.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.757
I had this entire room organized.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.392
Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic.

19:12.427 --> 19:13.560
Lateral.

19:13.594 --> 19:16.530
What did I ever do to you, Nygma?

19:16.564 --> 19:18.432
What did I do that compels you to come here

19:18.466 --> 19:20.267
with your endless notes and suggestions

19:20.301 --> 19:21.501
and riddles?

19:21.536 --> 19:23.337
My God, the riddles!

19:23.371 --> 19:25.339
Are you trying to get me to quit?

19:25.373 --> 19:28.175
- You can't want my job.
- No, no, no! I want you.

19:29.544 --> 19:32.579
To... keep your job

19:32.613 --> 19:34.448
and to have it. Here.

19:34.482 --> 19:36.850
For working.

19:40.955 --> 19:44.324
Okay, I'm getting the sense

19:44.359 --> 19:48.061
that this was somehow inappropriate.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.698
You are so odd.

19:55.336 --> 19:57.704
I'll just take my
non-hierarchical data paradigms

19:57.739 --> 19:59.373
out of your hair...

20:01.275 --> 20:04.793
and leave you to your work.

20:18.293 --> 20:22.229
GORDON: How long has it been
since you've seen this guy?

20:22.263 --> 20:23.664
Look, Bullock, I know what happened.

20:23.698 --> 20:25.198
Anybody in your situation...

20:25.233 --> 20:27.267
Listen, you think you can
shrink my head, Boy Scout?

20:27.302 --> 20:28.468
Because you can't.

20:28.503 --> 20:29.703
This is the black box, man.

20:29.737 --> 20:31.371
And we don't open the black box. Ever.

20:31.406 --> 20:32.506
Okay, fine.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.174
So, why don't you sit your ass down?

20:34.208 --> 20:35.642
I'll be back in a few minutes.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.112
We're both on this case.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.156
Dix.

20:49.190 --> 20:51.058
Hey...!

20:51.092 --> 20:53.627
What do we have here?

20:53.661 --> 20:57.798
Harvey Bullock, boy detective.

20:57.832 --> 20:59.066
Look at you up there, huh?

20:59.100 --> 21:00.133
Living the high life.

21:00.168 --> 21:02.002
And me down here,

21:02.036 --> 21:04.838
all broken up with a busted liver.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.673
Don't put that on me, old man.

21:06.708 --> 21:09.409
Your bum liver's between
you and the bottle.

21:09.444 --> 21:13.204
I just busted up your gams
and put you in that chair.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.716
Gotham's Golden Rule.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.018
No heroes, Bullock.

21:18.052 --> 21:20.053
No heroes.

21:20.088 --> 21:22.122
Listen, Dix.

21:22.156 --> 21:26.326
We have to talk about the case.

21:26.361 --> 21:27.728
About the Goat.

21:27.762 --> 21:28.929
I was wondering when you were going

21:28.963 --> 21:30.163
to come and ask for my help.

21:30.198 --> 21:31.598
I'm not asking for your help.

21:31.633 --> 21:33.300
That don't mean you don't need it.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.536
Who's this? Your partner?

21:36.571 --> 21:38.472
James Gordon. Nice to meet you.

21:38.506 --> 21:39.706
Come on, Dix.

21:39.741 --> 21:41.408
You ever tell anyone about Randall Milkie?

21:41.442 --> 21:42.643
The Liberty head pennies?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.645
We said we weren't
going to. We sealed them.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.680
I know we sealed them, you jackass!

21:48.082 --> 21:49.249
I told you to seal them.

21:49.284 --> 21:51.985
Okay, but this new killer's
doing the same thing.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.888
He's stitching up coins in
the heads of his victims.

21:54.923 --> 21:57.057
Any idea how he came up with that?

21:57.091 --> 21:59.760
I didn't tell anybody.

21:59.794 --> 22:01.762
Ed Hayes didn't tell nobody.

22:01.796 --> 22:03.564
And you didn't tell nobody.

22:03.598 --> 22:05.232
So, what the hell does that mean?

22:05.266 --> 22:08.101
It means we were wrong about Milkie.

22:08.136 --> 22:10.037
He was not working alone.

22:10.071 --> 22:11.271
No.

22:11.306 --> 22:12.472
Mm-hmm.

22:12.507 --> 22:15.342
You do not have a copycat killer here.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.745
You do not have a lone killer.

22:18.780 --> 22:21.882
What you have...

22:21.916 --> 22:23.417
is a conspiracy.

22:23.451 --> 22:25.552
BULLOCK: A conspiracy to hang

22:25.587 --> 22:28.355
rich kids off local historical landmarks?

22:28.389 --> 22:29.489
Yeah, right.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.927
He always thinks he's the
smartest one in the room.

22:33.962 --> 22:35.429
I know, right?

22:35.463 --> 22:39.433
That's because I'm always
in a room full of idiots.

22:41.369 --> 22:42.603
Watch out for him.

22:43.938 --> 22:45.772
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

22:45.807 --> 22:47.774
He's a loose cannon.

22:47.809 --> 22:50.811
He thinks he's a white
knight jumping into the breach

22:50.845 --> 22:53.647
like some idiot in the movies.

22:53.681 --> 22:55.616
You're talking about Bullock here?

22:55.650 --> 22:58.185
We're talking about Bullock here.

22:58.219 --> 22:59.686
Harvey Bullock?

22:59.721 --> 23:02.022
(quietly): Harvey Bullock, yeah.

23:02.056 --> 23:03.824
Detective Bullock, do you
want to settle the bill

23:03.858 --> 23:05.993
for this month now or
should we send it to you?

23:06.027 --> 23:07.828
You can just put it in the mail, thanks.

23:07.862 --> 23:10.063
Is he getting those magazines I ordered?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.332
Those are awful magazines, Detective.

23:12.367 --> 23:14.067
BULLOCK: But he's getting them?

23:14.102 --> 23:16.169
WOMAN: Yes. He is.

23:16.204 --> 23:18.138
Good.

23:20.308 --> 23:22.309
Thank you.

23:29.851 --> 23:31.852
No, Mom. I'm just grabbing a few things.

23:31.886 --> 23:34.154
Yes. Yes, I know.

23:34.188 --> 23:35.689
I'll be at the marina at 9:00.

23:35.723 --> 23:37.224
Okay.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.361
Here you are. Thank you, Anita.

23:41.396 --> 23:43.964
Oh, will you put some snack
stuff together, please?

24:19.200 --> 24:21.034
(creaking)

24:21.069 --> 24:23.437
Miss Ember?

24:36.918 --> 24:40.287
Anita, have you seen the
tops to my yellow silk...?

24:40.321 --> 24:43.023
Anita?

24:44.058 --> 24:45.392
(muffled shriek)

24:52.199 --> 24:54.567
<i>Ember Copley was supposed
to meet her parents tonight</i>

24:54.601 --> 24:56.402
at 9:00 at the marina.

24:56.436 --> 24:58.070
When she didn't show, they came back,

24:58.105 --> 25:00.239
found the maid out cold, Ember gone.

25:00.274 --> 25:02.575
- You think it's our guy?
- It's our guy.

25:02.609 --> 25:04.277
He slips in, chloroforms the maid,

25:04.311 --> 25:06.813
grabs Ember, no sign of B and E, nothing.

25:06.847 --> 25:07.847
Like a ghost.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.916
Like he had keys.

25:09.950 --> 25:11.651
Randall Milkie had a ritual.

25:11.685 --> 25:13.686
He'd dress the victims,
kill them and do his little

25:13.720 --> 25:15.521
coin trick... whole thing
took about eight hours.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.990
If our copy-Goat's doing the same thing,

25:18.025 --> 25:19.992
we're running out of time.

25:20.027 --> 25:22.195
I pulled the employee
list from the agencies

25:22.229 --> 25:23.996
that do maintenance on
Ember Copley's building.

25:24.031 --> 25:25.464
Looking for an employee that had

25:25.499 --> 25:27.433
access to both victims' apartments.

25:27.467 --> 25:29.168
That's a hell of a lot of people.

25:29.203 --> 25:30.870
Yeah, but our guy's been real busy.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.319
He had to have called in
sick the last couple days.

25:33.344 --> 25:36.419
Get Nygma in there. He's
freaking good with puzzles.

25:36.714 --> 25:37.781
You got it.

25:40.462 --> 25:42.430
Renee, we have to talk.

25:42.464 --> 25:43.665
- What are you doing here?
- Look, I know

25:43.699 --> 25:45.099
you think that he's done terrible things,

25:45.134 --> 25:47.268
but I also know you care about the truth.

25:47.302 --> 25:49.537
You shouldn't be here. Barbara,
you shouldn't be seen here.

25:49.571 --> 25:50.972
Damn it, Renee! Will you listen to me?!

25:52.641 --> 25:53.908
Look. I'll work with you, okay?

25:53.942 --> 25:54.942
I will tell you whatever

25:54.977 --> 25:56.778
I know, whatever I can find out.

25:56.812 --> 25:59.514
I need you to keep an open mind, okay?

25:59.548 --> 26:01.149
It's too late for that.

26:01.183 --> 26:03.651
Whatever's happening, okay,
you've got it wrong, Renee.

26:03.686 --> 26:06.154
You can't tell me, I know that,
but it isn't what you think.

26:06.188 --> 26:07.889
He's trying to protect me.

26:07.923 --> 26:09.891
Okay? He won't tell me who's out there.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.826
- Who he's afraid of.
- He's right not to.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.127
Wait. Why?

26:13.162 --> 26:14.996
Because it'll get you killed, okay?

26:15.030 --> 26:17.231
You understand what he knows,

26:17.266 --> 26:19.734
who he knows will kill you.

26:22.337 --> 26:24.839
We got a judge issuing a warrant tonight.

26:26.408 --> 26:28.076
Barbara, you know how
much I care about you.

26:28.110 --> 26:30.511
When Gordon gets arrested,
you have to get out of here.

26:30.546 --> 26:33.881
If Jim gets arrested, then this
is exactly where I have to be.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.049
By his side.

26:35.084 --> 26:37.151
Please, just leave.

26:37.186 --> 26:39.821
Get out of Gotham Just till this is over.

26:39.855 --> 26:41.489
And don't come to me again.

26:48.530 --> 26:49.764
<i>GORDON: Okay, so four guys</i>

26:49.798 --> 26:51.299
have called in sick since last week.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.334
The two suspects from the
outer boroughs are cleared.

26:53.368 --> 26:55.837
Another is out of state, but
apparently it's unconfirmed.

26:55.871 --> 26:57.038
So...

26:57.072 --> 26:59.006
So... that leaves one last guy.

26:59.041 --> 27:00.541
Raymond Earl.

27:00.576 --> 27:02.543
His shift supervisor

27:02.578 --> 27:04.112
says he's been squatting in a place

27:04.146 --> 27:06.047
near Cannery Park, somewhere
around the 1100 block.

27:06.081 --> 27:07.749
- That's him.
- You sure?

27:07.783 --> 27:09.951
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm 100% sure.

27:29.171 --> 27:31.072
Déjà voodoo all day long.

27:32.908 --> 27:37.044
This is where we got
Randall Milkie ten years ago.

27:37.079 --> 27:39.280
This is where Dix fell.

27:39.314 --> 27:41.215
Bullock.

27:43.218 --> 27:44.285
Got to go in.

27:44.319 --> 27:45.353
Come on.

27:45.387 --> 27:47.388
Yeah. Yeah.

27:50.592 --> 27:54.162
We're going to put you
to sleep for good now.

27:54.196 --> 27:57.965
You're lucky to be the sacrifice.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.567
(quiet moaning)

27:59.601 --> 28:02.103
(door opens)

28:31.533 --> 28:34.302
(birds' wings fluttering nearby)

28:36.305 --> 28:38.172
Go get her.

28:49.985 --> 28:51.652
You're safe.

28:55.591 --> 28:56.757
You all right? (mumbling)

28:56.792 --> 28:58.159
You okay?

29:06.401 --> 29:08.402
(Goat yells)

29:09.404 --> 29:11.472
(both grunting)

29:22.117 --> 29:24.752
You'll never stop the Goat.

29:26.755 --> 29:28.689
I will always come back.

29:28.724 --> 29:30.224
Quit saying that!

29:30.259 --> 29:32.093
(both grunting)

29:57.886 --> 30:00.588
Raymond Earl, you're under arrest.

30:02.224 --> 30:04.225
Not bad.

30:05.928 --> 30:07.929
All right.

30:09.698 --> 30:11.699
All right.

30:22.604 --> 30:24.605
(door opens)

30:33.849 --> 30:36.818
(moaning nearby)

30:47.796 --> 30:50.031
(footsteps nearby)

31:24.566 --> 31:27.034
(footsteps approaching)

31:51.627 --> 31:53.995
(door opens)

31:55.097 --> 31:57.065
(door closes)

31:57.099 --> 31:59.233
Your suit is ready.

31:59.268 --> 32:01.502
I steamed it nice.

32:01.537 --> 32:03.404
Thanks, Mom.

32:08.444 --> 32:11.112
I'm worried for you.

32:11.146 --> 32:14.148
So anxious you look.

32:14.183 --> 32:17.952
These moves you make,

32:17.986 --> 32:20.221
they're safe, yes?

32:20.255 --> 32:23.291
You're not doing anything illegal?

32:23.325 --> 32:26.527
No, Mom. Don't worry. It's just business.

32:26.562 --> 32:29.030
Well, business is all very fine,

32:29.064 --> 32:31.199
but always remember...

32:31.233 --> 32:33.868
you can trust no one.

32:33.902 --> 32:35.903
No one but your mother.

32:35.938 --> 32:38.172
I know. (laughs gently)

32:38.207 --> 32:39.574
I know.

32:41.944 --> 32:44.412
But you know what?

32:44.446 --> 32:46.981
I think I finally found
somebody I can trust.

32:48.484 --> 32:49.984
A policeman.

32:50.018 --> 32:52.120
Police?

32:52.154 --> 32:53.621
The police are liars.

32:53.655 --> 32:56.224
Hmm-mm, not this one, Mom.

32:56.258 --> 32:57.558
He's a real friend.

32:57.593 --> 32:59.364
Hmm.

32:59.402 --> 33:02.230
He'll help me come out right in the end.

33:09.872 --> 33:12.240
GORDON: Raymond Earl, 33 years old,

33:12.274 --> 33:13.408
janitor in the city.

33:13.442 --> 33:15.977
Works with an agency

33:16.011 --> 33:17.578
that services the
buildings of both victims.

33:17.613 --> 33:19.213
And he's not talking.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.648
BULLOCK: History of mental illness,

33:20.683 --> 33:23.184
misdemeanor arrests
for lewd and lascivious,

33:23.218 --> 33:24.519
public disturbance.

33:24.553 --> 33:26.421
ESSEN: Thank you, Jesus.

33:26.455 --> 33:28.423
You got him. Good work,

33:28.457 --> 33:29.857
Detectives.

33:29.892 --> 33:31.993
I got a lot of phone calls to make.

33:32.027 --> 33:34.028
Bullock, look happier.

33:38.867 --> 33:41.602
(sighs)

33:42.738 --> 33:44.038
(door closes)

33:44.073 --> 33:45.306
What?

33:45.341 --> 33:47.842
Randall Milkie worked
for a maintenance company

33:47.876 --> 33:49.644
that serviced the buildings of his victims,

33:49.678 --> 33:51.813
same as Raymond here.

33:51.847 --> 33:53.514
Milkie was mentally ill,

33:53.549 --> 33:55.683
no violent crimes in his history,

33:55.718 --> 33:56.818
same as him.

33:56.852 --> 33:59.354
Ten years apart, they never meet,

33:59.388 --> 34:01.122
then one day, suddenly, out of the blue,

34:01.156 --> 34:03.157
they both decide to become the Goat?

34:05.194 --> 34:07.328
It's like...

34:07.363 --> 34:09.397
it's like something found them.

34:09.431 --> 34:10.732
Changed them.

34:10.766 --> 34:13.440
You talking about Dix
and his conspiracy theory?

34:13.465 --> 34:16.467
No. It just doesn't add up.

34:16.501 --> 34:19.036
And how'd he know about the coin?

34:19.071 --> 34:20.471
I know that we're missing something,

34:20.505 --> 34:22.273
and if we keep missing it,

34:22.306 --> 34:24.074
I'm afraid we're never gonna stop this.

34:24.109 --> 34:25.076
Okay.

34:25.110 --> 34:26.577
We go back to Milkie's files.

34:26.612 --> 34:29.112
We, uh... look for possible accomplices,

34:29.147 --> 34:31.047
uh, connections... Tomorrow, tomorrow.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.284
I, uh, just... I need... I need to think.

34:34.620 --> 34:37.188
Why don't you, uh, get some rest?

34:39.123 --> 34:40.625
Yeah.

34:42.094 --> 34:44.762
- Night.
- Good night, Jim.

34:44.795 --> 34:45.795
(door opens)

34:47.498 --> 34:49.199
(door closes)

35:00.979 --> 35:03.047
No. No.

35:03.081 --> 35:05.583
No. No.

35:05.617 --> 35:06.884
Oh, no.

35:06.919 --> 35:09.353
No. No.

35:09.388 --> 35:10.354
(gasps)

35:10.389 --> 35:12.089
No. No.

35:12.124 --> 35:13.124
(grunts)

35:14.159 --> 35:16.160
Holy Ghost on a bicycle.

35:30.075 --> 35:31.075
Barbara?

35:31.109 --> 35:32.777
Jim, look.

35:32.811 --> 35:34.278
I don't know everything, but I know enough.

35:34.313 --> 35:35.880
You have to listen to me now.

35:35.914 --> 35:38.983
- Baby, I can barely stand.
- Montoya has a witness.

35:39.017 --> 35:40.718
What?

35:40.752 --> 35:43.020
They really believe you
killed this Cobblepot person.

35:43.055 --> 35:45.089
- I didn't.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

35:45.123 --> 35:47.310
They've got a warrant for your arrest.

35:48.227 --> 35:49.927
What aren't you telling me?

35:52.649 --> 35:55.351
For weeks now, it's like
you've been a different person.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.453
Something happened not long after

35:57.488 --> 35:59.088
you started the job.

35:59.123 --> 36:00.757
Something... something you

36:00.791 --> 36:02.158
don't feel right about.

36:02.192 --> 36:03.693
Somehow, they've cornered me.

36:03.727 --> 36:05.779
- Tied my hands.
- Come with me now. Okay?

36:05.816 --> 36:07.884
I don't care what I
leave behind, as long as

36:07.918 --> 36:09.152
we leave it together.

36:09.186 --> 36:10.620
If they take you away, Jim,

36:10.654 --> 36:12.388
- I'm scared I'll lose you.
- (knocking at door)

36:12.423 --> 36:14.023
- Barbara...
- Please!

36:14.058 --> 36:16.526
(knocking continues)

36:16.560 --> 36:18.695
I can't run.

36:23.067 --> 36:24.967
Can't run.

36:36.146 --> 36:38.448
James Gordon... you're under arrest

36:38.482 --> 36:40.416
for the murder of Oswald
Chesterfield Cobblepot.

36:40.451 --> 36:41.484
(handcuffs clicking)

36:41.518 --> 36:43.553
You have the right to remain silent.

36:43.587 --> 36:45.254
Anything you say can be used against you

36:45.289 --> 36:47.223
in a court of law.

36:52.663 --> 36:54.664
(door creaks, slams shut)

37:03.714 --> 37:05.715
<i>DR. MARKS: You're drifting down</i>

37:05.750 --> 37:07.784
and away... deeper...

37:07.818 --> 37:09.586
I got it.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.254
I'm sorry to interrupt.

37:11.288 --> 37:13.192
- It's Detective Bullock, isn't it?
- Yeah.

37:13.229 --> 37:15.461
Did you want to interview Mr. Hastings?

37:15.486 --> 37:16.452
Actually, your secretary told me

37:16.487 --> 37:18.254
I might be able to find you here.

37:18.288 --> 37:20.523
I was hoping to pick
your brain about the case.

37:20.557 --> 37:22.425
Oh. Uh, I'll just be a minute.

37:22.459 --> 37:23.459
It's okay.

37:27.638 --> 37:29.806
I didn't realize this before.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.274
You're a hypnotist, right?

37:31.308 --> 37:32.976
A hypnotherapist.

37:33.010 --> 37:35.612
Oh, therapist. It's a
funny word, therapist.

37:35.646 --> 37:39.115
Can either mean "therapist"
or "the rapist," if...

37:39.150 --> 37:41.651
So you do

37:41.685 --> 37:43.687
pro Bono work at an outpatient clinic?

37:43.721 --> 37:46.289
- Or a couple of them?
- I do. I try to give back.

37:46.323 --> 37:49.459
Yeah, you've been giving
back for a while, uh...

37:49.493 --> 37:51.161
- 12 years now.
- Mm-hmm.

37:51.195 --> 37:52.929
That's good.

37:52.963 --> 37:54.564
To be honest, I...

37:54.598 --> 37:57.934
wanted to talk to you about
one of your pro Bono patients.

37:57.968 --> 37:58.935
Uh, Raymond Earl?

37:58.969 --> 38:01.104
He's a person of interest

38:01.138 --> 38:03.106
in our investigation.

38:03.140 --> 38:06.543
Our records indicate you've seen him, uh...

38:06.577 --> 38:07.811
at least a few times, right?

38:07.845 --> 38:09.979
Hmm... sounds familiar.

38:10.014 --> 38:11.147
Last year, maybe?

38:11.182 --> 38:13.483
And Mr. Hastings, Amanda's father...

38:13.517 --> 38:15.485
we know he's your patient.

38:15.519 --> 38:16.820
When we were here yesterday,

38:16.854 --> 38:18.154
he was doing something really curious.

38:18.189 --> 38:19.489
It, uh...

38:19.523 --> 38:21.691
he, uh... he kept clenching his fist.

38:21.726 --> 38:23.226
Over and over.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.228
- Yes, he does that.
- Yeah.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.830
See, I was reading about that,

38:26.864 --> 38:29.399
and it said that if a
patient has a compulsion,

38:29.433 --> 38:31.668
like a bad idea or an impulse,

38:31.702 --> 38:33.002
that the hypnotist could

38:33.037 --> 38:34.671
put the poor sap under

38:34.705 --> 38:37.173
and introduce a... a physical movement.

38:37.208 --> 38:40.009
Like, uh, clenching your fist.

38:40.044 --> 38:41.211
So instead of doing what

38:41.245 --> 38:43.380
the compulsion wants the person to do,

38:43.414 --> 38:45.682
they just...

38:45.716 --> 38:47.016
clench their fist.

38:47.051 --> 38:49.252
That's how it works, pretty much.

38:49.286 --> 38:51.921
So Mr. Hastings, when he's in a, uh,

38:51.956 --> 38:53.890
room full of people and he wants to start

38:53.924 --> 38:55.792
screaming his head off, I don't know,

38:55.826 --> 38:58.528
instead of doing that, he just...

38:58.562 --> 39:00.096
Mm-hmm.

39:00.131 --> 39:01.798
Yeah.

39:01.832 --> 39:03.099
Okay.

39:03.134 --> 39:04.734
What about Raymond Earl?

39:04.769 --> 39:06.403
Why does he clench his fist?

39:08.372 --> 39:10.240
And what about Randall Milkie?

39:11.876 --> 39:14.511
See, I know you treated him
a little over ten years ago,

39:14.545 --> 39:15.945
and I want you to follow me

39:15.980 --> 39:17.480
because this part gets a little weird.

39:17.515 --> 39:19.682
See, I think a hypnotist
completely turned both those men

39:19.717 --> 39:21.551
upside down.

39:21.585 --> 39:23.920
Until their own identity was the bad idea,

39:23.954 --> 39:26.523
and then it wasn't even them
clenching their fists anymore.

39:26.557 --> 39:28.892
It was the Spirit of the Goat.

39:28.926 --> 39:30.360
Hmm.

39:30.394 --> 39:32.862
I underestimated you.

39:34.965 --> 39:36.199
(laughs) I really did.

39:36.233 --> 39:38.802
So I'm right.

39:38.836 --> 39:39.803
Aha!

39:39.837 --> 39:41.237
Yes, I'm right.

39:41.272 --> 39:43.506
And so you trolled all
the outpatient clinics

39:43.541 --> 39:45.275
so you could find a
suitable borderline case

39:45.309 --> 39:47.010
like Randall Milkie.

39:47.044 --> 39:48.712
And then you hypnotize the poor bastard

39:48.746 --> 39:50.814
until he literally doesn't
even know who he is.

39:50.848 --> 39:52.482
And then I tell him who he is.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.317
That's pretty good intellection, Detective.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.652
Why?

39:55.686 --> 39:58.354
Why hypnotize a janitor

39:58.389 --> 40:00.056
and turn him into the Goat?

40:00.091 --> 40:02.926
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.662
It isn't an act of murder or madness.

40:05.696 --> 40:06.830
It's an act of therapy.

40:06.864 --> 40:09.632
- Therapy? For who?
- For Gotham.

40:09.667 --> 40:11.835
Excuse me?

40:11.869 --> 40:14.437
This city used to have hope,

40:14.472 --> 40:16.106
and they gunned it down in the streets.

40:16.140 --> 40:18.108
The rich, the powerful.

40:18.142 --> 40:19.976
Their greed is pathological,

40:20.010 --> 40:22.679
an id run rampant, eating Gotham alive.

40:22.713 --> 40:24.614
So your one-percent solution

40:24.648 --> 40:26.249
is to kill the city's rich kids?

40:26.283 --> 40:28.384
Negative reinforcement.

40:28.419 --> 40:31.221
To believe that the Goat is real,

40:31.255 --> 40:33.423
that it wouldn't tolerate this...

40:33.457 --> 40:34.924
Gotham wanted that.

40:34.959 --> 40:36.960
No matter how painful it was.

40:38.129 --> 40:40.296
It's true what they say.

40:40.331 --> 40:41.664
You can't really hypnotize somebody

40:41.699 --> 40:42.999
to do something that, deep down,

40:43.033 --> 40:45.668
they don't already want to do.

40:45.703 --> 40:47.437
And deep down,

40:47.471 --> 40:49.973
we all want to eat the rich.

40:51.008 --> 40:53.243
Don't we?

40:53.277 --> 40:56.513
You are 100% nuthouse crazy, lady.

40:57.575 --> 41:00.183
Dr. Marks... is everything okay?

41:00.217 --> 41:01.651
No, it's not.

41:01.685 --> 41:03.787
Dr. Marks, you're under arrest

41:03.821 --> 41:06.222
for conspiracy to commit murder, coercion

41:06.257 --> 41:07.624
and, frankly, a few things

41:07.658 --> 41:09.359
we're probably gonna
have to name after you.

41:09.393 --> 41:10.994
Well, I do have another one for you.

41:11.028 --> 41:15.665
Robert, the golden temple is open.

41:15.699 --> 41:17.133
Now kill this man.

41:18.502 --> 41:19.469
(growling)

41:19.503 --> 41:20.703
Robert...

41:24.041 --> 41:25.775
Heel, Mr. Hastings! Heel!

41:25.810 --> 41:27.510
(grunting)

41:33.551 --> 41:34.984
(yelling)

41:35.019 --> 41:37.086
(grunts)

41:38.622 --> 41:40.156
Freeze, lady!

41:40.191 --> 41:43.827
(screaming)

41:46.430 --> 41:48.398
<i>ESSEN: One more time.</i>

41:48.432 --> 41:49.966
Take me through the part

41:50.000 --> 41:51.835
where you drove to the nice part of town

41:51.869 --> 41:54.003
and shot the doctor lady.

41:54.038 --> 41:55.638
We caught the other half of the killer.

41:55.673 --> 41:57.273
Dr. Marks was the Spirit of the Goat.

41:57.308 --> 41:59.342
Okay, see, that's the
part that I don't... get.

41:59.376 --> 42:01.744
On the same side, do you understand?

42:01.779 --> 42:02.879
We're fighting the same war,

42:02.913 --> 42:04.547
and damn it, I'm getting somewhere.

42:04.582 --> 42:06.716
Getting into a six-by-eight
in the Blackgate Pen,

42:06.750 --> 42:08.051
that's what you're getting.

42:08.085 --> 42:09.853
- What is this?
- MCU's taking

42:09.887 --> 42:11.621
Detective James Gordon into custody.

42:11.655 --> 42:13.690
- What?
- Your boy here murdered

42:13.724 --> 42:15.625
Oswald Cobblepot and
dumped him in the river.

42:15.659 --> 42:16.793
That's a damn lie!

42:16.827 --> 42:18.194
He's right. It was a lie.

42:18.229 --> 42:21.231
I didn't shoot Oswald Cobblepot.

42:21.265 --> 42:23.433
I lied. I didn't shoot him, Bullock.

42:23.467 --> 42:26.302
- Of course you didn't, partner.
- No, I mean it!

42:26.337 --> 42:27.704
Harvey Bullock, you're under arrest.

42:27.738 --> 42:28.771
For what?

42:28.806 --> 42:30.073
Accomplice in the murder
of Oswald Cobblepot.

42:30.107 --> 42:32.876
Our witness places you at the scene.

42:32.910 --> 42:34.277
ESSEN: You think you can

42:34.311 --> 42:35.778
walk in here and take my people

42:35.813 --> 42:37.714
- like that?
- We're not here to take down the GCPD.

42:37.748 --> 42:39.048
We just want these two.

42:39.083 --> 42:42.151
Well, they're GCPD, so
the MCU's got a problem.

42:42.186 --> 42:44.254
Yeah, you got a problem. You
got a real problem, you...

42:46.290 --> 42:47.891
Holy crap.

42:47.925 --> 42:49.592
Hello.

42:49.627 --> 42:51.694
(chuckles)

42:51.727 --> 42:54.463
I am Oswald Cobblepot.

42:58.873 --> 43:01.145
- Son of a bitch.
- Harvey...

43:01.183 --> 43:02.601
Son of a bitch!
