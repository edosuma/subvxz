Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:11.010 --> 01:13.577
That's me,

01:13.579 --> 01:14.981
yours truly.

01:15.983 --> 01:18.582
And this is where I work.

01:18.584 --> 01:20.618
A beautiful office.

01:20.620 --> 01:23.654
And that's me in Iceland

01:23.656 --> 01:26.957
filming for an Extra ten days
because of the damn volcano.

01:26.959 --> 01:29.728
Uh, there's me in Venezuela.

01:29.730 --> 01:33.031
And that's me in...

01:33.033 --> 01:33.832
...that's gotta be New Jersey.

01:33.834 --> 01:34.832
What the hell's
that doin' there?

01:34.834 --> 01:36.168
You're doing
some work over there?

01:36.170 --> 01:38.904
'Cause for a second it sounded
like you were doing some work.

01:38.906 --> 01:40.738
Oh there's Jimmy.

01:40.740 --> 01:43.008
Jimmy is really angry

01:43.010 --> 01:45.677
because he has to fly all the
way to South Dakota tonight

01:45.679 --> 01:48.746
with his tiny little computer.
Does that actually work?

01:48.748 --> 01:51.550
It's Jim, not Jimmy.

01:51.552 --> 01:54.019
I don't know why you all keep
adding Y to the end of my name.

01:54.987 --> 01:57.022
Jimmy, you have the schedule?

01:57.024 --> 01:59.758
What does it look
like I'm doing, Lizzy?

01:59.760 --> 02:02.761
Alright, where's your
Halloween spirit, guys?

02:02.763 --> 02:06.630
And this is our know-it-
all assistant director, Liz,

02:06.632 --> 02:09.667
the pain in the ass-sistant.

02:09.669 --> 02:11.102
Very funny.

02:11.104 --> 02:12.937
What do you got there,
smart-ass Tom?

02:12.939 --> 02:13.939
A new toy, a new toy.

02:13.941 --> 02:16.107
Is that the new camera
you were talking about?

02:16.109 --> 02:17.142
- You know it.
- Let me see.

02:17.144 --> 02:18.609
Hey hey, be careful!

02:18.611 --> 02:20.044
When'd you get it?

02:20.046 --> 02:22.346
A few days ago.
Just testing it out.

02:22.348 --> 02:23.815
Oh, yeah? What
have you shot so far?

02:23.817 --> 02:26.984
Uh, you know, not much.

02:26.986 --> 02:29.054
Just, you know, enough to know
that it works.

02:29.056 --> 02:31.655
- Oh, yeah? Let me see.
- Wait! Non wait!

02:34.794 --> 02:35.893
You go, cowboy.

02:35.895 --> 02:38.532
Get over here, cowgirl.

02:39.066 --> 02:40.631
You're out of control.

02:40.633 --> 02:41.766
Ah!

02:43.836 --> 02:46.071
All right, give it here.

02:46.073 --> 02:48.072
You go, Tommy... cowboy.

02:48.074 --> 02:52.546
You know what, Liz?
You-you-you play too much.

02:53.747 --> 02:54.946
Not a word!

02:58.151 --> 03:00.588
- Hey Tommy, what's up?
- What's up, Dan?

03:03.757 --> 03:06.391
Hey Pesce,
lets talk about that...

03:06.393 --> 03:07.762
...thing later.

03:08.694 --> 03:10.995
Hello, ladies.
What do we have here?

03:10.997 --> 03:14.131
Some video,
supposedly from China.

03:16.402 --> 03:18.769
Don't film me Tommy,
I'm a mess.

03:18.771 --> 03:20.106
Okay.

03:21.207 --> 03:22.973
You better erase that footage.

03:22.975 --> 03:24.645
I'll think about it.

03:25.711 --> 03:27.178
Mike pretending
to do some work.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.780
Tommy, dude there is this
awesome, awesome party later.

03:29.782 --> 03:32.586
It's not a party if you're
the only one there, buddy.

03:35.921 --> 03:37.123
Hi.

03:38.792 --> 03:42.661
May I have
some privacy, please?

03:42.663 --> 03:45.729
You know, in some cultures
it's traditional to knock.

03:45.731 --> 03:48.166
Hey, we have a new nickname
for you around the office,

03:48.168 --> 03:50.435
Mr. Smiles!

03:53.706 --> 03:56.143
Tommy is scared of Karen.

03:57.911 --> 03:58.846
She's his boss.

03:59.712 --> 04:03.148
Okay, um, I'll call you
once we arrive.

04:03.150 --> 04:05.449
Make sure you tell Simon to
bring additional battery packs.

04:05.451 --> 04:06.351
Right.

04:06.353 --> 04:07.185
You have no
idea how much shit

04:07.187 --> 04:08.286
that situation
caused us last time.

04:08.288 --> 04:11.955
Did you get a chance
to read my treatment

04:11.957 --> 04:15.292
for the show idea that I had?

04:15.294 --> 04:17.961
Uh, I feel it needs
more structure.

04:17.963 --> 04:19.264
I mean, I could potentially
take it to Nolan,

04:19.266 --> 04:22.466
but you have to punch it up.

04:22.468 --> 04:24.769
Come up with some scenarios.

04:24.771 --> 04:25.803
Yeah, I mean,
that's the thing,

04:25.805 --> 04:27.805
I wanted it to be
as spontaneous as possible.

04:27.807 --> 04:29.274
You know sometimes
when you over-plan something,

04:29.276 --> 04:30.841
you kind of...

04:30.843 --> 04:32.010
The greatest moments,
they kind of-

04:32.012 --> 04:33.478
they kind of disappear.
I just feel like...

04:33.480 --> 04:36.947
Take it from someone who's been in
reality television for some time.

04:36.949 --> 04:38.716
Structure is substance

04:38.718 --> 04:40.784
or your friends if you
wanna make those sales.

04:40.786 --> 04:44.024
One man, one camera concept
just isn't enough.

04:46.759 --> 04:49.159
What's this?
Very cool camera.

04:49.161 --> 04:50.728
Yeah,
it's not even released yet.

04:50.730 --> 04:51.863
I mentioned I was
from Nolan Productions

04:51.865 --> 04:53.098
and they hooked me up.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.332
So, how is it?

04:55.334 --> 04:56.166
Oh, it's amazing.

04:56.168 --> 04:58.303
It's...
The handling is incredible,

04:58.305 --> 05:00.337
it's amazing in low light.

05:00.339 --> 05:02.774
Um, I figure I'll
test it out a little bit more

05:02.776 --> 05:05.276
and maybe recommend it for Kris' show.
I think it'd be great.

05:05.278 --> 05:06.911
Where are you going again?

05:06.913 --> 05:09.180
Catskills, it's a couple hours
up north.

05:09.182 --> 05:10.214
Uh, just me and a college buddy.

05:10.216 --> 05:12.851
There's nothing but tents
and woods this year.

05:12.853 --> 05:14.084
That's creepy.

05:14.086 --> 05:15.185
Karen, isn't it a little unfair

05:15.187 --> 05:17.221
that we will be working
three more days than Tommy?

05:17.223 --> 05:19.957
I am also scouting locations
for Kris' show.

05:19.959 --> 05:23.861
Yeah, right. Kris
is not going upstate.

05:23.863 --> 05:26.096
Well, whatever works, right?

05:26.098 --> 05:27.966
I'll see you in Dakota
in three days.

05:27.968 --> 05:29.103
You got it.

05:31.071 --> 05:32.139
Give me that.

05:35.809 --> 05:39.046
You have to stop
sucking up to her, man.

05:42.115 --> 05:44.248
Little Asian babies,
is that what you want?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.250
This thing's incredible.

05:45.252 --> 05:47.017
- Tommy.
- Yeah.

05:47.019 --> 05:50.120
I met this chick
on the train...

05:50.122 --> 05:52.223
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

05:52.225 --> 05:53.858
No, you didn't.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.058
So, anyways, like
I was saying, dude,

05:55.060 --> 05:57.361
I said, "Yeah?"

05:57.363 --> 05:59.897
and she was like, "Yeah."

05:59.899 --> 06:02.966
And I was like, "Yes!"

06:02.968 --> 06:04.836
Sounds like an
intelligent conversation.

06:04.838 --> 06:07.005
Is it-is it difficult
to get the girls

06:07.007 --> 06:09.973
to come into your basement
to play Dungeons and Dragons?

06:09.975 --> 06:12.278
Um, yes... it is.

06:13.279 --> 06:16.014
But I got these pills, dude,
you just crush up

06:16.016 --> 06:17.848
and slip in their drink when they're...

06:17.850 --> 06:19.216
How have you not been arrested?

06:19.218 --> 06:20.084
What?

06:20.086 --> 06:22.019
How have you not been arrested?

06:22.021 --> 06:22.853
I've been arrested.

06:22.855 --> 06:24.257
Check it out.

06:34.367 --> 06:36.166
It's so light, man.

06:36.168 --> 06:37.901
It was inspired by my idea.

06:37.903 --> 06:39.370
I sent the concept
to a designer in Germany.

06:39.372 --> 06:42.005
- Sweet.
- Right?

06:42.007 --> 06:44.375
You have
a wild imagination, bro.

06:44.377 --> 06:45.877
Are you taking this with you?

06:45.879 --> 06:47.144
Yeah.

06:47.146 --> 06:48.413
Are you taking me with you?

06:48.415 --> 06:49.884
No.

06:55.055 --> 06:57.055
Always late.

06:57.057 --> 06:59.826
There she is... finally.

07:00.427 --> 07:01.726
I got it, don't worry.

07:01.728 --> 07:04.295
What? You think, I'm gonna
help and get this baby towed?

07:04.297 --> 07:06.363
Oh, yeah, no,
not this chick magnet.

07:06.365 --> 07:07.998
Hey, it worked on you.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.199
Filming already? I see, huh.

07:09.201 --> 07:11.002
Of course.

07:11.004 --> 07:12.904
You're carrying everything
when we get there, okay?

07:12.906 --> 07:14.005
It's not gonna happen.

07:14.007 --> 07:15.406
Oh, but it is.

07:19.913 --> 07:21.913
Like, that
face gives it all away.

07:23.916 --> 07:25.115
No, I'm sure, I'm sure,

07:25.117 --> 07:26.317
Mr. Innocent over here.

07:26.319 --> 07:28.019
- Hey!
- You know, I can just imagine...

07:28.021 --> 07:29.454
I bet you talk about about...

07:29.456 --> 07:31.158
Ugh, you're such a pig!

07:32.358 --> 07:34.959
And, action.

07:34.961 --> 07:36.226
Come on! I said action.

07:38.098 --> 07:40.031
Oh, you're being shy now?

07:40.033 --> 07:41.399
You weren't that shy
last night.

07:41.401 --> 07:43.935
Oh, you know me. Only when
I have my lucky boxers on.

07:43.937 --> 07:45.370
Oh no, please, not those.

07:45.372 --> 07:48.106
I had nightmares about those
all night long.

07:48.108 --> 07:49.940
I have to get rid of them.

07:49.942 --> 07:52.243
Y-you did erase it, right?

07:52.245 --> 07:54.111
- Yeah. Of course!
- Right?

07:54.113 --> 07:55.046
Yeah, you better.

07:55.048 --> 07:57.115
Okay, so, since you
don't want to talk,

07:57.117 --> 07:59.317
I will make the introductions.

07:59.319 --> 08:02.387
We are talking
to Mr. Thomas Rivas,

08:02.389 --> 08:06.223
a video journalist
and a producer

08:06.225 --> 08:09.928
of a new
highly acclaimed reality series,

08:09.930 --> 08:13.498
Kris the Adventure Man,
or Guy or something.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.233
An associate producer, actually.

08:15.235 --> 08:17.104
All right, shut up, Tommy.

08:20.206 --> 08:22.440
And here to my right, we have Ms.
Monica Tanner.

08:22.442 --> 08:24.142
My girl of a year and a half.

08:24.144 --> 08:26.945
Um, a graduate business student,

08:26.947 --> 08:28.512
an aspiring actor,

08:28.514 --> 08:31.182
and a pretty good belly dancer
on weekends.

08:31.184 --> 08:33.183
Shut up, I took one class.

08:33.186 --> 08:34.551
Keep your eye on the road, okay?

08:34.553 --> 08:37.522
The show's not dumb, all right?
Its real life adventures.

08:37.524 --> 08:39.556
Danger. Survival.

08:39.558 --> 08:40.691
Please, please.

08:40.693 --> 08:44.027
You know I'm not buying ad
time from you, so, please.

08:44.029 --> 08:46.196
By the way, did you talk to Karen
about your new show concept?

08:46.198 --> 08:48.266
No not yet.
Take this for a sec.

08:53.105 --> 08:54.305
Hey, bud.

08:54.307 --> 08:56.007
Yeah, yeah, we're close.

08:56.009 --> 08:57.208
How about that snow, man?

08:57.210 --> 08:59.209
Is he with Rachel?

08:59.211 --> 09:00.310
No. Sam.

09:00.312 --> 09:01.345
I told you. Come on.

09:01.347 --> 09:04.015
How many women
does he have, Exactly?

09:04.017 --> 09:05.483
What do you mean?
You know Sam.

09:05.485 --> 09:07.752
Oh yeah, I know Sam, Rachel

09:07.754 --> 09:09.988
and, um, oh yeah, Gloria too.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.022
Gloria is just a friend of his.

09:11.024 --> 09:14.224
Okay, a friend
with benefits, maybe.

09:14.226 --> 09:15.759
Uh, whatever works.

09:15.761 --> 09:18.061
Whoa, Excuse me.

09:18.063 --> 09:20.330
You better not
have any friends like that.

09:20.332 --> 09:22.499
Uh, what's that face for?

09:22.501 --> 09:24.435
- I'm just kidding.
- Yeah.

09:24.437 --> 09:26.070
We're gonna freeze.

09:26.072 --> 09:28.473
I love it out here.

09:28.475 --> 09:30.043
Oh, shit!

09:32.578 --> 09:35.179
Who is that sExy mechanic?

09:35.181 --> 09:38.148
What? Seriously?

09:38.150 --> 09:39.483
You're gonna do this now?

09:39.485 --> 09:41.219
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

09:41.221 --> 09:43.286
This is in my blood.
My instinct.

09:43.288 --> 09:47.525
No, get your ass over here
right now.

09:47.527 --> 09:48.693
Let's go.

09:48.695 --> 09:50.060
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

09:50.062 --> 09:51.295
Be gentle.

09:51.297 --> 09:52.597
Report to us, Thomas.

09:52.599 --> 09:57.502
Uh, at approximately 17:09,

09:57.504 --> 10:01.171
um, the car suddenly jerked

10:01.173 --> 10:03.342
and it appears as though
we've hit something.

10:04.374 --> 10:06.310
Right, and you
screamed like a little girl.

10:06.312 --> 10:09.180
For the record,
that never happened.

10:09.182 --> 10:12.050
And now we're
examining the tire

10:12.052 --> 10:13.550
to make sure all is well.

10:13.552 --> 10:17.088
I can actually breathe up here.

10:17.090 --> 10:20.123
The air is so much cleaner
than in the city.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.996
I can't believe it snowed
in October.

10:24.297 --> 10:25.530
Since when does that happen?

10:25.532 --> 10:26.830
I think we hit a rock
or something.

10:26.832 --> 10:28.534
There's a scratch here.

10:31.336 --> 10:32.570
Babe, you see that?

10:32.572 --> 10:34.508
Babe...

10:37.543 --> 10:40.210
There's-there's
some kid over there.

10:41.514 --> 10:43.414
He was just...

10:43.416 --> 10:47.151
There was just a boy standing over
there by the tree staring at us.

10:47.153 --> 10:48.618
I don't know, maybe he
was lost or something.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.320
That's so bizarre.

10:50.322 --> 10:51.455
Lost, out here?

10:51.457 --> 10:54.528
I don't know. He
was there, now he's not.

10:55.628 --> 10:57.163
Uh...

10:57.697 --> 10:59.397
Hey!

10:59.399 --> 11:01.398
Anybody there?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.267
Come on, we gotta go.
Ex is gonna bitch.

11:03.269 --> 11:05.670
Look, I'm telling you
there's a little boy out there.

11:05.672 --> 11:07.338
All right, well,
he's not here now.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.143
Come on, we gotta get moving.

11:09.576 --> 11:10.675
All right.

11:10.677 --> 11:12.410
Let's hit the road.

11:12.412 --> 11:15.246
And we're off... again.

11:15.248 --> 11:17.448
Sounds okay.

11:17.450 --> 11:18.648
Is your seat belt buckled?

11:18.650 --> 11:20.417
Yup.

11:20.419 --> 11:21.585
I hate living in the city.

11:21.587 --> 11:23.356
Oh...

11:28.327 --> 11:30.430
There he is freaking out.

11:31.331 --> 11:32.629
Look at that outfit.

11:32.631 --> 11:34.498
Oh, he looks so mad.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.199
What is he wearing?

11:40.506 --> 11:42.175
Sorry we're late.

11:46.211 --> 11:48.478
And his impatience is limitless.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.381
What, you don't know how to
use your cell phone, man?

11:50.383 --> 11:53.283
I been standing out here for over
an hour freezing my balls off.

11:53.285 --> 11:55.152
Oh, you mean your ball?

11:55.154 --> 11:56.253
Your secret is out, my friend.

11:56.255 --> 11:57.622
- What are you, a comedian now?
- You miss it?

11:57.624 --> 11:59.190
What is this, dude?

11:59.192 --> 12:00.724
This, my friend, is his new toy.

12:00.726 --> 12:02.560
Hi, how are you?

12:02.562 --> 12:04.661
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

12:04.663 --> 12:06.363
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, how you doing?

12:06.365 --> 12:07.632
You don't get enough
of this shit at work, man?

12:07.634 --> 12:08.632
Never, man.

12:08.634 --> 12:11.268
I-I don't see any snow.

12:11.270 --> 12:12.637
I'm telling
you it was snowing.

12:12.639 --> 12:13.738
It was totally snowing.

12:13.740 --> 12:15.739
You didn't see any snow
because it's not gonna snow.

12:15.741 --> 12:17.407
It's not going to snow.

12:17.409 --> 12:19.643
And you are dressed
perfectly for the occasion

12:19.645 --> 12:21.478
for filming
your first Banana Republic...

12:21.480 --> 12:22.313
- Oh, let me see!
- Will you turn that off?

12:22.315 --> 12:23.480
- Congratulations.
- Oh, Jesus.

12:23.482 --> 12:24.648
Yes, camping. Absolutely.

12:24.650 --> 12:25.483
All right, all right. You know what?
You're jealous.

12:25.485 --> 12:26.584
There's nothing
you can do about it.

12:26.586 --> 12:28.419
I'll be jealous
when you freeze to death.

12:28.421 --> 12:29.853
Ex has been so busy...

12:29.855 --> 12:32.390
- Right, I been busy.
- What have you been busy at, Ex?

12:32.392 --> 12:34.358
Busy, just busy.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.261
You know, yup.
Nature's calling, one second.

12:37.263 --> 12:38.528
Come here, man.

12:38.530 --> 12:40.230
What are you, married man now?

12:40.232 --> 12:41.565
She got the cuffs on you now?

12:41.567 --> 12:44.435
No, not even close. How's
everything going with Sammy?

12:44.437 --> 12:46.503
How am I not supposed
to make you look like an asshole

12:46.505 --> 12:47.939
when you keep
switching around with girls?

12:47.941 --> 12:49.440
You're not supposed to not do anything.
Just don't worry about it.

12:49.442 --> 12:51.309
Rachel couldn't make it
so Sam's here.

12:51.311 --> 12:52.410
Rachel couldn't make it.
Scheduling conflict?

12:52.412 --> 12:54.545
Shh! Yeah, Exactly.
It doesn't matter where we are.

12:54.547 --> 12:57.281
This is all about being,
you know, outdoors.

12:57.283 --> 12:58.682
- Being men.
- Being men outdoors.

12:58.684 --> 12:59.585
It's not like, you know...

13:00.852 --> 13:03.688
I been fishing up here before
but it was a different spot.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.656
- This is supposed to be better.
- Uh-huh.

13:05.658 --> 13:06.523
- It's by a lake right?
- Yeah.

13:06.525 --> 13:09.259
Should of bought warmer boots.

13:09.261 --> 13:10.994
Whatever, man, I'm
hiking in sneakers.

13:10.996 --> 13:12.563
Yeah, I saw those,
those are very nice.

13:12.565 --> 13:14.031
So what are those, Italian?

13:14.033 --> 13:16.700
Did you buy the real ones or did you
get the fake ones on eBay again?

13:16.702 --> 13:18.469
Listen man, if you
wont put that camera away,

13:18.471 --> 13:20.036
I gotta look good for you.
Don't you think?

13:20.038 --> 13:23.241
You're gonna have a lot of fun
cleaning the mud off your shoes later.

13:23.243 --> 13:24.478
Aha! Snow!

13:25.678 --> 13:27.811
Whatever, man, don't pay
any attention to the snow.

13:27.813 --> 13:30.248
No, but its there,
though, you can't deny it.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.549
It's white and powdery.

13:31.551 --> 13:33.383
There is no snow.
I don't see any snow.

13:33.385 --> 13:36.420
It's not gonna snow. It's not gonna snow.
Stop talking about it.

13:36.422 --> 13:38.355
Stop giving it attention.
It's not going to snow.

13:38.357 --> 13:40.724
But it did.
The point is it did.

13:40.726 --> 13:42.325
- Already happened.
- I don't see any snow.

13:42.327 --> 13:43.261
Uh huh.

13:43.263 --> 13:45.329
- All right.
- Whatever.

13:45.331 --> 13:47.397
We're being one
with nature, right Ex?

13:47.399 --> 13:49.400
Absolutely, absolutely.

13:49.402 --> 13:50.667
With our Italian loafers.

13:50.669 --> 13:54.037
So Ex, you getting tired of the
whole Wall Street game yet?

13:54.039 --> 13:56.741
Burning other people's money,
etcetera.

13:56.743 --> 13:57.541
- I am.
- Hey, whatever.

13:57.543 --> 13:59.609
I'm a proud capitalist,
so sue me.

13:59.611 --> 14:01.746
But you better not, because
my lawyer will crush you.

14:01.748 --> 14:05.583
I have got the most
brilliant idea for a new show.

14:05.585 --> 14:06.884
What is it?

14:06.886 --> 14:11.354
One Brooks Brother suit, a
cigar, and a glass of brandy.

14:11.356 --> 14:13.526
Now that sounds like a show
I would love to watch.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.326
All right, here we are
at the campsite.

14:16.328 --> 14:19.430
As you can see,
my beautiful lady, Monica,

14:19.432 --> 14:21.632
has set up a lovely tent
right behind me.

14:21.634 --> 14:23.868
That's camera one, and if we
switch over to camera two,

14:23.870 --> 14:29.373
we can clearly see that they are
having a little bit of difficulty.

14:30.543 --> 14:32.642
I'm pretty sure he got it free

14:32.644 --> 14:34.311
with his shoes on eBay.

14:34.313 --> 14:36.847
Um, and clearly the winner
of the tenting contest

14:36.849 --> 14:39.717
is my beautiful lady,
Ms. Monica Tanner.

14:39.719 --> 14:42.320
Monica, baby,
smile for the camera.

14:42.322 --> 14:45.656
Dear, you know what?
I got it. I'm good.

14:45.658 --> 14:46.824
You're doing an amazing job.

14:46.826 --> 14:48.792
I don't need your help at all.
Thank you, nice.

14:48.794 --> 14:51.661
I love you. And I
also started the fire.

14:51.663 --> 14:54.598
Yeah, I think it needs
a little bit more wood there.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.367
Keeping us warm here.
Look at that churning gorgeous.

14:56.369 --> 14:57.801
How we doing over here guys?

14:57.803 --> 14:59.536
You're gonna pull it
out of that thing again.

14:59.538 --> 15:00.671
Can you slow down?

15:00.673 --> 15:02.906
Hi! We're doing fine.

15:02.908 --> 15:05.575
- Tent setup going okay?
- Yeah.

15:05.577 --> 15:07.911
This is the tent. This is
the tent she said she had.

15:07.913 --> 15:09.680
This is the tent when she
told me not to bring one

15:09.682 --> 15:10.781
th-that she had.

15:10.783 --> 15:13.483
Sam, was it his
prowess in the wilderness

15:13.485 --> 15:14.719
that attracted you
to him initially?

15:14.721 --> 15:16.554
Oh, it's all his charm.

15:16.556 --> 15:17.588
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy...

15:17.590 --> 15:18.955
It's all his charm.

15:18.957 --> 15:21.459
Go make your gay, little woodland
creature movie over there, okay?

15:21.461 --> 15:22.626
Can you do me a favor, please?

15:22.628 --> 15:23.828
I'm trying to shove
a stick into this

15:23.830 --> 15:25.695
because I'm missing a rod.

15:25.697 --> 15:29.367
All right, all right. Back
to-back to the lovely Monica.

15:29.369 --> 15:31.569
Thomas, Thomas, could
you please come help me

15:31.571 --> 15:33.536
with the sleeping bags
or just something?

15:33.538 --> 15:34.875
All right, all right, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.317
Where...

15:45.451 --> 15:46.684
Oh, man.

15:46.686 --> 15:47.685
Tommy.

15:47.687 --> 15:49.619
- Did you just...
- Hey, Tommy.

15:49.621 --> 15:50.923
Did you just see that?

15:52.859 --> 15:53.958
I just...
Did you just...

15:53.960 --> 15:54.892
Hey, what happened?

15:54.894 --> 15:56.326
Did you guys just...

15:56.328 --> 15:58.863
Dude, something just... Like a flash
of light and then it was gone.

15:58.865 --> 15:59.829
- Damnit!
- What was it?

15:59.831 --> 16:01.198
What did it look like?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.868
I-I don't know because someone
made me put my camera down.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.369
Oh, please.

16:05.371 --> 16:07.604
Don't tell me you been eating
mushrooms again like in Orlando, dude,

16:07.606 --> 16:08.973
'cause I can't
babysit you tonight.

16:08.975 --> 16:10.407
Dude, whatever.

16:10.409 --> 16:11.175
All right, whatever. Hey.

16:11.177 --> 16:12.977
Let's go back to the campfire.

16:12.979 --> 16:15.546
Hot dogs are ready,
beer is cold.

16:15.548 --> 16:16.647
Come on, we still
have stuff to set up.

16:16.649 --> 16:17.581
All right, I'll
leave my camera on later

16:17.583 --> 16:20.818
just in case, all right?
So, deal with it.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.185
Yeah. Hey, buddy,

16:22.187 --> 16:23.988
how come you never
told me about 'shrooms?

16:23.990 --> 16:25.890
I... What?

16:25.892 --> 16:27.824
All right, so what
are you scared of, again?

16:27.826 --> 16:30.026
The three S's.
Tell me the three S's.

16:30.028 --> 16:33.464
Man, sharks,
spiders and scorpions.

16:33.466 --> 16:35.031
I don't know why I would go
where any of them are.

16:35.033 --> 16:37.734
I know there can be some
spiders out here, but, uh...

16:37.736 --> 16:38.736
I think there are sharks
out here, actually.

16:38.738 --> 16:40.304
I don't think I'm gonna
see a shark out here.

16:40.306 --> 16:42.640
- I think you might.
- I don't think I'm a see a man-eating shark out here.

16:42.642 --> 16:44.675
The Long Island Sound,
you never know.

16:44.677 --> 16:46.977
You never know,
that's all I'm saying.

16:46.979 --> 16:48.778
How many beers have you had?

16:48.780 --> 16:51.714
Yeah, plenty.
Wait, is that rolling again?

16:51.716 --> 16:52.782
Yup.

16:52.784 --> 16:54.451
Come on, what is it with you
and that thing, man?

16:54.453 --> 16:56.686
I... You'll be great
to laugh at later.

16:56.688 --> 16:58.756
- Yeah, yeah.
- I gotta put my makeup on.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.690
Film yourself naked if
you want something to laugh at.

17:00.692 --> 17:02.026
Oh, you're a fire tonight,
buddy.

17:03.663 --> 17:04.594
Can I tell him?

17:04.596 --> 17:06.063
Come on. Please.

17:06.065 --> 17:09.799
You guys, Tommy is pitching
his own show.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.769
That's what this is all about.
This is for his reel.

17:12.771 --> 17:13.938
We're an Experiment right now.

17:13.940 --> 17:16.606
Oh, your own show.

17:16.608 --> 17:17.711
You're growing up.

17:18.778 --> 17:21.478
- Well, what's it about.
- You're looking for fame?

17:21.480 --> 17:22.813
No, its not even like that.

17:22.815 --> 17:25.519
Oh, its not even like that...
My ass, it's not.

17:26.018 --> 17:27.517
Hot shot.

17:27.519 --> 17:30.955
It is a reality show.

17:30.957 --> 17:33.090
One-man survival-type thing.

17:33.092 --> 17:36.494
But hasn't that sort of
been done before?

17:36.496 --> 17:37.694
Yes, but not like this.

17:37.696 --> 17:40.698
It'll be one host with a
single camera point of view.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.565
Yeah, and that's the tagline.

17:42.567 --> 17:43.834
One man one camera.

17:43.836 --> 17:46.536
Just kind of exactly like the
show you work on right now.

17:46.538 --> 17:47.805
It's not even made yet.
All right?

17:47.807 --> 17:48.805
It's an idea.

17:48.807 --> 17:50.040
I don't even know why
we are talking about it.

17:50.042 --> 17:52.709
I know why we're talking about it.
I mean, you know...

17:52.711 --> 17:54.711
Just... you know...

17:54.713 --> 17:56.980
Be nice for you to have success
somewhere along the way.

17:56.982 --> 17:58.047
You know what I mean?

17:58.049 --> 17:59.382
You are such an asshole.

17:59.384 --> 18:01.751
Just keep trying, keep trying,
keep trying, man, that's all.

18:01.753 --> 18:02.952
You are such an asshole.

18:02.954 --> 18:04.354
Why do you always have to rag
on what he's trying to do?

18:04.356 --> 18:05.488
Hey, hey, why do you always have
to rag on what I'm trying to do?

18:05.490 --> 18:08.659
I'm just playing around with him.
He's my best friend.

18:08.661 --> 18:09.893
You're not mad...

18:09.895 --> 18:11.562
See, he's not mad.

18:11.564 --> 18:12.763
He knows, ever since
I was a little kid,

18:12.765 --> 18:13.863
I would speak my mind.

18:13.865 --> 18:14.864
Yeah,
he doesn't give me a choice.

18:14.866 --> 18:16.667
Yeah, your mind is too big
for us to handle.

18:16.669 --> 18:18.869
Oh yeah, like some other things
I could mention.

18:18.871 --> 18:22.476
- Oh no, please don't.
- Whatever.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.808
Whatever!

18:25.810 --> 18:28.077
Well anyways, so,
I watched that show.

18:28.079 --> 18:30.914
That Kris adventure show,
you-you work on.

18:30.916 --> 18:31.849
Uh huh?

18:31.851 --> 18:33.017
Really gotta be honest, man,

18:33.019 --> 18:36.620
it's a little difficult
to-to get through.

18:36.622 --> 18:37.720
Yeah, well, that's the point.

18:37.722 --> 18:39.155
That's why it's flawed.

18:39.157 --> 18:40.824
That's why I told you I was working
on a completely different concept.

18:40.826 --> 18:42.025
You're not even listening to me.

18:42.027 --> 18:44.594
I'm listening. I'm
listening, different concept.

18:44.596 --> 18:49.132
Different concept, but what
I'm saying I guess, you know...

18:49.134 --> 18:51.634
You do not need that beer.

18:51.636 --> 18:53.003
You drink it.
You drink it.

18:53.005 --> 18:55.706
Just because-just because
you get a camera

18:55.708 --> 18:57.975
doesn't make you a filmmaker
all of a sudden, man.

18:57.977 --> 19:00.710
If that were the case,
I'd be Michael Bay right now.

19:00.712 --> 19:01.911
You know what I mean?
Just like...

19:01.913 --> 19:02.880
- You would be Michael Bay.
- I would.

19:02.882 --> 19:04.648
This is a megapixel phone camera

19:04.650 --> 19:06.683
and I'll be
like Brett freakin' Ratner.

19:06.685 --> 19:08.786
You know?
Steven freakin' Spielberg.

19:08.788 --> 19:10.187
- Wow, you're so supportive.
- George Luc-ass.

19:10.189 --> 19:11.788
Shut up!

19:11.790 --> 19:13.990
Amazing. Look at this kid.

19:13.992 --> 19:15.959
- This is your best friend.
- I'm playing around.

19:15.961 --> 19:17.827
I'm worried about
those spiders out here.

19:17.829 --> 19:19.633
What about scorpions?

19:20.633 --> 19:21.699
Eat sharks.

19:21.701 --> 19:23.933
I'm playing with you, man.
I'm playing with you.

19:23.935 --> 19:25.638
- He's just joking.
- Come on, sweetie.

19:30.009 --> 19:32.008
Turn it on. Is it on?

19:32.010 --> 19:32.942
- Turn it on. Is it on?
- Yeah. Go.

19:32.944 --> 19:34.847
It's on? Okay.

19:37.048 --> 19:38.815
Oh!

19:38.817 --> 19:39.816
Ex, dude!

19:39.818 --> 19:41.017
Do I still have my eyebrows?

19:41.019 --> 19:42.719
You're good.
You're good.

19:42.721 --> 19:44.153
I'm the king of this jungle!

19:44.155 --> 19:47.790
I have to put you on America's
Dumbest Imbecile Moron.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.759
Oh, you should do that,
do that, you should do that.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.629
Oh no,
get a close up of this baby.

19:51.631 --> 19:52.696
Oh, that's a great idea.

19:52.698 --> 19:54.864
This is that-this is that uh....

19:54.866 --> 19:56.100
Wait, wait, wait.

19:56.102 --> 19:58.201
Set it up for me.
What are we looking at?

20:00.071 --> 20:02.739
This is that 24-year malt.

20:02.741 --> 20:04.208
The premium $400 dollars a pop.

20:04.210 --> 20:05.875
- How much is it?
- $400 a pop.

20:05.877 --> 20:07.745
- How much?
- $400 a pop.

20:07.747 --> 20:10.113
Here we go again.

20:10.115 --> 20:12.716
It is! I got a whole case
of this sent to my office

20:12.718 --> 20:14.884
this week, uh, and
people collect these.

20:14.886 --> 20:16.920
- Congratulations.
- Stop showing off.

20:16.922 --> 20:19.989
Yeah, because I was involved
in some relatively lucrative

20:19.991 --> 20:21.792
and successful real estate deal

20:21.794 --> 20:24.795
and so they, uh,
sent to me as a reward.

20:24.797 --> 20:26.930
You are such a little liar.

20:26.932 --> 20:28.198
As a reward for
a successful real estate deal.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.234
You're such a little liar, Ex.

20:30.236 --> 20:32.135
Uh oh, elaborate, Sam.

20:32.137 --> 20:35.873
He's lying.
His father got him the booze.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.173
He sent it to him.

20:37.175 --> 20:40.009
So stop talking out of your ass.

20:40.011 --> 20:41.144
- What?
- A little gift from daddy?

20:41.146 --> 20:42.080
Yeah, a little gift from daddy.

20:42.082 --> 20:43.016
You don't know
what you're talking about.

20:44.416 --> 20:46.150
I heard you on
the phone last night.

20:46.152 --> 20:47.151
No.

20:47.153 --> 20:49.719
Your father sent you the booze.
Stop talking.

20:49.721 --> 20:53.824
You're a liar, and its snowing
so you're wrong on top of it, buddy.

20:53.826 --> 20:56.927
Busted!
What is that white stuff?

20:56.929 --> 20:58.161
You need to think
before you speak.

20:58.163 --> 20:59.462
Double whammy.

20:59.464 --> 21:01.731
You need to think
before you speak.

21:01.733 --> 21:03.901
- I'm just saying what I heard.
- All right, all right.

21:03.903 --> 21:05.235
You need to think
before you speak.

21:05.237 --> 21:06.903
Don't raise your voice at me.

21:06.905 --> 21:08.072
I'm not raising my voice at you,

21:08.074 --> 21:09.305
but if I wanna
raise my voice at you,

21:09.307 --> 21:10.274
I'll raise my voice at you.

21:10.276 --> 21:12.042
- Ex, Ex.
- You're an alcoholic, babe.

21:12.044 --> 21:14.277
- Oh Oh.
- Oh, I'm an alcoholic.

21:14.279 --> 21:16.479
Yeah, you can dish it out
but can't it in, huh?

21:16.481 --> 21:18.849
I'm an alcoholic that pays
your father's medical bills.

21:18.851 --> 21:21.117
- Oh, boy.
- Okay, Ex.

21:21.119 --> 21:22.286
What? No, tell 'em.

21:22.288 --> 21:23.319
Tommy.

21:23.321 --> 21:25.288
Tell 'em. Tell 'em.

21:25.290 --> 21:26.923
I pay
your father's medical bills

21:26.925 --> 21:28.792
because your broke,
fake modeling career

21:28.794 --> 21:30.960
doesn't make you enough money
to do it.

21:30.962 --> 21:31.929
Really, dude?

21:31.931 --> 21:33.831
- Sammy..
- Sam...

21:33.833 --> 21:36.767
What? Yeah, storm
off, storm off.

21:36.769 --> 21:38.501
Ex, give me this. Give me this

21:38.503 --> 21:39.969
Storm off, storm off.

21:50.816 --> 21:54.884
Dude, you did
it to yourself, man.

21:54.886 --> 21:59.291
Turn that off, dude.
I said turn it off!

22:03.863 --> 22:05.362
She know's you
didn't mean it, all right.

22:05.364 --> 22:09.099
You just gotta talk to her.
Talk to her, okay?

22:09.101 --> 22:10.366
I just keep blowing
it with her, man.

22:10.368 --> 22:11.735
I know, I know.
Listen, you gotta...

22:11.737 --> 22:15.538
You know, I didn't mean what
I said back at the rest stop.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.841
You know, I was trying
to brush it off.

22:17.843 --> 22:18.909
But I think
she like me too, man.

22:18.911 --> 22:20.143
She's such a great girl.

22:20.145 --> 22:21.077
She wouldn't be putting
up with all your bullshit

22:21.079 --> 22:22.313
if she didn't.

22:22.315 --> 22:24.718
I know I been putting up with
your bullshit my entire life.

22:25.151 --> 22:26.850
All right, look, you can't-

22:26.852 --> 22:29.987
you can't say shit like that
to her in front of people.

22:29.989 --> 22:33.990
What would you do, huh?

22:33.992 --> 22:35.359
I would probably
do the same thing.

22:35.361 --> 22:38.261
The same thing. Exactly.
Exactly, right?

22:38.263 --> 22:40.564
- Sorry, man.
- It's all right.

22:40.566 --> 22:41.632
- I'm sorry, man.
- It's okay. It happens. Yeah?

22:41.634 --> 22:44.133
- I wanna go to bed, man.
- Good idea.

22:44.135 --> 22:45.939
Take care of Sam, yeah?

22:47.306 --> 22:49.742
- Oh, Tommy...
- Yeah?

22:50.942 --> 22:52.875
You were right about the snow.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.947
- I love you man.
- I love you, too.

22:56.949 --> 23:00.754
All right, go pass out.
Go pass out.

23:01.220 --> 23:03.386
Tell Monica, you know...

23:03.388 --> 23:05.855
...that I love her, dude.

23:05.857 --> 23:07.857
She knows, she knows.

23:07.859 --> 23:09.194
All right, man.

23:15.201 --> 23:16.432
Were you filming
the whole time?

23:16.434 --> 23:18.334
Yup. I sure was.

23:18.336 --> 23:19.836
You are out of control.

23:19.838 --> 23:21.371
- I'm the filmmaker, now, mister.
- Not cool, not cool.

23:21.373 --> 23:22.840
I love you, man.

23:22.842 --> 23:24.440
So, it's, uh, one am

23:24.442 --> 23:26.442
on this beautiful
snow-filled morning

23:26.444 --> 23:28.444
and we're witnessing
another super-battle

23:28.446 --> 23:30.213
between Ex and Sammy.

23:30.215 --> 23:32.315
I think they're going
for a record.

23:32.317 --> 23:34.317
Most fights possible

23:34.319 --> 23:37.353
in a 24-hour period
by two human beings.

23:38.891 --> 23:40.324
I can't believe we're snowed in.

23:40.326 --> 23:41.991
I know, it's nice, though.

23:41.993 --> 23:43.392
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.

23:43.394 --> 23:44.260
No service up here.

23:44.262 --> 23:46.129
Ugh, put that thing away,
will you?

23:46.131 --> 23:47.934
That's why we came out here,
to get rid of it.

23:48.867 --> 23:50.901
Oh my god,
what's wrong with them?

23:50.903 --> 23:52.201
This is pretty normal.

23:52.203 --> 23:54.403
They need counseling
and we need some sleep.

23:54.405 --> 23:55.905
Who needs sleep?

23:56.875 --> 23:59.142
Isn't-isn't that enough filming
for one day?

23:59.144 --> 24:00.477
- No.
- Could we just be done with the camera?

24:00.479 --> 24:02.011
No, I might-
I might miss something.

24:02.013 --> 24:03.145
I have to film every moment.

24:03.147 --> 24:04.413
What are you possibly
gonna miss?

24:04.415 --> 24:06.149
'Cause you know what happens?
The best things always happen

24:06.151 --> 24:07.950
and then I'm not filming.

24:07.952 --> 24:08.684
Either that,
or I don't write it down.

24:08.686 --> 24:10.053
- It's one of two things.
- Okay.

24:10.055 --> 24:12.122
And I either forget it... This
way, if I'm filming everything,

24:12.124 --> 24:13.090
then there's nothing
I'm going to miss.

24:13.092 --> 24:15.359
You saw that jackass
spitting on that fire.

24:15.361 --> 24:18.929
We never want to miss that.

24:22.101 --> 24:23.336
Oh god, what now?

24:25.136 --> 24:27.136
Oh, you're going outside?
You're going outside?

24:27.138 --> 24:28.138
You're going outside the tent?

24:28.140 --> 24:30.140
You're going outside.
You're going outside.

24:30.142 --> 24:31.275
- Leave me the hell alone.
- I need your-

24:31.277 --> 24:33.009
I need your body heat in here,

24:33.011 --> 24:33.944
you know that's how this works.

24:33.946 --> 24:36.113
Otherwise you'll be cold
and I'll be cold,

24:36.115 --> 24:37.081
that's two people
that'll be cold.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.915
I swear to god,
if you don't leave me alone,

24:38.917 --> 24:41.017
I'm walking to the car.
Leave me alone right now.

24:41.019 --> 24:41.852
You're gonna sleep in the snow?

24:41.854 --> 24:43.386
Yeah, I'm gonna sleep
in the snow.

24:43.388 --> 24:44.488
You're gonna sleep in the snow.

24:44.490 --> 24:47.257
You know what? Fine.
Freeze out here.

24:47.259 --> 24:49.258
See if I give a shit.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.960
Unbelievable.

24:50.962 --> 24:52.965
I'm so tired of this bullshit.

24:55.334 --> 24:57.133
That looks like its over.

24:57.135 --> 24:58.267
Yeah, should I go talk to her?

24:58.269 --> 24:59.969
No, just let her be.

24:59.971 --> 25:01.270
- You sure?
- Check on her tomorrow.

25:01.272 --> 25:02.942
Okay.

25:04.076 --> 25:07.012
The constant steady
stream of bullshit.

25:14.286 --> 25:16.288
- That's nice.
- Yeah, I know.

25:17.021 --> 25:18.191
Hey.

25:40.179 --> 25:41.143
What?

25:41.145 --> 25:42.315
Camera off.

25:43.115 --> 25:44.951
- Fine.
- Yeah.

25:55.027 --> 25:56.026
Monica, wake up.

25:56.028 --> 25:58.061
- What is that?
- I don't know.

25:58.063 --> 25:59.129
Tommy, what is that?

26:06.305 --> 26:07.974
Is that Sam?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.038
Sam!

26:09.040 --> 26:11.007
- Stay quiet.
- Sam!

26:11.009 --> 26:12.275
- Tommy!
- Sam!

26:12.277 --> 26:14.411
- Tommy!
- Stay back.

26:14.413 --> 26:16.179
Sam! Baby?!

26:18.616 --> 26:20.584
Tommy, what's happening?

26:20.586 --> 26:22.084
Tommy?!

26:22.086 --> 26:23.286
Sam? Sam!

26:25.490 --> 26:27.123
Sam!

26:33.398 --> 26:35.032
- Is she okay?
- It's okay.

26:35.034 --> 26:37.366
Sam baby, please wake up.

26:37.368 --> 26:39.237
What is that, Tommy?

26:39.570 --> 26:40.903
What is that, man?

26:40.905 --> 26:42.506
- Yes, what is that light?
- Do you hear that?

26:42.508 --> 26:44.110
- Sam.
- It's still here.

26:44.576 --> 26:46.075
Sam?

26:46.077 --> 26:47.076
Sammy?

26:47.078 --> 26:49.112
Sam.

26:51.517 --> 26:53.249
You guys, come back over here.

26:53.251 --> 26:55.084
- I gotta get this.
- Can you hear me?

26:55.086 --> 26:56.519
Whoa, we'll be right back,
all right?

26:56.521 --> 26:58.354
We'll be right back.

26:58.356 --> 26:59.523
- Just stay put.
- Tommy!

26:59.525 --> 27:01.290
Are you sure you don't
want to stay with Sam?

27:01.292 --> 27:02.359
No man, I gotta see this.

27:03.561 --> 27:06.095
Did you see that?
It was huge.

27:06.097 --> 27:08.097
You see where it...
This way, this way!

27:08.099 --> 27:10.535
Come this way.
Come on.

27:11.537 --> 27:13.202
Come on, come on,
come on, get up.

27:13.204 --> 27:15.337
- Wait up!
- Come on.

27:15.339 --> 27:17.542
- Where did it go?
- I can't tell.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.215
What is that?

27:24.083 --> 27:25.284
- What is that?
- Go, go!

27:27.118 --> 27:29.119
Ex, wait.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.293
<i>There is no escape...</i>

27:35.094 --> 27:37.029
<i>There is no escape...</i>

27:38.196 --> 27:39.863
Hello?

27:39.865 --> 27:41.131
<i>There is no escape...</i>

27:41.133 --> 27:42.035
Uh...

27:43.102 --> 27:44.668
- Who are you boys?
- I don't know what it was!

27:44.670 --> 27:46.603
It flew right over the road!

27:46.605 --> 27:48.104
Where you boys staying?

27:48.106 --> 27:49.238
What's up with your radio, man?

27:49.240 --> 27:50.640
I don't know.
I'm going to find out

27:50.642 --> 27:53.110
and we're gonna get help.
All right? Calm down.

27:53.112 --> 27:54.544
Come on, we gotta go, man!
We gotta see this thing!

27:54.546 --> 27:55.511
This is close
to what this is.

27:55.513 --> 27:56.447
Let's see what this is.

27:57.449 --> 27:58.280
Hey, hey, hold on!

27:58.282 --> 27:59.716
Come on, lets go check it out.

27:59.718 --> 28:01.485
You stay here with the truck.

28:01.487 --> 28:02.585
Be careful, man! Be careful!

28:02.587 --> 28:03.455
Looks like it's that way.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.225
Hey, hey, slow down, I said.
Stay back, behind me.

28:08.227 --> 28:10.463
Radio is completely dead.
Damn it.

28:11.730 --> 28:14.264
I was driving along
and it flew right over me.

28:14.266 --> 28:15.465
Where the hell did it go?

28:15.467 --> 28:17.467
It went down. It had to.

28:17.469 --> 28:19.236
It's on the ground?

28:19.238 --> 28:20.403
I don't think
we should go up there.

28:20.405 --> 28:23.305
My uncle told me about craft
that landed here years ago.

28:23.307 --> 28:25.307
Everyone around here
knows what I'm talking about.

28:25.309 --> 28:27.209
Phil, Phil shut up!

28:27.211 --> 28:28.277
A lot of illness. A
lot of unexplained deaths.

28:28.279 --> 28:29.446
It's close.

28:33.519 --> 28:35.485
- I feel strange.
- Me too.

28:35.487 --> 28:37.520
Do you feel that, Tommy?
Hear that?

28:37.522 --> 28:39.523
What is that?

28:44.363 --> 28:45.495
Oh my god.

28:48.767 --> 28:50.699
Oh, man, whoa.
What is that?

28:53.571 --> 28:55.404
There is no escape...

28:55.406 --> 28:56.573
Do you see that?
Guys, look!

29:02.513 --> 29:03.313
Oh my god.

29:10.221 --> 29:11.220
What the hell?

29:11.222 --> 29:12.288
What was...
Tommy...

29:12.290 --> 29:13.456
What's going on, man?

29:16.228 --> 29:17.794
Oh my god. Ex, oh my god.

29:17.796 --> 29:21.430
Tommy! Tommy!
What's going on, dude?

29:21.432 --> 29:22.665
Keep your guards up.

29:29.407 --> 29:30.575
You guys hear that?

29:34.546 --> 29:36.712
Oh, my god! Oh, oh!

30:06.811 --> 30:08.180
Ex!

30:08.713 --> 30:09.714
Ex!

30:11.482 --> 30:12.617
Ex!

31:25.790 --> 31:29.892
Sam, Sam, Sam?

31:29.894 --> 31:31.463
Sam.

31:32.663 --> 31:33.798
Sam?

31:34.732 --> 31:37.499
- Tommy!
- Sam. Monica.

31:39.704 --> 31:42.471
Are you okay?
Why did you leave me?

31:42.473 --> 31:44.106
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:44.108 --> 31:45.542
I'm sorry.

31:45.544 --> 31:47.911
Tell me what happened.
Where's Ex?

31:51.516 --> 31:52.382
Sam.

31:52.384 --> 31:53.749
How long has she been like this?

31:53.751 --> 31:55.387
Since you left.

31:57.622 --> 32:01.757
She was mumbling at first
and she got quiet

32:01.759 --> 32:03.496
and now she
doesn't say anything.

32:04.695 --> 32:06.662
There's more.

32:06.664 --> 32:08.500
What?

32:09.934 --> 32:12.538
She has these marks.

32:13.538 --> 32:16.909
They're all-
they're all over her skin.

32:19.411 --> 32:20.576
I mean, look.

32:23.147 --> 32:25.417
She has them on her chest.

32:30.521 --> 32:32.724
Tommy, why aren't you
telling me what happened?

32:33.625 --> 32:35.528
What did you see out there?

32:36.661 --> 32:37.994
Please tell me!

32:37.996 --> 32:39.432
I have to show
you what I filmed.

32:46.471 --> 32:47.670
Why are you still filming?

32:47.672 --> 32:49.005
We gotta get to the car.

32:49.007 --> 32:50.907
We gotta start moving.

32:50.909 --> 32:52.441
What about Ex?

32:52.443 --> 32:53.878
Grab me my vest.

32:54.679 --> 32:55.678
Get your phone.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.583
- Tommy, what about Ex?
- I don't know.

32:58.517 --> 33:01.851
I think Ex is gone.
Check your phone.

33:01.853 --> 33:03.920
We have no service here.
I already told you that.

33:03.922 --> 33:05.055
I want you to make sure.

33:05.057 --> 33:08.458
Stop it, Tommy. Stop asking
me shit for no reason.

33:08.460 --> 33:09.492
We need to figure something out.

33:09.494 --> 33:11.460
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

33:11.462 --> 33:12.530
I'm sorry.

33:14.633 --> 33:17.866
We gotta get back to the car.
We-we-we gotta find the trail.

33:17.868 --> 33:20.505
We get back to the rest area
and get some help, okay?

33:22.874 --> 33:23.909
Okay?

33:25.609 --> 33:26.678
Sam?

33:30.915 --> 33:31.849
Sam?

33:31.851 --> 33:33.786
- Sam!
- Where did she go?

33:34.653 --> 33:35.884
Sam!

33:35.886 --> 33:37.490
Sammy!

33:37.955 --> 33:39.791
Sam, can you hear me?

33:40.791 --> 33:42.057
You were looking right at her.

33:42.059 --> 33:42.926
You telling me you didn't see
what direction she went in?

33:42.928 --> 33:43.793
I wasn't looking right at her.

33:43.795 --> 33:46.796
You had me check my phone,
remember?

33:46.798 --> 33:47.796
Sam!

33:47.798 --> 33:48.898
I can't see anything
out here.

33:48.900 --> 33:49.731
Sammy!

33:49.733 --> 33:51.867
Tommy, how did this happen?

33:51.869 --> 33:53.236
You were right there,
you were filming.

33:53.238 --> 33:54.536
How did you not see her?

33:54.538 --> 33:55.572
Calm, calm down.

33:55.574 --> 33:56.873
I just can't calm down.
She's out here.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.641
Tommy,
she's out here by herself.

33:58.643 --> 34:00.413
- Sammy!
- Sam!

34:02.079 --> 34:03.546
What is that?

34:06.750 --> 34:07.950
I can't tell where it is.

34:11.722 --> 34:13.826
We should go back to the camp.

34:15.494 --> 34:16.594
What about Sam?

34:17.527 --> 34:18.931
We just can't leaver her here.

34:19.697 --> 34:20.795
Tommy.

34:30.842 --> 34:32.007
Be absolutely still.

34:50.661 --> 34:52.831
Come on.
Get up, get up.

35:05.577 --> 35:07.677
Faster, faster.

35:07.679 --> 35:09.012
I'm trying.

35:10.748 --> 35:11.780
Come on, get up.

35:19.590 --> 35:20.759
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

35:21.326 --> 35:23.896
Yeah. We'll walk slowly.

35:24.896 --> 35:25.961
Are you sure
we should keep going?

35:25.963 --> 35:27.664
We have to.

35:27.666 --> 35:28.901
It's the only path.

35:32.903 --> 35:33.938
Tommy, I'm scared.

35:34.873 --> 35:37.606
Just be careful. Stay quiet.

35:37.608 --> 35:38.844
Okay.

35:43.148 --> 35:44.914
- Oh my god, it's Sam.
- What?

35:44.916 --> 35:46.051
It's Sam.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.122
What is she doing?

35:52.356 --> 35:53.958
Tommy, she's just sitting there.

36:05.836 --> 36:07.604
Tommy, what's happening to her?

36:07.606 --> 36:08.737
Sam!

36:11.809 --> 36:12.978
Go!

36:22.987 --> 36:24.956
Shh.

36:30.829 --> 36:32.729
Did you see her?

36:32.731 --> 36:33.963
Shh.

36:33.965 --> 36:35.701
Did you see her, Tommy?

36:36.067 --> 36:37.168
Stay close to me.

36:38.003 --> 36:40.005
I don't think
I can do this.

36:43.675 --> 36:46.108
We have to go back. We missed the turn.
We have to go back.

36:46.110 --> 36:48.110
No, we didn't miss any turns.
We didn't miss any turns.

36:48.112 --> 36:50.982
Please, baby, It's just a few
minutes back, I'm telling you.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.083
Ugh, this is useless, come on.

36:54.085 --> 36:55.721
Help me light the map.

37:12.070 --> 37:13.135
What is that?

37:13.137 --> 37:15.838
- Stay close to me. Run!
- Tommy!

37:15.840 --> 37:17.139
- Monica!
- Tommy!

37:17.141 --> 37:19.008
- Keep going!
- Tommy, wait!

37:19.010 --> 37:21.943
- Don't stop!
- Tommy!

37:23.114 --> 37:24.847
Tommy!

37:29.253 --> 37:30.788
Tommy.

37:34.726 --> 37:36.028
Tommy!

37:56.847 --> 37:58.081
Tommy!

37:58.083 --> 37:59.851
Shh.

38:23.208 --> 38:24.710
Shit.

38:27.811 --> 38:29.080
You think we missed the turn?

38:30.748 --> 38:31.783
No.

38:33.751 --> 38:34.853
We should keep going.

38:36.253 --> 38:37.989
I'm so tired.

38:44.195 --> 38:45.698
Babe...

39:02.914 --> 39:05.317
We gotta get out of here.
There's gotta be a way out.

39:06.985 --> 39:08.854
God, this looks familiar.

39:10.320 --> 39:14.326
That rest stop,
it can't be far from this.

39:17.128 --> 39:20.865
We keep heading east. I don't see how
we can't still be at the same spot.

39:26.237 --> 39:27.271
Tommy.

39:28.172 --> 39:31.374
Tommy,
can we just sit for a second?

39:31.376 --> 39:32.974
- Please?
- You okay?

39:32.976 --> 39:35.047
- Yeah.
- Sit.

39:38.182 --> 39:40.950
I'm a get us out of here, okay?

39:42.820 --> 39:46.023
- I'm so scared.
- I know, I know.

39:47.025 --> 39:49.391
I feel like we just
keep going in circles.

39:49.393 --> 39:52.894
I know Exactly where we are. We just
have to keep heading southeast.

39:52.896 --> 39:55.900
And we're going to find a town
or a road or something, okay?

39:56.835 --> 39:58.302
Okay.

40:01.039 --> 40:02.374
Did you see it?

40:04.041 --> 40:05.273
Yeah.

40:05.275 --> 40:06.811
Sam.

40:07.311 --> 40:08.577
I can't get that out of my head.

40:08.579 --> 40:11.179
I know, but you can't think
about that right now, okay?

40:11.181 --> 40:13.316
- It could have been one of us.
- I know, I know.

40:13.318 --> 40:16.789
But you can't think about that right now.
All right?

40:17.222 --> 40:19.287
We just have to get out of here.

40:19.289 --> 40:22.291
- Okay. Lets focus on that, okay?
- Okay.

40:22.293 --> 40:23.959
Let's focus on getting safe

40:23.961 --> 40:25.197
and get out of here okay.

40:26.063 --> 40:27.298
Why are you still filming?

40:28.833 --> 40:31.333
It's the only evidence that we have
that something happened here tonight.

40:31.335 --> 40:33.905
I gotta keep filming, okay?
I gotta.

40:36.206 --> 40:38.109
Tommy.

40:39.110 --> 40:40.813
Yeah?

40:41.411 --> 40:44.048
Promise me we'll
make it through this.

41:05.369 --> 41:07.138
I don't think
it's ever gonna stop.

41:25.923 --> 41:26.856
I don't know where
it's coming from.

41:26.858 --> 41:28.057
Tommy, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

41:28.059 --> 41:30.258
- No no, don't move.
- Come on. It's not safe here.

41:30.260 --> 41:31.360
Tommy!

41:31.362 --> 41:33.329
It's coming from over here.

41:33.331 --> 41:34.930
- Tommy, let's go.
- Monica!

41:34.932 --> 41:36.264
We can't be here.

41:37.501 --> 41:39.001
Tommy.

41:40.038 --> 41:42.137
Monica!

41:42.139 --> 41:44.206
Over here!

41:44.208 --> 41:45.508
Monica!

42:07.731 --> 42:09.268
Monica!

42:12.436 --> 42:14.139
Monica!

42:19.409 --> 42:20.575
Monica.

42:26.751 --> 42:28.320
I can't go back.

42:33.023 --> 42:35.927
I can't go back.
I can't go back.

42:36.494 --> 42:39.463
I can't go back.
I can't go back.

42:40.431 --> 42:42.333
I can't go back.

42:43.467 --> 42:44.936
Baby.

42:46.403 --> 42:48.340
I can't go back.

42:50.108 --> 42:52.210
I can't go back.
I can't go...

43:11.561 --> 43:13.164
I don't know what to do.

44:02.213 --> 44:03.378
Ex?

44:04.481 --> 44:05.648
Ex.

44:05.650 --> 44:07.682
Oh... Oh, Tommy.

44:07.684 --> 44:09.453
Ex, thank god.

44:15.293 --> 44:16.492
I filmed this, man.

44:16.494 --> 44:20.162
No! No! Help me!

44:20.164 --> 44:23.566
Help me! Please, god!

44:23.568 --> 44:25.601
No! Ah, no!

44:25.603 --> 44:27.139
I don't know..

44:28.172 --> 44:30.673
I think there's some kind of,
like, shield.

44:30.675 --> 44:31.541
Shield?

44:31.543 --> 44:35.276
Like a force or something,
'cause...

44:35.278 --> 44:38.246
...I was walking, must have
been four miles north of here

44:38.248 --> 44:41.383
and all of a sudden,
I was back on the trail

44:41.385 --> 44:43.119
next to you.

44:43.121 --> 44:44.586
It doesn't make any sense.

44:46.690 --> 44:48.292
It's impossible.

44:50.894 --> 44:52.364
I thought I lost you, man.

44:54.364 --> 44:56.067
I thought I lost you too, man.

44:57.635 --> 44:59.271
It's so cold.

45:02.639 --> 45:04.342
We were heading south.

45:06.476 --> 45:07.645
I got separated.

45:12.516 --> 45:13.585
Sam?

45:21.391 --> 45:23.127
Sorry, man.

45:25.362 --> 45:26.364
Sorry.

45:35.239 --> 45:36.374
We're trapped.

45:39.376 --> 45:40.612
It's looking for us.

45:42.679 --> 45:44.582
Monica.

45:45.416 --> 45:47.249
Oh my god, I gotta find Monica.

45:47.251 --> 45:48.383
- We got separated. We...
- Tommy.

45:48.385 --> 45:50.385
- The thing came at us..
- You gotta forget about Monica.

45:50.387 --> 45:52.253
- You gotta forget about her.
- I can't forget about her!

45:52.255 --> 45:53.524
I'm not you!

45:56.494 --> 45:57.596
Right. Just...

46:05.603 --> 46:07.338
What are we gonna do?

46:09.472 --> 46:10.741
I can't believe this.

46:14.478 --> 46:16.248
I-I saw another ship, man.

46:18.416 --> 46:20.352
This disk high in the sky.

46:24.422 --> 46:26.490
I don't know
what these things are.

46:27.458 --> 46:28.460
Ex.

46:31.295 --> 46:32.293
What?

46:32.295 --> 46:33.297
You see that?

46:45.275 --> 46:46.377
It's a house.

46:47.577 --> 46:49.313
Maybe there's a landline.

46:53.583 --> 46:55.286
Right behind you.

46:56.353 --> 46:58.189
It looks abandoned.

48:00.684 --> 48:02.353
I'm going to check upstairs.

48:02.820 --> 48:04.422
Okay.

48:05.623 --> 48:06.691
Be careful.

51:11.541 --> 51:12.777
Hey, Tommy!

51:13.878 --> 51:16.979
Dude, look what I found.
It's loaded.

51:16.981 --> 51:18.650
What is that smell?

51:26.556 --> 51:27.759
Holy shit.

51:30.661 --> 51:32.864
It says here he found it
back in May.

51:33.931 --> 51:36.697
There was a storm
in the evening and...

51:36.699 --> 51:39.471
...a loud crash
and then the Earth shook.

51:40.871 --> 51:43.474
He went to investigate
and found it.

51:45.009 --> 51:46.744
It was still alive
when he found it.

51:47.945 --> 51:49.581
He brought it back here.

51:51.882 --> 51:54.615
It's all these theories here,
like...

51:54.617 --> 51:56.784
...an alien base,

51:56.786 --> 51:58.755
government conspiracy.

52:01.559 --> 52:03.661
This guy
must have been obsessed.

52:04.628 --> 52:07.028
Whoever discovered this
did an autopsy.

52:07.030 --> 52:08.500
What is his name?

52:09.567 --> 52:11.733
Dr. Charles Roy.

52:11.735 --> 52:12.903
It must be him.

52:17.708 --> 52:18.974
That corpse...

52:18.976 --> 52:20.275
Yeah?

52:20.277 --> 52:24.648
It's-it's much smaller than the
thing that attacked us, right?

52:25.715 --> 52:29.851
Like it's a...
completely different species.

52:29.853 --> 52:30.952
There is another one.

52:30.954 --> 52:33.525
I saw a smaller one
near the crash site, remember?

52:42.099 --> 52:43.865
I see they wrote an
article about him here.

52:43.867 --> 52:44.932
What does it say?

52:44.934 --> 52:46.938
Says he's a medical researcher.

52:47.938 --> 52:49.807
Why wouldn't he report
any of this?

52:51.708 --> 52:53.544
I Guess he thought no one
would believe him.

53:04.755 --> 53:06.557
Charles Roy.

53:09.827 --> 53:11.193
"Day three.

53:11.195 --> 53:14.095
The visitor
seems to be recovering.

53:14.097 --> 53:18.867
He is not eating the food
I have provided for him.

53:18.869 --> 53:21.105
However, he drank
the boiled water."

53:23.773 --> 53:24.808
Look at this.

53:26.242 --> 53:29.677
It's May 20th.

53:29.679 --> 53:32.713
The visitor is...

53:32.715 --> 53:35.152
...not talking to me verbally.

53:36.719 --> 53:38.787
But...

53:38.789 --> 53:41.923
...I'm able
to fully understand him.

53:41.925 --> 53:44.062
Or it, rather, I...

53:44.994 --> 53:47.795
I'm not sure of its gender.

53:47.797 --> 53:52.703
The visitor is behaving...
erratically.

53:53.704 --> 53:57.673
It's uh, its still weak...

53:57.675 --> 53:59.141
...but...

53:59.143 --> 54:01.443
...it's sending mixed signals.

54:01.445 --> 54:03.815
I think it's trying
to deceive me.

54:04.748 --> 54:07.784
The visitor does not
want to be filmed.

54:17.927 --> 54:19.196
It's dying.

54:20.264 --> 54:23.898
I think I am...

54:23.900 --> 54:27.170
...able to figure out
its intentions.

54:28.005 --> 54:30.775
They're not here to befriend us.

54:31.909 --> 54:33.175
No shit, Charles.

54:35.746 --> 54:36.948
Oh.

54:37.481 --> 54:38.983
Oh, man.

54:44.221 --> 54:45.789
Oh!

54:56.199 --> 54:57.668
Ugh.

55:04.974 --> 55:10.947
The body cavity is filled
with a strange dark liquid.

55:12.014 --> 55:13.081
It's not hemoglobin

55:13.083 --> 55:16.954
its more like hemocyanin.
It's, like, so viscous.

55:18.322 --> 55:21.925
I can't even...
wash it off my skin.

55:23.159 --> 55:25.894
I placed the body
in the refrigerator

55:25.896 --> 55:27.699
for preservation.

55:28.965 --> 55:30.300
I'm not feeling well.

55:31.300 --> 55:33.769
I'm unable to move freely.

55:33.771 --> 55:35.807
I have insomnia.

55:36.806 --> 55:42.911
These are like...
strange-pigmented...

55:42.913 --> 55:46.046
...or what.

55:46.048 --> 55:48.251
...Lesions. Now, no...

55:49.219 --> 55:51.088
...on my arms...

55:51.954 --> 55:53.854
Can't even...

55:53.856 --> 55:57.258
...walk up a hundred feet
away from the house.

55:57.260 --> 55:59.262
I always end up here.

55:59.996 --> 56:00.996
Is that it?

56:00.998 --> 56:02.266
That's the last video entry.

56:04.034 --> 56:05.269
Okay...

56:05.936 --> 56:07.038
All right.

56:09.940 --> 56:11.108
What do you think this means?

56:12.208 --> 56:13.744
I mean, what is this?

56:14.577 --> 56:16.346
Like, an invasion?

56:19.016 --> 56:21.148
Wouldn't they go for the
populated areas first, you know,

56:21.150 --> 56:22.953
take over the cities?

56:23.954 --> 56:27.289
I mean... maybe
they're, uh...

56:27.291 --> 56:30.294
...still examining us,
collecting data.

56:34.164 --> 56:36.298
What are we gonna do?

56:36.300 --> 56:37.166
We have to do something.

56:37.168 --> 56:39.202
We can't just let them
do this to us.

56:40.403 --> 56:42.373
- We just can't sit here, Tommy!
- Shh, quiet down.

58:10.226 --> 58:11.194
Charles.

58:12.329 --> 58:14.065
Charles, is that you?

58:16.132 --> 58:17.367
Tommy, don't get
too close to him.

58:23.239 --> 58:26.877
Charles... I'm Tommy.

58:28.177 --> 58:30.447
This is Ex, we're from the city.

58:33.382 --> 58:35.550
- Something's really wrong with him, man.
- Shh.

58:35.552 --> 58:38.256
We found your work here.
Charles?

58:39.422 --> 58:40.891
Charles, what...

58:44.161 --> 58:46.898
Ex, what's wrong with him?

58:49.532 --> 58:51.032
Charles?

58:51.034 --> 58:54.971
I need you to talk to me. I need you
to tell me what's happening here.

58:55.438 --> 58:57.173
We've seen...

59:03.179 --> 59:05.280
Tommy, this is a
waste of time, man.

59:05.282 --> 59:07.385
He's sick, look at him.

59:10.286 --> 59:13.021
Have you seen them, yet?

59:13.023 --> 59:15.322
We've seen a lot of
things we can't understand.

59:15.324 --> 59:18.094
I have been listening.

59:19.128 --> 59:20.931
Listening...

59:21.498 --> 59:22.363
Listening.

59:22.365 --> 59:24.331
All right, listening to what?

59:27.336 --> 59:29.273
Why didn't you report this, man?

59:30.239 --> 59:31.505
Why didn't you report
this to someone?

59:31.507 --> 59:33.276
Ex, relax.

59:36.380 --> 59:40.382
They won't let you...

59:40.384 --> 59:42.182
He's cracking up, man.

59:42.184 --> 59:44.052
Oh... oh...

59:44.054 --> 59:45.420
Something's really wrong
with him, man.

59:45.422 --> 59:48.055
Charles, Charles, are you...

59:48.057 --> 59:50.325
Oh! Oh!

59:53.362 --> 59:57.465
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, man.
Oh, man.

59:57.467 --> 59:59.135
Is that...

01:00:19.188 --> 01:00:20.991
What is that, Charles?
What are you doing?

01:00:22.159 --> 01:00:23.427
What the hell?

01:00:43.413 --> 01:00:46.150
This helps me.

01:01:12.108 --> 01:01:15.246
We can... lock him
down there, you know.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.579
I don't want him to hear us.

01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:20.183
No man, I don't know.

01:01:25.489 --> 01:01:31.693
Just... keep your distance...
all right?

01:01:31.695 --> 01:01:33.564
Tommy, what are we going to do?

01:01:35.264 --> 01:01:36.599
I don't know.

01:01:47.344 --> 01:01:49.280
- Charles?
- Charles?

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:53.548
Careful, Tom.

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:55.086
Charles?

01:02:03.693 --> 01:02:05.229
Careful.

01:02:07.764 --> 01:02:09.300
Charles?

01:02:13.436 --> 01:02:14.434
Whoa.

01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:15.369
I don't know, man.

01:02:18.407 --> 01:02:20.577
- Charles?
- Charles? Whoa.

01:02:23.612 --> 01:02:25.412
Charles, what are you doing?

01:02:25.414 --> 01:02:27.514
- Charles, why are you...
- Charles?

01:02:27.516 --> 01:02:30.251
Charles? Charles?

01:02:30.253 --> 01:02:31.485
Charles?!

01:02:31.487 --> 01:02:33.253
- Put the hook down, Charles.
- Charles, wait!

01:02:33.255 --> 01:02:34.488
- Charles?!
- Charles!

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:35.490
Stop!

01:02:35.492 --> 01:02:36.657
- Tommy, get out of there!
- Shit!

01:02:43.233 --> 01:02:46.534
Oh my god.

01:02:46.536 --> 01:02:49.472
Oh my god.

01:02:51.574 --> 01:02:53.277
Ex...

01:03:07.556 --> 01:03:10.358
Oh my god.
We gotta go now!

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.561
Now! Go!

01:03:13.563 --> 01:03:15.432
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:03:20.503 --> 01:03:21.568
Ex!

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.673
Ex!

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:52.733
We gotta do something.

01:03:52.735 --> 01:03:55.403
All right.
On the count of three,

01:03:55.405 --> 01:03:56.537
- let go of the door.
- Okay!

01:03:56.539 --> 01:03:57.738
Okay? Okay.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:03.778
One... two... three...

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.479
Three!

01:04:20.664 --> 01:04:22.063
Tommy, where you going, man?

01:04:22.065 --> 01:04:23.697
Listen to me, I think we
head in this direction, all right,

01:04:23.699 --> 01:04:24.532
and stay quiet.

01:04:24.534 --> 01:04:25.200
No man, no, I say we stay here.

01:04:25.202 --> 01:04:26.300
Why do you want to go back?

01:04:26.302 --> 01:04:27.101
Stay here, man?
There's something inside.

01:04:27.103 --> 01:04:29.369
- We don't know what it is.
- Tommy!

01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:30.537
This house is the safest place
we'vebeen to.

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:32.039
I'm not going out there!

01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:34.409
Listen to me. I don't have a
good feeling about this, all right?

01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:35.510
- A good feeling?!
- I don't want to get trapped in there.

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:36.510
Bullshit!

01:04:36.512 --> 01:04:38.545
You just want to go back
so you can find Monica.

01:04:38.547 --> 01:04:39.646
Well, she's dead!

01:04:39.648 --> 01:04:41.449
Don't say that shit.

01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:43.450
Well, it's either that
or so you can keep filming.

01:04:43.452 --> 01:04:46.454
- Shh.
- Documenting this is not worth dying for!

01:04:46.456 --> 01:04:48.456
Listen to me. If I
don't keep filming this,

01:04:48.458 --> 01:04:50.458
no one is going to know
what happened here.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.894
Well, good luck getting it
on the five o'clock news.

01:04:52.896 --> 01:04:56.331
Oh god. Oh god.

01:05:28.697 --> 01:05:30.932
I don't see it anymore, man.
I think it's gone.

01:05:30.934 --> 01:05:32.934
Come on.

01:05:32.936 --> 01:05:34.704
I can't do this, Tommy.

01:05:36.606 --> 01:05:38.575
I can't do this anymore.

01:05:40.976 --> 01:05:42.913
- I can't.
- Ex.

01:05:44.514 --> 01:05:46.349
- Ex. Ex!
- I'm done.

01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:48.849
Ex, come on.

01:05:53.757 --> 01:05:58.592
You hear me, sons of bitches?!
I'm done!

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:01.762
Ex, what's
happening to you, man.

01:06:01.764 --> 01:06:03.731
I don't know.

01:06:03.733 --> 01:06:05.635
I don't know.

01:06:06.969 --> 01:06:08.869
Listen, listen, listen.

01:06:08.871 --> 01:06:10.304
I know we both
been through a lot, all right?

01:06:10.306 --> 01:06:14.474
These last few hours have been the
most confusing in my life but...

01:06:14.476 --> 01:06:15.876
...we gotta keep it together,
all right?

01:06:19.581 --> 01:06:21.351
It's five am.

01:06:23.753 --> 01:06:25.887
We're located
in the Catskill Park region

01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:27.858
of upstate New York.

01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:34.898
A few hours ago, we encountered
an alien presence.

01:06:38.934 --> 01:06:41.538
We lost two members of our team.

01:06:50.914 --> 01:06:52.516
This thing...

01:06:54.483 --> 01:06:55.686
...whatever it is...

01:06:58.954 --> 01:07:01.458
...doesn't want us
to leave this place.

01:07:04.527 --> 01:07:07.398
I never believed
in any of this stuff.

01:07:09.032 --> 01:07:10.800
Not really.

01:07:14.704 --> 01:07:19.510
Even now, it seems like it should
be taking place inside of a dream.

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:23.746
Well, it's not.

01:07:27.851 --> 01:07:29.952
You filming yourself again,
Tommy?

01:07:33.523 --> 01:07:35.559
Documenting reality?

01:07:39.262 --> 01:07:41.465
What reality is that?

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:48.471
That the reality
is gonna make you famous?

01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:53.976
It's going to make you known?

01:07:58.847 --> 01:08:00.951
I lost somebody!

01:08:03.085 --> 01:08:04.587
So did I.

01:08:14.998 --> 01:08:16.063
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:16.064 --> 01:08:17.734
No, it isn't.

01:08:28.978 --> 01:08:31.613
They're never gonna
let us out of here, Tommy.

01:08:42.091 --> 01:08:43.993
They're never gonna
let us out of here.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.738
Ex.

01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:57.640
Ex.

01:08:59.006 --> 01:09:00.644
Ex.

01:09:02.045 --> 01:09:03.514
Ex!

01:09:04.046 --> 01:09:05.612
Come on, man.

01:09:09.018 --> 01:09:11.622
Ex, come one!
Where you going?

01:09:18.795 --> 01:09:19.930
Ex.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:28.572
Ex?

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:37.046
We're in this together, man.

01:09:46.654 --> 01:09:48.822
Ex, what are you doing?

01:09:52.194 --> 01:09:53.193
Ex.

01:09:55.698 --> 01:09:57.034
Ex, it's me.

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:02.139
Take it easy.

01:10:05.207 --> 01:10:07.143
Ex, Ex.

01:10:08.711 --> 01:10:09.813
Ex.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.914
What did she look like?

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.719
Sam.

01:10:16.853 --> 01:10:18.788
What did she look like
when she died?

01:10:20.856 --> 01:10:21.955
What did she look like?!

01:10:21.957 --> 01:10:23.223
Ex, don't let them
get to your head, man.

01:10:23.225 --> 01:10:24.858
Don't let them get
into your head.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:26.128
It's me.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.796
It's me.

01:10:29.798 --> 01:10:35.268
No!

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:02.897
I know... I know...

01:11:02.899 --> 01:11:04.134
I know.

01:11:07.703 --> 01:11:09.038
I know.

01:11:10.273 --> 01:11:11.906
You okay?

01:11:11.908 --> 01:11:13.143
You're okay.

01:11:14.844 --> 01:11:16.177
Come on.

01:11:16.179 --> 01:11:17.780
Come on.

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:21.848
You're okay.

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:23.017
Okay.

01:11:47.143 --> 01:11:48.679
Did you hear that?

01:11:49.212 --> 01:11:51.144
What happened?
What was that?

01:11:51.146 --> 01:11:52.780
You didn't hear that, did you?

01:11:52.782 --> 01:11:55.148
- Hear what?
- I swear..

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:57.151
- What?
- I heard- I think I did...

01:11:57.153 --> 01:12:00.955
- Monica's voice.
- No.

01:12:00.957 --> 01:12:03.093
- I swear.
- No.

01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:06.527
It's impossible.

01:12:06.529 --> 01:12:08.896
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

01:12:08.898 --> 01:12:10.930
I s...

01:12:21.109 --> 01:12:22.912
I swear I heard...

01:12:27.115 --> 01:12:28.819
Monica!

01:12:30.252 --> 01:12:31.818
Monica!

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.153
Tommy!

01:12:33.155 --> 01:12:34.354
- Monica!
- Tommy.

01:12:34.356 --> 01:12:36.022
I swear I heard her this time.

01:12:36.024 --> 01:12:38.125
Dude, Tommy, stop screaming.

01:12:38.127 --> 01:12:39.226
Don't scream.

01:12:39.228 --> 01:12:41.829
Monica. I heard her.
I gotta go find her.

01:12:41.831 --> 01:12:45.031
What? No, Tommy, no.

01:12:45.033 --> 01:12:45.967
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:12:45.969 --> 01:12:47.968
- What?
- It doesn't matter!

01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:49.003
- Monica!
- Tommy.

01:12:49.005 --> 01:12:50.071
Tommy!

01:12:50.073 --> 01:12:51.272
- Monica, I'm coming!
- Tommy, wait.

01:12:51.274 --> 01:12:52.272
Tommy, come back.

01:12:52.274 --> 01:12:54.974
Come back!
Come back!

01:12:54.976 --> 01:12:56.143
Monica, where are you?!

01:12:56.145 --> 01:12:57.945
Tommy!

01:12:57.947 --> 01:13:00.083
Monica, Monica!

01:13:01.283 --> 01:13:02.282
I hear her.

01:13:02.284 --> 01:13:04.250
Monica.

01:13:04.252 --> 01:13:05.318
Monica!

01:13:25.408 --> 01:13:27.174
I taste blood.

01:16:11.506 --> 01:16:13.607
I've fired a shotgun before...

01:16:13.609 --> 01:16:15.345
...Shooting range.

01:16:40.603 --> 01:16:43.105
When I was
a kid, I was with you.

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.373
Ugh, it's so blurry.

01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:51.080
I keep trying to remember...

01:16:53.114 --> 01:16:54.483
...things from my past.

01:16:58.253 --> 01:16:59.553
I-I gotta get out of here.

01:17:06.429 --> 01:17:07.628
Monica?

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.265
Monica.

01:17:10.298 --> 01:17:11.434
Monica.

01:17:12.635 --> 01:17:14.003
Monica.

01:17:16.439 --> 01:17:18.008
Baby.

01:17:33.555 --> 01:17:35.190
Baby.

01:17:38.226 --> 01:17:39.496
You're okay.

01:18:09.692 --> 01:18:11.391
You're doing good.

01:18:11.393 --> 01:18:13.262
You're going to be okay.

01:18:17.466 --> 01:18:19.069
I got you.

01:18:19.601 --> 01:18:23.402
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:23.404 --> 01:18:27.277
Come on, baby.

01:18:31.479 --> 01:18:35.250
Please, please, please.

01:18:36.185 --> 01:18:37.617
Come on.

01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:39.486
Baby, baby, bay...
You'll be...

01:18:39.488 --> 01:18:41.691
You'll be.
You'll be okay.

01:18:42.658 --> 01:18:45.259
Come on, you'll be okay.
Yeah, come on.

01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:47.361
Yeah, come on.
Come on.

01:18:55.738 --> 01:18:57.370
I'm gonna get us out.

01:18:57.372 --> 01:19:00.109
We'll make it out, baby,
come on.

01:19:00.676 --> 01:19:02.509
We're safe.

01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:03.643
We're gonna be okay.

01:19:03.645 --> 01:19:05.312
We're gonna be okay!

01:20:09.578 --> 01:20:11.344
No.

01:20:16.452 --> 01:20:20.320
No!

01:20:25.327 --> 01:20:28.794
No! No!

01:20:28.796 --> 01:20:33.333
No!

01:20:33.335 --> 01:20:39.039
No!

01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.594
Tommy?

01:20:59.862 --> 01:21:02.332
Tommy, they'll find you.

01:21:39.635 --> 01:21:42.372
Baby.

01:22:20.943 --> 01:22:22.478
I love you.

01:23:11.527 --> 01:23:13.730
M... Monica?

01:23:14.462 --> 01:23:15.630
Monica?

01:23:32.547 --> 01:23:34.548
There is no escape...

01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:36.883
There is no escape.

01:23:47.662 --> 01:23:49.629
There is no escape...

01:23:49.631 --> 01:23:52.065
- Stop.
- They're coming.

01:23:52.067 --> 01:23:53.599
Hey! Hey!

01:23:53.601 --> 01:23:55.634
Stop!

01:23:55.636 --> 01:23:57.870
Where are you going?!

01:23:57.872 --> 01:23:59.705
Stop walking!

01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.709
Hey!

01:24:06.814 --> 01:24:08.013
Listen to me!

01:24:47.989 --> 01:24:49.755
Ah.

01:25:37.905 --> 01:25:40.106
Hey!

01:25:42.944 --> 01:25:44.945
Come on!

01:25:47.716 --> 01:25:50.786
You... want me?!

01:25:51.587 --> 01:25:53.620
You want me?!

01:25:53.622 --> 01:25:55.120
Come get me!

01:25:58.926 --> 01:26:01.628
Hey! I'm right here!

01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:02.998
Come on!

01:26:03.798 --> 01:26:05.835
