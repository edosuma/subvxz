00:07.140 --> 00:08.675
[cheering]

00:08.742 --> 00:09.943
[the Beast growls]

00:12.145 --> 00:16.383
[Tiki] It all began with 108
of the most elite athletes on Earth.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.623
[Chris] She got it! She got it!

00:24.524 --> 00:28.695
[Tiki] Now, after a season
of epic battles, only nine remain.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.571
Each with the courage, the strength,
and the heart to win it all.

00:39.572 --> 00:44.177
[Chris] Alberto Gotta, a champion climber
and Italy's great hope tonight.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.446
[Alberto] I can't wait
to make my country proud.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.548
[Bianca] Great, Alberto!

00:48.982 --> 00:50.150
[chanting] Come on the blues!

00:50.216 --> 00:53.720
[Tiki] A phenomenal climbing duo
rocketed Team France into the final,

00:53.787 --> 00:56.322
featuring one of the favorites,
Mickaël Mawem.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.192
-[Mickaël] Nothing can stop me.
-[Sandy] This guy is amazing.

00:59.492 --> 01:03.696
[Chris] China has a quartet of contenders,
led by Haibin Qu.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.800
[Tiki] Who may be the most dominant
Beastmaster we've ever seen.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.535
-[Qinyi] You can do it!
-[crowd] You can!

01:08.601 --> 01:11.271
I firmly believe
that I can get into the grand final

01:11.337 --> 01:12.939
and fight till the end.

01:13.039 --> 01:14.908
-[Chris] USA!
-[Tiki] USA!

01:14.974 --> 01:17.911
Two all-round athletes
representing the USA,

01:17.977 --> 01:20.780
led by OCR superstar, Kyle Soderman.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.650
[Kyle] I absolutely love the red,
white and blue. I'm here to win.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.518
[Chris] Walking up to the Beast.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.321
[Tiki] Brace yourself for a full throttle,

01:28.388 --> 01:30.990
battle royale of man versus Beast.

01:32.826 --> 01:37.831
It's time to find out who will become
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.701
[theme music playing]

01:48.775 --> 01:50.510
[loud cheering]

01:53.746 --> 01:54.948
[the Beast growls]

01:55.748 --> 01:57.884
[Tiki] Welcome, everyone,
to the main event.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.121
The championship night
of Ultimate Beastmaster.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.526
Tonight, nine competitors -

02:06.593 --> 02:08.061
the winners of each episode -

02:08.127 --> 02:13.466
are gearing up to throw down for a chance
to win the grand prize of $50,000

02:13.533 --> 02:16.269
and the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.571
[Chris] And you can feel the energy
around here!

02:18.638 --> 02:20.740
Everyone is hyped up for this finale.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.742
[Tiki] Yeah, this place is lit!

02:23.176 --> 02:24.177
It's going off.

02:26.212 --> 02:30.116
The nine Beastmasters we have here tonight
are the best of the best.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.218
France has two competitors running.

02:33.019 --> 02:34.554
Two French competitors -

02:34.621 --> 02:38.424
Mickaël Mawem and Manu Cornu.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.961
Both are climbers from the French team.
We're all here to support them.

02:42.028 --> 02:46.633
[Chris] China has the most finalists
of any country, with four running tonight.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.203
We have a higher rate of winning.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.738
However, our Chinese team

02:51.804 --> 02:53.306
is the one everyone must beat.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.109
All the contestants
are watching our performance.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.043
Let's go!

02:57.110 --> 03:01.681
[Chris] And of course, let's not forget
about our Italian friends, paesanos!

03:01.748 --> 03:02.982
Perfect.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.551
Turn to the other side.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.085
Show me the other one.

03:06.719 --> 03:08.655
How does it look?

03:08.721 --> 03:11.758
I'm an artist. You can't argue with that.

03:11.824 --> 03:15.261
-It's the least we can do for Alberto.
-Come on, Alberto!

03:15.328 --> 03:17.931
Go, Alberto!

03:17.997 --> 03:21.901
[Tiki] And the good old US of A
has two finalists competing tonight.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.138
-USA!
-USA!

03:25.939 --> 03:29.909
[Tiki] Unfortunately, not every country
qualified for tonight's grand finale.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.078
But we're glad to have Spain
with us anyway.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.815
Well, there are great competitors,
and great athletes to support.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.716
Indeed.

03:36.783 --> 03:40.220
We want to tell our athletes that
we are very proud of what they did.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.656
[Chris] And also joining us,
our friends from India.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.359
Victory to India.
India will win the next season.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.927
Wake up, Vidyut, wake up.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.195
-Next season.
-Wake up.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.097
-We will win.
-This is a reality show.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.933
We will definitely win next season.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.802
I will train all these Indians...

03:55.868 --> 03:58.004
I'm trying to pinch him. It's not working.

03:59.205 --> 04:02.375
-[Tiki] Any predictions, Chris?
-Somebody Chinese, most likely.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.977
No. American, baby!

04:04.043 --> 04:05.979
America! But most likely Chinese.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.180
USA!

04:07.380 --> 04:10.917
[Chris] Listen, I want Kyle Soderman
or John Gerzik obviously to win.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.986
The odds - Vegas has the Chinese.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.754
My heart, America.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.858
[Tiki] The Beast evolves, yet again,
to raise the championship bar.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.793
No one has seen anything like this,

04:20.892 --> 04:24.564
even if our nine Beastmasters
think they know what to expect.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.900
The Energy Coils are farther apart.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.204
The Mags fall off the Mag Wall
much faster.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.674
And the longer,
final leap to the finish line

04:34.741 --> 04:37.610
will take every ounce of fortitude
these athletes have

04:37.677 --> 04:38.978
to complete the level.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.582
All nine of our competitors
will compete in Level 1,

04:42.649 --> 04:45.118
but only six will make it to Level 2.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.519
Brace yourself.

04:46.586 --> 04:51.658
It's time to find out
who will become the Ultimate Beastmaster.

04:52.625 --> 04:57.230
Up first tonight we have
Mickaël Mawem from France.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.700
You might remember that Mickaël
had to beat his brother, Bassa,

05:00.767 --> 05:02.702
to get to this championship round.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.271
Now, he's trying to win it all
for his family.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.608
[Mickaël] I'm a professional boulderer.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.576
I came here with my brother, Bassa.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.378
We do everything together,

05:12.445 --> 05:16.449
except that, of course, there can only
be one Ultimate Beastmaster winner.

05:16.916 --> 05:21.321
As far as my sports career is concerned,
I've always wanted to be a world champion.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.389
I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.795
It's Mickaël's chance
to have a strong start,

05:28.861 --> 05:31.297
and perhaps become
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.465
We're off, Mickaël!

05:33.032 --> 05:36.002
Just for the final,
let's not root against them.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.105
When did you decide that?
You didn't consult with me.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.375
OK, then. Let's root against them
in the final as well!

05:42.909 --> 05:45.945
[Chris] Alright, and we're off
to the races, Mickaël Mawem.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.514
His brother Bassa is in the crowd,
cheering him on,

05:48.581 --> 05:51.417
hoping Mickaël can become
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.720
But also probs totes jelly.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.789
[Tiki] At this point,
it will come down to execution.

05:56.856 --> 06:00.493
He was the French speed climbing champion
in 2011.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.463
He's a completely well-rounded athlete.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.231
And that's why he's here tonight.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.935
[Chris] Mentally, right now,
we're gonna see who is a champion.

06:09.001 --> 06:12.472
Because there's a lot of money
on the line, and a big title on the line.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.541
We may see some
of our best athletes slip up,

06:15.608 --> 06:17.577
because mentally they're too nervous.

06:17.643 --> 06:18.611
[Tiki] You're right.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.782
He told us earlier,
this is his least favorite obstacle.

06:22.849 --> 06:27.820
Of all the obstacles tonight,
this is the one he really doesn't like.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.323
It's hard,
because there's no climbing involved.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.692
[Tiki] Remember, as an added challenge,

06:32.759 --> 06:35.628
these Energy Coils
have been moved farther apart.

06:36.496 --> 06:39.165
[commentators groan]

06:39.232 --> 06:40.833
[Chris] You see what I'm saying?

06:40.900 --> 06:44.270
[Tiki] How disappointing is this?

06:44.337 --> 06:45.438
Shit!

06:46.439 --> 06:49.008
I can't watch, I can't... He fell.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.079
-It's the obstacle Mickaël most feared.
-Exactly.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.515
[Tiki] Mickaël Mawem,

06:55.581 --> 07:00.353
who had the second highest
point total of 640 points,

07:00.420 --> 07:03.189
falls on the first jump.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.123
Wow!

07:04.190 --> 07:05.925
[Tiki] With just 35 points.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.494
[Chris] Last time around,
he completed all of Level 1.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.997
He literally got through
every single obstacle.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.099
He was one of
the few competitors to do so.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.135
Look at the dejection
in his face right now.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.838
I've done this my whole career.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.907
You fall, you get back up.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.109
That's how it goes.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.812
[Tiki] Our next competitor, Bin Fang,

07:25.878 --> 07:28.881
is the first of our four
Chinese finalists tonight.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.217
There he is with that bow and arrow.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.755
[Tiki] You may recall that Bin Fang
is a wild boar hunter.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.157
He's been hunting beasts all his life.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.027
-Clear the level!
-[woman] Bin Fang.

07:41.093 --> 07:41.961
Clear the level!

07:42.228 --> 07:44.397
[Tiki] Bin Fang,
the first time he went through,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.767
he completed Level 1
in the fastest time yet.

07:47.834 --> 07:48.668
Goodness.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.271
You're China's Houyi.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.006
-Houyi shot down the suns.
-Shoot!

07:54.073 --> 07:55.808
Can he shoot down

07:56.342 --> 07:57.276
the Beast today?

07:57.343 --> 07:58.878
-Yes.
-Let's wait and see.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.516
[Chris] Bin Fang easily going from
Grinder to Grinder, no problems there.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.852
Let's see how he goes from two to three.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.154
I don't see any issues for him on Grinder.

08:08.554 --> 08:12.525
[Tiki] Because of the nature of the
competition in this championship round,

08:13.059 --> 08:14.927
time could come into play.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.162
It is the tiebreaker.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.900
[Chris] And Bin Fang easily gets on
to the first Energy Coil.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.369
He's going for the Point Thruster.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.672
No problems, he got to the Coil.
Let's see if he gets the Thruster.

08:26.739 --> 08:30.176
The first time through,
go for the Point Thruster.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.111
-He got it.
-Excuse me!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.913
Bin Fang already has 50 points.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.850
-Oh, and he just made it!
-[Tiki] Just made it.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.352
These competitors, they're fatigued.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.456
Their muscles start
to build up lactic acid,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.324
and wear down over time.

08:45.391 --> 08:48.528
This is a competition that takes
serious levels of endurance.

08:48.594 --> 08:49.595
This is the big jump.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.297
This one is roughly 12 feet.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.699
The average elite male can broad jump

08:54.133 --> 08:56.402
roughly 8.5 feet.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.504
-[Chris] Oh, Bin Fang!
-[Tiki] Bin Fang nails it!

08:59.405 --> 09:01.440
-Bin Fang.
-[crowd] You can do it!

09:01.507 --> 09:03.209
-Bin Fang.
-You can do it!

09:03.509 --> 09:06.479
-[Tiki] Bin Fang on to Dead Bolts.
-[Chris] Dead Bolts.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.347
Frankenstein.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.350
[Tiki] This is all about effectiveness...

09:12.318 --> 09:14.820
quickness, and body control.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.356
[Chris] Upper body
and core strength is huge.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.759
[commentators and crowd groan]

09:19.825 --> 09:21.928
That's too bad.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.197
For Bin Fang, upper body
has always been his strength.

09:25.598 --> 09:30.503
However, mistakes were made.
He fell into the water at Mag Wall.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.371
[Tiki] What happened?

09:32.438 --> 09:34.707
[Chris] What happened to Bin Fang there?

09:34.774 --> 09:35.641
[Chris groans]

09:35.708 --> 09:37.410
[Tiki] You can see, he just missed.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.346
Chris, here's what I see
with our first two competitors.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.149
They're almost too confident

09:43.215 --> 09:45.952
that they can run through
Level 1 with ease.

09:46.018 --> 09:47.420
John! John!

09:47.486 --> 09:49.755
[Tiki] John Gerzik of the United States

09:50.356 --> 09:53.459
takes on the championship round
of Beastmaster.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.396
[John] Growing up as a kid,
I did all sorts of sports.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.265
I did football, basketball, track.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.634
Then I started
getting into more gymnastics.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.603
I did gymnastics through high school.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.806
I'm a high school physics teacher,
competing for my students.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.407
I'm competing for my kids.

10:08.474 --> 10:09.475
[growls]

10:10.076 --> 10:12.445
[John] I'm gonna see this course
and take it apart.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.181
I am the Ultimate Beastmaster.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.187
[Tiki] John, off to an excellent start,
cruising through Level 1.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.255
Now, he's approaching Faceplant.

10:23.489 --> 10:24.323
John! John!

10:24.390 --> 10:26.258
[Tiki] Getting cheers from the Americans.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.395
This physics teacher from Texas

10:29.462 --> 10:32.264
has been one of the great stories
so far on Beastmaster.

10:33.766 --> 10:37.770
[Chris] And no problem
getting to the first Energy Coil.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.239
The Energy Coils,

10:40.306 --> 10:41.907
you can't see at home, but we can,

10:41.974 --> 10:43.476
they're a little bit slippery.

10:43.542 --> 10:47.146
[Tiki] You'll notice that John
is using a split-jump technique.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.482
-Oh!
-Oh, wow!

10:49.548 --> 10:51.984
My goodness,
my heart just stopped for a second.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.720
[Tiki] He barely
got back to that Energy Coil.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.991
-[Chris] And that's how Mickaël fell.
-[Tiki] Yes, it is.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.160
That split-jump technique

11:01.227 --> 11:05.531
allows you to not have to jump
as far with both feet.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.433
[cheering]

11:07.500 --> 11:09.268
[Tiki] John lands it perfectly.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.970
Now, he's on to Dead Bolts.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.606
[crowd applauding]

11:14.573 --> 11:16.809
[Chris] There's a Point Thruster
that he's going for.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.478
[Tiki] He gets the Point Thruster.
10 extra points for him.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.552
[Tiki] Now, he has just taken the lead

11:26.752 --> 11:28.854
in the championship round of Beastmaster,

11:28.921 --> 11:31.290
as he goes for the longest jump
of the Dead Bolts.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.725
[Chris] He's gonna jump here.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.293
-And he got it!
-[Tiki] He makes it!

11:34.360 --> 11:36.729
[Chris] With height to spare!
Did you see how high he got?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.998
[Tiki] Now, John Gerzik has to land
on the Mag Wall.

11:39.465 --> 11:40.499
[Chris] Boom. Made it.

11:40.566 --> 11:44.070
[Tiki] Remember, those Mags are dropping
faster in this championship round,

11:44.136 --> 11:45.671
so John's got to get his move on.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.273
[Chris] There's no time to think.

11:47.339 --> 11:48.908
You think, you're in the drink.

11:49.341 --> 11:50.810
[Tiki] He picks up five more points.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.344
He missed the Point Thruster.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.414
He's got to make that final jump
to the platform,

11:55.481 --> 11:57.316
which has been moved farther away.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.784
He's thinking of going back.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.120
He doesn't have to worry about it.
He lands it!

12:01.187 --> 12:02.154
[Chris] He finished!

12:02.221 --> 12:04.356
[Tiki] What a great run by John Gerzik!

12:05.157 --> 12:07.860
-He made it!
-Great, John!

12:07.927 --> 12:10.096
Awesome.
John holds the top spot for now.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.665
[Tiki] The American setting the pace

12:12.732 --> 12:15.534
in the championship round of Beastmaster.

12:15.601 --> 12:16.902
[Chris] Johnny!

12:16.969 --> 12:20.506
Super performance,
super technique, super brain.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.541
-A brilliant performance, wow!
-Yeah!

12:22.608 --> 12:27.546
[chanting] USA! USA!

12:27.613 --> 12:29.181
-USA!
-USA!

12:29.248 --> 12:31.517
I feel good, I'm thinking about my son.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.852
He wants me to do this.

12:32.918 --> 12:33.819
I know it.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.222
Abra... ca-dab-ra.

12:36.288 --> 12:39.158
[John] I wish I'd got that Point Thruster,
I would have gone for it,

12:39.225 --> 12:40.326
but it was too far back.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.561
I didn't wanna get stuck
in a bad situation.

12:42.628 --> 12:45.965
I have all the confidence that
Kyle's gonna make it over here with me.

12:46.031 --> 12:49.168
I need my other USA competitor
to make it to me completely dry.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.870
Because we're going all the way.

12:50.936 --> 12:51.937
Level 4, baby.

12:52.004 --> 12:55.107
[Tiki] John Gerzik picks up 110 points.

12:55.574 --> 12:59.478
Six more competitors left to run
the championship round of Level 1.

12:59.545 --> 13:00.613
Come on!

13:00.679 --> 13:02.081
[Chris] The Chinese are excited,

13:02.148 --> 13:05.117
because up right now is their
second competitor of the night,

13:05.184 --> 13:07.153
and the shortest athlete in the finals,

13:07.219 --> 13:08.320
Yiqi Li.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.722
[high-pitched] He's so little!

13:10.823 --> 13:12.825
I feel that Yiqi Li is in top form today.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.996
You can see that he's calm and steady.

13:17.396 --> 13:20.499
-[crowd] Come on!
-[man] Yiqi!

13:22.735 --> 13:23.936
-Go!
-Yes.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.438
He's at the Energy Coils.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.241
[Tiki] Let's see if he can get through
these first two levels

13:29.308 --> 13:32.378
and get a chance
at redemption for Level 3,

13:32.444 --> 13:34.580
where he failed on the Ejector.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.517
Opting not to go for the first
Point Thruster opportunity.

13:38.584 --> 13:42.388
-Yes!
-He avoided falling into the blood.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.456
[Tiki] He makes the longer
of the Coil jumps.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.926
Now, he's on to the Dead Bolts.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.127
You can do it.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.429
Dry your hands.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.032
[Chris] Yiqi Li has actually
never done the Dead Bolts,

13:53.098 --> 13:56.635
because if you remember, he climbed
the opposite way on the course.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.638
[Tiki] Hit the 10 point Point Thruster.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.241
Yes, he didn't have these Dead Bolts.

14:02.308 --> 14:03.809
He went through the Crash Pads.

14:06.946 --> 14:07.880
There he goes.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.348
Yes, he makes it!

14:09.415 --> 14:12.117
Yiqi Li handling the Dead Bolts,

14:12.184 --> 14:15.287
as he's about to make the leap
to the Mag Wall, and he gets on it.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.691
These Mags fall every second,
so you've got to move through quickly.

14:18.757 --> 14:19.992
There goes the first one.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.261
There goes the second one,
and the third one.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.963
Fourth one is falling behind him.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.765
He's moving with quickness,
but they're catching up.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.668
He missed the Point Thruster
and it's smart to go by it.

14:29.735 --> 14:32.171
These Mags are gonna fall
before he gets to the end.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.272
[Chris] He's got to jump!

14:33.339 --> 14:34.640
[Tiki] He's got to jump off.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.641
Oh, and he missed it!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.443
[commentators groan]

14:37.509 --> 14:39.645
[Tiki] Yiqi Li crashed down hard.

14:40.746 --> 14:44.316
I think he hurt his shoulder
on the platform. Let's hope he's OK.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.918
[Tiki] Let's watch this in replay.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.354
You see the Mag at his foot fell.

14:49.855 --> 14:50.689
[Tiki groans]

14:50.756 --> 14:51.590
Ouch!

14:51.891 --> 14:53.192
[Chris] That definitely hurt.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.995
[Tiki] Let's see. He just missed
the edge of the mat.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.530
And then rolls off
into the blood of the Beast.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.234
Just like gymnasts in the Olympics,

15:02.301 --> 15:04.436
you have to stick the landing.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.907
So Yiqi Li,
as impressive as that run was,

15:07.973 --> 15:11.810
will not get the five points
for finishing the level.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.280
But an impressive run nonetheless.

15:14.346 --> 15:19.151
That puts him in second place
behind America's John Gerzik.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.222
[Chris] Next up, from Italy,

15:23.522 --> 15:24.990
Alberto Gotta!

15:25.057 --> 15:26.325
Italia!

15:26.392 --> 15:30.396
I need absolute silence
in every Italian home.

15:30.462 --> 15:31.730
Concentration.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.999
Because this is...

15:34.066 --> 15:35.734
"the finale,"

15:35.801 --> 15:38.037
as the Americans call it.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.407
This is his chance to bring home
the $50,000.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.577
I started climbing at the age of four,

15:45.644 --> 15:47.680
but I was always destined

15:47.746 --> 15:49.481
to do rock climbing.

15:49.548 --> 15:53.018
I have many pictures of my mom
when she was pregnant,

15:53.085 --> 15:54.920
and she is on the mountains.

15:54.987 --> 15:59.191
So, even if I didn't pick up
rock climbing out of sheer passion,

15:59.258 --> 16:01.827
I would have probably started anyway,

16:01.894 --> 16:05.064
because my father passed it on to me
before I was born.

16:05.130 --> 16:10.903
I want to win because I know I deserve it,
after everything I've done over the years.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.272
I can't wait to make my country proud.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.175
[cheering]

16:16.241 --> 16:19.611
-And he's off! Go Alberto!
-Let's go.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.914
I didn't enjoy saying that...

16:22.614 --> 16:25.384
[Tiki] Gotta did not finish
any of the levels,

16:25.451 --> 16:28.387
but he got into the championship round
in Level 4

16:28.454 --> 16:30.222
and got all the way to the Sky Hook.

16:30.289 --> 16:33.158
-He got on the Grinder.
-Go on, Alberto!

16:34.793 --> 16:36.128
My heart is pounding.

16:36.195 --> 16:40.065
Go on, Alberto.
You have nothing to fear!

16:40.132 --> 16:41.533
Just do your thing.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.603
[Chris] Alberto
is a national climbing champion.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.072
But climbing really isn't that necessary

16:47.873 --> 16:48.741
in Level 1.

16:48.807 --> 16:52.244
It is if you get to the Dead Bolts,
but this is all jump and fearlessness.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.712
Alberto! Alberto!

16:53.779 --> 16:55.814
The Faceplant!

16:55.881 --> 16:57.149
Don't rush.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.952
Take all the time that you need, Alberto.

17:03.622 --> 17:04.455
[Chris and Tiki] Oh!

17:04.522 --> 17:05.523
No, no!

17:05.590 --> 17:07.960
Come on, Alberto! Pull yourself up!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.194
He can make it.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.430
Come on, Alberto!

17:11.497 --> 17:13.464
Great, Alberto!

17:13.531 --> 17:16.001
Great! He made it!

17:16.068 --> 17:19.671
[Chris] And Francesco literally
almost jumped off the booth,

17:20.039 --> 17:22.907
and barreled himself into the monitor.

17:23.474 --> 17:26.011
We're Italians. You know it, Bianca.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.014
We're Italians and we must always suffer.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.149
[Tiki] Can he get it done?

17:31.350 --> 17:32.618
No!

17:32.684 --> 17:34.586
[Chris] Gotta!

17:34.653 --> 17:36.789
[Tiki] Alberto Gotta fails.

17:37.022 --> 17:39.825
[Chris] Gotta, Gotta, Gotta!

17:39.892 --> 17:42.194
[Francesco] I'm not getting up again.

17:42.261 --> 17:45.431
For me, the final ends here.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.333
The final ends here.

17:49.768 --> 17:53.872
[Chris] And the Italians are upset right
now. I don't wanna go near their booth.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.107
[Tiki] How disappointing!

17:55.574 --> 17:57.776
I'm risking elimination now.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.913
My coordination on that jump was bad.

18:01.346 --> 18:04.783
I didn't get a good running start
on the back leg.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.852
My technique was completely wrong.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.956
He fell in the same spot
as Mickaël Mawem,

18:11.023 --> 18:13.092
but it took him longer to get there.

18:13.158 --> 18:18.030
So now Alberto Gotta is in last place.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.698
-[Tiki] Guys.
-She's crying.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.600
-I know.
-[Tiki] Those are real tears.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.869
-I know, I know.
-I really care.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.505
[Tiki] Wow, let's group this.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.941
OK, me next. Can I have a hug next?

18:29.575 --> 18:30.776
Bianca.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.780
-[Francesco] I'm a bit jealous.
-I'm sorry.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.415
Now they're taking advantage.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.851
[Chris] You know what?
Hopefully France loses.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.853
-Yes.
-We'll root against France.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.723
[Chris] And Bin Xie up next for China.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.358
No relation to Bin Fang.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.130
He gracefully threw his jacket
onto the sidelines.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.799
It shows his determination

18:53.866 --> 18:55.834
to fight until the end.

18:57.069 --> 19:01.807
[Bin Xie] My dad is a construction worker,
so I followed him wherever he went.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.243
I studied wherever he worked.

19:04.710 --> 19:08.614
I studied at Yunnan, went back
to Hunan and then Guangdong,

19:08.680 --> 19:12.284
so my life was a little messy.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.522
I wanted to join the military,
but my parents didn't want me to.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.290
I was in the military for two years.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.059
It's time for me to fight
for my country's glory.

19:24.129 --> 19:28.734
[Tiki] Now, in Level 1, Bin Xie
made it all the way to the Mag Wall,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.135
but could not finish.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.504
[Chris] Bin Xie on to the Faceplant.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.107
Bin Xie's nickname is "The Monkey King."

19:35.174 --> 19:36.975
-Bin Xie, you can do it!
-Here he goes.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.677
-Bin Xie, you can do it!
-OK.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.578
With a swing.

19:39.645 --> 19:40.746
[Chris] Nailed it.

19:40.812 --> 19:43.015
Bin Xie is at the Energy Coils.

19:44.883 --> 19:45.884
[Tiki] Very focused.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.520
There he goes.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.721
He lands.

19:49.788 --> 19:53.559
I've got to say, I'm very surprised
that he's passing on the Point Thrusters.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.795
It's not a smart strategy to stay alive
in this competition.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.498
[Chris] Yeah, you need all the points
you can get at this stage.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.267
That was close.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.770
Look, he's displaying the power of China.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.672
-China's strongest!
-Power of China.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.006
[Tiki] Now on to the Dead Bolts.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.776
[Chris] OK, remember at Level 1
he got both Point Thrusters

20:10.842 --> 20:13.812
on Dead Bolts and Mag Wall,
but did not complete the Mag Wall.

20:14.846 --> 20:17.849
[Tiki] And he just missed that
Point Thruster, there on Dead Bolt.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.987
He thought about the Point Thruster
but decided against it.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.655
[Chris] Interesting.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.426
[Tiki] His timing is a bit off as he tries
to make this jump, but he nails it.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.494
[applause]

20:29.561 --> 20:32.231
[Tiki] And now,
it's on to Mag Wall for Bin Xie.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.465
[Chris] Oh, he held on!

20:35.334 --> 20:38.437
[Tiki] He just saw his countryman
get to this point and take a dive.

20:38.503 --> 20:39.972
Those Mags fall every second,

20:40.038 --> 20:42.074
so you have to really move through it.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.976
[Chris] Bypasses the Point Thruster again!

20:44.042 --> 20:45.978
[Tiki] Yeah, those Mags
are catching up to him.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.314
Looks like he's gonna get a chance
to make a jump, and he does!

20:50.215 --> 20:51.483
He can't stick it either!

20:51.550 --> 20:52.751
[groaning]

20:54.286 --> 20:55.520
Goodness.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.689
-Ah!
-Oh, no, buddy.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.759
Why didn't you eat this morning?
You should have eaten.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.527
Look at him, busy practicing.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.430
[Tiki] He knows those Mags
are falling behind him,

21:05.864 --> 21:08.900
and he doesn't gather himself,
actually he kind of just slips.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.936
So, he had to make the best that he could,

21:11.470 --> 21:13.538
and just missed hanging on.

21:14.373 --> 21:17.175
It's disappointing.
I'm disappointed with myself.

21:17.242 --> 21:18.844
[Tiki] Why are they not finishing?

21:18.910 --> 21:19.945
Who?

21:20.012 --> 21:22.080
Your two competitors, they can't finish.

21:22.648 --> 21:23.582
Uh...

21:23.949 --> 21:25.384
Because... because...

21:25.651 --> 21:29.087
the competitors are waiting for me
to finish this competition.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.990
-They're waiting for Bin Gu.
-So Xie Bin can't finish it.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.960
You've got to come running,
we're all gonna come running.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.662
[Tiki] Let's check out the leaderboard

21:36.728 --> 21:39.765
before the first elimination run
of tonight's finale.

21:39.831 --> 21:44.102
As you can see from the scores,
the Point Thrusters mean everything.

21:44.169 --> 21:47.039
That's because Point Thruster king,
John Gerzik,

21:47.239 --> 21:49.374
is leading with 110 points.

21:49.708 --> 21:53.245
Second place is Yiqi Li of China,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.280
who comes in with 90 points.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.515
And on the bubble,

21:56.581 --> 21:59.685
Italy's lone representative,
Alberto Gotta.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.920
Only the top six will advance to Level 2.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.556
Manuel Cornu,

22:04.956 --> 22:09.027
also one of our really strong competitors
from Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4.

22:09.761 --> 22:14.232
Finished with 610 points
and the title of Beastmaster.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.968
But can he follow through
in the championship round?

22:17.269 --> 22:18.236
We'll find out now.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.241
[Manuel] My favorite sport is bouldering.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.010
I'm here to win.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.114
My hair is my signature.
It's how people recognize me.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.983
On this side, I've got a leopard,

22:32.050 --> 22:35.954
which is a very charismatic,
powerful animal, and very fast too.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.358
And on this side,
I've got the Ultimate Beastmaster logo,

22:39.424 --> 22:41.126
because I'm going to win this show.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.964
[Chris] Of course, wouldn't you know it?

22:46.031 --> 22:49.401
The France versus Italy rivalry
is coming to a head here.

22:49.468 --> 22:53.672
Italy's on the bubble,
and Manuel Cornu could knock them out.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.842
-It's France versus Italy.
-Of course it is!

22:56.908 --> 22:58.643
Manu, we're all rooting for you!

22:59.678 --> 23:01.279
[crowd cheering]

23:01.346 --> 23:03.181
We're the French team!

23:03.248 --> 23:04.349
He's getting ready.

23:04.416 --> 23:07.185
We recognize him
from his awful hair style.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.788
Let's see what happens now.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.556
I hope he falls in the Grinder.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.826
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu
flying through the Grinder here.

23:15.093 --> 23:18.130
[Chris] We hated him at first,
because of that stupid cheetah haircut,

23:18.196 --> 23:19.531
but now we kind of like him.

23:20.832 --> 23:24.336
Manu's most dreaded obstacle tonight,
he told us, are the Energy Coils,

23:24.403 --> 23:26.972
which were also Mickaël's downfall.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.876
Come on, Cornu! Just miss the chain!

23:31.343 --> 23:32.811
Poof! Poof!

23:32.878 --> 23:35.647
[Tiki] At this point,
because they've all completed Level 1,

23:36.548 --> 23:37.949
it's all about focus.

23:38.216 --> 23:41.286
He easily grabs the chain high and lands.

23:41.353 --> 23:42.354
[Chris] Oh!

23:42.421 --> 23:44.423
[Tiki] He didn't let go of the chain
fast enough.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.659
He's currently tied with Alberto Gotta.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.096
So, if Manu makes this jump
to the next Energy Coil,

23:51.163 --> 23:54.266
he's gonna knock Gotta
and Italy out of the finals.

23:54.566 --> 23:58.069
-I can't look.
-His entry into Level 2 is riding on this.

23:58.136 --> 24:01.273
-Tell me what's happening.
-Come on, it's the Energy Coil!

24:03.809 --> 24:05.544
It's OK, he did it!

24:09.047 --> 24:10.816
-Italy, goodbye.
-Bye-bye Italy!

24:11.817 --> 24:13.718
Our Alberto is out.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.787
Alberto is officially out.

24:16.254 --> 24:18.123
With 35 points...

24:18.824 --> 24:20.492
he's eliminated.

24:22.494 --> 24:23.829
[Tiki] He lands it.

24:25.397 --> 24:26.698
Actually, pretty easily.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.902
On to the Dead Bolts, for Manuel Cornu.

24:31.436 --> 24:34.739
Points are so important
for positioning at this point.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.477
Let's see if he goes
for the Point Thruster.

24:38.543 --> 24:42.047
-[Chris] Interesting technique here.
-[Tiki] Yes, he is a boulderer.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.783
He did get the Point Thruster.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.285
He's a boulderer,
so you see him using his feet

24:47.819 --> 24:48.854
to rest his arms.

24:49.621 --> 24:50.589
Building momentum

24:50.655 --> 24:54.125
to jump to the last of the Dead Bolts,
and then on to the Mag Wall.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.763
[Chris] Let's see how
his bouldering skills pay off here,

24:58.830 --> 25:00.999
this is where they're gonna come in handy.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.368
[Tiki] Especially because
you have to move so quickly

25:03.435 --> 25:06.304
around this Mag Wall,
as they fall off every second.

25:07.472 --> 25:10.442
This is rock climbing,
so no problems here.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.577
-Yes!
-Go, Manu!

25:12.644 --> 25:14.546
Manu! Manu! Manu!

25:15.780 --> 25:17.849
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu,
having a hell of a run.

25:17.916 --> 25:19.684
[Chris] This kid is flying through.

25:19.751 --> 25:23.688
-Go for it!
-One, two, and... three!

25:23.755 --> 25:25.056
-No, no, no.
-And...

25:25.257 --> 25:27.859
-Three! Well, if Manu--
-And... three!

25:27.926 --> 25:29.427
There we go, he's going for it.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.498
[Tiki] Oh, he can't make that jump!

25:33.965 --> 25:35.634
[Chris] And he can't make the jump.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.903
[Tiki] Wow, he hit that
really, really hard.

25:37.969 --> 25:42.440
-He really hurt himself there!
-No, he's really done his ribs in.

25:42.507 --> 25:43.808
Manu, don't do this to me.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.343
[groans]

25:45.410 --> 25:46.611
Let's watch the replay.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.881
[Tiki] There's the hard fall that he took.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.583
[Chris and Tiki groan]

25:51.650 --> 25:55.320
[Manuel] I've hurt my knee.
I'll have to get it looked at.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.689
I'm keeping some energy back for later.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.958
It's not over. I'm going to get warm.

26:00.625 --> 26:04.129
To get through Levels 2, 3, and 4
with a potential injury like that,

26:04.529 --> 26:05.530
we'll see.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.399
[Tiki] A very impressive run.

26:07.465 --> 26:10.001
100 points for Manuel Cornu,

26:10.068 --> 26:14.005
which puts him into second place
behind American, John Gerzik.

26:14.072 --> 26:18.476
But also puts fellow countryman
Mickaël Mawem in sixth place,

26:18.543 --> 26:21.913
and in danger of being eliminated
from tonight's finale.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.116
[cheering]

26:26.051 --> 26:27.285
[Tiki] Haibin Qu

26:27.719 --> 26:29.154
walking up, flexing.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.622
Flexing before the Beast.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.425
He should be flexing before it,
because he owned it.

26:33.491 --> 26:34.826
-Haibin!
-[crowd] You can do it!

26:34.893 --> 26:37.829
[Tiki] The high point earner
through the first rounds.

26:37.896 --> 26:38.763
[klaxon sounds]

26:38.830 --> 26:40.532
[Tiki] He must be one of the favorites.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.933
[Chris] I think so, for sure.

26:43.902 --> 26:47.172
I hope Haibin Qu,
as the leader of our Chinese team,

26:47.238 --> 26:50.542
can be like a lightning bolt,
like a dagger,

26:50.609 --> 26:54.179
piercing the clouds,

26:54.245 --> 26:57.882
shining upon all the Chinese contestants.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.691
[Tiki] Haibin Qu making easy work
of the Grinder.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.961
[Chris] Yeah, every competitor so far
has flown through these Grinders.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.896
[cheering]

27:12.764 --> 27:15.500
[Tiki] Mickaël Mawem is on the bubble.

27:15.900 --> 27:20.872
My lover will be the greatest hero alive
and he'll come and marry me.

27:20.939 --> 27:25.944
-Could he be Haibin Qu?
-Luckily, this isn't a matchmaking show.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.447
[Chris] Most competitors
avoiding that Point Thruster.

27:29.881 --> 27:33.284
[Tiki] He is now tied
with Mickaël Mawem from France.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.554
[Chris] If he lands this,
Mickaël Mawem is out.

27:36.621 --> 27:39.724
[Tiki] Haibin Qu, makes the jump!

27:40.058 --> 27:41.793
But just barely hangs on.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.362
Goodness!

27:44.429 --> 27:47.098
-It was so close.
-He went across!

27:47.799 --> 27:49.701
[Chris] That was pure strength,
right there.

27:49.768 --> 27:53.872
Mickaël Mawem waving bye-bye
to the camera because he is eliminated.

27:53.938 --> 27:56.007
-No!
-And there we have it.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.076
[screams]

28:00.945 --> 28:02.147
[Tiki] This is a longer jump,

28:02.213 --> 28:05.850
so he's got to try a different strategy
to the one he just did.

28:06.117 --> 28:09.120
And he's thinking about it.
He tries it again, but he nails it.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.823
[Chris] Yeah, he made it in Level 1,
why couldn't he make it now?

28:14.659 --> 28:16.461
He's unleashing his emotions.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.563
[Bin Gu yells]

28:18.630 --> 28:22.534
[Tiki] As you look at Haibin Qu, you can
tell that was the part of the course

28:22.600 --> 28:24.569
that he knew was going to challenge him.

28:24.636 --> 28:27.172
[Chris] That was keeping him up at night,
but he nailed it.

28:27.238 --> 28:29.607
[Tiki] He nails it,
because he is a climbing champion.

28:29.674 --> 28:33.078
His strength is in his shoulders,
his forearms and his hands.

28:33.144 --> 28:36.548
That's 10 additional points.
He nails that one pretty easily.

28:40.485 --> 28:41.886
[cheering]

28:43.321 --> 28:45.957
[Tiki] He'll jump on to the Mag Wall
after one more swing here.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.662
[loud cheering]

28:50.729 --> 28:53.932
[Chris] He's been on the Chinese
national climbing team since he was 15.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.066
[Tiki] And he's flying.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.969
He hits the Point Thruster
on the Mag Wall, gets the high road.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.505
[Chris] Wow,
he's going really high on this one.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.473
Woo!

29:01.539 --> 29:03.742
-OK Haibin, you can do it.
-You can do it.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.911
-Don't injure yourself.
-Don't be nervous.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.316
[Tiki] Oh, he makes it, just barely!

29:11.382 --> 29:12.217
He made it!

29:12.283 --> 29:13.585
[Chris] Wow!

29:14.719 --> 29:16.454
Who the hell is gonna beat that guy?

29:16.755 --> 29:20.792
-He succeeded!
-This is the battle cry of China.

29:20.859 --> 29:24.696
One of our Chinese contestants
cleared the level.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.799
-He almost fell, but that was great!
-By the skin of his teeth!

29:27.866 --> 29:29.567
-What an awesome landing!
-Great!

29:30.135 --> 29:32.403
[Tiki] Haibin Qu with 105 points,

29:32.804 --> 29:36.007
just short of our leader, John Gerzik.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.342
[Chris] That was awesome.

29:38.676 --> 29:42.080
[Tiki] But Haibin Qu somehow lands it.
I mean this is an awkward leap.

29:42.413 --> 29:44.616
[Chris] Fearless, completely fearless,
Haibin Qu.

29:44.682 --> 29:47.619
[Tiki] He sees out the corner of his eye,
the Mags falling behind him.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.921
-[Chris] Did you see his knee?
-[Tiki] The same thing.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.122
[Chris] I don't know how...

29:51.189 --> 29:53.758
[Tiki] These competitors
have strong joints and muscles.

29:53.825 --> 29:54.793
[Chris] My goodness!

29:54.859 --> 29:55.860
Hey!

29:56.394 --> 29:58.963
[Tiki] Well Chris, at least the French
are being good sports

29:59.030 --> 30:00.799
about Mickaël's elimination.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.369
[Chris] Let me tell you, if we get bounced
by the Chinese, I am not hugging them.

30:05.036 --> 30:08.306
[Tiki] That epic run
puts Haibin Qu in second place.

30:08.373 --> 30:11.209
But because he didn't get
that first Point Thruster,

30:11.276 --> 30:13.978
he's five points behind our leader,
John Gerzik.

30:14.045 --> 30:17.382
And now, Bin Xie is on the bubble,

30:17.448 --> 30:20.051
and his fate hangs in the balance.

30:21.186 --> 30:22.854
With one more competitor to go -

30:23.421 --> 30:25.023
American, Kyle Soderman.

30:25.256 --> 30:28.760
[Chris] Our American hero can guarantee
himself a spot in Level 2,

30:28.827 --> 30:30.862
if he can score 85 points.

30:30.929 --> 30:32.463
[cheering]

30:34.032 --> 30:35.600
My competitive drive really...

30:36.000 --> 30:40.004
makes me wanna push the limits
in all of the action sports I do.

30:40.071 --> 30:44.309
I love the feeling of doing these sports
that could potentially get you hurt.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.144
Just getting that adrenaline high.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.180
I'm gonna, not just dominate this Beast,

30:49.247 --> 30:51.482
I'm gonna dominate every other country.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.519
I absolutely love the red, white and blue.
I'm here to win.

30:56.387 --> 30:57.922
Woo!

30:57.989 --> 30:59.757
[chanting the national anthem]

30:59.824 --> 31:04.729
[Tiki] The Americans singing the national
anthem, as Kyle Soderman makes his way

31:05.797 --> 31:07.832
to the mouth of the Beast.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.936
[Chris] ♪ And the home
Of Kyle Soderman ♪

31:12.303 --> 31:15.473
[Tiki] He was five points short
of a perfect score in Level 1.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.443
Just falling short on the Mag Wall,

31:18.509 --> 31:20.511
but he got all of the Point Thrusters.

31:24.415 --> 31:28.019
[Tiki] One of our strongest competitors
out of the entire round, Kyle Soderman,

31:28.319 --> 31:31.055
making his way through the Grinder
and on to Faceplant.

31:31.522 --> 31:33.191
[Chris] Let's hope that he's just young,

31:33.424 --> 31:34.559
and, you know, stupid.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.595
So he won't think about
how important this is, he'll just do it.

31:37.662 --> 31:38.830
[Tiki] I completely agree.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.866
[Chris] As an older guy I'd be like,
"Oh, my God. What could happen?"

31:41.933 --> 31:44.168
Hopefully he's just like,
"This is awesome."

31:44.235 --> 31:46.404
I love this kid.
Do you think he looks like me?

31:46.471 --> 31:49.440
[Tiki] He does, except
he's 40 pounds lighter and more athletic.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.142
Wow, I love cheese.

31:51.776 --> 31:52.744
Sue me.

31:54.312 --> 31:57.815
-[Chris] Yeah, Kyle! Easy son.
-[Tiki] Easy jump for him.

31:58.049 --> 31:59.717
50 points so far for Kyle Soderman.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.152
He's 35 points away

32:01.619 --> 32:04.255
from clinching his spot
in the second level.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.090
Being encouraged by his teammates.

32:06.157 --> 32:10.194
He's got to make this slightly longer jump
back to the Energy Coil, which he does

32:10.261 --> 32:11.229
with relative ease.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.163
A bit of a stumble,

32:12.230 --> 32:15.500
because it's a bit higher
jumping back than it is jumping over.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.804
You can really see the advantage that
height gives you on these broad jumps.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.372
This one is a little bit longer.

32:25.043 --> 32:28.279
Now, it's on to the Dead Bolts
for Kyle Soderman.

32:29.247 --> 32:30.348
Number one, USA!

32:30.415 --> 32:31.449
[Chris] Number one.

32:31.849 --> 32:32.951
Come on, Kyle.

32:33.217 --> 32:34.519
Grab on to that Dead Bolt.

32:35.053 --> 32:38.289
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman
went through the Dead Bolts with ease

32:38.356 --> 32:39.958
the first time through Level 1.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.829
Now, he just hit
the second Point Thruster,

32:46.698 --> 32:48.967
as he's now moving on to the Dead Bolts.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.104
Kyle Soderman can deal
a huge blow to Team China,

32:53.171 --> 32:57.075
by knocking out Bin Xie,
if he makes it to that last Dead Bolt.

32:58.042 --> 33:01.079
Kyle Soderman, if he lands this jump,
will move on to Level 2.

33:01.145 --> 33:04.015
-He has qualified for Level 2.
-[Chris] Kyle's in Level 2.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.818
[Tiki] Now, Kyle Soderman
will make a run on the Mag Wall.

33:06.884 --> 33:10.521
Let's see how effectively he can
get through. They fall every second.

33:10.588 --> 33:11.823
Is he prescient enough

33:11.889 --> 33:15.126
to hit the last of the Point Thrusters?

33:15.193 --> 33:16.227
And he is.

33:16.294 --> 33:19.297
Kyle Soderman is beasting the Beast
right now.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.898
Level 1, he's owning it.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.500
[loud cheering]

33:22.567 --> 33:25.570
[Tiki] He's tied with John Gerzik.
He jumps easily with confidence.

33:26.237 --> 33:27.805
No problem for Kyle.

33:27.872 --> 33:29.374
That was better than Haibin Qu!

33:29.440 --> 33:31.342
That's how we do it in America!

33:31.843 --> 33:34.445
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman with a perfect run

33:34.512 --> 33:38.016
through Level 1 in the championship round
of the Ultimate Beastmaster.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.752
120 points for Kyle Soderman.

33:40.818 --> 33:44.322
Americans leading this competition.
One and two.

33:44.389 --> 33:47.058
-[Paula] Congratulations!
-[Chris] Spain!

33:47.125 --> 33:48.726
-America!
-You are the best!

33:48.793 --> 33:51.062
-[Chris] España!
-[Tiki, in Spanish] Thanks, Spain!

33:51.462 --> 33:53.097
I did exactly what I came out to do.

33:53.297 --> 33:56.934
I wanted to get every Point Thruster,
get every single point I could.

33:57.001 --> 34:00.405
USA is gonna take number one and two,
all the way up to Level 4.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.507
I'm the guy to beat right now.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.842
They're gonna be following me
the whole way.

34:05.076 --> 34:06.878
Perfect score, that's how we do it!

34:08.379 --> 34:09.746
You see what's happening!

34:09.813 --> 34:15.152
So, now the competition
is just between two countries.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.954
-America and China.
-US and China.

34:17.522 --> 34:20.958
I think China can pass over.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.428
-No one can beat us.
-Wow, no, no, no.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.563
Bin Gu talking trash.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.533
[Tiki] Now remember,
this is a cumulative scoring game.

34:28.599 --> 34:31.268
So, points matter on every single level.

34:31.335 --> 34:36.340
Haibin Qu is sitting behind Kyle Soderman
by 15 points already.

34:36.641 --> 34:40.610
There's a lot of distance to cover
for China's Bin Fang and Yiqi Li.

34:42.146 --> 34:43.547
See you next level.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.116
-See you next level.
-See you.

34:45.716 --> 34:48.853
[Chris] Going in to Level 2,
it's America, one, two.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.123
[Tiki] It's time to get to Level 2.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.428
The atmosphere out here
is at a fever pitch.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.597
The crowd is going bananas.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.599
People are jacked up for Level 2.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.801
Let's hear what the athletes are thinking.

35:05.036 --> 35:08.673
[Haibin] I'm 15 points away from first
place and five points from second place.

35:09.307 --> 35:14.011
The rest aren't as good as me.
I can easily surpass them.

35:14.078 --> 35:16.814
My strategy for Level 2
is to get all the possible points.

35:16.881 --> 35:20.084
I wanna get every Point Thruster
and leave nothing behind.

35:20.151 --> 35:23.821
I'd like a 20 point cushion
going into Level 3, if I make it that far.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.159
[Manuel] I've seen the physio,
and he's bandaged my knee.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.728
I can... I can deal with it.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.965
It hurts a little bit
around my knee, but...

35:34.899 --> 35:36.033
it will be OK.

35:36.601 --> 35:39.237
[Tiki] These athletes
think they know Level 2.

35:39.303 --> 35:43.307
But tonight, it's more intense
than anything they've ever experienced.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.042
Stomach Churn spins faster.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.078
Digestive Track sinks quicker.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.815
And there's increased distance
between each link in Chain Reaction.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.718
These athletes will have to be
sharper, speedier,

35:53.784 --> 35:56.154
and more agile than ever before.

35:56.220 --> 35:59.957
Six of them enter Level 2,
and only the top four will advance.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.927
[Chris] Alright, and Level 2
is about to begin.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.197
Leading us off from China, Haibin Qu.

36:08.432 --> 36:11.169
When I turned 12,

36:11.235 --> 36:16.774
I officially became a rock climber
in the Guangshen region.

36:17.074 --> 36:18.109
I worked really hard.

36:18.176 --> 36:22.480
My confidence has been built
by my passion for my country.

36:22.547 --> 36:25.983
It's time for me to fight
for myself and my country's glory.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.722
[Tiki] Now, there are
six competitors here,

36:31.789 --> 36:34.592
in Level 2 of the Ultimate Beastmaster.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.862
Only four of them will go on to Level 3.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.497
[Chris] Haibin Qu's got some hops.

36:39.564 --> 36:42.833
[Tiki] He does have some hops,
these things get further apart as we go.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.702
-He's a professional climber.
-Yes.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.138
So for him, climbing is an easy job.

36:47.672 --> 36:49.807
[Tiki] But being a climber,
you see his technique.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.210
He pushes off with his bottom hand,

36:52.276 --> 36:55.513
as opposed to trying
to fully pull up with his top hand.

36:56.747 --> 36:59.517
One more easy jump
to finish off Spinal Ascent,

37:00.351 --> 37:03.087
and Haibin Qu will be
on to Spinal Descent.

37:04.021 --> 37:06.357
-[man] Haibin!
-[crowd] You can do it!

37:08.793 --> 37:10.995
[Chris]
Wow, here's an interesting technique.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.965
-[Tiki] I think he did that to have fun.
-[Chris] Yeah.

37:14.432 --> 37:17.168
[Tiki] Like, "how far can I fall before
I have to grab myself?"

37:17.802 --> 37:22.240
Haibin Qu actually completed this level
the first time through,

37:22.306 --> 37:24.542
and he got Point Thrusters
on Spinal Descent.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.777
Also on Chain Reaction and Vertabrace.

37:26.844 --> 37:29.714
[Chris] Let's see if he goes for
the Point Thruster. He's deciding.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.015
[Tiki] You know he's going to.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.585
He's in a tight race with
Kyle Soderman and John Gerzik.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.955
-Nice, he got the bonus points.
-Yes.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.824
[Chris] Alright, we're at Stomach Churn.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.993
And this will be interesting
for Haibin Qu,

37:42.059 --> 37:45.429
because he's been saying that jumps
on this course are his weakness,

37:45.496 --> 37:48.399
and Stomach Churn is spinning much faster.

37:50.067 --> 37:51.802
Nice.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.871
-Does he want the Thruster?
-Stand firm.

37:57.475 --> 37:58.876
Nicely done.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.611
I think he landed badly.

38:00.678 --> 38:04.682
Next up is the Digestive Track.

38:09.086 --> 38:10.554
[Tiki] That Digestive Track

38:10.621 --> 38:12.690
is dipping into the blood of the Beast.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.659
So, if you don't get off quickly,

38:14.725 --> 38:17.428
that jump on to the Dreadmill
is much more difficult.

38:17.895 --> 38:20.231
Haibin seems to be stuck
in the Digestive Track.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.632
[crowd] You can do it.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.601
Haibin Qu, you can do it!

38:23.668 --> 38:24.702
Jump high!

38:25.670 --> 38:27.738
-[Tiki] He jumps and makes it!
-[Chris] He made it!

38:27.805 --> 38:28.906
[Tiki] He hangs on.

38:28.973 --> 38:29.874
Nicely done.

38:31.275 --> 38:32.810
[audience cheering]

38:34.000 --> 38:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

38:43.487 --> 38:44.488
[Chris] Wow!

38:44.555 --> 38:46.190
Haibin Qu!

38:46.657 --> 38:50.261
[Tiki] On to the top of the platform
where he gets on to Chain Reaction.

38:50.795 --> 38:54.432
Haibin Qu, jumps high on the chains.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.701
Pretty sure he'll go
for the Point Thruster,

38:56.767 --> 38:58.002
which he does and nails.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.503
That's 10 extra points.

38:59.937 --> 39:02.106
Haibin is a rock climber,

39:02.173 --> 39:05.142
so he has a strong upper body.

39:05.242 --> 39:07.878
[Chris] It's really important
to stay high on the chains.

39:07.945 --> 39:09.747
If you have to climb up the last chain,

39:09.814 --> 39:11.882
you have no way to get through Vertabrace.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.618
[Tiki] Yeah, your arms
just get way too fatigued.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.787
Trying to generate momentum.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.422
[Chris] Oh!

39:19.023 --> 39:21.158
-[Chris] That was smart.
-[Tiki] Great technique.

39:21.225 --> 39:24.261
Now, he's got a series of six jumps
through the Vertabrace.

39:24.328 --> 39:25.930
The challenge here is mental,

39:25.996 --> 39:30.167
because you know you're jumping
and landing on a very hard surface.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.470
You're taking this
right in the solar plexus.

39:32.536 --> 39:36.073
[Chris] Right in the solar plexus for
sure, and these things weigh 200 pounds.

39:37.174 --> 39:38.309
Nicely done.

39:38.976 --> 39:43.280
His success will be a driving force
for the Chinese team to move forward.

39:43.347 --> 39:45.850
Look at him, he's so tired.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.220
However, he's still doing his best.

39:49.286 --> 39:50.955
-You can do it.
-It's the last one.

39:51.689 --> 39:53.457
[Qinyi] You can do it! You're the best!

39:53.924 --> 39:55.126
[Chris] This guy is all guts.

39:55.192 --> 39:57.027
I mean, how do you not love this guy?

39:57.094 --> 39:59.230
He won't stop, he's like the Terminator.

39:59.296 --> 40:00.865
Or how do you say that in Chinese?

40:00.931 --> 40:02.566
Tiki, I think he's gonna do it!

40:04.268 --> 40:05.403
Yeah!

40:05.469 --> 40:07.538
-Good!
-All the way through!

40:07.605 --> 40:09.240
-Beautiful.
-Nice.

40:09.306 --> 40:10.674
[loud cheering]

40:13.110 --> 40:16.414
[Tiki] Haibin Qu, through Levels 1 and 2,

40:16.480 --> 40:19.150
has 240 points.

40:20.818 --> 40:22.953
After he struggled a bit at the beginning,

40:23.020 --> 40:25.156
he quickly had to move up Digestive Track,

40:25.222 --> 40:28.325
and barely made that Dreadmill
landing.

40:28.392 --> 40:29.260
[Chris] Wow.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.497
That was great. Why do I feel like crying?

40:33.764 --> 40:35.900
Hey, it's only Level 2.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.603
-Great level!
-[Qinyi] Oh, my God!

40:40.304 --> 40:41.172
Oh, my God!

40:41.238 --> 40:42.573
[Francesco] You have one for me?

40:42.640 --> 40:45.009
Yeah! I have another one.

40:45.075 --> 40:46.944
OK, mouth!

40:49.246 --> 40:51.315
Finally, finally shut up!

40:51.682 --> 40:52.683
[cheering]

40:54.251 --> 40:56.253
Let's do it! Woo!

40:56.320 --> 40:59.423
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman of the United States
is up next.

40:59.490 --> 41:03.194
And the first time he went through
Level 2, he was absolutely perfect.

41:03.260 --> 41:06.564
Oh, my God. Almost falls off
the back of the platform there.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.032
[Chris] Kyle is so amped!

41:08.098 --> 41:11.068
He cannot afford to make
any dumb mistakes like I would.

41:11.135 --> 41:15.306
[Tiki] Kyle had a perfect run in Level 1,
Chris, 120 points.

41:15.906 --> 41:17.942
There was only 120 points available.

41:18.008 --> 41:19.844
-[Chris] He's Mr. Perfect.
-[Tiki] He is.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.879
He is Mr. Perfect, you could say that.

41:21.946 --> 41:23.848
[cheering]

41:24.515 --> 41:26.617
[Tiki] Kyle is very long and lean,

41:26.684 --> 41:27.918
but strong, lean.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.954
Makes his way down Spinal Descent.

41:30.020 --> 41:33.390
You know for a fact that
he is going to go for this Point Thruster.

41:33.457 --> 41:35.459
As he curtsies to the Americans

41:35.860 --> 41:36.827
cheering him on.

41:36.894 --> 41:38.229
Why don't we do a little...

41:39.697 --> 41:40.831
[laughs]

41:42.700 --> 41:43.634
[Tiki] And he gets it.

41:45.269 --> 41:46.604
[Chris] Wow. He did a little bow.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.406
Hey, what are you doing, buddy?
Let's have some action.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.343
[Tiki] As long as he doesn't dab.

41:52.776 --> 41:54.545
[Chris] The dabs were the worst
in Level 1.

41:54.612 --> 41:56.714
He's marching like a Continental Soldier.

41:56.780 --> 41:57.681
I love it.

41:58.816 --> 42:02.152
[Tiki] There he goes, on to the second
of the Stomach Churns.

42:03.621 --> 42:04.989
Slowly, but steadily.

42:05.055 --> 42:06.924
He gets the second Point Thruster.

42:06.991 --> 42:09.460
[Chris] No problem,
that's all core strength and balance.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.494
Oh, Kyle.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.297
[Tiki] Kyle is happy and confident
right now.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.832
Let's hope not too confident,

42:14.899 --> 42:17.301
as he gets ready to take on
the Digestive Track.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.271
[Chris] Alright, no problems
getting in to the Digestive Track.

42:20.337 --> 42:22.740
[Tiki] Now here's the thing,
he's got to move quickly.

42:22.806 --> 42:25.743
It's important that he gets
through with a lot of height,

42:26.043 --> 42:28.679
because this jump to the Dreadmills
can be hard.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.048
[Chris] He had time to spare.
Did you see that?

42:31.115 --> 42:32.116
He had a few seconds.

42:32.182 --> 42:33.517
He flew through that thing.

42:33.584 --> 42:35.986
[Tiki] Kyle is dominating Level 2.

42:36.453 --> 42:37.721
[Chris] He needs to keep this up

42:37.788 --> 42:40.424
because Haibin choo-choo train
has set the pace.

42:41.825 --> 42:43.994
-And he made it!
-[Tiki] Wow, that was impressive.

42:44.962 --> 42:47.431
He looks like
he's not even breaking a sweat.

42:47.498 --> 42:48.999
USA!

42:50.234 --> 42:52.303
[Tiki] There he is, high up on the chain.

42:52.369 --> 42:53.571
[Chris] Yeah, smart move.

42:54.305 --> 42:57.007
[Tiki] Easily gets
the third Point Thruster.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.243
[Chris] This is all strength, right here.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.245
[Tiki] All upper body strength,
you're right.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.081
You see the bend in his elbows,
they call that the "L".

43:04.381 --> 43:05.649
If you keep the "L" strong,

43:05.716 --> 43:08.686
you have much more capability
of getting your swing on

43:09.019 --> 43:10.921
and getting to that first Vertabrace.

43:11.188 --> 43:13.657
He's got a little bit of work to do,
to get back to it.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.459
[Chris] I've taken a lot of L's
in my life.

43:15.893 --> 43:17.761
[Tiki] Now, he's got to climb high
obviously.

43:17.828 --> 43:19.897
[Chris] He's got to really use
a lot of strength.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.165
He got a Point Thruster,

43:21.231 --> 43:23.167
so even if he doesn't get to Vertabrace,

43:23.233 --> 43:24.435
which I hope he does,

43:24.501 --> 43:26.003
at least he got 10 points.

43:26.337 --> 43:27.571
[Tiki] He might be stuck here!

43:27.871 --> 43:29.106
Come on, Kyle!

43:30.774 --> 43:32.142
[Tiki] He's gonna concede.

43:32.209 --> 43:35.813
[Chris] Haibin Qu crushed Level 2
and got all the way through.

43:35.879 --> 43:38.215
Kyle didn't even get to Vertabrace,

43:38.282 --> 43:40.684
and still is only 5 points
behind Haibin Qu.

43:40.751 --> 43:42.753
[Tiki] That's the power
of the Point Thrusters.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.555
You see him get that second one.

43:44.888 --> 43:46.790
He jumps on to the Dreadmills,

43:46.857 --> 43:48.525
and gets another Point Thruster.

43:48.592 --> 43:49.827
That's 30 extra points.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.062
I got through those chains, but...

43:52.363 --> 43:54.632
I was getting pretty gassed with my hands.

43:54.698 --> 43:57.201
Those chains are slippery.
They're hard to hold on.

43:57.267 --> 43:58.335
It is what it is.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.304
I'm just hoping I get on to Level 3,

44:00.638 --> 44:02.239
and I'll make up for it there.

44:04.475 --> 44:08.879
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu is next.
He finished Level 1 with 100 points.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.415
Here's what happened in Level 1.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.551
Jumping off the Mag Wall,
he landed so awkwardly.

44:14.618 --> 44:16.320
Looked like he cracked his rib.

44:16.387 --> 44:18.756
But in actuality, he hurt his leg.

44:18.822 --> 44:22.493
[Chris] Tell you what, he'll need a lot
of leg power getting up Spinal Ascent.

44:22.559 --> 44:23.961
[Tiki] Let's see how he fares.

44:24.695 --> 44:29.500
Manuel Cornu eliminated Italy's
lone representative, Alberto Gotta,

44:29.566 --> 44:30.567
back in Level 1.

44:30.901 --> 44:33.537
I'm definitely not rooting for Cornu.

44:34.104 --> 44:38.442
[Tiki] He's having some trouble
mounting the Spinal Ascent pad.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.477
[Chris] Yeah, see,
but there's the leg power.

44:41.045 --> 44:42.846
[Tiki] And he's frustrated by this.

44:42.913 --> 44:46.150
-He's in pain. He hurt himself.
-He's in pain.

44:47.351 --> 44:52.423
-His knee's giving him trouble.
-Let's hope not too much.

44:53.323 --> 44:55.759
[Tiki] Climbers are smart,
with using that bottom hand.

44:55.826 --> 44:58.962
He's got to make a big effort.
He manages to do so.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.230
[Chris] It was tough though.

45:00.297 --> 45:03.767
[Tiki] When you're compromised,
you find other ways to accomplish things

45:03.834 --> 45:05.936
that are usually pretty easy for you.

45:06.003 --> 45:07.571
[Chris] Spending a lot of energy.

45:08.772 --> 45:10.874
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu going down
Spinal Descent.

45:11.942 --> 45:14.545
He'll have a decision,
like everyone at the bottom,

45:14.611 --> 45:16.246
whether to go for the Thruster.

45:16.313 --> 45:19.349
As we saw with Kyle Soderman,
who just ran before,

45:19.416 --> 45:21.552
those Point Thrusters can be invaluable.

45:22.352 --> 45:24.021
[cheering]

45:24.588 --> 45:25.456
Come on the blues.

45:25.522 --> 45:27.424
All supporting their last athlete,

45:27.491 --> 45:31.161
who could potentially win
the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

45:32.229 --> 45:34.231
[Tiki] He did get the Point Thruster.

45:34.298 --> 45:38.235
Now here's where it gets interesting.
We can see Cornu is favoring his leg.

45:38.669 --> 45:41.572
How's he going to handle
these jumps on Stomach Churn?

45:41.638 --> 45:43.340
He negotiates the first one.

45:46.276 --> 45:49.346
Oh! Almost off the side
of the Stomach Churn.

45:49.913 --> 45:54.051
He did not look comfortable going there,
looks like he's gonna lose his balance.

45:54.118 --> 45:55.619
You can't delay, just jump!

45:56.320 --> 45:58.122
-[Chris] He made it on!
-[Tiki] He makes it!

45:58.188 --> 46:00.057
-Well done, Manu.
-Doing well.

46:00.691 --> 46:03.393
-[Sandy] Come on, champion!
-[Gilles] Come on, big guy!

46:04.828 --> 46:07.965
[Chris] Now, Manuel Cornu getting ready
to go up the Digestive Track.

46:09.099 --> 46:10.501
Oh, having a little trouble.

46:10.567 --> 46:13.137
[Tiki] Slipping a little bit,
speed is of the essence here.

46:13.737 --> 46:17.241
As that Digestive Track begins
to sink down into the blood of the Beast.

46:17.307 --> 46:20.978
If you don't get up to it with enough
height to jump on to the Dreadmill,

46:21.044 --> 46:22.212
it is a leap.

46:24.081 --> 46:26.483
He's gonna have to jump quickly,
otherwise...

46:26.784 --> 46:28.519
-Oh, he made it!
-[Chris] Made it!

46:28.585 --> 46:31.121
[Tiki] Just barely gets on the edge
of the Dreadmill.

46:32.556 --> 46:35.392
-[Chris] OK, he's taking his time.
-[Tiki] Got to slow down a bit.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.227
[Chris] What a gutsy performance.

46:37.294 --> 46:40.764
-I kind of like him after all.
-Yeah, he's not that bad.

46:40.831 --> 46:42.499
Yeah, he's nice.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.468
Even though he's French.

46:46.603 --> 46:48.472
-[Tiki] There.
-[Chris] He knows what to do.

46:48.539 --> 46:49.940
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu,

46:50.007 --> 46:53.277
fighting through
Level 2 of the Beastmaster.

46:53.343 --> 46:58.182
Manu has really hurt his leg.
What he's doing here is superhuman.

46:59.283 --> 47:02.152
-[Tiki] There he goes.
-[Chris] Nice somersault for no reason.

47:02.419 --> 47:03.287
Thank you!

47:06.924 --> 47:09.726
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu is on
the French national bouldering team.

47:09.793 --> 47:11.962
[Chris] Wow, he's flying
through Chain Reaction.

47:12.029 --> 47:15.699
[Tiki] And inexplicably going past
the Point Thruster.

47:15.766 --> 47:17.434
[Chris] I think he just wants to finish.

47:17.501 --> 47:19.303
[Tiki] If finishing is his goal,

47:19.770 --> 47:22.039
he better be sure
he gets to this Vertabrace.

47:23.273 --> 47:24.174
-Oh!
-Wow!

47:24.241 --> 47:26.443
-Go Manu!
-Come on! You can do it!

47:27.444 --> 47:29.146
[Gilles] We've never seen that!

47:29.213 --> 47:31.415
-Go! Go!
-Come on!

47:31.882 --> 47:34.351
[Chris] Wow, that was
his bouldering skills right there.

47:34.418 --> 47:36.353
[Tiki] Absolutely, take a leap of faith.

47:36.420 --> 47:39.289
Because if he doesn't land that hand
on that Vertabrace,

47:39.356 --> 47:41.758
he's likely falling
into the blood of the Beast.

47:42.659 --> 47:44.361
[Chris] Wow, this kid is tough.

47:44.962 --> 47:47.064
-He's really giving us a show!
-Amazing!

47:47.998 --> 47:51.902
-Oh, my goodness, Manu.
-Take your time, Manu!

47:52.236 --> 47:54.605
[Chris] Manuel Cornu
is going through Vertabrace.

47:55.072 --> 47:58.642
-[Tiki] He just got that Point Thruster.
-[Chris] And look at Haibin Qu.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.210
He knows Manu is coming for him.

48:00.277 --> 48:03.046
-♪ Manu to win! ♪
-[crowd] ♪ Manu to win! ♪

48:03.113 --> 48:04.948
♪ He's going to make it through! ♪

48:05.015 --> 48:06.717
[crowd] ♪ He's going to make it through! ♪

48:07.184 --> 48:08.719
Go Manu!

48:09.419 --> 48:12.356
[Tiki] 220 points for Manuel Cornu.

48:13.657 --> 48:15.659
[Chris] Oh, he almost fell off there!

48:15.726 --> 48:16.927
[Tiki] Almost lost that one.

48:21.698 --> 48:23.700
-[Chris] Oh, oh, oh!
-[Tiki] Oh!

48:23.934 --> 48:28.005
No points for that last Vertabrace,
but he is allowed to go around it.

48:28.071 --> 48:29.573
So the finish counts!

48:29.640 --> 48:30.908
[Chris] He crushed Level 2.

48:31.308 --> 48:33.977
[loud cheering]

48:35.545 --> 48:38.615
He completed it. He finished.
He can't believe it. Bravo!

48:38.682 --> 48:41.084
-Yay.
-Wow.

48:41.151 --> 48:42.686
He finished in fabulous style.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.722
-Bravo, Manuel.
-He made it. Manuel made it.

48:45.789 --> 48:48.592
And the French are celebrating like crazy.

48:51.428 --> 48:53.931
[Tiki] Wow, watch this! Oh, man!

48:54.431 --> 48:57.768
What an unbelievable grab by Manuel Cornu.

48:57.834 --> 49:00.537
-[Chris] That was unbelievable.
-[Tiki] He's psyched about it.

49:00.804 --> 49:04.074
But because he did not go through
that last Vertabrace,

49:04.141 --> 49:06.443
but did land on the finishing mat,

49:06.710 --> 49:12.049
he will get the five points for finishing,
but not for going through that Vertabrace.

49:12.349 --> 49:13.350
Interesting also,

49:13.417 --> 49:17.454
he is now five points behind our
second place competitor, Kyle Soderman.

49:17.921 --> 49:19.523
[all cheering]

49:22.292 --> 49:23.727
Well done!

49:23.794 --> 49:24.828
Congratulations!

49:24.895 --> 49:27.731
I couldn't really bend my knee.

49:29.166 --> 49:30.701
But, there we go. I'm happy.

49:33.437 --> 49:34.338
I'm happy.

49:34.972 --> 49:39.776
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu is now in third place
with a total of 230 points,

49:39.843 --> 49:42.279
along with Haibin Qu and Kyle Soderman.

49:44.181 --> 49:45.749
-[crowd] You can do it!
-[man] Yiqi!

49:45.816 --> 49:51.154
[Chris] Next up on Level 2,
is five foot six Yiqi Li of China.

49:53.190 --> 49:55.459
After I graduated from college,

49:55.525 --> 49:58.628
I didn't think of finding a stable job.

49:59.896 --> 50:02.499
When I got into my profession,

50:02.566 --> 50:07.270
my parkour training gave me an advantage.

50:07.537 --> 50:09.940
I learnt some parkour movements,

50:10.007 --> 50:12.709
and my knowledge of physics

50:12.776 --> 50:16.179
means I can analyze and perform better.

50:16.613 --> 50:20.450
When I do parkour, I feel free.

50:22.185 --> 50:27.724
There's a saying -
the runner up is the biggest loser.

50:27.791 --> 50:30.260
I'll prove myself
through this competition.

50:33.964 --> 50:36.366
[Tiki] Yiqi Li down Spinal Descent.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.137
Yiqi Li, already a Beastmaster,

50:40.203 --> 50:42.172
as are all our competitors

50:42.706 --> 50:44.274
in this championship round.

50:44.341 --> 50:45.175
The question is,

50:45.242 --> 50:49.980
which one of these six will end up
being the Ultimate Beastmaster?

50:50.047 --> 50:53.917
[Chris] Nice, and finally my question
was answered - Yiqi Li has an innie.

50:56.686 --> 51:00.791
[Tiki] Going for the first Point Thruster.
He gets it relatively easily.

51:00.857 --> 51:02.726
Back up to the Stomach Churn.

51:03.026 --> 51:08.565
He has 130 points now.
He still needs to earn 100 more points.

51:08.632 --> 51:09.833
You can do it, Yiqi Li.

51:11.368 --> 51:15.872
[Tiki] Trying to get the bearings
to make the second leap in Stomach Churn.

51:16.540 --> 51:18.508
-And there he goes, a jump.
-[Chris] Nice!

51:18.575 --> 51:20.343
Going for the Point Thruster

51:20.410 --> 51:22.946
is too difficult due to his height.

51:25.782 --> 51:26.650
[Chris] Oh!

51:26.983 --> 51:28.118
Nice jump!

51:28.885 --> 51:32.589
[Tiki] Remember, Yiqi Li, the first time
through this second level,

51:33.090 --> 51:36.593
barely made it on to the Dreadmills
off the Digestive Track.

51:36.660 --> 51:39.096
So, he's really got to fly up here,

51:39.162 --> 51:41.932
so he can make this jump
much easier for himself.

51:42.866 --> 51:44.034
Speed is of the essence,

51:44.101 --> 51:47.437
as the Digestive Track
sinks down into the blood of the Beast.

51:49.906 --> 51:50.874
Yiqi Li.

51:51.274 --> 51:53.210
-Ah, wow.
-Oh, wow.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.911
Flying jump. Whoa!

51:54.978 --> 51:58.515
-[Bin Gu] Nicely done.
-I'm starting to like him more.

51:58.582 --> 52:00.650
We didn't have a strong impression of him,

52:00.717 --> 52:06.556
but he has cleared the obstacles
one by one up until now.

52:08.258 --> 52:11.161
[Tiki] He's got one more leap
off the second Dreadmill.

52:14.264 --> 52:16.533
There he goes.
He makes it onto the Landing Pad.

52:21.671 --> 52:22.873
[cheering]

52:23.707 --> 52:26.643
[Tiki] He's going for the Point Thruster,
he can't quite reach it.

52:28.378 --> 52:30.714
This is the disadvantage
of being five-six.

52:32.582 --> 52:33.550
There he goes!

52:33.617 --> 52:36.219
-Nice, he kicked four times.
-Yes.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.621
[Tiki] He finally gets it.

52:37.687 --> 52:39.156
Those points are important for him,

52:39.222 --> 52:42.125
because he started this
level with only 90 points.

52:43.093 --> 52:45.829
Now, he's got to some way
increase his momentum.

52:46.463 --> 52:48.665
How he gets to this Vertabrace,
I don't know.

52:48.732 --> 52:51.201
It's gonna take
a Herculean effort for sure.

52:53.637 --> 52:55.305
[woman] You can do it!

52:55.872 --> 52:57.574
[man] You can do it!

52:58.508 --> 53:00.210
-[Tiki] Just missed it!
-[Chris] Wow!

53:00.677 --> 53:03.146
-[Tiki] Now he's way too low.
-[Chris] He's way too low now.

53:03.213 --> 53:05.248
[Tiki] At this point,
you might wanna concede.

53:05.315 --> 53:07.350
Yiqi Li is having some trouble here.

53:09.085 --> 53:13.990
Hooking his legs and feet so that he can
take a little pressure off his hands.

53:14.558 --> 53:16.293
-Yiqi Li!
-You can do it!

53:16.359 --> 53:19.996
-Yiqi Li!
-You can do it!

53:20.997 --> 53:22.465
[Tiki] No, he can't hold on!

53:25.735 --> 53:27.404
Yiqi Li with a valiant effort,

53:27.470 --> 53:32.142
but spent a lot of time contemplating
his next steps on that Chain Reaction.

53:32.509 --> 53:35.545
Yiqi Li, only 105 points on Level 2,

53:35.612 --> 53:39.783
which gives him
a grand total of 195 points.

53:39.849 --> 53:43.019
Which is only good enough
for fourth place so far.

53:43.086 --> 53:45.088
Right now he's in, but he's on the bubble.

53:45.555 --> 53:48.858
From here on out, somebody's
gonna get cut from the competition.

53:48.925 --> 53:52.896
[Tiki] Up next, John Gerzik
brings 110 points from Level 1.

53:53.730 --> 53:57.634
As he looks to eliminate Yiqi Li,
who is sitting on the bubble.

53:57.701 --> 54:00.904
And to do that, he's got to make it
to at least Chain Reaction.

54:01.538 --> 54:03.773
[Chris] Johnny G, baby,
flexing those pipes.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.976
[Tiki] Gerzik,
our tallest competitor at six-two,

54:06.042 --> 54:07.911
should easily move up Spinal Ascent.

54:07.978 --> 54:10.180
Remember, in the regular rounds, Level 2,

54:10.347 --> 54:14.551
John Gerzik slipped
going up the Digestive Track.

54:14.618 --> 54:17.821
Had to reset, he saved himself
on the Stomach Churn.

54:17.887 --> 54:19.489
Got back up, and had a struggle.

54:19.556 --> 54:21.791
But then he got a little bit
over confident.

54:21.858 --> 54:24.427
Jumped onto Chain Reaction
with too much velocity,

54:24.494 --> 54:26.429
and slipped into the blood of the Beast.

54:27.030 --> 54:29.366
[Chris] John is putting on
a clinic so far.

54:29.833 --> 54:33.303
Letting Yiqi Li know that
he is coming for his spot in Level 3.

54:33.903 --> 54:37.007
[Tiki] John Gerzik came into Level 2
in second place.

54:37.774 --> 54:40.777
Can he keep his mojo,

54:41.911 --> 54:44.347
and put himself comfortably into Level 3?

54:45.181 --> 54:46.549
[cheering]

54:47.884 --> 54:50.553
-[Tiki] Stomach Churn is next.
-[Chris] Adjusting his bow tie.

54:53.223 --> 54:56.126
[Tiki] The first time through,
he went after this Point Thruster.

54:56.192 --> 54:59.396
Let's see if he goes for it this time.
He's gonna attempt it.

54:59.696 --> 55:02.399
Being a long man,
he should be able to easily.

55:02.465 --> 55:03.867
Yeah, he is. He got it!

55:05.101 --> 55:06.136
[Chris and Tiki] Oh!

55:06.202 --> 55:07.037
[Chris] Nice jump!

55:07.103 --> 55:10.106
[Tiki] Safely at the end of Stomach Churn,
doing a new "Running Man".

55:10.173 --> 55:13.777
[Chris] Remember last time, Gerzik
had his hands on the side and slipped out,

55:13.843 --> 55:15.679
and barely caught the Stomach Churn.

55:15.745 --> 55:18.248
This time, let's see if he learnt
from his mistake.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.417
There he is. See?
Nice technique this time.

55:20.483 --> 55:22.285
[Tiki] Hands on the traction pads.

55:22.352 --> 55:24.788
He flies up the Digestive Track,

55:25.055 --> 55:28.758
which gives him an easy jump
on to the Dreadmills.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.126
[Chris] No problem there.

55:30.193 --> 55:33.563
[Tiki] John Gerzik moving
with deliberation and ease.

55:33.963 --> 55:36.466
On to the second of the Dreadmills,

55:36.533 --> 55:39.269
and one more jump until
he gets a little bit of respite.

55:39.336 --> 55:42.405
John Gerzik is currently tied
with Yiqi Li.

55:43.373 --> 55:48.144
[Chris] If he gets any more points here,
he knocks Yiqi Li out of the competition.

55:50.113 --> 55:52.048
[Tiki] Much better technique this time,

55:52.115 --> 55:54.150
but he skips the Point Thruster.

55:54.217 --> 55:58.355
[Chris] John Gerzik has just killed
the dream of Yiqi Li from China.

55:59.089 --> 56:02.158
That means Yiqi Li is eliminated
from Ultimate Beastmaster.

56:03.159 --> 56:06.363
[Tiki] Oh, there, he almost...
he's so close!

56:06.429 --> 56:09.899
[Chris] Come on, John. We need someone
from the US to finish this level, please!

56:10.800 --> 56:11.634
Come on, come on!

56:11.701 --> 56:14.471
Oh! John Gerzik went for it.

56:14.804 --> 56:17.640
[overlapping commentaries]

56:18.808 --> 56:20.343
John fell.

56:21.010 --> 56:22.846
-John fell into the water.
-He fell.

56:22.912 --> 56:25.515
However, Yiqi Li was also eliminated.
I'm not happy.

56:25.582 --> 56:27.484
OK, now it's Bin Fang's turn.

56:27.550 --> 56:30.920
[Tiki] The US crowd is shocked right now.

56:30.987 --> 56:32.389
[Chris] Oh, man!

56:32.455 --> 56:37.727
Literally, half an inch more, if he'd got
those fingers up over that Vertabrace,

56:37.794 --> 56:39.629
he may have been able to hold on.

56:39.696 --> 56:41.498
[Tiki] God, as I look at this
in retrospect,

56:41.564 --> 56:43.933
I really wish he'd gone
for that Point Thruster.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.702
Man, the Point Thrusters are huge!

56:46.169 --> 56:47.170
Am I safe?

56:47.237 --> 56:48.872
[man 2] You're on the bubble right now.

56:49.973 --> 56:50.907
[Tiki] As you can see,

56:50.974 --> 56:54.077
John Gerzik frustrated
that his run wasn't strong enough

56:54.144 --> 56:56.079
to secure safe passage to Level 3.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.881
[Chris] But our final runner, Bin Fang,

56:57.947 --> 57:00.683
he's got a chance to get
immediate revenge for China.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.152
Revenge Fang.

57:02.552 --> 57:04.788
[Tiki] Bin Fang has 80 points.

57:04.854 --> 57:10.393
There are only 120 points
available on Level 2,

57:10.960 --> 57:12.762
without the Point Thrusters.

57:12.829 --> 57:17.534
So, Bin Fang has to get every
available point in the Beast,

57:17.967 --> 57:21.604
plus at least two Point Thrusters.

57:22.005 --> 57:24.374
[Chris] It's China versus USA once again.

57:24.441 --> 57:29.846
Bin Fang coming out for China, and
John Gerzik is on the bubble right now.

57:30.847 --> 57:32.549
[Qinyi] You can do it, Bin Fang.

57:32.615 --> 57:34.717
You're the best!

57:34.984 --> 57:37.420
Qinyi is waving the flag

57:37.487 --> 57:38.388
to cheer for him.

57:38.455 --> 57:42.258
You can do it, Bin Fang!

57:42.892 --> 57:46.963
[Tiki] He's struggling a little bit
on this last piece of Spinal Ascent.

57:47.030 --> 57:48.631
-[Chris] Come on.
-[Tiki] Oh, stuck!

57:49.499 --> 57:53.837
He's flipping around again,
using his parkour and climbing skills.

57:54.704 --> 57:56.306
But he expended a lot of energy.

57:56.372 --> 57:59.809
-[crowd] You can do it!
-[woman] Bin Fang.

58:00.410 --> 58:02.812
[Tiki] He has to go after this first
Point Thruster.

58:02.879 --> 58:05.048
Will China have two qualified contestants,

58:05.615 --> 58:09.519
or will our Haibin Qu fight alone?

58:09.586 --> 58:12.922
We hope Bin Fang can get all the points.

58:13.356 --> 58:17.827
[Tiki] He has to get every available point
plus two Point Thrusters,

58:17.894 --> 58:20.330
in order to best John Gerzik.

58:20.830 --> 58:23.800
Go for the Point Thruster!

58:23.867 --> 58:25.335
[Chris] Wow, he's not going for it.

58:25.401 --> 58:27.170
-He needs to.
-[Tiki] He's saying, "no."

58:27.237 --> 58:29.772
-Why is he not going for the bonus points?
-Go for it.

58:30.306 --> 58:31.708
You need the bonus points!

58:31.774 --> 58:36.312
Bin Fang, you need the bonus points.
You can't make it without bonus points.

58:36.379 --> 58:39.449
-[Chris] You need the Point Thruster.
-[Tiki] He skips the Thruster.

58:39.516 --> 58:43.119
For some unknown reason,
Bin Fang skips the Point Thruster.

58:45.855 --> 58:49.259
He's not gonna go for the second one,
because it's out of his reach.

58:49.993 --> 58:50.860
Why?

58:51.561 --> 58:52.395
[Tiki] Wow!

58:52.462 --> 58:54.464
What a decision by Bin Fang.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.766
Remember, the first time through Level 2,

58:56.833 --> 58:58.234
he made it to Chain Reaction

58:58.301 --> 59:01.571
but could not keep his momentum
enough to get to the Vertabrace.

59:01.638 --> 59:03.506
Could be in uncharted territory.

59:03.773 --> 59:06.342
[Chris] He's doing it, not me.
I know he knows what he's doing.

59:06.409 --> 59:08.845
But, I would have gone
for the Point Thrusters.

59:08.912 --> 59:11.981
[Tiki] He's conserving energy,
makes the leap onto the Dreadmills.

59:12.048 --> 59:14.651
Didn't think it would be a problem.
Up the second one.

59:14.717 --> 59:17.687
One more jump before
he makes it to Chain Reaction.

59:19.355 --> 59:20.890
[cheering]

59:22.258 --> 59:24.193
[Tiki] Oh, he doesn't make the jump!

59:25.228 --> 59:26.195
[groaning]

59:26.262 --> 59:29.198
[Tiki] What a disappointment for Bin Fang!

59:29.265 --> 59:34.504
And John Gerzik, of the United States,
makes it through to Level 3.

59:34.571 --> 59:35.772
It's the end.

59:36.839 --> 59:41.945
Maybe Bin Fang wasn't well prepared
for this competition.

59:43.313 --> 59:44.180
I feel like...

59:45.615 --> 59:46.683
I'm not in good form.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.152
I don't know what went wrong.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.655
[Tiki] Wow.
Think about the development here.

59:52.722 --> 59:57.360
There were four Chinese competitors at
the beginning of this championship round.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:02.198
Only one - Haibin Qu -
has made it through to Level 3.

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.400
Look how close that leaderboard is.

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:08.471
And there they are -
our final four of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:13.810
[Chris] Team USA repping strong.
I like our odds, Tiki. I like them a lot.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:18.848
[Tiki] The final four of Ultimate
Beastmaster are about to enter Level 3.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.985
And tonight,
it's putting a premium on speed.

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:26.589
The Ejector belt is accelerated,
and the Coil Crawls sink faster.

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.591
Interesting thing to know here.

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:32.362
There are two Americans,
John Gerzik and Kyle Soderman,

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:36.766
going up against Manuel Cornu of France
and Haibin Qu of China.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:42.505
Both Manuel Cornu and Haibin Qu
finished Level 3 in their first attempt.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.674
So they have experience
getting to the end.

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:47.710
John Gerzik and Kyle Soderman did not.

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.813
[Chris] The athletes
wishing each other good luck,

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.751
as American John Gerzik, who's been
a great story from the beginning,

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.719
gets ready to lead off Level 3.

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.989
[Tiki] John has a current score
of 215 points.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.058
That's just 25 off of first.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.394
But he's up against expert climbers

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.430
and needs a strong run
for a shot at the final level.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.365
[Chris] John Gerzik, on to the Ejector.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.535
No problem getting on to Prism Strike.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.470
[Tiki] Will he get the Point Thruster?

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.439
Yes, he does! 10 more points.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.575
This transition has been difficult,
but not for John Gerzik.

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.277
The American is beasting so far.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.580
[Chris] On to Coil Crawl here,
he can get 15 points if he completes it,

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.716
but remember that thing is sinking.

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:29.519
[Tiki] John Gerzik making quick work
of this first Coil Crawl.

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:32.522
It's important to go quickly,
because if you don't,

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.624
it's hard to get in high
onto the next one.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.492
-Yes.
-His feet are already wet.

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.995
Thinking about that
Point Thruster, he taps it.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:41.698
Both Point Thrusters so far
for John Gerzik.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.901
-[crowd] USA!
-[woman] USA!

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:49.238
[Tiki] He started 35 points
behind the leader, Haibin Qu.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.908
He's shortened that gap
just a little bit,

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:54.310
because he's got two
Point Thrusters already.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:58.081
Can he get through this last one
quick enough to take a shot at Hangman?

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.384
-Come on, Johnny!
-You've got to have composure.

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:05.888
It looks like he's there,
he's got his hand on it.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:11.928
It's really important to do well,
because half of the points available...

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:16.332
in Level 3 are right here on Hangman.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.068
[Chris] Come on, John!

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.971
[Tiki] John Gerzik,
you see him trying to employ

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:24.841
that figure four technique
that a lot of the climbers use.

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.677
[chanting] USA!

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.921
You've got this, don't give up!

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:49.198
[Tiki] Now, John's at a disadvantage
because he did not complete Level 3.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:54.370
Haibin Qu and Manuel Cornu,
both did complete Level 3.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.705
He loses his grip!

01:02:56.506 --> 01:03:00.810
John finishes Level 3 with 285 points.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:04.013
Will it hold up?
We'll have to wait and see.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.181
[John] I'm happy with it.

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:08.618
I got a Point Thruster that I don't think
a lot of people are gonna get.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:11.687
So I think that will give me an advantage.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.823
That is a hard obstacle, Hangman.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.625
I didn't get as far as I wanted to get.

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:16.626
But you know what?

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:20.029
It's time to wait and see how
everyone else stands up against me.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:24.167
One of our great American stories
is John Gerzik, for sure.

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:27.036
[Chris] Physics teacher back in Texas,
his students love him.

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.237
The US loves him.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.740
The only person that doesn't love him -
the Beast.

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.109
[cheering]

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.979
[Tiki] OK, here's the first threat
to John Gerzik.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:39.816
The "Rudy" story
of this championship round.

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:43.953
Gritting through some pain
in Level 3 with 230 points,

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.322
Manuel Cornu of France.

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:49.192
-No, the French guy!
-Manu Cornu!

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:53.029
The only French guy still in the
competition. We know him very well.

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.965
He has very weird hair,
and his surname is Cornu.

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.434
[klaxon sounds]

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:03.039
[Chris] Cornu steps up to the Ejector
which is now going 17 miles an hour.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.175
[Tiki] Lands the first handheld
on Prism Strike.

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.847
-Go! Ten extra points.
-Get your hand out.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:14.050
[Tiki] Can he make the transition
to the second handheld? Pretty easy.

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:19.856
Now he'll use his climbing skills,
to hopefully fly through the Coil Crawl.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.059
-Go, Manu! Faster!
-Go faster!

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.695
Go, Manu! You have to go faster!

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:31.467
[Tiki] Let's see if he takes a shot
at this second Point Thruster.

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.603
[crowd chanting]

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:36.839
[Tiki] In his first run through Level 3,

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.576
he hit all the Point Thrusters
except for that one, and he skips it.

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.545
Because speed is of the essence.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:46.115
Those Coil Crawls are sinking
into the fuel of the Pyramid.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.286
[crowd applauding]

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.657
[Chris] He has leopard print on his head
but he climbs like a monkey.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:55.591
[Tiki] He does!

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:59.161
He gets to the third and final Coil Crawl.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.797
But he's on the bottom of it,
he's got to hurry if he...

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:02.732
[Chris] Come on!

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:05.801
-[Tiki] ...wants to take a shot.
-[Chris] Take a dip in the Prism oil.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:11.107
-Come on, big guy!
-I feel like he's going to make it.

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:13.175
-Go, Manu!
-Go, Manu!

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:16.913
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu with a knee injury,
but at this point...

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.147
[Chris] ...doesn't matter.

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:23.019
[Tiki] It has no consequence, as the rest
of the course is all upper body strength.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:27.657
And because he's such an expert
climber and boulderer,

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:30.893
he dominated this his first time through.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.930
Manuel Cornu pulls into the lead.

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:37.500
[Chris] Jesus, look at this kid
fly through this now.

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:41.704
[Tiki] He's got a very effective technique
moving through Hangman.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.341
-[Chris] He got another Point Thruster.
-[Tiki] He did, he got the Point Thruster.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.509
[Manuel yells]

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.410
[Chris sighs]

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:48.978
[Chris] Gerzik will be out.

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.280
-Damn it.
-[Tiki] Not looking good for John Gerzik.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.215
[crowd applauding]

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.585
[Tiki] He's got a lot of effort
to go through.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:59.789
As you can see, it depends
on which way your triangle is facing...

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.625
-[Chris] Oh!
-[Tiki] ...if you wanna get to the next.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.693
[Chris] Wow.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.094
[Tiki] Shaking his arms out,

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:07.596
as best as possible.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.832
Trying to get some life back into them.

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.435
[Chris] Unbelievable strength, right here.

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:15.538
-Look at that, doing it like an armpit.
-[Tiki] Not a bad technique.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:18.541
[Chris] Wow.
Get your armpits like Vince Carter.

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.177
Go, Manu! Look at that!

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:24.714
-All the others...
-A technique we haven't seen.

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.950
All the other competitors
did the opposite.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.721
[Tiki] Now he can just hang out and rest.
He's got four minutes left.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:37.626
A very smart, tactical climb here
by Manuel Cornu,

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.862
as he's resting
before he takes on Pipeline.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:44.667
[crowd] Manu! Manu! Manu!

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.969
[Chris] Dude, honestly I told you,
I keep saying this,

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:49.872
at first I hated him for his hair
colored like an animal,

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.208
but now this kid's proven
he's just an animal.

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:56.178
[Tiki] Yes, he is, and he goes over
and kicks the last Point Thruster.

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:57.313
[Chris] Oh, my goodness.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.248
[Tiki] Like the first time he ran through.

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:01.050
[Chris] I genuinely cannot believe this.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.953
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu finishes Level 3.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.756
[Sandy cheering]

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.026
[chanting] Come on, the blues!

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:13.796
What can we say? A round of applause!

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.799
That's amazing!

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.969
This guy deserves an applause,
just to him.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:24.707
[Tiki] 140 points he got on Level 3,

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:28.844
bringing his total to 370 points.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.481
Go! Go! Go!

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.884
[Gilles] Oh, my goodness!

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:40.289
[Manuel] The problem is, the more
you do it, the more lactic acid builds up.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.291
It's hard to fight against that.

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:46.429
But that's often what makes a difference,
isn't it?

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:47.863
It's all in the head.

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:51.333
I gave it my all.

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.603
[Chris] Tiki,
that is one of the greatest single runs

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.639
we've ever seen on Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:59.508
Manuel Cornu is all heart.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:03.045
And check out that leaderboard.
Now he's got one hand in the final.

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:06.382
[Tiki] He absolutely does Chris,
but can he survive the challenges

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:10.453
to come from Haibin Qu
and America's Kyle Soderman?

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:15.057
Haibin Qu comes in to Level 3
with 240 points.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:18.661
As Haibin Qu gets set,
John Gerzik is on the bubble.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:25.067
I think all of them will lose to me.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.770
[Chris] Wow, Tiki.
That's straight up cocky.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.537
Haibin is the best.

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:30.639
You can do it!

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:35.611
[Chris] Haibin Qu
stepping up on to the Ejector,

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:38.147
to Qu himself on to Prism Strike.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.515
Haibin, you can do it!

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.551
[Tiki] John Gerzik is on the bubble.

01:08:43.618 --> 01:08:47.423
As Haibin Qu makes his way
to the Coil Crawl.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.428
[Chris] If he makes it to Hangman,
John Gerzik is going home, man.

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.996
Haibin, you can do it!

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:57.666
-[Tiki] He's flying through Coil Crawl.
-[Chris] This kid is unbelievable.

01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:00.736
[Tiki] Looks like he might attempt
to go for the next Point Thruster.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.304
No, he doesn't, he forgoes it.

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.841
-Monster, move forward.
-It's like his hands are motorized.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.676
He's climbing so quickly.

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:12.581
[Tiki] It's smart for him
to forget about that Point Thruster.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:16.318
Because you've got to get to the end
before these Coil Crawls

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.654
dip into the fuel of the Beast,

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.090
to give yourself a chance at Hangman.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:24.493
[Chris] Hangman in Level 3
is where you really rack up the points.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:28.296
[Tiki] 75 available points on Hangman.

01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:29.832
Plus a Point Thruster.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:35.304
[Chris] He is now tied with John Gerzik.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:38.541
[Tiki] He had no problem with this
the last time.

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:40.943
And with that transition...

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:45.113
John Gerzik has been knocked out
of the competition.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:48.751
[Chris] We salute you, John.
Great job representing our country.

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:51.453
OK, John is eliminated.

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.925
[audience cheering]

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.729
[Tiki] Slowly and methodically,

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:04.967
moving his way, triangle to triangle.

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:08.170
[Chris] He was, like,
built to do this course.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:12.141
[Tiki] Grabbing the next triangle whilst
simultaneously hitting the Point Thruster.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.909
-[Chris] Jeez.
-He's my favorite.

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:15.377
Let's keep in mind,

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:20.482
that my first citizenship is Italian,
but my second one is Chinese.

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:27.723
[Tiki] Making his way to Pipeline,
he's not even breathing hard.

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.925
I feel that watching him compete

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:33.128
is like watching a Tai Chi performance.

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:36.165
[Tiki] Strong hands,
great climbing ability.

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.367
Solidly.

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:43.572
[chanting] Haibin, you can do it!

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:46.742
[Chris] If he makes it to the top,
this is gonna put him five points ahead

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:49.545
of the current leader, Manuel Cornu.

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:52.348
[Tiki] He hits with his foot
and then with his hand,

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.250
the last Point Thruster.

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:55.651
[Chris] No sign of slowing down.

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.820
-[Tiki] He gets to the top.
-[Bin Gu] Here he comes.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:11:03.158
[Tiki] Haibin Qu
has put himself into Level 4.

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:07.563
Nicely done!

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.366
Congratulations to him!
And he was so quick.

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:11.767
Nicely done.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:16.438
-Congratulations!
-He's a real warrior!

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:19.541
-Wow, very good work!
-That was great!

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:23.612
[Tiki] 380 points for Haibin Qu of China.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.680
[Chris] Wow!

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:31.353
[Haibin] I really want everyone
to feel my power and energy.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.956
I feel like I'm on top form tonight,

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:39.395
so I'm really looking forward
to the championship battle.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.699
[cheering]

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.770
[Tiki] Kyle Soderman does
mathematically have a chance,

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.839
but he's got to have a near perfect run.

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.409
He is 135 points

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:57.913
behind the second place challenger now,
Manuel Cornu of France.

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:02.084
-We feel like we still have a chance.
-Mathematically on paper.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.754
-That's what we said, guys!
-Kyle Soderman has to be perfect, almost.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.556
-140 points.
-If he misses...

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.492
But he's our most perfect participant.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.562
[Chris] If anybody is gonna do it
for America, it's Kyle.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.464
He's our everything, our ace.

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:18.300
He's our Roger Clemens.
He's our Teddy Roosevelt.

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:22.237
He's our Bruce Jenner.
It's Kyle Soderman.

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:26.375
Now all the pressure
is on the American contestant,

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:27.443
Kyle.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:29.812
[Chris] Here he goes.

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.016
Easily onto Prism Strike from Ejector.

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:38.120
-[Tiki] He gets the Point Thruster there.
-[Chris] Needed that.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:39.688
[Tiki] So he stays perfect.

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.590
-[Chris] No mistakes.
-[Tiki] No mistakes.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.025
He goes through to Coil Crawl.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.960
[Chris] He has to go
for that Point Thruster.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.863
[Tiki] He doesn't necessarily have
to go for this Point Thruster.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.298
[Chris] But he should if he could.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.134
[Tiki] The last time he went through
and hit this Point Thruster,

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:55.504
he barely had time to reach up
and grab Hangman.

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:58.540
-He did get that Point Thruster.
-[Chris] He got it!

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:00.008
He looks determined, right now.

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:02.277
[Tiki] He does look determined
and focused.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:05.180
So far, a perfect run from Kyle Soderman,

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:08.250
but let's remember what he did
the first time through Level 3.

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:12.020
He got the Point Thrusters
on Prism and Coil Crawl,

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:15.591
and he made it to Hangman,
but his grip gave out.

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:20.195
As he goes through this third Coil Crawl,
as long as he gets here with enough time

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.098
to effectively grab on to Hangman.

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:25.033
[Chris] Which he is going to.

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:29.004
-Got it.
-[Tiki] Now, he's outside of his strength.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.440
[Chris] Kyle Soderman
has to get through Hangman

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.742
to have a chance to pass Manuel Cornu,

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.978
and solidify his place in Level 4.

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:40.082
Even here, Manuel was able
to easily get through this.

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:42.851
For Kyle, it already seems
like it's tough for him.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:45.721
[Tiki] Well, he's actually swaying
his body back and forth.

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:50.893
It's his strategy, but he is not a climber
like the others are climbers.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.629
[Chris] There's Manuel Cornu
cheering on the guy

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:55.364
who could potentially knock him out.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:59.435
-I don't think he understands competition.
-[Tiki] But he understands sportsmanship.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.871
But Kyle has to finish this level.
So, come on Kyle!

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.173
Let's go, man!

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:10.512
He manages to get to the next
of the Hangman triangles.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:15.417
Kyle is gritting this out.
Can he pull it off?

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:19.888
[Tiki] No, he loses his grip!

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.190
[overlapping commentaries]

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:24.159
[Tiki] He's so upset with himself!

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.427
[yells frustratedly]

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:28.764
[growls]

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:32.634
Manu is in the final!
France is in the final!

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.837
France is in the final!

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:38.474
Such a disappointment for Kyle Soderman.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.475
[Chris sighs]

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.109
[Kyle screams]

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.513
[Chris] He's got so much
to be proud of, though.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.982
Him and John Gerzik
anchored our American team.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:50.853
He has nothing to be ashamed of. This is
the hardest obstacle course ever made.

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:52.554
I've been humbled by the course.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.390
It's no joke.

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:58.060
I know I was fighting as hard as I could.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.163
I could have got a couple more,
I know that.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:04.199
I don't know if I could have got
all the way to the top.

01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:07.369
What I do know, though,
is that as soon as I get home,

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:09.771
I'm gonna keep on training.

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:13.275
I'm gonna keep on working harder
for the next time I come.

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:17.846
Because next time I come, I'm gonna
come back and be the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:21.383
I'm gonna come back better,
I'm gonna come back stronger.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.288
You've got to feel for Kyle Soderman.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:30.092
[Tiki] Our final two have been determined.

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:34.096
Manuel Cornu will take on Haibin Qu

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.899
when they go on to Level 4,

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:40.702
for a chance to win $50,000

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:43.505
and claim the title
of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.576
-Woo!
-Woo!

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:51.480
[Gilles] Woo!

01:15:54.816 --> 01:15:58.086
[Tiki] Here we are,
Level 4 of the championship round

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.656
of the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.724
It all comes down to this.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.594
We started with 108 competitors,

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.462
now it's the final two.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.965
Climber versus climber.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:15.971
Haibin Qu finished Levels 1, 2 and 3
tonight in impressive, dominating style.

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.339
Nicely done!

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:21.109
[Chris] Manuel Cornu nearly completed
Level 1 this evening,

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:24.046
but he picked up a brutal injury
on the last hurdle.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.315
-[Sandy] He hurt himself!
-[Gilles] He's hurt...

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:30.819
[Chris] Still, he managed to gut out
thrilling finishes on Levels 2 and 3.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.821
[chanting] Come on, the blues!

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:36.625
[Tiki] The first time they tackled the
Beast, they both summited Level 4.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:40.395
They have separated themselves
as the two greatest competitors.

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:43.265
But only one will become
Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.470
The Chinese guy is a bit ahead of me.
I'll have to take risks.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:51.206
At this last stage,

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:54.042
I'll prove to the world
that I am the strongest.

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:56.645
[Manuel] I'm going to try and show
my strength from the start,

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:57.713
so...

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:01.717
so that he will get behind,
see me in front, panic, and mess up.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.752
I'll be the Beastmaster.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:04.686
It will be me.

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:10.292
[Tiki] The other 106 athletes who competed
this season are all up close and ready

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.927
to watch this epic showdown.

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:16.098
It's happening! Here we are!
As you can hear, there's loads of noise.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:18.367
-Lots of emotions!
-We've left our booth...

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:21.703
for this grand final -
the final of the finals.

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.939
Let's go, Manu! We're all supporting you.

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.474
You were our champion

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:27.075
from the word go.

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:30.979
This is China's glory. This is our glory!

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:33.115
Let's all cheer for Haibin.

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:36.151
[Tiki] 380 points for Haibin Qu
on the left.

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.820
Manuel Cornu with 370 points.

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:41.256
-Go, Manu!
-Go, France!

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:45.794
-[crowd] You can do it!
-[Qinyi and Bin Gu] Haibin Qu!

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:49.931
-[Gilles] Manu is off! He's on Full Tilt.
-[Sandy] They are neck and neck.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:50.966
[Tiki] It's close.

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:55.037
And because of the ultimate Point Thruster
at the top, a 200 point Point Thruster,

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:57.239
whoever gets there first
is likely to win.

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.207
[Chris] Strategy here
is just get to the top.

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:01.209
If you get the 200 points
it doesn't matter.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.812
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu
gets the first Point Thruster.

01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:06.715
-[Sandy] He got it!
-[Gilles] Come on, let's go now!

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:09.217
-10 extra points! They are tied now.
-10 points!

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:13.121
[Qinyi and Bin Gu] Haibin, you can do it.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:14.690
[Sandy] Go, Manu!

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.958
[Tiki] Now both of these competitors
are climbers,

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:18.860
so this is right in their element.

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.962
But unlike the first time
they ran Level 4,

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.898
they're rushing up the Motherboard.

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.599
[Gilles] France is behind you, Manu!

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.335
He really needs to go faster.

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:30.772
[Tiki] The second Point Thruster
goes to Manuel Cornu.

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.441
He is now in the lead.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:36.044
[Chris] Manuel Cornu has got a pretty good
lead. I didn't expect this at all.

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:39.648
-[Tiki] Two minutes and 30 seconds.
-[Chris] On to Sky Hook.

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:42.918
Haibin Qu, first one to get out there.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.587
Haibin Qu
is starting to catch up with Manu.

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:49.091
[Chris] Haibin Qu,
literally flying through Sky Hook.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.393
Haibin, you can do it!

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.628
-He needs to be careful.
-You can do it!

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:56.198
[crowd cheering]

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.867
[Tiki] Haibin Qu is there.

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:01.269
Manuel Cornu got hung up a little bit.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.571
Go, Manu!

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.974
[Chris] Haibin Qu
trying to get up the Ventilator.

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:08.910
[Tiki] And there he is.

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:12.047
[man 3] Go on, Manu!

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:16.451
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu heading up the
Ventilator, and trying to catch Haibin Qu.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:18.920
[Chris] Wow, Haibin Qu

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:23.425
really, really pushing hard
to get to the top.

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.061
-[Bin Gu] Nicely done.
-[Qinyi] You're close to winning this.

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:27.996
-[Bin Gu] You can win.
-[Qinyi] You can do it.

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.632
You can do it, China! You can do it!

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.534
Haibin got the bonus points!

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.036
Both of them are on the Ventilator.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:37.672
A few seconds will make
all the difference.

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.341
[Tiki] Who can get to the top first?

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.010
Keep going, big guy!

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:46.014
-Haibin's going up.
-[Sandy] Go, Manu!

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.616
[Bin Gu] He's quicker.

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.484
[Gilles] Go, Manu!

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:52.053
-[Bin Gu] He's quicker.
-[Qinyi] You can do it, Haibin.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.422
[Bin Gu] He did it!

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:57.025
[Chris] And he's got it! He's there first!

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:01.696
Haibin Qu is the Ultimate Beastmaster!

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.499
-He's from China!
-He's the best!

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.201
[groaning]

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.872
[Tiki] Manuel Cornu is trying to finish
for pride's sake.

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:14.176
Champion!

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:19.214
[Tiki] And Manuel Cornu bowing down
in respect for Haibin Qu.

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:22.017
What an amazing run by these two athletes.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.186
[Chris] That was literally amazing.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.656
[rapturous cheering]

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:30.959
[Tiki] Setting the bar high
for all future competitors.

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:35.030
Haibin Qu is our first ever
Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.333
Thank you so much.

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:39.768
Thanks, thanks.

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.405
[Tiki] Sportsmanship at its best.

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:48.176
As Team China comes
and celebrates with Haibin Qu.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.612
[Chris] Don't drop that guy,
he's worth $50,000.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.147
Who knows what that is in yuan.

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.815
You're crying, Qinyi.

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:55.617
Thank you.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.085
It was incredible.

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:01.790
[Chris] And the French athletes
are so proud of Manuel Cornu.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.492
[Tiki] Yeah, he's their champion,
no matter what.

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.362
[cheering]

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:12.000
Haibin! Haibin!

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:14.436
-Haibin!
-He's the best!

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.104
Haibin!

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:19.908
I'm the best among the elites
from the six different countries.

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.476
I'm the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:26.581
[Chris] What I love about this competition

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:29.084
is there's so much in the world
that tears us apart,

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.419
but Ultimate Beastmaster
brings us together.

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.255
[Tiki] From all of us, we want to say,

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:35.023
it was an honor and a privilege

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.926
to be joined
by all the hosts and competitors

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:41.062
from China, France,
Italy, India and Spain.

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.632
Thank you all. Goodnight.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.234
[cheering]

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.504
[the Beast growls]
