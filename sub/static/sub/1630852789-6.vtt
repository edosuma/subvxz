WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:06.080
Gold location number 22. One's at
Tilbury oil rigs on the water now.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.080
Seek out the middle drum. You'll
find three chains.

00:10.120 --> 00:14.760
One is Russian and the other two...
Here we go.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.200
George, pull it up.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.840
HE EXHALES DEEPLY

00:26.880 --> 00:28.400
Put it down, George.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.360
It looks like Billy flopped it
first.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.480
Whoever killed him must have shored
the gold.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.880
Maybe we should listen to the rest
of the tape, see if there's clues.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.400
Fred, I can't stand listening to
that man's dulcet tones any more.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.360
I mean, what accent is that? Posh
Cockney.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.000
I assumed he was disguising his
voice, guv. I don't think anyone
speaks like that.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.960
Fuck knows what people are capable
of these days, Fred.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.640
Why don't we shake everything up a
bit?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.320
Go on, I'm listening.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.320
The Metropolitan Police have today
offered a substantial reward

01:02.360 --> 01:04.800
for any information on the
whereabouts of the gold bullion

01:04.840 --> 01:07.440
stolen in the now infamous Newham
warehouse robbery.

01:07.480 --> 01:12.440
Once the Old Bill had offered a
reward for the gold, it felt like a
noose tightening round out necks.

01:12.480 --> 01:18.240
We needed a way out but we were all
being watched and followed 24/7 by
police surveillance.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.280
So it was impossible to see what
that way out was.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.440
Mick and Phil were the only ones
that weren't being kept track of.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.480
So Mick was tasked with digging up
all the gold.

01:28.520 --> 01:32.320
But Mick had problems of his own
with Ma McTavish breathing down his
neck

01:32.360 --> 01:34.440
demanding half of the loot.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.040
We felt trapped. We needed to get
out.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.920
I've got a bit of work for you.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.920
What sort of work? The kind of work
that someone gets what they deserve.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.840
Phil and Sidney. Get someone good on
it.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.520
Fucking thing.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.040
What about bald George? Who's bald
George?

02:38.080 --> 02:39.640
Used to be called Ginger George.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.240
Big fella. Rides a motorbike.

02:43.280 --> 02:47.320
Why's he not called Ginger George
any more? He went bald.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.240
Fair enough.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.880
Cannae help but notice you've not
got the gold.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.720
No.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.800
And I can't give you no gold.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.600
Oh, now it's getting interesting.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.240
Just my tape recorder.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.760
I record things on here on account
that I have no short term memory

04:00.800 --> 04:05.120
with getting punched in the head so
many times and... What's your point,
Mick Neville?

04:05.160 --> 04:07.920
My point is that I have a new
favourite tape.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.880
This one here, you're gonna love it.
Have a little listen.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.640
MUSIC PLAYS
No.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.760
That wasn't it. Pretend you didn't
hear that, please.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.800
MUSIC PLAYS
No, that's not it either. Sorry.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.520
Just give me two seconds. Two secs.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.480
Bear with me.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.960
RECORDING PLAYS

04:44.000 --> 04:46.040
Mr English has been terminated.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.760
You killed him?

04:51.760 --> 04:55.200
You sure he's dead? He's dead dead
or? How do you know that?

04:55.240 --> 04:58.360
Cos my boy Percy shot him in the
back of the heed.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.480
Now, you cross us, and that's the
McTavish way.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.600
That's you that is. You and me
talking.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.720
Why would I let you walk out of here
with that tape?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.560
You think I'm stupid? Do you?

05:17.040 --> 05:18.240
There's copies of this tape.

05:19.600 --> 05:25.600
Anything happens to me or my pals, I
will make sure the said copies

05:25.640 --> 05:29.400
are given to every police officer in
London.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.920
That's not realistic.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.800
Yes, that would be quite a feat,
wouldn't it? I might've shot my bolt
a little bit there.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.000
On recalculation, I shall make
sure...

05:43.320 --> 05:50.920
..that 12 to 14 of these tapes are
handed out to the biggest
gossipmongers in the police force.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.480
And they hear what you've done and
then your days are numbered.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.040
All of yours are.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.800
You keep me and my gold out your
mouth, all right?

06:00.840 --> 06:04.280
From now on, I don't want to hear
talk about it.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.520
I've said my piece. I'll be on my
way.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.360
That's Mick out, I'm gone. Goodbye.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.560
Oh, big man.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.760
That gold will curse you for the
rest of your life.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.080
Curse? What are you, a witch?

06:24.080 --> 06:27.200
You need to lighten up, love. Crack
a window in here, it stinks.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.480
Good day.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.680
They still there?

06:39.480 --> 06:42.200
Urgh. I'm so sorry, Tash.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.600
This is all my fault. So sorry for
getting us involved in all this.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.600
You only got involved cos I told you
to. Bless you.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.280
It's nice of you to say that but
it's not true.

06:51.320 --> 06:55.160
We all know the person who should be
most sorry is me because...

06:56.280 --> 06:57.720
..the whole thing was my idea.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.080
Was it though?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.920
HE SCOFFS
Yes.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.040
Sort of take the...it was my job.

07:11.160 --> 07:16.880
So, yes, you may have chipped in
with a little idea at the beginning,

07:16.920 --> 07:22.000
"What if you were to rob the place?"
but that was...I was calling the
shots at that time.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.840
I was in control. I was telling you
exactly what to so, Sidney. Yes.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.680
And I made the decision to do what
you said.

07:29.720 --> 07:34.200
I was the one who... Sorry, Sidney.
Sorry, sorry. Tash, what's going on?

07:38.440 --> 07:41.680
The whole thing was my idea.

07:45.080 --> 07:50.560
No. No, cos I have ideas. I had all
the ideas for the thing.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.920
And that was my thoughts at the
time.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.600
I had my own thoughts that I wanted
to do it.

07:55.640 --> 08:00.080
I wanted to do it because I would
talk to you and you'd tell me...

08:01.040 --> 08:04.640
..and then you'd...you made me think
that.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.280
You made me do it.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.640
Did I want to do it? I'm sorry,
Albert. I wanted things to be better
for us, for the kids.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.400
OK.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.800
ALBERT GRUMBLES
Give me a sec.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.840
OK, that's fine. Is it though? I'm
going to speak to my wife. Tash.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.280
I'm not a man that raises his voice
very often.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.240
And I'm not about to start today.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.160
But I'll tell you what man I am.

08:40.160 --> 08:43.760
I'm a man who's going to get us out
of this mess. I'm Albert Fantoni.

08:45.280 --> 08:50.200
A man of dignity and class that
sticks by my family no matter what
happens.

08:59.920 --> 09:05.480
Great plan. They're all phoning,
nutters after a chat and a few bob.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.400
Spoken to about 15 old people
wanting to know what's going on.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.600
They read it on Rental, the lot of
them.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.640
Guv. Guv!

09:15.160 --> 09:18.960
They've specifically asked for you.
Did they give a name? No.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.840
What's going on Albert?

09:34.920 --> 09:35.960
What's all this about?

09:37.480 --> 09:39.840
Er, there's a...I heard there's a
reward.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.880
All of the country knows that.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.080
Why don't you tell me what you know?

09:47.080 --> 09:49.240
Then we can talk about any readies
after that.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.400
I'm not built for this. Of course
you're not, Albert.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.600
You don't have the arsehole for this
sort of thing. Look at you. Yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.880
I know where the gold is.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.280
How do you know that?

10:17.880 --> 10:20.880
Tash don't know I'm here. If she
finds out, she'll kill me.

10:20.920 --> 10:25.080
I'm doing this for the kids. I'm
doing it to save us. Al, Albert.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.480
You're doing the right thing.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.960
If I tell you, will you please
promise that...

10:38.640 --> 10:42.200
..nothing will happen to the kids or
Tash and they'll get the reward.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.800
You have my word.

10:48.600 --> 10:53.560
But what I need from you right now,
Albert, is to tell me where is the
gold?

10:59.800 --> 11:01.800
SIRENS BLARE

11:21.320 --> 11:23.360
Get back, get back. I'm in the
front!

11:23.400 --> 11:24.880
Fred, follow me.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.360
Oh, yeah.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.320
Take it off. Take it off.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.640
Wait, wait! No-one touch the gold.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.040
Albert had pulled off a master
stroke.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.080
Keep coming, Nigel.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.440
The previous morning, he got Phil to
load all the gold under the bonnets
of old bangers.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.280
And a decoy he fed Saunders allowed
us all to make our getaway.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.800
There he is. Jump in the back, I've
got a blanket for you to hide under.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.480
No, I'm driving. I'm the driver.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.800
Not today. Word from the top, you've
got to stay concealed, hidden.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.040
Andrew is at the wheel.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.800
What you talking about?

12:35.840 --> 12:41.040
How's the gold? Let's just say there
are some very expensive cars on
their way to Spain right now.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.920
And the gold's inside them?

12:47.960 --> 12:50.920
Yeah, obviously, that's what I mean.
That's why they're expensive.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.760
Right, Sidney, we've got to be there
for eight, so better get a move on.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.520
Say no more.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.480
I can feel how slow you're going.
Oh, there she is.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.200
Just getting the biting point.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.200
It's more dangerous to drive slowly
than it is to break the speed limit,
that's a fact.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.840
Philip, don't tell me how to drive
my car, please.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.240
Whole place is totally cleared out.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.760
Something's going on. We need to
find out where they're going.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.120
Can't let them get away.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.040
Fuck's sake. You had him, why'd you
let him go?

13:46.040 --> 13:48.560
We needed the gold. You fucked it,
we had him.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.760
Don't you talk to me like that.

13:50.800 --> 13:55.200
Albert's a good man. He's caught up
in something he doesn't understand.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.960
He played you like a mug.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.360
They've been playing us this whole
time. I told you. I fucking knew it.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.240
We just needed a bit of Donald, that
was all. Donald?

14:05.240 --> 14:07.400
It's not about luck, it's about good
police work.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.280
I'm sorry I got in the way of your
good police work.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.680
Good luck with it all, I'm done
here. You sort it.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.160
Fuck!

14:29.800 --> 14:34.640
All right, you grab him. I'll have
the car ready. Yeah. Listen. Well
done, Albert.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.400
You are amazing. Yeah, you should've
seen me out there.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.360
I had tears in my eyes and
everything.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.360
So fucking sexy. Yeah. What? Crying?
You don't find crying sexy?

14:43.400 --> 14:47.400
No, not the crying. All right. You
pulling this off. Oh, right.

14:47.440 --> 14:52.120
You're like a new man. Definitely.
Yeah. I like it. Yeah?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.360
See you later, baby. What?

15:06.000 --> 15:09.160
I was just saying see you later,
baby. Turn the music down.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.440
I was just saying see you later,
baby. But probably not the
right...the moment's gone.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.920
All right. Bye. See ya.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.280
HE EXHALES DEEPLY

15:22.280 --> 15:24.960
Hi. Hiya. Are you ready?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.480
Er, nearly. They're in the bath. In
the bath?

15:28.520 --> 15:30.680
Girls, get out. Get ready, we've got
to go.

15:32.800 --> 15:33.800
What's the rush?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.440
I've just made some tea.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.280
Right, yeah, no. Cheers, Cand.

15:46.080 --> 15:50.680
Oh, yeah. Is everything OK, Tash?
Mm-hm, yep.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.400
Good, actually. Yeah.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.240
Albert's downstairs waiting in the
car. You said we could talk.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.640
Yeah, we can. We used to tell each
other everything.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.400
We do. We talk. Well, talk to me
then.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
I know.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.880
I know something is going on.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.760
All right. I know things have been
weird, but...

16:18.800 --> 16:20.880
..I promise I'm going to tell you
everything

16:20.920 --> 16:23.520
as soon as I can, you've got to
trust me.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.000
You haven't spoken to me in so long,
Tash.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.360
I didn't know what to do. I know
I've been shit but honestly it was
to protect you.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.760
It was just to protect you, I swear
I'm gonna figure it all out

16:33.800 --> 16:36.240
and everything's going to be all
right for everyone.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.720
You've got to understand that you're
my best friend and I love you.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.640
Run!

16:50.640 --> 16:53.360
What? You need to go now.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.000
What have you done? I'm so sorry.
They're coming here.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.080
Girls, girls, you've got to get out
right now. We've got to go. Oh, my
god, Tash.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.920
We're still gonna be...
BOTH SCREAM

17:03.960 --> 17:07.800
Are we still gonna be friends?
Candice, I don't have time for this
right now.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.200
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Argh!
I've got to run.

17:11.240 --> 17:15.440
I'm so sorry. It was a lot for you.
Argh! Argh! OK, I'm going.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.760
You look after yourself, Cand. You
too. You look after yourself.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.320
Come on, come on, let's go.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.240
Come on, girls. Come on, come on.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.240
Quick, quick. In you get.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.040
Seat belts on, please. Good girls.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.360
Quick, let's go.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.440
What you doing? Ten to two.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.320
You know the limit's 30 down here.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.560
You're going 10. 10. I'm taking
it...I'm on a suspended sentence.

18:51.600 --> 18:55.680
I'm not gonna go over the speed
limit. We are in a bit of a rush,
Sid.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.080
Thank you.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.560
Time is of the essence, son. So I'd
like a crocodile.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.240
Make it snappy. No problem.

19:34.280 --> 19:38.720
Never resist it up here. It might be
my last for some time.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.200
I shall have me favourite dish. Egg,
bacon and cheese double decker
sandwich.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.760
You got chips? Yes, we do.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.000
I'll have some chips. Rush them
through, if they're hard, don't
matter.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.760
No problem. Would you like the
sandwich toasted?

19:50.800 --> 19:52.680
Erm, will that take longer?

19:52.720 --> 19:55.960
I think it'll still be ready at the
same time as the chips.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.240
So technically it won't delay
anything. Son.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.240
DETECTIVE IMAGINES VOICE

20:27.760 --> 20:30.200
Right, Sid. Pull up over here, I'm
driving.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.400
The roads are dangerously narrow.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.400
Sid, the limit is 60 and you're
going 25.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.560
You know what, fine, I'll pull over
then.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.600
You can have a go. Yeah, I will.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.160
Someone's better at driving. Sid,
that's what I do.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.800
Phil!

21:01.440 --> 21:02.880
You fucking bastard.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.920
SID SCREAMS AND FIRES GUN

21:15.760 --> 21:16.760
Phil?

21:18.280 --> 21:19.280
Phil!

21:20.640 --> 21:22.600
Please stay. Fucking hell.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.640
It's going to be fun. Climb up.
Right in there.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.520
They said they'd be here at eight. I
told them eight. Get a wiggle on,
kid.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.120
Want to get this baby in the air.
Yeah, definitely.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.040
Really appreciate you doing this as
well. That's what friends are for.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.960
I scratch your back and when mine's
itchy...

21:50.960 --> 21:52.000
..I scratch yours.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.400
Here they are. They're here. Thank
fuck.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.200
Who's this? Phil and Andrew.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.680
Why's he on his own? Where's Phil?

22:02.240 --> 22:05.360
We need to go now. Where's Phil? We
need to go now.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.560
The got him. There was a geezer on a
motorbike.

22:08.600 --> 22:13.800
He got out, he came at us. Phil said
I was driving like a fanny.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.120
He come out, he had a gun. Where's
Phil? Where's Phil? What's happened?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.520
What do you mean? Phil's...Phil's
dead.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.880
What do you mean? They got him.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.720
POLICE SIRENS

22:38.160 --> 22:39.200
For goodness' sake.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.640
Fucking car.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.120
Take this fucker down.

22:53.120 --> 22:56.120
It's Mick, he's here. Fuck, it's the
police.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.960
Pull the fuck in!

23:12.920 --> 23:14.280
Go there! Cut him off.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.880
I'll break through.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.480
Oh, fuck!

23:33.160 --> 23:35.840
I just hope they can wait. I just
hope so.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.840
Mick, run!

23:43.480 --> 23:45.520
Oh, Mick, run. We're gonna have to
go.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.320
Got to wait for him, please.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.480
Come on, Mick, run.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.400
Come on! We don't have time.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.560
Mick, please run!

24:05.600 --> 24:06.960
Mick!

24:15.280 --> 24:16.560
Hold on!

24:18.120 --> 24:23.600
Get him! Get him! You let the
fuckers win. I'll get you, Fantoni!

24:23.640 --> 24:25.160
I'll get you!

24:31.080 --> 24:32.520
Put your hands above your head.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.960
Put your hands above your head!

24:36.280 --> 24:39.800
What I've done now is completely
misjudge the distance.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.720
You're under arrest for armed
robbery.
