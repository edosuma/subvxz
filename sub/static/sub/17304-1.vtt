00:38.207 --> 00:40.958
<i>And now,
some tragic local news.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:43.460
<i>We have a report of another murder tonight.</i>

00:43.502 --> 00:46.672
<i>A young girl has been found dead
in Rogers Park.</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:48.966
<i>The body was badly mutilated.</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:50.175
<i>Because of these murders,</i>

00:50.259 --> 00:54.471
<i>police request that all women stay inside
their homes after dark.</i>

00:54.513 --> 00:57.599
<i>If you must go out,
please have someone accompany you.</i>

00:57.641 --> 01:00.811
<i>Keep your door locked. We'll repeat that.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:05.983
<i>Police request that all women stay inside
their homes after dark,</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:07.776
if you must go out...

04:17.673 --> 04:19.926
Pete, this is the worst yet.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.346
I don't know what to make of it.

04:24.347 --> 04:28.268
Seven killings in two weeks. Young girls.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.521
And each killing more
brutal than the other.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.650
This lab report doesn't mean anything.

04:37.152 --> 04:40.489
We went over that last girl's apartment
with a fine-toothed comb.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.618
The body looked like Jack the Ripper
had got to her.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.039
There should have been clues
all over the place...

04:49.080 --> 04:51.249
And we couldn't come up with one.

04:51.333 --> 04:54.878
Yeah, and the DA's office
is getting hot too, Chief.

04:58.215 --> 05:01.718
Well, we're just working
with a homicidal maniac, that's all.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.846
But there's more to
this than just a maniac...

05:06.056 --> 05:07.516
There is a pattern.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.395
Now, all these bodies
have been badly mutilated,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.065
certain limbs and organs have been removed.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.401
This, er, Pat Tracy
that we found yesterday,

05:19.486 --> 05:21.863
the lab says her heart was cut out.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.242
Gives me the chills just to think of it.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.911
Yeah, the newspapers are really playing
this one up, too.

05:28.411 --> 05:33.291
Well, Frank, this
looks like one of those long, hard ones.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.795
I know what you mean. Oh, Pete...

05:37.838 --> 05:39.923
Call the radio and television stations.

05:40.632 --> 05:44.511
Have them repeat
those emergency broadcasts every half hour.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.765
I wanna make sure every woman in this town
hears those broadcasts.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.103
Well, you better get going.
I've got some reports to go over.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.604
Okay, Chief.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.420
Good day! Are you Mr. Ramses?
I'm Dorothy Fremont.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.423
Er, well...

06:22.007 --> 06:25.093
I heard about you from a friend of mine,
Annette Dupree.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.555
I'm giving a dinner party in two weeks
for my daughter

06:28.638 --> 06:32.976
and Mrs. Dupree said that you cater
to just the type of thing I'm looking for.

06:33.476 --> 06:37.939
I want, er, something unusual,
something totally different.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.693
Yes, Mrs. Fremont,

06:41.776 --> 06:45.906
I do cater to unusual affairs.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.618
What do you consider to be unusual?

06:50.368 --> 06:54.080
Oh, I don't know.
What do you recommend?

06:55.332 --> 06:59.336
Have you ever had an Egyptian feast?

07:00.170 --> 07:03.506
Why, that would be fine!
That would be perfect!

07:03.590 --> 07:07.469
My daughter Suzette is a student
of Egyptian culture.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.555
Mr. Ramses, she'd just love it!

07:10.639 --> 07:12.307
An Egyptian feast!

07:13.266 --> 07:16.603
Yes, an authentic dinner,

07:17.395 --> 07:21.650
such as one might have attended
in Ancient Egypt.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.696
The actual feast of an ancient pharaoh.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.699
It has not been served

07:30.033 --> 07:34.371
for 5,000 years.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.501
Yes.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.045
Yes.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.048
We must do it.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.556
Mrs. Fremont...

07:53.598 --> 07:57.560
I am honored that you are requesting
my services.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.899
You see, this type of affair
is my specialty.

08:04.109 --> 08:08.822
So, you see, I shall cook
your daughter's dinner for you.

08:08.905 --> 08:12.450
Oh, that will be wonderful!
Now, I'm depending on you.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.246
I want Suzette to have a party
that will be the talk of the town.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.249
Every dish must be authentic.

08:19.290 --> 08:23.128
It's a surprise for Suzette and
I do want it to be successful.

08:23.962 --> 08:28.675
Your dinner will indeed
be a success, Mrs. Fremont.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.885
I promise you.

08:31.970 --> 08:36.640
Things will be arranged
just as the feast of the goddess

08:36.725 --> 08:40.562
was given 5,000 years ago.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.983
Erm, "goddess", Mr. Ramses?
I don't think I understand.

08:45.066 --> 08:50.864
I only meant that I will arrange things
to suit your taste, Mrs. Fremont.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.784
Oh, well, that's fine,
then I can leave everything in your hands.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.121
Now, this is my card.
The name and address are right there.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.624
I'm mailing out invitations
for two weeks from Saturday night.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.252
You can have things ready by then?

09:04.294 --> 09:08.882
Things have been ready
for a long time, Mrs. Fremont.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.550
A long time.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.219
- Er, I beg your pardon?
- Er...

09:13.720 --> 09:17.640
Er, oh, well, then. Good day, Mr. Ramses.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.935
Two weeks from Saturday night.
Er, 6:30 sharp.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.010
Oh, my Ishtar.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.929
My goddess.

10:38.012 --> 10:41.015
At last, you have signalled me to begin.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.395
Oh, divine and wondrous
one of the veiled light.

10:46.437 --> 10:51.317
At last, Shamash shall visit you
in the feast of your love.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.071
Oh, my goddess,

10:55.113 --> 10:59.242
I am your slave, my lady of the dark moon.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.402
A pathological killer on the loose
and we can't find one clue!

11:35.028 --> 11:40.033
This man's uncanny,
not one fingerprint, nothing!

11:40.617 --> 11:43.036
Did you check
with the girl's neighbors, Pete?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.996
Yeah, Chief, but they heard nothing.

11:45.079 --> 11:49.250
Seems she was a hostess at a restaurant.
Got home every night about 12 o'clock.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.379
Neighbors say she's a quiet girl,
never has any friends over.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.840
Then I went down there
and I spoke to her boss.

11:55.924 --> 12:00.220
She said, er, she has no boyfriend at all
but all the people seem to like her.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.932
And the only thing she seemed
to have an active part in

12:03.973 --> 12:06.434
was a book club she belonged to.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.646
Well, stay on it, Pete.

12:10.647 --> 12:14.317
Look, we have the police for 200 miles
around on this.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.778
Every street is patrolled.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.822
We sure should get
him if he tries it again.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.035
Look, I got to go over to the morgue.
You get to work.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.844
Tony!

12:43.346 --> 12:47.517
It's getting late.
Shouldn't we be getting back?

12:48.768 --> 12:52.522
- Mum will worry about me when it gets dark.
- Relax, hun.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.316
Just a while longer.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.945
Your folks know you're in good hands.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.407
Besides...

13:02.490 --> 13:04.409
This is when it...

13:04.492 --> 13:08.204
- Just starts getting nice.
- I know Tony, but...

13:09.998 --> 13:13.042
Well, I feel... I feel...

13:13.126 --> 13:14.419
Funny.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.755
All those murders and everything
around here?

13:17.839 --> 13:20.883
Hey, baby, I'm here.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.887
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.558
You're my girl, aren't you?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.687
Besides...

13:32.729 --> 13:34.397
It's still early.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.817
Look, we'll go when it gets dark.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.236
I promise.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.781
Now, prove you love me.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.092
Tony!

15:30.388 --> 15:32.640
She wanted to leave!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.685
She was scared!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.938
It's all my fault!

15:40.106 --> 15:43.484
I... I made her stay!

15:44.861 --> 15:48.865
- It's... It's all my fault!
- Take it easy, Tony.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.536
Try to tell us who did it. You must try.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.125
- Try to tell us, Tony.
- No! No, sir!

16:00.126 --> 16:02.753
I can't remember!

16:04.005 --> 16:06.883
Everything happened so fast!

16:13.181 --> 16:14.640
And then I got her...

16:15.391 --> 16:19.854
I can't remember! I can't remember!

16:19.896 --> 16:21.355
Take it easy, son.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.942
Sergeant, take this boy to the hospital.

16:25.026 --> 16:28.070
We will want to talk to you later, Tony,
when you've calmed down.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.246
Say, what do you make
of these murders, Frank?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.041
He always kills the same way.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.419
He just takes one part of the body.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.923
This time, he took the brains.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.093
Now, what kind of a creature would do that?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.429
Pathological killer.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.265
Sick, sick mind.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.938
Well, we've gotta notify the parents.
I don't look forward to that.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.443
You check on the boy,
find out anything he can remember.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.613
All right, let's get this poor
girl's body down to the morgue.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.907
Officer, go get a
stretcher, will you, please?

17:33.469 --> 17:34.804
Mrs. Franklin...

17:36.222 --> 17:38.975
Have you any idea who could've done this?

17:39.559 --> 17:43.104
She was so young! So very young.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.774
Oh, Arthur, why would anyone do this
to our daughter?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.236
Try to control yourself, Molly.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.656
Marcy was a good girl.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.117
She'd want us to help the police.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.912
We've got to do whatever we can,
so that no innocent girls are murdered.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.212
Would you like a glass
of water, Mrs. Franklin?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.333
Yes...

18:10.089 --> 18:13.759
Mr. Franklin, tell me about your daughter.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.013
Who were her friends?

18:17.054 --> 18:20.016
Did she ever date anyone besides Tony?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.769
Marcy wasn't much of a gadabout.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.939
She went steady with Tony...

18:28.649 --> 18:30.651
For over a year.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.489
She had lots of friends,
everyone liked her.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.784
No one would do this to my Marcy!

18:39.785 --> 18:42.330
No one who knew her!

18:48.711 --> 18:52.840
Did you daughter belong to any
organizations, clubs, anything like that?

18:54.884 --> 18:57.303
No, she had lots of friends.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.058
She didn't belong to
any one particular group.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.020
She did have her name on a book club list.

19:06.437 --> 19:09.732
Book club list? When?
What do you mean, "book club list"?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.943
She was going to graduate from high school
this June.

19:13.027 --> 19:16.030
I made her a dress, a white dress.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.450
And now she'll never wear it,
she'll never wear it!

19:19.533 --> 19:21.118
Please, Molly, please!

19:21.869 --> 19:23.871
I've give you a list of her friends' names.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.875
We'll do anything. Anything
at all to help you find this killer.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.419
Easy, Molly, take it easy.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.601
Oh, it's nearly ready.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.312
Nearly ready.

19:49.522 --> 19:54.443
The ancient formula
needed for your rebirth.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.250
Now, we shall have the flavor.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.293
The special flavor...

20:12.461 --> 20:17.466
Seasoned just right for you,
oh, mother of the veiled darkness.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.149
No! No! No!

23:24.194 --> 23:25.946
No...

24:25.214 --> 24:26.799
Oh, Suzette dear!

24:26.882 --> 24:30.219
Well, things are finally underway
for your party.

24:30.260 --> 24:34.890
The caterer has a marvelous idea,
I can hardly wait. Aren't you excited?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.935
Yes, Mother! Of course I am!

24:39.853 --> 24:42.606
Only, I was reading about all those murders

24:43.315 --> 24:45.901
and it sort of takes all the joy
out of everything.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.405
It's all so strange.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.742
I mean, the police not finding any clues
or anything.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.370
It's terrible!

24:57.204 --> 25:01.125
I just shudder when I think
about that butcher...

25:01.208 --> 25:04.086
That maniac, butchering all those girls.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.382
I wish they could find out who did it
and put him where he belongs.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.635
I won't feel safe until they do.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.972
Oh, it is horrible, but,
Suzette don't be silly.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.182
I'm sure the police
will find him real soon.

25:17.933 --> 25:22.438
Anyway, the dinner party Saturday will take
our minds off all this horrible killing.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.232
Suzette, it will be a wonderful surprise!

25:25.774 --> 25:29.361
I'm sure it will be, Mother,
and I can hardly wait!

25:30.404 --> 25:31.947
Well, I better get going.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.242
Tonight is the weekly lecture
on ancient history.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.079
We're learning about cults
of the Egyptian gods.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.540
Did you say Egyptian gods?

25:42.124 --> 25:45.961
- Well, that's a coincidence.
- What kind of a coincidence, Mother?

25:46.420 --> 25:50.049
Oh, well, there's that nicest
little man, he... Oh, well...

25:50.924 --> 25:52.760
Call me when you're ready to come home.

25:52.801 --> 25:57.222
I don't want you out on the streets at night.
Not with all this terrible killing going on.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.101
Yes, I will, Mother. Bye, see you later.

26:19.411 --> 26:23.207
Hello? Helen? Dorothy Fremont.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.878
You are coming to Suzette's party?
Oh, wonderful!

26:28.295 --> 26:30.672
I have a fantastic treat planned.

26:30.756 --> 26:35.844
Oh, well, I found a perfectly delightful
caterer who has a marvelous idea.

26:35.886 --> 26:39.014
Who? His name is Fuad Ramses.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.810
Ramses I
and Ramses II were pharaohs.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.729
It was Ramses ll

26:45.813 --> 26:50.234
whose soldiers were drowned in the Red Sea
while chasing Moses and the Israelites.

26:51.235 --> 26:56.073
Now, our mutual interest
in the cults of Ancient Egypt,

26:56.156 --> 26:59.034
takes us tonight to the cult of Ishtar,

26:59.118 --> 27:03.997
a goddess who was worshipped
by the early Egyptian and Assyrian peoples

27:04.039 --> 27:06.583
more than 5,000 years ago.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.377
The worship of Ishtar

27:08.460 --> 27:12.131
or the 'mother of the veiled darkness'
as she was sometimes called,

27:12.214 --> 27:15.634
was one of the most bloodthirsty religions
ever known.

27:16.426 --> 27:20.722
Though she was worshipped as the goddess
of love and beauty

27:20.806 --> 27:25.018
such as Venus or Aphrodite
of the Greek and Roman civilizations,

27:25.602 --> 27:29.773
hers was an evil love
that thrived on violence.

27:31.066 --> 27:35.195
And the festival of Ishtar was celebrated
at the beginning of spring

27:35.237 --> 27:40.075
when life again was given to the land
from the swollen body of the Nile River.

27:41.243 --> 27:46.832
The temple of Ishtar stood high on a hill
overlooking the city of Antioch.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.752
The goddess was served by 20 beautiful,
young virgin girls.

27:51.253 --> 27:55.299
Shamash was Ishtar’s high priest and lover.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.887
He was worshipped as a lesser god,
by the men of the city.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.015
On the eve of the feast of Ishtar,

28:03.098 --> 28:06.101
the people of the city crowded
around the temple.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.770
Here, for six wild days and nights,

28:09.146 --> 28:12.441
the young priestesses would mingle
with the men of the city

28:12.482 --> 28:15.485
and lust would reign over the land.

28:15.569 --> 28:20.574
On the seventh day, the crowd would gather
at the temple for the great feast,

28:21.158 --> 28:24.703
a blood feast that would give the goddess
to the people.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.749
The young priestesses would be slaughtered
on the great altar.

28:28.790 --> 28:33.462
Their blood would be caught in silver bowls
as it ran from their bodies.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.341
Then certain organs and limbs
would be removed,

28:37.424 --> 28:40.219
and prepared as dishes to serve the people.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.514
As the last morsel
of this horrible feast was eaten,

28:44.973 --> 28:49.102
the high priestess would show herself
rising from the tomb.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.314
A living incarnation of Ishtar.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.318
Ishtar arisen in flesh and blood,

28:56.818 --> 28:58.654
and become part of the people.

29:42.364 --> 29:47.327
This custom of the blood feast existed
for more than 400 years

29:47.369 --> 29:53.208
and was finally abolished by Amenhotep ll,
of the 15th dynasty.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.253
It is said that even today,

29:56.336 --> 29:59.673
there are still followers
of this gruesome goddess.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.426
However, it has never been proven.

30:02.509 --> 30:06.388
And this concludes my lecture
on Ancient Egyptian cult.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.224
I hope to see you all again here next week.

30:14.688 --> 30:15.689
Thank you, sir.

30:17.232 --> 30:21.403
- Thank you. I'm very glad you enjoyed.
- Oh, I certainly did.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.126
- We like you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.075
Thank you. Appreciate it.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.414
Thank you.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.750
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, sir.

30:38.086 --> 30:43.342
Oh, how could a race of people
actually follow such a vile cult?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.303
Well, the ancients
had many strange cults, honey.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.723
You know, an idea based on blood lust,

30:49.765 --> 30:53.393
well, that could spread quickly
in a civilization founded on superstition.

30:54.603 --> 30:59.441
Yes, I can see what you mean.
But to actually eat human flesh...

31:00.150 --> 31:01.651
Pete, how could they?

31:01.735 --> 31:04.946
Oh, come on, honey, let's talk
about something more pleasant.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.740
Like, for example, you and me?

31:06.782 --> 31:09.326
You're coming to my party Saturday night,
aren't you?

31:10.619 --> 31:12.496
I'm counting on your being my date.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.831
I wouldn't miss it.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.460
Say, I understand, your mother went all out
on this one, even for her.

31:18.543 --> 31:22.089
But I will try and make it
if I'm not tied up on a case.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.966
You know,
with all these grisly murders going on,

31:25.050 --> 31:27.219
I'm on 24-hour call.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.389
Pete, what do you make
of all these murders?

31:30.472 --> 31:31.973
Isn't there any clue at all?

31:32.557 --> 31:34.643
No, not so far.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.230
You know we have every man on the force
working double duty?

31:39.189 --> 31:41.858
But nothing's broken so far.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.319
Although, young... Young Tony Parker?

31:44.361 --> 31:46.488
The boy who was with the girl killed
on the beach.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.698
Now, he did give us one clue.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.784
He said that though everything
happened so quickly,

31:50.826 --> 31:55.288
he got a glimpse of gray hair
and strange glowing eyes.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.959
And it seems to be an older man
that we're looking for.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.546
I kinda got one clue on my own, it's, er...

32:03.171 --> 32:06.675
I can't seem to make it fit, though.
It's about a book...

32:08.093 --> 32:10.929
But I can't...
I can't make out the significance of it.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.682
I feel safer with you working on it, Pete.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.644
And now I'd better call Mother
for a ride home.

32:17.727 --> 32:21.857
- She gets frantic when I'm out late at night.
- Say, how about me giving you a lift?

32:22.274 --> 32:25.068
You know the mad killer wouldn't bother you
being with a policeman.

32:25.152 --> 32:29.448
- And, don't worry, it's not a police car.
- I'm not hinting, that would be great.

32:30.157 --> 32:32.242
- Just let me call Mother first.
- Okay.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.434
Let's stop for a minute
honey, huh?

32:58.268 --> 33:02.564
I... I don't know. Do you think it's safe?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.984
You know on second thought

33:06.067 --> 33:08.862
you might be safer with the killer
than you are with me?

33:08.904 --> 33:13.825
Pete! Don't make a joke of it.
You know I'm not afraid of you.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.996
And it is such a lovely night.

33:19.039 --> 33:23.084
- Why not? But just for a little while.
- Okay.

33:28.757 --> 33:29.758
You know...

33:30.967 --> 33:33.970
This is the first pleasant evening
I've had since that first murder.

33:34.930 --> 33:38.934
I'm just gonna sit back, relax.

33:40.685 --> 33:41.686
Say...

33:42.687 --> 33:45.774
Do you know now that I've got you all
to myself all alone,

33:45.815 --> 33:50.278
I don't know what to do with you,
but I got an idea or two.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.657
Easy, Mr. Officer.

33:54.115 --> 33:58.453
You're supposed to keep law and order,
not break it.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.415
Even though you are pretty nice.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.961
You know something,
you're pretty nice yourself.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.047
Say, Suzette, er...

34:09.965 --> 34:12.926
Well, ever since we started
these Egyptian culture classes,

34:14.094 --> 34:16.638
well, I've wanted to say something to you.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.848
You have, Pete? What is it?

34:20.641 --> 34:23.103
Well...

34:24.228 --> 34:27.649
I don't know. I guess I'm a better
policeman than I am a public speaker.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.571
Then don't speak, Pete.

34:43.164 --> 34:46.668
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you a news bulletin.</i>

34:46.710 --> 34:49.420
<i>Another victim of the recent wave
of brutal attacks</i>

34:49.504 --> 34:51.255
<i>has been found near-death.</i>

34:52.340 --> 34:57.846
<i>Police say the victim is a young girl, about
23. Identity has not yet been established.</i>

34:58.513 --> 35:00.849
<i>The girl's condition
is described as critical.</i>

35:00.932 --> 35:03.578
I better get going, honey,
they might need me down at the station.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.353
Oh, Pete!

35:17.198 --> 35:19.242
Well that's it. The whole story.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.580
Found this girl on a deserted street
on the outskirts of town.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.916
She was just about gone
but we did get her to a hospital.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.211
The whole side of her face was hacked away.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.297
Pete, if she can identify her attacker,

35:32.380 --> 35:34.633
this just might be the break
we've been waiting for.

35:34.716 --> 35:37.177
Well, then let's get over there, pronto.

35:44.768 --> 35:49.564
Thank you, nurse, that will be all.
Doctor, we've done all we can.

35:49.898 --> 35:50.899
Thank you.

35:52.192 --> 35:55.487
You... Can only stay a few minutes,
there's isn't much time.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.365
Doctor, is there any chance at all?

35:59.407 --> 36:00.408
Not a chance.

36:01.701 --> 36:04.162
This is one of the most brutal cases
I've ever seen.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.917
Her face was hacked away, clear to
the bone, her eyes were gouged out.

36:10.710 --> 36:14.255
She's lost a great deal of blood
and she's in severe shock.

36:17.258 --> 36:21.554
- It's a terrible thing. Such a young girl, too.
- Has anyone notified her folks?

36:21.971 --> 36:24.557
So far, we don't know who she is.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.269
There was no identification on her
when the police brought her in.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.273
Your missing person counter is checking.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.776
I'll let you know when we get a report.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.569
Can we talk to her?

36:37.278 --> 36:39.118
You can try,
but please make it short.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.329
Miss? Can you hear me, miss?

36:50.083 --> 36:53.044
Can you hear me? We're police officers.

36:53.586 --> 36:54.587
We need your help.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.382
Yes...

36:58.883 --> 37:00.593
I can hear you.

37:01.511 --> 37:02.804
What's your name?

37:05.974 --> 37:07.392
Janet

37:08.977 --> 37:12.355
Janet... Blake.

37:13.481 --> 37:17.652
Who did this to you, Janet?
What did the person look like?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.156
Wild eyes!

37:22.741 --> 37:24.659
He had...

37:24.701 --> 37:26.703
wild eyes!

37:28.705 --> 37:31.374
I was walking...

37:32.500 --> 37:34.544
He came from...

37:34.627 --> 37:36.755
behind a bush.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.175
Horrible old man!

37:41.217 --> 37:44.220
He said it was for

37:44.304 --> 37:46.347
"Itar."

37:46.389 --> 37:49.184
"Itar."

37:49.726 --> 37:50.727
Doctor!

38:08.244 --> 38:09.996
I'm afraid it's all over.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.382
She never had a chance, poor kid.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.887
An old man with wild eyes.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.932
Well, at least it's something.

38:29.891 --> 38:31.559
What do you make of it, Pete?

38:31.935 --> 38:34.437
What do you think she meant by "Itar"?

38:35.271 --> 38:36.272
I don't know.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.692
Could be somebody's name.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.404
Strange, though...

38:44.030 --> 38:45.907
It almost sounds familiar.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.915
Well, the killer must've thought she
was dead. It's a miracle she wasn't.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.418
Well, she is now.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.921
Yeah.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.259
Well, okay, let's go make a report,

39:04.342 --> 39:06.928
and every man over 40
with any kind of a record

39:07.011 --> 39:10.139
gets picked up for questioning.
We might come up with something.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.060
I pray to God we do.

40:57.705 --> 41:01.834
I would like to speak
to Miss Trudy Sanders, please.

41:04.545 --> 41:08.299
Oh, I see. Er, this is quite urgent.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.053
Er, could you tell me
where she could be reached?

41:14.389 --> 41:19.727
Oh, the Fremont residence.
Er, yes, I have the number.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.814
Yes, thank you very much.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.699
Oh, Ishtar,

41:32.740 --> 41:34.617
mother of the black sun.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.663
Tomorrow, you shall have life.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.084
For I, Ramses...

41:44.752 --> 41:46.337
shall give you life.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.800
Only one more thing do I need

41:52.051 --> 41:54.929
and the formula will be complete.

43:24.852 --> 43:28.231
Gee, I sure am excited
about the party tomorrow night.

43:28.523 --> 43:31.067
I wonder what Mother has planned.

43:31.150 --> 43:35.530
I don't know, but your mum certainly asked
that this year's party be a real treat.

43:36.155 --> 43:41.410
I can hardly wait for this party to start.
Sounds like a real blast.

43:42.703 --> 43:45.623
It's getting late, I better leave.

43:45.706 --> 43:48.417
I wanna finish shopping
before it gets too dark.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.588
It gives me the shivers when I think
of that killer loose somewhere.

43:53.256 --> 43:54.715
I'm gonna get dressed.

43:56.092 --> 43:59.887
Gee, Suzette, do you what type
of party your mother has planned?

44:00.721 --> 44:04.100
Well, I'm not sure but
I think I have an idea.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.395
I'm not supposed to know anything about it.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.439
I think it's gonna be an Egyptian feast.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.025
- Egyptian feast?
- Yes!?

44:13.067 --> 44:17.238
Well, you know, Mum knows how interested
I've been in Egyptian culture

44:17.321 --> 44:19.407
and how I've been going
to lectures every week.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.242
Doesn't that sound exciting?

45:17.548 --> 45:22.011
That's right. Trudy Sanders.
She's been missing since last night.

45:22.094 --> 45:23.971
Now look, I want an all-city alarm,

45:24.055 --> 45:26.307
and I want to know
the moment you hear anything.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.977
- I can only hope it's not the killer.
- Yeah.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.105
You know Trudy is a good friend
of Suzette Fremont's.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.858
She said she left her house
about 7:30 last night.

45:36.817 --> 45:40.404
- And she never got home, did she?
- Yes, it looks bad,

45:41.405 --> 45:43.532
but we're doing everything
we can to find her.

45:44.325 --> 45:46.452
Look, I'm going down and checking
on the suspects

45:46.494 --> 45:48.454
that the boys brought in this morning.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.831
- Keep me posted, Pete.
- Will do.

46:13.771 --> 46:16.983
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Suzette, please.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.025
Sure.

46:19.986 --> 46:22.280
Hello, Suzette, Pete Thornton.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.824
Yeah, I know, that's why I called.

46:24.865 --> 46:26.575
You know we've been so busy around here

46:26.659 --> 46:28.911
that I completely forgot
about the dinner party.

46:28.995 --> 46:31.195
You know I'll have to be late, honey,
if you don't mind.

46:32.540 --> 46:33.541
Yeah.

46:34.667 --> 46:38.212
No, honey, I'm sorry we haven't
had any word on Trudy as yet.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.718
Yeah, I know you are, but... Well...
Try and enjoy yourself anyway.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.388
Say, just what was the big surprise?

46:48.848 --> 46:52.935
Hey, that sounds great.
Real Egyptian-style stuff, huh?

46:54.228 --> 46:56.939
Who? Fuad Ramses?

46:57.148 --> 46:58.441
No, never heard of him.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.861
Oh, just like Dr. Flanders' speech, huh?

47:03.738 --> 47:04.739
Ishtar?

47:05.406 --> 47:08.951
Well, I hope it isn't exactly
like Flanders described it.

47:09.577 --> 47:12.663
But it does sound like fun and I'll get
there as soon as I can, honey, okay?

47:14.040 --> 47:15.291
Goodbye, then.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.961
Ishtar.

47:55.539 --> 47:59.960
And now, now for the flavors.

48:01.295 --> 48:04.965
The flavor of blood of a young goddess.

48:06.217 --> 48:08.552
Give blood...

48:08.636 --> 48:10.888
to give life to Ishtar.

48:17.311 --> 48:18.771
No!

48:23.025 --> 48:26.404
Stop your screaming!
Stop your screaming, Trudy!

48:27.780 --> 48:29.490
Give yourself up to the goddess!

48:30.157 --> 48:31.158
Give yourself up!

48:38.124 --> 48:41.419
Give yourself up to the goddess!
Give yourself up.

49:38.893 --> 49:39.894
Ishtar...

49:41.479 --> 49:42.480
Itar?

49:44.398 --> 49:46.233
Ishtar. Itar...

49:57.703 --> 50:01.207
Dr. Flanders, this is
Pete Thornton, homicide.

50:01.248 --> 50:05.419
Yes, sir, er, I have a few questions
I'd like you to help me with, sir.

50:06.587 --> 50:08.088
Now you gave a talk last week

50:08.130 --> 50:11.008
on the blood feast of Ishtar,
the Egyptian goddess?

50:12.426 --> 50:14.428
Yes, sir, the festival.

50:14.887 --> 50:17.097
Well, could you tell me
a little bit more about it?

50:24.396 --> 50:27.107
Er, yes, Dr. Flanders,
you've been very helpful, thank you.

50:27.191 --> 50:29.777
And I have just one more question, sir.

50:29.818 --> 50:33.739
Have you ever heard of a man
called Fuad Ramses?

50:33.781 --> 50:35.783
He runs a catering service.

50:37.451 --> 50:38.452
Oh.

50:39.537 --> 50:42.039
Ancient Weird Religious Rites, huh?

50:43.207 --> 50:44.250
Yeah...

50:45.626 --> 50:47.628
We found a copy of that at the...

50:47.670 --> 50:51.131
No, never mind, sir.
Thank you, Doctor, thank you very much.

50:56.428 --> 50:58.806
Yeah, Lieutenant Thornton.
Listen, alert all cars,

50:58.889 --> 51:03.936
send them to the vicinity of 45th and
Lincoln, place called Ramses' Catering.

51:04.186 --> 51:07.690
And listen, get Mason over here fast.
I think we got our killer.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.812
- What is it, Pete?
- Listen, Frank, I got a hunch

52:28.896 --> 52:32.274
and if it proves right, I hope you've
got a strong stomach. Come on.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.205
Come on, Frank, maybe in the back.

52:56.465 --> 53:00.552
What in the name of all that's holy
is that?

53:02.346 --> 53:05.933
That's Ishtar, Frank,
the goddess of love.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.687
Find the light, Frank.

53:23.659 --> 53:27.121
If I'm not mistaken, Frank,
that's Trudy Sanders.

54:11.749 --> 54:12.750
Frank...

54:13.834 --> 54:17.171
If I'm right, these are the leftovers

54:17.921 --> 54:20.674
from the preparation
for the feast of Ishtar.

54:21.133 --> 54:23.010
That's a blood feast.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.888
They take all their young girls...

54:28.891 --> 54:32.644
- And they cook 'em to satisfy their gods.
- Oh, no...

54:36.982 --> 54:40.360
Holy smoke, Frank!
We gotta get over to the Fremont house!

54:40.444 --> 54:44.990
They're having a dinner party tonight,
and Fuad Ramses is the caterer.

54:45.532 --> 54:48.327
Fuad Ramses? Well, let's get going.

54:48.368 --> 54:51.497
Roberts, Nicholson,
Harris, get on that phone,

54:52.247 --> 54:55.542
call the Fremonts. For Pete's
sake, tell them not to eat anything.

54:56.627 --> 55:00.047
Oh, and try not to make Ramses
suspicious until we get there.

55:15.521 --> 55:17.731
Operator?

55:18.023 --> 55:19.066
Good evening.

55:31.954 --> 55:36.124
Come on, Nancy,
Mr. Ramses is about to serve.

55:36.917 --> 55:41.463
It's my boyfriend calling long-distance.
I had him, now we're out off.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.131
I have to wait.

55:43.757 --> 55:46.593
Oh, here's our Mr. Ramses now.

55:46.635 --> 55:50.055
Oh, Mrs. Fremont, a joyous occasion.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.684
And now, I must alert your guests.

55:57.563 --> 56:01.024
The feast of Ishtar is about to begin.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.611
But...

56:06.321 --> 56:09.074
To make the feast more authentic,

56:10.367 --> 56:12.619
I must ask the co-operation

56:14.037 --> 56:17.457
of the young lady in whose honor
the feast is given.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.210
- Who me?
- How exciting!

56:21.795 --> 56:23.964
Yes, Mrs. Fremont, it is exciting.

56:25.048 --> 56:27.676
And now, if the young lady will

56:28.802 --> 56:30.971
accompany me into the kitchen

56:32.556 --> 56:35.392
we will prepare the feast. If you please?

56:36.143 --> 56:41.565
- Oh, I'll bet there never was a party like this.
- Ah, but there was, Mrs. Fremont...

56:43.150 --> 56:45.527
5,000 years ago.

56:46.069 --> 56:48.488
Ooh, 5,000 years ago!

56:58.999 --> 57:00.000
Bill!

57:01.877 --> 57:04.421
Bill? Bill? Are you there?

57:07.799 --> 57:09.426
Where is all the food?

57:09.635 --> 57:13.347
Er, it's in the garage, my dear.

57:13.388 --> 57:16.266
You see, it would be a desecration

57:17.142 --> 57:19.311
to bring it into the house
before you bless it.

57:20.854 --> 57:21.855
Come.

57:23.148 --> 57:24.942
And now, my dear,

57:25.025 --> 57:28.654
I would like you be kind
to the whim of an old man.

57:29.905 --> 57:32.532
As you can see, my dear,
I am an old man.

57:32.866 --> 57:36.203
And I shall never again
have a chance to

57:37.037 --> 57:38.830
offer a feast to Ishtar.

57:39.831 --> 57:42.250
You see, in the ancient days,

57:42.334 --> 57:45.712
it required a young maiden like yourself

57:45.796 --> 57:48.882
to be offered to bless the feast.

57:49.424 --> 57:51.927
How do I do that?

57:53.095 --> 57:56.098
Well, it is necessary, my dear, to, uh...

57:56.181 --> 57:59.059
To lie outstretched on an altar.

57:59.142 --> 58:03.063
Uh, I have prepared this table.
This table will do.

58:03.146 --> 58:07.651
Allow me to help you, and then you...
you lie back

58:10.404 --> 58:13.073
with your head here.

58:13.156 --> 58:17.494
And now, my dear,
you must raise your arms

58:17.828 --> 58:19.246
to the heavens

58:20.247 --> 58:23.750
and you say, "Oh, Ishtar.

58:24.084 --> 58:25.919
"Take me unto yourself."

58:27.129 --> 58:30.674
And your eyes must be tightly closed.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.343
Is that all?

58:33.427 --> 58:36.471
Yes, my dear, that is all.

58:36.555 --> 58:40.517
And you will make
the heart of an old man glad.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.521
Like this?

58:44.771 --> 58:46.023
This is fun.

58:47.024 --> 58:49.651
Dr. Flanders said something in his lecture.

58:51.778 --> 58:56.491
Hey! You wouldn't sacrifice me
on this altar, would you?

58:58.076 --> 59:01.079
Of course not, my dear,
of course not.

59:01.246 --> 59:02.247
Lie down.

59:10.088 --> 59:15.218
And now, my dear,
you must repeat the sacred words.

59:16.762 --> 59:19.264
Oh, I've forgotten them.

59:19.306 --> 59:22.142
I will repeat them for you.

59:22.225 --> 59:24.811
First you must close your eyes.

59:25.187 --> 59:27.314
Then you say,

59:28.231 --> 59:30.525
"Oh, Ishtar,

59:31.151 --> 59:33.320
"take me unto yourself."

59:34.654 --> 59:35.864
And your...

59:37.365 --> 59:39.326
Eyes must be tightly closed.

59:41.870 --> 59:45.040
Oh, my Ishtar...

59:46.333 --> 59:48.335
This is silly.

59:48.835 --> 59:52.964
Oh, my dear. Please, do not
break the heart of an old man.

59:53.048 --> 59:54.925
Your guests are waiting.

59:55.175 --> 59:58.678
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I'll do it.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.350
Oh, my Ishtar...

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.728
Your eyes must be tightly closed,

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:09.689
so that the image of Ishtar is before you.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:14.653
Oh, my Ishtar,

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.782
take me unto yourself.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.743
Now, oh, Ishtar,

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.621
the feast has begun.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.391
Oh, Mr. Ramses,
I must say the guests are getting...

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:17.257
Suzette? Suzette! Suzette!
Mrs. Fremont! Are you okay, honey?

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.593
Oh, come here. Come here.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.222
Oh, Petey.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.516
If it... If it weren't
for Mother coming in...

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.935
What's this all... What's this all about?

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.479
Ramses is the killer
we've been looking for.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:37.068
Mrs. Fremont, I'm afraid this
feast is evidence of murder.

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:39.070
Oh, dear.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.948
The guests will have to eat hamburgers
for dinner tonight.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.659
Did your
men catch him as he ran out?

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:47.329
No, but we will.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.956
We have to.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.794
Suzette, look honey.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:56.755
I'm afraid I got some
very bad news for you.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.131
Now, listen.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.966
We found Trudy.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:02.802
And I'm afraid she was
another victim of Ramses.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.515
Oh, Pete!

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:10.477
Oh, how horrible!

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:14.064
Oh, I pray that they catch him
before it's too late.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.275
Oh, poor Trudy!

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:20.195
Oh, poor Trudy!

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.493
Try and get some rest. Huh?

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:29.037
Lay down and get some rest, honey,
and then when I get back

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.665
we'll have other things to talk
about, okay, honey?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.251
Okay, Pete, let's go get him!

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:35.752
Please, hon.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.193
Frank, stop the truck!

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.292
Stop!

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:43.922
Hey, what's happened?
You guys run into trouble?

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.475
What happened?

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.644
You don't know it, buddy,

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.981
but you just did this town
the biggest service it's ever had.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:06.736
Sergeant, notify headquarters
that the killer

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:09.197
is no more.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:12.784
He died a fitting death,

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.661
like the garbage he was.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.706
Pete, how in the world
did you figure this out anyway?

01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:21.628
Well, Frank,

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.045
I kept remembering the name 'ltar'.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:26.756
You know the name that girl gave us
before she died?

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.300
Well, Suzette Fremont told me
that her mother

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:32.178
had planned a real Egyptian feast
as a surprise for her.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.223
And you know what a bug
I am on Egyptian culture.

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:37.350
Dr. Flanders gave a talk

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:40.019
on the ancient Egyptian goddess
Ishtar last week.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.066
The names 'ltar' and 'Ishtar'
were so similar that I got a hunch.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:48.862
And then Suzette told me that a Fuad Ramses

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:50.613
was catering the affair.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.699
So I called Dr. Flanders

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:55.452
and asked him more
about the blood festival of Ishtar.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.371
He said he knew of Fuad Ramses
who had

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:01.499
written a book called the
Ancient Weird Religious Rites.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.418
And then I remembered,

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:06.713
the book we found next to the body
of the girl who was killed in the bathtub,

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.423
it's the same book.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:12.010
Obviously this man kept a list
of the people who wrote for this book.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:14.929
So, Frank?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.684
Who knows if the spell
of this monstrous goddess

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.478
has possessed anyone else?

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.689
Lust, murder,

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.692
food for an ancient goddess
who received life

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.694
through the perverted
death of others.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.284
Let's go home, Frank.
