WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[opening theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.386
[man] Hey!

00:24.482 --> 00:26.484
If we're gonna
catch up to the Archdruidess,

00:26.568 --> 00:28.027
we'll need our best horses.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.863
Or some really fast cows.

00:29.946 --> 00:30.822
[Zøg babbling]

00:30.905 --> 00:32.157
Oh, no. Dad!

00:33.199 --> 00:34.325
[indistinct chatter]

00:34.951 --> 00:37.871
Kiddo, I would love
to have you as one of my exes,

00:37.954 --> 00:41.666
but I think it's best
if you think of me as your slutty grandma.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.460
I would be honored.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.295
-[kisses]
-[Zøg continues babbling]

00:47.505 --> 00:50.925
Okay, everybody! Move along.
Haven't you seen a honking king before?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.470
Elfo, don't wander off.
We're outta here in 30 seconds.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.096
[Elfo] Hmm.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.765
Hey! Wedding's cancelled.

00:56.848 --> 01:00.310
The reception's that way.
The faster you run, the more beer you get.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.187
[crowd clamoring]

01:02.270 --> 01:03.438
[Zøg groans]

01:03.521 --> 01:05.356
[suspenseful music playing]

01:13.239 --> 01:14.491
Mmm.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.825
[groaning]

01:17.410 --> 01:18.620
[babbling]

01:21.164 --> 01:23.583
Dad, are you gonna be okay?
I gotta go now.

01:23.666 --> 01:28.421
I got Pendergast to look after me.
Maybe we'll go bowling.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.883
Hey, sorry for how things turned out.
But thanks for saving me.

01:31.966 --> 01:32.926
[babbling]

01:33.009 --> 01:35.178
It's the least
I could do after killing you.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.518
-Ooh! Lookie, a black kitty-cat.
-I told you, I'm not a cat!

01:41.601 --> 01:44.521
Luci, I need you to stay here
and take care of my dad.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.899
What? No!
No way in hell. I'm not doin' it.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.236
You can't make me. Not a chance. [purring]

01:52.195 --> 01:53.655
[moans]

01:54.280 --> 01:56.574
Don't even think about it.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.785
Ah, okay, fine.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.829
Would you mind wiping off my drool?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.330
[engine revs]

02:02.413 --> 02:03.748
Look what I found!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.378
-What? But I thought…
-You thought wrong.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.630
[brakes screeching]

02:19.430 --> 02:20.682
[engine revving]

02:33.403 --> 02:35.113
[grunts] What are you doin', you?

02:35.196 --> 02:37.740
[Elfo] Wait there! We'll be right back!

02:38.324 --> 02:41.995
I'm never riding a horse again!
This is the height of luxury.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.454
[bugs splattering]

02:43.538 --> 02:44.372
Yeah!

02:53.256 --> 02:54.632
Are we on the right path?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.467
-[faintly] Seconds from now--
-What?

02:56.551 --> 02:58.761
-[faintly] Seconds from now--
-What?

02:58.845 --> 03:03.016
[loudly] I said, "Seconds from now,
take a sharp right turn!"

03:03.099 --> 03:04.309
[both scream]

03:13.776 --> 03:15.153
[Elfo screams]

03:19.616 --> 03:20.700
Are you okay, Elfo?

03:20.783 --> 03:23.036
Yes, but I can never have children now.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.495
[faint laughter]

03:25.204 --> 03:26.205
Hey!

03:26.289 --> 03:27.665
[laughter continues]

03:29.459 --> 03:33.212
What is that?
A large ape and an unfinished man?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.507
Oh! Princess Tiabeanie
and an unfinished man.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.759
What a surprise!

03:37.842 --> 03:41.721
Old man Malfus! Laughing Horse!
Malfus, maybe you can help us--

03:41.804 --> 03:47.101
[Malfus] It is written on the walls that
you must take this horse on your journey.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.895
You're writing that right now.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.481
Just take the ding-dang horse.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.566
And all his horse porn.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.322
Come on, boy, giddy up. Thanks, Malfus!

03:59.405 --> 04:01.032
[Laughing Horse laughs]

04:01.824 --> 04:04.535
[Malfus] Wait! You took the wrong box!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.290
Elfo, what are you doing? Pay attention!

04:09.374 --> 04:12.752
Oh, sorry, Bean. I'm reading
a really interesting pictorial.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.506
Aw!

04:19.842 --> 04:22.971
And the old man had a candy cane!

04:23.054 --> 04:25.682
-[laughs]
-[Bean groans]

04:25.765 --> 04:28.017
Come on, Bean! This is gold!

04:28.101 --> 04:29.227
[laughs]

04:29.310 --> 04:31.604
Laughing Horse,
you're just encouraging him.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.440
Okay, okay, three elves
walk into a candy bar--

04:34.524 --> 04:35.817
[laughs]

04:36.776 --> 04:39.737
-He even laughs at the setups!
-[sighs heavily]

04:42.824 --> 04:45.034
What kind of weird fog is this?

04:45.118 --> 04:48.162
My hat is drooping
and my shoes are uncurling.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.915
Oh, my God, Bean, I know what happened.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.085
We died when we fell off the cliff.
And now we're in Heaven!

04:54.168 --> 04:56.087
[Bean] Better than Heaven, Elfo.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.132
Welcome to Steamland.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.600
[Bean] Laughing Horse stands out
like a laughing thumb.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.269
We gotta leave him somewhere safe.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.776
Make us some money while we're away!

05:18.860 --> 05:19.819
[laughs]

05:20.528 --> 05:21.988
Giddy up, horsey!

05:22.071 --> 05:23.197
[groans]

05:26.284 --> 05:30.204
-[man 1] What's with the garden gnome?
-[man 2] Hey, lady, your kid's a freak!

05:30.288 --> 05:32.623
We gotta cover up those pointy ears, dude.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.792
I don't think
they get lots of elves around here.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.962
I don't think they get lots of
giant mouse teeth, either.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.174
Sorry, I'm a little damp and cranky.
Look at my shoes.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.259
[Elfo exclaims]

05:46.512 --> 05:47.555
Welcome, gentlemen.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.515
She's not a man, she's a manly lady.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.641
He's not a man, either.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.810
Don't matter to me which what way you are.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.479
It's pitch black in there, anyway.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.897
Go on, little buddy.

05:55.980 --> 06:01.319
And be sure not to grab someone
else's clothes on the way out, okay?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.449
Go!

06:09.118 --> 06:12.705
Oh, look at all these wallets.
People are so trusting.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.166
Ooh!

06:17.168 --> 06:18.002
Hey, Bean!

06:18.086 --> 06:20.088
-What took you so long?
-[grunts]

06:20.171 --> 06:23.591
-Unbelievable.
-Quick, before they get angry!

06:24.175 --> 06:25.426
Stop, thief!

06:25.510 --> 06:27.011
[monkey screeches]

06:28.513 --> 06:29.472
[pants]

06:30.765 --> 06:33.684
-How do I look?
-Like a wealthy potbelly stove.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.894
You think?

06:38.147 --> 06:39.107
[grunts]

06:39.649 --> 06:42.068
This place has a lot of moving parts,
so stick close.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.069
Can I hold your hand?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.654
That won't be necessary.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.905
Where are you going?

06:45.988 --> 06:48.241
-Away, it seems.
-Elfo!

06:48.324 --> 06:50.451
-Excuse me! Pardon me! One side!
-[exclaiming]

06:50.535 --> 06:51.619
-[brakes squealing]
-[man] Ow.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.662
[Archdruidess] Shaddup!

06:52.745 --> 06:55.665
Those were my legs, lady!
You could've used a hand signal!

06:55.748 --> 06:57.333
Hand signal, eh?

06:57.416 --> 06:58.584
Ow! Ow!

06:59.168 --> 07:00.419
[Elfo] Go after her, Bean!

07:00.503 --> 07:02.839
I'm addicted to stealing wallets now.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.260
[panting] Whoa!

07:07.343 --> 07:08.719
[grunting]

07:15.852 --> 07:16.769
Yes!

07:16.853 --> 07:18.187
Ow!

07:22.775 --> 07:24.652
[panting]

07:26.612 --> 07:27.738
Whoa!

07:30.491 --> 07:31.409
Oh!

07:36.747 --> 07:40.585
[man on-screen] Princess Diandra,
we must return the Orb of Splen-dor

07:40.668 --> 07:42.462
lest it destroy the kingdom.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.174
[scoffs] Come on! Who talks that way?

07:46.257 --> 07:50.678
But the Orb also gives life
to Zandoro, my elf companion.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.265
Hello, it is I, Zandoro.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.226
[scoffing] Uh, what? That's an elf?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.603
Hey, pipe down, will ya?

07:58.686 --> 08:01.481
If I wanted to be annoyed,
I'd be home with my family! Shush!

08:01.564 --> 08:04.317
Uh, no, actually, I won't shush!

08:04.400 --> 08:05.318
[sword swishing]

08:05.401 --> 08:09.155
Ugh, and swords don't make a shling
sound every time you wave 'em around.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.907
That's just lazy sound design.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.868
-[sword swishing]
-Ugh, there it goes again.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.245
Shling, shling, shling!

08:16.329 --> 08:18.748
-It's a freakin' shling party. Ugh.
-[audience shushing]

08:18.831 --> 08:19.665
[man] Quiet.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.292
Now they're dancing?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.795
Why do they have scenes
like this that don't move the story along?

08:27.131 --> 08:30.259
-Ow!
-Have some dignity, man! This won't do!

08:30.343 --> 08:31.177
Here.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.930
-Oh! Thank you so much.
-None of it, sir.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.432
Anything for a fellow
LGS member, what-what.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.475
A what-what what?

08:37.558 --> 08:40.311
League of Gallivanting Scrutinators,
of course.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.646
The explorers' club.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.481
[chuckles] What?

08:43.564 --> 08:47.026
Now come along. They stop serving
breakfast cocktails in five minutes.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.415
Your whisky sour, sir.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.168
Mmm, yum.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.878
Next time just bring the sour part.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.755
Less to carry, thank you.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.467
[scoffs] And Bean thought
I couldn't take care of myself.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.220
There I was, trapped on the mountain peak.

09:14.303 --> 09:19.225
On one side, a ferocious yeti.
On the other side, a ferocious bigfoot.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.060
A bigfoot and yeti?

09:21.143 --> 09:23.646
A veritable sandwich of danger.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.231
Whatever did you do?

09:25.314 --> 09:29.235
Why, I introduced them to each other
and officiated at their wedding!

09:29.318 --> 09:33.364
Nine months later,
I was godmother to young Fleebor.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.782
To Fleebor!

09:35.283 --> 09:36.492
[indistinct chatter]

09:37.451 --> 09:39.662
Hey! I've been to Hell.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.622
-[all gasp]
-[monocle splashes]

09:45.126 --> 09:46.085
Hmm.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.672
[panting]

09:55.052 --> 09:56.095
[breathing heavily]

10:00.391 --> 10:01.392
Okay, what is this?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.561
Oh, my God. Calm down.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.939
Oh, no. This is your life now… forever!

10:07.940 --> 10:08.983
[yells]

10:10.026 --> 10:11.152
[laughs]

10:11.235 --> 10:14.071
I defeated your Portal of Many Rotations.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.074
Congratulations.
Just in time for the morning shift.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.451
[siren blowing]

10:22.872 --> 10:23.956
Oh!

10:37.261 --> 10:38.179
Hmm.

10:42.516 --> 10:43.559
[snoring]

10:55.529 --> 10:56.864
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:56.947 --> 11:00.201
Come back here, kitty,
and take a cat nap with me.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.827
[rope winding up]

11:01.911 --> 11:02.995
-[thud]
-[Luci] Ow!

11:04.955 --> 11:06.791
[grunts] Neither of us are cats!

11:07.291 --> 11:10.127
-[grunts]
-See, ain't that nice?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.129
You're my little spoon.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.382
Well, I'm gonna knife you in your throat.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.175
-[grunts]
-What the…

11:16.842 --> 11:17.718
[Zøg screams]

11:21.305 --> 11:23.933
Your Majesty, so nice to have company.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.185
This is usually such a lonely journey.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.900
Now swim for it,
before the crabs swarm over you.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.236
Oh, no.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.201
[buzzing]

11:52.169 --> 11:55.005
You should crank out
a few more before the lunch whistle blows.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.049
A whistle tells you when to eat?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.927
And another for when to work,
and another for when to take breaks,

12:00.010 --> 12:02.012
and another for when to stop daydreaming.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.056
Wow. Whistles control you.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.349
[whistle hoots]

12:06.809 --> 12:08.018
[Bean] Finally! Lunch!

12:08.102 --> 12:10.062
No, they're just testing our product.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.151
[whistle hoots]

12:17.486 --> 12:19.071
That's the lunchtime whistle.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.951
The automat.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.412
Open any glass door
where you see a sandwich.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.333
Don't open the doors which have
bloodshot eyes staring back at you.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.251
Why?

12:32.334 --> 12:33.919
Those are the angry sandwich makers.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.212
Why are they angry?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.672
They get paid in sandwiches.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.056
[Bean] Wow! You can really taste the rage.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.392
Thanks for all this… Um…

12:48.476 --> 12:50.603
Gordy Stewson, happy worker.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.438
I'm… Tia.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.898
Yeah, that's it.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.568
Man, I wish the automat
could give me what I really want.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.029
-And that is?
-Someone who works here.

13:00.112 --> 13:04.283
Evil eyes, holier than thou attitude,
always scheming.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.995
I'm guessing she works in Human Resources.
She looks like this.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.998
That salami could be anyone.

And there, in the middle of the jungle,

26:13.655 --> 26:16.241
he slapped me on the bum-bum.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.325
[all laugh]

26:17.409 --> 26:20.537
Chums, I've had the journey of a lifetime.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.914
I lost ten good men to the frozen north,

26:22.998 --> 26:26.209
but I also lost five jerks,
so it balanced out.

26:26.293 --> 26:30.422
Shush! You're interrupting the most
wondrous tale from our newest member.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.383
Yeah, park it, old-timer.
You might wanna take some notes.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.928
-[all laugh]
-Learn? From you?

26:37.012 --> 26:40.265
Why, I'll have you know,
there's not a single corner of this world

26:40.348 --> 26:43.018
that I haven't explored,
conquered or shot at.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.145
-Oh, think so?
-Indubitably.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.689
Oh, I think can duble it.

26:47.772 --> 26:51.860
Why, the effrontery!
Sir, I lay you a club challenge.

26:51.943 --> 26:55.488
Name a place, any place,
that you have been that I have not.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.157
Elfwood.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.575
-[all gasping]
-What?

26:58.658 --> 27:02.662
A real place, sir.
Not some sojourn of your drunken dreams.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.248
But it is real.
And I've really been there.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.583
Your proof?

27:06.666 --> 27:08.126
-Ta-da!
-[all gasping]

27:09.002 --> 27:10.170
[monocle splashes]

27:11.921 --> 27:14.341
An elf for my shelf.

27:14.424 --> 27:17.344
Bean, I've never met
anyone as bold or clever as you,

27:17.427 --> 27:19.596
so I feel comfortable saying this.

27:19.679 --> 27:23.850
There's a power in Dreamland
beyond anything we have here.

27:23.933 --> 27:28.813
You call it magic, but really, it's simply
natural phenomena we don't yet understand.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.358
But science, or "stience," as you call it,

27:31.441 --> 27:34.486
can harness that magic
into a force for good.

27:34.569 --> 27:38.031
-What exactly are you offering here?
-Definitely not your job back.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.742
You made only
one steam whistle, and this is it.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.744
[whistle hoots poorly]

27:43.703 --> 27:47.832
An alliance is what I'm offering,
between magic and science.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.544
Whoa! This is big. I really need
some time to drink about this.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.921
-You mean--
-I know what I said.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.810
[sighs]

28:09.646 --> 28:11.856
At least Elfo is out there having fun.

28:30.750 --> 28:31.835
[sighs]

28:37.424 --> 28:39.426
[closing theme music playing]
