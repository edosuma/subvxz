WEBVTT

00:09.063 --> 00:10.770
- Da-da-doom.
- Ba-dip ba.

00:11.283 --> 00:11.994
Did everyone have a good break?

00:11.995 --> 00:13.440
Yeah, I discovered
a new back muscle

00:13.441 --> 00:14.500
to work out.

00:14.501 --> 00:17.303
Ladies, you'll thank me
come tank top season.

00:17.304 --> 00:18.656
I checked all of
Pierce's wardrobes

00:18.657 --> 00:20.244
for portals to magical worlds.

00:20.245 --> 00:22.483
All I found was something
called Emmanuelle in Space

00:22.484 --> 00:24.036
on laserdisc...
I couldn't watch it,

00:24.037 --> 00:25.989
but it sounded sexy.

00:26.652 --> 00:27.743
Laserdisc.

00:27.744 --> 00:30.118
I joined a campus volunteer
group that cleans the city.

00:30.119 --> 00:31.316
We picked up litter on the freeway

00:31.317 --> 00:32.398
and dredged the river.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.395
Dredged it for what?

00:33.396 --> 00:34.948
You know, garbage and stuff.

00:34.949 --> 00:37.641
Tires, condoms, needles.

00:37.981 --> 00:39.821
At one point, we found a finger.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.334
Why are you using your
I-love-butterflies voice?

00:42.335 --> 00:43.744
What? Am I?

00:43.745 --> 00:44.560
I don't know.

00:44.561 --> 00:45.645
Volunteer work is nice.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.051
You do nice things.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.076
With nice people.

00:48.077 --> 00:49.852
Ooh.

00:49.853 --> 00:53.315
Somebody's finding river
fingers with a cute boy.

00:53.316 --> 00:55.256
What? No.

00:55.451 --> 00:58.168
Well, okay, yes,
but it doesn't matter.

00:58.169 --> 01:00.377
It's not like I'm seeing anyone.
There's just a guy.

01:00.378 --> 01:02.001
- A guy that goes to Greendale?
- Mm.

01:02.002 --> 01:03.840
Is it the Russian guy that
looks like a short Johnny Depp?

01:03.841 --> 01:05.019
- It doesn't matter.
- Is it the guy who looks

01:05.021 --> 01:06.826
a little like Vince Vaughn
but smells a lot like fish?

01:06.827 --> 01:08.347
I don't want to talk about it.

01:08.348 --> 01:10.091
Well, I have someone in my life

01:10.092 --> 01:11.124
that I'm happy to talk about.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.604
Again with the Jesus.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.096
Well, Jesus is
always in my life,

01:14.097 --> 01:15.932
but things have been
looking better every day

01:15.933 --> 01:17.614
with my ex-husband.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.412
Is it the guy that looks
like Anderson Cooper

01:20.413 --> 01:21.717
but with a soul patch
and the ponytail?

01:21.718 --> 01:23.518
- No.
- Is it black Michael Chiklis?

01:23.519 --> 01:25.068
- No.
- The white George Foreman?

01:25.069 --> 01:26.705
You guys are talking
about the same person.

01:26.706 --> 01:28.412
He's biracial, his name is David,

01:28.413 --> 01:29.436
and he's a human being.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.825
Guys, stop guessing.

01:30.826 --> 01:32.171
It's not a thing at all.
It's just a friend.

01:32.172 --> 01:35.432
- Change the subject.
- Chang the subject.

01:36.673 --> 01:38.654
What are you doing up there?

01:39.548 --> 01:41.936
It's the beginning of a new
semester of Anthropology.

01:41.937 --> 01:43.645
And I'm here to get
what I was promised.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.897
Sure. Who has Chang's
pile of nothing?

01:45.898 --> 01:48.563
- You know what I mean.
- I am sick of the runaround.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.821
I'm here to demand
an immediate answer

01:50.822 --> 01:52.465
about whether I'm
joining the study group.

01:52.466 --> 01:54.840
Well, if we have to
give an immediate answer,

01:54.841 --> 01:55.958
it would have to be no.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.011
Take your time.

01:57.167 --> 01:58.448
Sleep on it.

01:58.449 --> 01:59.772
Then get back to me.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.026
Or else.

02:04.011 --> 02:06.735
Jeff, you did say we would
let him in eventually.

02:06.736 --> 02:09.291
That was before he started
using his name as a pun.

02:09.527 --> 02:11.282
It makes me so changry.

02:11.283 --> 02:12.426
Oh, God, it's happening to me.

02:12.427 --> 02:14.013
Let's get back to who
Annie's in love with.

02:14.014 --> 02:15.668
- Is it Fat Neil?
- Blue Streak?

02:15.669 --> 02:16.428
Mud Flaps?

02:16.429 --> 02:18.223
Okay, even I know some
of these are Transformers.

02:18.224 --> 02:20.381
Who cares who it is?
Let's just study.

02:20.382 --> 02:21.857
Study what? We haven't
had our first class yet.

02:21.858 --> 02:22.706
Well, could we
talk about something

02:22.707 --> 02:23.631
other than Annie's love life?

02:23.632 --> 02:25.475
We could talk
about my love life.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.532
Is it Jean-Claude van Overbite?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.474
We should really start
learning people's names.

02:30.475 --> 02:32.619
I agree with brown
Jamie Lee Curtis.

02:33.832 --> 02:35.354
♪ Give me some rope ♪

02:35.355 --> 02:36.908
♪ time in a dream ♪

02:37.105 --> 02:38.580
♪ give me the hope ♪

02:38.581 --> 02:40.252

02:40.253 --> 02:43.628

02:43.858 --> 02:47.793

02:52.726 --> 02:56.533
♪ one by one,

02:59.935 --> 03:01.218
Duncan's late.

03:02.073 --> 03:04.590
I hope he didn't drive his
car into another marathon.

03:04.591 --> 03:06.720
Shirley, how can you want
to date your ex-husband

03:06.721 --> 03:08.684
- after what he did to you?
- He apologized.

03:08.685 --> 03:10.150
Oh, he apologized.

03:10.151 --> 03:12.432
Well, I guess that completely
unbangs that stripper.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.167
Well, forgive me
for being forgiving.

03:15.168 --> 03:17.179
Oh, that's right.
You don't know how.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.931
I'm relieved Shirley
is seeing her ex-husband

03:18.932 --> 03:19.912
and not Chang.

03:19.913 --> 03:21.780
Chang? Why would
she be with Chang?

03:21.878 --> 03:24.054
Why do I have to say
everything I'm thinking?

03:24.092 --> 03:26.618
I wish my mouth was further
away from my brain.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.717
I wish my brain had its own brain.

03:28.731 --> 03:30.736
I wish Chang hadn't
had sex with Shirley.

03:30.737 --> 03:32.661
What? When?

03:32.742 --> 03:33.752
Where?

03:35.187 --> 03:36.122
How?

03:36.132 --> 03:37.389
I can't talk about it.

03:37.390 --> 03:38.260
Troy, I'm your roommate.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.808
I can keep a secret.

03:40.779 --> 03:42.770
Okay, remember
that Halloween party

03:42.771 --> 03:43.771
that none of us can remember?

03:43.772 --> 03:45.477
I don't remember
anything we can remember.

03:45.478 --> 03:47.072
Well, Chang left me
a message that night

03:47.073 --> 03:48.161
saying that they did it.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.490
But... but you can't tell anybody.

03:51.055 --> 03:53.405
You have my word
as your roommate,

03:53.406 --> 03:56.629
and that is a bond I
will never violate.

03:57.808 --> 03:59.212
You can't tweet it either.

03:59.213 --> 04:00.674
We never discussed new media.

04:00.675 --> 04:01.928
Sorry all that
stuff got dragged out

04:01.929 --> 04:04.605
about me having a
crush on somebody.

04:04.606 --> 04:05.977
Why would you be
sorry about that?

04:05.978 --> 04:08.404
You know. Awkward.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.853
Annie, you don't think
I actually care, did you?

04:10.854 --> 04:13.653
No, no, I just didn't want you
to think I thought you cared.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.808
Greetings, all and sundry,

04:14.809 --> 04:17.413
and welcome to your second
semester of Anthropology,

04:17.414 --> 04:19.755
where it is about to get real.

04:20.338 --> 04:23.081
Now I forget where we
left off last year.

04:23.092 --> 04:25.056
- Fat Neil.
- The bronze age.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.474
Thank you, Fat Neil.

04:26.514 --> 04:27.105
Neil's fine.

04:27.106 --> 04:28.705
Not from an
actuarial standpoint.

04:28.706 --> 04:30.429
Now please forgive my lateness,

04:30.430 --> 04:34.143
but I wasn't sure how
to find Greendale sober.

04:34.617 --> 04:36.825
Yes, you heard me right.

04:37.058 --> 04:39.155
I have stopped drinking.

04:39.543 --> 04:42.593
Mainly due to the fact that I
could no longer get an erection.

04:42.594 --> 04:43.604
Now that I'm on the wagon,

04:43.605 --> 04:45.445
you can expect both this class

04:45.446 --> 04:50.096
and my penis to be more
focused and rewarding.

04:50.710 --> 04:53.131
Also, there's gonna be
more than one diorama.

04:53.501 --> 04:54.183
Lame!

04:54.184 --> 04:56.472
- Boo.
- I am so sorry.

04:56.834 --> 04:59.983
I train seeing-eye dogs,
and today was graduation.

05:00.098 --> 05:02.158
I couldn't leave without
shaking all their little paws.

05:02.159 --> 05:04.225
- Aww.
- Rich.

05:04.226 --> 05:05.790
- Jeff.
- Rich!

05:05.791 --> 05:08.062
- Annie.
- Annie? Rich?

05:08.063 --> 05:09.308
You're taking Anthropology?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.200
Well, you made it sound so fun.

05:11.201 --> 05:12.575
We spent the holiday break

05:12.576 --> 05:14.213
dredging a river together.
We found...

05:14.214 --> 05:15.420
A finger. Yeah.

05:15.421 --> 05:16.996
It sounds gruesome, I know,

05:16.997 --> 05:18.551
but I'm used to seeing
that kind of thing,

05:18.552 --> 05:20.283
- because I'm a doctor.
- All: Ohh.

05:24.156 --> 05:26.969
I can't believe Rich actually
enrolled in our class.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.115
It means he likes me, right?

05:28.116 --> 05:30.256
Why wouldn't he,
Annie? He is so sweet.

05:30.257 --> 05:32.150
Yeah, sweet and wise.

05:32.151 --> 05:34.235
He has lived such a long,
full life.

05:34.236 --> 05:35.355
How old is he again?

05:35.356 --> 05:36.584
30-something, I'm assuming.

05:36.585 --> 05:39.033
He has a landline and
uses the word "album."

05:39.034 --> 05:40.842
You guys don't think he's
too old for me, do you?

05:40.843 --> 05:43.231
- No.
- No. Come on.

05:43.232 --> 05:46.092
By that logic, I wouldn't have a
shot with anybody at this table.

05:46.093 --> 05:46.955
Ugh.

05:46.956 --> 05:48.348
Oh, speaking of creepy,

05:48.349 --> 05:50.545
sober Duncan is worse
than drunk Duncan.

05:50.546 --> 05:52.675
I think this class is
about to get really hard.

05:52.676 --> 05:54.063
I have an idea about that.

05:54.064 --> 05:55.146
Rich is really smart,

05:55.147 --> 05:56.892
and he knows a lot
about anthropology.

05:56.893 --> 05:58.127
If we were to start
studying with him,

05:58.128 --> 05:59.180
I think it could help a lot.

05:59.181 --> 06:00.970
Plus, you know...

06:01.560 --> 06:03.976
Oh, you know what, though?

06:03.977 --> 06:07.493
I just realized,
so unfair to so many people.

06:07.494 --> 06:09.206
Right? Britta,
you're always talking

06:09.207 --> 06:09.919
about how it's weird

06:09.920 --> 06:11.496
we have no one of Latin descent

06:11.497 --> 06:12.521
- in our group.
- Si.

06:12.522 --> 06:14.104
And, Pierce,
you're always looking

06:14.105 --> 06:15.182
for someone old enough

06:15.183 --> 06:16.989
to find your racism subversive.

06:16.990 --> 06:18.473
I could go on and on.

06:18.597 --> 06:20.349
It is a process.

06:20.418 --> 06:21.319
It takes time.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.225
Well, then I say we
gather all the candidates

06:24.226 --> 06:26.604
and make an informed,
democratic decision.

06:26.605 --> 06:27.807
We can have a little mixer

06:27.808 --> 06:30.330
and invite the people we're
submitting for consideration.

06:30.370 --> 06:33.134
- All in favor of tonight?
- Oh, I am.

06:33.284 --> 06:34.227
Thank you. I'm finished.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.831
No, I'd say you got
about two more good years.

06:37.443 --> 06:38.920
Oh, everyone,

06:39.534 --> 06:42.264
this is Andre,
my ex-husband and boyfriend.

06:42.265 --> 06:43.963
He came to spend the day with me.

06:43.987 --> 06:44.952
Hey, nice to meet you guys.

06:44.953 --> 06:47.409
You know, I've heard a lot
about every last one of you.

06:47.410 --> 06:49.483
We haven't heard a lot
about you or what you've done

06:49.484 --> 06:50.794
or with who.

06:50.971 --> 06:53.464
Well, I hope you give
me a chance to make up

06:53.465 --> 06:55.663
for everything you
haven't heard about me.

06:55.776 --> 06:58.227
Hey, how about a round
of soft serve on me?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.784
Shirley, I've been
fed a lot of soft serve

07:03.785 --> 07:04.869
by a lot of guys.

07:04.870 --> 07:06.140
Sometimes it's rent money,

07:06.141 --> 07:07.708
sometimes it's Chili
Peppers tickets,

07:07.709 --> 07:09.147
and, yeah, I'll admit it,

07:09.148 --> 07:11.309
one time it was a gym
bag full of nickels,

07:11.310 --> 07:14.266
but it never lasts,
and they never change.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.949
Britta, I'm a grown-ass woman,
and I made my decision.

07:16.950 --> 07:18.278
But how do you know
it's the right one?

07:18.279 --> 07:20.303
Because I'm pregnant, okay?

07:24.108 --> 07:27.032
I was going to wait to
share my exciting news,

07:27.033 --> 07:28.899
but I guess now is as good
a time as any to tell you

07:28.900 --> 07:30.788
that I am eight weeks along.

07:30.789 --> 07:32.694
Which is a little surprising.

07:33.882 --> 07:34.893
Halloween.

07:35.170 --> 07:36.645
- What?
- Both: Nothing.

07:38.728 --> 07:42.185
Thanks for coming,
fellow Anthropology students.

07:42.426 --> 07:43.349
For the first semester,

07:43.350 --> 07:45.818
you knew us as "that study group."

07:45.819 --> 07:48.060
But, tonight,
we want to get to know you.

07:48.061 --> 07:49.254
Please forgive the spread.

07:49.255 --> 07:50.486
The vending machines
haven't been restocked

07:50.487 --> 07:51.685
since before winter break.

07:51.686 --> 07:54.268
So help yourselves
to tropical skittles,

07:54.269 --> 07:55.663
cigarettes, or mouthwash.

07:55.664 --> 07:58.757
And have a good time.

08:00.941 --> 08:03.619
Okay, so I have to figure
out if Shirley did it

08:03.620 --> 08:06.004
with her ex-husband the
week after Halloween.

08:06.551 --> 08:07.867
How are you gonna do that?

08:08.839 --> 08:10.201
I got moves.

08:10.715 --> 08:12.852
So...Bun in the oven.

08:12.853 --> 08:15.504
Guess it's no surprise after
working on it all this time.

08:15.505 --> 08:17.157
Well, I wouldn't quite
say working on it.

08:17.158 --> 08:18.156
Just kind of happens, you know.

08:18.157 --> 08:19.694
Oh, yeah, I do.

08:19.695 --> 08:21.641
Especially when the
season's right.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.188
Dead leaves, pumpkins everywhere...

08:24.528 --> 08:26.983
Nature's Viagra. Right?

08:27.483 --> 08:27.991
I guess.

08:27.992 --> 08:29.264
And then when all the pumpkins

08:29.265 --> 08:30.915
just start to rot

08:31.035 --> 08:33.404
and all the children have
removed their outfits

08:34.143 --> 08:37.211
because they've already
gotten their candy...

08:40.020 --> 08:42.193
I'm gonna go talk to some
other people, all right?

08:47.950 --> 08:50.164
- So?
- His mind is like a fortress.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.008
Why don't we just tell Shirley,

08:52.009 --> 08:54.046
"Hey, look, you slept with Chang"?

08:54.047 --> 08:55.217
Let her deal with it.

08:55.218 --> 08:56.750
Pierce, if someone
had sex with Chang

08:56.751 --> 08:58.771
and they get to not
remember that happened,

08:58.772 --> 09:00.357
that's a gift from God.

09:00.358 --> 09:02.474
I'm not taking that away from
her without a good reason.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.471
Well, here's a good reason.

09:03.472 --> 09:04.343
You ever go to the bathroom

09:04.344 --> 09:05.446
and find parsley in your teeth

09:05.447 --> 09:07.935
that your friends
hadn't told you about?

09:08.030 --> 09:09.782
Now imagine your
teeth are a uterus

09:09.783 --> 09:12.552
and that parsley is
a half-Chinese baby.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.408
Hey, guys.

09:13.484 --> 09:14.922
I want you to meet someone.

09:15.367 --> 09:16.731
My name is Quendra,

09:16.768 --> 09:18.393
and I spell it with a Q-U.

09:18.394 --> 09:20.779
She's thinking about
taking Anthropology.

09:20.780 --> 09:23.162
So maybe she would make
a nice addition or two

09:23.163 --> 09:25.567
to our study group.
Something to consider.

09:25.568 --> 09:27.084
Are you Abed?

09:27.085 --> 09:28.765
I love Star Wars.

09:28.766 --> 09:31.477
- That's Troy.
- I love footballs.

09:31.478 --> 09:33.379
Jeff, we're dealing with
heavier things right now

09:33.380 --> 09:35.092
than your shameless lobbying.

09:35.093 --> 09:36.570
Rich brought kettle corn!

09:36.571 --> 09:38.849
Kettle corn!
That's a fun-time snack.

09:38.850 --> 09:40.953
- Oh, looks great.
- I make it in my garage.

09:41.621 --> 09:43.173
I'll take some of that.

09:44.696 --> 09:46.649
I spell kettle corn with a Q-U.

09:46.650 --> 09:48.077
Well, don't.

09:48.466 --> 09:49.946
What is this? What's going on?

09:49.947 --> 09:50.636
It's a mixer.

09:50.637 --> 09:52.786
Why is everyone from
Anthro class here?

09:53.263 --> 09:55.439
Are you guys picking a
new study group member?

09:55.501 --> 09:57.135
And you didn't invite me?

09:57.291 --> 09:58.427
We didn't know how to reach you.

09:58.428 --> 10:00.797
What are you talking about?
I'm everywhere.

10:01.073 --> 10:02.174
We didn't know how to reach you.

10:02.175 --> 10:04.233
That's not a true. That's a lie.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.133
It's a mixer. We didn't
know how to reach you.

10:06.134 --> 10:07.933
It's a mixer. It's a mixer.
It's a mixer.

10:07.934 --> 10:09.610
It's a mixer. It's a mixer.

10:11.735 --> 10:12.830
Works every time.

10:16.108 --> 10:18.632
$50? What a pig.

10:25.388 --> 10:27.963
Jeff, I think we
should vote now.

10:27.964 --> 10:29.800
Most people left after
we ran out of skittles,

10:29.801 --> 10:31.348
and, come on, it's pretty obvious

10:31.349 --> 10:32.254
Rich is the best candidate.

10:32.255 --> 10:34.187
Yeah. Looks like he's our guy.

10:34.188 --> 10:35.241
I'll be right there.

10:36.841 --> 10:38.482
This can't be happening.

10:38.797 --> 10:40.233
I agree.

10:44.837 --> 10:46.351
You can't talk and
then do a slow clap.

10:46.352 --> 10:47.888
You don't know that.

10:48.035 --> 10:49.201
But I know this.

10:49.487 --> 10:52.505
Unless you want a front row
seat to Annie loves Richie,

10:52.506 --> 10:55.938
it's time to Chang
your point of view.

10:55.939 --> 10:57.195
It's not even clever.

10:57.196 --> 10:59.334
You keep using it
as the word change.

11:02.209 --> 11:03.952
Okay. Okay.

11:03.953 --> 11:07.720
Okay. Just do me a favor.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.880
Let me do all the talking
and follow my lead.

11:09.881 --> 11:11.435
- Deal.
- Okay.

11:13.572 --> 11:14.921
Seriously,
do you have brain damage?

11:14.922 --> 11:17.295
Rich is also board-certified
in pediatrics,

11:17.296 --> 11:19.527
and, once a month,
he flies down to volunteer

11:19.528 --> 11:22.051
in the rain forest,
fixing children's cleft palates

11:22.052 --> 11:24.057
and teaching them acoustic guitar.

11:24.058 --> 11:24.944
Other than that,

11:24.945 --> 11:27.656
well, his kettle corn
speaks for itself.

11:27.657 --> 11:28.956
I couldn't agree more.

11:28.957 --> 11:31.255
It looks like this is
an open-and-shut case.

11:31.256 --> 11:33.230
Did someone say case?

11:33.232 --> 11:34.966
Because I haven't made mine yet.

11:34.967 --> 11:36.987
What? What's your case?

11:36.988 --> 11:39.563
Ben Chang is my case.

11:39.564 --> 11:40.938
You can't be serious.

11:40.939 --> 11:42.308
Oh, I'm serious, baby.

11:42.309 --> 11:43.623
I am yahoo serious.

11:43.624 --> 11:44.634
I'm serious F.M.

11:44.635 --> 11:47.009
Welcome to the world
serious of seriousness,

11:47.010 --> 11:49.185
sponsored by honey nut serios.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.465
Are you stalling right now?

11:50.466 --> 11:51.670
Stalling?

11:53.726 --> 11:54.788
Stalling?

11:54.789 --> 11:56.834
No, Annie, in fact,
you're gonna wish

11:56.835 --> 11:58.859
I was stalling...
Oh, I just got it. Thank you.

12:02.094 --> 12:03.729
I want to say some names to you.

12:04.719 --> 12:05.847
Jeffrey Dahmer.

12:06.763 --> 12:07.929
Ted Bundy.

12:09.506 --> 12:10.480
Rich.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.849
What do they have in common?

12:13.822 --> 12:16.395
We don't know them very well.

12:16.746 --> 12:18.803
What do we know about Ben Chang?

12:19.583 --> 12:21.564
- We know he's nuts.
- Let him finish!

12:21.644 --> 12:24.639
We know he's dangerous,
unpredictable, selfish.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.292
We know he uses his
name to make bad puns.

12:27.293 --> 12:28.530
Guilty as changed.

12:28.531 --> 12:31.792
When he talks,
he over and underemphasizes words

12:31.793 --> 12:33.123
seemingly at random.

12:33.124 --> 12:35.281
When he eats, he holds his fork

12:35.282 --> 12:36.926
like a murderer's knife,

12:36.927 --> 12:40.727
gnawing at its skewered payload
like a deranged woodland rodent.

12:40.728 --> 12:41.627
Bring it home!

12:41.628 --> 12:43.370
We know he smells
like band-aids.

12:43.371 --> 12:45.613
We know he dresses like
a Cuban cab driver.

12:45.614 --> 12:49.262
We know he exhibits,
nay, flaunts proudly

12:49.263 --> 12:51.946
obvious symptoms of over
half a dozen disorders

12:51.947 --> 12:54.474
you wouldn't wish on
your worst enemy's pets.

12:54.475 --> 12:55.558
Feel the heat!

12:55.559 --> 12:58.969
We know these things
about Ben Chang.

12:58.970 --> 13:02.408
And so much more than we ever
wanted to know about him.

13:02.409 --> 13:03.302
Why?

13:04.620 --> 13:05.943
Because it's there.

13:06.255 --> 13:08.427
It's on the surface.

13:08.434 --> 13:11.352
What you see may be
what you don't want,

13:11.353 --> 13:14.926
but it's also what you get.

13:16.064 --> 13:16.999
Wow.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.504
Who is this
kettle-corn-popping phantom?

13:20.739 --> 13:22.468
This human question mark?

13:22.469 --> 13:25.002
This number eight scoop
of vanilla tapioca

13:25.003 --> 13:27.343
with a Ph.D in being swell

13:27.344 --> 13:29.874
and a master's in
"everybody loves me"?

13:29.875 --> 13:30.925
Who is it?

13:33.921 --> 13:35.164
We may never know.

13:37.138 --> 13:39.631
I only know one thing.

13:41.043 --> 13:43.567
Nobody is this good a person.

13:45.326 --> 13:48.393
And nobody can get any worse

13:48.394 --> 13:49.520
than this.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.727
Now.

14:01.983 --> 14:04.234
Who's voting for Chang?

14:06.157 --> 14:08.136
Who's voting for Rich?

14:11.669 --> 14:13.649
- Shirley.
- Wow, what you gonna do, baby?

14:13.650 --> 14:15.011
I don't know.

14:17.081 --> 14:20.177
Shirley, this is the best
kettle corn I've ever had.

14:20.178 --> 14:21.959
If you don't vote for Rich,

14:22.350 --> 14:23.510
I'll shatter your world.

14:23.511 --> 14:24.296
You're gonna what?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.833
I'll shatter your world.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.583
I heard you. I vote for Chang.

14:27.584 --> 14:30.307
- Yes!
- Yes! In your face!

14:30.308 --> 14:31.699
- No!
- Yes!

14:31.700 --> 14:32.594
No!

14:33.569 --> 14:36.089
Chang and Shirley had
sex on Halloween.

14:37.062 --> 14:37.920
What?

14:38.037 --> 14:39.401
- What?
- You may be pregnant

14:39.402 --> 14:43.260
- with his baby.
- No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

14:43.261 --> 14:44.157
Pierce!

14:44.668 --> 14:45.948
She crossed me.

14:45.949 --> 14:49.839
Is that why you were subtly
interrogating me?

14:50.229 --> 14:52.118
- Troy?
- Chang left me a voice mail

14:52.119 --> 14:55.512
on Halloween to say
that you two did it.

14:55.513 --> 14:57.132
I could hear you
in the background.

14:57.913 --> 14:59.670
Shirley,
what is he talking about?

15:00.032 --> 15:01.547
I don't remember that night.

15:01.745 --> 15:02.889
Nobody remembers anything.

15:02.890 --> 15:05.952
Oh, now I understand
these photos.

15:07.635 --> 15:09.606
Do you mind if I forward
these to my brother?

15:09.607 --> 15:12.053
Oh! I want this man out of here.

15:12.054 --> 15:13.820
Well, you just
voted him in, so...

15:13.821 --> 15:15.389
What is wrong with you?

15:15.390 --> 15:16.567
Shirley is in crisis.

15:16.568 --> 15:18.139
This isn't silly anymore.

15:18.140 --> 15:19.577
I don't understand.

15:19.773 --> 15:21.339
Just... just wait, baby.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.118
I don't understand either,
but we can work this out.

15:23.119 --> 15:24.400
We'll figure it out.

15:27.976 --> 15:29.220
Andre, no.

15:31.858 --> 15:35.431
I think that this
is a good time to go.

15:35.432 --> 15:36.440
Rich!

15:36.441 --> 15:37.453
No!

15:41.180 --> 15:43.166
You finally did it, Jeff Winger.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.269
You finally hurt this group
in a way that'll never heal.

15:48.728 --> 15:49.918
Kettle corn!

15:56.481 --> 15:57.498
There you are.

15:58.268 --> 15:59.476
Can you please explain to me

15:59.477 --> 16:00.422
what the hell you've been doing?

16:00.423 --> 16:02.339
Well, Annie, when a man

16:02.340 --> 16:04.075
loves food and beverages very much

16:04.076 --> 16:05.609
and they pass through his system,

16:05.610 --> 16:07.495
- they make...
- I'm not in the mood, Jeff.

16:07.496 --> 16:08.320
Explain your behavior

16:08.321 --> 16:09.529
with Rich today.

16:09.530 --> 16:11.476
Sorry, not everyone
is as in love

16:11.477 --> 16:13.720
with Dr. Do-No-Wrong as you are.

16:13.721 --> 16:15.232
And don't say it's
because I'm jealous

16:15.233 --> 16:16.053
of him being with you.

16:16.054 --> 16:18.252
Oh, come on, Jeff!

16:18.253 --> 16:19.286
I'm sick of this.

16:19.287 --> 16:20.789
One minute, I'm too young to date.

16:20.790 --> 16:23.062
The next, you're trying
to get rid of guys I like.

16:23.063 --> 16:24.862
Either you want me or you don't.

16:24.863 --> 16:25.797
What's it gonna be?

16:25.798 --> 16:27.202
I wish I could
give you an answer

16:27.203 --> 16:30.284
that makes sense, but
relationships are complicated,

16:30.285 --> 16:31.830
and we're in the men's room.

16:31.831 --> 16:35.221
Fine. Well,
I'm gonna ask Rich out.

16:35.478 --> 16:37.070
Nothing complicated about that.

16:40.993 --> 16:42.060
- There you are.
- Did I walk

16:42.061 --> 16:43.132
into the wrong bathroom?

16:43.133 --> 16:44.819
You have to find
Andre and talk to him.

16:44.820 --> 16:46.186
Shirley is devastated.

16:46.187 --> 16:48.286
Since when do you want
him back in her life?

16:48.287 --> 16:50.250
I don't deny that I'm
not a fan of the guy,

16:50.251 --> 16:51.214
but I'm a fan of Shirley,

16:51.215 --> 16:52.893
and this is what she wants.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:01.554 --> 17:02.449
There you are.

17:09.747 --> 17:10.990
Mezzanine?

17:18.439 --> 17:20.179
- Nice sweater.
- Thanks.

17:20.444 --> 17:21.813
My dad gave it to me.

17:22.981 --> 17:26.786
- So, um...
- Look, I'm not mad at Shirley.

17:26.954 --> 17:27.964
You're not?

17:28.079 --> 17:30.450
No. I'm mad at myself.

17:31.111 --> 17:32.632
You know, if I hadn't
left her like I did,

17:32.633 --> 17:34.310
then none of this
would have happened.

17:35.710 --> 17:38.175
You ever have something that
you didn't truly appreciate

17:38.176 --> 17:40.023
until you didn't have it anymore?

17:40.024 --> 17:43.387
Oh, yeah. Keristina.

17:43.737 --> 17:44.439
Old girlfriend?

17:44.440 --> 17:45.708
Almond facial scrub.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.142
They only make it in Finland.

17:48.357 --> 17:51.005
The old me would have
been long gone by now.

17:51.545 --> 17:52.891
I didn't think I
could ever change,

17:52.892 --> 17:55.064
but I'm gonna tell you,
the love of a good woman

17:55.065 --> 17:56.557
makes anything possible.

17:59.664 --> 18:01.864
Well, it looks like I'm
gonna be a daddy again.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.691
- Yeah, but...
- Hey.

18:03.846 --> 18:06.028
Doesn't matter who
the baby's father is.

18:06.178 --> 18:07.799
I'm in it for the long haul.

18:08.419 --> 18:09.584
And if it's mine,

18:09.868 --> 18:11.578
it's gonna be a great
football player.

18:12.005 --> 18:13.327
And if it's Chang's,

18:14.699 --> 18:16.098
we'll go for golf.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.209
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:28.772 --> 18:30.211
Annie just texted me.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.533
She asked Rich out.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.536
Cool.

18:33.537 --> 18:34.548
He said no.

18:35.635 --> 18:37.771
He said she's great but too young.

19:11.206 --> 19:13.692
Don't say anything until
I've said what I've got to say.

19:14.637 --> 19:16.723
I've known you for
almost two years now,

19:16.724 --> 19:20.298
and I've never taken you as
seriously as I should have.

19:20.843 --> 19:25.607
You are the strangest,
coolest, most genuine person

19:25.608 --> 19:29.600
I've ever met,
and the thing that scares me

19:29.601 --> 19:33.080
about you is how good
you make me wish I was.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.383
Help me, Rich.

19:36.705 --> 19:38.299
Help me become like you.

19:39.389 --> 19:43.814
I mean, I am so amazing.

19:45.448 --> 19:47.118
But I'm not perfect.

19:48.713 --> 19:49.644
You are.

19:51.159 --> 19:53.064
Give me that power.

19:54.423 --> 19:56.016
So I can abuse it.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.915
Jeff, you are one funny bunny.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.577
You can't just fake being good

20:01.578 --> 20:03.207
in order to get away
with doing bad things.

20:03.208 --> 20:05.172
Oh, I completely understand.

20:05.521 --> 20:09.606
And do you understand
that I still have to try?

20:10.225 --> 20:12.634
And if you don't help me,

20:13.100 --> 20:14.422
you're a bad person.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.736
You got me there, guy.

20:17.871 --> 20:19.466
Come on in and dry off.

20:20.891 --> 20:23.590
Oh, it smells delicious.
Are you baking?

20:23.591 --> 20:25.315
Yeah, muffin tops.

20:26.904 --> 20:28.252
And we're back.
Today, we'll show you

20:28.253 --> 20:30.286
how to make homemade
kettle corn with Dr. Rich.

20:30.287 --> 20:31.090
Rich, how do I get

20:31.091 --> 20:32.421
one of those giant spoons?

20:32.422 --> 20:34.724
Well, actually,
I carved this one myself

20:34.725 --> 20:36.946
after lightning struck an
oak tree in my backyard.

20:36.947 --> 20:38.919
- Ooh.
- And then I made my nephew

20:38.920 --> 20:39.687
a rocking horse.

20:39.688 --> 20:42.055
- That's adorable.
- It smells heavenly.

20:42.056 --> 20:43.986
Dr. Rich, what sets
your kettle corn apart?

20:43.987 --> 20:45.754
Well, it's a secret ingredient...

20:45.755 --> 20:47.143
a couple extra pinches of love.

20:47.144 --> 20:48.900
Oh, you can't beat that.

20:48.901 --> 20:50.470
- It feels good.
- Not this again.

20:50.471 --> 20:53.202
Rich, you know they're
doing a fake morning show?

20:53.514 --> 20:54.796
There are no cameras.

20:55.152 --> 20:56.048
I know.

20:56.203 --> 20:58.181
It's just a fun way
to start the day.

20:58.182 --> 20:59.576
So grab a paddle, partner,

20:59.577 --> 21:01.004
and hop on in here.

21:01.005 --> 21:02.677
You know what,
that does sound...

21:02.678 --> 21:03.628
Yeah.

21:05.552 --> 21:08.195
Troy and Abed in the morning.

21:08.395 --> 21:13.595
