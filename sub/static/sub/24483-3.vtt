WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.894
Previously, on "The Expanse"...

00:06.799 --> 00:09.418
We need to send a message
that the UN is trying to kill us.

00:09.453 --> 00:11.165
I'm leaving our names out of it.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.664
Release sequence engaged.

00:14.774 --> 00:16.306
The Roci picked up a distress call.

00:16.341 --> 00:18.276
- It's Julie Mao's ship.
- We're not responding.

00:18.311 --> 00:19.377
So we just go back to business?

00:19.412 --> 00:20.544
Can you look him in the eye and tell him

00:20.580 --> 00:22.310
that whatever this might be
is more important

00:22.346 --> 00:25.283
- than finding his kid?
- Anna, I need your help.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.118
It'll be the single, most
important speech of my life.

00:27.153 --> 00:28.347
I want you to help me write it.

00:28.382 --> 00:30.955
You want me to help you justify this war.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.557
We didn't start it,
but for the good of the system

00:33.593 --> 00:36.027
- we need to win it and end it.
- Jules-Pierre Mao

00:36.062 --> 00:37.692
- can't hide forever.
- We know where

00:37.727 --> 00:39.697
- his children live.
- Galactic punishment

00:39.732 --> 00:41.899
is still a war crime, look it up.

00:41.934 --> 00:44.702
We're all in agreement.
Tycho is the only way

00:44.737 --> 00:46.645
- we survive.
- Io. Hell with it, I'm in.

00:46.681 --> 00:48.506
- Amos...
- Me too.

00:48.541 --> 00:50.290
Detonation confirmed. Our other six

00:50.326 --> 00:52.610
are in formation around the racing ship.

00:52.645 --> 00:54.712
If you've got a better plan,
now would be the time.

00:54.747 --> 00:56.781
Let's do it.

01:01.587 --> 01:04.355
- We did it.
- Yeah, we sure did.

01:04.390 --> 01:07.058
We just declared war on Earth.

01:07.093 --> 01:09.126
Help her, please.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

01:59.112 --> 02:01.563
Who defaced the Martian flag
on the bulkhead?

02:03.383 --> 02:06.183
- I updated it.
- You think that's funny?

02:06.219 --> 02:08.018
- Maybe not now...
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:08.054 --> 02:09.753
Let's, uh... let's start everything off

02:09.788 --> 02:11.020
on the right foot, shall we?

02:11.056 --> 02:12.556
Okay.

02:12.592 --> 02:14.326
You got everything you need
off your ship?

02:14.945 --> 02:16.611
I need to charge my armor.

02:16.647 --> 02:18.789
Not until you tell us what's going on.

02:20.951 --> 02:22.684
I did a rotation on the Donnager.

02:22.719 --> 02:25.086
This ship is the Tachi,
and it's more mine than yours.

02:25.122 --> 02:26.688
Punch the panel all you like.

02:26.723 --> 02:28.323
You're locked out of our systems.

02:28.358 --> 02:30.358
You think I need my armor
to take this ship?

02:30.394 --> 02:31.760
- Be interesting to find out.
- Not for you.

02:31.795 --> 02:33.762
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:33.797 --> 02:35.630
Okay, let's just remember, you called us.

02:35.666 --> 02:37.966
Okay, I think saving your lives
earned us an explanation.

02:38.001 --> 02:40.468
A Martian Marine with the
Deputy Secretary of Earth,

02:40.504 --> 02:42.604
on Julie Mao's ship, with the UN

02:42.639 --> 02:43.668
trying to kill them.

02:43.703 --> 02:45.148
Start with that.

02:46.310 --> 02:47.876
I can't tell you. It's classified.

02:47.911 --> 02:50.178
Ah, come on. We crippled a UNN gunship

02:50.213 --> 02:51.813
- to save your hide.
- I didn't call you,

02:51.848 --> 02:53.448
- I called the MCRN.
- Can you just settle down,

02:53.483 --> 02:54.949
- now, darling, please?
- Call me darling again

02:54.985 --> 02:56.351
and you'll be saying
that drawl in sign language.

02:56.386 --> 02:57.619
Sounds like things are going well.

02:57.654 --> 02:59.371
The Martians are bonding.

03:01.992 --> 03:03.958
- How is she?
- Stable.

03:03.994 --> 03:06.861
She's got some neural damage,
but nothing meds can't fix.

03:06.897 --> 03:08.763
A few more minutes in that burn
might've killed her.

03:08.799 --> 03:11.091
This one's not telling us
why they're out here.

03:12.035 --> 03:14.969
- That's not our concern.
- Of course it is.

03:15.005 --> 03:17.539
We just dodged a massive bullet.

03:17.574 --> 03:19.574
Scopes are clear. No ships tracking us.

03:19.609 --> 03:21.242
It's a God damn miracle,

03:21.278 --> 03:22.877
getting out of this thing
like nothing happened.

03:22.913 --> 03:25.605
- Something did happen.
- It's over and done.

03:26.183 --> 03:28.900
We're going to Io. Right?

03:29.353 --> 03:31.786
- That's right.
- Io?

03:31.822 --> 03:33.955
My daughter's there. We hope.

03:33.990 --> 03:35.657
Madam Avasarala has information

03:35.692 --> 03:36.858
that could help stop this war.

03:36.893 --> 03:38.636
You can't just drag her to Io
in the midst of it

03:38.671 --> 03:40.061
Then take your ship and leave.

03:40.097 --> 03:41.705
No one's keeping you here.

03:42.432 --> 03:43.998
We're target practice in that thing.

03:44.034 --> 03:45.066
It's defenseless, the comms
are locked out,

03:45.102 --> 03:47.669
- it's not...
- We'll fix your comms!

03:47.704 --> 03:50.672
After that, we don't owe you anything.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.613
You can't just turn your back and pretend

03:58.648 --> 04:00.515
this war isn't happening.

04:00.550 --> 04:03.852
If they don't use the ship,
then you should take it and go.

04:03.887 --> 04:05.479
Go to Tycho.

04:06.223 --> 04:08.223
Do what you have to do.

04:32.849 --> 04:34.783
We have confirmed ID on the contact.

04:34.818 --> 04:38.653
It is a Martian Stealth-C
Ballistic Missile Platform.

04:38.688 --> 04:40.422
It holds 10 planet busters,

04:40.457 --> 04:43.324
each with 20 high-yield MIRV warheads.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.493
Our Watchtower satellites
are the only things that can

04:45.529 --> 04:48.430
penetrate their stealth tech,
but it's far from perfect.

04:48.465 --> 04:50.932
This is the first time that
we've been able to locate

04:50.967 --> 04:52.467
two of their Platforms at once.

04:52.502 --> 04:53.668
It's a hell of a break.

04:53.703 --> 04:55.670
And a golden opportunity.

04:55.705 --> 04:58.273
Now, the Martians are always
moving these Platforms

04:58.308 --> 04:59.641
and they're using sensor blinding,

04:59.676 --> 05:01.409
so when they move, we lose them.

05:01.445 --> 05:03.378
But as a group, they're always positioned

05:03.413 --> 05:05.613
to optimize strike times to Earth.

05:05.649 --> 05:07.015
So if we know where two of them are,

05:07.050 --> 05:08.316
we can predict where the rest of them

05:08.351 --> 05:09.317
most likely will be.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.518
How many Platforms are out there?

05:10.554 --> 05:14.589
Intel says five, and confidence is high.

05:14.624 --> 05:16.291
If we can find the other three,
then we can use

05:16.326 --> 05:18.760
our planetary rail guns to simultaneously

05:18.795 --> 05:20.762
destroy them all before launch.

05:20.797 --> 05:22.931
- A preemptive strike.
- Yes.

05:22.966 --> 05:24.833
It would have to be perfect.

05:24.868 --> 05:27.969
If it's not, Mars will
retaliate immediately.

05:28.004 --> 05:31.306
With justification. Millions of
lives would be at risk.

05:31.341 --> 05:34.476
Yes, but sir, our operatives
in the MCRN Command

05:34.511 --> 05:35.610
are convinced that they're on the verge

05:35.645 --> 05:36.845
- of launching anyway, so...
- Why would they?

05:36.880 --> 05:39.080
'Cause they're losing
the war and they know it.

05:39.115 --> 05:40.782
Well, fighting in the Outer Planets

05:40.817 --> 05:42.951
is different than bringing
it to our own doorstep.

05:43.820 --> 05:45.579
Mars isn't stupid.

05:46.223 --> 05:47.355
Or crazy.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.157
They could be deliberately leaking,

05:49.192 --> 05:50.492
pushg us to the peace table.

05:50.527 --> 05:51.726
Sir, that's not what's happening here.

05:51.761 --> 05:54.329
If this doesn't work, millions will die.

05:54.364 --> 05:56.998
People are dying right now. Our people.

05:57.033 --> 05:58.606
When we began this war,
we had a five to one

05:58.642 --> 05:59.701
advantage in ships.

05:59.736 --> 06:00.935
Now it's down to three to one.

06:00.971 --> 06:04.138
Every minute this war
goes on costs us more lives.

06:04.174 --> 06:06.508
Every loss that we inflict on Mars

06:06.543 --> 06:08.518
pushes them closer to launch.

06:09.980 --> 06:13.356
If we do this, we save lives
because it will end the war.

06:15.619 --> 06:18.353
Find the other Platforms.
I'll give you my decision then.

06:24.261 --> 06:32.267
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:49.819 --> 06:51.353
Somebody heard us.

06:52.556 --> 06:54.055
We're saved.

06:57.561 --> 07:00.070
It's the UNN Agatha King.

07:01.064 --> 07:03.898
The flagship of the Jupiter fleet.

07:12.108 --> 07:13.875
- How many survivors?
- Unknown.

07:13.910 --> 07:15.076
They must've lost comms. We pinged their

07:15.111 --> 07:16.778
distress beacon, but the registry data

07:16.813 --> 07:17.812
on the answer-back was minimal.

07:17.847 --> 07:20.465
No manifest, no crew list, nothing.

07:21.117 --> 07:22.750
Any skiff in the fleet
could've handled this.

07:22.786 --> 07:24.485
Why send us?

07:24.521 --> 07:26.921
Lot I don't understand about this war.

07:26.957 --> 07:29.991
But even in low-g,
shit still rolls downhill.

07:30.026 --> 07:31.793
Does this remind you of Vesta?

07:31.828 --> 07:34.312
This is nothing like Vesta.

07:36.099 --> 07:38.333
Electrical's still not fixed?

07:38.368 --> 07:41.069
Re-patching decks 2 and 3 as we speak.

07:41.104 --> 07:43.504
Wiring on this bucket
really needs an overhaul.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.807
Let's hope her outsides hold
up better than her insides.

07:45.842 --> 07:47.775
She won't let us down.

07:47.811 --> 07:49.677
There's a reason we don't put
these old girls out to pasture.

07:49.713 --> 07:52.480
- Budget cuts.
- Agatha, don't listen to them.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.916
They'll learn to love you.

07:57.187 --> 08:00.121
Incoming tight-beam, sir,
From Admiral Nguyen.

08:00.156 --> 08:02.423
Maybe that's another glitch.

08:02.459 --> 08:03.675
Put it up.

08:04.661 --> 08:07.128
Admiral Souther, any
survivors on the Drop Ship

08:07.163 --> 08:08.363
are to be considered prisoners

08:08.398 --> 08:10.832
and taken to the brig immediately.

08:10.867 --> 08:13.635
No one is to speak
to them until I get there.

08:13.670 --> 08:15.269
That's an order.

08:15.305 --> 08:16.971
Transmitting rendezvous coordinates.

08:17.007 --> 08:18.272
See you shortly.

08:18.308 --> 08:20.567
Nguyen's coming here in person.

08:21.411 --> 08:23.011
Apparently.

08:23.046 --> 08:24.178
If they were gonna blow us up

08:24.214 --> 08:25.446
then they'd have done it already.

08:25.482 --> 08:27.157
So that's a good sign, right?

08:27.684 --> 08:30.018
So we just have to
get our story straight.

08:30.053 --> 08:32.787
Uh, we can say that we're the
only ones survived,

08:32.822 --> 08:34.355
that no one else got off the ship.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.524
We can say that I wasn't
trying to help them,

08:36.558 --> 08:37.692
- or you...
- Theo...

08:37.727 --> 08:38.960
Or whatever you want me to say.

08:38.995 --> 08:41.328
- What do... what do you want me to say?
- Theo!

08:41.364 --> 08:42.756
Relax.

08:43.265 --> 08:45.091
It's gonna be okay.

08:45.869 --> 08:49.346
Take a deep breath and close your eyes.

08:50.106 --> 08:51.673
- Relax.
- And just breathe.

08:51.708 --> 08:54.409
All right. Relax and breathe.

08:54.444 --> 08:56.978
Relax, breathe.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.851
- Ah!
- I'm sorry, Theo.

09:03.887 --> 09:05.486
I'm really sorry.

09:29.423 --> 09:31.523
It's good the children
get to play together.

09:31.558 --> 09:32.957
Oh, absolutely.

09:32.993 --> 09:34.726
It keeps their cortisol levels low,

09:34.761 --> 09:37.395
which enhances protomolecule uptake.

09:51.445 --> 09:54.646
- Guess who?
- Stop it!

09:54.681 --> 09:56.681
- Katoa!
- Sorry, I didn't mean

09:56.717 --> 09:57.872
to scare you.

10:03.223 --> 10:04.889
- Does it hurt?
- Uh-uh.

10:04.925 --> 10:07.158
- I feel strong.
- Really?

10:07.194 --> 10:09.728
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, time for bed.

10:09.763 --> 10:11.896
Come on, let's go.

10:14.868 --> 10:17.202
Hey, wanna see something cool?

10:21.241 --> 10:24.109
Katoa! Come on.

10:24.144 --> 10:26.211
Would you get down, please?

10:26.246 --> 10:29.487
Katoa! Come down!

10:30.283 --> 10:31.950
Have the others been infected?

10:31.985 --> 10:33.218
I don't have a large supply,

10:33.253 --> 10:35.019
so I like to go one at a time.

10:35.055 --> 10:38.123
The current subject is the best
candidate genetically.

10:38.158 --> 10:40.458
Don't worry, there's no risk
of contagion.

10:40.494 --> 10:42.528
Not at this stage.

10:49.304 --> 10:50.603
Thanks for speaking up earlier

10:50.639 --> 10:52.138
about still going to Io.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.540
We said we were gonna take you there.

10:54.576 --> 10:56.609
- Ah!
- Sorry.

10:56.645 --> 10:58.044
Thought you said you've done this before.

10:58.079 --> 11:00.713
I have. Just not on someone else.

11:00.749 --> 11:02.281
I don't want you looking
like Frankenstein

11:02.317 --> 11:03.883
when Mei sees you.

11:03.918 --> 11:05.652
Frankenstein was the name of the doctor.

11:05.687 --> 11:07.817
The monster didn't have a name.

11:09.124 --> 11:11.905
God damn. That's right.

11:13.328 --> 11:15.328
Why do you believe Mei's still alive?

11:15.363 --> 11:17.163
Everyone who ever cared about me on Earth

11:17.198 --> 11:18.787
thinks I'm dead.

11:20.368 --> 11:23.469
- But here I am.
- Baltimore...

11:23.505 --> 11:25.271
that's where you're from, right?

11:25.306 --> 11:26.906
Charm City.

11:26.941 --> 11:29.075
That's where you learned to do this?

11:29.110 --> 11:31.341
This and everything else I had to.

11:32.047 --> 11:34.928
You mean those specific
people skills you have.

11:35.450 --> 11:38.890
Back there, getting by was getting even.

11:40.055 --> 11:42.288
That's a dark way to look at the world.

11:42.323 --> 11:44.957
None of the people that
I dealt with were innocent.

11:44.993 --> 11:47.126
Did most of them a favor.

11:47.162 --> 11:50.630
Dying is the only way
of getting out of Baltimore.

11:50.665 --> 11:53.032
So how'd you get out?

11:53.068 --> 11:55.101
I died.

12:08.883 --> 12:10.850
Alex, can you hear me?

12:10.885 --> 12:12.852
Loud and clear.

12:12.887 --> 12:14.687
Comms restored.

12:14.723 --> 12:16.689
I kept override control
in case our guests

12:16.725 --> 12:19.125
- try anything cute.
- Good thinking.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.294
Hey, Naomi, you know
what might be a good idea

12:21.329 --> 12:23.463
is to slave that ship to the Roci.

12:23.498 --> 12:24.931
I'd rather have that thing following

12:24.966 --> 12:26.132
rather than hooked up, in case

12:26.167 --> 12:28.034
more shit goes down,
you know what I mean?

12:28.069 --> 12:30.358
You're right. I'm on it.

13:16.818 --> 13:18.651
We missed a lot.

13:18.686 --> 13:21.034
Maybe waking up wasn't the best thing.

13:22.056 --> 13:23.995
I didn't think you were going to.

13:24.492 --> 13:26.526
Thank you for not letting me die.

13:29.230 --> 13:30.730
Proud to be of service, ma'am.

13:30.765 --> 13:33.900
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

13:39.107 --> 13:43.743
James Holden.
Maybe I shouldn't be surprised.

13:43.778 --> 13:45.945
Chaos has a way of finding you.

13:45.980 --> 13:48.648
We're all victims of circumstance.

13:48.683 --> 13:51.584
That might be a good title
for your memoirs.

13:51.619 --> 13:53.152
How are you feeling?

13:53.188 --> 13:55.318
I freaking hate space.

13:55.957 --> 13:58.090
Well, it does take some getting used to,

13:58.126 --> 14:00.259
but you already curse like a sailor.

14:00.295 --> 14:02.628
Patience was never one of my virtues,

14:02.664 --> 14:04.797
amongst many other things.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.632
But at least...

14:06.668 --> 14:09.268
I can get to thank you in person

14:09.304 --> 14:12.638
for everything you did
during the Eros incident.

14:12.674 --> 14:14.253
You're a hero.

14:15.043 --> 14:16.464
No.

14:17.312 --> 14:19.312
Miller and Julie were the heroes.

14:20.515 --> 14:23.416
Well, from the looks of Venus,

14:23.451 --> 14:25.318
Eros isn't finished with us yet.

14:25.353 --> 14:26.986
Maybe now would be a good time

14:27.021 --> 14:28.754
for you to tell me why you're here,

14:28.790 --> 14:30.923
with a Martian marine
and your own government

14:30.959 --> 14:32.397
trying to kill you.

14:32.861 --> 14:34.794
I was trying to bring Jules-Pierre Mao

14:34.829 --> 14:36.484
in from the cold.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.632
There are factions
within the UN who are using

14:39.667 --> 14:43.436
the protomolecule as
an excuse to wage this war.

14:43.471 --> 14:45.638
I need you to take me to a safe port.

14:45.673 --> 14:47.373
We're going to Io.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.443
To find someone's daughter,
possibly, I heard.

14:50.478 --> 14:52.945
That's very noble, but I may have a way

14:52.981 --> 14:54.313
to end this conflict.

14:54.349 --> 14:55.581
Have you been watching the news?

14:55.617 --> 14:58.951
- Diplomacy's over.
- I need to send a tight-beam

14:58.987 --> 15:01.153
to Admiral Souther on the Agatha King.

15:01.189 --> 15:02.989
Any tight-beam would
give away our position.

15:03.024 --> 15:05.224
And we already took that risk
rescuing you.

15:05.260 --> 15:06.848
We're not doing it again.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.463
Whatever happened to the man
who risked certain death

15:10.498 --> 15:12.832
- to stop Eros?
- He stopped fighting battles

15:12.867 --> 15:14.166
he knew he couldn't win.

15:14.202 --> 15:16.068
This isn't just about the war.

15:16.104 --> 15:18.404
We need to contain the protomolecule,

15:18.439 --> 15:21.529
make sure it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.911
- You think that's funny?
- Not at all.

15:24.946 --> 15:26.679
It's just that I've heard it before.

15:26.714 --> 15:28.748
- From who?
- Everyone.

15:28.783 --> 15:30.329
Including me.

15:31.953 --> 15:33.791
I met your mother.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.752
Elise.

15:37.191 --> 15:39.892
When everyone else
said you were a terrorist,

15:39.928 --> 15:42.261
I went to find out for myself.

15:42.297 --> 15:43.996
Lovely woman.

15:44.032 --> 15:47.166
She thought I was full of shit,
too, at first.

15:47.201 --> 15:50.058
She's well. Happy for you.

15:50.772 --> 15:52.310
Happy you're free.

15:53.074 --> 15:54.874
She told me when you were a boy,

15:54.909 --> 15:58.274
- you wanted to be a knight.
- That's because I was a boy.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.779
It's no accident you're in
the midst of all this chaos.

16:05.053 --> 16:07.325
I'm nobody's savior.

16:26.943 --> 16:29.344
ID was confirmed Cotyar Ghazi,

16:29.379 --> 16:31.813
Former Sig-Int. currently assigned to

16:31.848 --> 16:35.350
Deputy Undersecretary
Avasarala's security detail.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.519
He's her spy.

16:37.554 --> 16:39.588
Admiral on deck.

16:43.727 --> 16:45.113
At ease.

16:47.864 --> 16:49.965
- Permission to come aboard.
- Of course, sir.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.200
Welcome aboard the Agatha King.
The ship is yours.

16:52.235 --> 16:54.135
That won't be necessary, Admiral.

16:54.171 --> 16:55.421
Are the prisoners secured?

16:55.456 --> 16:57.333
There was only one survivor, sir.

16:58.108 --> 17:01.276
We have him in the med bay. He was shot.

17:09.286 --> 17:10.852
I know this is an unusual visit,

17:10.887 --> 17:12.787
but secrecy was critical.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.089
The Secretary General has
issued an Executive Order

17:15.125 --> 17:16.825
to apprehend Chrisjen Avasarala,

17:16.859 --> 17:18.393
- on suspicion of treason.
- What?

17:18.428 --> 17:20.940
She was conspiring with Jules-Pierre Mao.

17:21.565 --> 17:23.330
Her last known location
was aboard his yacht,

17:23.367 --> 17:26.901
which is now the debris field
you fished the prisoner off of.

17:26.936 --> 17:28.446
Keep this need-to-know.

17:29.039 --> 17:31.200
May I accompany you, sir?

17:32.542 --> 17:33.742
Of course.

17:38.782 --> 17:41.282
- Outside.
- Yes, sir.

17:43.587 --> 17:45.520
Mr. Ghazi, I'm Admiral Souther.

17:45.555 --> 17:47.689
This is Fleet Admiral Nguyen.

17:47.724 --> 17:50.592
Well, you Navy boys sure know
how to roll out the red carpet.

17:50.627 --> 17:53.194
I figured a rock hopper
would be my ride home.

17:53.230 --> 17:55.096
Lucky for me, there's a war going on.

17:55.132 --> 17:57.265
Well, your friend wasn't as lucky.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.267
Explosion shook us pretty good.

17:59.302 --> 18:02.070
Theo didn't get strapped in in time.

18:05.409 --> 18:07.409
- He was a good man.
- Shame.

18:07.444 --> 18:10.573
Seems like the type who'd have
been very cooperative.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.367
Now we only get your story.

18:14.518 --> 18:16.245
Where's Avasarala?

18:17.621 --> 18:19.421
She's dead.

18:19.456 --> 18:22.691
Jules-Pierre Mao's goons executed her.

18:23.827 --> 18:27.595
So she gets killed, but you
still managed to escape.

18:28.932 --> 18:30.598
I find that hard to believe.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.333
We barely got to the drop ship.

18:32.369 --> 18:34.002
It's a miracle.

18:34.037 --> 18:36.237
There's another ship docked
to the Guanshiyin.

18:36.273 --> 18:38.473
A racing pinnace.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.353
The Martian took it.

18:41.044 --> 18:44.813
Those Marines are bad ass, but...

18:44.848 --> 18:47.549
of course you know that
better than anyone.

18:50.387 --> 18:55.156
I think your boss is still alive.

18:55.192 --> 18:57.258
I think she's defecting to Mars.

18:57.294 --> 18:59.127
Well, maybe you should've
called to ask her

18:59.162 --> 19:00.962
before your people blew up
the Guanshiyin.

19:00.997 --> 19:03.298
Are you implying that
UNN forces destroyed

19:03.333 --> 19:06.201
- a civilian yacht?
- I'm not implying shit.

19:07.537 --> 19:12.373
- It's a God damn fact.
- Pathetic.

19:12.409 --> 19:14.275
You're gonna be charged
with treason, too.

19:14.311 --> 19:16.978
Cooperate and you might
avoid a death sentence.

19:17.013 --> 19:19.514
Talk to Errinwright. He's the traitor,

19:19.549 --> 19:22.617
He's been protecting
Jules-Pierre Mao all along.

19:22.652 --> 19:24.619
He can tell you
everything you want to know.

19:24.654 --> 19:26.821
Nice try. Get some rest.

19:26.857 --> 19:28.857
You're gonna need your strength.

19:40.904 --> 19:43.238
These are some preliminary
thoughts for your speech.

19:43.273 --> 19:47.108
The parts about Venus and
people facing the unknown

19:47.144 --> 19:49.878
are fairly solid.

19:49.913 --> 19:51.317
"Throughout our history, we've broadened

19:51.352 --> 19:53.815
"our knowledge of creation,

19:53.850 --> 19:56.151
"deepened our understanding of ourselves,

19:56.186 --> 19:58.720
"discovered profound
connections between each other

19:58.755 --> 20:01.142
and the planets we share."

20:02.225 --> 20:04.459
- Nice cadence at the end.
- It would be more convincing

20:04.494 --> 20:06.828
if we weren't at war.

20:06.863 --> 20:09.831
_

20:11.201 --> 20:14.803
What if instead,
the focus was on defying fear?

20:15.197 --> 20:16.782
Defying fear.

20:17.374 --> 20:18.701
Yes.

20:19.409 --> 20:23.011
We are witnessing the greatest
event in human history.

20:23.046 --> 20:26.848
We should feel something other than fear.

20:26.883 --> 20:28.750
Of it. Of each other.

20:28.785 --> 20:32.720
Of the difficult choices
that we sometimes have to make.

20:32.756 --> 20:34.355
You mean the choices you have to make.

20:34.391 --> 20:37.225
Yes. The necessity of hard choices,

20:37.260 --> 20:39.194
of sacrifice.

20:39.229 --> 20:41.863
Sacrifice literally means to make sacred.

20:41.898 --> 20:43.698
Do you think that's what's going on here?

20:43.733 --> 20:44.977
Yes.

20:45.735 --> 20:47.438
Sacred losses.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.440
You're carrying a burden.

20:52.475 --> 20:55.310
I'm not going to lighten it for you.

20:55.345 --> 20:56.978
Maybe this war was inevitable.

20:57.013 --> 20:59.280
Maybe there was no way to avoid it.

20:59.316 --> 21:02.884
But you want it to be holy, and it's not.

21:02.919 --> 21:06.855
The best you can hope
for is that it's justified.

21:06.890 --> 21:10.124
And if they Mars makes
it a choice between us or them?

21:10.160 --> 21:13.661
Us and them... How many of us?

21:13.697 --> 21:17.565
How many of them? How many sacrifices

21:17.601 --> 21:19.601
can you stomach and still tell yourself

21:19.636 --> 21:20.768
you're doing God's work?

21:20.804 --> 21:22.904
A... a hundred?

21:22.939 --> 21:25.840
A million? A billion?

21:28.178 --> 21:30.578
We both know it's more than 37.

21:32.649 --> 21:36.284
I'm gonna consider that
a rhetorical question.

21:36.319 --> 21:38.219
No. There is an answer.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.490
Oh.

21:40.857 --> 21:44.492
So you know precisely how many
lives a leader must sacrifice

21:44.527 --> 21:46.694
and still be a good man?

21:46.730 --> 21:49.831
Yes. As few as possible.

22:00.343 --> 22:02.513
Are you someone's dad?

22:10.353 --> 22:12.320
No one you would know.

22:12.355 --> 22:14.055
There you are.

22:14.090 --> 22:16.291
I told you to stop running off.

22:16.326 --> 22:18.326
I'm sorry, sir.

22:26.169 --> 22:28.503
Do you work for Dr. Strickland?

22:28.538 --> 22:31.372
No, we work together.

22:31.408 --> 22:34.309
- Like Misko and Marisko?
- Who?

22:34.344 --> 22:36.844
They're dinosaurs. They work together

22:36.880 --> 22:39.147
to help people and stop Count Mungo.

22:39.182 --> 22:41.215
It's my favorite cartoon.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.051
I think my daughters used to watch that

22:43.086 --> 22:45.973
- when they were your age.
- Are they here?

22:46.690 --> 22:47.933
No.

22:48.892 --> 22:50.925
Ah, I got this.

22:50.961 --> 22:54.195
Hey, up you go. Ooh.

22:54.230 --> 22:56.998
Did you see how Katoa jumped really high?

22:57.033 --> 22:59.367
- I did.
- Dr. Strickland says

22:59.402 --> 23:02.036
one day I might be able
to jump like that.

23:02.072 --> 23:03.538
I hope I can.

23:03.573 --> 23:06.207
I wanna show my dad when I see him.

23:07.577 --> 23:10.456
What's your name? Mine's Mei.

23:11.281 --> 23:13.114
- Jules-Pierre.
- Nice to meet you,

23:13.149 --> 23:17.285
- Jules-Pierre.
- Nice to meet you, Mei.

23:26.429 --> 23:28.463
Hey, Hoss. I wanna run a system check

23:28.498 --> 23:31.032
of the Roci's active sensors and comms.

23:31.067 --> 23:32.934
We've been running silent for
a quite a spell now,

23:32.969 --> 23:34.769
and that last battle was a real thumper.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.671
So, I just wanna make sure everything

23:36.706 --> 23:39.209
- is A-okay when we need it.
- All right, make it quick.

23:40.176 --> 23:42.154
Yes, sir.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.320
_

23:58.628 --> 23:59.880
Alex...

24:01.209 --> 24:03.409
we thought you were dead

24:03.600 --> 24:06.637
for so long.

24:07.103 --> 24:09.437
And I'm glad that you're not.

24:09.472 --> 24:11.141
Really, I am.

24:12.042 --> 24:14.687
But you waited too long.

24:15.311 --> 24:18.065
Melas has learned
to live without a father,

24:18.982 --> 24:21.249
and a real husband wouldn't have

24:21.284 --> 24:23.284
done that to his wife.

24:23.319 --> 24:24.786
I'm glad that you have something

24:24.821 --> 24:26.448
more important than us.

24:27.323 --> 24:29.157
Because we don't need you anymore.

24:43.067 --> 24:44.600
Sir, the location

24:44.636 --> 24:47.036
of MCRN Platform number 5
has been confirmed.

24:47.071 --> 24:48.571
What do the simulations say?

24:48.606 --> 24:50.907
Complete success, knocking out all five

24:50.942 --> 24:52.742
before they can launch, 82%

24:52.777 --> 24:53.976
And if they do manage a launch,

24:54.012 --> 24:55.711
what would the casualties be then?

24:55.747 --> 24:57.880
- We estimate it would...
- That's very unlikely.

24:57.916 --> 25:00.483
And our planetary defenses
are in perfect position.

25:00.518 --> 25:04.053
But right now, we have the
advantage of total surprise.

25:04.088 --> 25:05.254
It won't last forever.

25:05.290 --> 25:07.373
But our rail guns are targeted,

25:07.408 --> 25:09.028
warmed up and ready.

25:09.028 --> 25:12.386
All we need is for you
to give the order to fire.

25:13.232 --> 25:16.165
I have a sacred obligation
to the people of this planet.

25:16.969 --> 25:19.203
All we need is for you
82% is not good enough. to fire.

25:19.238 --> 25:21.170
Stand down.

25:26.846 --> 25:28.412
This is ridiculous. I just want

25:28.447 --> 25:29.813
- to talk to everyone...
- If you're gonna walk

25:29.849 --> 25:31.615
around the ship,
you have to wear the boots.

25:31.650 --> 25:34.184
- House rules.
- What?

25:34.220 --> 25:36.487
Do they think I'm just going
to float away?

25:36.522 --> 25:39.063
Don't look at me. This is not my ship.

25:39.658 --> 25:42.993
Okay, lean your foot back to engage it.

25:43.029 --> 25:45.596
Lean back with my weight on my heel?

25:45.631 --> 25:46.779
Yes.

25:48.134 --> 25:49.333
There you go.

25:49.368 --> 25:52.603
Now you just walk around
like you're in pumps.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.138
How do you know what it's like

25:54.173 --> 25:55.439
to walk in pumps?

25:55.474 --> 25:57.581
I didn't always work in space.

26:06.385 --> 26:08.318
This isn't so hard.

26:08.354 --> 26:10.788
Not bad, right?

26:10.823 --> 26:13.590
I'll inform Mars to ready the white flag.

26:39.018 --> 26:41.652
There's half a pan
in the fridge, if you want.

26:43.322 --> 26:45.671
It's all right. I'm not hungry.

26:46.525 --> 26:47.714
Yeah.

26:50.362 --> 26:52.963
Look, Naomi, I... I realize

26:52.998 --> 26:55.466
that things ain't how
they used to be around here.

26:55.501 --> 26:57.599
And, um...

27:00.072 --> 27:01.505
When you were on the Razorback,

27:01.540 --> 27:03.772
I saw you were checking out Tycho.

27:04.610 --> 27:07.377
- You wouldn't understand.
- Well, you're wrong.

27:07.413 --> 27:09.413
I do. I get why you wanna leave.

27:09.448 --> 27:11.348
Don't get me wrong, I'm still mad as hell

27:11.383 --> 27:14.366
that you gave that protoshit
to Fred Johnson, but...

27:15.187 --> 27:18.455
I can't help but respect
your commitment to the Belt.

27:23.229 --> 27:24.928
I wish I had your strength.

27:32.271 --> 27:33.904
Sure you don't want some?

27:33.939 --> 27:36.206
I mean, the cheese ain't real, but...

27:36.242 --> 27:38.265
The love that went into it is.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.178
Okay.

27:41.213 --> 27:42.603
Yeah?

27:44.383 --> 27:46.231
All right, you take this one.

27:48.954 --> 27:51.688
- I'll get another one.
- Thanks.

27:55.161 --> 27:56.909
You're welcome.

28:00.132 --> 28:02.799
I wanted to personally
thank you for helping us.

28:02.835 --> 28:06.770
But more importantly,
to cut out all the bullshit.

28:06.805 --> 28:08.754
I'll go first.

28:09.408 --> 28:11.875
UN Deputy Secretary Errinwright

28:11.911 --> 28:14.378
commissioned Jules-Pierre Mao
to manufacture

28:14.413 --> 28:17.179
protomolecule hybrid soldiers.

28:17.850 --> 28:19.616
The proof is in this.

28:19.652 --> 28:22.586
It would be nice if you could
decrypt and authenticate it.

28:22.621 --> 28:24.821
They field-tested one of
those things on Ganymede.

28:24.857 --> 28:26.423
It wiped out a dozen UN Marines

28:26.458 --> 28:27.558
and my entire Fire Team

28:27.593 --> 28:28.792
without even breaking a sweat.

28:28.827 --> 28:30.460
I believe Errinwright intends

28:30.496 --> 28:33.597
to use the hybrids to lay waste to Mars.

28:33.632 --> 28:35.999
We need your help to stop him.

28:44.510 --> 28:45.943
Show cargo bay surveillance

28:45.978 --> 28:48.001
of hybrid incursion.

28:49.014 --> 28:51.181
We encountered one on Ganymede.

28:51.217 --> 28:54.418
It got onto our ship,
almost killed us all.

28:54.453 --> 28:56.520
We killed it instead.

28:56.555 --> 28:59.990
Wait, you guys fought
one of those things and won?

29:00.025 --> 29:01.391
How?

29:01.427 --> 29:03.594
Burned it up in our drive plume.

29:03.629 --> 29:06.129
We believe they're
producing the Hybrids on Io.

29:06.165 --> 29:08.031
A pediatrician is using
children with a rare

29:08.067 --> 29:10.399
immune deficiency to create them.

29:11.237 --> 29:12.803
My daughter is one of the kids.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.028
I hope you find her.

29:15.507 --> 29:18.442
What do you intend to do
if you find other things?

29:18.477 --> 29:21.545
Like scientists, data cores, a sample of

29:21.580 --> 29:24.514
- the protomolecule itself?
- We shoot the scientists

29:24.550 --> 29:26.039
and nuke the rest.

29:26.752 --> 29:28.518
Speaking for myself.

29:28.554 --> 29:29.553
Based on your track record,

29:29.588 --> 29:31.455
I think you'd be inclined to give

29:31.490 --> 29:33.323
the whole lot to the Belt.

29:33.359 --> 29:35.259
They don't need it.

29:35.294 --> 29:37.718
Fred Johnson already has a sample.

29:38.764 --> 29:42.299
How could you be so freaking
stupid to give it to the OPA?

29:42.334 --> 29:44.057
He didn't.

29:44.837 --> 29:46.518
I did.

29:47.273 --> 29:48.872
I'd say cry me a river

29:48.907 --> 29:51.908
if I thought you could
appreciate what one was.

29:51.944 --> 29:55.212
If good Belters ever stood up
and defied the OPA

29:55.247 --> 29:57.347
instead of letting them
speak for all of you,

29:57.383 --> 29:58.882
perhaps you'd deserve respect.

29:58.917 --> 30:02.019
We're not the ones doing the killing now.

30:02.054 --> 30:04.821
Earth and Mars have the protomolecule.

30:04.857 --> 30:07.524
The Belt has the right to it as well.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.594
In that case,

30:10.629 --> 30:12.836
we should nuke Io.

30:15.067 --> 30:17.868
I told you we want the same things.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.537
Maybe now you'll believe me.

30:29.674 --> 30:31.441
Thought you'd left.

30:31.477 --> 30:33.143
Have a drink.

30:33.178 --> 30:34.811
Thank you, sir.

30:34.847 --> 30:37.319
- How's the speech coming?
- Good.

30:37.750 --> 30:40.450
Anna knows how
to reach the best in people.

30:40.486 --> 30:44.154
This speech could well
define my term in office.

30:44.189 --> 30:46.161
Well, that's a shame.

30:47.026 --> 30:49.059
- Excuse me?
- I understand why

30:49.094 --> 30:52.396
you canceled the strike,
but with all due respect,

30:52.431 --> 30:54.131
that was the moment to write your legacy,

30:54.166 --> 30:57.501
- not some speech.
- You're being short sighted.

30:57.536 --> 31:00.237
Leaders aren't just remembered
for the wars they win.

31:00.272 --> 31:01.238
No, they're remembered for

31:01.273 --> 31:03.840
how they moved civilizations forward.

31:03.876 --> 31:05.847
This isn't about defeating Mars.

31:06.478 --> 31:08.642
It's about what's happening on Venus.

31:09.782 --> 31:13.650
Eros proved that no one
on this planet's safe anymore.

31:13.686 --> 31:15.085
And we need to end this because

31:15.120 --> 31:18.188
we don't know who
or what our next enemy is.

31:18.223 --> 31:21.458
And if the thought
of casualties scares you now,

31:21.493 --> 31:23.627
imagine another Eros,

31:23.662 --> 31:25.742
one that we can't even stop.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.334
If you end this war,

31:30.369 --> 31:31.902
you'll be remembered as the man

31:31.937 --> 31:35.168
who united humanity
in the face of first contact.

31:35.908 --> 31:38.809
And that's a legacy you don't
need anyone else to write.

31:56.195 --> 31:59.663
- What's going on?
- Katoa!

31:59.698 --> 32:00.831
He's okay.

32:00.866 --> 32:02.279
He's gonna be fine.

32:06.605 --> 32:07.971
Katoa.

32:30.262 --> 32:32.229
So I understand we're still
having electrical problems

32:32.264 --> 32:34.831
- on decks 2, 3, and 11.
- 11, no, sir.

32:34.867 --> 32:36.666
And 2 and 3 are fixed.

32:36.702 --> 32:40.192
How long do you think
the systems will be down on 11?

32:40.806 --> 32:44.674
Uh... everything should be
back up and running

32:44.710 --> 32:47.282
in about 20 minutes.

32:47.780 --> 32:49.576
That'll be perfect.

32:50.048 --> 32:51.870
Lieutenant.

33:11.804 --> 33:14.538
Electrical fire down on 15.
All hands needed.

33:14.573 --> 33:16.072
Sir, I'm not supposed
to leave the prisoner.

33:16.108 --> 33:18.375
He's chained to his bed. You're with me.

33:27.252 --> 33:28.919
We have new orders, Lieutenant.

33:28.954 --> 33:31.721
- Lay in a course for Io.
- What's in Io, sir?

33:31.757 --> 33:33.490
That's classified.

33:33.525 --> 33:36.726
- Yes, sir.
- What's the problem?

33:36.762 --> 33:39.663
Electrical issues.
The Agatha's showing her age.

33:39.698 --> 33:42.132
Repairs are underway.
Shouldn't take long.

33:42.167 --> 33:44.130
Where is Admiral Souther?

33:45.370 --> 33:47.509
I believe he's in his quarters, sir.

33:48.207 --> 33:50.507
Which decks are experiencing
electrical issues?

33:50.542 --> 33:52.075
2, 3 and 11, sir.

33:52.110 --> 33:53.849
Med bay's on 11.

34:00.118 --> 34:02.152
I rarely agreed with your
boss or her methods.

34:02.187 --> 34:04.354
She's a ruthless son of a bitch.

34:04.389 --> 34:05.527
But she's also a patriot.

34:05.563 --> 34:07.023
She'd die before betraying Earth.

34:07.059 --> 34:08.612
So talk fast.

34:09.695 --> 34:11.574
What really happened on that ship?

34:14.166 --> 34:17.333
Avasarala made a secret deal
to bring Jules-Pierre Mao in.

34:17.369 --> 34:19.768
In exchange for immunity,
he was going to testify

34:19.804 --> 34:21.605
that he and Errinwright
had been colluding

34:21.639 --> 34:23.639
to develop the protomolecule
into a weapon,

34:23.675 --> 34:27.716
and would turn over all data to
the UN instead of the Martians.

34:28.347 --> 34:30.179
Errinwright turned the tables
on all of us.

34:30.215 --> 34:32.804
That means Nguyen's been
working with him.

34:33.552 --> 34:36.056
Avasarala isn't dead, is she?

34:36.588 --> 34:38.554
She got off the yacht
with the Martian Marine.

34:38.590 --> 34:40.896
I don't know what happened after that.

34:41.426 --> 34:44.226
- Can you prove any of this?
- No.

34:44.263 --> 34:47.163
But Errinwright sent
a message admitting everything.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.195
And Avasarala has it.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.408
She said you were an honorable man.

34:58.443 --> 35:01.711
This war was built on a lie.

35:01.747 --> 35:03.780
Are you gonna do something about it?

35:13.191 --> 35:15.458
Find that guard. I wanna talk to him.

35:20.232 --> 35:22.854
Could you kill the lights again, please?

35:24.269 --> 35:27.037
I'm trying to get the rest
you said I need.

35:40.537 --> 35:43.339
I've decided to take you up
on your offer, Admiral.

35:43.374 --> 35:44.874
- Sir?
- I'm relieving you of command.

35:44.909 --> 35:47.009
The Agatha King is now mine.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.927
Don't make me relieve you
of duty as well.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.420
Of course, sir. The deck is yours.

36:03.694 --> 36:06.095
Rail guns designated 1 through 5

36:06.130 --> 36:07.930
report green for go, sir.

36:07.965 --> 36:10.299
All targets locked
for simultaneous impact.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.657
On your command, sir.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.842
Fire.

36:23.381 --> 36:25.080
One away. Track is good.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.584
One is away.

36:27.718 --> 36:29.337
Two is away.

36:31.222 --> 36:32.924
Three is away.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.511
Four is away.

36:38.596 --> 36:40.529
Five showing red. Failure to launch.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.464
- What's happening?
- I... I'm just checking, sir.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.270
- Check incoming.
- What the hell's going on?

36:45.736 --> 36:48.237
We have a launch malfunction on five.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.705
They need to shoot, God damn it.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.234
Yes, sir.

36:53.411 --> 36:55.511
Five is away.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.795
Target one is scratched.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.097
Scratch two.

37:15.132 --> 37:17.333
Scratch three.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.702
Scratch four.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.408
Scratch five.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.346
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done.

37:30.381 --> 37:31.814
- Thank you.
- We have a confirmed launch

37:31.849 --> 37:33.415
from target five.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.784
They got one off before we hit them.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.697
Jesus Christ.

38:21.065 --> 38:22.531
Status.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.901
Impact in South America. Tip of Amazonia.

38:25.936 --> 38:28.070
Closest city to ground zero is...

38:28.105 --> 38:29.738
Goías Maior.

38:29.774 --> 38:31.173
Total population in the blast zone

38:31.208 --> 38:32.574
approximately 2 million.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.743
What happened with the rail guns?

38:34.779 --> 38:37.079
It was a power cycling malfunction.

38:37.114 --> 38:40.260
From charging up and
standing down earlier, sir.

38:40.851 --> 38:43.652
Watchtowers have detected
no other launches.

38:43.688 --> 38:44.887
Sat-com believes we have eliminated

38:44.922 --> 38:47.956
the MCR's first strike capability.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.683
The subject has been placed in isolation.

39:14.719 --> 39:18.173
The rest, sedated. They're
asleep in their quarters.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.923
I'm sorry you had to see that.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.427
Stop.

39:23.728 --> 39:25.027
Sir?

39:25.062 --> 39:27.599
Stop what you're doing to the children.

39:28.299 --> 39:32.034
Sir, these experiments have
lead to the only real success

39:32.069 --> 39:34.436
we've had in controlling
the protomolecule.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.205
I wanted that to be true.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.874
- I was grasping at straws.
- We are on the verge

39:38.909 --> 39:42.244
- of so much more.
- We're torturing children.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.580
We're creating killing machines.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.081
And we're still light years away

39:46.117 --> 39:48.450
from even beginning to comprehend that.

39:48.486 --> 39:50.819
What we are doing is hard.

39:50.855 --> 39:54.957
We have to be strong,
and great men are strong.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.392
That's how they accomplish great things.

39:56.427 --> 39:58.546
It's not up for debate.

39:59.196 --> 40:02.164
The experiment is over. Shut it down.

40:13.844 --> 40:16.064
Who's responsible for that?

40:16.714 --> 40:18.313
Me.

40:20.317 --> 40:23.819
I'm not unsympathetic
to the plight of Belters.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.921
I know the OPA doesn't speak for you all.

40:25.956 --> 40:27.623
Save your breath.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.535
We're not gonna be friends.

40:30.528 --> 40:33.331
That doesn't mean we have to be enemies.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.931
There's an old Belter joke

40:35.966 --> 40:38.500
How can you tell when an Inner's lying?

40:38.536 --> 40:41.670
- When their mouth's...
- When their mouth is moving.

40:41.705 --> 40:44.973
And it's not much of a joke, really.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.177
You might be able to fool the others,

40:48.212 --> 40:50.223
but I know what you're doing.

40:51.015 --> 40:53.649
What I'm doing is trying to stop this war

40:53.684 --> 40:55.350
from getting worse.

40:55.386 --> 40:58.554
You're not going to Io
to destroy the protomolecule.

40:58.589 --> 41:01.523
You're going because Earth
doesn't have a sample,

41:01.559 --> 41:04.159
and you need one to stay in the game.

41:05.696 --> 41:07.463
The only reason I'm still on this ship

41:07.498 --> 41:09.701
is to make sure you don't get it.

41:10.835 --> 41:15.971
You're right.
We're not going to be friends.

41:23.714 --> 41:24.746
Which covers a radius

41:24.782 --> 41:27.015
of nearly 11 kilometers.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.718
The South American Emergency
Response Directorate

41:29.753 --> 41:31.620
has begun sending workers in,

41:31.655 --> 41:33.856
though they say that fires
and radioactive fallout

41:33.891 --> 41:36.592
will make rescue efforts
extremely dangerous.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.327
Drone cameras have begun recording

41:38.362 --> 41:40.529
dramatic footage of the impact site.

41:40.564 --> 41:43.098
Warning: the following
images are graphic.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.334
You know what makes this worse?

41:45.369 --> 41:47.503
What could be worse?

41:47.538 --> 41:49.324
Didn't need to happen.

41:50.741 --> 41:52.674
We had a military option earlier today

41:52.710 --> 41:55.377
that would've prevented it.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.746
But there were risks and costs,

41:57.781 --> 42:01.252
which the Secretary General
was unwilling to take.

42:02.553 --> 42:05.089
If only he hadn't wavered.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.460
But it's good that you're here, though.

42:15.599 --> 42:18.867
He's going to need you now
more than ever.
