<i>And so, ladies and gentlemen,
we come to our final item,</i>

00:35.200 --> 00:39.433
<i>a 1937 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic,</i>

00:39.560 --> 00:41.756
<i>one of only two in the world.</i>

00:41.840 --> 00:44.799
<i>I could take the time
to further describe this absolute gem,</i>

00:44.880 --> 00:45.996
<i>but you wouldn't be here today</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:48.640
<i>if you hadn't been dreaming
about this car your entire life.</i>

00:48.720 --> 00:50.518
<i>Bidding starts at $30 million.</i>

00:50.960 --> 00:52.030
<i>$30 million, anybody?</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:55.677
<i>Thank you, madam. $30 million. Do I hear 32?</i>

00:55.760 --> 00:58.150
<i>$32 million. Thank you, sir.</i>

00:58.240 --> 00:59.674
<i>Thirty-four, anyone?</i>

00:59.760 --> 01:01.274
<i>Thirty-four, on the telephone.</i>

01:02.160 --> 01:04.800
<i>Thirty-six, anybody? Thirty-six.</i>

01:04.879 --> 01:07.475
<i>Thirty-six over there. Thirty-eight.
Do I have 38?</i>

01:07.560 --> 01:08.596
<i>Thirty-seven, if you like.</i>

01:08.680 --> 01:11.070
What do you think? This is the one?

01:11.920 --> 01:13.400
<i>Thirty-seven. Thank you, sir.</i>

01:13.480 --> 01:14.596
<i>Thirty-seven over there.</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:16.832
- Here.
- <i>$38 million, on the telephone.</i>

01:17.400 --> 01:19.790
<i>Thirty-nine, in the room. Thank you, sir.</i>

01:20.480 --> 01:23.040
<i>$40 million. $40 million.</i>

01:23.160 --> 01:25.914
<i>Going once, going twice...</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:28.390
<i>Final call at $40 million...</i>

01:28.480 --> 01:29.755
<i>$41 million.</i>

01:29.840 --> 01:31.911
<i>$41 million, I have a bid.</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:34.674
<i>Going once, going twice...</i>

01:34.760 --> 01:37.229
<i>Sold for $41 million.</i>

01:37.320 --> 01:40.119
<i>Congratulations. The car is yours, sir.</i>

01:43.880 --> 01:45.234
Come on.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.234
Come on.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.676
Come on, Gabriela. Call me.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.318
That phone's not gonna ring.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.436
You don't know that.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.672
I'm on a bridge in the South of France

01:58.760 --> 02:03.040
instead of on a beach in Brazil, counting
our money, because you fell for the mark.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.358
I didn't fall, okay?

02:06.960 --> 02:10.112
If you look around,
and you don't know who the mark is,

02:10.600 --> 02:11.590
then it's you.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.837
That Ferrari is not coming back.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.515
You were played by a very bad girl.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.515
She'll call.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.110
She'll call.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.114
Can we focus, please?

02:26.720 --> 02:27.995
I do love the bad girls, though.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.116
Focus.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.919
All right, I heard you the first time.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.196
I bet you did, with those big-ass ears.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.239
There's nothing wrong with my ears.
I've got Dad's ears.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.352
That's us. You got this?

02:42.760 --> 02:43.750
Yeah. Do you?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.320
You might need more of a running start.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.595
You're gonna tell me how to do my job, now?

02:47.680 --> 02:49.831
I'm just saying, one more step
might make all the difference.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.910
Just drive.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.790
Seriously?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.390
Okay.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.910
Hey, brother.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.470
I should be driving.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.595
You're flooding it, man.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.196
Cutting the brakes? Really?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.511
- That was your decision?
- I saved your ass back there.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.472
You should learn to be kinder
to your brother.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.716
- Half-brother.
- Yeah.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.315
We were trying not to draw
attention to ourselves.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.710
You know, I usually take
your general shit attitude towards me

06:20.800 --> 06:23.554
as a thinly-veiled cry for help,
but not today, brother,

06:23.640 --> 06:27.714
because this beauty is our first step
to getting flush.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.355
- Look, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Hi, Garrett.

08:08.560 --> 08:11.917
You climbed out of our bed,
tip-toed over the floor,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.196
and left me there to steal that car.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.396
We are a team.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.197
You can't sideline me on this one.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.077
Well, I tried to convince him,
but he wasn't having any of it.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.195
I'll give you a minute.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.716
- Yeah.
- Steph...

08:27.040 --> 08:28.997
You've got to let me in, Andrew.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.475
All the way in.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.679
Just tell me, "You got it."

08:36.760 --> 08:37.876
You got it.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.796
Come on.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.314
Let's toast to Marseille.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.390
Damn right, baby.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.154
Yeah, if jackass over here
can learn how to follow a plan.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.391
Come on! Your plan was to hang off
the side of a truck.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.551
If only your dad could see you right now.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.276
Here we go.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.560
Did I ever tell you about the time
I changed the oil on that '62 Ferrari?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.359
Terrible impression of Dad.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.320
Greatest goddamn day
a grease jockey like me ever had.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.517
See, I heard the Ferrari before I saw it.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.720
Felt it shake the floor of the garage.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.393
He's not gonna stop.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.552
The body was like that of an elegant woman.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.233
The paint, a perfect red. The oil...

09:25.320 --> 09:27.312
We've really got to get him a girl.

09:28.800 --> 09:33.079
For a few hours,
everything felt right in the world.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.552
And then, like a vision, it was gone.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.040
Okay. Time for bed, old man.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.270
Fine.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.680
Bye.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.755
- Get some sleep. I'm serious.
- Yeah.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.876
We've got a car to fence in the morning.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.680
Yeah, you're right.
We should call it a night.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.430
Or...

09:59.280 --> 10:04.674
So, what was that you were saying
about "all the way in"?

10:22.840 --> 10:24.160
Beautiful.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.873
You have delivered the dream.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.193
That's the Foster guarantee.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.475
When I told you I wanted this car,

10:40.560 --> 10:43.359
I didn't say I wanted it stolen
from a madman.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.796
Let's be clear about that.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.114
Well, we don't ask you
where you get your money.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.317
Don't ask us where we get our cars.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.076
But sometimes, you upset
the wrong guy and you find trouble.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.237
Well, then don't upset us.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.469
Look. Come on, now, all right?
This is just business.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.911
You ordered a classic, Mr. Panahi,
and we delivered on time.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.435
If you just pay us, we'll be on our way.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.639
I swear,

11:54.760 --> 11:58.037
I had no idea who the car belonged to.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.713
I would never have...

12:18.320 --> 12:19.720
Do you know who I am?

12:22.600 --> 12:27.318
Nope, but I'm pretty sure the last time
a guy wearing an ascot got laid was 1972.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.516
So you're brothers?

12:42.560 --> 12:44.836
Yeah, he's my brother from another mother.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.673
Literally. Look.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.510
Never mind.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.150
Would you like to know who I am?

12:53.960 --> 12:57.476
If you look to the west,
just where the lake meets the shore...

12:59.280 --> 13:00.680
Right at the tip, you see?

13:02.320 --> 13:04.835
About 200 meters from there
is where I was born.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.354
The house I lived in was
no bigger than a storage shed.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.192
My mother worked for a fishmonger,

13:12.280 --> 13:16.274
cleaning up scales and blood and gills
until her fingers went raw.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.760
She was stooped over
as long as I ever knew her.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.714
I didn't want to hug her,
the way she smelled.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.675
Can you imagine not wanting
to hug your own mother?

13:34.800 --> 13:38.316
My father worked for a man
who restored antique hunting rifles

13:38.400 --> 13:39.993
until the day he died.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.359
I learned all about underlever,
exposed hammers, Whelen barrels,

13:45.160 --> 13:46.514
express sights

13:47.120 --> 13:48.349
before I could walk.

13:49.920 --> 13:53.960
When he died, I started stealing wallets
from the sailors in Marseille.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.679
Made quite a living.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.232
Kept expanding my operation.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.192
And now, I'm the biggest
black-tar importer in southern Europe.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.556
And a collector of all that is rare.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.800
And beautiful.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.796
Untie them.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.590
I wanna show you more beauties.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.475
Is that the Alfa Romeo 158?

14:52.560 --> 14:55.394
Yes, it was driven by Juan Manuel Fangio.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.712
This car finished first
in the 1950 Monte Carlo Grand Prix?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.390
Perceptive.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.357
Dodge 6 with right-handed steering?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.636
It was altered for Al Capone himself.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.040
Very convenient for a drive-by.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.518
Corvette C1.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.637
'64 Shelby Cobra.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.473
You got an Austin-Healey,

15:16.320 --> 15:17.993
a Jaguar Type-E,

15:18.080 --> 15:21.278
and a BMW 327,

15:21.360 --> 15:23.079
and an Aston Martin!

15:23.680 --> 15:24.909
- '70?
- '69.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.593
'67 Mustang.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.319
Porsche 356.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.680
Jaguar XK120.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.320
Exactly right.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.670
Right.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.030
- You're...
- Jacomo Morier.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.670
Oh, dear.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.190
Yeah.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.274
Entirety of my life
has been invested in these cars.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.878
They're a constant reminder of how far
I've come and how far I intend to go.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.590
That motherless freak Panahi thieved from me,

15:56.920 --> 15:58.639
which means you thieved from me.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.997
Mr. Morier, we had no idea this was your car.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.039
We just thought it was purchased
at auction and passing through Marseille.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.830
Ignorance of a crime against a man
is no excuse for the crime itself.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.550
Wait, wait, wait.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.518
Look, Mr. Morier, maybe there's
something we can do for you,

16:12.600 --> 16:13.636
- you know?
- Garrett...

16:13.720 --> 16:14.676
Make things square. He's gonna shoot us.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.433
- You're not helping.
- Max Klemp.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.558
- Max Klemp?
- Max Klemp.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.560
Look, either we cut him in,
or there's nothing to cut.

16:25.640 --> 16:26.676
Cut me into what?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.596
Okay. Max Klemp.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.750
Max Klemp was a third-generation
heavy out of West Berlin.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.912
<i>Born with a silver spoon in his mouth.</i>

16:49.120 --> 16:51.555
<i>Turns out he was the smart one in the family</i>

16:52.000 --> 16:56.631
<i>because at age 15, he started his MBA
at the University of Munich,</i>

16:56.720 --> 16:58.871
<i>seven years younger than any other student.</i>

16:58.960 --> 17:03.000
<i>At age 20, he proved himself
not only brilliant with numbers</i>

17:03.080 --> 17:05.356
<i>but capable of taking over
the family business</i>

17:05.440 --> 17:08.000
<i>in his own unique way.</i>

17:23.280 --> 17:26.990
<i>At age 30, his father handed him
the reins to the empire,</i>

17:28.680 --> 17:33.038
<i>and to celebrate the event,
he gave him a gift.</i>

17:36.560 --> 17:40.236
<i>A 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO,</i>

17:40.320 --> 17:43.996
<i>today worth roughly $38 million.</i>

17:51.520 --> 17:55.992
We were gonna steal it from them
here in Marseille.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.675
It's our plan.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.470
You know him?

18:05.240 --> 18:06.515
Klemp.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.111
I know the bastard
better than he knows himself.

18:11.480 --> 18:15.080
He crossed me on an important real estate
deal in Berlin, which cost me dearly.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.516
He took Torino, Naples, Monaco,

18:17.600 --> 18:23.196
and then he decided to take something
else from me, something priceless.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.833
Marseille. But Marseille is mine.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.640
Well, sounds as if you
don't like him very much.

18:35.040 --> 18:39.398
So, you say you're going to steal
that '62 Ferrari

18:40.000 --> 18:42.151
right out of his compound.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.756
That is impossible.

18:43.840 --> 18:44.956
You let us go,

18:46.200 --> 18:49.159
and we can bring you Max Klemp's
most prized possession.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.872
Look, it's not just a car, Mr. Morier.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.354
It's his legacy.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.590
What do you say?

19:13.680 --> 19:14.670
You have one week.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.951
A week? We're gonna need longer than that.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.350
Drop them back in Marseille.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.159
We've never planned a job
inside a week before.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.675
We're in Marseille.
We can't crew up that fast.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.752
- Shit.
- What?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.075
What's that?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.916
- I'm gonna ask Steph to marry me.
- Now?

19:45.440 --> 19:46.635
- Yeah.
- Really?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.516
That's great. I'm happy for you.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.831
I mean, she deserves better, but still.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.358
I'm taking the piss, all right?

19:55.440 --> 19:56.920
I want the best for you, brother.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.111
- So you're okay with this?
- Of course.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.397
- It's just...
- Here we go.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.278
It's a genuine concern.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.595
You get married. You have a kid.
The whole thing goes tits-up.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.909
And I'm left holding the bag.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.195
We can't do this forever.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.794
But we can't stop in our prime.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.439
I'm sure Stephanie would agree with me.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.757
What did Dad say to us
when he brought us together?

20:22.840 --> 20:25.878
"You missed the first 15 years of being
friends. Don't miss the next 50."

20:25.960 --> 20:27.679
So let's get back on our feet

20:28.480 --> 20:29.914
and do what we do best.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.475
Garrett, after this job, I'm done.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.590
You're joking.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.037
When were you thinking of telling me?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.875
Just did.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.834
- Where have you been?
- Honey, just...

21:04.520 --> 21:06.079
You scared the hell out of me.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.316
Could really get used to this.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.235
I called you all day.
You didn't answer the phone.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.350
Why are you wet?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.033
We had a slight problem.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.074
What kind of problem?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.720
The kind where people are shot off roofs.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.035
What?

21:23.880 --> 21:25.792
- Shot off roofs?
- I'm fine.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.317
But this is why I don't
want you in on this one.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.313
There's always a risk involved, Andrew.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.993
That's part of the job.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.275
There's a place for her, Andrew.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.156
Out of the question. Not with these guys.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.279
Sweet. It's like my own private telenovela.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.191
You didn't tell her we've only got one week.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.315
This is why you need me.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.710
Plus, we're gonna need a crew
if we're gonna pull off a job like this.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.951
Exactly what I thought.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.271
I got a friend here in Marseille.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.477
She can help us get the people we need.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.233
- What?
- Relax.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.356
She's great. She taught me a lot.
She's a fisherman.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.635
No, I said "crew," Steph.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.076
I'm not sure a fisherman
is exactly what we're looking for.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.836
That's 'cause I haven't told you
what she fishes for.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.712
<i>And how do you know this friend, exactly?</i>

22:12.800 --> 22:15.713
<i>Let's just say that neither of us
are welcome in any casino</i>

22:15.800 --> 22:16.950
<i>this side of Amsterdam.</i>

22:26.840 --> 22:28.718
Yeah, we don't speak French. Sorry.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.837
- Okay. You can pole me.
- I don't want...

22:30.920 --> 22:32.479
Then come...

22:32.560 --> 22:35.200
Check your valuables, sir.
This woman is a known thief.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.435
No, I'm okay.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.639
Here she comes.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.480
She's single.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.040
She's a thief.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.349
We're thieves, smart guy.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.435
Devin.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.076
So good to see you.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.872
- So, this is Andrew.
- Hi.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.917
- And this is Garrett.
- Hello.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.111
You having a little trouble with the police?

23:10.280 --> 23:11.270
No trouble.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.513
Call me.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.995
Get back here!

23:20.640 --> 23:21.790
- Stop!
- Get back here!

23:25.400 --> 23:26.629
It's not bad.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.355
She's in.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.757
So the bump is important, but the
misdirection of the target is the key.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.516
And now you can rob poor tourists together.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.595
Stop.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.353
Get them thinking about one thing
before you bump them.

23:46.440 --> 23:49.751
Like, say, "Excuse me, do you have the time?"

23:50.320 --> 23:51.356
No, you don't.

23:51.440 --> 23:55.599
Would another good example of a misdirect
be to get someone to fall in love with you,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.195
steal their stuff,
and then leave while they're asleep?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.230
Brazil, Brazil.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.198
Yeah, that would work really well.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.430
Leon.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.235
Leon.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.835
What did you bring me, you thief?

24:35.720 --> 24:36.836
Your favorite.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.120
First, you have to prove to my friends
how good you are at blowing things up.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.872
Open the safe without harming the pastries,

24:50.960 --> 24:52.030
and they're yours.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.000
All right, get out of the way.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.750
Should we...

25:23.400 --> 25:24.834
I promise, he's good.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.280
I just got him a little excited. It was...

25:26.360 --> 25:27.396
He's in.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.752
- He's in?
- Yup. We don't have time to be picky.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.358
Not this time. No.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.800
I wanna focus on the job.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.472
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.436
Yes.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.514
Anyway, I think we should be more concerned

25:57.600 --> 25:59.956
about how we're gonna
work this from the inside.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.274
I wanna do that.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.277
I'm the last one anyone would expect.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.469
Steph...

26:08.520 --> 26:09.749
What?

26:11.320 --> 26:12.310
Can I talk to you for a sec?

26:25.520 --> 26:27.034
What's the matter with you?

26:28.080 --> 26:29.799
How many times
are we gonna have the same fight?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.758
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.994
So let me get this straight.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.151
You've risked my life in the past,
but now you won't.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.270
- Yeah.
- Is that it?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.760
- Yes, that's right.
- Why?

26:38.840 --> 26:40.274
Because we're together now?

26:40.360 --> 26:42.352
- I haven't changed.
- I have.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.669
You know I can handle it.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.358
Andrew, shutting me out

26:47.080 --> 26:51.040
and trying to protect me
like one of those cars, it won't work.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.358
I know you're afraid to lose me,
but this is the life we chose.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.033
Don't you see that?

27:23.120 --> 27:25.077
So, tell me, what happened in Brazil?

27:25.160 --> 27:26.640
- It doesn't matter.
- I'd like to know.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.474
- No. No, please. Allow me.
- Andrew.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.913
You see, we were finishing a job.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.516
- Don't.
- '61 California Spider. It was beautiful.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.638
We had the car, and the night
we negotiate the deal with the buyers,

27:38.760 --> 27:41.559
Gabriela lets little Garrett hit it.

27:42.760 --> 27:47.391
The next morning, Gabriela's gone,
and so is the Ferrari.

27:48.960 --> 27:49.996
Screwed two times.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.230
Not quite.

27:51.320 --> 27:56.475
Actually, while I was recovering,
Andrew saw the car leave at dawn.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.119
He could have chased it. I know I would have.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.316
The road was blocked.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.357
Which is why you should have done
the Riviera Run.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.476
- What?
- Yeah.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.711
- What, did you just make that up?
- Yup.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.440
It's catchy.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.512
- What's that?
- Riviera Run?

28:08.600 --> 28:09.716
Okay.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.360
So you're holding the throttle while
mashing the brake at the same time.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.669
It's not as easy as it sounds, okay?

28:14.080 --> 28:15.275
Too much pressure, and the engine stalls.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.113
Too little, and you lose speed.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.600
And then, when you let it go...

28:20.160 --> 28:21.389
Riviera Run.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.873
That doesn't actually work.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.314
Yes, it does. You didn't try it.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.436
You weren't there.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.590
Stop.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.716
So that's it?

28:34.800 --> 28:37.076
You don't get involved with girls
on jobs anymore?

28:40.360 --> 28:42.272
I think you should dance with me.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.478
Yeah? Only if you give me
my phone back first.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.960
It's not gonna ring.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.670
They're good.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.556
Really good.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.832
You have friends that can drive like that?

29:53.720 --> 29:54.710
So what's your plan?

29:55.720 --> 29:57.074
Don't need one.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.753
Got to be able to adapt.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.078
- Just start low.
- Yeah, I know what to do.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.310
Garrett, let me help you with this.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.470
- These people...
- No, thanks.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.517
Fair, but firm. That's what I always do.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.316
I don't steal from people
who don't have it coming.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.629
Fine. Be my guest.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.720
Who wants bouillabaisse?

30:17.680 --> 30:19.000
I'm buying.

30:21.040 --> 30:25.034
We're prepared to pay you each
€1,000 for your driving services.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.510
All right, then.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.270
You know the way out.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.389
Look, you guys need to counter.
That's how this works.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.437
Otherwise, I don't know
where your heads are, so...

30:45.280 --> 30:47.795
Okay, then.
Just a little bit of help, please.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.470
Five grand. It's my final offer.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.550
What?

31:04.960 --> 31:05.996
They don't speak English?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.273
I tried to tell you, but...

31:10.840 --> 31:11.910
You knew about this, didn't you?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.195
No.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.274
You're a wanker.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.951
- Five grand.
- We're good, then.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.036
Of course. Always.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.554
That's women for you!

31:31.200 --> 31:32.190
Who's that?

31:32.840 --> 31:34.638
Who are you?

31:35.400 --> 31:37.631
You're gonna swing that thing? Go ahead.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.040
Except I understand you wanna get in
with Max Klemp.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.314
I can help with that.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.832
I asked you a question.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.076
My name is Laurent.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.277
- Well, this was lovely, Laurent.
- Morier.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.319
Laurent Morier.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.835
I'm Jacomo Morier's first cousin.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.115
I believe you had a nice day
of skeet shooting with him.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.949
He asked me to join up with you.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.838
Help you with whatever you have planned.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.433
So, you mean, spy on us
and report back to him.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.510
Exactly.

32:10.840 --> 32:15.437
Let me ask you, who is your contact
inside Max Klemp's organization?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.036
I'll tell you.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.790
It's me.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.360
How?

32:22.840 --> 32:24.399
I know a guy who knows a guy.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.192
<i>The guy I know is Kuhn.</i>

32:30.280 --> 32:32.317
<i>Does dirty work for Klemp</i>

32:33.320 --> 32:35.357
<i>but he cannot ignore an easy score.</i>

32:44.160 --> 32:45.480
Mr. Kuhn.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.354
What the hell do you want, Laurent Morier?

32:55.880 --> 32:57.917
I have a business proposition
you might be interested in.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.072
And what's your cousin think
of you being here?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.790
What my cousin doesn't know
is what my cousin doesn't know.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.398
- What are your names?
- Foster.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.157
I'm Garrett, and this is my brother, Andrew.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.038
That's cute. Who's in charge?

33:12.120 --> 33:13.440
- I am.
- I am.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.755
I got this one, boys.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.757
Okay, here's the deal.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.512
These guys are the two best drivers
in the business.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.751
We can steal anything with an engine.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.480
Armored trucks, high-end delivery vans...

33:27.560 --> 33:29.791
- Why don't we just show you?
- Wait.

33:30.480 --> 33:34.235
If we pull a job for you,
we get an introduction.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.033
- To whom?
- Max Klemp.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.160
I don't know Max Klemp.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.594
Come on.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.800
Well, that's too bad.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.629
Wait.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.960
Here. Hold that.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.313
Now he's just showing off.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.795
Get back in here.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.396
Are you done yet?

34:36.320 --> 34:37.514
Good.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.274
But enough games. Take a look out there.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.717
See that cargo plane?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.998
It's a vehicle with an engine, right?

34:47.400 --> 34:48.754
I want you to stop it.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.830
Now.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.596
What?

34:51.679 --> 34:53.797
Listen, that's not what we meant.

34:53.880 --> 34:57.669
If that plane takes off,
then you can forget about Max Klemp.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.394
- Garrett?
- Yeah.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.040
- <i>You see that plane about to take off?</i>
- Yeah.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.236
Don't let it.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.116
Really?

35:16.440 --> 35:17.556
Where are you going?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.036
To watch you.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.793
What the hell are you doing?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.872
We've got a plane to catch.

35:24.960 --> 35:26.519
You can watch from right here.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.397
Stop! Stop!

37:05.760 --> 37:07.399
Garrett, get out in front of it.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.755
Yeah, I'm on it.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.313
What the hell?

38:13.120 --> 38:14.349
Congratulations.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.795
You just robbed
one of Max Klemp's private planes.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.191
He owns this airstrip and everything in it.

38:22.320 --> 38:25.518
I'm quite sure he'll be looking
for an introduction to you now.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.833
You've got some balls. Good for you.

39:34.440 --> 39:38.514
My pilot, on the other hand, was weak.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.794
I can't stand the weak.

39:46.680 --> 39:49.149
So you two took Kuhn for a bit of a ride?

39:49.960 --> 39:50.916
Something like that.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.390
Do you know how much a new propeller costs?

39:53.480 --> 39:56.439
We're worth it, though, if I may, Mr. Klemp.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.080
My brother and I have pulled jobs
on all five continents.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.234
Your car collection is legendary.
We can help you add to it.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.711
Any car, any time. We're not rookies.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.312
I think our work speaks for itself.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.390
You can easily hire the gutter punks down
in Marseille to steal what needs stealing,

40:13.480 --> 40:15.756
but if you want it done right...

40:16.840 --> 40:17.830
Well,

40:18.600 --> 40:20.478
we have a reputation.

40:23.440 --> 40:24.430
You.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.510
Me?

40:25.800 --> 40:28.360
No, the one without the mouth,
the big guy. Come here.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.400
Come on, big guy.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.840
Hold this nail for me.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.831
You know, my brother
really handles the negotiation.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.080
There's nothing to negotiate.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.192
You see, I don't care about reputation
or how good you think you are.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.549
I care about one thing.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.350
Trust.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.671
There are not many people
in this town you can trust.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.960
What makes you think you're one of them?

41:06.520 --> 41:07.556
We're not from this town.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.830
Neither am I.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.678
You can buy trust, Mr. Klemp.

41:23.200 --> 41:27.516
Respect, on the other hand,
you can't put a price on that.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.510
I'll be in touch.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.430
Thank you.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.270
You know what?

41:48.720 --> 41:49.710
Something wrong?

41:50.720 --> 41:51.710
I'm a car enthusiast.

41:53.560 --> 41:54.550
You wanna see my garage.

41:58.920 --> 42:01.640
Don't you think I know
that you're Jacomo Morier's cousin?

42:02.600 --> 42:04.512
- Second cousin.
- Second cousin.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.590
I think.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.190
I never get those things right.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.351
First cousin once removed, second cousin...

42:10.840 --> 42:11.876
Why are you here?

42:11.960 --> 42:13.599
- Look, Mr. Klemp...
- Let him answer.

42:16.440 --> 42:20.753
Two years ago,
I went to my cousin to ask for work.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.270
In front of all his men, he spun me
around, kicked me in the ass.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.959
Told me to go beg for scraps
in someone else's junkyard.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.749
Said our blood meant nothing to him.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.079
Let me tell you something, Mr. Klemp.

42:38.960 --> 42:42.960
When an opportunity comes along
where he's standing on a cliff's edge,

42:46.800 --> 42:47.836
I'll be the one to push.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.790
Is that so?

43:31.200 --> 43:32.190
Beautiful.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.880
GTO 250.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.437
I haven't seen one of these
outside a car magazine.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.394
She's gorgeous.

43:41.840 --> 43:42.830
It's not a car.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.270
It's a masterpiece.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.069
Trumps them all, right?

43:49.360 --> 43:51.033
All right, enough. Get out of here.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.710
Here, keep this safe.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.756
He's a liability.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.230
What did you say?

44:13.240 --> 44:16.832
I said you're a goddamn liability, and the
last thing I need is an amateur in my crew.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.320
Amateur?

44:18.400 --> 44:20.392
You wouldn't even have looked
in the garage if it weren't for me.

44:20.960 --> 44:22.872
I clocked that garage
in the first five seconds.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.758
What I didn't do is draw attention to it.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.320
I found out what needed finding out.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.759
- You got the code, didn't you?
- No, you overplayed your hand.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.160
Having you around was a mistake.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.394
You think my cousin is going
to let you go on without me?

44:36.280 --> 44:37.475
I wouldn't bet on it.

44:38.440 --> 44:42.229
You know, what you said earlier
about throwing Morier off a cliff,

44:43.320 --> 44:44.310
was that true?

44:45.360 --> 44:46.476
I love my cousin.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.150
All right.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.880
Really? What now?

45:02.280 --> 45:04.112
They forced their way in
and said they would wait for you.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.879
Officer DePaul with INTERPOL,
and this is Officer Closson.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.279
You are Garrett and Andrew Foster?

45:10.400 --> 45:11.675
Yeah, that's right.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.400
And who's this?

45:14.160 --> 45:16.117
- Simon Dardin.
- Sorry. What?

45:16.400 --> 45:17.470
Simon Dardin.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.634
What is this about?

45:20.720 --> 45:22.074
Well, you tell me.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.880
Why would we be here
standing in your apartment?

45:24.960 --> 45:26.394
Well, I don't know.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.554
Seems illegal, though.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.715
Do you have to have a warrant in France?

45:32.520 --> 45:34.000
I think you have to have a warrant.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.030
Funny guy.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.757
We are investigating
a stolen car ring all over Europe,

45:39.880 --> 45:42.440
and the names that we hear again and again

45:42.520 --> 45:45.354
are two brothers named Foster.

45:45.440 --> 45:49.719
Yeah. Are you sure that it's "Foster"
coming up and not "Fosterre"?

45:51.040 --> 45:53.111
I see. You are smart guys.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.752
I love smart guys.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.320
I love to watch them crack.

46:02.320 --> 46:07.076
I love that moment in their eyes
when they realize they're not so smart.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.999
You must see that every morning
when you're brushing your teeth.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.194
See you soon, Foster brothers.

46:19.760 --> 46:21.513
We'll be there when you're not so smart.

46:32.080 --> 46:34.117
Seems like I need to be more worried
about the two of you

46:34.200 --> 46:36.112
than you need to worry about me.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.792
We need to get the hell out of here.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.793
Yeah, good luck with that.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.792
Listen, you say one word of this
to your cousin,

46:43.880 --> 46:46.918
and I'll be the person
throwing somebody off a cliff.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.400
Yeah?

46:59.720 --> 47:02.360
Tell me your "drop this"
radar isn't going off.

47:02.840 --> 47:03.830
I'm ignoring it.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.390
You shouldn't.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.437
Well, that's why I have you.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.953
We're just relying on way too many people
we don't know for this not to go sideways.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.310
We're a team. Remember?

47:17.280 --> 47:20.830
The sooner you start to realize that,
the sooner we can just get on with it.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.039
You really think I wanna steal cars
for the rest of my life?

47:30.120 --> 47:32.430
There are other ways to make Dad proud.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.157
Stubborn old dog, wasn't he?

47:40.560 --> 47:42.756
Never thought I'd forgive him when he left.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.114
Then seeing him in that hospital bed,

47:46.320 --> 47:48.789
chasing dreams till the very end.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.115
He wasn't the best dad.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.440
He brought us together, though, didn't he?

47:59.280 --> 48:02.876
It's just Stephanie.
She... She changes things.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.555
No, Andrew. She doesn't.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.832
The reason why you love her is because
she's more like us than you care to admit.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.832
Surely, you see that.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.600
So what are you saying?

48:15.680 --> 48:18.354
We continue to work together as a threesome?

48:19.040 --> 48:20.394
Well,

48:20.480 --> 48:23.951
I mean, I wouldn't have used that word,
but now that you mentioned it...

48:25.440 --> 48:26.635
Is there a moment you can't ruin?

48:53.840 --> 48:56.275
Don't you know this market
isn't safe for foreigners?

48:56.760 --> 48:58.080
Come with me.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.879
- Get your hands off me.
- Move it.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.510
Get out of my way!

49:46.920 --> 49:48.070
Don't we know them?

49:50.920 --> 49:52.149
Panahi's men.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.080
Run!

50:10.840 --> 50:11.830
Go left!

52:15.680 --> 52:17.717
- They took her.
- What?

52:18.080 --> 52:20.390
Morier's men, they snatched
Stephanie at the market.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.670
Morier!

52:32.640 --> 52:33.915
Hold it right there!

52:37.680 --> 52:39.558
Watch your manners, boy.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.239
Where is she?

52:44.400 --> 52:45.390
Try it.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.638
You wanna see her?

52:51.240 --> 52:52.276
Come on.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.390
- Steph!
- Andrew, stop!

52:57.480 --> 52:58.960
- No!
- Wait.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.952
Calm down. Think about it.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.793
Stop. Stop!

53:02.880 --> 53:05.679
I understand you boys are thinking
of running away from France

53:05.760 --> 53:06.876
- without stealing the one car I want.
- No!

53:06.960 --> 53:08.553
- Wait!
- You're trying to make a fool of me.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.676
She's not in this!

53:09.760 --> 53:11.592
Everyone is in this.

53:15.480 --> 53:16.470
No!

53:19.440 --> 53:20.590
Please.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.430
If you don't bring me that vintage Ferrari,

53:23.520 --> 53:26.319
this pretty girl's face
will be nothing but a skid mark.

53:26.400 --> 53:29.837
Then I'm gonna kill everyone you know.
Everyone you ever said <i>bonjour</i> to.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.872
I'm gonna kill every last one of them

53:31.960 --> 53:34.520
in ways that would make
the devil hide his eyes.

53:35.920 --> 53:38.799
- Am I making myself completely clear?
- Yes.

53:38.880 --> 53:42.590
Well then, let's consider our deal
officially renegotiated.

53:42.840 --> 53:46.836
I wanna hear your plan, and I wanna
meet your crew, every last one of them.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.110
Can I have a word with my brother
for a second?

53:51.320 --> 53:52.640
Come on. Andrew!

53:55.320 --> 53:56.800
Think.

53:58.080 --> 54:01.232
- This changes everything.
- No, it doesn't, Andrew.

54:01.320 --> 54:02.993
We can adapt.

54:05.040 --> 54:07.635
- I can't lose her.
- Neither can I.

54:12.680 --> 54:13.830
Yeah?

54:20.560 --> 54:23.837
Okay. You wanna know the plan?

54:25.320 --> 54:26.993
Meet us and our team
tomorrow morning at the <i>chapelle.</i>

54:41.360 --> 54:43.397
So, let's hear how you're gonna do this.

54:44.040 --> 54:47.920
The best way to steal from a thief
is to lure him away from the stash.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.354
How are we gonna do that?

54:50.000 --> 54:51.070
Well...

54:53.040 --> 54:55.839
<i>First, we're gonna get our hands
on a bulldozer.</i>

55:04.600 --> 55:06.273
<i>Then we're gonna steal some stuff.</i>

55:07.000 --> 55:11.040
<i>Police cars, police vans,</i>

55:12.280 --> 55:13.999
<i>and some riot gear.</i>

55:24.520 --> 55:25.920
So you're gonna boost police cars.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.358
Klemp has a lot of policemen in his pocket.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.989
We know, and we're counting on that.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.672
- Yes?
- <i>Max Klemp?</i>

55:37.760 --> 55:39.831
This is Corinne
from the police station in Marseille.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.719
I was told to tip you that
you are being raided sometime today.

55:56.360 --> 55:57.919
- Come on. Let's go.
- Alpha team left.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.430
Bravo, right. Go, go, go!

56:00.520 --> 56:02.079
<i>If you back a rat into a corner,</i>

56:02.160 --> 56:04.436
<i>he'll bare his teeth and fight to the death.</i>

56:04.520 --> 56:08.958
<i>But if you give that rat
an option, he'll take it.</i>

56:09.720 --> 56:12.280
<i>And then you can steer him
in whichever direction you want.</i>

56:12.560 --> 56:15.155
<i>And how are you sure he'll run?</i>

56:15.600 --> 56:18.035
<i>Because all rats desert a sinking ship.</i>

56:18.120 --> 56:19.156
<i>It's instinct.</i>

56:19.240 --> 56:21.709
<i>Just remember, you're dealing
with a very smart rat.</i>

56:21.800 --> 56:23.200
We're smarter.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.356
What the hell is this?

56:31.840 --> 56:33.274
Just be cool.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.518
Weapons down! Now!

57:28.360 --> 57:30.317
How stupid do you think I am?

57:32.040 --> 57:34.077
The minute your cousin
stepped foot on my property,

57:34.160 --> 57:35.355
I knew you were up to something.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.790
You learned nothing from our history.

57:41.160 --> 57:43.880
You have something of value, I take it.

57:44.200 --> 57:48.558
The drugs, the mule routes,
the ports, and now Marseille.

57:49.800 --> 57:52.918
This is my town. I'll never let you take it.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.679
I tell you one thing.

57:56.760 --> 57:59.036
I'm always 10 steps ahead of him,

57:59.160 --> 58:01.311
so whatever you're gonna do,

58:02.200 --> 58:03.680
I'd think twice.

58:08.280 --> 58:10.749
Good to see you, old friend.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.275
Take him tomorrow, and I am coming with you.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.999
That's not a good idea
if we're gonna do this.

58:42.120 --> 58:43.520
"If'?

58:44.360 --> 58:45.999
I say tomorrow.

58:46.080 --> 58:47.639
And I'll drive that car.

58:48.360 --> 58:50.591
7:00 a.m. Here.

59:04.120 --> 59:06.396
Too bad we have to leave
your sexy girl behind.

59:06.520 --> 59:08.637
I'm sure my cousin
will take good care of her.

59:19.920 --> 59:22.560
I wanna talk to someone.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.270
Listen, you bastards, let me out!

59:52.920 --> 59:53.910
Thanks.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.674
So, the food is good?

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.556
I see you are still getting along so well.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.070
Although I should tell you, we have
discovered that you are not Simon Dardin.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.033
You are the cousin of <i>Monsieur</i>
Jacomo Morier from right here in Marseille.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.600
Good work, officers.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.673
You should be proud
of your investigative skills.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.829
You lied to us. We know something is up.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.038
And when we find out what it is,

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.115
we'll all be spending
much more time together.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.270
I guarantee that.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.313
You know, I'm going to enjoy this.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.390
What are you talking about?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.790
We can't have them follow us,
or none of this is gonna work.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.793
So, we're gonna have INTERPOL
think that we had a falling out.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.640
- Falling out?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.149
Son of a bitch!

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.390
Morier's cousin?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.998
Come on.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.313
If you insist. Thanks.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.675
Andrew! Wait. Where are you going?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.595
All alone again?

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.355
Story of my life.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.869
Mind if I join you?

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.595
Look, I'm really not in the mood.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.590
Nice.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.394
It's not my flavor.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.436
Yeah, you're right.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.876
Ferrari has never made a car like the 166.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.510
What did you just say?

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.069
Well, my father spent 20 years restoring one.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.629
- The original red Barchetta?
- Yes.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.478
- That's my favorite car.
- Really?

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.120
Did you ever get to drive it?

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.839
Every Sunday afternoon.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.914
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.993
It's gonna be okay, Garrett.
We're gonna do this.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.595
Come here.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.394
What? What do you want?

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.830
I'm hungry.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.034
Come on. Please.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.639
I thought we could eat together.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.394
What do you think?

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.433
You think I'm stupid?

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.398
You think I'm gonna fall
for your little trick?

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.472
Well, you fell for Andrew's, didn't you?

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.720
I bet you didn't even fight back.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.600
What did you say?

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.839
What did you say?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.916
Come here.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.910
Nice try.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.992
Okay, this is it.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.230
You know what to do.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.556
Buckle up.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.120
Okay. Let's roll.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.873
- Hello?
- Max Klemp.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.400
<i>Monsieur</i> Morier?

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.116
INTERPOL.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.720
Out of the car, please.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.070
Get the car. We're leaving.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.952
Everyone back up.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.874
Forgive me for being direct, <i>Monsieur</i> Morier,

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.749
but are you not here expecting to meet
two men by the name of Foster?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.150
I don't know what you're speaking of.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.631
I'm speaking of the two men whom we
witnessed beating Mr. Laurent here.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.035
I'm speaking of the two men who
are going to incite a crime war for you.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.520
You are all under arrest.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.997
- You've got to be kidding me.
- It's okay. I have more, yeah?

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.832
We don't have time.
We've got to get inside now.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.153
<i>The best way to steal from a thief
is to lure him away from the stash.</i>

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:22.312
You work out of the Brussels office, yes?

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.515
That's right.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.714
Tell Officer Vanderberg

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.076
this is the second time
he sends his bees to sting me,

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.993
- and it won't work this time, either.
- I will tell him.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.434
There is no Officer Vanderberg.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.191
I told you I could be your inside girl.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.353
Never doubted you for a second.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.360
You're an idiot.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.112
Tick-tock, turtledoves.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.040
Fire in the hole.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.640
Come on.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.350
Yes!

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.797
I hope you're out of there
because you've got trouble.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.473
What kind of trouble?

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.631
Morier made us. He's heading home.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.560
Come on.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.390
Come on.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.313
You all in?

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.473
All right, guys, whatever you do,
don't wreck these cars.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.640
- Shit.
- What?

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.960
You looking for this?

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.919
Andrew, we don't have time.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.555
- Look at me.
- But...

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.994
Steph.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.280
Will you marry me?

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.199
You're crazy.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.389
Yes.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.278
Yes, go. Go! Go now.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.874
All right, proceed as planned.
We'll take the canyon.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.153
<i>Leon, get ready to blow
that bridge behind us.</i>

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.480
Andrew, it's not worth it.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.479
Andrew, no!

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.549
The Riviera Run.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.830
Damn.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.157
Devin, hope you're ready for Plan B.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.950
<i>I'm ready.</i>

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.999
Andrew, what are you doing?

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.154
Morier, this ends now.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.635
What part of the plan is this?

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.034
Thought you didn't need a plan.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.153
I will call you.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.596
I promise.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.870
Yeah.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.631
- Guys.
- Yeah, it's cool.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.277
Officers. Glad to see you.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.391
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.800
Good.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.954
- Next time, we want to drive.
- You've got it.

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:29.630
Thanks for playing along.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.355
Anytime.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.999
By the way, the guy in the barrel,
was it too much?

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.994
No, it was a nice touch.

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.470
Good.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.877
I have to hand it to you, it was a bold plan.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.160
Yeah? Well, you know what they say.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.952
Fortune favors the bold.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.472
Why does this keep happening to me?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.037
I'm a good person. I mean, I talk a lot,

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.958
but I don't deserve
to be blown off every time.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.160
- That phone's not gonna ring.
- You don't know that.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.078
Yes, I do.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.434
What is that I hear?

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.717
- Any trouble?
- Nope.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.994
You are beautiful. You know that?

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.519
That's my favorite thing about her.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.590
The ability to shut him up.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.920
What?

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.759
Oh, my God!

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.277
Did I ever tell you about the time
I changed the oil on that '62 Ferrari?

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.558
Greatest goddamn day
a grease jockey like me ever had.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.600
It's all yours, old man.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.800
So that's it, then?

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.714
We're done?

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.911
- You know...
- What?

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.474
There is one more thing.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.951
A '53 Sierra Coupe.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.272
There are only nine in the world.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.760
And one is in Barcelona.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.150
You up for it?

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.154
I'm driving.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.913
You think I bought
that you just came up with that plan?

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.432
A wise man once told me,

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.870
"If you look around
and can't see who the mark is,

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.800
"then it's you."
