<i>He's gonna win
another 50, 60k.</i>

01:42.437 --> 01:44.370
<i>All right, let's not
go backwards, huh?</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:47.604
These people you run into wanna
be boss, huh? They should know.

01:47.671 --> 01:50.437
I told you. You don't listen, you nut.

01:51.471 --> 01:54.304
You want a coffee?

01:54.370 --> 01:56.404
I don't know--

02:01.370 --> 02:03.604
<i>FBI, get down!</i>

02:03.671 --> 02:05.771
<i>FBI, down!</i>

02:44.504 --> 02:46.804
What is that?

02:46.878 --> 02:49.200
<i>What?</i>

02:51.801 --> 02:53.778
Is this it?

03:13.274 --> 03:15.401
- What's going on?
- Go back to sleep.

03:16.979 --> 03:20.100
Anthony Soprano, detective
gaudioso, essex county.

03:20.179 --> 03:22.532
- I have a warrant for your arrest.
- For what?

03:22.606 --> 03:24.931
- Are you Anthony Soprano?
- What, did you bring the whole county with you?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.433
We don't take any chances when
it concerns an illegal firearm

03:27.508 --> 03:29.200
Containing hollow-Point
ammunition.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.633
What?

03:31.706 --> 03:34.302
Where's the FBI?

03:36.277 --> 03:38.632
Can I see a warrant?
We have the right.

03:41.775 --> 03:43.732
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

03:43.806 --> 03:45.732
Will you tell them he's
got a medical condition?

03:45.808 --> 03:48.303
This is his family doctor
right here. Ask him.

03:54.175 --> 03:57.673
Hello, Janice.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.301
Did you talk to Tony about ming
up to the lake for his birthday?

04:00.376 --> 04:02.002
Tony was arrested
this morning.

04:02.078 --> 04:04.071
- For what?
- Weapons charge.

04:04.135 --> 04:06.630
They're booking him in north caldwell
before they take him to newark.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.901
<i>- I'm dropping off his clothes right now.
- It's a gun, no big deal.</i>

04:09.976 --> 04:11.631
Hollow-Point ammunition,
they said.

04:11.706 --> 04:13.301
Yeah, well,
he'll still make bail.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.301
You know he's not wild
about the drive, Janice.

04:15.377 --> 04:17.332
I really think it's
not the time right now.

04:17.404 --> 04:19.533
Well, let him know
we're with him.

04:19.606 --> 04:21.533
All right.

04:23.376 --> 04:26.372
If you have hollow-Point bullets
in anything, take 'em out today.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.630
Oh, God damn it, AJ,
there is tomato sauce

04:32.706 --> 04:34.173
All over these pants.

04:34.238 --> 04:37.301
AJ, I asked
for the brown suit

04:37.376 --> 04:39.172
From the
dry-Cleaning bag.

04:39.236 --> 04:40.900
The light didn't go on
in your closet.

04:40.977 --> 04:42.071
Stop it,ill you please?

04:44.278 --> 04:46.003
That show of force,

04:46.076 --> 04:49.903
Was that all about
humiliating dad?

05:22.206 --> 05:25.973
Your honor, the police
pulled over some kid

05:26.036 --> 05:28.971
And found a baggie
with cocaine residue.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.332
They also found
a gun loaded

05:31.407 --> 05:33.732
With hollow-Point bullets
on the floor.

05:33.805 --> 05:35.933
<i>Now in order
to beat the rap,</i>

05:36.006 --> 05:38.402
<i>This 16-Year-Old punk</i>

05:38.475 --> 05:40.201
<i>Claims he saw my client</i>

05:40.276 --> 05:43.400
Drop that weapon. And
mind you, not yesterday,

05:43.478 --> 05:45.572
But over two years ago,

05:45.635 --> 05:48.700
Using it in the meantime
to shoot at cans

05:48.778 --> 05:51.873
<i>And impress his friends.</i>

05:58.677 --> 06:01.270
I gotta tell you, Phil,
you look fantastic.

06:01.335 --> 06:03.573
- As in science fiction?
- No. What? Come on.

06:03.637 --> 06:07.231
Fucking empty compliments. I had
major fucking coronary disease.

06:07.306 --> 06:10.500
- He's not shitting you, Phil.
- I broke my fucking gazz in Florida

06:10.575 --> 06:13.831
On that goddamn recumbent
bike, I'll tell you that.

06:13.905 --> 06:16.503
Would I shit you?
You're my favorite turd.

06:18.707 --> 06:22.131
Fucking kid.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.931
Why don't you get
a real bike,

06:25.005 --> 06:27.101
Have some beach pussy
to look at

06:27.178 --> 06:29.403
While you're
working the heart?

06:29.477 --> 06:33.230
Go over the handlebars, have some
fucking head trauma? That's all I need.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.833
I'm 66 years old.

06:36.206 --> 06:38.771
Anyway, Phil,
welcome home.

06:38.836 --> 06:41.172
Thanks.

06:41.236 --> 06:43.732
Don't listen to me.

06:43.805 --> 06:45.473
I'm a cranky fuck lately.

06:45.538 --> 06:49.001
- Lately?
- Ooh!

06:49.077 --> 06:51.001
Why don't you get
a bike, you fat fuck?

06:58.307 --> 07:01.231
Ho...

07:05.378 --> 07:07.672
- how are you, doc?
- Let me get a drink. I'll be right back.

07:07.737 --> 07:09.333
All right.

07:09.408 --> 07:12.801
Glad you're back, Phil.
This fucking guy.

07:12.835 --> 07:14.932
How you doing?

07:15.005 --> 07:17.471
I'm here to enjoy
my grandchildren,

07:17.535 --> 07:19.730
My home.

07:24.905 --> 07:27.301
Did you hear the news?
Pork chop out in Jersey

07:27.376 --> 07:29.470
Got pinched on
a weapon charge.

07:29.538 --> 07:32.600
Drops a gat in a field somewhere
three fucking years ago.

07:32.676 --> 07:36.532
- What the fuck?
- Jersey. Fucking farmers, I don't know.

07:36.606 --> 07:39.301
Yeah, he was probably going
down on some sheep or some shit.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.832
Gun violence is a blight
on essex county,

07:47.905 --> 07:50.330
And Mr. Soprano
will be prosecuted

07:50.405 --> 07:52.532
To the fullest extent
of the law...

07:52.605 --> 07:55.200
you know what
that says, htor?

07:55.276 --> 07:58.032
That's your mommy's
name-- Blanca.

07:58.106 --> 08:00.372
<i>Blanca blanca blanca.</i>

08:00.436 --> 08:01.902
<i>That's mommy's name.</i>

08:01.976 --> 08:04.532
<i>AJ, can you
turn that off, please?</i>

08:08.136 --> 08:09.872
Tony.

08:09.936 --> 08:13.070
Take the yellow ribbons down,
everybody. Our boy's come home.

08:13.137 --> 08:16.271
- Dad.
- Hey. I'm fine.

08:21.175 --> 08:23.571
They let him
out already?

08:23.636 --> 08:27.100
What she means is, in our neighborhood
people don't get out right away.

08:30.537 --> 08:32.501
- Hello.
- Where's Christopher?

08:32.575 --> 08:34.673
I don't know.
I thought he was here.

08:34.736 --> 08:36.572
Hold on.
It's Bobby.

08:36.635 --> 08:39.102
<i>- Yeah.
- You want me to come down?</i>

08:39.177 --> 08:41.431
No, nothing a hot shower
won't fix.

08:41.506 --> 08:44.001
Carm told jan you were on
the fence about the weekend.

08:44.077 --> 08:47.932
I don't know.
Sit around, chew the fat.

08:48.006 --> 08:50.571
We got the meeting
with the canadians.

08:50.635 --> 08:54.371
Ton', with these hassles, you
should make it up our way here.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.973
You know, maybe that's
not such a bad idea.

09:03.638 --> 09:06.201
Mr. Federal attorney.

09:08.208 --> 09:11.230
- What can I do for you?
- You had to have your cheap headline, huh?

09:11.308 --> 09:13.802
Can you really not be aware
we've been building a Rico case

09:13.878 --> 09:17.833
Against Tony Soprano
for five fucking years?

09:17.905 --> 09:20.032
Then you blow this
popcorn fart.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.103
Are you gonna relax?

09:29.176 --> 09:30.702
It's just all this
little stuff,

09:30.775 --> 09:33.373
Like my phone has
one little bar up here.

09:33.437 --> 09:35.431
I mean, what if the broker's
trying to contact me?

09:35.507 --> 09:37.933
Caravan for my house is on
Tuesday, and the gas is still off.

09:40.477 --> 09:41.832
Mine works.

09:43.578 --> 09:47.232
- Hello.
- Essex county dropped the charges.

09:47.405 --> 09:49.671
I told you it was
a piece-Of-Shit case.

09:49.738 --> 09:51.773
<i>Two years old,
no decent prints.</i>

09:51.837 --> 09:55.231
<i>Santa Claus could have
dropped that gun in the snow.</i>

09:55.307 --> 09:58.171
They dropped the charges.
Well, I'd say I owe you one,

09:58.235 --> 10:01.472
But I'm sure
it's more than one.

10:01.538 --> 10:04.501
Neil, thanks again.

10:04.576 --> 10:07.831
Thank God. I really didn't want
it hanging over your birthday.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.331
Can we forget already
that it's my birthday?

10:10.407 --> 10:14.103
You say that and then you get
upset if nobody makes a fuss.

10:16.837 --> 10:19.402
- Hi.
- There you are.

10:19.477 --> 10:21.200
I was starting
to get worried.

10:21.276 --> 10:24.670
Traffic was horrible.

10:24.736 --> 10:27.073
- I've had to pee since glen falls.
- Well, go.

10:28.305 --> 10:30.332
Hey, sis.

10:33.435 --> 10:35.533
"National lampoon's
vacation."

10:35.608 --> 10:37.632
How you doing?

10:37.708 --> 10:40.131
How are you?

10:45.777 --> 10:48.631
You know, I gotta
admit it-- Every time,

10:48.705 --> 10:50.970
Once you're up here,

10:51.037 --> 10:53.703
It's pretty great.

10:55.775 --> 10:57.933
Aren't you adorable too

10:58.007 --> 11:01.330
With your matching dress
just like mommy's?

11:01.407 --> 11:03.770
- Hi, Mercedes.
- Hello.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.538
It's your favorite uncle.

11:05.604 --> 11:07.731
There she is.
It's that little girl,

11:07.809 --> 11:09.730
But I forget her name.

11:09.809 --> 11:12.132
- Gladys?
- Nica.

11:12.208 --> 11:15.072
- No, murgatroyd.
- Nica.

11:15.138 --> 11:16.573
Uh-Oh.

11:16.636 --> 11:19.202
Daddy.

11:19.277 --> 11:22.703
- Oh, daddy's girl.
- Daddy's little girl.

11:22.778 --> 11:25.602
- Who's hungry?
- You know, a water would be perfect.

11:25.676 --> 11:28.430
- Pellegrino?
- Sure.

11:28.505 --> 11:30.100
He's gonna pass.
He's stuffed.

11:32.135 --> 11:34.703
- Shoprite sparkling?
- Sure.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.672
If frank sinatra were coming
here to celebrate his birthday,

11:37.736 --> 11:40.270
Would you leave the lawn
like that? Looks like shit.

11:40.336 --> 11:42.331
He has enough lawn
maintenance at the new house

11:42.408 --> 11:44.073
Since somebody let
the gardener go.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.473
Oh, the house
wasn't enough.

11:46.535 --> 11:48.200
I'm joking.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.071
You know how
grateful we are.

11:50.137 --> 11:52.332
Beer, Ton'?

11:52.405 --> 11:54.673
Absolutely.

11:58.776 --> 12:00.733
Madonn'.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.402
800 rounds per.

12:02.475 --> 12:03.803
He chromed out
the inner carrier.

12:03.878 --> 12:06.101
And what I like, it's got
the panther fluted barrel.

12:06.175 --> 12:07.601
Is this how
you bagged that deer?

12:07.678 --> 12:09.800
I wouldn't use a firearm
like this on a deer.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.402
It's unsportsmanlike.

12:11.476 --> 12:14.373
Oh, like the poor prick's
got a chance against a 30.06.

12:14.435 --> 12:16.401
Actually,
last two seasons,

12:16.477 --> 12:18.633
I've been using a bow
and arrow exclusively.

12:18.707 --> 12:20.370
Get the fuck out
of here.

12:20.436 --> 12:22.602
Seriously, it levels
the playing field.

12:22.677 --> 12:26.300
The ar-10, that's my
birthday present to you.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.833
Thanks, Bobby.

12:27.905 --> 12:30.570
Don't say shit
to Carmela.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.133
Me and Tony almost got
a summer place--

12:51.208 --> 12:53.571
Down the Shore,
remember, Tony?

12:53.637 --> 12:55.170
Any more
stuffed mushrooms?

12:55.236 --> 12:58.232
My pop bought this place
'cause it was close to canada.

12:58.305 --> 13:00.773
He had ties in montreal.
You know, Ton'.

13:01.976 --> 13:04.330
His father, my grandpop,
come into the country

13:04.408 --> 13:06.273
Originally through
montreal, illegally.

13:06.337 --> 13:08.533
No kidding? He wasn't Ellis
island, your grandfather?

13:08.607 --> 13:12.372
Nah, got mixed up in some
shenanigans on the other side,

13:12.436 --> 13:14.671
Anti-Government
or something.

13:14.738 --> 13:16.801
Had a police record.

13:18.137 --> 13:20.332
They oughta build
a wall now, though.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.532
- I'm telling you.
- Amen.

13:22.608 --> 13:24.133
Mommy!

13:25.936 --> 13:27.201
When are
the kids back?

13:27.278 --> 13:30.070
Sophia the 7th and robert
the end of the month.

13:30.138 --> 13:31.733
That's nice.

13:31.808 --> 13:33.873
I'm very lucky
to be back

13:33.937 --> 13:36.802
With my family
after all these years.

13:38.077 --> 13:39.703
Look at you and me,
Tony.

13:39.778 --> 13:42.833
Who would have thought we'd have
the kind of relationship we have now?

13:42.906 --> 13:45.131
The credit goes
to you.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.530
You really changed.

13:46.607 --> 13:48.701
So I had to change?

13:48.778 --> 13:50.533
It's a compliment.

13:50.605 --> 13:53.102
You were fine.

13:53.178 --> 13:54.771
You're different

13:54.835 --> 13:56.672
Since that stuff
last year--

13:56.737 --> 13:58.433
<i>The shooting.</i>

13:58.508 --> 14:01.800
- I'm sure Carm would agree.
- I would.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.473
Oh, look,
the fish are jumping.

14:09.836 --> 14:13.232
I'm different how?
How am I different?

14:21.877 --> 14:23.871
Story you heard.

14:23.937 --> 14:27.100
- The pool.
- Oh my God, please.

14:27.177 --> 14:30.703
- What?
- You don't wanna know.

14:32.278 --> 14:34.633
Pradeep,
our pharmacist,

14:34.705 --> 14:36.400
Was at a pool party.

14:36.478 --> 14:38.633
All the kids were playing
in the water.

14:38.707 --> 14:42.073
The adults were all around
and having drinks, barbecuing.

14:43.237 --> 14:46.101
Somehow even with
all these people around,

14:46.176 --> 14:49.700
This three-Year-Old child
managed to fall into the pool.

14:49.778 --> 14:52.533
Nobody even noticed till finally
they found him floating face down

14:52.605 --> 14:54.633
In the water.

14:54.705 --> 14:57.100
Brain dead.

14:57.178 --> 14:59.931
Poor kid's in one of those
padded wheelchairs now.

15:01.036 --> 15:03.171
Oh.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.833
I can't get that story
out of my mind.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.531
I don't know why.

15:32.538 --> 15:34.533
Happy birthday.

15:48.736 --> 15:50.272
It's supposed
to rain down there,

15:50.336 --> 15:53.130
So make sure that all the
cellar windows are closed.

15:53.207 --> 15:56.300
<i>- Okay.
- And make sure you check the one by dad's wine rack.</i>

15:56.377 --> 15:59.002
- Okay.
- Easy, big fella.

15:59.075 --> 16:01.100
- That jacuzzi's bitchin'.
- Who is that?

16:01.178 --> 16:04.001
That's fran the waitress.
We're really busy down here.

16:04.076 --> 16:07.330
- You're at work?
- Yes, I'm at the pizzeria.

16:07.408 --> 16:08.972
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

16:09.037 --> 16:11.033
Bye.

16:12.036 --> 16:15.102
The jacuzzi
and the tub's fantastic.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.971
There's everybody.

16:21.037 --> 16:23.502
Don't let us forget
to wash the sheets, okay?

16:23.575 --> 16:26.170
Yeah, ha ha!

16:26.236 --> 16:29.200
Anthony reboam Soprano.

16:29.277 --> 16:30.673
What's up?

16:32.106 --> 16:35.072
Tony seem to hit the hooch
a little at lunch today?

16:35.206 --> 16:36.871
I think he's feeling
his age.

16:36.935 --> 16:38.600
What do you think
it's like for me?

16:38.675 --> 16:40.532
When we were kids,

16:40.605 --> 16:42.703
He'd do whatever I said.

16:44.605 --> 16:47.470
He ate one of tippy's milk-Bones
because I told him it was a cookie.

16:54.677 --> 16:57.331
My therapist sandy,

16:57.407 --> 17:00.201
She said my ma
was a splitter.

17:00.278 --> 17:03.200
She'd pit us three
against each other--

17:03.277 --> 17:05.272
To toughen us up,
I guess.

17:06.978 --> 17:09.472
I couldn't help hearing
you with AJ.

17:09.538 --> 17:13.133
God, you gotta walk on eggshells
with these kids today, huh?

17:13.204 --> 17:16.329
We're almost through
that phase, thank God.

17:19.136 --> 17:21.131
You're good with them.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.530
Really? I wish
he'd go back to college.

17:25.707 --> 17:28.203
He sleeps most nights
at blanca's.

17:28.278 --> 17:31.102
Speaking of kids and ma,

17:31.178 --> 17:33.132
Sandy said something
interesting--

17:33.205 --> 17:35.230
That when we were babies,

17:35.307 --> 17:37.403
Everything was fine,

17:37.475 --> 17:39.833
But ma couldn't stand that
as her babies got older,

17:39.906 --> 17:41.670
They separated from her.

17:41.737 --> 17:44.871
When they started
to talk and express ideas,

17:44.935 --> 17:48.131
That's when
the trouble started.

17:48.206 --> 17:50.700
It wasn't that
she didn't love us.

17:58.707 --> 18:00.733
Mmm-Mmm!

18:02.306 --> 18:05.331
<i>You've been a solid
performer for some time now.</i>

18:05.408 --> 18:07.672
Plus, you're my
brother-In-Law.

18:11.707 --> 18:14.800
You get older,
you think about things.

18:14.875 --> 18:17.802
You're a young man.
We both are.

18:17.878 --> 18:20.673
- World's still in front of us.
- Boss.

18:20.737 --> 18:23.933
My estimate historically,

18:24.005 --> 18:27.271
80% of the time it ends up
in the can like Johnny Sack

18:27.338 --> 18:30.170
Or on the embalming table
at cozarelli's.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.830
Don't even say it.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.533
No risk, no reward.

18:49.075 --> 18:52.400
I mean, yeah, our line
of work, it's always out there.

18:53.938 --> 18:56.333
You probably don't even hear
it when it happens, right?

18:56.406 --> 18:58.473
Ask your friend
in there on the wall.

18:59.575 --> 19:02.432
Listen to us.
Morbid fucks.

19:04.305 --> 19:07.633
Come to think of it, you never popped
your cherry in that regard, right?

19:07.705 --> 19:10.173
No.

19:10.237 --> 19:12.733
Yet your old man was
the fucking Terminator.

19:12.806 --> 19:14.800
I come close.

19:14.878 --> 19:18.733
I done other shit,
but no.

19:18.805 --> 19:21.301
A salut'.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.533
It's a big fat pain
in the balls.

19:23.607 --> 19:25.732
Especially now
with DNA evidence.

19:27.308 --> 19:29.203
My pop never
wanted it for me.

19:29.275 --> 19:31.333
He said there were times
with all the worry

19:31.405 --> 19:33.373
That he wished he could have
stayed in the shop full-Time,

19:33.438 --> 19:34.903
Just cut hair.

19:34.977 --> 19:37.831
To be honest, I'd rather he
fucking shot me than cut my hair.

19:43.738 --> 19:47.902
There's somebody I've been
bringing along to insulate myself

19:47.975 --> 19:51.470
From the stuff that
could bring down a boss,

19:51.538 --> 19:55.130
And take care of Carmela
too, in case...

19:55.205 --> 19:56.472
God forbid.

19:58.605 --> 20:01.273
Now maybe

20:01.338 --> 20:04.031
Between me
and this person...

20:04.108 --> 20:05.933
there's diverging agendas.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.633
- Sorry to hear it.
- It happens.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.972
Thing is, the newark
facilities manager,

20:12.035 --> 20:14.370
He's gonna fix it so we do
all the window replacements

20:14.438 --> 20:17.433
In the projects.

20:17.508 --> 20:21.071
I was thinking maybe
you should work that.

20:21.138 --> 20:22.772
I'm honored just
to be considered.

20:22.836 --> 20:26.873
Then we'll see what happens
after that, long-Term.

20:38.836 --> 20:41.233
- Time for presents.
- And grappa.

20:41.306 --> 20:43.633
I told you people I didn't
want any presents, just...

20:43.707 --> 20:46.472
just a few kind words.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.833
That was my father's line
every year.

20:48.908 --> 20:50.800
I get the joke,
believe me.

20:55.637 --> 20:57.333
"Soprano home movies."

20:57.405 --> 20:59.970
I had all the super 8s from
when we were kids transferred.

21:00.036 --> 21:02.772
Oh, cool.

21:02.837 --> 21:04.470
It's really
very thoughtful.

21:04.536 --> 21:06.801
Thank you.

21:06.877 --> 21:09.132
- Uh-Oh.
- Oh, look at these.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.331
Oh, look at this.

21:11.405 --> 21:13.432
Tailor-Mades, wow!

21:18.205 --> 21:21.030
You're not just a funny,
smart, lovable,

21:21.108 --> 21:22.972
Good-Looking guy.

21:23.036 --> 21:25.972
<i>- You're mine."
- Aww.</i>

21:26.035 --> 21:28.931
- Thank you, baby.
- Happy birthday.

21:29.005 --> 21:31.232
Cent' ann', Anthony.

21:31.307 --> 21:33.000
Oh, wait wait.

21:36.905 --> 21:38.801
To have my health,

21:38.878 --> 21:41.371
To be in this
beautiful spot

21:41.436 --> 21:43.370
With people
that I love--

21:44.907 --> 21:47.871
- I couldn't ask for more.
- Salut'.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.701
Six.

22:23.107 --> 22:24.771
Community chest.

22:24.838 --> 22:27.670
"Pay hospital $100."
Fuck me.

22:27.736 --> 22:30.100
What are you doing?
It goes in the bank.

22:30.175 --> 22:32.503
- We play the free parking rule.
- What free parking rule?

22:32.575 --> 22:35.202
Money from community chest and
chance goes into the middle.

22:35.276 --> 22:37.402
Whoever lands on free
parking ge the money.

22:37.477 --> 22:40.000
You show me that
in the rules.

22:40.075 --> 22:42.933
Technically it isn't in the rules,
but a lot of people play it that way.

22:43.007 --> 22:45.032
It adds a whole new level
of excitement to the game.

22:45.108 --> 22:47.072
I don't agree with that.

22:47.138 --> 22:48.933
When we were growing up in our
house, this is how we played.

22:49.008 --> 22:51.903
You know, the parker brothers
took time to think this all out.

22:51.977 --> 22:53.931
I think we should
respect that.

22:54.008 --> 22:56.801
Fuck the parker brothers.
Just play the game.

22:58.178 --> 23:00.371
Out of grappa.
How about some rémy?

23:01.876 --> 23:05.333
- 9, 10, 11...
- Yay!

23:05.405 --> 23:08.071
- Fuck.
- Marvin gardens

23:08.138 --> 23:09.503
With two houses--

23:09.577 --> 23:12.572
360 simoleons.

23:14.036 --> 23:17.573
Don't throw the money
at me. Hand it to me.

23:17.636 --> 23:19.232
I saw that.

23:19.306 --> 23:22.230
- Saw what?
- You just kyped $500 from the bank.

23:22.307 --> 23:23.773
God damn it, Tony!

23:23.835 --> 23:26.670
I beg your pardon,
my sweet little potato.

23:26.735 --> 23:28.230
You asshole.

23:33.136 --> 23:36.201
- Free parking, baby.
- This is bullshit.

23:36.277 --> 23:39.172
You take a game of skill and
you make it just about luck.

23:39.236 --> 23:41.173
Are you listening
to this fucking crybaby?

23:41.236 --> 23:43.230
How about I make up
my own fucking rules?

23:43.307 --> 23:45.700
How about every time I land
on one of my properties,

23:45.778 --> 23:47.701
I get $100.
How about that?

23:47.777 --> 23:49.031
How about that?
How about that?

23:49.107 --> 23:50.902
Whose turn is it,
my turn?

23:50.975 --> 23:53.131
<i>It was mine.
Okay.</i>

23:53.205 --> 23:54.970
Here's $150.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.302
I want to put a house
on ventnor.

23:57.377 --> 24:00.032
Daddy!

24:00.108 --> 24:01.872
She wants to say
good night again.

24:01.935 --> 24:05.003
- Aww.
- You gotta go to bed, baby.

24:05.078 --> 24:08.332
Come here, my sweetie.

24:08.407 --> 24:11.503
Yes, so if you go
to bed,

24:11.578 --> 24:13.072
You know what?

24:13.135 --> 24:17.001
Mommy will give you
a willy wonka laffy taffy.

24:17.078 --> 24:20.632
<i>- Laffy taffy!
- Jan, we talked about this.</i>

24:20.706 --> 24:23.473
You tell me the difference
between bribery

24:23.537 --> 24:25.702
And positive reinforcement.

24:25.778 --> 24:27.673
That looked like
a bribe to me.

24:27.738 --> 24:30.573
You know what, uncle Tony?
Butt the fuck out.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.202
In front of the baby.

24:32.278 --> 24:35.800
They're in the kitchen.
Night-Night.

24:39.407 --> 24:42.733
I could tape you. Send
it to "parents magazine."

24:42.806 --> 24:43.732
What's that supposed
to mean?

24:43.808 --> 24:45.900
When we were kids,
remember?

24:45.975 --> 24:47.901
You tape-Recorded me
and barb fighting.

24:47.975 --> 24:50.201
You blackmailed us
for over a fucking month.

24:50.277 --> 24:53.003
- I did no such thing.
- Oh! Yeah, you did.

24:53.076 --> 24:56.370
- You fed him a milk-Bone.
- You what?

24:56.436 --> 24:59.300
You want to swap
family stories, Ton'?

24:59.375 --> 25:01.632
How about the time
that mom and dad

25:01.705 --> 25:03.601
Were coming back
from the copa?

25:03.706 --> 25:05.170
That's enough, Janice.

25:05.236 --> 25:06.830
And ma's hair...

25:06.907 --> 25:10.771
that never even happened. And anyway,
it's not for public consumption.

25:10.838 --> 25:13.933
- Oh, my God, what?
- They're driving back from Manhattan

25:14.007 --> 25:16.933
With uncle jun
and his goomar.

25:17.007 --> 25:18.931
Oh, what was
her name, Tony?

25:19.005 --> 25:22.030
- Your ass. - That's how we
heard the story-- Through her.

25:22.105 --> 25:25.073
Rose marie.
Anyway,

25:25.137 --> 25:26.733
My father's driving,

25:26.808 --> 25:30.072
And she's ragging on his ass.
You know how she'd get.

25:30.137 --> 25:33.630
He'd been drinking,
I guess.

25:33.708 --> 25:36.700
- And he takes out his gun.
- Oh my God.

25:36.776 --> 25:38.601
- Boom!
- Holy shit.

25:38.676 --> 25:40.071
Fucking blew it

25:40.138 --> 25:43.100
Right through
her beehive hairdo.

25:46.005 --> 25:48.672
I can't believe you
never told me that story.

25:48.736 --> 25:50.733
Yeah,
what's the big deal?

25:50.806 --> 25:53.570
'Cause it makes us look like
a fucking dysfunctional family.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.773
- Jesus Christ!
- My turn.

25:56.838 --> 25:59.172
And don't you ever tell the kids
that about their grandfather.

25:59.235 --> 26:00.972
Of course not.

26:01.036 --> 26:03.503
So did you guys look at her
hair? Was there powder burns?

26:03.575 --> 26:06.432
She had it bobbed
the next day.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.531
- Play the game.
- Okay okay.

26:10.606 --> 26:12.333
Doubles.

26:12.407 --> 26:15.132
Ah, one-Two-Three,
four-Five-Six...

26:15.208 --> 26:16.602
boardwalk--
I own it.

26:16.678 --> 26:18.170
You blew guys
under it.

26:19.676 --> 26:21.600
<i>I roll again.</i>

26:21.678 --> 26:22.902
Okay.

26:22.976 --> 26:25.873
"Second prize in
a beauty contest.

26:25.937 --> 26:28.002
Collect $10."

26:28.076 --> 26:29.671
Go ahead!

26:29.737 --> 26:31.270
Make your stupid joke.

26:31.336 --> 26:33.202
I got nothing to say.

26:33.278 --> 26:35.601
Think I'll buy
a railroad.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.433
A german shepherd's shaved
asshole won first prize.

26:38.508 --> 26:41.832
Ho-- You're talking
about my wife.

26:41.905 --> 26:44.233
- You married her.
- This is my home.

26:44.308 --> 26:45.773
No more talking
like that.

26:45.836 --> 26:48.270
- It's okay, Bobby.
- Stay outta this.

26:48.337 --> 26:50.471
You sopranos--

26:50.537 --> 26:52.173
You go too far.

26:57.205 --> 27:00.402
All right. You know,
jan, he's right.

27:00.476 --> 27:02.733
I'm sorry.

27:02.805 --> 27:04.800
I crossed the line.

27:04.878 --> 27:07.430
<i>- Apologize.
It won't happen again.</i>

27:07.507 --> 27:09.732
My turn--
Oh fuck, income tax.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.600
...with his schlong
in jan's mouth...

27:23.906 --> 27:25.703
- oh, Tony!
- Bobby!

27:31.937 --> 27:33.170
No, stop!

27:36.335 --> 27:37.872
What are you doing?

27:41.038 --> 27:42.472
Stop that now!

27:49.738 --> 27:50.933
You fuck!

27:51.005 --> 27:52.301
<i>Tony!</i>

27:54.578 --> 27:56.132
Tony!
Stop it!

27:58.635 --> 28:00.272
Ow!

28:06.035 --> 28:08.032
Bobby!

28:14.107 --> 28:16.802
What the fuck are you doing? Stop!

28:16.878 --> 28:18.902
Stop!

28:18.976 --> 28:20.500
<i>Bobby!</i>

28:20.575 --> 28:22.671
<i>Mommy!</i>

28:22.737 --> 28:25.531
<i>- Mommy!
- What do we pay you for? Put her to bed.</i>

28:28.278 --> 28:30.532
<i>Bobby!</i>

28:30.605 --> 28:33.403
Tony-- Tony,
are you all right?

28:33.475 --> 28:35.201
Oh, Jesus.

28:36.808 --> 28:39.473
Come on-- Oh.

28:39.536 --> 28:41.973
<i>Bobby-- Stop.</i>

28:42.037 --> 28:43.771
Stop, you are
in no condition.

28:43.835 --> 28:46.133
You'll kill
yourself!

28:48.878 --> 28:50.030
Fuck!

28:57.637 --> 29:00.202
I'm okay.

29:00.277 --> 29:01.970
Oh, my shoulder
is killing me.

29:02.038 --> 29:04.673
Jesus fucking Christ,
Tony.

29:04.735 --> 29:06.770
Is he all right?

29:06.836 --> 29:10.001
<i>Hold it, everybody.</i>

29:11.438 --> 29:14.071
Look, Ton',
I'm really sorry.

29:14.135 --> 29:15.431
Bobby,
just shut up.

29:15.508 --> 29:18.001
Let's all just
go to bed.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.633
I'll go get
some ice.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.900
What the fuck were
you thinking?

29:38.975 --> 29:41.131
You're my wife.
He insulted you.

29:41.208 --> 29:44.201
I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

29:44.276 --> 29:46.872
Oh, God, he is
head of the family.

29:46.936 --> 29:50.202
Do you think he's just gonna wake
up tomorrow and forget about this?

31:13.437 --> 31:15.002
What the fuck
are you doing?

31:16.578 --> 31:19.800
You beat me
fair and square.

31:19.877 --> 31:22.373
Come on,
let's just...

31:54.175 --> 31:57.570
well, I hope
you're proud of yourself.

32:05.635 --> 32:07.770
How's your shoulder?

32:07.838 --> 32:09.972
- Great.
- Maybe we should have it looked at.

32:10.038 --> 32:11.931
I'm packed.
I would like to go.

32:14.676 --> 32:18.932
You were right. You told me
to ease up on the drinking.

32:20.507 --> 32:22.033
You shoulda' insisted.

32:22.105 --> 32:23.673
So now it's my fault?

32:25.208 --> 32:28.330
Go wash your face
so we can leave.

32:37.637 --> 32:41.071
I hope you're hungry.
I made a frittata.

32:42.708 --> 32:44.432
And ramos fizzes.

32:44.506 --> 32:47.471
Well, thank you but we think
it'd be better if we left.

32:47.536 --> 32:48.732
Not because of
last night?

32:48.808 --> 32:50.402
It's for the best.

32:50.478 --> 32:52.502
Come on,
we're family!

32:52.577 --> 32:54.432
Jesus, these
things happen.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.470
I really think we'd all
be more comfortable.

32:56.537 --> 32:58.703
We had a little
too much to drink,

32:58.775 --> 33:02.471
But no harm done. The whole
thing's already forgotten.

33:02.536 --> 33:06.102
Besides, Tony, we have that
thing later. The canucks.

33:06.175 --> 33:08.572
It's a sin
to waste food.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.033
Well, I don't know.

33:11.106 --> 33:13.773
Here--
Hair of the dog.

34:01.735 --> 34:05.030
<i>...suicide car bomber
kills two us soldiers...</i>

34:05.105 --> 34:07.200
<i>...west of baghdad.</i>

34:07.278 --> 34:10.371
<i>That makes five americans killed
in iraq over the past two days.</i>

34:10.435 --> 34:12.172
<i>There are more
aqi deaths,</i>

34:12.235 --> 34:15.030
<i>At least 29 bodies found
scattered around baghdad today...</i>

34:15.105 --> 34:17.203
fucking look at him
out there.

34:17.275 --> 34:19.201
What?

34:19.275 --> 34:22.203
I've seen that
sitting in the chair thing.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.830
Come on.
Peop sit in chairs.

34:32.978 --> 34:34.500
<i>The couple from
verona never came back</i>

34:34.574 --> 34:36.601
To take a second look
at the house.

34:40.108 --> 34:42.670
Meadow's staying in
this weekend to study.

34:44.935 --> 34:47.601
Pediatricians aren't
the highest-Paid doctors--

34:47.676 --> 34:49.172
That's radiologists.

34:49.235 --> 34:53.803
But still, what
a wonderful thing to be.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.932
That fucking throw rug
hadn't been there,

34:58.005 --> 35:00.502
Would've been Bobby
on his back, not me.

35:00.575 --> 35:03.670
- What?
- I wouldn't have slipped. I would have kicked his ass.

35:03.736 --> 35:06.833
Jesus Christ,
do you think I care?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.372
Oh, you don't, huh?

35:09.437 --> 35:10.903
You were there--

35:10.978 --> 35:13.830
That night in the crowd in
the parking lot at pizza world,

35:13.905 --> 35:16.003
When I took
dominic tedesco.

35:16.077 --> 35:18.270
I didn't even know your
name, but I remember

35:18.338 --> 35:21.131
Our eyes met, and you
were blown away.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.473
I was in fucking
high school.

35:25.478 --> 35:28.630
I'm supposed to be turned on by
you beating up your brother-In-Law

35:28.708 --> 35:30.430
At your 47th birthday?

35:30.505 --> 35:32.203
How old is Bobby?
42, 43?

35:32.275 --> 35:34.500
You think those four years
don't make a difference?

35:34.576 --> 35:36.571
You had it coming.

35:36.638 --> 35:38.830
You get away with murder
because you're his boss.

35:38.907 --> 35:40.472
Oh, really?

35:40.535 --> 35:43.130
And how about the fact he wouldn't
be living in that fucking mansion

35:43.207 --> 35:45.072
If it wasn't for me?

35:45.138 --> 35:48.200
I had to sacrifice my entire
friendship with Johnny Sack

35:48.276 --> 35:50.130
To get him and Janice
that house.

35:51.336 --> 35:53.101
Funny how everybody
forgets that, huh?

35:53.175 --> 35:55.130
They are grateful,
Tony.

35:55.205 --> 35:57.301
Jesus--!

35:57.376 --> 35:59.970
You know, you and your sister,
you are emotionally blocked.

36:00.037 --> 36:03.102
I'm old, Carm.

36:03.178 --> 36:05.471
And my body has
suffered a trauma

36:05.537 --> 36:08.231
That it will probably
never fully recover from,

36:08.308 --> 36:11.071
So why don't we just
face the facts?

36:18.178 --> 36:20.071
- Yeah?
- Hey, t, it's me.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.230
Just wanted to wish you
a belated happy birthday.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.000
We had a scare
last summer.

36:50.076 --> 36:52.633
Guy down the road was fishing,
thought he caught a snakehead.

36:52.706 --> 36:53.703
Yuck.

36:53.778 --> 36:55.731
Thankfully, it was
only a bowfin.

36:55.805 --> 36:57.872
<i>- What's a snakehead?
- It's this horrible, ugly fish...</i>

36:57.936 --> 36:59.571
tell you something,
Bobby.

36:59.637 --> 37:01.301
We had this little tussle
a year ago,

37:01.376 --> 37:02.803
Before my injury--

37:02.878 --> 37:04.131
This again?

37:05.738 --> 37:07.900
Ton', I think
everyone here knows

37:07.976 --> 37:09.333
You were at
a disadvantage.

37:09.406 --> 37:11.133
I don't want to take
nothin' away from you,

37:11.207 --> 37:13.230
But...

37:13.307 --> 37:15.231
sucker punch is
a sucker punch.

37:15.308 --> 37:16.733
So then it wasn't
fair and square?

37:16.808 --> 37:18.032
I mean, make up
your mind.

37:18.106 --> 37:19.872
I think we both know
what's what.

37:21.307 --> 37:24.033
But forget about it.
I have.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.373
Come on, Bobby,
let's go.

37:30.437 --> 37:32.070
Where are
you two going?

37:32.138 --> 37:34.003
Play some golf
with some people.

37:34.076 --> 37:35.430
Oh, right.

37:35.505 --> 37:37.231
Why don't you just hit
a few into the lake?

37:37.306 --> 37:39.171
Bobby, come on.

37:47.707 --> 37:50.103
You okay?

37:50.176 --> 37:52.430
Could turn the air on.

37:52.508 --> 37:54.333
I'm good.

37:54.405 --> 37:57.633
Just I should have taken
a leak before we left.

38:10.838 --> 38:13.602
Oh, honey,
look at you go!

38:13.675 --> 38:16.731
Mercedes, you didn't tell me that
you were taking her in the lake.

38:16.806 --> 38:18.003
I'm watching her,
miss Janice.

38:18.077 --> 38:19.432
You're supposed
to tell me

38:19.508 --> 38:20.973
Whenever you take her
in the lake.

38:21.035 --> 38:22.130
It's all right.
I'm here, too.

38:22.206 --> 38:23.700
I don't want nica
going in the lake

38:23.777 --> 38:25.401
Without my knowing.

38:26.808 --> 38:28.700
Come on, you've been
in there long enough.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.002
Nica, did you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

38:33.076 --> 38:34.102
No!

38:34.176 --> 38:36.672
What did you say?

38:36.735 --> 38:38.231
Nica, come over here.

38:38.306 --> 38:40.203
- No.
- Don't tell me no.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.873
Don't you ever
tell me no!

38:44.538 --> 38:46.633
- Mad.
- You're not mad.

38:46.705 --> 38:48.771
You have no right
to feel mad.

38:48.836 --> 38:51.200
- I'll give you
something to be mad about.

38:51.277 --> 38:52.871
Take her to the house,

38:52.935 --> 38:54.833
And put her to bed now.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.132
She's never spoken to me
like that before-- Never.

39:02.205 --> 39:04.972
- Probably needs that nap.
- That fucking Bobby jr,

39:05.036 --> 39:07.102
He's going through his
goddamn adolescence.

39:07.175 --> 39:08.673
He's nothing but
lip and attitude.

39:09.876 --> 39:11.273
She's imitating.

39:11.337 --> 39:12.903
She's got
that pitch-Perfect ear.

39:15.505 --> 39:17.533
I'm a little hyper today.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.600
<i>Maybe it's these
estrogen pills.</i>

39:19.676 --> 39:21.431
Well, if you're
as hungover as I am...

39:31.476 --> 39:34.200
that was some ory
you told, though.

39:35.608 --> 39:37.873
My dad and the gun?

39:37.936 --> 39:41.103
That alone was worth
the price of admission.

39:41.177 --> 39:45.172
<i>Oh, he was nabolidan'
to his core, boy.</i>

39:51.908 --> 39:53.602
Mmm.

39:57.807 --> 40:00.231
I had this boyfriend once--

40:00.307 --> 40:03.273
One night he hit me.

40:03.336 --> 40:05.401
Boy oh boy,
I blew my lid.

40:05.476 --> 40:07.870
I completely exploded.

40:09.337 --> 40:11.533
I'm more like my dad.

40:11.605 --> 40:12.770
Than who?

40:12.838 --> 40:15.830
Tony, for example.

40:15.905 --> 40:18.731
So, what are you saying?
He's more like your mother?

40:18.806 --> 40:19.832
<i>No.</i>

40:19.906 --> 40:22.830
Listen, he's got that
temper too.

40:28.736 --> 40:31.100
In the end he went
his separate way.

40:31.177 --> 40:32.702
Who?

40:32.776 --> 40:34.930
My boyfriend.

40:36.005 --> 40:38.073
I'm not proud
of it, though.

40:38.138 --> 40:40.430
Sounds like he deserved it.

40:46.476 --> 40:48.000
My mother, though,

40:48.075 --> 40:50.603
She could lay out in
the weeds for days, years,

40:50.676 --> 40:51.931
Waiting to strike.

40:52.008 --> 40:54.832
That verbal diarrhea,

40:54.905 --> 40:57.130
When you got something in
that head of yours, Janice,

40:57.207 --> 40:59.702
You give yourself away. What
are you saying about my husband?

40:59.778 --> 41:01.070
What-- What did
I say?

41:01.135 --> 41:03.033
I don't know what goes
on in your house,

41:03.106 --> 41:07.571
But for your information, Tony has
never raised his hand to his children.

41:07.638 --> 41:09.200
Nothing goes on
in my house.

41:09.277 --> 41:12.100
- Or to me.
- Fine.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.631
But you know what,
I take that back.

41:17.707 --> 41:21.631
Once he slapped AJ,
and he felt horrible about it--

41:21.708 --> 41:22.931
For days.

41:24.875 --> 41:27.272
Bobby took advanta of him
last night

41:27.336 --> 41:28.970
When Tony had had
too much to drink.

41:29.038 --> 41:31.833
There is no excuse for the way
Bobby blindsided him.

41:36.106 --> 41:39.273
Tony is not
a vindictive man.

41:43.676 --> 41:45.530
What did I say?

42:01.076 --> 42:03.970
You had a pretty good success
with the lipitor, right?

42:04.038 --> 42:07.972
Well, at this moment we could
also sell to you fosamax.

42:08.035 --> 42:10.832
Medication for...

42:10.908 --> 42:14.003
osteo-- Osteporose, you know,
for the women, their bones.

42:14.075 --> 42:16.870
Now, o month's
supply of fosamax,

42:16.935 --> 42:18.800
<i>Four pilules --
Pills,</i>

42:18.877 --> 42:22.230
Sells for $70 us
from the pharmacy.

42:22.308 --> 42:26.503
We sell four pills
to you for $10 us.

42:26.576 --> 42:28.573
<i>- What, are they counterfeit?
- No no no.</i>

42:28.635 --> 42:31.173
They're true. They're
from assurance maladie,

42:31.235 --> 42:34.803
<i>But expiree,--
Like, old.</i>

42:34.875 --> 42:37.072
Change the date,
nobody knows.

42:40.638 --> 42:44.403
How much... fosamax
can you get?

42:44.476 --> 42:47.830
20,000 pills
every three months.

42:47.908 --> 42:50.232
There some way we could
get you to lower your price?

42:50.308 --> 42:51.730
You already make
a big profit.

42:51.805 --> 42:53.171
That's a good deal.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.671
And we'll give you the first
pills in one week, Monday.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.900
What?

43:01.976 --> 43:04.702
I cannot come
the week next

43:04.777 --> 43:07.632
<i>Because ma soeur--
My sister,</i>

43:07.706 --> 43:09.571
She has problems
in the court.

43:09.636 --> 43:10.903
She got a good lawyer?

43:11.007 --> 43:12.430
Makes all the difference.

43:12.506 --> 43:15.530
Her old husband, he wants to
take the child they have together

43:15.608 --> 43:18.001
To winnipeg, because
he's some drummer over there.

43:18.075 --> 43:20.401
- Can you believe this?
- She never see her son.

43:20.476 --> 43:22.971
Separate a child
from his mother?

43:23.035 --> 43:25.430
I mean, what kind
of person does this?

43:25.505 --> 43:29.130
<i>I would give anything to be,
you know, debarasse of this shit.</i>

43:29.205 --> 43:31.270
To have him gone
from her life--

43:31.336 --> 43:33.203
<i>That's tough
talk, bon ami.</i>

43:33.278 --> 43:35.902
I'm really serious.

43:37.336 --> 43:39.330
I tell you what:

43:39.408 --> 43:42.171
<i>You knock your price
down to 35 grande</i>

43:42.237 --> 43:45.803
And we'll see what we can do about
making your sister's custody problem...

43:45.878 --> 43:47.303
go away.

43:49.207 --> 43:51.301
And I'm not talking
about a lawyer, either.

43:51.376 --> 43:53.270
<i>Now, who does this?</i>

43:53.336 --> 43:55.500
You pay to some
drug addict?

43:55.576 --> 43:57.900
No, somebody reliable.

44:00.636 --> 44:03.101
We got to talk.

44:06.136 --> 44:09.531
You'll take care
of this, right?

44:13.376 --> 44:15.131
Sure.

44:16.235 --> 44:18.070
No bow and arrows now.

44:25.336 --> 44:27.473
<i>Ooh.</i>

44:31.775 --> 44:33.400
Nice, huh?

44:49.936 --> 44:52.000
Bobby...

44:52.075 --> 44:54.232
hi, hi.

44:54.306 --> 44:56.271
Mwah!

44:56.338 --> 44:57.500
Oh, how was the game?

44:57.576 --> 44:59.300
Oh, you know,
he held his own, but...

44:59.375 --> 45:00.832
must have been
the new clubs.

45:00.907 --> 45:02.703
- Yeah.
- Do you want to eat something?

45:02.775 --> 45:05.571
No no, I figure we
should hit the road,

45:05.636 --> 45:07.300
Beat the traffic.

45:07.377 --> 45:08.733
Okay.

45:14.578 --> 45:17.072
You let him win.
Smart.

45:23.536 --> 45:25.131
Drive carefully.

45:26.608 --> 45:28.901
Here.

45:28.977 --> 45:31.031
Thanks again
for my present.

45:31.108 --> 45:34.270
Oh, wait till you see the shots
of aunt gemma from the '60s.

45:34.337 --> 45:36.933
You forget what a beauty
she was before the steroids.

45:37.006 --> 45:39.400
- Bobby, you're a wonderful host.
- It was our pleasure.

45:39.476 --> 45:42.002
Gobye. When nica
wakes up from her nap,

45:42.077 --> 45:43.731
Give her a belly
smooch from us.

45:43.806 --> 45:45.931
Okay. Bye.

46:00.208 --> 46:02.801
He broke your balls about
the fight, didn't he?

46:04.808 --> 46:06.502
No, he didn't.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.130
<i>Bobby?</i>

46:14.206 --> 46:15.502
Where are you going?

46:15.577 --> 46:17.071
- It's business, jan.
- Now?

46:17.138 --> 46:19.201
- Yeah.
- Well, when are you coming back?

46:19.276 --> 46:20.800
I'm not sure.
A couple days.

46:20.875 --> 46:23.131
A couple of days? The
salernos are coming tomorrow.

46:23.205 --> 46:25.000
Stop fucking nagging me.

46:25.075 --> 46:27.302
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

46:48.936 --> 46:51.302
<i>- Allo, natalie.
- Salut.</i>

47:53.537 --> 47:54.800
Yeah?

47:54.876 --> 47:56.731
<i>Some news about this gun charge:</i>

47:56.805 --> 47:59.233
<i>- It's not going away.
- You said they dropped it.</i>

47:59.308 --> 48:02.371
Essex county did, but now looks
like the feds took it over.

48:02.435 --> 48:03.672
<i>Fuck.</i>

48:03.736 --> 48:06.331
What happened to
"it's a piece-Of-Shit case"?

48:06.408 --> 48:08.633
It is.
Unwinnable.

48:08.706 --> 48:11.701
But fold it into a Rico,
it adds a predicate.

48:11.775 --> 48:14.301
Good news is if they
had what they needed

48:14.377 --> 48:17.030
We'd be having this
conversation through glass.

48:17.106 --> 48:19.173
I gotta go.

49:02.075 --> 49:03.833
Girls, let's do
the tea now.

49:05.977 --> 49:08.002
Pour a little
for Jamie too.

49:13.006 --> 49:15.832
- Bobby, finally!
- Hey, Bobby.

49:15.906 --> 49:17.432
Daddy!
