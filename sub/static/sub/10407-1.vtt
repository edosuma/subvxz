30:25.184 --> 30:27.472
<i>Don't worry, he will ring.</i>

31:10.979 --> 31:12.307
Stop them!

31:14.649 --> 31:16.024
Vandals!

31:24.784 --> 31:26.860
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

Come on.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.094

32:34.978 --> 32:37.184
Do you have some proper music?

32:37.438 --> 32:40.011
<i>Something that I'd like to listen to.</i>

32:55.331 --> 32:57.656
Okay, never mind. Bye.

36:42.929 --> 36:44.589
To Cannes?

38:28.283 --> 38:29.314
Damn!

41:25.415 --> 41:26.743
<i>What the...</i>

Good.

Oh, yeah!

48:59.401 --> 49:01.441
Cut! Cut! Cut!

49:02.571 --> 49:05.774
What the hell is he doing?
Where did he come from?

49:05.866 --> 49:08.403
Some of us here
are trying to make a work of art!

49:09.787 --> 49:11.863
Everyone, back in position!

49:15.584 --> 49:19.451
Get him in something different
and put him in the background.

49:19.546 --> 49:22.167
You, sweetheart. You never stop, okay?

49:24.426 --> 49:28.673
<i>Remember, you're crazy
for the taste of Fruzzi yogurt.</i>

49:37.522 --> 49:39.847
Well, how long does it take to reset?

49:55.081 --> 49:58.616
Then why is everyone
moving in slow motion?

50:42.461 --> 50:43.836
<i>Yeah, there's a hook.</i>

50:48.050 --> 50:52.296
Cannes jury member Emil Dachevsky,
the Russian film director,

50:52.679 --> 50:58.302
explained that his son Stepan was last seen
on a train with a mysterious foreigner.

51:00.896 --> 51:03.303
<i>As soon as I saw him I thought, "He's evil."</i>

51:03.648 --> 51:04.679
Action!

51:16.411 --> 51:17.490
Cut!

51:20.164 --> 51:22.572
The guy with the video camera is fired.

51:29.466 --> 51:30.746
<i>You're fired!</i>

51:30.842 --> 51:31.873
What?

51:32.635 --> 51:34.010
Down again!

51:50.277 --> 51:52.104
- Are you ready?
- Yep.

51:52.196 --> 51:53.441
Action!

52:02.289 --> 52:03.997
Cut! Cut! Cut!

52:05.417 --> 52:06.876
My explosion!

52:07.878 --> 52:09.289
<i>Where's my explosion?</i>

52:10.547 --> 52:14.212
All I want is an explosion.
A little, tiny explosion.

52:15.136 --> 52:16.167
Is that too much to ask?

52:18.013 --> 52:19.211
Damn it.

52:21.892 --> 52:23.849
Is it really so hard for you guys?

52:23.935 --> 52:26.473
I mean, all you have to do is this.

53:34.588 --> 53:35.703
Hello.

53:37.007 --> 53:39.676
You saved my life earlier.

53:44.097 --> 53:45.425
Going far?

53:48.519 --> 53:50.143
<i>Isn't she a beauty?</i>

53:54.983 --> 53:56.181
Dunlop.

54:01.489 --> 54:03.232
<i>I'm going to Cannes.</i>

54:04.117 --> 54:06.026
Cannes. Cannes.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.577
Come on, get in.

54:21.718 --> 54:22.963
Look at this.

54:30.393 --> 54:32.219
<i>So, you're Spanish?</i>

54:33.520 --> 54:34.635
No?

54:36.232 --> 54:38.141
What is that accent?

54:38.734 --> 54:39.932
Wait.

54:40.069 --> 54:41.777
Let me guess.

54:43.656 --> 54:45.150
<i>You're not Italian?</i>

54:45.240 --> 54:46.569
- No.
- No.

54:47.242 --> 54:48.273
No.

54:48.577 --> 54:51.412
<i>And you're not Greek, no?</i>

54:53.916 --> 54:56.407
<i>You are...</i>

55:00.047 --> 55:02.454
<i>You're Russian, yes?</i>

55:07.429 --> 55:12.424
- What kind of idiot are you?
- What kind of duck are you?

55:27.115 --> 55:28.942
My name is Sabine.

55:30.618 --> 55:33.323
<i>I am Sabine... And you are?</i>

55:35.623 --> 55:36.738
Bean.

55:36.958 --> 55:38.072
Bean?

55:38.794 --> 55:39.873
Bean.

55:40.462 --> 55:41.956
Bean. Sabine.

55:42.964 --> 55:44.423
Bean. Sabine.

55:44.674 --> 55:47.877
Bean, Sabine. Bean, Sabine. Bean, Sabine.

55:53.683 --> 55:54.798
Bean, Sabine.

56:02.733 --> 56:04.690
Do you like my costumes?

56:05.110 --> 56:07.435
I love dressing up.

56:10.324 --> 56:13.444
My invitation to the Cannes Film Festival.

56:13.786 --> 56:16.537
Remember the director
of the yogurt commercial?

56:19.374 --> 56:21.912
Cut. Cut.

56:26.632 --> 56:28.671
I have a small part in his film.

56:28.759 --> 56:30.633
<i>I'm going to be a big star.</i>

56:31.803 --> 56:33.962
<i>He says it's his masterpiece.</i>

56:34.890 --> 56:36.514
I need the loo.

56:36.975 --> 56:38.220
Sorry.

57:21.811 --> 57:23.684
I never got on the bus.

57:24.355 --> 57:26.892
I was with these cool guys.

57:27.192 --> 57:28.520
Hello.

58:10.025 --> 58:12.515
<i>I can't wait to show this to Papa.</i>

58:13.570 --> 58:16.322
<i>It's amazing meeting your son like that.</i>

58:17.115 --> 58:19.072
Is she your girlfriend?

58:20.911 --> 58:22.903
<i>You're full of surprises.</i>

58:23.204 --> 58:25.244
Are you going to marry her?

58:25.331 --> 58:27.739
<i>So does that mean you're married?</i>

58:36.384 --> 58:38.258
Telephone! Papa!

59:24.181 --> 59:26.588
<i>Estelle, tell me you love me or it's over.</i>

01:03:48.106 --> 01:03:49.435
We made it.

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:01.191
The sea! I can see the sea!

01:04:13.799 --> 01:04:16.124
Thank you.

01:04:20.972 --> 01:04:23.463

01:08:25.837 --> 01:08:27.331
And the beach?

01:08:28.256 --> 01:08:29.585
Forget the beach.

01:08:29.674 --> 01:08:33.457
I have only one scene in this movie.
I am not going to miss this premiere.

01:08:33.553 --> 01:08:36.174
Not for you, not for the police. Okay?

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:38.674
Now, do as I say.

01:08:57.285 --> 01:08:58.779
My daughter.

01:09:03.666 --> 01:09:05.907
My mother.

01:09:15.136 --> 01:09:16.464
<i>She's Spanish,</i>

01:09:20.307 --> 01:09:21.966
and very deaf.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.841
<i>Sir, we're in a great hurry.</i>

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:28.352
<i>I don't want to miss my premiere.</i>

01:09:29.984 --> 01:09:31.727
No problem. Leave it to us.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.456
<i>Come on, we'll find Papa.</i>

01:09:57.469 --> 01:09:59.177
Here you are, sir.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.673
<i>It's for one person only.</i>

01:10:02.974 --> 01:10:04.516
<i>No, she's my daughter! Please!</i>

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:06.510
Leave her with Grandma.

01:10:13.693 --> 01:10:14.856
Damn!

01:10:38.092 --> 01:10:41.923
<i>What is life
but a teardrop in the eye of infinity?</i>

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.472
<i>Together we lived, we laughed, we loved.</i>

01:10:51.063 --> 01:10:53.186
<i>But you left me.</i>

01:10:54.358 --> 01:10:57.892
<i>And now, I walk this wilderness alone.</i>

01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:18.792
<i>What use is a cop with a broken heart?</i>

01:11:20.592 --> 01:11:23.165
<i>Without you, I'm nothing.</i>

01:11:23.636 --> 01:11:26.637
<i>Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.</i>

01:11:27.765 --> 01:11:31.513
<i>Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.</i>

01:11:33.605 --> 01:11:34.636
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:38.098
Stop!

01:11:40.278 --> 01:11:42.851
Your pass, please, madam.

01:11:59.963 --> 01:12:05.384
<i>The Romans lit fires in the skulls
of their dead so they might forget their past.</i>

01:12:06.679 --> 01:12:12.053
<i>Wherever I look,
I'm reminded our relationship is dead.</i>

01:12:24.404 --> 01:12:26.693
<i>- You stay.
- You okay?</i>

01:12:26.782 --> 01:12:28.441
Me, Papa.

01:12:28.533 --> 01:12:30.158
<i>On the outside, yeah.</i>

01:12:31.161 --> 01:12:32.655
<i>But inside?</i>

01:12:35.624 --> 01:12:36.655
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:12:46.676 --> 01:12:48.549
<i>DeBrock is making the drop.</i>

01:12:49.846 --> 01:12:50.878
<i>Boss...</i>

01:12:53.516 --> 01:12:55.343
<i>It's going down, boss.</i>

01:12:55.894 --> 01:12:57.222
<i>It's me.</i>

01:12:58.855 --> 01:12:59.886
<i>Boss?</i>

01:13:01.524 --> 01:13:02.555
<i>Do we go?</i>

01:13:03.192 --> 01:13:04.734
<i>He's cornered, boss.</i>

01:13:05.737 --> 01:13:07.528
<i>We know he's in there.</i>

01:13:12.368 --> 01:13:13.531
<i>Let's do it.</i>

01:13:24.755 --> 01:13:26.036
<i>Okay, boss.</i>

01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:28.789
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:13:31.512 --> 01:13:32.543
Hey.

01:13:33.472 --> 01:13:34.752
The little boy?

01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:38.559
Oh, look, this is my scene.

01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:42.063
<i>It's winter now.</i>

01:13:42.273 --> 01:13:45.357
<i>And the seeds of love lie deep within me.</i>

01:13:45.901 --> 01:13:48.189
<i>Will spring ever come?</i>

01:13:49.154 --> 01:13:51.823
<i>I thought by now I'd have met another,</i>

01:13:52.616 --> 01:13:53.814
<i>- but...
- Hi...</i>

01:13:54.618 --> 01:13:56.196
<i>It was not to be.</i>

01:13:59.831 --> 01:14:01.290
They cut my scene.

01:14:06.672 --> 01:14:10.621
<i>But I can show the world
that you were once mine.</i>

01:14:11.301 --> 01:14:14.218
<i>I can relive our time together.</i>

01:14:14.304 --> 01:14:17.720
<i>Those precious memories
that I yearn to forget.</i>

01:14:24.856 --> 01:14:28.307
<i>Time slips through my fingers like sand.</i>

01:14:42.915 --> 01:14:47.127
<i>The fires of our love have burned out,
and now there is nothing.</i>

01:14:48.087 --> 01:14:52.167
<i>Nothing but a sky black with ashes.</i>

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:56.917
<i>I won't forget you, your kisses like soft fruit.</i>

01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:01.928
<i>Your laughter bursting into daylight
like silver.</i>

01:15:02.768 --> 01:15:07.679
<i>Your smile like the curl of the sickle moon
in the night sky.</i>

01:15:13.821 --> 01:15:18.198
<i>Your luminous beauty, your goodness,
your patience,</i>

01:15:19.368 --> 01:15:21.775
<i>how you hung on my every word.</i>

01:15:29.253 --> 01:15:32.206
<i>You are now in the arms of another.</i>

01:15:32.756 --> 01:15:35.044
<i>Who is he, this man?</i>

01:15:36.885 --> 01:15:38.544
<i>Does he have poise?</i>

01:15:38.803 --> 01:15:40.594
<i>Does he have grace?</i>

01:15:40.681 --> 01:15:42.922
<i>Is he a lover or a fighter?</i>

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.054
<i>What powers does he have over you?</i>

01:15:46.686 --> 01:15:50.470
<i>Do your eyes dance like fireflies in the night
when he comes to you?</i>

01:15:51.566 --> 01:15:55.943
<i>Does your body soften
as your lips shape his name?</i>

01:16:00.408 --> 01:16:03.907
<i>I can't believe you've been so selfish.</i>

01:16:07.289 --> 01:16:08.784
Open the door.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.031
Open up!

01:16:11.168 --> 01:16:13.042
<i>You are consumed by love.</i>

01:16:13.129 --> 01:16:14.707
<i>It's Mr Carson Clay.</i>

01:16:23.097 --> 01:16:25.718
<i>How does he cast a spell over you,</i>

01:16:25.807 --> 01:16:28.725
<i>enchant you, beguile you?</i>

01:16:30.271 --> 01:16:32.310
<i>Why did you shut me out?</i>

01:16:50.499 --> 01:16:51.909
Come on. Come on.

01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:03.255
Where is he?

01:17:04.179 --> 01:17:05.970
<i>Where's the projectionist?</i>

01:17:06.056 --> 01:17:07.929
<i>I struggled to survive.</i>

01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:12.473
<i>When I look back
on the darkest moments of our history,</i>

01:17:13.187 --> 01:17:15.144
<i>I knew that we would part.</i>

01:17:15.232 --> 01:17:16.607
Whose is this?

01:17:16.691 --> 01:17:20.689
<i>And that now, I must let you go.</i>

01:17:24.407 --> 01:17:27.822
<i>We will know a deeper, surer love.</i>

01:17:28.285 --> 01:17:32.365
<i>It begins fleetingly,
but it deepens and endures.</i>

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:37.575
<i>It grows amidst all the strangeness of life.</i>

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.419
<i>It is a beauty we can always depend on.</i>

01:17:42.633 --> 01:17:46.298
<i>It is the beauty of friendship.</i>

01:18:04.572 --> 01:18:05.734
Stop!

01:18:06.699 --> 01:18:08.074
You stole my son!

01:18:08.867 --> 01:18:10.361
<i>No, he didn't!</i>

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:14.361
Where is my son? Where is he?

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.535
<i>That... Here...</i>

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.415
Papa!

01:18:31.472 --> 01:18:32.503
Mama!

01:18:52.952 --> 01:18:55.953
<i>A very strange thing happens
when you're making a work of art.</i>

01:18:56.038 --> 01:18:59.870
<i>Sometimes you don't quite
see the elements coming together,</i>

01:18:59.959 --> 01:19:02.876
<i>and then, when it all comes together,
there's something magical,</i>

01:19:02.962 --> 01:19:06.544
<i>something organic,
and such a thing happened today,</i>

01:19:06.633 --> 01:19:09.337
<i>and everyone said this wouldn't work.</i>

01:19:09.594 --> 01:19:11.586
<i>They said it was a terrible risk,</i>

01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:14.798
<i>but I want to keep on making films
just like this.</i>

01:19:15.099 --> 01:19:20.685
<i>The video-film combination, it's something
that's really been done before,</i>

01:19:20.771 --> 01:19:26.358
<i>but not quite like this.
I'm glad the reception was so great.</i>

01:19:26.777 --> 01:19:31.024
<i>And I'm just happy to be here.
Vive la France.</i>
