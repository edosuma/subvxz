10:28.261 --> 10:31.062
I'll admit
business has been slow.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.364
But we're gonna use the money

10:32.366 --> 10:33.832
to take our business
to the next level.

10:33.834 --> 10:38.236
Max had the genius idea
of making it a dessert bar.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.671
We still sell our cupcakes,

10:39.673 --> 10:42.073
but we also serve
high-end cocktails.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.642
You can just say
the word "muddle"

10:43.644 --> 10:45.744
and charge $20.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.980
That is a fantastic idea,
ladies.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.348
Wow, it's so great.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.449
Honey, do me a favor.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.984
Could you get me
some water?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.886
I want to stay hydrated
for tomorrow's matinee.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.722
There's talk of Robert Durst
transferring in just to see it,

10:57.724 --> 10:59.791
and I don't want
to jinx it, you know.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.262
Oh.
[chuckles]

11:04.264 --> 11:06.698
Wanted to ditch the square, huh?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.533
I get it.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.235
Is this finally happening?

11:10.237 --> 11:13.438
Celebration make-out sesh?

11:13.440 --> 11:17.676
Uh, yeah, we got to keep
our hands in plain view.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.278
This whole cupcake business
is not for Caroline.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.113
Well, she's not the baker;
I am.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.515
She's the idea person.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.817
Yeah, but you had
the dessert bar idea, right?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.420
And you just said
it was a terrific idea.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.089
Well, as you saw...
[chuckles]

11:31.091 --> 11:32.924
I'm a really good actor.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.027
Can I itch my nose?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.131
Look, my baby was brought up
around Wall Street.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.766
She's Wharton bred.

11:41.768 --> 11:45.603
She could never be happy doing
this whole baking business,

11:45.605 --> 11:47.405
and this is her big chance
to get out.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.107
But wouldn't she have
told me?

11:49.109 --> 11:52.343
She tells me every single
feeling she's having.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.113
And some of it,
I even listen to.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.015
What if I just ask her?

11:57.017 --> 11:58.249
She'll only deny it.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.484
She doesn't want
to hurt your feelings.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.985
That's why I'm doing it.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.388
But she said she was happy
about the dessert bar.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.923
We danced about it.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.725
Max, listen to me.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.160
I'm her father,
and I know her.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.929
And this is her big chance.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.931
You just got to let her go.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.399
I do?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.201
Yeah, and you got
to be firm about it,

12:16.203 --> 12:17.602
or she's not going
to get the message.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.137
Like in "Poltergeist,"

12:19.139 --> 12:21.673
where they have to be
really stern with Carol Anne

12:21.675 --> 12:24.576
or else she'll stay
with the ghosts?

12:24.578 --> 12:27.345
And I'm the ghosts?

12:30.883 --> 12:32.817
Ooch!

12:34.353 --> 12:35.620
Max, what is going on with you?

12:35.622 --> 12:36.855
Are you all right?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.323
I'm fine.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.225
I'm just making
Sophie's gender cake.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.128
If you don't want to be here,
go back to Wall Street.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.629
What?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.431
What is going on with you?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.833
You've been pouty ever since
we left the prison.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.401
I'm not gonna
take you there anymore

12:50.403 --> 12:53.037
if you're sad to leave.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.172
You know what?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.775
While I'm doing all the work,

12:56.777 --> 13:00.111
why don't you go get me
the gender envelope?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.648
Okay, Moody Giuliani.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.455
Do not tell me
you lost the envelope

13:10.457 --> 13:12.524
with the gender
of Sophie's baby in there.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.292
I didn't lose it.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.593
I just don't have it,

13:15.595 --> 13:18.496
and I don't know
where it is.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.665
Oh, we probably left it
at the prison

13:20.667 --> 13:22.400
when you made me
get out the playbill.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.636
Oh, so this is my fault.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.405
The one thing you had to do,
you didn't do.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.440
Like a waitress
at a vegan restaurant,

13:29.442 --> 13:32.811
you're bringing
almost nothing to the table.

13:32.813 --> 13:37.015
The $250,000
I'm bringing to the table,

13:37.017 --> 13:38.149
that's nothing?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.318
Oh, so that's your money.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.753
There it is.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.388
So why don't you take
your money

13:43.390 --> 13:44.856
and go back to Wall Street?

13:44.858 --> 13:46.157
I'll be fine.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.526
Who came up with combining
desserts and alcohol?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.329
I mean, obviously,
you've been holding me back.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.232
<i>I've</i> been holding <i>you</i> back?

13:54.234 --> 13:57.902
You forgot to wear pants
to a business meeting.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.671
How dare you?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.272
I did wear pants.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.274
I just left them
in the bathroom.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.976
[gasps]

14:04.978 --> 14:07.779
Okay, well...

14:09.448 --> 14:12.917
Well, this is
a historic event.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.286
We've sold cupcakes
for five years,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.956
and this is the first time
you've touched batter.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.725
It's a historic event

14:20.727 --> 14:23.728
because you finally had
a business idea

14:23.730 --> 14:26.197
that didn't have
the word "fart" in it.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.532
[gasps]

14:28.767 --> 14:31.269
If my hair gets involved,
we are done.

Hey, what a nice surprise.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.098
You know what else
is a surprise?

15:00.100 --> 15:03.034
That the makeup lights
in a prison are so flattering.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.840
I don't remember him
being in the show.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.174
Yeah, he's not.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.144
He's just a felon
who likes false eyelashes.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.379
So what are you doing here?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.347
I think I left
an important envelope here.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.548
I tried calling, but they said

15:17.550 --> 15:19.250
your phone privileges
were taken away.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.485
Yeah, well, I had a fight

15:20.487 --> 15:21.920
with the prison theater critic.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.688
That's the headline
you go with, Eddie?

15:23.690 --> 15:26.124
"Shanks for Nothing"?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.725
He sure is a big man
on his blog,

15:27.727 --> 15:29.928
but he can't look me
in the eye.

15:29.930 --> 15:34.766
Well, I would have gone
with "It's A Prison Riot."

15:34.768 --> 15:36.834
I think I left
an envelope here,

15:36.836 --> 15:39.470
and I think it ruined
me and Max's friendship

15:39.472 --> 15:41.072
and our partnership.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.007
All right, well,
here you go.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.142
Here's your envelope,

15:44.144 --> 15:46.644

15:47.813 --> 15:49.013
Hey, um...

15:49.015 --> 15:51.349
I'm real sorry to hear
about you and Max.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.650
Yeah.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.619
Unless maybe
it's a good thing

15:54.621 --> 15:55.987
and it's happening
for the best

15:55.989 --> 15:57.488
and you get to go back
to Wall Street

15:57.490 --> 15:59.023
and reclaim your life.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.391
Wall Street?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.627
Why does every single person
keep telling me

16:02.629 --> 16:04.262
to go back to Wall Street?

16:04.264 --> 16:06.264
Max, you--

16:06.266 --> 16:09.100
all right,
it's just Max and you.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.069
Here. Let me do that.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.603
Okay.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.038
Listen, honey.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.374
You only have to work
on Wall Street, okay?

16:16.376 --> 16:17.976
You can live
on the Upper East Side

16:17.978 --> 16:19.510
and eventually move
to Westchester

16:19.512 --> 16:21.579
if you want a tennis court.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.015
Daddy, did you and Max
talk about this?

16:24.017 --> 16:27.518
Kitten, I know you
better than anybody,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.287
and I know
that you do not belong

16:29.289 --> 16:31.456
in a cupcake shop
in Brooklyn.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.024
You could still be friends
with Max.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.259
She like tennis?

16:35.261 --> 16:37.261
How do you know
where I belong?

16:37.263 --> 16:38.930
Go like this.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.799
[chuckles]

16:41.801 --> 16:46.170
I'm not the same spoiled
little rich girl that I was.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.306
Well, now you can be.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.474
These last five years

16:49.476 --> 16:51.042
have made me
a different person.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.410
For example, when I walk

16:52.412 --> 16:54.379
into a combination
Taco Bell-Dunkin' Donuts,

16:54.381 --> 16:55.546
you know what they say?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.315
"Hi, Caroline."

16:57.317 --> 16:59.117
Son of a bitch.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.486
See, Daddy,
I'm Taco Bell,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.021
and Max is Dunkin' Donuts.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.656
On the surface, it seems like
we shouldn't be together,

17:05.658 --> 17:08.493
but we make an amazing team.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.428
And we have a dream together.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.965
It's not just hers;
it's mine too.

17:13.967 --> 17:17.869
Well, that's the hardest thing
I've had to take in all day.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.972
And for lunch, they served us
something called "brown."

17:20.974 --> 17:23.808
See, Daddy,
this is where I belong.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.311
Well, not here, even though
I will miss the lighting,

17:27.313 --> 17:29.013
but with Max.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.182
Well...

17:31.184 --> 17:33.518
I guess I can support that.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.053
Look, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.187
You know, I worry, okay?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.388
That's what parents do,

17:37.390 --> 17:38.790
and there's lots of time
to worry

17:38.792 --> 17:40.124
when you're in prison,

17:40.126 --> 17:43.227
which is why I focused
all my energies

17:43.229 --> 17:48.166
on creating groundbreaking
musical theater.

I threw in the garbage.

I didn't wait this long
for the polio vaccine.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.940
There's a polio vaccine?

18:28.942 --> 18:31.576
Well, you might have to wait
a little longer

18:31.578 --> 18:33.111
to find out the sex
of the baby,

18:33.113 --> 18:35.947

a new business announcement too.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.149
Is it about me firing you?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.984
Because I already reserved
a karaoke machine

18:39.986 --> 18:41.719
for your Good Riddance party.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.789
I'm not saying cancel it,
but you can't fire us

18:44.791 --> 18:47.725
till we have our new
business idea up and running.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.494

What does that mean?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.082
Well, it means it has a chance

19:45.084 --> 19:48.686
of getting nominated
for Academy Awards.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.190
Oh, no!

19:52.192 --> 19:54.025
I was so busy putting out
that oven mitt fire,

19:54.027 --> 19:55.760
I forgot to put
the color in it.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.195
But I could just tell
everybody.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.530
No, 'cause if
I hear it from you,

19:59.532 --> 20:02.533
I'll already be mad
at the baby.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.768
You know what, Sophie?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.236
Maybe it's a sign

20:05.238 --> 20:07.738
that we shouldn't know
what the baby's gonna be.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.207
You're right.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.875
Keep the cake, girls.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.076
We're not gonna pay.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.115
Well, do you guys want
to try it?

20:18.117 --> 20:19.083
No, thanks.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.952
I've got a lady
coming over.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.188
We're gonna try to figure out
how Netflix works

20:24.190 --> 20:25.323
and chill.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.061
I also have
a lady coming over.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.531
Yes, it's a lesbian masseuse
for my ferret,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.333
but it counts.

20:36.535 --> 20:37.802
I guess you're the only one

20:37.804 --> 20:39.804
who's gonna taste
my first cake.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.641
I also have a lady coming over,
question mark.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.943
Come on. One bite.

20:48.046 --> 20:49.614
Wow.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.949
Could you dial 911, please?
