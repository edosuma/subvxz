25:22.800 --> 25:23.533
OH, DO YOU
HAVE IT NOW ?

25:23.567 --> 25:24.900
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

25:24.933 --> 25:27.133
I KNOW, ALL DURING REHEARSAL
HE WAS GOING LIKE THIS,

25:27.167 --> 25:28.667
WHERE'S MY WATCH,
WHERE'S MY WATCH ?

25:28.700 --> 25:29.767
DID YOU LEAVE IT
AT THE HOTEL ?

25:29.800 --> 25:32.367
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE ?

25:32.400 --> 25:33.733
ARE YOU KIDDING
OR YOU REALLY FOUND IT ?

25:33.767 --> 25:36.333
NO, I FOUND IT, AND I,
AND I HAD IT IN MY POCKET.

25:36.367 --> 25:38.967
THIS IS, DID YOU LOOK,
UH, MAYBE...

25:39.067 --> 25:40.600
YOU REMEMBER PUTTING IT
IN YOUR POCKET ?

25:40.633 --> 25:42.733
I PUT IT IN THIS
JACKET POCKET.

25:42.767 --> 25:43.767
THAT JACKET.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.533
WHAT, YOU
LOST THE WATCH ?

25:47.567 --> 25:50.967
OH GEE, I GUESS I LOST
THE WATCH, UH, I'M SORRY.

25:51.067 --> 25:52.133
YOU LOST...

25:52.167 --> 25:53.600
SO MAYBE
IT'S IN THE CAB.

25:53.633 --> 25:55.267
IT COULD DROP
OUT OF THE POCKET.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.167
WELL, IF THAT
HAPPENED THEN...

25:57.200 --> 25:58.833
DID YOU TAKE YOUR JACKET
OFF IN THE CAB ?

25:58.867 --> 26:00.067
NO.

26:00.067 --> 26:01.633
WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO COMPREHEND THIS, YOU,

26:01.667 --> 26:04.933
YOU LOST MY WATCH THAT YOU
HAD LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO

26:04.967 --> 26:06.600
IN YOUR HANDS,
CORRECT ?

26:06.633 --> 26:08.767
YEAH, SORRY.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.233
WELL, YOU OWE ME
A WATCH.

26:11.267 --> 26:12.400
WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS ?

26:12.433 --> 26:14.467
YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
A WATCH TO BEGIN WITH,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.600
SO YOU'RE IN THE SAME POSITION
YOU WERE, THERE'S NO CHANGE.

26:16.633 --> 26:19.233
UH, IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT,
YOU HAD MY WATCH,

26:19.267 --> 26:20.800
YOU HAD POSSESSION OF
MY WATCH AND NOW YOU DON'T.

26:20.833 --> 26:21.933
LOST WATCH.

26:21.967 --> 26:23.133
THE WATCH WAS LOST ?

26:23.167 --> 26:24.733
SO IT CONTINUES
TO BE LOST.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.133
WHAT CAN I SAY,
I'M, I'M...

26:26.167 --> 26:28.500
YOU CAN SAY, YOU CAN
SAY I'M SORRY

26:28.533 --> 26:29.733
AND I'LL BUY YOU
A NEW WATCH.

26:29.767 --> 26:31.067
BUY YOU A NEW WATCH ?!

26:31.067 --> 26:32.500
YEAH.

26:32.533 --> 26:34.867
IT WAS A LOST WATCH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE THE WATCH, RIGHT ?

26:34.900 --> 26:36.833
ABSOLUTELY, NO.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.333
HE FOUND THE WATCH,
SO HE HAD THE WATCH.

26:38.367 --> 26:39.600
HE FOUND
THE WATCH AND...

26:39.633 --> 26:40.700
THE WATCH WAS THERE,
HE HAD IT.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.900
DAVID LOST THE WATCH.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.933
DAVID LOST THE WATCH,
WHO FOUND THE WATCH ?

26:43.967 --> 26:45.067
WHY IS DAVID
THIS UPSET NOW ?

26:45.100 --> 26:48.800
HE'S UPSET,
HE'S SO EMOTIONAL.

26:48.833 --> 26:49.667
OR BECAUSE
IT'S NOT YOUR WATCH.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.900
HE DID NOT
INTENTIONALLY LOSE IT.

26:52.933 --> 26:54.567
'CAUSE HE LOST IT FIRST...

26:54.600 --> 26:56.267
POSSESSION IS 9/10ths...

26:56.300 --> 26:58.133
IF THE WATCH HAD
NEVER BEEN LOST...

26:58.167 --> 27:00.300
HEY, HEY, ALRIGHT,
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,

27:00.333 --> 27:02.600
WE MUST GO ON HERE,
WE HAVE A SHOW TO DO.

27:02.633 --> 27:05.533
MAX AND LEO HAVE
GOT TO GET ALONG,

27:05.567 --> 27:07.067
THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE SHOW IS THAT

27:07.067 --> 27:08.533

MUSICAL IS THAT JOURNEY,

27:12.133 --> 27:15.067

SUCCESSFUL PRODUCERS,

27:15.067 --> 27:16.667

WONDERFUL FRIENDS.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.267
NOW, WE CAN'T LET
WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE

27:19.300 --> 27:20.433
COME INTO THIS SHOW.

27:20.467 --> 27:21.600
( David )
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

27:21.633 --> 27:22.367
ALRIGHT ?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

27:23.733 --> 27:25.133
OH, I'M JUST
ARRANGING SOME--

27:25.167 --> 27:27.233
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE BUILDING
A SAND CASTLE ON THE TABLE.

27:27.267 --> 27:29.133
WELL, LET'S
START TO READ.

27:29.167 --> 27:32.667
NOW, UH FELLAS, THE ONE THING
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS

27:32.700 --> 27:33.533
THAT OPENING SCENE.

27:33.567 --> 27:34.800
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

27:34.833 --> 27:38.700
I JUST GOTTA WASH MY HANDS,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

27:38.733 --> 27:40.767
I DON'T KNOW,
WE NEED TO GET STARTED.

27:40.800 --> 27:41.600
HAVE YOU NOTICED ?

27:41.633 --> 27:42.800
LET ME SAY
ONE THING.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.200
HAVE YOU NOTICED HIM
DOING STUFF LIKE THIS ?

27:44.233 --> 27:47.600
I HAVE NOTICED AND HE'S WASHING
HIS HANDS MORE AND MORE.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.567
SOME PEOPLE GET NERVOUS
THEY WASH THEIR HANDS.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.433
IT'S A QUIRK, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE HAVE QUIRKS.

27:53.467 --> 27:54.133
OKAY.

27:57.967 --> 28:01.933
ALRIGHT, SO NOW ABOUT THAT
FIRST SCENE, THE THING IS,

28:01.967 --> 28:04.233
YOU HAVE TO DRIVE
THAT SCENE FORWARD.

28:04.267 --> 28:05.267
LARRY ?
YEAH.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.767
YES, SO YOU'VE GOT
TO PICK UP THE CUES.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.433
ALRIGHT, WHY DON'T WE GO
TO PAGE NINE IN THE SCRIPT,

28:10.467 --> 28:12.167
SEE IF WE CAN
GET STARTED HERE.

28:15.867 --> 28:18.567
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
I LOST IT ON PURPOSE, DID I ?

28:18.600 --> 28:21.367
I KNOW, HE'S, LIKE,
A LITTLE CRAZY OR SOMETHING.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.833
DID I TAKE HIS WATCH AND THROW
IT IN THE RIVER OR SOMETHING ?

28:23.867 --> 28:25.833
WELL, I MEAN, OF COURSE,
I WANTED TO KEEP THE WATCH

28:25.867 --> 28:27.300
I WAS EXCITED
I GOT IT FOR HIM.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.633
I KNOW, I DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.233
THAT'S SO CRAZY.
SO CRAZY, SO CRAZY.

28:34.233 --> 28:35.567
LARRY.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.067
OH !

29:26.600 --> 29:33.400
* OPENING NIGHT,
IT'S OPENING NIGHT *

30:04.433 --> 30:06.367
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS BIT, NATHAN,

30:06.400 --> 30:08.233
I'M CRAZY, AND I CAN'T,
WELL, WHY DID I SAY ?!

30:08.267 --> 30:10.800
STOP IT, JUST STOP IT,
I SAID STOP IT !

30:10.833 --> 30:13.900
NOW STAND UP !

30:13.933 --> 30:16.433
TAKE THIS
AND GO OUT THERE.

30:16.467 --> 30:18.967
YOU CAN DO IT !

30:19.000 --> 30:20.600
DON'T EVEN
LOOK BACK !

30:35.667 --> 30:37.300
HEY.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.033
YOU WANNA
GO OVER THERE ?

30:39.067 --> 30:40.133
WHAT, TO THE THEATER ?

30:40.167 --> 30:41.533
YEAH.

30:41.567 --> 30:44.100
ARE YOU CRAZY, IT'S, WE'VE GOT
LIKE, AN HOUR AND A HALF.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.367
AH, I THOUGHT I'D GET
THERE A LITTLE EARLIER.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.000
NO, I'M GONNA DO
SOME STRETCHING AND...

30:48.033 --> 30:49.067
ALRIGHT.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.967
YOU DO ANY KIND
OF WARM-UP, OR... ?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.900
WARM-UP ?

30:53.933 --> 30:54.767
LIKE WHAT,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

30:54.800 --> 30:56.367
LIKE STRETCHING,
UH... ?

30:56.400 --> 30:57.933
STRETCHING ?

30:57.967 --> 30:58.933
NEVER MIND.

30:58.967 --> 31:01.200
HEY, WHAT ABOUT, UM...

31:01.233 --> 31:05.067
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
REIMBURSING ME FOR THE WATCH ?

31:05.067 --> 31:07.200
IT SEEMS TO ME
YOUR WATCH WAS MISSING.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.067
I MEAN, WE'VE GONE
OVER THIS, BUT...

31:09.067 --> 31:11.233
IF I DIDN'T FIND YOUR WATCH
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

31:11.267 --> 31:12.567
THEN IT'S NOT
MINE TO LOSE.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.300
WHO HAD IT LAST ?

31:14.333 --> 31:17.567
YOU'RE IN THE SAME POSITION
NOW AS WHEN I STARTED.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.733
SO WHY AM I GETTING
BLAMED FOR IT ?

31:18.767 --> 31:19.967
I, I JUST DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN, YOU HAD IT.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.133
YOU LOST YOUR WATCH.

31:21.167 --> 31:24.467
LET'S NOT GET INTO IT,
WE HAVE A SHOW TO DO, OKAY ?

31:24.500 --> 31:25.067
AND BY THE WAY.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.500
YEAH ?

31:26.533 --> 31:28.067
YOU DID TELL
THE STEWARDESS

31:28.100 --> 31:29.233
THAT MY SEAT WASN'T IN
THE UPRIGHT POSITION, RIGHT ?

31:29.267 --> 31:31.367
OKAY, I'LL
SEE YOU, OKAY ?

31:50.467 --> 31:52.300
LARRY DAVID.

31:52.333 --> 31:53.967
I.

31:54.067 --> 31:55.267
I'M A NERVOUS WRECK.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.067
OH NO, THIS'LL BE EXCITING,
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

31:57.067 --> 31:59.700
I'M GONNA DESTROY
YOUR ENTIRE SHOW,
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?

31:59.733 --> 32:02.900
OH PLEASE, NO,
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB,
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE YOU.

32:02.933 --> 32:04.533
YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT THERE AND
HAVE, OH, THEY'RE JUST GONNA...

32:04.567 --> 32:05.933
WHY ARE THEY GONNA LOVE ME AND
PEOPLE DISLIKE ME INTENSELY ?

32:05.967 --> 32:07.233
YOU'LL DO GREAT, OH.

32:07.267 --> 32:08.533
THE AUDIENCE IS
NOT GONNA LOVE ME.

32:08.567 --> 32:09.800
YES, THEY ARE
GONNA LOVE YOU.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.633
MEL NEVER WOULD'VE
LET YOU DO THE SHOW.

32:11.667 --> 32:13.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE SO EARLY ?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.533
OH, I HAVE TO GET HERE EARLY
EVERY, UGH, SINGLE NIGHT,

32:15.567 --> 32:17.867
I DO HAVE RITUALS.

32:17.900 --> 32:19.567
OH, YOU GOT SOME OCDC'S,
OH, REALLY ?

32:19.600 --> 32:20.733
YEAH, LOTS OF THEM.

32:20.767 --> 32:21.800
WHAT DO YOU GOT ?

32:21.833 --> 32:24.700
OH GOD, PACING,
THEN I HAD PETAL COUNTING...

32:24.733 --> 32:26.100
YEAH, I THINK I'M GONNA
BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL,

32:26.133 --> 32:27.100
MAYBE 50 TIMES.

32:27.133 --> 32:28.200
YOU DON'T WANNA
DO THAT, LARRY.

32:28.233 --> 32:30.067
NO, I DO, I'M GONNA
BANG IT AGAINST THE WALL,

32:30.067 --> 32:32.233
'CAUSE MY MOTHER
USED TO SAY THAT TO ME
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

32:32.267 --> 32:33.233
YOU KNOW, GO BANG YOUR HEAD
AGAINST THE WALL.

32:33.267 --> 32:34.433
AND I TOOK IT
LITERALLY AND I DID,

32:34.467 --> 32:36.067
I USED TO BANG IT
AGAINST THE WALL.

32:36.067 --> 32:38.067
I THINK THAT'S WHY I GOT THIS
CONDITION IN THE FIRST PLACE,

32:38.100 --> 32:39.733
CAUSE I LISTENED
TO MY MOTHER.

32:39.767 --> 32:42.433
THANK YOU, BY THE WAY,
THAT WAS SO SWEET OF YOU

32:42.467 --> 32:44.500
WITH THE GUY WITH THE HANDBAG,
THAT WAS DANGEROUS.

32:44.533 --> 32:46.133
THAT WAS REALLY
DANGEROUS.

32:46.167 --> 32:46.967
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

32:47.067 --> 32:47.800
OH.

32:47.833 --> 32:48.500
HONESTLY.

32:48.533 --> 32:49.933
NO, YOU'RE SO SWEET.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.400
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT IT.

32:52.433 --> 32:53.300
HONEST TO GOD.

32:53.333 --> 32:55.067
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.433
WELL, THANKS.

32:56.467 --> 32:57.500
THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN MUCH.

32:57.533 --> 32:59.433
IF I DIDN'T GO INTO
SHOW BUSINESS, I WAS...

32:59.467 --> 33:01.067
I WAS GONNA
BECOME A FIREMAN.

33:04.767 --> 33:05.533
HMM.

33:05.567 --> 33:08.900
ALRIGHT.

33:08.933 --> 33:12.267
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THAT 10th ANNIVERSARY
PRESENT OF YOURS.

33:15.467 --> 33:18.333
YOU WANNA COME IN ?

33:18.367 --> 33:21.067
SURE.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.567
CLOSE THE DOOR.

33:28.433 --> 33:31.067

33:34.300 --> 33:36.067
WHAT IS THAT ?

33:36.100 --> 33:37.267

33:37.300 --> 33:39.100

33:41.533 --> 33:43.133
YEAH.

33:43.167 --> 33:47.567
HMM.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.067
YOU'VE GOT A PICTURE OF BUSH
IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM ?

33:50.067 --> 33:51.700
YEAH.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.100
HMM.

34:01.067 --> 34:03.167
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN ?

34:03.200 --> 34:06.133
YES, LARRY,
I'M A REPUBLICAN.

34:08.067 --> 34:10.367
UGH.

34:16.467 --> 34:19.067
WHAT THE FUCK
WERE YOU THINKING ?

34:19.067 --> 34:21.800
A PICTURE OF BUSH,
WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK ?

34:21.833 --> 34:24.733
I'D FUCK HER
WITH A BUSH MASK ON.

34:24.767 --> 34:26.333
YOU THINK THESE
GLASSES ARE OKAY ?

34:26.367 --> 34:27.667
DID I, I THINK
I MADE A MISTAKE,

34:27.700 --> 34:29.800
I LOOK LIKE I'M ABOUT
85 YEARS OLD IN THIS COSTUME,

34:29.833 --> 34:32.067
I SWEAR TO GOD,
LOOK AT ME.

34:32.100 --> 34:32.633

42:54.367 --> 42:57.233
HOW DARE THEY
INSULT ME IN THIS MANNER ?

42:57.267 --> 43:01.367
HOW QUICKLY THEY FORGET
I AM MAX BIALYSTOCK,

43:01.400 --> 43:05.533
THE FIRST PRODUCER EVER TO DO
SUMMER STOCK IN THE WINTER.

43:05.567 --> 43:08.100

YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MAN WHO
INVENTED THEATER IN THE SQUARE.

43:13.467 --> 43:15.233
NOBODY HAD
A GOOD SEAT.

43:15.267 --> 43:18.467
* KING OF OL' BROADWAY

43:18.500 --> 43:21.433
I SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE
IN THE THEATER.

43:21.467 --> 43:24.833
I WAS A PROTEGE OF THE GREAT
BORIS TOMACHEUSKY.

43:24.867 --> 43:27.900
( gasping )

43:27.933 --> 43:30.533
YES, HE TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

43:30.567 --> 43:32.533
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

43:32.567 --> 43:35.867
HE TURNED TO ME ON
HIS DEATHBED AND SAID,

43:35.900 --> 43:36.733
MAXELLA...

43:36.767 --> 43:42.133
( foreign language )

43:44.267 --> 43:46.200
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?

43:46.233 --> 43:48.867
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T SPEAK YIDDISH.

43:48.900 --> 43:51.800
STRANGELY ENOUGH,
NEITHER DID HE.

43:51.833 --> 43:55.233
IN MY HEART I KNEW
WHAT HE WAS SAYING,

43:55.267 --> 43:57.467
HE WAS SAYING WHEN
YOU'RE DOWN AND OUT

43:57.500 --> 44:00.067
AND EVERYBODY THINKS
YOU'RE FINISHED,

44:00.100 --> 44:03.567
THAT'S THE TIME TO STAND
ON YOUR TWO FEET AND SHOUT,

44:03.600 --> 44:06.133
WHO DO YOU GOTTA FUCK
TO GET A BREAK IN THIS TOWN ?

44:22.633 --> 44:24.667

* BIALYSTOCK WILL
BE ON TOP AGAIN *

44:46.933 --> 44:49.067
* HE'LL BE
ON TOP AGAIN *

44:49.100 --> 44:50.333

45:13.533 --> 45:14.967
MR. BIALYSTOCK.

45:15.067 --> 45:16.200
AH !

45:16.233 --> 45:17.667
WHO ARE YOU ?

45:17.700 --> 45:19.067
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

45:19.067 --> 45:20.467
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

45:20.500 --> 45:23.200
SPEAK TO ME,
DUMMY, SPEAK.

45:23.233 --> 45:25.100
WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK ?

45:25.133 --> 45:28.833
SCARED, CAN'T TALK.

45:28.867 --> 45:30.467
ALRIGHT, CALM DOWN.

45:30.500 --> 45:34.167
RELAX, GET A HOLD
OF YOURSELF.

45:34.200 --> 45:35.067
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

45:35.067 --> 45:39.767
( inhaling )
AHH...

45:39.800 --> 45:42.167
WHO ARE YOU ?

45:42.200 --> 45:44.600
I'M LEOPOLD BLOOM,
I'M AN ACCOUNTANT.

45:44.633 --> 45:45.700
I'M FROM
WHITEHALL AND MARX.

45:45.733 --> 45:47.767
I'VE COME HERE
TO DO YOUR BOOKS.

45:47.800 --> 45:50.333
OH, YOU HAVE,
HAVE YOU ?

45:53.400 --> 45:55.333
NOW, LET'S SEE.

45:55.367 --> 46:00.367
IF WE ADD THESE DEDUCTIONS,
WE GET, UH, OH.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.933
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

46:01.967 --> 46:04.867
BUT UNDER THE RIGHT
CIRCUMSTANCES A PRODUCER

46:04.900 --> 46:06.867
COULD MAKE MORE MONEY
WITH A FLOP

46:06.900 --> 46:11.100
THAN HE COULD
WITH A HIT.

46:11.133 --> 46:12.667
YES, IT'S QUITE
POSSIBLE.

46:12.700 --> 46:15.433
IF HE WERE CERTAIN
THAT THE SHOW WOULD FAIL,

46:15.467 --> 46:17.233
A MAN COULD
MAKE A FORTUNE.

46:17.267 --> 46:19.200
YES ?

46:19.233 --> 46:20.400
YES, WHAT ?

46:20.433 --> 46:22.133
WHAT YOU
WERE SAYING.

46:22.167 --> 46:23.200
KEEP TALKING.

46:23.233 --> 46:24.367
WHAT WAS I SAYING ?

46:24.400 --> 46:27.700
YOU WERE SAYING THAT UNDER
THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES,

46:35.833 --> 46:43.800
YOU WERE SAYING, THAT UNDER
THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES...

46:47.533 --> 46:49.633
WHAT WAS I SAYING ?

46:49.667 --> 46:52.667
THAT UNDER THE RIGHT
CIRCUMSTANCES...

46:52.700 --> 46:56.900
UNDER THE RIGHT
CIRCUMSTANCES...

46:56.933 --> 46:58.967
WHAT ?

46:59.067 --> 47:01.667
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

47:01.700 --> 47:03.533
WHAT ?

47:11.733 --> 47:14.767
BOY, YOU GOT A NICE,
HEALTHY HEAD OF HAIR THERE,

47:14.800 --> 47:16.233
YOU KNOW THAT ?
LOOK AT THAT.

47:16.267 --> 47:18.067
IT'S LIKE A PELT.

47:21.733 --> 47:27.133
UH, I DIDN'T REALLY GET
THE GOOD SHAVE TODAY, YOU KNOW.

47:27.167 --> 47:29.900
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
I'M AN EXCELLENT SHAVER.

47:29.933 --> 47:32.567
FEEL THIS CHEEK,
BLOOM, FEEL MY CHEEK.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.767
IT'S LIKE A TUSH,
IS THAT NOT A TUSH ?

47:35.800 --> 47:38.433
I GOT A TUSHY CHEEK.

47:38.467 --> 47:40.433
BOY OH BOY.

47:40.467 --> 47:47.133
PLEASE, MR. BIALYSTOCK, UM,
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT A MAN

47:47.167 --> 47:50.633
COULD MAKE MORE MONEY WITH
A FLOP THAN HE COULD WITH A HIT.

47:50.667 --> 47:54.500
DOES, DOES THAT BRING
ANY SCHEME TO MIND ?

47:57.667 --> 48:01.133
YEAH, YOU EVER
PLAY THIS GAME ?

48:01.167 --> 48:02.833
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

48:02.867 --> 48:04.867
YOU DON'T COME
TO THEATER WITH A HAT.

48:04.900 --> 48:05.867
IT'S NOT A HAT,
IT'S A TURBAN.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.533
YOU DON'T WEAR A HAT
TO THE THEATER.

48:07.567 --> 48:08.167
IT'S NOT A,
IT'S NOT A HAT.

48:08.200 --> 48:09.233
TAKE YOUR HAT OFF.

48:09.267 --> 48:10.233
I WON'T TAKE
MY TURBAN OFF.

48:10.267 --> 48:12.467
I CAN'T SEE
WHAT I'M SEEING.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.400
HE GAVE ME
THE TICKETS.

48:13.433 --> 48:15.067
ONLY TO CALM DOWN
AND TRY TO WATCH.

48:15.067 --> 48:17.767
NO, NO, FINE.

48:17.800 --> 48:18.867
I WATCH, YOU DON'T.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.933
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS MY COUSIN, ANDY.

48:21.967 --> 48:24.933
IT MAY COME AS NO SURPRISE
TO YOU TO LEARN THAT

48:24.967 --> 48:28.833
HE IS THE PRODUCT
OF INCEST.

48:28.867 --> 48:30.533
OF COURSE, AMONG
FRIENDS AND RELATIVES,

48:30.567 --> 48:33.067
ANDY IS KNOWN BY HIS
AFFECTIONATE NICKNAME,

48:33.100 --> 48:37.433
THE PRIMARY REASON
FOR ANTI-SEMITISM.

48:37.467 --> 48:40.367
UNFORTUNATELY, I KNOW
FROM EXPERIENCE

48:40.400 --> 48:42.567
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING
TO GET HIM TO CALM DOWN

48:42.600 --> 48:45.100
IS TO PUT A SWANSON
FROZEN DINNER ON HIS LAP.

48:45.133 --> 48:46.233
WAIT, LET'S GO BACK.

48:46.267 --> 48:47.833
YEAH, LET'S GO.
THIS IS FUNNY.

48:47.867 --> 48:51.267
I KNOW HE'S QUITE PARTIAL
TO THE SALISBURY STEAK.

48:51.300 --> 48:55.400
YOU KNOW, THERE MIGHT BE, UH, AN
UPSIDE TO THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE

48:55.433 --> 48:57.967
BECAUSE, UH, IF ANY OF YOU
ARE LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT

48:58.067 --> 49:00.967
IN NEW YORK, AND I KNOW
THEY ARE VERY HARD TO FIND,

49:01.067 --> 49:04.367
ANDY IS SUBLETTING
HIS MOUTH.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.467
THERE'S A LOT OF
ROOM IN THERE.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.867
A LOT OF ROOM.

49:08.900 --> 49:12.167
I KNOW THERE WAS A TALIBAN
LIVING IN THERE, UH,

49:12.200 --> 49:15.167
BUT HE LEFT AND, UH,
HE'S NOW RENTING SOME SPACE

49:15.200 --> 49:16.400
UNDER THE SIKH'S TURBAN.

49:19.767 --> 49:24.567
BUT THE TURBAN, IT HAS ALL KINDS
OF PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.

49:24.600 --> 49:30.433
IT'S A TOURNIQUET,
IT MAKES A LOVELY SASH,

49:30.467 --> 49:32.300
SAY YOU WANT TO HAVE
AN IMPROMPTU GAME OF

49:32.333 --> 49:34.533
PIN THE TAIL ON THE DONKEY,
YOU'VE GOT A BLINDFOLD.

49:38.333 --> 49:40.067
ALRIGHT,
WHAT WAS I SAYING ?

49:40.100 --> 49:41.633
WHAT WAS I SAYING ?

49:46.500 --> 49:47.500
WHAT WAS
I SAYING ?

49:50.733 --> 49:56.933
YOU WERE SAYING THAT
UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES,

49:56.967 --> 50:02.100
A PRODUCER COULD MAKE MORE WITH
A FLOP THAN HE COULD WITH A HIT.

50:02.133 --> 50:03.533
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE.

50:03.567 --> 50:08.200
YES, YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
BUT YOU DON'T SAY HOW.

50:08.233 --> 50:10.433
WELL, IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER
OF CREATIVE ACCOUNTING.

50:10.467 --> 50:13.300
LET'S ASSUME FOR A MOMENT
THAT YOU ARE A DISHONEST MAN.

50:13.333 --> 50:18.633
ASSUME AWAY.

50:18.667 --> 50:21.733
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON THEIR FACES,

50:21.767 --> 50:25.500
WHEN LARRY DAVID FORGET
EVERY LINE HE HAD ?

50:25.533 --> 50:27.233
HE WENT UP,
UP IN SMOKE.

50:27.267 --> 50:29.367
GOD, I'M SO GLAD,
I'M SO THANKFUL,

50:29.400 --> 50:32.433
THANK GOD THAT THIS DAMN PLAY
IS GOING TO BE OVER.

50:32.467 --> 50:33.633
WE'RE GONNA GET
OUR LIVES BACK.

50:33.667 --> 50:35.367
HE HAS FREED US
FROM THE ANCHOR,

50:35.400 --> 50:37.633
FROM THE ALBATROSS
OF THE PRODUCERS,

50:37.667 --> 50:39.800
WHICH HAS INVADED OUR LIVES
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE,

50:39.833 --> 50:41.467
EVERY HOUR
OF EVERY DAY.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.367
TRAPPING US...

50:42.400 --> 50:43.867
NO MORE OPENINGS
IN CLEVELAND.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.400
NO MORE SLEEPING
IN DIRTY BEDS IN PITTSBURGH.

50:46.433 --> 50:48.633
WE'RE FREE,
FREE AT LAST.

50:48.667 --> 50:50.367
I KNOW.
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL ?

50:50.400 --> 50:52.600
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT
HE COULD RUIN THE SHOW ?

50:52.633 --> 50:54.067
HOW ?

50:54.100 --> 50:56.900
THE MINUTE I LAID EYES ON HIM,
I SAID, THIS GUY'S A DISASTER.

50:56.933 --> 50:58.767
HE'S A LIVING DISASTER,
HE'S A STORM.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.967
HE'S LIKE A STORM THAT WILL
DESTROY EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

51:02.067 --> 51:04.167
I MEAN,
HE'S GOT THIS GIFT.

51:04.200 --> 51:06.067
EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES
HE DOOMS.

51:06.100 --> 51:08.833
HE'S A LITTLE CYCLONE,
A LITTLE TORNADO,

51:08.867 --> 51:10.533
DESTROYING
THE ST. JAMES THEATER.

51:10.567 --> 51:11.500
I KNOW.

51:11.533 --> 51:13.767
ANY MINUTE NOW,
THE SHOW WILL BE DEAD.

51:13.800 --> 51:17.967
HERE, A TOAST TO THE DEATH
OF THE PRODUCERS.

51:18.067 --> 51:20.267
MAY IT REST IN PEACE.

51:23.400 --> 51:27.267
INNKEEPER, INNKEEPER,
ANOTHER ROUND OF DRINKS HERE.

51:27.300 --> 51:28.733
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

51:28.767 --> 51:32.433
ANOTHER ROUND OF DRINKS
FOR EVERYBODY IN THE PLACE.

51:32.467 --> 51:35.167
HERE'S TO FAILURE.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.133
OH, THANK YOU.

51:37.167 --> 51:39.067
THAT'S VERY
KIND OF YOU.

51:39.100 --> 51:42.867
( laughing )

51:42.900 --> 51:44.333
PARTNERS, LEO.

51:44.367 --> 51:46.067
ALL THE WAY,

51:46.100 --> 51:49.067
AND NOTHING OR NO ONE
WILL EVER COME BETWEEN US.

51:49.067 --> 51:50.367
NOTHING OR
NO ONE, MAX.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.433
( knocking )

51:51.467 --> 51:55.133
( together )
COME IN.

51:55.167 --> 51:57.567
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.100
( foreign language )

51:59.133 --> 52:01.200
WHAT ?

52:01.233 --> 52:04.133
EXCUSE ME,
AYBANE SVENSKA--

52:04.167 --> 52:07.733
SWEDISH.

52:07.767 --> 52:10.533
CASTING... TODAY ?

52:10.567 --> 52:12.100
COSTING ?

52:12.133 --> 52:13.733

52:13.767 --> 52:17.067
OH, CASTING.

52:17.067 --> 52:19.833
UH, NO, I'M,
I'M SORRY, UH, MISS.

52:19.867 --> 52:21.067
THERE'S
NO CASTING TODAY.

52:21.067 --> 52:24.867
UH, ACTUALLY, THERE VERY
WELL COULD BE CASTING TODAY.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.067
COME IN,
COME IN.

52:29.600 --> 52:32.067
AAGH FUCK !

52:32.067 --> 52:35.433
* HONEYMOON,
HONEYMOON, HONEYMOON *

* BY THE SILVERY MOON

52:50.267 --> 52:54.133
( laughing )

52:58.367 --> 53:01.267
IT'S INTERMISSION,
QUICK, HIDE YOUR FACES.

53:01.300 --> 53:03.533
THEY'LL TEAR US
TO PIECES.

53:03.567 --> 53:08.067
( laughing )

53:08.100 --> 53:09.267
I'LL HAVE
A MANHATTAN.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.433
TWO WHISKEY SOURS.

53:10.467 --> 53:12.067
SO FAR THIS IS ABOUT
THE FUNNIEST THING

53:12.100 --> 53:13.333
I'VE SEEN ON BROADWAY.

53:13.367 --> 53:15.100
I'VE NEVER LAUGHED
SO HARD IN MY LIFE.

53:15.133 --> 53:16.667
ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL.

53:16.700 --> 53:20.900
I THOUGHT
I'D SPLIT MY SIDES.

53:20.933 --> 53:21.933
HONEY, DON'T PANIC.

53:21.967 --> 53:23.867
THERE ARE A LOT
OF SHOWS ON THIS STREET.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.900
THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY
BE TALKING ABOUT LARRY DAVID

53:25.933 --> 53:27.533
AND THE PRODUCERS.

53:27.567 --> 53:30.667
WHO WOULD HAVE
GUESSED LARRY DAVID
WOULD BE SO HYSTERICAL.

53:30.700 --> 53:31.767
LET'S GET BACK.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.200
IF HE'S AS BRILLIANT
IN THE SECOND ACT

53:33.233 --> 53:34.400
AS HE IS IN THE FIRST,

53:34.433 --> 53:37.067
THE SHOW'S GONNA RUN
FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS.

53:39.933 --> 53:41.267
GOT TO THINK.

53:41.300 --> 53:42.600
GOT TO THINK.

53:42.633 --> 53:44.733
NO WAY OUT.

53:44.767 --> 53:47.067
NO WAY OUT.

53:47.067 --> 53:49.133
NO WAY OUT.

53:49.167 --> 53:50.100
HONEY...

53:50.133 --> 53:51.733
NO WAY OUT.
LISTEN...

53:51.767 --> 53:53.767
NOW WAY OUT,
NO WAY OUT.

53:53.800 --> 53:56.367
THIS IS A SMALL
PORTION OF THE AUDIENCE.

53:56.400 --> 54:00.700
LET'S GO BACK AND SEE WHAT
THE MAJORITY HAS TO SAY.

54:00.733 --> 54:02.567
YES.MAJORITY?

54:02.600 --> 54:03.567

54:09.733 --> 54:15.667
( laughing )

54:15.700 --> 54:17.333
THIS IS
THE MAJORITY ?

54:17.367 --> 54:19.267
THIS IS
THE MAJORITY.

54:37.867 --> 54:40.900
* LEO AND MAX,
