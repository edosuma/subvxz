Italian, not French.

I could tell you more
if it was the latter.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.442
Why is that?

09:04.444 --> 09:07.178
Sadly, to understand the lineage

09:07.245 --> 09:09.114
of Italian wine, you have only

09:09.181 --> 09:12.083
your nose as a guide.
Now, the French,

09:12.085 --> 09:15.019
at least with regard
to the wines of Bordeaux,

09:15.087 --> 09:17.388
are much easier to identify.

09:32.404 --> 09:34.673
exactly where and when
the wine was bottled.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.708
Oh.
All I can tell

09:36.775 --> 09:38.710
from a bottle of Italian wine

09:38.712 --> 09:40.679
is that it is...

09:40.746 --> 09:43.281
well, Italian wine.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.484
Well, it must be special.

09:46.486 --> 09:50.054
If you say so.
Why do you say so?

09:50.056 --> 09:52.824
It was opened on the occasion

09:52.826 --> 09:55.159
of his only son's wedding.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.695
It may not be special.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.765
It may only have
sentimental value,

10:00.767 --> 10:05.637
which is worthless.
Also, Detective Murdoch,

10:05.704 --> 10:07.972
if this wine had been of note,

10:08.040 --> 10:10.308
he certainly would have
written about it.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.579
That Mr. Firenzo
wrote regularly

10:14.646 --> 10:16.481

10:16.483 --> 10:19.050
He was The Good Gentleman.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.386
Certainly you have heard of him.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.322
I'm afraid not.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.959
<i>The Vine</i> is a quarterly

10:28.026 --> 10:30.795

of fine wine.

10:30.863 --> 10:34.666
Mr. Firenzo, under the guise
of The Good Gentleman,

10:34.733 --> 10:36.968
would pen a column which was

10:37.035 --> 10:38.937
both entertaining and edifying.

10:39.004 --> 10:40.972
If this wine had been of note,

10:41.039 --> 10:43.341
he certainly would have
mentioned it.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.344
Hm.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.446
George, I need you

10:48.448 --> 10:50.014
to find out
where this came from.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.751
Oh, that should be
easy enough, sir.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.786
I think there are only three
wine merchants in the city.

10:54.853 --> 10:56.821
No, I mean the winery.

10:56.823 --> 11:00.091
This label is obviously a painting

11:00.158 --> 11:02.093
of what I believe to be a winery in Italy,

11:02.095 --> 11:04.095
but there is no other information,

11:04.097 --> 11:07.232
save for the name Angolino.
Get yourself to the library

11:07.299 --> 11:10.535
and see if you can find a winery
matching that name.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.170
Sir! Right away!

11:12.237 --> 11:14.372
George, I must say, you seem

11:14.439 --> 11:16.374
in rather high spirits lately.
I am.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.377
You think this is a democracy?
Now, don't say a word!

11:19.379 --> 11:21.979
In fact, one more word out of
the pair of you, I'll fire you

11:22.047 --> 11:24.382
quicker than Fred Spiksley
scored against the Wolves

11:24.450 --> 11:27.218

11:27.220 --> 11:29.187

The world is in her usual orbit.

11:33.158 --> 11:35.093
(sighing)

11:35.160 --> 11:38.096
Save for Constable Jackson.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.331
Well, I've been thinking
about that, sir, and...

11:40.398 --> 11:42.600
I think he died doing
something that he loved,

11:42.667 --> 11:45.103
serving a cause
that he believed in,

11:45.170 --> 11:47.105
a cause that you and I
continue to serve.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.441
I think he would have wanted that.
Indeed.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.677
I'll be in touch
upon my return from Italy.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.648

This is interesting.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.650
What's that?

Well, I would guess that any
well-bred and informed...

12:15.100 --> 12:18.436
I have many other interests
that don't include imbibing.

12:18.504 --> 12:21.573
Of course.
Now, who is

12:21.640 --> 12:23.741
this charlatan
that the good gentleman was

12:23.809 --> 12:25.710
preparing to unmask?

12:25.778 --> 12:28.446
A man by the name
of... Baron Trotter.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.616
Interesting.
Oh, he's not a real baron.

12:31.683 --> 12:34.452
No. Mr. Hatch,
the butler,

12:34.454 --> 12:37.555
said that a Mr. Trotter was
denied access to the wedding.

12:37.622 --> 12:40.124
Well, that makes sense,
especially if Mr. Firenzo had

12:40.192 --> 12:42.560
accused him of creating
illegitimate wine.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.796
Illegitimate?

12:44.863 --> 12:47.331
Counterfeit wine, Detective Murdoch,

12:47.399 --> 12:49.734
and according to Firenzo,
Mr. Trotter has been doing it

12:49.802 --> 12:51.836
for years.
Right here,

12:51.903 --> 12:54.005
in Ontario.
Oh.

12:54.072 --> 12:57.408
Wine is proof that God loves us

12:57.475 --> 13:00.478
and wants to see us happy.
I highly doubt that.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.947
Oh, you reject the words
of Benjamin Franklin?

13:02.949 --> 13:05.716
Even a clever man is
capable of a bad idea.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.719
No. Wine, like any alcohol,
is a depressant.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.721
It hinders the mind.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.991
But, "in wine there is truth."
Pliny the Elder.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.695
Writers and philosophers are
seldom the best of judges,

13:17.762 --> 13:20.298
especially when it comes to alcohol.

13:20.365 --> 13:22.667
Well, no one less
than Louis Pasteur called wine

13:22.734 --> 13:25.503
"the most healthful
and most hygienic of beverages."

13:25.505 --> 13:27.372
Is it that you don't
enjoy the taste?

13:27.439 --> 13:29.407
Ah.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.878
There he is.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.080
(birds chirping)

13:36.147 --> 13:38.783
Oh, I was aware of the article,

13:38.850 --> 13:40.785
everyone was,

13:40.787 --> 13:42.787
and it was going to ruin me.

13:42.854 --> 13:44.789
He was telling the truth?

13:44.856 --> 13:47.258
Of course not,
but once declared a fraud

13:47.325 --> 13:49.260
by The Good Gentleman,
I would've been powerless

13:49.262 --> 13:51.295
to fight the accusation.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.231
I'd already had a number
of orders cancelled.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.066
(horse whinnying)

13:55.133 --> 13:57.501
Being a Canadian winemaker is
not an easy business,

13:57.569 --> 14:01.072
and Mr. Firenzo is
intent on destroying me.

14:01.139 --> 14:03.241
I don't think you can

14:03.308 --> 14:05.276
speak of him
in the present tense any longer.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.145
Mr. Firenzo is dead.
Murdered,

14:08.213 --> 14:11.349
we believe.
He's dead?

14:11.416 --> 14:14.285
Yes.
Really? Dead?

14:16.622 --> 14:19.457
Oh, that is...
the most wonderful news.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.995
Oh, thank you!

14:26.999 --> 14:29.267
Will his article
still be coming out?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.102
(dramatic sound indication)

14:35.407 --> 14:38.109
I had noth

14:38.176 --> 14:39.977
Then why were you
at the Firenzo estate?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.846
Mr. Hatch,
the Firenzo's butler,

14:41.913 --> 14:44.715
told us he escorted you
off the property.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.318
He did no such thing.
I left of my own accord.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.021
Then why were you there?

14:50.088 --> 14:52.690
I was there to ask him

14:52.757 --> 14:54.659
to reconsider
publishing his column.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.194
Oh. So, you are not a fraud?

14:57.196 --> 15:00.298
I didn't say that.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.002
I can create a wine

15:05.004 --> 15:07.571
of as high a quality
as any European.

15:07.639 --> 15:09.807
And put it
in fraudulent bottles.

15:09.874 --> 15:12.143
No one would buy
a wine created in Ontario!

15:12.210 --> 15:15.046
I created a fine wine

15:15.113 --> 15:17.015
at a fraction of the cost.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.050
And do you charge

15:19.117 --> 15:21.052
a fraction of the price?

15:21.054 --> 15:24.422
I charged what the market would bear.

15:24.489 --> 15:26.390
But on my word,

15:26.458 --> 15:28.859
I did not kill the man.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.429
No matter how happy

15:31.496 --> 15:34.365
I might be that he's dead.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.901
Detective Watts,

15:36.968 --> 15:38.502
why wasn't I asked
to help with this?

15:38.570 --> 15:40.905
Oh, are you an aficionado
of the grape, Inspector?

15:40.907 --> 15:42.740
Well, I don't mind
the odd tipple if there's

15:42.807 --> 15:45.243
no scotch around. French.

15:45.310 --> 15:48.045
Produced right here in Ontario, I'm afraid.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.314
Mm! Some time ago, I'd wager.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.483
That's what we are about to find out.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.485
I'll keep hold of this.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.091
These labels are all new.

16:00.158 --> 16:02.360
They've simply
been bathed in tea

16:02.427 --> 16:04.729
to create the illusion of age.

16:04.796 --> 16:07.231
It's a common
forger's technique.

16:07.298 --> 16:10.201
Now, this label

16:10.268 --> 16:12.103
was aged by time alone.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.538
Also, unlike the labels

16:14.606 --> 16:16.540
from the bottles we obtained
from Mr. Trotter,

16:16.542 --> 16:20.978
this label was affixed with
an adhesive no longer in use.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.582
Current adhesives are
all rubber-based. This one...

16:26.618 --> 16:29.087
...is fish glue.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.622
So the wine is as old
as Mr. Firenzo said it was.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.991
So it would appear.
Well, then it follows

16:33.993 --> 16:36.027
that the arsenic was added
at the time of its bottling.

16:36.094 --> 16:40.431
Not necessarily.
♪

16:40.499 --> 16:43.100
This evening?
I most certainly can.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.569
Thank you!

16:45.571 --> 16:48.973
That was the hospital.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.242
They want to interview me
in person.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.644
Well, that is
the normal course of events.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.514
Of course.
I'm just so excited!

16:56.516 --> 16:58.949
Well, perhaps you should try not to be.

16:59.017 --> 17:01.585
Most patients don't want an excited doctor;

17:01.587 --> 17:04.521
they'd much prefer one
that's calm and professional.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.424
That is exactly what I will be.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.858
Calm and professional.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.929
(singing):
I'm gonna be a doctor!

17:11.996 --> 17:15.333
(both giggling)

17:15.400 --> 17:19.403
Now, it would be possible
to inject the arsenic

17:19.471 --> 17:21.338
through a new cork,

17:21.339 --> 17:23.339
but the old cork is

17:23.407 --> 17:25.309
completely dried out.

17:25.376 --> 17:28.813
It would have been very difficult.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.349
But not impossible.
No, although

17:32.417 --> 17:34.618
I believe your initial
assessment to be correct.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.488
The poison was
added prior to bottling.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.890
So... this was a lottery?

17:39.958 --> 17:42.426
Years ago, someone poisoned
a bottle of wine

17:42.494 --> 17:44.428
without ever knowing
who would purchase it,

17:44.496 --> 17:47.164
but knowing they had just given
someone a death sentence.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.034
An unsolvable crime.

17:50.102 --> 17:53.370
Well, no crime is unsolvable.

17:53.438 --> 17:56.173
Some simply take longer than others.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.709
(Watts sighing)
Though there is one thing

17:58.776 --> 18:01.378
that still confounds me.
And what's that?

18:01.446 --> 18:04.515
The idea that counterfeit wine
exists at all.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.084
After all, I doubt them to be

18:07.086 --> 18:09.086
that much different,
one from the other.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.122
They all use the same base ingredients.

18:11.189 --> 18:13.791
Oof. You can't be serious?

18:13.859 --> 18:16.594
I am.

18:16.661 --> 18:18.596
Wait right there.
I'm going to show you

18:18.663 --> 18:22.099
how wrong you are.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.135
(indistinct speaking)

18:27.672 --> 18:29.607
Well...

18:29.609 --> 18:32.210
this certainly is
a progressive hospital.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.411
That's one word for it.

18:34.479 --> 18:36.413
(scoffing)

18:36.415 --> 18:38.449
Thank you for your patience.

18:38.516 --> 18:40.618
I wonder if I could

18:40.620 --> 18:42.520
have a word with Miss...

18:42.587 --> 18:44.522
Rebecca James.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.457
Of course.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.527
Oh...

18:49.529 --> 18:52.463
I see.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.100
You see, that is a Right Bank Bordeaux.
Its component grape is

18:56.168 --> 18:58.636
the merlot, as opposed
to the Cabernet Sauvignon found

18:58.703 --> 19:00.804
on the Left Bank that you drank earlier.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.975
Do you notice the difference in sweetness?

19:04.042 --> 19:06.076
I think so,

19:06.144 --> 19:08.379
but can I try the Left Bank one again?

19:08.446 --> 19:11.882
Mm.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.886
♪

19:18.190 --> 19:20.891
Oh, yes. The difference
is apparent, yes.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.860
Now, this one is trickier.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.263
A pinot noir versus a merlot.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.943
Is that gooseberry?

19:39.010 --> 19:42.213
More like red cherry.
Oh.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.950
"Wine can of their wits the wise beguile,

19:46.017 --> 19:47.952
"the sage frolic

19:47.954 --> 19:50.254
and the serious smile."

19:50.321 --> 19:52.022
Oh!

19:52.024 --> 19:54.024
I can see it is doing just that.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.027
Oh, my.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.309
There we go.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.480
(furniture rattling)

20:16.547 --> 20:18.482
Shh!

20:18.549 --> 20:22.486
♪

20:26.825 --> 20:28.659
Julia!

20:28.661 --> 20:31.295
William.
You're still awake.

20:31.297 --> 20:34.031
That's nice.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.966
What are you reading?

20:36.034 --> 20:39.270
Oh, it's a new journal
about kinesiology.

20:39.337 --> 20:41.339
Fascinating.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.408
Where have you been?

20:44.410 --> 20:47.177
At work.

20:47.245 --> 20:50.214
William... have you
been drinking?

20:50.216 --> 20:52.783
I've been conducting

20:52.850 --> 20:55.820
a number of scientific
experiments on alcohol.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.855
And these experiments

20:57.922 --> 21:00.257
involved consuming the liquid?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.760
The results could
only be judged orally.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.429
Julia, do you know

21:05.496 --> 21:08.666
that there are several
different varieties of wine?

21:08.733 --> 21:11.035
Each with its
own characteristics!

21:11.102 --> 21:13.037
I did.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.972
But it's not just

21:15.039 --> 21:16.940
red and white.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.943
Although all wine is
made from the grape,

21:19.945 --> 21:23.113
some retains notes of tobacco

21:23.181 --> 21:26.717
and prunes and mushrooms!

21:26.719 --> 21:28.719
Mushrooms, if you could believe that!

21:28.721 --> 21:31.422
Julia, do we

21:31.489 --> 21:33.424
have any here?

21:33.491 --> 21:36.160
Oh, ah...

21:36.227 --> 21:38.396
I think you may have
had enough for this evening.

21:38.463 --> 21:42.333
No, just a tipple.
I think it's time for bed.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.035
Bed! Oh, I very much

21:45.103 --> 21:47.137

William?

22:04.756 --> 22:07.792
(snoring)

22:10.662 --> 22:12.629
A drop of tomato juice,

22:12.697 --> 22:15.900
one egg...

22:15.967 --> 22:17.968
Ah. Maybe two eggs.

22:18.035 --> 22:19.970
(phone ringing)

22:20.037 --> 22:22.339
A splash of hot sauce.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.608
Well stirred...

22:27.379 --> 22:29.580
...and Bob's your uncle.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.516
Right, then.
Get that down you

22:32.583 --> 22:34.785
and you'll be as right as rain
within half an hour.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.821
Trust me. I've been there.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.830
(sighing)

22:47.899 --> 22:50.234
So, did last night's investigations produce

22:50.301 --> 22:52.502
anything other than a throbbing headache?

22:55.573 --> 22:57.508
No.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.610
Ah, I mean yes.

22:59.677 --> 23:01.545
Ahh.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.514
We determined
that the wine was poisoned

23:03.516 --> 23:05.416
before it was bottled,

23:05.483 --> 23:07.317
but we may have been wrong.

23:07.385 --> 23:10.554
Could someone remove the cork

23:10.622 --> 23:13.524
and replace it
without damaging it?

23:13.591 --> 23:16.527
Corkscrew leaves a hole.
Yes, it does.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.897
But when I got on the trolley,
or maybe it was...

23:19.899 --> 23:21.799
Doesn't matter.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.168
I started thinking.
Of course you did.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.638
What if someone were
able to remove

23:27.705 --> 23:29.807
and replace the cork
without damaging it?

23:29.809 --> 23:32.643
Could there be a device
that would enable you

23:32.710 --> 23:34.545
to do such a thing?

23:34.612 --> 23:36.580
Of course there is.

23:36.648 --> 23:39.917
Have a look.
(exhaling slowly)

23:39.919 --> 23:41.786
(chuckling)

23:43.721 --> 23:45.689
Two prongs...

23:47.792 --> 23:50.360
...slide down either side

23:50.428 --> 23:53.898
of the cork...

23:58.903 --> 24:01.371
...enabling someone
to remove the cork

24:01.439 --> 24:03.373
without damaging it.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.542
Ah, so--
The same device could

24:05.544 --> 24:07.878
then be used to replace
the cork, leaving little

24:07.880 --> 24:09.813
or no trace at all.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.682
So, the arsenic was

24:11.749 --> 24:15.219
recently added to the wine.
Sirs. What's this?

24:15.221 --> 24:17.221
Another of
Murdoch's inventions.

24:17.288 --> 24:19.690
I just came up with it.
I've seen something

24:19.757 --> 24:22.693
just like it.
What? Where?

24:22.760 --> 24:25.762
Mr. Hatch, the butler.
I saw him using one.

24:25.830 --> 24:28.765
A new invention, eh?

24:28.833 --> 24:31.135
Looks like someone beat you
to it, me ol' mucker.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.774
You told us you kept
this place under lock and key.

24:36.841 --> 24:38.876
We can see very well
what you are doing.

24:38.943 --> 24:40.911
What do you want?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.914
We'd like you to accompany us
to the station house.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.383
We have some things we'd like to discuss.

24:46.450 --> 24:48.385
What things?

24:48.452 --> 24:51.622
We believe you to have
been in possession

24:51.689 --> 24:54.591
of a device crucial in
the poisoning of your employer.

24:54.593 --> 24:57.695
He was more than an employer.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.598
He was a lifelong friend.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.567
Well, that may be, Mr. Hatch,

25:03.634 --> 25:05.569
but we still have questions.

25:07.405 --> 25:10.474
What are you doing with him?

25:10.541 --> 25:13.544
Make way, Mr. Firenzo.
He did it?

25:13.611 --> 25:16.647
He killed my father?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.816
After all he did for you?
This is how

25:18.883 --> 25:22.085
you repay him?
That's enough, Mr. Firenzo.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.088
(dramatic music)

25:31.495 --> 25:34.831
Yes. Yes, it's mine.

25:34.899 --> 25:37.501
That concerns us,
Mr. Hatch.

25:37.568 --> 25:39.503
As does the fact
that we found you

25:39.570 --> 25:42.239
in the selfsame cellar
you claim never to set foot in.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.608
I know how it looks.

25:44.675 --> 25:46.610
I sneak down there

25:46.677 --> 25:48.579
and pop some poison
into that bottle, yes?

25:48.646 --> 25:51.181
That is how it looks.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.350
The thing is, I didn't.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.986
Then why do you own
one of these devices?

25:56.054 --> 25:59.356
To steal wine.
That's why the thing's invented.

25:59.423 --> 26:01.325
You expect us to believe that?

26:01.392 --> 26:03.660
In the words of Diogenes,

26:03.662 --> 26:07.364
"What I like to drink most is
wine that belongs to others."

26:11.168 --> 26:13.103
Ahem. How long have you

26:13.170 --> 26:15.072
been stealing
Mr. Firenzo's wine?

26:15.139 --> 26:17.774
Since the beginning.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.344
The man was kind to me

26:20.411 --> 26:22.245
but he paid me a pittance.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.314
So, I...

26:24.382 --> 26:26.984
helped myself
to the occasional mouthful.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.621
And, what? Replaced it with some malmsey?
Surely he would notice.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.724
Firenzo thought himself an expert

26:33.791 --> 26:36.493
but his palette was hardly without flaw.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.029
One time, he said

26:39.031 --> 26:42.099
an 1870 Lafite had notes of saffron.

26:42.166 --> 26:43.901
Hah!

26:48.139 --> 26:50.040
So, you lied to the police.

26:50.042 --> 26:53.043
A man has been murdered and you lied to us.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.379
It was only a little lie.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.148
I didn't want
to tell you I'd been, uh...

26:58.216 --> 27:00.350
naughty.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.819
So, you know
Firenzo's cellar.

27:02.887 --> 27:05.589
What can you tell us
about this bottle?

27:05.591 --> 27:07.491
Yes, I recognize it.

27:07.558 --> 27:09.526
He'd had it for some time.

27:09.593 --> 27:11.528
How long?
I don't know precisely.

27:11.595 --> 27:14.998
You see, the current house
is only 40 years old.

27:15.066 --> 27:17.868
Before that,
Mr. Firenzo's cellar was

27:17.935 --> 27:21.071
only a few crates stacked up
on a dirt floor.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.006
But it's at least 40 years old.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.008
Yes. It was there
from the beginning.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.277
You know, I'd, ah...

27:27.279 --> 27:30.681
I'd considered tasting it
myself many times,

27:30.683 --> 27:32.883
but I could never
discern its provenance.

27:32.950 --> 27:35.352
Imagine if I had!

27:37.355 --> 27:39.390
(laughing)

27:42.594 --> 27:44.895
(rapid footsteps)

27:44.962 --> 27:47.564
Professor Ferguson said
he told them about me.

27:47.631 --> 27:49.566
Well, you should've
seen the man's face

27:49.633 --> 27:51.568
when he saw what colour I was.

27:51.635 --> 27:54.404
Rebecca, I'm so sorry.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.373
The man had the gall
to tell me that my presence

27:56.441 --> 27:58.375
might upset the other patients.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.777
What was his name?

28:00.845 --> 28:02.779
I know people at Queen of Mercy,
I'll talk to someone.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.781
You know that won't
change a thing.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.084
The doctors there are
more likely to share his view

28:07.151 --> 28:09.319
than yours.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.789
You can stay here.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.524
I'll bring you on full time.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.626
I suppose our patients
won't mind my presence.

28:16.694 --> 28:19.096
But no.

28:19.163 --> 28:21.264
Thank you all the same,
Dr. Ogden.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.500
It's important work
we do here, Rebecca.

28:23.567 --> 28:25.569
Even though our patients may be dead,

28:25.636 --> 28:28.272
our work saves lives.

28:28.339 --> 28:30.407
I know...

28:30.474 --> 28:32.676
but it's my dream to work
with people face to face;

28:32.678 --> 28:35.412
to help ordinary people,
people who need me,

28:35.480 --> 28:37.381
people I'll know
for the rest of our lives.

28:39.317 --> 28:42.753
(footsteps)

28:42.755 --> 28:45.322
Once more, the inebriated mind
proves its worth.

28:45.389 --> 28:49.392
"Wine makes a man
mistake words for thoughts."

28:49.460 --> 28:51.862
Who said that?
Samuel Johnson.

28:51.929 --> 28:53.831
Johnson, really?

28:53.898 --> 28:55.632
I swear Boswell labelled him a drinker.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.268
Perhaps he was
more of an ale man.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.637
At any rate, we are no further
ahead than we were last night.

29:00.704 --> 29:02.639
Now, hold on, Murdoch.
Just because that butler says

29:02.706 --> 29:04.575
he didn't do it,
doesn't mean he didn't do it.

29:04.642 --> 29:06.577
Yes, but we have no proof.

29:06.644 --> 29:08.812
At least the butler confirmed
the age of the bottle.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.680
But we still don't
know its provenance,

29:10.748 --> 29:14.050
nor can we say with any certainty
when it was poisoned.

29:14.118 --> 29:16.987
Sirs, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

29:17.054 --> 29:20.123
but I'm not convinced this wine
is what it pretends to be.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.058
Why do you say that, George?

29:22.060 --> 29:24.060
Sir, I've been through
the catalogue of every

29:24.128 --> 29:27.063
wine enthusiast in this city.
I've examined thousands of bottles of wine.

29:27.131 --> 29:30.066
I've read through lists of hundreds
of wineries. I've even telegraphed

29:30.134 --> 29:32.202
with experts in Italy.
Alright, Crabtree.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.772
No need to relive
every heart-stopping moment.

29:34.839 --> 29:37.707
Sir, my point is
as far as I can tell,

29:37.775 --> 29:40.778
Angolino wine doesn't exist.

29:40.845 --> 29:44.548
So, it's a fake.
I believe so.

29:44.615 --> 29:47.651
A new wine masquerading
in an old bottle

29:47.718 --> 29:49.620
makes sense
for the murder, but--

29:49.687 --> 29:52.088
But the butler claimed
that it's been in his cellar

29:52.090 --> 29:54.124
at least 40 years.
Could he be lying?

29:54.191 --> 29:56.226
I don't see what he could
stand to gain from it.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.862
He's lied to us before.
Perhaps he's hiding something.

29:58.929 --> 30:01.364
I have an idea.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.567
I believe there is a way

30:03.634 --> 30:06.169
to determine the age
of the liquid inside the bottle.

30:06.237 --> 30:09.206
I had the identical thought,

30:09.273 --> 30:10.240
Detective, and I know
just the man.

30:10.307 --> 30:12.042
Man?

30:12.109 --> 30:14.377
Someone who can
unlock the truths that lurk

30:14.379 --> 30:16.613
in the depths of the bottle.
I don't believe that will

30:16.680 --> 30:19.282
be necessary,
nor will it be reliable.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.585
I intend to prove it scientifically.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.520
What?

30:23.588 --> 30:25.389
How?

30:25.456 --> 30:28.792
Spectroscopic analysis.
Ah, yes.

30:28.859 --> 30:30.794
Not reliable in my experience.

30:30.861 --> 30:32.729
How's it meant to help us?

30:32.731 --> 30:34.898
By comparing
the wine in question

30:34.965 --> 30:38.235
to the light profile
of other wines of varying ages,

30:38.302 --> 30:41.471
we'll be able to discern
precisely how old it is.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.808
The older the wine, presumably
the lighter the colour,

30:44.876 --> 30:47.110
thanks to the blanching
effect of sunlight.

30:47.177 --> 30:49.279
But it was kept in a cellar.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.548
Depending on conditions,
two bottles of the same

30:51.615 --> 30:53.550
provenance could be wildly different.

30:53.618 --> 30:56.019
There's absolutely no way to determine--

30:56.021 --> 30:58.021
Thank you, Detective.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.723
Please.
Alright.

30:59.725 --> 31:02.659
Ready?
Yes.

31:02.726 --> 31:05.762
(fast-paced piano music)

31:05.830 --> 31:08.098
It's a four point three.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.306
It's a five point two.

31:19.677 --> 31:22.479
Eight point five.

31:24.648 --> 31:26.450
Well...

31:28.519 --> 31:30.453
...they are all different.

31:30.521 --> 31:33.790
Really...
Every grape,

31:33.857 --> 31:37.327
every year, every bottle.
You don't say.

31:37.394 --> 31:40.130
It compares to an 1880 merlot,

31:40.197 --> 31:43.133
a 1902 tempranillo and...

31:43.200 --> 31:45.302
several others.
Well!

31:45.304 --> 31:48.471
I suppose you told us so,
Detective.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.740
Alright.

31:50.808 --> 31:53.076
Call in your expert.

31:53.144 --> 31:55.012
Ah, not my expert.

31:57.015 --> 32:00.383
My sommelier.

32:00.385 --> 32:02.218
"Sommelier"!

32:02.286 --> 32:05.322
<i>Detective,</i>

32:05.324 --> 32:08.325
May I introduce Jean Michel LaRoche Couture III.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.829
<i>Le vin, s'il vous plaît.</i>
<i>Mon temps est précieux.</i>

32:12.896 --> 32:15.231
<i>Ainsi que le mien,</i>
<i>Monsieur Couture.</i>

32:15.299 --> 32:17.067
Ne le gaspillons pas.

32:17.134 --> 32:19.503
I see you know the language,
but not the wine.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.871
How do we know you'll be able

32:21.873 --> 32:23.773
to determine the vintage?

32:23.841 --> 32:26.109
Were you the same
at 13 as you were at 30?

32:26.177 --> 32:28.645
Just as a man changes over time,

32:28.712 --> 32:31.247
so too does a wine.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.350
And you can see these changes
at a mere glance?

32:33.352 --> 32:36.052
Well, this eye has decades
of training, Detective.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.121
This is the finest eye
in North America;

32:38.123 --> 32:40.157
one of the finest in the world.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.861
This is the wine in question.

32:44.928 --> 32:46.896
Oh, my.

32:46.964 --> 32:49.866
It's quite old.

32:49.933 --> 32:52.669
45 years if it's a day.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.704
45?

32:54.772 --> 32:56.673
So 1860 then?

32:56.741 --> 32:58.842
If only an eye test could
establish provenance.

32:58.909 --> 33:01.077
That's not a problem.
I can tell you what it is

33:01.145 --> 33:03.546
from a small taste.
No. No. No.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.548
This wine has been
laced with arsenic.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.351
Oh, my. That will
make it difficult.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.921
Some of the subtleties
may be overshadowed

33:10.988 --> 33:13.123
by the adulterant.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.529
This is a fox grape.

33:19.596 --> 33:21.564
Catawba, I would venture,

33:21.632 --> 33:24.768
but as I say, the subtleties
may be obscured.

33:24.835 --> 33:27.303
So where is Catawba grown?

33:27.371 --> 33:29.572
Catawba is from right here.

33:29.574 --> 33:32.576
This wine is not from Italy,
it's from Ontario.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.745
(dramatic music)

33:41.418 --> 33:44.521
There are over 35 wineries

33:44.523 --> 33:46.389
but only one of them goes
back as far as 1860.

33:46.391 --> 33:49.125
Barker Family Wines and Spirits.

33:49.127 --> 33:52.195
"Barker Wine."
Lacks a certain <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

33:52.263 --> 33:54.998
Does Barker use fox grapes?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.867
Well, sir, as I understand it,
nearly all indigenous grapes

33:57.935 --> 34:00.537
are fox grapes, but the variety
in question, Catawba,

34:00.604 --> 34:02.939
only grow
in certain soil conditions,

34:03.006 --> 34:05.542
such as the area
around the Firenzo estate.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.977
So the vintner
could be local, then.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.946
Well, that makes sense.
A neighbour, a friend.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.014
Someone he knew who had intended

34:12.016 --> 34:13.983
to kill him back in 1860.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.686
Except none of
the Catawba-growing wineries

34:16.688 --> 34:19.188
go back that far.
Well, perhaps it's one

34:19.255 --> 34:21.257
that existed then
but doesn't now.

34:21.259 --> 34:24.761
I'll go to City Records
and get any files that
might be of interest.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.996
But we can comb through them
back here, Constable.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.732
No. Let's meet halfway.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.168
Café Lorraine. This is work
to be done over a glass

34:32.235 --> 34:34.471
of fine red. Ah...

34:34.538 --> 34:38.041
I'd invite you to join us,
Detective, but...

34:38.108 --> 34:41.511
well, perhaps it's best
you stay on the watercart.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.452
I love you
for not giving up, Rebecca.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.286
But?

34:51.355 --> 34:53.255
I'm just wonderin'
how long you're plannin'

I know you will!

But even Rebecca James can't
change the world overnight.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.966
Well, I don't care
how long it takes!

35:03.033 --> 35:05.535
I'll be a doctor
even if I have to wait

35:05.537 --> 35:07.671
for the whole world
to catch up.

35:07.738 --> 35:10.140
Alright then.
In the meantime,

35:10.142 --> 35:13.610
I'll stay on at the morgue.
No, you won't.

35:13.612 --> 35:17.114

I want you spending

Now, what we really need is
for all them white doctors

35:22.986 --> 35:25.755

just for one day.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.824

see them the rest of their lives.

Oh, come on, girl.

Sorry, sir. I'm not drunk.

Oh, really?
We had a few.

35:50.514 --> 35:52.949
Just speak for yourself.
I had half a glass.

35:53.016 --> 35:55.585
Well, two half a glasses.

35:55.652 --> 35:59.122
May I ask exactly what it is

35:59.189 --> 36:00.924
Look here.

36:02.859 --> 36:04.861
Business license application
for a winery.

36:04.863 --> 36:08.331
Filed in 1859.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.433
All the details line up, sir.
It's the right region

36:10.435 --> 36:13.002
for Catawba.
Who is the owner?

36:13.070 --> 36:15.371
Unfortunately,
the form is incomplete.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.174
It's blank.
Yeah.

36:17.241 --> 36:19.209
There's one intriguing detail,
though, sir. Have a look

36:19.276 --> 36:21.578
at where the address is.
Avalon Road.

36:21.645 --> 36:23.313
Where is that?

36:23.380 --> 36:25.215
Steady, Crabtree!

The Avalon Road,
sir, is now known

36:29.886 --> 36:33.289

and it intersects
with this laneway.

36:33.291 --> 36:36.960
On which sits
the Firenzo estate.

36:37.027 --> 36:38.995

right around the corner.

Oy, Crabtree!

We're off to catch the culprit.
