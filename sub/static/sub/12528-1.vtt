13:11.041 --> 13:12.209
<i>He came highly recommended.</i>

13:12.242 --> 13:14.111
Makes musical steampunk
instruments.

13:14.144 --> 13:15.480
You know, balalaikas,
accordions.

13:15.513 --> 13:17.482
Where's my coffee?

13:17.515 --> 13:19.716
Some neo-Victorian shit.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.486
What?

13:21.519 --> 13:24.255
And most importantly, he's
a potential client's son,

13:24.289 --> 13:25.790
so don't be gross.

13:25.823 --> 13:27.125
<i>I'm sorry.
Don't be late.</i>

13:27.158 --> 13:28.760
Well, I don't even know
what he looks like.

13:28.793 --> 13:30.028
<i>I showed him
your book jacket photo,</i>

13:30.061 --> 13:31.829
<i>so try and resemble it.</i>

13:35.967 --> 13:38.369
Thank you so much.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

13:41.339 --> 13:44.275
And so after working
in soul-killing jobs,

13:44.309 --> 13:47.947
I decided to just chuck it all
and do something practical.

13:47.980 --> 13:51.951
Hmm. Like designing
steampunk instruments?

13:51.984 --> 13:54.421
I love creating something
with my own hands, you know?

13:54.454 --> 13:56.121
Like, when you make
something,

13:56.155 --> 13:58.991
you put it out there
in the world... [sighs]

13:59.024 --> 14:02.795
There's this feeling that you
actually, I don't know...

14:02.828 --> 14:04.196
Matter?

14:06.265 --> 14:07.866
Yeah.

14:09.068 --> 14:10.269
Yeah.

14:12.105 --> 14:15.842
- So Kelly tells me you're a writer.
- Yeah.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.278
It's actually been
kind of crazy.

14:18.311 --> 14:21.147
Right after college,
I started this blog, <i>Sara Syndrome.</i>

14:21.181 --> 14:23.451
And it was sort of like
a satiric look

14:23.484 --> 14:27.320
at feminism and sexuality
in the age of social media.

14:27.354 --> 14:31.425
And now I write
these softcore romance novels

14:31.459 --> 14:34.861
for dumb millennials.
Like, blergh!

14:34.894 --> 14:36.998
- Now I'm working on my third.
- Oh, wow.

14:37.031 --> 14:38.533
Like a series or something?

14:38.567 --> 14:40.234
Would I know it?
What's it called?

14:40.268 --> 14:43.438
The debut is called <i>Sext.</i>

14:43.472 --> 14:45.507
But it came out
when the word was new,

14:45.540 --> 14:49.143
- so it was cool at the time.
- Got it.

14:49.176 --> 14:51.580
Actually, the whole thing
was written entirely in emojis.

14:51.613 --> 14:53.314
I can't tell
if you're kidding.

14:53.347 --> 14:55.216
Guess you'll have
to read it to find out.

14:55.249 --> 14:57.952
- [chuckles]
- The critics were okay with it,

14:57.985 --> 15:00.188
but almost everyone
hated the ending.

15:00.222 --> 15:01.323
Why? What happens?

15:01.356 --> 15:03.593
Well, the protagonist,
Sara,

15:03.626 --> 15:07.262
she flies into this passionate
fit of jealous rage

15:07.296 --> 15:12.334
and castrates her boyfriend,
Ben, with a paring knife.

15:12.367 --> 15:15.237
Yeah! [laughs]
Gotcha!

15:17.005 --> 15:19.475
Oh, I'm kidding.
[laughs]

15:19.509 --> 15:20.909
That was a joke.

15:20.942 --> 15:24.047
[laughs] Whew.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.617
Obviously, they're not called Ben and
Sara, that would be crazy.

15:26.650 --> 15:30.119
But she does
castrate him at the end.

15:30.153 --> 15:33.189
I guess I'll just have
to read the next one.

15:33.222 --> 15:34.391
What is
the next one called?

15:34.425 --> 15:36.025
<i>Chastity.</i>

15:36.059 --> 15:38.161
Times have changed, huh?

15:38.194 --> 15:40.263
No, but seriously,
and don't tell Kelly this,

15:40.296 --> 15:45.436
but I haven't actually written a
single word in like two months.

15:45.469 --> 15:47.439
Am I too young
to be washed up?

15:49.674 --> 15:51.409
Well, maybe you're
abstaining from writing

15:51.443 --> 15:53.110
to learn about abstinence.

15:54.278 --> 15:57.047
Yeah. Maybe I am doing that.

That's right.

Well, you got a smile

Hell, I know so.

So, we friends again?

You got retty good for someone who
doesn't perform there, young lady.

01:26:49.611 --> 01:26:51.913
- Maybe we should make a duo.
- [Sara giggles]

01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:55.517
Yeah, like Faith Hill
and Tim McGraw.

01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:56.886
You could be Faith.

01:26:56.919 --> 01:26:58.319
So if we're going

And I know I haven't met
the real you yet...

I'm the one that's the phony.

I'm sorry I wasn't honest
with you about the book,

01:27:38.662 --> 01:27:41.965
but I learned so much about
you and myself writing it.

01:27:41.998 --> 01:27:43.567

If you don't show them
the real you...

01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:03.988
they're going to cut
you from the program.

01:28:07.793 --> 01:28:09.527

together.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.763
They have counselors there
to help you through this,

01:28:11.797 --> 01:28:13.665
and I could help you.

01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:17.102
You just have
to be yourself.
