-[Jackie] Hey! Somebody!
-[Max] Hey! Let us out! Please!

00:12.920 --> 00:18.400
-Please! Please, let us out! Help!
-Help!

00:20.280 --> 00:22.320
[crowd cheering]

00:33.520 --> 00:35.520
[line ringing]

00:41.520 --> 00:44.200
Find your open man!
Find your open man!

00:48.800 --> 00:51.320
[whoops and exclaims]

00:53.080 --> 00:55.840
-What are you doing?
-He was wide open!

00:55.920 --> 00:59.200
What was Louis thinking accepting
this Alex into the Eagles?

00:59.280 --> 01:00.680
Yeah, he is such a loser.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.680
Yo, keep doing that.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.200
[rock sliding]

01:26.200 --> 01:30.160
Where is Judy? Don't tell me
she's still at that stupid game.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.360
She'll be here any minute.
The H-hour is set to the game's end.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.840
[Kyle] Amateurs.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.760
[typing]

01:48.720 --> 01:51.560
I have to check the servers. I'm sorry.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.360
[exhales heavily]

01:55.200 --> 01:56.920
[whispers] What are you doing here?
You can't be here.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
[whispers] Where's my mom?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.160
[Marcus] Get in.

02:04.560 --> 02:09.600
Well, don't just stand there!
Don't you have preparations to do?

02:10.320 --> 02:13.840
Uh, we should probably go over
the initiation protocol.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.240
[gasps]

02:23.920 --> 02:25.040
[Ryan] Hayley?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.600
[inhales sharply] Mom.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.560
[theme music playing]

03:06.720 --> 03:08.360
[sobs] Mom...

03:09.600 --> 03:11.400
I've missed you so much.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.720
How did I get here?

03:18.680 --> 03:19.840
Mom.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.840
[sighs] Marcus brought you here.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.320
Your spacecraft exploded.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.560
How?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.720
How long since...

03:34.800 --> 03:36.880
[inhales sharply] Almost a year.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.440
A year?

03:43.920 --> 03:46.160
I've been here the whole time?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.880
I think so.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.160
[chuckles softly]

03:53.120 --> 03:54.960
Look at you.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.400
My sweet girl.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.880
[chuckles]

04:01.800 --> 04:03.320
How's Alex?

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
He's okay.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.720
Mom, we both just found out
that you're alive.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.840
No one knew that you were here.
Not even Dad.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.680
I don't understand.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.120
Why didn't Marcus tell him?

04:21.279 --> 04:24.600
He couldn't.
He was trying to protect you.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.640
He told me to use the escape pod.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.520
How did he know?

04:35.640 --> 04:37.200
Because he's working with them.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.480
What is going on?

04:45.640 --> 04:46.600
Who are you?

04:47.680 --> 04:51.040
I am Ryan Woods.
Who the hell are you?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.000
[cell phone vibrates]

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
What the...

05:14.280 --> 05:16.440
-[line ringing]
-[Eric] I would advise you against that.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.120
What's up, buddy?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.280
Hey, guys.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.640
What's going on?

05:30.720 --> 05:32.640
[chuckles] Would you get a load of this...

05:32.720 --> 05:34.360
[both grunting]

05:38.080 --> 05:39.320
Good job, Perry.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.480
[chuckles] How stupid is this guy?

05:44.360 --> 05:45.800
Cracks me up.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.720
[crowd cheering]

05:48.720 --> 05:51.760
Be aggressive!
Do not let them get to the rim!

05:51.840 --> 05:52.840
Come on!

05:57.240 --> 06:00.080
No! What is the matter with you?

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
Keep it.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.600
[Daniel] Parker!

06:07.440 --> 06:10.280
Ah! What? Come on. Time out.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.960
Dude, calm down. Just settle, okay?
Finish this. Yes.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.040
[sniffles]

06:16.120 --> 06:18.600
What are you doing, Hayward?
Are you trying to kill me?

06:18.680 --> 06:19.800
I can't watch this.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.640
He's probably just exhausted.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.840
Yeah, well, exhaustion
is no excuse for stupid mistakes.

06:24.920 --> 06:28.320
Whoa, Mom. You can't go now.
You're my good-luck charm.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.760
[sighs]

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
-Okay.
-[sighs] Yes!

06:46.400 --> 06:50.120
It's no use, Jackie.
What were we thinking?

06:50.200 --> 06:52.960
[sighs] These are professionals
we're dealing with.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.520
Help!

06:54.600 --> 06:56.320
We really thought we could outsmart them.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.560
Max, snap out of it!
Get up and stop whining!

07:01.560 --> 07:05.240
-Please! Someone! Anyone, help!
-Help!

07:05.960 --> 07:07.960
Let us out, please!

07:08.040 --> 07:09.080
[Aspen] Hello?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.200
See? Hello?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.440
[Max] Open the door, please!
Can you hear us?

07:14.520 --> 07:17.400
Help, please! Let us out!

07:17.480 --> 07:20.600
Please! Can you hear us? Please!

07:24.240 --> 07:27.440
-Marcus...
-[Kyle] You knew about it, didn't you?

07:28.760 --> 07:31.560
Be very thankful that
you're useful to me right now.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.200
How fast can you initiate?

07:33.280 --> 07:36.120
-You don't have do this, Marcus.
-What is going on, Hayley?

07:36.200 --> 07:38.960
-They're planning another earthquake.
-Answer my question.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.080
-They can't do this without you.
-That is enough out of you.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.360
If you want these two to live,
I suggest you get on with your work.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.360
[inhales deeply]

07:57.880 --> 07:59.320
[Jackie] Who's out there?

07:59.920 --> 08:00.760
[Aspen] It's me!

08:00.840 --> 08:02.880
-Aspen?
-[Aspen] What are you doing in there?

08:02.960 --> 08:07.040
The door's locked.
Can you let us out? Please?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.200
[pounding on door]

08:12.080 --> 08:14.320
[Max] Aspen? Are you there?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.400
Max, this is the girl
who would've let Hayley drown.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.240
She probably ran off.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.440
You're right, we are doomed.

08:25.800 --> 08:26.640
[thudding]

08:26.720 --> 08:28.840
[Aspen] I'm here with Leo.
We're getting you out of there!

08:28.920 --> 08:31.320
[grunts] Hang in there, guys.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.840
Isolation, weak side!

08:39.919 --> 08:41.159
One, one, one!

08:47.320 --> 08:48.800
[whistle blowing]

08:52.960 --> 08:54.600
[referee] Two shots. Two shots.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.600
Oh, just put one in
and end this nightmare, will you?

08:59.680 --> 09:00.880
[Louie chimes]

09:00.960 --> 09:03.320
[Leo through Louie]  Your brother
locked Max and Jackie in the lab.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.280
We're trying to get them out
but we need more time.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.840
[both grunting]

09:06.920 --> 09:08.120
We're gonna get you out of there.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.520
Alex! Hey.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.240
[whispering] We need more time, okay?

09:16.320 --> 09:19.440
-They need more time.
-[sighs] I hate doing this to Parker.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.120
[exhales heavily]

09:25.760 --> 09:26.840
[Alex] Let's go, D.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.640
[crowd chanting] Daniel! Daniel!

09:28.720 --> 09:31.120
[coach] Come on, Daniel. Come on!

09:31.200 --> 09:33.160
[crowd clapping rhythmically]

09:35.960 --> 09:37.760
[crowd groaning]

09:42.160 --> 09:46.200
It's all right, it's all right.
Focus, bro.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.040
Come on! [grunting]

09:52.840 --> 09:54.720
[both grunting]

10:07.320 --> 10:09.400
[dialing] Where is that stupid Jason?

10:09.480 --> 10:11.160
[line ringing]

10:19.360 --> 10:21.640
[crowd groaning]

10:21.720 --> 10:22.960
[coach] Oh, come on!

10:26.680 --> 10:29.320
-[buzzer sounds]
-[man over PA] We're in overtime!

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
[sighs]

10:32.400 --> 10:34.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We got 'em in OT. We got 'em in OT.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.640
[cell phone rings]

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
Bathroom break.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.640
-Jason! Stop!
-Now is really not a good time, Brooke.

10:51.720 --> 10:55.320
I know where you're going.
I know everything.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.880
[both grunting]

11:03.800 --> 11:06.200
-Thank God!
-Are you okay?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.760
Hey, we owe you big time.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.160
That's okay.
You don't owe me anything.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.680
I better run upstairs
to bring the servers back on.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.680
[Aspen exhales sharply]

11:14.760 --> 11:18.680
Thank you, Aspen.
I'm really glad you're on our side.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.680
I know about you and Emma,

11:22.760 --> 11:24.920
how you made her
hack into the NASA server.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
Why aren't you with Judy?
She needs you.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.800
Sorry to break it to you,
but I'm no longer under her spell.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.480
-I gotta go.
-You don't!

11:44.080 --> 11:46.960
Like Dad said,
Judy is a hard woman to say no to.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.320
But there's still time
for you to do what's right.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.000
Go back to the game, Brooke.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.840
[door opens]

12:14.920 --> 12:16.880
[gasps]

12:34.520 --> 12:35.520
Here.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.880
What's this?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.000
Emma's new number.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.240
Go back to your laptop.
I'll turn the servers back on.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.520
Initiate the countdown.

13:01.200 --> 13:06.040
-But Judy's--
-Now. Don't test me. Do it.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.480
-[electricity hums]
-[gasps]

13:18.760 --> 13:20.760
[sighs] There we go.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.720
I want you to have
the best seat in the house.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.320
'Cause the last thing you're gonna see
before this house blows up

13:26.400 --> 13:29.160
is a little earthquake
we've managed to arrange.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.920
It's all my fault.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.320
I discovered the linkage between
this magnetite and seismic activity.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.320
-My goal was to prevent earthquakes.
-And they found a way to reverse it.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.920
[Eric] If only you'd opened
your wife's letter before I burnt it,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.400
you would've known all about
her classified earthquake research.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.040
[chuckles] How did she put it? Um, ah...

13:52.120 --> 13:54.960
[imitating Ryan] "In the last few years,
I've kept a secret from you."

13:55.040 --> 13:57.680
-[muffled grunt]
-She was on to us, you idiot,

13:57.760 --> 14:00.080
and you didn't even bother to read it.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.360
So, our lesson for today, my friend, is

14:02.440 --> 14:07.600
if your wife leaves you a letter
before she dies, open it.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.320
[Eric and Perry chuckling]

14:09.400 --> 14:11.120
[muffled grunting]

14:11.840 --> 14:16.040
-[grunting continues]
-[Eric through cell phone]  What? What?

14:17.240 --> 14:19.600
[Emma over speakers]
I miss you guys so much.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.200
I know, Emma,
but we're running out of time.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.760
Right, right, okay. Um, I set up
a crypto bypass in the system

14:25.840 --> 14:28.320
so you can circumvent
the encryption process. Can you see it?

14:29.400 --> 14:32.160
-Yes, I see it.
-How will this stop the bad guys?

14:32.240 --> 14:33.800
[Ryan] Once the satellite is online,

14:33.880 --> 14:36.960
it will detect the magnetite
and interfere with its magnetism.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.320
That should automatically
shut down their system.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.640
[cell phone ringing]

14:43.080 --> 14:45.040
We have less than a minute left, boss.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.080
It's set to 8.4 on the Richter scale.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.080
Hello.
I need to speak with Brandon Thomas.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.800
This is Leo Cruz from the Greenhouse.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.760
Yeah, tell him his satellite's
about to come back to life.

14:58.840 --> 14:59.880
[Max] What's taking so long?

14:59.960 --> 15:00.960
[Emma]  Must be a delay

15:01.040 --> 15:02.920
because we're interfering
with their VPN network.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.080
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.000
[Emma]  Max, it may not work at all,
you know.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.560
[grunting]

15:15.920 --> 15:17.160
[Kyle] Hold him!

15:17.240 --> 15:19.360
-[grunts]
-Marcus, no!

15:21.080 --> 15:22.080
Marcus!

15:23.640 --> 15:26.200
-[Eric] All right, we gotta go.
-[Perry] Right.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.720
[beeping]

15:34.520 --> 15:37.080
-[police sirens wailing]
-[tires screeching]

15:37.160 --> 15:38.160
[officer 1] Hands up!

15:38.240 --> 15:39.400
[officer 2] Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

15:39.480 --> 15:41.440
-What's going on, guys? Get your--
-Hey, whoa...

15:41.520 --> 15:44.320
[officer 1] Check the house
for explosives. Calm down.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.160
Eric.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.840
[computer chimes]

15:50.920 --> 15:53.200
-[Max sighs]
-What just happened?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.800
-This kid just saved California.
-[chuckles]

15:57.080 --> 15:58.280
[automated voice]
Auto shut down activated.

15:58.360 --> 16:01.400
What's going on? No.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.720
-[Hayley] What happened?
-[Ryan] The satellite must be back online.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.080
-They did it!
-No!

16:09.280 --> 16:10.800
Brooke, we did it.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.240
-Max and Emma did their thing.
-[Max chuckles]

16:12.320 --> 16:13.720
You'll never guess
how we got Emma's number.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.280
You're kidding. Jason gave it to you?

16:16.360 --> 16:19.080
[coach] All right, keep your heads up.
Keep your heads up!

16:19.160 --> 16:22.320
Come on, move it up,
move it up! You can do it!

16:24.160 --> 16:25.560
-They did it.
-Seriously?

16:27.920 --> 16:32.240
[coach] Okay, okay!
Move it up, move it up! Come on!

16:34.520 --> 16:36.400
Hey! They did it!

16:36.480 --> 16:38.440
[sighs] Oh, yes! Set me a screen
and I'll do the rest.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.080
I got you, I got you.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.840
Find him, find him!

16:57.320 --> 16:59.480
-[buzzer sounds]
-[all cheer]

17:06.520 --> 17:08.520
[crowd chanting] Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

17:13.200 --> 17:15.079
-Judy?
-Hmm?

17:15.160 --> 17:18.200
Oh, uh, will you give Daniel
all my love? I really have to go.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.280
Really? I'm afraid you're not updated.

17:21.359 --> 17:22.359
What are you talking about?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.280
That nice little earthquake
you were planning?

17:25.359 --> 17:30.640
It's not happening. Sorry.
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.680
[all cheering]

17:38.920 --> 17:41.800
It's all over.
The police are gonna be here any minute.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.360
You're about to see your mom.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.800
-Whoo!
-Daniel!

17:51.560 --> 17:52.600
[mouthing] Come over here.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.640
[crowd continues chanting]
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

18:00.760 --> 18:04.040
-What do you want?
-We have to go. Right now.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.840
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Especially not with you.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.600
Hey! I need you to show me
some respect, Daniel.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.080
Respect? Respect for what?

18:14.160 --> 18:17.360
I know what you did to Brooke.
I know all about your plan.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.520
You know nothing.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600
And it's my fault,

18:20.680 --> 18:23.160
because I've been hiding
too many things from you.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.400
What things?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.840
I'm an agent.
I work for the government.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.760
[sighs] Really? Since when?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.440
Since before you were born.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.560
This... This "plan"
you've been talking about

18:36.640 --> 18:39.360
is actually
a highly classified secret operation.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.640
I can't believe you're still lying to me.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.600
A secret operation?

18:46.680 --> 18:52.160
Yeah, right. Initiating an earthquake?
How many people would have died in it?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.560
Believe me, I... I did it for you.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.320
Don't bring me into this.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.920
Okay, listen, Daniel, let's just go
and I'll explain it to you after we leave.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.600
Daniel! Please, just stop.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.400
You're right, I've lied to you.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.240
[stutters] I've made a lot of
bad decisions because...

19:24.640 --> 19:26.120
It doesn't matter why.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.800
But if I don't leave right now,

19:28.880 --> 19:30.640
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life in prison.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.520
Is that really what you want?

19:33.680 --> 19:35.440
Baby, I'm begging you.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.360
You're the only person
I have in this world.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.360
Just... Just come with me.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.320
You wanna run away?

19:49.240 --> 19:52.200
Do it. I'm staying here.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.480
Daniel. Daniel!

20:02.360 --> 20:04.720
-He saved us.
-[Ryan] I know.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.360
What are they doing?

20:10.560 --> 20:12.640
-[beeping]
-What are you smiling about?

20:12.720 --> 20:15.040
You're gonna rot in jail
for the rest of your life.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.280
Oh, no. I don't think so.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.560
See, I just wired
a time bomb to the magnetite.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.480
The explosion will
destroy the entire Greenhouse,

20:25.560 --> 20:27.520
and by the time they'll clear the debris,

20:28.120 --> 20:30.680
I'll be, oh, so far away from here.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.080
So, enjoy your reunion.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.160
[timer beeping]

20:36.240 --> 20:39.800
You've got about two and a half
minutes to catch up.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.640
[beeping continues]
