Come on!

04:04.670 --> 04:06.713
Come on. Keep moving.

04:37.286 --> 04:39.329
Come on.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.304
Keep looking.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.975
Stay down.

05:04.646 --> 05:07.065
Attaboy. Attaboy, sniff it out.

05:26.043 --> 05:28.420
Pick it up, boy. Pick it up.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.974
Come on. Come on.

05:49.566 --> 05:50.734
Lennie.

05:59.034 --> 06:01.078
Get down.

06:23.809 --> 06:25.852
Hurry up.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.564
Get up there.

07:05.809 --> 07:08.270
- George?
- What d'you want?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.939
Where are we going?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.108
To get away from here.

07:15.318 --> 07:17.612
I'm all wet.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.407
Come on, let's take off your coat.
Come on.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.952
Come on.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.957
Just lay down and get some rest.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.890
George?

07:46.016 --> 07:48.018
Go to sleep, Lennie.

07:48.143 --> 07:50.186
I'm sleeping, George.

08:24.346 --> 08:28.475
- George, where are we going?
- We're going to a ranch to work.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.981
Come on. You get off here.

09:18.399 --> 09:20.860
George, wake up.

09:21.069 --> 09:23.488
You're in Soledad.

09:23.613 --> 09:25.698
We're going to the Tyler ranch.

09:25.824 --> 09:29.035
You gotta get off here.
The ranch is down the road.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.705
- How far?
- Just down the road a stretch.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.711
- Where the hell is it?
- George?

09:38.837 --> 09:40.755
- Yeah?
- Where are we going?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.924
Jesus Christ, you're a crazy bastard.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.468
I forgot, George.
I tried not to, then I forgot.

09:45.593 --> 09:48.888
I spend all my time telling you things,
then you forget 'em.

09:49.013 --> 09:51.057
I remember about the rabbits.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.853
The hell with them rabbits.
That's all you can remember.

09:55.395 --> 09:59.440
Okay, listen. This time don't forget.
We went into Murray and Ready's.

09:59.566 --> 10:04.112
- They give us work cards and bus tickets.
- George, I remember that now.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.825
But George, I ain't got mine.
I must've lost it.

10:08.950 --> 10:12.704
I got both of 'em. You think I'd let you
carry your own work card?

10:12.829 --> 10:15.331
I thought I had it in my own pocket.

10:15.456 --> 10:17.750
What did you take out of that pocket?

10:19.294 --> 10:21.546
There's nothing in the pocket, George.

10:22.005 --> 10:26.175
I know it ain't. You got it in your hand.
Now, what you got in your hand?

10:26.301 --> 10:28.803
George, that's just my mouse.

10:28.928 --> 10:32.307
But I didn't kill it, George.
Honest, I found it dead.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.641
Oh, jeez.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.060
- Give it here.
- George, leave me have it.

10:36.185 --> 10:39.439
Give it here. What do you want
with a dead mouse anyway?

10:39.772 --> 10:43.484
I was just petting it with the fingers
while we was walking along.

10:43.693 --> 10:47.488
Yeah, well, you ain't petting no mice
when you walk with me.

10:47.614 --> 10:51.326
You gonna give me that mouse,
or am I gonna have to sock you?

10:52.452 --> 10:54.495
Come on.

11:11.512 --> 11:14.182
Blubbering like a baby,
a big guy like you!

11:17.685 --> 11:20.521
Lennie, I ain't taking it
away for meanness.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.360
That mouse ain't fresh, Lennie.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.328
Get another mouse that's fresh,
I'll let you keep him.

11:35.453 --> 11:39.248
I don't know where
there is no other mouse.

11:43.795 --> 11:49.425
The lady used to give me some,
but that lady ain't here no more.

11:49.550 --> 11:52.011
Lady?

11:52.136 --> 11:54.806
Don't you even remember who that lady was?

11:56.182 --> 11:59.018
That's your Aunt Clara.
She stopped giving 'em to you.

11:59.143 --> 12:02.438
You was always killing 'em
by petting 'em too hard.

12:06.484 --> 12:08.528
I'll tell you what I'll do.

12:09.570 --> 12:12.073
First chance I get, I'll get you a puppy.

12:14.325 --> 12:16.369
Huh? That'd be better than mice.

12:17.578 --> 12:19.622
You could pet 'em harder.

12:22.917 --> 12:24.961
Okay?

12:25.628 --> 12:26.963
Huh?

12:29.882 --> 12:31.592
Hey.

12:31.717 --> 12:33.928
Hey! Hey!

12:38.141 --> 12:39.767
Son of a bitch!

12:39.892 --> 12:41.936
What did you say, George?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.606
I said "son of a bitch".

12:46.899 --> 12:51.362
The bus driver lied to us. Just too
damn lazy to stop at the ranch gate.

12:52.905 --> 12:56.242
- Son of a bitch!
- Son of a bitch!

12:58.578 --> 13:00.955
Jesus Christ, George, I said it too.

13:01.789 --> 13:06.419
- Yeah, I heard you.
- George, we wasn't supposed to say that.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.504
Yeah, why not?

13:08.629 --> 13:10.965
Aunt Clara don't like it.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.134
Yeah, well, she's dead.

13:27.064 --> 13:29.108
Lennie.

13:29.817 --> 13:31.903
Don't drink so much.

13:33.571 --> 13:35.698
Hey.

13:35.823 --> 13:39.994
That's good, George. You have a drink.
You have a good, big drink.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.640
It's nice here.

14:00.765 --> 14:04.810
I think we'll just spend the night
and go to the ranch tomorrow.

14:06.896 --> 14:09.607
Ain't we gonna get no supper?

14:09.732 --> 14:13.778
Yeah, sure we are.
I got three cans of beans in my bindle.

14:16.572 --> 14:18.616
I like beans with ketchup.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.038
I like beans with ketchup.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.207
We ain't got any.

14:27.708 --> 14:30.628
Go on. Go get some wood
so we can build a fire.

14:35.299 --> 14:39.595
- We got enough beans here for four men.
- I like 'em with ketchup.

14:41.138 --> 14:43.182
We ain't got any.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.854
Goddamnit!

14:54.485 --> 14:57.822
Whatever we ain't got,
that's what you want.

15:00.783 --> 15:02.368
George?

15:03.035 --> 15:04.704
George?

15:06.455 --> 15:09.542
- What d'you want?
- George, I was only fooling.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.378
I don't... I don't want no ketchup.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.923
If it was here, you could have some.

15:16.674 --> 15:19.593
George, I wouldn't eat no ketchup.

15:19.718 --> 15:24.765
I'd leave it all for you
and you could cover your beans with it.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.934
I wouldn't touch none of it.

15:27.309 --> 15:32.022
When I think of the swell time
I could have without you, phew, I go nuts.

15:32.857 --> 15:34.900
I never get any peace.

15:38.279 --> 15:40.489
If I was alone, I could live so easy.

15:42.616 --> 15:45.327
I could get a job and work and no trouble.

15:47.455 --> 15:50.708
And when the end of the month come,
I could take my 50 bucks,

15:50.833 --> 15:54.295
I could go into town,
I could get whatever I want.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.714
I could stay in a cathouse all night.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.303
What do I got?

16:02.428 --> 16:04.096
I got you.

16:04.221 --> 16:07.600
You can't keep a job.
Lose me every job I get.

16:08.893 --> 16:12.438
Keep me shovin' all over
the country, all the time.

16:13.898 --> 16:15.941
That ain't the worst.

16:16.233 --> 16:20.779
You get in trouble. You do bad things
and I got to get you out all the time!

16:22.573 --> 16:26.160
Crazy son of a bitch, you keep me
in hot water all the time.

16:33.584 --> 16:38.130
George, you... you want I should
go away and leave you alone?

16:40.633 --> 16:42.676
Where the hell would you go?

16:49.475 --> 16:51.518
I could go...

16:53.395 --> 16:56.482
I could go off in them hills there
and find a cave.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.610
Yeah? How'd you eat?

17:02.154 --> 17:04.698
You ain't got sense enough
to find nothin' to eat.

17:04.823 --> 17:09.536
I find things. I don't need
this nice food with ketchup.

17:11.413 --> 17:15.501
George, if you don't want me,
I go off in them hills and get a cave.

17:17.877 --> 17:20.839
And I wouldn't get no mice
stole off me either.

17:28.597 --> 17:33.519
Jesus Christ, your Aunt Clara wouldn't
like you running off by yourself.

17:37.773 --> 17:39.817
Hey!

17:41.568 --> 17:45.239
Well, go get some wood
so we can build a fire afore it gets dark.

18:03.674 --> 18:05.217
- George?
- What?

18:05.342 --> 18:07.636
Tell me like you done before.

18:08.137 --> 18:10.764
- Tell you what?
- About the...

18:12.599 --> 18:14.435
- About the rabbits.
- Not tonight.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.689
Come on, George. Tell like you done
before. Please? Please? Please?

18:18.814 --> 18:21.108
You get a kick out of that, don't you?

18:23.110 --> 18:25.070
Okay.

18:25.195 --> 18:27.239
I will.

18:28.782 --> 18:34.163
Guys like us that work on ranches
are the loneliest guys in the world.

18:36.081 --> 18:39.543
They ain't go no family
and they don't belong no place.

18:41.211 --> 18:45.549
- They got nothin' to look ahead to.
- But not us, George. Tell about us now.

18:45.674 --> 18:48.010
Well, we ain't like that. We got a future.

18:48.135 --> 18:51.930
We got somebody to talk to
that gives a damn about us.

18:52.055 --> 18:55.851
If them other guys gets in jail,
they can rot for all anybody cares.

18:55.976 --> 18:57.895
But not us, George, because I...

18:58.020 --> 19:02.399
See, I got you to look after me,
but you got me to look after.

19:02.524 --> 19:04.985
But, George, tell about how it's gonna be.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.236
Okay.

19:06.361 --> 19:08.405
Someday...

19:09.406 --> 19:13.076
we're gonna have us
a little house and a couple of acres,

19:14.661 --> 19:17.789
- and a cow and a pig and chickens.
- Pig and chic...

19:17.915 --> 19:20.876
We gonna live off the fat of the land,
and have rabbits.

19:21.001 --> 19:22.586
And have rabbits.

19:22.711 --> 19:25.881
- George, tell what we got in the garden.
- Okay.

19:26.006 --> 19:32.054
Then tell about the rabbits in winter,
and about the stove and, uh...

19:34.765 --> 19:38.185
- how thick the cream was on the milk.
- Yeah.

19:39.561 --> 19:42.564
- Go ahead, tell it.
- Why don't you do it? You know all of it.

19:42.689 --> 19:46.443
George, no! George, no,
it's not the same when I tell it.

19:46.568 --> 19:48.320
That's not the same.

19:48.445 --> 19:52.824
Tell, um, what...
how I get to tend the rabbits.

19:54.326 --> 19:59.248
We're gonna have a big vegetable patch
and we're gonna have a rabbit hutch.

19:59.373 --> 20:03.919
- And down in the flat, we'll have a...
- ...little field of alfalfa for the rabbits.

20:04.044 --> 20:07.965
- And I get to tend the rabbits.
- Yeah, you get to tend the rabbits.

20:08.090 --> 20:10.133
When it rains in the winter,

20:12.177 --> 20:14.680
we'll just say
"The hell with going to work,"

20:14.805 --> 20:18.934
and we'll just build a fire in the stove,
and we'll just sit there

20:19.059 --> 20:21.103
and we'll listen to the rain.

20:44.793 --> 20:47.254
Lennie, I want you to look around here.

20:48.839 --> 20:52.300
If you get in any trouble,
I want you to come right here.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.680
- You hide over here in the brush.
- Hide in the brush.

20:56.805 --> 21:01.518
You hide in the brush until I come
for you. Can you remember that?

21:01.643 --> 21:04.938
Sure I can, George.
Hide in the brush till you come for me.

21:05.063 --> 21:08.525
If you do get in trouble,
I ain't gonna let you tend the rabbits.

21:08.650 --> 21:12.154
I'm not gonna get into any trouble.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.282
Okay.

21:17.075 --> 21:19.453
I can remember, by God.

21:20.203 --> 21:22.497
Let's get some rest.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.882
It'll be nice sleeping here,

21:33.550 --> 21:35.886
just looking up at the leaves.

21:49.858 --> 21:51.067
George?

21:55.071 --> 21:56.907
What do you want?

21:57.824 --> 22:02.454
I... I think we should get
them different color rabbits.

22:03.747 --> 22:05.790
Sure.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.586
Red rabbits and blue rabbits
and green rabbits.

22:42.827 --> 22:46.581
- Leave 'em alone.
- Be quiet, dogs. Be quiet, goddamnit.

22:47.874 --> 22:50.043
Be quiet!

22:50.335 --> 22:53.672
Shut up, Smiley! Shut up. Smiley, down.

22:56.675 --> 23:00.136
- You fellas looking for something?
- Yeah. We come here to work.

23:00.262 --> 23:03.139
- Where's the boss?
- He's up at the ranch house.

23:03.265 --> 23:06.101
I'm Candy. Come on,
I'll take you up there.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.561
He was expecting you last night.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.856
He was sore as hell that
you wasn't here to go out this morning.

23:11.982 --> 23:14.025
He come in when we was having breakfast.

23:14.150 --> 23:16.820
He said "Goddamnit,
where the hell is them new men?"

23:16.945 --> 23:20.907
And he gives the stable buck hell too.
You see, the stable buck's a nigger.

23:21.032 --> 23:24.494
Ah! There he goes.

23:24.619 --> 23:27.956
He got a crooked back
where a horse kicked him one day.

23:28.081 --> 23:31.167
The boss gives him hell
every time he gets mad.

23:31.293 --> 23:33.837
But the stable buck...

23:33.962 --> 23:37.173
The stable buck
don't give a damn about that.

23:37.299 --> 23:39.384
Boss's office in here.

23:48.143 --> 23:49.853
Come in.

23:53.773 --> 23:55.817
These guys just came.

24:14.377 --> 24:18.715
I wrote Murray and Ready...
for two men to work this morning.

24:20.091 --> 24:22.469
Where's your work slips?

24:26.347 --> 24:28.391
Is my slip in there?

24:31.144 --> 24:33.188
It wasn't Murray and Ready's fault.

24:33.313 --> 24:37.192
Says right here you were supposed
to be ready to work this morning.

24:37.317 --> 24:40.320
Bus driver lied to us.
We had to walk ten miles.

24:41.738 --> 24:44.365
I don't give a damn about that.

24:44.491 --> 24:47.660
- What's your name?
- George Milton.

24:47.911 --> 24:50.205
- What's yours?
- His name's Lennie Small.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.541
- Where you boys been working?
- Up around Weed.

24:53.708 --> 24:55.752
- What about you?
- Yeah, him too.

24:58.463 --> 25:00.423
He's not much of a talker, is he?

25:01.841 --> 25:07.305
No, no, he ain't. But he's a hell
of a good worker. He's strong as a bull.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.474
Strong as a bull?

25:14.270 --> 25:17.690
Uh, he can do anything
you tell him. He's a...

25:19.484 --> 25:23.905
He's a good skinner. He can wrestle
grain bags, drive a cultivator.

25:24.030 --> 25:26.824
Cultivator. Ah, but...

25:27.617 --> 25:29.702
I ain't sayin' he's bright - he ain't.

25:29.827 --> 25:34.374
But he's a... he's a damn good worker.

25:36.084 --> 25:39.337
Say... what you selling?

25:41.381 --> 25:43.424
What's your stake in this guy?

25:45.051 --> 25:47.095
Are you taking his pay from him?

25:48.304 --> 25:50.348
Hell, no.

25:52.475 --> 25:58.356
He's my cousin.
I told his old lady I'd take care of him.

25:58.481 --> 26:01.693
He got kicked in the head
by a horse when he was a kid.

26:05.488 --> 26:06.656
All right.

26:08.741 --> 26:11.953
But you'd better not try
to put anything over on me.

26:14.831 --> 26:17.417
Now catch your grain teams after dinner.

26:20.044 --> 26:23.506
Well, I wasn't kicked in the head
with no horse, George.

26:23.631 --> 26:27.302
Be a damn good thing if you was.
Save everybody a hell of a lot of trouble.

26:27.427 --> 26:29.804
You... you said I was your cousin.

26:29.929 --> 26:34.183
Well, that was a lie. If I was
a relative of yours, I'd shoot myself.

26:38.354 --> 26:41.190
Come on, I'll show you the bunkhouse.

26:42.650 --> 26:44.694
Come on. Come on, boy.

26:45.945 --> 26:49.657
Come on, come on.
You can take these two bunks right here.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.298
That's a hell of an old dog.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.800
Yeah.

27:07.925 --> 27:11.929
And he's getting older too.
I had him since he was a pup.

27:12.930 --> 27:16.142
God, he was a great sheepdog
when he was younger.

27:22.857 --> 27:25.818
Hey... what the hell is this?

27:26.360 --> 27:31.407
Says "Positively kills lice,
roaches and other scourges".

27:31.532 --> 27:34.035
What the hell kind of beds
are you giving us?

27:34.327 --> 27:37.497
Now, wait a minute there, young fella.
Wait a minute.

27:37.622 --> 27:39.999
Let me see what you're talking about.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.669
Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember.

27:43.795 --> 27:46.214
Last guy that had this bunk
was a blacksmith.

27:46.339 --> 27:49.425
He'd squirt this stuff around
even if there was no bugs.

27:49.550 --> 27:54.055
He used to... he used to wash
his hands even after he ate.

27:55.765 --> 27:58.392
Candy!

27:58.518 --> 28:02.605
- You seen my old man?
- Yeah, he's up at the house.

28:09.070 --> 28:12.740
- You the guys the old man's waiting for?
- Yeah, we just came in.

28:12.865 --> 28:16.619
- Let the big guy talk.
- Suppose he don't wanna talk?

28:16.744 --> 28:19.163
What the hell you gettin' into this for?

28:19.288 --> 28:21.624
We travel together.

28:21.749 --> 28:26.254
- Oh. Oh. So it's that way.
- Yeah, it's that way.

28:26.379 --> 28:29.215
And you won't let
the big guy talk, is that it?

28:34.011 --> 28:36.055
We just come in.

28:46.899 --> 28:50.444
Yeah, well, next time
you answer when you're spoken to.

29:04.792 --> 29:07.545
Say, what the hell?
Lennie didn't do nothing to him.

29:08.838 --> 29:13.217
That's the boss's son.
Curley's pretty handy with his fists.

29:13.342 --> 29:17.013
- Done a lot of fighting in the ring.
- What's he got against Lennie?

29:17.179 --> 29:19.223
Well, I'll tell you what.

29:20.683 --> 29:23.352
Curley's like a lot of little guys.

29:23.477 --> 29:27.523
Hates big guys. Kinda like
he's mad at 'em cos he ain't a big guy.

29:27.648 --> 29:31.527
Yeah, yeah. Well, he better
make no mistake about Lennie.

29:31.652 --> 29:36.657
Lennie ain't handy. This Curley's gonna
get hurt if he messes around with Lennie.

29:36.782 --> 29:38.159
Yeah, well.

29:38.284 --> 29:41.078
Hey, come here. I wanna show
you something. Come on.

29:41.912 --> 29:45.624
Come on, boy. Come here, come here.
I wanna show you something.

29:47.501 --> 29:50.379
- You see that glove on his left hand?
- Yeah.

29:50.504 --> 29:53.632
- Well, that glove's full of Vaseline.
- What the hell for?

29:53.758 --> 29:57.136
Curley says he's keeping
that hand soft for his wife.

29:58.262 --> 30:00.973
That's a real nice thing to tell around.

30:01.098 --> 30:03.142
Come on, boy. Come on.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.604
Lennie.

30:07.021 --> 30:09.982
- Look. See that guy?
- Yeah.

30:10.107 --> 30:12.610
- The one that was just in here?
- Yeah.

30:12.735 --> 30:17.073
He figures he got you scared. He's gonna
take a sock at you first chance he gets.

30:17.198 --> 30:20.951
George, I don't want no trouble.
Don't let him sock at me.

30:21.077 --> 30:23.204
Just try to keep away from him, will ya?

30:23.329 --> 30:26.874
If he comes in the bunkhouse again,
move to the other side of the room.

30:26.999 --> 30:30.753
George... George,
you ain't mad at me, are you?

30:32.546 --> 30:38.010
No, I ain't mad. Just try to keep away
from Curley. Don't let him pull you in.

30:38.135 --> 30:40.846
Sure. George, I wasn't gonna say a word.

30:41.388 --> 30:44.683
You get in any trouble,
you remember what I told you.

30:44.809 --> 30:48.229
If I get in any trouble,
I don't get to tend them rabbits.

30:49.396 --> 30:51.357
No, that's not what I mean.

30:51.482 --> 30:55.194
Remember where we slept
last night, down by the river?

30:59.323 --> 31:01.992
I'm looking for Curley.

31:02.118 --> 31:05.162
He was here a minute ago, but he went.

31:06.372 --> 31:08.415
Oh.

31:15.589 --> 31:17.633
Sometimes Curley's in here.

31:19.301 --> 31:21.345
He ain't now.

31:22.721 --> 31:26.642
Well, if he ain't,
I guess I better look someplace else.

31:27.601 --> 31:30.563
If I see him, I'll tell him
you was lookin' for him.

31:33.315 --> 31:35.901
Nobody can't blame a person for looking.

31:41.991 --> 31:44.034
See ya around.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.792
- She's pretty.
- Lennie...

31:52.001 --> 31:56.547
- Don't you think she's pretty?
- Listen to me, goddamnit!

31:56.672 --> 31:58.716
- Don't you even look at her.
- But...

31:58.841 --> 32:01.802
I don't care what she says
or does, she's a rat-trap.

32:01.927 --> 32:04.388
But I wasn't doing nothing.

32:04.513 --> 32:09.810
When she was shoving her legs around,
you weren't looking the other way neither.

32:09.935 --> 32:12.104
Keep away from her.

32:26.201 --> 32:28.245
I don't like this place.

33:00.069 --> 33:02.571
- You the new guys?
- Yeah.

33:02.696 --> 33:05.366
I'm Slim. You're gonna be on my team.

33:05.491 --> 33:08.410
I'm George Milton.
This here's Lennie Small.

33:09.828 --> 33:12.915
- You travel around together?
- Yeah.

33:13.040 --> 33:17.419
There ain't many guys travel
around together. I don't know why.

33:17.544 --> 33:20.964
Maybe everybody in the whole damn
world's scared of each other.

33:21.090 --> 33:22.841
Maybe.

33:22.966 --> 33:25.427
So, you ever bucked barley before?

33:25.552 --> 33:31.517
Hell, yes. I ain't nothin' to scream about,
but... Lennie's strong as a bull.

33:31.642 --> 33:33.394
Good.

33:33.519 --> 33:38.315
I got a pair of punks on my team, they
don't know a barley bag from a blue ball.

33:43.445 --> 33:46.115
These guys just came.

33:46.240 --> 33:50.035
I meant to ask you, Slim.
How many puppies your bitch have?

33:50.160 --> 33:53.455
Well, she slung eight of 'em.
I drowned four right off.

33:54.832 --> 33:57.884
She couldn't feed that many.
I just kept the biggest.

33:59.378 --> 34:02.965
Candy's dog is old and no good.

34:03.090 --> 34:08.053
You oughta get Candy to shoot that dog.
Then you could give him one of the pups.

34:11.931 --> 34:12.933
All right.

34:14.184 --> 34:17.146
George, ask that man,
can I have one of his pups?

34:17.271 --> 34:19.313
Yeah, I will. Don't worry.

34:23.277 --> 34:25.320
Come on, get up.

36:25.399 --> 36:27.692
You done real good today, Lennie.

36:27.818 --> 36:29.861
You done real good.

36:34.116 --> 36:36.159
Okay, I'll ask him now.

36:37.869 --> 36:39.913
- Slim.
- Yeah?

36:57.639 --> 36:59.683
George, can I have this white one?

37:02.018 --> 37:04.062
Well, if that's the one you want.

37:06.523 --> 37:08.859
Can he stay here and hold it awhile?

37:08.984 --> 37:11.027
Sure.

37:20.579 --> 37:24.457
Lennie, you can't take
that pup out of here.

37:26.042 --> 37:30.046
- It's too young to leave the mother.
- I ain't going to, George.

37:39.639 --> 37:41.808
Come on.

37:41.933 --> 37:44.436
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

37:56.156 --> 37:58.617
That's it, take it easy.

38:13.423 --> 38:17.427
- You talking today?
- Nah, he ain't. He's too busy working.

38:17.552 --> 38:19.804
- Is he a good worker?
- Best I ever had.

38:19.930 --> 38:22.557
- What about his partner?
- What about him?

38:22.682 --> 38:25.435
Is he a good worker?
My old man wants to know.

38:26.436 --> 38:29.272
Yeah, he's a good worker.

38:32.442 --> 38:34.486
Ha! Giddap.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.921
Come on, Violet. Come on, girl.

38:53.588 --> 38:57.801
George, this mule has a sore foot.
Lead her back to the stable

38:57.926 --> 39:01.096
- and ask Crooks to give you another one.
- Sure.

39:01.221 --> 39:03.723
- Go on, girl.
- Come on, girl. Come on.

39:03.848 --> 39:05.892
Go on, now.

39:07.102 --> 39:08.311
Jake!

39:09.229 --> 39:11.356
Come on, girl. Come on.

39:12.482 --> 39:14.526
Attagirl. Come on.

39:18.446 --> 39:20.490
Come on, now. Come on.

39:30.291 --> 39:33.294
Come on. Come on!

39:36.464 --> 39:38.508
Crooks!

39:41.886 --> 39:44.055
Can I help?

39:46.307 --> 39:48.351
No.

39:49.686 --> 39:53.106
I'm looking for Crooks.
This mule's got a hurt foot.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.276
He ain't here.

39:56.401 --> 39:58.820
Nobody's here but me.

39:58.945 --> 40:01.489
And now you.

40:07.287 --> 40:09.873
I feel so lazy today.

40:09.998 --> 40:12.375
You feel lazy?

40:13.751 --> 40:16.045
No.

40:21.926 --> 40:24.179
I could take a nap right here.

40:24.304 --> 40:27.223
It's nice and cool here in the barn,
and quiet.

40:27.348 --> 40:30.560
Everybody out in the fields
working in the hot sun.

40:31.936 --> 40:33.938
Here we are in a cool barn.

40:38.026 --> 40:41.029
I got a hurt foot too.

40:41.154 --> 40:46.242
I got mad at Curley last night, kicked at
him and missed - kicked a chair instead.

40:52.290 --> 40:54.334
Let go of that old mule and talk to me.

41:04.594 --> 41:06.638
Are you from far away?

41:08.640 --> 41:10.683
Pretty far.

41:13.228 --> 41:15.271
How far is far away?

41:17.982 --> 41:20.109
What's the town you came from?

41:21.110 --> 41:23.154
You wouldn't know it if I told you.

41:26.324 --> 41:28.368
You got a sweetheart back there?

41:31.204 --> 41:32.622
No.

41:34.958 --> 41:36.918
Did you ever have a sweetheart?

41:39.963 --> 41:41.923
No.

41:43.049 --> 41:45.218
You never had a sweetheart?

41:49.305 --> 41:50.890
No.

41:52.725 --> 41:55.144
You're kidding me.

41:56.145 --> 42:00.566
A good-looking guy like you
must have had a million sweethearts.

42:04.112 --> 42:06.572
Your name's George, ain't it?

42:19.377 --> 42:23.423
- What the hell you doing out here?
- Nothing. Just trying to keep cool.

42:23.548 --> 42:25.842
- I ain't talking to you.
- Who you talking to?

42:25.967 --> 42:28.094
- I'm talking to him.
- His name's George.

42:28.219 --> 42:30.263
I know what his name is.

42:31.055 --> 42:33.266
What are you doin' out here?

42:33.391 --> 42:35.727
- Minding my own business.
- Yeah.

42:39.063 --> 42:41.357
The last guy I caught out in the barn,

42:41.482 --> 42:44.986
I beat the hell out of him
and kicked him off my ranch.

42:55.872 --> 42:59.125
- Get on back to the house.
- You don't own me, Curley.

42:59.250 --> 43:01.294
Shut up.

43:02.086 --> 43:04.130
Get back in the house.

43:40.958 --> 43:43.961
...very high. About 10,000, 12,000 feet.

43:57.266 --> 43:59.227
How do you like your pup, Lennie?

43:59.352 --> 44:02.688
I like that puppy.
It's white, like I wanted.

44:04.899 --> 44:06.943
- Lennie.
- Yeah.

44:07.735 --> 44:11.906
- I told you not to bring that pup in here.
- George, I ain't got no pup in here.

44:12.031 --> 44:15.743
George, give... give... Give it to me!

44:15.868 --> 44:19.914
George, give it to me.
George, I didn't mean no harm.

44:20.039 --> 44:23.167
George, please,
I'll take it back to the barn.

44:23.292 --> 44:25.503
I just want to feel him a little bit.

44:26.295 --> 44:28.339
All right.

44:29.882 --> 44:31.926
Don't you take him out no more.

44:43.396 --> 44:45.815
Jesus.

44:45.940 --> 44:48.234
He's still just like a kid, ain't he?

45:12.800 --> 45:15.261
Either of you guys got a slug of whisky?

45:16.303 --> 45:19.765
- I got a gut ache.
- I ain't. I'd drink it myself if I had.

45:21.017 --> 45:23.060
I ain't got no gut ache.

45:26.313 --> 45:27.898
Come here.

45:29.191 --> 45:32.111
God Almighty,
that dog of yours stinks, Candy.

45:32.236 --> 45:35.573
He's got no teeth.
He's all stiff from rheumatism.

45:35.698 --> 45:39.076
He ain't no good to ya.
Hell, he ain't no good to hisself.

45:39.660 --> 45:41.954
Why don't you just shoot him, Candy?

45:43.748 --> 45:45.374
Well!

45:45.499 --> 45:47.835
I couldn't do that.

45:47.960 --> 45:50.379
I had him too long.

45:50.504 --> 45:53.048
I herded sheep with him.

45:53.174 --> 45:55.843
That poor old dog
just suffers hisself all the time.

45:55.968 --> 45:58.596
No. No.

45:58.721 --> 46:00.765
Look.

46:03.893 --> 46:07.271
Take him out and shoot him
right in the back of the head.

46:07.396 --> 46:09.315
Right there.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.692
Hell, he'd never even know what hit him.

46:11.817 --> 46:13.652
Aw...

46:13.778 --> 46:15.988
I couldn't do that.

46:16.113 --> 46:18.532
I had him too long.

46:18.657 --> 46:21.911
I'll shoot him for ya.
Then it won't be you that done it.

46:22.036 --> 46:25.456
- No.
- Slim's bitch has got a litter right now.

46:25.581 --> 46:28.459
I'll bet you Slim would give you
one of her pups to raise.

46:28.584 --> 46:32.171
Sure. You can have
any one of them pups you want.

46:33.756 --> 46:35.633
No, no, no.

46:35.758 --> 46:37.676
Carlson's right, Candy.

46:37.801 --> 46:40.012
That dog ain't no good to hisself.

46:54.151 --> 46:56.487
Hey, Slim. Read this.

46:58.906 --> 47:03.827
"Dear Editor, I read your magazine
for six years. It's the best in the market."

47:03.953 --> 47:05.996
"I like stories by Peter Rand."

47:07.206 --> 47:11.001
- What you want me to read that for?
- Go on. Read the name at the bottom.

47:11.126 --> 47:14.547
- "Yours for success, William Tanner."
- You met Bill Tanner?

47:14.672 --> 47:17.216
Yeah. Bald-headed guy, drove a cultivator.

47:17.341 --> 47:19.551
That's him.

47:19.677 --> 47:24.056
Candy, if you want me to, I'll put
that old dog out of his misery right now.

47:24.181 --> 47:26.225
Won't hurt him at all.

47:31.063 --> 47:35.192
- Let's wait till tomorrow.
- I don't see why. Let's get it over with.

47:35.317 --> 47:38.237
We can't sleep
with that stinking dog in here.

47:59.049 --> 48:01.093
All right.

48:02.553 --> 48:04.305
Take him.

48:05.848 --> 48:07.891
Come on, boy. Come on.

48:09.059 --> 48:10.936
He won't even feel it.

48:11.061 --> 48:13.188
Come on, boy. Come on.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.323
Carlson...

48:24.908 --> 48:28.287
- Get a shovel.
- Yeah.

48:50.559 --> 48:52.603
Candy.

48:53.353 --> 48:55.856
You can have any one
of them pups you want.

49:06.909 --> 49:10.329
Uh... Does anybody
wanna play a little rummy?

49:10.454 --> 49:11.705
Yeah.

49:31.725 --> 49:33.769
You deal.

51:30.218 --> 51:32.179
Hey, hey.

51:35.515 --> 51:37.559
Hey, hey.

51:48.820 --> 51:50.447
- Slim?
- Yeah.

51:50.572 --> 51:53.492
I can't keep up with that guy.
It'll kill me.

51:53.617 --> 51:54.659
All right.

51:54.785 --> 51:56.328
- Jack!
- Yeah.

51:56.453 --> 51:57.579
Take Mike's place.

51:57.704 --> 51:59.456
- Aw, Slim.
- Just for a while.

51:59.581 --> 52:01.625
Mike, you take Jack's place.

52:03.335 --> 52:05.378
You're on there.

52:10.801 --> 52:13.970
So how long you and Lennie
been together, George?

52:14.096 --> 52:16.264
A long time. A real long time.

52:16.765 --> 52:21.019
Really? Seems kinda funny,
you two traveling around together.

52:21.978 --> 52:23.605
What's funny about it?

52:23.730 --> 52:27.359
Well, a cuckoo like him
and a smart guy like you.

52:27.484 --> 52:32.072
Well, I ain't so smart or I wouldn't be
bucking barley for my 50 bucks a month.

52:32.197 --> 52:33.824
I guess you're right.

52:38.954 --> 52:41.081
How'd you two meet up?

52:41.206 --> 52:43.250
Well, I knew his Aunt Clara.

52:44.584 --> 52:47.254
She took him when he was a boy.
She raised him up.

52:47.379 --> 52:50.215
When she died,
Lennie just come along with me working.

52:50.340 --> 52:51.716
Uh-huh.

52:53.593 --> 52:57.389
I used to play jokes on him cos he's
too damn dumb to take care of himself.

52:57.514 --> 53:00.225
He'd do any damn thing I told him.

53:02.227 --> 53:04.521
Put that on back in here.

53:04.646 --> 53:10.026
One day, a bunch of guys standing
around on the Sacramento River,

53:10.151 --> 53:13.071
I turns to him and
I says "Jump in, Lennie."

53:13.321 --> 53:14.906
And he jumps.

53:15.323 --> 53:19.828
Couldn't swim a stroke. He damn near
drowned before we could get to him.

53:19.953 --> 53:24.666
He was so damn nice to me for pulling
him out, he forgot I told him to jump in.

53:26.459 --> 53:28.503
He's a nice fella.

53:31.464 --> 53:34.926
A guy don't need no sense
to be a nice fella.

53:35.969 --> 53:38.013
Yeah.

53:38.138 --> 53:41.558
He gets in trouble all the time
cos he's so goddamn dumb.

53:41.683 --> 53:44.519
Like what happened up north in Weed.

53:49.983 --> 53:52.152
What'd he do in Weed?

53:56.573 --> 53:58.617
He seen this girl,

53:59.659 --> 54:01.077
in a red dress,

54:01.202 --> 54:04.456
and the dumb bastard
that he is, he just...

54:04.581 --> 54:09.669
He wants to touch everything he likes,
so he reaches out to touch this red dress.

54:11.379 --> 54:14.758
So the girl starts screaming,
and that gets Lennie all mixed up,

54:14.883 --> 54:18.011
so he holds on and he won't let go,

54:18.136 --> 54:20.889
cos that's the only thing
he can think to do.

54:22.349 --> 54:24.392
So what happened?

54:26.561 --> 54:29.272
Well, she runs off
across the field, screaming.

54:31.149 --> 54:33.943
So me and Lennie take off running.

54:34.069 --> 54:37.906
Pretty soon we hear a bunch of
guys with dogs coming after us.

54:40.492 --> 54:44.329
Had to hide in the irrigation ditch
until it was safe to get away.

54:45.955 --> 54:48.458
He didn't hurt the girl none?

54:50.418 --> 54:52.796
Hell, no. He just scared her.

54:55.423 --> 54:58.009
Well... he ain't mean.

54:59.469 --> 55:01.513
I can tell a mean guy a mile off.

55:02.764 --> 55:05.391
Milton!

55:05.642 --> 55:07.852
I ain't payin' you to stand around.

55:09.020 --> 55:12.398
- Get back to work.
- He just come over for a drink of water.

55:12.524 --> 55:17.070
You get back to work. You get
these men moving. They're way behind.

55:20.031 --> 55:22.700
You men get moving here. Let's go.

55:49.853 --> 55:52.146
Goddamnit, stop that racket!

56:17.422 --> 56:19.632
Lennie.

56:19.757 --> 56:22.719
I told you not to bring that pup in here.

56:22.844 --> 56:24.888
I ain't got no pup.

56:40.820 --> 56:44.741
- Any of you boys seen my wife?
- She ain't been here.

56:56.419 --> 56:59.339
- Where the hell's Slim?
- Went out to the barn.

57:06.679 --> 57:10.933
Carlson, do you think he's gonna find
Slim in the barn with his wife?

57:11.059 --> 57:13.519
Better not tangle with Slim.

57:14.062 --> 57:17.357
Curley's lookin' for a fight.
I gotta see this. Come on.

57:17.482 --> 57:19.942
No, I'll stay here. Thanks.

57:30.536 --> 57:34.248
- Was Curley's wife in the barn?
- If she was, I didn't see her.

57:43.132 --> 57:45.176
George.

57:46.135 --> 57:48.179
Both the ends is the same.

57:49.013 --> 57:53.768
- Why both the ends is the same?
- It's just the way they make 'em.

57:53.893 --> 57:57.438
You sure she didn't come in the barn,
like she come in here?

57:57.563 --> 57:59.524
No, she never.

57:59.649 --> 58:01.818
Give me a good whorehouse every time.

58:01.943 --> 58:03.986
A guy can go in, get drunk,

58:04.112 --> 58:07.115
get it all out of his system
all at once, and no messes.

58:09.909 --> 58:12.412
- George.
- Yeah?

58:14.330 --> 58:17.458
How long is it gonna be
till we get the little place

58:17.583 --> 58:19.669
and live off the fat of the land?

58:21.337 --> 58:23.798
Gotta get some money together first.

58:24.799 --> 58:28.719
I know a little place where you can get
cheap, but they ain't giving it away.

58:28.845 --> 58:30.763
Tell about that place.

58:35.601 --> 58:37.645
It's ten acres.

58:38.688 --> 58:42.525
It's got a windmill. Got a little shack
on it, and a chicken run.

58:42.692 --> 58:44.360
Got rabbits, George?

58:44.485 --> 58:48.447
I could easily build a few hutches
and you could feed 'em alfalfa.

58:48.573 --> 58:51.701
You're damn right.
You're goddamn right I could.

58:51.826 --> 58:54.745
But, George, tell about the house.

58:55.246 --> 59:00.334
Well, we have a little house,
and we have a room to ourself.

59:01.294 --> 59:05.923
And we have a little, fat, iron stove, and
in the winter we keep a fire going in it.

59:06.048 --> 59:11.095
And rabbits, George. And that... But
I tend 'em. How do I tend them rabbits?

59:11.220 --> 59:14.599
Well, you go out to the alfalfa field.
You have a sack.

59:14.765 --> 59:19.186
You fill up that sack and you bring it
in and you put it in the rabbit cage.

59:20.646 --> 59:23.608
You have a few pigeons
that fly around the windmill,

59:23.733 --> 59:26.277
like they done when I was a kid.

59:26.444 --> 59:28.696
And it'd be our home.

59:28.821 --> 59:30.740
Nobody could can us.

59:30.865 --> 59:34.201
We don't like a guy,
we just say "Get the hell out."

59:34.327 --> 59:36.621
If a friend come, we'd have an extra bunk.

59:36.746 --> 59:40.833
We'd say "Why don't you spend
the night?" and, by God, he would.

59:41.584 --> 59:43.669
We'd have a dog and a couple of cats,

59:43.794 --> 59:47.632
but you got to make sure
them cats don't get them rabbits.

59:49.467 --> 59:52.511
But... you just let them try.

59:52.637 --> 59:57.683
I'm gonna break them goddamn cats'
necks. I smash them cats with a stick.

59:58.934 --> 01:00:00.978
You know a place like this?

01:00:05.399 --> 01:00:07.735
Suppose I do. What's it to you?

01:00:08.944 --> 01:00:11.322
How much they want for a place like that?

01:00:12.782 --> 01:00:15.493
- Could get it for 600 bucks.
- 600.

01:00:15.618 --> 01:00:17.953
Old people that owns it is broke.

01:00:21.624 --> 01:00:24.293
I ain't much good with only one hand.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.383
That's why they give me a job sweeping.
And they give me $250 cos I lost my hand.

01:00:31.133 --> 01:00:33.552
And I got 50 more saved
in the bank right now.

01:00:33.678 --> 01:00:35.721
That's, uh... 300.

01:00:36.806 --> 01:00:39.725
And I got 50 more coming
at the end of the month.

01:00:42.728 --> 01:00:45.189
Suppose I went in with you fellas.

01:00:45.314 --> 01:00:47.817
That'd be $350 that I'd put in.

01:00:49.235 --> 01:00:51.570
Now, let me tell you something.
I could cook,

01:00:51.695 --> 01:00:53.739
and I could tend the chickens,

01:00:53.906 --> 01:00:57.410
and I could hoe in the garden. Huh?

01:00:57.535 --> 01:00:59.870
- Now, how would that be?
- Okay.

01:01:01.705 --> 01:01:04.708
I got to think about that.
We was gonna do it by ourselves.

01:01:04.834 --> 01:01:07.128
We were gonna do it by ourselves.

01:01:07.253 --> 01:01:10.089
Well, now, wait a minute.
I'll tell you what.

01:01:10.673 --> 01:01:15.469
I'd make a will and leave my share
to you guys in case I kick off.

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.764
I ain't got no relatives or nothin'.

01:01:18.889 --> 01:01:21.308
You fellas got any money?
Maybe we can do it now.

01:01:21.434 --> 01:01:24.353
- We got ten bucks between us.
- We got ten bucks.

01:01:24.478 --> 01:01:27.022
- Ten bucks.
- Yeah.

01:01:32.445 --> 01:01:35.156
You seen what they done to my dog?

01:01:35.281 --> 01:01:38.075
They said he wasn't no good no more.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.203
I wish somebody'd shoot me
when I ain't no good,

01:01:43.164 --> 01:01:45.541
but they won't do that.

01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:48.961
They'll can me, and I ain't
gonna have no place to go.

01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:13.861
Look, if me and Lennie work a month
and we don't spend nothin',

01:02:13.986 --> 01:02:16.780
we'll have 100 bucks. And you got 350?

01:02:16.989 --> 01:02:19.241
Yeah, and you can have every cent of it.

01:02:19.366 --> 01:02:21.410
That'd be 450.

01:02:22.244 --> 01:02:24.580
Jesus Christ,
I bet we could get it for that.

01:02:24.705 --> 01:02:27.750
You two could get her started.
I'd work and make up the rest.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:30.169
I'm gonna take that goddamn pup.

01:02:30.294 --> 01:02:32.713
Sure, sure, sure.
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:02:32.838 --> 01:02:35.633
I'll write those two old people
that we'll take it.

01:02:35.758 --> 01:02:37.760
Candy will send $100 to hold it?

01:02:37.885 --> 01:02:41.680
I sure will. I'll have 30 more dollars
the time you guys is ready to quit.

01:02:41.805 --> 01:02:45.225
I get to tend the rabbits.
Tell him, George. Tell him he can't do it.

01:02:45.351 --> 01:02:48.729
I'll get to hoe in the garden,
even if I ain't no good at it?

01:02:48.854 --> 01:02:52.441
- They got a nice stove there?
- Yeah, yeah. They got a real nice stove!

01:02:52.566 --> 01:02:54.568
But I bet that pup will like it there.

01:02:54.693 --> 01:02:58.822
We're gonna do it, goddamnit. We can fix
up that little old place and live there.

01:02:58.948 --> 01:03:00.950
When we gonna do it?

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:06.946
One month. Right smack in one month.

01:03:07.998 --> 01:03:09.917
Now, don't tell nobody about it.

01:03:10.042 --> 01:03:13.337
- Just us three and nobody else.
- Don't tell nobody.

01:03:13.462 --> 01:03:17.675
George, I ought to have
shot that dog myself.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.386
I should not let no stranger shoot my dog.

01:03:20.511 --> 01:03:23.222
- Shut up. I'm tired of...
- I just asked you!

01:03:23.347 --> 01:03:27.059
You've been asking me too often
and I'm damn sick of it.

01:03:27.184 --> 01:03:29.812
If you can't look after your goddamn wife,

01:03:29.937 --> 01:03:32.523
what do you expect me to do about it, huh?

01:03:33.023 --> 01:03:35.067
- Lay off me.
- Didn't mean nothing by it.

01:03:35.192 --> 01:03:37.986
- I said lay off.
- Just thought you might have seen her.

01:03:38.112 --> 01:03:40.614
- Tell her to stay home.
- You keep out of this.

01:03:40.739 --> 01:03:43.701
You goddamn punk.
You're yellow as a frog belly.

01:03:43.826 --> 01:03:46.120
You may be the best welterweight
in the country,

01:03:46.245 --> 01:03:48.662
but I'll kick your goddamn head in.

01:03:55.754 --> 01:03:58.132
What the hell you laughing about?

01:03:58.257 --> 01:04:00.801
Huh? You!

01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:05.764
Come on, you big bastard, get up.

01:04:07.391 --> 01:04:10.394
No big son of a bitch
is gonna laugh at me. Get up.

01:04:13.313 --> 01:04:16.066
- I'll show you who's yellow.
- You got no cause for...

01:04:16.191 --> 01:04:17.985
Get up!

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:20.529
- Come on, Curley!
- Get up and fight.

01:04:20.904 --> 01:04:25.200
- He didn't do nothing. Leave him alone.
- I didn't.

01:04:25.325 --> 01:04:27.369
Cut it out, Curley.

01:04:29.121 --> 01:04:31.415
- Fight back.
- Make him stop.

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.876
Get him, Lennie.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.254
Get him, Lennie! Get him!

01:04:51.643 --> 01:04:54.188
Get him off of me! Get him off of me!

01:04:55.689 --> 01:04:57.274
Lennie.

01:04:57.399 --> 01:04:59.776
Slim, help me.

01:04:59.902 --> 01:05:02.821
- Lennie.
- Oh, God!

01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:06.533
Lennie! Lennie!

01:05:08.035 --> 01:05:12.080
Lennie! Let go!
Lennie! Let go of his hand.

01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:14.958
Let go.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.961
Jesus.

01:05:18.086 --> 01:05:20.881
You told me to, George. You told me to.

01:05:21.006 --> 01:05:23.300
I know, I know.
Take it easy now. Calm down.

01:05:23.967 --> 01:05:26.220
We gotta get him to a doctor.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.934
Carlson, get the wagon hitched up. We'll
take him into Soledad to get him fixed up.

01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:34.728
I didn't wanna hurt him.
I didn't wanna hurt him.

01:05:34.853 --> 01:05:36.438
I know. I know.

01:05:36.563 --> 01:05:40.317
It ain't your fault, Lennie.
This punk had it coming to him.

01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:45.822
Slim, is Curley's old man
gonna can us now?

01:05:51.703 --> 01:05:53.997
Hey, you hear me?

01:05:54.122 --> 01:05:55.499
Huh? Hey!

01:05:55.624 --> 01:05:57.626
- You hear me?
- Huh?

01:05:59.294 --> 01:06:03.131
I think you got your hand
caught in a machine.

01:06:04.132 --> 01:06:08.011
Now, if you don't tell nobody
what happened, we ain't going to.

01:06:08.136 --> 01:06:11.264
But you just tell,
and try to get this guy canned,

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:14.017
we're gonna tell everybody
what really happened.

01:06:14.142 --> 01:06:17.771
- You got that? Huh?
- Uh-huh.

01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:20.732
George, you and Whitt,
give me a hand. Come on.

01:06:23.026 --> 01:06:25.195
Lift him up. That's it.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.364
Candy, get the door.

01:06:30.242 --> 01:06:32.744
Whitt, you go on into town with Carlson.

01:06:53.515 --> 01:06:55.183
George.

01:06:55.308 --> 01:06:57.352
Jesus, you look like hell.

01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.107
Do... do I still get to tend the rabbits?

01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:07.988
Sure, you ain't done nothing wrong.

01:07:14.953 --> 01:07:18.999
Thanks a lot. I didn't want no trouble.

01:07:24.713 --> 01:07:28.175
It's all right. I know you didn't.

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:36.433
Come on. You be quiet
so I can clean you up. Okay?

01:07:51.114 --> 01:07:53.241
Okay?

01:08:10.759 --> 01:08:12.802
Hi, boys.

01:08:16.223 --> 01:08:19.309
It's hot out here.
Not cool like in the barn.

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:34.658
I said it's hot out here!

01:08:36.451 --> 01:08:39.871
Why don't you go back to your house
now? We don't want no trouble.

01:08:39.996 --> 01:08:42.165
I ain't giving you no trouble.

01:08:46.419 --> 01:08:49.631
Think I don't like to talk
to somebody every once in a while?

01:08:49.756 --> 01:08:52.550
You got a husband. Go talk to him.

01:08:53.801 --> 01:08:57.846
Sure, I got a husband.
Swell guy, ain't he?

01:09:08.566 --> 01:09:11.319
Say, what happened to Curley's hand?

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.365
He got his hand caught in a machine.

01:09:17.367 --> 01:09:20.996
Baloney! What you think you're selling me?

01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:32.590
How'd you get them bruises on your face?

01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:38.220
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

01:09:42.267 --> 01:09:44.477
Got his hand caught in a machine.

01:09:50.316 --> 01:09:52.652
Yeah, okay.

01:10:32.066 --> 01:10:34.402
Lennie.

01:10:35.862 --> 01:10:38.031
I'm gonna go into town with the guys.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.910
- Can I stay here?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:42.035 --> 01:10:45.330
Just stay here for a while
and then go back to the bunkhouse.

01:10:45.455 --> 01:10:46.998
Okay.

01:10:47.123 --> 01:10:48.792
Come on, George.

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.753
Don't you get in no trouble.

01:11:25.161 --> 01:11:27.497
You ain't got no right
to come into my room.

01:11:27.622 --> 01:11:30.959
Ain't nobody got a right
to be in here but me.

01:11:31.292 --> 01:11:35.088
- I... I seen your light.
- Yeah, well, I got a right to have a light.

01:11:35.213 --> 01:11:39.092
Now, I ain't wanted in those bunkhouses
and you ain't wanted in my room.

01:11:39.217 --> 01:11:42.554
- Why ain't you wanted?
- Because I'm black.

01:11:44.389 --> 01:11:47.809
They say I stink. Well, I'll tell you,
all of y'all stink to me.

01:11:51.729 --> 01:11:53.982
Everybody went into town.

01:11:55.483 --> 01:11:59.779
- Well, what you want?
- Nothing. I see... I...

01:11:59.904 --> 01:12:01.781
I seen your light.

01:12:03.992 --> 01:12:08.871
Well, come on in and sit awhile if you
won't get out of here and leave me alone.

01:12:11.207 --> 01:12:13.251
Goddamn your soul.

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:33.521
All the boys go into town?

01:12:33.646 --> 01:12:38.985
All but old Candy. He just sat in
the bunkhouse, figuring about the rabbits.

01:12:39.318 --> 01:12:41.529
What rabbits you talkin' about?

01:12:41.654 --> 01:12:45.324
The rabbits we're gonna get,
and I get to tend 'em.

01:12:47.368 --> 01:12:51.330
You're nuts. You're crazy as a wedge.

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:55.626
I don't blame that guy you travel with
for keeping you out of sight.

01:12:55.752 --> 01:12:59.922
No, every word is the truth.
You can ask George.

01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:03.009
You travel around with George, don't you?

01:13:03.176 --> 01:13:05.553
Sure. Me and George
go everywhere together.

01:13:05.678 --> 01:13:09.223
And sometimes he talk to you
and you don't understand

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:12.143
what the hell he's talking about.
Ain't that so?

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:19.400
How long do you think it's gonna be

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:24.113
before them puppies are old enough
to take away from its mother?

01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:29.410
Boy, I tell you.

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:33.915
A guy can talk to you and be sure
you ain't gonna go blabbing. Uh-uh!

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.128
Just talking
and you don't understand nothing.

01:13:41.631 --> 01:13:46.511
It don't make no difference if you
don't hear or understand, you just...

01:13:48.638 --> 01:13:50.681
...talking.

01:13:52.683 --> 01:13:54.727
Just talking.

01:13:55.478 --> 01:13:58.856
Just being with another guy.

01:14:00.358 --> 01:14:02.401
That's all.

01:14:04.362 --> 01:14:06.405
Suppose...

01:14:08.533 --> 01:14:11.244
George don't come back no more.

01:14:11.369 --> 01:14:13.663
What you do then?

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.418
What?

01:14:19.544 --> 01:14:23.130
I said suppose George go into town tonight

01:14:23.256 --> 01:14:25.550
and you never heard of him no more.

01:14:26.217 --> 01:14:28.844
George would never do nothing like that.

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:32.473
Well, suppose he get hurt
or killed and he can't come back.

01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:37.019
George can't get killed
cos George is careful.

01:14:37.144 --> 01:14:40.982
Well, just suppose. Suppose he don't
come back. What you do then?

01:14:41.107 --> 01:14:43.776
I don't know.
Gee, why are you doing anyways?

01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:47.572
- That ain't true. George ain't hurt.
- Shall I tell you what'd happen?

01:14:47.697 --> 01:14:51.784
They'd take you to the booby hatch
and lock you up with a collar, like a dog.

01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:54.620
- Who'll hurt George?
- Just supposin'.

01:14:54.745 --> 01:14:57.999
George ain't hurt. He's all right.
He's gonna come back.

01:14:58.124 --> 01:15:00.334
- Then what you supposing for?
- Oh, I...

01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:02.378
Ain't nobody talk no hurt to George.

01:15:02.503 --> 01:15:05.506
Just keep calm.
Now, now, George ain't hurt.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:09.218
Ain't nobody talk no hurt
to George. George'll be back.

01:15:09.343 --> 01:15:12.388
All right, all right, all right.
Just sit down.

01:15:12.513 --> 01:15:14.557
Calm down.

01:15:16.517 --> 01:15:18.561
Go on.

01:15:35.328 --> 01:15:37.872
Maybe you can see now.

01:15:37.997 --> 01:15:42.168
You got George.
Suppose you ain't got nobody.

01:15:42.376 --> 01:15:47.131
Suppose you can't go into the bunkhouse
and play rummy because you's black.

01:15:47.256 --> 01:15:50.718
Suppose you have to sit out here
with the mules and read books.

01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:52.887
Books ain't no good.

01:15:53.012 --> 01:15:55.723
A guy goes nuts, he ain't got nobody.

01:15:55.848 --> 01:16:00.102
I tell ya, a guy gets too lonely,
he gets sick.

01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:06.275
Maybe George come back already.
Maybe I better go see.

01:16:07.443 --> 01:16:10.154
I... I didn't mean to scare you.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:12.406
George gonna come back all right.

01:16:12.531 --> 01:16:16.077
I was just talking
about myself, that's all.

01:16:31.133 --> 01:16:35.888
We're gonna get a little place of land
and rabbits and windmill.

01:16:37.473 --> 01:16:39.850
You're nuts.

01:16:40.768 --> 01:16:42.269
Lennie!

01:16:42.394 --> 01:16:45.523
- That's George. George is back.
- Yeah.

01:16:45.648 --> 01:16:47.691
I'm in here, George.

01:16:50.152 --> 01:16:52.154
You shouldn't be in here.

01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:54.990
Yeah, well, I told him,
but he come on in anyway.

01:16:55.115 --> 01:16:57.701
- Why didn't you kick him out?
- Well, I...

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:01.372
I guess I didn't care much.

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:05.334
Come on.

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:17.137
Night.

01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:26.647
George, I thought
you were gonna stay in town.

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:29.817
- Well, why'd you think that?
- That nigger told me.

01:17:29.942 --> 01:17:31.986
He tell you got hurt.

01:17:32.111 --> 01:17:34.613
Hey!

01:17:35.698 --> 01:17:38.325
Did you see Curley in town?

01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:41.287
No.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:45.499
He went into town.
His old man went into town, too.

01:17:47.418 --> 01:17:49.378
Yeah.

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:52.047
I couldn't even play my records tonight.

01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:54.758
I got no records left. I had four.

01:17:54.883 --> 01:18:01.807
"Am I Blue", "Little by Little", "Button Up
Your Overcoat" and "Ten Cents a Dance".

01:18:03.392 --> 01:18:06.937
Curley got mad at me after supper,
broke all my records.

01:18:23.537 --> 01:18:26.290
I know how you got them bruises
on your face.

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:30.669
And how Curley got his hand busted.

01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:35.841
He got his hand caught in a machine.

01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:43.098
Yeah. All right.

01:18:44.933 --> 01:18:46.977
If you say so.

01:18:50.898 --> 01:18:55.402
Someday I'm going into town,
and no one's ever gonna see me again.

01:18:55.527 --> 01:19:00.782
Not Curley, not his old man,
not a damn one of you bindle stiffs!

01:19:11.877 --> 01:19:13.921
George, she's crying.

01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.383
George, why is she crying?

01:19:22.262 --> 01:19:24.306
I don't know.

01:20:03.804 --> 01:20:06.974
- I finished the letter.
- Oh, that's good. Good, that's good.

01:20:07.099 --> 01:20:09.268
Maybe we should send the binding money?

01:20:09.393 --> 01:20:11.687
No, no. Let's wait
till we hear back from 'em.

01:20:11.812 --> 01:20:16.650
- Well, I hope they ain't already sold it.
- Oh, don't you worry about that.

01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:21.321
George, I'll tell you what. I'd feel
a lot better sending the money now.

01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:23.907
Well, let me think about it.

01:20:24.032 --> 01:20:29.162
You know, I could hardly sleep last night,
thinking about us getting that farm.

01:20:32.124 --> 01:20:33.959
We'll be there before you know it.

01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:38.422
Come on, Crooks, put it in.

01:20:40.173 --> 01:20:42.134
Oh, good shot.

01:20:42.259 --> 01:20:44.303
That's the way.

01:20:44.428 --> 01:20:46.471
Still in there.

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:07.117
Why did you get killed?

01:21:09.536 --> 01:21:12.289
You ain't seen so little as the mice.

01:21:19.504 --> 01:21:25.844
George is never gonna let me tend
my rabbits if he finds out you got killed.

01:21:32.976 --> 01:21:35.020
Come on, George.

01:21:35.312 --> 01:21:37.356
Put that ringer on.

01:21:43.612 --> 01:21:45.656
One of 'em got very close.

01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:50.827
- Okay, Slim, come on.
- Shut up, Smiley.

01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:03.006
- Ringer time.
- Ringer time.

01:22:26.822 --> 01:22:28.865
What you got there, sonny boy?

01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:41.294
George says I ain't got
nothing to do with you.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.549
George giving you orders about everything?

01:22:45.674 --> 01:22:48.051
I ain't gonna talk to you or nothing.

01:22:49.177 --> 01:22:51.638
The guys got
a horseshoe tournament going on.

01:22:51.763 --> 01:22:53.807
None of them guys is gonna leave.

01:22:56.685 --> 01:22:59.980
Why can't I talk to you?
I never get to talk to nobody.

01:23:02.023 --> 01:23:04.067
I get awful lonely.

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:08.321
I ain't supposed to talk to you.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:13.493
You can talk to people,
but I can't talk to nobody but Curley,

01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:15.662
or else he gets mad.

01:23:16.496 --> 01:23:18.790
How'd you like not to talk to anybody?

01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:32.345
What you got covered up there?

01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:36.558
I...

01:23:41.396 --> 01:23:43.023
That's the pup.

01:23:45.233 --> 01:23:47.152
That's the little pup.

01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:52.574
Why, it's dead.

01:23:58.955 --> 01:24:01.875
But I was just playin' with him.

01:24:06.463 --> 01:24:08.506
Don't you worry none.

01:24:09.215 --> 01:24:11.676
He's just a mutt.
You can get another one, easy.

01:24:11.801 --> 01:24:17.349
Well, it ain't that so much, but George
ain't gonna let me tend them rabbits now.

01:24:17.474 --> 01:24:20.810
- Why don't he?
- Well, he said when...

01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:27.233
I did any bad things, then I wouldn't
be able to tend them rabbits.

01:24:31.071 --> 01:24:33.365
Don't you worry about talking to me.

01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:37.410
Listen to the guys yell.
They ain't gonna leave till it's over.

01:24:37.535 --> 01:24:41.915
I ain't supposed to talk to you. George
said he'd give me hell. He told me this.

01:24:42.123 --> 01:24:44.459
Well, what's the matter with me?

01:24:44.584 --> 01:24:46.753
Ain't I got a right to talk to nobody?

01:24:47.462 --> 01:24:50.173
George says you get the people in a mess.

01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:53.635
Oh, nuts.

01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.181
What kinda harm am I doing to you?

01:25:03.103 --> 01:25:06.189
I tell ya, I ain't used
to living like this.

01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:08.900
I could've made something outta myself.

01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:11.903
Maybe I will yet.

01:25:13.154 --> 01:25:17.909
A show come through Salinas,
and I met one of the actors.

01:25:18.034 --> 01:25:20.078
He says I could go with the show.

01:25:20.745 --> 01:25:24.249
My old lady wouldn't let me,
but this guy says I coulda.

01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:28.169
If I went, I wouldn't be
living like this. You bet.

01:25:28.294 --> 01:25:32.048
Say, we were supposed to get
a little place and then get rabbits.

01:25:49.607 --> 01:25:54.571
Another time, I met a guy -
he was in the pictures.

01:25:54.696 --> 01:25:57.782
Went out to the
Riverside Dance Palace with him.

01:25:58.908 --> 01:26:01.619
He says he was gonna put me in the movies.

01:26:01.744 --> 01:26:03.788
He says I was a natural.

01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:08.751
As soon as he got back to Hollywood
he was gonna write to me about it.

01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:12.630
I never did get that letter.

01:26:14.799 --> 01:26:18.178
I always thought
my old lady stole it, too.

01:26:18.303 --> 01:26:20.346
She said no.

01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:26.311
So, um... I married Curley.

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:30.315
Met him out at the Riverside Dance Palace
that same night.

01:26:33.443 --> 01:26:35.612
- Are you listenin'?
- Sure.

01:26:38.865 --> 01:26:41.075
I ain't told this to nobody before.

01:26:42.118 --> 01:26:44.162
And maybe I oughtn't to.

01:26:48.082 --> 01:26:50.126
I don't like Curley.

01:26:51.878 --> 01:26:54.422
He ain't a nice fella.

01:26:58.676 --> 01:27:00.970
I could've been in the movies.

01:27:01.095 --> 01:27:03.139
Had nice clothes.

01:27:04.307 --> 01:27:06.351
This guy said I was a natural.

01:27:08.394 --> 01:27:12.607
Maybe if you took this pup
and you throwed him away,

01:27:12.732 --> 01:27:17.946
then George would never know and I'd
get to tend them rabbits with no trouble.

01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:25.703
What makes you so nuts about rabbits?

01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:30.500
I like to pet nice things
with the fingers. Soft things.

01:27:30.625 --> 01:27:33.127
Well, who don't? Everybody likes that.

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:36.923
Do you like to feel velvet?

01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:39.968
You bet, by God.

01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:44.931
I had me some too. The lady
give me some and then I lost it.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.686
You're nuts.

01:27:49.811 --> 01:27:52.063
But you're kinda a nice fella.

01:27:52.188 --> 01:27:54.232
Just like a big baby.

01:27:57.026 --> 01:28:01.739
Sometimes when I'm doing my hair,
I just sit and stroke it cos it's so soft.

01:28:03.282 --> 01:28:05.326
Feel right here.

01:28:26.848 --> 01:28:29.350
That's nice.

01:28:29.475 --> 01:28:31.519
Like it, don't ya?

01:28:33.438 --> 01:28:35.773
I like it too. It feels nice.

01:28:35.898 --> 01:28:37.942
That's nice.

01:28:48.244 --> 01:28:50.371
That's nice.

01:28:50.913 --> 01:28:52.957
Don't mess it up.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.964
Look out now. You'll mess it up.

01:29:02.383 --> 01:29:04.552
Don't muss it up.

01:29:05.928 --> 01:29:07.763
Let go.

01:29:07.889 --> 01:29:10.224
Let go. You let go.

01:29:10.349 --> 01:29:12.435
- Don't. Don't.
- Let go.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.920
- Let go!
- Sssh! Sssh!

01:29:15.403 --> 01:29:17.231
Hey, no.

01:29:17.356 --> 01:29:19.066
Hey, don't do none of that.

01:29:19.192 --> 01:29:21.235
Please, don't you go yelling.

01:29:23.154 --> 01:29:25.198
Don't! Don't you go yelling.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.401
Don't! Don't!

01:29:30.578 --> 01:29:32.622
Don't yell! Don't do that!

01:29:34.207 --> 01:29:36.334
George is gonna be mad if you yell.

01:29:45.509 --> 01:29:49.138
Don't wanna hurt you,
but you're gonna get me in trouble.

01:29:54.185 --> 01:29:56.229
You done a bad thing.

01:30:02.735 --> 01:30:04.779
I done a bad thing.

01:30:07.073 --> 01:30:09.784
I done a really bad thing.

01:31:35.411 --> 01:31:37.538
Lennie! Lennie!

01:31:37.663 --> 01:31:40.249
Lennie, I got something here to show you.

01:31:43.627 --> 01:31:45.671
I didn't know you was out here.

01:31:51.844 --> 01:31:53.888
You oughtn't to sleep out here.

01:31:58.601 --> 01:32:00.644
Jesus Christ.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.484
Hey!

01:33:01.247 --> 01:33:03.290
Damn.

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.814
What are we gonna do now, George?

01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:34.905
- We oughta tell the guys.
- No, no.

01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:37.283
We oughta let him get away.

01:33:37.408 --> 01:33:39.952
You don't know that Curley.

01:33:40.077 --> 01:33:42.538
Curley's gonna wanna get him lynched.

01:33:50.879 --> 01:33:53.007
I ain't gonna let him hurt Lennie.

01:34:08.272 --> 01:34:11.567
All right, now, listen.
The guys might think I was in on it.

01:34:11.692 --> 01:34:15.612
So I'm gonna go in the bunkhouse,
and then you give me a minute,

01:34:16.405 --> 01:34:19.700
then you come out
and tell the guys about her,

01:34:19.825 --> 01:34:24.371
and then I'll come along and make
like I never seen her. Will you do that?

01:34:25.122 --> 01:34:27.166
Sure, George.

01:35:10.167 --> 01:35:12.336
Slim! Slim!

01:35:13.045 --> 01:35:15.088
Something happened to Curley's wife.

01:35:15.214 --> 01:35:17.132
Come quick. Come quick. Come on.

01:35:17.257 --> 01:35:19.551
Come on, come on, come on!

01:35:19.676 --> 01:35:23.180
- What the hell's going on, Candy?
- Let's go see.

01:35:23.305 --> 01:35:25.349
Come on.

01:35:32.356 --> 01:35:34.399
Move it.

01:35:42.157 --> 01:35:44.284
She ain't moving.

01:36:03.929 --> 01:36:07.224
I know who done it.
That little son of a bitch done it.

01:36:10.394 --> 01:36:13.146
I'm gonna get him.

01:36:13.272 --> 01:36:17.442
I'm gonna get my rifle and I'm gonna
kill that son of a bitch myself.

01:36:19.361 --> 01:36:22.572
- I'll get my gun.
- I'll go with you.

01:36:22.698 --> 01:36:24.741
Tom, let's get the horses.

01:36:33.917 --> 01:36:36.253
I guess Lennie done it, all right. Her...

01:36:36.378 --> 01:36:38.714
Her neck's bust.

01:36:38.839 --> 01:36:40.882
Lennie could've done that?

01:36:45.554 --> 01:36:49.599
- Well, I guess we gotta get him.
- Couldn't you bring him in...

01:36:49.725 --> 01:36:51.810
and... and lock him up?

01:36:51.935 --> 01:36:54.479
He's nuts. He never done this to be mean.

01:36:54.938 --> 01:36:57.649
If we could keep Curley in, we might.

01:36:57.774 --> 01:37:00.235
But Curley's gonna wanna shoot him.

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.948
And suppose they lock him up and strap
him down and put him in a cage?

01:37:05.073 --> 01:37:07.492
That ain't no good, George.

01:37:08.201 --> 01:37:10.245
Come on, men. Let's get a move on it.

01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:12.748
That bastard stole my gun.
It ain't in my bunk.

01:37:12.873 --> 01:37:15.125
Nigger's got a shotgun. Take his.

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:18.253
Curley, maybe you'd better
stay here with your wife.

01:37:18.378 --> 01:37:20.839
Oh, no, goddamnit.

01:37:20.964 --> 01:37:23.675
I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch myself.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.261
Come on, let's move!

01:37:47.616 --> 01:37:50.911
Whitt, Mike, Carlson,
you fellas ride with me.

01:37:54.247 --> 01:37:59.252
Anybody finds him, hold him till I get there
cos I want the first crack at him.

01:38:00.462 --> 01:38:03.840
Slim! Take your men south.
I'm gonna take my men north.

01:38:04.758 --> 01:38:07.093
Let 'em go. Come on, move out!

01:38:08.595 --> 01:38:10.806
Move it.

01:38:37.082 --> 01:38:39.125
Come on, let's go.

01:38:55.517 --> 01:38:58.436
What you gonna do? George?

01:38:58.562 --> 01:39:02.107
- Find Lennie before they get to him.
- Are you gonna help him get away?

01:39:02.232 --> 01:39:04.985
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:40:06.671 --> 01:40:08.715
Lennie.

01:40:09.549 --> 01:40:11.593
Lennie!

01:40:25.648 --> 01:40:28.109
Lennie!

01:40:33.323 --> 01:40:34.908
George.

01:40:35.033 --> 01:40:37.786
George, I didn't...
I didn't forget, George.

01:40:37.911 --> 01:40:41.706
I didn't... I didn't remember
where we was, but I didn't forget.

01:40:41.831 --> 01:40:43.917
- I just... I couldn't find it.
- It's okay.

01:40:44.042 --> 01:40:46.086
- I couldn't find it.
- It's okay.

01:40:47.754 --> 01:40:49.964
Okay?

01:40:50.632 --> 01:40:52.675
I didn't forget what you told me.

01:40:53.676 --> 01:40:55.470
It's okay.

01:40:57.806 --> 01:40:59.641
It's okay.

01:41:23.122 --> 01:41:25.166
George?

01:41:26.334 --> 01:41:28.378
Yeah?

01:41:30.255 --> 01:41:32.966
Ain't ya gonna give me hell?

01:41:34.551 --> 01:41:36.678
Like... like you done before?

01:41:36.803 --> 01:41:41.808
Like "If I didn't have you, I'd take
my 50 bucks, go into a cathouse..."

01:41:41.933 --> 01:41:43.977
Jesus Christ, Lennie.

01:41:45.895 --> 01:41:48.982
You can't remember nothing that happens,

01:41:49.107 --> 01:41:51.234
but you remember every word I say.

01:41:53.194 --> 01:41:55.864
I thought you was mad at me, George.

01:41:58.116 --> 01:42:00.159
No.

01:42:03.204 --> 01:42:05.248
I ain't mad.

01:42:06.958 --> 01:42:09.127
I ain't never been mad.

01:42:11.045 --> 01:42:14.549
You ain't gonna leave me, George.
I know you ain't.

01:42:16.968 --> 01:42:19.012
Nope.

01:42:21.556 --> 01:42:24.350
George, I done... I done a bad thing.

01:42:31.399 --> 01:42:33.443
It don't make no difference.

01:42:46.789 --> 01:42:48.833
George...

01:42:54.047 --> 01:42:57.383
George, where are we gonna go now?

01:43:01.387 --> 01:43:03.931
I don't know.

01:43:05.141 --> 01:43:07.018
I... I like it here.

01:43:12.982 --> 01:43:16.027
George, tell me like you done before.

01:43:16.152 --> 01:43:18.696
About them other guys and about us.

01:43:24.243 --> 01:43:26.788
George, tell it like you done before.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.708
Okay.

01:43:33.002 --> 01:43:35.046
Okay.

01:43:37.256 --> 01:43:40.343
You look over there. Okay? I'll tell ya.

01:43:41.552 --> 01:43:43.805
So you can almost see it. Okay?

01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:45.598
- Where?
- Over there.

01:43:50.895 --> 01:43:53.022
- Okay? Over there.
- Okay.

01:43:54.899 --> 01:43:57.235
Guys like us, they got no family.

01:43:59.987 --> 01:44:02.865
They ain't got nobody
who gives a hoot in hell about 'em.

01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:06.410
But not us, George.
That's it, George. But not us.

01:44:06.536 --> 01:44:08.579
Tell about us now.

01:44:12.416 --> 01:44:14.460
- Not us.
- Because...

01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:18.172
- Cos I got you.
- And I got you, George.

01:44:18.297 --> 01:44:21.300
That's what gives a hoot in hell about us.

01:44:21.425 --> 01:44:24.262
George, but tell now how it's gonna be.

01:44:27.515 --> 01:44:29.559
We're gonna get a little place.

01:44:30.893 --> 01:44:34.355
Okay. Yeah. We're gonna get
a little place and we're gonna...

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.524
- We're gonna...
- ...have...

01:44:37.733 --> 01:44:42.530
We're gonna have a cow, and some pigs,
and we're gonna have maybe a chicken.

01:44:43.281 --> 01:44:46.868
- Down in the flat, we'll have a...
- Field of alfalfa for the rabbits.

01:44:46.993 --> 01:44:50.204
- For the rabbits...
- And I get to tend the rabbits.

01:50:22.578 --> 01:50:25.038
