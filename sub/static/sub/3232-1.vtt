01:42.400 --> 01:45.790
What is this? It's blue.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.679
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.838
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.072
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.916
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.477
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.278
Just remember
who you're working for.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.592
What did you say?

02:27.800 --> 02:30.473
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.150
Like they don't already know that?

02:34.040 --> 02:36.873
Are you saying that they're stupid?

02:37.640 --> 02:40.074
No, I'm just saying.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.794
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.514
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.073
Is that it?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.191
Is that what you're doing?

02:49.400 --> 02:52.437
Tuco. Tuco.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.679
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.470
Heisenberg says relax.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.271
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela--

03:23.960 --> 03:26.474
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

03:29.560 --> 03:30.595
Yeah, that's messed up.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.072
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.030
Adjusting for inflation....

04:30.240 --> 04:32.834
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

04:33.040 --> 04:34.473
...say, $45,000 a year.

04:34.680 --> 04:40.391
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.434
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.553
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.389
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

04:53.240 --> 04:54.593
...say, 2 grand a month.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.156
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

04:58.360 --> 05:03.957
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.439
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.390
Seven thirty-seven.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.359
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.755
That is what I need.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.199
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.119
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.632
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.790
It's doable. Definitely doable.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.154
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.229
Heisenberg!

06:24.880 --> 06:27.440
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

06:28.520 --> 06:29.748
What's the matter with you?

06:29.960 --> 06:33.157
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.952
-Oh, damn, Tuco.
-Shut up!

06:36.360 --> 06:38.316
There's no pulse.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.875
-Do something.
-Do something?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.310
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.795
Do something! You're smart, right?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.274
Do that-- Do that thing.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.518
No, there's not-- There's nothing.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.073
Breathe into his mouth.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.475
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.195
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.672
No.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.594
Get rid of him.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.836
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.758
Buzzards and rats and all that.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.475
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.479
That sounds like arguing.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.236
Gonzo, hurry up.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.115
What's the big hurry?

08:55.480 --> 08:59.393
Oh, l.... I just think we're done here.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.397
Oh, yeah?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.391
You're done.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.674
Hey, I'm back here.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.397
Hello?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.195
Are already married--

10:57.400 --> 10:58.753
Hello?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.591
Thank you to our viewers--

11:03.800 --> 11:05.631
Hey.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.516
The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 a.m.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.273
Walt?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.429
Didn't you hear me?

11:17.360 --> 11:18.349
Walt.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.398
Walt.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.629
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.990
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

11:34.800 --> 11:36.597
Are you okay?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.872
Great.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.195
New hat?

11:47.520 --> 11:49.033
Yeah.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.872
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.832
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

11:55.040 --> 11:58.749
But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...

11:58.960 --> 12:02.316
...Iike airports, golf courses--

12:16.800 --> 12:18.836
Where've you been?

12:47.880 --> 12:49.438
What is...?

12:54.320 --> 12:55.309
What are you doing?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.478
Okay.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.670
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.791
Let me clean up first, okay?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.834
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so....

13:07.040 --> 13:09.838
Okay. Yeah, just....

13:10.040 --> 13:12.395
Okay. Enough.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.556
Hold up. Stop it.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.795
Stop it!

14:04.400 --> 14:09.349
I know you're scared...

14:10.200 --> 14:14.637
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

14:15.640 --> 14:20.430
But you cannot take it out on me.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.949
Hey, I'm home.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.275
Oh, we are dead.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.835
Dead, man.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.508
Ruto or rute
or however the hell you--

15:48.720 --> 15:50.472
-This is conjecture.
-This is conjecture?

15:50.680 --> 15:52.511
-Conjecture isn't helping.
-Conjecture--?

15:52.720 --> 15:55.917
-We need to state the facts.
-Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

15:56.120 --> 15:59.112
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.992
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

16:01.200 --> 16:03.430
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.995
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.634
What is that, conjecture?

16:08.840 --> 16:12.310
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

16:12.520 --> 16:16.752
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

16:16.960 --> 16:19.679
And that way--
That way he just kept staring at us...

16:19.880 --> 16:23.316
...saying, "You're done."

16:23.520 --> 16:24.475
"You're done"?

16:24.680 --> 16:27.194
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.153
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.828
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.156
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

16:35.360 --> 16:39.638
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

16:40.720 --> 16:44.872
What happens
when he decides "no"?

16:53.520 --> 16:54.509
No.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.359
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

17:07.640 --> 17:09.994
-How would you do it?
-What do you mean, how?

17:10.200 --> 17:13.556
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.597
All right.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.473
Say we set up one last sale.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.752
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.031
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

17:27.240 --> 17:31.392
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

17:33.320 --> 17:34.309
So three shots?

17:34.960 --> 17:38.077
-Three shots or, I don't know, two.
-Wait, is it two, or is it three?

17:38.280 --> 17:40.555
-Two would probably work, I guess.
-Okay, two shots.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.159
Two in the chest, in the face?

17:42.360 --> 17:45.670
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.316
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.476
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

17:52.680 --> 17:54.636
-...he's probably coming at you, right?
-Yeah.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.910
-You turn toward him.
-Yeah, just wheel on him--

17:57.120 --> 17:58.872
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.399
How many shots does that take?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.318
-I don't know. Three shots.
-Three shots.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.193
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.913
Now, is there anyone else there?

18:08.120 --> 18:11.112
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

18:11.320 --> 18:15.757
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.192
All right.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.550
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.637
At this point, how many shots fired?

18:25.840 --> 18:28.718
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

18:33.520 --> 18:35.397
It's not--

18:44.600 --> 18:47.433
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

18:47.640 --> 18:50.154
...and you can't even open the gun?

18:52.920 --> 18:57.357
-It's not that easy, is it?
-Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.031
Yeah.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.311
Call Skyler.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.678
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.236
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.715
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.388
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

19:37.600 --> 19:38.999
...over by UNM tonight...

19:39.200 --> 19:41.589
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.791
Listen to me. "Hang."

19:44.000 --> 19:47.151
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.873
I'm still hip.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.028
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.993
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

19:55.200 --> 20:00.149
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

20:00.360 --> 20:05.150
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

20:05.360 --> 20:07.920
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

20:08.120 --> 20:12.636
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.229
I wonder if that ever happens.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.830
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.196
Skyler didn't pick up?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.468
Obviously she's not home.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.155
Baby. Baby, wait up.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.555
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

20:37.760 --> 20:39.637
Dinner tonight. That new place.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.469
-How late they serve?
-I don't know.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.477
You got Dave at 8.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.520
-Not tonight.
-Yeah, you do. Remember?

20:50.720 --> 20:52.233
No, that's Thursday.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.716
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.115
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

20:59.320 --> 21:01.834
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.031
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.309
And I'm doing them, Hank.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.318
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.592
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.870
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.997
Look, it's.... You know, it's just....

21:26.200 --> 21:27.792
Oh, boy. I....

21:28.000 --> 21:33.028
I think Dave is really helping you.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.478
Yeah.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.309
Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:53.989
Sorry about that.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.431
She's....

22:08.760 --> 22:12.036
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

22:13.760 --> 22:16.558
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

22:16.760 --> 22:19.194
-...and then he says, "Give me a four."
-Hey, Gomez.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.834
Gomez? What do you got for me?

22:22.040 --> 22:23.951
Come on. Chop-chop.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.469
Good morning to you too.

22:29.880 --> 22:33.031
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.073
-You know Southwest Aniline, right?
-Yeah, off the 25?

22:36.280 --> 22:37.429
The place smells like feet.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.790
This is them. Check this out.

22:41.920 --> 22:46.391
-Holy shit. What was that?
-Thermite. So they tell me.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.272
Burns about 5000 degrees.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.391
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.115
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.157
Wait. I take that back.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.989
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

23:03.200 --> 23:06.795
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.718
It rolls. Jesus.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.668
-So, what'd they get?
-Methylamine, 30 gallons.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.911
P2P?

23:17.120 --> 23:19.873
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.668
Who the hell still does that?

23:21.880 --> 23:24.553
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.192
Pseudo's in short supply...

23:27.400 --> 23:30.790
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.468
That and the thermite...

23:33.680 --> 23:35.750
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.520
-But ranking them as burglars?
-Shit.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.439
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.757
They got book learning
but no street skills.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.279
Maybe they're college kids.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.232
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.556
Yeah, maybe.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.228
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor....

23:53.440 --> 23:56.398
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.912
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

24:01.120 --> 24:03.759
...and not those boys from Juarez.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.513
Your daughter wants out.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.918
Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.634
We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.995
Hey, it's me.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.633
Thought I'd try you earlier...

26:07.840 --> 26:11.310
...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.714
I'm realising now...

26:12.920 --> 26:15.798
...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...

26:16.000 --> 26:19.151
...owing to the extra baby weight--

26:21.120 --> 26:22.633
Hey, sweetie.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.794
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.438
No.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.711
No, no. Well, not all of it.

26:37.720 --> 26:42.396
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of--
My stomach, you know.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.434
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.679
-How would he know where I live?
-You sure it was Tuco?

27:15.880 --> 27:16.915
Who else could it be?

27:17.120 --> 27:19.076
-Did you ever tell him my name?
-No.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.157
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

27:21.360 --> 27:23.157
-No.
-What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

27:23.360 --> 27:25.430
-Did you tell them anything?
-I didn't say jack.

27:25.640 --> 27:29.030
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

27:29.240 --> 27:33.199
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.350
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.437
Oh, God. What happens then?

27:49.320 --> 27:51.436
Look, it's got five bullets.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.872
I finally figured out how to....
Look, I just finally-- I figured it out.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.548
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.514
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.392
I mean, mathematically.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.629
I've got a better idea.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.596
Thank God.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.119
All right.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.550
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.678
-Beans.
-Beans?

28:21.400 --> 28:24.073
They're castor beans.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.838
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.389
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

28:29.600 --> 28:31.113
Climb it and escape?

28:32.320 --> 28:34.629
We are going to process them
into ricin.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.359
Rice and beans?

28:39.480 --> 28:42.313
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.711
It's toxic in small doses.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.275
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.156
All right.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.033
-All right. So--
-Don't touch them.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.192
-You can get poisoned from beans?
-Yes.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.712
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.396
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

29:05.600 --> 29:07.591
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.076
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.509
But it-- It killed him?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.551
Oh, yes.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.040
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

29:21.240 --> 29:25.995
...and then no more Tuco.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.831
-Hey, Sky.
-Hey, Hank.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.992
How you doing?

30:10.200 --> 30:13.033
Is this.... This a bad time?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.550
No, come on in.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.875
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.631
What can I do for you?

30:34.280 --> 30:37.511
Maybe we ought--

30:37.720 --> 30:39.597
You wanna sit down first?

30:40.240 --> 30:41.275
I don't know, Hank.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.517
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.429
-Did she send you?
-Hell, no.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.108
She's barely even talking to me.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.072
That's why I'm here, okay?

30:56.280 --> 31:00.193
Self-preservation. Big time.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.918
Look...

31:05.480 --> 31:07.596
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.199
-I get it.
-Gals.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.551
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.555
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

31:18.120 --> 31:22.318
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

31:22.520 --> 31:26.229
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.716
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.115
Just call her back.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.756
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.919
That's right.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.877
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

31:47.080 --> 31:50.197
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.597
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

31:53.800 --> 31:58.078
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.069
Yeah.

32:00.280 --> 32:05.479
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know....

32:12.400 --> 32:13.515
You knew about this.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.909
We're working on it.

32:17.120 --> 32:20.078
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.078
-And I mean, Dave is really good.
-Dave's good, yeah.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.794
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

32:26.000 --> 32:29.515
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

32:29.720 --> 32:31.119
I mean, we gotta, you know.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.835
We gotta support the shit out of her.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.709
Do we?

32:37.920 --> 32:39.239
Yeah.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.273
I need support.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.153
Me.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.271
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

32:47.480 --> 32:49.198
...with the surprise baby on the way.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.478
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

32:51.680 --> 32:54.319
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.397
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.474
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.352
And the overdrawn
checking account.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.950
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

33:05.160 --> 33:07.754
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

33:07.960 --> 33:09.996
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.033
But, oh, I see.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.754
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

33:15.960 --> 33:18.349
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

33:18.560 --> 33:21.199
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

33:21.400 --> 33:24.198
...who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

33:24.400 --> 33:30.111
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.918
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

34:18.840 --> 34:20.592
That's all it takes?

34:21.920 --> 34:24.195
That's all it takes.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.753
So now what?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.960
Now we arrange our next meet.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.389
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.556
Business as usual.

34:35.760 --> 34:39.275
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.509
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

34:45.719 --> 34:46.789
Care to try it?"

34:48.000 --> 34:49.672
Okay, well, what's new about it?

34:50.840 --> 34:52.909
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.599
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

34:55.320 --> 34:58.153
It gets the user insanely high.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.669
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

35:00.880 --> 35:04.190
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

35:04.400 --> 35:07.437
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

35:08.360 --> 35:13.559
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

35:13.760 --> 35:16.228
...it'll look like natural causes.

35:16.440 --> 35:20.319
-What, like a heart attack?
-Yeah.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.351
Or the flu, maybe.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.279
His associates won't know
any differently...

35:26.000 --> 35:28.230
...and we'll be in the clear.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.273
Not if Tuco kills us first.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.876
Just keep it down.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.116
Hey, Hank. What's up?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.833
Oh, hey, buddy.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.629
You been home yet?

35:59.120 --> 36:01.350
No. Why?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.834
Well....

36:04.960 --> 36:06.279
Because I really screwed up.

36:06.480 --> 36:09.438
I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.279
I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.

36:12.480 --> 36:17.508
-I should have just kept out of it.
-Yeah, well, okay.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.233
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.955
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.628
Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

36:26.240 --> 36:28.629
Jesus, the wives, huh?

36:28.840 --> 36:31.115
Hank, unfortunately, I really--

36:31.320 --> 36:34.676
Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.

36:34.880 --> 36:39.510
Actually, I'm at work, so.... Oh, hey.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.358
You wanna see something
really freaky?

36:41.560 --> 36:44.711
-Well, I would, but--
-Seriously, Walt, this is....

36:45.880 --> 36:49.839
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.955
Hank.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.196
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

36:59.640 --> 37:03.428
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.951
Couple of local bulletheads.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.993
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.397
Walt, you there?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.073
Hey, Walt?

37:24.040 --> 37:26.600
-I'm taking this.
-No. It's my gun. I need it!

37:26.800 --> 37:29.268
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.472
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've....

37:32.680 --> 37:35.911
I've gotta get home. My family.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.311
Skyler?

38:22.960 --> 38:25.030
Walter, Jr.?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.031
Skyler?

39:16.360 --> 39:17.998
Hey.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.038
Where's Walter, Jr.?

39:21.240 --> 39:24.755
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

39:26.840 --> 39:31.118
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.113
So where have you been
this time?

39:44.080 --> 39:46.116
Walt?

39:58.840 --> 40:00.637
Walt?

40:16.320 --> 40:20.233
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

40:29.280 --> 40:31.077
Walt!

40:32.280 --> 40:34.555
I'll be right there.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.390
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.909
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

40:48.120 --> 40:49.314
...named Tuco Salamanca.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.954
-Guess he got tired of associating.
-Yeah.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.674
-Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
-No, go ahead.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.030
Thanks.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.469
The big one smells fresher.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.554
You guys find a death wound?

41:08.600 --> 41:13.071
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.873
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

41:18.040 --> 41:19.553
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.795
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

41:34.680 --> 41:35.999
Snap.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.919
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

41:48.360 --> 41:50.476
Oh, this is beautiful.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.351
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.198
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.709
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

41:57.920 --> 42:01.708
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

42:01.920 --> 42:05.117
...when the stack must have shifted.

42:05.320 --> 42:09.552
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.151
-Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
-Don't you just?

42:14.360 --> 42:16.396
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

42:16.600 --> 42:19.717
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

42:25.040 --> 42:29.352
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

42:36.800 --> 42:39.234
I don't know where to begin.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.193
What the hell are you doing here?

43:40.080 --> 43:41.069
Get in.

43:52.840 --> 43:55.593
Get in.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.837
Let's go.
