00:52.185 --> 00:55.348
-Check, please.
- Look, Daddy, a volcano.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.754
That's very pretty. Drink up your volcano.

00:57.791 --> 01:01.818
- All right, we're going. Mummy's waiting.
- Just one more minute?

01:02.963 --> 01:04.658
- We're going.
- No.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.029
- Yes.
- No.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.499
Yes.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.195
No.

01:10.303 --> 01:13.898
Until I ended up flatlining at the hospital.

01:14.708 --> 01:19.043
But I survived and, instead of letting that scare me,
I kept on going.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.614
Until my first daughter was born.

01:26.220 --> 01:30.623
And now, I look at my girls

01:30.658 --> 01:33.752
And my husband,

01:33.795 --> 01:38.255
Who has been standing by me for so long...

01:42.070 --> 01:44.095
Think which one you're gonna pull out.

01:44.139 --> 01:46.107
- I always think, man.
- No, you don't.

01:46.141 --> 01:49.235
They didn't lock you up because you're not 1 8.

01:49.278 --> 01:52.679
Next time, they're going to lock you up, brother.

01:52.714 --> 01:54.375
Come on.

02:03.692 --> 02:05.683
You're not thinking.

02:05.727 --> 02:09.527
Stealing might get you money,
get to tap some cheerleader's ass,

02:09.566 --> 02:12.535
Show off riding some pickle-colored Thunderbird.

02:14.070 --> 02:18.336
But what's gonna happen if you shoot
a pregnant woman or an old man?

02:21.511 --> 02:23.502
You know what will happen?

02:24.214 --> 02:26.648
The guilt will suck you down to the bone.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.261
Stealing ain't worth it.

02:41.298 --> 02:45.928
Going to church, reading the Bible
and believing in Jesus, brother -

02:45.970 --> 02:47.665
That's your ticket.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.707
Yeah.

02:54.378 --> 02:56.870
Think it's a fantasy, right?

02:57.749 --> 02:59.774
Huh?

03:01.653 --> 03:04.486
Come here, man. Get up, come here.

03:11.463 --> 03:14.364
- See that truck? Beauty, ain't it?

03:14.399 --> 03:17.163
- I won it at a friend's raffle.
- No shit.

03:17.202 --> 03:22.573
You know what? It wasn't luck.
It was Jesus who wanted me to have that truck.

03:22.608 --> 03:24.940
Bullshit. I bet you stole it.

03:26.412 --> 03:28.812
Jesus gave me that truck.

03:30.383 --> 03:33.978
And it's He who gives and He who takes away.

03:34.020 --> 03:37.786
- Yeah, right. He doesn't give a shit about us.
- Come back.

03:37.823 --> 03:39.814
Come back!

03:44.463 --> 03:46.455
Take off the hat.

03:46.967 --> 03:49.094
Take off that hat.

03:51.972 --> 03:55.066
God even knows
when a single hair moves on your head.

03:58.345 --> 04:00.336
You're wrong, Nick.

04:26.341 --> 04:30.300
'So, this is death's waiting room.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.277
'These ridiculous tubes.

04:36.618 --> 04:39.485
'These needles swelling my arms.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.957
'What am I doing in this pre-corpse club?

04:49.431 --> 04:51.899
'What do I have to do with them?

04:56.271 --> 04:59.297
'l don't know when anything began anymore.

05:00.010 --> 05:02.308
'Or when it's gonna end.

05:05.181 --> 05:08.082
'Who will be the first to lose his life?

05:10.587 --> 05:13.454
'He, in the coma?

05:19.529 --> 05:21.520
'Or me?'

06:04.342 --> 06:07.778
All right. You can get dressed now.

06:07.813 --> 06:11.340
Your fallopian tubes are severely damaged.

06:11.383 --> 06:14.945
It, er, looks like you had some kind of infection

06:14.987 --> 06:17.979
That wasn't taken care of properly.

06:18.024 --> 06:23.587
We can try surgery but I have to tell you,
I think the probabilities are pretty slim.

06:25.331 --> 06:27.697
Look,

06:27.733 --> 06:32.432
Excuse me for asking this
but it's important that you tell me the truth.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.906
Have you ever had an abortion?

06:41.648 --> 06:44.515
- Yes.
- Any reason?

06:46.386 --> 06:50.516
I had already separated from my husband
when I got pregnant...

06:50.557 --> 06:52.991
No, I meant medical reason.

06:56.697 --> 06:59.860
- My husband's dying.
- I'm sorry?

06:59.900 --> 07:02.061
Paul, my husband, he's dying.

07:02.102 --> 07:04.333
And I want to have his baby.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.675
We can operate then and hope you get pregnant
within three or four months.

07:13.615 --> 07:16.880
He's got one month left, at most.

07:22.157 --> 07:24.557
- How did it go?
- Not good, Reverend.

07:24.592 --> 07:28.256
- In one ear and out the other.
- Be patient.

07:28.297 --> 07:34.065
- All it takes is one sheep in 1,000, Jack.
- Wolf, you still having that party Wednesday?

07:34.103 --> 07:36.128
- My place, brother.
- Cool.

07:38.174 --> 07:40.642
I may be late. I have Bible class Wednesday.

07:40.676 --> 07:43.270
- Let it go.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

07:43.312 --> 07:45.610
- Here, hold this.
-

07:45.648 --> 07:47.616
- I will hurt you, boy!
- Paul.

07:47.650 --> 07:50.380
-.. Motherfucking dead!
- Back off. Back.

07:50.419 --> 07:53.082
- I told you to think.
- Fuck you.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.985
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me, eh?

07:57.027 --> 07:59.791
Jack! Jack! Jack! Hey! Hey!

07:59.829 --> 08:01.797
Come on, come on.

08:02.132 --> 08:04.396
Leave it, Jack.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.199
He's a kid, Jack.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.603
- He's a punk, Reverend.
- No, he's a kid.

08:11.274 --> 08:13.606
You think, Jack. You think.

08:22.720 --> 08:26.588
'For those who are
making decisions that affect our life

08:26.624 --> 08:29.787
'we must call out to God
to give them His wisdom...'

08:29.827 --> 08:34.890
Daddy's home. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll pick the boys up after school if you want.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.128
-
- Daddy!

08:38.169 --> 08:39.466
Hello.

08:41.639 --> 08:43.471
How's my queen?

08:44.042 --> 08:46.476
- And Hercules?
- You don't have a queen.

08:46.511 --> 08:49.878
Help me. I got the cooler from the religious center.

08:49.915 --> 08:53.544
- Are we gonna go buy a dog now?
- We agreed, no dogs.

08:53.585 --> 08:57.146
- You said if I got good grades...
- We've been through this,

08:57.189 --> 09:02.286
- dog hair is bad for your sister's allergies.
- It's not bad for me. Get me a dog.

09:02.327 --> 09:06.320
- Freddy, leave it alone.
- At least get me a hamster.

09:06.866 --> 09:11.530
- We'll see.
- We'll see? You always say you promise.

09:38.532 --> 09:41.933
Hey, Wolf! Are you back, motherfucker?

09:41.969 --> 09:44.062
Lock down six!

09:45.973 --> 09:48.203
Six down!

10:07.095 --> 10:09.563
- I win.
- Age before beauty.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.762
Such a sore loser.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.236
- Do you want to go to the Jacuzzi for a while?
- I can't.

10:23.279 --> 10:26.612
- Michael and the girls are waiting for me.
- OK.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.875
- Call me later.
- I'll call you.

10:32.355 --> 10:34.050
Cristina?

10:36.692 --> 10:41.686
If you get away from leading your family
like a man of God ought to lead his family -

10:41.731 --> 10:44.757
In prayer and reading the word of God

10:45.234 --> 10:49.001
And the things of God
and bringing them to the house of God -

10:49.039 --> 10:52.805
Then you're opening a door for the devil to come in
and slay your family.

10:52.843 --> 10:54.242
Amen.

10:54.277 --> 10:56.939
- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light.

10:56.980 --> 10:59.642
- Jesus is our hope.
- Jesus is our hope.

10:59.683 --> 11:03.380
- Jesus is our forgiveness.
- Jesus is our forgiveness.

11:03.420 --> 11:09.188
- Jesus is the water that quenches my thirst.
- Jesus is the water that quenches my thirst.

11:09.226 --> 11:13.391
- If you're saved and you know it, say amen.
- Amen!

11:13.431 --> 11:15.729
Everybody up on your feet!

11:17.368 --> 11:20.826
- Jesus is our light.
- Jesus is our light.

13:02.611 --> 13:05.307
-
- Hey, honey, I'm home.

13:26.903 --> 13:29.371
- Hi.
- Jesus, you scared me.

13:29.405 --> 13:31.236
How are you feeling?

13:31.274 --> 13:34.334
- I feel great.
- Have you been smoking again?

13:35.711 --> 13:37.838
For fuck's sake, Paul.

13:38.381 --> 13:41.943
If they find out they'll take you off the transplant list.

13:41.985 --> 13:44.180
If I don't smoke I go fucking nuts.

13:44.221 --> 13:46.052
Better nuts than dead.

13:47.257 --> 13:49.225
Not necessarily.

13:49.259 --> 13:51.659
I don't know how the hell you get them.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.362
Baby, baby...

13:58.402 --> 14:02.236
Baby, baby.

14:02.272 --> 14:06.972
Oh, God! Call an ambulance.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.473
Call a fucking ambulance!

14:12.784 --> 14:14.615
Goddamnit.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.713
Please do something.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.631
Come on. Please.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.905
- Whoops.
- Can you handle your clubs?

15:08.942 --> 15:12.935
Jack, the boss wants to talk to you.
Wants to see you now.

15:13.380 --> 15:17.214
Come on, we both know I'm not a caddy yet.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.881
But I'm working at it. And I'm learning, Brown.

15:23.591 --> 15:28.028
- I swear to God, I'm not going to let you down.
- That's not the problem.

15:28.963 --> 15:33.366
- What's the problem?
- There have been complaints about your tattoos.

15:33.401 --> 15:38.771
- I got a long-sleeved shirt.
- No shirt gonna cover the one on your neck.

15:38.806 --> 15:41.297
Or are you gonna start wearing a scarf?

15:45.514 --> 15:48.142
This club is for people different from me and you...

15:48.183 --> 15:51.448
No, no, no. You know, I don't drink, I don't steal.

15:51.486 --> 15:56.150
- I'm clean. Tell me, why me?
- I know you're clean, that's why I hired you.

15:56.191 --> 15:58.955
But this decision is from the administration

15:58.994 --> 16:03.055
And if I don't follow through with it,
they're gonna fuck me too.

16:07.336 --> 16:12.603
I cut you a hefty severance check,
you can pick it up on the way to the cashier's.

16:13.042 --> 16:14.976
Try to understand.

16:51.482 --> 16:55.475
OK, good. So, is there any pain?

16:55.519 --> 17:00.116
- My head hurts a bit.
- That's the blood pressure medicine.

17:00.158 --> 17:03.924
- We'll get you something to make you feel better.
- Thank you.

17:03.962 --> 17:06.988
I brought what you asked for.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.329
Oh, my God.

17:11.435 --> 17:13.529
Oh!

17:13.570 --> 17:15.903
Is that my heart?

17:22.214 --> 17:24.204
The culprit.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.363
Which one is he?

17:45.638 --> 17:47.869
That's him with the brown vest.

17:47.908 --> 17:50.433
He's putting the bag up on the top right now.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.451
You OK?

18:22.510 --> 18:24.569
I want to kill him.

18:25.613 --> 18:27.945
We have to kill him.

18:32.119 --> 18:36.523
Thank you Lord for keeping us together,
for filling us with love

18:36.558 --> 18:39.118
And for giving us this meal. Amen.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.924
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:48.370 --> 18:51.203
I got fired from the club today.

18:55.143 --> 18:59.671
- Cos of your good pal Brown, right?
- He had nothing to do with it.

18:59.715 --> 19:02.685
- You believe that, Jack?
- Yes, I do.

19:04.053 --> 19:06.647
- Freddy, stop it.
- He hit me in the arm.

19:06.689 --> 19:09.385
- Which arm, baby?
- This one.

19:09.425 --> 19:12.519
Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you.

19:15.565 --> 19:17.328
- Give me that.
- Jack, no!

19:17.367 --> 19:18.994
Hold it out.

19:19.469 --> 19:22.267
"Whoever slaps you on the right cheek,

19:22.305 --> 19:24.900
"turn the other to him also."

19:26.577 --> 19:28.977
- Hit her. Don't be afraid.
- Jack!

19:29.013 --> 19:30.981
Hit her!

19:34.585 --> 19:37.679
Isn't that great? Wonderful. Great parenting.

19:37.721 --> 19:39.848
Good job. It's OK.

19:39.890 --> 19:42.256
He didn't hurt her.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.599
There's no hitting in this house.

19:59.644 --> 20:02.738
You understand? Get in the corner.

20:13.658 --> 20:18.596
- Do I put the chocolate chips in now, Mommy?
- That's right, and then stir.

20:20.866 --> 20:22.663
Stir real quick.

20:22.702 --> 20:25.034
Laura, put that back. Come on.

20:25.805 --> 20:29.002
- When's Daddy coming?
- Soon. Let's get this finished.

20:30.743 --> 20:32.233
Mm.

20:32.745 --> 20:34.076
Mm!

20:34.113 --> 20:38.447
-
- No, Laura, stop it now.

20:38.884 --> 20:41.217
Ask Lupe to stay next Friday.

20:41.254 --> 20:44.621
I've invited the company managers over for dinner.

20:44.658 --> 20:46.819
I fired her.

20:46.860 --> 20:49.454
You fired her? Why?

20:51.231 --> 20:53.597
She made me feel like a cripple.

20:53.633 --> 20:55.897
Goddamnit, Paul.

20:56.403 --> 20:58.701
So now who's going to cook for you?

20:58.739 --> 21:02.368
Who's going to clean up after you,
take care of you? Who?

21:02.409 --> 21:05.902
- I can do it for myself.
- Oh, you can do it by yourself?

21:07.882 --> 21:10.180
I can't do it anymore, Paul.

21:10.218 --> 21:12.345
Really, I can't.

21:30.139 --> 21:35.372
- What are you doing?
- I'm just... What does it feel like I'm doing?

21:36.211 --> 21:39.078
- Don't. You might hurt yourself.
- I won't.

21:39.114 --> 21:41.742
Besides, I need you to...

21:43.085 --> 21:47.215
- I went to a fertility clinic.
- Oh, good, more doctors.

21:47.256 --> 21:52.091
- Mary, I can't have this discussion again.
- No, this is a specialist.

21:52.127 --> 21:56.462
He said that with surgery I might get pregnant.
You need to donate sperm...

21:56.499 --> 21:59.024
- No.
- I could take care of him.

21:59.069 --> 22:02.527
But I can't. So what's the point?

22:04.474 --> 22:07.136
This is what I most want in the world.

22:07.644 --> 22:09.771
Do it for me, please.

23:06.037 --> 23:08.529
This will be 58.95.

23:17.350 --> 23:19.011
Thank you.

23:26.993 --> 23:30.326
Did you find everything you need, sir?

23:30.363 --> 23:32.525
I'll have...

23:32.566 --> 23:35.763
Oh, you know what? I left my wallet.

23:59.394 --> 24:02.022
- It's gonna be hot.
- Great.

24:03.665 --> 24:08.193
- When does my brother plan to show up?
- He said he'd be back by six.

24:13.308 --> 24:16.471
1 00% pure golden lager.

24:17.212 --> 24:19.305
Are you out of your mind?

24:20.548 --> 24:24.315
- Oh, it's warm.
- If you want to drink lemonade all night...

24:31.827 --> 24:33.954
Katie? Laura?

24:35.931 --> 24:37.922
Where are you guys?

24:53.183 --> 24:56.277
'To repeat the message, press one. To delete it...'

24:56.319 --> 25:01.882
'Hi, it's Dad. I was hoping we could have lunch
one day next week. Give me a call.'

25:01.925 --> 25:06.055
'Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...'

25:06.096 --> 25:09.725
-
- 'Girls, no. Laura, stop it.

25:09.766 --> 25:13.760
'Give me a call on my cell. I'll see you in a bit. Bye.'

25:13.804 --> 25:16.238
'To save the message, press...'

25:30.254 --> 25:32.085
Hello.

25:34.225 --> 25:36.558
Speaking.

25:45.971 --> 25:48.633
What?

25:52.878 --> 25:54.846
Where?

26:41.929 --> 26:45.092
Stay here. I'll be right back.

26:51.973 --> 26:56.103
You understand that even
if the operation is successful

26:56.144 --> 27:01.241
- artificial insemination doesn't always work.
- It doesn't matter. We want to try.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.413
Paul?

27:06.721 --> 27:08.211
Yeah.

27:13.161 --> 27:15.221
Now, Paul, um...

27:16.265 --> 27:18.961
This is about having a child

27:19.001 --> 27:24.735
And, with your condition,
you know you probably won't ever meet him.

27:27.643 --> 27:29.770
Life goes on, right?

27:32.181 --> 27:37.141
I'd like you to put on one of these gloves
to avoid contaminating the sample.

27:37.186 --> 27:41.055
And try to make it all land in the receptacle.

27:42.492 --> 27:44.858
When you're done, just leave it in here.

27:47.597 --> 27:50.589
In case you need a little inspiration.

27:58.408 --> 28:00.933
'Hey, big boy, how are you doing?

28:00.977 --> 28:05.745
- 'Oh, yeah, are you ready to party?'
- 'Yeah, well, I'm here now.'

28:08.853 --> 28:11.981
'Oh, yeah! Yeah!

28:12.023 --> 28:14.014
'Oh! Oh, God!

28:15.059 --> 28:18.028
'Mm! I'm gonna come really quick!

28:18.062 --> 28:19.393
'Oh!'

28:33.912 --> 28:38.076
- 'Dr Swann, call the operator.'
-

28:38.116 --> 28:42.177
Excuse me, my husband and daughters
were in an accident.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.850
- What were their names?
- Michael, Katherine and Laura Peck.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.325
OK.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.596
Excuse me for a minute.

28:56.002 --> 28:58.596
- Cris?
- What happened, sweetheart?

28:58.638 --> 29:01.368
I don't know, they haven't told me yet.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.706
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yeah, don't worry.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.015
What is the most important question for safe sex?

29:15.722 --> 29:17.815
What time does your husband get home?

29:19.693 --> 29:22.093
That's good, huh?

29:28.035 --> 29:30.333
His Highness has arrived.

29:35.476 --> 29:38.377
Let's see what he comes up with.

29:40.848 --> 29:42.873
Serve up that chili.

29:49.391 --> 29:52.827
It's seven o'clock.
What are you gonna make up this time - traffic?

29:52.861 --> 29:57.662
You were preaching the word?
The entire congregation's been waiting for you.

29:57.699 --> 30:00.259
It's your party, remember?

30:00.302 --> 30:02.395
What's wrong?

30:05.140 --> 30:07.131
Have you been drinking?

30:08.978 --> 30:11.412
You didn't drink again, did you?

30:12.915 --> 30:15.713
I just ran over a man and two girls.

30:19.589 --> 30:21.955
You're lying, right?

30:29.565 --> 30:31.863
I was driving home...

30:33.236 --> 30:35.227
Took a turn...

30:37.307 --> 30:39.002
A little too quickly,

30:39.042 --> 30:41.010
Didn't see them crossing.

31:09.841 --> 31:12.435
Can't you go any faster?

31:16.047 --> 31:18.413
Oh...

31:27.893 --> 31:30.054
I love you.

31:36.435 --> 31:38.926
Deep breath.

31:41.106 --> 31:43.768
Good. Your lungs are clear.

31:43.809 --> 31:45.709
I have a question for you.

31:45.744 --> 31:47.770
Whose heart do I have?

31:48.682 --> 31:51.981
I can't tell you, it's hospital regulations.

31:52.018 --> 31:56.717
- The donor's family doesn't know you either.
- But you know?

31:56.756 --> 31:58.724
Yes.

31:58.758 --> 32:03.957
- This is your heart, that's all that should matter.
- I want to know who saved my life.

32:03.997 --> 32:07.728
You could write an anonymous letter
through the Donors' Association.

32:07.767 --> 32:10.793
Personally, I think it's better that you don't know.

32:26.287 --> 32:30.348
- Mrs. Peck? Dr. Jones.
- What happened to my family?

32:30.391 --> 32:33.622
- Please sit down.
- No, I'm OK.

32:33.661 --> 32:37.189
- What happened?
- Your husband and daughters were hit by a car.

32:37.232 --> 32:40.326
We had to perform emergency surgery
on your husband.

32:40.368 --> 32:43.337
Your husband suffered multiple skull fractures

32:43.371 --> 32:47.171
And we had to remove blood clots
from around the brain.

32:47.209 --> 32:51.737
He's critical and we're concerned
that he's showing low brain activity.

32:53.882 --> 32:56.578
Is he gonna be all right?

32:57.018 --> 32:59.213
We're doing the best we can.

32:59.254 --> 33:01.450
And what about my daughters?

33:07.597 --> 33:11.693
Your youngest daughter was brought in
with severe bleeding.

33:11.734 --> 33:14.498
She just wasn't able to get here in time.

33:15.304 --> 33:17.295
I'm very sorry. They...

33:18.241 --> 33:20.300
They both died in the accident.

33:21.444 --> 33:23.935
No.

33:25.281 --> 33:28.683
No...

33:31.655 --> 33:34.180
Oh, my God!

33:35.559 --> 33:37.686
No! Oh, my God!

33:44.401 --> 33:46.369
Where are they?!

33:48.172 --> 33:50.403
Where... Where are they?

33:51.609 --> 33:55.773
Mrs. Peck, your girls are here
and you can see them if you like.

33:55.814 --> 34:00.649
I wanna see them.
I wouldn't recommend it.

34:00.685 --> 34:03.313
Oh, God, Daddy.

34:03.354 --> 34:08.018
I'm very sorry. If you'll excuse us,
we have to get back to Mr. Peck.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.121
I'm very sorry.

34:16.936 --> 34:19.460
Oh, God... Oh...

34:20.873 --> 34:22.568
Oh, God.

34:23.475 --> 34:28.139
- We want dinner!
- Marianne, we'd like some dinner in here.

34:30.583 --> 34:35.452
Tell Reverend John to stay, make sure
no one notices and get everyone to leave.

34:35.487 --> 34:38.752
- What happened?
- Trish, just do what I tell you.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.489
It's going to be OK.

34:43.362 --> 34:45.126
It's all gonna be OK.

34:46.366 --> 34:52.498
- Start the truck up, pull it in. Come on, baby.
-

35:30.612 --> 35:32.409
Hey, Jack!

35:34.216 --> 35:36.207
What are you doing here, man?

35:37.219 --> 35:39.585
Just came to pick up my things, Brown.

35:50.198 --> 35:54.192
- Why don't you let me buy you a couple of beers?
- I don't drink.

35:54.237 --> 35:56.137
How about a Diet Coke?

35:56.739 --> 36:00.573
I've been talking to a buddy
about hooking you up with a job,

36:00.610 --> 36:02.942
I've been telling him all about you.

36:05.148 --> 36:09.016
So what do you say?
I've been feeling shitty about what went down.

36:09.052 --> 36:11.043
I understand.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.020
So what do you say?

36:13.056 --> 36:17.925
As you know the doctors did everything they could
to save your husband's life

36:17.961 --> 36:20.760
But he has shown no brain activity.

36:21.765 --> 36:27.397
We're here to help you with
some of the final decisions that need to be made.

36:27.438 --> 36:30.601
We have a patient who is gravely ill.

36:31.408 --> 36:35.367
I'm here to give you some information
on organ donation.

36:36.580 --> 36:39.572
Are you willing for your husband
to donate his heart?

36:39.616 --> 36:42.346
- Can we discuss this another time?
- I'm afraid not.

36:42.386 --> 36:46.221
You can discuss it
but this is a decision that needs to be made soon.

36:46.257 --> 36:48.350
-
- Paul?

36:49.928 --> 36:51.953
Paul, the beeper.

37:00.438 --> 37:03.498
It's the hospital. I think they've got a heart.

37:10.049 --> 37:14.315
Hello? Yes, I'm calling on behalf of
Mr. Paul Rivers.

37:15.388 --> 37:16.855
Yes.

37:18.290 --> 37:20.281
OK. Yes, I understand.

37:20.993 --> 37:22.961
Where do I have to take him?

37:52.659 --> 37:54.354
Good luck, my love.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.624
Hello.

39:07.270 --> 39:08.760
Hello.

39:11.407 --> 39:14.536
- Does your shoulder bother you?
- Why?

39:14.578 --> 39:18.207
I was watching you swim before
and you have a wide stroke.

39:18.249 --> 39:21.218
If you bring it in tighter you get a better glide.

39:24.221 --> 39:26.689
Thanks for the advice.

39:32.396 --> 39:35.763
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Actually, I was just leaving.

39:36.902 --> 39:38.893
There you go.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.133
Maybe just until you finish?

39:44.176 --> 39:46.406
No, maybe next time.

39:55.187 --> 40:00.784
Did you know that eating alone
can cause kidney damage? And that's bad.

40:05.932 --> 40:07.661
All right. Sorry.

40:37.998 --> 40:39.989
'Hello?'

40:40.867 --> 40:43.097
Hello. Is Ana there?

40:43.136 --> 40:45.127
- What?
-

40:45.172 --> 40:47.663
- 'ls Ana there?'
- Hold on a sec. Ana?

40:48.609 --> 40:49.940
Ana!

40:49.977 --> 40:51.809
Phone call.

40:52.947 --> 40:54.778
Hello.

40:57.051 --> 40:58.848
'Hello?

41:01.489 --> 41:03.047
'Who is that?'

41:13.601 --> 41:17.868
Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...

41:17.906 --> 41:21.364
Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.

41:22.211 --> 41:25.578
Give me a call on my cell. See you in a bit. Bye.

41:53.877 --> 41:55.868
Did you go?

42:01.418 --> 42:03.113
Are they dead?

42:10.928 --> 42:13.260
I'm gonna turn myself in.

42:13.297 --> 42:16.266
John says nobody saw you, nobody.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.565
They don't know the license plate
or what kind of car...

42:19.603 --> 42:22.538
What would you do if these were our children?

42:22.573 --> 42:26.202
- Tell me.
- They're not. It didn't happen to us.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.039
No, it didn't happen to us.

42:33.352 --> 42:35.684
It happened to me.

42:49.935 --> 42:53.098
What the fuck do you gain by turning yourself in?

42:53.138 --> 42:58.441
- It's my duty, Marianne.
- No, Jack, your duty is here with us,

42:59.045 --> 43:01.036
Your family.

43:02.882 --> 43:06.113
- My duty is to God.
- Please.

43:06.152 --> 43:08.985
Marianne,

43:09.021 --> 43:10.682
Get out of my way.

43:12.592 --> 43:14.389
Jack!

44:09.418 --> 44:12.649
-
- Oh, buddy! Right there.

44:13.189 --> 44:15.020
My turn.

44:16.325 --> 44:18.657
I think I better go back to the hospital.

44:22.798 --> 44:26.097
- He deserves it.
- I thought you're not supposed to eat that.

44:26.135 --> 44:30.094
- I'm making up for lost time.
- Lost time not lost pounds.

44:30.139 --> 44:32.733
We're gonna send you back for liposuction.

44:32.775 --> 44:37.543
Well, here's to all those...
who didn't think I was gonna die.

44:37.948 --> 44:40.178
Hear! Hear!

44:40.217 --> 44:42.276
And to the first day of my new life.

44:42.319 --> 44:46.688
It's good to have you home.
Knew you'd make it.

44:46.723 --> 44:48.554
He's so wonderful.

44:48.592 --> 44:51.060
I also have an announcement to make.

44:51.094 --> 44:55.929
I wanted to tell you that Paul and l
are going to be parents.

44:55.966 --> 44:59.698
- That's great!
- There's a scary thought, Paul being a parent.

45:00.171 --> 45:03.163
- You kept this quiet.
- Have you told your folks?

45:03.207 --> 45:06.370
We're going to be parents,
we don't know when yet.

45:06.410 --> 45:11.370
I'm going to have an operation
and then try artificial insemination.

45:11.415 --> 45:14.714
Terrific.
Artificial insemination?

45:14.752 --> 45:18.381
Do your female students know
you no longer have lead in your pencil?

45:18.422 --> 45:22.484
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh!

45:22.528 --> 45:24.723
Play nice.

45:25.364 --> 45:30.563
Come on, let's pass the cake around.
Cut me a piece about half that size.

45:30.602 --> 45:32.467
I can't wait to hear about this.

45:48.821 --> 45:51.312
- Mr. Donneaud?
- Mr. Rivers?

45:52.158 --> 45:53.819
Thanks for coming.

45:53.860 --> 45:58.797
Sorry I couldn't cancel my bowling
but the way I'm bowling I probably should have.

45:58.831 --> 46:00.526
Park it right there.

46:40.709 --> 46:44.042
- Can I bring you something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

46:44.079 --> 46:47.276
- Honey, you need to eat something.
- I'm fine, Dad.

46:51.119 --> 46:54.577
When your mother died
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

46:55.724 --> 47:00.218
I felt that the world was falling on me
and I was never going to get up.

47:01.296 --> 47:05.233
But, sweetie, life goes on.

47:09.305 --> 47:11.637
You know what I thought when Mom died?

47:14.744 --> 47:19.477
I couldn't understand how
you could talk to people again.

47:21.183 --> 47:23.777
How you could laugh...

47:23.819 --> 47:25.980
Again.

47:27.024 --> 47:30.016
I couldn't understand how you could play with us.

47:32.796 --> 47:36.254
And no. No, that's a lie.

47:38.368 --> 47:40.962
Life does not just go on.

47:51.716 --> 47:58.280
Louise is getting fat, don't you think?
She's done nothing but eat since Robert left her.

47:59.357 --> 48:01.552
What, she looks OK to you?

48:02.393 --> 48:06.193
Why did you tell everybody we're having a baby?

48:06.230 --> 48:08.164
I wanted to share our plans with them.

48:08.199 --> 48:09.757
Oh.

48:11.069 --> 48:15.403
That's what I mean. Why does everyone
have to know our private life?

48:15.440 --> 48:17.739
Why the fuss? They're our best friends.

48:18.777 --> 48:21.678
But we haven't even talked about it.

48:21.714 --> 48:26.413
- Oh, we haven't? I thought this was settled.
- Things change, Mary.

48:28.654 --> 48:33.182
- It's something we have to think about.
- I don't have anything to think about.

48:33.225 --> 48:35.887
I've already made my decision.

48:40.232 --> 48:42.201
Would you help me with the glasses?

48:53.880 --> 48:58.476
Do you want me to stay tonight?
I'm OK, thanks.

49:02.555 --> 49:04.853
I just want to be alone.

49:15.269 --> 49:17.260
Cris...

49:19.840 --> 49:21.831
The police called.

49:23.210 --> 49:27.271
They said you need to go and press charges.

49:27.314 --> 49:29.305
I'll go with you if you want.

49:30.118 --> 49:32.279
I'm not going to do anything.

49:35.590 --> 49:39.048
This guy was... was some ex-con.

49:39.094 --> 49:41.392
Are you going to let him walk the streets?

49:41.429 --> 49:45.661
- What do you want me to do?
- He ran over Michael and your daughters...

49:45.700 --> 49:50.797
Nothing I can do is going to bring them back.
Do you get that?

50:01.284 --> 50:03.514
Hey, how are you doing?

50:03.553 --> 50:06.147
- You found it OK?
- Yeah, I did.

50:07.156 --> 50:10.990
The donor's name was Michael Peck.
He was 37 years old.

50:11.027 --> 50:13.120
An architect and married.

50:13.162 --> 50:17.690
This is the transplant authorization
signed by his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.

50:17.733 --> 50:21.033
I have a copy of the medical report
if you'd care to see it

50:21.071 --> 50:25.838
And I also have the widow's phone number
and address if you're interested.

50:25.876 --> 50:28.436
How did Michael Peck die?

50:30.380 --> 50:32.848
You might have seen it in the newspaper.

50:33.917 --> 50:38.616
This guy named Jack Jordan
ran over Mr. Peck and his two little girls,

50:38.655 --> 50:40.646
October 1 0th, 6:50pm.

50:40.691 --> 50:45.459
This Jack Jordan's a piece of work.
He's been in and out of jails since he was 1 6.

50:45.496 --> 50:50.399
Car thief, small-time crook,
drugs, bad checks, alcoholism.

50:52.036 --> 50:55.301
Last time he was in jail was only two years ago.

50:59.510 --> 51:01.637
You feeling OK, Mr. Rivers?

51:04.148 --> 51:06.139
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

51:07.185 --> 51:09.552
- I just...
- You want some water?

51:12.758 --> 51:17.752
- He was an architect.
- What's the point in getting involved?

51:20.733 --> 51:23.031
Mary, I want to know who I am now.

51:24.637 --> 51:26.935
I don't think that's the way to do it.

51:28.173 --> 51:30.164
What is, then?

51:33.178 --> 51:35.477
Look for it with me.

51:36.950 --> 51:39.976
Let's look ahead together, not behind.

51:53.233 --> 51:58.194
Not drinking on your birthday?
Come over to my place, I'm having a party.

51:58.239 --> 52:02.175
I bet they're all as boring as you.
You'd be surprised.

52:02.209 --> 52:05.872
- I'll pass. I call you later about that job.
- All right.

52:06.914 --> 52:08.575
Thank you.

52:12.153 --> 52:14.713
Hey, Brown, you should.

52:14.755 --> 52:16.746
I will.

52:48.958 --> 52:54.294
We can schedule the surgery.
Erm... I could get you in as early as Monday.

52:57.166 --> 52:58.497
Yeah.

52:58.534 --> 53:00.434
9am?

53:00.470 --> 53:03.564
What's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?

53:03.606 --> 53:10.205
I can't offer you a real number on that.
There's the abortion that wasn't handled properly...

53:10.246 --> 53:12.374
What abortion?

53:13.917 --> 53:16.078
What abortion, Mary?

53:16.487 --> 53:18.614
I can explain.

53:18.655 --> 53:21.419
- Explain what?
- There is an explanation.

53:21.458 --> 53:25.827
Uh-huh. All that drama
about artificial insemination,

53:25.863 --> 53:30.596
Kids' names, we got pictures
of our friends' babies all over the place.

53:30.634 --> 53:33.797
Why? So you can flush it down the fucking toilet?

53:37.008 --> 53:40.273
We've been a fraud for a long time, Mary.

53:40.311 --> 53:43.474
Oh, yeah? Why didn't you tell me that
when you were sick?

53:43.515 --> 53:46.848
Or did you expect one of your girlfriends
to take care of you?

53:46.885 --> 53:50.218
You came back because
you wanted to, don't blame me.

53:50.255 --> 53:54.157
- I came back because I love you.
- Or because you were lonely.

54:08.874 --> 54:10.774
I'm sorry.

54:11.811 --> 54:13.711
I'm sorry.

54:14.613 --> 54:17.309
We can't keep going like this.

54:17.349 --> 54:19.544
The insemination, the child.

54:20.553 --> 54:25.388
It's like we're trying to put a Band-Aid
on something that's been bled dry.

54:26.460 --> 54:28.325
It's finished.

54:28.895 --> 54:30.556
Finished?

54:30.597 --> 54:34.590
It isn't finished if we give it a chance
and have this baby.

54:35.102 --> 54:39.198
- When we could have, you didn't want to.
- We were separated, goddamnit!

54:39.239 --> 54:41.639
- It's different now.
- Yes.

54:41.675 --> 54:44.166
- It's different.
-

54:44.211 --> 54:47.908
- Ready to go?
- You only know how to think about yourself.

54:55.623 --> 54:57.818
Close six.

55:02.230 --> 55:04.357
Thanks for finally seeing me.

55:07.635 --> 55:10.001
They tell me you don't want to eat.

55:10.671 --> 55:12.662
I'm not hungry.

55:14.709 --> 55:16.610
Jack...

55:16.645 --> 55:19.773
Jesus didn't come to free us from pain.

55:19.815 --> 55:23.080
He came to give us the strength to bear it.

55:23.118 --> 55:26.918
- Maybe He wanted this pain for me.
- No, this was an accident.

55:26.955 --> 55:29.082
No, it wasn't an accident.

55:29.124 --> 55:31.422
Jesus chose me for this.

55:33.328 --> 55:35.853
Jack...

55:35.898 --> 55:38.059
Ask for the mercy of Jesus Christ.

55:39.868 --> 55:44.203
If it was an accident,
why do I have to ask for His mercy?

55:44.741 --> 55:49.838
"l will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,
compassion on whom I will have compassion."

55:49.879 --> 55:54.077
- Don't be so prideful, it's a sin.
- ".. the fearful, the unbelieving..."

55:54.117 --> 55:57.746
- Jack, listen to me.
- ".. murderers, warmongers, idolaters,

55:57.787 --> 56:01.086
- "and all liars have their part in the lake..."
- Jesus came to save us not to damn us.

56:01.124 --> 56:04.582
".. which burneth with fire and brimstone."
Revelation 21 :8.

56:04.627 --> 56:08.792
Jesus loves you but He also knows
how to punish arrogant sinners like you.

56:08.832 --> 56:13.132
"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten."
Revelation 3: 1 9.

56:13.170 --> 56:16.936
- Jesus betrayed me.
- Stop this shit or you're going to Hell.

56:16.974 --> 56:19.238
Hell?

56:19.276 --> 56:21.141
This is Hell.

56:21.178 --> 56:23.840
- Right here.
- You're damning your soul.

56:23.881 --> 56:26.543
- Ask Christ for forgiveness.
- Forgive me?

56:26.584 --> 56:29.781
I did everything He asked me to do. I changed.

56:29.820 --> 56:33.313
I gave Him my life and He betrayed me.

56:33.358 --> 56:38.921
He put that fucking truck in my hands,
made me do His will and kill those people

56:38.964 --> 56:41.626
But He didn't give me
the strength to save them.

56:41.666 --> 56:45.864
Don't blaspheme, you bastard!
Christ had nothing to do with this.

56:47.839 --> 56:51.036
God even knows when a single hair
moves on your head.

56:53.178 --> 56:55.511
And you taught me that.

56:57.950 --> 57:00.282
We're gonna pray for you, Jack.

58:10.225 --> 58:12.716
Just like old times. How have you been?

58:13.862 --> 58:17.263
Did you end up marrying that hunk
you brought here last time?

58:17.299 --> 58:20.029
- Yep.
- Yeah?

58:20.069 --> 58:23.732
Is he a good lay? How they make us suffer, huh?

58:23.772 --> 58:26.866
It's all right, I got some great candy for you.

58:26.909 --> 58:31.005
Got Special K, angel dust
and your all-time favorite.

58:31.814 --> 58:36.309
And I got the newest of the new - R2.

58:36.353 --> 58:40.915
This shit's all the rage. You take two of these,
you go straight to heaven.

58:40.957 --> 58:45.656
- I'm not into chemicals.
- You're not a cuddly little kittie now, are you?

58:46.296 --> 58:49.060
If you don't like 'em, you don't pay for 'em.

58:53.636 --> 58:55.661
- That's my girl.
-

58:55.705 --> 58:58.299
It's busy.

59:01.612 --> 59:04.342
Hey, go easy on the booze tonight, right?

59:33.678 --> 59:36.203
- What the fuck are you...?
-

59:40.919 --> 59:43.251
What the fuck are you doing?

01:00:00.406 --> 01:00:02.135
Would you get my car, please?

01:00:02.175 --> 01:00:06.168
What do you care? I don't need a fucking taxi.

01:00:06.212 --> 01:00:07.873
There's your fucking glass.

01:00:12.218 --> 01:00:17.282
Stupid fucking asshole, move your car!
I'm fine! Get away from my car!

01:00:17.324 --> 01:00:20.157
There's no damage, OK? There's no damage.

01:00:20.194 --> 01:00:22.219
I know her, I can drive her home.

01:00:22.262 --> 01:00:26.892
- Is this any of your business?
- I'm your friend Paul, from the sports club.

01:00:27.734 --> 01:00:29.964
- Yeah, well...
- Remember?

01:00:31.205 --> 01:00:35.369
Yeah, well, can you tell these assholes
to get away from me?

01:00:35.409 --> 01:00:38.208
I'll drive her home, it's not a big deal. OK?

01:00:39.714 --> 01:00:43.013
- You can't drive like this.
- What do you care?

01:00:44.285 --> 01:00:47.277
You're going to get arrested, let me drive you.

01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:49.657
Please?

01:00:53.394 --> 01:00:55.328
Damn it.

01:03:28.656 --> 01:03:31.820
I sold the truck to pay for the lawyer.

01:03:33.094 --> 01:03:35.289
I didn't ask for a lawyer.

01:03:36.531 --> 01:03:38.522
Marianne, I didn't ask for...

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:43.503
You want your children to spend another
two years without you? Is that what you want?

01:03:43.538 --> 01:03:45.836
This is God's will.

01:03:45.874 --> 01:03:47.808
So be it.

01:03:48.977 --> 01:03:51.775
Two years ago you didn't believe in anything.

01:03:51.813 --> 01:03:54.145
Now everything has to do with God.

01:03:55.418 --> 01:03:59.377
- I think I preferred you the way you were.
- I was a fucking pig.

01:03:59.422 --> 01:04:02.289
- Is that what you prefer?
- At least it was you.

01:04:02.324 --> 01:04:06.124
Now I don't have the slightest fucking idea
who you are.

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:11.897
Life has to go on, Jack. With or without God.

01:04:58.116 --> 01:04:59.947
Hey, how are you doing?

01:04:59.984 --> 01:05:01.884
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:05:01.919 --> 01:05:03.978
Were you able to find anything out?

01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:09.220
Jack Jordan's living in a cheap motel,
out in the middle of nowhere. Phone records.

01:05:09.628 --> 01:05:13.997
- One of his prison fishy pals is from there.
- That was quick.

01:05:14.032 --> 01:05:16.796
Just a matter of checking the calls.

01:05:16.835 --> 01:05:20.669
Phone number and address
for the motel he's living in.

01:05:22.274 --> 01:05:27.576
Here's a pretty recent photo of Jordan,
taken the last time he was in jail.

01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:32.909
Did you get that other thing I asked about?

01:05:32.951 --> 01:05:34.351
Mm-hm.

01:05:37.924 --> 01:05:39.789
This is a clean gun. No record.

01:05:42.128 --> 01:05:44.426
We call this an orphan.

01:05:44.464 --> 01:05:46.364
It is loaded.

01:05:47.567 --> 01:05:50.502
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful there, hoss.

01:05:50.537 --> 01:05:55.236
You don't have to cock it, just pull the trigger.
This releases the cylinder.

01:05:57.844 --> 01:06:00.939
I think we're set to go. That's all I wanna know.

01:06:02.316 --> 01:06:04.614
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:22.825
Ma'am, it's an hour since I called.

01:06:23.672 --> 01:06:26.573
46, St. Vincent Street.

01:06:27.642 --> 01:06:29.633
Thank you.

01:06:32.547 --> 01:06:35.414
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:06:38.153 --> 01:06:39.814
Some rain.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:47.955
- Do you not have your car?
- No, but my taxi will be here in a minute.

01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:51.532
I'm right over here. I can give you a lift.

01:06:51.567 --> 01:06:53.467
No, thanks.

01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:02.572
I'm the guy who drove your car home last week.

01:07:05.248 --> 01:07:07.842
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

01:07:07.884 --> 01:07:09.715
I left my jacket with you.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.353
Oh.

01:07:16.226 --> 01:07:18.057
Sorry.

01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:24.389
- I'll bring it by tomorrow.
- Are you sure I can't give you a ride?

01:07:24.434 --> 01:07:26.129
Or do you want to swim?

01:07:29.373 --> 01:07:31.341
OK.

01:07:58.036 --> 01:08:00.027
Hello.

01:08:24.897 --> 01:08:27.627
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.764
Let me just give you my cell phone number.

01:08:32.339 --> 01:08:34.671
So that you have it.

01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:42.578
Would you have lunch with me tomorrow?

01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:47.112
What for?

01:08:48.755 --> 01:08:53.625
You're going to have to eat at some point
and I'm very worried about those kidneys.

01:08:54.862 --> 01:08:58.662
Come on - Lawrence's, two o'clock?
It's very nearby.

01:09:00.868 --> 01:09:03.701
- Please?
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.808
Great.

- You want me to wait for a new heart?
- We don't have a lot of choice.

I can't do that. I can't wait for someone else to die
locked up in a fucking room. I can't do it.

01:12:40.797 --> 01:12:42.788
Will I be saved?

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:45.630
I can't guarantee it.

01:12:45.668 --> 01:12:50.628
But if you don't come back to hospital,
you're condemning yourself to a terrible death.

01:12:50.673 --> 01:12:52.903
Your heart won't work anymore.

01:12:52.942 --> 01:12:58.437
You'll die, asphyxiated.
It's an awful death, Paul, you can't imagine it.

01:12:58.481 --> 01:13:02.919
- At least here we can help you to...
- You can help me die better.

01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:07.523
That's what you're saying.
You can help me die better.

01:13:07.558 --> 01:13:09.719
I'm not going to do that.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.627
OK? I'd rather die outside.

01:13:15.032 --> 01:13:16.863
I'm not going to do it again.

01:13:22.906 --> 01:13:25.375
How much did the lawyer charge?

01:13:29.748 --> 01:13:32.114
Marianne, how much did the fucking lawyer...?

01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:34.380
- Enough.
- How much?

01:13:34.419 --> 01:13:37.911
Enough so your children can remember
your fucking face.

01:13:39.424 --> 01:13:43.793
Keep asking stupid questions
and I'm getting out at the next corner.

01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.740
Hi, guys, we're home.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:04.045
Daddy! Daddy! What did you bring us?

01:14:04.917 --> 01:14:08.648
- I brought you a kiss.
- You didn't bring me a present, huh?

01:14:08.688 --> 01:14:10.656
No, just a kiss.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.851
We made you a cake.

01:14:12.892 --> 01:14:16.590
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Freddy put the icing on it.

01:14:19.866 --> 01:14:23.267
Freddy, are you going to say hello to your father?

01:14:25.672 --> 01:14:29.438
Freddy drew those for you.
I drew those ones.

01:14:31.878 --> 01:14:34.506
- Mommy made the cake.
- Come here.

01:14:37.684 --> 01:14:41.121
She did?
Come look at the cake, Daddy.

01:14:51.566 --> 01:14:53.625
Come on, Daddy.

01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:58.662
There is a number hidden in every act of life,
in every aspect of the universe.

01:14:58.706 --> 01:15:03.406
Fractals, matter...
There's a number screaming to tell us something.

01:15:04.713 --> 01:15:06.840
- Am I boring you?
- No.

01:15:07.983 --> 01:15:10.383
No, l...

01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:13.916
- Sorry.
- I try to tell them

01:15:13.956 --> 01:15:19.451
That numbers are a door
to understanding a mystery that's bigger than us.

01:15:20.262 --> 01:15:23.493
How two people, strangers, come to meet.

01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:28.293
There's a poem by a Venezuelan writer
that begins,

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:34.005
"The earth turned to bring us closer.

01:15:34.911 --> 01:15:37.311
"lt turned on itself and in us

01:15:37.914 --> 01:15:41.247
"until it finally brought us together in this dream."

01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:49.319
That's beautiful.

01:15:49.359 --> 01:15:53.922
There are so many things that have to happen
for two people to meet...

01:15:53.964 --> 01:15:57.695
Anyway that's what mathematics are.

01:16:03.174 --> 01:16:06.940
How long have you been swimming?
A few years.

01:16:06.977 --> 01:16:11.971
- It doesn't bore you?
- No. It's what makes me feel normal.

01:16:12.016 --> 01:16:15.952
If I didn't swim or walk or do something,
I think I'd go crazy.

01:16:17.622 --> 01:16:19.590
Thanks for lunch.

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:22.991
Yeah. Goodbye.

01:16:24.196 --> 01:16:25.959
Do you want to come in?

01:16:25.997 --> 01:16:29.228
No, thanks... Yes, I do want to come in.

01:17:42.343 --> 01:17:43.776
Hey!

01:17:44.212 --> 01:17:46.373
Can I ask you something?

01:17:46.414 --> 01:17:47.881
Huh?

01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:51.010
OK, I have a gun, OK? Don't look at me.

01:17:51.052 --> 01:17:55.318
- Don't look at me, I'll shoot you. Turn around.
- I don't have any money.

01:17:55.356 --> 01:17:58.155
- Go. Walk. Walk.
- Hey, come on.

01:17:58.861 --> 01:18:02.058
- Put them up. Put your hands up.
- Why? Wait.

01:18:02.097 --> 01:18:04.657
Just walk. Go.

01:18:05.167 --> 01:18:07.067
- Go down that path.
- Sir...

01:18:07.102 --> 01:18:10.401
- Do it and you won't get hurt.
- Please. I don't have...

01:18:10.439 --> 01:18:12.134
I'm not looking...

01:18:12.174 --> 01:18:14.734
Come on, keep walking. Right down here.

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:19.009
Keep walking. Don't look at me,
I'll shoot you in the head. Hands up!

01:18:19.048 --> 01:18:23.509
Walk. Look, over here, over here. Come on.

01:18:23.553 --> 01:18:25.453
Don't look at me. Keep going.

01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:28.488
Stop. Right here, OK...

01:18:28.525 --> 01:18:31.551
Stop. Turn around.

01:18:31.595 --> 01:18:34.462
Keep your hands on your head.

01:18:35.031 --> 01:18:39.263
G-G-Get... Take your shoes off
and get down on your knees.

01:18:39.302 --> 01:18:41.236
Take off your shoes.

01:18:41.671 --> 01:18:45.904
No, not that one! Just get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

01:18:46.978 --> 01:18:49.071
Sir, please...

01:18:52.984 --> 01:18:55.043
Shouldn't have done it.

01:18:57.722 --> 01:19:00.452
- Done what?
- You shouldn't have done it!

01:19:02.326 --> 01:19:04.726
Close your goddamn eyes!

01:19:49.142 --> 01:19:52.839
- She looked me in the eyes.
- What are you talking about?

01:19:58.317 --> 01:20:01.014
One of the girls that I killed.

01:20:01.055 --> 01:20:03.114
She looked me in the eye.

01:20:07.795 --> 01:20:10.263
She wanted to tell me something.

01:20:13.133 --> 01:20:14.930
I left her.

01:20:14.968 --> 01:20:17.232
I left her there.

01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:23.734
I ran away.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.674
- No...
- I ran away.

01:20:27.716 --> 01:20:31.277
I ran away. I ran away.

01:20:31.319 --> 01:20:33.378
Ran away.

01:20:34.456 --> 01:20:36.924
- Ran away.
- Shh-shh-shh...

01:20:48.436 --> 01:20:51.304
- You're sticking with red?
- Sure.

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:35.679
Are you OK?

01:21:36.686 --> 01:21:38.552
Yeah.

01:21:41.058 --> 01:21:43.026
I, um...

01:21:44.996 --> 01:21:49.592
- I'm sorry, I had a dizzy...
- Can I get you a glass of water or something?

01:21:50.835 --> 01:21:52.769
I think I should go home.

01:21:53.538 --> 01:21:56.234
I'm sorry, I just...

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:07.212
I like you a lot, Cristina.

01:22:07.853 --> 01:22:11.789
It's been a long time
since I liked someone so much.

01:22:15.828 --> 01:22:17.853
Can I see you again?

01:22:20.332 --> 01:22:22.197
I'm a married woman.

01:22:24.536 --> 01:22:26.527
I figured.

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:36.772
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:23:00.196
I got peace like a river
I got peace like a river

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:05.804
I got peace like a river in my soul...

01:23:05.846 --> 01:23:09.839
- Everybody!
- I got love like an ocean

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:13.183
I got love like an ocean

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:18.716
I got love like an ocean in my soul

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:25.764
I got joy like a fountain
I got joy like a fountain

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.534
I got joy like a fountain in my soul...

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:35.499
Look, Daddy, these are the zebras
and these are the lions.

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:38.671
- Very pretty.
- You've never been to a zoo.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:41.273
- I've seen them in...
- Stop fighting.

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:47.248
The lawyer called to remind you
you have to go sign on Monday.

01:23:49.892 --> 01:23:52.156
If you want I'll go with you to church.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:55.686
In school they said
you killed two girls and their daddy.

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:57.995
Is that true?

01:23:58.935 --> 01:24:00.562
- Yes.
- No.

01:24:01.504 --> 01:24:05.304
Yes. He killed them.

01:24:06.309 --> 01:24:09.541
It was an accident, sweetie.

01:24:09.579 --> 01:24:11.570
You understand?

01:24:15.552 --> 01:24:20.182
Oh, Jesus,
every time I look at my children...

01:24:36.374 --> 01:24:38.205
Hello?

01:24:40.144 --> 01:24:41.805
Hello?

01:24:41.846 --> 01:24:43.677
'Paul?'

01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:50.447
Who... Who is this?

01:24:50.488 --> 01:24:52.422
'Cristina.

01:24:55.059 --> 01:24:57.028
'Did I wake you?'

01:24:58.063 --> 01:25:00.429
Hang on a second.

01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:07.098
Hi.

01:25:07.906 --> 01:25:10.807
- 'Did I wake you?'
- No, that's OK.

01:25:12.845 --> 01:25:16.281
'Um, could... could you come to my house?'

01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:21.717
- Is something wrong?
- 'No, I just...

01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:25.953
'l just want you to come if you can.

01:25:26.893 --> 01:25:30.329
- 'Or if you want to.'
- Yeah.

01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:33.522
I'll be right there.

01:25:33.566 --> 01:25:35.397
'Thanks.'

01:25:35.435 --> 01:25:37.096
OK.

01:25:40.974 --> 01:25:44.171
It's two in the morning, who were you talking to?

01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:46.202
I won't be long.

01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:49.246
Where are you going?

01:25:49.283 --> 01:25:53.913
- I said I won't be long.
- Exactly where and with who are you going?

01:25:55.122 --> 01:25:58.285
I thought you'd change after the transplant.

01:25:58.325 --> 01:26:00.657
And I thought you'd change if I did.

01:26:00.694 --> 01:26:02.685
Neither of us changed.

01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:56.746
- What's wrong?
- He's been shot in the chest.

01:26:56.786 --> 01:27:00.848
Come on.
Shot in the chest. In the chest.

01:27:01.892 --> 01:27:05.521
- How's long he's been like that?
- He's dying! We need a...

01:27:05.562 --> 01:27:07.655
I'll go get a stretcher.

01:27:07.698 --> 01:27:10.929
- Ma'am, he'll be right back.
- It's OK, baby.

01:27:13.003 --> 01:27:15.301
I shot him.

01:27:15.339 --> 01:27:17.534
- I don't have the gun.
- What?

01:27:17.574 --> 01:27:20.975
- I shot him.
- Control, I need you to call the police.

01:27:21.745 --> 01:27:24.647
It's an emergency, yes. I'm right out front.

01:27:36.161 --> 01:27:38.061
Hi.

01:27:40.832 --> 01:27:43.164
Are you OK?

01:27:53.045 --> 01:27:55.741
You kept me thinking all day.

01:27:57.316 --> 01:28:01.844
You see, I haven't spoken to anyone in months

01:28:01.887 --> 01:28:04.117
And I barely know you

01:28:04.156 --> 01:28:07.887
And I already need to talk to you.

01:28:10.095 --> 01:28:11.960
And...

01:28:14.067 --> 01:28:18.128
There's something
the more I think about, the less I understand.

01:28:21.541 --> 01:28:24.408
Why the hell did you tell me that you liked me?

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.379
Answer me because
I didn't like you saying that at all.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:38.020
You can't just walk up to a woman
you barely know and tell her you like her.

01:28:38.058 --> 01:28:41.722
You can't do that,
you don't know what she's going through.

01:28:42.296 --> 01:28:44.457
Or what she's feeling.

01:28:47.368 --> 01:28:49.700
I'm not married.

01:28:56.911 --> 01:28:59.505
- It's OK.
-

01:29:01.449 --> 01:29:03.714
- I'm sorry.
- No.

01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:37.517
Cristina... Wait.

01:29:38.454 --> 01:29:40.445
- I have to tell you something.
- OK.

01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:42.481
- Please.
- Kiss me.

01:29:42.525 --> 01:29:44.254
Wait, Cristina.

01:29:45.128 --> 01:29:46.993
Cristina...

01:29:49.832 --> 01:29:52.266
I have Michael's heart.

01:29:53.737 --> 01:29:55.728
I have Michael's heart.

01:29:58.008 --> 01:30:00.135
You understand what I'm saying?

01:30:00.544 --> 01:30:04.878
It was transplanted into me
at St. Francis Hospital on October 1 1th.

01:30:05.582 --> 01:30:07.049
No.

01:30:07.084 --> 01:30:10.611
I tried to tell you, I just didn't know how to tell you.

01:30:10.654 --> 01:30:12.645
How dare you?

01:30:13.624 --> 01:30:16.752
How dare you! How fucking dare you!

01:30:16.794 --> 01:30:19.559
- I'm here for a reason.
- Get out of my house!

01:30:21.232 --> 01:30:24.201
Don't touch me! Get out of my house now!

01:30:24.235 --> 01:30:27.170
- You make me sick!
- I'm here for a reason!

01:30:27.205 --> 01:30:28.968
Get out of my fucking...

01:30:29.007 --> 01:30:32.067
Get the fuck out of my house, you make me sick!

01:30:32.711 --> 01:30:34.406
Get out!

01:31:41.582 --> 01:31:43.573
Good morning.

01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:55.922
Why did you look for me?

01:31:59.435 --> 01:32:01.699
Because I needed to.

01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:05.665
I don't want your fucking pity.

01:32:07.576 --> 01:32:09.407
That wasn't it.

01:32:17.085 --> 01:32:20.020
I was sick, Cristina, I was very sick.

01:32:23.126 --> 01:32:26.960
I was dying when Michael gave me his heart.

01:32:31.134 --> 01:32:33.068
He saved my life.

01:32:38.975 --> 01:32:42.672
I tried in every way I knew how to find out...

01:32:43.379 --> 01:32:45.974
Who had given me this heart.

01:32:46.016 --> 01:32:50.385
And that's how I found out
how he and your daughters had died.

01:32:55.759 --> 01:32:59.024
It's very painful for me to know how I got this heart.

01:33:00.698 --> 01:33:03.030
I couldn't sleep.

01:33:03.934 --> 01:33:07.700
I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to help in some way.

01:33:07.738 --> 01:33:10.002
I just wanted to thank you for...

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.648
But I couldn't find you.

01:33:21.753 --> 01:33:23.584
And then I saw you

01:33:25.223 --> 01:33:27.282
That day.

01:33:30.762 --> 01:33:33.356
And now I can't be away from you.

01:33:37.069 --> 01:33:39.060
I can't.

01:33:46.646 --> 01:33:49.046
You don't have to be afraid.

01:33:51.717 --> 01:33:53.981
I've got a good heart.

01:34:10.704 --> 01:34:12.695
I'm scared too.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.082
- 'Why did you leave us, Jack?'
- I'm where I have to be.

01:36:06.124 --> 01:36:11.152
- 'Gina got sick from the hamster.'
- The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.

01:36:11.196 --> 01:36:13.494
Back when I was me.

01:36:13.532 --> 01:36:18.629
- But the decisions I make, that's my mirror.
- 'What are you talking about?'

01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:20.501
That's my mirror.

01:36:20.539 --> 01:36:24.635
- 'lt doesn't matter.'
- I have to live with them alone.

01:36:24.676 --> 01:36:27.167
- 'Come back to us.'
- I can't erase it.

01:36:27.212 --> 01:36:30.444
- 'Your family needs you.'
- No one can erase it.

01:36:32.485 --> 01:36:34.214
'For me...'

01:36:39.992 --> 01:36:43.553
We need to stabilize him
before we get him to the hospital.

01:36:43.596 --> 01:36:47.396
Right now, what we really need
are units of B-positive blood.

01:36:47.433 --> 01:36:49.697
I'm O-positive, will that work?

01:36:49.736 --> 01:36:52.330
Open and close your fist several times.

01:38:39.183 --> 01:38:41.413
'Go ahead.'

01:38:44.989 --> 01:38:47.150
OK, pal.

01:38:47.191 --> 01:38:49.625
You're free to go for lack of evidence.

01:38:51.796 --> 01:38:55.755
Your story doesn't check out,
it contradicts our investigation

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.498
And the statements made
by Mrs. Peck and Mr. Rivers.

01:39:00.305 --> 01:39:02.296
I just need you to sign here.

01:39:02.908 --> 01:39:04.933
What if I really am guilty?

01:39:05.544 --> 01:39:07.671
Yeah, well, it happens.

01:39:08.113 --> 01:39:11.344
It won't be the first time, it won't be the last.

01:40:14.582 --> 01:40:16.675
What are you doing?

01:40:16.718 --> 01:40:20.882
You've been lost for too many days,
don't you think, you prick?

01:40:21.456 --> 01:40:23.617
Mary, I don't want a fight.

01:40:23.658 --> 01:40:28.391
- I want this to end well.
- And that means disappearing for a few days?

01:40:29.297 --> 01:40:32.858
You just waited until you got better
to tell me to fuck off.

01:40:32.901 --> 01:40:34.835
I'm going back to London.

01:40:34.869 --> 01:40:37.668
- You can't keep doing this.
- Really?

01:40:37.707 --> 01:40:40.972
I'll have surgery
and I'll be inseminated with your child.

01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:43.478
- With or without you.
- Mary, what for?

01:40:43.512 --> 01:40:45.503
- Why?
- Because I want to.

01:40:47.249 --> 01:40:49.774
- Well, I won't authorize that.
- No?

01:40:49.819 --> 01:40:54.882
You already have. I have a signed copy
of your authorization to use your semen.

01:40:54.924 --> 01:40:57.916
- What do you gain?
- I get what I want.

01:40:57.994 --> 01:41:00.623
You decide if you come looking for me or not.

01:42:52.813 --> 01:42:56.943
'Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...

01:42:56.984 --> 01:43:00.977
- 'Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.'
-

01:43:01.021 --> 01:43:04.321
'Give me a call on my cell. See you in a bit. Bye.'

01:43:04.359 --> 01:43:08.523
'To repeat the message, press one.
To delete, press two.'

01:43:10.532 --> 01:43:14.662
'Hi, honey, I'm on my way home.
If you need me to pick up anything...

01:43:14.703 --> 01:43:19.140
- 'Girls, no, don't touch. Laura, stop it.'
-

01:43:19.174 --> 01:43:22.041
'Give me a call on my cell. See you in a bit. Bye.'

01:44:50.069 --> 01:44:54.267
- I'm grilling some chicken, you want any?
- No, thanks.

01:44:54.306 --> 01:44:56.297
I could make you a sandwich...

01:44:56.342 --> 01:44:58.503
No. No, no, no. No!

01:45:00.512 --> 01:45:02.343
Cristina, Cristina,

01:45:02.381 --> 01:45:04.042
Iisten to me.

01:45:04.583 --> 01:45:07.347
You don't need that shit. You need...

01:45:07.386 --> 01:45:10.220
Don't tell me what I need.

01:45:53.267 --> 01:45:55.394
Katie could have lived.

01:45:57.439 --> 01:45:58.872
What?

01:46:00.275 --> 01:46:03.938
She'd be alive right now
but that bastard left her there.

01:46:06.081 --> 01:46:08.515
Lying in the street.

01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:13.544
He left the three of them like animals.
He didn't care.

01:46:17.592 --> 01:46:19.787
At least she could be here with me.

01:46:21.096 --> 01:46:24.191
That son of a bitch is walking the streets.

01:46:24.233 --> 01:46:28.829
- And I can't even go into their room.
- He's walking the streets?

01:46:31.441 --> 01:46:33.432
I want to kill him.

01:46:33.476 --> 01:46:35.706
You want to kill him?

01:46:35.745 --> 01:46:39.875
I'm gonna kill Jack Jordan.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

01:46:39.916 --> 01:46:44.683
- Slow down, Cristina, just slow down.
- Slow down? Slow down?

01:46:44.721 --> 01:46:47.816
- While I what, huh? While I what?!
- Take it easy.

01:46:47.858 --> 01:46:51.487
Take it easy? My husband
and my little girls are dead

01:46:51.528 --> 01:46:53.792
And I'm supposed to take it fucking easy?!

01:46:54.565 --> 01:46:57.466
I can't just go on with my life!

01:46:57.501 --> 01:47:03.167
I am paralyzed here,
I am a fucking amputee, do you see that?!

01:47:03.574 --> 01:47:05.804
Who are you?!

01:47:05.843 --> 01:47:09.677
You owe it to Michael. No, you've got his heart,

01:47:09.713 --> 01:47:13.775
You're in his house, fucking his wife
and sitting in his chair!

01:47:13.818 --> 01:47:16.685
- We have to kill him!
- Not like this.

01:47:16.721 --> 01:47:19.121
Then how, tell me how!

01:47:38.244 --> 01:47:40.235
Katie died...

01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:44.474
With red shoelaces on.

01:47:44.517 --> 01:47:47.281
She hated red shoelaces.

01:47:50.389 --> 01:47:53.290
And she kept asking me
to get her some blue ones

01:47:53.325 --> 01:47:56.055
And I never got her the blue ones.

01:47:57.797 --> 01:48:01.962
She was wearing those fucking red shoelaces
when she was killed.

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.447
You shouldn't have done it.

01:48:21.488 --> 01:48:24.514
Close your... close your goddamn eyes!

01:48:34.869 --> 01:48:37.804
You... murderer.

01:48:37.839 --> 01:48:40.603
You just let them lie there on the street.

01:48:40.641 --> 01:48:45.669
Those two little girls, you just let them die
like dogs. I should have killed you.

01:48:47.882 --> 01:48:52.582
Now you disappear. Don't even
go back to the motel and get your things.

01:48:53.322 --> 01:48:55.313
Just disappear.

01:49:34.397 --> 01:49:36.831
Mrs. Peck.

01:49:36.866 --> 01:49:41.531
- How is he?
- We couldn't use your blood for his transfusion.

01:49:41.572 --> 01:49:47.135
We found high levels of illegal substances
in your blood. You're taking very high risks here.

01:49:47.177 --> 01:49:51.375
- That's my problem.
- In your state, I suggest you stop using them.

01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:56.450
- What are you talking about?
- You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck.

01:50:01.859 --> 01:50:06.388
- You're sure?
- You need to start taking care of yourself.

01:50:06.998 --> 01:50:10.195
We'll let you know when Mr. Rivers
is out of the O. R.

01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:04.180
Where were you?

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:10.493
Did you kill him?

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:13.090
Did you?

01:51:21.776 --> 01:51:23.971
Why didn't you wake me up?

01:51:25.713 --> 01:51:27.874
Where's the body?

01:51:28.583 --> 01:51:30.949
Nobody will ever find the body.

01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:04.282
I'm sorry.

01:52:04.319 --> 01:52:06.446
We're gonna go home now.

01:52:08.358 --> 01:52:11.156
Let's just get out of here, OK? Yeah?

01:52:15.131 --> 01:52:18.225
It's OK, baby. Just lie down.

01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:23.032
- I need to rest.
- I know.

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.671
I know.

01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:29.174
I'm sorry.

01:52:33.117 --> 01:52:35.585
I love you.

01:52:37.755 --> 01:52:40.417
I love you. I love you.

01:52:40.458 --> 01:52:41.925
Oh!

01:53:10.455 --> 01:53:12.446
Wake up.

01:53:13.558 --> 01:53:15.389
Mm? Mm?

01:53:15.427 --> 01:53:17.418
There's somebody outside.

01:53:49.029 --> 01:53:51.657
Oh, my God!

01:53:52.166 --> 01:53:54.999
- Oh, my God.
- You want to kill me?

01:53:56.503 --> 01:53:59.734
- What's he doing here?
- Here I am.

01:54:00.974 --> 01:54:02.703
Shoot me.

01:54:02.743 --> 01:54:06.474
- Quick... Oh!
-

01:54:06.513 --> 01:54:09.141
- Oh, my God.
-

01:54:09.183 --> 01:54:11.344
Do something!

01:54:55.865 --> 01:54:59.926
- Oh...
-

01:55:00.937 --> 01:55:02.871
No, baby. Oh, no...

01:55:02.906 --> 01:55:04.498
No, no...

01:55:04.541 --> 01:55:08.068
- Oh, my God! Baby... baby...
-

01:55:08.111 --> 01:55:10.045
Oh, my God...

01:55:11.214 --> 01:55:14.081
- Baby...
-

01:55:14.117 --> 01:55:17.348
Baby, baby, baby...

01:55:17.387 --> 01:55:19.218
Baby!

01:55:20.023 --> 01:55:23.754
- Oh, God! Call an ambulance.
-

01:55:26.864 --> 01:55:29.526
Call a fucking ambulance!

01:55:52.624 --> 01:55:54.683
'How many lives do we live?'

01:55:56.695 --> 01:55:59.289
'How many times do we die?

01:56:04.836 --> 01:56:11.071
'They say we all lose 21 grams
at the exact moment of our death.

01:56:11.843 --> 01:56:13.834
'Everyone.

01:56:15.581 --> 01:56:19.847
'And how much fits into 21 grams?

01:56:24.424 --> 01:56:26.688
'How much is lost?'

01:56:36.836 --> 01:56:39.566
'When do we lose 21 grams?

01:56:54.755 --> 01:56:56.780
'How much goes with them?

01:57:11.039 --> 01:57:13.030
'How much is gained?

01:57:23.151 --> 01:57:26.143
'How much is gained?

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.168
'21 grams.

01:57:40.603 --> 01:57:44.437
'The weight of a stack of five nickels,

01:57:44.473 --> 01:57:46.737
'the weight of a hummingbird.

01:57:47.777 --> 01:57:49.938
'A chocolate bar.

01:57:51.981 --> 01:57:54.917
'How much do 21 grams weigh?'

01:58:19.277 --> 01:58:21.472
To Maria Eladia.

01:58:21.512 --> 01:58:26.347
And when loss was burnt,
the maize fields became green again

02:00:37.787 --> 02:00:40.620
One last kiss

02:00:40.656 --> 02:00:43.648
One only

02:00:44.627 --> 02:00:46.891
Then I'd let you go

02:00:49.733 --> 02:00:52.861
Hard for you

02:00:52.903 --> 02:00:55.269
I've fallen

02:00:56.206 --> 02:00:59.175
But you can break my fall

02:01:01.745 --> 02:01:04.714
I'm broken

02:01:04.748 --> 02:01:07.342
Don't break me

02:01:08.585 --> 02:01:10.985
When I hit the ground

02:01:13.324 --> 02:01:16.350
Some devil

02:01:16.394 --> 02:01:19.158
Some angel

02:01:20.098 --> 02:01:23.556
Has got me to the bones

02:01:25.303 --> 02:01:30.297
You said always and forever

02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:37.143
Now I believe you, baby

02:01:37.182 --> 02:01:43.246
You said always and forever

02:01:44.757 --> 02:01:49.194
Is such a long, lonely time

02:02:01.541 --> 02:02:04.476
Too drunk and

02:02:04.511 --> 02:02:07.275
Still drinking

02:02:08.515 --> 02:02:11.245
It's just the way I feel

02:02:13.853 --> 02:02:16.515
It's all right

02:02:16.556 --> 02:02:19.354
That's what you told me

02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:24.897
Cos what we had was so beautiful

02:02:25.732 --> 02:02:28.930
I feel heavy

02:02:28.969 --> 02:02:31.529
Like floating

02:02:32.406 --> 02:02:37.434
At the bottom of the sea

02:02:37.478 --> 02:02:43.678
You said always and forever

02:02:45.319 --> 02:02:49.312
Now I believe you, baby

02:02:49.357 --> 02:02:55.661
You said always and forever

02:02:57.132 --> 02:03:02.297
Is such a long, lonely time

02:03:14.049 --> 02:03:16.883
Some devil is

02:03:16.919 --> 02:03:19.945
Stuck inside of me

02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:24.920
I cannot set it free

02:03:24.961 --> 02:03:31.730
I wish, I wish I was dead and you were breathing

02:03:32.769 --> 02:03:35.533
Just so that you could know

02:03:37.874 --> 02:03:41.003
Some angel is

02:03:41.044 --> 02:03:44.639
Stuck inside of me

02:03:44.681 --> 02:03:47.878
I cannot set you free

02:03:49.953 --> 02:03:55.949
You said always and forever

02:03:57.628 --> 02:04:01.928
Now I believe you, baby

02:04:01.965 --> 02:04:07.927
You said always and forever

02:04:09.908 --> 02:04:14.777
Such a long, lonely time

02:04:17.215 --> 02:04:19.877
Stuck inside of me
