00:00.535 --> 00:01.702
Oh, my goodness.

00:01.737 --> 00:03.004
This dude Brian Nicholera
I went to high school with

00:03.038 --> 00:05.705
just friended me, he just moved
here. Oh, my God.

00:05.741 --> 00:08.009
People from high school
only friend you, like,

00:08.042 --> 00:10.845
after business hours if they wanna hook up.

00:10.879 --> 00:12.780
Really? I had a huge crush on him.

00:12.814 --> 00:15.449
Oh, you should ask him
out. I can't just do that.

00:15.484 --> 00:18.719
Oh, my God, he "likes" "Roseanne."

00:18.754 --> 00:19.954
Okay, this is--

00:19.988 --> 00:22.023
This is your new sexual partner.

00:22.057 --> 00:24.325
All right, I'm asking him out.

00:24.359 --> 00:27.661
I'm just gonna do it. Do it.

00:27.696 --> 00:29.163
This is so great.

00:29.197 --> 00:32.933
Like, why are we waiting for
guys to come to us, Ilana?

00:32.968 --> 00:35.503
Did Amelia Earhart wait to be

00:35.537 --> 00:36.937
asked to fly around the world?

00:36.972 --> 00:38.906
Definitely not.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.775
She asked.

00:40.809 --> 00:42.710
And then they said no.

00:42.744 --> 00:44.278
But she still did it.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.447
And she died, but she, like, died doing it.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.748
(Abbi) Exactly.

00:47.783 --> 00:49.417
I'm doing it again,
I'm asking someone else out.

00:49.451 --> 00:51.485
This is the Abbi I love and fell in love with

00:51.520 --> 00:52.820
and I'm obsessed with.

00:52.854 --> 00:53.988
Skylar Cummings- Conkelmann,

00:54.022 --> 00:55.222
I used to babysit for him.

00:55.257 --> 00:56.757
He was adorable.

00:56.792 --> 00:58.459
He's...

00:58.493 --> 01:00.327
Yeah, he's 20, that's acceptable.

01:00.362 --> 01:01.896
Troy Megliarino.

01:01.930 --> 01:05.099
He spent a hot sec in jail,
but he lives in South Jersey

01:05.132 --> 01:07.101
and I know he'd steal a car
and come up for the night.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.603
Chris Wazcyleski, he was a nude model

01:09.638 --> 01:11.539
in my life drawing class and he, like,

01:11.573 --> 01:13.974
always angled himself out to me.

01:14.009 --> 01:15.242
Chad Michael Fong.

01:15.277 --> 01:17.912
We met at a hardware
store, he was disgusting.

01:17.946 --> 01:19.914
You know, I'm picking all
white dudes right now.

01:19.948 --> 01:22.349
I must be craving pink dick.

01:22.384 --> 01:23.751
I'm gonna go with this.

01:23.785 --> 01:25.119
(Abbi) Okay, who else, who else?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.788
Henry Rowdenbush, had a unibrow
all through middle school

01:27.823 --> 01:30.558
and then he started waxing it
and all of a sudden it was like,

01:30.592 --> 01:32.426
glasses off, you're (bleep) gorgeous.

01:32.461 --> 01:33.627
It's like "She's All That."

01:33.662 --> 01:35.429
I feel like I'm on coke right now.

01:35.464 --> 01:36.564
P.J. Mallory.

01:36.598 --> 01:37.598
Bobby Cornhauser.

01:37.632 --> 01:39.033

01:39.067 --> 01:40.201
Ryan Long.

01:40.235 --> 01:41.435
Rod White.

01:41.470 --> 01:45.106
We are, like, feminist heroes right now.

01:47.876 --> 01:50.444
So, okay, that's 36 guys

01:50.479 --> 01:54.248
that we've been rejected by and one lady.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.050
Okay, so what, dude? You know what?

01:56.084 --> 01:57.418
The Internet is so '90s.

01:57.452 --> 02:00.254
Let's go find some guys IRL.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.856
You know, you can just say "in real life."

Philadelphia.

02:21.343 --> 02:23.244
When I was five, I was actually an extra

02:23.278 --> 02:25.613
in the movie "Philadelphia."

02:25.647 --> 02:27.781
It filmed right near my dad's office.

02:27.816 --> 02:32.119
So I learned about AIDS
before a lot of my friends.

02:32.154 --> 02:34.455
Yeah, this is her.

02:34.489 --> 02:36.524
There's Abbi again.

02:36.558 --> 02:38.192
Ugh, Abbi in outdoor lighting.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.194
We're best friends, and so, it's--

02:40.228 --> 02:42.630

Yes, are you kidding me? No, yeah.

connection with someone

02:53.041 --> 02:54.375

02:59.614 --> 03:02.049

Yeah, just put it in my phone. Okay.

09:52.962 --> 09:54.062
Are you kidding me? Ilana, stop.

09:54.097 --> 09:55.897
No, this park is full of pervs.

09:55.932 --> 09:57.332

right now, okay. Find your phone.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.541
This is crazy right now.

10:06.576 --> 10:09.010
Only in NYC!

10:09.045 --> 10:13.381

phone out and take a pic!

10:13.416 --> 10:16.051
Why is no one taking a picture of her?

10:16.085 --> 10:19.521
That girl's been here for hours.

10:19.555 --> 10:21.756
(Abbi) All right, well, I understand that.

10:21.791 --> 10:23.825

11:13.543 --> 11:14.643
It's gonna be unfair to whoever I marry,

18:52.869 --> 18:54.837
<i>Uh-oh, someone's</i> <i>making a cake mess.</i>

18:54.871 --> 18:56.238
<i>You know what's</i> <i>good for that?</i>

18:56.272 --> 18:58.874
<i>Is if you just get</i> <i>a napkin or a paper towel,</i>

18:58.908 --> 19:00.242
<i>or a thick napkin--</i>

19:00.276 --> 19:01.243
(Ilana) Oh, my God. <i>It's just--</i>

19:01.277 --> 19:02.411
(Ilana) Please stop.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.912
Thanks. Okay.

19:03.947 --> 19:05.114
Goodbye.

19:05.148 --> 19:06.515
<i>(Ilana)</i> <i>Bye!</i>

19:06.549 --> 19:07.983
<i>And learn</i> <i>Settlers of Catan.</i>

19:08.018 --> 19:10.185
<i>It's honestly</i> <i>not that hard.</i>

19:10.788 --> 19:12.322
Allright, do a face that I hate.

19:12.356 --> 19:16.393
Oh.

19:16.427 --> 19:18.061
Oh, my God, it won't let me--

19:18.095 --> 19:19.596
It says my storage is full.

19:19.630 --> 19:22.499
That sucks for you.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.801
What is...

19:24.835 --> 19:26.136
Look at this.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.937
Hi, baby.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.372
I am in a boat.

19:29.407 --> 19:33.443
Oh, my God, I love this city.

19:34.346 --> 19:35.446
Where is Central Park?

19:35.480 --> 19:36.914
(man) You're in it. Oh, my God.

19:36.948 --> 19:40.217
Central Perk.

19:40.252 --> 19:42.253
The one with Gunther.

19:42.287 --> 19:43.788
And "Smelly Cat"?

19:43.822 --> 19:46.390
(mumbling)

19:46.425 --> 19:46.758
Baby...

19:46.793 --> 19:50.962
I have a sweet surprise for you.

19:50.997 --> 19:52.731
Here it comes.

19:52.765 --> 19:54.166
She's gonna jerk off.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.600
No, no, no, no, no, we shouldn't watch it.

19:55.635 --> 19:56.835
Ilana, we should not watch it.

19:56.869 --> 19:59.104
This is not a time for
prudeness, Abbi. Okay, fine!

19:59.138 --> 20:01.440
So you ready?

20:05.478 --> 20:08.447
(coughing)

20:11.617 --> 20:13.118
Oh.

20:13.152 --> 20:15.320
That was... you know?

20:15.354 --> 20:16.922
That was phenomenal. Oh, my God.

20:16.956 --> 20:19.458
Send that to my burner phone, that last one.

20:19.492 --> 20:20.726
You have a burner phone?

20:20.760 --> 20:22.060
You didn't know that? No.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.361
Why do you have that?

20:23.396 --> 20:25.864
For dick pics and sex media in general.

20:25.898 --> 20:27.699
Why would you need a phone from, like,

20:27.734 --> 20:29.101
"The Wire" for that?

20:29.135 --> 20:31.603
I'm still on my family plan
and I don't fully understand

20:31.637 --> 20:33.672
the cloud and I don't trust it.

20:33.706 --> 20:36.942
I mean, I can't risk having
just dicks floating around.

20:36.976 --> 20:38.076
I feel like they're gonna, like,

20:38.111 --> 20:39.544
pop up on my parents' phone one day.

20:39.579 --> 20:42.681
How many dicks are floating around?

20:47.053 --> 20:49.121
You're counting a lot.

20:49.155 --> 20:51.556
Like, in the late 20s?

20:52.305 --> 20:58.173
