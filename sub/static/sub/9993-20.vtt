00:18.300 --> 00:20.070
Hello?

00:20.900 --> 00:22.360
Hello?

00:44.070 --> 00:45.420
Hello?

00:47.710 --> 00:49.190
Hello?

01:18.820 --> 01:20.140
Hello?

02:40.890 --> 02:42.900
Mom,next me
can I pour the milk?

02:42.900 --> 02:44.050
We'll see,sweetie.

02:44.050 --> 02:45.560
You have to be able
to get it in the bowl.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.430
-Ariel...
-I can do that.

02:47.430 --> 02:48.870
I pour good.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.750
You don't pour good,
you pour well.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.110
Okay,so when
can I start pouring?

02:53.110 --> 02:55.290
As soon as they
get rid of gravity.

02:56.130 --> 02:59.050
First we have to promote you
to cereal pouring detail.

02:59.050 --> 03:00.820
I'm getting a promotion?

03:00.820 --> 03:04.820
Starting tomorrow.We'll start with the cereal,
we'll see how it goes.Then we'll think about milk.

03:04.820 --> 03:07.080
I'm getting a promotion!

03:07.080 --> 03:10.520
Girls,keep it down to a dull roar.
Your dad's still sleeping.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.060
No,he's not.

03:17.020 --> 03:18.710
Aren't you going
to have any breakfast?

03:18.710 --> 03:21.190
This is breakfast.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.900
I got out of there ten of 2:00,

03:23.900 --> 03:26.020
and what is it now-- it's 7:20.

03:26.020 --> 03:28.550
I've got to be back
there in 45 minutes.

03:28.550 --> 03:30.490
It's been over a week
now like this.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.210
No wonder you're so tired.

03:32.210 --> 03:35.010
They got guys working
on this project in their late 20s.

03:35.010 --> 03:38.570
They're out of there,like,
7:00,8:00 at night.

03:39.270 --> 03:42.230
They can do the work while talking
on their cell phone at the same time

03:42.230 --> 03:45.210
that they're checking a blog
and e-mailing a friend.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.600
I'm barely 40,

03:48.100 --> 03:50.370
and I feel like an antique.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.400
Well,that's crazy.
You've been there nine years.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.820
You have more experience
than anyone else.

03:55.820 --> 03:59.110
Yeah,I cost them more
than anyone else,too.

03:59.860 --> 04:04.000
I just... I can't shake the feeling
that this project is some kind of a bake-off.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.990
That when it's all done,
the winner is going to get a pat on the back,

04:06.990 --> 04:09.350
the loser's going to get
shown out the door.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.290
What do you mean loser?

04:11.290 --> 04:13.210
It's a project,
not a contest.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.660
How do you know?

04:14.660 --> 04:16.360
I don't know.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.579
Well,okay then.
I work there. I do.

04:22.650 --> 04:24.470
I feel like I never see you.

04:24.470 --> 04:27.070
That's because
you never do see me.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.240
I don't get a kiss?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.530
Huh?

04:34.530 --> 04:38.050
Nothing.I'll see you tonight,
or whenever.

04:40.460 --> 04:41.980
-sir?
-Yep.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.240
I have those parole applications
you asked me to take a look at.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.630
Great. Anything in there
jump out at you?

04:47.630 --> 04:48.370
Not really.

04:48.370 --> 04:51.430
Just a collection of horrible
human beings looking for a little mercy

04:51.430 --> 04:54.120
despite the fact that they had
none for their victims.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.790
Yeah,today is the day.
Parole board hearings. Yahoo.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.460
Nothing like spending time in a concrete bunker
listening to a bunch of vermin swear

05:01.460 --> 05:03.630
that they've
seen the light,found the way,

05:03.630 --> 05:06.790
and if only you'll let them out into society
they'll cure cancer and

05:06.790 --> 05:10.060
make the world safe
for old ladies and orphans.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.120
Care to come with?

05:16.390 --> 05:17.490
Is there a problem?

05:17.490 --> 05:20.250
Oh,no. I just have
to pick up my girls from school.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.470
Joe's been working crazy hours
on this project.

05:22.470 --> 05:25.560
That shouldn't be a problem.
This will only take a couple hours.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.590
so how does this work?

05:29.590 --> 05:32.470
It's pretty cut and dried.
The prisoner is announced by the parole board.

05:32.470 --> 05:36.360
He's given an opportunity to make his statement--
express remorse for his crimes.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.830
Once the board has her his request,
they'll ask if we have any objections.

05:42.620 --> 05:45.550
Tell us about the crime
you committed,mr. Cosgrove.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.300
I shot my wife.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.990
You shot her 16 times,mr. Cosgrove,
in the back.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.240
You killed her.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.960
What the board needs to
determine at this time

05:59.960 --> 06:03.590
is do you regret that you
committed this crime?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.920
I do,sir.I regret it every day
of my life.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.350
I'm a very different man
from the one who arrived here ten years ago.

06:10.350 --> 06:14.320
I work hard to be a better person.
I gave my life over to the lord.

06:15.980 --> 06:18.120
Would the state
care to comment?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.060
Due to the heinous nature
of this crime,

06:21.060 --> 06:23.810
as well as to the fact
that,to my recollection,

06:23.810 --> 06:27.050
this prisoner has never
shown any remorse before this hearing,

06:27.050 --> 06:30.510
the state would ask that parole
be denied at this time.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.960
The board is inclined to agree.
Parole is denied.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.930
Don't worry,just
onmore to go.

06:36.930 --> 06:40.600
The board will now
consider the petition of mr. Sam elkin.

06:41.070 --> 06:42.980
You've served five years
of a life sentence,

06:42.980 --> 06:47.180
and this is the first time you've been eligible
to appear before the parole board,correct?

06:47.180 --> 06:50.190
Yes,sir.
That's correct,sir.

06:50.190 --> 06:52.850
Tell us about
your crime,mr. Elkin.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.630
Mr. Elkin?

06:57.960 --> 07:00.080
You know what I did.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.230
It's important that
we hear it from you.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.790
I guess I kidnapped
my girlfriend...

07:08.790 --> 07:11.350
my ex-girlfriend.

07:12.610 --> 07:14.720
We broke up
about a month before...

07:14.720 --> 07:18.150
she broke up-- it was her idea.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.230
I wait for her in her car.
I had a key.

07:22.230 --> 07:25.960
She used to let me use it.
Anyway,I waited for her.

07:27.020 --> 07:30.300
I knew she'd be going out.
It was tuesday.

07:30.670 --> 07:33.520
She always went out on tuesdays.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.980
I forced her to drive
out into the desert.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.360
And once
we were there,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.380
we... we did it.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.450
I... I made her do it.

07:47.980 --> 07:50.370
When we were done,I just,

07:50.680 --> 07:53.560
uh,started choking her.

07:53.820 --> 07:57.280
She was tiny.
It didn't take long.

07:58.730 --> 08:00.690
It was almost
morning by then,

08:00.690 --> 08:05.790
so I drove her car back into the city
with her dead body in the passenger seat.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.770
Pulled into a busy car wash
on bell road.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.330
The kind with two lanes--
one where they clean the inside,

08:15.330 --> 08:19.860
and an express where the car just goes
through unattended and they clean the outside.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.970
Once the car
was inside the wash,

08:23.970 --> 08:27.280
I,uh,just turned
and walked away.

08:38.929 --> 08:41.659
that's what you needed
to hear,right?

08:43.100 --> 08:46.860
It's my understanding that until you became
eligible for parole this month,

08:46.860 --> 08:50.940
you repeatedly denied
committing any of these crimes.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.810
Uh,yes,sir.

08:52.810 --> 08:55.440
And I regret that,sir.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.000
Mr. District attorney?

09:00.230 --> 09:03.850
While I am moved to finally hear mr. Elkin
admit to these heinous acts,

09:03.850 --> 09:06.740
I can't help but be suspicious
of his motives.

09:06.740 --> 09:10.550
Mr. Elkin is,after all,well aware that
taking responsibility for his crimes

09:10.550 --> 09:13.610
is a condition
of his parole eligibility.

09:13.790 --> 09:16.710
Perhaps his apology
and remorse will carry more weight

09:16.710 --> 09:19.540
when he has another five
years to sleep on them.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.770
hello?

10:09.920 --> 10:11.500
I'm lonely.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.160
Hi,lonely.
My name's joe.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.460
So what do you think? What are the chances
i'll see you before today becomes tomorrow?

10:19.540 --> 10:22.680
Uh,you wouldn't happen to know
what the temperature in hell is,would you?

10:22.680 --> 10:25.780
You haven't heard anything about
a big freeze,maybe?

10:25.780 --> 10:28.660
They didn't mention it
on the news,no.

10:28.940 --> 10:32.050
Mm. Then I'm probably
going to be here for a while.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.240
talk to me.
Tell me about your day.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.780
I sat in on
a parole hearing today.

10:42.150 --> 10:45.410
Heard this guy confess
that he killed his girlfriend.

10:45.820 --> 10:48.700
I got this strong feeling
that he didn't do it.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.210
And?

10:50.990 --> 10:54.690
And I just had a dream about him
kissing this woman.

10:54.690 --> 10:57.250
-The dead girlfriend?
-Someone else.

10:57.250 --> 11:01.480
You know what I think?I think you've got
kissing on the brain.

11:02.270 --> 11:07.270
No one's kissed me on the brain,or anywhere
else for that matter,for quite some time.

11:07.270 --> 11:08.950
Oops.

11:08.950 --> 11:11.790
I think break time is over.

11:11.790 --> 11:15.180
-Love you,too.
-Love you,three.

11:37.630 --> 11:41.060
whatever you want,
you're going to have to do it yourself.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.100
Not funny.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.370
When did you get in?

11:46.370 --> 11:49.910
I don't know.I couldn't bear to
look at the clock.

11:51.250 --> 11:54.000
I really have to
get some sleep.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.880
I just found out the client's
coming in tomorrow at 3:00 for an update.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.900
-Oh,crap.
-What?

12:01.900 --> 12:06.620
Did we ever get my suit pants fixed
after the cuff came unraveled at christmas?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.730
"We"? If by "we,"

12:09.730 --> 12:12.220
you really mean "me," then no.

12:12.220 --> 12:14.020
"We" didn't know
about your cuff.

12:14.020 --> 12:17.660
Okay,forget it.
I'll wear shorts and a t-shirt.

12:17.660 --> 12:20.970
I can go straight from the meeting
to unemployment and then directly

12:20.970 --> 12:23.920
to the car wash
to look for a job.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.090
hey... there is a tailor

12:32.090 --> 12:36.640
who works at the mall by city hall
who does alterations while you wait.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.820
I can drop them off first thing
and pick them up at lunch.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.480
On second thought,
bring those brains of yours over here.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.180
I think I do feel
like kissing them.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.920
No,I just felt him there,

13:04.920 --> 13:08.450
and he was standing over my bed,
just looming there.

13:08.450 --> 13:12.170
And then he leaned down...
and then he kissed me.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.850
you'd better not be playing
solitaire on that computer.

13:19.850 --> 13:22.320
It's almost 2:00.
You're cutting it close.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.310
You're welcome.

13:24.310 --> 13:27.500
I'm sorry. There was a thank you in there.
You just didn't hear it.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.290
Well,you're right.
I'm running late.

13:33.350 --> 13:36.060
The strangest thing happened
to me on the way over here.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.150
I saw this woman.

13:38.690 --> 13:43.010
She looked just like that girl i've been seeing
in my dreams--the one who keeps getting kissed?

13:43.010 --> 13:46.010
She was going up an escalator.
I was going down.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.320
Geez.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.570
There's no reason some stranger in a mall
should be getting all the action.

14:07.550 --> 14:11.000
I'm sorry i haven't been around.
Thank you for lunch.

14:11.400 --> 14:15.420
You tip all the delivery people that way,
or was that special for me?

14:19.350 --> 14:20.830
forgive me,mr. Dubois.

14:20.830 --> 14:24.360
I just wanted to remind you we're going
to be leaving in approximately 30 minutes.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.800
I'm all over it,edrick.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.440
I'm just going to grab a bite to eat,
and then I'm going to change.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.310
Edrick,this is my wife,allison.
Allison,this is edrick,

14:31.310 --> 14:35.600
who is single-handedly
making it tough for mere mortals like me

14:35.830 --> 14:39.330
to have to work anything less
than a 24-hour day.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.370
Joe...

14:43.590 --> 14:45.740
I need your help...

14:47.770 --> 14:49.310
Allison?

14:56.510 --> 14:57.860
edrick?

14:57.860 --> 14:59.360
First generation american.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.610
My parents didn't speak much english
when I was born,but they loved american names.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.960
Couldn't decide
between ed and rick.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.790
Ed-rick.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.860
Nice meeting you,
mrs. Dubois.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.070
-Thirty...
-minutes.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.290
I'm counting the seconds.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.810
The elkin case?

15:15.810 --> 15:18.460
Sam elkin? Why would you want
to revisit the elkin case?

15:18.460 --> 15:22.550
It's five years old.The case is closed.
The accused man confessed.

15:22.550 --> 15:25.210
Call me old-fashioned,
but if you want to revisit old cases,

15:25.210 --> 15:27.280
I'd certainly prefer that
you find one that's unsolved

15:27.280 --> 15:28.930
and where the guilty party
isn't already behind bars.

15:28.930 --> 15:30.780
I told you yesterday
i felt strongly

15:30.780 --> 15:34.400
i'm star to regret king you to come with.
Tat.D I told you yesterday i complete agree.

15:34.450 --> 15:37.940
He was lying...about feeling badly,
about being filled with remorse,

15:37.940 --> 15:41.260
abouhis supposed concern
for amanda crane's friends and family.

15:41.260 --> 15:44.050
-I have court.
-Mr. District attorney...

15:44.050 --> 15:47.580
-allison,look at the coroner's report.
-I did.

15:47.580 --> 15:51.350
Then you know that elkin's sperm was still
inside the victim when we recovered her body.

15:51.980 --> 15:55.770
There's got to be something more than just
your sense that this man wasn't being truthful.

15:56.310 --> 15:57.970
I've been having
this dream...

15:58.650 --> 16:01.180
This wom not the victim--
she's lying in bed in the dark.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.900
Her lover comes up
and steals a kiss.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.360
Sounds romantic.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.910
Up until last night,
the man had no face.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.180
Now I see it's sam elkin.

16:09.180 --> 16:10.340
I'm not sure I know
what that means.

16:10.340 --> 16:14.530
I'm not sure I know what it means,either,
but I actually saw this woman today,

16:14.530 --> 16:17.140
a block away from here
at the mall.

16:17.140 --> 16:20.080
Seems to me there must be some reason
i'm dreaming these dreams,

16:20.080 --> 16:22.460
some reason i met elkin yesterday,

16:22.460 --> 16:25.490
some reason I crossed paths
with this woman today.

16:28.110 --> 16:31.990
Go talk to scanlon.If the two of you can
find something in the file worth looking at...

16:31.990 --> 16:33.580
thank you.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.200
Excuse me,uh,I'm looking
for detective lee scanlon.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.620
That's his desk over there.
Must have stepped out for a second.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.849
ExcuseE.

17:10.849 --> 17:14.240
Uh,you look a bit upset.
My name's,uh,allison dubois.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.700
I work with the district
attorney's office.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.680
I was wondering if I can be
of some kind of help to you.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.300
I don't know.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.339
I've been waiting to see a detective
since early this morning.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.890
I came here with a friend.
We waited for an hour and a half,

17:25.890 --> 17:29.850
then they told us to go away for an hour.
So we took a walk around the mall,came back.

17:29.850 --> 17:32.330
Then they said it would be another
two to three hours.

17:32.330 --> 17:35.650
My friend finally had to leave.
I'm missing a day's work.

17:36.260 --> 17:39.350
You know what? I work with one
of the detectives here.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.670
Let me see if I can't get him
to talk to you.

17:41.670 --> 17:43.890
Oh,thanks. That would be great.

17:53.850 --> 17:55.350
I'm sorry,miss...?

17:55.350 --> 17:56.620
Walsh.

17:56.620 --> 17:59.210
Kathleen walsh.
I'm not married.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.360
Mrs. Dubois explained you've been waiting
a long while.What can we help you with?

18:02.360 --> 18:05.410
Well,I should tell you,
I called the police yesterday morning.

18:05.410 --> 18:06.730
They came by
my house,but...

18:06.730 --> 18:09.170
start from the beginning.
Tell us what happened.

18:10.230 --> 18:12.460
Six months ago,i
moved to phoenix--

18:12.460 --> 18:15.440
just before the start of the school year.
I teach music.

18:16.350 --> 18:20.520
Anyway,I found this wonderful apartment
for very little money.

18:21.410 --> 18:25.350
But shortly after i settled in,
I began to hear noises...

18:25.350 --> 18:27.010
only at night.

18:27.010 --> 18:29.910
They'd start just as I was
getting ready for bed.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.360
Do you have any pets?

18:35.360 --> 18:38.020
A cat-- boots.

18:39.050 --> 18:42.110
But I've had him,like,forever.
He doesn't make these sounds.

18:42.110 --> 18:44.140
Okay,so you heard
there sounds...

18:44.140 --> 18:47.090
yeah. I would call out,
but no one would answer.

18:47.090 --> 18:49.040
Uh,this would happen...

18:49.040 --> 18:51.470
like,three,maybe
four times a week.

18:51.470 --> 18:52.920
So what'd you do?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.670
I didn't think that there was
anything to do.

18:55.670 --> 18:58.630
I wasn't certain that
there was anything really there...

18:58.940 --> 19:01.840
so frankly,for a long
time,I did nothing.

19:02.060 --> 19:04.270
But then the noises
started to change.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.460
What do you mean? Change how?

19:07.020 --> 19:09.500
Well,there was
this clicking sound.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.890
Clicking?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.480
-a camera.
-Huh?

19:17.480 --> 19:20.520
I was wondering if you thought
it sounded like a camera.

19:22.290 --> 19:24.170
Um... I don't know.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.750
Okay. Whatever it was,
there's this new sound.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.440
And I ignored that
for a while,too.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.900
But then two
nights ago...

19:31.900 --> 19:34.080
I felt him there...

19:34.380 --> 19:36.140
close.

19:36.410 --> 19:38.790
He was standing
over the bed.

19:39.730 --> 19:42.700
Forgive me for asking,but how do you
know that?How do you know he was there?

19:51.110 --> 19:53.240
Stand up.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.070
Excuse me?

19:55.070 --> 19:57.310
Would you stand up,please?

20:01.310 --> 20:03.230
Close your eyes.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.480
Any questions?

20:19.230 --> 20:20.710
No.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.810
and then?

20:39.510 --> 20:41.610
He kissed me.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.670
So what'd you do?

20:45.670 --> 20:47.630
I screamed.

20:48.050 --> 20:49.980
And then he was gone.

20:49.980 --> 20:52.350
And then i
called the police,

20:52.350 --> 20:55.160
and then the police came over.
And then--

20:55.160 --> 20:57.450
I have no way
of proving this...

20:57.980 --> 20:59.820
but I think they
laughed at me.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.370
Whoa,hold it,you're...
I want to make sure i've got this right.

21:02.370 --> 21:06.130
You're not alleging that this guy raped you,
struck you,fondled you?

21:06.580 --> 21:09.070
A man broke into my apartment...

21:09.410 --> 21:11.270
and he kissed me.

21:14.160 --> 21:14.860
miss walsh...

21:14.860 --> 21:17.210
you're going to tell me
to change the locks,

21:17.210 --> 21:19.340
move in with a friend...

21:20.080 --> 21:21.900
buy a big dog?

21:24.890 --> 21:26.610
Can I see you,allison,uh...

21:27.280 --> 21:29.590
in private for one second?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.760
-What are you doing to me?
-What am I doing to you?

21:35.160 --> 21:37.430
Shouldn't the question be
what are you gonna do for that woman?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.810
Uh,no.
I don't think so.

21:38.810 --> 21:41.510
What is your problem?
She's clearly being victimized.

21:41.510 --> 21:42.920
She came to you
for help.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.580
Victimized?

21:44.580 --> 21:46.810
A man keeps breaking
into her apartment.

21:46.810 --> 21:48.800
-Maybe.
-No. Not maybe.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.190
Based on what she's telling me,

21:50.190 --> 21:53.230
the police who went into her apartment
couldn't find any evidence of a break in.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.780
-And obviously,there's no witnesses.
-She is a witness.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.730
I don't think so. To what?

21:57.730 --> 21:59.180
To the breaking and entering.

21:59.180 --> 22:02.030
Well it doesn't actually appear
as though there was any breaking.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.450
Which would lead me to suspect that there
probably wasn't any real entering,either.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.810
So what do you want me to do?

22:06.810 --> 22:08.420
-Protect her.
-From what?

22:08.420 --> 22:13.340
This dangerous band of marauders and thieves who may
have broken into her place and stolen,what,a kiss?

22:13.850 --> 22:16.540
What are you so hot about?
You don't even know this lady?

22:16.540 --> 22:18.460
Didn't you just tell me
you met her ten minutes ago?

22:18.460 --> 22:21.810
I know what she's
telling us is true-- I saw it.

22:21.810 --> 22:23.580
Oh,you were there?

22:26.980 --> 22:29.190
And I saw something else,too.

22:29.190 --> 22:33.180
A man who's serving a life sentence
for a murder that i don't think he did,

22:33.180 --> 22:34.990
he was the person
doing the kissing.

22:34.990 --> 22:37.440
You're not making much sense,
if the guy's still in prison.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.030
I know,it doesn't make
a lot of sense to me either.

22:45.980 --> 22:48.170
What do you want me
to do,allison?

22:53.060 --> 22:56.710
ms. Walsh...you ever heard
of a man named sam elkin?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.400
No. Doesn't ring a bell. Why?

23:01.140 --> 23:03.210
Uh,never mind. No big deal.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.300
I've conferred with mrs. Dubois here

23:05.300 --> 23:09.750
and we've decided to post a visible
police presence right outside your building.

23:09.750 --> 23:13.830
They'll be there 24 hours a day,
and if anyone comes in or out,they'll see it.

23:13.830 --> 23:16.990
Additionally,we'll set up
a direct phone link to your apartment.

23:17.420 --> 23:20.000
If anyone does come in,
you just pick up that phone and we're there.

23:21.570 --> 23:23.240
Wow. That's great.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.970
I was just hoping that maybe you could
send someone over to take a second look.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.480
Really?

23:31.390 --> 23:33.310
I wouldn't hear of it.

23:33.310 --> 23:36.170
This kissing thing,
that's not something i want to play around with.

23:36.170 --> 23:37.970
Well,thank you.

23:40.530 --> 23:42.450
And thank you,mrs. Dubois.

23:42.450 --> 23:45.630
Oh,no,it's nothing.
That's what we're here for.

23:45.630 --> 23:48.520
Absolutely.
That is what we're here for.

23:54.260 --> 23:55.610
Hello?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.140
Hello?

24:00.690 --> 24:02.830
Are you here?

24:05.520 --> 24:07.720
Are you watching me?

24:11.610 --> 24:12.940
hey.

24:13.910 --> 24:17.220
You're home,
and it's not even 12:00.

24:19.270 --> 24:21.700
Will wonders never cease?

24:21.700 --> 24:24.620
you'd almost think
that I lived here.

24:28.790 --> 24:30.610
I missed you.

24:30.860 --> 24:35.750
I hate waking up and having dreams
and not having you to share them with.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.970
Well,good.

24:37.970 --> 24:40.830
Because I suspect
that pretty soon,

24:41.500 --> 24:44.380
not only will i be around during the
middle of the night,

24:44.380 --> 24:47.600
but quite possibly
during the day,as well.

24:48.770 --> 24:50.560
What are you talking about?

24:50.560 --> 24:53.190
Well,we went to
see the client today,

24:53.190 --> 24:56.050
and it's like
i was invisible.

24:56.050 --> 24:58.790
Nobody really wanted
to hear from me.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.790
It was the edrick show.
All day,all the time.

25:05.230 --> 25:08.030
You know,the guy's been an
engineer for 15 minutes,

25:08.030 --> 25:11.510
but it's like he's galileo the way they
hang on his every word.

25:12.450 --> 25:13.540
Honey...

25:13.540 --> 25:15.410
and not just...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.150
not just the client,

25:19.150 --> 25:22.700
but the senior guys
from our frm,as well.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.770
I know thaok.

25:24.770 --> 25:26.780
I used to get
that look.

25:26.780 --> 25:29.950
That's the "you're the
future of this company" look.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.540
Hmm,I think you're exaggerating.
I met edrick.

25:33.540 --> 25:36.520
He bows at your feet.
He worships you.

25:36.520 --> 25:39.080
He's got me lined up
in his crosshairs.

25:39.890 --> 25:42.310
he covets my
parking space.

25:42.870 --> 25:47.920
He lusts after the senior
vice president nameplate on my office door.

25:49.150 --> 25:52.440
He pines for my four extra
vacation days a year.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.880
And you know what the
surprising part is

26:00.200 --> 26:02.720
I don't think i
really give a damn.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.200
It's good to be home.

26:10.430 --> 26:11.890
And you?

26:11.890 --> 26:14.060
Any more kissing dreams?

26:14.500 --> 26:17.900
Mm,the kissing has stopped.
There is no kissing.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.210
No real clarity,either.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.540
interview elkin again?

26:40.080 --> 26:42.490
-Whatever for?
-I've been having these dreams.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.080
Allison...

26:44.930 --> 26:47.010
all of them are very similar.

26:47.010 --> 26:51.040
Up until last night,I thought they were
about this blind woman,kathleen walsh,

26:51.040 --> 26:55.120
being kissed by a man who has no features,
being kissed by sam elkin.

26:55.850 --> 26:58.900
But then last night,
I had the same dream,

26:58.900 --> 27:02.980
set in the same place,
but kathleen is gone.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.880
Elkin's dead girlfriend,
amanda crane,is in her place.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.400
And this suggests?

27:09.400 --> 27:11.760
I don't know,but I'd like
to try and find out.

27:13.740 --> 27:16.640
I don't have it,
and I couldn't do it.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.690
I left here at 10:30 last night.

27:19.690 --> 27:23.560
No matter how much I try,
I can't design with my eyes closed.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.820
The drawings,the silicone diode--
I don't have them,I'm still working on them.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.140
Sorry,kid.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.320
I need your help.

27:35.410 --> 27:36.970
Excuse me?

27:36.970 --> 27:38.200
All my work.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.930
I sent it down to qc,
double-check the specs.

27:42.670 --> 27:44.800
None of it checked out.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.700
The quality control guys
called it gibberish.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.810
It's only a matter of time
before everyone upstairs hears about it.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.350
I need your help,mr. Dubois.

28:20.470 --> 28:21.860
so what'd I do?

28:21.860 --> 28:24.150
Well,that's what I was hoping
to figure out.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.710
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's allison dubois.

28:28.710 --> 28:30.830
I work with
the district attorney's office.

28:30.830 --> 28:34.820
I was here for your parole hearing the
other day. Sat right over there.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.580
You waiting for a thank you?

28:39.510 --> 28:41.860
It's gonna be a long wait.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.350
Well,no,I'm not here
for a thank you.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.820
I'd just like
to get some questions answered.

28:49.820 --> 28:53.090
Well,I don't know.
Depends on the questions.

28:53.550 --> 28:55.750
I mean,what's in it for me?

28:56.300 --> 28:59.120
Looks like I'm gonna be in here
the rest of my life.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.250
I'm not what you'd call
highly incentivized.

29:02.660 --> 29:05.310
Okay,well,let's start
with an easy one then.

29:05.310 --> 29:08.340
Why did you sit
there the other day

29:08.340 --> 29:11.480
and plead forgiveness
for a crime that you didn't commit?

29:13.610 --> 29:15.990
I mean,I know your
lawyer must have told you

29:15.990 --> 29:20.910
your only chance of parole was for you to come in and
sit there and tell the board what they wanted to hear,

29:21.510 --> 29:23.920
but I'm here to tell you,

29:23.920 --> 29:28.380
I strongly suspect that you
did not commit that crime.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.650
Now,I'm not on the board,and I'm with
the district attorney's office,

29:32.650 --> 29:36.470
but I'm no attorney,
so I can't really promise you anything.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.710
But if you have a story to tell,

29:39.710 --> 29:42.310
I would like to hear it.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.610
And if I believe you,

29:45.340 --> 29:49.440
I will do everything I can
to be sure that everyone listens.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.480
I loved amanda crane.

29:57.710 --> 30:01.170
She was a college girl,
I was a guy who fixed cars.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.690
Her friends didn't think
much of me.

30:04.690 --> 30:07.010
Her family didn't think
much of me.

30:07.010 --> 30:09.150
But I loved her.

30:09.700 --> 30:12.260
We went together for months.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.630
Used to spend almost
every day together.

30:16.370 --> 30:19.190
Every day except tuesdays.

30:20.260 --> 30:23.010
At first,she was always
coming up with excuses.

30:23.010 --> 30:26.180
I have a test,
I have a paper due.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.170
Then she switched her story
on me.

30:29.170 --> 30:32.410
Said she had a job,
she had to work.

30:32.980 --> 30:35.090
Didn't really bother me
at first.

30:35.090 --> 30:37.490
Didn't think much of it.

30:37.930 --> 30:41.890
Then I lost my wallet one night,
had no money to get home.

30:41.890 --> 30:45.680
I went over to her dorm,
she wasn't there.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.220
It was:00 in the morning.

30:48.220 --> 30:51.390
Next day she tells me
she was working all night.

30:51.390 --> 30:53.900
"Doing what?" I said.

30:54.630 --> 30:57.280
That's when things started
to get strange.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.730
For a while,she wouldn't tell me,
but I wouldn't let it go.

31:02.530 --> 31:05.170
I was like a dog with a bone.

31:05.690 --> 31:08.410
Finally,one night,
she tells me.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.340
She met a man.

31:12.820 --> 31:15.640
He offered to pay her way
through school.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.730
All she had to do was go over
to this apartment he owned.

31:18.730 --> 31:22.840
When she gets inside,
she puts on a blindfold,spends the night.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.540
-And do what?
-Exactly.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.600
That's what I wanted to know.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.070
She swears to me,
she's not doing anything.

31:30.070 --> 31:34.930
She just puts on a blindfold,takes off
her clothes,puts on a nightgown,goes to bed.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.370
Got up the next morning,

31:37.370 --> 31:41.840
put her clothes back on,took the
blindfold off,and walked out the door.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.190
And that was it?

31:45.890 --> 31:48.080
So she said.

31:49.790 --> 31:51.570
I asked her if he was there.

31:51.570 --> 31:54.360
She said she supposed so,
but she never heard him,

31:54.360 --> 31:58.490
never felt him,
never sensed he was there.

31:59.310 --> 32:01.980
I didn't believe her at first.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.750
I used to drop her off a couple of
blocks away.She'd let me use the car.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.010
Then one night,I followed her.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.260
She caught me
before she got there.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.260
She was furious.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.940
We had a huge fight,
broke up.

32:21.390 --> 32:23.580
I'd call her,
she wouldn't answer.

32:23.580 --> 32:26.780
I'd go over to her dorm,
she wouldn't let me in.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.790
That's when she got
the restraining order.

32:31.870 --> 32:34.940
I stayed away
for a month,

32:35.660 --> 32:37.870
but then I couldn't
take it any longer.

32:37.870 --> 32:40.270
I went over to her dorm.

32:40.270 --> 32:42.190
damn near busted the door down.

32:42.190 --> 32:46.220
Her roommate threatened to call the cops,
but amanda finally let me in.

32:46.870 --> 32:51.140
Roommate took off,
and we had another huge fight

32:52.290 --> 32:54.640
and then,a huge cry...

32:56.460 --> 32:59.140
and then,we made love.

33:02.360 --> 33:05.370
I told her I was going to find
a way to pay for school.

33:05.370 --> 33:07.820
I was going to do it.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.540
She told me she loved me,
she missed me.

33:12.070 --> 33:16.030
She was going to quit.She was going to
find a way to tell that guy that night.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.160
That was the last time
i saw her.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.180
Next thing I know,they found
her car at that car wash.

33:29.730 --> 33:34.070
My dna was everywhere.
It was inside the car,inside her.

33:35.890 --> 33:38.850
I told them my story,
but no one believed me.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.580
Ma'am?

33:43.080 --> 33:45.150
What are you thinking?

33:45.150 --> 33:48.650
I was thinking,have you
ever met kathleen walsh?

33:49.330 --> 33:52.160
No,I don't think so.
What does she look like?

33:53.800 --> 33:57.500
I'm thinking she looks a lot
like this guy's next victim.

33:59.810 --> 34:02.180
so what you are saying is that
there's this man

34:02.180 --> 34:04.440
who likes to watch women sleep?

34:04.440 --> 34:07.200
I'm not going to even pretend
to know what he likes.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.730
You think this is the guy who's been sneaking
into your friend kathleen's apartment?

34:10.730 --> 34:12.880
Well,she's not my friend,
but yes,

34:12.880 --> 34:17.210
what I'm saying is i feel very strongly the man
who's been watching kathleen is the same man

34:17.210 --> 34:19.800
who was watching elkin's
girlfriend,amanda,

34:19.800 --> 34:22.409
and very well may have been
responsible for her death.

34:22.409 --> 34:26.610
You know,when I was preparing for elkin's
parole hearing,I remember reading his statement.

34:26.610 --> 34:29.960
This crazy story about
his girlfriend having a job,

34:29.960 --> 34:32.710
only he didn't know where,
and he didn't know with whom.

34:32.710 --> 34:35.080
-I know,it sounds so bizarre.
-Bizarre?

34:35.610 --> 34:38.280
no,it aspires to "bizarre."

34:39.590 --> 34:43.310
allison,this man's sperm was still
inside her when they found the body.

34:43.310 --> 34:47.510
Yeah,they made up the night before.
He went by her dorm.Her roommate saw him.

34:47.510 --> 34:50.909
Precisely,he was in violation of the restraining
order she took out against him.

34:50.909 --> 34:54.989
Not exactly the kind of thing you want to put
in front of a judge in hopes of reopening a case.

34:55.610 --> 34:57.520
What if we could catch him?

34:57.520 --> 34:58.980
You lost me.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.300
Well,we know he likes kathleen.

35:01.300 --> 35:05.130
So what if we can remove
the visible police presence outside the building--

35:05.580 --> 35:07.940
the squad car,
the patrolman?

35:07.940 --> 35:10.590
Are you suggesting
that we use this woman as bait?

35:11.470 --> 35:15.570
We might be able to do it safely.Wire the place up
so we could hear everything,hide a bunch of swat guys.

35:15.570 --> 35:19.520
We're already providing round-
the-clock police protection against an intruder

35:19.520 --> 35:22.020
i'm not convinced even exists!

35:22.020 --> 35:25.240
Now we're talking about spending
more of the taxpayer's money to catch someone

35:25.240 --> 35:27.880
you think might have committed
a five-year-old murder,

35:27.880 --> 35:30.190
for which we already have
someone in prison?

35:30.400 --> 35:32.240
Doesn't matter-- won't
work unless kathleen walsh

35:32.240 --> 35:36.210
agrees to stay in that apartment without a
police car standing watch outside her building.

35:37.830 --> 35:40.890
Which I'm guessing might
be a tough sell.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.470
Well,can't we
at least ask her?

35:45.900 --> 35:48.980
It's 11 minutes past 8:00.
She might not have left for work yet.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.750
It's up to y.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.130
hello.

35:59.130 --> 36:01.910
Ms. Walsh,this is
district attorney devalos.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.700
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning,

36:04.700 --> 36:07.320
but we think we may have
developed a significant lead in your case,

36:07.320 --> 36:12.020
and I was wondering if I might be able to
persuade you to let us pull the police presence

36:12.020 --> 36:16.360
in front of your building for several nights
in hopes of drawing the suspect out.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.490
Obviously,we would install
other safety measures.

36:19.490 --> 36:23.080
Last night was the first
good night's sleep i've had in months.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.050
I can't tell you what it was like to get
into bed and know I was alone.

36:27.690 --> 36:29.760
Know I was alone.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.220
-Hey,where you going?
-I got to call scanlon.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.370
-yeah.
-He's in the apartment.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.170
Allison?

36:46.170 --> 36:48.360
I don't know how he got
in there,but...

36:48.360 --> 36:50.350
are you talking
about kathleen walsh's place?

36:50.350 --> 36:53.320
I got a cop and a cop car
sitting in front of her building,trust me.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.720
I'm telling you,
he can get past them.

36:55.720 --> 36:59.800
We changed the locks on every door,
and checked the latches on all her windows.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.350
It doesn't matter.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.770
Allison,what you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

37:03.770 --> 37:07.300
Please! You have a man right there.
Can't you send him up?

37:07.910 --> 37:10.230
It's 2:00 in the morning,
allison.

37:10.230 --> 37:12.160
Lee!

37:12.660 --> 37:15.330
All right,I'll send someone up there.
I'll call you right back.

37:19.530 --> 37:24.280
I'm not sure how I feel about you calling
strange men at 2:00 in the morning.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.990
I'm worried,joe.
I got a bad feeling.

37:28.810 --> 37:30.820
That's good enough for me.

37:33.140 --> 37:35.900
You were right about edrick,
by the way.

37:35.900 --> 37:39.460
What do you mean?
Did he fall to his knees,beg for mercy?

37:39.940 --> 37:42.190
Pretty damn close.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.680
Two officers went up,allison.
They checked the whole place.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.290
No one was in there,
and no one was getting in there,

37:50.290 --> 37:52.770
I mean,except for one fairly
cheesed-off blind lady,

37:52.770 --> 37:56.050
who said she was enjoying
the best night's sleep she'd had in months.

37:56.050 --> 37:57.600
Really?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.690
But I don't understand.

37:59.690 --> 38:02.500
No offense,allison,
but it's 2:00 in the morning.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.430
you,me,and devalos are
supposed to meet at 8:00 A.M.

38:05.430 --> 38:07.760
Would it be okay
if we chatted then?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.380
Sure.

38:10.890 --> 38:13.810
Now you're suggesting
we use this woman as bait?

38:14.350 --> 38:18.300
Well,we know he likes kathleen,
so maybe we could

38:18.300 --> 38:21.280
remove some of the visible police
presence around the building--

38:21.630 --> 38:25.070
the car sitting there,
the patrolman?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.370
Okay...

38:31.370 --> 38:33.320
what do you want me to say?

38:33.890 --> 38:38.750
Well,I don't know.Last night,I convinced
myself that you thought it was a good idea.

38:39.530 --> 38:42.320
Well... I don't know
what to tell you.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.340
Allison,be realistic.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.890
After you convinced
detective scanlon

38:47.890 --> 38:51.580
to send the police charging into this
woman's apartment at 2:00 in the morning,

38:51.580 --> 38:56.250
the other tenants in the building,
who are already up in arms about being stopped

38:56.250 --> 38:59.030
every time they come in and go
out,have had it up to here.

38:59.030 --> 39:02.410
Not to mention what it's costing the department
keeping personnel there 24-7.

39:02.410 --> 39:04.130
I think we have to pull
the plug on this thing.

39:04.130 --> 39:06.900
But,sir,that man was there!
I saw him--

39:06.900 --> 39:09.020
we were here
having a meeting like this...

39:09.020 --> 39:10.350
allison...

39:10.350 --> 39:13.610
I have enormous respect for you,
but it's 8:10,

39:13.610 --> 39:16.760
and I'm due in the judge's chambers
in 20 minutes.

39:17.570 --> 39:19.390
8:10?

39:20.510 --> 39:23.310
Last night,
you said it was 8:11.

39:24.380 --> 39:26.990
Last night?
What are you talking about?

39:30.790 --> 39:33.260
Hey,I need to use your phone.

39:37.850 --> 39:39.100
hello.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.880
Kathleen,it's allison.

39:40.880 --> 39:45.030
Are you standing in your kitchen wearing your
bathrobe holding a cup of hot coffee?

39:45.030 --> 39:46.550
Well,no.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.450
Now I'm making my way
into the living room,

39:48.450 --> 39:51.660
wearing my bathrobe,
holding a cup of hot coffee.

39:51.660 --> 39:55.520
Kathleen,I need you to stay calm
and do exactly as I say.

39:56.340 --> 39:59.670
Take that hot coffee you're holding
and throw it over your right shoulder.

39:59.670 --> 40:04.540
This is detective scanlon.I need you to get up there
now.Enter kathleen walsh's apartment,weapons drawn.

40:07.810 --> 40:10.570
Kathleen,do it now--
he's right behind you!

40:13.070 --> 40:15.800
Mom,don't be ridiculous.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.250
no!

40:33.960 --> 40:36.980
Police! Release that woman,
and put your hands in the air!

40:44.870 --> 40:46.620
we got him,then you're right.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.600
I want to thank you
for your bravery.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.940
And I would also like to apologize for the
initial skepticism that came from this office.

40:55.940 --> 40:58.320
Apology accepted.

40:58.740 --> 41:01.670
Turns out your tormentor
was also your neighbor.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.930
It seems your apartment and his
were originally designed as a single unit.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.960
Mr. Christopher russo and his mother
lived there until the early '90s,

41:09.960 --> 41:13.910
when his mother passed on,
and he decided to turn it into two apartments.

41:13.910 --> 41:17.040
Your living room closet shares a common wall
with one in his bedroom.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.000
He finally confessed to everything
last night from his hospital bed.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.610
He hired amanda crane
five years ago.

41:22.610 --> 41:26.040
When she told him that the arrangement
no longer worked for her,

41:26.320 --> 41:28.490
he told her he had
pictures of her.

41:28.490 --> 41:32.270
She threatened to call the police.
They fought; he strangled her.

41:32.270 --> 41:35.240
He claims to have been
so horrified by the act of killing amanda,

41:35.240 --> 41:39.680
that he completely swore off
having anything to do with the opposite sex.

41:39.680 --> 41:43.890
Started renting the apartment
and completely forgot about the common closet.

41:43.890 --> 41:48.270
Then,you came along,a beautiful tenant
with a built-in blindfold,

41:48.760 --> 41:51.300
and his old compulsions
just took over.

41:51.300 --> 41:54.320
Well,I'm just happy to know
he's behind bars.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.900
Which reminds me,there is someone
who would very much like to meet you.

42:09.170 --> 42:10.610
Kathleen.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.370
This is sam elkin.

42:15.230 --> 42:17.530
It's very nice to meet you.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.270
Nice to meet you,sam.

42:22.570 --> 42:26.540
I've never slept with an executive senior
vice president before.

42:26.540 --> 42:29.950
Five extra vacation
days a year.

42:30.980 --> 42:32.920
Very impressive.

42:33.530 --> 42:36.370
So what did edrick
have to say about it?

42:41.180 --> 42:44.700
He was upset,but
i explained to him,

42:44.700 --> 42:50.050
with age comes experience,
and with experience comes wisdom.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.990
And what comes with wisdom?
