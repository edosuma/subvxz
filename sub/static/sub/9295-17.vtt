00:13.284 --> 00:16.081
Can I assume there is no change

00:16.143 --> 00:18.106
in the status
of President Hassan?

00:18.170 --> 00:19.301
I'm afraid not.

00:19.369 --> 00:21.599
Then he is still being
held by terrorists.

00:21.666 --> 00:23.764
If Hassan dies,

00:23.832 --> 00:25.097
there is no treaty.

00:25.163 --> 00:26.429
If I didn't know better,

00:26.496 --> 00:28.427
I'd think you were hoping
for that to happen.

00:28.495 --> 00:30.625
Jack thinks that someone inside
of CTU is working

00:30.693 --> 00:31.859
for the terrorists.

00:31.927 --> 00:34.224
Jack recovered Tarin's
cell phone from the crash.

00:34.292 --> 00:35.758
If someone did call
and tip him off,

00:35.826 --> 00:37.358
we can get the number off
the memory.

00:37.425 --> 00:39.089
It's Dana's phone.

00:39.157 --> 00:40.855
spoke to Hastings.

00:40.923 --> 00:42.619
He cleared me through.

00:44.452 --> 00:45.348
Stay where you are

00:45.416 --> 00:46.947
and keep your hands
where I can...

00:47.014 --> 00:49.947
She just entered
the parking garage.

00:54.746 --> 00:57.180
The only reason you've got
any leverage right now is

00:57.248 --> 00:58.848
because President Hassan
is alive.

00:58.915 --> 01:00.815
So stop screwing with me!

01:00.883 --> 01:03.313
They are gonna force him
to make a statement,

01:03.381 --> 01:05.579
and then they're going
to kill him.

01:05.646 --> 01:07.708
Just read the statement,
no more.

01:10.007 --> 01:11.406
You will renounce
the peace agreement.

01:11.474 --> 01:13.641
I will never do that.

01:13.709 --> 01:15.643
He's stronger than we thought.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.074
Bury him.

01:17.142 --> 01:19.039
I will tell the world
of his crimes.

01:19.107 --> 01:20.873
This man is not our president!

01:20.941 --> 01:22.274
He's an arrogant...

01:22.342 --> 01:23.808
Jack, looks like Samir's
grabbed him.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.975
We need you to get in there
right now!

01:26.041 --> 01:27.540
I have a visual on Hassan.

01:27.608 --> 01:28.975
Ready to engage.

01:41.445 --> 01:42.843
I'm sorry.

02:03.576 --> 02:04.776
Yes?

02:04.844 --> 02:05.876
Excuse me, ma'am.

02:05.944 --> 02:07.777
I have Jack Bauer
on the line for you.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.443
Put him through.

02:11.412 --> 02:12.679
Jack...

02:12.747 --> 02:14.947
Madam President,
I don't know what to say

02:15.014 --> 02:17.415
except that I'm sorry.

02:17.482 --> 02:19.349
I trust there was nothing

02:19.417 --> 02:21.684
you and your team
could have done differently.

02:21.752 --> 02:23.618
No, ma'am.

02:23.686 --> 02:27.820
President Hassan was dead
before we even got there.

02:27.888 --> 02:30.187
Then you don't owe me
an apology.

02:30.255 --> 02:32.488
I failed you, ma'am.

02:32.556 --> 02:35.690
It was Hassan's choice
to surrender himself

02:35.757 --> 02:37.457
in order to save
American lives.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.592
It was out of your hands.

02:39.659 --> 02:43.260
Don't put this responsibility
on yourself.

02:43.327 --> 02:47.495
Madam President, you need to
keep this peace agreement alive.

02:47.563 --> 02:49.229
There can't be any agreement

02:49.297 --> 02:51.597
when the IRK is
without a leader, Jack.

02:51.665 --> 02:54.465
The hardliners there will take
advantage of the vacuum

02:54.533 --> 02:56.967
and-and reverse all the progress
we made with Hassan.

02:57.034 --> 02:59.601
I'm gonna have
to address the delegates

02:59.669 --> 03:02.035
in a few minutes
and announce the dissolution

03:02.103 --> 03:04.537
of the peace summit,
and, and formally release them.

03:04.605 --> 03:06.571
Ma'am, if you give up,
it means they win.

03:06.639 --> 03:08.873
I don't see another choice,
Jack.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.474
I-I wish to God I did.

03:13.742 --> 03:14.909
Good-bye, Jack.

03:23.816 --> 03:25.148
What's his condition?

03:25.216 --> 03:27.350
He took a round to the shoulder,
another through the abdomen,

03:27.418 --> 03:28.717
but it exited clean.

03:28.785 --> 03:30.752
BP looks steady.
Look, we need this guy for questioning.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.920
Is he going to make it or not?
Doesn't look like

03:32.988 --> 03:34.688
any vitals were hit.
He'll live. All right.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.456
We'll transport him back to CTU.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.524
Medical will take him for now.

04:17.827 --> 04:19.228
Jack.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.332
President Taylor is going
to formally announce

04:26.400 --> 04:27.832
the end of the
peace conference.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.701
Jack, you did everything
you could.

04:33.769 --> 04:35.769
It wasn't enough.

04:37.571 --> 04:39.339
We should get back to CTU.

04:39.407 --> 04:41.074
Why?

04:41.142 --> 04:42.508
The fuel rods
have been recovered.

04:42.609 --> 04:44.177
The peace conference is over.

04:44.245 --> 04:47.513
Everybody who was responsible
is either dead or in custody.

04:51.618 --> 04:53.619
Cole.

04:55.187 --> 04:56.854
What's the status on Samir?

04:56.922 --> 04:59.289
He's still unconscious,
but the EMTs say he'll make it.

04:59.357 --> 05:01.191
Okay, good.
I want you to stay with him.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.392
I'm handing over
complete authority

05:02.460 --> 05:04.127
and responsibility
for his transport to you.

05:04.195 --> 05:05.595
Are you heading back to CTU?

05:05.663 --> 05:06.764
No.

05:06.832 --> 05:08.433
We're going home. We're done.

05:08.501 --> 05:10.534
Hastings is still
probably going to want

05:10.602 --> 05:11.902
to debrief both of you.

05:11.969 --> 05:13.903
I'm sure he will.
He knows how to find me.

05:13.971 --> 05:16.906
I'm sorry it ended up
like this, Jack.

05:16.974 --> 05:19.242
Me, too.

05:19.310 --> 05:20.876
You're a good Agent, Cole.

05:20.944 --> 05:22.511
I wouldn't be standing here
without you.

05:22.578 --> 05:23.745
Thank you.

05:23.813 --> 05:25.013
I hope everything works out.

05:25.081 --> 05:26.815
I'll pack my kit up downstairs.

05:35.055 --> 05:36.589
Madam President.

05:36.657 --> 05:40.459
The delegates are assembled
in the lounge, as you requested.

05:42.394 --> 05:44.595
Let's get this over with.

05:47.064 --> 05:49.632
Discontinue the peace summit that was to be

05:49.699 --> 05:51.400
a cornerstone
of her administration.

05:51.468 --> 05:54.506
President Hassan apparently
had been kidnapped earlier,

05:54.574 --> 05:55.943
and then taken to...

05:56.011 --> 05:57.946
Jamot.

05:58.014 --> 05:59.814
On behalf of my country,

05:59.882 --> 06:03.314
you have our deepest sympathy
for this terrible tragedy.

06:03.382 --> 06:05.115
Though, on a personal level,

06:05.183 --> 06:07.584
I imagine you
have mixed feelings right now.

06:07.652 --> 06:09.252
Beg your pardon?

06:09.320 --> 06:11.121
Hassan had you arrested
without cause

06:11.188 --> 06:12.855
during his purge
of suspected enemies.

06:12.923 --> 06:15.725
Allowed you to be
brutally interrogated.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.259
I would think you
have little love for the man.

06:18.327 --> 06:21.028
President Hassan
was under tremendous duress,

06:21.096 --> 06:22.563
and he lost his way,

06:22.631 --> 06:25.532
but I never stopped believing
in what he stood for.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.533
Of course.

06:26.601 --> 06:27.901
I meant no offense.

06:27.968 --> 06:29.468
I'm sure you didn't.

06:29.536 --> 06:31.035
Excuse me.

06:32.404 --> 06:33.704
While we have not learned
the identity

06:33.772 --> 06:35.306
of the terrorist in the video...

06:38.376 --> 06:40.209
President Taylor.

06:40.277 --> 06:42.145
Minister Jamot.

06:42.212 --> 06:44.947
If you can spare a few moments,
I need to speak with you.

06:45.014 --> 06:46.849
I will be happy
to sit down with you

06:46.916 --> 06:48.983
after I have addressed
the other delegations.

06:49.051 --> 06:50.285
I know you're intending
to announce

06:50.352 --> 06:51.719
the end of the peace summit,

06:51.787 --> 06:53.988
but there may be a way
to prevent that from happening.

06:54.055 --> 06:55.622
Before you do anything,

06:55.690 --> 06:58.024
I need you to hear
what I have to say.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.260
All right.

07:01.328 --> 07:03.462
Ma'am, what about the delegates?

07:03.530 --> 07:04.763
Just... just give me a moment.

07:04.831 --> 07:06.498
Let's go in here.

07:06.566 --> 07:08.197
Please.

07:09.935 --> 07:11.535
Federal agents mounted
an operation

07:11.603 --> 07:13.971
to rescue President Hassan
from the terrorists

07:14.038 --> 07:16.206
that commenced
approximately 30 minutes ago.

07:16.273 --> 07:17.841
Yes?

07:17.908 --> 07:21.677
Samir's men were all dead,
thanks to the Americans.

07:21.744 --> 07:27.147
Samir was the only one left,
but I took care of him.

07:27.215 --> 07:28.816
So, there's no connection to us?

07:28.883 --> 07:30.050
We're in the clear?

07:30.118 --> 07:31.885
Maybe not.

07:31.953 --> 07:35.522
There was a woman there
who might have recognized me.

07:35.590 --> 07:36.990
What woman?

07:37.058 --> 07:40.060
She may be CTU...
I'm not sure... but...

07:40.127 --> 07:42.095
I've seen her face before.

07:42.163 --> 07:43.163
Where?

07:43.231 --> 07:45.298
Six years ago,
when we were using

07:45.366 --> 07:47.700
that mobster,
Vladimir Laitanan,

07:47.768 --> 07:50.670
to smuggle military weapons
out of the country,

07:50.738 --> 07:52.338
she was with him.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.340
Are you sure it was her?

07:54.408 --> 07:56.976
I don't forget faces.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.444
Where is she now?

07:58.512 --> 07:59.879
In a taxicab,

07:59.946 --> 08:03.712
just ahead of me,
with Jack Bauer.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.546
Bauer?

08:05.614 --> 08:07.548
Are they going to CTU?

08:07.615 --> 08:09.549
I don't think so, no.

08:09.617 --> 08:12.084
Then, it seems unlikely
she recognized you.

08:12.152 --> 08:15.454
Better not to take the chance.

08:15.522 --> 08:18.190
I'll take out Bauer, too,
while I'm at it.

08:18.258 --> 08:20.559
The Americans believe the IRK

08:20.627 --> 08:22.695
were solely behind
the recent attacks.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.931
Killing Bauer and this woman
would only alert them

08:24.999 --> 08:26.835
to the fact that others
were involved.

08:26.902 --> 08:29.606
How long before they
discover that it was us?

08:29.673 --> 08:31.540
It will take even less time

08:31.608 --> 08:33.774
if this woman remembers me.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.510
What are my orders?

08:38.578 --> 08:41.614
Continue to follow them...
keep them in sight...

08:41.682 --> 08:43.815
And I'll get back to you.

09:10.934 --> 09:12.735
I don't have the words

09:12.803 --> 09:16.138
to tell you and Kayla
how sorry I am.

09:17.941 --> 09:20.811
I know you did everything
in your power.

09:23.881 --> 09:26.115
Jamot, I wasn't aware
that you were here.

09:26.183 --> 09:29.150
I only arrived a short time ago.

09:29.218 --> 09:31.185
I want you to know that,

09:31.253 --> 09:33.420
in our last few hours together,

09:33.487 --> 09:35.555
Omar expressed
his regrets to me,

09:35.622 --> 09:38.691
not the least of which
was his treatment of you.

09:38.758 --> 09:41.827
I appreciate that.

09:41.895 --> 09:45.564
Mrs. Hassan, I realize
our timing is intrusive,

09:45.632 --> 09:48.600
but there's something we need
to discuss privately.

09:48.668 --> 09:50.203
Did you find him,
President Taylor?

09:50.271 --> 09:52.138
The man who killed my father?

09:52.205 --> 09:53.772
Samir Mehran.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.240
Yes.

09:55.308 --> 09:57.942
He was badly wounded,
but he'll live to stand trial.

09:58.010 --> 10:02.013
And, believe me, he will pay
dearly for what he's done.

10:02.081 --> 10:03.481
Kayla, darling,

10:03.549 --> 10:06.083
I need to speak
with President Taylor alone.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.151
Give us a few minutes.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.361
What is it that you wish
to talk to me about?

10:21.429 --> 10:22.529
Mrs. Hassan, as you know,

10:22.596 --> 10:24.296
for almost a year,
your husband and I

10:24.364 --> 10:26.998
worked to make this
peace agreement a reality.

10:27.066 --> 10:29.800
Now, in that time,
I saw the kind

10:29.868 --> 10:31.768
of leader he was.

10:31.836 --> 10:33.403
He managed
against difficult odds

10:33.470 --> 10:35.271
to bring a fractious
and contentious

10:35.338 --> 10:37.038
parliament together.

10:37.106 --> 10:38.806
But, now that he's gone,

10:38.874 --> 10:41.875
your country is going
to be thrown into turmoil.

10:41.943 --> 10:44.310
I am aware of the challenges
that we are facing.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.645
Why are you telling me this?

10:46.713 --> 10:49.413
Clearly, someone needs
to take the reigns

10:49.481 --> 10:51.583
of the IRK government.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.958
Someone who believes
in the same ideals

10:54.026 --> 10:56.164
and principles as Omar Hassan,

10:56.232 --> 10:58.433
and who shares his strength.

10:58.501 --> 10:59.934
Minister Jamot

11:00.002 --> 11:01.669
believes that that person

11:01.737 --> 11:03.604
should be you.

11:03.672 --> 11:05.806
What?!

11:05.873 --> 11:08.007
I'm not the only one
who believes it.

11:08.075 --> 11:09.208
I've spoken to our delegation,

11:09.276 --> 11:10.910
as well as
with the other members

11:10.977 --> 11:12.144
of our cabinet back home.

11:12.212 --> 11:14.612
You represent our best.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.247
Our only real chance

11:16.315 --> 11:17.448
to preserve our government

11:17.516 --> 11:19.484
and your husband's agenda.

11:19.552 --> 11:21.385
You are out of your mind!

11:21.453 --> 11:23.988
I am no politician.

11:24.055 --> 11:26.024
But you are a martyr's wife.

11:26.091 --> 11:28.193
And history has proven that

11:28.260 --> 11:30.194
to be something
far more powerful.

11:30.262 --> 11:32.796
You have always been popular
with the people.

11:32.864 --> 11:35.532
The vast majority
of them want peace.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.434
They will rally around you.

11:37.502 --> 11:39.570
The Council of Guardian
will have no choice

11:39.637 --> 11:42.639
but to recognize you
as successor to the presidency.

11:42.707 --> 11:44.708
But I have a choice.

11:45.744 --> 11:47.045
You assume too much of me,

11:47.112 --> 11:49.180
Jamot.

11:55.053 --> 11:58.422
I realize that
this is a lot to consider,

11:58.489 --> 12:01.925
especially now while
you're grieving,

12:01.993 --> 12:05.262
but without a unifying figure
to hold your country together,

12:05.329 --> 12:09.732
everything your husband
worked for will be for nothing.

12:16.507 --> 12:20.309
President Taylor, my marriage
to Omar was far from perfect.

12:20.377 --> 12:24.379
We had many problems
for a very long time.

12:25.414 --> 12:27.414
I know only too well

12:27.482 --> 12:29.449
how difficult it is
for a marriage

12:29.517 --> 12:32.551
to survive a life in politics.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.987
But through it all,
I never stopped loving him.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.190
Or sharing his desire

12:38.258 --> 12:40.726
for better relations
with the West.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.635
If it is the will of my people

12:49.703 --> 12:52.805
and of my government,

12:52.873 --> 12:57.109
I will take my husband's place
at the peace conference.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.345
It will be my honor
to stand with you.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.380
We'll make the announcement
together

13:02.448 --> 13:04.384
from the United Nations.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.093
Mrs. Hassan,

13:07.160 --> 13:08.963
thank you.

13:21.109 --> 13:22.609
She's going to do it.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.578
Oh, that's incredible
news, Madam President.

13:24.646 --> 13:26.646
I want every delegate
contacted personally.

13:26.714 --> 13:29.115
Tell them to cancel any plans
to leave the country.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.817
We are returning to the UN.

13:30.884 --> 13:31.985
Yes, ma'am.

13:32.052 --> 13:33.219
I'll also call CTU

13:33.287 --> 13:34.654
and implement those changes
we discussed

13:34.722 --> 13:36.089
if I still have
your permission.

13:36.156 --> 13:37.690
That's your decision.

13:37.758 --> 13:39.258
Do what you think is best.

13:39.326 --> 13:40.726
Yes, ma'am.

13:44.431 --> 13:45.865
Where's Bauer?

13:45.932 --> 13:47.966
Jack left the scene,
took Renee with him.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.635
Hassan's death hit him
pretty hard.

13:49.702 --> 13:52.004
Samir's been taken to Medical
to get patched up.

13:52.071 --> 13:53.305
Is he conscious?
Barely.

13:53.373 --> 13:55.440
You let me know the second
he's ready for questioning.

13:55.508 --> 13:56.642
All right.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.909
Put him through.

13:58.944 --> 14:01.012
CTU. O'Brian.

14:01.079 --> 14:02.747
This is Tim Woods
with Homeland Security.

14:02.814 --> 14:04.983
Hold on. I'll put you through
to Mr. Hastings.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.686
Oh, no. Actually, I'm calling
to speak with you, Ms. O'Brian.

14:07.754 --> 14:09.388
Me? Are you sure?

14:09.456 --> 14:10.990
I know this is
an unusual circumstance,

14:11.057 --> 14:12.591
so I'll get straight
to the point.

14:12.659 --> 14:13.959
President Taylor
and the foreign dignitaries

14:14.026 --> 14:15.527
are returning to the UN shortly

14:15.594 --> 14:17.095
where the president
will announce her intent

14:17.163 --> 14:19.330
to move forward with the signing
of the peace agreement.

14:19.398 --> 14:20.632
Well, excuse me,

14:20.699 --> 14:22.934
but how can she do that
without President Hassan?

14:23.002 --> 14:24.869
I'm not at liberty
to say just yet,

14:24.937 --> 14:27.071
but our immediate concern
is whether CTU is capable

14:27.139 --> 14:29.673
of handling security
for the rest of the process.

14:29.741 --> 14:31.775
It's already been infiltrated
by an enemy Agent,

14:31.843 --> 14:33.210
compromised more
than once today.

14:33.278 --> 14:34.778
<i>We cannot have
any more mistakes.</i>

14:34.846 --> 14:36.079
Are you suggesting

14:36.147 --> 14:38.148
I'm responsible
for those mistakes?

14:38.215 --> 14:39.582
On the contrary.

14:39.650 --> 14:41.417
I reviewed the hourly reports,

14:41.485 --> 14:43.486
and from what I see,
you've made some astute calls,

14:43.554 --> 14:45.321
and have proven
to be very resourceful

14:45.389 --> 14:46.489
throughout this crisis.

14:46.557 --> 14:48.224
Okay.

14:48.292 --> 14:49.859
So why are you calling me?

14:51.261 --> 14:52.895
I'm relieving Brian Hastings
of his post

14:52.963 --> 14:54.897
effective immediately.

14:54.965 --> 14:56.198
We're now in the process

14:56.266 --> 14:58.033
of vetting suitable candidates
to replace him,

14:58.101 --> 15:01.236
but until we find someone,
you'll have provisional command.

15:01.304 --> 15:04.706
You're... You're putting me
in charge?

15:04.774 --> 15:06.542
For the time being.

15:06.609 --> 15:08.544
I know your record
at CTU's L.A. branch,

15:08.645 --> 15:10.546
and how important you were
during the Sangala crisis.

15:10.613 --> 15:11.680
There's nobody in that building

15:11.748 --> 15:13.348
that has more experience
than you do.

15:13.416 --> 15:14.650
Sir, you're making a mistake.

15:14.717 --> 15:15.951
What happened
with President Hassan,

15:16.019 --> 15:17.152
and everything else...

15:17.220 --> 15:18.854
It wasn't Mr. Hastings' fault.

15:18.921 --> 15:21.256
Chloe, I don't have time
to debate this with you.

15:21.324 --> 15:22.925
Division feels
you are the most qualified

15:22.992 --> 15:24.393
to step in, and I agree.

15:24.460 --> 15:25.560
My decision's made.

15:25.628 --> 15:27.396
Now accept it,
and let's move on.

15:27.463 --> 15:29.031
Does Mr. Hastings know?

15:29.098 --> 15:31.266
Division's informing him
as we speak.

15:32.702 --> 15:34.002
Just try to make the transition

15:34.070 --> 15:35.371
as quick and painless
as possible.

15:35.438 --> 15:36.539
I'll be in touch

15:36.606 --> 15:38.774
as soon as the president arrives
at the UN.

15:38.841 --> 15:40.776
Yes, sir.

15:58.297 --> 16:00.298
Come in.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.401
Mr. Hastings?

16:04.403 --> 16:06.836
It's okay, Chloe.

16:06.903 --> 16:09.005
I just want you to know,

16:09.072 --> 16:11.107
I don't think it's fair
what they're doing,

16:11.174 --> 16:12.508
laying all the blame on you.

16:14.544 --> 16:17.546
Everything that happens here
is my responsibility.

16:17.614 --> 16:20.049
The successes and the failures.

16:21.385 --> 16:24.854
I recruited Dana Walsh
into this agency,

16:24.922 --> 16:27.490
so I let the snake
into the garden.

16:34.631 --> 16:36.999
I need to review
protocols with you.

16:37.067 --> 16:40.369
Let's not waste any time.

16:43.771 --> 16:45.970
Did you live here long?

16:46.038 --> 16:48.003
No. Just during my recovery.

16:50.104 --> 16:53.305
You know, I still think
I got some coffee around here.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.320
What's her name,
your granddaughter?

17:15.388 --> 17:17.490
Teri.

17:18.558 --> 17:20.559
Kim named her after her mom.

17:27.733 --> 17:30.299
Jack, listen,

17:30.366 --> 17:33.835
I know that we've said a lot
of things to each other,

17:33.903 --> 17:36.404
and you've made promises
to me about...

17:39.041 --> 17:41.008
I just

17:41.076 --> 17:43.577
want you to know that I'm not
gonna hold you to them.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.980
It's been

17:46.047 --> 17:47.281
a terrible day, and I know

17:47.348 --> 17:48.815
that we-we say things
in the moment, and I just...

17:48.883 --> 17:50.050
I don't want you to...

18:21.873 --> 18:23.139
Hello?

18:23.207 --> 18:25.275
Somebody there?

19:28.229 --> 19:30.163
Take my briefcase
to Marine One,

19:30.231 --> 19:33.031
and tell the Secret Service
I'll be ready to leave shortly.

19:33.099 --> 19:34.966
And send Mr. Novakovich in.

19:35.034 --> 19:36.468
Yes, ma'am.

19:44.944 --> 19:46.512
Mr. Novakovich.

19:46.579 --> 19:48.347
Thank you for seeing
me, Madam President.

19:48.415 --> 19:49.615
Not at all.

19:49.683 --> 19:52.251
What can I do for you?

19:52.319 --> 19:54.152
I just had a curious phone call

19:54.220 --> 19:56.154
from Tim Woods

19:56.221 --> 19:58.723
indicating that you are
intending to move forward

19:58.791 --> 20:01.160
with the peace initiative
with the IRK.

20:01.227 --> 20:03.227
That's correct.
May I ask

20:03.295 --> 20:04.796
how you propose to do this,

20:04.863 --> 20:06.631
considering
their leader is dead?

20:06.698 --> 20:08.733
Well, I intended
to answer that question

20:08.800 --> 20:10.735
during my address
to the Assembly,

20:10.803 --> 20:12.537
but since you're asking...

20:12.604 --> 20:15.373
Dalia Hassan will be signing
the agreement

20:15.441 --> 20:17.142
in her husband's stead.

20:17.210 --> 20:20.078
That's... an interesting idea,
Madam President,

20:20.146 --> 20:22.681
but I don't see
how she would have the authority

20:22.748 --> 20:24.015
to sign such a document.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.917
She's getting it
from her government now.

20:25.984 --> 20:28.085
Their parliament called
an emergency session

20:28.153 --> 20:31.022
to ratify her
as provisional president.

20:31.090 --> 20:33.892
The letter confirming that
is forthcoming.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.494
Madam President,
I appreciate your optimism,

20:36.562 --> 20:38.596
but I don't understand
how you can believe

20:38.664 --> 20:40.565
that installing Hassan's widow

20:40.633 --> 20:43.569
as some kind of figurehead
will alleviate our concerns

20:43.636 --> 20:46.005
about the instability
of the IRK government.

20:46.073 --> 20:48.474
With President Hassan dead,

20:48.542 --> 20:50.943
the opposition
will only get stronger.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.611
Hassan's death will galvanize
his supporters

20:53.679 --> 20:55.746
and every advocate
of this peace process

20:55.814 --> 20:58.082
to endorse her
as his successor.

20:58.150 --> 20:59.984
You can't be certain of that.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.822
Once again, Mr. Novakovich,

21:03.889 --> 21:05.357
you're giving every indication

21:05.425 --> 21:08.560
that Russia has no interest
in this peace accord.

21:08.628 --> 21:11.496
I'm sorry that you feel
that way, Madam President,

21:11.564 --> 21:14.835
but the fact remains
that we are no longer confident

21:14.902 --> 21:17.577
that any meaningful progress
can be made.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.228
Respectfully,
my country will be declining

21:20.296 --> 21:22.237
to sign your peace document.

21:22.305 --> 21:23.642
Excuse me.

21:23.713 --> 21:27.581
Do I need to take this up
with President Suvarov myself?

21:27.649 --> 21:30.213
If you like,
but I can assure you,

21:30.281 --> 21:32.115
I have full authority
on this matter.

21:32.183 --> 21:35.586
Any decision that I make
represents the formal position

21:35.653 --> 21:37.187
of the Russian government.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.256
Good day.

21:55.195 --> 21:57.863
Agent Peters, I need
to see Secretary Kanin now.

21:57.930 --> 21:59.030
Yes, Madam President.

21:59.098 --> 22:00.698
Liberty's on the move.

22:00.766 --> 22:03.971
We managed to clear a blockage in
one of your coronary arteries,

22:04.039 --> 22:05.908
and the X-rays show
the heart muscle damage

22:05.975 --> 22:07.342
to be less than we expected.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.745
In other words,
I'm a tough son of a bitch.

22:09.813 --> 22:12.415
You're a lucky man, I'll say
that for you, Mr. Secretary.

22:12.482 --> 22:14.584
I guess that means
I can resume my duties.

22:14.652 --> 22:16.286
Although the procedure
was noninvasive,

22:16.354 --> 22:18.322
I'd prefer it if you
took it easy for a little while.

22:18.389 --> 22:20.391
That isn't a no.

22:21.693 --> 22:23.829
Hello, Ethan.
How are you feeling?

22:23.896 --> 22:27.299
Well, uh, I've
seen better days.

22:27.367 --> 22:29.735
Would you give us
a few moments, please?

22:29.803 --> 22:31.470
Thank you.

22:35.305 --> 22:37.236
You heard about Hassan?

22:37.304 --> 22:39.036
Tim Woods told me.

22:39.104 --> 22:41.471
He also filled me in
on the IRK plan

22:41.539 --> 22:43.774
to install Dalia Hassan.

22:43.842 --> 22:45.810
What do you think?

22:45.877 --> 22:48.813
Her family's well
connected and powerful.

22:48.881 --> 22:50.682
I think it's an inspired idea.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.118
Well, the Russians don't.

22:53.186 --> 22:56.521
Novakovich told me in no uncertain
terms they won't accept her.

22:56.589 --> 22:59.390
They're using it as an excuse
to pull out of the signing.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.692
Even if the IRK

23:00.760 --> 23:03.461
has a new leader,
the peace agreement won't stand

23:03.529 --> 23:05.397
without Moscow's endorsement.

23:05.464 --> 23:07.266
I need your help, Ethan.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.168
You got the Russians
to the table.

23:09.236 --> 23:11.270
What can I do
to keep them there?

23:11.338 --> 23:14.507
There may be someone
who can help us here.

23:14.575 --> 23:17.009
But you're not gonna like it.

23:17.077 --> 23:18.277
Who?

23:18.345 --> 23:19.944
Charles Logan.

23:20.012 --> 23:21.078
Logan?

23:21.146 --> 23:23.345
Ethan, you can't be serious.

23:23.412 --> 23:24.678
The man's a criminal.

23:24.744 --> 23:26.878
<i>I don't care if he was pardoned.</i>

23:26.946 --> 23:29.281
I didn't agree with President
Daniels' decision, either,

23:29.348 --> 23:32.318
but the fact is he's left
several messages at my office

23:32.386 --> 23:34.019
over the past hour.

23:34.087 --> 23:36.588
Apparently, he's aware
of the Russians' reticence

23:36.656 --> 23:39.691
in signing the agreement;
he's offered his assistance.

23:39.758 --> 23:42.593
How could he possibly know about this?
Well, despite

23:42.661 --> 23:44.961
his political downfall,
he's managed to maintain

23:45.029 --> 23:47.729
a uniquely close relationship
with Moscow.

23:47.797 --> 23:50.098
His messages indicated
he has information

23:50.166 --> 23:51.399
which might prove useful

23:51.467 --> 23:54.102
in keeping the
Russians at the table.

23:54.170 --> 23:55.737
What information?

23:55.805 --> 23:58.106
He didn't say.

23:58.174 --> 24:00.876
Allison...

24:00.943 --> 24:03.712
I don't trust this man
any more than you do,

24:03.779 --> 24:05.981
but I'd be remiss
if I didn't urge you

24:06.048 --> 24:09.183
to at least... hear him out.

24:16.724 --> 24:19.193
Okay, listen up,
everyone, please.

24:22.797 --> 24:25.099
I've never been very good
at good-byes.

24:25.167 --> 24:27.969
But I want to tell you
what an honor it's been

24:28.037 --> 24:30.939
for me to have served

24:31.006 --> 24:34.009
with each and every one of you.

24:35.378 --> 24:37.513
Division is now vetting names

24:37.581 --> 24:39.281
to replace me.

24:39.349 --> 24:41.616
In the meantime, Chloe O'Brian

24:41.684 --> 24:43.351
will be in charge, and I'm sure

24:43.419 --> 24:46.989
you will show her the same level
of loyalty and commitment

24:47.056 --> 24:49.358
that you've all shown me.

24:51.294 --> 24:52.695
Thank you.

25:04.071 --> 25:05.304
Sir...

25:05.372 --> 25:07.540
Aw, don't worry, Chloe,
you can do this.

25:07.608 --> 25:08.708
I hope so.

25:08.776 --> 25:11.744
I just want to say,
we had a rough start,

25:11.812 --> 25:14.280
but I eventually
really enjoyed working for you.

25:14.348 --> 25:17.015
Well, I'm happy to say
that I was wrong about you.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.149
If I had listened to
you in the beginning,

25:19.217 --> 25:20.950
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

25:21.018 --> 25:22.218
I doubt it.

25:22.286 --> 25:23.986
I'll be at Division debriefing.

25:24.054 --> 25:26.893
But I'm available to you
if you have any questions.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.897
Thank you, sir.

25:28.965 --> 25:30.398
Good luck.

25:30.466 --> 25:31.966
Mr. Hastings.

25:32.034 --> 25:33.501
I have Agent Ortiz on the line.

25:33.569 --> 25:34.903
They have a situation
in Medical.

25:34.971 --> 25:37.272
This one's all yours, Chloe.

25:38.709 --> 25:40.711
Ms. O'Brian.

25:40.779 --> 25:42.011
Cole, it's Chloe.

25:42.079 --> 25:42.878
Where's Hastings?

25:42.945 --> 25:44.479
He's not here.

25:44.547 --> 25:45.884
What happened?

25:45.952 --> 25:46.887
Samir's just gone
into cardiac arrest.

25:46.954 --> 25:48.188
What?

25:48.256 --> 25:49.690
I need four
milligrams epinephrine

25:49.757 --> 25:50.924
and 275 Lidocaine.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.227
I'll be right there.

25:56.864 --> 25:58.130
Clear!

26:04.801 --> 26:06.868
Going again at 360.

26:08.404 --> 26:09.571
Clear!

26:20.115 --> 26:21.881
What happened?

26:21.949 --> 26:23.449
I thought his injuries
were not life-threatening.

26:23.517 --> 26:24.747
So did I.

26:24.815 --> 26:26.282
Where the hell is Hastings?

26:26.350 --> 26:27.449
He's been removed by Division.

26:27.517 --> 26:29.050
Who's in command?

26:29.118 --> 26:32.521
I am... until they find
a replacement.

26:32.588 --> 26:34.192
You were with Samir
the whole time?

26:34.259 --> 26:35.594
All the way
from the scene, yeah.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.066
What about at the scene?

26:37.134 --> 26:39.869
He may have been out of
my sight for a few minutes.

26:39.937 --> 26:42.972
Emergency personnel
were with him.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.241
Look, we got to move his body
to the morgue for an autopsy.

26:45.308 --> 26:48.043
Not yet... order
a preliminary toxicology panel.

26:48.111 --> 26:49.311
But they'll run a full
panel during the autopsy.

26:49.379 --> 26:50.545
I want it done now!

26:50.613 --> 26:52.013
Chloe, he was barely conscious.

26:52.081 --> 26:54.082
He couldn't have taken
something to off himself.

26:54.150 --> 26:57.018
No, but somebody
could have given it to him.

27:01.390 --> 27:03.124
Do what she says.

27:03.192 --> 27:05.726
I'll be in Hastings' office...
my office.

27:05.794 --> 27:08.228
Let me know when
you find something.

27:27.269 --> 27:30.171
A few of the more conservative
members of our delegation

27:30.239 --> 27:32.606
may continue to resist you,

27:32.674 --> 27:34.607
but... we can...

27:34.675 --> 27:36.542
we can persuade them.

27:36.610 --> 27:38.944
Perhaps if I spoke
to them personally.

27:39.012 --> 27:40.211
A very good idea.

27:47.884 --> 27:49.385
Miss Kayla,

27:49.452 --> 27:52.654
I didn't get a chance to tell
you how deeply sorry I am.

27:52.722 --> 27:55.156
Thank you.

27:55.224 --> 27:56.891
Well...

27:56.958 --> 27:58.392
I will see you both

27:58.460 --> 28:00.461
back at the U.N.

28:02.131 --> 28:03.232
The U.N.?

28:03.299 --> 28:05.235
I thought you were going home.

28:05.302 --> 28:07.169
No, not yet.
There are new developments.

28:07.237 --> 28:09.271
I'll explain them to you
on the way.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.672
What is going on, Mother?

28:10.740 --> 28:12.741
Why did President
Taylor and Jamot

28:12.809 --> 28:14.843
want to speak with you alo

28:14.911 --> 28:17.479
They have asked me
to consider staying on...

28:17.547 --> 28:20.649
to complete your father's work.

28:20.716 --> 28:23.318
I don't understand...
what does that mean?

28:23.385 --> 28:28.188
Our party wishes to appoint me
as the new president.

28:30.392 --> 28:32.793
What was your answer?

28:32.861 --> 28:35.029
You told them

28:35.097 --> 28:37.265
you couldn't possibly accept,
not after what's happened.

28:37.332 --> 28:38.466
Kayla!

28:38.534 --> 28:40.836
Our country is
on the verge of a coup

28:40.903 --> 28:44.172
by the people responsible
for the murder of your father.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.874
Someone must lead.

28:45.942 --> 28:48.544
You can't beat them,
don't you realize that by now?

28:48.612 --> 28:50.045
I don't believe that; I won't.

28:50.113 --> 28:52.280
And the greatest blow
I can strike against them

28:52.348 --> 28:53.848
is to sign the peace agreement.

28:53.916 --> 28:55.483
This will be
your father's legacy.

28:55.550 --> 28:57.517
It will be
a death sentence for you!

28:57.585 --> 28:58.785
You want peace to live,

28:58.853 --> 29:00.554
but all these people want
is anarchy.

29:00.622 --> 29:01.722
Oh, Mother, they'll kill you!

29:01.789 --> 29:03.256
Enough!

29:07.928 --> 29:11.796
You are not the only one
who has suffered today.

29:11.864 --> 29:14.032
This was not

29:14.100 --> 29:17.935
an easy decision for me,
but it was mine to make.

29:18.003 --> 29:21.705
I do not need you
to remind me of the danger.

29:21.773 --> 29:24.607
I need you to help me be strong.

29:26.443 --> 29:30.512
Now, pull yourself together...
there is a car waiting for us.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.315
Well, I'm sure the media does
want a response, but I'm not

29:45.382 --> 29:47.082
ready to give them one
just yet.

29:47.150 --> 29:48.584
They'll have to wait.

29:48.652 --> 29:49.718
All right.

29:49.786 --> 29:51.586
Thank you.

29:51.654 --> 29:54.154
The press secretary says
the Russians are already

29:54.222 --> 29:56.556
leaking to the news channels
their intention

29:56.624 --> 29:58.591
to "reluctantly"
pull out of the talks.

29:58.659 --> 30:00.660
They don't like wasting time.

30:00.728 --> 30:02.862
Has my guest arrived?

30:02.929 --> 30:04.263
Yes, ma'am.
I had Secret Service

30:04.331 --> 30:05.931
bring him in
through the frght entrance

30:05.999 --> 30:08.500
and then deliver him discreetly
to conference room number three,

30:08.568 --> 30:09.734
as you asked.

30:09.802 --> 30:11.235
Thank you, Tim.

30:11.303 --> 30:12.703
Yes, ma'am.

30:36.590 --> 30:39.358
Madame President,
let me convey my condolences

30:39.426 --> 30:41.426
on the loss of President Hassan.

30:41.494 --> 30:43.895
I know you worked
closely with him.

30:43.963 --> 30:46.464
This must be very hard for you.

30:46.532 --> 30:50.133
Thank you... for your
sympathy, Mr. President.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.768
If you don't mind, I'd
like to talk to you alone.

30:53.836 --> 30:57.103
This is my executive assistant,
Jason Pillar.

30:57.171 --> 30:59.039
I assure you he can be trusted.

30:59.106 --> 31:00.407
Well, forgive me

31:00.475 --> 31:02.375
if I don't give much weight
to your endorsement.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.443
He needs to leave.

31:05.579 --> 31:07.582
Will you excuse us, Jason?

31:13.421 --> 31:15.788
Let's get something straight.

31:15.856 --> 31:19.091
I agreed to this meeting
only at the behest

31:19.158 --> 31:21.125
of Secretary Kanin.

31:21.193 --> 31:24.461
Now, I'm not sure you're
entirely aware of the situation.

31:24.529 --> 31:26.162
My understanding is,
the Russians are

31:26.230 --> 31:28.664
rejecting Dalia Hassan
as a legitimate successor,

31:28.732 --> 31:32.134
and as a result, won't sign off
on the peace agreement.

31:32.202 --> 31:33.769
You're well informed.

31:33.837 --> 31:36.772
I have close friends in Moscow.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.274
In some ways, people there

31:39.342 --> 31:42.110
appreciate me more than
people in my own country.

31:42.177 --> 31:45.914
It wasn't their constitution
you trampled.

31:45.982 --> 31:47.982
The Russians

31:48.050 --> 31:51.551
have been trying to back out
of this agreement from day one.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.986
Do you honestly think
your relationships

31:54.054 --> 31:55.688
can change their minds?

31:55.756 --> 31:57.423
I'm certain I can.

31:57.491 --> 31:59.459
How?
Let's just say

31:59.526 --> 32:03.495
I'm going to be able
to exercise some leverage.

32:03.563 --> 32:05.664
What kind of leverage?

32:05.732 --> 32:08.466
If it gets the job done,
does it really matter?

32:08.534 --> 32:10.001
It does to me.

32:10.069 --> 32:11.269
I can promise you

32:11.337 --> 32:12.470
no laws'll be broken,

32:12.538 --> 32:14.806
nothing will tarnish you
or your presidency,

32:14.874 --> 32:19.512
but the details really must stay
between me and the Russians.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.918
You and President Hassan
created the framework

32:25.985 --> 32:29.488
for the most significant peace
in a generation, and you got

32:29.555 --> 32:32.523
the entire world behind it.

32:32.591 --> 32:35.993
To let the Russians tear down
what should be the crown jewel

32:36.061 --> 32:37.127
in your administration...

32:37.195 --> 32:39.028
Don't play me.

32:39.096 --> 32:40.696
This is about you

32:40.764 --> 32:44.199
trying to repair
your reputation.

32:44.267 --> 32:46.468
Is that so hard to understand?

32:46.535 --> 32:47.903
You participated

32:47.971 --> 32:52.209
in a conspiracy to cover up the
assassination of David Palmer.

32:52.276 --> 32:53.878
I was trying
to protect the country

32:53.946 --> 32:55.847
from an unnecessary trauma...
Don't! You were

32:55.915 --> 32:59.250
doing what was best
for yourself.

33:00.285 --> 33:03.554
Yes.

33:03.622 --> 33:07.393
You're right, Madam President.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.495
You're right.

33:09.563 --> 33:10.995
I suppose I've spent
so many years

33:11.063 --> 33:13.262
trying to justify my actions

33:13.330 --> 33:15.931
that it's become difficult
for me...

33:18.201 --> 33:20.769
to own up to the truth.

33:22.472 --> 33:25.941
I made mistakes,

33:26.009 --> 33:28.478
terrible mistakes, that stained

33:28.545 --> 33:31.877
the office of the presidency...

33:31.945 --> 33:35.817
and for which I will be paying
the rest of my life.

33:37.421 --> 33:41.626
But I still can be
of value to my country.

33:44.695 --> 33:47.130
I can still do some good.

33:47.198 --> 33:49.966
Look, we both know you wouldn't

33:50.034 --> 33:53.402
have called me unless
you were out of options,

33:53.470 --> 33:55.769
so we can continue
to dwell on the past,

33:55.836 --> 33:58.871
or you can let me pursue
the only chance you have

33:58.939 --> 34:01.340
of resurrecting
the peace process.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.942
Please.

34:07.778 --> 34:09.779
Let me help you.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.485
All right.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.154
Thank you.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.391
What do you intend to do first?

34:21.458 --> 34:24.960
Arrange a meeting with
the Russian delegate Novakovich.

34:25.029 --> 34:27.597
Uh, get a message
to him at his hotel.

34:27.665 --> 34:30.266
Tell him that you are sending
over your official emissary

34:30.333 --> 34:33.235
to have a talk with him.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.605
What if he doesn't agree
to this meeting?

34:35.672 --> 34:37.172
Make sure he knows it's me.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.975
He'll agree to it.

34:39.043 --> 34:43.947
God help you
if you make me regret this.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.446
O'Brian.

35:11.514 --> 35:14.415
You okay?

35:14.483 --> 35:16.751
Perfect.

35:16.819 --> 35:19.120
Promise?
Hmm.

35:21.690 --> 35:23.358
I am so thirsty.

35:23.426 --> 35:24.726
Me, too.

35:24.794 --> 35:28.063
Do you want me to get you
something to drink?

35:28.130 --> 35:30.132
Okay.

35:33.069 --> 35:35.403
I'll be right back.

35:51.251 --> 35:53.619
Don't move.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.769
Jack, your cell's ringing.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.270
Don't worry about it, let it go.

36:22.679 --> 36:24.013
Hello.
Jack's phone.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.480
Renee, it's Chloe.
I need to talk to Jack.

36:25.548 --> 36:26.481
What's wrong?

36:26.549 --> 36:27.715
Samir Mehran is dead.

36:27.783 --> 36:29.149
I think he was assassinated.

36:29.217 --> 36:31.652
What do you mean, assassinated?

36:31.720 --> 36:33.054
I ran a preliminary
toxicology report.

36:33.121 --> 36:35.856
It showed traces
of an unidentified toxin

36:35.924 --> 36:36.958
in his bloodstream.

36:37.025 --> 36:37.994
Someone must have injected him

36:38.061 --> 36:40.665
with it, probably at the scene.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.801
There was,
there was an EMT there.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.169
He looked familiar.

36:45.237 --> 36:48.242
There was so much going on,
I-I didn't take much notice.

36:48.310 --> 36:49.978
Familiar? From where?

36:50.046 --> 36:52.485
I need you to get
my FBI case files.

36:52.553 --> 36:54.154
Get me everything you have
on Red Square.

36:54.221 --> 36:55.855
You think he was
from the Russian Mob?

36:55.923 --> 36:57.990
He looked like somebody who
was with Vladimir Laitanan

36:58.058 --> 36:59.792
during the time I was under.

36:59.859 --> 37:00.826
That was six years ago.

37:00.893 --> 37:01.826
Are you sure?

37:01.894 --> 37:03.693
Honestly, no.

37:03.761 --> 37:05.325
Just send me the case files,

37:05.393 --> 37:07.524
all the surveillance photos
that were taken,

37:07.592 --> 37:09.189
and I'll see if he's in there.

37:09.257 --> 37:10.422
Okay.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.156
Jack...

37:12.223 --> 37:13.156
you need to hear this.

37:13.224 --> 37:14.523
Samir...

37:18.760 --> 37:19.860
Renee...

37:19.927 --> 37:21.295
Renee!

37:27.467 --> 37:29.101
Renee?
Come on. Come on.

37:31.405 --> 37:32.339
Jack.

37:32.407 --> 37:33.574
Renee, are you there?
Jack.

37:33.642 --> 37:36.544
Don't talk, I'm gonna
get you to a hospital.

37:36.612 --> 37:37.779
Did something happen?

37:37.846 --> 37:39.580
Who is this?
It's Chloe.

37:39.648 --> 37:40.581
Chloe, it's Jack.

37:40.649 --> 37:41.749
Renee's been hit by a sniper

37:41.816 --> 37:42.749
through the window
of my apartment.

37:42.817 --> 37:43.950
We're still taking fire.

37:44.018 --> 37:45.518
I need a trauma team
at St. Andrew's now.

37:45.586 --> 37:47.086
Hold on, stay with me.

37:47.154 --> 37:48.154
Come on.

37:48.989 --> 37:50.289
Let's go.

38:26.793 --> 38:27.795
Keep everybody in the lobby.

38:27.863 --> 38:28.797
There's a sniper outside.

38:28.865 --> 38:29.998
Call 911.

38:30.066 --> 38:31.466
Now!

38:37.406 --> 38:38.706
Move!

38:44.511 --> 38:46.144
She's been shot;
We need to get to the hospital...

38:46.212 --> 38:47.714
St. Andrew's Hospital,
22nd and Ninth.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.304
Come on, you can make it.

38:58.372 --> 39:01.341
Wait... just wait...

39:06.747 --> 39:07.881
We're gonna make it.

39:07.949 --> 39:09.449
We're gonna make it, I promise.

39:09.517 --> 39:10.984
Do whatever you have to!

39:11.052 --> 39:13.286
We've got to get
to the hospital now!

39:18.225 --> 39:20.225
Come on, come on.

39:20.293 --> 39:22.727
I got you, I got you.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.228
I got you.

39:24.296 --> 39:25.229
You'll be all right.

39:25.297 --> 39:26.864
We're almost there.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.232
They're a few blocks
from your hospital

39:28.299 --> 39:29.399
and should be there any minute.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.467
Please make sure
she's given priority care.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.501
Thank you.

39:32.569 --> 39:33.502
Arlo,

39:33.569 --> 39:34.503
pull up satellite.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.704
Isolate the areas

39:35.771 --> 39:37.638
between Eighth Avenue
and West 18th Street.

39:37.706 --> 39:39.506
What's going on?
Renee Walker was just shot.

39:39.574 --> 39:41.875
What?!
Just do what I asked.

39:41.943 --> 39:43.109
Jack said the sniper
was positioned

39:43.177 --> 39:44.344
at his apartment at 1145

39:44.412 --> 39:45.912
West 18th Street.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.380
Roll back the feed
three minutes.

39:47.448 --> 39:48.515
Is she gonna be okay?

39:48.583 --> 39:50.317
He's rushing her
to the hospital now.

39:50.384 --> 39:51.384
I don't get it.

39:51.452 --> 39:53.052
Why would anyone want
to kill Renee?

39:56.324 --> 39:59.159
Help! She's been shot!
There's no exit wound!

39:59.227 --> 40:01.528
We got a gunshot wound to
the chest... let's move.

40:01.596 --> 40:02.996
What's her pulse?

40:03.064 --> 40:05.532
110, respiratory
is still ragged.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.800
Check her carotid.

40:06.868 --> 40:08.434
BP is 80 over 50.

40:08.502 --> 40:09.434
Right here.

40:09.502 --> 40:10.635
What do we have?
Five is prepped.

40:10.703 --> 40:11.803
We're gonna take care of you.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.273
O.R. five, let's go.
How many gunshot wounds?

40:13.340 --> 40:14.941
One in the chest.
Sir, you need to stay right here.

40:15.008 --> 40:17.042
Is patient typing crossed?
No.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.011
Call the blood bank, send up
four units of O-negative.

40:19.078 --> 40:20.779
Right away. TEAM LEADER:
Come on, come on, come on.

40:51.942 --> 40:53.243
Yeah.

40:53.311 --> 40:54.645
Jack, it's Chloe.
How is she?

40:54.713 --> 40:56.480
Not good.

40:56.547 --> 40:59.549
We rolled back satellite to
the area around your building.

40:59.617 --> 41:01.285
The shots were fired

41:01.352 --> 41:03.790
from an office
across the street.

41:03.858 --> 41:06.296
PD reported finding a body
at the scene.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.733
What about the shooter?

41:07.801 --> 41:09.838
We don't have anything.

41:09.906 --> 41:11.241
We lost him.

41:11.308 --> 41:13.610
You were on the phone with her
right before she got shot.

41:13.677 --> 41:14.978
What were you talking about?

41:15.046 --> 41:17.180
It's not important right now.

41:17.248 --> 41:18.181
Just...

41:18.249 --> 41:19.282
be with her.

41:19.349 --> 41:21.551
She's in surgery,
Chloe, I can't.

41:21.618 --> 41:22.952
What were you talking about?

41:23.020 --> 41:24.621
I told her what I'm
calling to tell you.

41:24.689 --> 41:27.424
Samir Mehran was given a
lethal injection at the scene

41:27.492 --> 41:30.093
of his capture, probably
to keep him from talking.

41:30.161 --> 41:32.963
Renee thought she may have
recognized one of the EMTs.

41:33.030 --> 41:34.964
She didn't say anything to me.

41:35.032 --> 41:36.165
She wasn't sure.

41:36.233 --> 41:38.801
She didn't think it meant
anything at the time.

41:38.869 --> 41:41.304
Where did she say she
remembered him from?

41:41.372 --> 41:43.573
From her days undercover
with the Russian Mob.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.275
She asked me to get her
the Red Square file.

41:46.343 --> 41:47.610
Did you pull up the file?

41:47.677 --> 41:49.745
Yes.

41:52.582 --> 41:54.616
Jack?

41:54.684 --> 41:56.417
I gotta get back to you.

41:59.422 --> 42:01.756
I'm sorry, she didn't make it.

42:01.824 --> 42:03.559
There was just
too much arterial damage

42:03.626 --> 42:05.328
and blood loss.

42:05.396 --> 42:07.397
I'm very sorry.
