WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:04.569
DEAR KATE,
TODAY'S THE DAY

00:04.613 --> 00:06.223
I'M SUPPOSED TO DIE.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.704
TRUTH IS I'M NOT SCARED
OF DYING.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.880
I'M SCARED I DIDN'T LIVE.

00:10.923 --> 00:13.361
MY MAMA ALWAYS TOLD ME I WAS
PUT ON THIS EARTH FOR A REASON,

00:13.404 --> 00:15.972
AND NOW I FINALLY KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

00:18.757 --> 00:21.412
TODAY IS THE DAY
I KILL YOU, KATE.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.067
I SPENT 11 YEARS WAITING
FOR YOU TO FIND ME,

00:24.111 --> 00:27.288
BUT INSTEAD, I FOUND YOU.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.377
THEN, I WAITED FOR YOU
TO SAVE ME,

00:29.420 --> 00:32.249
BUT INSTEAD,
I SAVED YOU,

00:32.293 --> 00:34.686
I TURNED YOU INTO A HERO.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.211
YOU HELPED ME FIND
MY INNER WARRIOR,

00:37.254 --> 00:39.778
MY VOICE, MY POWER.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.954
WHILE I PLAYED
THE PART OF YOUR VILLAIN,

00:41.998 --> 00:45.175
THE GIRL WHO REMINDED YOU
HOW RIGHT AND NOBLE

00:45.219 --> 00:47.003
AND COURAGEOUS YOU WERE.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.744
YOU MADE ME FEEL BRAVE.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.398
SO I TOLD YOU
MY GREATEST FEAR

00:50.441 --> 00:52.008
WAS BEING LOCKED AWAY AGAIN,

00:52.052 --> 00:55.403
AND ON THAT VERY DAY,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:55.446 --> 00:57.144
YOU HELPED ME BREAK
OUT OF THE SYSTEM

00:57.187 --> 00:58.928
THAT WAS TRAPPING ME.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.582
YOU LURED ME INTO A BOX,

01:00.625 --> 01:02.758
AND YOU LOCKED THE DOOR.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.760
I'VE COME SO FAR...

01:04.803 --> 01:06.414
TO GET MY REVENGE.

01:06.457 --> 01:08.155
TO INSPIRE OTHERS,

01:08.198 --> 01:11.114
AND I'VE SURVIVED MUCH WORSE.

01:11.158 --> 01:14.074
CARTWRIGHT,
THE QUEEN OF HEARTS...

01:14.117 --> 01:16.554
FOSTER CARE,
THE CANDY LADY.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.208
IF I COULD DO THAT...

01:18.252 --> 01:20.167
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.603
I CAN PUSH OFF DEATH
ANOTHER DAY

01:21.646 --> 01:24.301
IF IT MEANS SAVING YOU.

01:24.345 --> 01:27.130
I CAN EVEN KILL
MY SISTER.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.479
♪ HIDE IT

01:28.523 --> 01:32.048
♪ WHEN YOU'RE ULTRAVIOLET

01:42.711 --> 01:45.148
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
I'M THE ONE WHO PRACTICES

01:45.192 --> 01:47.019
WITHOUT A MEDICAL LICENSE
AROUND HERE.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.369
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:48.412 --> 01:50.936
IT IS...
A COMBINATION

01:50.980 --> 01:52.895
OF ADRENALINE
AND CORTISONE.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.854
IT WILL GIVE ME
A JOLT OF ENERGY,

01:55.898 --> 01:57.900
AND IT WILL KILL
SOME OF THIS PAIN.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.249
-YEAH.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:59.293 --> 02:00.816
HOW DID YOU EVEN LEARN
HOW TO DO THIS?

02:00.859 --> 02:03.601
YOUTUBE. WHAT?!

02:03.645 --> 02:05.734
OH! DID THE YOUTUBE
MEDICAL EXPERT

02:05.777 --> 02:07.562
ALSO EXPLAIN TO YOU
THAT THIS COMBINATION

02:07.605 --> 02:11.131
WILL ACCELERATE THE SPEED
OF CELL DECAY BY 300%?

02:11.174 --> 02:13.220
WITHOUT THE SHOT,
YOU HAVE DAYS,

02:13.263 --> 02:17.049
AND WITH IT, YOU'RE
LUCKY TO HAVE 24 HOURS.

02:18.921 --> 02:22.011
24 HOURS IS
ALL I NEED.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.578
I PUT THE TRACKER
ON ALICE,

02:23.621 --> 02:25.406
SHE PROBABLY MADE IT
TO CORYANA BY NOW.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.582
I WILL FOLLOW
HER ROUTE.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.453
I WILL FIND KATE,

02:29.497 --> 02:31.629
AND I WILL GET
THE DESERT ROSE
TO HEAL MYSELF.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.284
AND IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG, YOU DIE.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.765
MARY, LOOK AT ME.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.984
I'M DEAD ALREADY.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.814
-OH, MY GOD.
-OH, GOD.

02:42.858 --> 02:46.296
FINE. TEAM VOTE.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.603
WHERE'S LUKE?

02:48.646 --> 02:50.692
ACTUALLY...

02:50.735 --> 02:52.607
MARY, WHERE'S LUKE?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.438
I HAVE AN ACTIVE APB

02:57.481 --> 02:59.353
AND 3 FIELD TEAMS LOOKING
FOR ALICE,

02:59.396 --> 03:01.529
YET YOU NOT ONLY MANAGED
TO LOCATE HER

03:01.572 --> 03:05.228
BUT TAGGED HER
WITH A HIGH-POWERED
TRACKING DEVICE?

03:05.272 --> 03:06.838
HOW?

03:06.882 --> 03:08.405
I'M SURE YOU'RE
FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT

03:08.449 --> 03:11.016
DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.758
THEN I WON'T ASK.
I WILL STATE.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.544
YOU'RE WORKING
WITH BATWOMAN.

03:16.587 --> 03:20.722
MM-HMM. SO WHY
DOESN'T SHE TRACK ALICE?

03:22.158 --> 03:24.726
-BECAUSE SHE'S SICK.
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN SICK?

03:24.769 --> 03:26.989
SHE'S DYING.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.644
LONG STORY SHORT,
TOMMY ELLIOT SHOT HER
WITH A POISON BULLET,

03:29.687 --> 03:31.254
AND THERE'S NO ANTIDOTE,

03:31.298 --> 03:32.951
SO WE NEED YOU TO
BRING BACK A STEM

03:32.995 --> 03:34.866
OF THE DESERT ROSE
TO HEAL HER.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.738
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

03:36.781 --> 03:40.959
OUR APB FOR ALICE
AND ALL KNOWN ASSOCIATES
TURNED UP THIS.

03:41.003 --> 03:45.181
HER FRIEND OCEAN BOARDED
A FLIGHT TO ROME LAST NIGHT.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.576
THANKS.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.621
THE DEAL ALICE MADE
WITH SAFIYAH

03:50.665 --> 03:53.189
WAS THAT SHE HAD TO
KILL OCEAN TO GET
KATE BACK.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.844
I DOUBT SHE SHOWED UP
TO CORYANA WITHOUT HIM.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.455
BUT SHE IS CRAZY
ENOUGH TO SHOW UP
WITH A FAKE HIM.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.109
IT WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME
SHE SLAPPED A FACE

04:00.152 --> 04:01.415
ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S
BODY.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.894
GOD KNOWS
SHE FOOLED ME

04:02.938 --> 04:04.809
WITH THE BRUCE WAYNE
WANNABE.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.421
IF THAT'S TRUE
AND SAFIYAH BELIEVES
THE IMPOSTER,

04:07.464 --> 04:09.292
THEN SHE HANDS KATE
OVER TO ALICE,

04:09.336 --> 04:10.815
AND ALICE KILLS HER.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.601
WHICH MEANS YOU NEED
TO GET GOING NOW.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.779
THE TRACKER SHOWS
THAT ALICE LEFT

04:17.822 --> 04:19.259
THE OLSSON AIRSTRIP
AND FLEW EAST.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.912
SOPHIE LOW-KEY SLIPPED
ME THE FEED.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.088
SO WE'RE GONNA
GLOSS OVER YOU TELLING

04:23.132 --> 04:24.568
A CROW YOU'RE WORKING
WITH BATWOMAN?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.309
IT WAS PREFERABLE
TO LOSING BOTH BATWOMEN

04:26.353 --> 04:27.789
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.314
SOPHIE SAID SHE WOULD
GET A FLOWER.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.968
AND YOU BELIEVE HER?

04:33.011 --> 04:35.318
CAN WE STAY
POSITIVE, PLEASE?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.972
WE LAND,
FIND MY DAUGHTER,

04:37.015 --> 04:38.190
GET OUT.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.018
AND I AM SCREWED.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.933
ONE MORE THING.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.413
WE NEED TO GRAB
A DESERT ROSE
WHILE WE'RE THERE.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.632
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.111
AND I REST MY CASE.

04:46.155 --> 04:47.809
I'LL EXPLAIN
EN ROUTE,

04:47.852 --> 04:49.289
BUT WE'RE NOT LEAVING
THAT ISLAND WITHOUT IT.

04:51.682 --> 04:52.901
RAH!

04:52.944 --> 04:54.816
NO!
COMMANDER!

04:54.859 --> 04:56.818
-WAIT. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
-THEY'RE SAFIYAH'S MEN.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.821
THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT SAFIYAH KNEW
THEY WERE COMING.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.527
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

05:10.571 --> 05:12.355
THEY'RE TAKING THEM
SOMEWHERE.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.314
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HEADING
TOWARD OLSSON AIRSTRIP.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.750
IT'S THE SAME AIRFIELD
THAT ALICE LEFT FROM.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.621
SO THEY'RE GOING
TO CORYANA?

05:17.665 --> 05:20.494
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.365
RYAN, NO!

05:22.409 --> 05:24.367
YOU INJECT THAT,
YOU DIE TODAY!

05:24.411 --> 05:26.151
WE LITERALLY JUST
WATCHED

05:26.195 --> 05:28.502
OUR LAST HOPE FIZZLE
BEFORE OUR EYES.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.895
UNLESS ANYONE ELSE
HAS ANY MORE
BRILLIANT IDEAS.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.682
START THE CLOCK.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.466
I AM GOING
TO CORYANA,

05:36.510 --> 05:40.122
I AM SAVING THEM,
I AM SAVING KATE,

05:40.165 --> 05:42.516
AND I'M SAVING
MY DAMN SELF.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.873
HUH! HUH! HA!

05:51.916 --> 05:53.353
I FEEL GOOD. I'M SORRY.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.006
I HAVEN'T FELT
THIS GOOD IN MONTHS.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.834
OK. EASY THERE,
TIGER.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.532
THE FASTER YOU WORK
THE ADRENALINE
THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM,

05:58.575 --> 06:00.969
THE FASTER IT RETURNS
TO SELF-DESTRUCT MODE.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.188
24 HOURS WAS A GUESS,
NOT A PROMISE.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.451
OK.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.148
ALICE'S
TRANSPONDER DIED

06:06.191 --> 06:07.671
OVER THIS TINY SECTION
OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.238
BUT I DON'T SEE
AN ISLAND.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.979
YEAH. THAT'S THE POINT.
IT'S RIGGED TO AVOID

06:11.022 --> 06:12.459
SATELLITE DETECTION,

06:12.502 --> 06:14.112
SO IF I HAD THE ONLY
SERUM ON THE PLANET

06:14.156 --> 06:16.419
THAT COULD CURE CANCER
AND WANTED TO CLOAK IT

06:16.463 --> 06:17.899
SO NOBODY ELSE
COULD HAVE IT,

06:17.942 --> 06:19.988
I WOULD USE ANTI-RADAR
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.598
SO THE COWL'S LENSES
CAN DETECT

06:21.642 --> 06:23.165
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.819
CONSIDER IT
YOUR BULL'S-EYE.

06:24.862 --> 06:27.212
-BULL'S-EYE FOR WHAT?
-THESE ARE EMP GRENADES.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.040
SO ACCORDING TO SOPHIE,
THE ONLY ELECTRICITY

06:29.084 --> 06:30.651
THAT SHE SAW
ON THE ISLAND WAS USED

06:30.694 --> 06:33.001
FOR ELECTRIC
WRIST RESTRAINTS.

06:33.044 --> 06:36.961
SO A FEW OF THESE
WILL KNOCK OUT THE POWER
FOR A FEW HOURS

06:37.005 --> 06:38.876
AND FREE ANYONE
WEARING THEM,

06:38.920 --> 06:41.226
PRESUMABLY MARY'S DAD,
SOPHIE, AND KATE.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.098
OK. YOU DIDN'T
ANSWER MY QUESTION
ABOUT THE BULL'S-EYE.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.404
I GOT TO FIND YOU A RIDE.

06:46.493 --> 06:51.672
OK. UM, CAN I ADDRESS
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM?

06:51.715 --> 06:54.544
YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO DIE.

06:54.588 --> 07:00.594
ACTUALLY...THE ELEPHANT
IS IF I LIVE.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.292
SAY I FIND KATE
AND I BRING HER BACK HERE.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.642
THEN WHAT?
SHE'S BATWOMAN, RIGHT?

07:05.686 --> 07:07.078
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

07:07.122 --> 07:08.645
THAT'S NOT GONNA--

07:08.689 --> 07:10.212
KATE WOULD NEVER PUSH
YOU OUT LIKE THAT.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.127
SO THEN THERE'S
TWO BATWOMEN?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.998
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT CONFUSING.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.348
LOOK. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS

07:16.392 --> 07:18.220
WHEN KATE COMES BACK.

07:19.874 --> 07:23.225
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I...

07:23.268 --> 07:27.447
I REALLY, REALLY
WANT HER BACK.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.274
I KNOW.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.105
BUT...

07:34.149 --> 07:36.499
IF I DO DIE...

07:38.545 --> 07:41.722
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF MY BABY.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.855
OH. NO, NO, NO.
NOPE.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.292
THAT'S NOT...ME.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.643
YES.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.341
ANGELIQUE GAVE HER
TO ME,

07:52.384 --> 07:54.691
AND I WAS GONNA GIVE HER
TO MY MOM

07:54.735 --> 07:57.912
WHEN WE MOVED
INTO OUR PLACE.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.131
SHE'S ALL I HAVE LEFT
OF HER.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.790
WELL, THEN IT'S
OFFICIAL.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.924
YOU DEFINITELY
HAVE TO MAKE IT BACK

08:09.967 --> 08:12.187
BECAUSE...I COULDN'T
EVEN KEEP

08:12.230 --> 08:16.017
MY TAMAGOTCHI ALIVE
FOR 5 MINUTES,

08:16.060 --> 08:18.236
SO...

08:18.280 --> 08:20.717
I THINK I JUST
FOUND YOU A RIDE.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.241
OK. AND?

08:23.285 --> 08:27.245
UH...LET'S JUST SAY
I COULDN'T ORDER YOU
THE VEGAN OPTION.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.990
YOU COULDN'T
EVEN AFFORD COACH?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.644
WE'RE JUST LUCKY
THIS MAIL CARRIER'S

08:34.688 --> 08:36.559
GONNA FLY WITHIN
5 MINUTES OF CORYANA'S
AIRSPACE.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.866
-CLOCK'S TICKING.
-YEAH. 18 HOURS TO LIVE.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.694
I GOT IT!

08:40.737 --> 08:42.304
NO. I MEAN, YOU'RE
ABOUT 25 MINUTES
FROM THE DROP.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.740
THE WHAT NOW?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.133
I CAN OVERRIDE THE DOOR
SENSOR AND BUY YOU

08:45.176 --> 08:46.656
A 30-SECOND WINDOW
FOR THE HALO JUMP.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.918
WHAT--WHAT THE HELL
IS A HALO JUMP?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.224
HIGH ALTITUDE,
LOW OPENING.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.834
YOU ASKED
ABOUT THE BULL'S-EYE.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.619
YOU NEED TO HIT
A TINY TARGET
FROM 33,00 FEET.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.186
YEAH, YEAH. THIS
WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

08:55.230 --> 08:57.188
IF WE HAD A BATPLANE.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.625
THAT'S WHAT I'VE
BEEN SAYING.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.061
OK. I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT
AFTER I WORK OUT

09:00.104 --> 09:01.671
THE KINKS IN THE BATSUB.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.151
DON'T DEPLOY YOUR CUTE
UNTIL YOUR HEADS-UP DISPLAY

09:03.194 --> 09:04.631
READS 3,500 FEET
SO YOU AVOID DETECTION.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.067
OH, AND USE
YOUR PRESSURE MASK.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.677
OTHERWISE, YOU'LL
DIE INSTANTLY.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.462
IS THIS A BAD TIME
TO SAY I HAVE N-N-NEVER

09:10.506 --> 09:12.377
BEEN ON A PLANE BEFORE?

09:29.220 --> 09:32.702
TATIANA INFORMED ME
THE TWO OF YOU HAD
A LITTLE CHAT.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.443
OF COURSE SHE DID.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.533
THAT SHE TOLD YOU
HOW YOU AND OCEAN
FELL IN LOVE,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.404
HOW HE STOLE
A DESERT ROSE,

09:39.448 --> 09:42.494
AND HOW HE CONVINCED YOU
TO LEAVE CORYANA WITH HIM.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.453
THAT WAS
THE GIST OF IT

09:44.496 --> 09:46.629
LESS A FEW JUICY DETAILS
ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T

09:46.673 --> 09:49.414
THE ONLY ISLANDER
WHO LOVED ME.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.073
I WANT TO BE CLEAR
ABOUT SOMETHING.

09:56.117 --> 09:59.207
I CONSIDERED OCEAN
A BROTHER.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.079
I HAD YOU BOTH ERASED
FROM EACH OTHER
BECAUSE I...

10:02.123 --> 10:04.560
BELIEVED YOU WERE
A BAD INFLUENCE ON HIM.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.607
GOT IT.

10:09.130 --> 10:12.612
A RULER DOESN'T GET TO
PLAY BY THE WHIMS
OF HER EMOTIONS, ALICE.

10:15.919 --> 10:19.488
NOR CAN SHE AFFORD
TO BE BLIND TO WHAT'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

10:23.187 --> 10:26.626
YOU'VE DISAPPOINTED ME.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.366
I BROUGHT YOU
YOUR BROTHER

10:28.410 --> 10:31.892
WITH YOUR FANCY KNIFE
THROUGH HIS CHEST.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.545
NOW GIVE ME MY SISTER

10:33.589 --> 10:35.939
SO I CAN PUT ONE
THROUGH HERS.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.203
YOU FOOLISH GIRL.

11:01.182 --> 11:04.141
MY MEN FOUND A TRACKER
ON YOUR BOOT.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.799
YOU WERE BEING FOLLOWED.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.068
YOU OK?

11:18.112 --> 11:21.071
I THINK SO.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.638
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?

11:28.513 --> 11:31.038
EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.348
NOT HOW YOU SAW THIS GOING?

11:39.263 --> 11:41.091
ARE YOU
KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?!

11:45.313 --> 11:47.358
THERE'S NOTHING
DOWN THERE!

11:47.402 --> 11:48.620
YES, THERE IS,
AND YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.057
YOU NEED TO JUMP.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.275
WELL, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.842
WHAT IF MY CHUTE
DOESN'T OPEN?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.801
IT WILL! RYAN, HURRY UP!
IF YOU MISS YOUR WINDOW,

11:54.844 --> 11:56.454
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN,

11:56.498 --> 11:58.413
AND THERE'S NO SHARK REPELLANT
ON THE UTILITY BELT.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.067
-WELL, WHY NOT?
-BECAUSE THAT'S STUPID.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.372
NOW GO!

12:01.416 --> 12:03.984
OHH! OK. OK.
YOU GOT THIS.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.203
YOU GOT THIS!
COME ON!

12:06.247 --> 12:07.770
LET'S GO!

12:16.910 --> 12:18.738
♪ HERE COME
THE SKELETONS ♪

12:18.781 --> 12:20.870
♪ CRAWLING OUT YOUR CLOSET

12:20.914 --> 12:22.829
♪ THEY GRAB YOUR ANKLES
WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING ♪

12:22.872 --> 12:24.918
♪ TRY TO LOCK IT

12:24.961 --> 12:28.225
♪ OPEN YOUR MOUTH,
BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A SOUND ♪

12:28.269 --> 12:30.880
♪ THE WALLS TUMBLE DOWN,
TRY TO BREATHE ♪

12:30.924 --> 12:32.752
-THERE IT IS.
-WHOA, WHOA. I CAN'T WATCH.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.971
YOU'RE BREAKING THROUGH
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELD.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.588
OK. I SEE TWO
UNIQUE HEAT SIGNATURES.

12:43.632 --> 12:44.851
THEY COULD BE RESTRAINTS.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.809
DEPLOY YOUR CHUTE
AND THE EMPs.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.266
WHY ARE WE HERE?

13:09.310 --> 13:11.138
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE ALICE
WANTS YOU TO HAVE

13:11.181 --> 13:15.011
A FRONT ROW SEAT
TO WATCH HER KILL KATE.

13:15.055 --> 13:18.188
SHE'S HERE
AT SAFIYAH'S REQUEST.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.538
ME? WHAT DID I DO?

13:20.582 --> 13:22.627
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU DID.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.543
IT'S WHAT SAFIYAH THINKS
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

13:25.587 --> 13:30.810
YOU'RE SKILLED, STRONG,
AND MOST OF ALL, LOYAL.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.812
SHE WANTS YOU TO JOIN
HER ARMY.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.552
HA HA HA!

13:34.596 --> 13:38.121
WHY THE HELL
WOULD I JOIN AN ARMY
OF RUTHLESS KILLERS?

13:38.165 --> 13:41.777
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY
A PART OF ONE.

13:43.692 --> 13:48.566
HIS. BOTH GROUPS
ARE ORGANIZED, ARMED,

13:48.610 --> 13:52.266
AND...DANGEROUS,

13:52.309 --> 13:55.225
BUT WE ARE COMMITTED
TO PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE

13:55.269 --> 13:58.272
WHILE YOU OPPRESS YOURS.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.903
WHOA! OHH!

14:20.947 --> 14:22.992
TOUCHDOWN. I MADE IT.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.084
OH. OH. SORT OF.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.607
SEE? THAT WASN'T
SO BAD.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.914
OH, YEAH.
YOU OWE ME A SPA DAY.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.481
JUST REMEMBER TO
CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY,

14:33.524 --> 14:35.352
OR YOUR VITALS
WILL DROP AGAIN.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.708
WHOA!

14:43.752 --> 14:45.972
YOU SEEING THIS?

14:46.015 --> 14:49.584
OHH! THAT MUST BE
THE DESERT ROSE.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.413
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
MORE BEAUTIFUL IN MY LIFE.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.896
-RYAN?
-CRAP.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.636
RYAN?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.421
HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME?

15:02.466 --> 15:05.469
THE EMPs MUST HAVE
KNOCKED OUT THE COMMS.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.735
OH.

15:10.779 --> 15:13.956
HEY. I'M BATWOMAN.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.436
UM...

15:15.479 --> 15:17.394
IS YOUR QUEEN CHICK
AVAILABLE?

15:23.096 --> 15:24.836
WE'RE REALLY
DOING THIS, HUH?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.577
OH, BOY. HYAH!

15:31.713 --> 15:34.455
I EXPECTED THIS
TO FEEL DIFFERENT.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.674
I'M SURE YOU
CAN ASK YOUR GAL PAL
ENIGMA

15:36.718 --> 15:39.895
TO ROOT AROUND YOUR
HEAD AND FIX IT FOR YOU.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.419
NOW GIVE ME KATE.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.161
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU WANT TO KILL HER.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.076
SHE BETRAYED ME.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.470
THAT'S WHAT YOU KEEP
TELLING YOURSELF,

15:49.513 --> 15:54.431
BUT MAYBE DEEP DOWN
IN THE DANGEROUS MUSINGS
OF YOUR ID,

15:54.475 --> 15:55.955
THERE'S A COMPULSION
TO KILL HER

15:55.998 --> 15:57.869
BECAUSE SHE'S
MORE LOVED THAN YOU,

15:57.913 --> 15:59.654
AND IF YOU KILL HER,

15:59.697 --> 16:01.830
AS IRRATIONAL AS IT SOUNDS,

16:01.873 --> 16:04.746
YOU THINK THAT LOVE
WILL TRANSFER TO YOU.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.145
BUT THAT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS,

16:12.188 --> 16:13.929
SO THE CONSCIOUS PART
OF YOU USES FEELINGS

16:13.973 --> 16:19.065
LIKE PAIN AND HURT
AND BETRAYAL TO JUSTIFY IT,

16:19.108 --> 16:21.197
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL THOSE MESSY FEELINGS

16:21.241 --> 16:22.851
WHEN KATE'S DEAD

16:22.894 --> 16:25.723
AND EVERYONE STILL
HATES YOU?

16:25.767 --> 16:29.814
YOU ARE NOT CHANGING
MY MIND.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.947
I HAVE FANTASIZED
ABOUT KILLING
MY SISTER

16:31.991 --> 16:35.646
SINCE SHE LOCKED ME
IN ARKHAM.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.953
I KNOW WE'VE HAD
OUR DIFFERENCES, ALICE,

16:37.997 --> 16:41.870
BUT I DO CARE ABOUT YOU.

16:41.913 --> 16:45.178
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.790
MORE THAN THE AIR
I BREATHE.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.837
AS YOU WISH.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.319
I WILL TAKE YOU TO HER.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.894
IF I HAD A NICKEL
FOR EVERY BAD PENNY.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.591
BATWOMAN?

17:09.941 --> 17:12.292
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

17:12.335 --> 17:15.599
WE BELIEVE
SHE WAS TRYING TO HELP
OUR PRISONERS ESCAPE.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.080
THEY'RE GONE.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.909
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

17:20.952 --> 17:22.998
IT WILL BE...

17:23.042 --> 17:24.782
BECAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA HELP ME,

17:24.826 --> 17:26.436
AND IN RETURN,
I'M GONNA TELL
YOU SOMETHING

17:26.480 --> 17:28.786
YOU'RE GONNA
WANT TO HEAR.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.398
I SEE. UNFORTUNATELY,
I DON'T BARTER

17:31.441 --> 17:33.661
WITH UNINVITED GUESTS,
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,

17:33.704 --> 17:36.881
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.320
YOU SURE THAT'S
YOUR BOY OVER THERE?

17:40.363 --> 17:42.322
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK
A LITTLE HARDER.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.589
ENOUGH WITH ALL
THESE DISTRACTIONS.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.330
I GAVE YOU OCEAN,
AND, UM, NOW

17:50.373 --> 17:51.983
YOU CAN GIVE ME
KATE.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.129
MY QUEEN,
I HAD NO IDEA.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.653
THAT WAS CLEARLY
HER INTENTION.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.916
WHO IS THIS?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.223
A NOBODY.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.530
WELL, A--A BODY.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.923
UM, JUST ONE THE MORGUE
WOULDN'T MISS.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.537
YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIM, DON'T YOU?

18:26.409 --> 18:28.150
PUT HER WITH THE BAT

18:28.194 --> 18:30.457
AND FIND ME OCEAN.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.429
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

18:46.473 --> 18:47.865
BATWOMAN.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.650
LOOKS LIKE
AN EMP BLOCKER.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.826
PROBABLY HOW THE CUFFS
DISARMED.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.871
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SICK.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.309
DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
AN IN WITH BATWOMAN'S
DOCTOR.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.746
THAT DESERT ROSE
I NEED TO SNAG,
IT'S FOR HER.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.182
YOU WORKING WITH HER?

19:00.226 --> 19:01.618
I'M NOT WORKING
WITH HER.

19:01.662 --> 19:02.967
I'M JUST NOT
WORKING AGAINST HER.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.230
WHO IS SHE?

19:04.273 --> 19:06.667
HONESTLY, I HAVE
NO IDEA.

19:06.710 --> 19:10.192
I DON'T, SIR,
BUT SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO HELP US TO FIND KATE,

19:10.236 --> 19:11.802
WHO OBVIOUSLY
INSPIRED HER TO RISK

19:11.846 --> 19:13.239
HER LIFE
FOR TOTAL STRANGERS.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.198
I DON'T SEE THE HARM
IN US TEAMING UP.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.200
EXCEPT THE CROWS
AND BATWOMAN ABIDE

19:18.244 --> 19:20.550
BY TWO VERY DIFFERENT
IDEOLOGIES.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.161
BECAUSE WE'RE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR
OUR ACTIONS

19:22.204 --> 19:24.380
AND SHE'S NOT?

19:24.424 --> 19:26.556
IF THAT WERE
ACTUALLY TRUE,

19:26.600 --> 19:28.993
THOSE AGENTS WHO PLOWED
DOWN WOLF SPIDER
ON THAT TARMAC

19:29.037 --> 19:30.604
THE OTHER NIGHT
WOULDN'T HAVE JUST
BEEN FIRED.

19:30.647 --> 19:32.127
THEY'D BE IN JAIL.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.085
NOW YOU SOUND LIKE ONE
OF SAFIYAH'S LACKEYS.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.957
YOU KNOW I LOVE
MY JOB, SIR,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.524
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
WE STOP PRETENDING

19:37.567 --> 19:39.961
WE'RE NOT
ABOVE THE LAW.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.531
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.576
AMMONIUM NITRATE.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.230
AS IN THE BOMB-MAKING
CHEMICAL?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.840
THAT'S ONE USE FOR IT.

19:49.884 --> 19:53.366
ALSO MAKES A VERY EFFECTIVE
FERTILIZER.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.194
TO GROW THE DESERT ROSE.

19:55.237 --> 19:58.719
COME ON. KATE'S GOT TO
BE AROUND HER SOMEWHERE.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.031
ERR!

20:11.427 --> 20:14.561
I WAS WONDERING
HOW THIS PLACE COULD
SUCK HARDER.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.569
WHY ARE YOU EVEN
HERE?

20:22.612 --> 20:25.267
TO STOP YOU
FROM KILLING KATE.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.270
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS OBSESSION IS
WITH MY SISTER,

20:28.314 --> 20:30.925
BUT YOU'RE NOT PART
OF OUR FAMILY SOAP, 'KAY?

20:36.235 --> 20:40.326
OH. I SEE.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.371
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY OUT.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.678
YOU'VE GOT A FEW HOURS
LEFT TO LIVE,

20:44.721 --> 20:46.854
AND YOU NEED KATE
TO TAP BACK IN

20:46.897 --> 20:50.379
BECAUSE GOD FORBID
THE BAT EARS GO
UNOCCUPIED

20:50.423 --> 20:51.902
FOR 5 MINUTES!

20:51.946 --> 20:53.382
SO PEOPLE LIKE YOU
CAN ROAM FREE AND KILL

20:53.426 --> 20:55.166
THEIR OWN SIBLINGS?

20:55.210 --> 20:57.212
NOT TO PLAY MONDAY
MORNING QUARTERBACK,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.258
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO KILL KATE,

20:59.301 --> 21:01.042
YOU SHOULD HAVE
STOPPED ME WHEN
YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.653
HEH HEH.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.264
THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO FOLLOW

21:05.307 --> 21:09.398
YOUR DUMB ASS
TO THIS GODFORSAKEN ISLAND.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.227
THE TRACKER WAS YOU.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.185
HEH HEH.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.928
CLEVER GIRL.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.930
THAT'S IT?

21:19.974 --> 21:21.845
I JUST ROYALLY
SCREWED UP A MOVE

21:21.889 --> 21:24.065
YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING
FOR MONTHS.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.981
YOU COULD END ME RIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU JUST HIT ME

21:27.024 --> 21:29.331
WITH A LOUD SIGH.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.941
YOU'RE ALREADY
ON DEATH'S DOOR.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.552
LET'S LET NATURE RUN
ITS COURSE.

21:32.595 --> 21:35.337
OR MAYBE YOU'RE
TERRIFIED.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.731
OF KILLING
A SKY RAT?

21:37.774 --> 21:39.863
OF KILLING YOUR SISTER.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.779
YOU'VE BEEN THROWING
THE SAME TANTRUM FOR MONTHS,

21:42.823 --> 21:46.479
POISONING BATS,
ATTACKING GOTHAM SQUARE,

21:46.522 --> 21:49.003
KILLING GOD KNOWS
HOW MANY PEOPLE

21:49.046 --> 21:52.354
BECAUSE IF KATE
WAS GONNA DIE

21:52.398 --> 21:54.138
SHE WAS GONNA DIE
YOUR WAY,

21:54.182 --> 21:56.576
AND HERE YOU ARE
MOMENTS AWAY

21:56.619 --> 21:58.229
FROM GETTING WHAT YOU WANT

21:58.273 --> 22:02.146
EXCEPT...IT'S NOT ACTUALLY
WHAT YOU WANT, IS IT?

22:03.713 --> 22:07.848
YOU DON'T WANT KATE BACK
TO KILL HER.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.632
YOU JUST WANT HER BACK.

22:11.939 --> 22:16.422
HEH. WELL, SOMEONE
HAS SPENT AN AWFUL
LOT OF TIME THINKING

22:16.465 --> 22:20.382
ABOUT THE GIRL THEY
BLAME FOR THEIR
MOM'S DEATH.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.559
YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
TO ME ON YOUR WAY OUT?

22:23.603 --> 22:26.606
YOU SAID...

22:26.649 --> 22:29.260
"IT'S NOT MY FAULT,"

22:29.304 --> 22:33.264
BUT YOU WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT KILLING MY MOM.

22:33.308 --> 22:39.053
YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT WHY YOU ARE
THE WAY YOU ARE

22:39.096 --> 22:42.665
BECAUSE AS DARK
AND SCREWED UP AS YOU ARE,

22:42.709 --> 22:45.059
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

22:45.102 --> 22:47.627
YOU'RE A VICTIM
OF SOMEBODY, TOO...

22:49.106 --> 22:52.632
AND THAT TINY SLIVER
OF HUMANITY

22:52.675 --> 22:55.765
WON'T LET YOU KILL
YOUR SISTER

22:55.809 --> 22:57.898
BECAUSE THEN IT IS
YOUR FAULT.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.040
IF YOU WANT
KATE, SHE'S YOURS.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.782
YOU'VE TRAVELED
TOO FAR TO LEAVE
EMPTY-HANDED.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.222
WHEN SOMEONE
DOES ME A FAVOR,

23:18.266 --> 23:21.574
I ALWAYS REACT
IN KIND.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.968
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE IN RETURN
FOR HELPING ME?

23:25.012 --> 23:27.667
I'VE BEEN POISONED.

23:27.710 --> 23:31.105
I WANT ENOUGH DESERT ROSE
TO CURE MYSELF.

23:31.148 --> 23:34.021
-SO BE IT.
-AND I WANT TO TAKE KATE KANE

23:34.064 --> 23:35.849
BACK TO GOTHAM...

23:38.634 --> 23:40.114
ALIVE.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.205
YOU GAVE ME ONE THING.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.163
IN FAIRNESS, I'M
OFFERING YOU THE SAME.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.644
THE FLOWER OR THE GIRL--

23:48.688 --> 23:50.951
CHOOSE ONE.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.567
THE FLOWER.

23:58.611 --> 23:59.960
DONE.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.052
I SUPPOSE THAT LEAVES
KATE FOR YOU.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.510
ENOUGH WITH THE GAMES.
WHERE IS SHE?

24:28.554 --> 24:30.599
I WILL BRING YOU
TO HER

24:30.643 --> 24:32.775
ONCE YOU'VE FULFILLED
YOUR END OF THE DEAL.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.650
WHAT IS THIS?

24:37.693 --> 24:40.391
IT'S YOUR
SECOND CHANCE.

24:40.435 --> 24:41.915
IF YOU WANT KATE,

24:41.958 --> 24:44.265
YOU'RE GOING TO
KILL HIM,

24:44.308 --> 24:45.658
THE REAL HIM.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.314
DID YOU DO THIS?

24:50.358 --> 24:52.229
I DIDN'T TELL HER
ANYTHING.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.927
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.059
WE CONFISCATED
HER PHONE,

24:56.103 --> 24:57.887
FOUND A SEARCH
FOR A CHARMING,
LITTLE SHANTYTOWN

24:57.931 --> 25:00.803
IN PORTOFINO,
AND THERE YOU WERE.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.805
ISN'T THAT PRECIOUS?

25:04.807 --> 25:08.594
SHE WAS GOING TO
COME FIND YOU.

25:08.637 --> 25:11.640
I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE
THEIR PIAZZETTA.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.642
SUCH A SWEET,
LITTLE LOVE STORY

25:13.686 --> 25:15.296
THAT ENDS TODAY.

25:25.828 --> 25:27.351
I GAVE BATWOMAN
A CHOICE,

25:27.395 --> 25:29.571
AND NOW I'LL DO
THE SAME FOR YOU.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.487
YOU CAN HAVE ONE--

25:32.531 --> 25:35.751
OCEAN OR KATE.

25:46.196 --> 25:48.068
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WATCHING FOR THE FEED
TO COME BACK ONLINE.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.113
I AM. IT'S NOT.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.594
MARY, IT'S A PLANT.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.425
IT'S RYAN'S PLANT,

25:57.468 --> 25:59.296
SOMETHING SHE'S
MANAGED TO KEEP ALIVE

25:59.340 --> 26:01.298
THROUGH HER MOTHER'S
DEATH,

26:01.342 --> 26:02.996
THROUGH A PRISON SENTENCE
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE,

26:03.039 --> 26:05.041
THROUGH A FAKE BRUCE WAYNE
TRYING TO KILL HER,

26:05.085 --> 26:06.869
AND NOW SHE'S OFF
SAVING KATE JUST SO
WE CAN DO WHAT,

26:06.913 --> 26:08.871
SHOW HER THE DOOR?

26:08.915 --> 26:10.525
GETTING BOTH KATE
AND RYAN BACK WOULD BE
A GREAT PROBLEM TO HAVE,

26:10.569 --> 26:11.874
MOSTLY BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN
THEY SURVIVED

26:11.918 --> 26:13.397
THIS HAIL MARY OF A PLAN.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.877
THEN KEEPING THIS
ALIVE IS LITERALLY

26:14.921 --> 26:16.879
THE LEAST I CAN DO.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.098
OH, MY GOD!

26:23.103 --> 26:25.018
YOU'RE ONE OF SAFIYAH'S
MANY ARMS.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.239
OUR QUEEN DOESN'T LIKE
TO BE FOLLOWED.

26:33.766 --> 26:38.205
UHH-AAH!

26:38.248 --> 26:39.510
HEY!

26:43.036 --> 26:44.559
HYAH!

26:49.216 --> 26:52.045
OK. OK. OH.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.568
THE ELEVATOR
TO THE CAVE IS OUT,

26:53.612 --> 26:55.222
-SO WE GOT TO TAKE THE STAIRS.
-WAIT.

26:55.265 --> 26:56.876
-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. RYAN'S PLANT.
-WHAT ABOUT IT?

26:56.919 --> 26:58.355
I CAN'T LEAVE IT.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.748
WE CAN GRAB IT LATER.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.315
HEY. YOU WANT TO
SEND HER A PICTURE,

27:01.358 --> 27:03.360
ASK HER IF SHE THINKS
WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB?

27:03.404 --> 27:04.840
RYAN WOULD WANT US
TO RUN AWAY FROM
A TRAINED ASSASSIN.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.581
SHE ASKED ME
FOR ONE THING, LUKE.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.235
OK. OK. FINE, MARY.
JUST GRAB THE DAMN THING.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.628
FINE!

27:11.194 --> 27:13.283
WANT TO ROCK, PAPER,
SCISSORS IT?

27:13.327 --> 27:15.024
NO!

27:16.286 --> 27:18.201
WHAT IS THIS
EVEN ABOUT?

27:18.245 --> 27:20.247
SOME B.S. FRAME JOB?

27:20.290 --> 27:22.205
YOU MADE HER BELIEVE
I KILLED OFF

27:22.249 --> 27:24.251
HER LITTLE GANG
AND BLEW UP
HER SISTER'S PLANE.

27:24.294 --> 27:27.080
WHY WOULD I STIR THINGS
UP BETWEEN YOU TWO?

27:27.123 --> 27:28.777
YOUR LITTLE
BRAIN WIPE WORKED.

27:28.821 --> 27:31.562
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ALICE
EXISTED UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.086
TELL HER!

27:37.307 --> 27:39.396
TELL HER, ALICE.
IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.616
I DIDN'T FRAME SAFIYAH.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.186
GIVE ME THE KNIFE.

27:55.108 --> 27:59.242
THIS WAS NEVER
ABOUT SOMEONE SETTING YOU UP.

27:59.286 --> 28:00.853
THIS WAS ABOUT ALICE
CARING ABOUT ME

28:00.896 --> 28:02.289
MORE THAN SHE CARED
ABOUT YOU

28:02.332 --> 28:04.334
AND YOUR INABILITY
TO LIVE WITH IT.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.687
KILL HIM, AND YOU CAN
HAVE YOUR SISTER.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.562
IS IT WORTH IT,

28:14.605 --> 28:17.521
KILLING ME JUST
TO KILL KATE?

28:17.565 --> 28:19.175
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO PUNISH HER,

28:19.219 --> 28:21.525
LEAVE HER HERE
TO ROT.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.026
I'M SORRY, OCEAN...

28:46.637 --> 28:49.118
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
KILL HER ANYMORE.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.759
NOW BRING ME TO KATE...

29:23.544 --> 29:26.416
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE
ON THIS ISLAND DIES.

29:32.727 --> 29:33.772
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

29:33.815 --> 29:36.426
SHE'S BLEEDING ALL
OVER THE DAMN PLANT.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.870
HEY. MARY!

29:46.697 --> 29:49.613
YOU LIFT, I GRAB.

29:49.657 --> 29:50.832
-COME ON.
-OK.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.489
OK. GRAB IT,
GRAB IT.

29:57.621 --> 29:58.884
-RUN!
-RUN!

30:01.277 --> 30:02.583
OI, OI.
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

30:02.626 --> 30:04.759
JULIA, WHEN DID YOU
GET BACK?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.587
WHO THE BLOODY HELL
IS THAT?

30:06.630 --> 30:07.893
UNH!

30:11.374 --> 30:13.463
OH. OK.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.258
WHERE'S SAFIYAH?

30:25.301 --> 30:27.738
SHE SAID SHE WOULD
BRING ME A DESERT ROSE.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.653
SHE WILL...

30:29.697 --> 30:33.396
ONCE SHE'S FINISHED
WITH ALICE.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.617
IT'S FINALLY TIME
FOR ALICE TO BE REUNITED

30:36.660 --> 30:38.837
WITH HER SISTER.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.891
SOMEONE CARE TO
EXPLAIN WHY I HAD TO DAGGER

30:49.935 --> 30:51.719
ONE OF SAFIYAH'S MINIONS?

30:51.762 --> 30:54.548
THE MANY ARMS FOUND OUT
WE TRACKED ALICE
TO CORYANA.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.855
COURTESY OF BATWOMAN,
WHO FOLLOWED HER THERE

30:56.898 --> 30:58.857
TO FIND KATE.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.684
GOT IT.

31:00.728 --> 31:04.253
UM, THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I'M HERE.

31:04.297 --> 31:07.126
I HAVE TO
APPLAUD YOU

31:07.169 --> 31:10.216
FOR PICKING YOUR OWN
SURVIVAL OVER KATE'S.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.653
TAKE IT
FROM AN ISLAND LIFER--

31:12.696 --> 31:15.961
SELF-SACRIFICE
IS OVERRATED.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.659
HEH.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.748
THAT'S NOT
WHY I DID IT.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.753
ALICE ISN'T GOING
TO KILL HER SISTER.

31:28.843 --> 31:31.150
I'M CURIOUS
HOW YOU KNOW THAT.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.328
I SAW IT
IN HER FACE.

31:35.371 --> 31:41.464
REVENGE, HATE,
ANGER, TH...

31:41.508 --> 31:43.292
THOSE ARE THE ONLY
EMOTIONS SHE KNOWS,

31:43.336 --> 31:45.381
SO SHE HIDES
BEHIND THEM.

31:45.425 --> 31:49.516
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

31:49.559 --> 31:53.041
ALICE ISN'T GOING TO
KILL HER SISTER TODAY.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.525
KATE?

32:00.831 --> 32:03.791
WHERE'S KATE?

32:03.834 --> 32:05.271
WHAT IS THIS?

32:07.186 --> 32:08.839
WHAT DID YOU DO?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.450
I HIRED A TEAM
TO RUN DOWN SOME LEADS

32:10.493 --> 32:12.191
FROM THE TIP LINE.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.628
WE FOUND...

32:14.671 --> 32:17.500
BODY PARTS OFF
THE COAST
OF BLUDHAVEN.

32:17.544 --> 32:22.331
MUST HAVE GOT CAUGHT
IN THE CURRENTS. UM...

32:22.375 --> 32:24.551
WHAT DO--WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BODY PARTS?

32:27.510 --> 32:30.731
THEY RAN THE DNA.

32:30.774 --> 32:34.387
NO. NO!

32:34.430 --> 32:36.432
WHERE IS SHE?

32:36.476 --> 32:38.434
WHERE IS MY SISTER?

32:40.306 --> 32:42.873
I NEVER HAD
YOUR SISTER, ALICE.

32:47.748 --> 32:51.143
THE DNA WAS HERS.
IT WAS KATE'S.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.974
I'M SO SORRY.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.758
KATE'S DEAD.

33:08.812 --> 33:12.512
ENN! NO! NO!

33:12.555 --> 33:14.514
NO! NO!

33:14.557 --> 33:16.081
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

33:16.124 --> 33:19.867
NO! KATE! NO! NO!

33:19.910 --> 33:22.696
LET ME GO!

33:22.739 --> 33:25.568
OHH! YOU BLEW UP
HER PLANE!

33:25.612 --> 33:29.268
YOU KILLED HER,
YOU STUPID, LYING BITCH!

33:29.311 --> 33:31.487
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HER PLANE,

33:31.531 --> 33:33.707
BUT WHEN SOMEONE
TRIED TO FRAME ME FOR
KILLING YOUR SISTER,

33:33.750 --> 33:36.840
I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY
TO GET WHAT I WANTED,

33:36.884 --> 33:39.539
TO MAKE YOU AND OCEAN
PAY FOR YOUR BETRAYAL.

33:39.582 --> 33:42.107
YOU ARE A MONSTER!

33:42.150 --> 33:43.891
AND I CREATED YOU,

33:43.934 --> 33:45.936
SO WHAT DOES THAT
MAKE YOU?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.116
GET HER OFF MY ISLAND.

33:51.159 --> 33:55.163
NO. NO! NO! NO!

33:55.207 --> 33:57.774
AAH! AAH!

34:02.127 --> 34:03.693
ARE YOU SEEING THIS?

34:03.737 --> 34:06.000
THIS IS GONNA GET US
OUT OF HERE.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.350
-YOU KNOW HOW TO FLY?
-USED TO.

34:08.394 --> 34:10.439
I'LL GET THIS RUNNING.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.788
I'LL KEEP LOOKING
FOR KATE.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.573
GIVE ME AN HOUR.
JUST...

34:13.616 --> 34:15.792
-IF WE'RE NOT BACK--
-I'LL FIND YOU. GO.

34:24.279 --> 34:28.022
WELL DONE, MY QUEEN.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.503
THIS SHOULD SERVE
AS A LESSON TO ANYONE

34:30.546 --> 34:32.896
WHO DECIDES TO
BETRAY YOU.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.388
WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING?
HE WAS DEAD.

34:46.432 --> 34:47.955
WHEN THE BLADE
WAS MOLDED,

34:47.998 --> 34:50.218
ITS MOLTEN WAS IMBUED
WITH THE DESERT ROSE.

34:50.262 --> 34:53.917
ITS CURATIVE PROPERTIES
SEALED OCEAN'S ARTERIES
UPON ITS ENTRANCE.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.184
WELCOME BACK, BROTHER.

34:59.227 --> 35:02.361
THAT BREATH IN YOUR CHEST
IS ONLY THERE BECAUSE OF ME.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.450
I GAVE YOU YOUR LIFE BACK.

35:09.324 --> 35:12.153
WHY WOULD YOU DO
THIS TO ME?

35:12.197 --> 35:15.983
WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,
ALICE DOESN'T ACTUALLY
HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.725
I WANTED YOU TO
SEE THAT.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.553
YOU'RE SICK.

35:20.596 --> 35:23.991
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
JUST PUT A KNIFE
THROUGH YOUR HEART.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.862
ALICE'S LOYALTY WILL ALWAYS
LIE WITH HER SISTER

35:25.906 --> 35:28.517
JUST AS YOURS SHOULD LIE
WITH ME

35:28.561 --> 35:30.215
BECAUSE LOYALTY IS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

35:30.258 --> 35:31.955
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
TATIANA?

35:33.783 --> 35:35.872
IT IS, MY QUEEN.

35:41.835 --> 35:43.402
THEN WHY TEST IT?

35:45.404 --> 35:50.017
WHY AFTER I GAVE YOU
POWER AND FREEDOM
AND HEALTH

35:50.060 --> 35:53.629
WOULD YOU PICK A FIGHT
WITH ALICE ON MY BEHALF?

35:53.673 --> 35:54.935
SAFIYAH, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT--

35:54.978 --> 35:57.155
YOU SLAUGHTERED
ALICE'S GANG.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.983
YOU SENT HER A NOTE
SAYING I KILLED KATE.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.029
YOU REELED HER BACK
INTO MY LIFE.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.987
WHY WHEN YOU KNOW
HOW HARD I WORKED
TO FORGET HER?

36:04.031 --> 36:05.989
BUT YOU NEVER
FORGOT HER.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.861
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.123
YOU COULDN'T.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.387
YOU WERE IN LOVE.

36:14.433 --> 36:17.305
I WAS...TRYING
TO GET RID OF THAT
TOXIC AN--

36:17.349 --> 36:19.046
ENOUGH!

36:22.049 --> 36:25.313
YOU ALWAYS HATED ALICE
AND TRIED TO DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN US.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.925
-THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT WAS YOU.
-NO. NO.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.362
YOU WANTED TO SEE
HER LOSE,

36:30.405 --> 36:32.929
AND NOW YOU HAVE.

36:32.973 --> 36:35.062
CONGRATULATIONS, TATIANA.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.369
I HOPE YOU WERE
ENTERTAINED!

36:44.811 --> 36:47.857
KEEP THAT IN HER.

36:47.901 --> 36:50.556
I'LL PULL IT OUT
WHEN I DECIDE TO FORGIVE HER.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.926
AGH!

37:16.973 --> 37:19.062
♪ THE HOUSE IS BURNING

37:19.106 --> 37:22.414

38:13.682 --> 38:17.599
YOU ARE HERE.
ARE YOU OK?

38:17.643 --> 38:20.167
DID YOU GET
A DESERT ROSE?

38:20.210 --> 38:23.562
I WAS WONDERING WHY
MY GUARD LEFT HIS POST.

38:26.565 --> 38:29.045
LOOKS LIKE IT WASN'T
MEANT TO BE.

38:32.222 --> 38:35.313
WE NEED TO FIND KATE
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.360

KATE WAS NEVER
ON THIS ISLAND.

KATE DIED
IN THE PLANE CRASH.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.431
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.215
I DON'T WANT TO
BELIEVE IT EITHER.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.349
THE FEED'S BACK ON.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.962
IS THAT THE DESERT ROSE?

39:16.005 --> 39:17.616
BLOODY HELL.
IT'S ASHES.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.748
OH, THIS
ISN'T HAPPENING.
WE NEEDED THAT.

39:19.792 --> 39:22.316
RYAN NEEDED THAT TO LIVE.

39:25.450 --> 39:29.062
OH. OH, MY GOD.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.588
THE COMMANDER THINKS HE
CAN HOTWIRE THE PLANE.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.155
WE NEED TO GO.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.685
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.470
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

39:47.297 --> 39:50.475
I'VE ONLY GOT
A FEW HOURS.

39:50.518 --> 39:53.086
THERE'S NOTHING
THERE FOR ME.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.788
WILL YOU SIT
WITH ME?

39:59.832 --> 40:01.747
PLEASE.

40:03.226 --> 40:05.272
I DON'T WANT TO
DIE ALONE.

40:19.460 --> 40:22.158
I'M SORRY WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

40:24.987 --> 40:27.337
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.301
IT'S BECAUSE
I WASN'T KATE.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.672
HELLO?

40:57.716 --> 40:59.805
SOPHIE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

40:59.848 --> 41:01.981
HOW IS MY PHONE
SUDDENLY WORKING?

41:02.024 --> 41:03.809
THE EMPs THAT
KNOCKED OUT THE POWER
MUST HAVE EXPIRED,

41:03.852 --> 41:06.855

BATWOMAN ON THE COMMS.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.378
I'M WITH HER NOW.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.815
YOU NEED TO GET HER
BACK TO GOTHAM.

41:09.858 --> 41:11.643
SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO LEAVE.

41:11.686 --> 41:14.341
TELL HER TO GET
HER ASS BACK HERE NOW!

41:14.384 --> 41:16.517
I HAVE A CURE!

41:37.407 --> 41:38.974
IT'S OUR
BIRTHSTONE.

41:39.018 --> 41:42.500
RED IS
A VERY SYMBOLIC COLOR.

41:42.543 --> 41:43.936
LET'S
TAKE A PICTURE, BETH.

41:43.979 --> 41:45.154
MAKE SURE OUR NECKLACES
ARE IN IT.

41:45.198 --> 41:46.547
READY? CHEESE!

42:14.401 --> 42:16.316
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
