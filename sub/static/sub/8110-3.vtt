THEY HAVE A CURE
FOR THAT, YOU KNOW?

IT'S CALLED A COMPUTER.

WE DONE FOR THE DAY,

00:43.111 --> 00:44.478
OR DO I NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO READ?

00:44.512 --> 00:47.215
I'M DONE.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.184
IT'S DONE.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.486
NO WAY.
IT'S FINISHED?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.188
WELL, HOW--HOW'S IT END?

00:54.222 --> 00:55.523
I MEAN, YOU GOT
TO LET ME READ IT.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.725
NOT THIS TIME.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.094
W--YOU AT LEAST GOT
TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.329
COME ON.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.631
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH
THE NEXT BOOK IF YOU DON'T--

01:03.664 --> 01:07.168
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE
A NEXT BOOK.

01:07.201 --> 01:11.472
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
WHY?

01:11.505 --> 01:12.773
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.308
TRY ME.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.384
I JUST CAN'T
DO IT ANYMORE.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.354
I'M NOT BRAVE LIKE YOU.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.191
BUT WRITING'S
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.326
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT IT?

01:32.360 --> 01:36.164
WHAT I SHOULD
HAVE DONE YEARS AGO.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.331
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:37.365 --> 01:38.732
PUT IT DOWN, OR I'LL--

01:38.766 --> 01:41.335
I'LL MAKE YOU.

01:41.369 --> 01:44.672
HOW, JACK?

01:44.705 --> 01:47.208
YOU DON'T EVEN EXIST.

01:49.577 --> 01:52.413
I'M SORRY.

TO SLEEP WITH YOU" MORE?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.971
PENGUIN OR BEAVER?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.973
BEAVER. BEAVER. BEAVER.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.841
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S TOO HIGH SCHOOL.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.577
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO PISS CUDDY OFF?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.612
I CAN'T BE ROMANTIC?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.747

FROM A WOMAN IN A COMA.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.384
WE'RE FINE.
NEVER SEEN HER HAPPIER.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.952
YEAH? HOW ABOUT YOU?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.021
I'M...WORRIED.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.623
BECAUSE SHE'S HAPPY?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.024
NO, BECAUSE I AM.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.025
HOUSE, THAT'S--

03:45.058 --> 03:47.628
IRONIC? WEIRD? CRAZY?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.797
I WAS GOING
TO SAY NORMAL.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.432
FOR NOW.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.666
WE'RE IN
THE HONEYMOON PERIOD.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.736
OUR BRAINS ARE FLOODED
WITH ENDORPHINS.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.937

WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

03:57.971 --> 03:59.907
IN AN ADULT RELATIONSHIP.

03:59.940 --> 04:03.911
NAME ONE THING THAT CUDDY AND I
HAVE IN COMMON BESIDES WORK.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.314
THERE'S...

04:06.347 --> 04:07.548
YOU'RE BOTH...

04:07.581 --> 04:08.549
WAIT.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.950
EXACTLY.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.986
LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS
ARE BASED ON COMPATIBILITY,

04:13.020 --> 04:14.855
AND RIGHT NOW
WE ONLY HAVE SEX.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.724
HOUSE,
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK

04:16.757 --> 04:18.592
SHE'D DUMP YOU
BECAUSE YOU, WHAT,

04:18.626 --> 04:19.960
DON'T DO YOGA?

04:19.993 --> 04:21.295
LISTEN TO THE B-52s?

04:21.329 --> 04:22.930
NOT RIGHT AWAY.

04:22.963 --> 04:26.634
WE'LL FIGHT, MAKEUP SEX,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
FIGHT, MAYBE SEX,

SO, INSTEAD OF ENJOYING
THE HONEYMOON PHASE,

04:34.775 --> 04:36.910
YOU'VE DECIDED
TO SKIP IT ENTIRELY.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.580

THAT WE BOTH LIKE DOING

TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.519
NO, THEN SHE'LL START
PRETENDING TO LIKE THINGS

04:45.553 --> 04:47.588
THAT SHE REALLY DOESN'T
JUST TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.022
WHICH WILL MAKE HER
FEEL EVEN WORSE,

04:49.056 --> 04:51.792
WHICH WON'T BE MY FAULT,
SO I'LL RESENT HER,

04:51.825 --> 04:54.027
AND THAT WON'T BE HER FAULT,
SO SHE'LL RESENT ME.

TILL THE BITTER END.

WHY YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME?

EXAMINED YOU YET.

WRONG WITH ME.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.745

05:11.779 --> 05:13.814

ALL THEY CARE ABOUT
IS WHO'S HOTTER,

05:33.834 --> 05:34.835
JACK OR DEACON.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.537

CAN'T LOVE BOTH OF THEM.

COMING ALONG?

ONE QUESTION.

ABOUT ANYTHING?

ANYTHING.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.030

06:03.063 --> 06:04.898
WHO KIDNAPPED HIS UNCLE...

THIS WOMAN IS ON A 72-HOUR
PSYCHIATRIC HOLD.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.957
IF SHE TRIES TO RUN,
SHOOT HER.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.958
WITH A SEDATIVE.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.026
THAT'S MORE CONVENIENT.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.038
YOU CALLED US
BACK TO WORK

06:45.072 --> 06:47.441
BECAUSE A LADY
MIGHT HAVE HAD A SEIZURE.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.010
A SEIZURE WHILE TRYING
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.044
SO SEND HER
FOR A PSYCH EVAL.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.013
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH US?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.948
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
HUMAN BEING WHO'S SUFFERING.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.455
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

07:01.489 --> 07:05.759
SHE IS ALSO THE WRITER OF
JACK CANNON: BOY DETECTIVE,

07:05.793 --> 07:07.628
BELOVED BY MILLIONS
AROUND THE WORLD.

BY GIRLS BETWEEN
10 AND 14.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.567
LOOK, THE POINT IS

07:13.601 --> 07:14.935
IF SHE KILLS HERSELF,

07:14.968 --> 07:17.204
MILLIONS OF FANS
OF ALL AGES AND GENDERS

07:17.237 --> 07:19.106
WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.874
SO WE'RE TAKING THIS CASE
'CAUSE YOU'RE A FAN?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.910
NO, THAT WOULD BE CRAZY
AND UNPROFESSIONAL.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.712
YOU'RE TAKING THIS CASE
'CAUSE I SAID SO.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.013

DO A FULL WORKUP.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.581
OBSERVE HER OVERNIGHT.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.650
SEE IF SHE HAS ANOTHER SEIZURE.
YOU CAN GO.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.884

GET THE NIGHT OFF?

07:30.918 --> 07:33.821
BECAUSE HE BROUGHT
A SMOKIN' HOT BABE.

I HAVE PLANS
WITH MY WIFE.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.262
YEAH, NICE TRY,

07:42.295 --> 07:43.931
BUT YOU HATE
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.200
AND YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T HAVE ONE.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.637
HEY.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.972
I'D STAY MYSELF,

07:52.005 --> 07:54.675
BUT I JUST
BOUGHT THE FLOWERS.

RESERVATION FOR DOMINICA'S
ISN'T TILL 8:00,

07:58.546 --> 07:59.813
SO WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.149
WE NEED TO PICK SOMETHING UP
FROM A HAUNTED HOUSE?

08:02.182 --> 08:04.918
THIS IS A GOTHIC
REVIVAL MASTERPIECE.

08:04.952 --> 08:08.021
I HOPE ONE DAY TO LIVE
IN A HOUSE LIKE THIS.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.632

HER LATEST MANUSCRIPT.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.573
ALICE TANNER.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.040
WHY DOES THAT NAME
SOUND FAMILIAR?

08:27.074 --> 08:30.110
I GAVE YOU A COUPLE OF HER BOOKS
A FEW YEARS AGO.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.048
NO.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.285
SHE'S THE WOMAN
YOU PUT ON THE PSYCH HOLD.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.286
THIS ISN'T A DATE.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.954
WE'RE ON A CASE.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.923
EVER HEAR OF MULTITASKING?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.792
DID YOU STEAL HER KEYS?

08:44.825 --> 08:47.728
THINK I'D TAKE THE DEAN
OF MEDICINE ON A "B" AND "E"?

08:47.761 --> 08:51.665
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

08:51.699 --> 08:54.101
WELL, I GUESS
YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.237
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST
PHYSICAL?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.906
A WHILE AGO.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.676
I DON'T LIKE DOCTORS.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.712
ANY HISTORY OF SEIZURES
BEFORE TODAY?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.279
NOT THAT I RECALL.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.181
ARE WE ALMOST DONE?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.950
I'M TIRED.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.918
THE EXAM WOULD GO FASTER

09:10.951 --> 09:12.953
IF YOU WOULD COOPERATE
WITH US.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.354
I AM.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.790
YOU'RE EVADING
EVERY QUESTION WE ASK.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.225
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.027
THAT.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.663
I DIDN'T ASK FOR HELP.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.098
COMMITTING A SUICIDAL GESTURE
SAYS OTHERWISE.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.100
IT WASN'T A GESTURE.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.235
I HAD THE DAMN SEIZURE

09:28.268 --> 09:31.004
BEFORE I COULD GET
THE GUN IN MY MOUTH.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.040
YOU WANT TO TELL US WHY?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.241
YOU WANT TO KNOW
MY LIFE STORY,

09:34.274 --> 09:36.877
MY SECRET, INNER PAIN?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.612
MAYBE IF I JUST
OPEN UP A LITTLE,

09:38.646 --> 09:41.281
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE ME?

09:41.314 --> 09:43.717
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.788
THANK YOU.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.989
I WANT A WOMAN DOCTOR.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.357
AND BACK TO BEING EVASIVE.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.060
IT'S MY RIGHT AS A PATIENT.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.896
SO PLEASE GET OUT.
NOW.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.030
WE NEED TO OBSERVE YOU
OVERNIGHT.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.832
YOU REALLY THINK
I'M STUPID ENOUGH

09:58.866 --> 10:00.868
TO TRY AND KILL MYSELF
IN A HOSPITAL?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.335
TO SEE IF YOU HAVE
ANOTHER SEIZURE.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.937
WE'LL BE UP THERE,

10:03.971 --> 10:05.939
AND WE WON'T DISTURB YOU
UNLESS THERE'S A PROBLEM.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.140
THAT WORK FOR YOU?

10:07.174 --> 10:10.110
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

10:11.679 --> 10:15.683
HOUSE, CHRISTINA HAS AGREED
TO NOT CALL THE POLICE.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.184
SHE'S PROBABLY ILLEGAL.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.820
SAME REASON SHE DIDN'T
REPORT THE SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.288
I CALL 911.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.123
BUT WHEN MISS TANNER
WOKE UP,

10:23.156 --> 10:23.924
SHE SAY SHE WILL FIRE ME

10:23.957 --> 10:25.859
IF I SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE GUN.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.128
AND IF SHE WHACKS HERSELF,
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR JOB?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.200
I THINK SHE'S A VERY
DEPRESSED PERSON.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.367
NEVER GOES OUT,

10:34.401 --> 10:36.169
DOESN'T HAVE FRIENDS.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.706
SHE HAS ALL THIS MONEY,

10:38.739 --> 10:40.073
BUT ALL SHE DOES IS WRITE.

10:40.107 --> 10:43.777
I NEED TO SEE
HER LATEST MANUSCRIPT.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.680
SHE ALWAYS LOCKS UP
HER WRITING IN THERE.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.882
HAS SHE EVER COMPLAINED

10:48.916 --> 10:51.985
ABOUT PHYSICAL PAIN
OR STRESS?

10:52.019 --> 10:52.820
YES.

10:52.853 --> 10:56.023
HER BACK AND HER HANDS
HURT A LOT.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.925
A WRITER
WITH BACK AND HAND PAIN.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.793
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.
LET'S GO.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.162
SOMETIMES I HEAR HER
CRY AT NIGHT.

11:02.195 --> 11:05.465
WHEN SHE THINKS
NOBODY'S LISTENING.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.035
I SHOULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.436
TRUE.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.806
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.942
BEFORE THERE WERE
HARD DRIVES,

11:14.975 --> 11:17.277
THERE WERE...

11:26.053 --> 11:28.088
HOW MANY OF THESE
DOES SHE EAT A DAY?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.089
TWO FOR LUNCH.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.391
SOMETIMES THREE.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.933
STILL NO SEIZURE ACTIVITY.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.201
IT'S YOUR TURN--

11:41.234 --> 11:43.370
[snoring]

11:43.403 --> 11:44.371
[cane bangs glass]

11:44.404 --> 11:45.438
WHAT THE HELL?

11:45.472 --> 11:49.877
CLOSE. HOUSE.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.111
SHE'S FINE.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.413
BOTH THE E.E.G. AND ALL
HER VITALS HAVE BEEN--

12:00.453 --> 12:01.822
YOU.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.156
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:03.190 --> 12:06.927
YOU WET THE BED.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.996
JUST NOT SURE HOW YET.

12:16.336 --> 12:21.041
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.442
WELL,
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

12:22.475 --> 12:25.112
I DIDN'T GET
ANY SLEEP EITHER.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.214
UNILATERAL
HYPERHIDROSIS.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.215
INTERESTING.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
SHE ALSO ADMITTED
SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.084
BUT WON'T TELL US WHY.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.786
HOUSE SEARCHED HER HOME,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.554
FOUND SHE'S BEEN EATING TWO
CANS OF TUNA A DAY FOR YEARS.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.156
MERCURY POISONING?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.124
(House)
EXPLAINS THE SEIZURES,

12:37.157 --> 12:38.491
HAND AND BACK PAIN,

12:38.525 --> 12:40.027
ALSO THE DEPRESSION.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.962
EXPLAINS EVERYTHING EXCEPT
THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.163
WE GOT HER URINE
AND BLOOD SAMPLES BACK.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.197
THEY'RE NORMAL.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.398
(Chase)
IF IT'S LOW LEVEL,

12:45.432 --> 12:46.466
IT MIGHT NOT SHOW UP
IN A SPOT CHECK.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.368
WE NEED TO RUN
CONTINUOUS TESTING TO FIND IT.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.003
WE CAN'T.
SHE WANTS A FEMALE DOCTOR.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.972
SHE ONLY ASKED FOR A WOMAN
TO WASTE TIME.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.475
SHE'S COOPERATING JUST ENOUGH
TO GET THROUGH THE PSYCH HOLD.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.979
PUT SOME LIPSTICK ON CHASE
AND START CHELATION THERAPY.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.014
CONFIRM WITH ANOTHER
URINE TEST.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.217
OKAY.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.919
I'LL GO TALK TO CUDDY.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.221
MAYBE SHE'LL LET US
BORROW A DRESS TOO.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.568
AHE--AHEM.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.204
THIS WOULD BE ME
IGNORING YOU.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.173
WHAT IF WE GOT ARRESTED
LAST NIGHT?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.141
AND WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO KEEPING

13:28.175 --> 13:30.177
OUR PROFESSIONAL
AND PERSONAL LIVES SEPARATE?

13:30.210 --> 13:33.113
I'M NOT THE ONE TALKING
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP AT WORK.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.115
WHAT'S BEHIND YOUR BACK?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.251
PEACE PENGUIN.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.053
WHAT ROOM
SHOULD I RETURN IT TO?

13:40.087 --> 13:41.221
243.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.522
I NEED SOME HELP
WITH ALICE TANNER.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.291
SHE WANTS A VAGINA.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.060
I'M PRETTY ATTACHED
TO MINE.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.930
I TOLD YOU TO HIRE A TEMPORARY
REPLACEMENT FOR THIRTEEN

13:49.963 --> 13:50.931
TWO WEEKS AGO.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.165
I'VE BEEN BUSY.
DOING WHAT?

13:52.199 --> 13:54.134
YOU.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.368
SO YOU'LL TALK HER
OUT OF IT?

13:55.402 --> 13:58.005
YOU'LL HIRE
A WOMAN DOCTOR?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.206
YOU THINK
WE JUST SIT AROUND

13:59.239 --> 14:01.241
TALKING SPORTS
AND BELCHING AND FARTING

14:01.274 --> 14:02.375
WHEN THE CHICKS
AREN'T AROUND?

14:02.409 --> 14:03.543
[belches]
BY WHEN?

14:03.576 --> 14:04.544
NEXT WEEK.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.914
NEXT WEEK IT IS.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.950
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT'S MERCURY?

14:09.983 --> 14:10.884
YOUR SYMPTOMS.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.153
NOW I CAN PERFORM
THE PROCEDURE YOURSELF

14:13.186 --> 14:15.422
IF YOU STILL PREFER
A WOMAN DOCTOR,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.557
BUT THE TEAM YOU HAVE
IS OUR BEST.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.227
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
PERFUME YOU'RE WEARING.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.995
IT WAS A GIFT.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.932
FROM DR. HOUSE?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.934
IT WAS ALL OVER HIM
LAST NIGHT.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.601
IF YOU'D PREFER
ANOTHER FEMALE DOCTOR,

14:28.635 --> 14:30.270
I CAN ARRANGE THAT AS WELL.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.240
I ALSO SMELLED IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE MORE RECENTLY.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.243
FAINT,
BUT UNMISTAKABLE.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.111
YOU SHOULD HAVE WORN

14:38.145 --> 14:41.148
A DIFFERENT CARDIGAN
THIS MORNING, CHRISTINA.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.151
SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL ME, DEAR?

14:44.184 --> 14:47.354
WHEN I FOUND YOU
YESTERDAY,

14:47.387 --> 14:50.190
I THOUGHT
I WAS TOO LATE.

14:50.223 --> 14:54.061
I TALKED TO THEM SO I
COULD HELP YOU GET BETTER.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.196
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU SUFFER ANYMORE.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.265
THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.267
YOU'RE FIRED.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.169
THIS WOMAN
CARES ABOUT YOU.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.636
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HER--

15:03.670 --> 15:05.338
I WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW,
WOULD I?

15:05.372 --> 15:07.207
I SHOULD HAVE
DONE IT YESTERDAY.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.043
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE IN PAIN,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.512
BUT LASHING OUT
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.513
TREATMENT IS.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.148
I AGREE.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.217
SEND THE MEN BACK.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.188
AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT A BUNCH
OF DEWY-EYED CRY-BABIES.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.357
WHAT'S THAT?

15:24.391 --> 15:29.262
IT'S THE NEW
JACK CANNON NOVEL.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.497
SUGGESTIONS?

15:30.530 --> 15:31.498
YEAH.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.499
STOP.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.967
IT CAN'T BE DONE.

15:34.001 --> 15:37.370
PEOPLE WONDER WHY
YOU'VE NEVER CURED CANCER.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.607
DID YOU GET THIS BEFORE
OR AFTER YOUR DATE WITH CUDDY?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.410
EH, PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
BEEN A WISER CHOICE.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.212
HUH.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.580
THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD,
HOUSE.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.416
SHE'S COMMITTING CRIMES.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.483
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

15:50.517 --> 15:52.986
I'M A HORRIBLE INFLUENCE.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.187
TRUE.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.089
A HORRIBLE INFLUENCE
SHE'S REACHING OUT TO.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.590
SHE'S LOOKING FOR WAYS
TO CONNECT.

15:57.624 --> 16:02.162
SURE, THEY'RE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE,
JUVENILE, AND INSANE,

16:02.195 --> 16:04.697
BUT SO ARE YOU.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.000
YOU DO HAVE SOMETHING
IN COMMON.

16:07.034 --> 16:11.071
YOU'RE BOTH TRYING TO FIND
THINGS YOU HAVE IN COMMON.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.507
AND NOT FINDING THEM.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.013
YOU DON'T LOOK SO HOT.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.515
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.517
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.530
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?

16:37.564 --> 16:38.698
MYSELF.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.033
IF YOU'RE SEEING THINGS,

16:40.067 --> 16:41.068
IT COULD BE ANOTHER SYMPTOM.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.435
IT'S NOT.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.637
IT'S ONLY
IN MY IMAGINATION.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.207
I MAKE THINGS UP
FOR A LIVING.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.078
AND TALKING TO THEM?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.580
IT'S A WRITER THING.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.648
WE'RE ALSO GOOD
AT READING PEOPLE.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.218
LIKE YOU,
FOR INSTANCE.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.752
RECENTLY DIVORCED.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.721
YOU SLEPT WITH A GIRL
LAST NIGHT.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.523
HER PLACE, NOT YOURS.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.126
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
RETURN HER CALLS.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.162
THAT...

17:12.565 --> 17:14.234
HOW?

17:14.267 --> 17:17.070
THE TAN LINE FROM
YOUR FORMER WEDDING RING.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.172
YOU STINK OF SMOKE,

17:19.206 --> 17:22.175
BUT NO YELLOW
ON YOUR FINGERS OR TEETH

17:22.209 --> 17:23.810
MEANS SHE'S THE SMOKER.

17:23.843 --> 17:27.380
AND YOU EITHER DIDN'T
SHOWER OR CHANGE.

17:27.414 --> 17:31.451
EITHER WAY, HER PLACE.

17:31.484 --> 17:32.852
DO HIM.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.487
WE'RE WASTING TIME,

17:34.521 --> 17:36.423
WHICH IS HER MAIN GOAL HERE.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.790
NEED YOUR ARM FOR THIS.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.759
YOU REMIND ME
OF MY EX-HUSBAND.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.363
A CUTE MAN, BUT PROBLEMS
IN THE BEDROOM DEPARTMENT.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.368
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.736
THE ONES I CAUGHT HIM IN.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.439
HE CHEATED ON ME
EVERY CHANCE HE COULD.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.542
THE FIRST TIME
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.609
THE SECOND...

17:56.643 --> 17:59.812
THE BASTARD.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.681
[gasps]

18:01.714 --> 18:03.616
BP AND HEART RATE
ARE SPIKING.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.119
MUST BE AN ALLERGIC REACTION
TO THE CHELATION AGENT.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.255
I DIDN'T
GIVE IT TO HER YET.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.425
(Chase)
PAIN, SEIZURES,
HYPERHIDROSIS,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.461
AND SUDDEN ONSET OF
RADICALLY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.529
HER CONTINUOUS BLOOD AND URINE
TEST CAME BACK.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.731
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
MERCURY POISONING. CLEAN.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.667
COULD BE HEMOLYTIC
UREMIC SYNDROME.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.170
(Foreman)
IT'S NOT. THERE WEREN'T ANY
BLOOD OR PROTEIN MARKERS

18:23.203 --> 18:24.404
IN HER URINE, EITHER.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.805
(Taub) WE ALSO CAUGHT HER
TALKING TO HERSELF.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.307
SHE COULD BE DELUSIONAL.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.475
(Foreman) SHE'S A WRITER
AND A RECLUSE.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.277
I'D BE MORE SURPRISED IF
SHE DIDN'T TALK TO HERSELF.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.144
YOU DONE PLAYING
WITH YOUR RIBBON?

18:31.178 --> 18:33.546
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
WHEN IT HAPPENED?

18:33.580 --> 18:34.447
SITTING IN BED.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.184
SHE CLAIMS IT WAS ONLY
IN HER IMAGINATION,

18:37.217 --> 18:38.185
BUT STILL.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.452
WHEN HER BP SPIKED?

18:39.486 --> 18:42.255
COMPARING TAUB
TO HER EX-HUSBAND.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.456
SHE REALLY HATED THE GUY.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.658
HER FIRST SYMPTOM

18:45.692 --> 18:48.628
WAS WHEN SHE HAD A GUN
TO HER HEAD.

18:48.661 --> 18:52.432
EXCESS ADRENALINE
COULD EXPLAIN SEIZURES

18:52.465 --> 18:54.467
AND SKYROCKETING BP.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.169
A PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.171
GET AN MRI
AND FIND IT.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.849
WOULD YOU HOLD THIS?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.924
I MEANT NOW.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.732
HAVE I MENTIONED
I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.968
HAVE I MENTIONED
WE DON'T CARE?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.370
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.305
NOTHING.
JUST A LEG CRAMP.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.874
[gasps]

19:34.907 --> 19:36.409
[screaming]

19:36.443 --> 19:37.944
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
SHE'S GOT METAL IN HER LEG.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.618
SHE HAS THREE SCREWS
IN HER RIGHT LEG

19:45.652 --> 19:47.954
FROM A SKIING ACCIDENT
SHE DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.257
THE MRI'S MAGNETIC FIELD
SUPER HEATED THE METAL,

19:50.290 --> 19:51.658
CAUSING THIRD-DEGREE
BURNS.

19:51.691 --> 19:56.863
SKIN RUPTURED FROM
INTERNAL HEAT PRESSURE HERE.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.731
IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.832
SHE SIGNED
THE CONSENT FORMS,

19:59.866 --> 20:00.967
DENIED THERE
WAS ANY METAL...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.635
NORMALLY I'D SAY IT.

20:02.669 --> 20:06.973
MAYBE THIS WAY
IT'LL FINALLY SINK IN.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.908
SHE WANTS TO DIE.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.411
YOU CANNOT TRUST
ANYTHING SHE SAYS.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.879
TREATING THE SOFT TISSUE
INJURIES IN HER LEG

20:12.912 --> 20:13.980
COST US MOST OF THE DAY.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.715
WE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE
THE SCREWS.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.917
AND FINDING
A PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

20:17.950 --> 20:19.819
WITHOUT USING THE MRI
COULD TAKE US A WEEK.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.821
LONGER, IF SHE DOESN'T
STOP LYING TO US.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.956
OR WE COULD FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO FIND IT

20:23.990 --> 20:27.460
IN THE 39 HOURS LEFT
ON HER PSYCH HOLD.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.529
WE NEED TO MAKE HER
COOPERATE.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.698
WE HAVE TO OFFER HER
SOMETHING SHE WANTS.

20:31.731 --> 20:35.968
SHE WANTS TO KILL HERSELF,
HOUSE.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.638
I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.383
I WANT YOU
TO WRITE MORE BOOKS.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.786
I'M DONE WRITING
JACK CANNON'S ADVENTURES.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.054
AND WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,

20:55.087 --> 20:57.990
I'LL JUST BE DONE.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.527
NOW DON'T YOU SAY THAT,
YOU DIRTY BIRDIE.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.928
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
EASIER WAYS TO GO

21:01.961 --> 21:03.530
THAN SHOOTING YOURSELF
IN THE HEAD

21:03.563 --> 21:04.764
OR TEARING APART A LIMB.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.800
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.570
THE BEST PART,
YOU'LL FEEL SO GOOD,

21:10.603 --> 21:13.540
YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
YOU'RE DEAD.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.375
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

21:15.408 --> 21:17.844
YOU'RE GOING TO
HELP ME KILL MYSELF?

21:17.877 --> 21:18.911
YOU'RE THE PERCEPTIVE ONE.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.847
YOU TELL ME.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.948
WHY?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.616
WE CAN'T FIND
YOUR TUMOR IN TIME

21:23.650 --> 21:26.986
WITHOUT YOUR COOPERATION.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.355
SO I'M GIVING YOU A CHOICE.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.457
GIVE US A CHANCE
TO MAKE YOU BETTER,

21:30.490 --> 21:33.960
OR STICK THIS ANYWHERE
AND PUSH.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.696
WHY DO YOU CARE ABOUT ME?

21:36.729 --> 21:40.967
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME
BECAUSE YOU READ MY BOOKS?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.569
NO.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.705
I KNOW PAIN.

21:45.738 --> 21:46.906
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT,

21:46.939 --> 21:49.742
AND ONE DAY YOU CAN'T.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.544
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

21:51.578 --> 21:54.881
YOU EITHER FIND REASONS
TO GO ON, OR YOU DON'T.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.083
I'M...

21:57.116 --> 21:59.051
I'M ALL OUT OF REASONS.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.119
NOW.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.921
WHEN YOU'RE PAIN FREE,

22:01.954 --> 22:04.991
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO LIVE
AND START WRITING AGAIN.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.927
AND IF I'M WRONG,

22:07.960 --> 22:11.931
GOT A BACKUP PLAN
TO TAKE HOME WITH YOU.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.801
OKAY.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.605
GOOD CHOICE.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.772
IF I WERE YOU,

22:19.806 --> 22:21.908
I'D HIDE THAT
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP IT.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.576
I KNOW THE PERFECT PLACE.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.093
[woman moans]

22:43.963 --> 22:44.931
MORNING, SUNSHINE.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.400
YOU'RE A REAL BASTARD.

22:47.434 --> 22:50.069
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO CHOOSE LIFE.

22:50.102 --> 22:54.040
YOU'RE ALSO
AN EXCELLENT LIAR.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.909
WASN'T LYING
ABOUT THE CURE.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.811
IF WE FIND AND REMOVE
THAT PESKY,

22:58.845 --> 23:01.781
ADRENALINE-SECRETING TUMOR,

23:01.814 --> 23:02.949
YOU'LL GET BETTER.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.984
YOU BETTER HURRY.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.087
MY LAWYER WILL HAVE ME
OUT OF HERE THIS TIME TOMORROW.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.590
YEAH, ABOUT THAT,

23:10.623 --> 23:11.758
IT SEEMS THAT LAST NIGHT

23:11.791 --> 23:13.560
YOU FOUND
AND SELF-ADMINISTERED

23:13.593 --> 23:16.195
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS
A POTENTIALLY LETHAL NARCOTIC.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.997
YOUR PSYCH HOLD
HAS BEEN EXTENDED

23:18.030 --> 23:19.999
AN ADDITIONAL 24 HOURS.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.401
I KNOW.
BUMMER, RIGHT?

23:25.104 --> 23:29.208
YOU WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT MY BOOK?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.209
SURE.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.613
JACK CANNON DIES.

23:33.646 --> 23:34.614
I KNOW.

23:34.647 --> 23:39.519
BUMMER, RIGHT?

23:39.552 --> 23:42.188
(Taub) WE FINISHED ANALYZING
THE PET SCANS FROM LAST NIGHT.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.556
THERE'S NO SIGN OF A TUMOR.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.224
WE SAMPLED BLOOD
FROM SIX DIFFERENT AREAS

23:45.257 --> 23:46.959
LOOKING FOR ANY SPIKES
IN ADRENALINE.

23:46.993 --> 23:47.994
ALL OF THEM
WERE NEGATIVE.

23:48.027 --> 23:48.961
IF SHE TOLD US
HER SYMPTOMS,

23:48.995 --> 23:50.930
WHERE IT HURTS,
WHEN THE PAIN FIRST STARTED,

23:50.963 --> 23:53.533
WE COULD AT LEAST FOCUS
ON A SPECIFIC AREA.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.101
(Chase) OR USE THEM
TO RULE AREAS OUT.

23:55.134 --> 23:55.968
SHE'LL ONLY LIE.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.937
WE'RE BETTER OFF
NOT EVEN TALKING TO HER.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.940
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET HER
TO TRY TO KILL HERSELF AGAIN?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.875
WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE TIME.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.044
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY
TO GET HER SYMPTOMS

24:05.077 --> 24:06.012
WITHOUT ASKING HER.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.615
IF WRITERS WRITE
WHAT THEY KNOW.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.850
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS ABOUT A BOY DETECTIVE.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.219
AND HIS MENTOR, AUNT HELEN,

24:13.252 --> 24:17.790
WHO HAPPENS TO BE AROUND
THE SAME AGE AS ALICE.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.892
ANSWERS COULD BE IN THE BOOK.

24:19.926 --> 24:24.130
GREAT. YOU FINISH READING
YOUR TYPEWRITER RIBBON YET?

24:24.163 --> 24:26.599
LOOK FOR THE TUMOR
WITH THE ULTRASOUND.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.238
I DROVE ACROSS TOWN
TO TREAT A RIBBON?

24:32.271 --> 24:33.540
THAT'S WHY I PREFER LYING.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.675
IT MAKES THINGS EASIER.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.110
WHATEVER HE HAS YOU DOING,
STOP.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.111
YOU TOLD HIM?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.647
WE DO LIVE TOGETHER.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.015
I GENERALLY TELL HIM
WHEN I SHOW UP AT HIS WORK.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.251
HE TOLD ME IT WAS A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.252
IT IS.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.254
PATIENT WANTS
TO KILL HERSELF.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.689
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO READ A BOOK,

24:49.722 --> 24:51.858
THE LATEST JACK CANNON:
BOY DETECTIVE.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.593
ALICE TANNER
IS YOUR PATIENT?

24:53.626 --> 24:54.894
YOU'RE A "FANNON" TOO?

24:54.927 --> 24:56.262
I'M TEAM DEACON.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.997
OH, COME ON.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.667
WHY CAN'T
SHE LOVE THEM BOTH?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.069
THE TYPEWRITER KEYS
SHOULD HAVE LEFT IMPRESSIONS

25:03.102 --> 25:04.771
ON THESE RIBBON FIBERS.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.939
THEY WOULD ALSO REMOVE
A LAYER OF INK.

25:06.973 --> 25:10.777
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF
TWEAKING THE SOFTWARE, REALLY.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.118
DOES CUDDY KNOW YOU'RE USING
THE MRI FOR THIS?

25:19.151 --> 25:21.053
LET'S SAY YES.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.060
SO DO YOU THINK JACK FINALLY

25:28.094 --> 25:29.596
HOOKS UP WITH SARAH
IN THIS ONE?

25:29.629 --> 25:31.831
NO. DEBBIE WRIGHT
IS HIS TRUE LOVE.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.801
SHE'S DEAD.
PRESUMED!

25:34.834 --> 25:36.202
ALL WE REALLY KNOW IS--

25:36.235 --> 25:38.605
THERE ARE ACTUAL PATIENTS
WAITING TO USE THIS MACHINE.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.172
[computer beeps]

25:44.811 --> 25:46.278
CONGRATULATIONS.

25:46.312 --> 25:49.148
IT'S A BOOK.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.589
WILSON JUST TOLD ME
WE'RE GOING ON A DOUBLE DATE

25:56.623 --> 25:58.290
WITH HIM AND SAM TONIGHT.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.192
YOU DON'T LIKE DOUBLE DATES?

26:00.226 --> 26:02.128
I'D JUST LIKE
IF YOU'D ASK ME FIRST.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.930
YOU DON'T LIKE SURPRISES?

26:03.963 --> 26:07.133
IS THIS ALICE'S BOOK?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.101
SAM REPROGRAMMED THE MRI

26:09.135 --> 26:11.604
TO READ ALICE'S
TYPEWRITER RIBBON.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.773
YOU USED A $3 MILLION
PIECE OF HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT

26:13.806 --> 26:15.074
SO YOU COULD READ A NOVEL?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.910
COOL, RIGHT?

26:17.944 --> 26:20.179
WELL, AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
I'M IMPRESSED.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.181
AS YOUR BOSS,
YOU'RE A JACKASS.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.016
DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.151
AS YOUR BOYFRIEND,
I THANK YOU.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.252
AS YOUR EMPLOYEE,
I RESENT YOU,

26:26.285 --> 26:27.386
BECAUSE I NEED THIS
FOR MY CASE.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.354
AS YOUR BOSS,

26:28.387 --> 26:31.924
YOU JUST GOT SIX MORE
CLINIC HOURS NEXT WEEK.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.060
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR TONIGHT?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.995
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I DON'T CARE.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.196
JUST PICK SOMETHING
WE'D BOTH ENJOY.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.865
YEAH? AND WHAT
WOULD THAT BE EXACTLY?

26:38.898 --> 26:39.999
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.034
I GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.375
FOUND SOMETHING.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.378
IT'S NOT A TUMOR.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.081
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S ENCASED AROUND HER HEART.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.123
(Chase) SHE HAS
A PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.391
(Taub)
WHICH WASN'T THERE LAST NIGHT

27:05.424 --> 27:06.392
WHEN WE DID THE PET SCAN.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.827
SHE'S GETTING WORSE,

27:07.860 --> 27:08.861
AND THERE'S NO SIGN
OF A PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.763
SEIZURES, SWEATING,
RAPID BLOOD PRESSURE,

27:10.797 --> 27:12.131
AND AN EFFUSION
POINT TO SOMETHING VIRAL.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.734
OR MAYBE A CANCER.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.235
WE COULD USE
YOUR OPINION, HOUSE,

27:16.268 --> 27:20.306
OR AT LEAST YOUR ATTENTION.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.876
JACK CANNON IS NOT DEAD.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.344
IT'S WORSE.

27:25.377 --> 27:28.848
TEN BOOKS LEADING UP
TO A FINAL CONFRONTATION.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.917
SHE ENDS IT
ON A CLIFFHANGER.

27:30.950 --> 27:31.751
I MEAN,
WHO DOES THAT?

27:31.784 --> 27:33.953
PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO SELL YOU THE 11TH.

27:33.986 --> 27:34.954
SHE WAS GONNA KILL HERSELF.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.756
THIS IS THE FINAL
JACK CANNON.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.290
NOTHING GETS RESOLVED.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.793
WHO'S HIS FATHER?
WHO KILLED HIS BROTHER?

27:40.827 --> 27:43.095
HOW'D HE GET THAT
DAMN SCAR ON HIS CHEEK,

27:43.129 --> 27:45.832
AND WHY IS HE
OBSESSED WITH YO-YOs?

27:45.865 --> 27:47.800
IS THERE ANYTHING IN IT
THAT PERTAINS TO OUR CASE?

27:47.834 --> 27:49.802
YEAH.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.972
I KNOW WHY SHE WANTED
TO KILL HERSELF.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.909
HIS MENTOR,
HELEN RUTHERFORD,

27:56.943 --> 27:59.311
HAS CONTRACTED
A SERIOUS ILLNESS

27:59.345 --> 28:01.981
WHICH CONSISTS
OF JOINT PAINT,

28:02.014 --> 28:04.884
FATIGUE,
SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT,

28:04.917 --> 28:07.119
AND DEPRESSION.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.122
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS MENTOR
CHARACTER'S REALLY ALICE?

28:10.156 --> 28:13.092
HELEN DIES
HALFWAY THROUGH THE BOOK.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.427
SHOOTS HERSELF IN THE HEAD...

28:15.461 --> 28:17.730
TO SAVE JACK
FROM HAVING TO CARE FOR HER.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.766
(Taub)
IF WE ADD THOSE
TO THE SYMPTOMS WE'VE SEEN

28:19.799 --> 28:22.802
AND THE PERICARDIAL
EFFUSION...IT'S LUPUS.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.772
CAN'T BE LUPUS.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.473
WHY NOT?

28:27.506 --> 28:29.141
IT ISN'T CURABLE.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.177
THAT'S...NOT AN ANSWER.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.745
IT'S TREATABLE.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.080
WE'LL START TESTING
TO SEE WHICH DRUGS

28:34.113 --> 28:35.447
SHE BEST RESPONDS TO.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.349
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO TAKE HER PAIN AWAY.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.985
SHE'S STILL GONNA
KILL HERSELF

28:39.018 --> 28:41.854
AS SOON AS SHE GETS
RELEASED TOMORROW.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.759
CAN'T LET JACK CANNON
END THIS WAY.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.228
WE'RE TREATING A PATIENT...
NOT A BOOK.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.268
RETEST TO CONFIRM.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.212
GO-CARTS? REALLY?

29:06.245 --> 29:08.180
WILSON, PARTY OF FOUR.
YOU GUYS ARE UP NEXT.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.949
YOUR MOM SAID
YOU LOVED GO-CARTS.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.885
YOU CALLED MY MOTHER.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.921
I LOVED THEM
WHEN I WAS 12.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.823
THIS IS SO COOL!

29:16.856 --> 29:18.557
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS
SINCE I WAS 12!

29:18.590 --> 29:21.560
WINNER PICKS THE RESTAURANT.

29:21.593 --> 29:25.231
I HAVE A VERY BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.766
[monotone]
ARE WE READY, RACERS?

29:32.872 --> 29:34.206
ON YOUR MARKS,

29:34.240 --> 29:35.875
GET SET...

29:35.908 --> 29:38.044
AND GO AWAY.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.351
HEY! WATCH IT!

29:47.920 --> 29:49.155
YOU HAVING FUN?

29:49.188 --> 29:51.357
YOU KNOW WHO WINS
THESE RACES?

29:51.390 --> 29:54.060
THE PERSON WHO WEIGHS LESS!

29:56.896 --> 29:59.832
MY PARENTS NEVER LET ME
DRIVE ONE OF THESE!

29:59.866 --> 30:01.500
YEAH! I CAN TELL!

30:03.335 --> 30:04.837
[bang]
OH, MY GOD!

30:04.871 --> 30:06.072
OH!

30:10.542 --> 30:11.878
OH!

30:15.347 --> 30:16.515
WHOA.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.286
WHAT IS HER PROBLEM?

30:20.319 --> 30:21.820
SHE HATES JEWS!

30:22.989 --> 30:25.892
NEVER...AGAIN.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.144
THAT A GIRL!

30:54.620 --> 30:57.156
OHH...
UH...

31:00.426 --> 31:02.228
HOO HOO HAH HAH HAH!

31:16.943 --> 31:18.410
SEE YOU AT THE FINISH LINE!

31:18.444 --> 31:19.578
OH, YEAH?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.999
[go-cart powers down]

31:43.069 --> 31:45.137
[wheels squealing]

31:50.642 --> 31:52.311
YES!

31:54.680 --> 31:56.215
HEY!

31:56.248 --> 31:57.984
YOU'RE BANNED FOR LIFE,
MISTER!

31:58.017 --> 32:01.053
YOUR FUN STOP PRIVILEGES
ARE OFFICIALLY REVOKED!

32:03.422 --> 32:05.992
YOU, TOO, BLONDIE!
ALL OF YOU--GET OUT!

32:06.025 --> 32:07.994
I AVENGED MY LADY.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.695
SEATBELT NEARLY
BROKE MY NECK.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.363
I'M DONE
FOR THE NIGHT.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.066
IT'S NOT MY FAULT WILSON'S
ATTRACTED TO PSYCHOS.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.667
YOU PICKED
THE PLACE.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.072
THAT'S JUST THE PAIN
TALKING.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.379
OH...WOW.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.524
IT WAS A CAR CRASH.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.725
NOT A SKIING ACCIDENT.

32:39.758 --> 32:40.726
WHAT?

32:40.759 --> 32:42.261
SCREWS IN YOUR LEG.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.696
[sighs]
YA GOT ME.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.432
I'LL BE GOING
BACK TO SLEEP NOW.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.600
YOU DAMAGED
YOUR THYROID GLAND IN THE CRASH

32:48.634 --> 32:51.203
WHEN THE SHOULDER STRAP
CUT INTO YOUR NECK.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.072
YOU DON'T HAVE LUPUS.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.540
WHAT YOU HAVE IS CURABLE.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.108
GO AWAY.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.046
I READ YOUR BOOK.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.780
SUCKS, BY THE WAY.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.583
NICE TRY,
BUT IMPOSSIBLE.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.619
HELEN RUTHERFORD
KILLS HERSELF

33:07.653 --> 33:09.221
BECAUSE SHE FEELS USELESS

33:09.255 --> 33:12.424
AND DOESN'T
WANT TO BE A BURD--

33:12.458 --> 33:14.126
JUST LIKE YOU DO NOW.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.195
YOU HAVE HYPOTHYROIDISM.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.297
THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL
SO TIRED AND WORN OUT.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.732
WITH MEDICATION,
YOU'LL FEEL 20 YEARS YOUNGER.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.134
OR WHATEVER AGE YOU WERE

33:22.168 --> 33:23.635
THE LAST TIME YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO KILL YOURSELF.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.737
HOW DID YOU--
YOU CAN FINISH
THE STORY THE RIGHT WAY...

33:25.771 --> 33:27.606
THE WAY JACK CANNON
DESERVES.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.709
YOU THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT JACK DESERVES?

33:30.742 --> 33:32.711
I KNOW THAT HE DESERVES BETTER
THAN WHAT YOU GAVE HIM.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.780
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM!

33:34.813 --> 33:36.415
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
LEAVE ME--

33:44.190 --> 33:45.657
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.626
I CAN'T MOVE.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.362
I CAN'T MOVE ANYTHING.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.270
HOW CAN I BE RIGHT
AND WRONG?

33:58.304 --> 34:01.073
I DEDUCED THE CAR ACCIDENT

34:01.107 --> 34:02.674
BECAUSE THYROID
FIT THE SYMPTOMS.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.611
BUT A DAMAGED THYROID
WOULDN'T EXPLAIN THE PARALYSIS.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.246
HOW CAN I BE WRONG
ABOUT THE THYROID

34:07.279 --> 34:08.714
BUT RIGHT ABOUT THE ACCIDENT?

34:08.747 --> 34:10.249
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT?

34:10.282 --> 34:12.284
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU THINK, KID.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.286
AT LEAST
NOT COMPLETELY.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.088
POST TRAUMATIC

34:16.122 --> 34:18.290
SYRINGOMYELIA FROM
A 15-YEAR-OLD CAR CRASH.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.226
SLOWLY GROWING OVER THE YEARS,

34:20.259 --> 34:22.161
PRESSING
AGAINST HER SPINAL COLUMN.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.863
CAUSES PAIN, FLUCTUATING
BLOOD PRESSURE, SEIZURES.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.265
AND IF UNTREATED,

34:26.298 --> 34:27.733
EVENTUALLY LEADS
TO PARALYSIS AND DEATH.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.169
(Taub)
WE FIND IT AND REMOVE IT.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.603
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO REGAIN FULL FUNCTION.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.505
IF WE CAN GET HER MEDICAL
RECORDS FROM BACK THEN,

34:33.539 --> 34:36.175
WE CAN USE THEM
TO PINPOINT THE LOCATION.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.609
DO IT.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.878
WE'RE DEAD ON OUR FEET.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.148
I'VE BARELY SLEPT
IN FOUR DAYS.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.382
AW...THAT'S SAD.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.184
YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN SADDER?

34:45.217 --> 34:47.186
THIRTEEN
WAS THE ONLY MAN ON MY TEAM.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.287
YEAH, IT'D BE NICE
IF YOU HURRY UP

34:48.320 --> 34:50.622
AND HIRE SOMEONE
TO FILL HER SPOT.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.291
DO IT.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.460
CUDDY WANTS IT
TO BE A GIRL.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.462
THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF PEOPLE--

34:56.495 --> 34:57.763
I WAS TALKING TO CHASE.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.466
I WAS JUST LOOKING AT YOU
TO SCREW WITH YOU.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.607
[ah-ah-hem]

35:08.640 --> 35:11.177
I'M MEDITATING.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.379
(Foreman)
FROM WHERE WE'RE STANDING,
IT LOOKED LIKE SLEEPING.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.714
WE CAN'T FIND HER OLD
MEDICAL RECORDS.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.183
YOU WOKE ME UP FOR THAT?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.251
WE WOKE YOU UP
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.453
ALICE IS REFUSING
ANY MORE TREATMENT.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.654
SHE DOESN'T WANT
THE SURGERY.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.756
(Taub)
SHE KICKED US OUT.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.195
WHY WOULD SHE LIE
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT?

35:29.228 --> 35:30.662
EVERYBODY LIES.

35:30.696 --> 35:34.132
EVERYBODY HAS A REASON.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.407
I KNOW.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.442
ALICE IS REFUSING
SURGERY.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.244
SHE'LL BE DEAD
IN A FEW DAYS WITHOUT IT.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.812
WHICH IS WHY I'VE SPENT
THE LAST FOUR HOURS

35:46.845 --> 35:50.682
TRYING TO FIND A LEGAL WAY
TO DO IT WITHOUT HER PERMISSION.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.519
UNSUCCESSFULLY.
I'M SORRY.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.455
AS YOUR BOYFRIEND,
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE EFFORT.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.856
AS YOUR EMPLOYEE,

35:57.889 --> 35:59.691
I'M DISAPPOINTED
AT YOUR INEFFECTIVENESS.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.864
WHY WOULD SHE NOT TELL US
ABOUT THE PINS IN HER LEG?

36:05.897 --> 36:08.500
'CAUSE SHE WANTS TO DIE.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.302
BY HAVING HER LEG
RIPPED OFF?

36:10.336 --> 36:13.205
SHE WANTS TO PUNISH HERSELF...

36:13.239 --> 36:15.407
FOR SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED
BEFORE SHE WAS FAMOUS,

36:15.441 --> 36:17.276
BEFORE SHE EVEN
STARTED TO WRITE.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.877
I THINK THE ANSWER'S

36:18.910 --> 36:19.945
IN HER OLD MEDICAL
RECORDS.

36:19.978 --> 36:23.515
BUT DOPEY, SLEAZY,
AND UPTIGHTY CAN'T FIND THEM.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.784
MAYBE ALICE TANNER'S
JUST HER PEN NAME.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.590
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS AN IDIOT.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.759
I'LL CONTACT
THE NATIONAL RECORDS ARCHIVE

36:33.792 --> 36:35.427
AND RUN THE TYPE
OF SCREWS IN HER LEG

36:35.461 --> 36:39.331
AGAINST BLOOD TYPE, AGE,
AND ANYTHING ELSE I THINK OF.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.799
HER FIRST NAME
COULD BE HELEN.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.934
EVEN BETTER.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.739
DON'T BOTHER TO GET UP.

36:47.773 --> 36:50.576
YOU KNOW,
THE WAY YOU WRITE JACK

36:50.609 --> 36:53.812
ALWAYS MADE HIM
FEEL REAL TO ME.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.381
NOW I KNOW WHY.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.951
BECAUSE
I'M A GOOD WRITER.

36:59.985 --> 37:03.289
HE'S COOL,
BUT HE'S AWKWARD.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.357
HE'S BRILLIANT.
HE MAKES MISTAKES.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.760
HE'S FUNNY, BUT SOMETIMES
HE TAKES IT TOO FAR.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.762
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT KID.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.831
PLEASE.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.600
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.503
YOU WEREN'T ALONE
IN THE CAR CRASH.

37:17.536 --> 37:21.373
YOUR SON WAS WITH YOU,
HELEN.

37:29.381 --> 37:32.718
THE BOOKS ARE YOUR WAY
OF KEEPING HIM ALIVE.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.358
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
LET ME DIE IN PEACE?

37:39.391 --> 37:41.860
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AT PEACE
SINCE IT HAPPENED.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.068
I KILLED HIM.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.504
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.374
I LET HIM DRIVE.

37:55.407 --> 37:58.076
HE ONLY HAD
A LEARNER'S PERMIT.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.646
IT WAS RAINING.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.848
I DESERVE THIS.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.451
NO, YOU DON'T.

38:08.687 --> 38:12.057
HE COULD ALWAYS GET ME
TO DO WHAT HE WANTED.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.528
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN MY MUSE.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.063
WELL, THAT MAY BE TRUE,

38:18.096 --> 38:19.831
BUT I'VE BEEN REVIEWING

38:19.865 --> 38:22.934
YOUR MUSE'S AUTOPSY RESULTS.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.337
IT WASN'T THE CRASH
THAT KILLED HIM.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.839
YOUR SON
HAD A BRAIN ANEURISM.

38:27.873 --> 38:30.075
THAT'S WHY HE CRASHED.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.043
HE WAS DEAD
BEFORE THE IMPACT.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.380
THERE WAS NOTHING
YOU COULD DO TO SAVE HIM.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.415
THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.649
THEY HAD NO REASON
TO DIG ANY DEEPER.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.051
IT WAS A CAR ACCIDENT.
I DID.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.588
IT'S EASY TO MISS.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.123
BUT YOU CAN SEE
THE BLOOD BUILDUP HERE.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.459
YOUR SON
WOULD HAVE DIED THAT DAY

38:47.493 --> 38:50.061
ON A BUS, IN SCHOOL,

38:50.095 --> 38:52.564
SITTING ON HIS BED.

38:52.598 --> 38:55.801
THE ONLY THING THE CRASH
IS KILLING IS YOU.

38:55.834 --> 38:59.471
WE NEED TO REPAIR
THAT SYRINX IN YOUR NECK.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.843
HE WAS MY WORLD.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.146
WRITING...

39:08.179 --> 39:10.849
I COULD FEEL HIM WITH ME.

39:14.786 --> 39:17.556
IT WASN'T MY FAULT,
MOM.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.894
AND IT WASN'T MINE.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.183
HER SON DIDN'T HAVE
A BRAIN ANEURISM.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.152
NOPE.

39:47.185 --> 39:50.188
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET HIM DRIVE IN THE RAIN.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.058
JACK WAS NEVER
VERY COORDINATED.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.760
AS YOUR BOSS,

39:54.793 --> 39:57.863
I AM OPPOSED TO YOU
LYING TO A PATIENT.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.831
AS YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
I'M GLAD YOU CARE.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.133
I DON'T.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.169
I JUST WANTED TO SAVE
JACK CANNON.

40:04.202 --> 40:07.773
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
YOU LIKE HIM.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.776
I STARTED READING
ONE OF THE BOOKS YOU GAVE ME.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.011
I FIND THAT
VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.145
WHY?

40:14.179 --> 40:15.747
BECAUSE I CAN'T LIKE
SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

40:15.781 --> 40:18.049
WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.185
BECAUSE I LIED ABOUT
GIVING YOU THE BOOKS.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.787
OH.
OH.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.524
WILSON TOLD YOU.
YEAH.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.459
HE'S SUCH A GOSSIP.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.728
I'M NOT GONNA DUMP YOU
BECAUSE WE LIKE DIFFERENT FOOD

40:29.761 --> 40:31.463
OR BOOKS OR MUSIC.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.964
ON THE OTHER HAND,

40:32.998 --> 40:35.166
I MIGHT DUMP YOU
IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME

40:35.200 --> 40:37.235
WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.170
I KNOW YOU
BELIEVE THAT NOW...

40:39.204 --> 40:41.106
BUT THE FACT IS--

40:41.139 --> 40:42.240
WHO CARES ABOUT COMMON?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.242
COMMON IS BORING.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.045
IT'S...COMMON!

40:47.078 --> 40:50.949
I LIKE BEING WITH YOU.
YOU MAKE ME BETTER.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.785
HOPEFULLY,
I MAKE YOU BETTER.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.187
WHAT WE HAVE IS...

40:56.221 --> 40:58.590
UNCOMMON.

41:01.126 --> 41:04.162
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.973
[door slides open]

41:17.543 --> 41:20.712
MIND GIVING US
A MOMENT ALONE, CHRISTINA?

41:27.986 --> 41:30.522
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.524
GREAT.

41:32.558 --> 41:35.026
YOU CAN DEDICATE
THE NEXT JACK CANNON TO ME.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.695
I CAN'T.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.864
ARE YOU STILL IN PAIN?
NO.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.833
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU SAID, AND MORE.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.069
I CAN FINALLY MOVE ON.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.937
THANK YOU.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.573
MOVE ON WHERE?

41:48.907 --> 41:52.110
I WANT TO WRITE BOOKS
FOR ADULTS.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.979
WHAT ABOUT JACK?

41:54.012 --> 41:56.815
YOUR LAST BOOK
DIDN'T ANSWER ANYTHING.

41:56.848 --> 42:00.118
THE WAY I ENDED JACK'S STORY
IS PERFECT.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.253
EACH READER CAN DECIDE

42:02.287 --> 42:05.323
WHAT FATE THEY WANT
FOR HIM THEMSELVES.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.158
YOU--BUT THAT'S STUPID!

42:07.192 --> 42:08.994
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE!

42:09.027 --> 42:12.330
HOW MANY ANSWERS
DO YOU GET IN REAL LIFE?

42:12.363 --> 42:13.965
THIS IS A BOOK.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.267
BOOKS HAVE BEGINNINGS,
MIDDLES, AND ENDS.

42:16.301 --> 42:17.969
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT
ON A CLIFFHANGER--

42:18.003 --> 42:18.970
WHO DOES THAT?

42:19.004 --> 42:22.140
I'M SORRY.
HIS STORY'S DONE.

42:24.142 --> 42:27.579
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
YOU CAN SAY TO CHANGE MY MIND.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.183
YOUR SON...

42:39.925 --> 42:43.061
WAS VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU AS HIS MOTHER.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.642
THAT WAS--
OH, SHUT UP.
