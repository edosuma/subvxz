00:00.834 --> 00:04.203
Hi. I'm the director of
"childrens hospital,"

00:04.205 --> 00:05.504
David wain.
Thank you.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.840
Tonight's episode is written
by the winner

00:07.842 --> 00:11.176
Of the "childrens hospital"
superfan contest, carol torton.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.345
I am the super-est fan
of all, david.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.015
I love "childrens hospital"
more than anything.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.816
Well, except my daughter,
of course.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.219
Now, is this your first
experience with writing?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.488
It's my first experience
writing for television, yes.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.723
But I've written a ton
of fan fiction.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.291
Okay, now,
for our audience,

00:26.293 --> 00:28.494
This is when fans of shows
and books and movies

00:28.496 --> 00:31.196
Write their own stories where
they make up their own ideas

00:31.198 --> 00:32.898
Of what the characters
should do.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.566
That is exactly right.
I've written a ton --

00:34.568 --> 00:36.535
"star trek,"
"buffy the vampire slayer,"

00:36.537 --> 00:38.170
"the daily show."

00:38.172 --> 00:40.239
Was it hard to write one
for "childrens hospital"?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.307
Well, I wanted
to explore two things.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.343
First of all, nurse beth!

00:44.345 --> 00:46.879
How is she not the star
of the show, you know?

00:46.881 --> 00:48.814
Okay. Okay.
Just so great. And then --

00:48.816 --> 00:50.149
So, you got to understand,

00:50.151 --> 00:51.550
We gave carol a few

00:51.552 --> 00:53.585
Basic tv 101
writing tips,

00:53.587 --> 00:55.821
Like, you know,
there should be high stakes,

00:55.823 --> 00:58.524
And there should be a ticking
clock, that sort of thing.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.993
But, no, she wrote the script
entirely by herself,

01:00.995 --> 01:03.262
And we shot it
exactly as she wrote it.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.999
So, we hope you enjoy tonight's
fan-fiction episode --

01:07.001 --> 01:09.535
"the lovers, the fighters,
the heroes,"

01:09.537 --> 01:13.072
Or, "who cures the doctor
but the moon and blood?"

01:13.074 --> 01:14.506
By carol torton.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.175
[ squeals ]
would you like to...

01:16.177 --> 01:20.245
Oh, my gosh, yes!
Aaaaah!

01:20.247 --> 01:22.581
[ mid-tempo music plays ]

01:24.884 --> 01:28.020
[ woman laughs ]

01:28.022 --> 01:31.356
<i>Hello, journal.</i>
<i>It's me, nurse beth.</i>

01:31.358 --> 01:33.358
<i>I've always felt like</i>
<i>the odd one out,</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:35.060
<i>Like a flower in the garden</i>

01:35.062 --> 01:37.863
<i>Whose strange leaves hide</i>
<i>the beautiful stamen</i>

01:37.865 --> 01:39.298
<i>And pistil within.</i>

01:39.300 --> 01:41.533
<i>I'm not one of the gang,</i>
<i>and it hurts.</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:44.203
<i>I am in love</i>
<i>with dr. Owen maestro.</i>

01:44.205 --> 01:46.939
<i>He is as gorgeous</i>
<i>as the languorous summer</i>

01:46.941 --> 01:49.241
<i>If the fall never arrived</i>
<i>to wipe the poppies</i>

01:49.243 --> 01:51.143
<i>And indian paintbrush</i>
<i>into oblivion,</i>

01:51.145 --> 01:53.579
<i>But he will never notice me.</i>

01:53.581 --> 01:55.914
<i>Instead, I'm having a sexual</i>
<i>affair with dr. Glenn richie.</i>

01:55.916 --> 01:58.317
<i>But he's just using me</i>
<i>for the sex,</i>

01:58.319 --> 02:00.619
<i>Like the handyman</i>
<i>uses a hammer.</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:05.290
<i>But alas, my dear journal,</i>
<i>he doesn't love me.</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:08.494
[ laughter ]

02:08.496 --> 02:11.730
<i>I am so attracted to owen,</i>
<i>I could barely continue on.</i>

02:11.732 --> 02:15.234
<i>My hand slowly moved</i>
<i>to my mons venus.</i>

02:15.236 --> 02:18.070
Dr. Owen maestro,
=you're so lame!

02:18.072 --> 02:20.906
You're indoors and you're
putting sunscreen on?

02:20.908 --> 02:22.241
You're so pale!

02:22.243 --> 02:24.610
You're as pale
as a bowl of cream!

02:24.612 --> 02:27.012
You're as pale
as the keys of a piano --

02:27.014 --> 02:29.081
The white ones!
Yeah!

02:29.083 --> 02:31.450
You're as pale as
the yummy blondies I bake

02:31.452 --> 02:33.986
With white chocolate chips.
[ laughs ]

02:33.988 --> 02:36.321
[ laughs ] sounds delish.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.789
You should have won
first place

02:37.791 --> 02:39.458
At the weymouth
community center bake-off,

02:39.460 --> 02:43.162
Not sandy homewood and her
tasteless red velvet cake.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.297
He is really pale!

02:45.299 --> 02:46.765
[ laughter ]

02:46.767 --> 02:48.367
<i>My desire to belong</i>

02:48.369 --> 02:49.968
<i>Overpowered my intense</i>
<i>attraction to owen.</i>

02:49.970 --> 02:51.970
<i>I realized I was going</i>
<i>to have to join in</i>

02:51.972 --> 02:53.105
<i>And make fun of him.</i>

02:53.107 --> 02:54.506
<i>Something along the lines of,</i>

02:54.508 --> 02:56.542
<i>"you're so pale,</i>
<i>you look like the moon."</i>

02:56.544 --> 02:59.478
Ha-ha! You're so pale,
you look like the moon.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.348
Shut your mouth, outsider.
You don't belong here.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.318
Why don't you go somewhere where
you do belong, outsider?

03:06.320 --> 03:09.488
Like <i> outside.</i>
[ laughs ]

03:09.490 --> 03:10.789
Why don't you go outside?
[ laughs ]

03:10.791 --> 03:13.559
Meet me
in my office later.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.794
We'll have sex like we always
do, rough and stinging.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.995
I'll dominate you,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.497
And I'll leave
your bottom crimson.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.799
You're only using me
for the physical stuff.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.334
I feel like
I'm being used.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.970
Like my daughter always says,
"hells yeah."

03:24.972 --> 03:27.339
Meet me in my office
so I can use you soon.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.007
Sure, I'll do that.
Bye-bye.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.709
Bye-bye.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.649
Fine. This whole sunscreen
business you read about

03:37.651 --> 03:39.651
Is just a bunch
of malarkey anyway.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.254
I mean, my daughter went
to swim camp all summer.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.523
She never used it once
and she survived.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.091
I'll go shower this stuff off.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.659
Hang on, sweetheart.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.528
You're in dr. Cat black's
hands now.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.396
We're gonna help you.
How are we gonna help her?

03:51.398 --> 03:54.333
To be honest, I have no idea
how we can help her.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.401
Hello, chief.
Drs. Downs, black.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.502
Hello, dr. Flame.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.171
Hello.
Hello.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.906
Well, we have to figure out
what's wrong with her

04:00.908 --> 04:02.407
Before the head brain surgeon
gets here.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.909
We have to prove to him

04:03.911 --> 04:05.844
That we're the absolute best
in the business

04:05.846 --> 04:08.714
By being the absolute
best that we can be.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.783
The <i> head</i> brain surgeon.
How ironic.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.953
Get it? Head and brains
are brothers.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.555
[ chuckles ]
ah. [ laughs ]

04:16.557 --> 04:17.889
Nice joke, chief.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.725
Even hospitals need
lighter moments.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.392
You're not afraid
to go there.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.527
Just like ray romano.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.363
So, what do we know?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.565
This girl
has terrible diarrhea.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.100
That sounds like
gastroenteritis

04:28.102 --> 04:29.768
Caused by strains
of campylobacter.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.770
Or in layman's terms,
"the runs."

04:31.772 --> 04:34.139
I agree.
In layman's terms, "the runs."

04:34.141 --> 04:36.141
Oh, "head brain surgeon."

04:36.143 --> 04:39.211
I just got it.
You're not afraid to go there.

04:39.213 --> 04:42.214
Geez, as my daughter
would say, "l-o-l."

04:42.216 --> 04:45.384
Oh, val. You may very well
be very, very pretty,

04:45.386 --> 04:48.920
But upstairs, your brains are
as blond as your locks are, too.

<i>I am on my way</i>
<i>to glenn's office</i>

<i>Dear diary, all of my dreams</i>
<i>have come true,</i>

<i>Like in some kind of a dream.</i>

<i>Owen, like a statue</i>
<i>from the grecian isle,</i>

05:01.435 --> 05:03.568
<i>Is full-on nude right now.</i>

Hey,
what are <i> you</i> looking at?

05:11.077 --> 05:12.844
[ breathing heavily ]

05:12.846 --> 05:15.280
Hey, nurse beth,

05:15.282 --> 05:17.282
I saw you looking at me
in the shower.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.751
Your body...
It's sparkling.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.554
Yeah, I sparkle sometimes.
I should have told you.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.025
No!

05:27.027 --> 05:27.759
What?

05:27.761 --> 05:28.960
We mustn't.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.530
We mustn't.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.099
We mustn't!

05:36.769 --> 05:38.670
Darn, her electrolytes
are too low.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.839
Electrolytes normally consist
of sodium,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.507
Potassium, carbon dioxide,
and chloride --

05:42.509 --> 05:43.942
Citation needed.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.811
This is more than just
gastroenteritis

05:45.813 --> 05:47.612
Caused by strains
of campylobacter.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.348
In layman's terms,
"the runs."

do you hear that?

05:50.818 --> 05:52.384
[ ticking ]
[ gasps ]

05:52.386 --> 05:54.286
There is a bomb
in this girl's tushie!

05:54.288 --> 05:55.654
We have to get that out.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.289
Let's cut this bomb
out of her tushie.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.624
Scalpel, stat!

05:59.626 --> 06:01.660
Now all we have to do is
wait while cat works on
that little girl's butthole

06:01.662 --> 06:03.128
With a scalpel for a bit.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.665
No, no, no!
It's too risky.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.166
We should just try
getting her

06:08.168 --> 06:09.701
To pass the bomb naturally
with fiber.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.536
Not fiber again.
You're always the doctor

06:11.538 --> 06:13.472
Who tries to take the
naturalistic approach,

06:13.474 --> 06:15.073
And I'm always the doctor who
wants to play it by the books.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.675
We never agree.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.178
I've got it! We should call
detective chance briggs.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.179
Isn't she right, cat?

06:21.181 --> 06:22.347
Yes.
Chief's right.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.883
I don't trust
that owen maestro.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.818
I don't know.
I mean, he seems okay.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.920
<i>You</i> are being a naughty
little girl, aren't you?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.822
I'm going to have to
teach you a lesson.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.657
Then I'm going to press
my erection

06:32.659 --> 06:34.860
Up against your tight abdomen
while we kiss.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.662
And then I'm gonna
tug off your panties

06:37.664 --> 06:40.665
And put my engorged male sex
inside of you,

06:40.667 --> 06:43.368
But not before I let my fingers
turn you inside out...

06:43.370 --> 06:46.138
With pleasure.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.912
Did someone call a detective
who has a mustache?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.380
Detective chance briggs,

06:55.382 --> 06:57.916
You old former partner
of dr. Owen maestro.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.986
I'll use my skills to disable
this tushie bomb.

07:03.623 --> 07:07.125
These sure are high stakes.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.902
Oh, my dear gosh!
That bruise.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.805
It's okay. You're
the best doctor here, owen.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.573
Do you treat
all the children here

07:21.575 --> 07:23.809
With such a tender touch as
you're giving me right now?

07:23.811 --> 07:26.578
Yes, but not in a gross
or illegal way.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.980
Children are our greatest gift
from god above,

07:28.982 --> 07:30.882
Though they can really
get my goat

07:30.884 --> 07:32.717
When they
don't listen sometimes.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.286
Make that <i> most</i> times.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.922
[ laughs ] you really did
go there, didn't you?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.290
I'm worried about you,
nurse beth.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.658
That bruise
looks like the work

07:39.660 --> 07:41.293
Of a one dr. Glenn richie.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.727
Where is that
little s.O.B.?

07:42.729 --> 07:44.296
No!

07:44.298 --> 07:46.331
It's not like
I can get another man.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.900
I'm the odd one out here
at childrens hospital.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.002
I may have the body
and stretch marks of a woman

07:51.004 --> 07:52.904
Who's given her
less-than-grateful husband

07:52.906 --> 07:54.306
A beautiful tween daughter

07:54.308 --> 07:55.841
Who can play the violin
up to level two,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.743
But I can juggle parenting
with both my writing

07:58.745 --> 08:01.279
And running a 700-hits-a-day
etsy store.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.081
I could be your man,
except...

08:03.083 --> 08:04.583
Except what?
Except I'm a --

08:04.585 --> 08:05.684
Hey!
What?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.185
Get your hands
off my bad girl!

08:07.187 --> 08:08.753
I was eavesdropping,
and I overheard

08:08.755 --> 08:10.789
When you didn't know
that I was listening but I was.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.658
I can tell you
what he is, beth.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.827
Nothing but a vampire.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.463
Well,
<i>you</i> should talk, glenn.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.432
Because glenn's
a werewolf!

08:20.434 --> 08:23.068
A vampire?
A werewolf?

08:24.470 --> 08:26.271
It's true.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.807
I can transform my body
into that of a wolf,

08:28.809 --> 08:30.141
But he's a bloodsucker,

08:30.143 --> 08:31.776
Hunting like
an undead shark

08:31.778 --> 08:34.546
Who flies like a bat
instead of swims like a shark.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.181
His hunger?

08:36.183 --> 08:40.552
Same as the shark I mentioned
before -- blood.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.388
I'm gonna tear you apart!

08:43.390 --> 08:45.457
