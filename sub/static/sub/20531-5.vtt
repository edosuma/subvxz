00:01.540 --> 00:04.000
RAMY ROMANY:
And here he is‐‐

00:04.000 --> 00:07.170
King Tut himself,

00:07.170 --> 00:12.130
laying right in front of us,
more than 3,000 years later.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.930
This tomb was made
for ultimate protection.

00:15.930 --> 00:18.010
And when they first
opened this tomb,

00:18.010 --> 00:20.640
people died mysteriously.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.440
ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
The ancient pharaohs

00:25.440 --> 00:27.230
would place a curse

00:27.230 --> 00:30.900
on all those who would
enter into their tombs.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.160
NARRATOR:
What is the deadly secret

00:35.160 --> 00:37.620
behind the curse of King Tut?

00:37.620 --> 00:40.790
WILLIAM HENRY: We're dealing
with an extraterrestrial force

00:40.790 --> 00:42.250
that the ancient Egyptians
were utilizing

00:42.250 --> 00:43.540
to protect these tombs.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.420
NARRATOR:
Does alien technology

00:45.420 --> 00:49.130
prevent us from learning
our true past?

00:49.130 --> 00:51.000
Something very significant
that perhaps we still

00:51.000 --> 00:54.010
don't understand
was hidden in that tomb.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.930
NARRATOR:
And if so, what might happen

00:56.930 --> 00:59.680
when the so‐called curse
is finally lifted?

00:59.680 --> 01:02.470
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: According
to the idea that I subscribe to,

01:02.470 --> 01:05.560
it will be the return
of the extraterrestrials.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.480
♪ ♪

01:37.380 --> 01:38.720
NARRATOR:
Oak Island.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.470
Nova Scotia, Canada.

01:40.470 --> 01:42.720
2017.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.770
Rick and Marty Lagina

01:45.770 --> 01:49.600
return to the land they
purchased here ten years ago

01:49.600 --> 01:53.030
in an effort to solve
a centuries‐old mystery‐‐

01:53.030 --> 01:57.030
one that began in 1795,

01:57.030 --> 02:00.910
when three Nova Scotia farm boys
set out to explore the island

02:00.910 --> 02:03.830
after witnessing strange lights

02:03.830 --> 02:06.080
coming from its shore
in the middle of the night.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.290
According to a legendary curse,

02:10.290 --> 02:14.710
seven men must die before the
island will reveal a treasure

02:14.710 --> 02:18.300
that lies buried
deep beneath its surface.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.850
So far, six lives have been lost
in pursuit of the treasure.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.850
The island has been studied
and explored

02:27.850 --> 02:31.940
by generation after generation
of earnest seekers.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.110
The current owners
have brought in

02:35.110 --> 02:37.780
much heavier equipment
than has ever been used before,

02:37.780 --> 02:39.530
and they are dedicated
to finding out

02:39.530 --> 02:41.070
the secret of Oak Island.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.120
NARRATOR: But some ancient
astronaut theorists believe

02:46.120 --> 02:49.830
they already know
what will be found.

02:49.830 --> 02:52.960
There was a giant shaft

02:52.960 --> 02:55.630
that had been dug
into the island.

02:55.630 --> 02:57.340
Very, very deep.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.260
And, at certain levels,

02:59.260 --> 03:02.430
flood tunnels had been built
from the ocean

03:02.430 --> 03:03.930
that came to the shaft.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.600
And so you have to wonder

03:05.600 --> 03:07.850
if people have gone through
a lot of effort

03:07.850 --> 03:09.640
to protect something.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.190
And I would suspect
the Ark of the Covenant.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.730
NARRATOR:
The Ark of the Covenant?

03:15.730 --> 03:19.650
The golden chest built to house
the Ten Commandments?

03:19.650 --> 03:22.700
How would this have ended up
buried more than

03:22.700 --> 03:26.370
100 feet beneath the earth
on Oak Island?

03:26.370 --> 03:29.500
And what does it
have to do with a curse?

03:31.370 --> 03:34.880
Ancient astronaut theorists
say the answer lies

03:34.880 --> 03:37.500
more than 5,000 miles away,

03:37.500 --> 03:42.930
with a curse that dates back
to the 14th century BC.

03:48.220 --> 03:51.480
Egypt. Valley of the Kings.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.730
November 4, 1922.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.270
A young boy,

03:57.270 --> 03:59.780
working for a British
excavation team

03:59.780 --> 04:01.530
led by Howard Carter,

04:01.530 --> 04:04.160
is riding his donkey
home one night,

04:04.160 --> 04:06.950
when suddenly the animal's hoof

04:06.950 --> 04:09.870
slips into a hole
below the sand.

04:09.870 --> 04:13.370
Thinking he may have stumbled
upon the entrance to a tomb,

04:13.370 --> 04:16.130
he rushes home
and alerts Carter.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.550
ROMANY:
When Howard Carter came in,

04:22.550 --> 04:25.760
they dug feverishly,
all the way through the tomb.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.350
72 steps.

04:28.350 --> 04:32.140
Till they reached
the sealed door of the tomb,

04:32.140 --> 04:35.190
which was right here.

04:35.190 --> 04:39.070
He instantly made a hole into
the wall before destroying it.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.610
And Howard Carter
peeked in and said‐‐

04:41.610 --> 04:43.450
and I quote‐‐

04:43.450 --> 04:46.990
"I see wonderful things."

04:46.990 --> 04:49.030
Which was very true.

04:49.030 --> 04:53.870
Right inside King Tut's tomb,
there were wonderful things.

04:53.870 --> 04:57.420
This tomb was packed
with gold and treasures.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.550
NARRATOR: Incredibly,
Howard Carter and his team

05:02.550 --> 05:06.260
had unearthed
the tomb of King Tutankhamen.

05:06.260 --> 05:10.010
To this day, it is considered
the best‐preserved

05:10.010 --> 05:14.810
and most intact tomb ever found
in the Valley of the Kings.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.860
Although the excavation team

05:20.860 --> 05:24.400
achieved instant, worldwide fame
for their discovery,

05:24.400 --> 05:28.660
their triumph was short‐lived.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.410
During the opening
of the tomb of King Tut,

05:32.410 --> 05:35.960
all the workers were very wary‐‐

05:35.960 --> 05:37.670
the Egyptian ones.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.920
It is known
that ancient Egyptian tombs

05:40.920 --> 05:44.920
have the curse of the pharaohs.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.050
Whoever enters the tomb first
will die.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.520
NARRATOR:
While most Westerners involved

05:53.520 --> 05:57.190
did not take the ancient stories
of a curse seriously,

05:57.190 --> 06:01.730
the opening of King Tut's tomb
was almost immediately followed

06:01.730 --> 06:05.320
by numerous tragedies,
some with eerie connections

06:05.320 --> 06:07.150
to the alleged curse.

06:09.820 --> 06:12.740
Soon after the opening
of the tomb,

06:12.740 --> 06:15.000
a messenger went to
the archaeologist's house.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.620
This was Howard Carter.

06:18.580 --> 06:23.550
He found Carter's beloved canary
in the mouth of a cobra,

06:23.550 --> 06:28.970
which was the symbolic
snake of the pharaoh.

06:28.970 --> 06:31.510
Later, we learned
that Lord Carnarvon himself

06:31.510 --> 06:34.100
was bit on the cheek
by a mosquito

06:34.100 --> 06:36.470
in the very same place
that King Tut, it turned out,

06:36.470 --> 06:38.180
was also wounded.

06:38.180 --> 06:42.110
He died within weeks
of a blood‐borne disease,

06:42.110 --> 06:44.270
very mysteriously.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.900
Howard Fields,
another archeologist

06:46.900 --> 06:50.860
who came to the tomb, had his
home burned down and flooded.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.530
And people began
to wonder if, in fact,

06:52.530 --> 06:54.740
this was the curse
of Tutankhamen.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.540
NARRATOR:
No fewer than seven deaths

06:59.540 --> 07:03.000
have been associated
with the opening of the tomb,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.250
the same number of lives
that Oak Island must claim,

07:06.250 --> 07:08.800
according to the legend.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.760
Could there really
have been a curse

07:10.760 --> 07:13.140
protecting King Tut's tomb?

07:13.140 --> 07:16.390
And if so, what was behind it?

07:18.640 --> 07:22.100
Curses were a tool of Heka,

07:22.100 --> 07:26.650
the magical technology
that the ancient Egyptians used

07:26.650 --> 07:31.400
that they said was a gift
of their extraterrestrial gods.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.370
This suggests that
the curse of the pharaohs

07:33.370 --> 07:36.030
is an extraterrestrial force,

07:36.030 --> 07:39.040
or perhaps even technology
that the ancient Egyptians

07:39.040 --> 07:41.160
were utilizing
to protect these tombs.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.210
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that some type

07:46.210 --> 07:49.510
of extraterrestrial technology
was activated

07:49.510 --> 07:52.510
with the opening
of King Tut's tomb?

07:52.510 --> 07:56.350
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

07:56.350 --> 08:00.390
and as further evidence, point
to the so‐called magic bricks

08:00.390 --> 08:03.060
found at the tomb.

08:03.060 --> 08:06.230
In the tomb of Tutankhamen...

08:29.090 --> 08:33.010
When we go over
to the Tibetan arena,

08:33.010 --> 08:34.430
we see these prayer wheels.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.140
And this is
a very interesting thing,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.600
because the priest
would actually go by

08:38.600 --> 08:40.560
and they would roll
these cylindrical drums

08:40.560 --> 08:42.770
with their hands.

08:42.770 --> 08:46.060
And they believe that
the simple rolling of the drum

08:46.060 --> 08:49.980
would actually impress the words
upon the space around them.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.820
They believe that space
was alive and intelligent.

08:52.820 --> 08:55.070
So this suggests the possibility

08:55.070 --> 08:57.620
that certain words do,
in a sense,

08:57.620 --> 09:00.740
become imbued with a force.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.250
That force may be something that

09:02.250 --> 09:03.960
certain types of
extraterrestrial

09:03.960 --> 09:08.290
or extra‐dimensional beings
can actually access.

09:08.290 --> 09:10.920
Is it possible
that the Egyptians

09:10.920 --> 09:13.470
were working with
extraterrestrials,

09:13.470 --> 09:16.260
who would, in fact, generate

09:16.260 --> 09:20.810
these types of
seemingly magical phenomena

09:20.810 --> 09:23.100
in the event that people
tried to transgress

09:23.100 --> 09:24.930
into these locations?

09:27.810 --> 09:30.400
NARRATOR:
If the so‐called magic bricks

09:30.400 --> 09:33.110
really were alien technology,

09:33.110 --> 09:36.070
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

09:36.070 --> 09:38.070
might they have triggered
the terrible events

09:38.070 --> 09:40.120
that were set in motion

09:40.120 --> 09:43.830
when Howard Carter breached
the entrance to King Tut's tomb?

09:43.830 --> 09:47.250
And is there a connection
to the curse

09:47.250 --> 09:50.960
that is said to exist
on Oak Island today?

09:50.960 --> 09:54.510
Perhaps further clues
will be revealed

09:54.510 --> 09:57.430
by examining an artifact
in King Tut's tomb

09:57.430 --> 10:00.430
that isn't found in any other:

10:00.430 --> 10:02.930
a fifth magic brick.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.520
NARRATOR:
September 22, 1926.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.150
Howard Carter and his team begin
their fifth excavation season

10:16.150 --> 10:19.950
at the tomb of King Tutankhamen.

10:19.950 --> 10:23.280
The focus of their work
is an unwalled room

10:23.280 --> 10:27.330
on the far end of the burial
chamber called the treasury.

10:27.330 --> 10:31.170
When they enter,
the first thing they come upon

10:31.170 --> 10:34.590
is a fifth so‐called
magic brick.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.880
HENRY: This fifth brick has
a harrowing inscription

10:37.880 --> 10:40.800
that reads,
"It is I who hindered the sand

10:40.800 --> 10:43.140
"from choking the secret chamber

10:43.140 --> 10:45.810
"and who repel
that one who would repel him

10:45.810 --> 10:47.520
"with the desert flame.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.600
"I have set aflame the desert.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.560
"I have caused the path
to be mistaken.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.230
I am for the protection
of the deceased."

10:56.230 --> 10:59.450
And we have to wonder,
why was this fifth brick

10:59.450 --> 11:01.410
placed in the tomb
of Tutankhamen?

11:03.370 --> 11:05.450
NARRATOR: While other
pharaohs' tombs were found

11:05.450 --> 11:08.200
to contain
four magic curse bricks,

11:08.200 --> 11:11.580
only King Tut's includes
a fifth.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.630
But why?

11:13.630 --> 11:16.420
That fifth brick may be a clue,

11:16.420 --> 11:20.470
a sort of "X"‐marks‐the‐spot
treasure map

11:20.470 --> 11:23.260
that shows us
that something very significant

11:23.260 --> 11:25.010
that perhaps
we still don't understand

11:25.010 --> 11:27.220
was hidden in that tomb.

11:29.100 --> 11:32.850
NARRATOR:
On September 28, 2015,

11:32.850 --> 11:35.730
British Egyptologist
Nicholas Reeves

11:35.730 --> 11:37.980
made a remarkable discovery

11:37.980 --> 11:42.320
while examining high‐resolution
scans of King Tut's tomb:

11:42.320 --> 11:44.820
the possibility
of hidden cavities

11:44.820 --> 11:47.950
within the burial chamber.

11:47.950 --> 11:51.160
Dr. Reeves looked
at high‐resolution images

11:51.160 --> 11:55.210
of this wall,
and, um, he noticed

11:55.210 --> 11:59.880
a crack that looks like
it should have been a door.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.840
And it was right about here.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.430
They brought thermal scanners in
and scanned behind this wall,

12:05.430 --> 12:08.220
and they believed
they found cavities

12:08.220 --> 12:11.640
behind this specific area.

12:11.640 --> 12:15.940
He took a permission to go
inside the north room

12:15.940 --> 12:20.070
and dig through to discover
what's behind this wall.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.200
But just a couple of months
before the mission took place,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.660
it was stopped
for unknown reasons.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.620
NARRATOR:
Who, or what, may be hidden

12:29.620 --> 12:33.410
in this secret chamber
is hotly debated,

12:33.410 --> 12:35.790
but some researchers believe
it is possible

12:35.790 --> 12:38.590
that it contains
the remains of Egypt's

12:38.590 --> 12:41.800
most controversial pharaoh,
Akhenaten,

12:41.800 --> 12:46.970
who also happens to be
the father of King Tut.

12:46.970 --> 12:51.270
Ancient Egypt had always been
polytheistic, many gods,

12:51.270 --> 12:55.560
and then there is a new leader,
a new pharaoh with a new idea.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.940
Akhenaten announces
there will be one god,

12:58.940 --> 13:01.900
they will be
a monotheistic people.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.280
Aten, the sun god,

13:04.280 --> 13:08.200
would be the one divinity
they all worshipped.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.450
The image is the sun disc.

13:11.450 --> 13:15.370
It shook the empire
in really terrible ways.

13:17.710 --> 13:20.630
NARRATOR: What could have
inspired Akhenaten to make

13:20.630 --> 13:25.010
such drastic changes during
a time of tremendous prosperity?

13:25.010 --> 13:28.680
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest there may have been

13:28.680 --> 13:33.180
an otherworldly influence,
and as evidence,

13:33.180 --> 13:36.600
point to the way he was depicted
by artists of the time.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.610
Akhenaten introduced
the idea that

13:40.610 --> 13:43.860
every time his artisans
would carve something,

13:43.860 --> 13:47.160
it had to be lifelike,
so it had to be represented

13:47.160 --> 13:49.240
exactly the way it was seen.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.660
Which is interesting, because,
if you look at the likenesses

13:52.660 --> 13:56.120
of Akhenaten,
he looks very strange.

13:56.120 --> 14:01.170
Akhenaten had himself depicted
in the most peculiar way.

14:01.170 --> 14:06.260
He had this elongated face,
he had this protruding belly,

14:06.260 --> 14:10.640
he had these almost like
chicken leg‐type legs.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.560
Very peculiar, with this
elongated skull at the back.

14:16.390 --> 14:18.690
Now, all other pharaohs

14:18.690 --> 14:22.730
had themselves depicted looking
as, shall we say,

14:22.730 --> 14:25.990
majestic and muscular
as possible.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.780
TSOUKALOS: One has to wonder
if Akhenaten may have been

14:29.780 --> 14:32.120
some type of
an extraterrestrial hybrid,

14:32.120 --> 14:37.580
and that is why he introduced
this one‐god rule.

14:37.580 --> 14:42.590
Perhaps that sun disc Aten
that Akhenaten prayed to

14:42.590 --> 14:46.760
wasn't a sun in the sky at all,
but it could have been

14:46.760 --> 14:50.430
an extraterrestrial
that instructed Akhenaten.

14:50.430 --> 14:54.890
The texts say
it's a winged disc.

14:54.890 --> 14:58.100
The sun is not referred to
as a winged disc.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.310
NARRATOR:
Following Akhenaten's death,

15:03.310 --> 15:05.400
his enemies went
to extreme lengths

15:05.400 --> 15:07.440
to obliterate his legacy.

15:09.650 --> 15:12.490
Right here,
opposite King Tut's tomb,

15:12.490 --> 15:15.580
is the very mysterious KV55.

15:15.580 --> 15:20.330
Most Egyptologists agree
that the mummy they found inside

15:20.330 --> 15:22.580
was King Akhenaten's mummy.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.670
They found a destroyed coffin,

15:27.670 --> 15:31.050
and every wall painting
was already chiseled off,

15:31.050 --> 15:34.220
intentionally chiseled off.

15:34.220 --> 15:35.890
Which would make sense.

15:35.890 --> 15:40.390
It would make sense that this
tomb has been trying to wipe out

15:40.390 --> 15:43.100
King Akhenaten's memory.

15:43.100 --> 15:47.730
NARRATOR: Because the tomb
had been so badly vandalized,

15:47.730 --> 15:50.650
it could not be verified
with absolute certainty

15:50.650 --> 15:53.160
who it belonged to.

15:53.160 --> 15:57.580
And some Egyptologists claim
that examination of the mummy

15:57.580 --> 16:01.250
proves definitively
that it was not Akhenaten‐‐

16:01.250 --> 16:03.290
it was someone else.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.090
AHMED OSMAN: When it was
examined, it turned out to be

16:08.090 --> 16:11.720
somebody who, uh,
is in his early 20s...

16:31.940 --> 16:34.450
HENRY: The ancient Egyptians
did not want us

16:34.450 --> 16:37.240
to know anything
about Akhenaten.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.370
You can only wonder
if there's a connection now

16:40.370 --> 16:44.000
to the curse that protects
King Tut's tomb.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.500
Was it, in fact, to protect
an even darker secret?

16:47.500 --> 16:51.050
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the mummy of Akhenaten

16:51.050 --> 16:55.720
was not buried in his tomb,
but instead was secretly placed

16:55.720 --> 17:00.720
in a hidden chamber in the tomb
of his son, King Tut?

17:00.720 --> 17:04.190
And might the so‐called
curse of the pharaohs

17:04.190 --> 17:07.690
have been put in place
to keep us from finding it

17:07.690 --> 17:11.650
until a time when we are ready
to discover the truth

17:11.650 --> 17:15.660
about Akhenaten's
otherworldly origins?

17:15.660 --> 17:19.240
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

17:19.240 --> 17:23.200
and suggest an even more
profound secret can be found

17:23.200 --> 17:26.040
by examining
King Tut's sarcophagus

17:26.040 --> 17:29.130
and the name that was
removed from it.

17:34.340 --> 17:37.220
NARRATOR:
Egypt. Valley of the Queens.

17:37.220 --> 17:41.810
January 26, 1909.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.980
13 years before the discovery
of King Tut's tomb,

17:45.980 --> 17:49.150
artist and playwright
Joseph Lindon Smith

17:49.150 --> 17:53.570
and Egyptologist Arthur Weigall
perform a theater piece

17:53.570 --> 17:55.320
for Howard Carter's team.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.530
The play tells the story
of a curse that was placed

17:59.530 --> 18:02.910
on the pharaoh Akhenaten
by the priests of Amun,

18:02.910 --> 18:05.080
who he had defied.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.540
According to the curse,
Akhenaten would not be able

18:08.540 --> 18:12.090
to travel to the otherworld,
but would be doomed

18:12.090 --> 18:15.970
to walk the Earth as a ghost.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.510
Now, some very interesting
circumstances unfortunately

18:18.510 --> 18:22.430
took place when they went
through with this play.

18:24.350 --> 18:27.140
This storm comes up
out of nowhere,

18:27.140 --> 18:29.400
blinds one of the actresses.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.820
One of the play writers' wives
is befuddled

18:33.820 --> 18:36.190
with this unknown sickness.

18:36.190 --> 18:38.740
Really raises a lot of questions

18:38.740 --> 18:42.330
as to this curse around
Akhenaten actually being real.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.870
In the legends of many curses,

18:47.870 --> 18:51.790
there is often a story
that a certain mantra,

18:51.790 --> 18:54.300
or reading a certain script

18:54.300 --> 18:58.300
will suddenly activate
the curse.

18:58.300 --> 19:02.720
So you have to wonder,
is it possible that there is

19:02.720 --> 19:06.020
some kind of
extraterrestrial device

19:06.020 --> 19:09.600
that's activated by sound?

19:09.600 --> 19:14.360
Just in the same way
that we would talk to Siri

19:14.360 --> 19:18.280
or Alexa, from Amazon,

19:18.280 --> 19:22.070
and activate it with our voices,
and give it commands,

19:22.070 --> 19:24.410
and then it's going to
do something for us.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.460
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that there is some form of

19:30.460 --> 19:33.380
alien technology
that was enacted with both

19:33.380 --> 19:35.750
the unsealing of King Tut's tomb

19:35.750 --> 19:38.800
and the recitation
of ancient lines

19:38.800 --> 19:42.680
contained in the play
to lift Akhenaten's curse?

19:42.680 --> 19:48.470
Ancient astronaut theorists say
yes, and suggest that the curse

19:48.470 --> 19:51.480
was designed not only
to hide the truth about

19:51.480 --> 19:54.730
Akhenaten's
extraterrestrial ancestry,

19:54.730 --> 20:00.150
but also another incredible
secret about mankind's past‐‐

20:00.150 --> 20:02.450
one that can be found
by examining

20:02.450 --> 20:04.490
the sarcophagus of King Tut.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.330
ROMANY:
Every mummy had coffins that

20:11.330 --> 20:13.460
look like the king.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.330
The face was sculpted
in a way that looks like

20:15.330 --> 20:17.340
the mummy inside it.

20:17.340 --> 20:20.800
Whether the coffins were made
of wood or made of solid gold,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.260
like King Tut's,

20:22.260 --> 20:24.840
it had to resemble
the way King Tut looked.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.640
NARRATOR: Every pharaoh was
buried not within one coffin,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.350
but several concentric coffins,

20:33.350 --> 20:36.230
like a Russian nesting doll.

20:36.230 --> 20:38.270
King Tut has three.

20:41.690 --> 20:45.320
Right in front of me is
the sarcophagus of the king.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.990
Now there's a lot of debate
about the middle coffin.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.410
It has different facial features
than the rest.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.370
And it also seems like

20:54.370 --> 20:58.290
the cartouche where
the name of the king would be

20:58.290 --> 21:02.800
was replaced with
King Tut's name instead.

21:02.800 --> 21:06.680
Now, under further analysis,
they were able to read

21:06.680 --> 21:10.600
the name on the cartouche
underneath King Tut's name.

21:10.600 --> 21:15.640
And that read "Ankhkheperure."

21:15.640 --> 21:18.980
Ankhkheperure was not King Tut.

21:18.980 --> 21:24.240
NARRATOR: Why was a sarcophagus
that was made for Ankhkheperure

21:24.240 --> 21:26.410
used to hold the mummy
of King Tut?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.240
ROMANY:
His death at 19

21:30.240 --> 21:33.000
was definitely a problem
for the tomb makers.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
It ended up being a rushed job.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.370
He got the smallest tomb
in the valley.

21:37.370 --> 21:40.750
NARRATOR:
But who is Ankhkheperure?

21:40.750 --> 21:44.550
Every ruler in ancient Egypt
was given a throne name

21:44.550 --> 21:47.300
that was different
from his birth name.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.100
The throne name of Ankhkheperure

21:50.100 --> 21:52.890
is believed to have belonged
to a very important

21:52.890 --> 21:55.770
and mysterious member
of King Tut's family.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.480
ROMANY: Ankhkheperure could
have been the throne name

22:02.480 --> 22:04.740
of Prince Thutmose,

22:04.740 --> 22:06.860
who was allegedly
Akhenaten's brother

22:06.860 --> 22:10.450
and was supposed to rule
before or after Akhenaten,

22:10.450 --> 22:12.030
but never got to.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.370
NARRATOR:
There are numerous theories

22:15.370 --> 22:19.120
regarding Akhenaten's
mysterious brother Thutmose.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.380
But the most profound comes
from an unexpected source:

22:23.380 --> 22:25.300
Sigmund Freud,

22:25.300 --> 22:28.970
who, in addition to being
the founder of psychoanalysis,

22:28.970 --> 22:33.680
was also a scholar of
Judaism and ancient Egypt.

22:33.680 --> 22:38.600
Sigmund Freud, the famous
psychoanalyst, in 1939,

22:38.600 --> 22:44.230
first suggested that monotheism
began with Akhenaten,

22:44.230 --> 22:47.610
and he thought that someone
in Akhenaten's court,

22:47.610 --> 22:50.610
perhaps his brother Thutmoses,

22:50.610 --> 22:54.200
could in fact be
the historical Moses.

22:56.540 --> 23:01.170
NARRATOR: Could Sigmund Freud's
audacious conclusion be true?

23:01.170 --> 23:03.750
That Akhenaten's
biological brother

23:03.750 --> 23:07.170
was in fact
the Hebrew leader Moses?

23:07.170 --> 23:09.680
According to Freud,

23:09.680 --> 23:13.180
the events depicted in the
Bible surrounding Moses' birth,

23:13.180 --> 23:17.680
exile, and most importantly
his introduction of monotheism,

23:17.680 --> 23:22.860
perfectly coincide with the
historical record of Thutmose.

23:22.860 --> 23:28.030
The name Thutmoses means
"son of the god Thoth."

23:28.030 --> 23:33.030
If you take away the "Thut"
element in his name,

23:33.030 --> 23:35.620
it simply means "son of."

23:35.620 --> 23:39.000
"Mose" means "the son of."

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Now, the name Moses
is very similar to "Mose,"

23:43.000 --> 23:47.500
and it just so happens that
the story of Moses in the Bible

23:47.500 --> 23:50.470
is set at exactly the time

23:50.470 --> 23:53.220
that Thutmose
disappears from history.

23:55.430 --> 23:57.310
And we're told in the Bible

23:57.310 --> 24:02.690
that Moses grows up
as the brother

24:02.690 --> 24:06.900
of the prince apparent
to the throne.

24:06.900 --> 24:10.150
In other words,
the historical Thutmose

24:10.150 --> 24:13.320
could be the biblical Moses.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.870
NARRATOR:
In recent years,

24:19.870 --> 24:22.920
a number of Egyptologists,
like Ahmed Osman,

24:22.920 --> 24:26.040
have proposed theories
similar to Freud's.

24:26.040 --> 24:29.130
OSMAN:
Freud realized the similarity

24:29.130 --> 24:33.680
between Akhenaten's religion
and the Jewish religion.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.720
He suggested that after
Akhenaten had left his throne...

24:58.450 --> 25:00.580
NARRATOR:
Curiously, at the same time

25:00.580 --> 25:03.460
as the Exodus of the Israelites,

25:03.460 --> 25:06.790
it is also recorded
that the followers of Akhenaten

25:06.790 --> 25:09.750
were forced to flee Egypt.

25:09.750 --> 25:12.720
Do the stories
of Moses and Akhenaten

25:12.720 --> 25:15.880
reveal
an extraterrestrial agenda

25:15.880 --> 25:18.430
to alter the course of humanity?

25:18.430 --> 25:22.600
Ancient astronaut
theorists propose that,

25:22.600 --> 25:25.440
much like Akhenaten,
many of the events

25:25.440 --> 25:27.440
surrounding the life of Moses

25:27.440 --> 25:29.860
point to an otherworldly
connection.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.990
NARRATOR:
The Egyptian Museum.

25:39.990 --> 25:42.490
Cairo, Egypt.

25:42.490 --> 25:46.370
On prominent display
in the King Tutankhamen exhibit

25:46.370 --> 25:50.420
is a wooden chest
covered in gold leaf.

25:50.420 --> 25:54.260
On top of it sits
the statue of a jackal,

25:54.260 --> 25:56.720
the Egyptian god Anubis.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.640
When Howard Carter and his team
began their fifth season

26:00.640 --> 26:05.230
excavating King Tut's tomb
in 1926, they came upon

26:05.230 --> 26:09.690
this unusual shrine guarding the
entrance to the treasury room.

26:09.690 --> 26:13.360
What ancient astronaut theorists
find most intriguing

26:13.360 --> 26:17.320
about this artifact is
its undeniable similarities

26:17.320 --> 26:20.160
with perhaps
the most important sacred object

26:20.160 --> 26:23.410
in all of Judeo‐Christian
history:

26:23.410 --> 26:26.620
the Ark of the Covenant.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.580
The Ark of the Covenant
is the central shrine

26:28.580 --> 26:30.290
to ancient Israel.

26:30.290 --> 26:33.170
It's actually a‐a box,
a wooden box

26:33.170 --> 26:37.340
made out of acacia wood,
overlaid in gold.

26:37.340 --> 26:41.300
And on the cover are two
mythological beings, cherubs.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.930
There are also rings
on the side of the box

26:43.930 --> 26:47.600
through which poles are placed.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.940
What we have
in Tutankhamen's tomb

26:49.940 --> 26:53.690
is an Egyptian version
of the Ark of the Covenant.

26:53.690 --> 26:58.570
If Prince Thutmoses
was the historical Moses

26:58.570 --> 27:02.620
it would explain why,
when he led the Israelites

27:02.620 --> 27:06.950
out of Egypt into
the Sinai wilderness,

27:06.950 --> 27:11.210
that he got them to make
this Ark of the Covenant.

27:11.210 --> 27:13.250
It is exactly the same
as the item found

27:13.250 --> 27:15.460
in Tutankhamen's tomb.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.220
NARRATOR: But what could account
for the similarity between

27:21.220 --> 27:25.470
the Anubis Shrine
and the Ark of the Covenant?

27:25.470 --> 27:28.020
According to the biblical text,

27:28.020 --> 27:31.940
Moses was given instructions for
building the Ark of the Covenant

27:31.940 --> 27:36.480
when he spoke with God
at the top of Mount Sinai.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.650
However, some ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

27:40.650 --> 27:44.780
there is evidence that the Ark
already existed in Egypt.

27:47.870 --> 27:50.120
There's numerous depictions
on the temple walls

27:50.120 --> 27:52.420
that reference a device
that resembles

27:52.420 --> 27:54.170
the Ark of the Covenant.

27:54.170 --> 27:58.710
At the Temple of Seti in
Abydos, in the Osiris Chapel,

27:58.710 --> 28:00.920
we see depicted on the walls

28:00.920 --> 28:04.970
the single most powerful relic
in all of human history.

28:04.970 --> 28:08.680
It's called the Osiris Device.

28:08.680 --> 28:12.060
It functioned
as a stairway to heaven.

28:12.060 --> 28:15.150
What most people don't realize
is that the Osiris Device

28:15.150 --> 28:17.520
was actually the biblical
Arc of the Covenant.

28:20.150 --> 28:22.610
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Anubis Shrine

28:22.610 --> 28:24.870
found in King Tut's tomb

28:24.870 --> 28:27.910
was a representation
of the Osiris Device,

28:27.910 --> 28:31.200
the Egyptian name for
what would become known

28:31.200 --> 28:33.330
as the Ark of the Covenant?

28:33.330 --> 28:37.000
Could it have originally
belonged to Akhenaten,

28:37.000 --> 28:41.300
and might Moses have taken this
with him when he left Egypt?

28:41.300 --> 28:44.590
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

28:44.590 --> 28:46.510
and suggest that this object

28:46.510 --> 28:48.890
contained
extraterrestrial technology.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.900
The Bible records
that when the Ark was,

28:54.900 --> 28:57.650
for lack of a better word,
activated,

28:57.650 --> 29:02.860
two sons of the High Priest
Aaron approached it.

29:02.860 --> 29:05.700
And because they were not
properly prepared,

29:05.700 --> 29:11.240
the Bible says a fire came forth
and burned them.

29:11.240 --> 29:16.040
But the legends state
that the nature of this fire

29:16.040 --> 29:20.880
was two beams of light
that actually entered

29:20.880 --> 29:24.680
inside their nostrils
and burned them from within.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.510
Sounds very similar
to what we today understand

29:27.510 --> 29:28.890
as electrocution.

29:31.890 --> 29:33.930
It was said that the Ark
could create lightning,

29:33.930 --> 29:35.890
that the Ark could fly.

29:35.890 --> 29:38.060
We know that
the Ark of the Covenant

29:38.060 --> 29:41.270
is a communication device
between man and God,

29:41.270 --> 29:44.240
because God tells us so
in Exodus.

29:46.240 --> 29:50.950
So was this god
some kind of extraterrestrial?

29:50.950 --> 29:53.790
And was the Ark of the Covenant
some sort of device

29:53.790 --> 29:56.290
that allowed communication

29:56.290 --> 30:01.130
between Moses and Aaron and
some extraterrestrial spaceship

30:01.130 --> 30:02.340
orbiting the Earth?

30:05.010 --> 30:07.380
NARRATOR:
But if extraterrestrials

30:07.380 --> 30:11.350
directed Moses, and perhaps
Akhenaten before him,

30:11.350 --> 30:15.270
to lead the Israelites towards
a new monotheistic faith,

30:15.270 --> 30:17.390
what motivated them to do so?

30:19.440 --> 30:21.610
What if these alien visitors
didn't want

30:21.610 --> 30:23.940
future generations
of humans to know

30:23.940 --> 30:27.110
that they had intervened
in our development?

30:27.110 --> 30:32.330
If a new monotheistic religion
were to arise,

30:32.330 --> 30:36.040
then people would start
to relegate figures like Amun‐Ra

30:36.040 --> 30:40.040
and the all the rest
to the realm of mythology.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.710
The extraterrestrials
could hide our true history

30:43.710 --> 30:47.550
until a time when we were
ready to have it revealed.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.680
NARRATOR:
Did alien visitors

30:52.680 --> 30:55.770
attempt to change
the course of history,

30:55.770 --> 30:59.520
first through Akhenaten
and then Moses?

30:59.520 --> 31:02.810
And might this be
why a so‐called curse

31:02.810 --> 31:04.900
was put on King Tut's tomb,

31:04.900 --> 31:08.110
to hide the clues
that lead to this connection,

31:08.110 --> 31:12.160
until humanity is ready
to know the truth?

31:12.160 --> 31:15.240
Perhaps further answers
can be found

31:15.240 --> 31:18.330
by examining the fate
of the Ark of the Covenant

31:18.330 --> 31:23.420
after the time of Moses,
and the curse that followed it.

31:35.220 --> 31:39.940
NARRATOR:
Jerusalem, 586 BC.

31:39.940 --> 31:44.560
Roughly 750 years
after the death of Akhenaten,

31:44.560 --> 31:49.190
and the Exodus of Moses
and the Israelites from Egypt,

31:49.190 --> 31:53.030
the Ark of the Covenant
is believed to reside here

31:53.030 --> 31:57.040
in Solomon's Temple,
where it is heavily guarded.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.870
But the city has been
under siege by the Babylonians,

32:00.870 --> 32:05.710
who finally manage to break
through Jerusalem's walls.

32:05.710 --> 32:10.170
In 586 BCE, the Babylonians came

32:10.170 --> 32:12.880
and ultimately destroyed
the Temple of Solomon.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.680
The million‐dollar question is:

32:14.680 --> 32:16.850
what happened
to the Ark of the Covenant?

32:16.850 --> 32:20.270
NARRATOR: According
to historical accounts,

32:20.270 --> 32:23.100
the Babylonians stole
every treasure they could find

32:23.100 --> 32:25.980
from Solomon's Temple,
but there is no mention

32:25.980 --> 32:28.610
of the Ark of the Covenant.

32:28.610 --> 32:33.950
One story proposes that King
Solomon had a son named Menelik

32:33.950 --> 32:35.990
with the Queen of Sheba,

32:35.990 --> 32:40.200
and that Menelik stole the Ark
and took it to Ethiopia with him

32:40.200 --> 32:43.790
long before
the Babylonians invaded,

32:43.790 --> 32:47.540
hiding it in a small chapel
in the city of Aksum,

32:47.540 --> 32:50.460
where it still resides today.

32:50.460 --> 32:52.630
But many believe

32:52.630 --> 32:56.430
the Ark remained hidden
at the site of Solomon's Temple

32:56.430 --> 32:58.560
long after
the Babylonian invasion,

32:58.560 --> 33:01.020
until it was smuggled
out of Jerusalem

33:01.020 --> 33:05.310
by the ancient order
of the Knights Templar.

33:05.310 --> 33:09.150
The Knights Templar
were a mysterious order

33:09.150 --> 33:12.650
of warrior monks who were formed
in the 12th century.

33:12.650 --> 33:16.820
King Baldwin II of Jerusalem
gave them a wing of a palace

33:16.820 --> 33:19.830
on what we now know
as the Temple Mount.

33:19.830 --> 33:23.540
A number of historians
have speculated

33:23.540 --> 33:26.710
that it was part of
their mandate to do excavations

33:26.710 --> 33:28.880
at Solomon's Temple
in Jerusalem,

33:28.880 --> 33:31.340
and that during
these excavations,

33:31.340 --> 33:34.800
they discovered, in a hidden
chamber, beneath the temple,

33:34.800 --> 33:37.340
a secret room that had
the Ark of the Covenant in it.

33:39.260 --> 33:41.510
NARRATOR:
Were the Knights Templar

33:41.510 --> 33:45.100
really in possession
of the Ark of the Covenant?

33:45.100 --> 33:48.270
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

33:48.270 --> 33:50.980
and suggest there is evidence

33:50.980 --> 33:56.200
that, like King Tut's tomb,
it too was protected by a curse.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.160
Ile de la Cité.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.660
Paris, France.

34:04.660 --> 34:07.790
March 18, 1314.

34:07.790 --> 34:13.000
After enduring seven long years
of torture, Jacques de Molay,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.920
the 23rd and final Grand Master
of the Knights Templar,

34:15.920 --> 34:19.510
is executed
by order of King Philip IV

34:19.510 --> 34:22.930
and Pope Clement V.

34:22.930 --> 34:26.270
It's thought that
King Philip really wanted

34:26.270 --> 34:28.140
to get rid of the Templars

34:28.140 --> 34:30.360
so that he could take
their treasure

34:30.360 --> 34:32.400
and pay off his own debts.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.940
But you have to wonder,

34:33.940 --> 34:36.530
did King Philip
and maybe the pope

34:36.530 --> 34:40.820
realize that the Templars
had the Ark of the Covenant now,

34:40.820 --> 34:43.790
and perhaps this is
what they really wanted,

34:43.790 --> 34:46.330
an extraterrestrial device

34:46.330 --> 34:49.170
that was being kept
by the Knights Templar?

34:49.170 --> 34:52.960
COPPENS: Jacques de Molay
gets the last word.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.840
He curses both
the pope, Clement V,

34:55.840 --> 34:58.340
and the king, Philip IV,

34:58.340 --> 35:02.260
directly from the stake
before he dies.

35:02.260 --> 35:05.060
But he doesn't stop there.

35:05.060 --> 35:08.180
Jacques de Molay does not
just curse the king.

35:08.180 --> 35:11.980
He curses the entire line
of the Capetian kings.

35:14.190 --> 35:17.940
Shortly after,
the pope died of a rare disease.

35:17.940 --> 35:22.780
The church where the service
was to be held for the pope

35:22.780 --> 35:24.700
burned down.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.160
The king died,

35:27.160 --> 35:32.080
the house that followed him
lost control of the throne.

35:32.080 --> 35:36.840
All this, shortly after
the Grand Master was executed.

35:36.840 --> 35:40.760
The curse seems
to have come literally true.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.510
Over the course
of the next 14 years,

35:43.510 --> 35:47.310
all three
of King Philip's sons died

35:47.310 --> 35:50.020
and his only grandson died
as well,

35:50.020 --> 35:52.310
ending the Capetian dynasty

35:52.310 --> 35:55.020
exactly as Jacques de Molay
had cursed.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.070
So you have to wonder

35:57.070 --> 36:00.740
if this curse
on King Philip and the pope

36:00.740 --> 36:03.450
was something that came through

36:03.450 --> 36:06.870
the Ark of the Covenant
in some strange way,

36:06.870 --> 36:10.960
and its curse was all about
protecting that device itself.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.670
(yelling)

36:13.670 --> 36:15.420
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

36:15.420 --> 36:17.880
that the curse placed
upon King Tut's tomb

36:17.880 --> 36:19.460
was also the same one

36:19.460 --> 36:22.300
that protected
the Ark of the Covenant?

36:22.300 --> 36:26.260
And could it be
that the curse has its origins

36:26.260 --> 36:29.020
in an extraterrestrial
intelligence?

36:31.350 --> 36:33.560
When the Knights Templar
were persecuted in France

36:33.560 --> 36:35.270
in the 14th century,

36:35.270 --> 36:38.400
Scotland became
their safe haven.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.860
Some researchers believe

36:40.860 --> 36:43.610
they brought the Ark
of the Covenant with them,

36:43.610 --> 36:46.830
before a Templar
named Henry Sinclair

36:46.830 --> 36:49.160
secretly smuggled it
to the New World,

36:49.160 --> 36:53.870
landing in Nova Scotia in 1398.

36:53.870 --> 36:57.500
Curiously,
a tribe called the Mi'kmaq,

36:57.500 --> 36:59.840
that occupied
this region of Canada

36:59.840 --> 37:01.800
during Sinclair's
alleged expedition,

37:01.800 --> 37:04.430
designed their flag in a manner

37:04.430 --> 37:07.180
that is a mirror image
of the Templar battle flag.

37:09.350 --> 37:12.180
Within this greater
Nova Scotia area,

37:12.180 --> 37:15.440
there are many signs
that the Templars were there.

37:15.440 --> 37:19.480
You have
the Newport, Rhode Island Tower

37:19.480 --> 37:23.030
that is thought to have been
built by the Knights Templar.

37:23.030 --> 37:27.530
You have images of knights
with swords and helmets

37:27.530 --> 37:31.540
that are carved on rocks in
New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

37:31.540 --> 37:36.330
And on Oak Island itself
is a giant cross,

37:36.330 --> 37:41.880
a thousand feet long, that's
made out of six huge boulders.

37:41.880 --> 37:46.930
And the central boulder
looks like a human head,

37:46.930 --> 37:51.430
and it has a sword
carved into the side.

37:51.430 --> 37:53.850
NARRATOR:
Did the Ark of the Covenant

37:53.850 --> 37:56.520
really end up
buried on Oak Island?

37:56.520 --> 37:59.520
Perhaps further clues
can be found

37:59.520 --> 38:02.650
by examining the curse
that continues

38:02.650 --> 38:04.900
to plague the island
to this day.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
NARRATOR
Oak Island.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.710
Nova Scotia, Canada.

38:17.710 --> 38:19.420
1803.

38:19.420 --> 38:23.000
Simeon Lynds forms
the Onslow Company,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.670
the first formal organization

38:25.670 --> 38:30.140
dedicated to excavating
the treasure at Oak Island.

38:30.140 --> 38:33.770
Within a year, while digging
in the infamous borehole

38:33.770 --> 38:36.060
known as the Money Pit,

38:36.060 --> 38:40.980
they discover an unusual stone
slab at a depth of 90 feet.

38:40.980 --> 38:43.110
When it is brought
to the surface,

38:43.110 --> 38:45.570
the excavators
immediately notice

38:45.570 --> 38:48.490
strange hieroglyphs
of an unknown language

38:48.490 --> 38:50.320
covering the stone.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.990
Shortly after this,

38:52.990 --> 38:56.160
a series of calamities
befall everyone who attempts

38:56.160 --> 38:59.710
to search for the treasure.

38:59.710 --> 39:03.460
There is famously
a curse around Oak Island,

39:03.460 --> 39:06.090
and it is said
that seven people must die

39:06.090 --> 39:10.180
before the treasure of
Oak Island will reveal itself.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.760
And there have in fact been
tragic deaths on Oak Island.

39:16.470 --> 39:20.440
NARRATOR: The island claimed
its first victim in 1861,

39:20.440 --> 39:24.940
when the boiler of a cast‐iron
pump and steam engine burst,

39:24.940 --> 39:28.530
scalding one man to death
and injuring others.

39:28.530 --> 39:32.740
In 1897,
Maynard Kaiser was killed

39:32.740 --> 39:35.160
when a hoisting rope
slipped off a pulley,

39:35.160 --> 39:37.540
dropping him down a shaft.

39:37.540 --> 39:43.840
And in 1965, Robert Restall
also fell into a shaft,

39:43.840 --> 39:48.510
after inhaling mysterious fumes
that rendered him unconscious.

39:48.510 --> 39:52.590
His son Bobby and two other men
who attempted a rescue

39:52.590 --> 39:57.390
died along with him,
bringing the death toll to six.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.480
Could this be evidence

40:02.480 --> 40:05.730
that a curse truly exists
on Oak Island?

40:05.730 --> 40:08.530
And might it be connected

40:08.530 --> 40:12.570
to the stone slab that contained
mysterious hieroglyphic writing?

40:14.820 --> 40:17.120
When you look at
the so‐called 90‐foot stone,

40:17.120 --> 40:20.160
you have to ask yourself:
is this the clue

40:20.160 --> 40:23.460
that gets you to understand what
the treasure of Oak Island is?

40:23.460 --> 40:26.340
Or might it be a curse brick

40:26.340 --> 40:29.550
that is actually trying
to protect that secret?

40:29.550 --> 40:31.930
There is
an undeniable similarity

40:31.930 --> 40:34.720
between this brick
that we see at Oak Island

40:34.720 --> 40:38.010
and the curse bricks
that we see in King Tut's tomb.

40:38.010 --> 40:41.430
TSOUKALOS:
The Templars chose Oak Island

40:41.430 --> 40:45.270
to bury whatever it is that they
found at the temple in Jerusalem

40:45.270 --> 40:47.400
during the Crusades.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.230
And in my opinion,
what they had discovered

40:49.230 --> 40:52.450
was either the complete
Ark of the Covenant

40:52.450 --> 40:54.820
or components of it.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.700
And the Ark of the Covenant,

40:56.700 --> 40:58.660
according to
the ancient astronaut theory,

40:58.660 --> 41:01.450
contained
an extraterrestrial device.

41:01.450 --> 41:05.080
WILCOCK: This suggests that
there could be one unified group

41:05.080 --> 41:08.750
that is behind Oak Island,
behind King Tut's tomb,

41:08.750 --> 41:11.460
that is protecting
the Ark of the Covenant,

41:11.460 --> 41:15.340
that is protecting
the Egyptian heritage of Moses,

41:15.340 --> 41:17.720
and may in fact
be concealing the truth

41:17.720 --> 41:20.350
of humanity's
extraterrestrial origins.

41:20.350 --> 41:23.810
NARRATOR:
Could an ancient Egyptian curse

41:23.810 --> 41:26.560
really be guarding
an incredible secret

41:26.560 --> 41:29.860
concerning mankind's
alien origins?

41:29.860 --> 41:32.820
And might proof of that secret

41:32.820 --> 41:36.820
be contained within the
legendary Ark of the Covenant?

41:36.820 --> 41:42.160
There are those who believe
the answer is a profound yes,

41:42.160 --> 41:46.420
and that the evidence
lies buried some 160 feet

41:46.420 --> 41:49.750
below a remote island
in Nova Scotia,

41:49.750 --> 41:52.880
and which, like King Tut's tomb,

41:52.880 --> 41:56.590
remains guarded
by a deadly curse,

41:56.590 --> 42:00.970
one that demands
the sacrifice of seven lives

42:00.970 --> 42:04.370
before the secret
can be revealed.
