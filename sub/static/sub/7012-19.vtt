00:08.660 --> 00:10.580
Jackie, you clocked out
half an hour ago.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.500
Did you come back
to tell me something?

00:12.580 --> 00:15.380
Because I feel
the same way.

00:15.460 --> 00:19.660
I was waiting outside for Michael to
pick me up, but the idiot never showed.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.060
That's the third time
this week.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.940
Three strikes and he's out,
according to the rules of baseball...

00:24.980 --> 00:26.860
and love.

00:28.660 --> 00:32.060
Actually, it's four strikes,
if you count the time he showed up late...

00:32.140 --> 00:35.340
'cause he had to see how
<i>The Jetsons</i> ended.

00:35.380 --> 00:39.020
Man, first he goes behind your back
and takes that modeling job...

00:39.100 --> 00:41.820
and now this whole
<i>Jetsons</i> thing?

00:41.900 --> 00:45.100
No futuristic cartoon
could ever keep me from you.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.540
I just don't know
what's happening to us.

00:47.580 --> 00:50.380
Okay. Jackie,
you need to cheer up.

00:50.420 --> 00:53.740
And the first step to cheering up
is giving Todd a hug.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:03.020 --> 01:05.900
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

01:05.980 --> 01:10.900
I am so glad
I went shopping today!

01:48.440 --> 01:50.360
- What do I do?
- Run like the wind!

01:51.960 --> 01:53.800
Eric!

01:54.880 --> 01:57.680
Did you get a haircut?
'Cause I love it.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.280
You look just like
Parker Stevenson.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.120
Really? 'Cause I told the guy
that he should... No, no, no!

02:03.200 --> 02:07.000
That's not gonna work,
tramp-face.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.919
I saw tongue.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.840
Okay, Eric, I know you and I don't
have the best relationship.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.880
- You mean, I hate you, and you hate me.
- Right.

02:17.960 --> 02:23.680
So, let's turn over a new leaf by you never
telling Michael what you <i>think</i> you just saw.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.960
Hmm.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.240
Or I could just torture you
with this information until I'm bored.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.280
- Eric!
- Okay, you know what? I'll make you a deal.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.760
You can buy two guaranteed hours
of silence...

02:38.840 --> 02:42.960
by carving this wheel of cheddar
into a handsome likeness of me.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.520
And... go.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.080
- Red, dinner's ready.
- Five more minutes, Kitty.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.400
A bunch of birds threw
a "crap on my Corvette" party.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.560
If I don't get it off,
the paint will oxidize. Oxidize!

03:01.200 --> 03:03.160
Why don't you just
put the car in the garage?

03:08.880 --> 03:14.600
Because if I put the car in the garage,
I can't see it from the dinner table!

03:14.680 --> 03:19.720
Kitty, don't give advice about
things you don't understand!

03:22.040 --> 03:25.400
Okay.
I'm the crazy one.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.400
Well, um, let's just
go ahead and eat.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.720
Oh, we're not
doing that yet?

03:36.800 --> 03:41.720
You know, ever since Red got his new car,
he can barely tear himself away from it.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.080
You better watch out, Kitty,
or you're gonna end up a Corvette widow.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.000
Oh, no, he loves that car.
He deserves it.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.480
The last treat he bought himself
was a pellet gun...

03:50.560 --> 03:54.360
to shoot the chipmunks
that were stealing our tomatoes.

03:54.440 --> 03:58.840
And I had to throw that away,
because it was giving him war nightmares.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.800
I'm glad
you threw it out.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.320
That thing hurt.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.480
Kitty, I know
what I'm talking about.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.440
As soon as my ex-husband got a boat,
it was like he forgot I even existed.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.360
So I divorced him,
took the boat...

04:11.440 --> 04:14.800
and spent a vigorous three-day weekend
on it with the harbormaster.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.680
I don't...
I don't think that's kitchen talk.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.960
Okay, okay.

04:30.040 --> 04:34.840
I saw Jackie... making out with the guy
from the cheese shop!

04:36.480 --> 04:38.600
The little dude!

04:38.680 --> 04:40.520
No way!

04:40.600 --> 04:43.840
Yup. But you're the only one I told,
so don't say a word to anyone.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.840
Okay, my little
Secret Squirrel?

04:48.480 --> 04:51.120
My lips are sealed.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.600
Good. 'Cause I knew
I could count on you.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.480
You always can.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.480
Think about it.
We hold information...

04:59.520 --> 05:02.720
that could crush the very heart and soul
of one of our best friends.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.320
I live for days like this!

05:07.400 --> 05:10.520
Oh, but just remember,
you're the only one I told.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.800
Your secret's safe with me.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.000
Well, you missed
a nice dinner.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.400
Joanne said
the funniest thing.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.000
She said I was gonna end up
a Corvette widow.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.560
Isn't that a kick?

05:33.640 --> 05:37.000
Oh, Kitty,
I wouldn't leave you for the car.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.000
Who'd make dinner?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.440
Oh, no.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.280
I think it's the time
to prove Joanne wrong.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.160
How are you gonna
prove Joanne wrong?

05:53.240 --> 05:58.200
What surprising and thoughtful deed
are you gonna do to prove Joanne wrong?

05:59.240 --> 06:03.520
I'm gonna prove
Joanne wrong by...

06:03.600 --> 06:05.440
taking you out...

06:07.040 --> 06:10.480
on a...
special date...

06:10.560 --> 06:13.080
soon.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.720
- Tomorrow.
- Good answer!

06:19.360 --> 06:22.840
Oh, hey, guys.
It's Kelso's loyal girlfriend, Jackie.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.320
Hi, Jackie!

06:28.800 --> 06:31.320
Okay, I'm not here to stay.
I just came to get Michael. Come on.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.960
Oh, no, stay.
We're just gonna hang out and fool around.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.280
We all know
how much you like to...

06:38.200 --> 06:40.040
fool around.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.320
Okay, Michael, come on.
Let's go to The Hub.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.440
No, I want to stay here
and fool around!

06:46.520 --> 06:49.880
So, hey, Jackie, how's it going
down at the cheese shop?

06:49.960 --> 06:52.960
You must be so tired from
giving it away at the mall.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.640
- What are you laughing at?
- I don't know. What are you laughing at?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.560
I don't know.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.080
- What are you laughing at?
- I don't know.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.880
What are you laughing at?

07:08.080 --> 07:10.400
I <i>really</i> don't know.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.160
- Come on, Michael. Let's go!
- No, let's stay.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.080
We could play Monopoly!

07:15.160 --> 07:19.440
Oh, but that wouldn't be much fun,
since we all know that... Jackie cheats.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.400
I do not!

07:22.480 --> 07:25.360
Oh, you do cheat.
We've all caught you.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.760
Red, this is supposed to be
our special date.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.760
There is nothing special
about an auto show!

07:38.760 --> 07:44.160
Oh, no? How 'bout it's special
'cause you're the only woman here.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
You're the queen
of the auto show!

07:48.000 --> 07:51.640
- Lord, grant me the serenity to accept...
- Oh, come on, Kitty.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.560
It'll be fun.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.760
You're always saying how we
should share each other's interests.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.080
I only said that to get you
to go to the Figurine Festival.

08:04.080 --> 08:09.000
Okay, I do. I want us to share our interests,
so... I'll start.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.920
Teach me about cars.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.840
I'm excited!

08:12.920 --> 08:14.760
That's my girl.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.000
Holy crap!

08:17.080 --> 08:19.360
Look at the paint job
on that T-bird.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.000
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.960
Wait, wait.
Wait here?

08:24.000 --> 08:28.240
Well, someone's gotta guard the car.
Who better than the queen?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.960
<i>Not on the bumper!</i>

08:39.640 --> 08:42.039
Oh, Jackie, great. Just the person
I was looking for.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.360
Look, I've got this... itch
right above my shoulder.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.280
Be a good girl.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.320
Give...
Give a little scratch.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.920
Eric, I came here to talk to you
about what happened yesterday.

08:56.960 --> 09:01.720
Okay, but I can't hear you
if you're not scratchin'.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.200
Yeah!

09:10.280 --> 09:14.240
Things between me and Michael
have been weird lately...

09:14.320 --> 09:19.360
and when Todd kissed me, I guess I
just gave in 'cause I felt vulnerable.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.400
But I made
a terrible mistake.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.800
And I was hoping you'd
show me some compassion.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.760
Compassion. Wait, is that the feeling
you get when someone just shined your shoes?

09:30.880 --> 09:34.360
Because if so,
you are in luck.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.600
And... go.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.960
You know what?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.880
I don't think so.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.040
See, I may have kissed Todd...

09:47.120 --> 09:49.840
but you knew about it all along
and didn't tell Michael.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.920
And that is way worse
than what I did.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.800
Wait, what?

09:55.840 --> 09:59.000
Yeah. See, girlfriends
are supposed to lie.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.040
That's what we do.

10:02.080 --> 10:06.360
But best friends are supposed to be loyal,
and you weren't.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.920
So guess what? You're screwed,
'cause I'm telling Michael everything!

10:12.080 --> 10:15.160
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I <i>so</i> would!

10:15.240 --> 10:16.920
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

10:16.960 --> 10:19.000
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

10:19.080 --> 10:21.240
Well... Well, this certainly
blew up in my face!

10:27.420 --> 10:31.460
When I tell Michael what you did,
he's gonna forget all about what I did.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.180
Unless I get to him first.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.340
You wouldn't.

10:36.420 --> 10:39.940
Well, to quote a certain manager-kissing
cheese maiden I know...

10:40.020 --> 10:42.300
"I <i>so</i> would!"

10:45.020 --> 10:47.340
And... go!

11:09.500 --> 11:11.540
- Not here!
- Damn it!

11:12.700 --> 11:15.260
Okay, Todd, like,
I know we kissed...

11:15.340 --> 11:18.620
and it was probably, like,
the best kiss you'll ever have.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.420
But it didn't mean anything,
and nothing's gonna come of it.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.500
So you're gonna have to get over me.
Oh, you know what?

11:23.580 --> 11:25.620
Please don't fire me,
because I really need this job.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.580
Okay? Great.
See you tomorrow!

11:34.380 --> 11:36.820
Look, Kelso,
I am so sorry!

11:36.900 --> 11:39.220
- Get out of my way.
- Wait, Michael!

11:42.860 --> 11:45.620
Great.
He hates me, right?

11:45.660 --> 11:47.900
No. He hates <i>me.</i>

11:48.940 --> 11:51.020
We didn't even
talk about you.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.220
I mean, I told him about the kiss,
and he just stormed off.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.140
I couldn't even
tell him I'm sorry.

11:58.340 --> 12:02.620
Okay, well... I'm not going
to feel sorry for you, so...

12:04.540 --> 12:08.260
Yeah. I mean,
y-you can't make me.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.140
I just love him so much.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.740
Oh, God.

12:15.780 --> 12:19.220
Okay, look.
Jackie.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.860
I-It's just
one kiss, right?

12:21.940 --> 12:23.780
That's not so bad.

12:23.860 --> 12:28.900
Just tell Kelso what you told me about,
you know, how you felt vulnerable and stuff.

12:28.980 --> 12:31.820
Now he doesn't even
want to see me.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.060
So, you know what?

12:35.140 --> 12:37.660
We'll go hang out in my basement
and wait for him to come by.

12:37.740 --> 12:41.460
He left his bouncy ball there, so, you know,
he's bound to be by sometime.

12:43.780 --> 12:45.660
You'd do that for me?

12:47.660 --> 12:49.500
As long as you promise
not to rat me out.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.060
Deal.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.220
So, friends?

12:55.300 --> 12:58.260
As long as you promise
not to tell people we're friends.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.540
You guys are never
gonna believe this.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.060
Jackie cheated on me.

13:10.140 --> 13:12.260
With the cheese guy!

13:15.460 --> 13:17.940
No!

13:19.500 --> 13:23.020
Yeah. I was just
as shocked as you are.

13:23.100 --> 13:27.020
Well, thank God
all she did was kiss him.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.580
Yeah.

13:29.660 --> 13:33.300
Wait. How do you know
all she did was kiss him?

13:34.740 --> 13:37.460
Kiss?

13:37.500 --> 13:40.580
Gee, I...
I didn't say "kiss."

13:40.660 --> 13:42.540
Don't make fun of my accent.

13:44.060 --> 13:48.260
That cheese guy's lucky he's a little fella,
or I'd kick his ass.

13:48.340 --> 13:51.380
Just, boom!
Right in the ass!

13:52.540 --> 13:55.500
Hey, man, you gotta
kick his ass.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.420
Like, on <i>Fantasy Island...</i>

13:57.500 --> 14:01.780
if Tattoo took one of Mr. Roarke's women
up to his little tower and put it to her...

14:01.860 --> 14:05.100
Roarke would slap that little dude
like a drunk Southern widow!

14:06.500 --> 14:08.980
Then he'd hit him off
with some vicious voodoo.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.980
Voodoo on Tattoo.

14:13.060 --> 14:16.060
Voodoo.
Tattoo.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.980
Peekaboo.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.460
Honeydew.
Kung fu.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.420
Koo-koo-ka-choo.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.900
I'm done.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.460
Well, look who's finally back.

14:38.140 --> 14:42.260
While you were gone, some guy came by
to compliment me on my headlights.

14:44.540 --> 14:48.060
Pretty sure he wasn't
talkin' about the car!

14:49.500 --> 14:51.380
I got us funnel cakes!

14:52.540 --> 14:54.500
It's like a second honeymoon.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.460
Kitty, not in the car.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.340
Hey, nice Vette.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.420
You should come see
the custom job I did on mine.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.340
Cost me three grand
and a marriage.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.860
- Three grand?
- And a marriage!

15:14.180 --> 15:16.340
I'll only be a minute, Kitty.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.460
What are you lookin' at,
gearhead?

15:43.900 --> 15:46.180
Your ass is mine,
cheese puff!

15:46.260 --> 15:48.660
How did you know
my nickname?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.780
Wait, your nickname's
cheese puff?

15:52.420 --> 15:54.500
Stay focused.
Kick his ass!

15:54.580 --> 15:56.660
Yeah, right.
Good. Yeah.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.300
What do you think you're doing
kissing my girlfriend huh? Huh?

15:59.380 --> 16:02.100
Well, maybe if you paid more attention
to that gorgeous creature...

16:02.140 --> 16:06.300
than your little modeling gig,
it wouldn't have happened.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.220
Little?

16:08.300 --> 16:12.060
That picture sold hundreds of young men's
briefs all over the greater Kenosha area!

16:13.540 --> 16:16.740
It's true. I bought three pairs.
Very supportive.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.620
Yeah, so look.

16:20.700 --> 16:24.300
I know you're a little fella, but I can't
let you go around kissin' my girlfriend.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.220
So you're gonna
have to take a punch.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.620
I understand.

16:33.820 --> 16:37.140
That didn't look
like it hurt him at all.

16:37.220 --> 16:39.060
Well, I guess
it's my turn.

16:39.140 --> 16:42.140
Okay. I didn't mean to scare you,
little guy.

16:44.340 --> 16:46.700
I'm a black belt.

16:46.780 --> 16:49.460
All right!
Didn't see that coming!

16:52.860 --> 16:55.020
Thanks to your
funnel-cake accident...

16:55.100 --> 16:57.700
I'll have to spend half the night
cleaning out the car.

16:57.780 --> 17:00.500
Well, I hope you two
will be very happy together.

17:03.900 --> 17:08.980
Mrs. Forman! Mrs. Forman,
I have a black eye, and I need ice!

17:09.020 --> 17:12.060
I'm not doing anything else
for men today.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.980
- Just go away.
- No. I'm not gonna go away.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.180
I'm having a really bad day.

17:19.260 --> 17:21.619
I got decked by a guy
who kissed Jackie.

17:21.660 --> 17:24.060
He was huge.

17:24.099 --> 17:27.700
And she thinks that it was okay to kiss him,
because I've been ignorin' her for work.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.660
Which I barely did!

17:29.700 --> 17:33.460
And I got a black eye,
and I need someone to care about me!

17:33.500 --> 17:35.620
Well, well, well.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.060
Michael ignored Jackie,
and she kissed another boy.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.580
That is completely different!

17:40.660 --> 17:44.460
He ignored her for a stupid job.
I ignored you for a car!

17:44.540 --> 17:47.860
- Crap.
- Oh, burn!

17:47.900 --> 17:51.140
How many times
you want to get hit today?

17:53.660 --> 17:57.660
Kitty, I'm sorry.

17:57.740 --> 18:01.500
Next time, I'll be happy
to forget about the car...

18:01.580 --> 18:04.900
and go to whatever figurine...

18:04.980 --> 18:09.380
quilting, macramé,
man-killing thing you want to do.

18:11.820 --> 18:15.460
Actually, there's a knitting bee
at the community center right now.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.500
You're kidding.

18:17.580 --> 18:21.180
And you know what they say
about those knitters:

18:21.260 --> 18:24.220
They spin quite a yarn!

18:26.140 --> 18:28.420
You know what would really
teach me a lesson?

18:28.500 --> 18:33.380
Leaving me at home to, you know,
think about what I've done.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.020
If you're not in that car in two seconds,
I'll make you carry my knitting basket.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.620
Coming, dear.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.140
Wait, wait, wait.
So Kelso got beat up?

18:43.220 --> 18:46.140
Yeah, by the little dude
at the cheese shop.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.900
It was awesome, man.

18:48.980 --> 18:51.540
Like a hurricane of tiny fists.

18:53.180 --> 18:57.060
All right, look. Jackie, here's the deal.
You cheated on me.

18:57.140 --> 18:59.860
- You used to cheat on me all the time!
- Yeah?

18:59.900 --> 19:02.100
Well, yeah.

19:03.500 --> 19:08.140
But you cheated out of hate,
and I cheated out of joy.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.580
I didn't cheat
out of hate, Michael.

19:11.660 --> 19:14.940
I cheated because lately,
you've been acting like I don't exist.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.020
Well, I sure know you exist
now that you Frenched the whole mall!

19:19.940 --> 19:22.540
Look, I know that
I need to pay more attention to you...

19:22.620 --> 19:24.460
and I want to forgive you...

19:24.540 --> 19:27.820
but I have all this anger built up
inside of me and nowhere to put it.

19:30.580 --> 19:34.620
Eric knew about the kiss
all along and didn't tell you.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.220
- You knew?
- Jackie.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.260
What'd you expect?

19:43.780 --> 19:45.660
You're a dead man, Forman!

19:45.700 --> 19:47.660
Get him, Michael!

19:53.420 --> 19:56.820
Well, guys, uh,
just so you're up to speed...

19:56.900 --> 20:00.140
I knew about the kiss all along.

20:02.140 --> 20:06.820
Eric told me.
He made me his Secret Squirrel.

20:09.420 --> 20:14.100
What? That dill-hole said
I was the only one he told.

20:14.140 --> 20:16.780
- Me too!
- Me too!

20:16.860 --> 20:20.060
It was hilarious. You guys should've seen it.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.220
Kelso's foot got stuck
in a gopher hole, and... and...

20:23.260 --> 20:26.380
Hey, w... w-why are you guys
all looking at me like that?

20:27.740 --> 20:31.540
I was your Secret Squirrel?
You son of a bitch!

20:34.300 --> 20:36.180
<i>Get him!</i>

20:49.200 --> 20:52.240
The '58's the only one
with the chrome detail.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.040
Mmm.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.280
Men and cars.
Never got it, never will.
