Many have told it.

01:19.328 --> 01:23.790

- Be quiet!
- Laertes, I'm coming with you!

02:45.998 --> 02:47.667
Don't!

02:50.294 --> 02:52.919
- Go back, Ophelia!
- But think of all the books!

02:52.921 --> 02:56.884
So, students as well.
Very sweet.

02:58.427 --> 03:00.303
I'll teach you later.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.013
Hush now, make ready
for your studies.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.108
- Watch out for dragons!
- Dragons?

03:15.110 --> 03:16.651
It's a shortcut.

03:16.653 --> 03:18.446
Brace of rabbits for skinning.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.530
- Ooh, little rascal!
- Oi!

03:20.532 --> 03:21.992
Ophelia!

03:29.167 --> 03:31.750
- Don't!
- Leave me. I want to see.

03:44.306 --> 03:45.889
To Prince Hamlet!

03:45.891 --> 03:49.185
Leaving us for the great
University of Wittenberg.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.561
Fifteen years old today.

03:51.563 --> 03:55.067
Little more than a boy,
little less than a man.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.693
He insults the prince?

03:57.695 --> 03:59.237
That's his uncle,
the king's brother.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.864
Apple of his mother's eye.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.990
Of course, it was an apple
that tempted a woman

04:03.992 --> 04:05.410
in the Garden of Eden.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.703
I had always thought
it was a snake.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.748
It was an apple of knowledge,
and knowledge kills innocence

04:10.750 --> 04:12.583
as surely as winter snow
kills summer blooms.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.001
Ophelia!

04:14.003 --> 04:16.170
Then I fear for my son
at university

04:16.172 --> 04:18.423
where they will fill him
with knowledge.

04:20.552 --> 04:23.803
- To the prince!
- To the prince!

04:23.805 --> 04:27.809
May he someday rise
from his mother's lap.

04:30.269 --> 04:33.437
I think the apple is quite
innocent in the matter.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.858
Ophelia!

04:36.442 --> 04:39.026
What is an Ophelia?

04:39.028 --> 04:40.945
Your Majesty, it is a child

04:40.947 --> 04:43.781
very much like
a snake's tooth and

04:43.783 --> 04:48.286
a true snake she is,
in the garden of my duty.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.579
She?

04:50.581 --> 04:53.166
The exact copy and very picture

04:53.168 --> 04:55.793
of her departed
and much lamented mother.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.799
My Ophelia, my daughter,
my treasure.

05:09.016 --> 05:11.353
A treasure most in want
of polishing.

05:12.269 --> 05:13.935
This is ladies' work to polish

05:13.937 --> 05:16.565
such a treasure, and alas,
I am no lady.

05:17.858 --> 05:19.733
Alas indeed.

05:19.735 --> 05:23.822
I may be a lass, but there is no
call for such alas-ing.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.076
I would not want to be a lad.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.997
Then she shall be
one of my ladies

05:32.999 --> 05:35.457
and we shall see
to the raising of her.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.677
- Let me go!
- Hold still. Stop moving.

05:47.805 --> 05:51.183
- Hold still.
- Absolutely tragic.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.519
Oh, dear.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.480
Stop!

06:27.887 --> 06:30.223
- She's fair for you.
- Ah, nonsense.

06:34.935 --> 06:36.854
You dance like a goat, Ophelia.

07:38.540 --> 07:40.457
Her father's a flatterer.

07:40.459 --> 07:43.627
He wormed his way in
through dirt.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.380
Have you seen
how she wears flowers

07:45.382 --> 07:47.798
never jewels in her hair?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.966
I thought she'd been
rolling in the dirt.

07:49.968 --> 07:52.055
She smells of garden soil.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.977
Her father can't afford jewels.
She is common.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.021
Whatever does she see in her?

08:06.735 --> 08:07.944
There you are, Ophelia.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.781
What took you
so long this time?

08:10.531 --> 08:12.281
Watch yourself.

08:15.577 --> 08:17.036
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.165
Quick, before the water cools.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.628
What do I smell?
Like a garden.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.512
Petals for my bath?
Go ahead.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.850
What a lovely idea, girls,
thank you.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.978
You are most welcome, My Lady.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.456
Goodnight.
Take the candles.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.543
My eyes are too weary to read.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.378
I could read to you, My Lady.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.884
A girl who knows how to read?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.554
My brother teaches me.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.890
Goodnight, my queen.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.018
Sleep well, My Lady.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.562
My Lady.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.906
Shut the door behind you.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.918
Have you seen how the hens in
the yard peck at each other?

09:47.044 --> 09:49.088
Each choosing
the one just weaker.

09:50.005 --> 09:51.841
Why do the ladies peck at you?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.261
I'm not noble, My Lady.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.603
Did you know
I was not raised at court?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.022
My sister and I were sent as
girls to a convent in France.

10:09.024 --> 10:12.694
But even there, there were hens
and they pecked.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.406
Even the nuns?

10:16.615 --> 10:18.784
But I had my sister
to defend me.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.417
Read to me, then.
If you really can.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.969
"A woman of Alencon

10:37.971 --> 10:41.638
"having married for her profit..

10:41.640 --> 10:46.145
...found a gentleman
who offered her pleasure."

10:48.981 --> 10:50.649
This is no devotional book.

10:53.485 --> 10:55.779
Something much more important
than prayer.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.323
Read on.

11:04.371 --> 11:08.416
"The gentleman caused her
to find herself

11:08.418 --> 11:11.129
"alone with him in an orchard.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.216
"Here he said unto her..

11:16.842 --> 11:20.179
"'Madam, my heart
belongs to you.'

11:25.393 --> 11:28.937
"She protested that he loved
her rank alone.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.191
"And he replied,
'Madam, nothing could add

11:34.193 --> 11:37.195
"'to your graces,
except the one thing

11:37.197 --> 11:40.240
"'that can make a face more
beautiful, which is..

11:41.201 --> 11:42.869
"'...transformation..

11:43.535 --> 11:44.912
...in ecstasy.'"

12:01.136 --> 12:05.430
"'My Lord gratifies me
so much, ' replied she.

12:05.432 --> 12:08.725
"I do not ask
for any other thing.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.896
"'Have mercy, good lady, '
cried he

12:11.898 --> 12:14.401
"'for I am gone mad with love.'

12:17.903 --> 12:20.905
"At this, the lady did swoon.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.742
"Then the gentleman,
seeing her half-conquered

12:24.744 --> 12:27.036
"plied her to good purpose

12:27.038 --> 12:29.957
with his
long-concealed passion."

12:45.139 --> 12:47.140
The prince! The prince!
He comes!

12:49.144 --> 12:51.643
- Here he is!
- Look at this, Horatio.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.770
I told you we'd have a welcome.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.732
Oh, and so handsome, so grown.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.608
Every inch a king.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.200
- My dear son!
- Mm!

13:09.038 --> 13:11.665
- It's good to be home.
- Yes.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.042
Come, Horatio.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.587
Don't wanna lose you
at the end of the journey.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.549
And now we feast.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.317
I remember this as an
excellent place to fish.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.865
Come away, Hamlet.
Let's, let's try farther down.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.079
A wondrous fish indeed,
inhabits the grove.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.997
The fish would like
to come ashore.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.623
Oh, the fish is very welcome.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.166
No fish comes willing
to the fisherman.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.835
My Lord, it's one of the
queen's ladies in waiting.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.464
Then she will not mind waiting
till I catch a fish.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.760
Of all of the ladies,
I'm least fond of waiting.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.276
There are two sides
struggling in you.

14:23.278 --> 14:26.030
One is baser, one better.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.199
She tells my fortune, Horatio.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.161
My Lord, it is your misfortune.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.998
- Come away, Hamlet.
- Stay.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.634
'Tis a quick fish, Horatio!

14:46.594 --> 14:48.344
Get me my net!

14:48.346 --> 14:51.057
Such lovely shades
and so lifelike.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.017
And these threads.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.229
Oh, for a moment
alone in the forest.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.938
And almost naked.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.357
Who do you suppose she'll meet
under that greenwood tree?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.901
Well, perhaps she has a
rendezvous with some suitor.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.695
Yes!

15:05.697 --> 15:07.030
Have you ever ventured
into the woods

15:07.032 --> 15:08.238
outside the castle, My Lady?

15:08.240 --> 15:10.574
No, I do not like
the woods myself.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.951
Oh, I would not dare.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.412
Unaccompanied, indeed.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.791
Hamlet, come.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.003
Do you like it?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.464
Most lifelike.

15:24.466 --> 15:27.259
When I am finished,
it will be truer than life.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.554
Oh, where's the hunter?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.599
See, he has left
his arrows there.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.144
Those are her arrows.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.354
Go on, Ophelia.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.273
She is Diana,
goddess of the hunt.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.027
She made her home
in the forest.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.324
She knew no man until the
hunter Actaeon came upon her.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.910
A hunter, not a fisherman?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.996
He hid and watched her bathe.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.040
Was he punished
for this trespass?

15:59.042 --> 16:00.377
Mercilessly.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.506
Diana turned him into a stag and
his own hounds tore him apart.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.218
And do you ladies think this
punishment was fit?

16:10.220 --> 16:12.013
Hasn't that ever been the story?

16:12.971 --> 16:15.473
Beauty turns men to beasts.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.771
I'd always pictured
the goddess as a girl.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.401
You know, youthful, impulsive.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.151
Diana is too aged
in this weaving.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.573
She is depicted as the queen,
your mother, My Lord.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.540
It's a wretched likeness.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.875
Unpick your threads
and begin again.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.343
- Fetch her tonic.
- Quickly, after the queen.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.521
Where could she be? I hope
she's gone to her chambers.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.650
How did you lose sight of her?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.360
Perhaps she's retired
to her chamber.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.446
- Come quick.
- I mean, really, it's fine.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.658
Well, she doesn't
look aged at all.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.340
Have you lost your way?

17:37.723 --> 17:40.391
I've lived plenty long enough
to know my way

17:40.393 --> 17:42.934
and not yet long enough
to forget it.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.943
Your son has returned..

17:51.403 --> 17:53.239
...you should be all joy.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.742
And, yet, I think you pine.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.705
It is difficult for a mother
when her boy

18:02.707 --> 18:06.461
becomes a man
and no longer hers.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.505
If I were your son,
I would not soon forget you.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.923
And yet you are not my son,
but my brother.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.220
In law, I am your brother.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.598
But I've never much
loved the law.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.063
The gossips say there are many
other things you love.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.774
The gossips are mistaken.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.903
There's only the one thing.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.681
It's very close in here.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.222
Perhaps I need some air.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.433
I often feel as you do
at night.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.643
I take my air on the parapets.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.355
You will find me there.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.948
No. I will not.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.673
How now, Ophelia?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.471
For a flash I thought
you were a ghost.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.057
At school we dissected
a corpse into his parts.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.184
There was no room
for his ghost.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.478
I shall have to take your word
for it, My Lord.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.191
I know nothing of the parts
of men.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.615
You stop my heart.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.994
If your heart stopped,
you would die.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.873
I seem to be quite alive.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.875
Appearances deceive.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.547
See this.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.048
An innocent flower.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.804
And yet it is belladonna,
the most deadly nightshade.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.308
Belladonna means
beautiful woman.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.730
And you say it is poison.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.115
Will you promise to dance
with me someday?

20:42.116 --> 20:43.742
I'm afraid
I dance like a goat.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.759
You excel today, My Lord.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.934
Nephew. Come.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.061
Try your learning.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.313
I would not want to wound you.

21:14.315 --> 21:17.984
Nor I you.
We'll, uh, we'll fight in fun.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.861
I find no fun in fighting.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.321
The winning knight
shall wear my colors.

21:22.323 --> 21:26.784
Rogue. Seems you wear
a lady's colors already.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.246
And you've chosen well if the
girl's as bawdy as her colors.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.290
You watch yourself.

21:34.586 --> 21:38.046
Ah, there's hot blood
in the boy after all.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.515
Well done, Hamlet.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.600
Hamlet!

21:50.602 --> 21:51.767
You debate what to do next.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.478
And, meanwhile,
you do next to nothing.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.115
Your sword, My Lord.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.409
Here...

22:17.420 --> 22:19.005
It seems I was mistaken.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.922
You have much to learn.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.219
I prefer not to learn
at the point of a sword.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.094
My sharpness is within.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.434
Marvelous creature!

23:24.028 --> 23:25.529
A dragonfly!

23:43.714 --> 23:45.299
A dragonfly!

23:51.221 --> 23:52.973
Do not play with me.

23:58.188 --> 23:59.898
Oh! Beautiful!

25:06.506 --> 25:08.133
Little fish needs water?

25:09.384 --> 25:10.801
Not water.

25:12.470 --> 25:13.971
Wine?

25:30.488 --> 25:34.116
Some would say that's a pledge,
to drink wine from the same cup.

25:44.085 --> 25:46.209
We mustn't.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.636
I will be missed.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.530
I feel like a lance has gone
in between my ears.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.617
I don't think I've ever felt
like this before, Horatio.

26:18.619 --> 26:19.870
I hope you haven't.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.413
Morning, My Lady.

26:23.415 --> 26:27.209
- Did you enjoy the dancing?
- I enjoyed the evening.

26:27.211 --> 26:30.505
It's difficult to enjoy both the
evening and the morning after.

26:30.507 --> 26:33.423
Uh, thank God
this summer is over.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.344
My studies hurt my head a little
less than my leisure.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.470
You're returning
to your studies?

26:38.472 --> 26:40.599
Uh, we go to Wittenberg today.

26:44.395 --> 26:47.106
- My Lord.
- Leave it all for the pigs.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.401
There was a young prince
from the Netherlands

26:52.403 --> 26:54.780
who decided to seek out
the treasury.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.116
Ophelia.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.619
- I always meant to say goodbye.
- Goodbye.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.911
Last night, Ophelia. It was...

27:02.913 --> 27:04.956
You'll foul your breeches,
My Lord.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.127
Well, then, goodbye.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.559
- Try to understand.
- I am trying.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.355
My father
would never allow it.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.815
He wishes me someday
to take his throne.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.566
And I am low.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.113
- No, Ophelia.
- I was deceived in you.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.157
I see now
that you are but a prince.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.120
Goodbye.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.336
♪ Doubt thou ♪

27:52.338 --> 27:56.507

28:39.719 --> 28:41.721
Do you know
the wood beneath the castle?

28:48.019 --> 28:49.811
I used to play at its edge.

28:49.813 --> 28:52.357
In the wood, lives a woman.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.111
Go to her tomorrow
and get me more of what I need.

28:58.113 --> 29:01.279
Make sure you're not followed.
No one must know.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.743
And whatever you do,
do not look upon her face.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.163
Because she is a witch?

29:14.628 --> 29:16.754
She's a healer.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.298
Her name is Mechtild.

30:41.674 --> 30:42.966
Hello?

31:09.035 --> 31:10.537
What do you want?

31:13.038 --> 31:15.081
I was sent by the queen.

31:15.083 --> 31:18.003
- What for?
- For what she needs.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.465
And what does she need?

31:25.676 --> 31:29.970
She needs her youth again.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.140
Rest from her desires.

31:32.142 --> 31:35.559
A night's sleep
without dreams.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.855
And a husband who mulls love,
not war.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.857
But what she wants..

31:41.859 --> 31:44.319
...is two ounces of my tonic.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.740
Don't touch that!

31:52.244 --> 31:53.871
I can't feel my fingertips.

31:58.585 --> 32:01.086
It's a snake's poison
from the New World.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.600
A touch of it
makes the flesh numb.

32:15.602 --> 32:17.519
Too much of it will kill.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.774
Could I learn such secrets?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.860
You're a lady in waiting.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.946
Learn to wait.

32:28.615 --> 32:29.949
For what?

32:31.951 --> 32:34.120
A husband, little girl,
what else?

32:45.589 --> 32:48.048
And there's no time
for my brother's games.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.883
Norway threatens invasion.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.427
Every day is a struggle
for peace.

32:51.429 --> 32:54.430
- It was all in play.
- He plays the fool.

32:54.432 --> 32:56.599
While we're on the brink of war
with our neighbors.

32:56.601 --> 32:58.767
Do not speak ill
of your brother.

32:58.769 --> 33:02.729
Claudius shares my name, but the
blood in his veins is impure.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.065
We've all heard that story.
There's no cause to believe it.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.942
Well, he's his mother's son,
alright, but there is nothing

33:06.944 --> 33:08.068
of my father in him.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.528
Now you insult your mother?

33:09.530 --> 33:11.281
She's no worse
than any other woman.

33:17.705 --> 33:21.373
- Remember yourself, my queen.
- Stay with me, talk to me.

33:21.375 --> 33:25.085
I... I have become
invisible to you.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.504
You're more visible
than you realize.

33:26.506 --> 33:29.175
All eyes are on you.
Can you not feel them?

33:30.801 --> 33:32.219
My kingdom needs me.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.284
Give yourself a bit of a fright,
did you?

35:21.286 --> 35:22.579
I saw something.

35:24.081 --> 35:25.706
A specter.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.626
Past your bedtime, eh?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.797
And up here's not a place
for a girl.

35:41.266 --> 35:42.892
Tell me, brother..

35:44.436 --> 35:47.021
...how do they know
what is inside a person?

35:48.523 --> 35:52.027
There are men who steal corpses
from the graveyard for study.

35:56.322 --> 36:00.452
What I really wonder is,
where does love reside?

36:01.452 --> 36:04.329
Where truth, or madness?

36:06.498 --> 36:08.375
The only answers
are from science.

36:10.711 --> 36:13.338
I did hear the prince's friend,
Horatio, he..

36:13.340 --> 36:16.673
...bribed the gravediggers
to dig up a corpse.

36:20.597 --> 36:23.014
Rosencrantz? Guildenstern!
What's happened?

36:23.016 --> 36:26.059
The king! Long live the king!

36:34.193 --> 36:35.820
Get to your posts!

36:39.199 --> 36:41.699
- Aah!
- The king.

36:41.701 --> 36:44.327
Bitten by a poisonous snake
in his own garden.

36:44.329 --> 36:45.663
He's sick?

36:46.789 --> 36:48.206
He's dead.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.173
Father wrote to Hamlet.
He should be here.

38:20.175 --> 38:22.967
On a day such as this?
He should be far away.

38:28.391 --> 38:31.601
Long live King Claudius!

38:31.603 --> 38:36.356
Duly elected,
brave and sober majesty.

38:36.358 --> 38:38.485
- Long live the king.
- Long live the king.

38:43.072 --> 38:44.656
Your Majesty.

38:46.159 --> 38:49.452
Your Majesty,
honor us on this day.

38:49.454 --> 38:51.871
- They're lovely, thank you.
- Your Majesty.

38:51.873 --> 38:53.416
Here, take these.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.210
Look at you.

38:57.295 --> 38:59.128
You will be one of my ladies.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.005
Today the queen loves me
above the rest.

39:01.007 --> 39:02.632
But she is fickle..

39:02.634 --> 39:05.175
...and another day you might be
back in favor.

39:05.177 --> 39:08.179
Say not she is fickle.
It is too much said.

39:08.181 --> 39:11.226
A kingdom needs a king
and a king needs a wife.

39:12.936 --> 39:14.394
Why should she be
anything else?

39:14.396 --> 39:16.690
She was already a king's wife.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.610
- Oh!
- Is my father buried?

39:22.445 --> 39:23.905
Long since, My Lord.

39:28.492 --> 39:31.829
Hamlet!
You were so long returning.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.956
So long that the funeral wreaths
are already taken down?

39:35.958 --> 39:39.376
Welcome, Hamlet. We are most
happy you are returned.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.461
Too late, it seems.

39:40.463 --> 39:43.046
Too late to honor
your late father.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.215
It seems my father's honor
is much besmirched.

39:45.217 --> 39:49.431
He grieves, commendably, as
every son who loses a father.

39:51.099 --> 39:54.182
His father lost a father once,
who was my father also.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.811
We were ever men about it.

39:56.813 --> 39:59.063
Man indeed to seduce a woman
to take a crown.

39:59.065 --> 40:01.566
- Hamlet.
- You forget yourself.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.526
The nobles held their election.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.487
I seem to be the only one
present who does not forget.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.742
You forget how to greet a king!

40:21.920 --> 40:25.966
I am your king.

41:14.516 --> 41:16.059
Come, Gertrude.

41:17.268 --> 41:18.561
Let us eat.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.637
- Hey!
- Give it back.

42:01.938 --> 42:03.854
Stop it.

42:05.900 --> 42:07.777
Look, we've caught ourselves
a pheasant.

42:09.445 --> 42:11.072
Get off her!

42:12.740 --> 42:14.159
Or what?

42:21.750 --> 42:23.166
Come on.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.086
Let me loose.
You will pay for this.

42:27.088 --> 42:30.048
What? You want me to pay for it.
She wants me to pay for it!

42:30.050 --> 42:33.008
Let the maiden go.
This one really is a whore!

42:35.889 --> 42:38.514
The air smells very ripe.

42:38.516 --> 42:41.224
Perhaps a bath is in order.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.394
What'd you say to me? Huh?

42:43.396 --> 42:46.313
- Let her be!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:46.315 --> 42:47.440
Come away.

42:47.442 --> 42:49.527
Mastered by a maiden I see!

42:52.197 --> 42:55.075
Come away. Hamlet, no.
Come away.

43:01.121 --> 43:03.706
Thank you, Your Highness.
But I had no need of saving.

43:03.708 --> 43:07.043
You speak of need.
In need I sought you.

43:07.045 --> 43:08.586
I have missed you, Ophelia.

43:08.588 --> 43:10.463
I should apologize for my
behavior to you last summer.

43:10.465 --> 43:12.255
- You should?
- I do.

43:12.257 --> 43:14.508
- It is forgotten.
- Forgotten but not forgiven.

43:14.510 --> 43:15.927
Both.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.387
I have never forgotten you.

43:17.389 --> 43:19.099
You'll forgive me
if I doubt it.

43:23.478 --> 43:25.021
Where is the water, Ophelia?

43:26.271 --> 43:27.731
- Cover the queen.
- Hamlet.

43:28.733 --> 43:30.485
What is the matter?

43:32.653 --> 43:34.530
What forgetting is here?

43:36.240 --> 43:37.534
Hamlet?

43:43.706 --> 43:45.708
It is only a filthy
bit of ribbon.

43:47.376 --> 43:49.045
My tonic, please.

43:56.552 --> 43:57.552
Again.

44:02.349 --> 44:03.766
Farewell, sister.

44:03.768 --> 44:05.476
I'm to continue my education
in France.

44:05.478 --> 44:06.561
You are leaving?

44:06.563 --> 44:08.479
These are strange times
in this castle.

44:08.481 --> 44:09.816
Strange indeed.

44:11.483 --> 44:14.151
Rumors abound
of all shapes and sizes.

44:14.153 --> 44:15.987
All of them frighten me.

44:15.989 --> 44:19.072
They are saying the prince no
longer sees you as a child.

44:19.074 --> 44:20.701
I am no longer a child.

44:21.286 --> 44:22.327
Ophelia..

44:23.704 --> 44:25.412
...be afraid.

44:25.414 --> 44:27.039
Afraid of all
he can take from you.

44:27.041 --> 44:29.666
You will only be safe
if you are afraid.

44:29.668 --> 44:32.338
Tend to your own honor
and I will tend to mine.

44:33.882 --> 44:35.673
Laertes, hurry!

44:35.675 --> 44:38.553
Time and tide
wait for no man.

44:44.266 --> 44:46.184
Now..

44:46.186 --> 44:48.853
...my blessing on you, son.

44:48.855 --> 44:51.731
Now, remember,
keep your own counsel.

44:51.733 --> 44:54.900
Don't be familiar or vulgar.

44:54.902 --> 44:57.320
And don't fight,
or if you do, win.

44:57.322 --> 45:00.365
Um, dress well.
But don't spend too much.

45:00.367 --> 45:02.867
Don't borrow any money
or lend it.

45:02.869 --> 45:06.206
And above all,
be true to yourself.

45:08.123 --> 45:09.583
Farewell, father.

45:11.043 --> 45:12.793
And take care, Ophelia.

45:12.795 --> 45:14.380
Remember what I said.

45:19.177 --> 45:23.429
- What did he say?
- Something about Lord Hamlet.

45:23.431 --> 45:25.474
Ah, yes, Hamlet.

45:26.893 --> 45:29.936
They say he ran
into the queen's chamber

45:29.938 --> 45:33.563
and stared at you
and spoke very strangely.

45:33.565 --> 45:35.025
I saw it, yes.

45:36.860 --> 45:41.613
Did he bestow on you
some... sign of love?

45:41.615 --> 45:43.282
No.

45:43.284 --> 45:44.744
Are you lying to me, daughter?

45:45.786 --> 45:47.494
Yes.

45:47.496 --> 45:50.750
A lying yes
is equal to a no.

45:51.793 --> 45:52.751
No.

45:54.420 --> 45:55.587
So, yes?

45:57.798 --> 46:01.008
This could prove
very advantageous for us.

46:01.010 --> 46:02.971
I want nothing
to do with him, father.

46:05.056 --> 46:07.891
You're a very bad girl
to be so good.

46:15.983 --> 46:18.068
Ophelia. Come in.

46:20.030 --> 46:22.530
Girls are not allowed
in the library..

46:22.532 --> 46:23.990
...unless they're in the books.

46:23.992 --> 46:27.245
Yet I think you have been
in here before. Come in.

46:43.135 --> 46:44.927
I wish someday to be a healer.

46:44.929 --> 46:46.804
There are many different kinds
of healer.

46:46.806 --> 46:49.807
A doctor then,
a man of science.

46:49.809 --> 46:52.479
You know graves are robbed
for such science?

46:53.771 --> 46:55.354
Look, Hamlet is much distressed.

46:55.356 --> 46:57.481
He behaves wildly towards me.

46:57.483 --> 47:00.443
But there is a method
in his madness. Trust me.

47:00.445 --> 47:02.155
Go to him, please.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.324
Where?

47:06.326 --> 47:08.034
The ramparts..

47:08.036 --> 47:09.244
...at midnight.

47:14.958 --> 47:17.584
Stay away from my grave
when I am dead.

47:17.586 --> 47:20.880
Ophelia, do not be so morbid.

47:20.882 --> 47:23.677
I have no interest in becoming
some man's anatomy lesson.

47:40.150 --> 47:43.195
- You tremble, Ophelia.
- You frightened me, My Lord.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.574
They are saying in the court
there is a ghost up here.

47:48.659 --> 47:50.077
I thought I saw it once myself.

47:51.788 --> 47:54.246
They say it is
my father's unquiet spirit.

47:55.416 --> 47:57.710
Careful, the sentinel comes.

48:16.938 --> 48:18.271
They say of all
the queen's ladies

48:18.273 --> 48:20.731
you are the one
who knows her secrets.

48:20.733 --> 48:23.568
To say you know a secret
is to tell the secret.

48:23.570 --> 48:26.612
Tell me only this, Ophelia.

48:26.614 --> 48:30.076
Was my mother true to my father,
her husband, the king?

48:30.744 --> 48:32.245
I cannot tell you.

48:37.791 --> 48:39.168
And yet you cannot lie.

48:45.050 --> 48:46.009
Fickle.

48:48.052 --> 48:51.095
My mother is like all women.
Fickle, frail.

48:51.097 --> 48:52.307
My Lord..

48:53.099 --> 48:55.307
...you are most unjust.

48:55.309 --> 48:58.394
Frailty in love
is not a habit of my sex.

48:58.396 --> 49:00.023
Perhaps it runs in families.

49:01.775 --> 49:03.026
Forgive me.

49:04.693 --> 49:06.445
I see now what people are..

49:08.114 --> 49:09.615
...and only you are not.

49:11.409 --> 49:12.827
Not you, Ophelia.

49:14.788 --> 49:16.454
Be comforted, My Lord.

49:16.456 --> 49:20.458
♪ The stars are fire.. ♪

49:20.460 --> 49:21.670
Ophelia..

49:23.170 --> 49:24.420
...my true love.

49:24.422 --> 49:29.592
♪ Doubt truth to be a liar ♪

49:29.594 --> 49:35.180
♪ But never doubt I love ♪♪

50:27.652 --> 50:28.695
The queen.

50:33.365 --> 50:35.575
She wants her tonic.

50:35.577 --> 50:40.623
Oh, she wants, she wants,
she gets what she wants.

50:42.041 --> 50:45.545
- She fears to feel.
- And you?

50:46.588 --> 50:48.256
What do you think you know?

50:50.382 --> 50:53.550
You pretend you have
a broken heart.

50:53.552 --> 50:57.304
That you are innocent
and wounded.

50:57.306 --> 51:02.059
But you cannot hide your true
self under ladies' clothes.

51:02.061 --> 51:04.604
You are wild and full of desire.

51:04.606 --> 51:07.148
They will strip you,
they will judge you

51:07.150 --> 51:10.070
and they will find you
wanting death.

51:13.405 --> 51:16.116
They will cast you to the fire.

51:20.579 --> 51:23.375
Do you know why they call me
a witch?

51:28.213 --> 51:30.755
At 19, I was with child

51:30.757 --> 51:34.425
by a man who swore
he'd marry me.

51:34.427 --> 51:36.969
When my baby died inside me

51:36.971 --> 51:41.139
rumors spread
it was the devil's work.

51:41.141 --> 51:44.726
The righteous came
to cast the devil out.

51:46.313 --> 51:47.729
Burn her!

51:47.731 --> 51:49.816
But they didn't know..

51:49.818 --> 51:52.153
...I knew my poisons.

51:53.780 --> 51:57.824
Three drops on the tongue, the
venom mimics death but mocks it.

51:57.826 --> 51:59.325
Burn the witch!

51:59.327 --> 52:00.829
They thought me dead.

52:02.454 --> 52:05.040
You drank the venom
but didn't die?

52:10.630 --> 52:12.963
They found my corpse,
threw me away

52:12.965 --> 52:15.426
and declared
the devil vanquished.

52:17.971 --> 52:22.434
I had my remedy laid by
and so I lived.

52:23.893 --> 52:25.311
But without my son.

52:28.815 --> 52:30.650
And what of his father?

52:36.072 --> 52:38.282
He was quite recently married.

53:06.186 --> 53:07.437
Ophelia.

53:11.648 --> 53:12.775
Ophelia.

53:25.829 --> 53:28.748
Confess to me,
the keeper of your soul.

53:28.750 --> 53:30.335
Do you love another?

53:32.753 --> 53:34.213
I love only you.

53:37.217 --> 53:40.052
Then meet me tomorrow
at the old chapel by the lake.

53:41.179 --> 53:42.970
Disguise yourself
as a country lass.

53:42.972 --> 53:44.262
And you a shepherd?

53:47.686 --> 53:50.103
There will be talk.
I fear there is already.

53:50.105 --> 53:51.438
Let them talk.

53:53.065 --> 53:54.233
Ophelia..

53:57.903 --> 53:59.572
...I want to marry you.

54:03.952 --> 54:06.952
- They will never allow it!
- Ophelia, they will not know.

54:06.954 --> 54:09.287
But all of Denmark
should be yours.

54:09.289 --> 54:11.206
If you were beside me
I would take grass

54:11.208 --> 54:13.419
over Denmark's gilded throne.

54:14.963 --> 54:18.048
When the time comes
we will go away from here.

54:26.266 --> 54:29.599
"My beloved spake,
and said unto me

54:29.601 --> 54:34.771
"rise up, my love,
my fair one, and come away.

54:34.773 --> 54:37.775
"Let him kiss me with the kisses
of his mouth..

54:37.777 --> 54:40.570
"...for his love
is better than wine.

54:40.572 --> 54:44.072
"My beloved is mine
and I am his.

54:44.074 --> 54:45.282
"Behold..

54:45.284 --> 54:47.242
"...thou art fair, my love

54:47.244 --> 54:49.580
"thou hast doves' eyes.

54:50.831 --> 54:52.289
"Behold..

54:52.291 --> 54:54.460
"...thou art fair, my beloved..

54:55.711 --> 54:59.296
"...and also our bed is green.

54:59.298 --> 55:04.385
"For, lo, the winter is past,
and the rain is over and gone.

55:04.387 --> 55:06.514
"Flowers appear on the earth.

55:07.474 --> 55:10.266
"Set me as a seal on your heart

55:10.268 --> 55:13.313
for love is stronger
than death."

56:51.702 --> 56:53.329
Good morning, My Lady.

56:56.458 --> 56:58.249
You're up early.

57:04.340 --> 57:06.259
Or were you up all night?

57:10.764 --> 57:15.641
I'm told you spend your days in
the country with a common boy..

57:15.643 --> 57:17.771
...dressed
like a farmer's daughter.

57:19.271 --> 57:20.648
You don't deny it?

57:24.193 --> 57:28.945
You repay my kindness
by disgracing yourself?

57:28.947 --> 57:31.701
No need to make yourself
lower than you already are.

57:35.954 --> 57:37.537
There you are.

57:37.539 --> 57:38.833
Good morning.

57:44.463 --> 57:47.800
- Do you have what I need?
- I do.

58:01.815 --> 58:03.271
Why do you stare?

58:03.273 --> 58:05.484
You look like you've seen
a ghost.

58:08.112 --> 58:09.778
Leave us, Ophelia.

58:24.628 --> 58:26.172
What keeps you?

58:28.173 --> 58:30.550
Your cloak is torn,
Your Majesty.

58:30.552 --> 58:32.512
Perhaps I could mend it for you?

58:39.853 --> 58:41.354
Are you fast?

58:43.356 --> 58:45.063
You mean my stitches,
Your Majesty?

58:45.065 --> 58:47.860
I think you know what I mean,
Ophelia.

58:50.195 --> 58:55.032
My nephew has been
very strange of late.

58:55.034 --> 58:57.577
He haunts the corridors
at night.

58:57.579 --> 58:59.164
Do you know the cause of that?

59:01.331 --> 59:03.042
Maybe you know the cure.

59:05.253 --> 59:08.965
Perhaps you are the cause
and the cure.

59:12.052 --> 59:16.887
Your father says that my nephew
is in love with you. Is it so?

59:16.889 --> 59:20.057
Hm, my father told me
it could not be so.

59:20.059 --> 59:24.730
- Has he said he loves you?
- Never, Your Majesty.

59:25.815 --> 59:28.231
Has he given you a token
of his love?

59:28.233 --> 59:29.318
Never.

59:37.577 --> 59:39.409
It was all done in innocence,
Your Majesty.

59:39.411 --> 59:41.579
If I know what I know,
they're just children at play!

59:41.581 --> 59:43.914
You said something
quite different before.

59:43.916 --> 59:47.126
I have re-thought myself,
and other things.

59:48.588 --> 59:51.758
I have been worried
about Hamlet's state of mind.

59:56.762 --> 59:58.847
Here is the bait for him.

59:59.974 --> 1:00:01.393
Now, we shall see.

1:00:43.101 --> 1:00:44.019
Nymph!

1:00:45.144 --> 1:00:47.061
Where is your water?

1:00:47.063 --> 1:00:49.021
My Lord, there is much
I need to tell you.

1:00:49.023 --> 1:00:50.981
Wh... what way is that to
greet your husband?

1:00:50.983 --> 1:00:53.693
- None.
- Are you not my wife?

1:00:53.695 --> 1:00:56.322
These games you play, My Lord,
nothing is ever as it seems.

1:00:59.492 --> 1:01:01.745
I have a remembrance
I wish to return to you.

1:01:02.911 --> 1:01:04.954
I gave you nothing. I took.

1:01:04.956 --> 1:01:07.331
Your father was poisoned.
It is true.

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:10.293
I once saw your uncle at a place
where poisons are made.

1:01:10.295 --> 1:01:11.793
I did not recognize him then

1:01:11.795 --> 1:01:14.005
but I saw him again
on the ramparts, disguised

1:01:14.007 --> 1:01:18.008
the very day your father,
the king, was stung.

1:01:20.472 --> 1:01:21.389
So it..

1:01:23.016 --> 1:01:25.349
...so it was no snake

1:01:25.351 --> 1:01:26.351
but Claudius.

1:01:26.353 --> 1:01:27.934
I must repulse your attentions

1:01:27.936 --> 1:01:29.938
My Lord,
they have been forbidden.

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:34.691
Are you sure what you say
is true?

1:01:34.693 --> 1:01:37.654
I found the poison in his cloak
this very morning.

1:01:41.034 --> 1:01:43.450
Then he has stolen
my crown from me.

1:01:43.452 --> 1:01:46.787
Y... y... you said you did not
want the crown.

1:01:46.789 --> 1:01:49.000
You forswore it when you
married me.

1:01:50.376 --> 1:01:52.503
I did not know
it had been stolen.

1:01:58.385 --> 1:02:00.133
Cry out as if I frighten you.

1:02:00.135 --> 1:02:03.637
- God help him, merciful Lord!
- They say I am mad!

1:02:03.639 --> 1:02:05.514
Mad with love, they say, of me.

1:02:05.516 --> 1:02:08.059
Then I will be mad!

1:02:08.061 --> 1:02:09.559
And they will not see me coming.

1:02:09.561 --> 1:02:10.644
I don't understand your meaning.

1:02:10.646 --> 1:02:12.398
You should not know what I mean.

1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:15.777
Remain innocent as snow.

1:02:18.153 --> 1:02:19.322
Cry out.

1:02:21.449 --> 1:02:22.575
Cry out.

1:02:24.119 --> 1:02:25.327
God help you, sir.

1:02:29.748 --> 1:02:31.708
The danger for you
is very great.

1:02:31.710 --> 1:02:34.251
We must get you away from here.

1:02:34.253 --> 1:02:35.878
There is a convent in
St. Emilion

1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:38.213
where my mother lived as a girl.

1:02:38.215 --> 1:02:39.548
You will be safe among the nuns.

1:02:39.550 --> 1:02:42.011
- Hamlet, you cannot do this!
- Go to the nunnery!

1:02:46.557 --> 1:02:47.809
Go!

1:02:55.065 --> 1:02:56.650
He seems..

1:02:57.860 --> 1:02:58.902
...mad.

1:03:01.489 --> 1:03:03.949
I think your daughter
is dangerous.

1:03:06.702 --> 1:03:09.077
She should be married

1:03:09.079 --> 1:03:11.040
as soon as possible.

1:03:13.626 --> 1:03:15.545
I know a guard
who will do my will.

1:03:24.804 --> 1:03:26.470
Greetings, Lord Hamlet.

1:03:28.557 --> 1:03:30.307
Who are you greeting, my love?

1:03:30.309 --> 1:03:32.142
Lord Hamlet!

1:03:32.144 --> 1:03:34.019
- Please, come in!
- Hey!

1:03:34.021 --> 1:03:35.104
Everyone, come in.

1:03:44.990 --> 1:03:46.657
This will settle it, Horatio.

1:03:46.659 --> 1:03:48.284
Adultery, murder, treachery!

1:03:48.286 --> 1:03:51.537
- These are his crimes!
- No! My Lord, you can't go.

1:03:51.539 --> 1:03:52.999
She should not be here!

1:03:54.501 --> 1:03:55.460
There he is!

1:03:56.670 --> 1:03:59.003
He's come to sell me a fish!

1:03:59.005 --> 1:04:01.213
I am no fish-seller, My Lord.

1:04:01.215 --> 1:04:03.175
But what a lovely fish it is.

1:04:04.177 --> 1:04:06.844
Hamlet! Come sit by me.

1:04:06.846 --> 1:04:08.512
What if there was someone
prettier, mother

1:04:08.514 --> 1:04:10.182
who I would rather sit on?

1:04:12.059 --> 1:04:14.769
Do not lie there, My Lord.
Get up.

1:04:14.771 --> 1:04:16.561
Well, where can I lie?

1:04:16.563 --> 1:04:17.771
Can I lie in your lap?

1:04:17.773 --> 1:04:19.691
- No, My Lord.
- I mean my head in your lap.

1:04:19.693 --> 1:04:21.483
You are merry, My Lord.

1:04:21.485 --> 1:04:23.695
Married? Indeed!

1:04:23.697 --> 1:04:25.737
You should know!

1:04:25.739 --> 1:04:28.865
My mother was married, and she
was widowed only hours ago.

1:04:28.867 --> 1:04:31.661
Hold your tongue
and master this madness.

1:04:31.663 --> 1:04:33.539
They want me to marry another.

1:04:35.791 --> 1:04:38.043
If you must marry, marry a fool.

1:04:41.380 --> 1:04:43.005
I knew a fool once.

1:04:43.007 --> 1:04:44.298
His name was Yorick.

1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:46.508
He made a fool
of the king's brother.

1:04:46.510 --> 1:04:48.010
I saw him once.

1:04:48.012 --> 1:04:49.220
He made the king laugh.

1:04:49.222 --> 1:04:52.389
And paid with his life
that very same night.

1:04:52.391 --> 1:04:54.476
'Tis a very sad story indeed.

1:04:56.521 --> 1:04:58.440
I know a sadder one, Ophelia.

1:05:02.027 --> 1:05:03.775
It starts now.

1:05:40.398 --> 1:05:42.606
I told you
to get to the nunnery.

1:06:57.891 --> 1:06:58.851
A light.

1:07:00.728 --> 1:07:01.687
A light.

1:07:04.523 --> 1:07:06.773
- Let there be light!
- It is a mere spectacle!

1:07:06.775 --> 1:07:09.026
You end this now,
or I will end it myself!

1:07:09.028 --> 1:07:10.737
You are making us the spectacle!

1:07:11.947 --> 1:07:14.826
You take them all out
and have them hanged!

1:07:15.702 --> 1:07:19.704
I am your king!

1:07:19.706 --> 1:07:21.541
The king knows the play is true.

1:07:22.375 --> 1:07:24.041
Vengeance is mine.

1:07:24.043 --> 1:07:26.043
Swift, now.

1:07:26.045 --> 1:07:27.963
Hamlet! No.

1:07:39.391 --> 1:07:40.726
'Tis treason..

1:07:44.063 --> 1:07:45.815
...to draw on the king.

1:07:58.244 --> 1:08:01.079
Call the guards!

1:08:01.081 --> 1:08:03.081
Take them to the gallows!

1:08:11.215 --> 1:08:13.465
I thought your lover
was too low.

1:08:13.467 --> 1:08:15.717
But I see he's too high.

1:08:15.719 --> 1:08:19.054
You are first among those
who might understand.

1:08:19.056 --> 1:08:21.139
I was a mother to you

1:08:21.141 --> 1:08:23.809
and you turned my son
against me.

1:08:23.811 --> 1:08:25.268
Forgive me.

1:08:25.270 --> 1:08:27.897
My Lady, you raised me.

1:08:28.942 --> 1:08:30.902
I think you protest too much.

1:08:32.278 --> 1:08:34.989
You cannot know what it is
to love a son.

1:08:36.408 --> 1:08:39.452
I know what it is to love yours.

1:08:43.997 --> 1:08:46.083
You stay away from him.

1:08:47.085 --> 1:08:49.003
And stay out of my sight!

1:08:53.048 --> 1:08:54.089
We are ruined!

1:08:55.467 --> 1:08:57.259
The queen has dismissed you

1:08:57.261 --> 1:08:59.803
and I will probably follow.

1:08:59.805 --> 1:09:01.388
If we can still get you married

1:09:01.390 --> 1:09:02.473
you'll be less of a threat.

1:09:02.475 --> 1:09:04.726
- What?
- Tomorrow and not soon enough.

1:09:04.728 --> 1:09:07.227
Please, no. I cannot bear it.

1:09:07.229 --> 1:09:10.690
Our new king is baying
for blood.

1:09:10.692 --> 1:09:13.608
I am just trying to survive.

1:09:13.610 --> 1:09:14.986
Survival isn't enough.

1:09:17.865 --> 1:09:20.116
You are so like your mother.

1:09:20.118 --> 1:09:21.909
No arrangement there.

1:09:21.911 --> 1:09:23.246
You loved her.

1:09:24.747 --> 1:09:26.914
I will speak to the queen.

1:09:26.916 --> 1:09:29.336
And I will beg her forgiveness.

1:09:58.280 --> 1:09:59.198
Father?

1:10:02.368 --> 1:10:04.494
Horatio, you look fraught.

1:10:04.496 --> 1:10:05.872
What are you doing here?

1:10:06.872 --> 1:10:08.373
Is it Hamlet?

1:10:08.375 --> 1:10:09.958
No, Hamlet lives.

1:10:12.671 --> 1:10:14.629
Your father was killed.

1:10:14.631 --> 1:10:17.882
- Not mine. Hamlet's?
- No, yours.

1:10:17.884 --> 1:10:18.801
My Lord Polonius.

1:10:21.554 --> 1:10:22.637
Forgive me!

1:10:22.639 --> 1:10:24.722
Forgive me, Ophelia!

1:10:24.724 --> 1:10:26.723
Hamlet is mad indeed!

1:10:26.725 --> 1:10:28.643
He thought it was his uncle.

1:10:28.645 --> 1:10:31.439
He drew his sword
before I could say..

1:10:33.024 --> 1:10:35.400
...who was hidden.

1:10:35.402 --> 1:10:38.654
It was an accident.
Not Hamlet's fault, but mine.

1:11:16.568 --> 1:11:18.278
Where is Hamlet?

1:11:20.195 --> 1:11:21.280
Gone.

1:11:22.823 --> 1:11:23.907
Gone?

1:11:25.618 --> 1:11:27.617
To England.

1:11:27.619 --> 1:11:29.247
With Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern.

1:11:30.748 --> 1:11:31.875
King's orders.

1:11:33.001 --> 1:11:34.210
For his own safety.

1:11:36.337 --> 1:11:38.965
It's good of the king
to think of his safety.

1:11:41.342 --> 1:11:43.302
To hurt you, Ophelia.

1:11:44.511 --> 1:11:46.305
You cannot imagine his anguish.

1:11:51.644 --> 1:11:55.271
- Where is my father?
- Man the gates!

1:11:55.273 --> 1:11:56.772
Where is he?

1:11:56.774 --> 1:11:58.732
Who murdered my father?

1:11:58.734 --> 1:12:00.651
I will have justice.

1:12:00.653 --> 1:12:02.320
An eye for an eye.

1:12:02.322 --> 1:12:04.863
An eye for an eye!
Who murdered my father?

1:12:04.865 --> 1:12:06.991
Be calm.

1:12:06.993 --> 1:12:09.451
It is right and good to
want to avenge his killing.

1:12:09.453 --> 1:12:12.830
- But he did not die by my hand.
- Then whose?

1:12:12.832 --> 1:12:13.792
Hamlet.

1:12:15.335 --> 1:12:17.168
Then Hamlet will die at my hand.

1:12:17.170 --> 1:12:18.462
No, Laertes.

1:12:19.588 --> 1:12:22.339
It was all a mistake.

1:12:22.341 --> 1:12:24.426
You must think of your
sister now.

1:12:27.471 --> 1:12:30.013
- Take me to her.
- I will send for her.

1:12:30.015 --> 1:12:31.516
- Open the gate!
- Come.

1:12:31.518 --> 1:12:33.228
There is much to tell you.

1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:39.232
Good thing you are
getting married today.

1:12:39.234 --> 1:12:41.528
You're already fat as a cow.

1:12:44.279 --> 1:12:46.488
You're lucky to find a husband
at all with no fortune

1:12:46.490 --> 1:12:49.077
no family and no virtue left.

1:12:53.957 --> 1:12:55.748
I hope you're not still
keeping a candle lit

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.711
for your lover, the prince.

1:12:58.712 --> 1:13:00.505
One candle would not be enough.

1:13:01.672 --> 1:13:04.298
Even if he ceased to be at all?

1:13:04.300 --> 1:13:06.386
If he dies then I die as well.

1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:10.765
You seem alive to me.

1:13:12.725 --> 1:13:13.726
Alive

1:13:14.394 --> 1:13:15.353
but married.

1:13:16.645 --> 1:13:17.646
To Hamlet?

1:13:23.110 --> 1:13:24.487
Then you are a widow.

1:13:27.657 --> 1:13:29.576
Hamlet is dead already.

1:13:31.243 --> 1:13:34.245
My Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
were sent with him.

1:13:34.247 --> 1:13:37.334
They did not like their orders,
but they obeyed the king.

1:13:39.836 --> 1:13:41.878
What did the king
tell them to do?

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:43.504
I will not tell!

1:13:44.506 --> 1:13:46.007
Tell me.

1:13:47.426 --> 1:13:50.553
- Oh! Ah!
- Get her away! She's mad.

1:13:50.555 --> 1:13:52.013
Ah! Ah!

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:56.603
Tell me or I swear..

1:13:59.314 --> 1:14:00.396
The minute the ship left port

1:14:00.398 --> 1:14:02.357
they were to throw him
overboard.

1:14:05.362 --> 1:14:06.945
And they sailed last night.

1:14:45.652 --> 1:14:51.863
♪ Doubt truth to be a liar ♪

1:14:51.865 --> 1:14:57.997
♪ But never doubt I love ♪♪

1:15:02.961 --> 1:15:04.003
Ophelia.

1:15:05.087 --> 1:15:07.006
Hamlet is dead, Horatio.

1:15:07.841 --> 1:15:09.132
Dead?

1:15:09.134 --> 1:15:11.718
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
had orders to betray him

1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:13.260
when the ship sailed.

1:15:13.262 --> 1:15:14.803
The harbor is becalmed.

1:15:14.805 --> 1:15:16.223
The ship still rests there.

1:15:17.141 --> 1:15:18.184
It has not left.

1:15:24.690 --> 1:15:27.442
Then he lives?
Horatio, we can still save him.

1:15:27.444 --> 1:15:28.361
- I...
- Horatio.

1:15:30.529 --> 1:15:32.530
The king requires you.

1:15:32.532 --> 1:15:33.906
Have you seen my bride, Ophelia?

1:15:33.908 --> 1:15:35.157
No. Not of late.

1:15:35.159 --> 1:15:36.241
The whole castle
searches for her.

1:15:36.243 --> 1:15:37.701
The king bay them
lock the gates.

1:15:37.703 --> 1:15:39.579
The last of I saw of her,
she was unwell.

1:15:39.581 --> 1:15:41.705
The king has ordered that
no one leave or enter.

1:15:59.016 --> 1:16:01.851
You see, the queen thinks that
you've lost your wits

1:16:01.853 --> 1:16:03.727
but I think your wits
are the one thing

1:16:03.729 --> 1:16:06.063
you still have about you.

1:16:06.065 --> 1:16:07.065
No!

1:16:08.109 --> 1:16:10.442
No-one is going to miss you.

1:16:10.444 --> 1:16:14.073
No father, no brother,
no husband.

1:16:15.033 --> 1:16:17.032
Yes.

1:16:17.034 --> 1:16:18.910
We found an old village priest

1:16:18.912 --> 1:16:21.079
who, with a little persuasion

1:16:21.081 --> 1:16:23.748
had a very strange tale to tell.

1:16:23.750 --> 1:16:26.461
He says that you have a husband.

1:16:29.005 --> 1:16:32.092
And that he himself
made you a wife.

1:16:35.761 --> 1:16:38.470
Now, if you were my child..

1:16:38.472 --> 1:16:41.434
Your only child died
before he drew breath.

1:16:42.935 --> 1:16:44.144
Yes, a son.

1:16:45.563 --> 1:16:48.650
They called his mother a witch
and made to burn her.

1:16:50.902 --> 1:16:52.820
But you know so already.

1:16:54.113 --> 1:16:56.947
It was you that
cried witchcraft.

1:16:56.949 --> 1:16:59.157
It was you that turned
the village against the woman

1:16:59.159 --> 1:17:00.412
who loved you.

1:17:03.122 --> 1:17:04.790
My Lord, we heard a cry.

1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:16.718
Your bride is

1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.177
more than a handful.

1:17:18.179 --> 1:17:20.138
Our wedding is today,
Your Majesty.

1:17:20.140 --> 1:17:23.518
You will not want to
marry a traitor.

1:17:30.774 --> 1:17:31.817
Leave us.

1:17:42.328 --> 1:17:44.495
You dare not harm me.

1:17:44.497 --> 1:17:47.080
The king suspects
you of treason.

1:17:47.082 --> 1:17:49.168
Punishment for treason
is well known.

1:17:50.377 --> 1:17:51.503
It is death.

1:17:52.713 --> 1:17:53.881
What a waste.

1:17:55.632 --> 1:17:58.259
Perhaps you could take me to
the woods and leave me there.

1:17:58.261 --> 1:18:00.013
The king would never know.

1:18:32.252 --> 1:18:34.380
He was a good man, your father.

1:18:36.216 --> 1:18:38.134
But you are twice him, I think.

1:19:10.166 --> 1:19:12.085
Sing with me, Laertes.

1:19:19.091 --> 1:19:20.676
My sweet sister, come.

1:19:21.344 --> 1:19:23.593
Sit. Be still.

1:19:37.902 --> 1:19:38.819
Ooh!

1:19:51.082 --> 1:19:54.334
Here's rosemary,
for remembrance.

1:19:54.336 --> 1:19:55.962
I hope you remember.

1:19:58.131 --> 1:20:00.300
Pansies for your thoughts.

1:20:02.969 --> 1:20:06.303
Rue... for your regrets

1:20:06.305 --> 1:20:08.138
and your sisters.

1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:10.018
And some for me and mine.

1:20:12.061 --> 1:20:14.980
Daisies. The day's eye.

1:20:15.648 --> 1:20:17.108
All seeing.

1:20:17.984 --> 1:20:19.611
Someone sees you.

1:20:26.658 --> 1:20:27.825
I'd give you some violets

1:20:27.827 --> 1:20:30.497
but they all withered
when my father died.

1:20:32.957 --> 1:20:35.165
Faithful Horatio,
will you visit my grave?

1:20:35.167 --> 1:20:38.460
- Ophelia.
- Visit me before I am cold.

1:20:43.134 --> 1:20:44.549
Be sure to dig me up

1:20:44.551 --> 1:20:47.680
and I promise you will get
an excellent anatomy lesson.

1:20:58.983 --> 1:21:00.235
Here's fennel..

1:21:01.235 --> 1:21:02.362
...for you.

1:21:05.948 --> 1:21:07.533
And columbines..

1:21:08.827 --> 1:21:10.410
...for flattery.

1:21:10.412 --> 1:21:12.914
You'll miss it now
my father's gone.

- Let her be!

1:21:31.807 --> 1:21:34.058
The poor thing has gone mad.

1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:35.353
Let her be!

1:21:42.068 --> 1:21:44.904
Get her out of my sight.

1:21:50.743 --> 1:21:52.994
- You follow her.
- Yes, Sire.

1:22:02.505 --> 1:22:03.422
Sit.

1:22:03.922 --> 1:22:04.965
Eat.

1:22:06.551 --> 1:22:09.137

1:24:41.956 --> 1:24:43.248
Where is Hamlet?

1:24:44.458 --> 1:24:46.126
I dug you up as you commanded.

1:24:51.925 --> 1:24:54.511
I took a venom that
mimics death but mocks it.

1:25:01.725 --> 1:25:02.933
Where is Hamlet?

1:25:02.935 --> 1:25:04.936
Swiftly,
to his ship before it sails.

1:25:04.938 --> 1:25:06.605
I'm not well, Horatio.

1:25:12.612 --> 1:25:14.070
What is that?

1:25:21.787 --> 1:25:23.204
There are scouts about.

1:25:25.792 --> 1:25:28.166
It's our enemies from Norway.

1:25:28.168 --> 1:25:30.046
They're advancing
on the castle.

1:25:31.797 --> 1:25:33.964
You must warn the court.

1:25:33.966 --> 1:25:35.426
I will not leave you.

1:25:36.594 --> 1:25:38.885
You must warn them, Horatio.

1:25:38.887 --> 1:25:40.263
Go.

1:25:40.265 --> 1:25:41.725
I will go on alone.

1:25:43.643 --> 1:25:44.601
Ophelia..

1:25:45.603 --> 1:25:46.645
...farewell.

1:26:03.246 --> 1:26:05.580
I am dying.
Give me the remedy.

1:26:07.167 --> 1:26:10.253
- You took the venom?
- Too much, I fear. Please.

1:26:14.090 --> 1:26:15.923
The wood is full of soldiers.

1:26:15.925 --> 1:26:17.549
Soldiers?

1:26:17.551 --> 1:26:19.679
Worse still. Drink.

1:26:26.519 --> 1:26:27.896
Now be gone.

1:26:31.024 --> 1:26:33.109
I have kept your secret.

1:26:35.028 --> 1:26:36.654
Claudius came to you.

1:26:37.529 --> 1:26:40.157
You helped him murder a king.

1:26:42.034 --> 1:26:43.494
He helped himself.

1:26:44.996 --> 1:26:46.914
I could never deny him.

1:26:47.916 --> 1:26:50.666
Why should I?
I didn't care.

1:26:50.668 --> 1:26:52.585
Let them do to each other
whatever they want to

1:26:52.587 --> 1:26:54.211
up on their hill.

1:26:54.213 --> 1:26:55.340
Even now.

1:26:56.548 --> 1:26:59.386
Even that you could not
deny him?

1:27:01.805 --> 1:27:04.891
I did love him... once.

1:27:10.020 --> 1:27:11.563
And he did love me.

1:27:13.983 --> 1:27:16.903
It was he who cried witchcraft
when your baby died.

1:27:18.195 --> 1:27:21.155
I have witnessed
his confession.

1:27:21.157 --> 1:27:24.701
It was he who set
the mob upon you.

1:27:24.703 --> 1:27:28.454
- He would have let you burn.
- No.

1:27:28.456 --> 1:27:29.914
No, not him.

1:27:29.916 --> 1:27:31.583
He loves power.

1:27:32.793 --> 1:27:34.921
That is all he loves.

1:27:36.672 --> 1:27:37.798
He mocked me.

1:27:42.302 --> 1:27:43.555
He shall burn.

1:27:55.608 --> 1:27:56.693
Hold these.

1:27:58.444 --> 1:28:01.864
You are in more trouble
than I thought.

1:28:21.259 --> 1:28:23.092
Halt right there.

1:28:23.094 --> 1:28:24.011
Who are you?

1:28:26.805 --> 1:28:27.973
A friend.

1:29:01.716 --> 1:29:03.218
Have mercy, spirit.

1:29:05.470 --> 1:29:07.055
God forgive me, Ophelia.

1:29:11.016 --> 1:29:14.393
It is not my blood
you have on your hands.

1:29:14.395 --> 1:29:17.729
I did not think Claudius
meant to kill him.

1:29:17.731 --> 1:29:19.359
You gave him reason.

1:29:22.153 --> 1:29:23.613
I'd lost my own.

1:29:24.738 --> 1:29:27.533
He brought your sister to ruin.

1:29:29.284 --> 1:29:30.703
Claudius?

1:29:32.579 --> 1:29:34.791
You never knew he was
the man she loved?

1:29:37.002 --> 1:29:39.421
I thought any man but him.

1:29:41.881 --> 1:29:43.675
Oh, my sister!

1:29:52.266 --> 1:29:53.893
Absolve me.

1:30:02.735 --> 1:30:04.194
Take my hand.

1:30:10.452 --> 1:30:12.410
You are solid flesh.

1:30:12.412 --> 1:30:15.079
And yet I saw my son
leap into your grave.

1:30:15.081 --> 1:30:16.414
Hamlet?

1:30:16.416 --> 1:30:18.458
He left the ship when word
reached him you had died.

1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:20.837
- I must return to Elsinore.
- No, too late.

1:30:22.338 --> 1:30:25.298
Laertes challenged Hamlet in the
matter of your father's death.

1:30:25.300 --> 1:30:28.427
- They are set to fight.
- No.

1:30:30.805 --> 1:30:33.764
Where is my sister?
She will have counsel.

1:30:33.766 --> 1:30:35.391
I cannot wait.

1:30:35.393 --> 1:30:36.768
Hamlet will heed only me.

1:30:36.770 --> 1:30:38.271
Claudius will have you killed.

1:30:40.148 --> 1:30:41.938
But I'm already dead.

1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:21.562
Is all prepared?

1:31:21.564 --> 1:31:23.563
I have anointed your sword.

1:31:23.565 --> 1:31:25.484
Just a touch will do.

1:31:26.819 --> 1:31:28.402
Where is Hamlet?

1:31:28.404 --> 1:31:31.363
- Boy, what's your name?
- Osric, Sire.

1:31:31.365 --> 1:31:34.575
Go fetch Hamlet, bid him come
and start the fight.

1:31:34.577 --> 1:31:35.829
As you wish, Your Majesty.

1:31:37.162 --> 1:31:38.997
You have nothing to fear.

1:31:49.091 --> 1:31:50.676
Shall we wager?

1:31:51.761 --> 1:31:53.930
I have little appetite
for games.

1:31:56.265 --> 1:31:59.308
Then I'll take Laertes,
by your leave.

1:31:59.310 --> 1:32:02.022
Hamlet is far the better
swordsman.

1:32:04.149 --> 1:32:06.568
The better man
does not always win.

1:32:17.619 --> 1:32:20.787
There are two sides
struggling in you.

1:32:20.789 --> 1:32:24.502
One is baser, one better.

1:32:31.885 --> 1:32:33.425
Ophelia?

1:32:33.427 --> 1:32:34.845
In the flesh.

1:32:37.015 --> 1:32:39.434
- You live?
- My love.

1:32:46.858 --> 1:32:49.901
You're..
You are like a dream I had.

1:32:49.903 --> 1:32:51.945
And when I woke, it was true.

1:32:56.784 --> 1:32:58.785
You must understand

1:32:58.787 --> 1:33:00.413
I seek not this battle.

1:33:01.247 --> 1:33:02.374
Laertes does.

1:33:03.541 --> 1:33:05.960
And has your own
revenge grown cold?

1:33:07.753 --> 1:33:08.880
No.

1:33:10.673 --> 1:33:13.926
- It burns in me still.
- I feared as much.

1:33:14.927 --> 1:33:16.720
Hamlet, we can escape now.

1:33:17.764 --> 1:33:19.930
We will flee to the convent.

1:33:19.932 --> 1:33:22.517
Not every story must
end with a battle.

1:33:22.519 --> 1:33:23.770
Where are you, Hamlet?

1:33:24.688 --> 1:33:25.771
Come.

1:33:26.523 --> 1:33:27.897
I will.

1:33:27.899 --> 1:33:29.818
- I will.
- Now.

1:33:31.152 --> 1:33:33.777
I swore vengeance.

1:33:33.779 --> 1:33:37.032
You swore to love me
and be mine.

1:33:38.368 --> 1:33:39.452
I am yours.

1:33:41.371 --> 1:33:42.372
Ophelia.

1:33:43.581 --> 1:33:45.831
I will follow you, Ophelia.

1:33:45.833 --> 1:33:46.917
Hamlet!

1:34:03.643 --> 1:34:04.853
Goodbye, my love.

1:34:10.442 --> 1:34:11.566
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1:34:11.568 --> 1:34:12.858
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1:34:12.860 --> 1:34:13.860
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1:34:13.862 --> 1:34:15.486
- Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

1:34:15.488 --> 1:34:16.486
Let him through, My Lord.

a kingdom lost.

to hope..

1:39:19.292 --> 1:39:21.920
...that one day
I would tell my own story.
