Allie, Cry of the Cat is one of the
most successful books ever written.

[ Grunts, Groans ]

00:57.067 --> 00:58.387
Oh. Oh, no!

01:01.100 --> 01:04.099
Hi. Uh, listen.

01:04.099 --> 01:06.100
Something awful just happened.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.900
Do you-- I mean,
did you have a brown cat?

01:11.400 --> 01:13.400
- Rip?
- There was an accident.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.433
I think I ran over him.

01:16.433 --> 01:19.867
Rip's not like ordinary cats.

01:20.367 --> 01:23.200
[ Loud Thunderclaps ]

01:23.700 --> 01:26.167
The cabinet.
Go for the cabinet.

Honey, are you all right?

01:38.033 --> 01:41.433
[ Moans ]
Rip. Rip's under there.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.333
But it was right there.
I saw it!

01:50.333 --> 01:52.867
What am I going to do?

01:53.867 --> 01:57.300
- [ Ripping ]
- [ Screams ]

02:03.067 --> 02:03.817
Oh.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.900
- What is she doing?
- [ Hisses ]

02:14.367 --> 02:16.367

Allison, stop!

- Allison?
- Get me an ambulance now!

02:33.633 --> 02:36.633

02:47.867 --> 02:50.300
What's happening to her?

02:54.700 --> 02:56.600
What's the matter?

02:56.600 --> 02:59.600
Why is everybody looking at me?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.800
[ Scoffs ]

03:06.600 --> 03:11.233
- How did I get down here?
- [ Siren Wailing ]

03:14.900 --> 03:18.233
Well, I can't figure this out.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.167
According to every law
of physical science,

03:20.167 --> 03:21.500
you should have
at least ten broken bones,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.767
but there's nothing
wrong with you.

03:23.767 --> 03:26.200
There's no fractures.
There's no pulled tendons.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.933
- I can't even find a bruise.
- That's good, right?

03:28.933 --> 03:31.367
So I can get out of here?
Ow!

03:31.367 --> 03:34.367
- What was that for?
- Shh.

03:34.367 --> 03:37.800
- It's just a little something to help you sleep.
- No. I don't wanna sleep.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.367
Come on, Al.
You need your rest.

03:40.367 --> 03:43.367
No. You don't understand.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.100
[ Marta ]
Don't you worry, honey.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.600
I called your mother at the spa,

03:46.600 --> 03:50.067
and she'll be here just as soon
as that mud pack slides off.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.100
But I can't sleep.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.533
Rip will get me.

03:54.533 --> 03:58.867
Please! Don't let him...

03:58.867 --> 03:59.707
get me.

04:01.733 --> 04:05.700
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Hello? Finally.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.633

05:02.067 --> 05:05.067
- Got ya!
- [ Whining ]

05:20.267 --> 05:23.267
It was just a dream.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.767
Just a bad dream.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.433
[ Distant Snarling ]

05:38.933 --> 05:41.367
Thank you, nurse.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.867
This is impossible.

05:46.367 --> 05:50.367
Look at this. There's gotta be
some kind of a mistake here.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.867
Get me the lab.

05:58.867 --> 06:02.867
[ Woman On PA ] Dr. Morris to

[ Sneezing ]

06:11.367 --> 06:14.367
- Are you all right, nurse?
- Yes.

06:14.367 --> 06:17.867
Yes. It's just funny.

06:18.367 --> 06:22.367
The only thing
I'm allergic to is cat hair.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.867
Alice, this is Dr. McDermid
up in pediatrics.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.867
I just want to check
on something strange here.

06:26.867 --> 06:29.367
I just got the blood tests back
on an Allison Rogers,

06:29.367 --> 06:32.367
and I think there must be
some kind of a mistake.

06:32.367 --> 06:34.867
- [ Woman ] What kind of mistake?
- The percentages are all wrong.

06:34.867 --> 06:36.367
From what I can tell,
you tested the wrong blood.

06:36.867 --> 06:39.367
- [ Alice ] I don't think so.
No, I'm sure you're competent, Alice.

06:39.367 --> 06:43.367
It's just that, well,
this looks like cat blood.

06:43.367 --> 06:46.867
Do me a favor and check it out
again for me, will ya?

06:46.867 --> 06:50.033
Okay, Doctor.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.267
Crystal?
Are you in there?

06:59.267 --> 07:02.767
I need to talk to you.
Crystal.

07:02.767 --> 07:07.267
[ Cat Howling ]

07:11.733 --> 07:13.233
Crystal?

07:14.233 --> 07:16.733
I know you're in here someplace.

07:16.733 --> 07:19.733
I'm not leaving until I talk to you.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.567
"Cats provide clue to flu"?

07:47.367 --> 07:49.833
"Animal testing banned at university."

07:50.833 --> 07:52.833
- I knew you'd come back.
- [ Gasps ]

07:52.833 --> 07:54.300
What's going on, Crystal?

07:54.800 --> 07:59.267
- What's happening to me?
- He scratched you, didn't he?

08:00.267 --> 08:03.267
How did you know that?

08:03.267 --> 08:06.267
It's... what he does.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.267
This is your mother, isn't it?

08:08.267 --> 08:12.267
She's a scientist. Let me talk to her.
She must know what's going on.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.767
No.
You can't talk to her.

08:15.767 --> 08:18.767
My mom doesn't like
to talk to people.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.267
Well, then you ask her for me.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.267
Ask her how Rip
can get hit by a bike,

08:25.767 --> 08:28.267
have a cupboard dropped on him,
even fall out a window...

08:28.267 --> 08:30.767
and still keep coming back.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.767
That's three.

08:32.767 --> 08:35.267
- Three what?
- Three times.

08:35.267 --> 08:38.866
- That means he's used up eight lives.
- What are you talking about?

08:38.866 --> 08:41.866
You have to be careful.
Stay away from him.

08:41.866 --> 08:44.867
And whatever you do,
don't let him scratch you again.

08:44.867 --> 08:47.800
Why?
What's he doing to me?

08:47.800 --> 08:50.767
I told you--
Rip isn't an ordinary cat.

08:50.767 --> 08:54.767
He's desperate now, Allison.
He only has one life left.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.467
And he won't stop until he has yours.

08:59.867 --> 09:03.367
Crystal, this is crazy.
Why does this cat want me?

09:03.367 --> 09:06.867
Not you, Allison.
He wants your life force.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.867
Rip isn't an ordinary cat,

09:09.367 --> 09:12.867
but he still had nine lives,
and now he's almost run out of them,

09:13.367 --> 09:16.367
so he's gotta find some way
to get 'em back.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.867
Every time he scratches you,
a bit of your life goes into him,

09:19.867 --> 09:22.367
and a bit of him goes into you.

09:22.867 --> 09:25.867
Is that why I'm eating raw fish?

09:26.367 --> 09:29.367
And the more he scratches you,
the worse it'll get.

09:30.867 --> 09:33.367
- But how do I stop him?
- I don't know.

09:33.867 --> 09:37.867
Mom and I tried,
but he just kept coming back.

09:37.867 --> 09:40.367
You said he was desperate.

09:40.867 --> 09:42.867
That means I have to get him...

09:43.367 --> 09:45.367
before he gets me.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.867
He must have a hiding place.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.367
Somewhere he goes between lives.

09:50.367 --> 09:52.367
Yeah, but that could be anywhere.

09:52.367 --> 09:55.800
Could be, but it isn't.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.800
He goes someplace
he remembers from his first life.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.600
The first time he died--
where did you bury him?

10:01.600 --> 10:04.033
Up on Forta Hill.
The pet graveyard.

10:04.033 --> 10:06.033
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

10:06.500 --> 10:09.867
- Do you know that place?
- We're shooting there... tonight.

10:09.867 --> 10:12.867
[ Woman ]
Cue the smoke!

10:13.367 --> 10:16.367
It's up here. Come on.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.367
Are you sure about this?

10:18.867 --> 10:21.833
It's the only way
we can stop the monster.

10:21.833 --> 10:24.333
We have to dig up his coffin
and destroy his bones.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.833
But what happens
if he comes back before we, uh--

10:28.833 --> 10:32.267
[ Nervous Chuckle ]
Well, before we can--

10:32.267 --> 10:34.733
You mean,
before we can find his grave?

10:34.733 --> 10:38.100
Yeah! Before we can find his--
Whoa!

10:38.100 --> 10:41.733
- [ Larry ] Cut!
- [ Woman ] That's a cut.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.233
Enough with the smoke.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.200
- Kill the smoke.
- Kill the smoke.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.633
Stupid thing.

10:49.067 --> 10:53.067
Larry, how am I supposed to act when
you want me to walk at the same time?

10:53.067 --> 10:56.067
Don't worry, darling.
You're doing a fabulous job.

10:56.067 --> 10:59.067
Much better than that last girl--
Andrea.

10:59.067 --> 11:00.667
Her name was Allison, Larry.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.767
Let's not worry about that
right now.

11:03.767 --> 11:06.200
[ Larry Sighs ]

11:06.200 --> 11:08.700
I think we've got everything here.
Moving on!

11:09.200 --> 11:10.700
Moving on!

11:11.200 --> 11:14.600
[ Woman ] Okay, people.
We're setting up on the hill. Let's go!

11:23.933 --> 11:28.900
Okay. Now, in this scene,
we finally dig up Fluffy.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.800
- Where's Fluffy's gravestone?
- Right here, Larry.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.167
What's it doing over there?
It's too far away.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.667
I thought I told you people
I wanted it somewhere around here.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.133
Just tell us where you want it,
Larry.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.133
I'm telling you.
Right here!

11:45.033 --> 11:47.500
Okay, people. Let's do it!

11:48.500 --> 11:49.933
Let's do it!

11:49.933 --> 11:52.900
[ Woman On Bullhorn ]
Number one, please.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.400
[ Woman, Indistinct ]

11:58.833 --> 12:00.800
We're rolling.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.733
And--

12:03.733 --> 12:07.167
- Cut! Cut, cut!
- Who said cut? Who said cut on my set?

12:07.167 --> 12:09.133
Larry,
you've gotta stop shooting here.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.633
Let me guess.
Or the evil cat spirit will come back...

12:12.133 --> 12:13.633
And have us all for dinner?

12:13.633 --> 12:17.567
- [ All Laughing ]
- Something like that, yeah.

12:17.567 --> 12:19.467
I'll tell you what.

12:19.467 --> 12:22.400
Why don't you go stand over there
and watch the show?

12:22.400 --> 12:26.333
But, Larry, you don't understand!
Rip will come back again!

12:26.333 --> 12:28.333

12:28.333 --> 12:30.800
- Roll it!
- We're rolling.

12:32.267 --> 12:34.767
- [ Man ] Speed.
- Action!

12:41.967 --> 12:45.167
How much further?

12:46.600 --> 12:50.167
Keep digging.
It's gotta be down here somewhere.

12:55.967 --> 13:00.100
- [ Thud ]
- Hey. I got it.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.800
Oh!
[ Giggling ]

13:07.467 --> 13:09.833
- Is this it?
- Yup.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.800
- [ Laughing ]
- This is Fluffy.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.267
Where are the bones?
Cut!

13:21.267 --> 13:24.100
- Cut! Print.
- There were supposed to be bones in there!

13:24.100 --> 13:27.800
You changed the gravestones,
Larry. That's not our coffin.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.133
What?
So whose is it?

13:31.500 --> 13:35.567
- [ Rumbling ]
- [ Man ] Hey, what's that?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.033
Oh, I am so out of here!

13:44.433 --> 13:46.900
[ Rumbling Stops ]

13:49.400 --> 13:51.833
- Larry!
- Banacek!

13:51.833 --> 13:54.600
- Not me, Larry.
- What the heck was that?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.067
It was Rip.

13:57.067 --> 14:00.500
- Oh, please!
- I don't get paid enough for this.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.467
- [ Yells ]
- [ Screaming ]

14:04.467 --> 14:07.900
[ Woman ]
Are you okay? Karen, grab that.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.333
Keep rolling!

14:12.300 --> 14:15.100
[ Screaming Continues ]

14:16.033 --> 14:17.967
Come on!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
Come on!

14:32.533 --> 14:34.500
- It's getting closer.
- Allison!

14:35.000 --> 14:36.467
You'll be safe in here.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.967
- Who's that?
- A friend.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.967
Come on.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.200
I gotta call my agent.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.200
- This way. Mom will help you.
- "Mom"?

14:47.700 --> 14:51.167
- She's a scientist.
- Yeah. Of course she is.

14:52.667 --> 14:56.167
Mom? She's here.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.633
Allison's here.

14:58.633 --> 15:02.000
And she brought a friend.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
We need your help.
It's about Rip.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.433
[ Woman ]
I know all about Rip.

15:10.933 --> 15:15.300
- [ Both Gasping ]
- You might say we're old friends.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.300
- Oh, man.
- They're here for you, Rip.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.267
- No!
- You ran over him, Allison.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.200
You owe him.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.133
Why?
Why are you doing this?

15:24.633 --> 15:27.067
We didn't mean to hurt anyone.

15:27.567 --> 15:30.567
I was trying to find a cure
for a deadly virus,

15:30.567 --> 15:33.067
and since the cat's immune system
is so close to human,

15:33.567 --> 15:36.533
they were my subjects.

15:36.533 --> 15:40.033
But all the experiments failed.

15:40.533 --> 15:43.033
All except Rip.

15:43.533 --> 15:47.400
He turned into some
strange kind of monster.

15:47.900 --> 15:51.400
He's not even
really a cat anymore,

15:51.900 --> 15:54.700
but he kept coming back anyway.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.567
- And scratching you.
- Yes.

15:58.033 --> 16:00.433
I gave him my life,
and with each scratch,

16:00.933 --> 16:02.900
I became a little more like him.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.400
He wanted Crystal,

16:06.833 --> 16:09.733
but I wouldn't allow it.

16:10.233 --> 16:12.700
I gave up my life for her.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.700
Now you don't have any left,
and that's why you need us.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.600
Man, my agent is never
gonna go for this.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.433
They're ready for you, Rip.
They're all yours.

16:22.933 --> 16:25.800
- No! You can't do this!
- It doesn't hurt.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.800
These scratches are deep,
but they don't bleed.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.800
- [ Growling ]
- And we end up looking like you?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.100
It's not so bad.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.933
You get used to it after a while.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.867
I'm sorry.

16:47.367 --> 16:50.300
I'm so sorry.

16:52.933 --> 16:55.433
Oh, man!

16:56.933 --> 17:01.367
- Now what?
- There's gotta be some way out of this.

17:02.867 --> 17:05.367
Now I know how mice feel.

17:06.367 --> 17:09.367
Mice. Come on.

17:09.867 --> 17:12.367
What?

17:13.867 --> 17:17.833
- Distract him. Do something.
- Like what?

17:17.833 --> 17:21.333
You're an actor.
Improvise.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.300
Rip!

17:25.800 --> 17:27.300
[ Growling ]

17:27.800 --> 17:30.300
[ Snarling ]

17:31.300 --> 17:34.300
Hey, Rip!

17:34.300 --> 17:37.233
So, you, uh, like Shakespeare?

17:37.233 --> 17:38.733
[ Roars ]

17:39.233 --> 17:42.233
To be or not to be?

17:42.733 --> 17:44.700
That is the question.

17:44.700 --> 17:48.667
That is the question!

17:50.667 --> 17:53.133
The question.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Like--

18:00.500 --> 18:04.933
Hey, Rip.
Catch the mouse.

18:04.933 --> 18:08.333
[ Snarling ]

18:10.200 --> 18:12.167
[ Louder Snarling ]

18:15.167 --> 18:17.667
[ Roaring ]

18:22.533 --> 18:25.033
[ Gasps ]
Allison!

18:25.033 --> 18:26.867
Rip! Let him go!

18:26.867 --> 18:28.800
[ Screeching ]

18:28.800 --> 18:31.800
It's the chemicals.
He swallowed the mouse.

18:35.333 --> 18:38.667
Well, he's gonna blow.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.100
[ Explosion ]

18:50.500 --> 18:52.500
[ Sighs ]
Your leg.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.467
It's no problem.

19:01.967 --> 19:04.967
Hey!
What are you doing?

19:04.967 --> 19:07.967
I just want to make sure.

19:19.433 --> 19:22.433
[ Coughing ]

19:22.933 --> 19:25.433
[ Coughing ]

19:35.667 --> 19:38.167
It's over.

19:38.167 --> 19:40.167
It's really over.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.500
- Thank you.
- [ Chuckles ]

19:54.000 --> 19:55.900
Thank you both.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.867
Well--
[ Chuckles ]

20:02.867 --> 20:06.367
[ Crystal's Mom ]
Well, bravo! Bravo.

20:06.367 --> 20:10.867
That was totally great,
and a perfect way to break in our new TV.

20:10.867 --> 20:13.333
Hey, who wants more popcorn?

20:13.333 --> 20:15.333
- Sounds good to me.
- Sure.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.800
I'll help you.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.800
How 'bout some more soda?

20:20.300 --> 20:22.300
Not only are they good actors,
they're excellent hosts.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.800
At your service.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.167
You know, the only thing
I didn't like about that movie--

20:30.167 --> 20:34.400
- [ Hissing ]
- It didn't have a twist ending.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
- I hate that.
- Yeah.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.367
Me too.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.333
[ Gasps ]

20:46.333 --> 20:50.967
I love a good... twist ending.
