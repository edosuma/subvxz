[vehicle approaching]

[door closes]

01:17.680 --> 01:21.148
Hey, Gossamer,
I need your help.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.718
Get that down for me.

01:25.620 --> 01:27.087
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:27.089 --> 01:29.123
I think there's something
wrong with this ball.

01:29.125 --> 01:32.459
You should probably stick around
in case that happens again.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.028
Oh, that sounds fun.

01:34.030 --> 01:36.764
But I have to go home
and make posters.

01:36.766 --> 01:40.200
That's your homework?
Making posters? Heh!

01:40.202 --> 01:44.405
Kids have it
too easy these days.

01:45.707 --> 01:49.610
No, it's not homework.
I'm running for class president.

01:49.612 --> 01:51.912
Class president?
You're not popular.

01:51.914 --> 01:54.615
Yeah, I know.
But I have a lot of good ideas.

01:54.617 --> 01:56.483
Huh, everyone has good ideas.

01:56.485 --> 01:58.185
Just this morning,
I put root beer

01:58.187 --> 02:01.522
In my cereal instead of milk.

02:03.391 --> 02:07.795
So what are you saying?
You don't think I can win?

02:07.797 --> 02:09.729
Maybe. But it won't be easy.

02:09.732 --> 02:12.533
You'll need to run a smart,
mistake-free campaign

02:12.535 --> 02:16.470
That stays on message,
and steadily gains momentum

02:16.472 --> 02:18.772
Until it peaks the day
of the election.

02:18.774 --> 02:21.375
Wow. How do you know
so much about it?

02:21.377 --> 02:23.310
I was elected
to the city council.

02:23.312 --> 02:25.279
You're on the city council?!

02:25.281 --> 02:26.914
Not anymore.
It was too boring.

02:26.916 --> 02:29.316
So I faked my own death
to get off of it.

02:29.318 --> 02:33.253
The point is, I know
how to win an election.

02:34.556 --> 02:37.458
Could you help me
win an election?

02:37.460 --> 02:41.962
Hmm. A big,
orange, hairy nerd.

02:41.964 --> 02:43.864
Yeah, I can work with that.

02:43.866 --> 02:46.867
Kid, with me
as your campaign manager,

02:46.869 --> 02:51.972
This election will be
a slam... Dunk!

02:51.974 --> 02:55.109
[crash]

02:55.111 --> 02:55.776
Huh?

02:55.778 --> 02:59.413
There's something really
wrong with that ball.

02:59.415 --> 03:01.915
[groans]

03:04.786 --> 03:05.886
What do you think?

03:05.888 --> 03:09.890
"Gossamer is Awesomer."
that's not a real word.

03:10.125 --> 03:13.394
I know, but it's his name,
and we can't change it.

03:13.396 --> 03:15.095
[doorbell rings]

03:15.097 --> 03:16.864
Or can we?

03:16.866 --> 03:20.000
I don't know
what that kid sees in you.

03:20.002 --> 03:21.068
Porky?

03:21.070 --> 03:22.136
[stammering] Do you mind

03:22.138 --> 03:25.038
If I stay with you guys
for a while?

03:25.040 --> 03:27.908
You sold your house?

03:27.910 --> 03:30.511
I had to. I couldn't afford it.

03:30.513 --> 03:32.780
I haven't had a catering job
in almost a year.

03:32.782 --> 03:36.116
Well, why didn't you tell us?
We would have helped you out.

03:36.118 --> 03:38.786
No, no, no.
It wouldn't have felt right

03:38.788 --> 03:40.087
Taking money from a friend.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.656
Why? Who else are you going
to take money from?

03:42.658 --> 03:43.524
Strangers?

03:43.526 --> 03:45.325
That's thievery, Porky.

03:45.327 --> 03:46.627
For shame.

03:46.629 --> 03:48.562
So you're done with catering?

03:48.564 --> 03:51.031
- It just doesn't
pay the bills.

03:51.033 --> 03:53.233
It does if you're good at it.

03:53.235 --> 03:54.935
Of course you can stay here.

03:54.937 --> 03:58.705
Thanks! Just until
I figure out a new career.

03:58.707 --> 04:00.040
I really appreciate it.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.176
You won't even know I'm here.

04:02.178 --> 04:05.679
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.

04:05.681 --> 04:06.613
[playing tune]

04:06.615 --> 04:10.384
Oh, hey! Just having a few
friends over to watch the fight.

04:10.386 --> 04:13.053
We might be a little loud,
just FYI.

04:13.055 --> 04:15.022
[chuckling]

04:15.024 --> 04:17.690
You mind if I set up
on the couch?

04:17.926 --> 04:19.159
Oh, make yourself at home.

04:19.161 --> 04:21.894
There's extra sheets
in the linen closet.

04:21.897 --> 04:23.730
Are you out of your mind?!

04:23.732 --> 04:25.699
You're just going
to let him stay here?!

04:25.701 --> 04:26.600
Until when?

04:26.602 --> 04:27.868
He's not going to get a job!

04:27.870 --> 04:31.004
He's just going to be here--
eating your food,

04:31.006 --> 04:32.573
Taking up space, making a mess.

04:32.575 --> 04:36.610
Do you have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

04:37.946 --> 04:40.714
I have some idea.

04:40.716 --> 04:41.782
Uh, just wondering

04:41.784 --> 04:43.984
When do you guys usually
get up in the morning?

04:43.986 --> 04:46.153
I want to have
breakfast waiting.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.822
Porky, you don't have
to make breakfast.

04:48.824 --> 04:50.324
Oh, yes, he does.

04:50.326 --> 04:51.859
He has to earn his keep.

04:51.861 --> 04:53.727
We all earn our keep
around here.

04:53.729 --> 04:58.765
Oh, hey, Bugs? We're out of
toilet paper in all the bathrooms.

04:58.767 --> 05:02.002
Don't ask.

05:06.174 --> 05:07.841
What are you doing
up this early?

05:07.843 --> 05:11.144
I never went to bed. I was
up all night making posters.

05:11.146 --> 05:12.880
What do you think of this one?

05:12.882 --> 05:15.215
"Steve is awesomer."

05:15.217 --> 05:16.550
Who is Steve?

05:16.552 --> 05:19.987
Well, you're the one who said
"Gossamer" isn't a word.

05:19.989 --> 05:21.989
No, I didn't.
You said that.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.625
[sighs] It is too early in the morning

05:24.627 --> 05:26.226
to be dealing with you.

05:26.228 --> 05:29.796
Well, good morning.
How do you like your eggs?

05:29.798 --> 05:31.932
In my hands.
I got to hit the road.

05:31.934 --> 05:36.904
Come on, man, what? You've never
put eggs in someone's hands before?

05:36.906 --> 05:39.506
[sizzling]

05:39.508 --> 05:42.376
Oh-ho-ho!
These--these are hot!

05:42.378 --> 05:44.044
Hot hands, coming through.

05:44.046 --> 05:45.913
[gasping]

05:45.915 --> 05:48.148
I'll take mine over medium.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.184
And on a plate.

05:57.926 --> 06:00.661
[doorbell rings]

06:00.663 --> 06:03.063
All right, let's get
cracking on your campaign.

06:03.065 --> 06:05.365
Now? But I have
to go to school.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.435
What? They expect you
to run for class president

06:08.437 --> 06:09.503
And go to class?

06:09.505 --> 06:11.572
There's not enough hours
in the day for that.

06:11.574 --> 06:13.974
Kids have it
too hard these days.

06:13.976 --> 06:17.110
Take a seat.

06:17.112 --> 06:18.345
As your campaign manager,

06:18.347 --> 06:22.015
I need you to be completely
and totally honest with me.

06:22.017 --> 06:24.751
Now, when you're running
for president,

06:24.753 --> 06:26.186
Everything comes out.

06:26.188 --> 06:29.523
You're about to be
opened up to a level of scrutiny

06:29.757 --> 06:31.358
That you can't imagine!

06:31.360 --> 06:33.527
So if there's anything
in your past,

06:33.529 --> 06:37.397
You better tell me right now.
Because the media will find out,

06:37.399 --> 06:41.335
And they will rake you
over the coals.

06:42.337 --> 06:45.372
Do you belong to any
unsavory organizations?

06:45.374 --> 06:46.206
No.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.109
- Any weird hobbies I should know about?
- No.

06:49.111 --> 06:51.078
- Even been found guilty of a crime?
- No.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.814
- You're telling me your
record is clean? - Uh-huh.

06:53.816 --> 06:58.418
- You're saying you have
no skeletons in your closet?

07:00.421 --> 07:02.823
- [gasps]
- Those are my mom's.

07:02.825 --> 07:04.958
- [gasping]
- What the...

07:04.960 --> 07:06.159
What are you doing in here?

07:06.161 --> 07:08.128
Now you know you're not
allowed in the house!

07:08.130 --> 07:11.665
Get on out of here! And
what are you doing in here?

07:11.667 --> 07:13.900
You know you not allowed
in the house, either.

07:13.902 --> 07:16.236
Mr. Duck is helping me
become class president.

07:16.238 --> 07:18.372
Well, you're not going
to become anything

07:18.374 --> 07:19.673
If you don't get to school.

07:19.675 --> 07:22.409
You already missed the bus.
- I'll take him.

07:22.411 --> 07:24.845
We'll do some campaign
strategizing on the way.

07:24.847 --> 07:26.880
Oh, hey, what would you think
of legally changing

07:26.882 --> 07:31.218
Gossamer's name to Steve?
Sounds more presidential.

07:31.753 --> 07:34.488
We can talk about it later.

07:34.490 --> 07:35.656
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

07:35.658 --> 07:39.593
Why doesn't he ever get
that rabbit to help him?

07:46.080 --> 07:47.214
Ah, I got to say, Porky,

07:47.216 --> 07:49.449
It's a pleasure
having you as a roommate.

07:49.451 --> 07:51.151
Can I make you some coffee?

07:51.153 --> 07:54.588
Ah, no, you're doing too much.

07:55.056 --> 07:58.125
Have you seen
the coffee filters?

07:58.127 --> 07:59.626
Oh, I put them in there.

07:59.628 --> 08:01.762
The counter was looking
so cluttered.

08:01.764 --> 08:05.832
You put the coffee filters
in the silverware drawer?

08:05.834 --> 08:09.169
Oh, no, I moved
the silverware to this drawer

08:09.171 --> 08:11.605
So they'd be closer
to the dishes.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.073
But the dishes are over here.

08:13.075 --> 08:16.810
Not anymore.
It didn't make any sense

08:16.812 --> 08:18.445
To have them all
the way over there,

08:18.447 --> 08:20.247
So far from the napkin drawer.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.583
I don't have a napkin drawer.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.685
Heh heh, you do now.

08:24.687 --> 08:27.554
See? Now the silverware
is next to the dishes,

08:27.556 --> 08:29.323
Which are next to the napkins.

08:29.325 --> 08:30.457
Now you have a system.

08:30.459 --> 08:34.595
Oh, uh, I didn't know
I needed a system.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.063
Everyone needs a system.

08:36.065 --> 08:40.000
Here, look what I did
with your pantry.

08:40.434 --> 08:43.503
So...Just...Get...Cooking!

08:43.505 --> 08:46.006
- What?
- It's an acronym.

08:46.008 --> 08:49.309
Soups, jars, grains, cereals.

08:49.311 --> 08:52.446
I didn't know I had
so much soup.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.182
[laughs] Well, of course you didn't, silly.

08:55.184 --> 08:57.084
It was all just so disorganized,

08:57.086 --> 08:59.653
You didn't know what you had.

08:59.655 --> 09:02.990
Ok...

09:07.061 --> 09:10.330
[chuckling]

09:16.704 --> 09:18.505
[school bell rings]

09:18.507 --> 09:21.408
[indistinct chatter]

09:21.410 --> 09:23.777
It's nice of you
to walk me to class.

09:23.779 --> 09:25.112
I'm not walking you to class.

09:25.114 --> 09:28.081
I'm looking for the best place
to put up your campaign poster.

09:28.083 --> 09:32.219
Figure out which part of the
school gets the most foot traffic.

09:32.221 --> 09:34.655
[gasps]

09:34.657 --> 09:38.458
Winnie Yang is running
for president?!

09:38.460 --> 09:39.559
Do you know her?

09:39.561 --> 09:41.995
Ohh, we had the same
piano teacher.

09:41.997 --> 09:44.531
She's an evil,
conniving, manipulative,

09:44.533 --> 09:45.866
hateful little weasel.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.701
Hi, Gossamer.

09:47.703 --> 09:49.302
Oh, hi, Winnie.

09:49.304 --> 09:52.372
You know, if you'd rather
put your poster here,

09:52.374 --> 09:53.507
I'm happy to move mine.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.877
Oh, hi, Mr. Duck.
Nice to see you again.

09:56.879 --> 10:01.682
She's even worse
than I remember.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.451
[grunting and groaning]

10:10.992 --> 10:12.459
Who's Steve?

10:12.461 --> 10:15.262
Ohh, you and Bugs.

10:15.763 --> 10:19.166
I'm telling you,
you're making a mistake.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.102
Steve's the way to go.

10:24.305 --> 10:28.141
[humming and giggling]

10:31.713 --> 10:33.880
Do you mind?

10:33.882 --> 10:35.215
Oh, not at all.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.984
Your desk was in
desperate need of a system.

10:37.986 --> 10:38.919
I meant the humming.

10:38.921 --> 10:42.489
Was I humming? [laughs]
I hadn't noticed.

10:42.491 --> 10:44.958
Come see what I've done.

10:45.793 --> 10:50.197
Before, your writing implements
were just scattered all about.

10:50.199 --> 10:52.199
Gee, that sounds dangerous.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.069
Heh, well, not dangerous.
But certainly inefficient.

10:56.071 --> 10:59.706
So now, I've put
your blue ink pens here

10:59.708 --> 11:02.576
Next to the phone
for jotting down messages,

11:02.578 --> 11:06.012
Your black ink pens here
next to your checkbook,

11:06.014 --> 11:08.615
Your pencils here
next to the sharpener,

11:08.617 --> 11:12.219
And this is for miscellaneous
writing instruments,

11:12.221 --> 11:14.755
Such as red ink pens
and highlighters.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.623
Oh, gee, thanks, Porky.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.091
I can't tell you
how many times

11:18.093 --> 11:20.127
I accidentally
jotted down a message

11:20.129 --> 11:21.661
With the wrong-colored pen.

11:21.663 --> 11:23.663
Oh, you poor thing.

11:23.665 --> 11:27.000
Well, my next product
is your hutch.

11:27.002 --> 11:28.535
[humming]

11:28.537 --> 11:31.938
I'm going
to put on some music.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.940
[humming]

11:33.942 --> 11:37.144
Some actual music.

11:37.146 --> 11:41.248
Porky, did you alphabetize
my albums?

11:41.250 --> 11:42.849
Not just alphabetized.

11:42.851 --> 11:44.651
They're also grouped by genre.

11:44.653 --> 11:48.288
I've got your jazz here,
your classical here,

11:48.290 --> 11:50.590
And I'm not sure why
you have so much reggae,

11:50.592 --> 11:51.758
But that's all here.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.462
You really have a system
for everything, don't you?

11:55.464 --> 11:59.533
Wait until you see
your linen closet!

12:00.968 --> 12:04.371
Uh, Porky,
have you given any more thought

12:04.373 --> 12:07.641
As to what kind of career
you might want to pursue?

12:07.643 --> 12:09.476
You know, so you can...

12:09.478 --> 12:13.146
Oh, I don't know. I'm really
not sure what I'd be good at.

12:13.148 --> 12:16.616
Well, you went to college.
What's your degree in?

12:16.618 --> 12:18.819
Medieval poetry.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.788
Of course it is.
What about your minor?

12:21.790 --> 12:24.124
- Architecture.
- Well, there you go.

12:24.126 --> 12:25.425
That's something.

12:25.427 --> 12:26.993
Medieval architecture.

12:26.995 --> 12:31.331
So like castles and moats?
That sort of thing?

12:31.432 --> 12:33.033
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

12:33.035 --> 12:35.836
Not really much demand
for that these days.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.104
Uh-huh.

12:41.475 --> 12:42.809
What's that?

12:42.811 --> 12:45.745
It's a papier-mâché
statue of Gossamer.

12:45.747 --> 12:48.849
Make the kids think of him
as presidential material.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.551
So is this why
we're out of toilet paper?

12:51.553 --> 12:53.320
No. That was
a separate incident.

12:53.322 --> 12:55.155
And I said I didn't
want to talk about it.

12:55.157 --> 12:58.458
There. I got to paint
this sucker orange.

12:58.460 --> 12:59.626
Do we have any paintbrushes?

12:59.628 --> 13:01.895
Have you checked
the paintbrush drawer?

13:01.897 --> 13:04.231
We have a drawer
just for paintbrushes?

13:04.233 --> 13:07.167
Not that.
That's our tape drawer.

13:07.169 --> 13:10.604
Nuh-uh, no, no, that's
our permanent marker drawer,

13:10.606 --> 13:14.207
Not to be confused with the
non-permanent marker drawer,

13:14.209 --> 13:16.209
Which is just below that.

13:16.211 --> 13:18.111
I hate it! I just hate it!

13:18.113 --> 13:20.780
Whoa-ho! What are you
so worked up about?

13:20.782 --> 13:23.049
I don't know!
I just, it's that pig

13:23.051 --> 13:25.919
And all his perfect
little systems!

13:25.921 --> 13:27.520
[gasps]

13:27.522 --> 13:29.689
Whoops. Can you hand me
a paper towel?

13:29.691 --> 13:32.492
Just leave it.
Look, it's better to have a mess

13:32.494 --> 13:33.760
Than to try to figure out

13:33.762 --> 13:35.295
Whether to put
the wet paper towel

13:35.297 --> 13:36.630
Into the paper
recycling bin

13:36.797 --> 13:38.732
Or the wet items
recycling bin,

13:38.734 --> 13:42.135
Because then it would be
both paper and wet!

13:42.137 --> 13:44.571
Piggy doesn't have
a system for that!

13:44.573 --> 13:46.239
Man, you got to relax.

13:46.241 --> 13:48.775
Go listen
to some of your reggae.

13:48.777 --> 13:50.744
Oh, dear.

13:52.380 --> 13:55.015
[humming]

13:55.783 --> 14:01.187
Let me just put this in
the wet paper recycling bin.

14:02.189 --> 14:06.526
I guess he does have
a system for that.

14:06.528 --> 14:07.861
Uh, Mr. Duck?

14:07.863 --> 14:09.863
[gasps]
I forgot you were in there.

14:09.865 --> 14:14.067
I need to use the bathroom.
How do I get out of here?

14:14.069 --> 14:15.702
Hmm.

14:15.704 --> 14:17.570
That's a good question.

14:17.572 --> 14:20.307
Let me think about that.

14:21.676 --> 14:24.411
Hello?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.040
Who in the name
of Pancho Villa

14:43.108 --> 14:44.775
has been in my mouse hole?!

14:44.777 --> 14:46.277
What are you talking about?

14:46.279 --> 14:49.146
My cheeses.
Someone organized my cheeses.

14:49.148 --> 14:51.749
By color, consistency
and pungency.

14:51.751 --> 14:54.151
And my DVDs!
They've organized them, too.

14:54.153 --> 14:57.855
By genre, release date,
and pungency.

14:58.390 --> 14:59.657
You know, pungency.

14:59.659 --> 15:02.726
In terms of how intense
the story line is.

15:05.263 --> 15:08.065
How did he even get in there?

15:08.067 --> 15:10.034
- Who?
- Porky.

15:10.036 --> 15:11.101
Porky did this?

15:11.103 --> 15:14.138
Oh, I'm going to have
a word with him!

15:17.942 --> 15:20.544
What?

15:22.914 --> 15:24.515
I'll tell you what.

15:24.517 --> 15:26.183
I love what you did
with my place!

15:26.185 --> 15:29.386
There's a system for everything;
it's so efficient!

15:29.388 --> 15:31.322
Oh! I'm glad you like it.

15:31.324 --> 15:33.390
Wait until you see
what I have planned

15:33.392 --> 15:35.526
For Bugs' garage.

15:35.528 --> 15:37.194
No! I mean, uh,

15:37.196 --> 15:39.463
You've already done
so much around here.

15:39.465 --> 15:41.165
Isn't there more
you could do for Speedy?

15:41.167 --> 15:44.201
What more could he do for me?
My place is perfect.

15:44.203 --> 15:48.138
Uh, well, what about Pizzariba?

15:48.140 --> 15:49.139
Huh.

15:49.141 --> 15:51.275
Well, I'd be happy
to take a look around

15:51.277 --> 15:53.110
And see if there's
anything I can do.

15:53.112 --> 15:55.245
Here, let me just put
these groceries away

15:55.247 --> 15:58.082
And we can go check it out.

15:58.084 --> 16:00.150
Gracias, Bugs.

16:00.152 --> 16:02.786
No. Thank you.

16:03.888 --> 16:05.122
Oh, man.

16:05.124 --> 16:08.425
I never knew
you had so much reggae.

16:08.493 --> 16:10.494
What happened to the pantry?!

16:10.496 --> 16:11.562
Daffy did it.

16:11.564 --> 16:15.032
- If Winnie Yang
is elected president,

16:15.034 --> 16:19.370
School will begin
at 4:30 in the morning

16:19.372 --> 16:22.039
And go to 9:30 at night!

16:22.173 --> 16:27.411
Winnie Yang promises
to do away with recess,

16:27.413 --> 16:31.582
weekends, and summer vacations!

16:31.584 --> 16:32.683
But none of that is true.

16:32.685 --> 16:35.285
Trust me-- this is how
you win elections.

16:35.287 --> 16:39.490
Winnie Yang
wants to only serve broccoli

16:39.492 --> 16:43.260
And brussels sprouts
in the school cafeteria.

16:43.262 --> 16:45.729
- [grunts]
- Give me!

16:45.731 --> 16:47.798
[both grunting]

16:47.800 --> 16:50.267
[tires squealing]

16:54.072 --> 16:57.508
Winnie Yang did that!

16:58.810 --> 17:03.080
Ok, the way you had
things organized before,

17:03.082 --> 17:05.315
You had to run
all over the kitchen

17:05.317 --> 17:06.650
Just to make a pizza.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.685
But now, with the ingredient
dispensing system

17:09.688 --> 17:10.686
I've installed,

17:10.689 --> 17:14.223
The process is not only fast,
it's fully automated.

17:14.226 --> 17:16.859
Remember how you used to have
to get the dough

17:16.862 --> 17:19.530
From the refrigerator
and then hand roll it?

17:19.531 --> 17:21.832
Well, not anymore.

17:21.834 --> 17:26.770
And no more wasted time
opening cans of tomato sauce.

17:28.640 --> 17:33.710
Have you ever seen
such evenly distributed cheese?

17:33.712 --> 17:37.915
How about all of your toppings
at a press of a button?

17:39.551 --> 17:41.051
And off it goes, into the oven,

17:41.053 --> 17:45.022
Leaving you more time to spend
out front with your customers.

17:45.024 --> 17:46.223
You're a genius.

17:46.225 --> 17:49.259
But I don't understand why you
would even need a system like this.

17:49.261 --> 17:51.929
You're so fast,
it doesn't even matter

17:51.931 --> 17:53.263
How disorganized things are.

17:53.265 --> 17:55.199
That's true
for this restaurant,

17:55.201 --> 17:56.500
But I want to expand.

17:56.502 --> 17:57.668
I may be fast, but I can't be

17:57.670 --> 17:58.969
In 15 different cities
all at once.

17:58.971 --> 18:02.639
Porky, what do you think of having
me set up Pizzaribas like this

18:02.774 --> 18:04.508
All across the country?

18:04.510 --> 18:06.577
Ohh, I don't know.

18:06.579 --> 18:08.479
I should really be figuring out

18:08.481 --> 18:10.247
What I'm going
to do for a career.

18:10.249 --> 18:14.718
What did you think,
I wasn't going to pay you?

18:15.520 --> 18:18.956
We'll call you Pizzariba's
vice president of, uh,

18:18.958 --> 18:21.492
Kitchen organizing...
Or something.

18:21.494 --> 18:24.728
I don't know. We'll think
of a good title for you.

18:24.730 --> 18:28.799
I was also thinking
of having these new Pizzaribas

18:28.801 --> 18:29.833
Look a little different.

18:29.835 --> 18:32.002
You know, maybe like
we come up with a theme,

18:32.004 --> 18:34.338
Like they all look like
little castles or something.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.976
Do you know anything
about medieval architecture?

18:40.478 --> 18:42.145
[tires squealing]

18:42.147 --> 18:44.248
Well, today's the day.
Election day.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.484
We've run a great campaign.
We've avoided the issues,

18:47.486 --> 18:50.254
Made baseless attacks
against your opponent,

18:50.256 --> 18:53.457
And plagiarized this speech
from the great communicator,

18:53.459 --> 18:55.259
Ronald Reagan.

18:55.261 --> 18:57.794
I know it seems heavy on Russia,

18:57.796 --> 19:03.000
But when you say,
"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall!"

19:03.002 --> 19:05.836
There won't be
a dry eye in the house.

19:05.838 --> 19:11.408
Now go in there
and get elected president.

19:12.577 --> 19:15.445
He's going to do great.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.180
He liked it?

19:17.182 --> 19:18.549
He loved it.

19:18.551 --> 19:21.285
Speedy's going to expand
all across the country,

19:21.287 --> 19:23.086
And he wants me to help.

19:23.088 --> 19:24.655
I can't thank you enough, Bugs.

19:24.657 --> 19:27.958
None of this would have happened
if it weren't for you.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.761
Huh. What's
with the suitcases?

19:30.763 --> 19:34.097
I bought my own house back.
What can I say?

19:34.099 --> 19:35.666
Being the Pizzariba's
vice president

19:35.668 --> 19:39.670
Of organization systems and
medieval design pays pretty well.

19:39.904 --> 19:43.674
Well, we're still
figuring out my title.

19:52.617 --> 19:56.186
[cans clattering]

19:59.357 --> 20:01.391
[school bell rings]

20:01.393 --> 20:04.094
Mr. Duck, Mr. Duck.

20:04.096 --> 20:05.662
You won?!

20:05.664 --> 20:08.899
No. I didn't even come close.

20:08.901 --> 20:11.134
Then why on earth
are you happy?

20:11.136 --> 20:12.269
Because I had fun.

20:12.271 --> 20:14.605
I always have fun
hanging out with you.

20:14.772 --> 20:15.839
Me, too, kid.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.008
And I learned
a valuable lesson.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.010
- What's that?
- It doesn't matter

20:20.012 --> 20:21.378
Whether you win or lose,

20:21.380 --> 20:23.213
It's having the courage to try.

20:23.215 --> 20:25.449
Huh. I thought you were
going to say,

20:25.451 --> 20:26.617
Never try for anything ever

20:26.619 --> 20:28.418
Unless
you're guaranteed success.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.822
But, whatever. As long
as you learned a lesson.

20:31.824 --> 20:33.290
Ugh.
- What is it?

20:33.292 --> 20:36.593
I can't believe Winnie Yang
is president.

20:36.595 --> 20:38.428
- Winnie's not president.
- What?!

20:38.430 --> 20:42.733
There was a third candidate.
That's him right there.

20:44.235 --> 20:46.637
Congratulations again, Steve.

20:46.804 --> 20:48.705
Steve? Steve?!

20:48.707 --> 20:50.607
I told you we should have
changed your name.

20:50.609 --> 20:55.312
No one ever listens to me.
Not your mom, not Bugs, not you.

20:55.314 --> 20:57.614
Well, you listen
to me sometimes.

20:57.616 --> 20:58.782
Probably not enough, though.

20:58.784 --> 21:00.150
You should take notes
while I talk.

21:00.152 --> 21:04.121
You never know when I'm going
to say something brilliant.

21:07.025 --> 21:08.258
Hola, Cincinnati, Ohio.

21:08.260 --> 21:13.196
And bienvenidos at our grand
opening of our newest Pizzariba.

21:13.198 --> 21:16.366
[cheers and applause]

21:21.172 --> 21:23.273
I couldn't have done this
without you, Pinky.

21:23.275 --> 21:25.342
[all screaming]
don't worry!

21:25.344 --> 21:27.477
Those aren't real crocodiles!

21:27.479 --> 21:28.912
[crunch crunch]

21:28.914 --> 21:32.249
Those aren't
real crocodiles, are they?
