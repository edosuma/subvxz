00:15.565 --> 00:17.166
Jack!

00:17.233 --> 00:18.634
We need a medic!

00:18.702 --> 00:20.536
The bioagent is more virulent
than we thought.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.870
All we're doing
here is just

00:21.938 --> 00:23.706
masking the symptoms.
I understand.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.342
There's something
you may want to consider.

00:26.410 --> 00:27.576
What's that?

00:27.644 --> 00:28.644
A possible treatment

00:28.712 --> 00:30.313
using stems cells from

00:30.380 --> 00:31.580
a genetically-compatible donor.

00:31.648 --> 00:33.549
I saw your file.
It says you have a daughter.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.917
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

00:34.984 --> 00:36.519
Daddy.

00:36.586 --> 00:39.488
Agent Walker told me
that there's a chance,

00:39.556 --> 00:42.425
a small chance
that I could help you,

00:42.492 --> 00:44.259
and you don't want me to.

00:44.328 --> 00:46.495
I'm dying,

00:46.563 --> 00:48.163
and whatever small
chance there is

00:48.231 --> 00:50.032
to stop that
from happening,

00:50.099 --> 00:52.100
it is not worth the pain

00:52.168 --> 00:55.070
for me to let you sit there
and watch me die.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.641
Jack, Hodges has
13 Python missiles

00:58.709 --> 01:00.376
armed with the bioweapons.

01:00.444 --> 01:02.645
He demanded
that I recall the planes,

01:02.713 --> 01:03.646
or he would launch.

01:03.714 --> 01:05.715
Tony Almeida is still
inside Starkwood.

01:05.782 --> 01:07.850
He believes he can gain access
to the fuel depot,

01:07.917 --> 01:09.318
and lay a series
of explosive charges,

01:09.386 --> 01:10.486
and take the missiles out.

01:10.554 --> 01:11.754
What do you think you're doing?

01:11.822 --> 01:14.557
You're gonna take me down
to the fuel tanks.

01:19.195 --> 01:20.095
You're too late.

01:29.639 --> 01:32.074
Jonas, we've taken out
your missiles.

01:32.141 --> 01:33.609
It's over,
and you're under arrest.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.078
You can't even begin to
imagine what you're up against.

01:36.145 --> 01:37.279
What are you talking about?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.114
You'll find out.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.616
Agent Moss, this is Davis
at Auxiliary Gate Six.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.651
I have a Starkwood op
in custody.

01:42.719 --> 01:44.319
He was carrying a canister
of the bioweapon.

01:44.388 --> 01:46.689
Are you sure?
I'm looking at
it right now.

01:49.393 --> 01:50.593
One of the
Starkwood ops--

01:50.660 --> 01:52.361
he's got a canister
of the bioweapon.

01:52.429 --> 01:54.930
So I need you to close
down all access roads,

01:54.998 --> 01:56.198
and alert perimeter
units and Metro Police.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.566
Janis, get me
D.C. Metro.

01:57.634 --> 01:58.967
I'm gonna pursue
from the air.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.202
Let's go!

02:02.572 --> 02:05.408
Come on!

02:10.913 --> 02:12.214
I'm okay.

02:12.282 --> 02:13.982
Tony! Tony!

02:16.085 --> 02:19.522
Oh, God. Oh...

02:32.836 --> 02:33.936
Yeah?

02:34.003 --> 02:35.203
Patricia, Matt.

02:35.271 --> 02:36.939
I just got off
with Secret Service.

02:37.006 --> 02:39.374
You're cleared with White House
security at the south entrance.

02:39.443 --> 02:42.177
How soon do you think
you'll get there?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.512
Uh, within the half-hour.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.781
Do you have any more information
why Hodges was arrested?

02:45.849 --> 02:47.149
They didn't give me a lot.

02:47.216 --> 02:48.551
Apparently,
Jonas was in some kind

02:48.618 --> 02:49.919
of policy meeting
with the president,

02:49.986 --> 02:51.520
and things got out of hand.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.156
That's when he requested
his favorite attorney.

02:54.223 --> 02:55.424
I'm flattered.

02:55.492 --> 02:58.093
I'll call you
after I've spoken to him.

03:38.768 --> 03:39.969
Hurry it up.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.899
Janis, we just got
an ID on the suspect.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.001
One of Starkwood's
security cameras

04:12.068 --> 04:14.403
picked him up leaving
the compound; he was
carrying a backpack.

04:14.470 --> 04:16.005
Robert Galvez, two-year
Starkwood employee,

04:16.072 --> 04:17.973
former special forces.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.776
Relay that information
to Larry-- he needs to
know who he's tracking.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.645
I've been trying.
He's not answering his comm.

04:22.712 --> 04:24.246
How far away is backup?

04:24.313 --> 04:26.949
They're still a few minutes out,
but Agent Park's teams

04:27.017 --> 04:29.451
have secured a
four-block perimeter.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.021
The bioweapons canister
is secured within the cordon.

04:32.088 --> 04:33.321
Get Galvez' picture
and description out

04:33.389 --> 04:34.623
to Tactical and
distribute department wide.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.559
- Got it.
- And keep trying Larry.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.095
To all units,

04:40.163 --> 04:42.031
I'm uploading a photo
of the suspect

04:42.098 --> 04:43.532
to all units' PDAs.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.100
His name is Robert Galvez.

04:45.168 --> 04:46.535
Be advised

04:46.603 --> 04:48.003
he has advanced
military training,

04:48.071 --> 04:49.805
so proceed with caution.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.040
Roger that.

05:20.036 --> 05:22.270
Almeida?
Almeida, are you there?

05:22.338 --> 05:24.172
Are you in a secure location?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.976
I'm holed up in a storage yard
near the projects on Jefferson.

05:27.043 --> 05:28.343
But I just spotted a patrol.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.745
I think I better keep moving.

05:29.813 --> 05:30.913
No, don't.

05:32.148 --> 05:33.949
The FBI's got the entire
perimeter locked down.

05:34.017 --> 05:35.317
And they know who you are.

05:35.384 --> 05:37.185
- How?
- They have a picture.

05:37.253 --> 05:40.089
Which means the search teams can
ID you on sight.

05:40.156 --> 05:42.290
Just stay put
until I can get a read

05:42.358 --> 05:44.493
on their search protocols,
and I'll guide you out.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.194
I should have never have let you
talk me into helping you.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.497
I promise you,
that canister you stole for me

05:48.564 --> 05:51.600
is worth a lot of money
to the people I'm working for.

05:51.668 --> 05:53.535
Hell of a lot of good that
money's gonna do me in prison.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.403
Just shut up and do
what I tell you to do.

05:55.471 --> 05:58.741
Guard the canister, stay put,
and wait for my call.

06:10.553 --> 06:11.920
We've got agents down.

06:11.988 --> 06:15.423
Get a med team
out here now.

06:15.491 --> 06:17.526
Almeida?

06:17.593 --> 06:19.594
Almeida, can you hear me?

06:20.864 --> 06:21.964
What happened?

06:22.032 --> 06:23.298
Where's the suspect?

06:23.366 --> 06:24.599
He ambushed us.

06:24.668 --> 06:26.735
Did you see
where he went?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.738
I don't know.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.073
Renee, I just got confirmation

06:31.141 --> 06:33.341
the Tac Team has arrived
at the scene.

06:33.409 --> 06:35.277
Do we have a
20 on Larry?
Not yet.

06:35.344 --> 06:37.713
Excuse me,
Agent Walker.

06:37.781 --> 06:39.048
I know you're busy.
Kim.

06:39.115 --> 06:41.050
I just came to say good-bye.

06:41.117 --> 06:42.450
Good-bye? Where are you going?

06:42.518 --> 06:44.153
Back to L.A.

06:44.220 --> 06:45.888
Um, I don't understand.

06:45.955 --> 06:47.089
You're not going through

06:47.157 --> 06:48.924
with the treatment
to help your father?

06:48.992 --> 06:51.393
I mean, it's his only
chance for a cure.

06:51.460 --> 06:52.895
I know that, and so does he.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.429
But it's a slim one,

06:54.497 --> 06:56.431
and he believes

06:56.499 --> 06:58.233
it's not worth taking, so...

06:58.301 --> 07:01.804
If he's going to die,
he wants it to be on his terms.

07:01.871 --> 07:04.840
Yes, but can't you
change his mind?

07:04.908 --> 07:06.675
I would think you'd know by now

07:06.743 --> 07:08.677
that no one can change
my father's mind

07:08.745 --> 07:09.845
when it's made up.

07:09.913 --> 07:12.347
I'm... I'm sorry.

07:12.415 --> 07:15.317
I'm sorry
that I put you in this position.

07:15.384 --> 07:16.551
No, don't be.

07:16.619 --> 07:18.687
I'm grateful to you,
Agent Walker.

07:18.755 --> 07:21.256
My father and I got to say
a lot of things to each other.

07:21.324 --> 07:22.524
I wish I could have said more,

07:22.592 --> 07:24.960
but I don't want
to cause him any more pain.

07:25.028 --> 07:25.994
Renee?

07:26.062 --> 07:27.262
Agent Park is on the phone
for you.

07:27.330 --> 07:30.465
I need to take this.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.668
I understand.

07:33.737 --> 07:35.537
Good luck.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.976
This is Walker.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.544
Agent Moss is dead.

07:44.580 --> 07:45.948
What?

07:46.015 --> 07:48.817
Apparently, he was killed
in an ambush by the suspect.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.052
The chopper pilot, too.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.155
Tony Almeida's been shot,
but he's alive.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.423
I've got medical personnel
working on him now.

07:56.459 --> 07:58.460
Agent Walker?

08:00.029 --> 08:02.965
Do we have any lead on Galvez?

08:03.032 --> 08:04.466
No, but the area's
been cordoned off.

08:04.533 --> 08:05.901
He couldn't
have gotten far.

08:05.969 --> 08:08.503
We're setting up an operations
base here on the scene

08:08.571 --> 08:09.805
to coordinate the manhunt.

08:09.873 --> 08:11.373
How do you want to proceed?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.775
Me?

08:12.842 --> 08:14.843
You're the ranking agent
in charge now.

08:19.215 --> 08:21.150
Maintain the perimeter.

08:21.217 --> 08:23.618
Begin a south-north sweep.

08:23.686 --> 08:27.389
I'll chopper out a team and
meet you there as soon as I can.

08:27.456 --> 08:29.124
Agent Walker, I have more
than enough personnel.

08:29.192 --> 08:30.425
You don't need to be involved

08:30.493 --> 08:32.160
in the search.
Yes, I do.

08:32.227 --> 08:35.164
Keep me posted
if you hear anything.

08:35.231 --> 08:37.166
Yes, ma'am.

08:37.232 --> 08:38.566
Larry?

08:38.634 --> 08:42.037
He was killed in a shootout
with the suspect.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.506
Oh, God.

08:44.573 --> 08:46.474
I need you to brief the
White House on what's happened.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.277
Call Dr. Macer and have her
deploy a HazMat team

08:48.344 --> 08:49.444
to the perimeter line.

08:49.512 --> 08:50.612
Assemble a team

08:50.680 --> 08:52.881
to chopper
out with me.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.018
I'm so sorry.

08:56.085 --> 08:58.653
Someone's going to need
to notify Larry's ex-wife.

09:00.857 --> 09:03.125
Probably shouldn't be me.

09:03.193 --> 09:04.993
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

09:13.269 --> 09:14.402
All right.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.239
We've debriefed on hours
8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.542
pertaining to the CIP recovery
and the capture of Ike Dubaku.

09:20.609 --> 09:21.877
Now, Mr. Bauer,

09:21.945 --> 09:23.879
maybe you'd like
to take a break.

09:23.947 --> 09:26.481
No. We need to finish this
while I still can.

09:26.549 --> 09:27.649
Let's go.

09:27.717 --> 09:28.783
Now, according

09:28.852 --> 09:30.485
to your earlier statement,

09:30.553 --> 09:32.221
it was about this
time you received

09:32.288 --> 09:34.389
intel regarding the imminent
attack on the White House.

09:34.457 --> 09:36.959
Tony Almeida provided me
with the intel,

09:37.026 --> 09:38.293
but we did not know

09:38.361 --> 09:40.662
the White House was
a target at that time.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.297
And who was Mr.
Almeida's source?

09:42.365 --> 09:44.967
He was interrogating
a mercenary.

09:45.034 --> 09:46.735
Did Almeida give
you a name?

09:46.802 --> 09:48.603
Um...

09:48.671 --> 09:50.672
Yeah. Sorry.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.510
Car... Cardiff. He said
his name was Vincent Cardiff.

09:55.578 --> 09:58.247
Did you yourself
question the source?

09:58.314 --> 09:59.982
No.

10:00.049 --> 10:01.250
He didn't survive
Tony's interrogation,

10:01.317 --> 10:03.919
but he was the one
who provided us with the intel

10:03.987 --> 10:05.087
on the upcoming attack.

10:05.154 --> 10:06.521
But we did not know

10:06.589 --> 10:08.556
that the White House was the
intended target at that time.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.592
We did not know the White House
was the intended target...

10:10.659 --> 10:11.659
Mr. Bauer?

10:13.229 --> 10:16.298
You sure you don't want
to take that break?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.433
Um, I'm repeating myself again.

10:18.501 --> 10:20.435
I'm sorry.

10:22.105 --> 10:23.038
Here's the data file

10:23.106 --> 10:24.339
you asked for, sir.

10:24.407 --> 10:26.041
Tom, we need to move.

10:26.109 --> 10:27.575
Agent Walker's got
our assignments.

10:29.913 --> 10:31.914
Excuse me.

10:36.752 --> 10:39.687
We're not going to lose
control of this situation.

10:39.755 --> 10:42.291
I know that most of you are
tired, working double shifts,

10:42.358 --> 10:44.893
but I need each and every one
of you focused and alert

10:44.961 --> 10:46.661
if we are going
to locate the suspect

10:46.729 --> 10:48.563
and secure the bioweapon
canister that he's carrying.

10:48.631 --> 10:50.132
While I am out in the field,

10:50.199 --> 10:51.466
you will pass
all pertinent information

10:51.534 --> 10:52.801
out of this office
through Janis.

10:52.868 --> 10:55.137
Let's get to work. Adams,
you and your men are with me.

10:55.204 --> 10:57.572
Renee? Renee?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.374
I'll meet you
at the helipad.

10:59.442 --> 11:00.909
The bioweapon's
still out there?

11:00.977 --> 11:02.044
We have it contained.

11:02.111 --> 11:03.545
Wait a second.

11:03.612 --> 11:04.746
Wait a second.

11:04.814 --> 11:06.748
Just tell me what the
hell is going on.

11:06.816 --> 11:08.750
A Starkwood operative
by the name of Robert Galvez

11:08.818 --> 11:10.385
got away with a canister
of the pathogen.

11:10.453 --> 11:12.387
We have him trapped inside
a perimeter a mile or so

11:12.455 --> 11:13.555
from Starkwood's compound.

11:13.622 --> 11:15.023
Is Larry in command
of the perimeter?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.524
He was killed
in a firefight.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.592
What?

11:17.660 --> 11:19.094
Tony was injured.

11:19.162 --> 11:20.728
He's at the scene
with the advance team.

11:20.796 --> 11:22.597
Larry's dead?

11:22.665 --> 11:24.366
We have two agents down.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.467
Yes. I have to go.

11:33.809 --> 11:35.743
You're lucky.
An inch to the left,

11:35.811 --> 11:37.846
the bullet might have nicked
your splenic artery.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.781
You need to get yourself
checked out at the
hospital, sir.

11:39.849 --> 11:41.216
Yeah, I can't do that
right now.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.085
Let me get you something
for the pain.

11:43.152 --> 11:45.354
No, I, I need to keep
my head clear.

11:45.421 --> 11:48.223
Sweep 9, this is Mobile Command,
what's your status?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.725
Mobile Command, this is Sweep 9,
Southeast grid 211 clear.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.560
Moving on.
Copy that, Sweep 9.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.695
Sweep 7, what's
your position?

11:53.762 --> 11:55.697
Clearing 214. Nothing so far.

11:55.764 --> 11:57.065
No sign of him?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.100
Don't worry.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.267
We'll find him.

11:59.335 --> 12:01.069
You should get some rest.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.138
Thanks.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.342
...this is Mobile Command,
status check, over.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.880
Yeah?
Yeah, they're sweeping

12:11.947 --> 12:13.548
north, clearing grids.

12:13.616 --> 12:14.782
You've got a clear path

12:14.850 --> 12:17.386
on Jefferson all the way up
to 12th and 13th Street.

12:17.453 --> 12:19.454
That should be the last sector
they're searching.

12:19.522 --> 12:20.755
Judging by their progress,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.357
it'll give you
about 30 minutes.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.725
Should be plenty
of time.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.894
Time for what?

12:25.961 --> 12:27.896
You still got that
C-4 I gave you?

12:27.963 --> 12:29.898
Yeah. I got it.
All right.

12:29.965 --> 12:31.900
I want you to find
a structure,

12:31.967 --> 12:33.668
a store, warehouse,
something big enough

12:33.736 --> 12:35.303
where they have to
enter and search.

12:35.371 --> 12:38.606
We need to draw as many of them
into the building as possible,

12:38.674 --> 12:40.108
then blow it.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.777
You want me to blow up a couple
of dozen FBI agents?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.079
You got a problem with that?

12:44.147 --> 12:45.280
They're still gonna have
the perimeter locked down.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.515
I don't see how doing this

12:46.582 --> 12:48.083
is gonna get me out of here
with the canister.

12:48.151 --> 12:49.951
Yeah, I've got that worked out.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.667
Jack, what the hell
are you doing?

13:05.734 --> 13:07.369
I'm going with you.

13:07.437 --> 13:08.603
You're ill.

13:08.671 --> 13:10.505
If my condition interferes
with your operation,

13:10.573 --> 13:11.540
I will stand down.

13:11.607 --> 13:13.508
I give you
my word.
Jack...

13:13.576 --> 13:14.609
You want keep arguing
about this,

13:14.677 --> 13:15.643
waste more time? Fine.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.312
I'm not getting out.

13:40.488 --> 13:41.988
Good morning.

13:42.056 --> 13:44.124
Good morning.

13:44.488 --> 13:45.588
Ms. Eames.

13:45.656 --> 13:47.256
You're Jonas Hodges'
attorney.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.991
That's right.

13:49.059 --> 13:50.560
They told us
to expect you.

13:50.627 --> 13:52.195
I just need you to
place your thumb

13:52.262 --> 13:54.263
against the glass.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.741
Okay. Sergeant Cadden
will escort you

14:05.809 --> 14:07.810
to the holding area.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.414
Thank you.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.917
How could this man have
gotten out of Starkwood

14:14.984 --> 14:16.452
with a canister of
the bioweapon?

14:16.520 --> 14:17.486
No one's sure.

14:17.554 --> 14:18.987
But he's already murdered
four people.

14:19.055 --> 14:21.056
Including Larry Moss.

14:23.093 --> 14:25.361
The FBI has
tracked him

14:25.429 --> 14:26.529
to a nearby residential
district.

14:26.597 --> 14:28.030
They've sealed
off the area

14:28.098 --> 14:30.199
and are conducting
a thorough search.

14:30.267 --> 14:32.235
Mom, this man Galvez is
a Starkwood operative.

14:32.302 --> 14:34.870
Clearly, Hodges is
behind this.

14:34.938 --> 14:36.205
Maybe.

14:36.273 --> 14:37.840
What do you mean,
maybe?

14:39.876 --> 14:41.544
As Hodges was
taken away,

14:41.612 --> 14:43.579
he said it wasn't over.

14:43.647 --> 14:46.716
He alluded to others,
called himself

14:46.783 --> 14:49.619
a small cog in a very large
machine that I wouldn't

14:49.686 --> 14:51.153
be able to stop.
He was ranting.

14:51.221 --> 14:53.589
That doesn't mean he wasn't
telling the truth.

14:53.657 --> 14:55.758
We need to find out what
Hodges knows about this.

14:55.825 --> 14:58.861
I want him taken to the FBI
for interrogation.

14:58.928 --> 15:00.896
He's a sociopath, Mom.

15:00.964 --> 15:02.965
He's not going to talk.
He's going to want

15:03.032 --> 15:05.801
to make some kind of deal in
exchange for his cooperation.

15:08.505 --> 15:10.640
Mom, you're not
considering that...

15:10.707 --> 15:11.774
Olivia...

15:11.841 --> 15:14.744
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

15:14.811 --> 15:16.812
Just get him to FBI.

15:27.324 --> 15:28.291
Mr. Hodges.

15:28.358 --> 15:29.425
Your attorney's

15:29.493 --> 15:31.427
here to see you.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.961
Well, it's about damn time.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.874
We're going to need
some privacy.

15:51.682 --> 15:53.316
You're a little taller than her.

15:53.383 --> 15:54.350
But it's

15:54.418 --> 15:56.352
a good look
for you.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.354
Hello, Jonas.

15:58.422 --> 16:00.356
I'm not going to ask
how you got in.

16:00.424 --> 16:01.691
But I'm

16:01.758 --> 16:04.627
definitely interested in how
you're going to get me out.

16:06.129 --> 16:07.830
Jonas, you're in a very

16:07.897 --> 16:09.832
difficult position.

16:09.899 --> 16:11.834
And your actions today
have put everyone else

16:11.901 --> 16:13.502
in a very difficult
position.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.338
Oh, I see.

16:15.405 --> 16:18.341
I've upset the cart, have I?

16:18.408 --> 16:21.344
Everyone's bent out of shape.

16:21.411 --> 16:23.346
Well, where the hell were they

16:23.413 --> 16:25.180
when the government came
after my company?

16:25.248 --> 16:27.850
When Senator Mayer and his
subpoena-waving goon squad

16:27.917 --> 16:30.386
were trying to ruin me
and everything I've built?

16:30.454 --> 16:32.421
You would have been
protected, Jonas.

16:32.489 --> 16:34.557
You and Starkwood.

16:34.624 --> 16:37.560
But you jeopardized
the plan.

16:37.627 --> 16:40.195
That bioweapon that you
developed for us was

16:40.263 --> 16:42.264
not intended for personal use.

16:42.332 --> 16:44.600
The consensus

16:44.668 --> 16:47.102
is that you've had
some sort of...

16:47.170 --> 16:49.104
psychotic break.

16:49.172 --> 16:52.107
Well, the consensus is wrong.

16:52.175 --> 16:54.377
Coming from you right now,
that's not much comfort.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.412
I want to talk to them.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.781
Get some form
of communication
between us.

16:58.849 --> 17:00.048
I want to talk to them.

17:00.116 --> 17:02.651
I think it's a little late
for that, Jonas.

17:02.719 --> 17:04.819
You've brought undue attention
by showing your hand.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.121
Exposing yourself.

17:06.189 --> 17:07.390
And I'm sure you
could understand

17:07.457 --> 17:08.624
their concern that you may,

17:08.692 --> 17:11.126
in fact, expose the others
as well.

17:11.194 --> 17:13.829
How can I do that?
I don't know who they are.

17:13.896 --> 17:16.131
You know enough,
and they need
to be certain.

17:16.199 --> 17:18.401
I think we can agree

17:18.468 --> 17:20.435
that there's no reason
for your family

17:20.503 --> 17:23.439
to pay for your
mistakes.

17:23.507 --> 17:25.107
Is that why you're here?

17:25.174 --> 17:26.442
To threaten my family.

17:26.510 --> 17:27.976
On the contrary.

17:28.044 --> 17:31.246
I came to guarantee your
family's safety.

17:31.314 --> 17:33.949
If you do the right thing.

17:38.855 --> 17:41.290
This will induce

17:41.357 --> 17:44.293
cardiac arrest, and leave
no trace in your system.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.463
A natural, dignified death.

17:47.531 --> 17:49.298
Without you to
prosecute,

17:49.365 --> 17:50.666
the case against
you and your

17:50.734 --> 17:53.602
company will be difficult,
likely impossible,

17:53.670 --> 17:55.938
preserving at least
some small part

17:56.005 --> 17:58.974
of Starkwood's legacy
of patriotic service.

17:59.042 --> 18:01.844
Which I know is very important
to you.

18:23.032 --> 18:24.700
Party's over,
counselor.

18:24.768 --> 18:26.234
We're moving him
to the Bureau.

18:26.302 --> 18:29.338
My client has invoked his right
to silence and to counsel.

18:29.405 --> 18:31.039
No one speaks to him

18:31.107 --> 18:33.041
unless in my presence,
is that understood?

18:33.109 --> 18:34.977
In some countries they'd
have shot him by now.

18:35.044 --> 18:37.079
Process him out.

18:49.893 --> 18:52.695
Step out of the cell
and raise your arms.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.165
Yes?

18:57.233 --> 18:58.400
I met with him.

18:58.468 --> 18:59.568
And?

18:59.636 --> 19:01.570
I'm quite certain
he understands our terms.

19:01.638 --> 19:03.572
They're transferring him
to the FBI for interrogation.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.773
Will that be
a problem?

19:04.841 --> 19:06.308
Hopefully, it'll just
pressure him

19:06.376 --> 19:08.310
to resolve the situation
sooner rather than later.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.546
I'll be happy
when this is behind us.

19:10.614 --> 19:12.080
Have you heard
from Almeida?

19:12.148 --> 19:14.082
He called in before
I met with Hodges.

19:14.150 --> 19:16.084
Has he secured
the canister?

19:16.152 --> 19:18.086
Soon.

19:18.154 --> 19:19.755
He's your guy.
Better not screw this up.

19:19.823 --> 19:23.859
Tony's been the one bright spot
in an otherwise dreary day.

19:23.927 --> 19:25.928
I have faith he'll come through.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.867
Yeah?

19:31.935 --> 19:33.602
I found a place to set up.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.437
It's an abandoned
apartment building

19:35.505 --> 19:36.772
just shy of the north
perimeter line.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.576
1297 Rincon,
corner of 12th.

19:40.644 --> 19:41.977
Yeah, I see it.

19:42.045 --> 19:44.312
Sweep teams are
just entering

19:44.380 --> 19:45.981
three sectors
to the south.

19:46.049 --> 19:47.650
You've got less
than 20 minutes.

19:47.717 --> 19:48.884
That doesn't give me much time.

19:48.952 --> 19:50.352
No, it doesn't,
so maybe you

19:50.420 --> 19:52.788
should get off
the phone and get to it.

20:32.862 --> 20:36.264
I lost two partners
in a row.

20:36.332 --> 20:38.467
Early on.

20:40.503 --> 20:42.504
I couldn't handle it.

20:45.108 --> 20:47.710
I guess that's why
over the last ten years,

20:47.777 --> 20:50.178
I've pretty much worked alone.

20:52.215 --> 20:54.382
It's all right
for you to be feeling

20:54.450 --> 20:56.885
what you feel.

20:56.953 --> 20:59.021
And if you can't
do this tonight,

20:59.089 --> 21:01.056
that's all right, too.

21:01.124 --> 21:02.390
Just don't try
and pretend

21:02.458 --> 21:05.060
like you're not feeling
anything.

21:05.128 --> 21:06.962
That's how you make a mistake.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.798
Please, Jack, don't
tell me what to feel

21:09.866 --> 21:11.734
and don't tell me
how to feel it.

21:31.955 --> 21:33.188
Agent Walker.

21:42.632 --> 21:44.633
He's over there.

21:47.937 --> 21:50.105
Jack!
Where is he?

21:50.173 --> 21:51.774
This way.
You okay?

21:51.841 --> 21:52.841
Yeah, I got lucky.

21:52.909 --> 21:54.342
The bullet went
straight through.

21:54.410 --> 21:55.778
Didn't think
I'd see you out here.

21:55.845 --> 21:57.846
I'm only here for
observation.

22:00.249 --> 22:03.251
You do not have
to do this.

22:04.754 --> 22:05.921
Show me.

22:39.475 --> 22:41.510
Cover him up.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.994
I'm sorry about Larry.

22:46.062 --> 22:47.930
How the hell did this happen?

22:47.997 --> 22:51.399
It all went down
pretty fast, I mean...

22:51.467 --> 22:54.169
We were ambushed before we
got out of the helicopter.

22:54.237 --> 22:57.272
The chopper pilot
was hit first.

22:57.340 --> 22:59.842
I was unarmed, so
Larry laid down cover

22:59.909 --> 23:01.844
so I could get clear.

23:01.911 --> 23:04.379
I don't remember a lot, but
I definitely heard auto-fire.

23:06.049 --> 23:07.883
As I was tagged,
Larry came over

23:07.951 --> 23:10.152
to help me out and
that's when he was hit.

23:11.187 --> 23:12.621
I blacked out after that.

23:12.688 --> 23:15.690
But I'm pretty sure Larry
saved my life.

23:15.759 --> 23:17.793
Larry was hit
with heavy ordnance.

23:17.861 --> 23:19.261
Shotgun rounds, armor piercing.

23:19.328 --> 23:21.029
You were obviously hit
with something smaller.

23:21.097 --> 23:22.597
- Jacketed.
- I treated Mr. Almeida.

23:22.665 --> 23:24.833
His wound was consistent
with a nine millimeter.

23:24.901 --> 23:26.835
You sure
it wasn't a .45?

23:26.903 --> 23:29.337
Not likely-- the entry
was too small. Why?

23:29.405 --> 23:32.374
Because you have spent
.45 casings in evidence.

23:32.441 --> 23:37.112
Galvez had access to the weapons
inside the FBI vehicle he stole.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.114
He probably switched
in the middle of the fight.

23:39.182 --> 23:40.649
That many weapons?

23:40.716 --> 23:42.617
In the time frame that
you described the ambush?

23:42.685 --> 23:44.019
It doesn't add up.

23:44.087 --> 23:46.989
Okay, so what
are you saying?
Someone was with him.

23:47.056 --> 23:50.458
Like I said, it all
happened pretty fast, but...

23:50.526 --> 23:52.227
I mean, I didn't
think so.

23:52.295 --> 23:55.798
I guess it makes sense.

23:55.865 --> 23:58.066
One man didn't do this alone.
He had help.

23:58.134 --> 24:01.203
I'll tell Park
to alert the field.

24:01.271 --> 24:03.205
You sure you're okay?

24:03.273 --> 24:05.007
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:05.074 --> 24:06.641
Good.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.917
Hello?

24:25.984 --> 24:27.451
Did I wake you?

24:27.519 --> 24:29.153
Who could sleep after
what happened today?

24:29.220 --> 24:30.955
How did it go with your father?

24:33.926 --> 24:35.893
Sweetheart, what is it?

24:35.961 --> 24:37.461
What happened?

24:38.496 --> 24:40.698
He's dying, Stephen.

24:40.766 --> 24:42.466
What?

24:42.534 --> 24:45.903
He was exposed to something.

24:45.971 --> 24:47.672
Like a biological agent.

24:47.739 --> 24:49.306
It had something
to do with the attacks

24:49.374 --> 24:51.008
that took place earlier today.

24:51.076 --> 24:55.046
Kim, honey, I'm so sorry.

24:55.113 --> 24:59.450
Um, isn't there anything
that they can do?

25:01.019 --> 25:02.853
No.

25:02.921 --> 25:04.622
I'm coming back home.

25:04.690 --> 25:06.323
Don't you want to stay?
Don't you wanna

25:06.391 --> 25:09.326
be with him as long as you can?

25:09.394 --> 25:11.328
My presence,

25:11.396 --> 25:12.897
with what he's
going through right now,

25:12.965 --> 25:14.665
will only make things worse.

25:14.733 --> 25:19.136
Did you at least, um,

25:19.204 --> 25:21.572
did you tell him about
his granddaughter?

25:25.010 --> 25:26.143
Kim?

25:26.211 --> 25:27.411
I couldn't, Stephen.

25:27.479 --> 25:29.146
I couldn't bring
myself to tell him

25:29.214 --> 25:32.717
I wasn't the only person
he was leaving behind.

25:32.784 --> 25:35.987
Telling him about Teri
would've only made it worse.

25:36.054 --> 25:38.522
I'm gonna try
and get on the 7:10.

25:38.590 --> 25:40.992
If I do, I'll be
back in L.A. by 9:00.

25:41.059 --> 25:42.326
Okay.

25:42.393 --> 25:45.195
You can always leave later,
if you change your mind.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.735
I love you both.

25:50.802 --> 25:53.370
We love you, too.

25:53.438 --> 25:55.439
Bye.

26:07.119 --> 26:09.020
Mobile Command,
this is Sweep 9.

26:09.087 --> 26:10.121
221 is clear.

26:10.188 --> 26:12.690
Copy, 9. Proceed to 224.

26:12.758 --> 26:16.226
Why has that area of the
grid not been cleared?

26:16.294 --> 26:18.195
Sweep 3, why have you
not cleared 219?

26:18.263 --> 26:19.830
Mobile Command, we're
encountering some resistance

26:19.898 --> 26:21.265
from neighborhood residents.

26:21.332 --> 26:23.034
They're not happy about
their homes being searched

26:23.101 --> 26:24.969
without a warrant
at 2:30 in the morning.

26:25.037 --> 26:26.871
I'm concerned about their
safety, not their happiness.

26:26.938 --> 26:29.106
Whoever is helping Galvez
may be providing him shelter

26:29.174 --> 26:31.208
in one of those houses.
If those civilians are

26:31.276 --> 26:33.077
interfering in that sweep,
arrest them, but get that

26:33.145 --> 26:34.444
area cleared.
Do you understand?

26:34.512 --> 26:36.446
Copy.

26:36.514 --> 26:37.748
Jack?

26:37.816 --> 26:39.083
Excuse me...

27:15.620 --> 27:17.621
It's an antiseizure medicine.

27:17.689 --> 27:20.224
I should've used
it earlier.

27:20.291 --> 27:21.992
Jack, what are you
doing out here?

27:22.060 --> 27:25.362
Why don't you go back to FBI
medical and let them treat you?

27:25.430 --> 27:27.965
There is no treatment.

27:28.033 --> 27:29.333
There's no cure.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.467
Wait.

27:32.337 --> 27:34.872
I'm sorry.

27:34.940 --> 27:36.273
I didn't know.

27:36.341 --> 27:38.209
Yeah.

27:38.276 --> 27:40.144
Why are you in the field?

27:40.212 --> 27:42.646
Agent Walker just lost
her partner, Tony.

27:45.416 --> 27:49.286
I thought I could help.
I owe her that much.

27:49.354 --> 27:51.856
Agent Stoller to Mobile Command.
Code Yellow.

27:51.923 --> 27:53.523
Go ahead, Agent Stoller,
this is Mobile Command.

27:53.591 --> 27:55.059
Are you reporting a Code Yellow?

27:55.127 --> 27:56.160
Affirmative.

27:56.228 --> 27:57.694
I have a confirmed visual

27:57.763 --> 27:59.130
on the target suspect

27:59.197 --> 28:00.530
with the canister.

28:00.598 --> 28:02.466
Repeat, confirmed visual

28:02.533 --> 28:04.301
of suspect and canister.

28:04.369 --> 28:06.703
Agent Park, may I?

28:06.772 --> 28:09.173
Agent Stoller,
this is Jack Bauer.

28:09.241 --> 28:12.076
Is Galvez with someone?

28:12.144 --> 28:13.343
Agent Stoller?

28:13.411 --> 28:15.545
Negative.
He's alone.

28:17.548 --> 28:18.715
Copy that.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.152
What's his 20?

28:21.219 --> 28:23.287
Entering an abandoned
apartment building

28:23.354 --> 28:24.822
on the south side

28:24.890 --> 28:26.690
of Rincon and 12th.

28:26.758 --> 28:27.892
I am in pursuit.

28:27.959 --> 28:29.726
Try to maintain a visual
and wait for backup.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.195
Do not engage
until we get there.

28:31.263 --> 28:32.963
Copy that.

28:33.031 --> 28:35.766
All primary units
respond to 12th and Rincon.

28:35.834 --> 28:37.067
Suspect sighted entering

28:37.135 --> 28:38.402
a building with canister.

28:38.469 --> 28:40.437
Code Yellow.
Agent Park?
I want a secure net

28:40.505 --> 28:43.174
around the building,
agents at all exits and I want

28:43.241 --> 28:45.309
sharpshooters covering each of
the four exposures.

28:45.376 --> 28:47.377
Yes, ma'am.

28:47.445 --> 28:48.712
Jack.

28:49.614 --> 28:51.415
I can't.

28:54.485 --> 28:57.087
It's all right, I'll be fine.

28:57.155 --> 28:58.789
I'll stay back,
I'll watch operations.

28:58.857 --> 29:00.724
You be careful out there.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.759
I still think Galvez
has a partner.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.829
You watch your back.

29:57.925 --> 29:59.727
"Hellfire."

29:59.794 --> 30:02.396
You served with the
27th in Pakistan.

30:02.464 --> 30:04.231
Two tours, sir.

30:04.298 --> 30:07.534
Did you, by any chance,
encounter any Starkwood units?

30:08.363 --> 30:10.230
There was a force
protection team

30:10.298 --> 30:12.232
attached by my C.O.

30:12.300 --> 30:13.367
They fought with you.

30:13.434 --> 30:15.235
Yes, sir.

30:15.303 --> 30:17.104
Side by side.

30:17.171 --> 30:18.205
Soldier...

30:20.141 --> 30:23.410
How would you rate
their professionalism?

30:23.477 --> 30:24.778
Their performance under fire.

30:29.650 --> 30:32.252
Thank you, son.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.787
Just made my day.

30:52.740 --> 30:54.207
All right, let's go.

31:02.350 --> 31:05.385
Our orders are
to deliver the prisoner

31:05.453 --> 31:07.020
to the rear entrance at FBI.

31:08.489 --> 31:10.123
The White House wants
to keep this low-key.

31:46.927 --> 31:48.362
Sarge!

32:00.741 --> 32:02.376
This is Sergeant Cadden.

32:02.443 --> 32:05.479
Prisoner's in severe cardiac
and respiratory distress.

32:05.546 --> 32:07.114
We are rerouting

32:07.181 --> 32:09.616
to West Arlington Hospital.

32:09.683 --> 32:12.486
Need emergency
medical team standing by!

32:13.154 --> 32:14.187
Go, go!

32:27.435 --> 32:28.801
Assemble the teams.
You got it.

32:28.869 --> 32:30.770
Agent Stoller, this is
Agent Walker, do you copy?

32:30.838 --> 32:31.871
I copy you, Agent Walker.

32:31.939 --> 32:33.173
What is your position?

32:33.241 --> 32:36.576
East stairwell between
the first and second floor.

32:36.644 --> 32:37.810
Suspect with canister

32:37.878 --> 32:39.312
has moved to the top floor.

32:39.380 --> 32:41.214
Do you have any indication
that he's not alone?

32:41.282 --> 32:42.749
Negative. Not at this time.

32:42.816 --> 32:44.551
All right, stand by.
We're coming to you.

32:44.618 --> 32:47.320
Agent Stoller puts the suspect
somewhere on the second floor.

32:47.388 --> 32:48.755
However, there's no guarantee

32:48.822 --> 32:50.657
that he's the only
hostile in the building.

32:50.724 --> 32:53.060
Therefore, we stick to SOP,
clearing room by room.

32:53.127 --> 32:54.894
Agent Park and I will lead
two teams, East and West.

32:54.962 --> 32:56.229
Check your weapons
and headsets.

32:56.297 --> 32:57.764
We move in 60 seconds.

32:57.831 --> 32:59.732
All right, you heard her,
you guys are with me...

32:59.800 --> 33:00.800
Mobile Command, this is Walker.

33:00.868 --> 33:02.202
Go ahead,
Agent Walker.

33:02.270 --> 33:03.636
We're about
to enter the building.

33:03.704 --> 33:06.039
Have HazMat teams on alert, in
case the canister gets breached.

33:06.107 --> 33:07.374
Copy that.

33:07.442 --> 33:08.508
How you holding up?

33:08.576 --> 33:09.776
Better, thanks.

33:17.085 --> 33:19.752
Excuse me.

33:19.820 --> 33:20.954
This is Bauer.

33:21.021 --> 33:22.956
Mr. Bauer,
this is Agent Mizelli.

33:23.023 --> 33:24.324
Sorry to bother
you with this,

33:24.392 --> 33:26.259
but I need to follow up on
something from our debrief.

33:26.327 --> 33:27.727
Agent, this isn't a good time.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.029
Some new information has come
to light, and I need

33:30.098 --> 33:32.265
to clear up a discrepancy.
What discrepancy?

33:32.333 --> 33:35.635
You told me Tony Almeida's
source on the White House attack

33:35.703 --> 33:38.238
was a man identified to you
as Vincent Cardiff?

33:38.306 --> 33:39.473
Yeah, that's right.

33:39.540 --> 33:42.409
Is there a possibility
you misremembered the name?

33:42.477 --> 33:43.443
No, I don't think so.

33:43.511 --> 33:44.444
Are you sure?

33:44.512 --> 33:45.579
You yourself have voiced some

33:45.646 --> 33:46.713
concern about your own acuity.

33:46.780 --> 33:48.448
Hold on.

33:48.516 --> 33:49.449
What is this here?

33:49.517 --> 33:50.617
Sir?

33:50.684 --> 33:51.818
Agent Mizelli, I'm
gonna have to get

33:51.885 --> 33:53.320
back to you.
Locator codes

33:53.387 --> 33:55.021
for all units'
radio transponders.

33:55.089 --> 33:56.556
Are they in real time?
Yes, sir.

33:56.624 --> 33:57.557
Can you do
a map overlay?

33:57.625 --> 33:58.658
It'll take a minute.
Get it done.

33:58.726 --> 34:00.727
What's going on, Jack?

34:00.794 --> 34:03.430
I'm not sure yet.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.985
Ready?
Now.

34:46.340 --> 34:48.141
Right there, there's
Stoller's transponder.

34:48.208 --> 34:49.842
He's not even
in the building.

34:49.909 --> 34:50.877
Agent Walker, this is Jack.

34:50.944 --> 34:52.279
Get your men out
of the building.

34:52.346 --> 34:53.780
It's a trap.
Jack, what?

34:53.847 --> 34:56.683
Stoller's not even in there.
Get your men out now.

34:56.750 --> 34:57.817
<i>Code Blue.</i>

34:57.885 --> 34:59.486
Repeat: Code Blue.

35:13.634 --> 35:16.369
Agent Walker, Agent Park!

35:16.437 --> 35:17.571
Get us a vehicle now!

35:17.638 --> 35:19.138
All perimeter teams,
this is Park.

35:19.207 --> 35:21.974
Agents are down.
Report to 12th and Rincon.

35:22.042 --> 35:23.142
We need assistance.

35:23.211 --> 35:24.678
Negative, negative,
disregard that order.

35:24.745 --> 35:25.712
Maintain your
positions.

35:25.779 --> 35:27.314
I repeat, maintain
your positions.

35:27.381 --> 35:28.748
Bauer, what the hell
are you doing?

35:28.816 --> 35:30.483
They are trying to pull you
off the line.

35:30.551 --> 35:31.818
You leave a hole
in that perimeter,

35:31.885 --> 35:33.220
we are going
to lose the canister.

35:33.287 --> 35:34.521
Tell your men to stand fast.

35:34.589 --> 35:35.722
Medivac is on its way.

35:35.789 --> 35:37.290
Get them in the air now!

36:10.612 --> 36:13.025
Jack, I'm going in.

36:13.050 --> 36:14.017
Agent Park.

36:14.085 --> 36:15.518
Agent Park.

36:15.586 --> 36:17.253
How many men
are unaccounted for?
Still assessing.

36:17.321 --> 36:18.989
There were at least 30
of us in the building

36:19.056 --> 36:20.790
when it went up.
And Agent Walker?

36:20.858 --> 36:22.926
I don't know.

36:22.994 --> 36:24.928
Renee, this is Jack.

36:24.996 --> 36:26.429
Do you copy?

36:26.497 --> 36:27.430
Renee, this is Jack.

36:27.498 --> 36:30.166
Do you copy?

36:30.234 --> 36:32.702
Damn it.

36:38.776 --> 36:40.777
Almeida.

36:42.613 --> 36:44.547
You got the canister?

36:44.615 --> 36:45.548
Yeah.

36:45.616 --> 36:46.616
Let me see.

36:51.588 --> 36:53.957
Hurry up, we need
to get moving.

37:02.099 --> 37:04.634
Let's go.

37:04.702 --> 37:06.703
Renee!

37:14.444 --> 37:17.147
Renee...

37:17.214 --> 37:18.882
Renee!
Jack.

37:18.949 --> 37:21.718
Are you okay?

37:21.786 --> 37:23.753
Yeah, but he's
not breathing.

37:23.821 --> 37:24.921
We need a medic!

37:29.827 --> 37:32.228
They've got him.
I want to get you out of here.

37:32.296 --> 37:34.698
Come on, let's go now.

37:40.671 --> 37:42.138
How'd you know
it was a trap?

37:42.206 --> 37:44.540
Stoller's transponder was
outside of the building.

37:44.608 --> 37:46.776
They were trying to thin
our ranks, create a diversion.

37:46.844 --> 37:47.877
Has the cordon
been breached?

37:47.945 --> 37:49.612
No, I told the men
to maintain their positions.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.714
The perimeter's secure.

37:50.781 --> 37:51.948
It's almost
like they knew, Jack.

37:52.016 --> 37:52.949
They would have needed time

37:53.017 --> 37:54.184
to wire this building
with explosives.

37:54.251 --> 37:56.152
This was the last sector
we were due to search.

37:56.220 --> 37:59.388
You think they knew
your sweep patterns?
They must have.

38:00.424 --> 38:01.357
Oh, my God.

38:01.425 --> 38:02.491
Jack, what is it?

38:02.559 --> 38:05.995
I'll meet you back
at your vehicle.

38:07.364 --> 38:09.265
Hey, you want me
to take him?

38:09.333 --> 38:10.333
No, I got him.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.702
They need your help inside.

38:18.042 --> 38:19.642
Agent Mizelli.

38:19.710 --> 38:21.978
This is Bauer. You said you
wanted to talk to me

38:22.046 --> 38:24.047
about Tony's suspect
Vincent Cardiff.

38:24.115 --> 38:25.782
Yes, yes, thanks for
getting back to me.

38:25.850 --> 38:27.617
Listen, uh, you told
me that he expired

38:27.684 --> 38:29.619
during the course of Tony
Almeida's interrogation.

38:29.686 --> 38:31.487
Yeah, that's what
Tony told me.

38:31.555 --> 38:32.688
Well, it
can't be him.

38:32.757 --> 38:33.790
What are you talking about?

38:33.858 --> 38:34.824
Vincent Cardiff was picked up

38:34.892 --> 38:36.159
over an hour ago by Customs,

38:36.227 --> 38:37.593
trying to cross
the border into Canada.

38:37.661 --> 38:39.162
Are you sure?

38:39.230 --> 38:41.030
Look, I'm positive, I've got
his arrest report right here.

38:41.098 --> 38:42.698
Cardiff's alive.

38:42.767 --> 38:43.699
Were there any signs

38:43.768 --> 38:44.934
from his interrogation--

38:45.002 --> 38:46.602
physical violence,
abuse, anything at all?

38:46.670 --> 38:47.871
Nothing's indicated
on the report.

38:47.938 --> 38:49.505
That's why I was asking if maybe

38:49.573 --> 38:51.307
you had mistaken
the name Almeida gave you.

38:59.483 --> 39:01.417
Here you go.

39:01.485 --> 39:02.986
Thanks.

39:03.053 --> 39:05.688
Tony!

39:10.227 --> 39:11.261
Tony!

39:13.097 --> 39:14.563
Yeah.

39:17.768 --> 39:19.502
We need to talk.

39:19.569 --> 39:20.870
Sure.

39:21.906 --> 39:24.274
What's going on?

39:27.477 --> 39:29.779
I told you earlier today,

39:29.847 --> 39:31.848
if you were lying to me
I'd kill you myself.

39:31.916 --> 39:33.883
What the hell
are you talking about?

39:33.951 --> 39:35.518
Cardiff, Vincent Cardiff--

39:35.585 --> 39:37.153
you said he was killed
during his interrogation.

39:37.221 --> 39:38.188
Yeah, so?

39:38.255 --> 39:40.589
He's alive and well, in custody,

39:40.657 --> 39:42.658
and he's showing no signs
of physical abuse.

39:42.726 --> 39:43.793
Explain that.

39:43.861 --> 39:47.931
All right, look,
Jack, I'm sorry.

39:47.998 --> 39:49.732
Cardiff knew
that by spilling that intel,

39:49.800 --> 39:51.367
he was going
to get himself killed,

39:51.435 --> 39:52.802
so I cut a
deal with him.

39:52.870 --> 39:55.038
I told him I'd
let the FBI think

39:55.105 --> 39:57.673
he was dead, so he could
walk away and disappear.

39:57.741 --> 39:59.309
I thought it was just
a meaningless lie.

39:59.376 --> 40:01.577
You and I have been doing this
long enough to know

40:01.645 --> 40:03.813
that there is no
such thing as a meaningless lie.

40:03.881 --> 40:04.981
How are you involved
in this?

40:05.049 --> 40:06.216
You're not making
any sense, Jack.

40:06.283 --> 40:07.616
That intel was good.

40:07.684 --> 40:09.152
Without it you'd have never
been in the White House

40:09.220 --> 40:10.153
to save the president.

40:10.221 --> 40:11.487
What is your involvement?!

40:12.589 --> 40:14.590
You're not thinking straight.

40:14.658 --> 40:16.659
How were you shot?

40:16.727 --> 40:19.262
Does Galvez even have
a second man...

40:19.330 --> 40:20.629
or was it just you?

40:20.697 --> 40:22.265
Just stop and listen
to what you're saying.

40:22.333 --> 40:24.234
It's insane. It's paranoia.

40:24.301 --> 40:26.069
Now, why don't you put
the gun down?

40:26.136 --> 40:28.637
Don't you move!

40:28.705 --> 40:31.074
The toxin is starting
to affect your judgment.

40:31.141 --> 40:33.676
That's what's happening.
You can see that, right?

40:51.595 --> 40:54.030
Is this what you're looking for?

40:56.733 --> 40:58.935
I never wanted
to hurt you, Jack.

41:00.404 --> 41:02.171
I told you to stay out of it.

41:02.239 --> 41:04.007
But you wouldn't listen,
would you?

41:04.074 --> 41:07.643
Can we get some help here?
This man's having a seizure.

41:07.711 --> 41:11.381
Stand back, please.

41:11.448 --> 41:13.682
Go get my bag
and call Dr. Mason, stat.

41:52.222 --> 41:54.357
I don't see anything.

41:54.425 --> 41:55.391
The wound must be posterior.

41:55.459 --> 41:58.361
Sir, I need to turn you
on your side.

42:08.038 --> 42:11.240
Put it down and
keep driving. Now!
