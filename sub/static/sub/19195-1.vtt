01:49.680 --> 01:50.954
Uh...

01:51.600 --> 01:54.353
Vinny went to
the wrong hotel.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.112
The wrong hotel?
Yeah.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.112
Motherfucker, how many Caesar
Palaces they got in Las Vegas?

01:59.200 --> 02:00.200
He'll be here!

02:00.280 --> 02:02.589
We are going to
start the weigh-in.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.989
If Pazienza is
not here by 7:00,

02:05.080 --> 02:06.718
he will be disqualified.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.270
Shit.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.033
Ash.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.234
Ash, answer the phone!

02:18.880 --> 02:20.313
Hello?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.038
Tell Vinny
they're going ahead.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.479
They're going ahead.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.056
Just hold them off.
Tell them I'm coming.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.115
He's coming.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.275
Where's he at?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.351
Where's he at?
He's on the fucking bicycle.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.176
No, dummy. His weight.
What fuckin' weight's he at?

02:31.200 --> 02:33.395
Where you at, Vinny?
I'm coming!

02:33.480 --> 02:35.118
He's coming.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.591
139 pounds
and three-quarters.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.789
Fuck.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.312
Tell Vinny that
Roger made weight.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.799
Where the fuck's
your boy?

02:45.160 --> 02:47.958
What are you so worried about?
Where the hell you have to be, anyway?

02:48.040 --> 02:50.838
Beating your pizza-faced,
Liberace-son back to Boston.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.878
Hey! Hey!
We're from Providence!

02:53.960 --> 02:56.997
He'll be here. He'll be here.
He'll be here.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.992
Don't you worry about that.
He's gonna be here. He's gonna be here.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.559
He gonna make it?

03:40.680 --> 03:42.591
Got a little
surprise for you.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.234
Get your motherfucking
dick out my face!

03:47.800 --> 03:49.472
He can't take
his eyes off me.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.318
He still looks big.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.311
This is gonna be close.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.751
140 pounds even.

04:10.840 --> 04:11.909
Yeah!

04:28.840 --> 04:31.149
Behind me,
the casino here at Caesar's,

04:31.280 --> 04:33.475
and, yes,
the eve of the big fight.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.439
Roger Mayweather defending
against Vinny Pazienza.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.670
For the WBC super
lightweight championship...

04:40.840 --> 04:41.856
Bottom line is
that I'm willing

04:41.880 --> 04:43.552
to die in that
ring tomorrow night.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.838
I don't think he's ready
to make that sacrifice.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.956
Damn straight. 'Cause
there ain 't no need to.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.270
Boy thinking about
dying instead of boxing.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.635
That should tell you
all you need to know.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.994
Motherfucker,
tomorrow night, you gone.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.071
I'm gonna rain on you
like a thunderstorm.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.309
Be scared.
Yeah.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.994
Do me a favor though, tomorrow
you get yourself a Tic Tac.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.536
And if you're this
close to me tomorrow,

05:06.560 --> 05:08.080
I'm gonna knock you the fuck out.
Okay.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.313
You all right, champ?

05:17.440 --> 05:18.873
Yeah, yeah.
I'm feeling good.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.120
Yeah.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.878
I know you are.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.191
You need anything?
Nah, I'm good.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.790
What you doing? You going to bed?
Yeah. Big day tomorrow.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.796
Hey, you should
hit the hay, too.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
Yeah, definitely, Pop.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.831
Okay, good night.
Good night.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.872
Ride the fever.
Wally Cleaver loves the beaver!

05:55.080 --> 05:56.559
Blow on those.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.952
Yeah!

05:59.040 --> 06:01.873
Baby. You're up 100K,
all right?

06:01.960 --> 06:03.313
Shouldn't you
just call it quits?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.436
Yeah, yeah.
Just order another OJ.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.794
I'm not thirsty.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.790
What are you doing here?
I'm splitting 10s.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.836
I mean,
don't you think you should be

06:17.920 --> 06:19.120
getting some
rest for tomorrow?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.475
It is tomorrow. Yeah, relax.
Just go ahead.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.438
Okay, yeah.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.354
I don't like this.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.870
Too many, too many! Yes!

06:38.000 --> 06:40.673
Baby, come on! Yeah, baby!
Vinny! Vinny!

06:40.760 --> 06:42.512
God, Vinny!

06:42.600 --> 06:44.989
Yeah. Yeah!
Too many!

06:45.080 --> 06:46.229
Boom!

06:46.480 --> 06:47.754
He's an animal.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.197
Who splits 10s
on a $20,000 hand?

07:03.600 --> 07:05.318
You shut up.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.797
Come on, Vinny!
Come on!

07:33.680 --> 07:35.989
Solid right hand
inside by Mayweather.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.310
Pazienza stopped
in his tracks.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.960
Got his attention
pretty good right there.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.679
What are you doing?
Get in there.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.496
- Solid right hand right on the eye!
- That hurt him.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.919
I question,
though,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.719
whether we'll ever see
Pazienza in the ring again

07:53.800 --> 07:56.394
after taking
a beating like this.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.277
That guy's
got a lot of heart.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.520
I'm telling you, he's got a lot of heart.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.873
More action after the bell.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.119
I can take that
all day!

08:07.240 --> 08:09.708
You got nothing!
Come on! Come on!

08:09.840 --> 08:11.558
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I'm fine.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.914
I got it. I got it.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.718
I got this. I got it.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.000
Darryl,
give us your score.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.230
Okay, I've got it to
eight rounds to three.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.510
107-101,
favor Roger Mayweather.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.960
I think he's winning the fight big,
and certainly the night.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.176
Good right hand right there.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.350
That was the best
right hand of the fight.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.111
Why let it go any further?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.549
Well, because he's a fighter.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.096
- Watch him finish the fight.
- Well, that's true.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.188
What's going on?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.429
Nothing, Ma.
He's still in his corner.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.936
I'm stopping that fight.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.235
I'm not waiting for a doctor
to make the decision.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.356
You're not
gonna win on points.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.398
You gotta knock him out. Vinny,
you gotta knock him out.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.153
Hey, champ.
Champ. You all right?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.880
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
You all right? Okay.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.430
You got this. You got this.
Now let's bury him!

09:04.400 --> 09:06.436
Two hands, Vinny!

09:07.640 --> 09:09.676
Oh, God.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.115
Look at his arms.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.713
You have ketosis.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.317
What does that mean?
I'm just dehydrated, Pop.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.433
We're in
the desert, Vinny.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.239
I see a lot of dehydration cases.
This isn't that.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.196
Doc, I've been doing it this way forever.
This is how it goes for me.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.430
Well, you can't keep
doing it like this.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.476
Yeah. Thank you, Doc.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.709
Appreciate it.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.949
It's weird, Ma.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.634
It's not weird.
Don't put too much salt.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.176
I'm not gonna put salt,
I'm putting parsley.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.760
If you hadn't
knocked this thing over...

10:37.240 --> 10:39.216
Would you stop crying about
the fucking elephant already?

10:39.240 --> 10:40.336
All right, there we go.
Honest.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.416
I'm just sayin',
I'm not crying.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.237
Hey, you want to
set the table, Jon?

10:43.320 --> 10:44.719
Sorry.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.154
Hey, Ma.
You watch the fight, yet?

10:48.240 --> 10:50.800
No. I can't
watch you get hurt.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.990
Yeah, well,
you know I don't get hurt.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.433
Where's the tape at?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.112
It's in the VCR.

10:59.720 --> 11:00.896
Can you put
that there, please?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.176
Well, will you move
this thing off the table?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.430
I can't do two
things at once, can I?

11:07.240 --> 11:10.198
The WBC super lightweight title.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.797
If "will" and "want to" alone
was all that mattered,

11:15.160 --> 11:19.438
Pazienza could beat this guy,
but "will" would only take you so far,

11:19.520 --> 11:22.273
unless you can bring
some skill along with it.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.830
That's called an old-fashioned
paintjob in Philadelphia.

11:28.120 --> 11:32.272
And for about the half-dozenth time,
they scrimmage after the bell.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.033
And Lou Duva goes
after Roger Mayweather.

11:35.120 --> 11:38.192
Now that's one of the silliest
things he could ever have done.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.794
Well,
Mayweather punched him!

11:41.600 --> 11:43.875
We're talking about
a guy in his 60s...

11:43.960 --> 11:45.678
Vinny, shut it off!

11:45.760 --> 11:48.911
We're eating.
Okay. I'm coming.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.736
How'd it feel to take
a shot from a world champ?

11:55.760 --> 11:57.591
He hits like
a altar boy.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.816
What do you think will be the
next move for Vinny after this fight?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.736
Next. I don't know if
there's gonna be a next.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.280
Now's not the time
for an announcement,

12:04.320 --> 12:08.791
but as far as I'm concerned,
Vinny Pazienza shouldn't fight no more.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.872
Now, boxing's been good to him
and he's been good to boxing,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.136
and that's
where it should end.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.559
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.072
I'm good. Vinny, darling,
come here.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.275
I'll have more.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.873
Ridiculous.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.376
Just be happy
with what you got.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.280
It's gonna fall out of her head now,
you know...

13:03.040 --> 13:04.758
Pop, stay calm,
all right?

13:04.840 --> 13:07.229
I need them to
set the next fight.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.270
Vinny, Angelo,
come on in.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.757
Angelo. Uh...

13:21.840 --> 13:23.319
What a surprise.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.549
How you doing, Vinny?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.795
They block
the driveway?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.158
We need to talk.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.376
You should have
called first.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.336
You know I don't like to
take meetings in the house.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.079
Yeah, and you should have thought
before opening your fucking mouth

13:34.160 --> 13:36.833
and telling the whole world
my son should retire.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.396
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, now, Lou. Let's talk.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.632
Come on.
Fine. Let's talk.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.236
Vinny ain't
done, Lou.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.871
And even if you think he is, you've
got no business announcing it on HBO.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.110
What the fuck.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.395
Vinny'll decide
when he's done.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.880
Well, I wish we'd spoken first,
but it's not a perfect world.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.718
It's fine. It's all right.
Lou, I need another fight.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.896
What's with
the deep fuckin' breath?

14:07.920 --> 14:09.831
You owe him another
fight on his contract.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.353
Pop.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.839
Lookit, Vinny.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.194
All I'm saying
is that

14:14.280 --> 14:17.041
I think maybe you ought to start
thinking about more important things.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.576
Your sister's getting married.
You should consider doing the same.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
Start a family.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.240
What the fuck does that have
to do with him fighting?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.320
Pop, please.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.056
Even when you win,
we end up in the hospital.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.719
Who's "we"?
I ain't never seen you there.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.315
Huh?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.550
Lou, for fuck's sake,
say something!

14:37.480 --> 14:41.268
You got heart, kid, but you
wear it on your fucking chin.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.755
I seriously think you ought
to consider hanging it up.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.957
I'm not done yet, all right?
I got more in me.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.918
That's not the problem.
You always got more.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.271
I'm begging you here, Lou.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.191
Give me another shot.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.993
Just one more.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.752
Fuck. Shit.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.754
Rough night?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.876
No. Great night.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.473
Rough morning.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.398
You're early.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.993
You're drunk.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.593
No, I'm hungover.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.716
There's a
huge difference.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.151
Well, you smell
like liquor.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.117
And you smell
like Rhode Island.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.952
What? You've never
had a big night before?

16:34.040 --> 16:35.712
No. I don't drink.

16:35.800 --> 16:36.869
Yeah?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.393
Good for you.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.920
Now, if we're done with the
fucking introductions...

16:41.000 --> 16:42.911
I can't see shit
out here.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.349
This is where you
trained Tyson, huh?

16:56.440 --> 16:57.589
Yeah.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
That is crazy.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.073
This your family?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.315
Yeah.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.237
You guys go
to Disneyland?

17:13.560 --> 17:15.550
World. In Orlando.

17:16.839 --> 17:18.955
Oh... Not yet.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.318
So, why did Tyson fire you?

17:24.280 --> 17:26.510
What?
Was it that DUI thing?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.995
What are you,
a newspaperman?

17:31.400 --> 17:32.799
Nah, I'm just asking.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.676
Do you not want
to be here?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.398
Yeah, I'm standing here,
aren't I?

17:39.480 --> 17:41.948
All right, listen.
Let's get real, Vinny.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.789
Yeah.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.073
You lost three in a row,
last one, a title fight,

17:49.160 --> 17:51.515
you got nothing lined up
'cause you're not a draw,

17:51.600 --> 17:55.718
your own manager, on fucking HBO,
said you should hang it up.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.712
The only reason
you're standing in my gym

17:58.800 --> 18:05.194
is because Lou sent you here
to put us both out to pasture.

18:08.200 --> 18:12.034
So, if you want to get this over
with, let's get it over with.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.553
You all set?
Yeah.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.710
All right.
This is Manny.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.313
How we doing?
How are you?

18:27.400 --> 18:28.753
You'll be sparring
with him today.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.114
Okay.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.511
How much you weigh?
190.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.831
You know that I fight
at junior welter, right?

18:35.920 --> 18:38.832
I know. Head-gear's in
the locker by the wall.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
Come on.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.199
That's enough!

19:12.640 --> 19:13.755
That's enough!

19:27.080 --> 19:28.911
Get on.
Why?

19:29.480 --> 19:32.278
What, "why"? Why not?
Gotta know where we're starting.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.391
I'm not in camp
or nothing.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.799
I haven't been training.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.679
Let's see.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.988
All right.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.834
There's no point.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.797
I'm gonna be way over.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.216
You just fought at 140 two weeks ago.
What, did you eat a horse?

19:52.240 --> 19:54.800
I told you,
I haven't been training.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.831
That's not what
I usually weigh.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.831
I'm not at my
fight weight right now.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.070
Hey, Vinny, I just
saw you use your weight.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.950
It wasn't
slowing you down. At all.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.478
Look, I don't need to cut corners, Kev.
I can make weight.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.834
No, maybe you're
at your weight.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.912
Cutting corners is
what you've been doing.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.240
I won my first
world title...

20:19.320 --> 20:20.320
As a lightweight, I know.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.760
The first time I got laid was
in my high school parking lot.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.917
You see me taking my wife there every
time I want to get my rocks off?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.513
Look at you.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.296
You're a different fighter,
your body's changed.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.390
You're bigger.
You hit with more power.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.313
You think I should
move up?

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
Eh...

20:38.440 --> 20:39.475
Welterweight?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.837
Junior middle?
Are you nuts?

20:44.920 --> 20:48.276
You're outta your head, Kev. Come on.
Nobody jumps two classes.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.112
That's...
No, no, that's a huge risk,

20:50.200 --> 20:52.216
which is the exact opposite
of what everybody tells me

20:52.240 --> 20:53.514
I should be doing
right now.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.432
It's a risk.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.792
This is The Clock.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.512
He's gonna teach you
how to move and time.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.396
Jesus Christ, Kev!
What's that thing made out of?

21:09.480 --> 21:10.754
Rock maple.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.434
And you don't get to hit
The Clock back yet, neither. Not yet.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.400
I only want you
to avoid him for now, all right?

21:17.640 --> 21:19.915
Bend your knees.
Move your head.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.600
Right, left.
Move your head. Left, right.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.671
Throw a punch,
you move your head.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.239
You look like
a two-by-four.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.990
No. Come on,
Vinny. Move your head.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.116
Come on.
Look at it. Anticipate it.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.839
No. Punch, move.
Punch, move.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.593
I got this. Come on.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.794
Here we go.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.240
That's it,
that's it, that's it.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.629
On the side,
sit down on it.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.038
Bad intentions.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.589
Bad intentions.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.198
Now you're moving.
Bend your knees.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.072
Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.229
Good.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.394
You're looking good now.
You're moving your head.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.909
All right, stop. Okay, Vinny, that's good.
Vinny, Vinny! Stop!

22:34.040 --> 22:35.040
What?
Stop.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.120
What?

22:43.120 --> 22:44.792
What is that?

22:44.920 --> 22:45.920
Huh?

22:46.240 --> 22:47.593
What?

22:47.720 --> 22:49.199
You fight the same way.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.117
It's like if you're
not completely spent,

22:51.240 --> 22:52.992
then you must not
have tried hard enough.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.176
Yeah. I don't mind the pain.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.872
Good, 'cause it's comin'.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.319
I'm sayin' you don't have
to send out invitations, you know?

22:59.440 --> 23:02.159
You can't brawl at this weight.
You have to box.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.400
You have to defend.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.472
Yeah, my offense
is my defense.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.074
Yeah? Where'd you
come up with that gem?

23:08.160 --> 23:10.390
Don Shula's autobiography?

23:10.480 --> 23:13.950
Listen to me, some hits you aren't
being tough by taking.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.470
So, when I say
"stop," you stop.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.156
You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.631
Put the plate down there.
You did a very good job.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.239
Everything's fine.
Everything's good.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.880
I think it looks lovely,
I do. I just...

23:43.480 --> 23:44.720
Your ma
religious, Vin?

23:44.840 --> 23:46.034
Yeah.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.153
What do you think, Kev?

23:51.960 --> 23:53.791
Spiritual.

23:55.240 --> 23:56.240
Yeah.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.595
Christ and elephants.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.512
Honey, you did so perfect.
The knife goes on that side.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.912
You made it.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.958
And honey, you look great. Great.
Thank you. Thanks.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.076
And, Ma, this is Kevin.
Mrs. Pazienza.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.280
Thank you for taking
such good care of my boy.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.856
Yeah. It's nothing.
I like your elephants.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.555
Oh, those are mine.
Yeah, I love elephants.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.432
Yeah. Hi,
I'm Vinny's sister, Doreen.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.590
And this is my
retarded fiancé, Jon.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.159
The fuck's wrong with you?

24:35.280 --> 24:36.759
Be quiet, all right?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.956
And this is...
Oh, yeah, I remember.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.115
Hi, Shelly.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.275
Actually, it's Heather.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.079
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, how are you?

24:43.160 --> 24:44.275
Hi, Mr. Pazienza.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.549
No. Angelo.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.868
Angelo. Nice to meet you.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.951
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, Pop.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.040
Champ.
Hey, how you doing?

24:51.080 --> 24:52.798
Jesus, you're huge.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.074
What are you at, 150?

24:54.240 --> 24:55.355
154.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.456
What are you doing?
No, it's a good thing. Trust me.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.675
Kevin knows what
he's doing. Yeah.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.736
What are we having for dinner?
I'm starving.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.016
All right,
everybody sit down. Come on.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.109
All right.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.952
Doreen, serve the salad.
Sorry. Sit down.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.952
Darling, here you go.
Yeah, there you go. That's right.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.429
You sit down.
No, I got it. I got it. Sit.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.078
Babe, you good?

25:13.240 --> 25:14.896
What else do you need?
No, no. I think I'm good.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.640
Everybody start with the salad.
All right...

25:21.560 --> 25:23.073
You settled in
all right?

25:23.160 --> 25:24.991
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.958
You got everything
you need?

25:28.040 --> 25:30.838
That mattress is brand new
that we put in for you.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.797
Oh, yeah?

25:33.120 --> 25:34.439
I'm good.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.154
So, let me ask you,

25:42.240 --> 25:44.993
who told you to come in here
with your missionary bullshit

25:45.080 --> 25:47.116
and change
the whole program?

25:48.040 --> 25:50.508
Behind my back no less.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.592
I mean, it wasn't a secret or nothin'.
If Vinny didn't tell you...

25:53.680 --> 25:55.796
I'll deal with Vinny.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.472
I'm talking to you.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.233
And I'm telling you that pushing
him up two weight classes

26:00.320 --> 26:02.311
is a dangerous
fucking move.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.517
How do you expect the Duvas
to find him a match?

26:07.680 --> 26:09.318
That's their job.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.588
Vinny made this decision,
Mr. Pazienza.

26:13.680 --> 26:16.056
I don't know why you're so worried
'cause he's a great fighter.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.469
Yeah, I know
he's a great fighter.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.198
He was a great fighter
before he met you.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.798
All right, you be first.
You be first.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.714
There you go.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.912
All right.
That's enough.

27:06.760 --> 27:07.988
That's enough.
You tired?

27:08.080 --> 27:09.149
No, no, I'm good.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.349
Let's go one more round.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.471
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny,
that's enough.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.197
- Kev...
- Don't "Kev" me. Come on.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.833
All right.
See you tomorrow.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.913
Hey, champ, Kev, my office.
Both of youse.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.839
All right.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.148
Sit.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.519
The fight came in.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.674
Hey.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.228
And it's a fucking
title bout.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.153
Are you serious?
Yeah.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.073
Who?
It's the French guy. Deal.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.997
Dele?
Yeah, Dele. Whatever.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.753
He's back in,
with a title fight!

27:58.400 --> 28:00.356
Kev, you hear that?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.671
I got a title fight.
I got a title fight, baby!

28:03.760 --> 28:05.910
Are you kidding me?
Come on! Hey, Vinny, Vinny.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.912
Get back to work.
Get back on your game!

28:09.040 --> 28:10.632
Come on! Yeah!

28:20.520 --> 28:22.840
It's bad enough that
you're promoting both fighters,

28:22.880 --> 28:24.359
but I know you
made a deal for Dele

28:24.480 --> 28:26.056
to fight Rossi in
Europe in three months.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.593
$250K.

28:28.120 --> 28:32.511
And we both know he's only worth that
much if it's a unifying title fight.

28:33.680 --> 28:34.749
You need Vinny to lose.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.952
It's worth just as
much to us if Vinny wins.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.959
We'll make
Dele-Rossi the under-card,

28:41.040 --> 28:43.759
put Vinny in the ring
with Sugar Ray or Duran.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.274
Duran!
That's a big fucking "if".

28:50.200 --> 28:52.475
Did you buy your
tickets to Italy yet?

28:52.680 --> 28:53.680
Huh?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.673
I bet you did.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.636
Nah. It's too soon.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.393
Forget using Vinny
as a stepping stone.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.596
You're making him
a fucking doormat.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.555
We had options at 140.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.751
At 154, our hands are tied.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.936
You said you wanted a fight.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.758
Yeah, a fight.
You're sending him to the lions.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.993
And I thought he was coming here
to bring us a bottle of champagne.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.679
I just talked to Angelo.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.479
It don't sound like nobody over
there is too upset. Just you.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.959
Go home, Kev.
Relax. This is good. For who?

29:28.200 --> 29:31.829
If you didn't finish his career in Vegas,
you're doing it now.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.313
We are?

29:34.400 --> 29:35.879
We were the ones
who asked for this?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.120
We were the ones who bumped
him up two weight classes?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.440
We were the ones who wanted
to make a big splash

29:41.520 --> 29:43.988
so that the world
could know Rooney's back.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.835
This is on you, Kev.

29:54.040 --> 29:57.555
Vinnie Pazienza is hoping
to find some stability and consistency

29:57.640 --> 30:00.200
at his new 154-pound home.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.316
Vinnie Pazienza has perhaps one last
shot to win a world championship

30:04.400 --> 30:07.437
when he takes on undefeated WBA
junior middle weight champ,

30:07.520 --> 30:08.953
Gilbert Dele.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.917
When Dele won
the title in February,

30:11.040 --> 30:12.917
he cold-cocked
a helpless opponent

30:13.040 --> 30:14.234
named Carlos Elliott.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.149
Elliott left on a stretcher,
face down, with a broken jaw.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.708
Well, good news is,
he hits like a girl.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.236
The Providence Civic Center.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.153
Fighting here has been one of
Vinny Pazienza's greatest dreams

30:27.240 --> 30:29.310
since becoming
a professional boxer.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.391
Well, it's no longer a dream.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.870
Coming up, Vinny Pazienza,
the homecoming.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.829
Gilbert is cool, nice.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.990
Well, you know,
he's a very fine guy.

30:42.080 --> 30:47.074
He's a fine guy, but he's a rough,
rough, rough guy.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.038
What does that mean?
Does he got rough hands?

30:50.160 --> 30:52.040
T ell you what, my mom owns
a salon in Cranston.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.000
He can go get a manicure,
if that's the problem.

30:59.920 --> 31:06.075
Gilbert says he can kick your Italian
ass in any country you like.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.229
Yeah? Well, not this one,
Gilbert, all right?

31:11.320 --> 31:12.958
You're stepping in
front of Providence,

31:13.120 --> 31:14.758
you're stepping in
front of my people,

31:14.840 --> 31:16.319
I've worked really
hard to get here.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.516
I'm not going anywhere
without that belt.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.357
He wishes you
the best of luck.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Come on.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.593
Come on, Kev, turn the music up.
I'm feeling good.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.592
I want you fresh for tomorrow.
Come on. All right. All right.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.749
Come on, Jon!

32:00.840 --> 32:03.080
What? He asked me to hold the bag.
You want me to say no?

32:06.840 --> 32:08.193
Come on, man.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.320
What?

32:10.520 --> 32:12.033
This fight...

32:13.440 --> 32:14.509
We gotta be careful.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.715
Yeah.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.336
Kev, you bumped me
up two weight classes,

32:17.360 --> 32:18.576
it's the night
before the fight,

32:18.600 --> 32:19.776
you're telling
me to be careful?

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
No kidding.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.336
Come on, what are you
doing right now?

32:26.360 --> 32:27.696
How is this
supposed to help anybody?

32:27.720 --> 32:30.234
I could ask you the same question.
It's 9:30.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.193
I mean, come on.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.395
Kev, look. I get it.
You need this win as much as I do.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.391
You're damn right
I need this win.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.155
But this isn't about me.
It's about you!

32:43.760 --> 32:45.193
You're all in.
All the time.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.032
Scares the shit outta me.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.119
What do you
want me to do?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.856
You want me to be half in?
Want me to be a quarter in?

32:50.880 --> 32:53.096
You want me to, like, smoke a
cigarette between rounds? What?

32:53.120 --> 32:56.317
I want you to understand the difference
between a risk and a gamble.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.879
Yeah. Risk, gambles,
whatever.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.313
No, not whatever.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.868
This, what we do here,
this is calculated, okay?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.355
We weigh the odds.
We make a choice.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.551
This ain't
blackjack, Vinny.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.432
It ain't orange juice
and tit-jobs and sunglasses.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.839
This is it.

33:16.480 --> 33:17.959
This is fucking it!

33:22.920 --> 33:25.070
Do you think I'm
going to lose this fight?

33:27.960 --> 33:29.439
No.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.711
Good. Me neither.

34:15.800 --> 34:19.076
They come from
opposite ends of the spectrum.

34:19.199 --> 34:23.795
Suave, smooth gentleman from Paris,
the champion, Gilbert Dele.

34:23.880 --> 34:28.192
Going up, the blue collar fighter
from Providence, Rhode Island,

34:28.280 --> 34:29.554
Vinny Pazienza.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.239
Sarah, come on,
it's starting any minute!

35:48.440 --> 35:49.589
Come on, champ!

35:49.960 --> 35:51.552
You be first, Vinny.
You be first!

35:51.760 --> 35:53.273
He's got...

36:00.040 --> 36:01.359
Go on, Vinny!

36:01.720 --> 36:03.039
Come on, let's go.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.869
Come on, Vin.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.509
Twist off the ropes!

36:25.960 --> 36:29.316
Dele nails Pazienza upstairs.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.550
Again, again!
Push off! Push off!

36:35.720 --> 36:37.711
Get off the ropes!
Twist off the ropes, Vinny!

36:38.600 --> 36:40.113
Come on, Vinny!
What are you doing?

36:46.680 --> 36:48.079
There you go.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
Vin...

36:57.600 --> 36:59.795
Doreen,
why are you so quiet?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.598
Come on! Come on!
The fuck is he doing?

37:07.640 --> 37:10.916
I've been here all day. I love it.
I can do this all day, baby.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.473
I'll see you
right after this.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.437
What are you doing, champ?
Stop playing around!

37:18.160 --> 37:19.195
Come on!

37:19.320 --> 37:20.355
Give me water.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.176
This wasn't
the game plan, all right?

37:24.200 --> 37:26.156
Why are you going
toe-to-toe with this guy, huh?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.479
Hey, Vinny, look at me.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.272
You don't move and you're gonna get hurt.
You're gonna get hurt!

37:39.040 --> 37:40.976
Don't let the feelings
get the better of you, okay?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.434
You don't have to slug
with this guy, all right?

37:45.440 --> 37:46.919
What?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.069
What is it?

37:48.200 --> 37:50.270
He doesn't hit
like a girl at all.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.112
Jesus Christ.

37:53.080 --> 37:55.150
He actually hits
pretty hard.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.312
Vinny, move your head,
all right? Come on!

37:58.400 --> 38:00.550
You kick his fucking ass!

38:08.320 --> 38:10.117
There you go!

38:18.800 --> 38:20.950
There you go! There you go!
Now you're moving!

38:29.800 --> 38:31.870
Yes, baby! Yes!

38:44.040 --> 38:46.395
Stay on him!
That's it. Yes!

38:48.880 --> 38:49.915
Come on!

39:03.080 --> 39:04.513
What are you doing, Vinny?
Come on!

39:08.920 --> 39:11.275
Come on, Vinny!
Come on, finish him off!

39:18.600 --> 39:20.160
This could end
in a knockout!

39:20.360 --> 39:21.429
Go to your corner.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.636
Ma! He did it!
Ma! He just did it!

39:40.760 --> 39:42.398
He knocked him out!
He knocked him out?

39:42.480 --> 39:43.480
Oh, my God!

39:51.720 --> 39:52.914
What are you doing?

39:53.600 --> 39:54.794
Vinny!

39:55.160 --> 39:56.275
Oh, my God!

39:56.600 --> 39:57.600
Whoo!

39:57.680 --> 39:59.079
Oh, my God,
he did it!

40:02.000 --> 40:03.256
You stuck it out, Vinny.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.159
I did it with dogged determination
and persistent perseverance.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.834
I'm back on top!
How do you feel, champ?

40:09.960 --> 40:13.475
I feel like I should be on a box of
Wheaties, doing a Gatorade commercial.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.677
I feel like I should be going to
Disneyland or something, I'm just...

40:16.800 --> 40:17.994
I'm so happy!

41:22.360 --> 41:24.555
So what?
You bulk up. No big deal.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.789
It's Duran.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.896
You'll have to fight
him super middleweight.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.478
Yeah, you think
I can handle him?

41:29.560 --> 41:31.994
I'd rather you fight
where you naturally live.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.799
I don't want you to have to
starve yourself or bulk up.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.916
But, yeah,
you can handle him.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.036
"Handle him"?
He's gonna murder him.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.839
You're too fucking nervous, Kevin.
You know that?

41:41.920 --> 41:43.194
Hey. You're not
nervous enough.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.509
Yo.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.755
Hey, you got it?

41:48.080 --> 41:49.877
She's outside.
Nice!

41:50.760 --> 41:52.159
Where you going?

41:52.280 --> 41:55.272
We're just going to Dunkin'.
Grab some coffee.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.360
All right.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.357
You be back for dinner.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.120
Yeah, well, he just
got this new car, Pops.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.718
So I might be
a little late for dinner.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.671
Does this mean
we're not going to AC?

42:24.760 --> 42:26.796
Nah. Gotta be back tonight.
Let's just do Foxwoods.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.233
All right.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.396
Hey, so did you
figure out your next fight?

42:30.480 --> 42:31.993
We're gonna skip
the rematch with Dele

42:32.120 --> 42:33.712
and go in straight
to something bigger.

42:33.800 --> 42:34.915
How big?

42:35.760 --> 42:36.795
Like Duran big.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.711
Holy shit. How much?
Jimmy!

43:29.040 --> 43:31.508
Vinny. Vinny. Vinny.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.315
Vinny.

43:34.440 --> 43:35.668
Fuck!

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
Hey.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.873
Hey! Call a
fucking ambulance!

43:53.400 --> 43:56.790
You see the way he hits now?
Like a fucking bull.

43:56.880 --> 43:58.199
Come on. Deal.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.557
You're so quiet tonight,
Anthony.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.551
I almost forgot
you were there.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.758
I came to play cards, not to hear
about your fucking kid all night.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.558
Yeah. Fuck you.

44:08.200 --> 44:11.272
Hey, Angelo,
Vinny's on TV!

44:11.360 --> 44:13.191
Jesus Christ already.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.634
Good evening.
Rhode Island's own Pazmanian Devil

44:16.720 --> 44:20.474
is in Kent County Memorial Hospital
tonight with a fractured neck.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.388
News Watch 10 has obtained
these photographs

44:23.480 --> 44:26.756
taken at the accident scene
not long after it happened.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.838
They show the car in which
Vinny Pazienza was riding

44:29.920 --> 44:31.148
as well as the other car...

44:31.680 --> 44:33.477
...here at Kent
County Hospital

44:33.600 --> 44:35.352
as friends and
family are gathering

44:35.440 --> 44:38.079
to see what actually
happened in the accident.

44:48.680 --> 44:50.033
Champ.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.033
Champ...
No, honey, he can't.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.471
They got him all drugged up
because he couldn't breathe.

45:02.120 --> 45:03.348
What happened to him?

45:04.760 --> 45:06.478
He got hit by a car.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.079
No, what happened to him?

45:12.760 --> 45:14.637
Angelo, sit down.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.514
Champ?

46:07.800 --> 46:10.314
Pop?
Yeah, I'm here.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.512
Pop?
Champ.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.028
Yeah?

46:17.120 --> 46:19.190
- Your breath is killing me.
- Oh!

46:20.120 --> 46:21.519
Thank you, God.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.953
How do you feel?

46:25.040 --> 46:27.270
Like I should be on
a box of Wheaties.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.028
Why am I in this thing?

46:42.960 --> 46:44.359
What?

46:46.160 --> 46:47.718
You were in an accident.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.033
Your neck's broke.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.992
What are you talking about?

46:52.680 --> 46:54.159
No, it's not.

46:58.480 --> 46:59.708
Pop, I...

47:01.040 --> 47:03.190
What are you talking about?
Ma, stop crying.

47:03.480 --> 47:04.833
I'm gonna get the doctor.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.233
I feel fine.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.993
You're not
fine, Vinny.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.834
The break on the C3 is less than an
eighth of an inch from your spinal cord.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.992
You don't need to be a radiologist
to see this is a problem.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.752
Vinny, you're
seriously injured.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.235
This is going to be
a long road to recovery.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.353
How much time?

47:25.440 --> 47:26.998
How much time, what?

47:27.080 --> 47:28.877
How much time until
I can fight again?

47:28.960 --> 47:29.960
Vinny.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.669
What?

47:32.360 --> 47:34.040
Doc, how much time
until I can fight again?

47:34.120 --> 47:36.056
Vinny, this is not the time
to be talking about this...

47:36.080 --> 47:37.593
Ma, please. Let him answer.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.714
I can't say with any certainty
you're going to walk again.

47:41.200 --> 47:44.033
What are you talking about?
I can feel everything.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.599
I feel fine, look.
Nurse...

47:45.680 --> 47:47.591
I'm moving my toes.
Look, I can feel that.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.272
Vinny, calm down.
Calm down.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.271
I feel all this stuff.
I can move everything.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.112
What are you talking about?
I can feel that.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.792
I feel that! I feel fine!
Vinny!

47:55.080 --> 47:56.433
Vinny! Vinny! Vinny!

47:56.600 --> 47:57.919
Vinny, it's all right.
It's okay.

47:58.040 --> 47:59.951
I feel fine, Doc.
You don't know... Stop.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.176
You got my arm right there.
What are you talking about?

48:02.200 --> 48:04.216
Okay. Kev, tell
them I'm going to fight again.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.275
You tell them!

48:05.960 --> 48:08.315
Kevin, just tell them...

48:26.280 --> 48:28.271
How you feeling, Vinny?
Fine.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.471
Listen, I want to talk to you one
more time about your options

48:32.600 --> 48:34.238
before we proceed tomorrow.

48:34.320 --> 48:36.151
No need.
Well...

48:36.600 --> 48:39.831
If I install the halo, there's
no guarantee that it will work.

48:39.920 --> 48:42.753
The halo relies solely on
your body healing on its own.

48:42.840 --> 48:45.070
Well, that's good,
because I heal fast.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.229
Not that fast.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.480
It'll be six months until
you're really out of danger.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.909
Until then,
one bump, one fall,

48:51.000 --> 48:53.992
any kind of movement and your
spinal cord could sever.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.496
Any doctor in the world
would be telling you

48:56.520 --> 48:59.751
that spinal fusion is really
the preferred procedure

48:59.840 --> 49:01.273
with this severe of an injury.

49:01.360 --> 49:04.750
You already told me all this.
You and my mom would get along great.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.033
If you let me
do the fusion,

49:07.480 --> 49:10.438
I can guarantee you'll
be able to walk again.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.193
That's not enough for me.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.480
I need to be
able to fight again.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.536
I need you to
understand the risks...

49:16.560 --> 49:18.039
I understand.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.871
I don't think you do.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.311
You're not fusing my neck.

49:33.560 --> 49:36.552
I want you to count
backwards from 10, Vinny.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.710
Didn't they tell
you I'm a boxer?

49:39.360 --> 49:42.033
Eight, seven... Not sure
if you know this, but...

49:42.840 --> 49:45.070
...six, five...

49:45.200 --> 49:47.475
Have you ever
been to Mexico...

49:47.560 --> 49:50.233
...three, two...

49:50.360 --> 49:52.157
Where's my mom?

50:28.960 --> 50:30.871
Okay.
Let's lift the head.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.794
Careful.
You okay?

51:58.360 --> 51:59.509
Come on. Come on.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.909
- There he is. There he is.
- Get out of here.

52:03.840 --> 52:06.195
Get out of here.
Come on, come on, get out of here.

52:10.360 --> 52:13.193
You're gonna get run over
by the car, come on.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.195
Nah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.120
Ow!

52:26.200 --> 52:27.394
Christ, you okay?

52:27.520 --> 52:29.988
Come on, let me help you!
Let me help you, for Christ's sake!

52:30.080 --> 52:32.196
Dad, get off me! Stop.

52:33.680 --> 52:35.352
Come on. Come on.

52:37.920 --> 52:39.353
All right.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.595
Yeah.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.995
Nah, I'm not getting
in that thing again.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.389
Come on...
Nah. Put it away.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.751
It's a...
It's a Craftmatic.

54:26.120 --> 54:28.998
We got your room all set
up down here in the den.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.912
Yeah, I saw that.

54:31.640 --> 54:33.240
Brought your posters
down and everything.

54:34.040 --> 54:35.359
Thanks, Jon.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.035
What do you need?
Where's the parm?

54:41.120 --> 54:42.439
I got it.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.875
Look, I appreciate what you guys
are doing, but I'm not a handicap.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.116
We left the wheelchair
in the car.

54:53.040 --> 54:56.112
We just want to make sure that
you don't hurt yourself, Vin.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.856
What are you trying to prove
getting up, anyways?

54:57.880 --> 54:59.632
I'm not trying to
prove anything, Doreen.

54:59.720 --> 55:01.656
If I would have asked you to
get me the parm a week ago,

55:01.680 --> 55:03.716
you would have told me
to go fuck myself. Hey!

55:04.840 --> 55:06.319
All right.
Yeah, that's fair.

55:07.400 --> 55:08.515
There's your parm.

55:09.040 --> 55:11.395
Vinny, I got two
color appointments,

55:11.520 --> 55:13.616
but I'm gonna come home
and make you lunch, all right?

55:13.640 --> 55:15.073
All right.
Okay.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.437
Get some rest, champ.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.635
I thought
the kids were gonna be...

55:44.240 --> 55:47.357
Just curious. You know, you
kind ofjust wonder about these things.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.590
Time may be running
out for the Red Sox. They may...

55:55.760 --> 55:58.069
You like that?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I do.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.351
Yeah, it's like a little jungle gym.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.272
Yeah, swing around on it.
Yeah?

56:02.400 --> 56:04.436
Go crazy.
I don't wanna hurt you.

56:04.560 --> 56:07.028
No, you're not gonna hurt me.
Hey!

56:07.120 --> 56:08.997
Give me a kiss.
Ow!

56:09.080 --> 56:11.275
What? Come on.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.199
Vin.
What?

56:16.280 --> 56:17.918
My fuckin' hair's caught

56:18.000 --> 56:19.911
in your fuckin' thing!
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Ow!

56:21.120 --> 56:22.872
Yeah, I got you.
It's fine.

56:22.960 --> 56:24.154
Look at my hair now!

56:24.280 --> 56:25.554
You look good. I'm sorry.

56:26.320 --> 56:28.311
No. I can't do this.

56:28.440 --> 56:31.591
Yeah, we don't have to kiss.
We'll figure something else out.

56:31.720 --> 56:33.376
- Where you going?
- Come here.

56:33.400 --> 56:34.549
Come here.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.715
You see, that's not nice.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.576
You can't just come over
here and tease me like that.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.397
Vinny...
You know I'm right.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.038
I gotta tell you...
Let it go. What?

56:42.160 --> 56:44.151
That thing, it's freaking me out.
Yeah?

56:44.600 --> 56:46.556
I don't know what
you want me to do.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.392
Call me when
it's like a sweater.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.277
Are you serious?
Yeah.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.672
You rest. You need to rest.
Yeah.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.433
Yeah, I know. I've rested plenty.
I need to not rest.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.591
Yeah, don't come back.
All right.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.591
You kiss me like that...

57:01.320 --> 57:02.469
Fuck.

57:46.080 --> 57:50.551
...for some time,
Midnight Madness became March Madness.

57:50.640 --> 57:53.393
Welcome to the Robin Hood
Basketball Redemption Tour.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.231
Hey, Kev. Hey.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.950
This is how you're
spending your birthday?

58:06.080 --> 58:07.399
Yeah, you know.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.836
Come on. Get dressed.
I'm taking you out.

58:11.480 --> 58:12.993
I don't wanna.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.399
Come on.

58:15.840 --> 58:16.909
Nah.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.393
Let's go. Come on.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.911
Let's go, come on!
We're gonna have fun tonight.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.514
We'll do the Elevator.
We'll do the Elevator.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.158
Look at that. Come on.

58:34.920 --> 58:37.115
God, Kev, you're scarring me.
Sit down.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.679
Come on. Come on.

58:38.800 --> 58:40.233
I can't unsee
what I just saw.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.072
Get up. There you go.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.879
Happy birthday, kid.
Hey, good to see you. Thank you.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.592
I almost forgot.

59:00.800 --> 59:02.677
All right, now hold on.
Yeah.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.199
All right, come on.

59:04.720 --> 59:05.835
There you go.

59:06.720 --> 59:08.256
Kev, come on.
What's with all the moping?

59:08.280 --> 59:10.271
Kev, come on.
Get me outta this thing!

59:10.800 --> 59:12.153
Loosen up.
My God.

59:12.280 --> 59:14.953
Why couldn't you
drive a minivan?

59:15.040 --> 59:16.234
God.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.195
All right.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.993
Hey, what... Why are we going here?
What?

59:21.160 --> 59:22.440
I'm gonna know
everybody in here.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.816
You're not gonna know anyone.
It's a Tuesday.

59:23.840 --> 59:25.956
Only skanks and
hoes work Tuesdays.

59:26.080 --> 59:27.308
Or you may know everyone.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.393
Surprise!

59:40.320 --> 59:41.389
Happy birthday!

59:45.040 --> 59:46.234
He had no idea!

59:46.840 --> 59:48.319
Then why is it
called an island?

59:48.400 --> 59:50.789
It's not an actual island,
it's named after an island.

59:50.880 --> 59:53.189
Rhodes.
Yes. The island of Rhodes.

59:53.360 --> 59:55.396
Yes. See?
Cape Cod. Nantucket.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.336
What are you talking about?
It has nothing to do with...

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.430
Here you are, champ!

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.919
This is it.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240
Huh?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.993
This is it.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.748
Vinny!

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240
Oh.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.512
Yeah.
Look at that.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.518
- Beautiful.
- Really nice.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.435
"WBA,
Junior Middleweight Champ."

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520
You are.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.953
All right.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.749
Yeah, thanks, guys.
It really means a lot to me.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.713
Everybody showing up here
and supporting me.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.998
I just want to say thank you,
it really means a lot.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.559
To Vinny!

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.032
Cheers!

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.995
All right!

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.872
This whole thing's
a machine.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.913
When the machine runs,
it feeds everybody.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.912
When it's down, when it ain't running,
nobody eats. You understand?

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.509
The machine,
it don't stop for nobody.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.319
Not for me, not for Don King,
not even for you.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.633
Now, we know you still have three
months to defend your title...

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.479
We're asking you to
give that up now, Vin.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.674
Defending your title in March
is just not a possibility.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.399
Sometimes you gotta cut your
losses to count your gains.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.993
Am I right?

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.631
You got your belt. Everybody
knows you're the champ.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.760
It ain't personal.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.908
Hey, happy birthday.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.880
Thanks.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.110
What'd those two
dumdums want from you?

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.269
Eh, nothing.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.591
Huh?
Nothing.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.114
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.474
What's up?

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.671
Hey, we're not
done here, Vinny.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.072
We're not?
No.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.232
We just need to figure out
what's next for you.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.474
There's a whole
world outside the ring.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.033
You know, Kev,

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.996
I'm getting pretty sick of people
talking about me like I'm dead.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.350
Like I died
in that car wreck.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.196
Like it's just over for me.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.151
Kev, I'm gonna fight again.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.832
No, you ain't, Vinny.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.230
That's what
everybody here knows,

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.550
but are afraid
to say it to your face.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.993
You're not gonna fight again.
It's over.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.192
You gotta let it go.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.069
Make sure my folks
get home all right.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.753
Twin River.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.196
Jesus, Vinny.
Hey.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.033
I know. And I can't even
park in the handicap spot.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.192
How you feeling, honey?
Uh, I'm feelin' good. Yeah.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.759
Thank you. You look good.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.400
Good to have you back, Mr. Pazienza.
Hey.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.435
Hey.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.113
Hey, guys, how we doing?

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.434
Hey. How are you?

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.756
I'm Vinny Paz. Yeah.
Oh, yeah?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.936
Can you take
this off the table?

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.234
Yeah. Sure.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.760
Twenty-two.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.470
Easy! Easy, Kev!
Easy, easy, easy!

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.000
Your cab's coming.
Stand right here.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.354
I don't want a cab!

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.096
Yeah, I know you don't,
but you're gonna get one.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.536
Just stand right here.
All right, all right!

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.960
I'm not gonna get in the car!
Kevin!

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.276
Stay away
from that car, Kevin!

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.035
Don't go in the car.
Kevin, don't do it!

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.838
You're right.
Come on back.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.553
Ah, Jesus Christ.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.073
Come on.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.993
Hit me.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.389
I'm sorry, Vinny.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.080
Come on.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.350
It's coming up
right up here.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.550
Vinny?
What?

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.835
What are you
doing down there?

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.199
I don't know.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.673
Come on, Pazman.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.679
Let's go.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.197
Fuck.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.029
Ah!

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.069
Let's go. Come on.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:28.912
Come on!

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:31.515
Come on, Vinny. Come on, Paz.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.229
Come on.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.188
Come on.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.638
Come on. Yeah.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.320
Come on, Paz.
Let's go, baby. Come on.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.310
Let him sleep.
He was probably up reading.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.718
Reading?

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.472
Why are you
this stupid?

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.153
Hey.
Hey.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.959
What you watching?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.031
Just watching
the fights a little bit.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.751
So, you get any
action at county or what?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.159
Fuck off.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.392
Jesus.
When did you get out?

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.152
Nah, I never went in.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.310
I got released
after 12 hours.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.591
I lost my license. On probation.
It's fucking stupid.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.880
Well, I'm glad you came over.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.389
Nah. I should have
come by sooner.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.536
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna say hi to your mom.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.836
Yeah, hold on. Let me talk to
you about something real quick.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.035
What?

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.519
I need your help.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.349
What happened?
You in trouble?

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.996
What, gambling?
You need money? What? No, no.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.672
No. None of that stuff.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.871
Vinny, come on.
What? Say it. Yeah, yeah.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.640
I know, I know.
I'm just going to show you.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.714
Vin, come on.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.030
What, did you buy
a new jean jacket?

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.429
I need you to start
training me again.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.632
Fuck you.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.429
Right?

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.275
Stop it.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.391
I'm serious.
I see that.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.800
Vinny, come on.
Sooner or later,

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.136
you got to start
accepting that maybe...

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.071
Look,
I already started, Kev.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.710
Started what?
With just the bar.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.795
Now, I've been
going real slow,

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.216
and I haven't rushed through anything,
just like you taught me...

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.800
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.
Whoa! Vinny, no!

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.114
No!
What?

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.798
What are you doing?
This is insane.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.910
You looked in
the mirror lately?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.991
You seen that
thing on your head?

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.753
Come on, you heard what the doctor said.
You're risking your life here.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.068
What life?

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.828
Upstairs?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.511
No, I can't do it.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.552
This is a fucking
Hail Mary at best.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.154
No it's...
No it's not. It's a gamble.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.352
Yeah, I know that.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.591
But, look, if there was a time to
roll the dice, this is it.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.800
I mean, you just
don't know how to give up.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.511
No, I do. Trust me, I do.
I know exactly how to give up.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.795
You know what scares
the shit out of me, Kev?

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.518
Is that it's easy.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.273
Something goes wrong and I'm involved,
I couldn't live with that.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.476
Doreen, it's your play.
Come on.

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.269
Doreen.
What?

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.475
It's your turn.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.312
I know it's my...
Give me a second.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.198
I gotta figure
out what I'm doing.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.440
- Doreen.
- What?

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.152
Come on, you're up.
Oh, my God.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.030
I know it's me.
I gotta figure out something to do.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.709
- Here, put this down there.
- You're awfully quiet tonight, Kevin.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.873
I'm fine, Mrs. Pazienza.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.558
It's your turn.
Yup.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.877
Isn't Vinny doing great?

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.238
He's doing great.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.148
What's this?

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.160
Kev, you think drinking is
such a good idea right now?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.389
You're gonna
lecture me on moderation?

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.911
The balls on this kid.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.672
Yeah. Since forever.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.511
All right, you know, Kevin,
you're welcome to stay here on the couch.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.776
You know, maybe you
shouldn't be driving.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.835
No, I'm fine.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.229
Ma, he can't drive.
He lost his license.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.509
Vinny.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.235
Louise?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.496
There we go.
Okay, I got my card.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.776
All right, Kevin, your turn.
Come on.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.869
Kevin, you're up.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.075
Come on.
I'm done.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.792
What do you mean?
No, no, no, no...

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.231
Kev, what are you doing?

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.474
Go upstairs.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.073
I'd love to.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.154
I don't think I can
make it up the stairs.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.913
Where's the bench press?

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.432
I threw it in the garbage.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.752
Why would you do that?

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.794
Leave it.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.238
You're a big dummy,
you know that?

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.832
Bench pressing.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.794
How is that a good idea?
You should be doing shoulder work.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.070
At least that will
help with your injury.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.034
This way, you're gonna just look like
some I-Tal on Venice Beach.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.319
You put me in a hell of a spot,
you know that?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.276
Had to decide if it'd be worse to watch
you kill yourself or help you do it.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.550
That's, like, the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.997
Sit down, asshole.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.636
There you go.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.040
There you go.
Straighten up the back.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.311
You get cable with that thing?
Yeah.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.878
Is this making
too much noise?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.672
Nah. We're good.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.829
Come on.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.755
Vinny?
Vinny, I got to get the Christmas box.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.149
Kev, get that box
right there. Yeah, Ma!

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.595
Kev's bringing
it up to you.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.896
There you go, Mrs. Pazienza.
All right.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.275
Yeah, he's got it.
All right. Thank you.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.958
What are you two
doing down there?

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.998
We're just going through
some of Vinny's old tapes.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.114
Ten more.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.800
Come on.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.190
Come on, you're not
even counting. Five.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.353
There. How do you feel?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.589
Good? All right.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.198
Hey, what happened to you?

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.113
Oh, yeah, yeah, I slipped coming
out of the bathroom yesterday.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080
Peppers.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.400
- Peppers are good.
- All right, darling.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.273
One day you're fighting
and calling each other names,

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.976
now you're giggling
like a bunch of school girls.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.831
What the hell's
the matter with you two?

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.200
I don't know.
I don't know, Pops.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.456
Just having
a good day, I guess.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.471
Yeah?
Well, knock it off.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.149
So, you don't mind the
construction site on his face?

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.633
Construction
doesn't last forever.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.277
You know,
I'm actually kind of into it.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.032
It's like braces times 1,000.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.190
I think this
might be the one, Vin.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:59.034
That's it.
I told you.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.628
Come on, do it again.
Baby, come on.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.159
Oh, my God.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.598
Hey...

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.272
Get out of my house.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.838
You've been training under
my roof without telling me.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.560
Pop, listen...
Right under my fucking nose.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.830
You been doing
this the whole time?

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.988
Yeah.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.560
It's been the only thing that's kept
me alive these last few months.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.388
You lied to me, Vinny.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.948
I lied to you?
Where were you tonight?

01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.996
The fuck did you
just say to me?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.878
I'm sorry, Pop.
I didn't want you to worry.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.696
Vinny.
What are you doing?

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.153
We gotta get
the show on the road.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.117
Yeah, I know.
I told her I'm good.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.277
You have to be given a sedative
for me to remove the screws.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.556
Nah. Let's just do it.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.950
Vinny. I can't do this without
giving you an anesthetic.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.856
Listen to me, Doc...
It would be excruciatingly painful.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.456
Okay, listen to me, Doc. I've never
done drugs in my life, all right?

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.358
I've never taken a hit, not a bump,
not a drag on a joint.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.749
Nothing. So, I'm not
gonna start now.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.871
Just take 'em out.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.319
You ready?

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.435
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.318
Holy shit, Doc.
You're going the wrong way!

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.112
I'm not, Vinny.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.475
Listen...
Are you sure?

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.318
It feels like you're
screwing it deeper!

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.320
What do you say we
give you a sedative?

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.630
No, I'm good.
Come on. I'm good.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.955
Shit, Doc! It's leftie-loosey!
Do you know what you're doing?

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.832
Yes. I know. Thank you.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.918
It's the calcification around
the threads breaking free.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.309
It's like a rusty
bolt with Loctite on it.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.149
Okay.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.792
All right. Let's go.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120
Ah, fuck.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.838
Okay. Breathe.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.600
Oof!

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:39.028
Okay, there we go.
There we go. All right. Okay.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.359
Piece of cake.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.040
Whoo.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.039
Okay. Got it.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920
There you go.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.554
Come on.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.714
Hey.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.512
I think I'm gonna be all right.
Yeah?

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.953
Yeah.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.752
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.736
- Thank you so much for helping out.
- You're welcome.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.716
- Hey.
- I so appreciate it.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.392
Thanks, Doc.
Thank you. Yeah.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.277
Thank you, Doc.
Let's go.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.599
Fuck me.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.799
Good. Good.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.839
How's that weight?

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.188
All right?

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.976
Sorry, Vinny,
it's impossible.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.070
I can't get anyone
to issue a fight.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.879
Listen to me, Lou. I've been busting
my ass over here, all right?

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.320
Only one thing
got me through that.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.589
Come on.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.033
I don't care
who it's with,

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.792
where it happens,
how much money it's for.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.154
None of that.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.750
I made the calls, Vinny.
No one will fight you.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.673
No one wants to be the one to
send you back to the hospital.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.536
I don't want to be
the one to say it...

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.879
Then don't.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.513
Because I worked
too hard to hear it.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.153
Vinny...

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.830
...tonight, any shot of
catching the Yankees,

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.354
the Red Sox play three in
Detroit starting tonight.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.398
And let's face it, at six back,
they need a minor miracle,

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.239
probably a major miracle
to win this wildcard race.

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.536
All right. Thanks, Jo.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.552
The dream lives on, Vinny Paz
anxiously awaiting the chance

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.875
to once again
pursue his boxing dream.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.589
In the meantime, the Pazman is doing
all he can to keep his body in shape

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680
as we discovered today.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.256
There was always something ironic

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.998
about seeing
the Pazmanian Devil

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080
wearing a halo.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.953
But the irony is gone,
replaced by iron.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.429
Vinny Pazienza is
pumping iron again...

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.599
Hey.
Hey.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:16.640
What did you do?

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.910
Hey. I didn't know
it was gonna get this crazy.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.031
Come on.
We'll make it work. Let's go.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.720
Whoa.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.958
Hey, everybody,
how are we doing?

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.508
Vinny,
how you feeling? Hey, Vinny.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.238
Good to see you guys.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.670
Getting that right there?
All right, Vinny. Come on.

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.936
Okay, thank you, guys.
Go get changed.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.096
Really, really appreciate it.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.560
Give them a little show.
Okay.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.477
All right.
The champ is here.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.256
Hey, Vinny,
how you feeling?

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.960
How am I feeling? I'm feeling like
a two-time world champion, Nicky.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:52.234
I feel like
I'm moving faster, hitting stronger.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.916
Looking good.
When's the next fight?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.434
Uh, I don't know, but it's going to be...
It's gonna be huge.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.976
All right. What's your
weight class gonna be?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.116
Uh, super heavyweight.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.936
I don't know. It's a good question.
Kev keeps fattening me up.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.296
Can we get some
footage of you in the ring?

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.912
It'd be great for this piece.
Yeah.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.558
No.
Hey, love to, guys,

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.359
but we didn't set up a sparring
partner for today's work, all right?

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.908
Kev, you guys wanna see me spar?
Yeah!

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.235
You guys wanna
see me spar? Come on.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.470
Kev, seriously,
find somebody. I'm fine.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.272
And they said I'd never walk again,
said I'd never box again.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.271
Hey, Dino.
Go a couple of rounds?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.353
What do you mean "no"?

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.628
Here I am, six months later.
Had screws in my head. I got these scars.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.278
Chicks dig scars though,
right, Cindy?

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.275
Jose.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.909
Hey, time flies.
Jose, let's go. Get in the ring.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.996
Coming at his head.
Come on. Come on.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.638
Kev, how we doing?

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.957
I don't know, Vinny.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.355
Yeah.
What?

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.233
What, nobody wants to
spar with me?

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.958
Let's do it another day...
No. Come on.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.080
Hey, Tommy. Come here.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.039
Tommy, I need you
to spar with me.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.832
Nah. I can't.
Why?

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.519
I just can't.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.189
Come on.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.079
Tommy.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.071
What, nobody wants to
spar with me?

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.915
Hey. I'll spar with you.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.395
Yeah? Good.
You're doing a good thing. Yeah.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.433
- How tall are you?
- Like, six foot.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.391
Oh, my God,
you are huge.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.069
Come on.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.750
Wait. What are you doing,
man? Let's go.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Come on.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.836
Come on.
What are you doing? Hit me!

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.148
I... I can't hit you, man.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.560
Come on,
we're not dancing, bitch!

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.992
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240
Shit.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.712
Are you okay?

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.751
Yeah, I'm good.
Thank you.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.996
Okay.
All right, champ. Way to go.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.196
If all goes well at the
doctor's office on the 14th,

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.113
it won't be long until Vinny's
back here in the ring

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.835
bobbing and weaving and sparring
his way to fighting form.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.714
As one of the most courageous comebacks
in boxing history continues.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.110
The familiar desire and
determination are still there.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.117
The halo that's got
a whole new appreciation...

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.753
I can sell this.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.640
Come on.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.273
This is too soon.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.556
Is this Ma?
No.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.039
I mean, yeah,
we talked about it,

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.078
but how many times you think
we had that conversation?

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.635
No, this is different.
This is me.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.311
You don't think I'm ready?

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.350
I think you're
in great shape.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.038
Then what is it?

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.838
This whole thing.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.959
The accident.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.193
It woke me up.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.838
I got a taste of
what it'd be like if...

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.599
Yeah, Pop.
That's what it did for me.

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.159
I got a taste.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.114
When I was lying
on the cot,

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.439
that's all I was
thinking about, was,

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.239
"What am I gonna
do after this?"

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.033
Am I gonna train
kids at the gym?

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.230
You know,
bartend at night?

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.829
Talk about how I used to be a fighter,
used to be world champ?

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.031
No, this is what I do.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.189
And I don't know
how not to do it.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.309
Okay.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.516
Look, I know you think I've been
doing a bang-up job all these years,

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.909
but that ain't exactly true.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.793
I let you put yourself
in harm's way.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.552
I... I pushed you to it.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.954
No, you didn't.
No, I did.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.952
No, you didn't do it.
I did! All right?

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:22.079
And I know it's a little late
to be making a change,

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.792
but...
What change?

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.395
I can't be in your
corner for this one.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.231
Or any of them.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.676
I can't be part of you
getting hurt no more.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.188
Why are you
doing this right now?

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.794
I should have done
it a long time ago.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.920
All right.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.790
Vinny! You got a second?

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.399
Yeah. What's up, Lou?

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.792
I got a hell of
an offer for you.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.416
Look, I told you I don't need a hell
of an offer, I just need a fight.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.998
Under-promise, over-deliver.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.235
Here comes the good news.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.696
Okay, first off,
we've been trying

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.056
to get you
a fight this whole time.

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.216
Obviously the recent
press coverage...

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.240
Save it, Dan.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:18.632
What are you bringing us, Lou?
Roberto Duran.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.395
IBC World Super
Middleweight Title.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.756
1.6 million dollars.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.589
Biggest payday
of your career.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.598
So, we're good?

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.313
I mean, it's up to...
You know, up to Kev.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.597
1.6 million...

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.354
Let's get it on.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.509
Yeah, let's get it on!

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.195
- All right. Let's get a fight.
- Come on.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.469
Come on.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:02.960
Come on...

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.056
Vinny was the man,

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.435
the junior middleweight
champion of the world.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:20.672
When a brutal car accident left him
inches away from complete paralysis,

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.030
doctors said he'd
never box again.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.176
And the doctors told him,

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.776
"You'll never even walk again,
let alone fight."

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.631
He said "No, Doc,
I'm gonna fight!"

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.016
Doctor says,
"You're crazy, you can't even walk."

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.032
It's a fascinating story.
Vinny Pazienza.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.559
Say hello to him.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.716
Pazienza, Pazienza!

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.154
Oh, my God!
Look at him.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.154
Oh, he looks so handsome.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.231
You broke your neck,
obviously.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.496
I see you wearing
that brace there.

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.000
Then what?
The doctors told you, what,

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.040
you'd never even walk again,
let alone fight again?

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.436
Never fight again, but now
I'm about to fight Roberto Duran.

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.676
June 25th at
the MGM on pay-per-view.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.536
We're a little
bit more than 48 hours away

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.473
from the showdown in Las Vegas between
Vinny Pazienza and Roberto Duran.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.677
Duran's record, 93-9,
64 knockouts.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.197
It's scheduled for 12 rounds,
and it should be one heck of a fight.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.358
Twelve rounds of boxing

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.797
for the IBC Super
Middleweight Title!

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.197
Tonight's main
event is sanctioned

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.236
by the Nevada
Athletic Commission

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.630
and the honorable
Governor Bob Miller.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.680
First,
introducing the principals.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.475
Boxing out of the blue corner,
wearing the red trunks,

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.354
weighing in at
an even 165 pounds.

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.355
From Cranston, Rhode Island,

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.712
this man is a former two-time
world champion!

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.839
The Pazmanian Devil!

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.111
Vinny Pazienza!

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.837
And his opponent,
boxing out of the red corner.

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.679
This man needs
no introduction.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.637
Wearing the black trunks
with a solid gold trim,

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:06.159
he weighed in at a fit and
fighting-ready 165 and a half pounds.

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.873
93 wins with 64
coming by knockout.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.353
He's a four-time
world champion.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.073
El hijo de la
República de Panamá.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:25.594
From Panama City, Panamá,
Manos de Piedras,

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.477
the Hands of Stone,

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:34.678
Roberto Duran!

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.429
These are dramatic
moments for Vinny Pazienza.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.755
He has made it back
from a broken neck.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.758
Doctors telling him
he might never walk again.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.757
He wore the halo
for six months.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.395
The metal brace screwed into
his skull in four spots.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.195
That he's standing in this ring
is a minor miracle in itself!

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.816
That and the fact that
he's jumped three weight classes

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.239
from where he won
his first title.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.032
That makes this
a long shot at best.

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.376
All right, gentlemen, you know the rules.
I'm addressing them.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.118
I want a good, clean fight.

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.357
Obey my commands at all times
and protect yourselves.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.237
Now, tap gloves,
and come out fighting.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.280
And what is
on everyone's mind is,

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.391
"Will the neck of
Pazienza hold up

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.636
"at a 12-round
championship fight?"

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.512
He's only
sparred up until now.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.956
And these are,
after all, the Hands of Stone

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.991
coming at him tonight.

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.393
Angelo Pazienza is
not in Vinny's corner tonight

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.552
for the first time in
his son's boxing career.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.115
Come on.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.117
And down goes Pazienza!

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.838
He took a huge shot
on that damaged neck!

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.152
Duran putting Pazienza
on the canvas in round one!

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.635
Four,

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.469
five, six...

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.797
Pazienza refuses
to take the entire count.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.440
Not wise but
certainly consistent.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:47.798
How are you
feeling? Huh?

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.108
You gave him a free shot.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.474
How's the neck?

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.629
I'm good.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.776
Every time he's
looking at that left hook,

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.552
you're under,
back with a left one, okay?

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.433
Move! You're bigger, you're stronger,
you're faster, all right?

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.272
The guy can't even move!

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.920
Everything off the jab.
Everything off the jab, all right?

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.917
Put your punches together.
Let's go! Okay.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.708
All right.

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.034
Go kill him.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.336
You can see it already.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:25.558
Pazienza's moving well, but Duran's
catching Vinny on the way in.

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.033
He can't even get close.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.520
Combination by Duran!

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.035
Move your head, Vinny!
Move your head!

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.193
Oh, God.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.951
Vinny, what are you doing?
Keep your hands up!

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.195
Give me defense!

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.836
Good combination by Pazienza!

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.876
Right hand from Duran!

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.955
Duran with the big right hand!

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.320
Come on, Vinny! Why are you
going toe-to-toe with him?

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.790
And it's all Duran
here in the early going.

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.237
Don't slug
with this guy.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.751
You're a better boxer.
Everything off the jab.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.998
On to round four.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.799
It's been all Roberto Duran.
Good right hand there by Pazienza.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.911
There you go!
Follow it up! Follow it up!

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.913
Keep moving!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.114
Pazienza's shaken by
the right hand delivered by Duran.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.474
Use the ring!
Use the ring, damn it!

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.749
What's he doing?

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.755
I can't watch this.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.319
Come on! Jab!

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.917
Roberto Duran
taking this fight over.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.274
Watch out for the hook!
Watch out for the hook!

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.560
Every single time,
he's looking

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.993
for that left hook,
I told you.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.957
I want you to move
away from it, all right?

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.193
...as Pazienza tries to
get his rhythm going in this fight.

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.195
Call it.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:38.831
Call the fight,
for Christ's sake.

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.755
Not yet.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.115
Come on!
He's dyin' out there!

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.675
Go sit down.

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.390
Relax, relax,
relax, relax. Huh?

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.239
Take a breath.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.033
What'd my dad say?

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.040
It don't matter what
he said, all right? I can't...

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.632
Hey, Vin, listen to me. Hey!

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.016
If he didn't think you could
win this fight without him,

01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.871
he'd be here
in the corner, okay?

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.353
Vinny, we started
this in a basement.

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.595
In a fucking basement!

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.200
Now, go out there
and show me how you do things.

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.551
Show me how you live.

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.518
Show me how you fight.

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.080
Want me to show you
how I fight?

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.789
Yeah.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.639
Show me who
the fuck you are.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.558
Again, Pazienza
backed into the corner.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.078
Duran misses!

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.913
Big overhand
right from Pazienza!

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.072
There you go, there you go!

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.070
Move! Move!
Move! You got him, Vinny!

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:20.631
There you go! Get him! Come on!
Get him! Get him!

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.194
Through the body, Vinny.

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.793
Give him a 5-6, 5-6!

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.776
Pazienza turning
things around... There you go.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.800
...in the 7th round.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.832
5-5-1, Vinny.
5-5-1! Go big!

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.718
Come on, kid.
Listen to me.

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.911
That's how you fight. Huh?

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.672
That's how you box!

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.277
You're a fucking
animal, Vinny!

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.954
What a round
for Vinny Pazienza!

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.477
And now, this is
the Pazienza we've seen before!

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.520
The brawling, powerful Pazienza!

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.030
Pazienza laying
through the pit of Duran.

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:02.313
You hear them? Yeah!
Yeah.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:05.108
You got him! Go!

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.315
Pazienza with a wicked
shot to the side of Duran's head!

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:13.272
These are huge moments
for Vinny Pazienza!

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.430
Lovely combinations!

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.959
Do the jab,
nice, Vinny!

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.176
Pull it together!
Pull it together!

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.919
Left hand
planted by Pazienza!

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.310
Another left by Pazienza.
And a win by Pazienza!

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:30.435
...I don't think any of us
thought we were going to be here now.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.876
A wild 11th round with Pazienza
making what looks like

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.155
an improbable
comeback in this fight.

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.993
It is a
street fight at this point.

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.832
Pazienza
does not look good.

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.871
He is bleeding
from everywhere.

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.995
If Vinny Pazienza came in with
one plan, he's got another now.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.309
Last round. All in, Vinny!

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:55.231
All fucking in, you hear me?

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.155
Now finish it!

01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.196
That's what you do best.
You finish, all right?

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.037
Three minutes,
you're champion of the world.

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.191
Three minutes.
Three minutes.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.075
Let's go.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.949
And here we go
with the final round.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:18.718
Round 12!

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.511
Come on, Vinny!
You got this guy! Come on...

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.896
Beautiful combination
by Pazienza. Come on!

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.056
Move your feet, Vinny!
Move your feet! There you go!

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.197
Pazienza's stumbling
following a right hand by Duran!

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.216
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny...

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.798
Come on!

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.397
This crowd
that was booing Vinny Pazienza

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.637
from moments early in
the fight, on its feet!

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:04.074
Come on, this is it!
This is it!

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.109
Come on!

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:13.398
I cannot believe
they're both still standing!

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.433
Come on, Vinny!

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.153
And it's all over!

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.791
Goes the distance.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.517
And it's in
the hands of the judges.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.392
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.758
after 12 action-packed
championship rounds of boxing,

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.799
I give you the scoring
by the judges as follows.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:06.078
Judge Chuck Giampa
scores the bout 114-114.

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:12.952
Judge Dave Moretti and Judge Jerry
Roth both score the bout 115-113

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.393
for the winner,

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.913
and IBC Super Middleweight
Champion of the World,

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.791
Vinny, the Pazmanian Devil!

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.675
Oh, my God!

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:53.240
People are calling this one of the most
unlikely comebacks in sports history.

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.231
What do you
attribute it to?

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.320
Um...

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.796
Yeah, I don't know.
I had a lot of help.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.756
But you've also had
a lot of adversity.

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.470
You've had issues with management,
conflicts of interest...

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.233
Yeah, well, the boxing world
looks shiny from the outside.

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.076
It's filled with
promises that...

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:19.156
Most of them
turn out to be lies.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.071
You can't rely on anyone.

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:26.197
So, what would you say
the biggest deception was?

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.151
What was the biggest lie
you were told?

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.316
It's not that simple.

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.438
Why not?

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.193
No, that's the biggest
lie I was ever told.

01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.111
"It's not that simple."

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.152
And it's a lie they tell you
over and over again.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.832
What's not simple?

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.793
Any of it.

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.159
All of it.

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:58.073
It's how they
get you to give up.

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.118
They say, "It's not
that simple, Vinny."

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.191
So, what's the truth?

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.833
That it is.

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:14.915
That if you just do the thing
that they tell you, you can't,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.513
then it's done.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.029
And you realize
it is that simple.

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.436
And that it always was.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.470
I feel like I should be
on a box of Wheaties tomorrow,

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:27.791
doing Gatorade commercials,
going to Disneyland.

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.035
I'm just so happy!

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:32.709
'Cause no one in the history
of sports, to my knowledge,

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.870
has ever come back
from this type of injury.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.039
I didn't want him to box. I wanted
him to be... Anything but boxing.

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:40.519
He's a fighter.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.114
And a fighter,
you don't make fighters.

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.077
Vinny's a born fighter.

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:48.594
Lou Duva's
looking at suspension.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.833
That's not professional.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:01.714
And Dr. Cotter had a tear in his eye.
I could tell he felt for me.

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.793
And he said, "Son, I'm sorry to
say you're not gonna box again."

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:10.792
And I looked at him,
and I said, "No, Dr. Cotter. You're wrong.

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.717
"I am gonna box again."

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.598
I said, "You don't understand
what kind of man I am."

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:35.638
This halo portion goes
around the person's head,

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:40.071
and is placed
much like this.

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:44.990
It's held in place
by these rather

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:48.516
medieval devices
called screws...

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.136
This fight was for
the people of Rhode Island,

01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.976
and it was for the believers
that believed in me.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.673
I think you all came out.
For the believers, I want to thank you.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.394
And I proved something to you.
I wanted to make you people proud.

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.829
And for the non-believers,
I just want to tell you,

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:11.198
it's time to realize that the Pazmanian
Devil is no fictitious character.
