00:00.125 --> 00:02.160
Sergeant David Budd,
Metropolitan Police.

00:02.200 --> 00:04.119
British Transport Police
have put out an alert

00:04.160 --> 00:05.304
on a possible suicide bomber

00:05.359 --> 00:07.710
attempting to
board a London-bound service.

00:08.848 --> 00:11.847
Don't do that, please don't do that!
Please, just stay still, stay still!

00:11.888 --> 00:15.247
The man that was in here before -
is that your husband?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.296
And your husband wants you to die?

00:19.893 --> 00:22.508
I can't see any
justification for believing

00:22.549 --> 00:25.549
the Taliban would govern Afghanistan
in peace and harmony,

00:25.589 --> 00:29.149
or Iraqi insurgents would ever have
formed a stable democracy.

00:29.189 --> 00:31.949
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

00:33.109 --> 00:35.949
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

00:40.589 --> 00:43.002
I know you'll never let
anything bad happen to me.

00:44.149 --> 00:44.952
You said it...

00:44.993 --> 00:45.869
out in Helmand.

00:45.909 --> 00:48.429
If you ever found yourself right
beside one of those bastards

00:48.469 --> 00:49.709
that sent us out there,

00:49.749 --> 00:52.869
you'd just close your eyes
and pull the trigger.

00:52.909 --> 00:54.189
Armed police!

00:54.229 --> 00:55.869
You've got to finish the job.

01:00.989 --> 01:03.749
Whatever your training has made you,
it's out of control.

01:03.789 --> 01:05.349
No, I'm-I'm fine, Julia!

01:05.388 --> 01:07.229
No! You are far from fine.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.949
We've taken the liberty of
providing you with a tablet

01:10.989 --> 01:13.109
so the material can't be traced to
your own devices.

01:13.149 --> 01:15.069
I need to ask you to
identify yourself.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.709
Richard Longcross.

01:18.669 --> 01:21.349
They're feeding her intelligence
they're keeping from us!

01:21.389 --> 01:22.509
What is she up to?

01:22.549 --> 01:24.269
You need to find out.

01:24.309 --> 01:24.909
Julia?

01:24.950 --> 01:26.669
- Prime Minister.
- This is unexpected.

01:26.709 --> 01:28.629
Julia's snatching the key
to No 10.

01:28.669 --> 01:30.949
We need to do something... fast.

01:30.989 --> 01:32.909
Who the hell does she think she is?

01:32.949 --> 01:34.789
Do you want a plan put in place?

01:36.869 --> 01:40.629
I want you right beside me,
not because it's your job,

01:40.669 --> 01:42.149
but because it's our choice.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.709
If you fulfil your engagement at
St Matthew's,

01:44.749 --> 01:46.549
you'd get the exposure you need.

01:46.589 --> 01:48.629
I'm sure the police would take
a different view.

01:48.669 --> 01:51.989
This is a very,
very dangerous politician.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.429
Someone who must be stopped.

01:57.189 --> 01:58.549
What do you want?

01:59.709 --> 02:01.309
You see anyone out there?

02:01.349 --> 02:02.589
No.

02:02.629 --> 02:04.669
Stay put.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.469
- What's in the briefcase?
- Research files.

02:06.509 --> 02:07.789
Show me.

02:10.989 --> 02:13.377
- Everything OK, skipper?
- False alarm.

02:22.549 --> 02:24.709
The Home Secretary,
Julia Montague,

02:24.749 --> 02:27.429
was among those injured in
the blast at St Matthew's College.

02:27.469 --> 02:29.669
I heard there were security
breaches from the word go.

02:29.709 --> 02:30.989
What the hell happened?

02:31.029 --> 02:33.109
A search team swept
the auditorium twice.

02:33.149 --> 02:35.429
- Everything was clear.
- Well, it wasn't, was it?!

02:35.469 --> 02:38.229
After today's incident,
we can't rule out a connection.

02:38.269 --> 02:41.469
Suggesting the gunman
had at least one accomplice.

02:48.309 --> 02:51.469
<i>...All inquiries
are being referred to Downing Street</i>

02:51.509 --> 02:54.389
<i>but so far No 10 have made no
official statement except...</i>

03:08.029 --> 03:11.669
<i>...To stay away from the Bloomsbury
area of London.</i>

03:13.469 --> 03:15.749
<i>...We're also being advised by
hospital officials that</i>

03:15.789 --> 03:18.229
<i>Ms Montague is currently undergoing
major surgery...</i>

03:18.269 --> 03:19.909
DCI Sharma.

03:21.036 --> 03:24.309
<i>The Metropolitan Police
is on high alert across London,</i>

03:24.349 --> 03:27.189
<i>with all off-duty officers
being called in to help</i>

03:27.229 --> 03:31.429
<i>with urgent identifying and
rounding up accomplices.</i>

03:31.469 --> 03:33.589
<i>Trauma call, ETA 15 minutes.</i>

03:41.749 --> 03:43.069
PC Tom Fenton?

03:43.109 --> 03:45.309
DCI Deepak Sharma, SO15.

03:45.349 --> 03:48.469
Sir. Sorry this is crap timing,
mate, but I was trying to form

03:48.509 --> 03:50.869
a picture of the events
surrounding the explosion.

03:50.926 --> 03:53.469
Witnesses have already told us
one of your Principal's aides,

03:53.509 --> 03:55.549
Tahir Mahmood,
appeared at the side of the stage,

03:55.589 --> 03:57.466
and that he was carrying
a briefcase?

03:58.989 --> 04:01.629
I didn't have eyes on
that myself, sir.

04:01.669 --> 04:03.389
Well, what about afterwards?

04:03.429 --> 04:04.869
Anything from Mahmood?

04:05.018 --> 04:07.138
No, sir, he died instantly.

04:07.849 --> 04:10.769
What do you recall about the final
moments before the explosion?

04:12.549 --> 04:13.919
Kim...

04:14.976 --> 04:18.176
PC Knowles...
She approached the stage.

04:19.309 --> 04:21.749
That's when the device went off.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.958
I was looking towards PS Budd,
to get a...

04:25.561 --> 04:27.356
...a steer on what was going on.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.208
What about Budd?

04:29.549 --> 04:32.747
I'm a bit in the dark on that, sir.
He left the auditorium and...

04:33.349 --> 04:35.509
...when he came back in,
that's when...

04:35.549 --> 04:37.309
...Mahmood appeared on the stage.

04:37.349 --> 04:38.869
What was Budd doing outside?

04:38.909 --> 04:40.269
I don't know, sir.

04:40.504 --> 04:42.984
That's unusual, though, isn't it?
More than a coincidence?

04:46.029 --> 04:47.669
I'm so sorry, sir.

04:48.869 --> 04:52.029
Look, before you go off duty, I need
you to write up a first account.

04:52.069 --> 04:54.029
Everything you can remember.

04:54.069 --> 04:55.109
Everything.

04:56.309 --> 04:57.469
OK, sir.

04:58.669 --> 04:59.763
Thanks.

05:00.669 --> 05:03.949
<i>Amid the profound
sense of shock here tonight,</i>

05:03.989 --> 05:07.949
<i>two big straightforward questions
are being asked.</i>

05:07.989 --> 05:12.629
<i>First, was Julia Montague
the intended target of his attack?</i>

05:12.669 --> 05:15.749
<i>And second,
was she just moments away</i>

05:15.789 --> 05:19.029
<i>from launching a bid
to take over No 10?</i>

05:19.069 --> 05:20.629
<i>On that first question,</i>

05:20.669 --> 05:23.269
<i>the answer is,
we simply do not know.</i>

05:23.552 --> 05:24.909
<i>On the second,</i>

05:24.949 --> 05:28.629
<i>well, for many months there have
been deepening divisions</i>

05:28.669 --> 05:30.589
<i>between her and the Prime Minister,</i>

05:30.629 --> 05:33.989
<i>the two at odds over
their approach to security,</i>

05:34.029 --> 05:37.309
<i>with the Home Secretary pushing
a more hard-line stance...</i>

05:37.349 --> 05:37.869
Sarge...

05:37.923 --> 05:39.482
<i>with the controversial
Bill RIPA-18.</i>

05:39.523 --> 05:40.480
Boss!

05:40.887 --> 05:42.234
Over here.

05:45.069 --> 05:47.869
All the TV cameras were trained on
the Home Secretary.

05:47.909 --> 05:50.869
We have this wider view
from a CCTV camera.

06:03.469 --> 06:05.789
Show us frame by frame
on the explosion.

06:16.389 --> 06:18.789
From this angle, it's unclear
if the explosion originated

06:18.829 --> 06:19.949
from the briefcase.

06:19.989 --> 06:21.403
You've shared this
with Fort Halstead?

06:21.444 --> 06:22.033
Yeah.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.698
One for them to figure out.

06:24.113 --> 06:25.168
Ta.

06:27.789 --> 06:29.149
You got a location on Budd?

06:29.189 --> 06:32.749
On it, sir. Then we'll get him
straight in for a statement.

06:32.789 --> 06:34.869
Not just yet.

06:48.229 --> 06:50.429
- In the concealed files. 
- Sarge!

06:50.469 --> 06:51.509
David!

06:53.669 --> 06:55.989
- What's going on?
- We're tracking communications

06:56.029 --> 06:57.989
involving the Home Secretary's
inner circle -

06:58.029 --> 06:59.389
in case they were compromised.

06:59.429 --> 07:00.429
OK...

07:00.469 --> 07:03.069
We're looking for anything
that might help us.

07:03.109 --> 07:05.949
Are you OK to consent to us
taking all of your phones,

07:05.989 --> 07:08.989
computers and any other relevant
devices you've been using for work?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.269
Uh... And it would be a big help

07:11.309 --> 07:14.349
if we could also search
your address, please.

07:14.389 --> 07:17.509
It's... not a POLSA search
or anything that detailed.

07:17.549 --> 07:19.189
Sure, anything to help, huh?

07:30.149 --> 07:31.909
Cheers.

07:31.949 --> 07:33.709
And the phone.

07:40.549 --> 07:41.589
Ta.

07:42.509 --> 07:43.869
Right, let's get on with it.

07:53.669 --> 07:57.109
Bag up that computer and any other
devices he has lying around.

08:13.269 --> 08:14.469
Sarge!

08:16.869 --> 08:18.309
Open it up.

09:03.156 --> 09:05.359
Mind if we crack on while
everything's still fresh?

09:05.520 --> 09:06.303
Sir.

09:06.344 --> 09:09.469
One of your CPOs, Tom Fenton, has
provided us with a first account.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.989
Fenton was on duty with you
and PC Kimberley Knowles during

09:12.029 --> 09:14.269
- the Home Secretary's speech?
- That's correct.

09:14.309 --> 09:16.949
Fenton recalled you and PC Knowles
left the auditorium

09:16.989 --> 09:18.789
a short time before the explosion.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.069
Yes. Why?

09:21.909 --> 09:25.029
I, uh... saw someone outside
the auditorium,

09:25.069 --> 09:27.909
- I went to investigate.
- Someone acting suspiciously?

09:27.949 --> 09:29.549
That's what I went to investigate.

09:29.589 --> 09:30.989
Who was this person?

09:34.389 --> 09:36.029
What does Kim say?

09:38.429 --> 09:39.589
What?

09:39.629 --> 09:41.909
I'm... sorry, David, um...

09:43.829 --> 09:46.309
Kimberly appears to have been
very close by the stage

09:46.349 --> 09:48.189
when the device went off.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.749
She died of her injuries.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.389
Look, mate, you know
how important this might be.

10:04.269 --> 10:05.869
Who was it?

10:14.549 --> 10:16.109
Tahir Mahmood.

10:24.109 --> 10:26.309
In what way was he
behaving suspiciously?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.669
He wasn't. 
Or I'd have detained him.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.949
So what was he up to?

10:33.989 --> 10:36.909
He needed to get information
to the Home Secretary.

10:36.949 --> 10:40.109
- He was looking for backstage access.
- That's unusual, isn't it?

10:42.389 --> 10:44.749
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, a big speech.

10:44.789 --> 10:47.709
Some flunky arsing about on stage
kind of ruins the image, doesn't it?

10:49.629 --> 10:51.029
It's like I said - it's not my area.

10:51.069 --> 10:54.469
Witnesses report Tahir Mahmood
was carrying a briefcase.

10:56.149 --> 10:57.269
Yes.

10:57.309 --> 10:59.109
He showed me the contents.

11:00.749 --> 11:02.029
Home Office documents.

11:02.069 --> 11:04.029
How thoroughly did you
examine the briefcase?

11:07.029 --> 11:08.669
I inspected the contents.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.229
Inspected?

11:12.629 --> 11:14.549
I looked inside.

11:14.589 --> 11:16.429
Documents.

11:16.469 --> 11:18.109
Nothing else.

11:18.149 --> 11:19.789
Did you search Mahmood?

11:20.749 --> 11:23.509
If I saw grounds under Stop and
Search, I'd have searched him.

11:23.549 --> 11:26.669
He was a vetted Government aide
going about official business.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.429
So, you didn't search him?

11:29.549 --> 11:30.669
No.

11:33.149 --> 11:36.069
Some of the witnesses are
informing us that the explosion

11:36.109 --> 11:37.869
originated from the briefcase.

11:47.989 --> 11:50.469
We've got these video
captures of CCTV

11:50.509 --> 11:53.229
in the seconds before the attack.

11:53.269 --> 11:55.589
As you can see,
Knowles approached the stage.

11:59.229 --> 12:00.949
Yes.

12:00.989 --> 12:03.109
Looks like she's alarmed
that Mahmood was up there.

12:05.149 --> 12:06.749
- That's possible...
- And here's you.

12:08.389 --> 12:10.429
Not so quick on the uptake.

12:10.469 --> 12:12.829
Like I said,
I didn't think he posed a threat.

12:14.469 --> 12:16.789
Why did you say, "What did Kim say?"

12:24.469 --> 12:26.349
You were the officer in command.

12:28.309 --> 12:30.389
You could've ordered him
to be removed.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.229
This is the second attempt
on the Home Secretary's life.

12:40.269 --> 12:42.909
Following the Thornton Circus 
sniper attack.

12:42.949 --> 12:45.269
Both times, you were the PPO.

12:45.309 --> 12:48.789
The officer in charge of
the Home Secretary's protection.

12:48.829 --> 12:50.109
Yes, sir.

12:51.109 --> 12:53.549
Either you've got rotten luck, mate,
or it's a coincidence.

12:55.269 --> 12:58.389
- Yes, sir.
- I don't believe in coincidences.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.989
I can't help you there, sir.

13:05.189 --> 13:07.029
Maybe you can help me
with something else.

13:08.149 --> 13:09.789
Why the Home Secretary?

13:13.429 --> 13:15.669
- Sir?
- Not the Prime Minister?

13:15.709 --> 13:16.949
Or a softer target.

13:16.989 --> 13:19.509
You join her protection team
and we've got Thornton Circus,

13:19.549 --> 13:21.629
we've got St Matthew's College -
what's going on?

13:24.149 --> 13:27.629
The Home Secretary has been
the Government's most...

13:27.669 --> 13:30.389
...visible spokesperson
for national security

13:30.429 --> 13:32.349
since well before I was her PPO.

13:38.789 --> 13:40.229
Louise.

13:41.789 --> 13:44.589
Thank you for providing
access to your devices.

13:44.629 --> 13:47.589
We've only had time for
an initial examination.

13:47.629 --> 13:50.069
Now, there appears
to be occasions...

13:50.109 --> 13:52.069
...when you turned off
your mobile phone.

13:56.389 --> 13:57.709
Why is that, David?

14:00.029 --> 14:02.189
To not be disturbed.

14:02.229 --> 14:03.709
Save battery.

14:03.749 --> 14:06.509
You're aware the effect is
to deactivate the phone's GPS

14:06.549 --> 14:08.062
so your movements
can't be tracked?

14:08.103 --> 14:09.029
That's not the reason.

14:09.069 --> 14:10.509
You also carried out a search

14:10.549 --> 14:13.269
on the Home Secretary's
parliamentary voting record.

14:13.309 --> 14:14.989
Yeah, why was that, David?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.269
Curiosity.

14:18.709 --> 14:22.429
Your duty's to protect a politician,
regardless of their policies.

14:22.469 --> 14:24.429
What were you curious about?

14:25.989 --> 14:27.629
Nothing in particular.

14:35.349 --> 14:36.469
David...

14:37.629 --> 14:39.309
Tell me something.

14:40.869 --> 14:43.349
Why did you abscond
from the hospital?

14:43.389 --> 14:45.109
Abscond?

14:45.149 --> 14:46.509
No, sir.

14:47.909 --> 14:49.509
I was with the Home Secretary.

14:51.509 --> 14:54.109
Government officials arrived.

14:54.149 --> 14:56.349
I was ordered to give them privacy.

14:56.389 --> 14:57.829
You just walked out?

14:57.869 --> 15:00.309
Didn't report back to your unit,
didn't provide a statement.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.229
Louise had to track you down.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.389
Not hard, sir, was it?

15:04.429 --> 15:05.509
I went home.

15:05.549 --> 15:08.429
Why weren't you assisting
the inquiry?

15:08.469 --> 15:09.629
I just wanted to be alone.

15:09.669 --> 15:12.789
An inquiry into an act of terror
perpetrated by someone

15:12.829 --> 15:15.429
you were the last police officer
to be in close contact with.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.509
David...

15:25.549 --> 15:27.549
...is there something
you're not revealing to us

15:27.589 --> 15:29.749
regarding the state of your mind

15:29.789 --> 15:32.309
before, during or after the attack?

15:34.909 --> 15:35.949
No.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.269
Right.

15:40.309 --> 15:42.109
Well, they're searching your flat.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.949
You got anywhere you can stay
tonight? Anyone you can call?

15:47.389 --> 15:48.789
Yeah... Yeah.

16:09.629 --> 16:11.589
It's the husband,
PS Budd. Sorry.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.349
All secure here.

16:27.309 --> 16:30.789
After you hung up on me,
I kept trying to call you back.

16:32.949 --> 16:36.189
They took my phone as... part
of the investigation.

16:37.749 --> 16:40.109
Why couldn't you just let me
know you were OK?

16:41.469 --> 16:42.989
Because I'm not.

16:51.589 --> 16:53.069
They've said...

16:53.109 --> 16:55.189
...one of the police officers
was killed.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.429
Is it someone you knew well?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.148
We worked together.

17:09.549 --> 17:10.628
Your new bloke...

17:12.069 --> 17:13.269
He going to make a good dad?

17:16.813 --> 17:19.292
You're their dad, Dave.
You'll always be their dad.

17:24.029 --> 17:26.829
David... It's my job to protect
the Principal.

17:28.309 --> 17:31.149
Now she's in an operating theatre
fighting for her life.

17:43.738 --> 17:46.338
Look, the sofa's made up for you.
I need to go up.

17:54.109 --> 17:55.749
We'll talk in the morning, yeah?

18:31.109 --> 18:33.669
...After the emergency
services were alerted

18:33.709 --> 18:35.509
at around 5 o'clock yesterday.

18:35.549 --> 18:38.669
There's now speculation that
their initial findings suggest

18:38.709 --> 18:42.109
the incident bears similarities to
recent acts of terror involving

18:42.149 --> 18:46.109
explosive devices, such as the
failed 1st October rail attack.

18:46.149 --> 18:48.469
I'm the Home Secretary's
Principal Protection Officer.

18:48.509 --> 18:51.189
- Is there any news?
- I'll take care of this.

18:51.229 --> 18:53.429
She's still in
the operating theatre.

18:53.469 --> 18:56.069
I can take your number and call
if there's an update.

18:56.109 --> 18:57.509
Thanks, I'll, uh...

18:59.229 --> 19:00.629
I'll--I'll wait.

19:03.189 --> 19:06.229
The police's biggest fear
has always been that these devices

19:06.269 --> 19:08.549
represent the work of
a single bomb-maker

19:08.589 --> 19:10.469
or a bomb-making terror cell.

19:11.589 --> 19:15.269
Officers from the Metropolitan
Police's Counter Terrorism Branch,

19:15.309 --> 19:18.549
SO15, have been working round
the clock to identify suspects,

19:18.589 --> 19:21.669
but apart from the man and
woman detained for their part

19:21.709 --> 19:25.789
in the 1st October attack,
there have been no further arrests.

19:25.829 --> 19:29.029
The Met's Head of Counter Terrorism,
Commander Anne Sampson,

19:29.069 --> 19:31.149
has come under increasing pressure.

19:31.189 --> 19:34.909
However, sources close to
Commander Sampson have told BBC News

19:34.949 --> 19:37.429
that the Met are facing
an extraordinary threat.

19:46.509 --> 19:48.229
Commander Anne Sampson.

19:58.269 --> 20:00.229
Thank you all for coming in.

20:00.269 --> 20:04.069
Um... The PM's asked me to step up
to Acting Home Secretary.

20:04.109 --> 20:07.349
Now, it goes without saying,
I'd never wish in a million years

20:07.389 --> 20:09.709
to assume this role
under these circumstances,

20:09.749 --> 20:13.069
and I hope it's not long before
Julia's able to retake the reins.

20:13.109 --> 20:16.429
Uh... In the meantime,

20:16.469 --> 20:18.269
my duty's very clear -

20:18.309 --> 20:20.549
to identify those responsible

20:20.589 --> 20:22.549
and neutralise any threats
still at large.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.789
I know you'll all help me
to do that.

20:24.829 --> 20:27.149
The Security Service
is working round the clock.

20:27.189 --> 20:29.709
We'll continue to serve faithfully.

20:32.509 --> 20:35.349
I understand IS
have put out a tweet.

20:37.269 --> 20:41.349
"We salute our brothers who have stuck a
knife in the heart of the British state."

20:41.389 --> 20:44.189
They're not actually claiming
responsibility,

20:44.229 --> 20:46.149
plus the tweet's light on detail,

20:46.189 --> 20:48.509
with no specific mention
of the bomber.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.869
We're conducting a meticulous
forensic examination

20:51.909 --> 20:56.509
of the crime scene, and we've begun
inspecting CCTV of the venue.

20:57.789 --> 21:01.989
So far, only one suspicious
individual has been detected -

21:02.029 --> 21:05.789
a presumptive suicide bomber
killed instantly by the blast.

21:09.069 --> 21:10.429
Tahir Mahmood.

21:13.629 --> 21:16.029
My God, how could it be someone
from our own department?!

21:16.069 --> 21:17.869
Aren't we meant to vet
these people?!

21:17.909 --> 21:21.029
The evidence incriminating Mahmood
is still only circumstantial.

21:21.069 --> 21:22.829
He was vetted - thoroughly.

21:22.869 --> 21:25.109
He had no terrorist associations
whatsoever.

21:25.149 --> 21:26.037
How could he?

21:26.078 --> 21:27.869
He was cleared to work in
the heart of Government.

21:27.909 --> 21:32.429
We've only just begun examining
Mahmood's communication history.

21:32.469 --> 21:35.029
Counter-terrorism officers
have been carrying out raids

21:35.069 --> 21:36.149
throughout the night.

21:36.189 --> 21:39.429
We've taken a number of Mahmood's
family members into custody.

21:39.469 --> 21:42.409
It's too early to exclude
anyone or anything,

21:42.450 --> 21:43.389
far too early.

21:43.429 --> 21:47.669
The more pertinent question is,
how and why did the police officers

21:47.709 --> 21:49.749
responsible for
the Home Secretary's safety

21:49.789 --> 21:51.469
fail to detect the bomb
in the first place?

21:51.509 --> 21:53.229
You're not listening, Stephen.

21:54.669 --> 21:56.589
The device wasn't planted
beforehand.

21:56.629 --> 21:59.069
It was smuggled in by Mahmood.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.629
You don't have proof yet.

22:00.669 --> 22:03.229
And all I'm hearing, Anne,
is you trying to point the finger

22:03.269 --> 22:04.669
at the Security Service.

22:04.709 --> 22:06.189
For God's sake, stop this!

22:06.229 --> 22:09.029
The country's relying on us
to work together!

22:11.669 --> 22:12.909
Thank you.

22:14.349 --> 22:17.429
Now, I know this is difficult
for everyone to contemplate,

22:17.469 --> 22:19.909
but my officers need access

22:19.949 --> 22:22.709
to all staff associated
with Mahmood.

22:25.989 --> 22:29.109
Naturally, we will cooperate fully,

22:29.149 --> 22:31.389
but this must be
in strictest confidence.

22:31.429 --> 22:33.949
- Absolutely.
- No, this cannot get out, cannot!

22:34.113 --> 22:35.474
No leaks.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.229
The more we delve into this inquiry,
the more likely it seems

22:39.269 --> 22:42.069
all the recent terror events
could be connected.

22:42.109 --> 22:44.349
In our view, the probability

22:44.389 --> 22:47.909
is extremely high of
a single bomb-maker.

22:47.949 --> 22:52.549
All these incidents could be
connected under a single conspiracy.

22:52.589 --> 22:55.909
Accomplices to that conspiracy
could still be at large,

22:55.949 --> 22:57.929
including the
mastermind behind it all.

22:58.087 --> 22:58.847
Yes.

23:00.637 --> 23:01.855
I don't...

23:02.589 --> 23:06.309
...in the circumstances mean
to sound unsympathetic,

23:06.349 --> 23:10.869
but it would help to know
if the Home Secretary's wishes

23:10.909 --> 23:13.949
still apply regarding
the Security Service taking the lead

23:13.989 --> 23:15.789
in these investigations?

23:18.909 --> 23:21.149
It's a police matter.

23:21.189 --> 23:22.589
Thank you very much.

23:23.989 --> 23:25.349
Thanks.

23:31.749 --> 23:33.949
New broom, Stephen.

23:33.989 --> 23:37.349
Seems the Acting Home Secretary's
not as susceptible to the bullshit.

24:14.709 --> 24:15.989
David?

24:28.189 --> 24:30.909
What the hell are you
still doing here?

24:30.949 --> 24:33.229
You had your job, and you failed.

24:33.269 --> 24:34.549
I'm sorry.

24:42.309 --> 24:44.789
- Roger Penhaligon. 
- Hello.

24:44.829 --> 24:47.549
We did everything we could.
I am sorry.

25:11.189 --> 25:13.389
<i>It is with the deepest regret</i>

25:13.429 --> 25:16.349
<i>that I can confirm that despite
the heroic efforts</i>

25:16.389 --> 25:18.749
<i>of our emergency services,</i>

25:18.789 --> 25:21.829
<i>the Home Secretary,
Julia Montague,</i>

25:26.989 --> 25:30.069
<i>I wish to express my Government's
gratitude to those members</i>

25:30.109 --> 25:33.189

<i>Our thoughts and prayers go out

25:45.549 --> 25:47.259

25:47.869 --> 25:51.429
<i>Yesterday's assault on

<i>for our values of tolerance,</i>

25:58.730 --> 26:01.923

<i>My Government and I will continue
to be vigilant against</i>

26:06.119 --> 26:10.069
<i>these conspiracies which betray

26:10.611 --> 26:13.709
<i>These plots do not always arise</i>

<i>from outside our number...</i>

26:17.429 --> 26:19.259
<i>...outside our community.</i>

26:20.483 --> 26:22.163
<i>Some fester within.</i>

27:53.589 --> 27:54.949
Fuck!

28:15.469 --> 28:17.909
Boss! We've got CCTV on Mahmood.

28:17.949 --> 28:19.709
Great.

28:19.749 --> 28:20.909
Play again.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.469
- Is that the briefcase?
- Yes, sir.

28:32.509 --> 28:34.469
Just watch what happens next.

28:37.709 --> 28:39.229
Shit.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.349
Play on.

28:57.349 --> 29:00.789
We're going through the Palace of
Westminster Security to ID him.

29:00.829 --> 29:01.989
Thanks, Louise.

29:11.749 --> 29:14.069
Ma'am? DCI Sharma.

29:14.109 --> 29:15.229
Ma'am.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.989
Rob Macdonald.

29:19.029 --> 29:21.029
He's worked at the Home Office
for three years,

29:21.069 --> 29:23.109
the last two as Special Advisor
to Julia Montague.

29:23.149 --> 29:24.349
Why is he of interest?

29:28.509 --> 29:30.589
Just a couple of hours
before the bombing.

29:33.829 --> 29:35.869
We understand Macdonald's
at the Home Office now.

29:35.909 --> 29:37.869
Louise Rayburn's on standby
to bring him in.

29:41.469 --> 29:42.829
Ma'am?

29:44.029 --> 29:47.189
I've only just got
the Home Office back on side.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.429
Leave this with me,
if that's OK, Deepak.

30:09.269 --> 30:10.589
Yes, ma'am?

30:10.629 --> 30:13.709
Put me through to Mike Travis
at the Home Office.

30:13.749 --> 30:14.789
Ma'am.

30:45.829 --> 30:47.429
Dave, it's me!

30:58.509 --> 30:59.589
David!

31:05.709 --> 31:07.789
David, I know you took my keys!

31:10.509 --> 31:14.789
David, I've been phoning you
all morning. I'm worried about you!

31:14.829 --> 31:17.069
Look, open the door
or I'll call the police.

31:21.349 --> 31:23.029
Dave, is that you?

31:24.589 --> 31:27.949
Look, open the door or, I mean it,
I will call the police!

31:35.469 --> 31:36.749
Dave!

31:46.109 --> 31:47.269
What is this stuff?

31:48.349 --> 31:49.589
Brass fragments.

31:52.629 --> 31:53.949
Fragments of what?

31:58.189 --> 31:59.629
From the case.

32:01.029 --> 32:02.309
What case?

32:07.869 --> 32:09.029
The bullet case.

32:16.949 --> 32:18.149
Oh, my God...

32:20.629 --> 32:22.469
Dave, what the fuck?!

32:25.309 --> 32:26.469
I...

32:29.189 --> 32:31.509
What about...?

32:31.549 --> 32:33.589
What about Ella and Charlie?!

32:33.629 --> 32:34.669
Mm...

32:35.789 --> 32:37.029
I...

32:38.629 --> 32:40.509
I'm taking you straight
to the hospital.

32:40.549 --> 32:42.989
No... no-one can know about this.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.309
There is a burn and a bruise

32:44.349 --> 32:46.549
and it looks like
you've ruptured your eardrum.

32:46.589 --> 32:49.789
- They'll heal, won't they?
- Yes, Dave, in time, but...

32:51.669 --> 32:55.509
Jesus Christ! You cannot keep
pretending that you're OK!

32:56.789 --> 32:58.509
Dave, you shot yourself!

33:02.549 --> 33:03.669
Not quite.

33:05.589 --> 33:07.109
It was a blank round.

33:08.909 --> 33:10.869
Well, why did you use a blank?

33:14.709 --> 33:16.269
I didn't know it was.

33:26.829 --> 33:28.709
I don't know how
that could've happened.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.457
Right, Vic, you'd better go.
The kids, eh?

33:35.109 --> 33:38.669
Th-There's no way
I am leaving you here like this.

33:42.389 --> 33:45.469
<i>Waterloo Station was
closed while bomb disposal officers</i>

33:45.509 --> 33:47.629
<i>were called to investigate
a suspect package...</i>

33:47.669 --> 33:50.189
<i>...The alert proved to be
a false alarm and services resumed</i>

33:50.229 --> 33:52.709
<i>this evening, though there
will be delays due to...</i>

33:52.749 --> 33:54.669
<i>...Terror cell is still at large.</i>

33:54.709 --> 33:57.789
<i>The palpable fear on the streets
of London is that the bomb-maker</i>

33:57.829 --> 33:59.389
<i>will construct more devices...</i>

33:59.429 --> 34:01.989
<i>...A terror alert at Vauxhall Bridge
was another false alarm,</i>

34:02.029 --> 34:05.529
<i>yet all police leave remains
cancelled until further notice...</i>

34:05.789 --> 34:08.149
Look, I'm really sorry,
I can't tonight.

34:08.188 --> 34:09.629
A friend's come over.

34:11.509 --> 34:13.708
She's having a bit of a crisis.

34:14.629 --> 34:16.349
Why are you wearing that?

34:17.789 --> 34:19.708
It keeps my head warm.

34:19.748 --> 34:22.268
You don't normally wear
a hat indoors.

34:22.309 --> 34:24.549
You said it's silly.

34:24.589 --> 34:26.829
Then I'm being silly.

34:26.869 --> 34:28.109
The pizza good?

34:28.328 --> 34:30.408
- It's nice. 
- It's OK.

34:39.058 --> 34:41.378
Dad... what's wrong?

34:44.549 --> 34:45.989
Nothing, I just need a hug.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.869
Dad? Are you all right?

34:59.989 --> 35:02.509
I just did something silly today.

35:02.549 --> 35:03.709
Wearing the hat?

35:04.709 --> 35:06.269
That, too.

35:08.269 --> 35:09.909
I love you both very much.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.599
Right, come on - pizza.

35:38.709 --> 35:40.829
<i>In her political career,</i>

35:40.869 --> 35:42.829
<i>Julia Montague was
a divisive figure.</i>

35:42.869 --> 35:45.629
<i>In the weeks before
her assassination,</i>

35:45.669 --> 35:48.669
<i>she was best known for spearheading
the controversial RIPA-18 Bill</i>

35:48.709 --> 35:50.429
<i>through the House of Commons.</i>

35:50.469 --> 35:53.909
<i>Her stance on national security
issues made her a target</i>

35:53.949 --> 35:56.589
<i>of protests by civil
liberties groups.</i>

35:56.629 --> 35:59.829
<i>Ms Montague was the target of
an earlier assassination attempt...</i>

36:00.989 --> 36:03.749
<i>...by a gunman who fired shots
at her ministerial car.</i>

36:03.789 --> 36:05.229
Uh, shut the door, Rob.

36:06.669 --> 36:10.469
I've had a call from
Anne Sampson, SO15 Commander.

36:10.509 --> 36:12.476
They want to go over
some things with you.

36:13.469 --> 36:14.829
Uh, just me or...?

36:16.709 --> 36:19.149
Oh, Christ, Mike, Jesus Christ!

36:19.189 --> 36:21.505
Look, mate, Sampson was
at pains to point out

36:21.546 --> 36:23.749
she doesn't want to jeopardise
our working relationship,

36:23.789 --> 36:25.429
guarantees complete discretion.

36:25.469 --> 36:28.389
- This is a voluntary interview...
- It wasn't even my idea.

36:28.515 --> 36:31.835
...a voluntary interview and
consent to forensic searches.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.429
Searches for what?

36:35.509 --> 36:37.909
Well, they need to examine
your home and vehicle

36:37.949 --> 36:39.429
for traces of explosives.

36:39.469 --> 36:41.189
What? Mike, seriously?!

36:41.229 --> 36:43.789
Look, OK, no-one needs
to know anything about it.

36:43.829 --> 36:46.149
- We'll get you the best solicitor.
- For God's sake, what?

36:46.189 --> 36:47.173
- Why is this all on me?
- Enough...

36:47.214 --> 36:48.575
Are they going to
interview you?!

36:48.616 --> 36:49.556
I said enough!

36:50.909 --> 36:52.389
They won't find anything.

36:53.549 --> 36:56.509
There's a simple, plausible story
for you to stick to.

36:56.549 --> 36:58.109
And you will stick to it.

37:05.589 --> 37:06.829
On my way.

37:07.869 --> 37:09.389
I'll be back in a sec.

37:13.229 --> 37:16.909
You've barely eaten.
I need to get back to work.

37:16.949 --> 37:18.589
You're not well enough.

37:19.629 --> 37:22.629
Something's going on,
something I can't figure out.

37:22.669 --> 37:24.309
What makes you say that?

37:25.629 --> 37:27.309
Someone tampered with my gun.

37:27.349 --> 37:30.669
It was behind a skirting board,
then I shifted it.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.949
Someone had access to my flat,

37:32.989 --> 37:34.749
carried out a thorough search...

37:34.789 --> 37:37.589
Uh, well, the-the police
searched your flat.

37:37.629 --> 37:39.909
Yeah, if they found an illegal
firearm, they'd seize it,

37:39.949 --> 37:42.149
they wouldn't just change out
the bullets for blanks.

37:42.189 --> 37:44.269
No, this was... someone else.

37:44.309 --> 37:46.069
Someone with expertise,

37:46.109 --> 37:47.469
someone...

37:48.589 --> 37:49.949
...with an agenda.

37:51.469 --> 37:53.549
Well... who would that be?

37:56.509 --> 37:59.349
For the DIR, Mr. McDonald is being
interviewed on a voluntary basis

37:59.389 --> 38:03.269
and has chosen to be
accompanied by a solicitor.

38:03.309 --> 38:05.509
Thank you for assisting our inquiry.

38:05.549 --> 38:07.869
Anything to help, anything at all.

38:07.909 --> 38:10.589
Let's start with the attack
on St Matthew's College.

38:12.229 --> 38:14.589
What were your movements
that day, sir?

38:14.629 --> 38:17.829
Uh... Commons that morning,
then back to the Home Office.

38:17.869 --> 38:20.229
You didn't travel with
the Home Secretary and her team?

38:20.269 --> 38:22.704
Oh, unfortunately, I couldn't.
There's, um...

38:22.745 --> 38:25.446
too much to deal with following
the vote on the RIPA-18 Bill.

38:25.487 --> 38:27.221
More like fortunately.

38:27.378 --> 38:29.026
You normally skip big speeches?

38:29.749 --> 38:33.269
I-I was frustrated not to be there
but I was needed in the office.

38:37.349 --> 38:40.109
For the DIR,
I'm showing Mr. McDonald

38:40.149 --> 38:43.389
video-capture images
from the Palace of Westminster.

38:46.189 --> 38:48.149
Who are seen in these images?

38:50.109 --> 38:51.749
I am, and...

38:51.789 --> 38:53.469
...Tahir Mahmood.

38:53.509 --> 38:56.349
And how would you describe your
relationship with Tahir Mahmood?

38:56.389 --> 38:59.109
Good. Why are you lying to us,
Mr. McDonald?

38:59.149 --> 39:01.149
My client is telling the truth.

39:01.189 --> 39:04.269
Provide some basis for that question
or kindly withdraw it.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.509
A forensic lip-reader
has examined the CCTV,

39:06.549 --> 39:08.269
and according to her transcript,

39:08.309 --> 39:11.149
the conversation between you
appears acrimonious.

39:15.229 --> 39:16.709
It's, uh...

39:16.749 --> 39:18.429
Politics is a high-stress business.

39:18.469 --> 39:21.429
There are words and then it's
all forgotten over a few beers.

39:22.789 --> 39:24.647
Therefore, 
it is truthful to say that you

39:24.688 --> 39:26.564
had a good relationship
with Mahmood.

39:26.605 --> 39:27.378
 Mm.

39:30.149 --> 39:31.949
But I-I didn't know him well.

39:32.989 --> 39:34.789
I mean, we-we weren't close.

39:38.029 --> 39:41.429
O-Obviously,
we're all extremely shocked

39:41.469 --> 39:43.069
to think he might be involved.

39:44.429 --> 39:46.749
So...

39:46.789 --> 39:48.989
...what's going on here, then,
Mr. McDonald?

39:58.029 --> 39:59.389
I was, um...

40:00.669 --> 40:02.549
I'm, uh...

40:02.589 --> 40:04.869
...providing Tahir
with documents relating to

40:04.909 --> 40:06.189
the Home Secretary's speech.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.509
Where did you obtain the briefcase?

40:14.989 --> 40:17.829
Um, it-it, uh, it was Tahir's.

40:17.869 --> 40:19.269
You took a long time to answer.

40:19.309 --> 40:21.269
Sorry,
it's been a very difficult time,

40:21.309 --> 40:24.269
and I couldn't immediately recall.

40:24.309 --> 40:25.469
It was Tahir's.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.189
He left it with me,
and, uh, I was returning it to him.

40:28.229 --> 40:30.429
Was there anything suspicious
about the briefcase?

40:30.469 --> 40:31.589
Uh, not that I can think of.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.309
If you were just giving him
documents,

40:33.349 --> 40:34.709
why the need for the briefcase?

40:34.749 --> 40:37.589
It seemed easier that way,
and we were returning his briefcase.

40:37.629 --> 40:39.109
We?

40:41.509 --> 40:42.549
I.

40:44.269 --> 40:47.069
We've managed to get Mahmood's
communication history.

40:47.109 --> 40:50.589
A call was received to his phone
before the bombing.

40:50.629 --> 40:53.589
Now, according to his contacts,
it's listed as your number.

40:53.629 --> 40:55.909
What was the purpose of this call,
Mr. McDonald?

40:59.789 --> 41:02.389
Probably I just called him to make
sure that everything was OK.

41:02.429 --> 41:04.469
It's an important speech

41:04.509 --> 41:06.709
and I was frustrated
not to be there in support.

41:06.749 --> 41:09.189
Everything wasn't OK, though,
was it?

41:09.229 --> 41:11.149
- I'm sorry?
- Mahmood attempted to interrupt

41:11.189 --> 41:12.549
the Home Secretary's speech.

41:12.589 --> 41:14.029
Not on my account.

41:14.069 --> 41:15.549
Odd, though, isn't it?

41:15.589 --> 41:18.189
Literally a couple of minutes
before Mahmood rushes backstage,

41:18.229 --> 41:19.669
he receives a call from you.

41:21.709 --> 41:23.689
You sure he didn't tell
you he needed to do that?

41:23.730 --> 41:24.349
Certain.

41:24.389 --> 41:26.256
He didn't seek your
advice about it?

41:26.406 --> 41:29.655
No! Whatever Tahir was doing, I'm
completely in the dark about it.

41:36.909 --> 41:39.029
These are all of
Mahmood's movements.

41:39.069 --> 41:40.789
With the Home Secretary.

41:47.229 --> 41:49.389
Receiving a call
off Rob Macdonald.

41:55.309 --> 41:57.069
Being stopped by David Budd.

42:10.989 --> 42:12.869
Why didn't he spot the bomb?

42:36.239 --> 42:37.310
-Hello. 
- Sir?

42:37.351 --> 42:38.206
Police Sergeant Budd.

42:38.247 --> 42:39.869
I'd like to speak to
your security manager, please.

42:39.909 --> 42:42.429
He'll remember me - we had
a few briefings when I stayed here.

42:42.469 --> 42:44.069
Certainly, sir.

42:44.312 --> 42:45.432
Security?

42:47.589 --> 42:49.309
Right, this is the time
I'm interested in.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.239
The Home Secretary
received a visitor.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.404
OK.

42:56.749 --> 42:57.909
Ten o'clock.

43:08.349 --> 43:09.509
What happened there?

43:09.549 --> 43:11.709
Sorry, Dave, it shouldn't do that.

43:20.149 --> 43:21.429
Shit. Uh...

43:21.469 --> 43:23.669
Let's look at the lobby
or the lifts?

43:23.709 --> 43:25.629
- See if we can nab him that way. 
- OK.

43:47.829 --> 43:49.189
Stair access?

44:00.549 --> 44:02.029
I don't know what to say, mate.

44:02.069 --> 44:04.309
Chris, no bullshit now -

44:04.349 --> 44:06.309
who's had access
to these hard drives?

44:06.349 --> 44:08.029
I checked the logs already.

44:08.069 --> 44:09.149
No-one's been at it.

44:10.389 --> 44:11.549
No-one.

44:15.469 --> 44:18.309
Do you have any leads yet on Mahmood
having any accomplices

44:18.349 --> 44:20.382
or association with
terrorist groups?

44:20.423 --> 44:21.089
No, ma'am.

44:21.130 --> 44:23.698
All the searches so far relating
to Rob Macdonald have failed

44:23.739 --> 44:25.388
to detect any traces of explosives.

44:25.429 --> 44:28.325
And it's still unclear if the device
was in the briefcase all along

44:28.366 --> 44:30.606
or if Mahmood made the pick-up
within the venue.

44:30.949 --> 44:33.043
Plus, there's still no CCTV

44:33.084 --> 44:35.244
of any of his backstage activity.

44:36.295 --> 44:37.575
All right.

44:43.429 --> 44:45.989
What's the latest re David Budd?

44:46.029 --> 44:50.309
So far, the CCTV does appear to
support Budd's version of events.

44:52.109 --> 44:54.269
He's still a person of interest,
ma'am.

44:54.309 --> 44:57.989
We've retaken responsibility
for interviewing Nadia Ali.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.909
She's our best lead
to the bomb-maker.

44:59.949 --> 45:01.389
She's terrified, though.

45:01.429 --> 45:03.189
Still in thrall to her husband.

45:03.229 --> 45:06.349
However, speaking of PS Budd,

45:06.389 --> 45:09.909
I believe there's a short cut into
convincing her she can trust us.

45:11.868 --> 45:14.908
<i>...Spokesman repeated
concerns the blasts are the work</i>

45:14.949 --> 45:16.909
<i>of a single bomb-maker.</i>

45:16.949 --> 45:19.469
<i>We have a prime suspect in
the attack on St Matthew's College</i>

45:19.509 --> 45:21.989
<i>that killed the former
Home Secretary, Julia Montague.</i>

45:22.029 --> 45:24.709
<i>...We are continuing to withhold
the name of the suicide bomber</i>

45:24.749 --> 45:26.389
<i>responsible for the attack.</i>

45:26.429 --> 45:29.749
<i>It is not yet
known if he was acting alone,</i>

45:29.789 --> 45:33.229
<i>nor is it yet confirmed
whether he was a member</i>

45:33.269 --> 45:36.029
<i>of a recognised terrorist
organisation.</i>

45:36.069 --> 45:38.869
What's with the new look?

45:38.909 --> 45:41.309
<i>...And what now for RIPA-18?</i>

45:42.309 --> 45:43.669
<i>Having lost its...</i>

45:45.029 --> 45:46.469
The hat?

45:48.109 --> 45:49.349
Keeps my head warm.

45:51.389 --> 45:53.667
Do me a favour, mate,
and remove the headgear.

45:56.029 --> 45:57.829
You're going to have to
at some point.

46:04.189 --> 46:06.429
You didn't get that in
the explosion. What happened?

46:08.429 --> 46:10.469
A gas ring was playing up.

46:10.509 --> 46:13.189
I had my head right over the hob,
didn't...

46:13.229 --> 46:15.549
...realise the gas was open
on one of the other rings.

46:15.589 --> 46:17.189
When I hit the spark...

46:24.669 --> 46:27.429
Nadia, thank you very much
for speaking to us.

46:28.469 --> 46:31.589
If anything's unclear,
please feel free to consult

46:31.629 --> 46:34.589
with your solicitor
or your Appropriate Adult.

46:34.629 --> 46:37.709
If at any time you need to stop,

46:37.749 --> 46:39.229
please just say so.

46:40.629 --> 46:41.949
Do you understand?

46:43.389 --> 46:45.109
Yes.

46:45.149 --> 46:47.909
I'm now going to hand you over
to Police Sergeant Budd.

46:47.949 --> 46:51.029
- Assalaamu Alaikum.
- Walaikum Salaam.

46:51.069 --> 46:53.869
For the DIR, I said,
"Peace be upon you,"

46:53.909 --> 46:56.949
and the interviewee replied,
"And also upon you."

46:58.546 --> 47:01.146
So, Nadia, how are you doing?

47:05.549 --> 47:07.869
This is all very... intimidating.

47:09.109 --> 47:11.949
That's why the officers here
thought it would be a good idea

47:11.989 --> 47:14.589
for me to talk with you.

47:15.589 --> 47:17.909
That was scary.

47:17.949 --> 47:19.509
On the train, when we met.

47:21.669 --> 47:25.229
I am really glad that
no-one got hurt that day.

47:25.269 --> 47:27.229
I am, too.

47:27.269 --> 47:28.989
Thank you for helping me.

47:29.909 --> 47:33.949
Nadia, what... I'd like to do is
ask you some questions

47:33.989 --> 47:36.509
about the bomb you intended
to use on the train.

47:37.549 --> 47:38.949
That'd be all right?

47:41.749 --> 47:43.229
Sorry, Nadia,

47:43.269 --> 47:45.509
is it OK if you could speak up?

47:45.549 --> 47:47.549
For the recording.

47:47.589 --> 47:49.229
Oh, sorry, um, yes.

47:51.549 --> 47:53.389
How did you obtain the bomb?

47:56.469 --> 47:58.509
I know you're frightened...

47:58.549 --> 47:59.909
...but we can protect you.

48:01.589 --> 48:03.660
Now, you believe me, don't you?

48:04.309 --> 48:06.549
Sorry. Nadia...?

48:06.925 --> 48:08.725
Oh, sorry. Um, yes.

48:10.709 --> 48:12.669
Where did the bomb come from?

48:17.149 --> 48:18.909
My husband.

48:18.949 --> 48:22.789
At this point, I should note for the
tape that I've briefed my client

48:22.829 --> 48:24.949
regarding the legal compellability
of a spouse,

48:24.989 --> 48:28.669
and Nadia's Appropriate Adult
is satisfied

48:28.709 --> 48:31.309
that she's cooperating
of her own free will.

48:31.349 --> 48:32.709
Thank you.

48:34.509 --> 48:37.109
Your husband gave you
the bomb to wear?

48:39.949 --> 48:41.029
Yes.

48:42.189 --> 48:44.047
I know this is very upsetting.

48:44.549 --> 48:46.391
But you're doing really well.

48:47.149 --> 48:48.189
Really well.

48:50.149 --> 48:52.749
Did your husband
build the bomb himself?

48:57.398 --> 48:59.078
Take your time answering.

49:01.669 --> 49:02.949
Did he build it?

49:06.749 --> 49:07.875
No.

49:08.309 --> 49:10.149
He got it from someone else?

49:17.829 --> 49:20.109
Nadia, we're desperate
to find the person

49:20.149 --> 49:22.109
who's been creating these devices.

49:22.149 --> 49:24.909
He's killed and wounded
dozens of people,

49:24.949 --> 49:27.709
and he'll kill more
if we don't catch him.

49:33.349 --> 49:34.789
He said it was a gift.

49:34.829 --> 49:36.749
A gift? Who from?

49:38.517 --> 49:39.917
He wouldn't tell me.

49:40.749 --> 49:41.805
OK.

49:43.155 --> 49:45.795
You're doing great.
This is really helpful.

49:49.429 --> 49:51.629
Perhaps he had meetings
with someone?

49:52.629 --> 49:54.389
I was never allowed.

49:54.430 --> 49:56.669
You weren't allowed to know
who he was meeting?

49:56.709 --> 49:59.429
Sometimes, he would lock me
in the house when he went out.

50:03.429 --> 50:05.309
That must have been
very frightening.

50:06.309 --> 50:07.389
And upsetting.

50:10.109 --> 50:12.109
Were there any names he mentioned?

50:13.309 --> 50:15.989
Or people he was close to
that you were suspicious of?

50:19.589 --> 50:21.469
There was only one time.

50:21.509 --> 50:22.852
What happened?

50:23.229 --> 50:24.869
He locked me in the house,

50:24.909 --> 50:28.360
but I was crying so loud he thought
the neighbours might hear.

50:28.949 --> 50:30.189
What did he do?

50:32.149 --> 50:35.509
He forced me into his car.
He made me go with him.

50:35.776 --> 50:36.816
Where?

50:37.709 --> 50:39.349
I don't know.

50:39.389 --> 50:40.709
A car park.

50:40.749 --> 50:42.086
In London?

50:42.429 --> 50:44.243
I don't know, I think so.

50:44.629 --> 50:47.509
Was it a long drive or short?

50:47.549 --> 50:48.589
How many minutes?

50:49.589 --> 50:51.109
20, no more.

50:51.149 --> 50:52.869
That's great.

50:52.909 --> 50:54.149
That's great.

50:56.189 --> 50:58.709
What happened in this car park?

50:58.749 --> 50:59.909
He met with a man.

51:00.949 --> 51:02.949
The man gave him something.

51:02.989 --> 51:05.029
That's very important information.

51:05.069 --> 51:06.469
Well done, Nadia.

51:07.389 --> 51:09.189
What did this man give your husband?

51:10.629 --> 51:11.669
I can't remember.

51:13.549 --> 51:16.269
Could it have been a piece of
luggage or a case of some sort?

51:16.309 --> 51:17.749
David...

51:19.069 --> 51:22.109
You don't remember
what the item was?

51:27.549 --> 51:29.189
The interviewee is shaking her head.

51:31.629 --> 51:33.429
Can you describe this man?

51:39.269 --> 51:41.549
No-one can hurt you, Nadia.
You're safe now.

51:43.869 --> 51:45.909
Was he... an Asian man?

51:50.949 --> 51:53.105
The interviewee is nodding.
Good.

51:53.202 --> 51:55.222
Thank you, Nadia.

52:11.469 --> 52:14.029
Have you ever seen any
of these men before?

52:15.029 --> 52:16.829
Just... take your time.

52:57.269 --> 52:58.632
I don't know, I-I...

52:58.673 --> 52:59.636
Maybe.

53:02.189 --> 53:05.589
I think we should
take a break now, Nadia.

53:05.629 --> 53:08.069
I'm going to ask my colleagues
to get together some maps

53:08.109 --> 53:09.349
and some satellite photos,

53:09.389 --> 53:12.589
and we're going to see if you can
help us locate this car park.

53:15.509 --> 53:19.109
DS Rayburn pausing
interview at 15:50.

53:31.429 --> 53:32.829
Cheers.

53:34.629 --> 53:35.829
Well done in there.

53:36.789 --> 53:39.349
Feels like we're finally
getting somewhere at last.

53:39.389 --> 53:42.229
If we're able to locate where her
husband met with the bomb supplier,

53:42.269 --> 53:45.109
maybe Nadia can pick him out
from CCTV. Yeah.

53:45.149 --> 53:46.349
We'll see.

53:46.389 --> 53:47.749
Louise?

53:48.835 --> 53:50.056
Stuff's...

53:50.555 --> 53:52.141
happening...

53:52.282 --> 53:53.275
...behind the scenes.

53:53.316 --> 53:55.956
Someone acquired access to my flat
without my knowledge.

53:56.149 --> 53:56.919
Oh...

53:57.446 --> 53:59.127
We carried out a search.

53:59.853 --> 54:02.309
- There was no sign of forced entry.
- There's more to this, Louise.

54:02.349 --> 54:05.189
Take Tahir Mahmood's position
at the Home Office.

54:05.229 --> 54:07.429
If he's really the bomber,
he wasn't vetted properly.

54:07.469 --> 54:08.869
Who's in charge of vetting?

54:08.909 --> 54:10.356
The bosses are the ones
in a slanging match

54:10.397 --> 54:11.723
with the Security Service.

54:12.020 --> 54:13.349
Way above my pay grade.

54:13.389 --> 54:15.269
Tahir couldn't have been
acting alone.

54:15.309 --> 54:17.829
He wasn't carrying the bomb
when I searched that briefcase.

54:17.869 --> 54:20.789
Someone else we don't know about
either gave it to him

54:20.829 --> 54:22.149
or planted it for him to pick up.

54:22.189 --> 54:24.389
- Someone with access. 
- Well, who?

54:28.989 --> 54:31.669
After the Home Secretary
moved to the Blackwood Hotel,

54:31.709 --> 54:35.063
someone acquired clearance to make
a secret visit to her suite.

54:35.709 --> 54:37.549
He had an insight
into her movements,

54:37.589 --> 54:39.321
was able to bypass our security.

54:39.549 --> 54:41.829
He gave the name
Richard Longcross.

54:41.869 --> 54:43.789
I viewed CCTV from the hotel.

54:43.829 --> 54:46.549
It's been tampered with,
so there's no evidence of his visit.

54:46.589 --> 54:48.389
Security Service, I'm sure of it.

54:48.429 --> 54:50.669
I'm not investigating
the Security Service,

54:50.709 --> 54:53.008
I'm investigating Tahir Mahmood.

54:53.389 --> 54:55.298
I'm sorry, David. End of.

54:55.339 --> 54:56.949
The Principal...

54:56.989 --> 54:58.309
...was killed on my watch.

54:58.349 --> 55:01.229
I want to be part of finding
the bastards that did it.

55:01.269 --> 55:03.309
Maybe that's a reason
for you not to be.

55:33.269 --> 55:34.650
This is grade-A bullshit -

55:34.691 --> 55:36.669
Sampson involving
him in the inquiry

55:36.709 --> 55:38.749
while he's still a person
of interest.

55:38.789 --> 55:41.789
Two attacks on the Home Secretary.
Budd PPO for both.

55:41.829 --> 55:43.349
Mahmood's briefcase...

55:43.389 --> 55:45.029
I don't trust him.

55:45.949 --> 55:47.069
He's hiding something.

55:51.709 --> 55:53.949
- Anything? 
- No. Nothing yet.
