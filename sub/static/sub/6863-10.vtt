WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:02.036
Please tell
the governor

00:02.070 --> 00:03.071
that BlueBell is not,
and will never be

00:03.104 --> 00:05.306
interested in merging
with Fillmore.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.675
Tell your boss that
Fillmore supports the merger.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.477
He's gonna try
and take over
the whole town.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.712
Town square is gonna be
a giant mall?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
This merger with Fillmore
is still a threat.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.084
(angry shouting)

00:16.117 --> 00:17.385
You were with
George and Tansy.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.586
Do you think he still
has feelings for her?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.088
I'm sure that
Scooter didn't know

00:20.121 --> 00:20.988
everything
Fillmore's planning.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.656
I don't want to see
this town go away.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.658
If you still want me to leave,
I'm all packed up.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.560
Do you still want
me to leave?
No.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.761
I have lined up

00:27.795 --> 00:28.796
an excellent
date for you.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.231
I have some news
of my own.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.632
I'm going on a date.
Tonight.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.367
You asked out
Vivian Wilkes?

00:33.401 --> 00:34.602
I am so completely
surprised

00:34.635 --> 00:35.769
that you would
not approve.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.771
I went bananas when
I found out that
Wade asked you out.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.307
You should
give him another chance

00:39.340 --> 00:41.075
to make you crazy.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.678
*

00:48.349 --> 00:49.550
ANNABETH:
 Okay.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.119
Here we go...

00:51.152 --> 00:53.521
Ta-da!

00:53.554 --> 00:55.823
Look,
it's a power breakfast

00:55.856 --> 00:57.591
for a power mayor.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.327
Designed to get
you back to work

00:59.360 --> 01:01.162
and hopefully out
of the house.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.331
Do we have any
more ice cream?

01:03.364 --> 01:05.633
Look, I am not opposed to
you eating your feelings.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.301
But... (laughs)

01:07.335 --> 01:09.570
maybe it's time to do
it out in the world.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.272
No.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.673
N-No, I can't.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.308
I was elected
to protect

01:14.342 --> 01:15.576
the people
of BlueBell.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.179
Now Fillmore's about
to swallow us up.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.881
Which is exactly why
you should do something.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.384
Well, I... I've
filed every petition

01:23.417 --> 01:24.852
and injunction from here
to Montgomery, and...

01:24.885 --> 01:26.554
No, there's
nothing to do

01:26.587 --> 01:28.589
except hide.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.260
With my Rocky Road.

01:35.529 --> 01:36.764
Tansy.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.666
Oh, no, you did not.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.733
Get up.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.135
(grunts)

01:41.169 --> 01:41.869
Where am I?!

01:41.902 --> 01:43.704
What is going on?

01:43.737 --> 01:44.572
Lynly, you okay?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.840
No, you just said "Tansy"
in your sleep.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.276
You were dreaming
about Tansy?

01:48.309 --> 01:49.443
You must've...
you must've heard...

01:49.477 --> 01:50.578
you must've
heard me wrong.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.680
I must've said,
like, "pansy,"

01:52.713 --> 01:54.548
or "Fancie's,"
or "chancy."

01:54.582 --> 01:55.883
My hearing's
just fine, George.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.218
How could you
do this to me?

01:57.251 --> 01:59.220
Look, I was dreaming,
okay? I...

01:59.253 --> 02:00.554
Aha!
So you admit it!

02:00.588 --> 02:02.723
You were dreaming
about Tansy!
No...

02:02.756 --> 02:04.458
Hold... wait, wait, Lynly,

02:04.492 --> 02:05.659
no, wait,
hold on, okay?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.795
Fine. I was.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.396
But not in the way
that you're thinking.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.398
Not in a Cinemax
After Dark kind of way.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.565
More like C-SPAN.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.934
I have been dreaming
about this merger
all week long.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.903
And Tansy has
been integral

02:15.936 --> 02:17.505
in helping us
fight that,

02:17.538 --> 02:19.240
and that's
all this was.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.241
Okay?
I promise.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.575
Are you sure?

02:22.710 --> 02:23.744
Absolutely.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.481
'Cause...
Lynly Hayes,

02:27.515 --> 02:29.183
you have been
the star

02:29.217 --> 02:31.852
of my most
interesting dreams.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.422
Mmm.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.489
And you know what?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.525
I'm gonna make you
breakfast.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.233
What is this?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.900
Oh, it's, uh...
Your mom just asked me

02:46.934 --> 02:48.969
to do a little,
quick rewrite

02:49.002 --> 02:51.372
on, uh, the toast for
Uncle Mort's birthday.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.873
You mean my toast?
It just...

02:52.906 --> 02:56.544
it was the
tiniest bit... dry.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.246
It just needed
some punching up.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.747
I am a celebrated
author.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.615
You don't even
know Uncle Mort.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.251
Well, I-I do now.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.853
Um, "Mort was born
on March 27, 1951

03:05.886 --> 03:07.921
"at St. Ignatius hospital
in Teaneck, New Jersey.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.223
"The hospital was

03:09.257 --> 03:10.691
"a brick building
located at

03:10.724 --> 03:12.793
"the corner of
Parsons and Oakwood.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.262
The birth took place
at 3:13 p.m."

03:14.295 --> 03:15.629
I was being thorough.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.531
Sometimes it's best to
leave the creative stuff

03:17.565 --> 03:19.633
to the more
creative people.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.501
Hey, Wade!

03:20.534 --> 03:23.371
You know, you buying
your breakfast here

03:23.404 --> 03:25.273
is not a great endorsement
for the Rammer Jammer.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.640
Yeah, well,
I'm pretty hungover,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.376
and the coffee
here is better.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.677
Your cousin and I were
out late last night

03:29.710 --> 03:30.911
in Mobile at a pretty
awesome concert.

03:30.944 --> 03:31.912
That's great.
Can you please

03:31.945 --> 03:33.281
tell Joel that
I am creative?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.516
(laughing)

03:35.549 --> 03:37.385
(Zoe mock-laughs)

03:37.418 --> 03:38.452
So funny.

03:38.486 --> 03:39.553
Have you not
seen my outfit?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.289
Polka dot blouse,
leopard print skirt.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.690
I mix patterns, okay?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.024
I am an outside-
the-box thinker!

03:44.057 --> 03:45.293
You're creative.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.460
Do not patronize me.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.628
You, do not smirk.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.437
Well, in my professional
medical opinion,

03:56.470 --> 03:58.606
I think you should blow on
your soup before you eat it.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.807
I did!

03:59.840 --> 04:01.375
SHELBY:
Brick! Drop what
you're doing!

04:01.409 --> 04:03.577
This is
an emergency!

04:03.611 --> 04:05.713
Dash quit,
and I don't have a director.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.515
And my cabaret
opens in two days.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.782
What on earth
am I gonna do?

04:08.816 --> 04:09.783
Well, calm down.

04:09.817 --> 04:10.851
Let Delma out.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.554
Delma, I recommend
Popsicles.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.356
He said I was "indecisive"

04:15.389 --> 04:16.557
and "my own worst enemy"!

04:16.589 --> 04:17.690
Well, you have been
having a hard time

04:17.725 --> 04:19.327
making decisions.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.528
And you're
pretty worked up.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.995
Here, let's check
your blood pressure.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.598
Only because
nothing feels fresh.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.899
It's all "been there,
sung that."

04:25.933 --> 04:26.967
(sighs)

04:27.000 --> 04:30.471
All my money is riding
on this cabaret.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.740
Not to mention
my hopes and my dreams.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.543
Which is why I need you
to clear your schedule

04:35.576 --> 04:37.311
and help me
find a director.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.512
Oh, I can't.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.947
I'm-I'm trying to run
a practice, here.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
Please, please, please.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.954
AnnaBeth...

04:46.987 --> 04:48.021
Brick needs to cancel

04:48.055 --> 04:49.357
all of his afternoon
appointments.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.591
See you later.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.460
Thank you.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.629
(door opens, closes)

04:55.663 --> 04:57.064
Seriously, Brick?
Again?

04:57.097 --> 04:59.066
I am powerless around
that woman, and...

04:59.099 --> 05:00.368
Help me!

05:00.401 --> 05:01.502
Oh.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.870
I've got more
than I can handle

05:02.903 --> 05:05.339
trying to keep Lavon from
overdosing on Rocky Road.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.475
I just wish Lemon was here.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.009
Me, too.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.044
She'd know exactly how
to help both of us.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.386
(door closes)

05:18.419 --> 05:20.120
AnnaBeth!

05:20.153 --> 05:21.755
As a non-Belle,

05:21.789 --> 05:23.424
you have a lot of nerve
calling a meeting.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.493
It'll be worth it.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.495
I've brought a very
special guest.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.463
Good morning, ladies.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.898
(gasps)

05:30.931 --> 05:33.000
We are gathered together today
because BlueBell

05:33.033 --> 05:34.535
faces extinction.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.136
Luckily, though I am not there

05:36.169 --> 05:38.005
nor a member of your
organization anymore,

05:38.038 --> 05:39.807
I am still Lemon Breeland.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.742
Which means I have a plan.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.810
Brava!

05:42.843 --> 05:44.478
LEMON:
Hmm.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.714
The governor's beloved sister,
Marian Matthews,

05:46.747 --> 05:48.048
will be in Mobile
this afternoon.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.383
Y'all will bring her
to BlueBell,

05:49.417 --> 05:50.518
she'll fall in love with it,

05:50.551 --> 05:52.986
hence she will call her brother,
the town will be saved,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.522
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.589
You are welcome.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.125
And how will we get
Marian Matthews to BlueBell?

05:58.158 --> 06:01.795
Well, we will use our brains,

06:01.829 --> 06:03.597
and our connections.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.133
Perhaps she was

06:06.166 --> 06:07.535
in a sorority

06:07.568 --> 06:09.803
with someone's
husband's cousin.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.505
Ooh!

06:11.539 --> 06:12.806
Marian Matthews

06:12.840 --> 06:14.875
was in Delta Gamma
with Stanley's cousin Scarlet!

06:14.908 --> 06:17.445
Scarlet's always
showing off about it.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.412
Now we're catching up.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.813
You will have Scarlet

06:19.847 --> 06:21.515
call Marian and
set up a meeting.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.650
That's brilliant.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.651
Oh, we miss you.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.553
Now, Crickett, as the leader

06:25.586 --> 06:27.020
of the Belles,
it is your responsibility

06:27.054 --> 06:29.156
to make sure that
this plan works.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.991
Do no let Marian leave BlueBell

06:31.024 --> 06:32.125
without agreeing to speak

06:32.159 --> 06:33.494
to her brother first.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.862
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.129
I have another fire to put out.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.532
(screen beeps)

06:38.566 --> 06:40.200
All right, Daddy,
now let's discuss how

06:40.233 --> 06:41.535
to free you
from Shelby's talons.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.703
Uh, still us,
Lemon!

06:42.736 --> 06:43.937
Oh.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.139
Well, y'all didn't hear that.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.641
All right!

06:47.675 --> 06:49.943
Let's put this plan
into motion, Belles!

06:49.977 --> 06:51.779
Save BlueBell!

06:51.812 --> 06:53.146
(AnnaBeth whoops)

06:56.784 --> 06:58.519
I-I feel horrible saying this,

06:58.552 --> 07:00.621
but-but Shelby is
ruining my life!

07:00.654 --> 07:02.990
Yes, which is exactly why
we need to get her out of town.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.525
Oh... do we?

07:04.558 --> 07:05.626
I-I mean, we do.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.627
Uh, right.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.762
Uh... and how will
we do that?

07:08.796 --> 07:09.797
My plan is simple.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.098
Shelby moved to town

07:11.131 --> 07:12.533
to open up that silly cabaret,

07:12.566 --> 07:13.667
and when it's
a spectacular failure,

07:13.701 --> 07:14.868
she'll leave.
(Brick laughs)

07:14.902 --> 07:16.169
It won't be a failure.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.738
Have you heard her sing?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.640
Shelby has the voice
of an angel.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.041
But you told me that
she has no director,

07:21.074 --> 07:23.110
and no real concept.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.779
She still has some time;
she'll pull it off.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.114
Not if you find her a director

07:27.147 --> 07:28.482
that will tank the show.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.951
Someone long on confidence,

07:30.984 --> 07:32.920
short on skill and experience.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.588
Lemonade, that-that plan

07:34.622 --> 07:36.924
is a smidge too
diabolical for me.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.191
I... No offense.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.660
(laughs)

07:39.693 --> 07:41.695
Well, excuse me.

07:41.729 --> 07:42.963
I was under the impression

07:42.996 --> 07:44.632
that you wanted my help.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.066
Enjoy spending
the rest of eternity

07:46.099 --> 07:47.701
with Shelby, Daddy.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.238
Also, there was a recent study

07:51.271 --> 07:53.774
that debunked the theory
that people are either

07:53.807 --> 07:55.509
"right-brained"
or "left-brained."

07:55.543 --> 07:57.177
You know, just because
I chose a life of science,

07:57.210 --> 07:58.879
it doesn't mean
I can't be creative, too.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.247
It's good that you're
letting this go.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.949
Don't box me in!
BRICK:
Joel!

08:01.982 --> 08:03.250
Just the man
I was hoping to find.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.218
Dash quit the cabaret,
and Shelby

08:05.252 --> 08:07.955
desperately needs
a new director.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.758
And I desperately need
someone else to advise her.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.225
JOEL: I did minor
in theater...
Look no further!
I'm your girl!

08:12.259 --> 08:13.961
...at Tisch.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.929
You?

08:15.963 --> 08:17.097
Yes!

08:17.130 --> 08:18.999
Let me remind you
that my mother

08:19.032 --> 08:20.534
is a famous publicist.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.136
She once represented
Stephen Sondheim.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.038
I saw Into the Woods
16 times.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.306
Oh, wow.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.808
I mean, that does make
you a director, yeah.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.242
It just so happens

08:29.276 --> 08:31.545
that I wrote
and directed

08:31.579 --> 08:34.047
an original cabaret for
the residents in my hospital

08:34.081 --> 08:35.716
to perform for
high school kids.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.118
One Cellular Sensation!

08:38.150 --> 08:39.687
It killed.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.621
Well, that...
that certainly

08:41.655 --> 08:43.624
does sound unique.
Mmm.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.992
SHELBY:
Butter Brickle, I need you

08:45.025 --> 08:46.960
to come with me
to buy more boas

08:46.994 --> 08:48.095
for the cabaret.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.997
And then we need
to work on sets.
Now?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.832
Yes, now!
And tonight.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.933
And probably through
till tomorrow.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.668
I wouldn't
count on sleeping.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.669
What can I say?

08:55.703 --> 08:56.704
My show must go on.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.140
Shelby, uh, great news.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.942
You know how
you wanted me

09:01.975 --> 09:04.077
to find you
the perfect director?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.813
Well, I did.

09:05.846 --> 09:06.980
Zoe!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.016
Zoe?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.017
You direct?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.652
She also writes.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.887
She wrote a hit
cabaret about biology.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.089
Mainly cells.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.090
It's not really what you're
looking for, there, huh?

09:17.124 --> 09:18.626
Shelby,
this could be

09:18.659 --> 09:20.160
that-that breath
of fresh air

09:20.193 --> 09:21.194
that your show needs.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.763
It-It's...
you know, it's campy.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.797
It's fun.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.899
You said yourself
you wanted something fresh.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.636
Zoe Hart,

09:28.669 --> 09:29.903
welcome to the cabaret!

09:29.937 --> 09:30.904
Oh!

09:30.938 --> 09:33.073
(laughing)

09:33.106 --> 09:35.108
Ha!

09:35.909 --> 09:38.245
(car horn honks)

09:38.278 --> 09:40.347
(seagulls calling)

09:40.380 --> 09:42.683
(birds singing)

09:50.257 --> 09:52.693
Okay, everybody.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.162
Huge news.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.865
Zoe Hart is joining us
as our new director.

09:58.999 --> 09:59.967
Zoe Hart?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.201
The doctor?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.770
Don't box me in,
Shula!

10:02.803 --> 10:03.937
Zoe has some changes

10:03.971 --> 10:05.906
that she would like
to make to the show,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.841
so let's all keep
an open mind.

10:07.875 --> 10:08.842
Yes.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.878
The cabaret will
now be called

10:10.911 --> 10:13.146
One Cellular
 Sensation!

10:13.180 --> 10:14.648
We're gonna
be performing

10:14.682 --> 10:16.116
acts about cells.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.384
Awesome.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.852
"Some Enchanted
Cytoplasm,"

10:18.886 --> 10:20.253
adapted from
 South Pacific?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.421
WANDA:
Your favorite musical

10:21.454 --> 10:23.190
and your favorite
organelle!

10:23.223 --> 10:25.859
Uh, my song is about
mitochondria?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.027
And the human condition.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.328
But also
mitochondria.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.664
MEATBALL:
Uh, which one
of these songs

10:30.698 --> 10:31.899
is the most metal?

10:31.932 --> 10:32.966
Let's start blocking.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.702
Shula, you're up.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.369
Hey.
Hey!

10:36.403 --> 10:37.871
Did you hear that?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.807
I said, "Blocking."
That's a director word.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.208
Nice. I just came by

10:41.241 --> 10:42.776
because you forgot
your megaphone.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.712
I know you wanted
to look the part.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.347
I am doing much more
than looking the part.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.116
Shula, you're a protozoa.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.919
So why don't you go
downstage right?

10:54.221 --> 10:57.057
I definitely meant
downstage left.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.860
Are you-Are you
trying, maybe,

10:59.893 --> 11:02.195
to get her to go
upstage left?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.396
Blocking isn't essential

11:03.430 --> 11:04.397
to One Cellular Sensation!
Many protozoa barely move.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.067
Are you sure
you don't want me
to stick around

11:07.100 --> 11:09.336
and help out a little bit?
I really don't mind.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.772
No. No, no. Go!
Go, go, go. Yeah, I got this.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.373
Okay.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.844
Sheesh, everybody wants
to be in showbiz.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.880
From the top!

11:29.122 --> 11:31.358
Tansy, is, uh,
everything okay?

11:31.391 --> 11:35.729
No. Someone bought all the
Rocky Road from the Dixie Stop.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.731
And I had a fight with Scooter.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.333
He says I'm being cagey,
which I am

11:40.367 --> 11:42.302
ever since I let y'all
into that party.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.503
I feel so guilty.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.774
Well...

11:46.807 --> 11:48.041
Tansy, you shouldn't.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.110
Because McGreevy sucks.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.244
Excuse me?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.380
The man is a Class-A
rotten jerkface...

11:53.413 --> 11:54.748
who sucks.

11:54.782 --> 11:55.615
You're wrong.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.085
Scott McGreevy is a kind,
decent man

11:58.118 --> 12:00.420
and he loves me.
And he loves my Dolly Parton.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.490
All he wants is to do
right by his town.
Just like you.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.758
No, there's a difference.

12:04.792 --> 12:08.161
And that difference is we are
not trying to destroy anybody.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.898
I mean, they're trying
to annex BlueBell!

12:10.931 --> 12:13.066
Fillmore is
a death star, okay?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.402
And Mayor Gainey
is Emperor Palpatine.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.070
And Scooter McGreevy,
is his Darth Vader.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.038
Seriously?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.907
Life is not Star Wars,
George Tucker.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.009
Why don't you try
asking him his plans?

12:22.042 --> 12:24.945
Because they include bulldozing
this town square here

12:24.978 --> 12:26.513
and putting up
a shopping center.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.849
I don't need
to ask him his plans

12:28.882 --> 12:30.483
because I know Scott.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.853
Besides, how do you get off
criticizing my relationship

12:32.886 --> 12:34.454
when you're dating
little Miss Crazy Eyes?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.990
You're being very mature here.

12:37.024 --> 12:37.991
George, as a hairdresser,

12:38.025 --> 12:40.293
I look at women in the mirror
all day long.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.294
Believe me,

12:41.328 --> 12:43.396
Mm.
I can spot crazy eyes.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.066
I'd be careful if I was you.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.467
And I'd be careful

12:47.500 --> 12:50.904
if I was me talking to you.
(clears throat)

12:50.938 --> 12:53.006
Hey, George! Hey, Tansy!

12:53.040 --> 12:55.042
Fancy finding you... together.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.444
Well, three's a crowd.
Bye.
(clears throat)

12:57.477 --> 12:59.847
Talking merger stuff again?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.548
Yes, we were.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.020
When my sorority sister Scarlet
told me y'all wished

13:07.054 --> 13:08.822
to emulate
our annual Marigold Ball,

13:08.856 --> 13:10.824
I came straight from Montgomery.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.259
Since you took over
the Marigold Ball,

13:12.292 --> 13:15.095
it has been the social event
of the year.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.998
We were hoping
to take you on a tour

13:18.031 --> 13:19.332
and get some input
on venues.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.968
And maybe your brother,
the governor,

13:21.001 --> 13:23.270
would like to attend
our ball here in BlueBell.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.473
Perhaps, but aren't we getting
a little ahead of ourselves?

13:26.506 --> 13:31.211
(clears throat)
Crickett is just full
of town pride.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.546
Loves showing off BlueBell
to everyone.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.148
I do.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.084
Because once
someone sees our
beautiful town,

13:37.117 --> 13:40.153
it is hard for them
to stand by to see it

13:40.187 --> 13:42.489
swallowed up by another,
uglier one.

13:42.522 --> 13:46.626
I'm not here to discuss
the Marigold Ball, am I?

13:46.659 --> 13:51.098
Discussing the Marigold Ball
is definitely one

13:51.131 --> 13:53.566
of the reasons
why you are here.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.903
I've heard about
your impending merger.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.471
I don't appreciate being used.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.173
We have nothing further
to discuss.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.241
Oh, Mrs. Matthews,
please.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.644
Let me at least buy you
a sweet tea before you go.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.479
Agnes' are famous.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.983
I cannot resist sweet tea.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.986
But in this case,
I prefer to go alone.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.328
Hey, Cricket,
what are you doing?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.662
Hiding from Lemon.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.998
Lemon? I thought
she was out of town.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.334
She is, but the Internet
is everywhere.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.302
She's already trying to help
Brick get rid of Shelby,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.071
and I don't want to be next.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.340
How is Lemon helping Brick
get rid of Shelby?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.475
I don't know.
See, I thought it was

14:35.508 --> 14:37.044
by having Zoe Hart direct
that cabaret,

14:37.077 --> 14:39.046
but the cabaret
is awesome.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.181
It is about cells and...

14:41.214 --> 14:43.183
Oh, God, I can't let her leave.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.185
Shelby?
Marian Matthews!

14:45.218 --> 14:47.955
That's her car.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.522
I gotta go!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.998
Mm... hmm.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.100
Is that... gum?

15:00.133 --> 15:01.134
Oh, ew.

15:01.168 --> 15:05.973
The sexy reality of being
a fourth-grade teacher.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.208
Well, you are lucky
that you have me

15:08.241 --> 15:11.044
to keep a close eye on you
and that behind of yours.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.612
Keep you gum-free.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.047
Mmm.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.615
Hey, you got plans
tomorrow night?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.684
Scored two tickets to go see
Double Wednesday play

15:17.717 --> 15:20.720
an almost-unheard-of
acoustic show in Mobile.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.522
Wow. That sounds amazing.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.991
Pick you up at 9:30?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.959
Great!

15:25.993 --> 15:27.594
Great. 9:30.
All right.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.996
See you then.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.431
See ya later, sugar.
All right!

15:31.464 --> 15:34.201
(whistles through teeth)

15:34.234 --> 15:37.004
Thought you said
things were going
great with Vivian?

15:37.037 --> 15:39.072
They are. We got plans
for tomorrow night.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.274
She was, uh, pumped.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.210
No, she wasn't.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.412
Where did you find the time
between hairdressing,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.580
waitressing, and process serving
to go to psychic school?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.149
Or was it an online course?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.483
I'm serious, Wade.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.219
Right before she said "Great!"
she paused

15:52.252 --> 15:54.187
and she moved her hair
over her left shoulder.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.655
That is her tell,
like in poker.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.225
I am very good
at identifying tells.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.093
And crazy eyes, though
that does not apply here.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.694
Vivian is a classy lady.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.464
She doesn't want to be going to
different dive bars every night.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.233
You need to step up your game.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.304
ZOE:
Hey!

16:12.472 --> 16:14.174
Hi.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.443
For your information,
rehearsals are going great.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.446
Six hours at the helm,
and lines are memorized,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.514
dances are... in progress.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.582
I'm sure they are.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.651
I feel your lack of support.
Rude.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.320
Hey, Wade,
can I get 17 coffees?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.389
We're pulling an all-nighter
at the cabaret,

16:29.422 --> 16:31.691
or at least a midnighter.
I'm directing now.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.027
(laughs)

16:35.062 --> 16:36.563
Oh, man.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.298
Oh, you're serious.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.734
Well, that should at least make
the cabaret interesting.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.071
Hey, maybe I should take Vivian.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.473
She would love it.
Who wouldn't?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.808
Well, me, for one, but, uh,
that's what earplugs are for.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.511
Zo, about the cabaret.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.047
Um, Brick chose you
for a reason.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.115
And you should know...

16:55.148 --> 16:58.151
Brick chose me because
he believes in my project!

16:58.185 --> 16:59.619
Who would have thought
that Brick Breeland

16:59.652 --> 17:02.222
would be more supportive
of my creative endeavors
than you?!

17:02.255 --> 17:05.625
God, after all those
nights listening to
you drone on and on

17:05.657 --> 17:08.095
about your novel...
Which sounds so great!

17:08.127 --> 17:10.329
Hey, you know what?
Good luck to you.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.464
Thank you.

17:12.499 --> 17:16.469
You are going to be wowed,
my friends.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.805
I'm gonna send Tom
for the rest of these.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.107
Wowed, I said.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.641
Wowed!

17:26.346 --> 17:28.115
I'm coming!

17:28.147 --> 17:29.516
I figured out how

17:29.549 --> 17:32.519
to get Marian Matthews
to stay in BlueBell!

17:32.552 --> 17:34.087
What is that?

17:34.121 --> 17:36.256
Spark plugs? I don't know.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.325
I just opened her car hood
and pulled.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.025
You didn't.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.193
I panicked! But she's staying

17:40.227 --> 17:43.130
the night at the Shamrock,
so at least I did something.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.531
What is your boyfriend,

17:44.564 --> 17:48.268
the mayor, doing
to save BlueBell, hmm?

17:57.477 --> 17:58.811
Morning.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.613
Oh! Good morning!

18:01.781 --> 18:03.550
I have news!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.152
The merger's off?

18:05.185 --> 18:07.454
Crickett stole
the spark plugs,
or something,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.756
out of Marian Matthew's car,
and she was forced

18:09.789 --> 18:11.658
to stay the night
at the Shamrock Motel.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.193
Marian Matthews?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.762
As in-As in the sister
of the governor of Alabama?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.398
Yes.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.701
But, glass half full,
she's in BlueBell another day!

18:21.734 --> 18:23.436
Time to get out and sell her!

18:23.470 --> 18:24.704
I'm, I'm going back to bed.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.275
No, you are not!

18:28.308 --> 18:30.877
More news!

18:30.910 --> 18:33.780
Lemon is gonna give you
a motivational speech.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.248
Lemon?

18:35.282 --> 18:37.717
Mm-hmm.
Oh!

18:37.750 --> 18:40.253
Lavon, today may very well be
 the defining day

18:40.287 --> 18:42.455
in your mayorship,
so you have a choice.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.858
Are you gonna spend it
in your pajamas,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.860
or are you gonna
go find Marian Matthews,

18:47.894 --> 18:49.929
convince her that BlueBell's
a place like no other,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.331
and save the day?!

18:51.364 --> 18:55.335
If-If I go, will you close
the computer?

18:55.368 --> 18:56.436
I'll get dressed.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.604
ANNABETH:
Ooh!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.706
Thank God.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.614
(clears throat)

19:07.647 --> 19:09.716
Scooter McGreevy...

19:09.749 --> 19:11.418
what brings you to BlueBell?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.486
Just visiting my girlfriend.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.356
She is determined
to work in this craphole.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.226
So I guess you better get
used to seeing me around.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.294
Hey, when are you gonna trade in
this loser?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.229
(blows raspberry)

19:22.262 --> 19:23.062
Did you just...?

19:23.095 --> 19:25.232
Anyway, Tucker,
isn't it about time

19:25.265 --> 19:27.334
we bury the hatchet? You know,

19:27.367 --> 19:28.468
find our common ground?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.237
Get to know one another
as friends?

19:30.270 --> 19:31.238
Really? Friends?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.505
'Cause you just,
you called me...

19:32.539 --> 19:34.707
That is so sweet
of you, Scott.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.444
It'd probably for the best
as I'll be taking over

19:37.477 --> 19:40.513
much of your business
once the towns merge.

19:40.547 --> 19:44.484
Okay, well, this was fun.
Lot of fun.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.621
George, I have someone for you.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.258
LEMON: George,
there you are!
Lemon?!

19:51.291 --> 19:52.659
Hello, Lynly. Miss me?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.561
Hi, Lemon!
How's your grandma?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.396
Oh, who cares?
Here's the point.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.730
Lavon is taking
the governor's sister

19:57.764 --> 19:58.998
around BlueBell this afternoon,

19:59.031 --> 20:01.368
so I need you two
to make sure that Gainey

20:01.401 --> 20:03.270
and his Fillmore lackeys
don't go near them

20:03.303 --> 20:04.371
so they don't sabotage him.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.674
But Scooter McGreevy's
in the Rammer Jammer right now!

20:07.707 --> 20:09.676
Don't worry about this,
Lemon. I got it.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.611
Do not disappoint me, Tucker.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.780
That was weird.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.818
Hey, Scooter. I'm sorry.
Maybe you're right.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.587
Maybe we should bury
the hatchet.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.689
Sooner rather than later.
Today, even, if we can.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.558
How about right now, actually?
Let's go shoot nine holes,

20:25.592 --> 20:27.960
and you can put
your money where
your mouth is, huh?

20:27.994 --> 20:30.297
Ooh, uh, sorry.
I do have plans

20:30.330 --> 20:32.965
to go hiking with Tansy
as soon as her shift ends.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.701
Great! A double date!

20:34.734 --> 20:36.503
How fun does that sound?!

20:36.536 --> 20:38.004
Wait-- we're doing what?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.310
So, how do I look?

20:43.343 --> 20:45.778
Like a bug
that just got stepped on.

20:45.812 --> 20:46.713
You look great.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.848
Now, Frank, you have
have the saddest song

20:48.881 --> 20:49.949
in the show,
it's called,

20:49.982 --> 20:53.886
"There's No Tosis Like Aptosis,"
which is cell death.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.955
That is sad.
Why do they die?

20:55.988 --> 20:58.325
It's one of the
mysteries of cells.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.292
That's messed up.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.793
Brought donuts!

21:00.827 --> 21:01.894
Donuts!

21:01.928 --> 21:03.896
No, we-we don't have
time for donuts!

21:03.930 --> 21:07.066
Okay, everybody, take five!

21:07.099 --> 21:08.601
Look, I-I was really hoping
that you were here

21:08.635 --> 21:10.803
to apologize
for all the doubting.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.773
Uh, no, actually I'm here
because I know something.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.742
Um, I was gonna tell you
last night when you came home,

21:15.775 --> 21:17.009
but you never came home.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.578
(sighs)
I was working on costumes.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.347
The cell membranes?
They kept getting jammed

21:20.380 --> 21:22.915
in the sewing machine,
so I had to do them all by hand.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.951
Wow, uh, you're not
making this easier.

21:24.984 --> 21:25.985
Um... (chuckles)

21:26.018 --> 21:28.054
Okay.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.323
Crickett told me
that Brick is working

21:30.357 --> 21:32.959
on a plan to get
rid of Shelby.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.727
And that plan is hiring you

21:34.761 --> 21:37.464
to tank her show.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.899
(sighs)
Poor Joel.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.601
Is that what you have
to tell yourself

21:41.634 --> 21:42.635
to be okay with this?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.971
First of all, Brick would
not set me up like that.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.138
Second of all,

21:46.172 --> 21:48.040
Crickett is not known for
getting her facts straight.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.843
And third, why are you so sure
that my show is gonna tank?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.912
It's a cabaret about cells.
And the human condit...

21:52.945 --> 21:54.046
And the human condition.
Okay, look.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.082
If you don't believe me,
how about I just stick around

21:56.115 --> 21:58.050
and, uh, see your first
run-through, you know.

21:58.084 --> 21:58.918
We'll watch the show together.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.621
Yes, that is a wonderful idea.
Okay.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.023
Everyone, everyone,
let's get your costumes on.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.592
We're gonna do a
full run-through.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.764
Okay, so imagine
that you just stepped out

22:11.798 --> 22:13.833
of a cab on Madison Avenue.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.768
You walk into the Carlyle.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.937
This is what you see.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.972
*

22:23.410 --> 22:25.412
* We are the plant cells

22:25.445 --> 22:27.847
* Our structure excels

22:27.880 --> 22:29.849
* 'Cause we've got chlorophyll

22:29.882 --> 22:31.751
* And we photosynthesize

22:31.784 --> 22:34.621
* Oxygen, it expels

22:34.654 --> 22:36.823
* From us, the plant cells

22:36.856 --> 22:38.925
* We are rectangular

22:38.958 --> 22:41.461
* And become specialized

22:41.494 --> 22:43.630
* When it comes
to reproduction *

22:43.663 --> 22:46.098
* We need no instruction today

22:46.132 --> 22:48.100
* 'Cause when we do mitosis

22:48.134 --> 22:50.570
* We replicate
our perfect state *

22:50.603 --> 22:53.406
* We are the plant cells

22:53.440 --> 22:55.508
* Flagella sometimes propels

22:55.542 --> 22:59.145
* We're green and lean
and we reproduce *

22:59.178 --> 23:00.813
Sexually?

23:00.847 --> 23:01.914
* A-sexually.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.883
(all panting)

23:05.752 --> 23:08.020
You're right, my show sucks.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.891
Miss Matthews?

23:11.924 --> 23:13.860
Uh, L-Lavon Hayes.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.928
Uh, I'm the mayor of BlueBell.
Good.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.930
Then you can tell me
where the bus station is.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.999
Oh, look, you've had
a terrible experience here.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.200
So, please allow me a chance

23:21.233 --> 23:22.869
to change your impression.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.004
And why on earth
would I do that?

23:25.037 --> 23:27.607
Because the people of BlueBell
really love our town.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.141
And we are very afraid

23:29.175 --> 23:31.478
we're gonna lose it.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.879
I mean,
if y-your brother ratifies

23:32.912 --> 23:34.881
the upcoming merger
with Fillmore,

23:34.914 --> 23:37.016
our-our community

23:37.049 --> 23:38.150
and our unique
sense of identity,

23:38.184 --> 23:39.686
and, believe me...

23:39.719 --> 23:41.754
it is unique...

23:41.788 --> 23:43.623
will be gone.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.893
Now, if you spend
some time here...

23:46.926 --> 23:48.127
you'll see that for yourself.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.598
You're having a cabaret?

23:51.631 --> 23:54.000
I love cabarets.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.603
If I could do anything in life,
it'd be to sing.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.738
Done! Shelby's out, you're in.

23:58.771 --> 23:59.906
(laughing): Heavens no.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.508
I have a voice
that would kill cats.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.709
Oh.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.744
But you get me a table
front and center,

24:04.777 --> 24:07.013
and I'll stay.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.749
(chuckles)

24:09.782 --> 24:12.619
Bertram Brick Breeland,
I am nobody's patsy!

24:12.652 --> 24:15.187
If I had a dollar for
every dramatic entrance.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.590
I know that you are using me
to tank the show.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.791
What I don't know is

24:18.825 --> 24:20.660
how you could do this to me?

24:20.693 --> 24:23.195
I am so sorry, Zoe.
This isn't me.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.097
But Shelby was making me
so crazy.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.800
I just needed to find a way
to get her out of here.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.736
And I-I should've known better
than to listen to Lemon.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.270
It was an awful thing to do!

24:31.303 --> 24:32.805
Agree!
But I-I...

24:32.839 --> 24:34.006
I'm gonna man up,
I'm gonna tell Shelby

24:34.040 --> 24:36.275
to do the show
that she wanted to do

24:36.308 --> 24:38.578
and postpone the opening
a few weeks,

24:38.611 --> 24:40.012
and really get it right.
Good.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.615
A.B., great news.
Hmm?

24:42.649 --> 24:45.151
Uh, the-the governor's sister
agreed to stay

24:45.184 --> 24:47.554
just to see the cabaret tonight!
Oh, no.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.955
Could she come back
in a few weeks?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.657
You will open the
cabaret tonight.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.158
Whatever it takes.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.560
Now, look, we got exactly
one more chance

24:53.593 --> 24:54.794
to-to make her love BlueBell

24:54.827 --> 24:57.229
and talk her brother
out of the merger.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.798
FRANK:
Zoe, what's my lysosome's

24:58.831 --> 25:00.900
motivation?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.236
How do you think the
governor's sister

25:04.270 --> 25:06.706
feels about cellular biology?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.747
I think the waterfall is
right around this bend.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.148
That's what you said
about the last bend.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.050
And the bend before that.
(sighs)

25:18.084 --> 25:20.853
So, you're heading
to law school?

25:20.887 --> 25:21.988
Yes, well,

25:22.021 --> 25:23.856
it's between law school,
medical school,

25:23.890 --> 25:26.025
or I might become
a fashion designer.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.195
Sure, those are
all very similar.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.864
I have trouble
making up my mind.
Oh.

25:31.898 --> 25:34.734
And how exactly did you
come to stay with Lavon?

25:34.767 --> 25:36.669
My parents thought
I needed a change of pace.

25:36.703 --> 25:37.704
Why was that?

25:37.737 --> 25:40.072
See, my ex-boyfriend
was obsessed with two things.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.941
His lawn and other women.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.743
So, when I found out
he cheated on me,

25:43.776 --> 25:46.112
I put lime in his hose
and killed the lawn.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.147
It may have been
a step too far.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.017
You know though, I think
Tansy can appreciate that.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.284
Because when we broke up, uh,

25:52.318 --> 25:54.153
she threw all my clothes
out of a trailer window.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.288
So...
Now, that's a statement.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.223
So, uh, Scooter.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.091
We should probably talk
about this merger.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.927
I don't know what you've heard,

26:00.960 --> 26:02.962
but it sounds to me
like it's moving forward.

26:02.995 --> 26:03.996
And it's gonna be great.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.297
And best thing
about this merger,

26:05.331 --> 26:07.634
it's gonna end the
intertown hostility.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.434
Build some brotherly love.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.369
Give us a chance
to work together.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.806
Hmm, I love how you care
about peace, Scooter.

26:19.011 --> 26:19.979
Hey, there.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.047
Hey.
I've been looking for you.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.615
I was just gonna call you.
Oh?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.083
Why?
Well, uh,

26:24.116 --> 26:25.785
change of plans!
I got us, uh,

26:25.818 --> 26:27.654
two tickets
for the cabaret tonight.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.756
Your crazy cousin Zoe
is directing,

26:29.789 --> 26:32.024
which should be interesting.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.159
Uh, show starts at 9:30,

26:33.192 --> 26:34.293
thought I'd pick you up at 9:00

26:34.326 --> 26:35.795
for what will probably be

26:35.828 --> 26:37.797
a terrible night at the theatre.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.199
Oh, and by the way,
that's theatre with an R-E

26:40.232 --> 26:42.635
because, you know,
I'm classy like that.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.170
But I was actually coming
to cancel our date.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.205
I'm so sorry.
My babysitter's sick.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.240
She ate some bad tilapia.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.409
Don't you have, like,
a million relatives?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.945
I thought that's the big perk
of that situation.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.246
You got built-in babysitting.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.215
Yeah, you know,
they're all going,

26:56.248 --> 26:58.184
they're all going to see,
my, uh, great-uncle tonight.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.019
He, um, he also had

27:00.052 --> 27:01.353
the tilapia.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.389
Yeah.
You okay?

27:03.422 --> 27:06.392
Yeah, you just, you know,

27:06.425 --> 27:10.029
you did that, uh,
hair thing again.

27:10.062 --> 27:10.997
Oh, did I mess it up
or something?

27:11.030 --> 27:12.098
No, no.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.833
No.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.034
You have a good night, Vivian.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.303
I'm sorry, Wade.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.043
(sighs)

27:24.076 --> 27:25.912
I'm beginning to think
this waterfall is

27:25.945 --> 27:27.914
just another figment of your
overactive imagination, Tucker.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.048
Like your legal skills.
(laughs)

27:29.081 --> 27:31.784
Does that mouth of yours
ever stop flapping, McGreevy?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.153
Uh-oh, somebody
miss nap time?

27:34.186 --> 27:35.888
What is it-- you thirsty?

27:35.922 --> 27:36.789
You hungry?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.357
You jealous that I
ended up with Tansy

27:38.390 --> 27:40.126
and your new girlfriend
has crazy eyes?
Uh-oh.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.193
What did you just say?

27:41.227 --> 27:42.161
Okay, you're gonna
want to retract

27:42.194 --> 27:43.730
those words immediately.
Your problem is not

27:43.763 --> 27:45.231
with Lynly, it's with me.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.265
Let's all calm down.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.499
What's with all the aggression?

27:47.533 --> 27:51.437
We're just a couple of pals out
for a friendly hike, right?

27:51.470 --> 27:53.205
Is that right, pal?

27:53.239 --> 27:55.307
Are you gonna
really stand there

27:55.341 --> 27:57.409
and tell me
that Fillmore doesn't plan

27:57.443 --> 27:59.011
on wiping BlueBell off the map

27:59.045 --> 28:00.079
and call it a merger?

28:00.112 --> 28:01.981
Whoa, bad info.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.149
Incorrect.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.350
Ah.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.818
Is it also incorrect information

28:05.852 --> 28:07.820
that you want to bulldoze
our town square,

28:07.854 --> 28:10.022
put up a mall called
the Gainey Shopping Center?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.257
Oh, my God, that's awful!

28:11.290 --> 28:14.026
What kind of monster
would do that?

28:14.060 --> 28:17.229
Scott may be many things,
but he is not a monster.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.464
And he doesn't lie.
Hmm.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.465
Not to me.

28:19.498 --> 28:20.632
Hmm.
Scott?

28:20.666 --> 28:22.835
How could you possibly know
about the shopping center?

28:22.869 --> 28:25.004
Only three people know
about that plan.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.840
Did you spy on me?

28:27.874 --> 28:29.141
For them?

28:29.175 --> 28:31.343
I'm sorry, Scooter.
I shouldn't have done it.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.013
Apology not accepted.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.247
From either of you.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.983
I didn't apologize.
I'm going home.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.952
Alone. I suggest you stay in
BlueBell with your friends,

28:39.986 --> 28:42.221
and think about where
your loyalties really lie

28:42.254 --> 28:44.757
before I bulldoze
right over them.

28:44.791 --> 28:45.457
But what about Dolly?

28:45.491 --> 28:46.358
I'll feed her.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.127
But I'm telling her
what her mother did.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.063
Tried to save a town.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.399
That's what her mother did.
Tell Dolly that!

28:53.432 --> 28:56.202
And don't you go lying
to that dog about me!

28:57.369 --> 28:58.805
SHELBY:
 I don't get it.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.140
You convinced me that this
was the way to go.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.474
You said cells sell.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.944
But at the dress rehearsal

29:04.977 --> 29:06.879
we realized that
 One Cellular Sensation!

29:06.913 --> 29:09.782
isn't all
that we hoped it would be.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.218
Really?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.253
Well, see, I just don't
think BlueBell is-is

29:14.286 --> 29:16.322
ready for something
so ambitious.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.958
Classics are classics
for a reason.

29:18.991 --> 29:19.892
I think you should
go back to

29:19.926 --> 29:21.427
what you were working
on when Dash quit

29:21.460 --> 29:23.195
and-and get that
ready for tonight.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.431
Brick Breeland,

29:25.464 --> 29:26.565
what is really going on here?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.801
Look.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.405
I was trying to tank your show.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.241
'Cause...

29:35.274 --> 29:38.277
I wanted to get rid of you.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.046
It's horrible.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.014
I know, I-I, but I...

29:42.048 --> 29:43.382
I just couldn't take it anymore.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.951
You blew into town.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.185
You-you take over my life.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.486
I'm a grown man,
I should've been able

29:47.519 --> 29:49.055
to say no to you.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.123
But you give me that look.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.959
That-that look
that's-that's like

29:52.992 --> 29:55.461
a tractor beam,
and I can't resist you.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.596
How could you...?

29:57.629 --> 29:58.831
Shelby?

29:58.865 --> 30:00.199
Oh.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.242
Okay, thank you, Brick.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.411
Bye.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.512
Shelby and the baby are okay.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.381
But her blood pressure is low,

30:15.414 --> 30:16.482
so she's on bed rest.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.317
She's gonna be fine.
Oh, thank God.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.619
The only thing
to figure out now is the show.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.254
You're still doing the show?

30:22.288 --> 30:24.090
Yes. To save BlueBell.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.059
But I was hoping

30:27.093 --> 30:29.428
that you would do the show.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.063
You know, you
have all that

30:31.097 --> 30:32.965
actual theater experience.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.067
And right now, BlueBell
really needs that experience.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.638
Uh...

30:39.671 --> 30:41.307
Okay, okay, yeah, okay, uh,

30:41.340 --> 30:42.975
I just need some time
to come up

30:43.009 --> 30:45.044
with a thematic through line,
uh, do a little research...

30:45.077 --> 30:45.844
You got two hours.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.246
Or I could jump right in.
Okay.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.247
All right.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.149
Listen up, everybody.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.551
Shelby is out.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.020
(all groan)
I know.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.121
She was our nucleus.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.655
But now just imagine

30:56.688 --> 31:00.326
a new nuclear membrane

31:00.359 --> 31:03.395
is forming around you.

31:03.429 --> 31:04.630
I'm not feeling this metaphor.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.298
Me neither.
Sorry.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.167
I'm lost.
Joel is your new director!

31:08.200 --> 31:09.902
Oh!
What?

31:09.936 --> 31:11.637
Yes, and we're gonna go back
to the more traditional cabaret

31:11.670 --> 31:13.172
that you guys were preparing.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.007
Our only numbers
in that other show

31:15.041 --> 31:16.508
was between Shelby's
wardrobe changes.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.610
Without her,

31:18.644 --> 31:20.947
we got a 12-minute cabaret.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.083
Well, then it will be 12 minutes
no one will ever forget.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.985
Okay?

31:26.018 --> 31:27.219
All right, let's, uh,
take it from the top.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.455
(chattering)

31:30.957 --> 31:32.591
SHELBY:
 This cabaret has been

31:32.624 --> 31:34.426
my dream since
I was a little girl.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.630
And I was so close
to making it happen.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.499
Can't bed rest
start tomorrow?

31:40.532 --> 31:42.034
I'm afraid not.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.003
We just can't
take any chances.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.505
It was really sweet,
what you said earlier.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.573
Oh, what?

31:47.606 --> 31:49.375
That you were
ruining my life?

31:49.408 --> 31:52.278
About not being
able to resist me.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.314
I like having
that effect on you.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.382
(laughs softly)

31:56.415 --> 31:58.050
But I don't want
to drive you crazy.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.252
That's not
fair to you.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.254
Well, I... I was
thinking, you know...

32:02.288 --> 32:05.557
It-it's... it's
only crazy-making

32:05.591 --> 32:07.659
if I try and
resist you, and...

32:07.693 --> 32:10.496
...there is
another option.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.131
There is?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.566
I mean, I...
could just

32:14.600 --> 32:16.602
stop resisting.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.176
We can never
tell Lemon.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.212
Mm-mm.
(laughs)

32:29.415 --> 32:32.218
Oh, you are
doing that thing

32:32.251 --> 32:33.752
right now, right now.
Th-that tractor beam thing.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.688
Well, there is just
one more thing

32:36.722 --> 32:38.991
I need your
help with.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.426
(Tansy whoops)

32:40.459 --> 32:42.528
Wow.
That is, like, 19 straight.

32:42.561 --> 32:43.996
That's a new record, I think.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.297
(laughs)

32:45.331 --> 32:46.732
Seriously,
how do you do that?

32:46.765 --> 32:47.633
The trick is

32:47.666 --> 32:49.301
to look at the shot glass,
not the quarter.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.302
LYNLY:
You know what?

32:50.336 --> 32:52.404
Scooter is a jerk.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.206
Even drunk,
she speaks the truth.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.742
(snorts)
LYNLY:
A person can be
nice to a dog

32:56.775 --> 32:59.245
and still be a jerk
to a person.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.712
You are amazing.

33:02.581 --> 33:06.552
And I think you deserve
a million times better than...

33:06.585 --> 33:08.120
(yawns)

33:08.154 --> 33:09.388
...a bicycle.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.323
I think you're
falling asleep.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.059
I am not...

33:13.092 --> 33:15.294
One second.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.202
All right.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.537
You want to go out and
get some air or something?

33:25.571 --> 33:26.605
Yeah.
(laughs)

33:31.210 --> 33:33.179
*

33:33.212 --> 33:35.181
LAVON:
All right,
here we are.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.782
Best seats in the house,
as promised.

33:36.815 --> 33:37.783
Nice work, Mayor Hayes.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.151
SHERIFF BILL:
Mayor Hayes,

33:39.185 --> 33:40.819
there's something
I want to say to you.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.156
Now, everyone's really
upset about this merger.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.424
Here we go.

33:45.457 --> 33:46.758
I speak for
all of us

33:46.792 --> 33:49.061
when I say that
there isn't anything

33:49.095 --> 33:50.362
we wouldn't do
for BlueBell,

33:50.396 --> 33:51.663
or for you.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.434
Thanks,
Sheriff Bill.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.769
Yeah, well...

33:57.803 --> 33:59.238
I'm not supposed
to be out here.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.639
Breaking
the fourth wall.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.441
Uh, right.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.248
*

34:09.281 --> 34:11.283
(audience applauds)

34:14.820 --> 34:16.655
Hello, there.
Welcome to...

34:16.688 --> 34:19.125
What you doin'?
I'm introducing the cabaret.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.192
TOM:
Oh, good, I could use a drink.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.228
WANDA:
No, I'm introducing
the cab-a-ret,

34:22.261 --> 34:24.096
not cab-er-net.
So you can't drink it?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.664
No, it's a show!
Gesundheit!

34:25.697 --> 34:27.099
(rimshot)
WANDA:
Oh, no, I wasn't...

34:27.132 --> 34:28.234
TOM:
You know what helps

34:28.266 --> 34:29.467
when you're feeling
under the weather?

34:29.501 --> 34:31.237
WANDA:
What helps when you're
feeling under the weather?

34:31.270 --> 34:32.538
An umbrella!
What a joke!

34:32.571 --> 34:34.239
Have you got another?

34:34.273 --> 34:36.275
I can't give you
my other one.
Why not?

34:36.308 --> 34:37.743
I'm saving it for a rainy day.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.379
(scattered laughter)

34:40.411 --> 34:42.414
(applause)
Ha. Ha, ha.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.650
I could only
do so much.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.324
*

34:53.159 --> 34:56.228
* Daisy, Daisy

34:56.262 --> 34:59.365
* Give me your answer, do

34:59.398 --> 35:03.569
* I'm half crazy

35:03.602 --> 35:06.772
* All for the love of you

35:06.805 --> 35:10.709
* It won't be
a stylish marriage *

35:10.742 --> 35:14.513
* I can't afford a carriage

35:14.546 --> 35:16.582
* But you'll look sweet

35:16.615 --> 35:18.550
(material tearing)
* Upon the seat

35:18.584 --> 35:21.520
* Of a bicycle built for two.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.255
(polite applause)

35:28.194 --> 35:29.161
That's it?

35:29.195 --> 35:30.396
Yeah.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.398
Good-bye,
BlueBell.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.533
Yeah.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.635
(audience whispering)

35:37.836 --> 35:41.207
* I'm just...

35:41.240 --> 35:48.280
* A Broadway baby

35:48.314 --> 35:51.883
* Waitin' for
the one big chance *

35:51.917 --> 35:57.356
* To be in a show

35:57.389 --> 35:59.591
* Oh, gee

35:59.625 --> 36:01.660
* I'd like to be

36:01.693 --> 36:03.962
* On some marquee

36:03.995 --> 36:07.299
* All twinkling lights

36:07.333 --> 36:10.602
* A spark to pierce the dark

36:10.636 --> 36:13.372
* From Battery Park

36:13.405 --> 36:16.308
* To Washington Heights
(audience whoops)

36:16.342 --> 36:20.912
* Some day maybe

36:20.946 --> 36:25.484
* All my dreams will be repaid

36:25.517 --> 36:28.787
* Heck, I'd even play the maid

36:28.820 --> 36:31.590
* To be in a...

36:31.623 --> 36:36.295
* Show.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.330
(applause)

36:38.364 --> 36:40.866
(cheering)

36:40.899 --> 36:43.602
Now that is something
I have never seen before.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.972
This is quite
an unusual town.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.820
(people talking, laughing)

37:01.853 --> 37:03.355
Thank you.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.591
Oh, you shouldn't have... hey.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.625
Thanks.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.461
LAVON:
I'm so happy you
enjoyed the show.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.396
I did.
Yeah.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.598
But you know what
stands out even more?

37:12.631 --> 37:15.301
How much the people of
BlueBell love their town.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.868
That message
has come across

37:16.902 --> 37:18.570
loud and clear
since I got here.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.307
These mergers
are actually

37:21.340 --> 37:23.542
Lieutenant Governor Byrd's
pet project.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.043
I'm going
to call my brother

37:25.076 --> 37:27.413
and insist that
he make him come visit.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.647
Oh...

37:28.680 --> 37:29.981
Thank you so much,
Miss Matthews!

37:30.015 --> 37:32.017
Good luck
to you.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.854
(laughs)
We should
celebrate!

37:35.887 --> 37:37.556
Ice cream?
No more ice cream.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.293
But I can think of
another way we
could celebrate.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.394
Oh...
Mm-hmm.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.929
Ooh...

37:43.962 --> 37:45.263
(laughing)

37:46.965 --> 37:48.967
(exhales)

37:51.670 --> 37:52.704
Wade.

37:52.738 --> 37:53.772
Hey.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.574
I hope it's okay
I came by.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.809
I guess I should've
called first.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.345
It's okay.
Harley's sleeping.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.879
What's...
going on?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.348
Well, uh...

38:02.381 --> 38:03.582
I guess...

38:03.615 --> 38:05.751
I'm actually a...
a little confused.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.353
I thought we
were having fun.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.354
I'm into you,

38:08.387 --> 38:09.621
seemed like you
were kind of

38:09.655 --> 38:10.722
into me...
I am.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.424
So what's
the problem?

38:12.458 --> 38:13.825
I don't want to tell you.
I'm embarrassed.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.026
Oh, crap.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.362
(whispering):
Hey, is it contagious?

38:16.395 --> 38:17.763
No.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.598
Truth is,

38:19.631 --> 38:20.999
I didn't want to go
to the cabaret tonight

38:21.032 --> 38:22.868
because it
starts at 9:30.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.570
I'm a single mother.

38:24.603 --> 38:25.971
I have a little boy
who gets me up

38:26.004 --> 38:27.439
at 5:30 in
the morning.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.440
I have a job
that I love

38:28.474 --> 38:29.274
and I can't
afford to lose,

38:29.307 --> 38:31.510
and I wanted to hang,
I tried to hang,

38:31.543 --> 38:33.044
but I just can't,
and I didn't want to tell you

38:33.078 --> 38:34.045
that I'm a tired
old loser.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.981
I can handle
a tired old loser,

38:36.014 --> 38:39.518
you know, especially
when she's as hot

38:39.551 --> 38:40.919
and gorgeous

38:40.952 --> 38:43.021
and all-around hot
and gorgeous as you are.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.022
(laughs)
Yeah?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.457
Oh, yeah.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.460
So...

38:48.494 --> 38:51.397
it is 9:45.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.732
What do you normally
do at 9:45?

38:53.765 --> 38:55.501
I watch TV.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.735
Amazing.
I love TV.

38:56.768 --> 38:57.736
Would you like to come in?

38:57.769 --> 38:58.937
Thought you'd
never ask.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.972
*

39:05.711 --> 39:07.979
TANSY:
Sorry for what
I said about Lynly.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.548
She's sweet.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.583
Despite
the cuckoo-bird eyes.

39:13.485 --> 39:14.386
Okay.

39:14.420 --> 39:17.423
There's a chance
I was more bothered by you

39:17.456 --> 39:19.458
having a new girlfriend
than I wanted to admit.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.795
I get it.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.864
I mean, it was,
uh... (laughs)

39:25.897 --> 39:27.533
it was not easy

39:27.566 --> 39:29.568
for me to see you
with Scooter McGreevy.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.702
But if you
like the guy,

39:30.736 --> 39:32.838
then he's gotta have at least...

39:32.871 --> 39:33.972
I don't know...

39:34.005 --> 39:35.907
one redeeming quality.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.843
Yeah, I don't know.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.845
Maybe he is just a jerk.

39:39.878 --> 39:40.979
Yeah.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.113
Lynly's right.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.715
I... I shouldn't be with someone

39:43.749 --> 39:45.083
just 'cause he's good to my dog.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.521
You cold?
Yeah.

39:49.555 --> 39:50.756
Here.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.724
I...
(clears throat)

39:52.758 --> 39:55.126
am super warm,
so you

39:55.160 --> 39:57.463
can have my sweatshirt.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.464
Thanks.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.632
Free of charge,
all right?

40:00.666 --> 40:01.967
Aw...
That better?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.735
Yeah.
All right.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.504
(sighs)

40:05.537 --> 40:07.773
Sometimes I think
I never should have
let you go.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.911
*

40:24.756 --> 40:27.493
Man, Shelby has got
a set of pipes on her!

40:27.526 --> 40:29.194
I'm sorry that
I've been so crazy.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.663
Hey, for the record,

40:31.697 --> 40:34.232
I completely believe

40:34.265 --> 40:36.101
in your creative
abilities.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.837
It's just that
a musical about biology

40:38.870 --> 40:40.171
didn't seem like
it was gonna get

40:40.205 --> 40:41.840
the best reception
from the...

40:41.873 --> 40:43.174
from the general public.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.544
Just... I need to know
that you know

40:45.577 --> 40:47.178
that I can
do anything.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.615
I do.
Really?

40:49.648 --> 40:51.917
In fact, I'm actually
feeling a little sad

40:51.950 --> 40:53.785
that I didn't get to hear
more of your songs.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.253
What?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.888
Buddy...
Mm-hmm?

40:56.922 --> 40:58.023
...hold on to
your socks!

41:02.794 --> 41:04.195
(clears throat)

41:04.229 --> 41:05.196
*

41:05.230 --> 41:06.532
Oh, boy.

41:06.565 --> 41:07.799
(laughs)

41:07.833 --> 41:10.802
* The minute I ate
that bad beef *

41:10.836 --> 41:13.905
* The contamination
spread through my system *

41:13.939 --> 41:16.608
* You stink, E. coli

41:16.642 --> 41:19.778
* You're a rod-shaped
bacterium *

41:19.811 --> 41:23.715
* You give me nausea,
shakes and delirium *

41:23.749 --> 41:26.184
* You punch me
right in the gut *

41:26.217 --> 41:30.021
* Hurt my head, my butt,
and cause me misery *

41:30.922 --> 41:32.624
* Hey, E. coli

41:33.592 --> 41:35.861
* Spend...

41:35.894 --> 41:37.963
* A little less time with me.

41:39.130 --> 41:42.133
(laughing)
