WEBVTT

00:38.105 --> 00:42.107
We will no longer be forced
to live in darkness,

00:42.109 --> 00:44.343
Brothers and Sisters.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.112
Witness the dawn of a new world.

00:47.114 --> 00:52.051
A world free of lies,
ignorance and corruption.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.402
Satan.

01:43.404 --> 01:48.707
We offer you this sacrifice
as a symbol of our dedication.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.843
Please guide us
on our wee mission

01:50.845 --> 01:52.778
to resurrect your progeny.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.982
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>

01:56.984 --> 02:00.018
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>

02:00.855 --> 02:03.355
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>

02:03.357 --> 02:05.557
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>

02:05.559 --> 02:07.659
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>

02:07.661 --> 02:10.028
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>
- <i>Ave Satan!</i>

02:21.108 --> 02:24.109
So, have you been
thinking about names?

02:24.111 --> 02:26.111
If you have a boy,
what're you gonna name him?

02:27.081 --> 02:28.714
And you better be having a boy.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.149
Yeah, yeah.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.851
Uh, yeah, one of those old
fashioned names like, uh, Levi,

02:32.853 --> 02:35.087
or like Homer or something.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.090
Homer? Over my dead body.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.744
Pardon the intrusion, ma'am.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.612
My name is Aksel Brandr.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.314
I wish to speak
with your husband.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.183
Is he available?

03:04.185 --> 03:08.353
Jacob. He's, he's out fishing,
but he'll be back any minute.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.655
Anything I could do for you?

03:09.657 --> 03:12.057
It's best
that I speak directly with him.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.293
Involves an important
business proposition.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.963
Well, you're welcome
to wait inside.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.298
Much obliged.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.433
Just have a seat.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.638
It shouldn't be
much longer.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.006
I'll go look for him.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.531
Jacob!

03:52.533 --> 03:54.399
There's a young man here
to see you.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.867
Who?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.569
Name is Aksel.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.439
Says he wants to talk to you
about a business proposition.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.662
Mr. Richardson.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.530
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.432
My name is Aksel Brandr.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.935
I'm here on behalf
of my father, Henrik Brandr.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.005
Yes... Nice to meet you.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.507
Askel...

04:36.944 --> 04:38.377
What can I do for you?

04:38.379 --> 04:39.945
Well, I know
you're a busy man, sir.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.546
So I'll get right to it.

04:41.548 --> 04:44.983
My father is very interested
in purchasing your land.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.053
In fact, he's willing to pay
a handsome amount for it.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.655
You name the price.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.692
Well, I appreciate the offer.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.327
I really do, but...

04:57.431 --> 04:59.097
this land ain't for sale...

04:59.867 --> 05:02.100
for any price.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.070
There must be some amount
that could change your mind.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.639
Think of the future your family
could have with this money.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.009
You listen to me, young man.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.414
This is my family's house.

05:16.550 --> 05:20.952
I designed it. I helped build it
with my bare hands.

05:22.623 --> 05:29.027
This land belongs to my family,
Not to your father

05:29.029 --> 05:30.562
or anybody else,
for that matter.

05:34.635 --> 05:39.438
Just exactly, what the hell does
he want with my land, anyway?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.239
He has his reasons.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.008
Is that right?

05:50.351 --> 05:51.450
I'm sorry...

05:53.253 --> 05:55.620
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.225
Well, Mr. Richardson,

06:00.227 --> 06:03.795
I understand that this is
a difficult decision to make.

06:03.797 --> 06:07.432
We'll give you some time to
consider the financial benefits.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.569
In the meantime,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.271
please give my father's regards
to your family.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.208
Here's my card.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.094
Hey.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.863
Hey, hey, how was your day?

06:37.865 --> 06:39.331
Not too bad.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.834
Dad and I, uh,
went fishing, and...

06:42.836 --> 06:44.236
Now we were just hanging out

06:44.238 --> 06:47.339
and they're having drinks,
not me.

06:47.341 --> 06:48.740
But...

06:48.742 --> 06:50.075
<i>Anyway, how are you?</i>

06:50.077 --> 06:52.244
I had to put a mastiff to sleep,
so that was a bummer.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.013
But, uh,
how's your little embryo doing?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.748
Doing just fine.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.552
Hey, Dr. Labelle said it will
probably start kicking in 12 weeks.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.622
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Usually takes about 20 weeks.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.292
God, I wish I could be there
with you right now.

07:08.362 --> 07:09.361
I miss you.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.029
I miss you, too.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.665
You need to get
your ass up here.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.167
I know.

07:15.169 --> 07:18.503
Just three more days, and I will zip
right up there, seven hours non-stop.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.006
And I will make
the sweetest love to you ever.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.108
I can't wait.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.144
God, I swear, it's like
pregnancy makes me

07:26.146 --> 07:28.380
<i>extra horny or something,
honey, I don't know.</i>

07:28.382 --> 07:30.248
Aw, Rebecca,
you are torturing me.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.716
Yeah, you've no idea.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.855
You stop.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.290
Whoa, um...

07:38.826 --> 07:40.559
Hey, I gotta go.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.662
But, I'll call you
later after dinner, okay?

07:44.398 --> 07:45.297
Okay.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.032
Tell them I said, "Howdy."

07:47.034 --> 07:49.167
I will. I love you.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.368
I love you too.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.803
All right, bye.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.405
<i>Bye.</i>

08:01.882 --> 08:03.081
Can I help you?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.733
<i> Hey,</i>
<i>you've reached Rebecca.</i>

08:21.735 --> 08:23.902
<i>Leave me a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.</i>

08:25.339 --> 08:27.973
Hey, honey, I'm about to go
paddle boarding, I've got to go.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.508
Shift doesn't start
for a couple hours.

08:29.510 --> 08:35.080
So, uh, it's a beautiful day
here in Malibu, as always.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.383
Anyway, you're probably still
asleep, so I'll talk to you later.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.851
Love you. Bye.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.682
<i>Hi, this is Mark Neville,</i>

10:50.684 --> 10:52.851
<i>please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

10:54.388 --> 10:55.587
It's voicemail again.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.392
How many times
have you tried calling him?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.897
This is not like him.
I don't know.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.682
Good morning, Jacob.
I need to have a word with Rebecca.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.983
- Is she available?
- Yeah.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.721
What do you need
to talk to her for?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.290
Jacob, I...

11:32.292 --> 11:33.725
I hate to tell you this.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.227
Medical examiners
working on identifying a body

11:36.229 --> 11:37.829
that washed up on the beach
in Malibu.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.435
Given the circumstances,
Rebecca reported last night...

11:43.437 --> 11:45.437
We believe
it may be your son-in-law.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.478
Dad, what's wrong?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.382
Rebecca, they, uh...

11:58.919 --> 12:01.720
They found a body in Malibu.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.689
They need us to go down there and help
'em make a positive identification,

12:04.691 --> 12:07.525
- but it's possible it's not Mark.
- Oh, no.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.427
I hope to God it's not him.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.062
Wh... What happened to him?

12:11.064 --> 12:14.432
Some sort of freak accident it
was, they say, it was a shark bite,

12:14.434 --> 12:16.634
but it might not be Mark.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.837
I'll keep him in my prayers.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.805
Let's hope for the best.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.609
Come on.

12:37.057 --> 12:41.392
Rebecca, honey, you need anything?
Maybe some tea?

12:43.964 --> 12:48.366
Okay, well...
I'll go make some just in case.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.166
Jacob!

13:22.102 --> 13:23.268
What the hell happened?

13:23.270 --> 13:24.736
There was somebody out there.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.745
Lock this door
and call the Sheriff.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.203
What the hell?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.593
Whoever did this is sick.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.195
Hey, John.

14:24.197 --> 14:28.099
Listen, I'm sorry to get you out on
such a God awful night like this.

14:28.101 --> 14:31.102
That's okay. Your family's been
through enough this week.

14:31.104 --> 14:35.773
If anybody's been trespassing on your
property, I'm gonna find out who it is.

14:35.775 --> 14:39.177
I got to tell you, I've never
seen anything like this before.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.579
Why would someone come
all the way out here

14:41.581 --> 14:43.915
to put ashes and dead birds
on your porch?

14:46.219 --> 14:50.388
There was a strange kid that
showed up back, Aksel Brandr.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.190
His father wanted
to buy my property,

14:52.192 --> 14:54.893
but they wouldn't tell me why.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.563
He was really vague about it,
so I refused them.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.565
Of course,
I'm not selling this place.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.901
Did he give anything?
Any information?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.041
He gave me his card.
Aksel Brandr.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.343
Everything's clear. sir.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.779
Okay, good. Thank you.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.915
All right, listen, I'll have
forensics check for any evidence.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.117
If we find anything,
we'll let you know.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.687
In the meantime,
you see anybody trespassing...

15:23.123 --> 15:24.122
give me a call.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.892
I will.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.628
All right. You take care.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.898
Thanks, John.

15:35.835 --> 15:36.834
Thanks, Tommy.

16:37.564 --> 16:41.199
Oh, oh, oh, God.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.169
Oh, God.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.106
Mom!

16:48.108 --> 16:49.273
Rebecca.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.608
What's wrong?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.176
Oh, my God.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.645
- Come on, honey.
- We need to get her to the hospital.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.895
You know,
I don't understand it.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.934
First Mark... Baby.

17:49.936 --> 17:54.238
It's like, uh,
we're being picked off by God himself.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.875
Something evil
has happened, Jacob.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.312
I think someone put a curse
on us last night,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.915
and that's why they left those
terrible things on our porch.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.184
I don't believe
in curses, Elena.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.786
That's nonsense.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.755
Besides, who the hell
would do something like that?

18:12.392 --> 18:15.426
There was something strange
about that young man, Aksel.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.104
- Shit.
- Oh, Rebecca.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.042
<i>Hey, you've reached Rebecca.</i>

18:31.044 --> 18:33.711
<i>Leave me a message and I'll
get back to you soon as I can.</i>

18:51.331 --> 18:53.831
<i>Oh, boy,
you're hiding something, dude.</i>

18:53.833 --> 18:55.299
Mm-hmm.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.236
- Mark, come on, tell me.
- Ah, you're making me nervous.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.570
What were you gonna say?

19:02.041 --> 19:05.076
Well, I've been doing
a lot of thinking...

19:05.078 --> 19:10.882
and, um, I have realized that...

19:13.620 --> 19:16.988
nothing in this universe
matters to me...

19:16.990 --> 19:20.191
if I can't be with you
for the rest of my life.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.094
I love you, Rebecca,

19:23.096 --> 19:26.097
and I want to be
with you forever.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.035
Will you marry me?

19:32.772 --> 19:33.971
Yes.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.374
My God, yes, yes!

22:03.189 --> 22:04.322
Hmm.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.673
Honey, stop.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.042
I'm not in the mood.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.050
Jacob. Jacob, honey, wake up.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.885
- Something's touching me.
- What?

22:34.887 --> 22:36.620
Something's touching my leg.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.958
What?
Something's touching your leg?

22:44.997 --> 22:46.330
Elena.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.265
Jesus Christ.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.369
Don't move.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.672
It's a rattler, honey.
Stay perfectly still.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.341
Shh, don't move.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.976
Don't move.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.378
Stay still.

23:21.334 --> 23:25.102
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.172
- Oh, God, oh, God.
- Elena, Elena. Elena!

23:28.908 --> 23:30.641
We're gonna get you
to a hospital.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.582
Breathe, Elena.
We're almost there.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.785
Jacob...

23:42.889 --> 23:44.522
I don't feel so good.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.123
I know, Elena. I know.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.192
Just hang in there.
We'd be there any minute.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.461
I love you, Jacob.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.430
I love you, Elena.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.499
Hang in there, baby.

24:01.808 --> 24:02.940
Mr. Richardson?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.809
- Yes.
- I'm Dr. Bentley.

24:04.811 --> 24:05.976
Doc, how is she?

24:05.978 --> 24:07.111
Would you come with us?

24:07.713 --> 24:08.746
Well, what?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.952
What do you mean, Doc?
Why can't I see her?

24:14.954 --> 24:18.055
Mr. Richardson,
I want you to understand

24:18.791 --> 24:20.157
we did everything we could,

24:20.159 --> 24:23.060
but your wife,
she just didn't make it.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.263
The...

24:27.033 --> 24:29.800
Because of the location
of the bite,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.570
the venom spread so fast

24:32.572 --> 24:35.706
that there was just
nothing else we could do.

24:37.343 --> 24:39.844
What you mean...
she didn't make...

24:41.214 --> 24:44.315
Because of where the bite was...

24:44.317 --> 24:46.050
Enough!

24:49.922 --> 24:52.189
Again, I'm sorry,
Mr. Richardson.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.326
I'm so sorry.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.194
I'll be right here
if you need anything.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.422
Elena, I'm so sorry.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.826
It should have been me

25:28.828 --> 25:31.328
because you didn't deserve this.

25:38.638 --> 25:42.373
You're my world,
my life.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.409
I always love you.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.147
I promise you,

25:51.551 --> 25:53.851
I will take care
of our little girl.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.923
Promise. I promise.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.728
I love you, Elena,

26:05.865 --> 26:07.698
with all my heart.

26:07.700 --> 26:11.402
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

26:12.939 --> 26:16.173
Oh, God.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.590
Oh, Mark,
please forgive me.

27:57.476 --> 28:01.412
Rebecca? Rebecca?
Are you there?

28:02.081 --> 28:04.281
Mark, is that you?

28:12.458 --> 28:13.524
Mark?

28:19.498 --> 28:20.764
Mark, I'm here.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.568
Oh, my God!

28:26.305 --> 28:28.072
Mark, what's happened?

28:28.074 --> 28:29.840
Rebecca, you have
to get out of here.

28:29.842 --> 28:30.808
They're coming.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.309
- I'm not leaving.
- I don't have time to explain.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.811
- You've to go!
- No!

28:34.380 --> 28:36.680
Rebecca, go! Go!

28:42.354 --> 28:43.954
Hello, Rebecca.

28:44.890 --> 28:45.889
It's you.

28:46.325 --> 28:47.591
Why are you here?

28:47.593 --> 28:50.427
I'm here to guide you
to the other side.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.396
I'm not ready to die.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.732
It is already done, child.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.568
You can't change destiny.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.404
You must accept your fate.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.606
No! Go to hell!

29:46.118 --> 29:49.419
Mark!

29:52.658 --> 29:54.024
Help me.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.629
Rebecca, you're okay.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.932
Daddy's here. I'm here, honey.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.769
I thought I lost you.

30:05.771 --> 30:08.005
I thought I lost you, princess.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.641
Thank you, God. Thank you.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.178
Dad, I saw something.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.547
Saw what?

30:16.549 --> 30:17.981
On the other side...

30:19.351 --> 30:20.884
Mark was there.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.987
And he was suffering terribly.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.190
I saw that man, Aksel,

30:26.192 --> 30:28.492
and there was
an older man with him.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.595
I think it was his father.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.996
I think it was Henrik.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.466
What? What happened?

30:37.770 --> 30:40.037
Henrik tried to lure me to hell.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.207
He said it was my fate.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.044
And then I started burning.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.781
They're causing
all this suffering, Dad.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.618
They'll do anything they can
to destroy us.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.588
There's obviously something
on our land

30:57.590 --> 30:59.156
that they really want.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.861
Your mother tried to tell me
they were evil,

31:06.866 --> 31:09.967
thought they'd put a curse
on our family.

31:17.810 --> 31:20.878
But I wouldn't listen.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.085
I wouldn't listen, baby

31:38.030 --> 31:39.229
The girl lives.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.266
And now she knows who we are.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.534
We have failed Satan.

31:44.536 --> 31:48.272
And he will not grant us
access to his own child...

31:49.174 --> 31:50.874
if we continue to fail him.

31:50.876 --> 31:54.244
Should we take more
direct measures, Father?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.046
In time, Amund. In time.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.449
We must wait
for the right moment.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.585
Until then,
keep a close eye on them.

32:02.922 --> 32:03.954
Bring her in!

32:24.777 --> 32:29.413
Satan, we swear on our lives
that we will not fail again.

32:30.849 --> 32:34.718
Please accept this offering
as a token of our repentance.

32:41.927 --> 32:46.163
<i> Ave Satan.</i>
<i>Ave Satan.</i>

32:47.166 --> 32:51.068
<i> Ave Satan. Ave Satan.</i>

32:51.070 --> 32:53.537
- <i>Ave Satan.</i>
- <i>Ave Satan.</i>

32:53.539 --> 32:56.640
- <i>Ave Satan.</i>
- <i>Ave Satan.</i>

32:56.642 --> 32:58.976
<i> Ave Satan.</i>

33:03.716 --> 33:06.416
Unfortunately, a lot of people
confuse witchcraft

33:06.418 --> 33:10.220
with the fictional caricatures
they see on TV and in novels.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.522
<i>This is quite clearly
one of the reasons</i>

33:12.524 --> 33:15.025
<i>most people disbelieve
in the supernatural.</i>

33:15.027 --> 33:17.294
<i>But the truth
is that witches do exist,</i>

33:17.296 --> 33:18.829
<i>as does magic.</i>

33:18.831 --> 33:21.898
<i>And like all things in life,
magic could be used for good</i>

33:21.900 --> 33:23.233
<i>or it could be used for evil.</i>

33:23.235 --> 33:26.436
<i>Black magic spells
bring death and destruction.</i>

33:26.438 --> 33:28.672
White magic spells
bring healing.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.440
<i>A greatly experienced witch,</i>

33:30.442 --> 33:32.342
<i>which is a high priest
or priestess,</i>

33:32.344 --> 33:34.511
can cast the most
powerful of spells,

33:34.513 --> 33:36.980
even on some
very rare occasions,

33:36.982 --> 33:40.550
<i>a resurrection spell
which can bring back the dead.</i>

33:40.552 --> 33:41.718
But one must understand

33:41.720 --> 33:44.388
that the universe's life force
is limited.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.790
It must be taken
from other living things

33:46.792 --> 33:49.259
and only the most
experienced casters

33:49.261 --> 33:52.496
are able to control where
that life force is taken from.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.865
<i>So it is imperative
that these spells</i>

33:54.867 --> 33:57.200
<i>are only performed
by the right people</i>

33:57.202 --> 33:58.201
<i>for the right reasons.</i>

33:59.738 --> 34:03.106
Hey, I, uh,
just talked to Sheriff.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.208
He's gonna send
one of his deputies over

34:05.210 --> 34:07.344
to watch out for us.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.745
- That's good to know.
- Yep.

34:11.984 --> 34:14.851
Okay, honey, then
I'll just leave you to it.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.903
Hello. Rebecca.
It's very nice to meet you.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.072
Hi. It's nice to meet you too.

34:35.074 --> 34:38.175
Um, thank you so much
for getting back to me.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.076
<i>It's my pleasure.</i>

34:39.078 --> 34:41.411
I, I see that you live
in the Napa Valley.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.747
It's a very beautiful place
to live.

34:43.749 --> 34:47.217
<i>One of my dearest friends
lives in that area too.</i>

34:47.219 --> 34:49.086
What can I do to help you?

34:49.088 --> 34:53.723
Well, I really enjoyed
your video on witchcraft,

34:53.725 --> 34:57.694
and it really inspired me
to want to meet a witch.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.931
Look, this might
sound ridiculous,

35:00.933 --> 35:04.201
but do you know
any real witches?

35:04.803 --> 35:06.036
Because if you do,

35:06.038 --> 35:08.405
then I could
really use their help.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.507
That is an excellent question.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.311
And it is highly probable
that I do know of a real witch.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.912
<i>But it's just not
the kind of information</i>

35:15.914 --> 35:17.414
<i>I give out to just anyone,
willy-nilly.</i>

35:17.416 --> 35:20.784
I'd have to ask you
a whole multitude of questions

35:20.786 --> 35:23.720
just to set up an appointment
with someone like that.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.455
Incidentally...

35:25.457 --> 35:28.692
When we were actually thinking
of meeting this real witch?

35:28.694 --> 35:32.062
Tonight, if possible.
It's very urgent.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.431
<i>Look, please, I'm not trying
to waste your time.</i>

35:34.433 --> 35:36.633
I'll pay you if I need to.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.536
This is very important to me.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.973
Hmm, I think I might know
just the right person for you.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.541
But before we can proceed,

35:44.543 --> 35:48.178
I'm gonna have to ask you
some very detailed questions.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.180
<i>Of course,
I'll answer anything.</i>

35:50.182 --> 35:52.115
<i>Just tell me
what you need to know.</i>

35:56.321 --> 35:58.722
If we don't find this place
in the next five minutes,

35:58.724 --> 35:59.956
we're heading back.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.325
We should be there any minute.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.760
Take a left up here.

36:04.930 --> 36:09.032
Rebecca,
I really don't like this.

36:09.034 --> 36:12.002
Are you sure you have
to talk to a witch priestess?

36:12.738 --> 36:15.839
I just want some answers.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.574
Can't hurt to talk to her, Dad.

36:17.576 --> 36:21.178
All right. But I'm telling you,
it's a complete waste of time.

36:21.180 --> 36:24.848
It's like those TV psychics.
It's fucking rip off.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.050
Okay, it's going to be
right up here on the left.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.553
Yeah, right here.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.508
Rebecca.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.610
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.412
- Nice to meet you.
- Please come in.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.479
Okay.

37:01.920 --> 37:06.022
It can be done,
but I rarely recommend it.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.859
When you bring back the dead,

37:09.861 --> 37:13.263
they might not come back
the person they once were.

37:13.265 --> 37:16.166
There can be
very negative consequences,

37:16.168 --> 37:19.970
especially if that person
doesn't want to be resurrected.

37:21.907 --> 37:25.375
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Yes.

37:25.377 --> 37:28.778
Yes, I'm sure.
Mark meant everything to me.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.147
I would do anything
to be with him again.

37:32.351 --> 37:34.484
Please, I beg you.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.052
Help me bring him back.

37:41.093 --> 37:44.427
Henrik and his followers
are using magic

37:44.429 --> 37:46.062
for all the wrong reasons.

37:48.033 --> 37:51.101
Magic is meant to help people,
not destroy them.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.876
I will revive Mark for you...

38:01.913 --> 38:05.348
because I sense that your heart
is in the right place.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.283
Thank you.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.621
Love is something
no evil can take away.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.724
Now keep in mind,

38:14.726 --> 38:17.127
what we will be doing
is illegal,

38:17.996 --> 38:20.263
some would say immoral.

38:20.265 --> 38:23.199
I need you to go home
and really think about this.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.635
If you decide
to go through with it,

38:25.637 --> 38:26.970
you let me know.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.639
But, Rebecca,

38:32.110 --> 38:34.944
no one can know about this.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.379
No one.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.548
Okay.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.954
Okay. Bye.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.091
So how'd it go?

38:48.093 --> 38:49.526
Is she a kook or what?

38:49.528 --> 38:51.094
No, she's very helpful.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.638
Mornin', Dad.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.041
Hey, honey.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.910
Mornin'.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.046
I need to talk to you
about something,

39:44.549 --> 39:48.651
and you're probably gonna think
it's completely insane.

39:48.653 --> 39:52.288
But I have to tell you.

39:52.290 --> 39:55.058
Well, you know
you can tell me anything.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.394
So just say
what you need to say.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.264
The reason I met with Marybeth

40:02.234 --> 40:04.768
is because she might be
able to bring Mark back.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.771
Bring Mark back?

40:09.374 --> 40:10.907
That's impossible.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.976
I mean, I know
how much you miss him.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.745
Well, I have
to at least try, Dad.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.682
I mean, you know things weren't
supposed to end up like this.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.385
With Marybeth's help,
we could undo some of the damage

40:22.387 --> 40:24.721
- that these people...
- Even if it were possible...

40:27.292 --> 40:30.226
what makes you think it would be
the right thing to do?

40:31.196 --> 40:33.630
It would be disrupting...

40:34.566 --> 40:36.032
Mark's after life.

40:36.034 --> 40:39.068
We'd have to dig him up,
which is illegal.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.471
And not to mention,
it's blasphemous.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.739
I know, Dad.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.175
But I saw Mark on the other side

40:45.177 --> 40:47.644
and he's in terrible pain.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.978
It was a miracle that I'm alive.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.780
You said so yourself.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.117
We just need one more miracle
to set things right again.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.219
If we don't even try,

40:56.221 --> 40:57.720
then what's the fucking point
of all of this?

40:57.722 --> 41:01.191
Just sit on our asses
and wait for them to kill us?

41:01.493 --> 41:02.559
Rebecca?

41:08.934 --> 41:10.233
I'm sorry.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.138
You're all I have left.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.510
I just don't want

41:21.580 --> 41:23.713
someone like Marybeth

41:24.783 --> 41:26.483
to take advantage of you.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.186
You got that?

41:32.157 --> 41:34.324
Do you really need to do this?

41:35.494 --> 41:38.595
Then I'll help you out
however I can, you know.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.397
You know, I'd...

41:42.601 --> 41:44.200
I'd do anything for you.

41:45.437 --> 41:46.436
Thank you, Dad.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.819
Ugh! Oh, oh.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.890
Oh, God.

42:11.663 --> 42:14.297
So much
for the mortician's artistry.

42:16.668 --> 42:18.134
Under no circumstances

42:18.136 --> 42:19.802
should you
interrupt the procedure.

42:20.672 --> 42:23.773
Any interference could
make Mark vulnerable

42:23.775 --> 42:25.308
to dark forces.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.011
Dark forces?

42:28.013 --> 42:30.146
You might know them
as familiar spirits,

42:30.148 --> 42:31.881
as they're referred to
in the Bible.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.585
This should keep them at bay.

42:53.605 --> 42:54.637
Let us begin.

42:58.276 --> 43:01.711
Isis, mother of all,

43:03.348 --> 43:06.449
master of birth,
life and death,

43:06.451 --> 43:07.550
hear us.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.754
You were before time and after,

43:11.756 --> 43:13.623
before knowing and nothing.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.560
Accept the offering, Isis.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.629
Know our prayers.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.534
Accept the offering, Isis.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.604
Let him cross over.

43:29.708 --> 43:31.341
Let him cross over!

43:32.844 --> 43:34.410
Release him, Isis!

43:35.814 --> 43:37.413
Release him!

44:07.278 --> 44:09.379
Son of a bitch.

44:10.682 --> 44:11.914
Mark is alive.

44:13.018 --> 44:14.684
But he's in a catatonic state.

44:15.387 --> 44:17.020
Give him time to rest.

44:17.022 --> 44:20.390
His body needs to recover
from his unnatural resurgence.

44:21.459 --> 44:23.326
Tomorrow he shall awaken anew.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.496
You don't know
what this means to me.

44:26.498 --> 44:27.597
Thank you.

45:01.733 --> 45:03.599
Rest up.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.968
Tomorrow is the first day
of your new life.

45:08.973 --> 45:10.006
Now remember,

45:11.276 --> 45:12.975
you must keep this a secret.

45:12.977 --> 45:16.345
Mark cannot return
to the world he once inhabited.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.448
It would be
too dangerous for him.

45:18.450 --> 45:20.616
Don't worry.
I won't let him out of my sight.

45:20.618 --> 45:22.318
Good.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.953
I brought you
supplies for the weekend.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.827
I'll bring more on Monday.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.628
Just remember
that these will only help

45:32.630 --> 45:34.530
keep evil out of your house.

45:34.532 --> 45:36.265
Henrik's followers
could still come back here

45:36.267 --> 45:37.934
and if they do,
you better call the police.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.736
Oh, don't worry about that.

45:39.738 --> 45:42.538
Sheriff's very sympathetic
of our situation.

45:43.341 --> 45:44.607
Happy to hear that.

46:00.225 --> 46:01.624
Did Henrik's cult specify

46:01.626 --> 46:03.760
why your land
is so important to them?

46:04.395 --> 46:07.563
No, he was very vague about it.

46:07.565 --> 46:10.466
Do you know if there's anything
buried beneath your garage?

46:10.468 --> 46:13.836
There was a hidden
old well during construction.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.173
It's been sealed off and buried

46:17.175 --> 46:20.276
for what looked like centuries.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.211
So we didn't think
it was that important,

46:22.213 --> 46:23.780
so we just covered it up.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.548
Oh, my God, Dad,

46:25.550 --> 46:27.283
there could be
something really horrible

46:27.285 --> 46:28.317
buried down there

46:28.319 --> 46:30.186
and all this time,
we had no idea?

46:30.188 --> 46:31.387
I gotta go.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.526
No matter what happens,
do not let them near that well.

46:38.263 --> 46:39.662
We won't.

46:39.664 --> 46:41.497
Thank you
for everything, Marybeth.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.533
You can thank me
by protecting that well.

46:43.535 --> 46:44.967
Take care of Mark for me.

46:46.104 --> 46:47.103
Good night.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.768
- You want some...
- Yes, sir.

47:59.911 --> 48:01.844
Uh, Mark?

48:03.681 --> 48:04.614
Mark.

48:06.751 --> 48:08.484
- I'm really here.
- Yeah.

48:12.357 --> 48:13.856
Rebecca.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.869
I wish we could just leave
and never come back.

48:26.871 --> 48:29.605
And then maybe they'd
just leave us alone.

48:29.607 --> 48:32.041
No, they'll come find us.

48:32.043 --> 48:34.043
We know too much.

48:34.045 --> 48:38.547
Rebecca, I promise you, if they
come back here, I'll kill them all.

48:38.549 --> 48:39.949
I'm not afraid of them.

48:40.485 --> 48:41.951
I'm not afraid to die.

48:42.854 --> 48:45.955
I promise you,
I will do anything I can

48:45.957 --> 48:47.123
to keep you safe.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.093
Oh shit, it's the Sheriff.

48:53.965 --> 48:56.432
Dad, the sheriff's here.

48:56.434 --> 48:57.767
Come on.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.971
You stay in there and be quiet.

49:11.516 --> 49:12.682
Hey, John.

49:12.917 --> 49:13.983
Jacob.

49:13.985 --> 49:15.785
What's going on?

49:15.787 --> 49:18.054
Someone stole the body
from the cemetery.

49:18.056 --> 49:18.988
Mark's body.

49:18.990 --> 49:21.257
Oh, my God.

49:21.259 --> 49:23.259
Mind if I come inside
and sit down for a moment?

49:24.629 --> 49:26.329
Oh, no, of course not.

49:26.331 --> 49:27.330
Come on

49:29.534 --> 49:30.766
Have a seat.

49:33.171 --> 49:34.370
Jacob.

49:34.372 --> 49:35.871
I think the people
that took Mark's body

49:35.873 --> 49:37.974
are the same people
that have been harassing you.

49:38.743 --> 49:41.677
That Aksel and Henrik Brandr...

49:41.679 --> 49:43.546
Well, have you found
anything on him?

49:43.548 --> 49:45.114
Nothing we could
use against them.

49:45.750 --> 49:46.983
No criminal record.

49:46.985 --> 49:49.819
No lawsuits. They're completely
under the radar.

49:50.521 --> 49:52.588
Look, I can't prove it, yet.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.190
But I know they're responsible

49:54.192 --> 49:57.393
for these damn tragedies,
my families and probably

49:57.395 --> 49:59.061
your other problems, too.

50:00.732 --> 50:02.264
I'm starting to believe you.

50:02.266 --> 50:03.899
Well, that's good.

50:03.901 --> 50:06.702
We haven't had so much as a traffic
violation these past few years.

50:07.538 --> 50:10.206
Ever since that
Aksel visited you,

50:10.208 --> 50:12.174
I got two girls go missing.

50:12.176 --> 50:16.045
And with your family's tragedies
and his body snatching,

50:16.047 --> 50:20.216
it's just... the coincidence
is too big to ignore.

50:21.285 --> 50:22.518
What about the cemetery?

50:22.520 --> 50:25.755
Did you find any evidence?

50:26.424 --> 50:27.790
Nothing we can pin on them.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.060
Had to make sure not to leave
anything behind.

50:34.465 --> 50:37.366
Well, just let me know if
there's anything we can do to...

50:37.368 --> 50:39.035
Listen, uh...

50:39.037 --> 50:40.036
I gotta head out.

50:42.907 --> 50:44.807
Please tell Rebecca
I said hello.

50:44.809 --> 50:45.941
Okay.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.984
It's stressful.
You're supposed to be dead.

50:56.854 --> 50:58.354
Yeah, that was close.

51:00.691 --> 51:02.858
I can't believe
you did this for me.

51:04.662 --> 51:06.762
Must have cost a fortune
for you to save me.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.832
Yeah, it costs
an arm and a leg.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.768
- Mm-hmm.
- No offense.

51:13.204 --> 51:14.837
None taken.

51:17.075 --> 51:20.342
Are you sure you're not
weirded out by me being back?

51:24.582 --> 51:26.749
Mark, I will always love you.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.418
No matter what.

51:30.988 --> 51:32.254
I promise.

51:44.168 --> 51:46.435
Oh, I've missed you.

51:59.650 --> 52:02.151
I'm still getting used to this.

52:02.153 --> 52:04.753
- Looks kind of like chewed up bubble gum.
- Yeah.

52:04.755 --> 52:06.288
Does it hurt?

52:06.290 --> 52:08.424
I don't feel a thing. It's uh...

52:08.426 --> 52:09.859
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

52:09.861 --> 52:11.627
It's almost like it's magic.

52:12.763 --> 52:15.030
Exactly.

52:15.032 --> 52:19.535
Speaking of magic, I'm really
getting attached to this blade

52:19.537 --> 52:21.337
you got me.
That's a pretty serious.

52:22.006 --> 52:22.872
Oh, my God.

52:22.874 --> 52:24.907
That's from Marybeth.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.742
What the hell was that?

52:27.545 --> 52:29.411
I'll find out. Stay here, okay.

52:35.586 --> 52:36.719
What the hell is wrong?

52:36.721 --> 52:37.887
Well, shit, they're here.

52:37.889 --> 52:40.055
Look, call the Sheriff.
Stay with Rebecca.

52:40.057 --> 52:42.158
- Mark, stay with her.
- I will.

52:42.160 --> 52:45.494
Those bastards have fucked
with us for the last time.

52:45.496 --> 52:46.962
Be careful.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.173
Rebecca, we're here to help.

52:57.175 --> 53:00.910
We want to believe you,
but we need to know the truth.

53:00.912 --> 53:02.311
What happened at the cemetery?

53:03.181 --> 53:06.549
We just, we went to visit
Mark's grave.

53:06.551 --> 53:09.185
We said a prayer
and then we left.

53:09.187 --> 53:10.853
That was it.

53:10.855 --> 53:13.522
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Oh, shit.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.891
What do we do, sir?
He might be a fucking zombie.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.326
Lower your weapons.

53:17.895 --> 53:19.395
What's going on here?

53:19.397 --> 53:20.663
Mark, what the fuck!

53:20.665 --> 53:22.431
Sorry, but I can't stay
locked up forever.

53:22.433 --> 53:24.133
Especially a time like this.

53:35.947 --> 53:38.247
I don't want
to freak you guys out anymore.

53:38.249 --> 53:41.584
But I figured
if anything gets too crazy...

53:42.820 --> 53:44.286
We could use these.

53:44.288 --> 53:46.789
Johnson, what the hell
are you doing with dynamite?

53:46.791 --> 53:48.157
My dad worked in demolition.

53:48.159 --> 53:50.092
I just figured these might
come in handy.

53:50.094 --> 53:52.328
You know, if anything
gets too crazy.

53:52.330 --> 53:56.165
Put that shit down.
One bullet hits that bag, we're all dead.

53:56.167 --> 53:57.333
Yes, sir.

53:57.335 --> 53:58.500
I'll hide him under here

54:19.290 --> 54:20.456
Oh, fuck.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.557
Adams, call for backup.

54:25.963 --> 54:26.962
I can't get a signal, sir.

54:26.964 --> 54:28.197
It's all fucked up.

54:29.133 --> 54:30.366
Rebecca...

54:31.168 --> 54:32.534
Rebecca...

54:37.475 --> 54:38.607
We don't have time to waste.

54:38.609 --> 54:41.610
We should split up. Two people
on each side of the house.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.746
Don't let anyone in the garage.

54:43.748 --> 54:45.881
Adams, you stay with me.
Give Mark your radio.

54:45.883 --> 54:47.516
Everyone, be careful.

54:51.289 --> 54:52.588
Let's go.

54:52.590 --> 54:53.622
We'll take the West.

54:56.894 --> 54:58.527
Don't be afraid.

54:58.529 --> 55:00.596
Satan himself is with us.

55:01.432 --> 55:02.965
Prepare to attack.

55:05.236 --> 55:06.235
Go.

55:12.943 --> 55:15.577
<i>I think I saw
something by the trees. East side.</i>

55:19.817 --> 55:21.116
Oh, shit!

55:21.118 --> 55:22.084
Adams!

55:24.322 --> 55:25.354
Adams is dead.

55:25.356 --> 55:26.622
Shoot to kill

55:26.624 --> 55:28.357
Come on, bloodsuckers!

55:34.231 --> 55:35.831
<i>Don't forget
about my bag.</i>

55:35.833 --> 55:37.633
<i>You know what to do with it.</i>

55:37.635 --> 55:39.301
Shit. They're in the garage.

55:45.509 --> 55:46.508
I'm going in.

55:54.685 --> 55:55.684
Come on.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.491
Can you hit me,
without hitting him?

56:03.761 --> 56:05.060
Mark!

56:24.115 --> 56:26.715
You're making a big fucking
mistake, you know that?

56:29.253 --> 56:30.552
Am I?

56:31.789 --> 56:35.190
I could kill you
so fucking easily.

56:35.192 --> 56:39.061
You pathetic fucking weakling!

57:02.119 --> 57:04.153
Leave him the fuck alone!

57:12.630 --> 57:15.664
You naive...

57:16.200 --> 57:20.669
cunting little... whore.

57:28.546 --> 57:30.646
You have no idea...

57:30.648 --> 57:37.085
of the horrors waiting for you in
your little shopping mall world.

57:40.324 --> 57:45.694
Because you and your kind...

57:46.864 --> 57:50.132
Have ruined everything

57:50.134 --> 57:52.468
that was beautiful
in this world.

57:55.606 --> 57:56.738
But your time's come.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.107
That's right.

57:59.877 --> 58:02.277
Your time has come.

58:02.279 --> 58:05.180
Atone for your sins.

58:11.555 --> 58:12.754
Do you hear that?

58:13.958 --> 58:15.858
Do you hear that?

58:20.164 --> 58:21.530
They're ready for you.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.701
Now, you're just complying.

58:28.606 --> 58:29.872
If you wanna die

58:29.874 --> 58:32.641
with a semblance
of fucking dignity...

58:44.688 --> 58:46.188
Am gonna cut off

58:46.190 --> 58:50.692
your fucking tits
and shovel up, you motherfuck.

59:30.701 --> 59:32.200
Holy shit.

59:32.202 --> 59:34.469
How's that for dignity,
fuck face?

59:35.105 --> 59:36.538
Thank God you're all right.

59:46.884 --> 59:49.117
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

59:49.119 --> 59:51.253
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

59:51.255 --> 59:53.055
We have to get out of here. Now.

59:53.057 --> 59:54.222
Rebecca, go with Marybeth.

59:54.224 --> 59:55.857
No, I'm not leaving you.

59:55.859 --> 59:56.858
I can't lose you.

59:57.461 --> 59:58.360
Go.

59:58.362 --> 1:00:00.195
Whatever is down there
must be stopped.

1:00:00.197 --> 1:00:01.630
I'll put an end to this.

1:00:01.632 --> 1:00:03.899
- Mark, don't leave me.
- No, he is right.

1:00:03.901 --> 1:00:05.434
If we stay here,
we're gonna perish.

1:00:05.436 --> 1:00:07.235
Everything you've been through
will be in vain.

1:00:07.237 --> 1:00:08.804
Mark, you can't do this.

1:00:08.806 --> 1:00:10.439
I have to do this.

1:00:10.441 --> 1:00:13.308
Please, let me honor the life
that you have given me.

1:00:13.711 --> 1:00:14.710
Go.

1:00:15.913 --> 1:00:16.878
Go.

1:00:20.317 --> 1:00:22.317
Don't you die again.

1:00:25.856 --> 1:00:26.855
Now go...

1:00:26.857 --> 1:00:27.990
Go.

1:00:28.792 --> 1:00:30.459
Please... go.

1:00:32.196 --> 1:00:33.462
Good luck.

1:01:09.433 --> 1:01:10.432
God.

1:01:11.268 --> 1:01:12.968
Please don't let me
screw this up.

1:01:15.305 --> 1:01:17.472
Please let me see Rebecca again.

1:01:43.233 --> 1:01:47.335
Satan,
please accept this offering.

1:01:47.337 --> 1:01:50.572
May it nourish
your sleeping child.

1:01:51.975 --> 1:01:55.410
Son of Lucifer, awake.

1:01:55.412 --> 1:01:57.746
Avenge your betrayed Father.

1:02:00.851 --> 1:02:02.084
Fuck you, Henrik.

1:02:03.887 --> 1:02:05.954
No! Extinguish it!

1:02:05.956 --> 1:02:07.589
We mustn't lose the child!

1:02:07.591 --> 1:02:08.924
Fuck you!

1:02:19.670 --> 1:02:21.503
Damn you, Mark!

1:02:21.505 --> 1:02:26.041
Curse you and your family
by the power of Satan himself!

1:02:26.043 --> 1:02:27.943
Do you hear me?

1:02:27.945 --> 1:02:29.845
You'll be cursed for eternity.

1:02:38.589 --> 1:02:39.387
Father...

1:02:39.389 --> 1:02:40.722
Fa...

1:02:46.630 --> 1:02:50.899
Let the pain leave you, my son.

1:03:03.313 --> 1:03:07.849
Please... Awake... Please.

1:03:08.786 --> 1:03:10.152
I beg of you.

1:03:11.255 --> 1:03:14.156
Don't let our suffering
be in vain.

1:03:15.192 --> 1:03:16.792
We've served you well.

1:03:17.995 --> 1:03:21.730
Arise... Arise, I command you.

1:03:43.921 --> 1:03:45.554
Oh, thank you, Father.

1:03:45.556 --> 1:03:47.923
Thank you for hearing my cries.

1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:53.061
Thank you for accepting
our offerings.

1:03:55.098 --> 1:03:59.801
Please let me serve you.

1:03:59.803 --> 1:04:04.673
I humbly beg to be your servant
for the rest of my life.

1:05:21.151 --> 1:05:22.517
Thank you.

1:05:34.464 --> 1:05:35.563
Oh, yeah.

1:05:35.565 --> 1:05:37.999
I mean, I pointed it
right at his head,

1:05:38.001 --> 1:05:43.705
and his brain just turned into
this bloody oatmeal like mush.

1:05:43.707 --> 1:05:46.174
It came out of every orifice
in his head.

1:05:47.044 --> 1:05:48.576
It was insane.

1:05:48.578 --> 1:05:50.312
<i>Oh, my God. That is insane.</i>

1:05:50.314 --> 1:05:53.648
<i>I can honestly say I've never heard
of that one being done before.</i>

1:05:53.650 --> 1:05:55.216
<i>So it worked pretty well then.</i>

1:05:55.218 --> 1:05:58.219
Oh. It was so effective
and fast.

1:05:58.221 --> 1:06:00.255
It was just so messy.

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:02.824
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.</i>

1:06:02.826 --> 1:06:05.226
<i>It's just this whole thing.
Such an incredible story.</i>

1:06:05.228 --> 1:06:07.896
<i>I mean, you really should let
me write the book on this.</i>

1:06:07.898 --> 1:06:10.532
<i>It would make an absolute killing up
here, I can assure you.</i>

1:06:10.534 --> 1:06:13.368
Yeah, but you better
get over that book idea

1:06:13.370 --> 1:06:16.504
because I'm gonna make your
brain sieve out of your head.

1:06:16.506 --> 1:06:18.206
<i>Okay. Okay. I'll forget it.</i>

1:06:18.208 --> 1:06:19.207
<i>Calm down.</i>

1:06:19.209 --> 1:06:21.309
<i>Just glad you're all okay.
That's the thing.</i>

1:06:21.311 --> 1:06:22.577
Good morning.

1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:24.145
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:06:26.016 --> 1:06:27.382
<i>So, is Mark still...</i>

1:06:27.384 --> 1:06:29.084
He just woke up.

1:06:29.086 --> 1:06:29.918
I gotta go.

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:32.120
<i>Okay.
I'll talk to you later then.</i>

1:06:32.122 --> 1:06:33.054
<i>Goodbye, Rebecca.</i>

1:06:33.056 --> 1:06:35.623
- <i>Say hello to Mark for me.</i>
- Bye.

1:06:37.461 --> 1:06:39.894
I see somebody is awake.

1:06:42.366 --> 1:06:45.000
How do you feel?

1:06:45.002 --> 1:06:47.102
Like I have
a hangover from hell.

1:06:48.739 --> 1:06:52.307
Next time, just let me die
for fuck's sake.

1:06:52.309 --> 1:06:53.742
I'm never gonna let you die.

1:06:53.744 --> 1:06:56.144
So you're just gonna have
to suck it up.

1:06:56.513 --> 1:06:57.712
Mark?

1:06:58.982 --> 1:06:59.981
Is it all over?

1:07:00.751 --> 1:07:03.752
Whatever was down there is dead.

1:07:03.754 --> 1:07:06.121
Along with the rest
of its adoring fan base.

1:07:06.690 --> 1:07:08.189
Boom all straight to hell.

1:07:11.728 --> 1:07:13.328
I will need to read your hands.

1:07:14.998 --> 1:07:18.033
We have to make sure
the curse has been lifted.
