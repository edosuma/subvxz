BARBIE: A few weeks ago, an invisible
dome crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.966
Why the dome is here
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.549
we still don 't know.
Every day it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.965
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.180
Some say we '/I be
stuck here forever,

00:21.980 --> 00:25.564
but we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.689
- Melanie Cross. 1988.
- It's me.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.855
It's some kind of energy source.
That egg needs to go, now.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.612
No!

00:35.786 --> 00:37.822
Melanie! Melanie!

00:37.996 --> 00:39.406
The way to Zenith is blocked?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.162
Oh, it's more than blocked. It's gone.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.824
- Then we can be a family again.
- You're a liar.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.038
You're working for the guy
who held us captive.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.453
- Phil!
- Lyle?

00:47.631 --> 00:49.371
PAULINE: Now that we're back,
whatever's gonna happen,

00:49.550 --> 00:50.585
we need Lyle.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.045
- The dome's contracting.
- You mean it's shrinking?

00:57.808 --> 01:00.845
JOE: I don't know why,
but it keeps starting and stopping.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.053
At least the dome stopped spinning
and inverting the atmosphere.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.516
That's why the temperature's up.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.182
- Yeah, but now it's shrinking.
- First that earthquake struck,

01:08.360 --> 01:10.476
then it got super cold in here,
and now this.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.064
You think the dome
could be evolving?

01:12.239 --> 01:15.026
- And into what?
- I don't know.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.610
HUNTER:
Why is it moving again?

01:17.119 --> 01:18.780
Look, I will figure it out, okay?

01:18.954 --> 01:21.491
In the meantime, spread word to
get people to the center of town.

01:21.665 --> 01:25.328
Use walkies, go to their houses,
just get them there. Now.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.795
"To everything there is a season,

01:30.966 --> 01:34.424
and a time to every purpose
under the heaven.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.345
A time to be born, a time to die.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.676
A time to plant,

01:40.851 --> 01:43.433
a time to pluck that which...

01:44.730 --> 01:46.721
...is planted."

01:47.649 --> 01:49.640
Thank God it's warming up again.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.683
Whatever happens,
we'll get through it together,

01:51.862 --> 01:53.102
if that's what you want.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.317
PAULINE: Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.359
- It can't be the egg, though, right?
- No, it's something else.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.990
Lyle. You should be resting
after everything you've been through.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.750
You hear that?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.247
Huh?

02:10.422 --> 02:13.539
I think we're all gonna be
resting pretty soon.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.751
Did Jim tell you about what I saw?

02:16.928 --> 02:19.419
A fresh vision of hell
on my way back here.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.930
PAULINE: Yeah, he did.
You've been through a lot,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.477
which is all the more reason
for you to rest.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.681
There's a cot
down this hallway, come on.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.181
Well, I'll follow
you anywhere, Pauline.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.119
Hi.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.286
Hey. You're awake.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.000
It's good to see you too.

02:56.885 --> 03:01.094
- How do you feel?
- Better, I think.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.552
- It seems warmer.
- Cold snap's over.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.892
But...

03:08.980 --> 03:12.438
James, I can tell
something else is wrong.

03:12.609 --> 03:16.193
I think the dome's
closing in around us.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.480
- What?
- We're gonna figure out how to stop it,

03:19.658 --> 03:22.149
and we'll find out
how to get you better.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.623
Actually, I think I know where I might
be able to get some answers.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.117
Go.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.460
I'll be fine.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.221
I'll send someone to sit with you.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.776
Come on, around this way,
get to the high school, all right?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.686
- You'll be safe there.
JOE: You seeing this?

03:59.865 --> 04:01.947
Yeah, Joe, | see
what's happening with the dome.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.778
I'm just helping people
out of their homes.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.819
- Let's regroup back at the school.
- Talk to you soon.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.134
You should take that.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.220
He was your husband.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.883
That was my old life.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.932
Can you, uh,
pass me Pauline's journal?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.892
Just there.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.724
Thanks.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.066
The dome has taken
so much from all of us.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.527
Now this.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.109
All that matters is that we survive.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.072
And we're going to.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.787
Yeah, we're gonna give it
our damndest.

[RUMBUNG]

04:57.422 --> 04:58.958

05:00.842 --> 05:04.300
- Oh, my God, it's close.
- Let's go this way. Let's go.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.596
Did I hear that the dome
is contracting?

05:08.767 --> 05:12.009
- Yeah. Saw it with my own eyes.
- How fast is it moving?

05:12.187 --> 05:13.677
I'm still doing the calculations, Jim,

05:13.855 --> 05:17.188
so just do what you do best,
keep people calm, and--

05:18.693 --> 05:21.435
Hey.
Welcome to our new nightmare.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.069
Well, that's stating the obvious.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.777
I figured out that at its present rate
of stopping and starting,

05:25.951 --> 05:28.067
- it won't be long before the dome--
- Crushes us?

05:28.245 --> 05:30.861
- Here, I'll take that.
- The way every house,

is gonna pile up inside here,

the walls get to us.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.913
| just can't believe that.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.498
Big Jim threw the egg off the cliff,

05:39.673 --> 05:41.629
I'd say that proves
it's the dome's power source.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.461
No, I mean that
the dome would kill us all.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.594
Oh, because the dome told you
it's here to protect us, right?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.220
You think I imagined that?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.131
I don't know,
but it'd be nice to have proof.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.133
Look, I appreciate
what you do, all right?

05:53.311 --> 05:55.472
You've helped all of us.
But with everything we've seen,

there's more going on--

05:57.357 --> 05:59.643
- Okay, I'm--
- Now's not the time to debate this.

05:59.818 --> 06:03.402

- Okay. You're right. Excuse me.

- Let's help everybody settle in.
NORRIE: Barbie. Julia.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.150
JULIA: Glad you guys are safe.
- We're not so sure.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.360
- What do you mean?
JOE: Hunter here

06:12.539 --> 06:14.154
has something
he would like to confess.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.493
Isn't that right, Hunter?

06:17.043 --> 06:20.535
Look, when I came back
from Zenith with you, l was...

06:20.714 --> 06:22.500
l was secretly working for your Dad.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.798
What?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.093
He blackmailed me
into spying on you.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.845
To find a way to
get the egg to Zenith,

06:31.016 --> 06:33.132
which I never got to do
because Big Jim tossed it.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.598
- Look, I am on your side. I swear.
NORRIE: Barbie, it's true.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.022
Hunter stopped that military guy

06:38.189 --> 06:40.145
outside the dome from doing
experiments on the egg

06:40.317 --> 06:42.979
because he knew
it was hurting Melanie.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.185
There's gonna be more people hurt

06:45.363 --> 06:47.649
if we don't find a way to
stop these walls from shrinking.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.189

the hardware store

- He's dead.

about how she hates this place

08:13.994 --> 08:16.861

everything is gonna be okay.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.617
- Norrie. Let's go.
- Why?

08:23.795 --> 08:25.535
I saw Barbie leading Hunter
away from school.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.875
- Barbie did not look happy.
- Where are they going?

I don't know, that's why
we have to follow them.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.755
Well, whatever they're up to,
Barbie didn't want us coming along.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.511
If it's Barbie, he's probably got
a plan to stop what's happening.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.923
Don't you wanna
see what he's up to?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.511
But why do we have to go home?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.051
Maybe one of your paintings
shows us

08:41.229 --> 08:42.844

- What, comforting Lyle?
- Is that what this is about?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.403
He's out of his gourd.
And his was soft to begin with.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.314

from drowning?

08:54.492 --> 08:58.030
No. I mean, you wanted him here,

Maybe. Any other symptoms?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.607
All I know is
when the egg disappeared,

12:23.785 --> 12:26.151
her health went downhill.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.075
- How's her blood look?
- Same way she does.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.411
Her red blood cells
seem to be disintegrating.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.993
A transfusion might
buy her some time.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.458
Yeah, except if we give her
the wrong type, it'll kill her.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.875
Well, that's a risk we have to take. We
don't have the equipment to type blood.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.798
- Lima beans.
- Come again?

12:47.976 --> 12:51.059
The lectins in lima beans, they react
to the surface of red blood cells.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.515
If we mash them up,
mix them with the blood,

12:53.690 --> 12:55.055
we can determine blood type.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.609
Let's just hope she responds
to a transfusion.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.404
- Why wouldn't she?
- Has anyone told you about this girl?

13:04.158 --> 13:05.489
What about her?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.284
It's a weird story.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.281
Come on. I bet Andrea
has lima beans at her house.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.074
Junior.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.582
Oh, God. She is worse.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.917
- We're doing everything we can.
- Me too.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.333
Do you know where
my mom's journal is?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.842
It's in that box.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.804
Why?

13:29.934 --> 13:30.969
James?

13:38.443 --> 13:41.059
I can't believe
we lucked out like this.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.602
Thank God for hoarders, right?

13:42.780 --> 13:46.113
Right. So you wanna tell me
this weird story about Melanie?

13:46.284 --> 13:49.276
Which part? How she was
my high school girlfriend?

13:49.454 --> 13:52.867
Or how she died 25 years ago
but is now alive again?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.699
- Excuse me?
- You asked.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.913
Sam, people don't die
and come back to life.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.123
I mean, they can be
medically resuscitated,

14:00.298 --> 14:02.289
but not after two decades.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.550
And yet here she is.
And that is the girl I knew.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.380
Your sister faked her own death.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.386
I don't know,
maybe Melanie somehow--

14:09.557 --> 14:11.388
Rebecca, I saw her die.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.424
And I know death when | see it.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.100
Why the stupid grin, Lyle?

14:22.653 --> 14:25.269
| see you have an eye now
for your mother's artwork.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.611
The real question is
why she ever had eyes for you.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.660
Your mother saw that she needed
someone to nurture her gifts,

14:32.830 --> 14:35.082
- not doubt them.
- And you're that someone?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.830
Well, it wasn't your dad.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.497
She sent me those postcards
for the last nine years.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.127
You know why?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.584
Because she trusted me
to understand them.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.716
You want me to do
the same thing for you?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.252
Why?

14:50.139 --> 14:52.596
To make up for hitting you
with a fire poker,

14:52.767 --> 14:54.723
and for stealing the journal.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.635
Okay.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.980
Find something in here
that might help Melanie.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.362
That's you and Sam, my mom,
and Melanie, right?

15:07.532 --> 15:10.695
On the way to the crater,
25 years ago.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.199
That's the night Melanie died.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.201
That's not gonna happen again.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.112
If only you knew what I know.

15:18.042 --> 15:22.877
- Junior, we're all gonna die inside this.
- Just focus on the drawings.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.998
I'm not seeing anything.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.712
Are you sure?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.047
You didn't paint a vision
of a new tunnel?

15:31.222 --> 15:32.928
Or a hole in the dome somewhere?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.215
lfl had, we would
have found it by now.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.304
Listen, we are not gonna
get crushed in this dome

15:37.478 --> 15:39.514
because I screwed up
and threw that egg over.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.645
There's gotta be something here.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.727
SAM:
You okay?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.146
REBECCA: Yeah. Just glad
I'm the right blood type.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.231
All right. Give me a shout
if you need anything.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.354
Thanks.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.235
What's going on?

15:55.413 --> 15:58.029
Oh, we're transfusing you.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.415
I'm gonna find out why you're sick.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.036
Not knowing makes you mad, huh?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.546
A little.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.719
My mom used to kiss my forehead
when she took my temperature.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.548
Did your mom do that?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.842
I don't remember.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.761
She died when l was 8.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.184
I'm sorry.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.314
I wanted a reason.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.064
Someone to tell me why
she was taken from me.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.609
Maybe some questions
have no answers.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.783
You sound like Julia.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.993
Is that such a bad thing?

16:42.710 --> 16:45.452
There's a better thing, Melanie.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.708
Knowing.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.464
People have always
wondered about the world.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.051
Why the sun rises and sets.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.339
Why spring turns to summer
and then autumn.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.220
Why loved ones get sick.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.936
How to make them better.

17:04.565 --> 17:08.604
You know, knowing the answers
doesn't take away the wonder.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.064
It actually makes it more amazing.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.365
Then tell me why I'm dying.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.153
Because I'm notjust sick, am I?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.118
I'm dying.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.825
- Listen--
- All that matters,

17:26.754 --> 17:29.541
is the first time I died

17:30.383 --> 17:32.795
l was all alone.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.881
Now l have you

17:36.973 --> 17:39.089
and Julia,

17:39.684 --> 17:41.766
and my brother.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.848
It was worth coming back,

17:48.025 --> 17:50.186
just for that.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.154
HUNTER:
It's stopping again.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.390
Hey, your plan worked.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.727
We need the egg back, now!

18:38.409 --> 18:42.277
Son, you know
I'd do anything to help.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.487
But I can't make that happen.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.246
All right, well, then your son
and your daughter die in here!

19:00.348 --> 19:02.304
Melanie disappeared years ago.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.893
No. She's alive.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.521
In here. With us.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.816
No, that can't be possible.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.031
Joe! Norrie.
Get your asses out here.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.284
How'd you know
we were following you?

19:31.462 --> 19:33.498
Because stealth
is not your strong suit. Hey.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.506
Listen, I need to convince
my dad about Melanie, okay?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.337
So do you have any photos, or...?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.672
I got something better: vlog.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.379
Yeah. Show him.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.343
JOE [ON MONITOR]:
How do you like it so far?

19:45.518 --> 19:48.681
MELANIE: Everyone's so sad.
- Yeah.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.481
Is there something I can do to help?

19:54.652 --> 19:55.687
BARBIE:
That's enough.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.898
How?

19:59.073 --> 20:00.984
BARBIE:
Because that egg brought her back.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.108
Without that here
in Chester's Mill, she dies,

20:04.286 --> 20:06.663
and all of us die too.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.492
[RUMBUNG]

20:10.501 --> 20:12.082
It's starting again.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.171
Barbie, he isn't getting it.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.334
Tell him it's more than just a thing.
It's alive somehow. It knows us.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.003
Barbie, the egg is upset being
out there. If he gives it back,

20:24.181 --> 20:26.558
- this could be our way out.
- Okay, I got--

20:28.310 --> 20:29.686
Get out of here.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.889
Go.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.197
Is this smart? He could bring
his whole army through with him.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.992
We take that risk, or we get
crushed to death in here.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.575
Tell him to go through the red door

20:54.879 --> 20:57.541
of that root cellar at his house.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.677
Be careful.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.056
The lake's where we came
through from Zenith.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.895
Someone should be there
when he shows up.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.440
Look, it's stopping.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.647
- You're not going anywhere.
- Joe and I'll go.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.110
Fine.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.241
You go get a walkie,
then head on out to the lake.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.277
But actually hide this time, all right?

21:30.456 --> 21:32.993
Stay out of sight. When my dad
shows up, you radio me.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.907
- Go.
- Will do.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.702
Think your dad will really
go get that egg?

21:42.510 --> 21:44.671
The dome will let us know.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.762
Julia.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.013
Hey.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.853
The dome stopped contracting.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.021
- What?
- I met with my dad,

21:58.192 --> 22:00.433
and I convinced him to get
that egg back to us. Literally,

22:00.611 --> 22:02.727
as soon as he left,
the walls just stopped shrinking.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.237
Maybe the dome must have
wanted the egg back too.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.864
When it saw your dad would make
that happen, it gave us a sign.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.617
I can't say for sure, but I don't know
how else to explain it.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.824
Guys? Come here, quick.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.660
Melanie.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.076
- Hi.
- Hey. How are you feeling?

22:18.963 --> 22:20.453
Like myself again.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.123
The transfusion worked.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.882
That, and we're getting
that egg back.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.634
It's why I'm getting better.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.553
I guess when it's okay, you're okay.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.759
REBECCA:
Listen,

22:31.934 --> 22:34.016
the transfusion only
buys us some time.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.596
She's still very sick.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.513
Whatever it is, she's a hell of a lot
better right now than she was.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.103
All right?
That's all that matters to me.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.564
Hello?

22:45.072 --> 22:46.107
Hello?

22:48.117 --> 22:49.778
Can anyone hear me?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.109
All the batteries in
these walkies are dead.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.368
The ones over here are too.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.619
BARBIE [OVER RADIO]:
Yeah, Norrie, [read you.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.291
Great, just checking. We'll radio you

22:59.461 --> 23:01.167
- when your dad gets here.
- Roger that.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.666
All right, we got one.
We're good to go.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.007
We sure are.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.589
- What is that?
- It's a gun.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.924
Yes, I'm aware it's a gun.
What are you doing with it?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.179
We're taking it with us.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.177
No, you're gonna put that down.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.217
Look, relax, I checked.
It's not even loaded.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.602
Yeah, and it's not going to be.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.514
You're gonna put it back,
find the key, and lock it the hell up.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.307
- Norrie--
- Joe, the one and only time

23:23.485 --> 23:25.897
you have ever held a gun,
you almost shot Melanie in the face.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.107
- In other words, I didn't.
- It's not coming.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.694
Barbie thinks his dad could
be dangerous. Hunter does too.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.610
We need it for protection in case
he tries anything when he gets here.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.161
You want protection?
Just get behind me.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.120
Plus, if Don Barbara
does show up with the egg,

23:40.294 --> 23:42.876
it's gonna be because he wants
to help us, not hurt us.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.787
- Let's go.
- All right.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.206
Not gonna end this way.
Not after all we've been through.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.045
Not after the dome
brought you back to me.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.550
I wish I could see

23:50.846 --> 23:53.588
something to paint.
Anything to get us out of here.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.801
What if I can help?

23:55.726 --> 23:57.216
You can't fix me.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.180
It's like I'm drowning.
I'm looking for shore,

23:59.355 --> 24:00.936
and all I see is darkness.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.772
Okay, you can't see,
but can you feel?

24:04.318 --> 24:06.855
Yes. I feel.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.738
I feel alone.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.649
Ashamed.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.234
Of me?

24:15.412 --> 24:17.494
No, of me.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.995
Ashamed for letting Melanie die
all those years ago.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.213
Ashamed for losing faith in you.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.834
Ashamed of leaving my family.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.964
No, you didn't lose faith.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.594
I'm the one who lost faith.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.925
I didn't understand your gifts,

24:36.100 --> 24:38.591
or that the dome had chosen us.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.392
Now I do.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.599
How can you be sure?

24:43.273 --> 24:46.515
Junior was chosen
to bring you back to me.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.853
The dome chose to save me
before I could hang myself.

24:51.699 --> 24:54.065
And it healed all those people,

24:54.284 --> 24:57.071
as soon as it saw what
I was willing to sacrifice.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.406
You were chosen
to lead Chester's Mill.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.205
And you were chosen
