WEBVTT

02:17.947 --> 02:18.948
Whoa.

02:20.983 --> 02:21.984
You okay?

02:23.853 --> 02:25.154
You really-

02:25.188 --> 02:27.824
Your face was like that.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.928
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:37.967 --> 02:39.401
Okay.

02:50.713 --> 02:51.981
I won't hurt your sprint.

03:16.038 --> 03:17.173
I love it.

03:19.909 --> 03:21.110
Yeah, those shoes are dope.

03:21.144 --> 03:22.612
Like we should make an
Instagram page for 'em.

03:22.645 --> 03:23.880
What
should the handle be?

03:23.913 --> 03:25.148
White Girl, White Boots

03:25.181 --> 03:26.515
I'm gonna start one on it.

03:26.548 --> 03:29.685
Yeah, let's just like, you know,
like boots chillin', right?

03:29.719 --> 03:30.987
Okay, boots on the quad.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.420
What did
you use to paint these?

03:32.454 --> 03:33.689
Just like a color.

03:56.712 --> 03:58.014
Killin', right?

03:58.047 --> 03:59.282
Okay, boots on the quad.

03:59.314 --> 04:00.750
Boots on the quad baby.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.417
Oh my
God, those socks are so good.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.586
GIRL WITH RED
SKIRT: Thank you.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.121
You're such a good artist.

04:05.154 --> 04:06.722
Honestly, you're-

04:06.756 --> 04:09.792
- At work, chill 'till two,
come hang before lunch.

04:09.826 --> 04:12.161
Dope, see you in
an hour or so, Anuka?

04:12.195 --> 04:13.796
Yay, heart emoji.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.798
It's brewed
so much that I just like,

04:16.833 --> 04:18.333
I don't know,

04:18.366 --> 04:20.069
I just randomly made them one
night when I was really drunk.

04:20.101 --> 04:22.872
Zero percent chance of me
losing my virginity tonight,

04:22.905 --> 04:24.974
thumbs down emoji,
eggplant emoji.

04:25.007 --> 04:27.442
We made a pact,
it's our last night.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.945
We have to hold each
other accountable.

04:28.978 --> 04:31.714
Just don't forget, you're
the only one who knows.

04:31.747 --> 04:35.251
DWAI, babe, you're
secret is safe with me.

04:35.284 --> 04:36.052
Kissy face emoji.

04:40.323 --> 04:43.125
Mark, 22, this could be us.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.028
Jason, 24, TTF only.

04:46.062 --> 04:51.067
Alexander, 27,
I'm a real catch.

04:51.466 --> 04:52.101
Albert.

04:53.202 --> 04:53.970
Georgie.

04:54.971 --> 04:57.106
22, I'm cooking pasta

04:57.139 --> 04:59.675
and we can watch a movie
with my cat, Snickers.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.949
- Hey.
- Shit, sorry.

05:06.983 --> 05:08.150
I must have scared you.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.620
No, I, just didn't see you.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.121
Sorry about that.

05:12.154 --> 05:15.157
So are you ready
for the astro test?

05:15.191 --> 05:16.192
Uh.

05:17.293 --> 05:19.461
- I'm really not sure either.
- Yeah.

05:19.494 --> 05:20.663
I'm kind of nervous though.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.164
Yeah, I'm getting
tense as well.

05:22.198 --> 05:26.636
But you know, that's my
demeanor, is always tense.

05:26.669 --> 05:28.104
I don't really
know how to react.

05:28.137 --> 05:30.606
I totally get it though, it's
like crazy freshman year.

05:30.640 --> 05:34.343
Like, I stay up so
late sometime and,

05:34.377 --> 05:35.443
there are regrets.

05:36.946 --> 05:38.948
I feel like I barely got to
like open up actually to anyone.

05:38.981 --> 05:40.883
Like see the real me.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.385
That's a totally
different story.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.020
Anyway, have you heard about
that party happening tonight?

05:44.053 --> 05:45.054
- Yeah.
- Hi!

05:46.822 --> 05:49.091
- Wait for me?
- I wanna take a shower.

05:49.125 --> 05:50.092
No, just one minute.

05:50.126 --> 05:51.661
- Okay, cool, see ya.
- Bye.

05:51.694 --> 05:52.795
Who's that?

05:52.828 --> 05:54.096
I don't know, he's
in my astro class.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.932
Look who it is.

05:55.965 --> 05:59.335
Izz, getting down to
biz, all sweaty and shiz.

06:01.938 --> 06:04.106
Deb, this is my friend, Izz.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.309
- Hi Izz, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:06.342 --> 06:08.277
You doing anything
interesting this summer?

06:08.311 --> 06:10.079
I'm gonna spend the
summer with my grandparents

06:10.112 --> 06:11.446
outside Chicago.

06:11.479 --> 06:14.684
I'm trying to pass my
drivers' test finally.

06:14.717 --> 06:16.252
You know what they say?

06:16.285 --> 06:18.187
Every time you get in a car,
you put your seatbelt on

06:18.220 --> 06:20.589
and every time you have sex,

06:20.623 --> 06:22.925
- you use a condom.
- Really, mom?

06:22.959 --> 06:24.026
Like right now?

06:24.060 --> 06:27.029
- She's a sex educator.
- Thanks.

06:27.063 --> 06:29.231
Well, time to get this
road on the show JuJu.

06:33.336 --> 06:35.204
Bye.

06:35.237 --> 06:37.539
Drive
safe my Indian princess.

06:38.506 --> 06:40.142
He's still saying that?

06:52.855 --> 06:55.291
Izzy, look at these notes.

06:55.324 --> 06:58.560
You're totally ready
for your final.

06:58.594 --> 07:00.096
It was so easy
for me in high school

07:00.129 --> 07:02.131
but this class is killing me.

07:02.164 --> 07:04.499
Can we just
have fun tonight?

07:04.532 --> 07:06.869
I'll have fun
when I get to Chicago.

07:10.538 --> 07:12.641
Izzy.

07:15.211 --> 07:16.145
You look fine.

07:17.246 --> 07:19.648
It's just a black t-shirt.

07:25.788 --> 07:27.490
Excuse me, these
shoes smell like piss.

07:27.522 --> 07:29.291
Um, that's how
they all smell, so.

07:31.727 --> 07:33.729
I'm not putting
those on my feet.

07:33.763 --> 07:35.898
Yeah okay, well then
you can't bowl, so.

07:39.235 --> 07:40.870
Can you just not do that?

07:40.903 --> 07:43.339
We have a very particular way
about cleaning about them, so,

07:43.372 --> 07:44.707
that's my job.

07:44.740 --> 07:46.075
Well it seems like a bad way.

07:46.108 --> 07:47.643
Because it still
smells like puke.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.211
Cool.

07:49.245 --> 07:51.881
Yeah, if you don't put
these on, you can't bowl.

07:53.049 --> 07:57.086
Okay, you can't
bowl in your socks.

07:57.119 --> 07:59.522
Why do all the pretty girls
also have to be talented?

08:03.993 --> 08:05.828
So much more fair
if they all sucked.

08:05.861 --> 08:09.098
Okay, you're acting like
you're not pretty and talented.

08:09.131 --> 08:10.332
I mean like your hair's doing

08:10.366 --> 08:11.700
like a funny little
thing today but.

08:11.734 --> 08:13.202
Have you seen her Instagram?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.621
Lisa's so hot.

08:32.655 --> 08:34.256
Nolan is so hot.

08:35.924 --> 08:37.525
They're both pretentious.

08:48.037 --> 08:51.273
Come see my lovely art
at #crushparty tonight.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.111
What's a crush party?

08:57.480 --> 08:58.781
I don't know.

09:03.819 --> 09:05.054
Be right back.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.059
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.360
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:11.393 --> 09:14.029
Why is everyone so
obsessed with her?

09:14.864 --> 09:16.899
Her art isn't even good.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.434
I like her art.

09:18.467 --> 09:19.201
It's cute.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.806
I don't want my
art to be cute.

09:23.839 --> 09:25.774
Yeah, your art isn't cute.

09:25.808 --> 09:28.277
I was just looking
at your Instagram.

09:28.310 --> 09:29.845
Hmm hmm.

09:29.879 --> 09:33.482
And I was just wondering
what a crush party is.

09:33.516 --> 09:37.253
Oh, a crush party
is, are you a freshman?

09:37.286 --> 09:38.187
Hmm hmm.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.889
I mean look at her shoes.

09:39.922 --> 09:42.024
She had to paint these as well?

09:43.092 --> 09:43.993
I don't get it.

10:01.377 --> 10:02.511
No one's
even gonna be there,

10:02.545 --> 10:04.246
everyone's left for the summer.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.148
Yeah, that's why
everyone's gonan be there

10:06.182 --> 10:07.082
specially to bone.

10:07.116 --> 10:09.118
Isn't that like every party?

10:09.151 --> 10:10.452
Also, who says bone?

10:10.486 --> 10:12.454
Uh, I say bone, boning is hot.

10:12.488 --> 10:15.291
It sounds like ET, bone
home or throw a dog a bone.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.459
No, it's like
come on bone me baby

10:17.493 --> 10:19.195
or like come on, just
a quick little bone

10:19.228 --> 10:20.296
before this party tonight.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.897
It sounds awful.

10:21.931 --> 10:23.265
Hey, you're
like a monk with a vagina.

10:23.299 --> 10:24.466
That's a nun.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.669
I haven't even
started studying.

10:25.701 --> 10:27.369
We made a pact.

10:27.403 --> 10:29.405
Fiona, if I do
not pass this test,

10:29.438 --> 10:32.007
I'm literally dead and
will lose my scholarship.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.776
- Wait, what pack?
- Okay.

10:33.809 --> 10:36.111
You're gonna be stuck with
your grandparents all summer.

10:36.145 --> 10:39.448
Um, eating oatmeal and
playing like badminton

10:39.481 --> 10:41.850
and massaging their dog when
she's constipated, okay.

10:41.884 --> 10:44.654
You need to be freaking DM on
getting some dick right now.

10:44.688 --> 10:48.390
Oh she'll do the guy
she did last summer.

10:48.424 --> 10:49.191
What's his name?

10:49.225 --> 10:50.426
Travis.

10:50.459 --> 10:52.596
Oh Travis,
who is Travis.

10:52.629 --> 10:53.862
Never mind.

10:53.896 --> 10:56.633
- If I submit my crush's name.
- Hmm hmm.

10:56.666 --> 10:58.567
They get a
specific invitation.

10:58.602 --> 10:59.535
Yes.

10:59.568 --> 11:01.570
And if someone crushes me,

11:01.605 --> 11:03.505
I also get an invite.

11:04.340 --> 11:05.374
Crush party.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.612
There
was a dog trapped

11:08.645 --> 11:10.079
inside a sewage plant.

11:10.112 --> 11:11.747
It's unclear how
he ended up there.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.549
But everything turned out okay.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.850
He's back home safe
with his owners

11:14.883 --> 11:16.485
eating a big bowl of kibble.

11:16.518 --> 11:18.220
Thank
you Jeff, in other news,

11:18.254 --> 11:19.521
Huntington Center is hosting

11:19.555 --> 11:21.691
the Midwest succulent
convention today.

11:21.725 --> 11:22.758
Hi.

11:22.791 --> 11:24.126
Admission is free

11:24.159 --> 11:25.194
for children under 12...

12:10.072 --> 12:12.041
You need to friend
him on Facebook

12:12.074 --> 12:14.343
and then deep like
one of his photos.

12:14.376 --> 12:15.645
Deep what?

12:15.679 --> 12:17.580
It's like, you go way
back into their photos

12:17.614 --> 12:19.181
and then like one.

12:19.214 --> 12:21.751
So that it sends them a signal
that you're stalking them

12:21.785 --> 12:23.452
and that you're
interested in them.

12:26.322 --> 12:28.223
I couldn't find
the one on Facebook.

12:28.257 --> 12:30.125
I'll try to find
tagged photos of him.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.397
My profile reads apathetic
with a touch of fuck boy.

12:35.431 --> 12:37.433
It's clear that I took
time to curate my page

12:37.466 --> 12:39.835
but not that much time.

12:39.868 --> 12:42.538
I love internet art
and I have a tattoo

12:42.571 --> 12:44.641
of my childhood stuffed
animal on my bicep

12:44.674 --> 12:46.508
so I have no pictures
of no one here.

12:50.112 --> 12:53.449
I sort of forget to
update my profile picture.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.084
It's been the same
for like two years

12:55.117 --> 12:58.554
and I'm fairly hot but I don't
really like to show it off.

12:58.588 --> 13:00.522
But no picture
with Nolan, sorry.

13:03.192 --> 13:04.594
What about that guy?

13:04.627 --> 13:07.529
I haven't changed my
profile picture since 2007.

13:07.563 --> 13:09.898
I only use Facebook to
follow banned pictures.

13:09.932 --> 13:12.669
I don't have Facebook so
technically I don't exist.

13:12.702 --> 13:13.636
No, whatever.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.537
And I think he's dating Elise.

13:15.571 --> 13:19.576
Elise is gay, like
gay gay, not bi.

13:19.609 --> 13:21.343
Because in one of our class,

13:21.377 --> 13:23.545
she brought in all
these paintings

13:23.580 --> 13:26.850
of all the vaginas
of all her exes

13:26.882 --> 13:30.519
and then she talked about
all the breakups like

13:30.552 --> 13:31.788
every story, so.

13:33.489 --> 13:34.289
She's gay.

13:36.693 --> 13:38.327
What about that guy?

13:40.429 --> 13:41.430
No.

13:42.464 --> 13:43.700
I'mma gonna get some cereal.

13:45.067 --> 13:45.934
Okay.

13:58.615 --> 14:00.082
Elise, 22.

14:00.115 --> 14:02.985
Let's get naked and paint
each other's bodies.

14:03.018 --> 14:05.354
Hey Elise.

14:08.090 --> 14:11.026
Yo, what's up girlfriend, no.

14:13.962 --> 14:16.031
Question about the
crushed party, eh.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.548
It's at Big Blue.

14:32.582 --> 14:34.082
Just go there and
ask for Stephanie.

14:34.116 --> 14:39.054
She's like tall and stunning
and really hip and friendly.

14:39.722 --> 14:41.256
Just tell her you wanna
submit in a crush.

14:41.290 --> 14:42.558
- Cool.
- Definitely go.

14:42.592 --> 14:44.861
- It'll be so fun.
- Okay.

14:44.894 --> 14:46.495
See ya there.

14:46.528 --> 14:49.666
We're both getting action,
we're both getting action.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.034
Shh, shh.

14:53.368 --> 14:55.204
You're always so loud.

14:55.237 --> 14:56.673
I prefer enthusiastic.

14:56.706 --> 14:58.340
Isabel.

14:59.809 --> 15:02.745
We made a pinky promise,
a pact, you and I.

15:02.779 --> 15:04.781
I'm going to make
out with Elise.

15:04.814 --> 15:07.951
You are going to find
someone and bone them

15:07.983 --> 15:10.552
and pop that sweet, sweet,
cute little cherry of yours.

15:10.587 --> 15:11.788
Shh.

15:11.821 --> 15:14.591
You just have to um,
channel your secret,

15:14.624 --> 15:17.594
inner female goddess
and have eye sex

15:17.627 --> 15:19.729
with everyone on
the dance floor.

15:19.762 --> 15:21.196
Super simple.

15:21.230 --> 15:22.998
Eye sex, hmm hmm.

15:23.031 --> 15:24.399
You just find
someone in this party

15:24.433 --> 15:26.803
and then you lock
eye, like this.

15:39.883 --> 15:42.084
Yeah, okay, try
it, try it with me.

15:52.629 --> 15:55.230
Okay, hmm, hold eye contact.

15:55.264 --> 15:57.767
Okay, a little less diarrhea.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.903
Okay, okay, let's stop.

15:59.936 --> 16:03.038
Um, we're just gonna get
your very drunk, okay?

16:05.842 --> 16:10.613
I'm Sexy Rexy, AKA Mean
Profit, AKA Young Jump Start.

16:10.647 --> 16:12.849
I love bowls of spaghetti,
my pod collection,

16:12.882 --> 16:15.618
Naruto fan fiction and dad bods.

16:15.652 --> 16:18.120
I could be your
devil or your angle.

16:18.153 --> 16:19.789
Hope I made you turtle.

16:33.569 --> 16:35.872
You really want that cereal?

16:35.905 --> 16:38.574
It sticks together
when it's stale so.

16:38.608 --> 16:40.643
You can just take
some from the top.

16:40.677 --> 16:43.046
But punching it
might be more fun.

16:43.913 --> 16:46.616
Genius, thank you.

16:54.556 --> 16:55.959
No problem.

16:55.992 --> 16:59.361
I'm always like struggling
to get it open like...

17:03.733 --> 17:05.034
I'll give
them back tomorrow.

17:05.068 --> 17:07.036
Izzy, you...

17:07.069 --> 17:08.704
Do you have an
early flight tomorrow?

17:08.738 --> 17:10.472
- Hmm hmm.
- Hmm hmm, so.

17:10.505 --> 17:12.140
- Early morning.
- Right, yeah.

17:12.174 --> 17:13.175
We probably shouldn't
go out then.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.443
See, you gotta
stop doing that.

17:14.476 --> 17:15.678
You don't want to
be hung over tomorrow.

17:15.712 --> 17:16.746
- You are...
- Can we call it?

17:16.779 --> 17:17.880
I have to go back to work.

17:17.914 --> 17:19.848
Someone took shoes,
I don't know.

17:19.882 --> 17:22.483
That means you have to
go to Big Blue, okay.

17:22.517 --> 17:24.219
You need to submit Nolan.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.555
I'm gonna submit Elise, okay.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.390
It's two blocks down
the road, just go.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.592
There should be a box.

17:29.626 --> 17:31.126
Find the box, if
there's not a box, knock

17:31.159 --> 17:33.029
and ask for Stephanie.

17:33.062 --> 17:34.897
Apparently, she's really hot.

17:36.131 --> 17:37.634
Izzy, I know
where we're going.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.201
It's that way.

17:39.234 --> 17:41.838
- It's that's way!
- Eh, no.

17:44.306 --> 17:45.407
Where are we?

17:46.208 --> 17:47.577
I think this way.

17:52.815 --> 17:54.483
That way.

17:57.787 --> 17:58.788
Are you sure?

17:59.656 --> 18:00.923
This has to be it.

18:03.392 --> 18:04.861
Oh my God, it smells like weed.

18:29.251 --> 18:31.420
Yo, what's up ladies?

18:31.453 --> 18:33.555
Or should I say girls?

18:33.589 --> 18:34.624
Or should I say women?

18:34.657 --> 18:35.892
Is Stephanie here?

18:35.925 --> 18:38.761
Stephanie is ocucpano,
if you know what I mean.

18:38.795 --> 18:41.831
We're here to submit our
crushes for the party tonight.

18:41.864 --> 18:43.166
Party?

18:43.198 --> 18:45.835
The crush party, it's
happening here tonight?

18:45.868 --> 18:47.670
We sell great parties.

18:47.704 --> 18:49.571
You ladies wanna smoke?

18:49.605 --> 18:51.841
No, we're here to
submit our crush's name

18:51.874 --> 18:54.476
in a box to make sure that
they're invited to the party

18:54.509 --> 18:57.146
and to let them know that
someone else in the party

18:57.180 --> 18:59.281
is interested in
them romantically.

18:59.314 --> 19:00.583
What about Tinder?

19:02.952 --> 19:03.986
K, K?

19:07.824 --> 19:09.458
I matched with him on Tinder.

19:09.491 --> 19:10.292
What?

19:12.762 --> 19:15.865
I couldn't find a pen but if
you write down your crushes,

19:15.898 --> 19:17.600
I'll make sure they
get to Stephanie.

19:17.633 --> 19:18.433
In that?

19:48.831 --> 19:51.399
Anuka, are
you submitting someone?

19:51.433 --> 19:53.002
Yeah, just for fun.

19:56.139 --> 19:59.374
Do not tell me this is
my Phineas and Ferb DVD.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.676
It is.

20:00.710 --> 20:02.011
For six months, I've
been looking for this.

20:02.044 --> 20:04.080
Please put it somewhere safe.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.882
And then Fifi, hand me the tens.

20:06.983 --> 20:08.751
We gotta do a count on that too.

20:08.785 --> 20:09.919
Thank you.

20:09.952 --> 20:12.521
Oh boy, that is heavy, God!

20:14.757 --> 20:15.892
Hand me the fourteens.

20:17.526 --> 20:19.862
- You kids lack mortals.
- Hmm hmm.

20:19.896 --> 20:24.200
You have
no scruples, at all.

20:24.233 --> 20:25.333
Hmm hmm.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.003
Bowlers, we gotta keep our
minds out of the gutters.

20:27.036 --> 20:28.470
The red tape doesn't
belong in here.

20:28.503 --> 20:29.404
Where's the, where's the...

20:29.437 --> 20:31.140
- I...
- Oh here.

20:31.174 --> 20:31.974
Take that.

20:33.109 --> 20:33.910
And take these.

20:34.977 --> 20:36.078
We gotta kid coming in.

20:36.112 --> 20:37.512
Competitive, he's good.

20:38.948 --> 20:40.082
Are we really gonna
close College Lanes

20:40.116 --> 20:41.784
because of a stolen
pair of shoes?

21:03.172 --> 21:04.207
We can't close
College Lanes, okay.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.708
I hated being a barista.

21:05.741 --> 21:06.676
I hated it Tony.

21:06.709 --> 21:07.977
I hated it.

21:08.010 --> 21:09.846
See, where's
that passion been?

21:09.879 --> 21:11.914
You're over here,
a kid tipping balls

21:11.948 --> 21:13.950
and then you're hopping
on the oil pushers.

21:13.983 --> 21:14.851
What?

21:14.884 --> 21:16.152
The thing that
cleans the lanes.

21:16.185 --> 21:17.452
Oh.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.888
I know it's fun, it's like
a Zamboni, but seriously.

21:18.921 --> 21:20.422
Look at that.

21:20.455 --> 21:22.859
My grandma painted that by hand.

21:22.892 --> 21:24.426
- We said, grandma, why?
- Why?

21:24.459 --> 21:26.494
Why by hand, we'll do it,
we'll get decals, whatever.

21:26.528 --> 21:27.830
She said, un uh,
I'm gonna do it.

21:27.864 --> 21:29.198
We said, it doesn't match.

21:29.232 --> 21:30.532
Brown and yellow,
it doesn't match.

21:30.565 --> 21:31.466
No.

21:31.499 --> 21:32.702
Said, I wanna do it in neon.

21:32.735 --> 21:34.237
That's become the fabric
of this whole place,

21:34.270 --> 21:35.037
you see what I'm saying?

21:35.071 --> 21:36.538
I do.

21:36.571 --> 21:39.175
It's all cobbled together
with people like us,

21:39.208 --> 21:43.145
but these, the shoes,
they keep it going.

21:44.379 --> 21:45.948
- Repeat after me.
- Okay.

21:45.982 --> 21:46.949
- We.
- We.

21:46.983 --> 21:47.917
- Won't.
- Won't.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.252
- Lose.
- Lose.

21:49.285 --> 21:51.220
- Slow down.
- Sorry.

21:51.254 --> 21:53.122
- Any more.
- Any more.

21:53.155 --> 21:55.091
- Shoes.
- Shoes, I will find them.

21:55.124 --> 21:56.424
- Go find the shoes.
- Okay.

22:01.197 --> 22:05.001
Uh hey, are you gonan be
studying all night, tonight?

22:05.034 --> 22:07.303
She's on no astro diet.

22:07.336 --> 22:08.371
No more studying.

22:08.403 --> 22:11.107
Not totally no more studying.

22:11.140 --> 22:14.944
So are you gonna be going to
any parties, tonight, maybe?

22:14.977 --> 22:16.979
The crush party.

22:17.013 --> 22:18.814
- At Big Blue.
- Cool.

22:18.848 --> 22:20.716
Cool, yeah, me too, actually.

22:20.750 --> 22:21.684
Cool.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.152
I don't usually go to parties.

22:23.185 --> 22:25.288
I usually stay in with
Paul and we watch videos.

22:25.321 --> 22:26.289
Yeah, I...

22:26.322 --> 22:27.690
Yeah, just these sort
of like sort of Russian

22:27.723 --> 22:29.625
motorcycle accident videos.

22:29.659 --> 22:31.193
There's like no road laws there.

22:33.329 --> 22:34.330
Phew!

22:37.199 --> 22:39.201
Yeah, they're actually
pretty exhilarating.

22:48.443 --> 22:49.245
Cool.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.214
I'll see you there, then.

22:52.248 --> 22:54.016
Yeah, no, I'll
probably see you later.

22:54.050 --> 22:55.818
You don't wanna
get with this guy!

22:55.851 --> 22:57.186
He's gross!

22:58.220 --> 22:58.988
Stop.

22:59.021 --> 23:00.122
Dude, gross is in.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.226
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.163
That boy is totally into you.

23:07.196 --> 23:08.563
You should flirt with him.

23:08.597 --> 23:10.498
He's awkward.

23:10.532 --> 23:13.336
And his friend literally
just said he's gross.

23:13.369 --> 23:15.705
They're just messing with you.

23:15.738 --> 23:17.173
Here.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.681
They took my gin.

23:25.715 --> 23:27.249
I didn't know they were
allowed to open the cabinets

23:27.283 --> 23:28.851
or anything.

23:28.884 --> 23:31.187
Would you have sex with
all these old people,

23:31.220 --> 23:32.088
staring at you?

23:33.189 --> 23:34.390
They're not old people.

23:34.423 --> 23:37.727
Do you even know who
Vera Cooper Rubin is?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.662
Literally, no one cares.

23:39.695 --> 23:41.330
She
discovered dark matter.

23:41.364 --> 23:44.467
How many people do you think
had sex on your mattress?

23:44.499 --> 23:47.636
I can't do to this party
sober and we have five hours

23:47.670 --> 23:49.138
to get alcohol and get drunk

23:49.171 --> 23:51.440
and my mom thinks
I'm 12 years old

23:51.474 --> 23:55.578
and sent me a single lollipop
in a box covered in hearts.

23:59.248 --> 24:01.050
You're freaking kidding me.

24:11.427 --> 24:14.363
Fiona, they took my
gin in room inspections.

24:14.397 --> 24:16.232
We're gonna go get
beer or something

24:16.265 --> 24:18.533
at the gas station, ugh.

24:18.566 --> 24:19.567
Crying emoji.

24:20.503 --> 24:22.138
Dude, that's so much alcohol.

24:22.171 --> 24:23.472
Dude, shh, come on.

24:30.446 --> 24:31.647
Hi boys.

24:36.085 --> 24:37.119
Hi.

24:37.153 --> 24:39.688
You don't have
alcohol, do you?

24:47.263 --> 24:48.397
Will Lee?

24:50.565 --> 24:51.867
Yeah, Willy.

24:51.901 --> 24:53.402
It says this time
that you're from uh,

24:53.436 --> 24:55.104
Dicksville, Arkansas.

24:55.137 --> 24:56.739
Yeah, yeah, Dicksville, yeah.

24:56.772 --> 24:58.541
Well, you have a good
time in Dicksville, okay.

24:58.573 --> 24:59.975
- Yeah, man.
- Not bad though.

25:00.009 --> 25:01.343
- Respect, my dude.
- Yeah.

25:01.377 --> 25:02.344
$8.50.

25:03.446 --> 25:04.346
Take care, yeah.

25:05.648 --> 25:06.849
Next.

25:06.882 --> 25:08.918
- Just the ramens for ya?
- Yeah, just the ramen.

25:09.452 --> 25:11.187
Are you sure you don't want

25:11.220 --> 25:12.988
a smell my nuts flavored candle?

25:16.058 --> 25:17.093
No.

25:17.126 --> 25:18.127
Where you from?

25:18.160 --> 25:19.762
- India.
- India, okay.

25:19.795 --> 25:21.130
Is it hot in India?

25:21.163 --> 25:22.798
'Cause I like it hot.

25:22.832 --> 25:23.632
Yeah.

25:23.666 --> 25:24.500
What about you, young lady?

25:24.533 --> 25:25.901
This is all?

25:25.935 --> 25:26.735
You have an ID?

25:49.258 --> 25:52.895
So how is the weather
in um, in Apalachocola?

25:53.896 --> 25:55.798
Nice, warmish.

25:55.831 --> 25:57.933
Warmish?

25:57.967 --> 25:58.767
Okay.

26:01.170 --> 26:03.005
I don't think so my lady.

26:03.038 --> 26:04.340
But I could give
you one of those

26:04.373 --> 26:06.375
smell my nuts flavored candles.

26:08.277 --> 26:10.212
That was ridiculous.

26:10.246 --> 26:13.182
You're lucky that he
gave you your ID back.

26:13.215 --> 26:15.384
Fiona isn't even answering.

26:16.185 --> 26:17.386
Dear Isabelle,

26:17.419 --> 26:19.655
I will be in my office
until nine this evening.

26:19.688 --> 26:23.325
Please come by with questions
and to review the materials.

26:23.359 --> 26:27.429
You need at least 71% on
this test to pass the class.

26:27.463 --> 26:29.965
I don't wanna see you fail.

26:29.999 --> 26:32.468
And I highly suggest that
you come by to see me.

26:33.536 --> 26:36.238
I have some of Julius' weed.

26:36.272 --> 26:40.342
You know weed gives me
horrible panic attacks.

26:42.411 --> 26:44.246
I should just go
see my professor.

26:50.286 --> 26:51.420
Oh my God.

26:51.453 --> 26:53.255
Congratulations, hot stuff.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.292
You've been crushed.

26:56.325 --> 26:58.027
Somebody crushed me.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.328
Who do you think crushed me?

26:59.361 --> 27:01.330
Tonight you get
to chase your crush.

27:01.363 --> 27:04.668
Wear pink and red and show
up at Big Blue by 11:00 p.m.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.001
to get a heart.

27:06.035 --> 27:08.437
Only people who've been
crushed are allowed in.

27:08.470 --> 27:10.272
See you then sexy.

27:10.306 --> 27:12.975
Winky face, smiley, Stephanie.

27:13.909 --> 27:15.144
That guy is
peeing on that car.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.780
You are a sex goddess.

27:17.813 --> 27:19.248
Come to the party tonight.

27:19.281 --> 27:20.416
You won't regret it.

27:20.449 --> 27:21.884
Don't you wanna succeed?

27:21.917 --> 27:23.986
You don't wanna end your
freshman year still a virgin,

27:24.019 --> 27:24.920
do you?

27:24.954 --> 27:27.223
This is your future Isabelle.

27:32.094 --> 27:35.231
Ah, this is some
legit kinky stuff.

27:36.131 --> 27:37.399
Oh my God.

27:37.433 --> 27:39.335
You should
not put those on.

27:39.368 --> 27:43.405
Oh my God, just feeling
them makes you so nice.

27:43.439 --> 27:46.242
It's like very sexual Jared.

27:46.275 --> 27:48.678
Kind of like it too much.

27:48.712 --> 27:50.714
Like very into this.

27:50.746 --> 27:52.114
Ah.

27:52.147 --> 27:53.482
Fiona, answer your phone.

27:53.515 --> 27:55.150
I just got crushed.

27:59.355 --> 28:02.458
Dispatch, put me on with
George George Victor, 1133.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.880
I let you borrow mom's
car and this is what you do?

28:24.913 --> 28:26.048
I thougth you were
gonna take pop pop

28:26.081 --> 28:27.383
to the Midwest
succulent convention.

28:27.416 --> 28:28.851
I'm really sorry
officer, you know,

28:28.884 --> 28:31.387
I just thought these were
like kinky handcuffs,

28:31.420 --> 28:33.956
like for sex not for jail.

28:33.989 --> 28:34.758
And I...

28:35.991 --> 28:36.792
Sorry.

28:37.893 --> 28:39.696
Okay.

28:40.697 --> 28:41.698
Thank you.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.636
J, when you're
behind the wheel,

28:46.670 --> 28:48.638
you need to be aware of
everything around you.

28:48.672 --> 28:50.105
We're all fishes.

28:50.139 --> 28:51.641
You need to watch out for
all of them around you.

28:51.675 --> 28:52.908
Dad!

28:52.941 --> 28:54.209
No, you're gonna
let me finish.

28:54.243 --> 28:56.512
Don't move, I'll
be right there.

28:59.248 --> 29:03.352
Hello, I found alcohol
ladies, let's go shall we?

29:03.385 --> 29:05.287
Fiona, who
are these children

29:05.321 --> 29:06.822
and where are they taking us?

29:06.855 --> 29:08.190
Izzy, don't worry about it.

29:08.223 --> 29:10.392
If we die
tonight, it's on you.

29:20.135 --> 29:21.437
All right, just
a little bit further.

29:21.470 --> 29:22.639
Where are we going?

29:26.875 --> 29:27.677
Oh wow.

29:28.745 --> 29:29.511
Yeah.

29:31.614 --> 29:33.616
I hated
high school, you know.

29:33.650 --> 29:34.983
Everyone thought I
was a middle schooler,

29:35.017 --> 29:36.720
'cause I had my braces on still.

29:36.753 --> 29:38.454
It's a hard time.

29:38.487 --> 29:39.922
Well, don't worry...

29:39.955 --> 29:42.524
In the beginning, about
13 billion years ago,

29:42.558 --> 29:45.729
all the space, matter and
energy of the known universe

29:45.762 --> 29:48.665
was contained in the volume
of a single pinpoint.

29:48.698 --> 29:50.399
The diversity of life on Earth.

29:54.804 --> 29:56.773
Don't you want to succeed.

29:56.806 --> 29:59.375
Lose your virginity
another time.

29:59.408 --> 30:01.910
This is your future, Isabelle.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.481
Izzy, you'll do fine.

30:06.683 --> 30:08.651
I should have gone
to see my professor.

30:08.685 --> 30:11.553
Well, maybe you're
not the next Carl Sagan.

30:11.588 --> 30:12.955
- Sagan.
- Sagan.

30:15.090 --> 30:16.659
You're Izzy Alden.

30:16.693 --> 30:18.795
You're smart, committed.

30:18.828 --> 30:20.129
And you'll do fine,

30:20.162 --> 30:23.432
even if you study all
night tonight or not.

30:23.465 --> 30:25.635
Let's play, never have I ever.

30:25.668 --> 30:27.569
If you've done it, you drink.

30:27.604 --> 30:30.874
Never have I ever
been in a threesome.

30:31.841 --> 30:32.609
Oh.

30:33.743 --> 30:35.612
Bullshit, Emerson.

30:35.645 --> 30:37.045
You don't know my life Jared.

30:38.848 --> 30:40.983
Two boys or two girls?

30:42.050 --> 30:44.286
- Both.
- Oh.

30:45.521 --> 30:46.723
Even
though you don't see it

30:46.756 --> 30:48.825
or feel it, touch
it or taste it,

30:48.858 --> 30:50.627
smell it or even sense it,

30:50.660 --> 30:53.262
does not mean it does not exist.

30:53.295 --> 30:56.465
Part of why we have
science at all is to decode

30:56.498 --> 30:59.736
that which is true in nature
that otherwise transcends

30:59.769 --> 31:01.103
our sensory perceptions.

31:03.439 --> 31:04.774
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

31:09.311 --> 31:10.279
Yes.

31:12.715 --> 31:14.049
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

31:14.082 --> 31:15.852
- Oh Izzy.
- I'll be your driver.

31:15.885 --> 31:18.855
Izzy, you're
a terrible driver.

31:18.888 --> 31:19.823
You don't
have a license.

31:19.856 --> 31:21.691
You're all too drunk.

31:21.724 --> 31:25.527
You
will not be a statistic.

31:26.830 --> 31:28.832
What you doing?

31:28.865 --> 31:33.302
She's grounding herself.

31:33.335 --> 31:37.473
Just feel the wheel on your
sexy little fingertips, okay.

31:37.506 --> 31:39.475
You're ready for takeoff.

31:39.508 --> 31:42.077
You're like a sexy
car astronaut.

31:46.850 --> 31:48.083
Come Izzy, floor it.

31:48.116 --> 31:50.118
We gotta get you on
the way to boneville.

31:50.152 --> 31:51.821
Bone, bone, boneville!

31:51.855 --> 31:53.823
- Boneville, bone...
- Would you stop?

31:56.024 --> 31:57.559
Um, just
go a little faster.

32:01.029 --> 32:05.334
Okay, so we get back, get
changed and go to Big Blue.

32:05.367 --> 32:07.937
Just focus on the road Izzy.

32:07.971 --> 32:09.606
Can you tell me who it's from?

32:11.808 --> 32:13.676
Your mom just texted.

32:13.710 --> 32:17.546
She said, Izz, did
you get my package?

32:17.580 --> 32:19.949
Just a little end of
the year celebration.

32:23.051 --> 32:25.622
She sent a photo
of herself with,

32:26.756 --> 32:27.991
a joint?

32:28.023 --> 32:29.525
Okay, your mom is hot.

32:29.558 --> 32:30.559
Is that all she said?

32:30.593 --> 32:32.862
My dad got a thing for her.

32:32.896 --> 32:34.129
Who?

32:34.931 --> 32:36.365
Shit.

32:36.398 --> 32:38.133
Oh, it's my dad again.

32:42.404 --> 32:43.372
Who's that?

32:46.676 --> 32:48.611
Oh my God,
no, no, no, no, no.

32:53.016 --> 32:56.719
J, what in the hell is
she doing driving mom's car?

32:56.753 --> 32:58.621
You lose soda pop
privileges for two weeks.

32:58.655 --> 33:01.223
That's not fair, dad you
can't even pull people over.

33:01.256 --> 33:02.759
You see this badge Jared?

33:02.792 --> 33:03.993
If you're being a safety threat,

33:04.027 --> 33:06.729
which this young lady,
going 15 in a 35,

33:06.763 --> 33:07.630
I most certainly can.

33:07.664 --> 33:08.631
Sorry officer.

33:08.665 --> 33:09.933
Can I see some ID please?

33:09.966 --> 33:11.433
You're not a cop.

33:28.818 --> 33:30.118
Apalachocola?

33:32.822 --> 33:33.690
We've got cousins there.

33:33.723 --> 33:35.992
Ah, yeah.

33:37.594 --> 33:38.828
Nice weather.

33:38.861 --> 33:40.462
I gotta make it
down there sometime.

33:40.495 --> 33:41.764
J, put gas in the car.

34:00.583 --> 34:02.250
Ah, I just
feel so good right now.

34:02.284 --> 34:04.353
So that
was my gin they were drinking.

34:04.386 --> 34:05.788
I gotta shower.

34:07.624 --> 34:08.858
Okay, I'm gonna go change

34:08.891 --> 34:10.827
and I'll meet you
in the playground.

34:13.062 --> 34:15.397
They faked the
room inspections.

34:16.866 --> 34:20.870
All that alcohol you were
drinking, was stolen.

34:20.902 --> 34:24.641
Um, and Elise's boots?

34:26.241 --> 34:28.077
I'll give them back.

34:28.110 --> 34:28.911
Ah huh.

34:36.585 --> 34:38.253
Nolan Wiles, hmm.

34:39.554 --> 34:41.156
I have a lot of
pictures of me smiling.

34:41.188 --> 34:43.059
But taken with
cool film cameras.

34:43.092 --> 34:46.495
It's a good combination
of hip, but approachable.

34:46.527 --> 34:47.797
I have a big trust fund

34:47.830 --> 34:50.165
but my most expensive
item of clothing?

34:50.197 --> 34:51.634
$30.

34:51.668 --> 34:53.936
I also do a lot of
promotion for my band page.

34:54.804 --> 34:56.271
I just added him for you.

34:57.339 --> 34:59.776
You love pretentious boys.

34:59.809 --> 35:01.309
Does my make up look okay?

35:02.578 --> 35:04.814
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

35:04.847 --> 35:08.017
You deep like when
he accepts, okay?

35:09.384 --> 35:10.419
Oh my God.

35:10.452 --> 35:12.387
His band is called Cut Loose.

35:57.133 --> 36:00.903
But, you know I'm not like
into big jewelry and stuff.

36:02.004 --> 36:03.005
Just wear them.

36:03.039 --> 36:04.807
They're for good luck.

36:04.841 --> 36:08.177
They were a part of my
great grandmother's dowry.

36:08.211 --> 36:09.645
And you know the rubies,

36:09.679 --> 36:11.114
they came from the red cells

36:11.147 --> 36:12.982
of her mother's father's.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.987
It's like my great
grandparents soul

36:18.020 --> 36:19.756
is preserved in these,

36:19.789 --> 36:22.524
soon to be followed
by my grandparents

36:22.557 --> 36:24.961
and my parents and then me.

36:24.994 --> 36:26.394
Is that an Indian tradition,

36:26.428 --> 36:28.998
trapping your
ancestor's in jewelry?

36:29.932 --> 36:31.768
Just wear them.

36:31.801 --> 36:34.971
I wore them when I took
my SAT's and I got 2360.

36:36.538 --> 36:37.305
Here.

36:39.075 --> 36:40.076
Nana Deelep.

36:42.211 --> 36:43.746
And Nani Meena.

36:45.915 --> 36:46.883
Will guide you tonight.

36:48.584 --> 36:49.786
Okay, let's go.

36:53.823 --> 36:55.457
Will you
ever get a bag?

37:00.328 --> 37:02.031
One sec, I forgot something.

37:03.199 --> 37:04.967
Tell Fiona that
we're heading out.

37:09.639 --> 37:11.140
Hey, you still coming tonight?

37:14.076 --> 37:14.944
Yeah!

37:27.723 --> 37:29.524
Izzy matched with JuJu?

37:31.828 --> 37:32.995
Last night was fun.

37:33.029 --> 37:34.030
Wanna hang again?

37:51.881 --> 37:53.950
Okay, I'm ready.

37:53.983 --> 37:55.184
Is Fiona meeting us there?

37:55.218 --> 37:56.886
I bet she's already at
Big Blue and making out

37:56.919 --> 37:58.553
with Elise on the dance floor.

37:59.354 --> 38:00.122
You coming?

38:01.691 --> 38:02.925
Yeah.

38:02.959 --> 38:04.093
You okay?

38:05.328 --> 38:06.062
Yeah.

38:07.864 --> 38:09.732
Take your phone back.

38:12.201 --> 38:13.936
- Just wait.
- Okay.

38:13.970 --> 38:16.438
Make sure that I don't
chicken out, okay.

38:16.471 --> 38:17.372
Who do you think crushed me?

38:17.405 --> 38:18.373
Do you think Nolan crushed me?

38:18.406 --> 38:19.809
Oh my God, if Nolan crushed me,

38:19.842 --> 38:21.811
my heart is going to explode.

38:22.845 --> 38:25.147
- God, I'm so nervous.
- Hmm hmm.

38:29.986 --> 38:32.955
This isn't even the right place.

38:32.989 --> 38:33.789
No shit.

38:35.224 --> 38:36.626
They're gonna stop letting
people into the crush party

38:36.659 --> 38:37.927
in 12 minutes.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.896
Of course, they only
had to say Big Blue.

38:39.929 --> 38:42.031
That's not even an address.

38:42.064 --> 38:45.334
Does anyone here feel that
we're a part of a big joke?

38:52.108 --> 38:55.945
Izzy, it's not a
great disappointment.

38:55.978 --> 38:57.479
Everything happens for a reason.

39:00.983 --> 39:02.018
Hot.

39:15.097 --> 39:17.867
Hello Instagram friends.

39:17.900 --> 39:21.170
This is Fiona, I just
wanted to update you all.

39:21.203 --> 39:24.006
I am alive and
alone in this park.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.809
And I'm going to the party.

39:26.842 --> 39:29.145
Hmm, I don't like that.

39:38.621 --> 39:39.355
Oh my God.

39:43.826 --> 39:45.094
LOL, nice.

39:45.127 --> 39:46.862
You going to the
crush party later?

39:51.600 --> 39:52.935
- Please don't.
- I actually don't know.

39:52.969 --> 39:54.170
But I'm gonna trust
you on this one.

39:54.203 --> 39:56.205
Again, don't let me
down and let's go.

39:57.539 --> 40:00.943
Hey, uh, how's the
not studying going?

40:02.611 --> 40:04.013
I think I'm gonna go.

40:04.046 --> 40:05.480
No, wait.

40:05.513 --> 40:07.383
- Uh, have...
- Sorry.

40:07.416 --> 40:09.418
Guys, my friend Paul.

40:11.988 --> 40:14.357
He's one of the nicest
guys I've ever, ever met.

40:14.390 --> 40:16.058
He's actually very
trendy as well.

40:16.092 --> 40:17.460
He's kidding.

40:18.995 --> 40:20.629
But seriously,
this guy is great.

40:20.663 --> 40:21.731
I mean if I were you.

40:23.699 --> 40:25.567
Um, are you going
to Big Blue later?

40:27.937 --> 40:29.638
We got lost.

40:29.672 --> 40:30.572
It's just down the hill.

40:30.606 --> 40:31.807
We'll get you there in time.

40:33.242 --> 40:35.011
- Okay, one.
- Ah!

40:35.044 --> 40:36.178
Two.

40:40.282 --> 40:42.118
Every
one of our body's atoms

40:42.151 --> 40:44.253
is traceable to the Big Bang.

40:44.286 --> 40:46.355
We are made of star matter.

40:46.389 --> 40:48.657
We are not simply
in the universe.

40:48.691 --> 40:50.126
We are a part of it.

40:50.159 --> 40:51.761
We are born.

40:51.794 --> 40:54.830
You might even say we've been
empowered by the universe

40:54.864 --> 40:58.167
to figure it out and
we've only just begun.

41:06.675 --> 41:07.977
Oh my God, Izzy.

41:20.089 --> 41:21.090
Are you okay?

41:23.125 --> 41:25.861
Deelep and Meena,
they saved me.

41:27.797 --> 41:28.731
Uh, okay.

41:28.764 --> 41:29.532
Let me just.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.135
Whoa, oh my God,
that's so sweet.

41:33.169 --> 41:35.237
Thank you so much.

41:35.271 --> 41:36.172
What time is it?

41:38.274 --> 41:39.241
It's 10:57.

41:39.275 --> 41:40.509
Three minutes, hmm!

41:42.378 --> 41:44.113
Sorry about your skateboard.

41:44.146 --> 41:46.949
Sorry, she's
embarrassing sometimes.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.117
Dude.

41:48.150 --> 41:50.152
She breaks your board.

41:50.186 --> 41:51.520
What's next, your heart?

41:53.089 --> 41:55.758
This isn't a Soviet film,
this is your life, man.

41:56.792 --> 41:57.660
Can you shut up?

41:58.928 --> 42:02.064
So frustrating.

42:02.098 --> 42:05.134
That no one takes my art
seriously because I'm an athlete.

42:06.469 --> 42:10.506
- Izzy.
- Ah, I feel really weird.

42:10.539 --> 42:13.409
Izzy, you're fine, okay.

42:13.442 --> 42:15.111
I have have to go.

42:16.078 --> 42:17.246
You're now will be here soon.

42:18.180 --> 42:20.649
Georgie messaged you on Tinder.

42:20.683 --> 42:21.917
So flirt with him.

42:22.818 --> 42:23.853
Yeah?

42:23.886 --> 42:25.955
I'm gonna go.

42:25.988 --> 42:27.056
What?

42:37.166 --> 42:38.334
Hello, I've been crushed.

42:41.303 --> 42:42.938
Excuse me, sorry.

42:42.972 --> 42:43.772
Izzy.

42:44.707 --> 42:46.742
Isabelle Alden.

42:46.775 --> 42:50.679
A-L-D-E-N, like Baldwin
but not Baldwin.

42:55.518 --> 42:56.318
Just kidding.

43:11.800 --> 43:12.535
Enjoy.

43:13.469 --> 43:15.271
Can I have some of your water?

43:16.640 --> 43:18.040
What the fuck
happened to the music?

43:21.410 --> 43:23.580
There's a cooler
art party down the street.

43:23.613 --> 43:24.914
Let's go to the that.

43:24.947 --> 43:26.248
Come on
guys, come back to ours.

43:26.282 --> 43:27.651
No music.

43:27.683 --> 43:28.984
Don't
make fun of this kid,

43:29.018 --> 43:30.052
he doesn't know what he's doing.

43:30.085 --> 43:31.655
God, okay.

43:37.226 --> 43:39.361
Ah, thank you so much.

43:39.395 --> 43:40.696
Yeah, so I don't know.

43:40.729 --> 43:42.064
It's always just been
like a personal dream

43:42.097 --> 43:44.200
of mine to like break
the sound barrier,

43:44.233 --> 43:47.236
jet plane, you
know, Mach 3 or 4.

43:47.269 --> 43:48.270
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

43:48.304 --> 43:49.505
Like Speed Runner.

43:49.538 --> 43:50.806
I'm inside alone.

43:50.839 --> 43:52.576
I don't know what to do.

43:52.609 --> 43:54.243
What, you're already there?

43:54.276 --> 43:55.044
Where's Anuka?

43:55.077 --> 43:56.512
She left.

43:56.545 --> 43:58.380
I've been waiting for
you guys at the playground.

43:58.414 --> 43:59.148
Why?

43:59.181 --> 44:00.716
Eh, whatever.

44:00.749 --> 44:02.051
We didn't have sex.

44:02.084 --> 44:03.385
Running man emoji.

44:03.419 --> 44:05.287
- Break the sound barrier.
- Hmm hmm.

44:05.321 --> 44:10.025
Apparently, cum travels
at 65 miles an hour

44:10.059 --> 44:11.393
which when I found that out,

44:11.427 --> 44:13.630
I'm just like so
scared.

44:13.663 --> 44:15.064
- Wow, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

44:15.097 --> 44:16.600
That's not possible.

44:18.267 --> 44:22.606
That's like double the speed
limit on Main Street, so.

44:24.006 --> 44:25.007
- Oh.
- Yeah.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.542
- Yeah.
- Okay.

44:26.576 --> 44:27.810
- Anyways.
- Yeah, it's like.

44:27.843 --> 44:28.944
Yeah.

44:28.978 --> 44:30.580
But I heard it's even
faster if you eat celery.

44:58.708 --> 44:59.508
Thanks.

45:01.243 --> 45:02.144
It should work now.

45:18.595 --> 45:19.461
I like your shirt.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.264
Thanks, it was my grandpa's.

45:22.298 --> 45:23.600
He was the music producer

45:23.633 --> 45:25.901
of some Christian
Death Metal group.

45:25.934 --> 45:28.738
My grandpa was in
the music industry.

45:28.772 --> 45:29.938
Woe, sick shoes.

45:32.474 --> 45:34.243
Hey, you wanna
help me DJ, make out,

45:34.276 --> 45:36.211
then go home together
and have romantic sex

45:36.245 --> 45:37.880
on my twin Xl bed?

45:37.913 --> 45:40.717
I would love to have
romantic sex with you

45:40.750 --> 45:42.585
on your twin XL bed.

45:52.528 --> 45:53.395
I like your shirt.

45:53.429 --> 45:54.664
What?

45:54.698 --> 45:56.633
I like your shirt,
what does it say?

45:57.499 --> 45:58.567
What?

45:58.601 --> 45:59.535
What does it say?

46:01.103 --> 46:02.571
Your shirt.

46:02.605 --> 46:04.940
I don't know, I got
it at a thrift store.

46:04.973 --> 46:07.443
Oh, cool!

46:07.476 --> 46:09.713
I have a lot of those too.

46:09.746 --> 46:10.946
Yeah, cool.

46:35.537 --> 46:36.606
Have eye sex

46:36.639 --> 46:39.007
with someone on the dance floor.

46:39.041 --> 46:41.477
Deep
like one of his photos.

46:41.510 --> 46:42.645
You don't wanna end

46:42.679 --> 46:44.614
your freshman year
still a virgin, do you?

46:46.014 --> 46:47.449
Hey, you made it?

46:47.483 --> 46:48.951
Yeah.

46:48.984 --> 46:50.854
You smell great.

46:50.886 --> 46:51.887
Thanks.

47:05.735 --> 47:07.069
What
you up too buddy?

47:08.070 --> 47:09.405
I'm not at a party.

47:10.372 --> 47:11.240
Are you smoking?

47:13.308 --> 47:14.209
It's not lit.

47:17.179 --> 47:18.848
Uh, how's the party?

47:18.882 --> 47:20.349
Not lit, either.

47:23.419 --> 47:25.487
Wait, JuJu, you're frozen.

47:27.456 --> 47:28.424
You need a light?

47:34.697 --> 47:35.464
Um.

47:36.766 --> 47:38.400
Can I call you back?

47:38.434 --> 47:39.501
Wait, wait, who's that?

47:39.535 --> 47:40.536
- Bye.
- Who's that guy...

47:43.907 --> 47:45.708
I'm trying to quit, so.

47:45.742 --> 47:47.577
So, you fake smoke at parties?

47:48.544 --> 47:49.978
You mind if I join you for one?

47:50.012 --> 47:51.280
Um hmm.

47:51.313 --> 47:52.114
Anuka, right?

47:53.315 --> 47:54.950
Yeah.

47:54.983 --> 47:57.453
So uh, who's JuJu?

47:59.254 --> 48:01.256
My boyfriend, I guess.

48:01.290 --> 48:02.090
I guess?

48:05.628 --> 48:07.463
Wait, how come
you're not inside?

48:08.598 --> 48:10.767
I wasn't crushed.

48:12.669 --> 48:14.036
What do you mean?

48:14.069 --> 48:16.538
I mean, that
nobody crushed me.

48:17.907 --> 48:21.276
Wait so if you weren't
crushed, that means.

48:23.780 --> 48:25.715
Izzy got crushed for real.

48:29.919 --> 48:32.655
What?

48:32.689 --> 48:34.657
Wait, you weren't
crushed for real?

48:34.691 --> 48:36.525
Well, you
don't have to rub it in.

48:36.558 --> 48:37.326
No.

48:39.194 --> 48:40.162
Sorry.

49:25.374 --> 49:28.310
I just feel like your background
deserves more than this.

49:29.846 --> 49:31.280
Like.

49:31.313 --> 49:33.883
- Your cultural...
- Oh!

49:33.917 --> 49:36.786
So you mean, I should
put all the Hindu gods

49:36.819 --> 49:37.921
all over the place?

49:37.954 --> 49:39.254
- No, I mean...
- No.

49:39.288 --> 49:41.423
Just like if this
is a self-portrait.

49:41.456 --> 49:43.693
Yeah, which is ugly
because I am ugly.

49:43.726 --> 49:44.560
- No.
- No.

49:44.594 --> 49:46.328
What?

49:46.361 --> 49:49.531
Uh, it just doesn't seem
as unique as you do.

49:49.565 --> 49:51.166
It's okay.

49:51.199 --> 49:53.937
I, look, I've just seen
some stuff like this before.

49:53.970 --> 49:57.539
Oh.

49:57.573 --> 49:59.709
I can be kind of
an asshole, I know.

49:59.742 --> 50:01.644
Yeah, I've heard that.

50:01.678 --> 50:02.579
- Yeah?
- Hmm hmm.

50:02.612 --> 50:04.146
What have you heard?

50:04.179 --> 50:07.650
That you wrote a
sexist crossword puzzle

50:07.684 --> 50:09.619
in a newspaper or something.

50:11.020 --> 50:12.589
All right, I didn't even
think it was that bad.

50:12.622 --> 50:13.856
Oh.

50:13.890 --> 50:16.793
The clue was the
skin around the vagina

50:16.826 --> 50:18.527
for a five letter word.

50:20.597 --> 50:21.598
Labia?

50:23.265 --> 50:24.067
Woman.

50:25.635 --> 50:28.805
I guess it incorporates my
cis, straight white male,

50:28.838 --> 50:30.673
privilege background
pretty nicely.

50:30.707 --> 50:32.240
Hmm hmm, definitely.

50:35.177 --> 50:36.478
Ew, JuJu?

50:39.214 --> 50:40.515
Hi.

50:40.549 --> 50:42.051
Izzy said you left?

50:43.418 --> 50:47.289
- Hey, I'm Fiona.
- Hey, I'm Rex.

50:47.322 --> 50:48.625
Yeah, I know who you are.

50:48.658 --> 50:50.559
You're the vagina man.

50:52.829 --> 50:53.663
Um, where's Izzy?

50:53.696 --> 50:54.931
Inside.

50:54.964 --> 50:57.634
Oh, Izzy's on her
way to bonetown.

50:58.801 --> 51:02.137
Welcome, welcome
to the bonetown.

51:03.606 --> 51:04.941
No, you don't know that song?

51:04.974 --> 51:06.743
Nope, no I don't, do you.

51:06.776 --> 51:07.777
Hmm hmm, no.

51:07.810 --> 51:09.244
Hmm, that's fine.

51:09.277 --> 51:12.015
Have you seen Elise,
'cause she slummed my DM's.

51:12.048 --> 51:14.651
Well, she's probably inside.

51:14.684 --> 51:17.519
But they won't let you
in if you're not crushed.

51:17.552 --> 51:19.154
They won't let
me in if I'm not,

51:19.187 --> 51:20.155
what are you talking about?

51:20.188 --> 51:21.456
Let's just go through a window.

51:36.839 --> 51:39.307
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes.

51:43.445 --> 51:44.947
Hey you guys,

51:44.981 --> 51:47.416
we can just get in
through the back door?

51:47.449 --> 51:48.785
What!

51:52.822 --> 51:54.523
You know, I'm not gay, right?

51:55.357 --> 51:57.192
No, not me either.

51:57.225 --> 51:58.360
Okay, good.

53:19.041 --> 53:19.809
Shit!

53:21.210 --> 53:21.978
Shit.

53:25.615 --> 53:28.017
They were a part of my
great grandmother's dowry.

53:29.518 --> 53:33.756
My great grandparents soul
is preserved in these.

53:33.790 --> 53:35.792
Soon to be followed
by my grandparents

53:36.926 --> 53:38.426
and my parents and then me.

53:39.762 --> 53:40.630
Come on grandma.

53:43.065 --> 53:44.432
Tell me where grandpa is.

53:52.275 --> 53:53.142
One sec.

54:06.889 --> 54:07.857
I thought you left.

54:08.991 --> 54:10.293
I made out with Georgie.

54:10.325 --> 54:12.128
He smelled like a
kitty litter box.

54:12.161 --> 54:13.328
Cool.

54:17.700 --> 54:19.168
Wait, are you?

54:19.202 --> 54:22.305
Hey, hey, hey,
Nolan's over there.

54:22.337 --> 54:24.539
Go and make out with him.

54:24.573 --> 54:26.175
I already made
a fool of myself.

54:26.209 --> 54:27.777
Izzy, come on.

54:27.810 --> 54:29.679
I'm gonna find Elise, just
go make out with Nolan.

54:29.712 --> 54:31.513
Okay, please, yes, thank you.

55:27.770 --> 55:30.172
All right,
gig's up folks.

55:30.206 --> 55:32.407
Too many noise complaints.

56:06.008 --> 56:08.044
Anuka, someone crushed me.

56:35.104 --> 56:36.272
Did you guys leave?

56:47.316 --> 56:48.317
Izzy?

56:48.351 --> 56:51.120
Hey Izzy, aw, are you okay?

56:51.153 --> 56:53.089
Dispatch,
put me at the house party.

56:54.156 --> 56:55.490
Fiona, those are my shoes!

56:55.523 --> 56:57.360
Your friend has my shoes.

56:57.393 --> 56:58.160
What the fuck!

56:58.194 --> 56:59.595
She vomited on them.

56:59.628 --> 57:01.964
You took those
from the bowling alley

57:01.998 --> 57:03.132
and didn't tell me?

57:03.165 --> 57:04.767
You knew I got in trouble?

57:04.800 --> 57:06.635
You have
this young lady's shoes?

57:07.703 --> 57:09.171
Give me my shoes back.

57:09.205 --> 57:10.706
That's actually psychotic?

57:10.740 --> 57:11.907
You realize that
you're the reason

57:11.941 --> 57:13.376
I might get fired right,

57:13.409 --> 57:15.044
like you're the reason
College Lanes might close.

57:15.077 --> 57:16.345
You know, I love
working there Izzy.

57:16.379 --> 57:18.214
I got a whole lecture today.

57:19.782 --> 57:23.019
I guess you should have stayed
at home and studied.

57:25.154 --> 57:26.554
I think maybe you
should come with me

57:26.589 --> 57:28.391
and sober up a little
bit young lady.

57:40.236 --> 57:42.705
I love y'all like you're
my own but you're a lot.

57:43.873 --> 57:44.774
You a freshman?

57:44.807 --> 57:46.075
I have a speech for freshmen

57:46.108 --> 57:47.476
who don't their
substance limits.

57:47.510 --> 57:48.778
I like to remind you kids

57:48.811 --> 57:50.946
that the world ain't
easy all the time.

57:50.980 --> 57:52.214
You're all just fishes.

57:52.248 --> 57:54.850
Swimming upstream, fins
against the current.

57:54.884 --> 57:56.551
When you're in college,
it's easy to forget

57:56.585 --> 57:59.055
that we're all just a school
of fish who are people.

57:59.088 --> 58:01.090
On this Earth for
different reasons

58:01.123 --> 58:02.758
but swimming in the same waters.

58:04.060 --> 58:06.062
Izzy, 19.

58:06.095 --> 58:08.030
I have a decent Yelp review.

58:08.064 --> 58:09.465
Look me up.

58:09.498 --> 58:13.568
Cat emoji, heart emoji,
smiling poop face emoji.

58:13.602 --> 58:15.805
I seem like the biggest weirdo.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.909
Most important,

58:19.942 --> 58:20.843
love yourself.

58:21.944 --> 58:23.212
Keep that love somewhere
around your mind

58:23.245 --> 58:25.114
like a love fish.

58:25.147 --> 58:26.382
He's a slippery fellow.

58:26.415 --> 58:29.085
But if you ever find
yourself lost or unsure,

58:29.118 --> 58:31.187
just try catching that
love fish and hold on tight

58:31.220 --> 58:32.254
and don't let go.

58:38.360 --> 58:40.396
Oh shoot, I'm sorry.

58:41.664 --> 58:43.232
I thought today
would be the night

58:43.265 --> 58:47.203
I had to leap and mean
it and they're souls

58:47.236 --> 58:49.138
and they're good
luck but not for me.

58:49.171 --> 58:51.340
My friends, they don't get it

58:51.373 --> 58:54.343
because it's never
been hard for them.

58:54.376 --> 58:57.012
They just look at a guy

58:57.046 --> 58:58.948
and he comes to
them and that's it.

59:00.449 --> 59:02.485
They're kissing and hanging out

59:02.518 --> 59:06.755
and holding stupid hands
and watching stupid movies

59:06.789 --> 59:08.224
and laughing at stupid jokes

59:08.257 --> 59:11.694
and all that other stupid,
cute shit that I want.

59:11.727 --> 59:14.163
I'm sorry, I was just
talking about self love.

59:14.196 --> 59:15.698
I'm so cool.

59:15.731 --> 59:18.267
Like what is the
reason for all of this?

59:18.300 --> 59:20.069
Like honestly, I
have a good body.

59:20.102 --> 59:23.139
And my dad always said that
I had a good sense of humor

59:23.172 --> 59:25.508
and I know that there
are like worse things

59:25.541 --> 59:26.675
in the world to worry about

59:26.709 --> 59:28.310
so I try not to think about.

59:28.344 --> 59:29.845
They're too much,
I get too upset.

59:29.879 --> 59:33.816
But I just really, wanted
to like finally have sex!

59:51.300 --> 59:52.468
Can I have some gum?

59:54.303 --> 59:55.704
Yeah, sure.

59:55.738 --> 59:56.539
Thanks.

59:59.441 --> 01:00:01.110
And then I gave my
roommate back his first suit

01:00:01.143 --> 01:00:02.344
Guys, wait up.

01:00:02.378 --> 01:00:04.380
After I got it dry
cleaned of course.

01:00:04.413 --> 01:00:06.182
And uh.

01:00:08.585 --> 01:00:11.020
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.053 --> 01:00:13.189
Um, do you know where Izzy is?

01:00:15.224 --> 01:00:16.425
I don't know who that is.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.061
No, why?

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:21.697
I'm just looking for her.

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.165
It's something personal.

01:00:23.199 --> 01:00:25.768
Sorry, to disturb you guys.

01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:26.936
It's cool, man.

01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:28.270
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:28.304 --> 01:00:29.639
I should be fine.

01:00:29.673 --> 01:00:30.873
Okay.

01:00:30.906 --> 01:00:32.208
- All right.
- Okay.

01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:33.943
Okay, cool, nice
meeting you dude.

01:00:33.976 --> 01:00:35.144
I'll see you guys.

01:00:35.177 --> 01:00:36.245
- Yeah, definitely.
- Good night.

01:00:47.691 --> 01:00:49.325
I know I'm intimidating.

01:00:53.429 --> 01:00:54.797
Girls find me intimidating.

01:00:55.998 --> 01:00:57.499
I always have to
make the first move.

01:00:59.435 --> 01:01:02.672
Oh, well, I mean,
you're like really pretty

01:01:02.706 --> 01:01:04.373
and really cool, so.

01:01:04.406 --> 01:01:05.374
That makes sense.

01:01:09.278 --> 01:01:10.913
But you're also like,

01:01:10.946 --> 01:01:15.284
by far the sexiest bowler I've
ever seen working here, so.

01:01:21.725 --> 01:01:23.292
This powder stuff
is really cool.

01:01:24.694 --> 01:01:27.863
I took intro to drawing
class my freshman year.

01:01:27.896 --> 01:01:29.765
I was gonna be this
studio art minor.

01:01:32.401 --> 01:01:35.304
But we were suppose
to do a self-portrait

01:01:35.337 --> 01:01:37.439
and I showed mine to the class

01:01:37.473 --> 01:01:38.774
and everyone thought
it was a bottle

01:01:38.807 --> 01:01:40.509
even though I was trying to...

01:01:48.017 --> 01:01:50.019
And uh, I um.

01:01:51.954 --> 01:01:54.323
I'm in an open relationship.

01:01:56.959 --> 01:01:58.695
Uh oh, okay.

01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:00.796
I was wondering about that.

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:47.409
Here, drink this.

01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:50.946
Read this.

01:02:52.782 --> 01:02:53.549
And this.

01:02:55.284 --> 01:02:56.085
And this one.

01:02:58.354 --> 01:03:00.356
You should probably
read all of these.

01:03:00.389 --> 01:03:01.691
Just, I'll take you home.

01:03:10.466 --> 01:03:11.200
Thanks.

01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:13.502
What's your name?

01:03:13.535 --> 01:03:15.471
Officer Mike's the name.

01:03:15.504 --> 01:03:16.538
Mike.

01:03:16.572 --> 01:03:17.306
Yeah.

01:03:19.308 --> 01:03:21.510
I'm sorry you had to
deal with me tonight.

01:03:22.612 --> 01:03:24.581
Don't worry,
you're not to blame.

01:03:24.614 --> 01:03:26.816
It's your parent's fault
for not raising you right.

01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:35.524
You always
come in here alone though.

01:03:35.557 --> 01:03:38.227
Yeah, my friends hate bowling.

01:03:39.395 --> 01:03:40.462
Yeah, I know.

01:03:41.997 --> 01:03:44.701
They think it's like, just
for old people which it is,

01:03:44.734 --> 01:03:45.501
kind of.

01:03:45.534 --> 01:03:47.002
This place may close.

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:47.804
What?

01:03:47.837 --> 01:03:49.104
Yeah.

01:03:49.138 --> 01:03:50.607
You guys should
like, I don't know.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.810
You should try and
make it like more cool

01:03:53.843 --> 01:03:55.511
and like hipster and stuff.

01:03:56.378 --> 01:03:57.946
Like, do like theme nights.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.915
Like you guys could do
like a Big Lebowskiy night

01:03:59.948 --> 01:04:00.983
or something.

01:04:01.016 --> 01:04:02.551
Yeah, you could guys could
do like White Russians

01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:03.787
- and have like a bar.
- Huh.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.421
I don't know, that
might bring people in.

01:04:05.454 --> 01:04:06.522
That's good.

01:04:11.795 --> 01:04:15.431
Don't forget to wash your
feet before you go to sleep.

01:04:15.464 --> 01:04:16.599
Otherwise, you'll get sick.

01:04:19.268 --> 01:04:20.402
Thanks, again.

01:04:23.138 --> 01:04:24.808
Yeah.

01:05:12.622 --> 01:05:15.023
Shit.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:29.706
Anuka, please, please answer.

01:05:29.739 --> 01:05:31.106
Please, please,
please, please, please.

01:05:31.139 --> 01:05:32.207
Hi, it's Anuka.

01:05:32.241 --> 01:05:33.542
- No.
- Leave me a message.

01:05:33.576 --> 01:05:36.078
And I'll call you back, thanks.

01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:50.058
Anuka.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.932
Anuka!

01:05:59.002 --> 01:06:00.670
Anuka, you have my keys!

01:06:01.638 --> 01:06:02.639
Anuka!

01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:08.110
Anuka!

01:06:12.447 --> 01:06:14.550
Izzy, shut up!

01:06:14.584 --> 01:06:15.919
I've been calling
and texting you.

01:06:15.952 --> 01:06:17.252
You have my keys.

01:06:17.286 --> 01:06:18.988
Yeah, well
I've been sleeping.

01:06:20.422 --> 01:06:22.324
Did you have a fun night?

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.258
Yeah.

01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:24.526
Why are you being weird to me?

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.862
I'm not being weird.

01:06:25.895 --> 01:06:27.529
Yes you are, look at me.

01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:30.499
What?

01:06:36.639 --> 01:06:38.473
Did you sleep with Julius?

01:06:38.507 --> 01:06:39.976
What?

01:06:40.009 --> 01:06:41.276
No.

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.245
So you're trying to
tell me that you did not

01:06:43.278 --> 01:06:44.513
go on a Tinder date with him?

01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:47.282
Yeah, at the beginning
of the year, we.

01:06:47.316 --> 01:06:48.550
Talked and got burritos.

01:06:48.585 --> 01:06:50.019
Yeah, and why didn't
you tell me this?

01:06:50.053 --> 01:06:51.988
'Cause I didn't think
it was a big deal.

01:06:52.021 --> 01:06:56.158
My current boyfriend tried
sleeping with my best friend.

01:06:56.191 --> 01:06:57.694
We didn't sleep together.

01:06:57.727 --> 01:06:59.494
Oh and you
want me to believe that?

01:06:59.528 --> 01:07:00.730
- Yes because...
- Because!

01:07:00.763 --> 01:07:01.965
- Because...
- Because what!

01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:03.900
Because I'm a virgin!

01:07:07.804 --> 01:07:09.606
What about Travis?

01:07:14.978 --> 01:07:18.280
So you've been lying
to me this whole year?

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.285
Izzy, pick someone
and fuck them already.

01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:25.520
It's not a big deal.

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.894
There's so many guys that
are attracted to you.

01:07:33.295 --> 01:07:36.231
You certainly don't
think that's true.

01:07:47.175 --> 01:07:50.880
I was just trying to
boost your confidence.

01:07:52.115 --> 01:07:54.516
How about you give
me my earrings back

01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:56.853
and let's just call
it a night please.

01:08:04.661 --> 01:08:06.294
Izzy, can I have
my earrings back?

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:19.742
I'm really sorry.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.180
I lost the other one.

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:28.718
You what?

01:08:29.752 --> 01:08:31.688
At the party.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.388
Are you serious?

01:08:34.991 --> 01:08:35.792
I just...

01:08:47.636 --> 01:08:48.904
Fuck!

01:09:18.265 --> 01:09:22.004
Yo hey, I never thanked
you for saving the party,

01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:24.272
earlier.

01:09:24.305 --> 01:09:26.441
No, no, no, no problemo.

01:09:28.745 --> 01:09:30.613
Nolan, who you talking to?

01:09:32.814 --> 01:09:33.750
Okay, bye.

01:09:34.951 --> 01:09:36.886
Hey, do you wanna
hang out for a bit?

01:09:40.923 --> 01:09:42.591
So how come we've
never met before?

01:09:43.893 --> 01:09:44.761
We did.

01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:47.261
At orientation.

01:09:47.295 --> 01:09:50.198
Oh, I was high
like that whole week.

01:09:51.134 --> 01:09:53.301
You do music stuff?

01:09:53.335 --> 01:09:56.471
I played bass for like
a month in middle school.

01:09:58.141 --> 01:10:00.342
So that like doesn't
really count.

01:10:00.375 --> 01:10:01.911
I bet you have a
good voice, like,

01:10:01.944 --> 01:10:04.379
high pitched, talk rat moaning.

01:10:04.412 --> 01:10:06.281
Yeah, accurate.

01:10:06.314 --> 01:10:07.482
So sexy.

01:10:08.918 --> 01:10:10.119
Thanks.

01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:29.538
Do you wanna join?

01:10:34.309 --> 01:10:36.212
And I'll trick behind you.

01:10:39.314 --> 01:10:41.483
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:18.855 --> 01:11:20.990
I have a final tomorrow.

01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:22.925
This has been great.

01:11:22.959 --> 01:11:24.526
Have a good summer.

01:12:53.349 --> 01:12:56.085
Guys, I'm so sorry
I was such an idiot

01:12:56.118 --> 01:12:57.987
and a horrible
friend last night.

01:12:59.422 --> 01:13:02.058
Anuka, I won't leave campus
until I find the earring.

01:13:02.091 --> 01:13:04.927
And Fiona, I'll obvi
apologize to Elise and Tony

01:13:04.961 --> 01:13:06.796
about the shoes.

01:13:06.829 --> 01:13:09.231
I'm gonna miss you ladies
so much this summer.

01:13:09.265 --> 01:13:12.902
I wouldn't have survived
freshman year without you both.

01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:16.038
Heart emoji, praise hands
emoji, family emoji.

01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:20.977
You still alive
after last night?

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:22.812
Trying.

01:13:22.845 --> 01:13:24.280
You?

01:13:24.313 --> 01:13:25.848
Yeah, you know, I've been
here since six, chugging coffee.

01:13:25.881 --> 01:13:26.682
Bam!

01:13:27.984 --> 01:13:30.485
Um, how was the
rest of your night?

01:13:30.518 --> 01:13:33.089
You know, just uh.

01:13:35.324 --> 01:13:38.961
Typical, typical
party stuff, whew!

01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:40.997
I have a final that
I have to, go to.

01:13:42.164 --> 01:13:42.965
Cheers.

01:13:44.133 --> 01:13:45.167
Cheers to you.

01:13:56.379 --> 01:13:58.948
You make things hard
for yourself, don't you?

01:14:04.987 --> 01:14:05.788
Thanks.

01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:09.625
- You have an exam now.
- Yeah, Astro 101.

01:14:11.327 --> 01:14:13.295
Cool well, see ya.

01:14:13.329 --> 01:14:14.096
Good luck.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.075
- Shoes?
- Found the shoes.

01:14:26.108 --> 01:14:27.176
- Good.
- Tony.

01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:28.177
What?

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.046
I have a solution.

01:14:30.079 --> 01:14:30.980
- Hit me.
- Okay.

01:14:32.882 --> 01:14:33.883
Theme nights.

01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:36.786
Bedazzle Raffle.

01:14:36.819 --> 01:14:38.487
Disco night.

01:14:38.521 --> 01:14:39.422
Ladies night.

01:14:39.455 --> 01:14:41.023
I just really think that,

01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:44.427
we just need to get
people in here, you know.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:46.762
I think the themes
will bring people in,

01:14:46.796 --> 01:14:48.964
people love that,
they can Instagram it.

01:14:48.998 --> 01:14:51.801
- I just...
- Hmm hmm, hmm hmm.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:56.138
This one could work.

01:14:56.172 --> 01:14:57.239
- Bedazzle Raffle.
- Hmm hmm.

01:14:57.273 --> 01:14:58.874
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:14:58.908 --> 01:15:00.142
- Diamonds.
- I like the diamonds.

01:15:00.176 --> 01:15:01.977
Hmm hmm.

01:15:02.011 --> 01:15:02.912
My grandma liked diamonds.

01:15:02.945 --> 01:15:04.213
You know I like my grandma.

01:15:04.246 --> 01:15:05.347
- Neon...
- Neon.

01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:06.916
- But no, for sure.
- Hmm hmm.

01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:07.817
- Hmm hmm.
- For sure.

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:08.617
Hmm hmm.

01:15:09.685 --> 01:15:10.586
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:10.619 --> 01:15:11.253
- Cool.
- Thank you.

01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:12.088
Yeah.

01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:14.056
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:15.491
Okay.

01:15:23.299 --> 01:15:26.102
Thanks, let me know
about the earring.

01:15:26.135 --> 01:15:27.736
I'll post about it on Facebook.

01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:30.139
I'm gonna miss you both.

01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:32.341
Let's make sure we FaceTime.

01:15:32.374 --> 01:15:33.976
Kissing face emoji.

01:15:34.009 --> 01:15:37.146
It's fine Izzy, actually.

01:15:37.179 --> 01:15:38.747
Elise and I stayed up all night

01:15:38.781 --> 01:15:41.217
'cause she had a really great
idea for saving the lanes.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:42.751
It was hot.

01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:45.054
Fire emoji.

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:47.990
I can't believe you threw
up on her white shoes, LOL.

01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:51.026
Crush that astro exam, okay?

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.561
Love you, winky face.

01:16:06.208 --> 01:16:07.977
Good morning, good morning.

01:16:08.844 --> 01:16:11.147
Now, we will all.

01:16:18.254 --> 01:16:19.855
Now we will all stand.

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.958
Yes, yes, everyone
up on your feet.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.962
As I like to do
before every exam.

01:16:26.996 --> 01:16:30.900
And reach your arms
up the heavens.

01:16:30.933 --> 01:16:34.103
Up to the celestial sphere
and ask for some support

01:16:34.136 --> 01:16:36.238
from the sky on this exam.

01:16:37.573 --> 01:16:39.074
You may be seated.

01:16:42.077 --> 01:16:43.580
Izzy.

01:16:43.613 --> 01:16:45.681
There are 50
multiple choice questions

01:16:45.714 --> 01:16:47.149
on this exam.

01:16:47.183 --> 01:16:48.517
Hi Meena.

01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:50.819
And 10
short answer responses.

01:16:52.254 --> 01:16:55.524
All the equations you need
are on the back of the test.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.596
Hey, it's Oliver.

01:16:59.629 --> 01:17:02.264
Uh, I found your earring
last night, funny story.

01:17:02.298 --> 01:17:05.301
Would you want to grab coffee
or something for the exam?

01:17:10.773 --> 01:17:13.809
You're a star, winky face.

01:17:13.842 --> 01:17:17.146
How about a celebratory
coffee after the exam?

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.719
As I'm
sure that you do as well.

01:17:23.752 --> 01:17:24.853
You may begin.
