00:12.700 --> 00:15.730
Hey, hello, yo, everyone, hey, yo!

00:15.730 --> 00:18.240
- What's up?
- Shh!

00:18.250 --> 00:20.510
Before anyone says anything...

00:20.510 --> 00:23.740
I did not see the finale of
American Voice last night.

00:23.740 --> 00:26.070
- Oh, well...
- Shush!

00:26.070 --> 00:31.040
I recorded it. It's on my DVR. And I'm
watching it as soon as I get home tonight.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.160
- Okay but...
- D'ah!

00:34.490 --> 00:38.490
I've watched every episode this
season for the past four months!

00:38.490 --> 00:43.340
So please, no one tell
me who won last night.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.380
Please?

00:45.810 --> 00:46.770
Sebastian won.

00:46.770 --> 00:49.120
Ah dang it!

00:49.120 --> 00:53.250
I'm sorry. Seriously, I
just couldn't help myself.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.110
Oh, here I am!

00:55.120 --> 00:57.050
How's everyone doing today?!

00:57.050 --> 01:01.550
Anyone wanna talk about what I'm wearing?

01:02.890 --> 01:04.349
It's a...

01:04.349 --> 01:06.750
Pajelehoocho!

01:06.890 --> 01:09.600
A jelly-joo-ish-who-what?

01:09.600 --> 01:11.240
Pajelehoocho!

01:11.240 --> 01:14.050
They're pajamas! They're jeans!
They're leggings!

01:14.050 --> 01:16.400
It's a hoodie! It's a poncho!

01:16.400 --> 01:19.100
The Pajelehoocho!

01:19.610 --> 01:22.680
I think I've seen the
Pajelehoocho advertised on TV.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.440
Yeah, I got the commercial right here.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.910
Oh!

01:25.910 --> 01:28.970
- Cool.
- Let's see.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.920
Do your clothes make you
feel uncomfortable?

01:31.920 --> 01:33.970
Have you ever thought to yourself...

01:33.970 --> 01:36.750
"Man, I wish I could wear
something comfortable,

01:36.750 --> 01:39.060
that'll make me feel normal and popular"?

01:39.060 --> 01:41.130
That'll never happen.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.730
- Shut up!
- What the!

01:43.730 --> 01:45.800
It's the Pajelehoocho!

01:45.800 --> 01:48.590
They're pajamas! They're jeans!
They're leggings!

01:48.590 --> 01:50.300
It's a hoodie! It's a poncho!

01:50.300 --> 01:53.600
It's the... Pajelehoocho!

01:53.610 --> 01:56.150
Hey! Is that a Pajelehoocho?!

01:56.150 --> 01:58.550
It sure is.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.650
The Pajelehoocho!

02:04.180 --> 02:07.280
And, when I went online
to Pajelehoocho dot com,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.229
they said I could have free
shipping if I bought a...

02:10.229 --> 02:11.990
"A gross".

02:11.990 --> 02:15.790
- Cat.
- That's one hundred and forty-four.

02:15.800 --> 02:20.790
You bought a hundred and
forty-four Pajelehoochos?

03:27.050 --> 03:30.750
See, the idea is, we all prepare a scene...

03:30.750 --> 03:33.490
Then we board a city bus...

03:33.490 --> 03:39.210
And as we ride along, we perform
the scene for the bus passengers!

03:39.210 --> 03:41.070
Heh?

03:41.260 --> 03:42.680
Huh?

03:42.680 --> 03:45.790
You want us to do a play for
people who ride the bus?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.690
In Los Angeles?

03:47.690 --> 03:51.760
Sure! You'll see those bus
passengers will thank us.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, by stabbing us with rusty scissors.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.370
Wait. Isn't he a famous clown?

03:59.370 --> 04:02.010
I don't wanna do a play on a bus.

04:02.010 --> 04:04.770
That's not Andre.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.820
So, none of you want to
do live bus theater?

04:07.820 --> 04:09.880
Not at all.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.850
All right. Ah! Then how about this...

04:13.850 --> 04:17.529
We all do the Broadway musical "Annie"...

04:17.540 --> 04:19.940
Under water.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.690
I don't wanna do a play under water.

04:22.690 --> 04:24.730
My skin will prune up.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.040
None of us wanna do a play under water.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.980
Or on a nasty bus.

04:31.460 --> 04:35.090
I see. All right. No bus play.
No under water musical.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.000
Why don't we all just lie on the floor
and stick our faces in the carpet?

04:38.010 --> 04:40.050
Thusly.

04:41.710 --> 04:45.010
Hmm mm mm hmm mm mm mmm
mm mm mmm-mmm mmm hmm!

04:45.010 --> 04:46.290
What'd he say?

04:46.290 --> 04:50.550
I think he said, "Robbie's mother
sprays his underpants with bug spray".

04:50.550 --> 04:51.690
Rex!

04:51.690 --> 04:56.520
My mom... she's just worried
that I've got roaches.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.820
I think Sikowitz is sad.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.980
I'm not sad.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.130
Just disappointed in you children.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.320
Why?

05:07.330 --> 05:10.540
Because you're all a bunch
of Negative Nancys.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.510
Whiny Willies. Depressing Darnells.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.110
Ah.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.890
Oh! I know an old man named Parnell.

05:17.890 --> 05:20.230
His wife says things to him like...

05:20.230 --> 05:22.340
"Hey Parnell"...

05:22.340 --> 05:27.320
"You wanna eat some
pancakes on a rocket ship?"

05:28.790 --> 05:33.530
Nobody ever knows what
you're talking about.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.680
You have man breath.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.180
What are you bugging about?

05:39.180 --> 05:42.340
I'll tell you about what I'm "buggin"!

05:42.340 --> 05:46.710
When you kids started this class, you
were all bright-tailed and bushy-eyed!

05:46.710 --> 05:50.240
Hungry to learn about being performers!

05:50.240 --> 05:54.020
Now ya don't wanna do nothing!

05:55.220 --> 05:58.700
I might as well just quit.

06:01.460 --> 06:06.680
I should just walk out that
door, never to return.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.930
Your favorite teacher...

06:08.930 --> 06:11.570
Exiting forever.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.270
Okay okay, don't quit. Just...

06:15.270 --> 06:17.360
What do you want us to do?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.550
Be more open-minded!

06:19.550 --> 06:23.910
You've all gotten so good at saying no.

06:23.910 --> 06:28.160
I dare you to spend the rest of this day...

06:28.160 --> 06:29.750
Saying yes!

06:29.750 --> 06:31.790
- To everything?
- That's right.

06:31.790 --> 06:36.360
I'm in. Jade, will you
kiss me on the mouth?

06:36.360 --> 06:37.660
Eh eh eh!

06:37.660 --> 06:41.910
You don't have to say yes to
kissing, or anything dangerous or...

06:41.910 --> 06:43.860
Illegal.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.030
But everything else...

06:46.030 --> 06:48.550
Just say yes.

06:51.010 --> 06:51.910
Will you?

06:51.910 --> 06:53.210
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.040
- I like it.
- Yes. Mazel tov.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.580
Hey! I have a hundred and
forty-three extra Pajelehoochos.

06:58.580 --> 07:01.150
Who wants their very own
super-cozy and fashionable...

07:01.150 --> 07:04.030
Wait! Wait! Robbie!

07:04.710 --> 07:06.880
Will you wear a Pajelehoocho?

07:06.880 --> 07:09.100
Cat, I...

07:10.490 --> 07:12.350
Yes.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.060
That'll be nineteen ninety-five.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.660
Hey guys.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.710
Yeah, I'm on that new show, Divertisimo.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.610
Big hit in Mexico.

07:35.610 --> 07:38.910
- Whatever.
- 'Kay later.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.880
Oh Tori!

07:42.010 --> 07:44.340
Oh my gosh! I wish people
would quit bugging me,

07:44.340 --> 07:48.400
just because I'm one of
the stars of Divertisimo.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.770
Why would people here bug you about a
TV show that's not even on in America?

07:52.770 --> 07:54.650
You mean Divertisimo?

07:54.650 --> 07:56.120
Stop saying it!

07:56.120 --> 07:57.860
- Jealous?
- No.

07:57.860 --> 08:00.240
Because I could totally
understand you being jealous.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.990
Ya know, since it's a high-quality
television show with top-notch acting.

08:03.990 --> 08:06.820
Well, when are you gonna get me a
copy of the show, so I can watch it?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.840
Ugh. Geez Tori, get your own life.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.440
- Hey, Andre...
- Oh!

08:17.440 --> 08:19.310
Hey Posey.

08:19.310 --> 08:21.050
Can I ask you something?

08:21.050 --> 08:22.850
Aw.

08:22.980 --> 08:26.250
See, I need help writing a song for
my creative song-writing class...

08:26.250 --> 08:28.950
Well, good luck!

08:29.650 --> 08:31.360
You are freakishly strong.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.390
That's because I drink
lots of tomato juice.

08:33.390 --> 08:34.690
Do you like tomato juice?

08:34.690 --> 08:37.659
I don't think anyone does.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.330
Going somewhere?

08:39.330 --> 08:42.070
Yeah... yeah... I just
had a bran muffin, so...

08:42.070 --> 08:43.270
Posey!

08:43.270 --> 08:46.500
Were you about to ask
Andre to do something?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.400
Will you help me write a song?

08:48.410 --> 08:50.170
Please?

08:50.180 --> 08:52.040
I...

08:52.790 --> 08:54.650
Yes.

08:54.670 --> 08:56.980
Yes, I will.

08:56.980 --> 08:59.480
Egg... cellent.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.290
I reserved the music room for six
o'clock tonight. See ya there.

09:02.290 --> 09:03.590
Yes.

09:03.590 --> 09:07.900
Ooh! You want me to bring
you some tomato juice?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.760
Yes.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.940
Did she brag about it to you, too?

09:18.940 --> 09:21.410
You mean Divertisimo?

09:21.410 --> 09:23.570
Yes, she mentioned it.

09:23.580 --> 09:24.810
So what are you doing tonight?

09:24.810 --> 09:27.780
I am going to trick my girlfriend.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.950
- Trick her?
- Well, sorta.

09:29.950 --> 09:33.190
You know how she has to
say "yes" to everything?

09:33.190 --> 09:36.290
I'm not sure I need to hear this.

09:36.290 --> 09:38.390
No, no listen...

09:38.390 --> 09:40.590
You know how I love drag racing?

09:40.590 --> 09:42.030
No.

09:42.030 --> 09:46.600
Well, I do, and Jade has always refused to
go to a race with me. She says it's stupid.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.200
I'm voting with Jade on this one.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.500
Don't care. There's a big race
tonight, and Jade is gonna go.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.740
Oh, because of Sikowitz.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.610
Yeah! She has to say yes.

09:57.610 --> 09:59.880
Yeah, very clever...

09:59.880 --> 10:00.950
Hey Tori!

10:00.950 --> 10:03.450
Remember when you asked me to
come over to your house tonight,

10:03.450 --> 10:05.320
to help you make homemade pizza?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.450
Uh, no, not really...

10:07.450 --> 10:08.920
You asked me to do that.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.920
Don't you remember? I want
you to remember that.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.360
Will you please remember that?

10:13.360 --> 10:16.290
Yes. I remember that.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.160
Great, I'll be over your house at seven.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.270
- Wait, I was gonna ask you...
- I already have plans.

10:21.270 --> 10:26.190
Now I have to go to the
drag race by myself.

10:26.770 --> 10:29.050
Drag race?

10:31.200 --> 10:32.730
Yeah.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.630
Well, that just turned my light green.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.840
What?

10:36.840 --> 10:38.400
How many tickets ya got?

10:38.400 --> 10:41.910
- Two, but I...
- Can I go with you?

10:41.910 --> 10:44.420
Sure. We'll go to the drag race together.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.030
Oh yeah!

10:46.030 --> 10:49.630
Gentlemen, start your Sinjins!

10:52.420 --> 10:55.660
Are those Pajelehoochos?!

10:55.790 --> 10:56.760
Yeah!

10:56.760 --> 10:58.620
Yes.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.000
Hey!

11:19.190 --> 11:21.380
This seems like a lot of pizza dough.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.980
Are you sure you read me the recipe right?

11:23.980 --> 11:26.470
Yeah. I said four cups of flour.

11:26.470 --> 11:28.670
You said four pounds of flour!

11:28.670 --> 11:30.960
Oh, I meant four cups.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.240
Aw, great!

11:33.950 --> 11:37.580
Will you get up off your butt and
help me make this stupid pizza?

11:37.580 --> 11:40.350
Ooh! I think that's for me.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.750
Who's here?

11:42.820 --> 11:46.390
Pizza. Comes to sixteen-fifty.

11:46.390 --> 11:49.810
Why would you order a pizza
when we're making pizza?

11:49.820 --> 11:52.460
Because I knew you'd fail.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.350
Can I have twenty dollars to pay this guy?

11:54.350 --> 11:58.540
- No, you cannot have twen...
- Wait I'm sorry, did you just say "no"?

11:58.540 --> 11:59.600
I...

11:59.600 --> 12:02.030
Because I think if Sikowitz
were here, he might say...

12:02.030 --> 12:06.240
"Ooh, someone sounds
like a Negative Nancy".

12:06.240 --> 12:10.690
So, one more time... can
I have twenty dollars?

12:10.690 --> 12:13.330
Give it to me.

12:14.510 --> 12:15.750
Thanks.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.980
Hey, you girls are pretty.

12:17.980 --> 12:20.080
Maybe...

12:21.850 --> 12:25.070
Hi, girls! Sorry, but I can't stay.

12:25.070 --> 12:26.080
Good.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, I gotta head to the studio where
I film my hit TV show that I'm on.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.880
- It's called...
- Divertisimo.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.000
We know.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.260
Yeah. It's a huge, huge hit.

12:35.260 --> 12:37.570
High-quality television
and top-notch acting.

12:37.570 --> 12:39.340
And I'm on it.

12:39.340 --> 12:42.810
Well, did you get me a copy of
an episode yet, so I can see it?

12:42.810 --> 12:44.380
- Ow.
- What?

12:44.380 --> 12:48.010
Oh, my shoulder hurts. Is there
like a bruise or something?

12:48.010 --> 12:49.870
Ewe!

12:50.220 --> 12:52.880
Uh! You have a huge pimple!

12:52.890 --> 12:55.590
Or a small volcano.

12:55.590 --> 12:56.890
I have a pimple?!

12:56.890 --> 12:59.390
Uh, possibly the most disgusting
pimple I've ever seen.

12:59.390 --> 13:02.030
Well, it hurts! Somebody do something!

13:02.030 --> 13:04.070
Jade...

13:04.270 --> 13:07.900
Will you please pop
Trina's shoulder pimple?

13:07.900 --> 13:10.970
- No, absolutely n...
- A'buh buh buh buh!

13:10.970 --> 13:14.270
Is someone being a "Negative Nancy?"

13:14.270 --> 13:16.740
Or a Whiny Willie?"

13:16.740 --> 13:21.110
- You cannot make me pop her sh...
- We made a deal with Sikowitz.

13:21.110 --> 13:24.680
Should I tell our whole class
that you couldn't handle it?

13:24.680 --> 13:28.320
Will someone please just pop my pimple?!

13:28.320 --> 13:30.760
Will you, Jade?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.620
Yes.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.300
Ah!

13:38.480 --> 13:41.360
That's good stuff.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.640
Later.

13:47.010 --> 13:48.440
What's wrong?

13:48.440 --> 13:51.740
Some goo got in my eye.

13:55.250 --> 13:58.180
So, you ready to hear the
song I've been working on?

13:58.180 --> 14:00.790
All... all right.

14:00.790 --> 14:05.710
Okay. But first, a quick
swig of tomato juice.

14:07.530 --> 14:09.360
You want a sip?

14:09.360 --> 14:11.080
No, I...

14:11.080 --> 14:12.940
Yes.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.110
See, it's better warm, isn't it?

14:20.110 --> 14:21.780
Mm?

14:21.780 --> 14:23.880
Mm-hum.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.850
Okay. Now, listen to this.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.670
<i>♪ Well, I was born on the
back of a pickup truck ♪</i>

14:29.670 --> 14:35.130
<i>♪ With a momma named Donna,
and a daddy named Buck ♪</i>

14:35.220 --> 14:37.420
I'm sorry, I had to stop.

14:37.420 --> 14:41.560
Oh, don't be sorry! You stop all you want.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.460
Listen, I know we're not
great friends yet...

14:44.460 --> 14:47.700
But I feel close enough to you
to ask a personal question.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.560
Why?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.100
It's just...

14:51.100 --> 14:54.310
Sometimes people say that...

14:54.310 --> 14:57.180
They say my feet smell weird.

14:57.180 --> 15:02.580
Would you smell my foot, and
tell me what you think?

15:02.720 --> 15:07.940
I dare you to spend one
day saying yes, yes, yes.

15:10.790 --> 15:13.330
Yeah. I'll smell your foot.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.610
Thank you.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.320
Oh. Wah.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.700
Ah!

15:19.700 --> 15:22.530
<i>♪ Then daddy left mom, and

15:22.530 --> 15:27.630
<i>♪ Momma caught a cold,

15:30.380 --> 15:33.710
Ya know, at first I thought these
Pajelehoochos were stupid.

15:33.710 --> 15:38.180
- You did?
- Yeah, but ah, they're so comfortable.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.750
- Ya know why?
- Yep! Cuz they're pajamas!

15:40.750 --> 15:42.250
- They're jeans!
- They're leggings!

15:42.250 --> 15:43.900
- It's a hoodie!
- It's a poncho!

15:43.900 --> 15:47.500
- It's the...
- Pajelehoocho!

15:51.700 --> 15:53.900
Oh my goodness.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.370
- Hey.
- Hold up.

15:55.370 --> 15:57.600
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.600
Are those Pajelehoochos?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.970
- Uh-huh.
- I've seen them on TV.

16:01.970 --> 16:04.580
I have a hundred and
forty-two more at home.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.750
- Oh yeah?
- Then give us those.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.670
What?

16:08.720 --> 16:10.620
You want our Pajelehoochos?

16:10.620 --> 16:12.580
That's what I said.

16:12.590 --> 16:15.790
Sorry, fellas, but all we have
on underneath is underwear.

16:15.790 --> 16:19.590
Wait! Remember what we promised Sikowitz.
We have to say yes to everything.

16:19.590 --> 16:25.490
- But if they take our Pajelehoochos...
- Can we have your Pajelehoochos?

16:26.800 --> 16:29.320
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.310
- I feel normal.
- I feel popular.

16:38.310 --> 16:40.770
Pajelehoochos!

16:48.250 --> 16:49.690
How are we gonna get home?

16:49.690 --> 16:51.850
I dunno.

16:51.890 --> 16:54.430
Well, we can't walk six
blocks in our underwear.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.190
Yeah, no kidding.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.400
What are we gonna do?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.770
Well, we...

17:01.770 --> 17:05.910
We could stay back here and snoodle.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.220
Gross.

17:17.349 --> 17:23.250
So, I guess you could say my "need for
speed" started on my twelfth birthday.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.160
Look at 'em go.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.760
Must be doing close to two hundred.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.260
One ninety-eight.

17:31.260 --> 17:34.020
Nice call, buddy.

17:34.330 --> 17:37.370
- Anyway, my twelfth birthday...
- Yeah?

17:37.370 --> 17:39.600
My uncle helped me build my own race car.

17:39.610 --> 17:40.750
No kidding?

17:40.750 --> 17:45.070
I built a race car when I was twelve.

17:49.780 --> 17:53.420
Something's happening in the pits.
Man, I wish I could see.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.340
Here.

17:55.350 --> 17:56.860
You brought binoculars?

17:56.860 --> 18:01.230
I never go to a race without my binos.

18:01.230 --> 18:03.110
Man, these work great.

18:03.110 --> 18:06.100
Yep. They're good for
checking out the hot cars...

18:06.100 --> 18:09.040
And the hot ladies.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.240
- Ya know what. Sinjin?
- Talk to me.

18:13.240 --> 18:18.380
I wasn't sure about hanging out with
you tonight, but you're a lot of fun.

18:18.380 --> 18:21.440
I will fist to that.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.590
Can we watch anything else?

18:34.590 --> 18:37.760
You don't like celebrities underwater?

18:37.760 --> 18:40.000
No. Because they make you think,

18:40.000 --> 18:44.470
that the celebrities are going
to drown but then they never do.

18:44.470 --> 18:45.840
Let's see what else is on.

18:45.840 --> 18:50.520
- Go to the guide.
- I know how to do it.

18:50.940 --> 18:53.410
No... no... no...

18:53.410 --> 18:55.630
Boring... no news... no...

18:55.630 --> 18:57.470
Wait wait, go back go back!

18:57.470 --> 18:59.070
- Why, what?!
- Just go up!

18:59.070 --> 19:01.600
More... there, look!

19:01.600 --> 19:04.810
The Spanish language channel!

19:04.810 --> 19:07.510
Divertisimo! That's Trina's show!

19:07.510 --> 19:09.080
I thought it wasn't on in LA!

19:09.080 --> 19:10.780
- That's what she said!
- Well, turn it on!

19:10.780 --> 19:13.900
I know how to do it!

19:15.240 --> 19:20.220
<i>No may ko-mas!</i>

19:20.760 --> 19:25.340
<i>No may ko-mas!</i>

19:26.960 --> 19:29.900
That's the show Trina's
been bragging about?

19:29.900 --> 19:34.700
She said it was "high-quality
television with top-notch acting".

19:34.700 --> 19:37.300
She's a giant piece of cheese.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.710
That fibber.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.910
What studio does she film at?

19:41.910 --> 19:44.180
Hollywood-Bronson, why?

19:44.180 --> 19:49.580
Shall we go down there and
pay Trina a little visit?

19:49.780 --> 19:52.480
Indeed we shall.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.490
<i>♪ As we rolled on ♪</i>

19:58.490 --> 20:00.430

20:14.680 --> 20:18.280
So, that's another song I wrote.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.750
Mmm-hmm.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.280
I write tons of songs. All country.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.350
All country.

20:24.350 --> 20:29.190
Anyway, I have about seven
more, if you wanna hear 'em.

20:29.190 --> 20:31.850
I thought you didn't like tomato juice.

20:31.860 --> 20:35.630
Yeah. But maybe if I drink
enough, it'll kill me.

20:35.630 --> 20:37.530
You're so funny.

20:37.530 --> 20:39.000
Okay.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.170
So, here's my next song, unless
you're ready to go home.

20:42.170 --> 20:45.010
No, just go ahead and play...

20:45.010 --> 20:47.410
What? What'd you just ask me?

20:47.410 --> 20:49.180
I just said, do you wanna go home?

20:49.180 --> 20:51.380
Yes! Yes!

20:51.380 --> 20:52.900
Oh yes!

20:52.900 --> 20:54.700
Ah!

20:55.050 --> 20:57.680
Yes! That's my new song.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.580
It's called "yes!"

20:59.580 --> 21:04.390
It's off my new album called,
"Andre's going home now".

21:04.390 --> 21:06.670
All right.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.000
You're sure we can get home like this?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.960
Yep. From here it's all downhill.

21:19.150 --> 21:22.340
Well... we're not going very fast.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.210
I know.

21:24.210 --> 21:27.150
Maybe it'll seem faster
if we both yell "wee!"

21:27.150 --> 21:28.980
We could give it a shot.

21:28.980 --> 21:34.750
Wee...

21:36.770 --> 21:43.570
<i>♪ Ella es el almuerzo ♪</i>

21:43.570 --> 21:45.570

21:47.710 --> 21:50.780

<i>- Gracias.</i>

21:50.780 --> 21:54.480
That was a great scene, Trina.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.740
Really "high-quality television".

21:57.740 --> 21:59.930
"Top-notch-acting".

21:59.940 --> 22:02.040
Why are you here?! Get out!

22:02.040 --> 22:04.360
No, we wanna watch you act.

22:04.360 --> 22:09.900
Yeah. Does lady cheese boob get
away from the hungry mice children?

22:09.900 --> 22:12.330
Trina, are these your <i>amigas?</i>

22:12.340 --> 22:14.910
No. This is my mean sister
and her rude friend.

22:14.910 --> 22:18.750
Hey! Do not call me her friend.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.240
Well, whoever these <i>señoritas</i> may
be, you are both <i>muy </i> pretty.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.610
- Thank you.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

22:23.610 --> 22:24.740
We're just visiting.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.550
Listen, we're about to film our next scene.

22:26.550 --> 22:30.120
Would you like to be in
the show with Trina?

22:30.120 --> 22:31.110
Why her?!

22:31.110 --> 22:34.320
- Thank you, but I'd really rather not...
- A'buh buh buh buh!

22:34.320 --> 22:36.260
Remember the deal with Sikowitz.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.020
- I told you...
- You have to do it.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.170
Yes.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.030
Yes!

22:42.630 --> 22:44.000
Yes.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.510
I will be in the next scene.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.740
Wonderful.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.680
