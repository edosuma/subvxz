00:34.135 --> 00:37.105
So we begin at the end.

00:40.241 --> 00:45.745
After a wild week in Seoul,

00:45.746 --> 00:52.085
there was, I believe,
something called... involved.

00:52.086 --> 00:56.123
There were many strange and
delightful things to eat.

00:56.124 --> 01:04.123
Things might have spun
slightly out of control.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.439

this beautiful world ♪

01:12.440 --> 01:19.779

01:47.641 --> 01:53.580
the biggest difference between
Korean fried chicken and

01:53.581 --> 01:59.552
American fried chicken... I
feel like chicken tonight.

01:59.553 --> 02:05.692
Next, we'll be performing a
medially from flavor town.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.595
Who is everybody here?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.597
Come to me, come to me.

02:10.598 --> 02:17.170
Powerful in a small girly way.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.172
Whoops.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.441
Oh, yeah.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.376
You shouldn't be surprised I'm

02:23.377 --> 02:26.513
in a happy place right now.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.216
Maybe the best way to tell

02:29.217 --> 02:32.619
this story is to
start at the end.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.087
Like a dog returning to its own

02:35.088 --> 02:39.058
vomit, I keep flashing
back to was it last night.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.594
The night before, I smell fried

02:41.595 --> 02:45.265
chicken on my clothes
so perhaps... hello.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.399
We meet again.

02:46.400 --> 02:51.037
Am I glowing with health and
pink, freshly scrubbed?

02:51.038 --> 02:53.139
You look like a better
version of yourself.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.941
Why is that?

02:54.942 --> 02:59.279
Because I've lost about
eight pounds of dead skin.

02:59.280 --> 03:07.280
Koreans like the idea
of optimal cleanness.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.724
We like to be the
most clean possible.

03:11.725 --> 03:15.895
I'm okay frankly
with soap and water.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.230
I like beer.

03:16.231 --> 03:20.099
Let me see if I can pour
this properly for you.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.734
There you go.

03:21.735 --> 03:22.570
Do you know about this?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.237
No.

03:23.238 --> 03:27.073
The Koreans have many
eating traditions.

03:27.074 --> 03:31.411
If you have a very big
production or big event, you

03:31.412 --> 03:33.145
celebrate that in a proper way.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.448
What are we celebrating?

03:35.449 --> 03:40.920
We're celebrating the
end of this Korea show.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.789
This is important.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.792
This is the most important
thing you've ever done.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.795
There's nothing
involved with salt.

03:48.796 --> 03:53.099
I don't have to rub that
into my raw, thick skin.

03:53.100 --> 04:00.473
I'm a broken man.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.342
I seem beneath the shame and

04:02.343 --> 04:04.977
a headache to be missing a few

04:04.978 --> 04:12.118
layers of skin, as if I've
been rubbed somehow raw.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.252
I believe in clean, really,
but this is beyond clean.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.557
This is sanded,
stripped, filleted.

04:17.558 --> 04:21.394
The beer is not helping.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.129
Well, maybe it is.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.332
I think I've had enough.

04:25.333 --> 04:30.470
The gleeful embrace of mixing

04:30.471 --> 04:36.309
whiskey, rice wine,
beer, and oys

04:36.310 --> 04:40.813
oysters, it seems
to tempt the fates.

04:40.814 --> 04:40.981
Ooh.

04:40.982 --> 04:43.249
Ooh.

04:43.250 --> 04:43.984
Yes.

04:43.985 --> 04:45.818
Let me ask you one
more question.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.853
Uh-huh.

04:46.854 --> 04:50.923
What do you think about
Han now after your trip?

04:50.924 --> 04:53.326
I'm brimming with Han.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.495
I mean I could never actually

04:55.496 --> 04:57.764
have a Han because
I'm not that Korean.

04:57.765 --> 05:02.335
This is a genetic
over cellular thing.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.103
I understand.

05:03.104 --> 05:08.341
But it's something I feel
I can really relate to.

05:08.342 --> 05:15.014
I'm definitely a revenge is a

05:15.015 --> 05:17.350
dish best served
cold kind of guy.

05:17.351 --> 05:21.087
You eat a lot of chicken.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.690
You didn't eat all day, did you?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.125
No, I did not love
myself this morning.

05:26.126 --> 05:31.030
But you felt better
after your scrub down?

05:31.031 --> 05:39.031
It was like punish the evil.

05:46.547 --> 05:54.547
♪

06:06.467 --> 06:13.072
This social contract, the
confusion hierarchy of age

06:13.073 --> 06:16.409
before everything, fades away.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.178
We are no longer Mr. Ha, Mr.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.449
Park, Mr. No, and Mr. Tony.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.184
We move as one, a band of bros

06:25.185 --> 06:33.185
through the night, the
world our oyster.

06:39.633 --> 06:47.633
♪

06:49.109 --> 06:56.883
I feel like a boy band.

06:56.884 --> 07:04.884
♪

07:05.959 --> 07:09.896
Johnny cash.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.464
Johnny cash?

07:11.465 --> 07:14.534
Yeah.

07:14.535 --> 07:21.173
Thank god there was no karaoke.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.175
All roads lead to here.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.144
No escape, just embrace.

07:25.145 --> 07:29.749
I'm acutely aware of my role as

07:29.750 --> 07:31.984
big brother, my new friends

07:31.985 --> 07:33.653
looking at me to set an example.

07:33.654 --> 07:37.990
All right, guys.

07:37.991 --> 07:45.991
Let's party.

07:45.999 --> 07:51.170
Nice to meet you.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.905
So correct me if I'm wrong here.

07:52.906 --> 08:00.906
It is dried squid, m&ms,
and mixing your alcohols?

08:01.348 --> 08:08.521
Yeah.

08:08.522 --> 08:16.522
It seemed like a good
idea back at the office.

08:23.036 --> 08:31.036
Next we'll be performing a
medley from "mama Mia."

08:31.545 --> 08:33.279
We got a low score.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.948
We only got 44.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.753
Mouse?

08:40.754 --> 08:46.225
Mouse fish.

08:46.226 --> 08:53.833
Tony?

08:53.834 --> 08:54.635
You got to go somewhere else.

08:54.636 --> 08:56.168
You got to go somewhere else.

08:56.169 --> 09:00.973
Squid treats and m&ms?

09:00.974 --> 09:01.474
Sure.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.243
Makes perfect sense.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.313
In fact, there were oysters
somewhere along the route.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.082
A tale that becomes increasingly

09:10.083 --> 09:16.756
worrying with our
alcohol intake.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.691
Oysters, awesome.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.359
Nice.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.694
Competitive drinking
and shellfish.

09:21.695 --> 09:25.431
Have you ever played in
Korean drinking games?

09:25.432 --> 09:25.933
No.

09:25.934 --> 09:27.667
Well, they have a lot of them.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.301
It keeps the energy up and keeps

09:29.302 --> 09:33.539
everyone kind of drinking.

09:33.540 --> 09:38.010
Stop two.

09:38.011 --> 09:38.545
All right.

09:38.546 --> 09:43.149
We're going to play a
little game first.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.352
Tony, we're going to let
you start the festivities.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.621
You have to use a chop stick,

09:48.622 --> 09:51.791
hit everything forward,
it's going to splash up.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.292
What?

09:52.293 --> 09:56.562
A strike or a push?

09:56.563 --> 10:04.563
A push.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.342
There's a lot of games.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.979
We're not going to go through

10:12.980 --> 10:13.613
them all because it would take

10:13.614 --> 10:15.047
forever and we'd be
really, really drunk.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.150
But this game is called
the bottle cap game.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.385
We're going to pass this around

10:19.386 --> 10:21.320
in a circle and you're going to

10:21.321 --> 10:29.321
flick it as hard as you can.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.402
No one wins or loses.

10:36.403 --> 10:43.509
We all get drunk.

10:43.510 --> 10:43.777
Very good.

10:43.778 --> 10:49.548
That is brotastic.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.451
Okay, this is chop sticking.

10:52.452 --> 10:57.256
Don't play this game
with engineers.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.527
Oh, don't hurt the man.

11:01.528 --> 11:04.731
He's been hitting
those oysters hard.

11:04.732 --> 11:12.732
See you in flavor town.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.875
One, two, and three.

11:15.876 --> 11:20.579
It's pretty good.

11:20.580 --> 11:25.385
That's good.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.387
We got to go somewhere else.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.289
Yeah, we're going.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.292
Let's hit the street, guys.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.996
The idea that only an hour

11:36.997 --> 11:40.432
earlier we sat like
gentlemen and had barbecue.

11:40.433 --> 11:48.433
A rapidly fading memory.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.350
Tony, how many bottles
can you drink?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.252
We'll see.

11:59.253 --> 12:00.586
Yes, I remember now.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.321
Somewhere near the start of the

12:02.322 --> 12:04.924
evening, the moment little

12:04.925 --> 12:06.592
brother grabbed the reins of our

12:06.593 --> 12:11.297
soon to be careening chariot

12:11.298 --> 12:12.698
unfettered by good sense and the

12:12.699 --> 12:15.434
reality of work tomorrow.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.137
Eat the egg, eat the egg

12:18.138 --> 12:19.338
before it gets cooked too much.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.273
That's good.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.041
It's good.

12:21.042 --> 12:22.842
You like the marinated
one, right?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.346
This is being Korea, beer is

12:27.347 --> 12:32.218
a must as is apparently soju.

12:32.219 --> 12:37.356
What seems to define Korea as I

12:37.357 --> 12:41.627
know it is it anticipates
the future very, very well.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.895
This is a country that's famous

12:42.896 --> 12:47.633
for looking forward,
looking into the future.

12:47.634 --> 12:51.804
Where does one go to see Korea's

12:51.805 --> 12:59.805
past, and are these guys
sentimental about it at all?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.336
Younger brother?

13:24.337 --> 13:32.337
All right, younger brother.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.954
My mission for purposes of

13:41.955 --> 13:44.190
television is to ingraciousuate

13:44.191 --> 13:46.926
myself with a total group of

13:46.927 --> 13:48.727
strangers, insinuate myself into

13:48.728 --> 13:54.300
their lives and insert myself

13:54.301 --> 13:56.468
into an expression combining the

13:56.469 --> 13:57.970
concepts of company and meal.

13:57.971 --> 14:01.707
In Korean culture, this
would be a regular thing.

14:01.708 --> 14:05.711
A one night corporate
retreat, if you will.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.713
Which is how I ended up at my

14:07.714 --> 14:10.883
appointment with the fates, a

14:10.884 --> 14:16.488
barbecue joint popular
with the salary man.

14:16.489 --> 14:21.560
How did I end up here?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.329
Mr. Noh.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.897
Tony.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.565
I think they like me.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.434
Do you drink soju?

14:27.435 --> 14:29.402
I do.

14:50.690 --> 14:54.626
This is Anthony Bourdain, CNN.

14:54.627 --> 15:00.467
Good night.

15:01.969 --> 15:07.974
Notice the totally blissed
out happy look an my face.

15:07.975 --> 15:12.111
Observe the bowl with nothing
left but fiery remnants.

15:12.112 --> 15:20.112
Behold the magnificence
that is this dish.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.061
Enough, enough.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.863
That's good.

15:31.864 --> 15:35.301
Geez.

15:35.302 --> 15:35.868
Oh, man.

15:35.869 --> 15:43.869
That's going to go
straight to my hips.

15:45.145 --> 15:45.545
Yes.

15:45.546 --> 15:49.581
Okay, okay.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.717
Thank you.

15:51.718 --> 15:59.718
This is a magical dish.

16:07.867 --> 16:11.270
So most people are not
sentimental about their time in

16:11.271 --> 16:15.041
the military.

16:15.042 --> 16:23.042
Why do this?

16:26.219 --> 16:28.387
Everybody serves in
the military, right?

16:28.388 --> 16:36.388
It's mandatory in Korea.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.564
Very happy.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.299
You want the recipe about this?

16:40.300 --> 16:43.035
I got the recipe now.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.605
It's everything mama warned

16:46.606 --> 16:47.706
you about, and it's got it all,

16:47.707 --> 16:51.110
baby, and when the music is
over, your life will have

16:51.111 --> 16:51.578
changed forever.

16:51.579 --> 16:59.579
One, two, three.

17:03.590 --> 17:07.759
Okay.

17:07.760 --> 17:15.434
Okay.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.136
Yes.

17:16.136 --> 17:16.836
Yeah.

17:16.837 --> 17:19.438
Dating back to famine years of

17:19.439 --> 17:22.941
the Korean war, scrounging from

17:22.942 --> 17:25.844
American military bases, it is a

17:25.845 --> 17:32.118
classic example of necessity
feeding the mother of

17:32.119 --> 17:32.452
deliciousness.

17:32.453 --> 17:36.755
Hot dogs, baked beans, spam, and

17:36.756 --> 17:38.957
noodles put together
with kimchee.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.761
It became an enduring and
deeply loved classic.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.498
Like I used to say to my first

17:46.499 --> 17:54.005
girlfriend, how could something
so wrong be so right.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.975
You got that right.

17:56.976 --> 18:04.976
No, no, no.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.893
Wow!

18:14.894 --> 18:15.195
No.

18:15.196 --> 18:23.196
I tell you.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.807
I'm sorry about that.

18:28.808 --> 18:33.145
Sorry, man.

18:33.146 --> 18:39.985
Regrettable incident.

18:39.986 --> 18:40.687
Looks healthy.

18:40.688 --> 18:42.354
Look at this thing.

18:42.355 --> 18:46.358
Look at the color alone.

18:46.359 --> 18:54.359
In go the noodles.

18:59.206 --> 18:59.739
Wow.

18:59.740 --> 19:00.839
Yeah, baby.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.907
Yeah, baby.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.244
Come to me, come to me, my love.

19:05.245 --> 19:09.548
Yes.

19:09.549 --> 19:13.552
Little spam in there.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.187
Good job, chef.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.722
Good chefs.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.591
Yes, yes, yes.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.227
Thank you.

19:20.228 --> 19:22.861
My pleasure.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.630
Any time.

19:24.631 --> 19:29.968
In a society reeling from
conflict and deprivation,

19:29.969 --> 19:32.037
largely without meat and fresh

19:32.038 --> 19:40.038
ingredients, this was
the gift of the G.I.

19:41.748 --> 19:45.150
The Korean war lasted from 1950

19:45.151 --> 19:50.055
to 1953, but in many
ways it never ended.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.624
The country is split in half and

19:52.625 --> 19:55.461
in a constant state of alert.

19:55.462 --> 19:59.064
120 miles to the north, a crazy

19:59.065 --> 20:01.433
dictator with an army, a bad

20:01.434 --> 20:03.302
haircut, and a nuclear arsenal.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.136
This we know.

20:04.137 --> 20:09.975
But the war divided a country
and divided families.

20:09.976 --> 20:14.580
Altered forever the
Korean character.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.581
The chef's early experience

20:15.582 --> 20:18.484
working the mess hall during his

20:18.485 --> 20:21.453
mandatory military service led

20:21.454 --> 20:23.855
directly to super stardom.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.091
He beams his cooking show live

20:26.092 --> 20:28.294
in more than 50,000 homes today

20:28.295 --> 20:30.962
via something called
the Internet.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.164
And he's not the only one.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.934
There's competition.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.436
Lots of it.

20:37.437 --> 20:41.773
Broadcast eating, it's kind of a

20:41.774 --> 20:45.611
phenomena in Korea, which is how

20:45.612 --> 20:53.612
I wound up in a tent on
the outskirts of Seoul.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.322
Right here?

20:56.323 --> 20:58.023
All right.

20:58.024 --> 20:58.658
Classic indigenous ingredients.

20:58.659 --> 21:00.225
No spam.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.727
Excellent.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.994
Yes.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.964
All right.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.884
It's a slaughterfest.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.986
I've gotten killed like 12

21:27.987 --> 21:29.054
times already today, so I think

21:29.055 --> 21:30.689
I'm going to hang it up.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.991
All right, I'm ready
for some food.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.495
In Korea, the food delivery
system is really good.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.029
Really good.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.500
A whole bunch of food
you can just order.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.702
Order food while you're playing?

21:43.703 --> 21:44.571
Yeah.

21:44.572 --> 21:48.507
PC bomb sounds like a male

21:48.508 --> 21:52.411
porn store, but this
one has a lounge.

21:52.412 --> 21:57.449
Here in Seoul, given that
there's an entire strata of

21:57.450 --> 22:01.052
professional gamers, more

22:01.053 --> 22:03.555
sustainable food is, from
time to time, required.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.123
No problem.

22:04.124 --> 22:08.927
Anything you want right
to your console.

22:08.928 --> 22:13.031
Real-life, does it
have any attraction?

22:13.032 --> 22:14.065
Real life?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.534
You know nongaming world.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.902
People love it.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.937
Professional gamers, people love

22:18.938 --> 22:20.406
the professional gamers.

22:20.407 --> 22:25.210
They get a lot of fame for that.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.244
Right.

22:26.245 --> 22:29.915
Oh, man.

22:29.916 --> 22:30.617
This is too much.

22:30.618 --> 22:33.485
You got to get the
sauce with the noodle.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.220
Yep.

22:34.221 --> 22:36.054
It's a black noodle.

22:36.055 --> 22:36.889
It should be all black.

22:36.889 --> 22:37.824
Tasty.

22:37.824 --> 22:38.591
Good?

22:38.591 --> 22:39.392
That'll work.

22:39.393 --> 22:44.162
Some of the games you can
play while still eating.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.296
One handed?

22:45.297 --> 22:47.399
Basically, you eat a little

22:47.400 --> 22:50.001
bit and then play the game, eat

22:50.002 --> 22:52.070
a little bit, then
play the game.

22:52.071 --> 22:56.442
The only game I've ever really
gotten serious about and

22:56.443 --> 22:57.776
lived with a year... I spent a

22:57.777 --> 23:01.146
lot of time and it
was GTA vice city.

23:01.147 --> 23:04.450
In my opinion, it is a
little bit violent for me.

23:04.451 --> 23:08.687
That's my personal opinion.

23:08.688 --> 23:12.591
Look, there was a lot of
bleeding out in this game.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.493
That's true.

23:14.494 --> 23:17.128
Over the mountain and through

23:17.129 --> 23:18.764
the woods to grandmother's house

23:18.765 --> 23:22.701
we go, blowing some shit up on

23:22.702 --> 23:30.702
the way and was it right
click, left click?

23:31.944 --> 23:32.178
Okay.

23:32.179 --> 23:39.451
I'm looking for the little
guys with the red over them.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.722
Yeah.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.458
That doesn't look good.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.560
Oh, geez.

23:48.561 --> 23:48.961
I'm respawning.

23:48.962 --> 23:51.396
Yeah, respawning.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.164
You could target.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.233
You can pull long distance or

23:55.234 --> 23:59.370
short distance depending
on where your target is.

23:59.371 --> 24:05.844
I'm just learning
how to move here.

24:05.845 --> 24:11.583
Oh, poor little red riding hood.

24:11.584 --> 24:17.656
She's not good.

24:17.657 --> 24:25.657
If I'm shooting
something, it's me.

24:25.898 --> 24:26.699
Oh, no.

24:26.700 --> 24:32.504
Little red riding hood,
you're bleeding out again.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.372
Oops.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.741
Didn't make it.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.110
I don't see any bad guys.

24:39.111 --> 24:47.111
Are these friends?

24:47.687 --> 24:51.222
Oops.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.559
Back in the old days before

24:53.560 --> 24:55.426
time itself, spending 17 hours a

24:55.427 --> 24:58.764
day at places like this was
frowned upon by family.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.400
Now gaming has become a
respected and often lucrative

25:02.401 --> 25:04.903
profession in Korea.

25:04.904 --> 25:08.574
Simon has pretty much retired
from gaming, per Se.

25:08.575 --> 25:12.611
Instead he makes a living
advising rising stars in the

25:12.612 --> 25:12.912
industry.

25:12.913 --> 25:14.445
You do this for a living?

25:14.446 --> 25:14.814
Yeah.

25:14.815 --> 25:16.247
How many hours a day?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.049
The professional gamers, they

25:18.050 --> 25:20.819
spend all day playing this game.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.188
They wake up, play
a game, practice.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.256
Have lunch, practice again, have

25:25.257 --> 25:27.258
dinner, and go to sleep.

25:27.259 --> 25:32.063
Today the game is one of
those multiplayer kill fests

25:32.064 --> 25:40.064
where mighty avatar post
a range of abilities.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.473
There we go.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.075
This is all about love.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.110
Really cute.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.678
Little girl.

25:46.679 --> 25:50.315
That's me?

25:50.316 --> 25:53.418
Oh, geez.

25:53.419 --> 25:56.988
Can we choose another
avatar maybe?

25:56.989 --> 25:59.424
Something more killy?

25:59.425 --> 26:01.126
I don't know if I'm going to

26:01.127 --> 26:06.832
strike fear into my enemies.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.533
Little girl comes around the

26:08.534 --> 26:11.169
corner having a big
fireball on your head.

26:11.170 --> 26:14.806
I'll try to keep up with
you for a few minutes.

26:14.807 --> 26:21.546
Press W to go forward and
press right and left clicked

26:21.547 --> 26:21.814
together.

26:21.815 --> 26:23.615
Right key on the mouse.

26:23.616 --> 26:27.152
Forward is W.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.219
Yeah.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.488
E shift and left together.

26:30.489 --> 26:34.025
Shift and then...
Left together, yeah.

26:34.026 --> 26:38.496
Then space, right click, left

26:38.497 --> 26:39.998
shift with left click together.

26:39.999 --> 26:40.900
Brutal.

26:40.901 --> 26:42.634
How long did it take you to

26:42.635 --> 26:46.037
figure out how to move
around in this world?

26:46.038 --> 26:47.138
About ten minutes.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.175
Ten minutes, yeah.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.511
Okay, me and Simon are going

26:53.512 --> 26:56.014
up against these kids and I'm

26:56.015 --> 27:01.319
expecting to pistol whip some

27:01.320 --> 27:07.726
bitches unless time has
once again passed me by.

27:07.727 --> 27:12.530
The life of a professional video

27:12.531 --> 27:14.766
gamer is a concept that's
not easy for me to grasp.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.868
These young nerd
lingers are famous.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.236
They have TV shows where they

27:18.237 --> 27:20.505
compete and are making
actual cash money.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.108
They have sponsors
and super fans.

27:23.109 --> 27:27.245
They probably even get
laid off this shit?

27:27.246 --> 27:29.280
And that explains how little red

27:29.281 --> 27:31.616
riding hood ended up bleeding

27:31.617 --> 27:35.020
out on the cold,
hard, virtual floor.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.255
Should we start the game?

27:37.256 --> 27:38.556
Sure.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.526
Okay, where's our opponents?

27:50.236 --> 27:52.138
I'm going to fire your ass.

27:52.471 --> 27:56.942
Don't say anything
about Wayne Newton.

27:56.943 --> 27:59.544
He's the man.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.412
He's early 90s west coast.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.749
I'm a west coast guy.

28:03.750 --> 28:07.452
I'm not entirely convinced
that Korean food is healthy.

28:07.453 --> 28:11.757
Have you always been a food guy?

28:11.758 --> 28:14.459
I'm very happy here.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.227
Last one?

28:16.228 --> 28:16.896
Yeah.

28:16.897 --> 28:18.329
Is this drinks that goes with

28:18.330 --> 28:20.932
food or is this food
that goes with drinks?

28:20.933 --> 28:26.271
The culture is you have to

28:26.272 --> 28:28.273
have something that goes
well with that drink.

28:28.274 --> 28:32.010
We should probably be
drinking that, right?

28:32.011 --> 28:34.946
Yes.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.349
Have you had soju before?

28:38.350 --> 28:42.287
How often can you come to
a place like this a week?

28:42.288 --> 28:49.294
Would you come every day?

28:49.295 --> 28:51.162
Sure.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.765
I like to recommend
the soup of death.

28:53.766 --> 28:58.469
It's a soup, but the main
ingredient in that is silk

28:58.470 --> 28:58.805
worms.

28:58.805 --> 28:59.305
That okay?

28:59.306 --> 29:03.708
Yeah, sure.

29:03.709 --> 29:03.943
Oh.

29:03.943 --> 29:04.510
Nice?

29:04.511 --> 29:06.011
Oh, yeah.

29:06.012 --> 29:10.982
Eating bugs, that
is so last network.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.483
How do you like the soup?

29:12.484 --> 29:13.684
The soup is awesome.

29:13.685 --> 29:21.685
I'm going to go home and
have Benisans tonight.

29:24.230 --> 29:29.000
Get the [ Muted ] out of my
soup and make me a sweater.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.836
Even Koreans don't eat this

29:30.837 --> 29:32.503
all the time, but I guess this

29:32.504 --> 29:34.572
country makes you feel like if

29:34.573 --> 29:37.876
you can't eat this,
then you're not Korean.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.846
What were you born?

29:40.847 --> 29:41.213
In New York.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.081
In New York.

29:42.081 --> 29:42.581
Yes.

29:42.582 --> 29:46.184
And were there until
until roughly 21.

29:46.185 --> 29:53.391
I grew up on the streets
and new York city.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.561
It was automatically
you're a chink.

29:56.562 --> 30:01.032
I'm Korean and I'm
proud to be Korean.

30:01.033 --> 30:05.770
Mark is what's called a
Korean who has lived abroad.

30:05.771 --> 30:08.539
More and more people are, like

30:08.540 --> 30:12.410
Mark, moving back home for
the ever more numerous

30:12.411 --> 30:12.744
opportunities.

30:12.745 --> 30:16.181
When I came here, it
just felt right for me.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.016
I'm here.

30:17.017 --> 30:19.517
These are my peoples.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.187
This has what I've been missing.

30:22.188 --> 30:25.123
I was considered an
outsider in my own country.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.758
I had like this thing going on

30:27.759 --> 30:32.230
because I was like am I not
Korean enough if I don't do

30:32.231 --> 30:34.132
this, if I don't drink this, if

30:34.133 --> 30:35.400
I don't eat this, but there was

30:35.401 --> 30:37.435
a sense of I want to learn this

30:37.436 --> 30:42.473
if that makes me
feel more Korean.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.109
Nice.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.744
Is this so hard to walk in and

30:46.745 --> 30:49.447
eat delicious food and get
hammered in the street?

30:49.448 --> 30:52.250
Being Korean is pretty awesome.

30:52.251 --> 30:56.254
Last one.

30:56.255 --> 31:02.928
Yeah.

31:02.929 --> 31:08.299
Nighttime in Seoul and
everywhere you go it seems, food

31:08.300 --> 31:09.434
and drink.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.069
This is what they call kind of

31:11.070 --> 31:15.806
like a pub, if pubs could
operate in the street.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.309
You can have drinks, and well, I

31:18.310 --> 31:21.512
guess you could
call it, pub food.

31:21.513 --> 31:26.151
We're about to go eat
some really, really good.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.519
Welcome to Seoul.

31:28.520 --> 31:28.854
Let's do this.

31:28.855 --> 31:33.691
My new friend Mark helped

31:33.692 --> 31:38.296
popularize western style
hip hop in Korea.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.933
An event that led me to
eating silk worms in a tent.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.902
So where are we?

31:51.677 --> 31:54.145
Do I have the position correct?

31:54.146 --> 31:56.881
Are you complaining
about your hours?

31:56.882 --> 32:01.552
Number one selling liquor
in the whole world.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.655
Prostitutes so many times.

32:04.656 --> 32:07.692
Get many my mouth
and stay there.

32:07.693 --> 32:11.829
She's already dead.

32:11.830 --> 32:19.830
Come on.

32:20.973 --> 32:25.410
I'm getting this weird
sense of deja vu.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.012
Haven't we been in a fish market

32:27.013 --> 32:28.546
in Seoul at some point?

32:28.547 --> 32:33.518
Maybe a slight... what should
we toast to this time?

32:33.519 --> 32:41.519
To a triumphant return to Korea?

32:42.328 --> 32:47.198
There's something I've been
craving since I got off the

32:47.199 --> 32:47.533
plane.

32:47.534 --> 32:51.936
The snacks that accompany
your meal in Korea.

32:51.937 --> 32:57.242
This is one of the most
exciting things about Korean

32:57.243 --> 32:57.743
food.

32:57.744 --> 33:01.579
Doesn't that make you
want to drink more soju?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.049
Is that a hint or something?

33:04.050 --> 33:08.086
I know the formality of it all.

33:08.087 --> 33:11.922
The appetizers, yes, I
remember these guys.

33:11.923 --> 33:16.794
Bringing back memories.

33:16.795 --> 33:20.531
Here we go.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.733
So this is spicy stew.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.602
I need it to burn.

33:24.603 --> 33:29.774
It has everything under
the sun seafood wise.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.877
You can find crab,
all kinds of fish.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.113
Fishermen stews all
over the world.

33:35.114 --> 33:35.881
Exactly.

33:35.882 --> 33:38.483
This bowl for me, that's the

33:38.484 --> 33:40.985
perfect example of
Koreans in general.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.253
We love being together in a

33:42.254 --> 33:48.726
space, huddled around a
bubbling pot of something.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.428
This is good.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.798
You are failing your duties
as a young assistant.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.102
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:57.103 --> 34:01.506
We don't have to drink
it immediately, do we?

34:01.507 --> 34:04.342
Face planting.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.611
Koreans, they just want each

34:06.612 --> 34:09.246
other to drink as
much as possible.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.617
Peer pressure drinking
is kind of a big deal.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.152
May I have another glass please?

34:15.154 --> 34:19.657
Korean drinking etiquette 101.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.792
You never pour your own drink.

34:21.793 --> 34:26.130
Younger pours for the older
and you never drink alone.

34:26.132 --> 34:31.969
How come all the Korean
guys are so tormented?

34:31.969 --> 34:35.840
They're carrying around
an unseen weight.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.476
Every single Korean person is

34:38.476 --> 34:40.777
born with this thing called Han,

34:40.779 --> 34:43.481
which is a deep
sorrow and anger.

34:43.482 --> 34:47.985
It has nothing to do with your

34:51.489 --> 34:51.822
upbringing.

34:51.824 --> 34:53.056
Han, my favorite Korean word.

34:53.058 --> 34:55.326
Generally speaking, it is a

34:55.327 --> 34:58.196
mixture of endurance, yearning,

34:58.197 --> 35:02.333
sorrow, regret, bitterness,

35:02.334 --> 35:05.803
spite, hatred, and to bide your

35:05.804 --> 35:10.175
time until revenge can
at last be exacted.

35:10.176 --> 35:14.212
Revenge is a very, very sweet

35:14.213 --> 35:18.749
tasting thing for Koreans
because there's been so much

35:18.750 --> 35:19.351
wrong that's happened to us.

35:19.352 --> 35:21.419
What about little Timmy

35:21.420 --> 35:28.025
master who is made fun
of you in second grade?

35:28.026 --> 35:32.197
Is there vengeance
coming their way?

35:32.198 --> 35:38.569
I want them to actually
love Korean food now.

35:38.570 --> 35:42.039
Doesn't sound anywhere close
to personal suffering.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.010
Well, that's my personal story.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.045
I would think electric
nipple clamps.

35:48.046 --> 35:53.184
They slowly bled the
reason that Koreans are

35:53.185 --> 35:54.919
able to just not wallow in that

35:54.920 --> 36:01.058
is because of this other
emotion called Chung.

36:01.059 --> 36:04.128
It is a deep fondness that you

36:04.129 --> 36:06.264
have for your other Koreans, and

36:06.265 --> 36:09.033
people all focus on Haun and I

36:09.034 --> 36:11.769
know, like, Haun, yes,
yes, yes, it exists.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.137
No one is denying that.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.640
We all have it.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.041
But Chung, no one talks about

36:17.042 --> 36:19.244
that and it's equally strong.

36:19.245 --> 36:19.745
Okay.

36:19.746 --> 36:21.546
I believe you.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.381
I don't think you believe
me about this Chung thing.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.915
No, I believe you.

36:24.916 --> 36:28.152
Like I like the
whole idea of Han.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.987
I totally get that as an engine.

36:29.988 --> 36:30.756
I like that.

36:30.757 --> 36:32.590
I like that dark side.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.492
The fact that this word exists

36:34.493 --> 36:37.595
is sort of awesome because a
negative emotion has been

36:37.596 --> 36:41.599
converted into a number of
very, very, very positive

36:41.600 --> 36:41.933
developments.

36:41.934 --> 36:42.934
Absolutely.

36:42.935 --> 36:45.570
Koreans are, you know, this

36:45.571 --> 36:46.904
amazing group of people that

36:46.905 --> 36:48.172
don't curse and eat amazing

36:48.173 --> 36:50.275
food, and we like to
drink and have fun.

36:50.276 --> 36:54.612
Oh, stop sucking up.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.746
So, to the Han.

36:55.747 --> 37:00.685
We need to make a serious toast.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.086
We're you a nuclear and amazing.

37:02.087 --> 37:02.821
That describes me.

37:02.822 --> 37:03.921
I'm not drinking this.

37:03.922 --> 37:11.922
No, you don't have to drink it.

37:12.798 --> 37:17.335
My relentlessly cheerful
friend and colleague Nari.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.136
She loves Korea and all things

37:19.137 --> 37:20.505
Korea and wants nothing more

37:20.506 --> 37:23.808
than to make everybody love
it as much as she does.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.810
That's why she brought me here

37:25.811 --> 37:28.946
to the Garak fish market where

37:28.947 --> 37:31.482
you find the kinds of
casual joints that I love.

37:31.483 --> 37:35.320
I will have, let me
see, perhaps the fish.

37:35.321 --> 37:38.523
I want some enchana and spicy

37:38.524 --> 37:41.492
stuff and we'll start
off by drinking.

37:41.493 --> 37:41.727
Yes.

37:41.728 --> 37:44.061
I'm getting a weird
sense of deja vu.

37:44.062 --> 37:47.965
Like haven't we been at
a fish market in Seoul.

37:47.966 --> 37:48.834
Walk down memory Lane.

37:48.835 --> 37:50.802
At some previous life.

38:02.414 --> 38:05.015
The past, the
present, the future.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.184
In Korea they all
bleed together.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.186
If you're there for the whole

38:09.187 --> 38:11.188
ride, one explains the other.

38:11.189 --> 38:19.189
Drop in in the middle, and
it makes no sense at all.

38:26.872 --> 38:29.006
Korean culture, as far as I can

38:29.007 --> 38:33.344
tell, is defined by the drive to

38:33.345 --> 38:37.748
succeed, a churning engine
fueled by decades of Han, a

38:37.749 --> 38:42.052
remarkable ability and
remarkable willingness to

38:42.053 --> 38:42.721
anticipate the future.

38:42.722 --> 38:48.393
It reaches back across time
and binding millennials and

38:48.394 --> 38:54.632
generations long since passed.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.734
Last time I was here I was

38:56.735 --> 38:57.868
working for another channel, the

38:57.869 --> 38:59.069
bacon channel, the competitive

38:59.070 --> 39:03.073
eating channel, what was
that old show called?

39:03.074 --> 39:04.042
It was so long ago.

39:04.043 --> 39:06.377
Back then I was dragged around

39:06.378 --> 39:11.248
in Nari's powerful
wake, as I recall.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.618
That was nearly a decade ago.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.319
Things have changed since then.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.722
I've changed and I'm guessing

39:17.723 --> 39:23.961
Nari's changed, and Korea,
Korea has certainly changed.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.295
The Korean war ended more than

39:25.296 --> 39:29.467
half a century ago, but in
some ways it's still going.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.502
The north and south have been on

39:31.503 --> 39:33.938
perpetual war
footing ever since.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.141
It's a psychological
and physical scar.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.077
Korea is literally split in

39:40.078 --> 39:45.650
half, but that's not
what this show is about.

39:45.651 --> 39:46.751
There aren't many comparisons to

39:46.752 --> 39:49.587
South Korea's stratospheric
rise over the last decade.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.088
One of the poorest countries as

39:51.089 --> 39:55.292
recently as '60s, today it
claims one of the world's

39:55.293 --> 39:57.294
fastest growing economies.

39:57.295 --> 40:00.698
The government has been
extremely shrewd and forward

40:00.699 --> 40:02.433
thinking about selling the world

40:02.434 --> 40:05.335
all things Korean, underwriting,

40:05.336 --> 40:08.939
encouraging, financing and
supporting the export of

40:08.940 --> 40:11.942
intangibles, things like music,

40:11.943 --> 40:14.211
movies, TV show, food, the whole

40:14.212 --> 40:16.781
Korean sensibility, and the

40:16.782 --> 40:18.649
world is responding, learning to

40:18.650 --> 40:22.453
love what Koreans
have always loved.

40:22.454 --> 40:26.491
The heart of Korea is Seoul,
capital city, a bustling

40:26.492 --> 40:27.492
Metropolis.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.827
Futuristic in look
and character.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.896
Population 25 million.

40:31.897 --> 40:32.831
Look at that.

40:32.832 --> 40:36.233
They have a selfie stick.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.669
Everybody is taking
pictures of their food.

40:38.670 --> 40:39.904
They feel right at home.

40:39.905 --> 40:44.842
In October 2014 I
went back to Korea.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.844
This is what I saw.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.180
This makes me so happy.

40:50.181 --> 40:54.418
The kimchi, make room
for the noodles.

40:54.419 --> 40:56.654
Oh, that's good.

40:56.655 --> 41:00.024
Should be no surprise that
I'm in a happy place now.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.892
Oh, yeah.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.494
First night back.

41:03.495 --> 41:04.562
Back to the market.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.898
Unrecognizable and
invariably and inevitably

41:07.899 --> 41:13.538
delicious food.

41:13.539 --> 41:16.975
Good to be back, man,
good to be back.
