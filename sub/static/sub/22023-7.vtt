WEBVTT

00:03.383 --> 00:05.351
Uh-uh, nope, not gonna happen.

00:05.385 --> 00:07.686
Hey. Dina, is something wrong?

00:07.721 --> 00:09.622
You know the rules.
No religious crap in the store.

00:09.656 --> 00:11.757
Religious cr... Oh, this?

00:11.791 --> 00:15.060
This is just a winter barn display.

00:15.095 --> 00:16.528
With a Baby Jesus and Three Wise Men?

00:16.563 --> 00:18.731
That is a normal barn baby

00:18.765 --> 00:21.367
and three men of average intelligence.

00:22.058 --> 00:23.435
No, below average.

00:24.125 --> 00:24.703
No, average.

00:24.738 --> 00:27.640
Oh, wow. Well, I feel foolish.

00:27.674 --> 00:29.408
It's an honest mistake.

00:30.087 --> 00:31.110
I can't believe that I thought

00:31.144 --> 00:32.543
this guy was a wise man.

00:32.579 --> 00:35.402
What a stupid, stupid dummy I am.

00:35.497 --> 00:36.649
You're not that stupid.

00:36.683 --> 00:39.385
I mean, I guess if this was
someone from the Bible,

00:39.419 --> 00:42.087
you'd probably be pretty
upset if I did this.

00:45.592 --> 00:48.047
- Yeah, I probably would be.
- Probably would be, yeah.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.396
And I-I guess then you'd also
be upset if I did this.

00:51.264 --> 00:52.564
Oh!

00:52.599 --> 00:54.566
His head popped off.

00:54.601 --> 00:56.435
It's so much fun kicking them.

00:56.469 --> 00:58.137
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

00:58.171 --> 01:00.172
Guess that brings us
to this little gentleman.

01:00.206 --> 01:01.005
Okay, could you just...

01:01.006 --> 01:02.741
Born with a simple destiny...

01:02.776 --> 01:05.310
to be punted across a Cloud 9 store.

01:05.345 --> 01:08.747
She... could... go... all... the... way!

01:08.782 --> 01:10.816
Wait, give me that! That's Baby Jesus!

01:10.850 --> 01:12.751
That is sweet little Baby Jesus!

01:12.786 --> 01:15.254
You leave him alone, you monster!

01:15.288 --> 01:17.256
They're all dolls, Glenn.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:27.534 --> 01:30.869
Come on, I don't know if
it's a bulb or a stripped wire.

01:30.904 --> 01:32.371
Glenn, you've been trying

01:32.405 --> 01:33.772
for two months to solve this problem.

01:33.807 --> 01:35.140
I really don't think
you're gonna crack it

01:35.175 --> 01:36.298
on Christmas Eve.

01:36.299 --> 01:37.916
My grandmother would
kill me for saying this,

01:37.917 --> 01:40.871
but I just don't get why people
make such a big deal out of Christmas.

01:40.872 --> 01:42.245
- What?
- I mean, real talk...

01:42.246 --> 01:44.216
Christmas is pretty
disappointing and overhyped.

01:44.218 --> 01:45.680
- It's kind of like "Star Wars."
- Whoa!

01:45.681 --> 01:47.449
- You don't like "Star Wars"?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:47.450 --> 01:50.189
Can we just one-at-a-time this?

01:50.223 --> 01:51.290
It's not about a day.

01:51.324 --> 01:52.620
It's about looking back

01:52.621 --> 01:54.827
on the year we shared
and celebrating it.

01:54.861 --> 01:57.196
Yeah, let's celebrate the
year a tornado hit the store.

01:57.230 --> 01:58.864
My entire apartment got destroyed.

01:58.898 --> 02:00.532
I got a really annoying roommate,

02:00.567 --> 02:02.701
- and he won't leave.
- I got a divorce.

02:02.736 --> 02:04.450
My boyfriend wound up in a coma.

02:04.451 --> 02:07.239
- I am looking for a place.
- Not looking hard enough.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.459
- It's just a sucky year.
- The doctors aren't sure

02:09.460 --> 02:10.809
- if he'll ever even...
- Cheyenne, can I have

02:10.844 --> 02:13.345
- the voltage tester, please?
- But I do have to say

02:13.379 --> 02:15.147
I'm looking forward to next year.

02:15.181 --> 02:18.417
I really feel like it's time
to just start living life.

02:18.451 --> 02:20.185
You know? Like, I don't know.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.821
- I feel like I can get wilder.
- Oh, God.

02:22.856 --> 02:24.323
You're not gonna cut
your hair again, are you?

02:24.357 --> 02:26.325
No. I mean, maybe.

02:26.359 --> 02:28.660
I don't know. I just mean, like...

02:28.695 --> 02:31.263
finally taking those motorcycle lessons,

02:31.297 --> 02:32.865
or skydiving, or, like,

02:32.899 --> 02:35.334
maybe I'll get a tattoo.

02:35.368 --> 02:38.170
Okay. Okay.

02:38.204 --> 02:40.172
There's just no way
you're doing any of that.

02:40.206 --> 02:44.126
I'm serious. I-I'm going to
unleash crazy Amy.

02:44.889 --> 02:47.946
- You guys can call me "Craymie."
- Uh, no, thanks.

02:47.981 --> 02:49.782
- Cray...
- Not doing that.

02:49.816 --> 02:51.683
- Amy, Craymie.
- Mm-hmm.

02:51.718 --> 02:53.719
All right, well, that was just a idea.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.150
Feels forced.

03:05.398 --> 03:06.765
Oh, dear God, it's cold out here.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.367
You're telling me.

03:08.401 --> 03:10.536
Well, it's, uh, toasty inside,

03:10.570 --> 03:12.437
and you're not really getting
any foot traffic anyway.

03:12.472 --> 03:15.274
So would you mind
stepping away from the door?

03:15.308 --> 03:16.875
- I'm sorry?
- You keep activating

03:16.910 --> 03:18.710
the automatic doors
and letting the heat out.

03:18.745 --> 03:21.380
Also, the bell ringing...
could you slow it down?

03:21.421 --> 03:24.346
Right now you're at a bell,
two, three, four.

03:24.347 --> 03:25.651
Why don't you try a bell...

03:26.533 --> 03:26.885
two...

03:27.764 --> 03:29.421
three... four?

03:29.828 --> 03:32.571
I only ask you because
it's... it's just so annoying.

03:33.459 --> 03:35.244
- Okay.
- Thanks.

03:36.192 --> 03:37.457
Who's a good boy?

03:38.598 --> 03:42.568
I think I saw the raccoon
feces somewhere around...

03:42.602 --> 03:46.405
Oh! Did someone leave hot cocoa

03:46.439 --> 03:49.508
in the middle of the store...

03:49.542 --> 03:52.411
with double the amount of cocoa powder?

03:52.872 --> 03:54.479
It's so Christmas, huh?

03:54.514 --> 03:56.102
Listen, Glenn, I know
what you're trying to do.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.483
But I'm actually trying to
limit my carbs right now.

03:58.518 --> 04:00.619
- So just...
- Just try it.

04:00.653 --> 04:02.354
- No, I don't want to.
- Try the cocoa.

04:02.388 --> 04:03.789
- No.
- It's from Santa Claus.

04:03.823 --> 04:06.173
- Glenn.
- Okay, fine. I'll go first.

04:09.050 --> 04:11.630
It's actually scalding hot,
so maybe give it a minute.

04:16.803 --> 04:18.437
Oh, great.

04:18.471 --> 04:20.839
- Narc alert.
- Oh, it's the fun police.

04:20.874 --> 04:22.708
- Time to get written up.
- Mm-hmm.

04:22.742 --> 04:25.075
Why would you just assume
I'm gonna turn you in?

04:25.076 --> 04:26.311
I mean, it's nothing personal, but...

04:26.346 --> 04:28.347
Yeah, you just always
act all lame and stuff.

04:28.381 --> 04:30.166
- Like a narc.
- Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

04:30.167 --> 04:31.483
I don't understand

04:31.517 --> 04:34.234
why everyone thinks
I'm this little boring...

04:34.721 --> 04:36.735
All right, well, would a narc do this?

04:39.622 --> 04:41.693
That was the tiniest sip I've ever seen.

04:41.728 --> 04:43.328
It feels like what a narc would do

04:43.363 --> 04:44.663
- to prove they're not a narc.
- Yeah.

04:44.697 --> 04:46.832
Okay, well, how about this?

04:50.546 --> 04:52.892
I mean, now you're just
stealing my alcohol.

04:53.539 --> 04:54.171
Ugh.

04:54.941 --> 04:58.043
Oh, hey, man. Merry Christmas.

04:58.451 --> 05:00.119
Oh, wow. Thank you, Garrett.

05:01.094 --> 05:03.415
This is...

05:03.449 --> 05:06.385
I know things have been
a little tense lately.

05:06.419 --> 05:08.820
And I guess, you know,
when you work with someone

05:08.855 --> 05:11.209
you also live with,
things can be a little...

05:11.724 --> 05:13.912
Oh, is that a... is this a bath mat?

05:14.092 --> 05:16.662
Yeah, I just figured it'd be
something you could use

05:16.696 --> 05:18.864
based on the puddles by the shower.

05:18.898 --> 05:22.534
- Well, this is awesome.
- Yeah, right?

05:22.568 --> 05:24.036
Thank you.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.938
You know, I haven't
bought your gift yet.

05:25.972 --> 05:28.073
- Oh, not necessary.
- But I was thinking, you know,

05:28.107 --> 05:29.675
what about noise-canceling headphones?

05:29.709 --> 05:31.076
You know? So you don't... you don't have

05:31.110 --> 05:33.851
to keep banging on the wall
every time I make the tiniest peep.

05:33.852 --> 05:35.717
Or you could save some money

05:35.718 --> 05:38.713
and just quit it with the
harmonica lessons on YouTube.

05:38.752 --> 05:40.919
- That would be a gift.
- Ha! Yeah.

05:40.954 --> 05:43.236
- Yeah, it would be.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.556
- Oh, it could be.
- Uh-huh.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.091
- It could be.
- Yeah.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.527
- Ah, anyway, good talk.
- Oh, great talk.

05:48.561 --> 05:50.429
- Incredible talk.
- Marvelous talk.

05:50.463 --> 05:52.764
Awesome talk. I'm out of earshot.

05:52.799 --> 05:55.033
And then another time,
I thought Jerry came

05:55.068 --> 05:57.123
out of his coma and winked at me,

05:57.503 --> 06:01.373
but turns out, it was just a
muscle spasm from low folic acid.

06:01.812 --> 06:02.975
- Uh-huh.
- Did you check the twitch

06:03.009 --> 06:04.543
for Morse Code?
He could have been telling you

06:04.577 --> 06:06.878
to stop talking, or it's possible

06:06.913 --> 06:08.613
he's in so much pain,
he's just begging anyone

06:08.648 --> 06:10.415
to pull the plug.
I think that's what it was.

06:10.450 --> 06:13.652
Yo, yo, yo. Cheer up, losers!

06:13.686 --> 06:16.888
- It's Christmas!
- What are you doing?

06:16.923 --> 06:20.092
- Turning this into a par-tay.
- Uh-oh!

06:20.126 --> 06:21.927
- Oh!
- Yeah!

06:21.961 --> 06:24.226
- I have ecstasy in my car.
- We'll start here

06:24.227 --> 06:25.797
and then see where the day takes us.

06:25.832 --> 06:28.667
Spread the word, bitches.
Craymie in the house!

06:28.701 --> 06:31.570
Yeah, go, Creamy! Go, Creamy!

06:31.604 --> 06:33.739
Creamy is here!

06:33.773 --> 06:37.042
- Who's Creamy?
- I don't... uh...

06:38.393 --> 06:39.111
I don't know.

06:51.031 --> 06:52.232
- Oh!
- Yes!

06:54.311 --> 06:55.744
All right, listen, it is dangerously

06:55.779 --> 06:58.134
cold out here, and I cannot turn

06:58.135 --> 07:00.227
a blind eye to this, not on Christmas.

07:00.618 --> 07:02.207
- Thank you.
- Come on, little buddy.

07:02.208 --> 07:03.560
You'll be warm inside.

07:03.587 --> 07:07.756
Bell... two..three... four.

07:07.791 --> 07:09.792
You just didn't know me before.

07:09.826 --> 07:13.295
Like, before I was married,
when I was in high school,

07:13.330 --> 07:15.242
I was... wild.

07:16.633 --> 07:20.336
Uh, I was, you guys. I was a teen mom.

07:20.370 --> 07:23.075
- Yeah, but weren't you 19?
- Still a teen.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.999
In some countries,
that's considered late.

07:25.038 --> 07:26.094
Angola, for instance.

07:26.095 --> 07:29.041
Okay, well, we're not
in stupid Angola, Marcus.

07:29.076 --> 07:30.876
Uh, good, 'cause you wouldn't last

07:30.911 --> 07:33.112
- five minutes there.
- No, you guys, I'm serious.

07:33.146 --> 07:35.281
I used to, like, shoplift bulk candy

07:35.315 --> 07:38.351
and, like, run, and one
time I stole a car.

07:38.385 --> 07:40.953
Yeah.

07:40.988 --> 07:42.670
- Okay.
- No, you guys, I did.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.198
It was 10th grade.

07:44.758 --> 07:46.726
I took my math teacher's Kia,

07:46.760 --> 07:49.895
drove it to the Burger King,
got some French toast sticks,

07:49.930 --> 07:52.064
and then I just left it there...
like, bounced.

07:52.603 --> 07:54.511
The French toast sticks
were a little too specific.

07:54.512 --> 07:55.334
But nice try.

07:55.369 --> 07:57.370
Yeah, you would never do that.

07:57.404 --> 07:59.258
No, I did do that.

07:59.259 --> 08:00.537
You know what? I could call Adam.

08:00.538 --> 08:01.674
He'll tell you the whole story.

08:01.708 --> 08:02.875
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

08:02.909 --> 08:06.078
- Call him.
- Okay. I will.

08:06.113 --> 08:09.237
And then we'll see who's crazy.

08:09.616 --> 08:11.584
I had a ton of friends in high school.

08:11.618 --> 08:13.152
It was awesome.

08:13.186 --> 08:15.354
<i>- Amy?
- Adam, hi.</i>

08:15.389 --> 08:17.657
Yeah, it's Amy. Um, okay, so...

08:17.691 --> 08:19.859
tell everyone about that
one... do you remember...

08:19.893 --> 08:22.094
<i>- Start a fire, or...
- Shh, shh.</i>

08:22.129 --> 08:24.830
- Who was that?
<i>- Uh, that's, uh...</i>

08:24.865 --> 08:27.511
<i>That's Bridgett. Emma's
friend Crystal's mom.</i>

08:27.512 --> 08:30.036
Wait, Crystal's over?
I thought Emma was away.

08:30.070 --> 08:33.405
<i>No, I'm at her place.
Um, what did you want?</i>

08:36.043 --> 08:37.876
Nothing. Merry Christmas.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.881
Ha ha. Chickened out.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.250
Couldn't even ask about the car.

08:45.719 --> 08:46.336
Boom!

08:46.337 --> 08:49.255
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Ugh!

08:56.296 --> 08:57.897
You see all the dirt, grime, and gum?

08:57.931 --> 08:59.799
That gets on the bottom of your shoes,

08:59.833 --> 09:01.653
and then you put your shoes on my couch.

09:01.654 --> 09:04.437
Which is why I lay my
shoes on their side

09:04.471 --> 09:06.728
so that the soles don't
touch the fabric.

09:06.729 --> 09:08.441
Oh, you know, I think
you're working too hard.

09:08.475 --> 09:10.209
Why don't you just take off your shoes?

09:10.243 --> 09:11.811
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, guys?

09:11.845 --> 09:13.312
There's a dad here with his kid,

09:13.346 --> 09:15.243
asking where the store Santa is.

09:15.377 --> 09:16.816
Tell him to check the drunk tank.

09:16.850 --> 09:19.575
Apparently Santa's Christmas
cheer level was at a .08.

09:19.576 --> 09:22.054
Maybe Santa has to drink
because Mrs. Claus

09:22.089 --> 09:24.056
won't get off his back
about shoes on the couch.

09:24.091 --> 09:25.725
Call me Mrs. Claus one more time.

09:25.759 --> 09:28.268
Guys, they drove an hour to get here.

09:31.331 --> 09:34.066
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

09:34.101 --> 09:36.667
Merry Christmas from me, too.
I'm an elf.

09:38.205 --> 09:40.773
Well, I've come up with my
New Year's resolutions...

09:40.807 --> 09:42.842
more birds, more sex, more Judo.

09:42.876 --> 09:44.977
And I'm gonna try to
pepper, "Yas, queen,"

09:45.011 --> 09:47.146
into conversation more...
I think it's time.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.390
We're checking out that skank

09:48.391 --> 09:50.041
that Amy's ex-husband is sleeping with.

09:50.042 --> 09:53.352
No, uh-uh. We don't know
that they're sleeping together.

09:53.386 --> 09:55.921
There's a lot of reasons he
could be at that skank's house.

09:55.956 --> 09:58.457
- Oh, there she is.
- Mmm.

09:58.492 --> 10:00.993
Always, like, lurking around,

10:01.027 --> 10:03.195
waiting for a dad to come on the market.

10:03.230 --> 10:05.018
Yeah, she's so...

10:06.515 --> 10:08.013
Basic.

10:08.014 --> 10:09.540
Adam got with that?

10:10.070 --> 10:12.171
Guy's fighting above his weight class.

10:12.205 --> 10:13.222
Good for him.

10:22.516 --> 10:24.383
I've never done it before,

10:24.417 --> 10:26.852
but I could use triple the powder.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.854
Glenn, it's not like
I hate Christmas or anything.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.389
- It's fine.
- "Fine"?

10:30.423 --> 10:33.966
So "Winter Wonderland" is okay, and...

10:35.729 --> 10:37.697
You want to see what
Christmas is all about?

10:37.864 --> 10:39.865
- Come here.
- Glenn...

10:39.900 --> 10:40.740
Excuse me.

10:41.612 --> 10:44.069
You seem to have been
bitten by the Christmas bug.

10:44.104 --> 10:46.305
Sorry, we're making up for lost time.

10:46.339 --> 10:47.907
Oh, no, no, no. Kiss away.

10:47.941 --> 10:50.910
It must be Christmas moments like this

10:50.944 --> 10:52.978
that get you through your next tour.

10:53.013 --> 10:55.247
Oh, there won't be a next tour.

10:55.282 --> 10:56.869
- Oh?
- Tell him why, Hank.

10:57.450 --> 10:58.390
I...

10:59.953 --> 11:03.088
Okay, I was smoking something
I did not know was meth.

11:03.123 --> 11:05.057
- Okay.
- Then somehow my gun

11:05.091 --> 11:06.826
ended up going off
and shooting a service animal

11:06.860 --> 11:08.174
- at close range.
- Oh, God.

11:08.175 --> 11:10.196
He's got a tiny limp. He's fine.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.231
- I bet he's loving it.
- W-wait.

11:12.265 --> 11:13.829
It's still a Christmas miracle

11:13.830 --> 11:15.877
that you're home for the
birth of your baby.

11:15.878 --> 11:18.571
- The birth of <i>a</i> baby, anyway.
- Hank.

11:18.605 --> 11:20.439
I've been gone a year, Samantha.

11:20.473 --> 11:22.441
Hey, uh, thank you for your service.

11:22.475 --> 11:24.276
It's a delayed fetus!

11:24.311 --> 11:25.845
- I Googled that! No results!
- We have to go.

11:25.879 --> 11:27.279
There's cocoa in aisle nine.

11:27.314 --> 11:29.215
Your brother wasn't even in town.

11:29.249 --> 11:30.950
Should I tell you what I want?

11:30.984 --> 11:32.785
Yeah, that's a great place to start.

11:32.819 --> 11:35.140
- Uh, were you good this year?
- Yes.

11:35.141 --> 11:37.289
And would you like Santa
to bring you a real gift

11:37.324 --> 11:39.195
or a passive-aggressive one?

11:39.196 --> 11:41.961
Well, that depends.
Did you put your water glasses

11:41.995 --> 11:43.529
back in the sink,
or are there 100 of them

11:43.563 --> 11:45.364
- on your night stand?
- Come on, guys.

11:45.398 --> 11:46.966
That's so funny,
'cause I seem to remember

11:47.000 --> 11:48.434
Santa saying, "Make yourself at home."

11:48.468 --> 11:50.302
- But I guess...
- Elves don't talk.

11:50.337 --> 11:52.304
Oh, right, of course,
because if we do, Santa...

11:52.339 --> 11:54.406
bangs on the wall for us to shut up.

11:54.449 --> 11:55.674
Now say, "Candy canes!"

11:55.675 --> 11:57.810
Candy cane!

11:57.844 --> 11:59.245
I mean, it's just... It's messed up.

11:59.279 --> 12:01.080
- It is so messed up.
- You know what?

12:01.114 --> 12:03.916
I'm just gonna say it.
Men are from Mars.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.150
I just came up with that.

12:05.185 --> 12:06.886
- Oh, yes!
- Boom, boom.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.487
Do you know what I
feel like I should do?

12:08.521 --> 12:11.590
I feel like it's a good idea
to, like, go down there.

12:11.625 --> 12:15.060
- Go to her place.
- To Bridgett's house?

12:15.095 --> 12:16.996
Yeah. That's exactly
what I was thinking.

12:17.030 --> 12:20.602
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
You should not go over there.

12:21.668 --> 12:23.903
We should all go over there.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.037
- Yes.
- To Bridgett's house?

12:26.064 --> 12:28.220
Yeah, just always assume
we're talking about Bridgett's house.

12:28.221 --> 12:30.786
- Yes, let's do it.
- Okay.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.050
Oh, but how are we gonna get there?

12:33.051 --> 12:36.039
Because I try not to drive
if I've had more than six.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.771
Oh, yeah, I should not be getting
behind the wheel of a car right now.

12:47.210 --> 12:50.535
- Later, suckers!
- We're free!

12:50.536 --> 12:51.805
Whoo!

12:57.224 --> 13:00.054
This is just like the movie "Wild Hogs."

13:00.089 --> 13:01.990
- What?
- "Wild Hogs"!

13:02.926 --> 13:05.469
- Okay.
- And we're sure this is

13:05.470 --> 13:07.061
faster than walking?

13:10.366 --> 13:13.969
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:14.172 --> 13:16.007
Who wants to do Adderall off my boobs?

13:16.041 --> 13:17.406
I just crushed it up.

13:17.407 --> 13:18.780
Kind of in the middle of a game here.

13:18.781 --> 13:19.527
Okay.

13:20.345 --> 13:21.852
- Mmm!
- Okay.

13:23.448 --> 13:26.406
This is it... the vulture's nest.

13:26.952 --> 13:28.986
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

13:29.021 --> 13:31.455
Three owls? News flash...

13:31.490 --> 13:33.991
owls are notoriously solitary.

13:34.026 --> 13:35.927
- Three-owl bitch.
- All right.

13:35.961 --> 13:38.329
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna go knock on the door.

13:38.363 --> 13:39.810
Great, and then what?

13:42.167 --> 13:43.155
And then...

13:43.686 --> 13:45.803
Adam opens the door,
and then I get to see

13:45.837 --> 13:48.306
- the look on his face.
- Yas, queen!

13:48.340 --> 13:50.341
- Yes!
- I bet it's gonna be all like,

13:50.375 --> 13:54.145
"Whoa, you're a crazy stalker.
I'm scared."

13:58.183 --> 14:00.851
Oh, my God. This is a mistake.

14:00.886 --> 14:03.054
Uh, a mistake that we're
gonna laugh about one day.

14:03.088 --> 14:04.488
But not today.

14:04.523 --> 14:07.124
Oh, no, no, no. Today's gonna be a mess.

14:08.493 --> 14:10.461
We got to go. We got to go.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.196
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Oh!

14:12.230 --> 14:13.798
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.734
Oh, my God. My battery's dead.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.135
- Mine too.
- Hey, jump on with me.

14:18.170 --> 14:20.204
- I still got some juice.
- Okay.

14:20.238 --> 14:22.073
- Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh.
- What?

14:22.107 --> 14:24.008
The max capacity
for the basket is a buck-fifty.

14:24.042 --> 14:26.477
What, are you kidding me?
I don't weigh 150 pounds.

14:26.511 --> 14:27.878
If you say so, but I'm weighing you

14:27.913 --> 14:29.880
- when we get back.
- Amy?

14:30.255 --> 14:31.415
Is that you?

14:31.781 --> 14:32.524
Adam?

14:33.185 --> 14:36.988
Dubanowski? You guys...
you remember Adam.

14:37.022 --> 14:39.023
- So random!
- Oh, yeah.

14:39.057 --> 14:44.259
Yeah.

14:44.463 --> 14:47.064
Look, I'm sorry I called
Christmas "fine," okay?

14:47.099 --> 14:50.334
Look, just trust me.
When you see a child's face

14:50.369 --> 14:52.236
light up at the sight
of Old Saint Nick...

14:52.270 --> 14:54.071
You're honestly claiming

14:54.106 --> 14:56.007
your life hasn't been
improved by fajita Thursdays?

14:56.041 --> 14:57.842
Oh, you mean "clean up my greasy kitchen

14:57.876 --> 14:59.377
'cause Jonah thinks
he's Bobby Flay" Thursdays?

14:59.411 --> 15:01.012
What the [bleep] is wrong with you?

15:01.046 --> 15:02.246
What the [bleep] is wrong with you?

15:05.917 --> 15:06.781
Magical.

15:13.959 --> 15:17.094
Mmm. Wow.

15:17.129 --> 15:20.431
This coffee is... terrible.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.266
Awful. Yeah, tastes like piss.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.270
- I feel like I'm drinking piss.
- Oh, uh, sorry.

15:26.304 --> 15:28.939
So I bet you guys are
wondering why we're here.

15:28.974 --> 15:30.541
Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

15:30.575 --> 15:33.944
Well, get ready to die.

15:33.979 --> 15:35.279
Not because I'm gonna kill you,

15:35.313 --> 15:37.782
just 'cause it...
it's a really fun story.

15:37.816 --> 15:39.150
Um, I told my coworkers

15:39.184 --> 15:40.951
that I stole a car in 10th grade,

15:40.986 --> 15:42.121
and they didn't believe me.

15:42.122 --> 15:44.822
So I just need Adam to verify that.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.791
She did. 10th grade.

15:46.825 --> 15:49.493
Well, there you go.
It happ... it happened.

15:49.528 --> 15:51.228
So you drove a shopping cart three miles

15:51.263 --> 15:53.064
through the freezing cold to...

15:53.098 --> 15:55.800
Maybe you should tell us
why you're here, Adam,

15:55.834 --> 15:58.469
with little miss tight sweater
and her disgusting coffee,

15:58.503 --> 16:00.237
which if I could just get a top-up...

16:00.272 --> 16:02.406
Uh, sure. Yes.

16:02.441 --> 16:07.111
Um, okay. Well, this is awkward.

16:07.145 --> 16:10.827
But me and Bridge have
been seeing each other.

16:10.828 --> 16:12.044
Wow.

16:12.851 --> 16:14.485
Bridge. Okay.

16:14.519 --> 16:16.854
I didn't know if... if I was
supposed to tell you.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.490
It's not like there's a-a
rulebook for this kind of...

16:19.524 --> 16:20.991
Oh, what about the rulebook of respect?

16:21.026 --> 16:22.159
- That's... No, I...
- Oh, please.

16:22.194 --> 16:23.626
Do you roast your own beans?

16:23.627 --> 16:26.163
Okay, guys, it's fine.
Look, Adam's moving on.

16:26.198 --> 16:27.703
I'm moving on, too.

16:27.704 --> 16:29.467
I just started taking skydiving lessons.

16:29.501 --> 16:32.436
So we're both killing it. We should go.

16:32.471 --> 16:34.338
We have to wait
for the scooter to charge.

16:34.372 --> 16:36.240
Okay, we should sit.

16:40.645 --> 16:44.548
You wouldn't happen to have a
scale we could use, would you?

16:44.583 --> 16:45.950
Forget it.

16:48.687 --> 16:50.855
- You okay?
- Huh? Yeah.

16:50.889 --> 16:52.356
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

16:52.390 --> 16:54.191
Okay, 'cause you look a little bit

16:54.226 --> 16:56.026
like a disgruntled Keebler Elf

16:56.061 --> 16:57.528
about to shoot up the tree house.

16:57.562 --> 17:00.030
It's just... it's like he wants
to be mad at me,

17:00.065 --> 17:02.399
so he just comes up
with these little excuses.

17:02.434 --> 17:04.201
You know, like, he'll...
he'll take the trash out

17:04.236 --> 17:05.536
when it's half full
just so he can be like,

17:05.569 --> 17:07.404
"There's another thing Jonah didn't do."

17:07.439 --> 17:09.373
I only take my trash out

17:09.406 --> 17:11.142
when it topples over like a Jenga tower.

17:11.175 --> 17:14.011
Right? Thank you.
Maybe we should be roommates.

17:14.045 --> 17:16.012
Well, I'd have to run your credit check.

17:16.047 --> 17:16.712
Oh, yeah?

17:16.713 --> 17:18.439
What's your debt-to-income ratio?

17:18.440 --> 17:21.385
I want to say... seven. Is that...

17:21.419 --> 17:23.186
- That is not good.
- Is that bad? No?

17:23.221 --> 17:25.156
- No.
- Well, I ran into

17:25.190 --> 17:27.424
a lot of trouble with my, uh,
Eddie Bauer Discover card.

17:27.459 --> 17:30.161
- College.
- Yeah.

17:38.069 --> 17:40.070
- Well...
- Yep.

17:40.105 --> 17:43.240
- That was mortifying for you.
- Mm-hmm, I was there, Dina.

17:45.110 --> 17:47.578
<i>Wow. I don't know
what the hell that was.</i>

17:47.612 --> 17:49.547
<i>Okay, that was crazy.</i>

17:49.581 --> 17:52.249
- What are you doing?
- I told you.

17:52.284 --> 17:54.952
I'm Craymie. Year of Craymie!

17:54.986 --> 17:58.422
Quick, take something! Hurry, come on!

17:58.456 --> 17:59.924
Go, go!

18:02.727 --> 18:04.361
Go, go, go, go!

18:04.396 --> 18:06.697
- Go, go!
- Don't fail me now!

18:06.731 --> 18:08.065
- Go!
- There I go!

18:08.099 --> 18:09.266
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

18:09.301 --> 18:12.036
Yas, queen!

18:12.070 --> 18:14.038
Bye.

18:19.238 --> 18:21.405
I took this from the lawn

18:21.439 --> 18:24.208
<i>The Holiday Menu at Boston Pizza.</i>
of my ex-husband's girlfriend!

18:24.249 --> 18:27.051
Whoo!

18:28.466 --> 18:30.814
So you put water in his shampoo?

18:30.849 --> 18:33.117
I was diluting it to make more, okay?

18:33.151 --> 18:34.918
Oh, God.

18:34.953 --> 18:37.454
Wow, I am the worst roommate ever.

18:37.489 --> 18:39.423
I mean, I wouldn't call you great.

18:39.457 --> 18:41.291
- Yeah.
- But at least...

18:42.460 --> 18:44.794
Nope, I got nothing.

18:44.963 --> 18:47.605
Jeez. Maybe my Christmas present

18:47.606 --> 18:49.589
to Garrett should be
a night off from me.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.435
Well, I know this dive bar

18:51.469 --> 18:53.337
that's open all night Christmas Eve.

18:53.371 --> 18:56.395
They have a pool table and one
of those video poker machines...

18:56.396 --> 18:57.609
Oh.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.043
That's just sexual for no reason.

18:59.044 --> 19:01.412
Oh, well, that sounds festive.

19:01.446 --> 19:03.147
Yeah, I could...

19:03.181 --> 19:05.582
I could stay at, like,
a creepy motel nearby.

19:05.617 --> 19:07.951
Yeah, yeah, or, I don't know,

19:07.986 --> 19:10.287
maybe we'll hit it off,
and you'll end up at my place.

19:21.566 --> 19:23.869
So you guys stole her lawn ornaments?

19:23.870 --> 19:26.136
- Mm-hmm.
- Girl, you are getting crazy.

19:26.171 --> 19:29.840
I told you guys. I am a psycho.

19:29.874 --> 19:32.976
Oh, yeah, you got to let
Craymie out more often.

19:33.011 --> 19:34.878
But call her something else,

19:34.913 --> 19:37.014
'cause that name sucks.

19:37.048 --> 19:39.383
- What's wrong with Craymie?
- Hey, man, I'm gonna...

19:39.417 --> 19:41.452
I'm gonna crash elsewhere tonight, so...

19:41.486 --> 19:43.353
Not in, like, a spiteful
way or anything.

19:43.388 --> 19:46.720
Just, you know, uh, merry Christmas.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.652
Okay, thanks.

19:50.028 --> 19:52.029
And I can... I can just, like,
send you my... my add...

19:52.063 --> 19:53.297
the... the address
of where we're gonna be...

19:53.331 --> 19:55.199
- I'll be fine.
- Yeah.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.533
I'll just... I'll just drop a pin
and text it to you, then.

19:56.568 --> 19:58.335
Okay.

19:58.369 --> 20:00.537
Well, I think I finally figured out

20:00.572 --> 20:02.087
these Christmas lights.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.031
See if you can still call this "fine."

20:05.032 --> 20:06.753
Wow. Christmas lights.

20:06.754 --> 20:09.313
I've never experienced the
miracle of little lightbulbs

20:09.347 --> 20:10.372
on a string before.

20:13.384 --> 20:17.588
- Oh!
- Wow!

20:25.230 --> 20:27.998
That's, uh... super lame.

20:28.032 --> 20:30.901
Yeah. Super lame.

20:33.571 --> 20:34.709
Where's Jonah?

20:36.074 --> 20:37.263
He would love this.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.544
You know, I, uh, went to college

20:40.578 --> 20:42.369
on a pool scholarship.

20:42.370 --> 20:45.215
- Is that right?
- I'm really good at pool.

20:51.089 --> 20:52.222
Hello?

20:53.491 --> 20:56.293
Really?

20:56.327 --> 20:57.668
Yeah, hold on.

20:58.429 --> 21:01.098
You guys! Jerry's out of his coma!

21:01.132 --> 21:04.401
Is anyone sober enough
to take me to the hospital?

21:06.604 --> 21:07.639
I'll be right there.
