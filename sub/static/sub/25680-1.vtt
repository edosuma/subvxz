00:07.424 --> 00:08.258
No way!

00:08.341 --> 00:09.884
We got into the Vuuugle House?

00:09.968 --> 00:11.511
What? No. [scoffs]

00:11.594 --> 00:14.180
Amelia Duckworth just entered the room.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.807
Congratulations!

00:16.766 --> 00:19.519
Amelia, today's the day
Liam tells everyone

00:19.602 --> 00:21.813
if they got accepted
into the Vuuugle House.

00:21.896 --> 00:22.856
Aren't you nervous?

00:22.939 --> 00:24.691
I haven't really thought about it.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.818
You haven't thought about it?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.820
It's a mansion on the beach

00:28.903 --> 00:30.822
where we get to live and make videos

00:30.905 --> 00:31.990
all summer long!

00:32.073 --> 00:33.700
Eh, if I get in, I get in,

00:33.783 --> 00:34.826
if I don't, I don't.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.661
It's not a big deal.

Okay. You look stupid in turtlenecks.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.056
Liam...

00:56.139 --> 00:57.807
did we get into the Vuuugle House?

00:57.891 --> 00:58.808
And before you answer,

00:58.892 --> 01:01.186
I love the new beard.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.771

01:12.113 --> 01:14.240

01:16.034 --> 01:17.118

01:18.453 --> 01:20.080
<i>Pretend to read. Seems fine.</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:21.289
<i>Okay.</i>

01:21.581 --> 01:24.334
<i>This is the first year</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:27.087

01:27.170 --> 01:30.131
<i>So from the bottom of my heart...</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:31.383
[unenthusiastically] <i>yay.</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:37.055
This is gonna be the best summer ever.

01:37.138 --> 01:37.972
[sighs]

01:38.348 --> 01:40.266
I'm sorry you guys didn't get in.

Uh, we all got--

01:43.436 --> 01:45.355
Ah, she'll figure it out.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.439
But she's right.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.150
This is gonna be the perfect summer.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.152
The summer of us!

01:51.236 --> 01:52.320
Ooh, I like that.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.198
Hey, guys! What has two thumbs...?

01:56.533 --> 01:59.244
Uh, almost everyone on Earth?

02:00.453 --> 02:02.539
Aah! I forgot the second part.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.332
Anyways, great news.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.542
I'm gonna be joining you guys

02:05.625 --> 02:07.210
at the Vuuugle House this summer.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.170
You are? Does Liam know about this?

02:09.254 --> 02:10.422
Of course he does!

02:10.505 --> 02:12.382
Bernie Schotz is an essential cog

02:12.465 --> 02:14.092
in the Vuuugle machine.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.260
How else would I get in?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.303
You know the only reason you got in here

02:17.387 --> 02:20.306
is 'cause I was hired to be one
of the adult chaperones, right?

02:21.433 --> 02:22.267
[groans]

02:23.393 --> 02:24.436
Grandma, this stinks!

02:24.519 --> 02:27.188
People got into the Vuuugle House
because they're talented.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.232
I want to earn my spot like everyone else.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.277
Bernard, you're not like everyone else.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.529
You're the grandson of the lady chaperone.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.035
That does make me heir
to the lady chaperone fortune.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.371
But I wanna be in this house
because I deserve it.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.456
I wanna hear it from Liam.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.374

02:53.673 --> 02:55.508
<i>I know. It's creepy.</i>

02:55.592 --> 02:57.302
<i>I like it.</i>

02:57.427 --> 03:00.138
Yeah? I know how technology works.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.393
Aah, this house stinks.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.645
I'm gonna go get my tankini
out of the trunk.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.399
Liam, I want to be in this house

03:11.483 --> 03:12.650
for doing something creative.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.569
Like, what if I start my own vlog?

03:14.652 --> 03:16.529
"Bernie Calls the Schotz."

03:16.613 --> 03:17.781
If it's good enough, will you tell me

03:17.864 --> 03:19.366
I belong in the Vuuugle House?

03:20.325 --> 03:21.493
<i>Fine.</i>

03:21.576 --> 03:24.120
Good! Because a man's purpose in life...

Bernie, are you okay?

05:26.409 --> 05:29.287
You know how I've been <i>Bizaardvark's </i>agent
the past few years?

05:29.371 --> 05:30.705
No.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.625
Now, I want to do something bigger.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.169
I wanna make videos like you guys.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.629
I wanna be in this house
because I deserve it

05:37.712 --> 05:39.255
and because I'm talented.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.549
Bernie, I'm gonna help you.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.511
Really? You're gonna help me?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.471
Hey, what are friends for?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.264
Wow.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.265
Thanks, Amelia.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.558
No, I'm genuinely asking.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.435
What are friends for?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.732
This house is amazing!

05:57.816 --> 05:59.526

This is truly going to be

and scream as loud as we want!

06:13.415 --> 06:15.875
[both hollering]

06:17.377 --> 06:18.753
Wait. Is it possible

06:18.837 --> 06:21.548
that everything in this house
is made of candy?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.633
Only one way to find out.

Not candy.

I don't know.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.567
I'm not candy!

How are we supposed
to have a perfect summer

Those words have literally
never come out of your mouth.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.508
Paige, you may not know this about me,

but I, occasionally, lose my temper.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.388
[mockingly] What! You?

07:10.472 --> 07:11.681
What?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.769
But since we're spending
the summer on the beach,

07:15.852 --> 07:17.604
I wanted to be more chill,

07:17.687 --> 07:19.731
so I started doing these
breathing exercises.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.233
They really help me stay positive,
and not get worked up.

Coming through, guys!
Gonna be using your hallway

We get to live together, we get to hang
out at the beach,

07:42.629 --> 07:44.673
and we're gonna make
a ton of funny videos.

07:44.756 --> 07:45.882
Yeah, you know what, you're right.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.551
This is the Summer of Us and nothing's
gonna change that.

are gonna ruin our summer.

One, two, three, four, five.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.649
Ooh!

19:53.318 --> 19:55.653
Rodney, my unboxing gloves, please!

19:57.739 --> 19:59.699
[crowd oohs and ahs]

20:01.159 --> 20:02.369
[camera beeps]

20:03.286 --> 20:06.122
What mysteries await
in these cardboard walls?

20:06.206 --> 20:09.209
This box has six sides,

20:09.292 --> 20:11.461
as a reminder that there are many sides

20:11.544 --> 20:13.546
to every story.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.133
[whispers] That's Zane.
We haven't met yet,

20:17.217 --> 20:19.678
but I'm pretty sure we're gonna be bros.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.429
Oh, look!

20:21.513 --> 20:24.391
This box is made of recycled cardboard--

20:24.474 --> 20:28.269
cardboard that was given a second chance.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.563
We all deserve a second chance,
don't you think?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.315
[crowd murmurs agreement]

20:32.399 --> 20:33.441
All of us!

20:33.525 --> 20:35.318
Including Paige

20:35.402 --> 20:37.529
and Frankie!

20:37.612 --> 20:39.364
[crowd murmurs]

20:41.324 --> 20:43.368
<i>My word.</i>

20:43.451 --> 20:47.622
<i>That boy might just be</i>
<i>the future of Vuuugle.</i>

20:47.706 --> 20:49.416
<i>The Vuuu-ture! </i>[gasps]

20:49.833 --> 20:51.960
<i>That's it! I knew there was</i>
<i>something there!</i>

20:53.837 --> 20:56.423
Liam, we are so sorry.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.507
You were right.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.758
We should've been role models,

20:58.842 --> 21:00.510
but...

21:00.593 --> 21:01.678
instead, we were selfish.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.847
This summer isn't about just us.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.933
It's about spending time
with our whole Vuuugle family.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.603
Whaddya say, Liam?

21:10.687 --> 21:13.481
Can you pull some forgiveness
out of that face hair?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.735
[groans] <i>I suppose.</i>

21:16.818 --> 21:19.112
<i>I will need a note</i>
<i>from your parents saying--</i>

21:19.195 --> 21:20.405
[both] Done!

21:21.406 --> 21:23.867
<i>Paige, Frankie,</i>

21:23.950 --> 21:25.618
<i>let's be honest.</i>

21:25.702 --> 21:27.787
<i>I'm not going to read those.</i>

21:27.871 --> 21:29.247
<i>You're back in the house.</i>

21:29.330 --> 21:31.541
[cheering]

21:37.005 --> 21:39.466
Wow! What a moment!

21:39.549 --> 21:40.800
It'd be awesome if someone could film

21:40.884 --> 21:43.678
behind-the-scenes house stuff
like that all summer.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.639
Someone who could really call the shots.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.974
Ah, well.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.520
<i>Bernie, that's actually a good idea.</i>

21:52.604 --> 21:53.855
Thank you!

21:53.938 --> 21:55.607
I know a few people who'd be great

21:55.690 --> 21:56.941
if you want their names.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.737
He's talking about you!

22:00.820 --> 22:02.280
Bernie Schotz?

22:02.364 --> 22:03.531
And your show?

22:03.615 --> 22:05.742
<i>Bernie Calls the Schotz?</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:08.536
Where you call the shots?

22:09.788 --> 22:11.790
Well, let me know if you need those names.

22:13.041 --> 22:13.875
Bernie!

22:14.834 --> 22:17.629
He's saying you're in.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.131
You'd be in this house
because you deserve it.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.342
Really, Liam? I'm in?

22:22.425 --> 22:24.427
<i>Yes, Bernie. You're in.</i>

22:24.511 --> 22:25.553
Yes!

22:27.263 --> 22:29.224
Thanks for believing in me, Amelia.

22:29.307 --> 22:30.809
You're welcome!

22:32.936 --> 22:34.854
Wait.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.691
What happened to the snake
that was around your neck?

22:39.484 --> 22:40.777
[all scream]

22:40.902 --> 22:42.737
-[Amelia] <i>♪ Bernie lost a snake </i>♪

22:42.821 --> 22:44.698

22:44.781 --> 22:46.825
[Amelia] <i>♪ Bernie lost a snake </i>♪

22:51.830 --> 22:53.540
Whoa!

22:54.082 --> 22:55.792
You guys have bunk beds?

22:55.875 --> 22:56.876
Can I lie on the top?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.586
No, the bottom!

22:58.670 --> 22:59.838
No, the top!

22:59.921 --> 23:02.716
Oh, there's so many choices!

23:04.009 --> 23:06.761
And no ocean view? Lucky!

23:06.845 --> 23:09.806
You have no idea what the sea breeze
does to these curls.

23:11.766 --> 23:13.768
This may seem crazy,

23:13.852 --> 23:17.689
but would you, maybe,
consider switching rooms?

23:22.527 --> 23:24.863
[both stammering]

23:25.947 --> 23:26.781
[sighs]

23:27.282 --> 23:30.410
You know, I could get used to this.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.704
[Zane shouting] Door slamming contest!

23:32.787 --> 23:34.789
-[boys laughing]
-[doors slamming]

23:35.832 --> 23:37.917
Well, if you can't beat 'em!
