using your soul,

20:20.594 --> 20:22.054
and damn mankind to death

20:22.137 --> 20:23.931
without our HereAfter.
- He took away our choice.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.934
Broke us, made us forget joy.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.437
If you stop fighting me,
and just let me in.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.606
You don't have to be a copy.

20:34.232 --> 20:36.193
- I can be the upgrade.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.501
- Chase? Are you--

20:52.584 --> 20:55.629
- I've had this scar
a long time.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.589
I'm just embracing it now.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.302
- I knew you could do it.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.096
- I felt you take
back the steering.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.639
Chase, are you--

21:05.722 --> 21:09.142
- All there?
- More than ever. You?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.269
- New and improved, my man.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.021
<i>- Can we continue
the love fest later?</i>

21:13.105 --> 21:15.649
<i>'Cause we're seconds
from crashing.</i>

21:15.732 --> 21:18.485
- Yes! Chase, let me mind-share
our plan to you.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.904
Do not object.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.828
<i>- This is all so exciting.</i>

22:15.250 --> 22:18.879
<i>- We have to burrow or we're
going to kill a lot of people.</i>

22:36.855 --> 22:39.232
- Woo-hoo! I did it!

22:52.162 --> 22:53.830
- This is Twilight?

22:53.914 --> 22:55.832
- Oh, my God.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.543
This is way fuckin' worse
than I thought.
