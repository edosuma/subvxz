15:25.250 --> 15:27.500
he will be a great contributor
to our society.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.666
He destroyed a building.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.333
Is this the sort of contribution
we can expect?

15:33.416 --> 15:34.791
[Heimerdinger] If you were a scientist,

15:34.875 --> 15:38.416
you'd know you can't make a prototype
without breaking a few wrenches.

15:39.166 --> 15:42.250
Do you have anything to show
for your work besides an explosion?

15:42.333 --> 15:44.916
Uh, no. It came to nothing.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.625
[Mel] So, you're saying
your study was meaningless?

15:47.708 --> 15:50.583
-It was revolutionary!
-Revolutionary how?

15:50.666 --> 15:54.250
All I see is a boy meddling with things
he doesn't understand.

15:54.333 --> 15:57.041
The Academy seems
to have loosened its standards.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.666
This is a fine line.
If we condone this, what's next?

15:59.750 --> 16:00.958
[Salo] Ridiculous, really.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.916
[Shoola] The Council has more
important matters to deal with.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.041
[Mel] Perhaps we should just finish this…

16:05.125 --> 16:07.833
I was trying to create magic.

16:07.916 --> 16:09.875
[crowd exclaiming]

16:09.958 --> 16:10.958
[crunches]

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Magic?

16:15.083 --> 16:17.750
Arcane talents are something
you're born with.

16:17.833 --> 16:20.000
They can't be fabricated.

16:20.083 --> 16:22.041
Actually, I believe it is possible.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.250
Has anyone even tried it before?

16:26.750 --> 16:28.125
[Bolbok clears throat]

16:28.208 --> 16:33.000
The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.

16:33.083 --> 16:37.375
Surely, we, the pioneers of science,
can use it for good.

16:37.458 --> 16:41.333
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it?

16:41.416 --> 16:42.375
Jayce, enough.

16:42.458 --> 16:46.416
This is the city of progress,
think of the wonders we could create.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.541
-Let me prove--
-[Heimerdinger] Enough!

16:49.666 --> 16:51.875
You don't understand what's at stake.

16:52.916 --> 16:54.375
But how can you?

16:55.041 --> 16:57.541
That's a burden that only I here carry.

16:58.583 --> 16:59.791
Time.

17:01.875 --> 17:05.041
I've seen this power in the wrong hands.

17:05.541 --> 17:11.166
It corrupts, consumes,
lays waste to civilizations.

17:13.375 --> 17:17.458
That cannot happen here, my boy.
It must not.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.333
Heimerdinger is right.

17:20.416 --> 17:23.916
Piltover was founded to escape
the warmongering of mages,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.250
-not cultivate it.
-[Bolbok mutters]

17:26.333 --> 17:30.208
The Ethos is clear.
He must be banished from Piltover.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.125
[gasps]

17:31.208 --> 17:33.166
[crowd muttering]

17:33.250 --> 17:34.500
[Ximena] Please, let me speak!

17:35.083 --> 17:37.208
[footsteps approaching]

17:39.541 --> 17:42.833
As a lower house, my voice
doesn't carry much weight here.

17:42.916 --> 17:46.458
But as a mother,
I have a voice that matters deeply.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.250
My son isn't in his right mind.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.958
His entire life,
he's chased an impossible dream.

17:54.916 --> 17:59.000
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.

17:59.833 --> 18:04.208
But he has a good heart.
Please, let him come home.

18:04.291 --> 18:08.666
A crime like this can't be overlooked.
The boy must be punished.

18:08.750 --> 18:12.166
A violation of the Ethos
calls for banishment,

18:12.250 --> 18:16.250
but I can sympathize with a young man's
dream to change the world.

18:16.833 --> 18:20.583
Perhaps in this matter,
a lesser sentence may suffice.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.625
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled
from the Academy

18:24.708 --> 18:27.541
and remanded to the care of his parents.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.375
All those in favor?

18:33.041 --> 18:36.458
[ominous music plays]

18:45.333 --> 18:47.958
[Heimerdinger]
You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,

18:48.041 --> 18:51.416
but he is to never set foot
on Academy grounds again.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.750
[door whirring]

19:11.208 --> 19:14.333
[disembodied voices]

19:14.416 --> 19:16.458
[approaching footsteps]

19:24.791 --> 19:29.291
First time I've been invited to the Lanes.
It better be worth my time.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.083
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.

19:33.166 --> 19:37.333
You carry your chin so high,
you fail to see the opportunity below.

19:37.416 --> 19:38.541
[Marcus] Who are you?

19:39.083 --> 19:41.583
You're looking for four children,

19:41.666 --> 19:44.708
the ones running circles
around Piltover's finest.

19:44.791 --> 19:46.041
[Marcus] What about it?

19:46.708 --> 19:51.000
Don't look so concerned.
I'm about to make your day.

19:52.375 --> 19:55.000
-[thunder rumbling]
-[rain pattering]

20:00.208 --> 20:02.041
[knocks on door]

20:02.125 --> 20:04.416
-[door opens]
-[Ximena] Can I come in?

20:08.291 --> 20:09.458
Hmm.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.833
I still remember the look on your face
when you found these.

20:15.291 --> 20:16.541
[sighs]

20:17.375 --> 20:22.083
Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken,
you'd be lost to me.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.000
I had to say something.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.833
Magic saved your life.

20:28.375 --> 20:33.916
Yes, but it won't save yours now.
You need to let it go.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
I could've convinced the Council.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.708
If my own family won't help me,
I'll find someone who will.

20:41.583 --> 20:44.833
[dramatic music plays]

20:51.875 --> 20:54.041
[Heimerdinger] Oh. That foolish boy.

20:54.125 --> 20:57.250
[Viktor] Yeah, I must admit,
his theory intrigues.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.833
If dangerous ideas
didn't excite the imagination,

20:59.916 --> 21:01.500
we would never wander astray.

21:01.583 --> 21:06.541
Could it work? Could these stones
really invoke magic?

21:06.625 --> 21:08.958
Nonsense. It's far too unstable.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.041
Could you stabilize it?

21:11.125 --> 21:13.291
Me? Why would I?

21:13.375 --> 21:15.166
That only leads to more problems,

21:15.250 --> 21:17.458
and that poor boy
has enough of them already.

21:17.541 --> 21:22.500
There. Come tomorrow morning,
his research will be safely disposed of.

21:23.208 --> 21:24.166
[Heimerdinger] Lock up.

21:25.541 --> 21:30.416
No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous
in the wrong hands.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.625
[Silco] Will he live?

21:36.625 --> 21:37.875
[Singed] Long enough.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.291
[water gurgles]

21:48.125 --> 21:49.666
Beautiful, aren't they?

21:51.375 --> 21:55.166
Yet, up there on the surface,

21:55.250 --> 21:57.458
no one even knows they exist.

21:58.208 --> 21:59.666
They're monsters.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.958
There's a monster inside all of us.

22:06.750 --> 22:10.583
What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!

22:13.833 --> 22:16.833
I'd like to let you in
on a very important secret

22:16.916 --> 22:19.458
I learned when I was about your age, boy.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.500
You see, power,

22:24.083 --> 22:28.208
real power doesn't come to those
who were born strongest,

22:28.291 --> 22:30.833
or fastest, or smartest.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.416
No.

22:33.500 --> 22:38.916
It comes to those
who will do anything to achieve it.

22:40.833 --> 22:44.458
-It's time to let the monster out.
-[heavy breathing]

23:32.416 --> 23:33.958
Your name's no good now.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.208
My dad says you're a misfit,
and that we can't be friends anymore.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.625
So, why are you out here?

23:43.875 --> 23:46.291
I'm a misfit too, I suppose.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.500
What will you do?

23:50.583 --> 23:53.000
Join the Talis hammer business, I guess.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.708
You can't do that.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.041
No, I can't.

24:00.416 --> 24:03.583
Come inside, Caitlyn. Now.

24:11.666 --> 24:14.250
I'm sorry. I just wanted to explain…

24:14.333 --> 24:15.875
I think you've done enough.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.958
[thunder rumbles]

24:22.916 --> 24:24.833
[Mel] You said this was a robbery.

24:24.916 --> 24:27.375
-Did they take anything dangerous?
-[Grayson] Hard to say.

24:27.458 --> 24:31.250
We don't exactly know what we did find,
let alone what we didn't.

24:31.333 --> 24:34.708
This mention of magic
has the people afraid.

24:34.791 --> 24:37.166
The culprits must be apprehended.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.916
We're doing our best, Councilor.
I assure you.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.041
Your attitude makes me question
if your best is up to the task.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.916
Oh, we'll find them. Don't worry.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.625
We've conducted exhaustive interrogations,
frozen commerce for half the district.

24:50.708 --> 24:52.333
With all due respect, Councilor,

24:52.416 --> 24:55.166
don't you think
we've pushed them hard enough?

24:55.250 --> 24:57.416
Do whatever it takes.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.208
Turn the undercity upside down
if you have to.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.291
Just find them!

-Never let that happen.
-It's already happening.

What I don't understand
is how you can work with them.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.041
We were here. We saw what they did.

29:53.916 --> 29:59.166
I grew up knowing I'm less than them,
that my place is down there.

30:00.041 --> 30:04.250
I want Powder to have more than that,
and I'm willing to fight for it.

30:05.583 --> 30:10.541
So was I. I was angry, just like you.
