Drop me /'n the water

02:52.460 --> 02:53.779
PupaL

02:54.670 --> 02:56.080
Papal, pupal...

03:11.350 --> 03:12.647
Stag.

03:15.940 --> 03:17.146
Lusty.

03:20.780 --> 03:21.906
Salty.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.360
Patsy.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.370
Aptly.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.910
Aptly.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.000
Splat.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.810
Splay.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.679
Pulp.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.196
Plus.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.520
Ah.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.075
Strap.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.740
Alps.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.785
Yappy.

04:15.750 --> 04:16.956
Sappy.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.080
Layups.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.419
Platypus.

04:36.230 --> 04:37.606
Platypus.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.197
- Come on.
- Drop that pea/cl

04:47.280 --> 04:49.236
The day] met you,
there were vultures in the sky.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.695
Should have taken that for an omen.

04:50.790 --> 04:51.996
Those were blue/Jim’s!

04:52.080 --> 04:53.786
lVow, stop worry/hi
I’ll get you out of this.

04:53.870 --> 04:55.918
lVo, look, look.
Don ’t get me out of things,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.911
stop getting me into things, wﬂl you?

Look, Haro/o’.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.757
- French pooo’les.
- /Vo./ Those are sheep!

05:36.250 --> 05:37.706
Not another one.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.660
Hey!

05:48.430 --> 05:50.341
Where are you coming from?

06:03.610 --> 06:05.100
Oh, my God.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.520
M
al
am?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.446
Can you hear me?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.405
Jesus.

06:15.660 --> 06:16.706
Okay.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.279
Hey!

06:20.460 --> 06:22.451
Oh, God. Oh, boy.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.832
- I have to get back.
- No.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.711
You're safe now.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.290
Don't you worry about that.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.006
Okay. All right.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.800
You are injured.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.477
I need to see how bad, okay?

06:38.020 --> 06:39.476
Hey...

06:44.400 --> 06:45.606
Ah...

06:48.200 --> 06:50.191
Well, good news is, it's not a bite.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.276
That's about as good news
as you can expect these days.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.661
I'm sorry.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.489
Yeah.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.205
I'm gonna take care of this wound
as best I can,

07:05.300 --> 07:06.870
and I'll get you to sleep, okay?

08:00.270 --> 08:01.680
On the visor.

08:01.770 --> 08:03.476
Don't come any closer!

08:03.560 --> 08:05.721
No, no. The keys.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.930
They're on top of the visor.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.025
But, er...

08:18.740 --> 08:20.492
Transmission sticks.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.615
So you might want to avoid reverse,

08:23.290 --> 08:25.872
unless you want it to become
a permanent situation.

08:29.590 --> 08:32.127
I just found you washed up by the river.

08:32.670 --> 08:34.331
You got a pretty bad cut.

08:34.930 --> 08:38.252
It's not a bite or a scratch,
there's nothing angry about it.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.056
All right.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.356
Yeah.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.271
It needs a new battery.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.276
I've been meaning to attend to that.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.157
Look, if you're gonna go,

09:03.710 --> 09:06.031
then I might as well
set you up with food and water.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.417
Make sure you're rested.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.292
We might oughta change that bandage, too.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.467
Okay?

10:03.640 --> 10:04.971
Can you do it?

10:06.520 --> 10:08.181
- I don't know.
- I can't.

10:10.190 --> 10:11.566
And I need stitches.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.066
Right.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.988
Take one hand,
hold the edges of the wound together,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.571
and then sew in one continuous loop.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.202
Continuous loop.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.996
Okay, excuse me.

10:34.630 --> 10:37.042
- All right. You sure about this?
- Just do it.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.466
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.561
This is fish stew.

11:02.450 --> 11:07.114
But I believe zee French
call it bouillabaisse.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.666
So...

11:20.970 --> 11:22.676
Soup is... Soup...

11:22.890 --> 11:26.769
Soup is the blanket of food. So...

11:27.310 --> 11:28.550
What?

11:29.850 --> 11:31.010
I...

11:32.400 --> 11:34.356
It's been a while since I had company.

11:35.650 --> 11:36.935
But, er...

11:37.780 --> 11:39.236
Enjoy your soup.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.078
And, er, my name's John, by the way.

11:48.660 --> 11:50.070
Thanks, John.

11:56.460 --> 12:00.044
You look like a Laura, ifI had to guess.

12:00.510 --> 12:03.172
Would Laura be
an acceptable substitute for now?

12:09.430 --> 12:10.636
Yeah.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.938
I used to work
at Humbug Gulch on weekends.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.937
Is that for, like, pizza or something?

12:18.650 --> 12:21.528
No! It's like trick shooting

12:21.610 --> 12:24.602
and lassoing for the kids
and discerning adults.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.157
You might know it more as Wild West shows.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.577
It was just something I did for fun.

12:36.460 --> 12:39.418
You know, you are welcome to stay here
as long as you need, Laura.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.461
I'll be moving on as soon as I can.

12:45.050 --> 12:46.290
Okay.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.302
But there's food and shelter here
till you're ready.

12:50.850 --> 12:54.058
Well, maybe next time
you need something, you just ask.

12:54.980 --> 12:57.437
'Cause, my word...

13:05.070 --> 13:06.526
Hey!

13:06.620 --> 13:08.520
I made you some privacy.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.860
I said I'm not staying long.

13:12.330 --> 13:13.536
No...

13:14.790 --> 13:18.339
What are you, a doctor? A nurse?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.831
I figured it's a safe bet
that you'd make resting up a priority,

13:21.920 --> 13:23.968
so I just made you some privacy
to facilitate.

13:24.050 --> 13:25.210
You can take the bed.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.382
No, couch is fine. I don't sleep anyways.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.255
You don't sleep?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.807
Hour, two hours if I'm lucky.

13:32.390 --> 13:35.052
It's the damnedest thing. I used to,

13:35.560 --> 13:37.437
I just haven't in a good while.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.812
Anyway, I left you
a clean shirt on the bed. So...

13:46.860 --> 13:48.862
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.730
How'd you know I was a nurse?

13:55.580 --> 13:59.869
Well, I don't know too many people
eager to stick a needle in their side.

14:06.130 --> 14:08.792
Were you a nurse all the way up until...

14:10.470 --> 14:11.801
Yeah.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.840
Seems like forever ago, doesn't it?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.806
It does.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.396
Well, good night.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.976
They wash up here?

16:26.560 --> 16:29.222
Yeah. There's something amiss upriver.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.231
Need to suss it out.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.020
Plus, it's Tuesday.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.729
What happens on Tuesdays?

16:38.950 --> 16:40.360
Go to the store.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.904
A store.

16:43.290 --> 16:44.666
I go to it.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.739
I'll come.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.626
Oh, you should probably rest up.

16:50.380 --> 16:53.372
No, I need some new dressings.
I don't want this to get infected.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.171
I can get those for you.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.255
Rather do it myself.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.136
Well, if you're feeling up to it,

17:00.970 --> 17:02.801
I suppose I wouldn't mind the company.

17:05.310 --> 17:07.141
You should wear these boots.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.523
They'll be big on you,
but anything's better than those.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.026
There's snakes out here.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.736
No, I want to be able to run if I need to.

17:16.820 --> 17:18.697
You can run in those.
They won't hold you back.

17:18.780 --> 17:19.940
No, thanks.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.496
Suit yourself.

17:44.810 --> 17:46.437
You been out here long?

17:47.690 --> 17:49.396
A good while, I suppose.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.817
What did you do? Before, I mean.

17:55.610 --> 17:57.407
I was a police officer.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.941
Why didn't you bring your guns?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.206
What guns you mean?

18:06.870 --> 18:08.531
I thought all cops had guns.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.529
No.

18:11.630 --> 18:13.791
They cause more problems than they solve.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.008
Plus, they just attract
more of the passed, in my experience.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.672
Did you like it? Being a cop?

18:23.600 --> 18:24.919
For a time.

18:51.420 --> 18:52.876
Is that yours?

18:52.960 --> 18:54.951
I mean, is that
how you ended up in the river?

18:55.050 --> 18:57.416
No. I'm a better driver than that.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.129
Look out.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.220
Hey, buddy.

19:15.230 --> 19:17.528
- There's your problem.
- Yes, ma'am.

19:18.030 --> 19:20.066
That's something that needs tending to.

19:55.650 --> 19:57.311
What is this place?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.065
Er, it was Bill's.

19:59.610 --> 20:00.986
I think it was his father's.

20:01.070 --> 20:03.982
I believe it's been in the family
for 60 years.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.362
- Where's Bill now?
- Not sure.

20:09.450 --> 20:12.453
They closed the road for repairs
just before everything went south.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.877
Haven't seen anybody since.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.005
Here you go.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.386
Help yourself to whatever you want.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.880
There's no shopping carts to speak of.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.719
I'll manage.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.057
You rearranging the place?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.437
People always need splints and dressings,

21:19.150 --> 21:21.892
and when you're in trouble,
it's hard to think outside the box.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.736
Just doing my part.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.600
You've done this before.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.986
I'm luclq to have a job
that's still useful now.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.281
Blue Sky.

21:35.830 --> 21:37.457
You like movies?

21:38.290 --> 21:40.497
I've been making
a study of the collection.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.916
I went through
the whole thing alphabetical first,

21:43.340 --> 21:45.968
but you always just end up going back
to your favourites.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.209
Your last name's Dorie?

21:53.310 --> 21:56.347
Yeah, like the fish, but I-E, no Y.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.760
Your name is John Dorie,

21:59.310 --> 22:00.686
like the fish,

22:01.230 --> 22:02.857
and you like fishing.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.026
Yeah.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.326
Okay.

22:30.760 --> 22:31.920
What?

22:32.430 --> 22:33.966
We're gonna need a ladder.

22:42.270 --> 22:44.101
Thanks for your help, Laura.

22:45.940 --> 22:48.067
Is it okay if I call you that?

22:48.450 --> 22:49.565
Laura's fine.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.147
There ’s enough
circulation in that man

23:24.230 --> 23:25.686
to sta/t a shortage in the ink market.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.236
- In what man?
- John Doe.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.523
- What John Doe?
- Our John Doe! The one .7 made up/

23:30.610 --> 23:32.441
Look, genius. Now, look.

23:32.530 --> 23:34.236
Suppose there was a John Doe,

23:34.330 --> 23:36.195
and he walked into this ofﬁce.
What would you do?

23:36.290 --> 23:39.453
Fino’ mm a job and forget about
the whole business, I suppose, huh?

23:39.540 --> 23:41.326
Oh, I'm disturbing you. I'm sorry.

23:45.130 --> 23:47.086
Tuesday's usually my movie night.

23:47.630 --> 23:49.370
Well, to be honest,

23:50.090 --> 23:52.251
every night's pretty much
movie night these days.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.210
I just want some water.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.381
I'll turn the volume down.

23:56.470 --> 23:58.131
I've seen this so many times,

23:58.350 --> 24:00.136
pretty much know what they're gonna say.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.896
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.776
- Yeah?
- He thinks of the river, but no.

24:11.860 --> 24:14.613
No, he has a better idea.
The City Hall. Why?

24:14.700 --> 24:16.270
Because he wants to attract attention.

24:16.370 --> 24:17.906
He wants to get a few things
of?c his chest;

24:17.990 --> 24:19.867
and that’s the only way
he can get h/mse/fhearo’.

24:19.950 --> 24:21.110
- So?
- So?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.246
So he writes me a letter
and I dig him up.

24:23.330 --> 24:25.036
He pours out his soul to me.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.167
From now on we quote,
”Iprotest; by John Doe. ”

24:28.250 --> 24:29.956
He protests against all the ewls
in the world...

24:30.050 --> 24:31.790
You know, sometimes on movie night,

24:31.880 --> 24:34.462
I take my butterscotch and my caramels,

24:34.550 --> 24:36.848
melt 'em together into a kind of brittle.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.016
Saw you take those Blackjacks
from Bill's earlier.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.684
Maybe throw a couple of those in there,
see how that turns out.

24:45.900 --> 24:46.969
Okay.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.389
Yep.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.645
Right.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.310
It's gonna be great.

24:58.370 --> 25:00.611
My name is Be/t Hansen, Mr. Doe.

25:01.160 --> 25:04.072
I ’m heao’ soo’a jerk
at Schwabacher’s Drug Store.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.788
Well, sir, you see, me and my wife,
we heard your broadcast;

25:07.880 --> 25:10.917
we got quite a bang out of it;
espeCIa/ly my wife.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.082
Kept me up half the night saying,
”That man ’5 right; honey.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.138
The trouble with the world is,
nobody gives a hoot about his ne/ghbour.

25:17.220 --> 25:18.596
Thatis why everybody in town... ”

25:18.680 --> 25:20.307
I lost my child.

25:21.930 --> 25:24.182
”Well, that’s ﬁne,
but how’s a guy gonna go around

25:24.270 --> 25:26.477
loving the kind of ne/ghbours we got?”

25:27.100 --> 25:31.890
I jumped out of bed and I walked
right through the wall here,

25:31.980 --> 25:33.811
r/ght stra/ght into your room.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.527
You know how dreams are.

25:36.030 --> 25:39.443
And there you were in bed.
But you... You were a little girl.

25:39.530 --> 25:41.077
You know, about ten.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.150
And very pretty, too.

25:44.330 --> 25:48.039
So, I shook you, and at the moment
you opened your eyes...

25:55.470 --> 25:57.006
Teach me to fish.

25:58.470 --> 26:00.882
Well, is this a request

26:00.970 --> 26:03.018
for a formal lesson,
or something a little more casual?

26:03.100 --> 26:05.011
A river's a resource. _
I should know how to use It.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.800
Well, all right, then.

26:08.850 --> 26:10.511
I'll grab you some gear.

26:13.900 --> 26:16.061
A little slack. A little more slack.

26:17.860 --> 26:21.614
Open the face of the reel like that, yeah,
top of the cast, just let go.

26:24.410 --> 26:26.958
Good. Perfect.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.166
Keep a little tension on it.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.995
Let it drift.

26:34.590 --> 26:37.252
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Tip up! Tip up!

26:38.550 --> 26:41.633
Pull him in. Reel it in. Nice, nice, nice!
You got it.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.459
Don't have to go deep.

26:45.890 --> 26:48.347
Just straight up,
right between them fins.

26:49.270 --> 26:51.101
Go in there.
Just like anything else.

26:51.190 --> 26:52.259
- See it?
-Mmmmmm.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.725
All right, there...

26:55.150 --> 26:56.606
Cut it out.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.566
- This is really good.
- Yep.

27:02.410 --> 27:03.729
Thanks for teaching me.

27:04.330 --> 27:06.446
It'll come in handy out there.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.996
Yeah, it will come in handy out there.

28:05.890 --> 28:08.802
There might be a little bit of a scar.

28:10.430 --> 28:12.512
But nothing too bad.

28:13.060 --> 28:14.391
Hang on.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.145
There.

28:23.950 --> 28:25.235
I think I'm ready.

28:29.660 --> 28:30.900
Right.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.529
Seeing as I'm all healed up
and everything.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.417
- Nothin' keeping you here now.
- Yeah, I said I was gonna be leaving.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.047
You said, soon as you were able.

28:40.130 --> 28:42.212
Take a couple days to pack some things.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.585
Be on your way.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.912
I think that patch up on the bridge
could use my attention.

29:22.590 --> 29:25.081
We're gonna need something stronger
to block that opening.

29:26.180 --> 29:29.343
Maybe one of the cars parked at Bill's
still has a charge in it.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.386
I can handle it.

29:33.640 --> 29:34.971
You helped me.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.016
It's the least I can do.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.469
Up to you.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.627
All right.

30:00.710 --> 30:02.507
Hey, where'd you learn to do that?

30:03.300 --> 30:05.211
Some woman in a camp I lived in.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.250
You gonna arrest me?

30:16.310 --> 30:18.346
I asked you not to go through my things.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.725
We're driving on a bridge
filled with the dead.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.356
We might need to protect ourselves.

30:23.650 --> 30:24.981
You're good with the knife.

30:25.070 --> 30:27.652
This is just gonna bring more of 'em.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.651
Those guns aren't doing anyone
any good in a box.

30:32.740 --> 30:35.152
I want 'em in a box.
I don't want 'em out here.

31:08.490 --> 31:09.775
Good job.

31:34.930 --> 31:37.057
Okay, just stay straight,
you're good.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.355
John.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.059
Shoot it.

31:50.150 --> 31:51.777
- No.
- Shoot it, John!

31:51.860 --> 31:52.940
No!

31:57.750 --> 31:59.035
Shoot him!

32:01.540 --> 32:02.575
John!

32:04.340 --> 32:05.489
Shoot him!

32:17.680 --> 32:18.965
John!

32:40.120 --> 32:41.997
I didn't get bit.

32:42.410 --> 32:44.162
It wasn't close enough to bite you.

32:44.250 --> 32:47.458
I've seen people get really sick
from just being exposed to this stuff.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.962
Well, I didn't mean for that to happen.

32:51.050 --> 32:54.042
You could have stopped it before it got
close to you. You had the gun.

32:54.550 --> 32:55.676
It's not how I do things.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.716
How you do things nearly got you killed.

32:57.810 --> 33:01.177
Well, better me than somebody else.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.050
What are you talking about?

33:11.900 --> 33:14.528
This doesn't have to do
with using guns on the dead.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.861
This has to do with using guns.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.743
Is that why you don't like
talking about being a cop?

33:32.550 --> 33:35.462
Did somebody take your gun,
or did you have to fire it?

33:40.220 --> 33:41.676
I fired it.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.510
Good guy or bad guy?

33:48.110 --> 33:49.725
I don't look at things that way.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.680
But I guess you'd call him a bad guy.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.441
Was it a mistake?

33:54.950 --> 33:56.440
Or was it intentional?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.230
It's not that simple.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.493
It... It was an intentional mistake.

34:07.170 --> 34:11.209
I stopped at the gas station
after one of my shows at the Gulch.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.331
This guy was robbing the place.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.674
I told him I was a police officer,
put down his weapon.

34:20.010 --> 34:21.341
He would not.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.476
So I tried to clip him in the leg...

34:28.730 --> 34:31.358
- It's okay.
- No. No, it's not okay.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.560
Because he turned.

34:37.780 --> 34:39.657
I hit him dead centre in that leg,

34:40.030 --> 34:41.406
and he bled out.

34:52.130 --> 34:54.507
- Is that why you moved up here?
- No.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.376
Why'd you move up here?

34:58.090 --> 34:59.330
Hmm...

35:04.180 --> 35:06.478
'Cause people thought I was a hero.

35:19.610 --> 35:22.443
Doesn't matter how many people
say it's not your fault.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.366
Only thing that matters
is if you believe it.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.396
Laura!

38:00.820 --> 38:02.105
John!

38:58.000 --> 38:59.240
Thank you.

39:05.050 --> 39:07.792
You may not think you're a hero,
but I do.

39:11.510 --> 39:13.341
And an honourable person.

39:16.770 --> 39:20.183
I'm very, very luclq
to have washed up in your front yard.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.019
I can't.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.776
If you're going, you'll need it.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.945
And I need you to take it.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.328
I'm gonna sit on the porch.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.365
What's the matter?

40:19.450 --> 40:20.860
Just leave it be.

40:22.290 --> 40:23.746
Why won't you look at me?

40:25.460 --> 40:27.200
- What is it?
- Nothing.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.756
John".

40:37.350 --> 40:38.635
I love you.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.430
Well, I...

40:44.520 --> 40:46.147
And I didn't want you to know.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.146
Why didn't you want me to know?

40:51.700 --> 40:53.406
'Cause you're gonna leave.

40:54.700 --> 40:56.270
And I don't want you to.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.695
I don't want you to.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.992
If you want to be on your own,
you stay. I'll go.

41:10.340 --> 41:12.001
I need you alive.

41:15.550 --> 41:17.791
If you're alive, this whole world...

41:20.220 --> 41:22.268
This whole world feels alive.

41:48.750 --> 41:50.331
I wanna know

41:50.420 --> 41:52.206
Can you help me

41:52.300 --> 41:56.999
I 7/ never be

42:01.060 --> 42:03.517
Drop me in the water

42:26.580 --> 42:27.956
Laura?

42:50.650 --> 42:51.719
Oh...

43:06.040 --> 43:07.530
She loved you.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.160
Yes.

43:18.380 --> 43:20.883
- Maybe if I'd waited to tell her...
- No.

43:21.550 --> 43:24.132
There ain't no waiting, not in this world.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.050
Waiting, that's...

43:31.770 --> 43:33.818
That's how you lose people.

43:40.110 --> 43:41.907
It's stupid to say...

43:46.290 --> 43:47.780
...but I believed

43:48.370 --> 43:50.031
we'd have a second chance.

43:52.790 --> 43:54.087
Stupid.

44:01.590 --> 44:03.342
Maybe we still do.

44:06.770 --> 44:07.964
Alicia.

44:08.930 --> 44:11.478
Strand. Luciana. They're still here.

44:14.860 --> 44:19.069
They think the only thing left
is to fight and kill and die.

44:20.860 --> 44:22.691
- Maybe they're right.
- Hey.

44:22.990 --> 44:24.651
- Maybe.
- No! Look me in the eye

44:24.740 --> 44:26.230
and tell me that's what you believe.

44:26.490 --> 44:28.230
Tell me that's what you believe
and we'll...

44:28.330 --> 44:29.945
We'll go our separate ways.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.240
I do not believe that.

44:34.830 --> 44:36.036
I do not.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.375
We're alive.

44:41.880 --> 44:44.178
We are part of the world.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.931
Let's not waste another second.
