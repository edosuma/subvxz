14:44.440 --> 14:45.885
- Spruce up.
- ANDREA: Give the place a shot in the ass.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.962
ZAK: Decorating. Okay, here we go.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.610
ANDREA: The space has a classic feel

14:49.680 --> 14:52.251
that was really cool
when you guys first started out, but now...

14:52.320 --> 14:56.370
Yeah, well, we got a budget situation,
so decorating...

14:56.440 --> 14:59.091
Artists come in here, they think you're square.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.321
That and the logo.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.128
Uh, what's wrong with the logo?

15:03.200 --> 15:04.929
The toilet thing, enough already.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.811
I can't be the first person
ever mention it to your face.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.480
The logo looks like a toilet.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.131
PENNY: Holy shit, it looks like a toilet.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.248
SKIP: With a turd?
CASPER: Just a bowl.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.607
SCOTT: Fuck, now it's like
the duck and the rabbit.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.001
Once you see it, you can't unsee it.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.926
Maybe it's not a priority right now,
but we are in the image business.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.843
We look like a toilet, it's a fucking priority.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.649
Hal, you never saw this?

15:34.720 --> 15:37.200
- Nobody saw it.
- Apparently, everybody but us saw it.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.770
Look, easy to fix.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.763
Get a little color in here, new shape,

15:40.840 --> 15:43.286
put the sublabel front and center,
have your college reps plug it.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.805
Yeah, we don't have college reps.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.490
We'll get that going.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.561
You working with Corso?

15:49.040 --> 15:50.769
- What?
- ANDREA: Joe Corso.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.524
We got to get him
to start talking up Grand Funk.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.886
I think we're leaving spins on the table.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.291
Tell Heather I want to see her.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.921
- Where's Julie?
- We got a new band.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.923
He's helping them replace their lead guitar.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.404
- You one of his guys?
- I'm one of his guys.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.683
Oh. Fantastic.
You know about the Biafra benefit?

16:13.520 --> 16:15.488
What, is that a disease?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.164
- It's a country.
- Biafrica?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.810
It's in Africa. Biafra.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.609
- What did I just say?
- SCOTT: Biafrica.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.728
- All right. Fuck you.
- Fourteen artists will be performing.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.485
Jackie landed the soundtrack,
but he did the whole thing on a handshake,

16:25.560 --> 16:27.688
and a handshake's not a deal, turns out.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.683
- We could lock down Melanie for a set.
- Yeah.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.801
- Yeah.
- ANDREA: That's great.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.166
I was gonna talk to David Bowie.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.208
He doesn't like Jackie,
so if it's not him, he might jump in.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.886
I met him, David Bowie,
at Leon Schneider's thing last year.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.644
I could probably get a phone call
in to his manager.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.881
Oh, yeah, David's in town tonight.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.726
I was just gonna stop by his rehearsal,
take him out for a bite before the show.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.441
Oh. Yeah, that'll work.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.363
You want to come? He'd love you.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.124
Look at this fucking chick.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.249
Ain't she a kick in the ass?

16:54.640 --> 16:56.085
Zito!

16:56.280 --> 16:57.725
(MUSIC PLAYING)

17:01.760 --> 17:04.047
There's so many things
that I want to do to you.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.281
Yeah. Now. There's so many...

17:06.440 --> 17:09.125
Oh, yeah. Oh, that feels good.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.362
Yeah, play with it. Yeah.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.407
Yeah. Oh, God.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.810

17:17.640 --> 17:19.483
- I'm so ready for you.
- Yeah?

17:19.599 --> 17:21.364
Are you ready for me? Oh, yeah, yeah.

Give it to me, yeah.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.802
Oh, tear me open.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.400
Are you okay?

17:49.240 --> 17:51.004
Can I suck on you? Yeah?

17:52.560 --> 17:54.688
You know what? I got to go.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.768
- No. What?
- Work.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.441
We'll try again another time, okay?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.931
You're fucking beautiful.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.650
You just storm out? What the fuck was that?

18:13.720 --> 18:14.960
I do what I want.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.884
Anyway, I already heard Andrea's spiel.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.610
- That was for you.
- For me?

(RICHIE SNORTING)

18:22.320 --> 18:23.890

All her ideas are gonna
cost us an arm and a leg.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.844
You remember math?
I mean, I love Andrea, but...

18:29.960 --> 18:32.088
I know you do. You're a lover.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.330
(SNORTS) Ah!

18:35.360 --> 18:38.330
How about she steals back Hannibal,
she's so valuable?

18:38.400 --> 18:39.845
- No.
- Why not?

18:39.920 --> 18:42.400
Because he tried to shove
his dick inside my wife.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.891
Any other questions?

18:45.320 --> 18:47.368
(SNORTS) on!

18:48.160 --> 18:49.207
Whoo!

18:51.120 --> 18:53.805
I came up with that college idea months ago.

18:53.880 --> 18:54.927
You said we didn't have the money.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.606
Put on a dress next time.
Maybe I'll listen better.

19:09.720 --> 19:10.926
Fuck.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.360
- Coke dick. Didn't happen.
- Yeah.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.408
You know, I don't even know where Devon is.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.241
She fucking left.

- Thank you. (SNORTS)

19:37.800 --> 19:39.962
- Speak.
- I need you to make an appearance.

Mr. Nasty Shits doesn't like anybody.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.846
I was gonna close my eyes for a minute.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.570
You kissed this frog, not me.

- You fall in love yet?
- I said no hippies.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.281
See all the hairballs out there
holding up the wall?

20:30.360 --> 20:33.648
Lester wrote it on the ad. It said,
"No fucking hippies." This is who showed up.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.326
JULIE: You want guitar players
or you want people who look like you?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.970
Look's part of the act. Don't pretend it ain't.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.485
Go get me a pair of scissors.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.881
Hey, you pick the guy,
I'll chop his fucking hair off.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.644
They're all flat. They're bland toast.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.569
- Bland toast?
- I can't carry the whole thing myself,

20:45.680 --> 20:46.647
and I'm not gonna.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.001
Oh, don't fucking start.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.366
I liked the guy with the hat.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.411
Why don't you ask him for a pint?

20:52.520 --> 20:54.010
Maybe he'll let you tap his winkie.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.163
(LAUGHS) Hey, none of these guys
had any energy?

20:57.240 --> 20:58.366
It's about him feeling it.

but I ain't got to play with them.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.764
Yeah, he don't and I won't.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.410
So maybe we're done.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.411
Okay, look at me.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.326
I love you.

Nonetheless, you don't pick a guy
in the next five minutes,

21:20.400 --> 21:22.368
I'm gonna rip your head off your neck

21:22.440 --> 21:25.091
and put my own fucking guitarist on top of it.

Don't know why I didn't think of that.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.125
Yeah, I don't know why either, frankly.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.204
You can't blow him off. It's lead guitar.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.805
The whole act is about raw emotion.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.565
- If there's no chemistry, how's it gonna work?
- Who's this?

21:45.640 --> 21:49.167
Duck may have been bland onstage,
but he made Kip feel like something special.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.961
These guys come in, they got fancy licks,
they're showing him up.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.129
Maybe we pick a simpler song.
Chuck Berry or something.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.450
Not fucking Buddy Holly.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.286
What?

22:05.480 --> 22:07.005
Let me deal with this guy.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.925
Did you find them?

22:12.840 --> 22:15.730
Yes, but you should just forget it.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.606
What?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.125
She's letting off a little steam.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.851
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What is this shithole?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.730
- You don't have enough money to...
- Fuck that, man.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.881
Tell me what she's doing.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.528
They're downtown. Really high.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.490
Some guys were with them.
I think they were fucking.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.643
What? Why didn't you stop her?

22:36.720 --> 22:40.281
Because if she wants to fuck another man,
who am I to interfere?

22:40.360 --> 22:43.011
Just because you never managed
to get yourself laid doesn't mean...

22:43.080 --> 22:45.447
- Fuck you, man.
- Richie.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.208
We can retrieve her.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.931
So, let's go.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.331
I need a drink first.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.971
And a toot.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.449
That's a good idea.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.131

23:29.720 --> 23:30.926
What are you doing?

How about you just ask?
