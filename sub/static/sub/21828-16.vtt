WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.583
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:04.667 --> 00:06.250
That was for the A-minus, son!

00:06.333 --> 00:08.500
(Traeger) You are like me,
empowered by the gel.

00:08.583 --> 00:10.500
And that gel is mine to control.

00:10.583 --> 00:12.875
(Harris) I was able to drive away
the inventor.

00:12.959 --> 00:16.625
(Traeger) Next time make sure
you destroy the technopath.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.792
(breathing heavily)

00:30.250 --> 00:31.500
I know you're in here.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.291
Just give up.
You won't win this time.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.500
(slowly in deep voice) Walker.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.500
Walker.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.041
Ahh-ah! Ah!

00:41.125 --> 00:43.834
-(Spyder) Uuh! Uuh! Aw!
-(buzzes)

00:43.917 --> 00:46.500
-(laughs)
-Why do I always get eliminated first?

00:46.583 --> 00:48.583
'Cause you always use
that stupid scary voice.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.250
It gives away where you're hiding.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.709
Dude, don't knock my scary voice.

00:51.792 --> 00:55.125
If you wanna scare people,
use your "talk to girls" voice.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.375
That's freaky.

00:56.458 --> 00:58.166
-Mmph!
-(laser firing)

00:59.417 --> 01:02.041
First rule of Mech Laser Tag,
never let your guard down.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.417
Ha-hah!

01:08.125 --> 01:09.000
Ooh!

01:12.458 --> 01:13.583
(buzzes)

01:13.667 --> 01:14.959
-Aww!
-Ha-ha!

01:15.041 --> 01:18.083
I gotcha! Ya beat!
'Cause your aim stinks!

01:18.166 --> 01:20.250
-Ah...
-I'm surprised you're not moonwalking--

01:20.333 --> 01:21.625
Oh-- No, there it is.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.041
Mm...

01:24.500 --> 01:26.250
Sup, "Y" chromosomes!

01:32.333 --> 01:34.333
Whoo! Ha!

01:35.750 --> 01:36.834
Yeah!

01:36.917 --> 01:38.583
(both buzz)

01:38.667 --> 01:39.709
Bro.

01:39.792 --> 01:42.875
Dang, son, I am the Major of Laser.

01:42.959 --> 01:44.250
The Master of Blasters.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.208
El Ray de los Rays.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.000
As in Ray Beams.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.792
Hey, you can't have two Mech links.

01:51.875 --> 01:53.542
There's no rule that says that.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.542
Don't hate the player.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.458
Hate the fact that you guys just lost.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.625
-Boo!
-Come on, man.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.542
Not cool, Cheater Dinklage.

02:00.625 --> 02:03.333
(sighs) But nice use of loopholes.

02:03.417 --> 02:05.291
No, don't compliment him. He's evil!

02:05.375 --> 02:06.583
Totally evil!

02:06.667 --> 02:08.959
-(whispers) Evil.
-It's messed up.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.709
(Ryan's voice) Evil. Evil.
Totally evil.

02:11.792 --> 02:12.917
Evil. Evil.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.250
Evil. Evil.

02:16.542 --> 02:19.250
-(Traeger) Evil.
-What did I do?

02:21.625 --> 02:23.750
(Traeger) Stop trying to resist.

02:23.834 --> 02:27.250
The residual ooze in your brain
gives me control over you,

02:27.333 --> 02:30.500
as it did when I had you release Grey...

02:35.208 --> 02:37.500
Guess we have to make it
look believable.

02:37.583 --> 02:38.417
Ooh!

02:39.375 --> 02:43.083
(Traeger) ...when you led the team
into my trip in the Arctic.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.875
That last battle damaged me.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.458
You will destroy them
as I heal, and exact my revenge.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.417
Divide them!

02:54.458 --> 02:56.709
And eliminate Ryan when he's alone.

02:57.959 --> 03:01.458
(theme music playing)

03:33.083 --> 03:35.667
(school bell rings)

03:35.750 --> 03:37.375
Mm, it feels sorta weird.

03:37.458 --> 03:38.625
What does?

03:38.709 --> 03:40.917
Mm, Harper gone? Leo a traitor?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.709
Girl in the robot? Big bad destroyed?

03:42.792 --> 03:45.625
Well, when you lay it all out like that,
it's all sorta weird. (laughs)

03:47.125 --> 03:49.959
Gramtag, "Axed by the Axe."

03:50.041 --> 03:52.583
Gramtag, "Axed by the Axe."

03:52.667 --> 03:55.583
Okay, why do you keep
Gramtagging "Axed by the axe"?

03:57.041 --> 03:59.458
"Axed by Boston Axe."

03:59.542 --> 04:00.542
You wanna get in the ring

04:00.625 --> 04:02.959
with the angriest guy
in Ultimate Knuckle Crunching?

04:03.041 --> 04:05.834
Uhhh, yeah. It-- It's a contest.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.458
You learn a few moves from Boston Axe,

04:07.542 --> 04:09.291
you get in the ring and you spar with him,

04:09.375 --> 04:11.542
and they give you a video
of the fight, GramTag

04:11.625 --> 04:13.542
and you get another chance
every time you GramTag

04:13.625 --> 04:14.792
"Axed by the Axe,"

04:14.875 --> 04:17.583
and I've been doing it
for a while now, so...

04:17.667 --> 04:19.166
Define "a while."

04:19.709 --> 04:21.583
Fire! Give me some heat!

04:22.792 --> 04:25.542
(Spyder) GramTag, "Axed by the Axe."

04:25.625 --> 04:26.875
(growling)

04:28.000 --> 04:29.834
Aaugh! Aahh...

04:29.917 --> 04:31.250
Uhh, it's been a while.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.291
But I'm sure it al--
never almost got you killed.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.542
Wow.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.458
Harris?

04:41.542 --> 04:42.500
Harris?

04:44.125 --> 04:47.417
Think of it as Harris 2.0.

04:47.500 --> 04:52.291
As in, "Too bad I can't be Harris,"
and "Oh, he's so cool."

04:52.375 --> 04:54.291
(mimics sizzle) Ahhh!

04:54.375 --> 04:56.250
(laughing) New look.

04:56.333 --> 05:00.000
Hey! Oh, where's the rest
of your vampire boy band, I--

05:00.083 --> 05:01.417
I don't see them anywhere.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.750
Nice.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.083
New glasses, right?

05:05.041 --> 05:06.166
They look good on you.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.208
Okay. A compliment?

05:09.166 --> 05:10.291
No weak attempt at a comeback?

05:10.375 --> 05:12.792
Of course not.
We're friends now, right?

05:12.875 --> 05:15.000
Hold on, let me get back to you, bro.

05:15.083 --> 05:18.375
(Wade) I'm talkin' to you.
I cheat off you, and I got a C-minus.

05:18.458 --> 05:19.917
This is all your fault!

05:20.000 --> 05:22.917
Ooh... so not only
are you bad at math,

05:23.000 --> 05:24.166
but you're bad at cheating.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.959
Ha! You spelled Wade "Wad."

05:26.041 --> 05:27.000
What are you doing?

05:27.083 --> 05:28.041
Aagh-- (grunting)

05:28.125 --> 05:30.166
-Apologize.
-I'm sorry.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.625
Ohhh!

05:31.709 --> 05:32.667
What?

05:33.709 --> 05:35.000
Don't stop dreamin', kid.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.125
Dude, what's going on with you?

05:37.208 --> 05:40.291
We took out Traeger.
The drones are looking for Grey,

05:40.375 --> 05:42.959
and if they find her,
we'll be ready for her.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.458
Own the moment, son.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.208
I like Harris 2.0.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.875
(students) Varsity rules!

06:03.542 --> 06:05.250
-Tough, right?
-(gasps)

06:05.333 --> 06:07.834
Look at them, thinking
they're all... awesome.

06:07.917 --> 06:09.000
Do you miss it?

06:09.083 --> 06:10.834
(scoffs) I'm still awesome.

06:10.917 --> 06:15.709
No, I mean people seeing
you're awesome, knowing you are.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.000
Is this going somewhere hurtful?

06:18.083 --> 06:21.417
Not at all. You and Ryan,
Spyder and Veracity

06:21.500 --> 06:23.041
had my back when I was injured.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.959
So I thought,
"What can I do for my friends?"

06:26.041 --> 06:29.333
Like, how can we get
Mark Walker back to being...

06:29.417 --> 06:31.583
"Mark Walker"?

06:32.583 --> 06:35.333
-So I did something about it.
-Ugh, what did you do ?

06:35.417 --> 06:38.792
Walker! Somebody sent me this.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.083
-(phone beeps)
-Is that you?

06:44.542 --> 06:47.083
-Uhh...
-Hm?

06:47.792 --> 06:48.875
Yeah?

06:49.917 --> 06:52.542
I have coached dance
for the past 10 years,

06:52.625 --> 06:55.417
and those are the best moves
I have ever seen.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.250
-Oh.
-Where was this filmed?

06:58.083 --> 07:00.875
Oh-- Um, I... ooh, uh...

07:00.959 --> 07:03.792
-I, uh--
-Just some underground teen club

07:03.875 --> 07:06.208
where all the best dancers
in town compete.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.625
(whispers) This guy.

07:07.709 --> 07:10.709
The timing is perfect.
Our dance team is weak.

07:10.792 --> 07:13.458
State is coming up.
Are you interested?

07:13.542 --> 07:15.417
(sing song) The trophies are big-ger.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.959
-Yeah?
-I'm interested.

07:17.041 --> 07:17.875
Yes!

07:18.583 --> 07:22.208
Tryouts... after school... don't be late.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.375
Gramtag, "Axed by the Axe."

07:30.458 --> 07:31.709
Gramtag, "Axed by the Axe."

07:31.792 --> 07:33.750
Spyder! You don't think I got this?

07:37.041 --> 07:42.500
(heavy metal music playing)

07:45.000 --> 07:46.417
Spyder!

07:46.500 --> 07:48.542
I'm callin' you out!

07:49.875 --> 07:52.125
Harris? What did you do?

07:52.208 --> 07:55.125
Ran a bot that's been
Gramtagging him for weeks.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.041
No way you were gonna lose.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.333
Plus I added
a random insult generator

07:59.417 --> 08:01.291
just to make sure
it got his attention.

08:01.375 --> 08:02.834
You!

08:05.709 --> 08:08.041
You the kid that's sayin'
he's gonna punch me so hard,

08:08.125 --> 08:10.542
it's gonna knock off
my mother's mustache?

08:13.208 --> 08:14.709
(voice breaks) Apparently.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.875
Excellent use of smack talk, kid.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.000
Right.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.208
-(angry noise)
-(whimpers)

08:21.291 --> 08:24.208
Don't do it... again!

08:24.291 --> 08:25.125
Right.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.500
I'll see you in the ring!

08:32.875 --> 08:34.500
I-- I gotta go finish my will.

08:34.583 --> 08:38.291
I'm gonna get
my butt kicked by a star! Whoo!

08:38.375 --> 08:39.625
Hey! Yo!

08:39.709 --> 08:40.709
Can I talk to you?

08:40.792 --> 08:42.500
Sure. O-- Okay.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.709
Empty?

08:44.792 --> 08:47.000
I sort of released a virus
on all the computers

08:47.083 --> 08:48.583
so that you and I could talk alone.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.000
I know what's going on here.
You're not fooling me.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.667
(Traeger) She knows.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.208
Please, enlighten me.

09:01.166 --> 09:05.667
Acceptance to London Academy
for Women in Science?

09:06.250 --> 09:07.291
No follow-up interviews?

09:07.375 --> 09:11.208
Multiple references on my behalf
that I didn't even request?

09:11.959 --> 09:13.709
You were trying to get me
into this school.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.583
I thought you wanted to go.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.667
(scoffs) Of course I do.

09:17.750 --> 09:21.500
Th-- their-- their campus
is literally modeled after Hogwarts.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.083
They have a dorm called Ravenpuff.

09:23.166 --> 09:26.125
And the ratio of girls
who graduate who get the Noble Prize

09:26.208 --> 09:27.667
is, like, one to one.

09:28.250 --> 09:32.417
So I wondered,
why were you helping me?

09:33.917 --> 09:34.875
And then I figured it out.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.417
You want me gone.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.875
(Traeger) She knows!
You must act. Now!

09:41.959 --> 09:43.500
I don't want your spot on the team.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.333
I was only on defense while you
were getting better, okay?

09:46.417 --> 09:49.250
So you don't have to make up
this elaborate scheme to get rid of me.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.709
That's silly.
With the monsters gone,

09:51.792 --> 09:53.375
Bay City doesn't have
many challenges

09:53.458 --> 09:55.333
for someone
of your intellectual caliber.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.458
That school does.

09:57.542 --> 10:00.041
You're
a remarkable person, Veracity,

10:00.125 --> 10:03.166
but you need higher hurdles
to become the best version of yourself.

10:03.750 --> 10:07.166
You can stay if you want.
We can share shields, no bigs.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.458
This school's my dream!

10:18.125 --> 10:20.709
And I'm pretty sure
that Mech-X4 is yours.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.750
I'd be a pretty terrible frenemy
if I didn't pick up on that.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.041
So?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.500
Droppin' out, I'm movin' up.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.792
Next time you see me, I'll be shattering
the glass ceiling, so...

10:30.542 --> 10:31.458
if you need me...

10:32.166 --> 10:35.041
Oh... I'll know where to find you.

10:35.125 --> 10:39.375
Oh, and until then...
take care of those idiot boys, okay?

10:39.458 --> 10:43.291
Without a big brain on their side,
they are ea-aasy pickings.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.625
She was the smartest.
She was the threat to the plan.

10:50.709 --> 10:53.458
(Traeger) And now, she's gone.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.166
The rest won't see what's coming.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.291
-(school bell ringing)
-Veracity's just gone?

11:00.375 --> 11:01.208
Boom? Like that?

11:01.291 --> 11:04.208
She's been eyeing this school
her whole life. She deserves it.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.625
But Grey's still out there.

11:05.709 --> 11:09.291
I'm checking the drone feed
every half hour. Nothing yet.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.625
In the meantime, just chill.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.083
I'll tell you if I see anything.

11:14.834 --> 11:15.917
(phone beeps)

11:21.125 --> 11:23.417
All right, guys.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.000
Let's bust some moves.

11:25.625 --> 11:29.125
(dance music playing)

11:32.792 --> 11:36.834
♪ It's a celebration
Gonna have a good time ♪

11:36.917 --> 11:39.166
(Principal Dent) No, no! Gone, go.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.750
Please! Thank you!

11:40.834 --> 11:43.333
♪ Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh ♪

11:43.417 --> 11:45.583
No, no, Margaret, no!

11:47.709 --> 11:48.792
Yeah!

11:51.041 --> 11:52.875
Yeah, this is it!

11:54.709 --> 11:56.500
Yes, yes!

11:56.583 --> 11:58.291
You are in!

11:58.375 --> 12:00.709
-Ha-ha!
-Whooo!

12:00.792 --> 12:04.709
And you, Dane! You're his hype man!

12:04.792 --> 12:06.250
-Uhh.
-Ahh!

12:06.333 --> 12:08.458
-Just like old times!
-(both laughing)

12:08.542 --> 12:10.583
And we start right now,

12:10.667 --> 12:13.208
so it's very big time commitment.

12:13.291 --> 12:16.000
Make sure... you're sure.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.083
Whoo-hoo!

12:23.834 --> 12:25.083
Congratulations.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.250
I don't know.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.583
I gave up varsity
because of our... responsibilities.

12:29.667 --> 12:30.917
Dude, it's like Harris said.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.291
We took out Traeger,
do something for you.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.667
I'm about to hit the skate park myself.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.959
Awesome. Thanks, dude.

12:41.083 --> 12:41.917
Whoa!

12:42.709 --> 12:44.875
Aww, Dane,
what-- what are you doin'?

12:44.959 --> 12:49.917
(heavy metal music playing)

12:56.625 --> 12:59.500
Look... we both know
if I threw an actual punch,

12:59.583 --> 13:00.709
I'd break you in half.

13:00.792 --> 13:04.417
Ohh! Just like you did
with that pacifist at the charity event?

13:04.500 --> 13:05.583
(whimpers)

13:05.667 --> 13:07.542
First I'm gonna show you
some moves.

13:07.625 --> 13:09.583
-(muffled grunt)
-Part of the prize is a vid of you...

13:09.667 --> 13:10.667
"fighting me."

13:10.750 --> 13:12.834
-Right.
-So you need to pay attention...

13:12.917 --> 13:14.917
-Okay.
-...or you'll die.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.125
Okay. Okay.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.875
-I'm gonna come at you like this.
-Okay.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.583
-You're going to dodge.
-Okay.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.208
Then you gonna
throw your legs up around my head.

13:22.291 --> 13:25.417
I'll catch you... rotate you, and...

13:25.500 --> 13:26.750
boom!

13:27.542 --> 13:29.542
I made it seem like
you took down the toughest guy

13:29.625 --> 13:31.041
in Ultimate Knuckle Crunching.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.709
(laughs) Ahh. Kinda

13:35.583 --> 13:37.750
wanted this to be real,
though, you know?

13:37.834 --> 13:39.667
Trust me. You don't.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.667
-Right.
-Let's go, people!

13:41.750 --> 13:43.166
-(bell rings)
-Okay.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.166
This is one round, knock down wins.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.375
-Heh-ha!
-I'd tell you to keep it clean,

13:47.458 --> 13:49.500
-but-- (chuckles) come on.
-Oh.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.458
All right.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.333
Yah-- Aah!

13:52.417 --> 13:53.583
-Ow!
-(growls)

13:53.667 --> 13:55.709
Whew.

13:55.792 --> 13:59.291
-Fighter, you ready?
-Come on! Mmmm!

13:59.375 --> 14:00.750
Fighter, you ready?

14:00.834 --> 14:03.625
-Yeah! I finished my will.
-(bell rings)

14:03.709 --> 14:05.250
(crowd shouting)

14:05.333 --> 14:08.834
-(text ping)
-Are you still Gramtaggin'?

14:08.917 --> 14:10.208
No, what?

14:10.291 --> 14:13.542
-(beeping)
-(growls)

14:13.625 --> 14:16.667
So you didn't send this photo
of my mom with a mustache?

14:16.750 --> 14:17.750
No, no, what do you--

14:17.834 --> 14:19.792
-What do you mean, no, I--
-This isn't you?

14:19.875 --> 14:21.500
-That's not me.
-(growls)

14:21.583 --> 14:22.709
No, no, no, no, no!

14:22.792 --> 14:24.208
-No, no.
-Okay.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.208
-No.
-You wanted this to get real?

14:26.291 --> 14:29.792
-It just got real! (growls)
-(crunching phone)

14:29.875 --> 14:31.500
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:31.583 --> 14:32.792
This is a big misunderstanding!

14:32.875 --> 14:34.375
-Aaaahh!
-(growling)

14:34.458 --> 14:35.834
(screams)

14:35.917 --> 14:40.250
Ah! Ah! Oh-- Oh, thank you,
only belt I own.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.792
Whoa, ahhh, ahhh!

14:42.875 --> 14:44.291
Whoa!

14:44.375 --> 14:45.959
Oh, boy, here he goes.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.917
Ahhhh... aaah!

14:54.625 --> 14:57.125
(animal noises)

15:00.959 --> 15:03.375
(animal noises)

15:03.458 --> 15:05.250
Harris. Harris.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.333
(startled noise)

15:06.417 --> 15:07.583
Oh-- Sorry. Sorry.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.625
So, the drone spotted Grey
way up here?

15:10.709 --> 15:13.041
Yeah. Somewhere in the caverns.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.625
That's why we gotta go in on foot.

15:14.709 --> 15:17.917
Maybe, uh, maybe we should wait,
get Spyder and Mark out here.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.125
(scoffs) Ryan, she might
be gone by then.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.208
Besides,
we got antidote darts, arm cannons.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.542
You and me, buddy,
we can take her out.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.375
Yeah, you're right.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.583
Traeger says goodbye.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.291
Traeger says goodbye.

15:46.959 --> 15:49.083
Gravity pucks in my kicks.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.583
Figured I might need 'em.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.166
You can come out now, guys.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.917
(Harris) You're all supposed
to be gone.

16:01.000 --> 16:01.959
Distracted!

16:02.041 --> 16:03.834
-Changed my mind.
-I told the principal

16:03.917 --> 16:05.417
I needed a day
to stretch out my hammies.

16:05.500 --> 16:09.083
And I sorta had to run for my life,
so... the timing worked out.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.375
How did you figure it out?

16:10.458 --> 16:12.417
I'll field that one, Volde-short.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.458
So I wanted to leave you
a thank-you gift for being so "wonderful,"

16:16.542 --> 16:19.291
so I decided to hack into your computer
and upgrade it for you.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.417
But guess what I found?
The deleted footage

16:21.500 --> 16:24.000
from when Leo was trying
to blow up the robot.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.625
But it wasn't Leo.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.375
It was you.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.917
We all thought that you didn't
have enough time to set the explosive.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.417
Harris has got some
pretty mad jumping skills

16:33.500 --> 16:35.166
when he's all hopped up on evil.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.875
Something's wrong with you.
Let us help you.

16:38.959 --> 16:42.792
Harris, hey... once we get you back
to the robot and Harris checks you out,

16:42.875 --> 16:45.834
I'm sure we can help you--
wait. Wait!

16:46.625 --> 16:48.625
Something seems
not right about that.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.208
Come on.

16:51.291 --> 16:54.875
Traeger... help me do your will.

16:54.959 --> 16:58.792
This will take
all my remaining strength.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.083
He's talking to Traeger?

17:00.166 --> 17:01.125
Traeger's alive?

17:01.208 --> 17:03.750
-(grunting)
-(Traeger) But take this power.

17:03.834 --> 17:07.583
-(growling)
-Take the power I am sending you.

17:07.667 --> 17:12.083
-(growling)
-And destroy them all!

17:12.166 --> 17:13.250
What the what is that?

17:13.333 --> 17:16.250
I heard stories.
But I never thought it was real.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.500
That's Monster Harris.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.000
(roaring)

17:20.083 --> 17:20.917
(screams)

17:22.166 --> 17:23.417
(Mark) A little help here.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.208
(growling)

17:31.917 --> 17:33.166
(roars)

17:35.750 --> 17:37.458
(growling)

17:38.583 --> 17:39.792
Yaah!

17:41.417 --> 17:42.250
Uugh!

17:43.959 --> 17:45.375
(growls)

17:59.083 --> 18:00.542
Here you go.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.542
No, I don't need protecting!

18:02.625 --> 18:05.542
But we do, and we need at least one big
brain to survive if Traeger's back.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.917
-(growling)
-Aaah!

18:08.000 --> 18:09.208
-(growling)
-(grunting)

18:09.291 --> 18:10.166
Aah!

18:12.417 --> 18:14.417
And besides, Harris
is my best friend.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.417
-He'd never do anything--
-(screams)

18:18.125 --> 18:19.375
(growling)

18:20.500 --> 18:22.792
Uhh! Uhh!

18:22.875 --> 18:24.750
Where did you learn that?

18:24.834 --> 18:26.458
It's a long story.

18:26.542 --> 18:27.834
It ends in a restraining order.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.458
All right, there's gotta be some way
to reshape the energy in this force field.

18:32.542 --> 18:33.750
(Spyder) Hey! Hold him down!

18:33.834 --> 18:35.417
Harris! Snap out of it!

18:35.500 --> 18:36.667
Aaaah-ohh!

18:36.750 --> 18:37.917
Harris!

18:43.166 --> 18:45.583
(growling)

18:45.667 --> 18:47.291
Harris?

18:47.375 --> 18:48.875
You lied to me!

18:50.166 --> 18:52.667
I thought we were finally friends!

18:57.208 --> 18:59.875
(growling)

19:02.542 --> 19:05.375
But the whole time it was a trick!

19:05.458 --> 19:09.875
(emphatically)
And I don't like to be...

19:13.834 --> 19:15.125
tricked!

19:23.250 --> 19:24.208
Dang.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.542
(Harris grunting)

19:39.750 --> 19:42.000
(breathing heavily)

19:43.875 --> 19:46.208
We were really lucky
that you warned us about Harris.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.000
We would've been dead.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.458
You okay, V?

19:54.542 --> 19:56.583
Hm? Yeah, no, I'm fine.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.375
No. Sorry, I'm not.

20:01.458 --> 20:03.834
(grunting)

20:04.750 --> 20:06.417
(sighs)

20:06.500 --> 20:10.000
Harris did something
really, really sweet for me today.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.208
That should've tipped me off that
something was wrong.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.000
Oh, V, he cares about you.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.291
He cares about all of us.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.875
(grunting)

20:22.750 --> 20:24.750
I hate seeing him like this.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.166
(grunts)

20:32.667 --> 20:33.709
What do we do now?

20:35.375 --> 20:37.000
We get our friend back,

20:37.625 --> 20:39.417
and we make Traeger pay!

20:41.375 --> 20:43.291
Aaaaah!

20:50.375 --> 20:51.667
The winner!

20:51.750 --> 20:52.709
Yeah!

20:54.250 --> 20:57.041
I'm gonna grind you up
and turn you into mulch!

20:57.917 --> 21:00.333
-(referee) Run!
-(Spyder) Soon as I get my video.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.959
What? Ohhh, shoot!

21:03.041 --> 21:06.125
I really wanted to see
that kid get his butt kicked.

21:06.208 --> 21:08.917
(buzzing noise)

21:14.667 --> 21:17.917
Morris! Oh-ho... whoo!

21:18.000 --> 21:19.750
You cannot sneak up
on me like that.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.542
I gotta say being
the most wanted man on Earth

21:22.625 --> 21:24.375
can make you
a little jumpy, heh.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.542
Took me a while to find
this place.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.875
Yeah. You didn't bring a pizza
or anything, did you?

21:29.917 --> 21:32.917
Oh, uh, well, come on.
We got to work to do.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.166
There is a game changer out there.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.417
We have to find Traeger
and Grey.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.250
Not a problem. They found me.

21:42.083 --> 21:42.917
What?

21:45.917 --> 21:48.083
(screaming)

21:55.333 --> 21:56.875
(deep voice) Take me to Traeger.

22:03.417 --> 22:08.250
(theme music playing)
