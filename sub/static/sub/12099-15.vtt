Now, Chester, I do need
to speak to you.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.631
Oh, Jess, I could still die.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.034

I didn't even know who you were

11:19.845 --> 11:23.348
when I was...
sleeping with Mary.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.350
Really, I didn't even know
your name.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.852
I thought it was Jennifer.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.856
I did. I thought
your name was Jennifer.

11:31.857 --> 11:36.327
Chester, you married me. You
married me without loving me,

11:36.328 --> 11:38.630
and that's really
the awful part.

But I fell in love
with you, Jess. I did.

You're right, not at first.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.906
At first, I thought
you were a nice piece,

11:47.907 --> 11:50.309
and if I had to get married,
well, I could do a lot worse.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.181
Always the romantic.

11:56.182 --> 12:00.018
But I fell in love with you,
Jess. I swear I did.

12:00.019 --> 12:03.955
Chester, you certainly had
peculiar ways of showing it.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.457
Why, because I cheated?

12:06.459 --> 12:12.464
Well, Jess, I'll always cheat.
I can't help it.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.465
I cheated on you.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.968
I cheated on the women
I cheated on you with.

12:16.969 --> 12:17.970
I'll cheated on Annie.

Doesn't mean
that I didn't love you.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.378
Guess I always will.

to love me, Chester?

Very quickly, and very easily.

for forgiveness.

No.

I cannot forgive Mary.

21:26.885 --> 21:27.885
Uh, no, you don't.

21:27.886 --> 21:28.886
They take master charge.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.358
I'm a cop, Gwen.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.826
I should always have my gun.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.828
No, it's too dangerous.
You'll get hurt.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.830
No guns,
not on your first day home.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.832
Just one day without a gun,
okay?

21:41.833 --> 21:43.334
Okay.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.341
Go get us a nice car.

21:54.846 --> 21:55.846
See ya.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.348
See you.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.353
You did just fine, Gwenny.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.855
Don't make me do this.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.357
Sorry, Gwenny,

22:06.358 --> 22:08.359
but if Sheriff Campbell
is gonna fight crime,

22:08.360 --> 22:09.360
we gotta know how.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.861
We gotta get him first.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.863
And what better way to get info

22:12.864 --> 22:15.366
than from the good sheriff's
daughter-in-law.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.368
I hate you.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.369
Be nice, Gwenny.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.371
And do like I say.

22:20.372 --> 22:24.876
And maybe it will be a long time
till death do you part.

22:39.424 --> 22:42.893
