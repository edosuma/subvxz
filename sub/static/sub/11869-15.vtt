00:01.919 --> 00:03.625
FARGO: Astraeus Mission
update!

00:03.754 --> 00:05.585
Phase Two of the
Astraeus Mission wraps up

00:05.714 --> 00:06.829
with our
candidates surpassing

00:06.965 --> 00:08.705
even the highest
of physical standards.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.833
The selection
process continues.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.426
On to Phase Three,
psychological analysis.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.886
And thanks to
all Eureka residents

00:15.015 --> 00:17.677
for making the
planetary protection
protocol inoculation

00:17.809 --> 00:19.140
a huge success.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.679
You can never be
too careful because

00:20.812 --> 00:23.349
who knows
what new discoveries
await us on Titan.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.814
The clock is set,
time marches on.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.353
Titan, here we come!

00:28.820 --> 00:30.321
ALLISON: Previously on
Eureka...

00:30.447 --> 00:31.812
You've already
found someone new.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.318
He's funny and so hot.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.946
JO: Her new guy is my old guy.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.827
I had to get it
out of my system.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.537
Yeah, well watch it.
There are other
people involved.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.247
Other female people
like my daughter.

00:42.668 --> 00:43.828
My name is
Beverly Barlow.

00:43.961 --> 00:44.916
CARTER: She's back.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.285
BEVERLY: There are
thousands of us.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.332
Scientists,
politicians, thinkers.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.707
We're the watchdogs
working to control
scientific developments.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.095
The plan's
already in motion.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.677
And everyone
has a part to play.

00:57.099 --> 00:58.088
Hello, Allison.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.140
CARTER: So Allison's a threat.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.887
CARTER: They said
you ran some sort
of scan on yourself.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.430
What did you find?

01:08.986 --> 01:10.021
Nothing.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.018
It's just, work's been...

01:12.155 --> 01:13.565
Crazy.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.190
But I am feeling
much better now, Jack.

01:22.708 --> 01:25.700
ALLISON: I really appreciate
you taking the kids, Mom.

01:25.836 --> 01:26.916
(LAUGHS)

01:27.045 --> 01:31.004
Yes, Kevin has
been looking fon/vard to
being spoiled by his nana.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.752
Jenna, yeah, I know
she can be a handful

01:36.888 --> 01:39.140
so don't take
your eye off of her.

01:39.933 --> 01:45.473
Nap time, well, you know,
whenever she seems tired.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.147
Uh-huh.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.363
Tragic.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.403
What? Oh, no, no Mother,

01:59.536 --> 02:02.118
it's just a
stray dog outside.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.780
Yeah.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.288
Nothing to write
home about.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.497
Hmm.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.763
Yes, Mother, I will
talk to you later.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.596
Okay. Kiss
the kids for me.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.390
I love you too.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.645
Bye.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.765
Hmm.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.643
Yeah, I think this'll do.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.619
I'll see you guys
in a second.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.498
Hey! I should
arrest you for
disturbing the peace.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.121
Ooh, well, that
sounds like fun.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.713
Yeah. I thought
you were going to
come over last night.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.503
I sent you a text.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.002
Are you sure you
did that right?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.921
No. Not really.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.476
No, but I miss you.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.593
I feel like we've been
a little out of sync.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.061
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.774
Things have just
been crazy with the
Astraeus Mission testing.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.233
Senator Wen is
coming in from Salem

03:15.362 --> 03:17.068
for the official
hand-off of G.D.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.653
And how's your head?

03:18.782 --> 03:19.942
Oh, it's fine.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.825
I can't believe
Fargo's giving up
running G.D.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.069
for a chance
to go to Titan.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.820
I mean they don't
have cable there.

03:26.957 --> 03:30.370
That would be true,
but the transfer's
only temporary,

03:30.502 --> 03:31.867
othenNise I wouldn't
have taken the job.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.618
Really? You're
telling me you're not
a little bit excited

03:33.755 --> 03:35.131
about being
big cheese again?

03:35.257 --> 03:36.212
Maybe just a little.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.718
Yeah, well, don't let
the power go to your head.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.300
I will do my best.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.669
Got to go.
I will see you tonight.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.716
Yeah, promises, promises.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.339
Bye, Carter.
Bye.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.800
Jack.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.517
Old habit.
Right.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.637
(ENGINE REVVING)

03:56.278 --> 03:58.439
Girlfriend's looking good.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.654
Everything okay?

04:00.782 --> 04:03.774
Uh, I hope so.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.322
I heard Zoe's coming
back into town for a visit.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.696
Yeah, it's a bit
unexpected, but
Jo's picking her up.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.038
What?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.748
Uh, that's...
That's not good.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.993
Oh, what... What
have you done now?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.290
Nothing. But from
what Pilar says

04:16.423 --> 04:19.540
I don't think we're her
two favorite people right now.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.675
Hey!

04:26.850 --> 04:29.512
Hey stranger.
Welcome home.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.054
I thought my dad
was picking me up.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.428
He, uh... He was,

04:32.564 --> 04:34.896
but I thought it would
be fun to catch up
on the drive home.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.811
I want to
hear everything.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.774
Yeah, that makes two of us.

04:38.904 --> 04:39.984
Shall we?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.532
Thanks for calling
the hospital, Henry.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.577
It's just that
something's not right.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.416
She did have an accident.
Yeah, she's not herself.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.957
You know the headaches
and... And... ljust...

04:58.089 --> 04:59.340
You know I think Grace
has more experience

04:59.466 --> 05:01.252
with those feelings
than I do. I mean...
Yeah.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.467
In our case, you know,
I just wasn't myself.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.638
(LAUGHING)

05:08.767 --> 05:10.382
Wormhole humor?
Sorry.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.479
Uh, I'm still on hold.
Yeah.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.848
It doesn't help that
Zane's PALs system

05:17.984 --> 05:19.235
identified her
as a security threat.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.726
Well, let'sjust see
what we find. Yes, hello?

05:20.862 --> 05:23.569
Yes, this is
Doctor Henry Deacon.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.781
You treated
a patient of mine
on the seventh,

05:26.910 --> 05:28.070
Allison Blake.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.818
Uh, she had a car accident.

05:29.955 --> 05:33.413
I need to transfer
her records for
follow-up treatment.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.744
Really?

05:36.795 --> 05:37.705
Well, that's concerning.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.830
Uh, no, but
thanks for your help.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.422
It's bad, isn't it?

05:42.968 --> 05:45.459
Subdural hematoma?
Or, pheochromocytoma?
Concussion?

05:45.595 --> 05:47.301
There was a House
marathon on last night.

05:47.430 --> 05:51.048
There's nothing.
There is no record
of her at all.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.924
Did she go to
a different hospital?

05:53.061 --> 05:55.552
He said that's the
only hospital in the area.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.351
They didn't treat any
accident victims that day,

05:58.483 --> 06:00.314
and he was
absolutely positive.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.728
That doesn't make sense.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.477
She had memory loss
even to the point

06:03.613 --> 06:05.524
where she had
to scan herself
when she got back.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.774
Do you know the results?
No, no, she wouldn't
say anything, so.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.947
They would be
in her G.D. files.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.787
I know, which
I know... I know...

06:14.916 --> 06:16.702
Well, then you also
know the only way
to access

06:16.835 --> 06:18.826
G.D. medical records
is in the infirmary.

06:18.962 --> 06:23.205
Funny thing,
Allison's taking over
for Fargo today.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.457
She won't be
in the infirmary.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.722
All right, um,
let me see what I can do.

06:29.848 --> 06:34.217
Oh, and, um, do you have
your... The MRI pen
scanny thing.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.889
Oh, yeah, Jo has it.
It's in her office.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.104
Where you headed?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.975
Uh, I need to go
take a closer look
at the accident site.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.818
A really close look.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.740
Okay, just need to
type in my master code.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.863
And I'll no longer be
director of G.D.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.614
Then we should
get to it.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.991
Right.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.744
Just a few
keystrokes away

07:03.840 --> 07:06.582
and it's back to being
Joe Citizen for me.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.084
Yep. Here we go.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.801
Is it hot in here?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.592
Doctor Fargo.

07:12.724 --> 07:13.964
Right.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.017
Okay. That's it.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.979
Doctor Blake, enter
your new code please.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.950
Security code accepted.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.035
Transfer's complete.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.120
I'm officially
a nobody again.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.456
Congratulations,
Doctor Blake.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.497
Until the final
selections are made for
the Astraeus Mission,

07:43.630 --> 07:45.962
you are acting director
of Global Dynamics.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.706
Thank you, Senator Wen.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.754
And I will do my best to
keep things running smoothly

07:50.887 --> 07:51.876
in Doctor Fargo's absence.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.753
Oh, I have no doubt.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.178
Getting this mission
ready to launch
is your top priority.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.891
Of course, Senator.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.769
Oh, someone's
in a hurry.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.984
Oh, no, l was
just heading out.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.362
Without stopping
to see me?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.358
You on a case?
No, ljust borrowed
something from Jo.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.452
Was that,
uh... Senator...
Michaela Wen.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.662
Yes. I'm officially
running this place again.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.244
Congratulations.
Why thank you.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.289
You okay?

08:27.590 --> 08:28.750
Not to worry.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.130
You sure?

08:41.771 --> 08:43.807
I've never been better.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.646
See you later, tiger.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.570
Right.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.325
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

09:10.425 --> 09:13.132
ZANE: You want me to
access Allison's
confidential medical files?

09:13.261 --> 09:16.845
Yes. She had
a CT scan and
we're concerned about her.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.055
We being you and Carter?
Yes.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.800
Classic. I can't apply
for the Astraeus Mission

09:21.936 --> 09:24.097
because of my past felonies
for computer crimes,

09:24.230 --> 09:25.686
but yet every time
I turn around

09:25.815 --> 09:27.225
you guys are asking me
to commit them.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.020
Well, I do see the irony.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.814
Yeah, well, what the hell.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.027
But I can't do that...

09:37.994 --> 09:39.074
Unless I'm in
the infirmary.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.115
Which happens to be
full of people right now.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.989
Which is why
I called you.
Any suggestions?

09:47.712 --> 09:49.373
Viral coding?
What are you doing?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.622
I'm invalidating
the subroutines on
the infirmary computers

09:51.758 --> 09:53.339
with a Rousten
binary worm.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.175
So that they'll need
someone who understands
tertiary codex

09:56.304 --> 09:57.760
to make the repairs.
Yeah.

09:57.889 --> 09:58.844
Who are you
going to call?

09:58.973 --> 10:00.224
You... You're a little
too good at this, I think.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.136
Yeah, I know.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.008
So since we're
doing favors,

10:04.145 --> 10:06.682
can I ask you something
I can't really talk about
with anyone else?

10:06.815 --> 10:11.024
If it has to do with
the mechanics of sexual
activity in zero G, no.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.689
It's not that.
Although now I have
several questions.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.528
(LAUGHING)

10:16.741 --> 10:22.828
Seriously though, um...
After you had your
whole time shift, you know.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.867
When you came back
from 1947...

10:24.999 --> 10:26.455
How did Grace
handle that?

10:27.710 --> 10:30.247
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.457
Mmm.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.343
Uh, not very well.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.060
It's been a process of
getting to know each other.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.725
She again,
me for the first time.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.814
See, why can't Lupo
be like that?

10:51.943 --> 10:55.026
I mean it's not like
I want to dive into a
relationship or anything.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.194
Honestly, waking up
married next to a stranger
is my worst nightmare.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.903
That's not
how I meant it.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.162
It's okay.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.574
It's just I can't
help but feel
a little bit insulted.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.993
I'm notjust some
piece of meat.
I have feelings.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.959
Well, it's a
unique situation.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.625
You can't force it.
You just have
to give it time.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.294
Time.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.387
We're all done here.
What now?

11:25.393 --> 11:27.133
Ah.
Go for Donovan.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.352
Oh, really?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.809
As a matter of fact
I can fix that.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.102
I'm on my way now.
Let's roll.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.103
JO: So, uh, how's school?

11:38.239 --> 11:40.616
Are you still
liking the, uh, the
pre-med program?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.452
Well, I thought I had.
Yeah.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.621
Until you slept with him.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.285
Excuse me?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.660
Zane. How long
have you two been
sleeping together?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.496
Jo, it's a small town.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.298
You went behind
my back, Jo.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.883
You, of all people.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.128
I mean Pilar, sure,
but you're like my sister.

12:03.264 --> 12:07.974
What happened with Zane
started long before
you were ever interested.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.889
I mean you two
hate each other.
It's complicated.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.180
Then why didn't you
say anything when I
told you I liked him?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.477
Because it was over then.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.106
Things took a really,
really drastic turn with us.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.605
Why?
I can't say.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.114
Can't? Or you won't?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.661
HENRY: Hey, Jack.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.121
Hey, Henry.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.081
So, Jack, what did
you find out there?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.667
Nothing. There's no
sign of a crash.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.411
And plus the
Highway Patrol doesn't
have an accident report.

13:18.589 --> 13:19.624
It's like it
neverhappened.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.500
Uh, do you have
Allison's medical scans?

13:23.636 --> 13:26.048
Uh, yeah, with
a little help from Zane.

13:26.180 --> 13:30.093
Now it shows
that there's a radical
change in her CTA.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.059
Cortex telemetric activity.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.848
Really?
Do I have to ask?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.317
Her brain isn't behaving
like her brain.

13:38.443 --> 13:41.856
Okay, Um,
what could cause that?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.979
Well, we're still
analyzing the data,

13:44.115 --> 13:45.195
but you know what,
Jack, you were right,

13:45.325 --> 13:47.281
something's
happened to her.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.947
I'll be right there.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.126
Already back
in the saddle, huh?

13:59.255 --> 14:00.791
You don't
waste any time.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.336
Well, I thought I should
review the status of the
Astraeus Project, you know?

14:04.469 --> 14:07.051
Get up to speed.
I'm also beefing up security

14:07.180 --> 14:10.047
and l have Deputy Andy
getting a program upgrade.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.344
I just want to make sure
everything goes smoothly.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.220
Oh, okay. Well, just
here to get my last
few personal effects.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.557
No, but seriously,

14:20.693 --> 14:22.354
don't hesitate to call me
if you have any questions.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.853
There have been
a few changes since
you were director.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.820
Maybe I'll make some
changes of my own.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.234
(LAUGHING)

14:29.035 --> 14:31.151
No, seriously, don't
mess with my office.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.652
That couch is imported.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.575
Aren't you late
for space training?

14:34.707 --> 14:38.746
I'm going. ljust
want to make sure
you're settled in.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.209
Not too settled.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.578
Goodbye, Fargo.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.632
Imported.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.420
Where'd everyone go?
The computers are down.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.057
Don't ask.
Right.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.923
So, what'd you find?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.049
This.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.604
Tell me those aren't tumors.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.188
No, no, no. I mean
we're not sure,

15:01.317 --> 15:03.399
but we think it's the
same technology as a BMI.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.893
A BMI?
Uh...

15:05.029 --> 15:06.610
Brain-to-machine interfaces.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.650
They were developed
for military pilots
to control aircraft

15:08.783 --> 15:11.320
from the ground
using only their brain.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.030
So you're telling me
that Allison has

15:13.162 --> 15:14.777
the remote control
to an airplane in her...

15:14.914 --> 15:16.154
No, no, no,
she doesn't, no.

15:16.290 --> 15:20.329
This technology is BBI,
brain-to-brain interface.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.168
Someone else could be
controlling her.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.252
She hasn't been
acting like herself.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.751
Because somebody
hacked your girlfriend.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.548
The question is why?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.214
Because she just
became head of
Global Dynamics.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.102
Jack, what are you...
Surprise!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.566
I hope you're hungry.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.154
A picnic. Your text
said it was urgent.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.116
Yes. But I managed
to text successfully

15:53.244 --> 15:56.077
which is
cause for celebration
in and of itself.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.163
And, um, ljust
wanted to spend
some time with you.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.663
And look at the great work
that Vincent did.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.501
Oh, it's so sweet.
Yeah.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.793
But my day
is really crazy.
I can't stay.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.040
Okay.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.634
I can take
a rain check.

16:11.762 --> 16:16.677
But there is one thing

16:16.809 --> 16:19.221
I would like before you go.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.014
What would that be?

16:21.147 --> 16:24.059
I would like to know...
Ah!

16:25.568 --> 16:27.024
What the hell
you've done with
my girlfriend.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.438
What are you
talking about?

16:28.571 --> 16:32.780
Allison Blake.
I've seen the brain scans.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.910
It was just
too tempting.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.001
Oh, was it?
Who are you?

16:45.129 --> 16:47.996
Believe it or not
I am not the bad guy, Jack.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.044
Considering you hijacked
my girlfriend's brain,

16:51.177 --> 16:52.383
I would disagree.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.468
You have a point.
Mmm.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.212
I guess we're
at an impasse.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.055
I guess we are.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.847
Oh, Sheriff, I was
hoping it wouldn't
have to come to this.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.553
Come to what?
Plan B.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.897
(GROANS)

17:15.451 --> 17:17.487
It's always something.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.054
I've cut Eureka off
from the outside world.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.972
That should
buy us some time,
but we have to hurry.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.471
The BB! interface
with Allison becomes
less stable

18:28.608 --> 18:30.064
the longer I use it.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.808
I'd really prefer
not to get stuck
inside her head.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.527
DEKKER: That
would be unfortunate.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.068
What about the Sheriff?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.691
He forced my hand.
I had to use the failsafe.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.740
The nano-sensors
we planted in the
inoculations worked?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.989
Perfectly. Now hurry.
I don't have much time.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.909
You stabbed me
in the back.
I would never.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.458
When you told me
about this great new
guy that you liked,

18:52.590 --> 18:53.830
ifl had known
that it was him,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.048
I never would have
encouraged you.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.634
Even after you found out,
you continued to see him.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.594
No. We weren't
together then.

19:00.723 --> 19:02.133
You just said
it's been years.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.426
Which is it, J0?

19:03.559 --> 19:06.301
Both. On and off.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.428
It's hard to explain.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.976
You know time is
a tricky thing.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.600
You started up again
after you found out
I was interested in him.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.273
This isn't making me
look any better, is it?

19:16.405 --> 19:17.440
No. Not so much.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.030
Look, Zoe, you
have to believe me.
Jo, stop.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.024
Okay, no, not until you,
not until you listen.
No, stop!

19:22.161 --> 19:23.526
(TIRES SCREECHING)

19:32.171 --> 19:33.456
Oh, my God.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.414
Jo, what's happening?
Are they...

19:37.134 --> 19:39.045
I don't know. Come on.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.308
He has a pulse.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.140
Yeah, this one too.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.400
They're alive.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.895
It's like they're in a coma.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.146
What could do this
to the whole town?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.659
I don't know. It's Eureka.
It could be a dozen things.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.492
We need help.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.576
It's dead.

20:11.836 --> 20:12.791
Mine, too.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.332
Eureka has
a secure network with a
fission reactor backup.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.627
It can't go down
unless someone took it
down deliberately.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.251
Jo, where's my dad?

20:27.268 --> 20:28.348
Dad!

20:29.979 --> 20:31.139
Carter?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.687
He's just
like the others.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.522
Jo, what if
it's an outbreak?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.152
We're still all right.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.109
Yeah, but the effects
could be gradual.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.603
I mean there's lots of
viruses that can

20:40.740 --> 20:42.446
paralyze our autonomic
nervous system

20:42.575 --> 20:43.815
and arrest
your respiration and...

20:43.951 --> 20:45.737
Zoe, breathe.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.577
Okay, whatever happened,
happened fast.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.991
We're going to get
through this, okay?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.748
We need to do
some blood work.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.368
Uh, run a chem panel
for toxicology.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.664
You know how to do that?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.038
Sort of. I just
finished my pathology
rotation at school,

20:59.175 --> 21:01.006
so I can work a needle.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.087
Space cocktails.
What?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.384
Allison's been administering
inoculations to everyone

21:08.517 --> 21:09.927
for the
Astraeus Mission.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.641
Okay. Well,
that would explain
why I'm not affected,

21:11.771 --> 21:13.102
but why aren't you?

21:13.230 --> 21:15.437
Oh, well, because
I didn't get mine yet.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.397
I couldn't.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.642
Needles just
freak me out.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.361
Okay, so maybe
they're having
an adverse reaction.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.855
We need to see
what's in the
inoculations.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.106
Okay, we'll get
to the infirmary.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.109
But, uh, in case
we need to split up,

21:28.245 --> 21:31.112
Carter's old school crap
finally comes in handy.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.498
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

21:41.425 --> 21:42.665
That's not one of ours.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.004
Come on!
Jo, wait, no.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.598
lcantleave
without my dad.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.058
Okay, come on.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.565
Dekker, is there a problem?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.781
No. Not at all.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.490
You like what you see?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.781
I must confess
it's a little
disconcerting

22:11.914 --> 22:12.869
seeing you like this.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.159
Well, you should
try being me.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.377
Where's the core chamber?

22:17.503 --> 22:18.834
Section five.

22:19.630 --> 22:20.870
And you're sure that
we can get in?

22:21.841 --> 22:24.253
I'm the new
interim director
of Global Dynamics.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.842
I can go anywhere I want.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.805
Let's go over here.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.093
Oh, God, Zane!

22:35.229 --> 22:37.060
I'm glad he's unconscious.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.520
Can you help me please?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.226
Fine.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.351
I can't believe
this is happening.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.229
I wonder if...
If there's anyone left.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.485
(BEEPING)

22:50.619 --> 22:52.029
Okay, the security log
shows that

22:52.162 --> 22:54.574
Allison activated
the isolation protocols.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.743
Well, so she could
still be awake.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.618
She took over
as interim head
of Global today.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.539
Someone could have
forced her to activate,

23:01.672 --> 23:03.333
like whoever was
flying that helicopter.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.921
We need to help her.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.165
You check the vaccine.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.838
See if you can
come up with
sort of antidote.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.130
I'll try to find Allison

23:09.263 --> 23:10.844
and if she's
still conscious,

23:10.973 --> 23:12.304
maybe she can tell us
what's going on.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.548
And if she's not?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.053
Well, then we're all
Eureka's got.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.142
No pressure there.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.763
Hey, we're going
to figure this out.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.310
Okay? Trust me.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.184
Well, that's
a lot to ask for.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.527
But okay.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.813
Keep your radio on.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.582
(SIGHS) This is it.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.286
COMPUTER: Biometric scan
complete.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.879
Welcome, Doctor Blake.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.465
The master computer core
of Global Dynamics.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.349
ALLISON: Mmm.
DEKKER: You okay?

23:54.475 --> 23:56.136
(GROANS)

23:58.020 --> 24:01.638
Ah! Ah. Yeah, probably
just a side effect
from the implant.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.144
Let's try this again.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.101
COMPUTER: Invalid pass code.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.982
Something is not right.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.151
Without Blake's pass code,
we might as well pack and go.
It's okay.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.946
I think Allison's fighting me,
but there's another way.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.740
I just need to get
to section three.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.113
What's in there?
A laser lab.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.868
We're going to need
a bigger key.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.633
(SIGHS) Please be okay.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.184
What were they looking at?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.485
Allison?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.451
Computer,
what is that?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.161
COMPUTER: Foreign bodies
have been detected

25:00.290 --> 25:01.996
throughout the neocortex.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.518
Ah! Allison!

25:23.647 --> 25:25.979
Jo! Thank God
someone else is awake.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.939
What is going on?
I was about to ask you.

25:28.068 --> 25:31.811
l was in Fargo's office
and suddenly everyone
just collapsed.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.689
It's the same in town.
Look, we could be
under attack.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.156
What... What
makes you say that?

25:36.285 --> 25:37.821
There's a chopper
on the G.D. landing pad.

25:37.953 --> 25:38.942
And it's not
one of ours.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.782
I heard voices
in section three
a few minutes ago.

25:40.914 --> 25:41.994
We need to get
somewhere secure.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.489
We need outside help.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.001
If Eureka's
been compromised...

25:45.127 --> 25:47.618
Why did you trigger
the isolation protocols?

25:47.755 --> 25:49.620
I was trying to
quarantine the town.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.964
Whatever they used
could have been contagious.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.083
Okay, we need
to coordinate
with the Pentagon.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.211
Right now
we're flying blind.

25:57.347 --> 26:01.056
Jo, you're very good
at yourjob.

26:01.643 --> 26:02.723
Allison?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.434
Ah! Ah!

26:08.400 --> 26:09.856
No hard feelings.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.117
Shot with
my own pulse gun.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.039
Locked in my own cell.

26:30.172 --> 26:31.412
Oh.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.800
This is so not right.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.640
Hey, we're making progress.

26:40.766 --> 26:41.972
I don't have
much longer in here

26:42.101 --> 26:43.966
and you need to
start laying in
the computer code.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.639
It's cutting as
fast as it can.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.977
You bring the
transmitter for your end?

26:47.106 --> 26:50.269
No. After all
this preparation
I left it in the car.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.355
Funny.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.022
This'll tap into
G.D.'s data stream and
bounce it directly to us.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.065
It's all coming together.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.153
Your father would be proud.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.897
It's only the first step.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.366
But they'll never
see it coming.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.369
ZOE: Jo? Jo, are you there?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.160
It's Zoe Carter.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.623
The sheriff's daughter?

27:08.752 --> 27:11.164
What's she doing here?
She shouldn't be.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.002
That's a problem.
Not necessarily.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.918
Listen, Jo, I don't know
if you can hear me,

27:15.050 --> 27:17.336
but there's something wrong
with Allison's brain.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.460
How does she know?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.848
Just get that door open
and worry about your part.

27:21.974 --> 27:22.963
I'll handle this.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.969
ALLISON: Zoe, is that you?

27:25.102 --> 27:26.091
Allison?

27:28.438 --> 27:29.564
Hi.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.149
How are you?

27:31.275 --> 27:33.140
Well, the town's
unconscious, so not great.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.183
What are you doing here?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.857
I'm just in town
for the long weekend.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.072
ZOE: So, where's Jo?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.943
Fargo's office.
She's calling in outside help.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.115
So I guess you heard
what I said then?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.660
Zoe, don't worry,
I'm fine, but G.D.'s
been compromised.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.408
Tell me where you are
and I'll come get you.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.210
Hey, you know what?
That's not necessary.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.840
I am actually, I'm good.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.378
She knows you're not Blake.
We need to find her.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.171
She's in the infirmary.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.013
It's a pulse gun.
Don't hurt her.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.053
We only need the data.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.642
I'll do my best.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.686
ZOE: Hey Allison,
can I talk to Jo?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.644
Hang on.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.858
I'm almost in the office.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.069
Oh, no, she's unconscious
like all the others.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.065
Whatever's causing this
must be spreading.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.816
It's just you
and me now, Zoe,

28:23.952 --> 28:25.158
we have to
help each other.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.494
Okay, just
tell me one thing.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.030
Anything.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.207
When is Jenna's birthday?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.041
What?

28:34.171 --> 28:36.127
The date your
daughter was born.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.175
You always were
a clever girl.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.675
A primary narcissist
with serious daddy issues,
but clever.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.088
And you sound
just like my old shrink.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.553
Because I'm perceptive.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.726
But anyone can tell
how scared you are right now.

28:52.856 --> 28:53.936
You're not Allison.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.894
Now you're just
being paranoid.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.436
ZOE: I don't think so.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.604
BEVERLY: I care
about you, Zoe.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.853
And ljust want you
to be safe.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.945
That's why you need
to stay where you are.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.362
My primary narcissism is
going to have to say no.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.160
She's not in here.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.207
Tell your storm trooper
better luck next time,
Beverly.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.213
You are making
a big mistake.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.215
And you're a lousy therapist.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.547
Have it your way.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.056
Lock down her floor.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.023
COMPUTER: Section three
lockdown now in effect.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.063
All personnel have
30 seconds to reach
secure location.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.151
Oh, crap.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.020
COMPUTER: 29...

29:43.156 --> 29:44.566
There's nowhere to run, Zoe.

29:44.700 --> 29:50.036
COMPUTER: 25, 24,
23, 22, 21, 20...

29:50.163 --> 29:51.152
Ah!

29:51.290 --> 29:54.248
COMPUTER: 18,17, 16, 15...

29:54.376 --> 29:55.456
Oh!

29:55.585 --> 29:59.954
COMPUTER: 13, 12, 11, 10...

30:00.090 --> 30:03.457
Nine, eight, seven, six

30:03.593 --> 30:07.757
five, four, three, two, one.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.213
Lockdown complete.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.174
(PANTING)

30:14.396 --> 30:15.602
Perfect.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.107
Hello!

30:18.692 --> 30:19.977
Anybody?

30:22.279 --> 30:25.146
I really should have
put a bathroom in here.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.818
Why did I have the Venti?

30:37.127 --> 30:38.116
Zoe?

30:41.381 --> 30:42.757
Come on out.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.542
I'm not going
to hurt you.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.793
Much.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.094
(THUDDING)

30:59.232 --> 31:00.267
Cute.

31:05.781 --> 31:06.770
Thanks, little guy.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.159
Thank you.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.162
(PANTING)

31:20.045 --> 31:22.127
I'm done playing nice.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.244
Find her.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.417
Zoe? I don't have
time for this.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.963
Hey, Beverly, bite me.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.524
Great. Now what?

32:08.718 --> 32:09.707
We're in.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.470
Every project, plan and
schematic is stored here.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.011
We need to initiate
transmission now.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.884
What about the girl?

32:19.354 --> 32:21.185
Dekker's taking
care of her.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.844
Surprise.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.224
Surprise.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.052
JO: Hello?

33:03.482 --> 33:06.349
God, I hate irony!

33:06.485 --> 33:07.850
Do you need a hand?

33:09.613 --> 33:11.945
Oh, my god, Zoe,
thank God you're okay.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.359
Look, get me out of here.
Allison has gone bug nuts.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.109
It's not Allison.
It's Beverly Barlow.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.030
Beverly? But I...

33:18.163 --> 33:20.370
She put something
in Allison's brain.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.455
Trust me, it's Beverly.

33:22.584 --> 33:23.994
Where's your keypad thing?

33:24.127 --> 33:25.708
Behind Obama.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.589
Okay.
Yeah.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.877
What's the code?
0-2-0-8.

33:35.889 --> 33:36.844
What?

33:36.973 --> 33:38.634
Apologize first.
Are you kidding?

33:38.767 --> 33:40.098
Bigger issues.

33:40.227 --> 33:41.967
Well, then just apologize
and we can move on.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.970
Or what? You're going
to leave me in here?

33:51.238 --> 33:52.227
Thank you.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.104
Do you love him?

33:57.369 --> 33:58.324
I don't know.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.945
When this is
all over find out.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.290
Uh, okay.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.127
Uh-oh. I think
I know where she is.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.747
The core chamber's
been breached.

34:11.883 --> 34:12.872
What's in there?

34:13.009 --> 34:14.124
Every scientific advancement

34:14.261 --> 34:15.671
Eureka's developed
since its inception.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.465
And if she taps into
the data stream.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.178
Eureka's secrets
go bye-bye.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.267
(SIGHS) Yeah.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.053
Not on my watch.

34:23.645 --> 34:28.264
Uh, Jo, you do realize
that hurting Beverly means
hurting Allison too?

34:32.612 --> 34:35.069
Any closer to
a wake-up call
for the town?

34:35.198 --> 34:38.110
Well, the inoculations
contained a synthetic
neurotransmitter.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.450
I think it triggered
a flood of adenosine.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.446
It makes you sleep.
My dad's levels were
just off the chart.

34:44.124 --> 34:45.489
Go Harvard.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.001
I might be able to
disrupt the transmitter,

34:47.127 --> 34:50.085
send out a small
electric charge,
revive everyone.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.082
I'll go find Beverly.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.543
Hey, Jo.
Yeah?

34:54.676 --> 34:55.665
Be careful.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.342
You too.

34:58.972 --> 34:59.961
Stand by.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.721
Tapping into the
core's data stream.

35:16.656 --> 35:20.194
The interface is showing
a dangerous spike in
biocortex activity.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.285
Blake's resisting.
We need to sever the link
or it could become permanent.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.368
BEVERLY: Not yet.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.828
We're almost there.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.119
Remote link active.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.792
Starting transmission.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.125
It's working.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.087
Time to level
the playing field.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.516
You can do this.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.143
You can do this.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.495
Oh!

36:04.621 --> 36:06.031
Boy am I
glad to see you.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.875
Okay, so if I'm correct,

36:12.003 --> 36:13.504
a high-voltage,
low-amperage trigger

36:13.630 --> 36:15.120
should just be enough
to wake my dad up.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.918
And if I'm wrong,

36:19.135 --> 36:21.512
I should really reconsider
this whole doctor thing.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.589
If Zane were awake...

36:25.725 --> 36:29.092
If Zane were awake
he'd hack in and
override the security.

36:30.397 --> 36:33.184
Okay, that's what
I need to do.
Ah, I got to get caught.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.065
Uh. Okay, computer,
do your worst.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.025
Download this, Beverly.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.740
Nice of you two
to show up.

36:52.877 --> 36:53.992
You have her?

36:54.129 --> 36:55.039
No.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.628
She was surprisingly
determined.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.963
So am I.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.333
We just lost
the link.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.800
Looks like a
security response was

37:05.932 --> 37:07.138
triggered by
another computer.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.132
It activated a
complete shutdown.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.134
These people are really
starting to annoy me.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.101
What about the
program code?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.062
Done. We should
get out of here
while we still can.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.146
Did we get all
the files we need?

37:16.276 --> 37:19.018
Well, I can't be certain.
The feed was interrupted.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.690
That's not good enough.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.985
I wanted to get in and out
without anyone knowing
we were ever here.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.824
Since that's no longer
an option we go with
the other approach.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.534
What's that?
Brute force.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.075
I can't stay connected
to Allison much longer.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.822
I'll grab the
black box mirror drive.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.039
Get him to the chopper.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.125
And try not to get
knocked unconscious
on the way.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.169
Keep your circuits crossed.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.969
COMPUTER: Vital signs falling.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.186
No. No.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.565
Dad, this isn't happening.
COMPUTER: Vital signs falling.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.980
Dad! Dad!
No, no, no, no, no.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.853
Dad!
COMPUTER: Vital signs falling.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.940
Dad! Dad!

38:09.788 --> 38:11.449
Dad.
COMPUTER: Vital
signs critical.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.912
Please don't die.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.744
COMPUTER: Vital
signs stabilizing.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.458
I'm sorry.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.457
I'm so sorry.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.746
COMPUTER: Vital
signs stabilized.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.182
This is very bad.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.519
Zoe, I kicked Beverly
out of the system

38:33.645 --> 38:34.760
but she took
the core hard drive.

38:34.896 --> 38:35.885
I'm going after her.

38:36.356 --> 38:37.436
Jo, I can't do this.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.895
I almost lost him.
I don't know
what I'm doing.

38:41.027 --> 38:41.982
Yes, you do.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.227
Just breathe.
Talk to me.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.695
Tell me
what's happening.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.735
The inoculations
everyone had

38:47.867 --> 38:49.653
triggered the reflex
that put them to sleep.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.118
Have you, uh, tried
to un-trigger it?

38:52.247 --> 38:54.613
Yes. I thought that
I could short them out
but it didn't work.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.455
And if that's not it...

38:59.128 --> 39:01.744
Wait, you said that you
kicked Beverly out of
the computer system.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.212
Yeah, I hacked in
and triggered the alarm.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.877
G.D.'s security
did the rest.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.545
Well, maybe I can
do the same thing
to my dad.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.169
Instead of trying
to shut down the
neurotransmitters,

39:09.305 --> 39:11.921
I need to trigger his
brain's natural functions
to wake him up.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.765
Okay, well, you lost me,
but sounds great.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.306
The real neurotransmitter,
adenosine.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.349
A small overdose
might fool my dad's
neural system

39:19.482 --> 39:20.983
into kick-starting itself.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.934
That a girl.
You can do this.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.856
Okay, now go
get that bitch.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.030
Don't move!

39:39.252 --> 39:40.287
Or what, Jo?

39:41.713 --> 39:42.953
You'll shoot Allison?

39:46.509 --> 39:49.876
Oh, god, I don't know
if I can do this.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.092
Thanks.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.428
Come on, Jo,
you shoot Allison,

39:56.561 --> 39:58.677
I'll be long gone
before she hits the ground.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.020
No one wants that!
You can't win here!

40:03.026 --> 40:05.733
Okay, here we go.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.987
You're right, Beverly,
I can't shoot Allison!

40:14.495 --> 40:16.360
I'm glad you're
being reasonable.

40:16.831 --> 40:17.946
I wouldn't say that.

40:23.504 --> 40:24.710
Payback's a bitch.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.249
Go! Go! Go!

40:31.804 --> 40:33.886
Allison. Allison,
can you hear me?

40:34.557 --> 40:35.672
Dad?

40:37.560 --> 40:38.595
Can you hear me?

40:39.812 --> 40:41.518
Beverly. Beverly.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.390
Ah. Beverly doesn't
live here anymore.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.270
How can I be sure?

40:47.612 --> 40:50.103
Because I saved
your life in 1947.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.022
Now we're even.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.113
Ah, Zoe?

40:57.497 --> 40:59.328
Thank God.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.323
Oh!

41:03.503 --> 41:04.993
When did you get here?

41:18.309 --> 41:19.298
How you feeling?

41:20.186 --> 41:23.849
Well, it's good
to be back to
my old self.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.313
You and me both.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.726
You know, Jack,
it was surreal.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.941
There were times
when l was aware

41:29.070 --> 41:31.812
when she was trying
to use my codes.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.275
I tried to fight her.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.865
I tried to wake up.

41:36.035 --> 41:37.445
You tried
everything you could.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.069
Yeah, well,
it wasn't enough.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.285
Well...
Excuse me.

41:40.415 --> 41:42.827
Uh, Barbara says
we've recovered
the black box.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.119
And all the data is safe.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.538
We just don't know
how much information
Beverly has gotten,

41:46.671 --> 41:47.706
what she plans
to do with it,

41:47.839 --> 41:50.000
or where she's gone.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.333
Well, at the moment
I'm just glad she's
not in your head.

41:54.971 --> 41:55.835
I'm going to go
check on Grace.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.588
Nice to have you back.
Thanks, Henry.

42:00.309 --> 42:03.437
You know, Jo and Zoe
were amazing today.

42:09.652 --> 42:10.641
You should go talk to him.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.861
Look, Zoe, I...
I'm not saying that
I'm okay with what happened.

42:16.993 --> 42:20.702
Honestly I really
don't understand
why you did it.

42:20.830 --> 42:24.288
But I'm not going to
stand in your way.

42:26.961 --> 42:27.950
Thanks.

42:31.466 --> 42:32.831
I'll be back in a second.

42:35.219 --> 42:38.336
Zoe.
How's my hero?

42:38.931 --> 42:40.137
Please, I almost
killed you.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.676
No. You brought me back.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.926
And, uh,
it's sort of nice
to be saved.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.774
You okay?

42:52.445 --> 42:54.527
I don't understand
what happened with Zane.

42:55.782 --> 42:57.488
Things changed
between us.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.281
ljust wish I knew why.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.655
Come on.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.992
There's something
I've been wanting
to tell you.

43:11.047 --> 43:13.038
I think now's
the right time.

43:14.008 --> 43:17.967
It happened on
Founder's Day when
Henry, Jo, Fargo...
