00:02.001 --> 00:04.337
Previously on Lost:

00:07.549 --> 00:08.508
Michael.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.927
I found them. The Others.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.430
I saw one.
I followed him back to their camp.

00:14.515 --> 00:20.311
They live in tents.
Canvas tents and tepees.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.106
They eat dried fish.
They're worse off than we are.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.949
They have a hatch.
They keep it guarded 24/7.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.453
Two guards, two guns.
And two guns is all I saw.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.913
Michael?

00:42.459 --> 00:45.670
So I came back to tell you.

00:45.754 --> 00:49.882
- Did you see Walt?
- No.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.135
But I know he's there.

00:52.636 --> 00:58.141
As soon as I get my strength back,
I will take us back there.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.936
And we are gonna get my boy back.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.406
Hey, John. John.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.700
I was hoping I could
borrow one of these guns.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.871
- Is this supposed to be a secret?
- Jack's asleep.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.999
More target practice?

01:23.083 --> 01:26.627
Yeah. Well, you know,
just wanna stay sharp.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.465
You got a date?

01:30.549 --> 01:34.385
No. Old habits, you know?

01:34.470 --> 01:36.429
- Yes, I do.
- Thanks, man.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.931
Hey, can I just
get a couple of these bullets?

01:39.016 --> 01:40.850
I promise I won't...

01:40.934 --> 01:43.561
- Damn. I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right, I got it.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.578
Come on. Where are you?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.973
- I'm coming, Walt. I'm coming.
- Locke.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.647
John.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.985
Stay in there. Stay...

03:14.069 --> 03:16.487
- Michael, what are you...?
- Stay in there.

03:16.572 --> 03:20.616
- Hey, whatever's going on...
- Look, I'm going after my son.

03:20.701 --> 03:24.453
I'm going after my son and nobody
is going to stop me, OK? OK?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.956
That is my right.
That is a father's right.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.285
Hey.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.416
- What are you doing out here?
- Nothing. Just getting some air.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.835
Come on. We should talk.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.847
- How many?
- Rifles and pistols? Eleven total.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.265
- That's it?
- That's it.

04:26.350 --> 04:30.603
- They took five of 'em right off us.
- How long to get to their camp?

04:30.687 --> 04:33.481
We leave now, move fast,
middle of the night tomorrow.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.277
They have no idea I know where they are.
They won't be expecting us.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.906
So we get the guns and we go.
Right now, just the five of us.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.115
No. Five's not enough.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.618
You said there's
at least 20 of them with our guns.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.955
- We're not sure if what you saw was...
- Hey, I know what I saw.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.624
We take too many people,
they'll hear us coming.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.293
I'm not taking a damn army
across the island.

04:54.378 --> 04:57.129
Sure you're in the best place
to be making decisions now?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.757
You got a son, Jack?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.093
They're dead.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.391
Ana Lucia and Libby are dead.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.228
I mean, we haven't even buried 'em yet.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.238
Me and you'll take Libby, OK?

05:29.246 --> 05:30.871
- Can you...?
- Yeah. Of course.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.957
- Sawyer, would you...?
- Yeah.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.419
You should stay here.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.213
We'll bury them tonight...

05:40.048 --> 05:42.049
...then we'll figure out what's next.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.464
Hey.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.258
Put your hands up.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.344
Put 'em up. Don't move.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.139
Relax, buddy. I ain't moving.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.226
- Why don't you just put that...?
- Shut up.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.773
- You're Walt's old man, aren't you?
- What?

07:33.203 --> 07:36.205
What are you doing? We need him.

07:42.629 --> 07:47.216
Bag him, quick.
His friends are right behind us.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.819
Hello.

08:08.655 --> 08:12.658
- I didn't hear you come in, man.
- I left my shoes outside.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.868
They were muddy.

08:15.495 --> 08:20.833
- Did you find him? Henry?
- No.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.510
I hear you're a priest.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.015
Yes.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.683
Guess you believe in hell, then.

08:42.606 --> 08:46.775
For a brief time,
I served in a small parish in England.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.653
Every Sunday after Mass

08:49.738 --> 08:53.449
I would see a young boy
waiting at the back of the church.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.076
And then, one day,
the boy confessed to me

08:56.161 --> 08:59.622
that he had beaten
his dog to death with a shovel.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.797
And he said the dog had bitten
his baby sister on the cheek,

09:08.882 --> 09:10.883
and he needed to protect her.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.722
And he wanted to know
whether he would go to hell for this.

09:18.016 --> 09:22.144
I told him that God would understand.

09:22.229 --> 09:27.775
That he would be forgiven
as long as he was sorry.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.072
But the boy did not care
about forgiveness.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.160
He was only afraid
that if he did go to hell,

09:40.205 --> 09:42.706
that dog would be there waiting for him.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.071
Hey.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.826
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.539
I was coming back to check on you.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.959
Yeah, man. I had to get out of there.

10:27.043 --> 10:31.714
I just... I have to get my son back.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.967
We're gonna help you do that, Michael.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.554
It's gotta be the way I said, man.
Just the five of us.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.265
Otherwise it won't work. It won't work.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.601
- We're gonna figure that out.
- I have already figured it out.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.062
It's gotta be just the people
who already know.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.482
You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley.
That's it.

10:50.567 --> 10:54.111
Anybody else...
Look, it puts him in more danger.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.239
You don't get to decide this.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.117
It's my son. It's my call.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.204
And that's the way it has to be.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.422
Then that's the way it'll be.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.772
Hey.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.691
Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.403
Hi.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.991
- Have you seen Eko?
- No.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.539
You know, we're building a church.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.209
Is there something you want, Charlie?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.172
Yeah.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.176
I found something in the pallet
I thought you might need.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.766
Vaccine?

12:05.850 --> 12:09.395
I don't know what we need vaccine for,
but if anyone should have it,

12:09.479 --> 12:11.480
you and the baby should.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.067
It's all right.
It's a pneumatic injector.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.821
You just put it into your leg, and...

12:19.614 --> 12:21.073
...it goes right in.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.244
- Quite painless, really.
- You seem to know a lot about it.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.038
I tried it.

12:28.123 --> 12:31.583
I wanted to make sure it was safe
before giving it to you and the baby.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.252
Well, how do you feel?

12:33.336 --> 12:35.337
I mean, did it do anything?
What did it do?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.132
I don't know. I feel fine.

12:38.216 --> 12:43.929
Anyway, it says you're supposed to
give yourself a shot every nine days.

12:44.013 --> 12:49.101
All right? So, I mean, there's enough
here for you and the baby for a while.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.270
That's it.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.026
- All right. I'll put it...
- Yeah.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.863
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.739
I should really feed him.

13:02.824 --> 13:07.870
Yeah. Hey, Claire, do you think
maybe you and I could...?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.372
Oh, my God.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.001
Michael's back.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.641
Michael?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.608
Look, there's Michael!

13:42.614 --> 13:44.573
Yeah.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.042
- OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.461
It's good to see you, too.

14:00.006 --> 14:05.427
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.029
Who?

14:25.573 --> 14:27.574
Ana Lucia and Libby.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.786
What happened to them?

14:34.749 --> 14:37.417
They were murdered.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.644
Hey there, Michael.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.817
Not gonna hold that against you.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.861
Fair's fair. I took your boy.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.742
- But don't do that again, OK?
- Where is he, you son of a bitch?

15:12.036 --> 15:15.497
Hey, looky what I found.
She was following her friends.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.541
They're half a click behind us.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.668
You make one sound...

15:22.005 --> 15:23.880
...you'll never see your boy again.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.678
Gag him. Get ready with the torches.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.763
I'm gonna go talk to her people.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.023
- We'd better head back.
- What?

15:41.107 --> 15:43.025
- Find the trail.
- I've lost it.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.111
You don't just lose a trail.
You just don't want to find him.

15:46.195 --> 15:50.282
That's right. I've been running through
the jungle toward the sound of gunfire

15:50.366 --> 15:52.367
because I don't care about Michael.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.911
You know what happens
if we turn around and go back?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.622
We're never gonna see him again.

15:56.706 --> 16:01.668
And that's gonna be on us.
On you and on me.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.837
You're exactly right, Jack.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.800
- Who are you?
- He's the son of a bitch

16:08.885 --> 16:12.346
- that shot me on the raft.
- Why don't you point the gun down?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.727
It's OK. He's just delivering a message.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.398
He has to scare your friends to do it.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.818
- I don't believe you.
- You don't believe what?

16:26.903 --> 16:29.154
I think there's more of us
than there are of you.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.365
That's an interesting theory.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.742
Light them up.

16:37.497 --> 16:41.333
Give me your weapons,
turn around, go home.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.834
No.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.673
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.758
Bring her out, Alex.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.970
- Go on.
- You.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.932
- Come on, Alex.
- Please?

17:01.562 --> 17:03.438
Let's go. Up. Up.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.821
Is Claire OK?

17:11.906 --> 17:15.992
Did she have the baby? Is it OK?

17:16.077 --> 17:17.618
Is it a boy or a girl?

17:19.705 --> 17:23.208
Like I said, curiosity.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.678
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

17:55.158 --> 17:59.369
His friends are going home.
Divvy 'em up.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.923
Sorry.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.345
Hey. Hey.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.703
What do you say, Doc?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.792
And here I was thinking
the Irish drink when somebody dies.

18:46.876 --> 18:50.086
- I'm not Irish.
- Neither am I.

18:53.216 --> 18:56.051
So what happened
out there in the jungle?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.470
Exactly what he said.
He found the camp...

18:58.554 --> 19:00.806
I ain't talking about Mike.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.891
You and Freckles.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.769
Before you found him.
You were gone all night.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.522
We got caught in a net.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.608
What's the hell's
that supposed to mean?

19:11.692 --> 19:16.154
It means we got caught in a net.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.241
That what they're calling it these days?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.955
Is it true? Henry is gone?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.998
- Yeah.
- Who's going after him?

19:27.083 --> 19:30.836
- Locke and Eko went in the night.
- We ain't seen either of 'em since.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.296
Those are the guns?
What are you doing with them?

19:33.381 --> 19:36.341
What do you think we're doing?
It's time to finish this.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.927
- When do we leave?
- In the morning.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.013
You're not coming, Sayid.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.683
- Excuse me?
- Michael wants to keep it small.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.018
Me, Kate, Hurley and him.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.605
Well even though Pippi Longstocking
and the damned Grape Ape

19:50.690 --> 19:53.024
are ideal candidates
for The Dirty Dozen,

19:53.109 --> 19:55.026
we might wanna bring the Red Beret.

19:55.111 --> 19:58.530
It's Michael's call.
He knows where we're going.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.825
It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.457
Welcome aboard.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.841
So... you wake up
in the middle of the night,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.802
grab your Jesus stick,
and race off into the jungle.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.430
You don't call, you don't write...

21:05.514 --> 21:09.684
I'm sorry. I had work to do.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.062
Right. Yeah.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.941
Charlie, would you do me a favor?

21:18.653 --> 21:22.447
I was hoping you could
bring my things from the beach here.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.532
What for?

21:25.701 --> 21:28.078
You moving in here?

21:28.162 --> 21:30.538
Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?

21:30.623 --> 21:34.292
Yes, I am moving in here.

21:34.377 --> 21:38.254
Well... what about the church?

21:38.339 --> 21:40.966
You said we were supposed to be
building it together.

21:41.050 --> 21:45.220
I am supposed to do
something different now.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.019
And what am I supposed to do?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.315
Bring me my things.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.280
- Bring your own things.
- Charlie, please.

22:04.365 --> 22:08.368
You'd better leg it, mate.
Clock's ticking.

22:22.591 --> 22:26.011
Got some good news for you.
Captain Arab's in, too.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.221
Cavalry rides at sunrise.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.182
- You told Sayid?
- Yeah, I told Sayid.

22:32.435 --> 22:36.021
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:36.105 --> 22:39.816
I figured if we're going to war, we'd
want the one guy who's been in a war.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.942
That a problem?

22:44.864 --> 22:49.159
No. It's not a problem.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.287
All right, then.

23:10.181 --> 23:13.683
- Get off of me.
- You got a problem, Michael?

23:13.768 --> 23:16.728
You march me a day and night
without any rest, yeah.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.688
My problem is I'm tired.

23:18.773 --> 23:21.983
Well, I'd offer to knock you out
and carry you, but we're here.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.697
Put him right over here.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.497
Tell her we're here.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.423
I can't promise this won't hurt.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.802
What the...? Damn it.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.888
- Relax. Just taking some blood.
- Taking some blood? For what?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.432
Who are you people? Where's my son?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.270
That's it. All done.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.733
See you in the funny pages.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.991
- Hello, Michael.
- Where's my son?

24:53.075 --> 24:55.660
My name is Miss Klugh.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.249
I was hoping you might help me
answer some questions.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.172
- About Walt.
- Where is he?

25:07.256 --> 25:11.176
- Is he your biological son?
- What?

25:11.260 --> 25:14.846
- Are you his father?
- Yes, I'm his...

25:14.930 --> 25:16.931
How old was he
when he started speaking?

25:18.475 --> 25:19.642
I... He...

25:19.727 --> 25:21.769
Did he have any illnesses growing up?

25:21.854 --> 25:25.190
- Headaches? Fainting spells?
- What? No.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.360
I don't... I wasn't there.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.198
He was halfway around the world.
Why are you asking me?

25:33.282 --> 25:39.287
Did Walt ever appear
in a place he wasn't supposed to be?

25:43.125 --> 25:46.878
You say he was halfway around the world,
but did you see...

25:46.962 --> 25:49.214
I want my son.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.300
You bring him to me right now.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.928
I wanna see my boy.

25:58.682 --> 26:02.894
For someone
who wants his son back so badly,

26:02.978 --> 26:06.522
you don't seem to know
much about him, Michael.

26:24.124 --> 26:27.001
Hey. You're not coming.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.589
- Welcome back, Michael.
- Look, I know Sawyer told you.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.926
But it's not gonna work.
You're not coming.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.595
And why is it that I'm not coming?

26:37.680 --> 26:40.682
Because you're going after
the guy who escaped,

26:40.766 --> 26:42.850
and I'm going after my son.

26:42.935 --> 26:47.021
Are you implying I'd let a desire
for revenge compromise Walt's safety?

26:47.106 --> 26:52.235
I'm implying that I decide
who stays and who goes, and you stay.

26:58.659 --> 27:02.245
I know you wanna help, right?

27:04.373 --> 27:07.292
But I gotta do this my way.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.804
Of course.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.601
Good luck, Michael.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.773
Yeah. Thanks.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.205
Bloody hell.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.762
Are you kidding me?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.975
Did someone put you up to this?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.738
Vincent?

29:50.122 --> 29:52.248
You were supposed to come right back.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.208
You were out all night.
What happened?

29:56.879 --> 29:59.380
We were unable to find Henry's trail.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.384
Yeah, I got that.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.680
- Where's Locke?
- I do not know.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.520
We're burying
Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.858
Thank you.

30:18.942 --> 30:22.487
I will mourn them in my own way.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.752
Who's gonna talk?

30:39.588 --> 30:44.050
- What?
- At the funeral. Who's gonna talk?

30:45.093 --> 30:48.137
I'm sure Hurley'll wanna
say something about Libby.

30:48.931 --> 30:52.183
I never even knew her last name.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.019
Ana Lucia.

30:56.647 --> 31:00.983
- It was Cortez.
- Cortez.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.487
Well, there you go.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.413
I screwed her.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.667
What?

31:19.211 --> 31:23.589
It's how she got my gun. Ana.
She jumped me.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.761
We got caught in a net.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.519
Why are you telling me this?

31:45.362 --> 31:48.990
Because you're about the closest thing
I got to a friend, Doc.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.246
And because she's gone.

32:01.128 --> 32:05.381
Well, at least now
we get to kill somebody.

32:34.995 --> 32:38.706
- Jack fill you in on the plan?
- What plan?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.791
We're leaving first thing tomorrow.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.878
Back across the island to their camp.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.631
OK.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.717
And what about you, man?
You coming with us?

32:51.261 --> 32:53.304
Why would I wanna go?

32:55.891 --> 33:01.103
- Because they killed her.
- Michael, come on.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.313
What do you say, Hugo?

33:07.736 --> 33:12.156
I'm sorry about Walt, dude,
but I'm not coming.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.285
- You're sorry about...
- Michael.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.125
Dinnertime.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.717
When are you gonna do it?

34:13.802 --> 34:17.179
- When am I going to do what?
- Kill me.

34:22.518 --> 34:26.063
I've seen where you live.
I know how to get here.

34:26.148 --> 34:31.694
You have been asking me questions
I don't know the answers to for a week.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.739
I don't even think my son is alive.

34:35.824 --> 34:40.034
He is alive, Michael.
He's standing outside right now.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.748
What, do you think I'm stupid?

34:45.000 --> 34:49.003
There's been a development
since you came here, Michael.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.589
One of our people was captured by yours.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.967
- So go get him back.
- We can't do that.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.764
But you can.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.727
And, if you do...

35:06.188 --> 35:08.564
...we'll let you and Walt go free.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.115
- I want to see my son.
- Michael...

35:18.200 --> 35:22.077
I want to see him.
If he is out there, you bring him in.

35:24.498 --> 35:27.166
You bring him in here right now.

35:35.217 --> 35:36.842
Pickett.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.476
You have three minutes.

35:51.858 --> 35:55.402
- Walt?
- Dad.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.739
Let him go. Let him go.
Get your hands off him right now.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.827
- Dad, don't.
- Are you OK? Huh?

36:03.787 --> 36:07.414
- Yeah.
- Are you... Did they hurt you?

36:10.252 --> 36:13.295
- They make me take tests.
- They make you what?

36:13.380 --> 36:16.215
We're not gonna talk about that.

36:17.467 --> 36:21.345
- How's Vincent?
- Well, Vincent's...

36:21.429 --> 36:24.390
He's great.
He's great. He misses you.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.184
Hey, don't be scared, man.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.603
Don't be scared.
It's gonna be over real soon.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.690
- I'm gonna get you out.
- They're not who they say they are.

36:32.774 --> 36:33.858
They're pretending.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.944
- Want me to put you in the room?
- Pretending? Pretending what?

36:37.028 --> 36:38.362
OK, that's it. We're done.

36:38.446 --> 36:42.491
No, wait. Hey, wait, wait.
Come here, Walt. Wait, come here.

36:42.576 --> 36:46.745
Dad, don't leave me.
Help me, please. Don't leave me.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.790
I won't, man.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.501
- I promise you. I will get you out.
- Dad. Dad.

36:52.586 --> 36:55.880
- Let him go. Walt, wait. Let go of him.
- I love you.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.841
- Walt, I'm gonna get you out of here.
- I love you.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.970
- I love you too, Walt.
- Put me down. Let me go. Dad!

37:04.180 --> 37:06.181
I'll get you...

37:23.533 --> 37:27.786
After you release our man,
I'm gonna need you to do something else.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.999
I'll do it.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.754
Whatever you want.

37:36.838 --> 37:42.134
I'm writing four names down.
Four of your friends.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.219
We need you to bring them here.

37:46.765 --> 37:52.645
You have to bring only these
four people, Michael. Just them.

37:54.856 --> 37:59.985
If you don't bring
all the people on the list...

38:02.697 --> 38:04.782
...you'll never see Walt again.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.994
OK. OK. OK.

38:10.372 --> 38:14.208
Do you understand, Michael?

38:15.377 --> 38:17.878
Yes. What do I tell them?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.464
Doesn't matter.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.883
Make up a story.

38:24.010 --> 38:27.429
They'll be angry enough
to believe whatever you say.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.980
Who's James Ford?

38:36.064 --> 38:40.025
You know him as Sawyer.
You know the rest of them?

38:40.902 --> 38:42.111
Yeah.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.493
I know them.

38:52.539 --> 38:57.501
If I do all this...
If I do what you say.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.920
You'll get your son back...

39:01.923 --> 39:04.049
...and you both go free.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.060
And I want the boat.

40:35.517 --> 40:40.395
When the plane crashed, I was on my way
to Los Angeles to bury my dad.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.148
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

40:43.233 --> 40:46.443
It seems like such a long time ago now.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.530
I was gonna go right from
the airport to the cemetery, but...

40:50.532 --> 40:52.658
...I had no idea
what I was gonna say.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.996
And here we are again.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.710
I think Michael has been compromised.

41:05.380 --> 41:09.716
- Let's keep walking, Jack.
- What do you mean, compromised?

41:09.801 --> 41:12.511
His actions are not of a man
who is telling the truth.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.055
Why would he lie to us?

41:15.140 --> 41:17.975
Because I believe
a father would do anything for his son.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.644
Because I believe that Michael
may have freed Henry,

41:20.728 --> 41:23.313
and because I believe
he's leading you into a trap.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.274
You believe a lot, Sayid.

41:25.358 --> 41:29.027
And I also believe
that Henry was one of them.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.996
- All right. Let's go talk to him.
- No. He must believe he's in control.

41:39.080 --> 41:43.584
- Why the hell would we wanna do that?
- So we can create an advantage.

41:47.839 --> 41:51.383
- How?
- I don't know yet.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.469
But we have one more night
to figure that out.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.934
Ana Lucia Cortez was...

42:03.271 --> 42:06.440
Before we crashed,
she was a police officer.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.652
I don't think it was
easy for her being here,

42:10.737 --> 42:14.281
but I think she did the best she could.

42:14.365 --> 42:19.620
She was a woman of few words
and I'm gonna follow her example.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.625
Rest in peace, Ana.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.140
Libby was...

42:43.728 --> 42:45.062
She was...

42:46.648 --> 42:48.649
She...

42:50.443 --> 42:52.778
Libby was a psychologist.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.824
Or a psychiatrist.

43:01.037 --> 43:05.916
One of those. Either way,
she probably helped a lot of people.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.796
She helped me.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.508
She was my friend.

43:15.802 --> 43:18.971
It's not fair
that this happened to her. It's not.

43:28.064 --> 43:30.941
I'm going with you.

43:39.242 --> 43:41.243
Goodbye, Libby.

44:10.315 --> 44:16.320
Boat.
