00:01.839 --> 00:04.638
<i>Previously on Married with Children.:</i>

00:04.840 --> 00:07.798
I can't believe you'd forget
the most romantic night of our life.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.274
I remember, sweetheart.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.199
And then we shared a Mister Softee.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.279
Oh, yeah. And we've been
sharing one ever since.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.672
Oh, Marcy, what should I do?

00:19.880 --> 00:21.359
You thought about seeing someone?

00:21.600 --> 00:25.434
Well, I have had my eye
on the UPS guy.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.158
No, I mean you and Al should
see a marriage counsellor.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.873
Well, if I'm so difficult
to put up with...

00:34.080 --> 00:35.399
...why don't you just leave?

00:36.040 --> 00:37.234
Well, maybe I will.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.072
So go.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.838
Walk out that door.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.192
Turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.871
I will survive.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.197
Yeah, well, Marcy, of course.
He's always threatening to leave.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.675
But somewhere
between the house and the Dodge...

01:33.880 --> 01:37.031
...he realises
he'd have to break in a new toilet seat.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.552
Damn, I never thought
he'd think of that.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.989
Let me call you back.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.552
So where do you think you're going?

01:50.800 --> 01:53.792
To live the life I should have had.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.030
So, what corner
will you be washing windshields on?

01:58.280 --> 02:00.430
Wouldn't you love to know.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.028
Okay, Al.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.071
Go on. Just go.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.271
But don't take anything
out of this house.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.433
Well, I did kind of want the couch,
but then your butt would have to go too.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.112
Wait a minute.
What am I thinking about?

02:13.320 --> 02:15.356
I almost forgot
the two most important things.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.118
What are we gonna do
about custody?

02:17.360 --> 02:19.635
Well, obviously,
they should stay with me.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.990
I'm the one who spends
the most time with them.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.430
While I worked
to put a roof over their heads...

02:24.640 --> 02:27.359
...but still had time
to listen to their stories...

02:27.560 --> 02:29.994
...to laugh with them,
to cry with them?

02:30.280 --> 02:33.033
Yes, but who stayed up with them
all night?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.559
Oh, God.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.876
I just don't think
I can live without them.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.348
Well, me either.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.677
Well, we'll just have to split them.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.348
You take the little coloured one.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.030
<i>I can't watch football
on that little TV.</i>

02:53.960 --> 02:55.837
- Kelly, shovel the snow.
- I don't have to.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.476
Oh, no, Al, the kids.
This could scar them for life.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.309
Don't worry. If they can survive seeing
your mother's bathing suit fall off...

03:03.520 --> 03:05.158
...they can get through this.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.639
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.037
Your mother and I are breaking up.
Take care of yourselves.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.831
Don't forget to write...

03:21.040 --> 03:23.235
...or colour me a pretty picture.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.948
Hey, why do I get them?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.236
That's the natural order of things,
Peg.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.274
You birth them, suckle them,
take care of them.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.272
We hunt.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.156
Al Bundy, you are making
the biggest mistake of your life...

03:39.360 --> 03:44.229
...not only because you are a brainless,
spineless, soapless idiot...

03:44.440 --> 03:47.398
...but because you have no money.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.312
Oh, yes, I do, Peg.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.229
We husbands always have
our hidden little nest eggs.

03:53.480 --> 03:58.235
Yes. And we wives always know
about that little nest egg.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.432
You know the one you hid
in the vacuum? I bought a new dress.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.036
And I found all the quarters
that you hid in Bud's mattress.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.872
So that's why my mattress
was so lumpy.

04:10.840 --> 04:15.391
I kept dreaming that I was sleeping
on tiny little breasts.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.077
That jingled.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.471
Well, you got me, Peg.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.956
All my little hidey-holes
have been found out...

04:25.160 --> 04:27.549
...except this one.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.997
Fiendishly clever.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.759
You imbeciles.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.158
Don't you realise that's the only reason
we men ever lift the seat?

04:40.640 --> 04:42.870
- Come on, Bud, let's go.
- I'm with you, Pop.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.834
No, you're not. I just need someone
to help me push the car.

04:49.960 --> 04:50.949
Thanks, Al.

04:51.160 --> 04:55.950
For the first time in our marriage,
you're leaving me satisfied.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.193
<i>We wanna send a special
home-shopping hello to Peggy Bundy.</i>

05:04.640 --> 05:05.914
<i>It's been a long time, Peggy.</i>

05:06.120 --> 05:07.473
<i>And speaking of time...</i>

05:07.680 --> 05:11.389
<i>...look at this lovely Martin Lawrence
cuck oo clock.</i>

05:11.760 --> 05:13.398
Isn't that cute?

05:13.600 --> 05:16.239
The second hand has a gun.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.233
<i>It's 3.:00, bitch.</i>

05:26.600 --> 05:29.160
Hey, Mom. How you doing?

05:29.360 --> 05:32.432
Oh, not bad for an over-the-hill...

05:32.640 --> 05:37.077
...discarded, stringy-haired loser.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.034
I don't think your hair
looks that stringy.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.838
I'm all alone.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.994
Don't worry, Mom.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.112
- We'll never leave you.
- Oh, no.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.279
I haven't seen her like this...

05:54.480 --> 05:57.517
...since a kid at McDonald's asked her
if she was Ronald's mother.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.469
Bud...

05:59.720 --> 06:02.393
...she really misses Dad, huh?

06:02.600 --> 06:03.953
Well, don't you?

06:04.200 --> 06:06.998
I mean, remember when he...

06:07.560 --> 06:11.917
Oh, and the cute way that he-
He...

06:13.000 --> 06:15.878
But then on Christmas,
when he used to...

06:17.480 --> 06:20.040
What the hell is she crying about?

06:20.680 --> 06:21.908
I don't know.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.395
- I hate to see her like this though.
- I know.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.432
What do you do
when you get depressed?

06:26.640 --> 06:31.270
Well, go out and find a rich man
to buy me stuff.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.238
- Stepdaddy!
- Stepdaddy!

06:38.360 --> 06:40.920
- We better hurry. Time is our enemy.
- Yeah.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.195
So is gravity.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.589
<i>Al Bundy's gone away
I'll have a gag-free day</i>

06:55.800 --> 07:00.112
<i>It always pays to pray
I've never felt so gay</i>

07:02.080 --> 07:05.629
My life is over,
and you're setting off fireworks?

07:05.880 --> 07:09.634
Well, actually, that was old man
McGinty and the rest of the block.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.196
Oh, that reminds me.
The parade's at 2.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.031
I am riding in the big shoe float.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.233
Marcy, think about my feelings.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.319
I mean, imagine if Al was your husband
and he ran off and left you.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.152
I am.

07:28.960 --> 07:29.915
I'm sorry.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.552
You know, Peggy...

07:32.760 --> 07:35.149
...I know this may come
as a shock to you...

07:35.360 --> 07:38.079
...but I never really cared
for your ex-husband.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.955
- We're not divorced.
- Think positive, Peggy.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.470
Well, I can't. I'm all alone.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.433
You know, I've always had a man
to take care of me.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.073
First, my father...

07:50.280 --> 07:52.510
...then my Aunt Bob...

07:53.760 --> 07:55.557
...and then Al.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.637
But now I have no one.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.479
Who's gonna rub my bottom?

08:02.880 --> 08:03.835
Marcy, I'm scared.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.635
You know, I've never had a real
paycheque or balanced a chequebook.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.750
Well, so neither has Al.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.990
Look, Peggy,
you're in the prime of your life.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.589
Your early 40s.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.796
Late 30s?

08:21.640 --> 08:22.834
Mid...?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.314
Early...?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.158
Twenty-nine?

08:28.480 --> 08:31.153
See? You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.953
It's your turn, girlfriend.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.269
Gee, Marcy...

08:35.480 --> 08:37.674
- ... I'm starting to feel better already.
- Good.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.952
Now, you should do what I did
after Steve left.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.994
Pick up men at the airport?

08:45.240 --> 08:46.719
After that.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.437
Is this Al's?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.872
You try.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.391
Boy, I do feel better.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.710
You know,
I have always hated this thing.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.156
I gave you that.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.278
Sorry.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.955
Marcy, this is really helping me out.

09:22.160 --> 09:26.233
Well, listen. After the buzz fades,
just remember that wherever Al is...

09:26.440 --> 09:30.194
...that ungrateful baboon
will be feeling 10 times worse.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.554
Hey.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.311
Look at that.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.352
You've got the moves.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.869
Or the runs.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.754
I'll tell you what.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.912
This is the life.
You know what I did today?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.189
I made breakfast.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.549
Peg lied.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.797
You don't have to make Pop Tarts
from scratch.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.237
- Pretty snazzy place you got here.
- Yeah.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.908
<i>Vista del O'Hare.</i>

10:19.360 --> 10:22.830
Used up my nest egg,
but it's got a pool, it's got free cable...

10:23.040 --> 10:25.110
...and it's conveniently located
right by the-

10:34.520 --> 10:36.033
Airport?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.434
Yeah. Yeah.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.234
But the neighbours don't even hear
the planes anymore.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.199
That's because they're deaf.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.429
Hey.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.393
You guys think
I ought to get Marcy a waterbed?

10:47.600 --> 10:50.034
Yeah.
May I recommend Lake Michigan?

10:56.680 --> 10:59.319
All right, all you babes
in the Tri-County area...

10:59.520 --> 11:03.638
...get ready because
Dr. Al is ready to operate.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.440
Not dressed like that, you're not.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.200
We got to get this man
a new look, stat.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.390
George Clooney, eat your heart out.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.717
You are the money.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.148
You sure women
like these contour briefs?

11:27.600 --> 11:32.594
Oh, absolutely.
You see how they lift and separate?

11:32.800 --> 11:35.268
It's like a Wonderbra for your ass.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.797
Well, they do kind of move
with you...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.468
...and no visible panty line.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.591
Damn, I'm hot.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.834
Hey, son, come on in.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.595
Hey.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.793
Pretty cool pad for a rest home.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.999
Son, come on over here.
Let me give you the tour.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.391
Well, that's it.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.595
- Hold me tight, son.
- Oh, Dad. You miss me?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.837
<i>No, it's the 8: 15 from Bangkok.</i>

12:22.960 --> 12:24.075
Nice pad, Dad.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.238
Listen. Mom wanted me to bring over
some of your stuff.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.832
Oh, look.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.477
<i>She shredded my Big 'Uns
into Little 'Uns.</i>

12:39.960 --> 12:41.951
Look on the bright side, buddy.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.709
It'll make a great jigsaw puzzle
on a rainy day.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.192
Look, Miss July's toe.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.794
Doesn't take much to get
him going, does it?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.310
Son, let's me and you
go pick up some foxes.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.513
Gee, Dad, I'd love to...

12:58.720 --> 13:01.678
...but between your new hair
and new ass, I don't stand a chance.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.198
- You got that right.
- Yeah.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.232
Oh, yeah.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.796
You know, I haven't been
in a singles bar in 15 years.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.629
Mom, you've been married
for 25 years.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.638
Gee, I hope I remember what to do.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.278
Oh, yeah.
It's all coming back to me now.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.914
Mom, you can't act so pushy.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.031
Kelly, it's the '90s.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.595
Women are supposed
to be the aggressors.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.597
Yeah, if they're losers.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.669
All you have to do is sit back, unbutton
a button, and they'll all come to you.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.279
That is just sick.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.755
You are setting yourself up
for a domineering...

13:57.960 --> 13:59.951
...sexually aggressive relationship.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.758
Well, duh.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.190
Well, what do you suggest we do?

14:05.400 --> 14:08.551
Lie naked on the hood of a Trans Am
out in the parking lot?

14:08.800 --> 14:10.995
No, not till last call.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.313
Just watch and learn.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.992
See you.

14:22.920 --> 14:27.357
You know, I taught her that
the first day of junior high.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.993
Oh, I'm so proud.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.668
I just hate this place.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.472
Maybe it would be best to just...

14:33.680 --> 14:36.877
...go home
and get in bed with Jefferson.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.670
Well, I'll try anything once.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.076
I mean, you're right.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.713
This place isn't for us.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.388
Look at all these hot young things.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.077
That gorgeous redhead
with that little blond boy.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.475
That's us, Peggy.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.953
Talk about your babe watch.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.912
Make way, boys.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.989
Lifeguard Al
is about to do a little body surfing.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.430
Traffic school, my ass.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.712
I'll fix his ticket.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.355
You're busted.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.834
Her bust?

15:37.040 --> 15:39.235
Yeah, isn't it great?

15:39.440 --> 15:41.670
I tell you, if Marcy
had headlights like these...

15:41.880 --> 15:43.757
...I wouldn't have to go
to traffic school.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.470
Of course, my 4th touchdown
was really my best.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.830
I faked out Porlogo...

15:57.040 --> 15:58.268
...went to the right...

15:58.480 --> 16:01.870
...and sprinted 75 yards
up the middle of the field...

16:02.080 --> 16:04.389
...and then I scored.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.875
Unlike tonight.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.949
Now, why would a lesbian
even go to a straight bar?

16:41.360 --> 16:42.998
I never thought this could happen.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.431
I've actually met somebody
as beautiful as me.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.358
You have a big ego.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.632
It matches my wallet and my car.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.029
Anything else?

17:05.839 --> 17:09.992
Quick, call the paramedics!
This old guy's having a heart attack!

17:11.880 --> 17:14.997
It looks like his diaper
is coming off.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.790
God, I love Mom's new boyfriend.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.633
I don't miss that-

17:21.839 --> 17:24.752
That guy who used to live here at all.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.912
Here, hold this.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.992
Hello.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.269
Daddy?

17:32.480 --> 17:35.552
No, I'm sorry, he's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

17:37.160 --> 17:40.072
It's Daddy, pumpkin.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.914
" Daddy Pumpkin. "

17:44.480 --> 17:47.438
And a number where he can reach you,
Mr. Pumpkin?

17:49.400 --> 17:53.791
Sweetheart, is there someone there
I can talk to with a brain stem?

17:54.520 --> 17:56.476
Put your brother on.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.079
Okay.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.192
Hey, Bud, you're really handsome.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.351
I did it, Dad.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.159
Well, thanks for calling, Daddy.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.078
Oh, before I forget...

18:13.280 --> 18:15.874
...a Mr. Pumpkin called for you.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.238
Okay?

18:19.000 --> 18:22.117
All right. I love you, Daddy. Bye.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.638
- Hey, Al.
- Hey.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.875
Come on, Al.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.631
Let's put on those contour briefs
and shake our money makers.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.558
No, I think I'll just stay in tonight...

18:43.760 --> 18:45.830
...and wash my hair.

18:46.360 --> 18:47.315
Wash it?

18:47.520 --> 18:51.718
Just run a DustBuster through
that puppy and let's be on our way.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.718
I've been out every night this week.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.797
I'm tired.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.788
Tired of going out, shelling out
and striking out.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.755
Yeah, well, maybe Al's right.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.918
- Nobody wants to go out every night.
- I do.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.469
Sure you do, because you're married.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.837
Come on, Al.
You're just depressed...

19:11.040 --> 19:14.271
...because you've been turned down
by a few hundred women.

19:15.040 --> 19:19.955
Last night, one kicked me in the groin
with her leg. Her wooden one.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.588
That's because you still got
Peggy's scent on you.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.030
Most women are sensitive
about those things.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.117
Who needs them?

19:28.680 --> 19:31.797
All we really need in life
is our buddies...

19:32.000 --> 19:33.831
...our beer...

19:34.560 --> 19:36.596
...an occasional dirt bath.

19:37.560 --> 19:41.235
And women condition us
to think we need them. We don't.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.396
All we need are each other.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.913
Hi.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.713
I'm one of your neighbours.

19:52.920 --> 19:53.909
Are you busy?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.038
Get out.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.470
- Out.
- You mean you're throwing us out?

19:59.680 --> 20:01.557
- I thought we were your buddies.
- You are.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.433
That's why I'm throwing you
out the door and not the window.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.395
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I broke a heel...

20:08.600 --> 20:10.875
...and I heard
you were in the shoe business.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.991
- Can you fix this?
- Oh, of course I can.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.633
I fix these all the time.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.638
My wife-
I mean, my former wife.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.110
wears shoes just like these.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.237
Are you divorced?

20:22.480 --> 20:24.471
I can be.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.756
- What's she like?
- Oh, I'd rather not say.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.589
She wouldn't want me talking about her
in front of another woman.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.870
She's the fiery type,
wiggles when she walks...

20:33.080 --> 20:34.957
...can't get enough of me in bed.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.278
Am I talking about her again?

20:37.960 --> 20:38.995
That's okay.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.270
I still talk about my ex-boyfriend.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.630
Would you like to know
what he's like?

20:44.280 --> 20:46.316
Hey, well, let me guess.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.551
Big, mean, built like an ape.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.993
Thanks for fixing my shoe.

21:05.305 --> 21:11.785
