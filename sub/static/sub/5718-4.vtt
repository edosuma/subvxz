WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:05.073
I don't get it.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.640
I can't lose any weight,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.376
I'm tired all the time,

00:08.442 --> 00:10.010
I get cold super-easy.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.545
Oh, are you stressed out
at work?

00:11.612 --> 00:12.946
Remind me again,
what do you do
for a living?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.449
I own and operate
an organic bakery truck.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.684
Oh, yeah!

00:16.750 --> 00:18.252
You're the hippie
muffin girl.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.322
I thought
you smelled familiar.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.159
Oh, your thyroid level
is low,

00:25.226 --> 00:26.760
which would explain
your symptoms.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.162
So, are you taking
your synthroid every day?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.330
Nah, I stopped it.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.101
Stopped the med
you're supposed
to be taking every day.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.535
Uh, why would you do that?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.704
Well, the guy
at whole foods
told me to.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.606
He said fish oil's
what's up.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.076
Good.
Smart to listen to him.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.277
You know what they say,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.113
"Doctors are just people
who couldn't hack it

00:45.179 --> 00:46.547
"as grocery baggers."

00:46.614 --> 00:49.083
(CHUCKLES)

00:49.150 --> 00:51.785
Okay, look, here's what you
need to know about synthroid.

00:51.852 --> 00:55.856
For best results,
the pill has to be
in the body.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.592
Who are you texting?

00:58.659 --> 01:01.162
I just want to run this
by Shep at whole foods.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.132
"Shep, what's up?"

01:04.965 --> 01:06.300
Hey!

01:06.367 --> 01:08.402
Okay, look, you have
a thyroid condition,

01:08.469 --> 01:10.070
so you need to take your
synthroid every day,

01:10.138 --> 01:11.872
or there could
be complications.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.242
Oh, and PS.,
I had one of your
"muffins" once,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.544
and that brick
used my colon
as a runway.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.580
Okay, that means
it's working.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.384
Are you this rude
to all your patients?

01:23.451 --> 01:26.620
Hey, hey.
This man is a rare jewel.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.957
He is the finest
medical mind
you will ever find...

01:30.023 --> 01:32.092
...within your limited
insurance coverage.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.765
You wouldn't last a minute
at whole foods.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.171
Wow, you got off
some good ones, boss.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.838
Look,
it's just so frustrating

01:44.905 --> 01:47.508
to see a patient
not take care of herself
like that.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.277
Which one you like,
the grocery bagger?

01:49.343 --> 01:51.912
Yeah, but I also liked the
"medicine on the inside" bit

01:51.979 --> 01:53.881
'cause it's funny
and true.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.149
I mean, they're all good.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.350
You don't have
to pick favorites.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.551
Yeah, well...

02:04.525 --> 02:06.760
Morning,
fruit of my loins,

02:06.827 --> 02:08.128
worshipper of my loins.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.930
BOTH: Ew!

02:09.997 --> 02:11.765
So you'll be home
by 6:00?
Why?

02:11.832 --> 02:14.268
'Cause your parents
are coming over for dinner.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.037
Remember, you felt guilty
'cause you don't talk
to them enough?

02:17.104 --> 02:18.206
Right.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.374
So I made you call
and invite them.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.843
(CLICKS TONGUE)
I'm such a good son.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.479
Do we have to have
dinner with grandma
and grandpa tonight?

02:25.546 --> 02:26.880
It is so painful.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.350
They always ask the same
two questions.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.618
(DEEP VOICE)
"How's school?"

02:30.684 --> 02:32.386
(NORMAL VOICE) and
(DEEP VOICE) "You like a boy?"

02:33.821 --> 02:35.122
I like when they come
to dinner.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.658
I find the long silences
rather meditative.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.763
Hey, we're all having dinner
with your grandparents,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.798
so I want smiles
on your faces

02:44.865 --> 02:46.066
and a good attitude.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.369
(CHUCKLES)

02:49.837 --> 02:51.939
This is gonna suck, man.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.442
My parents
aren't that bad.
Yeah.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.743
I look forward
to watching them

02:55.809 --> 02:56.977
push my food around
on their plates.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.979
Hey, that's Korean
food rearrangement.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.148
It's a sign of respect.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.984
Ken, let's be honest,
they don't like me.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.152
They love you.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.154
That's why, every time
I try and talk to them,

03:07.221 --> 03:08.456
they just sit there
stone-faced

03:08.522 --> 03:09.690
like Korean
Mount Rushmore.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.295
Oh, come on, everyone knows
Korean Mount Rushmore

03:14.362 --> 03:16.330
is that Gangnam style guy
and that couple from Lost.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.600
They're just not great
conversationalists.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.469
When my grandma died,
they just said,

03:21.535 --> 03:22.770
(KOREAN ACCENT)
"Grandma dead.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.473
"Here, candy."

03:25.539 --> 03:28.309
(NORMAL VOICE)
Besides, I'll be there,
and I'm always your buffer.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.510
Yeah, I guess.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.711
You know how it works.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.079
They talk to me,
I talk to you,

03:32.145 --> 03:33.581
you talk to me,
I talk to them.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.682
It's all good.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.184
I'll buff you hard, baby.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.687
Why does it always go to
a sexual place with you?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.255
You know I idle at horny.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.863
Yeah!

03:49.930 --> 03:51.098
Yay!
(LAUGHS)

03:51.164 --> 03:52.232
Now it's official.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.434
You're not just
a nurse...

03:53.501 --> 03:54.802
you're a registered
nurse.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.805
I know.
It's like going from
streetwalker to escort.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.243
(CHUCKLES)

04:03.311 --> 04:05.078
Now, are you aware
that this promotion

04:05.145 --> 04:06.514
doesn't come
with a pay increase?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.782
Oh, yeah, it's not about
the money for me.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.418
(LAUGHS)
I hope not.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.519
You don't make enough
for it to be
about the money.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.586
Okay.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.924
I cannot wait
to tell Dr. Ken
about this.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.526
He is gonna be
so excited.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.694
Uh-huh, sure,
he totally is.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.131
Your voice is so high
I can never tell
when you're covering.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.866
(HIGH-PITCHED)
I'm not!

04:25.933 --> 04:29.036
Okay, look, I know
our relationship can seem
a little bit one-sided,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.739
but at the end of the day,
he is still my husband.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.474
Sorry, what?

04:33.541 --> 04:35.208
Oh, what, have you
never heard that term
"work husband"?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.477
You didn't say work.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.778
I'm sure I said work.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.882
(CHUCKLING)
That's weird.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.751
Anyway, Dr. Ken
is a man of medicine,

04:43.817 --> 04:46.520
so this is the kind of thing
that matters to him,

04:46.587 --> 04:49.056
but more importantly,
he is my friend.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.624
He's gonna be
really proud of me.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.361
Man, I finally got
one of those watches
that counts your steps.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.762
What took me so long?

04:54.828 --> 04:56.397
217, 218...

04:56.464 --> 04:58.466
Hey, Dr. Ken,
I passed my boards.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.000
I'm a registered
nurse now.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.101
That's amazing!

05:01.902 --> 05:03.136
It knew when I stopped!

05:03.203 --> 05:04.204
219, 220.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.742
(DEEP VOICE) He seems
really happy for you.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.216
Oh, well, good,
you're all here.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.318
I have some delightful news
to share.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.120
You're dying?
They're replacing you
with a human?

05:20.187 --> 05:21.789
Mustaches are cool again?

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
You were able to wipe
your hard drive
before the feds got to it?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.860
How about I just tell you?

05:26.927 --> 05:30.864
Our own Dr. Park
received another
patient-complaint form.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.099
This being his third strike,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.167
he is now required
to attend physician...

05:34.935 --> 05:36.937
..sensitivity training.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.707
What, the bedside-manners
seminar?

05:39.773 --> 05:40.841
No!

05:40.908 --> 05:43.210
That thing's like
traffic school
for doctors.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.445
Mmm-hmm.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.114
My assistant will send you
the "deets."

05:47.180 --> 05:49.583
I don't have an assistant,
so I'll just tell you.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.219
There's a session tonight
at 5:00 right downstairs.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.854
No, I'm not doing it.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.789
I mean, what are they
gonna do to me
if I don't go?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.157
I guess the worst thing
that can happen is

05:57.224 --> 05:58.692
you get called up
by the board of review

05:58.759 --> 06:00.561
and possibly lose
your medical license.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.596
Come on, Pat,
that's redonkulous.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.097
(LAUGHS)

06:04.164 --> 06:05.799
There's got to be something
you can do.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.235
(SIGHS) I wish I could...

06:08.301 --> 06:10.438
(CHUCKLING)
...make this moment
last forever.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.247
(PHONE RINGS)

06:20.313 --> 06:22.382
Chello.
Why haven't you
left yet?

06:22.450 --> 06:23.984
You're not gonna believe
the hell I'm in.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.319
They're making me go to this
stupid bedside-manner seminar.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.655
Oh, that's your hell?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.156
I'm in real hell, Ken.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.259
Your parents are here,
and I'm getting Rushmored
so hard right now.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.531
I'm sorry.
As a doctor, things come up.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.467
Look, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.469
But you're my buffer!

06:41.535 --> 06:44.472
Get your ass home
and start buffing.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.774
Why do you always
have to take it
to a sexual place?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.008
Hello?

06:53.280 --> 06:56.116
(SIGHS)
Hi. I'm Dr. Ken Park.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.285
James Miller,
chief happiness officer.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.955
So, how long does this
huckleberry usually take?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.591
Four hours...

07:03.657 --> 07:05.459
With a break in the middle
for snacks.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.528
Look, um, Jimbo,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.663
I got a thing
with the wife
at the hiz-o.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.632
(CHUCKLES)

07:11.699 --> 07:14.668
Is there any way
this whole deal-io
could go a tad quicker?

07:14.735 --> 07:17.605
People, Dr. Park here
doesn't want you
to have snacks!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.207
Everybody okay
with that?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.242
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.513
No, I was just thinking
maybe snacks to go,
like, at the end?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.847
I like to eat mine here.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.817
I'm also gonna be
eating yours.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.252
Seems fair.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.192
Does anyone want to
switch seats with me?

07:40.694 --> 07:41.862
I will.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.864
Okay, you know,
that doesn't help me.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.514
Ken should be no later
than 7:30.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.652
Just FYI.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.625
(WHISPERS)
What time is it?

08:11.692 --> 08:12.826
6:36.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.930
So, Grandma,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.332
did I tell you
I got my license?

08:19.399 --> 08:20.568
How's school?

08:21.569 --> 08:22.770
Well, some of the classes
are pretty...

08:22.836 --> 08:24.037
You like a boy?

08:27.975 --> 08:30.477
So, Ken tells me a bunch of
small pets have been eaten

08:30.544 --> 08:32.412
by coyotes
in your neighborhood.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.747
How's that going?

08:33.814 --> 08:34.982
So-so.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.324
6:37.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.463
This is nice.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.838
Remember, you can't
help a patient

08:57.905 --> 09:00.507
unless you are patient.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.175
(COUGHING) Cliche.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.111
Okay, let's change it up
a little,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.346
and since Dr. Park
seems to have
so much to say,

09:06.413 --> 09:09.883
let's do a role-play
where he has to
deliver bad news.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.519
I'll be the patient.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.724
So, what's wrong
with me, Doc?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.291
Well,
your tests came back,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.060
and I'm very sorry
to tell you that...

09:20.127 --> 09:22.495
Why aren't you also
looking at my wife?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.831
I didn't know your wife
was here.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.800
I, uh, um...
Welcome. Hi, Mrs. James.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.468
Um, glad you could make it.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.338
Uh, anyway, the results
of your CAT Scan showed...

09:31.404 --> 09:32.472
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:32.539 --> 09:34.074
Why didn't you
catch this problem

09:34.141 --> 09:35.943
when I came in
for my physical
three months ago?

09:36.009 --> 09:39.346
Um, was there a physical
three months ago?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.882
Really, you forgot
about my physical?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.516
Oh, no! I... I...
No, I didn't!

09:43.583 --> 09:45.285
No, I... I... You told me.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.254
I... I know this must be
a very difficult time
for you and your hus...

09:47.320 --> 09:49.289
Why are you staring
at my wife?

09:49.356 --> 09:52.359
No, I mean, you said
I was supposed to make
eye contact with her.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.029
Are you flirting
with my wife...

09:56.096 --> 09:58.632
...while you tell me
I have cancer?

09:58.699 --> 10:00.634
Why would I flirt
with your fat, ugly wife

10:00.701 --> 10:02.169
when you only have
six months to live?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.336
(GASPS)

10:06.173 --> 10:07.841
Okay.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.711
Who here thinks
Dr. Park did a good job
delivering the news?

10:18.485 --> 10:19.687
Ugh!

10:19.753 --> 10:22.656
That seminar was the worst
four hours of my life,

10:22.723 --> 10:25.859
and that includes the time
I flew back from Tampa
next to Jeremy Piven.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.060
Mmm. I would've walked.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.528
Right?

10:28.595 --> 10:30.597
And then when I got home,
Allison was furious at me

10:30.664 --> 10:32.766
for missing dinner
with my parents.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.535
Why I chose that moment
to try to fool around
with her I have no idea.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.372
But at least
I got to figure out

10:39.439 --> 10:41.241
who filed
that last complaint.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.911
I'll file one of my own
if you don't wrap
this story up.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.680
It was that noncompliant,

10:46.747 --> 10:49.282
fish-oily,
samurai-topknot moron Sonja.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.686
Anyway,
who do I have first?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.787
Let me give you a hint.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.122
Samurai topknot.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.227
Oh, look who it is.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.428
Sonja.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.896
Nice to see you again.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.765
I gained another pound.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.201
Huh. Let's see here.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.637
Oh, your blood pressure
is cowardly,

11:10.704 --> 11:13.373
your thyroid level
is deceitful,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.342
and I studied your x-ray
for an hour,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.110
but I couldn't find
a backbone!

11:17.945 --> 11:19.847
What's with the hostility?

11:19.913 --> 11:22.349
And why are you being
so creative about it?

11:23.951 --> 11:25.719
I know what you did.
CLARK: Dr. Ken.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.120
And you know
what you did.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.655
Dr. Ken!

11:28.722 --> 11:29.990
And if you think you can
just walk in here and...

11:30.057 --> 11:31.925
She didn't file
the complaint, I did.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.897
Okay, Sonja,
you're doing great.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.398
Keep taking
your synthroid every day.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.567
Say hi to Shep for me.
Okay, be well.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.503
I'll see you. Bye.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.073
You filed
a patient-complaint form
against me?

11:46.139 --> 11:48.141
I thought perhaps
you could use some help

11:48.208 --> 11:49.542
with how you treat people.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.244
I know how to deal
with patients.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.613
I'm not...
I'm not talking about
your bedside manner.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.349
I'm talking about your
"Friend-side" manner.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.686
And I did not know that
you were gonna have to
go to some seminar

11:59.753 --> 12:01.721
or about the whole
four-strikes thing.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.356
It's three strikes!

12:03.423 --> 12:04.892
I'm not a baseball guy!

12:04.958 --> 12:06.059
It's three strikes!

12:06.126 --> 12:07.460
You don't have to be
a baseball guy!

12:07.527 --> 12:09.396
I was homeschooled.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.898
Where, outer space?

12:10.964 --> 12:13.033
No! Cooperstown,
New York!

12:13.100 --> 12:15.468
Cooperstown, New York?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.805
Home of the
Baseball Hall of Fame?

12:19.807 --> 12:21.875
Clark, if you had
a problem with me,

12:21.942 --> 12:23.643
you should've talked
to me about it.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.645
I tried!

12:25.712 --> 12:28.215
I always try,
but you never listen.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.349
You don't care,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.451
even when it is
something as important

12:31.518 --> 12:33.453
as me becoming
a registered nurse!

12:33.520 --> 12:35.122
So I didn't throw you
a parade.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.124
As a doctor,
I have a lot on my plate.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.993
Look, I may not pay attention
to every little thing you say,

12:40.060 --> 12:41.862
but one thing
I would never do...

12:41.929 --> 12:43.964
Well, two if you include
a devil's threesome...

12:45.165 --> 12:47.300
...is sell out a friend.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.137
Damona,
I want a new nurse...
(GASPS)

12:50.203 --> 12:52.472
Preferably one
who's not a rat.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.042
Well, that works out
great for me

12:55.108 --> 12:57.044
because I want
a new doctor,

12:57.110 --> 13:00.613
preferably one
who treats his nurse
like a human being!

13:05.018 --> 13:06.519
You go that way,
I'll go this way!

13:06.586 --> 13:08.021
Fine!
Good!

13:10.958 --> 13:12.759
The thing is, I really
needed to go this way.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.934
Dr. Ken,
this is your nurse, Rick.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.269
Dr. Sawyer,
this is your nurse, Clark.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.603
Have fun.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.783
(PHONE RINGS)

14:12.219 --> 14:13.686
Hey, Allison.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.555
(CHUCKLING)
You won't believe
what a sucky day I've had.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.257
(SARCASTICALLY)
Aw, I wish I could
feel sorry for you,

14:17.324 --> 14:18.959
but I can't.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.793
'Cause guess
who's here again,
the frickin' fun bunch.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.263
And guess what,
they brought
their stink eye.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.368
I felt guilty
about missing dinner,

14:28.435 --> 14:30.037
so I invited them
back tonight.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.005
Guess I forgot to tell you.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.941
Great. Super.
Just get home.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.944
Okay, so, this next thing's
really gonna feel like
kerosene on a flame,

14:37.010 --> 14:40.347
but I have that seminar
again tonight.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.016
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna kill you.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.451
Do you realize how...

14:44.517 --> 14:45.986
Cell...cutting...

14:46.053 --> 14:47.520
Out.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.322
We're both on landlines,
dum-dum.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.226
Landline... Cutting...out.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.698
Hey, guys, what's up?

14:58.765 --> 15:01.368
(CHUCKLING)
So, the drought.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.572
That thing just rages on
unabated, huh?

15:07.774 --> 15:09.209
Hey, here's something.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.912
How's, uh...
How's Dr. Ken doing
with his new...nurse?

15:13.813 --> 15:15.182
Great!

15:15.248 --> 15:16.950
They're going away together
to palm springs this weekend.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.451
Really?
Nope.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.687
Oh, thank god.
I mean, whatevs.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.721
It's all good.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.358
Please, Clark!
Stop this madness!

15:26.459 --> 15:28.728
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.063
I went into the exam room,

15:30.130 --> 15:32.132
and Dr. Ken was there
with that other nurse,

15:32.199 --> 15:33.800
and they were draining
an abscess,

15:33.866 --> 15:36.036
and it made
me physically ill

15:36.103 --> 15:40.207
because that should've
been Dr. Ken and you!

15:42.242 --> 15:45.312
Dr. Ken drains abscesses
with someone else now.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.082
Do something!
What do you want me
to do?

15:49.149 --> 15:50.450

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985

Always got me
in people's business.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.891
Hey.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.360
Do you remember
when you asked Dr. Ken

16:00.427 --> 16:02.329
to write you
a recommendation
for the RN. Program?

under advisement.

Aw. I can't believe
Dr. Ken wrote all those
beautiful words.

He didn't.
I wrote it, he signed it.

What's your deal?

nothing to say to me.

You push your food around
on your plate.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.688
Yeah, I noticed.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.626
Uh... I like a boy.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.896
Why don't you like me?

I'm not good enough
for your son?

Oh, no, sometimes we think
Ken not good enough for you.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.361
He does, constantly.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.796

he actually said,

be here tonight

have to yell.

have feelings, too.

is February 29th,

that you're 10...

for your nursing boards
since last summer,

picked last for kickball,

I know and appreciate
all you do for me.

I got this.

has a nurse.

those things about me?

a pretty safe guess.

hugging yourself?

with my parents again.

It actually wasn't so bad
this time.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.661
Yeah, it was kind of fun.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.531
So, how was rage camp?

21:06.499 --> 21:07.967
You know,
I actually learned a little

21:08.034 --> 21:09.469
about how to treat
people better,

21:09.536 --> 21:11.604
which is important
because, as a doctor...

21:11.671 --> 21:13.906
He said it!
He said it!

21:13.973 --> 21:15.274
Everybody gets a dollar!

21:15.342 --> 21:16.376
Yay!

21:16.443 --> 21:18.010
You get a dollar,
you get a dollar.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.512
No.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.681
You don't get a dollar
'cause you too arrogant.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.082
(ALL LAUGHING)
