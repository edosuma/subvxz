WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:02.029
I'm Mr. Magnum's manservant.

00:03.409 --> 00:06.139
I'm moving... out.

00:08.348 --> 00:11.681
I'll have my financial advisers
get in touch with you.

00:11.718 --> 00:13.049
Financial advisers?

00:13.953 --> 00:16.318
Oui.

00:16.356 --> 00:18.221
You will pay for this.

00:18.257 --> 00:19.383
Aargh!

00:20.393 --> 00:23.453
- I was gonna go straight to bed.
- How convenient.

00:23.496 --> 00:26.226
There's no question
that your benefactor was cruel.

00:26.265 --> 00:29.530
There always seemed
to be something evil here.

01:43.676 --> 01:46.474
I personally checked out
your new aircraft, sir.

01:46.512 --> 01:48.912
- No bombs, huh?
- No, sir.

01:52.585 --> 01:55.645
Carlton, sometimes I don't think
you have a sense of humor.

01:55.688 --> 02:00.716
You know what they say about the British.
I've been known to enjoy a good joke.

02:01.394 --> 02:02.725
Hey, what's this?

02:05.631 --> 02:08.691
You been sneaking food again, huh?

02:08.734 --> 02:11.999
I'll get that sense of humor yet,
Mr. MacLeish.

02:25.718 --> 02:27.709
- Simon.
- Carlton.

02:29.989 --> 02:31.388
What do you want?

02:31.424 --> 02:35.190
As estate bursar,
I must protest your purchase of this toy.

02:35.228 --> 02:39.221
It's not a toy. It's stressed for
seven Gs positive and three negative.

02:39.265 --> 02:42.530
- You can't afford it, sir.
- I've already paid for it.

02:42.568 --> 02:44.695
You're spending principal.

02:44.737 --> 02:46.864
Principal? Interest? So what?

02:46.906 --> 02:50.967
The difference, Uncle Wilson,
is that you are destroying a fortune.

02:51.010 --> 02:55.310
A fortune that took this family
generations to build.

02:55.348 --> 02:58.283
It's mine to destroy if I want to, isn't it?

02:58.718 --> 03:01.846
Yes, but there are other people to consider.

03:02.522 --> 03:05.889
Are you afraid
there won't be any of the pie left for you?

03:05.925 --> 03:08.655
Don't worry.
There'll be something in the will.

03:09.762 --> 03:11.161
You did check for bombs?

03:11.197 --> 03:15.190
Yes, sir. I went over the plane
with the proverbial fine tooth comb.

03:16.202 --> 03:17.499
Well, ta-ta.

03:17.537 --> 03:20.301
Sir? About Sunday...

03:21.374 --> 03:25.003
- What about it?
- I mentioned it. My godson's baptism.

03:25.044 --> 03:27.308
I need you on the skeet range.

03:28.581 --> 03:32.210
Have Simon give the little nipper
a sawbuck on me. Aloha.

03:32.685 --> 03:33.674
Hey, Steve!

04:38.217 --> 04:39.707
Where'd he go?

05:23.029 --> 05:24.724
Magnum.

05:24.764 --> 05:27.255
Magnum!

05:27.300 --> 05:28.733
Magnum!

05:29.068 --> 05:30.831
Hi, Higgins.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.464
How fiendishly deceptive, Magnum.

05:33.506 --> 05:37.670
I could have sworn I was hearing
the emasculation of a large rodent.

05:38.277 --> 05:41.075
To my surprise,
I see the sounds are emanating

05:41.113 --> 05:44.640
from what I thought
was a harmless musical instrument.

05:44.684 --> 05:46.675
Cute, Higgins. Real cute.

05:51.057 --> 05:52.718
Why, Magnum?

05:53.726 --> 05:55.455
Why do this terrible thing?

05:55.494 --> 06:00.193
I used to be good. I was second best
sax player in my high school band.

06:00.966 --> 06:02.957
How many sax players were there?

06:05.371 --> 06:08.067
Anyway, I just saw this
in a pawn shop window

06:08.107 --> 06:10.575
and thought I'd like to get my chops back.

06:10.609 --> 06:13.510
May I suggest that your chops
are irretrievable?

06:13.546 --> 06:16.140
Did you come here just to abuse me?

06:16.182 --> 06:17.843
No. I came on two accounts.

06:17.883 --> 06:20.943
First, reimbursement
for Mr. Masters' telescope

06:20.986 --> 06:23.386
which you destroyed on your last case.

06:23.422 --> 06:26.448
I still don't understand
how it could have melted.

06:26.492 --> 06:29.689
That requires a temperature
of 1,300 degrees centigrade.

06:29.729 --> 06:33.529
That's 2,372 degrees Fahrenheit,
if you need a conversion.

06:33.566 --> 06:36.296
I told you. The guy had a blowtorch.

06:36.335 --> 06:38.997
I can't pay you because I haven't been paid.

06:39.038 --> 06:42.064
- But you bought the saxophone.
- That's right.

06:42.742 --> 06:47.076
Let me understand. You have not
been remunerated for your last case?

06:47.113 --> 06:48.102
Correct.

06:48.147 --> 06:52.948
But you admit you owe the estate $408
for the destruction of the telescope?

06:52.985 --> 06:56.546
Absolutely.
I can explain. It's all perfectly logical.

06:56.589 --> 06:59.717
Now, I owe the estate $408, right?

06:59.759 --> 07:02.250
- We've established that.
- OK.

07:02.294 --> 07:04.854
The saxophone only cost 120.

07:04.897 --> 07:09.231
That's all the money I had,
so I couldn't pay back the estate anyway.

07:11.404 --> 07:13.872
You said you came on two accounts.

07:13.906 --> 07:16.272
Yes...

07:18.644 --> 07:22.375
Forgive me for intruding...
but we are in a hurry.

07:25.751 --> 07:30.051
- Benton Quirk, Wilson MacLeish's attorney.
- Thomas Magnum.

07:30.089 --> 07:32.922
- You knew Wilson MacLeish?
- I did a case for him.

07:32.958 --> 07:36.917
I was sorry to hear about the accident.
What can I do for you?

07:36.962 --> 07:39.157
Would you accompany me?

07:40.399 --> 07:43.926
- Accompany you where?
- To the reading of Mr. MacLeish's will.

07:48.674 --> 07:51.336
He was still so young.

07:51.377 --> 07:53.675
So full of life.

07:55.014 --> 07:57.312
I remember when he was a boy.

07:58.517 --> 08:02.419
All us cousins used to get together
at Christmas time

08:02.455 --> 08:04.480
and sing carols.

08:06.926 --> 08:08.917
Silent Night...

08:10.229 --> 08:14.598
Yeah. Silent Night was Wilson's favorite.

08:17.336 --> 08:21.500
* Silent night... *

08:21.540 --> 08:24.873
* Holy night

08:24.910 --> 08:29.006
* All is calm

08:29.048 --> 08:31.846
* All is...

08:33.318 --> 08:35.183
- * All is... *
- Bright.

08:35.221 --> 08:38.486
Thank you. *.. bright *

08:38.524 --> 08:41.721
- * Round yon... *
- Oh, turn off the tap, Marina!

08:41.760 --> 08:45.787
Tears won't do you any good now.
Besides, you never could sing.

08:47.032 --> 08:49.159
I can't believe you, Tony.

08:49.201 --> 08:51.101
You are so cold.

08:51.136 --> 08:54.902
- I mean, after all, he was your brother.
- Half-brother.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.771
And it's easy to be cold.

08:56.809 --> 09:00.677
Wilson's mother was married to
a MacLeish. Mine wasn't.

09:00.713 --> 09:03.807
- You sit there.
- It's about time, Benton.

09:03.849 --> 09:05.840
Sorry we're late.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.815
Thank you all for coming.

09:20.132 --> 09:22.259
This is perhaps a bit unorthodox,

09:22.301 --> 09:24.565
but it was stipulated by the deceased.

09:30.476 --> 09:31.670
<i>Fore!</i>

09:31.710 --> 09:33.405
<i>Whoops!</i>

09:34.113 --> 09:37.173
<i>Too hard. OK. Take two</i>.

09:37.216 --> 09:39.707
<i>Howdy doody, partners</i>.

09:39.752 --> 09:44.086
<i>It's giveaway time, guys,
so let's not waste any time, shall we?</i>

09:44.857 --> 09:48.088
- What is this?
- Mr. MacLeish wanted to read his will.

09:48.127 --> 09:51.119
I have the proper documents
to corroborate it.

09:53.165 --> 09:56.191
<i>I'm gonna get serious now.
I hope you don't mind.</i>

09:57.636 --> 10:01.504
<i>I, Wilson Oliver MacLeish,
being of sound mind and memory</i>

10:01.540 --> 10:05.067
<i>and not acting under duress,
menace or undue influence,</i>

10:05.110 --> 10:10.013
<i>do make, publish and declare this,
my last will and testament.</i>

10:10.049 --> 10:12.040
<i>To my faithful manservant, Carlton,</i>

10:12.084 --> 10:16.578
<i>I bequeath the sum of $40,000
and my collection of English hunting prints.</i>

10:16.622 --> 10:18.453
Oh.

10:18.490 --> 10:20.720
How generous.

10:20.759 --> 10:25.093
<i>To my gardener, Hiroshi Takai,
I bequeath the sum of $10,000</i>

10:25.130 --> 10:28.031
<i>and the pickup truck
which I purchased for his use.</i>

10:28.067 --> 10:30.627
Oh, beautiful.

10:30.669 --> 10:33.137
<i>To my loyal housekeeper, Ruth Steelman,</i>

10:33.172 --> 10:35.538
<i>I bequeath the sum of $10,000</i>

10:35.574 --> 10:38.975
<i>and the small Rodin bronze
in my sitting room. OK, Ruth?</i>

10:39.011 --> 10:41.844
Isn't there anything
about family members?

10:41.880 --> 10:44.144
- Tony...
- He's coming to that.

10:44.950 --> 10:47.783
<i>Now.</i> .. <i>for my beloved family</i>.

10:49.421 --> 10:52.254
<i>To my illegitimate half-brother,
Anthony Silvano,</i>

10:52.291 --> 10:56.387
<i>in order to help him maintain the fa√ßade
that's so important to him,</i>

10:56.428 --> 11:01.024
<i>I bequeath my complete wardrobe
of dress clothes,</i>

11:01.066 --> 11:03.091
<i>including my matching velvet pumps</i>.

11:03.902 --> 11:06.166
- Is that all?
- <i>No</i>.

11:07.272 --> 11:11.072
<i>You also get my bubblegum
trading card collection</i>

11:11.110 --> 11:14.341
<i>of the 1959 Washington Senators,</i>

11:14.380 --> 11:19.079
<i>including a baseball
personally signed by Hoyt Wilhelm.</i>

11:19.852 --> 11:24.118
He can't be serious. This is a joke.
You're lucky you're dead!

11:24.156 --> 11:25.646
<i>Same to you</i>.

11:27.059 --> 11:30.051
<i>To my nephew, Simon MacLeish,</i>

11:30.095 --> 11:33.360
<i>who worries over every single penny,</i>

11:33.399 --> 11:37.529
<i>I bequeath the sum of $500
for the purchase of an adding machine.</i>

11:37.569 --> 11:39.036
What?

11:39.071 --> 11:42.097
<i>Batteries not included.</i>

11:46.178 --> 11:48.806
<i>To my cousin, Marina Pepesco</i>...

11:52.017 --> 11:56.784
<i>who has tried so unsuccessfully
and so often to marry money,</i>

11:56.822 --> 12:00.383
<i>I bequeath a membership
in the Software Computer Dating Club</i>

12:00.426 --> 12:04.863
<i>and a year of ballroom dancing lessons
at the studio of her choice.</i>

12:04.897 --> 12:06.956
There must be some mistake.

12:09.668 --> 12:11.659
- He must have been...
- <i>No, Marina</i>.

12:11.704 --> 12:14.229
<i>I was not drunk when I made the will</i>.

12:14.273 --> 12:16.264
<i>But I'll bet you will be</i>...

12:17.276 --> 12:18.800
<i>in about an hour?</i>

12:18.844 --> 12:22.644
How dare he?
After everything! How dare he?

12:22.681 --> 12:24.376
Oh, sit down, Marina.

12:24.416 --> 12:27.408
Theatrics will not get you another dime.

12:30.255 --> 12:32.246
<i>The remainder of my estate,</i>

12:32.291 --> 12:37.228
<i>including all cash, properties,
bonds, artworks and household pets,</i>

12:37.262 --> 12:40.857
<i>I bequeath
to Mr. Thomas Sullivan Magnum.</i>

12:44.303 --> 12:45.565
<i>Aloha</i>.

12:57.915 --> 12:59.974
- I have to live here?
- Yes.

13:00.017 --> 13:03.885
The will stipulates that Mr. Magnum take up
immediate residence

13:03.921 --> 13:07.687
and retain the current staff
for at least one year.

13:07.725 --> 13:09.317
This is ridiculous.

13:09.360 --> 13:14.491
You're gonna tell me he left all his money,
$50 million, to a total stranger?

13:14.531 --> 13:16.522
Not quite a stranger.

13:16.567 --> 13:19.229
Mr. Magnum performed a service
for Mr. MacLeish

13:19.270 --> 13:21.966
who, evidently, was quite satisfied.

13:22.006 --> 13:25.703
Carlton, sir. I look forward to serving you.

13:25.743 --> 13:29.008
- Hi, Mr. Carlton...
- Save all of that, buster.

13:29.046 --> 13:32.072
- I won't let this sit.
- We'll contest the will.

13:32.116 --> 13:33.981
- Wait a minute.
- You bet your...

13:34.018 --> 13:38.455
No, wait a minute. This came
as just as much of a surprise to me...

13:38.489 --> 13:41.549
- Sure. Big surprise.
- I hardly knew the man.

13:41.592 --> 13:44.117
- Well enough to fix the will.
- You cheat.

13:44.161 --> 13:47.597
I did not fix any will
and I'm not trying to cheat anybody.

13:47.631 --> 13:51.533
Fine. Will you then forthwith
renounce all claim to the estate?

13:52.670 --> 13:54.797
- I don't know.
- Just as I thought.

13:54.838 --> 13:58.501
Wait a minute. Wait.
We can work something out.

13:59.576 --> 14:02.010
Something fair. It's $50 million.

14:04.515 --> 14:07.006
$50 million...

14:09.153 --> 14:11.314
I mean, they do have a point.

14:12.323 --> 14:16.316
- It's for the courts to decide.
- We'll see you there, pal.

14:18.262 --> 14:20.890
Yeah. You got it?

14:27.004 --> 14:28.995
- Excuse us.
- Of course.

14:30.074 --> 14:33.635
Mr. MacLeish also wanted you to have
this videotape.

14:33.677 --> 14:36.703
I don't know what's on it,
but he left instructions

14:36.747 --> 14:40.205
that you were not to look at it
until after you moved in.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.446
Congratulations, Mr. Magnum.

14:44.521 --> 14:47.684
And, uh, if you ever need my services...

14:50.427 --> 14:53.362
"Benton Quirk". No, wait! I do have some...

14:53.397 --> 14:57.527
Mr. Magnum, I hope
you will forgive my presumption. May I?

14:57.568 --> 14:58.660
What?

14:58.702 --> 15:00.533
Your hat, sir.

15:01.171 --> 15:03.105
Oh.

15:03.140 --> 15:08.339
You are not accustomed to all this.
Accustomed to having money.

15:08.379 --> 15:10.745
- Are you?
- Sort of.

15:12.316 --> 15:16.685
Well, not exactly.
I mean, not my own money.

15:17.888 --> 15:21.449
It's no crime, sir. May I?
Your coat, please.

15:25.529 --> 15:29.932
You simply need... different sensibilities.

15:31.001 --> 15:34.095
Mr. Magnum, may I show you some things?

15:34.138 --> 15:35.127
This way, sir.

15:38.342 --> 15:39.832
$50 million!

15:42.279 --> 15:47.512
A Van Gogh... Picasso...
Monet and a Renoir.

15:47.551 --> 15:50.145
Wilson's father had genuine taste in art.

15:50.187 --> 15:54.180
Wilson himself preferred pictures
of little children with big eyes.

15:54.224 --> 15:56.920
The art in the house
is worth over $10 million,

15:56.960 --> 16:00.521
not to mention
the Chinese porcelain, the silver,

16:00.564 --> 16:06.230
the MacLeish stamp collection
and even Wilson's gun collection.

16:06.270 --> 16:09.103
It's amazing that one
who was so miserable a shot

16:09.139 --> 16:12.939
should take
such a rabid interest in firearms.

16:12.976 --> 16:15.308
Excuse me. There you are, sir.

16:16.313 --> 16:19.976
- That's a 17th-century duelling piece.
- A Lipscomb.

16:21.051 --> 16:23.781
- May I?
- They're all yours now, sir.

16:33.831 --> 16:35.526
I'm sorry, sir.

16:36.066 --> 16:39.160
Another of Wilson MacLeish's legacies.

16:39.203 --> 16:42.104
He fancied himself
a peerless practical joker.

16:42.806 --> 16:44.933
As you can see, I'm dying laughing.

16:44.975 --> 16:50.038
Of course. This, however, is my favorite.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.777
A Colt.45, vintage 1860.

16:58.755 --> 17:00.746
There we are. Excuse me, sir.

17:02.292 --> 17:06.661
The latest appraisal
of the entire collection was $600,000,

17:06.696 --> 17:11.531
but that was years ago
and I'm sure the value has risen since then.

17:12.536 --> 17:15.198
This is just a part of the fortune.

17:15.239 --> 17:17.138
It's all yours...

17:17.174 --> 17:21.234
and others will try to get a piece of it
any way they can.

17:22.378 --> 17:28.079
OK, this is all quite... weird.
Now you can tell me why he left it to me.

17:28.952 --> 17:30.783
Actually, I've no idea, sir.

17:30.821 --> 17:34.882
Other than the fact that
Mr. MacLeish found in you an honest man

17:34.925 --> 17:36.916
who did not take advantage of him.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.862
He may have decided to reward you
at the expense of his relatives.

17:40.898 --> 17:45.494
I suppose that would be
his ultimate... practical joke.

17:45.536 --> 17:51.338
There's no question that your benefactor
was capricious, even cruel.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.366
This way, sir.

17:56.513 --> 17:58.572
To be quite honest with you,

17:58.615 --> 18:02.312
I'm not sure
that Mr. MacLeish's death was an accident.

18:02.352 --> 18:06.846
- Do the police know that?
- Oh, I have no evidence. Only intuition.

18:06.890 --> 18:09.324
I'm not particularly metaphysical,

18:09.359 --> 18:13.728
but there always seemed to be
something evil here - in this house.

18:13.764 --> 18:18.326
Perhaps I'm just a bit... superstitious,
what with all the deaths.

18:18.368 --> 18:19.460
Deaths?

18:19.503 --> 18:21.334
Yes. For all their money,

18:21.371 --> 18:24.807
the McLeishs
tend to die young and unpleasantly.

18:24.841 --> 18:27.401
However, I'm sure you'll break that tradition.

18:27.444 --> 18:29.605
After all, you're not a MacLeish.

18:31.048 --> 18:35.451
By the way, sir. The caterer called
regarding the masquerade ball.

18:35.485 --> 18:39.785
- Masquerade ball?
- Mr. MacLeish held one every year.

18:39.823 --> 18:43.259
In the ballroom. It's a tradition, sir.

18:43.293 --> 18:45.887
You are now the head of this house.

18:47.097 --> 18:49.565
- I don't know.
- It is expected.

18:52.135 --> 18:55.298
Oh-ho, here are Tristan and Isolde.

18:55.339 --> 18:58.831
Mr. MacLeish's only friends.
Now they're yours.

19:00.844 --> 19:04.974
It's quite odd.
They're usually quite friendly.

19:05.015 --> 19:07.984
Will you be moving in any pets of your own?

19:10.387 --> 19:13.686
Oh, yes, absolutely. We are taking that.

19:13.724 --> 19:16.488
- Let me relieve you.
- Thank you.

19:30.841 --> 19:33.275
What the bloody hell is going on?

19:39.149 --> 19:41.811
I'm moving... out.

19:45.989 --> 19:50.289
- You're what?
- I'm moving out.

19:51.094 --> 19:52.561
Well...

19:53.296 --> 19:57.392
that's certainly delightful news, Magnum,
but isn't it unfeasible?

19:57.434 --> 20:00.528
You can't even afford
to replace Mr. Masters' telescope.

20:00.570 --> 20:01.969
I had a windfall.

20:02.005 --> 20:04.838
A few crumpled dollar bills
found in a pocket,

20:04.875 --> 20:06.934
or has this gentleman taken you in?

20:06.977 --> 20:10.174
- Quite the reverse, actually.
- Oh, Carlton...

20:11.181 --> 20:14.309
this is Higgins.
He's the major-domo around here.

20:14.351 --> 20:16.751
Higgins, this is Carlton. He's my...

20:17.921 --> 20:18.945
friend.

20:18.989 --> 20:23.983
You don't have to make excuses, sir.
I'm Mr. Magnum's manservant.

20:27.364 --> 20:30.822
Really, Magnum,
the lengths you'll go to for a joke.

20:30.867 --> 20:34.098
How did you acquire this manservant?

20:34.137 --> 20:35.798
I inherited him.

20:36.606 --> 20:38.801
Yes, of course. The will.

20:38.842 --> 20:42.369
I suppose you inherited
the entire MacLeish fortune?

20:42.412 --> 20:43.811
Just about.

20:46.783 --> 20:48.774
Congratulations, old buddy.

20:48.819 --> 20:51.310
I always knew my boy would make good.

20:52.989 --> 20:55.219
Perfect. The supporting players.

20:55.258 --> 20:59.456
You can finish without the audience.
I have more important things to do...

20:59.496 --> 21:03.728
I say, Higgins, if you're leaving,
would you lend a hand?

21:03.767 --> 21:06.429
- There's a good chap.
- What?

21:07.437 --> 21:11.567
I say that I would appreciate
a little bit of brotherly assistance.

21:13.410 --> 21:16.971
If there is the slightest validity
to what I am witnessing,

21:17.013 --> 21:21.006
I can now be certain
that our creator is not only indifferent,

21:21.051 --> 21:22.712
he is cruel.

21:29.793 --> 21:33.752
- Not very sporting of him, eh, what?
- I'll help you with the bags.

21:33.797 --> 21:36.527
No, sir. I can manage -
however many trips.

21:37.567 --> 21:40.035
I'm sorry. Carlton, this is Orville Wright.

21:40.070 --> 21:42.834
- Sir.
- No, this is Orville.

21:42.873 --> 21:45.068
This is Theodore Calvin.

21:45.108 --> 21:47.474
- Might you...?
- Yeah, sure.

21:47.511 --> 21:50.571
- Thank you very much.
- A gentleman's gentleman.

21:50.614 --> 21:53.310
I'm not gonna come down on you
like a vulture.

21:53.350 --> 21:55.409
- Guys...
- Neither am I.

21:55.452 --> 22:00.151
In fact, I'm gonna destroy the past.
Your bar tabs.

22:02.192 --> 22:05.218
Your gas bills - they are ancient history.

22:05.262 --> 22:08.789
- I want you to think about tax shelters...
- Rick...

22:08.832 --> 22:12.268
- You ought to invest in aviation, tourism.
- T.C.

22:13.036 --> 22:16.028
- Can I fly you somewhere?
- Run down some plates...?

22:16.072 --> 22:18.597
Guys, wait, please!

22:18.642 --> 22:20.940
This is very disappointing.

22:20.977 --> 22:22.877
What?

22:22.913 --> 22:24.904
All this hustle.

22:27.017 --> 22:30.111
But... maybe we can work something out.

22:30.153 --> 22:34.453
I'll have my financial advisers
get in touch with you next week.

22:34.491 --> 22:37.187
Financial advisers? We're your buddies.

22:37.227 --> 22:39.525
- Yeah.
- Of course you are.

22:39.563 --> 22:44.500
But things have been so hectic lately
that, frankly, all I want to do

22:44.534 --> 22:48.868
is go home to my nice, great big house

22:48.905 --> 22:53.308
and have a little drinky-poo
and watch some telly.

22:53.343 --> 22:54.674
Ta.

22:59.249 --> 23:00.910
<i>I know what you're thinking</i>.

23:00.951 --> 23:05.217
<i>Wilson MacLeish leaving me $50 million
was a practical joke.</i>

23:05.255 --> 23:09.055
<i>I had the feeling the real reason
was on the tape that he left me.</i>

23:09.092 --> 23:13.028
<i>I hoped it wasn't so funny
that I was gonna be left in stitches.</i>

23:22.472 --> 23:25.339
<i>How's the whisky, Magnum?</i>

23:25.375 --> 23:28.003
<i>That's OK. It's good stuff. You deserve it</i>.

23:28.044 --> 23:32.105
<i>If you're sitting in my favorite chair
with your feet on the ottoman,</i>

23:32.148 --> 23:35.709
<i>that means you've really moved in.
Congratulations.</i>

23:36.453 --> 23:38.148
<i>It also means</i>...

23:41.524 --> 23:43.924
<i>that I've been murdered</i>.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.827
<i>One of my relatives did it
for the inheritance.</i>

23:46.863 --> 23:49.957
<i>But I fooled him or her. I gave it to you</i>.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.901
<i>And now I want you to find out
which one of them it was.</i>

23:54.437 --> 23:56.428
<i>You owe it to me, Magnum</i>.

23:58.041 --> 24:00.202
<i>Or may I put it another way?</i>

24:00.243 --> 24:03.542
<i>This $50 million
is the biggest fee you'll ever get.</i>

24:05.982 --> 24:07.677
- Guess who?
- Aargh!

24:07.717 --> 24:11.278
Surprised you.

24:14.090 --> 24:17.218
You certainly did. How did you get in?

24:17.260 --> 24:20.423
Uh, Wilson gave me this.

24:21.498 --> 24:25.127
I thought that tonight
would be a good time to return it.

24:26.303 --> 24:28.931
It's, uh... Carlton's night off, isn't it?

24:29.940 --> 24:31.430
Yes, it is.

24:32.809 --> 24:34.106
So...

24:35.045 --> 24:36.034
there.

24:36.846 --> 24:40.373
Your house is now... impenetrable.

24:42.352 --> 24:44.115
Almost.

24:44.988 --> 24:48.651
You know, from the moment I first met you,

24:48.692 --> 24:51.456
I thought we could become... friends.

24:53.430 --> 24:55.421
How about making me a drink?

24:55.465 --> 24:57.865
Oh, well...

24:57.901 --> 25:00.301
I'm tired. I was gonna go straight to bed.

25:00.337 --> 25:02.328
How convenient.

25:05.208 --> 25:07.938
Look, maybe we could have
lunch sometime.

25:11.781 --> 25:14.306
Well, Mr. Magnum...

25:14.351 --> 25:16.785
if we go to court over the will,

25:16.820 --> 25:19.983
it could tie the assets up
for an awfully long time.

25:21.591 --> 25:25.652
So, what I would really like to do
is work something out.

25:25.695 --> 25:29.563
You know? Just... between... you and me.

25:32.435 --> 25:35.529
- What about your cousins?
- What they don't know...

25:35.572 --> 25:38.666
Won't hurt them?
I thought you might say that.

25:38.708 --> 25:40.801
Why don't I make you that drink?

25:42.912 --> 25:44.311
Scotch.

25:49.019 --> 25:50.850
Marina...

25:50.887 --> 25:56.382
what if I told you
that Wilson might have been murdered?

25:57.427 --> 25:58.826
Murdered?

25:58.862 --> 26:00.261
How dreadful.

26:02.365 --> 26:04.356
Do you have any idea who might...

26:05.535 --> 26:07.196
want to kill him?

26:08.204 --> 26:09.637
Simon or Tony.

26:10.273 --> 26:13.572
Either one would have done it
for the inheritance.

26:15.745 --> 26:17.975
They expected to be well remembered?

26:18.782 --> 26:20.181
We all did.

26:22.952 --> 26:26.353
You're not implying
that I might have killed Wilson?

26:26.389 --> 26:29.324
No. You just did.

26:36.066 --> 26:38.762
Marina...

26:38.802 --> 26:41.236
you've seen
too many Bette Davis movies.

26:41.271 --> 26:44.172
He was my cousin, damn it!

26:44.207 --> 26:47.574
I'm entitled to some of the fortune, not you!

26:47.610 --> 26:50.044
Why, I practically grew up in this house!

26:50.080 --> 26:52.446
Then you'll know how to let yourself out.

27:06.262 --> 27:08.594
<i>The house was old, but comfortable</i>...

27:08.631 --> 27:11.122
<i>if you liked sleeping in gymnasiums</i>.

27:11.935 --> 27:15.928
<i>That's why when the lights went out,
I knew something was up.</i>

27:16.673 --> 27:18.732
<i>Of course, I was prepared</i>.

27:56.479 --> 27:58.640
Aargh!

27:59.315 --> 28:01.306
Cut it out! Just cut it out!

28:32.815 --> 28:33.804
Aloha.

28:46.496 --> 28:48.794
Aargh!

28:58.140 --> 29:00.301
How did they know
you'd hit that step?

29:00.342 --> 29:02.833
That's about as clever as you can get.

29:02.878 --> 29:05.244
- Maybe they didn't.
- You think it was luck?

29:05.281 --> 29:08.910
- Sure. Bad luck - just an accident.
- Oh, come on, Thomas.

29:08.951 --> 29:13.251
It's an old house. Lights can go out,
floorboards can give way.

29:13.289 --> 29:16.019
Yeah, and things can go bump in the night.

29:16.058 --> 29:19.050
That's a murder attempt if I ever saw one.

29:19.095 --> 29:22.622
Yeah?
Then why didn't they try to finish me off?

29:22.665 --> 29:25.327
It's supposed to look accidental.

29:25.367 --> 29:28.029
- I wonder what they'll try next.
- Rick?!

29:28.070 --> 29:30.402
I saw a movie when they killed this guy.

29:30.439 --> 29:33.966
They threw an electric lawnmower
in the bathtub - bzzt!

29:35.077 --> 29:37.136
It fried him just like that.

29:37.179 --> 29:39.113
You better take showers.

29:40.249 --> 29:43.343
- Guys.
- Stay out of the kitchen too.

29:43.385 --> 29:45.819
All sorts of things can happen in there.

29:45.855 --> 29:49.814
- Gas, poisoning, garbage disposal.
- Garbage disposal?

29:49.859 --> 29:51.520
Uh-huh.

29:51.994 --> 29:56.124
Yeah. Look on the bright side -
at least nobody's shooting at you.

30:22.758 --> 30:25.022
- This is Mr. Magnum.
- Hello.

30:25.060 --> 30:27.927
Hello. So glad you could come.

30:27.963 --> 30:32.332
Oh, Mr. Magnum,
I knew we should not have oiled this visor.

30:38.541 --> 30:42.500
Tr√®s bien, Your Majesty.

30:42.545 --> 30:47.039
And it's so good to see Her Majesty.
You look divine.

30:47.783 --> 30:49.307
Just divine.

30:49.351 --> 30:52.411
He got my costume.
I'm not gonna forgive him for this.

30:54.690 --> 30:56.021
Oui.

30:56.058 --> 31:00.893
You will pay for this. You will pay
for this. You will both pay for this.

31:16.478 --> 31:19.208
Higgins! You came!

31:21.350 --> 31:24.615
I see wealth hasn't dimmed
your perspicacity.

31:24.653 --> 31:26.883
- My what?
- Never mind.

31:26.922 --> 31:28.913
I'm sure you remember Carlton.

31:28.958 --> 31:30.289
Higgins.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.858
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you.

31:35.497 --> 31:39.058
The reason I'm here -
the only reason I'm here -

31:39.101 --> 31:42.036
is that I'm duty-bound
by the charities involved.

31:42.071 --> 31:44.039
Of course.

31:44.073 --> 31:47.406
Now, however difficult
this may be for me to say,

31:47.443 --> 31:51.436
I have always found in you... well...

31:52.414 --> 31:53.745
character.

31:53.782 --> 31:56.546
I think you will do right
by this inheritance.

31:56.585 --> 31:59.452
Thank you, Higgins. I intend to.

32:00.556 --> 32:05.118
Good. I'll call you tomorrow
to discuss your contributions.

32:12.101 --> 32:15.229
We gotta do something
about that dummy Magnum.

32:15.271 --> 32:18.001
We are. I filed suit this morning.

32:18.040 --> 32:22.409
That'll only take forever.
Wilson really stuck it to us this time.

32:22.444 --> 32:24.935
You know, I always hated that jerk.

32:24.980 --> 32:29.110
When we were kids I loaned him my Johnny
Ray records and he never gave them back.

32:29.151 --> 32:33.315
I always figured that's OK
because he's my brother... kinda.

32:34.123 --> 32:38.059
I figured he'd always take care of me,
you know what I mean?

32:38.093 --> 32:39.958
I wish I had those records back.

32:39.995 --> 32:43.522
With $50 million
you can buy all the records you want.

32:43.565 --> 32:45.362
Simon, I need a drink.

32:50.873 --> 32:52.670
Thank you.

32:55.044 --> 32:58.775
Maybe you should try
and get to know Magnum a little better.

32:58.814 --> 33:01.749
I'll bet she already has.

33:03.852 --> 33:11.759
Carlton... try not to be obvious, but
take a look at that Grim Reaper over there.

33:12.594 --> 33:15.028
Do you remember him coming in?

33:16.265 --> 33:17.823
No, sir.

33:17.866 --> 33:20.801
- Any idea who he is?
- None.

33:24.940 --> 33:27.135
Shall I ask to see his invitation?

33:27.176 --> 33:29.838
No. I will.

33:30.846 --> 33:34.714
- What about the guests?
- Let them eat cake.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.965
All right. Put the papers down.

35:12.714 --> 35:14.511
Now take off the mask.

35:17.986 --> 35:20.113
You'll have to do it for the police.

35:20.622 --> 35:22.112
You do it.

35:46.248 --> 35:48.739
Come back here! Help!

35:50.652 --> 35:52.142
Help!

35:56.391 --> 35:57.881
Help!

35:59.428 --> 36:04.297
One shouldn't lie down in a suit of armor.
It's impossible to get up.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.200
I did not lie down, I was knocked down.

36:07.236 --> 36:12.401
I read about a knight in the Crusades
who was chasing a Saracen woman.

36:12.441 --> 36:16.309
He fell on his back while
amorously aroused and starved to death.

36:16.345 --> 36:18.745
Help me up before he gets away.

36:18.780 --> 36:20.645
- Who?
- The Grim Reaper.

36:20.682 --> 36:23.412
- He was stealing from the safe.
- How bizarre.

36:23.452 --> 36:24.919
Higgins!

36:28.790 --> 36:30.417
Aargh!

37:17.406 --> 37:18.395
Aargh!

37:30.919 --> 37:31.908
Agh!

37:39.394 --> 37:40.383
Aargh!

37:52.341 --> 37:54.468
Where am I? Where am I?

37:54.509 --> 37:56.409
Magnum?

37:58.714 --> 38:01.239
Higgins, where did he go?

38:11.756 --> 38:15.192
I still can't figure out
how the Grim Reaper got outta here.

38:15.229 --> 38:16.821
Seems obvious.

38:16.864 --> 38:20.561
Yeah. He scampered up the wall
and out that little window.

38:21.569 --> 38:23.400
- Not at all.
- What then?

38:23.438 --> 38:28.501
He broke down his molecular structure
and beamed himself to Waikiki?

38:28.543 --> 38:30.443
Magnum, it's so simple.

38:30.478 --> 38:36.474
A house of this period, designed, I believe,
by LeVassier - almost a standard fixture.

38:38.720 --> 38:42.121
A secret panel √† la Bela Lugosi? Come on.

38:42.724 --> 38:46.182
Precisely. The only problem is finding it.

38:46.227 --> 38:47.888
It might take...

38:50.631 --> 38:52.155
some time.

39:52.894 --> 39:54.623
Bubbly?

39:55.897 --> 40:00.027
Devigny P√®re et Fils '53.
Last case left in the world.

40:00.902 --> 40:02.699
Wilson MacLeish.

40:02.737 --> 40:04.932
In the flesh.

40:05.673 --> 40:08.141
- Why?
- Neat trick, huh?

40:08.176 --> 40:10.804
Hated to trash the plane, but c'est la vie.

40:10.845 --> 40:12.710
The best part was my funeral.

40:12.747 --> 40:16.478
Seeing all the gang, the crocodile tears,
phony speeches.

40:16.517 --> 40:19.918
I loved it. Hell, even the party was fun, man.

40:19.954 --> 40:22.286
Remind me to change the caterer, though.

40:22.323 --> 40:27.158
- Why?
- Because the food was terrible, man.

40:27.195 --> 40:31.461
That's not what Magnum means.
He wants to know why you did it.

40:31.499 --> 40:34.434
I suspected one of my relatives
was out to get me.

40:34.469 --> 40:36.596
Maybe I'm paranoid but I had to find out.

40:36.637 --> 40:38.867
So you made me a target?

40:38.906 --> 40:42.398
I thought you could catch the one
and then I'd reappear.

40:43.778 --> 40:45.905
I'm sorry about your leg, pal.

40:46.914 --> 40:51.908
That was me with the lights.
Got some wires crossed. It's an old house.

40:53.754 --> 40:55.745
Why risk showing yourself tonight?

40:55.790 --> 41:00.625
Partly to listen in on my relatives
and because I made one mistake.

41:01.529 --> 41:03.360
I left the real will in the safe!

41:03.397 --> 41:07.800
I knew Carlton would find out.
He knows everything, the meddling idiot.

41:07.835 --> 41:10.668
He knows now you weren't leaving him zip.

41:10.705 --> 41:14.197
Big deal.
He gets a pay check, room and board.

41:14.242 --> 41:20.306
Anyway, what do you think?
Which one was out to get me?

41:20.348 --> 41:25.012
I doubt if they were. But if they were,
I sure as hell wouldn't blame them.

41:25.052 --> 41:26.383
Magnum.

41:26.420 --> 41:30.186
Higgins, look at the way he uses people,
like more of his possessions.

41:30.224 --> 41:32.556
Carlton, his family, his relatives.

41:32.593 --> 41:34.390
They don't seem to mind.

41:34.428 --> 41:40.025
Well, they can't afford to.
But I mind. I mind a whole lot!

41:40.067 --> 41:43.833
- You set me up like a sitting duck.
- You had a good week.

41:44.705 --> 41:46.036
That's not the point!

41:46.073 --> 41:51.306
Oh, I get it. You were sore about the money.

41:54.782 --> 41:59.185
You didn't really think
I would leave you $50 million?

41:59.220 --> 42:02.189
That's not the point either!

42:02.223 --> 42:06.660
The point is
you are a worthless human being.

42:06.694 --> 42:09.162
Let's not be bitter about this.

42:09.197 --> 42:12.860
I'm gonna do right by you.
What do you say to 25 big ones?

42:14.635 --> 42:18.036
OK. 50. That'll buy a lot of Mai Tais.

42:20.975 --> 42:23.409
- I'll settle for this.
- What?

42:23.444 --> 42:26.936
- Magnum, don't. He's not worth it.
- Of course I'm not.

42:26.981 --> 42:29.074
Really!

42:31.385 --> 42:32.852
No.

42:36.857 --> 42:39.257
You can always drink Mai Tais.

42:47.101 --> 42:51.333
I had the perfect investment.
A $4 million condo deal on Bora Bora.

42:51.372 --> 42:54.170
I take a finder's fee of that and it's...

42:54.208 --> 42:57.177
- It's $240,000.
- Lost.

42:57.211 --> 43:01.204
That's just like you, Orville,
always thinking about yourself.

43:01.249 --> 43:03.911
- Now, me...
- Hi, guys.

43:03.951 --> 43:07.148
Don't "Hi, guys" us.
You owe the club a lot of money.

43:07.188 --> 43:10.521
I thought you were destroying the past.

43:10.558 --> 43:12.753
I just decided to reconstruct it.

43:12.793 --> 43:16.229
- And don't forget your gas bills either.
- T.C...

43:16.264 --> 43:19.097
- Don't look for sympathy.
- Let's get out of here.

43:19.133 --> 43:20.998
You can buy us a drink.

43:21.035 --> 43:24.004
Your manservant ain't serving today.

43:26.641 --> 43:29.303
You go ahead. I'll meet you at the club.

43:29.343 --> 43:31.334
- Why?
- Well...

43:33.848 --> 43:38.080
I just wanted
to have one last look at the place.

43:42.089 --> 43:45.183
You know, guys...

43:46.661 --> 43:49.858
for a while there, it was sorta nice.

43:55.903 --> 43:57.029
Nothing.

43:58.706 --> 44:00.367
No thing at all.

44:00.408 --> 44:02.603
You were leaving me nothing.

44:02.643 --> 44:06.306
That's not true. That's why
I was taking the will out of the safe.

44:06.347 --> 44:10.078
I realized that I'd overlooked you.
I was gonna call Quirk and put you in.

44:10.117 --> 44:13.177
- I'm telling it like it is.
- Please. "Tell it as it is."

44:13.220 --> 44:15.211
Don't die with wretched grammar.

44:15.256 --> 44:17.656
OK. As it is, pal.

44:17.692 --> 44:20.490
Good. Do you know
how long I've worked for you?

44:20.528 --> 44:24.862
- Sure. 15 years. 15 years or so...
- 25.

44:24.899 --> 44:27.367
25 miserable years I baby-sat you,

44:27.401 --> 44:30.165
I tolerated your humor,
I endured your jokes,

44:30.204 --> 44:33.037
I put you to bed when you were drunk,

44:33.074 --> 44:36.475
I fixed it with that... Hungarian acrobat...

44:36.510 --> 44:38.307
I know. Hey, hey.

44:38.346 --> 44:40.177
Now, she was really good.

44:40.214 --> 44:42.944
But not once did you ever thank me.

44:42.983 --> 44:45.975
I suppose
I didn't really expect thanks from you.

44:46.020 --> 44:50.719
Hey, I - I - I said thank you.
I remember that. A bunch of times!

44:50.758 --> 44:55.058
What I expected, however,
was just a little something in the will.

44:55.096 --> 44:56.791
Just a little something.

44:56.831 --> 45:00.995
Whether or not I lived to get it, wouldn't
matter, but to know that it was there.

45:01.035 --> 45:04.562
It'll be there. I swear it'll be there.

45:04.605 --> 45:08.006
And I swear, Mr. MacLeish,
that it is too late.

45:08.042 --> 45:10.670
There'll be a whole lot more.

45:10.711 --> 45:14.545
As much as you want.
Anything you want. Gimme a break!

45:14.582 --> 45:16.709
- Too late.
- Carlton!

45:19.587 --> 45:22.920
- Don't do it.
- Magnum, thank God.

45:22.957 --> 45:24.948
Mr. Magnum, stay out of this.

45:24.992 --> 45:28.450
- Give me the gun.
- Stay where you are.

45:28.496 --> 45:30.589
Sir, don't come any closer.

45:30.631 --> 45:34.533
- I shouldn't like to kill you too.
- I don't think you will.

45:53.287 --> 45:54.720
Very well.

45:56.056 --> 45:58.217
You shouldn't have stopped me.

45:58.259 --> 46:02.320
He's treated you as he treated everyone
else. Worse, he made you a target.

46:02.363 --> 46:05.764
- I can handle it.
- You won't regret it, I promise.

46:06.801 --> 46:10.601
Mr. Magnum,
do you realize if you kill him,

46:10.638 --> 46:13.334
you keep the fortune, everything?

46:13.374 --> 46:14.966
Carlton, you're fired.

46:17.378 --> 46:21.940
Isn't it ironic that if you save his life,
you lose everything?

46:21.982 --> 46:23.609
You'll never work again.

46:23.651 --> 46:28.145
What a wretched
and short-sighted morality you have.

46:28.189 --> 46:30.419
OK, Carlton, I'm gonna have you arrested!

46:31.525 --> 46:33.584
- Shut up!
- Magnum...

46:33.627 --> 46:37.461
- Do it. Do it.
- You wouldn't?

46:37.498 --> 46:40.365
You really think you'd be missed by anyone?

46:40.401 --> 46:42.926
- That isn't the point.
- Isn't it?

46:42.970 --> 46:47.100
All you have to prove your worth,
is the friends you leave behind.

46:47.141 --> 46:51.703
- I'm sorry about your leg, pal.
- And you don't seem to have any.

46:51.745 --> 46:55.806
You give people a motive, Wilson,
they might just kill you.

46:56.817 --> 47:00.776
- You won't get away with this.
- I won't tell anybody.

47:01.489 --> 47:04.287
Well, you just... No.

47:05.826 --> 47:07.521
No!

47:13.868 --> 47:17.998
You know, Carlton, I just cannot
resist a good practical joke.

47:26.650 --> 47:30.013
- Join me for a drink?
- It'll be my pleasure, sir.
