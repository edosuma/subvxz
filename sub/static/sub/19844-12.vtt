00:00.001 --> 00:02.266
- Previously on The Originals...
- I came to get my journal back.

00:02.268 --> 00:03.976
You made me promise to kill you

00:03.979 --> 00:05.515
if you ever asked for that thing back.

00:05.518 --> 00:07.558
We weren't where we are
now. The Hollow has us.

00:07.561 --> 00:08.929
Vincent thinks he can cure Sofya.

00:08.932 --> 00:11.256
The magic in those
thorns can save someone

00:11.259 --> 00:12.325
that I care about.

00:12.328 --> 00:13.998
I know what he is.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.666
I guess I always knew.

00:15.668 --> 00:18.940
But I loved Elijah despite it,

00:18.943 --> 00:20.628
or maybe because of it.

00:20.631 --> 00:22.330
But I don't want that for Hope.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.065
Hayley asked me to give you the knife.

00:24.068 --> 00:26.333
She's not going to be
here for when Elijah wakes?

00:26.336 --> 00:28.578
I know what I have to do.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.613
I just have to be brave enough to do it.

00:30.615 --> 00:32.682
I want her alive, but barely.

00:32.683 --> 00:36.252
She still has a part to play.

00:36.254 --> 00:40.156
Cencahua ezhuia. Cencahua ezhuia.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.663
She's gone.

00:48.665 --> 00:50.899
She's gone.

01:51.025 --> 01:54.159
I was wondering when you
guys were gonna come for me.

01:54.161 --> 01:57.328
We're here to take back
what belongs to our master.

02:03.536 --> 02:05.157
Well, you're gonna
have to kill me first.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.665
She was hoping you'd say that.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:48.545 --> 02:53.281
We should be celebrating
your return, brother.

02:53.283 --> 02:55.416
Perhaps later.

02:55.418 --> 02:58.453
Hayley's still not talking to you, then.

03:01.057 --> 03:03.190
Give her time, she'll come around.

03:03.192 --> 03:05.792
Will she?

03:05.794 --> 03:07.761
All right, can we please

03:07.763 --> 03:09.973
put a moratorium on all of this sulking?

03:09.976 --> 03:12.333
It's a lovely day, the Hollow is dead

03:12.335 --> 03:14.335
and my brother is back.

03:14.338 --> 03:17.137
Much to the joy of custom
suit tailors everywhere,

03:17.140 --> 03:18.304
not to mention me.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.541
I have to admit, I've
missed the Quarter.

03:22.543 --> 03:24.944
I'm gonna make you take
me out to hear some jazz.

03:24.946 --> 03:26.580
Might I suggest you enjoy the charms

03:26.583 --> 03:28.114
of the city while you still can?

03:28.116 --> 03:31.291
Marcel will want us gone
posthaste, as per our agreement.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.919
Or perhaps he's changed his mind

03:32.921 --> 03:34.452
and he will grant us a reprieve.

03:34.454 --> 03:36.154
He will grant us no such thing.

03:36.156 --> 03:37.622
We're going to meet with him

03:37.624 --> 03:39.424
to discuss the terms of our departure.

03:39.426 --> 03:42.227
I suspect he simply
needs to be asked nicely.

03:43.463 --> 03:47.232
You boys really should
leave these matters to me.

04:00.479 --> 04:03.314
You look good for an all-nighter.

04:03.316 --> 04:06.517
Hey.

04:06.519 --> 04:08.451
What are you doing here?

04:10.622 --> 04:14.357
I... just needed to see you.

04:14.359 --> 04:19.396
Since the whole greeting me
with coffee is completely un-you,

04:19.398 --> 04:22.232
I'm trying to figure out
how worried I should be.

04:24.069 --> 04:26.768
What is it? Are you okay?

04:26.770 --> 04:29.939
We defeated the Hollow yesterday.

04:30.942 --> 04:33.508
Before we killed her,

04:33.510 --> 04:35.311
she got into my head.

04:36.513 --> 04:38.981
Confronted me with a vision.

04:38.983 --> 04:42.383
One meant to capitalize
on my darkest fear.

04:42.385 --> 04:45.619
What did you see?

04:45.621 --> 04:47.221
You.

04:48.959 --> 04:52.293
Lying there, dead.

04:52.295 --> 04:57.298
Your blood on my hands
and I... couldn't save you.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.099
Hey.

04:59.101 --> 05:00.968
You got me.

05:00.970 --> 05:03.536
Exhausted, but still alive.

05:03.538 --> 05:05.472
Right in front of you.

05:05.474 --> 05:09.076
I just kept thinking about all
the things I didn't tell you.

05:09.078 --> 05:13.913
Everything that I feel for you.

05:15.217 --> 05:18.250
What is it you feel
about me, Freya Mikaelson?

06:02.142 --> 06:04.361
Look, I'm a little busy right now.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.663
Then I'll get to the point.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.444
I know that the deal was
for my family to leave town

06:09.447 --> 06:11.367
once our enemy was defeated, but...

06:11.369 --> 06:15.671
there may be opportunities lost

06:15.673 --> 06:18.007
if we stick to those terms.

06:18.009 --> 06:20.143
Opportunities.

06:20.145 --> 06:23.046
What opportunities, exactly?

06:23.048 --> 06:26.048
Food to be savored,

06:26.050 --> 06:28.050
music to be enjoyed.

06:28.052 --> 06:30.485
Broken relationships to be mended.

06:30.487 --> 06:31.986
Ah, look.

06:31.989 --> 06:34.027
Your brothers and I aren't
trying to kill each other.

06:34.029 --> 06:35.885
That's about as mended
as that's gonna get.

06:35.888 --> 06:36.958
If they stick around,

06:36.960 --> 06:38.860
it's only a matter of
time before that changes.

06:38.862 --> 06:40.728
Oh, so dramatic.

06:41.748 --> 06:44.331
You know, not everything
is about power struggles

06:44.333 --> 06:46.967
and French Quarter land grabs.

06:51.107 --> 06:53.174
Look, this'll only complicate
what needs to happen.

06:53.176 --> 06:55.409
All right? You and your
family need to leave.

06:55.411 --> 06:57.044
So last night was what?

06:57.046 --> 06:58.711
One last kiss good-bye?

06:58.713 --> 07:00.113
It was a mistake.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.747
All right, look.

07:01.749 --> 07:02.848
Sofya's in the other room.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.178
Once my witch gets here,

07:04.181 --> 07:05.785
I'll finally have a way to wake her up.

07:05.787 --> 07:07.587
Tell me that you feel nothing for me

07:07.589 --> 07:09.255
and I'll never ask again.

07:09.257 --> 07:11.057
Rebekah.

07:12.394 --> 07:14.394
Go.

07:20.334 --> 07:21.366
Klaus.

07:21.368 --> 07:23.514
I know that look, you need something.

07:23.517 --> 07:24.669
Whatever it is, it can wait.

07:24.671 --> 07:26.171
I'm off to talk to Marcel.

07:26.173 --> 07:28.707
We need to talk about Hope's future.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.041
She's seven.

07:30.043 --> 07:31.977
We're her parents, Hope
will go where we go.

07:31.979 --> 07:33.236
Klaus, we need to have

07:33.239 --> 07:34.677
a very real conversation

07:34.680 --> 07:35.913
about what's best for her.

07:35.915 --> 07:38.583
Yes, there are a couple of conversations

07:38.585 --> 07:40.968
that need to happen, but we're late.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.047
Hey, sweetie, drawing something?

08:12.049 --> 08:13.749
Yes.

08:17.352 --> 08:19.522
What's that supposed to be?

08:19.524 --> 08:21.190
A snowstorm?

08:27.497 --> 08:29.130
So...

08:29.132 --> 08:30.765
now that all this trouble's behind us,

08:30.767 --> 08:32.433
I thought that we could have a chat

08:32.434 --> 08:34.369
about what happens next.

08:34.371 --> 08:36.087
I know that you want
to have a normal life

08:36.091 --> 08:38.221
with friends and school and art

08:38.224 --> 08:41.475
and sports and...

08:41.477 --> 08:42.909
Hey.

08:42.910 --> 08:44.645
You okay?

08:44.647 --> 08:46.313
I'm fine.

08:52.185 --> 08:55.822
Hope, if you're worried
about the Hollow, don't be.

08:55.824 --> 08:59.198
Everything's okay now, I promise.

09:06.870 --> 09:09.802
Can I go back to my drawing?

09:09.804 --> 09:12.141
Sure, yeah.

09:47.373 --> 09:48.638
Hey.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.106
What...

09:50.108 --> 09:52.408
what happened?

09:52.410 --> 09:54.110
Hey.

09:54.112 --> 09:56.178
The Hollow's magic put you in a coma.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.680
I got the right ingredients

09:57.682 --> 10:00.617
and then with the help of a witch...

10:00.619 --> 10:03.085
How are you feeling?

10:03.087 --> 10:04.438
Out of it.

10:12.329 --> 10:16.831
When the Hollow grabbed
me, it was like...

10:16.833 --> 10:21.403
I was shoved down into
some dark corner of myself.

10:21.405 --> 10:24.872
I never felt so lost.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.742
Like I was slipping away.

10:27.744 --> 10:29.277
And in that moment,

10:29.279 --> 10:32.713
after she left, it was just darkness.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.749
I wasn't sure I'd make my way back.

10:34.751 --> 10:36.950
Yeah, but you did. You made it back.

10:36.952 --> 10:38.519
Thanks to you.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.832
I don't think she's gone.

10:52.834 --> 10:57.102
No, no, no. Hayley
killed her last night.

10:57.104 --> 10:59.471
Marcel...

10:59.473 --> 11:01.407
Marcel, I can feel her.

11:01.409 --> 11:04.176
The Hollow's still out there somewhere.

11:06.947 --> 11:08.697
I know she is.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.371
Impossible.

11:16.374 --> 11:18.445
Whatever those thieving
acolytes are up to,

11:18.447 --> 11:20.513
they function
independently of the Hollow.

11:20.515 --> 11:22.750
Hayley killed her, I saw the
corpse through my own eyes.

11:22.752 --> 11:25.452
Her body is dead,
Klaus. That's not enough.

11:26.409 --> 11:27.507
What are you saying?

11:27.510 --> 11:28.588
I'm saying that by now,

11:28.591 --> 11:30.923
the Ancestors should've been
able to imprison her spirit.

11:30.925 --> 11:32.024
That didn't happen.

11:32.026 --> 11:34.227
The spirit's still out there.

11:34.229 --> 11:35.762
So she must've had a plan B.

11:35.764 --> 11:38.530
No doubt. Perhaps they had assistance.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.966
Tell me...

11:39.968 --> 11:41.934
- were you a part of it?
- Oh, come on, man.

11:41.936 --> 11:44.669
Hey, back off. All right,
look, I trust Vincent.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.204
Look, I don't care if...
I don't care if any of you

11:46.206 --> 11:47.538
trust me, to be perfectly honest.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.907
Because unlike all of you,

11:48.909 --> 11:50.341
I have been doing something.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.144
I've been spending
the past couple of days

11:52.146 --> 11:54.246
trying to figure out a way to
lock the Hollow up for good.

11:54.248 --> 11:56.281
And do you have any answers?

11:56.283 --> 11:57.949
Yes.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.285
And no.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.620
I used the book to put
myself into a trance.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.556
Which book are you talking about?

12:06.558 --> 12:07.771
The book he found.

12:07.774 --> 12:09.459
Contains the secrets
of the Hollow's magic.

12:09.461 --> 12:10.661
Written...

12:10.663 --> 12:12.596
- in his handwriting.
- Ah.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.431
Well, you can see how no part of this

12:14.433 --> 12:16.279
filled me with a modicum of confidence.

12:16.282 --> 12:18.067
And while I was in that
trance, I met with the spirit

12:18.069 --> 12:19.269
of Inadu's mother.

12:19.271 --> 12:21.271
From her, I was trying to get

12:21.273 --> 12:23.142
the same spell that
she used 1,500 years ago

12:23.145 --> 12:24.407
to put her daughter down.

12:24.409 --> 12:26.709
Now, that's when those acolytes
showed up and stopped me.

12:26.711 --> 12:28.711
Well, what are you waiting
for? Get back to work!

12:28.713 --> 12:30.340
The acolytes took the book.

12:30.343 --> 12:33.216
I have a library full of
grimoires. Take your pick!

12:33.218 --> 12:35.918
Klaus, I don't need your
library. That book is special.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.119
That book represents an extension

12:37.121 --> 12:38.120
of the Hollow's power

12:38.122 --> 12:39.321
into this world, all right?

12:39.323 --> 12:41.489
It is just as eternal as she is.

12:41.491 --> 12:43.625
And I'm telling you right
now, if I tweak that spell

12:43.627 --> 12:45.250
in just the right way, I
can lock her in the book

12:45.252 --> 12:46.795
and put the Hollow down for good.

12:46.797 --> 12:48.263
So where is it now?

12:49.747 --> 12:51.814
It's still with the acolytes.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.137
I used this page from the book

12:56.139 --> 12:58.806
to track them to the
place where she was reborn.

13:00.009 --> 13:02.476
That's where you'll find them.

13:02.478 --> 13:04.611
Niklaus.

13:07.183 --> 13:08.682
Wait, I'm going with you.

13:08.684 --> 13:09.816
Marcel...

13:11.220 --> 13:13.486
we got something that
we need to deal with.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.797
Let me guess,

13:24.799 --> 13:26.631
Elijah?

13:28.635 --> 13:32.271
Things between us are complicated.

13:32.273 --> 13:35.841
Well, that's a word often
used to describe my brother.

13:35.843 --> 13:37.943
But his feelings for
you are quite simple.

13:37.945 --> 13:39.879
He adores you, Hayley.

13:39.881 --> 13:42.248
I know that.

13:42.250 --> 13:46.251
And I know the sacrifices he's
made for me, for this family.

13:46.253 --> 13:49.520
He's saved us all at various times.

13:50.357 --> 13:53.358
I saw things, Rebekah,

13:53.360 --> 13:55.226
in his mind.

13:57.063 --> 13:58.997
Not just memories. I saw...

13:58.999 --> 14:02.465
his impulse, his
natural instincts, and...

14:02.467 --> 14:07.404
I think maybe that's who
he really is at his core.

14:07.406 --> 14:09.839
And that scared you?

14:11.143 --> 14:14.444
You're afraid that Hope
will see that side of him?

14:17.436 --> 14:19.592
I worry that she'll see that I'm...

14:19.595 --> 14:21.155
okay with it.

14:22.954 --> 14:25.354
What am I teaching her if I allow her

14:25.356 --> 14:28.024
to grow up in a place where we...

14:28.026 --> 14:29.892
trap our enemies in dungeons

14:29.894 --> 14:32.861
and retaliate against threats
by killing whole neighborhoods?

14:32.863 --> 14:34.662
I...

14:34.664 --> 14:37.973
I don't want her
learning to become that.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.890
_

14:57.262 --> 15:01.264
So now the only way for
us to trap the Hollow

15:01.267 --> 15:03.801
is to get that spell
from Inadu's mother.

15:03.804 --> 15:06.560
You want to find a way to
see her without the book.

15:06.562 --> 15:09.429
Right. But the problem
is I'm not strong enough

15:09.431 --> 15:12.565
to do it on my own, so I'm
gonna need to channel your power.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.000
No.

15:17.738 --> 15:19.705
Marcel, you know me.

15:19.707 --> 15:22.108
We've been running this
city together for five years.

15:22.118 --> 15:24.627
Yeah, I know. And you
also told me to kill you

15:24.630 --> 15:26.463
if you ever asked for that book back.

15:26.466 --> 15:29.247
That's because I didn't
know that I could handle it.

15:29.249 --> 15:30.915
But look at me, man.

15:31.952 --> 15:33.785
Do I look like one of these acolytes?

15:35.089 --> 15:37.356
Do I look like Kinney?

15:41.628 --> 15:43.827
No.

15:45.898 --> 15:48.165
What do you need me to do?

15:48.167 --> 15:49.967
Give me your hand.

16:21.132 --> 16:23.443
I couldn't get to her.

16:23.446 --> 16:25.167
The living aren't meant to be there.

16:25.169 --> 16:26.668
Okay, well, come on, let's try again.

16:26.670 --> 16:28.937
No. There's no point.

16:28.939 --> 16:31.373
Even with your power, it's not enough.

16:31.375 --> 16:32.874
The book was the only
thing powerful enough

16:32.876 --> 16:34.208
to let me reach her.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.341
Okay, so where does that leave us now?

16:36.344 --> 16:37.609
Leaves us with one option.

16:37.612 --> 16:40.148
I'm gonna have to be dead.

16:50.825 --> 16:53.826
What are you doing?

16:57.632 --> 17:01.334
I can't be strong for my mommy
and daddy if I can't do magic.

17:01.336 --> 17:03.503
Hope, you don't have to protect them.

17:03.505 --> 17:05.637
We're all here to protect you.
Now, let's get your bracelet...

17:05.640 --> 17:06.705
No.

17:08.576 --> 17:10.476
Sweetheart, in a thousand years,

17:10.478 --> 17:12.743
our family has never been bested.

17:13.814 --> 17:15.948
There's nothing that can defeat us.

17:17.851 --> 17:20.586
Well, there is one thing.

17:42.130 --> 17:45.330
You coming to see me this morning,

17:45.332 --> 17:48.299
it was nice.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.435
Well, the truth is, uh...

17:51.437 --> 17:54.572
I almost ran.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.008
Pretty good at that, actually.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.577
Why didn't you?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.981
Well...

18:03.983 --> 18:08.085
it just hit me

18:08.087 --> 18:11.688
that... when I die,

18:11.690 --> 18:16.160
I'm not going to wake
up five minutes later.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.295
Neither are you.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.430
Compared to the rest of my family,

18:21.432 --> 18:24.600
my life is going to be so short.

18:24.602 --> 18:26.435
And...

18:26.437 --> 18:29.371
I guess I just didn't want
to waste it running anymore.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.178
I'm glad you didn't.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.317
Okay.

18:53.662 --> 18:56.095
Perhaps you should wait here.

18:56.097 --> 18:58.230
We're heading to the
place where you died.

18:58.232 --> 19:00.132
I wouldn't blame you.

19:00.134 --> 19:04.170
If I thought I couldn't do
this, I wouldn't have come.

19:04.172 --> 19:07.706
Niklaus, when this is done,

19:07.708 --> 19:10.078
I want you to take Hayley
and Hope away from this.

19:10.081 --> 19:11.542
All of it.

19:11.544 --> 19:15.847
You've pointedly left
yourself out of that equation.

19:17.851 --> 19:19.550
Whatever Hayley saw in you,

19:19.552 --> 19:20.952
she will come to accept.

19:20.954 --> 19:22.620
No, she won't.

19:26.078 --> 19:29.326
I can't explain to her
what she saw, Niklaus.

19:29.328 --> 19:31.061
Who I am...

19:31.063 --> 19:33.730
- You're tired.
- And what are we, Niklaus?

19:33.732 --> 19:36.333
A thousand years of emptiness,

19:36.335 --> 19:39.503
an endless parade of slaughter.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.807
Until your daughter came to us.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.609
Now she is everything, Niklaus,

19:46.611 --> 19:48.311
worth every fight,

19:48.313 --> 19:49.745
worth every sacrifice.

19:49.747 --> 19:52.148
She must not suffer the same fate...

19:52.150 --> 19:54.417
Wiping the Hollow from
the face of this earth

19:54.419 --> 19:56.685
will ensure her safety.

19:58.189 --> 20:01.057
Everything else can wait.

20:05.996 --> 20:09.664
So, I know we're not always
the most open around here,

20:09.666 --> 20:12.334
but I have to tell someone...

20:13.370 --> 20:15.303
What's wrong?

20:15.305 --> 20:17.072
Freya, I've been thinking all morning

20:17.074 --> 20:19.340
about what happened last night.

20:19.342 --> 20:20.574
The Hollow had me.

20:20.577 --> 20:22.831
She could've killed me, but she didn't.

20:22.834 --> 20:26.180
She just took my blood and left. Why?

20:27.216 --> 20:29.716
Well, blood can be used
for a number of reasons.

20:29.718 --> 20:33.087
Locator spells, healing
spells, linking s...

20:33.089 --> 20:34.188
Linking spell.

20:35.158 --> 20:37.257
She didn't link herself to me.

20:41.096 --> 20:43.596
I took this from Hope's room.

20:43.598 --> 20:45.432
Do a reading on this.

20:45.434 --> 20:47.600
Tell me what kind of energy you feel.

21:01.082 --> 21:02.381
It's the Hollow's magic.

21:02.383 --> 21:04.149
Labonair blood was supposed to kill her.

21:04.151 --> 21:06.618
Unless she tapped into
your bloodline deliberately,

21:06.620 --> 21:08.353
found a way to overcome the power

21:08.355 --> 21:10.021
and turned it into a strength.

21:10.023 --> 21:12.457
She knows that I wouldn't
hurt my own daughter.

21:13.393 --> 21:14.992
What do we do?

21:21.699 --> 21:23.301
This is a neurotoxin.

21:23.303 --> 21:25.113
Now, it's enough to stop my heart,

21:25.116 --> 21:26.681
and it's gonna give me plenty of time

21:26.684 --> 21:28.572
to finish up my business
with Inadu's mother.

21:28.574 --> 21:31.174
Okay, so how the hell
do I bring you back?

21:35.981 --> 21:37.614
Huh.

21:38.450 --> 21:40.683
Jam it right into my heart.

21:40.685 --> 21:42.819
That should start things up again,

21:42.821 --> 21:45.621
but you got to do it before the last
grain of sand falls in this thing.

21:45.623 --> 21:47.356
If you don't, I die,

21:47.358 --> 21:50.426
and your only chance of
getting rid of that monster

21:50.428 --> 21:51.994
goes with me.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.446
See you soon.

23:04.864 --> 23:08.466
Pouvwa Domini nostri.

23:08.468 --> 23:12.102
Pouvwa Domini nostri.

23:12.104 --> 23:15.939
Pouvwa Domini nostri.

23:15.941 --> 23:18.676
Sorry to break up your
little prayer circle.

23:19.645 --> 23:22.045
We've come for that book.

23:22.047 --> 23:24.248
And to kill the lot of you.

23:35.993 --> 23:38.961
Even if you succeed
in taking the book...

23:40.164 --> 23:41.997
you will stop nothing.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.765
The spell has already begun.

23:43.767 --> 23:47.102
Well, that is unfortunate.

23:47.605 --> 23:48.903
Wait!

23:50.774 --> 23:54.710
You've no idea the gravity
of your situation, do you?

23:54.712 --> 23:56.945
Well, by all means,
spend the last few moments

23:56.947 --> 23:58.813
of your life illuminating things for us.

23:58.815 --> 24:02.583
The Hollow has shed her flesh
to take on that of another.

24:02.585 --> 24:04.051
Yes, yes, yes,

24:04.053 --> 24:06.019
and we'll kill that body
as well, and on and on

24:06.021 --> 24:07.355
until she gets the hint.

24:07.357 --> 24:09.923
Oh, you won't dare kill
the body she's taken.

24:11.394 --> 24:12.993
Even now she's locking herself

24:12.995 --> 24:15.529
within the greatest witch
this world may ever know.

24:15.531 --> 24:18.298
And in a lovely touch of irony,

24:18.300 --> 24:21.901
it's someone you would rather
die than allow to be harmed.

24:27.778 --> 24:30.342
Apne za mene.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.246
Apne za mene.

24:33.249 --> 24:36.017
Apne za mene.

24:36.020 --> 24:39.267
Apne za mene.

24:40.796 --> 24:42.362
There.

24:43.665 --> 24:45.498
You'll be safe in here.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.100
Only I can enter.

24:47.102 --> 24:49.528
Mm-mm. I'm not staying in here, Freya.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.036
The Hollow's tried to kill you, like,

24:51.039 --> 24:52.787
- a hundred times.
- She knows you're my weakness.

24:52.789 --> 24:54.355
If you're fighting, I'm fighting.

24:55.340 --> 24:57.040
End of discussion.

25:05.052 --> 25:07.253
Hey, just please...

25:07.255 --> 25:09.421
don't try to stop me.

25:11.692 --> 25:13.759
I already have.

25:18.098 --> 25:20.765
Freya...

25:49.295 --> 25:52.295
Hey... sweetie.

25:54.899 --> 25:57.900
Why don't you... take
that chess set downstairs

25:57.902 --> 26:00.469
and we can play together.

26:02.039 --> 26:06.007
You want to find a spot
and I'll fix us a snack?

26:15.518 --> 26:17.692
I want my daughter back.

26:35.604 --> 26:38.138
Let me guess... you're here
on behalf of the Hollow.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.974
All right, then listen up.

26:39.976 --> 26:43.209
The only way you're gonna get
to Vincent is over my dead body,

26:43.211 --> 26:46.346
and in case you haven't
heard, I can't die.

26:51.352 --> 26:53.518
I tried, right?

26:53.521 --> 26:56.356
I don't care how long it
takes or what I have to do,

26:56.358 --> 26:58.323
I will get my daughter back.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.164
You won't.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.700
Hope is still fighting,
but she'll give in soon.

27:08.702 --> 27:10.432
Once this is complete,

27:10.435 --> 27:13.405
I'll be in her body permanently.

27:21.780 --> 27:23.047
You won't hurt me.

27:23.049 --> 27:24.915
I'm your daughter.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.683
- You can't.
- Inadu.

27:39.331 --> 27:42.032
How long do we have?

27:42.034 --> 27:45.568
She's not going to be happy when
she breaks through that sleep spell.

27:45.570 --> 27:47.937
Which means we need to work fast.

28:05.956 --> 28:07.721
No!

28:19.536 --> 28:23.670
Arracher soti je. Arracher soti je.

28:30.845 --> 28:32.479
Arracher soti je.

28:37.119 --> 28:39.052
Thank me later.

28:49.763 --> 28:50.982
Come on, come on,

28:50.985 --> 28:53.532
come on, come on, come on. Come on.

28:54.935 --> 28:56.602
Come on, come on, come on...

28:58.805 --> 29:00.271
Welcome back.

29:01.441 --> 29:03.174
Did you get what you needed?

29:03.176 --> 29:05.577
Yeah, I did.

29:05.579 --> 29:08.793
And I got some very bad
news to go along with it.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.851
Hope's still out. You
think this'll work?

29:13.853 --> 29:16.189
The pendant was built to hold
a person of Mikaelson blood.

29:16.192 --> 29:17.424
So it will hold Hope.

29:17.427 --> 29:19.494
I did my best to repair it.

29:20.246 --> 29:22.646
Valiant effort...

29:22.649 --> 29:24.528
but Hope belongs to me.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.667
Over my dead body.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.305
So be it.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.643
Okay, watch your step.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.412
You kill all these people?

29:41.414 --> 29:42.846
Yeah.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.248
Sofya.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.484
They were loyal to the Hollow.

29:46.486 --> 29:48.118
They got what they deserved.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.253
My sentiments exactly.

29:50.255 --> 29:52.551
That monstrosity has its
claws into my daughter.

29:52.554 --> 29:55.058
I said I'd get you this book
in exchange for your help.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.493
You're up.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.961
There's something you need to know.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.663
It's about the Hollow.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.499
That thing took control of my body,

30:02.501 --> 30:05.334
just as it's done to your daughter.

30:05.336 --> 30:08.337
While she had me, all I wanted to do

30:08.339 --> 30:12.241
was give up, just drift into darkness

30:12.243 --> 30:13.875
and be gone forever.

30:13.877 --> 30:17.079
But I knew if I did she would
have taken me over for good.

30:17.081 --> 30:19.081
You can't let that happen to Hope.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.583
She may be strong, but
she's still a child.

30:22.585 --> 30:24.618
You have to reach her,

30:24.620 --> 30:26.855
or all of this is for nothing.

30:31.327 --> 30:33.928
This thing is filled the Hollow's magic.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.496
Hope's connected to that.

30:35.498 --> 30:37.580
She's connected to
you through your blood.

30:37.583 --> 30:39.732
If I can bring all those
things together, then I should

30:39.734 --> 30:42.001
be able to craft a spell
that can get you to her.

30:42.003 --> 30:44.438
Then you just have to keep Hope with us.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.203
Let's do it.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.613
Hope will fight you.

30:53.615 --> 30:55.648
I can feel her love for you.

30:56.717 --> 31:00.286
It's a shame it's not enough.

31:01.922 --> 31:03.689
Oh!

31:26.847 --> 31:29.046
Hope?

31:34.554 --> 31:36.253
I'm here.

31:40.015 --> 31:41.747
The Hollow came.

31:41.749 --> 31:44.183
I tried to fight her.

31:44.185 --> 31:46.419
But everything is so dark.

31:46.421 --> 31:48.269
It's so cold and...

31:48.272 --> 31:50.472
I'm so tired.

31:58.953 --> 32:00.920
All right, she's here.

32:00.922 --> 32:03.189
You guys know what to do.

32:18.271 --> 32:20.104
Hello again.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.053
Hope.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.322
Hope, listen to me.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.592
You need to stay awake. Okay?

32:42.594 --> 32:44.961
You have to stay with me.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.495
Can you do that?

32:48.266 --> 32:50.466
I'll try.

32:57.313 --> 32:58.908
How predictable.

32:59.643 --> 33:01.542
You will pay for this.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.880
I've killed you once, Elijah.

33:04.882 --> 33:07.983
I won't hesitate to do so again.

33:10.087 --> 33:12.487
Inadu.

33:12.489 --> 33:14.990
Show yourself.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.391
What's the matter...

33:16.393 --> 33:19.626
The big, bad Hollow
too scared to face me?

33:19.628 --> 33:21.528
I hide from no one.

33:23.232 --> 33:24.664
Especially not

33:24.666 --> 33:27.734
some would-be king of New Orleans.

33:37.012 --> 33:39.445
That is vicious.

33:40.949 --> 33:43.116
Even for you.

33:45.220 --> 33:47.453
He must have struck a nerve.

33:47.455 --> 33:49.188
I'm sure he had a hell
of a lot more to say,

33:49.190 --> 33:50.790
but it doesn't even matter, because

33:50.792 --> 33:53.458
he kept you occupied long enough

33:53.460 --> 33:54.893
for me to trap you.

33:54.895 --> 33:57.762
You really think you can defeat me?

33:58.546 --> 34:00.332
You're welcome to try.

34:00.334 --> 34:03.201
But once Hope Mikaelson gives in...

34:03.203 --> 34:06.671
I will be more powerful
than you can even imagine.

34:06.673 --> 34:08.472
That's not gonna happen.

34:08.474 --> 34:12.208
See, I've been communing
with the Ancestors.

34:15.681 --> 34:17.781
Your mama among 'em.

34:17.783 --> 34:21.385
She gave me the spell she
used to kill you, and now

34:21.387 --> 34:23.420
I'm gonna put you in your cage.

34:23.422 --> 34:25.422
Forever.

34:28.193 --> 34:32.094
Arréter majik sa a.

34:32.097 --> 34:34.397
Arréter majik sa a.

34:34.399 --> 34:36.632
Arréter majik sa a.

34:36.634 --> 34:39.135
Arréter majik sa a.

34:39.137 --> 34:41.737
Hope, open your eyes.

34:41.739 --> 34:44.072
You can't fall asleep.

34:46.877 --> 34:49.078
I'm gonna tell you a story.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.847
And you have to stay
awake to hear it, okay?

34:53.384 --> 34:56.284
Before you were born,

34:56.286 --> 34:59.087
I was a very different creature.

34:59.089 --> 35:01.789
I was cruel.

35:01.791 --> 35:04.025
I was mean.

35:04.027 --> 35:05.626
And I would revel in the terror

35:05.628 --> 35:07.862
which I inspired in others.

35:07.864 --> 35:10.131
But, Hope,

35:10.133 --> 35:13.501
from the moment I saw you,

35:13.503 --> 35:16.003
I wanted nothing more than to be worthy

35:16.005 --> 35:18.005
of being your father.

35:20.079 --> 35:22.976
Arréter majik sa a.

35:22.978 --> 35:24.344
Arréter majik sa a!

35:24.346 --> 35:26.252
No!

35:26.255 --> 35:28.982
That anger that you're feeling
right now, that's called losing.

35:28.984 --> 35:30.917
Because after this you're
never ever gonna be able

35:30.919 --> 35:32.352
to lock yourself inside
of Hope Mikaelson.

35:32.354 --> 35:34.220
And once I put you inside of this book,

35:34.222 --> 35:36.288
you're never gonna be
able to get out again, so

35:36.290 --> 35:38.690
arréter majik sa a.

35:38.692 --> 35:41.660
Arréter majik sa a!

35:41.662 --> 35:44.830
But I'm afraid, Hope.

35:44.832 --> 35:47.266
I'm afraid, without you,

35:47.268 --> 35:49.835
I'll return to the darkness.

35:49.837 --> 35:52.703
So I need you.

35:52.705 --> 35:55.507
I need you to fight.

35:56.543 --> 35:59.377
I will, Daddy.

35:59.379 --> 36:01.946
Arréter majik sa a.

36:01.948 --> 36:04.749
Arréter majik sa a!

36:04.751 --> 36:07.084
- Arréter majik sa a.
- You think you've beaten me?

36:07.086 --> 36:08.352
Arréter majik sa a.

36:08.354 --> 36:09.953
Arréter majik sa a.

36:09.955 --> 36:12.089
Arréter majik sa a.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.036
Where is she?

37:36.038 --> 37:37.204
I couldn't save her.

37:37.206 --> 37:38.272
Hope's gone.

37:38.274 --> 37:40.073
What?

37:40.075 --> 37:42.275
- She's the Hollow now.
- We have to find her.

37:42.277 --> 37:44.543
Vincent, surely you can
pull the Hollow out of...

37:44.545 --> 37:46.645
Elijah, if it were easy enough
for me to just pull her out,

37:46.647 --> 37:48.680
then I would not be standing
here talking to you right now.

37:48.682 --> 37:49.949
I don't have a place to put her.

37:49.951 --> 37:51.550
The book is destroyed, all right?

37:51.552 --> 37:53.452
The book is the only thing
that's powerful enough

37:53.454 --> 37:54.853
to house her eternal spirit.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.555
Well, there must be some other way.

37:59.359 --> 38:00.625
Vincent?

38:00.627 --> 38:02.727
I don't know any other way.

38:09.101 --> 38:10.601
- Where you going?
- To find my daughter.

38:10.603 --> 38:11.869
How are you going to do that?

38:11.871 --> 38:13.271
- We'll figure it out.
- Let me help you.

38:13.273 --> 38:14.605
Don't touch me.

38:16.809 --> 38:20.710
I am on your side.

38:21.914 --> 38:24.781
I should never have
brought her back here.

39:39.888 --> 39:44.056
A thousand years ago, we
three made an eternal vow.

39:44.058 --> 39:46.258
To protect each other,

39:46.260 --> 39:49.761
always and forever.

39:49.763 --> 39:52.764
Freya, that vow now includes you.

39:56.237 --> 39:58.802
As it includes my daughter.

40:00.673 --> 40:02.940
She is my heart and soul.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.178
Right now she's out there,

40:07.180 --> 40:10.281
alone in the darkness,

40:10.283 --> 40:12.483
fighting.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.657
We can't give up.

40:20.659 --> 40:22.692
So I'm begging you...

40:22.694 --> 40:26.629
All of you...

40:26.632 --> 40:29.097
If there's any chance...

40:29.100 --> 40:30.833
I think I know a way to save her.

40:32.670 --> 40:34.236
Anything.

40:35.773 --> 40:39.341
If we go this route, this is
gonna be the end of your family.

40:42.246 --> 40:45.539
This is gonna be the end
of always and forever.
