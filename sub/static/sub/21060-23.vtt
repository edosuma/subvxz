00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent

00:39.133 --> 00:40.767
in a court of law.

00:43.233 --> 00:45.000

01:00.733 --> 01:03.500

01:05.267 --> 01:08.400
A guy just walkin' in the road
up here almost got hit
by a car.

01:08.433 --> 01:10.700
We're gonna stop him
and make sure everything's okay.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.200

01:35.300 --> 01:37.067

01:37.100 --> 01:41.067
(breathing heavily)
Wh-- What's your name?

01:41.100 --> 01:42.700
-Daniel.
-Daniel?

01:42.733 --> 01:44.267
Drop this.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.867
Get on your stomach.

01:47.633 --> 01:49.667
Give me your other...

01:51.133 --> 01:52.967
How come you ran from me?

01:53.067 --> 01:54.933
-I don't know,
I didn't know what's goin' on.

01:54.967 --> 01:56.400
-You don't know?

01:56.433 --> 01:58.700
-No.
-I stopped you 'cause
you're walkin' in the middle

01:58.733 --> 02:02.167
of the street.
That's obstructin'
a public thoroughfare.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.333
Why'd you run?

02:03.367 --> 02:05.267
-I-- I literally
have no reason.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.867
-I'm gonna sit you up, man.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.367
Where's your ID?

02:15.400 --> 02:18.200
-Um, it's in my back pocket.
-In your back pocket?

02:18.233 --> 02:19.300
-Yeah.
-Right here?

02:19.333 --> 02:20.400
-Yeah.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.233
-So be honest with me,
dude, why'd you run?

02:24.267 --> 02:27.233
-I-- I don't know, I--
-You got a warrant?

02:27.267 --> 02:30.533
-Not that I know of.
-Then why'd you run?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.267
-It just makes me nervous.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.067
-Just makes you nervous?
All right.

02:34.067 --> 02:36.433
Well, here's the deal, bud.
You're walkin' in the middle
of the street...

02:36.467 --> 02:38.167
-Right.
-...obstructing
a public thoroughfare, okay?

02:38.200 --> 02:42.433
That's-- That's a misdemeanor.
Okay? Then you just run
from me, right?

02:42.467 --> 02:43.900
That looks weird, right?

02:43.933 --> 02:46.467
-Yeah. (laughs)
-You don't have
any warrants, okay?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.700
But you're under arrest
for obstructing a public
thoroughfare, okay?

02:49.733 --> 02:51.367
-Come on. Please?
-You got anything
in your pockets

02:51.400 --> 02:52.633
you shouldn't have?

02:52.667 --> 02:54.467
-I have a rig.
-A rig?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.233
-I'll be-- be honest with you.
-Is that why you ran?

02:56.267 --> 02:57.900
-Yes.
-Yes. Okay.

02:57.933 --> 02:59.900
What pocket is that in?

03:00.067 --> 03:02.067
-That's...

03:02.067 --> 03:04.200
Oh, right here.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.800
-Can you feel anything?

03:05.833 --> 03:06.933
-Yeah, there's
a syringe in there.

03:06.967 --> 03:08.167
-Oh, there it is.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.500
All right, we're gonna
take this jacket off.

03:10.533 --> 03:14.267
Pull your arm out.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.767
Can you pull that sleeve off
with that handcuff
still on there?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.633
-Probably.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.533
-Anything else in here?

03:21.567 --> 03:24.100
What's in here, man?

03:24.133 --> 03:25.567
Parfait.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.067
-Man, don't even get to eat
my parfait.
-Oh, man.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.067
-Hm-hm-hm.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.900
-Huh?
-Indian head penny.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.233
-Here we go.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.933
(indistinct)
-I didn't know it was there.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.733
-That's heroin right there.
-Got some more, some heroin
right there.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.533
-Daniel: Wow, that's retarded.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.533
-What else is in here, man?

03:50.567 --> 03:51.800
-Another little bag.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.833
-Some more stuff.
-More heroin.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.067
-What do you got there, Jones?

03:57.067 --> 03:58.900
-Looks like you got
a little more heroin in here.

03:58.933 --> 04:01.067
It's, uh-- It's got a cut
here in the pocket,

04:01.067 --> 04:03.067
feeds into the back
of the jacket here.

04:03.067 --> 04:07.067
So we've already pulled out
three different baggies full
of, uh, drugs here.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.733
-Sincerely, I had no idea
that (bleep) was in there,

04:09.767 --> 04:12.467
and I would've told you
if it was, like, be honest,

04:12.500 --> 04:14.133
I was bein' honest
with the paraphernalia.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.600
I'd have been honest
with that (bleep), too.

04:15.633 --> 04:16.833
-Okay.
-I had no idea, like--

04:16.867 --> 04:18.833
-Who's jacket is it?
-It's my jacket.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.267
-It's your jacket.
-I'm bein' honest.
I'm a hundred percent honest,

04:21.300 --> 04:22.833
like--
-So you don't know--

04:22.867 --> 04:24.167
-I'm not a bad person.
-Right, but I--

04:24.200 --> 04:25.833
I never said
you're a bad person,
but you don't know

04:25.867 --> 04:27.233
what's in the pockets
of your jacket?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.067
-No. No, I didn't.
Honestly. Honest to god.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.867
-Okay. Okay.
-I knew that parapherna--
that rig was in there,

04:31.900 --> 04:33.367
-Okay.
-And I told you about it.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.633
-Right. Right, but--
-And I was honest
with the paraphernalia, man.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.867
-Just 'cause you don't know
it's in there, though,
it's your jacket,

04:37.900 --> 04:39.867
and you're in possession
of it, right?

04:39.900 --> 04:41.800
-Can-- uh--
-Right? Yes or no?

04:41.833 --> 04:43.300
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.333
-Can--
-So you're under arrest
for possession of narcotics.

04:45.367 --> 04:48.467
-Man, please.
-Okay, is it--
what is that black stuff?

04:48.500 --> 04:49.533
-Heroin.
-It's heroin.

04:49.567 --> 04:50.800
-I'm bein' honest with you.
-Right.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.267
So when's
the last time you used?
-Earlier today.

04:53.300 --> 04:57.167
-Earlier today?
All right, well,
like I said, man,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.067
you're under arrest
for possession of heroin.
-Please.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.600
-Possession of narcotics, okay?
-Please.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.500
Man, you had no warrants,
either. Like, what the hell?

05:04.533 --> 05:06.367
This is so dumb.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.500
-One last time,
you got anything else, man?

05:09.533 --> 05:11.067
-No, not that I know of.
-Okay.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.167
How long you been using?
-A good 10 years.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.400
-10 years?
-And I'm tryin' to get clean,
like, I'm-- that's why

05:16.433 --> 05:18.733
I wanna go see (indistinct).
I've been trying
to go down there

05:18.767 --> 05:20.733
the last few days.
I have no transportation
whatsoever.

05:20.767 --> 05:23.700
-Right.
-And I respect you
that you told me that that stuff

05:23.733 --> 05:25.400
was in there.
-...couple years for the BS
right now.

05:25.433 --> 05:28.400
-You what?
-I could do a couple years
for this BS right now.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.600
I didn't even have
no warrants, sir.

05:31.633 --> 05:33.500
Please, I'm tryin'
to get help, man.

05:33.533 --> 05:37.233
-Right.
Okay, so if that happens,
and you-- you go to jail,

05:37.267 --> 05:39.400
they can get you some treatment
in there, man.

05:39.433 --> 05:43.067
Okay?
That's an opportunity for you
to-- that you know

05:43.067 --> 05:45.667
you'll be off the street.
You can turn stuff
around, right?

05:45.700 --> 05:48.167
-Yeah, but I-- if I get
a couple years in prison,

05:48.200 --> 05:52.300
like, look how small I am,
man, I-- that's not-- I can't
do that.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.867
Y-- You'll be all right, man.
-No, I won't, bro.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.333
-Okay.
So right now, we're
gonna put you

05:58.367 --> 05:59.667
in this
other officer's car, okay?

05:59.700 --> 06:01.833
We're gonna transfer you
over, all right?

06:01.867 --> 06:04.200
And he's gonna
take you down, okay?

06:04.233 --> 06:06.967
-I'm not gettin' out.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.500
I'm an addict,
and I admit I'm an addict,
I need help.

06:12.533 --> 06:13.700
-Right.
-I need treatment.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.800
-We have certain ways
of helping people like you,

06:15.833 --> 06:17.133
and this is one of those ways.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.433
-I just wish you guys
could help me out
a little bit more.

06:19.467 --> 06:21.300
-Right.
-Like, not getting me
with the felony.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.567
Maybe
a misdemeanor, but...

06:23.600 --> 06:27.800
Come on, man.
-I have to do what the--
what the law says, okay?

06:27.833 --> 06:30.500
I'm gonna throw this belt
on you real quick,
all right, man?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.867
-Please, sir...

06:39.933 --> 06:44.233
-And maybe next time
you'll remember what's
in your pockets, all right?

06:44.267 --> 06:45.900
Sounds like he's tryin'
to get clean, you know,

06:45.933 --> 06:48.200
and-- and that's the way
he wants to go,
which is good.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.767
Hopefully, little-- little bit
of time off the streets'll
get him clean for a little bit,

06:51.800 --> 06:54.067
and they can hook him up
with some resources, so...

06:54.067 --> 06:55.867
-Sure, yeah.
That's the best way
to do it.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.800
He's 27 years old,
he's got a full life
ahead of him, so...

06:57.833 --> 06:58.933
-Yeah.
-Good job, buddy.

06:58.967 --> 07:00.633
-Right.
-Way to be out there, man.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.667
-Burnside: I've been workin'
at Fontana Police Department
for about 12 years now.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.200
Really have had
a blessed career here.

07:07.233 --> 07:10.800
I did a couple years'
patrol, worked as a school
resource officer,

07:10.833 --> 07:12.267
and in the gang unit.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.833
I'm back out here on patrol
where I like it,

07:13.867 --> 07:16.867
and Fontana's really
a growing city.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.067
It really is a hidden gem
out here.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.433
All the different things
the city offers, the programs,

07:21.467 --> 07:25.267
and the citizens seem
to really enjoy livin' out here.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.067
-(radio chatter)

07:27.067 --> 07:29.967
-Uh, we're behind a car
right now, the subject
possibly armed with a handgun,

07:30.067 --> 07:34.167
uh, that was givin' some threats
to some other subjects
in the city.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.367
So we're gonna attempt
a traffic stop on it now.

07:38.233 --> 07:41.667
Subject's yielded just west
of Riverside.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.500
-Dispatcher: Vehicle's
west of Riverside.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.100
(radio chatter)

07:50.133 --> 07:53.600
-Driver.
Driver, put the keys
out the window.

07:57.767 --> 08:01.133
Put both hands
out the window.

08:01.167 --> 08:04.500
With your left hand,
open the door and step out.

08:04.533 --> 08:07.567
-(siren sounding)

08:09.700 --> 08:11.967
-Turn around,
face away from us.

08:12.067 --> 08:15.067
Keep your hands up,
start walkin' backwards.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.733
Walk, walk, walk.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.800
Keep walkin'.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.800
Walk back to me, bud,
walk back.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.067
Keep walkin'.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.733
Face forward,
face forward.

08:24.767 --> 08:27.133
-Hey, bro, what's goin' on?
-Down to your knees,
right now.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.900
-What'd I do?
-Down to your knees.

08:28.933 --> 08:31.800
-What did I do, bro?
-Relax. I'll explain it to you.

08:31.833 --> 08:33.833
-What did I do?
-Got him? Chill out.

08:33.867 --> 08:35.533
-Got it.
-What's goin' on?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.267
What did I do?
-We'll talk about it.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.067
-Aw...
-What's your name, bud?

08:41.067 --> 08:43.967
-Caleb.
-Okay.

08:44.067 --> 08:46.367
-What happened?
-What happened
over at the house right now?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.133
-Me and my mom
got into it.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.167
Yeah, I told him
I was gonna beat him up.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.800
I told him I was gonna
beat him up.

08:51.833 --> 08:54.433
-You ready?
-There's nobody in the car,
I swear to god.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.633
Sir, I swear to god.

08:55.667 --> 08:59.233
-Stand up for me.
-What the...

09:00.767 --> 09:03.167
-Ready, Sarge?
-Yeah.

09:06.433 --> 09:10.600
-Uh, we had a bomb dog
that's trained in searching
for gunpowder residue

09:10.633 --> 09:14.233
and bomb materials
and gonna be checkin' the car,

09:14.267 --> 09:16.400
see if he hits on any type
of firearms.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.833
Casey, is it hittin'
on anything?

09:24.867 --> 09:26.667
-Center console's
really interesting him.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.667
-It appears that the dog
is hitting on, uh, some
gunpowder residue.

09:36.533 --> 09:39.533
Yeah.
Underneath the shifter.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.800
Yeah, it's-- this is a very
common hiding spot
for suspects.

09:44.833 --> 09:48.067
Uh, looking in the car,
you can obviously see that
the center console

09:48.067 --> 09:49.367
was tampered with.

09:51.067 --> 09:53.133
Gotta be careful
retrievin' them out of here.

09:53.167 --> 09:55.267
Yeah, it looks like
it's loaded.

09:58.767 --> 10:02.967
It's got six rounds
of, uh, .38 caliber
ammunition in it.

10:07.067 --> 10:09.600
Got some brass knuckles
as well.

10:09.633 --> 10:10.833
These K-9s are invaluable.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.433
Once the dog alerted,
I could see

10:12.467 --> 10:15.267
that the whole center console
had been recently tampered with.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.933
The screws were loose
and it just easily came up.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.867
Once we popped it up,

10:19.900 --> 10:21.667
uh, you could see the gun
stashed right in there.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.933
-Yeah.
-So, good job, man.

10:22.967 --> 10:24.467
-Yeah.
Very happy with that.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.667
-Yeah, your dog never fails.
-Yeah. Great dog.

10:28.933 --> 10:31.033
-Hey, what's your name, man?
-Caleb.

10:31.067 --> 10:34.100
Bro, that gun, I swear to you,
I took it from him.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.967
He pulled it on me,
I had my brass knuckles,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.867
that's why the brass knuckles
and the gun was in the car.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.200
He pulled it on me,
and I t-- I told him
I was gonna break his jaw

10:40.233 --> 10:41.533
with the knuckles.
-Who's that?

10:41.567 --> 10:45.633
-Craig. He has two guns.
He-- he-- he pulled a gun out

10:45.667 --> 10:47.867
on me before,
I promise you, bro.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.000
-How'd you take it from him?
-I snatched it from him.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.633
I pulled out the brass knuckles,
he didn't have--
-So you snatched that gun

10:52.667 --> 10:54.100
right out of his hand
like a movie?

10:54.133 --> 10:56.833
-He didn't have a--
yeah, I'm a bully.
-No, like a movie,

10:56.867 --> 10:59.500
you pulled it out--
-Oh no, not like no movie,
not like that.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.733
But he had a--
I didn't-- all right,
he had it-- he had it

11:01.767 --> 11:03.967
on the side.
He didn't have it pointed
at me, he had it on the side.

11:04.067 --> 11:05.967
And I snatched it
right out his hands

11:06.067 --> 11:07.833
before he could do anything
with it.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.767
-So when I asked you
if there was any guns
in the car,

11:09.800 --> 11:12.067
how come you didn't--
-I should-- I should've
told you, it's my fault,

11:12.100 --> 11:13.800
I understand, I accept
my responsibility.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.367
-Probably would've looked
a little bit more innocent
in this whole thing, right?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
If you'd told me you had a gun
hidden in your center console?

11:18.433 --> 11:20.700
-I know, but sir,
you gotta understand me.
Uh, I'm a young black male.

11:20.733 --> 11:24.233
I'm scared.
-What are you scared for, man?
You could tell we're the police.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.800
-'Cause I don't want--
I don't wanna go to jail.
I knew if y'all woulda

11:26.833 --> 11:29.967
seen the car-- the gun, y'all
wouldn't have believed me
in the first place.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.567
Y'all wasn't gonna believe me
in the first place, bro,
be honest.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.967
-Have you been
convicted of any crimes?
-No, you can look my name up.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.600
-You never been arrested before?

11:36.633 --> 11:38.367
-No, I never
been arrested before, sir.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.100
-What were you doin'
with the brass knuckles?

11:40.133 --> 11:43.067
-I was gonna beat him up
with them, because he said
he was gonna-- he was gonna

11:43.067 --> 11:45.900
beat me up.
Me and my ma got into it,
my ma texted me,

11:45.933 --> 11:48.833
said I-- I was-- I was
(bleep) my girl in her room.
I said I wasn't.

11:48.867 --> 11:52.067
And-- and I told him,
"When I see you I'm gonna
beat you up,"

11:52.067 --> 11:53.500
'cause he's the one
who told my mama.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.600
-So this is about his girl?
-My girl.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.233
-Your girl?
-Yeah.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.800
-Tell me more about that.

11:59.833 --> 12:02.733
-It's just me and my girlfriend,
she said I was (bleep)
my girlfriend in her room,

12:02.767 --> 12:04.700
I was like, "I wasn't."

12:04.733 --> 12:06.267
And then she was like,
"Yeah, you were.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.267
Craig told me."
So I texted Craig
and I told him,

12:08.300 --> 12:10.167
"I'm gonna beat you up
when I see you, bro."

12:10.200 --> 12:12.400
And he-- he didn't say nothin',
so I pulled up.

12:12.433 --> 12:15.933
And he-- when I pulled up,
he went in the closet,

12:15.967 --> 12:17.433
I don't know where
he got the gun from.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.633
He went in the closet,
got the gun while I was talkin'
to my mom.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.733
I turned, he had it
on his side, I snatched it
out his hand,

12:21.767 --> 12:24.767
and I ran outside.
That was--

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
-You think maybe you made
some bad decisions
tonight, man?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.467
-Yeah, yeah, man.
-Think about that,
and I'll be back and talk to you

12:29.500 --> 12:32.233
in a couple minutes,
all right?

12:32.267 --> 12:36.600
-So, this guy's statement
is-- is...

12:36.633 --> 12:38.200
he shows up at the house
with the brass knuckles

12:38.233 --> 12:41.467
to beat this dude up.
The guy pulls a gun out
on him,

12:41.500 --> 12:44.400
so he reaches out
and snatches the gun
out of his hand

12:44.433 --> 12:45.900
and takes it from him.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.200
-(both laughing)
-Likie...

12:47.233 --> 12:48.367
come on.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.900
All right, listen,
these are your charges, okay?

12:51.933 --> 12:54.267
You're gonna be goin' to jail
for possession of the handgun,

12:54.300 --> 12:55.367
all right?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.567
Possession
of the brass knuckles...

12:56.600 --> 12:58.167
and we're still gettin'
his side of the story,

12:58.200 --> 13:00.267
but it looks more than likely
like you're gonna be
goin' to jail

13:00.300 --> 13:04.067
for assault with a deadly weapon
by u-- using a firearm
to threaten him.

13:04.067 --> 13:07.800
-Assault with a deadly weapon?
Bro, I didn't even threaten him
with no gun, though.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.633
-But you-- you have
to understand how it looks
like to us, man.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.833
It looks like
you made a series
of bad decisions tonight.

13:12.867 --> 13:16.267
I have to put both sides
in my-- in my statement.

13:16.300 --> 13:19.233
You might wanna
think about the decisions
you made tonight, man.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.600
-Boruchowitz: So Pahrump
is a bedroom community
to Las Vegas.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.900
Uh, obviously, being so close,
we end up with a lot
of the criminals

13:27.933 --> 13:31.367
that come out of Las Vegas
and think, "Oh, it's
a smaller community,

13:31.400 --> 13:33.433
we can hide there,
we can get away
with our drugs."

13:33.467 --> 13:35.633
But also,
being a smaller agency,

13:35.667 --> 13:37.667
we have a much better
opportunity of catching them,

13:37.700 --> 13:39.233
because we know our criminals,

13:39.267 --> 13:41.433
and we can identify them
much quicker,

13:41.467 --> 13:44.167
and so often that actually
works against them,

13:44.200 --> 13:45.667
and we're able
to apprehend them much quicker

13:45.700 --> 13:47.067
than they are in a bigger city.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.833
So we saw a quad just take off
up here across the street.

13:51.867 --> 13:55.867
They're utilized
by our drug traffickers
regularly because they're easier

13:55.900 --> 13:57.833
to get away from us.

13:57.867 --> 14:03.100
And so utilize them
to run dope back and forth.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.300
And so we're gonna
come up here and do
a traffic stop on 'em,

14:05.333 --> 14:07.600
and, uh, figure out
exactly what they're doin'.

14:13.467 --> 14:15.100
-Woman:
How are you?
-Good, and yourself?

14:15.133 --> 14:17.267
-Good. (indistinct)

14:17.300 --> 14:18.433
-Do you have a license on you?

14:18.467 --> 14:22.067
-Uh, no, I have
my California license.
-Okay.

14:23.833 --> 14:25.900
So do you ha--
you don't have
any identification

14:25.933 --> 14:27.433
on you at all?
-No.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.233
-Okay.
-No.

14:29.267 --> 14:30.567
-Do you have
an actual driver's license?

14:30.600 --> 14:34.233
-Um... no.
-Gotta have
a driver's license.

14:34.267 --> 14:36.367
You can't drive--
-I honestly-- I didn't
know that, I-- I thought

14:36.400 --> 14:39.167
it was... like
the off-road vehicles,
I thought you were allowed to.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.867
-Any vehicle on the roadways,
you've gotta have
a driver's license.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.967
-Okay.
-Do you have anything
that at least would tell me

14:44.067 --> 14:47.100
who you are?
-Uh, the only thing I have
with even my picture on it

14:47.133 --> 14:52.233
is, when I came here
a year ago, I was arrested
and... (laughs)

14:52.267 --> 14:54.300
-You were arrested
and this is your booking sheet.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.333
-Yeah.
-Well...

14:55.367 --> 14:56.567
-That's the only thing I have.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.400
-Okay, that's a step
in the right direction at least.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.867
Do you paint
your own dog's nails,
or do they come that way?

15:01.900 --> 15:04.100
-Paint, I paint them, yeah.
-Yeah?

15:04.133 --> 15:06.433
I'd say you could do her hair,
too, but that probably--

15:06.467 --> 15:08.700
-She doesn't have any hair.
-She doesn't have enough
to do much with.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.700
-(laughs)
-Well, that's a first,
I don't think I've ever

15:10.733 --> 15:13.133
seen a dog with painted--
with toenails.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.067
-She likes it a lot. (giggles)
-Do you have any warrants

15:15.067 --> 15:16.167
that I need to know about?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.733
-You know what?
I had two warrants,

15:17.767 --> 15:20.733
and the attorney said
he'd handle it, and then
I recently found out

15:20.767 --> 15:22.333
that they weren't
taken care of.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.567
-So you're likely
to have warrants?
Is that what you're tellin' me?

15:24.600 --> 15:27.733
-Yeah, for...
displaying a sign.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.600
-Okay, is that
in Clark County?
-No.

15:29.633 --> 15:33.067
-Here?
-No, that's-- no, that's in--
Yeah, that's in Las Vegas.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.567
-Okay.
So the bad news is,
you're gonna go to jail

15:35.600 --> 15:36.633
with us tonight.
-No!

15:36.667 --> 15:38.133
-Yeah.
-Are you serious?

15:38.167 --> 15:39.400
I'm serious.
-No!

15:39.433 --> 15:40.767
-Yes.
-Please don't do this.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.133
-I'm serious.
-Please don't.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.133
-So, go ahead and step off
the four-wheeler.
-Please, please?

15:44.167 --> 15:45.400
-I gotta take you to jail...
-Please.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.067
-...okay?
Go ahead and step off
the four-wheeler.

15:47.067 --> 15:48.200
-I beg you, please don't.
-Go ahead.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.267
Go ahead and walk over here.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.300
Is there somebody
we can call to take your dog
for you?

15:54.333 --> 15:56.200
-Oh...
-I don't wanna have
to send him to the pound.

15:56.233 --> 15:58.533
-Oh, come on, please
don't arrest me, just--

15:58.567 --> 16:01.767
I didn't know.
I swear, promise you
on like-- on everything,

16:01.800 --> 16:03.067
I didn't know.

16:03.067 --> 16:05.433
-Okay.
Well, unfortunately--
unfortunately, today,

16:05.467 --> 16:08.100
you have a warrant
outta Clark County, okay?

16:08.133 --> 16:10.767
And you're driving
suspended revoked
on the highway, okay?

16:10.800 --> 16:12.167
So you're gonna
go to jail today.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.067
-Oh, my God, please--
-So, is there somebody
that we can call

16:14.067 --> 16:16.800
so that I don't have
to send the dog
to the pound?

16:16.833 --> 16:20.367
-Um... yeah, um...
-Who can we call?

16:20.400 --> 16:23.433
-I don't know-- (crying)
-You don't know
who we can call?

16:23.467 --> 16:26.433
-I don't know,
can I get my-- my phone?
-Where is it?

16:26.467 --> 16:30.533
I'll grab it for you.
-It's in my,
uh, bag, I think.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.933
-Okay.
That's all right,
I'll grab it.

16:32.967 --> 16:35.700
-No-- No, you know what?
I-- I didn't even bring it.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.300
I don't even have it.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.967
You don't have your phone?
-No.

16:39.067 --> 16:41.833
I have this, and I have
my broken phone that
I was gonna go get updated.

16:41.867 --> 16:45.467
-I'll call Animal Control,
then, and we'll have them
come get the dog.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.300
Is there anything in here
that I need to know about?

16:48.333 --> 16:51.067
In here?
Is it okay if I look
through it?

16:51.067 --> 16:52.833
-No.
-It's not okay
if I look through it?

16:52.867 --> 16:54.600
-Why-- why-- why
do you need to look
through my purse?

16:54.633 --> 16:56.833
-I'm just asking.
That's something that
we normally do.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.867
-No...
-It would lead me to believe,
based on your behavior,

16:58.900 --> 17:00.600
that there's
something in there.
-No, it's not okay

17:00.633 --> 17:01.900
if you go through my purse.
-Why not?

17:01.933 --> 17:04.067
-Because it's my purse.
It's my personal--
-Okay.

17:04.067 --> 17:08.300
-I'm violated as it is. God!
-Okay.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.067
-What's-- what's in your purse
that you don't want me

17:10.100 --> 17:11.667
to know about?
'Cause there's somethin'
in there.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.333
I've been doing this
a while, 'kay?

17:13.367 --> 17:15.800
I'm gonna ask you--
-No, I don't want you
going through all my stuff.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.800
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.767
-We've got a little puppy here.
-All right.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.133
-And she's going with me.
Go ahead.

17:24.167 --> 17:27.833
She says that she
has nobody's number
that she knows how to call.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.867
-Hi, little one.
All right, go ahead
and let me have her.

17:30.900 --> 17:33.833
-She's spoiled.
-Okay, go ahead and turn around
and put your hands

17:33.867 --> 17:35.767
behind your back.
-Can I kiss my dog?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.733
-Put your hands
behind your back.

17:37.767 --> 17:41.433
-Please. (sobs)
My god.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.600
You don't have anything
on you at all, no drugs,
no nothin' at all, right?

17:44.633 --> 17:46.933
You understand
that if you bring it in
to our detention center,

17:46.967 --> 17:48.567
that that's an additional
crime, okay?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.500
You don't have anything
on you at all, right?

17:50.533 --> 17:52.267
Nothing that's gonna
poke me or stick me?

17:52.300 --> 17:57.533
-No.
-I don't think you're being
completely honest.

17:57.567 --> 18:00.433
And you know as well
as I do that you have
something on you.

18:00.467 --> 18:03.433
Let's be a hundred percent
honest and let me try
to help you.

18:03.467 --> 18:06.433
-How is it gonna help--
how are you gonna help me?

18:06.467 --> 18:08.200
How are you gonna help me?
You're not gonna help me.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.067
You're not helping me.
You're-- I'm in handcuffs.
How are you helping me?

18:11.067 --> 18:12.700
-You're already in handcuffs,
that changes nothing.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.400
-How are you helping me?
How is that gonna help me?

18:14.433 --> 18:16.333
-How am I helping you?
We can start to try
to get you help,

18:16.367 --> 18:18.067
to get you out
of this situations
that you're in.

18:18.067 --> 18:20.767
-Dude, we've been stuck here
a year in this hellhole.
My boyfriend's been

18:20.800 --> 18:24.833
going through the court system
for a year, okay, trying
to get through the system,

18:24.867 --> 18:28.133
just for a stolen vehicle.
I'm supposed to go next week

18:28.167 --> 18:31.267
to get a signed affidavit
to-- to release us
from everything,

18:31.300 --> 18:33.700
so that we can get out,
and we just bought
a motor home.

18:33.733 --> 18:36.367
We're trying to get
the (bleep) out of here,
'cause we hate it.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.567
-Okay.
Deputy Mendoza here
is gonna transport you

18:39.600 --> 18:40.833
to the detention center.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.833
I can help you out
if you have something
on you now.

18:42.867 --> 18:45.433
And that's the part
that you're not listening
to me about.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.067
I'm trying to save you
extra trouble.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.167
You're in trouble
already. Nobody's
disputing that.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.733
You have a problem.
You're going to jail.
That's-- that's truth.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.900
If you go to the jail
with contraband, you're
going to catch

18:54.933 --> 18:56.600
an additional charge.

18:56.633 --> 18:59.467
If you have contraband,
Deputy Mendoza needs
to know now,

18:59.500 --> 19:01.600
so that you don't take it
into the jail.

19:01.633 --> 19:02.833
Last chance.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.433
-I have a pipe
in the bra, okay?

19:04.467 --> 19:06.967
-Okay.
And any narcotics
with it?

19:07.067 --> 19:09.067
-No.
-Where are they?

19:09.067 --> 19:11.067
-Where do you think?
-I don't know.
You tell me.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.467
-Yes, you do know.
-They're in your purse.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.600
-Duh.
-Okay.

19:13.633 --> 19:15.500
-Good.
It took us a while
to get here, right?

19:15.533 --> 19:17.767
What is your drug of choice?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.967
I do speed
because I'm ADHD.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.767
-Okay.
-Okay?
It normals me.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.400
I used to take Adderall,
and I can't take Adderall
anymore, because I don't have

19:25.433 --> 19:27.133
a doctor here.
-Okay.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.067
-In fact, I had surgery,
and I can't even get
a decent-- it doesn't matter.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.867
-All right, Deputy Mendoza's
gonna take you back
to her car,

19:33.900 --> 19:36.067
and we'll bring the rest
of the stuff with us, all right?

19:37.533 --> 19:39.067
So, we're gonna
head to the jail there,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.067
we'll do a search
of the purse
and go through it

19:41.067 --> 19:43.367
and see exactly
what she has in there.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.233
It's a bad day for her,
but hopefully it'll be
the start of a new future,

19:46.267 --> 19:49.400
where maybe she can get
some help for her addiction.

19:49.433 --> 19:52.100
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.767
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.933
Cover is code three.

19:54.967 --> 19:57.933
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)
