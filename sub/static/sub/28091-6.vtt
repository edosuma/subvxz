24:23.517 --> 24:25.297
What's that?

24:25.984 --> 24:28.509
I've never had a job before.

24:29.336 --> 24:32.681
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

24:38.865 --> 24:40.396
Constable Grant!

24:40.620 --> 24:42.176
Mrs. Thornton.

24:42.310 --> 24:43.294
Can this wait?

24:43.319 --> 24:44.904
I have a matter to attend to.

24:44.929 --> 24:46.009
It's about Allie.

24:46.034 --> 24:47.166
I was hoping to talk to you.

24:47.191 --> 24:48.946
Okay, I'll come by.

25:04.907 --> 25:06.943
Well, well, well. Look who it is.

25:06.968 --> 25:08.508
The man of the hour.

25:08.533 --> 25:10.084
I don't know about that.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.709
Oh, you don't have to be modest, Henry.

25:11.734 --> 25:13.420
You're a big success now.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.390
It might cause me a few headaches,

25:15.415 --> 25:17.519
if I'm being honest,
but that's all right.

25:17.544 --> 25:18.934
You've earned it.

25:18.959 --> 25:20.603
Thank you.

25:21.248 --> 25:23.319
Well, I, uh... about that.

25:23.344 --> 25:25.123
You don't have to beat around
the bush with me, Henry.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.396
You're here to quit.

25:26.554 --> 25:28.118
Yes.

25:29.037 --> 25:31.782
I wanna thank you for
all you've done for me.

25:32.649 --> 25:37.986
I know we got off on the
wrong foot a few years back.

25:38.095 --> 25:39.979
I take the blame for that.

25:40.298 --> 25:42.446
I'd like to think that we've done

25:42.471 --> 25:44.337
some good things together since.

25:44.362 --> 25:46.271
We've come a long way, you and I.

25:46.296 --> 25:48.084
Haven't we?

25:49.988 --> 25:53.500
Well, thank you, Henry, for everything.

25:53.525 --> 25:55.334
And I wish you nothing
but the best of luck.

25:55.359 --> 25:57.226
Thank you, Lee.

25:59.586 --> 26:01.505
Say, Henry, um...

26:01.774 --> 26:05.509
you know, we don't get too
many opportunities in life,

26:05.534 --> 26:07.066
to start over.

26:07.465 --> 26:08.984
My advice?

26:10.033 --> 26:11.821
Make the most of this one.

26:20.068 --> 26:22.318
It's callled easy by necessity

26:22.343 --> 26:24.379
It says if a piece of
land is landlocked,

26:24.404 --> 26:25.536
the owner can't be prevented

26:25.571 --> 26:27.349
from accessing that land by road.

26:27.381 --> 26:28.576
But the road's on my land.

26:28.601 --> 26:31.401
Doesn't matter. You can't charge Mr.
Wolf for access.

26:31.426 --> 26:32.892
So they pump the oil from his land,

26:32.917 --> 26:34.717
transport it across my property?

26:34.742 --> 26:36.029
He gets paid and I get nothing?

26:36.054 --> 26:38.014
That is the law, Kurt.

26:38.134 --> 26:39.967
I won't stand for this.

26:43.007 --> 26:45.040
They haven't even found
oil on my land yet.

26:45.065 --> 26:46.326
Gowen found it on his land.

26:46.351 --> 26:47.815
He'll find it on yours soon enough.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.505
Why else would he send
all that money your way?

26:49.582 --> 26:50.897
Sheriff Avery can wrap this up

26:50.922 --> 26:52.389
in all the legal jargon he wants to.

26:52.414 --> 26:54.427
No matter how you slice
it, it's not fair.

26:54.452 --> 26:55.849
If I can find a lawyer I will.

26:55.874 --> 26:57.686
You're fighting about oil?

26:58.220 --> 26:59.473
With all due respect, Mrs. Thornton,

26:59.498 --> 27:00.621
this doesn't concern you.

27:00.646 --> 27:01.861
Your boys go to my school.

27:01.886 --> 27:04.082
You don't think this affects them?

27:04.175 --> 27:06.197
I'm just trying to get my
fair share of an oil option

27:06.222 --> 27:08.127
Mr. Gowen gave to Richard.

27:08.568 --> 27:10.630
So you're threatening
to take him to court.

27:11.384 --> 27:13.341
I have to stand up for what's right.

27:13.530 --> 27:16.094
For what's right or what
makes you the most money?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.443
Look, I'm a teacher but
so are you, Mr. Lawson.

27:22.683 --> 27:26.145
Every day at home you're setting
an example of how to be.

27:26.336 --> 27:28.273
You're better than this.

27:42.392 --> 27:43.902
Is that a problem?

27:44.316 --> 27:48.584
No, but... I'm not just teaching
my students English and Math.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.123
I want them to learn how
to get along in the world.

27:51.148 --> 27:54.217
And part of that is learning
how to work together.

27:58.022 --> 27:59.471
Okay.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.576
I agree with that.

28:01.601 --> 28:04.392
So, how can I help?

28:05.728 --> 28:08.084
Well, perhaps if I
knew more about Allie,

28:08.109 --> 28:09.980
I could help address her needs.

28:12.152 --> 28:15.569
Uh, what do you mean exactly?

28:17.015 --> 28:19.823
For starters, could you
tell me about her family?

28:24.896 --> 28:28.582
My sister passed when Allie was four.

28:29.886 --> 28:33.545
Her dad, he... he wasn't around much.

28:34.205 --> 28:36.215
He eventually just left.

28:37.726 --> 28:40.552
I dunno, maybe the thought
of raising her on his own

28:41.174 --> 28:42.888
scared him off.

28:44.476 --> 28:46.226
And what about her grandparents?

28:46.543 --> 28:48.309
That's just my mom.

28:48.453 --> 28:51.106
And she's too old to raise a young girl.

28:52.276 --> 28:55.150
So it's really just been you
and Allie moving around a lot.

28:56.107 --> 28:57.486
Yeah.

28:58.219 --> 29:00.699
Yeah, that's her in a nutshell.

29:01.733 --> 29:04.285
Allie has experienced a lot of loss.

29:06.106 --> 29:08.407
I believe she pushes people away
before they have the chance

29:08.432 --> 29:10.332
to get close to her.

29:12.929 --> 29:14.801
Why would she do something like that?

29:14.826 --> 29:16.465
To protect herself?

29:17.893 --> 29:20.843
If she pushes people away,
she doesn't have to worry...

29:23.535 --> 29:26.099
She doesn't have to worry
about losing them.

29:33.093 --> 29:38.360
Okay, all right, well
what do you suggest?

29:39.463 --> 29:40.995
Just keep doing what you're doing,

29:41.020 --> 29:43.265
and I'll do whatever I can

29:43.290 --> 29:46.702
to make sure Allie feels
valued and included in school.

29:47.805 --> 29:49.538
She's a very bright young girl.

29:50.046 --> 29:52.042
We won't give up on her.

30:02.237 --> 30:05.260
You look pretty good with that law
book in your hand there, Bill.

30:05.285 --> 30:06.261
Hardly.

30:06.286 --> 30:10.023
From what I saw today, I think
you'd make a good judge.

30:10.048 --> 30:12.237
It's not whether I could
do the job or not.

30:12.262 --> 30:13.687
What is it?

30:13.817 --> 30:16.015
I signed up for the
Mounties for a reason.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.965
You thought you looked
good in red surge?

30:17.990 --> 30:19.519
I look great in a red surge.

30:19.544 --> 30:21.278
[LAUGHS]

30:21.621 --> 30:23.864
No, seriously.

30:26.396 --> 30:29.162
When I was a boy our
town was in bad shape.

30:29.857 --> 30:31.824
Gangs, bandits.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.459
My mother wouldn't even let
us play in the street.

30:35.559 --> 30:37.659
And one day we got a new sheriff.

30:37.684 --> 30:39.208
He stood up to these outlaws.

30:39.233 --> 30:41.632
He risked his life and he
drove them out of town.

30:42.455 --> 30:43.788
He was a good man.

30:43.813 --> 30:45.312
I'm sure he was.

30:45.337 --> 30:46.737
What happened to him?

30:46.790 --> 30:49.431
He passed. Old age.

30:50.502 --> 30:52.352
I was 17 at the time.

30:52.901 --> 30:55.355
I signed up with the
Mounties three months later.

30:56.178 --> 30:58.411
You wanted to be a lawman, like him.

30:58.588 --> 31:01.193
He made a difference in a
lot of people's lives.

31:02.565 --> 31:04.531
Well, the way I see it,

31:04.962 --> 31:06.796
there is more than one way to do that.

31:06.821 --> 31:09.922
By becoming a judge, you get
a chance to right wrongs.

31:10.107 --> 31:12.788
You punish the guilty,
protect the innocent.

31:13.929 --> 31:15.829
I think maybe you should
try on that robe,

31:15.854 --> 31:16.917
see how it feels.

a competitor, Henry.

36:57.678 --> 37:00.051
That would not be a wise move.

37:01.108 --> 37:03.758
I own the mineral rights
to your land as well as

37:03.783 --> 37:05.415
most of the rest of the valley.

37:05.440 --> 37:09.061
That means you own the surface
rights to your property.

37:09.835 --> 37:11.923
I own everything underneath.

37:16.668 --> 37:20.452
And please raise your hands
if you have any questions.

37:31.344 --> 37:33.377
You forgot to carry the two.

37:39.122 --> 37:40.188
Thanks.

37:40.213 --> 37:42.546
Math can be like walking near quicksand.

37:42.571 --> 37:44.772
One mistake and you're sunk.

37:44.797 --> 37:46.515
I guess you're right.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.092
- Lee?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

37:59.117 --> 38:00.312
I have the regional manager

38:00.337 --> 38:02.437
from the National Pacific
Railroad on the line.

38:02.462 --> 38:03.218
<i>Thank you, Florence!</i>

38:03.243 --> 38:04.699
Putting him through.

38:10.793 --> 38:12.859
<i>(CARSON) Okay, promise me you'll try</i>

38:12.884 --> 38:14.561
<i>and keep an open mind about this.</i>

38:14.586 --> 38:16.586
<i>(FAITH) An open mind about what?</i>

38:16.611 --> 38:18.144
Why all the secrecy?

38:18.169 --> 38:20.292
Excuse me, Doctor Shepherd?

38:20.568 --> 38:22.425
Ready for the Hamilton call?

38:22.450 --> 38:23.917
Yes.

38:28.636 --> 38:29.753
Hamilton?

38:29.778 --> 38:31.478
Okay, hear me out.

38:31.599 --> 38:33.833
I found your father's telephone number.

38:33.858 --> 38:35.262
And I think you should talk to him.

38:35.287 --> 38:36.143
No.

38:36.168 --> 38:38.240
Oh, Carson, I can't. It's
been so many years, I can't.

38:38.265 --> 38:39.893
I know, Faith.

38:40.023 --> 38:42.612
He's your father and he loves you.

38:44.150 --> 38:46.282
Just give him a chance.

38:46.728 --> 38:48.410
<i>I have a call for David Carter.</i>

38:48.435 --> 38:51.372
<i>Uh, yes, this is David Carter.</i>

38:53.766 --> 39:00.670
[PHONE RINGS]

39:04.928 --> 39:06.803
<i>Hold for David Carter.</i>

39:12.207 --> 39:13.440
Hello?

39:13.468 --> 39:17.231
<i>Hello Faith. Is that you?</i>

39:18.096 --> 39:19.774
Hi Dad.

39:22.245 --> 39:25.030
<i>I've missed you sweetheart.</i>

39:26.396 --> 39:29.493
[TEARFULLY] Yeah, I've missed you too.

39:29.978 --> 39:31.727
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>
