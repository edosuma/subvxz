WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.404
(man) PREVIOUSLY ON
ABC's "FLASHFORWARD"...

00:03.404 --> 00:05.136
(woman) ALL WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN
IS THAT EVERYONE ON THE PLANET

00:05.136 --> 00:07.738
SEEMED TO HAVE BLACKED OUT
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.

00:07.738 --> 00:10.211
YOU SHUT OFF
THE CONSCIOUSNESS

00:10.211 --> 00:13.084
OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE
FOR 2 MINUTES, 17 SECONDS.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.146
I DIDN'T JUST
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:15.146 --> 00:16.787
IT FELT MORE LIKE
I WAS HAVING A MEMORY,

00:16.787 --> 00:18.619
ONLY IT WAS IN THE FUTURE.
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.691
SO YOU'RE SAYING
EVERYONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS

00:20.691 --> 00:24.024
JUST JUMPED FORWARD SIX MONTHS?
CRAZY AS THAT SOUNDS, YEAH.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.496
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE--
FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS.

00:25.496 --> 00:27.798
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SEEMED TO HAVE AN IDEA

00:27.798 --> 00:31.332
WHY ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING.
I WAS GETTING
A PRENATAL SONOGRAM.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.665
I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT PREGNANT.
I WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN.

00:34.665 --> 00:38.609
(voice breaking)
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.
I DIDN'T SEE A DAMN THING.
WHAT IF I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING

00:38.609 --> 00:41.542
BECAUSE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,
I'M GONNA BE DEAD?
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
ON YOUR HAND?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.175
SOMETHING I MADE FOR YOU.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

00:44.175 --> 00:46.147
AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY. CAR PLOWED
STRAIGHT THROUGH A FENCE

00:46.147 --> 00:48.479
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, HONEY.

00:48.479 --> 00:51.051
I KNOW, OLIVIA.
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
RIGHT THERE.
LOOK RIGHT THERE.
NO WAY.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.686
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?
AND WHY ARE THEY AWAKE?
I'M SORRY. YOU ARE?

00:55.686 --> 00:59.090
HIS FATHER--LLOYD SIMCOE.

01:15.706 --> 01:18.179
(child)
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

01:18.179 --> 01:19.850
â™ª POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª

01:19.850 --> 01:21.282
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª

01:21.282 --> 01:23.754
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª

01:25.356 --> 01:28.189
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

01:28.189 --> 01:29.860
â™ª A POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª

01:29.860 --> 01:31.822
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª

01:31.822 --> 01:36.197
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª

01:36.197 --> 01:38.269
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

01:38.269 --> 01:40.531
â™ª POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª

01:40.531 --> 01:42.873
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª

01:42.873 --> 01:45.176
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª

01:45.176 --> 01:47.338
(children)
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

01:47.338 --> 01:49.740
â™ª POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª

01:49.740 --> 01:52.213
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª

01:52.213 --> 01:53.844
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª

01:53.844 --> 01:56.587
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª

01:56.587 --> 01:59.290
â™ª POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

01:59.290 --> 02:01.522
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª
â™ª A POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª

02:01.522 --> 02:04.825
â™ª ASHES, ASHES â™ª
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

02:04.825 --> 02:06.657
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN! â™ª

02:06.657 --> 02:08.629
TIME'S UP!

02:10.531 --> 02:14.365
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
ME AND MY FAMILY
WERE AT DISNEYLAND.

02:14.365 --> 02:16.637
WHAT DID YOU SEE?
I SAW A PONY.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.710
(boy) I WAS EATING ICE CREAM.
(boy) I WAS WALKING
OUT OF MY ROOM.

02:19.710 --> 02:21.842
(boy) WHAT DID YOU SEE?
(Charlie)
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.315
IT'S BLACKOUT.
EVERYONE HAS TO PLAY.

02:24.315 --> 02:27.518
I DON'T WANT TO.
YOU HAVE TO TELL.
THAT'S THE RULE.

02:27.518 --> 02:30.621
HEY, GIVE HIM BACK!
NOT UNTIL YOU TELL!

02:30.621 --> 02:32.523
(children shouting indistinctly)
(rip)

02:32.523 --> 02:35.186
(woman grunts) CHARLIE!

02:35.186 --> 02:38.429
CHARLIE! CHARLIE, YOU KNOW
WE DON'T HIT AT SCHOOL.

02:38.429 --> 02:41.161
(grunts)
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME RIGHT NOW,
YOUNG LADY--CH--CHARLIE!

02:41.161 --> 02:42.463
(woman) COME BACK HERE!
(grunting)

02:42.463 --> 02:44.665
CHARLIE! COME BACK HERE!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.937
CHARLIE!

02:49.169 --> 02:50.341
CHARLIE!

02:50.341 --> 02:52.843
CHARLIE!
(tires screech)

02:52.843 --> 02:54.775
(tires screech)

03:02.213 --> 03:05.686
(helicopter whirring)

03:21.272 --> 03:23.404
SIX AGENTS RESIGNED
THIS MORNING.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.477
THAT'S A GRAND TOTAL OF 18
IN THE PAST 3 DAYS.

03:26.477 --> 03:29.410
NOW I KNOW WE'RE ALL MORE THAN
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT RIGHT NOW.

03:29.410 --> 03:33.444
EVERYBODY IN THIS BUILDING
IS SCARED OR HOPEFUL

03:33.444 --> 03:35.286
OR CONFUSED
ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW.

03:35.286 --> 03:37.448
BUT UNLIKE EVERYBODY
OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING,

03:37.448 --> 03:40.951
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO PUT ALL THAT ASIDE

03:40.951 --> 03:42.953
BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES
PEOPLE LOOK TO

03:42.953 --> 03:45.626
WHEN THEIR WORLD
GOES TO PIECES.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.628
(clapping)

03:47.628 --> 03:49.960
WOW.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.603
IT WAS WORTH TAKING
MILITARY TRANSPORT

03:52.603 --> 03:56.967
FROM WASHINGTON
FOR THAT LITTLE SPEECH.
DEPUTY SECRETARY
ANASTASIA MARKHAM,

03:56.967 --> 03:59.470
HOMELAND SECURITY.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.542
I HEARD THERE WAS
AN FBI FIELD OFFICE

04:01.542 --> 04:04.345
WHICH APPOINTED THEMSELVES
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE

04:04.345 --> 04:06.377
FOR INVESTIGATING
THE BLACKOUT.

04:06.377 --> 04:08.319
IF THERE'S ANOTHER OFFICE
OR AGENCY

04:08.319 --> 04:10.321
THAT HAD A VISION
OF THIS INVESTIGATION

04:10.321 --> 04:13.854
AND HAS MORE INFORMATION
THAN WE DO, LET ME KNOW...
(cell phone vibrates)

04:13.854 --> 04:16.387
AND I'LL SEND 'EM
OUR CASE FILE.

04:16.387 --> 04:19.029
EXCUSE ME.
PROBLEM AT MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL.

04:21.292 --> 04:24.335
(Olivia) SO WHAT WERE
THEY DOING WHEN IT HAPPENED?

04:24.335 --> 04:26.337
(woman) THEY WERE
PLAYING BLACKOUT.

04:26.337 --> 04:28.038
IT'S THE SAME KIND
OF ROLE-PLAYING

04:28.038 --> 04:30.801
THAT WE SAW AFTER 9/11
AND KATRINA.

04:30.801 --> 04:33.043
SORRY, I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S ALL THAT DIFFERENT

04:33.043 --> 04:36.847
FROM THE OTHER CHILDREN.
WELL, THE OTHER CHILDREN--
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:36.847 --> 04:39.480
WHAT THEY SAW,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.884
BUT THE FACT THAT CHARLIE HASN'T
SUGGESTS SOMETHING DEEPER.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.916
SO IS EVERYTHING
OKAY AT HOME?

04:45.916 --> 04:48.889
(whoosh)
I WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN.

04:50.561 --> 04:53.564
YEAH. WE'RE FINE.

04:53.564 --> 04:56.997
HAS SHE DISCUSSED ANYTHING
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SEEN?

04:56.997 --> 05:01.972
WE'RE TAKING THE "SHE'LL TELL US
WHEN SHE'S READY TO" APPROACH.

05:01.972 --> 05:03.974
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
RETHINKING THAT

05:03.974 --> 05:05.876
AND ASKING HER.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.513
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY,

05:12.513 --> 05:15.486
NEITHER OF US
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

05:15.486 --> 05:16.917
BUT?

05:16.917 --> 05:20.351
CHARLIE WASN'T IN
MY FLASH-FORWARD.

05:20.351 --> 05:24.725
I'M ASSUMING SHE WAS
AT HOME WITH YOU.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.427
JUST SAY IT, MARK.

05:26.427 --> 05:30.060
YOU SAW ANOTHER MAN...

05:30.060 --> 05:32.062
SOMEBODY WHO--

05:32.062 --> 05:34.765
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET, SOMEONE
WHO EVEN IF I DID MEET,

05:34.765 --> 05:37.037
I'D TURN AROUND
AND WALK THE OTHER WAY.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.870
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.873
BUT IN YOUR... VISION...

05:42.873 --> 05:44.875
YOU WERE INVOLVED
WITH HIM.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.718
YOU SAID YOU HAD
FEELINGS FOR HIM,

05:47.718 --> 05:49.720
AND HE WAS IN OUR HOUSE.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.122
WHAT IF CHARLIE
SAW THE SAME GUY, TOO?

05:52.122 --> 05:54.685
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT CHARLIE SAW.

05:54.685 --> 05:56.927
IT WAS 10:00 AT NIGHT.
SHE HAD TO HAVE BEEN HOME.

05:56.927 --> 06:01.992
COME ON. IT'S THE MOST LIKELY
SCENARIO, AND WE BOTH KNOW IT.

06:01.992 --> 06:06.767
SHE'S UPSET 'CAUSE SHE THINKS
HER FAMILY'S GONNA FALL APART.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.039
I'M NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.972
I'M NOT GONNA LET SOME MAN
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET COME IN

06:11.972 --> 06:14.875
AND THREATEN WHAT WE HAVE,
WHAT WE'VE BUILT TOGETHER.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.047
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:17.047 --> 06:19.049
OF COURSE NOT.

06:19.049 --> 06:23.514
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT WE GOTTA SHOW CHARLIE

06:23.514 --> 06:25.916
THAT MOM AND DAD
ARE STILL GOOD.

06:27.788 --> 06:31.061
ARE WE GOOD, OLIVIA?

06:35.426 --> 06:37.798
WELL, I MET WITH
A DIVORCE ATTORNEY THIS MORNING.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.771
THAT'S FUNNY.
I MET WITH MINE LAST NIGHT.

06:40.771 --> 06:43.804
YEAH, SO WE'RE A DISASTER.
DEFCON ONE, AT LEAST.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.636
OR LIKE DEFCON PLUS ONE.

06:45.636 --> 06:48.909
YEAH, IF IT EXISTS.
(chuckles)

06:53.844 --> 06:56.847
IT'S GONNA TAKE A HELL
OF A LOT MORE THAN FATE

06:56.847 --> 06:59.950
IF YOU WANT TO GET RID
OF ME.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.122
WE'RE GONNA BEAT THIS,
OLIVIA.

07:05.696 --> 07:09.700
NOW LET ME GET THIS RIGHT.
YOU TOOK IT ON YOURSELF

07:09.700 --> 07:14.064
TO USE BUREAU FUNDS
TO MAKE A WEB SITE?
WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT
THE MOSAIC COLLECTIVE,

07:14.064 --> 07:17.007
AND WHAT THE WEB SITE DOES
IS IT ASKS PEOPLE TO POST

07:17.007 --> 07:19.109
WHAT THEY SAW
DURING THEIR VISIONS.

07:19.109 --> 07:21.111
NOW IN THE 17 HOURS
SINCE THE SITE HAS GONE LIVE,

07:21.111 --> 07:24.444
WE'VE GOTTEN
OVER 600,000 RESPONSES.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.818
SO FAR IT CONFIRMS THE THEORY
THAT IF YOU PUT THE DESCRIPTIONS

07:27.818 --> 07:29.820
OF PEOPLES' VISIONS TOGETHER,

07:29.820 --> 07:32.553
YOU DO START TO GET
A DEFINITIVE PICTURE--A MOSAIC--

07:32.553 --> 07:34.525
OF APRIL 29th.

07:34.525 --> 07:37.628
NOW WE'RE USING N.S.A.'s
ECHELON NETWORK ALGORITHM

07:37.628 --> 07:41.091
TO INTERCEPT ANY SUSPICIOUS
WORDS AND TO LOOK FOR PATTERNS.

07:41.091 --> 07:43.894
NOW THE HOPE IS THOSE PATTERNS
WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD

07:43.894 --> 07:45.896
TO AN EXPLANATION
OF WHAT CAUSED THE BLACKOUT

07:45.896 --> 07:48.599
SO WE CAN AT LEAST
PREVENT ANOTHER ONE.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.641
YOU'RE SPENDING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS ON A HOPE?

07:50.641 --> 07:52.973
MM-HMM.
COMFORTING.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.546
BUT HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

07:55.546 --> 07:58.909
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT
THIS WAS A SCHEDULED EVENT?

07:58.909 --> 08:01.912
WELL, THE BLACKOUT HAPPENED
AT EXACTLY 11:00 A.M.

08:01.912 --> 08:03.914
PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.987
THERE'S 60 MINUTES IN AN HOUR,
60 SECONDS IN A MINUTE.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.660
SO THE CHANCES
OF SOMETHING HAPPENING

08:09.660 --> 08:13.193
AT EXACTLY THE TOP
OF ANY HOUR ARE 1 IN 3,600.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.896
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ODDS
OF THIS HAPPENING BY CHANCE

08:15.896 --> 08:17.528
ARE VANISHINGLY REMOTE.

08:17.528 --> 08:20.601
I MEAN, I COULD GIVE YOU
A LIST AS LONG AS MY ARM

08:20.601 --> 08:23.774
OF UNSCHEDULED EVENTS
HAPPENING TO COINCIDE

08:23.774 --> 08:26.907
WITH THE TOP OF AN HOUR.
EXACTLY. RIGHT NOW
THIS IS ALL SUPPOSITION.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.880
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING
THAT ALIENS DID THIS.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.912
OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING
IT'S THE RAPTURE.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.514
BUT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
IS NOT GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT

08:34.514 --> 08:36.717
WITH UNSUPPORTED ACCUSATIONS,
THEORIES

08:36.717 --> 08:38.719
AND HYPOTHETICAL
FLIGHTS OF FANCY.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.691
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THIS?

08:40.691 --> 08:42.653
OUR "HYPOTHETICAL
FLIGHT OF FANCY."

08:42.653 --> 08:45.926
THIS WAS TAKEN
AT DETROIT'S OXIDE SUPER-STADIUM

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
ABOUT MIDWAY
THROUGH THE BLACKOUT.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.762
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THIS WAS
THE ONLY PERSON ON THE PLANET

08:51.762 --> 08:54.034
THAT WAS AWAKE AT THAT TIME.
AWAKE?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.107
MM-HMM. WE DON'T KNOW
HOW HE OR SHE IS IMMUNE OR WHY,

08:57.107 --> 09:00.671
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S GOTTEN OUR ATTENTION,

09:00.671 --> 09:04.715
AND NOW IT'S GOTTEN YOURS
AS WELL.

09:04.715 --> 09:06.977
OKAY, JUST LIKE WE SAID
IN THE CAR, BABE.

09:06.977 --> 09:08.949
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUPER GOOD...
YES, MOMMY.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.951
AND I'M GONNA FIND DEBBIE,

09:10.951 --> 09:14.024
AND SHE'S GONNA HELP
TAKE CARE OF YOU.
HEY, CHARLIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:14.024 --> 09:16.126
HEY. A LITTLE INCIDENT
AT SCHOOL,

09:16.126 --> 09:19.059
AND THE BABYSITTER'S GONE
A.W.O.L. WHAT DO WE GOT?
AH. WELL,
ADMITS ARE LEVELING OFF,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.131
WHICH IS GOOD,
BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT

09:21.131 --> 09:24.635
OF HALLWAYS TO PUT BEDS IN.
HOW ABOUT THAT TRUCK DRIVER?
DID YOU GET HIM EXTUBATED?

09:24.635 --> 09:26.937
YEAH, AND HIS SATs
ARE HOLDING. ALSO MR. SIMCOE,

09:26.937 --> 09:29.900
FATHER OF THE M.V.A. BOY--
HE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.
OH, YEAH, I'VE GOT TO TRY
AND GET THERE.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.343
IT'S JUST ALL I CAN DO TO GET
OUT OF THE O.R. AND WORK.
WHAT ABOUT SQUIRRLIO?
HE'S HURT.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.575
INTENSIVE CARE?

09:39.349 --> 09:42.182
YOU'RE HURTING HIM, MOM.
I'M MAKING HIM BETTER.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.986
YOU--YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
REALLY HELP HIS RECOVERY

09:45.986 --> 09:47.988
IS 10 CCs OF MILK
AND COOKIES, STAT.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.290
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT
FOR ME, DOCTOR? NICE.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.763
GO FIND DEBBIE.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.765
DR. BENFORD, I PRESUME?
MM-HMM.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.927
I'M LLOYD SIMCOE.

10:12.683 --> 10:15.085
OH, THIS IS AWKWARD.

10:15.085 --> 10:17.117
WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.
A SIMPLE APOLOGY

10:17.117 --> 10:20.851
FOR AVOIDING MY SON'S BEDSIDE,
AND WE CAN MOVE RIGHT ALONG.

10:20.851 --> 10:24.394
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DON'T KNOW ME FROM ADAM,

10:24.394 --> 10:26.626
BUT TRUST ME, I CAN BE
REALLY QUITE FORGIVING.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.000
I'M SORRY.
YOU AND I HAVE NEVER MET?
YEAH,
THAT'S THE GENERAL OBJECTION

10:30.000 --> 10:33.003
I WAS TRYING TO CONVEY.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.936
(whoosh)
SORRY, I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.740
I-I'VE BEEN CAMPED OUT

10:39.740 --> 10:42.112
AT MY SON'S BEDSIDE
FOR THREE DAYS

10:42.112 --> 10:43.944
WAITING TO MEET
THIS MYSTERIOUS SURGEON

10:43.944 --> 10:46.847
WHO APPARENTLY SAVED HIS LIFE.
I AM SO SORRY.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.949
IT'S--IT'S JUST EVER
SINCE THE BLACKOUT,

10:48.949 --> 10:51.421
I'M COMPLETELY SLAMMED
WITH WORK, SO THAT'S WHY.

10:51.421 --> 10:53.724
I CAN TELL.

10:53.724 --> 10:55.826
I'M SURE YOUR SON
HAS A FAVORITE TOY.

10:55.826 --> 10:58.859
I REALLY DON'T KNOW, HONESTLY.
UM...

10:58.859 --> 11:01.932
WELL, HIS CONDITION MAKES HIM
A LITTLE HARD TO READ.

11:01.932 --> 11:04.865
HE'S AUTISTIC.
OH, WHERE IS HE
ON THE SPECTRUM?

11:04.865 --> 11:07.097
I'M NOT ALL THAT FAMILIAR
WITH THE TERMINOLOGY.

11:07.097 --> 11:09.099
UH, DYLAN'S MOTHER AND I
SEPARATED

11:09.099 --> 11:11.802
SOON AFTER HE WAS DIAGNOSED.

11:11.802 --> 11:13.974
I'M SURE THE TIMING WASN'T
COINCIDENTAL, AND IT--SORRY.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.046
UH, LOOK, THE POINT IS,
I'M A LITTLE AT SEA

11:16.046 --> 11:18.048
IN DEALING
WITH HIS CONDITION,

11:18.048 --> 11:20.080
AND, WELL,
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

11:20.080 --> 11:22.853
HIS MOTHER--
WELL, MY--MY WIFE--

11:22.853 --> 11:24.855
SHE DIED
DURING THE BLACKOUT.

11:24.855 --> 11:26.817
I HEARD THAT.
I'M SO SORRY.

11:26.817 --> 11:28.288
THANK YOU.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.360
ACTUALLY, I STILL HAVEN'T
WORKED UP THE COURAGE

11:30.360 --> 11:32.963
TO GIVE DYLAN THE NEWS,
AND--OH, SO SORRY.

11:32.963 --> 11:36.466
UM, AND--AND I-I STILL HAVE
A FAIR NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

11:36.466 --> 11:38.068
REGARDING HIS CONDITION.

11:38.068 --> 11:41.101
SURE. YOU ARE IN EXCELLENT HANDS
WITH DR., UM, VARLEY.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.775
HE CAN REALLY ANSWER
MOST OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

11:46.777 --> 11:49.840
RIGHT.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.842
OH, UM...

11:51.842 --> 11:54.014
VERY BEST OF LUCK
WITH THE PROCEDURE.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.959
(indistinct conversations)

12:08.959 --> 12:11.361
HEY, EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH CHARLIE?

12:11.361 --> 12:13.033
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.066
THAT HOMELAND SECURITY HAG
STILL LURKING AROUND?

12:16.066 --> 12:18.839
YEAH, SHE'S IN WEDECK'S OFFICE
GIVING HIM A COLONOSCOPY.

12:18.839 --> 12:22.042
HEY. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

12:22.042 --> 12:25.475
OH, CHARLIE MADE IT FOR ME.

12:25.475 --> 12:28.879
WAS THAT THE SAME ONE
FROM YOUR VISION?

12:28.879 --> 12:30.120
(whoosh)

12:30.120 --> 12:32.182
YEAH.

12:32.182 --> 12:34.184
AND YOU'RE WEARING IT?

12:34.184 --> 12:36.286
YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS.

12:36.286 --> 12:38.829
CHARLIE'S IN FREE FALL
RIGHT NOW.

12:38.829 --> 12:41.992
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS HER FREAKING OUT

12:41.992 --> 12:45.195
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
ACCEPT HER GIFT.
THEN DO SOMETHING THAT
DOESN'T INVOLVE WEARING IT.

12:45.195 --> 12:47.067
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, DEM?

12:47.067 --> 12:51.041
YOU PUTTING ON
THAT BRACELET...

12:51.041 --> 12:53.343
IT'S LIKE SAYING YOU WANT
THE FUTURE TO HAPPEN.

12:53.343 --> 12:59.149
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T.

12:59.149 --> 13:03.013
BUT LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT
WHY YOU'RE SO WORKED UP HERE.

13:03.013 --> 13:06.016
IT'S NOT MY FUTURE
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

13:06.016 --> 13:09.519
IT'S YOURS.

13:09.519 --> 13:12.122
WHAT IF I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
BECAUSE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,

13:12.122 --> 13:14.394
I'M GONNA BE DEAD?
YOU'RE PANICKED OVER
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.396
BUT IF THESE FLASH-FORWARDS

13:16.396 --> 13:18.228
REALLY ARE A WINDOW
INTO THE FUTURE,

13:18.228 --> 13:21.031
THEN WE'VE GOTTA DO
EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN

13:21.031 --> 13:23.073
TO USE THEM
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

13:23.073 --> 13:25.405
(whoosh)

13:27.978 --> 13:30.280
WHAT ABOUT D. GIBBONS? HAVE WE
MADE ANY HEADWAY WITH THE NAME?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.943
THERE'S ABOUT 15,000
D. GIBBONS WORLDWIDE--

13:32.943 --> 13:35.315
4,000 IN THE U.S.,
AND OF THOSE,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.317
ABOUT A THOUSAND HAVE
CRIMINAL RECORDS.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.489
BUREAU'S WORKING
WITH SOME LOCAL P.D.s

13:39.489 --> 13:42.953
TO KNOCK ON DOORS,
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

13:42.953 --> 13:45.956
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF D. GIBBONS
IS IMPORTANT. REMEMBER THAT.

13:45.956 --> 13:50.430
THAT NAME WAS ON MY OFFICE WALL
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW.
(whoosh)

13:50.430 --> 13:52.062
THIS PERSON IS IMPORTANT.

13:52.062 --> 13:55.435
HEY. YOU GUYS READY
TO HAVE YOUR WORLD ROCKED?

13:55.435 --> 13:58.568
YOU KNOW OUR PERSON
OF INTEREST--D. GIBBONS?

13:58.568 --> 14:01.471
WELL, SHE JUST STROLLED
INTO OUR OFFICE

14:01.471 --> 14:04.044
ASKING FOR
AN AGENT DEMETRI NOH.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.047
(both speaking indistinctly)

14:17.527 --> 14:20.460
UH, MY NAME IS DIDI GIBBONS,
SHORT FOR DEIRDRE.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.132
I'M 45 YEARS OLD.

14:22.132 --> 14:24.965
I LIVE IN ANAHEIM,
AND I OWN A CUPCAKE STORE--

14:24.965 --> 14:28.168
DiDELICIOUS CUPCAKES.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.971
I BROUGHT SOME.
(box rattling)

14:30.971 --> 14:36.106
I HAVE PEANUT BUTTER CHIP,
CARROT CAKE AND RED VELVET.

14:36.106 --> 14:38.048
THEY'RE QUITE GOOD.

14:38.048 --> 14:41.351
WELL,
I'VE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.

14:41.351 --> 14:43.883
I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH
AS A SPEEDING TICKET

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
AND...

14:45.885 --> 14:48.018
(exhales deeply)
BUT I'M NERVOUS.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.020
YOU'RE ALREADY
INVESTIGATING ME,

14:50.020 --> 14:52.322
AND--AND I HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING YET,

14:52.322 --> 14:54.224
OR I W--I WON'T.

14:54.224 --> 14:57.027
DID YOU SEE SOMETHING
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD?

14:57.027 --> 14:59.029
IT WAS SO STRANGE.

14:59.029 --> 15:01.101
I WAS IN MY STORE,

15:01.101 --> 15:05.105
AND I WAS ARGUING
ON THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE.
I TOLD YOU...

15:05.105 --> 15:09.980
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
ANY COCKADOODY PIGEONS.
I WAS ANGRY. I WAS SO SNIPPY.

15:09.980 --> 15:13.413
YOU NEED TO TALK
TO AGENTS BENFORD AND NOH.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.686
THEY'RE WITH THE FBI.
CRIMINY, IT IS NOH!

15:16.686 --> 15:19.019
N-O-H. IT'S HIS LAST NAME--

15:19.019 --> 15:23.123
CHINESE OR MONGOLESE OR ONE--
ONE OF THE -ESE. ASIAN.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.426
I DON'T KNOW! JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE! THAT WAS GOOD.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.960
IN MY CHURCH, WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THESE VISIONS,

15:29.960 --> 15:31.531
WHAT THEY MIGHT MEAN,

15:31.531 --> 15:34.504
AND MY PASTOR
SUGGESTED I CONTACT YOU.

15:34.504 --> 15:39.109
SO I CALLED FBI OFFICES
UNTIL I FOUND AN AGENT NOH.

15:39.109 --> 15:43.343
IT'S KOREAN, BY THE WAY.
(whispers) I'M A GOOD PERSON.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.575
SHE COULD BE LYING.

15:45.575 --> 15:48.378
I MEAN, WE CAN'T JUST
TAKE PEOPLE AT THEIR WORD

15:48.378 --> 15:51.081
WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW.
DID SHE LOOK LIKE
SHE WAS LYING?

15:51.081 --> 15:54.084
NO, BUT IT'S PRETTY CONVENIENT,
HER WALKING IN HERE LIKE THIS

15:54.084 --> 15:56.256
WITH THE CUPCAKES AND THE SNIPPY
AND THE--AND THE PIGEONS.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.458
COULD BE NOTHING.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.161
COULD BE THE KEY
THAT UNLOCKS EVERYTHING.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.663
ACCORDING TO YOUR YEARS
OF INVESTIGATING

16:03.663 --> 16:05.495
GLOBAL BLACKOUTS, RIGHT?

16:05.495 --> 16:08.668
MARK'S RIGHT. AT THIS POINT,
ANY DETAIL COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.500
RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.543
I'M GONNA LOG THESE IN
TO, UH, EVIDENCE.

16:13.543 --> 16:14.544
HEY.
YES?

16:14.544 --> 16:16.546
SINCE WE'RE
RUNNING DOWN DETAILS,

16:16.546 --> 16:19.009
WHY DON'T WE CIRCLE BACK
ON WHAT YOU SAW?

16:19.009 --> 16:22.012
I TOLD YOU.
I WAS IN A MEETING.
YEAH, BUT LIKE DEMETRI SAID,

16:22.012 --> 16:24.014
I CAN'T JUST TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT.
WHAT?

16:24.014 --> 16:26.516
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD, GUNMEN
WERE COMING INTO THE OFFICE.

16:26.516 --> 16:29.019
IF YOU WERE IN A MEETING,
YOU WERE HERE,

16:29.019 --> 16:32.022
WHICH MEANS YOU MIGHT
HAVE SEEN SOMETHING.
BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

16:32.022 --> 16:34.024
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?
WHAT?

16:37.367 --> 16:40.430
(blinds clattering)

16:47.077 --> 16:49.509
ALL RIGHT,
I WASN'T IN A MEETING.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.342
I WAS HAVING
A BOWEL MOVEMENT.

16:52.342 --> 16:54.544
(whoosh)
(exhales deeply)

16:54.544 --> 16:58.017
SORRY I ASKED.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU WANTED IT.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.320
NOW YOU GONNA GET
THE BLOW-BY-BLOW.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.722
JUST WAIT.
IT GETS BETTER,

17:02.722 --> 17:05.555
'CAUSE I WAS ALSO ON THE CAN
WHEN THE BLACKOUT HAPPENED.

17:05.555 --> 17:07.757
WHEN I WOKE UP,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

17:07.757 --> 17:10.060
I BANGED MY HEAD AGAINST
THE SIDE OF THE STALL.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.761
I WAS A LITTLE OUT OF IT.

17:11.761 --> 17:15.105
RAFALSKI WAS
IN THE JOHN AS WELL.
WHAT?

17:15.105 --> 17:19.239
SON OF A BITCH WAS DROWNING.
(grunts)

17:19.239 --> 17:21.271
AAH!

17:21.271 --> 17:23.413
WHAT'D YOU DO?
WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID?

17:23.413 --> 17:26.676
(groans)
I GAVE THE POOR BASTARD
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.718
(grunts)

17:30.520 --> 17:34.254
YOU SPEAK ABOUT THIS, E-MAIL,
TEXT, FAX, TWITTER, WHATEVER,

17:34.254 --> 17:36.586
TO ANYONE,
I WILL TRANSFER YOU

17:36.586 --> 17:39.589
TO THE ASS END OF THE CORNFIELD
SO FAST, YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN.

17:39.589 --> 17:42.532
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?
YES, SIR.

17:42.532 --> 17:44.664
GET OUT.
(whispers) MOUTH-TO-MOUTH?

17:44.664 --> 17:45.795
GET OUT.

17:45.795 --> 17:48.138
THERE WE GO. FULL RECOVERY.

17:48.138 --> 17:50.840
SQUIRRLIO! SQUIRRLIO!
YOU'RE OKAY.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.243
HE'S STILL A LITTLE TENDER
FROM HIS SUTURES.

17:53.243 --> 17:55.675
IT'S MY RECOMMENDATION
THAT HE REMAIN AMBULATORY.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.808
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
LIKE AN AMBULANCE?

17:58.808 --> 18:02.152
KIND OF. IT MEANS MOVING AROUND.
SO DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A WALK?

18:02.152 --> 18:04.284
LET'S DO IT.
I'M GONNA TAKE EXTRA,

18:04.284 --> 18:06.516
EXTRA SPECIAL CARE OF YOU
FROM NOW ON.

18:06.516 --> 18:10.120
I'M MAKING SUPER-SPECIAL SURE
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE OKAY.

18:10.120 --> 18:13.793
(Mark) I SAW ANOTHER MAN
IN OUR LIVING ROOM.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.497
WHAT IF CHARLIE SAW
THE SAME GUY, TOO?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.129
(whoosh)

18:19.129 --> 18:21.431
HEY, HONEY.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.507
UH, SWEETIE, JUST WAIT UP.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.779
BABY, SEE THAT MAN THERE?

18:29.779 --> 18:32.512
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE?

18:32.512 --> 18:35.215
UNH-UNH. WHO IS HE, MOMMY?

18:35.215 --> 18:39.189
HE'S NOBODY, BABY.
HE'S NOBODY.

18:52.832 --> 18:56.206
DYLAN! WHAT HAPPENED TO DYLAN?
WHO HURT DYLAN?

18:56.206 --> 18:59.739
(crying) WHO HURT HIM?
WHO HURT HIM?
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
BABE, HE'S FINE.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.242
WHO HURT HIM?
MOMMY OPERATED ON HIM.
HE'S FINE.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.775
DEAR HEART,
HOW DO YOU KNOW DYLAN?
I SAW HIM IN MY DREAM.

19:05.775 --> 19:09.148
YOU DID? WHERE WERE YOU?
WERE--WERE YOU AT OUR HOUSE?
WHO HURT HIM?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.181
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

19:11.181 --> 19:14.854
HOW DID HE GET HURT?
WHO HURT HIM? WHO HURT HIM?
OH, BABE.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.187
WHO HURT HIM?
IT'S OKAY.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.529
(speaks indistinctly)

19:31.871 --> 19:34.644
WELL, N.C.I.C. GIVES HER
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.646
AND ASIDE FROM
A FEW PARKING VIOLATIONS,

19:36.646 --> 19:39.379
THE WOMAN IS A SAINT.
(Demetri) MM.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.181
THE ONLY THING EVEN REMOTELY
RESEMBLING ANY KIND OF HICCUP

19:42.181 --> 19:44.354
ARE A COUPLE OF CREDIT CARD
CHARGES MADE LAST WEEK.

19:44.354 --> 19:47.186
IT WAS TWO PURCHASES
ON THE SAME ACCOUNT

19:47.186 --> 19:49.188
AT NEARLY THE SAME TIME--

19:49.188 --> 19:51.861
ONE FOR A MANICURE
IN NEWPORT BEACH AND THE OTHER

19:51.861 --> 19:56.195
AT A GAS STATION IN UTAH,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES LATER.
IT'S A CLONED CARD.
IT'S GOTTA BE A CLONED CARD.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.698
DIDI SAID SHE WAS
HAVING AN ARGUMENT

19:58.698 --> 20:02.332
IN HER FLASH-FORWARD--WITH HER
CREDIT CARD COMPANY, MAYBE.
SICK TO DEATH OF YOU PEOPLE
HARASSING ME.

20:02.332 --> 20:05.675
ARGUMENT ABOUT PIGEONS?
COCKADOODY PIGEONS!

20:05.675 --> 20:08.678
MAYBE THE PIGEON'S A PERSON--
THE NAME OF WHOEVER STOLE

20:08.678 --> 20:12.882
HER CREDIT CARD
AND CHARGED IT IN UTAH.
14 PEOPLE WITH THE LAST NAME
PIGEON IN UTAH.

20:12.882 --> 20:15.885
ANY CRIMINAL RECORDS?
NOT UNLESS
YOU INCLUDE JAYWALKING

20:15.885 --> 20:18.588
AND INDECENT EXPOSURE.

20:18.588 --> 20:22.252
DIDI SAID IN HER FLASH-FORWARD
SHE WAS ARGUING ABOUT PIGEONS.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.954
IS THERE SOMEPLACE IN UTAH
WHERE, I DON'T KNOW,

20:24.954 --> 20:27.226
THERE'S A LOT OF PIGEONS?
WOW. (chuckles)

20:27.226 --> 20:30.830
(Mark) I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S GOOD.
NO, NO, AS THEORIES GO,

20:30.830 --> 20:33.663
THAT ONE'S, UM, THAT ONE'S
REALLY THIN, ACTUALLY.
TELL US AGAIN
WHY YOU'RE THE BOSS?

20:33.663 --> 20:35.705
BECAUSE HE'S A GENIUS.

20:35.705 --> 20:39.509
THERE'S NOT "A LOT OF PIGEONS"
IN UTAH, BUT THERE IS ONE.

20:39.509 --> 20:42.272
PIGEON ISN'T THE NAME
OF A PERSON. IT'S--

20:42.272 --> 20:44.844
IT'S A PLACE--
PIGEON, UTAH.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.377
CONTACT THE BUREAU FIELD OFFICE
IN SALT LAKE CITY

20:47.377 --> 20:50.420
AND GET THEM RUNNING THIS DOWN.
IN THE MEANTIME,

20:50.420 --> 20:53.983
LET'S SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING ELSE FOR US TO GO ON.
EXCUSE ME.

20:53.983 --> 20:57.727
(Wedeck) I UNDERSTAND. GO AHEAD.
(lowered voice) HEY, I'M SORRY.
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

20:57.727 --> 20:59.989
SURE.
UH, SO I TOOK CHARLIE
WITH ME TO THE HOSPITAL,

20:59.989 --> 21:02.992
AND SHE SAW A BOY
SHE RECOGNIZED FROM HER VISION.

21:02.992 --> 21:07.467
DID SHE TELL YOU WHAT SHE SAW?
NO, SHE JUST IMPLODED.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.540
COME TO SEE DADDY WORK,
CHARLIE BEAR?
HI, DADDY.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.743
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.

21:13.743 --> 21:16.306
SHE SEEMED TO REALLY
CARE ABOUT HIM.

21:16.306 --> 21:18.648
SEEING HIM IN HIS HOSPITAL BED,
SHE WAS--

21:18.648 --> 21:20.650
SHE WAS WORRIED FOR HIM.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.652
WELL, 'CAUSE HE WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:22.652 --> 21:24.654
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHERE SHE MET HIM

21:24.654 --> 21:26.656
SOMETIME
IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

21:26.656 --> 21:27.917
MAYBE.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.360
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S UP?

21:32.562 --> 21:34.023
(exhales deeply)

21:34.023 --> 21:37.667
HIS FATHER... THE BOY...

21:37.667 --> 21:39.969
HIS FATHER
IS THE MAN I SAW.

21:39.969 --> 21:43.733
HIS NAME IS LLOYD--
LLOYD SIMCOE.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.075
HIS SON IS--
HIS SON'S YOUR PATIENT.

21:46.075 --> 21:48.638
BUT LLOYD DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.
I'M POSITIVE.

21:48.638 --> 21:50.039
YOU DON'T THINK?

21:50.039 --> 21:52.982
NO, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND I REALIZE THAT I SAW HIM.

21:52.982 --> 21:55.685
BUT BEFORE HE TURNED AROUND,
THE FLASH-FORWARD ENDED.

21:55.685 --> 21:58.348
SO I DON'T THINK HE SAW ME.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

21:58.348 --> 22:01.320
WHAT I SAW.
THIS MAN MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.053
FOR NOW.
OH, COME ON. THAT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU CAN'T PUNISH ME

22:04.053 --> 22:06.496
FOR SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE,
SOMETHING--

22:06.496 --> 22:07.897
I'M NOT. HEY.

22:07.897 --> 22:10.960
I'M NOT PUNISHING YOU, LIVY.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.733
IT'S JUST, WHAT WAS THAT MAN
DOING IN OUR HOME?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.965
I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU, UH,

22:15.965 --> 22:19.709
YOU TOLD ME
YOU HAD FEELINGS FOR HIM.
WELL, YOU SAID YOU WERE OKAY.
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT.

22:19.709 --> 22:22.612
UNTIL THREE DAYS AGO,
YOU'D NEVER MET THIS GUY.

22:22.612 --> 22:25.975
NOW YOU HAVE.

22:25.975 --> 22:28.047
THE FUTURE'S HAPPENING,
LIVY.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.780
WHAT IF WE JUST SAW A POSSIBLE
FUTURE, LIKE A WARNING?

22:30.780 --> 22:33.683
I AM NEVER GONNA BE
UNFAITHFUL TO YOU, MARK.

22:33.683 --> 22:35.585
I DON'T KNOW WHAT "NEVER"
MEANS ANYMORE.

22:35.585 --> 22:38.888
EXCUSE ME. HEY, WE CHECKED WITH
THE FIELD OFFICE NEAR PIGEON.

22:38.888 --> 22:41.391
DIDI GIBBONS' CLONED CARD
JUST GOT RUN.

22:41.391 --> 22:44.664
OUR UNSUB BOUGHT A BUS TICKET.
MAKES SENSE.
PLANES ARE STILL GROUNDED.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.066
TICKET'S FOR TONIGHT. D. GIBBONS
IS BLOWING OUT OF TOWN.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.068
WE GOT A CHOPPER WAITING.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.070
I, UH, I GOTTA GO.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.076
WELCOME TO PIGEON.
I'M SHERIFF KEEGAN.

23:27.076 --> 23:29.078
MARK BENFORD.
THIS IS AGENT NOH.

23:29.078 --> 23:30.980
(speaks indistinctly)

23:30.980 --> 23:33.112
WHY IS THIS MAN SO IMPORTANT?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.915
DID HE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE BLACKOUT?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.917
HE'S A PERSON OF INTEREST.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.419
WELL, WE'VE SET UP A STAKEOUT
ACROSS FROM THE BUS STATION

23:40.419 --> 23:42.421
IN CASE HE DOES SHOW.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.423
IT'S LIKE AN INVASION.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.696
YOUR SALT LAKE CITY FIELD OFFICE
PRACTICALLY SENT AN ARMY.

23:46.696 --> 23:48.698
WE'RE NOT LOOKING
TO HORN IN ON YOUR TURF.

23:48.698 --> 23:50.700
THAT'S TOO BAD.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.962
WE COULD USE SOMEONE
TO TELL US WHAT TO DO.

23:52.962 --> 23:56.836
EVERYONE IN TOWN IS FIXATED ON
THESE VISIONS THEY EXPERIENCED.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.468
DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU?

23:58.468 --> 24:00.570
NOT EXACTLY.

24:00.570 --> 24:03.473
IT'S A LITTLE BORING,
BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

24:03.473 --> 24:05.044
REALLY?

24:05.044 --> 24:06.516
NOTHING?

24:06.516 --> 24:09.749
QUITE FRANKLY, I'D RATHER NOT
BE ANY OTHER WAY.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.220
THE PEOPLE I KNOW,

24:11.220 --> 24:14.053
THE ONES WHO SAY
THEY SAW THEIR FUTURES...

24:14.053 --> 24:16.455
THEY'RE TORTURING THEMSELVES
OVER IT.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.731
LET'S GO.

24:23.593 --> 24:25.895
I WANNA KNOW
EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING

24:25.895 --> 24:28.237
TO IDENTIFY
THIS PERSON IN THE STADIUM.

24:28.237 --> 24:29.999
WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT?

24:29.999 --> 24:32.001
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T THINK
THIS WAS...

24:32.001 --> 24:34.704
WHAT WAS THE TERM YOU USED?
"SCHEDULED EVENT"?

24:34.704 --> 24:38.948
ARE YOU GOING TO BRIEF ME
OR CROW ABOUT THIS SOME MORE?
HONESTLY, I DON'T SEE WHY

24:38.948 --> 24:42.812
I CAN'T DO BOTH
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
WE'RE CALLING HIM
"SUSPECT ZERO."

24:42.812 --> 24:45.154
HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW THIS IS
A "HIM" WE'RE LOOKING AT?

24:45.154 --> 24:47.987
VIDEO FORENSICS.
DO YOU SEE HOW HIS HEAD

24:47.987 --> 24:50.860
IS THE EXACT HEIGHT
OF THE BLEACHER RIGHT THERE?

24:50.860 --> 24:53.222
WELL, THAT IS A 6-FOOT WALL,

24:53.222 --> 24:55.224
AND USING THAT
AS A REFERENCE POINT

24:55.224 --> 24:57.927
AND ACCOUNTING FOR CAMERA ANGLE
AND DISTANCE,

24:57.927 --> 25:01.230
WE CAN ESTIMATE THAT THIS PERSON
IS 5'8" AND 150 POUNDS,

25:01.230 --> 25:03.232
WHICH MAKES THE ODDS
OF THIS BEING A FEMALE

25:03.232 --> 25:06.075
LESS THAN 1 IN 40.
CAN THE IMAGE
BE ENHANCED FURTHER?

25:06.075 --> 25:08.638
DATA SERVICES HAS ALREADY
BLOWN OUT THE PIXELS,

25:08.638 --> 25:10.940
BUT WE'RE SENDING IT
TO THE N.S.A.

25:10.940 --> 25:14.083
TO SEE IF
THE FORT MEADE SUPERCOMPUTERS

25:14.083 --> 25:16.045
CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE WITH IT.
LOOK AT HIM--

25:16.045 --> 25:18.918
WALKING AROUND,
NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD,

25:18.918 --> 25:20.890
NOT THE LEAST BIT SURPRISED,

25:20.890 --> 25:23.753
WHICH MEANS HE KNEW
THE BLACKOUT WAS GONNA HAPPEN,

25:23.753 --> 25:26.596
WHICH MEANS HE WAS INVOLVED.

25:26.596 --> 25:29.258
CONSPIRACY THEORY IS COMFORTING.
IT PRESENTS YOU WITH AN ENEMY,

25:29.258 --> 25:31.961
GIVES YOU SOMEONE TO ARREST,
PUT ON TRIAL.

25:31.961 --> 25:33.963
WELL, THIS IS NOT
A VISUAL EFFECT

25:33.963 --> 25:35.765
WE'RE LOOKING AT.

25:35.765 --> 25:37.767
THIS MAN IS REAL.

25:37.767 --> 25:40.640
I JUST HOPE WE CAN FIND HIM
BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING WORSE.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.943
WHAT'S WORSE THAN CAUSING
WORLDWIDE DEVASTATION?

25:43.943 --> 25:45.615
CAUSING IT TWICE.

25:53.583 --> 25:54.984
HEY, DR. VARLEY.

25:54.984 --> 25:56.986
MY SON'S ASKING

25:56.986 --> 25:59.258
FOR SOME KIND
OF NONHOSPITAL HAMBURGER.

25:59.258 --> 26:04.794
YOU KNOW, WRAPPED IN PAPER
WITH A TOY.

26:04.794 --> 26:07.096
IS THAT SANCTIONED
GIVEN HIS CONDITION?

26:07.096 --> 26:09.969
ACTUALLY, UH, IT'S GOOD THAT
HE'S GETTING HIS APPETITE BACK.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.341
HIS--HIS VITALS
ARE LOOKING GOOD.

26:12.341 --> 26:15.605
YOUR SON'S A FIGHTER.

26:15.605 --> 26:17.607
WELL,
HE'S GONNA NEED TO BE.

26:21.811 --> 26:24.283
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY,
MR. SIMCOE.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.285
WELL,
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

26:29.859 --> 26:31.320
I'VE SEEN THE FUTURE.

26:33.192 --> 26:37.697
LOOK, I KNOW EVERYONE
SAW SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.069
FOR ME,
IT WAS SOMETHING POSITIVE.

26:40.069 --> 26:41.931
FOR OTHERS...

26:41.931 --> 26:44.303
MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING BAD.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.976
BUT EITHER WAY,
I'VE GOTTA BELIEVE...

26:46.976 --> 26:49.278
I DO BELIEVE

26:49.278 --> 26:51.811
THAT...

26:51.811 --> 26:53.813
THERE'S A GIFT
IN THE KNOWING.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.946
THE TEST OF WHO WE ARE NOW

26:56.946 --> 27:00.349
IS WHAT WE CHOOSE TO DO
WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

27:00.349 --> 27:02.351
THAT'S AN AMAZING THING.

27:22.071 --> 27:24.643
(static crackles)

27:24.643 --> 27:26.946
(whispers) GO FOR BENFORD.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.948
It's Keegan.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.020
Your suspect never even
picked up his ticket.

27:31.020 --> 27:33.022
(normal voice) BUT YOU HAVE

27:33.022 --> 27:35.184
THE EXITS OUT OF TOWN
ROADBLOCKED?

27:35.184 --> 27:38.758
Sure, but he could still
make it out of here on foot.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.791
For that matter, we don't even
know if it's a "he."

27:41.791 --> 27:45.194
We don't know
who we're looking for.
DAMN IT. I KNEW IT.

27:45.194 --> 27:47.196
LOOK, MARK,
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT, OKAY?

27:47.196 --> 27:50.199
BUT MAYBE THESE FUTURE CLUES
OF YOURS ARE JUST--
BOGUS?

27:50.199 --> 27:52.671
WELL, I WASN'T GONNA
BE THAT HARSH, BUT YEAH.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.404
FACE IT, IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT
OF A GOOSE CHASE HERE, MAN.

27:55.404 --> 27:58.007
TELL THAT TO DIDI GIBBONS.
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS?

27:58.007 --> 28:01.050
I SAW IT IN MY VISION,
AND IT CAME TRUE.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.682
HAS CHARLIE EVER MADE YOU
ONE OF THOSE BEFORE?
YEAH.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.185
OKAY, WELL, THEN IT'S NOT
THAT AMAZING.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.888
COINCIDENCES HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.890
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED
COINCIDENCES.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.963
PEOPLE SEE PATTERNS
IN TEA LEAVES AND CLOUDS.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.895
COME ON.
(pats arm)

28:15.895 --> 28:17.466
LET'S GO HOME.

28:17.466 --> 28:19.128
YO.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.972
(Demetri)
SORRY ABOUT THE CIRCUS.

28:22.972 --> 28:24.974
SORRY IT DIDN'T PAN OUT.

28:24.974 --> 28:27.336
SHERIFF,
WHAT IS THAT PLACE THERE?

28:27.336 --> 28:30.139
DIVINE DOLL,
A MOM-AND-POP OPERATION.

28:30.139 --> 28:33.082
THEY WENT BANKRUPT
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

28:33.082 --> 28:36.886
ALONG WITH MOST OF THE TOWN.
IT'S VACANT NOW.

28:36.886 --> 28:37.947
(whoosh)

28:39.348 --> 28:41.050
IN MY VISION,

28:41.050 --> 28:43.222
THERE WAS A PHOTO OF A DOLL

28:43.222 --> 28:46.055
NEXT TO A CARD WITH THE NAME--
D. GIBBONS.

28:48.157 --> 28:51.330
YOU TELLING ME
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE, TOO?

29:08.517 --> 29:11.921
YOU THINK THIS QUALIFIES
FOR PROBABLE CAUSE?

29:11.921 --> 29:14.353
THE COUNTY JUDGE WILL.
HE'S MY FATHER-IN-LAW.

29:17.787 --> 29:18.928
(lock falls)

29:18.928 --> 29:21.931
(door rattles)

29:30.539 --> 29:33.943
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THIS PLACE WAS VACANT.

29:33.943 --> 29:36.105
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

30:15.184 --> 30:17.186
(bell dinging)

30:17.186 --> 30:18.888
(gears squeak)

30:18.888 --> 30:20.950
(children's voices)
â™ª RING AROUND THE ROSIE â™ª

30:20.950 --> 30:24.823
â™ª POCKETFUL OF POSIES â™ª
(whispers) CRAP.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.357
â™ª ASHES, ASHES,
WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª

30:28.357 --> 30:30.900
FBI! OPEN UP!

30:30.900 --> 30:32.932
â™ª WE ALL FALL DOWN â™ª
D. GIBBONS, GET DOWN!

30:32.932 --> 30:35.965
FREEZE! DON'T MOVE!
ON YOUR KNEES!

30:35.965 --> 30:38.607
ARE YOU ALONE HERE?!
ON YOUR KNEES! DON'T MOVE!

30:38.607 --> 30:40.970
DOWN! GET DOWN!
GET ON YOUR KNEES!

30:40.970 --> 30:43.142
(liquid bubbling)
GET DOWN!

30:43.142 --> 30:45.975
(man)
"HE WHO FORESEES CALAMITIES

30:45.975 --> 30:48.878
SUFFERS THEM TWICE OVER."
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

30:50.950 --> 30:52.882
(flames whoosh)

30:54.383 --> 30:55.454
(grunts)

30:55.454 --> 30:56.926
(gunfire)

30:56.926 --> 30:59.028
(bullet ricochets)
OFFICER DOWN!

31:02.992 --> 31:06.465
(loud explosion)

31:17.346 --> 31:20.279
(siren wailing in distance)

31:20.279 --> 31:22.982
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
TAKE HER AWAY.

31:22.982 --> 31:27.286
(woman speaking indistinctly
over police radio)

31:27.286 --> 31:29.989
(camera shutter clicking)

31:33.993 --> 31:36.996
EXCUSE ME. COULD I TAKE A LOOK
AT THE PHOTO YOU JUST TOOK?

31:43.502 --> 31:45.074
(whoosh)

31:49.478 --> 31:52.011
(woman) 3-8-75, repeat
the location and stand by.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.143
THANKS.

31:54.143 --> 31:55.614
SHOOTER'S IN THE WIND.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.147
HEY, DEM, I'M--
I'M SORRY ABOUT KEEGAN.

31:58.147 --> 32:00.149
I KNOW WHAT YOU MUST
BE THINKING BUT--

32:00.149 --> 32:03.052
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THAT LATER?

32:04.954 --> 32:08.527
WHAT WE GOT NOW IS
CELL PHONE AND WHITE QUEEN.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.130
SO WHO'S OUR BOBBY FISCHER
PLAYING CHESS WITH?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.132
EXACTLY.
CHESS PIECES, DOLLS.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.034
WHAT THE HELL
WAS HE DOING HERE, DEM?

32:15.034 --> 32:17.006
E.R.T. GUY'S BEST GUESS
IS HE WAS DOING SOME

32:17.006 --> 32:20.069
HEAVY DUTY COMPUTER HACKING.
ACCORDING TO DATA FORENSICS,

32:20.069 --> 32:22.972
OUR GUY'S BEEN SUPERBUSY
SINCE THE BLACKOUT.

32:22.972 --> 32:25.414
HE'S BEEN HACKING INTO NETS
ALL OVER THE WORLD--

32:25.414 --> 32:28.147
V.L.A. NEW MEXICO,
PARTICLE COLLIDER AT C.E.R.N.,

32:28.147 --> 32:29.518
G.P.S. NETWORK.

32:29.518 --> 32:32.151
HE EVEN TRIED TO HACK
INTO MOSAIC THROUGH THE N.S.A.
WHY?

32:32.151 --> 32:34.483
I THINK HE WAS RULING OUT
POSSIBLE CAUSES.

32:36.625 --> 32:39.188
I DON'T THINK WE'RE
THE ONLY ONES INVESTIGATING

32:39.188 --> 32:41.190
WHY THE BLACKOUT HAPPENED.

32:48.137 --> 32:49.468
DR. BENFORD.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.541
YOUR PATIENT PULLED THROUGH,
I SEE.

32:52.541 --> 32:55.704
(chuckles) I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
GET TO SEE YOUR SON TODAY.

32:55.704 --> 32:59.008
I WAS REALLY BUSY.
ALL HUMAN PATIENTS, I SWEAR.

33:00.349 --> 33:02.281
I SHOULD GET HER HOME.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.683
AH, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE,

33:04.683 --> 33:08.257
THINKING OF A WAY TO TELL MY SON
THAT HIS MOTHER IS DEAD.

33:12.621 --> 33:15.064
WELL...

33:15.064 --> 33:16.695
HOWEVER YOU TELL HIM,

33:16.695 --> 33:18.697
JUST BE SURE
TO TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM.

33:20.729 --> 33:23.032
IS PARENTING
REALLY THAT SIMPLE?

33:23.032 --> 33:26.075
IT'S THE ONLY SIMPLE PART.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.479
TAKE CARE, MR. SIMCOE.

33:30.479 --> 33:34.183
(Nick Drake's "Place to Be"
playing)

33:39.748 --> 33:41.050
(whoosh)

33:41.050 --> 33:43.052
â™ª WHEN I WAS YOUNG â™ª

33:43.052 --> 33:45.424
â™ª YOUNGER THAN BEFORE â™ª

33:48.457 --> 33:52.261
â™ª I NEVER SAW THE TRUTH
HANGING... â™ª

33:52.261 --> 33:54.303
(whoosh)

33:57.436 --> 34:00.539
â™ª AND NOW I'M OLDER â™ª

34:00.539 --> 34:02.371
â™ª SEE IT FACE-TO-FACE â™ª

34:02.371 --> 34:04.373
(exhales deeply)

34:06.145 --> 34:09.278
â™ª AND NOW I'M OLDER â™ª

34:09.278 --> 34:12.281
â™ª GOTTA GET UP,
CLEAN THE PLACE â™ª

34:12.281 --> 34:14.123
I'M BACK, DYLAN.

34:20.189 --> 34:22.691
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE...

34:22.691 --> 34:25.094
BEEN PUTTING OFF
TELLING YOU,

34:25.094 --> 34:29.338
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU
TO GET BETTER FIRST.

34:29.338 --> 34:32.501
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:32.501 --> 34:34.803
OH, YOU REALLY ARE
GETTING BETTER.

34:37.146 --> 34:39.478
I GUESS YOU'RE...

34:39.478 --> 34:41.480
YEAH,
I GUESS YOU'RE WONDERING

34:41.480 --> 34:43.852
WHY YOUR MOTHER
HASN'T COME TO SEE YOU YET.

34:43.852 --> 34:45.614
SHE...

34:45.614 --> 34:47.786
SHE'S NOT HERE.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.860
(sighs)

34:51.860 --> 34:53.862
YEAH, THAT'S R--
T-THAT'S RIGHT.

34:53.862 --> 34:55.394
UM...

34:57.166 --> 35:01.270
YOU SEE, DYLAN, UM...

35:01.270 --> 35:05.534
WHEN THE BLACKOUT HAPPENED,

35:05.534 --> 35:07.876
AND WHEN EVERYONE
FELL ASLEEP...

35:10.339 --> 35:12.441
(whispers) YOUR...

35:12.441 --> 35:15.144
(normal voice) YOUR MOTHER
NEVER WOKE UP AGAIN.

35:17.846 --> 35:20.789
SHE WAS IN AN ACCIDENT,
AND SHE, UM...

35:20.789 --> 35:23.852
SHE DIED?

35:30.459 --> 35:31.630
YEAH.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.565
(sniffles)

35:38.807 --> 35:40.509
BUT...

35:40.509 --> 35:44.913
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME NOW,
KIDDO,

35:44.913 --> 35:47.276
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

35:53.622 --> 35:55.824
(whispers) I LOVE YOU.

35:55.824 --> 35:58.387
I WANNA SEE OLIVIA.

36:04.493 --> 36:06.164
3:00 A.M., GUYS.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.167
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO FALL ASLEEP.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:09.167 --> 36:11.240
WHAT'S GOING ON
IS THAT I'M EATING CROW.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.901
TELL HIM.

36:12.901 --> 36:15.374
I MANAGED TO PULL
THE I.M.E.I. NUMBER

36:15.374 --> 36:18.507
OFF THE CELL YOU AND MARK
RECOVERED FROM UTAH.

36:18.507 --> 36:22.581
AND AS IT TURNS OUT, D. GIBBONS
MADE A SERIES OF SIX CALLS--

36:22.581 --> 36:25.914
FIVE RIGHT BEFORE THE BLACKOUT
TO ANOTHER DISPOSABLE CELL.

36:25.914 --> 36:27.916
WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE MADE CALLS
BEFORE THE BLACKOUT.

36:27.916 --> 36:31.189
MARK WAS ON THE PHONE WITH YOU
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
YEAH, I KNOW,

36:31.189 --> 36:33.862
BUT THE SIXTH CALL WAS PLACED
30 SECONDS INTO THE BLACKOUT.

36:33.862 --> 36:36.665
I TRACED IT...
(types)

36:36.665 --> 36:39.197
TO ANOTHER CELL.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.199
D. GIBBONS WAS
ON THE PHONE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

36:41.199 --> 36:44.603
DURING THE BLACKOUT.
YES, BUT NOT JUST
ANY SOMEBODY.

36:44.603 --> 36:47.436
(types)
THE SECOND CALL WAS PLACED

36:47.436 --> 36:49.438
TO SOMEONE WITHIN RANGE
OF THREE CELL PHONE TOWERS,

36:49.438 --> 36:51.880
ALLOWING ME TO TRIANGULATE
A POSITION.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.882
LET ME ASK YOU THIS--

36:53.882 --> 36:56.214
WHAT KIND OF A PLACE
HAS MULTIPLE TOWERS

36:56.214 --> 36:58.917
TO HANDLE
INCREASED CELL TRAFFIC?
A BASEBALL STADIUM.

36:58.917 --> 36:59.918
YEP.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.851
D. GIBBONS WAS TALKING...
(types)

37:02.851 --> 37:04.993
TO SUSPECT ZERO.

37:04.993 --> 37:08.527
AND THEN THERE WERE... TWO.

37:20.369 --> 37:22.271
HOW MANY POSTINGS SO FAR?

37:22.271 --> 37:24.513
(types)
900,000 AND COUNTING.

37:24.513 --> 37:27.576
THIS SITE'S TAKEN ON
A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

37:27.576 --> 37:29.418
EVERYBODY'S GOT A STORY.

37:29.418 --> 37:31.680
JUST TRYING TO CORROBORATE
WHAT THEY SAW.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.683
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO FUNNY.

37:34.683 --> 37:38.527
I'VE NEVER HAD
THAT "TICKING CLOCK" FEELING.

37:38.527 --> 37:41.760
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER EVEN
HAD THE URGE TO HAVE A BABY.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.793
THERE I WAS...

37:44.793 --> 37:46.495
(whoosh)

37:46.495 --> 37:47.936
(speaks inaudibly)

37:47.936 --> 37:49.738
SOME BLONDE WOMAN

37:49.738 --> 37:51.940
GIVING ME AN ULTRASOUND.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.702
(Demetri) THIS SONOGRAPHER...

37:53.702 --> 37:56.044
MAYBE SHE SAW YOU, TOO.

37:56.044 --> 37:58.847
MAYBE SHE'S OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE,

37:58.847 --> 38:01.910
WAITIN' FOR YOU
TO POST SOMETHING.

38:01.910 --> 38:04.353
YEAH.

38:04.353 --> 38:05.614
(smacks lips) WHY NOT?

38:06.885 --> 38:09.858
(exhales deeply)

38:13.762 --> 38:15.494
(whoosh)
I WANNA KNOW.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.866
IT'S A GIRL.

38:17.866 --> 38:20.969
(crying)

38:20.969 --> 38:24.573
(sniffles) OKAY.

38:24.573 --> 38:27.406
(typing)

38:27.406 --> 38:28.877
THERE.

38:28.877 --> 38:31.309
YOUR TURN.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.012
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
JANIS.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.684
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

38:35.684 --> 38:38.387
SOME PEOPLE JUST THINK
THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE ASLEEP.

38:38.387 --> 38:40.849
OR IT MEANS I'LL BE DEAD.

38:40.849 --> 38:42.351
(scoffs)

38:44.853 --> 38:48.527
I MET A WOMAN TODAY
WHO DIDN'T HAVE A VISION.

38:50.559 --> 38:53.862
FIVE MINUTES AFTER SHE TOLD ME,
SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

38:55.864 --> 39:00.038
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ZOEY
ABOUT THIS?

39:00.038 --> 39:02.441
IN MY EXPERIENCE, UM,

39:02.441 --> 39:03.942
FIANCÃ©ES AREN'T REALLY BIG

39:03.942 --> 39:06.515
ON THEIR GROOMS DYING
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

39:06.515 --> 39:08.517
RUINS THE FIRST DANCE.
YEAH.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.048
HEAVY CORPSE.
(chuckles)

39:10.048 --> 39:12.421
IT'S BAD WEDDING ETIQUETTE
OR SOMETHING.

39:12.421 --> 39:15.654
(laughs)

39:15.654 --> 39:18.557
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA
BE DEAD--

39:18.557 --> 39:20.559
AND THAT'S A BIG "IF"...

39:23.031 --> 39:25.764
DON'T YOU KINDA WANNA KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENS?

39:28.467 --> 39:30.098
I DON'T KNOW.

39:32.641 --> 39:35.143
I DON'T THINK SO.

39:36.745 --> 39:39.748
YEAH, BUT IF YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU CAN PREVENT IT.

39:42.050 --> 39:44.052
AND MAYBE THERE'S SOMEBODY
OUT THERE

39:44.052 --> 39:46.915
THAT HAS INFORMATION
THAT CAN HELP YOU.

39:49.818 --> 39:51.990
WHAT THE HELL.

39:57.626 --> 40:00.028
(sighs)

40:00.028 --> 40:03.031
(typing)

40:10.008 --> 40:12.541
(fire crackling)

40:12.541 --> 40:15.614
HEY,
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

40:15.614 --> 40:19.748
DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU.
GOT BACK LATE.

40:19.748 --> 40:21.019
GINGER ALE?

40:21.019 --> 40:22.190
NO.

40:28.997 --> 40:31.159
HOW WAS NEVADA?

40:32.901 --> 40:35.534
UTAH.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.005
DEAD END.

40:38.767 --> 40:40.068
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:43.742 --> 40:45.744
AT WORK, I'M MAKING MOVES,

40:45.744 --> 40:48.747
BETTING THE FUTURE
IS GONNA HAPPEN AS I SAW IT.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.079
BUT HERE AT HOME,
WITH YOU...

40:51.079 --> 40:53.952
I'M PRAYING IT DOESN'T.

40:56.224 --> 40:57.886
(sets down glass)

40:59.958 --> 41:05.664
DID I DO THE RIGHT THING,
TELLING YOU ABOUT LLOYD?

41:05.664 --> 41:06.965
YOU DID.

41:10.038 --> 41:12.040
WE SHOULDN'T KEEP SECRETS
FROM EACH OTHER.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.242
(whoosh)

41:20.749 --> 41:23.011
WHY'D YOU MAKE A FIRE?

41:23.011 --> 41:25.013
(whispers) NO REASON.

41:35.023 --> 41:38.496
(cell phone rings)

41:38.496 --> 41:39.828
THIS IS DEMETRI.

41:39.828 --> 41:42.130
(woman) Mr. Noh,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

41:42.130 --> 41:45.804
but I'm calling in response
to your Mosaic board posting.

41:45.804 --> 41:49.177
MY POST? ALREADY? WHO IS THIS?
HOW'D YOU GET THIS NUMBER?

41:49.177 --> 41:52.981
I CAN'T DIVULGE THAT, BUT I CAN
TELL YOU MY VISION INVOLVED YOU.

41:52.981 --> 41:56.014
GO ON.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.887
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

41:58.887 --> 42:01.289
I WAS READING
AN INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING,

42:01.289 --> 42:04.022
AND... I AM SORRY.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.524
THERE IS
NO DELICATE WAY TO SAY THIS,

42:06.524 --> 42:11.259
BUT ON MARCH 15th, 2010,

42:11.259 --> 42:13.662
YOU ARE GOING TO BE MURDERED.

42:45.634 --> 42:46.965
YOU'RE HOME, DADDY.

42:46.965 --> 42:49.938
(whispers) SORRY, SWEETIE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU.

42:49.938 --> 42:51.940
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

42:53.942 --> 42:55.944
DADDY?

42:55.944 --> 42:57.245
(normal voice) YEAH?

42:57.245 --> 43:01.149
THE REASON
I WAS BAD AT SCHOOL--

43:01.149 --> 43:03.852
IT'S 'CAUSE THE OTHER KIDS
WERE SAYING

43:03.852 --> 43:06.785
THE FLASH-FORWARDS
ARE GONNA COME TRUE.

43:06.785 --> 43:09.918
ONLY THE GOOD ONES, HONEY.
I PROMISE.

43:09.918 --> 43:13.191
SO IF THE BAD ONES
AREN'T GONNA COME TRUE,

43:13.191 --> 43:15.193
WHY DID PEOPLE HAVE THEM?

43:17.025 --> 43:19.027
THINK OF 'EM LIKE A WARNING.

43:19.027 --> 43:21.169
YOU KNOW,
LIKE WHEN MOMMY'S DRIVING

43:21.169 --> 43:24.232
AND THE TRAFFIC LIGHT
TURNS YELLOW--

43:24.232 --> 43:26.935
IT MEANS THERE'S A STOP SIGN
COMING AHEAD.

43:26.935 --> 43:29.237
SO WE DON'T CRASH.

43:29.237 --> 43:30.839
EXACTLY.

43:30.839 --> 43:33.141
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
MY WARNING.

43:33.141 --> 43:35.944
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

43:35.944 --> 43:37.946
DID YOU SEE
SOMETHING SCARY?

43:39.718 --> 43:42.020
"D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN."
