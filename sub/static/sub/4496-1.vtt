00:25.026 --> 00:30.615
We lived on the wrong side
Of the tracks

00:30.782 --> 00:33.284
But the gentlemen friends
Who used to call

00:33.493 --> 00:35.870
They never did seem to mind at all

00:36.121 --> 00:41.042
They came to the wrong side
Of the tracks

00:41.835 --> 00:47.132
Then someone broke my heart
In Little Rock

00:47.340 --> 00:52.637
So I up and left the pieces there

00:52.846 --> 00:55.640
Like a little lost lamb I roamed about

00:55.890 --> 00:58.351
I came to New York and I found out

00:58.643 --> 01:03.356
That men are the same way everywhere

01:03.982 --> 01:09.988
I was young and determined
To be wined and dined and ermined

01:10.196 --> 01:14.659
And I worked at it
All around the clock

01:15.660 --> 01:18.329
Now one of these days
In my fancy clothes

01:18.538 --> 01:24.043
I'm goin' back home and punch the nose
Of the one who broke my heart

01:24.335 --> 01:27.005
The one who broke my heart

01:27.213 --> 01:30.717
The one who broke my heart
In Little Rock

01:31.009 --> 01:34.929
Little Rock, Little Rock
Little Rock

03:05.019 --> 03:10.650
I learned an awful lot in Little Rock

03:10.859 --> 03:16.322
And here's some advice
I’d like to share

03:17.198 --> 03:19.659
Find a gentleman

03:19.868 --> 03:25.290
Who is shy or bold

03:25.623 --> 03:29.794
Or short or tall

03:30.003 --> 03:35.800
Or young or old

03:36.301 --> 03:41.014
As long as the guy's a millionaire

03:41.514 --> 03:46.978
For a kid from a small street
I did very well on Wall Street

03:47.228 --> 03:52.650
Though I never owned a share of stock

03:52.859 --> 03:55.236
And now that I'm known
In the biggest banks

03:55.486 --> 03:58.072
I’m a-goin' back home
And give my thanks

03:58.323 --> 04:01.034
To the one who broke my heart

04:01.242 --> 04:03.745
The one who broke my heart

04:03.995 --> 04:07.498
The one who broke my heart

04:11.336 --> 04:16.214
In Little Rock

04:30.939 --> 04:32.857
Dorothy, wait a minute.

04:36.861 --> 04:40.740
Louie, ask Mr. Esmond to come
to our dressing room.

04:41.032 --> 04:42.033
Yes, Miss Blake.

04:42.659 --> 04:44.827
Why the rush? He won't run away.

04:44.911 --> 04:47.246
- I know, but I can't wait.
- For what?

04:47.330 --> 04:50.875
Dorothy, didn't you notice?
His pocket was bulging.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.961
It's a bag of gumdrops.

04:53.044 --> 04:55.880
It was square, like a box for a ring.

04:55.964 --> 04:58.299
I think he's got a present for me.

04:58.383 --> 05:02.387
Only you can be on-stage
with a spotlight in your eye,

05:02.512 --> 05:05.348
and still see a diamond
inside a man's pocket.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.184
Thank you, Louie.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.822
Mr. Esmond. Pray, come in.

05:20.905 --> 05:21.990
Thank you, I'd love to.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.866
- Hi, Gus.
- Good evening.

05:23.950 --> 05:28.204
- You were wonderful. Magnificent!
- Thank you.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.998
You were good, too.

05:30.081 --> 05:33.042
Gee, that makes me all warm inside.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.921
- Mr. Esmond!
- Is it the right size?

05:37.005 --> 05:40.842
It can never be too big.
Do you think it's too small, Dorothy?

05:43.511 --> 05:47.849
- It should have a highball around it.
- Does it fit your finger?

05:47.932 --> 05:50.268
Yes, it fits perfect.

05:50.476 --> 05:54.188
Daddy, I'll bet you made me
the happiest girl in the world.

05:59.694 --> 06:03.114
What do you do,
put Novocain on your lipstick?

06:03.322 --> 06:07.201
Daddy? Daddy? May I tell Dorothy?

06:07.452 --> 06:09.120
If you wish.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.665
Dorothy, Mr. Esmond and I
are getting married.

06:12.957 --> 06:16.544
- To each other?
- Of course. Who else to?

06:16.794 --> 06:21.507
I always figured Lorelei would end up
with the Secretary of the Treasury.

06:21.591 --> 06:23.968
Dorothy, guess what,
on Saturday we're sailing

06:24.052 --> 06:25.762
-on the Isle de Paris
-"Ile" de Paris.

06:25.845 --> 06:30.725
- We're getting married in Europe.
- Why not get married here, then go?

06:30.808 --> 06:33.519
- Or is that old-fashioned?
- We've made our plans.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.022
Come in.

06:36.314 --> 06:39.984
A long distance call for you
from Dayton, Ohio.

06:40.151 --> 06:44.155
Thank you, I'll be right there.
Must be Father.

06:44.322 --> 06:48.493
I hope nothing's happened.
I'll meet you at my table, dear.

06:51.329 --> 06:56.417
Father! Never misses, Gus' old man.
Right on cue. Too bad, honey.

06:57.168 --> 06:59.670
Nothing's going wrong this time.

06:59.879 --> 07:04.175
The old boy won't let you
commit matrimony with his son.

07:04.342 --> 07:07.095
He'd rather shove him
down an elevator shaft.

07:07.345 --> 07:12.350
Dorothy, I'm sailing on Saturday
with or without Mr. Esmond.

07:12.558 --> 07:16.437
And I'm not coming back
until he comes and gets me

07:16.938 --> 07:21.859
When we're in France, where
his father can't phone him twice a day...

07:23.111 --> 07:25.696
Gus will never let you go alone.

07:25.822 --> 07:30.326
Sometimes Mr. Esmond finds it
very difficult to say no to me.

07:31.911 --> 07:34.247
Well, that's very possible.

07:46.384 --> 07:50.388
We can't check the roll
if you don't stick together.

07:50.555 --> 07:55.560
Peters? Randall? Sanford? Sims?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.728
- Stevens?
- Look at that.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.439
Stevens? Willard J. Stevens?

08:00.648 --> 08:03.151
- Why don't you answer
- I'm busy.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.114
Boy, oh, boy!

08:08.197 --> 08:10.491
Check your passport right over there.

08:10.575 --> 08:13.369
Is this the way to Europe, France?

08:13.452 --> 08:14.704
To where?

08:14.787 --> 08:17.498
No, honey. France is in Europe.

08:17.582 --> 08:19.333
Who said it wasn't?

08:19.417 --> 08:22.587
Would you say, "North America, Mexico"?

08:23.087 --> 08:26.174
- If that's where I wanted to go.
- The dealer passes.

08:26.424 --> 08:30.970
- This ship goes to Cherbourg, France.
- Thank you ever so. See?

08:31.179 --> 08:34.557
What's all the talent in the blue jackets?
A band?

08:34.640 --> 08:38.311
That's the Olympic team.
They're sailing on this ship.

08:38.686 --> 08:43.649
The Olympic team, for me?
Wasn't that thoughtful of somebody?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.485
- Dibs on the shot-putter.
- Dorothy Shaw!

08:46.777 --> 08:50.489
Remember, you're the chaperone.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.200
Let's get this straight.

08:52.283 --> 08:55.453
The chaperone sees that
nobody else has fun.

08:55.703 --> 09:00.458
Nobody chaperones the chaperone.
That's why I'm right for this job.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.542
Passports, please.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.548
I thought you'd be late. Here's your ticket.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.884
They're at the passport desk.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.886
You're after the blonde.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.721
The brunette's her friend.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.890
We don't care what she does.

09:15.973 --> 09:19.685
- I care.
- Have fun, son.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.065
Come on, guys. Let's get on board.

09:24.148 --> 09:25.775
Have a nice trip.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.039
Suppose the ship sank.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.999
Which one would you save from drowning?

09:42.083 --> 09:44.168
Those girls couldn't drown.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.218
- Right in here, mademoiselle.
- Thank you.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.182
My, it's just like a room, isn't it?

09:59.725 --> 10:03.020
Oh, look! Round windows!

10:03.354 --> 10:07.275
Yes, dear. Just put that there, Frisbee.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.361
And, Frisbee, wait for me on the pier.

10:10.695 --> 10:11.696
Lorelei...

10:11.779 --> 10:13.698
- Where's Dorothy?
- I don't know.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.033
Someone whistled and she disappeared.

10:16.117 --> 10:18.703
Will she be a bad influence?

10:18.786 --> 10:23.916
Dorothy's not bad, honest.
She's just dumb.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.211
Always falling for a man
just because he's good-looking.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.088
- Oh dear, that's not...
- I keep telling her,

10:29.422 --> 10:32.466
it's as easy to fall for
a rich man as a poor man.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.385
But she says "Yes, but..."

10:34.760 --> 10:38.764
If they're tall, dark and handsome
she forgets vital statistics,

10:38.848 --> 10:39.849
until it's too late.

10:40.391 --> 10:42.435
That's why I'm her friend.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.979
She needs me to educate her.

10:45.062 --> 10:49.984
Yes, but very few girls have
your wonderful willingness to learn.

10:50.234 --> 10:54.405
- I suppose that's true.
- Put this in a safe place.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.907
- What is it?
- A letter of credit.

10:57.074 --> 11:00.619
That's sweet!
You wrote me before I went away.

11:00.828 --> 11:04.332
No, a letter of credit is like money.

11:04.415 --> 11:05.374
Money?

11:05.458 --> 11:08.252
Just take it to a bank in Paris.

11:08.336 --> 11:09.962
That's wonderful!

11:10.171 --> 11:13.758
Write me every day. I'll be so lonesome.

11:14.091 --> 11:17.178
I bought you a little going-away present.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.097
Daddy! Daddy:

11:20.765 --> 11:24.352
There's only one of you
in the whole wide world.

11:27.021 --> 11:29.774
Sorry, wrong room.

11:31.609 --> 11:34.695
- Who's that?
- A stranger. He had the wrong room.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.531
Good-looking.
Hope he isn't just seeing someone off.

11:37.615 --> 11:40.701
Quite a place we have here.

11:40.785 --> 11:44.080
Come in, fellas. Folks, meet the relay team.

11:44.163 --> 11:46.290
- Hi.
- How do you do?

11:46.374 --> 11:48.584
We're having a bon voyage party.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.586
Put the phonograph in there.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.506
Come on in, everybody.

11:53.589 --> 11:56.133
Make yourselves at home.
I'll get the glasses.

11:58.386 --> 12:00.346
Who's got the champagne?

12:02.223 --> 12:05.601
Keep those athletes to yourself.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.813
What a coincidence! That's my plan, too.

12:10.231 --> 12:13.776
Gangway! Who needs a glass?

12:14.068 --> 12:17.905
- I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

12:19.073 --> 12:21.200
I want to tell you...

12:22.535 --> 12:26.038
I want to remind you of something very...

12:26.580 --> 12:29.917
Stop that, please. It's most distracting

12:30.835 --> 12:35.047
Dear, a lot depends on how
you conduct yourself on this trip.

12:36.173 --> 12:40.010
As you know, Dad is dead set
against our marriage.

12:40.177 --> 12:44.098
Even the slightest hint of scandal...

12:44.390 --> 12:46.267
I don't know what I could do.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.645
My goodness, lover.
You don't have to tell me that.

12:50.104 --> 12:53.399
L'd give anything to sail with you, baby.

12:53.607 --> 12:57.111
Me too.
I don't know what I'll do without you.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.156
I don't know what I'll do without you.

13:01.198 --> 13:05.703
I’m not so sure.
You can be a naughty boy sometimes.

13:05.870 --> 13:08.747
You don't have to worry about me.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.500
I do, though.

13:18.757 --> 13:23.262
All visitors ashore! First call.
All visitors ashore!

13:23.554 --> 13:25.473
Bye-bye, baby

13:25.723 --> 13:31.812
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye

13:32.062 --> 13:37.776
Although I know that you care
Won’t you write and declare

13:37.985 --> 13:44.575
That though on the loose
You are still on the square?

13:44.742 --> 13:49.121
I'll be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me

13:49.413 --> 13:53.918
Then my shadows will fly

13:54.126 --> 13:57.755
Though you'll be gone for a while

13:57.963 --> 14:04.970
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

14:05.179 --> 14:11.268
- With my baby by and by
- In the sweet by and by

14:11.477 --> 14:13.687
Bye-bye, baby, bye-Dye

14:13.938 --> 14:18.776
- We’II go meet on the beautiful shore
- Baby, bye, goodbye

14:21.111 --> 14:23.155
Bye-bye, pretty baby

14:23.447 --> 14:26.700
You better remember you're my baby

14:26.951 --> 14:30.871
When they give you the eye
My, my!

14:31.121 --> 14:36.460
Although I know that you care
Won’t you write and declare

14:36.669 --> 14:43.175
Declare that though on the loose
You are still staying on the square

14:43.467 --> 14:46.053
I'll be gloomy

14:46.303 --> 14:48.806
But send that rainbow to me

14:49.014 --> 14:52.810
Then my shadow will fly

14:53.018 --> 14:56.981
Though you'll be gone for a while

14:57.189 --> 15:04.154
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

15:04.697 --> 15:09.827
With my baby by and by

15:23.340 --> 15:29.054
I'll be in my room alone

15:29.346 --> 15:34.059
Every postmeridian

15:34.351 --> 15:38.397
And I’Il be With my diary

15:38.689 --> 15:45.279
And that book by Mr. Gideon

15:46.697 --> 15:52.077
Bye-bye, baby

15:52.369 --> 15:58.250
Remember you're my baby

15:58.542 --> 16:05.466
When they give you the eye

16:06.800 --> 16:13.057
And just to show that I care

16:13.307 --> 16:19.313
I will write and declare

16:19.563 --> 16:24.943
That I'm on the loose

16:25.235 --> 16:31.158
But I’II stay on the square

16:32.242 --> 16:37.665
I'll be lonely

16:37.915 --> 16:43.921
But even though I'm lonely

16:44.254 --> 16:51.011
There’II be no other guy

16:53.263 --> 17:00.270
Though I'll be gone for a while

17:00.938 --> 17:06.859
I know that I'll be smilin'

17:07.819 --> 17:12.449
With my baby by and by and by

17:12.657 --> 17:15.993
With my baby by and by

17:16.286 --> 17:21.666
I'll be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me

17:23.167 --> 17:28.132
All ashore! Last call!
All ashore! Last call!

17:30.217 --> 17:37.182
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by and by

17:40.728 --> 17:46.859
Bye-bye, baby
Remember you're my baby

17:47.025 --> 17:50.904
When they give you the eye

17:50.988 --> 17:57.035
Although I know that you care
Won’t you write and declare

17:57.411 --> 18:03.417
That though on the loose
You are still on the square

18:12.009 --> 18:14.386
- You better go.
- Don't go.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.848
- Step back, please.
- Bye, lover!

18:18.015 --> 18:24.938
I know that I'll be smilin'
With my baby by and by

18:25.355 --> 18:27.399
And by

18:27.566 --> 18:32.237
With my wonderful baby

18:32.905 --> 18:39.870
By and by

18:55.427 --> 18:57.763
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:00.057 --> 19:01.934
Hi, Miss Shaw.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.228
All right, you guys, keep moving.

19:06.438 --> 19:11.693
-"Mr. Amos Jones and valet."
- What are you doing?

19:12.653 --> 19:17.908
Checking the passenger list.
"Mr. Alfred Loman and valet."

19:18.075 --> 19:21.119
"Mr. Eugene Martin and valet."

19:21.411 --> 19:24.248
Why the sudden interest in valets?

19:24.414 --> 19:29.253
When a man has "and valet"
after his name, he's worthwhile.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.422
I’m trying to find
a gentleman escort for you.

19:32.673 --> 19:37.302
Don't bother.
I just provided myself with about 20.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.849
Dorothy, did you ever hear
of a rich pole-vaulter?

19:42.099 --> 19:47.104
Who cares?
I like a man who can run faster than I can.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.523
I hate to think where you'll wind up.

19:49.773 --> 19:53.443
You're wasting time on
unrefined persons without money.

19:53.610 --> 19:57.489
Did it occur to you that
some people don't care about money?

19:57.781 --> 20:00.576
Don't be silly. We're talking serious.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.370
Do you want a loveless marriage?

20:03.453 --> 20:05.330
Me, loveless?

20:05.622 --> 20:10.419
If a girl spends time worrying
about the money she doesn't have,

20:10.502 --> 20:13.338
how will she have any time for love?

20:13.463 --> 20:17.301
I want you to find happiness
and stop having fun.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.970
That baffles me.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.180
You'll thank me some day.

20:22.806 --> 20:27.269
Here's a good one.
Henry Spofford III and valet

20:28.520 --> 20:33.191
I remember. The Spofford family
owns practically a whole state.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.737
A big one too. I think it's Pennsylvania.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.656
I guess I could settle for Pennsylvania.

20:40.198 --> 20:45.329
- Hello, Mrs. Henry Spofford III.
- Mrs. Henry Spofford III and valet

20:45.454 --> 20:48.916
He won't have anything I don't.
See you later.

20:48.999 --> 20:52.169
Don't forget the cocktail party. 5:30.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.511
- The whole team?
- Until after the Games.

21:01.845 --> 21:04.848
You eat at 6:00 and go to bed at 9:00?

21:04.932 --> 21:05.933
That's right.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.768
Coach is strict.

21:07.851 --> 21:12.522
Holy smoke, 9:00!
That's just when life begins.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.691
- Not for us.
- All right, you guys.

21:23.033 --> 21:28.538
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

21:28.914 --> 21:31.416
One, two, three, four.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.586
One, two, three, four.

21:34.795 --> 21:37.547
One, two, three, four.

21:37.798 --> 21:46.556
One, two, three, four.

21:46.974 --> 21:49.434
One, two, three, four.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.653
Honey, you'll hurt yourself.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.493
I can't play tennis
My golf's a menace

22:06.743 --> 22:09.830
I just can't do the Australian crawl

22:10.080 --> 22:14.751
And I'm no better at Volleyball
Ain't there anyone here for love?

22:15.002 --> 22:19.840
Sweet love
Ain't there anyone here for love?

22:29.433 --> 22:34.771
I'm apathetic and non-athletic
Can't keep up in a marathon

22:34.980 --> 22:41.945
I need some shoulder to lean upon
And a couple of arms to hold me

22:42.154 --> 22:45.699
Ain't there anyone here for love?

22:55.292 --> 23:02.299
I'm not in condition to wrestle

23:02.632 --> 23:06.803
I've never trained in a gym

23:08.638 --> 23:13.518
Show me a man who can nestle

23:13.727 --> 23:18.231
And I'll pin a medal on him

23:19.566 --> 23:24.154
Need some chappie to make me happy
And he don't have to be Hercules

23:24.362 --> 23:29.326
Don't anyone know about birds and bees?
Ain't there anyone here for love?

23:30.077 --> 23:34.331
Sweet love

23:34.498 --> 23:38.502
Ain't there anyone...

23:38.710 --> 23:42.839
...here for love?

23:49.012 --> 23:51.848
Doubles, anyone?

23:57.604 --> 23:59.940
Court's free.

24:04.736 --> 24:08.698
Two out of three, anyone?

24:14.371 --> 24:16.832
Doesn't anyone want to play?

24:18.583 --> 24:23.755
I like big muscles
And red corpuscles

24:24.047 --> 24:27.884
I like a beautiful hunk of man

24:28.135 --> 24:32.305
But I’m no physical culture fan

24:32.556 --> 24:36.726
Ain't there anyone here for love?

24:36.935 --> 24:41.565
Sweet love
Ain't there anyone

24:43.900 --> 24:46.069
Ain't there anyone

24:48.488 --> 24:54.786
Ain't there anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone

24:59.124 --> 25:02.169
For love?

25:12.304 --> 25:14.931
- Did you say $50?
- Oui.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.809
A tidy sum just to sit at a table.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.562
Supply and demand. Many requests
for a seat at Miss Shaw's table.

25:20.645 --> 25:23.815
I got many requests for a seat at
Miss Lee and Miss Shaw's table.

25:24.024 --> 25:30.238
And the price goes up and up and up.
That's inevitable. Je regrette.

25:31.615 --> 25:37.120
Je regrette it more than vous.
However, the name's Malone.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.164
Get it down while I can still afford it.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.248
Merci, Monsieur Malone.

25:41.750 --> 25:44.794
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Are you the headwaiter?

25:44.878 --> 25:47.714
- At your service.
-I'm Miss Lee.

25:47.964 --> 25:53.470
Miss Lee. Well, now I understand.
What can I do for you?

25:53.678 --> 25:56.556
Put a certain gentleman at my table.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.851
There's nothing I can do for you.

26:00.060 --> 26:03.480
All seating arrangements
are completed, final.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.232
That's too bad.

26:05.315 --> 26:09.444
In Atlantic City, all the men
at my hotel wanted to sit at my table.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.863
I can understand that.

26:11.947 --> 26:14.950
Some even gave the headwaiter money.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.828
That happens. What can one do?
One takes it.

26:19.037 --> 26:23.375
- That headwaiter had to give it back.
- Indeed? Why?

26:23.583 --> 26:29.089
I had all my meals in my room.
I didn't come to the table at all.

26:29.339 --> 26:32.509
Naturally, the men wanted their money.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.261
I beg you...

26:34.344 --> 26:36.596
Do you want me to eat in my room?

26:36.846 --> 26:38.848
That must not be.

26:38.932 --> 26:43.228
If Mr. Henry Spofford III
is seated at my table...

26:43.603 --> 26:47.607
- It shall be.
- Thank you ever so

26:58.743 --> 27:02.872
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss Shaw. Nice to see you.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.916
My name is Watson.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.336
Here we are, all ready for you.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.880
- I need it.
- What's the matter?

27:11.214 --> 27:14.968
The entire Olympic team
has to be in bed by 9:00.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.387
What can you do?

27:17.554 --> 27:21.224
- Write your congressman.
- Catch me a pigeon, and I will

27:21.433 --> 27:26.938
May I present Sir Francis Beekman?
A pigeon, if there ever was one.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.732
Note the ruby eyes.

27:28.898 --> 27:33.737
No reason to run me down.
Jealous. I have a way with ladies

27:33.987 --> 27:39.576
It's that diamond mine of yours.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

27:39.784 --> 27:44.998
Cheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
What say we sit down?

27:45.248 --> 27:48.960
I understand you're an entertainer.
I'll bet you're good.

27:49.252 --> 27:52.505
Thanks. Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?

27:52.756 --> 27:55.925
I do. Are you interested in diamonds?

27:56.092 --> 28:00.597
- Not particularly.
- You must be an extraordinary girl.

28:00.764 --> 28:04.100
- Will you do me a favor, sir?
- Call me Piggie.

28:04.309 --> 28:07.103
- Do me a favor, Piggie?
- Anything.

28:07.312 --> 28:12.859
Don't spread it around about your mine.
I don't want my friend to hear.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.944
She doesn't care for diamonds?

28:15.111 --> 28:20.283
I'm trying to avoid trouble.
Do not tell her about the diamonds.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.452
Did you say "diamonds"?

28:22.660 --> 28:26.498
Well, well, well! By George, I must say!

28:26.790 --> 28:31.294
No doubt about it, no sirree.
No doubt about it at all.

28:31.461 --> 28:36.299
- Miss Lee, meet Piggie.
- Delighted! Delighted!

28:39.302 --> 28:42.347
You did say "diamonds." I can tell.

28:42.555 --> 28:46.976
I control the second largest mine
in South Africa.

28:47.185 --> 28:52.482
But this lady has a friend
she doesn't want to know about me.

28:52.649 --> 28:55.902
- I wonder why.
- Oh, no, you don't.

28:56.152 --> 29:01.825
Having heard so much about you,
I expected you'd be much older.

29:02.033 --> 29:07.497
Me? You don't say. By George!
Older than what?

29:07.705 --> 29:09.165
The Pyramids.

29:09.374 --> 29:13.837
I say if a man isn't a certain age,
he isn't interesting.

29:14.087 --> 29:16.172
Honey, lay off!

29:16.339 --> 29:18.758
Bless my soul. Care to dance?

29:19.008 --> 29:23.721
I'd enjoy to dance. Thank you ever so.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.268
- Another drink?
- No, thanks.

29:28.518 --> 29:34.065
- Need a program to tell the players.
- I want to know who the players are.

29:34.357 --> 29:39.446
- Like, who just stole second base?
- My name's Malone.

29:39.696 --> 29:44.075
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy. Well, Mr. Malone?

29:44.367 --> 29:48.037
You're the most attractive girl here,
so I came over.

29:48.288 --> 29:54.711
- Flattery will get you anywhere.
- Then we haven't any problems.

29:54.919 --> 29:58.131
I was wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.

29:58.423 --> 30:03.636
- I had some business to attend to.
- Then this isn't a vacation?

30:03.887 --> 30:06.723
Not entirely. There's still a telephone.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.726
- In fact, I just had some bad news.
- Oh?

30:09.934 --> 30:15.482
My best 2-year-old will never run again.
He's worth $40,000.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.818
It's not the money.
This might've been good.

30:19.068 --> 30:22.280
- You're not one of those?
- One of what?

30:22.489 --> 30:25.617
The kind who tells a girl about his money.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.911
What's wrong with money?

30:28.077 --> 30:32.457
Yes, I'm afraid you are.
Go whistle up a rope.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.000
Wait...

30:34.250 --> 30:37.629
I can't stand rich playboys who think they...

30:37.837 --> 30:43.092
Now wait a minute! I'm not that bad
all the time. Sometimes I'm very nice.

30:43.301 --> 30:45.970
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

30:46.179 --> 30:48.932
So you're half sweet, half acid.

30:49.140 --> 30:52.477
- Please, I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

30:52.769 --> 30:57.440
I got some bad information.
Now that I've put my foot in it...

30:57.649 --> 31:02.153
I remember it wasn't you they were
talking about, but your friend.

31:02.362 --> 31:05.615
- Lorelei.
- Or am I wrong again?

31:05.823 --> 31:09.786
No, money is rather a hobby of Lorelei's.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.289
Oh, Piggie.

31:13.456 --> 31:18.294
- You're worried about her.
- You're very observing.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.380
Am I forgiven?

31:20.838 --> 31:23.633
Considering the man shortage
on this craft...

31:23.800 --> 31:27.470
Good. We'll start all over again.
I promise that I...

31:27.679 --> 31:29.138
We're gonna be interrupted.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.182
We had a jolly time.

31:31.391 --> 31:37.188
- Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggie.
- How do you do?

31:37.397 --> 31:43.236
Piggie is the super-best dancer.
So light on his feet.

31:43.486 --> 31:47.532
- I was sure he would be.
- You're trying to flatter me.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.493
- What's the matter?
- My Wife.

31:50.702 --> 31:54.539
- I thought it was his mine.
- Won't you join us?

31:54.747 --> 31:58.251
- I just have.
- May I present Miss Lee?

31:58.501 --> 32:01.754
- Miss Shaw, Mr...
- Malone.

32:02.005 --> 32:06.384
- A pleasure, I'm ever so sure.
- Thank you.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.429
We're having a jolly time.

32:09.679 --> 32:14.684
Lady Beekman, that's the most
beautiful jewelry I've ever seen.

32:15.893 --> 32:21.107
I'm proud of the earrings. Heirlooms.
Been in the family for ages.

32:21.357 --> 32:25.028
You'd never Know it.
They look just like new

32:26.029 --> 32:31.034
You might be interested in my tiara.
I always have it with me.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.536
Afraid to leave it in my room.

32:33.703 --> 32:39.626
- But not afraid to show it to Lorelei?
- Stop. She won't know you're teasing.

32:40.793 --> 32:45.632
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?

32:45.882 --> 32:49.427
All blue stones. Cozy little job, what?

32:49.719 --> 32:53.139
- May I just hold it for a minute?
- Of course.

32:55.224 --> 32:59.145
- How do you put it on?
- It goes on your head.

32:59.395 --> 33:05.401
- You must think I was born yesterday.
- There's no other explanation.

33:05.652 --> 33:10.907
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. It's a tiara.

33:11.074 --> 33:17.413
You do wear it on your head! I love
finding new places to wear diamonds.

33:17.622 --> 33:21.751
Excuse me, dear.
Miss Lee has promised me this dance.

33:21.918 --> 33:25.254
We've got to dress for dinner. We must go.

33:25.463 --> 33:28.132
Well, all right. Au revoir.

33:28.341 --> 33:31.594
A very pleasant au revoir to you.

33:32.428 --> 33:35.431
My tiara. Thank you.

33:36.599 --> 33:40.603
Poor fella.
Two-to-one she locks him in her closet.

33:40.812 --> 33:44.774
-I'd be grateful if she did.
- I think he's cute.

33:44.982 --> 33:50.780
You know very well what I mean.
You and that... What are you doing?

33:51.030 --> 33:56.619
Just testing. Wonder what I'll wear it with.
How does it look?

33:56.786 --> 33:59.706
Exactly like trouble.

34:06.337 --> 34:11.634
I told the coalition leader that we
need a man who can do something about...

34:15.012 --> 34:17.806
Finish your story, dear.

34:37.994 --> 34:39.495
Your table, madame.

34:39.704 --> 34:45.668
Good evening, Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Crossley. Mr. Franklin.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.172
- Mr. Mason. How do you do?
- Mr. Brooks.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.380
How do you do?

34:50.590 --> 34:54.177
- Is Mr. Spofford here?
- No, but this is his chair.

34:54.427 --> 34:58.556
- You're here, Miss Lee.
- Miss Shaw, you're here.

34:58.765 --> 35:03.436
- Could my friend have your seat?
- But of course.

35:03.686 --> 35:06.022
She gets sick if she rides backwards.

35:06.189 --> 35:09.192
-I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

35:12.028 --> 35:16.449
- How are we at the same table?
- I was assigned this seat.

35:16.699 --> 35:21.078
- How much did it cost?
- I can't tell. You'd get conceited.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.706
Enjoying the trip, Mr. Franklin?

35:23.915 --> 35:28.294
How many times have you crossed?
Isn't it lonely on the ocean?

35:28.544 --> 35:31.798
I just adore conversation, don't you?

35:32.048 --> 35:35.802
Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.

35:36.052 --> 35:40.431
Dorothy. Pardon me for whispering.
Try to make a good impression.

35:40.598 --> 35:41.766
Okay.

35:41.933 --> 35:46.729
Right this way, sir. Mr. Henry Spofford.

35:47.647 --> 35:49.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.734
Hello. Hello.

35:51.901 --> 35:55.238
Well, are you traveling by yourself?

35:55.446 --> 35:58.574
No, I've got a valet, a tutor and a trainer.

35:58.825 --> 36:05.456
Well, having heard so much about you,
I expected you to be much older.

36:05.665 --> 36:09.836
I'm old enough to appreciate
a good-looking girl.

36:10.086 --> 36:13.422
This promises to be quite a trip.

36:13.673 --> 36:16.133
Personally, I don't intend to miss a meal.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.637
How am I doing?

36:26.435 --> 36:31.107
- There's a place.
- Ernie, will you get some cigarettes?

36:35.945 --> 36:40.324
I can't get over that passenger list.
Calling a young boy "mister."

36:40.533 --> 36:43.995
A girl could Waste a whole trip to Europe.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.455
Think we better give up the idea?

36:46.706 --> 36:50.293
If he were 16,
you could marry him in Tennessee.

36:50.459 --> 36:55.006
- Drinks seemed like a good idea.
- You're a dear boy.

36:55.214 --> 36:59.385
- What's your line, Mr. Malone?
- My line?

36:59.635 --> 37:04.515
I tell a girl she has hair
like a tortured midnight,

37:04.807 --> 37:08.019
lips like a red couch in an ivory palace,

37:08.227 --> 37:13.482
and I'm lonely.
Then I generally burst into tears.

37:13.691 --> 37:16.569
- Very seldom works.
- You idiot.

37:16.819 --> 37:21.198
- What do you do for a living?
- Oh, that kind of line.

37:21.407 --> 37:25.411
Nothing, I'm afraid. Just clip coupons.

37:25.745 --> 37:30.166
- Coupons. That's like money, isn't it?
- Very similar.

37:30.333 --> 37:35.504
I'm so pleased. Dorothy's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.

37:35.671 --> 37:36.839
No taste?

37:37.048 --> 37:40.009
No, I'm a hobo collector.
I might find room for you.

37:40.176 --> 37:43.888
- She's joking.
- I hope not, I'm counting on it.

37:44.180 --> 37:47.892
- Some people don't get her jokes
- I'm gonna try.

37:48.100 --> 37:52.772
Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend
a girl ever had.

37:53.022 --> 37:57.401
She'll make a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.

37:57.610 --> 38:00.738
-I've got to be going.
- Going? Where?

38:00.947 --> 38:04.784
Don't worry.
I'm only concerned about you two.

38:05.034 --> 38:07.620
There's a wonderful moon out.

38:07.870 --> 38:12.583
There you are.
Miss Lee, will you dance with me?

38:12.875 --> 38:16.879
I'd love to. If you hadn't asked me,
I was going to ask you.

38:17.088 --> 38:21.634
Really? Well, by Jove!
I say, will you excuse us?

38:28.140 --> 38:31.394
- Do you remember last night?
- Very well.

38:31.602 --> 38:35.314
I mean when we were talking
about the moon.

38:35.564 --> 38:39.068
It reminded you of a moon in Coney Island.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.821
Could have been the same one. Why?

38:42.071 --> 38:44.240
I remember I was wondering

38:44.407 --> 38:48.327
what a rich man like you
were doing in Coney Island.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.578
Oh, well...

38:49.745 --> 38:54.583
I rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.806
Wonder if I should break that up.

39:09.015 --> 39:14.020
They're just dancing in public.
Can't make much of a case of that.

39:14.270 --> 39:16.480
You sound like a detective.

39:16.689 --> 39:21.277
Let's go find our moon
and forget about your girlfriend.

39:21.485 --> 39:24.488
I'd get in trouble
if I pushed Piggie overboard

39:24.780 --> 39:26.615
Not with me.

39:26.824 --> 39:30.286
Why blame Piggie? It's not all his fault.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.621
No, I...

39:32.955 --> 39:36.000
Just what did you mean by that remark?

39:36.208 --> 39:41.797
I can't figure out how two girls can
be so different and be friends.

39:42.006 --> 39:47.303
Let's get this straight.
Nobody talks about Lorelei but me.

39:47.470 --> 39:51.140
She's quite a girl. You just don't know her.

39:54.143 --> 39:58.230
You don't mind if I like you better, do you?

40:01.317 --> 40:06.363
- We settled that quarrel in a hurry.
- Now what do we talk about?

40:06.655 --> 40:08.324
Let's talk about you.

40:09.408 --> 40:13.204
For the past hour I've been thinking.

40:13.996 --> 40:16.290
Thinking about doing something.

40:17.208 --> 40:20.336
What have you been thinking, Mr. Malone?

40:59.834 --> 41:00.876
Aren't you clever!

41:01.210 --> 41:06.298
That means, "Come to my basha.
I'll give you coconut shells."

41:06.549 --> 41:11.095
The natives believe
coconut shells Ward off the snakes.

41:11.303 --> 41:13.722
Africa must be fascinating.

41:13.931 --> 41:19.270
A girl like I almost never gets
to meet a really interesting man.

41:19.478 --> 41:23.566
- Sometimes my brain gets starved.
- Poor little thing.

41:23.899 --> 41:28.612
It's a terrible thing to be lonesome,
especially in the middle of a crowd.

41:28.904 --> 41:30.281
Do you know what I mean?

41:30.489 --> 41:32.908
You'll never be lonesome again.
Leave it to Piggie.

41:34.743 --> 41:39.748
-I've got to see Lorelei alone.
- Shall I wait in the next room?

41:39.915 --> 41:43.919
If you like.
We're expecting Lady Beekman for tea.

41:44.128 --> 41:47.506
Here? I just remembered,
I have another appointment.

41:47.756 --> 41:52.469
I better pop off.
Toodle-oo, chin-chin and all that rot.

41:53.596 --> 41:57.474
- That was mean!
- Shut up and listen to me.

41:57.766 --> 41:59.935
- You're in a jam.
- Me? Why?

42:00.144 --> 42:03.606
What were you doing before
Piggie started barking?

42:03.772 --> 42:08.027
- He wasn't barking, that's Swahili.
- Before that.

42:08.277 --> 42:13.157
Were you doing anything you
wouldn't want Mr. Esmond to see?

42:13.365 --> 42:18.495
- Why, no... My goodness, yes!
- What?

42:18.704 --> 42:23.292
He was telling me about South Africa.
It's dangerous.

42:23.500 --> 42:30.466
Full of snakes called pythons.
It seems a python can grab a goat

42:30.633 --> 42:34.303
and kill it by squeezing it to death.

42:34.511 --> 42:37.223
- Get to the point.
- That's all.

42:37.473 --> 42:40.309
What's incriminating about that?

42:40.476 --> 42:45.064
Well, Piggie was being the python,
and I was a goat.

42:45.314 --> 42:46.982
Oh, Lorelei!

42:47.191 --> 42:50.736
Don't worry! Piggie won't tell anyone!

42:51.320 --> 42:55.866
He won't have to.
When Piggie was squeezing the goat,

42:56.075 --> 43:00.496
Mr. Malone was taking pictures
through that porthole.

43:00.704 --> 43:05.668
- Whatever for?
- The National Geographic Magazine.

43:05.876 --> 43:10.214
Wake up, honey. Mr. Malone has foxed us.

43:10.422 --> 43:13.592
He's been shining up to me to watch you.

43:13.842 --> 43:17.388
I'll bet you anything he's a private
detective hired by Mr. Esmond.

43:19.765 --> 43:24.895
Gus is jealous without pictures. He sees
that, he'll be absolutely unreasonable.

43:25.187 --> 43:27.606
Yes, he will.

43:28.941 --> 43:31.777
I was gonna kill him, but I thought better.

43:32.027 --> 43:33.696
Better?

43:33.862 --> 43:37.157
We'll get the photos
if he doesn't know we know.

43:37.241 --> 43:39.952
-I'll get them. He's a man, isn't he?
- How?

43:40.286 --> 43:43.747
Charm won't work. He's too smart for that.

43:44.623 --> 43:48.335
- And he was such a doll last night.
- Oh, Dorothy!

43:49.295 --> 43:53.048
Boy, will I tell him off
once we get the pictures!

43:53.215 --> 43:57.261
- The question is, how do we do that?
- Well...

43:57.886 --> 44:03.434
The simplest way is to swipe them.
We'll get our war paint on and go to work.

44:43.599 --> 44:47.936
- Where's Lorelei tonight?
- You sound interested.

44:48.103 --> 44:50.272
I am, but not in her.

44:51.482 --> 44:55.778
If you are interested,
I know where we could find her.

44:56.695 --> 44:58.364
Just asking a question.

45:19.802 --> 45:21.136
That's all.

45:49.581 --> 45:50.833
Hello.

45:50.999 --> 45:55.838
Mr. Spofford, please give me a hand.
I'm sort of stuck.

45:55.921 --> 45:58.799
- Are you a burglar?
- Heavens, no!

45:59.174 --> 46:01.844
I got looked in. I was waiting for a friend.

46:01.969 --> 46:06.432
- Why didn't you ring for him?
- I didn't think of it.

46:06.723 --> 46:12.271
- If you're a burglar and I help you...
- Please, help before someone comes

46:12.521 --> 46:17.568
I'm thinking. All right.
I'll help you for two reasons.

46:17.860 --> 46:19.319
Never mind the reasons.

46:20.195 --> 46:23.782
The first is, I'm too young to be sent to jail.

46:24.032 --> 46:28.454
The second is, you've got
a lot of animal magnetism.

46:31.206 --> 46:34.418
Look, someone's coming.

46:36.879 --> 46:42.384
- What'll I do?
- Hold this around your neck, tight.

46:50.058 --> 46:51.268
Good evening.

46:51.477 --> 46:55.731
I say, whatever are you doing up there?

46:55.981 --> 46:58.650
I wanted to see the view from here.

46:58.901 --> 47:02.237
Are you feeling well, my dear?

47:02.446 --> 47:06.575
Yes, thank you ever so,
but I must have caught a chill.

47:06.825 --> 47:10.746
- What say we get a spot of sherry?
- I can't.

47:10.954 --> 47:15.000
- Sherry's the best thing for a cold.
- I couldn't.

47:15.292 --> 47:18.170
You do look flushed. Let me feel your pulse.

47:18.420 --> 47:20.255
No, no, please...

47:20.422 --> 47:24.760
No cause for alarm, my dear.
It's purely medical.

47:24.968 --> 47:29.515
- There's no fever, at any rate.
-I'm all right, I'm fine.

47:29.765 --> 47:32.434
- Such a little hand.
- Put that back.

47:32.643 --> 47:37.981
So sweet, so tiny,
and yet it can hold a human heart.

47:38.190 --> 47:40.526
- Stop that!
- Beg your pardon?

47:40.776 --> 47:43.820
Well I... Why...

47:43.987 --> 47:46.782
- Laryngitis, I guess.
- No doubt.

47:47.032 --> 47:52.162
- I need sherry. Will you get it?
- I fly on the Wings of Mercury.

47:52.371 --> 47:56.458
- Just hurry up.
- All right, my dear.

48:00.128 --> 48:05.008
How can you stand that old Wolf?
His intentions aren't honorable.

48:05.217 --> 48:08.887
For heaven's sakes, get me out of here!

48:14.643 --> 48:16.812
Help me over here.

48:18.021 --> 48:22.442
You're all bruised? Malone's been
here with me the whole time.

48:22.693 --> 48:29.116
- Mr. Spofford pulled me too hard.
- Never mind. Did you get the pictures?

48:29.366 --> 48:31.243
- They weren't there.
- Sure?

48:31.493 --> 48:35.914
I looked everywhere.
I even looked in the camera shop.

48:36.164 --> 48:40.586
- Then he's got them in his pockets.
- He must, darn it!

48:40.836 --> 48:45.007
He wouldn't hide them if
he thinks we're buying his act.

48:45.257 --> 48:50.512
Order dinner for three in our cabin
and get some drinks.

48:50.721 --> 48:52.931
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

48:53.181 --> 48:57.102
If we can't empty his pockets,
we're not worthy to be women.

48:57.352 --> 48:59.271
I'll have everything ready.

49:11.700 --> 49:15.370
He'll be here in a minute.
Are the drinks ready?

49:15.537 --> 49:17.122
Almost ready.

49:17.372 --> 49:21.043
This room's like an oven.
Let's turn the heat off.

49:21.209 --> 49:22.753
Leave it alone.

49:23.462 --> 49:25.714
But it's hot, why don't...

49:25.881 --> 49:30.469
Oh, for him. You know,
sometimes your brain amazes me.

49:30.719 --> 49:36.308
Thank you. Our drink is water and
bitters, so don't make any remarks.

49:36.558 --> 49:38.226
What are you doing?

49:38.435 --> 49:42.147
This is his. Are three sleeping pills enough?

49:42.397 --> 49:45.400
Three's a lot. That's potent stuff.

49:45.609 --> 49:48.654
If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

49:50.405 --> 49:52.407
Here we go.

49:55.285 --> 49:57.954
- Come in.
- Here are your cigarettes.

49:58.038 --> 50:01.875
- Hi, Miss Lee.
- I got cocktails all ready.

50:02.042 --> 50:06.755
- Make yourself at home.
- It's hot in here. Must be 110.

50:07.255 --> 50:09.841
She's afraid of catching cold.

50:10.092 --> 50:14.096
Touch of laryngitis.
Here, specialty of the house

50:14.304 --> 50:15.764
That's quite a cocktail.

50:15.847 --> 50:19.017
It's very mild. Let's drink a toast.
Do you know this one?

50:19.768 --> 50:23.980
There was a fellow named Sidney
Who drank till he ruined a kidney

50:24.314 --> 50:27.859
It shriveled and shrank
But he drank and he drank

50:28.110 --> 50:30.445
He had fun doing it, didn't he?

50:30.529 --> 50:34.700
- Appetizing.
- I know another. Bottoms up.

50:44.710 --> 50:46.795
He looks like he'll explode.

50:47.129 --> 50:52.676
- What are you made of? What was that?
- Scotch, vodka, brandy and gin.

50:52.843 --> 50:55.053
Here, try this.

51:00.684 --> 51:03.603
- That wasn't water!
- No, straight vodka.

51:03.687 --> 51:07.858
Want some more? What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

51:08.024 --> 51:11.361
-I'm burning up.
- Let's take off your coat.

51:11.862 --> 51:16.158
Yes, you'll feel better.
You'll cool off. I'll help.

51:16.366 --> 51:20.537
Now you just sit down there.
Excuse me a minute.

51:21.913 --> 51:25.333
- Any luck?
- Not so far.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.920
Be sure you check the inside pocket.

51:29.171 --> 51:33.175
- It's not in here.
- It's not in his coat.

51:33.383 --> 51:36.845
There's one other place
it could be: his pants.

51:37.012 --> 51:39.890
- We'll have to get them.
- Should I do it alone?

51:40.098 --> 51:43.268
- Two heads are better than one.
- I suppose so.

51:43.518 --> 51:47.105
It's ticklish business. We'll stick together.

51:48.356 --> 51:52.444
I nearly went to sleep.
Could you turn the heat down?

51:52.527 --> 51:55.947
- He needs a glass of water.
- Yes, indeed.

51:56.031 --> 51:58.533
I'd like water, but it's this heat...

51:58.742 --> 52:00.744
Nice glass of water.

52:00.952 --> 52:02.704
Look out!

52:03.914 --> 52:08.126
- Your pants are soaked!
- We can't leave him in wet pants.

52:08.376 --> 52:12.214
-I'll put them under the hair dryer.
-I'll go and change.

52:12.380 --> 52:15.884
- Don't be silly. You'll catch cold.
- No, no! Look...

52:16.092 --> 52:20.055
I won't catch cold!
What kind of a party is this?

52:23.266 --> 52:26.228
You're just in time.
Get something to put on him.

52:26.394 --> 52:30.732
Mr. Malone doesn't feel well.
You better go and lie down.

52:30.941 --> 52:36.071
- I feel like lying down for a month.
- Here, put this on.

52:36.655 --> 52:38.281
François'll help.

52:38.490 --> 52:43.745
It's not fair.
Two against one, take a man's pants...

52:49.751 --> 52:52.963
- I don't think it's here
- It must be.

52:55.006 --> 52:57.759
I've got it! I've got it!

52:58.927 --> 53:03.598
Here. $2.20.
Your negatives and positive prints.

53:03.765 --> 53:08.603
And may I say, in the words
of my countrymen, "Ooh, la, la!"

53:08.770 --> 53:11.273
- Thank you ever so.
- A pleasure.

53:11.481 --> 53:12.941
Hi. Remember me?

53:13.191 --> 53:16.111
Yes. You're one of the Olympic athletes.

53:16.319 --> 53:19.197
I'm the only 4-letter man on the team.

53:19.447 --> 53:24.452
You should be ashamed to admit it.
No, don't say another word.

53:26.621 --> 53:32.836
This is the most contemptible bit
of impudence I've ever encountered.

53:33.044 --> 53:38.842
Photographing innocent people!
It's invasion of privacy.

53:39.050 --> 53:44.848
If a newspaper got it, your wife
wouldn't know you were being a snake.

53:45.056 --> 53:50.312
I think I better sit down.
Are you sure there are no more?

53:50.562 --> 53:53.481
Positive, Piggie. Do you feel better?

53:53.648 --> 53:56.735
You little angel, you don't even know that

53:56.818 --> 54:00.697
a certain type of girl would
take advantage of this.

54:00.780 --> 54:04.075
She'd have to be a terrible girl to be mean

54:04.159 --> 54:07.996
to a sweet, intelligent,
generous man like you.

54:08.413 --> 54:12.667
My dear, let me do something
to show my gratitude.

54:13.001 --> 54:17.672
- Thank you ever so!
- May I kiss your hand?

54:17.881 --> 54:23.511
A kiss on the hand feels good,
but a diamond tiara lasts forever.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.514
- Tiara?
- Lady Beekman's. I'd love it.

54:26.723 --> 54:29.517
- Good gracious.
- What's the matter?

54:29.768 --> 54:34.606
Wouldn't you rather have
some furs or a race horse?

54:34.856 --> 54:35.857
No, thank you.

54:36.066 --> 54:40.779
It would be hard to explain
that I'd given it away.

54:41.029 --> 54:44.866
You're so clever.
You could, if you put your mind to it.

54:45.075 --> 54:47.619
- Do you think so?
- Of course.

54:47.869 --> 54:54.125
Besides, it's only fair I should have
her tiara. After all, she has you.

54:54.376 --> 54:57.212
MY dear, my very dear!

54:57.379 --> 55:02.050
- Let's get it now.
- Anything you say, my dear.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.191
- Keep an eye on the door.
- Oui, monsieur.

55:34.624 --> 55:38.670
All right, Pierre.
Take this thing back to my cabin.

55:38.920 --> 55:44.968
I'll stay here.
Here's the microphone and a dividend.

55:45.176 --> 55:47.262
Merci, monsieur.

55:48.430 --> 55:51.266
- And leave the door open.
- Oui, monsieur.

55:54.185 --> 55:58.189
Lorelei, they're coming...
How did you get in?

55:58.773 --> 56:02.444
- Through the door.
- Still snooping around?

56:02.652 --> 56:06.281
Nothing to do with you.
I'm paid to watch the blonde...

56:06.489 --> 56:08.992
I'd sure hate to have your job.

56:09.284 --> 56:14.831
Checking up on people is messy work,
but only when they're doing things...

56:15.123 --> 56:19.044
Like pretending to make love to a girl
while you spy on her friend?

56:19.127 --> 56:21.963
That part of it is not true.

56:22.130 --> 56:28.136
I don't believe anything you say.
Go away, Sherlock, you're a wrong guy.

56:28.511 --> 56:32.557
-I'm not wrong about you.
- You're only making it Worse.

56:32.807 --> 56:35.477
Don't listen, but I'm telling you...

56:35.727 --> 56:39.647
Come on in, you can hear better in here.

56:40.106 --> 56:43.276
Am I intruding, or is he leaving?

56:43.735 --> 56:49.199
I'm leaving.
But, Miss Lee, before I go, I'll tell you this.

56:49.407 --> 56:54.162
Sometimes even a mercenary nitwit
like you has a decent impulse.

56:54.370 --> 56:57.665
Don't get your friend mixed up
in your schemes.

56:57.749 --> 57:03.213
Because I'll rub your nose in them,
and I don't want her to get hurt.

57:03.505 --> 57:07.050
If you've nothing more to say, pray, scat!

57:07.342 --> 57:09.719
That's about all.

57:09.844 --> 57:14.808
Honey, except for telling you
I have money, which I haven't,

57:15.016 --> 57:20.647
everything else I said, I meant.
And it wasn't part of my job either

57:23.566 --> 57:25.735
Think about it.

57:29.948 --> 57:32.283
Why did you just stand there
and let him kiss you?

57:33.952 --> 57:38.706
It's crazy, but I think
I'm falling in love with that slob.

57:39.374 --> 57:42.168
You just feel that way because he's poor.

57:42.669 --> 57:46.089
I hope so. Come on, let's change.
We dock in an hour.

58:20.123 --> 58:22.500
We want to buy some clothes.
You know, hats, dresses.

58:25.253 --> 58:26.629
You know some good places?

58:28.756 --> 58:30.383
That's where we want to go first.

58:53.948 --> 58:56.242
- This has been fun, hasn't it?
- Yes.

58:56.326 --> 58:59.162
It's the first time
I've shopped without a man along.

59:05.752 --> 59:10.965
You were a big help.
I've never spent so much money so fast.

59:11.049 --> 59:13.218
- A pleasure.
- Is that enough?

59:13.468 --> 59:15.970
- Thank you.
- We'll be seeing you.

59:27.815 --> 59:28.858
Bonjour, madame.

59:29.025 --> 59:32.487
Bonjour. I am the manager. May I help you?

59:32.570 --> 59:36.157
Certainly. Show me a place
to take my shoes off.

59:36.366 --> 59:39.494
Dorothy, a lady never admits her feet hurt.

59:40.370 --> 59:42.997
Have you reservations?

59:43.164 --> 59:46.376
Yes. In the name of Mr. Augustus Esmond.

59:46.459 --> 59:48.795
- This is Miss Shaw, I'm Miss Lee.
- Hi.

59:49.128 --> 59:54.509
Oh, yes. We have been expecting you.
This way, please.

59:59.097 --> 01:00:03.726
- Well!
- I thought we'd lose you in Paris.

01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:08.022
- Are these the persons you spoke of?
- Yes.

01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:12.235
Lady Piggie. I mean Beekman!
What a pleasant surprise.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.740
I dare say. You may proceed, Pritchard.
This person is Miss Lee.

01:00:18.241 --> 01:00:21.953
I represent the Suffolk Insurance Company.

01:00:22.537 --> 01:00:24.247
I never buy insurance.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:28.960
Mr. Malone needs it in his business.
What is all this?

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:33.756
If you return the tiara, I'm willing
to forget this squalid incident.

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:40.888
Allow me to clarify. Lady Beekman's
tiara has been reported as stolen.

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:46.311
- What's that got to do with us?
- It's in your possession.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:49.731
- Absolutely not!
- Let Lorelei talk for herself.

01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:55.695
She'll do better than that.
She'll sue you for slender! Tell them

01:00:55.987 --> 01:00:58.614
- We're waiting.
- None of your business.

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:00.742
It's very much our business.

01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:06.247
Just tell them you haven't got it...
Oh, Lorelei, you didn't!

01:01:06.331 --> 01:01:08.416
I did not steal the tiara.

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:13.588
- Then how is it in your possession?
- That's my affair.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:18.217
- That's one explanation.
- Lord Beekman knows. Ask him.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:22.764
We've already done so.
He denied knowing anything about it

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:24.807
and departed for Africa.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:32.565
- Piggie wouldn't do that!
- Are you going to give back the tiara?

01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:36.486
I wouldn't dream of it.
It's mine. I'm keeping it.

01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:39.906
That remains to be seen. Come, Pritchard.

01:01:40.573 --> 01:01:46.120
- You'll find that I mean business.
- Then why are you wearing that hat?

01:01:48.373 --> 01:01:50.583
- I want to talk.
- My mind's made up.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:54.504
The simplest way out of this
is to give it back.

01:01:54.587 --> 01:02:00.593
I do not care to converse with you.
We won't be in to him during our stay.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.972
- I regret you will not stay here.
- What now?

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:09.310
Esmond canceled your reservation
and letter of credit.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.188
- After hearing from you.
- That's right.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.068
I don't believe it.
Mr. Esmond wouldn't do that. Did he?

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:21.781
Exactly. He refuses responsibility
for your bills.

01:02:22.198 --> 01:02:27.245
- We've just spent all of our money.
- That's not our concern.

01:02:27.328 --> 01:02:31.124
Let's get out of here.
I hear your plumbing is noisy.

01:02:31.207 --> 01:02:34.669
If you need help, I'm at the Elysées Hotel.

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:37.255
You hold your breath till I call.

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:52.895
Mademoiselle?

01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:01.446
Café.

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:07.201
When love goes wrong

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:11.581
Nothing goes right

01:03:11.706 --> 01:03:16.085
This one thing I know

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:21.674
When love goes wrong

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:25.261
A man takes flight

01:03:25.386 --> 01:03:31.809
And women get uppity

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.564
The sun don’t beam

01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:40.234
The moon don’t shine

01:03:40.485 --> 01:03:46.949
The tide don’t ebb and flow

01:03:48.409 --> 01:03:51.913
The clock won’t strike

01:03:52.121 --> 01:03:55.583
A match won’t light

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.462
When love goes wrong

01:03:59.754 --> 01:04:02.757
Nothing goes right

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:08.262
The blues all gather round you

01:04:08.471 --> 01:04:10.264
Crazy, mademoiselle!

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:17.522
And day is dark as night

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:21.609
A man ain't fit.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:24.946
...to live With

01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:30.618
And a woman's a sorry sight

01:04:33.329 --> 01:04:36.791
When love goes wrong

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:40.127
Nothing goes right

01:04:40.211 --> 01:04:46.425
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right

01:04:46.634 --> 01:04:48.886
Do it, honey! Do it!

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:51.764
When love goes wrong

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:57.061
Nothing goes, nothing goes right

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:04.068
When love goes wrong
Nothing goes right

01:05:04.318 --> 01:05:09.323
Bees don’t buzz, fish don’t bite
Clock won’t strike, match won’t light

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:13.953
When love goes wrong

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:17.582
Nothing goes right

01:05:21.127 --> 01:05:24.672
A woman's a fright, a terrible sight

01:05:24.964 --> 01:05:29.093
Man goes out, gets high as a kite
Love is something you can't fight

01:05:29.302 --> 01:05:31.679
You can't fight it, honey.

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:35.975
When love goes wrong, nothing

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:39.103
No bows, honey, just eight bars and off.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.482
Nothing goes right

01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:47.445
Just in time.

01:05:47.695 --> 01:05:54.368
It's like we said
You're better off dead

01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:00.124
When love has lost its glow

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:05.129
So take this down

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:08.174
In black and white

01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:12.553
When love goes wrong

01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:16.015
Nothing goes right

01:06:16.098 --> 01:06:19.935
When love goes wrong

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:24.607
Nothing goes right

01:06:52.468 --> 01:06:54.428
Oh, dear.

01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:12.947
- Right over there, monsieur.
- Thank you.

01:07:13.531 --> 01:07:14.740
Lorelei?

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.036
Hello. You remember
Mr. Esmond, don't you?

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.413
Perfectly.

01:07:20.621 --> 01:07:24.875
Why not say hello?
He used to be a friend of ours.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:28.796
- Nice to see you again.
- Yes, indeed.

01:07:28.963 --> 01:07:32.466
Lorelei. Lorelei, wait!

01:07:32.633 --> 01:07:36.303
I've flown the Atlantic Ocean to talk to you.

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:41.308
- You can come in. If you don't mind?
- I don't mind if you don't mind.

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:44.645
- Mr. Esmond?
- Thank you.

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:49.150
Aren't you even gonna say you're sorry?

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.656
I won't fall in love with a man who
won't trust me, no matter what I do.

01:07:55.948 --> 01:07:59.452
"No matter what..."?
That's being unreasonable.

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.662
Well, goodbye, then.

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:04.123
How can I trust you
after all Father's found out?

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:09.628
- We're ready to dress you.
- Be right there.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.173
Lorelei, I...

01:08:12.423 --> 01:08:15.134
Men like you have made me the way I am.

01:08:15.342 --> 01:08:19.680
If you loved me at all,
you'd feel sorry for my troubles,

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:25.685
instead of holding them against me.
Don't say another word.

01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:30.024
I wasn't gonna say anything.

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:36.363
You have a tough time. If you want
to get upset, watch her next number.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.657
You mean...

01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:42.828
Oh, dear. Thank you.

01:10:00.406 --> 01:10:02.283
No!

01:10:17.089 --> 01:10:23.220
No, no, no, no, no, no

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:29.977
No

01:10:30.394 --> 01:10:31.478
No

01:10:32.104 --> 01:10:35.900
No, no, no, no, no

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:41.155
No, no

01:10:41.322 --> 01:10:45.451
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:10:45.618 --> 01:10:47.411
No!

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:55.085
The French are glad to die for love

01:10:55.336 --> 01:11:00.466
They delight in fighting duels

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:04.178
But I prefer a man who lives

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:11.352
And gives expensive jewels

01:11:11.518 --> 01:11:16.732
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:21.779
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:25.032
A kiss may be grand

01:11:25.324 --> 01:11:29.286
But it won’t pay the rental
On your humble flat

01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:32.498
Or help you at the automat

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:37.378
Men grow cold as girls grow old

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:42.633
And we all lose our charms in the end

01:11:42.883 --> 01:11:47.805
But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don’t lose their shape

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:53.477
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:57.231
Tiffany's!

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.319
Cartier!

01:12:03.737 --> 01:12:06.073
Black, Starr, Frost, Gorham

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:10.077
Talk to me, Harry Winston
Tell me all about it!

01:12:13.914 --> 01:12:18.877
There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer

01:12:19.086 --> 01:12:24.008
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:12:24.258 --> 01:12:26.218
There may come a time

01:12:26.427 --> 01:12:31.849
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:35.185
But get that ice
Or else no dice

01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:39.606
He’s your guy when stocks are high

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:44.945
But beware when they start to descend

01:12:45.237 --> 01:12:50.576
It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses

01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:54.788
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:08.427
I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:13.307
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:13:13.599 --> 01:13:18.562
And I think affairs that
You must keep liaisonic

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:24.318
Are better bets
If little pets get big baguettes

01:13:24.568 --> 01:13:28.739
Time rolls on
And youth is gone

01:13:28.989 --> 01:13:33.452
And you can't straighten up
When you bend

01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:39.625
But stiff back or stiff knees
You stand straight at...

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:44.463
...Tiffany's

01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:51.637
Diamonds

01:13:54.348 --> 01:13:57.101
Diamonds

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:04.358
I don’t mean rhinestones

01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:07.694
But diamonds

01:14:08.362 --> 01:14:11.698
Are a girl's best

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:17.204
Best friend

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:31.802
- How did Gus like your number?
- He looked kind of grim.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:34.054
Hand me my hat, please.

01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:37.891
He is sweet, isn't he? I really do love Gus.

01:14:38.142 --> 01:14:39.476
You do?

01:14:39.685 --> 01:14:43.522
There's no other millionaire
with such a gentle disposition.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:47.234
He never wins an argument,
does anything I ask,

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:52.322
and he's got the money to do it.
How can I help loving him?

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:55.492
I guess so. Let's don't talk about love.

01:14:55.576 --> 01:14:58.537
It reminds me of Malone,
the human ferret.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:08.714
The police are here!
They have a warrant for your arrest.

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:13.218
It will get in the newspapers.
It will hurt my business.

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:16.763
Give up that tiara.

01:15:17.014 --> 01:15:20.350
If I give it back, it's admitting I stole it.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:24.938
You're in a strange country.
You can't prove you didn't steal it.

01:15:25.105 --> 01:15:28.275
Do you want to go to the Bastille?

01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:31.111
- I guess I'll give it back.
- Where is it?

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:33.572
- In there.
- Come on, let's get it.

01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:38.035
- Oh, Dorothy. It's just not fair.
- No, of course not.

01:15:40.621 --> 01:15:41.914
It's gone!

01:15:42.039 --> 01:15:45.292
What? Are you sure
this is where you left it?

01:15:45.584 --> 01:15:48.879
Yes. It's been stolen! It's been stolen!

01:15:50.464 --> 01:15:54.384
The cops! Sister, we really are in a jam.

01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:56.470
Come on.

01:15:57.804 --> 01:16:01.808
- I'll give you a boost.
- Lorelei? It's me, Gus.

01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:06.146
- He's your best chance.
- He can't boost me any higher than you.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:07.231
Lorelei?

01:16:07.314 --> 01:16:12.402
Just a minute. Either you hock
your stuff or get the money from him.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:16.657
- How much will a tiara cost?
-15,000 at least.

01:16:16.907 --> 01:16:21.745
- That'll take an hour and 45 minutes.
-I'll take care of the gendarmes.

01:16:21.912 --> 01:16:23.247
How?

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:26.166
You're not the only one here
with hidden talents.

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:28.377
- Lorelei?
- Coming!

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:31.505
You can come in now.

01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:35.342
I've made up my mind.
We're through. Through forever.

01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:40.931
- First I want to kiss you goodbye.
- Very well.

01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:47.688
No, no. Not in front of everybody.
Come on in, Daddy darling.

01:16:54.236 --> 01:16:58.031
- This is your flight.
- Thanks very much.

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:10.961
- Until you finish customs...
- I want to speak with this gentleman.

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:13.171
- Well?
- Have a nice trip?

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.050
- My son, where is he?
- In the café where the girls work.

01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:20.846
I explicitly told you to stay with him.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:24.975
He can't be left alone
with that blonde man-trap.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:26.685
He's perfectly safe.

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:32.399
Right now, the man-trap is in court
explaining things to the police.

01:17:32.566 --> 01:17:36.528
- That's better.
- We'll go when you're through customs.

01:17:36.737 --> 01:17:38.196
I'll be right with you.

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:48.874
I beg your pardon.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:52.586
Sir Beekman. I heard you'd gone to Africa.

01:17:52.753 --> 01:17:57.090
What'd you say?
My name is not Beekman, I'm Amos Finch.

01:17:57.257 --> 01:17:58.550
All right.

01:17:58.759 --> 01:18:02.721
Don't be in such a rush.
You're the chap on the boat?

01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:03.930
lam.

01:18:04.514 --> 01:18:08.101
- I was joking. Of course I'm Beekman.
- You're sure?

01:18:08.352 --> 01:18:13.273
My plane leaves in an hour.
Do you know where to find Miss Lee?

01:18:13.523 --> 01:18:17.903
- I think so.
- Give her a message after I've gone.

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:24.076
Tell her that I had no choice.
What I did, I had to do.

01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:27.579
She'd understand if she knew my wife.

01:18:27.788 --> 01:18:30.540
Tell her I know money
means nothing to her.

01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:34.252
- But I'll make it up to her.
-I'll tell her.

01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:39.049
Thanks awfully, old boy
It'll be a great favor.

01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:43.887
- All right, take me to this young lady.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:28.974
- You will please swear, Miss Lee.
- Oh, judge, I never swear.

01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:34.688
Swear to tell nothing but the truth.
Will you do that?

01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:39.860
- Well, yeah. Thank you ever so.
- Sit down.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.492
You are being held for trial
for a charge of grand larceny.

01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:52.706
The plaintiff attests you stole
a headpiece of diamond, a tiara.

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:56.877
My goodness, judge,
a girl needs time to think.

01:19:57.127 --> 01:20:00.380
You're so much more intelligent
than poor little me.

01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:02.883
Won't you tell me what to say?

01:20:03.133 --> 01:20:08.388
- Please to answer the charge
- Yes, I was going to.

01:20:08.889 --> 01:20:13.977
I was just thinking.
It was all a terrible misunderstanding

01:20:14.186 --> 01:20:18.356
You see, sometimes life is
very hard for a girl like I.

01:20:18.565 --> 01:20:23.069
Especially if she's pretty
like I and has blonde hair.

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:27.157
We can do without the philosophy.
Facts only.

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:32.829
Mr. Pritchard is a little confused
and would like to ask a question.

01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:35.749
I can hardly blame him. What is it?

01:20:35.999 --> 01:20:41.254
He doesn't see well, and would like
to look at Miss Lee more closely.

01:20:41.546 --> 01:20:43.548
Permission granted.

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:51.223
Mr. Pritchard, how nice to see you!

01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:54.768
Yes, Miss Lee...
You are Miss Lee, aren't you?

01:20:54.935 --> 01:20:59.606
That's who I am, all right.
But my friends call me Lorelei.

01:20:59.773 --> 01:21:05.278
I hope you're my friend. I love to
have handsome gentlemen be my friends.

01:21:05.612 --> 01:21:07.781
My eyes are not that good.

01:21:07.948 --> 01:21:10.283
- Have you ever heard me sing?
- No.

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:13.745
- Are you sure?
-I've not had the pleasure.

01:21:13.954 --> 01:21:15.747
Thank you ever so!

01:21:16.206 --> 01:21:21.294
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental

01:21:21.545 --> 01:21:26.633
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.135
A kiss may be grand

01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:34.140
But it won’t pay the rental
On your humble flat

01:21:34.391 --> 01:21:37.310
Or help you at the automat

01:21:37.602 --> 01:21:42.274
Men grow cold as girls grow old

01:21:42.482 --> 01:21:47.279
And we all lose our charms in the end

01:21:48.238 --> 01:21:53.159
Square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don’t lose their shape

01:21:53.451 --> 01:21:55.412
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

01:21:55.579 --> 01:21:59.249
This is not a cabaret! Stop that woman!

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.501
Tiffany's!

01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:06.965
Cartier!

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:15.974
Black, Starr, Frost, Gorham

01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:19.185
Talk to me, Harry Winston
Talk to me

01:22:19.436 --> 01:22:23.940
Did you hear me? Stop her!
Get her to the Witness stand!

01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:27.694
The rest of you take your places.

01:22:28.653 --> 01:22:30.530
You are fired!

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.617
How could my son get mixed up
with that type of girl?

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:43.710
Now, young lady,
we're here to dispense justice.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.839
Not to watch a cabaret show.
You understand me?

01:22:48.048 --> 01:22:51.551
- Yes, judge.
- All right.

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:55.221
Did you or did you not steal
the diamond tiara?

01:22:55.555 --> 01:22:58.642
Oh, no, sir. I did not steal it.

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:02.979
The fact is, Lady Beekman's
husband gave it to me.

01:23:03.188 --> 01:23:05.607
Your Honor! The defendant is not...

01:23:09.319 --> 01:23:13.990
- You have evidence for this case?
- Yes, I have.

01:23:14.199 --> 01:23:17.035
Before he talks, could I explain something?

01:23:17.243 --> 01:23:18.870
Go ahead.

01:23:19.079 --> 01:23:24.751
I have a friend named Dorothy,
and she's a really good friend.

01:23:24.918 --> 01:23:28.755
She knows I would never do
anything really wrong.

01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:34.260
- Do you have to say this?
- Yes, sir, I do.

01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:40.016
There's a young man that Dorothy likes.
She's very fond of him.

01:23:40.225 --> 01:23:43.853
Dorothy would never speak
to this man again

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:48.274
if he did anything to hurt me, Lorelei.

01:23:48.525 --> 01:23:52.904
So I think this young man had
just better know that...

01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:57.534
Dorothy thinks she's in love with him.

01:23:58.284 --> 01:24:01.871
Mr. Esmond, I resign. I just quit the case.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.623
Are you crazy?

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:07.919
But I like it that way.
Judge, I've changed my mind.

01:24:08.128 --> 01:24:10.880
I haven't anything to say.

01:24:11.089 --> 01:24:14.134
This becomes more and more confusing.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:19.597
But the solution is simple.

01:24:19.806 --> 01:24:23.226
The property will be placed
in this court's custody

01:24:23.435 --> 01:24:29.149
until the owner can be established
by an affidavit from Lord Beekman.

01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:33.570
Now, Miss Lee, you will give me the tiara.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.991
- But I can't.
- If you refuse, you go to prison.

01:24:38.158 --> 01:24:41.494
I just haven't got it. It was stolen.

01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:45.457
I think I know where that thing is,
and who's got it.

01:24:45.665 --> 01:24:48.835
- Who are you?
- A private detective.

01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:54.048
Give me two policemen and wait
half an hour. I can settle this.

01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:56.718
Anything would be better than this.
Go with him.

01:25:04.768 --> 01:25:06.519
There he is.

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:12.525
What's that?

01:25:12.984 --> 01:25:15.069
What's he saying?

01:25:15.737 --> 01:25:19.407
Speak English! This is outrageous!

01:25:19.616 --> 01:25:21.910
I'm a British subject!

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:25.830
This is positively outrageous!
I demand a lawyer.

01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:29.292
What?

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:33.338
- What did you say?
- He says remove your hat.

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:36.841
Why doesn't he say so?
Send for the consulate.

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:39.552
-I'll take this.
- Give that back.

01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:45.016
This is Sir Francis Beekman.
And this is the missing tiara.

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:48.394
- That's mine!
- Miss Lee will be glad to return it.

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:50.563
I certainly would.

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:54.943
I believe His Honor asked
Miss Lee for the tiara.

01:25:55.235 --> 01:25:59.113
- I say, that isn't...
- I wouldn't go into that, Mr. Finch.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.573
Finch?

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.535
- Miss Lee.
- Thank you.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.123
- Your Honor.
- Thank you.

01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:11.876
Thank you.

01:26:13.419 --> 01:26:16.589
- Monsieur Pritchard.
- Thank you. Your Lordship.

01:26:16.798 --> 01:26:17.882
Thank you.

01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:20.760
Case dismissed!

01:26:21.761 --> 01:26:24.264
Five minutes ago you said you'd marry me.

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:29.227
- That's before Dorothy phoned.
- What made you change your mind?

01:26:29.435 --> 01:26:32.313
She just said everything's okay now.

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:37.151
I don't quite understand...
Oh, dear. Hello, Father.

01:26:37.443 --> 01:26:38.945
Hello, son.

01:26:39.112 --> 01:26:43.783
I know why you're here, and I don't care.
I'll make her marry me.

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:45.952
That's wonderful.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.790
I presume this is the young lady?
A pretty girl. American?

01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:53.918
Yes, except on my parents' side.
They're Irish.

01:26:54.127 --> 01:26:59.424
I'm delighted. I've wanted to
see you married for a long time.

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.510
Anybody but that monster, Lorelei Lee.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.514
But, Mr. Esmond, I am Lorelei Lee!

01:27:06.806 --> 01:27:10.101
Pretty early to start teasing
your father-in-law.

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:14.314
- What's the matter, Father?
- Nothing. I can take a joke.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.444
What joke? This is Lorelei.
This is nothing to joke about

01:27:19.652 --> 01:27:24.699
I don't have my driver's license
with me, but take my word for it.

01:27:24.991 --> 01:27:29.454
Look, that's I. See my name?

01:27:29.913 --> 01:27:31.497
Oh!

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.584
I'm too old for this sort of thing.

01:27:34.876 --> 01:27:37.754
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

01:27:37.837 --> 01:27:42.133
How do you think I feel with
thousands of Lorelei Lees around me?

01:27:42.342 --> 01:27:45.219
But you're not marrying any of them!

01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:49.349
I love her. I love her very much.
I've never felt...

01:27:49.515 --> 01:27:54.562
Oh, shut up!
Young lady, you don't fool me one bit.

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:58.149
I'm not trying to. But I bet I could.

01:27:58.358 --> 01:28:02.904
You might convince this jackass,
but you'll never convince me.

01:28:03.154 --> 01:28:08.201
- That's too bad. I do love him.
- Certainly. For his money.

01:28:08.368 --> 01:28:10.495
No! Honestly.

01:28:10.745 --> 01:28:15.708
You expect me to believe that you
aren't marrying him for his money?

01:28:16.042 --> 01:28:19.420
- It's true.
- Then why do you want to marry him?

01:28:19.671 --> 01:28:23.883
- I want to marry him for your money.
- There!

01:28:25.259 --> 01:28:28.054
That's why we need his consent, silly.

01:28:28.262 --> 01:28:32.850
We're getting down to brass tacks.
You admit you're after money.

01:28:33.059 --> 01:28:36.604
No, I don't. Aren't you funny?

01:28:36.854 --> 01:28:41.234
Don't you know that a rich man
is like a pretty girl?

01:28:41.526 --> 01:28:44.404
You don't marry her
just because she's pretty.

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.073
But, my goodness, doesn't it help?

01:28:47.281 --> 01:28:51.536
Would you want your daughter
to marry a poor man?

01:28:51.744 --> 01:28:56.416
You'd want her to have the most
wonderful things in the world.

01:28:56.582 --> 01:28:59.377
Why is it wrong for me
to want those things?

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:01.587
Well, I concede that...

01:29:01.796 --> 01:29:05.883
Say, they told me you were stupid.
You don't sound stupid.

01:29:06.092 --> 01:29:10.430
I can be smart when it's important.
But most men don't like it.

01:29:10.638 --> 01:29:14.434
Except Gus. He's interested in my brains.

01:29:14.851 --> 01:29:19.772
- No, that much of a fool he's not.
- You've changed your mind?

01:29:19.897 --> 01:29:25.653
- I just don't know what to tell you.
- Daddy?

01:29:25.945 --> 01:29:28.781
Not you. I guess I mean "Sonny."

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:32.452
Give me three minutes
alone with your father.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.580
- Run along, darling.
- Yes, dear.

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:38.416
Now, about what we were speaking.

01:29:38.624 --> 01:29:42.795
There's a great deal to consider.
I just can't answer...

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.310
Please, take your places.

01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:15.495
Remember, on your wedding day
it's all right to say yes.

01:30:19.707 --> 01:30:26.339
We’re just two little girls
From Little Rock

01:30:27.673 --> 01:30:34.138
And we lived on the wrong side
Of the tracks

01:30:35.389 --> 01:30:39.519
But at last we won the big crusade

01:30:39.727 --> 01:30:45.399
Looks like we finally made the grade

01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:54.492
Square-cut or pear-shaped

01:30:54.575 --> 01:30:58.538
These rocks don’t lose their shape

01:30:59.956 --> 01:31:05.670
Diamonds
Diamonds

01:31:06.546 --> 01:31:12.844
Diamonds are a girl's...
Diamonds are a girl's...

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:17.557
best friend

01:31:21.686 --> 01:31:22.687
