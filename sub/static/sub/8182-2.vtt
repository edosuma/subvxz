00:36.418 --> 00:37.152
HERE YOU GO.

00:37.303 --> 00:38.936
OH, THANKS.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.276
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
INTO ME.

00:45.344 --> 00:46.711
WHAT?

00:46.779 --> 00:48.613
LOOK WHAT SHE GAVE ME.
SHE GAVE ME PRETZELS.

00:48.681 --> 00:50.648
LOOK AT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
HAS-PEANUTS.

00:50.716 --> 00:51.983
SO?

00:52.051 --> 00:53.184
SO I WAS IN HERE
THE OTHER DAY.

00:53.252 --> 00:55.353
I TOLD HER I WAS
ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS.

00:55.421 --> 00:57.155
AND SIENNA
REMEMBERED.

00:57.222 --> 00:58.590
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S
INTO YOU, ALL RIGHT?

00:58.657 --> 01:01.226
IT MEANS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO OPEN YOUR THROAT WITH A PEN.

01:01.293 --> 01:04.462
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST FACE IT, DANNY.

01:04.530 --> 01:08.433
THE "PRETTY LADY" BUS HAS
JUST PULLED IN TO SPENCEVILLE.

01:09.802 --> 01:11.202
COME ON, YOU GOT
TO CHOOSE.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.637
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.238
UM, I GUESS I'D
RATHER HAVE

01:14.306 --> 01:16.007
MY FEET CUT OFF.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.859
SO YOU'RE GONNA GO NO FEET
INSTEAD OF NO HANDS.

01:17.927 --> 01:19.528
ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE
YOU GONNA WALK?

01:19.595 --> 01:21.730
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. YOU
SAID I HAD TO PICK ONE.

01:21.797 --> 01:23.281
I KNOW. BUT THE OBVIOUS
CHOICE IS HANDS.

01:23.349 --> 01:26.817
I MEAN, YOU NEED FEET
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND.

01:26.885 --> 01:29.036
YOU HAVE FEET AND YOU
DON'T MOVE AROUND.

01:32.558 --> 01:34.459
THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO
HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.310
WE'D BETTER GET GOING OR
WE'LL BE LATE FOR THE MOVIE.

01:36.378 --> 01:37.712
OH, I'M NOT GONNA BE LATE
BECAUSE I GOT FEET.

01:37.780 --> 01:40.681
GOOD LUCK GETTING THERE
ON YOUR ANKLE NUBS, YEAH.

01:40.749 --> 01:41.850
YOU ALL SET?

01:41.917 --> 01:43.118
UH, YEP.

01:43.185 --> 01:46.454
AND THIS IS FOR YOU.

01:46.521 --> 01:47.588
OH, THANKS.

01:47.656 --> 01:49.657
LET ME GET YOU
SOME CHANGE.

01:49.725 --> 01:51.442
OH, NO SWEAT. KEEP IT.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.078
HEY! THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.097
HOW MUCH DID YOU
GIVE HER?

01:56.165 --> 01:57.498
I DON'T KNOW.
FIVE BUCKS.

01:57.567 --> 01:58.833
FIVE?!

01:58.901 --> 02:00.167
I ONLY GAVE HER TWO,

02:00.235 --> 02:01.736
AND OUR CHECKS WERE
EXACTLY THE SAME.

02:01.804 --> 02:04.155
HEY, MAN, I USED
TO BE A WAITER, ALL RIGHT?

02:04.223 --> 02:07.591
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO SERVE IDIOTS LIKE YOU.

02:07.659 --> 02:10.276
YOU MADE ME LOOK BAD
IN FRONT OF SIENNA.

02:10.345 --> 02:13.264
NO. I THINK THE THING HANGING OUT
OF YOUR NOSE BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.438
THE MOVIE REALLY
GOT ME THINKING.

02:20.506 --> 02:23.441
I MEAN, WHY AREN'T THERE PEOPLE
LIVING ON MERCURY RIGHT NOW?

02:23.509 --> 02:25.076
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
IT'S 800 DEGREES.

02:25.143 --> 02:27.078
WE'D BURN UP IN,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS.

02:27.145 --> 02:28.646
NO. IF WE'RE WEARING,
LIKE, SPECIAL SUITS,

02:28.681 --> 02:30.081
LIKE NICK NOLTE
AND MARTIN LAWRENCE.

02:30.148 --> 02:33.884
P.S., THEY'D BE GREAT IN
"THE DOUG AND DEACON STORY."

02:33.952 --> 02:36.170
OH. I GOT TWO MESSAGES.

02:36.238 --> 02:37.639
IT'S ME. LISTEN,
REAL QUICK,

02:37.706 --> 02:39.307
THERE'S A PIE
IN THE FRIDGE.

02:39.375 --> 02:40.808
IT'S FOR
MY BOOK CLUB.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.477
PLEASE DON'T
TOUCH IT.

02:42.544 --> 02:43.578
DOUG...

02:43.646 --> 02:46.113
PLEASE. BYE.

02:46.181 --> 02:48.633
WE'LL SEE.

02:48.701 --> 02:49.834
HI.

02:49.902 --> 02:52.136
I HOPE THIS IS THE DOUG HEFFERNAN

02:52.205 --> 02:55.073
I MET IN THE HAMPTONS. IT'S JESSICA.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.875
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT LAST WEEKEND.

02:57.943 --> 03:01.496
HOW GOOD
YOU SMELLED,

03:01.563 --> 03:05.667
HOW YOUR
LIPS TASTED,

03:05.734 --> 03:07.835
ABOUT WHAT WE DID ON THE BEACH.

03:10.071 --> 03:12.273
ANYWAY, YOU GOT MY
NUMBER. GIVE ME A CALL.

03:17.046 --> 03:18.663
TALK TO ME, PLAYER.

03:20.633 --> 03:24.753
IS IT POSSIBLE
I BLACKED OUT...

03:27.089 --> 03:28.690
WENT TO THE HAMPTONS...

03:30.092 --> 03:34.428
AND LET A VERY HOT
GIRL TASTE ME?

03:36.399 --> 03:38.349
I'M GUESSING NO, BUT WHAT
WAS THAT ABOUT? DAMN!

03:38.417 --> 03:39.550
I DON'T KNOW.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.019
I GUESS THERE'S ANOTHER DOUG HEFFERNAN.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.354
SHE PROBABLY GOT MY NUMBER BY MISTAKE.

03:43.422 --> 03:45.606
I GOT TO ERASE THAT, THOUGH.
CARRIE CAN'T HEAR THAT.

03:45.674 --> 03:47.441
WHAT FOR? YOU
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

03:47.509 --> 03:49.660
NO. TRUST ME. SHE'S GOT
QUITE A JEALOUS STREAK GOING.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.029
IF SHE HEARS THAT...

03:51.096 --> 03:52.630
OK, OK.

03:52.697 --> 03:54.199
I'M SERIOUS, MAN. ONCE
I WAS IN A SUPERMARKET

03:54.266 --> 03:56.033
AND ANOTHER GIRL
JUST LOOKED AT ME.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.403
CARRIE BEAT HER
WITH A CANTALOUPE.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.138
SO I NEVER GOT THIS MESSAGE,

04:00.205 --> 04:02.307
AND I NEVER GOT
THE ONE ABOUT THE PIE.

04:02.374 --> 04:03.641
LET'S GO.

04:13.435 --> 04:14.402
YELLO.

04:14.469 --> 04:15.403
DOUG?

04:15.470 --> 04:16.404
YEAH.

04:16.471 --> 04:18.940
HI. IT'S JESSICA
FROM THE HAMPTONS.

04:19.007 --> 04:21.024
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER ME.

04:21.093 --> 04:23.395
UH, YEAH. ACTUALLY,
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

04:23.462 --> 04:24.729
YOU ARE?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.665
YEAH. LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS NOT ME WHO WAS WITH-

04:26.732 --> 04:28.049
HEY, WHO'S THAT?

04:28.117 --> 04:29.433
UH, MY MOM.

04:29.501 --> 04:31.035
OH! GOOD. I NEED TO GET
HER CREDIT CARD NUMBER

04:31.103 --> 04:32.870
IF SHE STILL WANTS
THOSE THEATER TICKETS.

04:32.938 --> 04:34.405
OK, YEAH. NO, I'LL-
I'LL TELL HER.

04:34.473 --> 04:36.774
I GOT IT. EXCUSE ME.

04:36.842 --> 04:38.659
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:38.727 --> 04:42.013
THAT'S OK, SEXY. YOU'RE
WORTH WAITING FOR.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.082
LISTEN, I JUST WANT YOU TO
KNOW, I'M NOT THE GUY WHO YOU-

04:44.150 --> 04:45.750
YOUR VOICE SOUNDS
DEEPER ON THE PHONE.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.585
REALLY? BECAUSE I'M JUST
TALKING, YOU KNOW, NORMALLY.

04:47.653 --> 04:48.953
I MEAN.

04:49.021 --> 04:50.588
HEY. DID YOU GET
THE CREDIT CARD NUMBER?

04:50.655 --> 04:52.406
OH, NO, I DIDN'T. I CAN'T
GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE.

04:52.474 --> 04:55.426
YOU KNOW MY MOM.
SHE'S SO CRAZY.

04:55.494 --> 04:58.379
LISTEN, IT SOUNDS LIKE I
CAUGHT YOU AT A BAD TIME.

04:58.447 --> 04:59.713
I- I'LL JUST CALL
BACK LATER.

04:59.781 --> 05:00.931
NO, NO, NO. NO,
NO. IT'S FINE.

05:00.999 --> 05:05.303
NO? YOU MEAN NO LIKE
YOU SAID ON THE BEACH?

05:05.371 --> 05:08.039
MM!

05:08.106 --> 05:09.607
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST TELL
HER THAT I'LL PUT THE TICKETS

05:09.675 --> 05:11.876
ON MY CREDIT CARD.
OH, OK.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.112
OK. I-I'LL DO IT.

05:16.781 --> 05:20.285
YOU HAVE A GREAT
NIGHT, SEXY. LOVE YOU.

05:20.352 --> 05:21.552
OK. LOVE YOU,
TOO. OK.

05:21.620 --> 05:24.222
MOM, MOM, MOM.

05:32.097 --> 05:34.465
HELLO.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.817
HELLO?

05:38.420 --> 05:40.621
THAT'S THE THIRD HANG UP
THIS MORNING.

05:40.689 --> 05:41.656
REALLY?

05:41.724 --> 05:43.074
YEAH. TWICE WHILE
YOU WERE IN THE SHOWER.

05:43.141 --> 05:44.625
LISTEN, TELL YOUR
GIRLFRIENDS TO AT LEAST WAIT

05:44.693 --> 05:46.227
UNTIL I'VE GONE TO WORK.

05:47.646 --> 05:48.780
HEY, CAR.

05:48.847 --> 05:50.147
HAVE A GOOD ONE.
ALL RIGHT.

05:53.385 --> 05:54.518
SHE CALLED AGAIN.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.054
WHO?

05:56.121 --> 05:58.556
JESSICA. SHE HUNG UP ON
CARRIE 3 TIMES THIS MORNING.

05:58.623 --> 05:59.958
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
FOR SURE IT WAS HER?

06:00.025 --> 06:02.927
TRUST ME. IT'S HER.
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

06:02.994 --> 06:04.778
YOU MEAN, WITH THE OTHER
DOUG HEFFERNAN.

06:04.846 --> 06:07.748
NO. WITH ME, TOO. OK,
SHE CALLED LAST NIGHT,

06:07.816 --> 06:09.517
AND, WELL,
WE TALKED.

06:09.584 --> 06:10.951
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
HER YOU WEREN'T THE SAME GUY?

06:11.020 --> 06:13.187
I TRIED, BUT CARRIE WAS
STANDING RIGHT THERE.

06:13.255 --> 06:16.357
WELL, SO NOW SHE THINKS YOU ARE
THE DOUG HEFFERNAN SHE SLEPT WITH?

06:16.424 --> 06:20.929
YES. AND I MAY HAVE
TOLD HER I LOVE HER.

06:22.297 --> 06:25.066
WOW. YOU KNOW, FOR SOMEONE
WHO DID NOTHING WRONG,

06:25.133 --> 06:27.801
YOU'VE DUG YOURSELF
QUITE A HOLE HERE.

06:29.104 --> 06:30.804
OH, GOOD. I HOPE
THAT'S HER.

06:32.875 --> 06:33.807
HELLO.

06:33.876 --> 06:35.042
HI, SEXY.

06:35.110 --> 06:35.993
JESSICA. IT'S JESSICA.

06:36.061 --> 06:38.295
YEAH, YEAH.
I GOT THAT.

06:38.363 --> 06:41.866
HEY, UH, I'M-I'M
GLAD YOU CALLED.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.869
UM, LOOK, THIS WHOLE THING
KIND OF GOT OUT OF CONTROL HERE,

06:44.937 --> 06:47.472
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE, I'M NOT
THE SAME PERSON YOU WERE WITH

06:47.540 --> 06:48.673
IN THE HAMPTONS.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.842
THAT NIGHT
CHANGED ME, TOO.

06:52.778 --> 06:54.662
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:54.730 --> 06:57.432
IT'S NOT ME. I DON'T-
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

06:57.499 --> 06:59.116
WHAT? WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, DOUG?

06:59.184 --> 07:01.820
LAST NIGHT YOU TELL
ME YOU LOVE ME,

07:01.887 --> 07:04.556
AND THEN THIS MORNING SOME
STRANGE WOMAN ANSWERS YOUR PHONE

07:04.623 --> 07:07.592
AND SUDDENLY YOU
DON'T KNOW ME?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.226
YES. SO WE'RE GOOD?

07:11.563 --> 07:13.881
LOOK, DOUG,
DON'T PLAY GAMES.

07:13.949 --> 07:16.367
IF THIS WAS ONLY A ONE-NIGHT
THING FOR YOU, JUST SAY SO

07:16.435 --> 07:17.902
AND YOU'LL NEVER HEAR
FROM ME AGAIN.

07:17.969 --> 07:19.103
NO, IT'S NOT THAT-

07:19.171 --> 07:20.305
JUST SAY IT!

07:20.372 --> 07:23.641
IT WAS A ONE-NIGHT
THING FOR ME.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.412
OH, GOD. I KNEW
IT, I KNEW IT!

07:27.479 --> 07:29.980
OH, HEY, COME ON.
DON'T CRY. COME ON.

07:30.048 --> 07:33.484
NO! LOOK, IT'S NOT YOU.

07:33.552 --> 07:35.420
IT'S-IT'S-IT'S ME.

07:35.487 --> 07:36.621
WHAT?

07:39.224 --> 07:40.341
YEAH, RIGHT.

07:40.408 --> 07:43.677
LOOK, YOU'RE
AN AWESOME PERSON,

07:43.746 --> 07:49.550
AND ONE DAY, YOU'RE GONNA FIND
SOMEONE JUST AS GOOD AS ME.

07:53.939 --> 07:57.675
WELL, I GUESS I'M LUCKY TO HAVE
HAD AT LEAST ONE NIGHT WITH YOU.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.612
NO, JESSICA,
WE'RE BOTH LUCKY.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.416
NOW, YOU GO HAVE
YOURSELF A GREAT LIFE.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.719
BYE.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.624
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

08:22.117 --> 08:24.735
4- BALL, SIDE POCKET.

08:24.803 --> 08:29.273
YEP. YOU GOT TO BE HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU GOT, DEAC.

08:29.341 --> 08:31.909
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

08:31.976 --> 08:34.611
KELLY. LOVE
YOUR WIFE, MAN.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.864
I DO LOVE MY WIFE.

08:36.931 --> 08:39.500
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD LOVE HER.

08:39.568 --> 08:43.087
YEAH, BECAUSE I'M NOT TAKING
CARRIE FOR GRANTED ANY MORE.

08:43.154 --> 08:45.523
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

08:45.591 --> 08:46.958
WHAT LESSON?
YOU DIDN'T CHEAT.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.728
WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX
IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.

08:50.796 --> 08:53.430
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
SEX IN ANY SENSE.

08:53.498 --> 08:54.699
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY WISHES

08:54.767 --> 08:56.333
THEY GOT THE WRONG MESSAGE
ON THEIR MACHINE.

08:57.803 --> 09:02.290
OK, SO I'M GONNA
LEAVE HER $5,

09:02.357 --> 09:05.526
AND I'M THINKING YOU
SHOULD STIFF HER.

09:05.594 --> 09:06.844
WHAT? NO, I'M NOT
STIFFING HER.

09:06.912 --> 09:09.213
OH, COME ON. YOU OWE ME
ONE, MR. BIG TIPPER.

09:09.281 --> 09:11.199
AND BY THE WAY,
I TALKED TO MY MOM.

09:11.266 --> 09:13.534
12% IS VERY GENEROUS
FOR BEVERAGES.

09:13.601 --> 09:15.369
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS WHOLE
THING IS REALLY STUPID,

09:15.437 --> 09:16.904
AND I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

09:16.971 --> 09:19.306
OH, I SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

09:19.374 --> 09:21.125
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:21.193 --> 09:22.727
YOU OVER-TIPPED ON PURPOSE
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

09:22.794 --> 09:24.862
IF I HOOK UP WITH
SOMEONE, I'M GONNA MOVE OUT

09:24.929 --> 09:26.130
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL ALONE.

09:26.197 --> 09:27.965
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT I DID,

09:28.032 --> 09:28.966
BECAUSE I'D HATE TO
COME HOME EVERY NIGHT

09:29.034 --> 09:32.236
NOT SEEING YOU DO
PILATES IN A HALF-SHIRT.

09:32.304 --> 09:33.537
HEY, LOOK, THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.373
THE POINT IS, EVER
SINCE THE HOLIDAYS,

09:35.440 --> 09:37.040
YOU'VE BECOME MORE
AND MORE POSSESSIVE.

09:37.108 --> 09:38.609
AND OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE NOTICED.

09:38.677 --> 09:39.994
OH, HAVE THEY?
YEAH. YEAH.

09:40.062 --> 09:41.796
OH, GOOD. SIENNA,
I'M READY.

09:43.598 --> 09:48.385
OK, THE BILL
FOR ME IS 10.85.

09:48.453 --> 09:50.488
HERE'S 20.
KEEP THE CHANGE.

09:50.555 --> 09:52.256
AH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:52.324 --> 09:55.876
UH, OK, WELL, UM,
THIS IS FOR THE FOOD.

09:55.944 --> 10:00.497
AND, UH, HERE'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING EXTRA FOR YOU.

10:00.565 --> 10:02.700
THIS IS A $100 BILL.

10:02.768 --> 10:06.453
YUP, THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

10:06.521 --> 10:10.308
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
EXPECT IN RETURN FOR THIS,

10:10.376 --> 10:11.759
BUT I'M NOT FOR SALE.

10:13.578 --> 10:15.380
SEE YOU AT HOME, LUMPY.

10:19.418 --> 10:23.270
MMM. THAT FEELS SO GOOD, BABY.
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

10:23.338 --> 10:25.973
NOTHING. I JUST GOT THE
GREATEST WIFE IN THE WORLD

10:26.040 --> 10:29.277
AND I WANT HER TO KNOW I APPRECIATE HER.

10:29.344 --> 10:33.063
DOUG, THAT IS SO SWEET.

10:39.638 --> 10:41.339
YOU'VE
REACHED THE HEFFERNAN HOUSE.

10:41.406 --> 10:42.606
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

10:42.674 --> 10:44.141
HI, DOUG.

10:48.313 --> 10:50.314
IT'S JESSICA.

10:50.382 --> 10:52.283
LOOK, I KNOW I PROMISED
NOT TO CALL AGAIN,

10:52.350 --> 10:53.885
BUT, UM...

10:53.952 --> 10:56.787
I'M HAVING SOME WINE AND...

10:56.855 --> 11:00.124
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING
ABOUT LAST SATURDAY,

11:00.192 --> 11:03.477
LYING NAKED ON THE SAND.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.685
I STILL QUIVER WHEN I THINK
ABOUT BEING WITH YOU.

11:11.753 --> 11:14.789
OH, GOD. WHAT AM I DOING?

11:14.857 --> 11:16.591
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED YOU.
I'M SORRY.

11:16.658 --> 11:19.259
I WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN.
I LOVE YOU.

11:25.534 --> 11:29.153
DEACON. HE IS THE MAN
OF A THOUSAND VOICES.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.320
COME ON.

11:30.388 --> 11:32.990
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

11:33.058 --> 11:34.509
OH, MY GOD. IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK, ALL RIGHT?

11:34.576 --> 11:37.077
LOOK, THERE'S ANOTHER DOUG HEFFERNAN,

11:37.146 --> 11:38.679
AND THIS GIRL, SHE GOT THE WRONG NUMBER.

11:38.747 --> 11:40.681
AND I TRIED TO TELL
HER I WASN'T THAT DOUG,

11:40.749 --> 11:42.350
BUT SHE DIDN'T
BELIEVE ME,

11:42.417 --> 11:44.168
SO I JUST- I HAD TO
BREAK UP WITH HER, AND-

11:47.523 --> 11:51.776
THAT DIDN'T GO WELL BECAUSE
SHE'S REALLY INTO ME.

11:53.428 --> 11:54.511
CARRIE,
I SWEAR TO GOD,

11:54.579 --> 11:55.847
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOU.

11:55.914 --> 11:57.398
I GOT TO THROW UP.
I SWEAR.

11:57.465 --> 12:00.083
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, CALM DOWN.

12:00.151 --> 12:02.052
I BELIEVE YOU.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.370
REALLY?

12:03.438 --> 12:06.890
YES. BUT NEXT TIME, INSTEAD
OF BEING SUCH AN IDIOT,

12:06.959 --> 12:09.676
TELL ME ABOUT IT, OK?

12:09.744 --> 12:10.895
AH, BABY, COME HERE.
YOU'RE TREMBLING.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.830
AW.
OK.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.048
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

12:14.115 --> 12:16.033
HEY, YOU'RE BEING REALLY
COOL ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW?

12:16.101 --> 12:18.336
OH, COME ON. I KNEW THAT THERE
WAS NO WAY THAT COULD BE YOU.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.394
UH...

12:27.962 --> 12:31.599
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
THAT THAT COULDN'T BE ME?

12:31.666 --> 12:34.234
OH. JUST BECAUSE I
TRUST YOU.

12:34.302 --> 12:37.772
AND THAT MESSAGE,
I MEAN, COME ON! HA HA!

12:37.839 --> 12:40.741
WE WEREN'T EVEN TOGETHER
SATURDAY NIGHT.

12:40.808 --> 12:42.509
I TOLD YOU I WENT BOWLING,
BUT I CAN'T EVEN PROVE THAT,

12:42.577 --> 12:45.412
BECAUSE I PAID CASH, SO THAT
VERY WELL COULD HAVE BEEN ME.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.249
THAT'S TRUE. STILL.

12:50.718 --> 12:54.338
FOR GOD'S SAKES, MY
- MY SHIRT WAS RIPPED WHEN I CAME HOME, REMEMBER?

12:54.405 --> 12:56.423
YEAH. YOU SAID YOU CAUGHT
IT IN THE BALL RETURN.

12:56.491 --> 12:57.641
AND YOU BELIEVED THAT?

12:57.709 --> 13:00.044
I MEAN, ANY REASONABLE PERSON
WOULD THINK I CHEATED ON YOU.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.762
OK, BABY.

13:08.470 --> 13:11.105
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING

13:11.172 --> 13:16.494
ABOUT LAST SATURDAY,
LYING NAKED ON THE SAND.

13:16.561 --> 13:20.514
I STILL QUIVER WHEN I THINK
ABOUT BEING WITH YOU.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.784
OH, GOD. WHAT AM I DOING-

13:23.852 --> 13:25.669
SHE DID NOT
JUST SAY "QUIVER."

13:25.737 --> 13:27.104
SHE DID.
AND DOUG WAS AFRAID

13:27.172 --> 13:29.006
THAT I WOULD THINK
IT WAS HIM.

13:32.327 --> 13:35.463
I GOT TO SAY, THOUGH, THIS OTHER
DOUG HEFFERNAN SOUNDS PRETTY AMAZING.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.147
HE DOES!

13:41.736 --> 13:43.787
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:43.855 --> 13:45.856
I'M JUST GONNA GOOGLE
THIS GUY JUST FOR KICKS.

13:45.924 --> 13:48.792
YOU KNOW, WHEN DOUG AND
I WERE FIRST ENGAGED,

13:48.860 --> 13:50.260
I WAS GETTING
COLD FEET,

13:50.328 --> 13:51.729
SO I WENT TO SEE THIS
PSYCHIC ON CONEY ISLAND,

13:51.796 --> 13:52.963
AND SHE SAID,

13:53.031 --> 13:56.734
"YES, DOUG HEFFERNAN IS
THE GUY YOU SHOULD MARRY."

13:56.801 --> 13:58.102
I HOPE I GOT
THE RIGHT ONE.

14:03.675 --> 14:06.810
SO YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE
SHE BELIEVED YOU?

14:06.878 --> 14:09.813
YES. I MEAN, I GIVE HER
SOME HALF-ASSED EXPLANATION,

14:09.881 --> 14:12.049
AND SHE ACCEPTS IT
JUST LIKE THAT?

14:12.117 --> 14:13.117
YOU KNOW WHAT I
SHOULD DO?

14:13.185 --> 14:14.952
I SHOULD GO OUT AND HAVE A REAL AFFAIR

14:15.019 --> 14:15.936
JUST TO SHOW HER.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.388
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

14:17.456 --> 14:19.123
NO. IT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF WORK.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.124
OH, GOD.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.492
WHAT?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.660
THE RED LIGHT'S BLINKING.
THAT'S HER AGAIN.

14:23.728 --> 14:25.162
IT COULD BE ANYBODY.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.498
OH, PLEASE. YOU'RE
HERE. WHO ELSE CALLS ME?

14:29.534 --> 14:31.001
HEY, DOUG HEFFERNAN,

14:31.069 --> 14:34.287
THIS IS HECTOR
- JESSICA'S BOYFRIEND. YOU'RE DEAD, YOU HEAR ME?

14:34.355 --> 14:36.089
YOUR FACE IS DEAD.
YOUR LEGS ARE DEAD.

14:36.157 --> 14:39.009
YOUR WHOLE BODY'S DEAD.
YOU ARE DEAD.

14:43.314 --> 14:46.617
NOW I'M REALLY STARTING
TO ENJOY THIS.

14:46.684 --> 14:49.053
SHUT UP, ALL RIGHT? I GOT
TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT HERE.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.387
I GOT
TO FIND JESSICA,

14:50.455 --> 14:51.856
HOOK HER UP WITH THE
OTHER DOUG HEFFERNAN,

14:51.923 --> 14:54.125
AND GET HER BOYFRIEND OFF MY BACK.

14:54.192 --> 14:55.426
AND I GOT
TO TELL YOU,

14:55.494 --> 14:58.496
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE NOT
CURSED WITH THIS CHARISMA.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.450
WHY DO I HAVE
TO TALK TO HER?

15:03.518 --> 15:06.386
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT SHE
THINKS THAT I THINK SHE'S A PROSTITUTE.

15:06.454 --> 15:08.321
OH, GOD. I CAN'T WAIT TILL
YOU FINALLY DO MOVE OUT

15:08.389 --> 15:10.524
AND I CAN STOP
CLEANING UP

15:10.592 --> 15:12.593
THIS MESS YOU CALL
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.261
YEAH, OK, JUST GO. GO.

15:19.017 --> 15:20.133
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

15:20.201 --> 15:21.569
AH, ANYTHING ON TAP.

15:21.636 --> 15:25.539
ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT MY FRIEND OVER THERE.

15:25.607 --> 15:27.858
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

15:27.926 --> 15:30.394
WELL, YOU KNOW
THE $100 HE GAVE YOU?

15:30.462 --> 15:33.096
HE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BAD BY IT.

15:33.164 --> 15:36.467
IT'S JUST THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU
GAVE HIM PRETZELS INSTEAD OF PEANUTS,

15:36.535 --> 15:39.570
HE HAD THIS STUPID IDEA
THAT YOU LIKED HIM.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.755
I DO LIKE HIM.

15:41.823 --> 15:42.906
COME AGAIN?

15:44.909 --> 15:46.977
I LIKE HIM A LOT.

15:48.129 --> 15:49.897
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THAT GUY RIGHT OVER THERE?

15:51.566 --> 15:53.266
YES. YES.

15:53.334 --> 15:56.320
THE REASON I GOT SO
UPSET ABOUT THE MONEY,

15:56.387 --> 15:58.622
I THOUGHT HE
DIDN'T RESPECT ME.

15:58.690 --> 16:01.858
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU COULD
REALLY GET SERIOUS WITH HIM?

16:01.926 --> 16:03.627
YEAH.

16:03.695 --> 16:06.363
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GUYS HIT
IT OFF AND GET A PLACE TOGETHER?

16:06.430 --> 16:07.965
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
HIS ROOMMATE, HUH? HUH?

16:09.985 --> 16:11.935
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR THEY SHARE
AND THE JOINT CHECKING ACCOUNT?

16:13.372 --> 16:15.372
UM, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY HERE.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.773
EXCUSE ME.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.215
SO?

16:24.282 --> 16:26.984
SORRY, BRO. SHE
AIN'T INTO DUDES.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.253
WHAT?!

16:29.321 --> 16:32.473
YEAH. WHO WANTS
TO GO TO IKEA?

16:33.742 --> 16:35.142
COME ON!

16:39.881 --> 16:43.817
YES. HI. I NEED TO MAKE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH DR. HEFFERNAN.

16:46.187 --> 16:48.138
OH, HE IS? OK,
HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEK?

16:48.206 --> 16:53.310
HE'S BOOKED ALL MONTH? LOOK,
I REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM.

16:53.377 --> 16:55.478
IS HE FREE FOR LUNCH?

16:56.915 --> 16:59.817
WORK WITH ME,
MILDRED. PLEASE.

16:59.884 --> 17:03.587
ALL RIGHT, COULD YOU
SEND ME A PICTURE OF HIM?

17:03.654 --> 17:05.488
NO, YOU'RE WEIRD.

17:11.996 --> 17:14.731
YEAH, I'M LOOKING FOR DOUG
HEFFERNAN. DOES HE LIVE HERE?

17:14.799 --> 17:16.016
YEAH.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.117
YEAH, WELL, HE'S BEEN
MESSING WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

17:17.184 --> 17:18.351
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

17:18.419 --> 17:20.921
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW
WHAT? CALM DOWN, CHACHI.

17:21.073 --> 17:24.574
LOOK, YOU GOT THE WRONG
DOUG HEFFERNAN, OK?

17:24.642 --> 17:27.676
HERE'S THE ADDRESS OF THE
GUY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

17:27.744 --> 17:29.196
AND GOOD LUCK GETTING
AN APPOINTMENT.

17:32.033 --> 17:34.802
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA COME WITH. HANG ON.

17:43.895 --> 17:45.329
WHO IS IT?

17:45.397 --> 17:46.547
IT'S DOUG HEFFERNAN.

17:46.614 --> 17:48.215
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD!

17:48.282 --> 17:52.953
NO, NO. NOT "OH, MY GOD." NO,
NO. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

17:53.020 --> 17:54.321
UM, IT'S JUST GONNA
BE A MINUTE.

17:54.389 --> 17:56.156
OH, GOD. MY PLACE
IS A MESS.

17:56.224 --> 17:58.942
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
CLEAN IT. I WOULDN'T.

17:59.010 --> 18:04.064
DOUG? UH,
WHERE'S DOUG?

18:04.131 --> 18:07.400
YOU'RE GONNA GET
A KICK OUT OF THIS.

18:08.703 --> 18:11.038
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WHEN WE GET THERE,

18:11.106 --> 18:13.607
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE, GET A
LOOK AT HIM, SEE WHAT'S WHAT,

18:13.674 --> 18:15.408
AND THEN YOU CAN CARVE HIM
UP LIKE A TURKEY, ALL RIGHT?

18:15.476 --> 18:18.128
WHOA! COULD YOU WATCH
THE POTHOLES?

18:18.196 --> 18:20.130
I ALMOST POKED
MY FRICKIN' EYE OUT.

18:20.198 --> 18:21.881
SORRY.

18:23.551 --> 18:25.769
AND DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW DEVASTATED I WAS

18:25.837 --> 18:27.471
WHEN YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME?

18:27.538 --> 18:30.140
HEY, IT WAS A BAD DAY
FOR BOTH OF US, OK?

18:30.208 --> 18:32.325
NOW, RELAX. I'M TAKING
YOU TO THE DOUG YOU WANT.

18:32.393 --> 18:33.911
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT

18:33.978 --> 18:35.587
SO THAT I'LL TELL MY
BOYFRIEND NOT TO KICK YOUR ASS.

18:35.622 --> 18:37.197
OH. YOU MEAN THE BOYFRIEND
YOU FORGOT TO MENTION

18:37.264 --> 18:38.849
WHILE WE WERE TOGETHER?

18:38.916 --> 18:40.584
LOOK, IT'S
COMPLICATED, OK?

18:42.687 --> 18:43.687
FINE.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.841
SO YOU LIKE
THE BEACH, HUH?

18:57.685 --> 18:59.286
OK, YOU GOT 5 MINUTES.

18:59.353 --> 19:03.123
OK, YOU POINT THAT FINGER AT ME
AGAIN, AND I'M GONNA BREAK IT OFF.

19:08.195 --> 19:09.646
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

19:09.714 --> 19:11.248
OK.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.183
CARRIE?

19:13.251 --> 19:15.135
HEY, LISTEN,
I'M IN A RUSH,

19:15.202 --> 19:17.036
SO I'LL JUST SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE.

19:17.104 --> 19:19.589
WHOA, WHOA! I JUST GOT
OUT OF MY CAR

19:19.657 --> 19:21.508
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, THE SAME
WOMAN WHO'S BEEN LEAVING

19:21.576 --> 19:25.528
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MESSAGES
ON THE MACHINE, HMM?

19:25.596 --> 19:26.597
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT TO RUN. BYE.

19:26.664 --> 19:27.698
WAIT A SECOND, CAR-

19:27.766 --> 19:29.266
I COULD HAVE JUST
AS EASILY SLEPT WITH HER.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.851
NO, YOU COULDN'T.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.703
SURE HE COULD. SHE'LL
SLEEP WITH ANYBODY.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.204
THANK YOU.
OK? SEE THAT?

19:34.272 --> 19:35.772
SHE'LL SLEEP WITH ANYBODY.
HEY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.040
I'M ANYBODY. YEAH!

19:37.108 --> 19:38.342
EXCUSE ME.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.109
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

19:39.176 --> 19:40.360
I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN UP TO.

19:40.428 --> 19:41.528
I'M SORRY. YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY.

19:41.595 --> 19:43.080
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING HERE?

19:43.148 --> 19:44.848
UM, I HAVE A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT.

19:44.916 --> 19:46.182
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.834
WELL, COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING A FAKE AFFAIR ALL WEEK.

19:47.902 --> 19:49.469
LET ME HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

19:49.537 --> 19:51.688
UH-UH. UH-UH. YOU'RE STUCK
WITH THIS DOUG HEFFERNAN,

19:51.756 --> 19:53.456
NOT DR. QUIVER. NOW,
LET'S GO HOME. COME ON.

19:53.524 --> 19:55.525
DOUG, COME ON.
I'VE COME ALL THIS WAY.

19:55.593 --> 19:57.460
LET ME JUST GET ONE
MINUTE WITH HIM.

19:57.528 --> 20:00.264
NOPE. I CAN'T HAVE ONE,
YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE.

20:00.331 --> 20:02.099
OH, PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM.
DON'T HURT HIM, HECTOR.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.284
OH, NO, NO. I'M NOT GONNA
HURT HIM. I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

20:04.352 --> 20:05.518
BUT, HECTOR, PLEASE!

20:05.586 --> 20:06.653
HE'S DEAD.

20:06.721 --> 20:07.921
OH, GOD!

20:09.623 --> 20:10.891
DR. HEFFERNAN,

20:10.958 --> 20:14.694
I THINK ANOTHER ONE OF
YOUR WOMEN IS HERE.

20:16.948 --> 20:18.915
OH, THAT'S THE ONE
FROM THE BEACH.

20:18.983 --> 20:21.251
I'D BETTER GO DOWN
THE BACK WAY.

20:31.345 --> 20:33.213
HI. IT'S KEN.

20:33.280 --> 20:37.851
UH, I HOPE THIS IS THE DOUG HEFFERNAN
I MET ON FIRE ISLAND LAST SUNDAY.

20:37.919 --> 20:41.254
ANYWAY, I'D LOVE TO TAKE
YOU UP ON THAT CUP OF COFFEE.

20:41.322 --> 20:42.488
CALL ME.

20:44.592 --> 20:46.427
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, DOUG?

20:46.494 --> 20:48.829
