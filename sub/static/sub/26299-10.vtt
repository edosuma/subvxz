WEBVTT

00:04.127 --> 00:05.541
Merry Christmas Eve, Alex.

00:05.562 --> 00:07.128
So, he's still alive...

00:07.163 --> 00:09.697
Must mean you haven't told
Mom you're pregnant yet.

00:09.732 --> 00:12.300
We want to be careful to do it right.

00:12.336 --> 00:13.803
Now you're being careful?

00:13.838 --> 00:15.371
I can't keep this secret anymore.

00:15.406 --> 00:16.370
Look at me!

00:17.122 --> 00:18.174
Ugh. She's going gray.

00:18.209 --> 00:19.709
Oh my God, she is!

00:19.744 --> 00:21.242
I was just gasping at the haircut.

00:21.279 --> 00:24.980
Apparently, this is what
happens when I feel stress now.

00:25.015 --> 00:26.782
Well, we're telling them today, okay?

00:26.817 --> 00:28.217
That way, if Mom freaks,

00:28.252 --> 00:30.919
she'll have 10 days in
Bermuda to calm down.

00:30.954 --> 00:32.455
Okay, then go now!

00:32.490 --> 00:34.491
She's never in a better
mood than on Christmas Eve.

00:34.525 --> 00:36.126
Wait, is this a good way to tell her?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.995
We hang a stocking for "Grandma Claire,"

00:38.029 --> 00:39.462
and when she goes, "I'm not a grandma,"

00:39.498 --> 00:41.732
we go,
"Tell that to Haley and my's baby."

00:44.089 --> 00:46.522
Promise me you won't
home school this kid.

00:48.026 --> 00:49.593
Hey, Mom. What are you doing?

00:49.627 --> 00:52.864
Ugh, Christmas cards are just clutter.

00:52.898 --> 00:54.032
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:54.066 --> 00:55.566
You can't throw away Uncle Cam's card.

00:55.602 --> 00:58.870
You know how sensitive he gets
about his piano placement.

00:58.905 --> 01:00.771
Remember that one year where his card

01:00.807 --> 01:03.541
was slightly behind the one
from our old babysitter?

01:03.576 --> 01:05.576
Mm, I believe
he spoke the charming phrase,

01:05.611 --> 01:07.078
"And who is this whore?"

01:07.112 --> 01:09.314
Well, Christmas
is at Grandpa's this year,

01:09.349 --> 01:12.651
so Cam will never see it.

01:12.687 --> 01:14.386
Check out the sledding polar bear paper.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.154
Can't look at that and not
be in a good mood, huh?

01:16.190 --> 01:16.988
Yeah.

01:17.023 --> 01:18.890
I am so sick of that stuff.

01:18.925 --> 01:21.693
I ordered five rolls from
some kid for a school drive.

01:21.729 --> 01:24.497
He shows up with fifty... his fault.

01:24.532 --> 01:25.663
Kid bursts into tears.

01:25.699 --> 01:27.699
Like it's on me that he can't count?

01:27.735 --> 01:29.901
- I was six, Mom.
- Mm.

01:32.339 --> 01:34.641
Bermuda just gets it...

01:34.676 --> 01:36.575
formal yet casual.

01:36.611 --> 01:38.577
And home of the most perfectly tanned

01:38.613 --> 01:40.980
lower thigh,
upper knee region in the world.

01:41.016 --> 01:43.315
Not hard to pick out a
Bermudan in a locker room.

01:43.351 --> 01:45.718
No. Oh, hang on.

01:45.754 --> 01:48.321
Wait. Well, this can't be right.

01:48.357 --> 01:50.322
This itinerary says
we're on four flights

01:50.358 --> 01:51.524
with three layovers.

01:51.559 --> 01:52.892
Oh, yeah, um...

01:52.928 --> 01:55.463
remember how I found that
amazing airline deal online?

01:55.498 --> 01:58.365
Yeah, but two of these
layovers are six hours each.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.267
Yes, but the third one's
only 12 minutes.

02:00.303 --> 02:01.602
But it's at O'Hare.

02:01.638 --> 02:02.903
Honey, we'll have to sprint

02:02.939 --> 02:04.272
from one end of the
airport to the other.

02:04.307 --> 02:06.873
It'll all be worth it when
we wake up on December 27th

02:06.909 --> 02:09.543
in Bermuda,
where the forecast predicts...

02:09.578 --> 02:11.311
hot fog.

02:11.346 --> 02:12.647
Can't we just take a direct flight?

02:12.682 --> 02:14.816
There's no changes,
the terms were very clear.

02:14.852 --> 02:16.918
It was part of a promotion
for a new website

02:16.954 --> 02:18.185
called Tickets.Plane.

02:19.857 --> 02:21.590
Oh, yeah, I have a showing
right down the street.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.157
Okay. Wait, hang on.

02:23.192 --> 02:24.059
Don't leave. Don't leave.

02:24.094 --> 02:26.127
What is Economy Minus?

02:26.162 --> 02:28.797
A plus, actually,

02:28.832 --> 02:30.865
since no one's jealous of
people with aisle seats,

02:30.900 --> 02:34.971
because it's basically two
innovative 18-person benches

02:35.006 --> 02:36.004
facing each other.

02:37.042 --> 02:38.140
Phil?!

02:39.911 --> 02:40.876
What?

02:40.912 --> 02:41.911
Nothing.

02:58.097 --> 02:59.597
Who moved Cam's card?

02:59.632 --> 03:02.398
He's gonna be very upset
if he's not on the mantel!

03:02.435 --> 03:03.800
I put it in a drawer until he gets here.

03:03.836 --> 03:05.368
That glitter was getting on everything.

03:05.403 --> 03:07.670
I breathed some of that in.

03:07.706 --> 03:09.539
I cough gold now.

03:09.574 --> 03:12.376
Gloria, you got a package from Colombia.

03:12.411 --> 03:14.378
Must mean the government
took back the airstrip.

03:14.413 --> 03:18.415
Those are the gifts from my cousins!

03:19.616 --> 03:21.186
Beautiful!

03:21.220 --> 03:25.657
Back home we call these
<i>suéteres de Navidad.</i>

03:25.692 --> 03:27.359
So... Christmas sweaters.

03:27.393 --> 03:30.861
Put them on so we can take a picture.

03:30.897 --> 03:32.796
Wow, these are really soft.

03:32.832 --> 03:34.599
Damn cozy is what they are.

03:34.635 --> 03:37.970
Oh, look,
they also sent a banana leaf wreath.

03:38.968 --> 03:39.971
Banana spider!

03:40.007 --> 03:41.140
- What?!
- What is that?!

03:41.175 --> 03:42.975
It's a deadly spider! It will kill you!

03:43.011 --> 03:43.909
I know what deadly means!

03:43.944 --> 03:44.976
Well, where'd it go?

03:45.012 --> 03:46.112
I'm wearing backless house slippers!

03:46.147 --> 03:46.946
I think it ran over to the...

03:48.915 --> 03:50.950
He took the tree!

03:50.985 --> 03:53.251
Am I the only one who feels kinda itchy?

03:53.286 --> 03:54.499
The sweaters.

03:54.789 --> 03:56.956
Where there's one, there's many!

03:56.992 --> 03:57.757
- Run!
- Let's go!

04:01.030 --> 04:02.561
Dear God, he's got the remote.

04:03.766 --> 04:05.666
Okay, smile!

04:05.701 --> 04:07.299
Can we go look at phones after this?

04:07.335 --> 04:10.036
No, Lily, you are not getting
a cell phone for Christmas.

04:10.071 --> 04:11.704
They're expensive,
and you haven't proven yourself

04:11.739 --> 04:13.974
responsible enough to own one yet.

04:14.008 --> 04:16.841
Uh, I was responsible enough
to come to a foreign country

04:16.878 --> 04:18.278
and build a life with two strangers.

04:18.314 --> 04:20.680
Okay, you used that one to get
a later bedtime, all right?

04:20.716 --> 04:22.549
Oh, Cal, you're next.

04:22.585 --> 04:24.052
Ho, ho, ho.

04:24.087 --> 04:26.587
We want Cal to have a perfect Christmas.

04:26.622 --> 04:28.722
It's tough with his mom being in prison.

04:28.758 --> 04:32.660
Plus, his holiday season kind
of got off to a rough start.

04:32.696 --> 04:35.095
You know, of all
of our wonderful ornament selects,

04:35.131 --> 04:36.431
these are my fave.

04:36.465 --> 04:37.631
Merry Christmas!

04:37.667 --> 04:39.802
From Mitch and Cam!

05:01.025 --> 05:02.625
We barely got through three verses

05:02.661 --> 05:04.928
and a repeat chorus before
we realized our mistake.

05:04.962 --> 05:07.162
- Although that rainstorm came out of nowhere.
- Yeah.

05:07.695 --> 05:09.965
Merry Christmas, little Cal!

05:10.001 --> 05:12.202
Lily, take your cousin over there.
Relax a little.

05:12.236 --> 05:13.102
Okay, go.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.470
- Hi!
- Hi!

05:14.505 --> 05:16.905
Hey, Santa. So, just wondering
if you could you do us a favor

05:16.941 --> 05:20.343
and tell us what our nephew
just asked for for Christmas?

05:20.379 --> 05:21.912
I know you. You're that lawyer.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.413
Oh, no. This is never good.

05:23.449 --> 05:26.016
You're the ADA who charged
me with public intoxication.

05:26.052 --> 05:28.552
Got me sentenced to fifty
hours community service...

05:28.588 --> 05:30.588
working as a mall Santa is part of it.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.490
Okay. Well, I'm sorry.
But can't we move past that?

05:33.526 --> 05:35.826
We really need to know
what our nephew asked for.

05:35.862 --> 05:37.927
He asked for a more
lenient justice system.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.164
Well, I doubt that.
He's pretty conservative.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.933
We have to pretend to be roommates.

05:41.969 --> 05:43.200
Can we move this along?

05:43.236 --> 05:45.202
I only have my kids for
four hours this week.

05:47.483 --> 05:49.248
Merry Christmas.

05:49.764 --> 05:51.084
You know what? As a former mall Santa,

05:51.120 --> 05:53.120
I vowed never to comment
on a sitting Santa,

05:53.154 --> 05:55.087
but you're a disgrace
to the red and white.

05:56.224 --> 05:57.823
Phil, I just got
off the phone with my dad.

05:57.860 --> 05:59.693
We're moving Christmas Eve to our house.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.795
I got to run out and get some groceries.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.129
See you soon. Bye.

06:04.299 --> 06:05.232
Where's the tree?

06:05.268 --> 06:07.035
Where are the gifts?

06:07.069 --> 06:09.970
I assumed you canceled Christmas
because you found out that I...

06:11.273 --> 06:12.506
But I interrupted you.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.174
Did your dad take them to his showing?

06:14.210 --> 06:16.576
He's always doing this...
he steals my decorations

06:16.612 --> 06:18.845
to stage his houses to make them homier.

06:18.881 --> 06:21.115
He swore he would stop doing this!

06:21.151 --> 06:22.517
At least he left the "wreaf."

06:22.553 --> 06:23.584
Wreath.

06:23.620 --> 06:24.920
Eh, I've heard it both ways.

06:24.954 --> 06:26.921
No, I have, too. Doesn't make it right.

06:27.892 --> 06:28.990
What are we supposed to do?

06:29.026 --> 06:31.125
We can't host a Christmas
without a tree.

06:31.161 --> 06:33.027
I thought you weren't allowed
to host Christmas anymore

06:33.064 --> 06:34.029
after last year.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.666
I took a swing at a new
way to prepare turkey.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.566
Well, this is frozen.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.366
No, Dad, you just... you hit a bone.

06:45.402 --> 06:46.801
I saw this on "Top Chef."

06:46.837 --> 06:49.571
They cooked an entire
turkey in one hour.

06:49.607 --> 06:51.107
Luke had some, you're fine.
Aren't you, buddy?

06:52.743 --> 06:53.642
Check on Joe.

07:00.450 --> 07:03.819
Oh, your father isn't answering.

07:03.855 --> 07:05.088
You knew about this, didn't you?

07:05.124 --> 07:06.389
I could tell you were hiding something.

07:10.795 --> 07:12.596
Phil?

07:12.631 --> 07:14.331
Phil!

07:14.365 --> 07:15.331
Ph... Oh!

07:16.334 --> 07:18.201
This theater is totally soundproof,

07:18.237 --> 07:21.937
so no one will hear you yelling at
Jim to pick up his socks, Sandy.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.073
She does get loud.

07:27.679 --> 07:29.447
So, all of this,

07:29.481 --> 07:31.582
plus it's in a great school
dist... rict.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.085
Oh my God,
was this house just robbed?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.952
I told you this was a sketchy area.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.688
I am not going through
another home invasion

07:37.724 --> 07:40.758
with the kids and me banging
on the panic room door.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.629
So, you guys chat, and I'll,
uh, take a minute,

07:43.663 --> 07:45.930
see if I can find a replacement tree

07:45.965 --> 07:48.033
and nine identically wrapped gifts.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.970
It's the perfect way to get
your mom in a good mood.

07:52.006 --> 07:54.172
Think about it...
cupcakes are little cakes

07:54.208 --> 07:56.007
just like babies are little people.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.208
I guess.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.744
I just want this to go well.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.211
I'm in a really good
place with this baby,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.413
and I want my mom to be, too.

08:02.797 --> 08:04.317
She wasn't in the
best mood this morning.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.351
It's Christmas Eve.

08:05.387 --> 08:07.986
She can't stay a Grinch all day.

08:17.389 --> 08:18.401
Thank you.

08:19.146 --> 08:20.337
That was the exterminator.

08:20.361 --> 08:21.791
He is, uh, on his way,

08:21.829 --> 08:24.029
but he's gonna have to tent
the house for a couple of days.

08:24.063 --> 08:26.732
And I'm trying to book us a hotel,
but the call keeps dropping.

08:26.768 --> 08:29.068
Joe, let's go to the backyard.
There's better reception.

08:31.071 --> 08:32.739
Hey, listen. I left something inside.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.340
I need you to get it for me.
This should keep you safe.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.643
Are you crazy? I'm not going
back into that spider's nest.

08:37.678 --> 08:39.011
Fine, I hate them, too.

08:39.047 --> 08:41.813
The problem is,
they're attracted to my musk.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.648
I went to the insect room
at the zoo a while back,

08:43.684 --> 08:45.586
and they all started banging
on the glass like inmates.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.086
What'd you leave in there
that's so important?

08:47.123 --> 08:48.054
It's a medication.

08:48.090 --> 08:50.557
I'm fine, but I didn't tell your mom

08:50.592 --> 08:51.759
'cause I didn't want her to worry.

08:51.793 --> 08:54.093
Can we just stop by a liquor store
and refill your "prescription."

08:54.129 --> 08:56.029
It's a medicine! Look...

08:56.064 --> 08:58.765
I'm sure our hotel has a top notch spa.

08:58.801 --> 09:01.301
One that might add a,
uh, hot stone massage,

09:01.336 --> 09:02.803
an herbal soak...

09:02.837 --> 09:04.370
Do I look like someone
who can be bought?

09:04.407 --> 09:06.408
No, but you do look like
someone who might enjoy

09:06.443 --> 09:08.409
a four-handed Balinese seaweed swaddle.

09:09.779 --> 09:11.478
You son of a bitch.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.650
So, Cal, what did you
and Santa talk about?

09:18.082 --> 09:19.683
It's a secret.

09:19.717 --> 09:20.983
Me, I'd be fine with just cash.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.251
You guys have enough on your plate.

09:22.288 --> 09:24.221
Okay, you're not buying yourself
a phone, all right?

09:24.255 --> 09:25.755
Ooh, Santa's on break.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.891
Okay, Lily, go sit with Cal again.

09:27.928 --> 09:30.060
You guys need me...
maybe throw a please in there.

09:30.096 --> 09:32.130
- Yeah. Hi!
- Hi!

09:32.165 --> 09:33.864
Oh, it really is the most
wonderful time of the year.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.133
- Beautiful.
- Isn't it? So, listen, do you mind if...

09:36.169 --> 09:38.870
Do you think you're the first parents
wanting to take a peek at my scroll?

09:38.905 --> 09:40.237
Better stick something in my bootie.

09:40.272 --> 09:41.606
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm sorry. What?

09:41.641 --> 09:43.641
Cash in the slipper, perv.

09:43.676 --> 09:44.776
Oh. Do you wanna...

09:44.810 --> 09:48.080
Yeah, yeah, I got...
I got, uh... I've got $10.

09:48.114 --> 09:49.547
Thank you.

09:49.584 --> 09:51.016
No, this is just a list of toys.

09:51.051 --> 09:52.584
None of the kids'
names are next to them.

09:52.619 --> 09:54.652
Oh, oh. You know what?

09:54.689 --> 09:56.021
Uh, we'll look
at pictures of Cal in line

09:56.056 --> 09:57.823
and then match the kids up behind him

09:57.858 --> 09:59.291
with the toys on the list.

09:59.326 --> 10:00.692
Okay, so, well, I guess this Asian kid,

10:00.728 --> 10:01.926
he maybe wants the, uh...

10:01.963 --> 10:02.927
There's no time to be
politically correct.

10:02.964 --> 10:03.762
- He wants the calculator.
- Calculator.

10:05.675 --> 10:07.209
- And he wants it bad.
- Yeah.

10:07.244 --> 10:09.744
Wait, does that mean that this little
boy wants the Barbie Styling Head?

10:09.779 --> 10:11.079
Yep, look at the turned-out foot.

10:11.114 --> 10:12.848
- Oh, of course he wants the Barbie Styling Head.
- Hey!

10:12.883 --> 10:14.349
Which means Cal wants...

10:14.384 --> 10:15.316
Hot Wheels!

10:15.351 --> 10:16.951
Okay, okay.

10:16.986 --> 10:17.786
Let's go.

10:17.821 --> 10:19.321
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

10:19.355 --> 10:20.821
Uhh...

10:20.858 --> 10:22.858
Don't worry. They come back.

10:26.497 --> 10:28.197
Please tell me you told Mom and Dad.

10:28.232 --> 10:30.032
No, but we're gonna tell them in song.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.667
Listen to this part.

10:31.702 --> 10:34.404
♪ Soon a baby as cute as us ♪

10:34.438 --> 10:36.873
♪ Will spring forth
from Haley's uterus ♪

10:37.378 --> 10:38.740
I love it!

10:38.777 --> 10:41.778
She's lying. She just wants us to get
it over with so her eczema will go away.

10:41.812 --> 10:43.745
I don't have... Oh, my God!

10:44.915 --> 10:46.649
Okay, you got this.

10:46.683 --> 10:47.783
You're quicker than those things.

10:47.818 --> 10:49.318
- I doubt that.
- You're smarter.

10:49.355 --> 10:50.687
I can't make a web out of nothing.

10:50.722 --> 10:52.956
- Plus, you got a weapon.
- A leaf blower?

10:52.991 --> 10:55.592
Hey, that thing can blow a
Pomeranian through a hedge.

10:55.627 --> 10:57.428
Let's just say little
Mimi from next door

10:57.462 --> 10:59.163
won't be visiting our lawn anymore.

10:59.198 --> 11:00.664
Now hurry up before your mom gets back.

11:01.766 --> 11:04.001
We'll be in constant communication.

11:04.035 --> 11:06.236
Go. Go, go, go.

11:06.271 --> 11:08.005
<i>Keep your head on a swivel.</i>

11:08.039 --> 11:10.441
<i>Head for my bathroom. Remember.</i>

11:10.477 --> 11:12.944
That spider can sense the
subtlest sign of fear.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.579
<i>Something just ran past my foot.</i>

11:22.087 --> 11:23.219
Damn it, the power's out!

11:23.253 --> 11:24.686
Then so am I!

11:24.722 --> 11:26.821
<i>No! You just leveled the playing field.</i>

11:26.858 --> 11:27.890
<i>They have eight eyes.</i>

11:27.925 --> 11:29.290
You only have two.

11:29.327 --> 11:31.094
You just took away their one advantage.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.724
What about their sac of poison?

11:37.028 --> 11:38.027
Okay, I'm in the bathroom.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.163
<i>Good, good. The medication...</i>

11:40.199 --> 11:42.065
is down below in the cabinet.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.835
You want me to reach my hand
into a dark, damp breeding ground?

11:44.870 --> 11:47.637
It's all the way in the
back on the far right.

11:47.672 --> 11:49.672
<i>Just feel around for the jar.</i>

11:49.709 --> 11:51.209
So, skitter my hand back and forth?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.577
That's basically a spider mating dance!

11:57.683 --> 11:59.350
Got it.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.585
Whoa! Ow!

12:00.620 --> 12:02.354
Talk to me, over.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.190
Manny!

12:07.829 --> 12:09.260
Not leaving!

12:09.296 --> 12:11.163
Still shopping!

12:11.198 --> 12:13.298
As if getting robbed wasn't bad enough,

12:13.333 --> 12:14.734
now that we were hosting Christmas,

12:14.769 --> 12:16.903
I had to get a new tree
and gifts into the house

12:16.938 --> 12:18.104
before Claire got home.

12:18.139 --> 12:20.606
Fortunately,
I had a copy of her gift list.

12:20.641 --> 12:23.009
It was eerie how many of these events

12:23.043 --> 12:25.477
were lining up with the plot of
my children's book in progress,

12:25.513 --> 12:27.112
"The Realtor Who Saved Christmas."

12:30.244 --> 12:32.112
- Hello?
<i>- Buddy, I need a favor.</i>

12:32.146 --> 12:33.579
Remember that polar bear wrapping paper

12:33.615 --> 12:35.615
you made us buy so much of
because you can't do math?

12:35.650 --> 12:37.150
- Uh-huh.
<i>- Grab a couple rolls of it,</i>

12:37.184 --> 12:39.386
meet me out in front of
the house in 20 minutes.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.954
We're all out. Mom used the
last of it on this year's gifts.

12:41.990 --> 12:45.525
Damn it! I need a bunch of it.
Where am I supposed to f...

12:45.559 --> 12:47.927

12:47.963 --> 12:50.063

12:50.097 --> 12:52.266

13:07.050 --> 13:08.382
Well, we got what we need.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.318
I'm glad someone's getting
what they want this year.

13:10.353 --> 13:11.651
You know what? Here, take my phone.

13:11.688 --> 13:13.955
If you can get through a day
without losing it, it's yours.

13:20.163 --> 13:22.364
You must've run through some hairspray.

13:22.398 --> 13:23.898
Your boots are like flypaper.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.166
That's why that spray was banned.

13:25.201 --> 13:27.802
Birds were flying over the factory
and getting stuck together.

13:29.105 --> 13:31.072
Hey, wait, wait a second. Wait a second.

13:31.108 --> 13:32.774
This is your medication?

13:32.811 --> 13:34.376
"Good Old Fashioned Elbow Grease?"

13:34.412 --> 13:35.845
I suffer from dry elbow.

13:35.879 --> 13:37.413
That's what I risked my life for?

13:37.448 --> 13:40.649
Supple elbows are heavily
featured in every good power pose.

13:43.607 --> 13:45.075
That's how I got the
cover to <i> Closet World.</i>

13:45.110 --> 13:46.875
I literally elbowed my way to the top.

13:48.302 --> 13:49.879
I booked us a hotel.

13:49.914 --> 13:51.714
Manny, you're sharing a room with Joe.

13:53.217 --> 13:54.018
Fix that.

13:58.691 --> 14:00.156
What are you roasting
on the space heater?

14:00.193 --> 14:02.326
Oh, I threw those cards in the trash.

14:02.361 --> 14:03.827
They got all soggy.

14:03.862 --> 14:05.196
- Even Uncle Cam's?
- Mm-hmm.

14:05.231 --> 14:08.432
You have to save those for seven years,
like tax returns.

14:19.512 --> 14:21.480
- Hello, Phil.
- Oh!

14:21.515 --> 14:22.481
Oh, that's right.

14:22.516 --> 14:23.948
The tree's back where it belongs.

14:23.983 --> 14:25.083
<i>You</i> stole it?!

14:25.118 --> 14:26.517
Oh, no,<i> you</i> did.

14:26.553 --> 14:29.386
Just like you stole my family
of plastic Thanksgiving turkeys,

14:29.423 --> 14:30.889
my inflatable Easter bunny,

14:30.924 --> 14:32.690
and my Uncle Sam piñata,

14:32.726 --> 14:34.826
all for your open houses.

14:34.863 --> 14:39.253
Today was my chance to shed
a very unfair reputation.

14:39.289 --> 14:39.898
Claire...

14:39.934 --> 14:42.767
I put two people in
the hospital one time,

14:42.804 --> 14:44.737
and now I'm a Christmas ruiner.

14:44.771 --> 14:45.938
Fire!

14:45.973 --> 14:48.007
Oh, my God! Get the extinguisher!

14:48.041 --> 14:50.510
Aah! It's Cam's glitter card! I knew it!

14:50.545 --> 14:51.344
Stand back!

14:51.378 --> 14:52.744
Aah!

14:52.780 --> 14:53.713
The tree!

14:53.747 --> 14:54.881
The tree, Phil!

14:54.916 --> 14:56.893
Do the tree, Phil. The gifts!

14:57.720 --> 14:59.920
The... The... Honey...

14:59.955 --> 15:01.421
It's out!

15:01.456 --> 15:04.524
This must be the one Luke and I
used for our jet pack prototype.

15:06.061 --> 15:08.896
You know, we're being crazy.
There is no perfect moment.

15:08.931 --> 15:12.032
We're just going to walk in
there like adults and tell them.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.469
Honey...

15:22.504 --> 15:23.570
It's no use.

15:23.605 --> 15:25.304
It's over, Phil.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.505
The house smells like smoke,

15:26.542 --> 15:27.541
we have no tree

15:27.576 --> 15:30.476
and nine scorched,
yet soaking-wet gifts.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.913
Worst of all,
I have to make Mitchell's day

15:32.947 --> 15:35.315
by telling him we're moving
the party to his house

15:35.350 --> 15:39.654
and I'm on permanent
host probation forever.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.121
Who knows?

15:41.157 --> 15:44.726
Maybe in a couple years they'll
toss me a pity holiday...

15:44.760 --> 15:49.264
"Welcome to my non-alcoholic
Earth Day brunch."

15:50.288 --> 15:51.198
In brighter news,

15:51.234 --> 15:53.867
I am getting on a prop
plane in a couple hours.

15:53.903 --> 15:55.970
Bermuda Triangle's still a thing, right?

15:56.005 --> 15:56.939
Claire.

15:56.973 --> 15:59.007
Honey, I just can't right now.

15:59.043 --> 16:00.141
I'm not in the mood for...

16:03.892 --> 16:06.080
- How?
- Merry Christmas from me.

16:06.117 --> 16:09.718
Did you sneak out earlier and buy
all this stuff to cover your tracks?

16:09.753 --> 16:12.954
Or you can choose to believe
it's a Christmas miracle.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.323
I choose miracle.

16:16.359 --> 16:17.727
Happy holidays!

16:17.762 --> 16:20.095
- Hey!
- Hey!

16:20.132 --> 16:21.830
Thank you for taking over.

16:21.867 --> 16:23.432
- You saved the day!
- Merry Christmas.

16:23.468 --> 16:25.535
Well, you know, it's kind of what I do.

16:25.570 --> 16:26.802
Come on, drinks in the kitchen.

16:26.838 --> 16:28.537
- Yay! All right!
- All right!

16:32.575 --> 16:35.009
Ooh, Manny,
what's up with the noggin bump?

16:35.046 --> 16:35.877
What? Where?

16:36.242 --> 16:36.945
Oh, no.

16:36.980 --> 16:38.947
That looks like a banana spider bite!

16:38.984 --> 16:40.417
It's not a bite, he bumped his head.

16:40.451 --> 16:41.850
No, that looks like a bite.

16:41.887 --> 16:44.854
My sister got bit by a Missouri
Silo Spider... lost a toe.

16:44.889 --> 16:47.856
Happy ending...
she was born with eleven.

16:47.893 --> 16:49.491
Manny, we need to get that checked.

16:49.527 --> 16:50.759
There is an antidote,

16:50.796 --> 16:53.263
but if you have never
been bitten by the spider,

16:53.297 --> 16:54.497
it might kill you.

16:54.532 --> 16:56.099
- Let's go to the car.
- I... Jay.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.566
Stop! He wasn't bitten.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.202
He bumped his head when
he went back in the house

16:59.238 --> 17:01.072
to grab my... medication.

17:02.041 --> 17:02.972
What medication?

17:03.009 --> 17:04.541
Oh, my God, Dad, are you okay?

17:04.577 --> 17:06.376
We're gonna get through this, buddy.

17:06.412 --> 17:08.913
It's an elbow cream that I secretly use

17:08.948 --> 17:10.948
every night after Gloria falls asleep.

17:10.982 --> 17:14.384
You sent our son into the
nest of a deadly spider

17:14.420 --> 17:15.452
for a beauty cream?

17:15.488 --> 17:16.787
It's a medicine

17:16.823 --> 17:20.156
that treats the heartbreaking
condition of dry elbow!

17:20.193 --> 17:22.894
It requires a
veterinarian's prescription

17:22.930 --> 17:25.628
because it's primarily used
on rhinos and elephants.

17:27.067 --> 17:29.968
I see on our march to
become a perfect society,

17:30.002 --> 17:31.536
elbow shaming is still allowed.

17:32.539 --> 17:34.271
I get a little dry sometimes.

17:34.308 --> 17:37.174
Hey! You're just as much a
person as everybody else.

17:37.211 --> 17:39.144
I can't believe that
you're so vain that you...

17:39.179 --> 17:42.647
Wait, is that my Christmas card
stuck on the bottom of your shoe?

17:42.684 --> 17:44.783
And why... why is it singed?

17:44.819 --> 17:46.452
Ugh, you got to be less about the cards.

17:46.488 --> 17:48.120
We all think it.

17:48.155 --> 17:51.357
Didn't you empty a can of powerful
hairspray in the bathroom?

17:52.452 --> 17:53.416
And did you go in there, too?

17:55.922 --> 17:59.522
Fine! I needed something, okay?

17:59.559 --> 18:01.792
But at least I went in myself.

18:01.829 --> 18:04.228
After you offered me $20 and I said no.

18:05.098 --> 18:06.731
Some of us can't be bought.

18:06.766 --> 18:08.199
What did you need?

18:08.234 --> 18:10.769
Whatever it is,
we're gonna get through this.

18:10.803 --> 18:12.704
A night guard.

18:12.739 --> 18:15.240
I didn't want to tell you,
but every night,

18:15.274 --> 18:17.975
I wait for you to fall asleep,
so I put it on.

18:18.011 --> 18:19.945
It's so unattractive.

18:19.980 --> 18:20.913
That's it?

18:20.948 --> 18:24.250
Ith not thex-thee. I look hideouth!

18:24.284 --> 18:26.519
Oh, that really humanizes her.

18:26.553 --> 18:27.686
I don't care for it.

18:30.244 --> 18:32.578
Okay, one of my teeth is loose.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.013
I am begging you to tell them.

18:34.048 --> 18:35.081
That's what this is.

18:35.116 --> 18:36.648
I'm coming down the chimney as Santa,

18:36.684 --> 18:38.283
delighting Joe and Cal.

18:38.319 --> 18:40.119
Mom will see how good he is with kids

18:40.154 --> 18:42.354
and then be super chill
with us being pregnant.

18:42.390 --> 18:43.590
Ugh...

18:44.459 --> 18:45.358
Uh-oh.

18:45.393 --> 18:46.860
I'm stuck.

18:46.895 --> 18:48.261
Okay, everybody, come on, picture time!

18:48.296 --> 18:49.662
In front of the tree, let's go.

18:49.697 --> 18:50.897
Oh, God. Just be quiet!

18:50.933 --> 18:52.565
There you are. Okay, where's Dylan?

18:52.601 --> 18:53.999
Aww, Mom.

18:54.035 --> 18:55.802
What? We need somebody
to take the picture.

18:55.838 --> 18:56.837
Harsh.

18:57.805 --> 18:59.005
What was that?

18:59.041 --> 19:01.475
Don't we always have the fire on?

19:01.510 --> 19:02.776
- No!
- I'm sure we do.

19:02.812 --> 19:05.813
Last year we used it to finish
cooking Claire's turkey pieces.

19:05.849 --> 19:07.281
Jay, go turn it on.

19:07.316 --> 19:08.416
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

19:08.450 --> 19:10.317
Every... Everybody 12 and under, out.

19:10.352 --> 19:13.854
What? Honey, what's going on?

19:14.858 --> 19:15.989
Dylan's stuck in the chimney.

19:17.927 --> 19:18.860
Why?

19:18.894 --> 19:19.994
He's dressed up as Santa.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.361
He was gonna hand
presents out to the kids.

19:21.397 --> 19:22.430
Aww.

19:22.466 --> 19:24.600
Don't tell them now.
I want to be with you!

19:25.702 --> 19:26.468
Tell us what?

19:26.504 --> 19:27.635
Nothing. It can wait.

19:27.670 --> 19:29.270
No, it can't! Please!

19:29.305 --> 19:30.972
My organs are shutting down!

19:31.007 --> 19:32.440
Okay, fine. I...

19:34.577 --> 19:37.045
<i>We</i> have an announcement.

19:40.648 --> 19:42.180
Dylan and I are having a baby.

19:44.687 --> 19:46.219
Are they smiling?

19:46.255 --> 19:48.154
You're pregnant?

19:48.190 --> 19:49.078
Yes.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.292
And w-we're really happy about it.

19:52.327 --> 19:54.761
Why wouldn't you be?

19:54.796 --> 19:55.595
Wow!

19:56.632 --> 19:57.864
Mom?

19:57.900 --> 20:01.701
It's... it's a lot
to process at once, and...

20:05.407 --> 20:07.374
A baby. Unbelievable!

20:08.577 --> 20:12.313
- Congratulations!
- Oh, my gosh! A baby!

20:12.348 --> 20:13.748
Oh, God.

20:13.784 --> 20:16.550
You handled that a lot better
than I did back in the day.

20:17.296 --> 20:18.018
Outside.

20:18.054 --> 20:19.820
- On the inside, I'm you.
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.855 --> 20:21.455
Can somebody save my life?

20:21.490 --> 20:23.324
- Oh, Cam, grab a foot.
- Yep.

20:24.494 --> 20:25.927
God, he's really wedged in there.

20:25.962 --> 20:27.730
Ah, if only we had some
kind of award-winning,

20:27.765 --> 20:29.198
placenta-based lubricant.

20:29.232 --> 20:30.266
Fine!

20:30.300 --> 20:32.701
Here, Dylan, use a little bit of this.

20:32.737 --> 20:35.570
I can't believe a little
Dylan is gonna pop out of you!

20:35.606 --> 20:36.806
What would that even look like?

20:37.404 --> 20:39.107
Oh!

20:42.579 --> 20:44.078
Everybody come on in for the picture!

20:44.115 --> 20:45.315
I'll set the timer.

20:45.349 --> 20:47.584
This is all gonna work out, right?

20:47.618 --> 20:48.885
Definitely. Yeah.

20:48.921 --> 20:51.488
Hang on. Let me get my elbows ready.

20:51.522 --> 20:54.124
