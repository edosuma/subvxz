00:28.465 --> 00:30.944
Dad, are you sure
you're okay to drive at night?

00:30.945 --> 00:31.946
It's night?!

00:31.947 --> 00:33.340
All right, that's it. Pull over.

00:33.341 --> 00:34.577
Now don't you worry.

00:34.578 --> 00:38.319
Just sit back and relax
to the smooth sounds of Tommy

00:38.320 --> 00:40.615
Dorsey's All-White Orchestra.

00:41.651 --> 00:43.956
Son, let this music take you

00:43.957 --> 00:47.167
to a time when girls were girls
and a Hershey bar was

00:47.168 --> 00:48.800
as thick as a phone book.

00:48.801 --> 00:52.129
- I'm sick of this song!
- o/~ Catch a falling star and.... o/~

00:52.173 --> 00:53.503
I don't like this one either...

00:53.504 --> 00:54.868
too optimistic!

00:54.869 --> 00:56.077
Too slow!

00:56.078 --> 00:57.389
Too fast!

00:57.534 --> 00:58.813
No zazz!

00:58.814 --> 01:00.052
Too much zazz!

01:00.053 --> 01:01.347
More boogie!

01:01.348 --> 01:02.391
Less woogie!

01:02.392 --> 01:04.647
My back hurts!
All my friends are dead!

01:11.623 --> 01:12.700
Nice one.

01:12.701 --> 01:13.565
Thanks.

01:13.978 --> 01:16.058
Oh, no, we're gonna die.

01:17.252 --> 01:19.424
Oh, no, we're gonna die.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.112
Oh, no...

01:44.664 --> 01:46.889
Son, call me an ambulance.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.408
And while I'm in the hospital,

01:52.409 --> 01:54.526
you'll have to visit me every day.

01:54.527 --> 01:57.475
And then I'll have to come
live with you while I recover.

01:59.424 --> 02:02.863
Eventually I'll die in your home,
which'll hurt the resale value,

02:02.932 --> 02:04.292
but it'll all be...

02:12.743 --> 02:13.757
Dad?

02:13.915 --> 02:15.878
Dad? Wake up!

02:15.879 --> 02:17.738
Who's... what, who?

02:17.739 --> 02:20.026
Oh, I was having the
most wonderful dream.

02:20.027 --> 02:21.387
I always wake up

02:21.388 --> 02:23.385
just before the good part.

02:23.386 --> 02:25.084
You can just drop me off here.

02:27.932 --> 02:29.457
I'll see you later, honey.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.117
Er, uh, yes?

02:38.118 --> 02:41.022
I'm delivering your Scout
Gal Cookies, Mayor Quimby!

02:41.645 --> 02:43.117
That'll be $30.

02:43.118 --> 02:44.730
For three boxes?

02:44.731 --> 02:46.458
The money helps us
serve the community.

02:46.459 --> 02:48.906
We plant trees, pick up litter,
cut up milk bones

02:48.907 --> 02:51.901
- for old dogs...
- It was rhetorical question.

02:51.902 --> 02:54.005
And I used rhetoric in my answer?

02:54.726 --> 02:56.528
Let's just move on.

02:57.809 --> 03:00.406
27 to the left and open.

03:03.229 --> 03:04.738
Where's all the money?

03:05.513 --> 03:07.358
Why, it's right...

03:07.507 --> 03:10.944
We spent all our money on that
new slogan for Springfield.

03:12.238 --> 03:14.874
Um, what say you
leave the cookies,

03:14.875 --> 03:17.334
and I pay you double next year?

03:17.416 --> 03:20.186
Sir, I didn't get this
"skepticism" merit badge

03:20.187 --> 03:22.046
falling for promises like that.

03:22.204 --> 03:24.730
If you don't give me
those cookies, I'll pass a law

03:24.731 --> 03:27.546
forcing your organization
to accept gay scout leaders.

03:27.547 --> 03:29.293
I would strongly support
that measure.

03:29.294 --> 03:31.179
Just give me those cookies!

03:31.429 --> 03:33.067
- You get it...
- Let go.

03:33.068 --> 03:35.416
This is a low point
for my administration.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.096
No. You give it.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.301
People of Springfield,
our city is broke.

03:41.749 --> 03:43.311
Uh, when you say broke,

03:43.312 --> 03:45.861
do you mean really broke,
or uh, "O.J. Simpson broke"?

03:45.862 --> 03:46.955
Really broke!

03:46.956 --> 03:49.781
I've been reduced to using
this cheap novelty gavel.

03:52.851 --> 03:54.701
Order! Order!

03:54.794 --> 03:56.155
Homer Simpson.

03:56.187 --> 03:59.887
I know a lot of you from church
and the market and such.

03:59.919 --> 04:02.409
And I'm not much for talkin',
but seems to me,

04:02.410 --> 04:05.935
in hard times like these
that we Americans come together.

04:08.068 --> 04:11.931
So I say we roll up our sleeves,
and fake a disaster

04:11.959 --> 04:14.624
to trick the federal government
out of relief money.

04:16.077 --> 04:18.745
Rip off the federal government?

04:18.957 --> 04:21.076
Mmm, I have reservations...

04:21.077 --> 04:22.910
for dinner in five minutes.

04:22.911 --> 04:24.761
So all in favor, say "aye"!

04:24.762 --> 04:26.747
- Aye!
- The "ayes" have it.

04:30.567 --> 04:32.066
Now, when exactly

04:32.067 --> 04:33.994
did the hurricane pass
through your town?

04:34.075 --> 04:35.943
Er, uh, five minutes ago.

04:35.944 --> 04:37.096
You just missed it.

04:37.097 --> 04:39.790
FEMA will help you
rebuild this town.

04:41.325 --> 04:45.626
Your $10 million will arrive
as soon as you submit this form,

04:45.716 --> 04:48.523
and the, uh,
$2,500 processing fee.

04:50.215 --> 04:52.496
And that's how
a fake FEMA official scammed us

04:52.497 --> 04:56.705
out of $2,500.
We are now worse than broke.

04:58.067 --> 05:00.020
Panic not, fellow
Springfielders!

05:00.021 --> 05:02.967
I've gone through the town's
financial records, and it turns out

05:02.968 --> 05:06.144
there are millions
in uncollected city taxes.

05:07.444 --> 05:10.495
We shall collect each
and every back tax owed!

05:10.496 --> 05:12.183
Everyone from...

05:12.571 --> 05:14.965
Comic Book Guy to...

05:15.699 --> 05:16.919
... Milhouse!

05:16.920 --> 05:18.547
No one shall be spared!

05:18.548 --> 05:20.034
Dozens of swindling deadbeats,

05:20.035 --> 05:21.829
as well as this respected reporter

05:21.830 --> 05:24.663
who made an honest mistake,
have paid their back taxes,

05:24.742 --> 05:27.089
leaving only one
outstanding debtor:

05:27.090 --> 05:28.131
country music star

05:28.132 --> 05:31.297
Lurleen Lumpkin,
seen here at the height of her fame.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.150
o/~ Bunk with me

05:33.151 --> 05:35.821
tonight, Kermit o/~

05:35.822 --> 05:37.885
o/~ Bunk with me

05:37.987 --> 05:39.163
tonight... o/~

05:39.164 --> 05:41.370
Uh, really, Lurleen?

05:43.179 --> 05:44.432
Hey, Dad,

05:44.433 --> 05:46.804
that's the singer
you used to manage!

05:46.870 --> 05:48.447
Oh, right.

05:48.578 --> 05:50.634
Dad was Colonel Homer
and he wore that awesome suit

05:50.635 --> 05:52.643
and Lurleen wanted
to bunk his brains out!

05:52.644 --> 05:54.956
But I forget how Mom felt
about it.

05:56.672 --> 05:58.709
Kids, marriage is like a car.

05:58.847 --> 06:01.316
Along the way it has
its bumps and dings,

06:01.356 --> 06:02.952
and this country
can't make one

06:02.953 --> 06:04.726
that lasts more
than five years.

06:04.727 --> 06:06.437
With Lurleen I just

06:06.438 --> 06:09.409
walked past the showroom
and didn't even go inside.

06:09.613 --> 06:12.017
Now let's return
to watching the news.

06:12.145 --> 06:15.253
Ms. Lumpkin owed $50,000
in back taxes.

06:15.254 --> 06:18.194
With penalties, interest and
the celebrity resentment tax,

06:18.195 --> 06:20.672
that sum has grown
to $12 million.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.745
However, she's been missing
for several years,

06:22.746 --> 06:25.525
since her career went
into a downward spiral.

06:25.526 --> 06:27.662
I told her not to go
into one of those.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.723
The entire city
is searching for her.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.904
Not for any reward,
but for the pleasure

06:31.905 --> 06:34.181
of destroying someone
they once admired.

06:34.182 --> 06:36.221
Save some for me!

06:45.676 --> 06:46.865
Got her!

06:48.580 --> 06:49.693
Krusty?

06:49.895 --> 06:52.064
I just want to win
one thing in my life!

06:52.065 --> 06:53.216
It's not real.

06:53.217 --> 06:55.010
Don't you dare ruin
the moment!

06:57.638 --> 06:59.441
Look at those idiots.

06:59.442 --> 07:02.505
I bet Lurleen's a million miles
away right now.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.629
Hey, Homer.

07:03.741 --> 07:06.256
Shh! I'm more wanted
than the last petal

07:06.257 --> 07:08.997
- on a bloomin' onion.
- Don't worry. You can stay with us.

07:08.998 --> 07:10.928
I'm sure Marge will be cool.

07:29.005 --> 07:32.404
I'm taking you to your home,
before you wreck mine!

07:35.033 --> 07:36.575
You live here?

07:38.664 --> 07:40.072
Bye, Marge.

07:42.776 --> 07:45.133
Well, at least she's got a friend.

07:45.161 --> 07:47.555
It's your turn to clean the toilet.

07:48.681 --> 07:49.977
Where is it?

07:49.978 --> 07:51.217
You're holding it.

07:54.701 --> 07:56.009
Get in!

07:56.113 --> 07:57.653
Oh, come on.

07:57.664 --> 07:59.073
Thanks, Marge.

07:59.074 --> 08:01.330
Gee, after all that's passed
between us, I mean...

08:01.331 --> 08:03.519
Well, you're a bigger
woman than I am.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.977
Are you calling me fat?

08:04.978 --> 08:06.309
No, no, no!

08:06.310 --> 08:07.836
I'll just be quiet.

08:10.868 --> 08:13.722
Lurleen, this barbecue
is delicious!

08:13.829 --> 08:15.904
Oh, it's a traditional
Southern recipe:

08:15.905 --> 08:19.056
ketchup, Coca-Cola,
and fricasseed possum.

08:19.796 --> 08:22.366
Just kiddin'.
It's actually chicken.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.941
Well, I think it's wonderful.

08:24.942 --> 08:26.988
My diet starts tomorrow!

08:27.192 --> 08:30.452
Listen, I'm sorry I called you
all those mean things

08:30.453 --> 08:32.903
like... oh, I don't
even remember.

08:32.904 --> 08:35.120
- Confederate degenerate?
- Southern-fried succubus?

08:35.121 --> 08:36.323
Hee-haw ho?

08:37.244 --> 08:39.639
Oh, that's
all right, Marge.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.376
I'm just so grateful
that y'all took me in

08:42.378 --> 08:45.630
- and hid me from...
- Freeze, Patsy Crime!

08:50.266 --> 08:51.920
- Chief, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:51.921 --> 08:53.440
Why'd you jump off the roof?

08:53.441 --> 08:55.723
I just wanted
to be extraordinary.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.607
Your Honor, I would love to pay
the money I owe,

09:00.674 --> 09:03.679
but country music changed,
and I went out of style.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.621
Objection!
Speculating of trends in country music.

09:06.622 --> 09:08.952
- of trends in country music.
- I'm going to allow it.

09:08.953 --> 09:10.368
Lurleen,
the court orders you

09:10.369 --> 09:12.508
to make payments
of a hundred dollars a week

09:12.509 --> 09:15.202
till such time as your music
comes back in style

09:15.203 --> 09:17.858
or becomes appreciated
for its camp value.

09:18.841 --> 09:20.612
All right, what's the next case?

09:20.613 --> 09:22.069
Judge, next we have a man

09:22.070 --> 09:25.162
who is suing his wife
for not dressing sexy enough

09:25.163 --> 09:27.947
in "The Case
of the Horny Husband."

09:27.948 --> 09:29.052
What the...?

09:29.053 --> 09:31.854
Well, I thought if we acted
like The People's Court,

09:31.855 --> 09:34.084
some day we'd
beThe People's Court.

09:34.085 --> 09:37.127
And, uh, well,
a bailiff can dream, can't he?

09:37.128 --> 09:38.936
No, he can't.

09:38.937 --> 09:41.403
I don't get it, Lurleen.
How did you lose all your money?

09:41.413 --> 09:43.527
Did it go up your nose?
Between your toes?

09:43.528 --> 09:44.962
Sadly, no.

09:44.963 --> 09:47.093
Most of my money went
to my ex-husbands.

09:51.699 --> 09:54.600
Boy, you sure have married
a lot of super-hunks.

09:54.601 --> 09:55.724
Well, from now on,

09:55.725 --> 09:58.183
the only thing I'm gonna be
married to is my work.

09:58.184 --> 10:00.629
I've already accepted
"a high-octane job

10:00.630 --> 10:02.821
in the nightlife industry."

10:03.368 --> 10:05.800
All right, I need you to get the
rats outta the jukebox,

10:05.801 --> 10:07.969
and clean the vomit out
of the pool table pockets,

10:07.970 --> 10:09.528
and then you
got the job.

10:09.529 --> 10:12.093
Oh, and you've gotta share
your tips with Manuel,

10:12.094 --> 10:15.014
who's, uh, actually me
with a fake moustache.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.588
Es good job.

10:16.589 --> 10:18.014
You should take it.

10:18.893 --> 10:20.995
Say, Lurleen,
are you Jamaican?

10:20.996 --> 10:23.173
'Cause "Jamaican" me crazy.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.878
That's sweet,
but I'm not lookin' to date.

10:26.004 --> 10:27.216
No, I'm glad you said that.

10:27.217 --> 10:29.889
'Cause you reminded me
that I'm not looking a David.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.384
So... so great.

10:31.385 --> 10:33.450
Hey, Lurleen, I'm going down
to the rock quarry tonight

10:33.451 --> 10:34.896
to throw stones
at the woodchucks.

10:34.897 --> 10:36.376
- Want to come?
- No.

10:36.377 --> 10:37.928
That's okay.
I understand.

10:38.101 --> 10:40.880
Someone's lookin'
at a snake in her mailbox.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.567
She turned down
Lenny and Carl?

10:44.568 --> 10:47.949
That's like someone who doesn't
like hamburgers or hot dogs.

10:47.950 --> 10:50.343
What could make her
hate men like that?

10:52.531 --> 10:56.121
o/~ I was cryin' in my cradle o/~

10:56.264 --> 10:58.881
o/~ When my daddy hopped a train o/~

10:59.616 --> 11:02.412
o/~ He left a hole in my heart

11:02.447 --> 11:04.845
and filled it up with pain o/~

11:04.846 --> 11:08.159
o/~ I know no amount of liquor

11:08.288 --> 11:11.337
will soothe my achin' ticker o/~

11:11.338 --> 11:14.080
o/~ 'Cause the love for my deadbeat daddy o/~

11:14.081 --> 11:16.916
o/~ Is still pumpin' through my veins. o/~

11:20.131 --> 11:21.913
So that's it.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.474
She's been burned by
the most important

11:23.475 --> 11:25.709
man in her life...
her father.

11:25.731 --> 11:28.473
How could a man
just abandon his family?

11:28.474 --> 11:29.934
By which I mean, what is the method

11:30.040 --> 11:32.129
he would use,
and could anyone do it?

11:34.636 --> 11:36.112
Where you going?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.800
Lurleen Lumpkin has
a hole in her heart,

11:38.801 --> 11:40.728
and I'm gonna fill it.

11:41.754 --> 11:45.009
I've talked to over 500 men
named Lumpkin.

11:45.010 --> 11:48.381
Everyone at Lumpkin, Lumpkin
and Rosenthal Associates,

11:48.528 --> 11:52.388
an Asian or Pacific Islander
named Cho Lum Kin...

11:52.552 --> 11:54.593
Good luck
in searchings!

11:54.686 --> 11:57.268
... but still no sign of Lurleen's dad!

12:00.099 --> 12:01.402
Hello.

12:01.486 --> 12:03.165
Are you Royce Lumpkin?

12:03.166 --> 12:04.325
That's right.

12:04.326 --> 12:06.718
The father
of Lurleen Lumpkin?

12:06.719 --> 12:08.119
Lurleen?

12:08.669 --> 12:11.411
I ain't seen my little girl
in 30 years.

12:11.412 --> 12:14.354
She must be what, uh,
12, 13 by now?

12:14.355 --> 12:17.633
She's 34,
and she's having a rough time!

12:17.634 --> 12:19.420
Oh, man.

12:19.421 --> 12:22.045
I better whiskey up
these corn flakes.

12:22.845 --> 12:25.238
She needs to see you right away!

12:25.239 --> 12:26.717
Oh, man.

12:26.718 --> 12:29.384
I better heroin up
this orange juice.

12:40.969 --> 12:44.079
There's only one man
who can hambone like that.

12:47.145 --> 12:48.397
Daddy!

12:50.906 --> 12:53.255
Lurleen?! My goodness.

12:53.318 --> 12:56.503
Why, you're the spittin' image
of your mother's hotter sister!

12:57.259 --> 13:00.234
Royce Lumpkin,
where you been?

13:00.338 --> 13:02.744
I've been a dang fool. That's where.

13:02.745 --> 13:05.172
Can you forgive me, Lurleen?

13:05.173 --> 13:07.908
The way that I immediately
forgave myself?

13:13.981 --> 13:16.256
I can, Daddy!

13:17.944 --> 13:20.185
I made that hug happen!

13:20.369 --> 13:23.112
Wait a minute. He's a deadbeat dad,

13:23.113 --> 13:25.068
and yet, he's getting
as much love as me,

13:25.069 --> 13:27.901
a dad too lazy to run away!

13:29.176 --> 13:31.457
And he has hair! Oh!

13:31.458 --> 13:34.196
Bart, get me my suicide axe.

13:34.197 --> 13:36.124
No suicide axe!

13:36.686 --> 13:38.127
Later.

13:42.805 --> 13:45.535
You know what I like best
about this T-shirt?

13:45.654 --> 13:48.630
I'll always be able to see
your face.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.959
Oh, well, you don't

13:50.963 --> 13:53.521
need a T-shirt
for that, Tootsie Pop,

13:53.581 --> 13:55.905
'cause I ain't ever
gonna leave you again.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.655
- Just sit still in my lap!
- What lap?

14:00.656 --> 14:02.575
Yeah, all I see is
a gut with knees!

14:02.745 --> 14:04.516
Why you little...

14:05.325 --> 14:08.706
Get back here so we can put
our love on a shirt!

14:12.892 --> 14:14.023
What?

14:14.129 --> 14:16.452
Lurleen's daddy
comes back after 30 years,

14:16.453 --> 14:19.573
and he's father of the year.
Why can't I leave for 30 years?

14:19.723 --> 14:22.677
Fine with me.
Look, I packed you a bag.

14:22.726 --> 14:25.626
- it might be cold outside.
- No problem. I bought you a hat.

14:25.627 --> 14:28.796
Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology.

14:28.797 --> 14:32.793
Well, in that case, I'm not going,
and I'm not staying.

14:32.964 --> 14:35.202
And I'll cut my steak
with a spoon,

14:35.219 --> 14:37.752
then take a walk
on the ceiling.

14:40.404 --> 14:43.180
Oh, Daddy, you made me
the happiest girl

14:43.181 --> 14:45.357
on whichever side of
the Mississippi this is.

14:45.441 --> 14:48.576
And last night, I wrote
this song just for you.

14:53.333 --> 14:56.333
o/~ For 30 years you made me cry o/~

14:56.434 --> 14:59.839

Song's over, Dad.

16:04.636 --> 16:07.875
o/~ He's leaving

16:12.775 --> 16:15.443
I'm really worried
about Lurleen.

16:15.444 --> 16:16.924
Yeah, me, too.

16:16.925 --> 16:18.867
Since her father
re-abandoned her,

16:18.868 --> 16:22.373
she's cut the word "pop"
out of all of our foods.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.908
You'd think a house full
of crazy people would be fun.

16:30.909 --> 16:32.726
It's actually really depressing.

16:38.393 --> 16:41.037
Aw, cheer up.
You still got your talent,

16:41.038 --> 16:44.558
and that new song you wrote
is gonna be a really big hit.

16:44.559 --> 16:46.190
Here's a new song
that's rising faster

16:46.191 --> 16:48.513
than a rocket
with a rocket up its butt.

16:48.514 --> 16:50.958
It's from the Dixie Chicks!

16:54.274 --> 16:57.709
o/~ We said some things

16:57.793 --> 17:01.117

o/~ 'Cause free speech needs

o/~ We pledge allegiance

o/~ Please take away

17:14.453 --> 17:16.060
Ooh, that sounds

17:16.061 --> 17:20.258
just like my song,
but how could they have heard...?

17:21.326 --> 17:23.093
- Daddy!
- o/~ America's back o/~

17:23.203 --> 17:26.473

17:49.413 --> 17:51.175
Take it away, Royce!

17:51.176 --> 17:52.934
He wrote this song!

18:03.760 --> 18:05.257
Hey!

18:07.034 --> 18:08.902
If you need me, I'll be...

18:08.903 --> 18:10.823
Oh, who am I kidding?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.953
No one needs me.

18:22.612 --> 18:24.211
Colonel Homer!

18:24.212 --> 18:26.254
And Major Marge!

18:26.255 --> 18:28.847
- Well, I don't...
- Lurleen, you're giving

18:28.848 --> 18:31.197
your dad too much power
over the way

18:31.198 --> 18:32.896
you feel about yourself.

18:32.897 --> 18:35.936
Stop getting your self-esteem
from the men in your life.

18:35.937 --> 18:37.679
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

18:37.680 --> 18:40.372
You're married to a
kind, thoughtful genius.

18:40.373 --> 18:41.961
Uh, yeah...

18:41.962 --> 18:45.118
Marge, my fringes
are knotted again.

18:45.766 --> 18:48.057
There's only one
person in the world

18:48.058 --> 18:50.106
who can tell you
what to do.

18:50.107 --> 18:52.572
And that person
is right here!

18:52.573 --> 18:54.181
Santa Claus?!

18:54.182 --> 18:57.408
No, no, that's just our
old Christmas decorations.

18:58.903 --> 19:01.196
- Me?!
- Yes!

19:01.316 --> 19:04.820
It's time for you
to take control of your own destiny.

19:04.864 --> 19:08.430
You're not a doormat.
You're a door prize!

19:08.431 --> 19:10.062
You're right, Marge.

19:10.063 --> 19:13.965
And remember, you can do anything
you want in the world of country music,

19:13.966 --> 19:16.603
Western wear merchandising
and TV movies.

19:16.717 --> 19:18.686
Regular movies...
don't hold your breath.

19:18.687 --> 19:21.636
But TV movies...
the sky's the limit.

19:21.637 --> 19:25.044
Colonel, you're still my knight
in white polyester.

19:25.045 --> 19:26.864
Ten percent Lycra.

19:26.989 --> 19:28.608
Oh, I noticed.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.229
Congratulations!
That song I wrote you

19:31.230 --> 19:33.711
was so patriotic,
they decided to make it

19:33.712 --> 19:37.257
into a Chevy commercial,
so I, uh, changed a few lines.

19:39.074 --> 19:40.537
I don't know.

19:40.538 --> 19:43.350
You're asking us
to sell out our song. And for what?

19:43.351 --> 19:44.932
Cash money.

19:44.933 --> 19:48.692
- Money? Ooh, we love money!
- Really? That's great!

19:48.793 --> 19:50.339
I'm gonna buy me
a clock radio!

19:52.035 --> 19:53.755
you are a thief!

19:53.756 --> 19:55.891
A dirty, rotten, lowdown...

19:55.892 --> 19:59.035
I think I can say it
better with this.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.884
No, no, no, don't
hit him in the head!

20:01.885 --> 20:03.714
He needs that to
think up our songs.

20:03.715 --> 20:07.601
I'm Lurleen Lumpkin,
and he stole your song from me!

20:07.602 --> 20:08.849
What?!

20:10.808 --> 20:13.532
Okay, maybe I abandoned
my daughter

20:13.533 --> 20:15.572
and stole her song,
but I'm still the most

20:15.573 --> 20:17.686
honorable record producer
y'all have ever met.

20:17.687 --> 20:19.206
Well, he's got us there.

20:19.207 --> 20:21.637
Still, in human terms,
he's deplorable.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.074
Let's make guitar
picks out of him!

20:24.340 --> 20:25.750
No!

20:25.751 --> 20:28.052
I'm droppin' y'all
as clients!

20:29.560 --> 20:32.283
Oh, I can't thank
you guys enough.

20:32.284 --> 20:34.638
Now I'm opening
for the Dixie Chicks,

20:34.772 --> 20:38.264
and I may have just met
husband #4.

20:38.265 --> 20:40.519
Babe, need a hundred
bucks for beer.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.298
Ooh, I think he's a keeper.

20:44.299 --> 20:47.838
Well, you're very welcome, Lurleen.
Of all the women who've hit on Homer

20:47.839 --> 20:50.491
over the years, you're my favorite.

20:52.646 --> 20:55.298
If you ever come
near Homer again,

20:55.299 --> 20:58.495
I'll strangle you
with your own hair extensions.

20:58.624 --> 21:01.022
That's right. I know.
