WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:06.674
<i>With us tonight is
Pastor Jeff Difford</i>

00:06.757 --> 00:09.510
<i>from the First Baptist Church
of Medford.</i>

00:09.593 --> 00:11.178
<i>Thank you
for being here, Pastor.</i>

00:11.262 --> 00:13.389
<i>My pleasure.
So it would appear</i>

00:13.472 --> 00:14.557
<i>that your church's</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:16.934
<i>Halloween Hell House
has stirred up</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:19.061
<i>quite a bit
of controversy this year.</i>

00:19.145 --> 00:20.813
<i>Oh, I wouldn't call it</i>

00:20.896 --> 00:22.148
<i>controversy.</i>

00:22.231 --> 00:23.232
<i>What would you call it?</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:25.818
<i>As you know,
the purpose of a Hell House</i>

00:25.901 --> 00:28.195
<i>is to demonstrate
the wages of sin,</i>

00:28.279 --> 00:30.614
<i>so as to lead people
back to God.</i>

00:30.698 --> 00:31.782
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

00:32.408 --> 00:34.535
<i>But doesn't it
concern you that a lot</i>

00:34.618 --> 00:36.620
<i>of parents were alarmed</i>

00:36.704 --> 00:39.165
<i>at the gruesome scenes
you portrayed?</i>

00:39.915 --> 00:43.419
<i>Once again,
our intentions were pure.</i>

00:43.502 --> 00:45.880
<i>Why don't we take a look
atjust how pure they were?</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:46.964
<i>Let's roll the clip.</i>

00:47.590 --> 00:48.591
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

00:48.674 --> 00:50.092
<i>I need another beer.</i>

00:50.176 --> 00:52.428
<i>Oh, darling, don't you
think you've had enough?</i>

00:52.511 --> 00:54.972
<i>I'll tell you when I had enough!</i>

00:55.056 --> 00:57.767
<i>Whoa! Hey, cowboy,</i>

00:57.850 --> 00:59.661
<i>why don't you put that
down and call it a night?</i>

00:59.685 --> 01:00.853
<i>Don't you tell me
what to do.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:08.652
<i>That's enough, Peg.</i>

01:11.697 --> 01:13.074
Dear Lord.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.076
As you can see,
our last attempt at a Hell House

01:15.159 --> 01:17.703
may have been a tad...
traumatizing.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.288
I thought it was a hoot.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.749
Some of the little ones
peed their pants.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.209
But that wasn't the goal.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.544
A nine-year-old crapped
himself.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.671
Why are you showing me this?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.673
Well, Mary, this year,
we'd like to go

01:29.757 --> 01:31.717
with a more family-friendly
production.

01:31.801 --> 01:34.512
And I thought you'd be the
perfect person to head that up.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.431
Really? Me?

01:37.515 --> 01:39.350
Yes, you. Absolutely.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.353
Gosh, I don't know.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.272
I always felt I had a flair
for the creative arts,

01:45.356 --> 01:47.233
but putting on a
big show like that...

01:47.316 --> 01:49.556
You'll have a sizable budget
and all the help you'll need

01:49.610 --> 01:51.654
constructing sets,
building props,

01:51.737 --> 01:53.864
special effects, makeup.

01:53.948 --> 01:54.948
It does sound tempting.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.283
But, most importantly,

01:56.367 --> 01:58.911
you'll have an opportunity
to bring people to God

01:58.994 --> 02:02.206
by vividly demonstrating
the perils of sin.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.375
Be careful
if you touch on adultery.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.253
Last year,
one of the actors got pregnant.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.586
Thanks, Peg.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.131
So, what do you say?

02:10.214 --> 02:12.216
I already know the first change
I'm gonna make.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.717
Instead of calling it
"Hell House,"

02:13.801 --> 02:15.427
which is a little off-putting,

02:15.511 --> 02:16.554
I'm gonna call it...

02:16.637 --> 02:18.389
"Heck House."

02:18.472 --> 02:19.473
Isn't that great?

02:19.557 --> 02:20.558
That is great.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.934
You don't
really mean that.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.853
Yes, I do.

02:24.895 --> 02:25.896
Oh, I get it.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.231
Happy wife, happy life.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.816
You need to stop talking.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.401
So it's not
gonna be scary?

02:30.943 --> 02:33.195
It will, but without
all the blood and gore.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.072
But I like blood and gore.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.074
Hang on. Y'all are trying
to scare people

02:37.158 --> 02:38.492
into joining the church?

02:38.576 --> 02:40.035
Yeah. But people like

02:40.119 --> 02:41.662
getting scared
on Halloween anyway.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.623
Why not make 'em jump
in the right direction?

02:44.707 --> 02:46.143
Actually, fear has been
a recruiting tactic

02:46.167 --> 02:47.459
used by organized religion

02:47.543 --> 02:49.086
for centuries.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.730
When you add guilt
to keep people in line,

02:50.754 --> 02:53.299
it's an extremely efficient form
of crowd control.

02:53.382 --> 02:57.136
Our religion is based on love,
Sheldon, not fear.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.346
So what happens when people
don't follow the rules?

02:59.430 --> 03:00.639
They burn in hell.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.436
Because God loves 'em.

03:08.063 --> 03:11.066
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

03:11.150 --> 03:13.777
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

03:13.861 --> 03:16.363
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

03:16.447 --> 03:18.699
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

03:18.782 --> 03:22.578
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

03:35.883 --> 03:37.176
Sheldon.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.677
Oh. Hi, Georgie.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.804
Why was Veronica
Duncan hugging you?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.848
I'm tutoring her
in trigonometry.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.725
And that gets you hugs?

03:44.808 --> 03:46.977
Thanks to me,
she got her first C-minus.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.313
Just between us,
she's a little slow.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.898
That's not what I heard.

03:50.981 --> 03:51.982
What did you hear?

03:52.066 --> 03:53.567
Is she secretly clever?

03:53.651 --> 03:55.945
Because if she is,
I completely missed it.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.071
It doesn't matter.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.590
You just need to
introduce me to her.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.740
Why?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.867
I want to be her friend.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.011
Well, you better take a number.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.870
She's friends with a lot of boys
around here.

04:04.954 --> 04:07.915
Let me worry about that.
You just need to introduce us.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.291
All right.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.977
You know, she pays me
two dollars for every one

04:11.001 --> 04:12.294
of our tutoring lessons.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.213
How much did it cost
her to get a C-minus?

04:14.296 --> 04:16.048
$26.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.298
That's a good deal.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.385
<i>Now, remember,
next week, we start our work</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:20.928
<i>on</i> Streetcar Named Desire.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.930
So please prepare a monologue

04:23.013 --> 04:24.890
for either Blanche
or Stanley.

04:24.974 --> 04:27.893
Usually, the girls do Blanche
and the boys do Stanley,

04:27.977 --> 04:30.896
but no judgment...
you follow your heart.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.403
Thank you again for letting me
come by to pick your brain.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.488
Oh, please.
Anything for the church.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.990
Are you a religious man?

04:41.657 --> 04:42.908
I'm an actor.

04:42.992 --> 04:45.411
I'm whatever
you need me to be.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.620
All right.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.330
As I told you on the phone,

04:48.414 --> 04:49.665
I have been tasked

04:49.748 --> 04:52.334
with mounting this year's
Halloween production.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.503
Oh, is that a haunted house
kind of deal?

04:54.586 --> 04:57.214
Yes, but with the goal
of bringing people to God.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.717
I do know something
about that.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.803
When I played Puck
in <i>Midsummer,</i>

05:02.886 --> 05:06.515
the <i>Tulsa Herald</i> called
my performance "heavenly".

05:06.598 --> 05:08.225
Wow! Good for you.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.477
Thank you, thank you.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.355
Okay. Um, I was hoping

05:13.439 --> 05:15.983
to put on a little play
in each of the rooms

05:16.066 --> 05:18.777
that portrays one
of the seven deadly sins.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.405
Pride, envy, gluttony, lust,
sloth, wrath and greed!

05:21.488 --> 05:23.407
Wow, you know your sins!

05:23.490 --> 05:25.492
Well, again, I'm an actor.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.079
They are the tools in my box.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.790
Um, have you
considered

05:31.874 --> 05:34.001
a narrator, you know, um,

05:34.084 --> 05:36.086
like, a tour guide
kind of thing?

05:36.170 --> 05:37.880
Oh, that's interesting.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.423
But who would that be?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.425
Well, I'd have to think
the big man himself.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.053
- God?
- Satan.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.722
Oh! That's spooky.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.808
And he's trying
to lure people toward sin.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.018
Exactly.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.519
That's a pretty big role.

05:52.603 --> 05:53.937
I wonder who could do it.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.814
Huh.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.274
Well, it would
have to be someone

05:57.358 --> 06:02.237
with enough range
to convey sincerity and charm,

06:02.321 --> 06:05.699
all the while, hiding
a dark and corrupt soul!

06:07.159 --> 06:08.452
Good golly.

06:08.535 --> 06:12.039
If you were just a little
taller, you'd be perfect.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.374
I have lifts.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.379
What are we doing here?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.255
Waiting for Veronica.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.566
How do you know she's in there?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.008
It's kind of her homeroom.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.761
Oh, hello again.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.347
Oh.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.431
Hey. What's up?

06:30.265 --> 06:32.476
This is my brother Georgie.
He wanted to meet you.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.854
- Really?
- Really.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.148
I like your hair.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.401
Uh, me, too.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.617
What do you think?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.285
Pretty great, huh?

06:50.369 --> 06:52.454
Realtor's letting us
use it for free.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.540
Wow. How'd you swing that?

06:54.623 --> 06:55.624
Well, I promised

06:55.707 --> 06:57.876
Fred Murphy a lead role
in the lust room.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.212
Ooh.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.214
Look at you,
just wheeling and dealing

07:02.297 --> 07:04.633
like a big-time
Hollywood producer.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.136
Maybe you're
in the wrong business.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.262
Being a mother?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.180
- Being a Christian.
- Ah.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.682
Greetings!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.684
Oh, good! Mr. Lundy, you made it.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.954
Oh, we're gonna be working
together. You can call me Gene.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.647
All right, Gene, this
is my mother, Connie.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.689
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.775
Now, I would've bet
she was your big sister.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.361
I thought you said
he was a good actor.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.946
Oh, now.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.281
So, what do you think?

07:27.364 --> 07:30.159
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.327
- Spiderwebs.
- What?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.246
We're gonna need some spiderwebs,
and I think

07:34.329 --> 07:35.914
maybe some fire effects
on the left

07:35.998 --> 07:37.541
and right side
of the portal.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.085
- Portal?
- Portal to hell.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.962
Sure, sure.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.548
Now, the script calls for me
to appear

07:44.631 --> 07:46.675
from beneath the house
in a cloud of smoke.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.136
But I think
that's gonna be ambitious.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.679
Script? What script?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.598
Oh, I wrote a script.
Don't worry about it.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.725
I was gonna write the script.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.727
Well, now you don't have to.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.609
Do you believe this?

08:03.692 --> 08:04.985
Believe it, love it,

08:05.068 --> 08:07.112
glad I didn't wait
in the car.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.082
I can't believe this.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.752
- No good?
- It's awful.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.254
It makes sin
seem like a good thing.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.698
Well, that's the problem,
isn't it?

08:25.756 --> 08:27.275
I mean, if sin didn't seem
like a good thing,

08:27.299 --> 08:28.467
nobody would do it.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.761
George, please, I'm in no mood.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.095
Hey. Wrath.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.347
That's one of the seven sins,
right?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.616
Pastor Jeff gave me this project

08:35.640 --> 08:37.392
because he knew
I'd be best at it.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.729
Now Gene... Lundy
is taking over.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.563
Oh, look, pride. And envy.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.942
Don't stop. Four sins to go.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.197
I'm guessing lust
ain't happening tonight.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.829
You see a large red button.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.623
What do you do?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.000
I press it.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.588
The floor opens up
and you plunge into a 60-foot pit.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.423
I fly out.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.551
Up, up, and away!

09:10.634 --> 09:13.262
Again, you're not Superman
in this game.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.389
You're Superman for Halloween.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.099
Which isn't till next week.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.559
So I'm in a pit.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.851
You're in a pit.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.855
Then I blast my way out
with my super breath!

09:25.732 --> 09:27.150
Just let him do it.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.610
Dinner's ready.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.320
- Five more minutes.
- Hey, Georgie.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.573
I saw you talking
to Veronica Duncan.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.242
- Yeah. So?
- How well do you know her?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.160
Not as well as I'm gonna.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.495
I introduced them.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.080
He math skills are dreadful.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.957
Did you know Superman
has a dog?

09:42.499 --> 09:43.709
His name is Krypto.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.837
He plays fetch in space.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.006
<i>♪♪ Please allow me

09:49.089 --> 09:53.468
Cut. Cut. Cut.
Cut. Cut.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.137
This is supposed to be wrath.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.848
<i>♪♪ I've been around

09:57.931 --> 09:58.932

10:01.268 --> 10:02.620
Give him a little kick

Give him a little kick.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.147
<i>♪♪ I was 'round ♪♪</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:07.274
That's right,

10:07.357 --> 10:08.692
Yes. Yeah.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.985
No, go for it.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.445
Yes.

10:21.872 --> 10:24.708
Kind of stomp down on him,
stomp down on him.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.377
Yes. That's the way. Good.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.920
Now, Fred, remember,

10:29.004 --> 10:33.050
you are the
personification of lust.

10:33.133 --> 10:37.512
Your sole reason for being
is to try to satisfy

10:37.596 --> 10:41.808
this unquenchable thirst
for physical pleasure.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.646
Great. Will there be
kissing and touching?

10:45.729 --> 10:48.065
- Oh, you bet.
- Mm. Mm.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.192
Now what?

10:50.275 --> 10:52.944
Pretend kissing.
Pretend touching.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.613
Oh.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.157
Fred, would you just
give me a moment?

10:57.741 --> 11:00.452
Mary, I... I've tried
to be patient,

11:00.535 --> 11:01.995
but if I'm gonna do this,

11:02.079 --> 11:04.456
put my reputation
on the line,

11:04.539 --> 11:07.209
I'm gonna need you
to back off just a little bit.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.212
Do I need to remind you
that the purpose of <i>Heck House</i>

11:10.295 --> 11:12.547
is to show how sins
destroy our lives?

11:12.631 --> 11:13.757
Yeah, so?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.385
You are making them
into a good thing.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.970
Have you read the script?

11:19.554 --> 11:20.847
He's gonna get syphilis.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.474
He goes home,
he gives it to his wife.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.975
She goes crazy.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.395
She kills him
and her entire family.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.021
What am I missing?

11:28.105 --> 11:29.690
Sorry I'm late.

11:29.773 --> 11:30.857
I couldn't find my keys,

11:30.941 --> 11:32.776
and then my car
wouldn't start.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.194
Then I got lost.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.779
Holy smokes.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.156
Hi. Are you
my makeout partner?

11:40.117 --> 11:42.577
No. No. No one's making out.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.287
This all stops right now.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.331
You have got to calm down.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.643
I will not have innocent
children walk through this house

11:48.667 --> 11:50.794
on Halloween
and see a half-naked woman.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.463
A half-naked woman
chock-full of syphilis.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.299
- What?
- It's pretend syphilis.

11:57.718 --> 12:01.012
Mary, I am a trained
theater professional.

12:01.096 --> 12:06.309
Why don't you just let me
do what I do, while you,

12:06.393 --> 12:10.814
you know, go home and make
a nice tuna casserole.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.983
Hmm?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.067
All right, Fred...

12:14.151 --> 12:16.278
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

12:16.361 --> 12:17.779
<i>She's going to tear
his throat out.</i>

12:17.863 --> 12:20.073
<i>But what in fact happened
is she did</i>

12:20.157 --> 12:21.700
<i>what she thought Jesus
would do.</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:24.286
<i>She went home and made
that tuna casserole.</i>

12:24.369 --> 12:25.412
<i>It was a little salty</i>

12:25.495 --> 12:28.165
<i>but I ate it
because she was in a mood.</i>

12:31.001 --> 12:33.628
Trick or treat!

12:47.684 --> 12:51.521
Greetings.
Pleased to meet you.

12:51.605 --> 12:55.192
I go by many names:
Satan, Lucifer,

12:55.275 --> 12:58.695
Mephistopheles,
Beelzebub.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.499
Of course, when I make
a dinner reservation,

13:00.530 --> 13:03.033
I... I go by "Eric."

13:03.116 --> 13:04.493
It's easier to spell.

13:05.744 --> 13:09.456
Before we begin
tonight's descent into Heck,

13:09.539 --> 13:12.375
I'd like to tell you
a little about myself.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.504
'Cause it's all about you,
isn't it?

13:15.587 --> 13:18.215
I was God's chosen angel.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.383
I was his favorite.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.552
We used to go camping together.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.223
But then, because I wanted
to have a little bit of fun,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.975
I was cast from heaven.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.895
Tonight, you will bear witness
to that fun.

13:31.978 --> 13:37.067
You will decide
whether it is sinful...

13:37.150 --> 13:39.027
or just another Saturday night.

13:39.110 --> 13:43.448
Come with me... if you dare.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.577
Just watch your step
right over here,

13:47.661 --> 13:49.579
'cause there's some
electrical wires.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.124
Trick or treat.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.836
Oh, look how cute y'all are.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.964
Now, I know you are Superman.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.632
What about the rest of you?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.301
- I'm Cyndi Lauper.
- I'm a wizard.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.427
Uh-huh.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.221
And I'm Carl Sagan.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.056
Who?

14:08.139 --> 14:09.474
Carl Sagan.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.643
He's the host of <i>Cosmos.</i>

14:12.644 --> 14:14.271
Well, isn't that something.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.231
Now, y'all be safe
and have a fun night.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.524
I'm Super...

14:23.905 --> 14:25.323
Do you like Guns N' Roses?

14:25.407 --> 14:27.158
They're all right.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.743
Yeah, they're all right.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.669
You as smart
as your brother?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.629
Nobody is.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.007
I got an older sister
that's kind of a genius.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.466
Oh, yeah?

14:43.550 --> 14:44.718
Why didn't she tutor you?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.553
She's in jail.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.263
What'd she do?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.849
She sold a piñata
full of weed

14:50.932 --> 14:52.475
to an undercover cop.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.811
Doesn't sound like
much of a genius.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.440
Oh, I don't know,
she graduated high school.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.191
<i>Ooh, peanut butter cups!</i>

15:00.275 --> 15:03.028
<i>Superman loves
peanut butter cups!</i>

15:05.030 --> 15:07.532
So you see, the sin of greed.

15:07.616 --> 15:10.869
A very wealthy man,
a beautiful house,

15:10.952 --> 15:13.371
swimming pool,
several German cars,

15:13.455 --> 15:16.750
and a young wife
who worshipped him.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.418
Excuse me, Mr. Satan.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.879
What?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.130
You kind of left out

15:22.213 --> 15:23.757
how greed is the root
of all evil,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.258
and how it corrupts
the soul.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.469
It's in there.
It's called subtext.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.513
Why don't we take a gander
at the eternal torment

15:30.597 --> 15:31.681
that is sloth.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.686
I can't believe
no one in this town knows

15:36.770 --> 15:38.229
who Carl Sagan is.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.981
Why even have a TV?

15:40.065 --> 15:43.193
Stupid Mrs. Gifford
gave me a banana.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.111
Where's Billy?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.529
He had to go
to the bathroom.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.448
- So he went home?
- No.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.408
He's right behind
that tree.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.661
Wait up, guys.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.205
Oh, I got a little on my cape.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.998
Ew.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.675
There's nobody at my house.
You want to come over?

16:06.758 --> 16:07.968
Yes.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.678
Okay, let's go.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.397
Look at this.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.650
We threw a party for heaven
and nobody came.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.987
Not one person
chose to be saved.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.822
Well, did you tell 'em
about the cupcakes?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.240
Where I think you went wrong

16:30.323 --> 16:31.449
is in your timing.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.786
If you'd done this deal
during a war or a plague,

16:34.869 --> 16:36.788
then you'd have
a boatload of converts.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.498
Famine.
Famine would bring 'em in.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.500
What do you know about famine?

16:41.710 --> 16:43.294
Hola, amigos.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.714
Hey, Pastor Jeff.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.091
Why so glum?
This is going great.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.510
Donations are through the roof.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.179
Nobody wants to be saved.

16:53.263 --> 16:57.100
Yeah, but donations
are through the roof.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.561
Is that all this means to you,
raising money?

16:59.644 --> 17:02.188
Hey, that money
is gonna do a lot of good

17:02.272 --> 17:03.565
for a lot of people.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.358
Now, quit being
such a fun sponge.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.569
Here, have some grapes.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.785
What's that?

17:15.868 --> 17:19.164
Some stupid haunted house
my mother's doing for the church.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.165
Let's check it out.

17:21.249 --> 17:23.792
But I... I thought we were
going to your house.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.212
We are.
Let's just do this first.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.714
Come on.
It'll be fun.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.221
Pleased to meet you.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.349
I go by many names:
Satan...

17:38.433 --> 17:40.852
<i>My mother's fears that
no one would be saved</i>

17:40.935 --> 17:43.396
<i>that Halloween night
were proven incorrect.</i>

17:43.480 --> 17:45.815
As they kissed,
she thought about the choices

17:45.899 --> 17:47.984
that led her to this moment.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.321
<i>Mr. Lundy's scene about
lust made a deep impact</i>

17:51.404 --> 17:54.282
<i>- on my brother's date.</i>
- Her youth was gone.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.367
She had traded her
beauty for a few

17:56.451 --> 18:01.039
tawdry dollars, and now she had
nothing left but shame...

18:02.832 --> 18:05.001
...and venereal disease.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.134
<i>She asked to be saved by Jesus.</i>

18:13.218 --> 18:15.762
I don't want to live
like this anymore.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.848
Oh, just repeat after me...

18:18.932 --> 18:21.184
<i>And as it turns out, she was.</i>

18:21.267 --> 18:23.520
<i>She went on to live a life
devoted to God,</i>

18:23.603 --> 18:26.356
<i>feeding the poor,
even helping her sister</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:29.359
<i>start a literacy program
for female prisoners.</i>

18:31.361 --> 18:33.481
<i>My brother, on the other hand,
became a devout atheist</i>

18:33.530 --> 18:35.281
<i>after that night.</i>

18:36.032 --> 18:37.909
We got one!

18:41.496 --> 18:43.123
Trick or treat.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.333
Aren't y'all precious.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.503
And you look like
a little Carl Sagan.

18:48.586 --> 18:53.925
<i>Vindication,
the sweetest candy of all.</i>
