got attacked by a bear.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.830

Yeah.

Big Stinky.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.960
The nastiest skunk
in Moose Rump.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.710
Two years ago he fumigated
the whole camp with his

03:17.330 --> 03:19.120
Yeah, parents love me.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.000
Heck, Xander's dad calls me
the son he never had!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.830
It's the way Xander
runs, right?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.830
You don't understand.

03:27.830 --> 03:32.460
I lied and told my mother
that this is a camp for
the gifted and talented.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.250
Gifted and talented?

03:34.250 --> 03:36.710
Jorge thinks one of the
planets is named "Melvin."

03:38.380 --> 03:39.620
I know!

03:39.620 --> 03:42.170
Look, if she finds out this
camp isn't full of geniuses,

03:42.170 --> 03:43.920
I'm going to be
in big trouble.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.830
Well, you know how I feel
about bending the truth.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.000
You love it.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.540
Exactly.

03:49.540 --> 03:52.000
So, we can just
pretend to be
geniuses for one day.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.040
(SCOFFS) Like you could
pull that off!

03:54.040 --> 03:55.120
Huh.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.500
I mean, thank you!

03:57.500 --> 03:59.380
But are you guys
brilliant at...

03:59.380 --> 04:00.380
Anything?

04:00.380 --> 04:03.330
Well, I created a whole
line of dog makeup.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.210
It takes the ugg
out of your pug.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.540
I'm great at finding
loopholes in banking laws.

04:10.540 --> 04:14.080
And I can play a pretty mean
Yankee Doodle Dandy
with my armpits.

04:15.620 --> 04:16.670
I'm doomed.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.960
I just know he's down there.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.250
My nose hairs are wilting!

04:23.420 --> 04:25.710
What if it's
not Big Stinky?

04:25.710 --> 04:27.420
What if it's
a dead body?

04:28.290 --> 04:30.540
I bet it's Nosy Nancy.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.750
Gladys said she left camp to
see her parents,

04:32.750 --> 04:34.330
but I think it's because
she knew too much.

04:36.420 --> 04:40.210
Okay, we have to gently
lure him out, and coax him
back into the woods.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.000
Got it!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.250
Hey, you're not gonna
hurt him, are you?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.080
Well, I didn't grab this
shovel to tickle him.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.420
Just don't get him angry,

04:49.420 --> 04:51.170
'cause when skunks get
angry, they...

04:51.170 --> 04:52.170
Skunk!

04:54.330 --> 04:55.750
(YELLING)

05:02.080 --> 05:06.000
Okay, if we want my mother
to believe this is a
camp full of geniuses,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.880
we have to put
these glasses on.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.290
Isn't that kind
of stereotypical?

05:09.290 --> 05:10.620
You don't even wear glasses.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.380
In front of my mother I do!

05:12.380 --> 05:16.460
She says, "If your eyes
aren't ruined, you're
not reading enough."

05:16.460 --> 05:21.380
Now, here are some "do's"
and "don't's" for when my
mother, Dr. Chen, gets here.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.670
When you say "yes,"
put a "ma'am" behind it.

05:23.670 --> 05:25.880
And also when you
say "no," right?

05:25.880 --> 05:29.250
I don't know.
I've never said that
word to my mother.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.790
Wow. She sounds like
a human splinter.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.120
TIFFANY: Now, for some
"don't's." "Don't" look down
when you speak to her,

05:36.120 --> 05:37.960
she takes it as
a sign of weakness.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.580
But don't look her
in the eye, either.

05:39.580 --> 05:42.250
She sees that
as a challenge
to her dominance.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.790
That's funny, Tiffany's mom
has the same rules
as Mrs. Kipling.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.250
(KNOCKING)

05:47.250 --> 05:48.460
Oh, she's here!

05:48.460 --> 05:49.380
Quick, everybody...

05:49.380 --> 05:50.420
Be smarter!

05:55.880 --> 05:57.330
Hello, Mother.
Daughter.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.750
Salutations, genius campers.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.330
I made you some brownies,

06:02.330 --> 06:05.000
as I understand that
is a thing people do for
occasions like this.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.500
Thank you, ma'am...

06:08.330 --> 06:09.710
Doctor...

06:09.710 --> 06:10.750
Doctor ma'am.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.210
Hey, these are delicious!

06:14.210 --> 06:16.210
And they're shaped
like dodecahedrons.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.620
I thought that would
make them more...

06:18.540 --> 06:19.670
Fun.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.250
I see where you get
your definition of fun.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.830
Mother, when did
you learn to bake?

06:26.830 --> 06:27.920
Yesterday.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.330
I whipped these up in the lab.

06:29.330 --> 06:33.420
The heat from the depleted
uranium baked them in no time.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.500
On the bright side, Tiffany
won't need a night light
tonight,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
because we'll all be glowing.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.420
Well, it is very pleasing to
know my daughter gets to spend
her summer in the company

06:41.420 --> 06:43.620
of fellow young geniuses.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.920
That's right! We're geniuses
with a capital J.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.290
Ha! Humor.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.420
And what is your area
of expertise, young lady?

06:52.420 --> 06:53.380
Let me show ya.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.210
You like Yankee
Doodle Dandy?

06:55.210 --> 06:57.000
A-one, and a-two...
No, don't!

06:58.330 --> 06:59.460
Uh...

06:59.460 --> 07:01.580
Don't spoil it.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.500
Mother, they'll show
you how brilliant
they are later.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.170
For now, why don't
you go freshen up?

07:06.170 --> 07:08.080
Oh, good idea!

07:08.080 --> 07:11.330
I still have some cocoa powder
and radioactive isotopes
underneath my fingernails.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.540
It burns.

07:21.500 --> 07:26.380
Okay, Xandy, let's get this
in all those hard
to sauce places.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.330
You're on your own.

07:29.330 --> 07:31.670
I just can't believe
Big Stinky got me again.

07:31.670 --> 07:32.960
Wait...

07:32.960 --> 07:35.120
Big Stinky is back?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.750
We gotta get rid
of that thing!

07:36.750 --> 07:38.460
Why don't you ask
it out on a date?

07:39.790 --> 07:41.210
Very funny.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.250
Plus, I already have a
boyfriend, right Xandy?

07:44.250 --> 07:46.250
Nope.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.920
I actually thought Big Stinky
was kinda cute.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.580
You wouldn't think he was
cute, if you had been there a
couple of years ago.

07:52.330 --> 07:53.540
We got massacred.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.420
It was June.

07:57.420 --> 07:58.920
A night
like every other.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.330
Or so we thought...

08:03.000 --> 08:04.290
There was a campfire.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.920
S'mores.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.290
Laughter...

08:11.420 --> 08:14.000
XANDER: Little did we know,
Big Stinky was out there.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.330
Watching.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.540
Waiting.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.330
Hunting.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.330
(SQUEAKING)

08:23.380 --> 08:24.290
Skunk!

08:25.500 --> 08:26.920
(ALL SCREAMING)

08:29.380 --> 08:31.420
XANDER: Poor, sweet, Lou.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.620
She was the first to fall.

08:33.620 --> 08:36.920
She got hit in the mouth with
a toxic keister cocktail.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.170
(YELPS)

08:43.790 --> 08:45.540
No... Oh!

08:49.460 --> 08:52.250
XANDER: They say a skunk has
cold, dead, eyes.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.210
That's a lie.

08:55.210 --> 08:58.670
There was joy
in Big Stinky's eyes.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.750
He knew what
he was doing.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.120
And he was proud of it.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.420
By the time that skunk
ran back into the woods,

09:06.420 --> 09:08.420
we had
lost two counselors.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.080
Big Stinky killed them?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.420
No, they quit.

09:12.420 --> 09:15.250
But a part of each of us
did die that night.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.170
Look, we gotta get
rid of that skunk.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.830
I say we trap him and take
him all the way to Canada!

09:20.830 --> 09:22.460
What did Canada
ever do to us?

09:22.460 --> 09:23.580
They're too polite.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.000
They're up to something.

09:28.330 --> 09:31.500
I'm excited to see your gifted
colleagues perform.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.380
Almost as excited as
when I created that black
hole in the lab.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.750
Still haven't found
Dr. Jansen.

09:38.750 --> 09:43.000
But if he comes back,
I bet he'll have some
fun stories to tell.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.330
Meanwhile, while we set up,
here's a crossword puzzle
in hieroglyphics.

09:46.330 --> 09:47.330
Ooh!

09:48.880 --> 09:53.000
One across is Ra,
the sun god, obviously!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.500
And I did that without
my Rosetta Stone.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.830
Okay, guys, my mother leaves
tonight.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.290
So we'll get through this
demonstration
of your "genius,"

10:00.290 --> 10:01.960
if you just stick to the plan!

10:01.960 --> 10:05.330
Tiffany, have you ever
thought about just telling
your mom the truth?

10:05.330 --> 10:08.750
Have you ever thought about
cutting off your finger and
sticking the bone in your eye?

10:10.330 --> 10:12.330
No, but I'm really
concerned that you have.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.330
First up, is our piano
prodigy, Lou.

10:20.330 --> 10:21.790
Just press play
on the keyboard.

10:21.790 --> 10:24.540
I have the song
pre-programed.

10:24.540 --> 10:29.290
And now, for a classical piece
by every chicken's favorite
musician, Bach.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
Bach, Bach, Bach!

10:37.500 --> 10:40.380
Wow, Tiffany, this actually
may work.

10:40.380 --> 10:41.460
Woo hoo!

10:41.460 --> 10:42.540
Stand "Bach"...

10:42.540 --> 10:44.290
Here comes treble!

10:46.580 --> 10:48.960
Oh, no...
Lou is going rogue.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.920
Come on, Dr. Chen,
get your groove on.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.040
Raise the roof!

10:56.540 --> 10:59.460
Look, I can't believe my
mother is raising the roof

10:59.460 --> 11:01.460
without calling in a
structural engineer!

11:06.920 --> 11:09.670
Okay, well, ah, this is
clearly a remix.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.920
Thank you, Lou.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.040
Kids today
and their crazy music.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.500
(BELL RINGING)

11:22.500 --> 11:26.500
Huh, Big Stinky took the bait.
But he's not here.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.170
He's close.
(SNIFFS)

11:28.170 --> 11:29.290
I can smell him.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.540
Big Stinky!

11:37.540 --> 11:39.290
No!

11:39.290 --> 11:41.000
Griff!

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Skunk! Everybody, get
off of the lawn!
Get off of the lawn!

11:43.710 --> 11:46.380
(ALL SCREAMING)

11:48.000 --> 11:49.670
All smell has broken loose!

11:51.750 --> 11:54.120
See? The more money
you put in,

11:54.120 --> 11:58.380
the higher you'll climb
on my patented triangle
of success!

11:58.380 --> 12:03.120
One question, isn't that
clearly an illegal
pyramid scheme?

12:03.790 --> 12:04.790
What are you, a cop?

12:09.670 --> 12:11.500
TIFFANY: Okay!

12:11.500 --> 12:14.080
Let's move onto our
chemistry genius, Emma.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.290
Do you remember how to
pronounce the chemicals and
what order to mix them in?

12:17.290 --> 12:19.790
Yes! And the order is
blue, yellow, green.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.290
Although those colors
really clash...

12:21.290 --> 12:23.250
It doesn't matter.
It's science, not fashion.

12:25.710 --> 12:31.170
Today, I will be demonstrating
a three layer color experiment
using dee-eth...

12:32.290 --> 12:34.790
Dy-chrom...

12:35.500 --> 12:36.960
Hydro...

12:36.960 --> 12:38.080
Planing?

12:39.290 --> 12:41.420
Chemicals!

12:41.420 --> 12:43.250
English is Emma's
second language.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.620
She only knows
two languages?

12:44.620 --> 12:46.460
How did she get
into this camp?

12:46.460 --> 12:48.040
She's rich. Money talks.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.290
And speaking of money...

12:50.290 --> 12:52.420
Did you by any chance bring
your check book?

12:54.620 --> 12:56.420
Back to the experiment!

12:56.420 --> 12:58.460
What was the order again?

12:58.460 --> 12:59.540
I just remember I hated it...

13:01.250 --> 13:02.380
Oh, well.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.290
Let's just mix these
bad boys up!

13:05.500 --> 13:08.250
No!

13:08.250 --> 13:11.620
No... Way this experiment
doesn't turn out amazing!

13:12.290 --> 13:13.710
EMMA: Ooh!

13:13.710 --> 13:15.170
Maybe I am a genius!

13:16.000 --> 13:17.290
Brava!

13:17.290 --> 13:18.920
Impressive!

13:18.920 --> 13:22.540
Finally something that is
not an assault on my
ears or pocketbook.

13:23.540 --> 13:24.540
(EXPLOSION)

13:30.120 --> 13:32.330
And they said my Ponzi scheme
would blow up in my face.

13:35.670 --> 13:37.540
What is going on here?

13:38.380 --> 13:41.920
Science! Ta da!

13:41.920 --> 13:46.330
Tiffany, do I need to warm up
my arm horns? I just shaved
so they're in tune.

13:46.330 --> 13:47.500
No!

13:47.500 --> 13:51.460
Tiffany, may I speak
to you privately?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.750
I'd rather have witnesses.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.960
Tiffany, these people are
obviously not geniuses, and
I'm legitimately concerned

14:01.960 --> 14:04.040
that I've become dumber
just being around them.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.750
Okay, okay...

14:08.540 --> 14:09.670
Mother...

14:10.620 --> 14:11.920
The truth is...

14:12.670 --> 14:15.000
I lied about Camp Kikiwaka.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.330
It's just a normal
summer camp.

14:17.330 --> 14:20.000
So you've been lying to me
for the past two years?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.620
Tiffany, the word "lie"
shouldn't even be in
your vocabulary!

14:22.620 --> 14:26.540
I should know.
I redacted it from all
your dictionaries!

14:26.540 --> 14:29.540
I'm really sorry
for lying, Mother.

14:29.540 --> 14:33.290
Well, you can think about that
on the way home, while you
write me an apology letter

14:33.290 --> 14:35.080
in 20 different languages.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.330
Go pack your things.

14:36.330 --> 14:39.420
But, Mother...
Now!

14:39.420 --> 14:42.540
But before we go, you didn't
give that Zuri girl any
money, did you?

14:42.540 --> 14:44.920
Even if I did, I couldn't
get it back.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.460
Zuri never leaves
a paper trail.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.580
Tiffany, you can't go.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.670
Woodchuck cabin won't be
the same without you.

14:56.670 --> 14:59.710
Yeah, and you were gonna teach
me how to play horse checkers.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.420
That's chess.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.120
I'll even miss Violet,
the violin.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.420
What are you talking about?

15:06.420 --> 15:08.620
Every time I play her,
you hit me with a rock.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.830
Yes, but I throw it underhand.

15:12.790 --> 15:14.040
Despite that...

15:17.170 --> 15:20.710
I'm going to miss you
guys so much.

15:20.710 --> 15:24.460
Being a woodchuck is the
most fun I've ever had.

15:24.460 --> 15:28.460
Oh, who am I kidding, it's the
only fun I've ever had.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.790
Then you should tell your
mother that
you want to stay.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.250
ZURI: Yeah, Tiff.

15:32.250 --> 15:35.080
You gotta make her see how
great this camp is for you.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.670
Except the food, which has
zero nutritional value.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.790
Have you guys noticed how
the kids here never grow?

15:41.290 --> 15:43.540
Well, I gotta get going.

15:43.540 --> 15:47.460
The only thing my mother hates
more than waiting,
is astrophysicists.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.920
She says they're divas.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.210
Tiffany, look,

15:51.210 --> 15:53.380
I know it's hard, but you
have to try and
convince your mom

15:53.380 --> 15:55.120
that staying here is the
best thing for you.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.170
Yeah, look how
far you've come.

15:57.170 --> 15:59.920
The first time I went
to give you a hug, you thought
I was attacking you.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.580
To be fair, Lou, so did I.

16:03.580 --> 16:04.830
Me, too.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.330
You are a very
aggressive hugger.

16:08.460 --> 16:11.920
Look, I've got a rampaging
skunk, a camp full of stinkos,

16:11.920 --> 16:13.330
and I'm running
out of ketchup!

16:13.330 --> 16:15.620
So, get off your lazy
butt and send help!

16:16.750 --> 16:18.670
Well, same to you, Mr. Mayor!

16:20.250 --> 16:21.830
Man sprayed, man sprayed!

16:21.830 --> 16:23.750
Quick, Xander,
take off your shirt!

16:23.750 --> 16:25.460
I got sprayed, not Xander.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.580
I know.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.960
Okay, new plan.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.250
We're gonna catch that
skunk and have his stink
glands removed.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.540
No, you can't do that!
It's mean!

16:34.540 --> 16:38.040
Hey, I wasn't the one who
sprayed butt water all
over the camp!

16:38.040 --> 16:41.420
Gosh, I hope not.
That's kind of a deal-breaker
for me, Xander.

16:43.330 --> 16:44.420
Tiffany, hurry up!

16:44.420 --> 16:46.040
You're even slower than
Dr. Jansen,

16:46.040 --> 16:48.210
which is why he
got sucked into
that black hole.

16:48.210 --> 16:51.500
On the bright side, "Someone"
can no longer steal my yogurt
from the fridge.

16:52.330 --> 16:53.920
Mother, stop!

16:53.920 --> 16:56.460
Oh, first you lied to me, and
now you're talking back to me?

16:56.460 --> 16:58.710
Skunk!
And now you're
calling me names?

16:59.790 --> 17:01.540
No!
There's a skunk
over there!

17:01.540 --> 17:03.880
And if he feels threatened,
he might spray us.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.210
We need to remain
calm and quiet.

17:06.210 --> 17:07.330
Get him!

17:10.500 --> 17:12.170
Ahhh!

17:12.170 --> 17:13.170
Sorry!

17:15.120 --> 17:16.670
My eyes!

17:16.670 --> 17:18.460
That's what I get for
not wearing my goggles,

17:18.460 --> 17:20.620
even though
I'm not in the lab!

17:20.620 --> 17:24.250
Stay calm, Mother.
I'm just going to use this
water to irrigate your eyes.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.670
(SPITTTING)

17:32.460 --> 17:34.540
Oh, that's a little better.

17:34.540 --> 17:35.960
I'm starting to see
colors again.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.880
You're back?
Is the skunk chasing you?

17:39.880 --> 17:41.500
Nope!
Angry moose!

17:41.500 --> 17:43.040
(MOOSE CALLING)

17:46.380 --> 17:49.080
Here, stinky,
stinky, stinky...

17:49.080 --> 17:53.250
Guys, I don't want anything
bad to happen to Big Stinky.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.380
There he is.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.380
Okay, you little stink box,
your reign of terror is over.

17:58.380 --> 17:59.540
No!

17:59.540 --> 18:01.330
Jorge, what are you doing?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.000
You're right in the path
of his butt canon!

18:03.000 --> 18:06.380
I won't let you de-stink him
and change who he is.

18:06.380 --> 18:10.040
If you do that, he won't
be able to protect
himself in the wild.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.460
What about protecting
the camp?

18:11.460 --> 18:13.330
Just let me talk to him,
for one minute.

18:15.380 --> 18:20.420
Look, Big Stinky, I know how
it feels to have people judge
you because you smell bad.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.500
That's just who we are.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.540
We can't do anything about it.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.380
Well, you could
take a shower.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.750
Or wear deodorant.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.330
Own more than one
pair of underwear...

18:31.880 --> 18:34.460
I was talking to the skunk!

18:34.460 --> 18:39.290
Look guys, I bet if we just
left Big Stinky alone, he
would leave us alone.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.790
Right, buddy?

18:42.960 --> 18:45.420
See?
Kindness worked.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.210
He's leaving.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.460
(YELPS)

18:49.460 --> 18:50.670
I thought we were friends...

18:52.250 --> 18:53.330
(EXCLAMING)

18:53.330 --> 18:54.790
Knock it off.

18:54.790 --> 18:58.210
The weird thing is, Jorge
actually smells better now.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.000
We were running out of
ketchup, so I had to cut
it with lake water.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.620
If you get a rash,
that means it's working.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.460
Where exactly did you go
to nursing school?

19:11.460 --> 19:12.710
The university of Nunya.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.460
Nunya?

19:14.460 --> 19:16.330
Yeah, none ya business.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.210
Don't worry about Hazel.
She's really nice, if you
never get to know her.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.670
Maybe now is a good time to
tell your mom how you feel.

19:27.670 --> 19:29.790
I don't know.
It's okay, Tiff.

19:29.790 --> 19:30.830
We got your back.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.620
Okay.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.710
Mother...

19:36.710 --> 19:38.420
There's something
I want to say to you...

19:38.420 --> 19:40.670
I hope it's that a
real nurse is coming. (SCOFFS)

19:41.710 --> 19:43.380
I heard that!

19:43.380 --> 19:45.830
You're going on my list, lady,
right next to the mayor!

19:48.040 --> 19:49.710
Mother...

19:49.710 --> 19:51.960
I want to stay
at Camp Kikiwaka.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.420
What?
Absolutely not!

19:55.420 --> 19:57.960
You're learning nothing here!

19:57.960 --> 19:59.500
Not true!

19:59.500 --> 20:03.420
Tiffany has gained valuable,
real world knowledge at camp.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.290
For instance, how to take
charge when someone gets
sprayed by a skunk.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.460
That was very impressive.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.460
But it's not going to
get her into Harvard.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.920
But, Mother, there's
more to life than getting
into Harvard.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.330
What?
I shouldn't have gasped.

20:17.330 --> 20:20.170
I just sucked in more
skunk fumes.

20:20.170 --> 20:24.500
I mean, this camp has
done so much for me.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.920
I'm happier, more confident,

20:27.920 --> 20:31.040
and it's given me the
courage to tell you...

20:32.290 --> 20:34.420
You've been pushing
me too hard.

20:34.420 --> 20:36.000
Pushing you too hard?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.500
I'm only doing for you
what my mother did for me.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.170
And I became a world
renowned scientist.

20:41.170 --> 20:44.040
I am this close to discovering
the cure for sleep!

20:45.330 --> 20:46.290
Is that a disease?

20:48.380 --> 20:52.460
Anything that takes eight
hours away from studying
cannot be good for you.

20:52.460 --> 20:57.460
But Mother, Grandma was so
hard on you that you two
don't even talk anymore.

20:57.460 --> 21:00.380
Well, I do send her a
Christmas card every year.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.750
Yeah, with the word "Merry"
crossed off.

21:04.830 --> 21:09.250
Mother, don't you ever resent
Grandma for never letting
you just be a kid?

21:11.540 --> 21:16.420
Well, I always did want to
learn to jump rope,

21:16.420 --> 21:19.290
but Grandma said I might hurt
my test-taking hand.

21:19.290 --> 21:21.670
So you see what I'm saying.

21:21.670 --> 21:24.380
I don't want us to end up
like you and Grandma.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.460
I don't want that either.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.620
And I'm sorry it's been so
hard for me to let you have

21:30.620 --> 21:35.210
f...f...f...

21:35.210 --> 21:36.460
Fudge?
Fashion?

21:36.460 --> 21:37.790
Fiscal independence?

21:39.330 --> 21:41.920
No, fun!

21:41.920 --> 21:44.710
Tiffany, I really do
want you to be happy.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.580
Well,

21:48.580 --> 21:52.420
being with my friend at
Camp Kikiwaka makes me happy.

21:52.420 --> 21:55.790
And getting into Harvard
shouldn't mean having to
give up being a kid.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.330
So...

21:59.040 --> 22:00.330
Can I please stay?

22:04.120 --> 22:06.790
Yes, you may stay.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.250
Thank you, Mother...

22:10.290 --> 22:11.420
Mom.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I love you.

22:15.170 --> 22:16.250
I love you, too.

22:20.330 --> 22:23.380
Aw, that is so sweet.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.380
Yeah.

22:25.380 --> 22:29.250
Do you think this would be a
good time to approach Dr. Chen
about a real estate deal?

22:33.960 --> 22:36.790
♪ Cinderella,
dressed in yellow

22:36.790 --> 22:40.460
♪ Went upstairs to kiss
a fellow,

22:40.460 --> 22:43.330
♪ By mistake she kissed
a snake... ♪

22:43.330 --> 22:45.420
What do you think, Mom?

22:45.420 --> 22:49.750
Well, for starters, I'm very
concerned about this
Cinderella kissing a snake.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.380
Where are her parents?

22:52.500 --> 22:55.290
Hey, Dr. Chen, wanna
give it a whirl?

22:55.290 --> 22:58.710
Oh, "Whirl."
Because the rope is spinning.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.920
Humor! Hah!
It's growing on me.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.420
C'mon, Mom, let's jump
rope together!

23:13.620 --> 23:15.210
Oh...

23:15.210 --> 23:17.580
Oh, my goodness...

23:17.580 --> 23:19.170
This is...

23:19.170 --> 23:20.500
Fun!

23:20.500 --> 23:23.580
And we're learning nothing!
Nothing at all!

23:23.580 --> 23:27.290
Look at me, Mom!
I'm jumping rope,
and I love it!

23:27.920 --> 23:29.420
(LAUGHING)
