(FRENCH ACCENT) Why?

01:14.760 --> 01:16.922
That is the question people ask me most.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.044
(SPEAKS FRENCH) Why? For what?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.088
Why do you walk on the wire?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.850
Why do you tempt fate?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.048
Why do you risk death?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.161
But...

01:27.240 --> 01:30.005
I don't think of it this way.
I never even say this word.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.650
Death. (SPEAKS FRENCH)

01:31.880 --> 01:35.327
Yes, okay, I said it once or, or,
maybe three times just now.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.846
But watch, I will not say it again.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.362
Instead, I use the opposite word.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.601
Life.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.287
For me, to walk on the wire, this is life.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

01:48.520 --> 01:49.601
So,

01:49.680 --> 01:53.082
picture with me, it's 1974, New York City,

01:53.160 --> 01:55.970
and I am in love with two buildings,
two towers.

01:56.040 --> 02:00.125
Or as everyone in the world calls them,
the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.281
They call to me,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.488
these towers,
they stir something inside of me,

02:03.600 --> 02:06.171
and they inspire in me, a dream.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.120
My dream

02:08.280 --> 02:11.648
is to hang a high wire
between those Twin Towers,

02:11.720 --> 02:13.609
and walk on it.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.331
(CHUCKLING)
Of course, uh, this is impossible,

02:16.400 --> 02:18.562
not to mention illegal.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.846
So, why attempt the impossible?
(CHUCKLES)

02:21.920 --> 02:23.729
Why follow your dream?

02:23.800 --> 02:27.247
But I cannot answer this question, "Why?"
Not with words.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.251
But I can show you how it happened.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.849
And so, we must go back in time
and across the ocean,

02:33.920 --> 02:37.402
because my love affair with these
beautiful towers did not begin in New York.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.482
In case you couldn't tell,
I'm not from here.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.849
No. My story begins in another one

So,

36:32.360 --> 36:34.408
how do you intend to pass the cable
across the void?

36:34.480 --> 36:35.960
Well, just like we did at Notre-Dame.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.684
We start with a fishing line
attached to a rope

36:37.760 --> 36:39.205

Yes, it is too far to
throw the juggling ball.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.768
But I was thinking we could get
a radio-controlled airplane

36:47.840 --> 36:50.161

This would be fantastic.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.366

- Okay. Deal.
- JEAN-LOUIS: Do we have a deal?

37:36.160 --> 37:39.448
PAPA RUDY:
The cavalettis cannot be vertical.

37:39.520 --> 37:43.605
They must be horizontal,
parallel to the walk cable.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.444
- Parallel?
- It won't be pretty

37:45.520 --> 37:47.727
but it will keep the cable from swaying.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.090
And you must use three bolts
on the cavaletti clamps.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.931
Not two. A span this wide

37:53.040 --> 37:55.646
will put tremendous pressure
on the brace plates.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.405
And as you walk,
your weight could crack a bolt.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.681
And wood!

38:01.800 --> 38:03.131
You must remember

38:03.200 --> 38:04.611
to put wood blocks

38:04.680 --> 38:06.728
between the wire and the building's struts.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.364
That way, when the building breathe,

38:09.720 --> 38:11.484
the wood will break but the wire won't

38:11.600 --> 38:13.443
explode and tear you in half.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.361

we are more likely to run into people.

But at night, when someone sees us,
we have no excuse to be there.

No, but during the day,
we will certainly run into some people

49:57.760 --> 49:59.046

we bring everything up to the roof

This gives me the time to sneak over
to the North Tower and check the rigging.

Because I must have time
to check the rigging on both towers.

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:51.281
That was incredible.

01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.010
- Just don't do that again.
- No, never.

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.286
(LAUGHING)

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:57.161
PHILIPPE: <i>And you remember Guy Tozzoli
from the press conference,</i>

01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:59.527
<i>one of the men
behind the creation of the towers.</i>

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:00.681
<i>He loved the walk,</i>

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:03.081
<i>and he gave me a pass
to the observation deck</i>

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:04.810
<i>so I could go anytime I wanted.</i>

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.966
<i>And I went there many times alone.</i>

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.883
<i>I would find myself there,
looking at the void</i>

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:29.247
<i>to see how the thought comes back,</i>

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:30.924
<i>how the feeling returns.</i>

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.850
Because it was...

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.130
it was a beautiful day.

01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.368
And you know this pass I was given.

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.841
Well, these passes,
they have a date on them,

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:01.967
a date when they expire.

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:05.801
But on my pass,
Mr. Tozzoli, he crossed out the date,

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.530
and he wrote on it,

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.891
"Forever."
