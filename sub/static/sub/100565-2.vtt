WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:02.002
Another.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.006
--Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.226
-Text me.
-Nope.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.548
The moment my daughter

02:37.592 --> 02:39.594
was taken from me...

02:42.249 --> 02:44.773
It was as if
I was instantly placed

02:44.816 --> 02:47.471
into two concurrent states.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.474
In one,

02:50.518 --> 02:53.782
I had a full understanding...

02:53.825 --> 02:55.784
that Amaya was gone.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.568
There was no doubt.

02:57.612 --> 03:00.571
No... hope.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.094
No holding onto anything.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.271
N... No going back.

03:04.314 --> 03:07.404
Just the certainty of her death.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.406
In the other,

03:09.450 --> 03:12.931
I had no comprehension
of her death.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.153
It was an impossible thing.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.420
An implausible thing.
Absurd.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.597
Vast.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.121
Meaningless.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.514
Untrue.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.953
It wasn't just thatthey were contradictory states.

03:34.997 --> 03:38.479
They were absolute states.

03:38.522 --> 03:42.352
Each was complete in itself,
leaving no room for the other.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.964
But...

03:48.880 --> 03:51.187
...I held them both.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.019
And still do.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.506
There was nothing
anyone could say to me.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.551
There's nothing
I can say to you.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.162
What I can offer
is my duty of care.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.556
You can talk to me at any time.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.472
You can call me at any time.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.474
You have
no professional obligations

04:17.518 --> 04:19.911
that you need to fulfill.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.739
Your job and your income
are secure,

04:21.783 --> 04:24.351
and it'll stay that way
for as long as you need it to.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.397
Thank you.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.447
Can I go...

04:33.490 --> 04:35.492
can I go home?

04:37.973 --> 04:39.322
Yeah, of course.

06:27.691 --> 06:28.953
No.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.352
I spoke to his mother.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.745
I think they're gonna come out.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.492
No, Mom. I...

06:45.535 --> 06:47.624
I really don't want
to come to Hong Kong.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.499
Yes, obviously.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.937
It's awful.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.200
But...

07:01.856 --> 07:03.510
Of course I have friends.

07:06.991 --> 07:10.255
Mom, I haven't even spoken
to those guys

07:10.299 --> 07:12.257
since high school.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.433
Please don't start...

07:19.003 --> 07:20.962
I have friends.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.007
And they're taking care of me.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.752
In fact,
I'm with them right now.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.540
Staying with me.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.237
Yes.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.678
Okay.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.684
Bye.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.867
Fuck!

08:50.181 --> 08:52.183
Fuck.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.876
I died.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.923
What the fuck?

10:19.967 --> 10:21.925
Let me in.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.971
Now, Jamie.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.808
You need to not talk fora moment and just listen to me.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.945
I'm sorry we broke up.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.687
I'm sorry it hurt you.

10:44.731 --> 10:45.862
It hurt me too.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.865
And one day,
we can talk it through.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.607
But right now-- right now--

10:51.651 --> 10:53.653
I need you to move past it.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.795
Earlier today...

11:08.842 --> 11:12.323
...I watched Sergei
burn himself to death.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.716
What?

11:17.024 --> 11:20.636
He walks off the Amaya campus
two days ago...

11:20.680 --> 11:22.899
and disappears.

11:22.943 --> 11:24.901
Totally vanishes.

11:24.945 --> 11:28.775
24 hours later,
he walks back on the campus,

11:28.818 --> 11:31.603
covers himself in gasoline,

11:31.647 --> 11:33.954
and sets himself on fire.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.956
He killed himself.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.218
Yes.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.568
And it makes no fucking sense.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.970
On this phone
there is a sudoku game.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.973
Except, I think
it's not a sudoku game.

11:53.016 --> 11:56.019
And it's password protected.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.587
It is the one thing I have
that might be able

11:58.630 --> 12:01.329
to give me an explanation
about what happened.

12:01.372 --> 12:05.159
And I have one try left
to break it...

12:05.202 --> 12:07.204
...or it wipes.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.801
Okay.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.282
Okay, you're right.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.849
About what?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.807
It's not a sudoku game.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.722
It's a messaging app.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.204
And it's Russian.

12:50.247 --> 12:53.033
And it's state.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.512
In origin, anyway.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.950
How do you know?

12:56.993 --> 12:59.691
Because it's talking to a serverin Kazakhstan

12:59.735 --> 13:01.998
and I recognize
sections of the code.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.957
There are a few different
versions out there,

13:04.000 --> 13:06.829
but this one is...
is pretty old.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.875
But old is good.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.878
Shitload easier
for me to open up.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.010
This is...

13:14.054 --> 13:17.100
I don't know, three
or four years out of date.

13:17.144 --> 13:19.233
Which is weird,

13:19.276 --> 13:20.974
'cause Sergei
was a top-level coder,

13:21.017 --> 13:23.977
but... well, I guess it's like

13:24.020 --> 13:26.022
heart surgeons who smoke
or something.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.112
I don't understand.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.335
Uh... he didn't update.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.902
Or his handlers didn't update.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.904
And you've always got to update.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.471
His handlers?

13:42.343 --> 13:44.345
Lily, come on, if...

13:44.388 --> 13:47.304
if this is Russian state,
your guy was, like...

13:48.828 --> 13:50.786
Like what?

13:54.007 --> 13:56.574
A spy... or something.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.926
Industrial espionage.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.892
Can you open it?

14:09.936 --> 14:12.503
I think so.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.244
But there is a risk.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.246
If it's more modern
than I think,

14:16.290 --> 14:17.682
there might be some
embedded security

14:17.726 --> 14:19.554
that I can't see,

14:19.597 --> 14:21.469
which I might trigger

14:21.512 --> 14:23.950
and then lose everything.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.867
Do it.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.000
Are you sure?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.438
Yes.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.354
Just do it.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.758
Okay, it worked.
We're in.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.635
Jesus.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.120
Jamie...

15:04.164 --> 15:06.470
I need to read it alone.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.995
Yeah, I understand.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.915
I reset the password so you canget back in with this.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.179
Thank you.

15:30.494 --> 15:34.020
You can leave by the front door,if you like.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.344
--Really ought to quit.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.783
I wouldn't bother.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.134
It'll make no difference.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.180
Still.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.620
So...

16:52.663 --> 16:56.493
coroner's report'll
take a while, but...

16:56.537 --> 17:00.410
the police are convinced
that the kid was a suicide.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.630
Uh, they've got a body,

17:02.673 --> 17:05.285
they've got documentary evidenceof the act.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.330
This is over.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.119
Except for the girl.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.164
It's not over for her.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.603
Emotionally, you mean.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.346
Yeah.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.001
Yes.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.264
But that will pass.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.312
It just takes time.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.838
Hasn't for you.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.937
Sir, you've got
more money than God.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.982
You think I care about money?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.246
Did, once.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.248
Yes.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.293
But now I don't.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.386
I was gonna say you got
more money than God

18:03.430 --> 18:06.128
and you live in dust.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.825
Aspic.

18:10.741 --> 18:13.614
So I should buy a bigger house?

18:13.657 --> 18:16.182
Well, I'm not saying that,
but...

18:16.225 --> 18:18.227
baby steps.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.882
Do something.
Uh...

18:23.232 --> 18:24.842
Buy a new car.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.409
That thing's a piece of shit.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.197
Get an electric.
Mm...

18:32.198 --> 18:33.242
Think of the environment.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.768
But I don't
think of the environment.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.391
I understand
what you're saying, Kenton.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.265
But I am not
holding on to the past.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.660
I'm actually letting go of it.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.361
Your tram lines.
Mm.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.058
Ours.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.367
Right.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.505
Good night, sir.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.119
Good night, Kenton.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.208
Come on, baby.

20:10.557 --> 20:13.299
Don't do that.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.822
What'd he do?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.215
Called it "baby".

20:17.346 --> 20:20.262
Oh, well, he can't help it.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.308
He's the era that doesn't know.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.962
Say what?

20:26.312 --> 20:27.835
You're the era
that doesn't know.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.838
The one that says stupid shit
and gets stuff wrong.

20:30.881 --> 20:34.276
You're the fucking era
that doesn't know.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.887
Your era doesn't know shit.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.890
All so fucking political.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.415
All so woke.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.112
But you don't know shit
about history,

20:44.155 --> 20:45.461
you don't know shit about art,

20:45.505 --> 20:48.116
you don't know shit about music.

20:48.159 --> 20:51.119
So you don't know shit
about politics.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.121
So you aren't woke.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.384
You're comatose.

20:57.430 --> 20:58.996
I don't know shit about music?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.303
Please.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.697
Listen to a lot of Bach,
a lot of Coltrane?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.351
No.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.570
Then shut the fuck up.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.181
Stewart.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.227
Just don't call it baby.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.540
Hey.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.585
It's happening.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.511
Yeah, baby.

26:05.346 --> 26:08.218
My name is Anton.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.746
Sergei worked for you.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.357
Since he was an undergraduate
in Moscow.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.622
And you work
for Russian intelligence.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.319
Yes.

26:25.888 --> 26:29.022
You are frightened and confused.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.676
But, at least
where I am concerned,

26:30.719 --> 26:32.025
you should fear nothing.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.244
I have no interest
in hurting you.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.812
In fact, my reason for meeting

26:36.856 --> 26:39.032
is to protect you.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.686
I don't believe you.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.688
At all.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.385
Even your name.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.518
And his.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.609
I understand.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.918
You now doubt Sergei.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.224
Everything about him.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.096
But... he loved you.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.708
And you loved him.
You knew him.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.362
The point here
is that I didn't know him.

27:05.406 --> 27:08.148
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course you knew him.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.848
Maybe not every single thing,
every secret.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.199
But you knew him.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.948
I'm married.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.168
I have a wife
and three children.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.781
They know nothing about my work.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.305
Does this mean
I love them any less?

27:35.349 --> 27:37.351
No.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.530
I want you
to consider something.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.795
I want you to consider

27:46.839 --> 27:50.103
that Sergei had a good reason
for doing what he did.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.716
It might be a good reason
for you too.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.326
What does that mean?

27:56.370 --> 27:58.328
Why are we standing here now?

27:58.372 --> 28:00.548
Because you hacked
Sergei's phone

28:00.591 --> 28:02.855
and contacted me.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.334
Do you think
anyone would do that?

28:04.378 --> 28:05.727
I don't.

28:07.468 --> 28:10.297
You're very resourceful.
Very brave.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.952
I'm not gonna work for you.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.694
I just want to understand
why Sergei killed himself.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.872
Okay.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.790
Then understand this.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.358
In my profession,

28:28.402 --> 28:31.231
when a colleague
commits suicide,

28:31.274 --> 28:33.233
the first thing I say to myself

28:33.276 --> 28:35.626
is they did not commit suicide.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.760
I saw CCTV footage.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.371
He covered himself in fuel.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.025
Then lit it.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.027
That's what you saw.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.768
But hold on to what you know.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.773
Did Sergei feel as ifhe was going to commit suicide?

28:51.817 --> 28:54.210
Was your life together
happy or sad?

28:57.518 --> 29:00.042
Hold on to the fact
that he loved you

29:00.086 --> 29:02.305
and you loved him.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.787
You're telling me
he was murdered.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.616
I have no doubt.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.794
The CCTV film...

29:12.838 --> 29:14.187
Is fake.

29:16.102 --> 29:19.061
You contacted me
because you wanted an answer.

29:19.105 --> 29:20.410
Here is an answer.

29:20.454 --> 29:22.935
Sergei's job
was to infiltrate Devs.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.937
He did it.
Something happened.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.939
He was killed.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.810
If that answer is sufficient,

29:28.854 --> 29:30.986
walk away.
Continue with your life.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.730
If that is not enough,

29:35.774 --> 29:37.776
you're going
to have to work with me.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.302
Sergei's phone is wiped.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.695
If you want to contact me again,

29:44.739 --> 29:46.393
put a sign
in your bedroom window.

29:46.436 --> 29:47.829
The chair you have there.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.875
Where you put clothes.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.093
Don't feel invaded.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.139
Nobody has a private life
anymore.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.971
If you move the chair
away from the window,

29:59.014 --> 30:01.451
I will contact you.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.369
You should.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.307
That's just fucking great.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.142
I don't fucking believe this.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.580
Aren't we all missing the point?

30:43.624 --> 30:46.583
The fact is that our variances
are now so small

30:46.627 --> 30:49.891
that we can make a 2,000-year
backward projection.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.154
No one's missing the point.

30:52.198 --> 30:53.808
Yeah, Stewart is.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.331
Jesus.

30:55.375 --> 30:59.031
we made
a 2,000-year projection.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.816
Where the happy smiles?
Where's the champagne?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.905
We should be bathing in it.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.472
It was a fuzzy projection.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.039
It's unreliable.

31:07.082 --> 31:09.041
Holy shit.
Listen to yourself.

31:09.084 --> 31:11.043
It was a fucking miracle.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.088
No, Stewart.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.048
You want to talk about
the point?

31:16.091 --> 31:17.832
That's the point.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.573
It's not a miracle.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.401
And it needs to be.

31:21.444 --> 31:25.057
We're not chasing
a Nobel Prize here.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.060
The irony is that
despite our quantum computing,

31:28.103 --> 31:30.497
our problem is binary.

31:30.540 --> 31:32.542
It either succeeds totally
or it doesn't.

31:32.586 --> 31:36.155
Anything outside total
is not total.

31:36.198 --> 31:39.071
Well, then the problem
is not binary.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.943
It's reality.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.990
If... if you want
total accuracy--

31:45.033 --> 31:47.514
zero variance--
then a heuristic approach

31:47.557 --> 31:49.168
is never going to work.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.170
You're literally
gonna need a computer

31:51.213 --> 31:52.562
the size of the universe.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.869
One qubit per particle.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.915
Good fucking luck with that.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.832
That may actually be true.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.532
No.
It isn't true.

32:05.575 --> 32:06.968
Why?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.799
Because I know

32:11.842 --> 32:14.149
we're going to do better.

32:14.193 --> 32:18.023
Would that be "I know
we're gonna do better"

32:18.066 --> 32:19.676
or "I know

32:19.720 --> 32:22.114
we're gonna do better"?

32:22.157 --> 32:24.855
He's saying have a little faith,Stewart.

32:24.899 --> 32:26.857
In ourselves.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.903
That's all.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.601
Okay.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.481
Hey, can you guys
give me a moment?

32:46.051 --> 32:48.575
You're right,
you did great work.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.012
And yes, you earned
a bath in champagne,

32:51.056 --> 32:52.666
if that's what you want.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.320
You tell accounting I okayed it.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.977
But... yeah,
I need a moment alone.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.805
Of course.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.285
Let's go.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.348
Hey, man.
You got a smoke?

34:49.391 --> 34:51.350
Um, no.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.786
Aw.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.357
You waiting for someone?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.054
Uh-huh.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.278
-Is it Lily?
-Jesus Christ.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.844
Is it?

35:07.888 --> 35:09.194
Yes.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.631
You're wasting your time, man.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.285
She's already got a guy.

35:13.328 --> 35:14.634
Russkie.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.288
Yeah, thanks.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.550
I-I don't blame you
for trying, though, man.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.204
She is cute.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.510
I'm not trying, man.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.033
Oh.

35:25.340 --> 35:28.300
Well...

35:28.343 --> 35:31.259
I guess I'm gonna stretch
my legs a little, you know?

35:31.303 --> 35:32.782
-An evening constitutional.
-Sure.

35:32.826 --> 35:35.176
You got to stay fit man,
you got to stay healthy.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.425
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:08.818 --> 36:12.170
Can we just talk?
For a couple of minutes?

36:15.260 --> 36:16.609
You want to come in?

36:23.442 --> 36:25.052
Place has changed a bit.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.575
Yeah.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.795
It's nice.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.188
You want to sit?

36:31.972 --> 36:33.408
I'm gonna get a drink.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.062
Can I get you anything?

36:35.105 --> 36:36.542
No, I'm good, thanks.

37:03.003 --> 37:06.528
Was it that you wanted to know
what was on the messaging app?

37:06.572 --> 37:08.617
Oh, no.
I don't.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.316
Really. That's something
between you and him.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.713
Obviously, I hope it was
what you wanted to see.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.414
It wasn't.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.721
Okay.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.205
So what was it
you wanted to talk about?

37:32.337 --> 37:34.730
Well...

37:34.774 --> 37:36.645
I had this crazy thought.

37:36.689 --> 37:38.691
And it got me worried.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.347
And then I couldn't
stop thinking about it.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.742
It's just...

37:46.786 --> 37:48.744
I know you.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.920
You do stuff.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.923
The stuff other people
only think about,

37:53.967 --> 37:56.709
you go right ahead and do it.

37:56.752 --> 37:59.451
And I suddenly realized

37:59.494 --> 38:02.454
Lily won't just
read the messages on the app.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.369
She might actually use the app.

38:04.412 --> 38:07.415
To contact
whoever's on the other end.

38:10.505 --> 38:13.203
Like I said, I know you.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.384
Yeah.
You know me.

38:20.863 --> 38:23.431
So I wanted
to talk you out of it.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.175
I don't think
that would be a good idea.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.265
I agree.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.311
It wouldn't be a good idea.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.272
Really?

38:38.316 --> 38:39.665
Yeah.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.583
So don't worry about it.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.280
Okay.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.936
I mean, I knew
I was probably overthinking.

38:49.979 --> 38:53.418
But that, uh...
that's good.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.118
You okay, Lils?

38:59.467 --> 39:02.340
Under the circumstances?

39:04.298 --> 39:05.604
Yeah.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.649
Under the circumstances.

39:09.825 --> 39:12.088
All right.

39:12.132 --> 39:15.004
Well, that was it, I guess.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.050
Maybe I'll see you
in another couple years.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.401
But, so it's said, uh,

39:20.445 --> 39:22.751
if you need to--
if you want help of any sort--

39:22.795 --> 39:25.363
you can... you can contact me.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.454
I'm not expecting
anything back. I just...

39:29.497 --> 39:31.281
It's just an offer to help.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.283
Thank you, Jamie.

39:33.327 --> 39:34.633
Nah, it's cool.

39:34.676 --> 39:37.418
No. Jamie.
I mean it.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.464
And I mean cool.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.641
See you.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.557
Bye.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.141
Aw, man.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.143
You look glum, brother.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.842
You struck out, huh?
Tried to warn you.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.583
Okay, if I give you ten bucks,

40:11.626 --> 40:12.975
will you never
speak to me again?

40:16.109 --> 40:17.458
Okay.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.857
I just have a 20.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.686
-Here.
-Oh, man.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.036
Thank you, brother.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.429
This is like the best deal...

40:32.560 --> 40:34.475
Oops.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.651
I already broke the terms
of our arrangement, man.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.394
Exactly that kind
of unprofessionalism

40:40.438 --> 40:42.440
led me to a life on the streets.

40:43.571 --> 40:46.705
Hey.
My lips are sealed, man.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.358
Silencio.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.404
Okay? Silencio.

42:41.428 --> 42:42.777
Hey, Ivan.

42:47.086 --> 42:48.696
Anton.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.177
Ah. Okay.

42:51.220 --> 42:52.961
I just wanted to have a...

42:53.005 --> 42:55.747
no-bullshit conversation
with you, if that's okay.

42:58.793 --> 43:00.403
Yes, that's okay.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.492
Great.

43:02.536 --> 43:06.453
So, I don't exactly know
who you are,

43:06.496 --> 43:10.413
but I know what you are.

43:10.457 --> 43:12.415
I know that you tried
to get your boy to pull off

43:12.459 --> 43:14.853
some industrial espionage.

43:14.896 --> 43:18.421
It was a long game,
but it didn't work.

43:18.465 --> 43:20.032
I shut it down.

43:21.773 --> 43:23.513
And now you're gonna try again.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.994
On the short game,
with the girl.

43:26.038 --> 43:28.910
But it's not gonna work
with her, either.

43:28.954 --> 43:30.912
I'll shut her down, too.

43:30.956 --> 43:32.958
You know I will.

43:35.264 --> 43:37.571
And she's just a kid.
Just a bright kid.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.618
Wrong place, wrong time,
wrong boyfriend.

43:42.184 --> 43:43.795
An innocent.

43:43.838 --> 43:45.840
You remember
what they are, right?

43:46.928 --> 43:48.887
-I remember.
-Mm.

43:48.930 --> 43:50.802
So, how about it?

43:50.845 --> 43:53.108
I'm saying,
one professional to another...

43:54.544 --> 43:56.546
...can you let this go?

44:00.986 --> 44:02.988
Please.

44:06.556 --> 44:09.211
This is a no-bullshit
conversation?

44:10.735 --> 44:12.345
Have I bullshitted up to now?

44:12.388 --> 44:13.738
Yes, you have.

44:15.522 --> 44:18.394
You said I should
back off my investigation

44:18.438 --> 44:20.919
for the life
of an innocent girl.

44:22.398 --> 44:24.357
-And?-You don't care about the girl.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.751
You're just using her
as leverage.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.927
And then your strange
private tech company

44:28.970 --> 44:31.756
can continue its strange
private project,

44:31.799 --> 44:33.018
totally unobserved.

44:34.759 --> 44:38.588
Standard American double-speak.

44:40.765 --> 44:43.332
You people so love
to sound straightforward.

44:43.376 --> 44:46.031
Straight-talkers.
Straight-shooters.

44:47.641 --> 44:49.904
Because it gives you
the cover of virtue...

44:51.776 --> 44:53.125
...while you lie.

44:59.784 --> 45:02.003
How's that for no bullshit, Joe?

45:02.047 --> 45:03.962
Kenton.

45:04.005 --> 45:06.007
I know.

50:13.532 --> 50:15.534
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

50:16.970 --> 50:18.450
I'm gonna miss you so much,

50:18.493 --> 50:20.539
but we can speak on the computerso you'll see my face.

50:20.582 --> 50:22.671
But we won't be able
to touch you.

50:22.715 --> 50:24.325
Hey, look.
You'll still have me.

50:24.369 --> 50:27.241
-Just you?-Yes. Just-- Your father. Hi.

50:33.247 --> 50:34.727
Whoa!

50:34.770 --> 50:36.468
How bad is it
for the environment?

50:36.511 --> 50:38.122
-Really bad.

50:38.165 --> 50:40.820
-Mom, this car
doesn't fit all of us.
-I know.

50:43.257 --> 50:44.693
Oof. Do we look alike?

50:44.737 --> 50:48.132
-Are our gabilas the same?
-My God, Mom!

50:48.175 --> 50:49.350
Ooh!

50:51.135 --> 50:54.007
--I see what's on the other side.

50:55.139 --> 50:58.968
Welcome to my midlife crisis!

51:10.415 --> 51:11.285
Ow.

51:15.202 --> 51:17.509
I had no idea
what I would find

51:17.552 --> 51:19.293
when I went searching
for my father.

51:19.337 --> 51:22.296
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,and my heart stopped.

51:22.427 --> 51:24.994
He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.

51:41.272 --> 51:42.099
Check!

51:43.752 --> 51:44.753
Check.
