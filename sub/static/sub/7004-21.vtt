WEBVTT

00:01.934 --> 00:04.535
<i>(tim)</i> you notice
we tighten our lugs
in a star-shaped pattern.

00:04.536 --> 00:08.239
We? I seem to be doing
all the work, tim.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.174
That's because I'm the star,
you're the lug,

00:10.175 --> 00:12.176
That's the pattern.

00:14.614 --> 00:17.048
All right,
once we're finished here,
we put on the center cap,

00:17.049 --> 00:18.850
Lower the jack,
and hit the road.

00:18.851 --> 00:21.853
Hence the term,
"hit the road, jack."

00:25.324 --> 00:27.525
How long does it take you
to change that?
About eight minutes?

00:27.526 --> 00:29.661
Actually, four,
but I'm very fast.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.896
I've been changing tires
all my life.

00:31.897 --> 00:35.133
Really? Your whole life?
Yes, my whole life.

00:35.134 --> 00:39.004
As a matter of fact,
I started out
with my little red wagon.

00:40.405 --> 00:42.406
Then I had the tricycle.
Right, right.

00:42.407 --> 00:45.076
Then big blue,
my first two-wheeler.

00:45.077 --> 00:49.180
You keep
these tire stories going,
I'm gonna have to retire.

00:49.181 --> 00:51.582
Believe it or not, folks,
there's actually people
in this world

00:51.583 --> 00:53.785
That can change a tire
faster than old al here.

00:53.786 --> 00:57.122
I know you're thinking,
"oh, <i>mon dieu!"</i>

00:57.123 --> 01:00.859
I'd like to introduce
the indy car pit crew
from walker racing.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.561
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big hand for 'em!

01:09.501 --> 01:10.935
Ready?

01:10.936 --> 01:12.470
Hit it!

01:22.748 --> 01:25.083
Hey!
<i>(applause)</i>

01:30.556 --> 01:33.357
The pit crew
from walker racing.

01:33.358 --> 01:35.393
And now let's meet the people
that make it work:

01:35.394 --> 01:37.128
The team owner,
derrick walker,

01:37.129 --> 01:39.898
And his lead driver
robbie gordon.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.438
Pleasure to meet you, tim.

01:47.439 --> 01:49.974
Nice to have you guys here.

01:49.975 --> 01:52.577
Uh, you must...
What'd that take?
15 seconds?

01:52.578 --> 01:56.781
Actually, 14.1.
But who's counting, anyway?

01:56.782 --> 01:59.684
Sounds like you are.

01:59.685 --> 02:01.953
I've seen you racing this thing
around the michigan 500.

02:01.954 --> 02:05.090
Boy, keeping it off those walls.
How do you stay focused
all that time?

02:05.091 --> 02:07.158
I just remember
a little saying:

02:07.159 --> 02:11.129
"avoid distraction
or end up in traction."

02:11.130 --> 02:13.598
That'd be a good motto
for you, tim.

02:13.599 --> 02:17.368
Yeah. Well, I have
a little motto for you, al:

02:17.369 --> 02:20.404
"when I'm annoyed,
you're unemployed."

02:23.776 --> 02:26.611
I'm actually pretty good
at changing a tire myself,
you know.

02:26.612 --> 02:28.646
Do you want to try it
on our indy car, tim?

02:28.647 --> 02:31.149
I don't wanna show up
the guys here.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.185
I'm sure they're quaking
in their boots.

02:34.186 --> 02:36.187
Yeah, tim. Give it a try.

02:36.188 --> 02:38.256
<i>(audience whoops and cheers)</i>

02:41.526 --> 02:42.827
All right, al,
you'll time me?

02:42.828 --> 02:45.363
Do you want me to use
a stopwatch or a calendar?

02:50.770 --> 02:52.503
I wonder if I know
how this works.

02:52.504 --> 02:54.873
<i>(wrench starts up)</i>

02:59.544 --> 03:00.745
Ready?
Are you?

03:00.746 --> 03:02.881
Yes.
Go.

03:28.073 --> 03:30.408
Yeah, like butter.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.616
<i>(applause)</i>

03:44.623 --> 03:47.458
Not bad. 38 seconds.

03:47.459 --> 03:51.462
In that amount of time,
we could have changed
23 tires and a baby.

03:51.463 --> 03:53.898
I love that movie.

03:53.899 --> 03:57.168
I wasn't going for speed.
I was going for quality.

03:57.169 --> 03:58.803
'cause in racing,

03:58.804 --> 04:02.073
You don't want a loose tire
to be a weak link.

04:04.910 --> 04:07.511
Or, in this case,
the missing link.

05:04.904 --> 05:07.272
Hi! Anybody home?
<i>(tim)</i> I'm out here.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.907
Come out here.
I wanna tell you something.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.075
All right.
Hey, mom.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.144
There's this really awesome
party at courtney's house

05:13.145 --> 05:14.745
On Saturday night.
Can we go?

05:14.746 --> 05:17.916
Are courtney's awesome parents
gonna be there?

05:20.052 --> 05:21.152
Parents?

05:21.153 --> 05:25.689
Yeah. Those tall,
responsible people.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.558
Well, her parents
won't be home,

05:27.559 --> 05:31.562
But courtney's
15-year-old brother will,
and, you know, he's tall.

05:31.563 --> 05:34.632
And he's also very responsible.

05:34.633 --> 05:38.002
He shows up to detention
on time every single day.

05:39.405 --> 05:42.974
Sorry, guys.
No parents, no party.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.375
<i>(both)</i> aw, man.

05:46.211 --> 05:48.379
Ok, I'm here.
Not that you care,

05:48.380 --> 05:51.682
Now that you have
your new hot rod to play with.

05:51.683 --> 05:54.385
Are you jealous
of this car already?
No.

05:54.386 --> 05:57.188
I'm happy to see you
lust after something older

05:57.189 --> 05:59.623
And uglier than I am.

06:01.793 --> 06:04.128
I've been spending a lot
of time out here lately,
haven't I?

06:04.129 --> 06:07.365
Tell you what.
Saturday night, a night out.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.300
Intimate night. You and me.

06:09.301 --> 06:10.969
Dining.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.104
Dancing.

06:13.105 --> 06:16.007
And hockey.

06:20.912 --> 06:25.116
As, um, romantic
as hockey is...

06:25.117 --> 06:27.751
I think that you've forgotten
that we already have plans

06:27.752 --> 06:30.554
To go to the theater
with al and ilene
Saturday night.

06:30.555 --> 06:32.723
We do?
We've had these tickets
for months.

06:32.724 --> 06:35.393
Can't we sell your tickets?

06:35.394 --> 06:37.996
Well, first of all,
I don't want to,
and second of all,

06:37.997 --> 06:41.599
Hockey tickets are a lot
easier to get rid of
than theater tickets.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.069
Doesn't that tell you
something?

06:45.070 --> 06:48.006
Augie, I can't believe
you don't want to buy
these tickets.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.807
You'd pass up a hockey game
like this

06:49.808 --> 06:52.943
To go to your uncle's funeral?

06:52.944 --> 06:56.414
Yeah. He's not gonna know
you're not there.

06:58.083 --> 07:01.152
What about your aunt?
Does she like hockey?

07:01.153 --> 07:04.122
Augie? Augie?

07:04.123 --> 07:06.957
So I'm guessing no luck.
No luck.

07:06.958 --> 07:09.394
Everybody's got a lot
of good reasons not to go.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.029
A wedding, a funeral.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.264
Open heart surgery.

07:13.265 --> 07:16.167
Guess you're just gonna
have to forget about
these hockey tickets, huh?

07:16.168 --> 07:18.469
Wait a minute.
You know, joe louis arena

07:18.470 --> 07:20.271
Is only five minutes
from this little theater.

07:20.272 --> 07:22.240
You and ilene
can just drop al and me off,

07:22.241 --> 07:24.075
We'll wait out front,
sell the tickets,
and meet you there.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.144
Oh, forget it!
The minute you get near there,

07:26.145 --> 07:28.413
You're just gonna go
to the game.
I promise.

07:28.414 --> 07:32.283
I'll be back in the seat
next to you fast asleep
before the curtain goes up.

07:32.284 --> 07:35.520
That's all I ask.
<i>(doorbell)</i>

07:35.521 --> 07:37.688
Oh, that's wilson.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.726
Hi, wilson.
Well, hi-ho, theatergoers.

07:42.727 --> 07:44.895
Ready for an evening
of thespian watching?

07:44.896 --> 07:47.031
<i>(jill)</i> yeah.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.502
There's thespians
in this play?

07:51.503 --> 07:54.072
Hey, maybe it won't be
that bad after all.

07:54.073 --> 07:57.175
Tim, a thespian is an actor.

07:57.176 --> 08:00.278
Aw, that was my last hope.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.080
Wilson, thanks
for watching the kids.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.681
Help yourself
to something to drink.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.583
And there's pizza
on the way.
Great.

08:05.584 --> 08:08.686
I brought these over
for the boys
for an after-dinner treat.

08:08.687 --> 08:11.689
This is the colombian equivalent
of popcorn.

08:11.690 --> 08:14.158
May I?
Mm-hmm.

08:14.159 --> 08:16.194
Crunchy little...

08:17.762 --> 08:21.699
It's good. What is it?
It's roasted ants.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.868
Needs butter.

08:24.869 --> 08:28.272
So where are the taylor lads?
Well, mark is upstairs,

08:28.273 --> 08:30.841
And brad and randy are moping

08:30.842 --> 08:35.145
Because they're missing
the unsupervised party
of the year.

08:35.147 --> 08:40.217
And I'm moping
'cause I gotta go to a play
called <i>waiting for godot.</i>

08:40.219 --> 08:43.821
Well, tim, <i>waiting for godot</i>
is a wonderful absurdist drama

08:43.822 --> 08:46.890
About two men awaiting
their spiritual awakening
by the side of the road.

08:46.891 --> 08:51.129
By the road. Do they see
any cool cars go by?

08:51.130 --> 08:53.364
I'm afraid not, tim.
Even godot doesn't show up.

08:53.365 --> 08:56.066
Oh, sorry! I hope I didn't
spoil the evening for you.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.736
Jill already did that
by buying the tickets.

09:00.572 --> 09:03.974
Tickets?
Tickets, I got $60 tickets.
Great seats, great seats.

09:03.975 --> 09:06.377
I got some great seats here.
$60 tickets.

09:06.378 --> 09:08.712
Oh, great.

09:08.713 --> 09:11.482
These are only $40 tickets.
Yeah, but I paid 60 for 'em.

09:11.483 --> 09:14.218
You don't want me
losin' money, do you?
What do I care?

09:16.121 --> 09:18.456
Tim, would you please
just lower the price?

09:18.457 --> 09:20.758
The play starts in 15 minutes.
Just relax, al.

09:20.759 --> 09:22.993
The big spenders'll
show up any minute.

09:22.994 --> 09:24.695
Hey, mister, how much
are these tickets?

09:24.696 --> 09:27.731
These are $60 seats.
The best seats in the house,
behind the bench.

09:27.732 --> 09:31.035
I'll give you ten for both.
How about I give you 20
to get out of here?

09:32.871 --> 09:34.372
Let's just go.
You don't want to miss

09:34.373 --> 09:35.939
The beginning of
<i>waiting for godot.</i>

09:35.940 --> 09:40.444
It's a very intricate play.
I played pozzo in high school.

09:40.445 --> 09:43.548
Really?
Junior or senior varsity?

09:43.549 --> 09:46.150
Pozzo is a character
in the play.

09:46.151 --> 09:49.353
And if I do say so myself,
I was the definitive pozzo.

09:49.354 --> 09:52.056
I made him come alive.

09:52.057 --> 09:54.725
Yeah, right, al.
You can barely make yourself
come alive.

09:54.726 --> 09:57.295
I'm leaving.
Wait, wait, wait, al.

09:57.296 --> 10:00.398
We'll do better if we split up.
I'll stay here with this,

10:00.399 --> 10:04.202
You go over and try
to sell one by the guy
selling those big fingers.

10:04.203 --> 10:07.771
I got a ticket here!
I'm going to a play
where no one shows up!

10:10.008 --> 10:13.211
How much?
60 bucks. Great seats.

10:13.212 --> 10:16.480
Sounds good.
You got another one?
Sure I do. Al!

10:16.481 --> 10:19.517
I got a guy over here.
Come on, come on. Perfect.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.420
Great! We can still make it
to <i>waiting for godot</i> on time.

10:22.421 --> 10:26.290
<i>Waiting for godot?</i>
I was in that play
in high school.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.192
So was I.
I played vladimir.

10:28.193 --> 10:29.594
I was pozzo.

10:29.595 --> 10:32.230
"it's a scandal."

10:32.231 --> 10:34.432
"are you alluding
to anything in particular?"

10:34.433 --> 10:38.569
"to treat a man like that.
I think that...

10:38.570 --> 10:41.505
"no! A human being!
No, it's a scandal!"

10:41.506 --> 10:44.174
"you are severe!"

10:46.177 --> 10:49.647
I am bored, and I am wet.
I'd like to see the money.

10:49.648 --> 10:51.549
Uh, yeah. There you go.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.384
You're gonna have
a lot more fun tonight
than we are.

10:53.385 --> 10:55.085
Oh, no, no.
That could be.

10:55.086 --> 10:56.887
No, wait. I got one more thing
I gotta show you.

10:56.888 --> 10:58.322
We gotta go, buddy.
We're late.
Come here, come here.

10:58.323 --> 10:59.590
Oh, you have a badge?

10:59.591 --> 11:02.727
Did you also play officer krupke
in west side story?

11:04.396 --> 11:07.365
No, this is officer keegan.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.700
Precinct 29,
detroit police department.

11:09.701 --> 11:12.703
That's right.
You're both under arrest
for scalping tickets.

11:12.704 --> 11:14.672
What?
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.874
I can't believe this!

11:16.875 --> 11:19.076
I open up to you
by showing you my pozzo,

11:19.077 --> 11:21.145
And you're taking us
to jail?

11:21.146 --> 11:24.014
Well, first of all,
you're not a very good pozzo.

11:24.015 --> 11:27.551
Besides that, scalping is
against the law.
So come on, let's go.

11:27.552 --> 11:29.587
This is all your fault, tim.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.389
Well, I probably could have
talked him out of it,

11:31.390 --> 11:33.957
If you hadn't pulled
your pozzo out
in the parking lot.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.332
<i>(actor)</i> "it's a scandal!"

11:41.333 --> 11:44.302
"are you alluding to anything
in particular?"

11:44.303 --> 11:46.737
"to treat a man like that.
I think that..."

11:46.738 --> 11:48.439
"no! A human being!"

11:48.440 --> 11:53.143
"no, it's a scandal!"
"you are severe!"

11:53.144 --> 11:54.978
You might as well
stop turning around.

11:54.979 --> 11:56.914
They're not coming,
they went to the hockey game.

11:56.915 --> 12:00.951
No. Al will be here,
he loves this play.

12:00.952 --> 12:04.822
In high school,
he played
the definitive pozzo.

12:06.525 --> 12:10.695
Well, now he's
at the hockey game
with the definitive bozo.

12:14.265 --> 12:17.735
I can't understand al
doing something like this.

12:17.736 --> 12:21.405
How could he stoop
to tim's level?

12:21.406 --> 12:24.709
Sorry.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.546
Ah, it's ok.
Sometimes I wonder how tim
can stoop to tim's level.

12:28.547 --> 12:31.349
Shh!
<i>(man snores)</i>

12:38.523 --> 12:40.725
I don't know
why I'm surprised.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.393
I mean, I knew
that the minute I told him

12:42.394 --> 12:44.928
We were going to the theater,
he'd find a way out of it.

12:44.929 --> 12:47.097
I can't believe al would
go with him.
I know.

12:47.098 --> 12:49.199
He's always loved the theater.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.336
He cried when we went to see
<i>a streetcar named desire.</i>

12:52.337 --> 12:57.007
Well, tim cried,
but that was because
there was no streetcar.

12:57.008 --> 12:59.610
Would you please be quiet?

12:59.611 --> 13:02.646
Oh, please yourself.

13:02.647 --> 13:05.583
At least your husband showed up.
Mine went to a hockey game.

13:05.584 --> 13:09.353
How come her husband got
to go to the hockey game?

13:11.590 --> 13:15.058
See what you started?
Now I've just missed part
of the play.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.060
Oh, come on.
There's only five people
in the whole world

13:17.061 --> 13:21.665
Who understand this play.
I doubt that you're one of 'em.

13:21.666 --> 13:25.770
<i>(actor)</i> excuse me,
we're trying to do a play here!

13:25.771 --> 13:28.773
Sorry, pozzo.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.456
Tim! Oh, did you get
through to them?
What did they say?

13:45.457 --> 13:48.559
Did you explain what happened?
Did you get through
to the theater?

13:48.560 --> 13:52.463
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.665
The line was busy.
You know, what they should have

13:54.666 --> 13:57.034
Is "call waiting for godot."

14:02.206 --> 14:05.776
I'll call again later,
all right?
Well, what are we gonna do?

14:05.777 --> 14:09.112
I can't spend the night
in this sardine can!

14:09.113 --> 14:11.081
Just relax.
I'll call again later.

14:11.082 --> 14:12.950
Someone's bound to pick up
over there.

14:12.951 --> 14:16.720
I can't do this.
Where are you supposed
to go to the bathroom?

14:16.721 --> 14:19.256
Oh, my god.
That's the bathroom?

14:20.759 --> 14:23.360
Where are the doors?
They're invisible.

14:23.361 --> 14:26.363
Just like the jacuzzi
and the decorative soaps.

14:27.666 --> 14:32.202
Oh, man. We have to come up
with the bail money now.

14:32.203 --> 14:34.972
Well, um...

14:34.973 --> 14:37.808
Talent show.
Huh?

14:37.809 --> 14:40.010
Yeah. Charge admission.

14:40.011 --> 14:42.312
You do your famous pozzo
for these guys.

14:42.313 --> 14:44.314
It was such a hit with the cop
in the parking lot.

14:44.315 --> 14:46.416
Now, don't you start
criticizing my pozzo.

14:46.417 --> 14:50.320
You know, the reviewer
for the high school paper
said I made him tingle.

14:56.327 --> 14:58.696
Ah...

14:58.697 --> 15:00.531
Ah... Oh...

15:00.532 --> 15:03.567
What are you doing?
It sounds like you're going
into labor.

15:03.568 --> 15:06.203
I can't breathe in here.

15:06.204 --> 15:08.672
The criminals are taking up
all the oxygen.

15:10.976 --> 15:13.010
I can't believe
you got me into this.

15:13.011 --> 15:15.813
My reputation is tarnished.

15:15.814 --> 15:18.315
I'm gonna be ostracized
at bingo.

15:20.451 --> 15:22.786
Oh, yes! The senior citizens
will not want

15:22.787 --> 15:25.656
To sit next to an ex-con.

15:25.657 --> 15:28.258
You're probably right.
"margaret, I got bingo.

15:28.259 --> 15:29.994
"but we ought to get outta here.
Look, next to us,

15:29.995 --> 15:33.864
It's baby face borland!"

15:33.865 --> 15:36.834
Just relax.
No one's gonna know you're here.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.636
It's a holding cell in detroit.
Who's gonna see you here?

15:38.637 --> 15:42.139
Hey, aren't you those guys
from that tv tool show?

15:44.910 --> 15:49.013
Yes, I'm bob vila, this is norm.
We're back together again.

15:53.484 --> 15:56.620
No. You're tim and al!

15:59.691 --> 16:02.626
I used to watch you guys
at jackson state prison.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.962
You got a lot of fans
up there.

16:06.731 --> 16:08.098
Hey!

16:08.099 --> 16:11.101
Hey, that's great!
Lot of fans up there.

16:11.102 --> 16:14.939
We got the 18 to life
demographic.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.274
Hey, great! Ha ha ha!

16:17.275 --> 16:18.576
Whoo!

16:18.577 --> 16:19.810
So...

16:19.811 --> 16:22.479
<i>(deep voice)</i> so, why are you
in here?

16:22.480 --> 16:24.848
Well, I gave somebody a tattoo.

16:24.849 --> 16:27.250
That doesn't sound so bad.

16:27.251 --> 16:30.454
Well, he didn't want one.

16:30.455 --> 16:31.855
Ah.

16:35.359 --> 16:37.561
I'll just let you two
get acquainted.

16:37.562 --> 16:39.597
Uh, tim...
Al!

16:47.839 --> 16:50.608
Boy, you know,
I really love that...

16:50.609 --> 16:53.276
What is that called,
a babushka?

16:56.481 --> 16:59.483
Thank you for helping me
with my school project, wilson.

16:59.484 --> 17:01.819
It's my pleasure, mark.

17:04.454 --> 17:06.556
You know, I've always been
fascinated with papier-mâché.

17:06.557 --> 17:09.792
You know, the name is french,
but actually it was invented
by the chinese.

17:09.794 --> 17:12.295
How do you know
all this stuff?

17:12.296 --> 17:15.833
Mark, I have a tremendous
amount of spare time.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.936
You know, if you boys are
sneaking over to your party,

17:19.938 --> 17:23.272
I'd take a coat.
It's awfully chilly out.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.582
How'd you know
we were sneaking out?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.584
Well, randy,
I've long been a student

17:34.585 --> 17:36.787
Of the eastern philosophy
of the sufis,

17:36.788 --> 17:40.557
And their teachings have
enabled me to obtain
a heightened awareness.

17:40.558 --> 17:42.660
Plus, I saw you out of
the corner of my eye.

17:45.096 --> 17:48.365
Could you just pretend
you didn't see us?
I'm afraid not.

17:48.366 --> 17:50.901
Your mother gave me
very strict instructions.

17:50.902 --> 17:53.771
And five bucks an hour.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.807
Man, why couldn't mom
just let us go to the party?

17:56.808 --> 17:59.442
I mean, she's totally
screwing up our lives.

17:59.443 --> 18:02.780
Well, you boys have
to realize that parents
make rules to protect you,

18:02.781 --> 18:05.816
Not to keep you
from having a funky good time.

18:09.387 --> 18:12.122
I think they do it
just to torture us.

18:12.123 --> 18:14.858
No, no, no, randy.
They do it
for a very good reason.

18:14.859 --> 18:17.728
They want to instill
a sense of discipline
and responsibility in you

18:17.729 --> 18:21.131
So you can be a fine,
upstanding citizen
like they are.

18:21.132 --> 18:23.466
<i>(phone rings)</i>

18:25.170 --> 18:26.670
I got it.

18:26.671 --> 18:28.371
Hello?

18:28.372 --> 18:30.007
Yeah, one sec.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.942
It's mr. Upstanding citizen.

18:31.943 --> 18:34.511
He's in the slammer.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.548
<i>(performance continues)</i>

18:43.054 --> 18:45.823
I can't believe
they went to the game.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.926
I just can't enjoy the play
without al here.

18:48.927 --> 18:52.062
I bet tim's enjoying the game
without me there.

18:52.063 --> 18:54.664
He won't have such a good time
when I'm through with him.

18:54.665 --> 18:58.535
Excuse me, ms. Taylor?
You're gonna have to go to jail.

19:03.274 --> 19:05.042
What? For talking?

19:05.043 --> 19:08.078
Is this a new theater policy?

19:08.079 --> 19:10.981
No, a man named wilson called.
He said your husband

19:10.982 --> 19:12.983
And a mr. Borland
have been arrested.

19:12.984 --> 19:16.453
Oh, my god! Al's in prison?
What did they do?

19:16.454 --> 19:20.224
I'll tell you in the lobby.
We don't want to upset pozzo
again.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.365
For pete's sake, al,
will you sit down?

19:28.366 --> 19:30.367
I can't. This place is filthy.

19:32.937 --> 19:35.405
It's a jail, not the hilton!

19:35.406 --> 19:37.540
Well, they could clean it
once in a while.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.977
You're so right.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.745
Somebody's probably
forgot to hang out

19:41.746 --> 19:44.181
The "please make up the cell"
card.

19:46.151 --> 19:49.319
<i>(whooping)</i>

19:51.355 --> 19:54.224
Uh, thank you.
We're very flattered.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.429
Well, don't get too excited.
They do the same thing for me.

20:04.169 --> 20:05.702
Al, are you all right?

20:05.703 --> 20:08.305
Ilene, it's been horrible.
It's been a nightmare.

20:08.306 --> 20:10.740
It's been 45 minutes.

20:13.278 --> 20:17.547
Wow. This is so weird,
to see you in jail.

20:17.548 --> 20:21.185
Maybe we should get some
of these bars at home.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.822
Only if I can bring
my friends.

20:24.823 --> 20:28.692
You ok? Some of these guys
seem a little scary.

20:28.693 --> 20:32.796
Scariest person in here? Al.

20:32.797 --> 20:35.065
I'll tell you,
the only thing that got me
through this ordeal

20:35.066 --> 20:37.500
Was knowing you were waiting
for me on the outside.

20:37.501 --> 20:39.203
Oh!

20:43.107 --> 20:45.675
Can we continue the epic love
story <i>chained flannel</i>

20:45.676 --> 20:48.145
After we get outta here?

20:51.449 --> 20:53.984
All right, I'll go check
on the paperwork.
Oh, thanks.

20:53.985 --> 20:56.854
I'll be right here.

20:58.723 --> 21:01.191
So I was so angry at you.

21:01.192 --> 21:04.394
Now you've gotten arrested,
I guess I can't get mad anymore.

21:04.395 --> 21:07.931
What? You feel
a little cheated?
Yes, I do. I really do.

21:07.932 --> 21:11.735
I was saving up some words
that'd make even these guys
blush.

21:11.736 --> 21:13.803
I wouldn't mind hearing 'em.

21:15.073 --> 21:16.806
George?

21:16.807 --> 21:19.376
Sorry about you not seeing
the play tonight.

21:19.377 --> 21:23.146
Well, why don't you
go back tomorrow?
Tomorrow?

21:23.147 --> 21:26.950
Traditionally there's
a matinee on Sunday.
Curtain's at two.

21:28.519 --> 21:30.787
George, could we...?

21:30.788 --> 21:34.124
You could have
a nice brunch.
Well, that sounds nice.

21:34.125 --> 21:37.194
Then go see the play.

21:37.195 --> 21:38.728
Sounds lovely.

21:38.729 --> 21:42.332
Maybe afterwards,
you stop and you get her
a nice tattoo.

21:44.202 --> 21:46.836
You know, when you
put it that way,

21:46.837 --> 21:49.873
Honey, there's a whole day
of activity right there.

21:49.874 --> 21:52.575
Maybe a little battleship
right across your cleavage.
No, no.

21:52.576 --> 21:54.577
I think george, you probably
could do it yourself.

21:54.578 --> 21:56.579
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

22:09.093 --> 22:11.494
Yeah! Bravo!

22:11.495 --> 22:13.496
Boy, bravo!

22:13.497 --> 22:15.933
That <i>waiting for godot,</i>
that was a good play.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.534
I wish there were more of it.

22:17.535 --> 22:20.670
Oh, there's more.
This is only the intermission.

22:22.673 --> 22:26.343
You serious?
I gotta sit through
more of this crap?

22:35.786 --> 22:38.922
Hey, guys, I jimmied the lock.
Let's get outta here!

22:38.923 --> 22:42.092
Get the women!
Get the women!
