WEBVTT

00:21.646 --> 00:22.731
You nervous, Bill?

00:25.316 --> 00:28.903
Come on, these guys ain't shit.
Ain't nothin', Bill. Ain't nothin'.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.780
-Pain is only temporary, right?
-That's right.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.949
Go get 'em, devil dog. Go get 'em.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.785
-Russo! Russo! Russo!
-Come on, Bill!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.954
Russo! Russo! Russo!

00:38.038 --> 00:39.164
Russo! Russo!

00:39.247 --> 00:42.751
Russo! Russo! Russo! Russo! Russo!

00:42.834 --> 00:44.711
You're nothing, bitch ass.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.928
Get up, pretty boy.

01:06.649 --> 01:09.652
Castle! Castle!
Castle! Castle!

01:09.736 --> 01:11.446
Castle! Castle!

01:18.745 --> 01:21.122
Is that your nose,
or did a bus park on your face?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.403
I love you, man.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.025
Marine salvage, huh

02:31.568 --> 02:34.529
-Yeah.
-That kid's a trip.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.447
That's some deep shit that she's in.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.032
The both of you.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.702
The bounty on your head, that's no joke.

02:40.785 --> 02:41.786
Five mil?

02:42.370 --> 02:43.830
A man can do a lot with that.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.666
Hey, don't get yourself
any ideas, Curt.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.669
I know you want to replace
that shitbag car of yours.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.965
Ain't gonna be no bounty
if there's nobody alive to pay it.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.926
-'Cause that's what you do.
-Yeah, you bet your ass it is.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.554
You got something
you wanna say about that, Curt?

03:00.096 --> 03:02.390
Nah, it's all been said.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.058
And here we are...

03:05.101 --> 03:06.102
in the rain.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.916
You know them both well.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.752
Yeah, I got a real insight.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.922
Maybe if you did, you'd be drinking, too.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.550
I might have some wine.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.427
If you're staying.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.721
Sure.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.309
I've got nowhere else to go anyway.

03:49.896 --> 03:50.897
We can sit in here.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.399
It's a little less therapeutic
and more friendly.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.902
Is that what we are now, friends?

03:56.778 --> 03:57.779
We can be.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.657
No offense,
but it looks like you need one.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.577
Does "friends" come
with a confidentiality clause?

04:04.661 --> 04:06.955
You can write me a check
if it makes you feel better, Dinah.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.082
-Red?
-Yeah.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.593
-I feel like I'm just doing things.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.180
And for what? None of it changes the fact
that two of my partners have been killed.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.850
I owe it to them to put Billy in prison,

04:27.934 --> 04:29.686
and I feel like I can't move on
until I do,

04:29.769 --> 04:31.813
but I'm never any closer to it.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.731
Look, forgive the clinical language,

04:33.815 --> 04:36.442
but that feeling is what we call
a death equivalent.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.444
People who survive a near-fatal injury

04:38.528 --> 04:41.656
often feel like they're living
a waking death

04:41.739 --> 04:44.450
and nothing matters
and they have no power.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.035
It's totally normal.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.870
Okay, so what do I do about it?

04:48.454 --> 04:49.622
You talk about it.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.209
Talk?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.341
What I should've done
is shoot Billy when I had the chance.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.969
Or let Castle do it.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.054
He was there that night?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.314
Yeah.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.274
The three of us.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.070
Maybe we still are.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.791
Get it out, Dinah. Talk to me.

05:37.253 --> 05:42.050
Frank Castle, Billy Russo,
whatever you wanna share.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.886
Let it out before it kills you.

05:53.561 --> 05:57.106
You can't start to understand
Billy until you understand Frank.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.652
When Frank smashed Billy
into that mirror...

06:02.779 --> 06:04.322
he was looking at himself.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.826
I never wanted you involved
in this shit, Curtis.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.120
Yeah, yeah, I know.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.540
I'd probably be dead or locked up
if you didn't jump in, though.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
Hey...

06:17.960 --> 06:20.421
no one I'd rather be on this roof with
than you.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.298
Maybe except Billy?

06:24.425 --> 06:25.718
Back in the days?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.637
How good was he in a firefight, huh?

06:28.262 --> 06:29.639
But now we know why.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.766
'Cause he's stone-cold crazy.

06:31.849 --> 06:35.603
Yeah. The truth is...

06:36.562 --> 06:38.481
even if I had known it, you know...

06:39.774 --> 06:41.442
I probably wouldn't have given a shit.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.863
When you think about half those assholes
from back then, you know...

06:47.323 --> 06:50.493
I wouldn't piss on them
if they were on fire in the real world.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.830
But over there,
I'd take a bullet for 'em in a heartbeat.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.290
I miss that.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.464
I never saw anything about Bill, you know?

07:07.176 --> 07:09.053
I should have. I should've seen it.
I should've--

07:09.137 --> 07:12.014
You should have what

07:12.807 --> 07:13.933
Come on, Frank.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.271
Maybe I could've helped him.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.441
When have you ever known
for Billy Russo to ask for help?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.109
When have I ever asked for help?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.612
I'm the same.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.032
But here you are, on this roof with me.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.163
You're the only one
that's different, Curtis.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.166
All that time we spent
training to kill people,

07:38.249 --> 07:40.376
you were trained to put 'em back together.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.003
You know, help 'em, heal 'em.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.088
Me and Bill, not so much.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.673
Hey, hey, cut it out.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.009
Stop that. You're nothing alike.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.802
He was lying the whole time.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.263
And maybe he didn't know it himself,

07:52.346 --> 07:55.099
but he was something else,
something empty.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.894
That right there,
that's the difference, Frank.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.729
You give a shit about people.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.481
He doesn't.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.817
You know, I remember...

08:06.777 --> 08:08.988
I remember killing
every one of 'em, Curtis.

08:09.947 --> 08:10.948
You know, just...

08:12.992 --> 08:14.118
They're dead.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.790
Sometimes, I think that's all I got.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.919
Just me and the ghosts.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.464
Blessed are the merciful...

10:33.299 --> 10:34.925
for they shall obtain mercy.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.303
That's nice.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.805
You have no mercy coming.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.395
I wasn't talking about me.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.779
Make it dirty, boys.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.619
Hey, man, listen...

13:07.495 --> 13:09.705
I didn't know
it was gonna go down like that.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.985
You think Billy can still be helped.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.279
But there's no logic in that.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.072
Humans don't work by logic.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.827
We think we do, and we want to,
but in the end we...

15:11.911 --> 15:15.915
We're just ruled by instinct and emotion,
and we justify it to ourselves afterwards.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.666
-Even you?
-Even me.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.295
You know, men think
they're tougher than us?

15:23.464 --> 15:26.300
And too many of us believe it,
but it's bullshit.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.929
They're just way better
at forgiving themselves than we are.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.805
They pulled you into their war.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.642
But that doesn't mean
you have to participate...

15:35.184 --> 15:36.435
or choose sides.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.648
I'm sorry if this is blunt, but how
is Castle any different from Billy?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.902
If we're not judged by the things we do,
then how are we judged?

15:44.985 --> 15:47.321
Castle's family was gunned down
right in front of him,

15:47.404 --> 15:48.948
and he couldn't do anything about it.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.826
The only way to make sense of that is
to stop it from happening to someone else.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.454
What happened to Castle
doesn't give him the right

15:55.537 --> 15:57.957
-to choose who lives and who dies.
-No, it doesn't.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.750
You have to tally up
the good someone's done

15:59.833 --> 16:02.419
compared to the bad they've done,
and you see where they come out.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.005
He's murdered a lot of people.
He wants to murder Billy Russo.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.841
-Never anyone innocent.
-Who decides who's innocent?

16:10.010 --> 16:12.304
I've seen him risk his life
without a second thought

16:12.388 --> 16:13.681
to save women or kids.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.394
So...

16:18.477 --> 16:21.981
What

16:22.064 --> 16:25.275
No, he is exempt because if Frank
ever did the things Billy has done,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.277
he would feel like he was burning in hell.

17:04.773 --> 17:08.485
Slow it down. Slow down.
I paid for an hour.

17:26.837 --> 17:32.760
You wanted molly. I called my guy.
I called my guy who delivers.

17:35.804 --> 17:36.972
You're not my guy.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.947
What the hell, man?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.075
Who the shit are you--

18:04.541 --> 18:06.335
Hi, Linda, it's Curtis.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.712
Yeah, I know. I know.

18:09.421 --> 18:13.092
Hey, look, I think I'm on the mend,
but I'm still not feeling great.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.135
Uh-huh.

18:15.260 --> 18:18.055
Look, I'm telling you,
whatever this is, nobody wants it.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.475
Yeah. Yeah.

18:21.558 --> 18:25.938
Look, uh... Look...
Yeah, I appreciate that. Look, I...

18:26.021 --> 18:28.565
And I'll call you
whenever I'm feeling up to it.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.484
Thank you.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.985
Yeah, yeah, I appreciate it.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.990
Hey. Bravo.
You even did the voice and everything.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.368
-Shit.
-She fall for that shit?

18:40.285 --> 18:44.123
-I just keep shoveling lies.
-Atta boy.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.627
-I told her I had some stomach thing?
-Yup.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.212
The rampant shits.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.673
-Nice. Nice.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.551
Yeah. Here.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.929
You know, this is the real world.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.559
I'd like... I'd like it to be there
when this is all done.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.020
You know, most people
don't have a Frank Castle.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.982
They just pay their premiums
and trust the system.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.150
You're hilarious.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.702
-Are we set?
-Yeah.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.121
Any back doors?

19:24.204 --> 19:25.414
Yeah, there's a tunnel.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.833
That's out by the parking lot there.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.169
Every rat's got a rat run.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.968
You ever heard of the Hashashin

19:39.636 --> 19:42.389
The Hashashin,
the original cult of assassins.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.557
No.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.894
During the Crusades, there was this dude
who organized a bunch of fighters.

19:47.561 --> 19:51.148
He used their desire to defend
the Holy Land for his own vendettas.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.400
He'd send them
on suicide missions and shit.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.527
He made them feel special,

19:56.069 --> 19:59.489
fed them the finest foods,
girls, drugs, all of that.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.203
And the only way they can get it
is doing exactly what he told 'em.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.496
And that's what Billy's doing.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.916
These guys just want to be
a part of something,

20:08.999 --> 20:10.334
and Billy's giving that to 'em.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.004
Now here you come, trying to go in there
and take it all away.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.048
They're not gonna like that.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.967
-They're not gonna like it, Frank.
-They're gonna have to get over it.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.970
Man, they're just... 'bout 15 guys in there.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.348
What? Fifteen guys who are doing
just what Billy tells 'em.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.683
-Nothing else.
-In the end, he's gonna be alone.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.769
That's the thing with Bill.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.021
He's always alone.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.367
Look, I don't understand brotherhood.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.663
Do you know what brotherhood is?

20:50.791 --> 20:53.168
It's a defense against your weakness.

20:56.129 --> 21:00.092
It's surrounding yourself
with people as pathetic as you are.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.099
It's just a way
to avoid staring your own...

21:07.182 --> 21:09.142
your own sins in the face.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.233
Brotherhood is a hall of mirrors...

21:16.817 --> 21:20.028
looking back at you,
reflecting your own self back at you.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.413
But there comes a time...

21:30.789 --> 21:32.833
you gotta smash the mirror...

21:34.543 --> 21:37.129
and look inside
and decide, "Who am I?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.589
What kind of man am I?"

21:47.306 --> 21:49.725
You gotta understand your own true nature.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.356
And you gotta use it.

21:57.858 --> 22:02.571
You gotta understand,
really understand, what is...

22:03.530 --> 22:05.240
that you have to change.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.829
Who among us can look at themselves
without shame?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.800
Get out.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.428
What's that, honey?

22:30.932 --> 22:33.101
Get out. Go. Get out.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.564
Get out. Go. Get out of here.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.442
Get out.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.124
Party tonight!

22:59.336 --> 23:00.921
Woo-hoo!

23:11.139 --> 23:12.432
This goes as usual.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.852
They all get shit-faced by midnight.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.313
00 a.m.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.941
They never stay.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.296
Let's just hope he shows up.

23:44.172 --> 23:45.298
Oh, he'll show up.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.843
Every good commander
needs his men to see him,

23:47.926 --> 23:49.052
kiss the ring.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.555
Or they'll get ideas of their own.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.100
I'm gonna get into position.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.853
You let me know as soon as those women
are out of here, yeah?

23:59.229 --> 24:03.150
Billy shows up, you make the call.
We get this done.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.234
Yeah.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.279
You sure you're all right with this, Curt?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.157
If anything happens to you...

24:11.616 --> 24:13.702
I don't know if I'll be
able to forgive myself.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.828
Yeah, come on.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.331
Yeah, you don't owe me anything.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.542
Come on.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.882
Don't get yourself killed.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.304
I'll do my best.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.320
I love you, John.

24:48.862 --> 24:49.988
I love you.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.659
-Yeah.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.921
My name isn't John.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.007
I'm sorry?

25:11.593 --> 25:12.928
It's Robert.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.431
I wasn't a good man, Rebecca.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.268
It feels wrong not telling you.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.524
I don't wanna keep nothin' from my wife...

25:28.318 --> 25:29.903
if you would have me.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.535
And the man you were before,
do you still feel like that man?

25:36.618 --> 25:37.619
No.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.872
But you're scared
he's still there?

25:40.956 --> 25:42.916
I'm scared he always will be.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.003
I hurt people because they were different.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.298
I hurt people for money.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.051
For revenge.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.639
Every manner of sin, I've done it.
Every one.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.059
I've killed men, Rebecca.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.646
And I did all those things because...

26:05.355 --> 26:09.651
there was something inside of me
that wouldn't stop

26:09.734 --> 26:11.653
until the whole world was blood.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.698
I was so lost.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.659
But now I've been found.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.705
And you are loved.

26:22.872 --> 26:23.957
Finish this.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.462
Come home to me.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.893
Did you always want to work
with people like Billy?

26:45.478 --> 26:51.985
When I was a kid, eight maybe,
I found an injured bird in our yard.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.988
It had probably flown
into one of our windows.

26:55.071 --> 27:01.911
So I took it inside, and my father said,
"That one is a lost cause."

27:02.662 --> 27:03.955
And that broke my heart.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.168
How could anyone give up
on a living thing? So...

27:08.877 --> 27:12.047
I put it in a shoebox,
and I brought it to bed with me.

27:12.589 --> 27:16.217
I gave it water out of an eyedropper,
and I talked to it all night.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.305
And that bird flew away a week later.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.182
Given enough care and love,

27:22.807 --> 27:25.185
even the most lost cause can thrive.

27:26.311 --> 27:30.315
I know it's hard for you to believe that
Billy was worth saving, but I believe it.

27:30.398 --> 27:33.234
You think Billy was a victim
of his shitty childhood?

27:33.318 --> 27:34.986
Children don't get to choose.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.072
And the world is a cruel place.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.490
Because men are cruel.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.326
Billy wanted money and a corner office,

27:41.409 --> 27:44.204
and he took out anyone who was
in his way. It's as simple as that.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.750
You see people when they're broken,
when they're in need of help.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.919
But if you could see the world
from where I'm standing,

27:51.002 --> 27:52.712
you wouldn't think he was worth saving.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.506
Trust me, okay?

27:55.548 --> 27:57.300
They almost never are.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.598
Can I ask you a question about Billy?

28:04.516 --> 28:05.517
Sure.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.605
Say I do it right...

28:12.482 --> 28:14.317
Bring him to court. Put him in jail.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.739
I'd want to see it in his eyes that
he knows I survived it all and he didn't.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.743
Is he even capable of understanding that?

28:26.871 --> 28:28.581
I think the question is...

28:29.749 --> 28:31.167
will that be enough for you?

28:32.585 --> 28:35.630
What's an acceptable outcome
for this story?

28:36.506 --> 28:40.510
You need to answer this question honestly,
or you will never find any peace.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.473
After today...

28:48.643 --> 28:50.019
I want him dead.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.857
But how does that
make you any different

28:53.940 --> 28:56.693
from someone like Billy

28:58.069 --> 29:00.572
These men for who killing
is the answer to everything.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.241
Why will you find comfort in it
any more than them?

29:05.535 --> 29:06.453
Yeah?

29:06.536 --> 29:10.206
I got a PID
on Billy. He just joined the party.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.624
You still good?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.168
What could go wrong?

29:21.050 --> 29:22.177
You boys happy?

29:24.012 --> 29:26.598
-I said, "Is everybody happy?"
-Yes!

29:26.681 --> 29:28.308
-Hells yeah.
-Like a pig in shit.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.392
Yeah.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.352
You should be.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.189
We're kings.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.817
We own this city.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.489
And all I gave you was each other.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.574
This. Us.

29:45.366 --> 29:46.743
Eight of us started this.

29:51.164 --> 29:58.129
Todd, Philip, José and me.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.715
Now, Bobby...

30:02.467 --> 30:05.845
He was a Judas.
He wanted more than everybody else.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.681
Thought that he was better than us.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.018
And I killed him for it.

30:15.522 --> 30:19.150
Now there's another man
that thinks that he's better than us.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.321
He killed another three of our brothers.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.454
The Punisher.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.457
A man just like us once.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.417
My brother!

30:39.128 --> 30:40.755
And then he gave me...

30:43.883 --> 30:44.968
this.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.469
Why?

30:47.178 --> 30:49.681
Because he thinks
that he is better than me,

30:50.598 --> 30:54.727
that he has the right to judge me,
to judge you, to kill you.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.605
But he's not a cop.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.317
He's not a judge.

31:04.737 --> 31:10.660
He don't care about no friendship,
no flag and no cause except his own.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.079
-Screw him!
-He's gonna get his.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.998
Now, in the spirit of what we have here,

31:15.999 --> 31:17.292
I'm not gonna lie to you.

31:19.252 --> 31:23.798
My beef with this man... is personal.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.719
And none of you needs
to have any part of that.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.514
But he's out there right now.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.141
I know him.

31:34.267 --> 31:37.020
And he is arrogant enough to think

31:37.103 --> 31:40.857
that he could come in here after me
like a cat-five hurricane.

31:40.940 --> 31:44.944
And he will kill any of you
that stands between me and him.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.446
Let him try that shit.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.490
That's what Valhalla means.

31:50.533 --> 31:53.578
You built this. We got you.

31:53.661 --> 31:54.704
That's right.

31:54.787 --> 31:57.123
See, I don't want it to be about just me.

31:58.291 --> 32:04.088
It has to be about any of us, all of us.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.634
He is just a man alone, but we...

32:09.677 --> 32:11.054
we got something more.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.099
Easy words.

32:16.601 --> 32:20.688
But are we to die
for what we're building here

32:20.772 --> 32:23.608
It would be easy to kill him.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.611
But I want more than that.

32:26.694 --> 32:30.490
I have more than that
planned for this man.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.992
I need him to understand!

32:37.413 --> 32:38.623
But I need you.

32:41.084 --> 32:45.922
I need all of you with me...

32:47.382 --> 32:48.591
to deliver it.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.606
-There. Take 'em home.
-Okay.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.901
-The others?
-Right where you wanted 'em.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.071
-Hey, what's the plan here, Billy?
-Don't worry about it.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.860
Do you know anyone who is really happy?

34:32.528 --> 34:34.155
Isn't that what keeps you in business?

34:34.238 --> 34:37.408
It's not in our natures.

34:38.159 --> 34:42.705
Take the prettiest girl,
and she'll say she's too short. Or...

34:43.873 --> 34:46.542
the best-looking guy,
and he'll say he's too skinny.

34:46.626 --> 34:51.881
A genius worries about his physique.
A priest questions his faith.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.383
A soldier doubts his courage.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.887
I think if there is a hell,
that's what it would be...

34:59.764 --> 35:03.893
an eternity spent facing our own failings.

35:16.864 --> 35:20.785
"We are each our own devil,
and we make this world our hell."

35:24.038 --> 35:30.711
And so you force yourself to do a job
that is incompatible with your feelings.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.464
Billy Russo chases power

35:33.548 --> 35:37.635
because he fears
that he is worthless and unlovable.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.137
Frank Castle,

35:39.804 --> 35:43.474
he does terrible things,
but he still wants to believe he is good.

35:44.767 --> 35:45.935
So what's yours?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.438
What's your hell?

35:50.064 --> 35:54.610
I believe, despite all evidence
to the contrary, that...

35:56.112 --> 35:58.364
one day I will free one of you from yours.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.133
Oh, hell.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.260
Russo!

37:47.431 --> 37:49.100
How does it feel, Frank?

37:50.518 --> 37:52.937
You think I wouldn't know you were coming?

37:54.397 --> 37:55.898
Where are you, Bill?

37:55.982 --> 37:57.358
I am you, Frank!

37:57.441 --> 37:58.484
Where are you?!

38:10.288 --> 38:11.664
Where are you?

39:13.476 --> 39:14.518
Look at you.

39:19.231 --> 39:20.274
What a mess.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.324
You should have stayed in your hole.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.453
You want to end this, Frank?

39:34.038 --> 39:35.915
This pain is only temporary.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.674
Break him.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.183
Break him and then finish him.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.944
Move! Move! Move!

40:11.367 --> 40:12.451
Shit.

41:04.753 --> 41:05.754
Back off!

41:06.297 --> 41:08.174
I don't wanna have to kill you guys!

41:10.676 --> 41:12.511
This doesn't have to happen!

41:13.095 --> 41:14.180
We're all the same!

41:24.106 --> 41:25.983
Next time, I'm shooting to kill.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.985
Get your asses out of here!

41:38.120 --> 41:40.206
Enough. Enough, man.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.758
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.844
Just stay with me. I got you, all right?
Come on.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.262
Don't let me die.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.431
I'm doing my best, buddy, okay

41:58.349 --> 42:00.643
-Philip.
-Philip, look at me. Keep your eyes on me.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.816
Take him down!

42:28.546 --> 42:30.297
Russo!

43:20.180 --> 43:22.391
Stay with me now.
Stay with me now. All right?

43:22.933 --> 43:25.978
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.
Keep breathing.

43:35.904 --> 43:36.905
Damn it.

43:41.702 --> 43:42.870
Thanks for the drink.

43:43.662 --> 43:45.789
Anytime. I mean it.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.084
-Bye.
-Bye.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.819
I know how to break Castle.

44:15.903 --> 44:17.488
No!

44:17.571 --> 44:19.198
Tell me.

44:19.782 --> 44:22.159
Take away
the one thing he has left.

44:22.242 --> 44:24.244
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

44:26.622 --> 44:28.707
The idea that he is
somehow better than you.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.292
No, no, no, no, no...

44:33.712 --> 44:35.047
That he's good.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.472
Billy!

44:45.015 --> 44:49.895
No, no, no! No! No! No!

44:51.021 --> 44:53.065
Police! Get down!

44:53.941 --> 44:56.110
Get down, or I will shoot you down!

44:57.027 --> 44:59.279
Drop the gun! Drop it now!

44:59.363 --> 45:02.116
Down, or I will shoot you down!

45:02.700 --> 45:05.619
Drop that gun! Drop it now!

45:05.703 --> 45:08.288
I will shoot you! Down on your knees, now!

45:08.872 --> 45:12.668
Drop that gun! Drop it now!
Down on your knees, now!
