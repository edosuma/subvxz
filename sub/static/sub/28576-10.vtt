[Harrow]
Previously onHarrow:

00:07.800 --> 00:09.360
[Chester]
I left you flowers

00:09.400 --> 00:11.280
because I'm the one
who shot you.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.760
[Pavich] I let you go
back to work too early
after the shootings.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.280
Are you self-medicating?

00:15.320 --> 00:16.480
[Fairley] There was
a string of murders

00:16.520 --> 00:17.760
all linked to him.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.760
And Harrow found
the evidence to convict him?

00:19.800 --> 00:21.520
Harrow and Pavich
found propofol

00:21.560 --> 00:24.280
in the liver tissue
of the female victims.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.480
[incinerator roaring]

00:27.160 --> 00:28.360
Could we be looking
at the wrong body?

00:28.400 --> 00:30.440
There's nothing
to prove any of this.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.119
You're a coward.

00:32.159 --> 00:34.440
Dr Harrow asked to exhume
Francis' body.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.600
I said no.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.800
Harrow, get the hell
out of there!

00:37.840 --> 00:39.960
I'm telling you, he's alive!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.920
-What are we looking for?
-Anything to indicate
it's the same body.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.040
-This is Francis Chester.
-So Dr Harrow got it wrong.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.320
So it seems.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.600
Those records
have been altered!

00:47.640 --> 00:48.680
That's impossible.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.200
[Grace]
We can compare the DNA

00:50.240 --> 00:51.520
with Chester's
original arrest swab

00:51.560 --> 00:53.560
-from 15 years ago.
 -[grunts]

00:53.600 --> 00:54.920
[Chester] You can either
try and stop me,

00:54.960 --> 00:56.760
or you can try
and save the boy.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.040
[injection hisses]

01:00.600 --> 01:02.480
[Harrow] Chester's alive,

01:02.520 --> 01:03.920
and I will end this.

Is it about Francis?

[Nichols] Okay.
We'll have an officer
outside the door.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.080
What the hell's
going on, Bryan?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.840
You don't seriously think
I'm making this up?!

03:25.880 --> 03:28.400
This is serious, Harrow.
If Callan had died,

03:28.440 --> 03:30.480
you'd be up
for manslaughter at least.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.720
I saved him!
Chester did that!

03:32.760 --> 03:34.040
Francis Chester is dead.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.160
He's alive!

03:36.200 --> 03:37.400
Why would I hurt Callan?

03:40.080 --> 03:43.520
Look, I want
to trust you, I do,

03:43.560 --> 03:45.600
but, frankly
I got nothing to go on here!

03:47.520 --> 03:50.680
Chester injected a paralytic
into Callan's drip line.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.760
Test the drip line.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.880
Hospital staff
cleaned it up

03:52.920 --> 03:54.040
before it could be tested.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.680
Look, if we checked
Callan's blood,

03:56.720 --> 03:58.000
would the drug
show up there?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.560
The sux would have
metabolised by now.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.200
[elevator bell rings]

04:01.240 --> 04:02.720
Dan, come here.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.280
Are you using
any controlled

04:09.320 --> 04:11.320
or illegal substances
at the moment?

04:11.360 --> 04:12.920
[sighs] The propofol.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.200
I told you,
Chester injected me.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.760
I found these on your boat.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.160
I know, but I didn't
put those there.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.279
Your DNA was on the needle.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.959
Then it must have been
the syringe

04:22.000 --> 04:24.840
that Chester used on me
at the cemetery!

04:24.880 --> 04:26.320
He planted it on the Bettie!

04:26.360 --> 04:28.360
Look, Dan, a lot of people
in our line of work

04:28.400 --> 04:30.040
use substances
to help them cope.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.000
I'm not using!

04:35.560 --> 04:38.280
I'm being set up, Bryan.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.680
[ominous music]

04:46.120 --> 04:48.200
Where's Fern? Is she okay?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.520
Her moped's over the road.
She's not inside.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.520
-Oh, god--
-Harrow!

04:51.560 --> 04:53.280
She's in danger.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.200
There's police everywhere,
that's probably why she--

04:55.240 --> 04:56.800
Why would she
have left her moped?

04:56.840 --> 04:59.840
She's missing! Bryan, please,
you've got to help!

04:59.880 --> 05:02.520
I'll see what I can do.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.520
But you stay put.
You're in enough
trouble as it is.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.960
Okay?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.040
Okay?!

05:07.080 --> 05:08.480
Okay.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.080
Jo?

05:17.880 --> 05:20.000
I need an urgent meeting
with Superintendent Crowley.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.600
Can you sort that out
for me, please?

05:21.640 --> 05:22.600
-Yes, Sergeant.
-Thank you.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.000
[elevator bell rings]

05:25.080 --> 05:26.040
Hey--

05:26.080 --> 05:29.680
[ominous music]

05:40.000 --> 05:41.280
Daniel. What happened?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.040
I didn't hurt Callan.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.920
Of course not.
But where's Fern?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.120
She's not inside.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.560
No one has seen her.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.360
We have to find her.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.720
You think Chester has her?

05:50.760 --> 05:52.280
-I don't know.
-Oh, my god.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.520
What can we do?

05:53.560 --> 05:55.280
Are-- Are the police
doing anything?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.120
Stay on Nichols.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.640
He doesn't believe me,
but he might listen to you.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.400
Well, what
are you going to do?

06:02.440 --> 06:05.480
I have to find something
to prove that Chester's alive.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.800
[Grace]
...succinylcholine,

06:16.840 --> 06:19.120
which as you know metabolises
into succinic acid.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.360
And, look,
succinic acid was found

06:21.400 --> 06:23.720
in Chester's three male victims.

06:23.760 --> 06:29.000
And also in the chemist,
Tim Markides, and Simon.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.600
The same amount
in each victim.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.200
Yes, an amount so small,

06:32.240 --> 06:34.760
it would
never convince a jury.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.360
Well, I'm not trying
to convince a jury.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.000
Grace, what do you want?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.720
I don't know,
but if we can somehow show

06:41.760 --> 06:44.320
that Simon and the chemist
were injected, maybe...

06:44.360 --> 06:45.880
You can prove
that Harrow was right,

06:45.920 --> 06:48.480
and Francis Chester
is actually alive?

06:48.520 --> 06:50.680
Or prove conclusively
that he's wrong.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.000
Right now, Daniel is being
interviewed by the police.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.040
He put Callan Prowd's life
in danger last night!

06:56.080 --> 06:58.920
And your uncle and I are
off to argue to a tribunal

06:58.960 --> 07:02.280
why Daniel should be
allowed to continue
practicing medicine.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.240
-Ready?
-Yes.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.760
You've ordered a DNA test
on the body Harrow dug up.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.840
That should tell us
everything we need to know.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.720
Meanwhile, I am
three key staff down,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.960
so would you please
just do your job?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.400
Tribunal?

07:16.440 --> 07:18.320
The day was bound to come.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.440
[officer] Step
into this room here, sir.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.040
You let Harrow go.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.880
Well, I felt I didn't have
cause to detain him.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.920
Even though he endangered
the life of a patient
in Intensive Care?

07:32.960 --> 07:35.920
He claimed someone else
tampered with Mr Prowd's meds.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.920
-Any proof of that?
-No.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.040
And I believe
Harrow is suspended
from the morgue

07:41.080 --> 07:43.760
pending an investigation
into his attempt
to exhume a body.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.240
Not just any body.
It was Francis Chester.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.680
Look, boss,

07:48.840 --> 07:50.960
I know how it sounds,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.680
There have been a lot

07:53.720 --> 07:56.680
of very concerning
circumstances
surrounding Harrow,

07:56.720 --> 07:59.200
and now his daughter
Fern is missing.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.560
Well, has she got form
for going missing?

08:02.840 --> 08:03.920
Yes.

08:05.960 --> 08:06.960
Ma'am.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.240
Thank you.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.800
-Okay.
-What?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.360
A psychiatrist and magistrate
have just agreed

08:16.400 --> 08:19.520
that Dr Harrow poses a threat
to himself and to others,

08:19.560 --> 08:21.760
and an Involuntary Treatment
Order has just been issued...

08:21.800 --> 08:23.440
Come on, boss!

08:23.480 --> 08:27.800
...stating clearly that
he's to be detained on sight

08:27.840 --> 08:29.680
and transferred
to the Mental Health Unit
at Southside.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.560
[scoffs] But what about--

08:31.600 --> 08:36.400
Bryan, I respect that you
care for Dr Harrow.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.440
But by the sounds of it,
he's gone off the rails.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.240
And he'll get
all the help that
he needs at Southside.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.400
Bring him in, Bryan.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.760
Dr Fairley?

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
Yes.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.320
Um, it took a while, but...

09:01.360 --> 09:02.520
Thank you.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.680
It's a pretty old file.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.440
What exactly is it
that you're looking for?

09:10.240 --> 09:13.200
The name of a family dentist.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.600
Yes, I'm chasing
an urgent DNA sample
for cross-reference?

09:18.240 --> 09:19.840
Chester, Francis Andrew?

09:22.400 --> 09:25.480
Sure, yes. Look, I know it
normally takes that long,

09:25.520 --> 09:27.400
but it's--

09:27.440 --> 09:28.680
Fine, I understand, but

09:28.720 --> 09:30.720
if it can happen sooner,
call me. Thanks.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.680
DNA?

09:32.720 --> 09:34.040
Another 48 hours.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
What's going on?

09:36.600 --> 09:37.640
Have you checked your email?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.840
No. Why?

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
[Grace] Oh, shit.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.040
[Hinton]
Please state your name.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.720
Dr Maxine Aleksandra Pavich.

09:48.760 --> 09:49.840
Thank you, Dr Pavich.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.000
As you know, this hearing--

09:53.040 --> 09:55.360
-Yes, I know what it's for.
-Okay, then.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.760
I see you've brought
in some documentation.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.160
Yes. Uh, post-mortems Dr Harrow
has performed since 1997

10:02.200 --> 10:06.160
and transcripts of evidence
he's given at various courts

10:06.200 --> 10:07.520
as an expert witness.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.200
None of that
will be necessary.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.760
Well, what do you want?

10:11.800 --> 10:15.560
We want you to explain
why a psychiatric evaluation

10:15.600 --> 10:18.920
conducted soon after
Dr. Harrow's shooting

10:18.960 --> 10:21.240
recommended
he not return to work,

10:21.280 --> 10:23.520
yet you ignored that

10:23.560 --> 10:25.200
and let him recommence.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.080
[knock on door]

10:31.120 --> 10:32.120
Not now!

10:34.760 --> 10:36.360
Oh, my god.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.640
Are those girls
that Chester killed?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.440
You do know
that Fern's missing, right?

10:40.480 --> 10:43.160
-We don't know that.
-This is what he'll do to her!

10:43.200 --> 10:44.960
Why are you
not looking for her?!

10:45.000 --> 10:46.680
-Why are you not--
-Steph. Steph!

10:48.840 --> 10:51.600
Right now we're focusing
on finding your ex-husband.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.040
Oh, please.
Dan would never hurt Callan.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.280
You know that!

10:54.320 --> 10:55.320
It's how it looks, Steph.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.080
And what about Fern?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.840
Chester tried to get her
on Daniel's boat.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.520
How can you not believe that?!

11:01.560 --> 11:04.040
I do! I'm her mother!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.240
I know when she's lying
and when she's not.

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
I honestly don't know
where to start looking
for a dead man, Steph.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.320
Have you spoken to his mother?

11:11.360 --> 11:13.200
Yes, and she's just as damaged

11:13.240 --> 11:14.920
by what her son did
as everyone else.

11:15.920 --> 11:16.880
Let me speak to her.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Look!

11:20.280 --> 11:22.520
Please, Steph, just go home.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.600
Just leave it with me.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.120
I'm doing everything I can.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.720
Constable,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.320
escort Miss Tolson
outside, please.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.280
-[knocks echoing]
-Hello! Police!

12:06.320 --> 12:08.160

12:13.760 --> 12:16.480
[disquieting music]

12:24.960 --> 12:26.360
[Nichols]
Good morning! Police!

12:39.120 --> 12:42.160
[Nichols walking away]

12:42.200 --> 12:45.120
[ominous music]

12:52.040 --> 12:55.880
[Dr Biggs] Unfortunately,
we had some water problems
here eight years ago,

12:55.920 --> 12:58.840
and a lot of the older files
got damaged.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.320
Whose records
are you looking for?

13:01.360 --> 13:02.600
Francis Chester.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.240
I had him as a patient
from age six

13:10.280 --> 13:12.600
to maybe... 12?

13:14.080 --> 13:16.440
He wanted
to be called Frank,

13:16.480 --> 13:18.880
but his father
insisted on Francis.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.880
Did you ever meet
Maurice Chester?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.280
No.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.800
A very accomplished
generalist surgeon.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.320
A very... serious man.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.280
Ah.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.600
A bit ruined.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.160
Ask me about
any other patient
from that long ago,

13:42.200 --> 13:44.920
and I couldn't tell you
about their teeth.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.160
But I can tell what
this boy's would have shown.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.800
One of
his adult pre-molars gone.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.920
Gone?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.080
Knocked out

13:58.120 --> 14:00.240
by his father
Maurice Chester.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.280
His mother brought him
in one night.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.440
The boy's mouth was
bleeding like a stuck pig.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.560
And she...

14:08.600 --> 14:10.840
I'm pretty sure
she had bruising
around her throat.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.200
Francis asked me--

14:15.240 --> 14:19.240
begged me--
not to send him home again.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.720
But what choice did I have?

14:26.640 --> 14:29.200
[Hinton] Please state your name
for the purpose of the record.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.040
Dr Lyle Ridgewell
Livingston Fairley.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.680
Thanks for your time, Doctor.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.520
One of the issues
this tribunal is investigating

14:39.560 --> 14:41.400
is that the behaviour
of Dr Harrow

14:41.440 --> 14:44.600
has put himself, others,
and the reputation

14:44.640 --> 14:46.680
of the state coronial system
at risk.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.680
Ha!

14:47.720 --> 14:50.080
Can you elucidate?

14:50.120 --> 14:51.960
I think you'd have
to be more specific.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.920
All right.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.480
In July 2008,

14:55.520 --> 14:58.680
Dr Harrow provoked
a knife fight with a parolee

14:58.720 --> 15:00.440
and was
subsequently hospitalized

15:00.480 --> 15:03.640
for nearly two weeks
at the expense
of the department.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.320
Yes. I remember.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.680
How many post-mortems

15:07.720 --> 15:10.240
could Dr Harrow have
conducted in that time?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.640
Oh, 30 or more, easy.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.160
-So who did them?
-I had to!

15:15.200 --> 15:17.120
And this is far
from atypical behaviour?

15:17.160 --> 15:18.920
Exactly.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.680
Harrow's always doing
that kind of thing.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.720
So you agree Dr Harrow
is a problem?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.120
Certainly not.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.080
The thing
with that knife incident

15:30.120 --> 15:34.360
is that a young boy
had been stabbed to death
just a week previous,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.160
and another young boy
had gone missing.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.680
Harrow was sure it was
that man and that knife,

15:40.720 --> 15:43.400
but the evidence
was insufficient.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.760
So he took it upon himself
to confront the man

15:46.800 --> 15:48.560
and provoke him
into pulling the knife.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.920
Reckless.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.840
Very.

15:51.880 --> 15:57.040
But he did this deliberately
in front of a council camera.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.400
The result is that
the attacker was convicted

16:00.440 --> 16:02.040
and a young life was saved.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.320
Of course it was reckless
and against the rules.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.480
But the rules
don't always embrace

16:13.520 --> 16:16.400
how things sometimes
need to be done now.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.720
Without consultation.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.960
With care only
for a boy who needed saving.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.920
Harrow shouldn't have done it.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.960
He shouldn't have
had to do it.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.640
But he did it.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.720
I can't tell you what to do.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.920
But I can say this--

16:37.960 --> 16:41.680
if you take away
that doctor's ability
to do his job,

16:43.040 --> 16:44.680
we'll all be the poorer for it.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.040
[Harrow] Hi.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.240
Do you know
what's going on?

17:07.760 --> 17:10.760
Anyone who sees you is
supposed to call Security.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.319
There's an Involuntary
Treatment Order out for you.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.319
I'm not surprised.

17:15.359 --> 17:18.800
Nichols also knows
the results of my blood test.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.119
Propofol.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.520
So are you using?

17:24.240 --> 17:27.160
If you are, it's okay.
I mean, I understand.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.600
I've thought about it, too.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.520
No. I'm not.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.880
I didn't inject the propofol.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.360
But I know who did.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.640
I've got something to show you.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.760
[suspenseful music]

17:56.160 --> 17:59.520
Can you bring up the CT scan
of the burned body's teeth?

18:08.400 --> 18:11.400
What are those?
Old dental films?

18:11.440 --> 18:13.640
Where did you get them?

18:13.680 --> 18:15.880
I visited
Chester's childhood dentist.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.720
When he was 12,

18:17.760 --> 18:21.560
Chester's lower second
pre-molar on the right

18:21.600 --> 18:23.280
was knocked out
of his mouth by his father.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.320
His permanent pre-molar?

18:25.360 --> 18:28.200
This skull still has it.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.160
The lower second pre-molar.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.560
It's not a denture
or an implant?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.360
No. That is
a healthy adult tooth.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.800
Because the body
in the cold room
is not Chester.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.040
Those old films,
they're not clear.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.920
-I know.
-And it could be a mistake.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.600
The dentist you got it
from might have misfiled them.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.480
I know.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.600
Or...

19:00.000 --> 19:03.160
Chester somehow swapped
his health records

19:03.200 --> 19:04.760
for that guy
in the cold room.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.040
Yes.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.640
-[knock on door]
-[man] Dr Molyneux?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.880
Oh, shit.

19:08.920 --> 19:09.920
[knock on door]

19:09.960 --> 19:11.320
Dr Molyneux?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.800
-Hi, Glen.
-Hey, Doc.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.400
Uh, Julie here
says that she saw
Dr Harrow come in here.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.440
Really?

19:27.480 --> 19:30.400
Julie, do you mind?

19:34.720 --> 19:37.240
Seriously, Glen, don't you
think if Harrow was here...

19:37.280 --> 19:39.000
-Shh shh. Listen.
-...I would have...

19:39.040 --> 19:41.480
I like Doc Harrow, too.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.160
Once, he gave
mouth-to-mouth to Fuzznuts.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.400
-Hmm?
-My cat.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.960
Saved his life.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.920
Then.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.800
But I still need
to look in there, okay?

19:52.840 --> 19:54.120
Fine.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.960
Okay, you were right.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.240
He's not in there.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.120
Dr Molyneux, can you open
the Archive Room for me, please?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.000
[phone rings]

20:38.080 --> 20:39.440
[rings]

20:40.640 --> 20:42.080
[rings]

20:45.360 --> 20:47.000
[Chester]
Dr Harrow, I know it's you.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.240
Is my daughter alive?

20:52.280 --> 20:53.320
Yes. For now.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.200
What do you want?

20:57.240 --> 20:59.680
I want you.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.320
What do you want me to do?

21:04.360 --> 21:06.520
I'm parked
behind the Institute.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.560
Why don't you
come out and say hi.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.240
There are security guards
out in the corridors right now.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.520
Why don't I just tell them
that you're here?

21:15.560 --> 21:16.960
Well, you could.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
But if you do tell,
I'll know.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.520
And if you're not out here,

21:22.560 --> 21:24.680
alone, in two minutes,

21:24.720 --> 21:27.080
you will never know
what happened to Fern.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.000
-If you hurt her.
-One minute, 55 seconds.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.360
One minute, 54 seconds...

21:34.360 --> 21:36.320
[sighs]

21:43.760 --> 21:45.160
I have to go.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.520
What's going on?

21:46.560 --> 21:48.680
Just show this to Nichols.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.960
What are you going to do?

22:05.720 --> 22:07.600
No security guards?

22:07.640 --> 22:10.000
No. Just me.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.720
Just you.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.280
Lovely.

22:19.560 --> 22:23.600
[ominous music]

22:26.920 --> 22:29.120
Jo, give us
a moment, please.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.000
So where is he?

22:34.040 --> 22:35.280
I let him go.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.280
Have you got any proof?

22:41.080 --> 22:42.920
It's so thin,
you could shave with it.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.000
What?

22:51.560 --> 22:53.480
[Grace] Not all
the dental records match.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.240
[Chester]
This is nice, isn't it?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.200
Having a moment to chat.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.440
This is a mistake,
Francis.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.240
Another mistake.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.480
Another?

23:13.520 --> 23:16.480
You made a mistake not killing
me with that first shot.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.600
You made another
killing Simon.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.960
Another threatening
my daughter.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.080
And what are you
going to do about it?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.680
[laughing]

23:33.240 --> 23:34.520
All this grief.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.400
To hurt me? Why?

23:38.440 --> 23:41.280
It was the police
who caught you.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.960
The DPP who prosecuted you.
The judge who sentenced you.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.200
So why me?

23:47.560 --> 23:50.040
How did you find
the propofol?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.760
In the dead girls.
How did you find it?

23:54.040 --> 23:56.640
The police found propofol
at your house.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.920
Uh-huh. Because I used it
to help my mother sleep.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.640
And I found propofol
in your female victims.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.840
Why are you asking?
You injected it!

24:05.880 --> 24:07.320
Because I didn't.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.400
I didn't.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.400
Succinylcholine
for the boys, sure,

24:13.440 --> 24:15.800
because I knew there'd be
no substantial trace
post-mortem.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.280
But propofol?

24:20.240 --> 24:22.720
I never injected propofol
into those girls.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.880
Yet you miraculously found

24:26.920 --> 24:29.840
traces of propofol
in their liver tissue.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.320
You presented that evidence.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.200
You convinced the jury.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.280
You put me away,

24:38.320 --> 24:41.640
because you planted
the propofol.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.720
Well done.

24:43.920 --> 24:44.920
Well done.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.600
[dramatic music]

25:08.280 --> 25:10.040
-You know, at times like this--
-Don't.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.400
Okay.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.440
[Hinton] It's unfortunate
that Dr Harrow

25:18.480 --> 25:22.000
has neglected to appear
in order to state his case.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.600
But we've heard
sufficient evidence,

25:24.640 --> 25:28.600
and it is
our unanimous decision

25:28.640 --> 25:32.480
to recommend to the Board
of Forensic Surgeons

25:32.520 --> 25:36.680
that Dr Daniel Harrow be struck
immediately from the register.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.520
[Harrow] Mr Lincoln roses.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.160
[disquieting music]

26:08.680 --> 26:09.880
[engine stops]

26:15.560 --> 26:17.440
You've been staying here?

26:17.480 --> 26:20.480
You begged Dr Biggs
not to send you back here.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.720
And yet he did.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.280
That's how you found out
about the exhumation.

26:40.280 --> 26:43.280
Louise, please.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.080
Call the police.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.120
End this now!

26:47.960 --> 26:49.000
It's too late.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.640
[clock ticking]

26:55.360 --> 26:56.440
[Chester] Dr Harrow?

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
[ominous music]

27:16.040 --> 27:17.000
Fern!

27:17.040 --> 27:18.120
Dad! No!

27:36.520 --> 27:39.840
The male victims
were injected with sux...

27:41.480 --> 27:43.800
and female victims
injected with propofol.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.280
How'd you go
with the samples.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.520
I got most of them.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.800
Most of them?
What do you mean?

27:49.840 --> 27:51.080
There's some missing.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.480
Presume you heard
about Daniel being struck off.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.560
There was nothing I could do.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.640
He's made his own bed.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.000
I don't think he did.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.840
Histology slides
for Chester's female victims.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.480
Liver, lung, and brain tissue.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.800
Mm-hmm.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.400
It was in
these liver tissue samples

28:36.440 --> 28:38.320
that Harrow found traces
of propofol.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.360
And it resulted
in Chester's conviction.

28:41.400 --> 28:45.280
But if there was propofol
found in the liver,

28:45.320 --> 28:47.520
it should also have been found
in the brain tissue.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.840
But the brain tissue
samples are gone.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.920
I think it's because someone
discovered at the trial

28:55.960 --> 28:59.080
that Chester had been
in possession of propofol,

28:59.120 --> 29:01.680
so that same someone
added propofol

29:01.720 --> 29:04.040
to the liver tissue samples
to convict him.

29:04.080 --> 29:07.560
But they forgot to add it
to the brain tissue.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.000
And when Harrow started
poking around about Chester,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.400
that someone remembered
those brain tissue samples.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.000
If that were found,
it could all come unstuck.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.520
Impossible
to alter them now, so...

29:18.560 --> 29:20.840
easier to just get rid
of them

29:20.880 --> 29:23.040
and put their absence
down to bad housekeeping.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.320
And you were worried
you weren't going to make
a good pathologist.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.840
Chester was a monster,

29:41.880 --> 29:43.800
the way he killed
all those young couples.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.880
There wasn't going
to be a conviction.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.240
He was going
to keep on killing
and get away with it.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.400
I had to do something.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.320
So you set Harrow up
to perjure himself.

29:56.360 --> 30:00.000
No. Harrow was telling
what he believed
to be the truth.

30:04.600 --> 30:05.760
I was the liar.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.760
I think Chester is alive.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.360
It's impossible.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.280

on the body Harrow dug up.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.440
Then we'll know.

Aw, don't worry.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.920
That was just
a little dose of propofol.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
You know
all about that, right?

31:10.600 --> 31:12.080
And now...

31:12.120 --> 31:14.000

Please, let her go!

31:18.720 --> 31:21.320
Fern, succinylcholine,

31:21.360 --> 31:23.960
it's quite
a clever little paralytic.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.120
It imitates the action
of acetylcholine.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.080
That's a neurotransmitter
that makes our muscles move.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.520
Now, when sux
is administered,

31:31.560 --> 31:35.680
it makes every muscle
in the patient's body twitch

31:35.720 --> 31:39.600
to the point where
it can no longer respond
to any other stimulation.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.440
