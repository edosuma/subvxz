-Jack.
-Hey.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.527
Please come.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.572
-I need you. [whimpers]
-Hm? You okay?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.532

-Brie?

Hey, hey, Brie, I'm here.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.138
-[cries]
-Brie, what happened?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.681
[Brie cries]

00:56.765 --> 00:58.558
-You cut yourself?
-[Brie cries]

00:58.641 --> 01:00.852
[groans] It hurts.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.146

01:03.855 --> 01:05.190
-[Brie sniffles]
-Okay.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.524
[Brie cries]

01:06.608 --> 01:07.567
Okay. Hey.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.445
I'm gonna get you
to the clinic, all right?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.572
[Brie exhales deeply]

01:12.655 --> 01:14.407
[phone rings out]

01:14.491 --> 01:15.492
[Mel] Jack?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.161
-Brie's hurt. Meet me at the clinic.
-I'm on my way.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.708
All right, Mel's gonna take care of you.
Okay, just put your hand around my neck.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.293
Yeah, come on. I got you.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.380
-[Brie cries]
-Okay. It's okay. I got you.

01:37.806 --> 01:41.643
[theme music playing softly]

01:52.153 --> 01:56.282
Okay. So I'm gonna do
an ultrasound now, okay?

01:56.366 --> 01:58.827
-This is gonna be a little bit cold.
-Okay.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.120
-[Mel] Sorry.
-Mm.

02:03.915 --> 02:04.916
[quietly] Okay.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.794
-[groans]
-[Mel] Sorry.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.379
[inhales]

02:09.879 --> 02:11.506
[Brie exhales deeply]

02:12.632 --> 02:15.802
-[Mel] Any pain in your shoulders or back?
-No.

02:15.885 --> 02:16.845
[quietly] Okay.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.887
[Brie exhales]

02:20.140 --> 02:21.391
What's wrong with me?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.144
Um, well,

02:25.979 --> 02:29.524
I still need to do some blood work,
but, um,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.486
I believe you had a miscarriage.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.863
I'm sorry.

02:35.989 --> 02:36.865
[cries]

02:39.200 --> 02:40.368
-Here.
-[Brie sniffles]

02:43.913 --> 02:45.165
Could Jack come in?

02:45.248 --> 02:47.458
Yeah, of course. I'll go get him.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.670
[Brie cries quietly]

02:51.921 --> 02:53.464
[cries]

02:54.048 --> 02:56.050
Hey, Jack. Do you wanna come?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.469
[Brie cries]

02:58.553 --> 02:59.596
Hey, I'm here.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.810
[Jack] Do you know what's wrong?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.399
-[Brie cries quietly]
-She had a miscarriage.

03:12.901 --> 03:13.735
[Brie cries]

03:14.777 --> 03:18.573
You know what? I have some more tissues
in the kitchen. I'll be right back. Okay?

03:21.075 --> 03:22.452
[Brie cries quietly]

03:22.535 --> 03:23.828
Oh, hey.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.371
[Brie cries]

03:25.455 --> 03:27.874
-[cries]
-[Jack] Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.127
-Okay?
-Yeah. [cries]

03:41.221 --> 03:42.305
Morning.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.348
[Mel] Morning.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.183
How is Brie?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.519
I just finished giving her an exam.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.979
She had a miscarriage.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.482
-Oh God.
-[Mel] Yeah.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.650
How's she holding up?

03:53.733 --> 03:55.318
Physically, she's fine,

03:55.401 --> 03:57.779
but I'm gonna recommend
that she see a therapist.

03:57.862 --> 03:58.696
Good plan.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.158
I was thinking that when Hope gets back,
she might wanna talk to somebody.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.370
Yeah.
She's definitely not talking to me. Oy.

04:06.037 --> 04:10.250
I mean, she barely said a word
when I called to tell her about Lilly.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.335
She's probably just in shock.

04:12.418 --> 04:16.631
No. She was angry that I didn't tell her
about Lilly's cancer.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.677
Well, I'm sure that once you guys
get a chance to sit down together

04:20.760 --> 04:22.136
that she'll understand.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.973
-From your lips to God's ears.
-[Mel chuckles]

04:26.140 --> 04:28.268
Will she make it in time
for the funeral today?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.062
Yeah, she's flying into Sacramento,
renting a car.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.064
-It'll be tight, but she'll make it.
-Yeah.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.150
So how is your vision doing
under all this stress?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.319
Pretty well.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.990
So your first anti-VEGF treatment
went well?

04:42.073 --> 04:45.576
If you enjoy having needles
stuck into your eyeballs, then yes.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.328
I would not.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.205
[Doc] Me neither, but… [chuckles]

04:49.289 --> 04:51.624
…I don't have much of an option, you know?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.962
If you wanna go home and get some rest,
I can manage here.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.382
Thanks, but after I look in on Brie,

04:59.465 --> 05:02.677
I wanna drive out to the farm
and check in on Tara.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.805
Well, um, give her my love.

05:05.888 --> 05:06.764
I will.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.267
I'll see you at the funeral.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.351
Yeah.

05:14.105 --> 05:17.692
Hey, Preacher. Do you know how many people
are coming to Lilly's reception?

05:17.775 --> 05:19.444
Jack wanted flutes for the toast.

05:19.527 --> 05:23.990
Well, Tara said family and close friends,
so probably 15, 20 people.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.450
-Okay, cool.
-All right.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.036
Oh, hey, Connie.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.037
Ricky.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.039
-Okay.
-[Connie] We got a problem.

05:31.789 --> 05:32.665
[Connie] Huh.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.752
Sorry, uh, what am I looking at?

05:35.835 --> 05:36.919
Scroll left.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.052
-Vince.
-Uh-huh.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.178
Where'd you take these?

05:45.261 --> 05:48.765
Clear River, this morning. Had to pick up
a flower arrangement for Lilly.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.268
When I saw him, I grabbed my phone.
Why do you think he's here?

05:53.227 --> 05:56.022
Okay, you, uh, remember Sally?

05:56.105 --> 05:58.900
Paige's friend who brought Christopher
back to Virgin River?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.569
-Yeah, I remember her.
-She wants to meet in person.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.323
Do you think her wanting to see you
is connected to Vince?

06:06.157 --> 06:07.367
Yeah, now I do.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.412
And the fact that she's calling me
instead of Paige, it worries me.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.538
Why's that?

06:12.622 --> 06:15.083
Because it tells me
something's not right with Paige.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.834
Thanks.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.798
[sighs]

06:32.975 --> 06:34.185
[knocking at door]

06:34.268 --> 06:35.228
[downbeat] Come in.

06:37.855 --> 06:38.856
Hey.

06:38.940 --> 06:39.899
Hi.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.904
I brought you some, uh,
blueberry muffins from the bakery truck.

06:44.987 --> 06:45.947
[Tara] Thanks.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.074
[sighs]

06:50.701 --> 06:54.705
So, I hear you haven't been up much, huh?

06:55.289 --> 06:56.582
I'm tired.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.418
[Doc] Yeah, it's normal.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.337
Grief drains our energy.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.676
And your sister said you're not sure
if you're gonna speak at the funeral?

07:07.510 --> 07:08.678
What's the point?

07:14.851 --> 07:15.810
I just--

07:16.352 --> 07:19.188
I don't want you to have any regrets
down the road.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.315
It's too hard.

07:23.192 --> 07:26.863
Yeah, the pain of losing someone you love

07:27.989 --> 07:29.157
is overwhelming.

07:30.324 --> 07:35.204
The challenge is
to keep that pain from crushing you.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.873
[quietly] That's how I feel.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.542
Listen to me. I've known you since…

07:40.376 --> 07:44.088
[chuckles] …since you were
knee-high to a grasshopper.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.091
-And you were a scrappy little kid.
-[Tara chuckles]

07:48.718 --> 07:50.386
You're just as tough now.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.183
I don't know what to do.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.604
Start by taking a few deep breaths.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.316
[Tara inhales slowly]

08:03.399 --> 08:04.567
[both exhale deeply]

08:04.650 --> 08:05.485
[Doc] Yeah.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.198
Your friends and your family,
they wanna be there for you. Let them.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.450
I'll try.

08:15.870 --> 08:16.954
Just remember,

08:17.622 --> 08:21.083
your mother loved you with all her heart.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.338
She would not want you to suffer.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.429
[Jack grunts]

08:38.601 --> 08:40.353
I'm not leaving you alone.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.522
Jack, you can go. I'll stay with her.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.525
No, you're both going to the funeral.
I'm fine.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.443
I just wanna sleep.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.946
-What if you need something?
-I will text you.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.074
[inhales slowly]

08:54.408 --> 08:55.660
[Jack exhales deeply]

08:55.743 --> 08:58.538
Mel, please tell Jack
I don't need a babysitter.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.917
Look, if she's comfortable being alone,
it's totally fine.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.627
Thank you, Mel.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.796
Okay.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.882
Mel, would you mind asking Brie

09:09.966 --> 09:12.093
if there's anything
she'd like to eat or drink?

09:12.176 --> 09:13.261
Um… [clears throat]

09:13.344 --> 09:15.972
I will take a ginger ale. Thank you.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.392
[chuckles softly]

09:19.475 --> 09:20.851
All right, be right back.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.649
[door closes]

09:28.442 --> 09:30.194
[sighs slowly]

09:31.862 --> 09:33.698
I don't understand what's wrong with me.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.410
What you're feeling is completely normal.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.789
I just can't believe this has happened
after everything.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.129
You know… [sighs softly]

09:49.589 --> 09:52.758
…when my husband and I
were trying to get pregnant,

09:52.842 --> 09:55.136
I had multiple miscarriages.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.347
-Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to--
-No, it's okay.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.808
Um, I was just telling you because…

10:02.810 --> 10:06.314
I want you to know you're not alone.
I know what you're going through.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.692
[inhales]

10:12.069 --> 10:13.863
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.076
Oh my God, honey. I'm so sorry.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.705
That's a lot to take in all at once.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.873
[Brie sighs deeply]

10:23.956 --> 10:28.252
Just feels like this giant wave
has crashed over me.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.047
Like it's pushing me down.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.256
[Mel] You're strong.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.008
You're gonna get back up.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.345
What if I can't?

10:37.428 --> 10:38.888
Jack and I are here.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.224
Okay? We're gonna help you
get through this.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.184
Mm.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.602
[inhales deeply]

10:44.685 --> 10:46.937
-I'm so tired.
-Okay.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.481
Try to get some sleep.

10:49.065 --> 10:53.653
And, um, if you need anything at all,
just call me, okay?

10:54.278 --> 10:55.112
Yeah.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.366
Hey, Mel?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.784
Yeah?

10:59.867 --> 11:01.661
Thanks for everything.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.080
You're welcome.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.419
[door opens]

11:11.545 --> 11:12.588
[door closes]

11:20.763 --> 11:21.639
Hey.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.894
I'm thinking of having Preacher
make her some chicken noodle soup.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.648
Oh. She's resting now,
so I wouldn't push her to eat.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.983
-Got it.
-Yeah.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.447
So how are you… doing with Lilly?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.573
Oh.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.243
I'm… I'm devastated.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.954
Yeah. I'm still having a hard time

11:45.037 --> 11:47.331
wrapping my head around the fact
that she's gone.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.668
I just-- I feel so bad for Tara.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.547
You know,
I know what it's like to lose your mother.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.591
I can't even imagine.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.054
Preach and I have been sending food
out to the farm.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.849
It's not much,
but I didn't know what else to do.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.144
No, that's really sweet of you guys.
I'm sure she appreciates it.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.397
Yeah.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.774
Um, I should go get ready.

12:13.858 --> 12:18.446
Uh, Mel. Okay. What are we…
Come on, what are we doing here?

12:18.529 --> 12:19.905
What do you mean?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.991
I mean you shutting me out.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.117
I'm-- [sighs]

12:24.076 --> 12:25.619
Can we talk in your office?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.248
[Mel sighs]

12:29.999 --> 12:32.126
Jack, I'm not trying to shut you out.

12:32.209 --> 12:36.172
Okay, avoiding me for the past three days,
that's status quo?

12:36.255 --> 12:37.173
[Mel] No, I'm--

12:37.256 --> 12:39.967
I told you, I just need time to think.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.218
About what?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.262
The night I came back from LA,

12:44.180 --> 12:46.056
you said all the right things,

12:46.140 --> 12:48.017
but the next morning,

12:49.435 --> 12:52.605
I just felt like maybe you were
telling me what I wanted to hear.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.940
No, come on. I wasn't.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.818
I meant what I said.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.989
Look, breaking things off with you
was a huge mistake.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.618
Yeah, I'm worried about
supporting two families,

13:05.701 --> 13:08.454
but my feelings for you
outweigh everything else.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.042
Okay, say we get back together.

13:14.084 --> 13:17.588
Right? I'm worried that down the road,

13:17.671 --> 13:20.549
when you are exhausted
from burning the candle at both ends,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.343
you'll end up resentful.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.303
-That won't happen.
-How do you know that?

13:24.386 --> 13:25.721
Because I know myself.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.809
You think you know yourself now,
but when the twins come,

13:30.434 --> 13:31.644
you're gonna change.

13:31.727 --> 13:35.231
-Ask anybody who's ever had a child.
-I don't care what anybody else says.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.900
I'm telling you how I feel.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.986
Isn't that what you asked me to do?

13:42.780 --> 13:46.742
How am I supposed to prove anything to you
if you don't give me another chance?

13:48.285 --> 13:49.870
I don't know. You're right.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.580
Exactly.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.876
Come on. We'll just start small.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.753
I'll drive you to the church.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.129
You don't have to do that.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.841
Today is gonna be tough for everyone.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.802
Might be nice to have someone to lean on.

14:10.266 --> 14:15.145
[cell phone ringing]

14:16.438 --> 14:18.566
-Hello?
-Staff Sergeant Gomez here.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.277
-Hello, sir.
-I have your ASVAB results.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.487
[Ricky] So, uh, how'd I do?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.072
Scored a 97,

14:25.155 --> 14:27.366
which puts you
in the top tier of recruits.

14:28.075 --> 14:28.951
Wow.

14:29.785 --> 14:33.247
-You'll make an excellent marine, son.
-[sighs] Thank you, sir.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.624
So that's it? It's official?

14:36.125 --> 14:39.795
All that's left is for you to sign
your contract and pick a recruit depot.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.298
Now, I know you were leaning
towards San Diego,

14:42.381 --> 14:45.342
but I think we should
at least discuss South Carolina.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.982
[Mel] Okay,
so the wire transfer came through?

15:00.065 --> 15:00.900
[knocking at door]

15:00.983 --> 15:04.862
Yeah, um, I'll sign the documents
and get them back to you tomorrow, okay?

15:04.945 --> 15:06.071
Great.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.156
Thank you again.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.616
[inhales sharply]

15:10.367 --> 15:12.745
Hey! You don't need to knock.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.789
Hm. Kinda feels like I do.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.293
[Mel] Um,
I'm just gonna need a second. Okay?

15:19.376 --> 15:22.046
Yeah, no, take your time.
We're not in a rush.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.925
[Mel] Oh, hey, um,

15:26.008 --> 15:29.803
you left some clothes in the hamper,
so I washed them.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.349
-Oh, you didn't have to do that.
-[Mel] It's okay.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.686
[Mel] I left them in a bag by the door.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.147
Hm, thanks.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.117
What?

15:52.201 --> 15:55.204
You look… stunning.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.331
Oh.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.418
-Sorry.
-No. Thanks. It's, um, it's fine.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.296
You look nice too.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.508
I just get a "nice"?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.844
-[Jack] You--
-There's nothing wrong with nice.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.930
That's like saying
I have a good personality.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.225
-You do have a good personality, so--
-Oh, wow.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.228
-[Jack inhales]
-All right, fine. How about this?

16:19.311 --> 16:21.647
You look dashing, Mr. Sheridan.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.191
[Jack] Why, thank you.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.568
That's very kind of you to say.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.240
[Mel inhales slowly]

16:31.323 --> 16:33.534
-I'm ready to go if you're ready to go.
-Yeah.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.370
You might wanna grab a sweater.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.579
Yeah, I have one.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.253
[door opens]

16:48.549 --> 16:51.218
[Doc, quietly] We cannot fathom

16:51.301 --> 16:56.432
the unbearable loss and pain
you're experiencing,

16:56.515 --> 17:00.436
and we want you to know you are not alone.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.980
We cannot--

17:03.564 --> 17:06.150
We want you-- We want you to know--

17:06.233 --> 17:11.196
[cell phone ringing]

17:14.324 --> 17:17.077
Hope, hi. Hi. Where are you?

17:20.622 --> 17:21.957
Oh.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.502
No, look, if the rental car
is not fit for the road,

17:25.586 --> 17:28.047
then just return it and--

17:29.715 --> 17:31.300
Okay, just…

17:31.884 --> 17:33.177
just be safe.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.930
And, yeah, I'll meet you at the reception.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.975
Um… I… I love you.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.103

17:53.155 --> 17:54.073
I got it.

17:54.865 --> 17:58.619
You know, you don't have to wear it
if you don't want to.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.080
You're wearing one.

18:02.039 --> 18:02.915
[quietly] Yeah.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.086
Funerals can be pretty sad,

18:07.169 --> 18:09.004
so if this is too much for you,

18:09.630 --> 18:10.714
you just let me know.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.716
I wanna say goodbye to Lilly.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.135
That's a very grown-up thing
for you to do.

18:16.804 --> 18:20.516
You don't have to be worried about me.
You're the one that looks sad.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.267
Yeah.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.520
[inhales deeply]

18:24.603 --> 18:25.771
So, how's that feel?

18:25.854 --> 18:26.814
Better.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.649
[Preacher] Good.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.945
Hey, anyone ever tell you

18:33.654 --> 18:35.322
that you are an awesome kid?

18:35.823 --> 18:36.782
Just you.

18:38.033 --> 18:38.992
And my mom.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.205
[breathes deeply]

18:43.288 --> 18:44.915
Okay, let's go.

18:44.998 --> 18:50.295
[instrumental music playing]

19:06.270 --> 19:07.271
You okay?

19:08.063 --> 19:09.314
Yeah, I'm just, um…

19:11.483 --> 19:13.360
I'm a little overwhelmed. Um…

19:14.361 --> 19:17.322
-You want water? I got some in the truck.
-[Mel] Yeah, okay.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.074
-[Mel] Thanks.
-I'll be right back.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.289
[Mark] You got it.
Pick up those little feet.

Hey, you okay?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.384

-[Mark] What's going on?

19:37.467 --> 19:38.844
My-- [breathes heavily]

19:38.927 --> 19:40.012
Cramp.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.306
Come on. We're at mile seven.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.766
-Five more miles to go.
-No, no, no.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.478
Wait. You go… you go ahead,
and I'll catch up with you in a minute.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.563
Take a sip.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.106
[Mel breathes heavily]

19:52.900 --> 19:54.985
-Okay. And I want you to breathe.
-[sighs]

19:55.068 --> 19:56.612
-Look at me.

-You got this.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.370
-I need to sit down.
-No, don't you sit down.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.123
You've done the hard part, okay?
The rest is all downhill.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.542
It's all downhill? You promise?

20:12.377 --> 20:15.088
Baby, you're my warrior.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.506
-Okay?
-All right.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.217
So it's not all downhill.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.135
-Not all of it, but--
-You're a liar.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.304
-Hey, I believe in you.
-Okay.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.182
-Come on. Let's do it. Let's go. Come on.
-Okay.

Oh! Thank you. [sniffles]

20:36.818 --> 20:38.028

20:39.780 --> 20:42.824
Look, I know this must be hard

20:43.742 --> 20:45.702
with everything you've been through.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.787
[Mel sniffles]

20:48.956 --> 20:49.957
Yeah, it's just…

20:50.832 --> 20:53.293
It's just tougher
than I thought it was gonna be.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.756
Listen, at any point…

20:57.839 --> 20:58.799
[Mel exhales]

20:59.466 --> 21:01.593
…you know, if you feel like it's too much,

21:01.677 --> 21:04.179
just say the word,
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.392
Thanks.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.939
[Doc] Good afternoon.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.901
I think most of you know
I am Vernon Mullins.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.364
For close to 20 years,

21:23.490 --> 21:28.745
Lilly Anderson was a dear,
dear friend of mine.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.499
You may have noticed
my wife, Hope, couldn't be here,

21:32.582 --> 21:35.210
so I'm speaking for both of us

21:35.294 --> 21:41.675
when I say we extend
our deepest condolences to Lilly's family.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.303
We want you to know that you're not alone.

21:45.887 --> 21:50.851
Lilly never failed to help a neighbor or…
[chuckles softly]

21:50.934 --> 21:54.896
[sighs]
…offer a friend a shoulder to cry on,

21:55.564 --> 22:00.861
because Lilly believed
that love was a gift

22:01.695 --> 22:03.530
to share with other people.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.826
She sure shared that gift with all of us.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.331
I once read

22:13.874 --> 22:16.126
that cranky people live longer lives.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.879
If that's the case,

22:18.962 --> 22:20.881
I'm gonna outlive everyone here.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.799
[laughing]

22:22.883 --> 22:26.303
It certainly seems true today.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.682
Lilly was the sweetest person
I've ever met.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.059
She and Buck

22:32.851 --> 22:35.312
shared a love story for the ages.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.690
They were just kids when they met,

22:39.399 --> 22:41.443
but things were hard for them.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.155
Looking after the farm,
trying to keep it going

22:45.238 --> 22:48.700
while raising their beautiful children.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.328
[Lydie] But they kept on going.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.957
I told Lilly,
I want what you and Buck have,

22:57.084 --> 23:01.254
you know, a relationship
where both people give more than they get.

23:01.963 --> 23:05.467
Bless her heart, a week later,
she introduces me to Shirley.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.177
[Bert chuckles softly]

23:08.011 --> 23:09.012
Thank you, Lilly.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.851
Uh, well… [sighs]

23:16.269 --> 23:20.065
[hesitates] …when I first
moved to Virgin River, I, um,

23:21.024 --> 23:22.692
I hardly knew anyone.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.361
Some of you probably remember

23:24.444 --> 23:28.073
I was pretty hell-bent on building the bar
from scratch. [chuckles]

23:28.156 --> 23:32.619
I had a little construction experience,
but I was mostly out of my depth,

23:32.702 --> 23:36.415
and then Lilly started coming by
the job site every day to check in,

23:36.498 --> 23:40.043
and suddenly, all these things I needed
just started showing up.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.213
So I asked her,
"Hey, Lilly, what's going on here?"

23:43.296 --> 23:45.006
And, uh, she said that…

23:49.803 --> 23:51.513
She said what I had to offer

23:52.806 --> 23:54.850
was good for the town, and, um…

23:57.936 --> 23:59.729
she wanted me to stick around.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.274
[sighs softly]

24:03.233 --> 24:08.780
But I will always be grateful to you
for helping me build a life here.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.536
And may you rest in peace
knowing that your…

24:15.954 --> 24:17.456
your memory will live on.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.419
Thank you, Jack.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.298
[sighs]

24:26.381 --> 24:30.302
Well, if anyone else would like to speak,

24:30.385 --> 24:32.179
now would be the perfect time.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.434
All right, then.

that everyone's at the funeral,

28:24.577 --> 28:27.706
Look, I didn't shoot Jack,
and I'm not a dealer.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.499
I just need you to know that.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.254
And-- [sighs]

28:35.046 --> 28:36.548
This isn't an excuse…

28:38.717 --> 28:41.136
but when I was growing up, I… [sighs]

28:41.845 --> 28:44.222
…I didn't have anything.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.187
So when I saw how much cash
I could make working for Calvin, I just--

28:51.271 --> 28:52.272
I jumped at it.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.442
I know.

28:55.525 --> 28:59.487
It was weak, and I wish
I'd never gotten into business with him.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.156
Because you got caught.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.240
No.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.909
Because that's not who I am.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.162
Not anymore.

29:07.996 --> 29:12.375
Sorry, but I just don't believe
people can change who they are.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.919
Well, that's a crappy way
to view the world.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.464
I started my career
as a public defender, Brady.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.133
I've seen the worst in people, so, yeah,

29:20.216 --> 29:24.721
it's hard for me to have faith in people,
especially people who've lied to me.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.144
I'm sorry.

29:34.147 --> 29:38.860
But you're different
from any other woman I have ever met.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.779
You're smart. You're funny.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.573
You stand up for yourself,
which is sexy as hell.

29:47.952 --> 29:53.166
You got this edge to you that's…
I don't know, it's like a freaking magnet.

[Brady sighs]

29:55.627 --> 29:56.753
And I know,

29:58.421 --> 30:01.800
I know I got no business
asking you this, but… [sighs]

30:04.052 --> 30:08.264
…please, give me another chance
to show you who I really am.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.269
Why should I?

31:33.892 --> 31:37.729
You know, I was just sitting out here
thinking about… [sighs gently]

31:37.812 --> 31:41.149
…being at this house
with Lilly's family and how…

31:42.317 --> 31:45.862
[sighs]
…she would've loved to see everyone here.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.405

31:47.488 --> 31:49.949

can't be here.

that I need to get off my chest.

Look, Jack, if it's about us--

32:10.345 --> 32:13.181
Look, it's always about us.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.016
At least it is for me.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.436
You know, from the day I first met you,

32:19.354 --> 32:22.315
almost every decision I've made
has been about you.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.567
I'm serious!

32:25.610 --> 32:27.362
Like, even breaking up with you

32:27.445 --> 32:30.073
was just me trying not to stand in the way
of your dreams.

32:30.156 --> 32:34.285
Yeah, and I'm accepting of our breakup
because I don't want you to be unhappy.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.328
Right.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.456
We both want the other to be happy.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.540
That's…

32:40.750 --> 32:41.709
that's love.

[Mel sighs]

32:43.294 --> 32:46.214
Oh God, Jack,
I just don't wanna get into this here.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.007
Mel, you've gotta hear me.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.593
Look, today at the funeral,

32:50.677 --> 32:53.429
hearing about everything
that Lilly and Buck went through

32:54.555 --> 32:56.265
and how their love prevailed,

32:57.850 --> 32:59.811
that's what makes life beautiful.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.730
That is what I want with you,

33:02.814 --> 33:06.901
so I need you to know
that I am not going to give up on us.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.278
Ever.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.781
I know in my heart

33:11.864 --> 33:16.411
that you did not end up in this
random little town by accident, okay?

33:16.494 --> 33:17.495
[Ricky] Hey, guys.

33:17.578 --> 33:22.083
Um, Jack, Preacher says
we're ready for the toast.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.794
-We'll be right there.
-Thanks, Ricky.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.384
[sighs] Mel.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.929
Jack, they're waiting for us.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.601
-Thanks, Preach.
-You bet.

33:42.311 --> 33:43.271
Hey.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.064
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.238
-Hi.
-Thank you.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.282
Thanks.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.412
-[glass clinks]
-[Ricky] There you go.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.792
So, thank you all for coming.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.715
Today we mourned
the loss of an incredible woman.

34:12.216 --> 34:17.013
Tonight we celebrate her life.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.391
It was a life devoted to friends,

34:21.601 --> 34:22.643
family,

34:24.103 --> 34:25.104
and love.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.735
So I'd like to propose a toast.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.654
In the words of Winston Churchill,

34:34.447 --> 34:38.701
"We make a living by what we get.
We make a life by what we give."

34:39.660 --> 34:42.413
Lilly certainly gave
a heck of a lot more than she took,

34:42.497 --> 34:44.373
and we're all blessed because of that.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.876
I think we can all agree
she made our lives better,

34:48.044 --> 34:49.879
and she will be forever missed.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.381
To Lilly!

34:52.882 --> 34:54.550
[guests] To Lilly!

34:59.931 --> 35:01.766
-[Muriel] Doc!
-Hey!

35:01.849 --> 35:05.186
[Muriel] You did a lovely job
with the service today.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.064
Oh, thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.982
Oh, it was nothing, really.

35:10.066 --> 35:14.112
In all those years as a thespian,
I have learned to memorize things quickly,

35:14.195 --> 35:17.907
so it was my pleasure
to be able to do a little coaching

35:17.990 --> 35:20.368
and "forget the words,
speak from the heart."

35:20.451 --> 35:21.869
Yes. It really helped.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.455
I wanted to be so off-book
for the service,

35:24.539 --> 35:27.834
but these days,
memorizing is not my forte.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.128
-Well, you did a wonderful job.
-Thanks.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.964
So still no sign of Hope?

35:33.047 --> 35:35.466
She didn't even make it
out of the rental car lot

35:35.550 --> 35:38.094
before the check engine light came on.

35:38.177 --> 35:42.265
But I believe she'll be here
in a minute or two. Yeah.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.684
It's just not the same without her, is it?

35:44.767 --> 35:45.935
Well said.

35:46.018 --> 35:47.395
-[cell phone pings]
-Um…

35:49.480 --> 35:51.440
Let me take this.
I'll see you in a minute.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.650
Yeah, yeah, of course.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.848
[softly] I'm just gonna check on Chloe.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.642
-[softly] Oh my God, I have the best news.
-What?

36:26.726 --> 36:29.645
My friend's getting married
in Tulum next month. Isn't that cool?

36:29.729 --> 36:30.730
Yeah.

36:30.813 --> 36:34.442
Her family is renting villas for
the bridesmaids, so we get to go for free.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.736
-Us?
-Yes, dummy.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.529
You'll be my plus-one, right?

36:38.613 --> 36:42.074
I, uh-- I just-- I don't know if I can go.

36:42.158 --> 36:43.034
Why not?

36:43.117 --> 36:46.287
The place is free, and we'll probably
fly on her parents' private jet.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.789
-It's not a money thing.
-Then what is it?

36:53.878 --> 36:56.547
I don't know
where I'm going to be next month.

36:56.631 --> 37:00.176
What are you talking about?
You'll be here getting ready for school.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.261
No, I decided not to go to college.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.306
Oh. So you're gonna keep working
at the bar, then?

37:06.641 --> 37:08.559
Not exactly. [hesitates]

37:09.477 --> 37:10.436
I'm enlisting.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.230
What do you mean "enlisting"?

37:12.855 --> 37:15.233
-I'm joining the marines.
-When?

37:15.983 --> 37:18.152
I sign my contract later this week.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.113
I literally don't understand
what you're saying.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.907
I go to basic this fall.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.619
You planned all this behind my back?

37:26.702 --> 37:30.331
I didn't know if I passed my test.
I didn't wanna say until it was official--

37:30.414 --> 37:32.124
So you've been lying to me?

37:32.208 --> 37:33.834
When I covered your shift,

37:33.918 --> 37:36.212
when you said
you were studying for college--

37:36.295 --> 37:39.799
That marine guy at the Lumberjack Games,
you totally knew each other.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.343
I didn't know how to tell you. I--

37:43.052 --> 37:46.264
I can't believe
I fell for your nice-guy-next-door act.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.517
You're a liar just like the rest of them.

37:55.481 --> 37:58.025
I can't believe
how quickly you put this quilt together.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.902
-[chuckling]
-[Connie] Oh.

38:01.404 --> 38:04.782
Sorry.
Can you just take that for a minute?

38:04.865 --> 38:06.158
Honey.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.910
-Honey?
-[Lizzie sobs]

38:07.994 --> 38:09.120
Oh!

38:09.203 --> 38:11.205
-[Connie] It's okay!
-[sobs]

38:11.289 --> 38:12.999
[Connie] It's okay!

38:13.082 --> 38:15.042
-[Lizzie sobs]
-Oh.

38:15.835 --> 38:16.877
Oh.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.546
She was a beauty.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.381
She measured 45 inches!

38:20.464 --> 38:22.842
Yeah, I haven't had a lot of luck
with striped bass.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.760
I've mostly been pulling in trout.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.721
At least you're pulling in something.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.890
I think my bait went bad.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.767
[laughing]

38:31.851 --> 38:33.269
[Bert] What about you, Jack?

38:33.352 --> 38:35.396
Um… Sorry. Just give me one second.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.401
You have my number now.
You call if you wanna talk.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.319
Thanks.

38:42.403 --> 38:46.449
