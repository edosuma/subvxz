KENDALL ROY:
My dad's in the hospital.

00:04.903 --> 00:05.903
I don't know
if he's gonna be okay.

00:05.986 --> 00:07.654
♪  ♪

00:08.320 --> 00:09.362
KENDALL:
What's the situation?

00:09.445 --> 00:10.737
He's had a hemorrhagic stroke.

00:10.820 --> 00:11.820
My assistant's been in touch

00:11.903 --> 00:13.570
with NYU and we might
move Dad there.

00:13.861 --> 00:16.320
No. He stays here.

00:16.695 --> 00:19.278
I am his proxy.
I am in charge.

00:20.903 --> 00:24.237
The board has a plan in the
event of Logan's incapacitation.

00:24.570 --> 00:27.654
I'll be taking temporary charge
as CEO and chairman.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.111
It wouldn't necessarily be you.
It could be me.

00:30.195 --> 00:31.986
How can I not be
the logical choice?

00:32.070 --> 00:33.362
Dad didn't want you running
the company.

00:33.737 --> 00:36.986
We go for it. Me and you.
CEO and COO.

00:37.070 --> 00:37.986
Okay.

00:40.612 --> 00:42.570
-Yeah, whatever.

00:44.153 --> 00:45.195
Do you know that he gave me
a job?

00:45.403 --> 00:47.445
Come in and see me,
and I'll look after you.

00:47.654 --> 00:50.362
There's a huge debt problem.
Three billion.

00:50.445 --> 00:52.903
You're making it quite fucking
difficult to savor this moment,

00:52.986 --> 00:54.237
-Geri.
-Don't jump.

00:54.695 --> 00:57.320
There's a lot of mess
to be cleaned up, Kendall,

00:57.403 --> 00:59.070
but you can do it, son.

01:19.903 --> 01:24.570
( exhaling in rhythm
with punches )

02:26.237 --> 02:30.654
Richard, can you get me
the price of the Waystar stock?

02:30.737 --> 02:32.820
- At close last night, please.

02:32.903 --> 02:36.111
Good. A little clearer.
He tried to put on a sock.

02:36.195 --> 02:37.779
Tom:
Hey.

02:37.861 --> 02:39.945
- Morning.

02:41.820 --> 02:44.737
Hey, Mondale.
Wish me luck, buddy.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.737
Wish me luck.

02:46.820 --> 02:48.070
What's that? "Good luck, Tom!

02:48.153 --> 02:50.237
Hope it goes well!" OK, so,

02:50.320 --> 02:52.529
just wanted to say goodbye.

02:52.612 --> 02:54.195
Have you seen the numbers?

02:54.278 --> 02:56.903
Man, poor Ken. He's like
dysentery for the stock price.

02:56.986 --> 02:59.362
You are walking
into a burning barn.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.737
Still excited.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.986
- Still rarin' to go.
- Mm-hmm.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.695
Whoa.

03:05.779 --> 03:07.737
I'm just paying homage.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.028
What's that?

03:09.111 --> 03:11.362
You miss me?
Well, I miss you too.

03:11.445 --> 03:13.695
Maybe we should
arrange a date
while she's not around.

03:13.779 --> 03:16.986
- You're weird.
- No, you  are weird! OK!

03:17.070 --> 03:19.861
- Goodbye.
- Oh, Tom.

03:19.945 --> 03:21.153
I'm gonna go see Dad.

03:21.237 --> 03:23.195
If Marcia wants to be difficult,
so can I.

03:23.278 --> 03:25.903
So...can you come with me?

03:25.986 --> 03:27.986
Uh, I gotta stay in front
on this one, baby.

03:28.070 --> 03:28.986
It's a hugie.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.529
My first morning stepping up.

03:30.612 --> 03:33.070
Just say you went
to see the big boss.

03:33.153 --> 03:34.529
Don't make me choose, Shiv.

03:35.779 --> 03:38.028
Please. Don't make me choose.

03:38.111 --> 03:40.529
It's a man's right
not to choose.

03:40.612 --> 03:43.403
Hey, Rava. Can you
give me 30 seconds?

03:43.487 --> 03:45.820
Rava:
Sorry, I'm just
getting the kids ready.

03:45.903 --> 03:47.945
Oh, Luanne,
can you get--

03:48.028 --> 03:49.570
Yeah? OK.

03:49.654 --> 03:50.654
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:50.737 --> 03:52.737
Uh, yeah, so...

03:52.820 --> 03:57.320
this is-- this is dumb,
but bank call this morning,

03:57.403 --> 03:59.903
and I just wanted to ask--

03:59.986 --> 04:01.945
Wait. What bank?
Our old joint account?

04:02.028 --> 04:05.779
Um, no, no, Rava,
the  bank.

04:05.861 --> 04:09.612
ICBC, who have apparently
bankrolled the old man
for years.

04:09.695 --> 04:12.654
I'm sorry.
I'm-- just in a rush. OK.

04:12.737 --> 04:14.487
Just two minutes?

04:14.570 --> 04:15.654
What's your read?

04:15.737 --> 04:18.820
Do I go... do I go Hulk,
or Bruce Banner?

04:18.903 --> 04:22.320
Well, K-Kendall,
talk to your people about--

04:22.403 --> 04:27.070
I know, you're just-- you're
always so good with this stuff,
and just, uh--

04:27.153 --> 04:29.654
The Hulk is the incredible one,
right? The Hulk.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.195
We have to go. I'm sorry.

04:31.278 --> 04:33.445
Why don't you ask Roman

04:33.529 --> 04:35.820
- Roma-- Rava. Come on.

04:35.903 --> 04:37.195
- I'm sorry.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.320
Kids: Bye!

04:38.403 --> 04:40.779
Bye, guys.
Bye-bye. I love you.

06:16.945 --> 06:19.779
- Roman: Uh, seven.

06:19.861 --> 06:21.570
- OK.

06:21.654 --> 06:23.278
You're in decent shape,

06:23.362 --> 06:26.111
you're a little sloppy,
but I can get you
tight as a drum.

06:26.195 --> 06:29.654
Ah. Well, I trust Pax,
and Pax says you're the best.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.070
I'm only gonna say
one thing, Roman, OK?

06:31.153 --> 06:31.986
Go for it.

06:32.070 --> 06:33.487
I take my shit serious,

06:33.570 --> 06:35.028
that's why I have
the reputation that I do,

06:35.111 --> 06:36.487
and I need you
to take it serious, too. OK?

06:36.570 --> 06:37.945
Dude, I'm-- I'm onboard,

06:38.028 --> 06:40.320
so you can skip the whole
speech bullshit, OK?

06:40.403 --> 06:42.403
- I'm down.
- All right. 5:30 every day.

06:42.487 --> 06:45.028
Yeah, man, I'm serious.
I'm serious as cancer.

06:45.111 --> 06:48.737
Fuckin' more serious.
Fuckin' money  cancer.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.320
You know, I'm COO now.

06:51.403 --> 06:52.529
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.986
That's Chief Operating Officer.

06:55.070 --> 06:58.986
It's Waystar Royco,
so if it operates,
I chief it.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.028
Flip over on your belly.

07:01.111 --> 07:04.362
Yeah.
Ahh.

07:04.445 --> 07:07.320
But yeah, no,
5:30, that's perfect.

07:07.403 --> 07:09.654
- Yup.

07:09.737 --> 07:12.654
Well, good,
because the other 5:30
I'll be at work, ya know?

07:12.737 --> 07:15.529
Being an agent of change
and fuckin' firing people.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.861
Thank you.

07:21.945 --> 07:23.403
Marcia:
Ask her to wait there.

07:23.487 --> 07:24.903
Oh! She's here.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.028
- It's the morphine.

07:27.111 --> 07:29.737
- It's not that unusual.
- I know. I'm fine.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.737
- Marcia: Hi, Shiv.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.403
- Shiv: Hi!
- Hi, Tom.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.111
Hey. I'm afraid I can't stay.

07:35.195 --> 07:37.111
- Excuse me one second.
- Tom: First day.

07:39.945 --> 07:41.529
- Hi.
- What's the--

07:41.612 --> 07:42.529
What's going on?

07:42.612 --> 07:43.986
- Nothing.

07:45.111 --> 07:46.529
Staff.

07:48.195 --> 07:49.529
Good to see you.

07:49.612 --> 07:51.529
Yeah. I know you said
that he wasn't great,

07:51.612 --> 07:52.779
but I was passing by,

07:52.861 --> 07:54.028
so I thought I'd just
drop in.

07:54.111 --> 07:55.529
That is so sweet.

07:55.612 --> 07:58.570
But you know, he's not
seeing people right now.

07:58.654 --> 08:00.945
Yeah, but I thought
I could just pop up.

08:01.028 --> 08:03.070
Even if, you know, he's grumpy.

08:03.153 --> 08:04.695
I think it's best you don't.

08:04.779 --> 08:07.403
Marcia, I've seen my dad
do the Master Cleanse.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.570
I can take him
a little bit grouchy.

08:09.654 --> 08:11.820
I'm afraid that
is out of the question.

08:13.612 --> 08:15.654
Um, do you--
Might it be an idea

08:15.737 --> 08:18.570
to check and see whether
he's changed his mind?

08:18.654 --> 08:20.070
- Yeah.

08:20.153 --> 08:22.028
Of course.

08:28.195 --> 08:30.028
What the fuck?

08:30.111 --> 08:31.861
I know. I have to go.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.028
Yeah, I know.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.570
Oh, hey. Hello. Hi!

08:34.654 --> 08:35.903
I'm Shiv.

08:35.986 --> 08:38.278
Logan's daughter.

08:38.362 --> 08:40.820
I just-- I wanted
to say thank you for--

08:40.903 --> 08:42.070
for all your work.

08:42.153 --> 08:44.070
You're quite welcome.

08:44.153 --> 08:46.654
- Yeah. It's much appreciated.
- Thank you.

08:46.737 --> 08:48.737
And how does he seem today?

08:48.861 --> 08:49.820
Good?

08:49.903 --> 08:52.028
Oh... you know.

08:52.111 --> 08:53.570
Actually, we don't.

08:53.654 --> 08:55.820
We heard al about the sock.

08:57.195 --> 08:58.195
Yeah.

09:15.612 --> 09:16.945
It'll stabilize.

09:17.028 --> 09:19.820
Mm-hmm. I know.
I know it will.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.362
So... I've been thinking.

09:23.445 --> 09:25.737
I've got a new game plan
for the call.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.111
Uh-huh.

09:27.195 --> 09:29.570
Hey. Can you try and not
look so fuckin' nervous?

09:29.654 --> 09:30.861
I know what I'm doing.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.320
I'm relaxed.

09:32.403 --> 09:34.487
I just think it's a little late,
considering the gravity

09:34.570 --> 09:36.028
and the need to get
the relationship right.

09:36.111 --> 09:39.320
Sure. The-- The new strategy
is really just a refinement

09:39.403 --> 09:41.070
of all this great work.

09:41.153 --> 09:43.153
It goes, uh--

09:43.237 --> 09:46.903
Well, the working title
is "Go Fuck Yourself."

09:46.986 --> 09:48.737
- Uh-huh.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.612
Receptionist :
Hi, I have Mr. Polk.

09:51.695 --> 09:53.487
Uh

09:53.570 --> 09:55.861
I think I need a little bit
more of an explanation.

09:55.945 --> 09:58.820
My dad's a bastard,
they need to know
I'm a bastard, too.

09:58.903 --> 10:00.195
- Right--

10:00.278 --> 10:01.362
Great.

10:01.445 --> 10:03.986
- Hey, Mr. Polk.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.861
Polk :
Hi, Kendall, good to connect.

10:06.945 --> 10:09.986
Likewise. Yeah, great.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.278
So, you

10:15.362 --> 10:16.695
Well, why don't you go?

10:16.779 --> 10:20.779
OK. Well, uh, sure.

10:20.861 --> 10:24.362
We just wanted to make contact,
given where we are.

10:24.445 --> 10:27.278
- Mm-hmm. We are concerned.
- Absolutely.

10:27.362 --> 10:30.070
Now, obviously, look,
the main thing is,

10:30.153 --> 10:32.695
we just handle this very calmly,

10:32.779 --> 10:34.529
because the last thing
either of us want

10:34.612 --> 10:37.028
is for this rather private
arrangement my father made

10:37.111 --> 10:39.986
to, uh, you know, make waves.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.529
- Absolutely.
- But I guess the issue is

10:42.612 --> 10:44.695
we owe you 3.2 billion--

10:44.779 --> 10:46.320
3.25.

10:46.403 --> 10:47.861
Kendall:
Hey, I was rounding down.

10:47.945 --> 10:49.028
We round up.

10:49.111 --> 10:51.861
3.25 billion,

10:51.945 --> 10:53.903
secured against
Waystar stock,

10:53.986 --> 10:57.403
which is, you know, undergoing
some temporary turbulence

10:57.487 --> 10:59.570
due to sector-wide factors.

10:59.654 --> 11:00.820
Mm-hmm.

11:00.903 --> 11:03.695
So, I guess, you know,

11:03.779 --> 11:05.362
what I'd like to know is,

11:05.445 --> 11:07.070
what your position will be

11:07.153 --> 11:09.237
if we have a sustained breach
of the stock price

11:09.320 --> 11:12.403
and we fall out of compliance
with our debt covenant?

11:12.487 --> 11:14.903
OK, well, if the stock drops,

11:14.986 --> 11:16.779
we're entitled to ask
for a payment in full.

11:16.861 --> 11:18.779
Uh-huh, exactly.

11:19.903 --> 11:22.737
Technically, uh, yeah.

11:22.820 --> 11:27.654
So... what will we do here
in reality?

11:27.737 --> 11:30.612
If it breaches 130,
you've broken the covenant

11:30.695 --> 11:32.403
and we will want repayment.

11:32.487 --> 11:34.111
Right.

11:34.195 --> 11:35.737
I know.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.362
But, um, like, really?

11:39.445 --> 11:41.195
Seriously.

11:45.111 --> 11:46.320
OK, I-- I get it.

11:46.403 --> 11:48.278
That's your initial position,

11:48.362 --> 11:50.654
but we will want to restructure,

11:50.737 --> 11:51.861
and, uh--

11:51.945 --> 11:53.737
Look, here's where I'm at.

11:53.820 --> 11:56.237
We're not crazy
about the media sector,

11:56.320 --> 11:59.445
we're not crazy about
how your father has treated
our relationship,

11:59.529 --> 12:01.612
and our position
is to seek recoupment.

12:01.695 --> 12:04.153
Oh, come on, man.
Fuck off.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.820
- I'm here.

12:34.903 --> 12:36.903
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

12:36.986 --> 12:39.695
Real world, can we start
to negotiate?

12:39.779 --> 12:42.362
Listen, son,
that's our position.

12:42.445 --> 12:44.445
If the stock drops below 130,

12:44.529 --> 12:46.861
you're in breach
and we want our money back.

12:46.945 --> 12:49.487
OK, fine. Let's keep talking.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.320
Look, if you need
to talk to me,

12:51.403 --> 12:53.487
maybe it's better if we
go through an intermediary.

12:53.570 --> 12:56.320
I'm not a particular fan
of foul language,

12:56.403 --> 12:58.861
and I don't like
to be insulted.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.237
Thank you, good morning.

13:03.654 --> 13:05.986
- Gerri: Oh, boy.

13:09.779 --> 13:13.362
- Fuck, that was brutal.

13:13.445 --> 13:16.612
Of course I was in.
I'm COO. Oof!

13:16.695 --> 13:19.861
Are
Would they squeeze us?

13:19.945 --> 13:22.320
- Well, obviously they could.

13:22.403 --> 13:24.153
Relax, man,
it'll be fine.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.903
Uh, no, it fuckin'
necessarily won't. OK?

13:26.986 --> 13:28.861
If this became public,

13:28.945 --> 13:31.362
we could nosedive,
we could death spiral here.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.487
Dude, I was only trying
to be nice.

13:33.570 --> 13:36.654
That was a fucking shitshow,
and you handled it like a moron,
is the truth.

13:36.737 --> 13:38.529
Fuck off.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.487
Gents.

13:43.028 --> 13:46.654
Hello.
Uh, Greg Hirsch.

13:46.737 --> 13:49.403
I believe I'm working here
as of today.

13:49.487 --> 13:53.028
OK, what is your job
or job title?

13:53.111 --> 13:57.070
Um, job, not entirely sure,
per se.

13:57.153 --> 13:59.945
Uh... I'll find out.

14:00.028 --> 14:03.737
OK, um, I don't
have anything.

14:03.820 --> 14:08.028
I was actually personally
appointed by Mr. Logan Roy.

14:08.111 --> 14:09.986
OK. Um...

14:11.861 --> 14:14.737
- Um...

14:14.820 --> 14:15.861
Tom?

14:15.945 --> 14:17.070
- Tom.

14:17.153 --> 14:18.570
Last name, uh...

14:18.654 --> 14:21.237
Weird, I don't think
I ever got his last--

14:21.320 --> 14:24.487
Uh, T-- boss Tom...

14:26.070 --> 14:28.737
Tom

14:28.820 --> 14:30.820
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.362
Can you help me?

14:32.445 --> 14:33.695
Can you help--

14:40.195 --> 14:42.570
OK, Greg. Greg Roy?

14:42.654 --> 14:44.237
That's the--
I'm actually a Hirsch.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.445
I'm not a--
My mom's a Roy, but, uh,

14:46.529 --> 14:49.362
I'm basically a Roy
in all-- all but my name.

14:53.695 --> 14:55.403
- Jess: Wait--
- I'll be two minutes.

14:55.487 --> 14:57.237
What? No. No. Shiv--

14:57.320 --> 14:59.779
It has gotten weird.
OK? It has gotten very weird.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.028
- I don't know.

15:07.111 --> 15:09.654
- He might have put on a sock.

15:09.737 --> 15:12.070
Or he could be
lying there dead.
I have no fuckin' idea.

15:12.153 --> 15:13.111
- OK, this is--

15:13.195 --> 15:14.570
It's not a good time.

15:14.654 --> 15:16.153
She thinks that
Marcia's poisoning him.

15:16.237 --> 15:18.237
I do not. Apparently,
he doesn't want to see us.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.487
Not including me?

15:19.570 --> 15:20.779
Why would he say that?

15:20.861 --> 15:22.195
Still pissed at you

15:22.278 --> 15:24.195
for not signing up
to his corporate restructure

15:24.278 --> 15:25.654
to make Marcia
queen of the castle?

15:25.737 --> 15:27.986
OK, yeah.
Maybe she's  pissed.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.779
Look, did you see him
over the weekend?

15:29.861 --> 15:32.153
No. I heard he wasn't
up to seeing people.

15:32.237 --> 15:34.570
Yeah, no one has seen him
since we took him home
from the hospital,

15:34.654 --> 15:35.612
like, Thursday.

15:35.695 --> 15:38.111
I think You saw him,
right?

15:38.195 --> 15:40.570
Uh, sure, yeah,
for, like, five minutes.

15:40.654 --> 15:43.695
But he was, um...
he was pretty--

15:43.779 --> 15:47.362
He wasn't really him  him,
there were tubes and...

15:47.445 --> 15:49.695
- Nope.

15:49.779 --> 15:51.237
No one apart from Marcia
has seen him

15:51.320 --> 15:52.820
for the better part of a week.

15:52.903 --> 15:55.362
- Four days is not a week.
- OK, the majority of the week,

15:55.445 --> 15:57.195
and we're just accepting--
the whole world

15:57.278 --> 15:58.820
is just accepting
this woman's word

15:58.903 --> 16:00.070
that he put on a fucking sock.

16:00.153 --> 16:02.028
Look, relax, OK?

16:02.111 --> 16:03.362
I-It's a process,

16:03.445 --> 16:04.903
we don't want
to rush the recovery...

16:04.986 --> 16:06.945
Oh, right, because
you like playing boss?

16:07.028 --> 16:08.779
That's not...

16:08.861 --> 16:12.195
Please. Can you
go over there?

16:12.278 --> 16:13.529
Shiv, this is--

16:13.612 --> 16:15.986
I literally have something
unmissable.

16:19.861 --> 16:22.487
Later. OK?
I'll try later.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.445
- OK.

16:25.737 --> 16:27.362
Is everything OK?

16:27.445 --> 16:30.362
No. We are on the brink
of total corporate collapse.

16:30.445 --> 16:32.237
Oh, yeah.
Well, that figures.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.320
Well, call me
if you go Lehman, will you?

16:34.403 --> 16:36.028
Might want
some of these chairs.

17:00.779 --> 17:01.737
Morning.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.320
Morning.

17:03.403 --> 17:06.028
Here to help fix
the Death Star.

17:06.111 --> 17:08.028
"Grill on the exhaust vent,
guys,

17:08.111 --> 17:09.654
grill on the exhaust vent."

17:11.695 --> 17:14.779
Karolina:
So, my only concern would be,
to brief this meeting,

17:14.861 --> 17:16.861
is it a little too aggressive

17:16.945 --> 17:18.278
for a temporary CEO?

17:18.362 --> 17:19.779
That is a good point.

17:19.861 --> 17:21.654
Yeah, well, we've got
a very aggressive drop

17:21.737 --> 17:23.903
in our share price, so I think
that's appropriate, good?

17:23.986 --> 17:25.945
So brief this wide
and brief it fast, OK?

17:26.028 --> 17:27.861
- OK.
- Uh, yeah. Great.

17:33.612 --> 17:35.737
All right, all right!

17:35.820 --> 17:38.153
Morning, morning, morning.

17:38.237 --> 17:39.945
Hey, hey, hey.

17:40.028 --> 17:41.945
My people.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.612
It's great to see you all.

17:43.695 --> 17:47.111
You know my brother and I,
CEO and COO...

17:47.195 --> 17:50.153
- Roman: COO.
- Gerri, Karl, Karolina.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.153
Um...

17:51.237 --> 17:52.487
I'm actually gonna stand up,

17:52.570 --> 17:53.779
if that's all right.

17:53.861 --> 17:57.654
My back is fucked.
I have a new trainer, so...

17:57.737 --> 18:01.820
So, I just wanted to
get the gang together
early in my tenure

18:01.903 --> 18:05.153
to say, uh... "Yo."

18:05.237 --> 18:08.237
You're probably all wondering
about my dad.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.903
He's doing OK.

18:09.986 --> 18:11.654
Motherfucker.

18:11.737 --> 18:13.487
We're hoping for
a full recovery.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.570
He's, like,
a thousand percent better,
though.

18:15.654 --> 18:17.570
He's like a bull
in rhino hide.

18:17.654 --> 18:19.695
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Slow and steady.

18:19.779 --> 18:22.612
This morning
he put on a sock, so...

18:22.695 --> 18:26.861
That's right. Uh, this morning
he tried to put on a sock.

18:29.362 --> 18:31.945
And welcome to Tom Wamsgans,

18:32.028 --> 18:34.487
who was managing Resorts
South and Central

18:34.570 --> 18:36.445
and is now sitting up
with the grownups.

18:36.529 --> 18:38.362
- Hey. I just want--
- So, what I want to announce

18:38.445 --> 18:40.529
to you all this morning
is a new strategic vision.

18:40.612 --> 18:43.403
We have a great firm here.

18:43.487 --> 18:45.070
Multifaceted.

18:45.153 --> 18:46.695
Parks, cruises,

18:46.779 --> 18:50.695
telecom, live entertainment,
sports--

18:50.779 --> 18:52.529
but at the heart, media.

18:52.612 --> 18:55.362
TV, movies, books, newspapers.

18:55.445 --> 19:00.403
And what we're fighting for
is eyeballs, eyeballs which we
convert to our customer base,

19:00.487 --> 19:03.362
eyeballs which we crate up
and sell to advertisers.

19:03.445 --> 19:07.028
Right? And bottom line,
we're losing...

19:07.111 --> 19:09.861
to monopolistic disruptors.

19:09.945 --> 19:12.111
Alphabet, Facebook...

19:12.195 --> 19:14.195
Internet.
Fucking game-changer, man.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.153
- That's right, the internet.
- Roman: Internet.

19:17.237 --> 19:21.570
But, uh, we are still just--
just--  in a position

19:21.654 --> 19:24.403
to leverage our brands into
something in the new landscape.

19:24.487 --> 19:26.861
But if we don't,
we're gonna be like

19:26.945 --> 19:30.570
the biggest fuckin' horse trader
in Detroit, 1909. OK?

19:30.654 --> 19:33.403
We need
a more dynamic strategy.

19:33.487 --> 19:36.070
Now, let's call it,
for the sake of clarity,

19:36.153 --> 19:38.570
the Strategy
of a Thousand Lifeboats.

19:38.654 --> 19:41.654
Vaulter is a lifeboat,

19:41.737 --> 19:44.737
ATN Citizens is a lifeboat.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.070
There are no bad lifeboats.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.903
VR could be a lifeboat.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.737
VR's a bubble,

19:50.820 --> 19:53.320
but yeah. No bad ideas.

19:53.403 --> 19:54.737
Porn could be a lifeboat.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.945
Except that.
That's a bad lifeboat.

19:59.028 --> 20:01.111
Hey, thanks, Rome.

20:01.195 --> 20:02.695
Look, this isn't a brainstorm,

20:02.779 --> 20:05.237
all I'm saying,
everyone's invited. OK?

20:05.320 --> 20:07.111
I want each and every one of you

20:07.195 --> 20:09.487
to be innovating, challenging,

20:09.570 --> 20:11.612
being bold, being disruptive,

20:11.695 --> 20:15.028
bringing me new, original,
multiplatform content.

20:15.111 --> 20:17.945
Bring me more
in the interactive
and digital space.

20:18.028 --> 20:19.612
Bring me franchiseable IP.

20:19.695 --> 20:22.195
Bring me a thousand lifeboats.

20:22.278 --> 20:24.445
Bring me a fucking armada
of eyeballs.

20:24.529 --> 20:27.487
Because steady as she goes
hits the iceberg.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.362
All right.
Thanks, everyone.

20:31.445 --> 20:33.945
Lifeboats! Whoo!

20:40.654 --> 20:42.487
Just had to say,
that was great. Kudos.

20:42.570 --> 20:45.111
Always here if you need
a friendly ear,

20:45.195 --> 20:46.779
Lord Vader.

20:46.861 --> 20:48.320
Just get shit moving
at Parks.

20:48.403 --> 20:49.654
- Yes.

20:49.737 --> 20:50.986
It's stagnant,

20:51.070 --> 20:53.237
so shake that fuckin' tree,
C3PO.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.654
Shakin' the tree.
Shakin' the tree.

20:55.737 --> 20:57.779
Shakin' it big time.

20:59.986 --> 21:01.945
Uh, Fiona.
Walk with me.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.153
Can you send flowers to Rava?

21:04.237 --> 21:06.654
Nice, but, you know,
not ridiculous.

21:06.737 --> 21:09.529
They should smell like flowers,
not desperation.

21:09.612 --> 21:11.195
Oh, and Fi, talk to Jess,

21:11.278 --> 21:13.861
I might want to throw
a couple of items up
on the internal.

21:13.945 --> 21:15.820
Not a big deal,
couple of TED talks.

21:15.903 --> 21:19.487
Maybe a documentary
on the Epic of Gilgamesh,
I'm thinking?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.362
You know,
it's the first story,
archetypal quest shit.

21:22.445 --> 21:25.070
Because what are we
if not storytellers?

21:26.737 --> 21:27.945
Hey. Talk to me.

21:28.028 --> 21:29.278
Down three points,

21:29.362 --> 21:30.861
and there's an AP headline

21:30.945 --> 21:33.445
"CEO tells staff
Waystar headed for iceberg."

21:33.529 --> 21:37.195
Not iceberg, lifeboats.
I said lifeboats, not iceberg!

21:37.278 --> 21:39.612
- Jesus! Karolina.
- That's what we're pushing.

21:39.695 --> 21:41.111
- Push harder.
- Will do.

21:41.195 --> 21:43.320
Gerri:
I want to talk options
to you, OK?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.779
I've got some thoughts
I've been working on
for a long time--

21:45.861 --> 21:48.612
OK, I don't want
the sloppy seconds, Gerri.
I'm taking five to think big.

21:48.695 --> 21:50.612
Ken, these are modeled
and thought through--

21:50.695 --> 21:52.237
And rejected.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.695
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm talking a walk,

21:53.779 --> 21:55.028
I need to get
some altitude on this.

21:55.111 --> 21:56.403
I'll be back.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.986
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.

23:01.654 --> 23:03.695
( undoes belt,
unzips )

23:30.737 --> 23:32.403
Man:
The thing about capitalism is,
yeah, sure,

23:32.487 --> 23:33.903
it's got its issues,
but fuck me--

23:33.986 --> 23:36.195
this is a piece of shit chain
on a stretch of nothing,

23:36.278 --> 23:40.654
but this-- this is
the most delicious thing
anyone's ever fucking tasted.

23:40.737 --> 23:42.779
Oh, my God. Thank you.

23:42.861 --> 23:45.195
- Thank you.
- Kendall: So dude, listen.

23:45.278 --> 23:47.362
- I could do with a read

23:47.445 --> 23:49.903
from someone without
a dog in the fight.

23:49.986 --> 23:52.278
Actually, I gotta
talk to you about
something, too.

23:52.362 --> 23:53.529
This is tight.

23:53.612 --> 23:55.529
This is absolutely
just us, OK?

23:55.612 --> 23:56.945
Because a leak kills me.

23:57.028 --> 23:59.237
Right.
This is about Rava.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.153
- For a pal.

24:01.237 --> 24:02.445
Yeah, it's a mutual friend,

24:02.529 --> 24:03.986
and they want to know
is it cool,

24:04.070 --> 24:06.820
or you still hankerin'
for a wankerin'?

24:08.111 --> 24:09.529
I don't have time for this.

24:09.612 --> 24:11.487
I mean, who

24:11.570 --> 24:13.779
- I can't say.

24:13.861 --> 24:15.986
But they just want
to know if it's an issue.

24:16.070 --> 24:17.903
Like who, fuckin' Paul?

24:17.986 --> 24:21.445
Well, if you're asking,
I'm assuming
it's a fucking issue.

24:21.529 --> 24:25.195
No, I mean, look,
we're separated,
you know?

24:25.278 --> 24:27.529
Whatever.
Free agents.

24:27.612 --> 24:29.445
Yeah. No, I get it.

24:29.529 --> 24:30.612
I'm gonna have another.

24:30.695 --> 24:32.570
You know, if you
eat it fast enough

24:32.654 --> 24:34.195
it actually burns off
the calories.

24:34.278 --> 24:35.195
It's like a loophole.

24:35.278 --> 24:37.487
Can I have another, please?

24:37.570 --> 24:40.028
So, listen,
when I took over...

24:40.111 --> 24:43.903
found out Dad
took out a huge loan

24:43.986 --> 24:46.779
a decade ago. Secret.
Through the holding company.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.153
Are you serious?

24:48.237 --> 24:49.237
Secured against
the family's stake

24:49.320 --> 24:50.529
in the public firm.

24:50.612 --> 24:51.903
Fuck. Dude.

24:51.986 --> 24:54.028
Yeah. Now the stock
is getting ready to breach,

24:54.111 --> 24:56.028
- and the bank are...
- Yeah, I know, I saw the price.

24:56.111 --> 24:59.111
It's brutal.
Who's the bank?

24:59.195 --> 25:01.403
Mm-hmm. I'm just
gonna do this.

25:01.487 --> 25:03.529
Dude...

25:03.612 --> 25:05.570
we're not at Buckley
anymore. Jesus.

25:05.654 --> 25:06.903
It's fine.

25:06.986 --> 25:09.487
So, these guys
have your dick in a vise.

25:10.612 --> 25:12.737
Yes. Thank you, Stewy.

25:12.820 --> 25:15.487
- Mm-hmm.

25:15.570 --> 25:18.237
Well, number one,
you boost the price.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.237
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
- OK.

25:20.320 --> 25:22.278
- I'm trying.
- OK.

25:22.362 --> 25:25.320
How's it gonna play
for us to refinance?

25:25.403 --> 25:26.986
Honestly? Not great.

25:27.070 --> 25:31.195
Why won't your original bank
step up? Not good.

25:31.278 --> 25:34.237
People don't love the sector,
and they don't love
the fucking firm.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.945
It's ramshackle, is the view.

25:36.028 --> 25:39.945
And bro,
they don't love... you.

25:40.028 --> 25:41.487
It's tough.

25:56.028 --> 25:57.195
Ah, fuck it.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.612
OK! I am open for business.

26:03.695 --> 26:05.445
You know, one thing occurs.

26:05.529 --> 26:08.111
Just blue sky,
wouldn't happen
in a million years,

26:08.195 --> 26:10.153
but what if

26:10.237 --> 26:12.278
we came in,

26:12.362 --> 26:15.237
took the whole thing
off your family's hands?

26:17.570 --> 26:20.529
Uh, well, obviously no,

26:20.612 --> 26:23.820
fuck off, how dare you,
I'm so insulted, et cetera.

26:23.903 --> 26:26.986
Of course. But you
and Roman and Shiv,

26:27.070 --> 26:30.445
you're gonna do that thing
forever? No.

26:30.529 --> 26:33.654
You all have the chance
to be fucking...

26:33.737 --> 26:37.278
fucking, like,
ugly petro-ruble rich.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.695
You can do anything.

26:38.779 --> 26:39.903
You can go into tech,

26:39.986 --> 26:41.737
Shiv can do her politics
or whatever,

26:41.820 --> 26:44.695
and Roman can, you know,
snort his body weight.

26:44.779 --> 26:47.153
And you all live
unhappily ever after.

26:47.237 --> 26:48.612
Uh-huh. Thanks, Stewy.

26:48.695 --> 26:50.028
Just think about it.

26:59.445 --> 27:02.028
Tom:
Can I get the senior team
together tomorrow

27:02.111 --> 27:03.695
for a reorientation?

27:03.779 --> 27:06.111
Shakin' the tree, folks,
shakin' the tree.

27:07.737 --> 27:09.529
Excuse me.

27:09.612 --> 27:11.945
Greg

27:13.278 --> 27:14.237
Hey, Tom.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.654
Forgive me, but, uh...

27:15.737 --> 27:17.612
we talkin' to each other
on the poop deck

27:17.695 --> 27:20.153
of a majestic schooner?

27:20.237 --> 27:23.861
Is the salty brine
stinging my weather

27:23.945 --> 27:25.529
No?

27:25.612 --> 27:27.278
Then why the fuck
are you wearing

27:27.362 --> 27:28.403
a pair of deck shoes, man?

27:28.487 --> 27:30.737
Oh-- Yeah-- No, well,

27:30.820 --> 27:34.362
my credit card got maxed out,
I'm staying in a youth hostel

27:34.445 --> 27:37.654
- on, like, $80 a day--
- Jesus. How squalid.

27:37.737 --> 27:39.320
Dude, are you
carrying dog shit?

27:41.195 --> 27:44.028
No-- No, it's, uh...

27:44.111 --> 27:46.070
it's free, right?

27:46.153 --> 27:47.237
Is that cool? I mean,

27:47.320 --> 27:49.529
I don't wanna be melodramatic,

27:49.612 --> 27:53.320
but my body is growing weak
due to a lack of sustenance.

27:53.403 --> 27:55.237
But in a dog poop baggie?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.779
Yeah, I have
a bunch of 'em

27:56.861 --> 27:58.779
- from back home--
- Greg, that's disgusting.

27:58.861 --> 28:00.445
Not really.

28:00.529 --> 28:03.070
It's not like
they pre-poop them
or something,

28:03.153 --> 28:05.362
like, it's not like--
they're just bags, really.

28:05.445 --> 28:07.070
It's just a mental barrier.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.153
A pair of cap-toe Oxfords,
Crockett & Jones, ASAP.

28:10.237 --> 28:12.570
Lucinda, can we figure out
where we might put

28:12.654 --> 28:14.487
the talented Mr. Greg?

28:38.654 --> 28:40.903
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.654
- Nathaniel.
- Siobhan.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.111
Uh, yeah, good.
Busy.

28:48.195 --> 28:49.903
Right.

28:52.070 --> 28:53.445
So, is this...?

28:53.529 --> 28:54.945
Work.

28:55.028 --> 28:58.195
- OK. Of course.
- Yeah.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.362
- Work.

29:00.445 --> 29:04.237
A little work meeting
on the bed of a four-star hotel.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.695
Get your mind
out of the gutter.

29:05.779 --> 29:07.654
OK.

29:07.737 --> 29:11.445
How's it goin'
workin' with... Joyce?

29:11.529 --> 29:15.028
That tall glass of tepid water
from Albany.

29:15.111 --> 29:16.529
It's great. Yeah.

29:16.612 --> 29:19.820
How's the, uh,
poor man's Fidel Castro?

29:19.903 --> 29:22.570
Senior senator from
the state of 1975.

29:22.654 --> 29:24.487
How's that
workin' out for ya?

29:24.570 --> 29:26.237
Better. Zing!

29:29.070 --> 29:32.111
I wondered if you
could do me a favor.

29:32.195 --> 29:33.529
Do I owe you a favor?

29:33.612 --> 29:34.820
Yeah, 'cause I deigned
to date you.

29:34.903 --> 29:37.612
You deigned.
That's nice.

29:37.695 --> 29:39.362
And I thought
we were gonna be friends.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.153
Sure. I wanna be friends.

29:42.237 --> 29:43.570
Good.

29:43.654 --> 29:45.737
I need a background check
on somebody.

29:45.820 --> 29:48.570
Well, that might cause
some ethical issues.

29:48.654 --> 29:51.861
'Cause there's a world
where my guy and your gal

29:51.945 --> 29:54.779
end up in the mud wrestling
for the Democratic nomination.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.695
No, it's not political.

29:56.779 --> 30:00.945
I need background on someone
off the record.

30:01.028 --> 30:03.779
- Uh, Marcia.
- Marcia.

30:03.861 --> 30:05.779
- The wicked stepmother.
- Yeah.

30:05.861 --> 30:07.945
It occurred to me
a few years too late

30:08.028 --> 30:09.612
that I don't really
know anything about her.

30:09.695 --> 30:11.028
So... just due diligence.

30:11.111 --> 30:13.403
- Well, um,

30:13.487 --> 30:16.986
I know a really horrible guy

30:17.070 --> 30:19.487
who's incredibly expensive.

30:19.570 --> 30:22.070
OK. Yeah,
that sounds great. OK.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.070
- Yes, milady.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.070
OK.

30:31.820 --> 30:33.737
- "Deigned."
- Yeah.

30:33.820 --> 30:35.570
Did you see  the women
I dated after you?

30:35.654 --> 30:37.612
Yeah. They only dated you
because you dated me.

30:37.695 --> 30:40.861
They were like,
"Oh, I guess he
must have something."

30:44.861 --> 30:47.570
Woman on video:
Waystar diversity
and harassment policy.

30:47.654 --> 30:49.903
Waystar Royco has worked hard
to develop a tolerant

30:49.986 --> 30:51.403
and respectful workplace.

30:51.487 --> 30:52.903
The company
is strongly committed

30:52.986 --> 30:53.945
to making employment decisions

30:54.028 --> 30:55.737
based on valid requirements

30:55.820 --> 30:59.237
and without regards to race,
religion, national origin,

30:59.320 --> 31:00.903
ancestry, gender,
gender identity,

31:00.986 --> 31:02.570
gender expression,
sex preference,

31:02.654 --> 31:05.903
sexual orientation,
physical or mental disability,

31:05.986 --> 31:07.945
military status,
marital status,

31:08.028 --> 31:10.070
or any other status as is
protected by applicable law.

31:10.153 --> 31:12.278
Where the law requires
affirmative action programs,

31:12.362 --> 31:15.445
the company will strive
to comply with the provisions
of those laws.

31:15.529 --> 31:17.028
Thank you for your attention.

31:17.111 --> 31:20.903
Welcome to your new future
at Waystar Royco.

31:20.986 --> 31:23.278
All: Feel it!

31:23.362 --> 31:26.278
- Gerri: Hey.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.654
- We're down two more points.
- Fuck.

31:28.737 --> 31:31.320
Listen, Sandy Furness is here.

31:32.861 --> 31:34.695
- I mean, he's here,

31:34.779 --> 31:36.320
- in the building.
- He can't do that.

31:36.403 --> 31:39.529
Fucking Pepsi doesn't just
drop in to see Coke.

31:39.612 --> 31:41.070
Put him where
no one can see him.

31:41.153 --> 31:43.028
South tank. I'm right here.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.820
Sharks are circling.

31:47.903 --> 31:50.320
Your father
would shoot him on sight.

31:50.403 --> 31:52.237
You know, I don't need
to hear what my father
would do right now.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.320
He's not here.
- Right.

31:54.403 --> 31:55.737
- I'm gonna handle it.
- He's not here.

31:57.195 --> 31:59.028
Mr. Furness, what a surprise.

31:59.111 --> 32:01.487
- So kind of you to drop by.
- Oh, not at all.

32:01.570 --> 32:04.487
I just came to say
how sorry I was
to hear about your dad.

32:04.570 --> 32:06.779
Well, it's so kind of you
to do it in person

32:06.861 --> 32:08.153
when you could have just called.

32:08.237 --> 32:09.654
Thank you.

32:09.737 --> 32:12.445
Well, I hope I didn't send
the birds a-tweeting,

32:12.529 --> 32:15.487
what with all
the uncertainty
and whatnot.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.529
We'll make sure people know
it's just friendly.

32:17.612 --> 32:19.820
And you'll give your dad
my best, tell him I stopped by?

32:19.903 --> 32:21.320
Of course. Sure.

32:21.403 --> 32:25.278
Maybe when that news is, uh...
less likely to kill him.

32:25.362 --> 32:28.654
OK, well,

32:28.737 --> 32:31.111
thank you. I do--
I appreciate this.

32:31.195 --> 32:32.612
Oh, and just to say,

32:32.695 --> 32:35.779
if, um, I can give you
any advice,

32:35.861 --> 32:37.695
I'm just watching
the wheels nowadays,

32:37.779 --> 32:39.529
so if you want to
run anything by me

32:39.612 --> 32:41.362
as an honest broker,
use me.

32:41.445 --> 32:43.362
A mentor.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.861
That is a very kind offer.

32:45.945 --> 32:49.362
Well, there's probably
a million options
with our two firms.

32:49.445 --> 32:53.237
Swaps, acquisitions,
cooperative interactions.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.695
You know, smart stuff

32:54.779 --> 32:57.362
only a young man like you
can conceive of.

32:58.945 --> 33:00.529
Well, Sandy,

33:00.612 --> 33:02.529
you've been pretty smart.

33:02.612 --> 33:04.612
Smarter than the regulators,
anyway.

33:04.695 --> 33:07.695
Tell you what's smart:
Vaulter.

33:07.779 --> 33:09.861
I don't care
what the wise apples say.

33:15.028 --> 33:17.654
Well, uh, I've got a thing.

33:19.278 --> 33:22.278
Hey, Jess, will you
take Mr. Furness down?

33:22.362 --> 33:26.570
Look at you. Right in the eye
of the raging storm and...

33:26.654 --> 33:28.779
and cool as a cucumber.

33:30.111 --> 33:33.111
Stay strong.
Stay in touch.

33:35.612 --> 33:36.945
Um...

33:45.153 --> 33:46.820
- Yeah.

33:46.903 --> 33:49.487
He said I was
dead in the water
without him

33:49.570 --> 33:51.070
and tried
to finger-bang me.

33:51.153 --> 33:53.529
What'd you say?

33:53.612 --> 33:55.903
Said I'd rather
eat my own shit.

34:02.654 --> 34:04.529
Stock's gone below 130.

34:23.278 --> 34:26.111
Kendall :
You know sometimes
you leave the party

34:26.195 --> 34:28.570
and you wonder what everyone's
saying about you?

34:28.654 --> 34:31.986
With me it's usually
"Who's that young Han Solo

34:32.070 --> 34:33.820
and how do I get his dick
in my ass?"

34:33.903 --> 34:36.779
Like, I know
what they say about me.

34:36.861 --> 34:38.695
Roman: What?

34:38.779 --> 34:40.403
That. See that?

34:40.487 --> 34:42.945
That's how much
people don't like me.

34:43.028 --> 34:45.070
Hey, that's me too.
Don't leave me out.

34:45.153 --> 34:47.320
Gerri:
The truth is,

34:47.403 --> 34:49.903
we call their bluff,
which may not be a bluff,

34:49.986 --> 34:52.779
and the debt becomes public,
and we lose control.

34:52.861 --> 34:55.362
Or we get the stock up,
which we can't,

34:55.445 --> 34:57.320
because we can't "magic" that,

34:57.403 --> 34:59.028
or we pay the bank back,

34:59.111 --> 35:01.529
which, I mean,
to realize that much cash...

35:01.612 --> 35:03.570
stock sell-down,
which is horrible.

35:03.654 --> 35:04.861
There is no good option.

35:07.403 --> 35:09.320
Can I suggest we all
take our shirts off?

35:09.403 --> 35:10.695
OK. Kendall?

35:10.779 --> 35:13.320
They can write
a fucking algorithm

35:13.403 --> 35:15.445
to run this place,
but that's not the answer.

35:15.529 --> 35:17.237
That's not us.

35:17.320 --> 35:20.028
So... break shit up.

35:20.111 --> 35:22.153
Like, just disrupt.

35:23.945 --> 35:25.403
What are you doing?

35:25.487 --> 35:27.487
Takin' my shirt off.
That's all.

35:29.111 --> 35:30.945
Ken, make him
put his shirt on.

35:32.237 --> 35:34.153
I don't-- uh, I don't--

35:34.237 --> 35:38.028
- I don't fuckin' know. I--
- Roman: Shirt off.

35:38.111 --> 35:39.028
Shirt off.

35:39.111 --> 35:40.529
Shirts off.

35:40.612 --> 35:42.320
Shirts off.

35:42.403 --> 35:43.612
How about your jacket off?

35:43.695 --> 35:45.695
Come on, man.

35:45.779 --> 35:48.028
Yeah, all right. All right.

35:48.111 --> 35:49.153
Good.

35:49.237 --> 35:51.237
That's all. Let's go.

35:52.861 --> 35:54.570
- OK.
- Kendall: So...

35:54.654 --> 35:58.820
worst position, we sell down
the stock, we survive.

35:58.903 --> 36:00.986
Maybe we cut a title or two
from physical production,

36:01.070 --> 36:02.320
newspaper-wise.
Online only.

36:02.403 --> 36:04.070
I like that.

36:04.153 --> 36:06.695
That is a $20 million solution
to a billion dollar problem.

36:06.779 --> 36:09.903
Yeah, but it's the right
direction of travel.
That feels right to me.

36:09.986 --> 36:13.529
If you want stuff that works
for the price: layoffs.

36:13.612 --> 36:16.278
Yum-yum. Blood! Yes!

36:16.362 --> 36:18.487
See? Shirts-off shit.

36:18.570 --> 36:21.195
I guess it could be a package.
Layoffs, sell-offs.

36:21.278 --> 36:22.820
Gerri:
Structured retreat?

36:22.903 --> 36:25.362
Well, yeah,
but with a philosophy.

36:25.445 --> 36:27.028
- OK.
- Roman: Yeah.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.945
I mean,
- Kendall: OK.

36:30.028 --> 36:33.612
I guess we just have
to ask or, you know, tell Dad.

36:40.861 --> 36:41.945
Hey, guys.

36:42.028 --> 36:43.945
- Finally.
- Hi.

36:44.028 --> 36:46.278
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

36:46.362 --> 36:47.487
What's up, slugger?

36:47.570 --> 36:49.278
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:49.362 --> 36:50.737
Thanks for joining us.

36:50.820 --> 36:52.195
Actually,
I can't stay long.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.487
Apparently goes for us, too.

36:53.570 --> 36:55.195
Aunt Marcia
won't let us see Grandpa.

36:55.278 --> 36:57.278
- Huh.

37:01.445 --> 37:03.695
- Hey, Marcia.
- Kendall.

37:05.278 --> 37:06.529
How are you?

37:06.612 --> 37:07.903
- Good.
- Good.

37:09.195 --> 37:11.111
How's he doing?
Is he OK?

37:11.195 --> 37:13.278
He's improving.
He's really improving.

37:13.362 --> 37:14.654
- Great.
- Yeah.

37:14.737 --> 37:17.195
'Cause I should probably
let him know something.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.737
He's resting.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.529
I'm sorry,
it's not a good time.

37:20.612 --> 37:22.028
OK.

37:24.237 --> 37:26.570
Well, it's just
when my assistant called--

37:26.654 --> 37:28.320
She spoke with Joan, not me.

37:28.403 --> 37:30.070
- Got it.
- Yeah.

37:30.153 --> 37:34.487
Well, uh, let him know,
will you, that I stopped by,

37:34.570 --> 37:37.403
wanted to talk to him,
keep him abreast of moves?

37:37.487 --> 37:41.153
If you like, you can tell me,
I'll pass it on.

37:41.237 --> 37:43.153
Um...

37:43.237 --> 37:47.028
will you just tell him
that we're...

37:47.111 --> 37:51.695
um, we're retreating,
tactically.

37:54.195 --> 37:55.820
Well, that doesn't
sound right.

37:55.903 --> 37:59.903
Not retreating, quite, but...

37:59.986 --> 38:02.445
It's hard to explain.

38:02.529 --> 38:04.945
I'm sure you're doing
the right thing.

38:07.278 --> 38:09.945
- OK, thanks. See you soon.
- See you.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.612
You know how, like,
everyone hates you?

38:29.695 --> 38:32.362
Well, no, that's not
something I'm aware of.

38:32.445 --> 38:33.612
Oh, sure. They do.

38:33.695 --> 38:36.028
Private equity,
getting your meat hooks in,

38:36.111 --> 38:40.195
chiseling your profit
like a vampire locust fuck.

38:40.278 --> 38:42.403
What is this?
Is this a roast?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.070
Because I have shit to do.

38:44.153 --> 38:45.654
- I've had an idea.
- OK.

38:45.737 --> 38:48.320
How about
instead of taking us over,
you give me $4 billion?

38:50.195 --> 38:51.945
I stay boss,

38:52.028 --> 38:54.529
you stop raiding
shitty companies for scraps,

38:54.612 --> 38:58.070
you invest, for once,
in a blue-chip corporation,

38:58.153 --> 39:00.737
one that is currently,
you know, undervalued

39:00.820 --> 39:02.737
because of some
unfounded concerns

39:02.820 --> 39:05.403
about its leadership, i.e.,
Little Lord Fuckleroy here,

39:05.487 --> 39:08.111
the story twists...
happy ending for all.

39:08.195 --> 39:09.945
Oh ho ho!

39:11.986 --> 39:14.570
- Yeah.

39:14.654 --> 39:17.570
I have a hangover.
And it's bigger than normal.

39:17.654 --> 39:19.820
Why don't we do what we did
back in the day,

39:19.903 --> 39:22.320
let's go to the bathroom,
have a little sumthin'-sumthin',

39:22.403 --> 39:24.903
just knock out a few ideas,
just bash 'em out.

39:24.986 --> 39:26.986
- No. Not for me.
- Of course.

39:27.070 --> 39:28.861
Yeah, yeah, of course.

39:28.945 --> 39:31.529
Do you mind if I have, like,
just like a taste of it?

39:33.695 --> 39:34.779
Really, dude?

39:36.570 --> 39:37.820
Ooh.

39:37.903 --> 39:39.695
Yeah. Mm-kay.

39:39.779 --> 39:41.570
- Uh, no.

39:41.654 --> 39:45.111
Obviously, I don't generally
take a minority stake
in a public company.

39:45.195 --> 39:48.612
Yeah, obviously,
because you're a parasite.

39:48.695 --> 39:49.986
Mm-hmm.

39:50.070 --> 39:52.028
How about for once
you make things bigger?

39:52.111 --> 39:53.903
You know,
with your old pal?

39:56.695 --> 39:58.903
- Yeah.

39:58.986 --> 40:02.779
Well, I can't even begin
to think about this.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.612
But if I could...

40:05.695 --> 40:07.820
to sell it,
I'm gonna need voting stock.

40:07.903 --> 40:10.986
As long as the family
maintain control?

40:11.070 --> 40:14.153
Well, effective control.
I'm also gonna need
a board seat.

40:14.237 --> 40:17.237
Oh, I'd force it on you,
dude. For the optics.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.278
Shit hot new CEO
has some hot shit new money
for investment.

40:21.362 --> 40:22.737
New generation.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.695
I keep the debt
out of the news.

40:24.779 --> 40:28.070
Fuckin' sisters doin' it
for theyselves.

40:28.153 --> 40:32.945
I'm not necessarily
totally opposed to this notion.

40:33.028 --> 40:35.111
That's right, and luckily
I speak Stewy,

40:35.195 --> 40:38.195
and that's Stewy for
"I have a fuckin'
raging hard-on for this."

40:38.278 --> 40:40.612
Greg. Come on, buddy.

40:40.695 --> 40:43.153
First meeting of
the senior management cadre.

40:43.237 --> 40:44.487
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, come on.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.278
Uh, great. Great stuff.
Great.

40:46.362 --> 40:49.861
You know, I was lookin' through
employee emails,

40:49.945 --> 40:51.195
which, by the way,
is totally legal,

40:51.278 --> 40:54.237
and, uh, does my breath smell?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
Honestly?

40:56.403 --> 40:59.028
No, no. No, I mean,
it smells of breath,

40:59.111 --> 41:00.320
but--

41:00.403 --> 41:02.195
You know, there's
too much drift in Parks.

41:02.278 --> 41:03.737
I'm gonna shake that tree.

41:03.820 --> 41:06.195
I might punch-bag you
a little, is that cool?

41:06.278 --> 41:07.861
Sure. As in,

41:07.945 --> 41:09.695
like, punch-- Yeah.

41:09.779 --> 41:10.737
Morning, people.

41:10.820 --> 41:13.529
Kick-off. Ahem.

41:13.612 --> 41:15.070
Here's a question.

41:17.111 --> 41:19.570
Here we are, out in
the Theme Park Division,

41:19.654 --> 41:22.362
but tell me this:

41:22.445 --> 41:26.153
if you could really do anything,
professionally,

41:26.237 --> 41:29.320
and work anywhere,
where would that be?

41:34.654 --> 41:36.028
Excuse me.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.028
Uh-huh. Oh, no. Shiv.

41:42.111 --> 41:44.820
I'm in the middle
of the first m-meeting.

41:47.153 --> 41:48.779
Well, it's hard--

41:50.320 --> 41:52.278
Connor's flying in?

41:52.362 --> 41:55.237
OK. OK.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.362
All right, bye. Right.

41:58.612 --> 42:00.070
Fuck!

42:00.153 --> 42:02.945
- Yeah, no need to tell Ken.

42:03.028 --> 42:04.362
Is that legal?

42:04.445 --> 42:06.529
You don't need to know.

42:06.612 --> 42:08.861
Um, hey...

42:08.945 --> 42:11.695
can anybody do that on anybody?

42:11.779 --> 42:14.861
OK, so, first husband,
Lebanese businessman.

42:14.945 --> 42:16.612
- Tom: Yeah, I remember.
- Right.

42:16.695 --> 42:19.445
They had the high life in Paris,
lot of parties, with pols,

42:19.529 --> 42:22.570
and writers, and also
a lot of shitbags and slimeballs

42:22.654 --> 42:25.487
- and arms dealers, oil guys.
- Wow.

42:25.570 --> 42:28.779
- Well, further back...

42:28.861 --> 42:30.320
further back is complicated.

42:30.403 --> 42:31.654
There's no leads.

42:31.737 --> 42:33.779
- Yeah.

42:33.861 --> 42:36.445
- Is that...
Yes.

42:36.529 --> 42:37.612
- Ominous, yes.
- Yeah.

42:37.695 --> 42:38.861
It's apparently
a little weird.

42:38.945 --> 42:40.445
And there are
two possibilities.

42:40.529 --> 42:42.237
Either she came
from kind of nowhere,

42:42.320 --> 42:43.570
Tripoli, Lebanon,

42:43.654 --> 42:46.278
turns up in Paris,
age 31,

42:46.362 --> 42:47.612
a publishing assistant,

42:47.695 --> 42:49.237
and then just marries this guy.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.529
- Fine.
- Or.

42:50.612 --> 42:53.903
- Or... cleanup job.

42:55.237 --> 42:56.320
Oh! Hey, Marcia.

42:56.403 --> 42:57.861
Great impression of a cuckoo.

42:57.945 --> 42:59.320
Door opens, and there you are.

42:59.403 --> 43:01.654
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

43:01.737 --> 43:04.986
Yeah, hi. This is Connor,
Logan's firstborn son,
you remember him?

43:05.070 --> 43:06.820
And this is Tom, my partner,
and together

43:06.903 --> 43:09.570
they're over 12 feet
of We Would Like
To See Him, Please.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.820
Are you trying to force entry,
is that it?

43:11.903 --> 43:13.654
Oh, boy. I thought
we were just
stopping by.

43:13.737 --> 43:16.320
I usually try
to avoid confrontation.
Let's all breathe.

43:16.403 --> 43:18.695
He simply isn't
up to visitors.

43:18.779 --> 43:20.320
Is this about me signing
some pieces of paper? Or...

43:20.403 --> 43:21.695
Oh, please, Shiv.

43:21.779 --> 43:24.278
It's very difficult as it is.

43:24.362 --> 43:25.986
Oh, the fuckin' waterworks?

43:26.070 --> 43:27.945
Is that it?
You're gonna cry now? Please.

43:31.487 --> 43:33.487
- Siobhan.

43:33.570 --> 43:36.362
I can't believe
you would try and stop me
seeing my father.

43:36.445 --> 43:39.278
And I can't believe
you will try
against his wishes.

43:44.779 --> 43:46.570
Hi. Dad.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.529
Hey.

43:50.612 --> 43:51.779
Can you?

43:54.820 --> 43:57.028
Hey.

43:57.111 --> 43:58.820
How are you feeling?

43:58.903 --> 44:01.487
Uh, uhh-- uhh--

44:01.570 --> 44:03.362
Yeah?

44:03.445 --> 44:05.861
You're looking good.
You're-- You look better.

44:07.612 --> 44:11.362
So, hey, Tom and I
are gonna move here, we think.

44:11.445 --> 44:14.278
More permanently.
Less time in D.C.

44:15.362 --> 44:17.028
Oh, and we're engaged.

44:17.111 --> 44:20.028
Um, he wanted to ask you.

44:23.695 --> 44:25.028
I love you.

44:28.986 --> 44:30.278
I love you too.

44:42.195 --> 44:43.986
Ohhh.

44:48.820 --> 44:51.820
I'm gonna...
go get Joan. OK?

44:52.903 --> 44:53.945
It's-- It's fine.

44:54.028 --> 44:57.320
I-- I'll be back.

44:59.403 --> 45:01.612
- Yeah. He--

45:01.695 --> 45:03.403
Ohh.

45:12.654 --> 45:13.986
Everything OK?

45:14.070 --> 45:16.320
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

45:16.403 --> 45:18.070
He's looking better.

45:18.153 --> 45:20.529
Morning isn't usually
a good time.

45:20.612 --> 45:22.945
You know, the morphine,
he gets confused.

45:23.028 --> 45:25.779
He doesn't like you all to
see him when he's not himself.

45:25.861 --> 45:28.278
Uh-huh. Yeah,
he wasn't himself.

45:28.362 --> 45:29.445
- Right.
- So...

45:29.529 --> 45:33.028
Shiv, I'm a private person.

45:33.111 --> 45:34.945
Not all of us
are born into good ease.

45:35.028 --> 45:36.278
OK.

45:36.362 --> 45:37.945
So if you want to know
anything about me,

45:38.028 --> 45:40.278
just ask me,
and I will tell you.

45:42.111 --> 45:44.153
Uh-huh.

45:44.237 --> 45:45.529
Hey, Siobhan,
how's Pop?

45:45.612 --> 45:48.195
Yeah. Yeah, no, he's good.

45:48.278 --> 45:50.403
- OK, bye.
- He's tired.

45:55.903 --> 45:58.403
Mr. Polk :
Good afternoon.

45:58.487 --> 46:01.111
Thanks for making time for us,
Mr. Polk.

46:01.195 --> 46:02.779
Not at all.

46:02.861 --> 46:04.986
We've been looking
at the terms we can offer,

46:05.070 --> 46:06.945
I think you've seen
what we've put together.

46:07.028 --> 46:08.986
I have. I have.

46:09.070 --> 46:11.070
It's a very brutal structure.

46:11.153 --> 46:12.820
Well, these are the terms

46:12.903 --> 46:15.028
we think we can offer
right now.

46:15.111 --> 46:17.111
I mean, I don't know,

46:17.195 --> 46:18.320
the margin you're making,

46:18.403 --> 46:20.237
you might even say you were...

46:20.320 --> 46:23.403
well, I mean,
"extortion" is an ugly word,

46:23.487 --> 46:27.320
but, you know, so is
"buzz saw castration."

46:27.403 --> 46:30.362
Look, I think we should
keep things professional,
don't you?

46:30.445 --> 46:31.861
Uh-huh. Sure. Sure.

46:31.945 --> 46:36.195
And professionally,
we're going to repay.

46:36.278 --> 46:38.362
- We're good.

46:38.445 --> 46:40.362
Everything's golden.
We don't need you.

46:40.445 --> 46:42.445
This can all stay private,
and I'll be looking elsewhere

46:42.529 --> 46:44.237
for a banking partner
as we go supersonic.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.362
Good-bye.

46:45.445 --> 46:47.153
- Mr. Roy--
- And fuck you.

46:55.820 --> 46:57.445
- No.

46:57.529 --> 47:00.153
It's super-good.
I'm thinking...

47:00.237 --> 47:02.654
tout le lapin...

47:02.737 --> 47:04.320
"all of the rabbit."

47:04.403 --> 47:06.861
- All of it.
- Well, that's my question,

47:06.945 --> 47:08.820
is when they say
"all of the rabbit,"

47:08.903 --> 47:11.529
do they mean, like,
all  of the rabbit?

47:11.612 --> 47:14.111
I mean, it can't be,
like, all of it.

47:16.487 --> 47:19.028
So, is this the Stewy money
we're celebrating?

47:19.111 --> 47:20.612
Because I saw the news.

47:20.695 --> 47:23.237
Well, I wouldn't say
that I'm the man,

47:23.320 --> 47:27.153
but if there were a man,
hypothetically,

47:27.237 --> 47:29.903
he might look a lot like me.

47:29.986 --> 47:33.570
Yeah, I solved the debt issue
with private equity money.

47:33.654 --> 47:36.986
- I'm very happy for you.
- Yeah. Well...

47:39.195 --> 47:41.403
...the thing is, all of that,

47:41.487 --> 47:43.779
it's made me
think about everything,

47:43.861 --> 47:47.529
and, um...well, you know,

47:47.612 --> 47:49.903
like, here's where I'm at.

47:52.945 --> 47:54.028
I love you.

47:55.861 --> 47:56.945
OK.

47:57.028 --> 47:59.820
Well, thank you. Noted.

48:01.529 --> 48:03.779
Come on.
- That's--

48:03.861 --> 48:05.403
- "And... I..."
- Uh, Ken.

48:05.487 --> 48:09.861
OK. Uh, I'm not sure
that I love you.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.654
Yeah, you do.

48:14.737 --> 48:16.612
Fuck you.

48:16.695 --> 48:19.695
Look, you want us
to live separately, right?

48:19.779 --> 48:22.570
We don't know why right now,
you say you do.

48:22.654 --> 48:24.654
Now, that makes me unhappy.

48:24.737 --> 48:26.445
On the other hand, you claim,

48:26.529 --> 48:28.320
and of course
I don't believe you,

48:28.403 --> 48:30.820
that us being together
will make you  unhappy.

48:30.903 --> 48:34.487
So one of us
is going to be unhappy.

48:34.570 --> 48:36.861
I just don't see
why it has to be me.

48:36.945 --> 48:40.861
Wow. I-I cannot argue
with that logic.

48:40.945 --> 48:43.320
No, it's, like,
impenetrable logic.

48:43.403 --> 48:44.820
It's the argument
of a psychopath.

48:44.903 --> 48:46.986
A psychopath who might,

48:47.070 --> 48:50.612
hypothetically, be the man.

48:50.695 --> 48:52.320
- Who loves you.
- Mm-hmm.

48:52.403 --> 48:54.070
Fuck you.

49:26.320 --> 49:27.695
Kendall:
We are not breaking up.

49:27.779 --> 49:29.986
Rava:
Yes. We are. I--

49:32.028 --> 49:36.195
- We are not breaking up.
- Yes, we are.

49:36.278 --> 49:38.445
- Kendall: Sorry.

49:40.028 --> 49:43.529
- We are not. Not.
- Yes, we are.

49:43.612 --> 49:46.654
- No!
- Yes! Yes!

49:48.861 --> 49:52.487
- We are not breaking up.
- We fucking are.

49:52.570 --> 49:53.861
Roman: Good mornin'.

49:53.945 --> 49:55.779
Brex:
So, did you want
to work out down here?

49:55.861 --> 49:58.487
Want me to take
my car to the park,
we can parkour it?

49:58.570 --> 50:00.737
Well, here's the thing, Brex.

50:00.820 --> 50:02.487
I can't do shit, really,

50:02.570 --> 50:05.111
because my back
has been fucked
since Monday.

50:05.195 --> 50:06.695
Fucked how?

50:06.779 --> 50:08.445
Well, I assume
you're insured?

50:08.529 --> 50:11.861
I mean, I do big,
big shit here,
every day,

50:11.945 --> 50:16.487
so losing even
a quarter of a percent
of my operating capacity,

50:16.570 --> 50:18.654
that has million dollar
implications.

50:18.737 --> 50:22.529
So I'm thinkin'
maybe a test case,

50:22.612 --> 50:26.445
I throw three or four dozen
white-shoe lawyers at you

50:26.529 --> 50:30.487
and see what it would be like
to actually physically
destroy someone.

50:30.570 --> 50:33.612
Dude, I don't know
what happened,

50:33.695 --> 50:35.445
but I'm sure I can fix it.

50:35.529 --> 50:36.861
Mm-hmm.

50:39.695 --> 50:41.779
Fuck you.

50:41.861 --> 50:43.403
Oh, fuck you, dude!

50:43.487 --> 50:45.028
Jeez, look at you.
Look at your face!

50:45.111 --> 50:46.070
You're a piece of shit.

50:46.153 --> 50:48.529
Yeah.

50:48.612 --> 50:51.654
But, uh, no,
I'm just sayin'

50:51.737 --> 50:54.487
you need to take this
more seriously.

50:54.570 --> 50:56.195
OK.

51:05.820 --> 51:06.737
OK.

51:08.529 --> 51:09.737
I have to go.

51:11.695 --> 51:13.487
Kendall:
What about Malaya,
can't she

51:13.570 --> 51:15.362
No. Iverson will freak out.

51:23.487 --> 51:25.820
- Hey, Rava.

51:25.903 --> 51:28.028
Why don't we just do it all?

51:29.737 --> 51:31.779
You know

51:31.861 --> 51:35.237
Uh... let's talk later?

51:38.111 --> 51:39.737
What does that mean?

51:41.070 --> 51:42.320
Hey.

51:45.737 --> 51:47.820
That was nice, right?

51:49.153 --> 51:52.570
- Nevertheless.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.111
Look, I, um...

51:58.945 --> 52:02.028
I-- I don't know.
I don't know.

52:02.111 --> 52:03.737
Maybe it's, um, um--

52:05.612 --> 52:08.362
Shit. It's like--
It's like you're moving on,

52:08.445 --> 52:11.237
and maybe that makes me feel OK
about moving on too.

52:11.320 --> 52:14.529
No. I'm not moving on. Rava.

52:14.612 --> 52:15.986
That's bullshit.

52:17.861 --> 52:19.403
I got a lawyer.

52:19.487 --> 52:21.570
He's nice.

52:21.654 --> 52:24.529
Let's just keep this all
really, really nice, OK?

52:41.737 --> 52:43.487
Marcia?
Everything all right?

52:43.570 --> 52:46.070
Marcia:
Kendall, you father
would like to see you.

53:06.320 --> 53:09.153
Man on TV:
...a dozen troops swarmed
the drugs farm from the air,

53:09.237 --> 53:11.403
descending from helicopters,
while another unit

53:11.487 --> 53:12.945
entered on foot.

53:13.028 --> 53:14.820
It's claimed
the drug trafficking ring

53:14.903 --> 53:17.028
had been in existence
for over three years...

53:17.111 --> 53:20.153
Hey. Look at you.

53:22.529 --> 53:24.820
Sitting up.

53:24.903 --> 53:27.028
Fuckin' watchin' the news.

53:39.195 --> 53:40.362
It's good to see you, Dad.

53:44.986 --> 53:47.070
Well...

53:47.153 --> 53:48.945
you understand
after you went down,

53:49.028 --> 53:51.111
the stock tanked.

53:51.195 --> 53:53.487
I mean, you should be flattered,
I guess.

53:55.403 --> 53:58.529
We had some
pretty shitty options.

54:00.403 --> 54:03.570
I mean, you took a gamble
on that loan.

54:05.153 --> 54:08.278
But I found us
a private equity solution.

54:08.362 --> 54:09.737
So...

54:12.070 --> 54:14.195
I tried consulting you,
but--

54:16.403 --> 54:17.779
People like the shape of this.

54:17.861 --> 54:21.028
Karolina says there's
positive analyst noise.

54:22.278 --> 54:24.654
We are at 36%,

54:24.737 --> 54:27.403
with effective control,

54:27.487 --> 54:30.529
plus a war chest
to make some moves.

54:30.612 --> 54:32.612
We're--
We're in good shape, Dad.

54:32.695 --> 54:35.028
You just keep
getting better.

54:35.111 --> 54:37.028
I got this.

54:37.111 --> 54:38.654
Fuginidiot.

54:38.737 --> 54:40.445
Dad?

54:43.403 --> 54:45.820
Hey, can I get you something?

54:47.487 --> 54:49.986
You...

54:50.070 --> 54:53.028
are...

54:53.111 --> 54:54.445
fuh...

54:58.612 --> 55:01.445
...fucking idiot.

56:17.695 --> 56:18.945
Hi.

56:19.028 --> 56:20.861
I think, uh...

58:12.403 --> 58:13.570
KENDALL ROY: Hey, Dad. I didn't
know you were coming in.

58:13.654 --> 58:14.986
I'm just making sure
you're not selling

58:15.070 --> 58:16.986
any more of the company
from under me.

58:17.861 --> 58:19.195
-Me.

58:20.445 --> 58:22.654
Phil told me where
some of the bodies were buried.

58:22.945 --> 58:25.070
Steer clear
of the whole death pit.

58:25.153 --> 58:26.320
There's a death pit?

58:27.362 --> 58:28.570
He says he's coming tonight.

58:28.654 --> 58:31.111
Well, that's a concern
with major investors on hand.

58:31.487 --> 58:32.861
I don't think I can do this.

58:32.945 --> 58:33.986
KENDALL: What if he freaks out?

58:34.070 --> 58:35.362
What if he falls asleep
in his soup?

58:35.445 --> 58:37.278
What if he starts shouting
racist comments?

58:37.362 --> 58:38.695
Just another
Saturday night, baby.

58:39.153 --> 58:40.070
I see you.

58:40.153 --> 58:41.986
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
