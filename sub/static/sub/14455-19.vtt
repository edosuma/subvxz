Narrator: Coming up,
why is Murr feeling blue?

00:15.033 --> 00:18.033
You're lucky I don't punch
your lights out, freak.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.700
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

00:19.700 --> 00:22.067
Narrator: What's got Sal
shaking things up?

00:24.567 --> 00:25.767
And which punished Joker

00:25.767 --> 00:27.500
will have the wind
knocked out of his sails

00:27.500 --> 00:28.900
in tonight's big punishment?

00:28.900 --> 00:31.133
[ Crowd chants
"walk the plank" ]

00:31.133 --> 00:33.967
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.067
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:36.733 --> 00:38.367
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:40.167 --> 00:42.933
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:42.933 --> 00:44.933
Joe: Larry!

00:49.233 --> 00:50.900
Joe: Today, we're at Spencer's
at the Willowbrook Mall

00:50.900 --> 00:52.333
playing one of
our favorite games,

00:52.333 --> 00:53.200
"Did I Deserve That?"

00:53.200 --> 00:54.567
While greeting customers,

00:54.567 --> 00:57.367
the guys are going to send in
an angry "person from our lives"

00:57.367 --> 00:58.900
to throw water in our faces.

00:58.900 --> 00:59.767
What did we do wrong?

00:59.767 --> 01:00.700
Once we're soaking wet,

01:00.700 --> 01:01.833
the guys are going to tell us

01:01.833 --> 01:03.100
and then
we have to defend it.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.067
If you can't get
the customer to agree

01:05.067 --> 01:06.967
that you didn't deserve it,
you lose.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.100
**

01:10.100 --> 01:13.067
Joe: You don't want to be
that close to that camera.
Really

01:13.067 --> 01:16.200
It's super-high definition.
Yeah, we can see
every cube and pore.

01:17.767 --> 01:18.800
Oh, here we go, here we go.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.433
How are you doing?
Hi, how are you?

01:20.433 --> 01:24.133
We're giving $15 off
if you answer six questions.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.267
Murr: Okay, send him in!

01:25.267 --> 01:27.233
Have you ever shopped
at Spencer's before?

01:27.233 --> 01:28.233
Yes.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.433
**

01:30.433 --> 01:31.600
How could
you do this to me?

01:36.167 --> 01:38.133
Look at her face!
Look at her face!

01:38.133 --> 01:40.100
"Sal, I monkeyed around
with his retirement plan."

01:42.200 --> 01:44.800
I'm -- I-I monkeyed around
with his retirement plans.

01:49.633 --> 01:51.067
"I invested
into Circuit City."

01:52.067 --> 01:53.900
You know wh--
You know what it probably --

01:53.900 --> 01:55.933
the thing that really
I pissed them off

01:55.933 --> 01:57.433
is that I did take one chunk

01:57.433 --> 02:00.200
and I invested heavy
in, uh, Circuit City.

02:01.933 --> 02:04.700
I don't know why
they're still selling
Circuit City stock.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.400
You think I deserve that?
Hmm, I mean...

02:09.400 --> 02:10.433
-Ah!
-Ah!

02:12.967 --> 02:14.200
We got him, we got him!

02:14.200 --> 02:16.233
Enjoy your $15 coupon.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.633
Hi, guys. How are you?

02:19.633 --> 02:20.800
-Here we go.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.867
We have a promotion --

02:21.867 --> 02:23.233
$15 coupon for
anything in the store.

02:23.233 --> 02:24.900
All you got to do
is answer six questions

02:24.900 --> 02:26.567
that are super vague.
-Okay.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.300
-Send him in.
-Here we go, here we go!

02:28.300 --> 02:30.600
Have you purchased
anything from Spencer's?

02:30.600 --> 02:32.867
You're lucky I don't punch
your lights out, freak.

02:32.867 --> 02:35.467
-Ohh!
-That's a Slurpee!

02:35.467 --> 02:38.600
Yo, that guy is badass.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.133
Joe: Look at his mouth!

02:40.133 --> 02:41.600
It looks like you're
a  blue Smurf.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.100
Just say,
"I whispered the illest

02:45.100 --> 02:46.633
in his wife's ear."

02:46.633 --> 02:49.567
I whispered the illest
in his wife's ear.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.700
He clearly
took offense to it.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.333
"I always be illing."

02:56.333 --> 02:58.067
I always be illing.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.633
And when I talk ,
it's the illest.

03:00.633 --> 03:02.833
"In my defense,
I didn't know that
it was his wife."

03:02.833 --> 03:05.167
In my defense,
I didn't know it was his wife.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.800
"But the problem was,
she told me,

03:06.800 --> 03:08.700
and I continued talking
the illest ."

03:08.700 --> 03:10.900
She told me
she's his wife,

03:10.900 --> 03:14.067
but then I continued talking
the illest of .

03:18.067 --> 03:19.267
You know, ill, like
"chill, dope,

03:19.267 --> 03:21.067
funky,
fresh kind of stuff."

03:21.067 --> 03:22.633
"Fragmatic."
You know,
it was fragmatic.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.400
"Like the stuff I'm dropping
on you right now."

03:24.400 --> 03:27.467
Like the stuff I'm dropping
on you right now, ladies.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.533
Sal: They are silent!

03:29.533 --> 03:30.633
Can I ask you guys
a question?

03:30.633 --> 03:32.733
Did I deserve that?

03:32.733 --> 03:34.067
No.
No?

03:34.067 --> 03:35.133
-Aw.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.333
Let me tell you,

03:36.333 --> 03:38.067
he didn't look like
a Slurpee guy.

03:41.733 --> 03:43.500
Joey, what the
happened, man,

03:43.500 --> 03:44.967
to the sculpture I gave you?

03:44.967 --> 03:46.733
It's in my basement in a box.

03:46.733 --> 03:49.633
Why? You got the yard.
It's a pissing angel.

03:49.633 --> 03:50.733
Yeah, I know.

03:50.733 --> 03:51.867
That's --
I don't know what part of that

03:51.867 --> 03:53.167
you don't understand
why it's in my basement.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.733
We're doing a thing here
where we're doing, like,

03:57.733 --> 03:58.633
a two-minute survey.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.167
You get a $15 coup--
up at front.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.067
Nothing personal information.
Let's do it, right?

04:02.067 --> 04:03.433
Let's send her in.

04:03.433 --> 04:05.167
Is there anything
else bringing you in
here besides shirts?

04:05.167 --> 04:07.833
Joe, who's that?

04:07.833 --> 04:10.267
You are
a subversive creep!

04:10.267 --> 04:14.300
**

04:17.333 --> 04:19.500
Bitches be crazy as hell.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.800
"She has a weird sculpture
in her bathroom

04:21.800 --> 04:24.200
that I thought
was some kind of fancy toilet."

04:24.200 --> 04:26.733
She got some sort
of fancy sculpture
in her bathroom

04:26.733 --> 04:28.133
that I thought
was a toilet.

04:28.133 --> 04:29.067
Of what?

04:29.067 --> 04:30.833
It's a little kid pissing.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.933
So you thought you would
take a deuce on that?

04:33.933 --> 04:36.067
She had this party,
and I went to the bathroom.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.633
There's a little kid peeing --
like peeing in the fountain.

04:38.633 --> 04:39.767
There's no toilet.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.333
There's no toilet
in the bathroom,

04:41.333 --> 04:43.733
so that -- I was like,
that must be the toilet.

04:43.733 --> 04:45.567
It ended up
being a walk-in closet.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.567
"Listen, when I got to deuce,
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it."

04:49.567 --> 04:50.600
When I got to deuce,

04:50.600 --> 04:51.800
I'm 'bout it,
'bout it, all right?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.433
There's a bowl
and there's water running,

04:53.433 --> 04:54.400
I got to do it.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.900
To come in here
to my place of business,

04:57.900 --> 04:59.567
did I deserve that?

04:59.567 --> 05:01.233
Ah, no, yeah, you definitely
don't deserve that.

05:01.233 --> 05:02.467
-No.
-No, absolutely not.

05:02.467 --> 05:04.167
-Oh!
-No.

05:04.167 --> 05:05.867
I got to hit the bathroom.
I hope it's a real bathroom.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.433
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.833
Joe: Here you go, Q.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.167
I don't know
if you're buying anything,

05:13.167 --> 05:15.400
but we're just doing
customer questionnaires.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.700
Like the first question is

05:16.700 --> 05:17.933
have you ever shopped
at Spencer's before?
Yes.

05:17.933 --> 05:19.800
Oh, there you go.
Here you go, Q.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.400
Sal: Here she comes!

05:21.400 --> 05:23.967
Are you shopping for yourself
or for someone else?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.067
How could you?

05:27.067 --> 05:28.200
Piece of .

05:32.633 --> 05:34.700
She's upset
because, uh...

05:34.700 --> 05:36.400
"Doesn't she seem like
the kind of person

05:36.400 --> 05:38.267
who would enjoy
an old"

05:38.267 --> 05:40.067
You would think...

05:46.300 --> 05:49.733
Are you shopping for yourself
or for someone else?

05:49.733 --> 05:51.467
How could you?

05:51.467 --> 05:52.967
Piece of .

05:55.600 --> 05:57.633
She's upset because, uh...

05:57.633 --> 05:59.333
"Doesn't she seem like
the kind of person

05:59.333 --> 06:01.267
who would enjoy
an old"

06:01.267 --> 06:04.300
You would think...

06:04.300 --> 06:05.967
Doesn't she seem like
the type of person

06:05.967 --> 06:07.833
that would enjoy
an old

06:07.833 --> 06:09.500
"She's not."
She's not.

06:13.367 --> 06:14.200
Spell it out.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.500
Yeah.
So, just to clarify,

06:15.500 --> 06:16.533
what happened is I made

06:16.533 --> 06:17.967
a good old-fashioned
racist joke,

06:17.967 --> 06:19.533
I thought she would enjoy it.
She did not enjoy it.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.700
Obviously.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.067
Her response to it
is to come in here

06:23.067 --> 06:24.200
and then call me
a piece of trash

06:24.200 --> 06:25.300
and to throw water
in my face.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.433
Do you think
I deserve that?

06:26.433 --> 06:28.267
No.
No, right?

06:28.267 --> 06:30.067
-Ohh.
-All right.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.167
Thank you so much.
You know?

06:32.167 --> 06:33.533
You want to hear a joke?

06:34.800 --> 06:37.067
Narrator:
Sal got what he deserved,

06:37.067 --> 06:39.533
making him first up
on the loser board.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.067
Today, we are at Focus Plus,

06:42.067 --> 06:43.500
sitting with
a bunch of strangers

06:43.500 --> 06:45.200
waiting to be called
into a focus group.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.233
But here's the catch --

06:46.233 --> 06:47.600
all four of us
will be in the room

06:47.600 --> 06:48.733
at the same exact time.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.767
The goal is simple --
make the other guys laugh.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.633
If you laugh, you have
to leave the waiting room,

06:52.633 --> 06:54.767
and whoever gets through
without laughing wins.

06:54.767 --> 06:55.867
It's last man standing!

06:55.867 --> 06:57.567
While we're sitting
in a waiting room.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.833

08:02.067 --> 08:03.767
Oh, sorry.

08:03.767 --> 08:05.633
Oh, dude.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.600
How's my breath

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
Oh, yeah.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.467
**

08:19.267 --> 08:21.600
A Shake Weight?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.467
I ain't seen one of them
in a long time.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.267
They started selling them again.
They're back.

08:25.267 --> 08:27.167
They actually make a bigger one,
too, so it's...

08:27.167 --> 08:32.500
**

08:32.500 --> 08:33.900
I just do it
when I'm in my waiting rooms.

08:33.900 --> 08:34.933
It's how I get the toned.

08:34.933 --> 08:42.067
**

08:42.067 --> 08:43.900
That's all it takes --
three minutes a day.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.933
It's good to have
a regimen, though.
Woman: Yeah.

08:45.933 --> 08:55.933

08:55.933 --> 08:59.467

Woman: Oh, my God.

09:01.667 --> 09:05.367
**

09:05.367 --> 09:06.467
It's yogurt.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.367
It's an odd choice
to eat out of your fly.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.333
I'll save it for later.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.267

09:16.100 --> 09:18.067
Oh.

09:18.067 --> 09:19.133

09:39.900 --> 09:41.567

Woman: Okay.

09:51.933 --> 09:54.067
The hell did I lose again?

09:54.067 --> 09:55.933
Do one minute
every three days, yeah,

09:55.933 --> 09:57.800
and that's how I keep
this physique.

it's okay.

It's okay.

10:19.933 --> 10:22.867
Q: Sal, you're gonna make
yourself laugh, you stupid ass!

10:24.133 --> 10:26.800
You made yourself laugh,
you moron!

10:30.533 --> 10:32.300
I kamikazed it.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.667
**

10:33.667 --> 10:35.400
Oh, man,
that was unbelievable.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.200
I got myself...

10:38.200 --> 10:39.333
I couldn't take it.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.967
The kid started crying.

10:40.967 --> 10:42.400
And now he has to go
the rest of term

10:42.400 --> 10:43.800
with a child on his lap?

10:43.800 --> 10:46.033
His next thing,
he has to do with the kid.

10:46.033 --> 10:49.500
Q: Look at those nipples.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.533
Sal: Look at Joe's face --
Joe's face.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.833
Is that amusement?
Is it disgust?

10:55.833 --> 10:57.200
Is it bewilderment?
What is that?

11:00.467 --> 11:02.067
-Ohp.
-Oh, no.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.067
Please, God, no.

11:03.067 --> 11:04.833
**

11:07.400 --> 11:08.433
**

11:08.433 --> 11:09.700
Where the
are you going?

11:11.133 --> 11:16.133
**

11:23.900 --> 11:26.133
I eat a half an apple
every four days.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.633
Q: Now Murray's going,
Murray's going.

11:30.633 --> 11:33.767
**

11:33.767 --> 11:35.833
Sal: What is going on?
Oh, my God.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.633
Oh, my...
Nice bag.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.133
**

11:43.133 --> 11:44.567
Q: What's this?

11:44.567 --> 11:50.200
**

11:50.200 --> 11:53.300
-Ohh.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.700
-It's okay.
-Oh, my God.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.467
Sal:
It's...what is going on?

11:57.467 --> 11:58.367
Q: Oh, my God.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.067
Oh, my --
His bag.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.300
He's just --

12:01.300 --> 12:02.367
You both didn't know

12:02.367 --> 12:03.833
that you were
bringing children?
No.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.433
Come here, let's say hi.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.833
There you go.

12:06.833 --> 12:07.933
There was a child left

12:07.933 --> 12:09.100
outside of the room
in a sack

12:09.100 --> 12:10.400
He pulled it
into the room.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.600
Nobody's saying anything.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.400
Out of everything
we've done,

12:14.400 --> 12:17.133
this is the time
that no one says anything.

12:17.133 --> 12:18.433
Look at that snapshot.

12:21.633 --> 12:22.967
Your nipple's on him.

12:23.967 --> 12:26.400
Joey, oh.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.067
Wow.

12:28.067 --> 12:29.133
Good luck to you.

12:29.133 --> 12:30.833
You're cute, buddy.
I'll see you later.

12:32.900 --> 12:36.133
Narrator: This was no
laughing matter for Murr,

12:36.133 --> 12:38.633
so he's safe
from the loser board.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.367
Today, Q and Murr
are taking turns

12:40.367 --> 12:42.600
recording strangers'
conversations in the park.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.500
When a person asks them
why they're recording them,

12:44.500 --> 12:46.067
they'll need to give them
an explanation

12:46.067 --> 12:47.733
that's been given to them
by the other guys.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.367
If they don't allow
Murr or I

12:49.367 --> 12:51.867
to continue recording
their conversation, we lose.

12:51.867 --> 12:56.067
Guys, are we being
recorded right now?

12:57.933 --> 12:59.433
Was that over the top?

13:00.367 --> 13:03.767
**

13:03.767 --> 13:06.467
Sal: Q, I made you
a little listening device.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.100
Joe: It's a homemade
boom pole.
Yeah.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.800
I call that
the Conspicuous 5000.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.167
All right, so now I'm just
gonna go listen to people talk.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.300
Yeah,
you just got to sneak in.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.500
When they ask you,
we'll give you the reason.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.400
**

13:21.833 --> 13:25.067
Like -- she literally --
to her, that was like --

13:25.067 --> 13:26.367
Just keep talking naturally.
Don't worry about it.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.200
"I'm just doing a podcast
on urban dating."

13:29.200 --> 13:32.600
I'm doing a podcast on urban --
urban dating.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.600
We're not really on a date,
like, in that way.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.667
"I'll use it
for my other podcast."

13:39.667 --> 13:41.300
I'll use this
for my other podcast.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.800
"White Chicks
Talking ."

13:42.800 --> 13:45.367
"White Chicks
Talking ."

13:48.233 --> 13:50.100
So, would you mind if I just
keep recording you?

13:50.100 --> 13:52.067
You can keep recording,
I guess.
Oh! Cool.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.833
Thanks, guys.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.467
My audience is really
gonna love this.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.933
Here we go.

14:00.933 --> 14:02.867
This is so stupid.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.533
**

14:04.533 --> 14:06.467
Joe: Here we go.
Here we go.

14:06.467 --> 14:09.767
**

14:09.767 --> 14:11.267
Oh, you guys
went to Natural History.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.100
Very nice, very nice.

14:15.133 --> 14:18.367
Hey. Yeah, no, I'm just
recording your audio.

14:18.367 --> 14:21.067
Q: "I just need to record
some really dull nonsense

14:21.067 --> 14:24.067
for the background of a movie
I'm working on."

14:24.067 --> 14:26.067
Because I rea--
I need to record

14:26.067 --> 14:28.733
some really dull nonsense
for a movie I'm editing.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.600
So I just need, like, just
really dull nonsense.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.533
All right.
So you guys just --
just be yourself.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.133
Is it good
if I keep recording you?

14:39.133 --> 14:40.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, great.

14:42.233 --> 14:44.633
I hit the dull nonsense
jackpot.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.867
Narrator: Let the record show

14:47.867 --> 14:51.067
that Sal
is tonight's big loser.

14:51.067 --> 14:53.200
Ahoy, mateys!

14:53.200 --> 14:55.067
We're here
for Sal's big punishment.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.967
Today, you're gonna be
the captain of a pirate ship

14:56.967 --> 14:59.300
for a children's party
here at Jersey Shore
Pirate Adventures.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.500
A children's party.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.833
Yeah, a children's party.
Okay.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.233
Oh, if you're not sure
what to say, bud, don't worry --

15:03.233 --> 15:04.833
I'll be right there
in the boat with you.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.400
You got your first mate
right here.

15:07.433 --> 15:08.633
Is it a dull punishment?

15:08.633 --> 15:10.133
-No.
-He's gonna have fun.

15:10.133 --> 15:11.767
You're gonna be invited.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.467
Joe: Here we are.
Ahoy, kiddies!

15:13.467 --> 15:15.067
Q:
Look at the body language.

15:15.067 --> 15:17.467
Murray's so happy to do this,
Sal's just moping up.

15:18.967 --> 15:20.933
**

15:20.933 --> 15:22.067
Murr: Ahoy, kiddies!

15:22.067 --> 15:23.100
I'm here to introduce you

15:23.100 --> 15:25.100
to the captain
of this here ship,

15:25.100 --> 15:27.067
Flatfoot the Pirate!

15:27.067 --> 15:30.600
He's got the flatest feet
on the seven seas, arrr!

15:32.433 --> 15:34.433
It's a medical condition.

15:36.267 --> 15:39.800
We have the treasure here
from our last expedition.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.067
If you want to see,
let me hear you say, "Arrr!"

15:43.067 --> 15:43.867
All: Arrr!

15:43.867 --> 15:46.733
We've got a lollipop.

15:46.733 --> 15:49.367
Now, what's the best part
of a lollipop?

15:49.367 --> 15:50.933
-Eat it!
-Licking it!

15:50.933 --> 15:52.933
So, here's what
we're going to do.
Nope. Nope.

15:55.267 --> 15:58.200
Flatfoot the Pirate
sees where this is going.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.067
I want all of you
to take a lick

16:00.067 --> 16:01.200
from a different spot.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.533
-Me! Me!
-Okay.

16:02.533 --> 16:03.800
Take one lick,
one side.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.333
You lick another part.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.700
Murr: There you go!
There's plenty of
spots still open!

16:08.700 --> 16:10.067
Lick that part
right there.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.167
-I want another one!
-Hey, hey.

16:11.167 --> 16:14.467
Oh, God, that's...
Yeah!

16:14.467 --> 16:18.100
Now, who gets the last lick
of the lollipop?

16:18.100 --> 16:20.600
All: The captain!
The captain,
that's right!

16:20.600 --> 16:23.433
No, it's actually the,
uh, youngest child.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.500
Oh...
No.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.833
Go ahead, Flatfoot!
Oh, God.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.167
You earned it!

16:29.167 --> 16:31.067
Do it, do it!

16:34.067 --> 16:35.100
Lick it!

16:35.100 --> 16:37.100
Ohh!

16:37.100 --> 16:38.133
Good work, buddy.

16:38.133 --> 16:40.200
All: Yeah!

16:40.200 --> 16:43.100
Murr: Yes, very good.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.333
Oh, I know it is,
it's all over you --

16:45.333 --> 16:46.600
but that was the idea.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.200
**

16:48.200 --> 16:50.400
Now, kiddies,
what's the best part

16:50.400 --> 16:51.600
of being a pirate?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.467
Go on the seven seas!

16:53.467 --> 16:55.100
Yes,
we sail the seven seas.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.767
And when
we sail the seven seas,

16:56.767 --> 16:59.067
we drink and we sing
all day long.

16:59.067 --> 17:02.133
Let's hand out some rum
for the whole crew!

17:02.133 --> 17:04.633
Oh, rummy-rum-rum.
My favorite.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.067
Joe: These kids
all have their drinks,

17:06.067 --> 17:07.800
but don't worry,
the captain has a special drink.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.067
Murr: Now don't drink yet

17:09.067 --> 17:10.533
because our captain's
got to sing us a song.

17:10.533 --> 17:12.300
Here we go!

17:12.300 --> 17:16.067
* Raise a mug
and admire it *

17:16.067 --> 17:18.933
* Let's toast
to Flatfoot the Pirate *

17:18.933 --> 17:20.400
Q: Oh, my God.
Joe: Good. There you go.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.733
* I've sailed
across the seven seas *

17:23.733 --> 17:27.333
* And drank
with maiden and mateys *

17:27.333 --> 17:30.433
* The finest milk
you have right now *

17:30.433 --> 17:34.300
* Comes directly
from the cow *

17:34.300 --> 17:38.233
* But Flatfoot's milk,
it is the best *

17:38.233 --> 17:39.567
* Be-- hey

17:43.767 --> 17:45.367
Oh...
You had it, Flatfoot!

17:45.367 --> 17:46.733
Oh...

17:46.733 --> 17:51.100
* Because it comes
from a woman's breast *

17:51.100 --> 17:52.200
Cheers.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.100
Oh, ho, ho, ho, boy.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.767
Raise them up, pirates!

17:56.767 --> 17:58.467
There you go, Flatfoot!

17:58.467 --> 18:00.700
**

18:05.167 --> 18:07.467
* Flatfoot's milk,
it is the best *

18:08.400 --> 18:12.633
* Because it comes
from a woman's breast *

18:12.633 --> 18:13.600
Cheers.

18:15.367 --> 18:16.500
Oh, ho, ho, ho, boy.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.567
Raise them up, pirates!

18:17.567 --> 18:20.767
There you go, Flatfoot!

18:23.500 --> 18:26.267
Arrr...on three!

18:26.267 --> 18:28.133
One, two, three!

18:28.133 --> 18:29.767
All: Arrr!

18:33.067 --> 18:34.067
Drink.

18:35.067 --> 18:37.867
**

18:41.200 --> 18:43.367
Oh, my God.

18:43.367 --> 18:45.433
Girl: What is it?

18:49.067 --> 18:52.067
Forgive us a moment
while Flatfoot throws up.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.067
I think his rum
wasn't pasteurized.

18:56.767 --> 18:59.500
Joe:
Sal, don't worry, buddy.
You're not in this alone.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.367
Murr -- cheers, matey.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.767
What does that mean,
"Cheers"?

19:04.767 --> 19:07.067
-Waaaah!
-Waaaah!

19:07.067 --> 19:08.067
You're fu--

19:09.300 --> 19:11.133
Joe: We just
checked the scoreboard.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.233
Murray lost, too.

19:12.233 --> 19:13.400
I did not.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.900
Drink up, my mate!

19:14.900 --> 19:17.067
I saved some for you!

19:19.100 --> 19:20.500
Ah, come on.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.067
Murray didn't really lose.
He didn't lose.

19:22.067 --> 19:24.133
We're just messing with him!
We're just messing with him!

19:24.133 --> 19:25.433
This is amazing
if he drinks it!

19:27.067 --> 19:29.300
Look at him go.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.700
All right!

19:30.700 --> 19:33.067
-Chug!
-Chug!

19:33.067 --> 19:34.933
Oh, ho, ho, my God.

19:37.933 --> 19:39.300
Oh,
that was delicious!

19:39.300 --> 19:40.600
Joe: Hey, Murr?
Yeah.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.533
We were just kidding,
buddy.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.267
I got to be honest,

19:46.267 --> 19:48.500
after all my years
on the ship,

19:48.500 --> 19:50.467
that was a low blow.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.133
Q: We now return you

19:52.133 --> 19:54.667
to your regularly scheduled
punishment of Sal.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.467
Murr: All right, now,

19:57.467 --> 19:59.333
you know what
every good crew needs to do

19:59.333 --> 20:00.867
to a captain on a ship.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.867
They need to mount a mutiny.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.767
Who wants
to overthrow the captain

20:04.767 --> 20:06.200
and take over the ship?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.767
Sal: I don't like
the sound of it.

20:07.767 --> 20:09.633
Now what we need
are swords.

20:09.633 --> 20:12.200
Everyone take a sword.
Now you need to respect --

20:12.200 --> 20:14.100
There's plenty
to go around!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.367
Let's drive this captain
off this boat.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.400
Get him!

20:19.400 --> 20:20.700
-Look out...!
-Walk the plank!

20:20.700 --> 20:25.533
[ All chanting
"walk the plank" ]

20:25.533 --> 20:27.433
Ow, that hurts.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.500
You're hitting me
in the .

20:30.833 --> 20:34.933
[ All chanting
"walk the plank" ]

20:34.933 --> 20:36.700
Q:
The clean waters of Jersey!

20:39.833 --> 20:41.333
Now, tell us --
is there anything

20:41.333 --> 20:43.267
you want to say to the crew
before you depart?

20:43.267 --> 20:45.467
First of all...
Yes.

20:45.467 --> 20:46.467
Oh!

20:49.700 --> 20:51.567
No last words!

20:51.567 --> 20:53.400
We did it, crew!
We did it!

20:54.867 --> 20:56.067
Shut up!

20:58.167 --> 21:00.733
Oh, that water
is not clean, buddy.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.067
This is disgusting!

21:03.067 --> 21:05.400
What about parasites?

21:11.433 --> 21:13.067
Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

21:13.067 --> 21:14.167
Sal just walked the plank,

21:14.167 --> 21:15.933
but there's a shipload
of bonus footage

21:15.933 --> 21:17.400
that you get to see
right now.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.067
Drink up.

21:19.067 --> 21:20.200
Joe: Well, we have
a treasure chest,

21:20.200 --> 21:21.900
and this is gonna be
the treasure.
Okay.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.167
So we can be like,

21:23.167 --> 21:25.067
"Now our reward
is this a lolly."

21:25.067 --> 21:27.433
"We brought this arrr-tificially
flavored candy."

21:28.900 --> 21:30.633
Casey: I think this
came out of a conversation

21:30.633 --> 21:31.933
where Sal had mentioned

21:31.933 --> 21:33.300
that he would never
drink breast milk.
Yes.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.367
Like -- and that's a thing
with "Impractical Jokers" --

21:35.367 --> 21:37.933
if you say something
you would never do,

21:37.933 --> 21:39.967
it's gonna be
a punishment.
Yeah, I mean, that's --

21:39.967 --> 21:41.600
these guys made a mistake
a long time ago

21:41.600 --> 21:43.167
by just being
way too honest.

21:43.167 --> 21:46.133
I always forget about
the stupid hair!

21:46.133 --> 21:48.333
I did,
I totally forgot about it.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.167
Joe: Oh, my God, he's gonna be
a pirate with that!

21:51.700 --> 21:53.200
Turn on the tsunami!

21:53.200 --> 21:56.100
Murray's hat won't stay on
because of your hair.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.800
My hairrrr.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.133
Expect a lot of that
on the boat.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.300
A lot of pirate puns
coming your way.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.767
Oh, God, come on.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.133
Pirate pun-ishment.

22:04.133 --> 22:06.800
Oh, God. Oh..

22:06.800 --> 22:08.667
Oh, shoot.

22:09.933 --> 22:12.400
Captain, tell us a story
of the storm!
Okay.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.733
Once upon a time,

22:14.733 --> 22:19.633
there was a pirate ship
named the Jolly Roger.

22:19.633 --> 22:23.067
One time,
I was taking the Jolly Roger

22:23.067 --> 22:24.367
over to the mall...

22:26.100 --> 22:27.500
...a couple of
snot-nosed punks

22:27.500 --> 22:30.067
in a newer, faster
Jolly Roger

22:30.067 --> 22:32.167
who think they own the sea

22:32.167 --> 22:33.567
cut me off.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.633
This is the story of
when the kid clipped his car.

22:39.633 --> 22:43.900
The Jolly Roger --
was a '99 brand-new --

22:43.900 --> 22:47.300
I had made
but one payment

22:47.300 --> 22:50.300
before the fender
of the Jolly Roger

22:50.300 --> 22:52.433
was good and scratched up.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.800
It's been 15 years.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.500
He still can't
let this thing go.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.867
Murr: We did it!

22:59.200 --> 23:00.900
I want to get out.

23:02.233 --> 23:04.500
I spit up so much phlegm
into that bucket

23:04.500 --> 23:06.200
after I drank
that tit milk.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.533
But do you
like tit milk now?

23:08.533 --> 23:11.633
What do you think?
No, it tastes like
soy vanilla.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.767
So, this was not
your punishment.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.200
No. They tricked me.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.400
-Waaaah.
-Waaaah.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.533
In my head, I'm, like --

23:18.533 --> 23:19.567
I'm trying to do the math
from the episode.

23:19.567 --> 23:20.633
I'm, like,
did I actually lose?

23:20.633 --> 23:21.700
I felt bad for you,

23:21.700 --> 23:23.067
and I was, like,
you have to do something

23:23.067 --> 23:23.933
to get them back.
Yeah.

23:23.933 --> 23:25.133
Were you actually,
like, annoyed

23:25.133 --> 23:26.267
by the little
plastic swords?

23:26.267 --> 23:28.600
Oh, first of all...

23:28.600 --> 23:31.167
they were taking
swipes at my calves.

23:31.167 --> 23:32.467
[ All chanting
"walk the plank" ]

23:32.467 --> 23:33.900
Ow -- ow, that hurts!

23:33.900 --> 23:35.267
Those were
sharp, heavy plastic.

23:35.267 --> 23:36.667
Those kids
were taking full swipes

23:36.667 --> 23:38.067
all about my ankles.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.867
Oh, man, you're going to have
black-and-blues forever.

23:39.867 --> 23:40.933
Ahh!

23:42.667 --> 23:44.867
I was literally stalling
so that that could happen.
I'm done.

23:46.867 --> 23:47.933
Murr: So here we go.

23:47.933 --> 23:49.567
Are you shopping
for anything specific

23:49.567 --> 23:50.633
or are you just browsing?

23:50.633 --> 23:51.633
Hey.

23:51.633 --> 23:52.867
He-- oh, no.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.867
Been waiting four years
to do that.

24:02.533 --> 24:05.867
That's Simmy Kustanowitz,
our network executive.

24:05.867 --> 24:07.100
"I disagreed with his notes."

24:08.567 --> 24:11.233
I disagreed
with his notes.

24:11.233 --> 24:13.333
He didn't like a joke
I made.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.433
I liked the joke.

24:14.433 --> 24:16.600
The notes he gave were,
I thought, outrageous,

24:16.600 --> 24:17.833
but, uh...you know,

24:17.833 --> 24:19.800
the guy dressed like a sausage
in a commercial once

24:19.800 --> 24:21.933
and I'm the jerk standing here
with water all over him.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.233
He literally played
a sausage in a commercial.

24:26.233 --> 24:27.600
Now he's giving me
notes on comedy.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.733
I don't deserve that,
right?

24:30.067 --> 24:31.067
No.
No.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.633
-All right.

24:32.633 --> 24:34.433
Joe: But Simmy still
got to throw the water,

24:34.433 --> 24:35.867
so it feels like a loss.

24:35.867 --> 24:37.433
Simmy still got it,
yeah.
