WEBVTT

00:06.202 --> 00:08.067
This is
Slammin' Sammy Meade, folks,

00:08.137 --> 00:11.265
and Panther football
is just five days away,

00:11.340 --> 00:13.934
and you know what that means.
Time to start talking.

00:14.210 --> 00:18.670
Coach Eric Taylor, misunderstood
genius or one-hit wonder?

00:18.748 --> 00:21.342
John from Seven Lakes, you're on.
Come on, what do you got?

00:21.417 --> 00:24.546
I tell you, Sammy, I was all
for bringing Taylor back from TMU

00:24.621 --> 00:26.213
even though he abandoned us.
Yeah.

00:26.289 --> 00:27.586
But we all saw what happened,

00:27.657 --> 00:29.284
which was, Smash
Williams got injured.

00:29.359 --> 00:32.089
And the guy had
no backup plan. Zero.

00:32.162 --> 00:35.563
I honestly don't see what a more
practical car is than a 2002 Celica.

00:35.632 --> 00:36.690
The
sprinkler's on!

00:36.767 --> 00:37.825
It's not about the Celica.

00:37.934 --> 00:38.992
I know it's a practical car.

00:39.069 --> 00:41.902
It's about the fact that I can't
have you changing your classes.

00:41.972 --> 00:44.463
You need to be in Dr. Wells'
English class. Period.

00:44.541 --> 00:46.668
Mom, I only put
12,000 miles on the car.

00:46.743 --> 00:49.678
And they were all to church, so
technically they're all Christian miles.

00:49.746 --> 00:51.236
I don't really care what
kind of miles they are.

00:51.314 --> 00:53.043
You act as though
I'm dropping out of school.

00:53.116 --> 00:55.914
She's not listening to me.
I just want to get a job.

00:55.986 --> 00:58.386
I'm taking the same amount
of classes in fewer hours.

00:58.455 --> 01:00.014
I'm just making my time
more efficient.

01:00.091 --> 01:03.686
It's not efficient for you to take a
class with a teacher who is inferior.

01:03.761 --> 01:06.525
You know what? It'd be really nice if
people didn't throw their trash in my car.

01:06.597 --> 01:07.655
'Cause this is my car.

01:07.732 --> 01:10.166
And second of all, Principal
Taylor, you look hot.

01:10.234 --> 01:12.134
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.

01:12.203 --> 01:13.727
I've got little
butterflies in my stomach.

01:16.841 --> 01:18.308
Coach Taylor!

01:18.643 --> 01:20.201
Coach Taylor,
the problem remains,

01:20.278 --> 01:23.611
your team imploded in last year's playoffs
when Smash Williams hurt his knee.

01:26.317 --> 01:27.944
Again, if we couldn't
win without him then,

01:28.019 --> 01:29.953
how can we win
now that he's graduated?

01:30.021 --> 01:32.080
The team's got a lot of spirit.
Team's doing just fine.

01:32.156 --> 01:33.453
Very solid, very solid.

01:33.691 --> 01:35.922
Go, go, go, go!
Go! Get your ass up!

01:38.263 --> 01:39.252
Hut!

01:43.102 --> 01:46.401
You have Tim Riggins stepping into Smash
Williams' crucial role at tailback.

01:46.472 --> 01:48.599
What if he decides to take off
to Mexico like he did last year?

01:48.674 --> 01:50.471
Yes, Tim Riggins,
is he focused?

01:54.279 --> 01:55.371
Yeah!

01:58.317 --> 02:00.751
One thing I can guarantee
about Tim Riggins

02:00.819 --> 02:03.720
is that he is focused on
football and only football.

02:03.789 --> 02:05.950
How are Riggins and Saracen?
How are they jelling?

02:09.061 --> 02:12.463
Just keep running for the ball.
I'm putting the ball where you got to be.

02:12.732 --> 02:13.858
Tim and Matt are like brothers.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.197
How about that new
quarterback from Dallas?

02:16.269 --> 02:18.237
You know, J.D. McCoy?
McCoy?

02:18.304 --> 02:20.602
There's rumors that he
may replace Saracen.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.166
Hey.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.305
Nice snag, come up.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.609
J.D. McCoy is
a freshman.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.515
Yeah, but he broke State records
when he was in middle school.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.280
And since you're in a rebuilding
year anyway, it makes...

02:34.354 --> 02:36.288
We're not in a rebuilding year.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.755
No, we're not in
a rebuilding year.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.758
So you're saying
Matt Saracen's your man?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.259
That is very much
what I'm saying.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.856
Matt Saracen, whether he's on
the field or off the field,

02:45.198 --> 02:47.724
whatever you throw at that
young man, he can handle.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.201
I can't get this knot out of my shoe, okay?
Can we just...

02:50.271 --> 02:51.738
Matt, forget about it.
You're not gonna do it.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.102
You've been working on it all summer.
Let's go.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.539
Take your time,
y'all! Seriously.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.475
Look, my point is that
this is your senior year,

02:57.811 --> 02:59.938
and after this, it's all just...
It's all just downhill.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.342
I mean, right, Tyra? Doesn't he need
to soak up every second of this?

03:04.418 --> 03:08.514
Look, this year is all about doing well
so I can get out of Dillon forever.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.114
That's all I care about.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.659
Baby, that's not the
point of what I'm...

03:12.726 --> 03:14.660
Don't call me that.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.218
What's going on
with y'all two now?

03:16.297 --> 03:17.355
We broke up.
Taking a break.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.666
We broke up.

03:19.733 --> 03:23.192
Three steps back, watch your shoulders.
Ear high. Left.

03:24.673 --> 03:27.005
Is that...
Is that J.D.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.403
Get your shoulder rotation...
Looks like the plot just thickened, man.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.309
Let's just go to the pep rally.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.599 --> 03:53.261
Don't even worry about
that two-game rumor deal.

03:55.237 --> 03:56.329
What two-game
rumor?

03:58.774 --> 04:00.742
I got it under control.

04:12.555 --> 04:14.546
I want to ask all of you

04:15.324 --> 04:16.985
only one question.

04:21.831 --> 04:23.128
You ready for Friday night?

04:31.040 --> 04:33.271
Here are your 2008
Dillon Panthers.

05:56.462 --> 05:58.521
Lyla, rise and shine, baby.

05:58.864 --> 06:01.059
I've made your favorite.
Pegs and eggs.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.260
And chocolate-chip
pancakes.

06:05.804 --> 06:06.793
Lyla.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.771
Dad, I'm not seven anymore.

06:09.842 --> 06:10.831
I know.
Okay.

06:10.909 --> 06:12.900
But I'm just so happy
you're here.

06:12.978 --> 06:14.809
It's first day of school
and you're a senior,

06:14.880 --> 06:17.314
and you can go to any college you
want to, and I'm proud of you,

06:17.383 --> 06:21.115
and you're here with me and not
with Mom in Northern California

06:21.187 --> 06:24.156
with some vegetarian,
raising figs. I'm just...

06:24.224 --> 06:25.714
It's a great day,
baby! Let's go!

06:25.792 --> 06:27.487
I'll be out in five.
All right.

06:36.669 --> 06:38.364
Is there enough pegs and eggs for me?
Shut up.

06:39.005 --> 06:41.735
I really need to get a
workout before breakfast.

06:41.808 --> 06:43.105
You know what?

06:43.443 --> 06:44.740
No! No! No!
What are you gonna do? Come on.

06:51.351 --> 06:52.716
Let's go!

07:07.134 --> 07:09.625
Well, hell, you cut off
two tenths of a second.

07:09.737 --> 07:11.034
Two tenths?
Two tenths.

07:11.105 --> 07:12.265
Let's call Sammy Meade.

07:12.339 --> 07:15.206
Tell him I'll be able to run in Buddy
Garrity's 5K charity race this year.

07:15.276 --> 07:17.210
Listen to me. You go see
that doctor tomorrow,

07:17.278 --> 07:19.143
tell him I want to start doing
some side-to-side on that knee.

07:19.213 --> 07:21.272
Find out what he has to say.
Understand? Coach.

07:21.882 --> 07:23.941
Why are you spending
all this time on me?

07:24.018 --> 07:26.851
I mean, I graduated,
I'm not your problem anymore.

07:29.723 --> 07:31.988
The reason I'm spending
all this time on you

07:32.461 --> 07:33.951
is because I wanna get you
on a team and into college

07:34.029 --> 07:37.396
so I don't have to see your ugly face
over at the Alamo Freeze anymore.

07:37.532 --> 07:39.557
You call me after
you see that doctor.

07:39.634 --> 07:41.192
Yes, sir.
All right.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.861
Don't forget to pick up
those cones!

07:49.644 --> 07:50.975
Good morning.

07:51.046 --> 07:53.014
Good to see y'all.
Yeah, here we go.

07:53.815 --> 07:56.511
Hey, Mrs. Taylor.
Hey, great to see you this year.

07:56.585 --> 07:58.644
Hey, Principal T.
Cute haircut!

07:58.720 --> 08:00.278
Hi, Tyra.
Congratulations.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.583
Thank you.
It's gonna be a great year.

08:01.656 --> 08:02.680
Good luck.
For you!

08:02.757 --> 08:04.247
You're gonna have a good day.
Thank you.

08:04.326 --> 08:05.918
Hi, honey, how...
Principal Taylor?

08:05.994 --> 08:08.122
Hello, Vice-Principal Trucks,
how are you this morning?

08:08.197 --> 08:10.097
Good morning.
The air conditioning system's down

08:10.166 --> 08:12.225
and we have 34 students
on Cortese Avenue

08:12.301 --> 08:14.462
that have been abandoned because
there was no room on the school bus.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.971
Oh, good Lord. All right, we need to
get those students taken care of...

08:17.039 --> 08:18.165
I've borrowed the team buses,

08:18.241 --> 08:20.709
I put a request into the district
for three additional buses.

08:20.776 --> 08:22.175
Hopefully, that will
get us one.

08:22.478 --> 08:24.503
Okay, all right, so they're gonna
be taken care of, those kids?

08:24.580 --> 08:26.480
Yes. All right, great.
What about the AC?

08:26.549 --> 08:28.676
We put a Band-Aid on it and
pray, like we always have.

08:28.751 --> 08:30.412
All right. Thank you.
Thank you for dealing with that.

08:30.486 --> 08:31.919
Don't forget the budget's
due by the end of the week.

08:31.988 --> 08:34.980
Yes. I'm collecting all the data for that.
Have a great day.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.349
Hi.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.126
That was good.

08:42.065 --> 08:43.657
Hey, how are you?

08:50.908 --> 08:52.375
Hey, Tim.
Hey.

08:52.442 --> 08:54.774
I guess I lost the lottery.
I'm your rally girl this year.

08:55.312 --> 08:56.336
Damn!

08:57.347 --> 09:00.077
Uh, Lyla, rally girl.
Hi.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.977
Hey, Lyla.
So are you two together?

09:03.720 --> 09:06.746
Um... No.

09:06.823 --> 09:09.121
No, we're just friends.
We're buddies. Good buddies.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.252
Strong friends. Yeah.
Good friends. Buddies.

09:12.362 --> 09:13.351
Okay.

09:14.565 --> 09:18.730
Anyway, Tim, anything you
need, anytime you want it.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.464
Well.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.941
Well, that's good, I think we've
spent enough time in school today.

09:26.010 --> 09:27.978
I say we go up to the roof
and see what happens.

09:28.046 --> 09:29.308
What about homeroom?

09:29.380 --> 09:30.938
What about homeroom?

09:54.239 --> 09:56.139
Go, go, go!

09:58.010 --> 10:00.808
Inside shoulder.
Inside shoulder.

10:03.549 --> 10:05.380
Set your feet, J.D.
Set your feet.

10:07.686 --> 10:10.120
All right, pick them up!
Pick them up! Knees up!

10:16.629 --> 10:18.494
McCoy is looking good, Coach.

10:18.697 --> 10:21.165
We'll see what happens
when the marbles drop.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.559
White, 9!

10:23.636 --> 10:25.604
White, 9! Hut!

10:26.772 --> 10:29.742
Matt, what the hell
are you doing? Get the ball!

10:29.809 --> 10:32.676
Come on, Matt, you got to
make it straight! Let's go!

10:32.812 --> 10:34.905
I'd love to see my boy
get some reps out there.

10:36.249 --> 10:37.443
Oh, yeah, that'll happen.

10:37.784 --> 10:39.945
Let's go! Get your head
in the game, let's go.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.011
Get on the ball!
Riggins!

10:42.622 --> 10:45.090
Who the hell is that
up there, talking to him?

10:45.725 --> 10:47.522
That's J.D. McCoy's
daddy.

10:47.594 --> 10:50.586
Big beer distributor.
Call him the Stud of Suds.

10:50.797 --> 10:52.594
Look at old Buddy
sucking up, up there.

10:52.666 --> 10:54.293
Hey, Buddy!

10:59.239 --> 11:00.365
Let's go, gentlemen!

11:00.974 --> 11:03.442
What schools were you
thinking of applying to?

11:03.510 --> 11:06.912
Oh, I was thinking
of U.T. Austin,

11:07.014 --> 11:10.142
TMU, Southern Methodist,
maybe A&M.

11:10.651 --> 11:11.640
I see.

11:11.719 --> 11:13.311
Tyra,

11:13.387 --> 11:16.015
you really think
that sounds realistic?

11:16.257 --> 11:19.488
Well... Okay, I know
A&M is a long shot, but...

11:19.927 --> 11:21.861
You have a 2.6 GPA.

11:22.463 --> 11:24.727
There is no way any of those
schools that you just mentioned

11:24.799 --> 11:26.630
are going to
seriously consider...

11:26.701 --> 11:28.464
But you got to look
at my progress.

11:28.536 --> 11:31.630
I mean, my grades from last
year have radically improved.

11:31.706 --> 11:36.609
I know, but your 1.
Freshman year still counts. It all counts.

11:36.811 --> 11:40.304
I just don't want you to waste your time...
Mrs. Taylor, she told me...

11:40.382 --> 11:43.317
Miss Collette, state
schools are a pipe dream.

11:44.319 --> 11:45.911
You need to start thinking
about other options.

11:45.987 --> 11:48.547
Technical colleges,
junior colleges.

11:49.191 --> 11:50.920
Like Dillon Tech?

11:51.426 --> 11:54.395
Don't look down on Dillon Tech.
It's a good option. It's...

11:54.496 --> 11:56.464
It's a realistic option.

11:59.935 --> 12:02.563
Whoa! Burning the
midnight oil, are you?

12:02.637 --> 12:04.229
Buddy, how you doing?

12:04.306 --> 12:06.467
T. Tami, what are you doing,
making some big power moves?

12:06.541 --> 12:08.441
Oh, yeah, it's
awfully glamorous.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.568
Right now, I'm trying to decide

12:09.644 --> 12:12.875
if we can afford chalk
or soap this year.

12:12.948 --> 12:14.540
Wish I was kidding.

12:14.616 --> 12:16.448
T. Tami, I'm here
to cheer you up.

12:16.519 --> 12:19.249
You always cheer me up.
I got just two words for you.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.222
What?
JumboTron.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.316
JumboTron?
Mmm-hmm.

12:24.393 --> 12:28.693
Have you ever seen two people
engaged on a JumboTron

12:28.765 --> 12:30.995
at a football game?
I mean, just think about it.

12:31.067 --> 12:34.264
Love and football are the two
greatest things in the world.

12:34.337 --> 12:38.171
You put the two together, put it
on a 30-foot Mitsubishi screen,

12:38.241 --> 12:40.106
and it's pure nirvana.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.005
That's a big check!
Yes, ma'am.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.710
Oh, my. We...

12:49.051 --> 12:52.920
We have lost four teachers
to budget cuts this year.

12:53.924 --> 12:56.256
We need a JumboTron, you think?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.422
Well, no, Tami,
we don't need one.

12:58.495 --> 12:59.962
But we want one.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.760
And we're gonna have one
because of that.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.063
And you're gonna get
all the credit.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.595
That's a lot of zeros right
there, is what that is.

13:08.672 --> 13:10.162
Yes, it is.

13:10.240 --> 13:14.040
You and I are gonna make a
beautiful team together, T. Tami.

13:28.793 --> 13:30.818
For six weeks, it's great.

13:31.196 --> 13:33.858
Great sex, great
everything, you know?

13:35.633 --> 13:39.569
Then we go to school, it's like a...
It's like a 180.

13:41.973 --> 13:44.806
Sounds to me, Tim,
like you got a problem.

13:44.876 --> 13:46.434
It's what it sounds like.

13:46.511 --> 13:49.947
Now, I told you from day one that Lyla
Garrity was never gonna take you seriously.

13:50.949 --> 13:54.350
One of these days, you're gonna
stop with all this screwing around

13:54.419 --> 13:56.910
and find you the love
of a good woman.

13:56.988 --> 13:58.717
Like I got with Mindy.

13:58.790 --> 14:02.022
Yeah, Billy, you got a real
fairy tale going on right now.

14:02.261 --> 14:04.092
That's a job, Tim.

14:04.763 --> 14:05.752
You think I give a crap

14:05.831 --> 14:10.234
that my girlfriend's giving some
50-year-old fatass trucker a lap dance?

14:10.536 --> 14:13.733
Hey! Hey, Mind!
I love you, baby!

14:13.806 --> 14:15.239
No, I'm lucky.
I love you.

14:15.307 --> 14:17.605
See? You see that, Tim?

14:17.676 --> 14:20.110
Hey, that's public.
Look at me.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.211
That's love.

14:22.281 --> 14:23.976
The whole Lyla thing, you...

14:24.049 --> 14:26.517
She went to bed with Jesus,

14:26.585 --> 14:28.280
and woke up with you.

14:28.354 --> 14:30.481
Jesus, you.

14:31.123 --> 14:32.556
You are a rebound from Jesus.

14:32.625 --> 14:33.819
No, I'm not a rebound.

14:33.893 --> 14:35.520
You're a summer fling, Tim.

14:36.662 --> 14:38.563
I don't believe that.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.861
The A.C.L. is
healing nicely.

14:42.903 --> 14:46.669
The muscles surrounding your knee are
getting stronger, which is great.

14:46.806 --> 14:50.139
Looks like you are on your
way to a full recovery.

14:50.577 --> 14:52.841
Got yourself a clean
bill of health, son.

14:52.913 --> 14:54.244
That's wonderful,
ain't that wonderful?

14:54.314 --> 14:56.782
He still gonna get that
scholarship, I know it. Mom.

14:56.850 --> 14:58.181
I'm just trying
to think positive...

14:58.251 --> 15:00.879
I lost the scholarship.
They gave it away.

15:00.954 --> 15:02.478
Well, they said for you
to contact them...

15:02.555 --> 15:06.150
The semester started.
Kickoff's this week. I missed the year.

15:06.293 --> 15:09.319
And Dr. Rabinow, if
everything's back to normal,

15:09.396 --> 15:12.661
why am I still half a second slow on
the 40 than I was before the injury?

15:12.732 --> 15:15.167
Well, Smash, your
progress has been great.

15:15.236 --> 15:19.730
But there's no guarantee that you'll
regain the same speed you had pre-injury.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.438
So you're saying this is
the fastest I'm gonna get?

15:23.511 --> 15:24.773
Possibly.

15:25.613 --> 15:30.050
Look, you need to be thankful for the
progress that you've made so far.

15:30.117 --> 15:33.280
And keep working at it,
and that's all you can do.

15:36.924 --> 15:39.620
Well? Hold on one second.
I'm almost done.

15:39.694 --> 15:41.389
Well, it's taking you
long enough.

15:41.495 --> 15:42.928
Well, there's a lot
of calculations...

15:42.997 --> 15:46.558
Landry, honey? Did you get to fix that toilet?
I really got to go.

15:46.634 --> 15:49.604
Yeah, I fixed it, but y'all are gonna
have to start flushing gently.

15:49.671 --> 15:52.868
And tell Mindy to stop putting
so much toilet paper in it.

15:52.941 --> 15:55.068
You are so smart,
thank you, you angel.

15:55.143 --> 15:57.202
Isn't he fantastic?
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

15:57.279 --> 15:59.804
Thank you, sweetheart.
You have fun.

16:04.019 --> 16:05.577
You see something?
Um...

16:05.654 --> 16:06.985
If I carry the one...

16:07.456 --> 16:08.616
What?

16:10.158 --> 16:11.420
Okay, so...

16:11.493 --> 16:15.452
In order for you to get a 3.5 GPA
overall, you're gonna need to get

16:16.164 --> 16:19.691
like a 6.4 GPA
this year,

16:20.836 --> 16:22.804
which is gonna be tough.

16:26.275 --> 16:30.644
I just wanted to say I'm so honored to
be here with you all this year, and...

16:30.847 --> 16:32.439
And I'm here to make
your jobs easier.

16:32.515 --> 16:35.507
I'm here to make us all
the best educators we can be.

16:35.585 --> 16:39.316
So please, I want open dialogue,
I want you all to speak up,

16:39.389 --> 16:41.220
and I wanna open
the floor right now,

16:41.290 --> 16:45.021
for questions or comments or
concerns or anything, and...

16:45.261 --> 16:47.354
Anybody. I'd love to hear.

16:48.464 --> 16:49.590
Bill.

16:49.665 --> 16:54.728
Any chance the four teachers that got
laid off are gonna return? Be replaced?

16:54.804 --> 16:57.238
Well, you know, we're working
through the budget right now.

16:57.306 --> 16:58.864
It's tricky, that's
gonna be a tricky one,

16:58.941 --> 17:01.240
and I know it's gonna weigh
on each and every one of you,

17:01.311 --> 17:03.871
'cause we're all gonna...
So we're not even gonna get a Spanish teacher

17:03.947 --> 17:06.415
that actually speaks Spanish?
How about supplies?

17:06.483 --> 17:10.078
I've been teaching out of the
same history book for 15 years.

17:11.121 --> 17:12.452
You know, I do have
textbooks in the budget.

17:12.522 --> 17:14.548
Did you know a lot of us
buy our own supplies?

17:14.625 --> 17:16.183
Yes.
It's true.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.992
I'll start making a list.
I'll at least try to get...

17:19.063 --> 17:20.621
How about just
getting us some paper?

17:20.897 --> 17:22.559
All right!
Let's go!

17:22.633 --> 17:24.760
What's your read, Matt?
Black eight!

17:24.867 --> 17:26.494
Black eight, hut!

17:28.872 --> 17:30.362
Throw the ball!
Throw the ball!

17:30.441 --> 17:31.965
Get rid of it!

17:32.342 --> 17:35.106
Saracen, Riggins,
get over here! Come here!

17:35.346 --> 17:36.938
Let's go, Riggins!
Let's go!

17:39.350 --> 17:41.250
Is there something going on
I need to know about?

17:44.289 --> 17:47.622
Let me tell you two something, you
better get it together right now.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.991
'Cause if you don't, I will
replace you, I promise you that.

17:51.062 --> 17:52.120
You got me?

17:52.197 --> 17:53.221
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

17:53.298 --> 17:54.765
Make it work.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.499
Let's go out there and run
it the right way. Let's go.

17:57.569 --> 17:59.696
Let's go. MAN: Come on, let's move it!
Look alive! Let's go!

18:01.106 --> 18:04.007
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that?

18:04.576 --> 18:07.272
It's smoothies. J.D.
McCoy's daddy bought us all smoothies.

18:07.345 --> 18:09.006
Not for now, for after the
practice, when we're done.

18:09.314 --> 18:10.576
Smoothies?

18:10.648 --> 18:13.675
Yeah, those frosty, tangy things
with the non-fat yogurt...

18:13.752 --> 18:15.413
I know what the hell
a smoothie is.

18:16.188 --> 18:18.452
Tell him to get the
hell off the field.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.692
You mean for good, or to
come back later? Or what?

18:20.759 --> 18:22.522
I mean, tell him we don't
need any damn smoothies.

18:22.595 --> 18:24.495
All right...
All right, all right.

18:25.264 --> 18:28.427
Get that pink-ass truck off the field!
Just get him out of here!

18:28.868 --> 18:31.336
Just move
it off the premises! Let's go!

18:32.605 --> 18:34.539
Damn! I wanted
a smoothie, man.

18:35.107 --> 18:36.972
What was that, Charles?

18:37.443 --> 18:39.070
What did you say?
You want a smoothie?

18:39.145 --> 18:41.272
Yes. You know what?
I'd like a smoothie too, Charles.

18:41.647 --> 18:42.875
It'd be good, wouldn't it?

18:42.948 --> 18:44.939
But you know why I'm not gonna
have a smoothie, Charles?

18:45.017 --> 18:47.111
'Cause I don't feel like
I deserve a smoothie!

18:47.187 --> 18:50.054
Does anybody else out here feel
like you deserve a smoothie?

18:51.625 --> 18:53.684
I'll tell you what,
we win Friday night,

18:53.760 --> 18:56.388
and you can have all the damn
smoothies you want, gentlemen.

18:56.463 --> 18:57.521
Let's go!

19:00.700 --> 19:03.100
Tyra! Hey!

19:04.237 --> 19:06.467
Hey, is everything okay?
Fine.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.905
Where are you going?
Ditching class.

19:08.041 --> 19:10.339
Wait a minute. Uh-uh.
No, you're not ditching class.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.344
Come here. What are you doing?
You're not ditching class.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.902
It's your senior year.
After all we've talked about...

19:13.980 --> 19:15.777
Why? Why?
So I can get into Dillon Tech?

19:16.216 --> 19:17.774
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

19:17.851 --> 19:20.786
Well, that's the only college I'm gonna
be able to get into, ain't that right?

19:20.854 --> 19:22.914
Wait a minute, hon.
Hold on. Hold on. No.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.982
You filled my head with all
of these possibilities, okay?

19:26.060 --> 19:27.118
What are you talking about?

19:27.195 --> 19:29.060
TMU, University of Texas.
That's right.

19:29.130 --> 19:31.064
Yeah, but none of that is
possible with my grades, is it?

19:31.132 --> 19:33.191
It's not just about grades.
Oh, it's not just about grades?

19:33.267 --> 19:37.260
The average student getting
into UT has a 3.8, TMU is 3.7.

19:37.838 --> 19:39.669
Well, so what?
I never said it was gonna be easy.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.072
But you never said it was
gonna be impossible.

19:42.243 --> 19:44.211
I've worked my ass off
these last two years.

19:44.278 --> 19:45.472
I know!

19:46.514 --> 19:48.846
You know, Mr. Trucks,
he had a good point.

19:49.217 --> 19:50.411
I got to be more realistic.

19:51.519 --> 19:53.817
Wait a minute, honey...
Put my time to better use.

19:53.888 --> 19:54.877
No, ma'am!

19:54.956 --> 19:57.424
No, ma'am.
You come back here right now. Tyra!

19:57.491 --> 19:59.483
You come back here right now!

19:59.561 --> 20:02.553
Girl! Listen!
After all we've been through.

20:02.864 --> 20:04.525
Don't do this!

20:04.600 --> 20:06.261
Tyra, don't do it.

20:14.476 --> 20:16.068
Julie, let's go!

20:17.779 --> 20:18.871
Here.

20:19.748 --> 20:20.908
Wow. Eggs.
What's the occasion?

20:20.983 --> 20:23.008
The occasion is, your mother wants
you to start eating breakfast

20:23.085 --> 20:25.747
because it's the most important meal of
the day, that's what the occasion is.

20:25.821 --> 20:27.379
Dad, I only eat
free-range eggs.

20:27.456 --> 20:30.289
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard. Eat your eggs.

20:31.326 --> 20:33.795
So you got dumped with
me and Gracie again?

20:34.030 --> 20:38.023
No, your mother had to deal with an
urgent air-conditioning situation.

20:38.101 --> 20:39.193
You know if I had my own car,

20:39.269 --> 20:40.600
I could drop Gracie off
in the morning

20:40.670 --> 20:41.659
and pick her up at night.

20:41.738 --> 20:44.104
Well, you don't have you own car.
Sit down, eat your eggs. We'll be late.

20:44.173 --> 20:45.333
Well, I can fix
my schedule right, okay?

20:45.408 --> 20:47.535
So Mom wanted me to take
an AP English class,

20:47.610 --> 20:50.306
and Mr. Munios is teaching AP
English class in third period,

20:50.380 --> 20:51.972
so I could take seventh
and eighth period free,

20:52.048 --> 20:55.984
and then take social studies during
fifth period as an independent study.

20:56.085 --> 20:57.177
Uh-huh.

20:57.253 --> 20:59.687
And today is the last day
I can make schedule changes,

20:59.756 --> 21:01.621
so I was hoping you could sign.

21:01.691 --> 21:05.183
Sign? Honey, I'm not gonna sign off
on anything without your mom's permission.

21:05.261 --> 21:08.094
Dad, please. I've been trying to get
her all week, she's been so busy.

21:08.164 --> 21:09.655
Hang on. I know.
Sorry. I can't do that.

21:09.733 --> 21:10.859
Is it something
you want me to do?

21:10.934 --> 21:12.094
You want me
to get a job, right?

21:12.169 --> 21:14.967
You want me to become more
responsible, join the work force,

21:15.039 --> 21:19.100
set goals for myself, become an
adult, become independent, right?

21:21.512 --> 21:22.706
Please?

21:30.621 --> 21:32.851
Sit down, eat your eggs
and I'll look at it.

21:34.558 --> 21:37.186
She's throwing riddles
at me, Williams.

21:38.228 --> 21:39.695
What do I do?

21:40.331 --> 21:43.391
This is in exchange
for shutting up about Lyla.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.466
All right?
All right.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.495
I heard you're playing
my old position.

21:49.407 --> 21:51.432
How's life at tailback?

21:53.044 --> 21:54.102
You want the truth?

21:55.280 --> 21:57.407
I'd go back to fullback
in a heartbeat.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.974
I got Coach, I got 7 riding
my ass every single day

22:01.052 --> 22:02.383
like I asked for the gig.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.445
And you're gonna like this one,

22:04.522 --> 22:08.458
I'm reminded every single day I'm
out there I'm no Smash Williams.

22:08.526 --> 22:10.721
We in the same boat, Rigg.

22:11.296 --> 22:14.322
I've just been told I'm not
Smash Williams, either.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.231
What do you mean?
The knee.

22:17.469 --> 22:18.731
I'm slow.

22:19.437 --> 22:22.999
Doctor said I'm as good as done, but
Coach thinks I should keep trying.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.341
Okay, wait.

22:27.747 --> 22:31.478
Doctor says
you can't do it, right?

22:32.752 --> 22:33.912
Right?

22:35.154 --> 22:36.781
What's the issue?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.051
That's a very good question.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.324
Your love line is so deep.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.660
Oh, yeah, it is.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.563
You know what that means, right?
No.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.568
It means you're, like,
really good in bed.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.498
Yeah, you know, I've actually heard
all the stories about you, Tim.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.439
Good ones or what?
Yeah.

22:56.510 --> 22:59.604
But, I mean, I've never gotten to,
like, experience it for myself.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.147
No, you haven't.
Get off him, Jolene.

23:07.621 --> 23:09.452
Jolene Pinchel, Tim?
Really?

23:10.724 --> 23:12.055
Well, I mean...

23:13.293 --> 23:14.817
Why is it the minute
you walk into this school

23:14.895 --> 23:16.522
you turn into some dumb jock?

23:16.596 --> 23:19.429
What is the problem with
being a Panther, now?

23:19.499 --> 23:21.626
Everything! Everything!
And everyone looks at you

23:21.701 --> 23:23.862
as, like, the pinnacle
of the dumbest part of it.

23:23.937 --> 23:26.371
And you just totally
play into it.

23:27.707 --> 23:28.799
I've no idea what
you're talking about.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.342
Really? Really?

23:30.410 --> 23:33.642
You know what the problem really is,
is that you don't take me seriously.

23:33.748 --> 23:35.875
It's like I'm
some fling to you.

23:35.950 --> 23:37.679
You're not a fling.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.951
Okay, then what's the problem?

23:43.958 --> 23:46.688
Shoot. Okay. You wanna know
what the problem is, Tim?

23:48.629 --> 23:50.096
You scare me.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.557
I scare you?
Yeah. You scare me.

23:53.634 --> 23:55.534
You're Tim Riggins.

23:55.603 --> 23:57.662
You show up drunk to school.
You don't do your...

23:57.738 --> 24:01.799
You have rally girls do your homework for you.
You don't go to class. You...

24:02.143 --> 24:05.442
Your relationships last
about 20 minutes.

24:05.513 --> 24:06.845
How am I supposed to
take you seriously

24:06.915 --> 24:08.849
if you don't
take yourself seriously?

24:21.964 --> 24:23.431
Hey, Coach.

24:23.499 --> 24:25.797
I'm sorry to barge in on you,
I don't mean to bother you.

24:25.868 --> 24:29.429
But you know, I had to stop by and apologize
for those smoothies the other day.

24:29.505 --> 24:32.065
'Cause that was one
dumbass move.

24:32.140 --> 24:34.802
You know, I heard on the
radio, record high,

24:34.877 --> 24:37.277
so I figured I'd make
this big gesture,

24:37.346 --> 24:40.941
and now you must think I'm just one of
those in-your-face football dads now.

24:41.016 --> 24:42.348
So, sorry,

24:42.418 --> 24:43.885
that is my apology.

24:44.821 --> 24:47.016
I can't take that.
Oh, come on.

24:47.090 --> 24:50.116
That's a nice bottle of Scotch,
and those are two Cuban cigars.

24:50.193 --> 24:51.626
So if I were you,
I would take those.

24:51.694 --> 24:53.753
I'm sure they are,
but I can't take that.

24:55.765 --> 24:57.323
Can I tell you what I hate?

24:58.268 --> 25:01.897
I hate all those bozos on the
radio clamoring for your job.

25:02.872 --> 25:04.965
All those people that say
you made a mistake

25:05.041 --> 25:06.804
building an offense
around Smash Williams.

25:06.876 --> 25:08.434
Now, where were those people

25:08.578 --> 25:12.173
when you won the state championship
with that strategy? Please!

25:12.248 --> 25:15.376
If you have a star like Smash,

25:15.451 --> 25:18.182
you build a team
around him. Period.

25:19.156 --> 25:20.316
We just need a couple of wins.

25:20.391 --> 25:21.881
That'll shut them up.

25:21.959 --> 25:23.824
It probably won't,
but it's a start.

25:24.061 --> 25:26.586
And what you did
with Matt Saracen,

25:27.231 --> 25:28.960
that truly amazes me.

25:29.033 --> 25:30.557
Well, he's a great talent.

25:30.634 --> 25:33.432
That's the thing.
He is not a great talent.

25:33.504 --> 25:35.472
He is an average talent.

25:35.539 --> 25:38.872
He is 5'9",
he runs a 4'7, 9'40,

25:38.943 --> 25:40.570
and he has
a mediocre arm at best.

25:40.644 --> 25:44.512
Only a great coach like you could've
ever made it to State with him.

25:44.582 --> 25:46.709
I don't know about that.
I do.

25:46.784 --> 25:48.308
That's why I'm here, Coach.

25:48.452 --> 25:50.181
My boy, J.D.

25:51.188 --> 25:52.951
He's the real deal.

25:53.725 --> 25:57.855
He is a great quarterback, and I
want him mentored by a great coach.

25:57.929 --> 26:01.456
And that is why I moved my
family to Dillon, Texas.

26:03.034 --> 26:05.002
Sir, are you telling me that you
moved down here from Dallas

26:05.103 --> 26:07.537
just for this football team?
For you, sir.

26:08.273 --> 26:09.604
For you.

26:09.975 --> 26:12.705
You are looking
at the next Jason Street.

26:13.011 --> 26:15.104
You got a franchise sitting
right under your nose.

26:17.382 --> 26:19.247
All you gotta do is sniff.

26:20.585 --> 26:22.485
Anyway...
I can't take these.

26:22.621 --> 26:24.521
Well now, a gift given
is a gift given.

26:24.589 --> 26:27.717
If you care to pass it on to
somebody else, be my guest.

26:27.792 --> 26:29.192
I'm looking forward to Friday.

26:29.261 --> 26:31.286
Hope J.D. gets some snaps.

26:40.239 --> 26:42.400
Hey.
Hey.

26:43.109 --> 26:45.543
It's 9:45. I know.
I had to stay

26:47.146 --> 26:51.845
and make photocopies of the new
budget for the whole staff

26:51.917 --> 26:57.287
because the district won't let
us pay secretaries overtime.

26:57.390 --> 27:00.291
And you know what else?
Miss Walker quit.

27:00.893 --> 27:03.589
'Cause she's going to St.
Matthews, 'cause at St. Matthews,

27:03.663 --> 27:06.827
they have smaller classes
and they have resources.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.027
So that's where she's going.

27:11.505 --> 27:12.665
Wow.

27:14.474 --> 27:15.873
I feel like an idiot.

27:15.942 --> 27:19.343
I thought I was gonna go in there
with all my great ideas, and...

27:21.348 --> 27:23.873
They don't need my great ideas.
They just need money, that's all they need.

27:23.950 --> 27:25.440
Don't do that.

27:26.687 --> 27:30.054
Come here. You'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

27:30.123 --> 27:31.750
Mmm-hmm.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.685
It's early on.

27:37.931 --> 27:39.900
Five years from now, you'll
look back and laugh on it.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.093
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"

27:42.336 --> 27:44.770
Come on.
You're just trying to get laid.

27:45.173 --> 27:46.504
It's 9:45.

27:47.108 --> 27:48.336
Honey...

27:50.511 --> 27:51.773
Is this Julie's new schedule?

27:51.846 --> 27:53.108
Mmm-hmm.

27:54.048 --> 27:55.777
Oh, shoot.

27:56.784 --> 28:00.515
She's in stupid Munios's
English AP class.

28:00.588 --> 28:02.249
I signed it. It's all right.
I signed it for her.

28:02.323 --> 28:03.449
What are you talking about?

28:03.524 --> 28:05.515
You did not tell her
that was all right.

28:05.593 --> 28:06.924
That was the
whole conversation,

28:06.994 --> 28:08.461
is that she needs
to take AP English...

28:08.529 --> 28:09.791
She is taking an
AP English class.

28:09.864 --> 28:11.832
With Dr. Wells.
Julie!

28:12.767 --> 28:14.029
Should I not have
signed it for her?

28:14.102 --> 28:15.228
Julie.

28:15.303 --> 28:17.101
She needed someone to sign
the piece of paper Honey...

28:17.172 --> 28:20.164
'cause she was going to school that morning
and she couldn't get in touch with you.

28:20.242 --> 28:22.233
She said she's been trying to talk
to you about it and she can't,

28:22.311 --> 28:25.212
so I signed it for her.
Honey, we're gonna have to change the schedule.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.908
Well, we can't change it.
Dad already signed off on it.

28:28.450 --> 28:30.008
Did you not understand
the part where I said

28:30.085 --> 28:33.077
that you needed to be in Dr.
Wells' English class, no matter what?

28:33.155 --> 28:35.589
Mom, they are both AP
English teachers, correct?

28:35.657 --> 28:37.648
That is correct.
But as you well know,

28:37.726 --> 28:40.251
Dr. Wells is a much more
experienced, much better teacher.

28:40.329 --> 28:43.162
It's all taken care of, and yesterday
was the last day you could change it.

28:43.232 --> 28:44.597
That's why I signed it.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.293
Well, you know
what's a great thing?

28:46.368 --> 28:48.359
The great thing is,
I'm the principal.

28:48.437 --> 28:51.134
And that's something I can change.
So that's gonna be changed, okay?

28:51.207 --> 28:53.437
Mom, you can't do...
End of discussion!

28:53.510 --> 28:54.841
Why are you getting so mad?

28:54.911 --> 28:56.936
There is a baby asleep in this house.
Don't you raise your voices.

28:57.013 --> 28:58.002
Did you know you're supposed...

28:58.081 --> 28:59.844
That is the end
of the discussion!

29:00.350 --> 29:01.476
Come here.

29:01.551 --> 29:04.645
Did you know you weren't supposed
to be in Munios's class?

29:04.721 --> 29:06.086
I'm asking.

29:06.723 --> 29:10.181
When you see that car in our
driveway, you're gonna be 25.

29:26.409 --> 29:28.105
You know what we're
looking at right now?

29:28.179 --> 29:30.374
Yeah, a bunch of white people
that can't dance

29:30.447 --> 29:31.505
and need to lose
a lot of weight.

29:31.582 --> 29:34.676
My future, Landry.
Right there, right in front of me.

29:34.752 --> 29:37.243
I'm gonna become my
sister, then my momma.

29:38.289 --> 29:40.655
Why'd I think I'd be
any different, you know?

29:41.058 --> 29:42.889
Stop. Stop!

29:43.561 --> 29:44.994
Shop! Just...
Come on. Shh.

29:45.095 --> 29:47.495
This guy seems like
he's got something to say.

29:47.565 --> 29:49.192
Let's listen him out.

29:50.768 --> 29:52.360
Shut your mouth!
Come on!

29:53.838 --> 29:55.396
Mindy Collette.

29:55.472 --> 29:58.100
I know we've only been
dating for five weeks,

29:58.175 --> 30:02.636
and, you know, when we started
dating, I saw a future for you

30:03.081 --> 30:04.810
and me here...

30:04.883 --> 30:06.646
Here in Dillon, Texas,

30:06.718 --> 30:12.987
I see you and me having, like, three or four
little Mindys and Billys running around,

30:13.124 --> 30:15.718
maybe... Maybe less.
But, uh...

30:15.794 --> 30:19.890
I humble myself here at
Seven Señoritas Cantina,

30:20.031 --> 30:22.898
and I ask you,
will you marry me?

30:24.069 --> 30:26.060
Will you spend the rest
of your life with me?

30:29.407 --> 30:30.465
Yes!

30:49.996 --> 30:52.897
Oh. Honey, honey,
don't be blue.

30:52.965 --> 30:55.900
There's a man for you in Dillon,
right here, maybe in this room.

30:56.836 --> 30:58.463
I gotta sit down.

31:10.850 --> 31:11.908
Hey, honey.

31:11.984 --> 31:14.044
Billy Riggins just proposed
to my sister.

31:15.355 --> 31:17.846
Congratulations. No, no.
It's not worth congratulating.

31:17.925 --> 31:19.916
They're just gonna have a kid
and get divorced,

31:19.993 --> 31:23.292
and Mindy's gonna spend the rest of her
life going after Billy for child support.

31:24.598 --> 31:26.361
Look, I love
my sister. I do.

31:26.433 --> 31:29.596
And I want her to be happy,
and I hope she will be.

31:30.804 --> 31:32.772
But I don't wanna
end up like her.

31:32.839 --> 31:37.276
And the thing is, is that I am good at math.
I'm good with numbers.

31:37.344 --> 31:39.812
I would be great
at business, and, you know,

31:39.880 --> 31:42.280
I want that for myself.
I want that so badly.

31:42.349 --> 31:44.442
I'd do anything
to go to college.

31:44.518 --> 31:47.248
But, see, the thing is, Vice-Principal
Trucks, he thinks I'm a moron.

31:47.321 --> 31:48.983
And I know that you're
the principal now,

31:49.057 --> 31:50.456
and I'm so proud
of you for that,

31:50.525 --> 31:52.516
and I know you're
super busy, but...

31:53.995 --> 31:55.622
I need your help.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.833
Come on in, honey.
Come on. Come on.

32:17.752 --> 32:19.151
You're late.

32:21.155 --> 32:22.884
You're not dressed.

32:23.424 --> 32:25.017
What's going on?

32:25.127 --> 32:26.719
I'm not gonna do this
anymore, Coach T.

32:29.999 --> 32:32.297
Well, you're not gonna do what?

32:33.168 --> 32:36.069
Pretend like I got a shot in
hell of getting a scholarship,

32:37.039 --> 32:39.564
or playing football again.
Look, it's over.

32:42.745 --> 32:43.905
You let me
tell you something...

32:43.979 --> 32:47.073
Look, I appreciate everything
you've been doing,

32:47.983 --> 32:51.043
but the truth is, I'm
never gonna be who I was.

32:52.988 --> 32:55.582
I gotta start living
my life as Brian.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.856
I'm never gonna be Smash again.

33:09.172 --> 33:11.697
All right, Brian.
It's your decision.

33:14.878 --> 33:16.971
Thanks for everything, Coach.

33:17.047 --> 33:19.982
I had the best time
of my life on this field.

33:41.839 --> 33:45.275
Miss Collette. Here's my application
for the University of Texas.

33:45.342 --> 33:46.707
I'd appreciate
your thoughts on it.

33:46.777 --> 33:49.473
Also, I'm gonna be running for
Student Council President.

33:49.547 --> 33:51.481
Here is my petition
with all my signatures.

33:51.649 --> 33:52.946
One more thing.

33:53.017 --> 33:55.042
Don't tell me that I
can't get into college

33:55.286 --> 33:56.480
ever again.

33:56.554 --> 33:58.818
If I don't get in, then
you can call me an idiot.

33:58.889 --> 34:00.823
But I don't wanna hear that
from you again.

34:00.891 --> 34:04.156
See, I don't accept
that fate for myself,

34:04.228 --> 34:06.753
and I'm gonna do everything
in my power to avoid it.

34:12.603 --> 34:13.935
Hey, hon.

34:19.945 --> 34:22.846
You were right, about
the whole Julie thing.

34:25.350 --> 34:28.114
I should have spoken to you
about that beforehand.

34:28.186 --> 34:30.518
Well, I think that's true,

34:30.621 --> 34:33.853
you know, I wouldn't have done
that myself, the way you did,

34:33.925 --> 34:36.155
but I know she needed to
have more of a conversation,

34:36.228 --> 34:38.321
I know I was not
available for that...

34:42.868 --> 34:44.391
Thank you for the apology.

34:44.469 --> 34:46.768
I didn't want you to be mad
at me on big opening night.

34:46.839 --> 34:48.739
I can never be mad at my wife.

34:48.808 --> 34:50.036
It's that damn principal.

34:50.576 --> 34:53.443
All right. She's got to
get back to work.

34:53.513 --> 34:55.777
All right. See?
I'm not mad at you.

34:59.852 --> 35:01.717
Is that a new computer?
Mmm-hmm.

35:03.256 --> 35:05.986
Didn't y'all just get new
computers the year before...

35:06.058 --> 35:09.619
Couple years ago. These are networked
so we can communicate in-house.

35:10.930 --> 35:12.659
How nice for you.

35:14.834 --> 35:17.325
How is it so cool in here?

35:17.403 --> 35:19.769
It feels like it's 68 degrees.

35:19.906 --> 35:21.134
It's the way I like it.

35:22.276 --> 35:24.176
It's the way I like it.

35:28.048 --> 35:30.448
The long dry
season is over, folks.

35:30.517 --> 35:32.382
We are finally back
under the lights,

35:32.452 --> 35:35.478
and we are ready
to play some football.

35:36.590 --> 35:37.648
Set!

35:38.692 --> 35:40.751
Matt Saracen
lines up on the center.

35:42.229 --> 35:44.754
He steps back
and pitches it to Riggins.

35:44.831 --> 35:46.560
Riggins has it.
He's got room!

35:46.633 --> 35:49.796
He cuts up the middle. Oh, my!
He runs through the secondary,

35:49.870 --> 35:51.394
puts his shoulder down,

35:51.471 --> 35:54.872
and Riggins has smashed his
way through the secondary

35:54.942 --> 35:59.073
and the Dillon Panthers are
in the red zone, play one.

35:59.147 --> 36:01.047
Whoo-ee, what a start.

36:08.556 --> 36:10.148
Saracen back.

36:10.592 --> 36:12.958
He options to Riggins.
He cuts inside.

36:13.027 --> 36:15.621
Big stiff arm.
He clears another tackle.

36:15.697 --> 36:19.326
Riggins running like a man possessed!
He's in the barn, folks!

36:19.400 --> 36:21.300
Touchdown, Panthers!

36:24.472 --> 36:26.372
Saracen over the ball.

36:26.441 --> 36:27.601
Hut!

36:27.709 --> 36:29.609
Here's the snap.
He brings it back...

36:29.677 --> 36:31.838
Whoa! Saracen,
he's gonna keep it!

36:31.913 --> 36:34.849
Nice little move on the inside,
he's picked up some blockers.

36:35.017 --> 36:38.885
And it is a touchdown
for Matt Saracen!

36:46.895 --> 36:50.353
It's a hand-off to Riggins, up the middle.
He's got one man to beat!

36:50.432 --> 36:53.993
Oh, and he's airborne!
Touchdown, Tim Riggins!

36:54.570 --> 36:56.538
He ain't no
Smash Williams, folks,

36:56.605 --> 37:00.041
but Tim Riggins is smashing
everything in his path.

37:00.109 --> 37:02.543
It's a brand new year
for the Dillon Panthers,

37:02.611 --> 37:06.172
and Coach Taylor is putting
on a clinic here tonight.

37:13.957 --> 37:16.357
Coach Taylor is taking out
his starting backfield.

37:16.426 --> 37:20.089
They've done an absolutely
outstanding job tonight.

37:21.865 --> 37:27.929
And here he comes, folks. J.D.
"Young Gun" McCoy, the phenom from Big D.

37:28.505 --> 37:33.533
Go, Panthers, go!
Go, Panthers, go!

37:33.977 --> 37:35.968
J.D. takes the snap.

37:36.046 --> 37:39.447
McCoy is back to pass.
He sets up, and he fires.

37:39.516 --> 37:42.815
Oh! He throws a strike
and completion up the middle.

37:43.119 --> 37:44.108
Good job! Yeah!

37:45.456 --> 37:50.792
McCoy is really looking sharp
here in these closing minutes.

37:53.531 --> 37:54.520
Hut!

38:06.210 --> 38:09.077
Oh, my God!
A perfect pass!

38:09.146 --> 38:13.276
Just sailed on the wings of
angels into the receiver's hands.

38:13.684 --> 38:17.552
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
Jason Street reincarnated.

38:17.822 --> 38:20.417
That boy can throw a football!

39:09.876 --> 39:11.309
It's completely digital.

39:11.377 --> 39:14.039
It's got 7.1 surround sound.

39:14.113 --> 39:18.140
It is just a beautiful
JumboTron, I'm telling you.

39:18.484 --> 39:21.647
Tami Taylor is the brain child
behind all of this.

39:21.721 --> 39:23.348
I think we should
give her the credit.

39:23.923 --> 39:26.391
The JumboTron!
Oh, the JumboTron!

39:26.459 --> 39:32.729
It is gonna bring us national attention, too.
We're talking ESPN, baby.

39:33.333 --> 39:34.391
Can I talk to you
for a quick sec?

39:34.468 --> 39:35.457
Absolutely.

39:35.536 --> 39:36.628
All right.
Excuse me.

39:36.703 --> 39:40.799
You know what? I can't stop worrying about
all the things that the school needs.

39:40.874 --> 39:43.934
You know, I mean, the school
needs basic, basic things.

39:44.044 --> 39:46.069
Like teachers, for one.
Yeah.

39:46.146 --> 39:49.843
You know, and pencils, and
chalk, and textbooks, and...

39:49.917 --> 39:52.112
I mean, we need those things.
I know.

39:52.186 --> 39:54.450
I'm totally supportive
of the academics.

39:54.521 --> 39:56.785
Last year, we did the bake
sale, we did the cake sell.

39:56.857 --> 40:00.122
You know, we did I think $3,000
on that Howdy Doody thing.

40:00.794 --> 40:02.193
We can do that again...
Buddy, Buddy.

40:02.262 --> 40:03.559
I have decided,

40:03.630 --> 40:08.295
I'm going to reallocate the
JumboTron funds to academics.

40:10.605 --> 40:13.438
No, wait, Tami, the funds
have been earmarked...

40:13.508 --> 40:16.102
I've checked with the district.
It turns out, according to the bylaws,

40:16.177 --> 40:19.704
the principal has the final jurisdiction
over the allocation of funds.

40:19.781 --> 40:22.249
In the past, the way
we've always done it...

40:22.317 --> 40:25.684
Well, Buddy, this year,
it's gonna be different.

40:26.521 --> 40:27.954
I'm sorry.

40:29.591 --> 40:31.218
See you. Bye.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.084
Hey.
Hey.

40:33.161 --> 40:34.856
How are you?
Good.

40:34.929 --> 40:37.056
Two things.
Thank you

40:38.132 --> 40:40.999
for kind of kicking my ass in
gear, 'cause I know I needed it.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.504
And I kind of owe
tonight to you.

40:44.707 --> 40:46.140
And two,

40:46.208 --> 40:48.733
I'm okay if you don't
tell anyone about us.

40:49.078 --> 40:51.376
As long as this works with you.

40:52.815 --> 40:54.442
Wow.

40:54.517 --> 40:56.041
All right.

40:58.988 --> 41:00.785
Tim.
Yeah?

41:21.144 --> 41:22.839
Hi, Steve.
How are you doing?

41:22.913 --> 41:25.074
Hey, Coach. Nice win.
Congratulations.

41:25.148 --> 41:26.809
Thanks for putting
my boy in there.

41:26.883 --> 41:29.010
Well, you know what, we always
give the other boys a chance,

41:29.085 --> 41:30.347
once we got one in the bag.

41:30.420 --> 41:31.717
Well, I appreciate it.

41:31.788 --> 41:33.119
You're very welcome.
All right.

41:34.591 --> 41:36.058
Coach? Good job.

41:40.730 --> 41:44.325
Thank you, everybody!
Without further ado,

41:44.401 --> 41:46.301
ladies and gentlemen,

41:46.369 --> 41:48.496
great moments of Panthers play!

42:41.994 --> 42:44.019
Yeah! Smash!

43:10.657 --> 43:12.522
Hey.

43:14.460 --> 43:15.654
Get in.

43:17.263 --> 43:19.254
You realize this is the whitest
sport in history, right?

43:32.645 --> 43:33.669
It's yours.

43:33.746 --> 43:34.940
My point, Coach.

44:07.681 --> 44:09.239
You know what?
You wanna work at the Alamo Freeze?

44:09.316 --> 44:11.910
I don't give a damn.
You go ahead, you work at the Alamo Freeze.

44:11.985 --> 44:15.250
But look me in the eye and you tell
me you don't wanna play football.

44:15.322 --> 44:17.814
I didn't say I didn't
want to, I said I can't.

44:23.865 --> 44:25.730
I don't buy that crap.

44:27.102 --> 44:28.967
Look, I lost my scholarship,

44:29.904 --> 44:31.166
I'm slow,

44:31.906 --> 44:33.806
and no school wants me.

44:34.442 --> 44:35.807
How's that?

44:36.211 --> 44:37.701
Look, man.
I don't know how it works.

44:37.779 --> 44:39.747
Maybe you have
to change your game.

44:39.814 --> 44:42.044
Humble yourself.
I don't know.

44:42.584 --> 44:44.552
But I can promise you this.

44:44.619 --> 44:46.416
We can figure it out.

44:46.688 --> 44:49.418
If you want this,
I will help you get it.

44:50.658 --> 44:52.786
Into college,
and playing football again.

44:52.862 --> 44:57.196
And I can promise you I won't
stop until you get there.

45:01.537 --> 45:03.732
Can I ask you why this
means so much to you?

45:04.707 --> 45:07.335
'Cause I need
something good to happen.

45:34.070 --> 45:37.005
There is nothing wrong
with your knee.

45:37.073 --> 45:40.008
Man, if you want this,
it is waiting for you.

45:44.514 --> 45:46.482
I can't want it for you.
