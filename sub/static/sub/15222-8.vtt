00:01.434 --> 00:05.666
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.915 --> 00:18.679
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.752 --> 00:21.550
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.072
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.876
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.944 --> 00:47.276
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.347 --> 00:49.338
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

01:15.508 --> 01:17.442
Oh, boy.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.858
<i>Leaping in time has brought me
into many strange first encounters.</i>

02:44.931 --> 02:48.833
<i>But coming face-to-face with a dead man
is probably my least favorite.</i>

02:48.902 --> 02:51.564
<i>And it happened,
if I remember correctly, twice before,</i>

02:51.638 --> 02:54.869
<i>and each time the same words
echoed through my brain.</i>

02:54.941 --> 02:57.842
<i>"Too late.
Why am I too late?"</i>

02:57.911 --> 03:00.903
I found the canvas from that old tent
we used to take to the river.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.212
Bart Aider.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.953
Saints preserve us.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.694
Looks like Bailer's
moonshine finally won.

03:16.763 --> 03:20.529
- I'm the sheriff.
- You tellin' me or Bart?

03:20.600 --> 03:24.696
I was just thinkin' that, as the sheriff,
I should probably know... somethin'.

03:24.771 --> 03:28.468
I reckon if wearin' that badge gives you all
the answers, there's still hope for me, huh?

03:30.043 --> 03:34.480
Damn. Looks like he got smacked
right upside his head.

03:35.515 --> 03:38.211
<i>Now, who'd want to kill ol'Bart?</i>

03:39.852 --> 03:42.082
Looks like he was dead
before he got hit.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.816
How'd you figure that?
Just a guess.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.482
Oh.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.928
Well, Clayton, you gonna
stare at him all day or-

03:49.996 --> 03:53.762
Uh, I guess we should get him
back to, uh, town.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.233
Yeah. I think we should.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.239
All right.
Here we go.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.243
One, two, three.
Three.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.110
Poor boy.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.051
So what are you
gonna tell Leta?

04:19.358 --> 04:21.293
Mrs. Aider?

04:21.361 --> 04:25.855
Yeah, she damn near ripped your ears off last
time you brought Bart home, and he was alive.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.424
Well, maybe we should get the
autopsy started before we call her.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.027
Not an ice cube's chance in hell.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.508
The Deveux's ain't got a phone, and Doc Kinman and
Daisy are out in the boonies deliverin' her baby.

04:36.576 --> 04:40.342
You think that woman can drop another
baby after havin' 16 of them things?

04:40.413 --> 04:43.780
Sixteen? Or is
it 17? Cajuns.

04:56.262 --> 05:00.289
Well, that must've scared the hell out of
Abigail, comin' up on a dead man like that.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.698
I mean, I'm a grown man,
it gives me the willies.

05:05.571 --> 05:10.167
You know, at 10 years old, that daughter of yours
- She's seen enough grief for two lifetimes.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.513
Is she all right?
She what?

05:14.580 --> 05:20.348
Abigail. I mean, uh, I wanna
- I wanna go and see if she's all right.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.685
I thought you wanted to take Bart
- No.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.623
I want to make sure Abigail's
all right.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.924
<i>Sure, Clayton, no problem.
Guess it means I'm drivin'.</i>

05:49.882 --> 05:54.182
<i>I never like it when a leap starts out
at the bottom and goes downhill from there.</i>

05:54.253 --> 05:57.188
<i>All I could gather from my deputy
was that I was in Louisiana,</i>

05:57.256 --> 06:00.384
<i>and father to a little girl
who had stumbled upon a dead man-</i>

06:00.460 --> 06:02.553
<i>a dead man that somebody had
bludgeoned and pushed into the water.</i>

06:02.628 --> 06:04.619
Where do you want me
to take Bart?

06:04.697 --> 06:09.498
Uh, I guess take him to Doc's...

06:09.569 --> 06:11.662
and, uh-

06:11.738 --> 06:16.175
I told you, Doc Kinman and Daisy are in west hell. If
you think Will's spendin' the night with a dead man-

06:16.242 --> 06:18.676
O- Okay, uh,
the-the funeral home.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.940
Well, I guess he's gonna
end up there anyway.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.947
Hey, you want me
to call Leta for you?

06:23.015 --> 06:24.949
Yeah, that'd be great.
All right.

06:25.017 --> 06:28.248
And c-call me if there are any
problems. I will. I'll see ya'.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.520
<i>Daddy.! Daddy.!</i>

06:35.795 --> 06:37.786
Daddy,
I'm so glad you're home.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.059
She's been as nervous as a cat,
Sheriff Fuller.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.829
<i>Won't eat, and said she won't
go to bed until you got home.</i>

06:42.902 --> 06:47.066
He was there, wasn't he? Just
like I said it was, wasn't he?

06:48.074 --> 06:51.407
Yeah, he was.
He was- He was so mad.

06:51.477 --> 06:55.470
He was yellin' at me, and he was following me,
and I tried to hide, but he wouldn't go away.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.642
Abigail Fuller, you told me
he was dead when you come on him.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.983
I just said he was dead,
and I ran away.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.716
Was he alive? He was yellin'
at me to give back her locket.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.457
He said I had Violet's locket,
and I better give it back.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.625
Locket? It was supposed
to be my locket.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.793
Everybody knew it.

07:16.869 --> 07:20.532
Mama and I were saving all our money
to buy it, and they bought it first.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.040
But I didn't take it. I didn't!

07:23.109 --> 07:27.068
Miss Leta watched me search her
whole room. Here, I'll get it.

07:27.146 --> 07:30.309
And Abigail didn't have that child's
locket. I know that for a fact.

07:30.383 --> 07:34.251
Yeah, but why was
Mr. Aider yelling at you?

07:34.320 --> 07:36.254
I don't know.
No one ever believes me.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.688
Now wait a second.
I didn't say I didn't believe you.

07:38.758 --> 07:42.159
He was gonna hit me,
and I pulled away.

07:42.228 --> 07:45.322
When I looked back,
he was lyin' in the water.

07:45.398 --> 07:49.232
Won't this nightmare ever go away?
First Violet and now her daddy?

07:51.037 --> 07:53.938
Don't make me think
about it, Daddy. Don't.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.372
Okay, I won't.
I promise you, I won't.

07:56.442 --> 07:59.707
Take me on the swing, Dad. You go
on. I'll take your stuff inside.

07:59.779 --> 08:03.510
And I need you to fix the fuses.
Downstairs light is out again.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.710
Yes, ma'am.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.658
Daddy.
Yeah?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.659
Tell me all the ways
that you love me.

08:19.932 --> 08:25.768
Well, I love you like...
the stars love the sky.

08:27.206 --> 08:31.870
Like the... sea loves...
the sand.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.578
Like the flowers love the bees.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.881
I love you, Daddy.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.745
Sweet kid.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.145
That's such a great age, you know? Around nine, 10
- Shh!

09:12.285 --> 09:14.219
So who's gonna hear me?

09:14.287 --> 09:17.745
When's the last time a hologram
woke somebody up, huh? Al. Al?

09:17.823 --> 09:20.087
What's gonna happen to her?

09:20.159 --> 09:22.491
Well, we're a little jumpy
tonight, aren't we?

09:22.562 --> 09:25.463
Jumpy? Yeah, I'm a little jumpy.
It's been kind of an interesting day.

09:25.531 --> 09:29.262
I mean, I leap in standing over
the body of a dead man,

09:29.335 --> 09:33.066
and the last person to see him alive
is my 10-year-old daughter.

09:33.139 --> 09:37.098
So, yeah, I guess that makes me
a little jumpy.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.406
<i>Why am I here, Al?</i>

09:39.478 --> 09:43.847
<i>Uh, you're, uh, male, uh,
of the Caucasian persuasion,</i>

09:43.916 --> 09:46.441
uh, 40-ish, and you're, uh-

09:46.519 --> 09:50.114
Let's see, what's th- Sheriff-You're
a Sheriff of a small town. Al.

09:50.189 --> 09:53.283
I know that, okay? My last name is Fuller.
I have a daughter named Abigail.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.657
Now tell me something
that I don't know.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.822
Uh, well, you see, there was
a huge flood here in 1971,

09:58.898 --> 10:01.059
and it destroyed all the town records.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.499
But, no, we-we can
piece things together. It's just-

10:03.569 --> 10:05.969
It's gonna take a little time.
These are to Laura Fuller.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.268
Oh, is that the wife?
Yeah.

10:08.341 --> 10:13.643
They look like they're, uh- I don't know-
love letters or somethin' from me- uh, Clayton.

10:13.713 --> 10:17.843
- But they were never sent.
- Daddy? Who are you talkin' to?

10:20.620 --> 10:24.112
Uh, what are you doin' up, honey?
Don't blame me.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.353
I heard you talkin' to her.
Talkin' to-

10:27.426 --> 10:30.793
You still miss her, don't you?

10:30.863 --> 10:35.061
Miss her?
I miss her too.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.695
Oh. Sounds like the mother
must have died, poor kid.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.265
You mean, your mother.

10:42.341 --> 10:45.504
I talk to her sometimes.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.837
Come here.

10:49.849 --> 10:55.185
It's okay... to talk to people
that have gone away.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.883
It helps us keep them
in our hearts.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.654
Why won't she talk back?

11:01.727 --> 11:04.594
Ziggy doesn't have anything
on these people.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.326
<i>- But, you know, the mother could have-
- Don't say it.</i>

11:07.400 --> 11:10.563
Say what?
Um,

11:10.636 --> 11:13.332
see, it-it's just that sometimes...

11:13.406 --> 11:17.536
people don't have to say anything for
us to understand them in our hearts.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.711
I love you so much, Daddy.
I love you too.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.753
You won't ever go away, will you?
No.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.754
Promise you won't ever go away?

11:31.190 --> 11:36.321
I promise I will be here
as long as you need me.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.829
Now come on.
Get to bed. It's late.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.966
Let's have a picnic
tomorrow, Daddy. A picnic?

11:45.037 --> 11:48.529
Just you and me. And I'll get
all dressed up and pick you up.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.541
Won't that be lovely?

11:50.609 --> 11:54.170
That'd be lovely.
Now go get some sleep.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.180
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.153
<i>She's a real sweetie, isn't she?</i>

12:04.757 --> 12:06.987
Don't tell me that she dies, Al.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.325
No. No, Ziggy's got nada.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.264
Well, find something, all right? Uh,
well, that's what I'm tryin' to do.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.767
You don't really think something's
gonna happen to that little girl?

12:16.836 --> 12:18.963
Isn't that what you're
supposed to tell me?

12:19.038 --> 12:21.506
I just told you.
Ziggy's got zip, zilch, zero.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.977
Look, uh, I think maybe
she saw somethin', you know?

12:26.045 --> 12:29.811
Uh, she saw somebody hit
or-or push this Bart Aider guy,

12:29.882 --> 12:33.010
and she's in danger, and that's
why I'm here. Bart... Aider.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.019
Bart Aider.
He followed her, right?

12:35.087 --> 12:37.647
They had an argument, and then
Abigail said he fell. Uh-huh.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.487
Oh. This is the guy that died.
Yes, this is the guy-

12:40.559 --> 12:42.789
Well, how do you know
somebody pushed him?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.853
I don't know anything.
Oh, you don't?

12:44.930 --> 12:49.026
And I won't know anything until the town
doctor comes back and does an autopsy,

12:49.101 --> 12:51.035
or you and Ziggy
get me some data.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.630
Hey! Hey, take it easy, will ya? I
can't take it easy. I'm frustrated, okay?

12:54.707 --> 12:58.040
I've been tryin' to get answers all
day, and I can't get any from anybody.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.943
Okay, just a second.
I'm doin' the best I can, you know.

13:01.013 --> 13:06.815
Look. I'll go back and get Ziggy to
run a-a-a national cross-reference here,

13:06.886 --> 13:11.016
to try and find some personal data
on Abigail and her father, okay?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.854
And I'll be back as soon as I can.
Look, Al, I'm sorry.

13:13.926 --> 13:18.556
I didn't mean to come down
on you so hard. It's just-

13:18.631 --> 13:21.293
She's so fragile, you know, and
I just wouldn't want anything to-

13:21.367 --> 13:25.235
Okay, I understand. I understand.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

14:07.446 --> 14:10.108
Night, Daddy.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.381
<i>Now let's see.
What do we have in here?</i>

14:50.456 --> 14:52.390
<i>Sheriff's office.</i>

14:52.458 --> 14:54.392
<i>Ooh, ham and cheese.</i>

14:55.494 --> 15:01.455
You know, from my point of view, Bart didn't
look any better alive than he did dead.

15:01.533 --> 15:05.469
Well, I guess anybody that, uh,
drunk that m-m-m-much...

15:05.537 --> 15:10.065
was, uh, bound to waste away to nothing.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.303
That's-That's what my daddy says.

15:12.378 --> 15:16.508
Tell you, Will. I remember when Bart
was a model citizen in this town.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.517
<i>I thought he was gonna
run for mayor.</i>

15:24.857 --> 15:27.257
<i>Sure would.</i>

15:27.326 --> 15:31.092
You'd have to burn down the parish
and have Truman run against him.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.688
Eisenhower.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.496
Beg your pardon?

15:36.568 --> 15:41.596
Eisenhower...
was the president in '55.

15:43.008 --> 15:46.102
That's right.
Still is.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.476
That's why I figure it'd take
Truman to run against Travis,

15:48.547 --> 15:51.448
on the account of he's the one
that's out of a job right now.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.451
Oh, yeah.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.183
<i>Uh, L-Leta Aiderjust walked in.</i>

16:00.259 --> 16:02.591
Oh, Lord have mercy.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.563
I called her in Baton Rouge last night, and
she was this close to bein' a basket case.

16:10.069 --> 16:14.028
Mrs. Aider,
we're all terribly sorry.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.233
Where's my husband?
He's with the doctor.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.833
I just came from Doc Kinman's.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.709
<i>Doc's gotta check him out.
Now, you know that, Leta.</i>

16:21.780 --> 16:24.214
I want to see him, Clayton.

16:24.283 --> 16:27.343
Look, Leta, why-why don't
you and I go and, uh-

16:27.419 --> 16:30.513
Will, why don't you see if
your father's done with Mr. Aider.

16:30.589 --> 16:35.492
I don't care if he's finished or not,
I want to see... my husband.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.155
Would you like to sit down?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.865
I don't think it's such
a good idea right now.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.838
Doc's doin' an autopsy
to determine cause of death.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.175
Bo told me he fell and hit his head.
Or is that another Fuller lie?

16:53.245 --> 16:55.406
We don't know.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.109
Until we get a preliminary autopsy,
we won't know.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.617
Are you tellin' me his death
wasn't an accident?

17:00.686 --> 17:05.749
We're tryin' to find out if he drowned, had a heart attack
- Bart's heart was fine.

17:05.824 --> 17:11.228
Mrs. Aider, until I get a report, anything
I tell you right now would be speculation.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.291
Two years ago I lost my little girl,
and now the Lord has taken Bart.

17:17.368 --> 17:20.667
And none of this
makes sense to me.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.903
None of it.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.742
Now, I want to see my husband.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.617
Please.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.555
Uh, D-Daddy said, uh,
come on.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.239
You sure she's gonna be
all right up there? Leta?

18:29.308 --> 18:31.936
Oh, she's
the strongest woman I know.

18:32.010 --> 18:36.674
When her little girl disappeared, everyone
thought it would be Leta that'd fall apart.

18:36.748 --> 18:39.148
She stood steady as a rock.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.880
Bart crumbled like old china.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.821
He always thought it was
all his fault. His fault?

18:44.890 --> 18:48.155
They couldn't have any more kids
'cause of his prostate.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.320
It was a miracle
they had Violet.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.329
I don't understand.
How was that his fault?

18:54.466 --> 18:57.833
Seems how I remember, Bart felt
it made him feel less a man.

18:57.903 --> 19:02.237
So we talked a lot about it, and
I thought I got him turned around.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.775
Until Violet died.

19:04.843 --> 19:08.472
If only they'd have known
for sure what happened to her.

19:08.547 --> 19:14.076
But never having found that child's
body, never knowing for sure-

19:14.153 --> 19:16.087
Poor Violet.

19:16.155 --> 19:21.320
Next to your Abigail, she was the
prettiest little girl in this parish.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.691
Well, I-I don't need to
tell you that.

19:30.135 --> 19:34.367
Can I get you somethin'? A drink of water or
- No, I just need some air, thank you.

19:34.439 --> 19:37.033
I'd be happy to walk with you.
I'd rather be by myself.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.946
Sheriff, I know there are
some forms to fill out,

19:42.014 --> 19:45.381
but if you could just give me a few moments
- I'll be in my office all day.

19:45.450 --> 19:48.578
I don't need all day.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.588
I just need some air.

19:57.696 --> 20:01.257
Clayton, I-I need to have
a word with you.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.984
Ohh, no. Dead people.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.578
Oh, I don't like dead people.

20:23.655 --> 20:27.352
I don't need this. Nobody
needs a murder on their hands.

20:27.426 --> 20:32.090
Murder? Oh, is this the dead body that
wasn't a dead body when Abigail found him?

20:32.164 --> 20:35.691
What are you sayin'?
Bart Aider died of heart failure.

20:35.767 --> 20:40.761
But what I can't figure is whether this
happened before or after the heart attack.

20:40.839 --> 20:43.273
Are you sayin' this blow to the
head caused the heart attack?

20:43.342 --> 20:46.106
- Could be.
- We're back to the "somebody hit him" theory.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.272
Did you say you found an
old oar by the body? Yeah.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.579
<i>You didn't say anything to me about an
oar. Look at the shape of that bruise.</i>

20:52.651 --> 20:57.281
<i>Well, couldn't that bruise be caused by
fallin'and hittin' his head on a rock or somethin'?</i>

20:57.356 --> 21:00.450
A rock underneath the water?
Maybe.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.857
But if somebody hit him,
how come the skin isn't broken?

21:02.928 --> 21:07.331
Depends on how hard he was hit, uh, as to
whether the skin would be broken, right?

21:07.399 --> 21:10.334
That's right. But look
at his arm. Look there.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.461
What is this, Sherlock Holmes
or somethin'?

21:12.537 --> 21:15.529
You're-You're sayin' he had a heart
attack because someone attacked him?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.700
Well, I don't know.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.710
L- I think he had a heart attack,

21:19.778 --> 21:23.407
and then, when he was falling,
he tried catch himself or somethin'...

21:23.482 --> 21:25.609
and hit his arm,
and then he hit his head.

21:25.684 --> 21:28.710
<i>Yeah. Besides, you said that
no one was there except Abigail.</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:32.848
I'm just asking questions, Clayton.
I'm not accusing anybody.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.824
Is he sayin' what I think he's sayin'?

21:34.893 --> 21:37.521
Sounds like it.
Sounds like what?

21:38.664 --> 21:42.691
Sounds like I should think about
all of this a little more carefully.

21:42.768 --> 21:47.034
Look, all I'm sayin' is,
it's just a kind of weird coincidence...

21:47.105 --> 21:51.838
<i>that Abigail was the last person
to see Violet and Bart alive.</i>

21:51.910 --> 21:54.674
Sheriff, uh, Miss Aider's
all over your Abigail.

21:54.746 --> 21:57.476
You gotta come quick!

22:02.921 --> 22:06.084
<i>You stay away from her.! You
hear me? You stay away from her.!</i>

22:06.158 --> 22:08.820
She was there!
She said she was out there!

22:08.894 --> 22:11.362
Hey, everybody, let's just
calm down. Excuse me here.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.365
Let's just start at the beginning here, and
- Nobody called for a lawyer.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.333
Just tell me what happened.
What happened?

22:16.401 --> 22:19.768
I was workin' on the death papers. Abigail
walked in. She came back to your office.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.966
Next thing you know, she's screamin'
at the child like a wild banshee!

22:23.041 --> 22:27.102
She was smilin' that same evil smile
she had at the services for my Violet!

22:27.179 --> 22:29.238
I just said I was sorry
that he died.

22:29.314 --> 22:33.580
That's a lie! She said she was sorry that
he fell, but if he hadn't been as mad at her,

22:33.652 --> 22:35.415
<i>he wouldn't have fallen
and hit his head.</i>

22:35.487 --> 22:38.923
- She watched him die.
- Is that true, Abigail?

22:38.990 --> 22:41.015
You don't have to
answer him. I told you!

22:41.093 --> 22:44.756
No solicitin' in the sheriff's
office! Bo, the child has legal rights!

22:44.830 --> 22:46.798
Wait a second. My daughter
does not need a lawyer.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.357
He fell down and died! It's not my
fault, just like Violet's not my fault!

22:50.435 --> 22:52.699
She's lyin', just like she was
lyin' about my Violet.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.932
<i>- Can't anyone see that?
- Daddy, let's go on our picnic.</i>

22:55.006 --> 22:57.474
Can't you see her
for the devil that she is?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.476
Leta!
Can't you see?

22:59.544 --> 23:01.569
Come on, Doc. Come on, Doc.
Let's get her out.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.513
Everybody could use some air here.
Let's go. Come on.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.916
You okay, Abigail? I don't like
her. I don't like any of'em!

23:07.986 --> 23:11.114
<i>Not Violet, or her father, or-
I'm sorry, Sheriff. I just didn't know.</i>

23:11.189 --> 23:14.022
It's okay, Marie. Let's
go, Daddy. Please let's go.

23:14.092 --> 23:16.026
All right.
Sam, Sam. We gotta talk.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.028
L
- I just need to do one thing, okay? Okay.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.030
Can you wait for me out here?
Uh-huh.

23:20.098 --> 23:22.032
You'll be all right?
Uh-huh.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.432
Will
- All right. Come on, Abigail.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.063
The picnic basket's on Delta's desk.

23:27.139 --> 23:30.165
I'll be over to fix supper.
Sam.

23:38.650 --> 23:40.845
W- What are you lookin' for?

23:42.354 --> 23:44.754
The file on Violet Aider.

23:48.960 --> 23:53.829
<i>According to this, when Violet disappeared
the whole parish searched for her.</i>

23:53.899 --> 23:58.165
They gave up when they found a sweater-
her sweater- torn and covered with blood.

23:58.236 --> 24:02.605
They thought that a-a pack of wild dogs that
had been runnin' in the woods killed her.

24:02.674 --> 24:07.134
This says that they killed the pack of dogs,
and Clayton Fuller called off the investigation.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.181
Oh, this is- this is weird.
This is too weird.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.216
Do you have anything yet, Al?
Anything at all?

24:12.284 --> 24:16.687
Well, yeah, that's why I'm here. Uh, Ziggy
picked up an item in your hometown new-

24:16.755 --> 24:21.419
I mean, Clayton's hometown newspaper,
a place just south of Shreveport.

24:21.493 --> 24:24.519
It said that tomorrow
Clayton and his daughter-

24:24.596 --> 24:28.054
Burn to death in a fire at his home,

24:28.133 --> 24:31.068
and the cause of the fire
wasn't... determined.

24:34.139 --> 24:39.441
Al, do you think that Abigail,
a little girl like Abigail,

24:42.347 --> 24:44.508
could be capable of... murder?

25:01.666 --> 25:04.066
<i>Murder is, by nature,
an ugly word.</i>

25:04.135 --> 25:06.797
<i>But the thought that someone
as seemingly innocent as Abigail...</i>

25:06.872 --> 25:12.242
<i>might be capable of such a heinous act
had left me feeling very confused-</i>

25:12.310 --> 25:17.111
<i>Confused about the needs of a lonely child to
create her dead mother's vision in the night.</i>

25:17.182 --> 25:20.379
<i>But more than a vision-
There was a woman.</i>

25:20.452 --> 25:25.253
<i>I saw her. As insane as
it all seemed, I saw her.</i>

25:29.427 --> 25:31.895
Look at the flowers, Daddy.
Aren't they beautiful?

25:33.265 --> 25:35.756
And they smell just like-

25:37.969 --> 25:41.530
What's wrong?
They smell like my mommy.

25:45.844 --> 25:49.075
She shouldn't have gone away.
It wasn't my fault.

25:49.147 --> 25:53.208
Of course it wasn't your fault.
She said it was.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.777
Your mother would never
say that. But she did.

25:56.855 --> 26:00.814
She yelled at you for a long time
before she went away.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.390
Abigail,

26:04.462 --> 26:07.329
do you remember what Mama
yelled at me about?

26:09.401 --> 26:13.531
Could you tell me?
Because I can't remember, and...

26:13.605 --> 26:16.403
it would help me
make sense of everything.

26:21.780 --> 26:26.649
I remember the rain...
and lots of thunder.

26:27.652 --> 26:32.282
Mama and I liked the thunder because we
could pretend the dinosaurs were comin'.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.259
Do you like the rain, Daddy?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.295
Yes, I do.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.354
Mama would say
it'd make us all clean again.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.801
Oh, the thunder was so loud.
What?

26:44.869 --> 26:49.203
It was hard to hear,
but I heard Mama yellin'.

26:49.274 --> 26:53.210
About what?
You remember.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.542
No, Abigail.
I can't remember what she said.

26:55.614 --> 27:00.108
She said Violet lied.
Violet lied about what?

27:00.185 --> 27:05.714
Violet said Nana Lanchette was crazy...
and killed all her babies except Mama.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.226
Said Mama was crazy
and me too.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.319
She said when I had kids,
they'd be crazy too.

27:11.396 --> 27:14.365
Oh, no, no. You aren't.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.559
You're not crazy, Abigail.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.103
That's why I hit her.

27:22.273 --> 27:24.207
You hit Violet?

27:24.275 --> 27:27.506
She was teasing me
about the locket.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.173
<i>She said we were poor and crazy,
and I hit her.</i>

27:37.489 --> 27:39.457
<i>I hit her until my hand hurt.</i>

27:39.524 --> 27:42.425
<i>Her nose was bleeding all over
her new white sweater.</i>

27:42.494 --> 27:46.590
<i>She started to cry.
She said she was gonna tell her mama.</i>

27:46.665 --> 27:49.031
<i>Then she ran away.</i>

27:52.737 --> 27:54.671
No one ever saw her after that.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.934
Violet's death was not your fault,
Abigail. But I wanted her to die.

28:01.012 --> 28:05.176
Wanting someone dead and-and killing
them are two different things.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.844
You didn't kill Violet, Abigail.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.014
I wished Mr. Aider dead too.

28:14.592 --> 28:17.857
Did you hit Mr. Aider? He was
yellin' at me to give the locket back.

28:17.929 --> 28:21.592
Where is Violet's locket?
It's not Violet's. It's mine!

28:21.666 --> 28:26.035
Mommy and I were saving up
all our money to buy it, and Violet knew it.

28:26.104 --> 28:30.598
She bought your locket?
She did it just to be spiteful.

28:30.675 --> 28:33.701
Did you take the locket, Abigail?
I don't wanna talk about it anymore!

28:33.778 --> 28:35.712
Unless you tell me
what happened, I can't help.

28:35.780 --> 28:39.079
I didn't kill 'em!
I didn't kill either of'em!

28:42.887 --> 28:44.946
No one said you did.

28:45.023 --> 28:48.151
Mama said you'd keep me safe.
She swore on her heart.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.694
Safe from what?

28:50.762 --> 28:54.425
Daddy, tell me all the ways
that you love me.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.933
Please tell me.

29:22.827 --> 29:26.490
<i>I'm sorry. He's not available right now.
Can I have him get back to you?</i>

29:29.234 --> 29:31.998
Uh, Sheriff, can I get you to,
uh, s-sign these?

29:33.671 --> 29:36.105
<i>Okay. Yes, I'll make sure
he gets it.</i>

29:36.174 --> 29:40.838
Daddy says he's gonna have the coroner
from Sh-Sh-Shreveport come in...

29:40.912 --> 29:43.540
and do a full autopsy on M-Mr. Aider.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.742
Whatever he thinks is best.

29:47.085 --> 29:50.179
Um, is sh-
is she all right?

29:50.255 --> 29:53.053
Well, Mrs. Aider is goin' through a rough time
- No, not her.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.685
I, uh, m-m-meant Abigail.

29:56.761 --> 30:00.720
Well, Abigail is very upset.
But I thank you for askin'.

30:00.799 --> 30:06.032
L- I hate the way Miss Aider
t- t-talked to her.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.402
I hate those lies she's been sayin'.
What lies?

30:08.473 --> 30:12.967
All that stuff about M-M-Miss Fuller...

30:13.044 --> 30:15.171
and Abigail bein' crazy-

30:15.246 --> 30:20.343
crazy 'cause old Miss L-Lanchette
was crazy.

30:20.418 --> 30:23.285
Well, you know, those stories
have been around a long time, Will.

30:23.354 --> 30:26.255
Yeah, well,
long as I can remember.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.451
But you don't think they're true?

30:28.526 --> 30:33.463
W- Well, I wasn't around
when Miss Lanchette went, and, uh,

30:35.500 --> 30:39.436
Cut her own... throat.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.601
She slit her own throat?

30:46.678 --> 30:49.943
I mean, uh, sometimes
it's-it's hard for me to believe.

30:50.014 --> 30:54.383
I, um, I probably shouldn't be, uh,
t- talkin' to you about your family business.

30:54.452 --> 30:57.444
No, it's okay. Uh, look, I'm kinda curious
about what you heard.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.615
Why-Why don't you sit down, Will?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.852
Uh-
Go on. Sit down.

31:04.495 --> 31:09.398
Well, I, uh- I kn-kn-knew
old Mr. Devareux.

31:09.467 --> 31:11.401
He worked at
the hospital near Peach,

31:11.469 --> 31:13.801
and, uh, he said that he, uh,

31:13.872 --> 31:19.640
found all those children
with their... throats... c-cut open-

31:19.711 --> 31:22.111
all of'em except your wife.

31:26.317 --> 31:29.377
Laura's mother killed her children
and then herself.

31:29.454 --> 31:32.082
I know.

31:32.156 --> 31:35.592
Old Mr. Devareux s-said that...

31:35.660 --> 31:38.356
<i>Rhetta Lanchette lost her husband...</i>

31:38.429 --> 31:42.263
<i>and then lost all her m-m-money,</i>

31:42.333 --> 31:45.302
and then she lost her mind.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.699
<i>L- The story goes that, uh,</i>

31:50.775 --> 31:54.768
sh-sh-she said she'd, uh,
rather, uh- uh,

31:54.846 --> 31:57.076
kill her babies
than, uh, see 'em starve.

31:59.684 --> 32:03.814
So is that true?
All that, uh, s-s-stuff, I mean?

32:03.888 --> 32:05.822
That's what they say.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.456
Sheriff, you-you think what, uh,

32:10.528 --> 32:14.464
L- L-Leta Aider says about
that kind of craziness is true?

32:14.532 --> 32:18.263
About Abigail bein', uh, touched...

32:18.336 --> 32:21.669
because of her m-m-mama
and her grandmama?

32:21.739 --> 32:24.173
Emotional breakdowns
are not hereditary, Will.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.006
Leta Aider says that your wife
couldn't stand the truth-

32:27.078 --> 32:29.012
Abigail is not crazy, Will.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.140
L- I know, Sheriff.

32:34.719 --> 32:39.713
Uh, well, I'll-I'll t-take care
of this paperwork,

32:39.791 --> 32:42.988
and, uh, tell Mr. Takins to, uh,

32:43.061 --> 32:47.054
drive, uh, Bart Aider
on up to Shreveport.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.565
Sheriff?
Thank you, Will.

32:55.506 --> 32:58.475
Sam, Abigail
still gets killed tonight.

32:58.543 --> 33:00.943
She's not gonna get killed
tonight, Al,

33:01.012 --> 33:03.139
because she's not goin'
anywhere near our house, okay?

33:03.214 --> 33:05.478
She's spending the night at Marie's.
She's not gonna get killed.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.609
Okay, well, Ziggy has
somethin' else. What?

33:07.685 --> 33:12.748
Your, uh, wi-wife- Clayton's
wife, Laura, isn't dead.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.382
What?

33:14.459 --> 33:18.054
Yeah. She's in a private
asylum just off the Parish Road.

33:18.129 --> 33:21.223
It's called the Peach Hill,
uh, Home for the Mentally Ill.

33:21.299 --> 33:24.564
That's great, Al. She'll be
able to give us some answers!

33:24.635 --> 33:26.933
Yeah, if she's not too mentally ill.
Listen, Al,

33:27.005 --> 33:31.942
I need you to have Ziggy find out what happened
to Laura's family. The Lanchette family. Lanchette.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.274
What do you mean,
what happened to them?

33:34.345 --> 33:40.113
Well, except for Abigail's mother,
Laura, they w-were all murdered.

33:40.184 --> 33:44.177
By who?
Laura's mother, Rhetta Lanchette.

33:44.255 --> 33:47.747
And then she killed herself. Get
outta here! She killed her own kids?

33:47.825 --> 33:52.125
Yeah, she sl
- she slit their throats, and then she slit her own throat.

33:52.196 --> 33:55.131
This is too weird.

33:55.199 --> 34:00.102
Well, a-a-at least we know that Laura
survived this, because she's alive.

34:00.171 --> 34:03.368
It's no wonder
she's in the nuthouse.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.375
Yeah.

34:05.443 --> 34:09.038
- Where you goin'?
- To meet my wife.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.453
<i>Laura Fuller was alive.</i>

34:18.523 --> 34:22.516
<i>Now Abigail's story ofher mother's
departure began to make sense.</i>

34:22.592 --> 34:27.087
<i>Laura had been committed that night, leaving
her daughter and some dark secret behind-</i>

34:27.165 --> 34:29.565
<i>a secret that would set Abigail free.</i>

34:29.634 --> 34:32.159
<i>That's her, Al.</i>

34:33.170 --> 34:36.197
She's the woman I saw in the hall.
She's completely gone.

34:36.274 --> 34:39.971
You heard what the caretaker said.
She's been like this ever since you-

34:40.043 --> 34:43.036
I mean, Clayton-
brought her here two years ago.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.074
Hello, Laura.

34:51.054 --> 34:54.114
I need to talk to you.

34:55.560 --> 34:59.826
L
- I need you to tell me what happened the day that Violet disappeared.

35:06.237 --> 35:08.228
Please.

35:09.907 --> 35:14.435
If you tell me,
I can help your Abigail.

35:20.751 --> 35:25.950
I gotta find some way to unlock her mind,
right? So I can figure out what she knows.

35:26.023 --> 35:30.824
Well, maybe she doesn't know anything.
Maybe she's just seen too many bad things.

35:30.895 --> 35:32.886
She knows somethin', Al.

35:32.964 --> 35:37.025
I mean, she knows why Clayton
closed Violet's case, right?

35:37.101 --> 35:40.867
She's gotta know why Leta Aider
is so angry with Abigail.

35:40.938 --> 35:45.341
Well, we know that Leta thinks Abigail
killed her daughter and her husband.

35:47.278 --> 35:49.371
Wait a minute.

35:49.447 --> 35:53.747
Abigail told me that when she and Violet
were fighting that Violet called her crazy,

35:53.818 --> 35:59.654
and said that her mother, Leta Aider, said that she
shouldn't be allowed to live and have more crazy children.

35:59.724 --> 36:03.558
So it has to be Leta that starts the
fire and makes it look like an accident.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.994
In her twisted mind,
she thinks it's a community service.

36:06.063 --> 36:08.088
Check on Abigail, would you?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.327
Yeah, well, you said
she was with, uh-

36:10.401 --> 36:13.097
Just check on her.
All right.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.105
Oh, no.
What?

36:15.173 --> 36:19.075
Well, now Ziggy says that Abigail
still dies in the fire, and so will you.

36:19.143 --> 36:22.374
But Abigail's at Marie's house.
No, she's not. She's at your house.

36:22.446 --> 36:24.380
You better get there.
What?

36:24.448 --> 36:28.612
Uh, Gooshie,
center me on Abigail!

36:44.602 --> 36:46.536
Daddy?

36:49.807 --> 36:52.105
Daddy?

36:54.312 --> 36:56.246
Daddy?

37:03.788 --> 37:06.814
Where is he?
You said my Daddy was here.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.951
- I wanted to talk to you, Abigail.
- You told me he was hurt.

37:10.027 --> 37:12.655
I want you to tell me the truth.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.464
- Where's Marie?
- Marie's not coming, Abigail.

37:18.536 --> 37:21.266
You said
she was right behind us.

37:21.339 --> 37:24.502
I want my father! This time
it's just you and me, Abigail.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.601
No one to disturb us.

37:27.678 --> 37:31.170
No one to hear your lies
and see your perfect, little performance.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.582
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- I want the truth.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.644
I want Violet's locket.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.350
Daddy! They're all dead,
Violet and Bart, but not you.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.585
Let me go! Oh, not you.
Everybody thinks you're so sweet-

37:42.660 --> 37:44.594
Stop it! And so innocent,
but I know the truth.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.653
You killed my Violet,
and then you killed my Bart!

37:46.731 --> 37:48.756
No! I didn't kill 'em!
You had a fight with Violet.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.461
She said I was crazy.
So you killed her?

37:51.535 --> 37:54.766
No! No! You killed my only
daughter! What is this?

37:54.839 --> 37:58.206
I just wanted her to stop. You hit
her, and you hit her, and you hit her.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.801
Hey, hey, hey,
let her go, you witch!

38:00.878 --> 38:04.211
Her nose was bleeding. Yes, and she
tried to run away, but you grabbed her.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.443
Oh, no. And you tore that
sweater right off her back!

38:06.517 --> 38:08.451
No! I told you!
Sam, you better get here quick!

38:08.519 --> 38:12.455
She tried to run, but you grabbed her and you hit
her, and you kept on until she didn't move anymore!

38:12.523 --> 38:16.789
Stop it, stop it, stop!
Please, you're hurtin' me!

38:16.861 --> 38:19.329
Did Violet ask you to stop?
Did she beg you to stop?

38:19.397 --> 38:22.298
Let me go! Did my baby
cry out to you for mercy?

38:22.366 --> 38:24.493
Gooshie, center me on Sam!

38:24.568 --> 38:28.197
It was you who killed her,
Abigail! I didn't kill her!

38:38.616 --> 38:41.278
Sam, you gotta get there!
Leta's got Abigail.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.752
She's accusing her of killing
her daughter and her husband!

38:43.821 --> 38:45.755
She's gettin' violent!
How much time do I have?

38:45.823 --> 38:47.757
Uh, there's no way to know.
How much time-

38:47.825 --> 38:49.759
There's no record, Sam!
Until I get to the house?

38:49.827 --> 38:54.093
Uh, seven minutes and 13
seconds. Damn these back roads!

38:54.165 --> 38:56.463
Well, if you could fly
you'd be there by now.

38:56.534 --> 38:58.525
Just hurry up!
Go back to the house, Al.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.866
There's nothin' I can
do, Sam. Just be with her.

39:00.938 --> 39:03.702
Please, just be with her.

39:03.774 --> 39:05.708
Did you hide it upstairs?

39:05.776 --> 39:08.040
I told you. I don't have
her locket! You're lying!

39:08.112 --> 39:10.205
Don't you hit her! Bring
it to me, and I will know.

39:10.281 --> 39:14.547
Abigail, just say you're gonna give her the locket
even if you don't have it, just to get away!

39:14.618 --> 39:18.611
Yes. You can have it. Just
don't touch me. Don't hit me.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.453
Where is it?
It's upstairs in my treasure box.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.050
- Okay, now let her go!
- I knew it.

39:24.128 --> 39:27.063
Hurry up, Sam! It's up in
my room. I'll go and get it.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.065
All right. You go. Oh,
good, good. Now run!

39:29.133 --> 39:31.624
No! Show me.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.227
You take me up there,
and you show me where it is!

39:34.305 --> 39:36.296
Ow!

39:37.675 --> 39:40.075
All right!
Now go, Abigail, go!

39:53.858 --> 39:56.827
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.863
<i>Marie. Marie.
Sheriff, she's gone.! She's gone.!</i>

39:59.930 --> 40:04.492
I was makin' supper in the kitchen, and
there was somebody callin' at the front door-

40:04.568 --> 40:08.095
Ow! Ow! And Abigail was sitting
at the kitchen table,

40:08.172 --> 40:10.163
and there was nobody
at the front door,

40:10.241 --> 40:14.234
and when I came back Abigail was gone,
and the back door was bangin' open.

40:14.311 --> 40:17.405
Marie. Marie. You've got a broken
leg. But she's got to be around here.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.745
- I know she is!
- She's at my house.

40:19.817 --> 40:22.980
- No, she can't. She can't. Why?
- Marie, she's in terrible danger, Marie.

40:23.053 --> 40:25.385
- Well, you go to her!
- Marie, I can't leave you here.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.617
I don't know if I can come back
and get you.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.625
Put your arm around me.
I'm gonna lift you.

40:29.693 --> 40:33.459
Now you're gonna be in a lot of pain,
all right? Now just come on. Come on.

40:33.531 --> 40:36.989
<i>Hurry up, Abigail.
She's gonna be comin;</i>

40:37.067 --> 40:39.968
Good, Abigail.
Find someplace to hide.

40:41.705 --> 40:45.163
Come on! Find a place!
All right now. Be quiet.

40:45.242 --> 40:49.201
<i>Oh.! Oh, she's lit a candle or somethin;
She's gonna be comin'up.</i>

40:49.280 --> 40:51.214
<i>Quiet, Abigail.</i>

40:51.282 --> 40:53.375
Hurry up, hurry up.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.976
Don't come back this way.
She's-She's comin' up the stairs.

40:56.053 --> 40:59.819
Hurry up. Find a place to hide.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

41:02.126 --> 41:05.391
Yeah, oh, good, good!
That's a good place to hide!

41:05.463 --> 41:09.297
Okay, now don't make a peep,
Abigail. Not a peep!

41:12.603 --> 41:15.128
Sam, come on. Get here!

41:17.641 --> 41:20.041
Oh.

41:20.110 --> 41:22.135
Why don't you drop dead, lady?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.204
<i>Stay away from that.!</i>

41:30.888 --> 41:33.686
<i>What the hell is that?
Abigail.!</i>

41:35.893 --> 41:38.123
Sam, don't call her name!
She's hiding!

41:38.195 --> 41:41.358
Where is she? Uh, she's upstairs in the
cabinet, and Leta's right next to her!

41:41.432 --> 41:45.027
<i>No. No, get away.!
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all.!</i>

41:46.270 --> 41:48.329
<i>Daddy.!</i>

41:48.405 --> 41:51.203
<i>Hurry up!</i>

41:51.275 --> 41:56.338
- Abigail!
- Hurry up, Sam! Hurry up! She's in this thing right here, Sam!

41:56.413 --> 41:59.780
Abigail, he's coming!
Sam, come on, come on!

41:59.850 --> 42:03.342
Daddy! Daddy!

42:03.420 --> 42:05.445
<i>I'm comin'!
Daddy.!</i>

42:05.523 --> 42:08.219
Hang on! Hang on!

42:08.292 --> 42:11.386
<i>He's coming.! Hurry up.!
Come on. Move it, quick.!</i>

42:12.796 --> 42:15.287
Come on. It's okay.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.561
<i>Hurry up.!</i>

42:19.670 --> 42:23.197
<i>No, Sam, not that way.! Take her
out the window. Out the window.!</i>

42:27.645 --> 42:30.409
Daddy!
Daddy, hurry!

42:30.481 --> 42:34.383
It's jammed, Sam, break it! Take the chair
there and break it. Break it! Hurry up!

42:34.451 --> 42:36.385
Daddy!

42:40.891 --> 42:45.260
<i>Put her out on the roof!
She'll be all right on the roof out there. Okay.</i>

42:45.329 --> 42:48.821
<i>Oh, my God.!
Abigail's in there.!</i>

42:48.899 --> 42:51.493
Please, go! Help her!

42:51.569 --> 42:53.935
Careful! Careful!

42:54.004 --> 42:55.938
Daddy, no!
Get Daddy!

42:56.006 --> 42:58.440
He'll be right behind us.
He'll be okay, Abigail.

43:00.778 --> 43:04.111
<i>Go on out the window.! You too.!
Leta?</i>

43:04.181 --> 43:08.447
<i>No, it's okay.
She gets out the back way.!</i>

43:08.519 --> 43:12.114
Get out! Get out!
Hurry up!

43:12.189 --> 43:14.123
Sam, look out!

43:31.275 --> 43:33.675
I love you.

43:52.563 --> 43:55.123
You two rabbits
ought to be ashamed!

43:55.199 --> 43:58.635
<i>The weddin'is tomorrow.!
Now cover yourself.</i>

43:58.702 --> 44:03.230
And you, Will Kinman- If you
don't get outta here, I'm gonna-

44:03.307 --> 44:06.208
Well, I don't know
what I'm gonna do, but get out!

44:08.078 --> 44:10.706
Will K-Kinman?

44:12.983 --> 44:16.146
I couldn't wait one more moment
to touch you.

44:25.796 --> 44:28.924
<i>Now, you got five minutes to get dressed
and get out of this house,</i>

44:28.999 --> 44:31.092
<i>or I'm throwin'you out
buck naked.!</i>

44:31.168 --> 44:34.399
<i>You get him out ofhere.
You hear me, Abigail Fuller?</i>

44:37.307 --> 44:40.708
Abigail?

44:40.778 --> 44:43.747
Oh, b-boy.
