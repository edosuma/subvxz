00:21.600 --> 00:25.100
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>She's either counting oxygen molecules...</i>

00:25.100 --> 00:28.100
or analyzing the petri dish
she just put into her mouth.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.500
<i>Or sleeping.</i>
<i>I can never quite tell.</i>

00:30.500 --> 00:34.400
- You sure this is a good idea?
- We have plenty of petri dishes.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.900
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

00:35.900 --> 00:39.900
- You don't have to do this all yourself.
- Who else is there?

00:39.900 --> 00:42.100
We're running out of people.
We're getting no further with Gunn...

00:42.100 --> 00:45.200
I'm not leaving Gunn in a hell dimension.
We'll get him out.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.400
<i>In the meantime, I need you</i>
<i>to let us help you with her.</i>

00:50.400 --> 00:52.600
<i>- She's my responsibility.</i>
- She's our responsibility.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.300
If she's gonna be here, there are things
that we should be doing.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.500
Testing her powers, studying her.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.400
She put a whole petri dish
in her mouth?

01:02.400 --> 01:04.900
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>Illyria can be...</i>

01:04.900 --> 01:07.700
<i>diffiicult.</i>

01:07.700 --> 01:11.000
Testing her might be hard without
getting someone seriously hurt.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.700
- We'll make Spike do it.
- Good.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.500
She doesn't understand
our world.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.900
She needs someone to guide her.
She needs...

01:26.900 --> 01:28.500
When was the last time
you slept?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.900
You're not her savior.

01:32.900 --> 01:37.900
I need you here, working, not off drinking
yourself into a coma, chasing ghosts.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.500
Fred's dead, Wes.
You're still alive.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.000
Start acting like it.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.900
We didn't know where else to go.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.700
Our son was
getting the mail.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.700
We could see him
from the living room.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.000
He was walking across the driveway,
and this van...

02:06.000 --> 02:09.400
It must've been goin' 50,
60 miles an hour.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.700
It hopped the curb,
and it ran right into him.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.600
<i>It slammed him right into</i>
<i>the side of the garage...</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:17.900
<i>and then...</i>
<i>backed up and sped off.</i>

02:19.100 --> 02:21.900
And the police think
this was intentional.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.400
- Has Homicide found the van?
- You don't understand.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.000
Our son's not dead.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.300
- He's not?
<i>- [Man] No.</i>

02:29.300 --> 02:33.700
- He's fine. The van hit him, and he got right up.
- He hardly has a scratch on him.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.600
<i>Police said it was dumb luck.</i>
<i>But if you saw it...</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:40.600
One of the officers called us later,
said our son might be different.

02:40.600 --> 02:45.500
<i>He mentioned that there was a law firm in</i>
<i>Los Angeles that dealt with... things like this.</i>

02:45.500 --> 02:48.100
Harmony, would you ask Angel
to come in here, please?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.500
Our son's downstairs. He thinks
that we're here to set up a trust.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.100
We didn't know
what else to tell him.

02:56.100 --> 03:01.100
- Please, will you help us?
- Of course.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.400
<i>[Connor]</i>
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

04:08.800 --> 04:10.700
What...

04:10.700 --> 04:13.200
- What are you...
- Dad?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.800
<i>Yeah, it's okay.</i>
<i>Come on over.</i>

04:18.700 --> 04:21.399
You know, they have dried scorpions
in the vending machines downstairs.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.300
Angel, good. This is Laurence
and Colleen Reilly...

04:24.300 --> 04:26.200
- and this is their son...
- Connor. Hi.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.700
- Nice to meet you.
<i>- The Reillys need to talk about some issues...</i>

04:28.700 --> 04:31.200
<i>- regarding Connor here,</i>
<i>and I thought we could...</i>
- No.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.200
- What?
- I'm sorry.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.100
There must be some mistake.
We can't help you.

04:40.900 --> 04:45.900
A van ran him down.
He got up and walked away... unharmed.

04:45.900 --> 04:49.100
- How did they find us?
<i>- Apolice offiicer mentioned our name.</i>

04:49.100 --> 04:51.500
Said we might
be able to help.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.100
- We're not taking this case.
- Why not?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.100
Because with everything
goin' on, we don't have time...

04:59.100 --> 05:01.100
to be dealing with
small stuff like this.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.900
"Small stuff'? This is what we do.
Or what we're supposed to do.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.900
They need help.
They seem like good people.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.000
All the more reason
to get 'em out of here.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
We know what this place
does to good people.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.100
[Screams]

05:46.500 --> 05:49.200
What was it?

05:49.200 --> 05:52.800
What am l...
I was lookin' for somethin'.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.500
[Loudly]
It's okay.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.400
Found it.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.700
<i>- [Punch Lands]</i>
- [Groans]

06:09.700 --> 06:12.200
You break so easily.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.000
Why do you bother
getting back up?

06:17.200 --> 06:20.500
Right. We need to set
some ground rules.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
First off, no more
punching me in the face.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.400
Secondly, when I
punch you in the face...

06:25.400 --> 06:27.300
you tell me how you feel...

06:27.300 --> 06:29.500
so I can write that down
on my clipboard.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.600
Third, no touchin'
my clipboard. Fourth...

06:33.600 --> 06:36.800
- I enjoy hurting you.
- We're gonna have to fix that, 'cause I'm...

06:45.600 --> 06:46.800
<i>[Spike Groaning]</i>

06:49.000 --> 06:51.900
- How goes it?
<i>- I've been hitting the half-breed.</i>

06:51.900 --> 06:53.600
He makes noise.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.100
We're off to a bit
of a rough start.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.300
But don't worry.
I'll break her.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.700
She's not a horse, Spike.

07:01.700 --> 07:05.700
<i>You know, this room is equipped</i>
<i>with automated training devices.</i>

07:05.700 --> 07:09.400
<i>You don't have to test her</i>
<i>byjust allowing her to pummel you.</i>

07:09.400 --> 07:12.700
We're workin' on the basics.
But don't worry. I'm writing it all down.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.000
Okay, fine.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.900
You reek of frustration.
Curls off of you like smoke.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.200
Actually, luv, we call that scotch.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.100
Twelve-year Lagavulin,
if I'm not mistaken.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.200
<i>Good choice.</i>

07:25.200 --> 07:27.100
It's nothing.
I'm just, uh...

07:27.100 --> 07:30.300
I had a slight disagreement
with Angel.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.900
<i>Oh, old broody pants</i>
<i>got you wound up, eh?</i>

07:32.900 --> 07:36.200
<i>Keep in mind he can't get laid</i>
<i>without maybe goin'crazy.</i>

07:36.200 --> 07:38.100
- It makes it funny.
- In my time...

07:38.100 --> 07:40.000
a leader would punish
your insolence with death.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
- We're not being insolent, Illyria.
- I am.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.400
It's just, uh, I don't
always understand Angel.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.300
Yet you
follow him willingly.

07:50.300 --> 07:54.900
- You're loyal to him.
- He's earned it.

07:54.900 --> 07:59.700
<i>- I trust he knows what he's doing.</i>
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>

07:59.700 --> 08:04.300
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Angel? I'm at your disposal.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.900
My son walks in
through my door!

08:05.900 --> 08:08.200
And you make him walk right out again.
I found that interesting.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.400
I want him as far away
from here as possible.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.000
Yes. It might have been smart to
get some information out of him first.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.400
- It could help us understand what's happening.
<i>- I'll tell you what.</i>

08:16.400 --> 08:18.400
Why don't you just tell me?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
Let's be clear about this.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.400
Things run differently now.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.600
I'm not a little girl,
and you and I...

08:24.600 --> 08:26.600
won't be making love
on this couch anytime soon.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.400
And with that in mind,
how can I help you?

08:35.900 --> 08:38.299
The senior partners
and I had a deal.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.500
<i>Yes, you did.</i>
<i>They took your son...</i>

08:40.500 --> 08:43.000
your raging,
psychopathic son...

08:43.000 --> 08:45.200
gave him a new family,
changed his memories...

08:45.200 --> 08:47.300
changed everyone's memories,
actually...

08:47.300 --> 08:50.100
<i>in order to give him a new life,</i>
<i>a normal life.</i>

08:50.100 --> 08:52.500
- And I came to work here.
<i>- And we couldn't be happier.</i>

08:52.500 --> 08:54.900
The senior partners
honor their deals.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.500
<i>And believe me,</i>
<i>they have no desire to upset...</i>

08:57.500 --> 09:00.900
<i>such a profitable partnership.</i>

09:02.100 --> 09:07.200
So this is just a...
an unfortunate coincidence.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.600
<i>Oh, no, I didn't say that.</i>
<i>I said the senior partners...</i>

09:09.600 --> 09:11.500
weren't behind it.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.800
This isn't an accident.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.000
Someone out there's
trying to send you a message...

09:17.000 --> 09:18.800
and they're using
your son to do it.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.600
Where are we
supposed to go now?

09:29.400 --> 09:33.700
I'm sure there's someone else
who can, uh, handle our trust.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.900
Um, just so you know, you guys
don't have to keep pretending.

09:40.900 --> 09:44.200
- I know we were there because of the van thing.
- Oh.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.200
- I'm sorry, honey. It's just... It was...
- It's cool.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.700
My parents are liars, and I can never
trust them again, but it's cool.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.000
Look, I know
you guys are worried...

09:54.000 --> 09:57.800
but the whole point
is I'm okay.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.600
I got hit, and I'm okay.
That should make you happy...

09:59.600 --> 10:02.600
not like, you know,
mental patients.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.300
I mean, it turned out fine.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.500
[Mr. Reilly]
It's the getting-hit part.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.400
We thought you were dead.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.600
- [Connor] Hey, have some faith in me.
- Connor...

10:13.600 --> 10:17.200
<i>[Connor]</i>
<i>All right. Look, you guys.</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:20.100
I'm not saying
this isn't weird and all.

10:20.100 --> 10:23.200
But we'll get through it.
You don't have to be scared.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.700
- [Mrs. Reilly Screaming]
- [Mr. Reilly Shouting]

10:32.900 --> 10:34.800
<i>[Mr. Reilly]</i>
<i>Get off...</i>

10:34.800 --> 10:36.700
- Hey!
- [Screaming Continues]

10:36.700 --> 10:39.100
Mom!

10:42.300 --> 10:44.400
<i>[Mrs. Reilly Sobbing]</i>

10:44.400 --> 10:46.000
Whoa.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.700
[Growling]

11:16.000 --> 11:19.700
- Oh, my God!
- Connor, listen to me.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.600
You almost broke
that guy in half.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.600
That was awesome!

11:29.700 --> 11:32.200
Seriously, that was the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.600
Well, it's not a big deal.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.700
I mean, I do stuff like that a lot.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.700
- There was this one time in France...
<i>- [Mrs. Reilly] Connor.!</i>

11:39.700 --> 11:43.300
Dad. Dad.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.200
- I'm okay.
- We need to get him to a hospital.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.100
<i>We got doctors at Wolfram and Hart.</i>
<i>We can help.</i>

11:48.100 --> 11:51.200
And you and I have some things
we should probably talk about.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.900
Yeah, I kind of figured.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.700
Your dad's gonna be fine.
He's in good hands.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.700
Or claws, as the case may be.
They're good doctors.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.800
What were those things
that attacked us?

12:05.800 --> 12:08.500
Some kind of demon.
We're lookin' into it.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.800
Is that what I am?
Some kind of demon?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.800
- No.
- Then what am I?

12:16.800 --> 12:21.700
The best we can tell, you're a healthy,
well-adjusted kid...

12:21.700 --> 12:25.000
with, uh,
enhanced abilities.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.100
And you're a vampire.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.400
So, demons, vampires,
doctors with claws...

12:33.400 --> 12:37.000
and I'm some sort
of superhero.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.200
Okay.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.200
You're taking this
pretty well.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.400
What am I supposed to do,
complain?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.500
I just don't know how
I'm gonna explain it to my parents.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.000
You got family?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.900
- No.
- Right. Vampire.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.500
So, what are you,
like, 500 years old?

12:56.500 --> 12:59.600
No, I'm, uh...
Do I look 500?

12:59.600 --> 13:02.200
Do you spend all your time
making out with other vampires...

13:02.200 --> 13:04.100
like in Anne Rice novels?

13:04.100 --> 13:07.900
No. Well, I used to, but...

13:08.200 --> 13:10.700
- You have a girlfriend at least?
- I can't afford to.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.200
- Must be lonely.
- I keep busy.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.700
<i>Right. So, you guys,</i>
<i>like, fight crime...</i>

13:16.700 --> 13:18.800
and save the world here,
that sort of stuff?

13:18.800 --> 13:21.300
- Well, that's the idea.
- Wow.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.000
Is everyone here a superhero?
This place must be insane.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.600
It's mostly paralegals and secretaries.
Pretty boring, really.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.700
You filthy harlot!

13:32.700 --> 13:34.900
I'm gonna tear your neck out!

13:38.300 --> 13:40.900
- You wanna meet some of my coworkers?
<i>- [Blows Landing]</i>

13:40.900 --> 13:42.700
Okay.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.300
[Grunting]

13:50.800 --> 13:52.600
Guys, you wanna come here
for a second?

13:53.800 --> 13:57.100
- What is she?
- She's a... um, a...

13:57.100 --> 13:59.000
Well, to be honest,
I really don't know.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.800
- She's some sort of ancient demon.
- She have any powers?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.800
Glad you asked.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.600
So far, I've established
that she can hit like a Mack truck...

14:06.600 --> 14:08.600
selectively alter the flow of time...

14:08.600 --> 14:11.900
<i>and, uh, possibly</i>
<i>talk to plants.</i>

14:11.900 --> 14:13.900
I'd like to keep Spike
as my pet.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.400
Connor, this is Spike
and Illyria.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.800
- Guys, this is Connor.
- Hi.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.400
Um, I like your outfit.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.000
Your body warms.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.800
This one is
lusting after me.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.600
Oh, no. L...

14:33.600 --> 14:37.900
<i>It's... It's just, uh...</i>
<i>It's the outfit.</i>

14:37.900 --> 14:39.900
I guess I've always had
a thing for older women.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.600
- They were supposed to fix that.
- What?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.700
Nothing. Connor has
brought us a case.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.200
We're looking into it.
Just showin' him around.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.600
Hey, you kids, uh, playin'
with the training room?

14:50.600 --> 14:54.500
Whoa! Man, this place is
way better than college.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.100
Ange-babe, uh, Wes is requesting
your presence upstairs.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.900
Has a little demon info
for your peepers.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.200
- It's nice meeting you.
- You're in college?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.100
- Yeah.
- Where at?

15:06.100 --> 15:09.300
- Stanford.
- Really?

15:09.300 --> 15:12.700
<i>- [Angel] That's them.</i>
- Kith'harn demons.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.600
In Los Angeles,
they're the known henchmen...

15:14.600 --> 15:18.000
of a warlock called Cyvus Vail.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.100
- What do we know about him?
- He's powerful. Heads up a large demon empire.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.900
- Has tendrils stretching throughout L.A.
- "Tendril" tendrils?

15:23.900 --> 15:26.200
- Metaphor tendrils.
- What does he want with me?

15:26.200 --> 15:29.600
<i>Lfhe's using his Kith'harn demons,</i>
<i>he's not trying to remain anonymous.</i>

15:29.600 --> 15:31.900
- Where are you going?
- To go visit Mr. Vail.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.600
- I'll come with.
- No. You're here.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.700
We know hardly anything about this man.
If he's trying to bait you...

15:36.700 --> 15:38.700
- It's not up for discussion.
- At least take backup.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.800
I said I'd take care of it, Wes!
Drop it.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.800
Get me everything you can find
on Cyvus Vail.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.000
[Air Hissing]

16:16.100 --> 16:19.600
- [Equipment Squeaking]
- [Hissing Intensifies]

16:27.800 --> 16:29.600
[Labored Breath]

16:40.500 --> 16:43.000
Did you kill
all of my guards?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.100
- All the ones I could find.
<i>- Mmm.</i>

16:45.100 --> 16:48.000
I should have given them
the day off. Mmm.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.700
I wasn't trying
to kill your son, you know.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.600
I simply needed him
to understand...

17:03.600 --> 17:05.700
what he is capable of.

17:05.700 --> 17:09.400
- How do you know about Connor?
- I built him.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.800
These are everything
the clerk had on Vail.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.599
And <i>this</i> was down wandering
around Human Resources.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.900
- Spike is resting.
- Thank you, Harmony.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.500
<i>Here we go. Vail listings</i>
<i>under "accounts paid."</i>

17:34.500 --> 17:37.200
- Wolfram and Hart did business with him?
<i>- Yeah, it looks like...</i>

17:37.200 --> 17:40.400
he was one of their go-to warlocks
when it came to the magical mojo.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.800
<i>He specialized in</i>
<i>memory restructuring...</i>

17:42.800 --> 17:45.100
<i>mind control,</i>
<i>temporal shifts.</i>

17:46.100 --> 17:49.300
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

17:51.200 --> 17:53.900
You could buy Bolivia for
what we paid him on this one.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.800
Not just him.
He supervised some of...

17:57.800 --> 17:59.800
the most powerful sorcerers
on the West Coast.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.100
With manpower like that,
I'm guessin' he wasn't doin' card tricks.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.300
Some sort of reality shift, and it...

18:06.300 --> 18:08.500
Huh.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.700
What?

18:11.500 --> 18:14.800
It happened on the day
we took over Wolfram and Hart.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.400
Could you help me up?
I'd have one of my guards do it, but...

18:18.400 --> 18:21.200
[Labored Breathing]
Well, you know.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.300
Thank you.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.000
[Gasps]

18:26.000 --> 18:30.500
When Connor was five,
he got lost in a department store.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.900
[Gasps]

18:31.900 --> 18:35.400
He wandered off while
his family was shopping.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.100
It scared the poor child
nearly half to death.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.700
- That never happened!
- Yes.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.500
But he remembers
it happening.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.800
[Labored Breathing Continues]

18:51.500 --> 18:56.000
He remembers screaming
in the middle of the store.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.300
<i>He remembers his mother</i>
<i>rushing towards him...</i>

19:00.300 --> 19:03.600
and he remembers his father...

19:03.600 --> 19:06.500
sweeping him up into his arms.

19:07.700 --> 19:13.300
- You built his memories.
- I did. [Sighs]

19:13.300 --> 19:17.300
He is some of my finest work.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.500
- What do you want?
- I need someone dead...

19:21.500 --> 19:25.000
a demon... named Sahjhan.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.900
Sahjhan.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.700
I believe you
tussled with him before.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.400
He's a nasty little cur.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.100
He's gone.
I trapped him in a bottle.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.300
An urn, actually.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.000
It's a morbid thing.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.100
It doesn't really go
with my decor.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.000
He's trapped.
Let him rot.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.700
Urns tend to break.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.800
Long-lost enemies
tend to return.

19:58.800 --> 20:03.200
<i>I need finality to my affairs.</i>

20:08.800 --> 20:12.000
Do you know what
an Orlon Window is, Angel?

20:12.900 --> 20:15.500
It's a fascinating
little spell.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.500
<i>It allows warlocks</i>
<i>such as myself...</i>

20:18.500 --> 20:21.400
to see the past
as it once was.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.800
You have to be careful
with it though.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.200
If it were to break around someone
whose mind had been altered...

20:27.200 --> 20:31.100
then all his old memories
would come rushing back.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.800
Careful, Angel.

20:34.500 --> 20:39.000
<i>I gave Connor his happy life.</i>

20:39.000 --> 20:42.200
Are you certain
you can kill me...

20:42.200 --> 20:45.100
<i>before I can</i>
<i>take it away from him?</i>

20:48.200 --> 20:51.900
I... built your son.

20:51.900 --> 20:55.400
I am not the sort of man
you want as an enemy.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.700
[Grunts]

21:05.100 --> 21:08.300
Fine. I'll do it.
I'll kill Sahjhan.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.900
If it were that simple,
I'd do it myself.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.900
<i>No, the prophecy is quite clear.</i>

21:14.900 --> 21:18.500
There is only one person
who can kill Sahjhan.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.700
Connor.

21:21.700 --> 21:25.500
So, you see our problem.

21:25.800 --> 21:31.400
<i>I turned your son</i>
<i>into a healthy boy...</i>

21:31.400 --> 21:34.800
and now I need you...

21:34.800 --> 21:37.300
to turn him back into a killer.

21:44.700 --> 21:49.500
- He wants me to kill somebody?
- A demon... named Sahjhan.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.600
- I fought him before.
- Why me?

21:51.600 --> 21:54.200
- Why do I have to do it?
- Because you're special.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.300
There's a prophecy that says
you're the only one who can kill him.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.300
Why are we even entertaining this?

21:59.300 --> 22:01.300
Vail's made some convincing threats.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.200
Since when do we give in to threats?

22:03.200 --> 22:05.500
<i>He's not threatening you.</i>
<i>He's threatening my family.</i>

22:05.500 --> 22:08.100
We can't trust anything from Vail.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.900
He did a massive spell the day
we took over Wolfram and Hart.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.100
<i>- Until we understand why...</i>
- Is he pretty strong?

22:13.100 --> 22:15.500
- This Sahjhan?
<i>- That's a bit of an understatement.</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:17.600
Last time you fought him,
Sahjhan nearly killed you.

22:19.100 --> 22:23.900
- Is that true?
- This is different.

22:23.900 --> 22:27.000
Like I said, you're special.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.000
- We don't have a choice, do we?
<i>- [Wesley] Of course we have a choice.</i>

22:33.000 --> 22:35.400
<i>Wejust need time</i>
<i>to figure out what Vail did.</i>

22:35.400 --> 22:37.600
We don't have time.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.200
If I kill Sahjhan,
Vail will leave my family alone?

22:51.100 --> 22:53.300
What are we waitin' for?

23:01.400 --> 23:04.500
<i>[Gunn]</i>
<i>Please.! [Coughing]</i>

23:04.500 --> 23:07.800
<i>Please.! Please.!</i>
<i>I'll do whatever you say. Please.!</i>

23:07.800 --> 23:12.200
No! No! No!

23:12.200 --> 23:14.800
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

23:14.800 --> 23:16.900
Um, I'll just need a minute.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
[Shouts]

23:32.800 --> 23:35.000
Do you know
what this thing is?

23:36.800 --> 23:40.800
It's a gibbet.
Has he put you in it yet?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.000
He'll get around to it.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.300
Eventually, he gets around
to everything down here.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.200
Mr. Gunn,
I'm Marcus Hamilton...

23:50.200 --> 23:52.400
your new liaison
to the senior partners.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.900
I have a proposition
for you.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.800
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

23:58.500 --> 24:03.100
It occurs to us that you
might want to get out of here.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.200
- We can help with that.
- [Chuckling]

24:07.600 --> 24:11.300
You know, I've been by your offices,
seen your friends.

24:11.300 --> 24:15.900
Strange, there's not much activity
on the "Rescue Gunn" front.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.000
We're not asking you for much.
All we need you to do...

24:21.000 --> 24:23.200
Can I have my necklace back?

24:26.400 --> 24:28.500
Come on, Sparky. Let's go.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.700
This heart ain't
gonna cut itself out.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.600
Thank you for your time.

24:40.700 --> 24:43.700
<i>- No, no, no.! Please.! Please.! No.!</i>
<i>- [Flesh Tearing]</i>

24:43.700 --> 24:46.100
<i>[Screaming]</i>
<i>No.!</i>

24:46.100 --> 24:49.000
<i>You're not alone in this.</i>
<i>I'll be right there with you.</i>

24:49.000 --> 24:51.300
You're gonna hold Sahjhan down
while I stab him?

24:51.300 --> 24:54.300
The prophecy doesn't say
you can't have a little help.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.000
- That hardly seems fair.
- Fair's not something we worry about.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.800
Maybe you should.
I'm not a bully.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.900
If I'm gonna do this,
you gotta let me do it my way.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.500
Now I just gotta figure out
what my way is.

25:07.500 --> 25:11.400
- You'll have your whole life for that.
- Might as well start now.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.600
All right.
Let me show you a few things.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.500
Well, yeah.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.600
I'm all noble and stuff,
but I'm not an idiot.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.200
I've been in one fight in my entire life,
and you bailed me out of it.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.700
<i>Should I take one of these with me?</i>
<i>An ax or whatever this thing is.</i>

25:28.600 --> 25:30.700
- Sorry.
<i>- That's okay.</i>

25:30.700 --> 25:33.200
Probably, uh, stay away
from the weapons for now.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.000
- Okay. Sorry.
- All right, look.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.100
You're faster than Sahjhan.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.700
Use it.
He talks a lot.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.100
He'll try to lull you into slowing down.
Don't listen.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.400
Hit him quick.
Keep moving.

25:46.900 --> 25:49.200
Do you really think
I can do this?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.500
I know you can.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.000
You are so concerned
with names, dates, times.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Reality's been changed.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.900
Define "change."

26:01.900 --> 26:05.400
<i>- The world is as it is.</i>
- Not necessarily.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.100
You are a summation
of recollections.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.100
Each change is simply
a point of experience.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.100
We are more
than just memories.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.800
And yet Fred changed
the moment her memory did.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.700
- Fred's memories were changed?
- In places.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.500
Can you see
what they were before?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.700
No. They're gone.

26:34.100 --> 26:36.200
Does this change
your view of Fred?

26:36.200 --> 26:38.600
Is she still the person
you thought she was?

26:42.400 --> 26:44.200
No.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.300
None of us are.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.000
This place smells like
a retirement home.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.200
<i>Welcome.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

27:03.200 --> 27:05.500
- Oh, Lord, look at him.
- Shh!

27:05.500 --> 27:08.400
Listen, Vail,
we won't be staying long.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.400
Here's how it works.
I kill this Sahjhan thing, and we walk.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.600
You come near my family again,
and I'll slit your throat.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.500
And if that doesn't kill you,
I'll chop your whole head off.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.700
And if that doesn't work, I'll...

27:19.700 --> 27:23.000
I'll just keep stabbing you till you...
till you bleed to death.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.200
<i>- Understand?</i>
- I do.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.300
Good.

27:29.300 --> 27:33.100
- So, where is he?
- Right through there.

27:36.900 --> 27:38.900
Okay.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.700
- See you later.
- Wait. Listen. He's gonna talk to you.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.700
- Don't let him distract you.
- I won't.

27:45.700 --> 27:48.100
- Even if he's on the ground,
do not take your eyes off him.
- Okay.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.800
- Whatever you do, do not...
- Dude, you're startin' to freak me out.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.800
Right. Sorry.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.600
Oh.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.700
Sorry. Go get him.

27:59.900 --> 28:02.300
I'll be right over here.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.900
What am I suppo...

28:15.800 --> 28:17.600
Okay.

28:17.600 --> 28:21.600
<i>- He can't see us anymore.</i>
- Why not?

28:21.600 --> 28:24.500
I can't risk
Sahjhan getting loose.

28:26.100 --> 28:29.100
He has a nasty habit
of trying to kill me.

28:29.100 --> 28:34.700
<i>But don't worry.</i>
<i>Your boy is very brave.</i>

28:37.200 --> 28:40.400
I'm sure he'll do you proud.

28:43.300 --> 28:46.300
[Sighs]

28:46.300 --> 28:48.400
Open sesame, or whatever.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.400
[Chuckles]

29:10.400 --> 29:12.800
Thank you, mortal...

29:12.800 --> 29:15.800
for releasing me
from my cursed prison.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.000
In gratitude,
I grant you three wishes.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.400
- Really?
- Nah, I'm just messin' with you.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.100
- Oh.
- [Chuckling]

29:26.100 --> 29:29.200
I do appreciate it though.
[Grunts]

29:29.200 --> 29:33.200
- That urn wasn't exactly a day at the spa.
- [Bones Crack]

29:33.400 --> 29:36.200
- I owe you one.
- Right.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.900
Well, before you
start trying to kiss me...

29:39.900 --> 29:42.400
I should probably tell you,
you and I...

29:42.400 --> 29:46.300
we're, uh...
we're supposed to fight.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.500
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.800
Now, why would you want...

29:54.800 --> 29:56.600
Ah.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.900
- You're him.
- Yeah. I'm me.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.100
Hi.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.000
You can take a moment
if you want.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.900
There's some weapons and stuff
over here if you think you'll need 'em.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.600
- Thanks.
- He's talkin' to him.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.000
Why is he talkin' to him?
I told him not to talk to him.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.400
Been a while since
we've seen each other.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.100
How'd Quor'toth
work out for you anyway?

30:21.100 --> 30:24.300
Uh, worked out great.
Thanks for askin'.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.700
You know, I've had a long time
to plan for this moment.

30:29.400 --> 30:34.200
I figured you'd be
a lot more... intimidating.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.000
Yeah. Well, I figured...

30:37.000 --> 30:40.800
I was going to Tony Roma's
with my folks tonight, but I'm here.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.600
- Learn to cope.
- I'll work on it.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.200
Sorry. Not your fight.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.000
<i>[Connor Groans]</i>

30:56.200 --> 30:58.800
Ow! God, that really hurt.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.600
- Did it?
- Yeah.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.200
I'm sorry. Do you need
to call a time-out?

31:03.200 --> 31:05.100
No, I'm all right.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.500
Open the doorway right now.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
Or you'll what? Relax.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.400
Your son has to grow up
sooner or later.

31:17.400 --> 31:21.300
Sit back and watch
his future unfold.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.900
There's no need to bring back
the past if we don't have to.

31:43.400 --> 31:47.100
You know, I went to a lot
of trouble to get rid of you.

31:47.100 --> 31:50.800
What a colossal waste of time
that turned out to be.

31:55.900 --> 31:57.300
Open it now...

32:00.600 --> 32:02.800
<i>[Wes]</i>
<i>You changed the world.</i>

32:09.400 --> 32:11.700
Wes, what are you doin'?

32:11.700 --> 32:16.100
- You sold us out to Wolfram and Hart.
- Be careful.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.600
Is this your 30 pieces
of silver?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.400
Wes, give me that.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.200
He doesn't follow you
any longer.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.200
These prophecies are turning out
to be pretty overrated.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.100
I've gotta tell you, kid.
You're making a good case...

32:43.100 --> 32:46.300
for the whole concept
of free will.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.300
You changed the world.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.600
He's my son, Wesley.
Connor's my son.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.300
Did you trade her?

33:01.100 --> 33:04.000
- Did you trade Fred for your son?
- What?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.600
Everything that's happened since
we took over Wolfram and Hart...

33:06.600 --> 33:10.600
everything that's
happened to... her...

33:12.700 --> 33:16.200
Did you know?
Was Fred the price?

33:16.200 --> 33:20.600
No. Wes, I can explain.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.400
- Just put that down.
- Why are you so afraid of this?

33:24.800 --> 33:26.700
He said it would
bring back the past.

33:26.700 --> 33:31.000
- Would it undo what you've done?
- No.

33:33.600 --> 33:38.100
- It won't bring her back.
- Let's find out.

33:38.100 --> 33:43.000
No! Please.
You have to trust me.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.800
I can't. Not anymore.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.000
[Crying]

34:14.699 --> 34:17.100
[Gasps]

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
Connor.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.400
Lucky shot.

35:11.900 --> 35:14.200
Connor?

35:15.500 --> 35:18.600
Whoa. You see that?

35:18.600 --> 35:21.300
I went a little hard core
there for a second.

35:21.300 --> 35:24.100
That guy made me
really cranky.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.400
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.900
I guess.

35:32.900 --> 35:36.500
I don't really like people
touching my neck, you know?

35:37.900 --> 35:40.500
Connor, uh...

35:40.500 --> 35:42.300
Hey...

35:42.300 --> 35:46.300
can we... get outta here?

35:46.500 --> 35:51.100
I'd like to go back,
see my parents.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.500
This whole fighting thing...
I'm not...

35:58.500 --> 36:00.600
I'm not really sure
it's for me.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.500
<i>[Illyria]</i>
<i>You betrayed Angel.</i>

36:18.600 --> 36:20.500
You stole his son.

36:21.500 --> 36:23.300
He tried to kill you.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.900
Yes.

36:27.900 --> 36:30.400
Are these the memories
you needed back?

36:32.300 --> 36:34.600
Does this now
make you Wesley?

36:39.300 --> 36:41.300
At least I know
what happened.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.100
Do you?

36:44.500 --> 36:47.700
There are two sets
of memories...

36:47.700 --> 36:50.300
those that happened
and those that are fabricated.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.500
It's hard to tell
which is which.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.700
Try to push reality
out of your mind.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.600
Focus on
the other memories.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.100
They were created
for a reason.

37:10.500 --> 37:13.000
To hide from the truth?

37:16.600 --> 37:19.200
To endure it.

37:30.300 --> 37:32.600
I thought sunlight
burned you up.

37:33.700 --> 37:38.600
- [Chuckles] Special glass.
- Cool.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.500
You should, like, make a whole suit
out of it, like the pope has.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.700
How's your dad?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.700
He's fine.
They're releasing him now.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.900
<i>I should warn you.</i>
<i>He's pretty pissed.</i>

37:53.900 --> 37:55.800
I told him that you
took me out demon fighting...

37:55.800 --> 37:57.700
and, uh,
almost got me killed.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.600
He wants to have
a talk with you.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.200
- All right. I'll, uh...
- I'm kidding.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.700
Man, you gotta lighten up.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.000
<i>He thinks we spent</i>
<i>the whole night doing tests.</i>

38:08.000 --> 38:10.800
I told him I could bench-press,
like, 1,000 pounds.

38:12.700 --> 38:17.000
What are you gonna tell them
about who you are?

38:19.200 --> 38:22.900
The truth, more or less.
I'll tell them that I'm different.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.900
<i>I'll tell them it's...</i>
<i>actually a good thing.</i>

38:26.900 --> 38:28.700
I'll tell them
to stop worrying so much.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.800
- Well, they're parents.
- Yeah, I know.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.500
They'll feel a lot better knowing
you're looking out for me.

38:36.500 --> 38:40.300
We still haven't found Vail,
but we will.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.300
I'm not too worried
about him.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.300
There's nothing he can show me
I haven't already seen.

38:48.600 --> 38:53.100
Anyway, I just wanted
to say good-bye.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.900
I gotta go back
to my life now.

38:57.900 --> 39:01.100
Oh.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.600
<i>Do you really</i>
<i>have to leave... right now?</i>

39:07.700 --> 39:09.500
I kind of think I should.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.800
I need to take care
of my parents.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.600
This isn't their world.
They really don't feel safe here.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.700
You gotta do what you can
to protect your family.

39:24.200 --> 39:28.000
I learned that from my father.
