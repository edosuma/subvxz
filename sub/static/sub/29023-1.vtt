He watched his mother get beaten
to death. We all saw it.

Her master caught her trying to
hide us.

That’s an awful thing...

But you must trust that the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away

we’ll do almost anything to
survive.

can.

harboring you three...

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:42.430
was probably the freest thing
that poor mans mother ever did.

01:15:46.354 --> 01:15:49.795
I think I broke his nose.

01:15:49.828 --> 01:15:52.166

those flames.

going out.

garrison over there.

young.

There was thirteen of us plus my
pa. So, we took care for each
other.

did most of the mothering

She miscarried five-six times
before I was born.

Then Master Daniel’s sold me
away when I was twelve.

01:19:32.039 --> 01:19:38.853
Left her all alone.

01:19:38.886 --> 01:19:43.863
It’s a terrible thing.

I feel terrible for what
happened.

01:19:48.104 --> 01:19:51.644
Why’d it happen?

01:19:51.679 --> 01:19:55.085
Why’d I have to go back?

01:19:55.118 --> 01:20:01.932
She’d still be alive If I ain’t
never go back.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.866
From Maine actually.

difference seeing as you’s from
the north.
