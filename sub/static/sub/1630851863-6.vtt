00:06.120 --> 00:08.560
PREVIOUSLY ON MYTHO

00:09.840 --> 00:12.680
When I was born,
I was placed in a foster family.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.960
My mother didn't want me.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.040
Tell them!

00:15.560 --> 00:16.440
He's my son!

00:16.520 --> 00:17.960
Lorenzo is my son!

00:20.600 --> 00:23.480
-So how was Chile?
-Mexico? It was great.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.560
Hi. How are you?

00:24.640 --> 00:26.280
-Good. And you, Sandrine?
-Great.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.040
Patrick, I know it all.

00:28.120 --> 00:32.560
I know you married Sandrine
and that the pharmacist's son is yours.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.760
The aluminum factory
at the Tara's intersection?

00:35.840 --> 00:37.479
If the contract is renewed,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.800
that will help me hire you back.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.760
Is there a problem?

00:41.920 --> 00:44.400
The explosion. It's the aluminum factory.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.400
Did you hear about our organization,
Awakening to Life?

00:47.480 --> 00:50.400
It helps me. It's a therapeutic process.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.920
Carole doesn't sleep at home?

00:54.000 --> 00:54.960
No.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.120
Test out your happiness.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.760
It's Nonno. He's dead.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.440
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:29.040 --> 01:30.960
What do you wear to bury your father?

01:34.840 --> 01:36.280
That's a good question.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.960
Which one did he like best?

01:43.560 --> 01:47.240
There was one. But I lost it in the move.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.080
You look great in a suit.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.960
A gift from Nonno for Christmas.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.960
I told him, "It's stupid.
I'll never get a chance to wear a tie."

02:05.840 --> 02:07.360
Wait for me. I'm coming.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.199
But...

02:15.360 --> 02:17.400
Darling, you don't have to.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.760
I know but I'm happy to do it.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.920
I don't think that's
a wise choice of words.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.280
You didn't know him.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.480
I knew him. I met him several times.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.280
I'm your wife. I'm coming. We're married.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.640
Okay.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.920
Where did you buy it?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.200
Do you like it?

03:05.760 --> 03:09.280
Wait. Sorry. Don't take it the wrong way.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.480
It's not a good time.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.560
GO NAPLES

03:34.800 --> 03:35.720
Listen to this.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.920
You want to play that?

03:45.000 --> 03:45.880
Yes, I dig it.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.480
I'm not sure. It doesn't suit Nonno.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.680
It's not for him. It's for my party.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.200
Karina.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.800
Hi. Thank you for coming.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.960
Thank you.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
The Van Gogh room.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.440
Okay.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.760
Thank you for coming.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.120
It's in the Van Gogh room.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.120
Thank you.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.279
ClÃ©mence.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.320
I'm so sad for you.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.000
Thank you.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.280
-Hang in there.
-In the Van Gogh room.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.880
We'll soon be the same.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.440
-Seriously?
-Whatever.

04:41.000 --> 04:41.960
Virginie.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.000
Can you help me
with escorting the guests to the room?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.480
What for?

04:47.560 --> 04:48.640
Just do as I say.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.200
Okay?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.000
We don't know what happened.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.640
-She has my dress.
-What?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.200
The one I wanted to wear.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.840
Are you sure?

04:59.920 --> 05:03.240
Yes. I sewed a button back on. You'll see.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.360
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.920
I loved your father's pizzas.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.760
I was his favorite customer.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.160
It's in the Van Gogh room.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.880
-Then, we'll...
-Yes.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.040
That woman is so weird.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.360
She's trying to own you.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.320
-Really?
-Yes.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.400
-It's bad.
-Really bad.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.840
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.760
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.400
-Thank you for coming.
-It's normal.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.160
Here, a symbol of renewal.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
It's kind.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.520
I'm going in.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.960
On the right.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.960
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.080
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.600
What time does it start?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.440
-At 11:25, I think.
-Okay.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.520
LORENZO
INCOMING CALL

06:50.680 --> 06:51.760
You look great.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.240
Thank you.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.240
Are you all right? You don't look okay.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.520
I'm sad.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.520
He's still my father-in-law.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.360
No, that's my father.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.120
What do you mean?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.040
Your father-in-law

07:22.280 --> 07:25.120
is my father.
Nonno was your ex-father-in-law.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.040
Not in legal terms.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.360
You'll be fine.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.280
Excuse me.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
Where is Carole?

07:43.280 --> 07:46.040
She's not coming. I thought you knew.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.400
Thank you, everyone,

08:27.960 --> 08:31.040
for being here to support Carole
in this trying time.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.280
Carole isn't attending
her grandfather's cremation.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.960
She's asserting her choice of the Book

08:39.039 --> 08:41.080
and her trust in our community.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.640
Let this memorial service begin.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.560
There's no music?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.480
He's struggling.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.040
Is there a problem?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.840
I don't understand. It was working.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.840
Let's see.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.320
-Here.
-Thanks.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.640
Dear family, ladies and gentlemen,

09:32.720 --> 09:36.840
we are gathered here today
to pay one last tribute

09:36.920 --> 09:39.120
to Mr. Giannini who died a few days ago.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.680
Together, let's remember....

09:43.960 --> 09:44.960
Ciro?

09:45.440 --> 09:47.280
Ciro.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.280
-Ciro.
-Together, let's remember Ciro,

09:50.120 --> 09:53.640
the man he used to be,
and his place in our lives.

09:54.320 --> 09:59.080
To all of those who have lost a parent,
a relative, a confidant, a friend.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.720
Maybe someone would like to speak.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.720
Karina?

10:11.800 --> 10:13.000
Do you want to talk?

10:37.880 --> 10:42.080
Thank you, all of you, for being here...

10:42.720 --> 10:45.960
today to honor the memory...

10:47.640 --> 10:49.800
of my... dad.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.320
I wanted to...

11:01.520 --> 11:04.080
to say stuff about him but...

11:16.560 --> 11:18.520
Maybe Virginie, you want...

11:19.480 --> 11:20.880
to read this poem?

11:21.960 --> 11:22.800
You know.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.480
No?

11:27.960 --> 11:30.760
We had planned to play his favorite music.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.120
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.720
Of course, I...

11:46.680 --> 11:48.800
I'm talking about someone...

11:49.880 --> 11:51.280
that you don't know.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.840
Unless...

11:55.800 --> 11:58.600
Unless some of you would buy pizza.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.960
The best ones in town.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.280
What he meant to me was...

12:06.000 --> 12:07.720
the concept of feeding people.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.120
It was his way to love people,

12:11.200 --> 12:12.280
to talk to people.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.200
To give them something.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.720
-Does someone want to speak?
-Yes.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.440
I think that...

12:25.320 --> 12:27.760
the most important thing about loss

12:28.520 --> 12:32.080
is to understand that it's not the end,

12:33.640 --> 12:34.920
it's a continuity.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.520
We live in a society
where we separate the world of the living

12:40.600 --> 12:42.680
from the world of the dead. It's a pity.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.200
That makes us children.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.480
This memorial service

12:50.480 --> 12:52.200
should also be

12:54.080 --> 12:55.560
a love memorial.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.360
Here.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.920
I made pizza

13:40.520 --> 13:41.640
in memory of Nonno.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.320
Well, it's gluten-free.
The mozzarella is made of tofu.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.480
Don't worry, Jeff.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.360
It's nice of you to welcome us.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.040
It's Nonno?

13:54.680 --> 13:55.520
Yes.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.480
What will you do with it?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.680
The ashes must be scattered soon.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.920
So that the spirit can travel.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.480
One of my friends snorted
his father's ashes.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.280
He wanted to have a "dead trip".

14:11.280 --> 14:13.360
I know where you can put them.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.800
At the Pantheon in Paris.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.480
We'll put them in our pockets.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.640
We go in and we scatter them
discreetly inside.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.880
One day, Nonno told me

14:25.960 --> 14:28.960
he wanted to end his days at home,
in Italy.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.520
But you decide.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.320
I'd like to keep the urn in my bedroom.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.600
Me too.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.520
Every other week, then.
Just like with Mom and Dad.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.520
I'll bring the apple juice.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.320
I'll help you.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.240
Did you warn Lorenzo?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.760
Nope. No.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.040
Watch your head.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.520
It's pretty here.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.560
Thank you.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.320
No smoking inside.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.640
How are you?

15:12.560 --> 15:13.400
Is it doing well?

15:13.880 --> 15:14.840
The food truck?

15:15.680 --> 15:18.040
At the beginning,
it was hard but it's okay.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.120
Congratulations.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.120
It's thanks to you.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.480
You told me to impress you.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.000
There you go.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.960
I knew it. I saw it in the cards.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.160
-It's just the beginning.
-Really?

15:35.840 --> 15:38.600
In a few years, you'll look back on this

15:39.200 --> 15:41.800
and you'll say:
"It started in this parking lot."

15:43.720 --> 15:46.000
Do you see anything else for me?

15:47.000 --> 15:47.920
I see a woman.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.480
Cool.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.280
Do I know her?

15:57.280 --> 15:58.280
You do know her.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.200
Is she like you?

16:01.280 --> 16:04.080
No. Not at all.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.640
-That's a shame.
-No.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.160
She's great.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
Some wine, maybe?

16:22.560 --> 16:23.720
Yes.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.680
How will you do this?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.840
That's it, or nothing.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.480
What if it rains?

16:56.320 --> 16:57.160
It won't.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.360
I'm sorry for Sandrine's reaction.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.000
She's urnophobic.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.800
The phobia of urns.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.160
The phobia of urns? Is that real?

17:10.319 --> 17:13.000
Yeah. Well, apparently.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.319
I'll ask your mother to come get it.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
I'm sorry.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.520
I have something to tell you,
but don't judge me. Okay?

17:26.000 --> 17:26.839
Okay.

17:28.640 --> 17:29.599
I didn't cry.

17:30.839 --> 17:35.040
I didn't cry when I heard about it
or when I saw him in his coffin.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.160
You know why?

17:39.280 --> 17:40.520
Because of my party.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.600
I'm so excited about it...

17:46.160 --> 17:47.760
I can't cry for Nonno.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.360
You know, it's... it's normal, honey.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.560
You need time to process...

17:58.040 --> 17:59.360
what you've lost.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.880
Then you'll be sad, much later.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.560
It can take weeks, months

18:08.360 --> 18:09.240
or years.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.520
Then one day, sadness will just hit you.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.080
Elvira!

18:46.880 --> 18:48.040
Where are you going?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.840
-To work.
-Why didn't you wake me up?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.440
You were sleeping.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.320
Won't you stay?

18:55.000 --> 18:55.840
No.

19:00.080 --> 19:00.920
See you tonight?

19:01.880 --> 19:02.720
Maybe.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.480
<i>You use the crystal's energy</i>

19:10.560 --> 19:13.920
to work on contrariety knots.
Ten days for free.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.360
Thank you.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.560
Here. For you.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.880
-What's that?
-The cost of the memorial.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.400
What?

19:31.480 --> 19:33.080
I wasn't told I had to pay.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.440
Choir, buffet.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.160
What is this?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.920
"Cel grave"? What's that? 8000 euros?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.560
The price of the celestial grave,

19:49.640 --> 19:52.960
so that your grandfather's soul
won't be blocked despite the cremation.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.080
But I have to pay 13,000 euros?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.440
Talk to the hierarchy.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.520
Hakim? What's going on?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.800
Dismissed for serious misconduct.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.840
Because of the factory?

20:18.600 --> 20:19.640
It's my fault.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
It's your fault.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.440
You're responsible for yourself.
So, she's out.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.280
Maybe I'll get severance pay
since I'm pregnant.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.160
I'm so sorry.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.160
That's life, right.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.560
Hi.

20:58.960 --> 20:59.920
Hi.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.640
-You're not in Paris?
-I'm here for a few days.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.240
I heard about your grandfather.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.240
I went to the funeral home but I...

21:11.320 --> 21:14.760
-I didn't stay. I don't like those places.
-Like everyone else.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.760
I lost a friend when I was younger.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.840
It scarred me.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.840
I'm sorry.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.080
Don't worry.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.240
You work here?

21:32.400 --> 21:35.560
Yeah. I'm mainly helping my uncle.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.920
It's my first job experience. It's great.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.480
That's great.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.640
You won't stay here forever?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.840
Well, actually...

21:45.840 --> 21:48.080
I'm going to a hotel management school
in Germany.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.480
A top-tier school.
A three-year program. It's great.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.640
After, I'll be able to work
in the top restaurants.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.240
The best schools are in Paris.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.400
How are things for you over there?

22:05.880 --> 22:07.040
I dropped out of college.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.400
I'm writing. College was useless.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.440
I found a publisher.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.000
-No?
-He wants to publish my novel.

22:16.080 --> 22:16.920
Really? Cool.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.880
That's fantastic.

22:18.960 --> 22:19.800
Yes.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.840
You haven't changed.

22:25.320 --> 22:28.000
You're always grandiloquent.
"That's fantastic."

22:28.080 --> 22:29.800
It's great. That's what I mean.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.200
It's a small publisher.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.880
I'm waiting on Gallimard.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.160
-So you like Paris?
-It's cool.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.920
It's cool but it's very expensive.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.160
I bet. It's very expensive.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.040
I'm looking for a roommate.

22:48.640 --> 22:52.000
That's great. You split the cost.
Great idea.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.400
Are you stupid or what?

22:57.440 --> 23:00.440
-What?
-I'm not asking for your opinion.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.680
I want you as my roommate.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.360
In Paris.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.600
We'd live together.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.520
I can't afford it.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.160
You could work in a dump there too
but you'd be paid three times more.

23:22.240 --> 23:26.080
Right. But there's the school...
I can't leave like that.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.240
What do you think?
That you'll learn things in school?

23:30.400 --> 23:34.360
You learn things by working.
Not in a school in Germany.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.320
Or anywhere.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.200
Think about it.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.480
And tell me.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.360
Hi.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.440
Hi.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.040
They're going crazy.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.800
Just three so far. They're warming up
before the others arrive.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.400
How are you doing?

24:47.120 --> 24:49.880
-Is there a problem?
-No. You're beautiful.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.440
Thank you. It's awesome.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.560
Open the door.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.480
They listen to these old songs?

25:06.040 --> 25:09.640
I gave them my tape compilations.

25:10.440 --> 25:14.800
I told them it was like a playlist.
Her friends had never seen that.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.000
They've never seen a cassette tape?

25:17.080 --> 25:19.800
No. I had to explain the principle.

25:22.080 --> 25:26.000
You want something? Virgin sangria?

25:26.080 --> 25:26.920
What's that?

25:27.400 --> 25:30.360
Non-alcoholic sangria. Grape juice.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.080
Well...

25:34.160 --> 25:35.840
I'm here to pick the urn up.

25:36.680 --> 25:40.560
Yes. It's in the bedroom.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.680
Your wife's not there?

25:53.280 --> 25:56.440
No. Virginie told her to go.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.600
It's a bit tense.

26:01.920 --> 26:02.840
You've...

26:04.920 --> 26:06.080
You've redecorated.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.320
A little bit.
Some of it is not to my taste.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.400
So. I'm sorry, we had...

26:17.120 --> 26:18.200
a problem.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.520
What will you do with it?

26:27.880 --> 26:28.720
I don't know.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
I love this song.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.080
It's the summer of '99 compilation.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.760
We went camping in the Vercors.

26:47.960 --> 26:48.880
It was great.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.240
So are you okay?

26:57.200 --> 26:58.040
No.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.760
I'll probably get fired.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.120
Really? Again?

27:06.520 --> 27:08.480
They're closing the agency. I need a job.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.600
You should join me in training.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.960
In training? To do what?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.720
I don't know.

27:28.080 --> 27:28.920
What?

27:32.320 --> 27:33.240
Nothing.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.920
Seeing you here...

27:37.400 --> 27:38.920
it has a strange effect on me.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.040
You too?

27:43.360 --> 27:44.320
No.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.360
-I'm leaving.
-Stay a little bit.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.840
Come over here. I'm so thirsty.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.760
We'll be exhausted.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.400
-We danced too much.
-What?

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
The water is yellow.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.520
-Yeah.
-It looks like wine.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.000
Or scotch.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.480
I have an idea. Use a flute.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.960
We'll put that in there. It'll be great.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.840
It looks like we're drinking champagne.
Look.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.040
It's cool.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.400
Sea urchins.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.640
It's your party.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.320
I don't know.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.160
Why are you here?

29:20.040 --> 29:21.160
Carole is here.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.600
Is this a bad time?

29:25.160 --> 29:26.000
No.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.720
I came to pick up Nonno. The urn.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.120
My bedroom is now an exercise room?

29:33.000 --> 29:33.840
Not at all.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.840
No. It's temporary.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.320
Can you lend me 13,000 euros?

29:43.680 --> 29:44.520
I'll pay you back.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.520
What is it for?

29:51.840 --> 29:54.320
For once, help me.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.320
No questions asked. Just help me.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.880
Life is not a kiwi.

30:00.440 --> 30:05.280
You can't do whatever you want. Leaving.
Coming back. Ask for 13,000 euros.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.920
You're in no position to judge.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.600
And you?

30:12.240 --> 30:13.480
Isn't it weird?

30:14.560 --> 30:16.360
Anyone can have children.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.440
Carole!

30:20.520 --> 30:21.360
Wait, Carole!

30:23.640 --> 30:24.480
Mr. Lambert!

30:24.560 --> 30:26.480
-Virginie is feeling sick.
-Come.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.560
Are you all right?

30:32.640 --> 30:33.480
Virginie!

30:34.240 --> 30:35.400
What did you take?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.880
-Are you totally wasted?
-No.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.800
What the hell?

30:41.880 --> 30:47.080
-You can't talk to me like that.
-No, Dad. We drank the tap water.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.480
The tap water? I'm not stupid.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.720
I swear. It's true.

30:54.040 --> 30:54.960
Honey.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.120
What are you doing?

31:03.840 --> 31:04.880
I'm leaving.

31:05.920 --> 31:06.920
Just like that?

31:08.920 --> 31:10.800
I need to pay you back.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.320
Vincent, can you give us a minute?

31:23.320 --> 31:24.320
If you leave,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.680
who will run the stand?

31:27.160 --> 31:32.240
Exactly. I'm doing it for the bedroom.
I can't work anywhere else.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.480
And I can't earn money.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.360
Carole, I've thought about it.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.120
I'd like to give you the celestial grave.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.480
That'll leave only 5,000 euros.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.520
I can press your case with the hierarchy.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.640
Who are they?

31:50.520 --> 31:52.440
Most of them live on the boat.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.000
If you want to meet them...

31:56.480 --> 31:59.680
Well, 50,000 euros for a cruise,
I won't be able to meet them.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.040
I can call the head office.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.840
They're looking for crew members.

32:02.920 --> 32:07.800
You'll pay us back and you'll be
a member of the organization.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.440
Well, no. It's stupid.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.720
Why?

32:18.040 --> 32:22.120
The working conditions are hard.
Recruitment is very strict.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.560
And you'd have to be away
for several months.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.320
I don't think you can do it.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.960
You'd be away from everything.
Your parents. Me.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.480
I'll travel? Go around the world?

32:36.240 --> 32:38.040
And I'll pay you back.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.720
You really want me to call them
to propose your application?

32:46.280 --> 32:48.080
Shouldn't I tell my parents?

32:48.560 --> 32:49.520
It's up to you.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.880
I'm proud of you.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.920
And I support you.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.040
You're a remarkable young woman.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
Is Virginie okay?

33:08.480 --> 33:09.320
Yeah.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.400
However, we shouldn't drink the tap water.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.320
Damn.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.800
NEW MESSAGE
ELVIRA

33:23.240 --> 33:24.320
What's that?

33:26.840 --> 33:28.920
It's a bracelet.

33:31.000 --> 33:31.920
Whose bracelet?

33:32.720 --> 33:33.720
No idea. Yours?

33:33.800 --> 33:34.640
No.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.280
It must belong to
one of Virginie's friends.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.280
Is it Elvira's?

33:44.080 --> 33:44.920
She was here?

33:48.680 --> 33:49.520
No.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.360
I remember. You're right.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.640
It's mine. Sorry.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.880
You scared me.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.320
There's no reason. Why?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.480
I don't know. You scared me.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.240
Everything's all right. Good night.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.720
Good night.

34:35.880 --> 34:36.719
Come in.

34:45.560 --> 34:46.600
Hi.

34:46.679 --> 34:47.520
Hi.

34:57.880 --> 34:58.719
It's weird.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.240
Let's say it's not...

35:06.720 --> 35:08.280
It's not very glamorous.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.480
It wasn't possible at your house.

35:12.560 --> 35:15.760
And my home is too ugly.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.360
Will we be able to do it?

35:50.320 --> 35:51.160
I don't know.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.520
We'll see.

36:10.920 --> 36:11.760
Wait.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.520
Howdy!

37:01.000 --> 37:03.360
Don't smile like that.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.160
I can't help it.

37:05.800 --> 37:06.840
I'm happy.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.840
I feel at home.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.800
Shut up.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.800
No, no.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.560
What are you doing?

38:41.280 --> 38:42.160
I have to go.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.880
You don't...

38:48.360 --> 38:49.640
You can't stay a bit?

38:50.680 --> 38:51.520
Look.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.720
I really enjoyed being together.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.000
But I...

39:01.600 --> 39:03.520
If I stay longer, it'll get sad.

39:04.600 --> 39:05.440
Wait.

39:06.960 --> 39:07.960
But...

39:09.640 --> 39:13.120
Don't you think that it's great
what's happening between us?

39:15.440 --> 39:16.960
And what is happening?

39:18.480 --> 39:20.440
Well, you see...

39:23.600 --> 39:25.440
We could all go on a trip.

39:26.440 --> 39:27.280
What?

39:28.560 --> 39:32.360
You were right. We should have done that.
Go on a trip.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.480
You got used to traveling with Corinne.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.440
Sandrine.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.760
When we were in Mexico...

39:44.840 --> 39:48.240
I would imagine myself with you
and the kids.

39:51.400 --> 39:55.560
We should go with the kids,
Sam, Carole, Virginie.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.320
And the little Minh Tri.
I could kidnap him.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.880
And Lorenzo.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.440
What, Lorenzo?

40:05.600 --> 40:06.600
Well...

40:08.040 --> 40:09.200
He's your son.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.200
You know...

40:13.560 --> 40:17.160
At first, I was angry. I was mad at you,

40:18.000 --> 40:19.320
that you never told me.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.120
But now, I get it.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.440
You get what?

40:27.800 --> 40:31.920
You were in pain. You wanted to forget.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.800
He was in pain too. Like you.
He wanted to get back at us.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.760
And now, we have to forgive.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.360
You need to forgive yourself. You were 15.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.680
No, no. Wait.

40:47.800 --> 40:48.840
It's not that.

40:51.600 --> 40:52.800
You don't know anything.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.280
Tell me.

41:02.840 --> 41:03.680
Elvira.

41:04.840 --> 41:05.680
Tell me.

41:10.760 --> 41:11.760
You can tell me.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.560
I'm not sure.

41:17.080 --> 41:17.920
You can.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.280
You know,

41:40.280 --> 41:41.560
Lorenzo's father,

41:44.640 --> 41:47.040
I was in love with him.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.880
<i>But he didn't give a shit.</i>

41:52.040 --> 41:54.360
He just wanted to have sex with me.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.600
Come on, I'll show you something.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
<i>I was telling him that I was scared,</i>
<i>that I was too young.</i>

42:06.680 --> 42:07.600
I didn't want to.

42:11.960 --> 42:12.800
<i>One night,</i>

42:14.360 --> 42:16.040
<i>in the villa we were squatting in...</i>

42:18.640 --> 42:19.600
<i>Stop it.</i>

42:21.240 --> 42:22.240
<i>Stop it. Please.</i>

42:24.480 --> 42:25.920
He forced himself on me.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.320
<i>Stop.</i>

42:35.280 --> 42:36.560
Afterwards, I was scared.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.040
I ran off.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.360
What are you doing?

42:40.440 --> 42:41.560
Leave me alone.

42:41.640 --> 42:42.800
<i>He caught up with me.</i>

42:44.960 --> 42:46.160
Itâs you who provoked me.

42:46.240 --> 42:49.400
<i>He told me it was my fault,</i>
<i>that I teased him.</i>

42:49.480 --> 42:50.600
You're a liar!

42:50.680 --> 42:51.600
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

42:54.120 --> 42:55.120
-I pushed him.
<i>-Liar.</i>

42:57.320 --> 42:58.480
<i>He fell backwards.</i>

42:59.120 --> 43:01.280
<i>A huge tarpaulin covered the pool.</i>

43:03.720 --> 43:06.480
He was stuck. I stood there.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.440
Help!

43:10.840 --> 43:12.800
<i>I just stood there.</i>

43:15.480 --> 43:16.840
I watched him struggle.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.160
<i>Until he stopped moving.</i>

43:42.600 --> 43:45.400
It's not your fault. It was an accident.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.120
No.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.000
It wasn't an accident.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.280
It was. You couldn't do anything.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.880
I pushed him.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.400
I watched him die.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.760
I told him: "Die."

44:03.520 --> 44:04.800
I did that. You understand?

44:09.760 --> 44:11.120
You didn't kill him.

44:14.520 --> 44:17.040
You wanted to know. Now you know.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.760
Can I ask you a personal question?

45:07.840 --> 45:08.960
You know what they say.

45:09.640 --> 45:12.640
Questions are never indiscreet,
but answers can be.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.400
Why did you never commit?

45:16.880 --> 45:20.000
You don't have any kids or family.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.320
I have a family. It's you.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.320
You know what I mean.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.720
This life suits me.

45:34.080 --> 45:39.200
We're supposed to make our way.
But I'm not a highway.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.320
I'm...

45:42.200 --> 45:43.040
How to put it?

45:44.280 --> 45:47.080
I'm a crossroad. That's right.
I'm a crossroad.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.720
I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.

45:51.200 --> 45:54.560
But people can move around me.
That's good enough.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.120
You'll never leave?

45:57.000 --> 45:57.840
No.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.360
But you want to leave.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.400
Yes.

46:06.440 --> 46:07.440
I'm hesitating.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.400
What are the two options?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.800
I'm torn between...

46:13.800 --> 46:16.480
making the right but boring choice

46:18.400 --> 46:21.240
and a very wrong but tempting choice.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.000
Let me think.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.760
The wise decision.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.280
You're right.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.800
I know.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.800
And that you'll do the opposite.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.200
I'll get the other boxes.

46:48.720 --> 46:49.560
Hi.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.080
Hi.

46:51.160 --> 46:52.040
Is it open?

46:54.200 --> 46:55.480
Yes, of course.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.600
I heard it's delicious.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.000
We do our best.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.000
Elvira. It's me again.

47:15.800 --> 47:19.640
Try to call me back.
We really need to talk.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.240
I...

47:23.760 --> 47:26.760
I can't stop thinking about what you said.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.520
We fucked up.

47:30.240 --> 47:33.200
We seriously fucked up.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.680
We should stick together.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.880
It can get better.
We have to deal with this mess.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.560
You should go see your son in Italy.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.360
You have to tell him

47:49.840 --> 47:51.000
what you told me.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.760
The lies must stop now.

47:59.720 --> 48:00.840
I'll call you back.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.360
Take care.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.200
Hello.

48:38.720 --> 48:39.560
Hello.

48:40.760 --> 48:41.960
Hello, you.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.560
Hello.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.160
I'm your daddy.

48:48.040 --> 48:49.720
I'm your daddy. Look at me.

48:49.800 --> 48:50.640
What the hell?

48:53.240 --> 48:54.320
He's very cute.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.440
Hi.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.120
Olivier.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.000
Brigitte's husband.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.880
I know. We met the other day. Patrick.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.280
He seems very nice.

49:04.800 --> 49:05.640
Yeah.

49:06.120 --> 49:06.960
He's lovely.

49:08.160 --> 49:12.320
And what's his personality like?

49:14.600 --> 49:17.480
Well, he's very gentle.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.800
And he's a fighter too.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.200
He's...

49:24.680 --> 49:27.960
He's a seducer. When there's a girl...

49:30.120 --> 49:31.480
-Funny.
-Yeah.

49:32.040 --> 49:32.960
I'm crazy about him.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.840
Goodbye, Minh Tri.

49:43.680 --> 49:46.920
Wait. I was thinking...

49:48.440 --> 49:53.040
I know you were with my wife.
You were depressed after the separation.

49:54.240 --> 50:01.160
Even though you have every reason to
hate me, I'd like to have a beer with you.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.760
I said it.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.400
Okay.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.200
Elvira.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.080
The liquidator has arrived.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.000
You're the first on the list.
He's waiting for you.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.400
Yes?

50:42.520 --> 50:43.560
We meet again.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.160
The board has brought me in
to close the agency.

50:50.840 --> 50:54.360
Maxence,
I guess I don't need to explain anything.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.240
Maxence doesn't exist.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.680
Here, I'm Mr. Brunet.

51:01.280 --> 51:02.160
That's a pity.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.760
I'd rather talk to Maxence.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.920
A lovely man who didn't like
responsibility much.

51:12.120 --> 51:15.000
"When life gets hard, when things change,

51:16.280 --> 51:18.440
only true love stays the same."

51:20.320 --> 51:22.280
Shakespeare, Elvira. You know him?

51:24.040 --> 51:26.160
Yes. Fuck him.

51:43.560 --> 51:48.360
ELVIRA
THE GARDEN LOOKS SAD

51:48.440 --> 51:50.080
WITHOUT YOU.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.240
I'M SAD WITHOUT YOU.

52:15.880 --> 52:16.720
Are you okay?

52:17.960 --> 52:18.880
I'm thirsty.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.280
Wait.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.480
No tap water.

52:39.800 --> 52:40.680
Thanks.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.360
You don't seem better.

52:52.960 --> 52:53.800
NEW MESSAGE

52:53.880 --> 52:56.400
ME TOO.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.040
What is it?

53:10.400 --> 53:11.480
What's up with you?

53:17.840 --> 53:18.680
You're not okay?

53:33.120 --> 53:34.360
Come on. Cry.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.400
Guess who.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.000
Hi there.

57:36.480 --> 57:38.960
