WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:08.242
* Let's go

00:08.276 --> 00:10.344
* Push it to the limit
if you wanna win it *

00:10.378 --> 00:12.180
* Harbor no room for the weak,
nor the timid *

00:12.213 --> 00:14.182
* Bit too long, you got
accustomed to the gimmicks *

00:14.215 --> 00:16.750
* It's like they don't care
that the real is at the finish *

00:16.784 --> 00:18.386
* No blemish, no honor

00:18.419 --> 00:20.321
* Let the flutes go,
the snake charmer, God *

00:20.354 --> 00:22.190
* The kingpin of
every street corner *

00:22.223 --> 00:24.525
* You can't say I didn't
ever warn ya, yeah... *

00:24.558 --> 00:26.494
*

00:39.307 --> 00:41.175
* Push it.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.317
(tires screech)

00:49.350 --> 00:51.419
(truck horn blares)

00:51.452 --> 00:53.454
(tires squeal)

00:59.460 --> 01:01.129
Out. Now.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.797
Move!
Okay, okay.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.734
On your knees.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.470
(engine revs, tires squeal)

01:12.206 --> 01:14.475
One, two, three.
Eyes on me.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.876
Stop!
(two gunshots)

01:15.909 --> 01:17.211
(truck driver groans)

01:22.916 --> 01:24.785
Why the hell did
you kill him?

01:24.818 --> 01:26.887
I didn't like how he
looked at her.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.289
You told me I was
gonna race the winner.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.757
Not watch you cap
some trucker.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.493
And you told us you
wanted to do business.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.228
Now we got blood ties.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.538
(truck door slams)

01:49.177 --> 01:51.145
(train horn blows)

01:51.179 --> 01:53.614
Okay.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.916
GPS systems are off-line,

01:55.949 --> 01:57.918
just killing the cell interfaces
and we're good to go.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.288
You're a genius, Whip.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.323
If I warned you, you
wouldn't have come.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.758
You want us to trust you? We
needed to know that you legit.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.360
I'm just here to cut
a deal, okay?

02:06.394 --> 02:07.595
I didn't sign up
for murder.
Our broker

02:07.628 --> 02:09.863
isn't a man eager
to meet new people.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.799
And like I said, he's already
got a buyer for China.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.868
Then why the hell am I here?
We're sticking our necks
our for you on this.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.905
Try to appreciate it.
You make the deal happen,

02:17.938 --> 02:19.540
I'll make sure
everybody gets paid.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.779
Wait for a call from Juergen.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.881
Be ready to go
where he tells you.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.917
Juergen Richter?

02:29.950 --> 02:32.253
That's your broker?
I told you.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.721
We ain't messing around.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.800
(car door opens)

02:46.834 --> 02:49.270
What's up, youngster?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.805
Looking good, Raymont.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.541
How are you healing up?

02:53.574 --> 02:55.809
I'm all right.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.944
My mom call you or something?

02:56.977 --> 02:57.945
She did.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.713
Is that all right?
Yeah.

02:59.747 --> 03:00.914
I guess so.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.616
Mom!

03:02.650 --> 03:05.586
How's school? Getting any love
for that scar?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.555
Nah. Just questions.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.557
All right, wait till
you get to college.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.725
Story like that, you're gonna be
big man on campus. Trust me.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.627
If I still decide to go.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.364
Hondo.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.766
Thanks for coming by.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.534
Raymont, get your books
for school.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.703
You are gonna miss home room.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.705
(sighs)

03:26.740 --> 03:28.542
(door opens)
Little rough lately?

03:28.576 --> 03:29.543
(door closes)

03:29.577 --> 03:31.579
(sighs)

03:31.612 --> 03:34.248
When your boy gets shot by SWAT,
you don't expect it to be easy,

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
but Raymont is sliding.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.885
I mean, physically,
he's doing great.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.320
Mentally, it takes time.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.821
Raymont doesn't have time.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.790
He's got college
applications, exams.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.358
The way I see it?

03:44.392 --> 03:47.027
Your people did the
damage inside and out.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.729
Your job to make it right.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.465
100%. I'm not gonna
let him slide off track.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.466
He barely eats.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.002
Nightmares.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.306
And yesterday
I found this.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.940
Under his bed.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.911
He know you found it?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.915
It's loaded.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.622
The numbers are scratched off,
which means he bought it

04:14.655 --> 04:16.757
on the street from people he
shouldn't be associating with.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.626
The son I knew
before he was shot

04:18.659 --> 04:20.027
would never bring
home a gun.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.729
Okay, okay.
I understand.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.331
But listen to me.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.765
I'm gonna hold on to this.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.567
And I know he's got
to get off to school,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.902
but you bring him by SWAT
afterwards and I'll talk to him.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.738
(sighs)
Thank you.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.506
He likes you.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.508
Not just because
you saved his life.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.346
He thinks you're good people.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.280
(dog barking in distance)

04:45.953 --> 04:47.888
(phone rings)

04:49.757 --> 04:52.626
Yeah. What's up, Street?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.895
STREET:
If I'd gotten there ten seconds
sooner, I could've stopped it.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.597
What were you doing there
in the first place?

04:56.630 --> 04:57.798
HONDO:
It's an old undercover gig
from Long Beach.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.368
He told me about it
a half hour ago.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.369
I was working
these street racers.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.836
The ones jacking luxury cars?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.105
I read about it
in your file.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.441
I thought that case
went cold.
STREET: It did.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.809
I'd sold myself as a buyer

05:08.842 --> 05:10.411
looking to ship
the rides to China.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.679
Then they told me their broker
had another guy.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.980
I didn't hear from them
for a couple months.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.748
I thought it was dead.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.084
And then last night, they
spot me at this bar I like.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.587
It's a miracle my cover
held, and they tell me

05:19.620 --> 05:22.022
they got a deal
that I can't pass up.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.557
So, Street decides
that leaping in

05:23.591 --> 05:24.958
without notifying anyone
was a smart plan.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.427
STREET:
I didn't have time.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.496
What was I gonna do?
Call with them watching?

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
And now you've witnessed
a murder.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.732
So, why isn't this crew
in custody?

05:31.765 --> 05:33.867
Because of who they're
in business with.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.870
HONDO:
Juergen Richter.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.106
STREET: The Juergen Richter.
If I'd known he was tied in,

05:39.139 --> 05:41.108
I would've never
let the case go cold.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.977
Guy is top dog in high-end
stolen goods.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.146
Cars, art, diamonds.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.015
Moves more volume than Amazon.
JESSICA: I know him.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.851
SIS has been trying to build
a case for years.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.119
Yeah, along with FBI, DOJ

05:52.152 --> 05:53.454
and every other agency
with initials.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.589
Yeah, but nothing sticks.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.591
He's smart, Street.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.126
He keeps a tight circle.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.495
Anyone he thinks might
flip on him gets got.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.630
Except me.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.498
You haven't met him yet.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.133
The last guy the feds
were working for intel--

06:06.166 --> 06:07.868
rumor is, Richter gutted him.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.537
Personally.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.638
JESSICA:
Some people think
he's got connections

06:10.671 --> 06:12.440
inside the department.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.575
Tip him off when the heat's on.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.776
Well, then now's our chance.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.545
No one outside SWAT
knows about this,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.947
and any minute he's gonna
call me to set a meet.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.783
I agree to take the cars,
we nail him at the buy.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.918
HONDO: Richter will pick a spot
that he's already staked out.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.654
That won't give us time
to set up anything,

06:26.687 --> 06:29.490
and we'll be lucky
to keep eyes on Street.

06:29.523 --> 06:32.025
I know I've had a
bumpy start here.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.495
Let me make up for it.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.564
I'm giving you a chance

06:36.597 --> 06:39.533
to bust Juergen Richter.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.835
You're really gonna
say no to that?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.804
Give us a minute.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.875
(siren wails in distance)

06:52.580 --> 06:54.948
Richter's major.
No doubt.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.084
But there's a lot of variables
in this we can't control,

06:57.117 --> 06:58.652
the biggest one being Street.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.887
You don't think he's up for it?

06:59.920 --> 07:02.623
I think he's come a long way.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.191
I think he's smart,
but he's way overconfident,

07:04.224 --> 07:05.826
unpredictable,
and a gig like this

07:05.859 --> 07:07.628
can go sideways real fast.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.897
If it were you going in,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.565
you'd still be against it?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.703
I'll clear it
with Long Beach,

07:15.736 --> 07:17.538
but won't mention Richter
to be safe.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.806
You're asking a lot of this kid.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.107
Street is SWAT.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.175
I have to trust my people
in the field.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.778
(sighs)

07:24.812 --> 07:26.780
All right, I'll coach him up.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.849
I'll get him ready.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.452
*

08:03.851 --> 08:06.219
*

08:06.253 --> 08:08.822
(both grunting and panting)

08:16.129 --> 08:17.197
(groans)

08:21.669 --> 08:23.804
(both grunting)

08:27.941 --> 08:29.076
(groans)

08:32.312 --> 08:34.214
Nice climb.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.084
Thanks, back there.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.219
(sighs)
You think he's
gonna pass us?

08:42.155 --> 08:44.625
Photos were pulled from failed
cases against Richter.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.660
This dude is slippery as hell.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.262
Everybody knows he's dirty, but
no one's been able to prove it.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.732
CHRIS: He's made a career
out of escaping police stings.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.133
WARREN:
Sergeant Harrelson?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.168
HONDO:
Warren, what's up, man?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.137
Warren here was Richter's
parole officer years back.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.338
Only man we've been
able to track down

08:58.371 --> 08:59.940
who had in-person contact.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.809
I work private security now.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.945
Never forgot Juergen Richter,
though. Strange dude.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.147
HONDO: Warren, what can
you tell us about Richter?
WARREN: Smart as hell.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.349
But he's into this Brazilian
spiritism thing.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.951
Oh, like a religion?
WARREN: More like a cult.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.886
He talked about things

09:12.920 --> 09:16.056
like his spirit crew and
human sacrifice rituals.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.691
Yeah, well, that's not spooky
at all.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.159
WARREN: You want to get into
business with Richter,

09:19.192 --> 09:21.194
you have to let him think
he knows you.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.663
STREET:
Okay. How do I do that?

09:22.696 --> 09:23.964
Eye contact.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.232
He likes a lot of it,

09:25.265 --> 09:27.067
like he can
read you somehow.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.836
And he'll try and see if he can
make you slip up,

09:28.869 --> 09:31.104
so expect a lot
of awkward pauses.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.640
Kind of like
a typical day for you.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.774
WARREN:
Except, don't drink.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.376
Richter doesn't respect people
who poison their bodies.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.979
(phone rings)

09:39.012 --> 09:40.848
Yeah.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.751
I'll be there.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.689
Jake and Ike's in an hour.
The cop joint?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.858
WARREN: Probably gets off
knowing they can ID him

09:50.891 --> 09:52.860
but don't have the dirt
to arrest him.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.361
And a diner full of police is
the last place

09:54.394 --> 09:56.163
an undercover
would want to meet.
Yeah.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.800
It's your first test.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.735
(door opens)

10:03.704 --> 10:05.238
All right, Tan and Luca
will have your tail.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.840
If you get into trouble,
they'll bail you out.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.075
Ah, relax, boss.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.743
I'm bringing my
spirit crew as backup.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.078
You're gonna need
more than a few jokes

10:11.111 --> 10:12.746
to pull one over
on this guy, Street.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.281
I logged a lot of
hours in plain clothes

10:14.314 --> 10:16.016
and I know how easy it is
for things to go sideways.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.851
I worked some covert
in Long Beach.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.720
I've done this before.
Not on my team you haven't,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.121
and not up against
somebody like this.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.691
Okay.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.093
Any advice?
I'm all ears.
First,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.428
lay off the humor. A guy who
makes light of everything

10:28.461 --> 10:30.764
usually has something to hide,
and don't go running your mouth.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.399
The more you talk, the
more chances you have

10:32.432 --> 10:34.167
of making mistakes.

10:34.201 --> 10:34.935
You're really
worried about this.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.737
Richter is no joke.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.138
This is as real as it gets.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.740
If you think you're
in trouble, you are.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.008
Don't wait around
to be sure,

10:41.041 --> 10:42.209
you get the hell out of there.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.276
I won't let you down.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.345
(sighs)

10:45.378 --> 10:47.014
I know you won't.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.749
Cortez and I
wouldn't be putting you in

10:48.782 --> 10:50.650
if we weren't sure of it.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.357
Not easy

10:57.390 --> 10:58.792
staying behind
while other people head off

10:58.826 --> 11:00.360
into danger, is it?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.830
(sighs)

11:02.863 --> 11:04.898
Oh. Thanks.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.900
(indistinct chatter)

11:24.084 --> 11:26.453
Mr. Cooper.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.922
Kind of you to join me.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.390
I appreciate
you making the time.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.324
Beer?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.459
No, thank you.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.393
I'm having one.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.929
No offense,
but I'm here to do business,

11:35.963 --> 11:37.765
not to get buzzed.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.803
Tell me, how is it that life...

11:42.836 --> 11:45.405
brings you to this restaurant?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.075
Certainly
there were other things

11:48.108 --> 11:50.811
you could have chosen
to do with your life?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.013
Why this?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.414
My mother.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.284
So this is a family business.
No.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.787
But she always had
survival skills,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.955
and I've done my best
to learn from them.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.191
I knew from a young age,
if I was gonna get ahead,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.893
I have to pick
what game to play

12:05.926 --> 12:07.961
and figure out how to bend
the rules to my advantage.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.963
And you picked this one?
It picked me.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.865
Always dug cars.

12:11.899 --> 12:12.933
Love the adrenaline.

12:12.966 --> 12:13.834
RICHTER:
And how does

12:13.867 --> 12:15.735
your mother feel about that?
Hey, Jimmy.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.471
Wallace!

12:18.505 --> 12:20.140
Hey, man. How long's it been?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.844
Interesting meetup spot.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.145
I feel safer

12:25.178 --> 12:27.180
surrounded by L.A.'s finest.
Don't you?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.882
Depends on the circumstances.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.217
I suppose it does.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.321
You were just about to tell me

12:34.354 --> 12:36.556
if you and your mother
are still close.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.892
She died when I was 12.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.228
My father
finally got the better of her.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.864
But I still turn
to her for advice.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.133
She's still part of
every decision I make.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.068
So, in that sense,
yeah, we're close.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.441
If I provide transportation

12:54.474 --> 12:57.110
to the harbor,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.412
do you have a ship ready

12:59.446 --> 13:01.181
to receive your purchase?

13:01.214 --> 13:04.251
Absolutely.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.856
HONDO:
Well, damn.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.557
You bite that thing any harder,
it might just bite you back.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.360
(chuckles)

13:15.195 --> 13:16.529
I read your
Climbing Cadre evaluation.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.431
Nothing new, I just...

13:18.465 --> 13:19.432
just have to push myself

13:19.466 --> 13:21.001
harder next time.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.004
(plates clink)

13:25.072 --> 13:27.941
Deac.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.543
Says she alternated between

13:30.577 --> 13:32.212
indecision and recklessness.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.547
Took unnecessary risks.
Come on.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.016
We've seen her climb.
She's good.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.350
Yeah.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.086
You know this instructor
out of Metro,

13:39.119 --> 13:40.353
Tom Cole?
Sure.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.922
Yeah, he's tried out for SWAT
a couple times.

13:41.955 --> 13:42.923
He never made it.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.324
But he's always been cool to me.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.059
Feel him out, will you?
See if you can find out

13:46.093 --> 13:47.060
what happened on that wall.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.329
LUANNE:
Hondo?

13:49.362 --> 13:50.363
HONDO:
Luanne.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.299
Hey.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.600
What's up, kid?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.936
I'm glad you guys could make it.
Why don't I leave

13:55.969 --> 13:58.638
you two to catch up a bit?
All right, sounds good.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.307
I'll bring him home
when he gets sick of me.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.208
Thanks.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.976
Hey.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.211
You hungry?
Want something to eat?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.514
DEACON:
Raymont.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.615
I'm Deacon.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.151
It's an honor to meet you.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.485
If you ever need anything,
you got every officer

14:12.519 --> 14:14.087
in this department
at your service.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.929
You know you're lucky, right?

14:21.962 --> 14:24.965
I don't share my lunch
with just anybody.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.968
All right, so what's this

14:28.001 --> 14:30.003
about you maybe not
going to college?

14:30.037 --> 14:32.940
Just haven't decided yet.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.874
You know you want that.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.147
Raymont, you got the grades.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.415
Wasn't college always the plan?

14:43.951 --> 14:45.919
I get it,
you've been through a lot,

14:45.953 --> 14:47.420
and it takes time to adjust.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.057
But you can't let life's punches
knock you off track.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.658
They're not.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.661
You want to tell me
about the gun, then?

14:54.694 --> 14:57.464
She found it?

14:57.497 --> 14:58.598
Mm-hmm.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.603
Look, I know my mom
thinks you can help,

15:03.636 --> 15:06.373
but I don't need it. I'm good.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.008
You're a 17-year-old kid
sleeping with a loaded gun

15:08.041 --> 15:09.009
under your bed.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.111
It's all right to admit

15:11.144 --> 15:12.479
you're scared after being shot.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.613
That's got nothing to do
with it.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.015
So, what do you plan
on doing with the gun?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.249
Somebody giving you problems?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.619
(knocking at door)

15:19.652 --> 15:21.488
Street's back. The buy's
going down in two hours.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.622
Go ahead.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.092
I need to start my homework,
anyway.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.259
(sighs)

15:26.293 --> 15:28.695
To be continued.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.403
This is a scenario Richter's
played out a thousand times.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.504
The vehicles will arrive

15:37.537 --> 15:39.039
preloaded
in a shipping container,

15:39.072 --> 15:40.440
so we shouldn't have rabbits
in race cars.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.574
We need more time to plan this.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.709
Two hours is all I could get us.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.044
But Richter's in.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.945
This is our shot at him.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.548
All right, we cover the ins

15:48.581 --> 15:49.582
and outs.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.051
Chris, you're Sierra One here.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.120
Tan, Sierra Two here.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.321
HONDO:
You set up sniper positions,

15:54.354 --> 15:55.488
wait for my command.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.656
Deac, Luca.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.258
You're in the Charger here.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.326
I'll be on the ground
right here.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.061
We set up a code five
for the area.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.596
Mumford, you and your team
maintain a perimeter.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.198
Could use some unis
to tighten the net.
No.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.400
We can't take the chance
Richter spots them. We hold

16:07.434 --> 16:08.768
until Street makes the exchange.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.204
We go on my signal.
Any questions?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.739
How big a crew are we expecting?
STREET:
Minimal.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.107
Richter keeps things tight.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.475
Three, maybe four guys.
That said,

16:15.508 --> 16:16.743
it's risk management time.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.511
They are not gonna be
happy when they see us.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.546
Job one is getting

16:19.579 --> 16:21.414
Street out safe. Chris and Tan.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.482
You see any weapons

16:22.515 --> 16:23.483
swing his way, you take down

16:23.516 --> 16:24.517
whoever's got 'em.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
Understood.
Let's do this.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.067
(sighs)

17:06.226 --> 17:08.161
*

17:14.801 --> 17:17.104
RICHTER:
Weapons, phones.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.272
Anything with a chip, a blade

17:19.306 --> 17:21.308
or a trigger.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.410
Sweet ride.
Customized

17:23.443 --> 17:25.478
to make 840-horsepower.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.115
Not exactly street legal,

17:28.148 --> 17:29.682
so don't tell anyone.
I always dreamt

17:29.716 --> 17:32.185
of taking a car like that
out for a spin.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.255
You know, some things in life
are simply out of reach.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.529
Everything exactly as promised.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.097
And the payments?

17:44.131 --> 17:44.764
On my go.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.504
Luca, roll in!
Get in the car.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.806
LUCA:
Who the hell are these guys?
(driver screams)

17:53.840 --> 17:56.143
CHRIS: Some other crew's
shooting up the place.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.344
DEACON:
Richter's getting away
with Street.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.183
(grunting)

18:10.857 --> 18:13.560
Luca, you on Street?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.362
LUCA: Negative. I don't know
what he's got under that hood,

18:15.395 --> 18:17.230
but I lost him out of the lot.
Never had a chance.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.331
Mumford, anything?

18:18.365 --> 18:19.432
MUMFORD:
Negative, Hondo.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.767
Didn't come our way.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.206
The gunmen were Rosemead Mafia,

18:26.239 --> 18:27.707
part of the Chinese
crime syndicate.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.609
Best guess is Richter
was selling wheels to them

18:29.642 --> 18:31.478
before Street showed up
and squeezed them out.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.880
Mumford, coordinate
with Gang Task Force.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.316
Get me the Rosemead leader.
I'm also gonna find out

18:36.349 --> 18:37.584
who tipped them off
and if they know

18:37.617 --> 18:39.886
where Richter's hiding.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.222
Whatever it takes
to get our man back.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.656
Come on.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.725
We've also sent unis
to look for the crew

18:45.758 --> 18:47.560
Street was with when
they killed the trucker,

18:47.594 --> 18:48.561
see how they tie in.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.896
He launders money
through legit businesses,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.364
so we try and track him
through those.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.765
He moves a lot of stolen cars.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.033
If he held on to any,

18:54.066 --> 18:56.536
we might find him that way.
SIS is making a
list of vehicles

18:56.569 --> 18:57.837
they think he's
had his hands on.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.272
So, why aren't we wide
with this?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.707
Every cop in the city
looking for him.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.908
Far as we know,
his cover's holding.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.477
We go wide, it only takes one
cop in Richter's back pocket

19:04.511 --> 19:05.712
to expose Street.

19:05.745 --> 19:06.579
There are plenty of whispers

19:06.613 --> 19:07.914
about his connections
to the police.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.417
JESSICA:
They say we're the best.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.852
Time to prove it.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.721
STREET:
Just let me

19:14.754 --> 19:17.324
contact my people. I can prove
I had nothing to do with this.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.259
I have my own ways
of determining

19:19.292 --> 19:20.693
who's responsible, Mr. Cooper.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.295
DC:
Is he the reason
we're here?

19:22.329 --> 19:23.363
If Cooper screwed this up...

19:23.396 --> 19:24.664
RICHTER:
Shut up.

19:26.433 --> 19:26.933
Ten years,

19:26.966 --> 19:28.901
not one incident.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.937
And now Rosemead and cops
show up

19:30.970 --> 19:32.772
on the same deal?

19:32.805 --> 19:36.476
Until I connect the dots,
no one leaves.

19:39.412 --> 19:43.850
That mother you turn
to for guidance...

19:43.883 --> 19:46.619
what's her name?

19:46.653 --> 19:48.821
Alice.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.491
Your mother's name
is Alice Cooper?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.959
She was born before
the singer got famous.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.428
What do you care?
Maybe she can be of assistance.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.869
Say hello for me.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.804
Anything?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.606
If I had something,
I would've told you.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.481
I'm sorry.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.384
I'm sorry. We just keep
running into walls.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.886
Richter owns two shipment
companies, but the offices

20:19.919 --> 20:21.654
are in Miami and São Paulo.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.423
He's got no car registration,

20:23.456 --> 20:25.558
no local addresses...
Hey.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.430
Guy doesn't even file taxes
in California.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.798
No good news on my end, either.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.434
Metro can't locate
a single one of the crew

20:34.467 --> 20:36.035
that was with Street
when the trucker got killed.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.704
Richter's probably got 'em,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.472
trying to find the rat
who blew up his sale.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.574
At least that means
he doesn't suspect Street yet.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.811
And I am the one who's sorry.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.714
I sent him in
against your advice.
You trusted an officer

20:47.747 --> 20:49.816
to do his job. I'm the one
who lost him in the field.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.284
You walked into an ambush.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.985
It's my job to expect surprises.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.823
How are you holding up?

20:56.856 --> 21:00.327
I'm not too good at the sitting
and waiting thing.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.061
I saw a kid in the kitchen

21:02.094 --> 21:04.864
who's been lost in his homework
for the past few hours.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.499
He could use your help.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.812
Calculus, huh?
I'm working through the proof

21:19.846 --> 21:22.749
to V = 4/3 pi r squared.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.817
Volume of a sphere.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.355
I always loved math.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.323
English, I mean,
that class drove me crazy,

21:30.357 --> 21:32.825
but math was always...

21:32.859 --> 21:34.727
reliable.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.563
I like it, too.

21:45.838 --> 21:49.376
That's the same kind
as the one you took in the back.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.977
It's amazing
how something so tiny

21:51.010 --> 21:53.045
can cause so much damage.

21:53.079 --> 21:56.449
But carrying a gun doesn't
always make you safer, Raymont.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.651
In fact, the opposite is true.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.453
You carry one.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.788
And I get shot at a lot, too.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.993
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

22:07.026 --> 22:08.795
It's not your job
to fix me, okay?

22:11.764 --> 22:14.434
Just let me do my homework.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.107
Tommy Cole.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.675
How you been?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.076
Hey, Deac.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.812
Just congratulating Baker here

22:25.845 --> 22:28.014
on his climbing certification.
Well done, Baker.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.949
I hear Cole's tough
on you guys out there.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.618
Yeah, he puts us
through our paces.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.785
I got to run.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.556
Good kid.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.458
Could lead his own team one day.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.693
If they ever get back to giving
20-Davids to guys like him.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.595
Well, time will tell.
You know,

22:42.629 --> 22:44.731
a lot of us don't think
what they did to you was right.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.466
Promotion
should have been yours.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.735
I appreciate that,
but, uh, I'm doing okay.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.803
For what it's worth,
I feel your pain.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.505
Most of the officers

22:52.539 --> 22:54.073
that were promoted to SWAT
over me?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.975
Let's just say
they check all the right boxes

22:56.008 --> 22:57.043
in the mayor's office.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.846
Hmm. So, uh, what happened

22:59.879 --> 23:01.581
to my girl out there?
Saw you dinged her.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.115
She had a shot.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.851
She took too many chances
on the wall

23:04.884 --> 23:06.786
trying to make up
for physical limitations.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.755
They want me
to grade everybody

23:08.788 --> 23:09.956
on the same scale, so...

23:09.989 --> 23:11.157
But she passed Explosive Breach

23:11.190 --> 23:12.592
and Sniper Cadres just fine.

23:12.625 --> 23:13.660
Pulling triggers

23:13.693 --> 23:15.027
and setting bombs doesn't call

23:15.061 --> 23:16.496
for the same physicality.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.697
You know what I mean?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.666
Look, I don't get to wear

23:19.699 --> 23:21.067
the SWAT uniform like you do,

23:21.100 --> 23:22.735
but that doesn't mean
I don't do what I can

23:22.769 --> 23:25.171
to protect what it stands for.
Right?

23:29.241 --> 23:32.144
Right.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.548
Bad news.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.552
It appears one of you
is not who you claim to be.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.054
The spirits sensed it

23:42.088 --> 23:44.524
and I confirmed it.

23:44.557 --> 23:48.461
Dennis "Double Clutch" Collins.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.762
San Dimas High School

23:49.796 --> 23:51.998
class of '08.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.066
And Katrina Fisk,

23:54.100 --> 23:57.637
the 2009 Miss Teen San Gabriel.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.839
What a lovely couple.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.143
Luke Denning.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.046
Expelled from Berkeley
for hacking the school server

24:07.079 --> 24:09.749
and changing grades.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.485
He had a full ride, too.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.487
Mr. Cooper.

24:14.521 --> 24:17.790
Our newcomer.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.527
According to the records

24:20.560 --> 24:23.496
of Mercer High School
in Trenton, New Jersey,

24:23.530 --> 24:25.832
you dropped out

24:25.865 --> 24:28.100
in tenth grade.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.670
You never told me
you were a dropout.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.841
I couldn't find
your mother, though.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.609
She liked living off the grid.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.814
Which leaves...

24:41.848 --> 24:45.217
Mr. Huntley.

24:45.251 --> 24:49.255
You know, there are
15 Ben Huntleys in the country,

24:49.288 --> 24:51.290
and not one of them is you.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.893
I knifed a guy
in a bar fight when I was 19.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.795
I-I was facing more time
than I could handle,

24:55.828 --> 24:56.996
so I jumped bail.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.565
I-I've been Ben Huntley
ever since.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.601
I swear I had nothing to
do with any of this.

25:01.634 --> 25:04.904
But who am I actually looking at

25:04.937 --> 25:06.038
right now?

25:06.072 --> 25:07.607
HUNTLEY:
Kevin Barnes. From Phoenix.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.208
RICHTER:
I sure wish

25:09.241 --> 25:11.678
you hadn't lied to me...

25:11.711 --> 25:13.580
Kevin Barnes

25:13.613 --> 25:14.747
from Phoenix.
Please.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.082
I swear I had nothing...
(chokes)

25:16.115 --> 25:17.917
A liar is a liar...

25:17.950 --> 25:20.820
(wheezes)
Kevin.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.722
Anyone else have a secret

25:22.755 --> 25:24.791
they would like to share?

25:24.824 --> 25:26.325
'Cause I still have a lot

25:26.358 --> 25:28.060
of unanswered questions.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.867
It's the list of cars
SIS thinks Richter stole.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.068
But they all went dark
the day they were heisted

25:36.102 --> 25:37.069
and never came back on.
OnStar,

25:37.103 --> 25:38.070
LoJack, all that on alert?

25:38.104 --> 25:40.973
TAN:
Yep.
Anything?

25:41.007 --> 25:43.743
HONDO:
Nothing but crickets.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.778
So, I ran into
our friend Cole.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.014
He's, uh, pretty old-school.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.916
I don't think he's a fan
of women in SWAT.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.784
He said that?
Well, he let it be known

25:51.818 --> 25:53.285
in his own way.
HONDO: He's still
in the building?

25:53.319 --> 25:56.656
What are you guys talking about?

25:56.689 --> 25:57.356
I asked Deacon

25:57.389 --> 25:59.626
to look into your climbing eval.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.961
Look, I don't think Cole
gave you a very fair shake

26:01.994 --> 26:03.362
out on that wall.
No way.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.897
Next you'll tell me
there's no Santa Claus?

26:04.931 --> 26:06.065
HONDO:
Don't worry about it.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.299
I'm gonna have
a little chat with him.
You mean, like,

26:07.333 --> 26:10.102
man-to-man? Tell him to stop
picking on little girls, right?

26:10.136 --> 26:11.771
He misevaluated
a member of my team,

26:11.804 --> 26:13.105
and I'm not having that.
How do you know?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.373
You weren't there.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.842
You think I'm not used
to this game?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.109
I don't need him to tell me

26:17.143 --> 26:18.711
what I'm capable of,
and the last thing I want

26:18.745 --> 26:20.647
is him thinking that
I came crying to you about it.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.381
She's right.
Confidence is silent.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.983
Insecurity is loud.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.052
See? The shrink gets it.
All right,

26:26.085 --> 26:27.186
I hear you, I do.

26:27.219 --> 26:30.723
In my hood, we used to say
"real Gs move in silence."

26:30.757 --> 26:32.859
I'm just not sure this is the
right time for all that, Wendy.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.593
I got your message
about the boy.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.631
Trauma like he went through
affects brain chemistry.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.200
It reduces cortisol levels,
hippocampal volumes.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.002
He's wrestling with a lot.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.737
Are you saying he
needs medication?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.305
Not necessarily.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.875
If he can recognize the symptoms
and face them head-on,

26:48.908 --> 26:51.878
his brain should recover
back to baseline on its own.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.646
He's pretty closed up about it.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.882
Do you mind if I introduce you,
let you feel him out a bit?

26:55.915 --> 26:57.884
Well, I got no cops
with daddy issues

26:57.917 --> 27:00.019
until tomorrow morning, so sure.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.655
Come on.
(chuckles)

27:08.194 --> 27:08.961
Raymont.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.362
I want to introduce you

27:10.396 --> 27:12.965
to an old friend of mine.
Hi, I'm Wendy.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.901
Listen, I'm gonna be
caught up for a while,

27:14.934 --> 27:17.036
but Wendy here
has PS4 in her office.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.771
Says you can use it.
I play a pretty mean

27:18.805 --> 27:21.340
NBA 2K if you're interested.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.342
You like a therapist
or something?
Guys around here

27:23.375 --> 27:25.845
need someone to talk to
every now and then.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.446
I mostly just listen.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.848
I don't need a head doctor.

27:28.881 --> 27:29.882
HONDO:
I ain't saying you do.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.318
Wendy's the only one
with 2K, so...

27:32.351 --> 27:34.186
take it or leave it.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.321
Hondo.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.390
Got you a present.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.993
Leader of the Rosemead Mafia.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.731
Hey.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.866
I got ten bucks says
you can't beat her.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.707
I found this punk
at his sister's.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.275
Wasn't exactly hiding, either.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.344
Was arming his crew for battle.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.312
Getting ready
for when Richter comes?

28:00.346 --> 28:02.014
No idea what you're
talking about.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.315
Look, man, you can play stupid

28:03.349 --> 28:04.984
if you want to,
but you better understand

28:05.017 --> 28:06.819
that Richter's
not gonna come at you head-on.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.087
MUMFORD: You sent shooters
to try and kill him.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.355
HONDO:
You pissed him off.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.257
He's gonna want
to make you hurt.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.125
He'll go after your family.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.028
How many kids you got?

28:16.062 --> 28:17.196
Or did God do everyone a favor

28:17.229 --> 28:18.330
and make you sterile?

28:18.364 --> 28:19.398
HONDO:
Tell you what.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.800
You help me find Richter,

28:20.833 --> 28:21.968
I'll take him out for you.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.335
Or we can just wait

28:23.369 --> 28:25.437
till he slaughters you
and all your loved ones.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.808
Either way, I get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.109
We know you and your boys
crashed his buy.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.078
Now, how'd you find out
about it?

28:34.981 --> 28:36.949
Off the record?

28:36.983 --> 28:40.252
This ebony-ivory couple

28:40.286 --> 28:41.520
comes to me this morning

28:41.553 --> 28:43.990
saying they source for Richter

28:44.023 --> 28:45.858
but they'd rather do
business with me.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.994
I tell 'em to get lost,

28:48.027 --> 28:50.496
but then they say Richter's
planning to cut me out.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.364
Say he's dealing
with some new guy.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.500
Cooper.
Okay, so, what's the deal?

28:54.533 --> 28:56.002
You take Richter
and the newbie out,

28:56.035 --> 28:57.303
and they start
sourcing cars for you?

28:57.336 --> 28:58.537
I thought they were full of it,

28:58.570 --> 29:00.106
but the details tracked, so...

29:00.139 --> 29:01.440
Tracked how?

29:01.473 --> 29:03.776
Same MO and same part of town

29:03.810 --> 29:05.144
as the deals I made
with Richter.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.847
Santa Fe Springs, Pico Rivera.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.448
Richter got a place out there?

29:09.481 --> 29:11.283
He's got a spot he calls
the Templo,

29:11.317 --> 29:12.919
but no one's seen it.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.520
Or, if they do,

29:14.553 --> 29:17.156
they never make it back
to talk about it.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.431
(choking)

29:30.602 --> 29:33.339
I'm guessing none of this
is what you signed up for?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.274
Is he gonna do that to us, too?
Want the truth,

29:35.307 --> 29:36.843
or you want a bedtime story?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.345
Unless we find a way
out of here,

29:39.378 --> 29:40.512
we're all gonna die.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.150
Okay, what do we do?

29:44.183 --> 29:45.918
Start by calming down.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.453
You should tell me
how you got the name "Whip."

29:47.486 --> 29:49.055
My brother.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.823
He used to make me
do his homework.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.458
He'd say, "Come on,

29:52.491 --> 29:53.425
"you're smart as a whip.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.327
Whip it out.
Whip out that homework, Whip."

29:55.361 --> 29:56.495
He sounds annoying.
Yeah.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.197
He is.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.466
But he looks out for me.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.335
Even told me hooking up
with this bunch was a bad idea.

30:03.369 --> 30:04.904
I never had a big brother,

30:04.937 --> 30:06.205
but I got this guy I work with,

30:06.238 --> 30:07.940
likes to act like one.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.942
I get the feeling
he's not too crazy

30:09.976 --> 30:12.845
about me getting into
this whole mess, either.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.914
You know what he'd say
if he was here?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.348
That you should have
finished high school?

30:16.382 --> 30:17.950
That I should trust my gut.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.952
And right now my gut tells me

30:19.986 --> 30:22.288
that you're the only one
who can get us out of here.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.959
See that car
at the end of the building?

30:26.993 --> 30:29.461
There's a GPS unit, yeah?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.630
Any way to hack it?
Get a message out?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.332
Not like an e-mail.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.368
But there should be
a built-in distress signal.

30:36.402 --> 30:39.171
You get the car back on line,
activate the signal.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.407
But someone
has to be looking for it.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.609
Someone's looking.
How long would it take?

30:43.642 --> 30:44.776
You serious about trying this?

30:44.810 --> 30:47.646
I'm gonna tell you something
that could get me killed.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.381
But if you trust me,
I can get us

30:49.415 --> 30:51.017
both out of here in one piece.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.251
It was you?

30:52.284 --> 30:54.420
You tipped off
the Rosemead Mafia?

30:54.453 --> 30:56.388
I'm pretty sure it was them.
They had the most to gain,

30:56.422 --> 30:58.557
and they've been acting guilty
this whole time.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.426
How do you know that?
'Cause I'm a cop.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.963
Those police
that were there today,

31:03.996 --> 31:05.932
they were with me.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.533
I'm SWAT.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.568
Now, you can blow my cover

31:09.601 --> 31:12.271
and watch me die,

31:12.304 --> 31:14.306
or you can help me
get us out of here.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.212
Okay.

31:22.314 --> 31:25.617
Be ready to move.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.156
You know I'm gonna have your ass
for getting me into this, right?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.190
What did you say?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.258
You're the one who sicced

31:32.291 --> 31:33.225
those Rosemead punks onto us.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.994
You wanted Richter's business
all to yourself.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.195
You better shut your mouth, son.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.097
Tell me it isn't true.
I'm not dying here

31:38.130 --> 31:39.398
for a couple of double-crossers.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.967
(both grunting)

31:49.041 --> 31:51.043
Enough.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.244
STREET:
I want to see Richter.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.980
These two are the rats.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.147
Say that again
and I'll kill you.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.082
Sit down and shut up.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.252
Where's the kid?

32:03.089 --> 32:04.523
We can thank Mumford

32:04.556 --> 32:06.292
for our first good lead
on finding Street.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.527
Just want the kid back.
Miss giving him crap.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.196
These dots are where
Richter made the deals

32:10.229 --> 32:11.597
with the Rosemead Mafia.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.632
His Temp ought to be
somewhere around here.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.367
Any of that paperwork link
to buildings in this area?

32:15.401 --> 32:17.736
Don't think it has to.
One of, uh, Richter's cars

32:17.769 --> 32:20.372
just came back on line,
and it's right here.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.740
Right in the middle
of the hot zone.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.109
Let's go get him.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.452
All right, we got three loading
docks flanked by service doors

32:33.485 --> 32:35.754
along the front wall.
One dock with a ramp.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.324
No points of entry
on the other sides.
Means we got to go in hot.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.059
HONDO:
And blind.
CHRIS: I could scale it,

32:40.092 --> 32:42.194
drop in through one of the
skylights, get eyes in there.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.730
It's a 30-foot wall.
No gear, no harness.
And?

32:44.763 --> 32:47.199
Unless you agree
with Officer Cole.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.072
(guttural grunting)

32:54.173 --> 32:56.042
I found him hiding
behind your car.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.611
So much deceit.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.648
It's impossible
to separate the lies.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.753
And so,

33:07.786 --> 33:10.056
I've made my decision.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.094
Equal punishment...

33:15.127 --> 33:16.995
for all.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.672
(guttural grunting)

33:28.140 --> 33:30.576
(grunts)

33:30.609 --> 33:33.345
(grunting)

33:34.780 --> 33:37.249
RICHTER:
You were just gonna

33:37.283 --> 33:40.152
drive off in my car?!

33:42.188 --> 33:44.456
I made him do it.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.458
Told him the car
was bulletproof,

33:46.492 --> 33:48.394
if he got it started,
we could bust out of here.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.762
Kid's innocent. He
doesn't belong here.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.698
(grunting)

33:52.731 --> 33:55.167
(loud grunting)

33:55.201 --> 33:57.269
You disappoint me, Mr. Cooper,

33:57.303 --> 33:59.838
roping in a child
to do your dirty work.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.441
That earns you
special treatment.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.176
(panting)

34:04.210 --> 34:05.777
(grunts)

34:05.811 --> 34:10.449
You won't believe how much
that hurts in a minute.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.590
He's just a scared kid. He had
nothing to do with any of this.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.195
Hey!

34:23.229 --> 34:25.131
(coughing)
They did.

34:26.832 --> 34:31.470
In position.
On my go.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.172
You have proof?

34:33.205 --> 34:34.240
Hell, no!

34:35.741 --> 34:37.576
STREET: I know you're
gonna kill us all.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.178
Just don't start
with the kid.

34:39.211 --> 34:41.213
(whispers):
Please.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.252
As you wish.

34:47.486 --> 34:48.887
(mouths)

34:48.920 --> 34:50.856
(coughing)

34:50.889 --> 34:53.725
(grunts)
CHRIS:
Luca, go!

34:53.759 --> 34:54.593
(grunting)

34:54.626 --> 34:56.195
(engine revving)

34:58.630 --> 35:00.566
LAPD SWAT.
Get down!

35:00.599 --> 35:02.468
Whoa! Police!
Hold it right there!

35:02.501 --> 35:03.869
Get down!
(gunshot)

35:03.902 --> 35:05.204
Get down!
(groans)

35:06.905 --> 35:08.607
SWAT! Get down!

35:12.511 --> 35:15.281
(grunting)

35:17.516 --> 35:18.917
(grunting)

35:18.950 --> 35:20.886
Stay right there.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.489
(grunting)

35:27.293 --> 35:28.627
(wheezing)

35:28.660 --> 35:32.298
(gasps, pants)

35:32.331 --> 35:33.765
Owe you one, buddy.
30-David to Command.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.434
CHRIS:
Street.
All secured.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.137
(panting):
Hey.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.242
(panting)

35:52.918 --> 35:55.387
(applause and cheering,
whistling)

36:01.427 --> 36:03.762
Hey.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.163
Good job.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.469
Nice to see you back
in one piece.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.903
Yeah, kid tried to
get himself killed.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.572
Couldn't even
do that right.
Give him time.

36:14.706 --> 36:15.874
Hey, here's our friend
Officer Cole.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.443
Want me to talk to
him, tell him how

36:17.476 --> 36:18.844
Chris kicked ass today?

36:18.877 --> 36:20.412
Nah, he's a
waste of breath.

36:20.446 --> 36:21.747
He's on my
list, though.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.249
He'll be seeing
me soon enough.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.516
Congrats.

36:24.550 --> 36:28.987
Hey, uh, Richter's
high-end rides--

36:29.020 --> 36:31.490
when are they getting
transferred to the impound lot?

36:31.523 --> 36:32.691
Tomorrow morning.
Why?

36:32.724 --> 36:35.694
I just want to get
a couple pictures.

36:35.727 --> 36:38.397
On a cop's salary, it's probably
as close to one of those

36:38.430 --> 36:39.898
as I'm ever gonna
get, you know?

36:39.931 --> 36:41.667
DEACON:
Hey, boot?

36:41.700 --> 36:42.834
You might want
to hit the ATM.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.503
You're gonna buy
a few rounds tonight.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.639
LUCA:
Yeah! Get to it!
(applause)

36:47.673 --> 36:48.707
You got it!

36:48.740 --> 36:49.575
All right.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.976
Get over here.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.479
(laughing)

36:54.880 --> 36:57.449
You got him back.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.851
Thanks for making me look
like a good captain.

36:59.885 --> 37:03.422
Richter wouldn't be in jail
if you hadn't made that call.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.357
Thanks for trusting my team.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.671
How'd you get that shot off?
I always block those.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.607
You're too
aggressive on D.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.477
I just Eurostep.
Double-tap X, no turbo.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.012
Come on now, Wendy. Don't tell
me you're letting the kid win.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.880
Didn't warn me
he's a hustler.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.549
Sorry I left you
hanging so long.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.484
You owe me ten bucks.
Okay.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.886
Grab your stuff.
I got to get you home.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.523
You owe me a rematch.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.461
You know you shouldn't be
beating up on girls.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.635
Hmm.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.936
You learn anything?

37:50.969 --> 37:52.971
He's got a lot
going on inside.

37:53.004 --> 37:56.074
Trouble is, he thinks that's
where it's supposed to stay.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.944
You know, he kind of
reminds me of someone.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.380
Real Gs move in silence, right?

38:01.413 --> 38:03.682
Touché.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.485
I appreciate you
taking the time.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.695
(sighs)

38:16.728 --> 38:18.530
Awfully quiet over there.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.467
You have a good
talk with Wendy?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.402
Nah, we just played.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.671
Said you've known each other
a long time, though.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.873
That we have.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.775
She helped me through
a really rough time

38:29.808 --> 38:31.443
when I was new
to the force.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.745
What happened?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.048
I didn't start
out in SWAT.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.418
Nobody does.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.753
First few years in uniform,
you got to pay a lot of dues.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.022
Spend a lot of hours
in a squad car,

38:44.055 --> 38:47.726
and you write a
gang of tickets.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.061
But I was pretty lucky 'cause...

38:50.095 --> 38:52.798
I got to ride around
with one of the funniest cats

38:52.831 --> 38:55.467
this world has ever known--
my partner Robbie.

38:55.501 --> 38:56.735
(laughs)

38:56.768 --> 38:58.136
I mean, this dude...

38:58.169 --> 38:59.938
This dude could make you laugh.

38:59.971 --> 39:04.109
He'd make you laugh
on your worst day.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.778
One day, we were writing
citations on Venice Boulevard.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.648
We had a guy pulled
over for expired tags.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.618
Trust me, that's the type of
thing every cop hates doing.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.123
Robbie was at the
driver's side window.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.626
I was at the passenger rear.

39:23.795 --> 39:27.032
And this black truck...

39:27.065 --> 39:30.602
just came flying into the
right lane and hit Robbie.

39:30.636 --> 39:33.071
Clipped him at
60 miles an hour.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.773
He die?

39:34.806 --> 39:37.443
Right in front of me.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.847
Raymont, you wear
a gun and a badge,

39:41.880 --> 39:43.815
you expect to be
in danger, but...

39:43.849 --> 39:45.851
we were just
writing tickets.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.886
So, did you get
the guy in the truck?

39:47.919 --> 39:49.821
No.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.957
He got away?

39:51.990 --> 39:54.460
And that haunted me.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.829
So what did you do?

39:57.863 --> 39:59.798
I suffered...

39:59.831 --> 40:02.601
till it damn near broke me.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.803
But then I did
the one thing

40:04.836 --> 40:09.040
that guys like you and me
are taught to never do.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.543
I asked for help.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.412
Wendy's the one
who gave it to me.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.588
I have dreams
where I never make it.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.994
I'm just lying there
on the street, shot.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.563
Bleeding.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.801
And I know I'm gonna die.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.672
That's why I got the gun.

40:40.706 --> 40:44.576
It just feels safe
to have it there,

40:44.610 --> 40:47.513
and I don't want to die.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.653
Wendy used to tell me
that the pieces

40:54.686 --> 40:57.088
that were hurting inside
worked like broken bones.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.457
(door squeaks open)

41:05.597 --> 41:08.934
If you treat 'em
right, they'll heal.

41:08.967 --> 41:13.705
If you don't, that pain's
only gonna get worse.

41:13.739 --> 41:18.243
I'm not sure I'm up for
sitting around with a shrink.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.513
How about sitting around
with me from time to time?

41:24.282 --> 41:25.984
Okay.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.120
Yeah?

41:29.154 --> 41:31.657
Okay.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.995
Hey,

41:37.028 --> 41:39.497
go hug your mom.

42:09.761 --> 42:12.030
(door opens)

42:14.633 --> 42:16.935
(engine idling)

42:18.970 --> 42:20.739
(rock music plays)

42:20.772 --> 42:23.041
(engine revving)

42:23.074 --> 42:25.844
(engine revving loudly)

42:25.877 --> 42:28.246
(laughs, whoops)

42:28.279 --> 42:30.782
Nothing's out of reach,
you cocky son of a...

42:30.816 --> 42:32.250
(engine revving)

42:32.283 --> 42:34.620
(laughing)
