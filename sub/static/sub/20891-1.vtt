00:43.610 --> 00:45.711
I got nothin'.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.950
Was that a kid?

00:55.122 --> 00:57.890
I thought our ghost
was an escaped convict.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.291
It is.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.838
It's blood.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.306
Oh, Jesus.

01:15.708 --> 01:16.975
Is it yours?

01:16.977 --> 01:18.210
No.

01:35.462 --> 01:36.929
Hamlet.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.164
Hamlet, come on.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.853
Uh, guys?

02:00.855 --> 02:02.988
Shh, Chad.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.628
It's a projection.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.661
What the shit?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.496
Can I help you?

02:47.767 --> 02:50.269
There's no
such thing as ghosts.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.837
Just cruddy old perverts,

02:51.839 --> 02:53.772
politicians,
and real estate developers.

02:55.475 --> 02:59.077
When we first got together,
we hunted ghosts.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.813
Sometimes aliens,
moss monsters,

03:01.815 --> 03:03.749
the occasional scary robot.

03:03.751 --> 03:08.120
Now we know what we're
really after is people...

03:08.122 --> 03:09.955
people with something to hide.

03:09.957 --> 03:14.793
People who want everyone
to think there are ghosts.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.361
My best friend Gwen and I

03:16.363 --> 03:19.097
co-founded the gang
our freshman year at Oberlin.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.366
She's a great partner
in business,

03:21.368 --> 03:24.069
and an even better partner
in fighting crime.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.938
Chad's our sound guy,

03:25.940 --> 03:27.739
and he also brings the van.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.107
He's the only one of us

03:29.109 --> 03:30.709
who actually believes
in the paranormal,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.744
so he's probably great
to have around

03:32.746 --> 03:36.148
in case we ever
find something real.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.717
Before we found him,
Floyd repaired robots

03:38.719 --> 03:41.520
at a haunted Showbiz Pizza
in Seattle.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.723
Now he's the rocking-est
resident gearhead

03:44.725 --> 03:46.291
a girl could ask for.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.460
Hamlet's his dog.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.829
Part Great Dane,
part something else,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.265
and all affection.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.033
He's the muscle.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.735
And I'm Nancy,

03:56.737 --> 04:00.405
just a few months shy of getting
my private detective's license,

04:00.407 --> 04:03.842
and already years
into debunking shady shit.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.190
We rip off the masks

04:18.192 --> 04:21.426
so the authorities
can slap on the cuffs.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.562
We're really good.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.098
We get to the bottom of things.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.800
Just ask these assholes...

04:28.802 --> 04:31.003
on visitors day...

04:31.005 --> 04:33.005
at the pen...

04:33.007 --> 04:34.973
in Huntsville.

04:34.975 --> 04:39.878
So, you think you busted up
a kiddy-porn ring, huh?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.546
We're so glad
you guys got here
when you did.

04:41.548 --> 04:44.149
The situation here was,
these guys had a cover story

04:44.151 --> 04:45.250
of a dead convict
haunting the place.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.718
Totally fake.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.387
We even bought high-8
and actually record the ghosts.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.155
We can surrender
those to you, if you want.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.591
They were
scaring everybody away
from ever coming in,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.359
so that nobody was finding out
what they were doing.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.994
Shut the fuck up!

04:55.996 --> 04:58.230
We've had this
staked out for months.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.765
Fuckin' months.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.401
We have videotape of them
bringing in the kids.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.935
Officer, we have...

05:03.937 --> 05:06.138
We have wiretaps!

05:06.140 --> 05:08.273
We were building a case.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.343
You waltz in
and fuck it all up.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.477
What do you think this is,

05:12.479 --> 05:14.012
some Saturday morning
cartoon show?

05:15.049 --> 05:16.281
I don't watch television.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.449
We're just doing our jobs.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.684
We're paranormal investigators.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.118
Oh, so you're Ghostbusters.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.454
You know what happens
to real detectives?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.189
They get killed!

05:24.191 --> 05:28.193
Listen, we got in there
before anything happened
to those kids, okay?

05:28.195 --> 05:29.961
Nothing happened to them
because of us.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.296
Yeah, where were you guys?

05:31.298 --> 05:32.631
Whoa, you didn't do shit
but taint evidence

05:32.633 --> 05:34.099
and fuck our investigation.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.635
These guys are gonna be
out before happy hour,

05:36.637 --> 05:38.370
probably at the carnival,
in line at the Zipper,

05:38.372 --> 05:41.039
if you know what I mean.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.375
What, are you trying to get
in touch with your inner child?

05:43.377 --> 05:46.011
Fuck your inner child.

05:51.818 --> 05:56.388
So I can call my parents again
and get a loan for us at 15%,

05:56.390 --> 05:57.989
but we haven't paid off
the last one yet.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.358
You still owe me money

05:59.360 --> 06:00.992
for one of those installments,
by the way.

06:00.994 --> 06:01.993
Do you guys think that that was

06:01.995 --> 06:03.495
cow's blood in there?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.030
It was pig's blood,
or something, you know?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.231
This is just total crap.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.466
And who does that?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.467
And you...
And you licked it.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.501
How were we supposed to know

06:09.503 --> 06:11.370
it was a sting operation, okay?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.271
I mean, what the hell?
It's total crap, right?

06:13.273 --> 06:15.173
Right?
It's total crap?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.775
Yes, it's total crap.
Yes.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.009
- Yes.
- It is total crap.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.111
Are we talking about the blood,

06:19.113 --> 06:20.545
or are we talking about...

06:20.547 --> 06:21.880
I think we're talking
about the situation.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.548
No, we're talking
about what happened today.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.716
Did you hear the way
those cops were
talking to us,

06:24.718 --> 06:26.551
like we were juveniles
or something?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.053
Well...
They weren't very nice.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.388
You save the kids
from pedophiles,

06:29.390 --> 06:30.555
and you don't
even get paid for it.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.157
How would you make
that sustainable?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.425
Well, I was thinking that maybe

06:33.427 --> 06:34.526
we should refine
our business model.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.794
That's a good idea.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.196
Okay, I agree,
but what do we do?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.798
I mean, how do we figure
out a way to?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.267
Nance, you have to look
on the bright side.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.435
We'll figure it out.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.970
I can call my parents anytime.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.139
No.
Remember that
department store job?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.709
I could work at the pool again.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.978
- Hello?
- Oh, Nancy.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.180
This is Mike Ryan from
Buford National Bank.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.481
Hi.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.949
Uh, calling about
our haunted house.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.950
Yes...

06:58.952 --> 07:02.521
It is potentially a paying job.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.623
By all means.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.925
All right, sir, I'm
gonna work on this.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.461
You have pig blood
all over you.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.163
We don't know
if it's pig blood.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.831
Ooh, you know what,
I didn't tell you
this, but...

07:12.833 --> 07:15.133
I don't have my period anymore.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.201
Oh, really?

07:16.203 --> 07:17.602
That's great.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.904
Do you think you can do
that for that price?

07:18.906 --> 07:20.338
Yeah, absolutely.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.174
Nancy, that would
be really terrific,

07:22.176 --> 07:24.242
'cause, you know,
this ghost stuff,
you would not believe.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.410
It's just...

07:25.412 --> 07:26.678
We've seen some crazy stuff.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.713
Yeah, I mean, okay.
Can I ask you one thing?

07:28.715 --> 07:31.817
Um, this place is...
It's really bad, and,

07:31.819 --> 07:34.953
um, it's not like
I believe in ghosts
or anything like that,

07:34.955 --> 07:36.855
but you do have a...

07:36.857 --> 07:39.024
You do have
a contingency plan, right,

07:39.026 --> 07:41.293
just in case...

07:41.295 --> 07:42.494
Oh, no worries.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.095
I mean, we'll figure it out,

07:44.097 --> 07:45.363
whatever it is.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.466
Okay, great, 'cause, you know,

07:47.468 --> 07:48.567
you'd literally
be saving my life.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.068
Yeah.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.169
Shut up.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.437
Well, well.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.806
You guys want to be alone?

07:54.808 --> 07:55.640
Hello.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.942
What are you doin', buddy?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.844
What are you guys doing?
Just hanging out.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.479
Creepy.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.713
Um, were you just hanging out

08:01.715 --> 08:03.482
with the busboy out there?

08:03.484 --> 08:06.485
Who's your new friend?

08:06.487 --> 08:08.653
So I was stuck in this place
for four weeks.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.422
My face is peeling,
I can't take a shit.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.157
Okay.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.092
But it's cool, 'cause I'm
taking like 18 pills a day.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.227
Mm-hmm.

08:15.229 --> 08:16.561
18 pills a day...

08:16.563 --> 08:17.462
Look, I'm sorry.
Your card was declined.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.730
I tried it a couple times.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.265
It'd be like
I'm on the tit, right?

08:20.267 --> 08:21.700
- 'Cause it's for cash.
- Okay.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.435
That's great.
Yes.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.736
That's great. I can't
guarantee anything,

08:24.738 --> 08:25.770
but if you can put it to rest

08:25.772 --> 08:27.506
by the end of the weekend,

08:27.508 --> 08:29.875
I might be able to
work out a little bonus
for you, okay?

08:29.877 --> 08:33.078
That would be fantastic.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.113
Okay, okay, so
tomorrow we'll see you.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.280
Tomorrow.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.381
6:30, meet me
at the house?

08:37.384 --> 08:38.650
We can absolutely do that.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.118
Great. See you then.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.488
Bye.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.723
Bye.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.958
Did you have a good call?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.628
Do you think every place
is your house?

08:51.964 --> 08:53.098
Help me.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.633
Those are like the kind of jobs

08:54.635 --> 08:55.800
that you're
not supposed to take,

08:55.802 --> 08:57.402
and you always take those jobs.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.071
I need money,
or you can't take a shit.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.473
But I couldn't... Okay!

09:01.475 --> 09:03.341
So you hustled?
You hustled, right?

09:03.343 --> 09:04.509
I hustled.
Yeah?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.044
Yeah?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.146
- Oh!
- Yeah!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.616
No, I'm not gonna work
here no more, man.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.784
What are you worried
about, Pedro?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.519
They're coming
this weekend, man.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.954
They're gonna prove
that there's no ghosts.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.056
Naw, Man.
Exterminados fantasmos, man!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.424
I'm not working here anymore.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.559
This house is fucked up, bro.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.227
What?
Come on.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.106
Hey! Pedro!

09:35.108 --> 09:37.509
Come on, man! Please!

09:38.778 --> 09:40.478
No more chupacabra,

09:40.480 --> 09:42.681
no more spirito,
no more diablo.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.884
Pedro!

09:45.886 --> 09:47.752
Manuel?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.554
Javier.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.256
Shit!

10:02.068 --> 10:03.501
All right.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.437
All right, you're
gonna be that way.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.538
Be that way.

All right.
Old Kyser place,
let's talk about it.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.055
Um, it was built in 1913.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.325
There's been a history
of some reported
Satanic activity

11:00.327 --> 11:01.559
going on over the years.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.727
Cult rituals,
that sort of thing.

11:02.729 --> 11:03.795
What kind of Satanists?

11:03.797 --> 11:06.965
Aleister Crowley
or Anton Lavey?

11:06.967 --> 11:09.934
Uh, I don't think the bank's hip
to that sort of thing, Gwen.

11:09.936 --> 11:13.104
Um, it sat vacant
for a little while

11:13.106 --> 11:15.306
till the bank hired
some maintenance crews

11:15.308 --> 11:16.408
and construction guys,

11:16.410 --> 11:17.809
but they keep
getting scared away

11:17.811 --> 11:19.377
because of all the weird stuff
that's going on.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.479
Did they order
a full package
or a half package?

11:21.481 --> 11:22.947
Full package, baby.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.683
Yeah. That's
my little saleslady.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.619
- What's wrong, Chad?
- Are you scared?

11:27.621 --> 11:29.187
No, I'm just...

11:29.189 --> 11:31.356
I'm having a little trouble
with the accelerator.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.058
Is that what that noise is?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.926
Did you touch the accelerator?

11:34.928 --> 11:38.029
No, I changed the oil
and put, uh,
antifreeze in it.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.864
I didn't ask you
to change the antifreeze,

11:39.866 --> 11:42.400
because it's
an air-cooled engine.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.403
I...

11:45.405 --> 11:46.604
Equipment, what do we got?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.707
Um, we got tapes,

11:48.709 --> 11:50.775
but we need a shitload
of nine-volts though...

11:50.777 --> 11:52.744
It sorta...
It smells weird.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.945
Chad, what are you doing?

11:53.947 --> 11:55.313
Yeah, well, we gotta pull over.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.715
There's something wrong
with the car.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.183
Hold on, we gotta pull over.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.517
Where are we?

11:59.519 --> 12:01.086
Wait, we're stopping here?

12:11.097 --> 12:12.831
Ah, I hate this.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.871
Shit.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.175
I changed this.
It's antifreeze.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.643
You, you put the oil in...
It's antifreeze...

12:25.645 --> 12:26.878
You put oil in it.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.179
I don't drive your van, man.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.314
This is any car.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.648
Any car is like this.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.117
No, man,
I fix robots, not vans.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.785
Robots have
engines, don't they?

12:33.787 --> 12:36.654
No, they don't have antifreeze.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.796
Are you sure
you put it in here?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.097
No, I mean, I put it
in front of this thing.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.866
Ah, Jesus.
Are you on drugs, Floyd?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.801
Well, that doesn't look good.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.138
Looks like you might
need some coolant
or something.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.307
Yeah, we've
definitely seen
better days.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.209
Be happy to take a look.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.412
Officer, do you know how far
it is to the Kyser place?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.715
Yeah, actually
there's a pretty
good Mexican place

13:03.717 --> 13:05.049
just up the road.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.619
Um, they have
really good enchiladas.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.089
And there's a pretty nice
little reasonable motel

13:11.091 --> 13:12.924
that's attached to it, so...

13:12.926 --> 13:16.194
Oh, no, again, we don't...
We don't need a motel.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.729
We stay the night,
it's what we do.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.330
It's part of our job, so...

13:19.332 --> 13:22.000
It's like video surveillance
throughout the nighttime.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.802
It's part of our deliverables.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.537
Oh, yeah, I guess they
did mention something

13:25.539 --> 13:27.405
about that, yeah.
I guess I thought...

13:27.407 --> 13:29.941
I thought they would
send... maybe send
someone with you,

13:29.943 --> 13:31.843
like a security guard.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.845
Oh, well, that's not necessary.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.180
We don't need that.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.282
I mean, this is our job.
It's what we do.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.184
Yeah, we can take
care of ourselves.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.186
But, I mean, do you have
any sort of suggestions

13:41.188 --> 13:44.022
or information
that you think we might
need to know that...

13:44.024 --> 13:46.090
I would suggest
staying at the motel.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.792
Oh...

13:47.794 --> 13:51.062
Yeah, I really don't
think they've told y'all

13:51.064 --> 13:52.397
enough about the place.

13:52.399 --> 13:56.801
So how long you been
into this paranormal stuff?

13:56.803 --> 14:00.505
Oh, you know,
just, like, since college.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.609
I bet you wanted to be a cop
ever since you were a kid.

14:04.611 --> 14:09.380
Ah, I don't know.
It's my job.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.002
Wow.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.912
Wow!

14:44.650 --> 14:46.384
I mean, it's amazing.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.685
It's all right.

14:47.687 --> 14:51.956
This is beautiful.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.226
This place is
totally fuckin' haunted.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.030
You think the water's
okay to drink?

14:59.032 --> 15:02.033
Yeah.
Yeah, it tastes fine.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.480
Maybe the guy from the bank
is here already.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.216
Yeah, I didn't see
any other cars,

15:18.218 --> 15:21.452
so I think
you guys might be
on your own, actually.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.421
Oh, that's fine.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.889
That's not a problem.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.527
I have a little bit of time.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.930
I could show you around
a little bit if you want.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.232
Yeah. Yeah, that
would actually be great.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.034
I'm sure you'd be better at it

15:36.036 --> 15:37.702
than the guys
from the bank anyway.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.003
Yeah, maybe.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.405
You know, it looks
like the bank's

15:40.407 --> 15:42.140
actually done a pretty good job
of cleaning it up,

15:42.142 --> 15:44.309
because they want to sell it.

15:44.311 --> 15:47.245
But they can't keep
maintenance people around.

15:47.247 --> 15:51.582
Hence, a pile of sticks
on the floor.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.351
That's a pentagram.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.121
Yeah, that figures.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.657
Kids are always
breaking in here
with their Ouija boards,

15:59.659 --> 16:01.092
doing their little ceremonies,

16:01.094 --> 16:03.328
trying to scare each other.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.463
Do you know
what kind of occult practices

16:05.465 --> 16:07.131
they're using?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.567
Uh, sticks
on the floor, I guess.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.806
Apparently, a place
is empty long enough,

16:14.808 --> 16:16.574
they forget
it's private property.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.311
Do you know any actual history

16:20.313 --> 16:21.746
about the place
that you could tell us?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.348
It actually has a pretty
interesting history.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.350
There are these people,
the Kysers,

16:25.352 --> 16:27.185
buy the place
back in the fifties

16:27.187 --> 16:29.320
after they come
into a bunch of oil money,

16:29.322 --> 16:30.955
which they apparently took as

16:30.957 --> 16:33.224
some kind of sign
from God or something.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.060
They have this big conversion,

16:36.062 --> 16:38.029
and they have some vision

16:38.031 --> 16:40.965
that this is holy ground
or something,

16:40.967 --> 16:43.768
so they buy the place,
put up a church.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.969
What kind of church?

16:44.971 --> 16:46.904
It was, uh...
It was Christian.

16:46.906 --> 16:51.909
Did have a little
bit of Eastern religion
mixed in there.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.344
It was actually pretty popular

16:53.346 --> 16:55.980
with people from
the town for a while.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.749
And then it became unpopular.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.384
Why is that?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.219
Well, you know, some
of the people from town

17:01.221 --> 17:02.887
got weirded out, I guess,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.990
by the whole
Eastern religion thing.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.791
People started saying
it was a cult.

17:07.794 --> 17:11.295
It was around that time
that the county decided

17:11.297 --> 17:13.897
they wanted to take
the land to build a mall.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.968
That fireplace is
off the charts.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.737
They had a little school here

17:19.739 --> 17:21.372
that went with their church.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.640
Wasn't bad.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.742
Parents actually had me
out here for a little while.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.412
You went to school here?

17:27.414 --> 17:30.148
Yeah, I was in class
with their daughter Mona.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.116
She wasn't a bad kid.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.852
But, uh, yeah, until
my parents pulled me out.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.487
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

17:36.489 --> 17:39.257
Well,
supposedly the Kysers were
pretty nasty drunks

17:39.259 --> 17:41.692
before their
whole religious conversion.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.863
So I guess with the cult rumors
and the, uh, land dispute,

17:45.865 --> 17:48.332
they, uh, got back
on the sauce,

17:48.334 --> 17:51.736
and their kids
started showing up places

17:51.738 --> 17:55.873
with weird marks
on their faces,
shit like that.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.942
So they liked to party, huh?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.978
You do the math.

18:05.417 --> 18:09.020
Anyway,
there's a really cool
staircase over here.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.627
Some really nice
metalwork right here.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.262
Pretty ornate.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.764
Yeah, I was... I was
thinking the same thing.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.132
It's pretty ornate.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.000
Solid oak banister,
too, I believe.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.969
So whatever happened
to the Kyser family?

18:24.971 --> 18:30.308
Uh, all that stuff
with the land dispute
and the cult stuff

18:30.310 --> 18:32.009
just kind of got
more and more ugly,

18:32.011 --> 18:34.445
and, uh, next thing you know,

18:34.447 --> 18:37.782
people are saying
that they're Satanists.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.853
They're trying to indoctrinate
kids into Satanism,

18:41.855 --> 18:44.155
involving them
in animal sacrifices.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.892
I never saw
any animal sacrifices, but...

18:47.894 --> 18:50.995
Now, obviously, no mall.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.030
Who is this guy?

18:56.902 --> 18:58.936
So people
started saying the state

18:58.938 --> 19:00.304
should take custody
of the kids,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.106
and, next thing you know,

19:02.108 --> 19:05.977
Mona and Frankie Kyser
disappear.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.745
And, naturally,
everyone starts saying

19:09.281 --> 19:11.983
that their parents sacrificed
their kids to the Devil

19:11.985 --> 19:13.818
and burned them up
in the incinerator.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.755
Police show up
a few days later
to investigate,

19:17.757 --> 19:20.124
nobody's here,

19:20.126 --> 19:22.793
and, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Kyser

19:22.795 --> 19:27.465
turn up in a motel room
a few miles away, dead.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.735
Mrs. Kyser had her head
bashed in with a TV,

19:30.737 --> 19:34.071
and Mr. Kyser had, uh,
blown his brains out.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.374
Blah!
Aah!

19:36.376 --> 19:38.142
God damn it, Floyd!

19:38.144 --> 19:42.213
Kids come in here and get
all high on whatever,

19:42.215 --> 19:45.183
say they see ghosts, demons.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.654
Kid fell out this window
and broke his neck.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.328
We gotta put
a camera in this room.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.398
They found a leg over here.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.134
Has anyone lived
here since the Kysers?

20:03.136 --> 20:04.669
Yeah, about 15 years ago,

20:04.671 --> 20:06.070
there was a couple
that lived here.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.705
What happened to them?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.373
They died.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.977
Multiple stab wounds
to each other.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.913
In the kitchen is
where we found them.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.349
Well, this place is fucked up.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.886
It's a pain in my ass,
tell you that much.

20:21.888 --> 20:27.124
There's people say
that the Kysers opened
up a gate to Hell.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.060
I don't know about that,

20:29.062 --> 20:32.196
but if you guys
find it, maybe you can
charge admission.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.778
Gate to Hell, gate to Hell.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.047
Gate to Hell, that's it!
This place is evil.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.515
The Kysers were Satanists,

20:51.517 --> 20:53.618
so they they built their school
on hallowed ground

20:53.620 --> 20:56.120
and indoctrinated
the children into blood rituals

20:56.122 --> 20:57.521
so they could open
a gate to Hell.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.990
They fear God.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.424
Oh, my God.
My God!

21:00.426 --> 21:01.659
They sacrificed
their own children

21:01.661 --> 21:03.361
to appease
the Prince of Darkness!

21:03.363 --> 21:04.662
They will possess
the weak-minded.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.796
I must warn Floyd!

21:05.798 --> 21:07.565
I must not fear. Must not fear.
I must not fear.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.468
Fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.779
Guys!

21:31.256 --> 21:33.457
Yeah, so what'd
you think so far?

21:33.459 --> 21:35.259
I think it's amazing.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.094
I'm really excited.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.664
Well, I know what
you're gonna say next.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.665
That, you know...

21:40.667 --> 21:41.866
Oh.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.235
You're professionals,
and this is what you do...

21:44.237 --> 21:46.404
You got it.
And you're fine,

21:46.406 --> 21:47.905
staying here all night,

21:47.907 --> 21:52.143
but I wouldn't mind stopping by
when my shift is over,

21:52.145 --> 21:53.778
if that's okay.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.112
Yeah.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.280
It would make me feel better.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.448
This place is for real, guys.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.549
Why don't we put
a camera on him?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.551
Can you not do that, please?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.053
Are they flirting?

22:02.055 --> 22:03.120
Nope.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.955
Are you jealous?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.258
No, I'm over that.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.259
Okay.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.493
I have my card here,

22:09.495 --> 22:11.162
if you need anything
in the meantime.

22:11.164 --> 22:15.533
It does have
my car phone number,

22:15.535 --> 22:17.101
as well as my office phone.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.235
Got it.

22:18.237 --> 22:22.540
So if you need anything at all,

22:22.542 --> 22:24.975
feel free to call
either of those numbers.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.977
All right, I will.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.245
I'm sure we'll be fine.

22:28.247 --> 22:31.782
Okay, well...

22:31.784 --> 22:33.417
I'll see you later.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.019
All right, I'll see you later.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.153
Okay, bye.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.621
Bye.

22:43.161 --> 22:45.563
Okay, before we go any further,

22:45.565 --> 22:47.698
can we just acknowledge

22:47.700 --> 22:50.634
that there's really
something in this house
that's real?

22:50.636 --> 22:52.737
There's something here,
and we're gonna
capture it.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.071
If we're gonna
capture something,

22:54.073 --> 22:55.573
it's gonna happen
tonight, okay?

22:55.575 --> 22:56.907
Yeah, listen,
absolutely, I agree.
Can you not do that?

22:56.909 --> 22:58.776
Hey, Floyd...
You're a fucking child!

22:58.778 --> 22:59.977
Would you go find where
to turn the electricity on,

22:59.979 --> 23:01.245
so we can get to work?

23:01.247 --> 23:02.246
Please?

23:02.248 --> 23:03.314
All right.
Thank you.

23:03.316 --> 23:04.448
Goin' to work.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.016
Come on, Hamlet.
See?

23:07.919 --> 23:09.653
Come on, Hambone.

23:14.493 --> 23:17.228
Our work's never done, man.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.296
Let's go.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.539
Huh.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.509
"Hey, Floyd,
go turn on the power.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.245
"Hey, Floyd, fix the van.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.314
Hey, guys, go fuck yourself."

23:40.118 --> 23:42.153
Huh.

23:42.155 --> 23:44.355
Well, I don't see shit.

23:44.357 --> 23:47.057
Hey, check it out, Hambone.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.563
It's the Kyser family
incinerator.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.702
Here, kiddy, kiddy.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.672
Well, there definitely was
not a party in here.

24:06.545 --> 24:10.714
Well, this is creepy.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.820
What the fuck?

24:22.828 --> 24:25.095
Huh.

24:30.736 --> 24:31.936
Chad?

24:37.108 --> 24:38.309
Hi.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.543
I'm gonna grab some things.

24:39.545 --> 24:40.878
I'm telling you, babe,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.980
I felt something
in that first room,

24:42.982 --> 24:43.814
the dining room,

24:43.816 --> 24:45.449
unlike any of the other places.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.318
Did you feel it right here?

24:47.320 --> 24:48.819
No, I didn't
feel it back there.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.020
I'm telling you.
I told you so...

24:50.022 --> 24:51.583
You sure? Maybe you
felt it right, oh...

25:08.273 --> 25:09.406
Huh.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.411
Goddamn flashlight.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.586
I can promise
you this, Hambone.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.593
We are not going in there.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.334
Can we please not stay
in the pentagram room?

25:37.336 --> 25:39.503
This looks exactly
like the pentagram

25:39.505 --> 25:41.005
in the '52 incident
in Manhattan Beach.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.139
You guys remember it?

25:42.141 --> 25:43.707
It wasn't facing north,
just like this one.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.209
This one's facing north.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.677
North-ish.

25:46.679 --> 25:49.580
It looks like a soccer
ball made out of twigs.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.115
No, this is the top,
right here.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.517
Floyd, did you put
lights on my microphone?

25:53.519 --> 25:55.252
Yes, I did.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.655
I thought they'd match
your sweater vest, Chadwick.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.624
Jeez. Thanks.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.306
Blah!
Aah!

26:49.308 --> 26:50.975
Shit.

26:50.977 --> 26:54.144
No, Floyd, I need it more...

26:54.146 --> 26:56.614
It's fine.
It's all the way open.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.415
I need it more
to the right.
It's fine.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.417
I really think it's important
to get the bathroom over here.

27:00.419 --> 27:03.020
It's all the way open, and
it's wide, Crimson, okay?

27:03.022 --> 27:04.388
Let it go.
Oh, you know what?

27:04.390 --> 27:05.589
This is what I do.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.957
Please, really
don't call me that.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.258
What do you
want me to call you?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.227
Come on, we got
more lights to set up.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.261
Aw!

27:26.878 --> 27:30.280
Hello?
Can you hear me?

27:31.983 --> 27:35.753
Hello?
Can you hear me?

27:38.758 --> 27:42.192
Can you hear me?

28:07.085 --> 28:08.986
Is that you, Mona?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.790
Mona Kyser?

28:13.958 --> 28:18.395
May I speak to Mona
or Frankie Kyser?

29:41.980 --> 29:46.917
Spirits of this house,
please give me a sign.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.121
Spirits of this house,

29:51.123 --> 29:55.225
if you can hear me,
knock two times.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.395
Chad?

30:06.171 --> 30:07.938
Mona?

30:22.087 --> 30:23.854
Mona?

30:23.856 --> 30:27.291
Are you singing to me, Mona?

30:32.965 --> 30:36.166
Would you like to sing for me?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.434
My name is Chad.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.507
Mona?

30:45.677 --> 30:46.910
What?

30:52.784 --> 30:56.220
Sing to me again.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.833
Aah!

31:09.835 --> 31:11.902
There's something
that we don't understand

31:11.904 --> 31:13.203
that is going on in this house.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.405
This place is dangerous, okay?

31:15.641 --> 31:18.242
- We need to get out of here.
- Worry too much.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.444
Gwen, look, I... I can't
stay here. I'm gonna go.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.712
You can stay here.
I want you to stay here.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.213
Are you serious?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.848
I'm gonna take the van.
What are you afraid of?

31:24.850 --> 31:26.416
I'll be back
in the morning, I'm sorry.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.651
- I just cannot do it.
- Hey, my shit's in that van.

31:27.653 --> 31:28.852
I'm gonna leave.

31:28.854 --> 31:30.020
Don't be a pussy.
I'm sorry.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.022
Hey.
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.191
Yeah, what?
Okay.
All right, okay.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.897
Maybe there is something.

31:39.899 --> 31:42.432
I'm not... I'm not saying
that there is,

31:42.434 --> 31:44.101
but what if there is?

31:44.103 --> 31:47.304
What if there is,
and what if we find it

31:47.306 --> 31:50.407
and record it
and can verify it?

31:50.409 --> 31:51.541
Floyd!

31:51.543 --> 31:53.277
What if we can do that?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.479
And that would
be worth so much more.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.847
It's not about money.

31:56.849 --> 31:58.048
This is not
about money right now.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.483
Okay, it's not about money.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.852
What is the one thing
you told me you've wanted

32:01.854 --> 32:04.421
ever since you were a kid, huh?

32:04.423 --> 32:05.622
The one thing?

32:05.624 --> 32:07.958
Uh, antifreeze.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.227
He wants antifreeze
for his vagina.

32:10.229 --> 32:13.997
That you wanted to see a ghost.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.768
And now, it's a possibility.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.469
Are you seriously telling me

32:19.471 --> 32:22.406
that you're willing
to just give it up right now

32:22.408 --> 32:23.540
when you're so close?

32:24.342 --> 32:26.610
I mean...

32:26.612 --> 32:28.312
Please stay.

32:37.922 --> 32:39.356
Okay.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.924
Okay.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.462
Remember when it used
to be just me and you?

32:45.464 --> 32:46.596
I mean, it was us.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.966
Is this about me and Chad?

32:48.968 --> 32:50.567
Come on, Gwen.

32:50.569 --> 32:51.635
Or is it about Floyd?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.370
Because I warned you about him.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.405
Okay, well, I warned
you about Chad.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.642
Yeah, but Chad and I
are still together.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.278
Yeah, I am painfully
aware of that.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.014
Guess we've gone
a little Scooby-Doo.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.649
We used to be more
like The Galloping Ghost.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.317
Mm-hmm.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.654
Two girls conquering
the world's unsolved mysteries.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.191
I thought you
never watched television.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.260
I don't.

34:07.745 --> 34:11.681
Why don't you give me a treat?

34:11.683 --> 34:13.183
I fed Hamlet.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.966
He was hungry.

34:33.271 --> 34:36.206
Mmm, this tastes good.

34:37.708 --> 34:41.545
Why don't you give me a treat?

34:43.947 --> 34:45.715
Are you okay?

34:49.054 --> 34:53.123
I'm a good boy.

34:53.125 --> 34:58.662
Nancy's my favorite,
but Floyd feeds me,

34:58.664 --> 35:01.465
'cause I'm a good boy.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.699
I'm a good boy!

35:04.001 --> 35:05.769
Scratch me.

35:05.771 --> 35:09.039
Just behind my ear,
it's my spot.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.508
Want to go chase a car?

35:11.510 --> 35:12.709
I like chasing cars.

35:13.978 --> 35:16.046
Fuck you!

35:21.019 --> 35:24.221
Don't fuckin' touch me.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.623
I'm cool, man.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.225
I'm cool, I'm cool.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.893
Don't you fuckin' touch me.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.795
I'm cool, man.
Don't.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.599
I'm cool, I'm cool,
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool.

35:35.601 --> 35:39.769
I'm cool.

35:39.771 --> 35:42.973
I'm cool, man.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.808
Okay.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.444
Whoo, all right, I am feeling

35:47.446 --> 35:49.779
a little buzzy from that cig.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.448
Yeah, we never
should have quit.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.516
No kidding.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.684
Help me up.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.852
Fuck!

35:55.854 --> 35:58.989
Oh, my God, did...

35:58.991 --> 36:00.257
Oh, my God.
Well, we have light.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.725
We have light.
Give me that.

36:01.727 --> 36:02.726
Is Chad upstairs?

36:02.728 --> 36:05.128
I...don't think so.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.297
We did not turn on the lights.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.166
This guy is fuckin' possessed!

36:09.168 --> 36:10.200
Oh, come on.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.234
The lights came on somehow

36:11.236 --> 36:12.369
that had nothing to do with us!

36:12.371 --> 36:14.304
I'm not possessed
It was a joke.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.106
I'm telling you, this place
is fucking haunted, man!

36:16.108 --> 36:17.307
We came to
a fuckin' haunted house!

36:17.309 --> 36:18.975
This is a real
fucking haunted house!

36:18.977 --> 36:20.577
Chad, chill out it's okay.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.312
I'm telling you, man,
this is a fucking crazy place.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.014
Floyd, did you
turn the electricity on?

36:24.016 --> 36:25.182
No...
Yeah, okay, look.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.249
It's just a joke.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.350
We're just gonna calm down,

36:27.352 --> 36:28.818
and we're gonna go upstairs.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.387
Someone turned the lights on,
it wasn't us.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.621
We're gonna figure out
who it was.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.455
Oh, God!

36:32.457 --> 36:33.857
Maybe it was a ghost.
God!

36:33.859 --> 36:35.425
Wouldn't that be interesting,
if it was a ghost?

36:35.427 --> 36:36.560
Come on.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.827
I need you
to tell me right now,

36:37.829 --> 36:38.895
are you fucking with him again?

36:38.897 --> 36:39.963
I need you to tell me.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.031
No.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.365
Don't be scared, Chad.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.768
Hey, Floyd,
suck my fuckin' cock.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.603
He's just a scaredy-cat.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.439
Floyd, are you
fucking with him?

36:50.575 --> 36:52.242
Yeah.

36:52.244 --> 36:53.443
You're fucking with him?

36:53.445 --> 36:55.579
Yeah, totally.
Don't fuck with him.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.147
It's funny, though.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.186
But I didn't
turn on the lights.

37:23.275 --> 37:25.775
Did you hear that?

37:25.777 --> 37:27.978
Nope.

37:27.980 --> 37:29.546
I heard something.

37:35.286 --> 37:38.154
That's the window
the kids fell out of.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.891
Man.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.660
Séances are weird.

37:43.662 --> 37:48.598
You know, they get all
these leaves from someplace.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.601
It's like, they just want
to connect with something.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.136
That's the same paraphernalia

37:53.138 --> 37:55.739
from that '74 incident
in Munich.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.073
These kids aren't
fucking around.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.341
They bring in this stuff,

37:58.343 --> 37:59.809
and they sit there,
and they actually chant.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.244
They actually call up
something evil.

38:01.246 --> 38:05.215
No, they just want
to connect with stuff.

38:05.217 --> 38:07.684
I love that you know
about these things,

38:07.686 --> 38:09.386
and I also...

38:09.388 --> 38:11.354
I love that you can
feel things, Chad, you know?

38:11.356 --> 38:13.390
Because I don't feel
that stuff.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.191
I wish I did that.
I don't do that.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.961
I'm always thinking, you know?

38:20.231 --> 38:22.565
I just want to feel things.

38:23.734 --> 38:24.934
And you don't think.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.237
You're not always thinking
all the time, like me.

38:27.239 --> 38:28.471
You know,
I'm always in my mind.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.874
I don't feel.
I don't just like...

38:30.876 --> 38:32.375
feel things.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.576
You feel things.

38:33.578 --> 38:34.611
No, I don't.

38:34.613 --> 38:38.214
No, cold spots.
Hot spots, right?

38:38.216 --> 38:40.450
See, you walk into
a room in this house,

38:40.452 --> 38:42.619
and it's like somebody
turned up the thermostat.

38:44.189 --> 38:47.691
You know, I start...
I start sweating, and, uh,

38:47.693 --> 38:51.795
as I have these, like,
heart palpitations
or something.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.697
And it's just like,
there's just something...

38:53.699 --> 38:56.900
There's... There's
something really
significant going on.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.569
You know, I just want to feel
like I'm inside of this place.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.605
I just want to be close.
I just want to love.

39:02.607 --> 39:05.542
Oh, I just want to be
so close to it.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.477
I want to be like an insect,

39:07.479 --> 39:09.212
and all of my six legs
are gonna gonna touch

39:09.214 --> 39:11.014
the whole inside of this house.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.551
Uh...

39:14.553 --> 39:16.453
What...

40:19.316 --> 40:22.452
It's just kids. Ahem.

40:30.361 --> 40:34.397
There ain't shit going on.

40:43.707 --> 40:44.974
All right.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.344
Put some music on.

41:00.558 --> 41:03.393
All the virgins
in all the stories,

41:03.395 --> 41:06.129
all the virgins,
they were sacrificed.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.934
Pull it tighter.

41:12.002 --> 41:15.705
Look at me.

41:22.947 --> 41:23.980
Whoo.

41:47.638 --> 41:51.040
♪ I've got this feeling

41:51.042 --> 41:53.776
♪ You've got the tools

43:12.389 --> 43:14.490
That's a party.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.007
Come on!
Creepy shit!

43:31.009 --> 43:32.408
Creepy shit!

43:37.948 --> 43:41.584
Chad, you look
like you're on fire.

43:52.863 --> 43:54.197
Chad, you all right?

43:55.700 --> 43:57.567
There was a creep.

43:57.569 --> 43:59.936
Nance, what the fuck?

44:03.407 --> 44:04.607
Ah, fuck!

44:04.609 --> 44:06.209
What the fuck?

44:14.451 --> 44:17.086
Stupid fucking cunt!

44:20.991 --> 44:22.458
Hey, man, tell me there was
a fuckin' ghost or demon

44:22.460 --> 44:23.693
who set my fuckin' van on fire!

44:23.695 --> 44:24.894
No, I was going
up there to tell you guys

44:24.896 --> 44:25.962
there was something
in the fucking room!

44:25.964 --> 44:27.430
Why the fuck did you do that?

44:27.432 --> 44:29.265
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

44:29.267 --> 44:30.833
You're completely right.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.935
It is all my fault, and I
am a stupid fucking cunt.

44:32.937 --> 44:34.137
No, you can't
talk to Nancy like that.

44:34.139 --> 44:36.973
You used my fucking
equipment and my van

44:36.975 --> 44:38.841
to try and disprove
something I believe in,

44:38.843 --> 44:40.743
so I'm the big
fucking joke tonight!

44:40.745 --> 44:43.246
I'm gonna make it right!
I'm gonna fix it!

44:43.248 --> 44:44.480
Good, you should!

44:44.482 --> 44:45.648
Okay!
You guys
need to calm down!

44:45.650 --> 44:47.216
Look, it's not your fault.

44:47.218 --> 44:48.885
Yes, it is my fault,
and I'm really sorry.

44:48.887 --> 44:50.153
You fucking try
to disprove it every day!

44:50.155 --> 44:51.788
You are making
a fucking joke of me!

44:51.790 --> 44:53.456
I'm a big fucking joke!

44:53.458 --> 44:55.124
Everyone thinks it's hilarious.

44:55.126 --> 44:57.427
Would you listen to me?!
I'm gonna make it better!

44:57.429 --> 44:58.761
No!
Hey, guys?

44:58.763 --> 45:00.396
Hey, guys! Hey!

45:00.398 --> 45:01.831
Hey!
You're not a joke!

45:01.833 --> 45:02.899
Hey!

45:02.901 --> 45:04.233
So when I was working
on the van

45:04.235 --> 45:06.169
and you guys were
chatting with the cop,

45:06.171 --> 45:07.904
I got rid of my stash.

45:07.906 --> 45:10.573
I threw my pipe in the cooler,

45:10.575 --> 45:13.409
and I put my bag of acid
in this Thermos.

45:13.411 --> 45:14.711
Fuck, Floyd.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.746
I filled that with water.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.849
We're on acid, Floyd?!

45:19.851 --> 45:21.084
It's cool.
It's okay!

45:21.086 --> 45:22.885
It's okay!
It's low-grade stuff!

45:22.887 --> 45:24.253
It means we're tripping balls!

45:24.255 --> 45:25.655
Okay, okay, okay.
We're just seeing shit!

45:25.657 --> 45:27.223
Look, look.
That's all it means!

45:27.225 --> 45:28.791
This is good news!

45:28.793 --> 45:31.160
So what you're telling
me is that the van

45:31.162 --> 45:34.130
could potentially
not be on fire
out there right now?

45:34.132 --> 45:35.732
No, I'm not saying that.
The van's on fire.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.900
I'm saying you guys
are tripping balls,

45:37.902 --> 45:39.302
and it's cool... No, no!

45:39.304 --> 45:40.336
Fucking asshole!

45:40.338 --> 45:41.437
Hey! Hey!
No!

45:41.439 --> 45:42.605
You have fucked me!

45:42.607 --> 45:43.906
You have fucking lost it, man!

45:43.908 --> 45:45.374
Don't fucking touch me!

45:45.376 --> 45:46.642
You need to calm down!

45:46.644 --> 45:47.944
You're a whore, okay?

45:47.946 --> 45:49.512
You guys just need
to calm down.
What?

45:49.514 --> 45:50.580
It's low-grade shit.
You're a whore.

45:50.582 --> 45:51.981
I'm gonna fucking kill you

45:51.983 --> 45:52.982
before the night's over, man!

45:52.984 --> 45:54.283
No, you guys are tripping!

45:54.285 --> 45:56.119
Motherfucker,
I will fucking kill you

45:56.121 --> 45:57.754
if you come near me again!

45:57.756 --> 45:59.622
All right.
Fucking asshole.

45:59.624 --> 46:01.124
I'm out.

46:02.559 --> 46:03.826
What did you call me, Chad?

46:03.828 --> 46:06.295
I called you a whore.

46:06.297 --> 46:11.701
I'm gonna assume this is
coming out of... you're upset?

46:13.203 --> 46:15.371
No, it's coming out
of you being a whore.

46:16.807 --> 46:20.610
Don't you ever
call me that again.

46:20.612 --> 46:23.045
I'm gonna go get
our clothes now,

46:23.047 --> 46:27.150
and when I get back,
I expect an apology.

46:31.088 --> 46:33.256
God damn you!

46:34.392 --> 46:36.225
Fuck!

46:37.427 --> 46:38.861
Fuck!

46:54.378 --> 46:56.179
Nancy.
Floyd.

46:56.181 --> 46:57.413
Look, fuck Chad.

46:57.415 --> 46:59.348
He's a dumb-ass.
He doesn't know shit.

46:59.350 --> 47:00.783
Just go back inside, okay?

47:00.785 --> 47:02.018
I don't even know why
you're coming out here.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.886
Look, I'm sorry about the van.

47:03.888 --> 47:05.588
I'm sorry about the van.

47:05.590 --> 47:07.089
I'm sorry about the acid.

47:08.193 --> 47:10.560
You're just fli...
You're flipping out.

47:10.562 --> 47:12.161
You're just tripping.
It's cool, calm down.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.930
Okay, I just don't know
why you're out here.

47:13.932 --> 47:15.998
I just want you
to go back inside, okay?

47:16.000 --> 47:19.268
I just want to be
out here by myself.

47:19.270 --> 47:20.436
What are you doing?

47:20.438 --> 47:21.804
I'm standing here.

47:21.806 --> 47:24.240
I'm gonna sleep
in the fucking fountain.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.946
You're not gonna sleep
in the fountain.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.914
Yeah, I am. I'm gonna
sleep in the fountain.

47:31.916 --> 47:33.749
All right, then
I'm gonna stay with you.

47:33.751 --> 47:35.151
No, don't stay with me.

47:35.153 --> 47:37.687
I don't need you to stay
with me, all right?

47:37.689 --> 47:39.522
I don't even know
why you would want to.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.490
I'm fucking everything up.

47:41.492 --> 47:42.892
Everyone is here because of me.

47:42.894 --> 47:45.228
Everything is my fault.

47:47.164 --> 47:51.701
Look, I'm here because of you.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.102
Yeah.

47:53.104 --> 47:54.470
Don't.

47:54.472 --> 47:57.840
I know that sucks,
but I'm here 'cause of you.

47:58.976 --> 48:01.377
It's okay.
Will you calm down?

48:01.379 --> 48:03.646
It's gonna be fine.

48:03.648 --> 48:06.015
Just concentrate on my voice.

48:06.017 --> 48:07.817
Just calm down.

48:07.819 --> 48:10.686
See? Just have fun.

48:10.688 --> 48:12.388
Just have fun.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.357
It's okay.

48:19.897 --> 48:20.997
You sure?

48:20.999 --> 48:23.532
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

48:43.787 --> 48:47.657
Well, I predicted it, didn't I?

48:47.659 --> 48:49.358
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't know.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.060
Like, it just seemed like...
You didn't know?

48:51.062 --> 48:52.561
I told you this place
was dangerous.
I know.

48:52.563 --> 48:54.230
And now we're here,
and we're stuck here.

48:54.232 --> 48:56.132
But you get
that feeling a lot, Chad.

48:56.134 --> 48:57.833
Like, I can't believe
that every single time
you get a feeling.

48:57.835 --> 48:59.402
I made it a big deal.
I made it clear.

48:59.404 --> 49:00.436
Yeah.

49:00.438 --> 49:01.604
So we're stuck.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.205
I know.

49:05.108 --> 49:06.676
Look, what are we doing here?

49:06.678 --> 49:09.011
I don't know, I mean,

49:09.013 --> 49:10.746
I think we're gonna try to...

49:10.748 --> 49:11.847
Gwen.

49:11.849 --> 49:13.215
We're gonna...

49:13.217 --> 49:15.851
What we're gonna do
is we're gonna... walk.

49:15.853 --> 49:18.020
I mean, that's what we...
We have each other.

49:18.022 --> 49:19.221
It's gonna be fine.

49:19.223 --> 49:21.290
We're gonna get the van fixed.

49:21.292 --> 49:24.193
This is bullshit, okay?

49:24.195 --> 49:27.630
I know.
This is bullshit.

49:27.632 --> 49:28.664
What?

49:28.666 --> 49:30.633
What is this?

49:30.635 --> 49:32.935
What is... What is what?

49:32.937 --> 49:36.238
What we have.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.573
Chad, you're my boyfriend.

49:39.042 --> 49:40.276
You're my lover.

49:40.278 --> 49:41.877
I'm the money.
You're my...

49:45.082 --> 49:46.916
Yeah, I can't do this.

49:46.918 --> 49:48.484
I don't know,
you're doing pretty good.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.152
No, not this. This.

49:50.154 --> 49:52.488
I can't do this anymore.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.556
The group.

49:55.058 --> 49:57.660
I can't do it anymore.
I quit.

49:59.496 --> 50:00.763
You quit?

50:00.765 --> 50:01.964
Yeah, I quit.

50:01.966 --> 50:03.466
What the fuck are you gonna do?

50:03.468 --> 50:05.534
I don't know, I'm gonna
do something else.

50:07.037 --> 50:08.704
You can't do something else.

50:08.706 --> 50:11.741
Well, I know that, because
I'm not good at anything.

50:11.743 --> 50:14.310
No, there's
no such thing as ghosts,

50:14.312 --> 50:16.445
and you're really good
at not finding them.

50:16.447 --> 50:19.515
Well, I want to be really good
at finding something.

50:20.650 --> 50:22.051
Okay.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.553
You gotta take me with you.

50:24.555 --> 50:26.022
Floyd.
Look, I know,
I know, I know.

50:26.024 --> 50:27.356
I know, I know.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.291
Look, I don't care
about any of this.

50:29.293 --> 50:30.359
I don't care about any of this.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.261
I only care about you.
Aw.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.163
And Hamlet.
I don't care about
any of this stuff.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.632
I... I just...
Just take me with you.

50:38.068 --> 50:39.669
I don't know, Floyd.
Come on, no, no, no.

50:39.670 --> 50:40.970
Come on.
I don't know.

50:40.972 --> 50:42.471
I don't know if we
can do this again.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.206
No, I won't... I...

50:47.544 --> 50:48.878
Is that a car?

50:48.880 --> 50:51.947
Floyd, that's a car.

50:51.949 --> 50:54.817
Tell me you have
a Slim Jim in that bag.

50:54.819 --> 50:58.554
I totally have
a Slim Jim in this bag.

50:58.556 --> 51:02.091
I cannot tell
what's real anymore.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.960
I have just entered this home,

51:04.962 --> 51:09.265
where I actually
felt something that I
really wanted to feel,

51:09.267 --> 51:11.600
and I don't know
if it was real or not.

51:11.602 --> 51:16.439
Look, I know I've just
taken a tab of acid,

51:16.441 --> 51:18.574
and I've never done it before,

51:18.576 --> 51:21.944
but I don't know.

51:21.946 --> 51:24.113
Now we've gotten...

51:24.115 --> 51:26.315
Look where we've
gotten with this.

51:26.317 --> 51:28.150
Chad...

51:28.152 --> 51:30.686
are you breaking up with me?

51:32.456 --> 51:35.157
I can't lose you, Chad, okay?

51:35.159 --> 51:40.763
You're like... You make me
feel like a full person.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.531
I don't always feel that way.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.133
And I really...

51:44.135 --> 51:47.636
I didn't mean to cheat on you.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.407
I'm sorry.

51:59.316 --> 52:02.518
Look, this probably isn't
the right forum for this.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.886
Chad, I love you.

52:03.888 --> 52:05.521
I love you.

52:07.424 --> 52:09.892
I'm just gonna lie
down with this dog,

52:09.894 --> 52:11.560
because he loves me
unconditionally,

52:11.562 --> 52:14.330
and he's beautiful,
and he doesn't cheat
on me, either.

52:14.332 --> 52:17.500
Mm, I love you, Hamlet.

52:27.777 --> 52:33.048
Can you confirm
that this dog is
eating a human hand?

52:36.154 --> 52:37.686
You got it?

52:37.688 --> 52:38.921
Floyd!
What?!

52:38.923 --> 52:40.356
Over here!

52:41.725 --> 52:43.292
Where'd this come from?
We found a hand.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.161
We found a human hand.
You found a what?

52:45.163 --> 52:46.762
You're tripping balls, man.
We got a car, though.

52:46.764 --> 52:48.030
Hamlet got it.
Hamlet?

52:48.032 --> 52:49.098
- We got a car.
- It was in his mouth.

52:49.100 --> 52:50.366
I got this, though.
I got this.

52:50.368 --> 52:52.968
Where did this come from?
Hey, Hambone.

52:52.970 --> 52:54.403
Whose car is this?

52:54.405 --> 52:56.605
Can you get in?

52:56.607 --> 52:58.340
Floyd!

52:58.342 --> 53:00.376
Oh. We gotta get
the fuck out of here, man!

53:00.378 --> 53:01.911
We have got to get
the fuck out of here!

53:01.913 --> 53:03.179
Floyd, you gotta get that open!

53:03.181 --> 53:04.246
Hang on, hang on!

53:04.248 --> 53:05.281
I got it!

53:05.283 --> 53:06.715
I got it, I got it, I got it!

53:06.717 --> 53:07.950
Oh, yeah, man!

53:07.952 --> 53:09.218
Open the back, please!

53:09.220 --> 53:11.086
You got a Slim Jim in that bag,

53:11.088 --> 53:12.354
and you don't have a knife.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.622
We don't have a knife.

53:13.624 --> 53:16.525
Did anybody find
the fucking keys?

53:16.527 --> 53:18.194
Don't focus on the keys,

53:18.196 --> 53:19.695
focus on hotwiring the car.

53:19.697 --> 53:21.764
Yeah, I can hotwire
the car, Chad.

53:21.766 --> 53:24.133
Mike Ryan. Mike Ryan.

53:25.936 --> 53:27.336
The guy from the bank.

53:27.338 --> 53:29.004
What, do you need,
a fucking screwdriver?

53:29.006 --> 53:30.940
- Where the fuck are the keys?
- The guy from the bank.

53:30.942 --> 53:33.042
Where the fuck is he?

53:33.044 --> 53:34.376
Yeah, where is he?

53:34.378 --> 53:36.078
'Cause we'd really
like to use his car.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.813
Floyd, pop the trunk, please.

53:38.915 --> 53:41.116
Fuck! Oh, damn it.

53:41.118 --> 53:43.886
Okay, Floyd,
pop the trunk, please.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.324
Pop the trunk, Floyd!

53:48.326 --> 53:49.326
I don't know where it is!

53:49.327 --> 53:50.392
Floyd, pop the trunk!

53:50.394 --> 53:52.661
Stop fucking yelling.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.164
You found pliers?

53:55.166 --> 53:56.498
Yeah.

53:58.735 --> 54:01.136
Hey, guys...
Hey, guys.

54:04.808 --> 54:07.376
Hey, guys, I think
the banker's
in the trunk.

54:08.578 --> 54:10.479
What?

54:10.481 --> 54:13.015
I think
the banker's in the trunk.

54:13.017 --> 54:14.450
Fuck you.

54:32.202 --> 54:33.802
Oh, fuck, man.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.172
What the fuck?

54:37.174 --> 54:40.442
Okay, um, I'm gonna
go call that cop.

54:40.444 --> 54:43.846
You... You gotta
check him for keys.

54:47.183 --> 54:48.917
Sorry, man.

54:54.659 --> 54:56.458
Customer service,
this is David.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.694
Our records show
a past due balance
on your phone.

54:58.696 --> 54:59.662
No.

54:59.664 --> 55:00.929
But if you have
a major credit card,

55:00.931 --> 55:02.131
I'd be happy to take that.

55:02.133 --> 55:04.099
Okay, I'm trying to reach 911.

55:04.101 --> 55:06.602
Um, I'm sorry, 911
doesn't appear to be
the number you called.

55:06.604 --> 55:08.270
No. Okay,
I'm aware of that.

55:08.272 --> 55:09.638
I'm just trying
to reach the police.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.472
Mm-hmm.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.374
Then... then
can you just...

55:12.376 --> 55:14.276
Then can you just
patch me through to 911?

55:14.278 --> 55:16.779
I would really need
some form of payment.

55:18.415 --> 55:19.581
Get his back pocket.

55:21.285 --> 55:24.119
My records show that you
are over $300 past due.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.421
I'm very sorry.

55:25.423 --> 55:28.190
Can you please just
put me through to 911?

55:28.192 --> 55:29.491
I can take your information

55:29.493 --> 55:30.959
and try to get you
at the front
of the line.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.362
I cannot do that right now!
It is an emergency!

55:33.364 --> 55:35.831
Just please,
can you get me 911?!

55:47.778 --> 55:50.412
Th... There's...

55:50.414 --> 55:52.214
There's someone at the house!

55:52.216 --> 55:54.783
Guys, there's someone
at the house!

55:54.785 --> 55:57.219
Motherfucker! Hey!

55:57.221 --> 55:58.287
Hamlet!
Hamlet!

55:58.289 --> 55:59.588
They went upstairs!

55:59.590 --> 56:01.757
He's upstairs!
Guys, he's upstairs!

56:14.304 --> 56:15.704
Hamlet!

56:15.706 --> 56:16.739
Hamlet!

56:16.741 --> 56:17.806
Hamlet?

56:18.876 --> 56:19.908
Hamlet!

56:22.113 --> 56:23.812
Hamlet!

56:43.767 --> 56:46.268
Fuck!
Do you see him?

56:46.270 --> 56:47.269
No!

56:47.271 --> 56:48.303
Hamlet!

56:54.511 --> 56:55.744
Hamlet?

57:12.362 --> 57:14.897
No, come on, Hamlet!

57:17.668 --> 57:18.801
Gwen!

57:23.406 --> 57:24.640
Nancy?

57:24.642 --> 57:26.675
- Gwen?
- Hamlet!

57:26.677 --> 57:27.509
Nancy!

57:27.511 --> 57:30.813
Floyd? Hamlet?

57:30.815 --> 57:32.247
Hamlet?

57:32.249 --> 57:33.282
Chad?

57:35.186 --> 57:36.718
Nancy?

57:39.789 --> 57:40.989
Gwen?

57:42.025 --> 57:43.358
Floyd?

57:43.360 --> 57:45.327
Hamlet!

57:45.329 --> 57:47.396
Hamlet!

57:47.398 --> 57:48.764
Hamlet.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.034
Floyd?

57:54.238 --> 57:55.437
Chad!

57:57.740 --> 57:58.974
Chad?

57:58.976 --> 58:00.809
Gwen?

58:03.112 --> 58:04.313
Gwen?

58:04.315 --> 58:06.048
Oh!
Shh!

58:06.050 --> 58:07.516
Fucking hell.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.766
Hamlet!

58:27.237 --> 58:28.237
Chad?

58:28.239 --> 58:29.471
Hamlet!

58:30.773 --> 58:31.807
Hamlet!

58:31.809 --> 58:33.041
Hamlet!

58:33.043 --> 58:37.546
I swear to fucking God,
he came in this room.

58:53.129 --> 58:54.963
That didn't sound good.

59:13.583 --> 59:16.485
Tell me you shut this door.

59:16.487 --> 59:18.353
No.

59:18.355 --> 59:20.455
Fuck, man.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.094
No, no, no.

59:30.533 --> 59:32.200
What the fuck, man?

59:32.202 --> 59:33.936
What the fuck?

59:40.143 --> 59:41.877
It's fucking blood.

59:50.386 --> 59:53.555
Mother... Get him!

59:53.557 --> 59:54.690
Chad!

59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.696
What the fuck, man.

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.904
Unh! You killed
my fucking dog?!

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:11.006
What the fuck is wrong
with you?!

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.975
Fuck you! Fuck!

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:14.376
You shit! Fuck!

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:17.212
You want to die?
Die!

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.348
Chad, stop!

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.116
Chad, stop!

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.319
Chad!

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.957
Waah!

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.302
Come on!

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:42.938
No, Chad!

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.606
Get in there!

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:49.277
Get the dresser,
get the dresser!

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:52.347
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.985
Get down. Shh, shh!

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.854
Turn your lights off,
turn your lights off!

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.003
Shh.

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:19.508
What the fuck, man.

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.748
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:07.723
What the fuck...

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.796
Fuckin' prick.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.908
It's okay.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.443
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:31.446
Fuck, man.

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:03.111
Someone's outside.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:07.282
Yeah, what is it?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.416
It's that cop.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:16.151
Help me open it.

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:22.424
Shh, shh!

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:23.758
We gotta get out.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.694
We gotta get out of here.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:27.095
We gotta get out.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.833
We gotta get out.

01:04:31.835 --> 01:04:35.170
We're gonna get out,
We're gonna get out.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:43.645
Shh, shh, shh!

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:45.146
No!

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:46.848
What the fuck are you doing?

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.496
Okay.

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.766
Okay, okay.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.935
We're gonna get out of here.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.476
We're gonna get out.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:17.112
We're gonna get out.
We're gonna get out.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.080
We're gonna get out.
We're gonna get out.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:22.417
Gwen, give me that ax.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.120
We're gonna get out.

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:26.821
Gwen, give me the fuckin' ax.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:27.956
We're gonna get out.
Hey, Gwen.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:30.725
Come on, give me the ax.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.827
Okay.

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:35.363
Gwen, give me the fucking ax.

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:37.832
Gwen, give him the ax.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.570
Gwen, give me the fucking ax.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:44.739
No.

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.641
Gwen. Gwen!

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:48.476
Gwen!

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:50.545
No.
Okay... okay...

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.148
Shut the fuck up.
You're gonna get us killed.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:17.439
Floyd, it's the cop.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.642
No!

01:06:22.379 --> 01:06:23.445
Fuck, man!

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.614
Man! Fuck!

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:43.064
Run!

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:47.402
Aah!
Aah!

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:54.009
Let me the fuck out!

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:09.457
Nancy!

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.576
Fuck you, man!

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.683
Nancy!

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:39.554
Floyd! Floyd!

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.358
No! No!

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.261
He's taking me!

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.563
[sobbing) I can't get it.

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:55.970
Fuck!

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.908
Okay, okay, okay...

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.043
No!
Shh! Gwen! Gwen!

01:08:05.015 --> 01:08:06.281
I... I need you to help me.

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:07.849
I need you to reach around

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.417
and get the fucking thing.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:12.387
Okay? Come on.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.131
God!

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.203
Shh. Quiet.

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:30.671
Let's open it up.

01:08:30.674 --> 01:08:31.840
There's a thing up there.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.274
There's a thing up there.

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.877
Come on, let's go.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:37.645
Come with me.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.198
Where are your friends?

01:08:58.201 --> 01:08:59.200
Where are your friends?

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.368
They're dead.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.203
They chopped his head off.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:05.907
Who's that?
Who's in the house?

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.008
Ghosts.

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.577
He doesn't have a face.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.354
He doesn't have a face.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:21.788
Shh. Shut up.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.629
Freeze, muthafucka!

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.836
I got him.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.571
Let's go out the side door.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:48.582
Do you have something?

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:51.719
Get back.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.755
No, wait.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.021
Did you call for backup?

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:28.523
Yeah, it's gonna be awhile.

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:39.834
Okay.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:41.102
Come on! Hurry up!

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:45.740
Aah! Aah!

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.517
Let's go.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.355
Fuck. All right.

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:24.545
Let's go.

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:25.780
Let's go.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:27.682
No, we can't.
We can't.
Let's go.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:28.683
No, Gwen!

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:31.519
Okay, no, we gotta go back.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:32.387
We gotta go.

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.521
We have to check on him.

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:35.056
We have to go see if he's okay.

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:37.325
Nancy, he's not okay.

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:39.994
No, you don't know that.
Okay? Nobody's okay.

01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:40.995
Gwen, you don't know that.

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:42.196
He's not okay.

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.032
I can't just
let this happen again.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:46.234
I can't let him just die.

01:11:46.236 --> 01:11:47.602
I can't do this again.

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.704
You're gonna die.
Don't go back.

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:50.872
Listen.

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:53.174
Okay, I know you're
not gonna go, all right?

01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:54.542
It's okay.
You don't have to go.

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.844
You stay here, and you go
find help, all right?

01:11:56.846 --> 01:11:58.179
It's okay.
Go find help.

01:11:58.181 --> 01:11:59.580
He said there's gonna
be backup soon.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:01.115
It's okay.

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:02.717
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?
Don't leave me.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.620
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm so sorry.

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:06.454
I'm so sorry.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.323
I have to go.
I have to go!

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:09.891
Nancy, no!

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:10.925
It's okay.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:14.782
What the fuck?!

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.990
Fuck you!

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.531
Fuck!

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:06.033
Jesus Christ, Gwen!

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:08.102
I almost fucking shot you!

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:09.337
Okay...

01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:11.105
I had to find you.

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:14.575
It's gotta be the two of us.

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:17.845
Nancy, I think
I solved the mystery.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.013
It's the Kysers.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.749
No, that's crazy.
They're dead.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.351
No, they're not.
They're dead.

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:24.719
Mona and Frankie.

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.788
It has to be
the Kyser children.

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.558
Remember how Officer Lance
said that people from the county

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.527
were always trying to
take away the Kysers' house?

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.428
Right, so they
could build a mall?

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:35.963
But what
if that was the real reason

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:38.299
people accused the Kysers
of being Satanists?

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:41.402
And maybe because the family
couldn't take it anymore...

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.071
Gwen, that's why
they killed themselves
and their kids.

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:48.276
No, what if they
didn't kill the kids?

01:15:48.278 --> 01:15:50.077
What if they actually ran away?

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:53.915
Right.
And they must have been
hiding here all along!

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:57.084
And, somehow, they
raised themselves, and...

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:59.220
Gwen, they're just
a couple of little kids

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:00.855
trying to protect their home.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:03.157
It's the only explanation
that makes any sense.

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:11.132
Listen to me.
They're upstairs, okay?

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:12.934
I'm gonna lead,

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:15.436
and I need you to follow behind

01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:16.971
and guard us with this, okay?

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:18.372
Can you do that?

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:19.974
Okay.

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:41.963
Do I...

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.732
I...

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:49.904
Do I... know you?

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.808
Ow, what...

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.209
Sss.
Ow. Ow.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:16:59.180
Ow.

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:00.381
Ow.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:01.816
What's your name?

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:30.177
They're just like little kids.

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:47.962
Mona?

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:51.666
Kyser?

01:17:51.668 --> 01:17:54.669
Mona Kyser?
The Kysers?

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:57.271
It is the kids from the house.

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:02.343
We were in first grade
together.

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:04.779
Right?

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.881
Mona!

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:10.284
Uh, we're not here
to hurt you guys.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:14.355
We're just... We just
want our friend back, okay?

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.590
We actually... We know
exactly who you are.

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:18.759
You're Mona,
and you're Frankie.

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:21.295
And, um, we're not...
We're not here to hurt you.

01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:23.898
We... We heard. We know
what happened to you.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.367
We know that... that
what happened to you

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:28.602
is far worse than anything
that your parents,

01:18:28.604 --> 01:18:31.338
your family
was ever accused of.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.740
You're not Satanists.

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:34.008
You're just...

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:36.811
really messed up.

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:38.779
And... that's
not your fault.

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:40.314
We just want to help you.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:43.250
And if you would just
please put the ax down.

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:46.053
Gwen, I need you
to fucking shoot him!

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:49.356
Gwen!

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:52.226
No!

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.806
Enough!

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:42.243
Please kill me.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.478
Please.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.781
Please, please.

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:49.183
Please kill me.

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:52.253
Please, please.

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.864
You're my best friend.

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:29.824
Come on.

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:38.732
Right by the bridge,

01:20:38.734 --> 01:20:39.967
could lay down.

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:41.869
Come on!
We gotta go!

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:43.370
I can take a nap.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:47.208
Nope. Up you go.

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:33.220
Lance.

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.890
You fucking bitch!

01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:33.567
Uh...

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.737
Can I have the keys?

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:43.253
