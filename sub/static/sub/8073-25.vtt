[tone]

00:03.737 --> 00:06.540
[music playing]

00:11.812 --> 00:12.680
Did you see anybody?

00:12.713 --> 00:14.515
No, no prowler.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.385
Listen, next time you hear
something, don't call me.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.686
Call the police.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.388
They're specially trained to
deal with people like you.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.359
Maybe the guy made
it into the basement,

00:25.393 --> 00:28.896
and he's just hiding out
till the coast is clear.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.265
You'd have to break a window
to get into the basement.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.134
Did you hear a window break?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.502
No.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.139
but maybe he attached a
suction cup to the window

00:38.172 --> 00:41.375
pane, cut a circle around it.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.910
And he silently
removed the glass.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.178
And then he climbed in.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.317
I didn't think of that.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.621
You better take that.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.356
No, no, no, no.
You keep it.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.290
You need it more than I do.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.726
I have my sanity to protect me.

00:58.759 --> 00:59.560
Careful.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.369
Be careful down there, Dan.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.504
I just oiled that
12-gauge last night.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.740
The action's real hot.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.208
- Jackie!
- What?

01:14.242 --> 01:15.042
Shut up!

01:17.411 --> 01:18.946
You see anything?

01:18.979 --> 01:20.748
Nothing.
Oh, wait a minute.

01:20.781 --> 01:21.649
What's this?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.417
What?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.686
Dan?

01:25.719 --> 01:26.487
What do you see?

01:29.923 --> 01:31.325
Dan!

01:31.359 --> 01:35.596
If you are able to, answer me!

01:35.629 --> 01:37.398
Your water heater is leaking.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.301
A joint's got to be replaced.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.069
Um.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.305
How does someone do that?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.806
Same way they
do anything else.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.808
They ask their brother-in-law
to do it for them!

01:47.841 --> 01:53.414
[doorbell]

01:53.447 --> 01:54.315
What's going on?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.383
I saw Dan's truck outside.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.450
I thought I heard a burglar.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.485
Really?

01:57.518 --> 01:58.686
Yeah, but it was
just a false alarm.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.091
Um, you know I was home.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.025
No.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.694
So you needed a
man to protect you.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.396
And you called Dan.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.797
Well, I was scared.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.165
It was just instinct.

02:11.199 --> 02:14.235
And your instinct
was to call Dan?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.603
Fred, my God!

02:15.636 --> 02:17.838
You know, I'm sorry I called
Dan, because I heard a burglar.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.139
And by the way, I'm fine.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.075
And so is your child,
thanks for asking.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.777
Hey, Fred, I'm going
to need a wrench.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.845
What do you need a wrench for?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.814
Your water heater's leaking.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.715
I'll fix it.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.049
No I'm already greasy.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.851
No sense in both of us having
to wash our hands tonight.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.453
No, really.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.255
I'll fix it.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.690
Knock yourself out.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.058
I've got to get home anyway.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.360
It's graham cracker night.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.199
Why don't you just let
Dan fix the water heater?

02:45.233 --> 02:46.300
He's the one that installed it.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.201
Right.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.035
and it's leaking.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.172
[baby crying]

02:52.206 --> 02:54.107
Why are you so angry?

02:54.141 --> 02:55.243
Oh, gee, I don't know.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.844
Maybe there's nothing
to be angry about.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.546
I guess Dan should
just fix the leak,

02:58.579 --> 03:00.781
and I should just shut up.

03:00.814 --> 03:06.254
Oh, see, my milk
is coming out.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.388
Can't you hold it?

03:07.421 --> 03:08.589
Yes.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.292
Fred, and I can also write
my name in the carpet.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.662
When did that happen?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.163
You woke the baby.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.766
He started crying,
and now I'm leaking.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.201
Oh, well, hang on.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.437
I'll get Dan.

03:23.471 --> 03:27.341
[music playing]

04:05.613 --> 04:07.581
[laughter]

04:07.615 --> 04:10.484
[music playing]

04:16.557 --> 04:17.825
What are you doing?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.360
Ah, moving the couch
to see how much room

04:19.393 --> 04:20.428
we have for the wedding.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.261
OK.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.635
Honey.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.236
You know, Dan, I've
been telling you all week,

04:29.269 --> 04:32.973
I got a really bad feeling
about this wedding.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.174
Mrs. Conner.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.110
David, sometimes it's
easier to move Mrs. Conner

04:37.144 --> 04:38.078
than it is to argue with her.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.518
Oh, God, look at that!

04:44.552 --> 04:45.453
A clean spot.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.725
I always thought we
had indoor outdoor.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.562
This here is shag!

04:54.595 --> 04:55.863
Don't worry, honey.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.665
We'll just cover the rest
of the floor with furniture,

04:57.698 --> 05:00.334
and everyone will think
we got new carpeting.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.503
Oh, Dan, Jackie
cannot have her wedding

05:02.536 --> 05:04.638
in a room with a clean spot.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.475
This just proves that my
bad feeling was right.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.577
This is a sign.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.678
I know it is, dear.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.614
But we agreed we'd wait
for a really big sign,

05:13.647 --> 05:15.215
something more
concrete before you

05:15.248 --> 05:16.817
went and wrecked Jackie's life.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.852
Oh, really, big sign, Dan.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.787
What do you think of this?

05:19.820 --> 05:23.757
God almighty has
marked our carpet.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.125
I just had a shock.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.894
I mean this carpet thing would
upset anybody, right, David?

05:26.927 --> 05:27.795
Uh.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.298
Yeah, I'm troubled by it.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.602
Honey, why don't you just
take a nice, hot bath and relax?

05:34.635 --> 05:35.669
And you'll see.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.337
Jackie's wedding will
be a big success.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.541
And Jackie will live
happily ever after.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.977
Do not talk down to me
like one of those husbands

05:44.011 --> 05:45.613
who is not afraid of his wife.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.249
Calgon's under the sink.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.287
Mr. Conner, do
you think is part

05:54.321 --> 05:58.058
of that change of life thing?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.427
Oh, if only this
were a change.

06:02.295 --> 06:08.636
[music playing]

06:14.007 --> 06:15.108
Hey, man.
Sorry I'm late.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.510
Looks like I'm going to
have to have a couple

06:16.544 --> 06:17.745
beers to catch up with you.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.646
Six.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.014
Wow.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.584
anyway, let's talk about
the bachelor party.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.053
Now the women have forbidden
from getting a stripper.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.855
So we're going to have to
hire one of them nude models,

06:27.888 --> 06:29.690
from the art school and
teach her how dance.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.290
Hold it.
Hold it.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.525
Hold it.
Hold it.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.261
There's not going to
be any bachelor party.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.496
Oh.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.198
of course, there's not going
to be a bachelor party.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.199
I gotcha.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.934
Anyway, I heard about
this Shari Lewis

06:40.968 --> 06:44.004
look-alike who does something
incredible with Lamb Chop.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.773
I'm serious, Dan.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.142
I'm not even sure there's
going to be a wedding.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.644
What?

06:50.678 --> 06:51.945
Relax.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.814
Most guys get nervous
before their wedding.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.216
I think they call it
the moment of clarity.

06:56.249 --> 07:00.053
I'm tired of pretending that
I'm the one she really wants.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.289
Oh man, it's just cold feet.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.558
There's another guy.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.026
She sees him almost every day.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.096
I'm not stupid.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.332
Oh, right, you don't
know Leon that well.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.635
Let me tell you--

07:14.668 --> 07:16.203
It's not Leon, OK.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.204
It's not Leon.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.107
It's you.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.975
Me?

07:22.009 --> 07:23.944
Are you kidding?

07:23.977 --> 07:27.881
My wife's not even
interested in me.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.518
You have no idea
how she talks about.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.986
It's like you're the ideal man.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.221
And no other guys
can live up to you.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.356
Come on, man.
You're talking stupid.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.925
She thinks you're like a god.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.364
All right, look, maybe a long
time ago, when we first met.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.200
But that's a 20
year crush on me.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.402
Come on, I'm not that great.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.771
Hey, can we have some
pretzels here, Honey?

07:57.678 --> 08:00.013
You know, nobody
even talks about it,

08:00.047 --> 08:03.884
because it's like the biggest,
dirtiest secret in the family.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.386
And I happen to know
that you love it.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.822
I do not love it.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.258
I'm not saying it's
not flattering.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.527
God, please, you know,
you totally egg her on.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.228
That's why she's always
having to ask you to come

08:15.262 --> 08:16.964
over and fix the same stuff.

08:16.997 --> 08:17.865
I don't egg her on.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.268
I just do sloppy work.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.970
Hey, next time she
has you over to help,

08:23.003 --> 08:26.373
just cut out the middleman
and get into bed with her.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.141
That's enough.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.810
Like I'm telling you
right now, I would

08:29.843 --> 08:31.211
never take advantage of that.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.446
And I'm surprised you're even
talking like this about her.

08:33.480 --> 08:38.251
Well, that's right, because
you're Jackie's big protector.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.420
OK, we're cutting you off.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.354
I'm going to drive you home.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.890
Get your hands off of me.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.892
OK, fine.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.093
But you're not
going to drive home.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.697
Yeah, well, neither are you.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.864
It's OK.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.165
He's getting married
in a couple of days.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.774
Somebody call on
a cab, would you?

09:00.808 --> 09:04.211
[music playing]

09:04.244 --> 09:10.918
[music playing]

09:10.951 --> 09:11.819
Hey.

09:11.852 --> 09:12.720
Hey, Jackie.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.988
Hey, Jackie.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.256
Dan, you know
what's up with Fred?

09:16.289 --> 09:17.457
Because I just
dropped the baby off.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.727
And he's being really snippy.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.595
No. no, no, no idea.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.296
I don't what's going on.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.065
He's like this all
the time lately.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.567
Things have gotten really
bad between the two of us.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.069
Oh, Jackie, I don't
think you and me should

09:29.102 --> 09:30.337
be talking about you and Fred.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.438
Why?

09:31.471 --> 09:32.806
Did he say something
last night at the Lobo?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.308
No, it's just I don't want
to get in the middle of this.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.677
I mean, Fred's like
my best friend.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.046
And you and me, I mean we're
practically related, at least

09:39.079 --> 09:40.413
that's how I look at it.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.382
My God, what
happened to your face?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.617
Nothing.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.219
I just bumped into
Roseanne's elbow.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.187
Apparently, I was snoring.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.259
She really caught you one.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.160
Yeah, it's OK.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.061
Just, OK.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.528
It's all right.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.630
Hey.

09:56.664 --> 09:59.066
Hey, she was just
looking at my face.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.669
That's all.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.236
I thought you and
Fred were going to go

10:03.270 --> 10:04.237
ring shopping this morning.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.572
Well, I don't know.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.875
We might not even need rings,
because according to Fred,

10:07.908 --> 10:09.342
there might not
even be a wedding.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.044
He actually said that to me.

10:11.078 --> 10:11.945
Really?

10:11.979 --> 10:12.846
Yeah.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.715
But it's just cold feet, right?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.249
I mean, people say crazy
things all the time

10:16.283 --> 10:17.150
before they get married.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.285
Nothing to worry about, right?

10:21.889 --> 10:23.290
What?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.759
I think you should
postpone the wedding.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.295
What? are you serious?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.163
Yeah, I've had a really bad
feeling about it all week.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.565
But I just couldn't get to you,
because Dan kept me in the tub.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.437
Well, what do you think, Dan?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.506
Don't ask him!

10:39.539 --> 10:41.408
I think you should
cancel the wedding.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.344
What?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.313
It could be that
Fred's problem is that he

10:46.346 --> 10:48.749
senses that you have a problem.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.984
And maybe you're questioning
things, because you still have

10:51.018 --> 10:56.289
some feelings about the past.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.590
About someone from the past.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.761
And Fred just
doesn't measure up.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.466
Yeah, right, Dan.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.435
We'll call you if we
ever need some gibberish.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.306
Well, thanks a lot, you two.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.042
I had about that
much confidence.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.877
And you just stomped
on it and stomped

11:16.910 --> 11:18.645
on it till it's all gone.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.313
Well, if you don't
want our opinion.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.715
I don't want your opinion.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.383
I'm going to find somebody who
will tell me getting married is

11:23.416 --> 11:25.986
a good idea, even if it isn't.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.156
I'm going to ask Mom.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.125
Man, I hope she's
not making a mistake.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.361
Well, what made
you change your mind?

11:34.394 --> 11:35.996
First you treat me
like a nut case.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.530
And now you agree with me.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.966
I ought to put you in the tub.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.870
All right, I'll tell you.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.173
But you've got to promise me you
won't think any less of Jackie.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.540
Go on.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.542
All right, last night Fred
told me something about the way

11:49.576 --> 11:51.711
Jackie feels about me.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.346
And what way was that?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.414
Look, it's no big deal.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.150
It's just one of
those crush things

11:57.184 --> 11:59.586
that a younger sister has on
an older sister's husband.

12:04.858 --> 12:12.866
So you think Jackie
has a crush on you?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.467
Just a little crush.
It's only natural.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.941
You are out of
your clod-hopping,

12:20.974 --> 12:24.577
consarned, egg-sucking mind.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.379
Well, Fred thinks it's true.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.149
Oh, well then.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.384
He took a swing
at me last night.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.586
He told me Jackie
thinks I'm like a god.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.488
Well, that's just because
you never do nothing on Sunday.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.527
Think about it.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.163
She's always asking me
over there to fix stuff.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.564
Wow.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.199
And so is my mom.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.502
Oh my God, my entire family's
got the hots for you, Dan.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.571
And Leon wants to come
over and fix that pipe.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.306
You better look out, hot stuff.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.543
You just don't believe it.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.379
Jackie has never said
one thing about that to me.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.915
Of course she wouldn't
say anything to you.

13:01.949 --> 13:02.749
I'm your man.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.390
You're a gigantic fool.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.892
OK, you go ahead.

13:11.925 --> 13:12.792
You think I'm a fool.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.595
But at least, I'm not selfish.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.164
I'm not selfish.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.833
It's so obvious what
you're doing, Roseanne.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.701
You don't want Jackie to be
married, because then you'd

13:21.734 --> 13:23.871
have to share her with Fred.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.372
You want to keep
her all to yourself,

13:25.405 --> 13:27.407
even though it means
she'll never be happy.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.009
You are so wrong.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.278
I mean, you are just
so completely wrong.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.846
If you are were
any wronger at all,

13:32.880 --> 13:35.082
you would be in the Guinness
Book of World Records

13:35.115 --> 13:39.252
under world's wrongest man.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.155
No, I got that title
the day I married you.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.058
[music playing]

13:48.128 --> 13:50.964
[doorbell]

13:55.535 --> 13:58.038
So how are you doing?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.239
Not good.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.974
I called up Fred, and I
told him to come on over,

14:01.008 --> 14:02.943
because you and Dan are right.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.344
If he has this many
doubts about it,

14:04.377 --> 14:06.446
then maybe we
shouldn't be married.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.015
I think you better think
about this some more.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.249
I have been.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.851
And I'm starting to see
Fred for what he really is.

14:11.885 --> 14:16.656
Scared, indecisive,
emotionally unpredictable.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.026
And I don't want to be
married to somebody like me.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.232
No, you should
marry Fred, Jackie.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.833
And you wouldn't be
having all these doubts

14:26.866 --> 14:30.270
if you hadn't been influenced by
the very worst person on earth.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.907
Oh, Roseanne, Mom
wants me to be married.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.775
No, not mom.

14:35.808 --> 14:36.676
Me.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.577
I'm evil.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.445
And I must be stopped.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.120
I'm very confused.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.957
Well, it was always that I
was the one that had the kids

14:49.990 --> 14:51.358
and was married
to the great guy.

14:51.391 --> 14:56.063
And now if you're going to get
married, well, we'll be tied.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.330
So you told me
not to marry Fred,

14:57.364 --> 14:59.866
because you don't
want us to be tied?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.368
Yeah, because you
know if we're tied,

15:01.401 --> 15:02.835
then we'll be equal.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.572
And then you won't
need me anymore.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.407
Oh, Roseanne.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.341
I kn ow.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.409
I'm so stupid.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.310
I'm just hideous.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.680
Don't even look at me.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.815
Well, of course
I will need you.

15:15.848 --> 15:19.019
Even with Fred, my
life is messed up.

15:19.052 --> 15:22.655
Oh, you're just saying
that to make me feel better.

15:22.689 --> 15:23.590
I'm not.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.326
I'm still stuck
in a dead end job.

15:26.359 --> 15:30.630
Well, that's true.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.799
I have no confidence
in my skills as a mother.

15:32.832 --> 15:33.833
So I really need you there.

15:33.866 --> 15:34.734
Well, that's true.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.971
I am a damn good mother.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.008
I'm going to be proud of
the way David turned out.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.779
And you got me out of that
Fisher relationship mess.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.315
You got me started dating Fred.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.017
And if it weren't
for you, I probably

15:50.050 --> 15:52.685
wouldn't be headed toward
a life better than yours.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.755
I said, tied.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.224
Well, it's pointless
anyway because Fred

15:57.257 --> 15:59.559
doesn't want me anymore.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.994
Oh, he wants you, Jackie.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.863
He's just thinking all
screwy, 'cause you know what?

16:03.896 --> 16:06.066
He thinks you have
the hots for Dan.

16:06.099 --> 16:06.899
What?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.402
[laughter]

16:09.436 --> 16:12.605
And they had this great big
fight about it at the Lobo

16:12.639 --> 16:13.506
last night.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.508
Fred thinks that?

16:15.542 --> 16:16.476
He thinks that?

16:16.509 --> 16:17.444
Yeah.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.146
and you know what's
even scarier?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.014
Dan thinks it, too.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.416
[laughter]

16:23.450 --> 16:27.554
[knocking]

16:27.587 --> 16:29.689
Oh, hi, Fred.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.623
Oh, hi.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.426
Oh, hi.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.861
Look, Jackie, I'm
really glad you called,

16:34.894 --> 16:36.829
because we need to talk.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.632
Roseanne, can you
leave us alone?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.933
Well, no, Fred.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.569
I don't need to, because I
know what this is all about.

16:45.105 --> 16:45.972
You do?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.507
Yes.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.941
Dan and Jackie.

16:48.975 --> 16:49.776
Oh man.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.480
Yeah, I know.

16:58.017 --> 17:02.155
I guess I've always known.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.323
Oh, Roseanne.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.262
I just don't think I can
go through with all this

17:09.296 --> 17:12.031
knowing how Jackie
feels about Dan.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.433
I don't blame
you at all, Fred.

17:13.466 --> 17:18.505
I don't really see how any
of us can get through this.

17:18.538 --> 17:24.777
That is why I agreed
to step aside and let

17:24.811 --> 17:26.045
Jackie and Dan be together.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.585
What?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.722
As part of that bargain,
you shall be mine.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.098
[music playing]

17:49.669 --> 17:50.603
Hey.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.704
Hey.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.240
Roseanne wanted me to
give this to Jackie.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.775
Oh, why, those'll look great.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.876
Yeah, I wore
them at my wedding.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.315
Dan, I--

18:02.349 --> 18:03.616
Yeah, I know.
Me too.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.252
I mean, it was just the
wedding and everything.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.286
Yeah, I know.
I know.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.458
Fred, what do you
do with your arms?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.730
I'm just shaking hands

18:34.747 --> 18:35.715
Is he gone?

18:35.748 --> 18:37.884
Yeah.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.019
Wow, great dress.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.454
Great you.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.490
Thanks.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.924
Yeah, Roseanne wanted
me to give you this.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.058
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.228
Listen, I know she had
that dumb idea about me

18:48.261 --> 18:49.262
walking you down the aisle.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.797
But if you'd rather go alone.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.064
No, Dan, no.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.633
I think it's a great idea.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.803
I mean, you did
take a punch for me.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.771
Well, I wish Rosie hadn't
told you everything about that.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.072
Oh, it's all right.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.241
I'm not embarrassed.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.375
Well, of course not.

19:02.409 --> 19:06.246
You're not a big goon
that believed it all.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.649
Dan, I might not
have a crush on you.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.284
But I think you're
an incredible guy.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.253
I have been out
with so many jerks.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.388
And if I didn't know that there
were guys like you out there,

19:15.422 --> 19:19.326
I would have given up
on men a long time ago.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.761
Yeah?
really?

19:21.794 --> 19:25.265
So I mean in your eyes.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.098
I'm the perfect man.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.503
More like a god.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.143
Man, did she have to
tell you everything?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.078
Move it, you two.

19:43.950 --> 19:44.784
Are you ready?

19:44.817 --> 19:45.618
I think so.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.356
Sounds like your son's
ready for you, too.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.726
Oh, no!

19:53.760 --> 19:55.628
What?

19:55.662 --> 19:56.896
Oh.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.064
I'm leaking!

19:58.097 --> 19:58.898
Oh!

20:01.268 --> 20:02.502
Well, it's not noticeable.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.373
Oh, I had no reason to
think that they would go well.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.442
I mean I'm only really
worried do it for 37 years.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.478
Oh, come on, Jackie.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.780
Hey, can't you
just go like this?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.285
Dan, when
something is leaking,

20:18.318 --> 20:22.154
you don't apply pressure to it.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.956
All right, well, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Whoa, whoa.

20:23.990 --> 20:24.524
I have an idea.
I've got an idea.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.292
Wait a minute.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.029
An original creation by Mr. Dan.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.967
It's not bad.

20:35.001 --> 20:35.802
Shall we?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.741
Dan, it wasn't
Roseanne's idea for you

20:41.774 --> 20:42.675
to walk me down the aisle.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.544
It was mine.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.045
You want me.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.448
[music playing]

20:51.984 --> 20:55.855
Fred, do you take Jackie to
be your lawfully wedded wife?

20:55.888 --> 20:56.823
I do.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.491
And, Jackie do
you take Fred to be

20:58.525 --> 21:00.627
your lawfully wedded husband?

21:00.660 --> 21:04.564
I do. - By the power vested
in me by the state of Illinois,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.533
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.868
You may kiss the bride.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.036
Just let me
switch sides first.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.047
I suppose you're
next, Darlene.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.683
Uh, no, thank you I drink
my milk from a glass now.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.454
OK, now.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.895
