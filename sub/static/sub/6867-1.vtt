WEBVTT

00:04.058 --> 00:06.064
So if you want paper towels in there,

00:06.132 --> 00:08.440
you'll just have to supply your own.

00:09.779 --> 00:11.317
Where do you get paper towels?

00:11.385 --> 00:16.035
And, last item, on a related note,
I have no choice but to cut salaries.

00:17.407 --> 00:20.216
Eight percent, across the board!

00:20.284 --> 00:21.722
And let's just put a lid on it!

00:21.790 --> 00:23.930
Do we have to supply our own lids?

00:23.998 --> 00:25.837
Look, I didn't invent the economy!

00:25.905 --> 00:28.981
And until Isis gets in the black,
we all have to make some

00:29.049 --> 00:31.926
sacrifices, so...
Line one for you.

00:31.993 --> 00:33.097
It's your furrier.

00:33.164 --> 00:34.937
Unbelievable!

00:35.004 --> 00:38.592
We have to cut back but
you're buying new horseshoes?

00:39.789 --> 00:42.189
Tell him to send over the gray fox.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.802
See? Sacrifice.

00:43.870 --> 00:46.512
At this rate I'll be
reduced to wearing nutria.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.054
On your horse with
his fancy new shoes.

00:49.122 --> 00:51.061
Oh for the...
That's a farrier!

00:51.130 --> 00:51.764
I know.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.240
And this...
Is Konrad Schlotz.

00:54.308 --> 00:57.731
Herr Schlotz controls all of
Europe's Videotex services.

00:57.851 --> 00:58.811
Videotex?

00:58.931 --> 01:02.069
Wow, growth industry...
So he's worth billions.

01:02.137 --> 01:05.313
And I want to convince
him to invest in Isis.

01:05.381 --> 01:07.857
Well that's gonna be a tough sell...

01:07.924 --> 01:11.402
We've posted losses for
fifteen straight quarters, so...

01:11.471 --> 01:15.719
So that's why you're going to cook up
a different set of books, Cyril.

01:15.786 --> 01:18.395
Ooh no, I'm not comfortable with that.

01:18.463 --> 01:21.285
Think you'd be more comfortable
on another little vacation?

01:21.405 --> 01:22.693
Upstairs?

01:22.813 --> 01:25.837
No, I was dating Lana
but since I suffer from sexual addiction,

01:25.957 --> 01:27.896
which these
quacks deny is even real,

01:27.964 --> 01:30.673
now they're treating
me for... Can somebody!

01:30.741 --> 01:31.643
Please!

01:31.711 --> 01:33.960
Shut up that damn coyote?

01:34.192 --> 01:35.381
Clormatrazapam?

01:35.501 --> 01:37.598
No. No I would not.

01:37.666 --> 01:40.465
So unless you want me send you back...
I will start cooking the books.

01:40.585 --> 01:42.078
Good thing you know how to cheat.

01:42.198 --> 01:43.909
Hey, ya know what?
Enough!

01:44.155 --> 01:46.932
Now then, this is a
two-prong operation.

01:47.001 --> 01:51.181
The books are prong one, while
prong two is El Frente Rojo.

01:51.249 --> 01:52.754
Derby day, wore that exact same hat.

01:52.874 --> 01:53.824
Shock!

01:53.892 --> 01:56.667
Herr Schlotz fears they may
attempt a kidnapping during

01:56.735 --> 01:59.255
a birthday party he's throwing
this weekend in Gstaad...

01:59.375 --> 02:01.318
Ach, Gstaad!

02:01.386 --> 02:03.376
- Oh yeah, count me in!
- And me out.

02:03.496 --> 02:06.303
I'm not getting frostbite
protecting some old German guy.

02:06.371 --> 02:08.544
Herr Schlotz isn't
the intended victim.

02:08.612 --> 02:11.522
It's his daughter, Anka...
Who obviously needs

02:11.590 --> 02:14.466
someone on her constantly, and
so I will be that someone,

02:14.534 --> 02:16.239
who is constantly on her!

02:17.947 --> 02:20.856
For God's sake, Sterling,
she's turning seventeen!

02:20.923 --> 02:22.997
Oh, eww!
Sorry, even for you Archer...

02:23.065 --> 02:25.640
C'mon, she doesn't look like
she's just turning seventeen!

02:25.708 --> 02:27.773
No, she looks like she's
just turning eighteen.

02:27.893 --> 02:28.886
Exactly.

02:28.953 --> 02:31.093
Plus Europeans use the
metric system, which...

02:31.162 --> 02:36.145
Sterling Malory Archer, you
will not touch a single hair on that girl.

02:36.213 --> 02:39.290
I... See?
How I just let that go by?

02:39.357 --> 02:39.926
Look at me.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.170
I'm the perfect gentleman.

03:18.541 --> 03:21.248
No.
This is completely unacceptable.

03:21.315 --> 03:23.553
Cutbacks, I get it, but
you cannot expect me to

03:23.621 --> 03:25.184
share a room with Ray.

03:25.304 --> 03:29.009
Aw, I'll be gentle...
Mother! You know what he's implying, right?

03:29.129 --> 03:31.059
Stop whining, we're all making do.

03:31.179 --> 03:33.881
Why, I'm sharing a room with Lana...
Hooray...

03:33.949 --> 03:35.351
And Pam's sleeping in the cellar.

03:35.419 --> 03:38.293
Yeah, and if money's so damn
tight, why is she even here?

03:38.413 --> 03:41.033
Eh, she's making me mule
back a buncha this crap...

03:41.101 --> 03:43.406
That "crap" is three
hundred dollars a bottle,

03:43.474 --> 03:46.447
and you can't get it in
America, so not another sip!

03:46.516 --> 03:48.386
And the rest of you, make
room in your luggage for

03:48.454 --> 03:49.690
ten liters apiece.

03:49.757 --> 03:53.031
Unbelievable...
I know, what kind of limit is that?

03:53.099 --> 03:56.073
Ah gut, you are here, Frau Archer!

03:56.141 --> 03:56.942
Ah ah ah!

03:57.010 --> 03:58.514
It's Fraulein Archer!

03:58.581 --> 04:01.688
She added, desperately...
And these are my top agents,

04:01.756 --> 04:06.368
who are ready to lay down their
lives to protect your, um...

04:06.435 --> 04:07.370
Lovely daughter.

04:07.437 --> 04:11.247
Let's hope it doesn't come to that...
Ja, but if it does...

04:11.572 --> 04:12.172
Let's hope not.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.770
You must protect my princess.

04:14.890 --> 04:18.779
Anka is all I have in the world
since her mother passed away.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.558
Oh, you poor thing.

04:20.588 --> 04:22.575
- You're a widower?
- Oh, like you didn't KNOW!

04:22.853 --> 04:24.098
No! No!

04:24.299 --> 04:26.808
- What is wrong with you?
- Did no one just see that?

04:26.837 --> 04:31.866
Jumpy, eh? Truly, *** has not frightened
the famous Sterling Archer.

04:31.986 --> 04:33.217
No, she does!

04:33.247 --> 04:35.968
- My Anka? What do you mean?
- Oh, right!

04:36.149 --> 04:38.641
Yeah, Archer, Anka is dirty sexy.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.509
- What?
- Sterling!

04:39.675 --> 04:41.350
She is only 16!

04:41.395 --> 04:42.849
- I...
- Oh, schwein!

04:42.908 --> 04:44.440
No, I know! I'm not.

04:44.482 --> 04:46.089
- Don't come near her again.
- Come on!

04:46.132 --> 04:48.092
And the rest of you, get to work.

04:48.295 --> 04:49.301
Come, Anka!

04:50.533 --> 04:52.665
Oh, hell, I hope you're happy.

04:52.766 --> 04:54.185
No, I'm not, mother.

04:54.365 --> 04:56.127
I just got fingered.

04:56.248 --> 04:59.415
You know, that is just... ewwh.

04:59.653 --> 05:01.721
Just thanks a lot, Bitch and Sundance.

05:01.863 --> 05:02.263
- What?
- What?

05:02.290 --> 05:03.819
What what? Didn't you see that?

05:03.847 --> 05:05.956
I saw you totally, eye-banged a teenager.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.907
No you didn't, because I wasn't!

05:08.062 --> 05:10.221
- Whatever.
- Go, wash up, dirty bird.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.757
- I wasn't eye-banging her.
- Man, I was.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.520
What? Geez, I'm only human!

05:18.075 --> 05:19.133
Are you?

05:20.164 --> 05:21.568
Ay, that stinks.

05:21.635 --> 05:24.208
So don't smell it, don't smell it.

05:24.275 --> 05:28.017
Another perfect example of
your reductive reasoning!

05:28.086 --> 05:29.489
Basta, queridos!

05:29.556 --> 05:30.692
Que es esto?

05:30.760 --> 05:31.393
He started it.

05:31.461 --> 05:35.003
Can't I leave you two alone for even
one hour without you going at it?

05:35.071 --> 05:38.211
I should have asked myself the
same thing about you two...

05:38.279 --> 05:39.014
Meaning what?

05:39.082 --> 05:41.219
Meaning you left me for my brother!

05:41.287 --> 05:42.524
Your twin brother.

05:42.591 --> 05:46.233
So obviously I still find
you very attractive.

05:46.301 --> 05:48.238
And I have good news!

05:48.306 --> 05:51.313
Even though Sterling Archer
is here in Gstaad...

05:51.381 --> 05:53.051
Archer?! Ay, dios mio!

05:53.119 --> 05:56.427
It won't be a problem to
kidnap that bourgeois perrita.

05:56.495 --> 05:58.867
Her father has forbidden
Archer to go near her!

05:58.935 --> 06:00.270
So then we go with my plan.

06:00.338 --> 06:02.510
Your plan stinks more
than that cheese.

06:02.578 --> 06:04.916
I think that smell is them.

06:04.984 --> 06:08.492
But even they smell better
than your stupid plan.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.829
We go with my plan.

06:09.897 --> 06:11.032
Fine.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.263
You don't want the world's
greatest secret agent on the case?

06:13.383 --> 06:14.207
Fine!

06:14.275 --> 06:17.416
You want little countess Von
Fingerbang to get kidnapped?

06:17.484 --> 06:18.085
Fine!

06:18.152 --> 06:20.391
Oh oh oh, and as for you, Ray...!

06:20.459 --> 06:26.172
Sterling Archer may be many
things, but he's not... Fine?

06:26.240 --> 06:29.247
Oh, I think he is very fine...
Hey no no, Anka,

06:29.315 --> 06:30.585
you can't be in here!

06:30.653 --> 06:33.025
Anka?
Mr. Archer, how familiar you are.

06:33.092 --> 06:37.202
You must address me by title...
Countess Von Fingerbang.

06:37.270 --> 06:37.971
Noooope!

06:38.039 --> 06:40.244
C'mon Anka, seriously, you
seriously gotta get outta

06:40.312 --> 06:43.252
here before... Shit!
Before the cops show up, or... Wait,

06:43.320 --> 06:45.257
what do you have in Switzerland,
some kinda pikemen?

06:45.325 --> 06:47.430
I don't know...
I am from Germany.

06:47.497 --> 06:50.838
Where the age of consent is fourteen.

06:50.906 --> 06:52.543
What is it, the Alabama of Europe?

06:52.610 --> 06:56.086
In many ways yes, but...
We can talk about that in bed.

06:56.153 --> 06:56.887
No we can't!

06:56.955 --> 07:00.263
Seriously you have to...
Hand over the girl, cochino!

07:00.331 --> 07:04.943
And that is just it for today, on
people calling me a frickin pig!

07:10.224 --> 07:13.064
Holy shit, did you see that?

07:13.132 --> 07:14.635
I saw you save my life!

07:14.703 --> 07:18.478
No, I... Well maybe a little, and
I know just how to repay you!

07:18.546 --> 07:19.448
Wait no no no!

07:19.516 --> 07:21.186
Bad touch, bad touch!

07:21.254 --> 07:22.856
You... schwein!

07:22.925 --> 07:25.297
So, does this look as bad as it looks?

07:25.365 --> 07:27.937
I will let the gendarmes decide that!

07:28.005 --> 07:31.278
Oh, so they're not pikemen...
Wait! Anka, tell your father what happened.

07:31.398 --> 07:34.968
Papa, he lured me. And then he tried
to touch me with his...

07:35.088 --> 07:36.025
Wilhelm!

07:36.094 --> 07:37.763
No, I saved her life!

07:37.831 --> 07:39.769
Look, I set a kidnapper on fire!

07:39.837 --> 07:41.907
Tell it to the gendarmes!

07:41.975 --> 07:43.612
Schwein!

07:43.680 --> 07:45.684
Oh c'mon, did you not just see that?

07:45.752 --> 07:47.957
Sterling, you promised!

07:48.024 --> 07:50.664
And yet here you stand,
as a fortune walks away,

07:50.732 --> 07:54.141
with your wedding tackle
stuffed into your shaving kit!

07:54.456 --> 07:55.911
"Schwein."

07:55.980 --> 07:56.847
Doesn't even touch it.

07:56.915 --> 07:59.622
Yeah? Well neither did I, mother!
I saved her life!

07:59.689 --> 08:02.495
Go ask that dick I set on fire!

08:02.564 --> 08:06.206
And speaking of, that bay rum
really burns on the owww!

08:06.274 --> 08:07.576
Hello, razor!

08:07.644 --> 08:10.584
Welcome to the party!

08:10.652 --> 08:13.024
you, Switzerland.

08:15.227 --> 08:18.084
You're damn lucky Anka
convinced her father

08:18.140 --> 08:19.286
not to press charges.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.963
Yeah, I feel lucky. Let's see, sexually
assaulted by a teenage sociopath,

08:23.160 --> 08:24.854
interrogated by gendarmes.

08:24.981 --> 08:26.855
- Oh, three stitches on my penis.
- Uh.

08:26.934 --> 08:28.535
So... yeah, it's all breaking my way!

08:28.602 --> 08:30.304
Well just stay of my way.

08:30.372 --> 08:34.143
I have to convince Schlotz
to get in bed with Isis.

08:34.212 --> 08:37.582
And failing that, in bed with...
Don't! Say it.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.551
I'm in enough pain.

08:38.618 --> 08:41.688
Yeah, the entire hotel's
talking about your little shaving accident.

08:41.756 --> 08:44.862
Hooray... And if you wanna get
Schlotz into you... Phrasing!

08:44.930 --> 08:46.665
You better start eating strudel.

08:46.732 --> 08:49.168
Maaajor chubby chaser...
Well, a lot of that's muscle...

08:49.236 --> 08:51.306
Let's hope not...
Cause ya get pretty strong

08:51.373 --> 08:53.409
arms growing up on a dairy farm.

08:53.476 --> 08:54.778
A dairy farm?

08:54.845 --> 08:57.716
Yes, it was called Butterfat Ranch...
No it...

08:57.784 --> 08:59.352
And they had a big cheese-rodeo.

08:59.420 --> 09:03.459
It was poovey farms.
I also was raised on a dairy farm!

09:03.527 --> 09:04.695
Yer shitting me!

09:04.762 --> 09:06.029
What was yer breed?

09:06.098 --> 09:06.798
Friesianu!

09:06.865 --> 09:08.367
We had Holsteins!

09:08.435 --> 09:10.203
Jeez, they're like...
Cousins!

09:10.271 --> 09:14.872
Wow! Man, all this cow-talk is
making me thirsty for some milk.

09:14.992 --> 09:18.451
And as luck has it, there is
some chilling in my suite.

09:18.518 --> 09:20.954
Well let's get some!

09:21.022 --> 09:26.379
Don't wait up...
That is so classic her.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.300
Chasing a billionaire while
we could all be surrounded by

09:28.368 --> 09:30.671
terrorists, because we don't
even know what they look like!

09:30.739 --> 09:31.372
Well, spoiler alert:

09:31.439 --> 09:33.341
One of them doesn't have
any skin on his face.

09:33.410 --> 09:33.909
Meaning what?

09:33.977 --> 09:35.712
Meaning I set one of them on fire?

09:35.780 --> 09:39.018
Was that before or after you got
caught fondling a teenager?

09:39.085 --> 09:40.520
Well, obviously before!

09:40.588 --> 09:43.993
After was all...
Gendarmes and dick-stitches!

09:44.061 --> 09:48.668
Ugh... And I didn't touch her,
Lana, so there's no reason to be jealous!

09:48.735 --> 09:49.535
Whatever!

09:49.603 --> 09:51.371
How's your Wilhelm?
Aagh!

09:51.439 --> 09:53.409
Should I kiss it and make it better?

09:53.476 --> 09:55.345
No, you should get away from me!

09:55.413 --> 09:56.847
Look, I'm serious, you need help!

09:56.915 --> 09:58.417
You need help, Archer!

09:58.484 --> 09:59.619
She came up to me!

09:59.687 --> 10:02.757
Ray, what is a...
What did you call it?

10:02.825 --> 10:03.692
"Blow job?"

10:03.760 --> 10:04.260
What?

10:04.328 --> 10:05.061
Shame on you!

10:05.128 --> 10:06.296
Fie and shame!

10:06.364 --> 10:10.070
And it's something a grown-up
does when he loves another grown-up.

10:10.137 --> 10:13.442
Now raus, you mouse, get
ready for our ski lesson.

10:13.509 --> 10:15.011
She's giving you a ski lesson?

10:15.079 --> 10:16.513
No, I'm giving her one.

10:16.581 --> 10:18.183
Oh yeah right, I forgot
you won the Olympic

10:18.250 --> 10:20.052
gold medal in men's downhill.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.660
Well, ass, it was giant slalom...
And I only took bronze.

10:24.728 --> 10:26.597
So... you lost.

10:26.665 --> 10:28.633
Well, I came in third.

10:28.701 --> 10:30.103
Yeah, which is last.

10:30.170 --> 10:31.572
Which is third.

10:31.639 --> 10:32.874
In the world.

10:32.942 --> 10:34.377
You lost, Ray.

10:34.444 --> 10:37.482
Jesus, get over it.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.014
It actually was a huge disappointment.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.665
***

10:43.007 --> 10:45.194
Months of preparation ruined!

10:45.262 --> 10:48.366
How could you be so stupid?

10:48.434 --> 10:52.407
Carlito, he obviously did not
mean to get set on fire.

10:52.474 --> 10:53.942
We should have gone with my plan.

10:54.010 --> 10:56.914
Which was superior in every way!

10:56.982 --> 10:59.184
So then now we do your plan.

10:59.252 --> 11:00.920
My plan requires three people.

11:00.988 --> 11:04.527
Three people who have faces!

11:04.594 --> 11:05.060
Putamadre!

11:05.128 --> 11:07.532
Now I must call headquarters
for reinforcements.

11:07.599 --> 11:09.968
Good idea, mi amor.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.640
You are so clever.

11:12.707 --> 11:16.479
And sexy.

11:16.548 --> 11:19.184
That sounds like Schlotz, but...
Oh my God,

11:19.251 --> 11:21.020
Pam must be getting naked!

11:21.088 --> 11:23.891
All these idiots think about sex.

11:23.959 --> 11:25.494
It's called nymphomania.

11:25.562 --> 11:27.731
Maybe mixed with borderline
personality disorder,

11:27.799 --> 11:29.768
I mean I dunno, Lana,
I'm not a developmental

11:29.836 --> 11:32.439
psychologist, but...
Archer, I'm serious... I'm serious.

11:32.507 --> 11:33.341
That girl's a nightmare.

11:33.409 --> 11:36.111
No, a nightmare is sharing
a room with your mother,

11:36.179 --> 11:37.982
who expects me to...
Loofah, I know...

11:38.050 --> 11:39.885
Protect! Some eurotrash brat!

11:39.953 --> 11:41.988
Who's got about a jillion
guests coming to her stupid

11:42.056 --> 11:43.157
birthday party tomorrow!

11:43.225 --> 11:45.160
Yeah...
Think they're gonna have a band?

11:45.228 --> 11:45.928
Or just a DJ?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.397
I don't...
Why don't you go find out?

11:47.465 --> 11:48.600
No, I can't be alone.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.771
That's when she strikes,
like a slutty little ninja.

11:51.839 --> 11:53.107
Eww, is that Schlotz and Pam?

11:53.175 --> 11:54.910
And are they drinking anti-freeze?

11:54.978 --> 11:55.744
Let's hope.

11:55.812 --> 11:58.682
Ugh, change it, before I puke my...
Holy shit! Lana, look!

11:58.750 --> 12:00.520
That's the kidnapper I set on fire!

12:00.587 --> 12:01.153
That guy?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.422
Who's never been on fire?

12:02.490 --> 12:05.227
He was, though! Lana, I swear...
You swear?

12:05.295 --> 12:08.407
Like you swore about a
ninety-pound schoolgirl raping ya?

12:08.527 --> 12:12.357
Attempted rape, Lana, and that guy was
running around like Johnny Storm.

12:13.545 --> 12:16.005
AKA the human torch, Lana, duh!

12:16.125 --> 12:18.192
And if you don't believe me, fine...
Hey!

12:18.312 --> 12:20.145
I can take care of myself.
Ow!

12:20.265 --> 12:23.370
Oh, great, yeah,
go terrorize the bell hop.

12:24.113 --> 12:26.560
Good thing the gun was empty.
Oh, shit.

12:26.962 --> 12:28.753
God, I hate it when he's right.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.076
Now he gets to be the big hero who...

12:31.450 --> 12:33.008
has no bullets.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.849
Going against an unknown
number of radical terrorists

12:35.969 --> 12:37.777
armed with automatic weapons.

12:37.897 --> 12:39.061
So that's gonna...

12:39.367 --> 12:41.417
Ugh, dammit.

12:41.537 --> 12:43.672
Herr Schlotz, herr Schlotz!

12:43.792 --> 12:45.148
Are you in there?

12:45.399 --> 12:47.634
I need to ask you a tiny...

12:47.754 --> 12:50.313
My God, woman, can't you not read?

12:50.433 --> 12:52.136
Not without my glasses, so...

12:52.256 --> 12:54.496
I was hoping if you could read this to me...

12:54.616 --> 12:56.655
Perhaps in your suite over a drink...

12:56.775 --> 12:58.478
Yeah, come on in...

12:58.598 --> 13:01.266
Just making a fresh batch
of green Russians.

13:03.558 --> 13:05.393
Ow ow ow ow ow ow.

13:05.461 --> 13:07.697
First thing when I get back,
buying an electric razor.

13:07.765 --> 13:10.402
That's no fun...
Oh for [beep]'s sake!

13:10.470 --> 13:14.508
Then you don't get to squirt
that hot white cream all over your face.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.912
Why aren't you with Gillette?

13:16.980 --> 13:22.388
As the ski lift was coming, at
the last moment I jumped out of the way!

13:22.456 --> 13:25.662
Dukes, I am gonna be
in huge trouble...

13:28.198 --> 13:29.867
Right after I freeze to death.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.869
Double dukes!

13:30.936 --> 13:32.805
Oh great, they cut the power!

13:32.873 --> 13:36.512
How romantic...
Yeah it is.

13:36.579 --> 13:38.481
No, not romantic, dangerous!

13:38.549 --> 13:40.051
Because it's gonna be dark soon.

13:40.118 --> 13:43.614
So before it is too dark,
let me ask your opinion on

13:43.734 --> 13:46.729
something... What're you...
No no, re-zip, re-zip!

13:46.863 --> 13:49.273
Do you think I need a boob job?

13:50.257 --> 13:51.437
Honestly?

13:51.504 --> 13:51.870
Wh-?

13:51.938 --> 13:54.608
I'm kidding! Anka, c'mon, you're
gonna be a beautiful woman someday.

13:54.676 --> 13:55.042
Really?

13:55.110 --> 13:57.580
Yes, really. And literally,
the minute you turn eighteen

13:57.648 --> 14:00.250
please call me, but...
Save your minutes!

14:00.318 --> 14:03.122
Because tonight Sterling Archer dies!

14:03.190 --> 14:04.291
Oh yeah?

14:06.395 --> 14:07.896
Oh no.

14:07.965 --> 14:11.703
Don't shoot the girl, we need her!

14:11.771 --> 14:13.740
Archer, you must save me!

14:13.807 --> 14:14.708
Got any ideas?

14:14.776 --> 14:16.377
Because I'm all ears!

14:16.445 --> 14:19.549
Why don't we take that?

14:19.617 --> 14:22.370
Well obviously we're gonna take that.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.545
C'mon!

14:25.527 --> 14:26.328
Oh, Archer!

14:26.395 --> 14:27.730
We are safe now, ja?

14:27.798 --> 14:30.583
Well, it's a little early to say...

14:32.973 --> 14:35.213
But I really kinda doubt it.

14:39.265 --> 14:42.668
I mean, I'm sure I've
been in worse situations...

14:42.736 --> 14:45.580
But right now I'm kinda drawing
a blank.

14:50.391 --> 14:52.980
What the hell's all that,
ya reckon?

14:53.048 --> 14:53.748
Immigrants.

14:53.815 --> 14:59.150
Cramming their lowriders full of
free health care and... Snow.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.263
We should go to the gendarmerie!

15:07.331 --> 15:08.799
Yeah, if you weren't topless!

15:08.867 --> 15:11.902
Oh, and hadn't accused
me of molesting you!

15:11.970 --> 15:15.573
Are you going to throw that in
my face for the rest of my life?

15:15.641 --> 15:18.608
Yeah, all four minutes of it!

15:20.414 --> 15:21.514
Idiota!

15:21.581 --> 15:23.049
The girl is worth millions!

15:23.117 --> 15:25.609
Be careful where you are shooting!

15:27.322 --> 15:29.611
Ooh, Pink Floyd show!

15:31.141 --> 15:31.993
Oh.

15:32.061 --> 15:36.865
Man, I'm gonna be in trouble...
Trouble dukes.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.167
Where are we going?

15:38.234 --> 15:38.935
The forest!

15:39.003 --> 15:41.404
They'll have to split up in there,
then we can take 'em out one

15:41.472 --> 15:42.672
or two at a time!

15:42.740 --> 15:43.908
You want to fight them?

15:43.975 --> 15:44.942
Are you insane?

15:45.010 --> 15:47.645
No, just incredibly pissed off!

15:47.713 --> 15:50.601
You can't believe what this
is doing to my stitches!

15:52.518 --> 15:54.454
Okay, I need you to do
exactly what I tell you

15:54.521 --> 15:58.007
when I tell you, without...
We should just go to the what?

17:05.771 --> 17:08.809
Because I came in second, smartass!

17:08.876 --> 17:09.943
Out of how many?

17:10.011 --> 17:10.577
Two?

17:10.645 --> 17:12.180
Will ya just shut up and drive?

17:12.247 --> 17:12.980
How do I do it?

17:13.048 --> 17:13.681
Right hand!

17:13.749 --> 17:14.781
Take the throttle!

17:14.849 --> 17:16.585
Like this?

17:16.653 --> 17:17.953
No, ya gotta twist it!

17:18.021 --> 17:19.488
I am twisting it!

17:19.556 --> 17:22.358
No, you gotta...
Hang on a second!

17:22.425 --> 17:24.673
You gotta twist it like this.

17:27.098 --> 17:28.833
You've gotta go faster, Anka!

17:28.900 --> 17:29.600
Faster?

17:29.668 --> 17:31.268
I'm freezing to death already!

17:31.336 --> 17:34.339
You shoulda thought of that before
you took your stupid clothes off!

17:34.407 --> 17:35.807
Seriously, would you go?

17:35.875 --> 17:37.577
I'm doing it like you said.

17:37.644 --> 17:41.647
Grip it as hard as you can, and
twist the absolute shit out of it!

17:41.715 --> 17:43.283
Oh, I get it!

17:43.351 --> 17:45.853
Just like men love
it on their Wilhelm!

17:45.920 --> 17:48.323
No we don't...
Oh, my God!

17:48.390 --> 17:50.492
You've never even seen a Wilhelm!

17:50.559 --> 17:52.594
Wh-? I have seen dozens!

17:52.662 --> 17:53.996
Scores even!

17:54.064 --> 17:55.431
You are such a liar!

17:55.499 --> 17:58.535
I bet you've never even
gotten to second base!

17:58.603 --> 18:01.438
I... Well, so maybe not!
So what?

18:01.506 --> 18:02.772
What do you mean so what?

18:02.840 --> 18:05.776
Why do you behave like...
No one cares how I behave!

18:05.844 --> 18:10.315
Mama is gone, papa is always at work, so
I just rot away at that boarding school!

18:10.383 --> 18:13.987
Yeah, and then I bet you get...
Sent off to camp all summer!

18:14.054 --> 18:16.289
Riding camp, skiing camp...!

18:16.357 --> 18:17.323
Lacrosse camp...!

18:17.391 --> 18:19.426
It's like he doesn't want me around!

18:19.494 --> 18:23.330
Yeah, so you misbehave because...
You just want a little attention!

18:23.398 --> 18:26.701
And it's so hard to make friends!

18:26.769 --> 18:29.005
Because you're insecure,
so you overcompensate,

18:29.072 --> 18:34.344
and come across as...
A snob, or arrogant, yeah, no I get it!

18:34.412 --> 18:36.914
You know Archer, I think
you and I are a lot alike

18:36.981 --> 18:41.219
I don't do that!

18:41.287 --> 18:42.954
Okay, I think that's all of em!

18:43.022 --> 18:48.494
Which is good, because I'm out of ammo...
And we're out of gas.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.563
Fantastic.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.264
Guess we'll have to hike back.

18:51.332 --> 18:53.533
Oh my God! You must be freezing.

18:53.601 --> 18:55.303
Hey relax, you're gonna be okay.

18:55.370 --> 18:58.272
We'll get you back to the hotel and...
All the wind from the

18:58.340 --> 19:01.410
driving, Archer, my hands
are really burning!

19:01.477 --> 19:03.779
Ooh, that's first-degree frostbite.

19:03.846 --> 19:05.715
Too bad you don't have big,
mitteny gloves, like me.

19:05.783 --> 19:07.283
I can't feel a thing in these.

19:07.351 --> 19:09.953
And it's like my breasts are on fire!

19:10.021 --> 19:12.790
I, um, just maybe put
your hands on them.

19:12.857 --> 19:15.160
My hands are like ice!

19:15.227 --> 19:17.141
But yours are...
No!

19:17.261 --> 19:19.434
- Please...
- No, we can make it back in like...

19:19.554 --> 19:21.615
- half hour tops.
- I can't wait that long.

19:21.735 --> 19:25.204
Please, with such big, mitteny
gloves, it won't even count!

19:25.272 --> 19:28.809
Nooope!
But I could get nerve damage!

19:28.876 --> 19:30.377
That's actually a possibility.

19:30.445 --> 19:31.346
Please, Archer!

19:31.413 --> 19:34.130
Just for one minute!
Um...

19:38.321 --> 19:41.191
Literally one minute, and
only because this is a

19:41.258 --> 19:43.660
medical emergency.

19:43.728 --> 19:45.695
Ahh... that feels nice.

19:45.763 --> 19:49.667
No it doesn't, don't enjoy this,
this is a medical proced... Oww!

19:49.735 --> 19:50.401
What's wrong?

19:50.469 --> 19:53.705
Nothing, just um...
My stitches.

19:53.773 --> 19:54.873
Oh yeah?

19:54.907 --> 19:56.743
Gettin' a little
"local swelling?"

19:59.113 --> 20:00.647
Right.

20:00.714 --> 20:06.420
I can't believe I let this happen...
It was those damn green Russians.

20:06.488 --> 20:09.624
Yeah, they pack a wallop...
And if you ever breathe

20:09.692 --> 20:11.760
a word of this, I will
gut you like a carp.

20:11.827 --> 20:14.296
Hey, what happens in Gstaad...

20:14.364 --> 20:16.532
Stays in Gstaad.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.503
Now who's ready for a shower?

20:19.570 --> 20:21.085
This gal!
