to try lying down?

01:19.713 --> 01:22.850
Because I am ready, Shaun.
I am very ready.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.285

01:26.019 --> 01:29.190
Six hundred thread count,

02:06.994 --> 02:08.562
I'm sorry.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.880
You didn't return
my calls this weekend.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.149
After a ride
up Skyline Boulevard,

02:29.183 --> 02:33.254
60 minutes of Muay Thai
and a 15-year reserve Scotch,

02:34.455 --> 02:36.089
I had a moment
of clarity.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.493
What you said about
my objectivity
in the Fields case

02:39.527 --> 02:41.262
wasn't about me.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.330
You were in pain.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.267
I was taking
responsibility.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.302
And asking you
to take your share.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.338
It was a good
surgical plan.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.945
You need to accept that,
despite being
a gifted surgeon,

02:58.446 --> 03:01.014
you are fallible.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.317
I think I should run
my procedures by Glassman

03:03.351 --> 03:04.452
from now on.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.389
Audrey, we need some
checks and balances.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.360
I am checked
and balanced.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.834
And I'm the chief
of this department.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.306
You will continue
to run your medical
decisions past me.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.322
DR. ANDREWS: Browne,
you're with Melendez today.

03:41.355 --> 03:44.258
Murphy and Park,
meet me in the ER
observation unit in 20.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.694
I thought I was
on ER consults
with Park today.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.529
If I'm being bumped because
I took off the other day,

03:48.562 --> 03:51.031
Dr. Browne was every bit...
First lead surgery.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.569
Thank you.
Scheduled for tomorrow.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.605
Study the images
and prep your patient.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.809
Yes. (CHUCKLES)
I rock. I rock.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.711
The surgery gods know it.
I know it.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.046
And apparently, so do
es Andrews.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.417
Boasting doesn't have
the same impact when
you're picked last.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.252
He was obviously
waiting for the right case
to come along.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.287
No.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.290
You're kidding me.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.993
This is much better
than my first surgery.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.563
Damn right.
A med student
could do an appy.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.566
The carotid endarterectomy
takes serious finesse.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.934
Fair to say it's really
a fifth-year procedure,

04:26.967 --> 04:29.737
but I don't have time
to sit around
debating semantics.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.807
I have the Holy Grail
of resident surgeries
to prep for.

04:38.078 --> 04:41.715
The tumor was found
on my left lung
at my medical fitness exam.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.051
Tricky spot.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.353
Curable,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.888
but tough to remove
without taking
the entire lung.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.691
That's what they said.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.159
And you didn't
like that answer.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.595
I need my lung.

the chest pain start?
Around 9:00 this morning.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.586
I'm gonna look at your heart.
This gel may be a little cold.

05:18.619 --> 05:22.055
You see a cardiologist.
Did you use the nitro
he prescribed?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.992
It usually relieves
the angina,
but not this time.

05:28.028 --> 05:32.933
Are you the same
Rosalind Elion who
just published a study

05:32.966 --> 05:35.436
on IDH2 inhibitors
in myeloid leukemia

05:35.469 --> 05:37.304
in the Journal
of Pediatric Oncology?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.639
Yeah.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.807
SHAUN: Wow.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.208
You're famous.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.946
I used an IDH2
on a kid with AML.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.648
He's doing great.
Oh.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.850

has revolutionized
leukemia treatment.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.619
It's an honor to meet you.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.253
That's kind of you to say.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.656
Noticing anteroapical wall
motion abnormalities.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.425

Yes.

having a heart attack.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.129
Contact her family,
then meet us in surgery.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.831
She needs a triple bypass.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.172

06:12.540 --> 06:13.774

06:25.018 --> 06:27.254
You never wanted
to be an astronaut
when you were a kid?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.957
Had enough challenges
here on Earth.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.191
Did you?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.360
I was a Trekker.

There's our tumor.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.236
It's embedded
in the hilum.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.406
NASA doctor was right.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.341
We'd have to take
the entire lung
to get it out.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.910
Not necessarily.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.712
The tumor's growing
into the upper lobe.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.847
If we can remove it
from the main bronchus,

06:53.881 --> 06:55.048
we can get a clean margin.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.950
The rest of the lung can stay.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.554
No go.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.222
You'd have 80% of...

07:02.255 --> 07:04.357
If treatment reduces
my lung volume at all,

07:04.391 --> 07:05.659
I'll be unfit
for space travel.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.227
The mass is too deep.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.997
Major blood vessels,
your airway, esophagus

07:10.030 --> 07:11.665
and heart are right there.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.067
The next opinion you get
will be the same.

the internal mammary
to the LAD.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.603

DR. PARK: I tracked
down her sister
in Santa Cruz,

08:24.705 --> 08:26.807
she hasn't seen Rosalind
in years either.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.341
That's a lot of legwork
for a surgeon.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.509

available?

08:29.543 --> 08:32.245
SHAUN: It's good that you
didn't find anyone.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.949
Family members are the least
qualified people in the room

08:35.983 --> 08:37.217
to make medical decisions.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.453
Judging by the state
of her myocardium,

08:40.487 --> 08:41.655
there's only one
choice anyway.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.892
She needs a new heart.

08:54.635 --> 08:58.138
I think it's possible
to spare her upper lobe
using a surgical robot.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.173
Wren Braxton
came to see me.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.942
You're her second opinion?

09:01.975 --> 09:04.377
Or fourth
or whatever she's up to?

09:04.411 --> 09:07.280
I'm surprised
you didn't offer
the robotic option.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.317
It's the type of surgery
I usually send your way.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.319
I didn't offer it
because with the robot,

09:12.352 --> 09:13.987
if I'd nicked
her pulmonary artery,

09:14.021 --> 09:15.555
she'd likely bleed out
before I get a chance

09:15.589 --> 09:16.990
to open her up
to control it.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.659
She's just gonna keep looking
until someone gives her

09:18.692 --> 09:21.228
the answer she wants.
And then what?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.196
What do you think
her odds of survival are

09:23.230 --> 09:25.165
if some hack
tries to cut the tumor out

09:25.198 --> 09:26.834
leaving the lungs intact?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.836
Roughly zero.
I agree.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.570
And with you,
with the robot?

09:31.271 --> 09:32.272
Still lousy.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.242
You can do this.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.477
You're overestimating
the risk and I know why.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.647
And you're doing exactly
what you did last time.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.649
Assuming that
I can do anything.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.550
So everyone else is biased
except for you.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.019
The one who just had
a patient die on him.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.588
If it's had any effect,

09:48.622 --> 09:50.257
it's to make my judgement
more acute.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.425
I won't risk
having Wren leave here

09:52.459 --> 09:54.127
the same way
that Patty Fields did.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.866
People risk things to make
their dreams come true.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.302
If you don't want
to help her,
I'll do it myself.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.545
DR. PARK: The intra-aortic
balloon pump

10:12.579 --> 10:15.248
will support your heart
until we find a donor.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.584
And when might that be?

10:17.617 --> 10:21.188
SHAUN: A heart is the
most difficult organ
to procure.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.791
But since yours
is so badly damaged,

10:23.824 --> 10:25.625
you are very high
on the list.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.698
I suppose that's
a good thing?
Not really.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.499
We're doing
everything we can.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.434
Thank you.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.869
DR. PARK: Is there anyone
you want us to call?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.004
Yes.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.741
My lab assistant.

10:42.109 --> 10:47.114
The next few days
are crucial to my
monoclonal antibody study.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.783
Hannah needs to stay with
the cultures around the clock.

10:53.586 --> 10:58.959
I don't want
five years of work
to go to waste.

10:58.992 --> 11:03.196
Can I ask why you listed
your ex-husband
as your medical proxy?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.633
I had to name someone.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.303
Leo is the only person
I ever discussed
my medical wishes with.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.306
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do

11:13.340 --> 11:15.709
which, as you've indicated,

11:15.743 --> 11:18.211
I may not have
a lot of time to do it.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.297
How are you, Shaun?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.869
These are STAT
cardiac labs.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.970
I have to go.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.072
I hope you're
not embarrassed
about last night.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.142
I want to have sex
with you.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.213
That's nice.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.148
I think about it
very often.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.120
Even when
I'm supposed to focus
on more pressing matters.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.521
Like, 15 minutes ago,

12:01.554 --> 12:03.656
when I was filling out
that lab requisition,

12:03.690 --> 12:06.026
I almost forgot
to add a BNP.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.395
That's good.
No, it's not.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.363
We need a BNP
to monitor

12:10.397 --> 12:12.833
her cardiac function
on the balloon pump.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.567
I've been thinking
about you, too.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.004
Sometimes when
I shouldn't.
That's bad.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.105
Not really.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.641
I've been doing
some research.

12:21.674 --> 12:26.379
I came across this therapy
psychologists use
to treat phobias.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.516
And apparently,
it works in people
with autism, too.

12:30.717 --> 12:34.221
If you're game,
we could try tonight.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.957
I'm game.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.333
DR. REZNICK: I need
a different first surgery.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.634
Is there a problem
with your patient?

12:47.667 --> 12:50.703
The plaque dissection
is too advanced
for a third-year resident.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.346
I was nervous as hell
for my first surgery.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.348
And it was only
a tonsillectomy.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.417
I could take out a pair
of tonsils blindfolded,
it's not nerves.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
This is more like
a fifth-year procedure.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.188
You're setting me up
to fail.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.957
This is why
I picked you.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.293
You come to me scared
and you couch it
in arrogance.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.097
It's rare that a resident
has what you have.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.133
The aggressiveness,
the work ethic
and talent

13:20.167 --> 13:21.401
to be a leader.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.904
I'm not setting
you up to fail,

13:23.937 --> 13:25.772
I'm setting you up
to shine.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.776
Or am I wrong
about you?

13:31.945 --> 13:33.246
No, sir. (CHUCKLES)

13:44.925 --> 13:46.359
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

13:49.796 --> 13:53.166
I want you to do my surgery.
The one Dr. Lim suggested.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.971
It was Dr. Lim's idea.
She's an excellent surgeon.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.440
And my superior.
And you think
I'm an idiot.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.977
I am afraid
of this surgery.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.380
And I'm afraid
of going to the moon.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.816
But it's not
about the moon,
it's about the fear.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.218
It's about
getting beyond that.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.686
That's how great
things happen.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.423
How they've
always happened.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.891
Because someone
took a chance.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.660
From what
I read about you,

14:20.693 --> 14:24.364
you're exactly the
kind of person
I need in my corner.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.467
Exactly the kind of person
I would have thought
would understand.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.905
Fear is also
what keeps us alive.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.476
What do you think
the odds are

14:36.509 --> 14:37.577
of you not coming back
from the moon?

14:39.046 --> 14:42.149
The reason it's heroic,
the reason it's exciting

14:42.182 --> 14:44.451
is because you don't know
what to expect.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.853
You can't
anticipate everything.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.991
One, two, maybe 5%.

14:51.024 --> 14:55.195
60%. This surgery,
if I were doing it.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.598
There is a 60% chance
that you die on the table.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.805
It's called
exposure therapy.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.708
We'll lie down on the bed,
side-by-side, fully clothed

15:08.741 --> 15:11.511
and not touching
for 15 seconds.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.813
When this timer goes off,
you'll go into the other room

15:13.846 --> 15:15.482
for a three-minute break.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.250
And then we'll go again
for 20 seconds.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.488
Over time,
we will progress
to longer intervals

15:21.521 --> 15:23.856
and start to lie
closer together.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.627
This seems
like a good approach.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.730
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

15:30.763 --> 15:32.032
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:38.471 --> 15:39.973
Whenever you're ready.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.614
(SHAUN BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:27.587 --> 16:29.822
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:37.430 --> 16:39.799
Are you okay?
What are you feeling?

16:39.832 --> 16:42.102
(STAMMERING)
I don't know!

16:42.135 --> 16:46.339
I don't know.
I don't know
why it didn't work.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.774
It's okay, Shaun.
We'll try again.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.476
No, no.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
No, no, I can't.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.679
We'll try for less time.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.514
I can't do this!

17:00.587 --> 17:01.721
Go.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.024
What?
Go.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.226
Get out of here.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.230
We can watch the end...

17:10.263 --> 17:13.800
I got the sheets,
the pillow,
the dim lightbulb,

17:13.833 --> 17:15.902
I read 18 psych journals.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.838
And you give up
after eight seconds?

17:22.075 --> 17:24.377
You're right,
this isn't going to work.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.153
Go home.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.338
How are things
with Carly?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.273
I lasted eight seconds.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.244
She kicked me
out of her house.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.882
First time is difficult.
I'm sure she didn't...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.851
We tried timed
exposure therapy

18:04.884 --> 18:06.819
to get physically closer,
but I...

18:07.854 --> 18:09.088
Couldn't do it.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.857
(CHUCKLES)

18:10.890 --> 18:12.292
So try something else.

18:14.461 --> 18:18.331
When I lie close to her,
I feel diaphoretic.

18:18.365 --> 18:22.769
My heart rate is elevated
and mouth gets dry.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.372
I don't know
how to not feel that way.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.840
You want this, Shaun?

18:28.641 --> 18:29.909
Yes.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.245
Very much.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.880
Then rely
on your strengths.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.548
Treat it like
a surgical problem.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.417
Do your research.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.686
Carly came up
with a solution,
it didn't work.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.421
But that doesn't mean
the next one won't.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.392
Give me some good news.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.926
I had a potential donor
in San Diego,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.461
but the heart
was just too damaged.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.263
I'm at the GE
junction now.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.136
Now she has complete
right-sided failure, too.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.373
It's time to discuss
a DNR.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.575
She's got one day left
in this world.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.277
Let's keep her comfortable.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.286
60%? That number
is grossly exaggerated.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.054
I spent an hour
convincing my patient

19:15.087 --> 19:16.155
I'm not trying
to kill her.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.925
She came to me,
I gave her
my surgical opinion.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.593
I could fire you
for this.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.229
Because I contradicted
your opinion

19:22.262 --> 19:23.796
after you contradicted
my opinion?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.599
I gave her an option
you were too afraid
to present.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.935
No, you proposed
a potentially deadly surgery

19:28.968 --> 19:31.504
to a woman who is desperate
for any option,
no matter how crazy.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.506
You don't have
the authority.
Authority?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.107
I thought we were talking
about the patient.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.809
It was unprofessional,
disrespectful.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.011
If anyone showed
a lack of respect...

19:39.045 --> 19:41.381
Doctors, my office.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.891
I wouldn't want
to be kept alive
on life support.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.696
Not if there was
no hope for recovery.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.331
There wouldn't be.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.000
As your heart failure
worsens,

20:01.033 --> 20:04.304
you may get short of breath
from fluid buildup.

20:04.337 --> 20:08.007
We can use diuretics
and vasodilators
to help control that.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.109
I recommend both of those.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.844
Of course, yes.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.513
If that doesn't help,

20:13.546 --> 20:17.183
we could insert a catheter
in your chest
to drain the fluid.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.818
The procedure does risk
a lung puncture

20:18.851 --> 20:21.120
which would worsen
your symptoms.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.023
You should give us
every option to keep you
breathing easy.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.460
And we'll be on call
all night to make sure

20:27.494 --> 20:28.661
you're as comfortable
as possible.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.697
Thank you.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.803
I went through this
with my mom when
she was dying of leukemia.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.538
I'm so sorry.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.907
Was it recent?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.276
I was 10.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.578
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

20:46.779 --> 20:48.915
I remember
feeling so helpless.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.752
You should reach out to Leo.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.187
(SCOFFS) It's too late.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.457
I don't believe that.

21:04.096 --> 21:08.267
There were things
between my wife and I

21:08.301 --> 21:10.570
that I thought
we could never get past.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.973
But last Christmas,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.044
we almost lost our son.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.247
And when I reached out,

21:21.914 --> 21:23.316
Mia was there.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.218
Leo

21:28.421 --> 21:29.722
always made me
feel pressured

21:29.756 --> 21:31.958
to choose between
my research and him.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.796
Eventually,
I realized he was right.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.968
So I chose to go
where I was needed
the most.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.405
To call him now would be

21:45.438 --> 21:47.774
hypocritical and...

21:48.741 --> 21:50.176
Unfair.

21:53.346 --> 21:56.483
It took a lot of time

21:56.516 --> 22:00.186
and dedication to push
our understanding of leukemia

22:00.219 --> 22:01.921
as far as you did.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.358
I'm glad I have treatment
options for my patients.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.428
You made a good choice.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.804
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.840
I assume that some of this
is professional,

22:20.873 --> 22:23.676
the other 90%
is personal.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.811
Am I right?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.579
It's a very
difficult case.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.781
We're both just
overly invested.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.384
Actually, I'd love for you
to weigh in on this one.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.121
Dr. Lim, are you confident
in the surgical plan?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.525
Good luck.
Thank you.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.892
You didn't even
look at the case.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.061
The pulmonary...

22:42.094 --> 22:44.363
Dr. Lim is my
Chief of Surgery.
I trust her judgement.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.033
I'm sorry things
got out of hand.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.300
It won't happen again.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.636
It better not happen again.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.572
If you two can't control
your interpersonal
squabblings,

22:52.605 --> 22:55.207
I'm gonna have to
lose one of you,
at least.

23:06.085 --> 23:09.188
We need an endoscopy suite
to fetch the spoon out
of this guy's stomach.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.057
Cool.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.692
How's the intimacy
research going?

23:12.725 --> 23:16.128
Dr. Elion has had
a very successful life

23:16.162 --> 23:19.065
without a relationship.
So can I.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.233
Success and happiness
aren't the same thing.

23:21.267 --> 23:24.704
You need to decide
what will make you
happy in the end.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.206
I don't know
if it's being
a great surgeon

23:27.239 --> 23:28.875
or being close to Carly.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.644
But I'm better at surgery
than I am with her.

23:31.678 --> 23:34.346
Dr. Elion is wrong,
you don't have to choose.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.982
I fly to Phoenix
every other weekend

23:36.015 --> 23:37.984
to spend time
with Mia and Kellan.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.686
Then you won't
be great at either.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.757
I think Dr. Elion
is afraid.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.261
I think it was never
about the journals

23:49.295 --> 23:51.397
and the lives
she could save.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.733
I think she's always
been afraid.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.336
Afraid she might lose Leo
just like she lost her mother.

23:57.369 --> 23:58.705
And you,

23:58.738 --> 24:02.709
you lost the person
you loved the most
when your brother died.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.077
Your elevated heart rate,
sweaty palms

24:05.111 --> 24:07.880
are not about
your sensory issues,
Shaun.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.582
It's what we all feel.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.651
Fear.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.224
Why would anyone
want to feel afraid?

24:21.293 --> 24:24.797
Because the thought
of ending up alone
is scarier.

24:31.938 --> 24:35.074
I don't think Dr. Elion
refuses to call Leo

24:35.107 --> 24:36.776
because it is hypocritical.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.346
I think she's afraid
he won't come.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.314
Can you handle
the spoon?
Yes.

24:42.348 --> 24:43.716
(INHALES DEEPLY)

24:43.750 --> 24:45.017
Okay. (SIGHS)

24:51.357 --> 24:53.425
Good morning,
Dr. Glassman.
Morning.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.596
Which shoulder
would you like to hurt
for the next 24 hours?

24:56.629 --> 24:58.364
I'm not here for a vaccine.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.567
Okay.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.603
Wrist and thumb joint pain.
I need cortisone shots.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.037
Surgery is in two hours.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.309
Can I ask you something?

25:10.342 --> 25:12.979
If a patient,
say, a violinist

25:13.012 --> 25:15.147
who concertize
three or four times a week

25:15.181 --> 25:17.116
were to come to you
with achy joints,

25:17.149 --> 25:18.785
would you give him
a cortisone shot

25:18.818 --> 25:20.186
or tell him to lay off
for a while?

25:21.453 --> 25:22.855
Better question.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.257
If he or she came to you
with achy joints

25:25.291 --> 25:28.194
and pretended
they needed
a vaccination,

25:28.227 --> 25:29.729
what would you do then?

25:32.464 --> 25:33.465
It's...

25:34.466 --> 25:37.369
It's because I wanted
you to know and no one else.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.982
I saw a rheumatologist
last month.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.720
I have rheumatoid arthritis.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.025
Wow.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.426
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.166
My...
My mom had it, too.

26:07.199 --> 26:10.202
It destroyed her wrist
and finger joints.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.743
DR. LIM:
Maybe I should leave
Saint Bonaventure.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.378
Berkeley's Chief
is retiring this year.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.713
I could apply
to replace him.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.049
We are entitled
to have differing
opinions.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.284
We can argue...
Apparently we can't.

26:29.822 --> 26:30.957
I love you.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.703
I want our relationship
to work.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.573
And I want to be Chief.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.542
If we can't find a way
to work together with me
as your boss,

26:51.711 --> 26:53.746
then something
has to change.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.952
Looks like
you caught it early.

26:59.986 --> 27:04.390
Without any noticeable
erosion of the joints.
That's good.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.858
What's your
DMARD dose?

27:05.892 --> 27:07.126
Twenty milligrams,

27:07.159 --> 27:09.428

just started it.

(SMACKS LIPS) Okay.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.470
You're gonna have
to postpone

27:18.504 --> 27:20.139
your first lead surgery
for awhile.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.741
See how you respond.

27:21.774 --> 27:24.043
I'd have to explain why
to Andrews and Lim.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.211
As you should.

27:25.244 --> 27:28.447
Cortisone shot
is just a temporary fix.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.117
Do you know what
the chances are
the DMARD can maintain

27:31.150 --> 27:35.587
the dexterity you need
to perform an operation
in the long run? 45%.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.623
It'll change the way
they see me.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.327
Yeah,
you have a condition,
a medical condition.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.628
They'll expect less
from me.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.064
They'll be looking
for me to fail.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.867
Th-That's why
I'm confiding in you
instead of them.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.503
You advocated for Shaun
when everybody else

27:51.537 --> 27:52.772
thought he couldn't be
a surgeon.

27:52.805 --> 27:55.808
I'm sorry, you're comparing
arthritis to autism?

27:55.842 --> 27:58.544
I'm comparing
people's assumptions,
people's prejudices.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.849
I'm asking for a chance
to prove myself.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.789
In the surgery today,
you're gonna have to create

28:09.822 --> 28:12.624
a plane as thin as paper

28:12.658 --> 28:15.527
between two delicate
layers of tissue

28:15.561 --> 28:17.964
without disrupting
the major blood flow
to the brain.

28:17.997 --> 28:21.968
If you miss by one-tenth,
one-tenth of a millimeter,

28:22.001 --> 28:25.905
the patient will suffer
permanent brain damage
or worse.

28:32.678 --> 28:36.715
Right now,
it's a matter of pain,
not function.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.685
You think I would put
a patient's life at risk?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.719
That's insulting.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.023
I'm sorry.

28:47.626 --> 28:50.930
Without the pain,
I can do this.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.900
You believed in Shaun.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.736
I need someone
to believe in me, too.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.543

She's dying.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.625
She wants to see you.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.996
Then why didn't she call me?
Why did she send you?

29:24.030 --> 29:25.564
She doesn't
know I'm here.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.970
Even when we were married,
I never topped her to-do list.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.704
DR. PARK: She wasn't
cheating on you.

29:32.738 --> 29:35.574
She wasn't doing anything
except saving lives.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.476
She deserves
to be cut
a little slack.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.179
Yeah.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.748
She was saving the whole
damn world. She's a saint.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.251
I made partner,
she wasn't there,
everybody understood.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.854
My mother died,
she wasn't there,
everybody understood.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.255
Well, I didn't.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.693
Look, maybe I was
a selfish jerk for wanting
my wife to be around

29:54.726 --> 29:56.595
but I did.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.764
She didn't send you.

in any way I can.

incision, 11:32.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.666
DR. PARK: How is she?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.035
She's really
short of breath.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.803
I gave her vasodilators
and diuretics,
but she's not settling.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.305
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

31:15.942 --> 31:18.344

She needs 40 milligrams
of furosemide.

You've got fluid
in your chest.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.790
This medication should help
ease your breathing.

31:31.823 --> 31:35.161
She should be improving,
but she's not.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.563
Maybe we should
insert a drain.

31:40.366 --> 31:43.835
Shaun, this isn't about
the fluid, she's scared.

31:43.869 --> 31:47.039
Rosalind, I know
this is frightening,

31:47.073 --> 31:48.540
but you are not alone.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.909

and I am not
going anywhere.
