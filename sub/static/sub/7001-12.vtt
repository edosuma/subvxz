01:13.530 --> 01:16.960
The important thing to remember
this holiday season is make it a safe one,

01:17.050 --> 01:19.399
Which brings us
to today's Tool Time tip. Lisa?

01:19.490 --> 01:21.319
Now, be careful with this, Tim.

01:21.409 --> 01:22.960
I will. Thank you, Lisa.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.960
This is a completely frayed wire.

01:25.050 --> 01:27.319
And you never want
to plug in a frayed wire.

01:27.409 --> 01:31.159
AI, do you suppose they call it "a frayed"
because it's scared of something?

01:31.250 --> 01:33.040
I really doubt it. Tim.

01:33.129 --> 01:35.319
Oh. I do too. AI.

01:35.849 --> 01:40.319
AI will now show us how
to safely tape up that wire. Be careful.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.000
Merry Christmas. AI.

01:43.089 --> 01:45.079
You know.
there's nothing more fun in the world

01:45.169 --> 01:48.869
than sitting around a beautifully
decorated Christmas tree in your home.

01:48.970 --> 01:52.040
grunting your favorite Christmas carols.

01:52.129 --> 01:54.319
That brings one to mind.

02:06.329 --> 02:08.520
Come on. AI, hit it.

02:11.970 --> 02:14.119
Everybody, come on.

02:17.369 --> 02:19.079
That's the spirit.

02:19.169 --> 02:21.079
You know, the only problem
I have with Christmas trees.

02:21.169 --> 02:23.079
you spend so much time
decorating the front of it.

02:23.169 --> 02:24.800
you never get to see the back of it.

02:24.889 --> 02:27.480
So I got this idea
from an old college turntable.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.399
Maybe we could motorize this thing.

02:29.490 --> 02:32.319
So I used a ten-amp.
heavy-duty synchronous motor.

02:32.409 --> 02:35.000
triple-reduction gears
and a four-to-one final drive…

02:35.089 --> 02:36.359
Well, excuse me. Tim.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.960
Are you sure you connected
the spur gear to the final drive.

02:39.050 --> 02:42.000
instead of the motor output shaft?

02:42.089 --> 02:46.159
AI. I'm insulted.
You know who you're talking to?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.599
Yes. I do. Tim.

02:52.889 --> 02:54.520
There's more than one way to do it. AI.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.680
- Lisa, plug it in for me.
- Sure thing. Tim.

02:56.770 --> 02:59.839
- Well, it's just that…
- AI, please?

03:02.290 --> 03:04.440
Well, son of a gun.

03:04.530 --> 03:09.520
When you know what you're doing.
folks, anything is possible.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.879
Incoming!

03:23.210 --> 03:26.559
Mom, can I have another piece of paper?

03:26.649 --> 03:31.280
Honey, that Christmas list
looks a little long. Let me see that.

03:31.889 --> 03:34.270
You know. I don't think
that Santa's going to be able

03:34.369 --> 03:39.599
to bring you everything on this list
cos that would make his sleigh too heavy.

03:41.649 --> 03:43.950
I'll cross off the heaviest things.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.190
OK.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.240
Cocker spaniel.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.000
Bye, floppy.

03:51.089 --> 03:53.680
You know. I think that you should pick out

03:53.770 --> 03:57.389
the thing that you really want
and put a star next to that.

03:57.490 --> 04:00.839
OK. The remote-control dinosaur.

04:00.930 --> 04:03.200
All right.

04:04.129 --> 04:08.319
Tim, there's like 12 boxes of decorations.
How many are you gonna bring up?

04:08.409 --> 04:10.839
- One more out of the basement.
- And that's it?

04:10.930 --> 04:14.200
One more out of the basement
and a couple out of my car.

04:14.290 --> 04:15.430
How many is a couple?

04:15.530 --> 04:16.668
Ten.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.399
- I know why you're doing this.
- I have the Christmas spirit.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.119
You just can't stand that Doc Johnson

04:23.210 --> 04:25.800
always wins that
Christmas decoration contest.

04:25.889 --> 04:28.559
You always think
I'm competing with Doc Johnson.

04:28.649 --> 04:34.829
Oh, it doesn't bother you that he's added
those extra three giant candles on his roof?

04:34.930 --> 04:40.520
There's four of 'em, and this little
dancing elf, but that doesn't bother me.

04:40.609 --> 04:45.470
Well, just don't set fire to the roof.
like you did last year.

04:45.569 --> 04:47.950
I didn't set fire.
It was an electrical short.

04:48.050 --> 04:51.359
I just don't want to have to
drive you to the emergency room again.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.559
Wait. Wait a minute.

04:53.649 --> 04:58.669
Except for last year, when was the last time
you drove me to the emergency room?

04:58.770 --> 05:00.800
The eighties.

05:00.889 --> 05:05.520
You mess up one decade
and you'll never let me forget it.

05:06.450 --> 05:07.720
Yeah, well.

05:07.809 --> 05:13.680
Why don't you just try taking a year off
and not compete with Dr Johnson?

05:13.770 --> 05:17.119
Some thanks I get for trying
to spread a little Christmas cheer.

05:17.210 --> 05:21.159
You're spreading around something.
but it ain't Christmas cheer.

05:21.250 --> 05:23.200
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, hey.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.589
How did the tryouts
for the Christmas pageant go?

05:25.690 --> 05:28.359
Terrible. I'm a shepherd again.

05:28.450 --> 05:32.480
Oh, well, honey, the shepherd is a very
important part of the Christmas story.

05:32.569 --> 05:37.559
- I don't have any lines.
- That's because you blew it, you stooge.

05:39.010 --> 05:41.280
He was trying out for one of the wise men.

05:41.369 --> 05:45.559
and he said they were
carrying gold and Frankenstein.

05:45.649 --> 05:48.559
So? You only play the stupid innkeeper.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.760
Stupid innkeeper? How many lines
does the stupid innkeeper have?

05:52.849 --> 05:54.720
One lousy line.

05:54.809 --> 05:57.319
"There's no room at the inn."

05:58.770 --> 05:59.879
Got an idea.

05:59.970 --> 06:02.720
Right after you say your line.
"There's no room at the inn", add this:

06:02.809 --> 06:05.369
"You should have called
our 1 -800 reservation hotline."

06:05.450 --> 06:09.230
Yeah, yeah. Ignore your father. Randy.
You're gonna be a wonderful innkeeper.

06:09.329 --> 06:13.399
Well. I wanted to play Joseph, but
they said there were too many lines for me.

06:13.490 --> 06:15.839
Too many lines?
You have a wonderful memory.

06:15.930 --> 06:19.119
- Who got the part?
- George Lonnigan.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.399
George Lonnigan?

06:21.490 --> 06:24.800
He couldn't remember the words
to "Happy Birthday" at your party.

06:24.889 --> 06:28.639
I know, but what can I say?
His dad built the set.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.200
Well, oh!

06:30.290 --> 06:34.960
That is just favoritism.
Tim, you should have built the set.

06:36.770 --> 06:40.760
Boy, is that the voice
of the Christmas spirit I hear?

06:40.849 --> 06:44.079
He forgot the words to "Happy Birthday".
Tim. Is that the Joseph you want?

06:44.169 --> 06:49.319
What's he gonna say?
"Meet my wife, the virgin, duh. Sheila"?

06:50.129 --> 06:52.359
Mom, we don't care if we're in that pageant.

06:52.450 --> 06:55.720
Yes, you do.
This family has the Christmas spirit.

06:55.809 --> 06:57.680
And when I'm finished
sewing your costumes.

06:57.770 --> 07:01.200
you're gonna be
the best-dressed Hebrews in Bethlehem.

07:01.530 --> 07:06.389
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Making out my list for Santa Claus.

07:06.490 --> 07:11.639
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad
aren't gonna buy you all this stuff.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.319
Why should they? Santa will make it.

07:16.129 --> 07:19.879
Mark, are you gonna be a dork
your whole life?

07:19.970 --> 07:22.240
I hope not.

07:22.889 --> 07:25.760
Randy, he's making a list for Santa Claus.

07:26.369 --> 07:28.829
Mark, you're too old
to believe in Santa Claus.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.520
Kids are gonna start to make fun of you.

07:31.609 --> 07:33.280
What are you talking about?

07:33.369 --> 07:38.040
I hate to break it to you.
but there is no Santa Claus.

07:39.369 --> 07:41.280
You're lying. Who drinks the milk

07:41.369 --> 07:44.159
and eats the chocolate-chip cookies
that I leave out for him?

07:44.250 --> 07:48.319
Oh. Dad. He loves chocolate-chip cookies.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.040
You guys are poopheads.

07:55.369 --> 07:58.040
OK, fine. Here's the truth.

07:59.050 --> 08:03.319
There used to be a Santa Claus.
but he died six years ago.

08:03.409 --> 08:07.109
Yep. You just missed out.

08:09.450 --> 08:11.599
Santa Claus isn't dead.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.359
Yes, he is.

08:13.450 --> 08:16.520
He had a terrible accident
with one of his reindeer.

08:16.609 --> 08:18.990
Blitzen fell on him.

08:20.569 --> 08:23.200
He's really dead?

08:23.290 --> 08:25.849
- Kicked the bucket.
- Bought the dirt farm.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.119
- Six feet under.
- Pushing up the daisies.

08:28.210 --> 08:30.399
- Deader than a doornail.
- Stiff as a board.

08:30.490 --> 08:32.720
- Cold as ice.
- Met his maker.

08:47.050 --> 08:52.680
Randy. Turn off the TV and come here.
I have some great stuff for your costume.

08:53.690 --> 08:56.559
- What now?
- Come here and see.

08:58.050 --> 09:01.240
This is your cape.

09:01.329 --> 09:03.480
- Just put this around you.
- Mom.

09:03.569 --> 09:06.480
This is gold. I'm just an innkeeper.

09:06.569 --> 09:07.599
Hey.

09:07.690 --> 09:10.879
You are a very successful innkeeper.

09:12.010 --> 09:18.000
Now, this is just great. That's gonna
really look good with the hat that I got you.

09:21.930 --> 09:23.520
Perfect.

09:26.530 --> 09:27.879
Hi. Jill.

09:27.970 --> 09:30.760
Hello. Ali Baba.

09:30.849 --> 09:33.639
- Dad.
- He's an innkeeper.

09:33.730 --> 09:39.359
Well, what inn are Mary and Joseph
staying at this year? Caesar's Palace?

09:39.450 --> 09:41.079
You can go now.

09:41.169 --> 09:43.240
You look terrific.

09:43.329 --> 09:46.240
Now. let me hear you say your line.

09:46.329 --> 09:48.079
There's no room at the inn.

09:48.169 --> 09:51.599
Honey. I think you need to say it
with a little more feeling.

09:51.690 --> 09:54.069
There's no room at the inn.

09:59.129 --> 10:01.319
Hi. Wilson.
Do you have that old diesel generator?

10:01.409 --> 10:03.559
I'm gonna light up
this revolving Santa on my roof.

10:03.649 --> 10:05.950
I'm sorry. I loaned that to the good doctor.

10:06.050 --> 10:08.760
- What?
- Oh, he did ask for it first.

10:08.849 --> 10:11.680
I could give you some tinsel
and a nine-volt battery.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.760
That's pretty funny. Wilson.

10:13.849 --> 10:18.000
Tim. I sense some competition
between you and the good doctor.

10:18.089 --> 10:20.720
No. I'm just decorating my house.

10:20.809 --> 10:23.109
I notice you don't decorate
your house at Christmas, though.

10:23.210 --> 10:25.240
Well, actually. Tim. I decorate within.

10:25.329 --> 10:29.999
I have a tree in my heart.
a wreath in my mind, and a star in my soul.

10:30.089 --> 10:32.519
And you plug it in your bellybutton.

10:33.450 --> 10:34.640
Dad. Dad.

10:34.729 --> 10:37.439
Dr Johnson just put up
mo huge spotlights.

10:37.530 --> 10:39.120
- What?
- Joyeux Noël. Tim.

10:39.209 --> 10:40.350
And to you too, Wilson.

10:40.450 --> 10:44.280
I didn't even see any of that stuff.
I just looked over there.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.800
Where'd you see…

10:45.890 --> 10:47.680
Those aren't spotlights.

10:47.769 --> 10:51.280
Those are 7.000-watt
Xenon Super Troupers.

10:51.370 --> 10:53.479
That guy is sick.

10:53.569 --> 10:58.120
It's you and me. Santa.
against the doctor. Come on, buddy.

11:07.010 --> 11:09.310
- This is cool. Dad.
- Thanks.

11:11.010 --> 11:14.039
All right.
We're about ready to watch the trial run

11:14.129 --> 11:17.749
of Santa taking his journey
from the sled over to the chimney.

11:17.850 --> 11:20.200
I put him on a modified turntable.

11:20.289 --> 11:21.879
And remember…

11:21.970 --> 11:25.669
always attach
the spur gear to the final drive.

11:30.370 --> 11:32.080
That's awesome. Dad.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.729
I'm gonna get my tools and come in.

11:35.689 --> 11:38.439
Boy, it is awful slippery up here.

11:51.129 --> 11:53.399
Dad, the hammer's frozen to your tongue.

11:53.490 --> 11:56.080
I know it is.

11:57.410 --> 11:59.600
Help! Help!

12:06.450 --> 12:08.479
Thank you for coming so fast. Bob.

12:08.569 --> 12:10.999
No problem. Mrs Taylor. That's our job.

12:11.089 --> 12:12.839
Does that feel better now. Mr Taylor?

12:16.330 --> 12:17.760
You know. Mr Taylor.

12:17.850 --> 12:22.439
it kind of surprised me when I saw that
hammer hanging out of your mouth there.

12:22.530 --> 12:24.600
I didn't mean to laugh.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.120
That's all right.

12:29.209 --> 12:32.039
You know. Mr Taylor.
we watch your show all the time.

12:32.129 --> 12:34.560
- I think it's really great.
- Thanks very much.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.070
Why didn't you have AI here to help you?

12:37.159 --> 12:41.389
Yeah. I mean, he's really good
on the show. I love that guy.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.750
Oh, we all love that guy.

12:44.360 --> 12:49.870
Well, we're out of here. Guess
we'll probably see you next Christmas.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.110
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you. Thanks a lot.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.629
- Here, have some Christmas cookies.
- Oh, well, thank you. Mrs Taylor.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.029
- Thanks for coming.
- Merry Christmas.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.190
- So long.
- Merry Christmas. Bye-bye.

13:00.279 --> 13:05.139
- Better get that crowd dispersed.
- All right, folks, break it up. Show's over.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.429
We saved his tongue.

13:10.399 --> 13:15.259
Promise me you will stop this
before you hurt yourself again.

13:15.360 --> 13:19.710
Through. They're judging the competition
in mo hours. What more can I do?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.830
You're through
competing with Doc Johnson?

13:21.919 --> 13:23.750
I'm through.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.220
All right.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.789
Hello. Detroit Edison? Yeah.

13:44.879 --> 13:48.830
This is Dr Johnson here
at 562 Glenview Road.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.909
Yeah, my wife and I
are heading out to dinner.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.669
Could you shut the power off
in exactly mo hours?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.429
What?

13:59.519 --> 14:01.980
Oh, hi. Eddie.

14:03.279 --> 14:05.470
I tried this last year, huh?

14:08.240 --> 14:10.470
Didn't work then, either, did it?

14:10.559 --> 14:12.940
Yes, the firemen got me down.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.389
Oh, my tongue's fine. Ed.
Thanks for asking.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.309
And a merry Christmas to you. See you.

14:20.399 --> 14:22.350
Oh, hi, honey.

14:22.440 --> 14:28.590
You were going to turn the power off in the
house of a 76-year-old retired proctologist?

14:30.399 --> 14:32.960
If I could have gotten away with it, yes.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.509
You're pathetic.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.230
- I'm pathetic?
- Yes.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.110
How about the church pageant, with you?

14:38.200 --> 14:41.590
Hey. I'm just trying
to build up their self-esteem.

14:41.679 --> 14:45.629
Making 'em go out
dressed like the Gabor sisters?

14:46.879 --> 14:48.470
Mom. Dad?

14:48.559 --> 14:52.389
Brad and Randy said
Santa died six years ago.

14:53.399 --> 14:55.750
They told you that he was dead?

14:55.840 --> 15:00.909
Well, that was a little extreme, son.
I think he's old, but he's not dead.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.629
So Santa's alive?

15:04.559 --> 15:07.350
Yeah. You sat on his lap at the mall.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.470
But there are a lot of malls.
How can he be at every one?

15:11.559 --> 15:13.990
He's real fast for a fat guy.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.950
Actually, honey. I think that those guys
at the mall are Santa's helpers, you know.

15:22.039 --> 15:24.269
- The way that AI is Daddy's helper.
- Right.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.309
- So they do all the work.
- Yeah.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.470
They assist Santa.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.990
like AI assists me.

15:39.799 --> 15:41.950
Oh, that makes sense.

15:42.039 --> 15:43.389
See?

15:43.480 --> 15:49.029
Santa's got to be alive, cos
you and Dad wouldn't lie to me. Thanks.

15:52.559 --> 15:55.120
We just lied to him.

15:55.519 --> 16:01.029
He is our last baby. I wanted him
to have one more magical Christmas.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.029
I hope we are doing the right thing.

16:05.519 --> 16:08.269
Fe/iz Navidad, seńorTim.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.389
fe/iz Ańo N4evo to you. Mr Wilson.

16:12.879 --> 16:16.419
Beautiful night tonight.
feels like more snow.

16:16.519 --> 16:19.389
I hope not. I gotta finish
putting those decorations on the roof.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.110
I figured Jill might have
put the kibosh on those decorations

16:22.200 --> 16:24.990
after that little mishap with your tongue.

16:25.080 --> 16:25.990
Hey.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.710
It's my house, my roof, my decorations.
I do what I want around here. Wilson.

16:30.799 --> 16:34.549
- What time did Jill leave. Tim?
- About ten minutes ago.

16:36.879 --> 16:38.470
Can I ask you something?

16:38.559 --> 16:40.750
Jingle my bell, neighbor.

16:40.840 --> 16:45.629
Mark is starting to ask us
questions about Santa Claus.

16:46.519 --> 16:50.059
Well, should we tell him
that he doesn't exist?

16:50.159 --> 16:52.870
Well, who says he doesn't exist. Tim?

16:52.960 --> 16:55.710
I believe it was Hamlet
who put it best when he said:

16:55.799 --> 16:58.509
"There are more things
in heaven and earth, good neighbor,

16:58.600 --> 17:01.110
than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

17:01.200 --> 17:03.830
But Brad and Randy
already said he was dead.

17:03.919 --> 17:07.670
Technically, that's true.
He died in the year 342.

17:07.759 --> 17:10.220
Well, then, who's at the mall?

17:10.319 --> 17:13.910
Oh, no, Tim. I'm talking
about the original Santa Claus.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.589
St Nicholas.
the bishop of Myra in Asia Minor.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.589
He used to go around
to the houses of the poor people,

17:19.680 --> 17:23.299
on his donkey, with bags of gold,
and drop them down the chimney.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.348
Why would he drop donkeys
down the chimney?

17:26.440 --> 17:29.430
I'm talking about the bags of gold, Tim.

17:29.519 --> 17:31.819
Hopefully he can put
a remote-controlled dinosaur

17:31.920 --> 17:35.950
down my chimney for Mark,
because the stores are sold out of them.

17:36.039 --> 17:40.029
Well, maybe Santa Claus
might bring it to him.

17:40.119 --> 17:42.420
I thought you said Santa was dead.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.109
Ah, but Tim, the spirit of Santa lives on.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.069
It lives in all of us.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.910
Well, I must get back
to my chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.710
You know, that reminds me of a song.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.430
On the first day of Christmas,
my true love sent to me

17:58.519 --> 18:00.670
A partridge in a pear tree

18:00.759 --> 18:02.710
On the second day of Christmas…

18:02.799 --> 18:04.789
- You blew it.
- I did not.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.029
- You did too.
- OK, guys, enough, enough.

18:08.119 --> 18:11.869
I think I got a little carried away
making that costume and coaching him.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.910
- What happened, honey?
- Oh, well.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.750
Randy's no longer playing the innkeeper
cos he added some lines.

18:17.839 --> 18:23.549
Yeah. He doubled the price of the room
and asked the wise men for ID.

18:27.079 --> 18:29.789
They made me a sheep.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.349
Hey, guys, no TV.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.549
That's part of your punishment
for your little trick about Santa Claus.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.069
Oh, man.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.349
Well, who wants hot chocolate?

18:38.440 --> 18:40.029
- Me. 
- Me.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.309
Mom. Dad? I have a question.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.750
Yes, sweetie?

18:43.839 --> 18:48.630
How does Santa get gifts
for everyone in the world in one bag?

18:48.720 --> 18:51.279
Jill?

18:51.759 --> 18:54.109
Well, honey, he folds them.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.420
- folds them?
- Yeah, he folds them.

18:57.519 --> 19:01.630
Then he has Mrs Claus sit on the bag
so he can tie it shut.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.670
That doesn't sound right. How do you
fold goldfish? How do you fold a pony?

19:05.759 --> 19:07.309
- Well, there's a quarter horse.
- Tim.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.779
You put it in…

19:11.400 --> 19:13.960
Honey. I think that
we need to talk to you about Santa.

19:14.039 --> 19:16.500
Is he dead again?

19:17.880 --> 19:23.309
Mark, as you grow up, you learn a whole
bunch of things along the way. OK?

19:23.400 --> 19:26.190
The Easter Bunny. Santa Claus…

19:27.400 --> 19:28.619
I'll get it.

19:28.720 --> 19:33.309
You see, it's the spirit of Santa Claus
that really matters.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.670
- Whether he existed or not…
- Merry Christmas!

19:36.759 --> 19:41.029
- Wilson, what are you doing here?
- The name is Santa.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.630
Hello there. Mark.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.109
Are you the real Santa?

19:48.200 --> 19:50.230
The one and only.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.990
Mom, that's Wilson.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.190
Santa, would you like some hot chocolate?

19:57.279 --> 20:00.980
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Mrs Claus told me to cut back.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.349
Well, it still looks like
you're packing it in there.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.910
Maybe swallowed a few
too many yams there at Thanksgiving.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.630
This is so bogus.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.829
Well, even though
it's not quite Christmas yet.

20:11.920 --> 20:16.589
I thought my little buddy Mark needed
an extra helping of Christmas spirit.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.509
- Should I go get my list?
- No, there's no need to. Mark.

20:21.039 --> 20:23.339
In your heart…

20:23.440 --> 20:25.710
what I think you really want…

20:25.799 --> 20:30.390
is a remote-controlled dinosaur.

20:32.079 --> 20:34.789
Great! It's not even folded.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.240
Thank you, Santa.

20:41.359 --> 20:43.470
- And Mark, don't forget this.
- What's this?

20:43.559 --> 20:48.470
Well, unlike the toy companies,
with Santa, batteries are included.

20:48.559 --> 20:50.859
Anything for us, Santa?

20:50.960 --> 20:54.150
Well, even though
you boys no longer believe in me.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.670
Santa brought you a gift anyway.

20:57.599 --> 21:01.069
Brad, I've got you a rubber band.

21:05.519 --> 21:08.349
And Randy, here's a button.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.509
Well, Santa, what'd you bring us?

21:13.599 --> 21:16.059
Well, with the hustle
and bustle of Christmas.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.779
sometimes we get involved
in decorating and pageants.

21:19.880 --> 21:24.670
and we often forget that the true meaning
of Christmas is about coming together.

21:24.759 --> 21:26.150
And sharing.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.269
And that's why
I brought you this little reminder.

21:29.359 --> 21:31.549
- Mistletoe.
- That's right, Jill.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.230
Let's see if it works.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.430
Thank you, Santa.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.309
Don't look at me, man.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.589
- Merry Christmas!
- Thank you, Santa.

21:48.680 --> 21:49.819
Bye, Santa.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.869
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.869
Bye, Santa. Thank you.

21:59.200 --> 22:05.109
I'll tell you. Jill, sometimes
that Wilson is one fine neighbor, huh?

22:05.200 --> 22:06.789
You mean that Wilson?

22:06.880 --> 22:09.670
Hi-ho, neighbor.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.500
Decorations are ready. Come on out. Look.

22:29.599 --> 22:33.029
Don't slip. Watch out. Come on.

22:33.119 --> 22:36.470
Hurry up. Come on.
Everybody in position?

22:37.039 --> 22:39.420
All right, sit there. Honey?

22:39.519 --> 22:42.390
The Tim Taylor Power Christmas.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.470
Voilà.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.670
Wow! Cool!

22:54.480 --> 22:56.109
Tim.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.029
Everybody, come on.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.910
Oh, that's the spirit.
