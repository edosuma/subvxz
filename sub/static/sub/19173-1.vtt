49:57.406 --> 50:00.171
Had I done more in that moment,

50:00.172 --> 50:04.269
had I been more in that moment...

50:04.802 --> 50:06.901
Charles would still be here.

50:11.832 --> 50:14.118
The idea that he might
be looking down on me

50:14.119 --> 50:15.953
in this moment and find me not doing

50:15.954 --> 50:19.724
everything in my power to
see his death answered for,

50:19.725 --> 50:22.827
that is something I'm willing
to put my life at risk over,

50:22.975 --> 50:25.506
how I'm seen in his eyes.

50:26.670 --> 50:30.167
Charles Vane stood by us
when no one else would.

50:30.168 --> 50:33.771
Charles Vane risked his life for us.

50:33.772 --> 50:34.805
Charles Vane...

50:34.806 --> 50:36.806
Oh, fuck Charles Vane.

50:42.513 --> 50:44.724
I know how you felt about him.

50:45.910 --> 50:48.210
I felt the same way, and you know it.

50:49.471 --> 50:51.237
But he's dead.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.459
And I can't see what
fucking sense it makes

50:55.460 --> 50:57.261
to keep trying to make him happy.

50:57.262 --> 51:00.463
And all it's actually gonna
lead to is you joining him.

51:03.402 --> 51:06.848
If it had been me
strung up in that square,

51:06.873 --> 51:08.938
you'd feel the same way?

51:10.035 --> 51:11.656
I came here 'cause we all agreed

51:11.681 --> 51:14.015
we had a chance to take Nassau back,

51:14.512 --> 51:16.847
have a place of our own.

51:17.326 --> 51:19.677
I ain't here to prove anything!

51:20.469 --> 51:23.036
I ain't here to figure out who I am.

51:23.855 --> 51:26.023
And I sure as shit ain't
here to pretend a dead man

51:26.024 --> 51:28.359
might think better of me for it.

51:28.360 --> 51:32.489
We are all here towards the
end of retaking the island.

51:32.919 --> 51:35.499
In terms of motive,

51:35.500 --> 51:37.888
maybe we'll all just have to accept

51:37.913 --> 51:40.337
that we're driven by different things.

51:40.338 --> 51:41.691
Yeah?

51:41.716 --> 51:43.307
And what happens when those motives

51:43.308 --> 51:45.076
start demanding their own ends?

51:45.667 --> 51:47.111
<i>And this thing we're all a part of</i>

51:47.112 --> 51:48.566
<i>starts splitting right down the middle?</i>

51:48.591 --> 51:50.992
That isn't going to happen.

51:51.951 --> 51:53.873
It already is.

51:57.058 --> 51:59.107
What did he do?

52:01.505 --> 52:03.693
<i>BONNY: Set a course for Nassau...</i>

52:07.723 --> 52:10.490
<i>to send a message when we return...</i>

52:13.769 --> 52:16.069
<i>that this can all end...</i>

52:19.418 --> 52:22.652
<i>if the governor turns over
the one thing he wants.</i>

52:37.530 --> 52:39.864
When I made the choice to see
Charles' sentence carried out,

52:39.865 --> 52:43.043
I did not know what the
consequences would be.

52:44.165 --> 52:46.504
<i>I knew it was the only way
to protect our future here,</i>

52:46.505 --> 52:48.838
<i>to protect you, so I did it.</i>

52:51.176 --> 52:53.785
And when the backlash followed,

52:54.079 --> 52:56.027
the resentment over my
relationship with you,

52:56.052 --> 52:58.315
which I knew could only
be soothed by my pretending

52:58.316 --> 53:01.786
to have no influence
at all, I did that, too.

53:01.787 --> 53:05.156
I did all of it, contorted
myself into the role,

53:05.157 --> 53:07.792
mutilated myself so that it
would fit because I believed

53:07.793 --> 53:09.426
as long as you believed
I was your partner,

53:09.427 --> 53:11.162
it didn't matter what
anyone else believed.

53:11.163 --> 53:13.330
I've never believed you to
be anything less than that.

53:13.331 --> 53:14.799
Good, then can you tell me

53:14.800 --> 53:17.425
what the fuck just happened back there?

53:17.803 --> 53:20.271
I am asking her to
bear no more sacrifice

53:20.272 --> 53:22.840
than you or I or a dozen others.

53:22.841 --> 53:24.475
You're not asking her to bear anything.

53:24.476 --> 53:27.077
You have saddled her with
the cost of those trials.

53:27.078 --> 53:29.346
You might as well have stolen
the money to pay for it,

53:29.347 --> 53:32.399
but that is not what I am
talking about and you know it.

53:33.969 --> 53:36.387
To be my partner in
this, there are things

53:36.388 --> 53:37.672
that you are better off
letting me worry about.

53:37.697 --> 53:41.091
That is not what you said.
No more silent partners.

53:41.092 --> 53:43.093
We all bear the burden of this together.

53:43.094 --> 53:45.628
<i>What is it you are not telling me?</i>

53:47.666 --> 53:50.167
I don't want to be
protected. I don't want it.

53:50.310 --> 53:53.237
I need to know why you're behaving
as if victory is so far away

53:53.262 --> 53:55.927
when to me, it seems that
it is so close at hand.

54:13.058 --> 54:15.259
When I informed Sarah of my intent

54:15.260 --> 54:17.928
to formally end our marriage,

54:18.626 --> 54:21.587
I did not know what the
consequences would be.

54:22.501 --> 54:24.168
I didn't imagine they
would be significant.

54:24.169 --> 54:26.561
We'd barely spoken in years.

54:29.107 --> 54:30.840
Her reaction...

54:33.211 --> 54:36.112
was more significant
than I'd anticipated.

54:37.441 --> 54:38.973
What did she do?

54:44.173 --> 54:48.392
Her family intervened with
a few of my larger creditors

54:48.393 --> 54:53.397
and persuaded them to accelerate
my timetables for repayment.

54:53.774 --> 54:55.383
And if those creditors call the loans,

54:55.408 --> 54:57.914
it will force the others to follow suit.

55:00.515 --> 55:02.015
I would default.

55:03.718 --> 55:05.410
The courts would issue the warrant,

55:05.435 --> 55:09.061
and I would be a fugitive from the law.

55:11.049 --> 55:12.316
England is at war.

55:12.317 --> 55:14.318
There is no money from them
to support our efforts here.

55:14.319 --> 55:18.701
So I have had to assume substantial
private debts to do so...

55:19.739 --> 55:22.583
Debts which grow by the day.

55:23.051 --> 55:25.029
And as it would seem,
the only thing more costly

55:25.054 --> 55:27.587
than our defeats are our victories.

55:29.512 --> 55:31.268
Debts which will
require the swift return

55:31.269 --> 55:33.173
of commerce here if they
are ever to be repaid,

55:33.198 --> 55:35.906
commerce whose return at the moment

55:35.907 --> 55:37.907
seems so very far away.

55:40.987 --> 55:43.020
Why didn't you tell me?

55:46.518 --> 55:49.218
You are not a compromise to me.

55:54.092 --> 55:57.560
I do not regret what I did,
no matter the consequences.

55:58.991 --> 56:02.091
And I didn't want you to have
any reason to think that I did.

56:20.819 --> 56:23.020
Her family has the ability to do that,

56:23.021 --> 56:25.421
to manipulate your creditors so easily?

56:27.007 --> 56:29.429
Creditors respond to money.

56:29.761 --> 56:32.257
And they respond to influence.

56:32.999 --> 56:34.897
Her family has both.

56:37.407 --> 56:39.173
I understand.

56:41.806 --> 56:43.406
But...

56:45.043 --> 56:47.276
