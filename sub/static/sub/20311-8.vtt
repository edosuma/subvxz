WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:04.713
Okay, let me get this straight,
Mr. Dwyer takes all the senior
students to New York,

00:04.713 --> 00:07.299
but you three don't go.

00:07.299 --> 00:11.804
The greatest city
on the planet your
senior year. Lewis, why would

00:11.804 --> 00:14.222
- you not go to New York City?
- Detention.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.975
Detention, nice.
Three day trip to
the greatest city

00:15.975 --> 00:18.686
in the world and you got
a detention. What about you?

00:18.686 --> 00:22.021
- Failing math.
- Because you're failing math,

00:22.021 --> 00:25.442
I gotta come in on my spare
and cover this class
for three days

00:25.442 --> 00:27.528
when I got lots
of stuff I could be doing.

00:27.528 --> 00:32.491
- What's your excuse?
- I have to be here
for my dialysis.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.080
What did you get
a detention for?

00:39.080 --> 00:42.710
- Uniform infraction
- Don't do that.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.422
♪ I'm awesome, no you're
not dude, don't lie ♪

00:47.422 --> 00:50.091
♪ I'm awesome, I'm driving
around in my mom's ride ♪

00:50.091 --> 00:55.180
♪ I'm awesome,
a quarter of my life gone by ♪

00:55.180 --> 00:57.850
♪ I'm awesome, awesome,
awesome ♪

00:57.850 --> 01:00.352
Hey, looks like you
had a big party at your

01:00.352 --> 01:02.604
- house last night.
- No, I was marking all night.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.024
I know, that
was a bit of sarcasm.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.150
See you in a
little bit. Stuff to do.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.611
Mr. Duncan!

01:09.611 --> 01:13.323
- Oh, hey, sir.
- This is a list of every
teacher in the school

01:13.323 --> 01:17.244
who has yet to submit a guest
speaker for tomorrow's career
day. Look whose name is on it.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.914
Just one name though,
that's not really a list.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.999
- Gerry Duncan.
- Exactly.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.834
Wow, I had my guest speaker
submitted weeks ago.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.794
- Good for you
- Yeah.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.338
You know, we take
career day pretty
seriously around here.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.717
- Last year Paul Dwyer
got us an astronaut.
- Wow.

01:31.717 --> 01:35.012
This year he's got someone
even more spectacular I hear.
Not that I expect you

01:35.012 --> 01:38.348
- to get us an astronaut.
- Okay, well, there's not

01:38.348 --> 01:41.560
really a lot of astronauts
working right now.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.311
- But get us someone
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.398
- I'm trying and I will.
- By the end of the day.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.691
Okay, that's
plenty of time.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.569
- Tick tock.
- Make it stop.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.154
You want me to take
a list that has just
one name on it?

01:53.154 --> 01:57.200
- Thank you.
- Wow, you really need
a speaker.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.788
- Yeah, no kidding.
Who do you have?
- I have a great guest speaker.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.456
He works at
a homeless shelter.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.875
Yeah, see? That's
not a good guest speaker.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.253
- It's inspiring.
- Wow, that's depressing.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.425
That's good stuff.

02:17.345 --> 02:21.266
- If you kill it, refill it.
- What?

02:21.266 --> 02:24.645
Coffee, I always
have to make the coffee.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.188
And that takes you what?
30 seconds out of your busy day?

02:27.188 --> 02:29.483
I am just as
busy as everyone else.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.486
You're just as busy
as everyone else?
You're the librarian.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.072
You sign books out.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.117
You are, you are very
funny, Mr. Duncan.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.494
( speaks foreign language )

02:40.494 --> 02:44.498
See, no one
even knows what...

02:44.498 --> 02:47.835
Morning everyone. FYI,
there is a bad flu going

02:47.835 --> 02:49.962
around the school,
so expect some absences.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.132
But whatever you do,
please don't send your
sick students

02:53.132 --> 02:55.050
- in my direction.
- Here we go.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.511
Big weekend planned
and I don't want to miss even

02:57.511 --> 03:00.597
a second of it-- frat guys,
once a year we all get together

03:00.597 --> 03:04.225
- and things get pretty wild.
- You were in a frat?

03:04.225 --> 03:06.394
I'm gonna go,
I'm gonna come crash it.

03:06.394 --> 03:10.189
No, you're not.
You weren't in the frat so
the fun would be lost on you.

03:10.189 --> 03:13.318
Doesn't matter, I know
the frat handshake.

03:13.318 --> 03:17.405
- That's impossible,
it's a secret.
- No, secret's out. See you.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.783
Trudy, can you please
print some permission slips?

03:19.783 --> 03:22.369
'Cause I for one am giving
myself permission to go

03:22.369 --> 03:28.625
- crazy this weekend.
- Yep, I'll get right on that.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.628
I heard Mr. Callaghan
is really excited to
see your speaker.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.588
Who's your speaker?

03:33.588 --> 03:37.384
This kid I used to tutor.
Did pretty well for himself,
might be okay.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.386
Just okay? Mine's awesome.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.722
( phone ringing )

03:41.722 --> 03:44.432
- Xavier Academy.
- Man: What's shakin', mama?

03:44.432 --> 03:47.061
- Got a Cheeley burger there?
- You must be calling for

03:47.061 --> 03:50.271
Mr. Robert Cheeley on a work
number that only I answer,
honey,

03:50.271 --> 03:52.733
let me put you through.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.609
Robert Cheeley.

03:54.609 --> 03:58.155
Bear! Where you been, bro?
I've been looking for you, dude.

03:58.155 --> 04:02.367
Are you in for the weekend or
not? I got the meat. Nom, nom,

04:02.367 --> 04:06.205
nom...wa hoo wa ha sis
boom ba ha, friendship.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.124
How you feel?
A little pukey?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.168
Well, your dad's gonna
be here in about 15
minutes, sweetie,

04:11.168 --> 04:13.628
- so you scoot over there.
- Robert: All teed up, bro!

04:13.628 --> 04:16.339
Got a case of sliders chillin'
like a villain in the freezer.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.508
You get to go home,
you lucky bugger.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.635
Truders, guess who
that was on the phone.

04:20.635 --> 04:25.140
- The superintendent?
- Mnh-mnh. Bear sandwich.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.601
Frat buddy, long story, it's
a nickname. Twist ending.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.229
Yeah I don't care. Listen
could you do me a favor

04:30.229 --> 04:33.107
and in future could you have
your dingus friends use your

04:33.107 --> 04:35.483
- personal number? Okay?
- Can you do me a favor?

04:35.483 --> 04:37.903
Your job, get these sick kids
out of here. They're gross.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.864
Oh, can you do
me another favor?
Turn down the volume on

04:40.864 --> 04:43.533
- the passive aggressiveness.
- Okay, uh, listen could you

04:43.533 --> 04:47.454
do me a favor Robert and
just scoot on back into
your office right quick?

04:47.454 --> 04:51.833
How about you
do yourself a favor
and be nice to people?

04:52.918 --> 04:55.045
What is wrong
with that man?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.589
One second here...
and there you are.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.759
Thank you so much,
have a great day.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.053
- Hey.
- Hi, what can I do for you?

05:03.053 --> 05:05.722
- Lost my bank card.
- Do you have ID on you?

05:05.722 --> 05:08.725
- And let's get you a new one.
- All right.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.061
Used to have the window
right here, remember?

05:11.061 --> 05:14.189
- Ah, no.
- You had to talk
through the hole.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.524
There was a...bank
card... you'd have to come in

05:16.524 --> 05:21.113
and go...
Can I get some money?

05:21.113 --> 05:25.867
It's kind of dangerous actually,
someone could just come in...

05:25.867 --> 05:29.788
come in, and shoot
you right in the face, pow!

05:29.788 --> 05:32.207
Some days I wish
somebody would.

05:32.207 --> 05:36.503
- Okay. Awesome.
- Okay, so here's your
new card and your ID.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.630
- Don't lose that one, okay?
- Thank you, I will not.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.715
And you can set your PIN
at the ATMs right over there.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.426
Perfect, thank you,
Ella, thanks.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.596
- Have a great day.
Hi, how can I help you?
- Actually, I'm not done, sorry.

05:46.596 --> 05:50.142
Ella, I'm a teacher,

05:50.142 --> 05:51.726
- career day tomorrow.
- Okay.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.979
Would you come in
and speak to my class?

05:53.979 --> 05:56.523
- Oh, I don't know
- Kids would love it.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.442
No, what about Karla,
though, she's our manager

05:59.442 --> 06:02.237
- and she's really great
with people.
- Yeah...I don't know

06:02.237 --> 06:04.572
if the kids would really...
really like that.

06:04.572 --> 06:08.576
- Okay, yeah, you know what?
I would love to. Okay?
- Yes! Deal.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.453
Gerry. Ella.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.580
- Nice to meet you, Gerry.
- Contract.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.750
- Agreed
- Okay, I'll be back later today
and we'll iron it out.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.337
- Okay, I'll talk to you then.
- Okay, thanks. Next.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.967
Oh.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.512
Duncan. Come in.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.388
- What's going on here?
- Know why I do that?

06:29.388 --> 06:31.308
Hmm, not sure
I want to know why.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.643
Same reason I grow my
own tomatoes in the summer,

06:33.643 --> 06:37.814
same reason I'm learning
to speak Russian. I like
to push myself.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.360
Hmm, growing tomatoes...
that's quite the push, sir.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.778
I like my staff to
push themselves as well.

06:43.778 --> 06:47.782
Well, here comes
your first push.
I got a guest speaker.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.493
- Terrific. Who?
- She's in the
financial services.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.162
That's fantastic.
I'll drop by tomorrow
afternoon,

06:52.162 --> 06:54.206
- have a listen.
- Yeah, you should see her.

06:54.206 --> 06:58.210
- ( speaks foreign language )
- What? I don't know
what that...

06:58.210 --> 07:00.879
- You can take my name
off that list.
- Wanna see her.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.756
- I just told you...
- When I see her.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.966
- Do you think I would lie?
- When.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.889
- Who's not here today?
- Uh, Kim.

07:10.889 --> 07:14.893
Just Kim? Okay.
All right, take that down.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.104
Mr. Duncan?
I have a question about

07:17.104 --> 07:19.356
- last night's homework.
- Okay, just one sec, Maya,

07:19.356 --> 07:22.859
let me get, just
two seconds, okay?

07:22.859 --> 07:26.238
First of all, who here likes
money? Put your hand up if you

07:26.238 --> 07:29.741
like moolah.
( snaps fingers )

07:29.741 --> 07:31.285
Jackpot,

07:31.285 --> 07:35.247
because money makes
the world go 'round.

07:35.247 --> 07:39.751
I think you are all really going
to like my guest tomorrow

07:39.751 --> 07:43.088
- for career day.
- Are they rich?

07:43.088 --> 07:46.425
- No, Maya, she's not rich.
- Will she give us cash?

07:46.425 --> 07:49.636
No, Jimmy,
she's not going to give us cash.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.931
Why are you all so focused
on the money aspect of this?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.766
Well, you just wrote money
on the board.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.894
Oh, Ben, then I will
un-write money on the board,

07:57.894 --> 07:59.562
"Mr. I have to complain

07:59.562 --> 08:04.025
and think of every
single thing."

08:04.025 --> 08:09.156
What's important is
that my guest is in
the financial industry

08:09.156 --> 08:12.159
and that is an awesome guest.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.911
I heard Mr. D has a spectacular
guest and that

08:14.911 --> 08:17.164
they're so good, we get
to go to the auditorium later.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.499
- Jimmy, get out.
- Leave?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.002
- Yeah, go.
- Right now?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.671
Right now, go,
get out of the class,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.923
wander the halls. I don't care
what you do, just leave.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.844
- Why am I leaving?
- Because you are

08:30.844 --> 08:34.889
annoying sometimes.
You want the truth?
Blame yourself for this.

08:34.889 --> 08:39.436
- Bye. This is funny to you?
- Yeah, blame yourself.

08:39.436 --> 08:44.441
Oh, you go too. Out.
Bye. I will tell the jokes.

08:44.441 --> 08:48.569
- You go ahead, ma'am.
- I can help the next person.

08:48.569 --> 08:53.533
Oh, sorry, sir.
I was next. Nice try.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.909
Hello, Ella.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.953
- Hi, Gerry
- English accent.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.623
- Anyway so, tomorrow,
thank you...
- Oh, I hate to do this to you,

09:00.623 --> 09:04.669
but it turns out they
need me here tomorrow.
I'm so sorry.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.172
Call in sick,
call in sick.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.299
- No, I have to work
- Do you think it's gonna

09:09.299 --> 09:11.134
make a difference
if one person's away?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.636
- Excuse me?
- There's like ten tellers.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.307
Everybody uses the ATM.
What's the difference
if one teller is away?

09:17.307 --> 09:20.768
It kind of makes me a terrible
choice for career day
then, doesn't it?

09:20.768 --> 09:23.522
No, that's...okay, I'll
take Karla then. Karla!

09:23.522 --> 09:25.857
- No.
- I'll ask...

09:25.857 --> 09:29.444
Goodbye, Gerry. I think
we're done here, Gerry.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.821
- Karla.
- Gerry, we're done here.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.865
- Just get Karla. Karla.
- No, no, no.

09:33.865 --> 09:37.118
You lied to me.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.038
Matt! Your cousin Matt.
You could get him to do it.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.333
He's got nothing
going on he'd love
to be your guest speaker.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.668
He's not busy, Bill,
'cause he's unemployed.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.462
Yeah, well that could
work, like a, like
a "Scared Straight" kind of,

09:47.462 --> 09:49.214
like don't be like
Matt kids, whatever.

09:49.214 --> 09:54.135
No, no I gotta
find someone good, fast.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.431
- I'll do it.
- No. Thanks.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.682
- Why not?
- You're a bartender.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.976
- It's a job.
- Not a real job.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.229
Just trying to help, man.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.991
Ah, no, it's not
actually an emergency,

10:16.991 --> 10:21.079
but can you, I need
a firefighter or
a police officer.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.374
Gotcha! No cell phones.
So who's this great guest

10:24.374 --> 10:26.709
- you have, Paul?
- Doesn't matter.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.753
The kids are gonna
love him, he's really
gonna motivate 'em.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.255
and that's all that
really matters, right?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.299
No, that's not
all that counts.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.426
- Who is it?
- You'll see.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.094
Why don't you just tell us?
Like, why is it such
a big secret

10:36.094 --> 10:38.179
for you that you
got some special guest?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.557
- Just tell us who it is.
- Who's your guest, Gerry?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.601
You'll see, not a homeless guy.

10:42.601 --> 10:46.062
I'm not bringing in
a homeless guy, okay?

10:46.062 --> 10:49.149
He's got a home, he works
at a homeless shelter.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.234
Coming in to talk to
the kids about a career.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.445
It's a really
important job, Gerry.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.614
Lisa, I think that's great.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.698
Huh, thanks.
That's what I thought too.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.034
- That's inspiring to me.
- Hear that?

11:00.034 --> 11:03.746
- ( phone buzzes )
- Ahh, oh, my guest calling.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.249
Hello?

11:06.249 --> 11:10.711
No, I'm not under duress.
No, I'm not being held

11:10.711 --> 11:13.756
against my...who is this?

11:13.756 --> 11:16.050
Woman:
Attention, please.
Any sick students waiting to be

11:16.050 --> 11:18.512
picked up by parents,
please wait in the cafeteria

11:18.512 --> 11:20.888
rather than the front office.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.017
Repeat, sick students wait
in the cafeteria.

11:25.560 --> 11:29.772
Okay, and I actually
upgraded my guest today.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.859
It's a little switch just
with some scheduling and stuff,

11:32.859 --> 11:37.030
will be here shortly, and listen
to him carefully because this is

11:37.030 --> 11:40.325
a career that a lot of you might
enjoy and don't just
pre-judge it

11:40.325 --> 11:43.244
because you think you know
what it's all about.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.623
- This is an interesting
career choice.
- So your guest sucks?

11:46.623 --> 11:48.416
I never said my
guest sucks, Maya.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.585
- Is he always late?
- The career he chose

11:50.585 --> 11:54.713
allows him to sleep in.
So no...

11:56.132 --> 11:57.884
Hey, man.
Thanks for being on time.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.760
Ah, better late
than never, eh, buddy?

11:59.760 --> 12:04.516
All right, everybody,
special guest, hard to get,

12:04.516 --> 12:08.811
restaurant entrepreneur,
Mr. William Cogill.
Very successful.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.231
Give him a hand. Come on.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.316
All right, thanks, thanks.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.277
You can call me Bill.
I'm a bartender,
work at Barrel's,

12:16.277 --> 12:20.281
- pretty nice place to work.
- A bartender? Is he supposed
to inspire us?

12:20.281 --> 12:22.825
- Would this be Ben?
- Yeah, that's Ben.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.078
All right, bartender,

12:25.078 --> 12:28.707
what questions do I get asked?
First, I don't pay taxes.
Cash business, right?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.209
Second, do you drink at work?
Yes, of course!

12:31.209 --> 12:33.794
Why would you have this job if
you don't? It's, uh, I'm half

12:33.794 --> 12:35.338
drunk most of the time.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.091
Ladies and germs,
your attention please.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.301
I will be supervising
the cafeteria this afternoon,

12:40.301 --> 12:43.054
but I do not want to come into
direct contact with any of you.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.640
Big weekend planned,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.308
if you're healthy you can ask me
about it. So here's how
it's gonna work.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.519
Rule no. 1, no sharing of food.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.231
You are walking Petri dishes of
bacteria and highly contagious.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.983
Rule no. 2, when you've finished
your lunch simply raise
your hand,

12:55.983 --> 12:59.404
do not approach me directly,
let me dismiss you
from afar,

12:59.404 --> 13:02.657
and no. 3, if you're not
feeling well, feel free to join

13:02.657 --> 13:06.077
- the sick kids at the far table
at the back of the room.
- ( coughing )

13:06.077 --> 13:09.497
Understood? Thank you.

13:09.497 --> 13:14.502
Hey, Robert, I wanted to
introduce you to my guest
speaker. This is Ken.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.838
Ken works at the Livewell
Men's Shelter downtown

13:17.838 --> 13:20.799
- and then this is
his client Gord.
- Gord.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.637
Robert, you can't catch
homeless. That's really rude.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.389
No, it's not. Welcome,
we love visitors here.

13:26.389 --> 13:30.560
Lisa, why don't you show these
gentlemen to the far table
at the back of the room?

13:30.560 --> 13:33.146
- ( coughing )
- Typical.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.857
Off you go. Gord.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.574
The mint and you want to
bruise it, not pulverize it,

13:44.574 --> 13:48.453
right, buddy?
Then the main ingredient, rum.

13:48.453 --> 13:52.081
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- That's what makes
it delicious.

13:52.081 --> 13:56.419
Okay, that is when you're old
enough, you will add the rum.

13:56.419 --> 14:00.757
- He's cute.
- That's how you make a mojito.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.467
What does Mr. Duncan drink?

14:02.467 --> 14:06.471
- Oh...coolers.
- That's what my mom drinks.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.723
Your mom's a smart lady,
'cause there's more
alcohol in a cooler

14:08.723 --> 14:10.558
and you get drunk faster.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.310
Man, this was a blast!

14:12.310 --> 14:13.936
You guys are great, you're
welcome at my job anytime

14:13.936 --> 14:16.189
- you want to come.
- When you're old enough.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.566
Obviously they've got
fake ID's, this guys
got a mustache.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.444
If you have fake ID,
I want them handed in
right now.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.238
If you do not have a fake ID,
come see me after class.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.616
- No, do not go see him ever.
- Cheers!

14:26.616 --> 14:29.118
No cheers.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.997
Who's this guy?

14:32.997 --> 14:36.125
Sometimes you have to
understand what you don't want

14:36.125 --> 14:38.461
to do with your life

14:38.461 --> 14:43.466
so know what you do want
to do with your life,
and I'll be right back.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.593
- Okay, let's go
- Me too?

14:45.593 --> 14:46.803
Yes, you too.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.351
Booze in the classroom?
Fake ID's?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.812
What were you thinking?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.814
What was I th...?

14:57.814 --> 15:00.692
Oh, he wasn't my first choice,
didn't even want him.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.151
Yeah, I wasn't.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.571
Holding out for strippers?
Drug dealer?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.948
You gonna bring that in
with the booze? A stripper
and a drug dealer, too?

15:07.948 --> 15:10.117
No, I think he's asking you,

15:10.117 --> 15:12.912
'cause you're probably
more responsible here
of the two of us.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.997
- You done?
- You done?

15:14.997 --> 15:18.668
Yeah, we're good.
You can go now if
you had something to say.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.838
This is serious. This is
a key event for Xavier.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.049
How difficult can it be to find
an appropriate guest speaker?

15:25.049 --> 15:29.596
- Well, hard, when you leave it
to the last minute, it's...
- Paul Dwyer.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.848
- That's the guy I was
telling you about.
- Oh, no, the Mr. D guy?

15:31.848 --> 15:33.349
- Yeah, the Mr. D.
- Dwyer, makes sense.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.559
The kids love him,
I don't know why.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.185
I can hear
the whispering.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.896
Sorry. Okay.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.481
Paul has asked me to accompany
his guest to the auditorium.

15:40.481 --> 15:44.360
I suggest you tag along,
you'll learn the caliber
of guest we've come to expect.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.570
I understand.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.115
Well, I'm gonna take off.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.826
Do it, try it again,
got it that time.

15:51.826 --> 15:55.121
Get out of here, go,
get out of here.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.373
I could lose
my job 'cause of you.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.917
You flinched.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.170
Who does Dwyer have?

16:09.135 --> 16:13.180
- Sweet home Alabama
- Hi. How are you?

16:13.180 --> 16:15.975
- Hi there, can I help you?
- I'm looking for
Mr. Dwyer please.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.685
Yes, you want to see him?

16:17.685 --> 16:21.272
Sure, yeah, yeah.
What's your name, sweetie?

16:21.272 --> 16:24.024
- Mike.
- Mike, Mike, last name?

16:24.024 --> 16:28.237
- Cammalleri
- Oh, God, Mike Cammalleri,

16:28.237 --> 16:29.823
the Calgary Flames
Cammalleri?

16:29.823 --> 16:32.283
- This is true.
- Oh God... yeah, see?

16:32.283 --> 16:34.118
That's why I have
this urge to vomit.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.120
- I'm sorry.
- Listen, I don't mean

16:36.120 --> 16:40.082
to insult you, buddy,
but I hate Calgary Flames,
okay?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.794
Cammaloser? Hate!
I'm an Oilers fan, sweetheart.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.505
Gretzky, Messier.

16:45.505 --> 16:49.425
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah, do you think?

16:49.425 --> 16:53.429
Cammalleri? Do you skate
like a boy? 'Cause you
walk like a girl.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.766
What? Is Mr. Dwyer
around at all?

16:56.766 --> 16:59.435
He's waitin' back stage
for you. Come on,
I'll show you.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.479
Thank you.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.024
And the more funding
they cut, the more beds
we have to lose.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.277
You're going to see
a lot more homeless people
dying in the streets,

17:08.277 --> 17:09.988
because they had
nowhere to go.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.448
People are more concerned
with what shampoo to buy

17:12.448 --> 17:15.409
or which celebrity is
pregnant than a man in the cold.

17:15.409 --> 17:20.414
Friendless, homeless
and utterly alone.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.584
Any questions
for me or Gord?

17:23.584 --> 17:26.170
Yes, Colin.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.339
- How much money do you
make begging?
- Colin!

17:28.339 --> 17:30.758
It's okay.
I made 80 bucks once.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.302
80 bucks? Man,
I want to be homeless too!

17:33.302 --> 17:37.473
So, that's why, um, you
have to stay in school.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.977
Actually,
I'm a university graduate.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.437
Didn't work out.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.565
( sighs )

17:45.565 --> 17:47.859
Dwyer:
Trust me. The kids are
gonna love him.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.527
Here's your pal.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.572
- Hey! How you doin?
- Great to see you.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.199
- Thanks for coming.
Look at you!
- Thanks for having me, man.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.117
Anything for Mr. D, you
got me through grade 12 English.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.245
- That was tough
though, right?
- It was tough.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.622
- Enough's enough,
you're coming to a game.
- You don't gotta do

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
- all that for me, man.
Thank you.
- Go to a game.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.418
It ain't all that.
Enough, you're coming.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.962
- I don't want to put
you out the way.
- Take the tickets.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.423
Gerry, if you don't mind,
this is my good friend.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.509
- Take the tickets. I'll go.
- Listen, the family's good?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.887
Family's great, man,
thank you so much for asking.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.431
Good. Listen,
Mr. Callaghan, Mike Cammalleri

18:18.431 --> 18:22.101
- Wow, Mr. Cammalleri, welcome.
Huge fan, huge fan.
- Pleasure.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.187
Paul, you've outdone
yourself this time.
This is fantastic.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.357
The kids are gonna be so
stoked. You know, I was
there the night you scored

18:28.357 --> 18:30.651
the hat trick
at the Habs' 100th birthday.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.278
That was
a really fun night.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.654
It was hard to keep
you a secret around here.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.823
This is what I'm
talking about, Duncan.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.035
You've got Mike Cammalleri,
Bill, NHL superstar, bartender.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.287
- Big time talent.
- Okay, got it when you did

18:41.287 --> 18:44.832
- the first stuff.
- Student: We're ready
for you, Mr. Callaghan.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.209
- Oh, hey.
Let's go meet the kids.
- We're ready for you.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.795
Great, yeah.

18:51.089 --> 18:54.383
- So what?
He scored some goals.
- ( students cheering )

18:54.383 --> 18:58.972
I've scored like
7,000 in my life,
different league, who cares?

18:58.972 --> 19:02.892
Thank you very much for
coming out and talking.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.312
Hey, at least you care.
Means a lot and thanks

19:06.312 --> 19:08.106
for letting us see Cammalleri
Gord's a big fan.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.316
- Great.
- Gentlemen, Lisa.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.193
Hope your weekends are as
crazy as mine promises to be.

19:13.193 --> 19:17.657
Well, good luck with
those frat shenanigans.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.993
Can't promise it's not
gonna get a little bit crazy.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.662
You never know what's gonna
happen when old Bear Sandwich
is around.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.498
Wa hoo, wa ha,
sis boom ba...

19:25.498 --> 19:30.003
Friendship. Sigma Theta Sigma.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.673
Those were the days, brother.

19:33.673 --> 19:38.427
- You're a Sigma?
- You should do the handshake.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.430
Wa hoo, wa ha,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.933
sis boom ba ha!

19:43.933 --> 19:46.226
( coughs )

19:47.603 --> 19:49.981
- Friendship.
- Friendship.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.567
Hey, Robert, don't you have
the big Sigma reunion this
weekend? He should go.

19:53.567 --> 19:58.322
- Oh, that's a great idea.
- See you Monday, Robert.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.702
You should come,
but I would hate that.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.916
- Nice to meet you guys.
- This is incredible!

20:12.670 --> 20:16.049
Well, that was good, Mike.
The kids, ah, really enjoyed it.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.551
- It was great.
- Oh, Mr. D,
thank you very much.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.720
Oh, yeah, this one's
actually for Mr. Dwyer.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.513
But I can sign you
one right here.

20:22.513 --> 20:26.059
Oh, you know what?
Nah, it's for the kids
I guess really.

20:26.059 --> 20:30.646
I played sports too,
a lot of hockey and
then I had to decide,

20:30.646 --> 20:32.606
professional athlete,
professional teacher

20:32.606 --> 20:35.609
and made this decision,
so, for the kids
probably be sitting there

20:35.609 --> 20:38.237
- if I hadn't
focused on education.
- Yeah, that's great.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.823
Teaching's so important,
It's great work you guys
are doin'.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.909
Glad you didn't talk
about droppin' out
at Michigan.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.954
- I did three years.
- Three years is not
a degree though.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.248
What are you going to
do now though when

20:49.248 --> 20:51.000
- you're done hockey, right?
- It's a good message,
kids, you know?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.127
I actually plan on getting
my degree myself, so.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.504
Yeah, so not as many kids
as you thought, eh?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
- No, we've had a good...
- Good turnout?

20:57.506 --> 20:59.842
Yeah, it was great.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.511
Well, maybe I will have
one, Mike, why not? To Gerry.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.639
- That would be great.
- To Gerry. All right, "Jerry."

21:05.639 --> 21:10.144
- "G," it's a "G," actually.
- Oh, here, let me just...

21:10.144 --> 21:12.146
Maybe, just, all right,
use a new one.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.066
- Yeah, you did a "J."
- Oh, all right, there.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.610
- There we go.
- Okay, can't really...

21:17.610 --> 21:22.448
Yeah, I can't
really say that I met you
'cause it says "to scribble."

21:22.448 --> 21:24.742
But it was great meeting you.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.412
- See how that's?
- Yeah, it's a Sharpie.
It doesn't erase.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.457
No, I know,
it's stuck, it's forever.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.293
( coughing, sneezing )

21:37.004 --> 21:39.465
( blows nose )

21:47.723 --> 21:51.060
♪ Awesome, awesome,
awesome, awesome ♪

21:51.060 --> 21:53.520
