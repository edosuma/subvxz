00:04.320 --> 00:07.155
Megan, it's so cool you're
doing an article on Ally.

00:07.156 --> 00:09.393
Your "hot new celeb"
issue of "Cheetah Beat"

00:09.394 --> 00:12.493
was so popular, readers wanted
Megan to do a follow up.

00:12.494 --> 00:16.164
Everyone wants to know about
Austin's amaze songwriter.

00:16.165 --> 00:17.298
Oh.

00:17.299 --> 00:19.283
First question for everybody.

00:19.284 --> 00:21.169
Describe Ally in one word.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.303
- Talented.
- Amaze.

00:22.304 --> 00:24.224
Girl.

00:24.406 --> 00:25.572
Oh!

00:25.573 --> 00:29.310
Hey Nelson, Mrs. Ingram. You
brought the whole class today.

00:29.311 --> 00:31.512
You ready for your big
concert this weekend?

00:31.513 --> 00:34.261
I'm afraid we bring
very sad news.

00:34.262 --> 00:36.617
The band room flooded and
ruined all the instruments.

00:36.618 --> 00:38.289
- Terrible.
- Awful.

00:38.290 --> 00:41.530
I'll never smile again.

00:42.524 --> 00:44.924
Hubba hubba.

00:45.985 --> 00:49.165
Hi, cutie. I'm Nelson.

00:50.162 --> 00:52.148
I'm flattered.

00:52.149 --> 00:55.502
But my career comes first.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.375
So, Ally.

00:57.376 --> 01:00.441
We were hoping Sonic Boom
could donate some instruments

01:00.442 --> 01:02.243
to replace the ones we lost.

01:02.244 --> 01:04.178
Honey.

01:04.179 --> 01:05.346
Hang on a sec.

01:05.346 --> 01:07.414
I am off to Tampa for
my buddy's wedding.

01:07.415 --> 01:11.126
Dad, before you go, do you think we could
donate some instruments to the school?

01:11.127 --> 01:12.320
All of theirs got ruined.

01:12.321 --> 01:13.277
Oh, honey.

01:13.278 --> 01:16.000
Nothing would make me happier than
to give these kids instruments.

01:16.001 --> 01:18.459
Except of course, selling
them to paying customers.

01:18.460 --> 01:20.527
In fact, let's do that.

01:20.528 --> 01:22.496
Let's keep them and sell them!

01:22.497 --> 01:24.657
See you.

01:26.967 --> 01:30.015
I'm so sorry. But I can't
donate any instruments.

01:30.016 --> 01:33.207
Oh. This is horribly
disappointing.

01:33.208 --> 01:36.113
Come on, kids. Let's
go cancel the concert.

01:36.114 --> 01:37.914
Aw.

01:39.381 --> 01:42.383
I wish I could help them.

01:42.384 --> 01:43.617
Wait!

01:43.618 --> 01:47.221
What if I just let the band
borrow the instruments?

01:47.222 --> 01:48.522
Great idea!

01:48.523 --> 01:52.326
They can play their concert and give the
instruments back before your Dad gets home.

01:52.327 --> 01:54.367
Nelson!

01:54.496 --> 01:56.622
Wait. You can have the
instruments, but...

01:56.623 --> 01:59.197
Have the instruments?!
Hey, everybody!

01:59.198 --> 02:01.179
Ally's going to give
us the instruments!

02:01.180 --> 02:03.337
Take what you want!

02:03.338 --> 02:04.138
No.

02:04.139 --> 02:06.466
Ally, thank you for giving
us these instruments,

02:06.467 --> 02:08.376
and letting us
keep them forever.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.168
You saved our music program.

02:10.169 --> 02:13.347
Um... but I... um... um...

02:13.348 --> 02:15.482
Um, no. Oh, wait.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.419
Uh, no no no. Not the guitars.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.596
That was so epic!

02:20.597 --> 02:22.799
Ally, you're like
the biggest hero...

02:22.800 --> 02:24.292
<i>Ever.</i>

02:24.293 --> 02:28.218
I'm totes putting
that in my article.

02:28.219 --> 02:30.139
Um...

02:31.973 --> 02:34.501
Not the piano!

02:34.502 --> 02:38.762
Did I just give away
the whole store?

02:40.559 --> 02:43.319
Yep. Pretty much.

02:43.345 --> 02:47.065
Hey, we still have this kazoo.

02:48.183 --> 02:50.169
Hey, guys! You
forgot this kazoo!

02:50.170 --> 02:52.210
Nelson!

02:55.151 --> 02:58.253
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:58.254 --> 03:01.388
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

03:01.389 --> 03:02.920
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

03:02.921 --> 03:04.539
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

03:04.540 --> 03:07.584
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

03:07.585 --> 03:10.643
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

03:10.644 --> 03:12.257
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:12.258 --> 03:14.580
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:14.581 --> 03:18.718
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:18.719 --> 03:21.754
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:21.755 --> 03:24.824
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:24.825 --> 03:28.147
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:28.148 --> 03:30.797
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:30.798 --> 03:34.175
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:34.176 --> 03:37.293
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:37.294 --> 03:41.614
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:47.924 --> 03:51.894
How are we gonna come up with
$10,000 to pay for the instruments?

03:51.895 --> 03:54.564
Why don't you just tell Mrs. Ingram
you didn't mean to give them to her.

03:54.565 --> 03:55.658
It's too late.

03:55.659 --> 04:01.559
Megan already posted on the "Cheetah Beat"
website that I saved their music program.

04:02.878 --> 04:05.338
I'm a hero.

04:07.783 --> 04:08.883
I have an idea.

04:08.884 --> 04:11.952
Why don't we just hold a fundraiser
and say it's for the music program?

04:11.953 --> 04:14.870
People love to donate
money to needy brats.

04:14.871 --> 04:16.272
But wouldn't that be dishonest?

04:16.273 --> 04:18.451
The money would go to
Sonic Boom not the brats.

04:18.452 --> 04:20.168
I mean, kids.

04:20.168 --> 04:20.928
So?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.897
Instead of raising money
to buy instruments,

04:22.898 --> 04:25.866
we're raising money to pay for
instruments you stupidly gave away.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.907
Same thing, different order.

04:28.908 --> 04:32.266
We'll stream the fundraiser live
so people can donate online.

04:32.267 --> 04:33.624
And I can perform.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.145
Austin! That would bring
in a ton of donations.

04:36.146 --> 04:38.946
It would totally save me.
Thank you!

04:38.947 --> 04:42.667
You know I'd always help you.

04:44.012 --> 04:48.494
Oh! Grade alert. Our
test scores are posted.

04:48.495 --> 04:52.045
I got an "A". Aw,
where's my plus?

04:52.046 --> 04:56.606
Oh, there it is. I had
my thumb over it.

04:56.765 --> 04:58.568
Ooh! I got a "B"!

04:58.569 --> 05:01.374
My guessing system's
getting better.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.721
I got a "C"!

05:02.722 --> 05:04.761
Aw, where's my minus?

05:04.762 --> 05:08.008
Oh wait, there it is. I
had my thumb over it.

05:08.009 --> 05:11.045
Aw man. I got a "D".

05:11.046 --> 05:13.656
Austin, that's your second
bad grade in a row.

05:13.657 --> 05:15.374
Didn't your parents
warn you about that?

05:15.375 --> 05:16.312
I know.

05:16.313 --> 05:19.460
It's just with rehearsals and dance
practice, I haven't had time to study.

05:19.461 --> 05:21.374
We have another test tomorrow.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.825
You'd better get a good grade on it
or your parents are gonna ground you.

05:24.826 --> 05:28.615
Trust me, Ally. There's no way
I'm getting another bad grade.

05:28.616 --> 05:31.175
You got another bad grade?!

05:31.176 --> 05:34.160
I was gonna study, but I had
to rehearse with my band.

05:34.161 --> 05:37.984
You're spending too much time on
music and not enough time on school.

05:37.985 --> 05:41.172
But my career is just taking off.
You want me to quit my music?!

05:41.173 --> 05:43.341
No. In fact, we're
very proud of you.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.043
You are blowing up
as the kids say.

05:46.044 --> 05:50.181
We even get alerts when there's
a new post on your fan page.

05:50.182 --> 05:51.626
There's one now.

05:51.627 --> 05:55.827
"My parents are lecturing me.
Bummer".

05:56.063 --> 05:58.089
We're not lecturing you.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.091
We're saying you
need an education.

06:00.092 --> 06:01.578
Look at me.

06:01.579 --> 06:04.094
When my career as a
hand model ended,

06:04.095 --> 06:07.231
I thankfully had my business
degree to fall back on.

06:07.232 --> 06:12.340
And now, we're the proud owners
of Moon's Mattress Kingdom.

06:12.341 --> 06:14.372
See that?

06:14.373 --> 06:17.477
Looks at your Mom's hands.
She's still got it!

06:17.478 --> 06:18.989
- Careful.
- Sorry.

06:18.990 --> 06:23.442
Mom, Dad. I promise from now on,
I'll take school more seriously.

06:23.443 --> 06:25.837
I'm sure you will.
Because you're grounded.

06:25.838 --> 06:26.652
What?!

06:26.653 --> 06:29.620
You're not leaving this house
until your grades improve.

06:29.621 --> 06:32.056
But I promised Ally I'd
perform at her fundraiser.

06:32.057 --> 06:33.090
She's counting on me.

06:33.091 --> 06:38.991
You should have thought about that
before you put music ahead of school.

06:39.364 --> 06:43.034
And it also means no pancakes.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.302
Whoa whoa whoa. Let's
not get crazy.

06:45.303 --> 06:48.339
Hey, it's for your own good.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.460
These are really good.

06:53.220 --> 06:57.382
Bummer, man. No pancakes
and no fundraiser?

06:57.383 --> 06:59.519
Ally's gonna be devastated.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.759
- How am I gonna tell her?
- Just come right out and say it.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.600
Ally, I am truly deeply sorry...

07:07.424 --> 07:12.044
But my parents won't
let me have pancakes.

07:20.468 --> 07:23.601
- Grounded? What am I gonna do now?
- I'm sorry.

07:23.602 --> 07:25.757
I was counting on you
to play the fundraiser.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.310
How could you do this?

07:27.311 --> 07:29.421
Hey, blame my parents. I
didn't ground myself.

07:29.422 --> 07:31.208
But you're the one
who didn't study.

07:31.209 --> 07:33.464
Well you're the one who gave
away all the instruments.

07:33.465 --> 07:36.402
That's because I'm a hero. It
says so in "Cheetah Beat".

07:36.403 --> 07:38.619
I'm a hero.

07:38.620 --> 07:44.520
Yeah, well "Cheetah Beat" also said that
striped pants are hot, and they're not!

07:45.095 --> 07:47.435
Sorry, Dez.

07:48.588 --> 07:50.567
So Austin's not gonna perform?

07:50.568 --> 07:53.324
He was my only chance.
Now what am I gonna do?

07:53.325 --> 07:56.517
Don't worry. We know two performers
who are totally gonna save you.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.674
- Really?!
- Yeah.

07:57.675 --> 07:59.309
I'm gonna tap dance!

07:59.310 --> 08:02.086
And I'm gonna perform
my one-woman play.

08:02.087 --> 08:04.164
"You're hired, you're fired...

08:04.165 --> 08:07.447
The Trish De La Rosa story".

08:07.448 --> 08:10.568
Oh, great. I'm saved.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:26.504 --> 08:28.784
Nailed it!

08:28.976 --> 08:30.836
Woo!

08:30.888 --> 08:33.152
Let's hear it for Nelson.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.013
Woo!

08:35.172 --> 08:37.514
For the record, I teach
him piano, not violin.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.812
Don't forget you
can donate online.

08:39.813 --> 08:43.773
Now let's look at our new total.

08:46.930 --> 08:48.592
How is that even possible?

08:48.593 --> 08:53.496
I'm guessing after Nelson,
people wanted refunds.

08:53.497 --> 08:56.624
You've had your turn, Nelson.
Up next, we have...

08:56.625 --> 08:59.403
"You're hired, you're fired...
the Trish De La Rosa story".

08:59.404 --> 09:02.673
You won't want be wanting
refunds after this.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.774
I hope.

09:06.678 --> 09:09.279
Nelson? Get off the stage.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.247
Never!

09:11.248 --> 09:12.649
Nelson, get off the...

09:12.650 --> 09:16.250
I want to play another song.

09:17.555 --> 09:21.357
Hey, Austin. I hope you're calling to
donate because it is not going well.

09:21.358 --> 09:25.318
I know. I'm watching
the Webcast.

09:26.430 --> 09:28.669
I still feel bad
about what happened.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.279
I really wish I could help.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.635
So do I.

09:31.636 --> 09:34.096
Hey, Sweetie.

09:34.892 --> 09:36.231
We're going out for the night.

09:36.232 --> 09:39.495
We trust you'll be here
studying when we get back.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.852
Don't worry. It's
just me and my books.

09:42.853 --> 09:44.104
That's the spirit.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.325
Love you.

10:13.146 --> 10:18.038
Nope, Mr. Jones. I don't have
any experience in construction.

10:18.039 --> 10:21.579
What the hey, you're hired.

10:21.872 --> 10:27.016
Aw, what do you mean I can't nap
and operate the wrecking ball?

10:27.017 --> 10:31.367
Even though it's completely
unfair, I'm an unreasonable jerk.

10:31.368 --> 10:33.888
You're fired.

10:35.058 --> 10:36.822
Bravo bravo bravo!

10:36.823 --> 10:38.138
Oh!

10:38.139 --> 10:39.843
Give it up for Trish.

10:39.844 --> 10:42.089
But I still have 15 more
jobs to get fired from.

10:42.090 --> 10:43.361
It's Dez's turn.

10:43.362 --> 10:45.162
Oh!

10:45.494 --> 10:46.748
Dez, you're on.

10:46.749 --> 10:51.249
Yes! I've waited my
whole life for this.

10:52.075 --> 10:53.935
Woo.

10:54.011 --> 10:57.556
- Hi, honey.
- Oh! Dad? Why are you back so early?

10:57.557 --> 11:00.917
I misread the invitation. Turns
out the wedding is next week.

11:00.918 --> 11:03.978
And I'm not invited.

11:04.494 --> 11:06.889
- What's going on here?
- Uh, I'm...

11:06.890 --> 11:09.707
Doing a fundraiser for
the kids' music program.

11:09.708 --> 11:13.062
Then they can buy instruments from us.
Good thinking.

11:13.063 --> 11:16.065
- I'll head back to the store now.
- No! I mean...

11:16.066 --> 11:21.966
Don't you want to see the next act?
Dez is gonna tap dance.

11:22.588 --> 11:25.393
- Definitely not.
- Um wait, wait...

11:25.394 --> 11:27.542
Ally! I'm here to perform.

11:27.543 --> 11:30.311
Ooh. I'll stick around for that.

11:30.312 --> 11:33.492
Great. Hang out awhile.

11:33.922 --> 11:37.053
- I thought you were grounded?
- I snuck out.

11:37.054 --> 11:39.057
Couldn't let you down.

11:39.058 --> 11:40.858
Aw.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.668
Dez, get off the stage!

11:42.669 --> 11:45.872
- But I've waited my whole life...
- I said get off the stage.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.753
I can wait longer.

11:51.517 --> 11:54.305
We have a very special
surprise for you...

11:54.306 --> 11:57.846
May I present Austin Moon...

11:57.891 --> 11:59.618
'S parents.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.419
Ah!

12:13.095 --> 12:16.275
Moons! Get on up here.

12:17.034 --> 12:19.101
Now, what are you doing here?

12:19.102 --> 12:23.205
Well, we felt bad that Austin couldn't
come, so we wanted to show our support.

12:23.206 --> 12:24.941
We're Mike and Mimi Moon.

12:24.942 --> 12:28.310
Proud owners of Moon's
Mattress Kingdom.

12:28.311 --> 12:32.211
There's no hassle in our castle.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.394
And on behalf of Moon's
Mattress Kingdom,

12:36.395 --> 12:40.817
we wanted to present you
with this huge check.

12:40.818 --> 12:43.068
Oh. That is a huge check!

12:43.069 --> 12:44.326
Woo!

12:44.327 --> 12:46.307
For...

12:46.755 --> 12:48.975
$10,000?!

12:49.521 --> 12:51.296
I'm speechless.

12:51.297 --> 12:52.779
Whoops.

12:52.780 --> 12:54.472
Decimal's in the wrong place.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.953
It's supposed to say $100.

12:58.272 --> 13:01.042
It's been kind of slow
at the mattress store.

13:01.043 --> 13:04.286
Sleeping bags are killing us.

13:04.287 --> 13:06.543
Still very generous.

13:06.544 --> 13:09.664
Woo. Excuse me a sec.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.590
Guys, I need your help. All I gotta do is
keep Austin's parents away from Austin,

13:13.591 --> 13:15.866
Austin away from his parents,
my Dad away from Sonic Boom,

13:15.867 --> 13:18.322
and since he knows Austin's here,
my Dad away from Austin's parents,

13:18.323 --> 13:20.128
and Austin's parents
away from my Dad.

13:20.129 --> 13:23.095
Got it? Good. Gotta go.

13:23.096 --> 13:24.896
Ah!

13:26.903 --> 13:28.545
Mr. and Mrs. Moon,

13:28.546 --> 13:33.009
your donation of $100, gets you a
VIP performance in the Sonic Boom.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.978
It starts now. Go!

13:34.979 --> 13:38.706
- Let's say hi to Lester first.
- Uh, you can't.

13:38.707 --> 13:40.027
I mean...

13:40.028 --> 13:43.025
Mr. Dawson doesn't
want to talk to you.

13:43.026 --> 13:46.461
He actually doesn't
even like you.

13:46.462 --> 13:50.542
He thinks you sell
lousy mattresses.

13:52.598 --> 13:53.780
Sorry.

13:53.781 --> 13:57.888
Lousy? Our mattresses contain
only the finest foams and fibers.

13:57.889 --> 14:02.869
And to think, we've been
so nice to that man.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.541
Dez, go give them the
VIP performance.

14:08.542 --> 14:09.410
Finally!

14:09.411 --> 14:12.035
You are in for a treat.

14:12.036 --> 14:16.249
And now for our special
special surprise.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.145
The son of Austin
Moon's parents.

14:18.146 --> 14:20.546
Austin Moon!

14:23.549 --> 14:25.732
I'm happy to be here
for a great cause.

14:25.733 --> 14:28.577
Don't forget to donate.

14:28.578 --> 14:31.308
<i>Sometimes I get in my own way.</i>

14:31.309 --> 14:33.890
<i>I need someone to say "hey".</i>

14:33.891 --> 14:36.373
<i>What are you thinking.
Your words.</i>

14:36.374 --> 14:39.860
<i>They're always just in time.
Just like a perfect rhyme.</i>

14:39.861 --> 14:43.049
<i>Like you're not even trying.</i>

14:43.050 --> 14:44.935
<i>Like pieces of a puzzle.</i>

14:44.936 --> 14:46.904
<i>Without each other.</i>

14:46.905 --> 14:49.006
<i>We're in trouble, trouble.</i>

14:49.007 --> 14:52.067
<i>Hey, I will always...</i>

15:10.136 --> 15:12.878
I think we've had enough
of the VIP treatment.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.089
We're gonna head back
to the fundraiser.

15:15.090 --> 15:17.010
Wait!

15:19.886 --> 15:21.441
I have a question for you.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.026
Oh, what is it, Sweetie?

15:23.027 --> 15:24.685
Well...

15:24.686 --> 15:26.499
No, I can't ask you guys this.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.794
Nonsense. You can ask
us anything, Dez.

15:28.795 --> 15:32.466
Okay. I'll just come
out and say it.

15:32.467 --> 15:35.418
Where do mattresses come from?

15:35.419 --> 15:36.984
- Do you want to tell him?
- No, you should. You should.

15:36.985 --> 15:38.276
- Let's tell him together.
- Okay.

15:38.277 --> 15:42.123
It's a fascinating story and,
I think you're old enough.

15:42.124 --> 15:44.360
Have a seat.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.984
The first caveman
slept on a rock.

15:46.985 --> 15:48.464
- And it wasn't that comfortable.
- No.

15:48.465 --> 15:50.019
<i>Beat beat beat beating like.</i>

15:50.020 --> 15:52.452
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beating like that.</i>

15:52.453 --> 15:54.537
<i>You know you got my
heart beat beat beat.</i>

15:54.538 --> 15:56.338
<i>Beating like hey hey.</i>

15:56.339 --> 15:57.602
<i>Hey hey.</i>

15:57.603 --> 16:00.208
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beat beat beating like.</i>

16:00.209 --> 16:02.515
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beating like that.</i>

16:02.516 --> 16:04.579
<i>You know you got my
heart beat beat beat.</i>

16:04.580 --> 16:06.449
<i>Beating like hey hey.</i>

16:06.450 --> 16:08.730
<i>Hey hey...</i>

16:17.627 --> 16:22.357
- We did it, Ally! We raised the money!
- Oh, thank you thank you thank you.

16:22.358 --> 16:23.699
Ally.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.601
I heard about the fundraiser.

16:25.602 --> 16:30.093
First the instruments, and now you've
raised $10,000 for our music program.

16:30.094 --> 16:32.641
Are there now limits
to your generosity?

16:32.642 --> 16:34.577
What? No. Actually
there are limits.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.254
Omg.

16:36.255 --> 16:37.802
You are totes heroic.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.548
Megan, I am not totes heroic.

16:39.549 --> 16:41.584
And totes humble too.

16:41.585 --> 16:46.565
This is so going on the
"Cheetah Beat" website.

16:46.980 --> 16:49.691
Did I just give away $10,000?

16:49.692 --> 16:51.616
Yep. Pretty much.

16:51.617 --> 16:53.529
I am gonna be in
so much trouble.

16:53.530 --> 16:56.147
I'm gonna be in trouble
too if my parents see me.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.700
I gotta get out of here.

16:58.701 --> 17:01.679
- Guys! I have to tell you something.
- My parents are on their way back?

17:01.680 --> 17:05.180
Yeah, but that's not it. Did you know the
first waterbeds were invented by Vikings?

17:05.181 --> 17:09.612
- That is so not true.
- Here they come!

17:09.613 --> 17:12.133
Hey, you two.

17:13.184 --> 17:16.003
Dez, want to hear about
the history of bunk beds?

17:16.005 --> 17:17.309
- Do I?!
- Dez!

17:17.310 --> 17:20.190
But not right now.

17:21.558 --> 17:22.659
Megan!

17:22.660 --> 17:25.290
Why don't you come take some
more photos of Austin's parents?

17:25.290 --> 17:27.781
Oh. Totes fantast.

17:27.781 --> 17:30.080
You need extreme
close-up photos.

17:30.081 --> 17:32.661
Let me do it.

17:32.669 --> 17:34.309
- Oh.
- Oh, whoa.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.505
Hey, that's bright. Okay.

17:36.506 --> 17:38.366
- Ah.
- Good job.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.206
Well, as soon as my
vision comes back,

17:40.207 --> 17:42.567
I think we'll just pick up dinner
and take it home to Austin.

17:42.568 --> 17:45.073
Yeah. He stayed home
and studied all night.

17:45.074 --> 17:47.583
- It's the least we could do.
- Watch out for the spots, honey.

17:47.584 --> 17:49.504
Okay.

17:49.629 --> 17:52.555
That was way too close.
Austin almost got caught.

17:52.556 --> 17:56.258
I know. But if he beats his parents
home, they'll never know he was here.

17:56.259 --> 17:58.779
Austin rocked.

18:00.003 --> 18:03.202
Oh, there's Mike and Mimi, I better
go tell them how great their son was.

18:03.203 --> 18:04.633
You can't!

18:04.634 --> 18:07.670
I mean, they don't
want to talk to you.

18:07.671 --> 18:11.574
Actually, they don't even like you.
They think you sell lousy instruments.

18:11.575 --> 18:14.395
- Sorry.
- Lousy?!

18:14.719 --> 18:18.679
And to think, I have been
so nice to those people.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.660
Humph.

18:21.749 --> 18:25.521
Your Dad's heading back to Sonic Boom.
Do you want me to stop him?

18:25.522 --> 18:27.217
What's the point?

18:27.218 --> 18:30.061
There's no way to hide
what happened anymore.

18:30.062 --> 18:33.068
- I'm gonna go talk to my Dad.
- Well, what about Austin?

18:33.069 --> 18:34.940
You gotta buy him some time.

18:34.941 --> 18:37.272
His parents are driving
home and he's running.

18:37.273 --> 18:42.313
I don't want Austin to
get in trouble like me.

18:42.405 --> 18:45.939
Kids! Let's all think the
moons for their donation.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.220
Group hug!

18:48.983 --> 18:50.613
Watch the hands.

18:50.614 --> 18:54.574
Hey, that's my wallet.
All right.

18:56.686 --> 18:59.522
<i>I can feel your heart beat
beat beat beating and...</i>

18:59.523 --> 19:01.149
<i>Heyo, heyo.</i>

19:01.150 --> 19:03.165
<i>Heyo, heyo...</i>

19:03.166 --> 19:06.528
<i>I can feel your heart beat...</i>

19:06.529 --> 19:09.289
Aah! What the...?

19:10.242 --> 19:13.422
We've been robbed. Oh!

19:13.536 --> 19:16.132
No, Dad. That's not
what happened.

19:16.133 --> 19:18.702
You sold all the instruments?
Great!

19:18.703 --> 19:21.367
- No, I gave them all away.
- Oh.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.413
But then I raised $10,000
to pay for them.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.388
- Great!
- Then I gave that away too.

19:26.389 --> 19:28.189
Oh.

19:28.451 --> 19:29.770
All right, I can't
take this anymore.

19:29.771 --> 19:32.220
Please tell me this story
has a happy ending.

19:32.221 --> 19:33.689
The kids have new instruments,

19:33.690 --> 19:37.346
and enough money to keep the
program going for years?

19:37.347 --> 19:41.127
I meant a happy ending for me!

19:41.531 --> 19:43.332
I'm really sorry, Dad.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.602
You...

19:44.603 --> 19:47.037
Are in big trouble.

19:47.038 --> 19:48.861
I'm gonna have to punish you.

19:48.862 --> 19:51.502
I am... I'm...

19:51.641 --> 19:55.418
You've never done anything wrong before,
I'm not really sure what to do.

19:55.419 --> 20:00.759
- I'll help you think of something.
- Oh, thank you.

20:06.323 --> 20:09.658
- Oh, that was really good.
- Yeah.

20:09.659 --> 20:12.225
Let's go see Austin.

20:12.226 --> 20:15.013
Hey, buddy. We got
pancakes for you.

20:15.014 --> 20:19.234
You may not think so, but staying home
to study was the right thing to do.

20:19.235 --> 20:20.669
Yep.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.250
I was here.

20:22.251 --> 20:24.143
All night.

20:24.144 --> 20:26.356
Really learned my lesson.

20:26.357 --> 20:30.977
- I love you guys.
- Aw, we love you too.

20:32.629 --> 20:34.683
Fan alert.

20:34.684 --> 20:37.349
"Check out Austin's
amazing performance...

20:37.350 --> 20:40.723
From tonight's music
for kids-a-thon".

20:40.724 --> 20:44.684
Austin Monica Moon,
get back here!

20:45.141 --> 20:48.564
You snuck out and performed
at Ally's fundraiser?

20:48.565 --> 20:51.400
I had to. I couldn't
let her down.

20:51.401 --> 20:54.570
You can ground me forever. And
I'll never eat another pancake.

20:54.571 --> 20:58.351
Oh, you got that right, mister.

20:59.409 --> 21:01.343
I didn't mean that last part!

21:01.344 --> 21:04.858
That's just the beginning
of your punishment.

21:04.859 --> 21:08.976
Wasn't making my middle name
Monica punishment enough?

21:08.977 --> 21:11.317
Go to bed.

21:11.488 --> 21:15.448
We'll finish this
in the morning.

21:16.236 --> 21:20.840
Psst! Austin? Want to sneak
out and go see a movie?

21:20.841 --> 21:23.426
Oops. Wrong house.

21:23.427 --> 21:25.767
Mike. Mimi.

21:36.646 --> 21:39.182
Wow. Look at all these people!

21:39.183 --> 21:41.188
This place is really packed.

21:41.189 --> 21:43.973
Yeah. Thanks to the publicity
we got from "Cheetah Beat,"

21:43.974 --> 21:46.845
sales have been going
through the roof.

21:46.846 --> 21:50.002
Psst! Austin? Want to go
see that movie later?

21:50.003 --> 21:52.467
You don't have to keep popping
your head up everywhere.

21:52.468 --> 21:55.059
And I can't go to the movies.
I'm still grounded.

21:55.060 --> 21:58.161
My parents are making me
read all these books.

21:58.162 --> 21:59.386
Lucky.

21:59.387 --> 22:03.558
My punishment is I'm not
allowed to read any books.

22:03.559 --> 22:06.769
Hey, son. Are you ready to...

22:06.770 --> 22:08.307
Lester...

22:08.308 --> 22:09.776
Mike.

22:09.777 --> 22:11.470
Mimi.

22:11.471 --> 22:13.370
Lester!

22:13.371 --> 22:16.791
We'll be in the car son.

22:21.941 --> 22:26.163
Wow, your parents really don't
like each other, do they?
