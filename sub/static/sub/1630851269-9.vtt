WEBVTT

00:08.240 --> 00:11.400
Previously on Meerkat Manor...

00:11.520 --> 00:14.160
Roving season kicked off
in style...

00:14.280 --> 00:17.920
with Daisy's Ubuntu girls
becoming moving targets

00:18.040 --> 00:20.640
for Hakuna Matata rovers.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.680
First, serial dater Shandy,

00:25.960 --> 00:29.120
then his brother Belphegor.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.880
A dust storm whipped
through the Manor...

00:36.240 --> 00:41.320
During which three of Swift's
eldest daughters disappeared,

00:41.440 --> 00:46.080
leaving the treacherous Pandi
as her most senior subordinate.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.040
As the breeding season heats up
in the Kalahari,

01:46.080 --> 01:48.800
family changes are underway.

01:50.960 --> 01:55.520
The imminent arrival of
new borns exposes tensions...

01:55.560 --> 01:57.560
and causes rifts.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.200
But from these divisions,
new alliances can form...

02:05.240 --> 02:08.120
and new dynasties may rise.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.960
Fortune can favour the brave
but...

02:14.000 --> 02:18.720
those departing
must make smart choices...

02:20.480 --> 02:22.240
or get lucky.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.040
Life has already changed
at the Whiskers.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.680
It's been two weeks since Bones,
Crimson and Epsilon left home,

02:44.720 --> 02:48.640
leaving Swift
short of three senior females.

02:50.280 --> 02:55.040
Their disappearance
has come at a bad time.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.120
She's nearing the end
of her pregnancy

02:57.160 --> 03:00.480
and is going to need all the
babysitting help she can get

03:00.520 --> 03:03.280
with her third litter this year.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.760
But right now,
her hormones are raging

03:07.800 --> 03:11.280
and she's evicting anyone
who could pose a danger

03:11.320 --> 03:13.080
to her new pups.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.880
Last night, she kicked out
daughters Pandi and Mercy.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.320
Pandi proved untrustworthy
earlier in the year

03:27.360 --> 03:29.080
when she attacked her mother

03:29.120 --> 03:31.920
in an aggressive attempted coup.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.400
She's hardly redeemed herself;

03:40.440 --> 03:44.080
offering little help since
becoming Swift's deputy.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.440
And, if she's been seduced
by a rover,

03:49.480 --> 03:52.400
she could also be pregnant...

03:52.440 --> 03:55.280
...making her the greatest
domestic threat

03:55.320 --> 03:57.360
to Swift's new litter.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.840
Mercy may also be a problem.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.400
But this morning,

04:08.440 --> 04:11.880
the two evictees are still
hovering nearby -

04:11.920 --> 04:16.640
in the desperate hope that their
mother will change her mind.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.080
Swift is normally resolute
in these matters.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.200
But her decision
to evict the pair

04:21.240 --> 04:25.080
exacerbates
her childcare problem.

04:25.120 --> 04:29.960
She's effectively sacked her
nannies before hiring new ones.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.800
But could she really consider

04:32.840 --> 04:37.120
giving treacherous Pandi
another chance?

04:37.160 --> 04:42.720
Or has their relationship
reached the point of no return?

04:54.960 --> 04:58.280
While Swift is having problems
with her daughters,

04:58.320 --> 05:02.720
Ubuntu matriarch Daisy has girl
trouble of her own.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.000
It's her daughters'
dating profiles

05:08.040 --> 05:10.040
that are giving her a headache.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.560
For the past few weeks,

05:16.600 --> 05:19.240
her patch has become
the go-to hang out

05:19.280 --> 05:23.440
for every frisky young buck
on the manor.

05:23.480 --> 05:28.080
But woe-betide anyone
who falls for their charms.

05:28.120 --> 05:32.720
Pregnant daughters here face the
same fate as everywhere else.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.760
To add to Daisy's problems,

05:37.800 --> 05:43.880
her two eldest females Ricky
and Wren have recently vanished.

05:43.920 --> 05:48.360
And this morning,
The Native has gone too.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.280
It's all getting a bit much.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.400
Daisy leans heavily
on the help

06:04.440 --> 06:07.440
and without her best
babysitters to supervise,

06:07.480 --> 06:09.720
the kids are running amok.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.320
It's a situation
she could well do without,

06:15.360 --> 06:18.840
now that she too
is pregnant again.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.280
Still, routines
must be stuck to,

06:26.320 --> 06:30.640
and she heads out
in search of a hearty breakfast.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.280
But it's her son Mik-kel
who hits the jackpot.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.280
A bird's egg
is tough to crack

06:45.480 --> 06:49.040
but once he's in,
Daisy can't resist.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.920
Sunny side up or scrambled -

06:52.960 --> 06:56.200
it's too good for a lowly
subordinate!

07:00.600 --> 07:02.320
Poor Mikkel!

07:05.600 --> 07:08.840
While Daisy and her boys
are distracted...

07:10.200 --> 07:11.800
they miss...

07:11.840 --> 07:14.040
not just one...

07:14.080 --> 07:18.200
but two mystery males
heading their way.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.120
It looks like Daisy's headache

07:22.160 --> 07:24.880
is about to get
a whole lot worse.

07:33.840 --> 07:38.520
A short distance away,
Hakuna Matata rover Belphagor

07:38.560 --> 07:41.800
is also seeking his luck
in Ubuntu territory.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.880
But this time,
he's brought a sidekick...

07:47.920 --> 07:50.360
...his nephew, Gurke.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.400
With barely six months
between them,

07:55.440 --> 07:56.920
the boys are like brothers

07:56.960 --> 08:00.240
and the partnership
is already bearing fruit.

08:02.400 --> 08:07.320
They've scored a double date
with none other than...

08:07.360 --> 08:12.240
Daisy's missing duo:
Ricky and Wren.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.040
Together, this foursome
has enormous potential.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.360
If one couple can make
a go of it,

08:24.400 --> 08:28.560
and the other two accept them,
they could start a new family.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.560
A new dynasty even!

08:32.600 --> 08:36.720
With either Ricky
or Wren as matriarch.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.880
But being shy
and inexperienced,

08:44.920 --> 08:47.920
no-one wants to
make the first move.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.080
Eventually Belphagor
plucks up the courage

09:08.120 --> 09:10.920
to make a move on Ricky.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.240
That's a no.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.160
Gurke tries his luck with Wren.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.480
No thank you!

09:28.920 --> 09:33.120
Wren then makes
a play for Belphagor.

09:33.160 --> 09:36.480
Now, this looks promising!

09:36.520 --> 09:39.640
With this move,
Wren fires the starter gun

09:39.680 --> 09:42.120
on the race
to be dominant female.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.400
But where there are winners,
there are losers.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.560
Young Gurke eyes up Ricky.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.640
But she barely notices him.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.360
The chemistry just isn't there.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.200
Leaving this
one awkward double date.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.960
Further south,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.960
things are getting increasingly
uncomfortable at the Whiskers.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.840
All eyes are trained

10:19.880 --> 10:23.440
on Swift's evicted daughters,
Pandi and Mercy,

10:23.480 --> 10:25.760
who are refusing to leave.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.240
Swift is ready to call time
on this unhappy relationship.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.520
There'll be no pandering
to Pandi.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.920
Or clemency for Mercy.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.960
The younger girls are unsettled
by their mother's ruthlessness.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.960
It could be one of them next.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.840
Brea has seen all this
mother-daughter drama before.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.160
It's not his business
to get involved.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.520
But he can show his support,

11:23.560 --> 11:26.800
with a confident swipe
of his scent gland...

11:26.840 --> 11:32.120
which reminds everyone that
he's the man around here.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.600
Job done, Swift resumes
the day's other priorities.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.120
Family feuds are exhausting.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.840
She'd just like to forget
all about it and move on.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.560
In Ubuntu territory,
the two rovers are still lurking

12:01.600 --> 12:05.440
unnoticed by Daisy
and her family...

12:05.480 --> 12:08.160
who are otherwise occupied.

12:12.760 --> 12:17.480
The mystery boys are Pixie,
and his brother Jay.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.880
They're from neighbouring
group - the Zulus.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.480
There's no love lost
between the two families

12:27.520 --> 12:31.320
but the brothers are here
to find some.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.720
Daisy is exhausted

12:40.760 --> 12:44.000
from being lumbered
with the kids all morning.

12:44.040 --> 12:48.640
but just as she settles down,
her lookout spots something.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.040
Not the advancing rovers
who are keeping a low profile.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.160
But someone else

12:57.200 --> 13:00.800
whose world has already
been turned upside down.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.760
How the tortoise got like this
is anyone's guess...

13:14.800 --> 13:18.320
but with no-one
coming to his rescue...

13:18.360 --> 13:20.480
he's left to sort himself out.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.440
The temporary distraction
has bought Pixie and Jay

13:30.480 --> 13:33.320
enough time to move in closer...

13:38.200 --> 13:39.360
Where they discover

13:39.400 --> 13:43.120
that the only eligible females
Daisy has left

13:43.160 --> 13:46.280
are Magalee and Mamoof.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.720
Two sisters for two brothers.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.320
Perfect!

13:52.640 --> 13:55.360
If the boys can split
Ubuntus defences

13:55.400 --> 13:59.200
with a two-pronged attack,
they could be in with a chance.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.000
But Daisy clocks the intruders.

14:11.480 --> 14:16.600
Pixie turns on his heels and
everyone falls in to give
chase...

14:19.640 --> 14:22.440
...but he vanishes.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.760
His tactic leaves Ubuntu's
right flank exposed -

14:25.800 --> 14:29.080
giving Jay
an unguarded way in.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.520
Oh no you don't!

14:41.760 --> 14:43.320
Lost him.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.840
Pixie reappears...

14:50.880 --> 14:52.680
and the chase is on again!

14:55.920 --> 14:59.760
He narrowly escapes
a severe beating from Scar.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.000
While Mikkel sends Jay packing.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.240
Despite their daring manoeuvres,

15:14.280 --> 15:17.680
the Zulu boys leave
empty-handed.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.560
Oh well.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.200
Some you win, some you lose.

15:27.640 --> 15:30.560
For Daisy,
victory over the Zulu rovers

15:30.600 --> 15:32.120
puts a temporary end

15:32.160 --> 15:34.960
to the mayhem
surrounding her daughters.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.320
She may yet retain a few
to help with the childcare.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.320
Family planning
of a different sort

15:57.360 --> 16:01.040
is preoccupying the last of
Daisy's missing daughters,

16:01.080 --> 16:02.600
The Native.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.520
While her family has been
chasing off rovers,

16:08.560 --> 16:12.920
she's been courting
the attentions of one.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.600
And she's on the brink of
landing herself quite a catch.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.320
As his tracking collar
would indicate,

16:21.360 --> 16:23.840
Lewie was, until recently,

16:23.880 --> 16:27.160
the dominant male
of a group called Namakwa.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.560
But, having been kicked out
by his partner's new man,

16:35.600 --> 16:39.560
he's now single again,
and available.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.840
Unfortunately for The Native,
Lewie doesn't have the air

16:44.880 --> 16:47.960
of one in a hurry
to settle down again.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.960
Tired of waiting for him
to make a move,

16:57.640 --> 16:59.520
she takes the initiative.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.440
And, dispensing with
the small talk,

17:03.480 --> 17:08.000
makes her admiration for him
abundantly clear.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.200
Lewie, divorced dad of 15 ,

17:16.240 --> 17:20.000
turns out to be more than happy
to father a few more.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.600
Unfortunately, The Native
doesn't have much experience

17:27.640 --> 17:29.080
of roving males.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.800
She's about to learn
the hard way

17:34.840 --> 17:37.560
that all too often
they'll love you,

17:37.600 --> 17:39.200
then leave you.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.600
And, sure enough,
having taken full advantage

17:44.640 --> 17:48.880
of the young hopeful,
Lewie slips away.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.560
Leaving The Native
to ponder their brief encounter

17:56.600 --> 17:58.400
and what might have been.

18:13.920 --> 18:18.160
Things are finally hotting up
for the absent Ubuntu girls

18:18.200 --> 18:20.600
on their double date.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.280
Ricky has crashed Wren
and Belphagor's grooming party.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.840
She turns her attention to Wren,

18:30.880 --> 18:34.360
as Belphagor
makes his move on her.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.800
Poor Gurke
doesn't know where to look.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.520
Thankfully,
something distracts his eye

18:51.920 --> 18:53.880
but there's no escape!

18:59.040 --> 19:01.800
He's surrounded by Spring fever.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.280
Behind him,
Ricky has now given up,

19:09.320 --> 19:14.400
leaving would-be dominants
Wren and Belphagor to it.

19:14.440 --> 19:18.480
It looks like uncle Belphagor
has got this wrapped-up.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.080
Or... maybe not?

19:26.120 --> 19:29.840
Wren is
keeping her options open.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.360
Gurke seizes his chance
and Wren responds positively

19:33.400 --> 19:36.760
to the youngster's
rather bold approach.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.880
Belphagor has missed
his moment to shine.

19:47.680 --> 19:52.040
How could it all go so wrong so
quickly?

19:59.280 --> 20:01.560
The new lovers embrace...

20:04.200 --> 20:06.000
for 20 minutes!

20:17.600 --> 20:22.160
Belphagor should be putting up
a fight for dominance...

20:22.200 --> 20:25.320
but instead,
he opts for a nap.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.080
It's too hot to bother
contesting it.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.360
As long as Ricky
doesn't challenge her,

20:42.400 --> 20:46.240
Wren will most likely
be crowned leader.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.880
But it's still very early days.

20:50.920 --> 20:55.560
And The course of true love
never did run smooth .

21:05.040 --> 21:08.360
As the sun sets
on a complicated day,

21:08.400 --> 21:12.200
the drama is far from over
at the Whiskers burrow.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.560
Swift and the rest of the family
are on edge

21:17.600 --> 21:20.840
as they arrive back
for the night.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.320
They have company.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.640
Pandi and Mercy
have still not accepted

21:30.680 --> 21:32.640
they are no longer welcome...

21:32.680 --> 21:35.720
and are loitering with intent.

21:38.280 --> 21:41.080
Pandi has good reason
to want readmission.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.040
As Swift's eldest daughter,

21:43.080 --> 21:45.920
she stands to inherit
the Whiskers crown,

21:45.960 --> 21:49.720
but she can only do that
from within the family.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.080
Cast adrift, she'll be
just another evictee

21:56.120 --> 21:57.840
in the wilderness.

22:01.120 --> 22:06.000
With her pups due any day now,
Swift could really use the help.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.240
But Pandi can't be trusted.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.840
Swift needs to
put an end to this.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.120
Once and for all.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.880
Finally,
the girls get the message.

22:41.720 --> 22:45.280
Swift won't allow anyone
to endanger her family.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.040
Her decisive move

22:50.080 --> 22:53.800
would have made her
great-grandmother Flower, proud.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.440
But the turmoil of family change
may not yet be over...

23:07.680 --> 23:12.400
...and for others on the Manor,
it has only just begun.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.840
After seven months
of drought,

23:20.840 --> 23:23.240
that thirst is being quenched.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.080
In Hakuna Matata territory,

23:25.080 --> 23:26.920
Gurke has returned home.

23:26.920 --> 23:31.280
He's welcomed back with a good
dousing of Hakuna Matata scent.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.000
Ubuntu leader Daisy is over
halfway through her pregnancy.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.680
The biggest threat she faces
is not from rovers,

23:38.680 --> 23:40.880
but from her closest kin.
