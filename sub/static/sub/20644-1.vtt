00:33.400 --> 00:35.868
- Angels,
higher spirits, messengers

00:36.436 --> 00:39.605
from the invisible spirit
world have been known

00:39.607 --> 00:42.708
by many cultures for
thousands of years.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.045
Today, people around the globe
are still sighting angels

00:46.047 --> 00:49.715
and reporting what they
have witnessed to others,

00:49.717 --> 00:53.585
further expounding on
legends of divine spirits

00:53.587 --> 00:55.387
sent by god.

01:18.278 --> 01:22.214
Sightings of angels have been
documented in recent times.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.683
An angel sighting can
be a bit different

01:24.685 --> 01:26.919
than most might suspect.

01:26.921 --> 01:30.289
Many sightings of angels are
actually mysterious visitors

01:30.291 --> 01:33.358
who show up, provide
assistance of some sort

01:33.360 --> 01:37.029
and then vanish as
quickly as they appeared.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.599
Usually, the person who
experiences this type

01:40.601 --> 01:43.735
of spirit intervention will
not necessarily see the angel

01:43.737 --> 01:47.106
appear or disappear
but will later realize

01:47.108 --> 01:50.442
that the benevolent,
human looking stranger

01:50.444 --> 01:53.212
that vanished had
to be an angel.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.181
Typically, this type
of angel sighting

01:56.183 --> 01:58.884
takes the person by
complete surprise

01:58.886 --> 02:01.587
and occurs during
a time of need.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.491
Other angel sightings
are quite dramatic

02:05.493 --> 02:07.960
and describe a light
being of some sort

02:07.962 --> 02:12.131
who provides a word of
guidance or caution.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.733
This type of angelic
sighting is often described

02:14.735 --> 02:17.536
as life changing with
the angel presence

02:17.538 --> 02:20.472
being full of love and peace.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.975
Although having an angel
sighting such as this

02:22.977 --> 02:26.912
can be intimidating, often
the people who have been

02:26.914 --> 02:29.348
fortunate enough to
have such an experience

02:29.350 --> 02:33.085
describe having felt
calm and not frightened.

02:34.187 --> 02:36.221
Sometimes, people may
have angel sightings

02:36.223 --> 02:37.689
through a vision.

02:37.691 --> 02:42.661
Perhaps while dreaming or
during near death experiences.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.963
The word angel means messenger

02:44.965 --> 02:48.333
and throughout biblical
writings, there are
various accounts

02:48.335 --> 02:51.403
of angel sightings
and visitations.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.839
Most every account
found within the Bible

02:53.841 --> 02:57.609
describe angels as being
human in appearance

02:57.611 --> 02:59.111
and without wings.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.315
For example, three angels
appearing to Abraham

03:03.317 --> 03:06.818
who looked like men, Jacob
wrestling with an angel

03:06.820 --> 03:10.422
and the two angels who visited
lot and looked like men.

03:10.424 --> 03:15.394
Angels were not described as
having wings until artists

03:15.396 --> 03:19.031
began painting them that way
after orthodox christianity

03:19.033 --> 03:21.800
was officially
formed in 325 a.D.

03:24.070 --> 03:27.339
Earlier Christian art did not
represent angels very often

03:27.341 --> 03:30.842
and when they did, they
appeared in frescoes.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.046
Angels were often
represented as other things.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.716
For example, in some paintings
an angel was indicated

03:37.718 --> 03:39.284
by doves.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.954
In another painting,
an angel or messenger

03:41.956 --> 03:44.556
is depicted as the hand of god.

03:45.758 --> 03:48.227
Roman emperor,
constantine, changed things

03:48.229 --> 03:51.863
when he formed christianity
into a state religion

03:51.865 --> 03:54.933
through his council
of nicaea in 325.

03:56.302 --> 03:59.004
It would be after this that
angels would eventually

03:59.006 --> 04:03.775
be depicted in paintings and
art with wings and halos.

04:03.777 --> 04:07.045
If an angel is seen, they
are typically described

04:07.047 --> 04:08.380
one of two ways.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.084
Either they are human in
appearance or they are described

04:12.086 --> 04:14.253
as spirit bodies of light.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.357
Many appear as humans for
they are human spirits.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.959
Many times, angels
help and assist people

04:21.962 --> 04:24.896
and the ones they help
are completely unaware

04:24.898 --> 04:26.231
of who they are.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.204
For example, there are
numerous accounts of angels

04:32.206 --> 04:35.073
rescuing people,
coming out of nowhere

04:35.075 --> 04:38.710
then disappearing as
quickly as they manifested.

04:38.712 --> 04:42.914
The people rescued never knew
they were saved by an angel

04:42.916 --> 04:45.984
until they think about
the experience later.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.954
An example of this is found
within the new testament.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.523
Do not forget to
entertain strangers

04:51.525 --> 04:55.160
for by so doing, some people
have entertained angels

04:55.162 --> 04:56.728
without knowing it.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.099
Sometimes people have described
seeing a glowing messenger

05:01.101 --> 05:04.136
through dreams or visions
and these visitors

05:04.138 --> 05:07.339
are often enveloped
in a bright light.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.709
They emanate peace and love
which can be tangibly felt,

05:10.711 --> 05:13.445
bringing a message
of importance.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.780
There are multiple stories
of angelic encounters

05:48.782 --> 05:50.549
in modern times.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.518
Rose benvenuto swerved
to avoid hitting a dog

05:53.520 --> 05:56.888
and ended up in a
severe accident.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.925
Amazingly, she survived
but what was captured

05:59.927 --> 06:04.262
in a photo near the wreckage
was also fascinating.

06:04.264 --> 06:07.899
Benvenuto saw her angel
and said the proof

06:07.901 --> 06:09.601
is in the photographs.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.870
Only my guardian angel
could've saved me

06:11.872 --> 06:13.672
from such an accident,

06:13.674 --> 06:17.409
she related to her story
to abc news in 2013.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.148
Dr. frank oski was in
residency when he saw an angel

06:23.150 --> 06:27.719
appear as bright as the sun
in a dying patient's room.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.589
The angel, I don't know
what else to call her,

06:30.591 --> 06:34.025
said that life is an endless
cycle of improvements

06:34.027 --> 06:37.696
and that humans are
not perfect yet.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.265
She said that most
people have this secret

06:40.267 --> 06:44.102
revealed to them when they die
but that handicapped children

06:44.104 --> 06:47.406
often know this and
endure their problems

06:47.408 --> 06:50.842
without complaining because
they know that their burdens

06:50.844 --> 06:51.676
will pass.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.514
Some of these children,
she said, have been given

06:55.516 --> 06:59.718
the challenge of teaching
the rest of us how to love.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.520
Oski wrote about his experience

07:01.522 --> 07:03.955
in a major pediatric journal.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.926
Lilly lunardi was an FBI agent,

07:07.928 --> 07:12.097
retired from post traumatic
stress disorder after 9/11

07:12.099 --> 07:16.368
and refrained to tell her story
in fear of being ostracized.

07:16.370 --> 07:19.271
According to a 2012
report in the Blaze,

07:19.273 --> 07:23.308
lunardi told her inner circle
that she began to see a light

07:23.310 --> 07:25.277
that was blinding.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.213
All at once, the
mist took full shape

07:28.215 --> 07:30.849
and I saw what
appeared to be angels.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.085
There were angels
standing in the open area

07:34.087 --> 07:36.388
to the left of the crash site.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.890
There were hundreds of
them standing in columns.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.394
There was a field of angels
emerging from the rims

07:42.396 --> 07:43.895
of the mist.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.431
They were archangels with
their wings arched up

07:46.433 --> 07:47.766
towards the sky.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.737
Dr. Ron Phillip was
driving in Alabama

07:52.739 --> 07:55.740
to a church event
when it stated snowing

07:55.742 --> 07:59.277
and his car skidded towards
the edge of an embankment,

07:59.279 --> 08:01.880
losing control of his car.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.850
He told charisma
magazine, he prayed to god

08:04.852 --> 08:07.686
and the lord commanded
Phillip to tell his angel

08:07.688 --> 08:08.753
to help him.

08:09.889 --> 08:12.157
Seeing a faint glow,
the angel was sitting

08:12.159 --> 08:14.292
in the passenger seat.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.995
Later, a state trooper
wondered how Phillip

08:16.997 --> 08:19.197
made it through
the dangerous road,

08:19.199 --> 08:23.902
wishing him and his
passenger a safe ride home.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.472
Phillip was the only
person in the vehicle.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.344
Erin Potter was
battling with cancer

08:32.346 --> 08:36.181
since first diagnosed
with leukemia in 2007.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.783
After her cancer returned
for a third time,

08:38.784 --> 08:43.255
she was preparing for a
second bone marrow transplant.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.324
On a normal day, Erin was
playing out in the backyard

08:46.326 --> 08:50.629
one day with her sparklers
when her mom took a photo.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.298
Nothing seemed out of the
ordinary but when she looked

08:53.300 --> 08:57.035
at the photo, she was shocked
to see an angelic figure

08:57.037 --> 08:59.037
watching over the child.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.774
Just after the picture was
taken, Erin successfully

09:02.776 --> 09:06.945
received her transplant and
is now completely cancer free.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.351
14 year old Chelsea banton
was suffering from multiple

09:13.353 --> 09:16.521
development disabilities
and has been in and out

09:16.523 --> 09:19.090
of the hospital countless times.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.126
As pneumonia was
taking over her life,

09:21.128 --> 09:25.196
her mother had to make
an unthinkable decision.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.265
She asked the doctor
to pull the plug

09:27.267 --> 09:29.768
on Chelsea's life
machine to end her years

09:29.770 --> 09:31.836
of pain and suffering.

09:31.838 --> 09:35.440
As she was praying by her side,
the doctor pulled the plug.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.009
Remarkably, hours after
the plug was pulled,

09:38.011 --> 09:40.378
Chelsea remained alive.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.547
The nurse at the station
glanced at the monitor

09:42.549 --> 09:46.284
and noticed a man
standing at her door.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.354
Thinking it was odd, she went
out to see what he wanted

09:49.356 --> 09:52.090
but he was nowhere in sight.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.393
She went back to the
monitor and saw him again.

09:55.395 --> 09:58.196
She was so confused by
this so she called over

09:58.198 --> 10:01.099
other hospital staff
and they confirmed

10:01.101 --> 10:03.902
they saw the same thing.

10:03.904 --> 10:08.073
So amazed by what they had
seen, they indisputably agreed,

10:08.075 --> 10:12.243
what they saw was an angel
that saved Chelsea's life.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.384
While heading home one
evening, Mr. wooton

10:19.386 --> 10:21.519
was involved in a
gruesome accident

10:21.521 --> 10:23.355
that should have taken his life.

10:23.357 --> 10:26.458
Nearby, pastor Michael
clearly witnessed the accident

10:26.460 --> 10:28.526
and ran to help.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.963
He recalls seeing his
SUV starting to roll over

10:31.965 --> 10:35.700
before launching into the
air and slamming into a tree.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.836
He then saw something
propelled out

10:37.838 --> 10:40.505
of the passenger side window.

10:40.507 --> 10:43.308
Michael said, when i
got to where it was,

10:43.310 --> 10:47.912
I was shocked to see a
young man curled in a ball.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.881
The whole time
this was happening,

10:49.883 --> 10:54.085
I was in prayer mode asking
god to protect this person.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.254
After first
responders showed up,

10:56.256 --> 10:58.556
Michael began taking pictures.

10:58.558 --> 11:02.627
To his shock, he saw an
angelic figure watching over

11:02.629 --> 11:06.064
the young man as he
was being treated.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.334
Miraculously, he survived
and he and his family

11:09.336 --> 11:12.003
truly believe it was
his guardian angel

11:12.005 --> 11:13.838
captured in the photo.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.394
If angels exist, do
demons also exist?

11:38.364 --> 11:41.266
Two thirds of all
Americans believe not only

11:41.268 --> 11:45.470
that angels and demons exist
but also that they are active

11:45.472 --> 11:45.470
in the world.

11:47.973 --> 11:51.076
Skeptics are dumbfounded
by such archaic nonsense.

11:51.078 --> 11:55.313
To believe in non-physical
beings, souls or spirits

11:55.315 --> 11:58.850
without bodies, in today's
world may seem delusional

11:58.852 --> 12:02.120
but there are serious
scholars who take angels

12:02.122 --> 12:03.855
and demons seriously.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.624
Why?

12:06.626 --> 12:09.694
Certainly non-physical
beings would challenge

12:09.696 --> 12:14.199
the scientific overview of
only the physical is real.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.368
Certainly, angels and demons
in one form or another

12:17.370 --> 12:20.205
populate most of the
world's religions.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.441
But, do angels and
demons really exist?

12:24.844 --> 12:27.946
Speaking in a religious sense,
demons are usually depicted

12:27.948 --> 12:29.447
as agents of evil.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.284
They're supernatural beings
that come from the spirit realm,

12:33.286 --> 12:36.955
forms of darkness that
lurk in the shadows.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.391
Some say they're fallen
angels, banished forever

12:40.393 --> 12:41.826
from god's light.

12:43.295 --> 12:47.298
These are demons
in the traditional
judeo-Christian model

12:47.300 --> 12:50.535
and there are plenty of alleged
accounts of such creatures

12:50.537 --> 12:52.737
throughout history.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.206
Sometimes they are
said to haunt homes,

12:55.208 --> 12:58.610
intending suffering for the
people who reside there.

12:58.612 --> 13:02.547
Other times they may
actually possess a person.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.417
A terrified mother claims
she watched in horror

13:06.419 --> 13:09.954
as her demon possessed
nine year old son

13:09.956 --> 13:13.925
walked backwards up
a wall and ceiling.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.294
Her claims would
be easy to dismiss

13:16.296 --> 13:19.464
if a child's service
caseworker and a nurse

13:19.466 --> 13:22.801
were reportedly there
to witness it all.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.338
Latoya ammons claims all
three of her children

13:27.340 --> 13:31.276
showed signs of being
possessed, including evil smiles

13:31.278 --> 13:33.444
and strangely deep voices.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.284
The Indianapolis star
reports the mother says

13:39.286 --> 13:43.254
she was witnessing her 12
year old daughter levitating

13:43.256 --> 13:46.057
in their Gary, Indiana home.

13:46.059 --> 13:49.060
Strangely enough, the
scary sounding incident

13:49.062 --> 13:52.030
is outlined in
official documents.

13:52.032 --> 13:55.266
Further, Gary police
captain, Charles Austin

13:55.268 --> 13:57.902
told the star that
he is a believer

13:57.904 --> 14:00.238
after making several
visits to the home

14:00.240 --> 14:02.841
and interviewing witnesses.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.543
He first thought the family
was making stories up

14:05.545 --> 14:08.379
as part of a get
rich quick scheme.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.915
Ammons home was exorcised
by a catholic priest

14:10.917 --> 14:14.552
in a number of ceremonies that
were reportedly authorized

14:14.554 --> 14:16.487
by the diocese of Gary.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.591
The story apparently
became so believable

14:19.593 --> 14:22.160
that officers with
the police department

14:22.162 --> 14:24.896
said they were too scared
to stay at the house

14:24.898 --> 14:28.032
and some city officials
wouldn't even step foot

14:28.034 --> 14:29.367
on the property.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.004
The 32 year old mother
says the spirits

14:33.006 --> 14:35.673
that haunted her family's
house were only vanquished

14:35.675 --> 14:39.844
after she moved away and
underwent several exorcisms.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.281
The unbelievable story
has come to light

14:43.283 --> 14:46.885
after the Indianapolis star
obtained hundreds of pages

14:46.887 --> 14:51.122
of official documents
related to the case.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.359
William friedkin sent
theater goers running

14:54.361 --> 14:56.928
for their rosaries
with his 1973 classic

14:56.930 --> 15:00.698
about a little girl possessed
by a sadistic spirit.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.534
The exorcist is
fiction of course,

15:03.536 --> 15:05.703
but the film's
terror is based on

15:05.705 --> 15:10.041
an actual demonic happening
that plagued a 14 year old boy

15:10.043 --> 15:11.876
named Robbie mannheim.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.180
Dubbed Roland Doe at the
time to protect his privacy,

15:16.182 --> 15:20.218
Roland reportedly became
possessed by a malevolent entity

15:20.220 --> 15:23.588
in cottage city, Maryland
in the late 1940's

15:23.590 --> 15:26.090
after trying to
contact his late aunt

15:26.092 --> 15:28.927
with the help of a ouija board.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.429
Once under the influence,
the boy levitated

15:31.431 --> 15:33.264
and spoke in tongues.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.199
Priests were summoned.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.469
After more than 30 rituals
and a move to Missouri,

15:38.471 --> 15:42.874
Doe was finally relieved of
his otherworldly visitors.

15:42.876 --> 15:46.044
He eventually returned
to normal life.

15:47.579 --> 15:50.248
The smurl family case
represents one of the most

15:50.250 --> 15:54.385
highly publicized and
scrutinized exorcism
cases to date.

15:55.754 --> 15:59.724
In 1974, Jack and Janet smurl
says a malevolent presence

16:01.026 --> 16:05.163
possessed their west
pittston, Pennsylvania home,

16:05.165 --> 16:08.232
emitting foul smelling odors.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.969
It also threw the family
dog against the wall,

16:10.971 --> 16:13.504
pushed the smurl
children down the stairs

16:13.506 --> 16:17.875
and sexually and
physically assaulted Jack.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.677
Their story caught the attention

16:19.679 --> 16:22.747
of paranormal investigators,
ed and Lorraine Warren,

16:22.749 --> 16:26.884
who deemed the house disturbed
by a very powerful demon.

16:28.687 --> 16:33.057
While exorcisms were
performed, none seemed to work.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.460
Janet claimed the demon
moved through the walls

16:35.462 --> 16:39.464
of her double block home
during such procedures.

16:40.833 --> 16:45.103
In 1986, after several
holy blessings and prayers

16:45.105 --> 16:48.406
on the part of the smurls,
the forces finally subsided.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.943
Although Janet would still
allege spirit encounters

16:51.945 --> 16:52.777
by 1987.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.516
Michael and Christine Taylor
were a religious couple

16:58.518 --> 17:02.520
from the quiet,
English town of ossett.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.324
In 1974, Christine accused her
husband of having an affair

17:06.326 --> 17:09.193
with the leader of
their prayer group.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.362
The accusation enraged Michael.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.499
He yelled obscenities
and acted erratic.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.435
When his behavior
intensified, angelic priests

17:17.436 --> 17:21.172
decided to purge the
man of his demons.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.241
The exorcism lasted
all night long,

17:23.242 --> 17:25.542
exhausting the priests.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.744
While they claimed
to have freed Michael

17:27.747 --> 17:30.415
from more than 40 demons,
they also believed

17:30.417 --> 17:34.052
that some forces
remained within him.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.686
Perhaps they were right.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.990
Soon after the exorcism was
over, Michael returned home

17:38.992 --> 17:43.061
and murdered his wife and
poodle then roamed the streets

17:43.063 --> 17:46.230
soaked in blood until
he was arrested.

17:48.567 --> 17:52.003
If you've seen the conjuring,
then you're familiar

17:52.005 --> 17:55.373
with the freaky case
of the perron family.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.576
Their real life horror
story began in 1970

17:58.578 --> 18:01.479
when they moved into a
quaint, Rhode Island house

18:01.481 --> 18:04.715
they thought would
be their dream home.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.884
The family encountered
eerie activity

18:06.886 --> 18:09.120
soon after settling in.

18:09.122 --> 18:12.356
They heard strange sounds,
were pulled from their beds

18:12.358 --> 18:15.093
at night and witnessed
the ghost of a woman

18:15.095 --> 18:19.530
who hanged herself from
the bedroom ceiling.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.999
Carolyn received the
harshest treatment.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.569
The mother was poked and
prodded by what she described

18:24.571 --> 18:25.570
as a needle.

18:27.005 --> 18:30.942
When the family still wouldn't
leave, Carolyn was possessed.

18:32.344 --> 18:36.747
Distraught, the parents
contacted paranormal
investigators,

18:36.749 --> 18:40.051
ed and Lorraine Warren,
who claimed to uncover

18:40.053 --> 18:43.020
the home's sinister secrets.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.656
The property had reportedly
seen its fair share

18:45.658 --> 18:49.193
of crimes and suicides,
including a supposed witch

18:49.195 --> 18:52.663
who had sacrificed her
child to the devil.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.400
While spiritual
cleansing was performed,

18:56.402 --> 18:59.237
they did little to
curb the activity.

18:59.239 --> 19:03.741
In 1980, the family sold the
house and fled to Georgia.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.511
The evil reportedly followed
the perrons southward,

19:06.513 --> 19:09.947
though it was less severe
than what they had encountered

19:09.949 --> 19:11.249
in Rhode Island.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.957
Demonic possession
continues to this day

19:19.959 --> 19:23.628
with reports yearly of
satanic visitations.

19:23.630 --> 19:27.498
Many also believe
that ufo alien reports

19:27.500 --> 19:31.669
are actually demons roaming
the earth and in the skies.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.706
The aliens of our
time match the demons

19:35.708 --> 19:38.776
and fallen angels
mentioned in the Bible

19:38.778 --> 19:40.912
in terms of their behavior.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.581
Like the Bible predicts,
aliens never affirmed

19:43.583 --> 19:45.149
the deity of Christ.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.352
Nor do they claim
to come in his name.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.988
Aliens change their
stories to delude man

19:50.990 --> 19:53.457
into believing their lies.

19:53.459 --> 19:57.195
One example of this is that
before man had ever been

19:57.197 --> 19:59.931
to outer space or
sent satellites there,

19:59.933 --> 20:03.000
aliens would claim
to be from planets

20:03.002 --> 20:05.836
such as Venus in
our solar system.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.240
As time went on and man
learned more about our planets,

20:09.242 --> 20:13.344
we realized that no one could
live on a planet like Venus

20:13.346 --> 20:16.514
so aliens changed their story.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.016
Now they claim to be
from other star systems

20:19.018 --> 20:23.187
and star clusters such as
Andromeda and the pleiades.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.497
Though aliens are
said to be advanced,

20:33.499 --> 20:36.734
it seems they need
us for their survival

20:36.736 --> 20:41.038
just as fallen angels need
human beings to prey on.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.341
There are various
accounts of aliens

20:43.343 --> 20:47.011
taking tissue samples
from humans, probing them,

20:47.013 --> 20:49.313
or impregnating women.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.350
This is the origin of the
entities known as incubus

20:52.352 --> 20:53.451
and succubus.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.989
It is said that alien
abductions are stopped

20:57.991 --> 21:00.491
by invoking the name of Jesus.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.562
Aliens bring ideas to
earth that will help man

21:04.564 --> 21:08.566
unite worldwide for a
new era of consciousness.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.369
This uniting prepares
the way for their leader,

21:11.371 --> 21:15.673
who is possibly the
antichrist by making mankind

21:15.675 --> 21:19.844
forget their religion and
loyalty to their country.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.749
Aliens often contact
new agers and occultists

21:24.751 --> 21:26.951
as opposed to christians.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.220
This is not always
the case since people

21:29.222 --> 21:33.858
from all walks of life have
been contacted by aliens.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.361
However, these space brothers
are not too interested

21:37.363 --> 21:39.797
in contacting christians.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.400
Perhaps because christians
will be able to see through

21:42.402 --> 21:46.570
aliens disguise and know them
for what they are, demons.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.712
Aliens are not opposed to
being worshiped by humans.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.948
They also deny their creator,
god, claiming instead

21:57.950 --> 22:00.451
that they are creators.

22:00.453 --> 22:04.155
This serves to draw
man away from god.

22:04.157 --> 22:08.326
Aliens often emit horrible
odors such as sulfur.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.128
Some call this smell
the stench of hell

22:11.130 --> 22:14.865
since it is a sign
of the eternal fire.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.002
Aliens give man technology
but these advancements

22:18.004 --> 22:20.604
are usually destructive.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.040
There are secret projects
that many governments

22:23.042 --> 22:25.876
have in their budget which
are usually for creating

22:25.878 --> 22:28.279
new weapons of war.

22:28.281 --> 22:30.681
Much of the technology
for such weaponry

22:30.683 --> 22:34.018
is said to come from
extra terrestrials.

22:35.454 --> 22:39.790
Why don't aliens ever give
us life saving technology?

23:05.150 --> 23:08.419
Angels and demons not only
exist in Christian lore.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.422
Many new age religions
also support the idea

23:11.424 --> 23:13.924
that angels watch over people.

23:15.327 --> 23:18.729
New agers believe they can
contact angels directly

23:18.731 --> 23:21.265
via channeling or spiritism.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.667
One representative,
new age channeler

23:23.669 --> 23:26.604
offers clients angel listenings.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.173
A typical listening
lasts somewhere

23:29.175 --> 23:31.442
between 20 and 30 minutes
and is really nothing more

23:31.444 --> 23:33.944
than a conversation
between the counselee

23:33.946 --> 23:37.982
and his, her channeler through
whom the counselee's angel

23:37.984 --> 23:39.884
is supposedly speaking.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.554
After going into a trance,
the channeler writes down

23:43.556 --> 23:46.424
everything the angel
relays to him or her

23:46.426 --> 23:48.459
using a pencil and pad.

23:48.461 --> 23:51.429
The counselee never actually
hears the angel speaking

23:51.431 --> 23:54.732
though some have claimed
to see a glow of light

23:54.734 --> 23:57.635
or to sense a
presence in the room.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.307
Meditation and visualization,
both used to induce

24:03.309 --> 24:06.143
an altered state of
consciousness, are popular means

24:06.145 --> 24:08.145
of making angel contact.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.248
As we practice
withdrawing our attention

24:11.250 --> 24:14.552
from the physical world and
focusing it on the spiritual,

24:14.554 --> 24:18.722
our perception becomes less
limited to materiality.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.393
The non-physical realm
becomes more real to us

24:22.395 --> 24:25.596
and we develop the mental
habit of attentiveness to it.

24:25.598 --> 24:29.500
The tendency of material
concerns interferes

24:29.502 --> 24:33.671
with our receptivity
to the angelic realm.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.973
Many who meditate
on a regular basis

24:35.975 --> 24:40.144
claim to have made contact
with inner guides and angels.

24:42.681 --> 24:45.783
Assuming one is successful
in using one of these methods

24:45.785 --> 24:49.954
to make angelic contact, what
form might that contact take?

24:51.323 --> 24:54.391
New agers tell us angels
can appear as animals

24:54.393 --> 24:58.462
and humans, male or
female, visions or voices,

24:58.464 --> 25:00.631
and with wings or without.

25:01.766 --> 25:04.602
They can take the form
of nudgings, intuition,

25:04.604 --> 25:06.237
or coincidence.

25:06.239 --> 25:07.972
They can appear as
light on the water

25:07.974 --> 25:10.941
or in clouds and rainbows.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.344
It's also possible for
an angel's appearance

25:13.346 --> 25:16.313
to be disguised in
everyday events.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.649
You're therefore
urged to pay attention

25:18.651 --> 25:21.285
to the subtleties in life.

25:21.287 --> 25:24.855
For example, a child may
spontaneously blurt out

25:24.857 --> 25:28.392
a statement for which
only you know the meaning.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.828
While thumbing through a
book, a page may fall open

25:30.830 --> 25:33.464
with a clear message
in the print.

25:33.466 --> 25:36.700
Headlines in the newspaper
taken out of context

25:36.702 --> 25:38.969
might contain your message.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.676
New agers believe angels
have a mission to help us

25:45.678 --> 25:49.313
grow in wisdom and love, not
just so that we will survive

25:49.315 --> 25:52.683
as a race but so we will
be able grow into what

25:52.685 --> 25:55.185
we were always intended to be,

25:56.321 --> 25:59.290
perfected beings capable
of incredible energies

25:59.292 --> 26:01.859
and immense, transforming love.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.796
These angels seem similar
to what new agers call

26:05.798 --> 26:10.100
ascended masters, formerly
historical persons

26:10.102 --> 26:13.103
including Jesus,
Buddha, and Mohammad

26:13.105 --> 26:16.774
who have allegedly super
evolved and ascended

26:16.776 --> 26:20.144
to a higher plane of existence
from which they now assist

26:20.146 --> 26:22.012
other humans to evolve.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.984
New agers tell us we can make
a declaration to the angels

26:26.986 --> 26:30.621
who will help bring about
what we desire in life.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.591
Making a declaration to
the angels means that

26:33.593 --> 26:38.562
you are openly announcing
what you want known to heaven.

26:38.564 --> 26:41.365
Declaring your goals and
statements of things to come

26:41.367 --> 26:45.436
will establish a plan of
action with the angels.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.871
The angels will
bless the declaration

26:47.873 --> 26:51.942
and add higher inspiration
and aspirations to it.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.479
The new age can be viewed
as a successor movement

26:55.481 --> 26:58.749
to the counter
culture of the 1960's.

26:58.751 --> 27:02.419
As observers of the new age
vision have pointed out,

27:02.421 --> 27:06.256
a significant portion of
new agers are baby boomers.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.193
People who, for several
decades earlier,

27:09.195 --> 27:11.428
were probably
participating at some level

27:11.430 --> 27:14.932
in the phenomenon known
as the counter culture.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.901
And, as the counter culture
faded away in the early 70's,

27:17.903 --> 27:21.005
many former hippies found
themselves embarking

27:21.007 --> 27:24.375
on a spiritual question
that in many cases

27:24.377 --> 27:28.145
departed from the
judeo-Christian mainstream.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.782
Attracted to the idea
of guardians and angels,

27:31.784 --> 27:34.952
they became more aware
and thus angels are seen

27:34.954 --> 27:36.453
more frequently now.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.223
However, conservative
christians believed

27:39.225 --> 27:42.726
the new age movement
is the most deceptive

27:42.728 --> 27:45.963
and damaging philosophy
around today.

27:45.965 --> 27:49.199
It is entwined not only in
witchcraft and satanism,

27:49.201 --> 27:52.269
it is prevalent in all
denominations of what the world

27:52.271 --> 27:54.304
calls christianity.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.473
The belief system is deeply
rooted in eastern mysticism

27:56.475 --> 27:57.741
and the occult.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.779
Followers are told to awaken
their god consciousness

28:01.781 --> 28:04.314
through transcendental
meditation.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.651
Yoga, hypnosis,
visualization, and more.

28:11.056 --> 28:14.091
What most do not understand
is this is the same thing

28:14.093 --> 28:16.627
Satan said in the
garden of Eden to Eve.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.295
You will be as gods.

28:19.597 --> 28:24.101
Angels have always been
involved in bringing revelation

28:24.103 --> 28:25.769
to mankind.

28:25.771 --> 28:29.473
They have also been involved
in bringing false information.

28:29.475 --> 28:33.811
It all depends on which spirit
you have made contact with.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.513
42% of Americans
believe they have been

28:36.515 --> 28:39.983
in contact with
someone who has died

28:39.985 --> 28:44.888
and almost 15% endorsed
the work of spirit mediums.

28:44.890 --> 28:48.559
How can one know if an
angel is good or bad?

28:49.894 --> 28:52.996
Perhaps only the individual
experiencing the angel

28:52.998 --> 28:54.164
can know this.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.464
Despite its highly
eclectic nature,

29:27.466 --> 29:29.533
a number of beliefs
commonly found

29:29.535 --> 29:32.569
within the new age movement
have been identified.

29:32.571 --> 29:36.707
Theologically, the movement
typically adopts a belief

29:36.709 --> 29:39.810
in a holistic form of
divinity which imbues

29:39.812 --> 29:44.715
all of the universe including
human beings themselves.

29:44.717 --> 29:48.485
There's thus a strong emphasis
on the spiritual authority

29:48.487 --> 29:50.053
of the self.

29:50.055 --> 29:53.157
This is accompanied by a
common belief in a wide variety

29:53.159 --> 29:57.227
of semi-divine, non-human
entities such as angels

29:57.229 --> 30:01.498
and masters with who
humans can communicate,

30:01.500 --> 30:05.002
particularly through
the form of channeling.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.671
Typically viewing human
history as being divided

30:07.673 --> 30:10.340
into a series of distinct ages,

30:10.342 --> 30:14.111
a common new age belief is
that whereas once humanity

30:14.113 --> 30:16.914
lived in an age of great
technological advancement

30:16.916 --> 30:20.083
and spiritual wisdom,
it has entered a period

30:20.085 --> 30:24.021
of spiritual degeneracy
which will be remedied

30:24.023 --> 30:27.391
through the establishment
of a coming age of aquarius

30:27.393 --> 30:30.761
from which the
movement gets its name.

30:30.763 --> 30:33.497
There is also a strong
focus on healing,

30:33.499 --> 30:36.900
particularly using forms
of alternative medicine

30:36.902 --> 30:40.070
and an emphasis
on new age science

30:40.072 --> 30:44.608
which seeks to unite
science and spirituality.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.910
A number of mid 20th
century influences

30:46.912 --> 30:50.547
such as the ufo
religions of the 1950's,

30:50.549 --> 30:53.150
the counter culture
of the 1960's,

30:53.152 --> 30:55.485
and the human potential movement

30:55.487 --> 30:59.256
also exerted a strong influence
on the early development

30:59.258 --> 31:01.892
of the new age movement.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.094
Indigenous American
spiritual leaders

31:04.096 --> 31:08.966
such as elders council of
the lakota, Cheyenne, navajo,

31:08.968 --> 31:13.237
creek, hopi, and chippewa
have denounced new age

31:13.239 --> 31:16.306
misappropriation of
their sacred ceremonies

31:16.308 --> 31:18.842
and other intellectual property,

31:18.844 --> 31:22.312
stating that the value of these
instructions and ceremonies

31:22.314 --> 31:26.049
when led by unauthorized
people are questionable,

31:26.051 --> 31:29.686
maybe meaningless, and
hurtful to the individual

31:29.688 --> 31:31.688
carrying false messages.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.993
Traditional leaders
of the lakota, Dakota,

31:35.995 --> 31:39.796
and nakota peoples have
reached consensus to reject

31:39.798 --> 31:44.668
the exploitation of ceremonial
ways by non-Indians.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.603
They see the new age movement

31:46.605 --> 31:48.672
as either not fully
understanding,

31:48.674 --> 31:52.843
deliberately trivializing, or
distorting their way of life

31:52.845 --> 31:57.314
and have declared war on all
such plastic medicine people

31:57.316 --> 32:01.618
who are appropriating
their spiritual ways.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.922
This includes the often
misused appropriation

32:04.924 --> 32:08.525
of spirit animals as
angels and, or demons

32:08.527 --> 32:12.729
and claiming some native
association of these beings

32:12.731 --> 32:15.098
into their religion.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.367
Spirit animals are
said to be messengers

32:17.369 --> 32:20.837
and have the ability to
help you make decisions.

32:20.839 --> 32:25.008
They appear as an animal in a
dream or even in the physical.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.446
The message itself can
be spiritual in nature

32:29.448 --> 32:31.381
or it can be a warning.

32:32.817 --> 32:35.419
The message may deal with
a seemingly mundane aspect

32:35.421 --> 32:38.188
of your life or it
may be a wake up call

32:38.190 --> 32:41.458
for some important
action you must make.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.094
Sometimes the animal
messenger will come during

32:44.096 --> 32:47.497
an unusual event and
make a powerful statement

32:47.499 --> 32:50.834
and others come on
the wind as a whisper.

32:50.836 --> 32:53.437
A messenger guide
can cause you delays

32:53.439 --> 32:56.974
or some unforeseen
help in your life.

32:56.976 --> 33:00.577
They can be both negative
and positive in nature

33:00.579 --> 33:02.713
for they are totally impartial.

33:02.715 --> 33:06.850
When a decision is made to
follow a certain path in life,

33:06.852 --> 33:11.288
the animal guide is there to
serve as a guide along the way.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.591
It represents a path that
may take months or years

33:14.593 --> 33:15.993
to complete.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.395
It can be a friendly,
traveling companion

33:18.397 --> 33:20.130
if the path is right.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.567
If you become lost along the
way, this spirit animal guide

33:23.569 --> 33:26.169
is there to help lead you back.

33:27.538 --> 33:29.906
American Indians call
the process of connecting

33:29.908 --> 33:32.843
with animal guides and
other parts of creation

33:32.845 --> 33:34.911
as being one with nature.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.581
Connecting with
your animal guide

33:37.583 --> 33:39.850
will make you a better person.

33:39.852 --> 33:42.919
You will be healthier,
physically, mentally,
emotionally,

33:42.921 --> 33:44.988
and spiritually.

33:44.990 --> 33:47.324
You will see the world
and all things in it

33:47.326 --> 33:50.527
with more clarity
and understanding.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.530
Natives believe the new
age white man revolution

33:53.532 --> 33:57.067
is highly hijacking
portions of their beliefs

33:57.069 --> 34:01.271
in trying to use them
as spiritual wisdom.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.074
Psychic websites say
that spirit guides

34:04.076 --> 34:07.077
are often attributed
to giving gut feelings

34:07.079 --> 34:09.746
or intuition about
people or situations

34:09.748 --> 34:12.049
and the way to connect
with a spirit guide

34:12.051 --> 34:14.885
is through some
meditation sessions.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.953
This will allow
your body and mind

34:16.955 --> 34:21.091
to become receptive and open
to communication channels.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.928
To a native, this is
pure new age mumbo jumbo.

34:26.697 --> 34:30.467
First, the psychic website
fails to acknowledge

34:30.469 --> 34:33.370
and accept the omnipotence
of god in the process

34:33.371 --> 34:36.572
of creating and empowering
the spirit guide.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.942
Second, they give all
the power to humans

34:38.944 --> 34:41.445
who will invent and
control the spirit

34:41.447 --> 34:45.114
through psychic gut
feelings and intuition.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.150
A true spirit guide
is divine and sacred.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.420
Its power, wisdom, and
actions stem solely

34:50.422 --> 34:53.989
from the holy spirit
of god or the creator.

34:55.592 --> 34:58.628
To believe otherwise is
an exercise in vanity,

34:58.630 --> 35:01.898
narcissism, and
a grievous error.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.468
The error is allowing
oneself to be guided,

35:04.470 --> 35:08.672
not by the spirit of god but
by human flawed supposition

35:08.674 --> 35:12.843
usually spawned by vanity or
other emotional responses.

35:14.212 --> 35:18.482
Purveyors of so-called birth
totems combine native American

35:18.484 --> 35:21.618
belief in animal
spirits with astrology

35:21.620 --> 35:24.087
and assign various
animal spirit guides

35:24.089 --> 35:27.557
to a particular birth
date of the individual.

35:27.559 --> 35:32.062
Animal spirit cards also
assign an animal spirit

35:32.064 --> 35:35.732
to the individual by a
chance shuffle of the cards.

35:35.734 --> 35:38.869
Both of these
practices have no basis

35:38.871 --> 35:42.105
in American Indian
religious beliefs.

35:42.107 --> 35:45.542
Some messages from an
animal spirit guide

35:46.911 --> 35:50.280
may be confusing, if not
impossible to understand,

35:50.282 --> 35:53.884
without considerable
practice and Patience.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.522
Spiritual wisdom from angels
will come when necessary

35:58.524 --> 36:01.791
and when you are
ready for the message.

36:25.816 --> 36:28.385
The four horsemen of the
apocalypse, often seen

36:28.387 --> 36:32.355
as angels or fallen angels,
are described in the last book

36:32.357 --> 36:34.925
of the new testament
of the Bible,

36:34.927 --> 36:36.927
called the book of revelation

36:36.929 --> 36:40.463
of Jesus Christ to
John the apostle.

36:40.465 --> 36:44.201
The chapter tells of a book
or scroll in god's right hand

36:44.203 --> 36:46.836
that is sealed with seven seals.

36:46.838 --> 36:51.775
The lamb of god opens the
first four of the seven seals

36:51.777 --> 36:55.545
which summons four beings
that ride out on white,

36:55.547 --> 36:57.948
red, black, and green horses.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.450
Though theologians
popular culture differ

37:00.452 --> 37:03.987
on the first horsemen, the
four riders are often seen

37:03.989 --> 37:07.424
as symbolizing
conquest or pestilence,

37:07.426 --> 37:10.527
the Christ or the
antichrist, war, famine,

37:10.529 --> 37:12.529
and death, respectively.

37:13.864 --> 37:16.600
The Christian apocalypse vision
is that the four horsemen

37:16.602 --> 37:20.036
are to set a divine
apocalypse upon the world

37:20.038 --> 37:23.206
as harbingers of
the last judgment.

37:23.208 --> 37:26.142
Some christians
interpret the horsemen

37:26.144 --> 37:29.112
as a prophecy of a
future tribulation

37:29.114 --> 37:32.249
during which many on
earth will die as a result

37:32.251 --> 37:34.985
of multiple catastrophes.

37:34.987 --> 37:37.287
The four horsemen are
the first in a series

37:37.289 --> 37:39.222
of sealed judgements.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.124
This is when god
will judge the earth

37:41.126 --> 37:45.295
and has given the world a chance
to repent before they die.

37:46.564 --> 37:49.332
American protestant
Evangelical interpreters

37:49.334 --> 37:52.269
regularly see ways
in which the horsemen

37:52.271 --> 37:56.439
and revelation in general
speak to contemporary events.

37:58.042 --> 38:01.778
Some who believe revelation
applies to modern times

38:01.780 --> 38:04.414
can interpret the horses
based on various ways

38:04.416 --> 38:06.583
their colors are used.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.853
Red, for example, often
represents communism.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.689
The white horse and
rider were the crown

38:12.691 --> 38:15.191
representing catholicism.

38:15.193 --> 38:18.628
Black has been used as
a symbol of capitalism.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.032
While green represents
the rise of islam.

38:23.868 --> 38:26.369
Some equate the four
horsemen with the angels

38:26.371 --> 38:28.238
of the four winds.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.141
They are described as
angels patrolling the earth

38:31.143 --> 38:33.076
and keeping it peaceful.

38:33.078 --> 38:35.745
It may be assumed that
when the tribulation began,

38:35.747 --> 38:40.250
the peace is taken away
so their job is to terrify

38:40.252 --> 38:42.819
the places in which they patrol.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.755
Seven trumpets are
sounded, one at a time,

38:45.757 --> 38:49.292
to cue apocalyptic events
that were seen in the vision

38:49.294 --> 38:53.063
of the revelation of Christ
Jesus by John of patmos

38:53.065 --> 38:58.068
as written in book of
revelation in the new testament.

38:58.070 --> 39:00.737
The seven trumpets are
sounding by seven angels

39:00.739 --> 39:03.807
and the events that follow
are described in detail

39:03.809 --> 39:06.876
from revelation
chapters eight to 11.

39:08.279 --> 39:11.614
According to revelation, the
angels sound these trumpets

39:11.616 --> 39:14.284
after the breaking
of the seventh seal.

39:14.286 --> 39:17.354
These seals secured the
apocalyptic document

39:17.356 --> 39:20.056
that was in the right
hand of he who sits

39:20.058 --> 39:22.058
on the main throne, god.

39:24.762 --> 39:28.198
Upon the first trumpet sound,
hell and fire mixed with blood

39:28.200 --> 39:31.134
is thrown to the earth,
burning of a third of the trees

39:31.136 --> 39:33.970
on the planet and
all green grass.

39:35.639 --> 39:38.074
By the second trumpet
sounding, it cues something

39:38.076 --> 39:41.177
like a great burning mountain
that plunges into the sea

39:41.179 --> 39:45.014
and wipes out a third of
all sea life and ships.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.852
A third of the oceans
will become blood.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.187
By the sound of the third
trumpet, a great star

39:51.189 --> 39:54.491
called wormwood falls
to the earth, poisoning

39:54.493 --> 39:56.960
a third of the planet's
fresh water sources

39:56.962 --> 39:59.095
such as river and Springs.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.565
Man will die from
drinking its bitter taste.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.502
Following this sounding
of the fourth trumpet,

40:05.504 --> 40:08.571
a third of the light that
shines from the sun, moon,

40:08.573 --> 40:11.641
and stars becomes dark
with these celestial bodies

40:11.643 --> 40:13.476
being struck.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.413
This catastrophe causes
complete darkness for a third

40:16.415 --> 40:21.317
of the day, during the day
and even through night hours.

40:21.319 --> 40:25.488
The fifth trumpet sound
is the first woe of three.

40:26.791 --> 40:30.193
Before this trumpet sounds,
an angel, translated

40:30.195 --> 40:34.030
as an eagle in some versions,
appears flying in mid heaven

40:34.032 --> 40:38.401
and warns, woe, woe, woe, to
those who dwell on the earth

40:38.403 --> 40:41.304
because of the remaining
blasts of the trumpet

40:41.306 --> 40:45.708
of the three angels who
were about to sound.

40:45.710 --> 40:49.579
The fifth trumpet prompts
a personified star

40:49.581 --> 40:51.781
to fall from heaven.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.751
This star is given the
key to the bottomless pit.

40:54.753 --> 40:57.687
After opening it, the
smoke that rises out

40:57.689 --> 41:00.990
darkens the air and
blocks the sunlight.

41:00.992 --> 41:05.161
Then, from out of the smoke,
the locusts are unleashed.

41:06.363 --> 41:08.798
Five months after the
fifth trumpet blasts,

41:08.800 --> 41:10.867
the sixth one sounds.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.570
This is the second
woe where four angels

41:13.572 --> 41:17.474
are released from their binds
to the great river euphrates.

41:17.476 --> 41:21.878
They command a brute force
of 200 million mounted troops

41:21.880 --> 41:26.416
whose horses dissipate plague
from out of their mouths.

41:26.418 --> 41:30.420
Most notably, fire,
smoke, and brimstone.

41:30.422 --> 41:33.623
They are responsible for the
deaths of a third of mankind

41:33.625 --> 41:36.459
who are stricken by the
plague that emanates

41:36.461 --> 41:37.961
from these armies.

41:39.697 --> 41:43.566
The sound of the seventh
trumpet signals the third woe.

41:43.568 --> 41:47.203
The final trumpet sound
and the final woe.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.973
Loud voices in heaven
proclaim Christ

41:49.975 --> 41:54.577
as ruler forever and ever
under the kingdom of our lord.

41:54.579 --> 41:57.247
Thanks is given to god
the almighty and prays

41:57.249 --> 42:00.016
for the wrath that came,
the dead who were judged,

42:00.018 --> 42:03.186
and the bond servants rewarded.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.688
The temple of god in
heaven then opened

42:05.690 --> 42:08.658
and the arch of the covenant
appeared in his temple.

42:08.660 --> 42:12.061
Then, lightning and
peals of thunder occur

42:12.063 --> 42:16.165
followed by an earthquake
and a great hell storm.

42:17.501 --> 42:21.704
Apparently, angels can be
messengers of both good and doom

42:21.706 --> 42:26.209
unlike their demon counterparts
who bring only illness,

42:26.211 --> 42:27.510
fear, and death.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.298
Everyday things that we
cannot explain happen.

42:48.300 --> 42:53.570
When people are cured from
a terminally ill diagnosis,

42:53.572 --> 42:56.573
survive near death
experiences, or triumph

42:56.575 --> 42:59.609
through insurmountable
circumstances,

42:59.611 --> 43:02.779
angels are the only
explanation that we can derive.

43:02.781 --> 43:06.950
As human beings, we crave
an answer for everything.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.387
We do not accept the shear
ideas of things happening

43:11.389 --> 43:12.922
just because.

43:12.924 --> 43:16.593
Instead, the research,
theorize, and brainstorm

43:16.595 --> 43:19.929
ways the unexplainable
can be explained.

43:21.298 --> 43:24.400
Angels are the answer to
the unexplainable blessings

43:24.402 --> 43:26.603
we experience in life.

43:26.605 --> 43:29.005
The messengers of god
are watching over us

43:29.007 --> 43:31.774
and are performing
miracles that in many cases

43:31.776 --> 43:35.178
save lives or renew
hope in the hopeless.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.550
A near death experience
is a personal experience

43:40.552 --> 43:44.187
associated with death
or impending death,

43:44.189 --> 43:47.190
encompassing multiple
possible sensations,

43:47.192 --> 43:50.393
including detachment
from the body,

43:50.395 --> 43:54.263
feelings of levitation,
total Serenity, security,

43:54.265 --> 43:57.934
warmth, the experience
of absolute dissolution,

43:57.936 --> 44:00.269
and the presence of a light.

44:02.006 --> 44:04.173
Researchers have identified
the common elements

44:04.175 --> 44:07.777
that define near
death experiences.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.912
The general features
of the experience

44:09.914 --> 44:14.217
include impressions of being
outside one's physical body,

44:14.219 --> 44:18.521
visions of deceased relatives,
and religious figures,

44:18.523 --> 44:21.357
angels and transcendence of ego

44:21.359 --> 44:24.127
and spatial,
temporal boundaries.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.929
Many common elements
have been reported

44:26.931 --> 44:29.899
although the person's
interpretation of these events

44:29.901 --> 44:33.670
often corresponds to the
cultural, philosophical,

44:33.672 --> 44:38.374
or religious beliefs of
the person experiencing it.

44:38.376 --> 44:41.144
Individuals report
encountering people

44:41.146 --> 44:42.879
which are generally identified

44:42.881 --> 44:46.416
according to the person's
individual faith.

44:46.418 --> 44:50.019
For instance, in the usa
where 46% of the population

44:50.021 --> 44:54.090
believes in guardian angels,
they will often be identified

44:54.092 --> 44:56.659
as angels or the deceased love.

44:58.162 --> 45:01.030
While hindus will often
identify them as messengers

45:01.032 --> 45:02.699
of the god of death.

45:04.301 --> 45:08.304
Reports include a
tunnel experience or
entering a darkness,

45:08.306 --> 45:11.607
a sense of moving up
or through a passageway

45:11.609 --> 45:14.577
or staircase, a rapid
movement towards

45:14.579 --> 45:17.747
and or sudden immersion
in a powerful light

45:17.749 --> 45:21.918
or a beam of light which
communicates with the person.

45:23.454 --> 45:26.222
An intense feeling
of unconditional
love and acceptance

45:26.224 --> 45:27.457
is experienced.

45:28.759 --> 45:31.627
Encountering beings of
light, being dressed in white

45:31.629 --> 45:32.862
or similar.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.964
Also the possibility
of being reunited

45:34.966 --> 45:39.102
with deceased loved ones
plus receiving a life review,

45:39.104 --> 45:42.638
commonly referred to as
seeing one's life flash

45:42.640 --> 45:44.140
before one's eyes.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.647
Some near death
experiences have elements

45:51.649 --> 45:53.649
that bear little resemblance

45:53.651 --> 45:56.052
to the typical near
death experience.

45:56.054 --> 46:00.723
Anywhere from one percent,
according to a 1982 gallup poll,

46:00.725 --> 46:04.894
to 20% of subjects may have
distressing experiences

46:04.896 --> 46:08.765
and feel terrified or
uneasy as various parts

46:08.767 --> 46:12.001
of the near death
experience occur.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.904
They visit or view dark
and depressing areas

46:14.906 --> 46:18.074
or are accosted by
what seem to be hostile

46:18.076 --> 46:22.211
or oppositional forces or
presences such as demons.

46:24.581 --> 46:28.251
Another argument made by
several near death experience

46:28.253 --> 46:31.220
researchers, such as
parnia and fenwick,

46:31.222 --> 46:34.624
for the transcendental
model is that the occurrence

46:34.626 --> 46:37.493
of anecdotal reports of
patients being able to see

46:37.495 --> 46:40.930
and recall detailed events
occurring during cardiac arrest

46:40.932 --> 46:45.134
that are afterwards
verified by hospital staff

46:45.136 --> 46:50.506
support the argument that such
perception sometimes do occur

46:50.508 --> 46:53.242
during periods of
clinical death.

46:55.112 --> 46:58.214
Near death experience
researcher, Janice minor Holden,

46:58.216 --> 47:01.684
found 107 such anecdotal reports

47:01.686 --> 47:05.588
in the near death experience
literature as of 2009,

47:05.590 --> 47:09.792
out of which approximately
91% were accurate.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.165
Near death experiences
are also associated

47:16.167 --> 47:20.069
with changes in personality
and outlook on life.

47:20.071 --> 47:22.505
Kenneth ream, a
professor of psychology,

47:22.507 --> 47:26.542
has identified a consistent
set of value and belief changes

47:26.544 --> 47:30.680
associated with people who have
had a near death experience.

47:32.082 --> 47:36.085
Among these changes, one
finds a great appreciation

47:36.087 --> 47:40.690
for life, higher self esteem,
greater compassion for others,

47:40.692 --> 47:44.193
less concern for
acquiring material wealth,

47:44.195 --> 47:47.663
a heightened sense of purpose
and self understanding,

47:47.665 --> 47:51.567
a desire to learn,
elevated spirituality,

47:51.569 --> 47:55.838
greater ecological sensitivity
and planetary concern,

47:55.840 --> 47:59.008
and a feeling of
being more intuitive.

48:03.481 --> 48:06.415
Changes may also include
increased physical sensitivity,

48:06.417 --> 48:10.219
diminished tolerance of
light, alcohol and drugs,

48:10.221 --> 48:13.055
a feeling that the
brain has been altered

48:13.057 --> 48:16.859
to encompass more, and a
feeling that one is now using

48:16.861 --> 48:20.263
the whole brain rather
than a small part.

48:22.833 --> 48:25.635
Many individuals who experience
a near death experience

48:25.637 --> 48:29.238
see it as a verification
of the existence

48:29.240 --> 48:32.575
of an after life and some
researchers in the field

48:32.577 --> 48:35.912
of near death studies sees
the near death experience

48:35.914 --> 48:39.582
as evidence that human
consciousness may continue

48:39.584 --> 48:41.317
to exist after death.

48:42.719 --> 48:45.621
The transcendental or
survivalist interpretations

48:45.623 --> 48:49.425
of the near death experience
contends that the experience

48:49.427 --> 48:52.895
is exactly what it appears
to be to the persons

48:52.897 --> 48:54.730
having the experience.

48:58.236 --> 49:00.770
According to this
interpretation, consciousness

49:00.772 --> 49:04.473
can become separated from the
brain under certain conditions

49:04.475 --> 49:07.610
and glimpse this
spiritual angelic realm

49:07.612 --> 49:10.446
to which souls
travel after death.

49:12.182 --> 49:15.551
Perhaps, we can become
angels ourselves.

49:43.880 --> 49:48.517
Is it possible that we can
become angels ourselves?

49:48.519 --> 49:51.954
Can we leave the physical
body and travel about

49:51.956 --> 49:54.390
in a spiritual, angelic body?

49:55.525 --> 49:58.794
Can we visit angelic
realms before we die?

49:59.997 --> 50:03.733
As an alternative to
belief centric labels

50:03.735 --> 50:08.471
such as astral projection,
soul travel, or spirit walking,

50:08.473 --> 50:12.308
out of body experiences can
be induced by brain traumas,

50:12.310 --> 50:16.645
sensory deprivation,
near death experiences,

50:16.647 --> 50:20.683
dissociative and psychedelic
drugs, dehydration,

50:20.685 --> 50:24.153
sleep, and electrical
stimulation of the brain

50:24.155 --> 50:26.022
among others.

50:26.024 --> 50:29.692
It can also be deliberately
induced by some.

50:29.694 --> 50:33.863
One in 10 people have an
out of body experience once,

50:35.198 --> 50:38.701
or more commonly, several
times in their life.

50:41.671 --> 50:45.274
Those experiencing out
of body experiences

50:45.276 --> 50:47.910
sometimes report among
other types of immediate

50:47.912 --> 50:51.947
and spontaneous experience,
a preceding and initiating

50:51.949 --> 50:53.449
lucid dream state.

50:55.018 --> 50:58.120
In many cases, people
who claim to have had

50:58.122 --> 51:01.490
an out of body experience report
being on the verge of sleep

51:01.492 --> 51:05.661
or being already asleep
shortly before the experience.

51:07.097 --> 51:10.733
A large percentage of these
cases refer to situations

51:10.735 --> 51:13.969
where the sleep was
not particularly deep

51:13.971 --> 51:17.106
due to illness, noises in
other rooms, emotional stress,

51:17.108 --> 51:20.876
exhaustion from over working,
frequent reawakening,

51:20.878 --> 51:20.876
and et cetera.

51:23.380 --> 51:25.581
In most of these cases,
subjects perceived themselves

51:25.583 --> 51:27.149
as being awake.

51:27.151 --> 51:31.320
About half of the note a
feeling of sleep paralysis.

51:32.789 --> 51:35.024
Writes within the
fields of parapsychology

51:35.026 --> 51:38.427
and occultism have written
that out of body experiences

51:38.429 --> 51:41.130
are not psychological
and that a soul, spirit,

51:41.132 --> 51:45.501
or subtle body can detach
itself out of the body

51:45.503 --> 51:47.837
and visit distant locations.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.575
Out of body
experiences were known

51:52.577 --> 51:56.679
during the victorian period
in spiritualist literature

51:56.681 --> 51:58.848
as traveling clairvoyance.

52:00.584 --> 52:04.787
In April 1977, a patient from
harbor view medical center,

52:04.789 --> 52:07.857
known as Maria, claimed
to have experienced

52:07.859 --> 52:10.659
an out of body experience.

52:10.661 --> 52:13.028
During her out of
body experience,

52:13.030 --> 52:15.865
she claimed to have
floated outside her body

52:15.867 --> 52:18.067
and outside of the hospital.

52:18.069 --> 52:20.503
Maria would later tell
her social worker,

52:20.505 --> 52:24.140
Kimberly Clark, that during
the out of body experience,

52:24.142 --> 52:26.609
she had observed a tennis shoe

52:28.011 --> 52:29.812
on the third floor window
ledge to the north side

52:29.814 --> 52:31.680
of the building.

52:31.682 --> 52:33.749
Clark went to the north
wing of the building

52:33.751 --> 52:35.684
and by looking
out of the window,

52:35.686 --> 52:38.888
she could see a tennis
shoe on one of the ledges.

52:38.890 --> 52:41.924
Clark published the
account in 1985.

52:41.926 --> 52:45.895
The story has since been
used in many paranormal books

52:45.897 --> 52:49.231
as evidence a spirit
can leave the body.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.670
Astral projection is a
paranormal interpretation

52:54.672 --> 52:58.440
of out of body experiences
that assumes the existence

52:58.442 --> 53:01.477
of one or more non-physical
planes of existence

53:01.479 --> 53:05.080
and an associated body
beyond the physical.

53:06.516 --> 53:09.785
Commonly, such planes are
called astral, ethereal,

53:09.787 --> 53:11.387
or spiritual.

53:11.389 --> 53:13.556
Astral projection
is often experienced

53:13.558 --> 53:17.359
as the spirit or astral body
leaving the physical body

53:17.361 --> 53:20.930
to travel in the spirit
world, or astral plane

53:20.932 --> 53:22.431
as an angel would.

53:24.501 --> 53:28.170
This assumes the
existence of a soul

53:28.172 --> 53:30.806
or consciousness
called an astral body

53:30.808 --> 53:32.708
that is separate from
the physical body

53:32.710 --> 53:34.977
and capable of
traveling outside of it

53:34.979 --> 53:37.479
throughout the universe
where it interacts

53:37.481 --> 53:40.082
with other astral
bodies and is capable

53:40.084 --> 53:43.886
of implanting ideas into
other people's minds.

53:48.458 --> 53:51.327
The idea of astral travel
is rooted in esotericism

53:51.329 --> 53:52.494
and occultism.

53:54.164 --> 53:57.266
It was promoted by philosophers
who explored the mystical

53:57.268 --> 54:00.569
and pre-natural origins
of the natural world.

54:00.571 --> 54:03.872
It is sometimes reported
in association with dreams

54:03.874 --> 54:06.575
and forms of meditation.

54:06.577 --> 54:09.445
Some individuals have
reported perceptions

54:09.447 --> 54:12.815
similar to descriptions
of astral projection

54:12.817 --> 54:16.118
that were induced through
various hallucinogenic

54:16.120 --> 54:19.722
and hypnotic means
including self-hypnosis.

54:21.358 --> 54:24.593
There is no scientific
evidence that there is

54:24.595 --> 54:27.363
a consciousness or
soul which is separate

54:27.365 --> 54:30.666
from normal, neural activity
or that one can consciously

54:30.668 --> 54:33.435
leave the body and
make observations.

54:33.437 --> 54:36.171
Claims of scientific
evidence of astral projection

54:36.173 --> 54:38.907
are considered
pseudo-scientific.

54:40.877 --> 54:43.379
Similar concepts of
out of body experiences

54:43.381 --> 54:47.349
appear in various other
religious traditions.

54:47.351 --> 54:49.985
For example, ancient
Egyptian teachings

54:49.987 --> 54:53.422
present the soul, ba,
as having the ability

54:53.424 --> 54:56.992
to hover outside the
physical body in the ka,

54:56.994 --> 54:58.327
our subtle body.

55:01.731 --> 55:04.366
The soul's ability to
leave the body at will

55:04.368 --> 55:07.736
or while sleeping and
visit the various planes

55:07.738 --> 55:11.006
of heaven is also
known as soul travel.

55:12.108 --> 55:14.943
The practice is taught
in surat shabd yoga

55:14.945 --> 55:17.246
where the experience
is achieved mostly

55:17.248 --> 55:21.583
by meditation techniques
and mantra repetition.

55:21.585 --> 55:25.087
All sant mat gurus widely
spoke about this kind

55:25.089 --> 55:28.924
of out of body experience
such as karpil seen.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.596
The religion of eckankar
describes soul travel

55:34.598 --> 55:38.167
broadly as a movement of
the true spiritual self,

55:38.169 --> 55:41.837
or soul, closer to
the heart of god.

55:41.839 --> 55:44.606
While the contemplative
may perceive the experience

55:44.608 --> 55:48.077
as travel, soul itself
is said not to move

55:48.079 --> 55:51.246
but to come into an
agreement with fixed states

55:51.248 --> 55:55.184
and conditions that
already exist in some world

55:55.186 --> 55:56.685
of time and space.

55:58.021 --> 56:00.656
There are cases of
patients having experiences

56:00.658 --> 56:03.525
suggestive of astral projection

56:03.527 --> 56:07.696
from brain stimulation
treatments and
hallucinogenic drugs.

56:10.266 --> 56:13.535
In the Bible, Paul's second
epistle to the corinthians

56:13.537 --> 56:17.106
is more generally agreed to
refer to the astral planes

56:17.108 --> 56:21.543
where he said, I know a
man in Christ 14 years ago.

56:21.545 --> 56:25.481
Whether in the body, I know
not, or out of the body,

56:25.483 --> 56:29.418
I know not, god knows
such as one caught up

56:29.420 --> 56:31.086
in the third heaven.

56:32.756 --> 56:35.891
This passage appears to
confirm out of body travel

56:35.893 --> 56:38.961
as well as other
planes of existence.

56:41.765 --> 56:45.033
According to classical,
medieval and renaissance

56:45.035 --> 56:49.338
hermeticism, neoplatonism,
and later theosophists

56:49.340 --> 56:52.174
and rosicrucian
thought, the astral body

56:52.176 --> 56:56.178
is an intermediate body of
light linking the rational soul

56:56.180 --> 56:59.181
to the physical body
while the astral plane

56:59.183 --> 57:01.917
is an intermediate
world of light

57:01.919 --> 57:04.987
between heaven and earth,
composed of the spheres

57:04.989 --> 57:07.055
of the planets and stars.

57:07.057 --> 57:10.359
These astral spheres
were held to be populated

57:10.361 --> 57:12.961
by angels, demons, and spirits.

57:15.698 --> 57:18.434
Other experiencers
may describe a domain

57:18.436 --> 57:22.838
that has no parallel to
any known physical setting.

57:22.840 --> 57:27.242
Environments may be
populated or unpopulated.

57:27.244 --> 57:30.012
Artificial, natural,
or abstract.

57:30.014 --> 57:32.781
And the experience may
be beautiful, horrific,

57:32.783 --> 57:33.682
or neutral.

57:36.986 --> 57:38.987
A common belief is
that one may access

57:38.989 --> 57:41.657
a compendium of
mystical knowledge

57:41.659 --> 57:44.193
called the akashic records.

57:44.195 --> 57:47.129
In many accounts, the
experiencer correlates

57:47.131 --> 57:49.865
the astral world with
the world of dreams.

57:49.867 --> 57:52.601
Some even report
seeing other dreamers

57:52.603 --> 57:54.870
enacting dream scenarios,

57:54.872 --> 57:57.873
unaware of their
wider environment,

57:57.875 --> 58:01.376
while many report
seeing guides or angels.

58:05.448 --> 58:08.517
The astral environment
may also be divided

58:08.519 --> 58:12.688
into levels or sub-planes but
there are many different views

58:12.690 --> 58:16.258
and various traditions
concerning the overall structure

58:16.260 --> 58:18.026
of the astral planes.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.029
They may include
heavens and hells

58:21.031 --> 58:25.167
and other after death spheres,
transcended environments,

58:25.169 --> 58:28.670
or other less easily
characterized states.

58:30.840 --> 58:34.309
If out of body travel, or
soul travel, does exist

58:34.311 --> 58:36.178
as many have reported,

58:36.180 --> 58:39.848
is it possible that we
ourselves are angels?

59:03.406 --> 59:05.841
Christians believe that
after we're finished on earth

59:05.843 --> 59:09.611
we are laid to rest and are
reunited with our loved ones,

59:09.613 --> 59:10.546
our angels.

59:11.714 --> 59:14.082
If you believe in
heaven then you believe

59:14.084 --> 59:16.919
in the greater powers
that come along with it,

59:16.921 --> 59:18.420
angels and demons.

59:19.856 --> 59:24.126
While we cannot confirm that
it exists, we still believe.

59:24.128 --> 59:27.496
Death cannot be the end
to relationships we have

59:27.498 --> 59:29.565
with the ones we love.

59:29.567 --> 59:32.601
Knowing that heaven exists
and angels live there

59:32.603 --> 59:36.471
waiting for their loved
ones is comforting.

59:36.473 --> 59:39.074
Ultimately, heaven
is more than a place

59:39.076 --> 59:41.910
where god exists because
it is also a place

59:41.912 --> 59:46.014
where our angels are
waiting for us to join them.

59:47.150 --> 59:49.818
Faith is believing
in the unknown,

59:49.820 --> 59:52.688
despite the good and
bad that comes with it.

59:52.690 --> 59:55.257
There is no doubt that
faith has the power

59:55.259 --> 59:58.560
to aid us in persevering
through great challenges

59:58.562 --> 01:00:00.896
and everyday happenings.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:03.732
Angels are part of that faith.

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.767
If you believe in
a higher being,

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.036
then you believe in angels.

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:11.073
No matter what angels are,
they are there to stand

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:14.810
at the forefront and
answer our prayers.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:16.445
When you're praying to god,

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:19.514
you're also praying to the
angels that stand next to him

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:21.850
and serve him as messengers.

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:26.922
Everyday things that we
cannot explain do happen.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:31.827
When people are cured from
a terminally ill diagnosis,

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:35.130
survive near death
experiences or triumph

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:37.332
through insurmountable
circumstances,

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:41.203
angels are the only
explanation that we can derive.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:45.841
As human beings, we crave
an answer for everything.

01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:48.243
Nothing happens just because.

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:52.214
Everything happens for a reason.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:57.052
Angels are the divine guiding
us through life's errors

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:59.021
and happiness.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:02.958
Perhaps making contact and
acknowledging the angels

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.129
that surround us is the
best way to cope with life.

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:13.268
Spiritual awareness is the
key and love is the answer

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.703
beyond all doors.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:18.907
Never be afraid to
explore because angels

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:22.244
are there to guide
and support you.

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:25.914
And perhaps, a single
act of kindness daily

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.817
does indeed mean
we are angels too.
