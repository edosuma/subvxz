01:00.990 --> 01:02.560
Cooper, Theo.

01:02.950 --> 01:04.310
Time to go.

01:06.110 --> 01:07.360
Hey bro,

01:07.790 --> 01:09.790
You got any more of
those smokes?

01:17.290 --> 01:18.810
Quitting anyway.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.160
Muchas gracias.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.800
Public intoxication...

01:30.820 --> 01:32.790
disorderly conduct...

01:32.810 --> 01:34.810
sustained unrest.

01:34.980 --> 01:36.400
Have a nice day.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.190
The board wanted to boot you off.

01:45.210 --> 01:46.940
And I agreed with them.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.660
You can count your lucky
stars it's too late to find someone else.

01:51.790 --> 01:54.600
All the potential in the world, huh?

02:32.060 --> 02:33.740
<i>Many years ago,</i>

02:33.840 --> 02:36.170
<i>the great British explorer,
George Mallory,</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:38.450
<i>who was to die</i>

02:38.470 --> 02:41.950
<i>on Mount Everest, was
asked why did he want to climb it.</i>

02:42.590 --> 02:44.300
<i>He said, "Because it is there."</i>

02:44.510 --> 02:47.170
<i>Well, space is there,
and we're going to climb it.</i>

02:47.970 --> 02:49.940
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

02:50.680 --> 02:52.810
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

02:58.730 --> 03:03.110
<i>We choose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other things</i>

03:03.130 --> 03:06.800
<i>not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>

03:07.180 --> 03:12.270
<i>Because that goal will
serve to organize and measure the best</i>

03:12.290 --> 03:14.290
<i>of our energies and skills.</i>

03:30.940 --> 03:32.800
We've grown used
to the idea of space

03:33.310 --> 03:36.130
<i>and perhaps we forget
that we've only just begun.</i>

03:36.860 --> 03:38.630
<i>it's hard to dazzle us.</i>

03:38.660 --> 03:40.900
<i>but for twenty-five years
the United States space</i>

03:40.930 --> 03:43.420
<i>program has been doing just that.</i>

03:46.910 --> 03:49.970
<i>And slipped the surly
bounds of earth</i>

03:50.710 --> 03:52.940
<i>to touch the face of God.</i>

04:17.519 --> 04:20.390
We'll start by sending
astronauts to an asteroid

04:20.410 --> 04:22.230
<i>for the first time in history.</i>

04:24.830 --> 04:26.650
<i>By the mid 2030s,</i>

04:26.670 --> 04:29.050
<i>I believe we can
send humans to orbit</i>

04:29.080 --> 04:31.200
<i>Mars and return them
safely to Earth.</i>

04:31.970 --> 04:34.020
<i>And a landing on Mars will follow.</i>

04:34.480 --> 04:38.230
<i>What I hope is that everybody will take
a look at what we are planning.</i>

04:38.260 --> 04:40.370
<i>We will work with a growing array</i>

04:40.400 --> 04:42.700
<i>of private companies
competing to make</i>

04:43.030 --> 04:45.690
<i>getting to space easier
and more affordable.</i>

04:45.970 --> 04:48.320
<i>That's how we'll ensure that
our leadership in space</i>

04:48.340 --> 04:50.320
<i>is even stronger in
this new century</i>

04:50.340 --> 04:52.340
<i>than it was in the last.</i>

04:55.740 --> 04:58.400
At its core, it's a
social experiment

04:58.430 --> 05:02.440
designed to test the psychological
effects of deep space travel.

05:02.460 --> 05:04.100
With Kepler's first actual

05:04.120 --> 05:06.700
manned mission just
a few years away,

05:06.860 --> 05:11.720
we need to know how these four
astronaut hopefuls will react to

05:12.000 --> 05:16.300
unforeseen challenges on board the ship.
You can think of it as a...

05:16.570 --> 05:18.250
an elaborate dress-rehearsal.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.140
Where is this ship you
keep mentioning?

05:20.160 --> 05:21.750
You're sitting on it.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.500
We felt that by placing
them underground,

05:24.520 --> 05:29.440
it would be more realistic and...
well, more inconspicuous.

05:29.470 --> 05:30.630
What are you most
concerned about?

05:30.660 --> 05:33.260
We know that the human mind
can be pretty powerful

05:33.290 --> 05:35.050
when left to its own devices.

05:35.070 --> 05:37.430
And in an environment like this
reality can

05:37.450 --> 05:38.840
become subjective in a hurry.

05:38.870 --> 05:41.760
Dr.McTier is nothing
if not honest.

05:42.110 --> 05:44.170
And...and brave.
- We're all a little crazy to sign

05:44.200 --> 05:45.550
up for a mission this long, but

05:45.570 --> 05:48.670
it's also the quickest way to get
our ticket punched on an actual mission.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.590
And Mr. Dvorak here,
in addition to his regular duties,

05:52.620 --> 05:57.030
has been tasked with creating
a weekly web video

05:57.050 --> 05:59.640
to keep all of you
apprised on the outside.

05:59.780 --> 06:02.620
Can you tell us about some of the
experiments you have planned?

06:02.650 --> 06:04.710
I have a relatively
exciting desk analysis

06:04.730 --> 06:07.040
planned for the
duration of the trip.

06:07.800 --> 06:12.240
The...the amount on my PC will
blow your mind.

06:12.260 --> 06:15.760
What about you, captain?
You've been awfully quiet.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.790
Well, I'm...my girlfriend
just broke up with me

06:19.810 --> 06:21.430
and I'm extremely hung over

06:21.450 --> 06:24.180
from a four day bender, so
I...I don't really know

06:24.200 --> 06:26.770
how much I can contribute
to this conversation.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.400
We also

06:30.650 --> 06:34.260
uh...have planned to throw a
few curve balls at our astronauts

06:35.030 --> 06:36.320
and see how they react to those.

06:36.630 --> 06:40.850
Let's just say that
anything can happen.

06:50.090 --> 06:52.090
Remember our deal.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.410
Well...

07:01.790 --> 07:03.340
You take care of my baby.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.370
Alright?
- Yes, sir.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.370
A big part of me
wishes I was going with you.

07:11.810 --> 07:13.810
If any of you quits early,

07:14.160 --> 07:16.440
I'll 86 your career in a nanosecond.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.520
I'm not kidding.

07:20.310 --> 07:21.910
Alright!

07:34.570 --> 07:36.950
Godspeed. See you at launch.

08:38.130 --> 08:39.860
You know this mission's
fake, right?

08:40.070 --> 08:42.350
I don't care.  It's so cool.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.980
Alright, what's the 411 on the
power situation?

08:48.020 --> 08:52.620
Solar ray looks A-okay, we've got
22% efficiency with 4000 watt megs.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.820
- And the O2?
- Good, 21%.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.840
Alrighty, let's get
this party started.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.670
Current weather conditions look good,

08:59.690 --> 09:01.790
Everyone is secure and accounted for?
- Yes sir.

09:01.820 --> 09:03.820
- Life systems?
- Good to go.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.960
- Medical?
- Go.

09:04.990 --> 09:06.360
- Engineering?
- Go!

09:06.390 --> 09:07.650
Roger that.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.820
- You can pre-start.
- Well, I got BPUs.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.470
- You are on internal power. Over.
- Yes, sir.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.120
T minus 10...9...

09:15.140 --> 09:17.370
8...7...

09:17.400 --> 09:19.070
6...5...

09:19.100 --> 09:22.160
4... 3...

09:22.180 --> 09:24.770
2...1...

09:24.940 --> 09:25.940
Ignition.

09:26.410 --> 09:27.580
And liftoff!

09:28.380 --> 09:30.040
All engines look good.

09:30.800 --> 09:31.870
Getting roaming...

09:31.890 --> 09:34.290
Altitude is right on mark.

09:34.310 --> 09:35.520
All systems look good.

09:35.550 --> 09:39.530
Velocity 32,000 feet per second
down range 1800 miles.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.600
<i>Initiate separation</i>

09:42.650 --> 09:45.240
<i>Warning! Separation failure</i>

09:45.260 --> 09:47.570
<i>Payload  is still attached.</i>

09:48.610 --> 09:52.160
It says the detach button.
It must not have unhinged itself.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.940
Maybe it's stuck.
- Failure to drop it will

09:53.970 --> 09:56.130
result in complete disintegration

09:58.610 --> 09:59.810
Theo!

10:01.940 --> 10:02.950
Yeah.  Well,

10:02.970 --> 10:06.590
um...Bug, what's our speed?

10:06.610 --> 10:08.020
Mach one-nine.

10:09.420 --> 10:13.470
What if we adjust our pinch 2 degrees
to expose the shroud to the windstream?

10:13.560 --> 10:17.060
Are you sure? I...I don't know
if that's gonna be enough to shake it off.

10:17.090 --> 10:19.190
Or will it slow our velocity
down to the point

10:19.220 --> 10:21.380
where we all die a
miserable death?

10:22.300 --> 10:25.580
Mission control, permission to adjust
Star One pitch 2 degrees.

10:25.770 --> 10:27.450
Permission granted.

10:29.770 --> 10:31.160
Adjusting pitch.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.550
<i>Separation achieved.</i>

10:46.010 --> 10:47.340
Crisis averted.

10:48.880 --> 10:54.350
Exiting Earth's atmosphere in 3...2...1..

10:55.910 --> 10:57.310
Congratulations.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.140
You passed your first test.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.750
Go ahead, get yourselves situated
in your bunks.

11:01.770 --> 11:04.620
You'll find that I have left
each of you with a little parting gift.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.580
I'll talk to you tomorrow
at 10:00 hours.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.230
Mission control out.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.460
It's so clinical.

11:31.950 --> 11:33.410
I guess we're home.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.740
Thank you, Walter!

12:56.570 --> 12:58.270
Are you doing okay?

12:58.510 --> 12:59.780
Yeah, fine.

13:00.390 --> 13:04.010
When Nikki and I split up,
I used to pour cough syrup on my cereal.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.790
Bug, I'm fine.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.620
Thanks.

13:16.930 --> 13:17.930
Hey.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.110
Come on in.  Have a seat.

13:27.410 --> 13:30.090
So, I'm just going to be
asking you a few questions

13:30.120 --> 13:32.120
to establish a mental health base-line.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.580
Very technical.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.170
Just doing my job.
Then you can be out of here.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.330
"In the past two
weeks, how many hours

13:39.350 --> 13:41.070
of sleep have you been
getting a night?"

13:42.820 --> 13:43.820
Not enough.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.150
"On a scale of one to ten,
where would you

13:45.180 --> 13:47.610
place your ability to fulfill
mission duties?"

13:48.610 --> 13:49.630
Ten.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.350
"What is your current mood?"

13:53.420 --> 13:54.370
Tired...

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
and a little hung over.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.080
Tired and hung over aren't
moods, I need

13:59.110 --> 14:03.390
something like happy,
sad, depressed...angry.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.130
Depressed.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.060
Angry...

14:09.590 --> 14:11.080
and confused.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.520
"Are there any particular reasons why
you might be feeling this way?"

14:16.160 --> 14:18.420
Please, don't play games with me.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.360
Theo, I'm sorry. these are only
the questions on the list.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.170
The woman I wanted to marry

14:24.640 --> 14:26.590
decided she wasn't ready,

14:28.550 --> 14:30.550
and called it quits.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.030
It's more complicated than that.

14:36.430 --> 14:37.350
Enlighten me.

14:37.370 --> 14:40.110
Yeah, Theo, not everything
is as easy as you want it to be.

14:40.930 --> 14:42.840
What does that mean? What, what?

14:43.170 --> 14:45.170
It means we're done here, Thank you.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.050
Yes.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.030
And here we have our cook

14:59.060 --> 15:01.630
who's preparing the ship's
very first meal.

15:01.660 --> 15:02.990
Bug, what is on the menu?

15:03.280 --> 15:04.100
I am not the cook,

15:04.130 --> 15:07.640
we take turns and this
is re-hydrated mushrooms.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.980
Yikes.

15:10.690 --> 15:13.390
Let's hope we make it through the night.

15:14.470 --> 15:16.770
Alright, is this all we have?
Because I'm starving.

15:17.030 --> 15:19.720
Kitchen is closed after this, sir.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.770
What's with the bear?

15:24.680 --> 15:26.070
My good-luck charm.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.560
How old are you?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.090
Old enough to know
when someone's being an ass.

15:34.620 --> 15:35.700
What the hell is that?

15:36.390 --> 15:37.810
Immunization boosters.

15:38.540 --> 15:39.990
Wait a second.
No, No. No.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.510
Nobody said anything
about getting shots.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.660
Uh, yeah they did, during training.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.840
When you're in close quarters, makes
you more susceptible to viruses,

15:46.860 --> 15:49.750
any long term illness could
jeopardize the mission.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.180
And who knows what
you brought on with you.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.810
I remember everything...always

15:55.840 --> 15:57.450
and I don't remember that.

15:57.470 --> 15:58.790
Come on, now.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.090
Afraid of a little shot?

16:01.110 --> 16:03.110
No, I am not.  Not at all.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.620
Maybe she'll give you
a lollipop when you're all done.

16:07.340 --> 16:08.350
Arm.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.590
All done.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
How's the water?

16:32.580 --> 16:34.030
Fine. Why?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.200
I... ran our forward
osmosis reclaimer,

16:38.460 --> 16:39.890
before we sat down,

16:40.080 --> 16:43.600
so, it's recycled pee.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.450
I am drinking my own pee?

16:54.590 --> 16:58.640
Well, there is no way to
tell if it's yours specifically.

16:58.670 --> 17:02.360
Oh, okay, and as far as this
uh, soup went, is that

17:02.390 --> 17:04.300
my own shit?
Because it tasted like it.

17:34.650 --> 17:35.890
What's up?

17:35.910 --> 17:38.450
Listen, we're gonna be here for
a long time, so I thought

17:38.470 --> 17:40.470
if you need something--
- No, I'm good.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.020
Just see how you're doing.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.370
- Uh...
- Well if you need anybody,

17:44.400 --> 17:46.170
don't hesitate.
- I won't.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.290
Good night.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.100
Okay, Uh...

18:18.080 --> 18:19.880
We try to get
regular workouts here,

18:20.870 --> 18:23.510
Want to keep our
health up for when we

18:23.720 --> 18:25.530
get ready for actual space travel.

18:26.130 --> 18:29.530
And, so this little gym...

18:30.560 --> 18:31.960
our gym away from home.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.860
Alright...Lets go to sprint.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.970
And allow me to
show you the kitchen

18:48.990 --> 18:53.520
where we have our cook
preparing the ship's first official meal.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.860
Bug, what's on the menu?

18:55.880 --> 18:59.490
I am not the cook, we take turns
and this is re-hydrated mushrooms.

18:59.770 --> 19:03.710
Yikes. Let's hope we make
it through the night.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.290
You know what time it is?

19:26.540 --> 19:29.050
It is time to play
a little game I call

19:29.080 --> 19:31.660
"Emily's perceptional
monumental chronology test

19:31.680 --> 19:33.970
that infers the temporal
sequencing content

19:34.000 --> 19:36.120
and duration of cognitive operations."

19:39.130 --> 19:41.290
Or we can... we
can call it "memory,"

19:41.320 --> 19:42.640
that's another way.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.390
You flip them over
until you find a match.

19:45.410 --> 19:46.940
We're going to play
this once a month

19:46.960 --> 19:49.490
to check progress or lack thereof.

19:50.780 --> 19:51.870
Ready?

19:53.290 --> 19:54.490
Please begin.

20:09.310 --> 20:10.310
Done.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.000
Are we...are we moving?

20:41.250 --> 20:44.130
This...is some simulation.

20:46.140 --> 20:48.410
Uh, uh maybe we're
passing through an asteroid belt.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.960
Unlikely. The only belt
of significance is beyond Mars,

20:50.990 --> 20:53.320
we only have another 60 million
kilometers to go.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.130
Let's check with mission control.

21:05.820 --> 21:07.070
Mission control, please copy.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.980
Walter, do you copy?

21:14.210 --> 21:15.280
Walter, do you copy?

21:16.580 --> 21:17.590
Do you copy?

21:18.370 --> 21:21.880
<i>Warning! Recalibrating solar
energy retention.</i>

21:21.900 --> 21:22.970
Shit!

21:23.040 --> 21:24.960
<i>Warning.</i>
- Look, solar array.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.370
<i>Warning! Recalibrating solar
energy retention.</i>

21:34.000 --> 21:35.450
The batteries are fine,

21:35.470 --> 21:37.400
but we're still getting
a little bit of power from the solar array.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.450
So what's the problem?

21:38.480 --> 21:40.820
I think those bastards ruined
the solar panels.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.070
Is there anything
we can do about it?

21:42.090 --> 21:43.940
This is obviously one of
Walter's curve balls. Right?

21:43.970 --> 21:47.150
So let's just not freak
out and conserve power for a while.

21:47.520 --> 21:48.690
No big deal.

22:23.900 --> 22:24.990
Walter, come in.

22:28.590 --> 22:31.570
Walter, this is Emily, I'm alone
and I need to speak with you.

22:32.790 --> 22:34.240
I need you to answer.

22:35.710 --> 22:37.320
Walter, please come in.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.390
it's Emily, and I need to speak with you.

22:41.950 --> 22:44.280
Walter, please answer.
I need to talk to you.

22:45.830 --> 22:46.730
Hey.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.980
- Jesus...
- How you doing?

22:50.570 --> 22:53.670
Um...still trying to reach
mission control.

22:54.590 --> 22:57.080
This is just part
of the simulation, right?

23:01.070 --> 23:03.280
Yeah. Sure.

23:04.550 --> 23:08.060
It's probably the reason we were left with
enough power to keep the systems running.

23:08.090 --> 23:10.010
- Right?
- Yeah.

23:15.330 --> 23:16.780
Let me get some sleep.

23:20.890 --> 23:24.260
A happy birthday, by the way.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.220
Thanks.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.460
Ah, come on.

23:48.570 --> 23:49.840
You taking this so seriously.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.540
Yeah it's a big deal.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.100
They're investing a lot of
time and money into it.

23:54.130 --> 23:56.130
Yeah, and you're gonna be fine.

23:56.490 --> 23:59.810
I guess I can't do this whole
apathetic thing as well as you do.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.410
What's that supposed to mean?

24:02.260 --> 24:03.550
Nothing.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.080
Hey...

24:09.260 --> 24:11.260
Do you think we're making a mistake?

24:11.730 --> 24:12.890
You and I?

24:15.520 --> 24:17.520
Well, I don't really give a shit.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.280
You are such a fun kid.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.430
You're quite a mystery, hum?

24:36.870 --> 24:39.660
Fine. I call.
All in.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.930
Can you beat it?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.560
Yeah. You might want
to work on your bluffing skills.

24:47.470 --> 24:49.790
Come on, it's just a
friendly competition.

26:47.610 --> 26:50.210
- Look what I found.
- A little stowaway.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.460
Alright, put that thing
in the bucket.

26:52.540 --> 26:54.800
- And then what?
- We dispose of it.

26:54.820 --> 26:57.000
Dispose? When?
What do you mean dispose?

26:57.020 --> 26:59.900
I am going to eliminate the
little jerk because it's unsanitary.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.420
No, Jonathan is...
the mouse is a member of the crew.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.620
Who, Jonathan?
He has a name?

27:06.650 --> 27:08.120
Of course he has a name!

27:08.140 --> 27:10.420
and he has just as much a right
to be here as the rest of us.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.040
Bug...I...

27:11.070 --> 27:13.520
- He is a crew member.
- You know what, Bug? How about this:

27:13.920 --> 27:17.100
There is no way in hell that
you're going to keep...

27:17.120 --> 27:18.200
No, no, no!

27:18.910 --> 27:20.270
Am I the only sane one here?

27:20.300 --> 27:23.620
Okay, we can't have a germ
infested rodent running around.

27:23.650 --> 27:25.820
- Cold!
- What boy? You more than anybody...

27:25.850 --> 27:27.610
- Calm--
- Guys... Stop it, okay?

27:27.630 --> 27:29.330
Don't...don't touch me.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.080
Hey, stop it, hey!

27:32.110 --> 27:34.110
Hey, knock it off!

27:34.130 --> 27:36.130
Theo, stop it!

27:40.980 --> 27:43.110
Alright, stop it, that is enough!

27:43.900 --> 27:45.420
Seriously?

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
You okay, Bug?

28:48.970 --> 28:50.730
Just a couple seconds.
I got dizzy...

28:51.980 --> 28:53.950
A little nosebleed,
and then I was fine.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.500
It's 'cause you're an asshole.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.530
And probably dehydrated.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.600
You really need to
start taking better care of yourself.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.880
Yeah, sure.

29:05.590 --> 29:07.590
You know, we've been
down here for a while now,

29:07.910 --> 29:09.910
and you still haven't
talked about your family.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.010
That's because there
is not much to talk about.

29:15.490 --> 29:17.740
You know, I'd think
that you'd have to have

29:18.090 --> 29:21.460
some sort of connection. Friends
family, something.

29:21.490 --> 29:23.350
You read my file?

29:23.370 --> 29:25.810
Dad was a pilot,
mom self-medicated.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.650
Sent to boarding school
when I was eight and

29:28.810 --> 29:31.610
they decided to stop visiting
altogether when I was eleven.

29:32.850 --> 29:36.930
Needless to say I learned
a lot about life pretty early on.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.350
This is probably a
small consolation, but...

29:40.950 --> 29:43.940
I mean, down here we're
all kinda like a little family?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.590
I think that 'family'

29:45.620 --> 29:46.950
is greatly over-rated.

29:46.970 --> 29:50.300
But...I hope that
if there's anything wrong with me--

29:55.960 --> 30:00.100
Can you..uh..
can you send Bug in for me please?

30:04.690 --> 30:07.100
Emily, I'm sorry, about that.

30:07.380 --> 30:08.530
It's fine.

30:17.290 --> 30:19.170
Ah, she's already seen
that, Bug.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.830
You missed a spot.

31:14.620 --> 31:15.720
Damn!

31:27.580 --> 31:30.190
Buried in a field, going nowhere,

31:31.970 --> 31:33.880
zero communication, no sun,

31:34.680 --> 31:35.740
all alone,

31:38.100 --> 31:41.150
Well, you mentioned feeling
guilty about leaving your son.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.430
I just wish I could see him.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.820
Yeah.

31:46.790 --> 31:48.010
What was his name?

31:48.640 --> 31:49.690
Sam.

31:51.030 --> 31:52.550
He is a great kid.

31:54.970 --> 31:56.440
What if you
wrote him a letter?

31:56.840 --> 31:58.470
And hide it under my pillow?

32:02.300 --> 32:03.340
No, thanks.

32:16.650 --> 32:18.620
<i>Mission control, do you copy?</i>

32:19.330 --> 32:22.530
<i>Anybody, anybody.
Anybody...</i>

32:24.610 --> 32:25.630
<i>Do you copy?</i>

32:26.120 --> 32:27.170
<i>Copy...</i>

32:28.700 --> 32:29.700

32:32.090 --> 32:34.020
Is this part
of your plan, Walter?

32:48.260 --> 32:49.320
Hey Bug!

32:52.990 --> 32:54.250
Bug, is this urine?

32:54.580 --> 32:55.600
Yeah.

32:56.230 --> 32:57.780
Can you recycle it
for me please?

32:59.730 --> 33:02.250
Bug, we're worried about
you, okay?

33:02.280 --> 33:05.110
It's not healthy for
you to contain yourself like this.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.640
I'm fine. I just need to
finish something

33:07.670 --> 33:09.120
in here first then I'll be right out.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.320
Bug, as a medical adviser,
I'm going to need to...

33:11.790 --> 33:13.280
I said I'm fine!

33:13.570 --> 33:14.820
I'll be right out!

Sam?

34:02.980 --> 34:03.980
Sam?

34:38.620 --> 34:39.620
Hi Daddy.

34:41.770 --> 34:42.770
Where's Mom?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
Around.

34:51.150 --> 34:54.810
Hey did I tell you that I made it to the
final round in that astronaut thing?

34:55.110 --> 34:56.840
Can I come with you?

34:57.910 --> 34:59.090
Wish you could, bud.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.700
How long are you gonna be gone?

35:03.240 --> 35:05.110
I'm gonna be gone a long time.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.220
<i>(more crashes)</i>

36:16.470 --> 36:17.470
What did we do?

36:19.540 --> 36:20.590
Nothing.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.100
Because nobody's supposed
to know we're here.

36:23.550 --> 36:25.060
Well, then who is it?

36:26.820 --> 36:28.690
Protocol says we have to
ignore it.

36:28.790 --> 36:29.990
<i>(knocking)</i>

36:39.390 --> 36:41.390
I can't...
I'm going to go to bed.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.640
It'll stop, eventually.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.930
Right?

38:13.230 --> 38:14.770
What the hell was that?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.170
What...What's wrong?

38:46.080 --> 38:47.800
Hey, Bug!

39:02.670 --> 39:03.670
Stop!

39:07.560 --> 39:08.620
Who is he?

39:08.690 --> 39:09.890
Jesus...

39:10.720 --> 39:13.120
It's okay.
We just want to help you.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.310
Okay. He's sedated.
But how did he get in?

39:37.890 --> 39:40.600
He fought his way through
an access panel on the science module.

39:40.630 --> 39:42.510
I'm telling you that bastard
wanted in.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.960
He wanted in.
- Yeah, but why?

39:46.090 --> 39:48.420
- Did he say anything?
- Wait, it doesn't make any sense.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.710
People don't...
people don't live like this.

39:50.730 --> 39:52.920
This doesn't make any sense.
Something else is going on.

39:53.230 --> 39:54.980
I mean, we're trapped
down here

39:55.180 --> 39:57.180
In this...in this fucking...

39:57.410 --> 39:59.150
...in this metal tube,

39:59.180 --> 40:01.630
we're not in communication,
we don't have any light,

40:01.730 --> 40:03.070
it doesn't make any sense.

40:03.260 --> 40:05.260
Something else is going on.
- Bug!

40:08.860 --> 40:11.740
- Bug!
- Hey! I'll get some water.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.220
(gasping for air)

41:15.740 --> 41:16.910
Dvorak, wake up!

41:17.910 --> 41:18.940
Wake up!

41:23.350 --> 41:24.360
Emily!

41:24.590 --> 41:25.860
Emily, wake up!

41:25.880 --> 41:27.520
- Emily!
- What's happening?

41:27.550 --> 41:30.050
I don't know. Emily,
wake up! Emily!

41:33.700 --> 41:34.700
Emily?

41:39.750 --> 41:40.780
Shit,

41:40.810 --> 41:42.780
she's not breathing.
get some oxygen!

41:58.160 --> 41:59.470
Alright, come on!

42:00.140 --> 42:01.140
Please!

42:01.170 --> 42:02.170
Breathe.

42:19.230 --> 42:19.960
It's okay!

42:19.980 --> 42:22.310
You're breathing!
You're here! You're here!

42:24.730 --> 42:27.260
- I can't breathe...
- I know, shush...

42:28.330 --> 42:29.520
Nice and slow.

42:29.970 --> 42:31.430
Slowly, breathe...

42:42.920 --> 42:44.380
Have you all seen
my bear?

42:45.020 --> 42:46.170
Not now, Bug.

42:46.610 --> 42:47.720
It's gone.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.340
I think that man has it.

42:57.620 --> 42:59.280
Where'd he go?

43:01.520 --> 43:02.920
The breach in the hull

43:02.950 --> 43:05.050
caused our air
to mix with the outside air.

43:05.080 --> 43:06.760
Why would fresh
air be the problem?

43:06.780 --> 43:08.390
Maybe it's a loss of
cabin pressure.

43:08.410 --> 43:11.190
Our oxygen levels
have been slowly dropping.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.400
Steadily, for months.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.280
Never holding at 15 percent.

43:16.450 --> 43:18.300
Wouldn't the computer
warn us about that?

43:18.320 --> 43:21.730
Something...is very
wrong out there.

43:22.050 --> 43:23.160
So what do we do?

43:23.190 --> 43:24.500
We need to watch each other.

43:24.530 --> 43:26.460
Our bodies are going to
slowly adjust

43:26.490 --> 43:29.370
but we're still gonna
be under the effects of hypoxia.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.970
Headaches, delusions...

43:31.990 --> 43:33.930
...memory loss, hallucinations...

43:33.950 --> 43:35.560
How much oxygen do we have left?

43:35.590 --> 43:37.960
We have four or five tanks.
It's not going to last long.

43:37.980 --> 43:39.950
Seal that breach
and we should be fine.

43:39.980 --> 43:42.140
No, there's no fixing the breach.
This is not what we signed up for.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.830
- This is exactly what we signed up for.
- No! It's not!

43:44.930 --> 43:46.130
She almost died!
Alright?

43:46.160 --> 43:47.670
We're getting out of here.

43:48.720 --> 43:51.540
There's no way
that we're leaving here.

43:51.950 --> 43:54.020
We're almost to the end.

43:54.570 --> 43:56.310
If you open up that hatch,

43:56.330 --> 43:57.970
we all lose!

43:58.610 --> 44:01.660
Don't you get it?
It's all a simulation.

44:01.690 --> 44:03.560
For all we know, she
could be faking it!

44:03.590 --> 44:04.030
Faking?

44:04.060 --> 44:06.310
All that data could
have been pre-recorded.

44:06.450 --> 44:10.240
And as our captain, you should
know that we should handle this on-board!

44:10.270 --> 44:12.270
I'm not going to
sit here and debate with you.

44:12.290 --> 44:14.240
Either move--
- Or what?

44:17.720 --> 44:19.080
Sorry.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.970
Bug, I have an idea.

45:43.690 --> 45:44.690
Where are we?

45:48.180 --> 45:49.810
Where did all this dust
come from?

45:50.850 --> 45:51.990
It's too cold.

45:52.450 --> 45:54.010
We got to suit up.

45:56.550 --> 45:58.960
If we take a sample
of this stuff, can you analyze it?

46:00.020 --> 46:01.900
Yeah. Of course.

46:03.340 --> 46:04.510
Alright.

46:11.370 --> 46:13.320
It's designed to
only open from the outside.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.640
I'm not sure I can re-lock it.

46:44.990 --> 46:45.990
Oh, shit.

46:47.690 --> 46:50.070
I have no idea. Right now,
and-- anything is possible.

46:50.090 --> 46:51.410
None of this is making sense.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.870
I know what this is.
They moved us into a giant dome

46:53.890 --> 46:55.360
and made it look like
an alien planet.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.730
It seems obvious to me.
- Come on, Dvorak.

46:58.050 --> 46:59.290
Really, smart guy?

46:59.550 --> 47:00.850
Alright, what's your theory?

47:00.880 --> 47:02.700
Global warming, nuclear war,

47:02.720 --> 47:04.460
Maybe they flew us to
another planet.

47:04.550 --> 47:08.800
I...uh...I analyzed the sample,
and it's pretty crazy.

47:08.910 --> 47:11.600
Um...it's mostly ice
crystals, with carbon,

47:11.620 --> 47:13.430
feldspars, pyroxenes,

47:13.820 --> 47:15.820
a high concentration
of titanium,

47:15.840 --> 47:17.300
and magnesium...
- And?

47:17.890 --> 47:20.800
And uh...armalcolite.

47:21.980 --> 47:23.870
You know armacolite, that doesn't...

47:23.890 --> 47:25.190
Doesn't exist on earth.

47:25.330 --> 47:27.880
First discovered on the moon.
Apollo 11 mission.

47:29.510 --> 47:30.580
You sure?
- Yeah.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.780
I couldn't believe it,
so I ran it again.

47:33.220 --> 47:34.240
The same results.

47:34.260 --> 47:36.680
That's brilliant. They sprinkled
that stuff around the ship

47:36.710 --> 47:38.370
because they knew we would test it.

47:39.020 --> 47:41.540
I'm seriously impressed.
- Guys, we have no answers.

47:41.580 --> 47:42.870
So, what do we do?

47:42.950 --> 47:44.920
We've got to leave
the ship, see what the hell's going on.

47:45.890 --> 47:47.440
You guys better suit up.
It's cold outside.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.630
- Suit up...
- You know they're pretend suits, right?

47:49.660 --> 47:51.020
They weren't meant to--
- Fine.

47:51.050 --> 47:52.700
Go out there without them.

48:02.350 --> 48:05.370
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

48:17.790 --> 48:19.260
This is a dream, right?

48:20.020 --> 48:21.190
Or a nightmare.

48:21.830 --> 48:22.920
Where are the trees?

48:24.230 --> 48:25.740
There used to be trees here, guys.

48:26.450 --> 48:27.750
You guys remember?

48:27.780 --> 48:30.900
Doesn't...do you...
doesn't anybody else not see the trees?

48:31.480 --> 48:33.890
Bug...listen to me...

48:34.480 --> 48:36.390
This is just an experiment.

48:36.420 --> 48:37.870
The shots they gave us,

48:37.900 --> 48:39.930
psychotropic drugs.

48:39.960 --> 48:43.330
Used to open us
up to suggestion and paranoia.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.800
This is just a game.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.090
Maybe we're dead.  Are we dead?

48:49.510 --> 48:53.610
Maybe the last bit of electrical energy
in our synapses is expiring...

48:54.770 --> 48:57.730
Maybe it's a collective hallucination.
I've heard about African tribes--

48:57.750 --> 48:58.940
I don't think so, Bug.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.590
It happens all the time.

49:00.610 --> 49:02.610
Accounts of people
seeing the Virgin Mary,

49:02.630 --> 49:04.060
sailors seeing ghost ships
that are

49:04.090 --> 49:05.530
there one minute and gone
the next.

49:05.950 --> 49:07.930
Hey Bug, you feel that?

49:08.110 --> 49:10.920
- Yeah.
- Good, that's how you know it's real.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.740
What...what about our families?

49:13.760 --> 49:15.110
Our friends...are they dead?

49:15.140 --> 49:17.130
Just calm down. okay?
There must be some kind

49:17.150 --> 49:19.200
of explanation for all of this.

49:44.110 --> 49:45.280
<i>(child laughing)</i>

49:46.370 --> 49:47.370
You okay?

49:47.510 --> 49:48.570
<i>(child laughing)</i>

49:48.930 --> 49:51.390
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what, Bug?

49:54.940 --> 49:56.100
Laughter.

49:59.870 --> 50:01.420
I heard-- heard laughter.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.870
It's okay, Bug,
it's just the wind.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.100
Hey

50:19.730 --> 50:21.460
How long have we
been walking?

50:22.300 --> 50:25.380
I don't know.
Maybe an hour or two?

50:25.900 --> 50:28.270
Looks like Walter spared
no expense.

51:04.790 --> 51:06.760
The same guy
who broke into our ship.

51:38.940 --> 51:40.040
Look at this.

51:41.450 --> 51:43.330
Somebody crossed out
each one of these cities,

51:43.350 --> 51:44.790
except for this one here.

51:44.990 --> 51:46.430
What do you think it means?

51:46.730 --> 51:49.400
I don't know. Maybe
they were looking for something.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.140
Survivors?

51:51.160 --> 51:53.420
Maybe. Guys, check it out.

51:54.910 --> 51:57.830
Let's see if we can find somebody who
knows what the hell's   going on.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.570
Everything okay?

52:14.020 --> 52:15.490
Shh!

52:16.490 --> 52:18.490
I'm looking for microphones.

52:19.160 --> 52:20.520
Hidden cameras.

52:21.980 --> 52:24.680
You know that Walter is
watching us right now

52:24.700 --> 52:26.490
and he is laughing his ass off.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.250
Aren't you, Walter?

52:34.380 --> 52:35.380
Let's go.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.060
Seriously?

52:46.310 --> 52:47.940
So I take it we're leaving?

52:48.530 --> 52:53.810
<i># Daisy, Daisy, give
me your answer do... #</i>

52:54.830 --> 52:57.400
<i># I'll go crazy #</i>

52:57.790 --> 52:59.730
<i># All for the love of you. #</i>

53:00.180 --> 53:02.520
<i># There won't be a
stylish marriage, #</i>

53:02.820 --> 53:05.500
<i># We can't afford a carriage... #</i>

53:05.840 --> 53:11.000
<i># But youâ€™ll look sweet upon the seat
of a bicycle built for two #</i>

53:14.430 --> 53:15.970
I think I see it.

53:18.600 --> 53:21.290
Yeah, looks like they
left the lights on.

54:17.340 --> 54:19.120
I'm taking mine off.

54:45.970 --> 54:46.970
Hello!

54:48.320 --> 54:51.340
Earth to civilization,
anyone home?

54:59.490 --> 55:01.510
What the hell is that for?

55:02.270 --> 55:04.020
No one's gonna mind.

55:04.040 --> 55:06.730
Besides, a little noise
might get us some attention.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.600
Hello?

55:41.780 --> 55:43.080
Party of four?

55:44.770 --> 55:45.770
Excuse me?

55:49.590 --> 55:50.860
You're here to eat, right?

55:51.810 --> 55:53.660
No.  No.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.970
We need to
know what happened.

55:56.590 --> 55:57.780
What do you mean?

55:57.970 --> 55:58.980
I mean...

56:00.300 --> 56:04.160
How bad was it?
Is everyone gone?

56:04.780 --> 56:06.320
Is it like this everywhere?

56:13.150 --> 56:14.150
Come on in.

56:16.150 --> 56:17.520
You're hungry, right?

56:18.750 --> 56:19.750
Come.

56:41.850 --> 56:43.340
Come in, come in.

56:51.210 --> 56:52.600
Come on in, sit down.

56:52.620 --> 56:54.740
Um, we're  actually--
we're not here to eat.

56:54.770 --> 56:57.540
We just need to--
- (wispering)  In a minuite, miss.

57:00.810 --> 57:02.300
First we eat.

57:07.500 --> 57:08.760
Darla!

57:10.040 --> 57:12.590
We got guests!

57:13.560 --> 57:16.060
Now, my name is Zell.

57:16.080 --> 57:18.480
I'll be your host,
you hang tight,

57:18.510 --> 57:20.780
and my wife will bring your
food out in a moment.

57:23.880 --> 57:25.660
Okay, what the hell is
going on here?

57:25.690 --> 57:28.310
I'm not eating whatever
he brings us.

57:28.340 --> 57:30.240
Isn't it odd that all of the
street lights are on?

57:30.270 --> 57:32.050
Probably running on a generator.

57:32.070 --> 57:34.870
Yes, why?
I mean, why waste all the power?

57:34.950 --> 57:37.480
It's dark, people need
to see.

57:38.260 --> 57:40.400
I think they're meant
to be seen from a distance.

57:40.430 --> 57:42.050
These people look familiar to you?

57:42.070 --> 57:43.550
I don't think so.

57:44.050 --> 57:45.800
Look again, 'cause...

57:46.610 --> 57:49.120
don't they seem like the reporters
from the press conference?

57:51.420 --> 57:53.680
See this hot chick behind
me in this booth over here?

57:53.700 --> 57:54.830
That's Miss February.

57:55.360 --> 57:57.470
Yeah, I know her...
very well.

57:57.490 --> 57:59.160
I don't want to be
here anymore,

57:59.190 --> 58:01.940
I don't know what's going on.
I wanna go home.

58:04.500 --> 58:07.180
She is my queen.
The diamond that holds my heart.

58:08.410 --> 58:11.190
The best darn wife
that a man could hope for.

58:11.670 --> 58:14.190
- We're not married.
- We're just waiting for the right...

58:14.580 --> 58:16.040
...time, that's all.

58:16.580 --> 58:17.980
Right time...

58:18.140 --> 58:19.830
there's no right time anymore.

58:20.450 --> 58:23.270
Can you please tell us
what's going on...here?

58:23.300 --> 58:25.300
We're all awfully confused.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.390
Aren't we all?

58:37.590 --> 58:39.790
Why won't anyone
just give us a straight answer?

58:40.490 --> 58:42.490
Because they're fishing.

58:51.970 --> 58:54.180
Have you seen any other survivors?

58:55.180 --> 58:56.260
No.

59:00.680 --> 59:04.260
You see?
Have-- have you just been hiding-out then?

59:06.200 --> 59:07.300
Yep.

59:10.560 --> 59:11.760
That's smart.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.400
You can't trust anybody
these days.

59:17.330 --> 59:18.420
Why's that?

59:18.630 --> 59:22.540
You got these fancy suits,
you have these fancy helmets,

59:23.840 --> 59:25.140
what else you got?

59:30.430 --> 59:33.370
I apologize.
Formally, I apologize.

59:33.740 --> 59:35.740
Sometimes my curiosity just...

59:37.550 --> 59:40.330
gets the best of me.
People like us need to stick together.

59:41.510 --> 59:46.260
Look ah, we appreciate
your...hospitality,

59:46.730 --> 59:48.920
but we really need some
answers. We need to know...

59:49.520 --> 59:51.130
what's going on.
Everything.

59:51.150 --> 59:52.210
Everything?

59:52.250 --> 59:53.330
Yeah.

59:56.490 --> 59:57.630
You know nothing?

59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.730
You must have had
a really good hiding spot!

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720
The truth is...

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.920
nobody knows what happened.

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:21.660
It's just the black... thing...
in the sky

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:28.290
smacked into the moon
and then sent a cloud of dust into a ring

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.490
up into space and not long
after that, it just

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.060
started raining down on us and...

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.600
we sucked it right up.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.420
Fellows over there,
they're conspiracy nut jobs,

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:44.690
hear what I'm saying...

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:46.910
nukes and aliens!

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:50.880
Shit like that.
If the government knew about it...

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.860
they did not give one
bit of warning. Not one at all.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.330
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but...

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440
we might be the only ones left.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.910
- It's delicious.
- Thank you.  My own recipe.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.000
I have a question for you, Zell.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.000
About the press conference.
- Come again?

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:28.030
The press conference.
The one before we left.

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:31.430
I just... I can't seem to
place you.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.980
I think your friend here has
been beaten one too many

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.360
times with the crazy stick.

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.690
That's good.  You are good.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.200
This guy's good.
I'm... I'm the crazy one.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.910
Next thing you know you're going to tell
me that earpiece isn't a hearing aid.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.270
Walter is feeding you lines
right now, right?

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:54.600
You're good at...

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.560
testing my patience.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.420
- Zell!
- Sorry about that!

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.510
Sorry about that.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:06.980
How'd you all fare so well?

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.120
Look, we just got lucky.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.920
A little thing...
I like to call

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.710
pride of ownership.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.000
In this here town, it's
all we've got.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.670
We just like to make sure
so it's in...

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.560
tip top shape, so
you folks can spend the night

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.810
and after that,

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.120
you're going to have to get going.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.130
Eat up.

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:31.380
I'll get some blankets and
stuff from the back.

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.880
Oh, if you are done up to it...

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:34.960
if you're parched...

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:37.670
I got a little watering-hole right on down
the street, you're welcome to it.

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:39.930
I'll leave the door unlocked.

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:46.410
You guys aren't buying
any of this, right?

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.190
Yeah...

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:51.360
Okay, look, you don't think it's odd that
Bug did a dust analysis...

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.690
and found magical moon dirt, then we
get a map that leads us directly here.

01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:56.600
This whack-a-doo here says
the moon was struck.

01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:57.730
That is very convenient.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.220
I know it sounds crazy,
but think about it.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.790
It all adds up.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.270
Whatever.

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:06.410
You guys can sit
here and cry in your soup.

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:08.080
Tell me you're kidding.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:09.670
No, I'm not kidding.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.010
I've been locked in a box
for over a year.

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:13.700
I'm going to the bar.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:15.390
Come on.

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:23.520
I don't think we should split up.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.870
Let's go.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:38.100
What the hell is this place?

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.680
(laughs)

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.380
Alright.

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.610
- Four beers.
- No beer.

01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:53.830
Just the house special.
- What's that?

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.560
- The less you see the better.
- Sounds delicious.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.810
Is this going to be on Zell's tab?

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.520
Ah! Wow!

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.290
Four of those.  That's it.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.600
Hi

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:17.370
Six.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.590
It's nice to be
amongst the living again, huh?

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700
Thanks.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.650
For putting up with
my bullshit for the last year.

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:38.200
You guys are the closest thing
I've had to a family in-- in a long time.

01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.990
I need another.

01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:55.450
Hi.

01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:57.020
Hey.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:00.750
What's a tall drink of handsome like you
doing in a place like this?

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.710
I'm just looking for someone who
likes to mix her metaphors.

01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:07.750
Oh, seriously, what are you
doing here?

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:10.620
Let's just say that...uh...

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.030
I'm tired of simulating.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040
Yeah...

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:17.860
Does this feel real enough?

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:19.890
It's a good start.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.360
Okay, am I the only one
here that thinks this is not a good idea?

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.550
Yeah, I'll go get him.

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:43.010
Hey.

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:44.790
Hey!

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.040
Have you seen my friend?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.120
That guy that was here
with that girl.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400
No.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.460
No?

01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:02.570
He's gone.

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:04.570
What do you mean?

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.080
Must have left with the woman.

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.710
Unbelievable.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.930
We'll just wait for a bit.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.960
Maybe he'll show up.

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:13.710
Yeah.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.160
I think it's time for you to leave.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.680
I don't think he's coming back.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.180
Maybe Dvorak was right.

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.450
Maybe Dvorak was right,  this was all
some sort of exercise

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:50.110
And we're all
just being played, and

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.870
he was able to see
through it from the beginning.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.270
For all we know, he could be back
at mission control right now.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:00.470
Or maybe we're all in mission
control right now

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.490
just sleeping. This is just
some sort of a dream...

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.840
or maybe it's...
maybe we were drugged.

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.170
- Bug!
- It feels like...

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:08.050
some sort of drug-induced...
- Bug!

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.430
You should really get
some sleep, okay?

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:12.800
Yeah, we should sleep in shifts.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.100
One of us should stand watch.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120
I'll go first.
- No, I'll...I'll go.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.090
I don't think I can
sleep right now anyway.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.220
Bug, I don't think that's
a really good idea.

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.500
Please?

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.940
Okay.

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:45.770
How is he?

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.359
Shh!

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.170
(whispering) Sam.

01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:48.569
Sam?

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.060
Hi Bug.

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:00.250
What you doing back here?

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.800
Have you seen our friend Bug?

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:28.270
Everything okay?

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.970
Where's Bug?  Whereâ€™s Dvorak?

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.560
Have you seen our friends?

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.200
- What friends?
- The guys that we came with.

01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.440
It's only been you two.

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:44.910
No.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.380
You're oxygen deprived.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.430
That's what it is.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.610
Now you start seeing
things that aren't there.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.440
or not seeing things
that are there.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.460
No, there was two
other guys here that were with us.

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.350
Hey, hey, whoa.

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:03.190
What are you doing?

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:05.160
Looking for cameras, microphones.

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.720
- Theo.
- Whoa. Hey!

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.900
I don't get what you're
trying to pull,

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.940
but I think it's time you head back
to your ship.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:15.350
What'd you say?

01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:17.520
He said you should head back.

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.030
I--

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:20.940
No, you said ship.

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:24.150
How did you know we
were on a ship?

01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:33.270
Let's go.  No, wait.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.750
- Theo,
- Where's Walter?

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.400
- Theo.
- Okay, Tell Walter that...

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.450
this isn't funny anymore.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.360
Hey, Theo, let's go. This
isn't a game. We gotta leave.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.420
Theo, come on,
we've got to find shelter.

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.650
We can't leave them.

01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:06.370
Emily!

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280
Emily where are you?

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.090
Emily!

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.330
Emily!

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:35.960
Emily?

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:01.640
Help.

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:02.800
Help.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.850
Come help me.

01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:21.750
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.420
I'm sorry

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:50.430
Theo!

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.360
Where did you go?

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.910
- My God, what happened?
- You okay?

01:14:58.830 --> 01:15:00.420
We gotta... we gotta go.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.460
Right here.  Here.

01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:26.390
I'm gonna go look in there.

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.170
This is going to
stop the bleeding, okay?

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:34.510
Where'd you get that?

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.250
Where'd you get that?

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.680
My first-aid kit.
I always  have it with me.

01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:43.180
That was not from the ship.

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:46.410
All mission items are bar-coded.
Track usage.  It doesn't have one.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.470
Theo.

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.870
You need to relax, okay?
You're in shock.

01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:38.780
Come on.
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.440
I don't think we can make it
back to the ship.

01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:13.950
Almost done.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.150
You really need to get some rest.

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.610
Can I ask you a question?

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.840
Yeah.

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:40.600
What did Walter whisper
to you...

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.050
before we got on the ship?

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.000
Um... I don't remember.

01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:59.830
There's this thing that you do
when keeping a secret:

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:02.240
you pull your ear lobe,

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.590
kind of like you're doing right now.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.890
What did he say to you?

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.140
He asked if we still had a deal.

01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:21.470
What...what...
what do you mean? What deal?

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:26.680
Two weeks before we left
for the mission,

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.930
he told me that if I didn't end it,

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:32.450
that he was going
to kick me off the mission.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.650
End it? What do
you mean? You mean--

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:37.680
You mean us?

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.170
Why?

01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:45.570
He said the research that
he needed to see...

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.730
if we could still
fulfill our duties after our breakup,

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:51.460
Why didn't you just tell me?
Why didn't you just talk to me about this?

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.520
We could have figured it out.
We could have faked it.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.250
I would have told you
if I could, but

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.630
there's no way, and
you know it. Walter would have known.

01:18:57.690 --> 01:19:00.040
He was watching us 24/7.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.020
And I wanted us to
do this mission together.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.560
And I thought at least this way

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.320
we could still do it.

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.470
I would have told you.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.360
I would have risked it.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.260
I was scared, Theo.

01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:21.760
Believe me, I wanted
to tell you.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.210
You wanted to tell me.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400
I'm sorry.

01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:30.450
So am I.

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.190
Maybe Bug was right.

01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:39.330
Maybe this was just a nightmare.

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.600
Yeah, now I'm ready
to wake up.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.780
(whispering) Theo?

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:02.420
We should go.

01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:20.440
I never thought I would
be so happy to see it again.

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:31.430
Bug?

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:33.020
Dvorak?

01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:36.370
Okay?

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.040
Bug?

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.500
They're here.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.620
Who? Zell?

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.050
It's so stupid.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.250
They let us escape so
they could follow us back here.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.810
What do we do?

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.810
The only thing we can.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.840
We defend the ship,
we fight back.

01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:28.420
Hurry. We can't lock the hatch.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.230
I'm going to climb up
and find a place to hide.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.640
Be careful.

01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:12.180
Hello!

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.630
You don't look so good.

01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:21.150
What'd you do with my friends?

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.020
Your friends?

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:28.270
Nothing.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.220
Nothing.

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:34.670
Your friends are back in town.

01:24:42.450 --> 01:24:44.260
We just came here to get you.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160
Bring you back.

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:49.740
Why don't you put
down your knife, too?

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:53.560
You and I will go back together.

01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:36.390
<i>Congratulations.
You made it.</i>

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:40.900
<i>I know the voyage was
frought with difficulties and surprises.</i>

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:44.730
<i>I just want you to know
from the bottom of my heart</i>

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.810
<i>how proud I am of you.</i>

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.210
<i>Thank you...  honestly,  again...
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

01:26:52.770 --> 01:26:54.480
<i>Anyway, there's a lot
of people out here</i>

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:56.220
<i>who are anxious to
say hello to you.</i>

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.570
<i>To thank you just like me, so...</i>

01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:03.200
<i>Let's come on out of there,
and let's call this mission done.</i>

01:27:04.305 --> 01:27:10.706
