00:02.690 --> 00:04.790
Hey, it's Saturday morning, eight-o'clock,

00:04.790 --> 00:07.270
and you know what that means!

00:08.109 --> 00:10.400
It's time for Charlie Green and the K-Teen scene!

00:10.410 --> 00:11.730
What's hot? What's hip?

00:11.790 --> 00:13.990
What's cracking in your cranium? 
Cloggin' in your noggin?!

00:14.020 --> 00:15.510
Wake up and talk to me, me, me!

00:15.510 --> 00:17.280
Me, me, me!

00:17.340 --> 00:20.840
This guy is way to over the top, top, top.

00:20.860 --> 00:21.710
And while you're dialling,

00:21.710 --> 00:24.480
grab your brain around a little morning Montana!

00:26.400 --> 00:29.270
Oh, but he has great taste, taste, taste.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.320
I'll take pop stars with enormous
egos for two hundred dollars.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.270
Man, this is the best part-time job ever.

00:35.450 --> 00:36.260
You know last week,

00:36.260 --> 00:39.660
Charlie let me hit the "wing-ding-ding" button

00:40.540 --> 00:42.410
Why Oliver! Maybe if you're lucky,

00:42.590 --> 00:45.610
next week, you can hit the "boing" button.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.570
Ignore her. I think it's totally "grawesome".

00:49.090 --> 00:52.890
Oh, see, that's "great" and "awesome". Grawesome!

00:53.580 --> 00:55.240
I'm starting a new trad.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.920
Well see, that's "trend" and "fad". Trad!

00:59.720 --> 01:01.550
And you are officially "sweird".

01:02.110 --> 01:04.349
That's so and weird.

01:06.540 --> 01:07.470
I mean look at him.

01:07.470 --> 01:10.090
The guy doesn't stop for four hours straight.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.620
Charlie, your wife's on line one.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.540
He's a total bro.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.640
You know he hasn't missed a show in ten years.

01:16.760 --> 01:22.530
Argh! My baby's having a wife! 
My bife is having a waby! Argh!

01:23.340 --> 01:25.750
OK, one show in ten years.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.540
OK, we're on live air in ten seconds.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.100
Let's see what you've got, "wing-ding-ding" boy.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.400
Go, go, go, go!

01:31.570 --> 01:33.380
But I don't even know...

01:33.800 --> 01:35.200
You'll do great.

01:41.150 --> 01:43.890
Argh... that was argh...

01:43.890 --> 01:45.560
"Let's Do This," by...

01:46.460 --> 01:48.890
by... by um...

01:49.320 --> 01:54.420
Mi...  little, favourite. Hannah Montana.

01:55.230 --> 01:58.510
Isn't she um grawesome?

02:00.150 --> 02:02.770
That's great and argh... and awesome.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.590
Grawesome.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.590
Was it that lame when I said it?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.350
Yep, pretty much.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074

03:04.610 --> 03:07.960
We argh... having some fun now, huh?

03:09.850 --> 03:12.260
Oh, no, no, wait. I didn't know. I didn't mean to click that,

03:12.270 --> 03:13.690
I meant argh... I meant argh...

03:18.100 --> 03:20.690
-He's very bad.  -Very, very bad.

03:22.140 --> 03:24.020
OK, here's our first caller...

03:24.250 --> 03:25.940
-You stink!  -Thanks for calling.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.720
-Somebody's gotta save him.  -Absolutely.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.060
Rock, scissors, paper, shoot!

03:32.180 --> 03:33.270
Dang it!

03:35.100 --> 03:38.810
Like I should be the DJ! I don't 
know anything about this!

03:39.150 --> 03:44.420
Hello! This is Miley Ray and Smoken Oken.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.620
If you're in a stew or feeling blue,

03:46.620 --> 03:49.020
don't boo-hoo, let us talk to you.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.860
'Cause that's what we do.

03:50.860 --> 03:53.430
Here at the K-Teen morning zoo!

03:57.020 --> 03:58.980
Hello, you're on with Miley Ray!

03:58.980 --> 04:00.260
And Smoken Oken!

04:00.260 --> 04:02.780
You know, I met this girl and I think she likes me.

04:02.860 --> 04:03.900
How do I find out?

04:03.980 --> 04:05.450
Be honest and ask her.

04:05.450 --> 04:07.260
Oh! You are such a girl.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.230
OK. Pretend you couldn't care less,

04:10.230 --> 04:11.980
then get one of your friends to ask her.

04:12.550 --> 04:14.960
Hello! Is anybody home?

04:17.800 --> 04:18.820
Doesn't look like it.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.640
This is what you're really going to do, OK?

04:22.490 --> 04:23.760
Hey, that looks like fun.

04:24.270 --> 04:26.220
-You should of gone with paper. 
 -Don't rub it in!

04:31.300 --> 04:32.890
No, no, no!

04:32.910 --> 04:34.880
These numbers can't be right.

04:34.910 --> 04:36.700
This is so unfair.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.000
Counting the number of kids at
 school that hate you again?

04:40.630 --> 04:44.770
'Cause that's definitely not high enough! BURN!

04:45.270 --> 04:49.480
This is serious. It's the worst 
news a person like me can get.

04:51.710 --> 04:55.350
Jackson. I'm making too much money.

04:56.450 --> 04:57.700
Hold me!

04:58.720 --> 05:01.590
Great, now I'm going to have to boil the shirt.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.630
And how could anybody make "too much" money?

05:04.680 --> 05:07.820
The shack makes a lot of money.

05:08.110 --> 05:12.000
So my dad thinks he can 
sell it for a lot of money.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.710
The only way to stop him is 
if it starts losing money.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.260
Then no one will want to buy it.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.320
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot!

05:21.360 --> 05:23.290
-You still don't get it, do you?  -No, not really.

05:24.870 --> 05:27.210
-I have to lose money!  -So lose money.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.420
I can't! It goes against every fibre in my being.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.310
Watch.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.880
See! I can't get rid of it.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.110
You try.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.280
Whoa. It's like Uncle Earl with the last hot wing

05:48.280 --> 05:50.510
at the bottom of the jumbo bucket.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.880
I'm just not dumb enough to lose money.

05:58.940 --> 06:01.570
Congratulations! The shack is all yours.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.430
Oh. Oh yeah I get it.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.310
So you don't think I'm smart 
enough to make money?

06:06.320 --> 06:07.540
Well I got news for you.

06:07.540 --> 06:09.590
I'm going to make more
 money than you ever made!

06:09.610 --> 06:11.070
And then when you sell this place,

06:11.070 --> 06:12.830
I'm gonna be the one in charge.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.870
Permanently.

06:14.910 --> 06:16.880
Yeah. Like that'll ever happen.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.680
Hey. When it comes to money, 
I'm just as savvy as you are.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.420
Try to take it.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.720
I already did.

06:28.770 --> 06:31.030
And just because I was the 
one who asked him out,

06:31.040 --> 06:32.770
he thought I should pay!

06:32.790 --> 06:33.980
Is he right?

06:34.220 --> 06:36.320
Absolutely!

06:36.450 --> 06:37.480
... Not!

06:37.590 --> 06:41.190
I say, if he doesn't even bother
 to kick in, kick him!

06:41.400 --> 06:44.360
Yeah, kick him good! Hoo-ya!

06:47.530 --> 06:50.100
Whoa! Four hours and the
 phones haven't stopped.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.780
Not too shabby.

06:53.190 --> 06:55.480
I'm fine, thanks for asking!

06:57.480 --> 06:59.300
You know, I can't believe we're almost outta here,

06:59.310 --> 07:01.480
but we have time for one more caller.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.700
Caller, you are on with Miley and Smoken,

07:03.700 --> 07:04.640
what's your question?

07:04.760 --> 07:07.510
Argh, yeah bud, what do 
you do if your kid's a pop-star

07:07.540 --> 07:11.570
who forgot she has a rehearsal for 
a music video in ten minutes!

07:12.630 --> 07:14.130
Hey, are you going to make a run... Ahhh

07:17.900 --> 07:21.420
Once again, I'm fine, THANKS!

07:28.640 --> 07:30.860
Men, sports and food.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.390
Did somebody say, "cha-ching"!

07:34.960 --> 07:36.480
Alright, who's ready to order?

07:36.490 --> 07:38.920
Get out of the way we're watching the game!

07:39.000 --> 07:40.730
And more free peanuts!

07:42.690 --> 07:45.000
Ha. You had me buy an expensive TV,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.090
you give away free peanuts

07:47.140 --> 07:48.630
and no one's buying food!

07:49.400 --> 07:52.830
At this rate, the Shack will 
be bankrupt by morning.

07:53.050 --> 07:54.320
I'm so proud of you.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.570
Hey, it's a minor setback!

07:56.620 --> 07:59.200
What has two thumbs and plenty of great ideas?

07:59.300 --> 08:00.670
This guy!

08:03.100 --> 08:04.810
There you go, enjoy.

08:05.420 --> 08:06.970
Ha! Games over.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.420
Everybody's starving and they got a grill for fish,

08:09.420 --> 08:10.730
I'm selling at top dollar!

08:10.900 --> 08:13.160
Could somebody give me a "cha-ching"!

08:13.450 --> 08:14.950
I'm still not worried.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.730
With you in charge, something has to go wrong.

08:18.100 --> 08:22.020
Hey, what's that dark cloud moving this way?

08:23.030 --> 08:24.020
Oh no.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.470
No.

08:40.450 --> 08:45.040
You say "cha-ching", I say "cha-chump"!

08:52.330 --> 08:54.200
Who the heck came up with the idea

08:54.310 --> 08:57.610
to shoot my music video in a 
taekwondo studio, I'm exhausted!

08:57.610 --> 08:59.450
I'm sorry honey, I thought it was a good idea,

08:59.520 --> 09:02.640
but it sounds like it was more of a case of "taekwondo."

09:02.890 --> 09:03.980
(laughs)

09:05.000 --> 09:07.600
I must be tired. I actually laughed at that.

09:07.610 --> 09:08.710
I don't care, it still counts.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.550
All I want to do, is go home, get in a hot bath,

09:13.780 --> 09:16.190
and then drive my pruned-up bod to bed.

09:16.470 --> 09:18.850
Well honey, you better not prune-so-soon.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.360
Did you forget about your concert 
tonight in San Diego?

09:21.390 --> 09:23.220
-That's tonight?  -Yeah, it's in two hours.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.590
Hey I have a concert in two hours.

09:27.470 --> 09:29.610
Whoa, nothing gets by you.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.500
You know what, you might
 need to do is take a little  nap on the way there.

09:32.620 --> 09:34.620
No, I hate doing that before a concert.

09:34.630 --> 09:35.810
I guess I'll just have to shake it off.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.790
Thank you guys so much! 
Goodnight, goodnight I love you!

10:01.810 --> 10:04.020
OK, next stop pruney dream land.

10:04.090 --> 10:05.960
Well you heard it darling, I'll tell you that.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.350
That was a great show. At least what I saw of it.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.430
I took a nap during the first act.

10:12.930 --> 10:15.380
What? It's a long show.

10:15.470 --> 10:17.120
Plus, there's fireworks in the second act.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.100
Nice. Can't watch your only daughter perform

10:20.120 --> 10:21.380
but you can stay up 'til 3:00 AM

10:21.380 --> 10:23.350
watching the Three Stooges versus Godzilla?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.010
Well honey, you're talking about a classic there.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.840
'Sup Oliver?

10:31.060 --> 10:32.300
Miley, guess what.

10:32.390 --> 10:35.080
Charlie Green's wife accidently 
kicked him during the delivery,

10:35.110 --> 10:38.000
knocked him out cold. Isn't this great!

10:38.900 --> 10:42.090
And you're happy about this because...

10:42.200 --> 10:45.150
Well until they unwire his jaw, 
we get to keep doing the show.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.380
They want us back tomorrow morning at six.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.210
Six!

10:48.530 --> 10:51.410
Oliver, I can't, I'm sorry, I just finished a concert and...

10:51.410 --> 10:52.170
But Miley,

10:52.170 --> 10:54.210
They said that if we do as good as we did today,

10:54.490 --> 10:56.200
we could get our own show.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.060
Oliver...

10:57.200 --> 10:59.020
Breaks like this don't just happen.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.910
I mean this could change my whole life.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.490
Well...

11:02.660 --> 11:06.810
Pleeeeeeeeeee...

11:07.160 --> 11:09.360
Come on Mile, you got your schoolwork,

11:09.360 --> 11:10.880
you got your Hannah stuff...

11:11.040 --> 11:12.310
The last thing you need to do is put

11:12.320 --> 11:13.770
something else on your plate.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.940
Yeah, I guess you're right.

11:17.930 --> 11:21.900
...leasssssseee....

11:22.150 --> 11:24.520
Well, argh... oh...

11:25.780 --> 11:27.270
OK, fine I'll do it.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.070
I'll see you at the studio at six.

11:30.080 --> 11:30.960
Yes!

11:31.300 --> 11:33.600
So when I talk to you is the
 only thing you hear is...

11:36.850 --> 11:40.450
Dad. You heard Oliver. 
This is important to him.

11:40.510 --> 11:42.610
Well so is everything else you gotta do.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.910
Like hosting that pet adoption thing tomorrow.

11:44.990 --> 11:46.130
What pet adoption thing?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.370
Oh hey, I'm hosting a pet adoption thing tomorrow.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
Really?

11:51.440 --> 11:52.450
OK Dad, look.

11:52.490 --> 11:54.650
We'll be home in like an hour and a half,

11:54.710 --> 11:55.720
I'll go straight to bed and

11:55.720 --> 11:57.290
I'll get plenty of rest and do both.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.260
Easy peezie lemon squez...

12:00.410 --> 12:01.600
Why are we stopping?

12:01.810 --> 12:03.860
I don't know, but I think I 
reckon it's got something

12:03.860 --> 12:06.530
to do with that massive traffic jam up there.

12:07.710 --> 12:10.530
OK I don't know how, but you did this on purpose.

12:17.100 --> 12:17.790
Oh my gosh,

12:17.790 --> 12:19.730
how much longer are we
 going to be stuck in traffic?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.030
This is exactly why I didn't

12:22.030 --> 12:23.190
want you getting in over your head...

12:23.200 --> 12:25.670
Dad! Don't say it. OK,

12:25.700 --> 12:27.400
it's going to take a little longer to get home, but...

12:27.410 --> 12:29.840
you know what. I'm going to sleep right here.

12:31.230 --> 12:34.010
Slouch down a little bit. Slouchy.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.590
Mmmm.

12:38.650 --> 12:41.730
Squishy soft. I'm so happy 
you stopped working out.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.370
You're mean when you're tired.

12:48.980 --> 12:50.140
Sweet niblets!

12:55.030 --> 12:58.760
Yo! Freeway Philharmonic, can the horn section

12:59.000 --> 13:00.610
I'm trying to get a little sleep here!

13:00.830 --> 13:03.010
Mommy, it's Hannah Montana!

13:08.100 --> 13:09.550
Everybody's watchin me

13:09.580 --> 13:11.360
Its never as easy as it seems

13:11.380 --> 13:12.760
To be super super

13:12.990 --> 13:14.690
I'm super super girl

13:14.870 --> 13:16.590
Thank you San Diego freeway,

13:16.610 --> 13:19.310
you are the best freeway audience in the world!

13:21.530 --> 13:25.040
I cannot believe I just did 
another three hour concert.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.780
Excuse me driver, can you open this door,

13:29.790 --> 13:30.950
he's walking home.

13:35.550 --> 13:37.720
Yes Oliver, I know I'm late.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.940
I'll be there, I promise, I just have to change.

13:39.970 --> 13:41.220
Darlin', you can't still be going,

13:41.220 --> 13:42.620
you haven't slept since yesterday!

13:42.650 --> 13:43.840
Will you stop worrying, I'm fine!

13:43.860 --> 13:46.260
Yeah but what about that pet 
adoption thing this afternoon?

13:46.280 --> 13:47.270
I got it covered.

13:47.740 --> 13:48.590
Whoa.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.830
Yeah I would've been faster but those

13:49.830 --> 13:51.610
four bottles of water I had in the limo...

13:51.730 --> 13:53.200
really caught up with me.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.320
I caught my boyfriend talking to another girl...

13:59.330 --> 14:00.460
what do I do?

14:00.660 --> 14:03.180
Hmmm... you know what,
 that's an interesting question

14:03.240 --> 14:05.450
but I think I might have the answer for you.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.050
Back off! Give the guy a little bit of space!

14:09.100 --> 14:11.230
I mean, what are you, his mother?

14:12.610 --> 14:15.440
We are men, so we are hunters.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.770
It's what we do.

14:18.370 --> 14:21.110
But I sure Miley has a 
different opinion on this one.

14:22.450 --> 14:23.560
Ya think?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.950
Sweet niblets, ya mud-crunkie,

14:27.010 --> 14:29.870
-what I'd do is... 
 -That's not Miley!

14:30.610 --> 14:33.950
Argh... caller with a problem say what?

14:35.130 --> 14:36.110
Possum!

14:38.110 --> 14:40.100
Where's the real Miley Ray?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.600
Well apparently she got
 sidetracked ruining my career.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.910
When have I ever said 'possum'?

14:49.520 --> 14:51.590
Congratulations, caller!

14:51.630 --> 14:54.630
You spotted the Fake Miley!

14:56.100 --> 14:57.390
...And, you get two free

14:57.390 --> 14:59.540
Hannah Montana concert tickets.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.020
Hope that helps you get over 
the end of your relationship.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.260
You mean it's over?

15:03.540 --> 15:05.830
Deader than a possum on the free... way.

15:06.830 --> 15:07.700
Dang it!

15:08.070 --> 15:09.640
You said possum.

15:15.820 --> 15:18.440
Whoa. Looks like business is pretty good.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.240
What did you do this time?

15:20.430 --> 15:22.030
Proved you wrong, that's all.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.710
Found a new meat supplier.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.200
Half of what we usually pay.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.420
Which means Rico's is raking it in.

15:27.810 --> 15:30.030
Hey, what has two thumbs and doesn't loose money?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.800
This guy!

15:33.560 --> 15:34.850
Why are you smiling?

15:35.360 --> 15:38.510
Because I have faith in your ability
 to somehow mess this up.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.180
I don't know how, but you will.

15:42.770 --> 15:45.080
Oh man... my stomach.

15:45.130 --> 15:46.950
Hello, what's that?

15:50.290 --> 15:51.850
It's probably just the flu.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.990
Oh, my burger tastes funny.

15:59.180 --> 16:01.340
Brilliant! Bad meat.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.710
No one's going to want to buy this place now.

16:04.150 --> 16:05.520
Congratulations.

16:06.210 --> 16:09.230
Face it Jackson, you're never going to get the best of me.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.090
Why are you smiling?

16:13.230 --> 16:14.610
Cause I had a hamburger too.

16:17.230 --> 16:21.260
No! No no! Noooo!

16:24.250 --> 16:26.130
(Animal Rescue Foundation)

16:28.110 --> 16:29.630
Hey we're here just in time.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.400
Not a problem, we knew you'd make it.

16:31.980 --> 16:35.990
Oh look! It's a little Lola dog for Lola!

16:36.030 --> 16:38.680
Hello who's the little Lola! Who's the littile

16:38.720 --> 16:40.950
Oh. You're a little leaky Lola.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.230
You know honey I gotta hand it to you.

16:44.380 --> 16:47.180
I didn't think you could do it, but
 you're lookin' pretty good.

16:47.510 --> 16:48.780
Did you get your second win?

16:49.070 --> 16:52.170
Second? I'm about to pop the 
top of win number five!

17:01.730 --> 17:04.770
And this is Trixie. Say hello Trixie.

17:05.569 --> 17:09.010
And there're plenty more just like 
her that need loving homes.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.990
So please, ask your parents,

17:10.990 --> 17:12.900
'cause this is a big responsibility.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.140
Thirty six hours without sleep and

17:15.140 --> 17:16.670
she still hasn't hit the wall yet.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.839
What wall?

17:19.780 --> 17:21.770
Isn't she so cute!

17:23.819 --> 17:25.630
she smells like a puppy dog!

17:26.119 --> 17:28.230
The sweetest darn smell in the world!

17:31.450 --> 17:32.410
That wall.

17:36.290 --> 17:39.640
Just like a tissue! With paws!

17:42.100 --> 17:42.990
You see this!

17:43.570 --> 17:48.630
Half of Matilda's face is brown 
and the other side is white!

17:49.310 --> 17:51.480
And now we move onto the giddy phase.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.620
Brown, white. Brown

17:55.790 --> 17:59.360
And then... if you turn like 
if you turn like this way,

17:59.770 --> 18:02.820
It's like that side is turned 
around and upside down!

18:03.250 --> 18:05.610
It is, really... it's ...

18:07.920 --> 18:10.110
-Does anything come after giddy?  
-Wait for it.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.400
You are so cute. You know 
who should adopt you.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.370
Me! I should!

18:17.510 --> 18:19.540
I should adopt you. You hear that out there people.

18:19.540 --> 18:20.990
You hear that, yeah I'm talking to you.

18:20.990 --> 18:23.640
Don't you even bother calling! 
Do not call this phone!

18:23.700 --> 18:28.060
This dog is mine! Mine, mine, mine, mine!

18:31.190 --> 18:32.530
Come on Matilda.

18:32.530 --> 18:34.260
We're going to talk Daddy into taking you home.

18:34.270 --> 18:36.750
Pull it together pop star you're losing it.

18:39.490 --> 18:43.470
This dog... can talk!

18:45.140 --> 18:46.830
I have a talking dog!

18:49.290 --> 18:50.590
Maybe you should go get her.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.500
I would but it's almost over.

18:52.850 --> 18:53.670
Who's there?

18:55.160 --> 18:56.010
Or 2?

18:56.890 --> 18:59.370
Yes I'm glad you didn't say banana!

19:01.530 --> 19:03.260
This is the funniest dog that you ever...

19:13.040 --> 19:14.370
I had the weirdest dream.

19:14.790 --> 19:18.140
There was this white picket 
fence and a little yard and

19:18.230 --> 19:21.940
a talking dog and, there was
 this camera man that...

19:22.090 --> 19:24.250
(Hannah Howls)

19:24.760 --> 19:25.640
Oh no!

19:26.190 --> 19:28.270
I hit that wall hard this time, didn't I?

19:29.340 --> 19:31.040
Mile, you 'gotta understand.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.360
Even though you sing Super Girl,

19:33.360 --> 19:35.610
doesn't mean you have super powers.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.910
Not even you can do everything.

19:38.650 --> 19:41.730
You just love using your 
song lyrics to make a point,

19:41.730 --> 19:42.340
don't you?

19:42.670 --> 19:45.520
What can I say honey? 
When I'm good I'm good.

19:45.690 --> 19:47.110
When I'm bad...

19:47.920 --> 19:50.210
who am I kidding I'm never bad!

19:50.270 --> 19:52.680
Fourteen number one's! Boo-ya!

19:54.240 --> 19:55.600
Miley, guess what!

19:55.650 --> 19:57.670
Your phone's broken and you 
forgot how to use a doorbell?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.770
No... sorry. OK listen.

20:00.270 --> 20:03.780
Got some good news and I got some bad news.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.750
The good news is, they love the show

20:05.750 --> 20:07.400
and they want to put it on every Sunday.

20:08.630 --> 20:10.560
-Every Sunday? 
-Every Sunday.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.750
That's... well...

20:14.310 --> 20:17.470
Whoa. Well would you look at that.

20:17.570 --> 20:21.270
Spread my butter way too thin and now my toast is dry.

20:22.190 --> 20:24.180
Yep. Not enough to go around.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.970
-Way too thin. Way too thin!  -I get it!

20:28.970 --> 20:29.830
Even I get it.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.730
You do?

20:30.740 --> 20:33.710
Yeah! Your Dad doesn't have enough butter, duh!

20:34.980 --> 20:37.070
You know what, it's not good
 for your heart anyway,

20:37.080 --> 20:39.270
so you should probably try 
honey as a healthy alternative.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.450
Oliver!  I'm the butter.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.840
I spread myself way too thin.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.620
I just... I have too much on my plate.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.180
And I didn't want to disappoint you. I'm...

20:49.210 --> 20:51.090
You know what Miley. No no no no.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.820
It's OK. I understand.

20:55.470 --> 20:57.080
Really? You're OK with it?

20:57.270 --> 21:00.090
You tried and... I appreciate that.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.750
Well... bet I better go tell the station manager.

21:05.900 --> 21:06.820
What was the bad news?

21:06.820 --> 21:08.530
I think we've had enough sadness for one day.

21:08.550 --> 21:09.300
No, really.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.340
They hated you and they only 
wanted me. OK, bye.

21:16.350 --> 21:17.420
What!

21:17.840 --> 21:19.220
Can you believe this!

21:19.250 --> 21:20.060
Very interesting.

21:20.060 --> 21:23.110
Miley on the radio with my lyrics... Superstar!

21:23.190 --> 21:27.410
Miley on the radio without my lyrics... fired! Boo-ya!

21:28.630 --> 21:31.770
Boo-ya, boo-ya, boo-ya! A
 boo-ya, boo-ya, boo-ya!

21:32.640 --> 21:33.900
Fine, boo-ya.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.310
Boo-ya, boo-ya, boo-ya! 
A boo-ya, boo-ya, boo-ya!

21:37.900 --> 21:41.020
Hey there. You're on with Lily... of the Valley.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.240
Hey there. It's Hottie Lamottie

21:44.240 --> 21:45.460
with the swimmer's body.

21:46.350 --> 21:47.240
Yes?

21:47.590 --> 21:51.490
I think you're the grawesomest
 girl at Seaview High!

21:52.340 --> 21:54.950
Oh hottie. You're embarrassing me.

21:55.620 --> 21:56.690
Do go on.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.810
You're all I think about every d...

22:00.570 --> 22:01.640
What are you doing?

22:01.700 --> 22:04.360
I was just... goofing off while
 you were in the bathroom.

22:04.650 --> 22:07.320
I know the radio was on while
 I was in the bathroom.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.480
No... He told me Freebird was on!

22:10.570 --> 22:13.860
I turned that off ten minutes 
ago. You were way more fun.

22:16.060 --> 22:19.830
Howdy everybody! That was me, Miley

22:19.950 --> 22:23.130
pretending to be a pretty girl named Lily.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.100
Possum!
