I’m sorry, Your Honor.
No further questions.

27:27.605 --> 27:30.347
Okay. Bones,
you ready for court?
Yes.

27:30.441 --> 27:34.901

which shows the victim
sustained rib fractures...

27:34.987 --> 27:37.603
as well as a fracture
of the lateral epicondy/e
of the left distal.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.155
What do you say we ease up
on the scientific stuff, okay?

27:40.243 --> 27:43.280
The science gives us
the height of the assailant—

27:43.371 --> 27:45.578
162 centimeters,
Taffet’s height.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.576
That’s— That’s good and all,

27:47.667 --> 27:51.251
but Taffet’s kind of had
a field day trashing the whole
technical “gooble-geek” stuff.

27:51.379 --> 27:55.588
And the jury seemed
to like her for it.
But those are the facts.

27:55.675 --> 28:00.419
It’s how you present the facts
that win or lose a case.

28:00.513 --> 28:05.257
Bones, the jury needs to know
what that little boy went through.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.803

28:09.897 --> 28:13.060
I’ll be fine. We-We should go.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.651
Okay.

28:17.196 --> 28:21.735
Terrence G/lroy’s left greater cornu
of the h yoid was compressed,

28:21.826 --> 28:26.661
indicating that the assailant
strangled the young boy
using only one hand—

28:26.747 --> 28:29.033
the dominant left hand,
in this case.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.958
l’d l/ke to submit
wr/t/ng samples...

28:32.044 --> 28:34.786

is left-handed.

28:34.881 --> 28:38.123
No objection, as long as
it’s also noted that eight percent
of the general population. ..

28:38.217 --> 28:41.380

28:46.642 --> 28:48.894
The victim sustained a fracture...

28:48.978 --> 28:52.266
of the lateral epicondyle
and the shaft...

28:52.356 --> 28:54.472
of the left distal humerus.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.397
Perhaps I can be clearer.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.651
Terrence Gilroy’s bones
could only have been broken...

29:02.742 --> 29:07.657
by someone kneeling on top of him
as they pushed him into the freezer.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.988
The radiating
fracture lines show...

29:10.082 --> 29:14.576
that this assailant had to be
between 125 and 135 pounds—

29:14.670 --> 29:16.126
the weight of the defendant.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.078

/’// make the rulings here.

29:33.648 --> 29:36.811
Overruled. Continue.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.984
Since these broken bones were caused
by the assailant’s knees...

29:40.071 --> 29:44.815
and the ch/pping on
the boy’s kneecaps was caused
by the toes of her heavy boots,

29:44.909 --> 29:47.241
we can determine
the length of her shin.

29:47.328 --> 29:50.695
And what is the significance
of the shin length?

29:50.790 --> 29:52.951
It gives us the height
of the assailant...

29:53.042 --> 29:55.158
which is 5 feet 4 inches,

29:55.252 --> 29:57.288
the same height as the defendant.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.338
it is clear from
the circumstantial evidence
and these facts...

30:00.424 --> 30:04.417
that this child was attacked
with vicious cruelty by Ms. Taffet.

30:04.512 --> 30:07.970
Objection.
The jury makes that determination,
not the witness.

30:08.057 --> 30:10.719
The 5-foot-4 assailant...

30:11.852 --> 30:13.888
crushed the boy’s chest,

30:13.980 --> 30:15.561
choked him...

30:15.648 --> 30:19.687
and finally caused him a torturous death
by burying him alive.

30:19.777 --> 30:22.769
Objection! Speculation.
She can’t know what
the “witness ” felt.

30:22.863 --> 30:25.570
I was buried alive,

30:29.704 --> 30:32.741
which makes me uniquely qualified
to comment on its horror.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.823
Objection, Your Honor!
This is grandstanding.

for Dr. Brennan, Ms. Julian?

No, Your Honor.
I learned everything
I need to know.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.794
Your witness.

30:50.307 --> 30:54.016
Dr. Brennan,
don ’t you think your trauma
as a kidnapping victim...

30:54.103 --> 30:55.843

from being objective?

30:55.938 --> 31:00.853
Objection! She is test/ﬂung
as an expert witness, not a victim.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.479
She brought up
being buried alive.

31:02.570 --> 31:05.903
She did, Ms. Julian. Overruled.

31:05.990 --> 31:09.198

would want to construct facts...

31:09.285 --> 31:11.241
that would give you
some closure and peace.

31:11.328 --> 31:15.162
I resent your implication.
I do not let my emotions
cloud my findings.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.830
No, not intentionally, of course.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.080

- Yes. Sorry.

Dr. Brennan.

Are you currently seeing
an F.B.l. psychologist?

31:32.224 --> 31:35.091
- Yes, but—
- Thank you. No further questions.

No, that has nothing
to do with this case.
My findings are sound.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.387
You may step down, Dr. Brennan.

31:40.483 --> 31:42.815
My findings are sound.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.240
- [ Saroyan ]A dust mite?
- So that little bug is gonna save us?

31:55.331 --> 31:58.073
Oh, don ’t call him a bug.
it sounds Insulting.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.998
We reexamined
the boy’s teeth...

32:00.086 --> 32:03.203
and found it wedged
between the right lateral
incisor and canine.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.913
Dust mites eat
dead human skin cells,

32:06.008 --> 32:07.999
and this one’s stomach sac is full.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.086
[ Saroyan ]
if the boy bit Taffet,
the skin cells are probably hers.

32:11.222 --> 32:15.340
Whate ver’s left is gonna be small,
but there might be enough
to give us D.N.A.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.349
This is
a Dermatophagoides farinae.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.146
For those of us
who don’t speak insect,
what is that exactly?

32:23.234 --> 32:26.397
it’s a dust mite,
an Insect found on clothes.

32:26.487 --> 32:30.526
But it also feeds
on the cells of the person
wearing those clothes.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.823
[ Caroline ]
And where was this
dust mite found?

32:32.910 --> 32:35.071
Between
Terrence Gilroy’s teeth.

32:35.162 --> 32:39.155
it was transferred there
when the boy bit the person
who kidnapped him.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.992
And how do we know that?

32:42.086 --> 32:45.704
The dust mites
contained human female
epithelial cells.

32:45.798 --> 32:50.383
We extracted those cells
and ran them through several
D.N.A. databases.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.380
The cells belong
to Heather Taffet.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.222
Nothin’ further, Your Honor.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.216
Your witness, Ms. Taffet.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.927
It seems that you have
neglected to include...

33:02.022 --> 33:04.934
a sample of the evidence
that I could have tested independently.

33:05.025 --> 33:08.062
Since there were so few cells
in the mite, the testing
destroyed the sample,

33:08.154 --> 33:11.692
but the procedures and results
are all contained
in our documentation.

33:11.782 --> 33:14.194
Let me get this right.

33:14.285 --> 33:17.652
I have access to your notes,
but I can’t examine
the actual evidence...

33:17.746 --> 33:19.657
because you destroyed it?

33:19.748 --> 33:22.364
Your Honor,
in California versus Trombetta,

33:22.501 --> 33:26.289
the Supreme Court ruled
that the prosecution could destroy
a sample to test for DNA.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.336
because there was
no bad faith.

33:28.424 --> 33:32.383
Bad faith? The motives
of every single person
at the Jeffersonian are suspect.

33:32.469 --> 33:36.553

how the evidence will figure

35:31.797 --> 35:35.460
brutally beaten and buried alive
by Heather Taffet.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.588
Taffet was seen
where this child was abducted.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.920
She matches the size
of the assailant.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.721
She is left-handed.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.800
Her voice was discovered
on the ransom tapes.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.976
It all sounds very reasonable,
doesn’t it?

35:48.063 --> 35:50.270
These so-ca/led facts...

35:50.357 --> 35:54.441
were compiled by people
who themselves were victims
of a vicious criminal...

35:54.528 --> 35:56.564
who has not yet been caught.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.861
They need a scapegoat.

35:57.948 --> 36:01.190
But only Heather Taffet
could have the DNA...

36:01.285 --> 36:03.526
that was found
in this child’s mouth.

36:03.620 --> 36:07.829
That evidence
was delivered to us in death
by this brave boy.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.579
And yet the only people
who saw that dust mite,

36:11.670 --> 36:16.505
the only people who touched
the alleged epithelial cells...

36:16.592 --> 36:18.548

39:35.791 --> 39:39.283
.r‘ Always alone ,r‘,r

39:45.926 --> 39:48.338
Yeah!

39:49.638 --> 39:52.380
[Max]
/ was out of town
for a couple of days.

39:52.474 --> 39:55.386
Well, I knew Tempe had
everything under control.
She didn’t need me.

39:55.519 --> 39:58.226
Uh-huh.
Let’s just raise our glasses here.
To the squints, okay?

39:58.313 --> 40:00.224
To Booth!
And Caroline.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.853
Hear! Hear!
I never doubted any of you,
not for a minute.

40:03.986 --> 40:05.567
[Booth]
Where ’d you come from, huh?
Come on!

40:08.198 --> 40:11.565
Let’s not forget
the happy couple.
Over here.

40:11.660 --> 40:15.869
Yes, best wishes
for a successful blending
of familial obi/gations. ..

40:15.956 --> 40:19.540
as well as monetary
and property conso/rdation.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.713
What?

40:23.797 --> 40:26.914
[ Cheering ]

40:27.009 --> 40:29.500
[ Laughing ]
Congratulations!

40:29.595 --> 40:32.007
[ Laughing Continues]

40:34.683 --> 40:37.174
[Sighs]
I guess I’ll go home.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.555
A real bed is probably
gonna feel good.

40:39.646 --> 40:42.729
I’m sorry that I, uh—
that I doubted you.

40:42.816 --> 40:46.104
Sweets would say that, subconsciously,
you wanted Booth to catch you...

40:46.194 --> 40:49.652
so you and I wouldn’t
have to be separated again.

40:52.034 --> 40:55.822
Smart guy that Sweets.
I love you, honey.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.574
Thanks for leaving me
with the bill again.
That’s nice of you.

40:58.665 --> 41:01.577
It’s your fault, Booth.
My wallet got stolen in jail.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.910
Bye.
I can’t believe they
actually got hitched.

41:05.047 --> 41:07.379
[Brennan ] / know.
[ Hodgins ]
Thank you, guys.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.377
Thank you.

41:09.468 --> 41:12.801
l have the sense
that everything’s
changing, Booth.

41:12.888 --> 41:17.882
Not everything.
Look, we’re still partners, right?

41:17.976 --> 41:21.844
And Taffet, she’s put away.
I mean, you’re feeling good
about that, right?

41:21.938 --> 41:24.554
You almost died, Booth.
That could happen again.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.524
What if next time
I can’t get to you?
It’s not gonna happen again.

41:29.112 --> 41:31.023
I envy your ability...

41:31.114 --> 41:34.732
to substitute optimism for reality.

41:34.826 --> 41:38.284
You know what?
Maybe you just need to
take some time off—

41:38.372 --> 41:40.613
go to a beach,
lay in the sun.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.412
I might need more
than a little time.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.705
Don’t make any decisions
about your future right now.
I’m just saying—

41:49.800 --> 41:51.665
You know when a dentist
gives you anesthetic...

41:51.760 --> 41:54.001
and tells you not to operate
any heavy machinery...

41:54.096 --> 41:56.633
or make any
important decisions
within 24 hours?

41:56.723 --> 42:00.056
All right, this case was bigger
than a root canal.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.759
Let’s just go back inside
and have one more drink
for the road.

42:02.896 --> 42:06.013
Come on, just one.
I’m tired, Booth.
l-l’m gonna go home.

42:06.108 --> 42:09.020
[ Sighs ]
All right. Come on.
Let’s get you in the cab.

42:09.111 --> 42:12.478
I know.
It’s— It’s been a long, long day.

42:12.572 --> 42:15.109
Come on, get in there. All right?

42:15.200 --> 42:16.815
Hey, I’ll see you tomorrow, right?

43:13.967 --> 43:15.332
What’s that mean?

43:17.262 --> 43:18.251
