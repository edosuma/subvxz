WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.761
You are the Weakest Link.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.261
This isnâ€™t just a game.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.595
There's something else going on.

00:10.677 --> 00:14.056
- We have contestants outside of the games.
- The games continue.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.683
This is Satellite Five.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.986
10,000 channels.
All beaming down from here.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.483
My Masters,
they fear the Doctor.

00:20.562 --> 00:21.734
Tell me, who are they?

00:23.232 --> 00:24.950
I saw you die!

00:25.192 --> 00:27.160
That's impossible.
7' he y were destroyed.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.453
Obviously they survived.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.748
We have your associate.

00:30.822 --> 00:34.702
You will obey or she will be exterminated.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.332
- Rose?
- Yes, Doctor.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.126
I'm coming to get you.

01:17.953 --> 01:21.708
You know the Doctor.
You understand him.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.590
- You will predict his actions.
- I don't know!

01:26.253 --> 01:30.633
- And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
- Predict! Predict! Predict!

01:30.799 --> 01:33.894
Tardis detected in flight.

01:33.969 --> 01:37.064
Launch missiles! Exterminate!
- You can't!

01:37.347 --> 01:39.691
The Tardis hasn't got any defences.
You're gonna kill him.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.982
You have predicted correctly.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.234
We've got incoming!

01:57.868 --> 02:01.498
The extrapolator's working.
We've got a fully functional force-field.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.671
- Try saying that when you're drunk.
- And for my next trick...

02:28.899 --> 02:30.776
Rose, get down!

02:31.401 --> 02:34.154
- Get down, Rose!
- Exterminate!

02:41.953 --> 02:43.375
You did it.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.757
Feels like I haven't seen
you in years.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.338
I told you I'd come
and get you.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.469
- Never doubted it.
- I did. You all right?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.301
- Yeah. And you?
- Not bad. Been better.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.353
- Don't I get a hug?
- Oh, come here.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.102
I was talking to him.
Welcome home.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.859
Oh! I thought I'd
never see you again.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.232
You were lucky,
that was just a one-shot wonder.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.406
Drained the gun of all its power supply.
Now it's just a piece of junk.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.486
Patience, my brethren.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.034
You said they were extinct.
How come they're still alive?

03:17.114 --> 03:19.275
One minute they're the greatest
threat in the universe,

03:19.282 --> 03:21.410
the next minute
they vanished out of time and space.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.537
They went off to
fight a bigger war.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.798
The Time War.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.252
- I thought that was just a legend.
- I was there.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.429
The war between the Daleks
and the Time Lords,

03:32.504 --> 03:34.757
with the whole of
creation at stake.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.889
My people were destroyed
but they took the Daleks with them.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.562
I almost thought
it was worth it.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.607
And now it turns out
they died for nothing.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.857
There's thousands of them now.
We could hardly stop one.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.613
What are we gonna do?

03:51.106 --> 03:54.827
No good stood round here chinwagging.
Human race, you'd gossip all day.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.705
The Daleks have got the answers.
Let's go and meet the neighbours.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.781
You can't go out there!

04:01.116 --> 04:04.620
- Exterminate!
- Exterminate!

04:08.331 --> 04:12.427
Is that it?
Useless. Nul points!

04:13.253 --> 04:16.223
It's all right, come on out.
That force-field can hold back anything.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.971
Almost anything.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.428
Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that.
Thanks.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.762
Sorry.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.565
Do you know what they call me in
the ancient legends of the Dalek homeworld?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.317
The Oncoming Storm.

04:32.731 --> 04:37.407
You might have removed all your emotions,
but I reckon right down deep in your DNA,

04:37.486 --> 04:41.912
there's one little spark left.
And that's fear.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.378
Doesn't it just burn when you face me?

04:48.830 --> 04:52.710
So tell me,
how did you survive the Time War?

04:52.918 --> 04:56.297
They survived through me.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.613
Rose. Captain.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.276
This is the Emperor of the Daleks.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.696
You destroyed us, Doctor.

05:20.779 --> 05:24.283
The Dalek race
died in your inferno.

05:24.366 --> 05:28.963
But my ship survived
falling through time,

05:29.037 --> 05:31.836
crippled but alive.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.134
- I get it...
- Do not interrupt!

05:34.209 --> 05:37.713
- Do not interrupt!
- Do not interrupt!

05:37.796 --> 05:39.890
I think you're
forgetting something.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.969
I'm the Doctor and if there's
one thing I can do, it's talk.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.726
I've got five billion languages
and you haven't got one way of stopping me.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.433
So if anybody's
gonna shut up, it's you!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.479
Okie-doke. So, where were we?

05:54.020 --> 05:58.321
We waited here,
in the dark space,

05:58.400 --> 06:01.574
damaged but rebuilding.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.160
Centuries passed

06:04.239 --> 06:09.291
and we quietly infiltrated
the systems of Earth,

06:09.369 --> 06:12.669
harvesting the waste of humanity.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.501
The prisoner; the refugee;

06:15.584 --> 06:19.384
the dispossessed
they all came to us.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.717
The bodies were filleted
pulped sifted.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.229
The seed of
the human race is perverted.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.901
Only one cell in a billion
was fit to be nurtured.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.608
So you created an army of Daleks
out of the dead.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.816
That makes them half human.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.199
Those words are blasphemy!

06:42.360 --> 06:46.285
- Do not blaspheme!
- Do not blaspheme!

06:46.364 --> 06:48.207
Do not blaspheme!

06:48.283 --> 06:52.208
Everything human
has been purged.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.210
I cultivated

06:54.289 --> 06:57.793
pure and blessed Dalek

07:01.671 --> 07:04.720
Since when did the Daleks
have a concept of blasphemy?

07:04.799 --> 07:09.726
I reached into
the dirt and made new life.

07:09.804 --> 07:14.105
I am the God of all Daleks!

07:14.184 --> 07:16.607
- Wars/up him!
- Wars/up him!

07:16.686 --> 07:18.029
Worship him!

07:18.521 --> 07:20.068
They're insane.

07:20.941 --> 07:25.196
Hiding in silence for hundreds of years,
that's enough to drive anyone mad.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.535
But it's worse than that.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.164
Driven mad by your own flesh.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.547
The stink of humanity.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.678
You hate your own existence.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.930
And that makes them
more deadly than ever.

07:48.635 --> 07:53.106
- We're going.
- You may not leave my presence!

07:53.181 --> 07:57.152
- Stay where you are!
- Exterminate!

07:57.352 --> 08:01.698
- Exterminate!
- Exterminate!

08:02.148 --> 08:04.742
- Exterminate!
- Exterminate!

08:05.276 --> 08:08.029
- Wars/up him!
- Wars/up him!

08:09.739 --> 08:12.583
You will be - Exterminated!

08:20.834 --> 08:25.135
Turn everything up! All transmitters,
full power, wide open, now! Do it!

08:25.213 --> 08:26.260
What does this do?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.807
Stops the Daleks
from transmatting on board.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.350
How did you get on?
Did you contact Earth?

08:29.426 --> 08:31.554
I tried to warn them,
but all they did was suspend our license

08:31.636 --> 08:33.808
'cause we stopped the programmes.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.607
And the planet's just sitting there.
Defenceless.

08:36.765 --> 08:40.861
Lynda, what are you still doing on board?
I told you to evacuate everyone!

08:40.937 --> 08:43.235
- She wouldn't go.
- I didn't wanna leave you.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.448
There weren't enough shuttles anyway
or I wouldn't be here.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.780
We've got about 100 people
stranded on Floor Zero.

08:50.030 --> 08:54.251
Listen, my name's Rodrick.
I won the game, where's my money?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.454
Is anyone listening?
Where's my money?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.835
Oh, my God.
The Fleet is moving.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.291
They're on their way!

09:06.921 --> 09:09.800
Purify the Earth with fire.

09:10.091 --> 09:14.813
The planet will become my temple
and we shall rise.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.189
This will be our paradise!

09:27.734 --> 09:30.453
Dalek plan, big mistake,
'cause what've they left me with?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.327
Anyone? Anyone?
Come on, it's obvious!

09:33.698 --> 09:36.292
A great big transmitter.
This station!

09:36.367 --> 09:39.587
If I can change the signal,
fold it back, sequence it? Anyone?

09:39.662 --> 09:42.085
- You've got to be kidding.
- Give the man a medal!

09:42.165 --> 09:44.384
- A Delta Wave?
- A Delta Wave!

09:44.459 --> 09:47.178
- What's a Delta Wave?
- A wave of Van Cassadyne energy.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.630
It fries your brain.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.307
Stand in the way of a Delta Wave
and your head gets barbecued.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.727
And this place can transmit a massive wave.
Wipe out the Daleks!

09:54.803 --> 09:56.646
Get started and do it, then!

09:56.721 --> 09:59.600
Trouble is, wave this size,
building this big, brain as clever as mine,

09:59.682 --> 10:01.480
should take about three days.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.813
- How long till the Fleet arrive?
- 22 minutes.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.871
We've now got a force-field,
so they can't blast us out of the sky.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.457
But that doesn't stop
the Daleks from physically invading.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.666
Do they know about
the Delta Wave?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.093
They'll have worked
it out at the same time.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.136
So, they want to stop the Doctor.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.214
That means they've got to get
to this level, 500.

10:31.297 --> 10:36.349
Now, I can concentrate the extrapolator
on the top six levels, 500 to 495.

10:36.678 --> 10:40.728
So they'll penetrate the station below that
at level 494 and fight their way up.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.059
- Who are they fighting?
- Us.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.644
What are we fighting with?

10:43.726 --> 10:47.230
The guards had guns with bastic bullets,
that's enough to blow a Dalek wide open.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.860
There's five of us.

10:48.940 --> 10:52.069
Rose, you can help me.
I need all these wires stripping bare.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.780
- Right, now there's four of us.
- Then let's move it!

10:54.863 --> 10:57.662
Into the lift,
isolate the lift controls.

11:00.994 --> 11:05.545
I just wanna say... thanks,
I suppose.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.923
- And I'll do my best.
- Me, too.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.318
It's been fun.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.198
- But I guess this is goodbye.
- Don't talk like that.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.034
The Doctor's gonna do it,
you just watch him.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.406
Rose.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.374
You are worth fighting for.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.589
Wish I'd never met you, Doctor.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.884
I was much better
off as a coward.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.342
See you in hell.

12:00.386 --> 12:04.482
He's gonna be all right,
isn't he?

12:15.568 --> 12:19.914
One last time!
Any more volunteers?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.998
There's an army about
to invade this station.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.967
I need every last
citizen to mount a defence.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.509
Don't listen to him!
There aren't any Daleks.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.261
They disappeared
thousands of years ago.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.138
Thanks.
As for the rest of you,

12:42.262 --> 12:46.813
the Daleks will enter the station at
Floor 494, and as far as I can tell,

12:46.891 --> 12:50.941
they'll head up, not down.
But that's not a promise.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.111
So here's a few
words of advice.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.034
Keep quiet.

12:57.443 --> 13:01.243
And if you hear fighting up above,
if you hear us dying...

13:03.116 --> 13:06.165
then tell me that
the Daleks aren't real.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.758
Don't make a sound.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.345
Let's go.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.770
Suppose...

13:36.024 --> 13:38.197
- What?
- Nothing.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.951
- You said suppose.
- No, I was just thinking.

13:43.031 --> 13:47.207
I mean, obviously you can't,
but you've got a time machine.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.206
Why can't you just go back to last week
and warn them?

13:50.288 --> 13:53.588
Soon as the Tardis lands, in that second,
I become part of events.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.918
Stuck in the timeline.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.550
Yeah, I thought it'd
be something like that.

13:59.130 --> 14:04.352
There's another thing the Tardis could do.
It could take us away. We could leave.

14:05.011 --> 14:09.482
Let history take its course.
We go to Marbella in 1989.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.152
- Yeah, but you'd never do that.
- No, but you could ask.

14:14.645 --> 14:19.276
- Never even occurred to you, did it?
- Well, I'm just too good.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.750
The Delta Wave's started building.
How long does it need?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.343
Is that bad?

14:37.418 --> 14:39.921
Okay, it's bad. How bad is it?

14:41.881 --> 14:45.351
Rose Tyler, you're a genius!
We can do it!

14:45.426 --> 14:48.805
If I use the Tardis to cross
my own timeline... Yes!

14:56.270 --> 14:57.772
Hold that down
and keep position.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.335
- What's it do?
- Cancels the buffers.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.534
If I'm very clever,
and I'm more than clever, I'm brilliant,

15:01.609 --> 15:04.112
I might just save the world.
Or rip it apart.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.675
- I'd go for the first one.
- Me, too.

15:05.696 --> 15:09.075
Now, I've just got to go and power up
the Game Station. Hold on!

15:33.224 --> 15:37.775
Doctor, what are you doing?
Can I take my hand off? It's moving.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.818
Doctor, let me out!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.324
Let me out!

15:46.404 --> 15:48.406
Doctor, what have you done?

16:06.883 --> 16:09.102
This is Emergency Program One.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.847
Rose, now listen,
this is important

16:11.929 --> 16:15.684
If this message is activated
then it can only mean one thing.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.687
We must be in danger.
And I mean fatal.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.110
I'm dead or about to die any second
with no chance of escape.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.488
- No!
- And that's okay. Hope it's a good death.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.488
But I promised to look after you
and that's what I'm doing.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.369
- The Tardis is taking you home.
- I won't let you!

16:30.448 --> 16:32.746
And I bet you're fussing and moaning now.
Typical!

16:32.825 --> 16:35.123
But hold an and
just listen a bit more.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.958
The Tardis can never return for me.
Emergency Program One means

16:39.040 --> 16:42.670
I'm facing an enemy that should never
get their hands on this machine.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.427
So this is what you should do,
let the Tardis die.

16:46.839 --> 16:51.561
Just let' this old box gather dust. No one
can open it, no one will even notice it.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.564
Let it became a strange little thing
standing on a street corner.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.110
And over the years the world will move on
and the box will be buried.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.821
And if you want to remember me,
then you can do one thing.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.240
That's all. One thing.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.778
Have a good life.

17:11.614 --> 17:15.710
Do that far me, Rose.
Have a fantastic life.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.462
You can't do this to me.
You can't.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.388
Take me back! Take me back!

17:32.468 --> 17:33.720
No!

17:49.610 --> 17:53.035
Come on, fly. How do you fly?

17:54.699 --> 17:56.372
Come on, help me!

18:13.467 --> 18:15.185
I knew it!

18:15.261 --> 18:18.231
I was all the way down Clifton Parade
and I heard the engines.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.768
I thought, "There's only one thing
that makes a noise like that."

18:23.019 --> 18:24.521
What is it?

18:31.485 --> 18:34.079
Rose, I've called up
the internal laser codes.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.617
There should be a different number on
every screen. Can you read them out to me?

18:37.700 --> 18:40.249
- She's not here.
- Of all the times to take a leak!

18:40.328 --> 18:42.330
When she gets back,
tell her to read me the codes.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.838
- She's not coming back.
- What do you mean? Where did she go?

18:46.042 --> 18:49.262
- Just get on with your work.
- You took her home, didn't you?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.721
Yeah.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.430
The Delta Wave.
Is it ever gonna be ready?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.854
Tell him the truth, Doctor.

18:58.179 --> 19:02.275
There is every
possibility the Delta Wave

19:02.350 --> 19:07.607
could be complete
but no possibility of refining it.

19:07.897 --> 19:13.074
The Delta Wave must kill
every living thing in its path,

19:13.527 --> 19:18.374
with no distinction
between human and Dalek.

19:18.449 --> 19:23.706
All things will die.
By your hand.

19:24.914 --> 19:29.090
Doctor, the range of this transmitter
covers the entire Earth.

19:29.210 --> 19:33.681
You would destroy
Dale/(s and humans together.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.935
If I am God

19:38.010 --> 19:40.854
the creator of all thing;

19:40.971 --> 19:44.771
then what does
that make you, Doctor?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.648
There are colonies out there.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.071
The human race would survive in
some shape or form.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.569
But you're the only
Daleks in existence.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.535
The whole universe is in danger
if I let you live.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.331
Do you see, jack?

19:59.407 --> 20:02.502
That's the decision I've got to make
for every living thing.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.001
Die as a human or
live as a Dalek.

20:07.498 --> 20:12.004
- What would you do?
- You sent her home. She's safe.

20:12.336 --> 20:16.307
- Keep working.
- But he will exterminate you!

20:16.465 --> 20:19.059
Never doubted him, never will.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.896
Now, you tell me,
God of all Daleks,

20:21.971 --> 20:26.101
'cause there's one thing I never worked out.
The words, "Bad Wolf",

20:26.308 --> 20:29.903
spread across time and space,
everywhere, drawing me in.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.700
- How did you manage that?
- I did nothing.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.611
Come on, there's no secrets now,
Your Worship.

20:36.694 --> 20:40.449
They are not pan' of my design.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.870
This is the truth of God.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.386
And it's gone
upmarket, this place.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.510
They're doing little tubs
of coleslaw now.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.093
It's not very nice.
It tastes a bit sort of clinical.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.513
Have you tried that new pizza place
on Minto Road?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.810
- What's it selling?
- Pizza.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.561
- That's nice. Do they deliver?
- Yeah.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.906
Oh, Rose, have something to eat.

21:13.981 --> 21:18.908
200,000 years in the future he's dying
and there's nothing I can do.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.331
Like you said,
200,000 years, it's way off.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.454
But it's not, it's now.

21:24.533 --> 21:28.879
That fight is happening right now.
And he's fighting for us!

21:28.954 --> 21:32.128
For the whole planet!
And I'm just sitting here eating chips!

21:32.458 --> 21:35.302
Listen to me.
God knows I've hated that man,

21:35.377 --> 21:38.347
but right now I love him
and do you know why?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.681
'Cause he did the right thing.
He sent you back to me.

21:44.220 --> 21:48.521
What do I do every day, Mum?
What do I do?

21:49.058 --> 21:53.029
Get up, catch the bus,
go to work, come back home,

21:53.229 --> 21:55.527
eat chips and go to bed,
is that it?

21:55.606 --> 21:56.766
That's what the rest of us do.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.776
- I can't.
- Why, 'cause you're better than us?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.861
No, I didn't mean that!

22:05.032 --> 22:06.659
But it was...

22:08.702 --> 22:10.796
It was a better life.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.216
I don't mean all
the travelling and...

22:15.626 --> 22:19.506
seeing aliens and spaceships
and things, that don't matter.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.764
The Doctor showed me
a better way of living your life.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.813
You know he showed you, too.

22:29.014 --> 22:33.110
That you don't just give up.
You don't just let things happen.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.814
You make a stand. You say no.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.276
You have the guts to do what's right
when everyone else just runs away!

22:40.401 --> 22:42.278
And I just can't...

22:45.823 --> 22:47.700
Right, Lynda,
you are my eyes and ears.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.083
When the Daleks get in, you can follow them
on that screen and report it to me.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.629
- Understood.
- They'll detect you.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.226
The door is made of hydra combination,
it should keep them out.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.134
- Should?
- It's the best I can do.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.552
How long till the Fleet arrives?

22:58.669 --> 23:00.296
They accelerated.

23:05.009 --> 23:08.388
This is it!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.262
You can't spend the rest of your life
thinking about the Doctor.

23:45.466 --> 23:49.437
- But how do I forget him?
- You've got to start living your own life.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.189
A proper life.
Like the kind he's never had.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.858
The sort of life that you
could have with me.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.961
Over here,
it's over here as well!

24:21.085 --> 24:24.635
That's been there for years.
It's just a phrase, it's just words!

24:24.922 --> 24:27.971
I thought it was a warning.
Maybe it's the opposite.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.144
Maybe it's a message.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.723
The same words written down now
and 200,000 years in the future.

24:33.806 --> 24:37.936
It's a link between me and the Doctor.
Bad Wolf here, Bad Wolf there.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.861
Yeah, but if it's a message,
what's it saying?

24:39.979 --> 24:43.609
It's telling me I can get back.
The least I can do is help him escape!

24:45.442 --> 24:50.323
Stand your ground, everyone.
Follow my commands. And good luck.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.628
You were right.
They're forcing the air lock on 494.

25:14.930 --> 25:18.560
All the Tardis needs to do is
make a return trip. just reverse.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.235
Yeah, but we still can't do it.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.312
The Doctor always said
the Tardis was telepathic.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.444
This thing is alive, it can listen.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.697
- It's not listening now, is it?
- We need to get inside it.

25:27.860 --> 25:31.660
Last time I saw you, with the Slitheen,
this middle bit opened.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.997
And there was this light

25:33.115 --> 25:35.163
and the Doctor said
it was the heart of the Tardis.

25:35.242 --> 25:39.213
If we can open it, I can make contact.
I can tell it what to do.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.708
Rose, if you go back,
you're gonna die.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.634
That's a risk I've got to take.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.176
'Cause there's
nothing left for me here.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.007
- Nothing?
- No.

25:51.842 --> 25:55.517
Okay, if that's what you think,
let's get this thing open.

26:10.110 --> 26:13.740
Okay, activate internal lasers.
Slice them up.

26:14.865 --> 26:17.994
Defences have gone offline.
The Daleks have overridden the lot.

26:38.514 --> 26:42.769
You lied to me!
The bullets don't work!

27:01.662 --> 27:03.130
Faster!

27:08.961 --> 27:10.213
Come on!

27:11.380 --> 27:13.007
It's not moving!

27:28.480 --> 27:30.653
Advance guard
have made it to 495.

27:30.774 --> 27:35.200
- Jack, how are we doing?
- 495 should be good. I like 495.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.251
Identify yourself

27:40.742 --> 27:42.961
You are the Weakest Link.
Goodbye!

27:45.914 --> 27:47.040
Yes!

27:48.417 --> 27:50.044
You are the Weakest Link...

27:53.005 --> 27:54.882
Goodbye.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.185
Proceed to next level.

27:59.970 --> 28:04.225
They're flying up the ventilation shafts.
No, wait a minute.

28:04.391 --> 28:07.315
Oh, my God. Why are they doing that?
They're going down.

28:16.069 --> 28:19.699
Exterminate! Exterminate...

28:23.076 --> 28:25.795
Exterminate! Exterminate!

28:27.748 --> 28:30.672
You can't! You don't exist!

28:31.418 --> 28:36.265
It's not fair! I won the game!
I should be rich!

28:36.340 --> 28:40.095
- I'm a winner! You can't do this to me!
- Exterminate!

28:52.606 --> 28:55.610
Floor Zero.
They killed them all.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.706
It was never gonna work, sweetheart.

29:00.781 --> 29:04.411
And the Doctor knew that.
He just wanted you to be safe.

29:04.493 --> 29:08.623
- I can't give up.
- Lock the door. Walk away.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.051
- Dad wouldn't give up.
- He's not here, is he?

29:13.835 --> 29:17.385
- And even if he was, he'd say the same.
- No, he wouldn't.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.642
He'd tell me to try anything.

29:21.343 --> 29:25.189
If I could save the Doctor's
life, try anything.

29:25.264 --> 29:29.565
- We're never gonna know.
- Well, I know. 'Cause I met him.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.987
- I met Dad.
- Don't be ridiculous.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.745
The Doctor took me back in time
and I met Dad.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.037
Don't say that.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.619
You remember when Dad died,
there was someone with him?

29:47.286 --> 29:51.166
A girl, a blonde girl.
She held his hand.

29:55.127 --> 29:59.303
You saw her from a distance,
Mum, you saw her.

29:59.589 --> 30:03.685
Think about it.
That was me. You saw me.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.683
- Stop it!
- That's how good the Doctor...

30:05.846 --> 30:08.144
Stop it! just stop it!

30:25.032 --> 30:28.878
- Lynda, what's happening on Earth?
- The Fleet's descending.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.748
They're bombing whole continents.

30:32.914 --> 30:37.545
Europa, Pacifica,
the New American Alliance.

30:39.379 --> 30:43.509
Australasia's just, er... gone.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.262
This is perfect/on.

30:46.345 --> 30:50.521
I have created heaven on Earth.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.812
Floor 499, we're the last defence.

30:54.936 --> 30:58.566
The bullets should work if you concentrate
them on the Daleks' eyestalk.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.363
I've got the force-field at maximum,

31:00.442 --> 31:03.412
so Dalek firepower
should be at its weakest.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.953
I'm only here 'cause of you.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.623
I joined the Program
'cause you were on it.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.086
Am I supposed to say,
"When this is all over,"

31:12.162 --> 31:14.415
"if we're still alive,
maybe we could go for a drink?"

31:14.498 --> 31:17.172
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah, well, tough.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.391
There's gotta be
something else we can do.

31:28.762 --> 31:32.608
Mum was right. Maybe we should
just lock the door and walk away.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.101
I'm not having that.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.609
I'm not having you
just give up now, no way.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.693
We just need something
stronger than my car.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.911
Something bigger,
something like that.

31:57.666 --> 32:01.011
Right, you've only got this until 6:00,
so get on with it.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.340
- Mum, where the hell did you get that from?
- Rodrigo. He owes me a favour.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.427
Never mind why. But you were right
about your dad, sweetheart.

32:07.801 --> 32:11.772
He was full of mad ideas
and it's exactly what he would have done.

32:12.639 --> 32:15.062
Now, get on with it
before I change my mind.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.493
Open fire!

32:51.595 --> 32:53.438
It's not working!

32:53.513 --> 32:57.484
Concentrate your fire.
Eyestalk 2:00!

33:04.858 --> 33:08.988
Eye vision is impaired!
I cannot see!

33:09.696 --> 33:11.198
We did it!

33:14.201 --> 33:17.080
No. No!

33:21.833 --> 33:23.710
I've got a problem.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.345
Human female detected.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.561
- They've found me.
- You'll be all right, Lynda.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.151
That side of the station's
reinforced against meteors.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.895
Hope so.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.481
You know what they say
about Earth workmanship.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.380
Last man standing!

34:42.455 --> 34:46.926
For God's sake, Doctor,
finish that thing and kill them!

34:47.418 --> 34:52.266
Finish that thing
and kit! mankind.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.826
- Keep going!
- Put your foot down!

35:14.487 --> 35:18.037
- Faster!
- Give it some more, Mickey!

35:21.369 --> 35:22.837
Keep going!

35:24.331 --> 35:26.049
Come on! Come on!

35:27.000 --> 35:29.844
- Keep going!
- Give it some more!

35:44.684 --> 35:45.936
Rose!

36:06.748 --> 36:09.376
Doctor! You've got
20 seconds maximum.

36:46.496 --> 36:50.376
- Exterminate!
- I kind of figured that.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.679
It's ready!

37:13.064 --> 37:15.283
You really wanna
think about this.

37:15.608 --> 37:19.704
'Cause if I activate the signal,
every living creature dies.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.248
I am immortal.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.124
Do you wanna put that
to the test?

37:24.200 --> 37:28.330
I want to see you
become like me.

37:28.830 --> 37:34.052
Hail the Doctor,
the Great Exterminator.

37:34.169 --> 37:37.764
- I'll do it!
- Then prove yourself Doctor!

37:37.964 --> 37:41.594
What are you?
Coward or killer?

37:52.687 --> 37:54.360
Coward

37:54.481 --> 37:55.983
Any day-

37:56.065 --> 38:01.287
Mankind will be harvested
because of your weakness.

38:02.322 --> 38:06.748
And what about me?
Am I becoming one of your angels?

38:06.951 --> 38:09.374
You are the heathen.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.584
You will be exterminated.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.174
Maybe it's time.

38:26.513 --> 38:29.767
Alert! Tardis materialising!

38:30.225 --> 38:32.478
You will not escape!

38:45.323 --> 38:48.202
- What have you done?
- I looked into the Tardis.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.420
And the Tardis looked into me.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.749
You looked into the time vortex.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.875
Rose, no one's meant to see that.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.088
This is the Abomination!

38:59.170 --> 39:01.047
Exterminate!

39:07.387 --> 39:11.392
I am the Bad Wolf.
I create myself.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.271
I take the words...

39:18.273 --> 39:22.119
I scatter them
in time and space.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.990
A message to lead myself here.

39:27.699 --> 39:31.875
Rose, you've got to stop this!
You've got to stop this now!

39:34.038 --> 39:38.214
You've got the entire vortex running
through your head. You're gonna burn!

39:39.168 --> 39:40.886
I want you safe.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.598
My Doctor.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.176
Protected from the false god.

39:47.260 --> 39:51.766
You cannot hurt me!
I am immortal!

39:52.891 --> 39:54.689
You are tiny.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.567
I can see the whole
of time and space.

39:58.688 --> 40:02.693
Every single atom of your existence
and I divide them.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.493
Everything must come to dust.

40:14.871 --> 40:18.421
All things. Everything dies.

40:26.049 --> 40:30.600
- The Time War ends.
- I will not die!

40:32.180 --> 40:35.935
I cannot die!

40:53.284 --> 40:55.378
Rose, you've done it, now stop.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.206
Just let go!

40:59.624 --> 41:01.672
How can I let go of this?

41:02.877 --> 41:04.675
I bring life.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.224
But this is wrong!

41:08.675 --> 41:11.804
- You can't control life and death!
- But I can.

41:13.721 --> 41:18.522
The sun and the moon,
the day and night.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.859
But why do they hurt?

41:22.063 --> 41:24.782
The power's gonna kill you.
And it's my fault!

41:25.817 --> 41:27.740
I can see everything.

41:29.570 --> 41:33.120
All that is, all that was.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.544
All that ever could be.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.213
That's what I see.
All the time.

41:43.001 --> 41:47.177
- And doesn't it drive you mad?
- My head.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.804
- Come here.
- It's killing me.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.307
I think you need a doctor.

43:41.494 --> 43:44.668
- What happened?
- Don't you remember?

43:47.208 --> 43:48.926
It's like...

43:49.585 --> 43:51.007
There was this singing.

43:51.129 --> 43:54.258
That's right, I sang a song
and the Daleks ran away.

43:54.340 --> 43:59.062
I was at home.
No, I wasn't. I was in the Tardis and...

44:00.513 --> 44:02.265
there was this light.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.810
I can't remember anything else.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.572
Rose Tyler.

44:16.404 --> 44:20.534
I was gonna take you to so many places.
Barcelona, not the city Barcelona,

44:20.700 --> 44:22.498
the planet Barcelona,
you'd love it.

44:22.577 --> 44:25.581
Fantastic place.
They've got dogs with no noses.

44:27.498 --> 44:31.002
Imagine how many times a day you end up
telling that joke and it's still funny!

44:31.085 --> 44:32.712
Then why can't we go?

44:32.795 --> 44:36.345
Maybe you will, and maybe I will,
but not like this.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.390
You're not making sense.

44:39.468 --> 44:42.438
I might never make sense again.
I might have two heads or no head!

44:43.181 --> 44:46.401
Imagine me with no head.
And don't say that's an improvement!

44:47.351 --> 44:49.820
But it's a bit dodgy this process.

44:51.230 --> 44:53.528
You never know
what you're gonna end up with.

44:53.983 --> 44:56.031
- Doctor!
- Stay away!

44:57.904 --> 44:59.451
Doctor,
tell me what's going on.

44:59.572 --> 45:03.372
I absorbed all the energy of the time
vortex and no one's meant to do that.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.291
Every cell in my body is dying.

45:11.125 --> 45:14.299
- Can't you do something?
- Yeah, I'm doing it now!

45:14.921 --> 45:19.518
Time Lords have this little trick.
It's sort of a way of cheating death.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.513
Except...

45:26.098 --> 45:27.896
it means I'm gonna change...

45:30.811 --> 45:32.813
and I'm not
gonna see you again.

45:34.190 --> 45:37.364
Not like this,
not with this daft old face.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.535
- And before I go...
- Don't say that!

45:41.614 --> 45:42.831
Rose...

45:45.076 --> 45:48.546
before I go I just wanna tell you,
you were fantastic.

45:50.498 --> 45:52.250
Absolutely fantastic.

45:55.419 --> 45:57.046
And do you know what?

46:00.383 --> 46:01.851
So was I.

46:23.531 --> 46:25.283
Hello, okay.

46:28.786 --> 46:32.040
New teeth, that's weird.
So, where was I?

46:32.498 --> 46:35.251
Oh, that's right, Barcelona!
