It's been 14 years.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.755
I went to your funeral.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.132
Look, that fire,
it wasn't an accident.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.464
Someone was out
to get me,

01:39.558 --> 01:44.018

assumed I was dead,
so I ran.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.058

01:47.149 --> 01:50.016
Well, she’s got an angel

She was adopted by
a nice family here in Texas.

She's beautiful.

Maybe one day she'll
run for Congress.

The timing of your call
two weeks before my election,

Oh, she'll be fine.

02:59.597 --> 03:02.509
She needs a little rest,
little time to recover.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.556
Recover from what?

03:04.643 --> 03:08.636
She had an appointment
with a neurologist,
who ran some tests.

03:08.773 --> 03:09.933
What kind of tests?

03:10.024 --> 03:12.310
Your mother's been
having some headaches.

I'd like to take
a DNA sample.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.214
From me? Okay, sure.

35:58.532 --> 35:59.897
Of course.

36:06.457 --> 36:08.994
ljust swab it
on the inside of my cheek?

36:09.084 --> 36:10.585
Yes, that's right.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.264
Here you go.
DNA sample.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.102
Thank you.

36:36.403 --> 36:40.567
You know, you should be
careful who you talk to
about this ability, Zane.

36:41.492 --> 36:43.448
There are some people
who might not understand,

36:43.535 --> 36:45.526
who would want to hurt you.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.452
Why would anybody
want to hurt me?

36:48.082 --> 36:50.539
I don't know yet,
but I do know this.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.875
There are others out there,
like you.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.828
Really? How many others?

36:56.131 --> 36:58.417
Dozens, and those are
just the ones I know about.

36:58.509 --> 37:02.297
With more time and research,
I could find hundreds,
thousands.

37:04.807 --> 37:08.299
But you're the first one
who's returned my phone calls.

37:08.685 --> 37:11.176
But I am going to find them,
all of them.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.517
I could go with you.

37:15.609 --> 37:17.520
I could help you,
think about it.

37:17.611 --> 37:20.023
These people could
need convincing.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.153
Who better to do that?

37:37.840 --> 37:39.296
Ando, over here.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.418

Come on,
I need a ride to Primm,
my mom's house.

37:51.061 --> 37:52.471
I'm sure she would
love to meet you.

37:52.563 --> 37:54.519
Where is Hiro?

37:54.731 --> 37:58.474
Oh, I took him to meet the guy
who could introduce him
to Mr. Linderman.

37:58.569 --> 37:59.729
He didn't wait for me?

37:59.820 --> 38:02.562
Well, he said he didn't
really need you anymore.

38:02.656 --> 38:05.443
But I didn't even
give you your bag yet.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.240
Why didn't you
wait for me?

38:13.625 --> 38:15.490
Three's a crowd, baby.

38:15.586 --> 38:16.871

I come in peace.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.882
I only saw the blonde, yes,
but I heard them talking.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.925
I know there were
two of them.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.549
I'm telling you,
she was incredibly strong.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.596
She broke my handcuffs.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.342
Any idea where
the diamonds are?

39:14.436 --> 39:15.892
You didn't
find the case?

39:15.979 --> 39:17.014
Nope.

39:17.272 --> 39:18.773
I guess the incredibly
strong killer

39:18.857 --> 39:20.438

must have taken it.
