<i>OSWALD: There's a war coming,</i>

00:02.191 --> 00:03.658
<i>a terrible war.</i>

00:03.692 --> 00:05.293
<i>There will be chaos,</i>

00:05.327 --> 00:06.844
rivers of blood in the streets,

00:06.875 --> 00:09.359
I know it! I-I can see it coming!

00:09.391 --> 00:14.228
It's time. Somebody has to take
over, it might as well be me.

00:14.262 --> 00:15.562
(Bruce screaming)

00:15.597 --> 00:16.997
<i>My name is James Gordon. I'm a detective.</i>

00:17.031 --> 00:18.866
My name is Bruce Wayne.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.667
I promise I will find the man who did this.

00:20.702 --> 00:22.403
Stop, or I'll shoot!

00:22.437 --> 00:23.904
<i>GORDON: He was framed</i>

00:23.938 --> 00:25.372
to cover up for the real killer.

00:25.407 --> 00:29.009
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

00:29.044 --> 00:30.477
<i>MONTOYA: He's killed a man.</i>

00:30.512 --> 00:32.846
And he killed him on the
orders of Carmine Falcone,

00:32.881 --> 00:34.481
biggest crime boss in Gotham.

00:34.516 --> 00:37.751
The death of the Waynes
would bring troubled times

00:37.786 --> 00:39.219
for our family and Gotham.

00:39.254 --> 00:41.321
<i>The Maroni family senses weakness.</i>

00:42.885 --> 00:44.958
Jim, it's for you.

00:51.332 --> 00:52.800
Jim.

00:54.903 --> 00:58.505
Hello, James, old friend.

01:01.230 --> 01:03.264
OSWALD: You must be Barbara.

01:03.299 --> 01:05.333
Yes, please come in.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.268
James, hi.

01:11.429 --> 01:12.693
I'm Peter.

01:12.727 --> 01:14.728
Peter... Humboldt.

01:14.762 --> 01:16.830
(laughs) Lovely to meet you at last.

01:16.865 --> 01:18.465
You're even more beautiful than I imagined.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.167
(laughing): Shush.

01:20.201 --> 01:22.136
Nice to meet you, Peter.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.771
I never get to meet any of Jim's friends,

01:23.805 --> 01:25.038
'cause he never tells me anything.

01:25.073 --> 01:27.307
- Mm. Men.
- Don't I know.

01:27.342 --> 01:28.942
Would you like a drink?

01:28.977 --> 01:31.545
No, uh... he's a work friend.

01:31.579 --> 01:33.213
It's a work thing.

01:33.248 --> 01:34.681
I'm just recently back in Gotham

01:34.716 --> 01:38.752
and I had an idea to
pop by out of the blue.

01:38.787 --> 01:40.621
But now is clearly not a good time.

01:40.655 --> 01:43.357
I'll walk you out.

01:43.391 --> 01:45.359
I told you never to come back here!

01:45.393 --> 01:47.628
I know. I know. I-I apologize.

01:47.662 --> 01:50.431
- But I-I just wanted to speak with you.
- No!

01:50.465 --> 01:53.267
If Falcone finds out you're
alive, he'll kill us both.

01:53.301 --> 01:54.935
I got no place else to go.

01:54.969 --> 01:57.271
(stammering) Gotham is my home.

01:57.305 --> 01:58.939
I should've killed you.

01:58.973 --> 02:01.675
I should put a bullet
in your head right now.

02:01.709 --> 02:04.645
And you would have every right to do so.

02:04.679 --> 02:06.980
But you won't, Jim Gordon,
because you're a good man.

02:07.015 --> 02:09.282
You may very well be the
last good man in Gotham,

02:09.317 --> 02:10.918
and that's why I want to help you.

02:10.952 --> 02:13.921
- I don't want your help.
- No, no, but you need it.

02:13.955 --> 02:17.791
That vile creature Fish Mooney,
Don Falcone, the police...

02:17.826 --> 02:19.860
not even your own partner trusts you.

02:19.894 --> 02:21.862
They will always hide the truth from you!

02:21.896 --> 02:24.798
But not me. Never.

02:24.833 --> 02:25.933
(chuckles)

02:25.967 --> 02:29.036
- You saved my life.
- God knows I wish I hadn't.

02:29.070 --> 02:31.939
(anxious panting)

02:31.973 --> 02:33.885
Kill me now or trust me!

02:38.413 --> 02:40.414
(glass shatters) (gasping)

02:43.163 --> 02:45.185
I told you there's a war coming, Jim.

02:46.951 --> 02:50.424
There will be so many deaths. So many.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.559
You want to save Gotham? I can help you.

02:52.594 --> 02:54.328
I can be your secret agent.

02:54.362 --> 02:56.430
Until Falcone finds out you're alive.

02:56.464 --> 02:58.465
Nobody looks for a dead man.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.136
This war...

03:02.170 --> 03:04.972
what are you talking about?
Why will there be a war?

03:05.006 --> 03:07.341
Well, as you know, war is just politics

03:07.375 --> 03:09.443
by other means.

03:09.477 --> 03:11.845
And isn't politics just money, talking?

03:11.880 --> 03:13.380
Talking about what?

03:13.415 --> 03:15.649
(chuckles)

03:15.684 --> 03:17.685
Arkham. Of course.

03:19.387 --> 03:20.888

- I am, sir.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.277
Excuse me.

03:43.311 --> 03:45.946
Councilman Jenkins?

03:45.981 --> 03:48.182
- Can I help you?
- Yes, uh,

03:48.216 --> 03:50.784
I'm one of your constituents.

03:50.819 --> 03:52.720
Voted for you every time.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.388
Well, thank you very much, my friend.

03:54.422 --> 03:55.489
I don't want to...

03:55.523 --> 03:57.157
take up too much of your valuable time.

03:57.192 --> 03:58.926
I just want to show you something.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.594
Well, I'm always happy
to help constituents,

04:00.628 --> 04:02.663
but perhaps you can come by my office.

04:02.697 --> 04:05.032
Sir, please, just one second.

04:05.066 --> 04:07.935
Now...

04:07.969 --> 04:09.937
I got the idea for this...

04:09.971 --> 04:11.338
years ago.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.576
Designed and built it myself.

04:18.346 --> 04:21.348
Here. Take a look.

04:21.382 --> 04:23.217
Go ahead. You...

04:23.251 --> 04:25.486
just put your eye in the end there.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.521
That's it.

04:27.555 --> 04:29.490
- What is that thing?
- You'll see.

04:29.524 --> 04:31.325
(grunts)

04:34.729 --> 04:37.398
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- You're next.

04:37.432 --> 04:39.600
(shouting)

04:41.903 --> 04:43.904
(grunting)

04:54.549 --> 04:56.250
(frantically pressing buttons)

05:00.288 --> 05:02.089
(screams weakly)

05:04.759 --> 05:06.527
Honestly, sir,

05:06.561 --> 05:07.995
I really did vote for you.

05:08.029 --> 05:09.463
(blade clicks)

05:21.856 --> 05:23.991
Hey, I'm working.

05:24.025 --> 05:26.460
Caught a double homicide. You're up.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.730
Uh, no way. Alvarez hasn't done
a case all week. It's his turn.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.832
ESSEN: Alvarez put in
double overtime last week.

05:31.866 --> 05:33.901
- Hey, Gordon.
- Captain.

05:33.935 --> 05:35.736
Councilman Ron Jenkins

05:35.770 --> 05:37.471
and his aide were found
dead in a parking structure

05:37.505 --> 05:39.006
this morning. Still waiting

05:39.040 --> 05:40.341
on the M.E.'s report,

05:40.375 --> 05:42.476
but their wallets and jewelry were missing.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.545
A councilman. Maybe it's a political hit.

05:44.579 --> 05:46.480
Nah, no one hits councilmen.
It's cheaper to bribe 'em.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.282
You kill 'em and another bum

05:48.316 --> 05:50.451
with his hand out just takes his place.

05:50.485 --> 05:52.586
ESSEN: Sniff around city hall if you want.

05:52.621 --> 05:54.822
Smart money says this was
just wrong place, wrong time.

05:54.856 --> 05:57.157
Go work it.

05:57.192 --> 05:59.693
(groans) Slave driver.

05:59.728 --> 06:01.595
Don't worry, Jim.

06:01.630 --> 06:04.732
I know just where to start.

06:04.766 --> 06:09.036
<i>♪ All at sea again ♪</i>

06:09.070 --> 06:13.741
<i>♪ And now my hurricanes ♪</i>

06:13.775 --> 06:16.744
<i>♪ Have brought down this ocean rain ♪</i>

06:16.778 --> 06:19.647
- You got talent.
- Hmm.

06:19.681 --> 06:21.115
She's not bad-looking.

06:21.149 --> 06:22.616
That's plenty.

06:22.651 --> 06:26.153
Come to me so I can take you in.

06:26.187 --> 06:28.856
You sing well.

06:28.890 --> 06:31.859
For this job, I need more
than a pair of nice pipes

06:31.893 --> 06:33.327
and a pretty face.

06:33.361 --> 06:34.895
I'll do whatever it takes.

06:34.930 --> 06:37.831
I like hearing that. So...

06:37.866 --> 06:40.501
you like boys or girls?

06:40.535 --> 06:43.070
Boys.

06:43.104 --> 06:45.072
Fine.

06:45.106 --> 06:47.007
Pretend I'm a boy.

06:47.042 --> 06:49.076
Seduce me.

07:00.388 --> 07:02.723
(moans softly)

07:05.126 --> 07:07.795
Least you can sing.

07:07.829 --> 07:10.598
Butch? Put a pin in this one.

07:10.632 --> 07:12.633
We'll call you.

07:14.436 --> 07:16.570
Not bad but keep looking.

07:16.605 --> 07:19.106
Really, boss? That's a good-looking girl.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.843
Look at me.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.512
I ain't looking for no girl.

07:25.547 --> 07:29.550
I'm looking for a weapon.

07:29.584 --> 07:31.885
Come on, Nicky, don't be modest.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.355
You're the crown prince
of parking lot muggers.

07:34.389 --> 07:35.956
No one's got a bigger rep.

07:35.991 --> 07:37.424
I'm on sabbatical.

07:37.459 --> 07:39.126
I didn't kill no one. That's not my thing.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.128
Then why'd you have a
shank in your backpack?

07:41.162 --> 07:42.930
Protection.

07:42.964 --> 07:45.299
BULLOCK: Councilman Jenkins was murdered.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.767
We know it was you.

07:46.801 --> 07:49.303
- We got witnesses.
- I swear to God I didn't do it!

07:50.972 --> 07:52.740
Hey. Hey!

07:52.774 --> 07:55.142
He's not our guy, Harvey.

08:03.485 --> 08:04.852
- Alvarez.
- Yo.

08:04.886 --> 08:06.053
What's this?

08:06.087 --> 08:07.721
Evidence from your crime scene.

08:07.756 --> 08:09.957
Couple of unis just dropped it off.

08:19.534 --> 08:22.169
Arkham.

08:22.203 --> 08:25.172
MAYOR AUBREY JAMES: 40
acres, 26 city blocks.

08:25.206 --> 08:27.808
The last major undeveloped district

08:27.842 --> 08:30.878
in the city of Gotham, Arkham.

08:30.912 --> 08:33.881
Now, before their
untimely and tragic deaths,

08:33.914 --> 08:37.351
Thomas and Martha Wayne
had a plan for their city,

08:37.385 --> 08:40.020
a progressive development plan

08:40.054 --> 08:43.357
that would raze Arkham's
shanty towns and, in its place,

08:43.390 --> 08:46.026
build new, affordable housing

08:46.061 --> 08:48.262
for Gotham's less fortunate.

08:48.296 --> 08:49.863
What about the old asylum, Mayor?

08:49.898 --> 08:52.132
Torn down. Brick by brick, if need be.

08:52.167 --> 08:54.468
And in its place, a
cutting-edge, state-of-the-art

08:54.502 --> 08:55.769
mental health facility.

08:55.804 --> 08:59.106
This is a vision for
the future of our city.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.141
An opposing plan is
gaining support recently.

09:01.176 --> 09:04.411
A plan that would do away
with the asylum altogether,

09:04.446 --> 09:07.581
use the surrounding land
as a waste disposal site.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.083
No.

09:09.117 --> 09:11.285
No, the Wayne plan is best for this city

09:11.319 --> 09:14.288
and, more importantly, for
the people of this city.

09:14.322 --> 09:16.490
This is why I am endorsing it.

09:20.328 --> 09:22.129
Don Maroni.

09:22.163 --> 09:23.530
(chuckles) Pleasure to see you.

09:23.565 --> 09:25.966
- Thank you. How are you?
- Please, please, have a seat.

09:26.001 --> 09:27.935
I'll bring wine and bread.

09:27.969 --> 09:30.037
Today is a day of celebration.

09:30.071 --> 09:32.706
A very lucrative deal is coming my way.

09:32.741 --> 09:35.142
Land, my friend.

09:35.176 --> 09:36.143
Land.

09:36.177 --> 09:38.412
That's where the big money is, huh?

09:47.856 --> 09:50.691
I need information about
the Wayne plan for Arkham.

09:50.725 --> 09:55.896
Well, it's the Wayne...
plan in name only now.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.798
When the Waynes died,

09:57.832 --> 10:00.801
Falcone stepped in. He's
backing the plan now.

10:00.835 --> 10:05.072
And he stands to make quite a
chunk of change, if it passes.

10:05.106 --> 10:07.708
But Councilman Jenkins
was backing Falcone's plan.

10:07.742 --> 10:08.809
That's right.

10:10.745 --> 10:13.447
- Then he was killed because...
- Because,

10:13.481 --> 10:17.184
Detective, there is an opposing plan.

10:20.789 --> 10:23.424
Maroni.

10:23.458 --> 10:27.027
He's the only one strong
enough to oppose Falcone.

10:27.062 --> 10:29.296
He's making a play at Arkham.

10:29.331 --> 10:32.099
BRUCE: Are they related?

10:32.133 --> 10:34.234
GORDON: Bruce.

10:34.269 --> 10:36.136
How are you?

10:36.171 --> 10:39.139
"A new Arkham Asylum will
serve the mentally ill of Gotham

10:39.174 --> 10:41.942
"in ways the present asylum never can.

10:41.977 --> 10:45.479
Those poor, sick souls deserve our help."

10:45.513 --> 10:47.881
My mother wrote that.

10:47.916 --> 10:50.150
She and my father fought

10:50.185 --> 10:52.252
for years to get a new asylum built.

10:52.287 --> 10:55.389
They thought that if they can
help the city's least fortunate,

10:55.423 --> 10:58.325
it would show there was hope for everyone.

11:01.229 --> 11:02.997
I just don't want my parents' dream

11:03.031 --> 11:04.765
to die with them.

11:04.799 --> 11:07.568
I understand that, Bruce.

11:07.602 --> 11:09.937
But this isn't just about the asylum.

11:09.971 --> 11:12.606
If there is a fight
between Falcone and Maroni,

11:12.641 --> 11:13.941
this could be the spark

11:13.975 --> 11:15.643
that ignites a citywide gang war.

11:17.145 --> 11:18.379
Innocents will die,

11:18.413 --> 11:19.680
and whatever little faith

11:19.714 --> 11:21.715
people have that the
police can protect them...

11:24.219 --> 11:26.086
it will be crushed.

11:26.121 --> 11:28.422
So you have to stop it.

11:32.961 --> 11:34.295
(sighs)

11:34.329 --> 11:37.164
(phone buzzing)

11:38.900 --> 11:40.067
This is Gordon.

11:40.101 --> 11:41.602
BULLOCK: Hey, it's me. We got a call.

11:41.636 --> 11:43.437
Councilmen Zeller
has been abducted.

11:43.471 --> 11:46.340
Listen, Gordon, Zeller's
one of Maroni's guys.

11:46.374 --> 11:49.376
Be right there.

12:15.704 --> 12:18.238
(muffled rattling, knocking)

12:21.409 --> 12:23.310
(shouts, gasps)

12:24.913 --> 12:26.246
Please...

12:26.281 --> 12:28.349
don't. I-I'm begging you.

12:28.383 --> 12:30.918
Ah... I... aah...!

12:32.454 --> 12:35.222
(grunting, whimpering)

12:35.257 --> 12:38.726
You know... if it were up to me,

12:38.760 --> 12:41.261
this would be over quick,
without all the fuss.

12:41.296 --> 12:42.896
My father used to say,

12:42.931 --> 12:46.400
"Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication."

12:47.535 --> 12:48.936
But it's not up to me.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.538
And my customer specifically asked me to...

12:51.573 --> 12:54.141
- send a message.
- (whimpering)

12:54.175 --> 12:55.743
And you know what they say:

12:55.777 --> 12:58.245
The customer is always right.

12:59.281 --> 13:01.081
(gasping, grunting)

13:01.116 --> 13:02.516
Please... help!

13:02.550 --> 13:04.618
You-you-you-you... you
don't have to do this!

13:04.653 --> 13:06.754
Help me, somebody! (groans)

13:08.423 --> 13:10.791
Hey! Hey! No, wait.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.393
(sobbing)

13:12.427 --> 13:15.095
Tell Falcone I'll change my vote.

13:15.130 --> 13:17.431
Hey-hey, I'll-I'll
back the mayor.

13:17.465 --> 13:20.134
I'll do anything he
wants, but please, please!

13:20.168 --> 13:21.769
Please... No! Please!

13:21.803 --> 13:23.304
Please! Please don't! Aah!

13:23.338 --> 13:24.338
(screaming)

13:33.765 --> 13:36.871
<i>ESSEN: Two councilmen dead in as many days.</i>

13:36.906 --> 13:38.073
Can't be a coincidence.

13:38.107 --> 13:39.674
Got to be politics driving this.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.076
He was right.

13:41.110 --> 13:44.212
I never said he was wrong.
I just wanted him to be.

13:44.246 --> 13:47.749
All right, genius, any other insights?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.684
Yeah. This is about the Arkham vote.

13:49.719 --> 13:51.553
- How so?
- Arkham is

13:51.587 --> 13:53.555
more than just a land deal; it's a war

13:53.589 --> 13:55.990
between Falcone and Maroni.

13:56.025 --> 13:58.026
These councilmen were on
opposite sides of that war.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.694
So, who did who?

13:59.729 --> 14:01.696
The way I see it, Maroni struck first.

14:01.731 --> 14:03.231
He had Jenkins

14:03.265 --> 14:04.966
killed to change the vote his way.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.634
Then Falcone retaliated,

14:06.669 --> 14:08.303
had Zeller killed to change the vote back.

14:08.337 --> 14:10.505
Burning the body was Falcone's
way of sending a message.

14:10.539 --> 14:12.006
ESSEN: I'll have guards put

14:12.041 --> 14:15.110
on all the other councilmen and
the mayor till this plays out.

14:16.145 --> 14:18.480
So, you want to tell me?

14:18.514 --> 14:21.149
Come on. Falcone, Maroni, Arkham?

14:21.183 --> 14:24.119
How the hell do you know
so much all a sudden?

14:25.821 --> 14:28.189
Ed, what you got?

14:28.224 --> 14:31.059
- I have a paradox for you.
- What?

14:31.093 --> 14:33.328
Well, a paradox, Detective,
is when you have...

14:33.362 --> 14:35.163
I know what a paradox is, smartass.

14:35.197 --> 14:36.464
What paradox?

14:36.499 --> 14:38.666
These are the medical examiner's reports

14:38.701 --> 14:41.503
on the murders of Councilman
Jenkins and his aide.

14:41.537 --> 14:44.539
Both victims sustained
fatal puncture wounds

14:44.573 --> 14:46.641
to the skull via the eye socket.

14:46.675 --> 14:49.744
The weapon was some kind of metal spike.

14:49.779 --> 14:52.447
- Okay. So?
- Councilman Zeller

14:52.481 --> 14:54.716
also has wounds from a metal spike.

14:54.750 --> 14:58.053
It's an extremely unlikely
coincidence, don't you think?

14:58.087 --> 14:59.788
So you're saying Zeller,

14:59.822 --> 15:02.157
Jenkins and the aide were
killed by the same person?

15:02.191 --> 15:05.460
It would appear so, wouldn't it?

15:05.494 --> 15:08.797
Same killer working for
both Maroni and Falcone?

15:08.831 --> 15:10.632
That's nuts.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.100
(chuckles)

15:12.134 --> 15:14.135
Only in Gotham. Come on.

15:14.170 --> 15:15.704
Where are we going?

15:15.738 --> 15:17.739
Go see a friend of mine.

15:28.150 --> 15:30.151
What the hell you think you're doing?!

15:30.186 --> 15:31.519
I...

15:31.554 --> 15:33.088
You were snooping, you little worm.

15:33.122 --> 15:34.189
I told you

15:34.223 --> 15:36.725
the day I gave you this job that, in here,

15:36.759 --> 15:38.560
you don't see nothing,
you don't hear nothing.

15:38.594 --> 15:40.829
I'm sorry, sir. I... beg your pardon.

15:40.863 --> 15:44.499
You keep that sniveling nose of
yours to yourself, understood?

15:44.533 --> 15:46.534
Yes, sir.

15:57.513 --> 16:00.548
Two cartons. Must be important.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.584
- We're looking for a hit man.
- Yeah?

16:02.618 --> 16:04.419
Which family does he work for?

16:04.453 --> 16:06.721
A few. He's an independent type, like you.

16:06.756 --> 16:08.857
Not too many of them still around.

16:10.226 --> 16:11.192
Who'd he hit?

16:11.227 --> 16:13.228
Two city councilmen and an aide.

16:13.262 --> 16:15.363
Uses some sort of special
weapon to kill his victims.

16:15.398 --> 16:17.766
Steel spike?

16:17.800 --> 16:19.768
About so big?

16:19.802 --> 16:22.370
Could be.

16:22.405 --> 16:24.539
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

16:24.573 --> 16:27.742
His name's Gladwell. A real pro.

16:27.777 --> 16:29.577
You know where we can find him?

16:29.612 --> 16:30.779
Word was

16:30.813 --> 16:34.282
he works out of the
Lansky building in Midtown.

16:37.453 --> 16:38.920
- (elevator bell dings)
- You coming or what?

16:38.954 --> 16:40.655
We got 12 more floors to check out.

16:40.690 --> 16:41.856
What's got you so wound up?

16:41.891 --> 16:43.091
Maybe I'm just doing my job.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.492
No, you've been acting weird lately,

16:44.527 --> 16:46.494
like you got something to hide.

16:46.529 --> 16:48.430
GCPD, ma'am.

16:48.464 --> 16:50.432
We're looking for
someone who may work here.

16:50.466 --> 16:52.133
Last name Gladwell.

16:52.168 --> 16:54.235
Oh, you mean Richard. He
works in Human Resources.

16:55.604 --> 16:57.005
Richard's not in any trouble, is he?

16:57.039 --> 16:58.907
BULLOCK: Which desk is his?

17:00.710 --> 17:02.711
Third one from the back.

17:12.288 --> 17:15.022
Gladwell. Richard Gladwell...
has anyone seen him?

17:15.057 --> 17:16.391
You just missed him.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.593
Where'd he go? He was just here.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.462
Maybe he headed out the back?

17:21.497 --> 17:22.997
I'm gonna go check it out.

17:23.031 --> 17:25.066
Stay here in case he comes back?

18:08.478 --> 18:10.612
BULLOCK: Jim!

18:10.646 --> 18:12.381
I found something!

18:18.189 --> 18:20.157
Look what was in his desk.

18:20.191 --> 18:22.126
Jenkins and Zeller. We got him.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.927
Man, I love the easy ones.

18:26.264 --> 18:28.232
(door closes)

18:36.041 --> 18:37.941
Freeze!

18:37.976 --> 18:39.576
(gasps)

18:39.611 --> 18:41.178
It's-it's just a box of paperclips.

18:41.212 --> 18:42.813
I didn't think anyone would mind.

18:42.847 --> 18:43.947
- (woman crying)
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

18:43.982 --> 18:45.516
Are you okay?

18:45.550 --> 18:46.817
(crying)

18:56.700 --> 18:58.468
"C, L, M."

18:58.502 --> 19:00.904
What do you think it means?

19:00.938 --> 19:03.724
I don't know.

19:10.948 --> 19:13.183
(gasps, panting)

19:13.217 --> 19:15.785
- You all right?
- (sighs)

19:15.820 --> 19:18.121
I'm fine. (sniffles, clears his throat)

19:18.155 --> 19:21.324
- Why?
- Well...

19:21.358 --> 19:23.760
I heard screaming.

19:23.794 --> 19:25.595
A bad dream.

19:25.629 --> 19:27.831
Oh.

19:29.621 --> 19:30.754
Was I in it?

19:30.788 --> 19:34.124
(quiet laugh) Not this time.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.362
Alfred, are there any more
files on the Arkham plant?

19:38.396 --> 19:39.529
Oh, yeah.

19:39.564 --> 19:42.933
Absolutely. Untold. Piles
of the bloody things.

19:42.967 --> 19:47.170
I'd like to see them, please. All of them.

19:47.205 --> 19:49.773
And may I ask, uh, why?

19:51.809 --> 19:54.945
I'm looking for a connection.

19:54.979 --> 19:58.482
Between the councilmen murders
and the murders of my parents.

19:59.517 --> 20:01.718
I see.

20:03.855 --> 20:05.956
(tires screeching)

20:09.227 --> 20:11.895
Nobody move! This is a robbery!

20:12.764 --> 20:14.531
(people screaming)

20:14.566 --> 20:16.400
(gunshot, people screaming)

20:16.434 --> 20:17.668
Money's in the back. Go, go!

20:17.702 --> 20:19.870
Come on... you, too! Get over there!

20:20.872 --> 20:23.473
(gunshots, people screaming)

20:23.508 --> 20:25.008
Move! Move! Move!

20:28.046 --> 20:30.247
(tires squealing)

20:30.281 --> 20:32.316
(people screaming, shouting)

20:32.350 --> 20:34.084
(tires squealing)

20:35.620 --> 20:37.321
Move! Out of the way.

20:37.355 --> 20:38.689
(indistinct chatter, woman groaning)

20:38.723 --> 20:40.657
Out of my way.

20:44.395 --> 20:47.064
Check the back.

20:53.037 --> 20:54.738
They got the money, Frankie.

20:54.772 --> 20:57.841
I got eyes, don't I?

21:21.023 --> 21:22.792
(anxious gasping)

21:22.826 --> 21:24.160
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

21:24.194 --> 21:25.628
They had... they had guns, and...

21:25.662 --> 21:28.431
and-and Lou... Lou was hit in the stomach.

21:28.465 --> 21:31.267
- Is-is... is he...?
- Forget about Lou!

21:31.301 --> 21:32.502
Who did this?

21:32.536 --> 21:35.505
Uh... they had masks. I-I couldn't see.

21:35.539 --> 21:37.106
But you got the money.

21:37.141 --> 21:38.141
Oh, yeah.

21:38.175 --> 21:40.977
I managed to hide this
bag, but they got the rest.

21:41.011 --> 21:43.279
- I'm sorry. I...
- Hey, relax, kid.

21:43.313 --> 21:46.149
Save it for the boss.

21:46.183 --> 21:47.984
(panting, groaning)

21:50.320 --> 21:53.222
(door opens)

21:53.257 --> 21:55.258
(door closes)

21:58.829 --> 22:01.964
You're off early for a change.

22:01.999 --> 22:04.000
I missed you.

22:08.639 --> 22:10.706
You all right?

22:10.741 --> 22:12.975
Long hours and late nights, Jim.

22:13.010 --> 22:15.978
- They make me worry.
- About what?

22:16.013 --> 22:17.814
All kinds of things.

22:17.848 --> 22:19.448
I'm just doing my job.

22:19.483 --> 22:21.117
Are you?

22:21.151 --> 22:24.387
(sighs) What is that supposed to mean?

22:24.421 --> 22:27.256
It means I think you have secrets from me.

22:27.291 --> 22:29.592
And I hate it.

22:29.626 --> 22:31.694
What do you want me to say, Barbara?

22:31.728 --> 22:34.363
Yeah. I have secrets.

22:34.398 --> 22:35.898
It's part of my job.

22:35.933 --> 22:38.100
- It's how I make sure...
- Who's Oswald Cobblepot?

22:40.604 --> 22:42.605
How do you know that name?

22:42.639 --> 22:44.340
Doesn't matter.

22:44.374 --> 22:45.708
Who is he?

22:47.478 --> 22:50.046
I can't even begin to answer that.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.280
Can't or won't?

22:55.986 --> 22:57.587
Montoya.

22:59.656 --> 23:01.757
She came to see you, didn't she?

23:01.792 --> 23:03.092
Yes.

23:03.126 --> 23:05.127
Why does she keep coming to you?

23:05.162 --> 23:06.796
What is there between you and her?

23:10.100 --> 23:15.037
Years ago, before I was with you...

23:15.072 --> 23:20.076
she and I were in a relationship.

23:25.949 --> 23:27.783
What?

23:29.286 --> 23:31.254
It only lasted a year,

23:31.288 --> 23:33.723
and then I-I ended it and moved on.

23:33.757 --> 23:36.125
And what, she didn't?

23:36.160 --> 23:38.761
I don't know.

23:38.795 --> 23:41.230
I don't care, okay? Because you are the one

23:41.265 --> 23:43.900
that I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

23:47.838 --> 23:49.806
(wry laugh) What, you're angry?

23:49.840 --> 23:52.742
- What do you think?
- Because she's a woman?

23:52.776 --> 23:54.977
Because... you lied to me!

23:56.446 --> 23:58.147
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:58.182 --> 24:00.183
I should have told you.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.419
<i>MARONI: Falcone thinks he could hit me</i>

24:07.453 --> 24:10.122
in my place of business
and get away with it?

24:10.156 --> 24:11.957
He's got another thing coming, Frankie.

24:11.991 --> 24:13.692
I want to hit him back.

24:13.726 --> 24:15.260
This time, where it hurts.

24:15.294 --> 24:17.629
I want to hit The Mouth.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.465
MARONI: It's time, son.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.101
CARBONE: I'll take care of it.

24:24.137 --> 24:26.271
Then there's the other thing.

24:29.008 --> 24:31.009
Send him over.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.522
(clears throat quietly)

24:43.556 --> 24:45.157
You know I'm a man

24:45.191 --> 24:47.960
that shows appreciation
when appreciation is due.

24:47.994 --> 24:49.628
Yes, Don Maroni.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.631
What you did for me yesterday
did not go unnoticed.

24:52.665 --> 24:53.632
(laughs quietly)

24:53.666 --> 24:54.733
Well, thank you, sir.

24:54.767 --> 24:56.902
I-I only wish I was
able to retrieve the...

24:56.936 --> 24:58.036
- retrieve the other half of your...
- Bup-bup-bup-bup.

24:58.071 --> 25:00.138
Bup.

25:00.173 --> 25:02.607
How long you been washing dishes?

25:02.642 --> 25:05.043
- Not long.
- All right, that ends today.

25:05.078 --> 25:07.679
You've been promoted to restaurant manager.

25:09.182 --> 25:11.917
The position recently became available.

25:12.919 --> 25:15.354
Thank you, Don Maroni.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.456
- I won't let you down.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:17.490 --> 25:18.991
You're welcome.

25:19.025 --> 25:20.225
(sighs)

25:21.527 --> 25:22.861
Frankie, get the kid a suit.

25:22.895 --> 25:24.930
(laughs softly)

25:49.145 --> 25:50.170
He's dead.

25:51.958 --> 25:54.520
- Who?
- Richard Gladwell.

25:54.564 --> 25:58.264
At least the real one.
Since some units by his apartament found

25:58.313 --> 26:00.280
moldy old corpse sealed inside.

26:00.315 --> 26:02.916
Puncture wound through the
eye; been dead five years.

26:02.951 --> 26:05.385
- And no one found him until now?
- Landlord said

26:05.420 --> 26:08.388
he paid his rent on time,
kept quiet... the ideal tenant.

26:08.423 --> 26:10.657
So our Hit Man killed this Gladwell

26:10.692 --> 26:12.526
to use his identity as cover.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.061
And it worked, too.

26:14.095 --> 26:17.598
Employee records, payroll,
contact information... all fake.

26:17.632 --> 26:19.800
We got nothing but a face.

26:19.834 --> 26:22.169
Damn.

26:22.203 --> 26:23.604
(sighs) All right...

26:23.638 --> 26:25.606
Well, there's got to be something to this.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.574
"C-L-M."
You got any ideas?

26:27.609 --> 26:30.110
It's a complete waste of time.

26:30.144 --> 26:33.013
It's a lead. Our only lead.

26:33.047 --> 26:35.148
Says you.

26:35.183 --> 26:36.650
You can't be this lazy.

26:36.684 --> 26:39.286
Lazy? Maybe I just work smarter than you.

26:39.320 --> 26:42.489
- Ever consider that?
- Yeah. I considered it.

26:42.523 --> 26:44.424
Look, this Arkham vote

26:44.459 --> 26:46.960
is tomorrow... we don't
find this guy by then...

26:46.995 --> 26:48.328
What? What happens?

26:48.363 --> 26:50.430
Worst case: a major gang war.

26:50.465 --> 26:52.399
People will die. Maybe a lot of people.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.368
We find this guy, we can stop it.

26:57.539 --> 26:59.273
And where are you going?

26:59.307 --> 27:00.340
To work the case.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.209
You got your ways, I got mine.

27:03.244 --> 27:05.178
Hey, Harvey...

27:05.213 --> 27:07.347
tell her I said hi.

Liza.

27:41.449 --> 27:44.251
How long have you been singing, Liza?

27:44.285 --> 27:46.386
Not long.

27:47.422 --> 27:50.023
You like boys or girls?

27:52.227 --> 27:54.761
Boys.

27:54.796 --> 27:57.531
So... you want the job, or what?

27:57.565 --> 27:59.833
Well, you haven't told me what it is yet.

27:59.868 --> 28:02.202
You want to be a woman with power,

28:02.237 --> 28:04.238
money and respect, like me?

28:05.440 --> 28:08.075
I guess. Yeah.

28:08.109 --> 28:10.010
Are you willing to do whatever it takes

28:10.044 --> 28:11.411
to have it all?

28:12.447 --> 28:14.214
Yes.

28:14.249 --> 28:16.283
I am.

28:17.318 --> 28:18.952
That's the job.

28:22.824 --> 28:24.958
Seduce me.

28:24.993 --> 28:27.361
(laughing): What...?

28:28.997 --> 28:31.398
You think I'm kidding?

28:55.990 --> 28:57.491
(exhales softly)

29:01.629 --> 29:03.630
(kisses, sighs)

29:14.309 --> 29:16.076
(exhales)

29:29.390 --> 29:31.525
Harvey...

29:31.559 --> 29:34.161
you see something you like?

29:34.195 --> 29:35.696
I do now.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.998
I need your help.

29:38.032 --> 29:40.434
City councilmen are dropping like flies.

29:40.468 --> 29:42.336
- I heard.
- Bad for business.

29:42.370 --> 29:43.804
You're not wrong.

29:43.838 --> 29:46.173
The Button Man's a guy called
Gladwell... you know him?

29:46.207 --> 29:47.808
Only by reputation.

29:47.842 --> 29:49.109
Think you can find him?

29:49.143 --> 29:52.246
I can find anyone if I have the time.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.615
The question is, what's in it for me?

29:54.649 --> 29:57.050
(whispers): I'll owe you.

30:01.022 --> 30:05.192
Okay, but I still think it's
a waste of time, if you ask me.

30:05.226 --> 30:07.995
Falcone'll just get
someone to take his place.

30:08.029 --> 30:09.796
He's not gonna let this bone go.

30:09.831 --> 30:10.880
Why's that?

30:10.930 --> 30:14.118
Falcone cannot afford to lose
that vote.

30:14.143 --> 30:16.580
If Moroni gets even a piece
of Arkham,

30:16.630 --> 30:19.468
it'll only prove
what we already know.

30:19.541 --> 30:24.077
And that is: Falcone is old and weak.

30:24.112 --> 30:26.179
You seem kinda pleased about that.

30:26.214 --> 30:27.814
How come?

30:27.849 --> 30:29.416
Falcone goes down, so do you.

30:29.450 --> 30:30.984
Harvey...

30:31.019 --> 30:34.421
don't you worry about me.

30:34.455 --> 30:38.158
I always have a Plan B.

30:43.531 --> 30:44.865
(phone rings)

30:45.900 --> 30:48.769
- Detective Gordon.
- Hello, old friend.

30:50.538 --> 30:52.573
What do you want?

30:52.607 --> 30:54.675
To offer you help.

30:54.709 --> 30:57.311
To prove that you can trust me.

30:57.345 --> 30:59.446
There's gonna be another murder.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.248
Maroni has put out the hit.

31:01.282 --> 31:02.549
Who's the target?

31:02.584 --> 31:04.251
Someone backing Falcone's plan.

31:04.285 --> 31:06.253
Who it is, I can't be certain.

31:06.287 --> 31:08.889
All the councilmen are under
police protection tonight.

31:08.923 --> 31:10.224
(chuckles)

31:10.258 --> 31:12.593
There are many ways around the police.

31:12.627 --> 31:14.828
But the hit will happen tonight...

31:14.862 --> 31:16.263
that much I can be certain of.

31:16.297 --> 31:17.764
How do you know this?

31:17.799 --> 31:20.367
I told you, Detective...

31:20.401 --> 31:23.804
Gotham is my home.

31:39.988 --> 31:41.388
I need a list of the officers

31:41.422 --> 31:42.890
working police protection tonight.

31:46.327 --> 31:49.062
Campos, Lazenby, Martins.

31:49.097 --> 31:51.398
C-L-M.

31:54.669 --> 31:55.969
VOICEMAIL: It's Harvey. (beep)

31:56.004 --> 31:58.438
Bullock, I found out who
Gladwell's next target is.

31:58.473 --> 32:00.307
It's the mayor.

32:21.796 --> 32:23.063
Detective Gordon. What's going on?

32:23.097 --> 32:25.098
Sir, I think your life may be in danger.

32:25.133 --> 32:27.968
- I need to get you out of here.
- What? No, I...

32:28.002 --> 32:29.369
I'm not going anywhere...
I got police protection.

32:29.404 --> 32:31.438
- They're gone.
- What?

32:31.472 --> 32:32.906
I just checked, no one's out there.

32:32.941 --> 32:34.908
Sir, I think someone's
coming here to kill you.

32:34.943 --> 32:36.610
I got to get some things from my safe.

32:58.366 --> 33:02.069
(safe opens)

33:02.103 --> 33:05.038
- Sir, we need to go... now.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

33:05.073 --> 33:06.039
Is there someplace I can take you?

33:06.074 --> 33:07.541
Somewhere you'll be safe?

33:07.575 --> 33:09.009
We're not going to the police station?

33:09.043 --> 33:11.511
I'm not sure you'll be
safe there. The police...

33:14.015 --> 33:15.849
- What the hell is this town coming to?
- Sir.

33:15.884 --> 33:17.851
All right, all right, I'm...

33:17.886 --> 33:20.754
My sister's house. It's across town.

33:32.767 --> 33:34.768
Let's go.

33:47.715 --> 33:49.349
Go! Go! Go!

33:53.621 --> 33:55.088
GORDON: Is there another way out?

33:55.123 --> 33:57.124
Here.

34:00.695 --> 34:02.196
(thumping) He's trying to get in.

34:02.230 --> 34:04.031
Shoot him. Why don't you shoot him?

34:04.065 --> 34:05.899
He's got my gun. I can't. Go, go, go!

34:05.934 --> 34:08.569
(gunshots)

34:41.101 --> 34:43.070
Drop it!

34:43.103 --> 34:44.737
Drop it or I'll shoot!

34:55.183 --> 34:56.917
You know why they hire a professional?

34:58.653 --> 35:00.020
'Cause he finishes the job.

35:37.245 --> 35:39.279
How are you?

35:39.314 --> 35:40.814
Okay.

35:42.450 --> 35:46.153
Jim, I should've told you
about Montoya a long time ago.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.156
- Then why didn't you?
- I don't know.

35:49.190 --> 35:52.493
Because she works with you.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.428
Because she's a woman.

35:54.462 --> 35:58.098
Are you sure there isn't another reason?

35:58.132 --> 36:00.934
No. There's nothing else.

36:00.969 --> 36:04.872
Jim, I don't want there to
be any secrets between us.

36:04.906 --> 36:07.007
- Neither do I.
- Good.

36:07.041 --> 36:10.344
So you'll tell me who Oswald Cobblepot is.

36:13.348 --> 36:15.182
Damn it, Barbara. Why can't you drop this?

36:15.216 --> 36:18.285
- Why can't you just tell me who he is?
- Because...

36:19.287 --> 36:22.156
it's work. (sighs)

36:22.190 --> 36:24.525
I know. But you've told
me about your work before.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.693
And that was a mistake.

36:26.728 --> 36:29.830
One I am not going to make again.

36:35.403 --> 36:37.571
All right. Well...

36:37.605 --> 36:40.107
I'm not gonna live like this.

36:42.076 --> 36:43.944
I can't live like this.

36:43.978 --> 36:48.615
You're gonna have to make a choice, Jim.

36:48.650 --> 36:51.685
You either let me in or you let me go.

37:01.029 --> 37:03.030
(scoffs)

37:24.385 --> 37:25.719
<i>MOONEY: All right.</i>

37:25.753 --> 37:28.722
I'm going to cut to the chase.

37:28.756 --> 37:33.760
I like you both, but I
only have one opening.

37:33.795 --> 37:36.196
You've got the talent.

37:36.231 --> 37:38.232
And you've got...

37:39.267 --> 37:41.034
something else.

37:41.069 --> 37:45.038
I can't decide, so...

37:45.073 --> 37:48.709
you two are going to have to do it for me.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.085
You want us to fight for it?

38:05.293 --> 38:07.694
(grunting)

38:22.644 --> 38:24.645
(panting)

38:33.054 --> 38:35.556
So when do I start?

38:52.507 --> 38:54.474
It's you. (chuckles)

38:54.509 --> 38:56.476
Scared us there for a second.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.485
We do good or what?

39:05.520 --> 39:07.087
Excellent work, my friends.

39:07.121 --> 39:10.190
- You were very convincing.
- Yeah, I bet that manager

39:10.225 --> 39:11.859
sure thought so, huh?
Ain't that right, Dickie?

39:11.893 --> 39:13.627
(mimics gunshots, laughs) (mimics gunshot)

39:13.661 --> 39:15.696
(men laughing)

39:15.730 --> 39:17.831
You got any other joints you
want us to rob, let us know.

39:17.866 --> 39:19.533
- Good money in this.
- Yeah, good money.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.439
What's that?

39:25.473 --> 39:28.041
Oh, I brought cannoli.

39:28.076 --> 39:30.077
Oh, yeah! Ha!

39:33.014 --> 39:34.214
Now, eat up.

39:34.249 --> 39:36.283
You guys deserve this.

39:36.317 --> 39:37.951
Oh.

39:37.986 --> 39:39.853
Mmm! Check this out.

39:42.390 --> 39:46.360
Mmm! Mmm! Really good.

39:46.394 --> 39:47.361
Oh, real good.

39:47.395 --> 39:50.497
Mmm! Mmm!

39:57.338 --> 39:58.739
<i>TV REPORTER: The Arkham development vote</i>

39:58.773 --> 40:00.941
<i>has been a topic of controversy for weeks.</i>

40:00.975 --> 40:02.309
<i>Today we have the results.</i>

40:02.343 --> 40:04.912
<i>We go live now to Mayor
James's press conference.</i>

40:04.946 --> 40:07.181
Do you mind turning that
down? My head's killing me.

40:07.215 --> 40:08.649
Aw, shut up.

40:08.683 --> 40:10.717
This is what we worked for.

40:10.752 --> 40:12.319
We did this.

40:12.353 --> 40:14.588
<i>How is today's outcome not simply a failure</i>

40:14.622 --> 40:15.856
<i>of the Wayne plan?</i>

40:15.890 --> 40:18.058
This is not a case of either plan failing.

40:18.092 --> 40:19.927
This is a case of compromise

40:19.961 --> 40:22.529
for what's best for the people of Gotham.

40:22.564 --> 40:24.865
The Arkham district will be developed

40:24.899 --> 40:27.701
into both low-cost housing as well

40:27.735 --> 40:30.370
as a much-needed site for waste disposal.

40:30.405 --> 40:32.573
This is the best of both plans...

40:32.607 --> 40:34.741
together in one.

40:34.776 --> 40:36.944
- (men chuckling)
- Yes.

40:36.978 --> 40:41.148
For years, this city's been
giving us nothing but scraps.

40:41.182 --> 40:43.984
But from now on...

40:44.018 --> 40:45.919
from now on...

40:45.954 --> 40:47.588
we feast.

40:47.622 --> 40:50.190
(men agreeing, chuckling)

40:50.225 --> 40:51.859
Mayor James, what about the asylum?

40:51.893 --> 40:53.460
What's going to happen to it?

40:53.494 --> 40:55.596

40:57.632 --> 40:59.433
Gotham needs... No,

40:59.467 --> 41:01.435
<i>Gotham deserves</i>

41:01.469 --> 41:03.770
a world-class treatment facility

41:03.805 --> 41:05.772
for the mentally ill.

41:05.807 --> 41:08.709
Falcone took a shot to the body today.

41:08.743 --> 41:13.614
Maybe a few more will put him on his back.

41:15.617 --> 41:19.786
Looks like I got you just in time.

41:19.821 --> 41:21.955
And I know that the Waynes,

41:21.990 --> 41:24.424
were they still alive,

41:24.459 --> 41:28.262
would be proud of what we've
been able to accomplish today.

41:33.034 --> 41:36.403
The mayor's making this new plan
sound like it's good for Gotham.

41:36.437 --> 41:38.972
- But-but it's not, is it?
- No, it's not.

41:39.007 --> 41:40.374
Then why is he doing it?

41:40.408 --> 41:43.610
He was caught between two
very powerful opposing forces.

41:43.645 --> 41:45.312
- Falcone and Maroni.
- Maroni threatened

41:45.346 --> 41:46.780
the mayor's life.

41:46.814 --> 41:48.582
Out of fear, I'm guessing,

41:48.616 --> 41:50.117
the mayor made a compromise

41:50.151 --> 41:52.085
and gave Maroni a huge piece of Arkham.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.253
What piece?

41:53.288 --> 41:56.290
Maroni gets to build a waste disposal site

41:56.324 --> 41:59.193
and he gets the contract
to refurbish Arkham.

41:59.227 --> 42:02.162
Falcone gets to build a
low-income housing project.

42:02.197 --> 42:04.832
(sighs)

42:04.866 --> 42:06.366
Look...

42:06.401 --> 42:11.205
Bruce, I know it's not the
outcome you had hoped for,

42:11.239 --> 42:14.141
but this compromise

42:14.175 --> 42:17.477
may have prevented a lot of bloodshed.

42:17.512 --> 42:19.947
It may have even stopped a war.

42:19.981 --> 42:24.218
My parents believed a new asylum
would bring hope to Gotham.

42:24.252 --> 42:25.886
Now that's gone.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.287
Everything they worked for

42:27.322 --> 42:29.289
is now falling into the hands of criminals.

42:29.324 --> 42:31.959
Not everything.

42:31.993 --> 42:33.894
You're alive.

42:35.597 --> 42:37.731
It's not too late.

42:39.267 --> 42:42.002
Do you really believe that?

42:44.873 --> 42:47.474
Do you believe Gotham can be saved?

42:49.143 --> 42:51.973
I believe it's worth trying.
