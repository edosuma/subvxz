11:38.727 --> 11:40.460
I CARE NOTHING FOR SAFE, AND I

11:40.462 --> 11:40.993
WILL NOT--

11:40.995 --> 11:42.828
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

11:50.603 --> 11:52.369
ARGH!

11:58.743 --> 12:01.477
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

12:01.479 --> 12:02.744
TO ME.

12:02.746 --> 12:05.113
THIS IS WHY I MUST STAY HERE.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.848
BUT I CANNOT.

12:06.850 --> 12:08.482
YOU MUST LET ME PURSUE THIS

12:08.484 --> 12:09.249

12:09.251 --> 12:11.084
I WILL NOT LET IT HARM ANYONE

12:20.027 --> 12:22.027
MY FRIENDS!

12:22.029 --> 12:24.195
HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU!

12:24.197 --> 12:27.598
EVER THINK ABOUT A DOORBELL?

12:27.600 --> 12:28.432
THIS IS GREAT!

12:28.434 --> 12:30.534
I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A...

12:30.536 --> 12:31.868
HUH?

12:31.870 --> 12:33.035
MAYBE JUST A GLASS OF WATER AND

12:33.037 --> 12:33.935
A TOOTHPICK.

12:33.937 --> 12:34.936
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR

12:34.938 --> 12:35.836
RED STAR...

12:35.838 --> 12:37.771
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

12:37.773 --> 12:39.339
HER PEOPLE ARE MOST RESILIENT.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.540
YOUR VILLAGE THINKS YOU'VE

12:40.542 --> 12:41.807
BEEN ATTACKING IT.

12:41.809 --> 12:42.841
WHY?

12:42.843 --> 12:44.175
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOW I

12:44.177 --> 12:45.776
CAME TO BE.

12:47.045 --> 12:48.310
THE LIFE I HAD BEFORE WAS A

12:48.312 --> 12:50.345
DIFFICULT ONE, BUT SUITED ME

12:50.347 --> 12:51.479
WELL.

12:51.481 --> 12:53.113
I WAS CHOSEN TO BE PART OF AN

12:53.115 --> 12:54.814
EXPERIMENT.

12:54.816 --> 12:55.881
THE SECURITY FORCE WISHED TO

12:55.883 --> 12:58.583
CREATE THE PERFECT SOLDIER.

13:26.879 --> 13:29.746
THEY HAD MUCH HOPE FOR ME.

13:29.748 --> 13:31.581
AND AT FIRST, IT SEEMED

13:31.583 --> 13:33.716
SUCCESSFUL.

13:41.391 --> 13:42.323
THERE WAS, HOWEVER, AN

13:42.325 --> 13:44.925
UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECT--THIS

13:44.927 --> 13:46.893
POWER INSIDE ME.

13:49.430 --> 13:52.497
A POWER I COULD NOT CONTAIN.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.104
I HAVE BEEN HERE EVER SINCE.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.272
MEMORIES HAVE LONG LIVES.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.040
MY PEOPLE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN.

14:04.042 --> 14:05.674
YOU MUST GET LONELY HERE BY

14:05.676 --> 14:06.474
YOURSELF.

14:06.476 --> 14:09.009
IT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.710
COME, THERE IS SOMETHING I WISH

14:10.712 --> 14:12.510
YOU TO SEE.

14:15.214 --> 14:18.348
EVERY DAY, I MUST SHED MY POWER.

14:18.350 --> 14:20.016
HERE IT IS SAVED.

14:20.018 --> 14:21.017
YOU COULD LIGHT AN ENTIRE

14:21.019 --> 14:22.518

14:22.520 --> 14:23.886
AND YET, THEY WOULD NEVER

14:23.888 --> 14:24.653
ACCEPT.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.221
YOU MUST USE YOUR ABILITY TO

14:26.223 --> 14:27.522
HELP PEOPLE.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.190
WE WILL ASSIST YOU.

14:29.192 --> 14:30.558
THERE IS NO NEED TO HIDE ANY

14:31.694 --> 14:34.394
IT IS A GOOD WISH, BUT HERE I

14:34.396 --> 14:36.162
AM CONTAINED.

14:36.164 --> 14:37.396
AS LONG AS I'M IN THIS PLACE,

14:37.398 --> 14:39.164
THE WORLD IS SAFE FROM ME.

14:39.166 --> 14:40.398

14:45.170 --> 14:48.704

14:54.843 --> 14:56.909
JUST NOBODY TOUCH IT!

15:15.095 --> 15:17.994
YOU WANT TO END UP LIKE THAT?

15:19.197 --> 15:21.063
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!

15:21.065 --> 15:23.065

16:12.974 --> 16:15.374
THIS WON'T TURN OUT GOOD.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.816
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.751
I CANNOT CONTROL WHAT IS INSIDE

16:26.753 --> 16:27.485
ME.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.320
HERE I AM CONTAINED.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.121
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.291
THERE'S A LEAK, RED STAR.

16:35.293 --> 16:36.959
THAT CREATURE...

16:36.961 --> 16:39.061
IT CAME FROM YOU.

16:47.070 --> 16:49.070
I WAS A FOOL TO THINK I COULD

16:49.072 --> 16:50.404
HAVE PREVENTED THIS.

16:50.406 --> 16:51.505
THERE WERE MICROSCOPIC CRACKS

16:51.507 --> 16:52.672
IN THE POWER CONDUIT.

16:52.674 --> 16:54.473
THERE WAS NO WAY YOU COULD'VE
KNOWN.

FEAR.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.576

16:58.578 --> 17:00.578
THESE THINGS AS WELL.
