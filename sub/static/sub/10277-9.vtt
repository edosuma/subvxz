WEBVTT

00:04.910 --> 00:06.447
Previously on E.R.

00:06.448 --> 00:07.689
He's doing drugs, I know it.

00:07.724 --> 00:10.534
I've told you a thousand times,
I don't get high!

00:10.535 --> 00:12.635
There is a woman out there
who could be dying. Do you understand that?

00:12.636 --> 00:16.641
This is your last chance. Tell me
where she is or I'll let you bleed to death.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.798
- Mark.
- What?

00:18.071 --> 00:20.132
- Thank you.
- You did good mom.

00:20.541 --> 00:21.795
I pressured Mr. Rollins.

00:21.796 --> 00:23.629
Lizzie, you never fail to impress me.

00:23.630 --> 00:25.759
I didn't think you had it in you
to cross that line.

00:27.309 --> 00:30.180
6x09 "HOW THE FINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS"

00:33.858 --> 00:35.233
Hello

00:35.568 --> 00:37.146
Hi, Mom.

00:37.362 --> 00:41.229
No, I'm making the nakypliak
right now.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.945
Yeah.

00:44.035 --> 00:46.408
I know it's after 6.

00:46.621 --> 00:49.457
But the day just got away from me.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.203
Yeah.

00:53.337 --> 00:54.617
Uh-huh.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.425
No, I don't- Oh, damn it!

01:00.010 --> 01:02.418
Mommy didn't mean that. No.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.422
No, everything's fine.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.841
Kate's just a little cranky.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.305
Yeah.

01:09.687 --> 01:13.021
No, I'm feeling better.

01:13.358 --> 01:15.931
Yeah, the incision's healed.

01:16.152 --> 01:19.189
Okay, sweetie. Okay.

01:20.490 --> 01:21.771
Oh, my God!

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.926 --> 01:40.551
When did the pain start?

01:40.761 --> 01:43.762
- Few minutes ago.
- Get an EKG.

01:48.478 --> 01:51.479
Mr. Rollins, where does it hurt?

01:53.483 --> 01:54.811
What?

01:56.653 --> 01:57.732
Let go of my hand.

02:01.199 --> 02:02.991
Never mind, Kit.

02:06.204 --> 02:08.031
Unless you have a problem-

02:08.247 --> 02:09.826
- I do.
- What?

02:10.584 --> 02:14.285
- I'm bored.
- Well, at least you're still alive.

02:14.505 --> 02:19.416
Oh, you mean unlike that poor woman
they say I raped and murdered?

02:19.635 --> 02:24.013
- We both know the truth.
- I'm innocent until proven guilty.

02:24.181 --> 02:27.930
And the DA can't prove jack.
Thanks to you.

02:28.770 --> 02:32.221
If I could do things again,
believe me, I would.

02:33.149 --> 02:35.356
You would've let me die?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.665
- Where'd you get it?
- Patient gave it to me.

03:33.879 --> 03:35.208
- Pretty.
- Yeah.

03:35.422 --> 03:37.830
Lucy, got a good case here.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.925
Valerie Page, 24,
dilated cardiomyopathy...

03:42.138 --> 03:44.594
...recent progression of symptoms.

03:44.766 --> 03:49.143
Difficulty breathing.
Cardiologist changed her medication.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.604
- Throwing PVCs.
- And lift, gently.

03:52.774 --> 03:56.357
- I'm on the transplant list.
- How shall we proceed?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.609
- Call Services.
- Run of five.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.823
- Lucy, what should we do?
- Get the vitals.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.276
BP's 95/60. Heart rate's 110.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.780
BP's stable, not hypotensive.
Treat with lidocaine?

04:07.998 --> 04:09.576
- Right.
- She's in V-tach!

04:09.792 --> 04:12.627
- The paddles!
- No! Check the vitals again.

04:12.795 --> 04:16.081
BP's 95/60. Heart rate's 160.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.627
- Lucy?
- I don't know.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.415
75 of lidocaine.
2 mg drip.

04:20.636 --> 04:25.014
With normal mentation, lidocaine
is still your first treatment.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.095
It's not a good idea to shock
an awake patient.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.722
Back to normal signs.

04:29.938 --> 04:32.144
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.144
I wasn't planning on this.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.109
We'll maybe get you home in time
to open presents.

04:40.073 --> 04:41.271
Lucy?

04:41.825 --> 04:44.447
Lily, draw the labs.
Chuny, order an echo.

04:44.661 --> 04:46.488
Call me back with the results.

04:46.663 --> 04:49.997
You do not know enough
to make those promises.

04:50.209 --> 04:51.240
Her meds were off.

04:51.502 --> 04:55.120
She'll be lucky if she makes it
through the night.

04:56.424 --> 04:57.586
I didn't realize.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.291
You've accumulated a lot of knowledge.

05:00.511 --> 05:03.678
Apply it. Go back,
get a thorough history.

05:03.848 --> 05:06.635
Find out what you can do for her.

05:12.274 --> 05:13.602
Hey, what's wrong?

05:13.817 --> 05:16.771
Nothing.
Thanks for covering transplant.

05:16.987 --> 05:20.486
Sure. It means I can spend
Christmas with Reece.

05:20.699 --> 05:24.282
- At least some will be enjoying it.
- What about you?

05:24.495 --> 05:28.078
Mark's in San Diego
helping his father move.

05:28.290 --> 05:32.419
But with Romano gone,
it seems like a holiday, doesn't it?

05:32.628 --> 05:33.659
You're right. It does.

05:33.879 --> 05:36.335
Detective Cruson's on the phone.

05:36.549 --> 05:39.550
I've got a consult.
Call me with that appy.

05:42.764 --> 05:44.555
Hello, this is Corday.

05:45.892 --> 05:49.095
Yes. Yes, I just saw Mr. Rollins.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.892
I see.

05:53.316 --> 05:56.935
- I discharged the otitis.
- One down, 30 to go.

05:57.154 --> 06:00.986
Whoa! These lights
are a fire hazard!

06:03.410 --> 06:07.539
- Always this busy on Christmas?
- Like the mall after Thanksgiving.

06:07.748 --> 06:10.073
- I need a break.
- We all do, Amira-

06:10.251 --> 06:14.794
- It's Ramadan, I gotta pray.
- Okay. Yosh, cover for her.

06:17.759 --> 06:18.790
What's in your bag?

06:19.010 --> 06:23.090
Secret gifts, if you've been good.
Have I gotten yours yet?

06:23.206 --> 06:25.890
I'll give it to you before I leave.

06:25.901 --> 06:31.429
Anything to help make working
Christmas Eve a little less painful.

06:31.606 --> 06:35.058
- Did I mention I wanted a Gameboy?
- Yes!

06:35.611 --> 06:38.814
Dr. Weaver, it's not too late
to get in on this.

06:39.031 --> 06:41.486
Actually, there's nothing that I need.

06:43.744 --> 06:48.074
- Excuse me.
- Yes, gentlemen, how can I help you?

06:52.461 --> 06:54.454
Now you need some scrubs.

06:55.465 --> 06:57.956
Cardiomyopathy diagnosed
three years ago...

06:58.134 --> 07:00.672
...after the flu on her 21st birthday.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.002
Some present.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.757
There's an LV ejection
fraction of 10 percent.

07:05.976 --> 07:10.436
Doesn't that meet the criteria
to upgrade her for transplant?

07:10.647 --> 07:13.601
I'll call UNOS and tell them
to move her to level one.

07:13.817 --> 07:17.649
- They're ready for you in the O.R.
- I'll be right there.

07:17.863 --> 07:22.157
Go over everything with her.
See if Cardiology has a bed.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.947
Level one?
That means I'm a shoo-in, right?

07:27.164 --> 07:29.834
There's no guarantee for availability.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.334
A girl can dream.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.256
You know, I almost went to med school.

07:39.636 --> 07:40.798
What changed your mind?

07:41.679 --> 07:45.013
- Hospitals smell.
- I hear you.

07:45.517 --> 07:48.637
I opted for a master's
in fine arts instead.

07:48.854 --> 07:53.183
- I'm supposed to graduate in June.
- Really? Me too.

07:55.486 --> 07:57.312
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

07:59.615 --> 08:01.524
If you don't get a new heart...

08:02.326 --> 08:03.357
...yeah.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.710
We went over to Marty's
for some eggnog.

08:11.919 --> 08:14.956
Hasn't anyone ever warned you
about raw egg?

08:15.173 --> 08:18.043
- At least we got to our deliveries.
- Charity?

08:18.259 --> 08:21.379
No. Just a bunch
of Wall Street sharks.

08:21.554 --> 08:24.591
We take gifts to shelters
to keep us human.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.050
We could use a Mrs. Claus.

08:27.227 --> 08:31.889
- I could use a hot bath.
- Dr. Weaver as Mrs. Claus?

08:33.357 --> 08:34.557
Hold it, Carter.

08:34.777 --> 08:40.020
Compazine rectal suppositories
for all the Santas. And rehydrate.

08:40.241 --> 08:41.650
Bah humbug.

08:42.243 --> 08:46.537
- You look like hell.
- I'm midway through a double shift.

08:46.747 --> 08:48.028
You drew the short end?

08:48.249 --> 08:53.077
No, I figured I'd let people
spend some time with their families.

08:54.547 --> 08:55.923
Chad?

08:58.510 --> 09:00.337
Chad, wha-? Chad.

09:00.553 --> 09:03.127
- Get off of me!
- Chad, it's Dr. Finch.

09:03.348 --> 09:04.890
What happened?

09:05.100 --> 09:07.306
He took a header down the stairs.

09:07.519 --> 09:10.189
Watch his neck! Watch his neck.

09:11.565 --> 09:14.732
- His foot got caught.
- Did he lose consciousness?

09:14.943 --> 09:17.269
Maybe. He's pretty messed up.

09:17.446 --> 09:19.355
On what? On what?

09:19.573 --> 09:20.771
- I gotta go.
- Wait!

09:20.950 --> 09:23.405
- Hang in there, dude.
- No, Tony!

09:25.288 --> 09:27.494
Chad, do you have any neck pain?

09:27.790 --> 09:31.040
- Does your neck hurt?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

09:31.252 --> 09:32.912
Get a C-spine just in case.

09:35.381 --> 09:40.091
Pupils equal, reactive to light.
No midline tenderness.

09:40.303 --> 09:42.629
BP's 140/90. Pulse 68.

09:42.848 --> 09:47.474
Talus shifted and rotated.
I need to reduce the deformity.

09:47.644 --> 09:51.642
I need a right-ankle films
and a non-contrast CT.

09:51.815 --> 09:54.306
- Get a B.A.L. and tox screen.
- Got it.

09:54.652 --> 09:57.736
Call the mom.
Phone number's in the old chart.

09:57.947 --> 09:59.939
You're hurting me. Stop it.

10:00.157 --> 10:01.984
It's okay. You'll be okay.

10:04.328 --> 10:07.579
- Ouch!
- That's a delicate injury, indeed.

10:07.790 --> 10:11.159
We were in line to see Santa,
and Tommy had to go.

10:11.336 --> 10:14.835
I always tell him to look down
before you zip up.

10:15.006 --> 10:16.382
I wanna see Santa!

10:16.591 --> 10:18.714
We're gonna have to cut it off.

10:18.885 --> 10:19.916
What?!

10:20.470 --> 10:22.012
I meant the zipper.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.420
I'll get the tray.

10:24.641 --> 10:26.266
I wanna go back to the mall!

10:26.476 --> 10:30.771
Tommy, I have to clean the area.
This may sting a little.

10:32.691 --> 10:34.850
Hold onto him. Tight.

10:38.322 --> 10:39.353
Pickup and Metz.

10:40.950 --> 10:43.108
- Go away!
- I can't watch.

10:43.327 --> 10:45.367
Okay, Tommy. This is gonna pinch.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.537
Ouch!

10:48.583 --> 10:50.374
All done. All done.

10:50.543 --> 10:53.034
Is he gonna be okay down there?

10:53.254 --> 10:55.959
He's gonna be as good as new.

10:56.174 --> 11:00.124
Okay, Tommy, it's all over. So brave.

11:00.887 --> 11:03.046
- Dr. Benton?
- I'm doing an appy.

11:03.223 --> 11:07.221
I've been doing research
on Valerie Page's condition.

11:07.394 --> 11:08.425
Watch the sterile field.

11:08.604 --> 11:12.732
I found articles on
a Left Ventricular Assist Device.

11:12.900 --> 11:13.979
What about it?

11:14.193 --> 11:18.061
A device could keep the blood
pumping until a transplant.

11:18.281 --> 11:20.273
- Not an option.
- Why not?

11:20.491 --> 11:23.576
No device.
County isn't using that yet.

11:23.645 --> 11:26.630
A clinical trial starts as of January.

11:26.648 --> 11:29.237
Her heart won't hold out that long.

11:29.351 --> 11:32.787
We transfer her to Rush.
The program's running.

11:33.254 --> 11:36.421
- Try and arrange it. Let me know.
- Thanks.

11:36.591 --> 11:40.589
- Hey, doc. Taking me on a trip?
- You could say that.

11:41.346 --> 11:44.680
- Why's he here?
- You'll be transferred to jail.

11:44.892 --> 11:48.343
This is a joke, right?
You getting back at me?

11:48.562 --> 11:51.349
They found evidence
linking you to another murder.

11:51.565 --> 11:55.859
- Wait a minute. Look, stop!
- Put him in restraints!

11:56.070 --> 12:00.020
- Bitch! You cannot do this to me!
- Oh, yes, I can!

12:00.783 --> 12:05.492
- Screw you! Ow!
- Okay, spare me the theatrics.

12:05.705 --> 12:07.828
Oh, my leg. My leg, it's cramped.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.828
And I'm the queen of England. Goodbye.

12:11.002 --> 12:12.033
Damn it, it hurts!

12:12.212 --> 12:15.083
Dr. Corday, wait.
His right leg is dusky.

12:15.298 --> 12:18.549
It's like somebody's jabbing
me with needles.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.512
- How long have you had this?
- Just started.

12:22.890 --> 12:27.053
Can't feel a pedal pulse.
No popliteal pulse either.

12:27.269 --> 12:29.428
- Want an angiogram?
- I suppose so.

12:29.647 --> 12:32.980
- Would you hurry up? It's killing me.
- Shut up!

12:38.990 --> 12:40.188
Excuse me.

12:40.408 --> 12:43.991
- Fill out a form, take a seat.
- I work here.

12:44.204 --> 12:48.747
It's about time you brought
those bundles of joy for a visit.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.829
- Hi, Haleh.
- It's Auntie Haleh. Yes, it is.

12:52.128 --> 12:53.587
I'm not visiting.

12:53.797 --> 12:56.169
Look at them. They're adorable.

12:56.341 --> 12:59.176
Look, you're almost back to your-

12:59.386 --> 13:02.008
Hold it, guys.
Kate's not feeling well.

13:02.222 --> 13:04.548
Is there an Attending free?

13:04.767 --> 13:09.180
Let's find out. We'll take
good care of her. Don't worry.

13:09.396 --> 13:11.354
I'm not worried.

13:11.565 --> 13:16.311
But she may not make it through
the night. Yeah, me too.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.071
Rush turned you down?

13:18.281 --> 13:21.780
They can't take her until tomorrow.
No cardiac beds.

13:21.993 --> 13:23.535
Christmas. Bummer.

13:23.703 --> 13:28.199
Is it possible to get
surgical equipment transferred?

13:28.416 --> 13:31.583
- We do it between ERs.
- What do you do?

13:31.795 --> 13:34.831
Get a transfer form
and a doctor's signature.

13:35.882 --> 13:39.299
- The mall's closed now.
- It's not fair!

13:39.511 --> 13:41.219
One more pin should do it.

13:41.513 --> 13:46.389
- Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
- Santa!

13:46.602 --> 13:49.437
Oh! Careful down there, little Tommy.

13:49.647 --> 13:53.396
Santa's so sorry that
he missed you at the mall.

13:53.568 --> 13:56.189
He hears that you've been
a good boy.

13:56.404 --> 13:59.690
- You're not Santa.
- Sure he is, sweetheart.

13:59.991 --> 14:02.909
The Santa at the mall
was fat with glasses.

14:03.119 --> 14:05.445
- This is Santa's brother.
- Go away!

14:05.664 --> 14:08.949
- Tommy, stop it!
- Santa's got a toy for you, Tommy.

14:10.210 --> 14:12.915
I want the real Santa!
The one at the mall!

14:13.130 --> 14:17.044
Okay, Tommy. Santa's gotta go now.

14:17.259 --> 14:21.672
But he wants to wish you
a very merry Christmas!

14:21.889 --> 14:24.214
- What do we got?
- Yo, Santa.

14:24.642 --> 14:27.975
Taylor Sparks, 15.
GSW to left shoulder, drive-by.

14:28.187 --> 14:31.022
Vitals stable, BP's 140/90,
pulse 100.

14:31.232 --> 14:33.901
- Get that out of my face!
- Abdomen's benign.

14:34.110 --> 14:36.981
- How many shots?
- Punk-ass emptied a clip.

14:37.155 --> 14:40.322
Roll him, see if there are
other entry sites.

14:40.492 --> 14:43.825
Trauma panel. Chest and left shoulder.

14:44.037 --> 14:45.994
Back looks clear.

14:46.206 --> 14:50.073
- Whoa! Ho, ho, ho.
- Malik?

14:50.293 --> 14:52.998
- Not the present I had in mind.
- That's mine.

14:53.213 --> 14:57.460
If the vessels are intact,
we'll leave the bullet in.

14:57.676 --> 14:58.755
Give me my piece!

14:58.969 --> 15:01.507
Whatever happened
to "peace on earth"?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.472
You tell us, Santa.

15:04.767 --> 15:07.223
Hey, you're being a very good girl.

15:07.436 --> 15:11.268
- Temperature's 100. 1.
- It was 99.8 earlier.

15:11.482 --> 15:12.727
When was that?

15:12.942 --> 15:17.189
Two hours ago. It takes that long
to get us out of the house.

15:17.405 --> 15:21.355
- She'd be warm from being bundled up.
- Am I being crazy?

15:21.576 --> 15:24.613
No, it's good you brought her in.

15:24.829 --> 15:28.364
A fever in a four-week-old
can be cause for concern.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.538
I know all the things
that can go wrong.

15:31.753 --> 15:34.873
If you'd like,
we can do a septic work-up.

15:35.090 --> 15:37.760
- Is that necessary?
- Probably not.

15:37.968 --> 15:41.088
But you need to make that decision.

15:42.973 --> 15:46.140
- As a nurse I would say no.
- And as a mother?

15:46.352 --> 15:48.641
I wanna make sure everything's okay.

15:48.855 --> 15:51.559
How about we get a urine and CBC...

15:51.733 --> 15:54.769
...but hold off on an LP
till we get the labs?

15:54.986 --> 15:59.031
I want you to draw her blood.
You're the best in the ER.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.992
- I'll be nice and gentle.
- Okay.

16:04.579 --> 16:06.038
How're you feeling?

16:06.248 --> 16:10.246
- My mom here?
- Not yet. Chad, is your father around?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.833
Sure, saw him yesterday.

16:13.046 --> 16:17.294
Christmas photo of him
and his new family vacationing.

16:18.636 --> 16:20.628
I'd like to call him.

16:20.846 --> 16:24.595
He doesn't care. Me and Mom
are better off without him.

16:25.768 --> 16:27.262
When can I go home?

16:28.229 --> 16:30.103
We're waiting on test results.

16:30.273 --> 16:33.440
- Come on. It's Christmas.
- Cleo?

16:43.662 --> 16:46.532
Oh, Dr. Finch. How is he?

16:46.832 --> 16:52.039
Chad has a dislocated right ankle.
We're waiting to rule out head trauma.

16:52.588 --> 16:55.791
Oh, my God!
I don't know how this happened.

16:55.966 --> 16:58.837
- I thought he was upstairs.
- You were home?

16:59.053 --> 17:01.461
I had people over. Holiday party.

17:01.681 --> 17:03.139
Did you hear Chad fall?

17:03.349 --> 17:06.220
There was music playing.
People talking.

17:06.978 --> 17:10.678
Your son has a
blood alcohol level of 0.26.

17:11.816 --> 17:14.486
- Were you aware he was drinking?
- No.

17:16.154 --> 17:18.823
All right, I let him have one beer.

17:19.031 --> 17:22.069
- It's Christmas Eve.
- He's had more than one.

17:22.285 --> 17:24.325
Maybe he took some from the bar.

17:26.999 --> 17:28.659
You think this is my fault.

17:28.876 --> 17:30.500
No, I'm not blaming-

17:30.711 --> 17:34.543
I should've known.
What kind of a mother am I?

17:34.757 --> 17:36.833
Why don't you go in to see him?

17:53.026 --> 17:56.193
"PEDIATRICS"
"E.R."

18:04.037 --> 18:07.288
- What have we got?
-71, MVA, on his way to mass.

18:07.499 --> 18:08.875
- I hit Mary.
- Mary?

18:09.084 --> 18:13.034
As in Virgin Mother.
He drove into a nativity.

18:13.255 --> 18:14.418
I passed out.

18:14.632 --> 18:16.921
Complaining of abdominal pain.

18:17.134 --> 18:20.503
BP is 100/60, pulse 90.
Alert at the scene.

18:20.721 --> 18:25.597
Okay, here we go. Nice and
easy, on my count. One, two, three.

18:25.810 --> 18:29.511
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest films, spin a crit.

18:29.731 --> 18:32.056
Can you tell me where the pain is?

18:32.275 --> 18:37.186
Around my belt. I only wear this
suit once a year. It doesn't fit.

18:37.405 --> 18:38.568
Pulse ox is 95.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.112
- Ultrasound.
- Find something?

18:41.326 --> 18:45.573
Yeah, pulsatile mass
on the left side below the ribs.

18:45.789 --> 18:47.165
Could be an aneurysm.

18:47.374 --> 18:52.250
There's a good chance you'll
need surgery to repair your aorta.

18:52.463 --> 18:55.084
- Anyone we should contact?
- There's no one.

18:55.299 --> 18:58.086
Call the O.R.
Tell them to prep a room.

18:58.302 --> 19:00.591
There's a blockage in your artery.

19:00.805 --> 19:03.426
A clot is preventing blood flow.

19:03.641 --> 19:07.425
This is potentially life-threatening
and needs surgery.

19:07.645 --> 19:10.101
I'm not letting you fix me up...

19:10.273 --> 19:13.891
...so they can put me on trial
for bogus charges.

19:14.110 --> 19:17.895
Then you'll be set free.
Without surgery, you'll die.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.866
Yeah? Well, I'll take my chances.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.484
Besides, you know, I like it here.

19:23.704 --> 19:27.452
Good drugs, food's not half bad.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.125
I get off just looking at you.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.332
You know, every night
after the lights go out...

19:36.551 --> 19:38.294
...I lie back...

19:38.511 --> 19:41.845
...and think about you.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.637
Your answer's no to surgery?

19:48.396 --> 19:51.979
- That's right.
- You'll need to sign a refusal paper.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.398
Bring it on.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.397
- Merry Christmas.
- What's that?

19:59.616 --> 20:03.745
I had an L-VAD transferred here
for Valerie Page.

20:03.954 --> 20:08.497
- That's a $50,000 device.
- I signed your name as the physician.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.826
- What?
- You were in surgery.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.790
- You should've interrupted me.
- No time.

20:14.006 --> 20:16.213
- I can't do it.
- What do you mean?

20:16.425 --> 20:19.510
I mean I'm not qualified to do it.

20:19.679 --> 20:23.013
- Dr. Romano is the only one.
- This could save her.

20:23.183 --> 20:25.508
I'm not qualified. I'm sorry.

20:30.190 --> 20:32.017
- What?
- Nothing.

20:34.569 --> 20:36.895
He's in V-tach! Grab the paddles!

20:37.698 --> 20:39.240
Charge to 100.

20:39.783 --> 20:41.194
And clear!

20:43.537 --> 20:45.613
Two hundred! Come on! Come on!

20:45.831 --> 20:47.409
Not charged yet.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.000
And clear!

20:50.336 --> 20:51.367
Crank it to 360!

20:52.255 --> 20:53.797
And clear!

20:56.592 --> 21:00.044
- He's back. He's back.
- I saw her.

21:00.847 --> 21:04.927
- What?
- Edith, my wife. I saw her.

21:05.143 --> 21:07.716
- She's not here.
- I know. She's dead.

21:07.938 --> 21:09.052
But I saw her.

21:10.524 --> 21:11.638
I saw her.

21:13.151 --> 21:16.236
- Heard about your Santa performance.
- My last.

21:16.405 --> 21:19.572
Malik's Gameboy.
Didn't wanna hear his griping.

21:19.742 --> 21:21.070
You're a good woman.

21:21.243 --> 21:24.244
Mom, no need to ruin
your Christmas too.

21:25.122 --> 21:28.242
I gotta go, okay? Bye.

21:28.459 --> 21:30.167
Any word on Kate's labs?

21:30.378 --> 21:34.791
Her urine is negative
and white count is basically normal.

21:35.007 --> 21:36.336
"Basically"?

21:36.551 --> 21:41.047
The differential shows five bands.
But that's still normal.

21:41.264 --> 21:43.340
Can't the lab repeat them?

21:43.558 --> 21:47.638
- That means sticking Kate again.
- Can we do a manual diff?

21:47.854 --> 21:51.473
I'll call the lab supervisor
to squeeze one in.

21:51.692 --> 21:52.890
Thanks.

21:53.151 --> 21:57.778
- How are you holding up?
- In all honesty, I'm exhausted.

21:57.990 --> 21:59.104
I'm not surprised.

21:59.325 --> 22:02.610
I can handle 40 patients,
but not two infants.

22:02.828 --> 22:05.663
- That's parenthood.
- Maybe he's out of town.

22:05.873 --> 22:10.950
Dr. Romano, this is Lucy Knight.
Fourth-year medical student.

22:11.170 --> 22:15.120
Yes, I realize that it's
almost midnight, but-

22:15.300 --> 22:17.969
- It's about a patient.
- It's Christmas!

22:18.136 --> 22:21.053
Yes, sir. I understand that. But-

22:21.264 --> 22:25.476
- chief of staff at home!
- If I could- Hello?

22:29.356 --> 22:30.684
I want my piece back.

22:31.233 --> 22:33.771
Your gun is now police property.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.477
It was a present for my little bro.

22:36.655 --> 22:40.570
- You were gonna give him a gun?
- Cost me serious dollars.

22:41.368 --> 22:43.824
- How much?
- Forty. Now give it back.

22:43.996 --> 22:48.041
- I gave it to the police.
- What am I supposed to give him?

22:48.501 --> 22:52.333
Here. It's a Gameboy.
Worth at least twice that much.

22:52.547 --> 22:55.667
- Your brother'll love it.
- Yeah, whatever.

22:59.721 --> 23:01.180
Merry Christmas!

23:01.389 --> 23:05.138
I'm caught between a rock
and a hard place on this.

23:05.352 --> 23:08.269
- How so?
- Mrs. Kottmeier cares about her son.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.264
But he needs more.
She's an alcoholic herself-

23:12.484 --> 23:17.823
That only factors in if it interferes
with her ability to care for Chad.

23:18.032 --> 23:19.905
What if she buys his alcohol?

23:20.117 --> 23:23.985
- Did he say that to you?
- No, she did, in so many words.

23:27.333 --> 23:30.868
- Peter, did you consent Mr. Waller?
- Yeah. Why?

23:31.212 --> 23:32.790
Better get in here.

23:42.808 --> 23:44.884
Please, no surgery.

23:45.102 --> 23:47.474
You have a life-threatening
condition.

23:47.688 --> 23:50.724
I'm not afraid to die. I saw Edith.

23:51.442 --> 23:53.730
- His dead wife.
- She waits for me.

23:53.902 --> 23:55.895
I saw her at the end of a tunnel.

23:56.071 --> 24:00.568
- And there was this white light?
- Yeah, it was so peaceful.

24:00.785 --> 24:05.613
You experienced an hallucination
due to an endorphin release.

24:05.832 --> 24:07.741
No, it was real.

24:07.917 --> 24:11.084
If this isn't happening,
I have a pain consult.

24:11.296 --> 24:16.456
If you don't have surgery, you
probably won't live through the night.

24:17.427 --> 24:20.428
That means we can
spend Christmas together.

24:23.809 --> 24:25.636
I'm sorry.

24:26.603 --> 24:28.513
- I really tried.
- I know.

24:28.730 --> 24:31.482
If there was anything I could do,
I would.

24:31.692 --> 24:35.476
Don't worry.
I plan on beating this thing...

24:35.696 --> 24:39.279
...with or without some stupid device.

24:39.909 --> 24:43.610
Okay. Get some rest.
Keep your strength up.

24:50.628 --> 24:52.372
Merry Christmas.

24:53.423 --> 24:55.416
Merry Christmas, Valerie.

25:06.645 --> 25:11.603
Breast-feeding was so hard at first.
I felt like a cow with huge udders.

25:11.817 --> 25:16.147
- You look like a natural.
- Being that I do it every three hours.

25:16.322 --> 25:18.196
When do you sleep, girl?

25:18.407 --> 25:21.658
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay. The kitchen's closed.

25:21.869 --> 25:25.950
- Auntie Haleh should get back to work.
- May I?

25:26.916 --> 25:30.451
- Thanks for the chair.
- OB won't miss it.

25:32.964 --> 25:36.748
The manual diff came back.
Kate's white count is normal.

25:36.968 --> 25:40.883
That's great. You hear that, sweetie?
You'll be okay.

25:41.098 --> 25:45.226
Probably just a virus.
Not too surprising, this time of year.

25:45.435 --> 25:47.974
- I'm sorry I've been-
- A good parent?

25:48.188 --> 25:51.937
- No. I was gonna say difficult.
- Yeah. Same thing.

25:55.237 --> 25:59.022
- I can't believe it's 2:00 a. m.
- Yeah. It's Christmas.

25:59.242 --> 26:02.693
That's right. It's Christmas.

26:03.287 --> 26:04.912
I admitted him to ICU.

26:05.123 --> 26:08.124
Donald, what are you
doing here this late?

26:08.334 --> 26:12.546
I had a gastroenteritis turn
into an ischemic bowel on me.

26:12.714 --> 26:14.588
Merry Christmas.

26:14.883 --> 26:18.169
So shall we include Elizabeth
in on your dilemma?

26:18.387 --> 26:21.506
A patient's refusing surgery
because he thinks...

26:21.723 --> 26:24.261
...he saw his dead wife
waiting for him.

26:24.476 --> 26:29.055
My patient's refusing surgery too.
But mine's the devil incarnate.

26:29.273 --> 26:31.764
- Dean Rollins?
- Good riddance.

26:31.984 --> 26:36.777
- Who made you judge and jury?
- You don't know how despicable he is.

26:36.989 --> 26:41.984
I'm sure I don't. But being a doctor
isn't about your personal feelings.

26:42.203 --> 26:45.572
- Let's get back to your patient.
- He won't listen.

26:45.748 --> 26:48.868
But did you listen?
He's probably frightened.

26:49.085 --> 26:52.086
Seeing his dead wife
makes him feel less so.

26:52.255 --> 26:57.001
If he thought you understood that,
he'd be more receptive to you.

26:57.219 --> 27:00.089
- It's the patient's choice.
- Of course.

27:00.305 --> 27:04.173
But we must offer to do
all we can to keep them alive.

27:06.770 --> 27:10.720
Okay, Gretel! Okay, you can stop now!

27:10.941 --> 27:12.733
You've got my attention!

27:12.943 --> 27:17.938
Before you speak, I have a dozen
reasons why I shouldn't be doing this.

27:18.116 --> 27:20.867
For one, I don't wanna ruin my career.

27:21.077 --> 27:22.868
The police are coming-

27:23.079 --> 27:27.373
I have a patient, Valerie Page,
24, dying of cardiomyopathy.

27:27.584 --> 27:30.501
She's on UNOS.
An L-VAD could buy her time.

27:30.712 --> 27:33.120
And you think I give a rat's ass?

27:34.341 --> 27:37.924
I'm sorry. What was I thinking,
coming to you...

27:38.136 --> 27:42.384
...a seasoned doctor who supposedly
has dedicated his entire life...

27:42.599 --> 27:45.470
...to helping people?
I'm just a puny student...

27:45.686 --> 27:48.972
- ... who stupidly thought she could-
- Miss Knight.

27:50.566 --> 27:52.108
What do you want?

27:53.152 --> 27:56.272
I want you to help my patient.

27:57.156 --> 27:59.149
I want you to help me.

28:02.996 --> 28:06.946
- Where's the fat dude in the red suit?
- There are many here.

28:07.167 --> 28:11.663
- The one giving out the Gameboys.
- Chuny, I got this. Hi.

28:11.880 --> 28:17.171
- We heard you give Gameboys for gats.
- Well, that's not exactly true.

28:17.386 --> 28:21.847
It happened once, but that
was sort of a unique situation.

28:22.141 --> 28:23.421
We out of here.

28:24.685 --> 28:27.971
Well, wait.
Does it have to be Gameboys?

28:28.981 --> 28:32.979
Hey, Vivian.
I'm looking for my triple-A.

28:33.152 --> 28:37.649
- The guy who saw his dead wife.
- Howard Waller? Over there.

28:39.909 --> 28:43.076
- He died?
- He coded less than an hour ago.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.941
- You miss me?
- I'm curious about something.

29:17.156 --> 29:22.447
Me too. Are you a natural redhead?
I'd like to see for myself.

29:23.371 --> 29:27.784
You're willing to be a vegetable
for the rest of your sad life...

29:28.001 --> 29:29.543
...for a pissing contest.

29:29.753 --> 29:33.537
Well, that's one contest with you
I'm sure I can win.

29:35.676 --> 29:38.879
Without surgery,
the flesh on your leg will rot.

29:39.096 --> 29:43.426
- Become infected, probably gangrenous.
- You're scaring me, doc.

29:43.642 --> 29:47.225
Next comes septic shock.
Your BP will be so low...

29:47.396 --> 29:49.722
...you will have a massive stroke.

29:49.899 --> 29:54.810
You'll wind up drooling in your food,
wearing diapers.

29:55.238 --> 29:57.610
Rather like that pathetic man.

29:57.824 --> 30:02.451
Except you'll only have one leg
because they'll have to amputate.

30:03.330 --> 30:05.785
But you'll have won, Dean Rollins.

30:09.044 --> 30:13.623
Now, is that really
the best you can do?

30:15.217 --> 30:20.460
It's the truth. If you don't believe
me, you'll only have yourself to blame.

30:21.724 --> 30:25.307
You do care about me. Don't you?

30:26.520 --> 30:31.598
- As your doctor, I do.
- No, not as a doctor. As a woman.

30:33.736 --> 30:35.279
Say it.

30:37.615 --> 30:38.647
Say it.

30:43.163 --> 30:44.657
I care.

30:49.545 --> 30:51.336
Then let's do it.

30:59.221 --> 31:02.804
Crappy generator.
That Amish salesman will hear it.

31:03.017 --> 31:06.682
- What do you need a generator for?
- T.E.O.T.W.A.W.K.I.

31:06.854 --> 31:09.772
- The End Of The World As We Know It.
- Y2K.

31:09.983 --> 31:14.027
Computers rule us.
Doesn't take a genius to see our doom.

31:14.195 --> 31:18.573
Aftercare instructions:
change that dressing in 24 hours.

31:18.783 --> 31:21.357
Haven't they fixed the Y2K glitches?

31:21.578 --> 31:26.536
One pebble can make ripples. You can
bet this place'll be a deathtrap.

31:26.708 --> 31:31.785
I assure you, Mr. Thorpe, our mainframe
has been thoroughly Y2K-inspected.

31:32.006 --> 31:35.505
They check the interface
with front-end terminals?

31:35.718 --> 31:37.378
I don't know.

31:38.220 --> 31:41.755
I'm gonna show you how well
you've been inspected.

31:42.516 --> 31:46.977
Your CT came back negative,
which means no injury to your brain.

31:47.438 --> 31:50.108
- Thank God!
- So I can go home now?

31:50.316 --> 31:54.480
I'm afraid not. I've made
arrangements for you to be placed...

31:54.696 --> 31:58.480
...in an alcohol-treatment program
here in the hospital.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.322
- You did what?
- You can't make me stay.

32:01.536 --> 32:04.822
My duty is to ensure
your well-being and safety.

32:05.082 --> 32:07.454
- Mom?
- Please don't do this to us.

32:07.668 --> 32:11.119
- I'll try harder.
- He's lucky now. What about later?

32:11.338 --> 32:15.751
- I won't get drunk again.
- Believe me, it's for your own good.

32:15.926 --> 32:17.718
I just wanna go home.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.508
Please, Dr. Finch.

32:21.015 --> 32:26.176
I beg you, don't take him from me.
It's Christmas, for God's sakes!

32:26.396 --> 32:30.180
He's at a greater risk.
No school, partying with friends.

32:30.483 --> 32:34.944
I promise I won't drink again.
I promise. Please.

32:35.155 --> 32:38.405
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

32:39.284 --> 32:40.743
It's all right.

32:41.411 --> 32:45.658
Now, go to the month pull-down
and change it to January 2000.

32:45.874 --> 32:49.160
- Hit "apply." And then "okay."
- Done.

32:49.378 --> 32:52.083
Now try to retrieve my medical chart.

32:52.298 --> 32:56.627
I'm sure we'll convince you
we run a tight ship here at County.

32:56.802 --> 33:00.670
"No records found
for December 25, 1900."

33:00.890 --> 33:05.102
1900? What did you do?

33:05.311 --> 33:08.312
- Get Tech Support!
- I'm leaving while I can.

33:08.523 --> 33:10.931
- You gave it away?
- For a good cause.

33:11.151 --> 33:15.528
- That was my Secret Santa gift.
- I'll get you another one.

33:15.739 --> 33:20.365
- They're taking you for a ride.
- That's four less guns out there.

33:20.577 --> 33:24.741
There's a horde of troublemakers
asking about gifts for guns.

33:24.957 --> 33:26.866
- Thanks.
- You're still here.

33:27.084 --> 33:29.124
- Where's her mom?
- Try Exam 2.

33:29.336 --> 33:30.581
Thanks.

33:43.601 --> 33:45.927
Keep Exam 2 clear for a while.

33:46.145 --> 33:47.391
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

33:47.605 --> 33:51.437
I can't believe we don't have
24-hour tech support.

33:51.651 --> 33:54.356
- Romano's getting a memo.
- It's Christmas.

33:54.571 --> 33:58.403
Y2K is seven days away.
They should be here.

33:58.617 --> 34:00.942
- Computer problems?
- It crashed.

34:01.161 --> 34:05.788
- I can't get labs or medical records.
- Mind if I take a look?

34:06.000 --> 34:09.867
No! That's how I got into trouble
in the first place.

34:10.087 --> 34:13.456
The terminal's current.
It's a software problem.

34:13.674 --> 34:17.126
I could download a Y2K patch.
That should fix it.

34:17.594 --> 34:20.679
I guess you can't
make things any worse.

34:22.016 --> 34:24.424
I feel the catheter sliding.

34:25.228 --> 34:28.846
- There's some minor resistance.
- I'll give you suction.

34:30.984 --> 34:33.605
It'd be so easy for me to just slip.

34:33.820 --> 34:36.987
Oh, at least he's gonna
have to stand trial.

34:38.824 --> 34:42.870
Okay, I've got the clot.
Shirley, check the foot.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.408
911 page to O.R. 3?

34:48.085 --> 34:50.456
- Why's Romano here?
- I feel a pulse.

34:50.670 --> 34:53.875
Good. Get an angio,
check for arterial tears.

34:54.091 --> 34:57.176
- Can you finish here?
- I've come this far. Go.

34:57.387 --> 35:00.091
Look for ventricular decompression.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.764
With a transesophageal echo,
the septum will bow.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.934
Fourth-year, huh? Not bad.

35:06.855 --> 35:10.900
Nice to see when the cat's away,
the mouse still jumps.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.272
What's going on?

35:12.444 --> 35:15.196
I'm demonstrating
an L-VAD implantation.

35:15.405 --> 35:19.783
From now on, I'll only do favors
for people who beg at my door.

35:19.952 --> 35:22.787
Which leads me to ask,
why wasn't it you?

35:22.955 --> 35:25.872
- Never considered it.
- O ye of little faith.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.408
Again, I want to thank you for-

35:28.627 --> 35:32.328
That's enough sucking up. Cut.
That'll be all, Peter.

35:33.674 --> 35:36.130
- Can I scrub in?
- You didn't earn it.

35:36.302 --> 35:39.054
- I still want to help.
- What do you think?

35:39.264 --> 35:43.842
- She can use all the help she can.
- You heard her, Peter. Scrub in.

35:48.607 --> 35:51.608
The '60s were from 1961 to 1970.

35:51.818 --> 35:54.654
- And 1960?
- The last year of the '50s.

35:54.863 --> 35:57.983
So the new millennium
really starts in 2001.

35:58.158 --> 36:01.492
Why am I spending my paycheck
on New Year's Eve?

36:01.662 --> 36:05.161
- You and the rest of the world.
- Sleeping Beauty.

36:05.374 --> 36:09.158
- That felt great! How long was I out?
- About four hours.

36:09.337 --> 36:12.254
It felt like days. Where are the kids?

36:12.465 --> 36:15.038
Asleep in Pedes. Yosh is on duty.

36:15.259 --> 36:18.842
- I appreciate you helping me.
- What are friends for?

36:19.013 --> 36:21.551
- Christmas cookie?
- Yeah, I'm famished.

36:21.766 --> 36:24.851
- I heard about Kate. Is she okay?
- She's fine.

36:25.061 --> 36:28.146
- Where you off to?
- Indianapolis to see family.

36:28.356 --> 36:31.357
- Did Kottmeier go upstairs?
- A few minutes ago.

36:31.526 --> 36:34.860
- Merry Christmas, Kwanza, all that.
- Safe travel.

36:35.030 --> 36:39.858
- I'm sorry I can't give you a ride.
- You've done enough for us already.

36:40.035 --> 36:42.194
Carol, I can give you a ride.

36:42.371 --> 36:46.286
- Since when do you own a car?
- Since I sold my boat.

36:46.500 --> 36:51.209
- Thank you, no. The girls are asleep-
- Look who's up. Come on!

36:51.380 --> 36:53.919
Oh, come here, sweetheart. I know.

36:54.133 --> 36:56.624
All right. I'm gonna get our stuff.

37:35.218 --> 37:36.760
Quite an arsenal.

37:36.970 --> 37:41.798
After I gave away the Secret Santa
gifts, I started writing checks.

37:42.017 --> 37:45.267
Call the police,
have an officer pick them up.

37:45.479 --> 37:49.559
- I already did.
- Double trauma at the back door.

37:52.194 --> 37:57.189
Drive-by victim, 17. Single GSW to
the thigh. BP is 130/90. Pulse 110.

37:57.366 --> 37:59.275
- Name's Hank Lohman.
- Lohman?

37:59.493 --> 38:01.320
Carter, take the next one.

38:01.537 --> 38:04.206
Seven-year-old. GSW to the chest.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.784
- Lost the pulse en route.
- Get ET tube placement.

38:08.544 --> 38:12.673
Took a bullet aimed at his neighbor,
the guy just brought in.

38:12.882 --> 38:14.127
Son of a bitch!

38:14.592 --> 38:17.878
Two units of O-neg
and prep for a thoracotomy.

38:18.054 --> 38:21.221
- He's in fine V-fib.
- Pupils fixed and dilated.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.841
Let's prep his chest. Oh, my God!

38:24.061 --> 38:28.058
- Where's the blood coming from?
- They shot him in the head.

38:28.232 --> 38:30.723
- How're you doing?
- Full traumatic arrest.

38:30.901 --> 38:33.902
- Thoracotomy tray is ready.
- Chest is prepped.

38:34.071 --> 38:38.863
There's gray matter all over
this backboard. He's dead.

38:47.585 --> 38:50.337
Okay. The pump is de-aired.

38:50.546 --> 38:53.713
Decrease bypass flow
to two liters per minute.

38:53.925 --> 38:58.967
Start the L-VAD.
Fixed mode, 20 cycles per minute.

38:59.181 --> 39:01.932
- The moment of truth.
- It works.

39:02.601 --> 39:06.052
- You're surprised?
- It's loud. How will she sleep?

39:06.271 --> 39:10.732
She'll get used to it.
Just like hearing your own heart beat.

39:11.360 --> 39:15.572
- Pump is filling nicely.
- Isn't that your munchkin out there?

39:15.781 --> 39:18.153
You mind if I scrub out?

39:18.367 --> 39:22.495
You want in, you want out.
I know, it's Christmas. Get out.

39:22.705 --> 39:26.406
- Thanks.
- Miss Knight, care to help me close?

39:27.043 --> 39:28.206
Sure!

39:28.419 --> 39:30.792
- You feel up to it?
- Absolutely.

39:31.881 --> 39:36.508
I know I was supposed to get him
earlier, but this surgery came up.

39:36.720 --> 39:40.053
Save it. It's nothing
I haven't heard before.

39:40.265 --> 39:44.726
Carla, it is the holidays.
We could at least try to be civil.

39:46.355 --> 39:49.439
You want civil? Fine.

39:50.859 --> 39:53.896
Thank you very much
for ruining my life.

39:54.113 --> 39:58.905
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Roger and I aren't moving to Germany.

39:59.493 --> 40:02.660
- What?
- He asked for time off for the trial.

40:02.872 --> 40:06.786
His boss decided he wasn't
promotion material after all.

40:07.710 --> 40:12.207
- Look, I don't know what to say.
- I'm sure you don't.

40:14.342 --> 40:17.593
I'm sorry about Roger's job.
But I'm not sorry...

40:17.804 --> 40:21.054
...Reece gets to stay here
with both his parents.

40:21.308 --> 40:22.968
Whatever, Peter.

40:23.602 --> 40:26.936
You won. Merry Christmas.

40:37.491 --> 40:41.157
Hey, Amira?
I'm expecting an officer to stop by.

40:41.329 --> 40:44.199
How about... that one?

40:45.083 --> 40:46.328
What happened?

40:46.501 --> 40:49.455
One punk shot another,
killed a kid instead.

40:49.671 --> 40:53.206
Caught him fleeing the scene
with a cut on his head.

40:53.425 --> 40:57.886
- It's you?
- You thought I couldn't score another?

40:58.680 --> 41:00.222
You want a gun?

41:00.432 --> 41:03.350
I got guns.
Why don't you take your pick?

41:03.519 --> 41:07.433
Shoot it and bang!
A 7-year-old's brains get splattered.

41:07.648 --> 41:11.397
- What do you think you're doing, John?
- Merry Christmas!

41:15.740 --> 41:18.195
We'll see how long this lasts.

41:18.451 --> 41:20.657
They had quite a night.

41:20.870 --> 41:24.405
Their first Christmas ever.
It's hard to believe.

41:24.624 --> 41:27.708
It only happens once. Enjoy it.

41:29.129 --> 41:32.462
Luka, wait.
Do you have any Christmas plans?

41:32.883 --> 41:36.715
- Like those two over there. Sleep.
- Stay for eggnog.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.589
It's the least I can do.

41:38.805 --> 41:41.890
And end up like those Santas?
I don't think so.

41:42.059 --> 41:47.516
- Come on. It's tradition.
- What's in that eggnog exactly?

41:47.731 --> 41:51.776
- Eggs, sugar, milk, rum-
- Rum?

41:51.986 --> 41:55.355
You know what?
I suppose I can risk it, eh?

42:00.036 --> 42:03.950
Next few days, a bland diet.
Clear fluids, rice, bread...

42:04.165 --> 42:07.285
- Your computer running okay?
- Yes! Thank you.

42:07.502 --> 42:11.286
- I appreciate it.
- Santa always aims to please.

42:11.506 --> 42:14.080
You know a place to get bland food?

42:14.259 --> 42:17.094
Doc Magoo's is right
across the street.

42:17.262 --> 42:20.180
And you can't get
much blander than that.

42:20.390 --> 42:24.720
- They're open on Christmas?
- Always open, just like us.

42:24.937 --> 42:26.977
Sounds perfect. Thanks.

42:29.233 --> 42:30.858
Dr. Weaver.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.985
Care to join us?

42:35.531 --> 42:37.026
My treat.

42:39.535 --> 42:41.777
Free bland food...

42:41.955 --> 42:44.576
- Sure.
- Great.

42:53.258 --> 42:55.963
So, you work with computers, huh?

42:56.178 --> 43:00.721
Yeah. I own my own software company.
Just went public.

43:00.933 --> 43:05.642
Really? I'm always looking
for investment opportunities.

43:07.064 --> 43:11.394
We split the breastbone,
so your chest will hurt for a while.

43:11.611 --> 43:15.988
- That's a small price to pay.
- So how's our lovely patient?

43:16.199 --> 43:19.983
She's great. Pressure's up,
kidney function's improving.

43:20.203 --> 43:23.654
Good. Carry on. I'm going back
from whence I came.

43:23.832 --> 43:26.868
You'll have to come
by my office next week...

43:27.085 --> 43:29.244
...to discuss disciplinary action.

43:29.463 --> 43:33.128
Nothing personal. I do have
a reputation to maintain.

43:37.221 --> 43:39.344
What was that all about?

43:39.682 --> 43:41.176
Nothing.

43:42.476 --> 43:45.762
I cannot thank you enough, Dr. Knight.

43:47.148 --> 43:48.690
I'm not a doctor yet.

43:50.193 --> 43:52.019
You are to me.

43:55.740 --> 43:58.611
God, I am so tired now.
