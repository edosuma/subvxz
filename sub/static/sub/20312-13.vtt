00:01.293 --> 00:02.920
[school bell ringing]

00:02.920 --> 00:05.547
[Gerry] Open your books, please.

00:07.716 --> 00:13.430
All right, we're going
to talk about the atomic bomb.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.475
-Hey, sir?
-[Gerry] What Jimmy?

00:16.475 --> 00:20.312
I heard the heat from the
Atomic blast can cause burns
from five miles away.

00:20.312 --> 00:24.316
-Yes, that is true.
-I also heard it killed over
one million raccoons.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.568
[class laughs]

00:28.362 --> 00:32.324
[laughter]

00:32.324 --> 00:34.660
-That's funny.
-[laughter]

00:34.660 --> 00:37.997
Oh, that's funny to you, Harry?
Your name's Harry.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.415
I've never said a word
that your name is Harry.

00:40.415 --> 00:44.085
I come in once, with sunburn.

00:44.085 --> 00:49.717
Hairy Harry is his name,
comes in every day like hairy.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.805
-Hairy!

00:54.805 --> 00:57.349
♪ I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie ♪

00:57.349 --> 01:00.101
♪ I'm awesome
I'm driving around
in my mom's ride ♪

01:00.101 --> 01:03.146
♪ I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by ♪

01:05.190 --> 01:07.860
♪ I'm awesome ♪

01:10.445 --> 01:12.907
-All right, thank you.
-Are you home tonight?

01:12.907 --> 01:15.242
No, big practice.
Big game this week.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.911
Yeah, I heard,
it's in all the papers.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.162
It's big for me Bill. Do you
know what happens if I win?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.415
Bobbi's going to let me coach
senior boys...

01:21.415 --> 01:24.167
You were right. I do not care.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.963
-Oh, my God!
-What are you doing?

01:27.963 --> 01:29.715
It's Kate, remember
I told you about Kate?

01:29.715 --> 01:31.926
-Yeah. Can you get up please?
-Is she gone?

01:31.926 --> 01:33.844
-Yeah, she's gone.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.722
Oh, I don't feel like seeing
her right now.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.599
She's doing some job
interview process here.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.436
Kate! From college,
you proposed to her.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.397
Kiss Cam, 20,000 people
watched you get rejected.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.274
-Yeah, okay.
-That's hilarious.
I remember you telling me.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.359
-Oh, you still like her.
-No, I don't still like...

01:49.359 --> 01:51.862
-Yeah you do.
-All right, this is pointless.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.655
Say hi to your
girlfriend for me.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.743
-Hello, Bill.
-Oh, hey.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.412
Gerry was telling me there's a
staff party at Barrels tomorrow.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.205
You going?
-Ah, no.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.999
I have a lot of work
to catch up on.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.627
-You work too much.
-Yeah, but I bet
you'll be there?

02:06.627 --> 02:10.714
-No, I have a date.
-Maybe I will go then.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.094
-I'm growing on ya!
-Yeah, like a fungus.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.764
-Have a good day, okay?
-Bye, mommy.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.476
-Bye-bye.
-Here she is, Jean, Jean,
the Scottish machine.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.896
-Hello, Gerry.
-Hey, you coming
to Kira's game tomorrow?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.940
I wouldn't miss it.
It is just a thrill

02:27.940 --> 02:30.943
to watch Kira
on the bench, every time.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.070
All right, that's sarcasm.
But she doesn't bounce the ball.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.280
She just walks with it,
so I can't play her.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.449
I get it, I'll see you
at the game.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.452
Hey, we have a staff social
tomorrow, why don't you
come with me?

02:40.452 --> 02:43.789
That sounds like a date. And
our last date if you remember...

02:43.789 --> 02:46.125
-Hey, Gerry.
What's going on?
-What are you doing Norman?

02:46.125 --> 02:47.835
Get out of here.
I'm talking to somebody.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.253
-Sorry about that.
-It's all right.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.213
-Come with me.
-Yeah, you should come.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.842
-I'm gonna go. Okay.
-It will be fun.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.927
-Can you not see I'm in the
middle of something?
-Thanks for introducing me.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.554
-I'm not gonna...
-So rude, Gerry.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.140
That's rude!

03:02.474 --> 03:04.768
Overall, pretty great
performance review.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.228
Well, tip of the hat
to you, sir.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.815
Let me just say what a pleasure
it is to serve under you.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.527
As your right hand man and
the drain in the bathtub of...

03:13.527 --> 03:17.405
-All right, enough Robert.
-Thank you, thanks.

03:17.405 --> 03:21.326
There is one small thing.
You do have one staff complaint.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.286
What the? Who? What?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.455
They say you tend to blow
things out of proportion.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.666
-Judas.
-It's not that big of a deal.

03:27.666 --> 03:31.210
It's just one little thing
to work on,

03:31.210 --> 03:33.588
in an otherwise
exemplary review.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.550
-If you say so, sir.
-So you'll take care of the rest
of the staff reviews?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.219
Oh, I'll take care of the other
staff, don't you worry.

03:42.097 --> 03:45.475
-Mr. Duncan, may I have a word?
-Okay I know what this is about.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.561
-It's about Kate.
-This isn't about Kate.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.937
I have some sad news.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.857
Coach Summers at St. Pat's
has passed away.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.817
Yes. No!

03:53.817 --> 03:56.528
So obviously your game
tomorrow night is gonna
have to be cancelled.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.322
All right.
So we win by forfeit.

03:59.322 --> 04:03.326
-In the grand scheme
of things, I guess.
-Oh, Coach Sutters!

04:03.326 --> 04:04.828
-Summers.
-What's the name?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.538
-Summers.
-Coach Summers!

04:06.538 --> 04:08.790
Look, you're gonna have
to talk to your team.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.751
-Okay.
-I would suggest sensitivity.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.377
Maybe we could get some
grief counselors.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.337
If I tell them
the game's cancelled,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.215
they get all sad and stuff.

04:16.215 --> 04:19.509
I'm not talking about the game.
I'm talking about Coach Summers.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.220
This could be traumatic
for them.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.264
I'll tell them it was suicide,
because then they'll think

04:24.264 --> 04:26.558
-he wanted to die.
-He had a heart attack.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.937
How many trips to the buffet
did Mr. Summers make?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.813
And he smoked. Suicide.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.359
-Trudy, review time.
-Yup.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.904
-Was it you who said it?
-Said what?

04:38.904 --> 04:41.949
-The complaint.
-What are you talking
about Robert?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.410
-Come on! Callaghan told me.
-Told you what?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.914
That somebody said that I
overreact to the little things.

04:48.914 --> 04:52.709
-Was it you?
-No, Robert. It was not me.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.128
-Really?
-Really.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.046
If I was going to complain
about you, I'd start

04:56.046 --> 04:59.299
with how you can't
file anything properly.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.260
And you don't understand
personal space.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.677
But you didn't say
anything to Callaghan

05:02.677 --> 05:05.555
about me overreacting
to the little things?

05:05.555 --> 05:08.225
God help us all if you're
having one of your lonely days.

05:08.225 --> 05:11.103
Thank you for not saying I blow
things out of proportion.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.604
Yup.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.898
-Bobbi!
-Yeah?

05:14.898 --> 05:17.358
That's sad news about Summers
from St. Pat's.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.070
-Why are you smiling then?
-Well, it's kind of good news
for me though, right?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.696
Because now I get to coach
senior boys volleyball.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.031
What are you talking
about Gerry?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.950
You said if I had
two wins this year,

05:24.950 --> 05:26.660
I could coach senior boys
volleyball next year.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.370
-You still only have one win.
-Two, they just forfeited.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.082
No, it doesn't work like that.
You don't record a game you
never played.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.708
-So what?
-Forfeited, what does that mean?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.711
-It's a win.
-No, it's a forfeit.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.672
It means you didn't play.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.509
-What if I got the game back on?
-Okay, their coach just died.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.512
The whole school is in mourning.
There's not gonna be a game.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.931
-You think I killed their coach?
-No!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.309
Then why are you talking to me
like I killed him?

05:50.309 --> 05:51.810
I know you didn't kill him.
Jeez.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.770
Well, hypothetically then.
If we played the game,

05:53.770 --> 05:56.731
and we won, would I coach senior
boys volleyball next year?

05:56.731 --> 06:00.359
Sure, sure. Hypothetically, you
need this? Hypothetically, sure.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.779
-Sounds good.
-Unbelievable.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.579
Principal Davis? Mr. Duncan
from Xavier Academy is here
to see you.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.999
-Thank you.
-Yeah, thanks.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.710
Wow, it's like the oval office,
Mr. Obama.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.837
[laughing]

06:18.837 --> 06:20.714
So, what can I do
for you today?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.717
First of all, condolences on
the passing of Coach Summers.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
-That's sad.
-Oh thank you.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.764
Sudden heart attack.
Overweight, smoker.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.934
-What are you going to do?
-Hopefully, you don't smoke.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.355
Um...

06:36.355 --> 06:38.732
I just think we should
play the game, sir.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.860
I came here because I just
think it's the right thing
to do for the girls.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.444
-I don't know.
-Your girls, my girls.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.323
I wouldn't put the girls
through it, they're just
too down.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.908
If they lost, they'd be crushed.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.659
I mean, they haven't
won a game all year.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.036
This is not the time
to play.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.746
It would be what
the coach wanted.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.915
I'll start my subs.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.043
Are you telling me you're
willing to throw this game?

06:58.043 --> 07:01.838
I never said that.
Is there dust in my eye?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.715
Are you telling me
that the fix is in?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.884
I never said that.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.387
-I, uh, I think I see what
you're getting at.
-[Gerry] Yeah?

07:08.387 --> 07:12.724
Well, you know a victory
would be good for this team
and the school morale.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.519
-Win one for...
him, Coach Summers.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.398
You know what?
Game's back on! Thank you.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.316
-You are one selfless man.
-Thank you.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.651
-I appreciate this.
-We'll try a little bit,
so it's not staged.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.779
Oh, yeah, you don't want to make
it look like it's fixed.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.074
-No, perfect. Thank you.
-No. All right,
see you at tipoff.

07:32.411 --> 07:35.705
Before we start practice,
a little bit of great news.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.167
-I got our last game back on!
-[girls] Yes!

07:39.167 --> 07:41.544
[Kira] Maybe I'll get to play.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.047
Better than get to play Kira,
you're going to start the game.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.675
-Yes!
-[Gabby] I wouldn't want
to play if you died, sir.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.387
-I'm not going to die, Strap.
-Everybody dies, Gerry.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.056
I'm not going to die
anytime soon, Mr. Hunt.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.933
Sooner than any of us though.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.269
Not if a meteor hits us
on the way to the game.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.896
Kills all of us at once.
Instantaneously.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.066
-You ever think of that?
-I do. Every day.

08:03.066 --> 08:07.070
All right, are we done this?
Come on! Big game!

08:07.070 --> 08:09.323
Let's go, 20 laps.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.532
Why would St. Pat's
agree to play?

08:11.532 --> 08:14.702
Let's just say in so many
words, I told them we'd lose.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.331
-How many words?
-I said we'd start our subs.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.749
-And will we?
-Yeah, but then I'm going
to pull them right away.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.252
-I'm not gonna
leave them in there.
-Gerry, that's not right.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.004
Do you like 7:00am
practices outside?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.340
So if I win I get senior boys
volleyball next year.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.301
I'm gonna need an assistant
coach and you can apply.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.471
-So there, let's win.
-I can't support this.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.932
Support what?
Simon, where are you going?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.352
Okay, well don't come crawling
back to me when we win.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.603
-What are you doing?
-I did a lap.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.897
-No, 20 laps.
-I can only do one.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.942
-What do you want from me?
-[quietly] Oh boy.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.908
-You seem a little nervous.
-[laughs nervously]

08:53.908 --> 08:59.914
Um, well, A: you're creeping
me out and B: A.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.876
Ms. Mason, what would you say
your worst quality is?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.379
Well, I was told recently
that I work too much.

09:05.379 --> 09:09.632
Funny, because I would have
said your worst quality
is betrayal.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.759
-Betrayal?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.762
Why...why would you say that?

09:14.762 --> 09:18.475
Here's your review.
Why don't you read it aloud?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.601
"Since I always counted
Ms. Mason amongst

09:20.601 --> 09:24.022
my closest friends and
legal beneficiaries..."

09:24.022 --> 09:25.899
-Yeah.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.568
"...I was hurt to learn
she told Principal Callaghan

09:28.568 --> 09:30.945
that Robert Cheeley blows..."

09:30.945 --> 09:34.991
There's a page break.
There's more.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.410
"...things out of proportion."

09:36.410 --> 09:39.787
Robert, I never said any
of these about you.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.664
I don't think that you blow
things out of proportion.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.292
You know me so well.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.294
But it does beg the question:

09:46.294 --> 09:50.424
If it wasn't you who said those
things then who was it?

09:50.424 --> 09:54.928
Mr. Leung.
It's always Leung.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.847
Thank you, Ms. Mason.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.771
All right, how are we feeling?
It's a big game.

10:04.771 --> 10:08.233
Nervous. We've never played
in front of this many people
before, sir.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.859
What if we lose?

10:09.859 --> 10:12.153
I'm getting pizza tonight
after the game.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.697
That's great, Kira.
We're not gonna lose.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.784
Did you see them in warm up?
They're not a strong team.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.036
They don't look ready to play.
They're not into this game.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.456
-Is it because their coach died?
-Okay, look.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.791
Whether they're coach is dead or
alive right now doesn't matter.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.293
Don't start feeling
sorry for them.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.044
I'm so confident we're
gonna win this game,

10:28.044 --> 10:30.297
I'm gonna start
Kira and Lucy.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.591
-[Kira and Lucy] Yes!
-Not for long,
just gonna start.

10:32.591 --> 10:35.427
Gonna go in, probably
pull ya out.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.805
All right? Okay, have a seat.
We'll get started here.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.477
-Hey.
-Mr. Duncan.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.228
Hi.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.689
Um, I just thought we'd have a
short memorial

10:48.689 --> 10:50.984
for Coach Summers
before tipoff.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.278
That's a great idea.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.030
Girls? Team, come on over.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.284
He looks like a good guy.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.954
Ladies and gentlemen, I want
to say a few words

11:02.954 --> 11:05.290
about Coach Summers
before the game.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.334
The world became a darker place

11:07.334 --> 11:10.420
the day the flame went out
for Coach Summers.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.256
The coach, he loved life.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.049
And he loved this team,

11:15.049 --> 11:17.969
but most of all,
he loved winning!

11:17.969 --> 11:20.847
All right, so let's win
this one for the coach!

11:20.847 --> 11:24.518
-Yeah! What do you say? Yeah!
-[crowd applause and cheers]

11:24.518 --> 11:28.062
-Yeah!
-[applause continues]

11:28.062 --> 11:30.106
Can I say a few words?

11:30.106 --> 11:33.026
Hi, my name is Mr. D.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.196
Mr. Duncan from Xavier Academy.
I'm the coach there.

11:36.196 --> 11:40.033
It's never easy
to come play a game

11:40.033 --> 11:43.286
when you've lost such
a good, good person.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.247
I remember my first experience
with death.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.792
I was given a bird
by my parents, probably
your age girls.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.338
Tiny bird, Chico, little Chico.

11:53.338 --> 11:57.008
And, Chico died because I forgot
to feed him for a few days.

11:57.008 --> 12:00.053
So I buried Chico in my backyard
and days went by.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.888
I was missing him,
so I wanted to see him.

12:01.888 --> 12:06.434
I didn't know about the whole
thing, concept of decomposition.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.645
I dug up Chico, it wasn't Chico.

12:08.645 --> 12:13.149
No, it was not Chico.
It was remnants of Chico.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.943
You ever eat a quarter chicken
dinner and you're done?

12:15.943 --> 12:18.238
You take all the meat off.
That's what it looked like.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.114
Just what was left.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.158
I know you'd love to see your
coach right now.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.703
But trust me, you do not
want to go dig him up.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.414
Because you know what
you'll find?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.250
You'll find a quarter chicken
dinner. Or a whole chicken.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.502
I mean he's...

12:32.502 --> 12:34.713
Did you guys see
the movie Buried?

12:34.713 --> 12:37.215
Like, that is...
I'm claustrophobic.
Is he claustrophobic?

12:37.215 --> 12:40.719
That, to me, is worse than
dying. 'Cause you're gonna die.

12:40.719 --> 12:44.013
I think about that. I think
a lot about being buried alive.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.142
Because it's just, being
claustrophobic, that's something
that, it's your worst fear.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.895
So, what I tell my family
and friends is I say,

12:50.895 --> 12:54.482
bury me, but put a baby monitor
in the coffin you know the part?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.151
The base? You have the
receiver at the top.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.779
So if I wake up and I wasn't
dead, I could talk to people.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.907
And hopefully someone's
walking around the graveyard.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.992
People always do.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.704
I'd ask that we have a minute
of silence if that's okay.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.623
Just to honor,
pay our respects.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.874
Bow our heads please, girls.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.502
To honor and pay our respects
to Coach Summers.

13:14.502 --> 13:20.675
Start... wait... wait...
start now.

13:22.969 --> 13:27.181
That's five seconds so far.
55 more seconds.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.768
Fifty... seconds left.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.312
You know what? Let's just do
ten seconds of silence.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.148
Because we only have the gym
for two hours I think?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.318
So, let's play some ball
for Coach Summers.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.988
[Gerry claps]

13:43.740 --> 13:47.118
I trust you'll find this
review interesting.

13:47.118 --> 13:50.246
Now, is there anything else
you'd care to share?

13:50.246 --> 13:53.124
Feelings you've maybe expressed
about me, behind my back?

13:53.124 --> 13:55.543
-Excuse me?
-Oh, come on, Wayne.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.587
Go ahead, just tell me.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.922
Just tell me exactly how it is
you really feel about me.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.133
Very well.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.290
That's how you make me feel.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.251
That right for Malik, also.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.046
[whispers] Peace.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.174
-[cheering]
-[Gerry] Good job, good job.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.468
Set it up, good.
Watch behind you.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.721
Watch the pick.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.348
Good, here we go. Here it is,
right there, yup. Yup! Yup! Yup!

14:50.348 --> 14:54.143
-Yes! Get back, get back.
-[Crowd cheers]

14:57.188 --> 14:59.399
Nice!

15:01.484 --> 15:04.738
-What are you doing?
-Sir, when do I get to play?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.447
I only got to play
for ten seconds.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.949
And in that ten seconds,
we were down four nothing.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.536
What's my Kira rule?
When does Kira play?

15:11.536 --> 15:15.874
If we're winning by 60 points
or losing by 60 points,
Kira gets to play.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.167
And that's not the situation
we're in.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.879
Mom! Did you get the pizza
for later today?

15:20.879 --> 15:23.715
Kira, we're right in the middle
of a game, okay? Sit down.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.258
-Don't worry about pizza.
-[Kira] Okay.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.763
No! that's it, that's it.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.558
What's going on here Duncan?
I thought you said you were
going to play your subs.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.935
I said I'd start my subs
and I did that.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.896
It's not my fault your girls
are not into this game.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.647
Come on, man.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.567
Full court pressing 11-year-old
girls who's coach just died?

15:42.567 --> 15:45.194
That's embarrassing.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.322
Eighteen-oh run,
that's embarrassing.

Ref time out. Time out. Come on
in girls. Come here. Come here.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.149
We've really got them on
the ropes huh, sir?

16:23.149 --> 16:26.152
Yeah, we do.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.738
Kira, you and Lucy are going to
go in the rest of the game, OK?

16:28.738 --> 16:32.283
-[Kira and Lucy] Yes!
-But, sir, we're not winning
by 60 points.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.994
Look, when you're older you'll
understand what I did there.

16:34.994 --> 16:40.082
But for now, you need to
understand that sometimes
you need to lose to win.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.919
-That's bull--!
-Sit down.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.547
What do I do, sir?

16:46.547 --> 16:49.049
Just do what you always do,
that ought to do it.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.261
Just have fun.
Get in there.

-Yeah?
-Actually... nothing.

reviews go?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.995
-Great.
-Good.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.245
I mean, they went okay.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.248
I guess when you're dealing
with a bunch of backstabbers
you never really know.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.584
Let me guess, you spent the
entire day trying to figure out

17:23.584 --> 17:26.086
who it was that said you blew
things out of proportion?

17:26.086 --> 17:28.798
-It was Gerry, wasn't it?
-It wasn't Gerry.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.842
Don't tell me it was sweet
little Simon?

17:30.842 --> 17:33.887
-It was me.
-It was you?

17:33.887 --> 17:36.681
Yes, it was.
And I was right.

17:36.681 --> 17:40.393
You blew it way out of
proportion and you
let it affect your job.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.520
[chuckles]

17:42.520 --> 17:46.816
You are so right. That's
exactly what I did. Thank you,

17:46.816 --> 17:51.070
-yet again, for teaching me
another valuable lesson.
-Okay.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.574
-[final buzzer sounds]
-[crowd cheers]

17:56.784 --> 18:00.538
All right girls.
Look, I'm really proud
of what you just did.

18:00.538 --> 18:04.458
-Why, sir? We lost.
-I know, Lucy, but do you
know why you lost?

18:04.458 --> 18:06.544
-Is it because you played Kira?
-No.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.671
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Okay.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.214
In a round about way, yes,

18:10.214 --> 18:13.051
it's because I played Kira.
That's why we lost.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.219
-Okay, go get changed.
-[Gabby] Good job, Kira.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.638
-[Lucy] Yeah, good job.
-[Kira] Shut up!

-I thought you had a date.
-No, I cancelled.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.397
And what about you?
You were supposed to work.

18:26.397 --> 18:30.985
Well, I figured, maybe
for once, I could come
out and have a little fun.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.862
-All right, let's do that then.
-[Lisa laughs]

18:32.862 --> 18:36.407

about how nice that was.

Did you see what I did?

19:13.527 --> 19:16.363
-Yeah.
-Sad so, I did it
for the school.

Yeah, you know what? The
more you're talking about it.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.951

for me, so...
