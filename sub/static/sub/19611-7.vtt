WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:05.030
I found out she was
chatting with a guy,

00:05.030 --> 00:07.170
and she sent someone money.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.340
Uh-oh.

00:08.340 --> 00:09.900
- When we met,
I was going through a lot,

00:09.910 --> 00:11.440
and he was the only one
there for me.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.840
I don't know what I would do
if I lose that.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.580
-<i> We can drive to Little Rock.</i>
<i> It's not that far.</i>

00:17.580 --> 00:19.810
[knocking]
Hello?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.420
- This is creepy.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.650
<i> [tense music]</i>

00:22.650 --> 00:25.150
They love me, but they don't
want to see me.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.030
- Hello?

00:31.030 --> 00:33.990
<i> Yeah, hotel room basketball.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:36.200
- Welcome to the game.
You can do dunks and stuff.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.470
- I can do whatever I want.

00:38.470 --> 00:40.630
Let's do a shootout.
- Okay, fine.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.840
<i> [exciting music]</i>

00:42.840 --> 00:45.170
[both sigh]

00:45.170 --> 00:48.180
- Wait, oh--
[crowd oohs]

00:48.180 --> 00:50.110
One, two.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.250
[sighs]

00:51.250 --> 00:52.410
- Oh!

00:52.420 --> 00:54.150
- Hello, you want me
to block him? Okay.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.220
Oh!
- Oh, that was perfect!

00:58.850 --> 01:00.420
[buzzer sounds]
- Did you get it?

01:00.420 --> 01:02.520
- I don't think so.
[laughter]

01:02.530 --> 01:03.920
I got dizzy.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.489
All right, here we go.

01:05.489 --> 01:07.560
Let's dive in.
We've got an episode waiting.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.360
Ooh, Sandra E.

01:09.370 --> 01:13.570
"I'm convinced this is all
a lie, but she won't listen.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.900
I'm writing you guys on behalf
of my granddaughter, Yasmine."

01:16.910 --> 01:18.640
First time.
- Wow.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.170
- The first grandmother...

01:20.180 --> 01:22.510
- Writing in about
her granddaughter, nice.

01:22.510 --> 01:25.280
"Yasmine met a guy named Lewis
almost a year ago

01:25.280 --> 01:27.450
"but didn't tell me about it.

01:27.450 --> 01:30.120
"My maternal instinct told me
she was dating someone,

01:30.120 --> 01:33.290
mostly because of how happy
she was on a daily basis."

01:37.290 --> 01:39.390
- "I could tell that
she really cared about him.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.260
"I would sometimes hear her
opening up to him,

01:42.260 --> 01:44.300
"which is something
Yasmine does not do.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.100
"I was unsure where or how
she met him,

01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
"but after much snooping
by yours truly,

01:49.610 --> 01:53.640
I found out she was constantly
chatting with a guy online."

01:53.640 --> 01:55.210
- Granny's picking it up.

01:59.180 --> 02:02.150
- "I was curious if they'd
ever met in person.

02:02.150 --> 02:03.580
"I would constantly ask Yasmine,

02:03.590 --> 02:05.120
"but she would always avoid
my questions,

02:05.120 --> 02:06.950
"so I became really suspicious.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.860
"Until one day
when I found a receipt.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.860
Yasmine sent someone money."

02:13.860 --> 02:15.530
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-oh!

02:15.530 --> 02:17.300
- "I had never heard the name
on the receipt,

02:17.300 --> 02:20.100
"and I wondered who the heck
she's sending money to.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.400
"Once Yasmine got home,
I confronted her about this,

02:22.400 --> 02:25.070
"and that is when
she spilled the beans

02:25.070 --> 02:27.470
"that the money was sent
to Lewis.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.540
"However, the name on
the receipt wasn't Lewis.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.380
"Yasmine admitted that she had
never met Lewis before.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.980
"They had never video-chatted
or anything,

02:34.980 --> 02:36.450
"and I couldn't believe it.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.550
"I know she's still talking
to this liar,

02:38.550 --> 02:41.090
"and I'm afraid she'll
send him more money

02:41.090 --> 02:44.420
"if I don't prove 100%
she is lying.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.990
"I have attached the receipt
Yasmine received

02:47.000 --> 02:48.660
"once she sent the money.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.130
"I really hope you guys
can get to the bottom of this,

02:51.130 --> 02:53.330
as I am desperate."

02:53.340 --> 02:54.540
- Wow.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.440
I love that we're talking
to a grandma.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.370
- Yeah, let's call Granny.
See if we can figure this out.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.810
[ringing]

03:00.810 --> 03:02.880
Hello!
- Hey!

03:02.880 --> 03:04.240
<i> - Hello, Nev.</i>
- Sandra.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.550
<i> - Yes!</i>
- Hey, Sandra.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.810
How are you?
<i> - I'm good.</i>

03:07.820 --> 03:09.720
- The first thing I want to say
is I'm really glad

03:09.720 --> 03:11.690
that you were concerned
about your granddaughter,

03:11.690 --> 03:13.550
and I think you're doing
the right thing

03:13.560 --> 03:16.890
by reaching out to help her
figure out what's going on here.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.060
-<i> Thank you.</i>

03:18.060 --> 03:20.060
- Do you and Yasmine
live together?

03:20.060 --> 03:22.300
-<i> Yes, we do.</i>
both: Okay.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.900
- And how long ago
did you notice her

03:24.900 --> 03:28.400
starting to talk
to this Lewis character?

03:28.400 --> 03:29.700
-<i> Not long ago.</i>

03:29.710 --> 03:32.710
<i> I would say about</i>
<i> six weeks ago maybe.</i>

03:32.710 --> 03:36.610
- You've only been aware
of their dating for six weeks,

03:36.610 --> 03:39.110
or they've only been dating
for six weeks?

03:39.110 --> 03:41.380
-<i> I've been aware of it.</i>
- Right.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.580
-<i> They've probably been</i>
<i> almost a year.</i>

03:43.590 --> 03:44.620
- Whoa.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.390
- And she's already
sending him money.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.260
-<i> Yeah, that's what really</i>
<i> concerned me.</i>

03:48.260 --> 03:50.820
- Is Yasmine in love with him,
do you think?

03:50.830 --> 03:52.460
-<i> She is, as a matter of fact.</i>

03:52.460 --> 03:55.130
- You seem to be so certain
that Lewis is lying to her.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.760
How do you know that?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.900
-<i> I searched and I found a page</i>

03:58.900 --> 04:00.930
<i> with his name on it.</i>

04:00.940 --> 04:02.570
<i> There was some videos on there,</i>

04:02.570 --> 04:04.970
<i> and I showed it her</i>
<i> and she says,</i>

04:04.970 --> 04:06.940
<i> "Well, that's not his voice."</i>

04:06.940 --> 04:08.910
<i> - So I am posting this video--</i>

04:08.910 --> 04:12.080
<i> - And I'm like, okay,</i>
<i> I'm getting somewhere with her,</i>

04:12.080 --> 04:14.480
<i> but she shut down on me again.</i>

04:14.480 --> 04:17.279
<i> I'm getting very limited</i>
<i> information from her,</i>

04:17.290 --> 04:20.490
<i> who's really behind there</i>
<i> on the phone or online,</i>

04:20.490 --> 04:23.460
<i> and, you know,</i>
<i> it's so terrifying</i>

04:23.460 --> 04:25.360
<i> for a parent to go through</i>
<i> something--</i>

04:25.360 --> 04:28.030
- Yeah, no, you're definitely
handling the situation

04:28.030 --> 04:30.230
I think as best as possible.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.700
Does Yasmine know that you've
reached out to us?

04:32.700 --> 04:33.900
-<i> Yes, she does.</i>

04:33.900 --> 04:35.300
- All right, well,
then I guess

04:35.300 --> 04:37.600
we're going to Oklahoma.
- That's right.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.640
-<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>
<i> Thank you so much.</i>

04:39.640 --> 04:41.280
- All right.
- All right, sit tight,

04:41.280 --> 04:43.810
and we will be there soon.

04:43.810 --> 04:45.810
-<i> We'll see you.</i>
- All right, Sandra.

04:45.810 --> 04:46.850
Bye.
- Bye.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.080
-<i> Bye-bye.</i>

04:48.080 --> 04:50.020
- Wow, all right.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.390
I think this is
a not-so-uncommon thing.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.990
- Yeah.
- That parents,

04:53.990 --> 04:56.760
or grandparents in this case
are concerned for their kids.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.260
They live together.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.290
I think she considers herself
a parental figure.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.860
- If you saw your daughter
talking to--

05:02.870 --> 05:05.470
- Oh, man, my daughter
is not going to talk to anybody

05:05.470 --> 05:08.040
on the Internet,
or maybe at all.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.710
Well, I want to figure this out.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.270
Grandma's already found
this Facebook page.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.640
I feel like the investigation
has already begun,

05:16.650 --> 05:18.650
and since we can't leave
for Oklahoma until tomorrow,

05:18.650 --> 05:20.210
why don't we do
a little research right now?

05:20.220 --> 05:21.480
- We can do some searching.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.950
- Yeah, pick up where
Granny left off.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.190
See what we can find.
- Sure.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.420
- All right, cool.

05:26.420 --> 05:27.790
All right.
- Okay, what do we got?

05:27.790 --> 05:29.390
- Let's go to the email
that she sent.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.390
"This is all the information
I have for him."

05:31.390 --> 05:34.190
Lewis lives in Louisiana.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.800
- Why don't we go
to the receipt

05:35.800 --> 05:37.460
and see what the real name was.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.500
- Right.
- Who received the money?

05:39.500 --> 05:41.970
- Rihana.
- Whoa, it's a girl's name.

05:41.970 --> 05:44.400
- Well, she sent 40 bucks,
so...

05:44.410 --> 05:46.640
- Okay, well,
when you're a grandchild--

05:46.640 --> 05:48.340
- Well, right.
- That's a chunk.

05:48.340 --> 05:49.710
- So let's see...
- Received it in Arkansas.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.480
Who that is, right?
- I mean, yeah,

05:51.480 --> 05:53.680
Not that many people
are gonna have that name.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.980
- Arkansas. Ah!
Stuttgart, Arkansas.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.290
She's a part of the story.

05:59.290 --> 06:00.920
- Definitely a part
of the story.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.220
Is she connected to Lewis?

06:02.220 --> 06:03.690
- Oh, yeah.

06:03.690 --> 06:05.260
No, no.
They're not friends.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.530
- Not friends with him.

06:06.530 --> 06:08.030
They have no connection
to each other.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.960
- Let's see if the phone number
gives us a hit.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.070
- Oh!

06:12.070 --> 06:13.400
Arkansas.
- Arkansas.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.170
- El Dorado, Arkansas.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.300
And it gives us a name.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.640
- Lakiesha.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.110
- El Dorado.

06:19.110 --> 06:21.070
But what's El Dorado,
Arkansas?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.680
Is that where Rihana's from?

06:22.680 --> 06:27.580
- Let's see, directions from
Stuttgart to El Dorado.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.650
Uh, hmm.

06:28.650 --> 06:29.980
- 2 1/2 hours away.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.120
Interesting.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.220
- That's kind of far.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.550
Let's do a Facebook search.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.550
- Yep.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.160
- There are a lot of
Lakiesha [bleep].

06:37.160 --> 06:39.060
- Milwaukee.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.130
- Hidden Valley.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.430
- Philly.

06:41.430 --> 06:43.160
Nothing.

06:43.170 --> 06:48.940
- Let's see if Rihana
has a friend name Lakiesha.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.440
Nothing.
- No connection.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.140
- All right, look,
I don't think

06:54.140 --> 06:55.540
whoever Yasmine is talking to

06:55.540 --> 06:57.340
has anything to do
with Lewis Carter.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.880
- I don't think so either.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.050
- So what we need to focus on

07:00.050 --> 07:01.620
is who is she talking to?

07:01.620 --> 07:04.050
The phone number comes back
weirdly registered

07:04.050 --> 07:06.020
to this Lakiesha person,

07:06.020 --> 07:07.190
and the money was sent to...

07:07.190 --> 07:08.490
- Rihana.
- Rihana.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.760
We found her.
We know she's real.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.330
So now we need to figure out
the connection to Rihana.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.030
Is it her?
Is she in love with Yasmine?

07:15.030 --> 07:16.460
- She could have a deep voice.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.270
- Clearly there's something
going on here,

07:18.270 --> 07:21.200
so we need to help her
immediately.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.370
- Look at this,
Max is rolling my suitcase.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.780
- Well, 'cause you've got
the camera.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.240
- This is the first time
Max has ever

07:30.250 --> 07:31.810
done anything nice for me,
I think.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.950
- Oklahoma.
Here we go.

07:44.930 --> 07:47.060
- Did it go in my pocket?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.470
- We made it.
- Yee-haw.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.070
- Yee-haw.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.000
- So Granny Sandra...
- Granny Sandra.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.670
Yasmine, the granddaughter.
- Right.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.340
- She thinks she's dating
this guy, Lewis,

08:02.340 --> 08:05.510
quote-unquote, the guy she's
been talking to for a year,

08:05.510 --> 08:09.320
to whom she has sent
some money, Western Union.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.150
- But...
- The name on the Western Union

08:12.150 --> 08:14.120
was for a girl named Rihana.
- Right.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.020
- Who's in Arkansas.
- There's still a lot

08:16.020 --> 08:19.160
to this story
that we just don't have.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.460
This is it.
- Think this is it.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.300
- Well, hello there.
Nev and Max.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.270
Come on in.
- Come on, guys.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.610
- I want to introduce you
to Yasmine.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.010
- Hello.
Nev.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.380
- Nev.
Oh, of course, Max.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.010
- And that's Max.
- Nice to meet you.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.350
- Nice. So what's going on?
- Give us the grand tour.

08:41.350 --> 08:44.020
Nice, this is where you guys
have your barbecues.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.290
- We do.
- What is this?

08:45.290 --> 08:46.850
- That's my husband's cooker.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.490
He smokes our meat in there.

08:48.490 --> 08:50.860
both: Smoke some meat!
- Yeah.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.160
- R2-D2.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.290
[imitating R2-D2]

08:56.030 --> 08:57.530
[laughter]

08:57.530 --> 08:59.700
All right, let's get down
to business.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.370
So I just want to understand
exactly the relationship.

09:02.370 --> 09:06.240
So you met this guy, Lewis.
- Yeah.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.210
It all started a little
over a year ago now.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.580
We met through this app

09:10.580 --> 09:13.580
to get more followers
and stuff on Twitter.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.680
We were in
one of the group chats,

09:15.680 --> 09:18.690
and I remember
he would constantly

09:18.690 --> 09:20.890
try to catch my attention.

09:20.890 --> 09:23.390
And I guess, like,
his persistence

09:23.390 --> 09:25.230
kinda caught my attention,

09:25.230 --> 09:28.730
and finally I just basically
was like, "Just PM me."

09:28.730 --> 09:32.470
- Okay, and what is Lewis like?

09:32.470 --> 09:34.370
- He's really sweet and caring,

09:34.370 --> 09:36.700
but, like, he has a smart mouth.

09:36.710 --> 09:40.310
Like, he has, like, a comeback
for every single thing.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.980
And it's kinda like what
drew my attention to him,

09:45.980 --> 09:47.780
'cause I'm one
of those people that, like,

09:47.780 --> 09:49.980
I have a smart comeback
for anything you say,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.150
and he was just the only person

09:52.150 --> 09:54.320
that would be like,
"Okay, and?"

09:54.320 --> 09:56.320
- So he's clever.
- Yeah.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.460
You could tell that there
was a connection there.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.560
<i> And it went from</i>
<i> texting all the time</i>

10:00.560 --> 10:03.060
<i> to talking on the phone</i>
<i> all the time,</i>

10:03.070 --> 10:05.430
and I would always say like,
"Hey, I want to meet you.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.400
I want to see you,"
and it was always like,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.240
"Oh, I can't,
my phone's broke.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.140
Oh, I can't,
my laptop's broke."

10:11.140 --> 10:12.570
And then he hits me

10:12.570 --> 10:15.510
with a family member
was in the hospital.

10:15.510 --> 10:18.410
<i> One of his cousins</i>
<i> got into a car wreck,</i>

10:18.410 --> 10:20.850
<i> and he's like,</i>
<i> "I can't go see them,"</i>

10:20.850 --> 10:23.620
and kinda like asked me
if I could help him.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.920
So I ended up sending him money.
- For what?

10:25.920 --> 10:29.190
- For gas money, I guess.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.390
To go to the hospital.
- Okay.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.190
- And I sent, like, $40.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.630
But when I sent him the money,

10:35.630 --> 10:37.500
he hit me with the,

10:37.500 --> 10:41.470
"Oh, I don't have my ID."

10:41.470 --> 10:45.170
Can you send it to this person?

10:45.170 --> 10:47.140
- And did you think
that was sketchy?

10:47.140 --> 10:49.410
- Yeah, I'm not gonna lie,
I did,

10:49.410 --> 10:52.680
but at the time I was,
like, so blinded by love

10:52.680 --> 10:55.250
that, like, any excuse
he woulda gave me,

10:55.250 --> 10:57.580
I woulda just
ran along with it.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.950
And here's where lovely
Grandma comes into play.

11:00.960 --> 11:05.390
By searching the name, she shows
me Facebook videos of Lewis.

11:05.390 --> 11:07.290
- Grandma's handy
with the Facebook.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.700
- [laughing] Yeah.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.830
-<i> Well, it took me</i>
<i> a long time to search,</i>

11:10.830 --> 11:12.330
<i> but I found something.</i>

11:12.330 --> 11:14.330
<i> - I am posting this video...</i>

11:14.340 --> 11:15.740
<i> - I got her attention</i>
<i> with that and--</i>

11:15.740 --> 11:18.170
- Right, and so
when Grandma showed you

11:18.170 --> 11:19.710
Facebook videos of Lewis...?

11:19.710 --> 11:21.440
- I'm like, that's not him.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.380
That voice isn't the same voice,
so I call him,

11:24.380 --> 11:26.310
and I'm like,
"Are you lying to me?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.750
Is your name even Lewis?"

11:27.750 --> 11:30.950
He's like, "No,
my name's actually Milo."

11:30.950 --> 11:33.720
- Milo?
- Yeah.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.460
-<i> He sent a picture,</i>
<i> and then I was</i>

11:36.460 --> 11:38.730
even more confused,
'cause he's, like, cuter.

11:38.730 --> 11:41.030
What?
When does this happen?

11:41.030 --> 11:42.360
- Grandma, did you know
any of this?

11:42.360 --> 11:45.200
- No, I'm just now
finding this out.

11:45.200 --> 11:48.870
- Okay, so there's a lot more
to the story than we thought.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.440
- Yeah.
- Well, yeah.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.340
- Okay, so we know
it's not Lewis.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.340
<i> - Yeah.</i>
<i> - Now he says his name is Milo,</i>

11:54.340 --> 11:56.110
<i> and he sends a new picture.</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

11:56.110 --> 11:57.740
And I'm like, do I believe him?

11:57.750 --> 12:02.120
He's already lied for so long.
So I text Milo.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.620
- Okay.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.820
- And I'm like,
"Tell me the truth.

12:05.820 --> 12:06.850
Quit lying."

12:06.860 --> 12:09.090
And he hits me
with a new picture.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.990
- And he sent you a new photo?
- Yeah.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.560
And it's like this time,
"My name's Blue."

12:13.560 --> 12:15.830
<i> - He said his name was Blue?</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

12:15.830 --> 12:17.930
-<i> This is crazy.</i>

12:17.930 --> 12:19.770
So Milo is not Milo.

12:19.770 --> 12:21.600
Lewis is not Lewis.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.000
We don't know
who this person is?

12:25.010 --> 12:26.440
- Is it another cute boy?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.810
- No.
- No?

12:27.810 --> 12:28.940
- No.
- Oh.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.380
- So it's someone who looks
very different

12:30.380 --> 12:32.710
than Lewis and Milo?

12:32.710 --> 12:33.980
- Yeah.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.650
So now I'm, like,
in a situation of,

12:36.650 --> 12:39.850
do I hang on to something
that I think I love?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.990
'Cause now at this point
I'm just confused.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.720
Or do I just let go
and move on with my life?

12:44.730 --> 12:47.960
And I grew up seeing
the people I love

12:47.960 --> 12:49.260
stay around in situations.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.530
Like, no matter what happens,

12:50.530 --> 12:52.530
you stay with
the person you love.

12:52.530 --> 12:56.340
And in my heart,
I believed I loved him.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.610
So I was like,
you know what, it's fine.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.810
We'll get through this.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.640
- Are you still talking to...
- Blue?

13:03.650 --> 13:06.210
- Blue?
- We were just talking, like,

13:06.210 --> 13:07.880
what, three days ago?

13:07.880 --> 13:10.520
- Very upsetting how much
she's fell for this person,

13:10.520 --> 13:13.950
you know, that's actually
deceiving her.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.190
- You keep talking to him
despite the multiple

13:17.190 --> 13:19.760
different people
he pretends to be,

13:19.760 --> 13:22.700
so clearly your
connection with him

13:22.700 --> 13:26.030
is more important to you
than what he looks like.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.670
- Yeah.

13:27.670 --> 13:31.170
- What is it about this person
that's so important to you?

13:31.170 --> 13:34.610
- I was--when we met,
I was going through a lot.

13:34.610 --> 13:37.880
I had just got out
of a really bad relationship,

13:37.880 --> 13:41.980
and then I was
going through family issues,

13:41.980 --> 13:43.780
and I felt like I had nobody.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.650
And he just helped me
through all of it.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.720
<i> [somber music]</i>

13:49.720 --> 13:53.660
I was supposed to be
the strong one in the family.

13:55.030 --> 13:58.900
In the mix of trying
to be strong, I wasn't.

13:58.900 --> 14:03.540
I wasn't as strong as I was
letting everyone see.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.670
And he was the only one
there for me, like,

14:05.670 --> 14:07.610
"You don't have
to be strong all the time.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.410
It's okay to cry.
It's okay."

14:13.720 --> 14:17.920
He was the only person
that I ever talked to

14:17.920 --> 14:20.720
about my personal life.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.460
I don't know what I would do
if I lose that.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.860
- You have to assume
he's lying.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.160
- I was telling him myself,
"I think you're a catfish,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.430
"but still on the phone
with you, still texting you,

14:31.430 --> 14:33.930
"and still like, 'oh, you don't
want me to go to work today?

14:33.940 --> 14:37.070
Fine, whatever. I'll stay
home and be there for you.'"

14:37.070 --> 14:39.510
- So you skipped work...
- Yeah.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.670
- Because he wanted you
to stay home and talk to him.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.080
- Yeah, because he was like,

14:43.080 --> 14:44.880
"Oh, babe, I'm having
a bad day today."

14:44.880 --> 14:46.710
- I mean,
it's so manipulative.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.980
Look, you're obviously getting
something really important

14:49.990 --> 14:51.650
from this relationship,

14:51.650 --> 14:54.420
but I'm not sure it's worth
what you're giving up.

14:54.420 --> 14:56.220
- Even though he hurts me,

14:56.220 --> 14:58.560
he could help me a lot.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.630
I just want answers.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.800
- All right, so...

15:07.800 --> 15:10.500
let's open up
the old laptop.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.310
So the only real
hard piece of evidence

15:12.310 --> 15:13.970
that we had was the receipt

15:13.980 --> 15:15.940
which had that name
that you sent to Rihana.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.780
- Yeah.
- We wanted to see if we could

15:17.780 --> 15:20.550
find this Rihana,
so we did some searching.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.350
We started on Facebook,

15:22.350 --> 15:24.320
and we found an account
in Arkansas.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.650
Do you know who this person is?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.350
- No.
- No?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.620
- So the next thing we did was
we searched the phone number...

15:29.620 --> 15:31.930
- Mm-hmm.
- That you use to talk to them.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.860
- Yeah.
- And it came back registered

15:33.860 --> 15:36.830
to someone named
Lakiesha [bleep].

15:36.830 --> 15:38.400
- Do you know anyone
with that name?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.670
both: No.

15:39.670 --> 15:42.470
- Possibly from
El Dorado, Arkansas.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.740
Obviously this was
a new name for us.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.040
- Yeah.
- Lakiesha.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.640
- Even though you sent
money to Rihana,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.380
that could be her friend,
it could be her--

15:50.380 --> 15:52.580
- Right, Lakiesha--
- Daughter.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.680
- Or Lakiesha
could be the person

15:54.680 --> 15:56.480
who simply had
the phone number

15:56.480 --> 15:58.350
before the person
who has it now.

15:58.350 --> 16:03.760
- Right, but all signs
point to it being in Arkansas.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.530
- Yeah.
- That's about all we know.

16:05.530 --> 16:08.830
Hopefully you could help us
piece this puzzle together.

16:08.830 --> 16:10.630
Here's the new stuff
that you got.

16:10.630 --> 16:12.700
Who's this?

16:12.700 --> 16:13.970
- That's Milo.

16:13.970 --> 16:16.440
- Okay, so this was
who he said he was

16:16.440 --> 16:18.540
after you found out
he wasn't Lewis.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.440
- Yep.
- Okay and then what's this?

16:20.440 --> 16:24.840
- That's the Twitter of Blue.

16:24.850 --> 16:28.650
- So when he finally said,
"Okay, I'm actually Blue,"

16:28.650 --> 16:30.150
you looked up
his Twitter page?

16:30.150 --> 16:32.720
- I looked up the name Blue
and--

16:32.720 --> 16:34.720
- You found this.
- It was already following me.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.290
- It was already following you.
- And, yeah, so...

16:37.290 --> 16:39.860
- Weird. You didn't
image search this picture?

16:39.860 --> 16:40.930
- No.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.300
- Do you know
how to image search?

16:42.300 --> 16:43.700
- No, I don't.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.060
- All right,
let's bring the picture in.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.230
- Is his picture gonna come up?
- Easy.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.070
- Ah.
- No, nothing.

16:50.070 --> 16:53.270
- Nothing.
All right, well look.

16:53.270 --> 16:55.510
There's a Rihana
that you sent the money to,

16:55.510 --> 16:58.210
and then there's Blue mob.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.650
I have a feeling one or both
of these people

17:00.650 --> 17:02.280
is somehow involved.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.790
This person has done
a really good job of...

17:05.790 --> 17:08.119
- Covering up.
- Covering up, confusing,

17:08.119 --> 17:09.359
tricking, lying.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.760
I don't get the feeling

17:10.760 --> 17:12.690
that we're gonna
figure it all out online.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.660
- Right.
- We gotta just hope

17:14.660 --> 17:17.130
that we can contact
whoever it is

17:17.130 --> 17:18.599
with their phone number.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.530
Let them know that
you want to meet

17:21.540 --> 17:23.099
and that if
they care about you

17:23.099 --> 17:25.040
and if everything
they say is true,

17:25.040 --> 17:27.170
then there should be
no reason not to.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.840
That's what we do.
We can make it happen.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.880
- Yeah.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.350
- All right, I'll go call.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.450
- Okay.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.250
- See what I can figure out.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.580
- Good luck.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.890
[line ringing]

17:44.660 --> 17:46.890
- Hi, uh, is this Blue?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.730
I'm a friend of Yasmine,

17:49.730 --> 17:51.660
and, well,
she wanted me to call you,

17:51.670 --> 17:54.070
because we're
trying to figure out

17:54.070 --> 17:56.070
if there's a way
we can meet up with you.

17:56.070 --> 17:59.840
I don't know if you've ever
seen the show "Catfish,"

17:59.840 --> 18:04.280
but I'm the guy on that show.

18:04.280 --> 18:08.450
We're here in Oklahoma
with Yasmine.

18:08.450 --> 18:11.180
She really cares about you.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.320
I mean, how do you feel
about Yasmine?

18:17.530 --> 18:20.360
Where do you--
Where do you live?

18:20.360 --> 18:25.300
Okay, cool, so you live in
Little Rock, Arkansas.

18:25.300 --> 18:29.600
And is meeting up with her
something that you wanted to do?

18:38.880 --> 18:41.910
- How do you feel about Yasmine?

18:44.320 --> 18:47.120
Is meeting up with her
something that you wanted to do?

18:53.900 --> 18:57.200
You don't want to meet her
or you're afraid to meet her?

19:00.340 --> 19:03.870
Sure, if that's how you feel.

19:03.870 --> 19:06.670
Right, you're nervous.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.710
What are you scared of?
What are you afraid of?

19:15.120 --> 19:17.180
All right, well look,
you've already lied to her

19:17.190 --> 19:20.890
way more times than
most people would be willing

19:20.890 --> 19:23.090
to put up with,
and she still cares for you

19:23.090 --> 19:24.690
and still wants
to be your friend,

19:24.690 --> 19:27.130
so I feel like if you did
finally meet

19:27.130 --> 19:28.630
and tell her the truth,

19:28.630 --> 19:32.200
you'd have a very good chance
of keeping her in your life,

19:32.200 --> 19:36.500
because I don't think
she's really willing

19:36.500 --> 19:39.770
to keep things going
how they are if she doesn't--

19:39.770 --> 19:41.240
[line beeps]

19:41.240 --> 19:43.540
Oh.
He hung up.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.250
- Okay, here we go.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.190
Please come with good news.

19:52.190 --> 19:55.490
- Well, he does love you
and care about you,

19:55.490 --> 19:57.060
but then I sort of inquired
a little bit more,

19:57.060 --> 19:58.420
"Okay, well, where are you?"

19:58.430 --> 20:02.130
"Little Rock,"
which is what we suspected.

20:02.130 --> 20:03.930
And then I was like, "Well,
if we come to Little Rock,

20:03.930 --> 20:05.430
will you meet up with us?"

20:05.430 --> 20:07.900
And I think the idea
of us actually coming there

20:07.900 --> 20:10.770
must have scared him,
'cause then he said,

20:10.770 --> 20:13.470
"Well, I don't think
I can do that."

20:13.470 --> 20:15.070
And so I started to explain,

20:15.080 --> 20:17.480
"Well, I think
it's very apparent

20:17.480 --> 20:21.380
"that you've been forgiving
and open-minded now

20:21.380 --> 20:24.750
time after time, and if
anyone's not gonna judge you..."

20:24.750 --> 20:26.590
- It's definitely
not gonna be Yasmine.

20:26.590 --> 20:29.060
- It's not Yasmine,
and eventually he hung up.

20:39.330 --> 20:42.240
- They love me,
but they don't want to see me.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.600
- I don't think that
he wants to lose you.

20:44.610 --> 20:48.270
- He's probably afraid
of being rejected by you.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.440
- So we can drive
to Little Rock.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.980
It's not that far.

20:54.980 --> 20:59.090
- I feel like I should just
take a stand for myself now.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.890
'Cause right now I feel like--
- Absolutely! There you go.

21:01.890 --> 21:04.120
- We'll just plan on going
tomorrow morning.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.090
both: Okay.

21:05.090 --> 21:07.190
- Let's do it.
Road trip.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.790
- Road trip.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.770
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

21:12.770 --> 21:14.800
- All right, let's do this.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.440
Hey!
- Sandra!

21:18.440 --> 21:21.140
- And she's ready for you.
- Come out into the light.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.710
[laughter]
Wow, look at her.

21:23.710 --> 21:26.310
- I'm here with you
no matter what, okay?

21:26.310 --> 21:27.410
Bye. God bless you.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.980
I love you, sweetheart.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.990
- Let's do it.
- Arkansas, here we come.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.960
How do you feel?
- I'm super nervous.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.460
- Are you?
- Yeah.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.960
Especially 'cause
he hasn't even replied.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.430
- You texted Blue.
- Yeah.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.960
- And they have not responded.
- At all.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.770
- Maybe we should let him know
we're en route.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.870
- "We're on our way
to Arkansas now.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.940
"I know you're
probably nervous.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.870
"Trust me,
I'm nervous too,

21:52.870 --> 21:55.070
but this is probably
for the best."

21:55.080 --> 21:56.940
Maybe do--
maybe you just like,

21:56.940 --> 21:58.880
"Will you meet with us today?"

21:58.880 --> 22:04.080
- "Will you please
meet with us today?"

22:04.090 --> 22:08.150
- You know what, you know,
going to meet him

22:08.160 --> 22:10.690
means potentially losing him.
- Yeah.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.460
I think that's what
scares me the most.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.360
As much as I want answers
and I want the truth,

22:16.360 --> 22:19.370
it scares me to actually
lose this person.

22:19.370 --> 22:22.600
[phone vibrates]
- You got a text!

22:22.600 --> 22:25.200
What does it say?
- "Meet me here.

22:25.210 --> 22:29.580
[bleep] Road,
Little Rock, Arkansas."

22:29.580 --> 22:30.840
- Wow.
- We're in.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.980
- I'm amazed we got an address.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.480
That's a big deal.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.880
- It's a big deal
for both of you guys.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.530
- Little Rock...

22:47.530 --> 22:50.000
both: 44 miles.

22:57.670 --> 23:00.610
- We are almost there.

23:00.610 --> 23:03.640
<i> [tense music]</i>

23:06.980 --> 23:08.580
- We're here.

23:08.580 --> 23:10.850
- This is it.

23:13.620 --> 23:16.620
See how this goes.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
- A lot of doors.

23:26.500 --> 23:30.570
That whole side door thing.

23:35.910 --> 23:38.110
Don't see anyone over there.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.210
Let's try the front.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.680
- Okay.

23:52.030 --> 23:55.330
It's locked.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.700
- This is creepy.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.740
- Do you hear anything?

24:04.740 --> 24:07.640
- Maybe, like, the side door.

24:12.010 --> 24:14.480
- This is all so weird.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.220
- Hello?

24:37.410 --> 24:38.870
Hello?

24:41.810 --> 24:42.940
- Hello?

24:42.940 --> 24:45.940
<i> [tense music]</i>

24:45.950 --> 24:53.390
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

24:53.390 --> 24:54.650
Hello?

24:54.660 --> 24:55.750
Hi.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:57.220 --> 25:00.030
What's up?
- What's up?

25:02.260 --> 25:03.560
- I'm Nev.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.300
- Blue.
- Blue?

25:05.300 --> 25:06.230
Okay.

25:06.230 --> 25:08.000
- Is he talking to someone?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.530
- Yeah.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.170
- You kept us waiting there
for a while.

25:11.170 --> 25:12.570
- I got nervous.

25:12.570 --> 25:15.110
- Are you all right?

25:15.110 --> 25:16.410
You ready to do this?

25:16.410 --> 25:20.350
'Cause we came a long way.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.480
- I'm ready.

25:28.090 --> 25:31.220
- Okay, this is Blue.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.190
<i> [tense music]</i>

25:34.190 --> 25:38.060
This is Yasmine.
And this is Max.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.370
- So...

25:40.370 --> 25:44.070
what's your actual name?

25:44.070 --> 25:45.640
- Keerah.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.340
- Keerah?

25:48.340 --> 25:52.540
How do you identify yourself
in terms of your gender?

25:52.550 --> 25:55.150
- A female.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.620
Look, I did not do this
to hurt you.

26:01.620 --> 26:05.890
I love you, I do.

26:05.890 --> 26:07.330
- If you loved me,

26:07.330 --> 26:09.230
you would have been honest
when I told you,

26:09.230 --> 26:11.730
"If you're lying again,
I'm never gonna have

26:11.730 --> 26:14.970
anything to do with you."

26:14.970 --> 26:18.640
If you loved me, you wouldn't
have continued lying to me.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.340
If you loved me,

26:20.340 --> 26:23.740
you would have told me
you weren't even a guy.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.150
- You know, the pictures,
that wasn't me.

26:30.150 --> 26:33.390
But my life,
all of that was real.

26:33.390 --> 26:35.490
My personality,
all of that was real.

26:35.490 --> 26:38.690
I can't fake none of that.

26:38.690 --> 26:41.630
- Was the car accident real?
- Yeah.

26:41.630 --> 26:43.330
- Your cousin got into
a car accident?

26:43.330 --> 26:46.100
- Mm-hmm.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.770
- And how is Rihana?
Is that a friend?

26:47.770 --> 26:50.340
- Yeah.
- What's the story?

26:50.340 --> 26:53.440
How did it start?
How did the Lewis account start?

26:53.440 --> 26:57.840
- I started it for
a Twitter promotion group,

26:57.850 --> 27:01.010
<i> to getting more retweets</i>
<i> and followers and stuff.</i>

27:01.010 --> 27:02.950
<i> So I made it as Lewis.</i>

27:02.950 --> 27:06.490
<i> With him on Twitter,</i>
<i> I was getting more followers.</i>

27:06.490 --> 27:09.520
- Why not reach out to her
as yourself?

27:09.520 --> 27:11.620
- 'Cause at the moment,
you know, I didn't--

27:11.630 --> 27:15.530
I didn't know whether
she liked girls or not.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.260
<i> So, you know, I didn't want</i>
<i> to make her feel</i>

27:17.260 --> 27:18.530
<i> all uncomfortable, you know,</i>

27:18.530 --> 27:21.270
just flirting with her
and stuff.

27:21.270 --> 27:22.830
I'm sorry.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.570
- If you were so sorry,
why would you continue it?

27:29.380 --> 27:30.940
- Insecurities.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.780
- Insecurity about what?

27:33.780 --> 27:35.580
- Myself, my looks.

27:37.820 --> 27:41.850
- Do you know how many times
I sat up and cried to you?

27:41.860 --> 27:43.520
Told you my deepest secrets.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.290
Called into work
because you said,

27:45.290 --> 27:46.530
"Oh, babe,
I'm having a hard day.

27:46.530 --> 27:47.860
"I don't want you to go to work.

27:47.860 --> 27:50.760
I want you to give me
all of your attention."

27:50.760 --> 27:52.560
- And I appreciate that.

27:52.570 --> 27:56.570
- You told me to get
"Lewis" tatted on me.

27:56.570 --> 27:58.840
Insecurities doesn't tell you
to tell someone

27:58.840 --> 28:03.710
to tattoo a name that's
not even yours on their body.

28:03.710 --> 28:05.940
- You ever been caught up
in the moment?

28:07.480 --> 28:09.550
- I just don't understand
how you can blatantly

28:09.550 --> 28:11.220
tell me to do things like that

28:11.220 --> 28:12.580
and laugh about it
like it's nothing.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.250
- Who was laughing?

28:14.250 --> 28:15.850
When was I ever
laughing about it?

28:15.860 --> 28:17.860
- Like it's nothing. You were
just caught up in the moment,

28:17.860 --> 28:18.960
like it's nothing.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.760
- I never thought
this was funny,

28:20.760 --> 28:22.560
and I damn sure don't think
it's a [bleep] joke.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.630
See, that's what
you fail to realize.

28:24.630 --> 28:27.800
You don't get this [bleep]
coming through your head.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.040
You don't, you believe what
the [bleep] you want to believe.

28:31.040 --> 28:35.070
- What if she had tattooed
Lewis on her arm or something?

28:35.080 --> 28:39.240
- I mean, if she did, you know,
she coulda got it covered up.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.180
I mean, of course I wouldn't--

28:41.180 --> 28:42.350
I was just talking.

28:42.350 --> 28:44.580
- Exactly.
You were just talking.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.020
- About the mother[bleep] name,
goddamn!

28:49.520 --> 28:51.220
[bleep] this [bleep].

28:51.230 --> 28:53.290
Bitch, you don't wanna listen
to [bleep] I got to say, man.

28:53.290 --> 28:54.460
[bleep] y'all.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.000
[bleep].
[door opens, slams]

28:59.470 --> 29:01.030
- No, I'm sitting there.
You're on the couch.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.470
- Are you gonna shrink me?
You know, like therapy.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.600
- You should be the other way.
- Oh.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.670
- You shouldn't look at me.
Don't look at me.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.240
- Have you been
in therapy like that?

29:09.240 --> 29:11.010
- I've never had analysis,

29:11.010 --> 29:13.450
where the person in my position
asks questions,

29:13.450 --> 29:15.710
and the person in
your position just talks.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.420
'Cause it used to be
back in the day

29:17.420 --> 29:19.720
that people wouldn't talk
about certain things,

29:19.720 --> 29:23.090
but today you can't get people
to shut up about their problems.

29:23.090 --> 29:25.320
So it, like,
doesn't work anymore.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.430
[laughter]

29:31.600 --> 29:34.770
- Why don't we go
to the car for a second?

29:48.550 --> 29:50.980
- Hey, Blue?

29:50.980 --> 29:53.320
- [sobbing]

29:53.320 --> 29:56.020
- Hey.
It's just me.

29:56.020 --> 29:58.120
You all right?

30:04.060 --> 30:06.900
- I don't know how to prove
that I am sorry.

30:06.900 --> 30:11.940
- No one's questioning that
you have feelings for Yasmine,

30:11.940 --> 30:16.440
but you've gotta understand
that she's gonna be upset.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.710
- It hurts so bad.

30:18.710 --> 30:22.610
Like, I feel so stupid.

30:22.620 --> 30:26.350
Like, how could I
have not known?

30:26.350 --> 30:29.750
- She can sound like a guy.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.620
So I can kind of understand it.

30:32.630 --> 30:36.190
She still has a hold on you,
you know?

30:36.200 --> 30:38.660
I can see it.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.000
- You made this bed.

30:45.010 --> 30:48.410
- Yeah.
- Now you gotta sleep in it

30:48.410 --> 30:49.940
for at least today.

30:49.940 --> 30:52.410
So if you really want
to show her

30:52.410 --> 30:53.810
that she matters to you now,

30:53.810 --> 30:56.510
now is when
she needs you most.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.850
It's gonna be
a little different,

30:57.850 --> 30:59.950
but show her you,
show her the person

30:59.950 --> 31:01.690
that she sits on the phone with
for hours.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.420
Show her the person
that helps her out

31:03.420 --> 31:05.860
when she's sad and depressed
and makes her feel better.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.160
Let me go talk to her.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.540
How are you doing?

31:21.540 --> 31:23.680
- Hurt.
- Yeah.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.210
She was also very emotional,

31:25.210 --> 31:27.910
even though she wasn't
showing it out here.

31:27.910 --> 31:30.120
- And that's what, like,
made me the most mad.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.280
Like, you supposedly
care about me.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.520
And how are you just standing
here like it's nothing?

31:35.520 --> 31:38.190
- Well, it isn't nothing,
and she was very upset.

31:38.190 --> 31:41.290
So if you want
to say something more

31:41.290 --> 31:44.130
or just to let her
say something now,

31:44.130 --> 31:48.700
she came outside
to try again.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.640
- No.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.440
- But it's totally up to you.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.210
- No.

31:56.210 --> 31:58.980
I'm done.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.180
I just want my grandma.

32:03.180 --> 32:06.320
<i> [gentle music]</i>

32:06.320 --> 32:08.650
I want to go back home.

32:08.660 --> 32:16.830
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

32:16.830 --> 32:19.830
- All right, so why don't I
tell her that.

32:19.830 --> 32:22.170
- I'll step out.

32:28.580 --> 32:33.910
I think it's probably best
to let her absorb all this,

32:33.910 --> 32:36.710
and then maybe try again
tomorrow.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.150
- All right.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.360
- Okay.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.100
- Do you want to call
your grandma?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.300
- Let's see if she answers.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.570
[line ringing]

32:59.570 --> 33:02.470
So I met the person.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.840
It was a girl.

33:04.850 --> 33:07.950
She just had, like,
that "I don't care" attitude,

33:07.950 --> 33:10.620
you know, about, like,
anything that I said.

33:10.620 --> 33:11.880
I kinda yelled at her.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.490
Like, "Why would you do this?

33:13.490 --> 33:14.750
Why are you so careless
about this?"

33:14.750 --> 33:16.890
And she stormed off.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.490
- Hey, Sandra, we're gonna
stay here tonight,

33:22.500 --> 33:26.600
and then, you know,
depending on how Yasmine feels,

33:26.600 --> 33:31.340
maybe try and just sit down and
talk to Keerah again tomorrow.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.270
I think she does still
owe her, you know,

33:34.270 --> 33:36.980
an apology and an explanation
for a lot of this.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.140
So we're gonna see
how that goes.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.780
- I love you, too.

33:43.780 --> 33:47.420
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

33:51.060 --> 33:52.560
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I love you, too.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.530
- Yasmine.
- Hey.

33:54.630 --> 33:58.330
- How you doing today?
- All right, I guess.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.030
- So do you want
to talk to her?

34:00.130 --> 34:02.200
- I just feel like
if I end up talking to her,

34:02.300 --> 34:04.570
it's always like
I get guilt-tripped

34:04.670 --> 34:07.270
into forgiving her
every time when I tell her like,

34:07.370 --> 34:08.940
"Oh, I'm gonna leave.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.510
"I don't want to deal
with this anymore.

34:10.610 --> 34:11.610
I'm tired of this."

34:11.710 --> 34:13.010
She's like,
"Well, if you leave,

34:13.110 --> 34:14.280
"I'm not gonna have anybody.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.280
If you leave,
who am I gonna have?"

34:16.380 --> 34:21.320
- Us being there
to not let her do that

34:21.420 --> 34:24.090
is definitely something
we can do.

34:25.530 --> 34:27.929
- I think the right move
is to go over there,

34:28.030 --> 34:29.130
to hear her out.

34:29.230 --> 34:30.960
She obviously
has something to say.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.360
We'll be there to step in

34:32.469 --> 34:34.670
if she starts
trying to manipulate you

34:34.770 --> 34:36.130
and guilt-trip you.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.670
But I think that the goal
is to come out of today

34:38.770 --> 34:42.210
feeling that at least you've
closed this chapter.

34:42.310 --> 34:43.239
- Yeah.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.210
I should at least hear

34:45.310 --> 34:48.650
the last thing
she has to say.

34:48.750 --> 34:51.620
<i> [gentle music]</i>

34:51.719 --> 34:58.620

34:58.730 --> 35:01.160
- Here we are.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.230
If you do what's best for you,

35:03.330 --> 35:05.960
that is also what's
gonna be best for her.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.500
- All right.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.470
<i> [tense music]</i>

35:10.570 --> 35:17.510
<i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:20.310 --> 35:22.010
- Hey.
Good morning.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.350
- Good morning.
- Nice to see you again.

35:25.450 --> 35:27.890
Thanks for having us back.

35:27.990 --> 35:29.350
- [indistinct]

35:29.460 --> 35:31.190
- Is there a place
maybe we could sit down?

35:31.290 --> 35:32.790
- We can go in the back.
- The back, okay.

35:32.890 --> 35:36.030
Let's do it.

35:40.330 --> 35:43.430
- You have a chance to think
about yesterday

35:43.540 --> 35:45.370
and everything?

35:45.470 --> 35:47.940
- Yep.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.010
I do want to apologize

35:50.110 --> 35:53.110
for walking out on you
like that.

35:53.210 --> 35:56.110
I just got frustrated.

35:56.220 --> 36:00.250
I never meant to hurt you.

36:00.350 --> 36:03.450
And I know I did
cause a lot of pain.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.160
You know, those feelings
that I expressed to you

36:06.260 --> 36:08.690
every day about
how I actually feel,

36:08.800 --> 36:10.660
that's--that's real.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.260
That's not gonna change.

36:12.370 --> 36:13.800
bleep, I'm in love.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.370
I'm in love with you.

36:19.340 --> 36:21.670
- I'll always care about you

36:21.780 --> 36:23.610
and everything
you've done for me,

36:23.710 --> 36:27.650
I'll always remember that,
and I'll never forget that,

36:27.750 --> 36:30.480
and I think no matter
what happens,

36:30.580 --> 36:33.350
I'll always have
some type of love for you,

36:33.450 --> 36:36.490
because you've helped me
through so much.

36:39.060 --> 36:43.590
But, like, it's best...

36:43.700 --> 36:46.030
to let go.

36:46.130 --> 36:50.540
Not only so I can find myself

36:50.640 --> 36:51.570
and better myself,

36:51.670 --> 36:55.140
but so you can also
do the same.

37:01.150 --> 37:03.680
- Why don't we step out,

37:03.780 --> 37:06.550
and you guys can kinda
say good-bye.

37:06.650 --> 37:09.150
- All right.

37:16.500 --> 37:21.670
- I want you to know that
I'll always cherish everything

37:21.770 --> 37:24.400
that you did do for me.

37:24.500 --> 37:27.670
That's something
I'll never forget.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.140
I'm gonna always care for you.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.450
It's just...

37:37.580 --> 37:39.550
- I got you.

37:40.990 --> 37:42.690
I get where you're
coming from.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.860
- And I'm not saying that, like,
we'll never be friends again.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.090
We've gone through so much.

37:48.190 --> 37:50.090
- A lot.
- A lot.

37:50.200 --> 37:53.160
I refuse to let this end

37:53.270 --> 37:56.600
on a bad note.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.870
We'll just call it
a good-bye for now?

37:59.970 --> 38:01.940
- Yeah.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.380
All right.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.280
Well...

38:06.380 --> 38:09.350
can I have a hug?

38:09.450 --> 38:10.720
- Yes.

38:13.650 --> 38:17.890
-<i> ¶ There's a drop</i>

You're not getting a kiss.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.680
Yeah.

really do have a connection.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.480
- How do you feel
about it all?

39:20.590 --> 39:22.150
- It's gonna be hard
to let go,

39:22.260 --> 39:25.060
but right now I feel like
the both of us

39:25.160 --> 39:29.060
kinda just need
to find ourselves.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.560
Now I can start
finding me again.
