WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.040
So what kind of thing
likes virgins and gold?

00:05.205 --> 00:07.048
- Dragons.
- Dragons, dude.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.346
Oh, no.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.646
I just think it's better
if you took it easy,

00:12.713 --> 00:14.351
you know, and didn't
act like you were...

00:14.414 --> 00:15.484
Possessed by an angel?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.187
I believe
you knew Sheriff Mills.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.662
That was not my son.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.719
- You're right.
- No!

00:19.720 --> 00:21.757
How do we put him down?

00:21.855 --> 00:22.855
What are we drinking?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.563
You have less
than one minute

00:24.591 --> 00:28.596
before a very dear
friend of yours snuffs it.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.164
Call it off, Crowley.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.607
I saw you break down, Crowley.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.865
When I was trying to cure you,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.107
I know a part of you was
human again, maybe still is.

00:35.168 --> 00:36.613
Blah, blah, boo-hoo.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.899
Nighty-night, Slim.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.066
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.971
- You okay'?
- Yeah. Uh...

02:49.469 --> 02:51.346
Yeah.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.850
Just, uh...

02:52.906 --> 02:54.852
thought I'd rest
my head for a second.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.378
How's Kevin? He, uh...

02:58.512 --> 02:59.752
He find anything?

02:59.813 --> 03:02.191
- Uh, jack.
- Hmm.

03:02.315 --> 03:03.817
Going on about
four days, no sleep,

03:03.884 --> 03:04.885
he looks worse than you.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.729
What about Crowley?

03:10.490 --> 03:13.437
Do you think he might be
lying about the whole, uh...

03:13.493 --> 03:15.598
Metatron spell
being irreversible thing?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.937
What, Crowley, lie?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.872
I do know one thing.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.436
Next time that junkie's jonesing

03:22.536 --> 03:24.038
for a hit of blood,
we got leverage.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.042
Seriously, you want a pillow?

03:28.108 --> 03:29.108
No, I'm fine.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.110
You're sick.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.780
No, I'm not sick.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.882
It's just, uh...

03:33.947 --> 03:36.120
I feel like my battery
can't re-charge.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.793
Hello?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.600
Hey, Dean, Jody Mills.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.799
Sheriff Mills.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.399
Hang on, Sam's here, too.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.465
Hey, Jody.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.775
Hey, Sam.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.800
Uh...

03:54.868 --> 03:57.144
Got a bit of an oddball
to pitch your direction.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.806
Shoot.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.478
Small town I cover
outside of Sioux Falls,

04:01.541 --> 04:04.613
only crime to speak of being
the occasional cow-tipping.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.887
Then last week,
four people go missing.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.087
All right, so what makes you
think this is our kind of weird?

04:10.150 --> 04:12.426
I've got a witness
who says he saw someone

04:12.552 --> 04:15.396
lift an SUV
to nab a girl last night.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.506
Sheriff.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.509
Laying off
the blind dates, I hope.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.282
Yeah, you bite your tongue, boy.

04:38.678 --> 04:39.679
Hey.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.181
So.

04:42.182 --> 04:46.028
So the car was right over
there, ass-over-tea-kettle.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.156
Now normally, if somebody
would tell me that

04:48.188 --> 04:51.362
one guy lifted an SUV, I'd
tell him to take a flying leap.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.199
But after what I've seen...

04:53.293 --> 04:54.931
- Nothing's impossible.
- Uh-huh.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.032
And this matches up
with the other missing how?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.336
Well, four abductions,

04:58.365 --> 05:00.311
strong evidence left
at every scene, literally.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.036
So first vic was a pastor?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.135
Yeah.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.206
Door of his study
was punched in.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.304
And then, the next two...

05:06.506 --> 05:07.506
Engaged couple.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.518
Locked bedroom window
was ripped open.

05:09.609 --> 05:12.283
And then we have our waitress here
with the topsy-turvy ride.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.057
Any other connection among them?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.115
Yeah.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.393
They were all members
of Good Faith church here.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.057
My church group
back in Sioux Falls

05:22.155 --> 05:23.190
was in a tizzy over it.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.692
- Hmm.
- What?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.999
Didn't peg you for churchy.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.073
Yeah, you know,

05:31.131 --> 05:33.805
choking on the ladies' room floor
because of witchcraft

05:33.967 --> 05:35.708
kind of makes a higher power
seem relevant.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.681
Jody, you sure you, uh...

05:37.737 --> 05:39.580
ready to jump back in the fray?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.576
This wackadoo stuff
keeps coming.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.553
More I know,
better armed I'll be.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.583
Okay, so we have,

05:47.681 --> 05:50.093
missing church folk
and super strength.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.821
Maybe angels harvesting vessels?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.421
Could be
a Buddy Boyle-type thing.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.727
Wha... Angels?
You're joking.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.325
Don't get your pants on fire.
They suck.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.597
You said there was a witness.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.001
Yeah, well,

06:01.061 --> 06:02.267
more or less.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.907
Okay, Slim, my friends here,

06:05.932 --> 06:07.612
want to talk to you
about the missing girl.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.743
Honor.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.772
Her name was Honor.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.352
Nice girl.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.887
Always left me meatloaves.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.451
Slim, why don't you tell us
what you saw that night?

06:21.948 --> 06:24.622
Heard a big noise, got woke.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.789
And there's somebody over there,

06:26.887 --> 06:30.562
lifting a car up, like this.

06:31.591 --> 06:34.265
And did you ever see who it was?

06:34.294 --> 06:35.705
I was too far.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.376
But I saw a light go off.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.466
A white light?

06:39.532 --> 06:41.637
Blue.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.476
Blue like fire.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.777
But not.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.445
Then she was...

06:48.475 --> 06:49.749
She wasn't there.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.720
Could you think
of anything else?

06:53.914 --> 06:54.915
No.

06:56.216 --> 07:00.130
Okay, well, Slim,
thank you for your time.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.573
Okay, so no white light.

07:10.630 --> 07:11.904
No angel.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.308
Has anybody talked
to the victims' families?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.971
- It's next on my list.
- Okay.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.309
You said that they were
all part of the same church?

07:16.636 --> 07:17.273
Mm-hmm.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.283
Ready to get your worship on?

07:22.342 --> 07:25.084
I hope you
enjoyed the tour.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.354
Any questions before
we get you boys registered?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.587
Yeah, look...

07:30.650 --> 07:31.685
Miss Futchko...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.321
Oh, please.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.923
Bonnie will do just fine.

07:34.988 --> 07:35.988
Bonnie, okay.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.030
We love the church.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.435
We do.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.370
But...

07:42.462 --> 07:45.033
well, we've heard that a few
members have gone missing

07:45.098 --> 07:48.204
and to be honest,

07:48.301 --> 07:49.609
it kind of scares us.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.841
Let me assure you,

07:52.872 --> 07:54.442
with our increased security,

07:54.507 --> 07:56.714
Good Faith has never been safer.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.347
And those people
who have gone missing,

07:59.512 --> 08:01.822
well, they are front and center
in our prayers.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.959
What a relief.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.555
Now you must've been
close to them.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.067
Well, we do share
the A.P.U. bond.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.228
The A.P.U.?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.963
Our chastity group.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.836
"Abstinence Purifies Us."

08:15.996 --> 08:17.703
Oh.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.431
Wow, you mind if we...
We sit in on that,

08:19.499 --> 08:20.499
maybe see if ifs for us'?

08:20.533 --> 08:22.137
I'm afraid it's members only.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.479
I'm sorry, but it can
get pretty personal.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.142
Then count us in.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.753
Well...

08:33.813 --> 08:36.191
I'll be a squirrel in a skirt.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.769
I'll be back in a jiff
with the papers.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.269
A chastity group?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.168
Dean, listen, if all
the members were in A.P.U.,

08:48.228 --> 08:50.435
then maybe whatever
took them is stalking virgins.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.271
And that Slim guy said
he thought he saw a fire.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.685
So what are you
thinking, dragons?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.077
Mmm. Shh.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.772
Alrighty.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.613
You just sign there and
your purification can begin.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.516
Purity pledge?

09:05.578 --> 09:07.285
It's a commitment
to your virginity.

09:09.582 --> 09:12.927
I don't think we can
really un-ring that bell.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.056
You know what I mean.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.471
Oh.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.139
I see.

09:24.197 --> 09:28.942
Well, if you just ask for
God's forgiveness for your sins

09:28.968 --> 09:31.642
and make a new vow of chastity,

09:31.704 --> 09:33.547
well, then, you'll be born again

09:33.606 --> 09:35.108
as a virgin in His eyes.

09:35.141 --> 09:38.645
So you just hit
the virginity do-over button

09:38.711 --> 09:39.746
and all is good
with the man upstairs?

09:39.813 --> 09:42.726
It's not a button.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.762
And...

09:44.818 --> 09:46.593
this isn't just
a piece of paper.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.066
I mean, this
is your clean slate,

09:50.123 --> 09:52.626
your chance to be
a virgin until marriage.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.229
Well, you had me at clean slate.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.331
Let's do this.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.984
Congratulations,
Sam and Dean Winchester.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.351
You are both virgins.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.814
Ah.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.862
Please...

11:25.919 --> 11:27.330
stay away from me.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.661
Good afternoon, everyone.

11:33.826 --> 11:34.986
- I'm Suzy.
- Hi, Suzy.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.565
I thought we'd begin
with a silent prayer

11:37.597 --> 11:38.598
for our missing friends.

11:51.744 --> 11:52.950
Amen.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.389
Amen.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.690
Now does anyone have anything
that they would like to share?

11:57.750 --> 12:00.026
I wrote a new piece of verse.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.301
It's called, "Sex is a Racket,

12:04.357 --> 12:06.200
and God's Ball
is in Your Court."

12:06.259 --> 12:08.637
And we would love
to hear that, Tammy.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.071
Later.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.108
Why don't we hear
from our new friends?

12:15.134 --> 12:16.579
Sam.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.516
What brought you here
to reclaim your virginity?

12:22.041 --> 12:25.989
Well, I guess because
every woman I've...

12:26.079 --> 12:30.653
ever had relations with, uh...

12:30.750 --> 12:33.731
it hasn't ended well.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.667
He ain't lying.

12:36.823 --> 12:37.995
Thank you
for being here, Sam.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.003
Stay strong, stay pure.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.937
Stay strong, stay pure.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.442
And you, Dean?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.671
What set you on
the path away from sin?

12:49.936 --> 12:50.778
Uh...

12:50.903 --> 12:53.907
Hard to say, exactly, yeah.

12:53.973 --> 12:57.648
Sex has always felt,

12:57.677 --> 12:58.951
I don't know,

12:59.012 --> 13:03.256
good, you know.
I mean, really, really good.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.258
But, uh...

13:08.321 --> 13:10.028
sometimes it just
makes you feel bad.

13:10.123 --> 13:15.038
You know, you're drunk,
you shack up.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.971
Then it's the whole
morning thing, you know.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.976
Hey, that was fun.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.273
And then, adios.

13:21.334 --> 13:25.111
You know, always the adios.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.206
But, you know,
when you get down to it,

13:26.306 --> 13:27.341
what's the big deal, right'?

13:27.373 --> 13:30.354
I mean, sure, there's
the touching and the feeling,

13:30.376 --> 13:32.287
all of each other.

13:32.345 --> 13:36.851
My hands everywhere tracing
every inch of her body.

13:36.883 --> 13:40.194
The two of us moving together,

13:40.219 --> 13:45.293
pressing, pulling, grinding.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.304
And then, you hit
that sweet spot

13:47.360 --> 13:49.863
and everything just builds,

13:49.962 --> 13:53.409
builds, builds,
until it all just...

13:58.338 --> 14:00.511
Yeah, uh...

14:00.573 --> 14:03.850
But the whole thing
was just a little too...

14:03.910 --> 14:05.321
sticky.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.257
So, I got my V-card back.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.758
The end.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.351
Excuse me.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.526
So, uh...

14:16.589 --> 14:18.762
wee bit of an over-share, Dean?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.168
I was purifying.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.500
Hey, she look familiar to you?

14:26.899 --> 14:28.276
- Suzy?
- Yeah.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.370
Swear I know her from somewhere.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.413
Oh, good, Dean,
because that line never fails.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.507
Well, let's find out.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.111
Hey.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.388
- So?
- So?

14:41.514 --> 14:42.857
How did you like the meeting?

14:42.915 --> 14:45.418
Oh, I... I loved it.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.364
Yeah, you know, I couldn't help

14:48.454 --> 14:50.764
but think of those
who weren't here.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.295
Oh...

14:53.960 --> 14:55.735
Honor.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.536
She's my favorite.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.205
Would you excuse me?

15:09.442 --> 15:10.887
Her favorite?

15:11.310 --> 15:12.050
Ellen, how many times
do I have to tell you...

15:12.111 --> 15:14.955
She has no idea
what kind of girl Honor is.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.483
You don't say.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.755
Tammy, right?

15:17.817 --> 15:18.817
The poet?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.491
Tammy, why don't...

15:20.553 --> 15:23.056
Why don't you tell me
what kind of girl Honor is?

15:23.122 --> 15:24.658
Are you sure we don't
know each other?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
we've never met, Dean.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.070
Wait, you're new in town, right?

15:30.129 --> 15:31.335
Yeah, new to town,

15:31.431 --> 15:33.604
new to this whole
chastity thing.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.668
Well, I provide
individual counseling,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.305
if you ever need to talk.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.111
So everybody in the group,
they dish to you?

15:39.172 --> 15:40.173
They confide.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.843
Abstinence is...

15:41.941 --> 15:47.118
It's really rough without
support and education.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.181
Hey, you know what,

15:48.281 --> 15:52.320
I have some great books on
the vow that really helped me.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.796
I live close,
I'll just go grab them.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
With a...

15:55.154 --> 15:56.531
With a kidnapper on the loose?

15:56.622 --> 15:57.828
I'll be fine.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.336
Tell you what,
why don't I walk with you,

15:59.358 --> 16:00.701
just to be safe, okay?

16:00.760 --> 16:01.795
Just give me one second.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.943
And I bake real cookies
for the bake sale.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.636
Honor just brings Oreos.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.373
Oh, you know, excuse me.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.606
Guess who's taking
the teacher home?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.046
Research.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.348
You really think
you're gonna hit that?

16:17.376 --> 16:19.219
Dean, she's
the chastity counselor.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.814
Yeah, I know.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.052
What about you, any luck?

16:22.114 --> 16:23.354
You mean, am I actually working?

16:23.382 --> 16:24.582
As a matter of fact, yes, I am.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.057
All right, well,
good luck with that.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.463
Okay, lead the way.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.626
Okay.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.874
Hey.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.467
Sorry.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.532
So where were we?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.911
Honor is going to hell.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.642
Hey.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.645
How was church?

16:54.046 --> 16:55.366
Well, it turned
into confessional.

16:55.414 --> 16:58.054
Apparently, two of our vics,

16:58.084 --> 17:01.258
Honor and Pastor Fred,
did the dirty.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.994
Oh, well, they're
not the only ones.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.762
Barb Blanton,
our missing bride-to-be?

17:05.858 --> 17:06.893
Yeah?

17:06.925 --> 17:11.396
Her mom said she heard Barb and
her fiance in Barb's bedroom.

17:11.430 --> 17:12.932
Going at it'?

17:13.098 --> 17:16.705
Well, she said she heard
sex noises, then Barb crying,

17:16.769 --> 17:18.180
then Neil telling Barb
it didn't count,

17:18.237 --> 17:19.614
because it was under 30 seconds.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.011
And then, two hours later,

17:24.076 --> 17:27.114
she heard a smash and saw
a flash of light under the door.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.180
Blue light?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.528
You know, I'm thinking
whatever this thing is,

17:31.584 --> 17:33.291
it's not going after virgins.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.024
Even born again virgins.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.192
It's taking virgins who
break their chastity vow.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.403
So dragons are off the list.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.970
Dragons?

17:44.697 --> 17:45.698
Those are a thing?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.608
Yeah.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.907
Too many things are things.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.717
Make yourself comfortable.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.240
Not now, Kato.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.874
I can't stop thinking
about my friends.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.309
I'm so scared for them.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.439
Will you pray with me, Dean?

19:01.674 --> 19:02.982
Sure.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.729
This is Dean's
other-other cell,

19:19.792 --> 19:22.033
so you must know what to do.

19:22.061 --> 19:25.565
Dean.
Come on, call me.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.138
You know, for being
born-again today,

19:31.203 --> 19:32.705
you sure look like crap.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.919
Wait a second.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.922
Did you get...

19:41.013 --> 19:42.515
- Born again?
- Yeah.

19:42.581 --> 19:46.927
Oh, Sam, I don't make
promises I can't keep.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.365
I just...

19:51.424 --> 19:54.166
I enjoy church.

19:54.226 --> 19:58.538
I mean, after...
after Bobby,

19:59.765 --> 20:02.336
Crowley. Just...

20:03.102 --> 20:05.582
I needed something
that made sense to me.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.106
You know, comfort, I guess.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.808
Yeah, I guess we're
all looking for that.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.016
Except those that got it.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.187
Come on.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.091
You and Dean,

20:18.117 --> 20:19.757
that's something special,
don't you think?

20:42.041 --> 20:43.041
Okay.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.986
So why don't you
breeze through these

20:45.044 --> 20:47.490
and I'm going to head
to the little girls' room.

20:47.646 --> 20:48.646
Hmm. Yeah.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.837
Hi.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.503
Dean?

21:09.802 --> 21:12.408
Dean.
Hey, are you there?

21:12.571 --> 21:14.016
Hello?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.779
Dean.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.976
Dean.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.010
Sammy.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.011
Hey.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.514
What's going on?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.025
I found something big.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.082
Yeah, so did we.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.357
So get this, It's not a dragon.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.859
- Uh-huh. Uh... ooh.
- Dean.

21:27.987 --> 21:28.861
Copy that.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.963
Hey.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.970
Or should I say... hula'?

21:42.935 --> 21:44.278
Uh, why?

21:44.336 --> 21:47.545
No reason, no reason.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.142
Are you okay?

21:49.208 --> 21:50.208
Me?

21:50.209 --> 21:51.483
I'm great.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.544
Why?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.183
Uh, you seem,

21:54.213 --> 21:55.351
I don't know,

21:55.381 --> 21:56.382
nervous.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.893
Nervous? No.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.191
I'm not nervous.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.527
Carmelita.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.405
So you've seen my...

22:09.461 --> 22:10.872
work.

22:13.866 --> 22:14.906
Listen, I don't blame you,

22:14.967 --> 22:18.005
if you want to be assigned
a new counselor, I get it.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.812
No.
No, no, are you...

22:20.873 --> 22:22.910
Are you kidding me?
I mean, you're a...

22:23.008 --> 22:23.918
You're a freaking legend.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.422
No, I am not that girl anymore.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.981
I moved here, I changed my name.

22:29.048 --> 22:32.495
That girl was...
Was horrible.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.430
Listen, uh, Suzy.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.262
I've seen a lot of awful things,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.199
stuff of nightmares.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.169
Okay? But you...

22:42.394 --> 22:44.101
You're the good dreams.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.908
And nobody in Hartford knows?

22:49.935 --> 22:51.243
Yeah, what am I supposed to say?

22:51.270 --> 22:52.613
Oh, yeah, hey, I used
to be a porn star.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.706
Let's pray?

22:55.774 --> 22:58.448
Well, they do not
appreciate you.

23:00.279 --> 23:04.056
I mean, the things you can do.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.222
The scene with the tacos.

23:09.788 --> 23:10.788
Yeah.

23:10.789 --> 23:13.599
Made me want to join a Mariachi
band just to be near you.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.934
Well, you are now.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.810
I am, aren't I?

23:22.902 --> 23:28.580
You're not like the other
guys in town, are you?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.643
You're kind of a...

23:30.743 --> 23:32.484
A bad boy.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.251
I don't know.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.953
Why don't you ask me that
in Spanish?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.662
Si.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.178
Pastor Fred.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.453
Neil? Barb?

24:44.516 --> 24:46.359
What the...?

24:46.385 --> 24:47.830
What happened to him?

24:47.886 --> 24:49.729
What do you think?
He's starving to death.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.662
Just like we will,
if we don't get out of here.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.090
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

24:53.125 --> 24:54.661
I was so scared.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.001
We were scared.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.008
Where did he go?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.016
What's up?

25:47.079 --> 25:49.025
This thing is taking people
that break their vows, right?

25:49.081 --> 25:50.116
Yeah.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.456
Dean and Suzy,

25:51.550 --> 25:52.550
been over an hour.

25:52.584 --> 25:53.585
Right.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.930
I got to say,
I really miss that.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.201
I miss it already.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.610
Okay.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.846
What are you doing?

26:43.902 --> 26:45.745
I'm so thirsty.

26:47.172 --> 26:49.482
So thirsty.

26:49.508 --> 26:52.853
There has to be a way out.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.058
Dean, hey, come on.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.823
Dean.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.728
Where are we?

28:14.092 --> 28:15.093
Hell.

28:23.835 --> 28:24.835
Neighbors see anything'?

28:24.836 --> 28:25.871
Flash of blue.

28:26.838 --> 28:27.680
Huh.

28:27.739 --> 28:28.945
You sure Dean was here?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.041
Oh, yeah.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.352
And I think he crossed
someone off his bucket list.

28:36.281 --> 28:38.352
We tried.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.623
There's no escape.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.201
Are we gonna run out of air?

28:45.257 --> 28:46.361
I don't think so.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.803
Somebody wants us
to die nice and slow.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.806
And then, it's gonna take us.

28:50.862 --> 28:52.637
Just like it took Pastor Fred.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.801
What took him'?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.410
We couldn't see exactly,

28:56.468 --> 28:57.811
it was so bright.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.214
It was like it was on fire.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.718
Hey.

29:02.774 --> 29:03.912
Virgins?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.580
Fire?

29:05.644 --> 29:07.419
Sound familiar?

29:08.780 --> 29:11.056
"Vesta, Roman goddess
of the hearth."

29:11.116 --> 29:13.653
In ancient Rome, six virgins

29:13.785 --> 29:15.093
were dedicated
to this chick every year.

29:15.153 --> 29:18.100
Their main duty was
to tend Vesta's hearth.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.432
Wait, so fire is
connected to virginity?

29:20.492 --> 29:21.835
Yeah. The girls
had to be pure,

29:21.893 --> 29:24.100
because fire is
the symbol of purity.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.263
Huh.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.299
Okay, "As long
as Vesta's fire was kept lit,

29:27.332 --> 29:29.005
Rome received
a good harvest."

29:29.101 --> 29:32.310
"The virgins had to stay
celibate for 30 years.

29:32.337 --> 29:35.113
If they broke their vows,
they were buried alive."

29:36.675 --> 29:37.915
Son of a bitch.

29:42.814 --> 29:45.021
Dean.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.324
Maybe God wants us down here

29:47.352 --> 29:50.526
because of what we did.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.262
Trust me,
this is not God's work.

29:54.359 --> 29:55.359
Son of a...

29:56.595 --> 29:57.699
What's wrong?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.707
It took my phone.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.873
Luckily...

30:05.637 --> 30:07.116
I keep a spare.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.052
Come on, bars.

30:18.717 --> 30:23.393
Vesta was often enveloped
in a blue halo of light

30:23.455 --> 30:27.198
which she could control at will
to disorient, to maim...

30:27.326 --> 30:27.997
Oh.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.366
Or to kill.

30:29.394 --> 30:31.203
Okay, what about
some way to kill her,

30:31.229 --> 30:32.731
a weapon or something?

30:37.369 --> 30:38.369
Dean?

30:38.370 --> 30:39.576
Sam.
Sammy.

30:39.638 --> 30:40.708
- Dean.
- Hey.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.582
Hey, listen to me, now...

30:42.674 --> 30:43.982
Dean, wait.

30:44.042 --> 30:44.986
Say it again, I can't hear you.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.319
We...
Some guy with...

30:47.379 --> 30:48.414
Dean.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.183
Lost him.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.184
What?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.028
Listen, is there some
kind of train station,

30:55.087 --> 30:56.031
around here or something'?

30:56.088 --> 30:57.528
I could have sworn
I heard a whistle.

31:01.059 --> 31:04.700
Don't, Neil, please, don't.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.242
Don't what, Neil?

31:06.264 --> 31:07.766
Just mind your beeswax, pal.

31:11.503 --> 31:12.846
Hey, hey.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.247
Listen, we're all stuck
down here together,

31:14.272 --> 31:16.218
so you got something
to say, you say it.

31:16.274 --> 31:20.051
Okay, look, whatever
that fireball thing was,

31:20.112 --> 31:22.615
it's taking the weakest
and I am not gonna be next.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.126
So the way I see it,
her leg's busted anyway.

31:25.183 --> 31:26.628
We serve her up,
it could buy us some time.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.220
Screw you, Neil.

31:30.021 --> 31:31.021
Busted leg?

31:31.022 --> 31:32.365
Try a sprained ankle, okay?

31:32.424 --> 31:34.062
Nobody’s serving anybody up.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.629
We are under the gallows.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.139
All of us.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.971
Give it Honor.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.476
It might save
the rest of our necks,

31:41.533 --> 31:43.069
unless you have a better plan.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.081
Maybe I do.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.275
Maybe we'll give him you.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.875
Oh, wait, you don't
like that idea?

31:48.940 --> 31:51.147
Then shut up.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.888
Here we go, 8:00 PM train
out of Sioux Falls.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.828
Seventy-nine miles an hour.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.230
What's five miles
east of Hartford? Anything?

32:05.590 --> 32:06.762
Uh...

32:07.058 --> 32:08.503
Pasture, mostly.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.062
No, the old Wimmer farm.

32:11.663 --> 32:12.743
Wait, anything on a weapon?

32:14.065 --> 32:16.568
Oak, stained in virgin blood.

32:16.635 --> 32:17.807
Where are we
going to get a virgin?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.008
I'm a virgin.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.812
I think we need
the real McCoy here, Sam.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.816
You need what?

32:23.842 --> 32:25.685
- Your blood.
- Just a dab.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.688
But pagans use blood.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.814
Are You pagans?

32:28.847 --> 32:30.019
What? Pagan?

32:30.081 --> 32:31.321
No, look,
it's for a weapon that...

32:31.349 --> 32:33.920
You are in a house of God.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.521
Your psycho rituals
aren't going to fly here.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.531
Okay, we don't
have time for this.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.192
I don't have time
for devil-worshippers.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.701
I'm calling the cops.

32:40.959 --> 32:41.994
I am the cops.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.033
What the fudge, lady?

32:47.098 --> 32:48.372
Wipe your nose, dear.

33:05.550 --> 33:06.551
Jody.

33:40.218 --> 33:41.253
You broke, too, huh?

33:43.088 --> 33:45.432
Guess I'm not as strong
as I thought I was.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.020
God forgives.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.197
You told me that yourself.

34:19.357 --> 34:21.132
Told you.
It's back for one of us.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.136
What are you going to do now?

34:22.193 --> 34:24.195
- You should have listened...
- Shh!

34:24.295 --> 34:25.297
Shut up.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.299
Jody.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.435
Sam?

34:28.466 --> 34:30.103
Dean, we're here.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.443
We're going to get you out.

34:31.469 --> 34:32.607
Jody, I found it.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.411
Sammy? Jody-

34:39.143 --> 34:40.315
Hey, Dean, we're here.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.289
We're going to get you out.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.659
Sammy! Sammy!

34:48.719 --> 34:49.721
Sam.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.899
Now, now.

35:13.511 --> 35:15.354
Really?
This is how a goddess acts?

35:15.447 --> 35:17.154
What?

35:17.182 --> 35:20.857
I'm sort of new to this,
but, you know, Roman deity,

35:20.919 --> 35:22.489
burying people alive in a barn?

35:22.520 --> 35:23.999
Sort of pathetic,
don't you think?

35:25.156 --> 35:27.476
It only got pathetic when I
started having to do it myself.

35:31.162 --> 35:34.166
Because of that hippie
from Bethlehem.

35:34.199 --> 35:38.511
Before him, they practically
threw virgins at me.

35:38.536 --> 35:39.536
And now...

35:39.537 --> 35:41.881
They let your fire go out,
they forgot about you.

35:41.973 --> 35:45.477
Yeah, I know. Sucks to be
Lindsay Lohan, doesn't it?

35:49.447 --> 35:54.192
Actually, I figured if you
can't beat them, join them.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.326
That's right.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.166
I adapted.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.341
And now, I chew
on the cud of prayer.

36:05.397 --> 36:09.573
Heck, I even got a sweater set.

36:20.478 --> 36:21.752
Screwdriver, anybody?

36:27.986 --> 36:28.986
Hey.

36:30.088 --> 36:31.726
From the first aid kit.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.876
They used to beg
to stay pure for me

36:42.934 --> 36:47.383
and now I have to drag them,
kicking and screaming.

36:47.439 --> 36:51.387
And they're
not even real virgins.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.945
They're born-again.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.447
You want to talk about pathetic.

36:55.513 --> 36:56.513
Yeah.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.754
You're a real charity case.

36:57.782 --> 37:00.262
Oh, no, sweetheart

37:00.285 --> 37:01.457
This isn't charity.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.726
I take what I deserve.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.131
And when those trollops
are about to die,

37:11.229 --> 37:13.903
soaked in their juicy fear,

37:13.965 --> 37:16.878
I eat their livers.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.372
Because that's
the only pad of them

37:20.438 --> 37:23.578
still working to purify
the body that they've trashed.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.320
Now normally,
I like them weaker.

37:27.378 --> 37:30.484
But let's just call this
a hunter's exception, shall we?

37:30.548 --> 37:31.822
Sure.

37:33.618 --> 37:36.565
This is how a goddess acts.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.171
Okay, come on, come on.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.082
What is wrong with you'?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.113
What?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.457
Your liver,

38:04.516 --> 38:06.120
it's...
It's no good.

38:07.852 --> 38:13.530
Dear boy, you're all duct tape
and safety pins inside.

38:13.591 --> 38:15.093
How are you alive?

38:34.112 --> 38:35.955
What did I miss?

38:47.659 --> 38:48.899
- Heading out?
- Yeah.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.564
I'd tell you boys
to stay out of trouble,

38:50.662 --> 38:51.902
but what's the point?

38:54.299 --> 38:54.970
Ow.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.673
Thanks for bailing me out.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.078
Oh, what can I say'?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.205
I'm getting the hang of this.

39:00.238 --> 39:01.581
- Drive safe.
- Thanks.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.954
Don't get the door
for me or anything.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.498
What's up?

39:19.591 --> 39:21.730
What if there is
something wrong with me?

39:21.759 --> 39:25.206
Something really wrong?

39:26.898 --> 39:28.844
You just crapped out, man,
you need some rest.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.038
No, it's more than that.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.741
I mean, Vesta said I was
practically dead inside.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.613
Oh, and she's in
the circle of trust now?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.117
Why would she lie?

39:37.775 --> 39:39.755
It's probably the trials, okay?

39:39.777 --> 39:42.758
Probably some sort of a,
you know, after-effect.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.225
It's not like you're bouncing
back from the flu here.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.955
I mean, you were glowing
with freaking trial juice.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.792
I don't know.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.793
Well, what else would it be?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.765
Why does it have to
be something else?

39:51.789 --> 39:53.359
It's always something else.

39:53.424 --> 39:56.303
We're always scraping
to find some other explanation,

39:56.394 --> 39:58.271
when maybe it is just me.

39:58.296 --> 39:59.296
Oh, come on, Sam.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.867
I'm a mess, Dean, you know it.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.469
And sometimes, I feel like,

40:03.534 --> 40:06.447
maybe I'm never gonna
actually be all right.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.280
You will.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.154
All right, because whatever
it is, we'll figure it out.

40:13.878 --> 40:17.655
Or this is...
just the way I am.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.663
I can't...

40:24.756 --> 40:26.565
I can't let you put
this on yourself.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.574
Listen to me.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.678
It's not you, Sam.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.513
I wouldn't do that, Dean.

40:43.841 --> 40:45.013
He deserves to know.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.488
Your brother is not ready.

40:47.512 --> 40:48.684
If he ejects me,
he will not make it.

40:48.780 --> 40:49.780
Well, damn it, Zeke,

40:49.781 --> 40:50.816
how much longer we got
to keep playing this?

40:50.848 --> 40:52.191
Not much longer.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.354
I promise you that.

40:56.587 --> 40:57.759
What?

40:59.290 --> 40:59.927
What?

40:59.928 --> 41:01.870
What, what's not me?

41:04.862 --> 41:07.809
Nothing, I just...
I meant that...

41:09.667 --> 41:13.205
...if there is something wrong,
it's not your fault.

41:14.505 --> 41:16.507
We'll deal with it.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.649
But you got to have
a little faith, Sammy.
