ON TOP OF THE EGGS,

05:13.444 --> 05:14.745

05:14.745 --> 05:17.518
WOULD BE RIGHT, BECAUSE...

05:17.518 --> 05:19.350
YOU SEE WHAT I'M DOING?

05:22.753 --> 05:24.495

YOUR FOUNDATION IS SOLID.

14:37.908 --> 14:40.951
WHY?
I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS,
CRISTINA, NOT YOU.

14:40.951 --> 14:42.652

15:40.670 --> 15:43.343
No. No, no. No, no, no.
I-I-I can't do this.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.215
(Owen) DANNY, DANNY,
YOU CAN DO THIS.

15:45.215 --> 15:46.946
WE HAVE ONE CHANCE
TO BRING YOU BOTH UP.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.380
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE
TO AMPUTATE SUSANNAH'S LEG.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.983
Oh, no. No.

15:52.983 --> 15:54.424
Oh, God. Oh.

15:54.424 --> 15:58.388
(panting)

15:58.388 --> 16:00.560
(woman moans)
(woman) I NEED A C-SPINE!

16:00.560 --> 16:03.593

COME ON. WATCH YOUR BACK.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.365
YOU GUYS HEADED BACK?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.997
YEAH, WE ARE.

16:06.997 --> 16:11.001
(indistinct conversations)

16:11.001 --> 16:13.073
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A KID?

16:13.073 --> 16:15.575
(groaning)

16:15.575 --> 16:18.708
(Alex) HAS ANYBODY SEEN
A KID AROUND?

16:18.708 --> 16:20.750
(woman groans)

16:20.750 --> 16:22.752
(indistinct conversations)

16:22.752 --> 16:24.584
WHERE'D THEY PULL
THIS GUY FROM?

16:24.584 --> 16:27.757
(man) WE'LL NEED
IMMEDIATE TRANSPORT FOR HER.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.759
YEAH, GIVE ME JUST A MINUTE
HERE, DOCTOR.

16:29.759 --> 16:30.720
I JUST GOTTA STABILIZE HER.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.723
(indistinct conversations)

16:37.097 --> 16:39.529
I NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE!

16:39.529 --> 16:42.302
(pants)

16:47.337 --> 16:48.478
(indistinct conversations)

16:48.478 --> 16:50.710
(men speaking indistinctly)

16:50.710 --> 16:52.382
HE'S NOT BREATHING.

16:52.382 --> 16:54.013
GET AN AMBU BAG
AND SOME OXYGEN OVER HERE.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.485
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

16:55.485 --> 16:57.787
(indistinct conversations
continue)

17:00.120 --> 17:03.353
(monitor beeping erratically)

17:03.353 --> 17:05.525
(man) OH, JEEZ.
WHAT HAPPENED? NO.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.557
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I NEED HELP.

17:07.557 --> 17:09.099
I-I THINK MY PATIENT'S CODING.

17:09.099 --> 17:10.460
YOU THINK
YOUR PATIENT'S CODING?

17:10.460 --> 17:12.062
WHAT'S HIS RHYTHM?

17:12.062 --> 17:13.133
UH...

17:13.133 --> 17:14.534
S.V.T.?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.466
SINUS TACH?
OKAY, THERE SHOULDN'T BE
A QUESTION MARK

17:16.466 --> 17:18.308
AT THE END OF THAT SENTENCE.
I DON'T KNOW. I'M FREAKING OUT.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.270
IT'S MY FIRST DAY OF INTERNSHIP.
HOW COULD THIS BE HAPPENING?

17:20.270 --> 17:23.343
GO BACK TO YOUR PATIENT.
DOES HE HAVE A PULSE?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.574
HE HAS A PULSE.

17:24.574 --> 17:27.447
GOOD. NOW CHECK
FOR BREATH SOUNDS.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.580
(beeping continues)

17:30.580 --> 17:31.751
UH, I KINDA HEAR SOME,

17:31.751 --> 17:33.353
BUT MAYBE THE RIGHT
SOUNDS LESS?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.255
YOU GOTTA STOP
WITH THE QUESTIONS.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.087
IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE HE'S
BARELY BREATHING AT ALL NOW.

17:37.087 --> 17:39.259
(Meredith) MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.730
TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX. GRAB
THE BIGGEST NEEDLE YOU CAN FIND.

17:40.730 --> 17:42.132
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:42.132 --> 17:43.663
TENSION PNEUMO.
THIS GUY'S FREAKING OUT.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.496
STEP AWAY, GREY.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.398
(beeping continues)

17:48.398 --> 17:50.140
UH... 14-GUAGE?
16-GUAGE?

17:50.140 --> 17:52.302
(both) THE BIGGEST NEEDLE
YOU CAN FIND!

17:52.302 --> 17:54.104
(drawer opens and closes)

17:54.104 --> 17:57.577
(beeping continues)

17:59.509 --> 18:01.211
(air hisses)

18:01.211 --> 18:02.382
(beeping normalizes)

18:02.382 --> 18:04.384
OKAY.
GET THIS MAN A CHEST TUBE.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.485
AND NEXT TIME,
CALLYOURRESIDENT.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.517
I'M SORRY. I-I THOUGHT
THAT SHE WAS A RESIDENT.

18:07.517 --> 18:08.658
NO, SHE IS NOT A RESIDENT.

18:08.658 --> 18:11.461
SHE WAS FIRED
BY THIS HOSPITAL.

18:11.461 --> 18:13.463
HAD THIS MAN DIED
UNDER HER CARE,

18:13.463 --> 18:15.595
THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE SUED,
YOU WOULD BE SUED,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.227
HELL, MAYBE EVEN I
WOULD BE SUED.

18:17.227 --> 18:19.299
NOW GET THIS MAN A CHEST TUBE,
AND, GREY,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.601
GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.604
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:24.604 --> 18:26.276
(mutters)

18:26.276 --> 18:28.107
(bag hisses)

18:28.107 --> 18:30.240
PULSE IS NOT GOOD.
HIS BREATH SOUNDS ARE SHALLOW.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.142
HIS NAME'S NICKY HOFFMAN.

18:32.142 --> 18:35.245
(indistinct conversations)

18:35.245 --> 18:37.387
PULSE IS MINIMAL
ON THIS SIDE, TOO.

18:37.387 --> 18:40.320
COME ON, NICKY. I NEED YOU
TO DO BETTER THAN THIS.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.491
THREADY PULSES,

18:41.491 --> 18:43.453
MULTIPLE RIB FRACTURES
WITH DECREASED RESPIRATIONS--

18:43.453 --> 18:44.654
HIS BODY'S SHUTTING DOWN.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.226
COULD BE COMPARTMENT SYNDROME.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.528
THAT COULD BE WHY HIS
RADIAL PULSES ARE SO DECREASED.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.300
WE NEED TO DO
BILATERAL FASCIOTOMIES

18:50.300 --> 18:51.561
AND RELIEVE THE PRESSURE.

18:51.561 --> 18:53.403
DO WE HAVE A SCALPEL?

18:53.403 --> 18:54.804
(indistinct conversations
continue)

18:54.804 --> 18:56.236
PUSH 5 OF MORPHINE.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.137
GOT IT.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.839
(grunts) OKAY.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.571
(squirts)

19:01.571 --> 19:03.173
(squirt)

19:03.173 --> 19:04.574
ALL RIGHT.

19:04.574 --> 19:06.145
OKAY,
YOU DO THE FASCIOTOMIES.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.877
YOU'RE THE FIFTH YEAR.

19:09.679 --> 19:11.681
(Owen) ALL RIGHT.

19:11.681 --> 19:14.784
(helicopter blades whirring)

19:14.784 --> 19:16.586
(indistinct conversations
continue)

19:16.586 --> 19:17.627
(whispers) OKAY.

19:17.627 --> 19:19.429
OKAY, HIS PULSE
IS STRONGER NOW.

19:19.429 --> 19:21.331
GOOD. DO THE OTHER ONE.

19:21.331 --> 19:23.233
SPONGE.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.534
HERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.

19:24.534 --> 19:26.636
(packaging crinkles)

19:26.636 --> 19:29.839
(sirens wailing)

19:29.839 --> 19:33.503
(indistinct conversations
continue)

19:34.944 --> 19:36.346
(moans)

19:36.346 --> 19:38.177
NICE JOB.
YOU GOT THIS?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.679
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.551
HEY.

19:41.551 --> 19:42.952
HEY, NICKY. I'M ALEX.

19:42.952 --> 19:44.654
I'M A DOCTOR.

19:44.654 --> 19:46.686
YOU HAD A PRETTY BAD ACCIDENT.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.218
(man shouts indistinctly)

19:48.218 --> 19:49.619
(sirens wail)

19:49.619 --> 19:51.691
(indistinct conversations)

19:51.691 --> 19:53.192
WE NEED A GUNTHER.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.924
DR. BAILEY, IT'S THE FIRST DAY
OF FIFTH YEAR. I--

19:54.924 --> 19:56.296
AND THEY'RE
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.697
WE NEED A GUNTHER.
(elevator bell dings)

19:57.697 --> 19:58.768
I'VE GOT
MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS.

19:58.768 --> 20:01.200
I'M TRYING TO FIND A NEW SPOT
FOR MEREDITH GREY.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.433
YOU KNOW, I HEARD THEY HAVE
A NEW RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP

20:03.433 --> 20:04.704
AT MASS GEN.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.876
I THOUGHT A RECOMMENDATION
FROM YOU MIGHT--

20:06.876 --> 20:08.578
YOU WANT ME
TO WRITE A RECOMMENDATION

20:08.578 --> 20:09.679
FOR MEREDITH GREY?

20:09.679 --> 20:11.781
BY THE END OF THE DAY
WOULD BE FINE.

20:11.781 --> 20:13.743
"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,

20:13.743 --> 20:15.945
"MEREDITH GREY
IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE

20:15.945 --> 20:17.647
"OF THE KIND OF RESIDENT

20:17.647 --> 20:19.649
"YOU ABSOLUTELY
SHOULDNOTHIRE.

20:19.649 --> 20:22.692
"SHE UNDERMINES GROUNDBREAKING
CLINICAL TRIALS,

20:22.692 --> 20:25.625
"SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT
FOR RULES, AUTHORITY,

20:25.625 --> 20:26.956
"OR, AS IT TURNS OUT,

20:26.956 --> 20:29.329
"THE OATH THAT SHE TOOK
WHEN SHE BECAME A DOCTOR.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.732
"SHE WILL MOST LIKELY
TARNISH THE REPUTATION OF YOU,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.664
"YOUR DOCTORS,
AND YOUR HOSPITAL.

20:34.664 --> 20:38.007
SINCERELY,
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY."

20:38.007 --> 20:41.441
MEREDITH GREY IS THE REASON
WE NEED A GUNTHER.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.643
(elevator bell dings)

20:43.643 --> 20:46.245
(indistinct conversations)

20:46.245 --> 20:47.747
JERRY HOFFMAN.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.321
C.T. SHOWED A TRAUMATIC
SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE.

20:51.321 --> 20:52.982
(beeping)
I CLEANED AND SPLINTED
HIS HUMERUS FRACTURE

20:52.982 --> 20:54.984
AND SUTURED
HIS FACIAL LACERATIONS.

20:54.984 --> 20:57.657
WELL, HE WON'T NEED SURGERY,
BUT LET'S DO A NEURO EXAM

20:57.657 --> 20:58.928
EVERY TWO HOURS
JUST TO MAKE SURE.

20:58.928 --> 21:00.790
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR HANDIWORK.

21:00.790 --> 21:03.262
OH, DEAR GOD.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.435
MY GRANDMOTHER COULD SEW UP
A STUFFED TURKEY...

21:05.435 --> 21:06.766
IT WAS...
BETTER THAN THIS.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.868
PRETTY, UH, JAGGED
IN THERE, SO--

21:08.868 --> 21:11.371
YOU EVER HEARD OF BURYING
YOUR STITCHES?
ALL RIGHT.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.742
SO I WILL FIX IT.

21:12.742 --> 21:14.874
(sighs) OH, JACKSON.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.476
THERE'S A NEW PATIENT
IN BED 3.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.777
KINDA BUSY, APRIL.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.909
YEAH, KINDA BUSY TURNING
THIS GUY INTO FRANKENSTEIN.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.911
GO. GO. MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

21:21.911 --> 21:23.753
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA FIX THIS.

21:23.753 --> 21:24.814
MM-HMM.

21:24.814 --> 21:26.816
(Derek sighs)

21:26.816 --> 21:28.688
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE HARD ON THE KID?

21:28.688 --> 21:29.859
HE'S A LIGHTWEIGHT.

21:29.859 --> 21:31.691
BE THANKFUL YOU HAVE MEREDITH.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.623
SHE WAS FIRED.

21:33.623 --> 21:36.366
(people speaking indistinctly)

21:36.366 --> 21:38.398
SHE OKAY?

21:38.398 --> 21:39.829
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

21:39.829 --> 21:42.532
I DON'T KNOW.
(moans)

21:42.532 --> 21:44.774
MR. HOFFMAN? DR. SHEPHERD.

21:44.774 --> 21:46.776
YOU'RE
AT SEATTLE GRACE HOSPITAL.

21:46.776 --> 21:49.709
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.
A SINKHOLE COLLAPSED.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.040
MY SON?

21:51.040 --> 21:52.712
NICKY'S ON HIS WAY IN.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.345
HE'S HAD SOME SEVERE INJURIES
THAT THEY NEED ME TO ASSESS,

21:55.345 --> 21:57.687
BUT I PROMISE YOU, I'M GONNA
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR SON.

21:57.687 --> 22:00.390
NICKY HOFFMAN,
SUSTAINED CRUSH INJURIES

22:00.390 --> 22:01.651
AND WAS VERY UNSTABLE
IN THE FIELD.

22:01.651 --> 22:02.652
ROBBINS IS HOLDING
A TRAUMA ROOM.

22:02.652 --> 22:03.653
WE CALLED SHEPHERD
FROM THE FIELD.

22:03.653 --> 22:04.824
WHICH ONE ARE THEY IN?

22:04.824 --> 22:05.925
UM...

22:05.925 --> 22:07.957
(sirens wailing)

22:07.957 --> 22:10.360
OH, GOD. I-I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.631
WELL, FIND OUT.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.103
WELL, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE BOARD. (sighs)

22:14.103 --> 22:17.837
PEOPLE, I NEED YOU TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE UPDATING THESE BOARDS.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.669
(indistinct conversations)

22:19.669 --> 22:22.712
APRIL, I NEED YOU
TO REASSIGN THESE CASES.

22:22.712 --> 22:24.844
UH, YANG, TAKE OVER
MEREDITH'S CASES.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.817
NO.
CRISTINA.

22:27.817 --> 22:30.019
I'M WITH ALTMAN, AND MEREDITH
SHOULD KEEP HER CASES.

22:30.019 --> 22:31.581
I AM YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT.

22:31.581 --> 22:32.882
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY.

22:32.882 --> 22:34.854
APRIL, IT'S FINE.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.356
I CAN WAIT. JUST SIGN THEM
WHEN YOU HAVE A MINUTE.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.389
(indistinct conversations
continue)

22:39.389 --> 22:40.890
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GIVE UP?

22:40.890 --> 22:42.592
I WAS FIRED.

22:42.592 --> 22:43.893
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

22:43.893 --> 22:45.535
YOU HAVE TO GO TALK
TO THE BOARD.

22:45.535 --> 22:47.366
THE BOARD FIRED ME.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.569
YANG.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.571
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:51.571 --> 22:53.573
(sirens wailing)

22:53.573 --> 22:55.144
I PRESENTED AS THIRSTY,

22:55.144 --> 22:57.947
SO... TREATED THE SYMPTOMS
WITH 8 OUNCES OF WATER.

22:57.947 --> 22:59.649
NOW THAT I'M FINISHED,

22:59.649 --> 23:02.151
I WILL PLACE THIS BOTTLE
IN THE RECYCLING BIN

23:02.151 --> 23:04.654
SO AS TO AVOID EXCESS STRAIN
ON SEATTLE'S LANDFILLS.

23:04.654 --> 23:05.955
(horn honks)

23:05.955 --> 23:08.758
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOU'RE A FUNNY GIRL.

23:08.758 --> 23:09.919
COME ON.

23:09.919 --> 23:11.661
WE HAVE PATIENTS.

23:11.661 --> 23:12.962
(bottle thuds)

23:12.962 --> 23:15.725
YOU NEED A PLAN.
COME UP WITH A PLAN.

23:15.725 --> 23:17.767
(indistinct conversations)

23:20.169 --> 23:22.872
(panting)

23:22.872 --> 23:25.905
(Callie) Okay, now pour on
that brown soap.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.907
(continues panting)

23:27.907 --> 23:30.840
(gravel clattering)

23:32.612 --> 23:35.114
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:35.114 --> 23:37.817
AND PICK UP
THE THIN SILVER KNIFE.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.649
Ah.

23:39.649 --> 23:41.150
(sirens wailing)

23:41.150 --> 23:42.992
(indistinct conversations
continue)

23:42.992 --> 23:44.754
GOOD.

23:44.754 --> 23:46.125
(wailing continues)

23:46.125 --> 23:47.827
OKAY, NOW HERE'S THE THING--

23:47.827 --> 23:49.929
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY
PUT YOUR WEIGHT INTO IT.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.801
TRY FOR SMOOTH CUTS,
OKAY?

23:51.801 --> 23:53.833
OKAY. (pants)

23:53.833 --> 23:56.435
Now you see that area
just below the tourniquet?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.937
That's where
you're gonna cut.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.070
Do it horizontally,
as deep as you can.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.212
(panting)

24:03.212 --> 24:05.545
(mutters)

24:05.545 --> 24:07.116
Are... are you...

24:07.116 --> 24:09.779
are you--are you sure
she's not gonna feel anything?

24:09.779 --> 24:12.652
NO, SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS, DANNY.
SHE WON'T FEEL A THING.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.654
(man speaks indistinctly)

24:14.654 --> 24:15.955
Okay.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.487
(static crackles)

24:17.487 --> 24:19.959
(pants)

24:19.959 --> 24:21.491
(inhales deeply)

24:21.491 --> 24:22.662
(grunts)

24:22.662 --> 24:23.893
(pants)

24:23.893 --> 24:26.095
I-I can't.

24:26.095 --> 24:28.037
DANNY...

24:28.037 --> 24:29.799
take that blue towel

24:29.799 --> 24:31.941
and cover her face.

24:31.941 --> 24:33.643
It'll help.

24:33.643 --> 24:36.706
(panting)

24:44.584 --> 24:48.157
(continues panting)

24:48.157 --> 24:50.990
(grunts)

24:50.990 --> 24:52.692
(static crackles)

24:52.692 --> 24:55.825
ALL RIGHT, NOW REMEMBER TO PUT
YOUR WEIGHT BEHIND IT, OKAY?

24:55.825 --> 24:57.527
HERE WE GO.

24:57.527 --> 24:58.528
(pants)

24:58.528 --> 25:00.269
(Callie) One...

25:00.269 --> 25:02.001
(panting)

25:02.001 --> 25:03.502
TWO...

25:03.502 --> 25:04.834
(continues panting)

25:04.834 --> 25:06.035
three.

25:06.035 --> 25:07.877
OH, GOD!

25:07.877 --> 25:09.679
Oh, God!

25:09.679 --> 25:10.940
OH, GOD!

25:17.116 --> 25:19.518
Ah. I-I hit--
I hit bone.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.720
I-I think I hit bone.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.891
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

25:21.891 --> 25:23.252
OKAY, PUT THE SCALPEL
DOWN NOW.

25:23.252 --> 25:24.854
NOW TAKE THE CURVED CLAMP

25:24.854 --> 25:28.097
AND MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH
BENEATH THE BONE.

25:28.097 --> 25:31.100
(debris creaking)

25:32.962 --> 25:36.606
AH. UGH.

25:36.606 --> 25:38.668
God. God, I-I can't.
Uh, it--it won't--

25:38.668 --> 25:41.741
PUT YOUR HAND IN THE INCISION
TO GET MORE TRACTION.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.072
(pants)

25:43.072 --> 25:44.814
(grunts)

25:44.814 --> 25:46.315
I CAN'T.

25:46.315 --> 25:47.917
DANNY,
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

25:47.917 --> 25:49.779
BUT WE NEED
TO CREATE MORE SPACE

25:49.779 --> 25:51.280
SO YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SAW THROUGH HER BONE.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.122
No, I--
No, I-I can't.

25:53.122 --> 25:55.785
OKAY? THIS--THIS IS MY WIFE.
ALL RIGHT?
(clamp clanks)

25:55.785 --> 25:58.027
I-I--I'm gonna kill her.
She's bleeding now--

25:58.027 --> 25:59.659
DANNY, YOU CAN'T STOP.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.830
No, you need to come down here.
I can't do this.

26:00.830 --> 26:01.991
I WON'T DO THIS!

26:01.991 --> 26:03.693
I'M GOING DOWN.

26:03.693 --> 26:05.034
NO, DR. HUNT, I CAN'T
LET YOU GO DOWN THERE.

26:05.034 --> 26:06.896
HE CAN'T DO IT.
YES, HE CAN.

26:06.896 --> 26:08.237
HE CAN'T.
WE ARE ASKING TOO MUCH.

26:08.237 --> 26:10.840
I'M GOING.
IF IT STARTS TO GO,
I'M BRINGING YOU--

26:10.840 --> 26:12.672
I SHOULD GO.
I'M THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.775
YOU HAVE A WIFE
AND A CHILD.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.807
I'M GOING.

26:17.807 --> 26:20.950
YOU'RE BREAKING UP.
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?

26:20.950 --> 26:24.153
(children shouting
and speaking indistinctly)

26:24.153 --> 26:25.685
(sighs)

26:25.685 --> 26:26.856
(child) HEY!

26:26.856 --> 26:28.117
WHAT?

26:28.117 --> 26:29.759
I HAVE A PLAN.

26:29.759 --> 26:30.920
OKAY.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.221
I'M GONNA BE A MOM.

26:32.221 --> 26:33.923
(children scream)

26:33.923 --> 26:36.826
OKAY... MER,
THERE'S A GIANT SINKHOLE.

26:36.826 --> 26:37.967
TEDDY IS ALL OVER ME.

26:37.967 --> 26:40.029
DON'T PAGE ME 9-1-1 UNLESS
YOU HAVE A SERIOUS--

26:40.029 --> 26:41.931
THIS IS SERIOUS.

26:41.931 --> 26:44.904
MAYBE GETTING FIRED
WAS A GOOD THING.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.606
WHAT DO YOU CHEERFUL PEOPLE SAY
WHEN SOMETHING CRAPPY HAPPENS

26:47.606 --> 26:49.939
AND THEY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
IT WASN'T CRAPPY?

26:49.939 --> 26:50.880
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE?

26:50.880 --> 26:54.784
YEAH. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS.

26:54.784 --> 26:56.085
THIS IS THAT.

26:56.085 --> 26:57.847
AND I CAN...

26:57.847 --> 27:00.089
MAKE JAM AND DRIVE CAR POOL

27:00.089 --> 27:01.951
AND HAVE PLAYGROUPS.

27:01.951 --> 27:04.023
AND MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.195
AND MAYBE I'LL BE
A GREAT MOM.

27:06.195 --> 27:08.327
OKAY. OKAY.
I'M GONNA GO VOMIT.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.700
UH, CALL ME
WHEN MEREDITH COMES BACK.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.831
AND MAYBE YOU WANT TO BE
A MOM, TOO,

27:11.831 --> 27:13.833
AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

27:13.833 --> 27:17.006
(children speaking indistinctly)

27:20.670 --> 27:22.011
I WISH I WANTED A KID.

27:22.011 --> 27:23.943
I WISH I WANTED ONE SO BAD,

27:23.943 --> 27:25.875
'CAUSE THEN
THIS WOULD BE EASY.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.677
I WOULD BE HAPPY.

27:27.677 --> 27:30.319
I'D HAVE OWEN, AND MY LIFE
WOULDN'T BE A MESS.

27:30.319 --> 27:32.151
BUT I DON'T.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.083
(children continue
speaking indistinctly)

27:34.083 --> 27:35.925
I DON'T WANT A KID.

27:35.925 --> 27:37.927
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE JAM.

27:37.927 --> 27:39.889
I-I DON'T WANT
TO CARPOOL.

27:39.889 --> 27:41.360
I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY
DON'T WANT TO BE A MOTHER.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.162
I WANT TO BE A SURGEON,
AND PLEASE...

27:43.162 --> 27:44.864
GET IT.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.295
I NEED SOMEONE TO GET IT.

27:46.295 --> 27:48.197
AND I WISH THAT SOMEONE
WAS OWEN.

27:48.197 --> 27:51.070
I WISH THAT--THAT--
THAT AT ANY MINUTE,

27:51.070 --> 27:52.742
HE'LL GET IT
AND SHOW UP FOR ME,

27:52.742 --> 27:54.744
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

27:54.744 --> 27:57.076
AND YOU'RE MY PERSON.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.378
I NEED YOU TO BE THERE
AT 6:00 TONIGHT

27:59.378 --> 28:01.050
TO HOLD MY HAND,

28:01.050 --> 28:03.783
'CAUSE I AM SCARED, MER,

28:03.783 --> 28:06.155
AND SAD,

28:06.155 --> 28:08.958
'CAUSE MY HUSBAND
DOESN'T GET THAT.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.060
SO I NEED YOU TO.

28:17.827 --> 28:18.968
(indistinct conversations)

28:18.968 --> 28:20.229
I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON.

28:20.229 --> 28:21.931
I KNOW. AWFUL.

28:21.931 --> 28:23.232
(sighs) I GOT
MEREDITH'S SURGERIES.

28:23.232 --> 28:26.075
I'M REAPING JOY FROM THE FACT
THAT MY SISTER GOT FIRED.

28:26.075 --> 28:27.777
A TERRIBLE PERSON
WOULDN'T FEEL TERRIBLE

28:27.777 --> 28:29.478
ABOUT REAPING THE JOY.

28:29.478 --> 28:32.011
OH, UH, JACKSON, JACKSON,

28:32.011 --> 28:33.913
I NEED YOU TO TAKE OVER
ON A COUPLE OF THESE.
I CAN'T.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.415
I HAVE TO SEE A MAN
ABOUT REDOING SOME SUTURES.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.446
PLEASE.

28:37.446 --> 28:40.790
(sirens wailing)

28:40.790 --> 28:41.891
I'LL TAKE ONE.

28:41.891 --> 28:43.722
THANK YOU. BED 4.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.994
(sighs)

28:44.994 --> 28:46.956
BAILEY NEEDS HER SPLEEN PATIENT
TAKEN TO THE O.R.

28:46.956 --> 28:49.428
UH... HE'S IN BED 3.

28:49.428 --> 28:53.362
SO... HE JUST, UM,
HE NEEDS A CONSENT FORM.

28:53.362 --> 28:55.204
MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSENT FORM
GETS PUT ON HIS CHART.

28:55.204 --> 28:56.335
UH, RIGHT.

28:58.107 --> 28:59.068
(exhales)

28:59.068 --> 29:01.911
(children laughing)

29:01.911 --> 29:03.973
(speaking indistinctly)

29:03.973 --> 29:07.176
ZOLA, PEEKABOO.

29:07.176 --> 29:09.118
PEEKABOO.

29:10.279 --> 29:11.981
HI, JANET.

29:11.981 --> 29:13.182
HEY, MEREDITH.

29:13.182 --> 29:14.924
I'M JUST FINISHING UP
YOUR HOME STUDY,

29:14.924 --> 29:16.255
AND I THOUGHT I'D CHECK
AND SEE HOW ZOLA'S DOING.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.957
SHE IS DOING GREAT.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.929
I HEARD ABOUT THE SINKHOLE
ON THE RADIO.

29:19.929 --> 29:21.791
I FIGURED
YOU'D BE BUSY TODAY.

29:21.791 --> 29:24.363
YEAH, I'M JUST, UH,
IN BETWEEN SURGERIES.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.896
SO...
HOW ARE THINGS GOING?

29:26.896 --> 29:28.437
IS SHE SLEEPING
THROUGH THE NIGHT?

29:28.437 --> 29:29.999
UM...

29:29.999 --> 29:31.941
NO, I--NOT REALLY.

29:31.941 --> 29:34.043
UM, SHE'S UP A FEW TIMES.
BUT IT'S FINE. I DON'T MIND.

29:34.043 --> 29:35.975
JUST YOU, OR ARE YOU GUYS
TAKING TURNS?

29:35.975 --> 29:39.008
NO, HE'S GREAT WITH HER.
HE'S--DEREK'S GREAT WITH HER.

29:39.008 --> 29:41.380
DR. GREY, ARE YOU
TAKING ZOLA HOME NOW?

29:41.380 --> 29:45.154
BECAUSE IT SAYS HERE THAT
DR. SHEPHERD'S GOT HER TONIGHT.

29:45.154 --> 29:47.987
WAIT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU TWO AREN'T TOGETHER?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.118
NO. WE ARE.

29:49.118 --> 29:51.420
WE TAKE TURNS DROPPING HER OFF
AND PICKING HER UP.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.862
I'M NOT TAKING HER HOME.

29:52.862 --> 29:55.794
I JUST CAME TO, UH,
TO--TO SAY HI.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.496
I ACTUALLY
SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.129
(whispers)
OKAY, ZOLA. I'M GONNA GO.

30:00.129 --> 30:01.130
OKAY.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.331
(normal voice) IT WAS NICE
TO SEE YOU, JANET.

30:02.331 --> 30:03.873
YOU, TOO, MEREDITH.

30:03.873 --> 30:06.876
(Zola fussing)

30:08.577 --> 30:10.509
HOW'S NICKY DOING?

30:10.509 --> 30:12.511
I GOTTA DO
MY FINAL EXPLORATION,

30:12.511 --> 30:15.184
CHECK FOR ANY MISSED BLEEDERS,
AND THEN I'M OUT.

30:15.184 --> 30:16.886
THE KID HAD
A RENAL ARTERY THROMBOSIS.

30:16.886 --> 30:18.587
I THOUGHT HIS KIDNEY
WAS A GONER,

30:18.587 --> 30:20.890
BUT ALEX DID AN INTERPOSITION
GRAFT AND SAVED IT.

30:20.890 --> 30:22.121
HE'S DOING AN AMAZING JOB.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.522
I NEED TO STABILIZE
HIS SPINAL FRACTURE.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.024
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT,

30:25.024 --> 30:26.525

32:39.428 --> 32:41.590
AND THAT SOME RED FLAGS
WENT UP.

32:41.590 --> 32:43.332
WELL, I DID SEE HER EARLIER,
BUT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

32:43.332 --> 32:45.264
(pager beeps)

32:45.264 --> 32:46.595
I GOTTA GO.
I GOT A SURGERY.

32:46.595 --> 32:48.537
WELL, I'LL--I'LL TALK
TO JANET AND I'LL--

32:48.537 --> 32:51.000
NO. DON'T.
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.341
DON'T TALK TO HER.
I WILL TALK CARE OF THIS.

32:52.341 --> 32:53.572
YOU'VE ALREADY...
DON'T TALK TO HER.

32:56.005 --> 32:57.506
DR. SLOAN, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA BE REALLY IMPRESSED

32:57.506 --> 32:59.448
BY THE BURIED SUTURES
I DID HERE.

32:59.448 --> 33:01.180
(clears throat)
(sighs) AFTER YOU.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.613
(indistinct conversations)

33:04.613 --> 33:07.486
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.
IT IS.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.188
GENDER REASSIGNMENT, HUH?

33:09.188 --> 33:10.459
YEAH.

33:10.459 --> 33:11.720
NORMALLY THEY DON'T TEACH THAT
TILL NEXT YEAR.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.492
THAT'S A MISTAKE.
THIS IS NOT--

33:13.492 --> 33:15.364
CALL ME WHEN YOU FIND
THE RIGHT PATIENT.

33:15.364 --> 33:17.096
(chuckles) I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.527
HEY, UH, I NEED YOU
TO PREP TRAUMA 1.

33:18.527 --> 33:20.529
WE GOT ANOTHER
SINKHOLE VICTIM ON THE WAY.

33:20.529 --> 33:22.231
STOP ASKING ME TO DO YOUR WORK.
DO IT YOURSELF.

33:22.231 --> 33:23.702
AND HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME
WHERE JERRY HOFFMAN IS?
WHAT?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.204
JERRY HOFFMAN?

33:25.204 --> 33:27.436
UM, UH, WELL, HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE IN BED 1.

33:27.436 --> 33:29.378
THAT'S WHAT THE BOARD SAYS.
HE'S NOT THERE?

33:29.378 --> 33:32.381
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
HE'S THERE?

33:32.381 --> 33:34.783
OH, WAIT.
WAIT. THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT,

33:34.783 --> 33:37.116
'CAUSE IF THE PATIENT
FROM BED 2 IS IN BED ONE,

33:37.116 --> 33:39.618
THEN THAT MEANS THE PATIENT
FROM BED 3 MUST BE...

33:39.618 --> 33:41.220
OH, NO.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.053
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:44.053 --> 33:45.554
THE PATIENT IS
MR. CHUCK WALLACE.

33:45.554 --> 33:47.596
HE'S HAVING A SPLENECTOMY
SECONDARY TO INJURIES

33:47.596 --> 33:49.027
SUSTAINED IN THE SINKHOLE.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.359
YES, DR. GREY,
LET'S MOVE ON

33:50.359 --> 33:51.660
BEFORE MY PATIENT BLEEDS OUT.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.462
OKAY, I'M ALMOST READY
DR. BAILEY.

33:53.462 --> 33:55.033
I JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE NURSE

33:55.033 --> 33:57.736
SHOW ME THE CONSENT FORM
AS PART OF THE CHECKLIST.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.209
(scoffs) SCALPEL.

34:00.209 --> 34:02.271
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:02.271 --> 34:03.412
WAIT A SECOND.

34:03.412 --> 34:05.414
DR. GREY, YOU'RE STERILE.
WHAT ARE YOU--

34:05.414 --> 34:07.376
OKAY, HOLD--HOLD ON.
WAIT A MINUTE. I'M--

34:07.376 --> 34:10.519
I THINK THAT THERE--
SOMETHING MIGHT BE... OFF.

34:10.519 --> 34:13.582
I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE
THIS IS...

34:13.582 --> 34:15.724
NOT OUR PATIENT.

34:15.724 --> 34:18.387
THEN WHOSE PATIENT IS IT?

34:18.387 --> 34:19.688
I DON'T--I DON'T--
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

34:19.688 --> 34:21.330
I JUST--I--

34:21.330 --> 34:23.332
YOU DON'T KNOW? I'M HOLDING
A SCALPEL IN MY HAND.

34:23.332 --> 34:25.494
I THINK YOU HAD BETTER
FIND OUT.

34:25.494 --> 34:27.136
STOP! DON'T CUT!

34:27.136 --> 34:28.597
UH, IT'S THE WRONG PATIENT.

34:28.597 --> 34:31.470
THAT'S MR. JARVIS,
WHO NEEDS A LUNG RESECTION,

34:31.470 --> 34:33.502
NOT MR. WALLACE
WITH A SPLENIC HEMORRHAGE.

34:33.502 --> 34:35.644
I-I'M--I'M SORRY.

34:35.644 --> 34:38.107
I-I-I AM SO,SOSORRY.

34:38.107 --> 34:41.110
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:45.154 --> 34:47.156
WOULD YOU MAKE SURE
THIS GETS TO

34:47.156 --> 34:49.118
THE MEDICAL STAFF OFFICE,
PLEASE?

34:49.118 --> 34:50.659
(woman) YES, DOCTOR.

34:50.659 --> 34:54.293
(indistinct conversations)

34:54.293 --> 34:56.525
MEREDITH.

34:56.525 --> 34:57.796
WHAT?

34:57.796 --> 34:59.728
(indistinct conversations
continue)

34:59.728 --> 35:01.270
NOTHING.

35:01.270 --> 35:03.572
GREY, WE'VE GOT A GUY WITH
SEVERE CRUSH INJURIES,

35:03.572 --> 35:05.334
AND CALLIE'S COME IN
WITH A FIELD AMPUTATION.

35:05.334 --> 35:07.676
LET'S MOVE. WE GOTTA GET
THESE TRAUMA ROOMS READY--

35:07.676 --> 35:10.509
I GOT FIRED. OKAY?
I GOT FIRED.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.510
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.412
YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.813
(pager beeps)

35:14.813 --> 35:16.715
I HAVE TO GO. I HAVE A...

35:16.715 --> 35:17.716
OWEN.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.419
(sirens wailing)

35:20.419 --> 35:22.451
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
THE ABORTION.

35:22.451 --> 35:24.393
SHE WANTS TO AND SHE CAN'T
DO IT BECAUSE OF YOU,

35:24.393 --> 35:25.594
BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU.

35:25.594 --> 35:29.758
AND INSTEAD OF LOVING HER,
YOU'RE PUNISHING HER.

35:29.758 --> 35:31.200
FOR WHAT?

35:31.200 --> 35:33.562
FOR BEING THE WOMAN THAT
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH?

35:33.562 --> 35:36.205
THIS ISN'T ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
WILL HAPPEN TO CRISTINA

35:36.205 --> 35:38.567
IF SHE HAS A KID
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT?

35:38.567 --> 35:39.868
IT WILL ALMOST KILL HER.

35:39.868 --> 35:41.770
TRYING TO PRETEND
THAT SHE LOVES A KID

35:41.770 --> 35:43.872
AS MUCH AS SHE LOVES SURGERY
WILL ALMOST KILL HER,

35:43.872 --> 35:45.874
AND IT'LL ALMOST KILL
YOUR KID.

35:45.874 --> 35:48.517
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE RAISED BY SOMEONE

35:48.517 --> 35:49.878
WHO DIDN'T WANT YOU?

35:49.878 --> 35:51.820
I DO.

35:51.820 --> 35:54.223
TO KNOW YOU STOOD IN THE WAY
OF YOUR MOTHER'S CAREER?

35:54.223 --> 35:56.455
I DO.
I WAS RAISED BY A CRISTINA.

35:56.455 --> 35:59.558
MY MOTHERWASA CRISTINA.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.760
AND AS THE CHILD
SHE DIDN'T WANT,

36:01.760 --> 36:04.693
I AM TELLING YOU,
DON'T DO THIS TO HER,

36:04.693 --> 36:06.695
BECAUSE SHE'S KIND
AND SHE CARES

36:06.695 --> 36:08.397
AND SHE WON'T MAKE IT.

36:08.397 --> 36:10.439
THE GUILT OF RESENTING
HER OWN KID

36:10.439 --> 36:12.241
WILL EAT HER ALIVE.

36:12.241 --> 36:13.402
(door opens)

36:13.402 --> 36:14.643
(man) ALL RIGHT.
COMING THROUGH.

36:14.643 --> 36:18.807
(indistinct conversations)

36:26.355 --> 36:27.416
NO ONE WAS UPDATING THE BOARD

36:27.416 --> 36:29.318
EVEN THOUGH I KEPT
TELLING THEM TO.

36:29.318 --> 36:31.320
I KNOW, I KNOW. I-I HAVE TO
MAKE PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.562
BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS, I'VE BEEN
CHIEF RESIDENT FOR 12 HOURS,

36:33.562 --> 36:36.525
AND--AND YES,
A MAN COULD'VE LOST HIS--

36:36.525 --> 36:38.227
HIS PERFECTLY GOOD SPLEEN,

36:38.227 --> 36:40.529
BUT HE DIDN'T
BECAUSE OF A CHECKLIST

36:40.529 --> 36:41.970
THAT I IMPLEMENTED.

36:41.970 --> 36:43.502
(grunts, elevator bell dings)

36:43.502 --> 36:44.973
NOT THAT
THAT EXCUSES WHAT HAPPENED.

36:44.973 --> 36:46.905
(doors open)
I--

36:46.905 --> 36:48.507
Y--

36:48.507 --> 36:50.239
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
JUST YELL AT ME.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.210
I CAN TAKE IT.
AR--

36:52.210 --> 36:53.942
IT--IT'S OKAY.

36:53.942 --> 36:55.414
(mutters)

36:55.414 --> 36:58.247
S--

36:58.247 --> 36:59.688
J--

37:01.420 --> 37:04.323
NO, I-I--I CAN--
I CAN TAKE IT.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.895
REALLY. I-I SWEAR,
I CAN TAKE IT. I--

37:06.895 --> 37:08.226
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:08.226 --> 37:11.400
(Teddy) HOW DEEP
ARE YOU PLACING THE TUBE?

37:11.400 --> 37:13.262
21 CENTIMETERS

37:13.262 --> 37:15.264
EXACTLY.

37:15.264 --> 37:17.406
HALLELUJAH, I'M IN.

37:17.406 --> 37:18.867
(beeping continues)

37:18.867 --> 37:20.008
GREAT.

37:20.008 --> 37:23.572
NOW EXPLAIN WHY YOU CHOSE
THAT SIZE ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE.

37:23.572 --> 37:25.774
BECAUSE I'M IN MY FIFTH YEAR
OF RESIDENCY

37:25.774 --> 37:28.817
AND I KNOW WHAT SIZE TUBE
TO USE FOR A BASIC INTUBATION.

37:28.817 --> 37:30.719
WHY ARE YOU TREATING ME
LIKE A FIRST YEAR?

37:30.719 --> 37:33.282
BECAUSE NO ONE EVER DID.

37:33.282 --> 37:34.583
I BET YOUR FIRST YEAR,

37:34.583 --> 37:37.326
YOU COULD DO THINGS BETTER
THAN MOST THIRD YEARS.

37:37.326 --> 37:39.558
WELL, YES, I COULD.
WHY ARE YOU PUNISHING ME FOR IT?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.330
I'M HAPPY.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.962
THAT MAKES ME
SEE YOU DIFFERENTLY.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.534
YOUR ARROGANCE
IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

37:45.534 --> 37:48.467
YOU'RE ARROGANT
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO GOOD.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.639
PEOPLE LET YOU SLIDE BY,
SKIP STEPS.

37:50.639 --> 37:52.040
THEY GAVE YOU THE HARD STUFF

37:52.040 --> 37:53.542
BUT LET YOU SKIP
THE EASY STUFF.

37:53.542 --> 37:55.544
I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT YOU CAN TELL ME

37:55.544 --> 37:57.376
HOW TO DO
A CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.308
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT YOU CAN TELL ME

37:59.308 --> 38:02.681
WHY YOU CHOSE THAT SIZE
ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE.

38:04.553 --> 38:05.884
(beeping continues)

38:05.884 --> 38:08.317
(pager beeps)

38:09.988 --> 38:11.320
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU HEARD,

38:11.320 --> 38:13.922
BUT MEREDITH GREY
IS ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED...

38:13.922 --> 38:15.424
(sighs)

38:15.424 --> 38:17.396
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.368
YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

38:22.070 --> 38:23.732
NOT NOW, KAREV.
I'M IN NO MOOD.

38:23.732 --> 38:25.834
YOU NEED TO GET MEREDITH
HER JOB BACK.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.035
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'VE BEEN DOING?

38:27.035 --> 38:29.037
I'VE SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING
TRYING TO GET HER A JOB.

38:29.037 --> 38:30.439
MEREDITH DOESN'T NEEDAJOB.

38:30.439 --> 38:31.910
SHE NEEDSTHISJOB.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.682
THE BOARD'S ALREADY MADE
THEIR DECISION.

38:33.682 --> 38:35.384
LET ME TALK TO THEM.

38:35.384 --> 38:37.386
I MEAN, MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I SAW.

38:37.386 --> 38:40.048
MAYBE I-I-I-I LIED TO GET
THE CHIEF RESIDENT--
I CAN'T LET YOU SAY THAT.

38:40.048 --> 38:41.350
OH, THE HELL YOU CAN'T.

38:44.753 --> 38:46.795
KAREV, THIS IS NOT ON YOU.

38:46.795 --> 38:49.398
(pager beeps)

38:49.398 --> 38:51.530
YEAH, IT IS.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.432
IT'S ALL ON ME.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.634
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

38:55.634 --> 38:58.336
(Mark)
LOOKS PERFECT, JERRY.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.470
SECOND TIME'S THE CHARM.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.412
SUTURES LOOK A LOT BETTER.

39:03.412 --> 39:04.773
REALLY?

39:04.773 --> 39:05.944
THAT'S GREAT.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.346
NO. NO, NO. NOT GREAT.
BETTER.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.978
WHICH ISN'T SAYING MUCH
CONSIDERING THE CRAPPY JOB

39:09.978 --> 39:11.450
YOU DID THE FIRST TIME.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.822
YOU--YOU JUST SAID
IT LOOKED A LOT BETTER, S--

39:13.822 --> 39:15.854
THIS GUY JUST FELL
INTO A SINKHOLE,

39:15.854 --> 39:17.556
HIS KID'S IN SURGERY,

39:17.556 --> 39:19.127
AND NOW HE'S GOT A SCAR

39:19.127 --> 39:20.789
TO REMIND HIM
OF THIS TERRIBLE DAY

39:20.789 --> 39:22.391
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

39:22.391 --> 39:23.962
YOU WANT
TO GO TELL HIM THAT,

39:23.962 --> 39:25.464
BIG SHOT?

39:25.464 --> 39:26.965
GO AHEAD.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.398
DR. SLOAN.

39:29.398 --> 39:31.139
IS NICKY OUT OF SURGERY?

39:31.139 --> 39:33.742
UH, DR. AVERY WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GO CHECK ON THAT.

39:33.742 --> 39:37.375
(pager beeps)

39:37.375 --> 39:39.448
UM...

39:42.581 --> 39:44.413
WAIT.
BAILEY PAGED YOU, TOO?

39:44.413 --> 39:45.714
ANY IDEA WHY?

39:45.714 --> 39:47.716
WHO CARES? AS LONG AS IT
GETS ME AWAY FROM ALTMAN.

39:47.716 --> 39:48.987
(April) OH, GOD.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.989
SHE'S GONNA FIRE US,
ISN'T SHE?

39:50.989 --> 39:52.120
WHY WOULD SHE FIRE US?

39:52.120 --> 39:54.122
THERE WAS THAT PATIENT MIX-UP
IN THE O.R.

39:54.122 --> 39:55.824
OH.YOUSHOULD BE FIRED.

39:55.824 --> 39:58.727
ME? YOU GUYS
DIDN'T UPDATE THE BOARD.

39:58.727 --> 40:01.069
THAT'S WHY SHE LOOKS
SO PISSED OFF.

40:01.069 --> 40:04.402
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

40:04.402 --> 40:07.506
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR IT.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.478
UH, LET ME SEE
THAT CHART.

40:09.478 --> 40:11.179
WHAT IS SHE LOOKING FOR?

40:11.179 --> 40:14.883
(indistinct conversations)

40:14.883 --> 40:16.485
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

40:16.485 --> 40:18.887
(Callie) A FIELD AMPUTATION
WITH COMPLICATED EXTRICATIONS.

40:18.887 --> 40:21.419
STILL ASSESSING HER
MULTIPLE CRUSH INJURIES,

40:21.419 --> 40:22.791
BUT I FELT A BROKEN PELVIS
FOR SURE,

40:22.791 --> 40:24.923
AND HER B.P.'s IN THE TOILET.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.856
YEAH, THIS IS A GUNTHER.

40:27.856 --> 40:29.057
REALLY?

40:29.057 --> 40:30.128
REALLY.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.061
THINK THEY CAN HANDLE
A GUNTHER?

40:33.061 --> 40:37.105
OH, I THINK THEYNEED
A GUNTHER.

40:37.105 --> 40:38.206
UH, WHAT'S A GUNTHER?

40:40.909 --> 40:43.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

40:43.041 --> 40:45.544
HEY. I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S UP?

40:45.544 --> 40:48.717
WE SHOULD WAIT TILL
YOUR HUSBAND GETS HERE.

40:48.717 --> 40:50.479
YOU PAGED DEREK?

40:50.479 --> 40:51.920
WELL, HE'S IN SURGERY.
THAT COULD TAKE HOURS.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.822
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

(Benjamin Francis Leftwich's
"Box of Stones" playing)

40:56.154 --> 40:57.626
I COULD TELL
SOMETHING WAS UP

40:57.626 --> 40:59.628
WHEN I RAN INTO YOU
AT ZOLA'S DAY CARE

40:59.628 --> 41:02.190
SO I MADE SOME CALLS.

41:02.190 --> 41:04.493
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

41:04.493 --> 41:06.595
IF YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU HAD BEEN FIRED

41:06.595 --> 41:08.967
AND THAT YOU AND DR. SHEPHERD
WERE LIVING APART.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.839
BUT I CAN EXPLAIN--
I'M SURE YOU CAN.

41:10.839 --> 41:12.741
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND MY CONCERN.

41:12.741 --> 41:16.244
SO--SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

41:16.244 --> 41:17.806
LET'S NOT EVEN GO THERE.

41:17.806 --> 41:19.207
WELL, THEY COULDN'T
TAKE ZOLA, RIGHT?

41:19.207 --> 41:21.209
(elevator bell dings)
I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABLE

41:21.209 --> 41:23.211
DISCUSSING THIS
WITHOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

41:23.211 --> 41:24.883
WELL, THIS IS URGENT,
SO I'LL GO GET HIM

41:24.883 --> 41:26.685
AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
