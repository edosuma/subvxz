We spent the entire day
at Abercrombie's.

02:08:09.744 --> 02:08:12.747
Thanks, Auntie Mame, but it's
just out of the question.

02:08:12.747 --> 02:08:13.748
Absolutely.

02:08:15.249 --> 02:08:17.751
You know what the trouble
with you two is?

02:08:17.752 --> 02:08:18.753
You don't live.

02:08:18.753 --> 02:08:20.755
Life's a banquet,

02:08:20.755 --> 02:08:23.758
and most poor sons of bitches
are starving to death.

02:08:49.283 --> 02:08:51.285
One thing you've
got to understand:

02:08:51.285 --> 02:08:52.786
School begins
day after Labor Day.

02:08:52.787 --> 02:08:54.288
He's gotta
be back by then.

02:08:54.288 --> 02:08:56.290
Of course, Labor Day.

02:08:56.290 --> 02:08:57.791
Sometime in November,
isn't it?

02:09:14.308 --> 02:09:16.310
Oh, Peter,
I'm going to show you things

02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:19.313
you never dreamed existed.
