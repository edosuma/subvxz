02:07.877 --> 02:10.255
Taking advantage of
the trouble in Pittsburgh,

02:10.338 --> 02:14.050
The Union of Justice headquarters
was robbed.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.555
But the stolen item was
quickly retrieved by Praetorian.

02:18.638 --> 02:22.809
Praetorian's recent activity
has really been quite brilliant!

02:22.892 --> 02:27.021
My daughter's bedroom
is plastered with Praetorian posters.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.607
Don't get jealous of those superheroes.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.442
You don't stand a chance against them!

02:41.286 --> 02:43.204
That guy ain't no superhero!

02:43.288 --> 02:47.417
That bum's in cahoots with Matts!
He's just a downright thug!

02:51.963 --> 02:53.006
I'm takin' a leak.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.341
We need to get revenge on that guy!

02:55.425 --> 02:56.676
You sure talk big.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.021
Gramps, slow down.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.398
Shut up!

03:11.065 --> 03:12.358
Pour me another right now!

03:12.942 --> 03:15.111
That's right!
I ain't letting them get away with this!

03:16.279 --> 03:17.697
What are we gonna do

03:17.780 --> 03:20.325
now that Orlok got rubbed out
and the helmet was taken back?

03:20.408 --> 03:22.035
We didn't even get a cent.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.622
We're no match for Matts and Praetorian.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.459
Can you grow back
if your brains have been blown up?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.544
If my brains have been blown up?

03:32.211 --> 03:35.548
My jaw grew back when it got ripped off.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.092
This is why I hate working with
a team that I can't choose.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.845
How can you say that when we rescued--

03:40.929 --> 03:42.931
I never asked you to rescue me.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.474
How dare you!

03:44.557 --> 03:45.475
What?

03:46.017 --> 03:49.520
This is so depressing,
I'm about to lose my mind.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.273
So long.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.694
Thanks for getting my hopes up
that I might see 50 million dollars,

03:56.778 --> 03:57.654
Carmine.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.324
I had low expectations from the start.

04:01.407 --> 04:05.119
A ragtag group of obscure villains
could never outsmart superheroes.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.043
If you're leaving,
then get the fuck outta here, jerk!

04:12.126 --> 04:15.546
Nobody wants to hear you lecture us!

04:15.630 --> 04:17.215
That was close!

04:17.298 --> 04:21.135
You just about chopped
Mr. Handsome's face in half!

04:26.641 --> 04:28.726
Now you've asked for it!

04:30.061 --> 04:31.354
Hey! Come on, you guys!

04:48.329 --> 04:49.831
Wait! Kasey!

04:56.754 --> 04:58.131
-Forecast!
-Cut it out!

04:58.214 --> 04:59.549
Fine!

04:59.632 --> 05:02.385
All right already, Forecast!

05:04.887 --> 05:07.557
What do you have to say
to villains across the country?

05:08.266 --> 05:11.394
There is no place
for you villains in the USA.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.941
Your fate is to grow old and die
as despised and forgotten people.

05:17.525 --> 05:22.322
We will never let up on you people
until you're utterly eliminated.

05:22.905 --> 05:27.910
You scum will disappear from this earth
without leaving a single trace.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.329
Wow! How reassuring!

05:29.954 --> 05:32.332
That was Praetorian! Thank you!

06:02.737 --> 06:06.032
I'm in the newspapers…

06:07.283 --> 06:08.242
Carmine.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.535
Only when he got caught.

06:09.619 --> 06:13.206
Jeez! I've banned him so many times,
but he keeps coming back.

06:13.289 --> 06:17.877
This was supposed to be
the biggest job ever for gramps.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.296
That'll never happen.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.965
This loser has never
made it past being a petty thief.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.468
Hanging around him will only hurt you.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.385
Before you leave,

06:27.053 --> 06:31.015
you'll pay for his drinks
and to clean up this place, right?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.419
It's been a while
since I drove this truck.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.631
No way! That burger joint closed down?

07:04.215 --> 07:07.218
Damn! I never even ate there once.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.059
This song's one of your favorites, right?

07:27.029 --> 07:28.072
Honey…

07:31.200 --> 07:32.285
Dammit!

07:32.368 --> 07:34.537
How come things never go right?

07:35.913 --> 07:39.250
I've waited forever for this!
So why did this happen?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.377
I even went to night school!

07:42.044 --> 07:43.629
I'm such a total idiot!

07:45.131 --> 07:46.674
I've had it!

08:20.208 --> 08:22.418
Even if we're not villains,
I want to be with you forever.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.673
Even if we're never offered
a big job again,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.009
let's live together happily.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.637
Are you serious?

08:34.680 --> 08:35.515
Where's the ring?

08:44.315 --> 08:48.069
Kasey, will you marry me?

08:49.278 --> 08:52.990
You're only saying that
because you saw this church.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.243
Sorry to interrupt you
at a time like this,

08:55.326 --> 08:57.745
but this church is
going to be torn down soon!

08:58.579 --> 08:59.997
Perfect timing.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.958
Let's throw away our pasts

09:02.041 --> 09:05.503
and live ordinary,
respectable lives together.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.262
Honey?

09:57.638 --> 09:58.681
Coming!

10:00.474 --> 10:03.394
If this is the wedding decoration,
take them directly to…

10:05.605 --> 10:06.439
What?

10:07.273 --> 10:08.107
Whatever…

10:15.323 --> 10:17.658
Tonight's your last night
as a single man, Johnny!

10:17.742 --> 10:18.784
Yeah!

10:20.286 --> 10:21.370
What?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.171
We don't serve villains here.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.511
You scammed us!

10:37.595 --> 10:39.347
That dude was
doing the dancing the whole time!

10:39.430 --> 10:41.015
This is exactly why

10:41.891 --> 10:45.603
you can't trust
any business run by villains!

10:49.190 --> 10:51.108
If I don't get home, my baby will--

10:51.192 --> 10:54.570
Transmit says
he still hasn't had enough to drink.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.489
Yeah!

11:00.826 --> 11:03.746
We ain't got money to buy more drinks.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.789
Not just that,

11:05.331 --> 11:08.542
I've got… I'm getting married tomorrow…

11:16.425 --> 11:17.968
Awesome!

11:18.052 --> 11:21.055
This is how I survived when I was a kid.

11:21.138 --> 11:24.809
This is where
the legend of Johnny Bolt started.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.602
Let's get a little more.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.105
Yeah, a little more won't hurt.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.689
-It sure won't!
-It sure won't!

11:33.275 --> 11:35.111
Say, Johnny,

11:35.194 --> 11:40.116
don't you think you should make
your last job a big one for Kasey's sake?

11:40.199 --> 11:43.285
Nah. I'm gonna get married
and work an ordinary--

11:43.369 --> 11:48.374
Someone once said that money is always
why marriage for love ends in divorce.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.127
Now, who was it that said that?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.547
It was my mom!

11:54.630 --> 11:56.257
She was crying when she said it.

11:56.340 --> 12:01.095
Johnny, you don't want your wife to suffer
'cause you're short on money, right?

12:01.178 --> 12:04.640
There's a ton of ATMs
on this street alone.

12:07.768 --> 12:11.105
These new ones all got cameras on 'em!

12:13.482 --> 12:14.316
Here!

12:14.859 --> 12:18.446
We thought this might happen,
so we packed these in the car.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.030
Yeah.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.784
You gotta pay for
that wedding too, Johnny.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.495
Just one more time? For Kasey's sake.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.505
People of San Francisco!

12:36.589 --> 12:39.008
Good morning!

12:48.684 --> 12:49.602
Yeah!

12:51.395 --> 12:52.229
Yeah!

12:56.609 --> 12:57.443
Here.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.031
This is the only way to live!

13:02.114 --> 13:04.742
Nah! I've changed!

13:05.326 --> 13:08.204
My wonderful honey! I love you!

13:08.871 --> 13:11.790
Johnny! You should get Kasey a present!

13:11.874 --> 13:13.292
A present?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.794
A present for my angel?

13:15.878 --> 13:18.172
A present for my angel…

13:18.255 --> 13:20.799
A present for my angel…

13:21.550 --> 13:22.384
That's the place!

13:24.220 --> 13:25.471
A bookstore? How come?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.557
What does it matter?
Just pull over there, Frostbite!

13:29.558 --> 13:31.685
But I can't stop this!

13:31.769 --> 13:33.395
Let there be bad luck!

13:49.828 --> 13:52.581
That hurts… Why the hell a bookstore?

13:53.123 --> 13:55.459
For school textbooks for my angel!

13:55.543 --> 13:56.961
Textbooks?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.045
That's right.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.215
She said MBA textbooks
are ridiculously expensive.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.968
What a dumb present.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.721
My wife's really smart.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.850
Shit! It's the cops! Let's scram!

14:11.934 --> 14:14.687
Grab all the books that say "MBA"!

14:20.067 --> 14:22.403
I can't let myself get caught!

14:26.448 --> 14:27.283
Yeah.

14:37.084 --> 14:37.918
Yeah!

14:43.841 --> 14:47.177
Stay calm! We don't want to hurt anyone!

14:47.761 --> 14:49.889
It's an honor to meet you, Praetorian.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.682
How many robbers are there?

14:51.765 --> 14:55.352
Four. They got on a train
two stations before this one.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.355
Get a paddy wagon to the next station.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.773
It'll only take
a few minutes to handle this.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.328
What shitty luck.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.887
I can't let myself get caught today!

15:31.263 --> 15:33.098
I'm going to go straight!

15:38.103 --> 15:39.688
Honey! Wait for me!

16:09.802 --> 16:11.553
Another fine achievement.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.222
Who cares about that?

16:13.764 --> 16:14.932
You don't either, right?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.810
What's important is that justice prevails.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.770
Precisely.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.279
My sweetheart…

16:38.288 --> 16:39.123
Yo!

16:39.206 --> 16:41.208
You're back sooner than I expected.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.585
Welcome back, Johnny.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.258
Finally, you're back.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.968
It's your move, Johnny.

16:54.763 --> 16:55.973
Eric, please!

16:56.640 --> 16:58.100
Let me make one phone call!

16:58.183 --> 16:59.810
Today's my wedding day!

17:00.310 --> 17:01.478
Eric!

17:01.562 --> 17:03.105
Eric!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.871
Maybe he's on the subway
and has no signal.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.832
Have all the guests arrived?

17:24.793 --> 17:30.424
Three guests haven't arrived.
Frostbite, Kismet, and Transmit.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.135
All right. Thank you.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.954
"Thanks to you, I was able to change."

18:02.831 --> 18:04.833
You haven't changed one single bit.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.463
I wonder what's taking so long.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.456
Mommy! Those fireworks are so cool!

18:44.540 --> 18:45.958
They sure are!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.709
Wow!

18:57.511 --> 18:59.096
Slow down now!

19:01.390 --> 19:05.310
News flash! In the trial of
the former superhero, Praetorian,

19:05.394 --> 19:09.606
he was pronounced innocent
of the more than 300 counts against him.

19:09.690 --> 19:14.987
He was charged with taking advantage of
his position as a superhero for years

19:15.070 --> 19:18.949
to regularly commit assault,
blackmail, and sell information, but…

19:20.242 --> 19:22.244
Gladiator has just come outside!

19:22.327 --> 19:24.830
Since you and Praetorian had
a close relationship,

19:24.913 --> 19:29.501
opinion on the Internet is that
you were involved in his crimes too.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.086
Can you comment on that?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.379
Me?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.048
The hell I was!

19:40.262 --> 19:43.640
I've always been suspicious
of that Praetorian.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.226
Innocent my ass!

19:46.310 --> 19:48.520
I heard he hired a super-expensive lawyer.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.982
That itself is proof
he's in cahoots with criminals.

19:52.065 --> 19:54.776
Black 28. Another win.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.737
Wow! That's amazing!

20:00.073 --> 20:03.035
Sir, it looks like your lucky night.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.328
Fantastic!

20:04.411 --> 20:06.288
That's nine times in a row!

20:06.872 --> 20:09.666
Next, I'm putting it all on 18.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.377
If I win this,
I'll get to a million dollars.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.255
All of it, sir? On one number?

20:17.216 --> 20:20.427
Tonight, I've got lady luck with me!

20:20.510 --> 20:23.180
Hey! Leave me out of this, would you!

20:25.515 --> 20:27.684
Hurry up and spin it!

20:28.518 --> 20:31.438
What's going on with table 47?

20:31.521 --> 20:33.065
He's taken us for 400 grand.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.192
There's clearly a precog involved.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.445
We haven't detected the use of
psychic powers inside the casino.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.783
According to the database,
the gambler is definitely The Heat.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.994
Comb the entire premises.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.080
He's definitely up to something.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.085
Carmine, hurry up and get out of there.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.755
Turning 50 bucks into
1.2 million is going too far.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.173
We'll get caught for…

20:59.633 --> 21:02.302
Would you mind stepping out of the car?

21:06.848 --> 21:08.475
Carmine, I'm sorry.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.228
I didn't know what else to do.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.605
Don't be so hard on yourself.

21:15.190 --> 21:19.069
Your name is Walt Flanagan.
Isn't that right?

21:20.195 --> 21:21.280
Yes.

21:28.078 --> 21:32.916
According to the database,
you can see 30 seconds into the future.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.710
That's right.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.339
Then I guess you can see

21:39.923 --> 21:42.968
where this fancy cigar case
will be in 30 seconds, can't you?

21:43.927 --> 21:44.970
Yes, I can.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.432
Such a pity.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.916
Now listen.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.627
I admire your balls.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.755
But this is an excellent chance

22:19.838 --> 22:23.050
to teach you, low-status villains,
how brutal the organization can be.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.511
Salamander… I can't breathe!

22:26.595 --> 22:31.099
Bring me 100 million dollars in one month!

22:34.644 --> 22:36.980
A hundred million. Got it?

22:37.064 --> 22:40.150
And don't try to pull anything stupid.

22:40.233 --> 22:43.361
How in the world
am I supposed to get 100 million dollars?

22:43.445 --> 22:46.156
How should I know?
Why not try knocking off a bank?

22:46.239 --> 22:49.993
May as well end your life
as a petty thief with a bang.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.974
It's only natural you're upset.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.851
I really am sorry.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.853
I've got nothing to say to you. Get out.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.607
I just wanted money to pay for
the wedding. You can understand that.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.819
I don't want to hear it,
even if you're joking!

23:23.902 --> 23:27.197
You're the one who said
you wanted to start an ordinary life.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.533
But you're the one

23:29.616 --> 23:32.619
who tossed that all away
and ruined our… my future!

23:34.329 --> 23:37.082
I just thought we'd need
a little more money

23:37.165 --> 23:38.583
to start an ordinary life.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.752
Must be nice
not to have to pay rent in prison.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.215
What are you working in
a coffee shop like this again for?

23:45.799 --> 23:46.758
What about your MBA?

23:46.842 --> 23:50.137
With smarts like yours, sweetie,
you shouldn't have to work in a place--

23:53.723 --> 23:55.684
MBA?

23:55.767 --> 23:58.103
I punched that groping professor
and got kicked out!

23:58.854 --> 24:01.231
Smarts? You think I'm smart?

24:01.314 --> 24:03.441
My grades were horrible the whole time!

24:04.067 --> 24:08.405
I never even succeeded once
at any big jobs as a villain!

24:13.410 --> 24:16.663
How dare you suddenly show up
and push your male fantasies on me.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.708
I failed my MBA.
I failed at being a villain too!

24:19.791 --> 24:22.836
That's why I'm working
at a coffee shop like this.

24:27.132 --> 24:27.966
Sweetheart…

24:30.051 --> 24:30.969
Get out.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.142
Carmine?

24:41.354 --> 24:43.231
-Carmine!
-What's wrong?

24:43.815 --> 24:46.401
Johnny… Kasey…

24:47.402 --> 24:49.696
I need help…

26:13.488 --> 26:18.493
