00:01.167 --> 00:03.900
(pleasant music)

00:08.233 --> 00:09.467
(car chirps)

00:09.467 --> 00:12.033
(blues music)

00:12.033 --> 00:12.867
* Come on home

00:12.867 --> 00:14.400
* Comin' home baby now

00:14.400 --> 00:16.000
* You know I'm
waiting here for you *

00:16.000 --> 00:18.500
* I'm coming home
now, real soon *

00:18.500 --> 00:19.467
* You've been gone

00:19.467 --> 00:21.067
* Comin' home baby now

00:21.067 --> 00:22.833
* You don't know what
I'm goin' through *

00:22.833 --> 00:25.067
* I'm comin' home,
I know I'm overdue *

00:25.067 --> 00:26.267
* Since you went away

00:26.267 --> 00:29.433
* Expect me any
day now real soon *

00:29.433 --> 00:32.100
* I'm comin' home and
never more to roam *

00:32.100 --> 00:33.400
* Baby tell me you're

00:33.400 --> 00:37.933
* Baby I'm for
sure comin' home *

00:38.867 --> 00:41.100
* I'm comin' home, oh no no

00:41.100 --> 00:43.200
- She was always a devoted wife,

00:43.200 --> 00:45.733
but it was as my adoring mother

00:45.733 --> 00:47.833
that Margaret played
her greatest role,

00:47.833 --> 00:50.233
and I can't imagine
a more wonderful,

00:51.367 --> 00:52.633
this is ridiculous.

00:52.633 --> 00:55.267
I'm not practicing your
eulogy that you wrote.

00:55.267 --> 00:57.467
- This might be the last
chance we have to go over it.

00:57.467 --> 01:00.133
- For the last time,
Mum, you're not sick!

01:00.133 --> 01:02.500
- My blood sugar
has skyrocketed.

01:02.500 --> 01:06.167
- Maybe just try 95% harder.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.667
- I'm depressed.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.367
- Oh Mum, you can survive
on Christmas without me.

01:10.367 --> 01:11.867
- I can't!

01:11.867 --> 01:13.500
Why do you have
to go to New York?

01:13.500 --> 01:14.900
- Because we want to.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.900
We want to show the
children a white Christmas.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.800
- You can have a
white Christmas here.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.300
- Why don't you take up

01:21.300 --> 01:23.700
Auntie June and Uncle
Derek's invitation?

01:23.700 --> 01:25.200
They ask you every year.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.400
- Yuck!

01:26.400 --> 01:28.067
- You love going to
visit them in Adelaide.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.067
- Not at Christmas.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.967
Christmas in Adelaide is like,

01:30.967 --> 01:33.233
like sandals and socks.

01:33.233 --> 01:34.133
- Hot?

01:34.133 --> 01:35.633
- Wrong.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.267
Christmas is with you, and...

01:38.833 --> 01:41.067
This is Danny's idea, isn't it?

01:41.067 --> 01:42.067
To take you away from me?

01:42.067 --> 01:44.667
- Actually, Mum, it was my idea.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.100
I just want one Christmas

01:46.100 --> 01:48.833
that's not complicated
with two families.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.833
- It isn't my fault
that it's complicated!

01:50.833 --> 01:53.300
- It was complicated from the
moment that you adopted me.

01:53.300 --> 01:54.567
- I tried to hide
that for years!

01:54.567 --> 01:55.933
If you hadn't been
such a sticky beak,

01:55.933 --> 01:57.433
nothing would have
been complicated.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.633
- I'm gonna call Auntie June.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.067
- Can you finish
my eulogy first?

02:02.067 --> 02:05.467
Read the funny anecdote about
the time I met Judi Dench.

02:05.467 --> 02:06.967
- When did you meet Judi Dench?

02:06.967 --> 02:09.267
- I'm dead, you
going to quibble?

02:09.267 --> 02:11.400
- She took it pretty
well, considering.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.167
Hey, are you allowed to
write your own eulogy?

02:14.167 --> 02:16.067
- Are you nervous
about flying again?

02:16.067 --> 02:17.467
- No, don't worry.

02:17.467 --> 02:18.800
- Dad?
- Yeah.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.700
- I need to get my Kris
Kringle for school.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.367
Can I get some money
from your wallet?

02:22.367 --> 02:23.733
- Yeah, as long as
you promise not to buy

02:23.733 --> 02:25.233
anything poisonous, or illegal.

02:25.233 --> 02:26.167
- Or explosive.

02:26.167 --> 02:27.700
- Or explosive!

02:27.700 --> 02:29.500
- Anyway, I've
dealt with Margaret.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.600
So glad I got the tricky
one out of the way first.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.967
Julie won't take
it nearly as hard.

02:33.967 --> 02:36.733
(Julie crying)

02:36.733 --> 02:37.833
- Oh I'm sorry.

02:39.267 --> 02:40.600
It's just this.

02:42.067 --> 02:45.067
Do you remember the year that
we lost this little Rudolph?

02:45.067 --> 02:48.067
And Amber thought
Brianna had taken it,

02:48.067 --> 02:49.567
and so she chopped
all her plaits off

02:49.567 --> 02:51.567
while she was sleeping,
and then to get her back,

02:51.567 --> 02:53.500
Brianna dyed all of
Amber's clothes pink,

02:53.500 --> 02:56.900
but it was actually Kayne who
had taken it to fix his nose,

02:56.900 --> 02:59.533
so you both put him
in the wheely bin?

03:00.433 --> 03:01.867
Do you remember?

03:01.867 --> 03:03.600
- Of course we remember, Mum.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.067
- It was last year.

03:05.067 --> 03:08.367
- Can't believe you both
won't be here for Christmas.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.567
- You won't, neither of you?

03:10.567 --> 03:11.967
- Younis and I are
going to Mount Gambia

03:11.967 --> 03:13.233
to be with his family.

03:13.233 --> 03:14.233
- And we're going
off to Townsville

03:14.233 --> 03:15.633
with Evan to see his mom.

03:15.633 --> 03:18.133
- I'm livin' the dream,
spending Christmas

03:18.133 --> 03:19.733
with the school
principal's family.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.300
Can I have everyone's keys?

03:21.300 --> 03:23.467
Pop needs to move the cars
so we can assemble Frosty.

03:23.467 --> 03:24.667
- Frosty?

03:24.667 --> 03:25.767
- The snowman.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.833
You should see him, he's huge.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.967
Our display is finally gonna
be better than the Caravellos'.

03:33.433 --> 03:35.133
- We'll be here to
see the lights, Mum.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.433
- We're not going
'til Christmas Eve.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.567
- I know, I know, I know.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.267
It's not like
everyone's going away.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.800
At least I have Bess.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.267
- Well, yes.

03:42.267 --> 03:44.467
But I did--
- thank God for Bess.

03:44.467 --> 03:46.800
- Aww, actually I wanted--

03:46.800 --> 03:48.067
- Now about Christmas Day.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.733
- Yes, yes, about Christmas.

03:49.733 --> 03:50.933
- I thought it would be easier

03:50.933 --> 03:53.967
if you all came to
stay on Christmas Eve,

03:53.967 --> 03:56.267
and then that way we
could all wake up together

03:56.267 --> 03:58.633
in the morning, and the kids
could open their presents.

03:58.633 --> 03:59.767
- What?

03:59.767 --> 04:00.800
No, that'd be too much.
- No, no, no!

04:00.800 --> 04:02.067
It's not a problem at all,

04:02.067 --> 04:03.767
and it's not like we
won't have the room.

04:04.633 --> 04:07.367
(pleasant music)

04:09.367 --> 04:11.333
- Is the sleigh
in the right posi?

04:11.333 --> 04:13.167
- Um, I reckon.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.733
What do you think, Pop?

04:14.733 --> 04:15.900
- Does the sleigh
look good there?

04:15.900 --> 04:17.567
- Sensational, Kayne.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.600
Santa will be very happy
to drive that sleigh,

04:19.600 --> 04:23.067
as opposed to a certain
other sleigh up the street.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.433
- Do you mean the Caravellos?

04:24.433 --> 04:26.100
- Shh!
- We don't want 'em to think

04:26.100 --> 04:27.567
that we consider
them a threat, Kayne.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.567
First rule of warfare.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.867
- I thought the first rule of
warfare was know your enemy.

04:32.867 --> 04:34.100
- No, because we
know the Caravellos,

04:34.100 --> 04:36.600
and they're very nice people,

04:36.600 --> 04:38.467
so that doesn't help
us go into battle.

04:38.467 --> 04:39.700
- Dad, they're not
a threat at all,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.233
not now we've got
a giant snowman.

04:41.233 --> 04:43.433
- What, what have they got?

04:43.433 --> 04:46.333
- Ah, don't tell me they
got a giant snowman, too?

04:46.333 --> 04:49.067
- Worse, they've got snow.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.167
- Actual snow!

04:54.167 --> 04:55.367
- [Kayne] Looks like
they're gonna cover

04:55.367 --> 04:57.200
the whole front yard,
and the driveway.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.733
- [Boy] For sure they're
gonna do the roof.

04:58.733 --> 05:02.367
- The Caravellos have taken
it to a whole 'nother level.

05:04.267 --> 05:05.500
We're in trouble.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.800
(upbeat music)

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
- Get your "Big Issue!"

05:15.567 --> 05:18.967
- Oh, I'm so sorry,
I thought I had cash.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.200
My son got into my wallet,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.067
and he's taken all my money.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.133
- Sure, mate.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.900
- No no, I don't use cash
for shopping, I use pay pass,

05:29.900 --> 05:32.433
so I never check that
section of the wallet.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.267
I honestly thought I had cash.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.633
- Sure, merry Christmas.

05:36.633 --> 05:37.967
- Yeah.

05:37.967 --> 05:39.300
Merry Christmas.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.900
I feel like you
don't believe me.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.833
Would you accept a box of
gingerbread Christmas trees?

05:46.833 --> 05:49.200
- Would you accept a box of
gingerbread Christmas trees

05:49.200 --> 05:50.767
for work you did?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.133
- No, no, no, I mean as a gift.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.933
I certainly don't
expect a magazine.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.100
Although that probably

05:57.100 --> 05:59.200
would pay for a couple,
but merry Christmas.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.700
(dog barking)
(birds chirping)

06:03.700 --> 06:04.967
- Oscar!

06:04.967 --> 06:07.233
How much money did you
take out of my wallet?

06:07.233 --> 06:10.333
I just had a very
awkward exchange with
the "Big Issue" guy.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.800
- Was it like that
time with the change?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.067
- No.

06:13.067 --> 06:14.667
- 'Cause that was
pretty awkward.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.433
- Because he spent
so long searching for
change from my $20,

06:17.433 --> 06:19.467
and if I say keep the
change, that's fine.

06:19.467 --> 06:23.267
But if he's stalling so that
I say, we are off topic.

06:23.267 --> 06:25.567
How, you took all the
money out of my wallet.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.300
- I needed it for
my Kris Kringle.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.600
- Since when does Kris
Kringle cost more than $5?

06:29.600 --> 06:31.900
What were you doing,
shouting the whole class?

06:33.567 --> 06:34.400
Oscar?

06:36.267 --> 06:38.633
Oscar, why did you
take the money?

06:38.633 --> 06:40.533
Are you in some kind of trouble?

06:40.533 --> 06:41.467
Hey, it's okay mate.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.500
You can tell me, come here.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.333
Hup.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.533
It's all right.

06:46.533 --> 06:47.967
- It's not just
any Kris Kringle.

06:49.433 --> 06:50.833
It's a special Kris Kringle.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.967
I think I've got a crush,

06:54.967 --> 06:56.700
and I want to buy
something really good,

06:56.700 --> 06:57.833
but I don't know what to buy.

06:57.833 --> 07:00.933
- Mate, why didn't you tell me?

07:00.933 --> 07:03.700
You wanna buy something
special for the girl you like,

07:03.700 --> 07:05.667
that's trouble I can help with!

07:06.900 --> 07:08.267
- I don't like a girl, Dad.

07:09.367 --> 07:11.733
- Okay.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.500
I didn't see that coming.

07:14.633 --> 07:17.133
That's, you know, maybe
I did see it coming.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.600
That's fine.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.433
It's fine, it's more than fine!

07:20.433 --> 07:21.800
It's great, okay?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.367
'Cause your choice
is your choice,

07:23.367 --> 07:26.500
and I love you, and
your mother loves you

07:26.500 --> 07:28.200
no matter who you
wanna bring home.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.300
- I think it's against
the school rules.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.833
- Against school rules?

07:32.967 --> 07:34.167
What year is this?

07:34.167 --> 07:35.633
Did someone actually
say that to you?

07:35.633 --> 07:38.400
- I've seen on the news that
teachers get in trouble for it.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.100
I don't know if it's the
same for student teachers.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.667
- Student teach, what
are we talking about?

07:43.667 --> 07:45.667
- Miss Ogilvy, she's
been doing her placement

07:45.667 --> 07:47.133
all this semester.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.100
Would you really be all
right if I brought her home?

07:49.100 --> 07:51.100
- No, Oscar, you can't
bring Miss Ogilvy home.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.333
- But you said I--

07:52.333 --> 07:53.500
- Well, that was when
I thought you were.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.067
- You thought what?

07:55.067 --> 07:57.333
- Nothing, look, you can't
date Miss Ogilvy, okay?

07:57.333 --> 08:01.867
But listen, (sighs) how
about I help you buy her

08:01.867 --> 08:05.167
a nice present to say
thank you for the semester?

08:05.167 --> 08:07.567
(jazz music)

08:08.600 --> 08:10.067
- Mom?

08:10.067 --> 08:11.800
Nanny Margaret just posted
an article on Facebook

08:11.800 --> 08:13.367
that they're forecasting
dangerous blizzards

08:13.367 --> 08:14.400
for New York this Christmas.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.800
- Oh no, let me see!

08:15.800 --> 08:17.200
I hope that we can still go.

08:18.633 --> 08:20.667
Look at the date
of this article.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.133
- 2012.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.067
Why would she post an old,

08:25.100 --> 08:26.400
she doesn't want us to go?

08:26.400 --> 08:28.200
- Which is why she
posted another one

08:28.200 --> 08:31.067
about a New York serial
killer from 1975,

08:31.067 --> 08:33.467
and another story about
the Wall Street crash.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.433
- Poor Nanny Margaret!
(phone dings)

08:35.433 --> 08:37.767
- She'll be with Auntie
June and Uncle Derek.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.300
- Poor Auntie June
and Uncle Derek.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.233
- Dad!

08:40.233 --> 08:41.900
- Nanny Margaret will be fine.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.400
Goodnight, sweetie.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.133
Julie wants me to pick the
stuffing for the turkey.

08:46.133 --> 08:50.067
Craisin and nuts, bacon and
cheese, or prawn risotto?

08:50.067 --> 08:52.300
- Prawn risotto in the turkey?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.833
- Craisin and nuts, I think.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.667
Although bacon and cheese
does sound delicious.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.733
- Yeah, just remind her
you won't be enjoying

08:59.733 --> 09:01.067
the craisin and nut stuffing,

09:01.067 --> 09:02.800
because we have booked
the nonrefundable hotel,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.567
and paid for the
nonrefundable flights.

09:04.567 --> 09:05.633
- I know!

09:05.633 --> 09:06.933
- Do you, though?
- Yes!

09:06.933 --> 09:08.100
I figured out how to do it.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.567
- Oh?
- In public.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.067
- Okay, I'm in.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.300
Clothes on or clothes off?

09:12.300 --> 09:14.300
- No, I figured out
how to tell Julie

09:14.300 --> 09:15.933
that we're going to
New York, in public,

09:15.933 --> 09:17.233
so she can't make a scene.

09:18.733 --> 09:22.067
- So after Wayne and I
had a really good chat,

09:22.067 --> 09:23.533
I felt so much better.

09:23.533 --> 09:24.533
- You did?

09:24.533 --> 09:26.067
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.200
I mean, I'm just gonna have
to let Christmas go this year.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.333
You know, the kids get older,
they meet other people,

09:31.333 --> 09:33.833
I'm just gonna have
to deal with it.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.100
I mean, I can't control

09:35.100 --> 09:38.067
what everybody does
forever now, can I?

09:38.067 --> 09:40.433
- That is great, Julie,
because actually,

09:40.433 --> 09:41.267
Danny and I--

09:41.267 --> 09:42.533
- Amber, smile!

09:42.533 --> 09:44.100
You don't wanna hop
in there with them?

09:44.100 --> 09:48.733
- No, I mean, I don't want
to intrude on that tradition.

09:48.733 --> 09:50.833
They've done that every year?

09:50.833 --> 09:52.667
- You see, you see,
you understand.

09:52.667 --> 09:53.967
It's the tradition.

09:53.967 --> 09:57.067
It's the little rituals
that everybody does

09:57.067 --> 09:58.633
that makes Christmas.

09:58.633 --> 10:02.000
(Julie sobbing)

10:02.000 --> 10:04.500
And they're not gonna be here.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.867
- Oh well, Kayne will be here.

10:09.867 --> 10:10.700
- And you!

10:12.367 --> 10:13.200
- Julie?

10:13.200 --> 10:15.467
- Thank God I have you!

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
Kayne, just one with the girls.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.633
- Get lost.
- Get out!

10:22.633 --> 10:25.400
(dramatic music)

10:30.800 --> 10:31.733
- Okay.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.600
- It's music and lights, Dad.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.500
- It's something else, isn't it?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.800
- Because it's not just
Christmas lights anymore,

10:37.800 --> 10:38.933
it's a Christmas show.

10:38.933 --> 10:40.400
- Hm, it's very clever.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.833
- We can get the
software from the states.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.767
It syncs up the
music to the lights.

10:44.767 --> 10:45.833
- Let's do it.

10:45.833 --> 10:47.333
- Yes!

10:47.333 --> 10:49.267
- It's funny, I feel a bit
emotional after watching that.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.733
- Imagine how people
on the street will feel

10:50.733 --> 10:52.433
when they see our giant snowman,

10:52.433 --> 10:53.700
flashing to music?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.633
- Probably need to be
careful how we say that

10:55.633 --> 10:57.300
in front of the
neighborhood kids.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.700
- Fresh from the oven!

10:59.800 --> 11:00.833
Here we go!

11:02.300 --> 11:04.067
Is that Miss Ogilvy's present?

11:04.067 --> 11:05.067
- Yeah, sorry.

11:05.067 --> 11:06.333
I haven't given it to her yet.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.367
- Yet?

11:07.367 --> 11:08.400
School's broken up.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.067
- Yeah?

11:10.067 --> 11:12.333
- Did you stop feeling
the same way, or?

11:12.333 --> 11:14.733
Well, why didn't
you give it to her?

11:14.733 --> 11:18.467
- It's just, it wasn't the
present I would've chosen.

11:18.467 --> 11:21.233
- Hazlenut dukkah is
a very sophisticated

11:21.233 --> 11:22.200
dipping dish, Oscar.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.733
- I know, I'm sorry Dad.

11:23.733 --> 11:26.700
It was just a teacher present,

11:26.700 --> 11:28.567
not a special present
like I'd wanted.

11:28.567 --> 11:29.733
- Yeah, okay.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.300
Look, I understand.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.500
How about this?

11:32.500 --> 11:34.533
How about we both go
and choose another gift,

11:34.533 --> 11:35.767
a more special one,

11:35.767 --> 11:38.067
and send it to Miss
Ogilvy via the school?

11:38.067 --> 11:40.500
- Maybe we can get one of
those tops that you bought Mum.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.067
- What tops?

11:42.067 --> 11:44.167
- You know, with the lace and
the straps, and the leather?

11:44.167 --> 11:46.233
- No, no, no!

11:46.233 --> 11:49.067
I didn't buy that for your Mom.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.100
That was a part of
a different outfit

11:51.100 --> 11:53.733
that was part of
a costume party.

11:53.733 --> 11:56.333
It came with a really
big, wooly jacket.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.667
Look, me buying a
present for your mom

11:57.667 --> 11:58.833
is completely different

11:58.833 --> 12:00.700
to you buying a present
for Miss Ogilvy.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.600
She's your teacher, mate.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.833
- Student teacher.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.767
- Let's focus on
the teacher part.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.700
Listen, we're gonna
find the perfect gift

12:10.700 --> 12:13.067
for a student
teacher, all right?

12:13.067 --> 12:15.633
- Can we go to the costume
shop that you bought Mom's top?

12:15.633 --> 12:17.100
- No, we can't.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.833
(pleasant music)

12:21.167 --> 12:23.400
- We weren't expecting
you tonight, Mum.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.367
- No, we weren't.

12:24.367 --> 12:25.567
- Don't mind me.

12:25.567 --> 12:27.267
- [Danny] Tried
that, doesn't work.

12:27.267 --> 12:28.733
- I just wanted the
children to have time

12:28.733 --> 12:30.600
to go over their gifts.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.067
- Side table, Royal
Doulton dinner set,

12:33.067 --> 12:34.267
King George lamp.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.433
What is this Nanny Margaret?

12:35.433 --> 12:38.133
- It's all my
belongings, itemized.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.900
You and Oscar tick
which ones you'd like,

12:40.900 --> 12:42.400
and I can put stickers on them

12:42.400 --> 12:44.100
for when you get
back from New York.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.533
- Why?

12:45.533 --> 12:47.967
- In case I'm no longer here.

12:47.967 --> 12:48.933
- Mum!

12:48.933 --> 12:50.400
- Will you be in Adelaide?

12:50.400 --> 12:51.467
Won't you want your
things when you get back?

12:51.467 --> 12:52.833
- I'm not going to Adelaide.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.800
Derek and June don't
really have room

12:54.800 --> 12:56.867
with all their
grandchildren this year.

12:56.867 --> 12:59.067
- That is completely not true!

12:59.067 --> 13:01.067
Auntie June is
desperate for you to go!

13:01.067 --> 13:02.867
- She's just being polite.

13:02.867 --> 13:05.567
I can sense when
I'm being a burden.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.367
- Sensing anything right now?

13:07.367 --> 13:09.067
- But what will you
do on Christmas Day?

13:09.067 --> 13:11.433
- Oh, I'll heat up an old
pie from Thomas Stark's

13:11.433 --> 13:13.400
and have an early
night round five.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.333
(Bess sighs)

13:14.333 --> 13:15.533
- You should come with us!

13:15.533 --> 13:16.900
(glass tinkles)
- Ow, ow!

13:16.900 --> 13:18.067
- What?

13:18.067 --> 13:19.233
To New York?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.433
- Yes, to New York,
you should come.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.867
- Yeah, you should
come, Nanny Margaret!

13:21.867 --> 13:23.067
- She can't.
- No, she can't.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.267
- It's completely organized.

13:24.267 --> 13:26.067
- Oh yes, they're
right my darlings.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.500
It's all organized, and there'd
be so much to think about,

13:28.500 --> 13:31.967
and I don't even know if
my passport is still valid.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.067
Oh no, it is!

13:33.067 --> 13:34.367
Look at that!

13:34.367 --> 13:35.867
(Margaret chuckles)

13:35.867 --> 13:37.333
Perhaps I should come.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.367
- I can check if there are
any more seats on our flight.

13:39.367 --> 13:40.200
- There are.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.167
I would imagine.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.900
(pleasant music)

13:51.133 --> 13:52.833
- We wanted to leave them
under the tree at home,

13:52.833 --> 13:55.167
but every time we tried,
Mum burst into tears.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.733
- No, no, this is good.

13:56.733 --> 13:59.067
I can give you your
presents now, too.

13:59.067 --> 14:02.300
- Let me guess, it's a goat
and three chickens in Somalia.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.400
- No, I got the
message loud and clear

14:04.400 --> 14:05.667
that you didn't appreciate

14:05.667 --> 14:06.900
your charity gift
last year, Amber.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.800
- My charity gift?

14:07.800 --> 14:09.067
How is it mine?

14:09.067 --> 14:10.967
You give the present,
someone else gets it.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.833
- As if you'd want a
chicken or a goat, Amber.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.067
- Yeah, the point is to
give it on behalf of you.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.533
- On behalf of me?

14:16.533 --> 14:19.633
Get fucked, I'm quite capable
of giving to charity myself.

14:19.633 --> 14:21.067
- No, you're not!

14:21.067 --> 14:23.700
- Anyway, this year
you'll be pleased to know

14:23.700 --> 14:26.133
that I got you a coffee machine.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.867
- Really, the capsule one?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.467
The George Clooney
one, not the older one?

14:29.467 --> 14:32.067
- No, the one that you
emailed asking me to get you.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.767
- Where's your tree?

14:36.767 --> 14:38.600
Hasn't Danny found
the right eco windmill

14:38.600 --> 14:40.467
granny farmed forest
to get it yet?

14:40.467 --> 14:41.967
- Where are your decorations?

14:41.967 --> 14:43.400
Did you lose 'em in the move?

14:43.400 --> 14:44.867
- What's going on?

14:44.867 --> 14:47.833
- Why does this house look
like a funeral parlor?

14:47.833 --> 14:49.433
- We're not gonna be here.

14:49.433 --> 14:51.200
We're going to New York.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.600
- What are you talking about?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.200
- New York, New York?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.667
- It's a wonderful town.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.667
- What do you mean you're
gonna be in New York?

14:57.667 --> 14:59.467
You mean for New Year's,
you mean in January.

14:59.467 --> 15:00.767
- I mean for Christmas.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.300
- Why?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.667
- Because Danny and I want to
take the children to New York.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.200
- Well, bad fuckin'
luck, you can't!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.700
You have to stay here with Mum.

15:07.700 --> 15:08.933
- No I don't.

15:08.933 --> 15:10.767
- You've seen the way
Mom's been behaving!

15:10.767 --> 15:11.733
- Exactly!

15:11.733 --> 15:13.733
And I've got two of them!

15:13.733 --> 15:17.067
Ever since we all reunited,
I have had two mothers

15:17.067 --> 15:18.800
fighting over who gets
to see me the most.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.267
Last year, we had Christmas
Eve drinks at yours,

15:22.267 --> 15:23.933
Christmas Day breakfast
with Margaret,

15:23.933 --> 15:25.400
Christmas Day lunch
at yours again,

15:25.400 --> 15:27.067
eggnog supper with Margaret,

15:27.067 --> 15:29.400
and then Boxing Day
picnic with everyone,

15:29.400 --> 15:31.200
and they both still complained

15:31.200 --> 15:33.067
that they didn't get
to see me enough.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.267
It's too much!

15:35.100 --> 15:36.767
We're going to New York.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.733
(upbeat music)

15:39.733 --> 15:40.733
- All right.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.067
- This is it, Dad.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.200
- Hey, a scented
candle, hand cream.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.467
Perfect gift.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.867
Just can't believe she
gave you her address.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.567
(doorbell rings)

15:51.567 --> 15:52.833
Oscar, what?

15:52.833 --> 15:54.867
She did give you the
address, didn't she?

15:54.867 --> 15:56.867
- Not exactly.
- What?

15:58.300 --> 16:00.200
- Well, Caspian and I have
Mr. Mitchell's password

16:00.200 --> 16:01.367
for the staff entry at school

16:01.367 --> 16:03.067
from when he passed out at camp,

16:03.067 --> 16:04.233
and I logged in--

16:04.233 --> 16:06.367
- Oscar, that's illegal.

16:06.367 --> 16:07.500
- Only a little bit!

16:07.500 --> 16:08.433
- We could get
arrested for stalking.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.200
Okay, we have go to immediately.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.133
Hello!

16:12.067 --> 16:14.533
We're looking for Davros?

16:14.533 --> 16:15.900
- Sorry, who?

16:17.400 --> 16:19.100
Oscar, hi!

16:20.233 --> 16:21.767
- Do you know each other?

16:21.767 --> 16:25.567
- I just did my teacher's
placement at Oscar's school.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.733
How are you?

16:26.733 --> 16:28.267
- Good.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.700
- This is so freaky.

16:30.733 --> 16:32.333
I'm Katie Ogilvy.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.867
- Danny Bright, Oscar's dad.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.600
- You must be so proud.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.900
- Mm.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.867
- Who did you say that
you were looking for?

16:40.867 --> 16:43.267
- He said Davros, like
from "Doctor Who."

16:43.267 --> 16:45.600
- But a different
Davros, obviously.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.533
This Davros is
tall, with a beard?

16:48.533 --> 16:51.800
- Oh, I think he
lives two doors down.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.133
Does he have tats?

16:53.133 --> 16:54.267
- Does he have tats?

16:54.267 --> 16:55.700
- I don't know.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.100
- Yes he does, and he
knows that Davros has tats.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.200
- I think he's in 15B.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.300
Yeah, he's pretty noisy.

17:02.300 --> 17:03.267
- Is he?

17:03.267 --> 17:04.800
That sounds like our Davros.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.400
Yeah, noisy old Davros.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.300
He should be careful or they
might exterminate his lease.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.467
- Sorry, is that a
"Doctor Who" thing?

17:12.467 --> 17:13.667
I don't watch it.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.267
- Anyway, we should
drop this off to Davros.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.900
- It's so nice to
see you, Oscar.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.200
And merry Christmas!

17:23.200 --> 17:24.067
- Bye.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.267
15B, Davros.

17:43.933 --> 17:45.367
(doorbell rings)

17:45.367 --> 17:46.200
Oscar, what?

17:49.633 --> 17:50.633
Merry Christmas.

17:50.633 --> 17:52.233
- Dad!

17:52.233 --> 17:53.467
It's actually not
for you, Davros.

17:53.467 --> 17:56.100
It's for Miss
Ogilvy, two doors up.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.600
- Who?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.533
My name's Jason.

17:58.533 --> 17:59.500
- Please give it to Miss Ogilvy.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.667
- Oscar, enough.

18:00.667 --> 18:01.800
- He can say it's from him.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.200
I just want her to have it.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.200
(Danny sighs)

18:05.200 --> 18:06.800
- Would you mind
seeing that this gets

18:06.800 --> 18:08.700
to Miss Ogilvy, from you?

18:09.700 --> 18:10.533
- Sure, man.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.433
(upbeat music)

18:40.567 --> 18:42.633
- [Santa] Ho ho ho ho.

18:42.633 --> 18:44.833
(people chattering)

18:44.833 --> 18:48.333
(hip hop Christmas music)

19:00.567 --> 19:03.067
- They must have got
the software too!

19:03.067 --> 19:04.467
- They've got a bigger crowd.

19:04.467 --> 19:05.967
We need to up the ante.

19:05.967 --> 19:07.800
- Their song sounds cool, Dad.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.700
I'm not sure the
crazy polka's right.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.400
- The crazy polka is perfect!

19:11.400 --> 19:13.567
It's not about the music.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.667
There's an element
that's missing.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.400
- What, just Amber!

19:17.400 --> 19:19.167
- You need to find a girlfriend.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.800
- When?
- Now!

19:20.800 --> 19:22.767
- Is there a girl you like?

19:22.767 --> 19:23.967
- Come on, Kayne!

19:23.967 --> 19:25.500
- Maybe I like the
girl at the 7-Eleven.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.367
Sometimes I find myself going
and buying a banana in there,

19:28.367 --> 19:29.833
which makes me think I like her

19:29.833 --> 19:31.367
because bananas aren't
that nice at the 7-Eleven.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.500
- You need to ask her
out before Christmas.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.933
- So you can go to
her house for lunch.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.167
- But I don't know
if she likes me,

19:36.167 --> 19:37.300
and also I think
she's from India.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.567
Do they celebrate Christmas?

19:38.567 --> 19:39.867
- Who doesn't
celebrate Christmas?

19:39.867 --> 19:41.467
- I don't want to
go to her house!

19:41.467 --> 19:43.200
I wanna be with Mom and Dad.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.567
- We're sending Mom and Dad
to Thailand for Christmas,

19:45.567 --> 19:47.800
because Auntie Susan and Uncle
Keith are gonna be there,

19:47.800 --> 19:49.700
and we can't afford to
pay for you to go too.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.967
- Thailand, why?

19:50.967 --> 19:53.167
- Because her sister
is going to be there!

19:53.167 --> 19:54.200
- What about Bess?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.300
- Bess is going to New York.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.400
- What?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.600
- She's going to New York.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.100
- Huh?

19:59.100 --> 20:00.933
- [Both] Bess is going to
New York for Christmas!

20:00.933 --> 20:02.700
(electricity crackling)

20:02.700 --> 20:04.333
- Dad, they've shorted!

20:04.333 --> 20:06.033
- Come on, this
buys us some time.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.433
- [Julie] What did you say
about Bess going to New York?

20:11.433 --> 20:15.667
* Silent night

20:15.667 --> 20:18.100
* Holy night

20:19.833 --> 20:21.600
- When were you gonna tell me?

20:21.600 --> 20:22.800
- Julie, hi.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.467
- Or were you just
gonna send a postcard

20:25.467 --> 20:28.200
from the Statue of Liberty
with some tinsel in your hair

20:28.200 --> 20:30.900
and let me work it out?
- Julie, I'm so sorry.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.167
I kept trying to tell you,

20:32.167 --> 20:34.400
but you were already so
upset I didn't know how.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.500
- Yeah, because you
knew it was wrong!

20:36.500 --> 20:38.367
- Wrong, no!

20:38.367 --> 20:41.533
- [Margaret] Bess,
Bess you upstairs?

20:41.533 --> 20:43.067
- Oh this'll be good.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.633
If you think I've cracked
up, wait 'til she finds out.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.967
- Which jacket do you
think for Christmas dinner?

20:46.967 --> 20:51.833
I think they're both
lovely, but oh, hello Julie.

20:51.833 --> 20:52.967
- You're taking her with you?

20:52.967 --> 20:53.933
- Yes!

20:53.933 --> 20:55.933
- No, I didn't ask her to come.

20:55.933 --> 20:57.500
She booked her own ticket.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.933
- You'll all be together on
the other side of the world?

20:58.933 --> 21:00.533
- Is there something
you'd like me

21:00.533 --> 21:02.367
to pick up at Bloomingdale's?
- You have chosen her over me?

21:02.367 --> 21:04.300
- I haven't chosen anyone!

21:04.300 --> 21:06.767
I didn't want Margaret
to come to New York.

21:06.767 --> 21:07.867
- At first.
- At all!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.133
The point of going to New York

21:09.133 --> 21:10.833
was that I didn't have
to choose one of you.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.833
I am so tired of you
both making me choose!

21:13.833 --> 21:15.233
- [Both] How do we
make you choose?

21:15.233 --> 21:16.233
- I asked you first.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.167
- Oh my god!

21:17.167 --> 21:19.067
I'm like a Christmas bonbon.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.067
Tug at me long enough, and
a pair of mini binoculars

21:21.067 --> 21:22.367
will come flying out of my ass.

21:22.367 --> 21:23.833
- Bess!

21:23.833 --> 21:24.767
- Where do you get bonbons
with mini binoculars?

21:24.767 --> 21:26.300
- I am not doing this anymore.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.067
- I just want you
to be here, Bess.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.600
Christmas is when we
should all be together.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.900
We have so many
family traditions.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.633
- They are not my traditions.

21:33.633 --> 21:35.867
We have only known each
other for two years.

21:35.867 --> 21:37.567
You can't suddenly
dictate where I'll be,

21:37.567 --> 21:38.967
and what I'll be doing.

21:38.967 --> 21:39.967
I'm sorry.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.700
But I'm going to New York.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.233
- I'm sorry too, Julie.

21:44.233 --> 21:45.767
- You're not coming, Mum.

21:45.767 --> 21:48.300
(upbeat music)

21:52.933 --> 21:56.133
(plane engine roaring)

21:59.100 --> 22:00.400
- Any luck?

22:00.400 --> 22:02.833
- Neither of them are
answering my calls.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.067
I hope the plane goes down.

22:05.067 --> 22:06.900
That'll teach them
not to speak to me.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.700
That's a figure of speech.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.200
- It's actually not.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.067
- They'll come round, okay?

22:13.067 --> 22:14.567
Julie will get used
to the downsizing,

22:14.567 --> 22:16.633
and Margaret will be
fine with June and Derek,

22:16.633 --> 22:18.767
once Derek gets a couple
of drinks into him.

22:18.767 --> 22:19.633
- I know.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.433
- Okay, I'm gonna
regret asking you this,

22:22.433 --> 22:24.533
but are you sure
you still wanna go?

22:25.500 --> 22:26.833
- Both of them not talking to me

22:26.833 --> 22:29.233
is proof that I am
doing the right thing.

22:29.233 --> 22:30.367
- Yes!

22:30.367 --> 22:31.600
(Bess laughs)

22:31.600 --> 22:32.867
- Happy Christmas
Eve, my babies.

22:35.533 --> 22:37.133
- What's up, buddy?

22:37.133 --> 22:38.800
- She's met someone.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.100
- Who's met someone?

22:40.100 --> 22:41.200
- Miss Ogilvy.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.600
She just posted it on Facebook.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.800
Christmas dreams can come true.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.067
- [Danny] Davros!

22:47.067 --> 22:48.300
- Jason.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.500
- I told you it
was a good present.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.600
Ah mate, come here, come here.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.400
Hup.

22:56.067 --> 22:58.333
Look, I know it's
hard to believe now,

22:58.333 --> 23:00.567
but you'll meet
another Miss Ogilvy.

23:00.567 --> 23:01.900
One that you don't
have to call miss,

23:01.900 --> 23:04.233
'cause she'll be your own age.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.967
- There is this really
pretty girl in year 12.

23:07.967 --> 23:09.067
- Yep, that's a start.

23:12.067 --> 23:13.200
- You ready to cheer Mum up?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.567
- If this doesn't, nothing will.

23:15.567 --> 23:20.567
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

23:25.367 --> 23:27.900
(people squealing)

23:27.900 --> 23:28.900
- This is Brianna.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.567
- Hi!
- Oh my god!

23:30.567 --> 23:33.167
(upbeat music)

23:41.167 --> 23:43.433
- Yeah, oh, you like that?

23:43.433 --> 23:46.100
(both laughing)

23:57.100 --> 23:58.567
- White Christmas.

24:00.067 --> 24:01.100
You excited?

24:01.100 --> 24:03.933
(people cheering)

24:08.900 --> 24:10.400
- Merry Christmas!

24:12.800 --> 24:14.467
- Beautiful, baby!

24:14.467 --> 24:17.300
(people cheering)

24:19.067 --> 24:21.867
(people clapping)

24:27.333 --> 24:28.500
Love you guys!

24:31.100 --> 24:33.833
(crowd cheering)

24:38.700 --> 24:39.533
- Rudolph!

24:40.467 --> 24:41.967
- Wayne, stop him!

24:41.967 --> 24:44.067
- Rudolph, settle down.
- Wayne, stop him!

24:44.067 --> 24:45.633
- Rudolph!
- No!

24:45.633 --> 24:48.133
(body crashing)

24:48.133 --> 24:49.400
- Kayne!

24:49.400 --> 24:50.233
Kayne!

24:51.133 --> 24:53.400
(phone ringing)

24:53.400 --> 24:54.500
- It's Julie!

24:55.833 --> 24:57.067
Hello?

24:57.067 --> 24:59.767
- [Announcer] Melbourne,
getting on flight 452,

24:59.767 --> 25:00.733
please make your way to gate--

25:00.733 --> 25:01.833
- Danny, stop.

25:03.500 --> 25:08.500
(electricity buzzing)
(gentle music)

25:10.300 --> 25:12.467
- Merry Christmas.

25:12.467 --> 25:16.567
* Silent night

25:16.567 --> 25:18.433
* Holy night

25:18.433 --> 25:20.300
- I wish you were
in New York now.

25:21.533 --> 25:23.467
And I wish you
were in Townsville,

25:23.467 --> 25:26.867
and I wish you were in
Mount Gambia, Brianna.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.267
All last week I was
doing everything I could

25:30.267 --> 25:32.200
to make you stay here,

25:32.200 --> 25:34.133
and now all I want
for Christmas is,

25:35.967 --> 25:36.800
sorry.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.233
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

25:42.367 --> 25:43.567
I'm sorry, Bessie.

25:47.733 --> 25:51.233
* Sleep in heavenly peace

25:54.533 --> 25:56.200
- All the tests went very well.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.233
No concussion, and the CT
scans came back all clear.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.567
I think our initial
concerns stemmed

26:00.567 --> 26:02.067
from the amount of
blood on the face,

26:02.067 --> 26:04.133
but that was just due to
the light bulb exploding,

26:04.133 --> 26:07.200
so better use a plastic one
next time, okay Rudolph?

26:07.200 --> 26:10.167
- And, his brain?

26:10.167 --> 26:12.800
- No sign of trauma,
same as it always was.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.367
- So there's some
bad news after all.

26:14.367 --> 26:18.500
- Know that there's been no
impairment at all to the head.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.067
- Did you have a
really good look?

26:20.067 --> 26:22.533
- He will have exactly
the same mental capacity

26:22.533 --> 26:24.067
as he's always had.

26:24.067 --> 26:25.467
- As a five year old.

26:25.467 --> 26:26.900
- She's relieved.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.167
This is her being relieved
that he's all right.

26:28.167 --> 26:29.767
- I'm really, really
sorry everyone.

26:29.767 --> 26:32.067
I got caught up in the applause.

26:32.067 --> 26:33.433
- Mate, you need to
stop apologizing.

26:33.433 --> 26:35.333
The upside is when
the ambos came,

26:35.333 --> 26:36.800
and we had all the drama,

26:36.800 --> 26:38.667
no one was down
at the Caravellos.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.867
Not that that was an upside.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.067
- The tests were all clear,
he's going to be fine!

26:45.067 --> 26:47.067
- Oh thank goodness!

26:47.067 --> 26:50.267
So he can come
downstairs for a while?

26:52.933 --> 26:54.800
- Well, it's Christmas
Day after all.

26:56.267 --> 26:58.267
- Well, I reckon you
got what you wished for.

26:58.267 --> 27:00.067
- My brother to
have a head injury?

27:00.067 --> 27:01.500
- Christmas Day with one family.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.867
- I did.

27:02.867 --> 27:04.300
- Bess!
- Bessie!

27:04.300 --> 27:06.600
- Come and sit here.
- Bess, baby, take a seat.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.200
(upbeat music)

27:16.833 --> 27:18.100
- [Amber] Sorry we're
not at your mom's.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.600
- Me too.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.133
I could be drunk
yelling at my sister

27:21.133 --> 27:22.400
about the government right now.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.833
- I didn't get to
meet your sister.

27:24.833 --> 27:25.900
- Next Christmas.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.100
(phone dings)

27:27.100 --> 27:29.333
- Send all our
love to the family.

27:29.333 --> 27:33.867
PS, we think Brianna is the
petrified girl in the world.

27:33.867 --> 27:34.700
- They think I'm petrified?

27:34.700 --> 27:35.933
That's kind of mean.

27:35.933 --> 27:37.833
- Prettiest, it's
predictive text.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.300
- Totally, that's it.

27:39.300 --> 27:40.800
Mum loves predictive text,
even when it's wrong.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.333
She means prettiest, which
is one million percent true.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.800
- Technically you can't
have one million--

27:46.800 --> 27:47.700
- [Boy] Seriously?

27:49.433 --> 27:51.433
- You're right, it's Christmas.

27:51.433 --> 27:54.300
- It's barbecue
chuck, not turkey,

27:54.300 --> 27:55.800
but you get the idea.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.967
- Dad, imagine if we opened
a barbecue turkey shop!

27:58.967 --> 28:00.833
- A pop-up, just at Christmas.

28:02.067 --> 28:03.967
Listen mate, really
sorry about the fall.

28:03.967 --> 28:05.333
I should've rehearsed.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.700
- Dad, it was my fault.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.333
I got carried away
being Rudolph.

28:08.333 --> 28:09.833
I really wanted to
guide your sleigh.

28:09.833 --> 28:10.900
- It's all good.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.067
We learned our lesson.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.600
- But we're going to try
again next year, aren't we?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.367
- Ah, we'll give it
another crack, for sure.

28:16.367 --> 28:18.067
- Okay, everybody got a drink?

28:18.067 --> 28:20.067
No, no, Oscar, not you.

28:20.067 --> 28:22.500
To our family.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.100
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

28:25.100 --> 28:26.233
- [Santa] Ho ho ho ho!

28:26.233 --> 28:27.667
- There you go.

28:27.667 --> 28:28.933
Yes, welcome.

28:28.933 --> 28:31.700
(all chattering)

28:37.133 --> 28:40.633
(hip hop Christmas music)
