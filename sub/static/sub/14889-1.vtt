13:27.373 --> 13:29.576
...Eva, Magda and Zsa Zsa...

13:31.912 --> 13:35.115
...will continue to be
a thorn in your sideburns.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.953
Balki, I am going
to impress Jennifer.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.055
And if the Gabuggis
think they can stop me

13:42.088 --> 13:44.024
let them try.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.461
’Come on, ladies!’

13:50.063 --> 13:52.098
Take your best shot.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.237
I thought not.

13:58.639 --> 13:59.906
[thud]

14:07.614 --> 14:08.949
Cousin...

14:08.982 --> 14:10.216
...you’re lucky.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.151
That was Magda.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.286
She’s the nicest one.

14:13.319 --> 14:14.921
[instrumental music]

14:19.059 --> 14:20.994
[instrumental music]

14:32.272 --> 14:33.507
So...

14:33.540 --> 14:35.475
...this is Skateland.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.081
Not a professional rink,
but I guess it’ll have to do.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.250
The important thing is raising
money for Big Brothers.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.087
Larry, how did you manage
to get $1,200 in pledges?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.389
Even Grant
couldn’t do that.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.091
I guess some
of us have it

14:51.124 --> 14:54.327
and some
of us don’t.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.163
[imitating Larry]
And some of us can’t
get rid of it.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.303
Jennifer, let’s go
put on our skates.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.412
‐Hi, Grant.
‐Hi, Wheels.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.380
I’ll catch you later.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.415
Cousin...

15:16.482 --> 15:18.351
...this is your
last chance

15:18.384 --> 15:20.353
to tell Jennifer
the truth.

15:20.386 --> 15:23.323
The air is thick
with Gabuggis.

15:27.561 --> 15:29.996
Oh. Another Gabuggi update.

15:31.532 --> 15:34.167
You know, Balki, I’m
beginning to understand

15:34.200 --> 15:38.238
why on Mypos a sheep can
run for public office.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.476
(male announcer)
’The skate‐a‐thon is underway!’

15:43.510 --> 15:45.478
’Good luck, everybody!’

15:45.512 --> 15:48.481
[instrumental music]

15:54.721 --> 15:56.322
’Three hours to go!’

15:56.356 --> 15:58.291
’Hang in there, skaters!’

16:02.495 --> 16:04.497
[music continues]

16:06.366 --> 16:08.334
’We’re in the homestretch!’

16:08.368 --> 16:11.337
[music continues]

16:12.573 --> 16:14.775
’Twenty seconds to go!’

16:14.808 --> 16:16.276
You can do it, Larry!

16:16.309 --> 16:18.078
‐Go, Balki!
‐Go, Larry!

16:18.111 --> 16:19.079
Go, Balki!

16:19.112 --> 16:21.715
Why can’t you ever
cheer for my boyfriend?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.317
Oh, okay. Go, Larry!

16:26.186 --> 16:28.154
Are we moving?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.056
Are we moving?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.326
Three.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.028
Two.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.129
One!

16:36.162 --> 16:38.799
[buzzer buzzing]

16:38.832 --> 16:41.067
I did it. I did it!

16:41.101 --> 16:43.436
I raised more money than Grant.

16:44.805 --> 16:46.439
Larry, you
were wonderful.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.242
Oh, Balki, did you hear that?

16:49.275 --> 16:52.278
Jennifer thinks I’m wonderful.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.815
You were wonderful
too, Balki.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.783
And my heart is pure.

16:59.620 --> 17:00.821
I’m so proud
of you, Larry.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.623
Do you know you
raised the most money?

17:02.656 --> 17:04.057
Did I?

17:04.089 --> 17:06.059
Well...it doesn’t matter

17:06.092 --> 17:09.262
who raised the most money.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.497
I never thought of this
as a competition.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.434
I just welcome
the opportunity

17:14.467 --> 17:16.469
to unselfishly
devote my time

17:16.502 --> 17:19.606
and skating ability
to those in need.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.273
[drumroll]

17:21.307 --> 17:24.344
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

17:24.377 --> 17:28.682
Cunningham hardware has
offered to donate $500

17:28.715 --> 17:31.351
to the Big Brothers
in the name of the person

17:31.384 --> 17:33.787
who can jump the most barrels.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.756
[indistinct chattering]

17:35.789 --> 17:36.857
Well, their
money is safe.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.291
After ten hours,
nobody’s got

17:38.324 --> 17:40.193
the energy
to do that.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.662
I do.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.497
‐You do?
‐Sure.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.132
I’ll give it a shot.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.369
This is exciting.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.436
Jennifer, let’s
go over there

17:50.470 --> 17:51.805
where I can get
a better picture.

17:53.674 --> 17:56.109
No. This can’t
be happening.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.143
The skate‐a‐thon is over.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.813
I won, and they’re
taking a picture of Grant?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.616
[intense music]

18:02.649 --> 18:04.518
‐Come on, Grant! You can do it!
‐Come on, Grant! Go, Grant!

18:04.551 --> 18:06.152
‐’Come on!’
‐’You can do it!’

18:06.186 --> 18:08.154
[crowd cheering]

18:08.188 --> 18:11.157
[indistinct chattering]

18:12.192 --> 18:15.161
[music continues]

18:18.298 --> 18:19.533
[crowd cheering]

18:19.566 --> 18:22.503
[crowd clapping]

18:24.170 --> 18:26.139
[clapping continues]

18:27.608 --> 18:28.642
Face it, cousin.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.144
All your lying
was for nothing.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.412
But it’s still
not too late

18:32.445 --> 18:35.148
to save yourself from
the wrath of the Gabuggis

18:35.181 --> 18:36.650
by telling
Jennifer the truth.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.619
[sighs]
Maybe you’re right.

18:39.853 --> 18:40.787
‐Larry.
‐Jennifer.

18:40.821 --> 18:42.556
Did you see Grant fly
over those barrels?

18:42.589 --> 18:45.325
It is the most beautiful
thing I ever saw.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.597
Add another barrel!

18:54.835 --> 18:57.170
Larry, you
jump barrels?

18:57.203 --> 19:00.574
I’m from Wisconsin,
the barrel‐jumping state.

19:02.843 --> 19:05.712
I’m gonna get
Mary Anne’s camera.

19:05.746 --> 19:07.714
Cousin, no, no, no.

19:07.748 --> 19:09.182
I can’t let you do this.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.817
The Gabuggis,
I had a feeling

19:10.851 --> 19:14.220
have been just waiting
to get you over a barrel.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.222
Balki, I can’t
let Grant beat me.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.658
‐Now, get out of my way!
‐No, cousin.

19:17.691 --> 19:19.459
I have to save you.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.827
Oh, my Lord!

19:20.861 --> 19:22.729
‐What?
‐Balki, you were right.

19:22.763 --> 19:24.230
‐I see them.
‐Who?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.899
‐The Gabuggis.
‐Where?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.400
Over there!

19:28.502 --> 19:29.936
[grunts]

19:31.538 --> 19:32.906
[intense music]

19:32.939 --> 19:34.675
‐Go, Larry!
‐Come on, Wheels.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.510
‐’Come on, Wheels.’
‐’You can do it.’

19:36.543 --> 19:37.744
[crowd cheering]

19:37.778 --> 19:40.714
[intense music]

19:47.287 --> 19:50.256
[music continues]

19:53.393 --> 19:55.796
[clanging]

20:02.669 --> 20:05.606
[instrumental music]

20:12.746 --> 20:15.682
[Larry grunting]

20:18.351 --> 20:20.921
[grunting continues]

20:25.291 --> 20:27.393
[sighs]
Larry...

20:27.427 --> 20:29.429
...I’m sure
you’re a good skater

20:29.462 --> 20:33.299
but you were crazy to try
to jump that many barrels.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.802
Jennifer, I have
a confession to make.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.605
Until four days ago

20:38.639 --> 20:41.474
I never skated
before in my life.

20:41.508 --> 20:44.711
And Wisconsin is
actually the dairy state.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.315
And, uh, I’m not
five foot ten.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.820
Boy, when
you come clean

20:53.854 --> 20:55.856
you leave a ring
around the tub.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.628
Why did you
lie to me, Larry?

21:01.662 --> 21:04.665
I was just
jealous of Grant.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.667
Jealous of Grant?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.902
Grant is a happily
married man.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.676
Well, you never
mentioned he was married.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.778
Well, I didn’t think
it was important.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.649
I guess I made a fool
out of myself, Jennifer.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.886
Well, you‐you didn’t...

21:25.919 --> 21:29.322
...except for maybe
the barrel‐jumping thing, but...

21:29.890 --> 21:30.757
[sighs]

21:30.791 --> 21:32.058
...at least you
raised a lot of money

21:32.092 --> 21:34.327
for the Big Brothers.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.596
Thanks for that.

21:38.699 --> 21:40.901
Balki, I had
a wonderful time.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.468
Maybe tomorrow
you can come up

21:42.503 --> 21:44.437
and we can play
roller derby.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.543
I’m counting the moments

21:49.576 --> 21:51.344
my little lamb‐shank.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.783
Well, bye, Larry.

21:56.817 --> 21:57.984
We’ll see you
guys tomorrow.

21:58.018 --> 22:00.386
Oh, yeah. And by then I’ll
have the pictures developed.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.388
And then we can
relive the whole thing.

22:05.025 --> 22:06.760
Oh, good.

22:07.728 --> 22:08.895
[grunts]

22:08.929 --> 22:10.063
Ah!

22:13.166 --> 22:14.668
I never should
have lied, Balki.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.837
‐That is correct.
‐You were right.

22:16.870 --> 22:17.904
That is correct.

22:17.938 --> 22:21.441
When I lie,
something bad happens.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.577
The Gabuggis
make sure of that.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.046
‐Are they still here?
‐No.

22:26.079 --> 22:28.381
They slipped out the moment
you told the truth.

22:28.414 --> 22:29.115
Oh.

22:29.149 --> 22:30.383
They’re probably
on their way

22:30.416 --> 22:32.352
back to Washington.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.824
[theme music]

22:43.630 --> 22:45.398
[theme music]
