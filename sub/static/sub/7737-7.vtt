.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.576
- Previously, on "Colony"...

00:09.043 --> 00:10.311
- Hey!
- Whoa!

00:12.446 --> 00:14.648
- Wait, that--that's Homeland!
- They're not with us.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.052
- You are...
- Maddie.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.521
I'm working for Charlotte.
- My wife has excellent taste.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.623
- I love you.
- Whatever you're going through,

00:22.723 --> 00:26.594
we're going through together.
You can tell me anything.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.196
- Why can't I
go to school anymore?

00:28.296 --> 00:30.531
- Because the government
is giving us a tutor,

00:30.631 --> 00:32.333
and that's gonna be
your new teacher.

00:32.433 --> 00:35.269
- Your son Charlie is alive.
- If you are lying about this--

00:35.369 --> 00:37.605
- I really want to help you
get him back.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.273
[knock at door]

00:39.373 --> 00:41.609
- I need you to let me inside.

00:45.646 --> 00:50.184
- Where's Snyder?
[gunshots]

00:50.284 --> 00:53.254
- Katie fed us bullshit, and
then she helped her husband

00:53.354 --> 00:55.456
take us apart.
She's a double agent.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.495
- We have always known
that we were destined

01:01.595 --> 01:05.533
for...something greater.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.601
Before the Arrival, we were

01:07.701 --> 01:12.140
Jews and Christians, Muslims.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.775
Our beliefs were not invalid.

01:14.875 --> 01:19.447
They were just incomplete.

01:19.547 --> 01:23.117
Each of our faiths promised us
that a great day

01:23.217 --> 01:26.320
of salvation was coming,
and why?

01:26.420 --> 01:30.858
Because we all knew in our souls
that one day our destiny

01:30.958 --> 01:35.129
as a species would be fulfilled
and we would be lifted up

01:35.229 --> 01:41.202
from the tribulations of our
history and become...

01:41.302 --> 01:44.104
something greater.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.508
Today, we have been blessed with
a visit from

01:47.608 --> 01:49.643
brother Nolan Burgess.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.281
- Welcome, brother.
- Welcome.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.184
- He and his friends
in the Political Ministry

01:56.284 --> 01:58.252
understand the importance
of our work.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.554
In particular, brother Burgess
has thanked me

02:00.654 --> 02:04.692
for the dedicated service
of our youth leaders.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.161
Brothers and sisters,
would you please stand.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.230
Please.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.766
We the faithful understand
the critical role

02:12.866 --> 02:16.504
that children will play on the
greatest day,

02:16.604 --> 02:19.707
which is why we must do
everything in our power

02:19.807 --> 02:22.142
to prepare them.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.714
The day shall come.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.418
all: The day shall come.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.865
- Bram and Gracie?

02:44.965 --> 02:48.168
I'm back, and I got apple juice.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.438
Almost didn't get it.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.274
Guy in front of me
got the last one.

02:53.374 --> 02:57.911
But he forgot his ration card,
which was lucky.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.180
Kids?

03:02.283 --> 03:05.286
Is anybody home?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.223

03:13.494 --> 03:15.629

[wood creaking]

04:16.990 --> 04:19.627
[gunshot]

04:22.563 --> 04:25.399
- Are you all right?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.939
Baby, what is it?

04:32.039 --> 04:34.842
- It's nothing.

06:00.894 --> 06:04.532
- Brett, what happened
to the Basquiat I pulled?

06:04.632 --> 06:07.568
It was here yesterday, but
someone erased it from the log,

06:07.668 --> 06:10.037
and...it's not here.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.872
- Maybe someone borrowed it.

06:11.972 --> 06:16.043
- You don't borrow a massive
$12 million piece of art.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.985
- Hey, Bear, have you
seen your brother?

06:26.687 --> 06:31.058
- He left early for school,
Mrs. Bowman.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.894
[hums]
- [laughs]

06:33.994 --> 06:36.497
What's that?
- It's a man.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.099
- Maybe when I get home
we can go to the park.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.669
- Maybe.
[laughs]

06:41.769 --> 06:44.104
- We can all go, Gracie.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.173
- Okay, sure.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.510
- [humming]

06:49.610 --> 06:51.144
- If you need me,
I'll be at the Yonk.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.413
- I'm going to dig
down in this...

06:54.214 --> 06:55.549
- [laughs]

06:55.649 --> 06:57.985
- [murmurs]
- [giggles]

07:01.955 --> 07:05.826
- Do you want to know
who this man really is?

07:05.926 --> 07:09.697
He's someone who is very
misunderstood.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.468
He came here thousands
of years ago

07:14.568 --> 07:16.770
to help us.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.572
- Help us do what?

07:18.672 --> 07:22.810
- Learn about ourselves
and about our universe.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.947
But then the man died,
and for 2,000 years,

07:27.047 --> 07:30.083
lots and lots of people on Earth
have believed that someday

07:30.183 --> 07:32.653
he's going to come back
to save us.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.222
- Do you think
he's gonna come back?

07:35.322 --> 07:39.927
- Yes, just not in the way
that everyone thinks.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.229
But, when it happens,

07:42.329 --> 07:45.065
we'll finally understand
why we're here,

07:45.165 --> 07:48.135
and we'll start over,
brand new,

07:48.235 --> 07:52.773
and that day is going to be
the greatest day ever.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.676
And you're going to be
a big part of it, Gracie.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.514
This...

08:00.614 --> 08:03.016
is a special book.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.886
It has all kinds of
secrets in it.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.722
- Can I read it?
- You can.

08:08.822 --> 08:13.260
- But we have to keep it
just between us, okay?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.028
- Okay.
- Good girl.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.734
- Charlotte?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.504
Charlotte?

10:18.318 --> 10:21.054
No one's available.
Please leave a message.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.056
- This is Amelia Gould.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.625
We need to talk about my house.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.861
I went by your office.
There was no one there.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.933
[radio chatter]

10:34.968 --> 10:37.738
- That's our guy?
- Well, it's his face.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.239
- Dwight Ford.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.641
He enlisted with Homeland
Security nine months ago,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.643
right after they started
taking applications.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.145
- Meaning he's been on
the inside collecting intel.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.014
- What are you doing
to find him?

10:47.114 --> 10:49.382
- Well, it would help
if we could use the Rolodex.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.252
- We need a password.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.122
- I'll have to make some calls,
but I can probably

10:55.222 --> 10:56.423
get you authorized.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.959
- Authorize Jennifer.
She's the expert.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.098
- Find this guy.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.802
- Grab the Homeland file
and...

11:08.902 --> 11:11.671
gimme Dwight Ford's address.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.976
- Whoa!

11:16.076 --> 11:18.812
- Get over here.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.214
Come on!
- Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.

All right, keep your heads up.
Stand by to breach.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.870
Stand by one.
Stand down one!

11:42.970 --> 11:44.905
Stand by to breach.
- Ready? Go!

11:57.050 --> 12:01.755
[men moaning,
indistinct chatter]

12:01.855 --> 12:03.757
- We need a medic to assist!

12:21.341 --> 12:21.741
.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.945
- An explosion, like,
an explosion explosion?

12:25.678 --> 12:26.446
- Not sure
there's another kind.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.415
- Lost four members
of the breach team.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.983
- Jesus.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.819
- Who the hell has C-4
these days?

12:31.919 --> 12:34.321
- Nobody I want to meet.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.488
- Did you find a way
into that machine?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.457
- Snyder just sent the login.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.462

- All right.

12:46.166 --> 12:50.037
[ominous music]

12:50.137 --> 12:52.372

- Let me know what you find.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.992
[background chatter]

13:16.096 --> 13:18.165

- That's us, bro.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.566
- Division Five?

13:19.666 --> 13:21.034
You guys rolled with
Officer Dwight Ford,

13:21.134 --> 13:22.269
also known as D?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.171
- Yeah, we did.
- Tell us about him.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.440
- Not much to tell.
The guy hardly talked, man.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.210
- The guys are saying
he's Resistance?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.413
- Ever see any action with him?
- Yeah, sure. Couple times.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.850
He was always good, clean,
professional.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.852
- Anything that stood out?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.587
- He never showered
in the barracks.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.322
- And you had a problem
with that?

13:42.422 --> 13:43.957
- It was gross, bro.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.860
- What I mean is, one time,
at his locker,

13:46.960 --> 13:50.030
I saw that D had this tattoo
on his chest.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.000
A skull with wings.
- And?

13:53.100 --> 13:56.436
- And I asked him about it, just
trying to make conversation.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.039
- He didn't like you asking.
- He didn't answer.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.976
Just looked at me.
So I never asked again.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.878
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.149
- Skull with wings
is a Force Recon tattoo.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.617
Marine Spec Ops.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.419
- Or maybe he was
drunk in Vegas,

14:12.519 --> 14:14.021
picked that one
out of a sample book.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.957
- Yeah, I'm sure that was it.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.975
- Hey, this area's off limits.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.144
Are you deaf, shit-bird?

is right here.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.691
Every social media page,
credit report, receipt.

15:24.791 --> 15:28.195
That thing can access every
single bit of digital data

15:28.295 --> 15:32.665
that we had on Earth up until
the moment of the Arrival.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.067
What do you want to see first?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.203
- His military background.

15:36.303 --> 15:40.040
- Uh, well, Mr. Ford
was in international sales.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.543
Machine tools.
Traveled a lot for his work.

15:43.643 --> 15:47.147
He was a hobbyist shooter,
trap and skeet, mostly,

15:47.247 --> 15:49.049
and studied some martial arts.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.319
He--he wasn't military, though.
- What did you do?

15:52.419 --> 15:55.322
Before this, I mean. NSA?
Something like that?

15:55.422 --> 15:59.126
- I managed one of the largest
private databases

15:59.226 --> 16:00.960
in the world.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.496
- They keep track of a lot
of trained killers in there?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.332
- [scoffs]
I hope not.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.400
- Then trust me,
these files are bullshit.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.402
Weekend warriors don't
rig their own house with C-4

16:09.502 --> 16:11.104
and they don't sneak
into the Green Zone

16:11.204 --> 16:12.972
and assassinate people.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.108
- Okay, since you obviously
have all the answers,

16:15.208 --> 16:17.210
why don't you just tell me
what you want?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.678
- Use your machine to keep
digging until

16:18.778 --> 16:20.213
you find someone
with a face like this

16:20.313 --> 16:23.150
and a military background.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.001
- Katie wants to meet.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.105
- Good, saves you the trouble
of finding her.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.106
[both grunt]

16:46.206 --> 16:49.109
- She's been an asset.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.079
- In 52 B.C.,
the Gauls decided to revolt

16:52.179 --> 16:54.013
against Roman rule.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.248
They were facing probably
the greatest army

16:55.348 --> 16:56.683
the world has ever known,
commanded by

16:56.783 --> 16:59.186
a ruthless general
named Julius Caesar.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.322
So the odds were obviously
stacked against the Gauls.

17:02.422 --> 17:06.626
But Vercingetorix, their king,
fought a brilliant campaign.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.196
I mean, he basically adopted
a scorched-earth policy,

17:09.296 --> 17:11.698
set fire to his own villages
to cut off the Romans

17:11.798 --> 17:15.068
from needed supplies.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.205
This action caused Caesar
huge logistical problems.

17:18.305 --> 17:21.674
But when it came time to put
his own shiny capital city

17:21.774 --> 17:26.246
to the torch,
Vercingetorix faltered.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.381
He gave in to the pleas
of the town elders,

17:28.481 --> 17:30.750
who couldn't bear to see
their capital city

17:30.850 --> 17:34.121
destroyed.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.389
- How'd that work out
for them?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.591
- Caesar took Avaricum
for his own

17:38.691 --> 17:43.263
and slaughtered
all of its inhabitants.

17:43.363 --> 17:47.100
The graveyards of history are
littered with merciful men.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.702
- As I recall,
Caesar's dead too.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.844
- War is about
making hard choices.

17:57.944 --> 18:03.183
- I understand hard choices.
- Then do the math.

18:03.283 --> 18:08.121
Since Katie joined us,
we've lost our armory,

18:08.221 --> 18:09.822
our chance at Snyder...

18:11.158 --> 18:13.260
And most of our cell.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.628
- She gave us the head
of the Security Wing.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.631
- Yeah, and her husband was
promoted to fill the vacuum.

18:18.731 --> 18:23.102
I mean, maybe we're playing
right into her plans.

since I met you,

19:01.408 --> 19:05.678
I regularly find myself standing
next to awful shit like this?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.880
- It's a common complaint.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.419
- Van was stolen
two weeks ago.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.322
Witnesses to the Snyder ambush
report seeing one like it

19:15.422 --> 19:16.823

19:16.923 --> 19:21.528
Inside is...
what was a black male,

19:21.628 --> 19:22.929
muscular build.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.865
- Any tattoos?

19:25.965 --> 19:28.201
- This fits
the pattern.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.536
The cell is cleaning
house again,

19:29.636 --> 19:32.772
just like they did
with the Gateway bombing.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.774
Check him for a gun.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.876
- Your theory.
You check him for a gun.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.479
- Hell no, man.
I'm eating.

19:52.892 --> 19:57.196
Sig P226.
Standard Redhat issue.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.532

don't go out like punks.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.803
Brother's got some magical
ability to dodge bullets?

20:03.903 --> 20:06.773
A guy he knows walks up to him,
pow, back of the head.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.508
Simple.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.943
- Or that's exactly what our
cell wants us to think.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.246
- Why you gotta be
like this?

20:13.346 --> 20:16.983
We're looking at an engraved
invitation to just walk away.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.619
Why can't you take it, man?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.854

have to finish this.

to stop thinking about you.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.471

21:13.940 --> 21:16.008

come back to my office

21:16.108 --> 21:18.311

with some paperwork?

21:20.747 --> 21:24.050

24:00.907 --> 24:02.475
- Means he isn't just
ex-military.

24:02.575 --> 24:03.943
He was some kind of operator.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.978
Dig into his covers,
try to link them

24:06.078 --> 24:08.447
to news stories
or anything tangible.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.983

to plow through all these.

government jobs.

This is good.

Follow the rabbit hole.
See where it goes.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.133

24:27.233 --> 24:30.002

In private.

24:55.127 --> 24:55.261
.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.664
My father used to bring me
up here.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.966
He was a firefighter.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.869
Man of few words.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.203
We'd sit here
on a hot summer day

25:04.303 --> 25:06.839
and see if
we could spot smoke.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.944
He told me the only thing
in this world you can trust

25:12.044 --> 25:14.647
is yourself.

25:14.747 --> 25:15.948
And then, one day,
when I was 12,

25:16.048 --> 25:17.784
I guess to prove it,

25:17.884 --> 25:20.286
he cleaned out
the family bank account

25:20.386 --> 25:22.655
and disappeared.

25:24.624 --> 25:28.027
I've lived my life
by that rule ever since.

25:31.664 --> 25:34.066

25:35.735 --> 25:38.971
- I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

25:39.071 --> 25:41.240
and I need you to be honest.

25:41.340 --> 25:44.811
- I've always been
honest with you.

25:47.079 --> 25:50.082
- That's not what I heard.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.223
- Is that coming from Quayle?

26:00.827 --> 26:03.029
Let's consider the source.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.064
Quayle's been lying to us
from the beginning

26:05.164 --> 26:08.000
about his relationship
with Geronimo.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.603
All of us, unless
you already knew

26:10.703 --> 26:12.605
that Geronimo was just some

26:12.705 --> 26:15.007

26:15.107 --> 26:18.044

26:20.913 --> 26:25.184
Have you ever given Will
information on our cell?

26:25.284 --> 26:27.119

asking me that

26:27.219 --> 26:29.255
after everything
I have done?

26:29.355 --> 26:33.025
- You killed Vasquez.
- You put me in that situation.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.027
- What else would you do
if someone

26:35.127 --> 26:36.996
put a gun to Will's head?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.798
- I've been clear
from the beginning

26:38.898 --> 26:41.734
that my family
comes first.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.704
- Yeah.

- Everything I have is
on the line right now

26:51.210 --> 26:53.713
because of you.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.148
I came to this cause
because of you,

26:56.248 --> 26:58.117
because I believed
you were the one person

26:58.217 --> 27:02.288
I knew who might be able
to make a difference.

27:10.162 --> 27:13.099
And then you bring me up here,

27:13.199 --> 27:17.103
and you question my loyalty.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.923
- Katie, wait.
Let me take you home.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.358

to Griffith Park,

29:01.107 --> 29:03.742
but...

29:03.843 --> 29:05.878
Quayle thinks
she's a double agent.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.247
I think he's wrong.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.950
- This is a problem.

- Do you believe in him?

29:13.419 --> 29:16.889
- Quayle?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.260
He taught me we can
resist...

29:21.360 --> 29:23.495
that the RAPs may hold
all the cards right now,

29:23.595 --> 29:25.764
but that if we are
smart and resourceful,

29:25.865 --> 29:27.399
then we have a chance.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.905
- What would you have done?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.874
- Quayle would never ask me
to pull the trigger.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.649
- Brett will set you up.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.652
- Charlotte,
I don't understand.

34:46.752 --> 34:51.390
- No, apparently you don't.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.198
You serve at my pleasure.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.133
Whatever I've been
kind enough to give you,

35:01.233 --> 35:03.669
I can take back just
as quickly.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.837
Like the medical care
we're providing for your son.

35:05.937 --> 35:11.277
- I would never to anything to
jeopardize my position with you.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.812
- Well, you did.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.817
- Maddie, what are you
doing here?

35:18.917 --> 35:20.219
- Your wife just threatened
to fire me

35:20.319 --> 35:21.253
and take away my son's insulin.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.155
- Why would she do that?

35:23.255 --> 35:25.123
- I refused to f--- you
so you f--- me instead?

35:25.224 --> 35:26.325
That about right?
- I said nothing.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.460
I know all of this,

35:28.560 --> 35:31.163
it's just a big game
to you people,

35:31.263 --> 35:34.866
but this job, my son,
that is my life.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.303
Do you have any idea what
your wife is involved in?

35:37.403 --> 35:39.905
Because I do,
and I promise you,

35:40.005 --> 35:41.473
it will not improve
your position

35:41.573 --> 35:45.811
in the Political Wing,
so I suggest you fix this.

35:48.514 --> 35:51.817
- Look, Charlotte's reckless.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.421
That used to turn me on,
but I am tired of trying to

35:55.521 --> 35:59.658
convince her that we live in
a totally different world now.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.460
You know, sometimes I wonder
what would happen if

36:01.560 --> 36:02.928
fate took its course,
you know, maybe I'd be

36:03.028 --> 36:05.831
better off if she were forced
to face the consequences

36:05.931 --> 36:07.633
of her actions.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.469
I need a partner who's smart,

36:10.569 --> 36:14.506
capable, and discreet.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.908
Someone I can trust.

36:19.878 --> 36:23.649
- Find anything?
- No. Stop asking.

36:23.749 --> 36:28.654
- What kind of databases did you
manage in the private sector?

36:28.754 --> 36:30.889
- Relationships.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.824
- Criminal profiling,
that sort of thing?

36:32.924 --> 36:37.929
- More like the online dating
sort of thing.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.667
- Wait, what?

36:41.767 --> 36:43.302
You were a matchmaker?

36:43.402 --> 36:46.305
- I oversaw 17 million people
who were looking for

36:46.405 --> 36:49.675
that one other person
in the entire universe

36:49.775 --> 36:51.677
who might understand them.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.712
It taught me everything
I need to know

36:53.812 --> 36:55.947
about the human condition.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.384
- Well, that explains a lot.
- Oh, ha ha ha.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.918
- Yo, got something.
- What?

37:00.018 --> 37:03.221
- How 'bout real, live
physical evidence?

37:04.823 --> 37:07.926
[water splashing]

37:08.026 --> 37:09.628
[door opens]

37:09.728 --> 37:11.563
- Katie?
- Will?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.965
- We need to talk.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.568
- I'm kinda talked out, love.
- Yeah, I know.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.570
But this is important.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.976
The guy that had a gun on you
in the Yonk?

37:25.076 --> 37:27.746
We just found out
he's been in there before.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.448
- What?

37:29.548 --> 37:31.783
- We pulled a set of fresh
prints off the front door.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.385
It matched a bunch of older ones
on the bar

37:33.485 --> 37:34.420
and in the bathroom.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.887
There's a decent chance

37:35.987 --> 37:39.525
that you've at least
seen his face.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.596
Look familiar?

37:50.769 --> 37:52.471
- I don't know.

37:52.571 --> 37:53.872
- Think hard.

37:53.972 --> 37:57.008
He was an ex-government
hit man.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.877
He sold out to
a military contractor.

37:58.977 --> 38:02.381
Now he's a stone-cold killer.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.982
He took out the cell
responsible for

38:04.082 --> 38:05.784
the Santa Monica
Gateway bombing,

38:05.884 --> 38:07.353
just so they wouldn't talk.

38:07.453 --> 38:11.557
Executed Phyllis and her husband
in their own home.

38:11.657 --> 38:15.527
And he almost killed me and you
in the Yonk.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.530
Look at his face.

38:20.666 --> 38:24.570
Anything you can remember
could help.

38:29.575 --> 38:34.045
- I think I may have seen him.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.448
He used to come into the bar.

38:36.548 --> 38:40.719
Talked a few times.
He liked rye.

38:40.819 --> 38:45.857
He, um...I think he lived
at his mother's house

38:45.957 --> 38:47.826
in Hancock Park.

38:47.926 --> 38:52.698
He said he used to like working
on the place.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.966
Does that help?

38:55.066 --> 38:58.036
- Yeah, yeah, I think it does.

39:15.554 --> 39:15.787
.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.456
- Found it.

39:18.156 --> 39:18.957
I cross-indexed all the I.D.s

39:19.658 --> 39:20.392
with credit card payments made

39:21.192 --> 39:22.461
to home improvement stores
in LA.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.062
A few months before the Arrival,

39:24.162 --> 39:26.932
Home Depot delivered
a bunch of building supplies

39:27.032 --> 39:29.100
to that address in Hancock Park.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.770
- Who lived in the house?
- Harriet Broussard.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.972
She died during the Arrival.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.075
She had a son who enlisted
in the Marines.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.677
Force Recon.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.079
And then, he dropped
off the map.

39:41.179 --> 39:44.015
- Name?
- Eric Broussard.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.452
- Nice. We got him.

40:06.838 --> 40:09.007
- Hey. I got your message.

40:10.976 --> 40:14.079
- Did you know Broussard
killed the cell responsible

40:14.179 --> 40:16.948
for the Gateway bombing?

40:17.048 --> 40:18.617
- Yes.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.987
- I thought we were gonna
help them hide.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.956
- Quayle decided they were
too much of a risk.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.993
- Is that what Quayle
decided about me?

40:28.093 --> 40:31.463
That I'm too much of a risk?

40:31.563 --> 40:33.599
- What are you talking about?

40:33.699 --> 40:35.467
- Broussard took me up
to Griffith Park.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.469
Wasn't for the view.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.938
- You're being paranoid.
- Please.

40:40.038 --> 40:44.510
I am inexperienced.
I am not naive.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.917
- Quayle is a pragmatist.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.521
- You?
- No.

40:55.621 --> 40:59.658
But I can't argue
with your instincts.

41:01.026 --> 41:06.231
- I came to them because
I believe in this cause...

41:08.099 --> 41:10.068
And they're just gonna
throw me away.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.503
- Broussard didn't
go through with it.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.138
You're still standing here.

41:13.238 --> 41:16.542
- Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

41:16.642 --> 41:19.878
- A cause needs all sorts
of people, Katie.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.180
It need soldiers like Broussard
who can pull the trigger,

41:22.280 --> 41:24.583
and it needs people like you.

41:24.683 --> 41:28.119
- Why? What purpose do I serve?

41:28.219 --> 41:31.489
Other than spying on my husband?

41:31.590 --> 41:35.927
- Broussard needs you to remind
him why he's fighting.

41:36.027 --> 41:39.931
To keep him away from the edge.

41:40.031 --> 41:43.101
He really does trust you, Katie,
which is incredible,

41:43.201 --> 41:47.539
because that man
doesn't trust anybody.

41:50.776 --> 41:52.243
- I know.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.016
[line ringing]

41:58.116 --> 41:59.551
Come on.

42:06.324 --> 42:09.260
[phone rings]
- Damn it.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.297
[ringing]

42:16.668 --> 42:19.170
Yeah.
- He's coming for you.

42:21.106 --> 42:24.109
[dial tone]

42:26.144 --> 42:29.114
[dramatic music]

43:09.354 --> 43:12.323
[dramatic music]

43:12.423 --> 43:20.365

43:42.420 --> 43:44.222
- Entry is clear.

43:44.322 --> 43:45.791
- Let's go.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.996
- Go, go, go, go!
- I'll check upstairs

43:51.096 --> 43:53.932
[overlapping shouting]

43:55.233 --> 43:57.703
- K-9 unit in back.

43:57.803 --> 44:00.038
[overlapping shouting]

44:00.138 --> 44:02.741
- Bathroom clear!
- Kitchen clear!

44:02.841 --> 44:05.677
- Bedroom one, clear!
- Bedroom two, clear!

44:05.777 --> 44:07.212
- [sighs]

44:11.482 --> 44:12.951
- Hey.

44:13.051 --> 44:15.120
You seen your neighbor today?

44:15.220 --> 44:18.223
- Uh...nope.

44:18.323 --> 44:21.092
I haven't. Sorry.

45:03.869 --> 45:06.838
[intense music]

45:06.938 --> 45:14.880
