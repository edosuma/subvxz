00:21.422 --> 00:24.825
Do I have
a funny story for you guys!

00:24.858 --> 00:27.528
So, I am a...

00:27.561 --> 00:30.098
Huh! I like where this story
is going!

00:37.271 --> 00:40.708
Ugh. Hi, Dad.
So glad you could drop by.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.611
Silence, you ungrateful brat!

00:43.644 --> 00:47.548
Now, bear witness
to the destruction
of your adopted world.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.153
Sorry, Trigon.
We are the Teen Titans.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.155
Our friendship is stronger
than any evil.

00:54.188 --> 00:58.492
And together we have
defeated every menace
that has come our way.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.428
So inspirational.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.596
-Let's do this.
-Titans, go!

01:08.336 --> 01:10.338
Everything hurts.

01:10.371 --> 01:13.841
That dude is tough.
We don't stand a chance.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.444
Hope!

01:16.477 --> 01:19.847
As long as we are still here,
we still have a chance.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.583
And that's why we're
going to keep fighting!

01:22.616 --> 01:24.352
Feeling inspired again!

01:28.256 --> 01:30.158
You're being a baby, Dad.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.601
Why is the Trigon so upset?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.703
I didn't give him anything
for Father's Day.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.873
No wonder he has
destroyed our city!

01:45.906 --> 01:48.442
You damaged his feelings.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.444
Who cares about his feelings?

01:52.646 --> 01:55.649
Excuse me

01:55.683 --> 01:56.884
What do you want?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.852
This is for you.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.254
Oh.

02:04.192 --> 02:08.362
This was very thoughtful.
Thank you.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.265
You know what?
I won't destroy Earth
after all.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.203
Wow. Got rid of him.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.253
Okay, Titans. We need
to get back in the fight.

02:32.286 --> 02:36.257
We're obviously near
the Earth's core.
What's our exit strategy?

02:36.290 --> 02:37.658
Fly us out of here, bro.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.330
-I can't, my thrusters broke.

02:42.363 --> 02:46.667
-We'll be trapped forever!
It's hopeless!

02:46.700 --> 02:50.671
No, when all seems lost,
you must hold on
to three things!

02:50.704 --> 02:53.974
Friendship! Together we will
overcome these odds.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.346
Courage! We must face
what stands before us,
no matter the danger.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.648
And most important, heart!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.417
Stay together.
Believe in yourselves.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.953
And we will emerge victorious!

03:05.986 --> 03:07.455
Titans, go!

03:08.656 --> 03:12.526
Oh, my gosh, dude!
I'm so inspired right now.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.330
My heart just grew wings!
Bro, let's go!

03:24.605 --> 03:25.973
Hello, hello!

03:26.006 --> 03:28.008
Back so soon?

03:28.041 --> 03:31.445
Let me guess. You're here
to convince me to embrace
my inner demon.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.913
Actually, I'm here
to see your friend.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.815
Me?

03:34.848 --> 03:37.285
I just wanted to drop off
a little gift for being
so thoughtful.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.521
Kitty!

03:44.325 --> 03:46.494
Aw, he is the perfect!

03:46.527 --> 03:49.363
I was going
to devour his soul,

03:49.397 --> 03:51.432
but I thought you'd
enjoy him more.

03:51.465 --> 03:55.436
Oh, I am so glad he did not
devour your soul.

03:55.469 --> 03:59.307
Okay, thanks, Dad. Good-bye.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.809
I have feelings,
you know.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.053
Mr. Trigon?

04:13.086 --> 04:16.857
I was just going to have
a silly dance party
by myself, but...

04:16.890 --> 04:19.627
Would you like to do
the silly dance, too?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.529
Would I!

04:30.538 --> 04:33.307
Well, at least he's not
my problem anymore.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.517
I found an exit, Titans.
But move quietly.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.753
This cavern
is extremely unstable.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.522
-Dude, you asked
the impossible!

04:48.556 --> 04:50.824
We're, like,
the loudest guys!

04:52.493 --> 04:54.928
Just leave us, bro.
Save yourself.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.666
Never! I need you
for the final battle
against Trigon.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.469
He has most likely enslaved
most of the planet by now.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.040
Cyborg! Beast Boy!

05:07.074 --> 05:10.344
I would never abandon
those who would stand with me

05:10.378 --> 05:13.046
against the ever-surging
tides of evil.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.548
So inspirational.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.585
My heart just laced up
its dancing shoes, baby!

05:17.618 --> 05:20.020
I would never abandon
those strong enough

05:20.053 --> 05:22.623
to call themselves
Teen Titans!

05:22.656 --> 05:25.393
Now, let me hear you say it.
Who are we?

05:25.426 --> 05:26.694
BOTH:  Teen Titans?

05:26.727 --> 05:29.463
-Again!
-BOTH: Teen Titans!

05:29.497 --> 05:31.432
I can't hear you.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.101
Teen Titans!

05:34.134 --> 05:37.905
-Yes, now follow me!

05:37.938 --> 05:41.341
-Ouch!
My pancreas!

05:44.712 --> 05:46.914
This is Raven
when she was three.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.582
STARFIRE: Oh, precious!

05:48.616 --> 05:51.018
TRIGON: She'd just destroyed
her first universe.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.855
Where did that
little girl go?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.524
Ugh! She grew up

05:56.557 --> 06:00.794
and doesn't like to destroy
universes anymore, Dad.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.897
Oh, and here's
one of us torturing
a demon together.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.933
He was in so much pain.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.503
Oh, good times.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.805
That is adorable.

06:11.839 --> 06:12.940
Is something wrong?

06:12.973 --> 06:16.444
My father never took
the family photos.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.846
Or invited me
to do the torture.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.018
There, there,
Princess.

06:25.052 --> 06:29.457
He may not have been
there for you,
but I'm here now.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.425
-Thank you.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.002
Weird! He's not
your dad, Starfire.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.773
And you're not his daughter.
This has to stop!

06:45.806 --> 06:48.942
Are you upset he's never
given you the kitty?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.844
-No!

06:56.617 --> 07:00.788
-Aw, man. That poor cat!
-This is so sad.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.956
The little dude.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.626
He's doomed, just like us.

07:05.659 --> 07:08.796
-No, this cat
is a symbol of bravery.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.931
He has survived
the perils of this cavern

07:10.964 --> 07:12.800
with only his instincts
to guide him.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.069
All alone. But we have what
this cat does not.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.905
-Thumbs!
-No!

07:17.938 --> 07:19.206
We have each other.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.675
If this cat can survive
by himself,

07:21.709 --> 07:24.077
then, of course,
we will survive!

07:24.111 --> 07:25.679
Together!

07:25.713 --> 07:28.549
Oh, no. I'm starting to feel
inspired again, bro.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.219
Ah! It's like
there's fireworks
going off in my heart.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.822
And together, history
will remember us

07:34.855 --> 07:38.626
as the greatest superheroes
of all time!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.030
Hey, nothing happened.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.666
Yeah, I guess
we're gonna be okay...

07:48.235 --> 07:49.603
Oh!

07:50.303 --> 07:53.173
I hate rocks.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.677
RAVEN: Hey, Butterbean,
want to go to
the candy cane forest?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.512
That sounds delicious.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.014
Hello, hello. I've bought
caramel apples.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.753
I hate caramel apples,
King Jellybean.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.989
They're not for you,
Butterbean,
they're for Sparkleface.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.025
Yum, yum, yum.
They are so good,
King Jellybean.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.861
Om, nom, nom.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.129
Hey! Those apples
are supposed to be mine,
you dumb horse.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.832
Ow!

08:18.866 --> 08:20.668
TRIGON: Play time, Raven?

08:22.035 --> 08:26.139
Am I supposed to be
like the Face Sparkle

08:26.173 --> 08:27.908
If the horseshoe fits.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.645
Now, now, girls.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.014
There has to be
a way to settle this.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.649
There is.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.167
He's just going
to disappoint you.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.136
Like he always disappoints me.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.938
I do not care!

08:57.971 --> 09:01.809
All I want is to be treated
like the father's princess.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.081
Raven!

09:08.115 --> 09:13.587
-I am sorry.
-I'm sorry, too, Starfire.

09:13.621 --> 09:18.959
-I don't know.
I was never mad at you.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.930
I was mad at my dad
this whole time.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.967
Oh, come on!

09:27.000 --> 09:29.236
The fight was
just getting interesting.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.873
You wanted us to fight
this whole time, didn't you?

09:32.906 --> 09:36.009
Oh, see? You lash out
in anger, Raven.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.379
Reminds me you're still
Daddy's little girl.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.182
This is the best
Father's Day gift ever.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.853
Well, if you like that gift,
we have one more for you.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.859
See you
at Thanksgiving!

09:54.061 --> 09:57.030
Sorry, Star. My dad may be
a horrible demon,

09:57.064 --> 09:58.766
but I still want him
to love me.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.635
I, too, wish for
the fatherly love.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.638
Will you be my father, Raven?

10:04.672 --> 10:07.875
-Yes!

10:29.763 --> 10:32.099
Boo-yeah!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.267
I can't believe
we made it, dude.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.903
Yeah, boy!

10:39.172 --> 10:42.743
Yes, together we have
climbed from the depths
of the Earth,

10:42.776 --> 10:44.712
triumphant and stronger
than ever.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.014
Dude, he's being
an inspiration again.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.017
Oh, my heart is riding
a gnarly wave of hope, bro!

10:50.050 --> 10:51.284
Do something.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.855
For we are heroes
of true valor,

10:54.888 --> 10:57.891
strong moral fiber,
and above all...

10:57.925 --> 11:01.294
Dude!

11:01.328 --> 11:03.196
Good job, Beastie.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.832
Yeah, that's what's up.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.834
-Let's never be
inspired again, okay?
-Deal.
