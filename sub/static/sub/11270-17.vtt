00:05.120 --> 00:08.369
I think, if nobody minds,
I'll take my lunch now.

00:08.498 --> 00:09.612
Good.

00:09.749 --> 00:12.453
- Coach, would you mind?
- Here you are, honey.

00:12.584 --> 00:15.917
I've got some lovely roast beef
for a sandwich.

00:17.630 --> 00:21.045
Carla, if it bothers you,
I could eat in the back.

00:21.174 --> 00:24.340
No. I was a little nauseous before,
but I'm fine now.

00:24.469 --> 00:25.251
Great.

00:25.386 --> 00:28.055
You know, I'm starting to feel
a little hungry myself.

00:28.180 --> 00:31.299
Would you mind handing me
my lunch there, Coach?

00:31.433 --> 00:33.472
Thanks. Thank you.

00:37.854 --> 00:40.096
Mind if I join you, Diane?

00:40.231 --> 00:42.270
Not at all.

00:44.485 --> 00:49.560
You know, that's another thing
about pregnancy: you get cravings.

00:49.697 --> 00:51.736
Green olive,

00:52.491 --> 00:54.530
red pimiento,

00:56.244 --> 00:59.244
nice juicy anchovy.

01:03.708 --> 01:06.993
Now, you open
the little anchovy's mouth.

01:09.338 --> 01:13.584
Red pimiento.
Stuff it into the anchovy's mouth.

01:15.885 --> 01:17.260
Sugar.

01:19.596 --> 01:22.596
I think I've just lost my appetite...

01:22.723 --> 01:24.762
for ever.

01:27.227 --> 01:29.266
Works every time.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.830
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

02:52.503 --> 02:56.001
- Beer, Norm?
- That sudsy amber stuff, right?

02:56.131 --> 02:58.704
- Yeah.
- I've heard good things about it.

02:59.842 --> 03:02.463
- How's it going, Norm?
- Don't ask.

03:02.594 --> 03:05.049
It's no fun looking for work, Sammy.

03:05.972 --> 03:08.842
- You going out on interviews?
- Three today.

03:09.975 --> 03:11.932
My resumÃ©, right.

03:12.060 --> 03:15.594
Last guy I show it to reads it,
laughs in my face.

03:15.730 --> 03:18.101
Why would he do something like that?

03:20.108 --> 03:24.057
I'm sorry. It's just that
it's pretty skimpy, isn't it?

03:25.404 --> 03:30.314
You were born, worked at one company,
and you're five foot ten.

03:32.493 --> 03:35.197
What you gotta do
is pep this up a little bit.

03:35.329 --> 03:37.700
- That's cheating.
- That's pepping it up.

03:37.831 --> 03:41.080
Everybody does it.
It's expected of you.

03:41.208 --> 03:44.327
You just take what's here,
just spice it up a bit?

03:46.796 --> 03:51.007
Looky.There's Diane and her date
back from the weekend.

03:53.009 --> 03:56.128
Thanks for dropping me off, Walter.
Bye-bye.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.214
Do you wanna hear me do it
one last time?

04:01.349 --> 04:04.219
No, Walter.
I have to get to work now.

04:04.352 --> 04:05.976
28.

04:07.062 --> 04:10.477
Introduce me to your co-workers.
They'd get a bang out of this.

04:10.607 --> 04:12.599
I don't think...

04:12.733 --> 04:15.983
Hello, Sam.
Walter Franklin, Sam Malone.

04:16.528 --> 04:19.017
- How do you do?
- Ten.

04:19.154 --> 04:23.069
He can tell you instantly how many
letters there are in any sentence.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.362
66.

04:26.661 --> 04:28.902
- That's quite a gift.
- 15.

04:31.373 --> 04:34.326
- We've been at it all weekend.
- How many days was it like?

04:34.459 --> 04:36.451
24.

04:43.383 --> 04:47.047
Listen, Walter,
I have to go to work now.

04:47.177 --> 04:51.304
- Thanks again for a lovely weekend.
- Two sentences. 30 and 28.

04:53.974 --> 04:55.433
- Stop doing that.
- 19.

04:55.559 --> 04:57.432
- I mean it.
- Seven.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.473
That's enough of this.
I'd better get going.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.310
Goodbye, Diane. Nice seeing you, Sam.

05:04.441 --> 05:06.480
- Yeah.
- Four.

05:07.694 --> 05:11.026
- By the way, Walter...
- 14. Yes, Sam. What is it?

05:11.155 --> 05:13.645
How was Diane on a scale of 100?

05:13.782 --> 05:15.110
29.

05:23.748 --> 05:25.787
Quite a catch.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.959
- Thank you.
- So's a largemouth bass.

05:33.089 --> 05:37.002
Walter happens to be
a distinguished geneticist.

05:37.134 --> 05:39.173
He studies genets.

05:40.845 --> 05:42.505
Nice to be back.

05:42.638 --> 05:44.511
OK, Sammy, we're rolling here.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.055
Those job offers
ought to start pouring in now.

05:48.184 --> 05:51.137
"Norm Peterson: thought-provoking,

05:51.270 --> 05:54.436
poignant, hilarious,
a roller coaster of emotions."

05:54.564 --> 05:59.521
"If you hire only one accountant
this year, make it Norm Peterson."

05:59.651 --> 06:00.849
What is this?

06:00.986 --> 06:04.852
He had the paper open
on the movie section, Sam.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.236
Here's the part I like best:

06:08.367 --> 06:12.114
"At last, an accountant
the whole family can go see."

06:13.788 --> 06:16.492
It's no use.
Nobody's gonna hire me anyway.

06:16.623 --> 06:19.196
Hang in there. Something'll turn up.

06:19.334 --> 06:22.951
You ever thought about doing
anything else besides accounting?

06:23.087 --> 06:25.126
I was in the motor pool
in the service.

06:25.255 --> 06:27.294
- I learned about engines.
- Like what?

06:27.423 --> 06:29.463
How to use them for shade.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.833
Let's go and have a look
at these want ads.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.466
Hello, there.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.679
- Did you have a nice weekend?
- I had a wonderful weekend.

06:43.812 --> 06:47.760
Went to Martha's Vineyard,
long walks on the beach,

06:47.898 --> 06:51.942
hiked over the dunes,
crisscrossed the island on bicycles.

06:52.068 --> 06:54.107
Still couldn't lose him?

06:56.071 --> 06:59.072
You now,
you are the last person in the world

06:59.199 --> 07:03.196
who should take shots
at somebody else's choice of dates.

07:03.327 --> 07:06.944
Not with the coterie of Betty Boops
you squander you time,

07:07.080 --> 07:09.831
money and hormones on.

07:10.916 --> 07:15.162
- I date terrific women.
- Yes. And talented.

07:15.295 --> 07:19.458
Without them, the art of gum-snapping
might be lost for ever.

07:19.590 --> 07:23.801
At least my dates don't count
the number of letters in sentences.

07:23.927 --> 07:26.382
Your dates can't form sentences.

07:28.013 --> 07:31.844
OK. You like dating nerds,
nerds it is.

07:31.975 --> 07:35.343
The next time I decide to go out,
I'll check with you first.

07:35.478 --> 07:37.933
That would be a very good idea.

07:39.064 --> 07:41.981
I suppose you know better than I
whom I should date?

07:42.108 --> 07:46.685
I do, lady. I could set you up
with the best date you ever had.

07:46.820 --> 07:50.733
- That's ridiculous.
- I could. Do you want me to?

07:51.407 --> 07:53.399
Would you let me set you up?

07:54.284 --> 07:55.529
Yeah. Why not?

07:59.413 --> 08:02.746
I'm tempted to do this, to see
what kind of a joke you'd bring in.

08:02.874 --> 08:05.993
- I haven't had a laugh for a week.
- Certainly not in a weekend.

08:06.127 --> 08:08.997
- I resent that.
- 11 .

08:14.008 --> 08:18.052
All right, Mr Matchmaker, you're on.
Let's set each other up.

08:18.178 --> 08:20.751
You got it.
You're not gonna pull out on me?

08:20.889 --> 08:24.221
If you go out with mine,
I'll go out with yours.

08:24.350 --> 08:27.932
- Tomorrow night?
- Well, I'll have...

08:29.020 --> 08:32.222
I just thought of the perfect woman.

08:32.356 --> 08:35.972
Yes. Bright, witty, attractive.

08:36.109 --> 08:38.397
Perfect.

08:38.528 --> 08:41.232
- This is great. I can't wait.
- All right. OK.

08:41.363 --> 08:43.402
8.30 tomorrow night?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.239
Two draughts.

08:49.203 --> 08:53.330
Carla, who do I know
who'd be a good match for Diane?

08:54.957 --> 08:58.491
What about that guy you used to
play ball with, Fred Wilson?

08:58.627 --> 09:00.666
Fred's dead, Carla.

09:02.630 --> 09:04.669
So, she has to drive.

09:05.966 --> 09:08.291
I'm serious. Coach, who do you think?

09:08.426 --> 09:11.842
You know, Sam, I always thought
you'd make a great date for Diane.

09:11.971 --> 09:14.010
Coach, that's crazy.

09:16.308 --> 09:18.976
- Or is it?
- Let me think about that.

09:21.562 --> 09:25.606
Of course. That's what she's doing.
That's cute. That is cute.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.898
- Thanks. I have lost a few pounds.
- No.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.695
Don't you see what she's doing?

09:31.820 --> 09:34.606
She's setting me up with herself.

09:34.739 --> 09:37.276
- That little scamp.
- Yeah.

09:37.408 --> 09:42.033
You heard what she said. "Bright,
witty, attractive, the perfect girl."

09:42.161 --> 09:44.486
She's talking about herself.
Who else?

09:44.622 --> 09:47.824
She's not gonna bring another girl
in here tomorrow night.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.875
She wants to go out with me herself.

09:51.002 --> 09:53.243
I kind of like that. Our first date.

09:54.213 --> 09:57.628
Thanks, Coach. lf there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

09:57.757 --> 10:01.540
Sam, by the way,
there is... one little thing.

10:01.677 --> 10:06.801
If you get some time later, could you
tell me what we were talking about?

10:06.931 --> 10:08.758
You bet.

10:08.891 --> 10:10.930
I'm looking forward to it.

10:13.228 --> 10:16.643
I'm feeling like
quite the matchmaker.

10:16.772 --> 10:20.472
I called my friend. She said
she'd love to go out with Sam.

10:22.735 --> 10:28.938
Carla, do you have any idea
who Sam has in store for me?

10:33.702 --> 10:35.113
No.

10:53.677 --> 10:56.249
Sammy,
you're looking pretty sharp tonight.

10:56.387 --> 11:01.593
- What's the occasion there, Sam?
- I've got a very big blind date.

11:02.767 --> 11:06.515
- Isn't that a little risky there?
- Not in this case. Coach.

11:07.521 --> 11:08.931
Sam.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.902
Sammy, watching you
get ready for a date

11:28.037 --> 11:32.248
is like watching a great matador
prepare for a bullfight.

11:32.374 --> 11:36.038
I hate that stuff. Who wants to see
a guy go and manipulate and torment

11:36.169 --> 11:38.291
a poor unthinking creature like that?

11:38.420 --> 11:40.875
I always buy 'em breakfast, don't I?

11:43.007 --> 11:45.545
But looky here. Here comes Diane.

11:45.676 --> 11:48.795
Strangest thing,
she appears to be alone.

11:48.929 --> 11:51.087
Mind if I sit here, Sammy?

11:51.222 --> 11:53.049
Enjoy.

11:56.184 --> 11:57.928
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

11:58.061 --> 11:59.852
Hi, Diane.

11:59.979 --> 12:02.351
Sam, ready for your date?

12:02.481 --> 12:07.438
- I certainly am. Are you for yours?
- As I'll ever be. Is he here?

12:10.946 --> 12:14.860
Kind of a dumb question. Of course
he's here. Present and accounted for.

12:14.991 --> 12:18.490
But wherever
is my date for the evening?

12:20.454 --> 12:24.866
- She went to lock the car.
- She what?

12:24.999 --> 12:28.035
Gretchen went back
to make sure her car was locked.

12:28.168 --> 12:29.876
Gretchen?

12:30.003 --> 12:32.410
The point is,
she is a woman of substance.

12:32.547 --> 12:34.622
She's going to challenge you.

12:34.757 --> 12:36.963
- Gretchen?
- Yes.

12:37.092 --> 12:40.092
Here she is.
Gretchen Darrow, Sam Malone.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.548
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.719
You and Gretchen
have a lot in common.

12:44.848 --> 12:48.548
She's a grad student
working on her thesis in kinesiology.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.307
Small world.

12:52.146 --> 12:55.265
That's the study
of physical movement, Sam.

12:55.398 --> 13:01.151
Akin to athletics.
She also lettered in three sports.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.902
So, you're the Sam Malone
that used to pitch for the Sox?

13:06.032 --> 13:09.316
Yeah, as a matter of fact I am.

13:10.493 --> 13:14.360
Coach, why don't you get
Gretchen here something to drink?

13:14.497 --> 13:15.907
Thanks, Sam.

13:17.708 --> 13:20.494
- I can't believe this.
- I knew you'd like her.

13:20.627 --> 13:22.666
I'm a pretty good judge of people.

13:22.795 --> 13:25.416
So, let's see how you are.

13:25.547 --> 13:27.586
Where's my guy?

13:28.800 --> 13:33.876
Your guy? As a matter of fact,
he's in the poolroom.

13:36.806 --> 13:38.383
Shut up.

13:38.516 --> 13:42.678
I'll just go back and get him
right now. You just hang on here.

13:45.897 --> 13:49.395
He's probably right back here.

14:06.163 --> 14:08.238
Excuse me.

14:08.373 --> 14:10.282
What's your name?

14:10.416 --> 14:12.207
Andy. Why?

14:12.334 --> 14:15.537
- What are you doing tonight, Andy?
- Why do you ask?

14:15.670 --> 14:17.876
No.

14:18.005 --> 14:20.330
I got an extra girl on my hands.

14:20.466 --> 14:21.628
I see.

14:21.758 --> 14:24.961
It's worth $20
if you'll go out with her.

14:25.094 --> 14:27.170
Why give me 20 bucks
to take out a girl?

14:27.304 --> 14:29.593
The 20 bucks is for a little lie.

14:29.723 --> 14:34.016
Pretend we've known each other a long
time and we set this up yesterday.

14:34.143 --> 14:37.309
What d'you say?
My name's Sam, by the way.

14:37.437 --> 14:42.561
I probably know that, don't I?
What if this girl doesn't like me?

14:42.692 --> 14:45.562
That's alright.
She doesn't like anybody.

14:53.409 --> 14:56.113
What are you looking at, endomorph?

15:00.289 --> 15:03.206
Nothing. Nothing, sir.

15:05.293 --> 15:08.578
Andy, I'd like you to meet Diane.
And this is Gretchen.

15:10.380 --> 15:14.080
I finally meet Gretchen.
Sam talks about you all the time.

15:14.217 --> 15:18.130
- Gretchen, Gretchen, Gretchen.
- He just met me.

15:18.262 --> 15:20.752
But I knew
you'd be coming along any day.

15:20.889 --> 15:24.257
No, this is your date,
Diane Chambers.

15:25.267 --> 15:27.840
- Hello.
- How do you do?

15:27.978 --> 15:31.642
Diane, I'd like you to meet
my good buddy Andy... Andy.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.563
Andy Andy.

15:35.692 --> 15:38.230
That should be easy to remember.

15:39.820 --> 15:43.769
- How do you two know each other?
- She asks good questions.

15:43.907 --> 15:46.195
- Good question.
- We met in the pool...

15:46.326 --> 15:51.366
At the Y. We do a lot of swimming,
kicking, all your basic water sports.

15:51.496 --> 15:54.781
Now we're getting into your area
of expertise, aren't we?

15:54.916 --> 15:58.165
Swimming is one of the finest
cardiopulmonary exercises.

15:58.293 --> 16:01.709
It's wonderful for the development
of the major muscle groups,

16:01.838 --> 16:04.293
particularly the <i>latissimus dorsi.</i>

16:04.423 --> 16:07.542
I bet you're kicking yourself
that I got to her first.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.961
We're gonna take off now.
You two have a good time.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.672
You two, too.

16:12.805 --> 16:17.181
Andy Andy and I will have fun fun.

16:18.976 --> 16:23.637
So, what do you think, Andy?
How does ltalian food sound?

16:23.772 --> 16:27.721
I've been hungry
for Italian food all day.

16:27.858 --> 16:30.100
Anywhere but <i>Via Milano.</i>

16:30.235 --> 16:34.232
That's bad memories for me.
I killed a waitress there.

16:40.327 --> 16:43.197
- We'll double.
- Did you hear what he said?

16:49.918 --> 16:52.788
Listen, Coach,
you're not gonna believe this.

16:52.920 --> 16:57.083
- I was just talking to the guys...
- I'd like to believe it, Carla.

16:58.591 --> 17:00.630
No, coach, not that.

17:01.844 --> 17:05.294
You know who that guy
that Sam just set Diane up with is?

17:05.430 --> 17:06.627
Who?

17:06.763 --> 17:11.175
He just got out of the pen after
doing 10 years for manslaughter.

17:15.813 --> 17:20.023
That must be them now. I saw them
taking off on a motorcycle.

17:20.150 --> 17:25.522
Diane had to ride piggyback
on a motorcycle? That's great.

17:25.654 --> 17:29.402
You didn't think we were gonna make
that last jump, did you?

17:38.831 --> 17:42.164
Here we are. Anybody need anything?

17:42.293 --> 17:44.332
A five-minute head start?

17:45.128 --> 17:50.252
Why don't we sit down and pick up
the conversation where we left off?

17:54.636 --> 17:57.589
So, where were we?

18:00.057 --> 18:02.428
Yeah, that was about it.

18:03.226 --> 18:06.096
You ever dream that you have claws?

18:08.188 --> 18:10.679
That's it for me. I've gotta run.

18:10.815 --> 18:12.973
Don't get up. I'm warning you.

18:14.151 --> 18:16.190
Good night, all.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.360
If you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go scrape the bugs off my teeth.

18:32.958 --> 18:37.085
Well, I guess that just about
does it there for you, Andy.

18:38.337 --> 18:41.006
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

18:41.131 --> 18:44.831
- Sam, everything alright?
- Perfect.

18:44.967 --> 18:48.336
Hard to tell. She didn't say much.

18:48.470 --> 18:50.711
Except for that little scream
she let out

18:50.847 --> 18:54.381
when I asked the waiter
for a sharper knife.

18:55.893 --> 18:57.303
Bye.

19:06.151 --> 19:07.479
Is he...?

19:08.444 --> 19:10.483
He's gone. Yeah.

19:17.868 --> 19:19.908
In that case,

19:21.788 --> 19:23.827
let me just say...

19:26.167 --> 19:29.369
of all the cheap, small-minded,

19:29.503 --> 19:33.416
creepy, sophomoric pranks

19:33.548 --> 19:37.212
you have perpetrated
in your long, arrested adolescence,

19:37.342 --> 19:40.508
this is far and away the worst.

19:42.888 --> 19:45.011
How could you, Sam?

19:46.683 --> 19:48.924
So, he wasn't your ideal date.

19:50.519 --> 19:53.188
I'm big enough to admit
when I'm wrong.

19:53.313 --> 19:55.471
Did you really think
this was amusing?

19:55.607 --> 19:57.646
Did you have lots of laughs
planning it?

19:57.775 --> 20:00.526
Diane, I swear,
I wasn't trying to be funny.

20:00.652 --> 20:02.692
What were you trying to do?

20:03.655 --> 20:06.324
The truth is, I never saw the guy
before in my life.

20:06.449 --> 20:11.026
I met him in the back room
and I paid him to go out with you.

20:15.664 --> 20:18.618
You hired a murderer
to take me out for the evening.

20:22.962 --> 20:25.713
It's kind of funny
when you put it that way.

20:28.299 --> 20:33.838
Look, I actually didn't think
that you were gonna get me a girl.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.844
What did you think I'd get you?

20:35.972 --> 20:39.175
I... Well, I guess I...

20:39.308 --> 20:44.514
I thought that you were
talking about us. You and me.

20:45.355 --> 20:52.269
I thought that you thought you were
the ideal date for me and vice versa.

20:55.696 --> 20:56.941
Really?

20:57.948 --> 21:01.281
- You thought that we...?
- I'm embarrassed.

21:01.409 --> 21:03.448
I am so embarrassed.

21:05.871 --> 21:07.910
I understand.

21:10.458 --> 21:13.908
- Poor Sam.
- Thank you so much.

21:15.712 --> 21:19.756
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "Poor Sam"?

21:21.383 --> 21:24.337
I didn't realise you were carrying
such a torch for me.

21:26.137 --> 21:29.671
No. I didn't say
I was carrying a torch for you.

21:29.807 --> 21:32.641
I said I thought you were
carrying a torch for me.

21:33.601 --> 21:36.174
I'm certainly not
carrying a torch for you.

21:36.312 --> 21:39.146
Then I'm not carrying
a torch for you.

21:40.357 --> 21:42.396
Fine.

21:46.069 --> 21:47.480
Sam...

21:50.948 --> 21:56.072
If you'll admit that you are
carrying a little torch for me,

21:58.204 --> 22:01.738
I'll admit that
I'm carrying a little one for you.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.544
I am carrying a little torch for you.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.586
Well, I'm not carrying one for you.

22:20.889 --> 22:24.553
- Then I'm not carrying one for you.
- You just said you were.

22:24.683 --> 22:27.767
I said that only to get you
to admit that you are.

22:27.894 --> 22:29.933
You're making a fool of yourself.

22:30.063 --> 22:32.434
Just admit that
you're hung up on me, dammit.

22:32.565 --> 22:33.940
- I am not.
- You are, too.

22:34.066 --> 22:35.180
I am not!

22:35.317 --> 22:39.148
Please! Do you think
I'd behave like this in your home?

22:42.573 --> 22:44.897
Sorry.

22:45.033 --> 22:47.986
Well, we are being
awfully childish about this.

22:48.119 --> 22:49.150
Maybe.

22:49.286 --> 22:52.904
Let's leave it at this.
I'm rubber and you're glue.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.075
Everything you say bounces off me
and sticks to you.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.162
- You love me.
- I do not.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.749
- Do, too!
- Do not!

23:06.633 --> 23:10.215
That is the most embarrassing display
I have ever seen.

23:11.471 --> 23:15.764
You're absolutely right. Anybody
can see she's crazy about him.

23:15.891 --> 23:18.381
Are you crazy? He's nuts about her.
