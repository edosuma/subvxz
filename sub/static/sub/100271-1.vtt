00:34.208 --> 00:37.211
Where is it?

00:38.864 --> 00:41.954
Where the hell is it?

00:41.998 --> 00:43.956
What are you talking about?

00:45.262 --> 00:46.916
I know you hid them again,
didn'â€™t you?

00:48.744 --> 00:50.093
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.138
Is that what this is?

00:52.008 --> 00:54.793
Give it to me now, or it's gonnaget a lot worse!

00:55.968 --> 00:58.188
Stop it!
We did not hide your shit!

00:58.232 --> 01:00.973
Give it to me! I know you have
got it! Give it to me!

01:02.279 --> 01:03.585
Here!

01:10.461 --> 01:13.377
No, no, no, no, no!
We are not done with this.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.684
We are not done
with this.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.643
We are not done here.
We are not done!

01:18.687 --> 01:20.689
Do not move.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.706
You guys do not love me.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.407
Do not know what you two have
become.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.192
Little brats.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.152
Hiding shit everywhere!

01:55.680 --> 01:56.681
Mom?

02:01.208 --> 02:04.211
911, what is the nature of youremergency?

04:38.103 --> 04:41.106
Let me tell you a few things
that I know.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.807
I know I am not staring into theeyes of angels.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.680
You are not innocent lambs.

04:52.379 --> 04:59.386
You are here because you are theworthless, weak, troublemaking,

04:59.429 --> 05:02.780
unwanted shit-stains in my
pants.

05:02.824 --> 05:07.742
The outside world does not wantyou.

05:07.785 --> 05:11.789
But we do.

05:14.966 --> 05:18.535
The rules here are simple.

05:18.579 --> 05:23.584
One, do exactly what I tell
you to do.

05:25.934 --> 05:30.678
Two, always follow
rule number one.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.946
You see that?

05:37.989 --> 05:39.730
I see it.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.705
Looks like we got
ourselves a little rebel.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.839
Another one.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.985
You got something to say to me?

06:17.028 --> 06:19.770
This is bullshit!

06:24.122 --> 06:26.864
OFFICE HALE>> Whoa!

06:26.908 --> 06:31.086
I think this one is special. Youspecial, boy?

06:31.129 --> 06:32.827
Come on, man. He is just...

06:32.870 --> 06:36.961
He is just what, King?

06:37.005 --> 06:40.008
He is just a stupid kid.

06:44.491 --> 06:49.496
Is that what you are? Just
a stupid kid?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.889
Go to hell!

06:53.978 --> 06:58.505
Show him what happens.
Show him what happens, Payne.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.723
Get his ass up.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.073
I said get up! Get up!

07:02.117 --> 07:03.858
Please, no!

07:06.164 --> 07:09.124
OFFICER PAYNE>> See you alreadybroke rules one and two.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.259
It is called the delousing pool.

08:41.303 --> 08:44.262
It is where we disinfect animalslike you.

08:44.306 --> 08:50.051
You stay in this pool too long,the acid will tear your skin
from the bone.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.317
Probably kill you.

08:55.360 --> 09:01.366
If I were you, I would swim
across as fast as you can.

09:05.588 --> 09:10.680
Look who is up. Come on.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.596
You still feeling froggy.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.380
Go on.

09:15.424 --> 09:15.946
No.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.382
Go ahead. Jump!

09:17.426 --> 09:19.167
No, no.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.393
Come on, up.

09:28.437 --> 09:32.136
Hey, you are going to make it.
Alright?

10:17.529 --> 10:21.272
Oh. Hello.

10:26.582 --> 10:31.326
My name is Anna.
Please have some.

10:37.985 --> 10:41.989
Do you like pie?

10:46.558 --> 10:49.300
What is your name?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.695
Jeremy.

10:55.219 --> 10:59.571
I can see you are scared,
Jeremy. Do not be.

10:59.615 --> 11:04.794
I want you to think of me as a
safe place, ok?

11:04.838 --> 11:07.841
Nowhere is safe.

11:10.626 --> 11:16.763
You have to be strong in here.
That is how we survive.

11:16.806 --> 11:21.593
But you have a mother out therewaiting for you to come home.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.378
No I do not.

11:27.643 --> 11:32.604
Well then let me be your mother,while you are here.

11:32.648 --> 11:36.391
Sometimes pie makes everything
better.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.657
Jeremy, what happened to your
hand?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.528
Hey!

11:43.572 --> 11:46.793
What in the hell are you
doing?

11:46.836 --> 11:49.665
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait!

11:49.709 --> 11:52.799
You do not look at him.
You do not talk to him.

11:52.842 --> 11:56.672
You do not touch him.

11:56.716 --> 12:01.546
You are going to go talk to thewarden, Anna.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.593
Now, Anna!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.727
Good girl.

12:36.843 --> 12:41.978
We have an understanding, you
and I.

12:42.022 --> 12:45.025
Do we not?

12:46.809 --> 12:52.554
You are here to cook. You are
here to clean, nothing more.

12:56.645 --> 13:03.652
Those boys, they need divine
intervention, not a mommy.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.612
You have your own child for
that.

13:09.092 --> 13:12.835
You mean our child?

13:12.879 --> 13:18.841
What if someone were to hear yousay that? Like my wife?

13:18.885 --> 13:20.016
I have not said anything.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.063
And you never will.

13:24.891 --> 13:31.854
You had no money, no future. I
handed you one, right here

13:31.898 --> 13:38.818
so that I could see the child
and you would have a life.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.907
I just want what is best for thechild.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.736
I do not want to be any trouble.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.566
Good girl.

13:48.610 --> 13:54.616
Trouble could only begin with
your mouth.

13:58.925 --> 14:02.885
Are you taking your pills, Anna?

14:02.929 --> 14:07.890
I do not need them anymore. I amnot depressed. I am handling it.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.718
Well that is fantastic.

14:11.328 --> 14:16.899
Because without an education ora job or a purpose,

14:16.943 --> 14:20.381
well you would not be handling
much.

14:20.424 --> 14:28.432
I pulled my own string so thatyou could be here to help raisethat child.

14:28.911 --> 14:33.220
But theres... Something is not
right.

14:33.263 --> 14:38.225
I think they might be takingthings too far with these boys.

14:38.268 --> 14:44.274
You need to call your guard dogsand find out what is going on
here.

14:48.061 --> 14:51.934
It sounds like maybe you cannotfollow my rules either.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.067
Let us go over them again.

14:54.110 --> 15:00.160
You see nothing.
You hear nothing.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.989
You are nothing.

15:03.032 --> 15:07.645
There is this boy Jeremy and hishand is bandaged and bloody
and--

15:09.299 --> 15:12.520
The mouthy one got away.

15:12.563 --> 15:16.741
Put the word out.

15:16.785 --> 15:22.791
Anna, you stay here.
You understand?

17:40.450 --> 17:43.453
Where did you find him?

17:45.064 --> 17:48.806
Behind the gas station.
What's the difference?

17:48.850 --> 17:51.853
Where's my sixty bucks?

17:52.419 --> 17:54.769
You ought to watch your tone.

17:54.812 --> 17:58.816
No, no. The man came straight tothe point.

18:03.430 --> 18:06.389
I am sorry. I did not know you
were already here.

18:06.433 --> 18:10.176
I never miss the return of my
property.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.919
Of course.

18:36.550 --> 18:42.556
When will you boys learn you cannot escape Preston?

18:44.558 --> 18:46.473
I am sorry.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.257
Shhhhhhh

18:51.130 --> 18:54.133
Just do not make me go in thereagain.

18:57.005 --> 19:03.490
I do not want you to worry. Ok?I promise,

19:03.533 --> 19:11.280
you will never have to see the
inside of that awful place
again.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.308
Handle that.

19:53.844 --> 19:59.633
Ok. Ok. Whatever this is, I cannot be a part of it.

19:59.676 --> 20:04.246
I have a little girl to take
care of and I am not doing it
from prison.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.293
This has to stop.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.645
You pick that weapon up right
now.

20:11.688 --> 20:15.083
Not necessary.

20:15.126 --> 20:19.174
No one is going to jail, King.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.656
You should go home and take careof your kid.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.048
What are you doing?

20:24.092 --> 20:27.574
He has been a part of this fromthe beginning,

20:27.617 --> 20:31.491
so who is he going to tell?

20:31.534 --> 20:32.666
No one.

20:32.709 --> 20:36.147
That is right.

20:36.191 --> 20:41.196
Well old chum, I accept your
resignation.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.416
I would like to thank you allfor joining us for the rehearsaldinner

21:27.460 --> 21:31.768
for the two or three of you I
have not met yet,

21:31.812 --> 21:37.818
my wife and I are very happy youcould join us from near and far.

21:37.861 --> 21:43.040
I am very very proud and honoredto welcome Skyler into our
family.

21:43.084 --> 21:46.827
Tomorrow the two of them will bewed.

21:46.870 --> 21:50.831
Skyler, you are such an amazingaddition to the family.

21:50.874 --> 21:53.834
It is with great sadness of
course that your father could

21:53.877 --> 21:58.534
not be with us to see what an
extraordinary bright light you
have become.

21:58.578 --> 22:02.843
He would have been incredibly
proud, your mother as well
who fought till the end.

22:02.886 --> 22:06.890
So I take even greater pride inhaving you as a daughter.

22:06.934 --> 22:13.854
My eldest, Derek...
Good luck, Skyler with...

22:17.814 --> 22:20.077
Nate! Of course. What would an

22:20.121 --> 22:24.386
important occasion be without
you somehow interrupting?

22:24.430 --> 22:28.216
I just wanted to say that I
really need to go to the
bathroom.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.393
What is wrong with your son?

22:31.437 --> 22:33.352
He is an idiot.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.920
Tay lor on the other hand, our
maid of honor, thank you very,
very much

22:36.964 --> 22:38.922
for being a part of the
ceremony.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.969
I love you Skyler.

22:42.012 --> 22:45.973
Your father Steve, Larry and I,over there, we have

22:46.016 --> 22:48.062
worked and supported each otherforever and a day, so-

22:48.105 --> 22:50.978
Alright now hold on a second. Iwant to say something.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.415
To my beautiful daughter Taylor,uh

22:53.459 --> 22:55.983
you two, do not get any ideas
because on our salaries

22:56.026 --> 23:00.379
we cannot afford something likethis.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.990
Who am I forgetting?

23:03.033 --> 23:07.298
My youngest, Sam.
Sam!

23:07.342 --> 23:09.997
I do not have to use the
bathroom.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.999
No, of course not. You do not
have to.

23:12.042 --> 23:18.266
I am just letting you know I donot have to use it. Maybe later.

23:18.309 --> 23:24.185
Alright. Sam is also taking
applications for a hot date.

23:24.228 --> 23:29.495
Well, my wife and I thank you
all for being here. To Skyler
and Derek.

23:31.366 --> 23:34.369
and the future.

23:47.121 --> 23:51.342
Hey, you ok?

23:51.386 --> 23:53.475
Yeah, I am fine.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.345
You do not look fine.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.348
Skyler, I said I am fine.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.960
Derek you know he loves you.

24:00.003 --> 24:03.790
Ok, do not take it personally.
It is just the way he is.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.095
Look at all this.

24:05.139 --> 24:05.966
He just wants us to be happy.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.663
Stop!
Stop.

24:07.707 --> 24:10.492
You cannot fix everything.

24:10.536 --> 24:16.019
Derek, Derek, do you still wantto marry me?

24:16.063 --> 24:22.069
Yes. Yes I still want to marry
you, Skyler.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.158
But he does not want us to be
happy.

24:24.201 --> 24:27.553
He does not give a shit about
me. All he cares about is Sam.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.163
All I have ever done
is disappoint him.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.381
I am never ever going to make
him happy.

24:30.425 --> 24:31.513
You realize that, right?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.036
You make me happy. Is that not
enough?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.516
Skyler, that's not the point.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.518
You need, you always told me
that you need.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.566
I can not do this Skyler.Skyler, I can not do this rightnow.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.405
Had enough of the dancing, eh?

24:54.449 --> 24:58.192
Something like that.

24:58.235 --> 25:01.456
Thank you for all this.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.503
Oh, you are very welcome.

25:06.330 --> 25:10.247
I am counting on you to look
after my son.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.033
He needs you.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.174
You are going to get it woman.

25:24.218 --> 25:27.221
Talk is cheap, baby.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.183
Did you just hear something?

25:33.227 --> 25:35.882
Do not worry, I locked the door.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.927
Ok.

25:40.713 --> 25:43.150
Oh my God!

25:43.193 --> 25:45.587
You are on my sweater.

25:45.631 --> 25:49.330
Sam, what are you doing in our
room?

25:49.373 --> 25:53.334
You are in my room.
There were two keys.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.596
Did you take the wrong key?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.381
I do not know.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.340
Sam, I am so sorry. Could you--

25:59.383 --> 26:00.036
I am starving.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.083
give us uh um...

26:06.782 --> 26:08.305
Well, since we are here

26:08.349 --> 26:10.786
Are you joking?

26:10.830 --> 26:14.311
Apparently.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.033
Ok so I am going to get my hairdone.

26:40.076 --> 26:40.816
Did you have your tux cleaned?

26:40.860 --> 26:41.600
The tux was cleaned.

26:43.514 --> 26:46.082
Sam.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.257
I was hungry.

26:47.301 --> 26:50.304
There is a wrong key for each
room.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.828
Sam, you cannot come into
peoples' rooms like--

26:52.872 --> 26:55.352
Hey, it is ok. It is fine.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.484
How are you, Sam?

26:56.527 --> 26:59.356
This gift basket sucks.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.489
Ok, we will get you more food.

27:01.532 --> 27:06.494
Hey it is good to see you.
College looks good on you.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.365
Ok, I am going to change reallyquickly and um

27:08.409 --> 27:10.411
Ok.

27:12.326 --> 27:16.373
Hey, look at me. If you come
into my room again like that,

27:16.417 --> 27:19.768
I will break your God damned
fingers.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.728
Do not move.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.773
Jesus Christ.

27:26.906 --> 27:30.431
Hey!

27:45.664 --> 27:49.580
So, Sam, I have not seen you ina while.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.060
What do you mean?

27:51.104 --> 27:52.845
I just saw you a few minutes agowithout any clothes on.

27:52.888 --> 27:55.761
Tell her what you do now.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.285
I write software and stuff.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.983
Oh great. I use computers and
stuff.

28:01.027 --> 28:03.594
Code just speaks to me.

28:03.638 --> 28:07.511
You know what speaks to me?
Boobs.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.383
What are you working on now?

28:09.426 --> 28:11.602
It's a thing called Apparition.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.953
Oh yeah? What does it do?

28:13.996 --> 28:17.478
It allows us to connect the
living with the dead.

28:17.521 --> 28:20.786
Jesus Christ, Sam!

28:20.829 --> 28:22.962
What? How does that work?

28:23.005 --> 28:25.921
It uses the home button, GPSand some old school binary codeI have embedded in it.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.053
It does what?

28:27.096 --> 28:29.316
Mysticism, stuff from the dark
web.

28:29.359 --> 28:33.363
A really remote back door led meto this.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.498
What is that?

28:37.541 --> 28:39.369
It's a picture of Elrik.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.720
Oh I love him, I have all of hisalbums.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.634
What did you do now, Sam?

28:43.678 --> 28:46.246
Elrik was a Shaman God who was
the judge and ruler of the
underworld.

28:46.289 --> 28:49.510
This picture dates back to about600 B.C.

28:49.553 --> 28:52.556
And you just.. you just found
it, right?

28:52.600 --> 28:56.125
Someone archived it. But I dug
it up.

28:56.169 --> 28:59.259
They say he enabled believers tocommunicate with spirits.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.870
So maybe it will work the same
way with the app.

29:01.914 --> 29:04.743
Yo,turn that shit on!

29:04.786 --> 29:06.745
Ok.

29:12.489 --> 29:16.363
Once the user thumbs over the
sensor, it will activate or

29:16.406 --> 29:19.888
open a kinetic energy portal
to a spirit in your bloodline.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.934
Really?

29:21.977 --> 29:25.938
In theory it will drop a pin onthe person who wishes to
communicate with you.

29:25.981 --> 29:27.809
What if you turn it off?

29:27.853 --> 29:31.465
Then the connection could be
lost forever.

29:31.508 --> 29:36.513
So the real question is, who hasthe balls to go first?

29:43.216 --> 29:44.783
Mmmm, I got the balls.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.786
Yeah, that's my sexy girl.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.356
Oh what is the worst that can
happen?

29:53.400 --> 29:56.272
APP>> Are you ready to begin?

30:00.711 --> 30:03.714
What the fuck?

30:09.024 --> 30:12.027
Housekeeping.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.856
No, we are good. Thank you.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.858
Ok.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.166
Nothing happened, Sam.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.559
You call that nothing? A blind
person would say that was
something.

30:22.603 --> 30:23.865
APP>>

30:23.909 --> 30:25.127
Oh my God.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.389
Yo Sam, there is no way that
just happened.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.696
I do not know what just
happened.

30:28.739 --> 30:29.305
The address, it is...

30:29.349 --> 30:32.178
It is what?

30:32.221 --> 30:34.049
It is Taylor's grandmother's
house.

30:34.093 --> 30:36.747
How? How did you do that?

30:36.791 --> 30:38.314
I--I did not do anything.

30:38.358 --> 30:41.317
It is Taylor's grandmother's
house. What is the big deal?

30:41.361 --> 30:45.191
We went to her funeral a year
ago. How do you not remember?

30:45.234 --> 30:47.584
Yes I do remember.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.543
This could be some cruel trick,Sam.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.807
No, no. This is no trick.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.855
So, what do we do now?

30:57.899 --> 31:01.816
I am not sure. It has never
worked before.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.819
What do you want to do babe?

31:04.863 --> 31:08.867
I miss her every single day.

31:09.476 --> 31:10.694
Let us do this.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.000
Hell Yeah! Road Trip!

31:12.044 --> 31:13.132
Awesome.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.960
Yo, this shit is about to get
weird.

31:15.003 --> 31:18.398
Oh and this will add even more.They call it the Sixth Sense.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.660
Yeah, why is that?

31:19.703 --> 31:21.967
One hit and you seeing dead
people, baby.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.055
Just what you need.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.143
Yeah.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.927
APP>> Are you ready to begin?

31:25.971 --> 31:29.975
Here we go.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.991
So after she got out of the
hospital,

31:46.034 --> 31:49.037
I basically quit college to takecare of her.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.213
I just felt too guilty.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.433
Guilty about what?

31:53.476 --> 31:57.045
She took care of me when my dadwas not around. She was my rock.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.961
But while she was getting betterI got in a huge fight with my

32:00.005 --> 32:04.966
dad and said a lot of things.
Things I am not proud of.

32:05.010 --> 32:10.015
And I just took off for a few
days and shut out the world.

32:10.841 --> 32:13.670
By the time I got back they toldme that her lung

32:13.714 --> 32:16.717
had collapsed and she was gone.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.764
I never got the chance to say
goodbye.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.071
I am sorry babe.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.943
APP>>
We are arriving soon.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.989
Oh, it is the one right there.

32:28.033 --> 32:32.037
DEREK>> Alright let us get thisoverwith.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.190
Now what?

33:38.233 --> 33:41.976
APP>>
Your connection is upon us.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.414
I do not understand. What is myconnection?

33:45.458 --> 33:47.068
I guess that could be anything.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.678
I hope it is a naked ghost.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.115
What?

33:50.158 --> 33:52.073
What? You could hear that?

33:52.117 --> 33:53.248
How are we friends?

33:53.292 --> 33:55.903
You do not have any.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.558
Sam, how do we know where to
start looking?

34:01.387 --> 34:03.389
Whoh.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.177
I am going to go wait in the
car.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.223
Chickenshit!

34:11.832 --> 34:13.834
Come on.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.583
SKYLAR>> Oh my God.

34:23.626 --> 34:26.107
Oh, you ok?

34:26.151 --> 34:27.587
DEREK>> What the hell?

34:27.630 --> 34:29.197
NATE>> Your grandma is more of afreak than I remember.

34:29.241 --> 34:32.331
Ah, she used to make really
beautiful dresses.

34:32.374 --> 34:36.204
I forgot she kept these.

34:36.248 --> 34:41.253
See that? Sexy ghost.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.953
Seek help.

34:51.915 --> 34:54.918
Oh my God.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.099
What is that?

35:02.622 --> 35:07.366
My grandmother gave me this
necklace when I graduated high
school.

35:07.409 --> 35:10.891
I was the first girl of my classto make honor role.

35:10.934 --> 35:15.939
She was so proud of me.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.465
The night I got in a fight withmy dad, I was so angry

35:19.508 --> 35:23.164
I tore it off my neck and I
threw it at him.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.514
Just to hurt him.

35:25.558 --> 35:28.561
She wanted you to know.

35:29.910 --> 35:33.696
She wanted me to find this.

35:33.740 --> 35:38.266
God, thank you.

35:38.310 --> 35:42.401
APP>>
The connection has been made.

35:42.444 --> 35:47.449
How does it feel? It works. Youactually did it.

35:50.626 --> 35:53.194
Let us work on that.

35:53.238 --> 35:56.937
So, who is next?

35:56.980 --> 35:59.461
You want to keep this going?

35:59.505 --> 36:04.205
Yeah. I do. What if it helps
someone else?

36:04.249 --> 36:06.207
And what if it does not? What ifit does some crazy shit?

36:06.251 --> 36:11.038
Skyler, we do not have time forany more egg hunts right?

36:11.081 --> 36:12.561
I want to go next.

36:12.605 --> 36:15.347
Skyler, do not touch that--

36:16.870 --> 36:20.874
APP>>
Are you ready to begin?

36:22.136 --> 36:24.138
Holy shit.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.407
Alright.

36:35.628 --> 36:39.371
Alright. Should we go?

36:49.337 --> 36:50.817
SKYLAR>> What am I missing here,Taylor?

36:50.860 --> 36:53.472
Well, we know our dads worked
there together.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.475
There is a lot of information onthe people there. And your
dad, Skylar.

36:56.518 --> 36:57.519
DEREK>> Sam.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.520
About the man that killed him.

36:58.564 --> 36:59.652
SAM!

36:59.695 --> 37:01.131
Why is everyone saying my name?

37:01.175 --> 37:03.133
Because it is the shit we do nottalk about, dickhead!

37:03.177 --> 37:04.787
This is the shit that got you
beat up in High School.

37:04.831 --> 37:08.574
We have been over and over andover this. When will you get it?

37:10.489 --> 37:12.708
I am sorry.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.144
But it is right here.

37:14.188 --> 37:16.625
I know, Sam.

37:16.669 --> 37:18.279
So you know that he was never
convicted?

37:18.323 --> 37:19.585
Even after two trials he was
acquitted.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.542
Jesus Christ, Sam!

37:20.586 --> 37:25.112
Does it say anything else?

37:25.155 --> 37:27.027
It mentions Anna Collins.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.768
NATE>> Who is that?

37:28.811 --> 37:32.554
She was the housekeeper that
worked there. She was killed
too.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.600
They claimed Harold Johnsoncracked her skull in with a bat.

37:36.079 --> 37:39.605
Then wrapped her up in a carpet.

37:39.648 --> 37:44.827
They say seven boys died there
mysteriously as well.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.743
Seven? Jesus.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.310
They closed the school down
after that.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.356
Maybe that is why my dad was sostressed out all the time.

37:51.399 --> 37:52.966
We should have just gone to theclub.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.576
Hey I know you do not care but
what if this spirit wants me

37:54.620 --> 37:56.970
to find something there? Ok,
just like it did with Taylor.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.015
We will see.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.975
APP>>
We are arriving soon.

38:02.018 --> 38:06.022
SKYLAR>> Ok, wait. It says to
make a right at the next road.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.681
Could we get some fries with
that?

38:12.725 --> 38:15.118
Alright, what now?

38:15.162 --> 38:18.165
Uh, I got this.

38:19.862 --> 38:20.689
DEREK>> Nate!

38:20.733 --> 38:23.170
TAYLOR>> What are you doing?

38:25.694 --> 38:27.870
It is not even locked.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.916
Open it.

39:34.807 --> 39:38.811
APP>>
Your connection is upon us.

39:43.032 --> 39:45.774
It is up to you now.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.301
NATE>> Alright.

40:07.056 --> 40:09.276
It is locked. What now?

40:09.319 --> 40:11.017
Should we get a rock or
something?

40:11.060 --> 40:13.454
A rock? Dude I am not cutting myhand on a window.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.674
Hey, nobody is breaking
anything.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.023
Maybe there is another door.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.981
Yeah, where?

40:19.025 --> 40:20.243
I do not know. Maybe there is
another door.

40:20.287 --> 40:23.290
Ok. Go find it, Sam.

40:24.204 --> 40:28.208
Skyler, I just tried the door.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.736
Ooh you do not know your own
strength.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.782
Nice.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.965
Yo, this is cool.

40:46.008 --> 40:51.579
Wait, my phone does not have anysignal now.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.494
The app is still working.

40:53.538 --> 40:57.629
Ok if there is no signal how isthe app still working?

40:57.672 --> 41:02.677
It is not connecting to a cell
tower. It is connecting to a
spirit.

41:17.431 --> 41:18.650
Did you see that?

41:18.911 --> 41:21.087
Did you see that?

41:21.130 --> 41:25.395
Do not start with this paranoiashit. Give it time.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.223
You never have my back.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.399
Whatever, Skyler. You are seeingshit that is not even there.
Look.

41:29.443 --> 41:32.141
What does it take with you? To
pretend that you care?

41:32.185 --> 41:34.666
Justus Christ, you want to do
this right now?

41:34.709 --> 41:36.581
Do what now?

41:36.624 --> 41:39.061
Find out what it
means to give a shit about
anyone other than yourself?

41:39.105 --> 41:43.109
Ok we are going to do this now.Nobody goes anywhere.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.241
Let us go. Come with me. Come
with me, Skyler.

41:45.285 --> 41:46.112
Get off of me!

41:46.155 --> 41:47.461
Skyler get back here.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.158
Get your hands off me.

41:49.202 --> 41:52.205
I am going home.

41:52.814 --> 41:55.251
You know this is going to take awhile, right?

41:55.295 --> 41:57.297
So I do not see why we should
stand here for an hour

41:57.340 --> 42:02.650
as always and wait on their
bullshit when we could wait on
mine.

42:02.694 --> 42:04.173
Oh, what do I get out of it?

42:04.217 --> 42:06.088
More than booze, baby.

42:06.132 --> 42:09.091
Maybe I should just go wait in
the car.

42:09.135 --> 42:12.704
How about you do whatever you
want for the next fifteen
minutes.

42:12.747 --> 42:15.184
Fifteen?

42:15.228 --> 42:18.231
Seventeen.

42:20.363 --> 42:22.322
Alright.

42:22.365 --> 42:25.586
Maybe I should just wait here.

42:25.630 --> 42:29.329
Enough of this shit, Skyler. Weare going home, right now.

42:29.372 --> 42:30.983
No, no, no, no, no, no. You aregoing home.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.941
The rest of us are staying.

42:32.985 --> 42:35.422
This whole trip, this wholeweek, you have been acting likean asshole.

42:35.465 --> 42:38.207
I am the asshole? I am the
asshole as always.

42:38.251 --> 42:40.949
Answer me this Skyler, why are
we out here in the middle of
nowhere

42:40.993 --> 42:46.738
the night before we are supposedto get married chasing your
usual baggage, huh?

42:46.781 --> 42:48.957
I have no idea what you mean.

42:49.001 --> 42:51.569
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bullshit, youdo not know what that means, ok?

42:51.612 --> 42:54.223
We are out here because of yourmom, again.

42:54.267 --> 42:57.226
She died two years ago, Skyler.

42:57.270 --> 43:00.621
How long do the rest of us
have to keep reliving this
shit over and over and over?

43:00.665 --> 43:02.754
Get your hands off me!

43:02.797 --> 43:05.365
I think I am getting a text frombeyond the grave.

1:17:03.706 --> 1:17:08.362

1:17:08.406 --> 1:17:11.409
Sam, she loved you.

1:17:15.413 --> 1:17:19.417
How do you know that?
