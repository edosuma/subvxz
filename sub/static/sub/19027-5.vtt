WEBVTT

00:02.733 --> 00:05.027
After four years,
I know the hospital so well

00:05.094 --> 00:07.798
I can sneak in a little
nap-walk before rounds.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.243
Two quick steps to the left to avoid
overly ambitious orderly....

00:13.910 --> 00:17.324
Hop over the dead guy Doug's dragging,
because he lost his gurney again....

00:17.804 --> 00:20.164
The man's dead,
J.D. Show some respect.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.803
And, finally, Dr. Kelso's 9 A.M.
wrong shoulder tap.

00:25.117 --> 00:27.908
Dammit! Every morning, tapping --
no one's ever there!

00:28.109 --> 00:30.164
'Course, you can't be
ready for everything.

00:30.478 --> 00:32.652
Hey. Help me move this weekend.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.229
We scoff.
And we walk away.

00:36.759 --> 00:40.380
Remind me again why you're
having our son baptized?

00:40.478 --> 00:42.787
Oh, what do you care?
You're not even going!

00:42.844 --> 00:44.299
Fine, let him go to church.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.051
I mean, I let him go to magic shows.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.987
I'll just tell him it's all a lie
when he gets home

00:48.021 --> 00:50.340
so he doesn't have any of
those crazy nightmares.

00:50.692 --> 00:52.509
By the way, I invited your sister.

00:53.292 --> 00:55.371
Jordan, please tell me you didn't.

00:55.484 --> 00:56.875
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie...

00:56.939 --> 00:58.548
I didn't realize you'd be so upset.

00:58.747 --> 01:00.628
I'll call her and tell her
not to come.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.093
How weird would it be
if I was like that!

01:04.197 --> 01:04.894
Totally!

01:05.468 --> 01:06.221
Weird!

01:07.156 --> 01:08.924
When is this joyous occasion?

01:09.334 --> 01:10.299
You're not invited.

01:10.444 --> 01:11.141
Oh, I see.

01:11.221 --> 01:13.429
Family only, everyone!
That's how they're doin' it.

01:13.492 --> 01:14.388
I'm going.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.308
Newbie, gimme a break, will ya.
Of course you're going.

01:17.373 --> 01:21.533
As a matter of fact, I...I'd like you
to be the boy's god-father.

01:22.531 --> 01:24.995
I...

01:25.587 --> 01:26.965
am honored.

01:27.436 --> 01:28.438
I...

01:29.733 --> 01:31.245
am lying.

01:36.381 --> 01:39.228
I'm--I'm not sure I see how that's funny.

01:42.284 --> 01:43.629
Uh, what's with the second beeper?

01:43.707 --> 01:44.899
Carla gave it to me.

01:45.069 --> 01:47.807
She's got me on 24-hour
baby-making alert.

01:47.876 --> 01:49.700
Man, we haven't had sex
since her last ovulation.

01:49.756 --> 01:51.459
Did you know that women only
do that once a month?

01:51.686 --> 01:53.813
Of course I knew that, Turk.
I'm a doctor.

01:54.325 --> 01:56.421
Once a month? That's crazy!

01:56.516 --> 01:58.286
I don't know why I even bother ovulating.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.420
Little Haley doesn't
have a chance this month.

02:01.203 --> 02:04.188
I name my eggs -- big frick.
Last month it was "Cassy."

02:04.251 --> 02:05.709
Ooh, "Cassy"'s pretty.

02:05.780 --> 02:09.098
Oh, she would have been, J.D. She would have been.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.430
Everyone!

02:10.493 --> 02:11.685
This is my sister, Paige.

02:11.748 --> 02:14.774
Paige, I'd like you to meet
random people I don't care about.

02:14.836 --> 02:16.772
Ahh! Here for the baptism!

02:17.412 --> 02:19.685
I remember my son Harrison's big day.

02:19.781 --> 02:23.355
All of us laughing at him in his
frilly little baptism dress.

02:23.437 --> 02:26.973
Heh. Well, we're not laughing anymore.
Harrison's a poofter.

02:27.012 --> 02:28.181
Bob Kelso.

02:28.758 --> 02:30.116
Hi, I'm J.D.

02:30.181 --> 02:31.709
I'm sure Perry's spoken of me.

02:31.788 --> 02:33.413
Noo....

02:33.563 --> 02:36.948
Nothing about taking a talented
go-getter under his wing?

02:37.003 --> 02:39.349
Or being surrogate father
to a boy who's lost his own?

02:39.413 --> 02:40.197
Nothing about that at all?

02:40.243 --> 02:42.139
I'm surprised,
it's interesting to me, but okay.

02:42.153 --> 02:44.478
Don't cry in front of people.

02:44.556 --> 02:45.854
Perry and I don't talk much.

02:45.923 --> 02:47.611
Oh, they don't talk much, everybody!

02:47.692 --> 02:49.189
There's no talking in the family.

02:49.246 --> 02:52.764
Rest assured, Newbie, even if we
did talk from morning till night

02:52.854 --> 02:56.342
about all the big and tiny things that matter
most to me -- the big being my son

02:56.405 --> 03:00.197
Jack, a cure for cancer, and the resurgence
of the hard-shelled taco --

03:00.260 --> 03:06.126
The small being my ex-wife, Jordan,
wind energy, and a-ha-hall fruit-infused liquors

03:06.140 --> 03:09.229
your name still would not have come up.

03:09.748 --> 03:12.981
I'm honestly not sure which one of
you I find more hhhirritating.

03:13.268 --> 03:15.794
What does he find "he-h-irritating" about you?

03:15.900 --> 03:18.644
Fire at will.

03:18.788 --> 03:21.907
I've embraced the Lord Jesus Christ
as my personal savior.

03:23.317 --> 03:25.645
I'm not sure why it was
suddenly so awkward,

03:25.717 --> 03:28.004
but I wish something
would break the tension.

03:29.282 --> 03:32.733
Hallelujah!
A brotha's 'bout to have some sex!

03:32.860 --> 03:38.211
Ha Ha! Hallelujah!
A brotha's 'bout to have some seeeeeeex!

03:39.068 --> 03:41.532
Smack the money-maker!

03:41.611 --> 03:43.171
Smack it.

03:43.229 --> 03:44.789
That's how he likes it.

03:44.822 --> 03:46.308
Ahhh! Sex time, people!

03:46.382 --> 03:49.276
He's married,
so it's strictly procreation sex.

03:49.588 --> 03:52.990
His wife's throwing her legs up in the air,
because they're trying for a boy,

03:54.308 --> 03:55.805
...like Jesus!

03:57.268 --> 03:59.469

04:11.397 --> 04:13.651
You know what used to
drive Perry nuts as a kid?

04:13.723 --> 04:16.916
Every night we'd play Horse in the driveway,
and I'd always kick his ass.

04:17.310 --> 04:19.076
Can Christians say "ass" now?

04:19.156 --> 04:22.444
I have a friend ,Pat Casey
he called his mom an ass once?

04:22.509 --> 04:24.778
She hit him in the face with an iron!

04:25.189 --> 04:28.148
He still goes to church,
but he can't whistle anymore.

04:28.692 --> 04:31.021
Okay. I'm gonna go say hi to Jordan.

04:32.572 --> 04:33.915
She's dynamite.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.685
How'd you end up with
a born-again Christian sister?

04:36.766 --> 04:37.812
I don't know.

04:38.483 --> 04:40.228
Maybe the T.V. was broken one day

04:40.283 --> 04:43.685
and she picked up the Bible
and found it to be just a darn good read.

04:43.747 --> 04:46.588
Or maybe it had something
to do with our mother's ability

04:46.666 --> 04:48.923
to watch silently as our dad drunkenly

04:48.995 --> 04:50.995
knocked us from room to room.

04:51.062 --> 04:52.733
Whatta you think there, Newbie?

04:53.026 --> 04:54.627
Probably the "room to room" thing.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.346
It's always hard to find the right
words at a moment like this.

04:59.454 --> 05:02.209
Dr. Cox!
If it makes you feel any better,

05:02.271 --> 05:04.879
at the baptism I'll be there
to keep Paige company.

05:04.944 --> 05:05.680
Yeah.

05:05.855 --> 05:06.879
You're not going.

05:07.478 --> 05:08.615
Dammit!

05:08.774 --> 05:10.165
Stupid baptism.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.064
I'm gonna have some sex!

05:13.151 --> 05:15.927
I'm gonna have some
seeeeeaaaggghhh!

05:16.295 --> 05:18.079
Okay, so my cervical mucus is peaking,

05:18.144 --> 05:20.088
my temperature is slightly elevated,

05:20.161 --> 05:22.201
and these pillows will
keep my vagina angled

05:22.271 --> 05:24.110
so that the semen can
pool against my cervix.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.495
Baby, that is some
god-awful dirty talk.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.879
Turk, we're making a baby.
Let's get down to business.

05:28.944 --> 05:30.800
Honey, I need to feel the heat!

05:31.000 --> 05:33.300
I need at least thirty minutes of foreplay -- then,

05:33.399 --> 05:36.415
and only then, can I be fully ready,

05:36.550 --> 05:38.519
...to make love to you.

05:38.656 --> 05:39.870
Tyra Banks.

05:41.255 --> 05:42.584
There. You're ready.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:03.303 --> 06:06.944
Oh, hey fellas? I'm trying to give
somebody evil eye over there.

06:07.007 --> 06:10.038
Would you mind breaking it up
so I can...? You understand.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.384
Thanks, fellas.

06:11.464 --> 06:13.343
Very nice of you. I appreciate it!

06:13.399 --> 06:14.463
Thank you.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.480
He's just mad because
I won't help him move.

06:22.545 --> 06:24.000
Well, you shoulda done it.

06:24.088 --> 06:26.016
Helping someone move is
like oral sex,

06:26.064 --> 06:28.144
you do it once and then
they owe you for life.

06:28.576 --> 06:30.232
Mm. My high school boyfriend's
an accountant now,

06:30.302 --> 06:32.399
and he still does my taxes for free.

06:32.463 --> 06:33.959
You know what's weird?

06:34.024 --> 06:36.223
He also does my brother Barry's.

06:36.288 --> 06:40.805
My son, Harrison, dabbles in sado-masochism
and he has a new gimp named Barry.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.744
Or is it Larry?

06:42.800 --> 06:46.007
At my age, it's getting harder and
harder to keep track of his gimps.

06:46.086 --> 06:48.122
And then it occurred to me.

06:48.168 --> 06:51.752
This was the perfect opportunity to
take an enemy and turn him into a friend!

06:52.737 --> 06:53.624
I'll do it!

06:53.735 --> 06:54.672
I knew you would.

06:54.759 --> 06:55.928
You're very predictable.

06:56.014 --> 06:57.278
- No I'm not!
- No I'm not!

06:57.952 --> 06:59.031
- Stop doing that!
- Stop doing that!

06:59.829 --> 07:01.624
- Peanut butter egg dirt!
- Peanut butter egg dirt!

07:01.687 --> 07:04.158
Newbie, let's go. Mr. Donnelly's
test results are in.

07:06.144 --> 07:09.192
It's never easy to tell a family
that medicine isn't working.

07:09.255 --> 07:11.971
I, uh, I wish I had better news for you.

07:12.971 --> 07:16.394
Unfortunately, we're not seeing the improvement
we'd hoped for with this medication.

07:16.952 --> 07:18.738
What are our options?

07:19.249 --> 07:21.218
I'm afraid there are no other options.

07:21.338 --> 07:23.834
There's always prayer.

07:25.130 --> 07:26.458
Oh, no.

07:26.536 --> 07:30.266
You know, with God by your side,
anything is possible.

07:30.545 --> 07:34.550
Could I speak with you in the
"stop filling my patient's head with false hope" ward?

07:37.531 --> 07:40.057
Paige. We have protocol here.

07:40.122 --> 07:42.194
First we shake our magic 8 ball,

07:42.259 --> 07:44.896
then we explore all witchcraft-related options.

07:45.019 --> 07:45.954
Oh, right.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.834
'Cause people who believe in God are crazy!

07:47.898 --> 07:49.487
And you're the same one!

07:49.569 --> 07:51.987
Hey! You guys like improv?

07:52.050 --> 07:53.697
'Cause I'm kind of an expert.

07:53.904 --> 07:55.466
There's a game we play in class where

07:55.538 --> 07:57.706
you make up what people are saying.

07:57.802 --> 07:59.041
Like, watch:

07:59.401 --> 08:00.663
"Do you want some pie?"

08:01.012 --> 08:02.403
"Not me, I hate pie."

08:02.571 --> 08:04.410
"What are you talking about?
Who hates pie?"

08:04.475 --> 08:05.444
"Everyone loves pie!"

08:05.516 --> 08:08.137
"I've always hated pie!
You never understood me!"

08:08.331 --> 08:09.689
"You're a pie racist!"

08:09.745 --> 08:11.603
"Well, you're a cobbler whore!"

08:12.233 --> 08:14.290
For God's sake, get off pie!

08:14.632 --> 08:15.387
Jerk!

08:15.456 --> 08:16.384
Republican.

08:16.449 --> 08:18.466
"Piiiiiie."

08:21.209 --> 08:24.369
Gotta find an improv class that
doesn't meet in the back of a pie shop.

08:25.901 --> 08:29.521
Aw, dammit,
I gotta go have ovulation sex again.

08:29.649 --> 08:32.291
Are you actually complaining
about getting to have sex?

08:32.339 --> 08:34.595
Because that is so insensitive, Turk!

08:34.690 --> 08:35.042
J.D.!

08:35.105 --> 08:37.625
Let me feel my feelings, Turk!

08:37.682 --> 08:39.193
We worked on this!

08:40.961 --> 08:42.794
I've really gotta stop doing that!

08:43.106 --> 08:44.585
You can talk to me if you want?

08:44.682 --> 08:46.690
Elliot, I can't talk to you about sex,

08:46.761 --> 08:49.368
I don't understand any of
that crazy gibberish you use.

08:49.409 --> 08:51.072
"Penis" is "schwing"-something....

08:51.145 --> 08:53.330
"Schwing-schwong," "peepers," or "peep."

08:53.538 --> 08:54.953
Right. And "vagina" is...?

08:54.986 --> 08:57.730
Disgusting!
But also "bajingo" or "hoo-hoo."

08:58.402 --> 08:59.386
Here's the deal:

08:59.682 --> 09:01.537
I'm trying to get in the mood, right?

09:01.640 --> 09:05.235
And Carla's going on and
on about her cervical mucus.

09:05.315 --> 09:11.027
From now on "cervical mucus" will be
referred to as "icky sticky."

09:11.280 --> 09:12.434
"Icky sticky."

09:12.529 --> 09:13.577
Continue.

09:14.691 --> 09:15.738
Morning, sunshine!

09:15.802 --> 09:17.154
Never say that again.

09:17.217 --> 09:18.979
Noted.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.427
That was quite a fight you
had with your sister yesterday.

09:21.922 --> 09:23.217
Won't it be a little awkward,

09:23.265 --> 09:24.673
when you show up you show up
at St. Mary's Cathedral,

09:24.754 --> 09:30.136
on the corner of Maple and Pine,
right across from Temple Oheb Shalom, at 4 P.M. today?

09:30.201 --> 09:32.715
That's not where the baptism is,
but nice try.

09:32.745 --> 09:33.626
Mark my words,

09:33.674 --> 09:36.000
when that little bastard's dipped in water,
I will be there.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.859
Anyway, I just invited Paige to come by.

09:39.953 --> 09:41.977
Mr. Donnelly's labs came back and

09:42.057 --> 09:44.200
it looks like the steroid is finally working.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.249
If you happen to be keeping score at home,
that would be

09:46.313 --> 09:47.746
Medicine,One - God, Zero.

09:47.802 --> 09:49.494
Ah, you don't have to
rub it in her face.

09:49.557 --> 09:52.394
Yeah, and I don't have to stick Kelso's stethoscope
down my pants every morning,

09:52.394 --> 09:53.453
but I still do.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.802
Now isn't there some other relationship
you could be out there trying to fix?

09:57.715 --> 09:59.498
Actually, there was.

10:00.025 --> 10:01.570
Morning, sunshine!

10:01.826 --> 10:03.072
I don't like that.

10:03.162 --> 10:04.761
Nobody seems to.

10:04.884 --> 10:07.408
Well, come on.
Grab some boxes, let's get to movin', huh?

10:08.427 --> 10:10.833
I hope I can find a way
to connect with him.

10:22.395 --> 10:24.562
Thanks for saving that --
that's one of my favorite pieces.

10:24.802 --> 10:26.280
You're welcome, friend!

10:27.041 --> 10:29.482
I gotta say, you got a lot of
Asian art around here.

10:29.570 --> 10:32.241
When I was a kid, I always thought I'd, uh,
travel the world, you know?

10:32.322 --> 10:33.865
So after college, I went to China.

10:33.947 --> 10:35.505
Did all the normal touristy things,

10:35.571 --> 10:37.643
I saw the Great Wall,
ate the food,

10:37.722 --> 10:39.674
had a baby with a local,

10:39.985 --> 10:41.562
You know, just the regular stuff.

10:41.643 --> 10:44.042
Anyway, I guess I decorate my place this way
'cause it reminds me of a more,

10:44.105 --> 10:46.136
...optimistic time.

10:46.682 --> 10:48.147
That probably sounds crazy.

10:48.427 --> 10:49.929
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

10:50.278 --> 10:51.961
Thanks, man.

10:52.051 --> 10:54.162
And like that,
I was in.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.346
Damn!

11:01.538 --> 11:04.173
DONUTS DONUTS
Day Old Donuts
50% Off - After 5PM

11:06.522 --> 11:07.976
I paged you an hour ago!

11:08.725 --> 11:10.162
I was in surgery.

11:12.187 --> 11:15.450
Is that doughnut glaze
on your cheek?

11:16.130 --> 11:17.712
Guess we're not having sex, huh?

11:17.825 --> 11:19.466
Oh, ho, ho, no. We're having sex.

11:19.530 --> 11:20.498
Get in there.

11:20.577 --> 11:22.015
Wait, baby...I'm too full.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.195
Now, Turk.

11:23.355 --> 11:24.616
Man!

11:25.370 --> 11:28.178
Long story short,
after confirming it with my bunk-mates,

11:28.250 --> 11:32.856
that counselor and his
"friendship lotion" were transferred out of our cabin,

11:32.921 --> 11:34.995
and we never spoke about it again.

11:35.089 --> 11:37.226
Well, "what doesn't kill ya..."

11:37.307 --> 11:40.410
We're as thick as two thieves in a pod!

11:41.434 --> 11:43.791
Okay! Time to move some of the heavier stuff,

11:43.863 --> 11:45.639
so you might want to put on these gloves.

11:46.594 --> 11:49.120
Aaaand the attic upstairs
has a lot of fiberglass in it,

11:49.217 --> 11:50.783
...so a little hat.

11:50.868 --> 11:51.664
Thanks, pal!

11:51.730 --> 11:52.905
Sure, bud!

11:53.378 --> 11:56.144
I figured out why
I'm so great at managing relationships....

11:57.587 --> 11:59.523
...I don't rub things in people's faces.

12:00.322 --> 12:01.581
I thought you might like to know,

12:01.662 --> 12:05.118
that your husband's chest x-ray looks better.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.554
He is finally starting to improve.

12:07.913 --> 12:09.352
Thank you so much.

12:09.530 --> 12:11.139
I was really just doing my job--

12:11.207 --> 12:13.778
Oh, I'm...talking to Paige.

12:13.986 --> 12:16.083
She was up all night praying with us.

12:19.898 --> 12:21.178
Stupid jerk!

12:22.715 --> 12:25.898
...I never go to bed very, very mad.

12:26.115 --> 12:28.376
Angry sex is awesome!

12:29.519 --> 12:32.961
And I've always known if I make even
the slightest gesture of friendship,

12:33.018 --> 12:34.577
to a difficult co-worker...

12:36.465 --> 12:37.770
Who are you!?!?

12:38.394 --> 12:41.259
...I'll end up robbing
an Asian couple's house.

12:46.048 --> 12:47.000
I couldn't help wondering,

12:47.168 --> 12:49.763
what the sentence was
for stealing a Buddha.

12:49.826 --> 12:52.674
After all,
people get pretty sensitive about religion.

12:55.528 --> 12:57.402
Could I comment on the baptism dress?

12:58.033 --> 13:00.691
I think you should wait to see
the matching slippers and tiny handbag.

13:00.921 --> 13:06.313
You're actually encouraging him to cross-dress on
the same day that you're introducing him to a religion

13:06.385 --> 13:08.961
that will condemn him to Hell for it.

13:09.154 --> 13:11.331
That's a trauma twofer.

13:11.403 --> 13:14.354
Can you two please just try to get along?

13:14.408 --> 13:16.315
Now I'm getting some blush for Jack,

13:16.379 --> 13:18.802
because this lace collar
is washing out his face.

13:18.889 --> 13:19.907
Terrible.

13:20.003 --> 13:23.993
Paige, will you just acknowledge
that medicine made Mr. Donnelly better?

13:24.123 --> 13:26.602
Fine. It was medicine.

13:26.769 --> 13:29.361
Thank God for creating medicine.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.019
A-ghe-de-geh-geh-geh!
That's it!

13:31.274 --> 13:34.850
That is it.
Now you, you may be a total goner,

13:34.928 --> 13:36.904
but God's not getting his hands on this one.

13:36.961 --> 13:38.681
No way, no how.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.399
Jackie boy,
we got places to go.

13:44.317 --> 13:46.198
Turk! I'm ready!

13:47.480 --> 13:48.207
All right.

13:48.873 --> 13:50.693
So angry sex is awesome.

13:51.126 --> 13:53.056
That's no reason to go down a bad road.

13:55.072 --> 13:56.841
Baby, you know what I miss?

13:57.855 --> 13:59.934
When your body was kickin'.

14:00.744 --> 14:02.880
I ain't touchin' no damn diapers.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.440
Baby, all I'm saying is

14:07.519 --> 14:09.174
that in some European countries,

14:09.238 --> 14:11.831
it's totally acceptable for a man
to have a mistress.

14:12.078 --> 14:13.572
Why you--

14:20.581 --> 14:23.309
I'm gonna make you pay for
every word you said!

14:26.370 --> 14:27.765
Worth it!

14:29.995 --> 14:32.371
Now that I'm on the lam,
I thought about two things.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.875
One, what my prison name would be...

14:35.014 --> 14:36.085
Gizmo!

14:36.221 --> 14:39.020
...and Two, whether some relationships
were beyond repair.

14:40.509 --> 14:43.020
Then Fate threw me another curve.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.187
Hey, who's your friend?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.605
My boy in a dress.
Who's yours?

14:45.893 --> 14:48.631
Well, seeing as he gave me the strength
to outrun the sheriff's K-9 unit,

14:48.697 --> 14:50.458
I'd say he's my new god.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.469
You can rub mine's belly
if I can rub yours'.

14:54.573 --> 14:56.111
Don't you touch my son.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.236
Angry sex is like a drug.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.773
I can't stop!

15:00.909 --> 15:02.470
I'll be right out,
I'm just fixing my hair.

15:02.722 --> 15:04.620
Rake's in the closet, baby!

15:06.899 --> 15:07.956
Help me!

15:08.446 --> 15:10.975
Turk! Just go back to the way things were.
Carla loved it.

15:11.155 --> 15:12.229
Don't you get it?

15:12.293 --> 15:15.442
Trying to make a baby with you is
the sexiest thing in the world to her.

15:15.730 --> 15:16.994
Elliot, I'm a man.

15:17.177 --> 15:20.682
I've been programmed to think that a baby is
the worst possible consequence of sex.

15:20.865 --> 15:21.931
Well, it's not.

15:23.394 --> 15:26.673
Honey for my honey!

15:35.369 --> 15:36.503
Why are you stopping?

15:42.394 --> 15:43.938
Losing a baseball scholarship

15:44.019 --> 15:47.315
because a bear ate your arm is
a much worse consequence of sex.

15:47.544 --> 15:50.129
You have to help me end this angry sex cycle!

15:50.681 --> 15:51.433
I'm ready.

15:51.532 --> 15:52.364
Oh, Carla,

15:52.448 --> 15:55.592
Turk's making you mad on purpose
because the angry sex is so good.

15:57.235 --> 15:59.952
The cycle is broken!

16:02.177 --> 16:04.985
There will be no whining or
crying while we sit here, understood?

16:05.066 --> 16:06.394
He seems fine.

16:06.457 --> 16:07.753
I wasn't talking to him.

16:07.905 --> 16:09.937
I don't whine or cry.

16:10.017 --> 16:10.866
Really?

16:10.937 --> 16:11.961
Then how do you explain these photos of you

16:12.018 --> 16:13.423
whining and crying as you

16:13.490 --> 16:15.568
run away from the Kwans' apartment?

16:16.587 --> 16:17.946
These are coasters.

16:18.028 --> 16:19.234
My camera's broken.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.907
You turned me into a felon!

16:20.970 --> 16:22.490
You know what, there, Newbie?

16:22.571 --> 16:24.186
You can go to the baptism.

16:24.386 --> 16:25.586
Now take Jack,

16:25.634 --> 16:27.490
Jordan'll kill me if he's not there.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.147
Plus, I know you,

16:29.352 --> 16:33.378
you're exactly one watered-down appletini away
from trying to fix my sister and me.

16:33.442 --> 16:34.394
No, thank you.

16:34.465 --> 16:35.772
If there's one thing I learned from this guy,

16:35.831 --> 16:38.139
it's I need to stop trying to
fix people's relationships.

16:39.115 --> 16:40.202
You're welcome.

16:40.649 --> 16:43.530
Still, I've never known you to
judge a person based on their beliefs.

16:43.653 --> 16:45.787
In fact, you're pretty tolerant of everyone.

16:45.866 --> 16:47.596
Except Hugh Jackman.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.663
I just don't understand why your sister
being religious bothers you so much.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.422
...It doesn't.

16:54.557 --> 16:55.999
Then why are you so angry?

16:59.495 --> 17:01.089
"So, do you like pie?"

17:01.432 --> 17:04.060
"Look at me, do I look like a
guy who doesn't like pie?"

17:04.183 --> 17:05.423
"I love pie."

17:05.663 --> 17:08.345
"Incidentally,
where do you buy your loincloths?"

17:09.559 --> 17:12.942
I--I don't think I can do this without Perry.
I mean, he's my everything.

17:13.528 --> 17:15.392
You're right.
It would be weird if you were like that.

17:15.471 --> 17:16.127
Right?

17:16.192 --> 17:17.007
Yeah.

17:17.448 --> 17:19.833
I just don't understand why
we can't have fun while making a baby.

17:19.894 --> 17:21.895
I am just so glad you have to
hurt my feelings to have fun.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.269
- I can't believe you! Calm down!
- Great, that's really nice for you. "Calm down"?

17:24.299 --> 17:25.848
I'm gonna kill you!

17:25.880 --> 17:26.759
You hear that?

17:26.816 --> 17:28.039
She's gonna kill me!

17:28.121 --> 17:29.497
Get her.

17:29.568 --> 17:30.871
Okay, look, you two stop fighting or

17:30.928 --> 17:32.950
I will turn this church around.

17:33.727 --> 17:36.679
Sometimes I think it takes a child 
to make you see the light.

18:31.756 --> 18:33.115
Isn't he beautiful?

18:37.082 --> 18:37.905
Yeah...

18:39.050 --> 18:40.122
He is.

18:59.851 --> 19:03.083
Oh! Wow! Has anyone ever told you 
you're an extremely average athlete?

19:03.163 --> 19:05.201
That's cold, sis. It's ice cold.

19:05.888 --> 19:10.463
You know, uh, I been thinking about 
why I hate seeing you so much.

19:10.554 --> 19:12.106
Please, Perry, don't hold back.

19:12.547 --> 19:14.689
It's not the God stuff.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.034
I have worked hard...

19:19.210 --> 19:21.490
to try to forget everything about our childhood.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.758
But when I see you, I...

19:25.130 --> 19:27.419
I can't think about anything else.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.660
It's hard for me, too.

19:31.393 --> 19:33.073
But I don't see why you can't be there

19:33.145 --> 19:34.906
for the major events in Jack's life.

19:35.172 --> 19:36.674
I'd love to see him turn three.

19:37.923 --> 19:40.083
The major events, Paige.

19:40.457 --> 19:43.555
His graduation, his wedding, his divorce, and his funeral.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.019
The Big Four.

19:45.294 --> 19:47.846
I beat you at Horse,
 he has a church wedding.

19:47.901 --> 19:48.779
Done.

19:51.979 --> 19:53.707
That went in, didn't it?

19:54.196 --> 19:56.836
Did you thank the G-Man for that?

19:56.923 --> 19:58.805
That was all me, baby.

19:59.405 --> 19:59.905
Yeah, it was.

20:01.253 --> 20:03.718
So maybe relationships can be fixed.

20:05.142 --> 20:07.726
Whether it's by coming around to 
your spouse's way of thinking...

20:08.125 --> 20:08.964
Well, I'm sorry.

20:08.980 --> 20:12.028
I didn't get how this baby-making 
stuff could be sexy.

20:12.909 --> 20:14.203
But I do now.

20:14.924 --> 20:18.653
Well, you know, Turk, 
I can get angry if you give me a little help.

20:22.060 --> 20:24.805
If you had no hair, 
you'd look like Danny DeVito.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.932
Aw, Turk, a little help.

20:29.676 --> 20:31.464
...or by reassuring the Kwans that,

20:31.537 --> 20:34.037
their Big Guy didn't desert them.
"I MISSED YOU"

20:36.076 --> 20:38.596
In the end, 
you just have to be willing to take the first step.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.605
By the way, if you want, 
Jack's birthday is in the spring...

20:43.404 --> 20:44.340
...sometime.

20:44.404 --> 20:46.458
March 21st. 
Bye, Perry.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.404
Bye, Paige.

20:52.797 --> 20:55.003
You know, 
"Paige" is a silly name.

20:55.474 --> 20:56.611
"Perry"'s worse.
