17:28.200 --> 17:30.396
An Indian. I think.

17:31.960 --> 17:32.950
Get the phone, kid.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.116
We better alert
the local constable.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.158
The...
The sheriff, you idiot.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.230
Yeah.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.517
(MUFFLED BEDSPRINGS SQUEAKING)

(SQUEAKING CONTINUES)

18:21.280 --> 18:22.350
(EXHALES)

18:27.440 --> 18:29.317
Surprised me there at the end.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.877
Your finger.
Ya like that?

18:35.120 --> 18:37.589
Didn't say I liked it.
Said you surprised me.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.474
You got that bump, then?

19:00.520 --> 19:02.636
I'm worried your family's gonna
go the wrong way on this thing.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.913
Floyd's smart.
She'll take the money.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.875
What about your dad?

19:08.440 --> 19:11.990
Him?
You probably gotta kill him.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.875
(SNIFFS)

19:14.960 --> 19:16.234
And you're okay with that?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.069
(SIGHS)

19:21.440 --> 19:22.874
Ya know what depresses me?

19:23.480 --> 19:25.073
I missed the '60s.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.955
Free love,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.960
drop acid, Woodstock.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.279
Wake up one day, decide you wanna
call yourself Flower Rain Blossom?

19:34.760 --> 19:37.274
You just call yourself
Flower Rain Blossom.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.833
Yeah, but the '70s were
always coming like a...

19:41.920 --> 19:43.433
What do you...

19:44.440 --> 19:45.430
A hangover.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.117
And you know what happened
to Flower Rain Blossom?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.277
She's on methadone
in Bismarck,

20:01.760 --> 20:03.671
turning tricks
for breakfast meat.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.717
I know, but at least
I would have had fun.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.630
Be free.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.949
Like how you get to dream
before you wake up.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.472
I saw the Indian
left town yesterday.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.790
Hanzee?

20:28.920 --> 20:30.479
Dad sent him to find Rye.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.559
He shot a judge, I heard.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.031
So he's either
hiding out now or dead.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.396
Either way, could
be gone for good.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.833
You're boring me.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.037
I thought we were
gonna have some fun.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.159
We had fun, darling.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.554
All I know is, I can still
feel your finger in my ass.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.040
That was my thumb.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.876
So, the sit-down today.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.314
You think Floyd says yes?

21:06.520 --> 21:07.510
Takes the deal?

21:08.120 --> 21:09.110
What I hear?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.713
She's got a compromise.

21:12.880 --> 21:13.870
Give some,

21:15.360 --> 21:16.350
keep some.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.074
Is that Otto's idea?

21:19.280 --> 21:21.794
Grandpa? No.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.079
He's a legume.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.233
They're taking him
to the doctor later,

21:26.800 --> 21:28.518
see if they can
stop the drooling.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.070
Is that right?

21:32.720 --> 21:33.710
Which doctor?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.115
(GRUNTS)

22:09.360 --> 22:12.034
Thought I'd take Molly
ice fishing this weekend.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.920
Bring something more than
just jerky this time.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.837
That's what my dad brought.
Yeah.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.033
But she's six
and she's a girl.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.833
Gonna have to
learn this stuff.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.710
So...

22:31.480 --> 22:32.959
Should I be...

22:34.280 --> 22:35.395
I don't know, uh...

22:36.440 --> 22:38.431
Treating you any different?
Please don't.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.553
Well, you let me know.
Mmm-hmm.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.756
Better get inside and take
my sugar pills. (CHUCKLES)

22:52.800 --> 22:54.996
DISPATCHER: (OVER RADIO)
State Car 18, come back. Over.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.794
Uh, that's me...
Yeah, I know.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.390
Go, I'll be fine.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.757
State Car 18,
come back. Over.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.153
Indian buck.
Had, like, a rat face.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.512
Didn't much like
the look of him.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.517
Scared me a little.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.474
Sorry.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.552
Took Betsy to a specialist.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.150
And?

23:25.840 --> 23:28.798
Uh, well, there's a trial.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.838
Clinical. New drug, so...

23:33.800 --> 23:36.030
Uh, we signed up for that.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.234
What did I miss here?

23:38.520 --> 23:40.113
Uh, well, uh...

23:40.520 --> 23:44.229
Well, this Indian fella
put a scare to Sonny.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.478
Luckily, Karl was nearby
stressing the plumbing,

23:47.560 --> 23:48.789
scared the Indian off.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.270
What was he was doing exactly,
this, uh, Indian?

23:51.360 --> 23:52.680
I found him out
here in the bay,

23:52.960 --> 23:55.190
looking over Ed's car.
Seemed real interested.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.590
Ed Renner?

23:56.680 --> 23:59.593
No. Ed Blumquist. You know,
works Bud's butcher shop.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.840
Wife's car, technically. Got some
front-end damage, you can see.

24:07.520 --> 24:12.515
As in, front-end damage like the
kind you get running down a gunman

24:12.600 --> 24:14.511
who just shot up three people
at the Waffle Hut?

24:14.840 --> 24:15.830
The what now?

24:16.400 --> 24:20.109
No, no, this was from
a accident yesterday.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.634
Bluth took the report.

24:21.720 --> 24:26.715
Said the Blumquists hit a
tree off Ice Patch Junction.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.629
Tree branch went through the
window. Lucky the wife wasn't killed.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.880
Hit it coming and going?

24:35.960 --> 24:37.917
Yeah, I saw that.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.310
SONNY: Peggy said garage
door bit her in the back,

24:40.600 --> 24:43.718
but I found bits o' wood
in the bumper so...

24:44.160 --> 24:46.720
I'm not saying she's
lying but, you know, well...

24:48.760 --> 24:52.230
Hey. Burning it at
both ends, huh? Yeah.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.755
(PHONE RINGING)

24:58.080 --> 24:59.753
You gonna get that?

25:01.440 --> 25:02.430
Yeah.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.435
Thank you for sitting
with me here today,

26:07.520 --> 26:10.080
and for giving us time
to consider your offer.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.993
I've asked the bank to
arbitrate, as neutral party.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.994
Whatever makes you
comfortable. This is your town.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.239
Where's Mr. Milligan?

26:20.320 --> 26:22.709
Another matter.
Back in Kansas City.

26:24.160 --> 26:28.154
So, we've given you 48 hours
to consider. Do we have a deal?

26:29.560 --> 26:30.550
No.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.718
But I have a counter offer.
A respectful one.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.836
Instead of a straight
sale, us to you,

26:38.760 --> 26:41.798
we pay you one million,
cash money,

26:41.880 --> 26:44.235
plus 20% of our
territory in Minnesota.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.838
We also discount
transportation fees

26:47.960 --> 26:49.359
on all Kansas City
merchandise,

26:49.440 --> 26:51.670
25% for the first five years.

26:52.960 --> 26:53.950
In exchange,

26:55.520 --> 26:58.273
we retain full control of
our remaining operations.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.080
The Gerhardt family
still runs North Dakota,

27:03.880 --> 27:05.678
but with Kansas City.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.234
A partnership, not a sale.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.518
That's our offer to you.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.432
And we believe it's
more than fair.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.115
I see.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.590
Now...

27:23.800 --> 27:24.790
I don't know.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.554
Maybe when you look at
me you see an old woman.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.878
And |I am 61.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.509
I've borne six children.
Had three miscarriages.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.557
Two of my sons are here today.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.074
Two were stillborn.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.879
My firstborn,
Elron, killed in Korea.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.310
Gook sniper took
off half his head.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.475
The point is...

27:55.520 --> 27:59.195
Don't assume just
because I'm an old woman

27:59.520 --> 28:02.990
that my back is weak and
my stomach is not strong.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.434
I make this counter because a
deal is always better than war.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.635
But no mistake.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.639
We'll fight to keep what's
ours to the last man.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.838
You're a good woman.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.159
I wish I had
known your husband.

28:22.840 --> 28:23.830
No.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.149
My husband would
have killed you

28:26.240 --> 28:27.799
where you stood the
first time you met.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.511
So be glad you're
talking to his wife.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.960
Then that's what I'm glad for.

28:37.880 --> 28:41.669
And if it were up to me,
I would take your counter.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.870
Partner up.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.150
Except...

28:47.920 --> 28:51.879
I got to admit, I just wonder,
if we make this deal,

28:52.560 --> 28:56.076
split the territory,
we move in,

28:56.920 --> 28:59.389
can you guarantee
your boys will abide?

29:00.040 --> 29:02.190
My sons listen
to their mother.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.674
Good. Okay.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.515
Except here are two of my men,

29:11.840 --> 29:13.558
assaulted just
this morning

29:13.640 --> 29:16.632
in the appropriation of
donuts by your oldest.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.316
Attacked in peacetime,

29:21.480 --> 29:23.630
during a period
of deliberation,

29:24.360 --> 29:26.271
without provocation.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.759
Oh, I was provoked.

29:27.840 --> 29:28.830
Hush.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.957
My sons will abide.

29:31.640 --> 29:36.840
Ah, see, see, that's the
problem with a family business.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.556
Now, if one of my
men defies me,

29:40.280 --> 29:44.035
puts a deal in jeopardy,
I take his arm.

29:44.520 --> 29:47.114
If he talks out of turn,
I take his tongue.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.440
But you, your children,

29:50.520 --> 29:53.831
your grandchildren, what
are you willing to do

29:53.920 --> 29:55.718
to show us you're committed?

29:57.040 --> 30:00.590
I'll deal with my son.
This partnership will hold.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.795
Come on. You're
gonna let this guy

30:01.880 --> 30:04.349
come here and disrespect us?
Disrespect Pop?

30:04.440 --> 30:06.556
Quiet!
A bunch o' fruits in ties!

30:06.640 --> 30:08.790
And your pocket protectors?
I'll pick my teeth...

30:08.880 --> 30:10.712
Take him out!
Fricking teeth.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.079
Jeez, get off me!

30:15.720 --> 30:16.710
(DOOR CLOSES)

30:18.240 --> 30:19.719
I apologize.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.594
He's a proud man.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.751
His father built an empire,
and he just wants what's his.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.075
He'll fall into line.

30:28.880 --> 30:29.870
No.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.479
I don't think he will.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.430
Hold up.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.114
Who's the dumb-ass?

31:00.120 --> 31:02.077
Go around to the
passenger seat.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.430
Slide across.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.150
Hurry up. Hurry up!

31:21.120 --> 31:22.758
(ENGINE SPUTTERS)

31:45.840 --> 31:47.319
(SPUTTERING CONTINUES)

31:55.480 --> 31:56.879
Well, what's the hold up?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.394
Think maybe I flooded it.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.313
(ENGINE STARTS)

32:13.320 --> 32:15.391
Take him inside! Go!

32:40.720 --> 32:41.710
(GRUMBLES)

32:42.760 --> 32:44.512
Joe Bulo says hi.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.118
Your counter
has been rejected.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.029
And now we're lowering
our price by two million.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.276
But because I respect
you and your family,

33:25.360 --> 33:27.749
I'm gonna give you the
night to think it over.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.239
Anything other than
unconditional surrender

33:31.480 --> 33:34.518
and we'll wipe every last
Gerhardt off the face of the Earth.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.274
(CHOPPING)

34:00.760 --> 34:01.830
Hey, Bud.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.790
Where the heck did
you go yesterday?

34:04.880 --> 34:08.953
Yeah, I'm real sorry about
that. Peg had a kinda

34:10.040 --> 34:12.156
emergency, and
you Know... Well...

34:13.920 --> 34:16.639
You know that check you gave
me? For the down payment?

34:16.719 --> 34:17.790
Yeah?

34:18.360 --> 34:19.953
Yeah, it bounced.

34:20.840 --> 34:21.830
No. That's not...

34:23.440 --> 34:25.431
I checked the account myself.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.719
But anyway, I got the funds.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.120
Well, I don't know
about that.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.713
It's just, the check you gave
me didn't clear, so you know...

34:33.679 --> 34:35.114
There's this other buyer,

34:36.120 --> 34:39.829
up in Sleepy Eye, wants to be
closer to his sick mother, yeah.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.397
He offered more
than you, and...

34:44.120 --> 34:45.235
I'm moving to Florida, so...

34:45.320 --> 34:46.833
Bud, no.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.518
I got the funds.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.112
Yeah, just let me call over
there, straighten this thing out.

34:52.199 --> 34:57.593
Yeah, so it's Tuesday.
Figure we'd agree Friday.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.319
If you don't got the money,
I'll go ahead and sell to him.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.629
The other buyer.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.436
Like I said,
he's up in Sleepy Eye.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.357
Hon, did... Did you...

35:28.720 --> 35:29.949
We talked about this.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.679
Yeah, didn't we
talk about this?

35:40.280 --> 35:41.315
What happened?

35:41.400 --> 35:43.073
Something with the car?
Did they find blood?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.077
No, no. This is
about the shop.

35:46.280 --> 35:50.638
Yeah? And we shook
on it. Bud and me.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.794
I wrote a check
for the down payment.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.070
And now I am hearing...

35:56.160 --> 35:58.470
Hon...
He said the check bounced.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.839
Insufficient funds. So
I call over there, and...

36:03.960 --> 36:06.474
We agreed, right?

36:06.800 --> 36:08.074
Well, we never...
I thought...

36:08.160 --> 36:11.073
You told me. But I never...

36:12.120 --> 36:13.952
Well, now there's
another buyer up in

36:14.040 --> 36:16.077
Sleepy Eye and he's
gonna get the shop.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.310
Well, he can't do that.
You shook on it.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.073
Yeah, but the check bounced!

36:21.640 --> 36:22.914
Insufficient funds.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.279
We talked about this.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.075
Well, if you mean you talked
and then I also talked,

36:31.160 --> 36:32.673
then, yeah, I guess,

36:34.200 --> 36:35.429
but not really sure you heard

36:35.520 --> 36:36.840
anything I said.
Yeah, I...

36:53.960 --> 36:55.553
Hon...

36:55.640 --> 36:59.838
I'm sorry. I am.
But you know, this course,

36:59.920 --> 37:02.230
the one I've been
telling ya about,

37:02.840 --> 37:05.958
Lifespring,
it's real important.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.435
Yeah. More important
than the shop?

37:09.760 --> 37:10.875
Maybe.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.270
I mean, to me.

37:14.640 --> 37:19.237
Well, I mean, you got to get
the money back. Right away.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.073
I mean, just call them
and tell them you're sorry,

37:22.160 --> 37:24.595
but you need the money.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.552
Ed, it's...
"Cause on Friday

37:26.680 --> 37:30.469
he sells to the fella up in
Sleepy Eye, and then we're

37:32.200 --> 37:33.190
screwed.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.629
Everything okay?

37:38.720 --> 37:39.915
I need the money back.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.071
For the course?
Sent that on already.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.389
I need it back!

37:43.800 --> 37:45.359
Ed says we could
lose the shop!

37:45.440 --> 37:48.239
Oh, Ed says.
Well, then, stop the presses.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.920
Come here. Sit down.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.030
I...

37:55.120 --> 37:58.272
Look in that mirror, hon.
Tell me what you see.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.114
I dunno. A girl?

38:02.640 --> 38:03.869
You get your period?

38:04.840 --> 38:06.911
Then what girl?
That's a woman.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.880
A strong, beautiful,
vibrant woman.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.031
And no man should be
able to tell you what to do.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.713
Not with your body
or your money.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.959
How much I been
paying you here?

38:16.640 --> 38:18.631
Six hundred a month.
And you been saving?

38:19.040 --> 38:20.792
Ed and I put away
one third every week

38:20.880 --> 38:22.075
minus the occasional...

38:22.160 --> 38:23.309
So, 2007

38:23.400 --> 38:24.993
And you gave me
five for the course.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.879
So that's two-and-a-half
months' savings. Your money.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.156
For you to spend
as you please.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.793
(SIGHS) But I get it.
It's what we do.

38:34.520 --> 38:39.151
We surrender our needs to the
needs of men to our great detriment.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.629
But no more.
Say it with me.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.599
No more.
No more. That's right.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.513
You're gonna go to Sioux Falls
and you're gonna take this course,

38:48.160 --> 38:52.358
and you're gonna be the best
Peggy Blumquist you can be,

38:52.440 --> 38:57.594
and no one's ever gonna tell
you how to live your life again.

I could make some coffee.

None for me. Thanks.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.200
Saw your car.
At the shop.

43:51.960 --> 43:55.112
Yeah. I slipped on some
ice on the way to work.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.989
My fault really. I was
going on about something.

43:59.080 --> 44:02.835
Ran right off the

No, I just...

I'm sorry.

I wanna be clear
about something.

I can help, but you
gotta be straight with me.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.354
Well, what...

If I check the car,
the interior,

44:44.280 --> 44:45.759
I'm not gonna find blood?

Oh, well, Ed hurt
his neck, but...

44:49.880 --> 44:51.598
That's why I got the...
No blood.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.433
You didn't fight,
did you, Ed?

44:55.520 --> 44:57.750
In the war.
No, sir.

4-F on account I got
the one kidney, so...

45:04.200 --> 45:06.635
There's a look a boy gets
when he's been shot.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.311
Or a landmine takes
off his legs.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.515
And he's laying there in
the mud, trying to get up,

45:14.360 --> 45:16.158
'cause he doesn't
feel it yet.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.714
I don't...

45:18.800 --> 45:21.314
hasn't caught up with
the reality, which is

45:22.520 --> 45:23.715
he's already dead.

could've happened to anyone.

made a mistake, you panicked,

but we're asking you to leave.

Is that true, Ed?

You're asking me to leave?

for the best, yeah.
