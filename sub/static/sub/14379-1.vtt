00:44.450 --> 00:47.383
Oh, isn't that
precious?

00:47.416 --> 00:51.383
Like two buttons
on a pink bunny.

00:51.416 --> 00:53.166
Aww!

00:53.200 --> 00:54.366
Ha ha ha!

00:54.400 --> 00:55.433
Dexter: Ahem!

00:55.466 --> 00:58.050
Hello, mother,
father. Ahem.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.133
Who, may I ask,
has eaten

01:00.166 --> 01:02.450
all of the
chocolate-covered
chocolate balls?

01:02.483 --> 01:04.283
Ooh, sorry, Dex.

01:04.316 --> 01:07.433
I gave the rest to
Dee Dee and her friend.

01:07.466 --> 01:09.466
Boyfriend.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.300
Boyfriend?

01:11.333 --> 01:13.300
La la la la la!

01:13.333 --> 01:14.266
Ha ha!

01:14.300 --> 01:16.233
I gotta see this.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.466
So do you, like, um...

01:18.000 --> 01:20.416
Think chocolate-covered
chocolate balls are made
with magic?

01:20.450 --> 01:23.300
This is going to be
so stupid.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.416
Boy: Actually, Dee Dee,
it's done by tempering.

01:25.450 --> 01:30.033
It's a process that
stabilizes the cocoa
butter crystals.

01:30.066 --> 01:34.000
You could say there's
a bit of science
in every bite.

01:34.033 --> 01:36.266
What?

01:42.216 --> 01:43.150
Well, Dee Dee,

01:43.183 --> 01:45.000
aren't you going
to introduce me?

01:45.033 --> 01:49.166
This is Beau,
the cutest boy
in school.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.100
And that is my
dorky brother Dexter.

01:52.133 --> 01:56.400
Well, it is
a pleasure to
meet you, Beau.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.466
Say, that was
quite an astute

01:59.000 --> 02:01.183
scientific type
of observation.

02:01.216 --> 02:03.083
I've always
loved science.

02:03.116 --> 02:05.050
Oh, yes.
Me, too!

02:05.083 --> 02:06.316
Science
is so cool.

02:06.350 --> 02:11.283
Uh, Dexter, don't
you have a wrench
to turn or something?

02:11.316 --> 02:14.183
Oh, yes.
I am working on

02:14.216 --> 02:16.000
a hydroflux
defibrillator.

02:16.033 --> 02:19.050
Hey, Beau,
perhaps you'd like
to check it out.

02:19.083 --> 02:23.166
Actually, Dexter,
we were just about
to watch

02:23.200 --> 02:25.200
<i>jelly Jerry's</i>
<i>jukebox jamboree.</i>

02:25.233 --> 02:27.383
Well, that sounds like
a cool television program.

02:27.416 --> 02:29.383
Beau, could you please
pass me the--

02:29.416 --> 02:35.300
I said<i>we,</i>
as in not you!

02:35.333 --> 02:38.016
Man on TV: Hey, kids,
this is jelly Jerry.

02:38.050 --> 02:42.000
So hold on to your
chocolate-covered
chocolate balls,

02:42.033 --> 02:46.216
and get ready
to jamboree!

02:46.250 --> 02:48.066
Hee hee!

02:48.383 --> 02:50.450
I, uh, thought you
could use a refill

02:50.483 --> 02:52.400
on your cranberry
juice, Beau.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.166
I'm ok. Thanks.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.166
It's cranberrific!

02:56.200 --> 02:57.316
Well, ok.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.016
I'll get it!

02:59.050 --> 03:00.250
Oh, Beau,
I am so sorry!

03:00.283 --> 03:01.483
Sorry, Beau! I...

03:02.016 --> 03:03.016
I didn't mean to.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.383
I just simply could
not contain myself.

03:04.416 --> 03:07.050
Uh, that's ok.
Uh, bathroom?

03:07.083 --> 03:09.233
Hey, thanks.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.083
[Door shuts]

03:11.116 --> 03:14.266
Why do you have to be
so stupid, Dee Dee?

03:14.300 --> 03:17.066
[Screaming]

03:18.366 --> 03:20.300
Beau: Ok, all cleaned up.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.116
Ahh!
Ahh!

03:25.216 --> 03:29.066
Wow! You like
Einstein, too?

03:29.100 --> 03:31.200
I've always dug
the big "e."

03:31.233 --> 03:32.100
Come on, Beau.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.333
Let's go
to the basement

03:33.366 --> 03:36.083
and play a g-a-m-e.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.133
Beau...

03:38.166 --> 03:41.250
Let's play
lollipop village.

03:41.283 --> 03:44.200
Ok, Beau,
you sit here.

03:44.233 --> 03:46.150
I'll go find
the game.

03:46.183 --> 03:48.033
Let's see...

03:48.066 --> 03:49.466
Fallopalopadee.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.050
Squiggle trip.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.333
Here it is!

03:54.366 --> 03:57.200
Oh, ha ha.
Do not mind me.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.350
I am just
looking for

03:58.383 --> 04:01.233
my gyroscopic
oscillator.

04:01.266 --> 04:03.016
Ah, here it is.

04:03.050 --> 04:06.033
Hey, Beau, you
might find this
interesting.

04:06.066 --> 04:11.016
Presenting
lollipop village.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.100
[Gasp]

04:19.466 --> 04:23.033
Now look what
you have done,
you stupid!

04:23.066 --> 04:26.216
It was your cockamamie
thingamabobbie!

04:26.250 --> 04:27.350
[Gasp]

04:27.383 --> 04:33.133
Maybe he needs
mouth-to-mouth
resusci-ma-tation.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.116
Well, go ahead.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.100
Maybe you
should do it.

04:37.133 --> 04:39.166
It is your fault!
You do it!

04:39.200 --> 04:40.216
Just do it!

04:40.250 --> 04:43.366
Ok! Ok!
I will do it.

04:45.283 --> 04:47.283
[Cough]

04:51.316 --> 04:53.183
Hey, kids.

04:53.216 --> 04:55.250
Is everything
all right?

04:55.283 --> 05:01.350
Uh, yeah. We're
just playing, uh,
emergency room.

05:01.383 --> 05:05.433
Play safe.

05:06.483 --> 05:09.066
[Beau coughing
and gasping]

05:09.100 --> 05:11.100
You're alive!

05:11.133 --> 05:13.316
Wh--what's happening?

05:13.350 --> 05:16.050
Dee Dee must have caused
the stabilizer

05:16.083 --> 05:18.233
to come--Beau?

05:23.100 --> 05:26.450
So, Beau, do you,
um, think, like, um,

05:26.483 --> 05:30.250
you'll ever get married?

05:30.283 --> 05:31.383
Um...

05:31.416 --> 05:32.316
Dexter!

05:32.350 --> 05:35.100
Ah, ha ha ha.
I thought, uh,

05:35.133 --> 05:38.050
maybe a beverage
you could use?

05:38.083 --> 05:39.250
Dexter, out!

05:39.283 --> 05:41.100
Ok. Come on, Beau.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.483
No way, Jorge.

05:43.016 --> 05:45.433
Dee Dee, look.
A unicorn.

05:45.466 --> 05:49.416
[Gasp] A unicorn!

05:49.450 --> 05:51.216
Unicorn?

05:51.250 --> 05:52.216
[Pounding on door]

05:52.250 --> 05:53.400
Which do you prefer,
Beau?

05:53.433 --> 05:56.250
The 1678, or this, uh,
double chrome number?

05:56.283 --> 05:58.283
I think someone's
knocking.

05:58.316 --> 06:02.050
Nothing.
I hear, uh, nothing.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.066
Oh, Dee Dee.
Hey, ha ha ha.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
We were just--

06:13.100 --> 06:16.166
ahem. Tea time!

06:47.083 --> 06:50.233
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya!

06:50.266 --> 06:52.250
Eeeh!

[Sobbing] Wait!

07:13.133 --> 07:15.116
Beau?
Beau?

07:15.150 --> 07:17.183
Get back! Get back!

07:17.216 --> 07:19.400
Stay away!

07:19.433 --> 07:21.216
Away!

07:21.250 --> 07:22.366
Beau?

07:22.400 --> 07:27.466
Aah!

07:28.483 --> 07:31.033
Well, he wasn't
that smart.

07:31.066 --> 07:34.200
Nor was he
that cute, either.

08:00.016 --> 08:00.366
Robot: Oh.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.133
Oh, excuse me, sir.

08:02.166 --> 08:05.416
I was just wondering
if you know where I can
find a sphygnometer.

08:05.450 --> 08:07.350
A sphygnometer?

08:07.383 --> 08:12.416
B sub level, room f,
drawer 620-049.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.133
Great. Thanks.

08:14.166 --> 08:15.350
No problem.

08:15.383 --> 08:18.400
[Robots chattering]

08:22.416 --> 08:24.133
Dexter: Wait.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.450
Wait!

08:25.483 --> 08:27.350
I'm coming down.

08:27.383 --> 08:28.316
I was first,

08:28.350 --> 08:30.183
but my task is
priority code "e."

08:30.216 --> 08:33.216
Well, mine is code "d,"
so you have to wait.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.183
Shh, shh, shh.

08:34.216 --> 08:35.466
Now, who's first?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.050
[All talking at once]

08:39.083 --> 08:41.050
Seeds are
in botany bay 20,

08:41.083 --> 08:44.466

08:51.083 --> 08:53.100
Thank you.

08:55.233 --> 08:56.450
Yeesh!

08:56.483 --> 08:59.250
Oh, so much
to remember.

08:59.283 --> 09:01.483
But that is why I
am building this:

09:02.016 --> 09:05.066
My over-engorged
super brainulator.

09:05.100 --> 09:08.466
It will remember
everything for me--
Dexter.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.300
Just one more knot
and she's operational.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.466
Whee!

09:14.000 --> 09:16.116
Dee Dee?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.383
[Clang]

09:17.416 --> 09:22.100
Uh, where am I?
Who am I?

[Echoing]
Anybody out there?

09:40.166 --> 09:42.450
Hi, Dexter!

09:43.450 --> 09:45.283
Are you talking to me?

09:45.316 --> 09:48.300
Well, your name's
Dexter, isn't it?

09:48.333 --> 09:52.033
Is it? Quite honestly,
I don't really remember.

09:52.066 --> 09:55.166
All I can recall is a
sharp pain in my skull,

09:55.200 --> 09:56.216
then blackness.

09:56.250 --> 10:00.000
And then I woke up
in this fantastic place.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.033
If you, strange being,

10:01.066 --> 10:03.333
can shed any light
on my circumstances,

10:03.366 --> 10:06.150
I would be forever
in your debt.

10:06.183 --> 10:11.483
You mean you don't remember
where you are or who you are?

10:12.016 --> 10:14.216
No. Can you help me?

10:14.250 --> 10:17.150
Oh, yeah. Sure.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.333
Here's how it is.

10:19.366 --> 10:23.433
Your name is

No.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.133
Well, it is.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.416
And my name
is queen Dee Dee,

10:29.450 --> 10:32.383
the almighty

10:32.416 --> 10:36.250
And this is our playroom,

10:36.283 --> 10:37.300
where we love to play.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.483
Come on, ducky.
Let's play.

10:40.016 --> 10:41.400
Whoa-hoo!

Uh, yeah.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.316
You know, I really
think it's starting
to come back to me now.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.366
Do you know what
happens next?

10:53.400 --> 10:57.166
I do not know anything
but the present right now.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.316
So, whatever you got.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.316
An independent film by...

11:08.466 --> 11:10.266
Psst, computer.

You are taping
all this, right?

11:12.466 --> 11:14.233
Computer:
Yes. But why?

11:14.266 --> 11:18.050
Look, all I know is Dexter
wants you to record him
doing some stuff,

11:18.083 --> 11:20.050
and then make me a copy.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.333
It's very top secret.

11:22.366 --> 11:24.383
Affirmative.
I understand.

11:24.416 --> 11:25.333
Shh!

11:25.366 --> 11:26.416
Oh, sorry.

11:26.450 --> 11:28.033
Shh!

11:28.066 --> 11:31.183
Yoo-hoo, queen Dee Dee,
your tea is getting cold.

11:31.216 --> 11:33.250
Ok. Coming, ducky.

11:35.283 --> 11:36.183
Ahh...

11:36.216 --> 11:38.483
So delicious,
queen Dee Dee.

11:39.016 --> 11:42.133
You make
the best tea ever.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.400
I know.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.150
Now it's time
to play dress up.

11:48.183 --> 11:50.250
Uh, d-d-dress up?

11:50.283 --> 11:53.366
Something tells me
I do not like that.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.316
Uh, how about suit up?

11:56.350 --> 11:58.266
You want to play
that instead?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.016
Suit up.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.416
Now, that seems like
something I would like.

12:02.450 --> 12:07.400
Yes. This is all beginning
to seem vaguely familiar.

12:07.433 --> 12:09.350
There, now.

12:09.383 --> 12:13.266
Don't you
look adorable!

12:16.333 --> 12:18.116
La la la la la la!

12:18.150 --> 12:19.466
Feels good, right?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.200
Like it's all starting
to come back to you, huh?

12:23.233 --> 12:25.450
Yeah. I think it is.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.183
You know what?

12:27.216 --> 12:30.466
We have a thing
that we like to do
when we are feeling good.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.483
We do?

12:34.266 --> 12:36.116
See how good
that feels?

12:36.150 --> 12:38.233
It is ok

doing in my laboratory?

13:28.133 --> 13:32.183
Ducky, that is
not how we speak
to queen Dee Dee.

13:41.466 --> 13:44.200
Oh, and before I go,
let me just say

13:44.233 --> 13:49.183
I'll always remember
our special day
of fun together, ducky.

13:49.216 --> 13:51.383
Why do you keep
calling me that?

13:51.416 --> 13:54.300
Bah! Stupid Dee Dee.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.033
Fun and frolic. Bah!

Dexter, but Dee Dee--

14:14.450 --> 14:16.033
no buts, computer!

14:16.066 --> 14:18.483
Memories like those
are terrible memories indeed.

14:19.016 --> 14:22.083
If that type of footage
got into the wrong hands,

14:22.116 --> 14:23.150

will not be made
a fool of.

15:39.366 --> 15:41.450
I shall dig deep into
the earth's crust...

15:41.483 --> 15:43.266
[Together]
To expand my scientific

15:43.300 --> 15:45.266
real estate and have

15:45.300 --> 15:47.433
the greatest laboratory ever!

16:10.083 --> 16:12.000
Ok, boys, let's go!

16:12.033 --> 16:15.050
Everything is color-coded

16:15.083 --> 16:16.400

go in the mezzanine,
not the foyer!

at me and says,
"goo goo boo boo."

And she says,
"boo boo goo
goo boo boo."

16:26.366 --> 16:31.133

I realized I was much
smarter than my parents.

16:39.183 --> 16:41.033

except that he'll be evil
and 6 years younger,

19:22.016 --> 19:23.200
so that when Dexter
is old and weak,

19:23.233 --> 19:24.400
the clone Dexter
won't be!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.300
keep it down
a little? Thanks.

19:33.333 --> 19:37.133
Oh, yeah, and since
you just blabbed
your entire plot,

I can tell you
it will not work.

is perfect!

Using your DNA,
I will clone my
own Dexter and--

19:45.350 --> 19:48.066
ah, you see,
here we have
our first dilemma.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.016
To produce
a clone of myself,

19:50.050 --> 19:51.466
you will need
a sample of my DNA,

19:52.000 --> 19:53.133
of which
you have none,

19:53.166 --> 19:56.450
thereby rendering
your diabolical plot
undiabolical.

19:56.483 --> 19:59.216
Can I please
have some DNA?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.016
No.
And you can forget

20:01.050 --> 20:02.250
about this hydrogen
accelerator.

20:02.283 --> 20:04.050
I had my lab
shielded against that

20:04.083 --> 20:05.300

you tried it.

cryogenic mechanism
would be much better.

have here?

20:11.050 --> 20:14.016
I can't believe you thought
you could get away with this!

20:14.050 --> 20:15.350
You must take me
for a fool!

Re-routing power
from the deflector array?

20:17.300 --> 20:21.083
Eh, heh heh, I guess
that is a little cliche.

20:21.116 --> 20:22.466
What I would
do is--
aha!

20:23.000 --> 20:24.300
There is your
problem here.

20:24.333 --> 20:27.016
You need to cross
these two detonators

20:27.050 --> 20:28.416
in order to achieve
the maximum

20:28.450 --> 20:30.083

reaction.

20:30.116 --> 20:31.150
Ha! This
won't work!

20:31.183 --> 20:33.366
You've got way
too many relays.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.116
You'll need far more
uranium extract

20:36.150 --> 20:37.366
to do any sort
of damage.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.083
What a mess!

20:40.266 --> 20:41.316
You've gotta
tighten these!

20:41.350 --> 20:43.366
And reinforce
these.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.050
Increase power!

20:45.083 --> 20:46.366
