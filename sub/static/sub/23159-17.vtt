WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:02.651
To the late, great Thomas Sullivan Magnum.

00:04.460 --> 00:07.588
- Stop yelling!
- I'm not yelling! I'm speaking loudly.

00:07.630 --> 00:09.097
You're yelling.

00:09.132 --> 00:12.465
Always did prefer your men
like your cologne, cheap and splashy.

00:12.502 --> 00:14.663
- You're not a member here.
- My wife is.

00:14.704 --> 00:16.934
You can put it on their accounts. Ta.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.373
Marrying the boss's niece has advantages.

00:19.409 --> 00:22.344
Anything you want or need,
you just give me a little buzz.

00:24.814 --> 00:26.475
Uncle Harry, what is going on?

00:26.516 --> 00:28.814
You and your new hubby are up the creek.

01:35.251 --> 01:40.086
Dearly beloved, we have come together
in the presence of God

01:40.123 --> 01:46.426
to witness and bless the joining of this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

01:46.929 --> 01:49.124
Would you join hands, please?

01:53.202 --> 01:56.035
Will you have this man to be your husband,

01:56.072 --> 01:59.769
to live together in the covenant of marriage?

01:59.809 --> 02:06.476
Will you love him, comfort him, honor
and keep him, in sickness and in health

02:06.516 --> 02:11.078
and, forsaking all others, be faithful
to him as long as you both shall live?

02:11.120 --> 02:12.246
I will.

02:18.494 --> 02:21.827
And will you have
this woman to be your wife,

02:21.864 --> 02:25.197
to live together in the covenant of marriage?

02:25.234 --> 02:31.400
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her, in sickness and in health

02:31.441 --> 02:36.401
and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her
as long as you both shall live?

02:36.446 --> 02:37.777
I will.

02:37.814 --> 02:39.145
The ring, please.

02:47.523 --> 02:52.051
Now that this man and this woman
have given themselves to each other,

02:52.095 --> 02:56.191
by solemn vow, by the joining of hands

02:56.232 --> 02:59.224
and by the giving and receiving of a ring,

02:59.268 --> 03:02.704
I pronounce that they are husband and wife.

03:03.372 --> 03:05.306
You may kiss the bride.

03:38.341 --> 03:41.469
I'm telling you, T.C.,
he's sick, he needs help.

03:41.511 --> 03:45.675
Needed help. In case you didn't notice,
the boy done said I do.

03:45.715 --> 03:48.513
I tried talking to him like a buddy.
Would he listen?

03:48.551 --> 03:51.543
He wouldn't listen to anybody.
I called him 30 times.

03:51.587 --> 03:53.817
Never returned one of my calls. Not one.

03:53.856 --> 03:59.886
Uh-huh. To the late, great Thomas
Sullivan Magnum. May he rest in peace.

03:59.929 --> 04:02.727
My God, Rick, how can you drink that swill?

04:02.765 --> 04:06.223
Malaria-infested Burmese swamp water
was more palatable.

04:06.269 --> 04:09.500
- Gee, Higgins, I kind of like it.
- That doesn't surprise me.

04:09.539 --> 04:13.373
Nothing about this soiree surprises me.

04:13.409 --> 04:18.176
Everything is so flawlessly vulgar.
Macaroni salad and plastic flowers.

04:18.214 --> 04:22.378
But then one can hardly expect
anything else from Harry MacKenzie.

04:22.418 --> 04:25.080
Hey, lighten up, this guy is worth millions.

04:25.121 --> 04:29.217
Clearly a blessed confirmation
that breeding and class cannot be bought.

04:29.258 --> 04:31.419
Thank the heavens.

04:31.460 --> 04:34.122
You know something, Higgins?
You're a snob.

04:34.163 --> 04:36.723
I prefer to think of myself as civilized.

04:36.766 --> 04:39.701
This is a class act, first class here.

04:42.605 --> 04:47.372
Plastic champagne glasses, I rest my case
and feel more confident than ever

04:47.410 --> 04:50.538
that Magnum will feel right at home
with his new in-laws.

04:51.214 --> 04:52.806
Wonderful.

05:03.259 --> 05:06.160
Tom...

05:06.195 --> 05:08.186
Marsha.

05:08.231 --> 05:11.029
Oh, Tom, Tom.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.659
Marsha.

05:12.702 --> 05:16.194
Uncle Harry, everything is perfect.
Daddy would be so proud.

05:16.239 --> 05:20.767
Honey, I promised my brother his little girl
would have the very best of everything.

05:20.810 --> 05:24.337
Ever since her daddy died,
she's been like my own little girl.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.678
I'd like to dance with her if you don't mind.

05:26.716 --> 05:29.844
- Sure, Mr. MacKenzie.
- Tom, please, call me Uncle Harry.

05:29.885 --> 05:31.716
OK, Uncle Harry.

05:31.754 --> 05:34.052
- Sure you don't mind?
- No, it's just...

05:34.090 --> 05:36.081
- Ready?
- Yes.

05:50.373 --> 05:53.865
It would appear you've made
my sister very happy.

05:53.909 --> 05:57.276
Well, I hope so. She's made me very happy.

05:57.313 --> 06:01.215
That's nice.
Marrying the boss's niece has advantages.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.947
- Oh, Andy...
- No, no, no. Andrew.

06:04.987 --> 06:06.978
Not Andy, Andrew.

06:07.023 --> 06:11.119
Look, Andrew,
I did not marry the boss's niece.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.991
I don't even work for your uncle.

06:13.029 --> 06:16.362
You will. You know my father died
building this company?

06:16.399 --> 06:19.391
MacKenzie Enterprises is a family business.

06:19.435 --> 06:22.962
- Always has been, always will be.
- I know.

06:23.005 --> 06:27.465
- So you think that you can just come in...
- My boys, scheming already?

06:27.510 --> 06:30.172
Trying to figure out how to throw
Uncle Harry out?

06:30.212 --> 06:32.737
I wouldn't count on it
for the next half-century.

06:32.782 --> 06:35.410
Don't count your chickens.
Nothing's for ever.

06:35.451 --> 06:38.079
- Hello, Grandmother.
- And don't pout.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.588
Your brother used to pout and it killed him.

06:40.623 --> 06:43.717
Heart stopped, just like that.
Bad for the ticker.

06:44.427 --> 06:48.761
Stand up, boy, you're slouching.
Bad for the liver.

06:49.298 --> 06:51.596
Come on, they're playing our song.

06:52.468 --> 06:54.766
- Bye.
- Nice boy.

06:55.671 --> 06:58.196
It's good to have a new face in the family.

07:00.710 --> 07:05.113
- Otto, they're here.
- Ja, ja, Greta. I am hurrying.

07:13.322 --> 07:15.313
Greta, Otto, what are you doing here?

07:15.358 --> 07:18.919
Your grandmother sent us
to make perfect your love nest.

07:20.363 --> 07:23.025
Greta and Otto work for
Grandmother MacKenzie.

07:23.065 --> 07:26.557
Otto, big Dummkopf,
said you would be coming at six.

07:26.602 --> 07:28.433
Six is what I was told.

07:28.471 --> 07:30.769
No matter. No matter.

07:30.806 --> 07:32.603
So very beautiful.

07:35.611 --> 07:37.442
And such a handsome husband.

07:39.849 --> 07:42.249
Me, I have Dummkopf. Take the bags inside.

07:42.284 --> 07:45.310
- Oh, thank you.
- Schnell, schnell.

07:45.354 --> 07:47.219
Oh, I'll get the door.

07:47.256 --> 07:49.247
Thank you very much.

07:51.961 --> 07:55.954
- This is Uncle Harry's wedding gift?
- Yes, good old Uncle Harry.

07:57.933 --> 08:00.128
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Uh?

08:00.169 --> 08:02.160
- The threshold.
- Ah.

08:14.683 --> 08:17.345
- Oh, isn't this lovely?
- Champagne.

08:17.386 --> 08:19.479
Oh, how nice.

08:22.425 --> 08:24.086
Ja. Gut.

08:24.126 --> 08:27.960
The bags are in the bedroom,
the first room on the left.

08:27.997 --> 08:32.263
Dinner is cooking,
champagne is cooling and...

08:32.301 --> 08:34.701
We are going.

08:34.736 --> 08:36.932
- Bye.
- Thanks.

08:37.773 --> 08:39.467
Bye-bye.

08:43.779 --> 08:45.770
I thought they would never leave.

08:46.649 --> 08:49.641
The threshold, don't you think
that was a bit much?

08:49.685 --> 08:52.813
- Isn't that how it's done?
- Sure. In 1947.

08:53.322 --> 08:55.347
Oh!

08:55.391 --> 08:58.724
Watch out! Oh, you big klutz!

08:58.761 --> 09:00.956
I didn't do anything. I was standing here.

09:00.996 --> 09:03.794
Do you have any idea
how much this dress cost?

09:03.833 --> 09:06.859
Hey, it was an accident. I'm sorry.

09:06.902 --> 09:10.030
I should have known, big body, little brain.

09:10.072 --> 09:14.236
- This is not gonna be easy.
- Brilliant deduction.

09:14.276 --> 09:18.975
Look, don't you think that we could try
to be a little understanding,

09:19.014 --> 09:21.244
otherwise we'll be at each other's throat?

09:21.283 --> 09:24.411
- Don't you threaten me.
- That is not a threat.

09:24.453 --> 09:27.945
- Stop yelling!
- I'm not yelling! I'm speaking loudly!

09:27.990 --> 09:31.983
- You're yelling!
- Hey, will you two knock it off?

09:32.027 --> 09:34.495
This is a nice neighborhood.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.863
You two are beginning to sound
like you actually are married.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.891
I'd rather be dead.

09:52.147 --> 09:55.173
Primo stuff, 22 bucks a case.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.851
It smells like a poker game in here.

09:59.889 --> 10:03.620
- Harry, you're getting ash all over the floor.
- Relax, it's a rental.

10:03.659 --> 10:06.992
I have to live here.
I'd prefer it didn't look like a frat house.

10:07.029 --> 10:09.520
Look, you and I decided
on this plan together.

10:09.565 --> 10:13.797
You decided, and for some reason,
which still escapes me, I accepted.

10:13.836 --> 10:15.667
For the company, honey.

10:15.704 --> 10:20.164
I married that bozo Bruce for love.
This isn't going to work any better than that.

10:20.209 --> 10:23.303
Au contraire.
Andy went for it, hook, line and sinker.

10:24.713 --> 10:28.046
And now, in the spirit of nepotism
that made this country great,

10:28.083 --> 10:31.814
I'm gonna make my new nephew-in-law
a vice president of the company,

10:31.854 --> 10:34.687
in charge of... plant operations.

10:35.457 --> 10:39.291
He can look into every nook and cranny
and nobody'll get suspicious.

10:39.328 --> 10:44.561
Right. If Andrew buys this... situation,
then it's a good cover.

10:45.501 --> 10:47.366
When do you think he'll make a move?

10:47.403 --> 10:49.166
If I knew that, I wouldn't need you.

10:51.941 --> 10:55.775
Once I discovered the losses,
I analyzed our records for nearly a year.

10:55.811 --> 10:58.336
There's been a loss every month,
except this one.

10:58.380 --> 11:02.043
I've got almost $8 million worth of computers
in that warehouse

11:02.084 --> 11:03.847
and Andy's gonna go for it

11:03.886 --> 11:08.414
and when he does, I'm gonna catch
that snake with his hand in the cookie jar.

11:08.457 --> 11:10.049
If he does it.

11:11.126 --> 11:15.392
You start tomorrow. Snoop around
the company. Use your private eye contacts.

11:15.431 --> 11:17.399
- Private investigator.
- Who cares?

11:17.433 --> 11:21.665
Just find out where he's gonna fence that stuff
and, more importantly, when.

11:21.704 --> 11:23.695
Now, listen, you two. Andy is no dummy.

11:23.739 --> 11:28.438
He'll keep his eyes on you, so I want you
to be happily married 24 hours a day.

11:28.477 --> 11:30.411
That shouldn't be too hard.

11:31.246 --> 11:34.374
- Speak for yourself.
- Marsha, put a lid on it.

11:37.519 --> 11:41.751
I'm beat. Which bedroom do you want?

11:41.790 --> 11:44.315
There's only one bedroom, mine.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.828
Wait. Where am I supposed to sleep?

11:46.862 --> 11:49.524
Anywhere you like
except the bedroom or bathroom.

11:49.565 --> 11:54.264
Hey, look, maybe we both ought to decide
who's going to sleep where,

11:54.303 --> 11:56.897
draw up a schedule, take turns.

11:56.939 --> 12:00.431
Sort of domestic democracy,
that's fair, right?

12:46.888 --> 12:48.719
Good morning.

12:54.796 --> 12:56.457
You need a shave.

12:57.532 --> 13:00.000
I also need a sink.

13:00.034 --> 13:02.195
I think I saw one in the kitchen.

13:19.421 --> 13:21.412
Agh! Oh!

13:25.927 --> 13:27.758
Fascinating.

13:30.632 --> 13:32.793
Is it a masculine morning ritual?

13:32.834 --> 13:37.237
It's called shaving in the sink
with a toaster for a mirror. You oughta try it.

13:37.272 --> 13:39.137
What on earth for?

13:40.608 --> 13:43.202
Look, you've cut yourself, clumsy.

13:43.912 --> 13:48.110
- I'm lucky I didn't slit my throat.
- We're due at the club at nine for breakfast.

13:48.149 --> 13:51.482
The office at ten. Dress.
I want to leave in 15 minutes.

13:51.519 --> 13:53.384
Don't you ever say please?

14:06.601 --> 14:07.966
Would you hurry up?

14:08.002 --> 14:10.596
Could be worse.
We could really be married.

14:10.638 --> 14:12.799
We're not.

14:12.841 --> 14:16.937
You know, I sort of got the idea
that you've got a thing about marriage.

14:16.978 --> 14:20.641
The only problem I have with marriage
is the man who comes with the deal.

14:20.682 --> 14:21.944
Oh.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.851
I grew up in a family full of men.

14:25.753 --> 14:28.745
I washed them,
I fed them and I dressed them.

14:28.790 --> 14:32.453
I escaped by marrying a man
who was supposedly full grown.

14:32.494 --> 14:33.859
Bruce the bozo.

14:33.895 --> 14:37.262
I ended up washing,
feeding and dressing him too.

14:37.298 --> 14:39.232
Let me do that.

14:41.035 --> 14:44.163
Now I work almost entirely with men.

14:44.205 --> 14:46.969
Most of them act like they're about four.

14:47.008 --> 14:51.411
If I'm not careful, they'll have me
taking care of them too.

14:51.446 --> 14:54.609
So I decided there's only one person
I'm going to take care of.

14:54.649 --> 14:56.810
- Let me guess, you.
- Me.

14:59.954 --> 15:03.321
Now, amazing what a shower
and a shave will do for a man.

15:03.358 --> 15:06.122
A cold shower. We ran out of hot water.

15:07.128 --> 15:09.426
We are late, Mr. Magnum.

15:09.464 --> 15:12.661
Come on. As long as
we're pretending to be married,

15:12.700 --> 15:15.533
don't you think we ought to
be on a first-name basis?

15:15.570 --> 15:19.666
Maybe we can call each other
sweetheart or honey once in a while.

15:28.883 --> 15:30.817
Rico, whoa.

15:30.852 --> 15:32.410
Rico!

15:32.453 --> 15:35.945
Cool it with the buzz saw, will you?
No more blended drinks.

15:38.693 --> 15:41.821
There's something immoral
about gin fizzes at nine in the morning.

15:41.863 --> 15:46.527
- This is an outrage.
- No, Higgins. If you were inside my head...

15:46.568 --> 15:49.901
What an extraordinarily depressing thought.

15:49.938 --> 15:52.236
- What's the problem?
- Problems, plural.

15:52.273 --> 15:56.175
First there's a car parked
in my space, a Jaguar, gold.

15:57.178 --> 16:02.548
And the Ornithological Society's monthly
breakfast is scheduled for this morning...

16:02.584 --> 16:04.575
in the rainbow room.

16:04.619 --> 16:07.417
Another group
has forced its way into the room.

16:09.457 --> 16:14.394
Stop bobbing your head like a car ornament
and tell me who's responsible for this.

16:14.429 --> 16:17.921
Hi, Rick. Hi, Higgins. Could you send someone
to the rainbow room?

16:17.966 --> 16:20.833
- We're ready to order.
- Order, in the rainbow room?

16:20.868 --> 16:24.031
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You're not a member.

16:24.072 --> 16:26.370
That's right, but my wife is.

16:27.408 --> 16:31.504
So's my uncle-in-law, my brother-in-law
and my grandmother-in-law.

16:31.546 --> 16:36.176
So, until I'm a full-fledged member,
you can put it on their accounts. Ta.

16:41.255 --> 16:45.555
- I don't believe it.
- Sit down and button your trap, Andrew.

16:45.593 --> 16:48.892
I will not, Grandmother.
Somebody has to put his foot down.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.693
His foot?

16:50.732 --> 16:53.030
That is just a figure of speech, Marsha.

16:53.067 --> 16:55.865
Don't start playing sexual politics, OK?

16:55.903 --> 16:59.566
Andrew, I forbid you to use that word
in the presence of ladies.

16:59.607 --> 17:00.972
Or a gentleman.

17:01.009 --> 17:06.810
Gentleman? Oh, oh, oh. I have done
some checking up on this gentleman.

17:06.848 --> 17:10.807
- Andrew, he is my husband.
- That's hardly a stellar recommendation.

17:10.852 --> 17:14.413
That's just like you, Andrew.
You always were a little sneak.

17:14.454 --> 17:18.824
- Now, now, Andy's got a perfect right...
- It's Andrew, Uncle Harry.

17:18.859 --> 17:22.193
- And don't patronize me.
- Shut up, boys.

17:22.230 --> 17:25.393
- The men in this family are such whiners.
- Mother...

17:25.433 --> 17:27.731
New blood's the answer.

17:27.769 --> 17:31.500
- Fresh genes.
- Andrew, you are being petty.

17:31.539 --> 17:35.031
I'm being responsible
to this business and this family.

17:35.076 --> 17:39.445
Mr. Magnum doesn't seem to know anything
about business or responsibility.

17:39.480 --> 17:44.179
I'm sure he's a fast learner.
Aren't you a fast learner, Timothy?

17:44.218 --> 17:48.086
- It's Thomas, Grandmother.
- Thomas? Thomas who?

17:48.122 --> 17:50.420
Thomas Magnum,

17:50.458 --> 17:53.950
whose naval career was destroyed
when he resigned his commission,

17:53.995 --> 17:56.828
who has drifted
ever since he arrived in the islands

17:56.864 --> 18:00.356
and done nothing except
live off the largesse of Robin Masters

18:00.401 --> 18:03.097
and who plays at being
a second-rate private eye.

18:03.137 --> 18:04.365
Private investigator.

18:04.405 --> 18:07.772
Basically, a guy who likes a fast buck
and a quick thrill.

18:07.809 --> 18:11.973
But you always did prefer your men
like your cologne, cheap and splashy.

18:12.013 --> 18:14.777
- Andrew!
- Pig!

18:14.816 --> 18:19.150
- Idiot.
- Now, shut up, the both of you. Sit down.

18:19.821 --> 18:23.552
Sorry, Tom, they're like oil and water,
always were, always will be.

18:23.591 --> 18:28.153
Uncle Harry, you cannot allow
this beach bum to become a vice president.

18:28.196 --> 18:30.187
- Beach bum?
- Andrew!

18:30.231 --> 18:34.668
- Timothy's a member of the family.
- He's not a member of my family.

18:34.702 --> 18:39.833
I wouldn't let him be a janitor at MacKenzie,
much less a vice president.

18:56.057 --> 18:58.355
- Mr. Magnum?
- Huh?

18:58.392 --> 19:03.091
You're already here.
I'm Miss Lodato, your secretary.

19:03.131 --> 19:04.792
Hi.

19:04.832 --> 19:06.493
You took me by surprise.

19:07.568 --> 19:11.060
Oh, I'm sorry. This is all kind of new to me.

19:11.105 --> 19:14.233
That's what I'm here for,
to show you the ropes.

19:15.877 --> 19:22.043
And anything you want or need,
you just give me a little buzz.

19:22.817 --> 19:25.342
- Well, thanks, Miss...?
- Lodato.

19:25.820 --> 19:29.847
- But I prefer to be called Mary Jane.
- Thank you.

19:31.926 --> 19:33.621
Thank you.

19:33.661 --> 19:36.186
Thank you, Miss Lodato.

19:43.371 --> 19:47.137
I see you've met Mary Jane.
She's cute, isn't she?

19:47.175 --> 19:50.303
Look but don't touch. Company policy.

19:50.344 --> 19:52.642
Besides, you are married, remember that?

19:52.680 --> 19:54.671
It's always on my mind.

19:55.850 --> 19:58.683
As soon as you're settled in,
start checking around.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.586
The sooner we can finish
with this charade, the better.

20:01.622 --> 20:04.921
- You got it, boss.
- No.8 is where the inventory is stored.

20:04.959 --> 20:07.120
Check the security system there first.

20:07.161 --> 20:09.152
- Right.
- And be careful.

20:09.197 --> 20:12.223
After this morning,
Andrew is bound to be suspicious.

20:12.266 --> 20:15.099
Oh, you do care.

20:17.505 --> 20:20.963
<i>When I write my book on
how to be an ace private investigator,</i>

20:21.008 --> 20:23.841
<i>one of the first chapters
will be on family squabbles.</i>

20:23.878 --> 20:28.406
<i>There's a thousand variations but
the MacKenzies were a classic combination</i>

20:28.449 --> 20:32.977
<i>of money, power and sibling rivalry.
A pretty potent mix.</i>

20:33.020 --> 20:37.116
<i>The nice thing about cases like these,
though, was how easily they unraveled</i>

20:37.158 --> 20:39.319
<i>once you find the right thread to pull</i>.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.763
<i>Nine times out of ten, everything boiled down
to ruffled feathers and hot air.</i>

20:43.798 --> 20:45.595
<i>That's why Uncle Harry's hot air</i>

20:45.633 --> 20:48.761
<i>and Andrew's ruffled feathers
didn't concern me too much.</i>

20:48.803 --> 20:52.899
<i>With a little luck, I figured I'd have
everyone kissing, making up</i>

20:52.940 --> 20:55.704
<i>and maybe even living happily ever after</i>.

21:45.475 --> 21:47.773
There, there, Mr. Magnum.

21:49.045 --> 21:51.570
Now, don't move.

21:51.615 --> 21:54.083
That's right.

21:54.117 --> 21:56.108
Just relax.

22:00.290 --> 22:04.021
No... You mustn't do that.

22:08.365 --> 22:10.356
Such a big bump.

22:11.201 --> 22:13.362
The pillow should be under his feet.

22:13.403 --> 22:15.963
His head needs more blood than his big toe.

22:17.841 --> 22:19.832
Excuse me.

22:23.513 --> 22:27.244
Congratulations. In just three hours,
you have ruined everything.

22:27.284 --> 22:30.412
- Ruined everything?
- If you weren't so obvious about it...

22:30.453 --> 22:34.321
- Obvious? Wait a minute...
- You've blown our cover because of it.

22:34.357 --> 22:38.225
Fine. If that's the case,
then we can stop playing house,

22:38.261 --> 22:40.422
I can go back to being a private detective,

22:40.463 --> 22:44.729
which is exactly what I should
have been in the first place. Uhh.

22:46.503 --> 22:49.563
Let me see. Let me see.

22:53.810 --> 22:58.213
If you're going to keep shouting,
this is gonna get worse, so lie down.

22:58.248 --> 23:00.512
Lie down.

23:05.522 --> 23:07.513
I didn't realize.

23:09.693 --> 23:11.684
Is that better?

23:14.998 --> 23:19.094
Well, at least this bump tells us
we're on the right track, doesn't it?

23:21.871 --> 23:26.399
And you're wrong.
Our cover isn't exactly blown.

23:27.210 --> 23:29.542
I'm wrong? I didn't say that. You said that.

23:29.579 --> 23:32.707
I think it's even more important now
that we protect it,

23:32.749 --> 23:36.583
so that you can continue
with this investigation.

23:39.222 --> 23:41.520
What's wrong?

23:41.558 --> 23:44.686
Nothing. I was wondering
what you were planning on doing.

23:44.728 --> 23:47.492
- Besides just lying here.
- I'm not just lying here.

23:47.530 --> 23:50.431
A good private investigator's
always doing something.

23:50.467 --> 23:52.833
Such as?

23:56.106 --> 23:58.370
Yes?

23:58.408 --> 24:00.535
- It's Rick.
- Ah.

24:00.577 --> 24:04.308
See? Always doing something.

24:04.347 --> 24:06.338
Yeah, Rick.

24:06.383 --> 24:08.442
Great. What have you got?

24:10.086 --> 24:13.214
Good. Listen, can you and T.C.
come over tonight about seven?

24:13.256 --> 24:16.748
Yeah, bring some beer
and some chips. OK.

24:19.262 --> 24:23.358
- They're coming to our house tonight?
- Rick's got something for us.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.631
Well, I think you could have asked me first.

24:26.669 --> 24:29.194
You know,
Uncle Harry ought to be there too...

24:29.239 --> 24:31.867
Checked with you first? What about?

24:34.010 --> 24:38.140
- What's wrong now?
- Nothing. Nothing.

24:38.181 --> 24:41.309
I just hope we have enough for five.

24:45.555 --> 24:46.715
Enough what?

24:49.492 --> 24:51.483
Here you are.

24:52.362 --> 24:56.765
Now, this isn't exactly French
but there is some white wine in it...

24:57.600 --> 24:59.591
somewhere.

25:03.339 --> 25:05.705
Now, don't be polite. Go ahead and eat.

25:26.863 --> 25:33.860
Um, I hate to mix business with pleasure but
Tom tells me you came up with something.

25:33.903 --> 25:38.465
Yeah, there's this guy Ice Pick, tells me
that someone's been looking for a buyer

25:38.508 --> 25:40.669
with big bucks to handle a computer deal.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.905
That's got to be our stuff. I'll bet my life.

25:42.946 --> 25:46.279
That's a good bet. I kept digging.
I came up with a name.

25:47.350 --> 25:48.339
Mm.

25:48.384 --> 25:51.012
- Andy MacKenzie.
- I knew it.

25:51.554 --> 25:53.215
- Any buyers?
- Not yet.

25:53.256 --> 25:57.215
Then we'll provide one. Do you think
Ice Pick can set up a buy with Andy

25:57.260 --> 25:59.251
and a rich criminal from the mainland?

25:59.295 --> 26:01.559
Yeah, he could set it up for a price.

26:01.598 --> 26:05.090
That's it. There's our sting.
We'll set up the fake buy.

26:05.135 --> 26:07.899
Get Andy to tip his hand
and we catch him in the act.

26:07.937 --> 26:09.734
- Could work.
- It's got to work.

26:09.772 --> 26:12.764
That's the only way
I'm gonna get that sneaky twerp.

26:12.809 --> 26:18.714
Of course, we need one or two persons
who could pose as the buyers.

26:18.748 --> 26:22.707
Wait a minute, before you even consider
a bad idea, you can count us out.

26:22.752 --> 26:26.916
Hey, come on! I never even mentioned
you guys. Of course it's not a bad idea.

26:26.956 --> 26:29.083
It's worse than bad. It's terrible.

26:29.626 --> 26:34.120
Nothing personal but we've been down
the road too many times before with Thomas.

26:34.164 --> 26:38.123
So I thank you for the dinner
but we've got to go.

26:38.168 --> 26:41.296
Suppose I told you I'd pay you
1,000 big ones for the job?

26:43.006 --> 26:44.837
1,000 apiece that is.

26:49.212 --> 26:52.204
500 in front and 500 when the job's finished.

26:58.588 --> 27:00.886
Now, if that's all settled...

27:02.158 --> 27:04.786
how about some more casserole?

27:18.608 --> 27:20.269
Hi.

27:21.277 --> 27:25.043
It's the original Gunga Din,
just started. Grab a seat.

27:30.987 --> 27:32.978
I can barely hear it.

27:34.624 --> 27:37.821
That way I won't hear it at all,
which is the idea.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.728
- Bad idea.
- I want to go to sleep.

27:41.764 --> 27:44.232
So go to sleep.

27:44.267 --> 27:46.258
I plan to.

27:46.302 --> 27:48.634
- Wait a minute. Give me that.
- No.

27:48.671 --> 27:50.662
I need to sleep.

27:59.616 --> 28:01.914
What are you doing? What are you doing?

28:02.852 --> 28:04.843
You kissed me.

28:04.887 --> 28:10.052
I... kissed you? Oh! That's typically male.
Why would I want to kiss you?

28:10.927 --> 28:13.919
I don't know
but it's nothing to get upset about.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.863
I'm... not upset.

28:15.898 --> 28:22.394
Me either. As a matter of fact,
I kind of enjoyed it.

28:22.438 --> 28:24.269
Typically male, I guess.

28:50.933 --> 28:55.029
It's all set for dawn. Rick and T.C.
are gonna drive up in the truck.

28:55.071 --> 28:59.565
Andrew apparently has
someone on the gate to let them in.

29:01.878 --> 29:06.747
You couldn't hit the broad side
of a barn. That's 300 you owe me.

29:06.783 --> 29:09.251
Now you putt first this time.

29:09.285 --> 29:11.276
I'll be in the back of the truck.

29:11.321 --> 29:13.755
I'll squash Andy like a bug on a windshield.

29:13.790 --> 29:16.315
What am I supposed to be doing, my nails?

29:16.359 --> 29:20.022
You stay out of this. After what Andy's done,
we can't be too careful.

29:20.063 --> 29:24.056
I don't care. I'm vice president
of this company. I'm going with you.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.658
No, you're not.

29:26.502 --> 29:28.493
It could be dangerous.

29:34.043 --> 29:37.342
And you're both immune
because you're men, right?

29:37.380 --> 29:39.678
You stop speeding bullets
with your bare hands

29:39.716 --> 29:43.083
and leap tall buildings
with a single bound, that sort of thing?

29:43.119 --> 29:45.986
You're beginning
to sound like your grandmother.

29:46.022 --> 29:48.115
That's fine with me.

29:51.794 --> 29:56.197
Being married to her would give
a whole new meaning to the word divorce.

30:00.370 --> 30:05.603
That's 400 you owe me.
I got to go lie to a banker.

30:05.641 --> 30:08.906
I'll talk to accounting
about deducting 400 from your salary.

30:08.945 --> 30:10.776
Well...

30:26.095 --> 30:29.360
<i>Someone once said you are what you eat</i>.

30:29.399 --> 30:33.062
<i>Now, that's true but I also figure
you are where you live too.</i>

30:33.102 --> 30:35.866
<i>There's a lot to the old adage,
"Home, sweet home."</i>

30:35.905 --> 30:38.897
<i>It's comfortable, familiar, secure,</i>

30:38.941 --> 30:42.206
<i>sort of like a good pair of shoes
that really fit.</i>

30:42.245 --> 30:46.079
<i>That's why a couple days in the love nest
started driving me up the walls.</i>

30:46.115 --> 30:51.178
<i>It just wasn't me. So I figured I'd sneak off
and have a couple of hours to myself,</i>

30:51.220 --> 30:54.053
<i>a little domestic R&R, totally alone</i>.

30:54.090 --> 30:57.890
<i>- Touchdown, Southern Call.
- Except for the SC-Notre Dame game.</i>

31:00.696 --> 31:05.531
Higgins, look, I didn't mean to bother you.
Look, I can explain everything.

31:05.568 --> 31:09.470
It's not Mr. Higgins but don't let that
keep you from explaining.

31:09.505 --> 31:12.030
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?

31:12.074 --> 31:16.477
Well, since you took our car, I took a cab.

31:17.480 --> 31:23.146
And after calling Rick and T.C.
and every disreputable gin mill in Honolulu,

31:23.186 --> 31:25.347
that left... this.

31:25.388 --> 31:29.051
Then I simply told Mr. Higgins
I was looking for my husband.

31:29.091 --> 31:32.959
You woke him up?
Wait a minute. I am not your husband.

31:32.995 --> 31:36.123
He was absolutely livid
that you had broken in here

31:36.165 --> 31:39.396
but we both decided
I should take care of the matter.

31:39.435 --> 31:42.370
- How could you do this?
- Do what?

31:42.405 --> 31:45.670
How could you be so incredibly insensitive?

31:45.708 --> 31:49.371
I mean, I wake up in the middle
of the night and you're gone.

31:49.412 --> 31:53.508
There's no note,
no phone call, just an empty house.

31:53.549 --> 31:57.576
I couldn't sleep and there was
a replay of the football game on cable, so...

31:57.620 --> 32:00.555
So? So... you just walked out?

32:00.590 --> 32:03.058
You make it sound like I abandoned you.

32:03.092 --> 32:06.528
- Well, what do you call it?
- I don't call it anything.

32:07.530 --> 32:12.593
No, of course not. And you can just
come and go whenever you please.

32:12.635 --> 32:18.301
Marsha, look, you can come and go
whenever you please too.

32:18.341 --> 32:21.333
Day or night, around the clock, I don't care.

32:23.613 --> 32:27.379
Well, I mean I do care,
sort of, in the right way.

32:28.317 --> 32:30.478
I mean, we're in this together.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.351
Yes and it's not over yet.

32:32.388 --> 32:37.451
In case you've forgotten,
you work for me, us, 24 hours a day.

32:37.493 --> 32:40.985
And since we are meeting
Rick and T.C. in just a few hours,

32:41.030 --> 32:42.520
I suggest we get some rest.

32:42.565 --> 32:45.090
You're not actually gonna eat that?

32:46.035 --> 32:48.503
Well, yeah, actually, I was.

32:48.538 --> 32:54.204
Rancid, decaying animal flesh with
harmful chemicals and additives, that's terrible.

32:54.243 --> 32:56.234
Awful.

32:59.181 --> 33:02.309
I'll fix you something good
when we get home.

33:03.686 --> 33:06.280
Eggs Romanoff, that's what I'll make.

33:06.322 --> 33:09.985
That's got caviar
and capers and green onions.

33:10.026 --> 33:13.689
Or maybe that's red onions.
I don't know, whatever.

33:13.729 --> 33:18.132
I've never made it before
but the recipe sounds really good...

33:22.071 --> 33:24.938
This is the last time
you pick a disguise for me.

33:24.974 --> 33:29.343
But it is perfect, Orville. I am representing
oil money from the Sheik of Yahoo

33:29.378 --> 33:30.868
and you're his son.

33:30.913 --> 33:33.814
If I'm the son of a sheik,
how come I'm driving a truck?

33:33.849 --> 33:36.841
If anybody asks, blame OPEC.

33:39.555 --> 33:42.023
Tom, it's Rick. How's it going back there?

33:42.792 --> 33:45.818
I'm bouncing off the walls, Rick.
Can you take it easy?

33:49.098 --> 33:51.032
How's Marsha?

33:53.970 --> 33:56.131
Having the time of her life.

33:58.774 --> 34:01.368
All right, we'll be there in five minutes.

34:03.212 --> 34:05.737
Look, why don't you sit down?

34:05.781 --> 34:07.772
You're not going to get dirty.

34:08.851 --> 34:10.842
No, I'll stand up.

34:21.831 --> 34:23.822
Agh! Oh!

34:25.501 --> 34:27.661
I think we're here.

34:29.105 --> 34:31.572
Thomas, we're here. We don't see nothing.

34:32.440 --> 34:36.434
He's probably inside, Rick.
You go ahead, we'll follow.

34:36.478 --> 34:41.576
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm all right. I'm all right.

34:50.826 --> 34:53.293
- Rick! Rick!
- What?

34:53.329 --> 34:56.161
Better come down here. Something's wrong.

35:04.206 --> 35:06.731
- It's empty.
- It sure as hell is.

35:12.348 --> 35:15.476
We've been hoping you guys
would show up for the rest.

35:15.518 --> 35:18.009
- The rest?
- Wait. There's some mistake.

35:18.054 --> 35:22.423
Sure as hell been a mistake,
buddy boy, and it's yours... and his.

35:25.227 --> 35:28.355
I knew it. I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

35:28.397 --> 35:31.730
- What are you doing here?
- I was about to ask you the same thing.

35:31.767 --> 35:34.497
Uncle Harry, what is going on?

35:34.537 --> 35:38.029
It looks like you and your new hubby
are up the proverbial creek,

35:38.074 --> 35:40.099
without a paddle.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.133
Take 'em away, boys.

35:46.298 --> 35:51.235
- You really did it this time, Thomas.
- I told you, if you'd just let me explain.

35:51.269 --> 35:53.260
- Don't explain.
- Forget it, Thomas.

35:53.305 --> 35:55.466
It looks worse than it is.

35:55.507 --> 35:57.338
How could it look any worse?

35:57.376 --> 36:00.641
We're in jail looking at two to ten
for grand theft.

36:00.679 --> 36:02.909
I told you getting married was a big mistake.

36:02.948 --> 36:05.246
Ah! But that's the point, see?

36:05.283 --> 36:09.117
At least one of them, see?
I didn't actually get married.

36:09.154 --> 36:10.951
Well, I did but not really.

36:10.989 --> 36:14.322
Getting married is like getting pregnant,
you do or you don't.

36:14.359 --> 36:17.851
It's real simple, Rick,
if you'll just let me explain.

36:17.896 --> 36:22.162
Marsha discovered somebody stealing
from the company but she didn't know who.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.964
Now, Uncle Harry knew,
because he's the bad guy

36:25.003 --> 36:27.665
but he pointed the finger at Andrew

36:27.706 --> 36:30.174
and then he hired me
to come in and catch him

36:30.208 --> 36:35.407
but he set up this whole sting thing
to make it look like I ripped off the company.

36:35.447 --> 36:39.713
It's pretty clever, huh? And it almost
worked too, except that I figured it out

36:39.751 --> 36:43.687
and that's when Andrew, Marsha
and I came up with this idea

36:43.722 --> 36:46.247
about a sting on a sting,

36:46.291 --> 36:49.954
which meant we had to let
Harry's sting seem to work,

36:49.995 --> 36:52.589
so that we could sting him.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.393
And it worked.

36:56.435 --> 36:58.403
What worked?

36:58.904 --> 37:03.000
In case you haven't noticed, genius,
we're the ones that are in jail.

37:03.041 --> 37:06.533
The only thing we have done wrong
is be dumb enough to listen to you.

37:06.578 --> 37:09.513
Relax, guys, we're gonna
get out of here real soon.

37:09.548 --> 37:14.247
Yeah... well, real soon
better come real quick.

37:14.286 --> 37:20.384
Don't tell me. It's the city jail thespians
doing a scene from Riot In Cell Block 11.

37:20.425 --> 37:23.758
The final resting place
after a sordid life of crime.

37:23.795 --> 37:27.822
- Higgins, there's been a mistake.
- His. You got to get us out of here.

37:27.866 --> 37:31.165
That's easier said than done.
Bail has been denied.

37:31.203 --> 37:34.104
- Denied?
- Relax, guys.

37:34.139 --> 37:37.939
He's not in on the plan.
Andrew explained everything to the DA.

37:37.976 --> 37:39.944
We're gonna be here forever.

37:39.978 --> 37:45.075
They're probably letting Marsha out right now.
Trust me. It's all part of the plan.

37:45.116 --> 37:48.244
- We had to give Uncle Harry some time.
- To do what?

37:48.286 --> 37:50.880
To get away. Or think
that he was getting away.

37:50.922 --> 37:53.447
How extraordinarily bizarre, Magnum.

37:53.492 --> 37:56.620
You cannot walk into
the middle of something like this

37:56.661 --> 37:59.255
and expect to understand it.
If you let me explain.

37:59.297 --> 38:00.730
Shut up!

38:00.765 --> 38:03.757
Thomas, we got here
as quickly as we could.

38:03.802 --> 38:06.396
No problem, we're right on schedule.
How'd it go?

38:06.438 --> 38:10.841
He didn't suspect a thing. They had
the truck out an hour before you got there.

38:10.876 --> 38:12.810
We followed him to pier 40.

38:12.844 --> 38:15.608
- Thomas, what is going on?
- I'll explain on the way.

38:15.647 --> 38:20.050
- Explain on the way? Forget it.
- We ain't going nowhere with you.

38:20.886 --> 38:22.877
OK, if that's the way you feel.

38:24.823 --> 38:28.315
You see that?
He didn't know what to do.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.885
Of course, because he knew
he couldn't do a thing.

38:30.929 --> 38:32.863
Hey! Ha!

38:32.898 --> 38:36.026
Look here, man, I'm starving.
Let's go get some lunch.

38:36.067 --> 38:37.898
Good idea.

38:41.506 --> 38:44.441
It's locked. It's locked!

38:44.476 --> 38:46.569
- Guard!
- Hey! Yoo-hoo!

38:46.611 --> 38:47.771
Hey, guard, help!

38:47.812 --> 38:51.908
Hey, somebody come back here!
Why did you pull it shut like this?

38:51.950 --> 38:53.781
It's locked like this.

38:56.788 --> 38:59.814
- Hey, Higgie, this door is locked.
- There's some mistake.

38:59.858 --> 39:04.659
- Yeah, so go get the jailer or something.
- I could be persuaded to do so.

39:04.696 --> 39:06.994
What do you mean "persuaded"?

39:07.032 --> 39:10.490
- Higgins, you wouldn't.
- Oh, you couldn't.

39:10.535 --> 39:15.336
Use of your aerial services Saturday
and Sunday for a month including petrol.

39:15.373 --> 39:17.466
A month! Man, that is robbery.

39:17.509 --> 39:20.842
- 40 hours of bookkeeping services.
- You've got to be kidding.

39:20.879 --> 39:24.371
And the rainbow room belongs
to the Ornithological Society

39:24.416 --> 39:28.443
the last Thursday of every month
for the next year regardless of who wants it.

39:28.486 --> 39:30.317
Fat chance.

39:32.557 --> 39:36.391
That's the last straw.
He can do it to Magnum but not us.

39:39.164 --> 39:41.155
OK!

39:42.200 --> 39:43.462
Done.

39:52.711 --> 39:55.544
- I'll check inside.
- And I'm supposed to wait here?

39:55.580 --> 39:58.913
Marsha, I am the professional.
I do this for a living.

39:58.950 --> 40:01.475
Big deal. I'll go and you wait here.

40:03.188 --> 40:04.416
We'll all go.

40:04.456 --> 40:08.859
What is so complicated
about putting your head inside a trailer?

40:15.734 --> 40:19.500
Now... I know how this may look
but there's an explanation.

40:19.537 --> 40:21.562
There's been a serious mistake.

40:21.606 --> 40:23.039
There sure has been.

40:23.074 --> 40:26.202
At first we thought it was Andy...
Nothing personal, kid.

40:26.244 --> 40:30.078
When Andy didn't show up, the cops thought
Tom and Marsha were involved.

40:30.115 --> 40:33.448
I talked to those idiots
but they wouldn't listen.

40:33.485 --> 40:36.977
Shut up, Harry. We all know
precisely what happened.

40:37.022 --> 40:40.082
- You do?
- It was pretty nifty, Uncle Harry.

40:40.125 --> 40:44.221
Your only mistake was forgetting
your nephew's name is Andrew.

40:44.262 --> 40:46.492
And that's Andrew, Uncle Harry, not Andy.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.260
You prefer Andrew?

40:49.234 --> 40:52.726
Hey, you've got it. Andrew MacKenzie,
got a great ring. I love it.

40:52.771 --> 40:55.672
Since you're the only family member
that calls him Andy,

40:55.707 --> 40:59.006
when Ice Pick said
Andy MacKenzie was looking for buyers,

40:59.044 --> 41:02.070
I knew you planted his name
and set up this cute sting.

41:02.113 --> 41:05.207
Why, that's ridiculous.
This is a family business.

41:05.250 --> 41:07.411
I'm the president. I can do anything I want.

41:07.452 --> 41:10.285
You're president
because I've allowed you to be.

41:10.321 --> 41:13.051
My 51 %/% of MacKenzie runs this business.

41:13.091 --> 41:15.389
And from this moment on, you're fired.

41:15.427 --> 41:18.555
The whole board's got
to sit down and discuss this.

41:18.596 --> 41:23.465
Well, since the whole board is right here,
we'll have a meeting right now.

41:23.501 --> 41:28.905
All those in favor of booting this little worm
out on his worthless tail, say aye.

41:28.940 --> 41:30.271
Aye.

41:30.308 --> 41:32.242
Opposed?

41:32.277 --> 41:35.940
Unanimous.
Now, that takes care of family business.

41:35.980 --> 41:39.711
There's just one little thing,
the criminal charges.

41:39.751 --> 41:41.378
Such as fraud.

41:41.419 --> 41:43.250
- And theft.
- Attempted murder.

41:43.288 --> 41:47.418
What are you talking about?
Those boxes missed you. That was a warning.

41:47.459 --> 41:50.087
Tell it to the police. They're on their way.

41:51.463 --> 41:56.696
Harry! Uncle Harry, stop!
Are you just going to stand there?

41:56.735 --> 42:00.102
- You said the police are on their way.
- What if they miss him?

42:01.840 --> 42:04.001
Grandmother, Andrew, in the car.

42:04.042 --> 42:08.445
Wait a minute. No. Wait. Stop.
You don't have to stop him.

42:08.480 --> 42:11.608
Let the police do that.
That's what they're paid for.

42:11.649 --> 42:14.550
Marsha, you've been watching
too many detective shows.

42:14.586 --> 42:17.714
- Are you coming?
- No, I'm not coming.

42:17.756 --> 42:20.452
OK, wait. I'm coming.

42:20.492 --> 42:23.256
I don't know why I'm coming but I'm coming.

42:41.346 --> 42:45.976
I haven't had
such a good ride in a long time.

42:46.618 --> 42:49.212
The forklift.
Look out for the forklift!

43:08.039 --> 43:09.472
Will you slow down?

43:15.413 --> 43:16.573
Ohh!

43:25.356 --> 43:28.985
Marsha, you're gonna kill us all.
You drive like you cook!

43:29.027 --> 43:30.221
Stop it, Andrew.

43:31.329 --> 43:34.821
The guy with the lights
and the siren, that's a cop.

43:39.671 --> 43:44.370
That's the police. The police.
Do you want me to spell it?

44:07.899 --> 44:11.995
Hi, guys. I think I can explain everything.

44:24.983 --> 44:26.974
Tho...

44:45.870 --> 44:47.531
Thomas!

44:48.339 --> 44:50.170
Hi.

44:50.975 --> 44:52.567
You scared me.

44:52.610 --> 44:55.909
- What happened to you?
- Whiplash.

44:57.181 --> 44:59.775
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.081
I'm sorry. No, it's fine.

45:04.122 --> 45:06.886
Honest. I'm just kidding. It's all better, see?

45:06.925 --> 45:09.826
- Just gives me leverage with Higgins.
- Are you sure?

45:09.861 --> 45:14.355
Yeah, it's all better.
I was just giving you a hard time.

45:15.667 --> 45:17.658
Well, I stopped by

45:17.702 --> 45:21.433
because I never got a chance
to thank you for everything you did.

45:22.941 --> 45:25.102
That's OK. It's just part of the job.

45:26.411 --> 45:28.709
Also you left some things at the cottage.

45:28.746 --> 45:30.407
Oh, my shaving kit.

45:30.448 --> 45:32.746
You can't be without that, can you?

45:32.784 --> 45:36.481
And... these are yours, aren't they?

45:38.656 --> 45:40.647
Wouldn't get married without 'em.

45:42.593 --> 45:47.758
Well, I guess I made a pretty rotten wife, huh?

45:47.799 --> 45:52.862
Well, I didn't make such a hot husband.

45:55.373 --> 45:59.673
I guess this relationship stuff
takes a lot of practice.

46:00.678 --> 46:05.081
It's like golf for me. No matter how much
I practice, I never seem to break 100.

46:05.683 --> 46:08.277
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I sure do.

46:10.321 --> 46:12.312
- Well...
- Hey.

46:15.093 --> 46:19.792
We didn't do so bad after all,
you know, all things considered.

46:19.831 --> 46:22.857
Right. All things considered.

46:23.735 --> 46:25.726
Magnum, your lunch is here.

46:25.770 --> 46:28.068
I say, I didn't realize you had company.

46:28.106 --> 46:33.169
Lunch? Gee, Higgins. How thoughtful.
You shouldn't have.

46:33.211 --> 46:35.679
Precisely what I told Dr Ibold

46:35.713 --> 46:39.479
but he insists you be pampered
like an invalid for the next few days.

46:39.517 --> 46:41.508
Well, thank you very much, Higgins.

46:41.552 --> 46:44.419
Pampering, I refuse to do
but I am willing to help expand

46:44.455 --> 46:47.947
the shockingly narrow boundaries
of your intellectual horizons.

46:47.992 --> 46:49.983
That's very thoughtful but I...

46:50.028 --> 46:53.020
Actually, both of you might
find this of some interest.

46:53.064 --> 46:56.227
It's from my memoirs.
It involves a fascinating experience

46:56.267 --> 46:58.360
that once happened to me in Alexandria,

46:58.403 --> 47:01.270
when I was forced
to feign matrimony with not one

47:01.305 --> 47:04.240
but three daughters of a Bedouin prince.

47:04.275 --> 47:07.005
As a young lance corporal
who'd experienced

47:07.045 --> 47:10.037
but one major affaire de coeur
in his 22 years,

47:10.081 --> 47:12.242
the prospect of an impending wedding eve

47:12.283 --> 47:15.616
with three hot-blooded Bedouin
was indeed an awesome one.

47:15.653 --> 47:19.384
Fortunately, as the youngest daughter doused
the dying campfire

47:19.424 --> 47:21.892
and plunged our tent into pitch blackness,

47:21.926 --> 47:27.296
I recalled a relevant chapter from Rommel's
classic treatise on tank warfare...

47:33.838 --> 47:35.829
Perhaps one had to be there.
