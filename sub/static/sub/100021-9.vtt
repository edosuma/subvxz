17:06.416 --> 17:08.331

a nickname for me.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.865
- That is not what I'm doing.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.435
- Bad enough having
his fucking car in my space.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.353
Lovely fella, really,
wasn't he?

33:27.396 --> 33:29.007
For a mass murderer.

33:30.747 --> 33:34.142
Skinny cunt.
He was a fucking butcher!

33:35.491 --> 33:37.537
For fuck's sake!

33:38.190 --> 33:40.235
Give me a fucking break!

33:45.458 --> 33:48.722
- "Jimmy tossed the empty
bottle into the abyss,

33:48.765 --> 33:51.507
"then held his breath
until he heard it shatter

33:51.551 --> 33:53.509
sharp on the sidewalk below."

33:54.815 --> 33:58.949
"Then he scanned the dark city,deep in its death throes,

33:58.993 --> 34:00.908
"and thought about Susan.

34:00.951 --> 34:03.998
"Her smell, her sex,

34:04.042 --> 34:06.000
"her strength.

34:06.044 --> 34:09.525
"She was out there,
somewhere and everywhere,

34:09.569 --> 34:12.267
"in the city's insistent need,

34:12.311 --> 34:13.834
"in the thrum

34:13.877 --> 34:16.445
"of its unruly heart.

34:16.489 --> 34:20.623
"Her love more powerful
than any he had ever known,

34:20.667 --> 34:23.365
"the thought of it
making him shiver

34:23.409 --> 34:27.282
"despite the August
night's heat.

34:27.326 --> 34:31.591
"She was the first appreciable
proof of God he had ever seen,

34:31.634 --> 34:34.855
"the only real and true beauty
he had ever known,

34:35.334 --> 34:38.206
and he hated himself
for not being worthy of it."

34:39.164 --> 34:40.426
[sighs]

34:40.469 --> 34:42.123
- I knew it.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.647
He never stopped.

34:45.822 --> 34:46.954
- What?

34:47.563 --> 34:49.826
- That's me he's talking about.

34:49.870 --> 34:52.002
The man never stopped
loving me.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.571
[weeping]
I knew it.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.008
[sniffles]
I'm sorry.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.228
[weeping]
- That's okay.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.143
- [whimpers, sniffles]

35:05.755 --> 35:07.409
- Do you want to fuck
or something?

35:10.630 --> 35:13.415
- "Do I want to fuck
or something?"

35:13.459 --> 35:16.288
[sobbing]
- Yeah.

35:16.331 --> 35:19.291
- Don't be reading any more
until I get back.

35:19.334 --> 35:22.337
[sobbing]

35:22.381 --> 35:25.166
Marjorie, you'd better not
be eavesdropping.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.085
- [sighs]

35:33.131 --> 35:35.611
[knocking on door]

35:35.655 --> 35:37.439
- [sighs]

35:37.483 --> 35:40.529
I told you to go away!
- Yeah, and I'm not going.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.750
I either come to youor I go straight to the police.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.317
- Fuck.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.060
Who is that?

35:52.933 --> 35:54.456
- My associate.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.329
- You are making a bad situationworse by being here, Bill.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.547
-I'm not leaving until I get
some information.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.158
- Oh, Jesus.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.204
- Where's Marjorie?
- She's out.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.946
She's getting her hair done
or something, I don't know.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.077
- Her hair?

36:07.121 --> 36:08.470
What's she doing,
her fucking roots?

36:13.606 --> 36:14.998
Somebody's got her.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.437
Tom.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.747
- I need to have a completely

36:24.791 --> 36:26.488
confidential
conversation with you.

36:26.532 --> 36:27.707
- I'm not sure
I can promise you that.

36:27.750 --> 36:28.882
- Then you need
to get the fuck out.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.188
I'm done talking, leave.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.146
- What if I don't?

36:32.799 --> 36:34.540
What, you'll call the police,
will you?

36:51.600 --> 36:52.732
All right.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.822
Confidential,
you've got my word.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.911
- [breathing raggedly]

37:02.698 --> 37:04.047
They got her.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.095
- Who?

37:08.138 --> 37:09.879
- I don't know.

37:09.923 --> 37:13.405
They came in here
and they fucking grabbed her.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.320
I got a phone call.

37:15.363 --> 37:18.497
[hisses through teeth]
Fuck.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.286
Peter does
have the manuscripts.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.509
[sniffles]

37:30.552 --> 37:32.380
They said they wanted
to make an exchange--

37:32.424 --> 37:33.512
Marjorie for the books--

37:33.555 --> 37:35.557
but I don't know
where Peter is,

37:35.601 --> 37:37.167
I don't know
where the books are,

37:37.211 --> 37:39.605
I don't know where Marjorie is.

37:39.648 --> 37:42.303
All I know
is that I believe them

37:42.347 --> 37:44.610
when they say
they are going to kill her.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.616
- Have you talked to Peter?
- Yeah, we've been in contact.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.880
He's formulating
a plan right now.

37:53.923 --> 37:57.405
- Jesus, listen,
the FBI and the police--

37:57.449 --> 37:58.972
- No, no.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.800
- They've got more experience
with this sort of thing--

38:00.843 --> 38:03.716
- No, no, no,
absolutely fucking not, Bill!

38:03.759 --> 38:05.283
They were very clear
about this!

38:05.326 --> 38:07.372
We call the police,
they kill her!

38:07.415 --> 38:09.635
- You need to listen to reason.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.942
- The police can't necessarily
make good on their promises.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.293
The people who have Marjorie,

38:15.771 --> 38:16.946
they can.

38:17.817 --> 38:20.602
- [sniffs]
Mmm, you have not lived

38:20.646 --> 38:23.301
until you've tasted
Alma's stew.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.738
Come on, come on, Marjorie,
you gotta eat up.

38:25.781 --> 38:29.089
This little exchange
may include a rigorous walk.

38:29.132 --> 38:31.352
That a girl, we need
to keep your strength up.

38:31.396 --> 38:34.007
[spoon clinking]

38:34.050 --> 38:36.357
- [sniffs]
I don't believe you.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.141
I think you're gonna kill me.

38:38.185 --> 38:39.795
- That isn't true, Marjorie.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.841
I, of course, would kill you--
it's not beneath me--

38:41.884 --> 38:43.146
but it's not my plan.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.234
Come on...
[babbles]

38:44.278 --> 38:45.497
That a girl.
- Mm.

38:45.540 --> 38:46.411
- Ooh.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.415
- Why would you let me live?
- [sighs]

38:50.458 --> 38:53.026
- I've seen your face,

38:53.069 --> 38:54.462
I know what you've done.

38:54.506 --> 38:57.944
we plan
to get long out of Dodge.

38:57.987 --> 39:00.338
We'll be far away
in a different country

39:00.381 --> 39:01.382
with a lot of money.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.819
Out of reach, out of touch.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.647
- I don't get this.

39:05.691 --> 39:09.216
You struck me as a person
with a compassionate core.

39:09.259 --> 39:11.087
Kind, even.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.175
[bowl clatters]

39:12.219 --> 39:14.439
- Look...
[clears throat]

39:14.482 --> 39:18.225
Life and people arekind of like really good books.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.183
There are chapters, you know?

39:20.227 --> 39:22.534
I've had many
wonderful chapters.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.536
You just caught me
during a bad one.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.680
- You've got a visitor.
- Excuse me?

39:38.724 --> 39:40.769
- That private detective,
Hodges, he just showed up.

39:40.813 --> 39:43.598
- Help! No!
- Get her in the bathroom.

39:43.642 --> 39:46.471
- Not a fucking word.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.820
- Come on, Morris, move!
- Stand up.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.083
Stand the fuck up.
Come on, come with me.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.693
- Okay, sit tight.

39:52.694 --> 39:53.956
[keys jingling]

39:56.263 --> 39:57.786
- [exhales heavily]

39:57.830 --> 39:59.658
[knocking on door]

40:01.486 --> 40:02.704
- Alma.

40:03.662 --> 40:06.926
- Oh, my God,
as I live and breathe.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.188
- Long time.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.842
- I've been seeing you
on the news.

40:09.885 --> 40:12.540
You're like a celebrity,
Mr. Mercedes and all.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.455
Testifying
in that girl's trial.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.761
- Mm-hmm.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.676
You look well.
- As do you.

40:17.719 --> 40:19.634
[gasps]
Don't tell me--

40:19.678 --> 40:22.289
that little offer I made
35 years ago,

40:22.332 --> 40:24.160
you're here to take me up
on it, huh?

40:24.204 --> 40:25.684
- Not quite, no.

40:25.727 --> 40:28.556
- [giggles]
Come in, come in.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.472
[sighs]

40:31.516 --> 40:32.560
[door slams]

40:32.604 --> 40:36.477
- Not exactly
a social call, Alma.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.001
You heard John Rothstein
was murdered.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.960
- I don't live under a rock.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.352
- No.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.007
Well, we've been turning over
quite a few rocks,

40:45.051 --> 40:47.662
truth be told,
since he was killed.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.403
You remember this?

40:50.622 --> 40:52.319
- Mm, one of my favorites.

40:52.362 --> 40:53.886
Not exactly Norman Rockwell,

40:53.929 --> 40:55.844
but it's the thought
that counts, hmm?

40:55.888 --> 40:57.498
- "Gathering nuts
for the winter."

40:57.542 --> 40:59.282
You hated him pretty good.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.241
- You have no idea.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.677
Am I a suspect?

41:02.721 --> 41:04.505
'Cause I've always wanted
to be famous.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.899
Come on, let me get you a beer.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.510
It's not like I bite or
anything. I gave that up.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.381
Come on, Bill, beer time.

41:11.425 --> 41:15.081
- Don't you make
a fucking sound.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.344
- You're not really here
to talk about Rothstein

41:17.387 --> 41:20.216
and whether I killed him,
are you?

41:20.260 --> 41:21.261
- No.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.526
I've come to talk
about somebody else, actually.

41:25.570 --> 41:26.962
Morris Bellamy.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.530
- Who?

41:30.139 --> 41:32.272
- Mm, now, that surprises me.

41:32.315 --> 41:33.752
Word on the street has it

41:33.795 --> 41:36.494
that you and he had
a romantic entanglement

41:36.537 --> 41:38.147
going right back
to when he was a teenager...

41:38.191 --> 41:39.497
- Where'd you hear that?

41:40.454 --> 41:43.413
- And that it's been
going on some since.

41:43.457 --> 41:45.415
No?
- [chuckles]

41:45.459 --> 41:47.287
Somebody Tweet that?

41:47.330 --> 41:50.508
- I don't know, I don't read
that fucking blather.

42:03.085 --> 42:07.176
Morris loved Rothstein
from a literary standpoint.

42:07.220 --> 42:11.267
You loved Rothstein and Morris
from a biblical standpoint.

42:11.311 --> 42:15.968
- [laughing]

42:16.011 --> 42:18.405
You know what I remember
about you?

42:18.448 --> 42:21.451
You don't believe
in coincidence.

42:21.495 --> 42:24.106
- Is he here, Bellamy?
- He is not.

42:24.150 --> 42:25.760
- He's been seen
around here recently.

42:25.804 --> 42:27.196
- He comes and goes.

42:28.589 --> 42:29.721
-Know where I might find him
now?

42:29.764 --> 42:30.852
- I don't know.

42:30.896 --> 42:31.940
- Alma--

42:31.984 --> 42:33.638
- Tell you what
I do know, though.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.901
He's not here now
and you are.

42:35.944 --> 42:38.686
Window of long-overdue
opportunity.

42:38.730 --> 42:40.732
- Please.
- Oh, come on, Bill.

42:40.775 --> 42:42.777
[sniffs]
May be 30-plus years,

42:42.821 --> 42:43.909
but a woman remembers

42:43.952 --> 42:45.998
a certain look she gets
from a man,

42:46.041 --> 42:49.610
and I remember that look
that you gave me that night.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.917
I could have bartered
my way out of that arrest,

42:51.960 --> 42:53.483
couldn't I, hmm?

42:54.615 --> 42:57.139
How much rigor
you got in you now?

42:57.183 --> 42:59.794
- I'm here on a serious matter,Alma, okay?

42:59.838 --> 43:04.364
This Morris character could be
involved in some serious shit.

43:04.407 --> 43:06.409
- What, killing Rothstein?

43:06.453 --> 43:08.716
- It's possible.
- Mm, I doubt it.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.500
Morris is a lover.

43:26.386 --> 43:28.040
I'd say you've seen
all you could see

43:28.083 --> 43:29.345
without a warrant, Bill,

43:29.389 --> 43:30.869
but, hell, go ahead,
look around.

43:30.912 --> 43:33.045
Everything's free here.

43:33.088 --> 43:35.787
- I don't need a warrant.
I'm not a cop anymore.

43:35.830 --> 43:38.528
- Private citizen.

43:38.572 --> 43:40.966
So it's not like
you're on duty or anything.

43:41.009 --> 43:44.273
- Tempting though the offer is,I've got to be going.

43:47.059 --> 43:48.974
Take care, Alma.
- You, too.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.647
You get turned around there,
Bill?

44:11.953 --> 44:14.477
- What's in the shed?
- Personal papers.

44:14.521 --> 44:16.392
Actually, a private chapel

44:16.436 --> 44:18.699
where I pray
and hold Bible classes.

44:18.743 --> 44:21.006
It's my private space.
- Sounds spiritual.

44:21.049 --> 44:22.442
Mind if I take a look?

44:22.485 --> 44:25.010
- Sure, but you gotta take
your clothes off first.

44:25.053 --> 44:27.795
My faith requires that
we enter the holy of holies

44:27.839 --> 44:30.580
as we entered this world.
[smacks lips]

44:30.624 --> 44:33.845
Maybe I'll convert it
into an art studio one day.

44:33.888 --> 44:35.368
Or a man cave.

44:35.411 --> 44:38.676
You could be a charter member
in Alma's man cave.

44:38.719 --> 44:42.244
But until that time, Bill,
you've gotta strip.

44:42.288 --> 44:43.942
Please.

44:43.985 --> 44:46.031
- Rain check.

44:46.074 --> 44:47.902

that we're not together.

46:13.466 --> 46:15.816

He could get us both.
