00:01.907 --> 00:03.226
My breakfasts are better.

00:03.251 --> 00:06.451
David Marsden I'm arresting you on
suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.

00:06.476 --> 00:10.476
I really ought to believe in your
innocence, yet I'm not sure.

00:10.831 --> 00:13.358
Put me out my misery.
- I can't do that, Harry.

00:13.383 --> 00:15.949
Yes, you can.

00:18.861 --> 00:21.533
Argh!

00:21.606 --> 00:24.366
I've just been offered a promotion.
- Oh, that's fantastic.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.101
I promised Adam I'd stay here.

00:26.267 --> 00:28.756
Its four months.
If we can't get through that,

00:29.343 --> 00:31.068
we shouldn't be together.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.904
Excuse me, sir.
We've landed.

01:13.661 --> 01:16.061
Very funny.

01:17.461 --> 01:20.943
Hello.
- How was it?

01:20.968 --> 01:22.054
Hot.

01:22.079 --> 01:24.343
Singapore or Angela?
- Both.

01:24.586 --> 01:26.601
I'm exhausted.
- Well, you would be.

01:27.132 --> 01:28.332
The heat.

01:28.598 --> 01:31.701
I think flying to Singapore and back
in the last 72 hours has done it.

01:31.741 --> 01:33.231
Still... worth it?

01:36.833 --> 01:38.611
I don't want to leave you.

01:39.553 --> 01:41.504
It won't be forever.

01:48.113 --> 01:50.993
Well, welcome home.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.555
Oddly, it's beginning to feel like it.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.913
Did Matthew behave himself?
- Yeah, as far as I know.

02:02.782 --> 02:04.593
I did check on him a couple of times.

02:04.618 --> 02:08.243
But he seemed to spend most of the weekend
with his head in the computer.

02:08.306 --> 02:10.233
Oh, your Scotch is still intact.

02:10.508 --> 02:13.353
Well, almost, but to be fair, that was me.

02:13.393 --> 02:15.833
Er...
Oh, we did have one small drama.

02:16.255 --> 02:20.033
I caught him trying to reheat
some defrosted chicken.

02:20.073 --> 02:24.309
That near miss with salmonella
poisoning aside, nothing to report.

02:24.919 --> 02:26.122
Adam?

Synced and corrected by minouhse

02:40.910 --> 02:44.643
How did you sleep?
- Huh. The spare room.

02:44.668 --> 02:46.988
We really must do something
about that mattress.

02:47.028 --> 02:48.683
Well, you won't be on it again.

02:49.588 --> 02:50.867
That's a relief.

02:51.229 --> 02:53.109
I mean, I've come to a decision.

02:54.682 --> 02:57.445
Even if the police decide
that you have no case to answer,

02:57.668 --> 03:01.323
there are bound to be those who say
that there is no smoke without fire.

03:02.063 --> 03:03.617
I might be one of them.
- Robyn?

03:03.642 --> 03:04.869
Either way...

03:05.611 --> 03:09.563
I've realised that I don't really care.

03:10.469 --> 03:11.978
Let's face it, David.

03:12.183 --> 03:14.627
We live largely separate lives.

03:14.747 --> 03:16.747
Well, I didn't ask to sleep
in the spare room.

03:16.771 --> 03:20.011
You don't like my friends;
I don't much care for yours.

03:20.634 --> 03:24.858
Our marriage is a habit that neither
of us have had the energy to break.

03:26.180 --> 03:27.980
Well, now I've found the strength.

03:29.686 --> 03:31.471
I want a divorce.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.458
I think a clean break would be best.

03:34.951 --> 03:37.745
And since two thirds of the
equity in the house is mine,

03:37.800 --> 03:39.797
that means you leaving.

03:40.217 --> 03:42.401
You've nothing else on today, have you?

03:48.119 --> 03:49.919
You said you'd be back in time.

03:51.712 --> 03:53.774
No worries. I'll take 'em.

03:54.189 --> 03:56.126
Right, new plan. You're with me.

03:56.212 --> 03:58.092
Chloe's not ready.
- How do you know that?

03:58.125 --> 04:00.348
You've been on that phone
for the last ten minutes.

04:00.372 --> 04:02.164
Chloe's never ready.
Chloe!

04:02.189 --> 04:05.008
I'm leaving five minutes ago!

04:05.033 --> 04:08.566
Ugh! Sheila!
Is it urgent?

04:08.645 --> 04:11.005
Mum's had a bit of a tumble.
- Oh, no!

04:11.045 --> 04:12.224
How did she do that?

04:12.249 --> 04:14.772
Tripped over the cat.
She's fine.

04:15.199 --> 04:17.387
Bit shaken up.
- Mum or Mimi?

04:17.411 --> 04:20.406
I think she may have sprained
her wrist. Mum.

04:20.964 --> 04:23.285
The doctor's on his way,
but there's no sign of him.

04:23.317 --> 04:25.740
You seen my hairbrush?
- You don't need your hairbrush!

04:25.765 --> 04:27.410
I'd stay, but I've got to get to work.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.074
So do I.
- Seen my maths book?

04:30.168 --> 04:32.871
I told you to get your stuff ready
last night!

04:32.896 --> 04:36.816
I'd take the morning off, but I did
that last week for the Church Synod.

04:37.045 --> 04:40.405
The point is, I think someone
needs to be with her.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.003
For when the doctor comes.

04:42.028 --> 04:44.261
Well, can't she open the door
with her good hand?

04:44.286 --> 04:46.606
She's a bit shaken up.
Did I mention that?

04:46.631 --> 04:49.538
Found it!
- Hairbrush or maths book?

04:49.563 --> 04:51.037
Hairbrush.

04:51.236 --> 04:52.956
Sheila, put Mum on.

04:54.091 --> 04:56.205
Hi, Mum. How are you?

04:56.768 --> 04:58.765
I'm fine, love.

04:58.805 --> 05:00.845
Your sister's worrying over nothing.

05:01.174 --> 05:03.885
OK. Can you put Sheila back on?

05:04.651 --> 05:06.658
Says she's fine.
- Oh, she says that...

05:06.683 --> 05:08.925
Are we gonna go?
- Have you got your maths book?

05:08.965 --> 05:10.765
I don't need it.
- Told you so.

05:10.805 --> 05:13.369
I suppose, if you won't come,
I could go in a little late.

05:13.394 --> 05:15.311
Oh. It's up to you, Sheila.

05:15.336 --> 05:17.467
Seriously, listen, send Mum my love.

05:17.607 --> 05:19.567
Tell her I'll see her soon.

05:21.286 --> 05:23.809
God, if the Church needs another martyr...

05:29.845 --> 05:31.405
Oh... shit.

05:33.093 --> 05:34.293
Sorry.

05:34.363 --> 05:36.230
No, I'll get it when it, you know...

05:36.255 --> 05:37.455
Erm...

05:40.663 --> 05:41.863
Ow!

05:43.885 --> 05:46.114
Hello. I'd like a room, please.

05:46.139 --> 05:48.659
Certainly, sir.
How many nights will that be for?

05:49.832 --> 05:52.632
Let's say a week to begin with.

05:52.758 --> 05:55.238
These are our room rates, sir.
- Thank you.

05:57.823 --> 05:59.143
Gosh!

05:59.183 --> 06:01.703
Can you turn your volume down?
I'm getting feedback.

06:01.743 --> 06:03.023
Sorry?

06:03.087 --> 06:06.556
Yes. Turn your volume down.
The feedback's a nightmare.

06:06.581 --> 06:08.378
Is that better?

06:08.409 --> 06:11.244
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, that's my news.

06:11.331 --> 06:13.091
Not very much.
What about you?

06:13.857 --> 06:15.057
Eh?

06:17.073 --> 06:18.885
Even less.
It's just work, work, work.

06:18.925 --> 06:20.143
Still loving your new job?

06:20.168 --> 06:21.848
What?

06:22.089 --> 06:23.379
What?
- You froze.

06:23.404 --> 06:24.591
Ange, what, I froze?

06:24.616 --> 06:26.574
Ten years ago we didn't have
this technology.

06:26.598 --> 06:28.515
Now we complain if it isn't perfect.

06:28.540 --> 06:31.980
I ought to be getting to work.
Let's arrange for another time to speak.

06:32.205 --> 06:33.951
Angela?
- What?

06:35.285 --> 06:38.043
I missed that.
- Do you really have to go to work now?

06:38.186 --> 06:41.906
Hello? Hello? Ah. Seriously...

06:42.165 --> 06:44.667
Bye. I miss you.

06:46.371 --> 06:49.451
We spend most of the time trying
to arrange when we can talk

06:49.491 --> 06:52.171
and then, when we do,
we run out of stuff to say.

06:52.328 --> 06:57.343
Well, fair enough. Talking online,
it's like visiting people in hospital.

06:57.514 --> 07:00.053
Conversation doesn't flow naturally,
does it?

07:00.078 --> 07:02.481
When Josh started his gap year,
he called every day.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.146
It just made him homesick.
So I said,

07:04.171 --> 07:06.260
Stop.
Throw yourself into the country you're in.

07:06.284 --> 07:07.276
Where is Josh?

07:07.301 --> 07:09.059
No idea.
I haven't heard from him for months.

07:09.084 --> 07:12.611
Spain. He's fine.
Our Adam's friends with him on Facebook.

07:12.651 --> 07:16.561
Angela and me are great when we're together,
but not so great when we're apart.

07:16.586 --> 07:19.686
Most couples, it's the other way
round. It's only for four months?

07:19.711 --> 07:21.537
Ten days till she back here, though.

07:21.562 --> 07:23.334
How's she settling into her new job?

07:23.359 --> 07:25.211
Oh, God, she talks about nothing else.

07:25.759 --> 07:29.811
Oh, here. She had dinner with her
Dad the other night, she was saying,

07:29.851 --> 07:33.027
and he is very taken
with his new girlfriend.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.131
Ah! See!

07:35.171 --> 07:37.161
Eddie talks about you.

07:37.185 --> 07:39.738
She won't tell me nothing.
- Not what you want to know!

07:39.763 --> 07:42.450
I'm not getting any, OK?

07:42.794 --> 07:44.681
So I have to live vicariously through you.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.675
Come on.
What's his technique, then?

07:47.792 --> 07:50.220
Is it like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?

07:50.245 --> 07:53.891
Or more his style, Fast And Furious?

07:53.931 --> 07:56.331
Yeah, and she wonders
why I'm tight-lipped.

07:56.371 --> 07:58.476
Throw us a bone, come on.

07:59.335 --> 08:01.601
Our first night together
was quite entertaining.

08:04.211 --> 08:06.482
Mum?
- Shit! Shit!

08:06.507 --> 08:08.007
I wasn't expecting her back for ages.

08:08.032 --> 08:10.387
Get dressed, get dressed! Come here.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.091
Go. Go. Go. Go.

08:17.379 --> 08:18.781
Mum?

08:20.058 --> 08:22.829
Sorry. Did I wake you?
- Is everything all right?

08:22.894 --> 08:24.811
My friends can be so annoying!

08:24.851 --> 08:28.371
Right I want to know everything, OK?
Now, you take your time.

08:38.171 --> 08:40.566
Ugh. It made me feel like teenager.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.697
I think Eddie failed to mention that.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.611
Did he really describe me as his girlfriend?

08:45.651 --> 08:47.411
Well, you are, aren't you?
- No.

08:47.451 --> 08:50.131
I haven't been anyone's girlfriend
since the age of 24.

08:50.171 --> 08:51.931
It's not like that. We're casual.

08:51.971 --> 08:55.561
You know, we go out together,
enjoy each other's company.

08:55.586 --> 08:57.742
Maybe Edward thinks it's more serious
than that.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.865
I know he does.
He wanted to come back here this week.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.024
I had to make up some lame excuse
to put him off.

09:03.048 --> 09:05.360
I'm not ready for him
to be sharing my sock drawer,

09:05.470 --> 09:08.751
be introduced to the girls as Mum's new...
- Boyfriend.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.977
For want of a better description
of a man in his early 60s,

09:14.470 --> 09:16.102
however adept at yoga.

09:16.220 --> 09:20.602
I don't buy that this is about
the girls and their reaction.

09:20.657 --> 09:23.220
How long has it been
since you were in a relationship?

09:24.165 --> 09:25.436
The best part of five years.

09:25.461 --> 09:26.971
That's why you're holding back.

09:27.011 --> 09:29.360
You've just got too used
to being on your own.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.960
Maybe it's time for you to take the leap.

09:44.186 --> 09:46.226
Oh, hello!

09:46.741 --> 09:49.005
I was looking for Harry.
- Never heard of him.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.295
Well, this is his room.
Or it was last week.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.295
Well, it's my room now.

09:53.865 --> 09:58.170
Oh, God!
What? Harry's died?

09:58.272 --> 09:59.800
That's it! He's dead.

09:59.825 --> 10:01.131
What?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.097
I only saw him a few days ago.
It was Tuesday.

10:04.122 --> 10:05.767
I was supposed to come at the weekend.

10:05.791 --> 10:08.011
We was supposed to watch
the United game together.

10:08.051 --> 10:09.957
Have you got any fags?
Eh?

10:10.301 --> 10:12.211
Nancy!
What are you doing in here?

10:12.251 --> 10:14.496
It's my room.
- It's not, love.

10:14.566 --> 10:16.097
What?
This isn't her room?

10:16.122 --> 10:19.011
Oh, sorry!
I didn't see you there. No.

10:19.171 --> 10:22.411
Some of them like to wander,
and she's the worst.

10:22.577 --> 10:25.051
Come on, sweetheart, let's get you home.
- Oh!

10:25.091 --> 10:26.444
Great!

10:27.264 --> 10:31.131
I came to see Harry!
I know now is the time he has his physio.

10:31.443 --> 10:32.709
But...

10:33.365 --> 10:34.873
I thought he was dead!

10:35.349 --> 10:37.531
Oh, love, has no-one told you?

10:37.974 --> 10:40.044
He passed away on Saturday.

10:40.216 --> 10:42.031
Half time in football.

10:49.372 --> 10:51.603
That is a summary of our fees to date.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.244
If the police do charge you
and it goes to trial-

10:54.269 --> 10:55.869
It won't come to that.

10:56.142 --> 10:58.671
Look, I accept I sailed a little
close to the wind.

10:58.768 --> 11:01.049
I had to, in order to stay ahead
of the pack.

11:01.111 --> 11:03.560
But investing in unregulated schemes,

11:03.748 --> 11:06.884
that's just a rap over the knuckles,
not a criminal prosecution.

11:07.123 --> 11:09.628
David, some of your clients' money wound up

11:09.668 --> 11:12.754
in Chinese property developments
that turned out to be fraudulent.

11:12.779 --> 11:15.125
Chinese residential property
pays a good return.

11:15.168 --> 11:16.925
Not when the residences don't exist.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.950
Well, I cashed out
before that was discovered.

11:18.974 --> 11:21.479
There's the problem.
Police think you were in on it.

11:21.517 --> 11:23.469
I wasn't. I was nearly the victim.

11:24.408 --> 11:26.731
I'm not a criminal.
- And that's our position.

11:26.968 --> 11:29.888
Should the CPS demur and seek a prosecution,

11:29.928 --> 11:33.416
this is an estimate of our fees for
preparation of your case to trial

11:33.441 --> 11:35.688
including counsel's fees.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.749
Ah, that's not so bad.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.389
Oh, that's the VAT.

11:43.168 --> 11:47.528
Ah. Well, I'm glad it's not
something I need worry about.

11:48.591 --> 11:52.088
If they do charge me, then I'm sure
my firm will pay for my defence.

11:53.341 --> 11:54.541
Won't they?

11:54.670 --> 11:56.732
They'll form part of the prosecution case.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.197
Well, technically.
- No, actually.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.506
They won't offer you any support, David.

12:01.585 --> 12:03.465
They'll hang you out to dry.

12:37.648 --> 12:39.288
Does the hotel have a spa?

12:39.328 --> 12:41.898
No, but three doors down
on the left there's one.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.420
Oh!

13:08.753 --> 13:10.726
See, Harry wanted to go.

13:11.704 --> 13:12.992
He told me.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.220
And he asked me to help him.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.119
I tried.

13:23.877 --> 13:26.845
Well, I'm sure you did help him, love.

13:26.870 --> 13:29.537
But what were you gonna do?
You said there was a virus going-

13:29.561 --> 13:33.572
It wasn't the virus. It was a brain
haemorrhage. Well, they don't know.

13:33.597 --> 13:35.357
It might have happened in the pub.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.397
Or it could have been happened, anyway.

13:38.607 --> 13:40.380
Oh, Jen.

13:41.299 --> 13:43.266
I didn't want him to die.

13:43.859 --> 13:45.439
I really loved him.

13:45.636 --> 13:47.476
I know you did.

13:48.421 --> 13:51.587
When I get old...
I want to be like him.

13:53.377 --> 13:55.577
Cantankerous but lovable.

13:56.893 --> 13:58.893
You are.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.586
When I starting back at work, I thought...

14:04.611 --> 14:06.333
I thought I was getting better.

14:06.500 --> 14:11.998
But all this it's... it's just put
me back down there again.

14:13.189 --> 14:14.557
Come here.

14:15.729 --> 14:20.721
Now, listen...
it's not like having a cold.

14:21.354 --> 14:24.927
It's gonna take a bit of time,
I think. You've got to be patient.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.788
But for what's it worth...

14:29.696 --> 14:31.559
I love you.

14:32.528 --> 14:34.093
Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:39.562 --> 14:42.217
What do you mean, you can't come over.
- 'Not next weekend.

14:42.242 --> 14:44.998
There's a dinner I have to
go to with my boss. - But we agreed!

14:45.022 --> 14:47.773
Every second weekend.
- And it's your turn to come over here.

14:47.813 --> 14:50.763
I told him that.
He said that this is more important.

14:50.788 --> 14:53.820
What, than your marriage?
Is he divorced, by any chance?

14:53.875 --> 14:56.906
Married to the job.
Expects us all to be as well.

14:57.093 --> 14:58.738
I'll come the next weekend, I promise.

14:58.762 --> 15:01.522
Or what, unless Gus finds another
reason to keep you there?

15:01.562 --> 15:04.762
There is another alternative.
What are you doing next weekend?

15:04.802 --> 15:07.562
Well, I was expecting to see you,
so currently, nothing.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.522
Well you could come here.
I mean, I'm the one with the job.

15:10.562 --> 15:12.740
I've just got over the jet-lag
from the last trip.

15:12.764 --> 15:13.973
It's not that bad.

15:13.998 --> 15:16.882
If you're 30. What am I supposed
to do while you're out at dinner?

15:16.922 --> 15:19.223
Sleeping off the jet-lag,
by the sounds of it.

15:20.163 --> 15:23.230
Look, have you managed to change your
flight to the following weekend?

15:23.254 --> 15:25.242
I didn't book my ticket yet.
- I knew it!

15:25.356 --> 15:27.973
You never intended to come.
- I did!

15:28.115 --> 15:29.538
I just wasn't sure when I could.

15:29.562 --> 15:33.162
Yeah, and now it turns out you can't!
- Let's talk about it tomorrow.'

15:33.202 --> 15:35.002
Why?
You think Gus will change his mind?

15:35.042 --> 15:37.039
No!
But I'm hoping you'll calm down.

15:37.722 --> 15:39.049
Fine!

15:50.107 --> 15:51.682
Girls.

15:52.237 --> 15:53.898
I want to talk to you.

15:56.628 --> 15:59.588
Listen, I've invited Eddie
to have dinner with us.

16:02.572 --> 16:04.266
He'll be staying the night.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.972
With me, in my room.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.609
Mum, you're not telling us
anything we don't know.

16:11.696 --> 16:12.429
What?

16:12.454 --> 16:15.842
When I came home early the other
night, I saw Eddie's car outside.

16:16.007 --> 16:18.562
Anything chauffeur-driven tends
to stand out round here.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.642
I sent him packing so you wouldn't see him.

16:20.682 --> 16:23.657
I thought it was rather sweet.
- Oh, OK, so...

16:24.836 --> 16:27.192
You're all right, then,
with the idea of Eddie and me?

16:27.216 --> 16:29.768
It's not an image I want in my head.
- It's cool, mum.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.282
We like him.

16:31.721 --> 16:34.842
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I do too.

16:51.267 --> 16:52.713
God, what's become of us?

16:53.017 --> 16:54.858
We used to have such a laugh in the pub.
Remember?

16:54.882 --> 16:56.482
They got rid of trivia machine.

16:56.522 --> 16:58.922
You two liked those.
I never knew the answers.

16:59.205 --> 17:01.042
Sport and Pop.
- Hopeless.

17:04.579 --> 17:07.069
Is it this thing with the police
that's getting you down?

17:07.093 --> 17:08.871
I thought you weren't worried about that.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.970
I'm not.
Overly.

17:14.421 --> 17:15.830
I know!

17:16.358 --> 17:18.007
You've heard about Eddie.

17:18.265 --> 17:20.694
Getting his feet under the table with Karen.

17:20.952 --> 17:24.123
What? - No, I don't think
he has heard about that, Pete.

17:26.263 --> 17:28.718
Oh, God, I introduced them.

17:29.139 --> 17:31.061
She was meant to help me get close to him.

17:31.475 --> 17:32.835
Bastard.

17:33.992 --> 17:35.993
Sorry, Adam,
he's your father-in-law.

17:36.091 --> 17:37.491
No, no.

17:41.802 --> 17:44.461
So have you managed to patch things
up with Angela?

17:44.501 --> 17:47.396
Well, as much as you can
when you're 7,000 miles apart.

17:47.896 --> 17:51.181
You know, I think long-distance
romance, it's an oxymoron.

17:51.221 --> 17:54.853
Yeah. That's another of those words-
- A contradiction in terms.

17:56.297 --> 17:59.501
You need to be more imaginative
when you use the internet.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.539
Porn?
- No! Well...

18:03.478 --> 18:06.261
No, be more romantic.

18:07.143 --> 18:09.143
You know, what do you do
when you're together?

18:09.167 --> 18:11.977
Hm.
- Well, apart from the obvious.

18:13.421 --> 18:15.549
Hm.
- Ah!

18:15.775 --> 18:19.102
I know.
Breakfast in bed.

18:19.338 --> 18:21.941
It's what I do for Jen
when she's got the hump with me.

18:21.981 --> 18:23.981
Yeah, well, most mornings, then.

18:24.768 --> 18:27.342
It's a bit difficult
with her being in Singapore.

18:30.798 --> 18:31.998
David.

18:32.022 --> 18:34.493
What have you done for Robyn
that's romantic?

18:36.147 --> 18:37.412
Agreed to a divorce.

18:37.657 --> 18:38.857
What?

18:40.280 --> 18:42.725
You're getting divorced?
- Since when?

18:42.920 --> 18:44.842
Since she decided she wanted to.

18:45.147 --> 18:48.370
Served me the papers at the budget
hotel I'm now calling home.

18:48.473 --> 18:51.073
God, I'm sorry, mate.
- You never liked Robyn.

18:54.142 --> 18:56.792
No-one likes to see their friends
getting divorced.

18:57.341 --> 18:59.221
Why did you keep it to yourself?

18:59.424 --> 19:02.621
It's not something you crow about,
is it, the failure of your marriage?

19:03.158 --> 19:05.447
I'd clung to the hope
that she might see sense,

19:05.653 --> 19:07.447
then the papers arrived and...

19:08.941 --> 19:12.321
Look, I haven't mentioned this
to anyone else.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.821
Apart from you two.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.867
And I'd really like to keep it
that way, as long as I can.

19:16.892 --> 19:18.837
Yeah, of course.
I won't tell a soul.

19:23.587 --> 19:24.981
Ah, it's Karen.

19:25.746 --> 19:26.946
Hello?

19:26.970 --> 19:29.644
Jen's just texted me.
Are you getting divorced?

19:33.421 --> 19:36.202
The pasta's ready.
- Oh, God! Is he with you now?

19:36.280 --> 19:37.480
Yeah.

19:40.092 --> 19:42.663
I would offer you some
of my anti-depressants,

19:42.688 --> 19:45.381
but Jen's told me not to share.

19:47.512 --> 19:48.787
Beer?

19:54.922 --> 19:57.234
Mum, it's the baby hedgehog having
his nails clipped.

19:57.266 --> 20:00.928
Only me.
- Oh, hello! I didn't expect to see you.

20:00.953 --> 20:03.087
Why? Because I never visit?

20:03.602 --> 20:04.802
No.

20:05.318 --> 20:08.038
Actually, I'm glad you're here.
I'm wanting a word.

20:08.968 --> 20:11.809
Mum!
Left hand, remember?

20:13.211 --> 20:15.729
Do you want to see some cats
that look like Hitler?

20:16.576 --> 20:17.950
Not really, love.

20:18.035 --> 20:19.955
Talk to me instead.

20:20.732 --> 20:23.365
The physio says Mum shouldn't
be using her wrist.

20:23.662 --> 20:25.301
Well, she can lift a cup of coffee.

20:25.326 --> 20:28.699
Not a saucepan. For now, we're going
to have to do things for her.

20:28.724 --> 20:30.691
Cooking, cleaning.
- You might have the time;

20:30.716 --> 20:32.412
I certainly don't.
- She needs us, Jen.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.753
Now, I've drawn up a rota.
- Oh, what?

20:35.778 --> 20:38.372
I'll do four days a week,
if you do the other three.

20:39.168 --> 20:40.823
That seems fair, doesn't it?

20:43.892 --> 20:45.653
I'm so sorry, David.

20:46.012 --> 20:50.372
Well, if I'm honest, Robyn and I have
been drifting apart for a while.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.612
It's probably about ten years or more.

20:52.889 --> 20:56.412
I had hoped she'd stand by me until
this police thing had cleared up.

20:56.653 --> 20:58.599
It's pretty shitty if she won't.

20:59.334 --> 21:01.818
It must be difficult
being under the same roof.

21:02.201 --> 21:05.389
Yeah, well, actually, I'm living in a hotel.

21:06.479 --> 21:07.911
Not a very nice one.

21:12.629 --> 21:14.293
Well, you must stay for dinner.

21:14.733 --> 21:15.933
Can't he stay the night?

21:15.957 --> 21:18.224
Darling, he won't want to do that,
he's got a hotel.

21:18.248 --> 21:20.117
Not a very nice one.
- It'll do for now.

21:20.142 --> 21:21.350
And then what?

21:22.225 --> 21:24.264
Hi, Dad!
- Dad's homeless.

21:24.483 --> 21:26.172
I'm not homeless.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.661
As such.
- Robyn wants a divorce.

21:28.686 --> 21:31.530
She's kicked him out.
He's living out of a suitcase.

21:31.577 --> 21:33.092
That's terrible!

21:33.132 --> 21:35.592
Why can't he live here?
- Josh's room is free.

21:35.655 --> 21:37.787
He won't want to do that.

21:38.219 --> 21:39.717
Please, Mum.

21:46.499 --> 21:49.916
Well, I suppose...
if it's just for a few days...

21:56.334 --> 21:58.334
Everything you ask, Mr Adam.

21:58.374 --> 22:02.232
Egg Benedick, buck fizz
with fresh squeeze orange,

22:02.257 --> 22:04.697
toast with choice of jam, and coffee.

22:05.138 --> 22:07.840
Yeah, and a rose?
- Naturally.

22:07.865 --> 22:10.481
You're naughty, Joe.
Right, off you go!

22:17.671 --> 22:18.871
Oh, Joe. Joe?
- Yes?

22:18.895 --> 22:21.055
Pick it up. Turn it around.
- Oh. Sorry.

22:24.402 --> 22:26.079
Surprise!

22:28.390 --> 22:29.648
Who are you?'

22:29.673 --> 22:31.745
Angie, there's a waiter at the door!

22:32.726 --> 22:34.093
I get the wrong apartment?'

22:34.118 --> 22:36.280
Oh, no, you did not.
Turn it back, turn it back.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.711
Its right. Go!

22:38.513 --> 22:41.198
Yes?
Adam?

22:41.262 --> 22:44.182
Who was that?
- What's going on?

22:44.237 --> 22:47.277
A surprise breakfast. And what
a surprise. Who was that?

22:47.302 --> 22:49.710
What?
- The guy. The meat head in the towel.

22:49.735 --> 22:52.615
Oh, him. He's my cousin.

22:52.664 --> 22:55.820
Joe, follow her, follow her!
Leave the breakfast!'

22:55.845 --> 22:57.525
Go on, get in there. Go on!

22:57.610 --> 22:58.810
What cousin?

22:58.864 --> 23:00.499
Jerry.
From Santa Fe.

23:00.524 --> 23:02.364
You never mentioned a cousin.

23:02.584 --> 23:04.336
Well, he never came up.

23:04.744 --> 23:07.504
Wait, wait, hang on!
Your Mum doesn't have any siblings.

23:07.544 --> 23:09.100
And your Dad was born in Pakistan!'

23:09.125 --> 23:13.445
Ugh. OK. All right.
He's not my cousin! He's a colleague.

23:13.998 --> 23:16.584
What?
- He stayed over. After the dinner.

23:17.607 --> 23:20.464
So why did you lie?
- Because I knew what you'd think!

23:20.701 --> 23:22.464
Too bloody right it's what I'd think!

23:22.504 --> 23:25.166
He's gay!
He stayed in the spare room!

23:25.400 --> 23:26.600
Prove it!
- That he's gay?

23:26.624 --> 23:29.213
No. That he stayed in the spare room.
Take me there. Joe!

23:29.238 --> 23:32.345
No! Adam, I'm telling you the truth!'
- Well, show me!

23:32.370 --> 23:34.770
Don't you trust me?
- You've already been caught lying!

23:34.794 --> 23:36.371
Please, don't do this to us.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.354
Mr Adam, I'm not real comfortable with this.

23:39.379 --> 23:40.885
Look, Joe, just show me.

23:40.910 --> 23:43.081
Oh, Adam. You're making a big mistake.

23:43.106 --> 23:44.396
Just show me.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.157
This way.

23:48.824 --> 23:50.024
There!

23:51.410 --> 23:53.064
Oh! He made the bed.

23:53.104 --> 23:56.184
Does he have any clothes?
Do you wanna make up some other stories?

23:56.224 --> 23:58.744
I was telling the truth!
- About Jerry from Santa Fe?

23:58.784 --> 24:02.438
Or the gay colleague? Or maybe he's
a random guy you picked up in a bar!

24:02.463 --> 24:05.824
Oh, that's it! That's exactly it!
I was drunk.

24:05.864 --> 24:07.505
I was horny!
- Oh, dear.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.624
You know what, I don't know his name?

24:09.664 --> 24:13.083
But he was great in bed. Satisfied?
- What?

24:13.731 --> 24:15.623
A... Angela.

24:18.944 --> 24:20.984
Actually, I can't believe she'd cheat.

24:21.156 --> 24:26.151
If you'd seen him you might.
He's young, fit... young.

24:28.738 --> 24:31.449
And all because we had our first row.

24:31.474 --> 24:34.384
Oh, dear, do you have any more booze?

24:34.619 --> 24:36.152
I did have some whiskey.

24:38.081 --> 24:40.881
Maybe you should have had your first
row before you got engaged.

24:40.921 --> 24:42.798
If we had, we might have not got married.

24:42.823 --> 24:45.816
That's sort of my point, Adam.
Amaretto?

24:45.859 --> 24:49.179
That's pish.
- Go on, then.

24:51.896 --> 24:53.981
Angela loves you.
I know that she does.

24:54.067 --> 24:55.606
There's got to be more to it than that.

24:55.631 --> 24:58.250
Well her fiery temper, a drunken bender,

24:58.275 --> 25:01.596
his... chiselled abs.
It's a lethal cocktail.

25:02.024 --> 25:06.287
God, it doesn't say much for the state of
your marriage, if that's all it takes.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.482
You volunteer for the Samaritans, don't you?

25:09.507 --> 25:11.267
Mm.
On the helpline.

25:11.554 --> 25:13.514
Have you lost many clients?

25:14.854 --> 25:16.084
Hm.

25:16.504 --> 25:18.384
Maybe I should just get pissed.
Hm?

25:18.424 --> 25:20.092
It's a bit late for that.

25:20.316 --> 25:23.131
Go out on the pull like she did.
Why shouldn't I?

25:31.142 --> 25:32.835
You're very attractive, Tina.

25:33.755 --> 25:35.515
You're very drunk, Adam.

25:36.586 --> 25:39.147
But in the morning,
I'll still be very attractive.

25:44.687 --> 25:46.257
What's your man got going for him?

25:46.282 --> 25:48.667
My man?
- Your married man.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.405
Surely, you could do better than that.

25:50.429 --> 25:53.679
Well, as compliments go,
that's... back-handed.

25:53.740 --> 25:56.127
Does it bother you
that he's got a wife? Huh?

25:57.822 --> 26:00.659
Does she know, by the way?
- I think you've had enough.

26:02.715 --> 26:04.555
You are very attractive, though.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.880
Hey, Angela.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.688
Hi, Matt.
Have you seen your dad this morning?

26:15.713 --> 26:18.797
He's not answering his phone.
- No, I think he's still in bed.

26:18.822 --> 26:20.067
Hang on.

26:20.688 --> 26:23.888
We had a stupid row last night.
I'm not sure he's talking to me.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.874
Yeah. He's er... He's fast asleep.

26:28.899 --> 26:30.759
When he wakes, I'll tell him you called.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.904
Please.
Ask him to ring me.

26:37.784 --> 26:40.615
Sure you got everything you need?
- No, I'll get the rest later.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.840
Oh...

26:54.535 --> 26:56.012
Are you all right?

26:56.206 --> 26:57.731
Yeah, I'm OK.

27:08.764 --> 27:10.783
Oh, shit.

27:14.944 --> 27:16.605
I know. I know.
Wait.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.014
Oh, God.

27:20.574 --> 27:21.774
Sorry.

27:22.227 --> 27:23.585
Bloody Sheila!

27:31.464 --> 27:33.241
Mmm!

27:35.944 --> 27:38.522
You know, David, if you'd been
a cook when we were married,

27:38.546 --> 27:41.226
we might have had a few more years
before we got divorced.

27:41.629 --> 27:44.704
I'm doing coq au vin. I thought the
four of us might eat together.

27:44.744 --> 27:46.544
A little thank you for taking me in.

27:47.614 --> 27:48.904
I'm going out

27:48.944 --> 27:51.184
I'll get it.
- Oh, course.

27:51.224 --> 27:53.493
Yes. You look lovely.

27:54.044 --> 27:56.944
I don't have to.
Will it stretch to five? Five?

27:58.612 --> 27:59.812
David.

27:59.836 --> 28:01.369
Karen said you would be here.

28:01.424 --> 28:03.304
Ah, she didn't tell me you would.

28:05.008 --> 28:06.475
You don't mind eating in, do you?

28:06.499 --> 28:09.366
Oh, not at all, judging by the aroma.

28:09.531 --> 28:11.750
Err I do still have to leave
for London later.

28:11.778 --> 28:13.658
Well, best not distract the chef.

28:15.508 --> 28:17.043
You look lovely.

28:17.172 --> 28:20.061
Thank you. Let me get you a drink.
- Gin and tonic.

28:29.456 --> 28:30.656
There you go.

28:30.944 --> 28:32.467
He seems to be bearing up.

28:32.646 --> 28:34.667
Oh... It's a bit up and down.

28:34.692 --> 28:37.972
I'll be glad when this is over,
to be honest.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.560
Sheila?

28:41.584 --> 28:44.292
I've been trying to get you!
You should be at Mum's.

28:44.651 --> 28:46.261
Well, how do you know I'm not?

28:46.286 --> 28:49.104
Because I am.
- Well, that's all right, then.

28:49.224 --> 28:52.064
Er, no. According to the rota,
it's your turn.

28:53.384 --> 28:56.090
Well, it's not written in stone, is it?

28:56.115 --> 28:59.235
Or you couldn't have Blu-Tacked it
to the fridge.

28:59.424 --> 29:03.615
Do you see?
Look, tell Mum I'll see her later.

29:03.752 --> 29:06.632
OK? Right now, I'm at a funeral.

29:07.504 --> 29:09.377
Pity it's not bloody Sheila's.

29:12.824 --> 29:15.504
Dad always used to perk up
when he knew you were coming.

29:15.544 --> 29:17.424
I always looked forward to seeing him.

29:17.620 --> 29:19.940
It was a shame you couldn't visit
more often.

29:21.626 --> 29:25.344
As my sister was saying,
erm... we er...

29:26.180 --> 29:27.609
appreciate err...

29:28.274 --> 29:29.744
what you did for him.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.878
What's that for?
- By way of a thank you.

29:32.903 --> 29:34.274
I don't want your money!

29:35.659 --> 29:37.634
Is that why you thought I came?
- No.

29:37.659 --> 29:40.104
We didn't mean to insult you.
- Your Dad was a fine man.

29:40.128 --> 29:42.424
But I'm just here
to pay my respects! Right?

29:42.464 --> 29:46.025
Lovely do.
Nice to see you both.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.693
When you say you'll come, you should come.

29:51.984 --> 29:54.784
This isn't a fashion choice,
all right? I was at a funeral!

29:54.824 --> 29:57.339
So you knew you couldn't make it.
- Well, I'm here now!

29:57.364 --> 30:00.143
Too late to get her lunch! I had to do that.
- I can manage.

30:00.168 --> 30:02.893
Can you stop treating her
like she's an invalid! - She is!

30:02.918 --> 30:05.473
God, you're like that Cathy Bates in Misery!

30:05.498 --> 30:09.001
You've always lacked empathy!
You used to tear the heads of my dolls.

30:09.026 --> 30:12.066
Oh, my god, not the Barbies again!

30:12.091 --> 30:15.239
You don't pull your weight.
I do dentist, doctor, chiropodist.

30:15.264 --> 30:17.597
You want her to be dependent on you,
don't you?

30:17.622 --> 30:20.784
Gives meaning to your sad little life.
Anyway she won't be able to-

30:20.824 --> 30:22.763
Stop it, the both of you!

30:23.662 --> 30:25.664
If your poor father could hear you now...

30:26.092 --> 30:28.076
He always hoped you'd be friends.

30:28.186 --> 30:31.361
Give it time, I'd say.
Look at you.

30:31.676 --> 30:33.650
He'll be turning in his grave.

30:34.047 --> 30:35.807
I want you to leave.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.185
See you later, Mum.

30:45.941 --> 30:49.584
So you've met Ryan Reynolds.

30:49.624 --> 30:53.764
Oh, no, only once. We were on the
same table at err this charity gala.

30:53.789 --> 30:55.117
That is so cool.

30:55.142 --> 30:58.249
No, to be honest I had him confused
with Ryan Gosling.

30:58.274 --> 31:01.929
Well, I doubt dad's
heard of either of them.

31:02.156 --> 31:05.544
I'm not sure that Eddie knows
which one played Deadpool.

31:10.355 --> 31:13.134
I met Boris Johnson once.

31:16.393 --> 31:19.893
I'll give him your regards. Er...
that's who I'm meeting in London.

31:21.112 --> 31:23.829
This is delicious coq au vin, David,
thank you.

31:24.354 --> 31:25.824
So who else do you know?

31:25.864 --> 31:30.267
Well, the most impressive man
I ever met was Nelson Mandela.

31:30.572 --> 31:33.626
Oh, I was in this fundraiser in Los
Angeles a couple of weeks ago

31:33.651 --> 31:36.009
with er Leonardo Dicaprio.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.642
I must say, I was surprised when you rang.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.510
I wasn't sure we were speaking.
And for you.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.937
Actually, this was Pete's idea.

31:47.650 --> 31:49.548
Ugh...
So how did it go?

31:49.589 --> 31:52.773
Saint Sheila of Heaton bloody Moor.

31:52.798 --> 31:55.374
Honestly, she's never had kids or a husband.

31:55.399 --> 31:58.333
She's got more time on her hands
than she knows what to do with it.

31:58.357 --> 31:59.830
Whoa, whoa, Jen, love.
Calm down.

31:59.985 --> 32:01.385
You're missing the point.

32:01.410 --> 32:03.444
Sheila doesn't expect you to do more.

32:03.469 --> 32:06.353
She just wants you to notice
how much SHE does.

32:06.379 --> 32:08.463
Well, half of it doesn't even need doing!

32:08.488 --> 32:11.708
Jen, all Sheila wants is to be appreciated.

32:12.145 --> 32:13.404
That's it.

32:15.710 --> 32:18.478
Cake?
Or are you on a diet?

32:18.760 --> 32:20.432
I'm on a health kick.

32:20.830 --> 32:25.310
Erm... gluten-free chocolate gateau,
please. With cream.

32:25.950 --> 32:27.230
Two forks.

32:27.991 --> 32:29.422
Two slices.

32:32.132 --> 32:34.218
So, wanted to apologise, did you?

32:34.338 --> 32:35.711
About your Barbie's?

32:36.356 --> 32:38.317
I think we should let that go, don't you?

32:39.090 --> 32:40.290
No.

32:41.559 --> 32:45.815
I wanted to say thank you for
everything you do for Mum.

32:46.104 --> 32:48.354
Look, if you weren't around, if you

32:48.379 --> 32:51.694
lived in Australia, say...

32:53.009 --> 32:55.630
honestly, I don't know how I'd manage.

32:56.704 --> 32:59.456
Apology accepted.
- I'm not apologising.

33:01.337 --> 33:02.732
I am saying thank you.

33:02.884 --> 33:05.052
So your dig about my sad little life...

33:06.533 --> 33:07.733
Hm...

33:09.407 --> 33:11.755
Sorry.
- It's not easy being me, Jenny.

33:12.132 --> 33:15.313
On my own. I won't lie to you,
it's been a test of my faith.

33:16.052 --> 33:18.956
My comfort is knowing that God
had other plans for me.

33:19.132 --> 33:21.452
To devote my life to the service of others.

33:21.492 --> 33:23.172
You work part-time in a call centre.

33:23.212 --> 33:27.018
On the help desk. There you go
again, always putting me down.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.452
Your life's perfect.

33:29.752 --> 33:31.291
You're not an Old Maid.

33:31.424 --> 33:33.159
You're not barren.

33:34.826 --> 33:36.045
Crying.

33:36.502 --> 33:38.702
Oh, Jen, love, what is it?

33:40.561 --> 33:42.319
Pete's depressed.

33:43.490 --> 33:47.432
And my babies, they're teenagers.

33:47.457 --> 33:50.393
And the mortgage, that's a constant worry.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.703
And, listen, I do my best.

33:54.030 --> 33:56.782
But it's all on my shoulders, isn't it?

33:56.807 --> 34:00.007
And there's only so much that you can take.

34:00.990 --> 34:03.467
Honestly, I can't take it anymore.

34:03.612 --> 34:07.868
Oh, my poor, sweet girl.
Why didn't you tell me?

34:08.835 --> 34:10.630
Right, don't you worry about Mum.

34:10.656 --> 34:12.972
I'll make other arrangements.
- No.

34:13.835 --> 34:15.344
I want to do my bit.

34:15.375 --> 34:18.415
You have to put yourself
and your family first.

34:18.737 --> 34:20.625
Oh, I wish you'd told me sooner.

34:21.972 --> 34:24.588
Here, have some sugar.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.322
They've forgotten the cream.

34:29.112 --> 34:32.413
Do you want a brew?
- Er... no, thank you.

34:33.471 --> 34:34.775
Have you called Angela?

34:34.801 --> 34:37.638
Er... you've already passed on
that message, son.

34:37.663 --> 34:39.068
A couple of days ago.

34:41.924 --> 34:43.877
Dad, where were you the other night?

34:44.094 --> 34:45.467
Your bed wasn't slept in.

34:46.509 --> 34:49.092
Excuse me?
- Where were you?

34:50.033 --> 34:51.532
I was at Tina's if you must know.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.952
What happened?

34:54.047 --> 34:55.687
You want to know what happened?

34:56.101 --> 34:57.381
No.

34:57.718 --> 34:59.515
You are very attractive, though.

35:00.105 --> 35:01.770
Are you coming on to me?

35:02.835 --> 35:04.589
What would you do if I was?

35:08.186 --> 35:10.542
If I thought you'd feel anything,
I'd give you a slap.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.005
Why, because I'm married?

35:12.697 --> 35:14.611
We know that doesn't stop you.
Come here.

35:14.868 --> 35:16.284
Arsehole.

35:16.443 --> 35:17.643
Ugh.

35:17.667 --> 35:18.867
Tina?

35:19.478 --> 35:23.172
I passed out.
Spent the night on Tina's floor.

35:23.617 --> 35:25.143
And in the morning...

35:26.362 --> 35:27.612
Sorry.

35:31.191 --> 35:32.399
Swore off the booze.

35:32.846 --> 35:34.670
Which lasted until Harry's wake.

35:34.695 --> 35:37.064
I know you and Angela have fallen out, but

35:37.445 --> 35:40.248
not talking, it's just being stupid.

35:41.648 --> 35:44.711
You are a very sweet boy.
I blame your mother for that.

35:45.469 --> 35:47.133
Are you going to call her?

35:53.218 --> 35:55.791
So how's David taken to having Eddie around?

35:55.831 --> 35:58.169
Politely.
I don't think he's keen.

35:59.012 --> 36:01.926
Yeah, well, he won't like having
to share a bathroom, I'm sure.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.921
Shared his toothbrush once.
You wouldn't believe the fuss he made.

36:04.946 --> 36:06.934
But Eddie hasn't stayed over yet.

36:07.214 --> 36:08.770
I thought the girls knew about him.

36:08.794 --> 36:11.183
But I don't want them being spectators.

36:11.683 --> 36:13.633
Nor David, for that matter.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.600
Well, him and Pete are going to
cinema tomorrow night.

36:16.625 --> 36:18.181
Yeah, the girls are out too.

36:19.030 --> 36:21.899
And er Eddie happens to be in town.

36:22.147 --> 36:24.382
What have you got planned? Eh?

36:24.803 --> 36:26.638
A little full-contact yoga?

36:26.663 --> 36:29.655
He did offer to show me some Bikram.
Hot yoga.

36:29.719 --> 36:31.311
I'll bet it bloody is.

36:33.998 --> 36:36.319
So, go on.
Spit it out.

36:37.414 --> 36:39.752
Is he any good?
- Advanced.

36:40.849 --> 36:43.769
He could teach if he wanted.
- Really?

36:44.260 --> 36:47.071
Oh, you're still on yoga, aren't you?

36:47.830 --> 36:50.683
Yeah, I didn't mean that.
- Yeah, I know what you meant.

36:50.708 --> 36:54.269
OK, he's clearly nothing
to write home about?

36:54.339 --> 36:55.867
If you say so, Jen.

36:57.379 --> 36:59.575
Seriously?
Eddie is crap in bed?

36:59.600 --> 37:02.766
Well, that's Jen's interpretation.
She said Karen was being coy,

37:02.791 --> 37:05.046
but thinks she's just too
embarrassed to admit it.

37:05.071 --> 37:08.111
Well, she would be.
Yeah, that Eddie's a dud.

37:08.264 --> 37:11.431
Apparently, they're already thinking
of ways to spice things up.

37:11.471 --> 37:13.231
Pilates or something.

37:14.776 --> 37:16.486
I'm not supposed to tell you this,

37:16.511 --> 37:18.303
but I thought it'd cheer you up to know.

37:18.328 --> 37:19.932
Oh, it does, Pete.

37:22.069 --> 37:24.909
So what did Jenny say exactly?

37:25.308 --> 37:26.706
I've just told you.

37:28.976 --> 37:30.347
Tell me again.

37:32.574 --> 37:34.723
Dad?
Call for you.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.998
Matt?
- No.

37:39.119 --> 37:42.105
You've been avoiding me.
- Are you surprised?

37:43.389 --> 37:45.075
Matt. Can you get the door please?

37:45.100 --> 37:47.111
It was all a misunderstanding.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.262
I'm not saying it was all my fault.

37:49.287 --> 37:51.624
I have to get this.

37:52.455 --> 37:53.655
Matt?

37:58.754 --> 38:00.193
Surprise.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.887
I panicked. I thought if I told you
the truth you wouldn't believe me.

38:04.927 --> 38:06.705
I didn't.
- But you believed I would have

38:06.729 --> 38:08.045
sex with some random guy.

38:08.225 --> 38:09.552
Why did you tell me that?

38:09.577 --> 38:13.895
Because it seemed like that's what you
wanted to hear. I was mad with you.

38:14.504 --> 38:15.753
So mad that,

38:16.683 --> 38:19.663
had Jerry been straight, the thought
might have crossed my mind.

38:22.408 --> 38:23.894
I know what you mean.

38:26.230 --> 38:27.529
Adam...

38:30.219 --> 38:32.886
I don't think were gona make it
through the next four months.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.417
We need to be together.
We're no good when were apart.

38:36.030 --> 38:38.935
We've tried it here.
It didn't work.

38:40.890 --> 38:42.140
What about Matthew?

38:42.335 --> 38:43.631
He's fine now.

38:43.999 --> 38:47.025
He'll manage, we won't.

38:50.255 --> 38:52.115
Adam, I'm flying home tonight.

38:55.818 --> 38:57.713
If our marriage is to survive...

38:58.716 --> 39:01.030
I think you need
to be on that plane with me.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.672
Hello?
- Pete? New client for you love.

39:14.773 --> 39:17.664
Right. - Needs help with
personal care and she's expecting you.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.449
It's Chorlton.
Do you know it?

39:19.970 --> 39:23.580
Yeah, my mother-in-law lives out that way.
- Tavistock Road.

39:24.111 --> 39:27.625
Yeah, that's right.
- Er... number 72.

39:27.903 --> 39:29.103
Right.

39:38.286 --> 39:40.646
Peter, love, it think it might be better

39:40.672 --> 39:42.443
if someone else comes tomorrow.

39:42.872 --> 39:44.599
Reading my mind, Barbara.

39:46.332 --> 39:47.668
Reading my mind.

39:56.010 --> 39:57.413
Very good.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.467
David?
I thought you'd gone to the cinema.

40:07.523 --> 40:09.963
Oh, we missed the start.
I can't abide that.

40:10.570 --> 40:13.488
Gosh, it's rather hot in here.
What's the thermostat set to?

40:13.530 --> 40:15.358
David. I control the temperature.

40:16.386 --> 40:19.492
Eddie.
You can't stay away, can you?

40:19.592 --> 40:22.032
David.
- Can't you go for a walk or something?

40:22.072 --> 40:24.232
No, don't mind me, I'll be fine.

40:24.427 --> 40:26.328
You two enjoy yourselves.

40:27.750 --> 40:28.950
Come on.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.039
If you can.

40:39.154 --> 40:40.394
Hiya.

40:40.993 --> 40:43.793
I've left you a hundred messages.
- I forgot to charge my phone.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.048
Well, what is the point of you have...?
Never mind.

40:46.075 --> 40:48.010
Where's Angela?
- On her way to the airport.

40:48.035 --> 40:50.435
Listen, we need to talk.
Come here.

40:52.774 --> 40:55.872
Oh, poor Mum.
- Poor Mum? What about me?

40:55.912 --> 40:58.832
You deserve Unsung Hero
Of The Year Award, frankly.

40:58.872 --> 41:00.949
Well, except there isn't one.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.826
By definition.
- True.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.810
Good news never comes in an
expensive envelope.

41:06.835 --> 41:08.625
Old Chinese proverb.

41:10.604 --> 41:11.804
Eh?

41:11.828 --> 41:13.708
What is it?
- Jen.

41:15.178 --> 41:18.792
Harry's left me some money in his will.
It's Â£50,000.

41:18.832 --> 41:20.312
Holy Shit!

41:20.587 --> 41:23.128
Language. Shit.

41:24.343 --> 41:27.792
Dad, I've loved having you here,
but you don't need to stay.

41:28.030 --> 41:31.844
Karen will have me back, I'm sure...
if I promise to behave myself.

41:32.112 --> 41:33.752
You don't need to worry about me.

41:33.855 --> 41:35.905
I like my school.
I've got friends.

41:35.929 --> 41:38.801
I'm not gonna screw up my exams.
- I know I know you're not.

41:38.926 --> 41:40.247
But what then?

41:40.568 --> 41:43.740
After your GCSEs?
- My A-levels, I suppose.

41:43.803 --> 41:45.358
So you'd want to stay here?

41:47.322 --> 41:48.837
Here feels like home.

41:51.068 --> 41:52.489
But we can talk online.

41:52.832 --> 41:54.403
Not like we used to.

41:55.241 --> 41:58.521
We didn't know each other properly then.
- What, you think we do now?

41:59.212 --> 42:01.772
I reckon I've got a pretty good
handle on you.

42:06.392 --> 42:08.232
Would you rather that I went?

42:08.881 --> 42:10.190
Gave you some space.

42:19.432 --> 42:20.671
Ohh!

42:21.312 --> 42:23.487
Oh!

42:24.358 --> 42:25.558
Oh!

42:55.738 --> 42:57.401
I thought you weren't coming.

42:59.433 --> 43:00.691
I'm not.

43:00.987 --> 43:02.249
It's Matthew.

43:03.194 --> 43:05.920
We could talk online like he said,
and it would be better, but

43:06.600 --> 43:08.826
but it's no substitute for being with him.

43:09.185 --> 43:11.154
For most of the last three years I haven't,

43:11.178 --> 43:14.522
and in another three he's gona be 18,
and I won't have no claim on him.

43:14.748 --> 43:16.233
This is our time.

43:16.290 --> 43:19.798
His and mine.
We need to spend it together.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.503
Is that what he wants?

43:25.621 --> 43:27.363
Would you rather that I went?

43:27.876 --> 43:29.398
Gave you some space?

43:32.352 --> 43:33.997
Dad, I'm a teenager.

43:35.324 --> 43:37.552
I think you're gonna have
to decide this one.

43:38.458 --> 43:40.258
I hope its what he wants.

43:41.071 --> 43:42.791
And it's the right thing to do.

43:47.472 --> 43:49.129
Why did you come?

43:49.810 --> 43:51.890
Because I owe you an explanation.

43:54.154 --> 43:55.874
I love you, Ange.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.469
But you love him more.

44:01.126 --> 44:02.626
He's my son.
