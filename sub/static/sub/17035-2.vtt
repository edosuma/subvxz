I care! I totally care!

16:04.842 --> 16:06.376
Well, then spend more time with me.

16:06.378 --> 16:07.710
Hug a brother once in a while.

16:07.712 --> 16:10.012
You want a hug?
Then just say you want a hug!

16:10.014 --> 16:12.148
I want a hug!

You see that?! Look at these two!

16:20.657 --> 16:21.756
They're animals.

That's the kind of hate I want to see.

16:26.363 --> 16:28.863
Look, if I'm gonna sneak out of
work in the middle of the day,

16:28.865 --> 16:31.433
it better involve
a margarita or a Cinnabon.

16:31.435 --> 16:33.668
Not a sick kid who won't take a pill.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.536
I told the nurse not to call you.

16:35.538 --> 16:36.604
I'm fine.

16:36.606 --> 16:38.172
Besides, with my hearing getting worse,

all my other senses
are getting stronger.

You did have Cinnabon, didn't you?

16:43.179 --> 16:46.180
Okay, that's it.
This pill is going in you.

16:46.182 --> 16:48.649
Right now, you still have
a choice of which entrance.

16:48.651 --> 16:50.918
[Sighs] Listen.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.853
Sometimes you just got to
do things you don't want to do.

16:53.855 --> 16:55.722
That's called being an adult.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.723
I mean, I don't get it.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.258
It's the easiest thing in the world.

Why can't you do it?

I don't know.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.596
Why can't you parallel park?

17:03.126 --> 17:04.848
I can parallel park.

17:04.849 --> 17:05.897
Not really.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.767
You drive blocks out of your way
just to avoid parallel parking,

17:08.769 --> 17:11.670
which seems like something
an adult should be able to do.

17:11.672 --> 17:13.439
[Sighs] Look.

17:13.441 --> 17:16.008
My dad barked at me when I was
learning to parallel park,

17:16.010 --> 17:17.443
and it was very tense,

17:17.444 --> 17:19.612

I never mastered, okay?

17:19.614 --> 17:20.979
I get it.

Just seems like something you
should have gotten over by now.

lost our side mirror.

I don't know.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.048
Maybe they changed their minds.

18:56.050 --> 18:57.815
Maybe because Dad and I were so earnest.

Because earnestness triumphs
over red tape and bureaucracy
