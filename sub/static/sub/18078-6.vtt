In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:04.403 --> 00:06.166
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:06.238 --> 00:07.705
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:07.773 --> 00:09.001
These men promptly escaped...

00:09.074 --> 00:10.598
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:10.676 --> 00:12.371
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:12.444 --> 00:13.968
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:14.046 --> 00:15.911
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:15.981 --> 00:18.643
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:18.717 --> 00:19.911
and if you can find them...

00:19.985 --> 00:22.180
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

Boy, C.J. Mack.

06:18.944 --> 06:22.345
l wore out three copies
of his Blood Simple album
when we were in Nam.

Hey, man, isn't a dude
alive who haven't heard
of C.J. Mack.

06:25.350 --> 06:26.840
You can say that again,
brother.

06:26.919 --> 06:30.514
Why, right in the middle
of the blood, and the guts,
and the noise...

06:30.589 --> 06:33.683
you could hear
the reassuring sounds
of C.J. Mack.

06:33.759 --> 06:37.058
And that Blood Simple
was practically
the common soldier's anthem.

06:37.129 --> 06:39.154
That was before he got sent up
for manslaughter.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.256
Before he got sent up
on manslaughter charges,
nothing.

06:41.333 --> 06:44.029
The judge gave
a full sentence to the man
'cause he was rock and roll...

06:44.102 --> 06:46.127
with loud music
and all that silly nonsense.

06:46.204 --> 06:48.900
But that was way back then,
and he pleaded guilty.

06:48.974 --> 06:51.408
And he admitted
he fell asleep at the wheel...

06:51.476 --> 06:53.603
and he admitted
that he hit the girl.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.704
But he wasn't on no drugs.

06:55.881 --> 06:57.872
He didn't have any alcohol
in his system.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.178

for parole twice.

07:09.227 --> 07:11.024

for the superior efforts...

07:11.096 --> 07:13.394
of his lawyer,
a Miss Devon Paige...

07:13.465 --> 07:15.296
he wouldn't be
getting released tomorrow.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.460
l don't understand, though.
What's the problem?

07:17.536 --> 07:20.061
l don't know, B.A.,
but you know, me
and a couple of guys, man...

07:20.138 --> 07:21.969
like, we've always
stayed in touch with him.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.167
We go see him, we send him
some of our latest stuff...

07:24.242 --> 07:25.834
you know, just so he can hear
what we're doing.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.845
Matter of fact,
l even gave him a guitar...

07:27.913 --> 07:30.006
and he started recording
some of his own tracks.

07:30.082 --> 07:33.108
Dynamite stuff, man.
lt's like he's getting
that feeling back...

07:33.185 --> 07:35.278
but then it disappears.

07:35.354 --> 07:37.618
He won't take visitors
and he won't see people.

he has no more life,
and he doesn't care.

he's given up on music.

without music.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.533

of his own music.

on this little tape recorder
we gave him, man...

07:55.607 --> 07:56.699

16:00.525 --> 16:03.460
Escaped, while on his way
to the release center,
no less.

16:03.528 --> 16:06.520
lt's all okay, Devon,
really. Relax.

16:06.598 --> 16:07.758
Relax?

16:08.032 --> 16:09.624
Not only are you
an escaped prisoner...

16:09.701 --> 16:12.033
but you're consorting
with known felons.

16:12.103 --> 16:14.833
Extremely well-known felons,
l must say.

16:15.373 --> 16:16.635
l'm Hannibal Smith.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.604
You're the A-Team.
He told me.

16:18.676 --> 16:20.439
(Face)
Aw, thanks for
helping out, Candy.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.740
Anytime, Butch.

16:23.381 --> 16:24.541
Butch?

16:25.950 --> 16:28.714
Do you have any idea
what kind of trouble
you're in?

16:28.786 --> 16:31.721
Not half as much trouble
as he was in prison,
Miss Paige.

16:31.789 --> 16:34.019
Really,
l finally feel safe here.

16:34.092 --> 16:36.526
What are you talking about?
You're not making any sense.

16:36.594 --> 16:38.152
(Murdock)
Yes, he is making sense.

16:38.229 --> 16:40.026
You see, C.J. has
just explained to us...

16:40.098 --> 16:43.329
that he has uncovered
an entire ring
of armed robbers...

16:43.401 --> 16:46.199
that are operating
right inside the prison.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.205
Apparently,
any number of convicts...

16:48.273 --> 16:50.707
and one guard
in particular...

16:50.775 --> 16:51.833
Quint.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.605
...Quint,
Quint is running the ring.

16:53.678 --> 16:54.667
From jail?

16:54.746 --> 16:56.338
Quint is the guard
who is in charge...

16:56.414 --> 16:57.779
of the Work Furlough program.

16:57.849 --> 17:00.147
He picks the prisoners
who go out for the day.

17:00.218 --> 17:03.449
They pick a target to rob
close to the work site...

17:03.521 --> 17:05.113
then they take it down
afterwards.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.451
No one even suspects them...

17:06.523 --> 17:09.686
because
when the robbery occurred,
they were in jail.

17:09.761 --> 17:10.954
lt's true, Devon.

17:11.029 --> 17:13.054
How come you never told me
any of this before?

17:13.131 --> 17:15.998
Because, while
l was locked up in there,
they kept an eye on me.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.228
l didn't know if they were
watching me or listening.

17:18.303 --> 17:19.930
Do you have any proof
of any of this?

17:20.003 --> 17:20.992
Yeah.

17:21.071 --> 17:23.267
Well, then give it to me.
l'll do something about it.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.333
lt's in jail.
Under the floorboards
in the workshop.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.208
l didn't have
a chance to get it out.

17:28.279 --> 17:29.746
And once they knew
l was on to them...

17:29.814 --> 17:32.282
they were watching
to see what l'd done
with the cassettes l made.

17:32.350 --> 17:35.319
(Devon)
Where does that leave you now?
You're still wanted.

17:35.386 --> 17:37.616
You have not been
officially released.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.782
You're gonna
have to let me
take you back.

17:39.857 --> 17:41.051
What do you think, Hannibal?

17:41.125 --> 17:43.593
Well, don't ask him.
He's wanted
by the law himself.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.458
l'm in charge here,
Miss Paige.

17:46.197 --> 17:48.222
You were only invited here
by courtesy...

17:48.299 --> 17:50.199
because Mr. Mack requested it.

17:50.268 --> 17:52.566
lf we take him back to jail
before we catch
those crooks...

17:52.637 --> 17:53.968
he's dead.

17:54.038 --> 17:55.767
Now, you don't want
to get him killed, do you?

17:55.840 --> 17:56.898
Well, no.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.170
[sighing]
l don't know what to do.

17:59.243 --> 18:01.234
l happen to be
an officer of the court.

18:01.312 --> 18:03.371
l could be disbarred
for helping you guys.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.575
Oh, no, you can't.
You were kidnapped.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.618
By me, at gunpoint.
Remember?

18:07.685 --> 18:09.118
l was holding the gun.

18:09.887 --> 18:12.117
Well, what can you do
to get these guys?

18:12.190 --> 18:15.523
We can follow them,
figure out what they're
gonna hit next...

18:15.593 --> 18:18.323
and then give them
an old-fashioned hoe-down.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.023
Right, Murdock?
Sure...

18:20.098 --> 18:21.122
Butch.

18:21.199 --> 18:22.826
Butch?
Butch.

18:23.401 --> 18:24.493
Yeah.

19:00.471 --> 19:02.701
Yes, gentlemen,
may l help you?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.601
You can get in the back
and open that safe you got.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.475
Oh, no.
You will not hurt me?

19:08.546 --> 19:09.740
Just do as l tell you.

19:09.814 --> 19:11.304
Then you will not hurt me?

19:11.382 --> 19:14.215
No, he didn't say that.
He just says
do like he tells you.

19:14.285 --> 19:15.616
[whimpering]

19:25.630 --> 19:26.790
Open it.

19:35.139 --> 19:37.073
[whimpering]

19:37.575 --> 19:38.667
lt's open.

19:38.743 --> 19:40.335
Get out of the way.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.447
Hey, what's going on
back there?

19:53.524 --> 19:55.515
Your friend decided...

19:55.593 --> 19:58.585
it was not nice to rob
crippled old men.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.961
Oh, yeah? l'll show him
what's right or not.

20:01.032 --> 20:03.057
No, pal. l'll show you.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.798

20:40.872 --> 20:42.396
Yeah.
Shall we go?

20:42.473 --> 20:43.462
(Hannibal)
Yeah.
Okay.

20:45.476 --> 20:46.534
[birds chirping]

20:46.611 --> 20:48.602
(Devon)
Yes, we'll be down
at the releasing center...

20:48.679 --> 20:49.873
within the hour.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.112
Well?

20:54.185 --> 20:57.484
Well, l told them
that you surrendered
yourself to me immediately...

20:57.555 --> 20:59.455
and that you wanna go
and turn yourself back in.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.515
And l requested
that Warden Crichton
meet us there...

21:01.592 --> 21:03.617
since he's been
your biggest supporter
in this matter.

21:03.694 --> 21:04.888
So, you think
they'll believe me?

21:04.962 --> 21:06.156
How can they not?

21:06.230 --> 21:09.722
We dropped those guys
right in front of Metropolitan
Police Headquarters.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.827
Along with a little note.
''How can mugs like these...

21:12.904 --> 21:16.203
''be robbing jewelry stores
while doing 20 years
hard labor?''

21:16.507 --> 21:19.032
Come on, let's go.
l told them we'd be there
within the hour.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.278
l don't know
what to say to you guys.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.478
How can l repay you?

21:27.552 --> 21:29.747
How about some tickets
to your next concert?

21:30.388 --> 21:32.322
There's not gonna be
a next concert, B.A.

21:32.390 --> 21:34.950
You're crazy, man.
Singing is what you do.

21:35.026 --> 21:36.618
lt's what l did.

21:37.528 --> 21:39.792
Anyway, thanks.

21:41.132 --> 21:44.260
Perhaps, we could get together
and have dinner sometime.

21:44.335 --> 21:47.964
l can leave home my fake lD,
and you can leave home
your gun.

21:48.039 --> 21:49.506
Maybe, but...

21:51.342 --> 21:53.310
l think you're a little bit
ahead of yourself.

21:57.348 --> 22:00.545
Hi. l'm looking for Ramone,
the photographer.

22:00.618 --> 22:02.017

Ramone?

22:02.086 --> 22:03.678
Work never ends.

22:06.057 --> 22:07.251
(Murdock)
See you, Butch.

22:08.359 --> 22:10.759
l thought you were supposed
to be here tomorrow.

22:14.232 --> 22:16.496
l can't believe
how you mucked this up.

22:17.802 --> 22:20.100
l simply want this guy
taken care of.

22:20.171 --> 22:21.433
Somewhere outside the prison.

22:21.505 --> 22:25.032
l write him
a clean bill of health,
so he'll get paroled.

22:26.477 --> 22:28.672
And then you go ahead
and you let Jones...

22:28.746 --> 22:31.715
and all those other idiots
get theirselves busted.

22:31.782 --> 22:34.615
l swear we didn't know
what was happening.
Those guys weren't even cops.

22:34.685 --> 22:36.152
Lucky for us.

22:36.988 --> 22:40.549
And lucky for you that
that attorney of his
called back here.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.320
Now, l'm going down
to the releasing center...

22:42.393 --> 22:43.792
and l'm going to bring
that guy back.

22:43.895 --> 22:47.092
And l want you to find someone
who's not gonna mess up
this time.

22:47.865 --> 22:49.833
lt's got to look
like an accident...

22:51.102 --> 22:53.093

23:25.002 --> 23:27.197
Ah. How about
some ice tea?

23:28.172 --> 23:31.300
Oh, l'm glad
you guys are still here.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.502

cleared out by now.

23:33.577 --> 23:36.671
We just don't get a chance
to work on our tans
at the hospital.

23:36.747 --> 23:37.907
Yeah.

23:37.982 --> 23:39.847
What happened?
C.J.'s back in jail.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.612
And so are those goons
you guys caught.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.176
What?
That doesn't make any sense.

23:43.254 --> 23:44.687
l know. l know.

23:44.755 --> 23:47.121
[stuttering]
l don't know what to do. l--

23:47.191 --> 23:48.681
Now, now, just calm down.

23:48.759 --> 23:50.624
Take it slowly.
Now, what happened?

23:51.028 --> 23:54.088
We got back
to the releasing center
as we were supposed to.

23:54.632 --> 23:58.159
Then when l tried to have
the arrest of those hoods
checked like you asked...

23:58.235 --> 24:00.328
they couldn't pin anything
on Quint...

24:00.404 --> 24:02.668
because a report
had gone through
about the escape.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.675
That's not possible.
They couldn't have had time
to put through the report.

24:05.743 --> 24:08.007
Warden Crichton verified
that the report went out.

24:08.312 --> 24:10.678
He doesn't know
why it didn't get
to the police any sooner...

24:10.748 --> 24:12.648
but Warden Crichton's
word is strong.

24:12.717 --> 24:14.378
lf you're thinking
what l'm thinking...

24:14.452 --> 24:16.113
my heart belongs to you,
Daddy.

24:16.187 --> 24:17.415
Yeah.

24:17.488 --> 24:19.513
The warden could have been
in on this the whole time.

24:19.590 --> 24:22.150
Crichton?
Yeah, make a nice
little safety net.

24:22.226 --> 24:24.820
Who else could move
prisoners in and out...

24:24.895 --> 24:26.954
have guards changed
without being questioned?

24:27.031 --> 24:29.556
Then he's the one
that's been trying
to kill C.J.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.800
And now he's got him
right back there.

24:31.869 --> 24:35.032
And there could be
a convenient accident
at any time.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.801
You have to do something.

24:36.874 --> 24:39.502
Well, we can't do anything
unless we can
get into that prison.

24:39.577 --> 24:41.272
Why, now, that's crazy.

24:41.345 --> 24:44.280
Maybe KA-Team Radio...

24:45.082 --> 24:47.209
could throw a party for C.J.

24:47.451 --> 24:50.215
l mean, the warden can't kill
the guest of honor...

24:50.287 --> 24:52.312
and not attract attention.

24:52.623 --> 24:55.023
Yeah. And who's
on the guest list?

24:56.127 --> 24:57.492
Rick James.

24:58.129 --> 24:59.528
Tina Turner.

25:00.164 --> 25:01.631
Kenny Rogers.

25:01.899 --> 25:03.423

25:04.602 --> 25:05.660
Oh.

Yes.

25:08.305 --> 25:09.294
No.

25:09.373 --> 25:10.362
Yes.

25:12.176 --> 25:14.303
Of course l'm aware
of what it could do....

25:16.981 --> 25:18.676
Yes, absolutely. l'm for it.

25:18.749 --> 25:21.149
The Governor is correct,
it's a terrific idea.

25:21.218 --> 25:24.483
lt's just that this part
about C.J. Mack....

25:27.224 --> 25:30.216
Yes, he has been
a model prisoner,
right up....

25:32.229 --> 25:33.423
Right.

25:33.764 --> 25:35.026
Yes, sir.

25:35.933 --> 25:37.298
Yes, sir.

25:37.401 --> 25:38.493

for a concert.

Here, tomorrow,
in honor of C.J. Mack.

25:45.409 --> 25:47.934
And one of their requests
is that C.J. perform a song
with them.

25:48.012 --> 25:50.037
We can't
let this guy pal around
with his old friends.

25:50.114 --> 25:51.411
Suppose he tells them
something.

25:51.482 --> 25:53.040
Well, what the hell
am l supposed to do?

25:53.117 --> 25:54.448
The Governor thinks
it's a good idea.

25:54.518 --> 25:56.383
Congressman Pierce thinks
that it's a good idea.

25:56.454 --> 25:58.854
The Mayor thinks
that it's a good idea.

25:58.923 --> 26:01.187
Except for our little problem,
it would be a good idea.

26:01.258 --> 26:03.385
So, how do l
explain to them that
l don't want their guys...

26:03.461 --> 26:05.053
making contact
with C.J. Mack...

26:05.129 --> 26:07.154
because he could
put us away
in our own prison?

26:07.231 --> 26:09.324
He should have
that accident right now.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.458
Yeah.

26:10.534 --> 26:13.128
Well, don't act as dumb
as you are.

l want you
to keep somebody on him
all the time.

l don't want him
out of sight of a prison guard
for more than five seconds...

or it's your butt.
You got it?

Maybe, it'll turn out
to be the best thing.

26:25.282 --> 26:28.774
lf he'll lead us
to those tapes
that he made...

26:29.453 --> 26:32.320
then we get them first.
We haven't got a problem...

26:32.389 --> 26:35.688
'cause once we've got
those tapes in our hand
he can sit here and rot.
