WEBVTT

00:04.370 --> 00:06.206
It's been called the
most unpredictable

00:06.231 --> 00:08.157
general election
in living memory.

00:08.182 --> 00:11.259
Let the people decide,
but only the clever ones.

00:11.284 --> 00:13.886
- You know Viktor Goraya.
- We go get him out.

00:14.011 --> 00:15.908
We've got to get him into a
country that grants asylum.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.229
But to do that, he's
got to cross the border.

00:18.254 --> 00:19.295
You mean illegally?

00:19.296 --> 00:22.353
We need the money. I'm the man
who lost a million quid, remember?

00:22.378 --> 00:24.956
What are the five jobs?
Celeste said you had five.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.143
Don't use her name, not here.

00:27.168 --> 00:29.244
This is an extraordinary result.

00:29.245 --> 00:35.051
They can come to
me, and I will decide.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.441
Happy New Year!

00:55.466 --> 00:57.245
Has everyone got a glass?

00:57.246 --> 00:59.511
Bethany, you do the honours.

00:59.536 --> 01:02.458
It's in your "sync devices."

01:03.640 --> 01:06.740
Happy New Year!

01:07.117 --> 01:09.053
No more than that. Hush now.

01:09.078 --> 01:13.140
It is my honour to
say congratulations,

01:13.165 --> 01:15.795
a very happy
engagement to you both.

01:15.820 --> 01:17.277
Yeah, second time lucky, Dan.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.306
Sorry, everyone. Happy new Year.

01:20.061 --> 01:22.250
You wouldn't believe
how busy the roads are.

01:22.275 --> 01:23.695
Hey, congratulations.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.001
I can't believe you had to work.

01:25.026 --> 01:28.249
Double pay. So, how are
you? Is that the new flat?

01:28.274 --> 01:29.274
How is it?

01:29.299 --> 01:33.577
It's not a flat, it's a room
in a house with 16 people.

01:33.602 --> 01:36.234
Yeah, but it's in one of those
tall back streets in the centre

01:36.235 --> 01:37.913
of Madrid, so... I
mean, it's handy.

01:37.938 --> 01:40.294
They are okay.
They're mostly Somalis.

01:40.295 --> 01:42.865
The detention centres were
full, so they pushed us out,

01:42.890 --> 01:45.302
but, you know,
it's better, I think.

01:45.303 --> 01:46.740
And are they all right

01:46.765 --> 01:49.560
with two men getting
married, Somalis?

01:49.585 --> 01:51.891
Well, if you think about it,
Muriel, Somalia's a Muslim country,

01:51.915 --> 01:53.835
so obviously that's tricky.

01:54.139 --> 01:56.085
That was my point, wasn't it?

01:56.110 --> 01:57.843
Well, now I've told you, so...

01:58.018 --> 02:00.254
And it's greatly appreciated.

02:00.279 --> 02:02.927
- All right, you two, ding-ding.
- Just pointing out a fact.

02:02.952 --> 02:05.606
Which I have absorbed,
thank you. See what it's like?

02:05.631 --> 02:07.030
I go to work to get
out of the house.

02:07.054 --> 02:08.598
The thing is, you lot,

02:08.622 --> 02:10.443
I've got a sort of
announcement to make.

02:10.576 --> 02:13.138
They are never going to
let Viktor back in the UK,

02:13.163 --> 02:16.388
so we thought, when he
gets his residency here,

02:16.811 --> 02:19.281
well, it's obvious, really,
I'll have to move out

02:19.458 --> 02:21.171
and become a Spanish citizen.

02:21.196 --> 02:22.220
Yes!

02:22.265 --> 02:24.249
I thought so. I said so.

02:24.281 --> 02:25.771
That's brilliant, good move.

02:25.796 --> 02:29.038
Yeah, but it takes about ten years
for the whole process to happen.

02:29.063 --> 02:32.212
That's ages, though. I'll be 25.

02:32.237 --> 02:35.108
Trust me, it flies past.
It'll be here before know it.

02:35.133 --> 02:36.276
Will you still be alive?

02:36.301 --> 02:38.320
- Bethany!
- You can't say that.

02:38.321 --> 02:40.575
What kind of question is that?

02:40.600 --> 02:42.313
But you had that radiation.

02:42.314 --> 02:44.187
It's a very good question.

02:44.212 --> 02:47.045
I promise I will cling on for
dear life to get a free drink

02:47.070 --> 02:49.686
out of my brother.
Good luck to all of us.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.850
And here's to you
beautiful Spaniards.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.639
- Yes!
- Danny and Vic.

02:54.664 --> 02:58.257
- Danny and Vic!
- To us. To us.

02:58.906 --> 03:02.315
It's on the Costa
Brava, this little town.

03:03.241 --> 03:05.499
And just outside,
they've printed this village.

03:06.109 --> 03:11.310
This complete village:
houses, squares, all 3D printed

03:11.335 --> 03:14.639
on these clifftops,
overlooking the sea.

03:14.905 --> 03:17.194
That's my job, housing.

03:17.714 --> 03:18.770
I could do that.

03:18.795 --> 03:21.756
I could print whole towns,
whole cities, right here in Spain.

03:22.631 --> 03:24.241
Costa del Danny.

03:24.857 --> 03:26.233
I never call you Danny.

03:28.154 --> 03:29.530
I quite like it now.

03:30.569 --> 03:32.210
I hated it when I
was a kid, but...

03:33.198 --> 03:34.198
Danny.

03:35.959 --> 03:36.992
Vicky!

03:38.010 --> 03:39.726
That's no good!

03:39.751 --> 03:41.461
No. Uh-uh? Uh-uh?

03:41.898 --> 03:42.898
Hola.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.438
Buenos tardes, Vicky.

03:51.211 --> 03:52.790
Sounds like a party.

04:09.264 --> 04:11.594
<i>Spain's calling it the
January Revolution,</i>

04:11.619 --> 04:16.077
<i>as the so-called People's Party,
Nueva Esperanza, declares itself</i>

04:16.103 --> 04:17.377
<i>the new government.</i>

04:17.845 --> 04:20.845
Link TV, news channels, now!

04:20.870 --> 04:23.759
<i>The situation in Spain
means a left-wing government</i>

04:23.784 --> 04:26.884
<i>is being replaced by
a far-left government.</i>

04:27.046 --> 04:28.831
<i>What can we do about Spain?</i>

04:28.856 --> 04:31.548
<i>Well, I'm stuck in the
middle of a hung parliament.</i>

04:31.573 --> 04:32.915
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:36.120
They're saying Nueva Esperanza
has a policy of repatriation.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.524
Anyone without
citizenship is sent home.

04:38.549 --> 04:40.049
I thought they were left-wing.

04:40.074 --> 04:42.094
You've got far-right,
you've got far-left

04:42.302 --> 04:43.901
eventually you
meet in the middle.

04:43.926 --> 04:46.222
They won't let you into
France. Where else can you go?

04:46.247 --> 04:49.261
<i>Outbreaks of violence in
Athens as the country withdraws</i>

04:49.286 --> 04:52.042
<i>from the eurozone,
and the Grexit begins.</i>

04:52.067 --> 04:56.278
<i>Martial law has been declared
as the government of Italy resigns.</i>

04:56.517 --> 04:58.715
<i>Hungary has been
declared bankrupt.</i>

05:00.213 --> 05:02.621
The whole world is on fire.

05:05.895 --> 05:07.250
How long have you got?

05:07.251 --> 05:08.582
About an hour.

05:10.087 --> 05:13.083
<i>The United Nations has threatened
to remove its headquarters</i>

05:13.108 --> 05:14.518
<i>from American soil.</i>

05:14.543 --> 05:17.153
<i>After the suspension
of same-sex marriage,</i>

05:17.178 --> 05:21.271
<i>the Supreme Court has
overturned Roe versus Wade.</i>

05:23.526 --> 05:25.552
- There she is!
- <i>No justice!</i>

05:27.951 --> 05:30.708
- Go back, go back!
- Right, rewind.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.538
- There she is.
- Oh, my God!

05:34.034 --> 05:36.833
I've been banned from
America, banned for life.

05:37.091 --> 05:39.669
- And the government does nothing.
- Exactly, that's what I keep saying.

05:39.693 --> 05:42.044
Ask the Home Office about
Spain, they haven't got a policy.

05:42.069 --> 05:43.372
Nothing. It's been
eight weeks now.

05:43.396 --> 05:45.504
- Don't start with this again.
- Did you see today

05:45.529 --> 05:47.232
they are not calling it a
hung parliament any more.

05:47.256 --> 05:49.131
They're calling it the
Parliament of Water.

05:49.686 --> 05:51.465
Just flows through
your fingers gone!

05:51.490 --> 05:54.100
- It's our fault we voted them in.
- Well, that's helpful.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.786
Yeah, but it's true, you know?

05:55.811 --> 05:58.904
It just proves that democracy
was a very nice idea for a while,

05:58.929 --> 06:00.256
and now it's worn out.

06:00.482 --> 06:02.201
Well, there's always
Vivienne Rook.

06:02.226 --> 06:05.553
- No, stop it.
- Viv could smash the system.

06:05.578 --> 06:07.671
Tell you what's weird, though,
do you remember years ago,

06:07.695 --> 06:09.545
we used to think
the news was boring?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.292
Oh, my God, golden days.

06:11.293 --> 06:13.070
The news would come
on and we'd just yawn.

06:13.095 --> 06:16.757
Now we hide. I have
to hide my eyes, literally.

06:16.782 --> 06:19.118
It's like at school, when they
tell you about the olden days,

06:19.142 --> 06:22.220
with Sun Kings and plays
and people electing pigs.

06:22.245 --> 06:24.220
It's coming back,
it's happening again.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.297
We were lucky for a
bit, born in the '80s.

06:26.298 --> 06:30.297
We had, like, 30 years,
the first 30 years of our lives.

06:30.298 --> 06:31.860
- Couple of wars.
- Yeah, all right,

06:31.885 --> 06:34.265
but you and me,
we had a nice time.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.212
Basically, we had
a really nice time.

06:36.446 --> 06:39.024
Turns out we were
born in a pause.

06:40.384 --> 06:42.461
Oh, you see, somebody
heard me relaxing.

06:42.486 --> 06:45.025
Duty calls. I'm off.

06:45.403 --> 06:46.805
See you Friday, yeah?

06:46.830 --> 06:48.509
How many jobs have you got now?

06:49.823 --> 06:50.887
11.

06:52.263 --> 06:55.025
Here, I'll give you
the hack thing.

06:55.050 --> 06:56.650
- See you.
- Bye.

06:57.997 --> 06:59.767
OK, so take this.
They are the new ones.

06:59.792 --> 07:00.806
They've got Mo Farah on.

07:00.831 --> 07:03.236
I don't need this, thank you
very much. It's only Chinese.

07:03.261 --> 07:05.134
Take it, though. Save
your money for the kids.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.659
You get paid
tuppence at Glover's.

07:06.684 --> 07:08.271
Well, I might not
be there for long.

07:08.296 --> 07:10.879
- Why, what are you doing?
- You've been away.

07:10.904 --> 07:12.608
I've got plans.

07:18.100 --> 07:22.239
There she is, the
beast. It cost Â£20,000.

07:22.264 --> 07:25.600
If you bought that from
scratch, it'd be 50,000, 60, more.

07:26.100 --> 07:29.395
I've checked, and that's a really
genuinely knock-down price.

07:29.420 --> 07:30.475
Yeah, how come?

07:30.614 --> 07:33.255
It's owned by Jonjo's
brother and he's gone to jail,

07:33.280 --> 07:35.304
and now they need to sell
it to raise cash for his kids.

07:35.305 --> 07:37.054
Went to jail for what?

07:37.671 --> 07:39.375
Well, he was selling fish
and chips out of this side,

07:39.399 --> 07:41.882
and drugs out of that
side, if you must know.

07:41.907 --> 07:43.505
Oh, it's a drug dealer's van.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.210
It's a bargain.

07:45.235 --> 07:47.607
I've done a business
plan, which they approved.

07:47.632 --> 07:48.638
They liked it.

07:48.663 --> 07:50.913
And you can have
a look. I'm not daft.

07:51.232 --> 07:54.021
I know are risks, and there
are costs way beyond the van.

07:54.046 --> 07:55.843
We'll have to get it
all kitted out for me,

07:55.868 --> 07:57.872
and I'll need kitchen
space for prep and storage,

07:57.897 --> 08:00.300
but Jonjo says I can have
his brother's for half price.

08:00.852 --> 08:02.211
How much, then, in total?

08:02.992 --> 08:06.273
Well, I can get a loan and a
grant, and Jonjo says they'll

08:06.274 --> 08:09.102
knock off another 10%,
but I still need 10,000.

08:09.127 --> 08:11.086
- I haven't got that!
- I don't mean from you.

08:11.111 --> 08:13.128
- Well, what are you telling me for?
- I mean from Gran.

08:13.152 --> 08:14.152
Oh.

08:14.829 --> 08:16.257
I just haven't asked her yet.

08:16.282 --> 08:18.765
Oh, she'll say yes.
She'll do anything for you.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.313
I thought you were going
to ask me. That's a relief.

08:20.314 --> 08:23.126
No, I'm asking you
if I can ask Gran,

08:23.751 --> 08:26.642
because her money
belongs to all of us, really.

08:27.669 --> 08:28.712
But I need it.

08:28.737 --> 08:29.776
Of course you can.

08:29.878 --> 08:31.078
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:31.251 --> 08:32.429
I think it's brilliant.

08:32.455 --> 08:33.580
I mean, it's a lot of work.

08:33.938 --> 08:35.741
What about Stephen
and Danny boy?

08:35.767 --> 08:38.087
- Have you asked them yet?
- No, I wanted to ask you first.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.813
- But you know what Dan will say.
- What?

08:39.837 --> 08:42.647
- Can we give Viktor a job?
- Oh, stop it.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.414
Can we buy Viktor a truck?

08:44.562 --> 08:46.311
Can we give all
the money to Viktor?

08:46.336 --> 08:47.681
You are so bad.

08:48.255 --> 08:50.054
I know, really.

08:50.079 --> 08:51.523
Honestly, you know.

08:51.735 --> 08:53.931
So, tell me, who's Jonjo?

08:54.300 --> 08:56.632
Because my
brother, he's just thick.

08:56.657 --> 08:57.970
I used to slap him on the head

08:57.995 --> 09:00.181
when he was five years
old and say, "Oi, thick boy!"

09:00.486 --> 09:02.284
He says me hitting him
on the head made him thick.

09:02.308 --> 09:06.173
I said, "You would say that,
because you're thick. QED."

09:06.198 --> 09:07.876
My sister, though, brilliant.

09:08.088 --> 09:10.096
You know those areas in
London they've sealed off?

09:10.121 --> 09:11.829
Won't let commoners
in, like Kensington?

09:11.854 --> 09:14.298
- Yeah.
- She's got a pass. She's allowed in.

09:14.328 --> 09:16.305
- Whoops!
- Get off!

09:16.339 --> 09:17.389
Sorry.

09:18.445 --> 09:20.477
Oh, my God! You're an arse.

09:21.086 --> 09:22.407
Get it off me!

09:24.187 --> 09:27.179
Now, that grill, it can reach
temperatures of 300 Celsius,

09:27.204 --> 09:29.094
which is a bit unnecessary.

09:29.119 --> 09:30.284
Burgers would be carbonised.

09:30.309 --> 09:32.000
But handy if there
is another Ice Age.

09:32.025 --> 09:34.774
We can all huddle in here
and start a new civilisation.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.530
We've lowered
the handles for you.

09:36.555 --> 09:38.024
No good news on the gearbox,

09:38.049 --> 09:40.827
which means you
still need me to drive.

09:40.852 --> 09:43.407
That's okay, as long
as I get free chips.

09:43.743 --> 09:45.985
You want to watch that
drawer, it keeps sticking.

09:46.010 --> 09:50.494
Apart from that, I think
it's about time I kissed you.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.548
No, I don't think so.

09:52.916 --> 09:55.313
For real? Why not?

09:55.618 --> 09:58.188
Jonjo, it's too soon, I
think we should wait.

09:59.118 --> 10:00.398
Okay.

10:04.231 --> 10:06.243
- Have we waited long enough?
- No.

10:08.993 --> 10:11.306
- Have we waited long enough?
- No.

10:15.271 --> 10:16.814
Okay, we've waited long enough.

10:27.557 --> 10:29.783
Hello, here we are!

10:30.230 --> 10:31.282
Bravo!

10:31.307 --> 10:34.018
What do you think? Be
honest, do you like it?

10:34.043 --> 10:36.963
- Just say yes.
- Well I better had, it cost me enough.

10:37.393 --> 10:40.689
And you must be the man with
designs on my granddaughter?

10:40.714 --> 10:43.689
That's me. And I stamped my
designs all over her lovely bum.

10:43.714 --> 10:45.815
Nice to meet you, Mu. Come here.

10:48.006 --> 10:52.167
Roll up, folks, the Rosie
Lyons Experience is now open.

10:52.192 --> 10:54.272
Whoo!

10:54.904 --> 10:57.315
If you want burgers,
we've got acorn burgers,

10:57.340 --> 11:00.615
membrane burgers, ersatz
burgers, bulk burgers, non-burgers,

11:00.640 --> 11:02.014
no burgers, not burgers,

11:02.039 --> 11:04.482
burger substitutes
and paper burgers.

11:04.568 --> 11:06.724
Nicer than it sounds.
What do you think, Mu?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.093
You look like a traditional

11:08.118 --> 11:09.506
quarter pounder with
cheese, am I right?

11:09.530 --> 11:12.546
I'll have a crocodile
sandwich and make it snappy.

11:13.905 --> 11:16.241
- Mum used to say that.
- It's still funny.

11:16.266 --> 11:17.796
It's never not funny.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.724
He's all right, Jonjo, yeah?

11:21.132 --> 11:23.749
He's the sort of man who's
happy when he finds a big crisp.

11:24.811 --> 11:27.100
Rosie's not daft, she
kept an eye on him.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.702
He's good with the boys.

11:29.281 --> 11:31.265
So, I need to get Viktor out.

11:31.753 --> 11:34.234
- Okay, you mean out of Europe?
- Yes.

11:34.713 --> 11:35.764
And into the UK?

11:35.789 --> 11:37.142
- Yeah.
- Illegally?

11:37.167 --> 11:38.167
Yeah.

11:38.496 --> 11:39.524
Do you want me to go?

11:39.549 --> 11:41.354
No, it's okay. But what do I do?

11:42.103 --> 11:44.727
I mean, it's safer now,
because this Spanish revolution,

11:44.752 --> 11:46.297
it's like any
revolution, it's a mess,

11:46.298 --> 11:47.393
no-one knows
what anyone's doing,

11:47.417 --> 11:49.986
but if they get organised,
send him back home,

11:51.650 --> 11:53.447
well, it could be
a death sentence.

11:54.103 --> 11:56.549
It's like that in the Ukraine,
people just disappear.

11:56.915 --> 11:58.003
I can't believe I'm saying this

11:58.027 --> 12:00.032
sitting here in the
garden, but it's a fact.

12:00.295 --> 12:02.042
He could be executed.

12:02.721 --> 12:03.979
So, what do you need?

12:04.457 --> 12:05.846
A fake passport.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.221
You know, really,
I'll leave you to it.

12:10.518 --> 12:12.307
I didn't like to ask her to go.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.319
You think she's okay these days?

12:14.772 --> 12:16.732
She's living with Gran.

12:17.526 --> 12:21.351
So, I just thought you
know some dodgy people.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.251
- Do I?
- Oh, come on, Edith,

12:24.276 --> 12:26.572
your mates, God knows
what you get up to.

12:26.597 --> 12:29.330
Well, yeah, I suppose years ago,
I could have taken you in a pub

12:29.355 --> 12:31.595
down Cheetham
Hill, 300 quid, done.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.893
But these days, you
need a breath scan...

12:34.713 --> 12:37.221
identification by breathing, I
don't know anyone who does that.

12:37.246 --> 12:38.518
Well, there must be a way.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.312
Because we're not stupid,
we're not poor, we're not lacking.

12:41.336 --> 12:42.713
I'm sorry, but we're clever.

12:43.156 --> 12:44.948
We could think of
something, surely.

12:45.534 --> 12:48.462
I don't think refugees are
refugees because they're thick.

12:48.487 --> 12:51.651
No, don't do that, I'm
saying the system is stupid.

12:52.135 --> 12:54.272
Well, do you know the
people that designed Brexit?

12:54.273 --> 12:56.393
For God's sake, don't tell
me we can't out think them!

12:56.611 --> 12:57.635
Okay.

12:57.660 --> 13:00.308
I suppose half your job is
get ex-cons back into housing,

13:00.309 --> 13:01.541
if anyone knows anyone.

13:01.566 --> 13:05.175
I know, but that makes it
worse. I can't ask at work.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.972
One wrong word and...

13:08.261 --> 13:09.386
I like this terrine.

13:11.137 --> 13:12.402
Yeah, Celeste made it.

13:13.855 --> 13:15.535
Even if you can
get him into Britain,

13:15.675 --> 13:17.199
he'll never be a legal citizen.

13:18.910 --> 13:21.518
- So?
- He'd be a criminal forever.

13:21.543 --> 13:23.184
It doesn't matter, does it?

13:24.418 --> 13:25.801
Just live our lives.

13:26.350 --> 13:27.414
No-one would know.

13:28.043 --> 13:29.753
How often did the
police come to the door?

13:29.778 --> 13:32.518
Like, never, not for
people like us. Never.

13:32.543 --> 13:33.700
And we could move.

13:33.886 --> 13:36.739
So, no-one would even ask,
he would just be my boyfriend.

13:36.764 --> 13:39.403
I'd earn the money
and he could be safe.

13:41.059 --> 13:42.973
I mean, that's better than
a death sentence, isn't it?

13:42.997 --> 13:45.839
I mean, for God's
sake, a death sentence.

13:45.864 --> 13:46.888
It's...

13:47.267 --> 13:48.644
Hey, hey, hey!

13:48.669 --> 13:50.123
Careful, you two.

13:50.148 --> 13:52.091
- It gets slippery.
- Okay.

13:52.116 --> 13:54.556
Are we calling that a T-shirt,
or are we calling that a dress?

13:55.908 --> 13:57.318
I don't think it matters.

14:00.260 --> 14:03.162
No, he looks beautiful.

14:05.075 --> 14:06.235
So, what are you going to do?

14:14.513 --> 14:16.340
<i>Telephone call, Edith Lyons.</i>

14:16.365 --> 14:18.701
- Yeah. Shut up!
- <i>Telephone call...</i>

14:18.726 --> 14:20.256
- <i>Edith Lyons.</i>
- Ugh!

14:21.975 --> 14:23.323
Hey. Hello?

14:23.348 --> 14:25.138
<i>This party is brilliant.</i>

14:25.296 --> 14:27.162
Yeah, I know, I can hear it.

14:27.187 --> 14:28.388
<i>Come and have a drink.</i>

14:29.248 --> 14:30.811
I'm in me pants!

14:30.836 --> 14:32.045
<i>That won't affect Fran.</i>

14:34.365 --> 14:37.209
Tell her I said happy
birthday. Where are you now?

14:37.421 --> 14:38.465
<i>I'm out the front.</i>

14:41.118 --> 14:42.671
Oh... All right.

14:46.749 --> 14:48.265
- Hello!
- Hello.

14:49.101 --> 14:51.538
Hey, can I ask though...

14:52.252 --> 14:55.044
what is it with you
and Fran, really?

14:55.069 --> 14:57.506
<i>Nothing, nothing,
just friends, just mates.</i>

14:57.775 --> 14:59.759
<i>Sort of. Now and then.</i>

15:01.024 --> 15:05.452
But the thing is, she says
she's going to Spain in October.

15:05.874 --> 15:08.632
They are taking that tour, songs
and fables, the African thing.

15:08.742 --> 15:12.670
No, no, they're cancelled,
the FCO has labelled Spain,

15:12.695 --> 15:15.500
"We advise against
all but essential travel."

15:15.836 --> 15:16.976
You still go.

15:18.328 --> 15:19.484
I'm engaged.

15:19.843 --> 15:21.333
But she's sponsored
by the British Council...

15:21.334 --> 15:22.804
if you are funded by the arts,

15:22.829 --> 15:25.132
you can just drive into
war zones, no-one cares.

15:25.249 --> 15:26.873
Fran once took sonnets to Syria,

15:26.898 --> 15:29.321
never mind food, have some
sonnets, but no-one stopped her.

15:29.322 --> 15:30.570
Drove in, drove out.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.876
Yeah, Viktor helped her.

15:34.454 --> 15:37.290
With the tour, he
introduced her to that couple,

15:37.291 --> 15:39.501
the ones who
put on the festival.

15:39.917 --> 15:40.917
Well, then...

15:43.009 --> 15:44.073
She owes him.

15:45.073 --> 15:46.680
Pity she can't smuggle him out.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.689
<i>With the vote of no-confidence,</i>

16:06.714 --> 16:09.017
<i>the Parliament of Water
has been dissolved.</i>

16:09.042 --> 16:11.477
<i>The date for the general
election has been set</i>

16:11.502 --> 16:13.611
<i>for Thursday, the
21st of October.</i>

16:13.636 --> 16:17.455
<i>But for the first time in
history, voting is compulsory.</i>

16:17.578 --> 16:20.861
<i>Like Australia, every
British citizen must vote,</i>

16:21.056 --> 16:23.791
<i>or break the law. It's
going to change everything.</i>

16:23.869 --> 16:26.151
<i>I was really looking
forward to the campaign.</i>

16:26.176 --> 16:28.524
<i>There's nothing I like
more than a fair fight.</i>

16:28.549 --> 16:32.642
<i>But these deep fake videos
are ruining the debate,</i>

16:32.667 --> 16:34.096
<i>and they're
threatening democracy.</i>

16:34.277 --> 16:37.470
<i>Deep fakes are videos in
which a living person's face</i>

16:37.495 --> 16:41.095
<i>and voice are recreated
in CGI to say anything</i>

16:41.120 --> 16:42.305
<i>the programmer wants.</i>

16:42.471 --> 16:45.316
<i>There is one obvious solution to
all the foreigners in this country.</i>

16:45.317 --> 16:46.340
<i>That's not me.</i>

16:46.341 --> 16:48.245
<i>Arrest them, throw them out.</i>

16:48.270 --> 16:50.230
<i>I didn't say that, I
would never say that.</i>

16:50.255 --> 16:51.288
<i>And if they resist...</i>

16:51.313 --> 16:53.313
<i>That face and that
voice are completely fake!</i>

16:53.314 --> 16:55.535
<i>Ex-ex-execute them.</i>

16:55.754 --> 16:58.168
<i>Ask me what to do
with the rich, and I say...</i>

16:58.193 --> 16:59.565
<i>That is literally not me.</i>

16:59.590 --> 17:01.861
<i>Take their homes,
burn them down...</i>

17:01.886 --> 17:02.902
<i>It's a fake!</i>

17:02.927 --> 17:05.320
<i>And throw those bastards
to the w-w-wolves.</i>

17:05.346 --> 17:07.349
<i>It CGI, it's a lie!</i>

17:07.622 --> 17:09.622
<i>So, you are saying
these videos are fake?</i>

17:09.820 --> 17:11.644
<i>Oh, of course
they're fake videos.</i>

17:11.669 --> 17:13.606
<i>Everyone can
see they're not real.</i>

17:14.186 --> 17:18.856
<i>All the same, they really
did say those things.</i>

17:19.412 --> 17:20.628
<i>Didn't they?</i>

17:20.973 --> 17:22.592
<i>What do we do?</i>

17:23.590 --> 17:26.537
<i>How do we make a
stand? How do we stop it?</i>

17:34.513 --> 17:37.122
Fran. I need a favour.

17:37.919 --> 17:40.223
Hi, yeah, a woman
called Vita put me through.

17:40.248 --> 17:42.301
My name's Daniel Lyons, I'm
coming to the bank tomorrow,

17:42.325 --> 17:46.154
I need to close my savings
account ending 3032,

17:46.179 --> 17:48.412
and my extra account
ending in 5061.

17:48.685 --> 17:50.881
I need the money in
cash and I need it in euros.

17:51.747 --> 17:53.005
Thank you very much.

17:53.846 --> 17:56.311
<i>And with campaigning
in the final week,</i>

17:56.336 --> 17:59.473
<i>it's fair to say that polls
have no idea what will happen.</i>

17:59.498 --> 18:02.776
<i>Now that voting is compulsory,
no-one can predict how the entire</i>

18:02.801 --> 18:05.075
<i>British population
will vote en masse.</i>

18:05.460 --> 18:06.460
Call!

18:06.855 --> 18:09.988
Family link, audio only.

18:10.482 --> 18:12.756
- <i>Daniel calling.</i>
- Signor, accept.

18:13.076 --> 18:14.647
Hiya, bit busy, what's up?

18:15.028 --> 18:17.316
Hello there, Danny, how are you?

18:17.341 --> 18:19.115
I'm trying to work!

18:19.140 --> 18:20.873
Hi, Gran. I'm at the doctor's.

18:21.576 --> 18:22.615
Make it quick.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.842
Oh, good morning.

18:27.043 --> 18:29.051
Stephen, is that you?
What are you doing?

18:29.076 --> 18:30.709
Parcel on board.

18:30.758 --> 18:32.872
Well, it sounds like you're
doing something else.

18:32.897 --> 18:35.193
Sorry, Celeste, didn't
mean to interrupt.

18:35.608 --> 18:38.090
No, Celeste's at home with me.

18:38.115 --> 18:40.634
Well, she better have a word
with him then, the dirty dog.

18:40.915 --> 18:42.188
For God's sake!

18:42.213 --> 18:45.726
<i>Just to say this man at
work's moved his days about,</i>

18:45.751 --> 18:48.993
so all of a sudden, I've got
a holiday. I'm off to Spain.

18:50.259 --> 18:53.554
Gran, I won't be around on
Sunday, OK? I'm sorry about that.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.469
<i>Cast your vote for
Thursday, it's the law.</i>

18:56.610 --> 18:58.126
Give Viktor our love.

18:58.508 --> 19:02.110
Warn him, I might fly over
there myself one of these days.

19:02.135 --> 19:04.079
Fran is in Madrid, right now.

19:05.516 --> 19:08.955
I know. we're going to meet up.

19:09.894 --> 19:11.392
Should be nice.

19:13.368 --> 19:14.727
Fingers crossed.

19:15.048 --> 19:17.103
- Edith Lyons?
- That's me.

19:17.128 --> 19:18.168
Good luck, Dan.

19:18.705 --> 19:19.955
I'll see you soon.

19:21.189 --> 19:24.127
Have a... nice... time.

19:24.152 --> 19:26.955
I will. I'll see you soon.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.424
- Yeah, bye.
- Family link off.

19:40.011 --> 19:44.057
So, Fran is, like,
plan number one,

19:44.425 --> 19:48.364
but failing that, I've
got 15,000 euros.

19:49.276 --> 19:51.870
Well, strictly
speaking, 15,240 euros.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.486
We are going to buy
our way out of here.

19:54.511 --> 19:57.111
Even if I have to commandeer a
yacht to get us across the Channel,

19:57.179 --> 19:58.690
we will do it. Please say yes.

20:00.058 --> 20:02.682
My God! I'm saying yes.

20:02.707 --> 20:05.296
If you leave Spain and you
get stopped without your papers,

20:06.129 --> 20:07.334
you'll get sent back to Ukraine.

20:07.358 --> 20:09.477
I know. I'm saying yes.

20:10.274 --> 20:12.657
All the yes, completely yes!

20:14.321 --> 20:17.530
I just never thought
you'd, you know...

20:17.555 --> 20:18.821
What? Never thought I'd what?

20:19.321 --> 20:21.219
Well, you are
always kind of boring.

20:21.244 --> 20:23.008
Oh, thank you!

20:23.158 --> 20:26.197
But I like the
boring. I love it.

20:27.749 --> 20:28.955
And all the time...

20:31.064 --> 20:32.603
I kept your front door key.

20:34.286 --> 20:35.431
To get me home.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.677
Let's go have a boring life.

20:53.030 --> 20:55.643
Okay, they said to keep
one of these at all times

20:55.799 --> 20:57.962
under the shirt, because
it's harder to steal.

20:57.987 --> 21:00.759
Wallet, keys, emergency cash.

21:00.784 --> 21:01.871
You've got 200 euros in there,

21:01.895 --> 21:04.643
so if we get separated,
you've got that.

21:04.677 --> 21:05.971
- Okay.
- Okay?

21:13.065 --> 21:15.235
- Oh, yeah.
- We've got to do this now,

21:15.260 --> 21:16.322
before the rest of
the company get

21:16.323 --> 21:17.847
on board, because I
haven't told anyone, okay?

21:17.871 --> 21:19.941
No-one knows about
this. I'd lose my job.

21:19.966 --> 21:21.022
All right.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.932
Go as far back as you can
and we'll surround you with bags.

21:23.957 --> 21:26.152
Is it safe? Oh, now you ask?

21:26.177 --> 21:28.066
- Well, I have to check.
- It's safe, it's okay.

21:28.534 --> 21:29.562
I can manage.

21:29.691 --> 21:30.925
Plenty of people do this.

21:31.737 --> 21:34.754
Now feel the wall, hide
yourself behind the bags.

21:35.441 --> 21:37.269
And it's 500 quid for Jim.

21:37.430 --> 21:40.777
- You said 200.
- Do you want to argue with him?

21:42.537 --> 21:43.569
What's that in euros?

21:43.594 --> 21:44.750
650.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.876
Right, turn your
phone on silent.

21:56.902 --> 21:58.930
I have, it's done, it's good.

21:58.955 --> 22:00.501
Now hide yourself, okay?

22:08.339 --> 22:10.055
Hiya. You all right?

22:10.297 --> 22:11.523
I found that restaurant.

22:11.548 --> 22:12.963
It was brilliant.

22:13.408 --> 22:15.954
This is Dan, he's a
mate from Manchester.

22:15.979 --> 22:17.369
He's coming back with us.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.112
I told him there's no free
rides, he's got to pay his way.

22:20.137 --> 22:21.604
I'll buy you a
drink on the ferry.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.768
You're lucky the Schengen
Agreement's still in place...

22:25.793 --> 22:27.430
by the skin of its teeth...

22:27.455 --> 22:29.589
so we can drive
straight into France.

22:29.809 --> 22:32.996
And if they find him,
it's nothing to do with me

22:33.267 --> 22:34.543
or the company.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.816
He's just a stranger
who's climbed on board.

22:38.212 --> 22:40.229
- Have you got that?
- Yes.

22:40.254 --> 22:43.651
And you can tell your bloody
sister I will not help her ever again.

22:43.676 --> 22:45.823
I know. But we
can do this, Fran.

22:45.848 --> 22:47.737
People travel across
the world to be safe.

22:47.762 --> 22:50.864
We've just got to get
to Dover, that's all.

23:06.446 --> 23:07.565
I'm off.

23:07.736 --> 23:09.603
Tuesday means drug test day.

23:10.163 --> 23:11.351
I'll be back for dinner.

23:12.322 --> 23:13.759
What are you testing this time?

23:14.267 --> 23:16.009
Some epilepsy drug.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.916
300 quid, that's what matters.

23:17.941 --> 23:19.392
Bye, see you later.

23:23.541 --> 23:24.781
OK, so I haven't got long,

23:24.806 --> 23:27.588
because I've got one of those
blood test things at 12 o'clock.

23:28.142 --> 23:31.119
God, I know you've got your
own key, but you could text.

23:33.805 --> 23:35.487
I haven't got long.

23:37.153 --> 23:38.273
Is that supposed to be sexy?

23:38.902 --> 23:39.954
Well, yes.

23:41.774 --> 23:42.971
Here I am.

23:48.008 --> 23:51.089
Okay, it's working.

23:55.341 --> 23:57.143
Morning, you lot.

23:57.453 --> 24:00.010
Right, no-one in the
bathroom, thank you very much,

24:00.035 --> 24:01.113
it's all mine.

24:01.138 --> 24:04.660
And your Uncle Jonjo
stayed over last night...

24:04.721 --> 24:06.511
- say hello.
- Hi.

24:07.994 --> 24:10.301
Right, Lee, don't forget
that thing for school.

24:10.326 --> 24:11.366
All right.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.680
Can I make myself a coffee?

24:14.714 --> 24:15.728
Help yourself.

24:15.753 --> 24:17.963
- Do you want anything, anyone?
- No, we're fine.

24:25.658 --> 24:29.666
Okay, you two, I want you
to go to Leslie down the hall

24:29.691 --> 24:32.980
and ask her what time
the shuttle bus leaves.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.519
Oh, it leaves on the hour.

24:35.574 --> 24:39.425
I want you to go to Leslie and
ask her, and take five minutes.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.144
Split this with your brother.

24:43.169 --> 24:46.058
Â£2.50. Now go. Vamoose!

24:51.976 --> 24:53.630
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:54.094 --> 24:55.749
It's a nice little kitchen.

24:56.515 --> 24:57.616
It's like this on board ship...

24:57.640 --> 24:59.249
we had the galley,
same sort of layout.

24:59.274 --> 25:01.086
Rosie said you were like
Greenpeace, weren't you?

25:01.110 --> 25:03.124
A bit more
ramshackle, but, yeah.

25:03.225 --> 25:05.124
- She said you went all over.
- Yeah.

25:05.157 --> 25:07.390
Atlantic, Pacific,
the Bering Straits,

25:07.745 --> 25:09.367
we sailed up to the
north of Greenland,

25:09.392 --> 25:11.090
saw the last of
the ice disappear.

25:11.115 --> 25:12.331
It's terrible, that.

25:12.356 --> 25:14.609
It's funny, because volunteers
would come on board and...

25:14.625 --> 25:15.796
say, "Oh, I'm a vegan,"

25:15.820 --> 25:17.742
but after three months
of eating dried pulses,

25:17.767 --> 25:19.037
they'd be fishing
with the best of us.

25:19.061 --> 25:20.932
- I bet.
- In the end,

25:20.957 --> 25:23.160
I could fillet a fish
with three strokes.

25:23.185 --> 25:25.699
Head, gut, spine.

25:25.980 --> 25:27.839
One, two, three.

25:28.086 --> 25:30.094
Became a dab hand with a knife.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.613
Cos you're more
than a fling, Jonjo.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.597
Looks like you're staying.

25:38.199 --> 25:41.152
And it strikes me that when a
man enters a family with two kids,

25:42.488 --> 25:45.286
a family with two little
boys right at the heart of it,

25:46.770 --> 25:48.528
then I'd better be on the alert.

25:49.306 --> 25:50.329
You understand?

25:50.354 --> 25:51.354
Yeah.

25:51.489 --> 25:53.561
Because there are
terrible men out there.

25:55.114 --> 25:56.317
But I'm watching.

25:57.809 --> 26:01.528
And believe me, Jonjo,
I've done some shit.

26:02.254 --> 26:03.329
Have you got that?

26:03.330 --> 26:05.168
Honestly, I swear,
it's all about Rosie.

26:05.322 --> 26:06.637
I think she's amazing.

26:07.321 --> 26:08.321
Good.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.012
There's no side to me.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.692
My mother always
says I've got no layers,

26:11.716 --> 26:13.857
and I think your sister's
really, really lovely.

26:15.339 --> 26:16.396
Yeah.

26:16.814 --> 26:17.814
I think you do.

26:19.197 --> 26:20.273
All right.

26:20.562 --> 26:21.787
I'm still watching.

26:27.049 --> 26:28.396
I don't like the sound of it.

26:29.276 --> 26:31.373
Are they safe,
these drugs tests?

26:32.787 --> 26:34.841
300 quid, cash in hand.

26:36.443 --> 26:38.975
Ever since we left the EU,
the medicines agency moved

26:39.000 --> 26:41.569
to France, so now we have to
test all the drugs from scratch.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.288
It's a bonanza
for people like me.

26:45.223 --> 26:46.397
Time's up.

26:47.476 --> 26:48.514
Duty calls.

26:49.443 --> 26:50.686
300 quid.

26:58.971 --> 27:00.139
If you could blow there.

27:02.264 --> 27:03.437
And there.

27:04.961 --> 27:06.005
Thank you.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.443
We'll be taking blood, so
I'm legally required to ask,

27:09.468 --> 27:11.187
do you want to know
your life expectancy?

27:11.507 --> 27:13.857
Um, no. No, thanks.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.226
Right. That should
take about an hour.

27:16.375 --> 27:17.655
I'll come back to
keep an eye on you.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.679
Thanks.

27:47.712 --> 27:50.554
Lyons in five, he's had a reaction,
we might need to flag him up.

27:50.579 --> 27:52.516
- Sure, I'll pull up his file.
- Thanks.

27:54.055 --> 27:55.976
Dr Scott said there's
nothing to worry about.

27:56.001 --> 27:57.842
It's a little bit of a
side effect, that's all.

27:58.659 --> 28:00.768
Yeah, I can't stop... I keep...

28:02.650 --> 28:05.477
I'm looking left all the time, I
can't stop turning my head left.

28:05.502 --> 28:07.781
You are mimicking symptoms
of an epileptic seizure,

28:07.806 --> 28:09.259
but without the seizure itself.

28:09.284 --> 28:11.033
Give it a couple
hours, it will pass.

28:11.267 --> 28:13.126
You came here on
your bike, is that right?

28:13.938 --> 28:15.818
Okay, I don't think that's
safe to get you home.

28:15.881 --> 28:17.773
Have you got someone
who can pick you up?

28:18.275 --> 28:21.828
I could try Elaine.
I can't focus.

28:21.853 --> 28:24.352
- Yeah, it's all right, I'll do it.
- Elaine Parris.

28:26.282 --> 28:28.278
Oh, this is weird.

28:28.643 --> 28:29.932
Gran would kill me.

28:29.957 --> 28:32.526
I'll go to Elaine,
until it passes.

28:33.095 --> 28:34.095
Ohh...

28:38.737 --> 28:39.948
Hi there, how did it go?

28:39.973 --> 28:42.587
I'm calling on behalf
of Mr Stephen Lyons,

28:42.612 --> 28:44.092
he needs you to
come and collect him.

28:44.721 --> 28:46.829
Lyons in five,
nothing to worry about,

28:46.854 --> 28:49.612
- but he's taking transport home.
- Okay, thanks for letting me know.

28:53.964 --> 28:56.368
<i>Phone call, Claverton Facility.</i>

28:56.369 --> 28:58.714
Accept, thank
you, Signor. Hello?

28:58.965 --> 29:01.961
<i>Hello, I'm phoning on
behalf of Mr Stephen Lyons.</i>

29:01.986 --> 29:03.784
He needs someone to
come and collect him.

29:07.910 --> 29:09.830
Hi, my name's
Celeste Bisme-Lyons.

29:09.864 --> 29:11.844
I'm here to get my
husband, Stephen Lyons.

29:20.449 --> 29:23.588
Hey. Darling. Hello.

29:23.613 --> 29:24.971
It's nice to see you.

29:24.996 --> 29:27.269
It's Elaine. We met
at that party thing?

29:27.941 --> 29:29.144
Yeah, I remember.

29:29.652 --> 29:32.965
I was just visiting and
I just popped in, and...

29:33.168 --> 29:36.175
and it turns out he's not
very well. The big lump.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.527
Like a bad reaction, they said.

29:37.698 --> 29:39.736
Yeah, I can't stop
turning my head left.

29:39.769 --> 29:41.269
I was just on my way into work.

29:43.043 --> 29:44.965
Well, good.

29:45.815 --> 29:47.754
Thanks, Elaine, I can
take him home now.

29:48.702 --> 29:49.702
Okay.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.350
See you soon then, bye.

29:52.351 --> 29:53.676
Yeah, thanks.

29:59.551 --> 30:02.343
It's weird, I just keep
turning my head.

30:02.911 --> 30:03.926
I know there's nothing,

30:03.951 --> 30:05.551
but I can't stop
myself from looking.

30:20.045 --> 30:21.513
I think it's getting
better though.

30:23.826 --> 30:25.763
Ruby! Are you home?

30:26.458 --> 30:28.349
I want you downstairs, now.

30:30.233 --> 30:31.233
I'm home!

30:31.654 --> 30:33.029
Ruby, I know you're up there.

30:33.183 --> 30:34.973
I want you downstairs
this very second.

30:34.998 --> 30:37.794
- That's an order.
- So, what's wrong with him?

30:37.819 --> 30:38.905
Ask him yourself.

30:38.930 --> 30:40.608
I'm sorry, it's
weird, it's my head.

30:40.921 --> 30:42.328
What do you mean, your head?

30:42.329 --> 30:44.372
What have they
done to you this time?

30:44.373 --> 30:46.749
Signor, call Bethany at work.

30:46.851 --> 30:48.365
Tag it urgent so she answers.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.014
What's that for?

30:50.796 --> 30:52.069
I think we should tell them.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.702
I've only got a funny head.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.124
What is it? I'm busy.

30:55.149 --> 30:57.269
Your daft old dad's just
got a funny head, that's all.

30:57.928 --> 30:59.599
Hello? Is it really urgent?

30:59.624 --> 31:01.364
I've only got two
minutes for personal calls.

31:01.365 --> 31:02.733
No, it won't take long.

31:03.337 --> 31:05.211
Your dad wants to tell
you something, girls.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.359
Okay, uh...

31:10.851 --> 31:14.404
I go to that clinic on
Tuesdays, and I tried this drug...

31:14.429 --> 31:17.007
No, I don't mean that.

31:18.164 --> 31:20.812
I mean tell them
about Elaine, Stephen.

31:22.586 --> 31:24.946
Tell them about the affair
you're having with Elaine Parris.

31:26.357 --> 31:28.031
What on Earth do you mean?!

31:28.056 --> 31:29.429
And you can shut up.

31:30.609 --> 31:31.907
Signor, end the call.

31:35.450 --> 31:36.884
What's she talking about, Dad?

31:36.909 --> 31:39.326
<i>Phone call, Bethany Bisme-Lyons.</i>

31:39.351 --> 31:40.391
Signor, accept.

31:42.175 --> 31:43.321
Now, tell them.

31:44.252 --> 31:46.743
Tell your daughters,
tell your gran,

31:47.006 --> 31:49.171
and let's tell your
whole bloody family...

31:49.196 --> 31:51.008
you're always
yap-yap-yapping away to them.

31:51.915 --> 31:53.837
Tell them all how you've
been having an affair.

31:55.649 --> 31:58.392
No, that sounds too
classy, doesn't it?

31:59.364 --> 32:01.906
Tell them how you've
been rutting and snorting

32:01.931 --> 32:04.549
and fucking that greasy-haired
little sack for weeks.

32:04.635 --> 32:05.736
For months.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.238
For years.

32:09.985 --> 32:12.369
I've got an idea. Let's ask her.

32:13.150 --> 32:15.649
Signor, call Elaine Parris.

32:15.674 --> 32:17.658
<i>Calling Elaine Parris.</i>

32:33.659 --> 32:36.071
Get out as fast as you can!
They're searching every vehicle.

32:36.096 --> 32:37.518
Come on, mate, we've had it!

32:38.344 --> 32:40.587
Got word down the line, they're
stripping them bare, let's go.

32:40.611 --> 32:42.416
- What will you do?
- Don't worry about us,

32:42.441 --> 32:43.470
there's always an option.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.713
We're heading to Calais.

32:45.471 --> 32:47.361
Oh, I think we've
blown your cover.

32:47.822 --> 32:50.080
Never mind that, just go.

32:50.267 --> 32:51.673
Can we walk? Is it far?

32:51.698 --> 32:53.618
Yeah, I'm just getting...
Right, got it, come on.

32:54.844 --> 32:55.928
Thanks.

32:59.342 --> 33:03.024
It's okay, because I budgeted,
35 euros, cheap hotel,

33:03.049 --> 33:05.831
base of operations,
get you that passport,

33:05.856 --> 33:09.218
then the breath test, and
get us back onto that ferry.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.347
You missed all the drama.

33:27.143 --> 33:28.863
14 missed calls.

33:29.652 --> 33:33.902
Turns out Stephen has
been having an affair

33:33.927 --> 33:35.915
with a woman called Elaine.

33:38.472 --> 33:40.315
Phone call Rosie, thanks.

33:40.597 --> 33:44.299
I've met Elaine.
She's a bit tough.

33:44.544 --> 33:47.183
- <i>There you are.</i>
- So, what the hell?!

33:47.208 --> 33:48.527
Oh, my God! where have you been?

33:48.552 --> 33:50.145
This is like the
biggest day in history.

33:50.169 --> 33:51.747
- Can you believe it?
- <i>What's happening?</i>

33:51.771 --> 33:54.331
How did it happen?
Does everyone know?

33:54.356 --> 33:56.503
Celeste announced
it like the town crier...

33:56.528 --> 33:59.392
even Gran knows, and the kids,
Beth and Ruby, and everyone.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.981
The thing is, she was always
out of his league, really.

34:02.074 --> 34:04.167
- Who was, Celeste?
- Yeah, I mean, look at her.

34:04.192 --> 34:07.683
She's beautiful.
Stephen's just Stephen.

34:09.074 --> 34:11.137
Oh, my God, I'm never
turning my back on you two.

34:11.161 --> 34:12.190
You okay though?

34:12.215 --> 34:14.973
How are you? Are you
with Viktor? Is he there?

34:14.998 --> 34:16.335
Yeah, we're good, we're fine.

34:16.692 --> 34:18.376
There's nothing to
worry about, honestly.

34:18.377 --> 34:19.723
It's all under control.

34:20.018 --> 34:22.071
Oh, my God, though!

34:22.243 --> 34:25.199
Stephen I mean, Stephen?!

34:27.204 --> 34:30.635
You sit there, saying to my
face it didn't mean anything.

34:30.659 --> 34:33.128
- But it didn't.
- Let me tell you how nice it is

34:33.152 --> 34:34.839
to have your whole life
wrecked by something

34:34.862 --> 34:38.192
that didn't mean anything!
Do you think that helps?

34:38.217 --> 34:40.667
No. I'm sorry.

34:40.692 --> 34:42.614
All of it, ruined!

34:42.795 --> 34:45.246
In some dirty little
bedsit in Egerton Road.

34:47.317 --> 34:48.917
- But how do you know?
- I looked her up,

34:48.964 --> 34:50.199
a long time ago.

34:50.675 --> 34:53.683
Elaine Parris, 120 Egerton
Road. Simple as that.

34:53.871 --> 34:55.121
Because what else could I do?

34:55.146 --> 34:57.027
Stuck in this house
with no money.

34:57.295 --> 35:00.285
So, I did the only thing
I could do, I drove there.

35:01.067 --> 35:04.638
This was last year, Stephen,
last year this was September.

35:05.513 --> 35:07.849
I sat outside in the
car, and I thought,

35:08.294 --> 35:09.354
"This is where he does it."

35:09.355 --> 35:12.232
"This is where he makes
that noise and slops it into her."

35:13.144 --> 35:15.367
I'm sorry, Celeste, but I think
that's actually a little bit weird.

35:15.391 --> 35:17.631
You can think whatever you like,
because you can pack your bags

35:17.655 --> 35:20.724
right now and take your
arse back to Egerton Road!

35:21.075 --> 35:22.746
But I'm not with
Elaine. We're not...

35:24.144 --> 35:26.294
Besides, I don't think
you realise I can't leave.

35:26.319 --> 35:27.801
This is my family's house.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.239
Hold on. If you don't mind.

35:30.758 --> 35:33.347
Excuse me, I think if
you look at the deeds,

35:33.372 --> 35:35.020
this is still my house.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.302
I'm really, really sorry, but
not now, Gran. Seriously.

35:37.327 --> 35:39.323
No, it's highly pertinent.

35:39.527 --> 35:42.297
We've got two young girls upstairs
who have had more than enough

35:42.322 --> 35:43.599
trouble for one night.

35:44.036 --> 35:46.599
And I agree with
Celeste, get out.

35:50.839 --> 35:51.839
Thank you.

35:52.544 --> 35:55.864
I am so disappointed to discover

35:55.889 --> 35:59.318
that you are your father's son.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.076
Your mother would've
been disgusted.

36:03.771 --> 36:06.014
- Don't say that.
- She would've been disgusted.

36:07.451 --> 36:09.186
I am so sorry.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.201
Do what Granny says, then.

36:19.599 --> 36:20.599
Out.

36:40.084 --> 36:41.929
You're so stupid, Dad.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.659
I know.

36:46.687 --> 36:48.163
I'm sorry.

37:00.277 --> 37:01.508
What colour is she?

37:03.379 --> 37:05.383
Elaine? She's white.

37:06.735 --> 37:07.735
Bye.

37:14.218 --> 37:16.689
You're not taking the
car. I need it for the girls.

37:16.829 --> 37:18.087
You can bike.

37:52.947 --> 37:54.596
There is a man I
met at Three Bridges,

37:54.720 --> 37:57.700
and he says for a
passport and a breath test

37:57.825 --> 37:59.541
we need to find a
woman called Elodie.

38:01.373 --> 38:02.373
All right.

38:21.464 --> 38:22.488
Bonjour.

38:24.232 --> 38:25.855
Nous cherchons Elodie.

38:26.189 --> 38:28.714
On m'a dit que c'est
possible de la rencontrer.

38:29.269 --> 38:30.269
Ã midi.

38:30.493 --> 38:31.493
Ici.

38:32.151 --> 38:33.331
Oui?

38:53.979 --> 38:57.707
It is 2,000 for the breath
test, it is 4,000 for the passport.

38:57.817 --> 38:59.660
- I need the money now.
- Er, no.

39:00.574 --> 39:02.239
No, we're only going to
pay when we've got them.

39:02.263 --> 39:04.396
Money in advance, or you can go.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.762
So, the passports cost
more than the breath test?

39:12.786 --> 39:16.363
Well, the breath test is easy,
it's like a mint in the mouth,

39:16.364 --> 39:18.371
but the passport is not easy.

39:18.591 --> 39:21.368
It is not paper any
more, it is a polymer.

39:21.511 --> 39:23.114
And I'll need your passport.

39:24.794 --> 39:26.943
- Mine? What for?
- To copy.

39:27.231 --> 39:29.099
Where do you think
the fake's come from?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.614
With a different
photograph, of course.

39:31.639 --> 39:34.405
- Have you?
- Yes. Right, I've got that.

39:34.430 --> 39:35.467
Thank you.

39:39.013 --> 39:41.348
I'll get this back
straight away?

39:41.373 --> 39:45.029
If you don't trust me, please,
go to another. I don't mind.

39:48.385 --> 39:49.413
It's all right.

39:53.700 --> 39:58.984
Daniel Samuel Lyons,
born in 1989, Manchester?

39:59.445 --> 40:01.030
Council officer.

40:03.373 --> 40:08.377
Explain to me, how did the
council officer find himself here?

40:10.104 --> 40:11.272
Because of him.

40:18.559 --> 40:20.695
Now, breath test.

40:21.235 --> 40:22.251
Won't take long.

40:23.815 --> 40:28.141
To be precise, we should have
a qualified dentist in attendance,

40:28.166 --> 40:30.827
but we only have a nurse,
so if you'd like to sue us

40:30.852 --> 40:34.293
for malpractice, we will
fight you through the courts.

40:40.370 --> 40:43.008
Wait here. Two minutes.

40:43.033 --> 40:44.037
All right.

40:44.062 --> 40:47.098
Just a small cap on
the tooth, it needs fixing.

40:47.387 --> 40:50.798
They say it hurts, but
I'm sure you can manage.

40:51.177 --> 40:54.384
Boys like you,
little bit of pain...

40:56.078 --> 40:57.134
Oh, my God.

40:57.478 --> 40:58.978
She hates us!

40:59.251 --> 41:00.367
She really hates us.

41:00.392 --> 41:02.775
What does she mean,
this tooth cap thing?

41:03.380 --> 41:04.411
I hate teeth.

41:04.412 --> 41:05.767
I don't care.

41:06.180 --> 41:08.025
Just fix it in place
with a hammer,

41:08.050 --> 41:09.759
just let me through!

41:11.364 --> 41:12.923
God, 6,000 euros.

41:14.016 --> 41:16.283
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

41:18.134 --> 41:19.244
Hey, no...

41:19.791 --> 41:21.166
It's worth every penny.

41:21.327 --> 41:23.104
Really... Don't do that.

41:23.174 --> 41:27.674
I said... I said, duh,
whatever it takes, didn't I?

41:28.170 --> 41:29.186
Hmm?

41:49.640 --> 41:52.612
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

41:54.398 --> 41:56.350
Oh! What was it? Was it her?

41:58.928 --> 42:00.097
She's coming back.

42:02.017 --> 42:03.300
She has to print that stuff...

42:04.362 --> 42:05.558
She's printed...

42:06.362 --> 42:07.738
She's coming back, yeah?

42:09.262 --> 42:10.395
Do you think?

42:38.044 --> 42:39.583
You could still go home.

42:43.529 --> 42:47.302
Walk up to customs... "Hey,
my passport was stolen."

42:48.372 --> 42:52.332
"OK, no problem, this way, sir."

42:53.541 --> 42:54.549
Yeah...

42:56.007 --> 42:57.015
Bye, then.

42:58.188 --> 43:00.826
- Well, you could.
- I'm taking you home.

43:01.898 --> 43:03.384
We can't get on the ferry.

43:03.686 --> 43:05.897
Well, we just have to
try a different sort of plan.

43:06.990 --> 43:09.584
22 miles, that's all.

43:11.017 --> 43:13.217
Just need to cross 22 miles.

43:25.157 --> 43:26.157
Mummy.

43:27.263 --> 43:28.271
In you get.

43:39.199 --> 43:40.255
What an idiot.

43:40.613 --> 43:41.613
Okay.

43:42.269 --> 43:44.226
I don't want you
criticising your dad,

43:44.995 --> 43:47.906
but, yeah, blasted
fool, fool man.

43:50.611 --> 43:53.796
I can't believe
you knew for ages.

43:54.167 --> 43:55.743
So, you knew at Christmas?

43:56.234 --> 43:59.086
- Yeah.
- And that party on New Year's Eve?

43:59.111 --> 44:01.577
- Yeah.
- And on my birthday, you knew then?

44:01.610 --> 44:02.875
How did you do it?

44:03.532 --> 44:04.532
No choice.

44:05.391 --> 44:06.993
I was trapped here with him.

44:07.735 --> 44:10.347
No house, no money, no savings.

44:11.172 --> 44:12.868
I mean, what else
could we have done?

44:13.374 --> 44:15.374
Go and live with your
gran in Port Maria?

44:15.500 --> 44:17.586
- Oh, no way.
- No, thanks.

44:18.881 --> 44:19.957
You know what she'd say?

44:20.785 --> 44:24.325
You not too wicked and bad.
It's hell you're heading for!

44:25.505 --> 44:26.997
And as for you, Bethany,

44:27.022 --> 44:30.504
now bringing dem sodomite
nastiness around you!

44:35.447 --> 44:37.391
The thing is, I get up at six.

44:39.977 --> 44:40.981
That's okay.

44:41.006 --> 44:43.575
I get up at six and
I do my exercises.

44:44.310 --> 44:46.004
I do callisthenics in here.

44:48.086 --> 44:50.716
Well, I'll stay in bed,
if you don't mind.

44:51.146 --> 44:55.206
No, but I don't particularly
want you watching.

44:55.599 --> 44:57.380
Why? What does
callisthenics involve?

44:57.381 --> 44:58.385
Nothing.

45:01.294 --> 45:03.755
But it's mine,
it's my little hour,

45:03.780 --> 45:04.896
all to myself.

45:07.132 --> 45:09.419
- Well, I'll be asleep.
- But you won't.

45:10.530 --> 45:13.404
And we've only got the
one room you'll be staring.

45:15.394 --> 45:19.443
So I thought you could get up at
six and go for a coffee and come back

45:19.476 --> 45:21.256
- at seven, is that all right?
- Um...

45:23.039 --> 45:24.397
Yeah, if you want.

45:24.703 --> 45:25.707
Thanks.

45:30.763 --> 45:31.990
Is that every day?

45:32.347 --> 45:33.351
Yes.

45:35.394 --> 45:36.398
Okay.

45:44.234 --> 45:46.796
OK, transport 3,000
euros per person.

45:46.821 --> 45:48.825
So, 6,000 total.

45:48.949 --> 45:52.973
Okay, but I refuse to give you
the money until we're on the boat.

45:52.998 --> 45:54.085
You pay now.

45:54.110 --> 45:57.592
Yes, I understand, but I want
to wait until I can see the boat.

45:57.617 --> 45:59.093
No, you have to pay now.

45:59.118 --> 46:01.378
Look, this has happened
before and we have been robbed.

46:01.403 --> 46:03.374
Unfortunate! You pay now.

46:03.399 --> 46:05.203
Well, I absolutely refuse.

46:05.539 --> 46:06.843
Okay, good luck.

46:06.868 --> 46:07.948
We finish.

46:08.704 --> 46:10.663
No, no, no, just
wait, wait, wait, wait!

46:10.688 --> 46:11.993
Just... look.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.580
I'll pay half.

46:14.605 --> 46:15.688
You give all.

46:22.329 --> 46:23.333
Okay.

46:42.409 --> 46:43.496
<i>C'est le jour du vote,</i>

46:43.520 --> 46:46.097
<i>et les sondages prÃ©voient
un choc immense.</i>

47:06.025 --> 47:07.029
That's him.

47:08.381 --> 47:09.934
- Yes!
- Come on, get the bag.

47:12.888 --> 47:14.288
Allez, on se dÃ©pÃªche!

47:14.313 --> 47:16.387
S'il n'y a pas de place,
vous restez debout!

47:16.412 --> 47:17.745
Allez, on se bouge!

47:28.614 --> 47:32.403
It said Cran de Quette.
It's a bit of headland.

47:33.246 --> 47:34.817
Hey, do you see?

47:35.166 --> 47:39.032
We're actually closer to
England now. More like 20 miles.

47:45.574 --> 47:46.574
C'est par-lÃ .

47:51.231 --> 47:53.278
Allez, on bouge. Plus
vite! Allez, allez, allez!

47:53.587 --> 47:54.700
Is that the boat?

47:55.795 --> 47:57.595
That's not the boat that
takes us to the boat?

47:58.225 --> 47:59.350
No, I think that's it.

48:00.580 --> 48:01.580
Okay.

48:02.114 --> 48:04.207
Well, never mind,
good. 20 miles that's all.

48:04.232 --> 48:05.683
Gilet de sauvetage, allez.

48:05.708 --> 48:06.712
20 miles.

48:06.737 --> 48:08.355
Allez, on se bouge! On se bouge.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.621
Eh vous, n'oubliez pas.

48:10.207 --> 48:11.730
Allez, vite, vite!

48:14.095 --> 48:16.871
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

48:16.896 --> 48:18.296
Hold that, hold that.

48:20.004 --> 48:21.903
Danny, what are you doing?

48:21.928 --> 48:23.708
I'm keeping them dry
you should do the same.

48:24.763 --> 48:26.384
Danny, look, we're
going to get wet.

48:26.409 --> 48:29.010
No, but I've worked with people,
I've seen this, you get foot rot.

48:56.418 --> 48:58.382
Come over, come on!

49:11.296 --> 49:12.300
Oh, shit!

49:15.534 --> 49:17.272
Oh, they're not getting
on board, are they?

49:18.624 --> 49:21.100
There must be another boat,
there's got to be another boat!

49:27.918 --> 49:31.249
There is no room!
There's no room!

49:31.449 --> 49:34.105
There's not enough room,
you can see, you can see,

49:34.130 --> 49:35.730
there's not enough room!

49:45.609 --> 49:50.770
Oh, shit! OK, budge up,
budge up! No, no. Wait!

49:50.997 --> 49:54.121
It doesn't matter, doesn't
matter! Come. Come.

50:01.637 --> 50:04.239
Danny, we can get
off. We can get off.

50:04.264 --> 50:09.257
- No, we can do this. We can do it.
- No, no.

50:16.307 --> 50:17.807
Vas-y, dÃ©marre le bÃ¢teau!

50:17.947 --> 50:19.014
Vas-y, dÃ©marre!

50:19.191 --> 50:20.596
Vas-y, c'est bon, dÃ©marre!

51:52.948 --> 51:54.201
Are you on your own?

51:57.079 --> 51:58.225
What's your name?

52:03.849 --> 52:05.421
Have you got any
paperwork with you?

52:15.257 --> 52:16.554
Where have you come from?

52:35.742 --> 52:40.702
<i>Astonishing day, astonishing
day, astonishing day!</i>

54:01.739 --> 54:02.739
Call link.

54:03.814 --> 54:06.680
No, call family
link, audio only.

54:06.705 --> 54:08.382
<i>Calling family link.</i>

54:11.745 --> 54:13.847
Danny, have you seen
the news over here?

54:13.872 --> 54:16.324
Your favourite
woman Prime Minister!

54:16.349 --> 54:17.628
I've actually met her.

54:17.690 --> 54:21.697
I love it, she's a nightmare,
the whole system's in pieces.

54:21.722 --> 54:24.558
Oh, Dan, mate, no,
take me off the family link.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.206
We've got to catch up.

54:26.231 --> 54:28.157
A lot of things have
changed since you went away.

54:28.352 --> 54:29.402
<i>Sorry, Celeste.</i>

54:29.427 --> 54:31.738
I don't mind. It doesn't
bother me, you stay on the link.

54:32.347 --> 54:34.635
Just do what you want.
You're very fond of saying

54:34.660 --> 54:35.832
it's your family.

54:35.857 --> 54:36.989
<i>Don't start.</i>

54:37.059 --> 54:38.598
Excuse me!

54:38.895 --> 54:42.729
I think, if anyone started
this, it was you, Stephen.

54:42.754 --> 54:45.520
Can I just point out... Daniel
left his husband for someone else,

54:45.545 --> 54:46.871
<i>no-one had a go at him.</i>

54:46.896 --> 54:48.418
<i>Me, it's the end of the world.</i>

54:48.747 --> 54:49.808
<i>Why is that?</i>

54:50.168 --> 54:51.406
I thought I'd better say.

54:51.582 --> 54:55.012
Oh, Viktor, sorry, are you okay?

54:55.094 --> 54:56.628
Hello! Where are you?

54:56.653 --> 54:58.724
Oh, Vik, mate, do us
a favour put Daniel on.

54:58.951 --> 54:59.951
It's a long story.

55:00.008 --> 55:01.763
Wait, sorry, but it
says you're home.

55:02.318 --> 55:04.155
You're phoning from Uncle
Dan's. You're in Britain?

55:04.179 --> 55:05.982
Oh, my God, no way!

55:06.007 --> 55:07.035
You did it.

55:07.204 --> 55:08.220
How did that happen?

55:08.245 --> 55:10.060
<i>Oh, that's brilliant!</i>

55:10.085 --> 55:11.958
That's amazing! How
did you do it, Dan?

55:14.111 --> 55:15.677
Danny, are you there?

55:17.942 --> 55:19.880
I'm at the house
and Daniel's dead.

55:22.412 --> 55:23.872
<i>I'm sorry, but he drowned.</i>

55:25.864 --> 55:27.655
<i>We thought we could
get across the Channel,</i>

55:28.584 --> 55:30.826
<i>but on the news
it says 17 bodies...</i>

55:32.229 --> 55:33.295
<i>that was Daniel.</i>

55:34.226 --> 55:35.226
He's dead.

55:35.924 --> 55:36.928
<i>He drowned.</i>

55:38.326 --> 55:42.282
We got half a mile from the
shore, but that's a very long way.

55:44.237 --> 55:45.401
- What?
- <i>The police don't know.</i>

55:45.425 --> 55:48.185
<i>His passport was gone,
his wallet was in his bag,</i>

55:48.210 --> 55:49.404
<i>and his bag was lost.</i>

55:50.535 --> 55:55.092
<i>So, he's in a town on the
coast called Rye, unidentified.</i>

55:56.390 --> 55:57.545
<i>I didn't want to do that.</i>

55:59.483 --> 56:03.463
But I thought, if I came
here, they'd never find me.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.826
That doesn't work, I know.

56:10.221 --> 56:14.481
I apologise to you all,
but we got on the boat,

56:14.956 --> 56:16.090
and the boat sank.

56:17.163 --> 56:18.286
And he's dead.

56:21.907 --> 56:23.068
I came home.

56:24.646 --> 56:25.646
Is this home?

57:09.934 --> 57:10.938
Okay.

57:41.446 --> 57:43.376
Viktor, please, are you there?

57:44.970 --> 57:45.970
Viktor!

57:47.200 --> 57:48.376
Viktor?

57:48.476 --> 57:50.266
Open the door!

57:51.774 --> 57:52.915
Viktor!

57:54.206 --> 57:55.262
Viktor!
