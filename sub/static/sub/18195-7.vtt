00:11.280 --> 00:13.919
<i>This is the happiest day of my life.</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:17.311
<i>I love you, Rachel.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:20.198
This is the best day of my life!

00:20.280 --> 00:22.635
I love you, Adam!

00:25.040 --> 00:27.998
Right. Let's get this show
on the road, shall we?

00:31.840 --> 00:35.628
Wedding cake. You need to order it now,
so that it will arrive on time.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.631
I've made a list.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.952
Traditional fruit cake, lemon zest, chocolate
gateau, Victoria sponge and carrot cake.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.749
My advice, skip the carrot, no-one likes it.
It's a vegetable.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.554
Then you need to decide how many tiers,
what little figures to go on top.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.633
And whether you want it with ice cream,
raspberry coulis or creme Anglais.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.676
Could you go through that again, please?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.119
What is it?

01:03.200 --> 01:05.394
It's an electric wok for stir-fries.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.789
Haven't we got
a Chinese takeaway for stir-fries?

01:07.880 --> 01:10.997
It's either that or more towels.
- All this useless stuff!

01:11.080 --> 01:15.119
Adam! God, if you had your way, you'd
have our wedding list at an off-licence!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.918
That's not a bad idea.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.150
Put it on the list.
- I'll put it on the list.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.151
Can we go home now?

01:21.240 --> 01:23.708
''Marquee Magic - our top tent hits.''

01:25.120 --> 01:27.793
''Bridal bouquets - we pick five
of the best.''

01:27.880 --> 01:32.670
There's an article here on confetti, for Christ's
sake! Who reads this bollocks, apart from us?

01:36.160 --> 01:38.720
Nice article on bridal lingerie, though.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.916
Ow! What?

01:45.880 --> 01:47.836
What is it?

01:47.920 --> 01:49.876
It's an electric wok...

01:49.960 --> 01:51.871
for stir-fries.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.077
What do they want that for?
- It's either that or towels.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.914
They wouldn't have put it on the
wedding list if they didn't want it.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.480 --> 02:08.708
See you later.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.792
Hold on, please, Adam.
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.836
What?

02:13.920 --> 02:15.876
The list.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.916
Oh, God! Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.956
I put it here somewhere.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.996
Yeah. There you are.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.036
On the back of a Chinese menu?

02:24.120 --> 02:26.315
I make it 24 people. What about you?

02:26.400 --> 02:28.356
143.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.356
You're joking!

02:31.440 --> 02:34.955
You're not joking?
- 143 is my absolute minimum.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.669
But that's like 167 guests.
I don't even know that many people.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.433
Adam, it's our wedding.
What did you think it would be like?

02:41.520 --> 02:44.478
What's wrong with a few close mates,
some drinks, a bit of a laugh?

02:44.560 --> 02:47.233
Maybe some ten-pin bowling.
Back here for a curry and a vid?

02:47.320 --> 02:50.471
Adam, I don't think
you're taking this wedding seriously.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.198
I am!

02:52.280 --> 02:53.793
Fooksy, Carsey, Spence.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.917
Do you know anyone with a proper name?
- They're my mates!

02:57.000 --> 03:00.879
Bucket, Bazza, Tommo. It's the cast
of Grange Hill. Where's your parents?

03:00.960 --> 03:05.795
My parents hate each other's guts! I don't want
to watch them throw chairs at each other!

03:05.880 --> 03:08.394
Mine are hardly easy.
- So, don't invite them!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.550
Why don't we spend the day
with people we like?

03:10.640 --> 03:12.949
Don't be rude about my parents.
- Why not? You are!

03:13.040 --> 03:16.112
I'm allowed to. They're my parents.
Of course I'm inviting them.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.952
That's what weddings are for.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.158
I don't see why we're getting married
if all we do is just act embarrassed about it!

03:22.240 --> 03:24.356
Huh? This is ridiculous.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.159
I can't stay and argue.
I've got to go and meet Pete.

03:27.240 --> 03:31.518
Fine. You go down the pub. I will do
everything. You can just turn up on the day.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.878
For your information,
Pete is very, very depressed.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.235
I'm going to the pub to cheer him up, OK?

03:37.920 --> 03:40.559
I'm over the bloody moon!
- I'm made up for you.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.313
She's fantastic. She's gorgeous.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.550
Do you know what's really under-rated?

03:45.640 --> 03:47.517
Drinking on your own?
- No, kissing.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.239
I mean, top-flight kissing.
Premier league kissing.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.756
You kiss the same person for the rest
of your life, it becomes boring.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.152
Dull, routine, a habit like shaking hands.
You kiss someone new, it's mind-blowing.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.312
It's like the nerve endings in your mouth,
they come alive.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.951
Do you know what, we were kissing the
other day, non-stop for about...three hours.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.639
When we finished kissing, she had
this funny little eczema mark on her mouth.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.631
She's a very lucky lady.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.598
Oh, yes, she is.
I'd forgotten how good a kisser I am.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.229
Not too hard, not too soft,
not too wet but tender, inquisitive.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.912
Can we change the subject?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.276
And we talk, really talk.
She's into me and what I've got to say.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.873
Bizarre.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.838
I keep expecting her to glaze over,
but she doesn't.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.037
It's not just idle chit-chat.
It's big stuff. Universal issues.

04:56.120 --> 05:02.095
If mankind truly has free will,
rather than the illusion of free will,

05:02.280 --> 05:07.434
then surely, religious faith...
is a delusion.

05:07.520 --> 05:11.798
Take, for example, a tree falling
in the forest.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.519
Good point, well made.
- Wait, it gets better.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.479
The way I see it, the team's weakness
is in our back four and it always has been.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.473
You can have the best strikers in the world,
but if you're scared to push forward...

05:22.560 --> 05:24.516
What?

05:25.560 --> 05:29.030
We're actually dating in the daytime now,
without alcohol or anything.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.350
Sober dating, my God! What did you do?

05:31.440 --> 05:34.989
Walked through the park. Played Pooh-sticks.
- Pooh-sticks?

05:35.080 --> 05:37.992
You get two sticks, right.
Stand on the edge of a bridge.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.115
Aw!

05:44.520 --> 05:46.476
<i>I know what Pooh-sticks is.</i>

05:46.640 --> 05:49.791
My God, you're smitten, aren't you?
You're in deep smit!

05:49.880 --> 05:52.075
I know. It's like I've found the Holy Grail:

05:52.160 --> 05:55.869
intelligent, attractive, affectionate woman,
who's not that fussed!

05:55.960 --> 05:58.474
I'm very happy for you.
- Well, you don't sound it.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.711
Oh, I am. I am, I am, I am, I am, I'm sorry.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.236
It's just Rachel and I
are arguing about the wedding again.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.836
Well, they do say it's one of the four
most stressful things you do in life.

06:09.920 --> 06:10.796
After?

06:10.880 --> 06:12.836
Moving house.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.672
Divorce.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.079
Death.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.071
But it shouldn't be, though, should it?

06:18.160 --> 06:21.152
It should be fun.
Instead, we're arguing like...

06:21.240 --> 06:23.390
a married couple.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.516
You were the one
who got that engagement ring.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.068
Well, that's another of the problems.
- What?

06:28.160 --> 06:31.118
I still haven't bought her
the engagement ring.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.156
Glad you called me, Adam.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.879
Jewellery is a terribly important
investment.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.916
You shouldn't rush in uninformed.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.956
So, which one's the best?

06:40.040 --> 06:41.792
There isn't really a best.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.589
It's not as if you're buying hi-fi
equipment. It's just a matter of taste.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.636
So, what about that one?

06:48.720 --> 06:50.676
No, that's far too cheap.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.271
You think that's too cheap?

06:54.360 --> 06:57.113
Well, you are supposed to spend
a month's salary.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.158
One month's salary? You're kidding.
Who says that?

07:00.240 --> 07:01.992
The jewellers.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.230
One month's worth of my current salary?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.788
Why can't I spend one month's
worth of Pete's?

07:07.880 --> 07:09.836
Do you mind? I do all right, me.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.876
What if I spend less?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.712
That's fine, but it is traditional.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.115
And it's a symbol of your love and devotion.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.197
All right, then. In that case...
Come here, come here.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.714
In that case, what about that one?

07:23.800 --> 07:26.189
Which one?
- That one. That's a beauty!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.236
Is that really how much you earn?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.959
Well, no. Not quite. That's
two months' salary!

07:32.040 --> 07:34.713
But can you afford it?
- Well, no, of course not.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.473
But Rachel's worth it, just about.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.516
What do you think?

07:39.600 --> 07:44.037
It's very glamorous. But do you really think
you should be buying jewellery by the pound?

07:44.120 --> 07:47.715
Absolutely. If I'm spending that much,
I want her to know about it.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.391
Oi, come here, you, I want a word.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.436
Don't start, Pete, please.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.476
Have you knocked it on the head yet?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.118
No, not yet.

07:57.200 --> 08:00.112
You mean you're still seeing her?
- I haven't even spoken to her.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.875
Well, you need to speak to her.
- Do I? Can't I just not return her calls?

08:03.960 --> 08:05.916
No. You have to arrange a meeting

08:06.000 --> 08:09.390
where you tell her firmly and politely
that this whole thing is over.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.074
Otherwise, she'll turn up at your house
out of the blue.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.388
No, she wouldn't do that.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.391
<i>Darling, I'm home!</i>

08:16.480 --> 08:18.038
Something smells good.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.312
Ahhh!

08:23.400 --> 08:25.356
Yeah, you're right. I will call her.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.635
Is yours on solids yet?

08:33.720 --> 08:35.676
Not just yet, no.

08:35.760 --> 08:41.039
Little Polly Peachums had her first solids
last night, didn't you, bu-bu-bu-bunny?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.076
Nice firm stools?
- Me or the baby?

08:43.159 --> 08:44.593
Sorry.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.593
Ah, look at her tiny, weeny, little toes.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.477
They're so small.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.949
Of course she's got small feet.
She's a baby.

08:53.040 --> 08:57.795
She's hardly likely to have flapping great size
tens! Please, girls, can we just face facts here?

08:57.880 --> 09:00.713
There's nothing more boring
than other people's babies.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.475
They poo, they sleep, they poo, they sleep
they grab hold of your little finger.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.030
They occasionally vomit. They are all
the same and they are all boring.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.998
Except your baby.
Your baby is both boring and ugly.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.908
Don't suppose anyone's got a fag on them,
have they? Chin-chin.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.468
Karen, you didn't?
- No, of course I didn't.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.516
I was very polite, very interested.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.071
And we talked about chapped nipples
and bowel movements and sleeping patterns.

09:28.160 --> 09:33.029
It was the local branch of the Stepford
Wives, David. I was bored out of my skull.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.269
How was your day?

09:34.360 --> 09:35.713
Is that gin?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.153
Yeah.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.196
You know where the vases are.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.236
Are you still angry with me?

09:44.320 --> 09:46.675
It'll take more than a few lilies, you know.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.916
Rach, come here to me.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.956
No.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.116
Rach, look at me.
- No.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.270
Aren't you meant to promise to obey me?

10:08.360 --> 10:11.989
Not yet, mate. Anyway, promising to obey
went out a long time ago.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.036
Not in Ireland.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.836
Look...

10:20.280 --> 10:23.750
I just wanted to say how sorry I am

10:23.840 --> 10:26.195
for not pulling my weight with the wedding.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.436
And that I adore you

10:29.520 --> 10:34.355
and that I'm desperate, absolutely gagging
to marry you with as much fuss as possible,

10:34.440 --> 10:36.874
in front of as many people as you want.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.869
And to show you how serious I am,

10:41.960 --> 10:43.712
this...

10:44.760 --> 10:46.478
..is for you.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.312
Is this what I think it is?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.356
Might be.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.196
Oh, my God!

10:56.280 --> 10:58.111
Oh, my God!

10:58.200 --> 11:00.156
Do you like it?

11:01.200 --> 11:05.273
Adam, I think it's absolutely incredible.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.752
It's incredible.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.270
It is, isn't it?
- Really something.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.796
God, yeah. - Must have gone to
loads of trouble getting that.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.632
How do you mean?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.871
You try finding Christmas crackers
at this time of year!

11:20.960 --> 11:22.916
Jenny, it's not funny.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.956
Well, I like it.
- Yeah, so so I.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.157
I think it's a good, fun engagement ring.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.277
I'm just mucking about.
Let's have another look at it.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.316
What's the stone, then?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.356
Kidney stone, I think.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.432
God, do you remember that awful brooch
that David bought me that time?

11:41.520 --> 11:44.910
Oh, that one with that bit of
his hair in it.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.639
That was actually truly disgusting,
wasn't it?

11:47.720 --> 11:50.757
Well, you know what? I love it. I do.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.796
Good, that's the important thing.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.031
I mean, obviously,
he didn't spend much money on it,

11:56.120 --> 11:58.759
but I don't want
an expensive engagement ring.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.195
And, anyway, it's the thought that counts.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.236
I'm sure I will come to love it.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.276
Yeah, I think you will.

12:05.360 --> 12:10.229
I will, won't I? I mean, you don't think
it'll be an albatross around my neck?

12:10.320 --> 12:14.279
Except an albatross around her neck
would actually have looked nicer!

12:14.360 --> 12:16.316
Poor Rach. What is she going to do?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.278
I think if it was me,
I'd just come out with it and say,

12:19.360 --> 12:23.831
''Adam, I think that's beautiful, I love it,
now give us the bloody till receipt.''

12:23.920 --> 12:25.876
Mm-hm.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.428
Have you just listened to anything
I've said?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.909
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.470
Yeah, on Find A Fortune.
Don't break your concentration.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.677
I was thinking about work, actually.
Eh, I was watching that!

12:37.760 --> 12:40.228
Have you got any interest in
my friends at all?

12:42.680 --> 12:44.636
No, not really.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.756
I don't care about Rachel's ring.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.308
I couldn't give a toss
where the wedding's going to be.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.868
In fact, I might not even go
to the wedding myself.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.916
Not going?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.151
No, why should I? Your friends
couldn't care less if I did or not.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.630
They're rude, they're self-satisfied.
They look straight through me.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.790
Karen's the only one that makes an effort.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.838
To everyone else
I'm just a bloke for Pete to glare at.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.434
It's not that bad.
- It is, Jen.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.829
Adam's still calling me Richard,
for Christ's sake.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.357
I know he's doing it to piss me off.
Funny thing is, it's really starting to work.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.874
Listen, Pete and I were together
a long time.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.916
They're bound to be a bit...

13:21.000 --> 13:22.672
Hostile? Indifferent?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.716
Wary.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.236
Fancy a cup of tea, Richard?

13:31.280 --> 13:33.236
Ha, ha.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.276
Yes.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.556
What exactly are we playing at?
- You'll see. It's a surprise!

13:41.640 --> 13:43.596
A nice surprise?

13:43.680 --> 13:45.238
That depends.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.834
OK. Take it off.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.236
What do you think?

13:54.320 --> 13:56.276
It's very nice. What about it?

13:56.360 --> 13:58.316
This is it. This is the surprise.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.356
What, we've joined the National Trust?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.271
He doesn't get it.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.316
It's where you're getting married!

14:07.080 --> 14:09.036
I don't think so.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.076
No, seriously. Tell him, Jen.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.116
We've tried everywhere.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.715
The only thing left is scout huts
or the back of pubs, apart from here.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.597
They had a last-minute cancellation.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.831
It's all available two weeks from now.
What do you think?

14:21.920 --> 14:24.354
I think you've both gone completely insane!

14:26.280 --> 14:28.236
No, Adam! Wait, wait.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.198
Just imagine it, just for a minute.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.829
OK. We have the ceremony over by the lake...

14:36.880 --> 14:42.079
Late afternoon, everybody all dressed up,
looking out over the water as we make our vows.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.630
Then the sound of champagne corks popping...

14:45.720 --> 14:47.517
And...

14:47.600 --> 14:49.352
a string quartet playing...

14:49.440 --> 14:53.149
And children running about the lawn,
playing games.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.677
And then as the sun sets,
we all sit down under the marquee

14:57.760 --> 15:00.399
and drink and laugh and eat.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.632
Nothing fancy, you know, just a buffet,
but loads of champagne...

15:05.720 --> 15:08.075
Sparkling wine maybe.

15:08.160 --> 15:12.199
And then, as the sun rises,
we ride off onto our honeymoon

15:12.280 --> 15:16.990
with the sound of music and laughter
still ringing in the night air.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.036
Ow!
- How much?

15:20.080 --> 15:22.833
Well, obviously, it's not going to
be cheap, is it?

15:22.920 --> 15:24.876
But, Adam, it's once in a lifetime.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.916
Twice, technically.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.594
How much?
- I'm sure we could get a loan.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.636
Rachel?
- OK.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.676
Here's a quote.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.513
150 people...with buffet.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.431
What do you think?

15:39.920 --> 15:42.354
Is this to rent it or buy it?

15:54.680 --> 15:57.194
I'm probably going to regret this.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.396
OK. You win.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.835
Are you sure?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.319
Course. Let's do it.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.670
Thank you! That's brilliant!

16:07.760 --> 16:10.228
Ow, ow, ow!
God, your ring's stuck in my hair.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.916
Sorry.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.752
It's nice, though, isn't it?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.552
Thank you.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.279
You have beautiful lips.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.590
Or you have sexy eyes.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.112
And an adverb is a word
that describes a verb or an action.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.679
You smile radiantly.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.716
You dance brilliantly.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.597
You er...

16:34.680 --> 16:36.432
you smell lovely.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.957
Sort of. Except in that case the word smell
is not something I'm actually doing.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.919
It's an intransitive verb.
So, it's got two meanings, you see.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.956
Right.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.679
I wish I'd had a teacher like you
when I was a kid.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.393
Do you want to go to bed?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.436
No, no, it's...

17:01.520 --> 17:03.476
it's well early.

17:03.560 --> 17:07.155
It's not even ten yet.
No, you can stay for a bit if you want to.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.913
No, I meant with me.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.955
Oh, right.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.916
Yeah. Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.955
He said, reluctantly.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.031
No, no, it's not like that.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.076
Oh, I don't know how to put this.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.429
I think... I think you're brilliant.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.476
I think you're gorgeous.

17:29.800 --> 17:34.078
It's just...I can't help
but think this is some sort of bet or...

17:34.160 --> 17:36.754
or a practical joke, you know.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.796
Pete,

17:38.880 --> 17:41.713
will you stop putting yourself down?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.756
Look, it's like this. I...

17:46.280 --> 17:52.628
I haven't been to bed with anyone
except Jenny for 15 years

17:52.720 --> 17:54.551
and to be honest...

17:55.640 --> 17:57.596
..I'm a bit nervous.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.349
Whoa, whoa,
aren't you forgetting something here?

18:01.440 --> 18:04.591
What? - Isn't this a slight rewriting
of history, lover boy?

18:04.680 --> 18:08.195
Why? - The small matter of you
having had an affair.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.478
You weren't so coy and virginal then.
- I'm hardly going to tell her that, am I?

18:12.560 --> 18:15.120
I'm not stupid. This is different.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.668
I know it's early days, but I think
me and Emma,

18:17.760 --> 18:21.196
we've got a future together
and I don't want to go and spoil it.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.635
By sleeping with her?
- Exactly.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.437
I'll tell you something terrible, right.

18:30.520 --> 18:35.594
When I first went out with Robert,
around the third date, something like that,

18:35.680 --> 18:39.036
I was thinking to myself,
just to see what it sounded like...

18:39.120 --> 18:41.076
Jenny Brown.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.076
Mrs Jenny Brown.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.628
He flies me off to New York
and buys me all them flowers.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.598
And frankly I'm deciding how many kids
we're having

18:50.680 --> 18:53.433
and the design
on my ''Robert loves Jenny'' tattoo.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.399
Three months later, we haven't got
a bloody thing to say to each other.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.436
Sounds familiar.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.875
He is still coming to the wedding, isn't he?

19:01.960 --> 19:06.112
What wedding?
Oh, my God, sorry, your wedding!

19:06.200 --> 19:09.237
Right, wouldn't miss it for the world.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.552
A-ha!

19:14.640 --> 19:17.074
What is it about women and weddings, anyway?

19:17.160 --> 19:19.116
The slightest whiff of confetti

19:19.200 --> 19:22.272
and Rachel turns into
this bouquet-wielding monster.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.036
That engagement ring cleared me out

19:26.120 --> 19:28.588
and now we're hiring this ridiculous castle.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.434
And it's all ice sculptures
and six different kinds of bread rolls.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.233
I keep expecting to find out
it's being televised!

19:37.280 --> 19:41.910
I mean, do you have any idea
just how much a string quartet costs?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.753
Can't say I do. How about a trio?

19:44.840 --> 19:46.796
Hey, what do you think?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.230
Can't you wear the one you wear for work?

19:53.320 --> 19:55.276
I'll get it dry-cleaned.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.836
Nice place, don't you think?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.876
Mm. No windows.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.518
What?

20:07.600 --> 20:10.239
Discreet. No-one can look in and see us.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.476
Don't worry, David.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.596
I'm not going to cry.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.636
I've been in hell since...

20:19.720 --> 20:21.676
..what happened happened.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.349
Not that it wasn't exciting.
I don't regret it for a second.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.954
You just wish it had never happened.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.316
I love Karen and I don't want to do
anything else to hurt her.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.111
Sometimes, you know, I just find myself
longing for a huge, great big bloody row.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.228
Spice things up a bit, get things out in
the open, make it a bit more interesting.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.911
Hey, that's my car!

20:48.000 --> 20:51.276
The cheeky bastard is stealing my car! Oi!

20:51.360 --> 20:53.555
Karen!

20:54.640 --> 20:56.073
Oi!

21:00.040 --> 21:01.393
Karen!

21:04.960 --> 21:07.349
What's she doing?
- Karen, you won't catch him!

21:07.440 --> 21:09.396
Oi!

21:12.480 --> 21:14.436
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.238
Oi!

21:51.680 --> 21:53.636
Go on, Karen!

21:56.160 --> 21:58.116
Go on, Karen!

22:01.360 --> 22:03.032
I thank you.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.274
To be honest, I'm quite angry
with you, David.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.476
I mean, not calling me.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.030
What did you think I was going to do?
Turn up at your house and kill your rabbits?

22:14.120 --> 22:15.473
Argh!

22:15.560 --> 22:17.630
No, of course not.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.915
What we did was fun, but it wasn't
that much fun.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.438
If you brought me here to tell me
that you were leaving your wife,

22:25.520 --> 22:28.193
I'd have run out of the nearest fire exit.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.635
I sort of knew there was no future in it.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.950
But I still think it's a shame.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.917
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.434
What?
- It's Jenny's boyfriend Robert.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.476
Hide! Hide in the toilets!

22:41.560 --> 22:43.391
I am not hiding in the toilets.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.756
And that's why this merger
is such great news for the company.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.434
Just stay calm, it's perfectly innocent.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.476
David.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.437
Robert. How are you?

22:55.520 --> 22:57.431
I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.954
This is Sarah, a business associate of mine.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.600
This is Jessica, my colleague
from the office.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.238
Pleased to meet you.

23:04.320 --> 23:07.471
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll see you back at the office.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.476
Goodbye, David.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.516
Thanks for lunch.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.431
Bye, see you at the office.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.756
Jessica! Jessica!

23:26.840 --> 23:28.831
I'm so sorry about that.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.672
At least you know it won't happen again.

23:30.760 --> 23:34.594
Be a shame to get caught with your pants down,
when you've almost got away with it.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.035
It's not a question of getting away with it.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.753
Please, let's not leave it like this.
Can't we go somewhere else and talk?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.796
You're a nice man, David.

23:44.880 --> 23:50.352
But you can also be an insensitive,
patronising, cowardly little prick.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.396
Goodbye.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.236
I'm so sorry!

23:59.480 --> 24:01.436
Good meeting?

24:02.480 --> 24:04.436
Pretty much, yeah.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.636
David, it's not what it seems, you know.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.234
She's just an old friend.
- Yes, of course.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.630
I wouldn't do anything like that to Jenny.
- I'm sure you wouldn't.

24:12.720 --> 24:16.156
So it's probably best
if we just keep this to ourselves, yeah?

24:17.680 --> 24:19.636
Yes. Yes, I understand.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.676
Glass houses, stones and all that.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.038
Exactly. You seem to know the drill.
You've not done bad there, though, mate.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.311
Well, if I may say so,
I think Jenny deserves a lot better.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.675
I could say the same thing about your wife.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.433
Hi.

24:44.520 --> 24:48.195
David, it's me. Where the hell have you been?
I've been calling your office.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.236
No, it's not the twins, David.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.276
It's me.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.676
I've been arrested.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.716
An assault charge.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.956
My own wife. A criminal record.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.996
I'm sure the jury will acquit her.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.036
Why didn't you stop her, Rach?

25:09.280 --> 25:11.236
I was too scared.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.675
I mean, she can get really angry, can't she?

25:13.760 --> 25:15.716
Yeah.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.756
Yeah, she can.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.114
Well, I'm just sorry I wasn't
there to see it.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.917
Maybe she could help out
with security at the wedding?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.956
In case things get out of hand.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.996
Just an idea.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.430
Oh, here she comes. The Altrincham One!

25:39.880 --> 25:41.836
Are you all right? What's happened?

25:41.920 --> 25:45.071
I'm absolutely fine.
They let me off with a reprimand.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.232
Which, if you ask me, is an
absolute disgrace.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.158
I'm very sorry, officer. This will not
happen again.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.916
Thanks. That was lovely.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.398
Do you not think
that's a little bit advanced for him, Pete?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.630
No. You can handle it, can't you, tiger?

26:08.720 --> 26:11.473
It's little bits of plastic that
he's going to eat.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.518
You might as well have given him
a set of steak knives.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.556
That is absolute rubbish.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.234
Kids love a challenge, don't you?

26:20.320 --> 26:22.880
Who told you that, your teacher friend?
- No.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.236
How is Miss Jean Brodie, anyway?

26:31.040 --> 26:33.315
Why do you always have to do this?
- What?

26:33.400 --> 26:34.753
You know!

26:35.840 --> 26:37.796
Adam.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.952
Why don't you go and watch telly
in the other room, mate?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.996
Yeah? Good boy. Go on.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.236
Jen,

26:56.320 --> 26:58.880
I think we need to have a serious
conversation.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.992
Sounds a bit scary.
What is it, your GCSE options?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.356
I think we should get divorced.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.636
Right.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.676
Oh, dear.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.992
Well, I've got to say, Pete, after all these
years, you're still full of surprises.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.036
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

27:21.120 --> 27:23.475
I mean, that's what happens
when people break up.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.516
Yeah.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.751
I just don't know what the bloody hurry is
all of a sudden.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.673
Haven't got that poor girl pregnant, I hope?
- No.

27:31.760 --> 27:35.639
I think it's just time for a change.
You're with Robert, I'm with Emma.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.393
It's time to put the past behind us.
It's time...

27:38.480 --> 27:40.436
..time to move on.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.636
Jenny, sit down, please.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.236
This has to happen.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.072
Right.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.912
Good.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.116
Oh, they let your mummy out of prison.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.116
Hello, my darlings.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.876
Hello.

28:09.080 --> 28:13.835
Ramona, I'd prefer it if you didn't mention
any of this assault business in front of Josh.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.878
Why not? You should have seen her, David.
She was so brave.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.918
You should be proud of her.
- Why, thank you, Ramona.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.956
I just don't want Josh worrying.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.191
For goodness' sake, David,
I lost my temper, that's all.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.350
What if something had happened to you?

28:27.440 --> 28:29.670
What if the man had been armed? What then?

28:31.680 --> 28:35.309
You're a mother, Karen.
You've responsibilities to the family.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.113
You cannot behave recklessly like this
any more.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.753
Would you excuse us for a moment, please,
Ramona?

28:42.840 --> 28:44.796
Will you be OK?
- Yeah.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.836
I'll be up in a minute. Bye-bye.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.876
Why did you marry me, David?

28:56.920 --> 28:58.831
What?

28:58.920 --> 29:02.549
For the sake of argument, please remind me.
What did you see in me?

29:02.640 --> 29:06.235
Did I actually have
any discernible personality of my own?

29:06.320 --> 29:08.754
Was I sexy? Was I attractive?
Did I make you laugh?

29:09.840 --> 29:14.038
Or was I just good, strong, reliable stock
to continue the Marsden family name?

29:15.120 --> 29:17.429
I married you because I loved you.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.238
Oh, is that ''loved you'' past tense?

29:19.320 --> 29:21.276
Oh, this is absurd.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.636
Because what I did today
might have been stupid and irresponsible

29:24.720 --> 29:26.950
but at least it wasn't sensible or reliable.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.396
You have absolutely no concern
about my well-being whatsoever, do you?

29:30.480 --> 29:34.553
Your only concern was that
the twins might miss their six o'clock feed,

29:34.640 --> 29:36.756
as if I was some kind of bloody
milking machine!

29:36.840 --> 29:39.274
That is absolutely not true.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.715
I was desperately concerned about you.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.756
Then why don't you show it?

29:44.440 --> 29:46.112
My god!

29:48.880 --> 29:50.836
We never talk any more.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.672
We barely make love.

29:53.720 --> 29:57.395
I've got no idea what you're thinking,
what's going on in your life. None at all.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.639
You act like you're scared of me, and do
you know what, I'm bored of you. Really bored.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.278
We never used to be like this, did we?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.836
Karen.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.350
Listen.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.473
We're obviously just going through
a rough patch.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.236
All marriages have them.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.153
It's been like this for an awfully
long time, David.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.196
Yes, I know.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.236
I am sorry.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.236
I'm sorry.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.236
So what are we going to do?

30:55.760 --> 30:58.228
Excuse me. Excuse me!

30:58.320 --> 31:00.072
Ol.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.878
Are you talking to me?

31:01.960 --> 31:03.678
Are you Miss Keaton's new fella?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.751
I might be. Who wants to know?

31:05.840 --> 31:08.513
She said your breath smells like fish paste.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.354
Yeah, well, yours smells of dog muck!
Cos I can smell it from here.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.034
No, that's your mum's breath.
- That's your mum's breath.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.554
Come here and say that!
- Are you gonna make me?

31:17.640 --> 31:21.792
You don't make rubbish. It just happens.
- Are you talking to me or are you chewing a...

31:21.880 --> 31:23.836
Everything all right, Pete?

31:23.920 --> 31:25.876
Have you not got homes to go to?

31:25.960 --> 31:27.916
Yes, Miss.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.036
Sorry about that.
- That's OK.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.872
So what do you want to do?

31:32.960 --> 31:36.919
Well, I was gonna take you for something to
eat, but they've nicked my dinner money.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.636
What are you doing?

31:50.720 --> 31:52.676
Nothing.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.716
You just smell nice, that's all.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.756
Pervert.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.756
You got any tea here?
- Mm-hm.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.952
What are you playing at, then? Stop sniffing
me and go and make us a cup of tea.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.836
And Pete...
- What?

32:09.880 --> 32:11.836
Come back to bed.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.836
I'll put the kettle on.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.716
Say something, Jen.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.636
Sorry, I'm just sort of taking it in.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.756
I haven't been chucked since I was 12.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.796
I don't really know what to say.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.717
Have you met somebody else? Honest?
- No. Honest, no.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.872
It's not about anybody else,
it's not about you either.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.916
It's...it's me.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.436
I just need some space.

32:51.280 --> 32:56.400
Sorry, is there any chance of you talking
in something other than cliches here?

32:56.480 --> 32:58.914
''It's not you, it's me.''

32:59.000 --> 33:01.070
''I need to move on, I need some space.''

33:01.160 --> 33:03.116
Bloody hell...

33:03.200 --> 33:04.315
It's how I feel, Jen.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.676
What is it about men and space anyway?
What do you do with it all?

33:07.760 --> 33:09.716
Do you just run around in it?

33:11.680 --> 33:14.478
Obviously, it's nothing
to do with me having a kid.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.790
No, of course not.
- No?

33:16.880 --> 33:19.519
Oh, go on, admit it, please!

33:19.600 --> 33:23.673
You know, it was fun, wasn't it,
playing at being a dad for a bit, and now...

33:23.760 --> 33:26.399
now the novelty's worn off,
you'd rather just duck out?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.436
No, not really.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.476
It's not that easy, you know, Jen.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.791
Most blokes, they wouldn't have got involved
in the first place.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.356
It's a big responsibility, you know.
- That is very big of you.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.396
Thank you so much.

33:41.480 --> 33:45.712
Now listen to me. My son is next door
and I don't want him to see you here

33:45.800 --> 33:50.555
and if it is such a big responsibility,
I'm going to have to ask you to piss off.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.679
Anything good?
- Bills. Bills. Bills.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.274
I wish they'd stop sending us Bill's mail.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.156
Why exactly am I marrying you?

34:00.240 --> 34:02.196
I have no idea.
- I'm off.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.714
Where are you going?
- Shopping.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.156
What, again? Oh, please, God,
tell me it's for a pint of milk.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.156
It's for bridesmaids' outfits.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.196
What? What's funny?

34:14.239 --> 34:16.993
It's just the idea of
Jenny and Karen as bridesmaids.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.708
Aren't they a little old or something?
Don't you have to be a virgin for that?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.233
Not necessarily.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.275
David could be a page boy.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.793
I bet he already owns a sailor suit.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.030
Have you contacted your parents?
- No.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.714
Have you ordered the cake?
- I'm doing it this afternoon.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.870
Well, then, there's lots for you to do.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.274
Who's paying for the bridesmaids' outfits?

34:38.360 --> 34:39.839
Bye!

34:39.920 --> 34:41.478
Rachel!

34:41.560 --> 34:43.516
What do you think?

34:48.480 --> 34:50.436
Great. The Beverley Sisters.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.192
Jenny.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.235
Well, you look gorgeous.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.275
You look really lovely.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.316
I just don't think it's very me.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.278
I mean, I look like a toilet dolly.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.635
It just needs taking out a bit, that's all.

35:03.720 --> 35:06.553
Yes, taken out and shot.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.191
Do you not think, Rach,
they're just a little bit dressy?

35:12.240 --> 35:15.312
OK. Take them off.
- Can't we just wear our own stuff?

35:15.400 --> 35:18.233
Fine. Let's all roll up in bloody
T-shirt and jeans.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.276
I didn't mean that.

35:20.360 --> 35:23.193
You know,
maybe I shouldn't have any bridesmaids.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.196
Rach...

35:29.080 --> 35:31.833
What?
- We're supposed to be helping her, Jenny.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.388
You can talk. You're hardly
the life and soul.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.914
Anyway, what are you going to do?
Assault me?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.956
What is wrong with you?

35:39.040 --> 35:40.792
Oh, I don't know. I just..

35:41.840 --> 35:43.717
I don't feel very bloody romantic.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.472
Why? What's happened?

35:45.560 --> 35:47.835
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

35:49.480 --> 35:51.436
I've lost my engagement ring!

36:08.880 --> 36:10.632
It's got to be somewhere.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.870
When did you last have it on, Rachel?

36:14.120 --> 36:17.954
It was last night. I remember
because I snagged another jumper on it.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.478
God, this is pointless.
It could be anywhere, couldn't it?

36:23.560 --> 36:25.516
It's probably on the street somewhere.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.034
Oh, God, can you just tell him?
- No, I cannot!

36:28.120 --> 36:32.159
He'll be absolutely furious. He loved
that ring. I am so stupid.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.196
I think you should own up, Rachel.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.276
It's not like it cost very much money.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.276
Yeah.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.198
Can I help you?

36:51.280 --> 36:53.430
Hi. Yes, you can. I'm looking for a ring.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.476
It's a very particular kind of ring.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.516
It's sort of...

36:58.600 --> 37:01.478
..sort of big with a large, central stone

37:01.560 --> 37:04.120
and lots of little red stones
surrounding it.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.156
Like this one?
- No. No.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.754
More tacky.
- More vulgar.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.478
Like this one?

37:11.560 --> 37:13.516
Yeah, similar.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.314
That! That's the one.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.356
Yeah, um...

37:22.440 --> 37:24.396
What's that?

37:24.480 --> 37:26.118
What's what?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.872
That number there.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.632
That's the price.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.716
Adam. I've just been doing some sums.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.439
And?
- And I think we're in really big trouble.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.476
I think we've got to scale down a bit.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.516
Thank you, God.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.149
Yeah. I've been looking at the budget
and our figures just don't add up.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.196
So we can lose the string quartet?

37:45.280 --> 37:49.319
Yeah. And the video-photographer,
and the bridesmaids' dresses and the cake.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.153
And you know what, it still doesn't add up.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.800
Oh, my God, what the bloody shite is that?

37:54.880 --> 37:56.836
What?
- That thing on your finger.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.956
It's my ring.
- No, no, no!

37:59.040 --> 38:00.917
This is your ring!

38:01.000 --> 38:04.151
We all looked over the house for it!
- She left it on the toilet cistern!

38:04.240 --> 38:06.117
Her engagement ring, for crying out loud!

38:06.200 --> 38:08.316
Why weren't you wearing the frigging thing?

38:08.400 --> 38:11.437
I don't know. Because my arm was tired
from lugging it around!

38:11.520 --> 38:14.353
You told me you loved it!
- Well, I don't. I hate it.

38:14.440 --> 38:18.274
Look at it! Only you could spend so much
money on something so cheap!

38:18.360 --> 38:21.716
Can I say something?
- Why spend so much? We can't afford it.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.872
Oh, yes, you know what the reason
for that is, don't you?

38:24.960 --> 38:28.999
You have invited the bloody phone book
to this ridiculous, pretentious wedding!

38:29.080 --> 38:32.789
Pretentious? You bloody cheapskate!
- Huh? Me? A cheapskate?

38:32.880 --> 38:35.872
Got it. Don't get married.
- What?

38:35.960 --> 38:37.916
Well, call off the sodding wedding.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.471
Do it now, before you lose your catering deposit.
It's obviously a rotten, stinking idea anyway.

38:42.560 --> 38:45.393
All you do is slag each other off.
So what's the bloody point?

38:45.480 --> 38:46.754
Jenny?

38:46.840 --> 38:48.796
I don't know why I'm helping you anyway.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.952
Of all the people to ask,
you asked the sodding divorcee!

38:52.040 --> 38:53.439
You're getting divorced?

38:53.520 --> 38:57.274
Pete's idea. Ironic, innit? Yeah.
Apparently, he wants to move on.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.830
And you know Robert, your great mate,
who you made to feel so very welcome,

39:00.920 --> 39:02.433
he's buggered off an'all.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.839
You've finished with Robert?

39:03.920 --> 39:07.356
No. Robert's finished with me.
Apparently he ''needs his space''.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.352
Nice, innit?
You can lob him off your bloody table plan.

39:10.440 --> 39:14.069
Jenny, why didn't you tell us?
- Because you weren't listening, that's why.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.116
Shit, what's the point? I mean...

39:16.200 --> 39:20.079
Sort out your own stupid wedding.
You can have it on Mars for all I care.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.116
Jenny, don't go.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.197
Hi, Karen.
How long would it take you to get ready?

39:27.280 --> 39:29.236
What for?
- For dinner.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.912
What do you think?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.470
David, you know I can't go out for dinner.
I've got to bath the twins.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.836
No, I'm going to bath the kids.
Put them to bed. Everything.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.672
What is going on?

39:39.760 --> 39:43.116
Nothing sinister.
Ramona has offered to baby-sit tonight.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.151
Yeah, well, I didn't exactly want to.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.913
But you know David, he bribe me.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.117
''Bribed'', Ramona, past tense.
You've already got your money.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.749
Now, here, take this. The bath is run,
the cab will be here in half an hour.

39:55.840 --> 39:59.037
The cab?
- Yeah, so we can get absolutely blasted.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.076
Off you go.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.636
Hello again.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.075
We want to know what your returns policy is?

40:10.160 --> 40:12.355
You want to return an engagement ring?

40:12.440 --> 40:14.396
Well, two actually.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.519
Nice surprise.
What do you want, a cup of sugar?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.318
No. Just passing.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.356
Not really on your way home, Pete.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.396
I got lost.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.636
Can I come in?
- Yeah, sorry.

40:33.720 --> 40:37.952
If it's about the D word, I've got
an appointment with a solicitor next week.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.953
Thursday, something like that.
- Let's not talk about that tonight, eh, love?

40:43.040 --> 40:44.598
You've heard, then?

40:45.680 --> 40:48.194
Come to gloat, have you? I don't blame you.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.033
I mean, I can see there's
a certain sort of poetic justice.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.076
No, look, don't be daft.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.116
I've come here to see how you are.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.919
So, how are you?

40:58.000 --> 40:59.752
I'm all right.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.839
Shit, actually, Pete. I'm not
really all right.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.469
I'm...sort of really, really awful,
actually.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.436
Everything's gone wrong, Pete.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.080
Everything's gone wrong. I don't
know what...

41:15.160 --> 41:17.116
I don't know what I'm going to do.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.156
I'm sorry.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.797
I thought this year we should have
a holiday.

41:34.280 --> 41:38.910
A proper one, you know, for three weeks
or a month. Hang the expense.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.833
Somewhere with full childcare facilities.

41:41.920 --> 41:44.354
David?
- Where you can really put your feet up.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.396
Somewhere extremely hot.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.118
What have you been up to?

41:48.200 --> 41:49.792
I'm sorry?

41:50.880 --> 41:53.110
Over the years, I've just happened to notice

41:53.200 --> 41:56.670
that your charm offensives
usually coincide with you feeling guilty,

41:56.760 --> 41:58.796
so, come on, tell me what you've done.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.070
Nothing. Really.
- Nothing?

42:02.160 --> 42:03.388
Really?

42:05.880 --> 42:08.075
Really. Nothing.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.236
All right, there is something.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.836
I have a confession.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.796
I've been guilty...

42:25.880 --> 42:27.836
of taking you for granted.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.116
Yesterday, you were right.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.430
Yes, I just always expect you to be there,

42:34.520 --> 42:37.876
because the idea of you not being there
is just unthinkable.

42:37.960 --> 42:42.397
And I just wanted to show you
in my usual, inept way that I'm...

42:44.080 --> 42:46.275
..you know, very content.

42:47.560 --> 42:50.677
No, not just content, I'm...happy.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.716
Happy...

42:52.800 --> 42:55.075
and proud to be your husband.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.072
An expensive meal is not going to
do it, though, is it, David?

43:02.160 --> 43:03.991
Yeah, I know.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.036
We've had expensive meals before.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.076
Yeah, I know.

43:11.160 --> 43:15.312
But I would do anything, absolutely anything
to make our marriage work again!

43:17.880 --> 43:20.838
I know I don't deserve you.
I know that. And I'm sorry.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.512
I'm sorry.

43:28.600 --> 43:31.239
There's something else
I wanted to talk to you about.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.799
What?

43:32.880 --> 43:36.316
Don't worry. It's nothing sinister.
It's about Adam and Rachel.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.836
What do you think?

43:41.920 --> 43:45.151
I think...it's absolutely beautiful.

43:45.240 --> 43:47.196
Well,

43:47.280 --> 43:49.350
that's what you said about the last one.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.908
Believe me, it is a lot nicer
than the last one.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.596
Sorry about all that.

43:58.080 --> 44:01.197
It all got a bit...fraught, didn't it?

44:02.240 --> 44:04.196
That's all right.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.431
We'll just do the wedding a bit differently,
that's all.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.988
You don't mind about all those
lost deposits?

44:10.080 --> 44:12.036
Ah, it's only money.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.078
Anyway, how could I possibly
be upset about anything

44:16.160 --> 44:21.029
when I'm about to be married to the
best, most beautiful woman in the world?

44:22.120 --> 44:24.076
That's a nice thing to say.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.116
Yes, I thought so.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.156
Who's that?

44:30.480 --> 44:33.438
If it's the bailiffs, don't let them
take the telly.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.670
Do you know, I've been thinking, right.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.593
Why don't we go for
one of those amicable divorces,

44:38.680 --> 44:42.309
where we split up but you still
remain friends. Do you fancy that?

44:42.400 --> 44:44.550
Smashing idea.

44:44.640 --> 44:49.714
Me and my second wife
could go on a caravanning holiday

44:49.800 --> 44:52.792
with you and your second husband.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.314
Right, what bloody second husband?

44:55.400 --> 44:57.675
Oh, come on, don't be daft.

44:57.760 --> 44:59.432
You're bound to get another bloke.

44:59.520 --> 45:01.192
Top bird like you.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.360
That's if your body holds up.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.352
Oh, Pete, you little charmer.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.795
Hi, Adam.
- Oh. Hi. Sorry.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.116
Karen has told me all about
your financial embarrassment,

45:18.200 --> 45:23.194
and it occurred to me that we might be able
to help you out of your difficulty, so to speak.

45:23.280 --> 45:25.748
Part-time cleaning work?

45:25.840 --> 45:30.630
No, we were just wondering if you'd like
to have the wedding reception at our house.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.278
Really?

45:33.560 --> 45:36.996
God, that would be amazing.
- That's a lot of hassle.

45:37.080 --> 45:41.153
Are you sure you don't mind?
- Of course not. It would be an honour.

45:41.240 --> 45:46.075
It was David's idea. Underneath that harsh
exterior, he's actually quite sentimental.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.037
Well, you know.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.076
Think of it as a wedding present.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.515
Though we have actually
bought you a present as well.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.556
David, I don't know what to say.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.755
Well, that's what friends are for.

46:01.840 --> 46:04.912
I don't think I want another fella anyway.
- You will.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.471
No, I'm off the whole romance rubbish.
I just want somebody there for breakfast.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.393
A bit of company, a bit of sex
every now and then, you know.

46:13.720 --> 46:15.870
Not a lot to ask for, is it?

46:18.080 --> 46:19.672
I'd better be off.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.875
Do you have to?

46:22.280 --> 46:24.236
I'm afraid so.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.276
Why don't you stay the night, eh?

46:26.360 --> 46:31.229
Obviously, stay the night in the spare room,
not in our...not in my room.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.151
Obviously.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.389
I can't, Jen.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.713
OK.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.677
I'm meeting Emma.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.716
Fair enough.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.510
Our timing's right up the spout, innit?

46:48.120 --> 46:49.872
Maybe, yeah. Listen, um...

46:49.960 --> 46:53.589
Better not keep her waiting. You'd better
go. She might give you detention!

46:55.200 --> 46:57.156
No, no, eh, don't get up.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.356
I'll...I'll see myself out.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.636
See you.
- Yeah, see you.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.676
Bye.
