Hey, old man, buy me some
Herbie Hancock tickets.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.539
You don't know nothing
about Herbie Hancock.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.743
What?! Don't you tell me I don't

now to go make your beds.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.003
You get two more times,

01:11.005 --> 01:13.772
then a final warning,
and then I go to work angry.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.775
I already made my bed,
Miss Donna.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.777
Is that sarcasm, Junior?

01:18.779 --> 01:22.448
Because if there's one thing I
do not understand, it's sarcasm.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.383
No, I'm telling the truth.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.217
Oh.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.418
Well, then, thank you.

I'm proud of you, son.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.766
Now maybe you could work
on eating a little slower.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.901
And not as much.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.536
And not so often.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.672
And maybe you
could exercise.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.941
Maybe you
could get a job.

01:48.943 --> 01:49.942
(laughing)

01:49.944 --> 01:50.909
Oh-ho-ho!

01:50.911 --> 01:51.877
You know
I been looking.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.613
I just haven't found
the right one yet.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.747
Last week I answered an ad

01:55.749 --> 01:59.017
for an old, grizzled cop
two days from retirement.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.152
(gunfire)

02:00.154 --> 02:02.354
Okay, Brown, go
draw their fire.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.623
But I'm two days

02:04.625 --> 02:06.558

02:08.929 --> 02:12.664
Oh, well, I'm two days

Whoa, watch out
for this guy, huh?

03:24.171 --> 03:27.039
Cleveland, wh-wh-wh-what's
up with the...

03:27.041 --> 03:28.340
with the short
fuse, man?

03:28.342 --> 03:31.043
Aw, I'm just having trouble
finding gainful employment.

03:31.045 --> 03:34.446
Oh, yeah, finding
a job is hard.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.847
I've never
found one.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.050
Yeah I-I-I had
to ask Jesus

03:38.052 --> 03:39.785
to lead me to the
job of my dreams,

03:39.787 --> 03:42.521
and when he did, I knew
that he was the guy

03:42.523 --> 03:44.957
that I wanted to keep going to,
to ask for things.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.392
Last year, I asked Jesus
for tickets to the ESPYs.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.629
He didn't come through, so I
just watched it on my plasma.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.930
Oh, in your
mom's basement?
Shut up!

03:51.932 --> 03:54.900
You know, uh, Cleveland,
there's, uh, an opening

03:54.902 --> 03:57.135
in my department down
at the cable company.

03:57.137 --> 04:00.405
I-I-I could put in
a good word for you.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.373
Telemarketing?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.541
Yes! Yeah-- why-- you--

04:02.543 --> 04:03.875
why does everyone always
say it like that?

04:03.877 --> 04:08.347
Telemarketing is the chatter
of the global marketplace.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.481
Ring, ring.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.082
Hello?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.617
Cleveland, it's
your future.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.620
Are you going to answer it,
or quietly whisper to me,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.355
(whispering):
"Tell them I'm not here."

04:16.357 --> 04:19.024
Plus, for every new
employee I bring in,

04:19.026 --> 04:21.526
I get a $200 bonus.

04:21.528 --> 04:22.794
And I sure could use it

04:22.796 --> 04:27.666
after I donated all that money
to help fight bear AIDS.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.502
(bear roaring)

04:30.504 --> 04:30.969
(gasping)

04:30.971 --> 04:34.339
Did you get the bear
to wear the condom?

04:39.946 --> 04:42.881
Oh, cool! Cubicles!

04:42.883 --> 04:45.017
Good morning,
Mr. Waterman.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.552
Everything okay
here, Tim?

04:47.554 --> 04:48.120
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.456
Say "pineapple" if you
want me to get security.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.191
Oh, no, no, no,
Mr. Waterman,

04:53.193 --> 04:56.461
this is Cleveland, the guy
I was telling you about.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.829
You didn't tell me
he was...

04:57.831 --> 04:59.965
(clearing throat)

04:59.967 --> 05:05.537
(continues
clearing throat)

05:06.572 --> 05:09.675
Okay, here's your desk
and your phone.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.444
Uh, the keypad has
several buttons with numbers

05:12.446 --> 05:13.512
and other things on them.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.113
You-you-you'll probably
just use the ones

05:15.115 --> 05:16.882
with the numbers though,
I would think.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.619
Okay, so I've got you down
for one deluxe package

05:20.621 --> 05:22.020
with high-speed Internet.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.022
No-- thank <i>you, </i> sir.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.090
I just made my first sale!

05:25.092 --> 05:27.359
TIM:
<i>Holy smokes, I've never seen</i>

05:27.361 --> 05:29.494
<i>beginner's luck</i>
<i>like that before.</i>

05:29.496 --> 05:31.096
Okay, bye now.

05:31.098 --> 05:35.067
Hey, my phone is filled
with silver dollars!

05:36.736 --> 05:38.537
Bees!

05:38.539 --> 05:40.505
(screaming)

05:40.507 --> 05:42.574
No!

05:44.677 --> 05:46.878
(Cleveland grunting)

05:46.880 --> 05:49.081
All right.

05:50.883 --> 05:51.650
No!

05:51.652 --> 05:52.751
Great job, Cleveland.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.020
Sorry for judging you
earlier today.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.656
I did what I grew up
watching my mother do:

05:57.658 --> 05:59.257
underestimate minorities.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.726
Course, then she'd
sleep with them.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.929
She sounds like
someone I would dislike,

06:03.931 --> 06:08.367
and then like a lot,
and then dislike again.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.836
(both laughing)

06:12.505 --> 06:13.839
(sighs)

06:15.408 --> 06:20.245
So, no two months gets the
same exotic coffee, right?

06:20.247 --> 06:21.880
Portugal?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.949
Do they know coffee in Portugal?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.884
That sounds expensive.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.252
We have Folgers
Crystals.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.855
You have
Folgers Crystals.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.190
Yes, you have
my card on file.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.992
Thank you.

06:35.762 --> 06:36.728
(sighs)

06:36.730 --> 06:40.165
Uh, I'm-I'm-I'm gonna go
and, uh, take out the trash.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.000
Okay, but when you get back,

06:42.002 --> 06:44.870
you're gonna crawl down
under these sheets

06:44.872 --> 06:46.972
and take care of Mama Bear.

06:48.341 --> 06:51.643
ANNOUNCER:
You're watching <i>Ike Turner</i>

06:51.645 --> 06:54.813

and see me sometime?

06:54.815 --> 06:57.015
What the hell
did you just say?

06:57.017 --> 06:58.316
I didn't say
nothin', Ike.

06:58.318 --> 07:02.254
Why you-- make-- me--
treat-- you-- like-- this?

07:02.256 --> 07:03.121
Huh? Huh?

07:03.123 --> 07:07.559
Roberta, Rallo-- Cleveland Jr.
folded the laundry,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.995
and I think you two
should put it away.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.229
Put away my laundry?!

07:11.231 --> 07:13.598
It's not my job
to pick up after myself.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
I'm not my mother.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.736
You'll get this back

07:17.738 --> 07:19.805
when you're done
with the laundry.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.040
Aw, man.
Now what am I supposed to...

07:22.042 --> 07:24.776
Oh, there's a book.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.712
Don't laugh, America.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.080
Don't laugh.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.650
Can I have
your attention, please?

07:31.652 --> 07:35.086

Neat!

07:45.232 --> 07:47.065
Hey, Tim, you want
to come out with me tonight

07:47.067 --> 07:50.101

through all this extra money?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.336
(sighs)
No, no, no, thanks.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.771
You-you-you go on ahead.

07:52.773 --> 07:56.675
I'm going to stay late and try
to make a few more sales.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.275
Okay.

Well... Yeah, well,
I didn't use any today,

08:34.882 --> 08:37.782
so I figured what I didn't use
I could take home.

No.
That's not how this works.

she puts these in her diet sodas

08:43.190 --> 08:45.790
because she likes so much
chemicals, you know?

08:45.792 --> 08:47.759

the coffee filters for?

08:47.761 --> 08:48.560

nobody stopped Robert Redford.

09:25.766 --> 09:26.798
Let me get this straight.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.969
For only $10,000, I can have
every inch of my skin replaced

09:30.971 --> 09:32.337
with fried chicken?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.405
That's correct.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.640
I'd be a fool not to.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.512
Oh, no way!

09:40.514 --> 09:43.248
Terry Kimple's in
the house, y'all!

09:43.250 --> 09:45.216
Hey, Cleveland!
Holy smokes!

09:45.218 --> 09:46.318
What are you doing here?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.786
Just trying to be
as cool as you.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.789
Well, you're going
to need some tighter pants.

09:50.791 --> 09:51.756
(laughing)

09:51.758 --> 09:55.293
Hey, Tim. Terry here was
my best friend in high school.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.761
He even saved my life once.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.697
Ah, I just did a solid
for a friend.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.799
You'd have done
the same thing.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.703
Hey, man, I needed this.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.804
Thank you.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.939
No problemo.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.275
Hey, what are
you kids doing?

10:11.043 --> 10:12.210
(giggling, snickering)

10:12.212 --> 10:13.845
Shh! Shh! Shh!

10:13.847 --> 10:15.847
I assume this is yours?

10:15.849 --> 10:18.416
Aw, that is racist.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.918
Come on, wise guy.
Let's go.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.019
Now, hang on, chief.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.788
Cleveland didn't know
nothing about this.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.856
That there weed--

10:24.858 --> 10:26.124
well, it belongs to me.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.326
Terry, you could
get expelled.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.260
That's all right, man.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.930
Your future's a hell of a lot
brighter than mine is.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.999
Heck, you could be
the first black president

10:34.001 --> 10:35.033
of the United States.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.969
You take this opportunity
and you use it, Cleveland.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.771
Let's go.
(groans)

10:39.773 --> 10:42.107
You use it!
Use it, man!

10:42.109 --> 10:43.842
You use it!

10:43.844 --> 10:45.510
So, how did
your life turn out?

10:45.512 --> 10:49.147
Well, when my adulterous ex-wife
took my house in our divorce,

10:49.149 --> 10:52.117
I moved back to town
and hastily married a woman

10:52.119 --> 10:55.286
I had not seen nor spoken to
in over 20 years.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.857
So, in addition to my own
emotionally fragile son,

10:58.859 --> 11:02.227
I'm now responsible for two
ill-mannered stepchildren,

11:02.229 --> 11:05.897
which is why I got
an entry-level telemarketing job

11:05.899 --> 11:07.365
at the cable company.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.867
So, pretty good, I guess.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.435
What?!
Oh, sorry, man. Sorry.

11:10.437 --> 11:14.139
I was just checking out
that pair of legs down there.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.140
(laughing)

11:15.142 --> 11:16.808
I see Terry Kimple
hasn't changed.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.344
Yeah! The ladies
love my cable truck.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.879
It's a hot fur magnet.

11:20.881 --> 11:21.846
Hey, you know what?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.382
You should come out
with me on my calls today.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.483
We could catch up.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.920
<i>Lord Jesus, could you please</i>
<i>encourage Cleveland</i>

11:28.922 --> 11:31.756
<i>to go with Terry</i>
<i>in his hot fur magnet,</i>

11:31.758 --> 11:33.124
<i>so I can catch up to his sales?</i>

11:33.126 --> 11:35.560
Hey, Tim, will you
be all right if I leave you?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.863
Oh, yeah! Yeah.
Have a good time.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.198
<i>Thanks, Jesus.</i>

11:40.200 --> 11:41.900
<i>Okay, now, maybe we can talk</i>

11:41.902 --> 11:45.537
<i>about bringing back</i>
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</i>

11:45.539 --> 11:48.339
(tuba blurts a note)

11:48.341 --> 11:50.208
(plays)

11:50.210 --> 11:52.444
(door creaking)

11:57.483 --> 11:58.850
Hey, Cleveland Jr.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.418
My day's going well.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.453
How 'bout "chores"?

12:01.455 --> 12:03.922
That's a funny way
to say it.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.190
But it's going all right.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.357
Don't be smart.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.325
You listen to me, Jack.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.160
You better stop
cleaning up around here

12:09.162 --> 12:11.863
or things are going
to get messy.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.398
Like this!

12:13.400 --> 12:13.998
No!

12:14.000 --> 12:16.367
Tuck in the corners,
just like Mommy did it.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.470
Just like things were
when Mommy did it.

12:18.472 --> 12:20.105
And don't divorce the sheets.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.474
The sheets
must never be divorced.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.077
(bleep), dude.

12:27.713 --> 12:30.448
So, I said "I don't care
if you're pregnant.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.984
That's a three-way
in my book."

12:32.986 --> 12:35.153
(guffawing)

12:35.155 --> 12:37.889
This is humorous.
Why aren't you laughing, Tim?

12:37.891 --> 12:38.523
Yeah, what is this?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.258
Is your wife
having her bear period?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.359
(guffawing)

12:41.361 --> 12:42.861
CLEVELAND:
Oh, gross.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.028
Why would you say that?

12:44.030 --> 12:45.230
Let me get the next round.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.133
I'm still playing
with that sweet bonus.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.467
Uh, actually, uh, Cleveland,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.970
do you think I could use
the five dollars

12:51.972 --> 12:54.005
you would spend on that beer,

12:54.007 --> 12:56.374
maybe for a sandwich for me?

12:56.376 --> 12:57.008
Seriously?

12:57.010 --> 12:59.144
What, am I buying
rounds of food now?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.345
(laughing)

13:00.347 --> 13:01.613
Hey, I'll tell you what, Tim.

13:01.615 --> 13:05.150
You show us your bear penis
and I'll buy you a whole steak.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.085
(laughing)

13:07.087 --> 13:08.119
Oh...

13:08.121 --> 13:09.053
Hey, Yogi.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.590
(imitating Yogi Bear):
Is it bigger than
the average bear's?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.159
(laughing)

13:14.161 --> 13:15.660
CLEVELAND:
He has a bear penis.

13:15.662 --> 13:19.264
TIM:
<i>Go ahead and laugh at the</i>
<i>financially struggling bear.</i>

13:19.266 --> 13:20.365
<i>I hope...</i>

13:20.367 --> 13:24.068
<i>I hope Jesus makes</i>
<i>something bad happen to you.</i>

13:24.070 --> 13:26.070
<i>(gasps)</i>
<i>There. I said it.</i>

13:26.072 --> 13:30.241
So, were you serious about
the "penis for steak" deal?

13:33.979 --> 13:36.080
You okay to drive?
You're a little drunk.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.517
Yeah, well, thanks to my mama,
I was born a little drunk.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.085
(Cleveland laughing)

13:41.087 --> 13:43.221
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh... Uh-oh.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.389
Oh, no.
This is bad, man.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.490
This will be my third DUI.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.792
I'm going to go to jail.
I'm going to lose my job.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.562
They're going to
make me cut my hair!

13:50.564 --> 13:53.464
(harp glissando)

13:53.466 --> 13:56.034
That there weed?
Well, it belongs to me.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.969
I just did a solid
for a friend.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.571
You'd have done
the same thing.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.006
(Cleveland and Terry
guffawing)

14:02.008 --> 14:04.042
ET's finger!

14:04.044 --> 14:05.043
Phone home!

14:05.045 --> 14:07.178
(laughing)
(laughing)

14:07.180 --> 14:11.216
You go on and get out of here.
I was driving this truck.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.217
(siren wailing)

14:12.219 --> 14:14.586
You're a good
friend, man.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.054
Thanks.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.556
(siren wails, stops)

14:19.425 --> 14:21.192
Check him for drugs.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.094
Oh, that's racist.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.295
No, this is racist:

14:24.297 --> 14:26.631
Asian people are
horrible drivers.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.432
Ooh-hoo!

14:27.434 --> 14:28.867
Now, get in the car.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.734
Aw...

14:29.736 --> 14:32.370
Aw... so.
(laughter)

14:36.275 --> 14:38.309
Thanks for bailing me
out, sweetheart.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.145
Baby, I'm a ride-or-die
bitch, you know that.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.480
You're a good man,
Cleveland Brown,

14:42.482 --> 14:46.751
covering for your friend,
and I'm proud to be your wife.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.253
But we're in trouble, Donna.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.188
I'll probably
get fired for this.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.290
(gasps)
And what if you go to jail?

14:52.292 --> 14:55.693
The thought of my man in prison
lifting rusty weights all day,

14:55.695 --> 14:58.997
getting hard, fighting
for his life in the shower,

14:58.999 --> 15:01.299
all soaped up and shiny?

15:01.301 --> 15:02.133
Mmm...

15:02.135 --> 15:06.671
Mm-hmm, beating down a man
for fronting me in the yard.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.605
Oh, yeah!

15:07.607 --> 15:10.108
I mean, who the hell does
he think he is, anyway?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.611
What makes him think
I won't cut him?
Oh, Cleveland!

15:13.613 --> 15:14.679
(tires screech)

15:14.681 --> 15:17.982
Okay, flip me over;
I'll be the girl first.

15:17.984 --> 15:18.650
What?!

15:18.652 --> 15:21.653
This is prison
we're talkin' about!

15:24.723 --> 15:26.591
Hey, Junior,
Roberta and I think

15:26.593 --> 15:28.326
you're obsessively
cleaning everything

15:28.328 --> 15:30.428
because you have
some unresolved issues

15:30.430 --> 15:32.330
about your parents' divorce.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.665
I'm totally fine
with the divorce.

15:33.667 --> 15:38.136
As a matter of fact,
I've never even cried about it,

15:38.138 --> 15:39.470
not one tear.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.605
What?!

15:40.607 --> 15:42.040
Why would I cry?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.374
I mean, nobody died.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.743
Just a family, a family died.

15:45.745 --> 15:49.247
That's all it is, a dead family.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.351
That boy's in denial.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.719
He's got to <i>get it out.</i>

15:54.721 --> 15:57.388
You know, it's not
like he doesn't have

15:57.390 --> 15:58.690
plenty of reasons to cry.

15:58.692 --> 16:02.260
Yeah, he's so fat, he'll
probably die in his 40s.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.361
Rallo, that's mean.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.263
What if he heard
you say that?

16:05.265 --> 16:06.798
He'd probably cry.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.467
What's the name of
that Jewish comedian?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.802
Don Rickles?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.037
Get him on the phone.

16:14.606 --> 16:17.275
Oh, man! Has Waterman
talked to you yet?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.677
Not yet. I hope
he doesn't fire me.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.579
I should be the one
getting fired!

16:21.581 --> 16:25.116
Fired by Jesus Christ,
our Lord and Savior.

16:25.118 --> 16:25.783
Eh, big deal!

16:25.785 --> 16:27.352
You showed
your penis for food.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.553
We all been there.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.723
No, I was so jealous
of Cleveland's success that...

16:31.725 --> 16:36.761
I prayed to Jesus that something
bad would happen to him.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.830
I'm so sorry, Cleveland.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.498
Tim, you are dumb.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.268
Out of pity,
I accept your apology.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.137
(high-pitched):
Bye-bye.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.339
Cleveland, I'm sorry,
but I can't tolerate

16:48.341 --> 16:50.675
the destruction
of company property.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.809
The truck is one thing,

16:51.811 --> 16:53.378
but if anything had
happened to Terry,

16:53.380 --> 16:55.747
well, I... I don't know
what I would've...

16:55.749 --> 16:57.248
this company would have done.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.717
He's a good worker, a good man,

16:59.719 --> 17:01.786
a strong...
(trembling breath)

17:01.788 --> 17:04.822
robust, tastefully cologned man.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.225
O-kay.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.675
(lisping):
Here's your tea,
Mr. Waterman.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.711
(dramatic music plays)

17:26.713 --> 17:28.212
Oh...

17:28.214 --> 17:32.383
The point is, Cleveland,
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to let you go.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.451
Oh, that's too bad.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.386
I sure am gonna
miss Terry.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.388
He and I go a
long way back.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.323
We were on the swim
team together.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.793
Did he wear a Speedo?
Yes, he wore
a Speedo.

17:41.795 --> 17:46.764
That is, when you
could get him to put
<i>on</i>  bathing suit.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.569
Hey, Junior,
get in here for a minute.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.537
What's going on?

17:52.539 --> 17:55.506
We decided it's high
time you cried--

17:55.508 --> 17:58.609
but we got to ease
you into it.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.679
(band playing lively music)

18:02.748 --> 18:03.648
"Good evening,

18:03.650 --> 18:06.451
"and welcome to the roast
of Cleveland Brown Jr.,

18:06.453 --> 18:10.655
a man so huge,
his butt has its own zip code."

18:10.657 --> 18:13.491
(remote clicks,
recorded laughter plays)

18:13.493 --> 18:14.592
(laughing)

18:14.594 --> 18:15.426
Are you saying

18:15.428 --> 18:17.929
I'm as large as a municipality?

18:17.931 --> 18:18.963
And now, a young lady

18:18.965 --> 18:22.567
who goes to third base
faster than Rickey Henderson,

18:22.569 --> 18:25.169
my sister,
Roberta Tubbs.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.404
(recorded applause)

18:26.406 --> 18:28.272
Rallo Tubbs, everyone.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.308
Or, as he's soon to be known,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.210
"That's him, Officer."

18:32.212 --> 18:34.312
(spits, laughs)

18:34.314 --> 18:36.247
And Cleveland Brown Jr.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.748
Or, as you're soon to be known,

18:37.750 --> 18:41.652
"The poor bastard
they buried in a piano case."

18:41.654 --> 18:44.589
(canned laughter, applause)

18:44.890 --> 18:49.393
Speaking of Jews, here comes
one in a big, gross diaper...

18:49.395 --> 18:54.031
Don Rickles impersonator
Keith Lieb.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.367
(recorded applause)
Thanks, Rallo.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.270
Hey, look who it is--
a colored Shelly Winters.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.473
That's hurtful even
without knowing the reference.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.343
Hey, Don, let's leave
the "colored" out of it.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.410
All right, all right!

19:06.412 --> 19:08.346
Look at this fat son of a bitch.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.814
You put a hot plate on this kid,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.649
you got yourself
a Manhattan studio apartment.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.486
(recorded laughter,
Cleveland Jr. sobs)

19:15.488 --> 19:18.489
Stop making fun of me!

19:18.491 --> 19:19.524
There it is!

19:19.526 --> 19:22.460
Let out all the pain
from your parents' divorce.

19:22.462 --> 19:26.397
I promise you'll
feel better.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.533
I love you guys.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.433
Thank you.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.903
We love you,
too, Junior.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.572
What, did KFC
go out of business?

19:34.574 --> 19:37.975
I better get out of here
before I get killed.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.444
He's from
a different time.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.681
And that's why we called
him "The Wet Banana."

19:43.683 --> 19:47.451
Oh, I could tell
unnecessarily
graphic stories

19:47.453 --> 19:48.753
about Terry all day,

19:48.755 --> 19:51.556
but I got to go
pack up my desk.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.990
Well, let's not
be too hasty.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.926
It's possible I...
overreacted.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.362
I assume you're sorry.
You're sorry, right?

19:58.364 --> 19:58.796
Very.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.366
And if you stayed,
you could tell me stories.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.602
Say, one every morning over tea?

20:04.604 --> 20:05.903
Stories that, you know,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.972
Mrs. Waterman
wouldn't need to hear.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.674
Stories that
only a man should hear.

20:09.676 --> 20:13.911
Well, <i>if </i> I come back,
I'd like to work with
Terry as an installer.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.614
I don't want to be
chained to a desk.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.583
Plus, Tim's
your salesman.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.116
The bear?

20:19.118 --> 20:21.085
Yeah. You don't want
to lose him.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.321
In fact, you
should give him a raise.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.523
(quietly): Have you
seen his weenie?

20:25.525 --> 20:26.457
- I have.
- Me, too.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.559
- Isn't it magnificent?
- Isn't it weird?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.194
Isn't it weird?

20:32.931 --> 20:34.599
Yes!

20:41.406 --> 20:44.675
Ha! I don't know
how you got out of it,

20:44.677 --> 20:45.543
but you did!

20:45.545 --> 20:46.877
So what's the plan, amigo?

20:46.879 --> 20:49.747
You're getting laid,
I'm getting paid,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.682
and we're doing
it drunk!

20:51.684 --> 20:52.650
All right!
Whoo!

20:52.652 --> 20:55.086
Yee-hah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

20:55.088 --> 20:57.421
Hey, Cleveland,
check it out!

20:57.423 --> 20:59.757
Huh? Oh!
You owe me a steak!

20:59.759 --> 21:02.693
Put that away!
(laughing)
