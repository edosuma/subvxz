00:17.434 --> 00:19.601
ANNOUNCER: A world in crisis!

00:19.686 --> 00:24.523
The peaceful planet of Mandalore is
being strangled by the grip of corruption.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.358
With shortages of every kind,

00:26.443 --> 00:30.029
citizens must turn to the black market
in order to survive.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.822
Desperate to free her people,

00:31.906 --> 00:34.658
Duchess Satine
has asked her friend PadmÃ© Amidala

00:34.743 --> 00:36.702
to speak with the Jedi Council

00:36.786 --> 00:41.165
in hopes that they will send assistance
to her struggling world.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.668
The Jedi Council has
given you a mission, Ahsoka.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.378
It's your duty to see it through.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.007
Don't you think
I'm just a little overqualified for this?

00:50.091 --> 00:54.470
According to Senator Amidala,
Mandalore is a deeply corrupt world.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.013
If the cycle is to be broken,

00:56.097 --> 00:58.182
the future leaders at
the Royal Academy of Government

00:58.266 --> 01:00.684
must learn the evils of corruption.

01:00.769 --> 01:04.313
Yoda feels that only a young Padawan
like you can get through to them.

01:19.621 --> 01:23.457
My lady, if I may,
what do the Jedi know of our ways?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.376
Do we really want them meddling
with our children's education?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.961
Surely there is nothing to fear

01:28.046 --> 01:31.173
from exposing them to new ideas,
Prime Minister.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.052
Duchess Satine.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.012
Prime Minister Almec.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.057
Master Skywalker,
so good to see you again.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.767
This is your Padawan, I assume?

01:41.851 --> 01:45.813
Yes, my lady. May I present Ahsoka Tano.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.065
Duchess. Prime Minister.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.568
I am grateful that the Jedi Council
could spare the two of you

01:51.653 --> 01:55.114
to help instruct our leaders
and peacekeepers of tomorrow.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.116
Please thank Master Yoda for me.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.995
I'm afraid that
due to our limited resources,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.248
I must return to battle immediately.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.000
So you will not be staying,
Master Skywalker?

02:07.085 --> 02:12.089
No, but I assure you,
Padawan Tano is a highly capable Jedi

02:12.173 --> 02:14.049
and has the full confidence of the Council.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.845
Very well. Cadet Korkie, Amis, Lagos.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.932
These are some of the cadets that
you will be instructing, Padawan Tano.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.767
Nice to meet all of you.

02:23.852 --> 02:28.063
-That's a fine weapon. May I see it?
-I'm afraid not.

02:28.148 --> 02:32.109
Because of Master Kenobi's recent visit
and the trouble that followed,

02:32.193 --> 02:35.154
no offworlders may carry weapons
on Mandalore.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.866
Master Obi-Wan caused trouble?
That's a first.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.661
Just give me the lightsaber.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.959
Thank you for respecting our ways,
Master Jedi.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.337
Excuse the interruption, sir,
but it is time to depart.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.423
General Fisto is expecting us.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.592
If you'll excuse me.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.521
Corruption is what happens

03:09.606 --> 03:12.274
when someone in power
puts their own personal gain

03:12.358 --> 03:14.776
before the interests of
the people they represent.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.197
-So, it's a result of greed?
-Yes.

03:18.573 --> 03:23.368
A leader sacrifices moral integrity
for the sake of money or power.

03:23.453 --> 03:27.080
Entire star systems have collapsed
into chaos or revolution

03:27.123 --> 03:29.124
because their greedy politicians
got caught up

03:29.209 --> 03:32.961
in a cycle of bribery and blackmail,
while their people suffered.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.131
Does that mean
most government officials are corrupt?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.467
Well, no.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.470
But the point is
that temptation is always there,

03:41.596 --> 03:45.557
and citizens must be vigilant
so corruption can't take root.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.228
The deadliest enemies of a society
dwell within its borders.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.940
And from these internal threats,
the people need to be protected.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.235
But if you don't trust your leaders,
isn't that treason?

03:56.319 --> 03:58.987
It's every citizen's duty
to challenge their leaders,

03:59.113 --> 04:02.491
to keep them honest and
hold them accountable if they're not.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.951
How do you do that?

04:03.993 --> 04:07.162
By exposing corrupt officials
for what they are.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.165
Lasting change can only come from within.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.924
Be sure your assignments
are prepared for tomorrow.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.343
The school's out of rations again.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.596
I guess there'll be
no late-night snacks tonight.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.141
Listen, we've had a food shortage
since the war began.

04:28.184 --> 04:32.020
Transport ships keep coming in,
but there's strict rationing.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.855
Something is wrong on Mandalore.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.818
But these problems are bigger than us.
Just let the authorities handle it.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.988
We have to do something about it,
like Ahsoka said.

04:41.030 --> 04:45.867
Let's go down to the warehouse district
and see if there really is a food shortage.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.788
Beats sitting around here,
listening to my stomach growl.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.134
These doors are heavily secured
by the government.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.969
It won't be secure for long.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.893
Looks like the Academy taught us well.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.855
Come on, up and over.

05:20.945 --> 05:21.945
(GRUNTS)

05:25.325 --> 05:26.325
(GRUNTS)

05:29.787 --> 05:30.787
(EXCLAIMS)

05:32.206 --> 05:34.875
I have a bad feeling about this.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.919
-What are you doing?
-Quiet!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.422
It sounds like someone else is in here.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.633
-Let's get out of here.
-No! Come on!

05:47.096 --> 05:50.932
The risk involved makes the price go up.

05:53.561 --> 05:57.564
You must be more cautious.
Coming here could raise suspicion.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.109
It's a little late for a meeting, isn't it?
Let's get a closer look.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.320
Are you crazy?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.581
It wasn't my idea.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.168
Soniee, quick, use your holocam.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.508
Those look like Mandalorian police,
but they're unmarked.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.926
Who's that?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.012
And who are those guys?

06:29.138 --> 06:31.348
What are offworlders doing
on a secure port?

06:31.474 --> 06:34.518
I don't like this. I'm getting out of here.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.746
Hurry! This way!

07:10.596 --> 07:11.680
Hey! No!

07:38.499 --> 07:39.958
What are we going to do?

07:40.042 --> 07:43.420
This is bigger than we thought.
We're going to need help.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.760
We should speak to my Aunt Satine.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.191
(DOOR BEEPS)

08:05.610 --> 08:07.694
Aunt Satine, may we speak with you?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.198
Of course, Korkie. Come in.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.870
We did some investigating.

08:16.954 --> 08:21.166
There's no food shortage. We found
stores of food at the government port.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.170
-How would you know this?
-That doesn't matter right now.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.505
I beg to differ.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.382
We made a recording of a secret meeting
between what we know

08:29.467 --> 08:31.843
was a government official
and a black marketeer.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.847
That's why everything costs so much
and so many people are starving.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.350
We need your help
to find the one responsible.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.311
This is a serious matter, I agree.

08:41.395 --> 08:45.565
But the source of this evil may be
more than you cadets can handle.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.400
People can be very deceiving.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.237
You don't want to
get yourselves into trouble.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.156
But, Auntie, don't you see?
You can't ignore this!

08:53.699 --> 08:55.534
I won't, trust me.

08:55.618 --> 08:59.538
But for your own safety,
you must let me take care of it.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.542
Now run along, all of you.
Concentrate on your studies.

09:03.626 --> 09:07.879
There will be a time to save the world
when you're a bit older.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.720
She refused to help us because
she doesn't think we can handle it.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.390
She just thinks
we're a bunch of stupid kids.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.892
She acted like nothing was wrong.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.395
We need to find someone else
who believes us.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.313
Like who?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.315
Mandalore has two people in charge.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.819
Since my aunt won't help,
we'll have to go to the Prime Minister.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.487
What makes you think he'll listen?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.322
I've known him my whole life.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.158
He's always told me to come to him
if I'm ever in trouble.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.036
And I'd say we're all in big trouble.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.541
I am most concerned by these allegations,
my intrepid young cadets.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.877
You think Duchess Satine knows
who the conspirator is?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.713
She said she was going to handle it.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.340
Meet me in the Palace Plaza tonight.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.843
Bring the recording you took
of the black market deal

09:54.885 --> 09:57.846
and all the cadets who know about it.

10:02.893 --> 10:07.480
Korkie, you seem distracted today.
What's going on?

10:07.523 --> 10:10.400
We did what you said.
We found evidence of corruption.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.693
What do you mean?

10:11.777 --> 10:15.614
Well, we were hungry,
so we decided to go look for food.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.032
-Food?
-Yeah.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.867
Down at the government warehouse.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.537
Someone just let you in
to inspect the warehouse?

10:22.580 --> 10:25.957
-No, we broke in.
-Oh, great.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.876
So you committed a crime?

10:27.918 --> 10:32.047
It sounds bad, I know, but then
we saw a meeting and offworlders and...

10:32.089 --> 10:33.256
And they chased us!

10:33.382 --> 10:34.883
Maybe they chased you

10:34.967 --> 10:37.886
because you broke into
a government warehouse.

10:37.928 --> 10:41.222
No! It was a black market deal. I know it!

10:41.265 --> 10:44.809
My Aunt Satine told us to stay out of it,
but we must do something.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.604
-Do you have proof?
-We made a holo-recording.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.565
The Prime Minister
is meeting us tonight to...

10:50.650 --> 10:52.317
Are you sure that's a good idea?

10:52.401 --> 10:57.739
But I thought you said it was the duty of
every citizen to expose corrupt officials.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.117
I'm only saying
that you should take this slowly.

11:01.243 --> 11:06.247
Examine all of the facts and all of
the people involved before you act.

11:07.583 --> 11:11.252
You sound more like my aunt
than a Jedi Knight.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.688
You Korkie?

11:29.772 --> 11:32.273
Prime Minister, is that you?

11:32.358 --> 11:37.320
Secret Service. You are all under arrest
for treason, corruption, and conspiracy.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.572
You will come with us.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.700
These are the same guards
we saw last night.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.247
We've done nothing wrong.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.558
Looks like the Prime Minister set you up.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.477
That's treason.
He's the leader of our system.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.229
He couldn't possibly be a traitor.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.731
We need proof.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.525
We have the recording.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.531
That's no good. You can't see who it is.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.992
Wait! Stop right there.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.539
Information retrieval,
I need you to ID a hologram.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.005
That's him!

12:37.089 --> 12:39.591
You're right! That is the Prime Minister.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.094
We have to take this to my aunt
and warn her.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.096
They know I talked to her.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.228
We're too late.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.566
He's dead.

12:57.109 --> 13:00.570
Korkie, wait!
The intruders may still be inside.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.951
They took her. This is all my fault!

13:17.797 --> 13:19.881
Who knows what they've done to her.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.593
Now what?
How are we supposed to find her?

13:23.677 --> 13:25.303
Who can we trust?

13:25.387 --> 13:28.181
I need all of you to calm down and focus.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.642
We know the Prime Minister is behind this.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.645
After my aunt, he's the most
powerful person on Mandalore.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.022
So, let's go talk to him.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.536
Master Jedi,
this is an unexpected pleasure.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.787
What can I do for you?

13:50.871 --> 13:54.916
Actually, Prime Minister,
it's what I can do for you.

14:01.257 --> 14:05.385
I believe some of my students
are involved in a conspiracy against you.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.387
Intriguing.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.942
You can't do this!
We trusted you, Master Tano.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.114
Thank you for bringing the traitors
to justice, Master Jedi.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.075
They mentioned that
Duchess Satine was their leader.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.535
We should arrest her, too.

14:30.619 --> 14:34.122
Do not worry,
we already have her in custody.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.207
Really? Where?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.084
That is none of your concern.

14:38.127 --> 14:42.797
Now I must prepare a public statement
about the Duchess and her crimes.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.604
Officer, I need to interrogate
the prisoners immediately.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.386
Careful. We're being watched.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.679
Did he buy it?

15:31.722 --> 15:35.141
-Have you found my aunt?
-Not exactly.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.726
But I know they have her in custody.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.812
-Where?
-The Prime Minister wouldn't tell me.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.899
I knew this plan wouldn't work.

15:43.025 --> 15:48.154
Have a little faith. I'll find her.
We'll just modify the plan a bit.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.031
How are you going to do that?

15:50.074 --> 15:53.493
Don't worry. You'll know when to act
when I give the signal.

15:53.535 --> 15:57.163
-What's the signal?
-You'll know it when you see it.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.255
-You will take me to Duchess Satine.
-I will take you to Duchess Satine.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.746
What are you doing?

16:39.289 --> 16:44.919
-I must interrogate the Duchess.
-You must interrogate the Duchess.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.436
I'm getting you out of here.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.354
Ahsoka, it's a trap.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.982
I see you found the Duchess, youngling.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.526
You may stop
your playacting now, Sergeant.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.445
-Prime Minister, sir!
-Prime Minister, sir!

17:13.115 --> 17:16.367
Using a Jedi mind trick
was a very poor decision.

17:16.452 --> 17:20.329
My guards have been trained
to resist such archaic magic.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.542
And now you have revealed yourself
as a conspirator.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.336
Set for stun.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.548
You little fool.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.634
Where is she?

17:33.677 --> 17:35.720
Stick to Ahsoka's plan.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.306
But how do we do that? It's falling apart.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.809
Ahsoka wants us to wait for a signal,
and that's what we're going to do.

17:44.354 --> 17:48.649
Sign it. Sign the confession
and admit to your treasonous ways.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.737
There is only one traitor
to Mandalore here, Prime Minister,

17:52.821 --> 17:57.033
and that's you!
You control the black market.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.993
You have betrayed the public trust,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.913
and used your office
to accumulate wealth and power.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.539
It's shameful.

18:03.707 --> 18:08.795
(CHUCKLING) Your idealism is inspiring,
my dear, but hopelessly naive.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.506
I established the black market
for the people.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.174
That's absurd!

18:13.258 --> 18:16.010
The war is disrupting trade
across the galaxy.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.678
The profits from the black market

18:17.763 --> 18:21.766
are being used to purchase
humanitarian supplies for Mandalore.

18:21.850 --> 18:26.020
Think of it as a new tax
in the interest of national security.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.690
It's a tax for your benefit, Prime Minister.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.777
Where are these "humanitarian supplies"
you speak of?

18:32.861 --> 18:35.696
Sergeant, put the shock collar on her.

18:37.741 --> 18:41.744
My patience has worn thin, Duchess.
Maybe this will convince you.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.123
(GROANING)

18:47.376 --> 18:49.043
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:49.545 --> 18:52.463
I would rather die
than sign your confession.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.549
That can be arranged.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.926
You're wasting your time!

18:57.052 --> 19:00.721
Bring me those traitorous cadets.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.642
No, you can't! They're just children!

19:10.899 --> 19:12.400
All right, let's move.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.410
I'm afraid your nephew
will have to suffer needlessly.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.288
Put the shock collar on Cadet Korkie.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.426
Go!

20:05.495 --> 20:06.495
(EXCLAIMS)

20:07.956 --> 20:09.207
Gotcha!

20:09.499 --> 20:11.626
(SCREAMING)

20:12.669 --> 20:14.462
Stop fighting!

20:15.422 --> 20:17.465
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

20:20.636 --> 20:22.970
Send for my personal guards.

20:39.363 --> 20:43.324
You must know by now
that I didn't bring you here just to teach.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.827
I knew something was amiss,
but I had no one to trust.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.829
I thought if I brought a Jedi,

20:48.914 --> 20:53.542
especially a friend of Senator Amidala's,
we could solve this mystery together.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.544
I never doubted you, Duchess.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.338
Neither did we.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.478
It was an honor
to serve with a Jedi Knight.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.606
It was my privilege to be your teacher.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.739
I hope this assignment
wasn't too boring for you.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.825
It had its moments.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.620
Like the one
where you convinced untrained children

21:29.705 --> 21:32.456
to help you overthrow
a corrupt government?

21:32.541 --> 21:34.625
That was a highlight.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.254
It sounds pretty risky.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.715
Nothing you wouldn't have done.

22:32.726 --> 22:33.726
