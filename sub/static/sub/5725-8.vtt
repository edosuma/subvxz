WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:06.074
(phone buzzing)

00:07.841 --> 00:09.243
(laughs)

00:09.277 --> 00:10.444
Agent Rupert Flemming!

00:10.478 --> 00:12.346
How are things
across the pond? I--

00:12.380 --> 00:14.182
No! God no! No!

00:14.215 --> 00:15.316
Please!
Rupert?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.185
Please no! No! No!
Rupert...

00:17.218 --> 00:18.286
Rupert?

00:18.319 --> 00:21.021
(screaming)
(mechanical drilling)

00:22.623 --> 00:25.659
Rupert? Rupert?

00:25.693 --> 00:28.729
I'm sorry, Agent Flemming can't
come to the phone right now.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.165
(drilling)
(screaming)

00:31.199 --> 00:32.733
Who is this?!
What the hell's going on?!

00:32.766 --> 00:34.835
(screaming)

00:34.868 --> 00:38.206
Rupert?!

00:38.239 --> 00:39.840
Who is this?
He's a little busy dying,

00:39.873 --> 00:41.209
Agent Ryan.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.077
But I have a message for you.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.745
Stop chasing me or more agents

00:44.778 --> 00:46.080
will follow
your dear friend Rupert

00:46.114 --> 00:48.349
into the afterlife.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.618
No!
(screaming)

00:50.651 --> 00:51.485
No!

00:51.519 --> 00:54.188
No! No--

00:56.657 --> 00:59.627
Get me Miguel Vega, Interpol.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.597
(speaking Spanish)

01:04.865 --> 01:07.135
(phone buzzing)

01:09.403 --> 01:11.105
(quiet laugh)

01:11.139 --> 01:13.574
Avery, it seems
congratulations are in order.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.509
I've heard you've been promoted.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.279
Barcelona, why?

01:21.482 --> 01:23.484
Rupert?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.421
I'm on the next flight.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.136
(indistinct radio transmission)

01:45.573 --> 01:47.541
Demolition power drill.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.278
21-inch bit, 1,500 RPMs.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.679
Cuts through
pretty much anything--

01:51.712 --> 01:53.681
metal, concrete,

01:53.714 --> 01:55.683
flesh and bone.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.685
Grisly torture,
violent execution.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.587
This was Python.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.556
Yeah, I thought hackers stayed
behind their computer.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.425
Python's different--
he's one of the most violent

02:04.458 --> 02:06.360
cyber drug dealer
we've ever encountered.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.828
He's got no problem
hopping into the real world

02:07.861 --> 02:11.332
to kill whoever
stands in his way.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.202
But an Interpol agent--
that's kind of risky, isn't it?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.536
Rupert must've
stumbled upon something

02:15.569 --> 02:17.605
Python really
didn't want getting out.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.573
Something worth
killing an agent to protect.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.876
Miguel, what was
Rupert even doing here?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.713
He was meeting
an informant.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.182
I didn't know it
was about Python.

02:28.216 --> 02:31.485
Rupert swore he was gonna be
the agent that took him down.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.587
You actually spoke to Python?

02:33.621 --> 02:36.324
You heard the bastard's voice
on the phone?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.825
Yeah.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.728
When my phone rang,
I thought it was Rupert.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.196
(Flemming screaming)

02:42.230 --> 02:43.564
PYTHON:
Stop chasing me!

02:43.597 --> 02:45.466
(gunshot)

02:45.499 --> 02:48.202
I haven't told
his wife Diana yet.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.670
I have...

02:49.703 --> 02:52.240
no idea what to say.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.307
Call her, Miguel.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.975
Better she hear it from you.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.478
Not... the news

02:57.511 --> 02:59.813
or some stranger
in the Bureau.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.216
Yeah.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.720
You know, a year ago,
Rupert saved my life.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.459
And I'm ashamed I couldn't
do the same for him.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.729
There's no way you could've.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.800
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call her.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.771
Serial number's filed off.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.340
MUNDO:
That's Python's M.O.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.409
Removes the serial number
from any gun he uses.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.278
And leaves it
at the scene of the crime.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.380
It's how he
gets away every time.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.283
So if he's done this before,
you must have those other guns?

03:35.316 --> 03:37.385
Yep, six.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.586
One from each of Python's
previous murders.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.788
All in an FBI evidence locker.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.490
All the serial numbers
filed off.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.358
Yeah, I'd like to take
a look at those.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.560
Can we make that happen?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.028
RAMIREZ:
Rupert Flemming
was meeting with someone,

03:48.061 --> 03:49.530
so I had Interpol

03:49.563 --> 03:50.564
send an image of his laptop.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.366
I've been through it twice

03:52.400 --> 03:53.534
trying to find communication

03:53.567 --> 03:54.935
with an anonymous
New York informant.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.437
I found nothing.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.671
And just like
Rupert's cell phone,

03:57.705 --> 03:59.773
no sign of intrusion.

03:59.807 --> 04:00.874
Well, if Python didn't
hack Rupert's devices,

04:00.908 --> 04:01.975
how'd he know he was
in New York?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.478
Python's skills
are legendary.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.414
Is it possible
he hacked Interpol?

04:06.447 --> 04:07.515
That's what I was thinking.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.616
So I had Interpol send a scan

04:08.649 --> 04:09.650
of their network.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.951
They looked for artifacts

04:10.984 --> 04:12.586
of known vulnerabilities,
found nothing,

04:12.620 --> 04:15.489
and then they analyzed
all the employee devices,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.658
and still didn't find
a single intrusion.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.694
I have no idea how Python
knew about Rupert's meeting.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.895
Found out somehow.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.832
We figure that out, maybe we
can use that to track him down.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.066
What would D.B. say?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.768
I don't know,
some story about

04:27.801 --> 04:29.537
terrifying bacteria he found?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.472
But he'd also tell us
that if we can't

04:31.505 --> 04:33.474
find a lead in the evidence,

04:33.507 --> 04:34.775
we have to look
for what's missing.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.477
A void.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.548
Interpol sends data
over fiber optic cable.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.483
Let's take a look
at the power output.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.717
Wait, Raven,
look at that.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.419
What do you see three days ago?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.588
I see a slight dip

04:47.621 --> 04:49.022
in the optical network
light output.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.324
Exactly.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.425
That's what's missing.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.060
Light-- that's what's missing?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.862
Yes!

04:54.895 --> 04:56.964
Fiber optic cables
run underneath the ocean

04:56.997 --> 04:58.666
from Europe to the U.S.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.735
They carry data over long
distances at light speed.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.537
The same amount of light
that goes in one end,

05:03.571 --> 05:06.574
always comes out the other.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.542
Except three days ago.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.880
Python must've put a tap

05:12.913 --> 05:16.484
on Interpol's dedicated
fiber optic line,

05:16.517 --> 05:20.020
connecting its U.S. offices
to European HQ...

05:20.053 --> 05:21.855
and started to steal data.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.090
This was fiber tapping.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.592
Flash Boys,
Wall Street.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.759
Direct line,
faster trades.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.462
Hey, Krumitz, you're not
even completing sentences here.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.463
Okay, try this.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.564
Is this your soda?

05:30.598 --> 05:31.565
Yes it is.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.401
If I punch a hole...

05:35.403 --> 05:36.704
Okay, it's going to leak,

05:36.737 --> 05:37.838
so I will get less.
Exactly.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.540
It's the same thing
with the fiber optic cable.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.542
Python tapped it;
punched a hole.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.076
So only a portion of their
light-carrying data

05:43.110 --> 05:44.778
made it from Europe
to America.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.547
Hmm.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.748
So the hack went unnoticed

05:47.781 --> 05:51.752
by Interpol for 72 hours.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.488
I think I can find where the
fiber optic line is leaking

05:54.522 --> 05:57.491
if I measure the travel time of
the information before it dips.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.394
KRUMITZ: That'll lead us
to Python's tap.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.699
Move, move, move, move,
move, move! Go, go, go!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.936
Raven said the
tap is here.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.103
NELSON:
It is.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.639
The GPS coordinates put the tap

06:11.672 --> 06:12.940
right in the middle
of this room.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.942
Clear.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.477
AGENT 1: Clear!
AGENT 2: Clear!

06:16.510 --> 06:17.578
All right, I'm getting closer.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.713
I'm standing right over it.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.553
The floorboards have been cut.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.020
Guys, right here!

06:39.867 --> 06:40.901
Clear!

06:42.470 --> 06:45.138
I got a hole,
an exposed fiber optic cable

06:45.172 --> 06:47.140
and a laptop-- we found
Python's fiber tap.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.016
Nelson, here's
the computer.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.994
All right, I'm starting forensic
analysis on Python's computer.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.061
This is everything being sent

07:08.095 --> 07:10.063
over Interpol's
fiber optic cable.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.733
You mean everything Python's
stealing with his fiber tap.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.867
I hate to admit it.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.636
But I've got
a case of hacker envy.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.638
Yeah, well, me, too.
Laptop I found in the hole

07:17.671 --> 07:19.740
was running sniffer software
that isolated Rupert's e-mail.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.141
And that's a complicated code
to write.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.877
So that's how Python knew
about Rupert's meeting.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.113
Python's good.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.782
Guys, Python is a
psychotic killer, okay?

07:28.816 --> 07:32.152
So can we tone down
the black hat worship?

07:32.185 --> 07:34.522
Okay, I've been writing
decryption software.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.824
And I just found an e-mail
from Rupert

07:36.857 --> 07:39.026
to his informant--
goes by the handle "Darko."

07:39.059 --> 07:40.628
Avery, Miguel?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.095
You should see this.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.768
RYAN:
"I have something that you want.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.203
"Something Python
doesn't want you to have.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.605
Let's meet."

07:51.639 --> 07:52.405
Okay, got two more e-mails,

07:52.439 --> 07:55.943
setting up date,
time and location.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.110
This is how Python
got to Rupert.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.111
RAMIREZ:
But what happened to Darko?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.814
Did he show up to the meeting?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.883
VEGA: "Can't meet today.
Too risky.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.051
Sorry."

08:04.084 --> 08:05.052
Wait a minute,
this e-mail was sent

08:05.085 --> 08:07.287
ten minutes after
the arranged meeting time.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.623
All right, so for some reason,

08:09.657 --> 08:12.125
Darko realized that
Python was on to him.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.594
If Darko didn't
make that meeting,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.295
he may still be alive.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.698
VEGA:
Well, that's good for us.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.232
He's got something
that made Python nervous.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.802
Yeah, but, but what?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.103
This.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.872
I just decrypted another e-mail.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.207
RYAN:
He has Python's real name?

08:27.240 --> 08:30.077
Anonymity is everything
in the Deep Web.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.714
This Darko holds the key to
I.D-ing and caging this snake.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.283
We have to find Darko
before Python kills him

08:36.316 --> 08:38.852
and he crawls back
into the Deep Web.

08:42.155 --> 08:48.261
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

08:50.197 --> 08:56.704
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

08:56.737 --> 08:59.973
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:00.007 --> 09:04.044
* I can see for miles
and miles *

09:04.077 --> 09:08.115
* I can see
for miles and miles *

09:08.148 --> 09:11.919
* And miles...

09:11.952 --> 09:12.953
* Oh, yeah.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.266
All right, everyone, listen up.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.835
We're looking for a hacker

09:27.868 --> 09:30.203
that goes by the handle Darko.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.773
I want you to scour every nook
and cranny of the Deep Web

09:32.806 --> 09:34.708
from disgusting chat rooms
to deviant forums.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.144
Darko's out there somewhere,
let's go.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.681
(indistinct chatter)

09:48.088 --> 09:51.024
*

10:15.949 --> 10:17.685
RUSSELL:
Okay, so we pass a current

10:17.718 --> 10:19.319
through this hydrochloric acid,

10:19.352 --> 10:21.088
and it should
remove the tool marks

10:21.121 --> 10:23.657
and reveal the serial numbers.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.058
Whew.
Huh.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.929
I got to be honest-- I didn't
think that was gonna work.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.130
Well, unfortunately,
we didn't get

10:30.163 --> 10:32.399
a complete serial number
off the gun.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.768
This is only a partial.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.138
But if we get partials
off the rest of these,

10:38.171 --> 10:40.240
maybe we can run an urgent trace
and get a lead on Python.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.242
Let's do the next one here.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.011
All right.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.213
That was the president
of Interpol.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.216
She wants the fiber tap
to be removed immediately.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.084
NELSON:
Man, that's a bad idea.
If we disrupt the connection,

10:51.118 --> 10:53.120
Python will know we found it.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.755
Interpol's not gonna let
Python continue stealing

10:54.788 --> 10:57.024
every secret we send over
the fiber optic cable.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.291
Python doesn't know
we found the tap.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.326
That gives us an advantage.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.360
We're gonna use it.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.433
Are you asking me not
to follow orders, Avery?

11:06.466 --> 11:09.202
I am asking you
to wait before you do.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.939
Always so unconventional.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.273
Miguel, send Darko

11:13.306 --> 11:16.409
an e-mail, introducing yourself
as Rupert's partner.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.911
Propose a meeting.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.179
Then send back a fake e-mail

11:19.212 --> 11:21.181
from Darko,
accepting the meeting,

11:21.214 --> 11:23.450
setting a time and a location.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.085
Python intercepts
these e-mails

11:25.118 --> 11:27.955
and walks himself
right into our sting.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.892
(typing)

11:31.925 --> 11:33.927
*

11:43.136 --> 11:45.205
All right, so what do we got?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.506
Finally got a hit on Darko.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.942
Then this came in--
a message from Python.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.078
What? "I'm looking for Darko--
dead or alive.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.846
"Help him and you're next.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.981
"And to the Interpol agent

11:54.014 --> 11:55.282
"planning the Times Square
sting...

11:55.315 --> 11:56.449
Nice try. Python."

11:56.483 --> 11:58.919
Python saw through
Avery's sting;

11:58.952 --> 12:00.120
now he's gloating.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.123
God, this guy just loves showing
everybody he's the smartest.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.793
Somehow, Python knew
we found the fiber tap.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.394
I mean, guy's a hacker god.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.763
No, he's just a man.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.531
And eventually,
he's gonna make a mistake.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.800
What did you
find on Darko

12:12.833 --> 12:13.934
before we got
Python's message?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.869
RAMIREZ:
Well, we found a solid lead.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.538
Turns out he's been selling
what hackers call "fullz"--

12:18.571 --> 12:20.440
full packages
of personal info

12:20.473 --> 12:23.143
stolen from big corporate hacks
like Target or Home Depot.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.212
And this is the Web site
where he sells 'em.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.414
MUNDO:
Name, birth date
and Social Security number.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.149
Holy trinity of identity fraud.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.285
RAMIREZ:
Hey, isn't that one of
your confidential informants?

12:32.319 --> 12:33.320
Fresh!

12:33.353 --> 12:35.055
It's been too long

12:35.088 --> 12:36.423
since I had a chat
with my favorite C.I.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.458
I bet he's feeling
neglected right now.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.494
Bernie Renard.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.197
Let's skip the foreplay today
and just cut right to it.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.099
Please, I'd really prefer
to be called by my handle.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.100
"Fresh."

12:47.134 --> 12:48.235
You got it.
So, Bernie,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.437
you've recently done business
with a hacker named Darko.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.472
Tell me everything
you know about him.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.907
I ain't saying a damn thing,

12:53.941 --> 12:55.909
especially not
after Python's warning.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.310
That's all
anybody's talking about.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.912
Well, here's my warning.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.814
Tell me
what you know

13:00.848 --> 13:01.748
or I'm arresting you

13:01.781 --> 13:03.050
for that little business
you just started.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.385
That's right.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.120
We know all about the fullz.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.594
Well, I'd rather be
alive and in jail

13:14.627 --> 13:16.429
than, you know...
dead and stuff.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.865
VEGA:
Renard.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.967
Is your family from Toulouse?

13:21.601 --> 13:22.569
Yeah.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.904
Moved here when I was six.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.272
VEGA:
Yeah, I was born in Spain.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.007
But my family moved
around Europe a lot.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.010
I lived just outside of Paris
for five years.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.045
Uh... congratulations.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.247
Yeah, thanks.
I enjoyed it.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.216
So here's what happens
if you don't help us.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.151
I'm going to hang a digital
snitch jacket on you

13:38.185 --> 13:39.286
and leak onto the wire

13:39.319 --> 13:41.421
the details of
your FBI agreement.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.223
Go right ahead, man.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.058
Half the guys on the wire

13:45.092 --> 13:46.326
are tipsters
for law enforcement.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
(speaking French)

13:51.131 --> 13:53.133
(speaking French)

14:06.914 --> 14:08.648
This guy is threatening my life.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.118
I think that's, like, against
the law or something, right?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.986
Sorry, Bernie.
I don't speak French.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.654
I have no way of knowing
what he just said.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.990
Uh, but just
a heads up...

14:17.024 --> 14:19.292
Python recently killed
Agent Vega's partner.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.295
He needs to take his
anger out on someone

14:22.329 --> 14:25.165
and you would satisfy that need.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.039
What happened to us, Elijah?

14:32.072 --> 14:33.573
I thought we were friends.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.575
How do you say in French:
"You thought wrong"?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.911
(speaks French)

14:37.945 --> 14:38.912
That.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.547
Now, Bernie,

14:40.580 --> 14:43.550
tell me everything
you know about Darko.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.422
VEGA:
Darko's real name
is Teddy Frankle.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.657
Does Interpol
have a file on him?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.025
Unfortunately, no.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.393
He's a British ex-pat

14:53.426 --> 14:54.527
living in
the U.S. illegally.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.328
He works
off the books

14:55.362 --> 14:57.564
at a Baltimore
e-waste facility.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.367
So Darko gets his fullz by
stealing personal information

15:00.400 --> 15:03.036
off of users' hard drives
before they're recycled.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.537
Except when he
stumbles across

15:04.571 --> 15:07.074
the personal info
of someone valuable.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.376
Then he tries to sell it
back to them for a fee.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.044
Well, that's a clever
ransom operation.

15:11.078 --> 15:14.081
Darko must've tried
his little scam on Python,

15:14.114 --> 15:15.615
which is how Python knows
what Darko has.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.783
Recovering
a computer

15:16.816 --> 15:19.586
with info on Python would
be like finding a gold mine.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.454
But why would the snake

15:21.488 --> 15:23.056
ever recycle one of
his old computers?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.993
Well, Python
wasn't always Python.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.028
Maybe he didn't wipe
his drive well enough

15:28.061 --> 15:30.230
or maybe it was stolen.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.132
Darko might be able
to tell us more.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.666
Baltimore PD
raided the facility

15:33.700 --> 15:35.468
and the apartment
Darko was squatting in,

15:35.502 --> 15:37.270
but he disappeared yesterday.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.371
But we did
get one lead.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.306
Darko reached out

15:39.339 --> 15:41.608
to Elijah's C.I.
on the wire this morning,

15:41.641 --> 15:44.211
looking to unload a block of
fullz for some quick cash,

15:44.244 --> 15:45.678
so he can go
on the run.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.380
The C.I. turned Darko down.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.316
We have to start
searching the Deep Web

15:49.349 --> 15:51.051
for auction sites
where fullz are sold.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.986
That's where we'll find Darko.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.557
RUSSELL:
Okay, this is the last one.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.359
"Blank, blank,
three, four, one."

15:59.392 --> 16:01.028
What do you think Python's

16:01.061 --> 16:02.229
real name
is gonna be?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.463
For some reason, I feel like

16:03.496 --> 16:05.198
it's gonna be
something quirky, like...

16:05.232 --> 16:07.434
Ichabod or Jarvis.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.102
Nah, that's not
weird enough.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.205
I'm thinking... Yoserian.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.374
How about Diebenkorn?
(laughs)

16:14.407 --> 16:17.344
Hey, my-my parents named me
after a very famous artist,

16:17.377 --> 16:18.745
just so you know.
Okay.

16:18.778 --> 16:19.979
Geez.
Just run
the numbers.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.416
All right, the partials spit out
a bunch of possible matches.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.018
Now we just need to figure out

16:25.052 --> 16:27.354
which serial numbers
connect to Python's guns.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.061
RUSSELL:
Oh. Henry Hayes,
Henry Hayes, Henry Hayes,

16:34.094 --> 16:35.162
Henry Hayes.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.163
I mean, it can't
be a coincidence

16:36.196 --> 16:37.197
that this guy bought

16:37.230 --> 16:38.665
all four of these four guns.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.767
Python's real name
is Henry Hayes.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.635
Guess his parents were not
as creative as mine.

16:42.669 --> 16:47.140
Okay, I'm gonna send Python's
real name and address to Elijah.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.741
Our work here is done,
Diebenkorn.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.211
(chuckles)
Boom!
Boom.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.354
Clear!

17:01.388 --> 17:03.156
Clear!
Clear!

17:03.190 --> 17:04.424
MUNDO:
It's a live feed.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.060
Python just made us.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.603
VEGA:
Wait, we can't be sure.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.471
Maybe he's not
monitoring this feed.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.243
(sighs)

17:34.887 --> 17:36.489
Henry Hayes' file is thin.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.624
Anorexic, even.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.758
Born in New York.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.193
He's got a Social
Security number,

17:40.227 --> 17:41.861
a credit report,
and nothing else.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.730
He has no previous address

17:43.763 --> 17:45.665
and zero presence
on social media.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.268
Because he only exists on paper.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.237
Python created him.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.871
Everything about
Henry Hayes is fake.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.140
He's a shelf baby.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.508
I'm sorry...
are we chasing a ghost?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.877
More like a virtual identity
created by a hacker.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.279
It's frighteningly easy

17:59.312 --> 18:00.647
to register
a Social Security number,

18:00.680 --> 18:01.648
a birth certificate,

18:01.681 --> 18:02.682
even medical records...

18:02.715 --> 18:04.717
all in the name of someone
who doesn't even exist.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.853
A hacker "gives birth"
to a shelf baby,

18:06.886 --> 18:09.622
then waits-- in real time--
while it "grows up."

18:09.656 --> 18:11.891
Then, when the shelf baby
turns 16,

18:11.924 --> 18:13.426
the hacker gives it
a driver's license.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.462
MUNDO:
When the shelf baby
graduates high school,

18:15.495 --> 18:16.463
it gets a diploma.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.730
Some hackers get creative

18:17.764 --> 18:19.866
and give their shelf babies
braces, glasses,

18:19.899 --> 18:22.202
invitations to prom.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.571
Anything to sell the illusion
of a real person.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.772
So when the shelf baby turns 18,

18:25.805 --> 18:27.374
they're now an adult
that the hacker can use

18:27.407 --> 18:28.808
as a throw-away identity
to commit crimes.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.444
MUNDO:
Takes a massive
amount of patience

18:31.478 --> 18:32.579
to properly raise a shelf baby.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.646
Henry Hayes was rushed

18:33.680 --> 18:35.515
because Python needed him
to buy guns immediately.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.883
So, rather than
wait the 18 years

18:36.916 --> 18:38.385
for Henry to "grow up,"

18:38.418 --> 18:40.253
he just simply backdated
all the paperwork.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.421
Which explains
all the digital

18:41.454 --> 18:43.190
holes in Henry's life.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.391
Python is playing with us.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.226
He' making us look
like amateurs.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.727
Can we trace
the video camera's signal?

18:47.760 --> 18:48.728
RYAN:
No.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.230
Just like the laptop

18:50.263 --> 18:51.631
was connected
to Python's fiber tap,

18:51.664 --> 18:53.933
this video is going
right into the Deep Web.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.903
Where everything is untraceable.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.507
RYAN:
What do we got, Raven?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.775
Hey. An anonymous
seller just posted

19:02.809 --> 19:05.412
a massive block of fullz
on a Deep Web auction site.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.280
He wants cash immediately after
the auction closes.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.581
Delivered in person.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.816
That's Darko.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.817
Yeah, he's unloading
what he's got and fast.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.319
RAMIREZ:
I exploited a bug

19:12.352 --> 19:13.586
on the auction site's
messaging software.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.422
Now we can eavesdrop
on all the messages

19:15.455 --> 19:18.291
sent between the seller and
whoever placed the winning bid.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.193
Looks like
the auction's closing.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.462
Okay, looks
like we're in.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.730
Here's where
the sale's going down.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.465
"Baltimore Boat Yard.
3:00 p.m.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.267
Cash. Yellow backpack."

19:27.300 --> 19:29.269
Okay, so Python wants Darko
as much as we do.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.570
How do we know
he didn't win the auction?

19:30.603 --> 19:31.704
Actually, we're hoping he did.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.872
That's why SWAT
will be backing us up.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.708
*

19:40.380 --> 19:41.981
MUNDO:
All right, guys
Look alive.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.583
Remember, we're looking
for a yellow backpack.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.185
(indistinct radio chatter)

19:49.356 --> 19:51.491
All right, boys,
keep your eyes open.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.327
(Vega chuckles)

19:54.361 --> 19:56.463
This was Rupert's
favorite part.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.766
The stillness before
all the craziness started.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.502
Do you remember Paris?

20:02.535 --> 20:03.970
Oh...
He was changing
his socks

20:04.003 --> 20:06.606
when the target
suddenly appeared.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.975
He ran up 32 flights of stairs

20:09.008 --> 20:09.976
barefoot.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.779
Yep.
He broke two toes,
but he got the guy.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.614
He got the guy.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.585
You know,
Elijah reminds me of Rupert.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.652
Mmm.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.888
Calm, strong, reliable...

20:21.921 --> 20:24.791
I can see why
you chose him.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.929
All right. Sweep is complete.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.030
Team is in position.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.365
Darko is not getting away.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.500
SWAT OFFICER:
Roof team here.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.034
We've got eyes
on the yellow backpack.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.870
North side of the harbor,
by the warehouse.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.772
Team Two, point; Team One,
containment. Let's move.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.908
*

20:44.677 --> 20:47.280
SWAT OFFICER 2:
I have subject in sight.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.654
Teddy Frankle! FBI!

20:54.687 --> 20:55.688
VEGA:
Stay on him!

20:55.722 --> 20:57.357
FBI!

20:57.390 --> 20:58.925
Hands in the air,
right now!

20:58.958 --> 21:00.026
Hands in
the air, now!
Put 'em up!

21:00.059 --> 21:01.661
Very slowly,

21:01.694 --> 21:03.296
remove your backpack.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.438
MUNDO: That's good.
Put it on the ground.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.308
Hands back up in the air.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.809
(gunshot)

21:16.843 --> 21:19.712
Whoa, sniper, get down!
Take cover!
(gunshots)

21:19.746 --> 21:20.980
Sniper. Get down.
Stay low.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.749
Drag him over here!

21:22.782 --> 21:23.816
Cover!

21:23.850 --> 21:25.552
(shouting)

21:25.585 --> 21:27.487
Top of the floating dock!

21:28.788 --> 21:29.889
Move, move.
Get him to cover.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.758
Move it.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.626
RYAN:
Cover, cover.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.061
I need EMTs on the dock.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.596
Our suspect has been shot.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.800
Move, move, move!

21:40.833 --> 21:43.370
(shouting)

21:47.106 --> 21:48.641
Teddy, help is on the way.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.076
What is Python's name?

21:50.109 --> 21:51.411
Teddy? Teddy?

21:51.444 --> 21:52.445
Stay with me.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.813
Teddy, stay with me.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.917
(whirring)

22:15.134 --> 22:16.603
MUNDO:
Avery, there's no shooter.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.004
Sniper rifle
with remote control.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.572
Bluetooth enabled.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.474
What is Python's name? Teddy!

22:21.508 --> 22:23.009
Teddy!

22:23.042 --> 22:25.378
(gasping)
Python's name is in my...

22:25.412 --> 22:27.514
in my laptop.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.517
Teddy?

22:34.086 --> 22:35.555
(sighs)

22:35.588 --> 22:36.589
(groans)

22:43.596 --> 22:45.665
Darko's laptop was infected
with spyware.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.899
Someone was monitoring him.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.168
Python, that's how he knew where
the meeting was being held.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.603
I mean, look at his coding.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.472
I mean, there's no pattern
to the functions.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.606
It's pure poetry.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.842
Guys! What is Python's name?

22:57.143 --> 22:58.945
Look, Avery, I don't know
what to tell you.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.413
Laptop's got nothing on it.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.082
The last thing Darko said
was "Python's name

23:03.115 --> 23:04.684
is on that laptop."

23:04.717 --> 23:06.152
I already had a friend who died.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.687
Find it

23:07.720 --> 23:08.888
and find it now.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.093
*

23:21.868 --> 23:24.136
MUNDO:
432

23:24.170 --> 23:25.638
015.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.743
One remote sniper rifle,
a dozen different parts.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.844
(sighs)

23:31.878 --> 23:33.112
All with different
serial numbers.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.914
All purchased
by different people

23:34.947 --> 23:36.883
and all used
in different crimes.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.886
Even the tripod,
the laptop, the ammo.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.053
MUNDO:
Python did rule over

23:41.087 --> 23:42.655
an empire of Deep Web criminals.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.458
These could all be contacts made
while running Squamata.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.593
Let me run a quick

23:46.626 --> 23:48.060
identity history on them.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.796
RUSSELL: Python's certainly
living up to his reputation,

23:49.829 --> 23:52.465
isn't he?
Pablo Escobar of the Deep Web.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.066
MUNDO: His Web site,
Squamata, brings is

23:54.100 --> 23:56.736
over $30 million a year
in drug revenue.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.738
A third of that is
from college kids.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.608
Python's drugs are just
too easy to get.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.643
All it takes
is a click of a mouse

24:03.676 --> 24:04.911
or the swipe of a screen.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.613
Then drugs are delivered
within hours.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.515
Been chasing this guy
for over a year.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.518
RUSSELL: Not only do we have
to find this guy,

24:11.551 --> 24:14.654
but we have to take down
his site, Squamata.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.658
MUNDO: Think of how many people
his drugs

24:18.691 --> 24:19.892
have killed during that time.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.160
And how many more people
are gonna die

24:21.193 --> 24:22.495
if we don't stop him.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.502
That's weird.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.272
Really weird. Look at this.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.976
All 12 of those people live
at the same address,

24:37.009 --> 24:39.712
delivered by the same doctor
at the same hospital.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.748
(sighs) There all shelf babies.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.183
Python's army of shelf babies.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.752
These documents
are flawless.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.654
This guy's a master forger.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.088
All right, all right,
so everybody who bought

24:49.121 --> 24:50.590
the sniper rifle,
they're a dead end.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.258
Did we have any luck tracking

24:52.291 --> 24:54.527
the source
of the weapon's remote commands?

24:54.561 --> 24:56.162
It received commands
through the Deep Web.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.597
Again, untraceable.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.599
I can see why this guy's not
in custody.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.167
Every bit of evidence,

25:01.200 --> 25:02.735
whether it's physical
or digital,

25:02.769 --> 25:05.071
runs right into a wall.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.008
Ran the search three times,
Krummy.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.243
There aren't
any hidden partitions.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.879
Just hit the damn
enter key again, Nelson.

25:12.912 --> 25:13.880
It's not that hard.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.715
Look, I might be smaller,
but I fight dirty.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.783
Now drop the attitude,
before I take this laptop

25:16.816 --> 25:19.586
and break it over
that watermelon you call a head.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.988
Break this laptop.

25:22.021 --> 25:22.922
Yeah, that's what I said.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.056
Yeah?
You're a genius.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.726
You shut... Wait, what?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.294
Python's name isn't
in the laptop, it's...

25:28.327 --> 25:29.996
it's in the laptop.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.698
Okay, look, I appreciate
the props, Krummy,

25:31.731 --> 25:33.800
but you sound insane right now.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.201
Where do extremely
paranoid hackers

25:35.234 --> 25:36.703
hide data they don't want found?

25:36.736 --> 25:38.237
Offline.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.240
Oh, I am a genius.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.242
And the laptop...
Get the glass board.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.277
Mm-hmm.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.255
KRUMITZ:
Somewhere inside this laptop,

25:56.288 --> 25:58.725
Darko physically
hid information on Python.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.260
We could be looking
for a chip or a thumb drive.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.995
I'll bring up the schematic
on Darko's laptop.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.232
We're looking for the part
that isn't supposed to be there.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.902
*

26:21.147 --> 26:23.049
These are
the main components.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.022
It's not here.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.924
That ribbon cable
look odd to you?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.926
Lift it.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.162
Bingo.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.164
You can slither,
but you cannot hide.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.766
(chuckles)

26:39.799 --> 26:41.834
That's right.

26:41.868 --> 26:45.037
Avery, I'd like to introduce you
to Robert Corto,

26:45.071 --> 26:46.673
aka Python,

26:46.706 --> 26:49.642
aka number one on Cyber's
most wanted list.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.010
Real name, birth date, address,

26:51.043 --> 26:52.344
social security number,
the works.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.646
And the best part?

26:53.680 --> 26:54.914
We know this is Python,

26:54.947 --> 26:56.315
because the chip also contained

26:56.348 --> 26:58.651
original source code
from his Deep Web marketplace,

26:58.685 --> 27:00.219
Squamata.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.921
Robert Corto is another
shelf baby.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.824
KRUMITZ:
What? No.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.859
She's right.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.828
We were so excited
we got Robert Corto's name,

27:08.861 --> 27:10.196
we didn't even look
at his address.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.063
The same address

27:11.097 --> 27:13.132
as all the shelf babies,
Freeside Street.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.767
Wait, no.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.302
Something's not adding up.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.270
Python murdered two people

27:18.304 --> 27:19.138
to get this chip.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.673
What was on it
that was so important

27:20.707 --> 27:21.741
he'd be willing to kill?

27:21.774 --> 27:22.875
Not a shelf baby.

27:22.909 --> 27:23.943
Guy must have had dozens.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.779
Maybe he was protecting
Squamata's source code.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.881
An early beta version
with no login credentials?

27:28.915 --> 27:30.082
It's hardly worth anything.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.350
All right. (sighs)

27:31.383 --> 27:33.285
Tell me everything you
guys found on that chip.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.154
Yeah, it was just

27:35.187 --> 27:37.323
Robert Corto's information,
the code to Squamata.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.959
Bunch of half-written
executables, scripts,

27:39.992 --> 27:41.894
text file that's pretty big.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.195
Mmm, and old zero days
and their patches.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.831
RYAN:
Wait, back up.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.665
Text file?
Put that up on the screen.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.035
KRUMITZ:
What is that?

27:49.068 --> 27:50.703
NELSON:
Looks like a journal.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.304
Not just any journal.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.406
Python's.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.942
This is what he was after.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.810
He came out of hiding

27:57.844 --> 27:59.846
to erase a connection
to his past.

28:01.247 --> 28:05.351
This journal must have the key
to Python's true identity.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.053
Print every single page.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.056
VEGA:
Python's private thoughts

28:10.089 --> 28:11.958
spilled out on the page.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.726
It's like looking into his mind.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.195
Why do you think
he started keeping a journal?

28:16.228 --> 28:18.164
A little boy with no friends

28:18.197 --> 28:20.232
has to express
his feelings somewhere.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.334
Oh, he did plenty of expressing,

28:22.368 --> 28:24.103
but he never gave away
his identity.

28:24.136 --> 28:27.506
He shows an extreme amount
of control.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.076
He began
isolating himself early.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.844
Even cut ties with family.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.846
Look.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.883
A decision he
struggled over.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.051
All of this to protect
his anonymity.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.821
He knew the moment Squamata
went online,

28:41.854 --> 28:43.823
his identity would be
his Achilles' heel.

28:43.856 --> 28:44.957
So he shed it.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.859
Yeah, that's not
the only thing he shed.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.165
"Psoriasis."

28:53.199 --> 28:55.401
Hereditary condition
where skin cells slough off.

28:55.434 --> 28:56.936
Yeah, there's pages
and pages here

28:56.969 --> 28:58.170
about the teasing
he suffered. Look.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.272
Kids called him "snake skin,"

29:00.306 --> 29:02.875
"lizard arms," and "python."

29:02.909 --> 29:06.112
He didn't give himself
the name Python.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.514
It was given to him by kids
who were mocking him.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.316
He took a name that was meant
to demean him,

29:10.349 --> 29:11.818
and turned it
into a source of strength.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.819
(phone buzzes)

29:12.852 --> 29:15.287
Raven's got something.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.356
RAMIREZ: Hey, D.B. and I
were looking at the 12

29:17.389 --> 29:19.826
shelf babies
that bought the sniper rifle.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.027
He spotted something.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.528
Look at this.
They're all character names.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.964
It looks like all 12
of Python's shelf babies

29:24.997 --> 29:26.532
are taken from novels.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.935
The hospital, the doctor,
the street where they live,

29:28.968 --> 29:30.169
even the people themselves.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.303
Right, but they're
all jumbled up,

29:31.337 --> 29:33.039
so you add Phoebe
from Phoebe Lee

29:33.072 --> 29:34.941
to Caulfield
from John Caulfield...

29:34.974 --> 29:37.509
RYAN: You get Phoebe Caulfield
from The Catcher in the Rye.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.911
Right, this first name,
that last name,

29:38.945 --> 29:40.012
and they're a blend

29:40.046 --> 29:42.281
of characters
from different novels.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.516
One of them
is Catcher in the Rye,

29:44.550 --> 29:45.484
but I'm having trouble
figuring out the other ones.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.853
RAMIREZ: I get it.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.187
Take Molly from Molly Ackley,

29:48.220 --> 29:49.355
and Millions from
Jane Millions,

29:49.388 --> 29:51.323
you get Molly Millions.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.591
It's from Neuromancer.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.026
Godfather of cyberpunk.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.461
It's pretty much

29:55.494 --> 29:57.429
required reading for black hats.
It's like the Bible.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.031
He picked these novels
specifically.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.833
They mean something to him.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.001
Raven, pull up

30:02.034 --> 30:03.169
digital copies if each book,

30:03.202 --> 30:05.972
and then run a search
on all the characters.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.910
All right, Linda Lee and
Henry Dorsett Case

30:10.943 --> 30:12.511
both from Neuromancer.

30:12.544 --> 30:13.913
D.B.'s theory's working.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.949
RUSSELL: There's only one
name that doesn't match.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.117
Renetta Wilkerson.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.252
The outlier.
She's not from the books.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.121
Maybe a character
from a third book.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.856
Or maybe she really exists.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.993
I'll run her name.
Most criminals who
assume a new identity

30:27.026 --> 30:28.427
can't completely walk away
from their past.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.429
They stay connected to someone.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.865
A sibling, a girlfriend,
a parent.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.300
Renetta Wilkerson

30:34.333 --> 30:36.568
may be someone
from Python's former life.

30:36.602 --> 30:37.569
All right,
these are all the addresses

30:37.603 --> 30:39.906
for that name. They're
all over the country.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.273
Wichita, Seattle, Pittsburgh.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.910
I want FBI teams
at each of those house ASAP.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.378
One of these women
is connected to Python.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.547
Well, checking that many people
is gonna take times.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.082
RAMIREZ: Maybe there's something
in the journal

30:50.116 --> 30:51.183
that can help us.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.384
Right.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.920
Python wrote

30:53.953 --> 30:56.055
about being teased for
his skin condition.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.323
Did he ever mention
the first time

30:57.356 --> 30:58.624
he was given the name Python?

30:58.657 --> 31:00.559
He did.

31:07.967 --> 31:08.935
Okay, it happened
at the summer camp,

31:08.968 --> 31:10.502
but he never says
where the camp is located.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.071
RYAN: Read the passage.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.273
"Today at the lake,
the counselors made us

31:14.306 --> 31:15.507
"all take off our T-shirts.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.642
"Cam made a comment.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.010
"He said I had snake skin.

31:18.044 --> 31:18.877
"He called my Python.

31:18.911 --> 31:20.512
"Everyone started
calling me Python.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.680
"They think it's funny.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.349
"I hate it here.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.051
"The only nice person is Irene.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.385
"She takes me on nature walks.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.287
"We look for birds' nests
in the grass.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.689
"She told me the reason the
male birds have black bodies

31:30.722 --> 31:33.692
and white-tipped wings
is to attract a female."

31:33.725 --> 31:35.227
Male birds, black body,
white wings,

31:35.261 --> 31:37.296
makes a nest in the ground--
that's awfully specific.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.497
Rav--?

31:38.530 --> 31:40.299
I am already on it, D.B.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.567
RUSSELL:
He's talking about
a lark bunting.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.303
That's the state bird
from Colorado.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.305
RAMIREZ: I got a Renetta
Wilkerson in Colorado.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.574
Okay, Raven, call
the regional office.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.177
Get agents at that house
until we arrive.

31:56.315 --> 31:59.285
(indistinct chatter)

32:04.023 --> 32:06.492
Renetta Wilkerson, FBI!

32:08.360 --> 32:09.561
Renetta Wilkerson?

32:09.595 --> 32:11.597
Yes?
Do you have a son?

32:11.630 --> 32:14.500
Yes...
Is he currently living here?

32:14.533 --> 32:17.636
No, I mean, Dante hasn't
lived here in over 20 years.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.144
Dante went missing
when he was 14.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.245
The police said
that he ran away.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.613
But in my heart,

32:27.646 --> 32:30.316
I knew he was abducted.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.352
So, he has never been back?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.754
No, that Tuesday in February was
the last time that I saw him.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.123
It was snowing.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.491
Well, his room is over here.

32:39.525 --> 32:43.295
I mean, I go in
once in a while and dust,

32:43.329 --> 32:45.331
but it's exactly
the same as it was.

32:49.035 --> 32:52.138
I always hoped
he'd come home someday.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.278
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:02.448 --> 33:03.782
Dante loved computers.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.019
I could never
figure them out.

33:07.053 --> 33:07.853
I still can't.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.224
But he would build
them in his room.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.660
He would stay in here for hours.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.230
He wasn't a very social child.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.801
I don't see any pictures.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.336
Do you have a photo of Dante?

33:24.370 --> 33:26.805
I used to have
a shoe box full of them.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.142
But I don't know, I just--

33:31.543 --> 33:32.711
It just got too painful.

33:32.744 --> 33:36.182
So I... got rid of them
a long time ago.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.284
I have one picture though.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.693
He was just 14
years old then.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.238
That computer looks new.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.073
I thought you said you know
nothing about computers.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.341
I won it.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.742
I always loved the sweepstakes.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.213
And Dante and I would fill in
these forms together

34:07.246 --> 34:08.847
when he was a kid.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.450
(chuckles)
We always lost.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.085
But wouldn't you know it?

34:13.119 --> 34:14.586
A year after he disappeared,

34:14.620 --> 34:16.588
I finally won.

34:16.622 --> 34:17.856
A free computer

34:17.889 --> 34:20.426
with a yearly
upgrade for life.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.630
Every January a new
computer shows up.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.499
I plug it in, I turn
it on and I leave it.

34:29.235 --> 34:32.704
I want him to have the latest
model if he'd just come home.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.713
Call me.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.519
(phone buzzing)

34:58.430 --> 34:59.498
Hello, Dante.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.233
It's so much nicer not to have
to call you Python.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.668
Dante? No, Dante...
I'm sorry, ma'am.

35:02.701 --> 35:03.669
Listen, we're gonna
take care of this.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.736
Is that my Dante?

35:04.770 --> 35:05.771
You need to step aside--

35:05.804 --> 35:06.905
Did you hear that?

35:06.938 --> 35:07.906
Can you imagine
the amount of pain

35:07.939 --> 35:09.641
you've caused this poor woman?

35:09.675 --> 35:11.777
My mom's house.
You're in my house.

35:11.810 --> 35:15.514
It was clever of you to use her
love of sweepstakes to bring in

35:15.547 --> 35:17.783
a RAT-ed computer
so you could watch her.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.452
Socially engineering
and spying on your own mother?

35:20.486 --> 35:21.820
It doesn't get lower than that.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.422
Now, now, Avery Ryan.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.492
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.327
Actually, I do, Dante Wilkerson.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.362
I've learned quite a lot
about you

35:30.396 --> 35:32.664
reading your journals--
your hopes, your fears,

35:32.698 --> 35:34.600
your insecurities.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.168
But it was your bedroom.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.669
That is when I finally
saw the real you.

35:37.703 --> 35:38.737
My bedroom?

35:38.770 --> 35:41.207
You're grasping at straws,
Deputy Director Ryan.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.908
You have nothing!

35:42.941 --> 35:44.510
A scantily clad model
on your wall?

35:44.543 --> 35:46.678
That's as close as you
ever got to a real girl.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.515
You had every
game console on the market,

35:49.548 --> 35:51.883
but only had one controller
for each one.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.285
A little boy with no friends?

35:53.319 --> 35:55.187
Why would he need
another controller?

35:55.221 --> 35:56.622
You have three sets
of sheets

35:56.655 --> 35:58.724
folded in your closet,
at the ready.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.226
Is that because you were
still wetting the bed

36:00.259 --> 36:01.227
when you were a teenager?

36:01.260 --> 36:02.494
Just shut your mouth!

36:02.528 --> 36:04.896
I underestimated you.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.265
You savor this victory.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.666
It'll be your last.

36:07.699 --> 36:08.834
I'll have the site
back up tomorrow.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.536
You crossed a line.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.671
You've made this personal.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.706
This is war.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.784
What?
He just said he
would get the site

36:25.817 --> 36:28.954
back up by tomorrow
as if us taking it down

36:28.987 --> 36:30.956
was a foregone conclusion.

36:30.989 --> 36:31.923
That makes no sense.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.859
We don't know
where he hosts the Web site,

36:33.892 --> 36:35.727
Squamata-- it could be
anywhere in the world.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.496
But he thinks we do.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.997
Now, why would he think that?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.433
Unless... it's here.
It's in this house!

36:41.467 --> 36:44.603
Krumitz, is Squamata being
hosted on that computer?

36:44.636 --> 36:46.605
What? No.
No, it's not even possible.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.340
It doesn't even have
the right software.

36:48.374 --> 36:51.577
Wait, you-you think Squamata
is being hosted here?

36:51.610 --> 36:52.778
Python just let something slip.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.281
It is here.
It is in this house.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.449
There has to be
a server blade somewhere.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.836
Whoa.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.272
Avery, I found a server blade!

37:21.907 --> 37:23.642
So, is that it?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.677
There's only one
way to find out.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.713
Okay.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.465
This is it!
This is it!

37:46.498 --> 37:48.867
This is the computer
hosting Squamata.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.438
Wait! Wait! Wait, no!
Everything's being deleted--

37:52.471 --> 37:54.873
RYAN:
Python's deleting evidence that
connects him to the Deep Web.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.576
How do you stop it?
I-I don't know.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.682
You do the one thing you're
never supposed to do

38:03.715 --> 38:05.717
to a computer that's
being used in a crime.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.420
You unplug it.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.625
(all cheering)

38:14.760 --> 38:17.095
Oh, no, please, thank you.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.530
Thank you.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.699
Thank you so much.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.101
Hey, you be careful
with that, okay?

38:23.134 --> 38:24.936
It's only the most important
piece of hardware

38:24.970 --> 38:26.772
I've ever put my hands on.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.507
I understand.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.908
Just dusting it for prints.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.843
Look at that smile!

38:31.877 --> 38:34.079
If it was any bigger,
I think his head

38:34.112 --> 38:35.113
would split in half.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.682
Yeah, well, can
you blame him?

38:36.715 --> 38:38.350
He found Squamata's
host computer.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.852
RAMIREZ: And we've taken
down Python's drug empire.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.355
Now we got a complete list
of every supplier, dealer

38:43.389 --> 38:44.723
and distributor
who ever logged on.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.757
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.626
Take it in, Krummy.
Take it in.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.597
Any idea on how Python got
that blade into his old bedroom?

38:51.630 --> 38:53.131
Yeah, he RAT-ed
his own mom's computer.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.800
Observed her pattern of life.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.535
Knew when she'd be
out of the house.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.638
And now we've shut down
his enterprise.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.041
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, baby!
Yes! (whoops)

39:04.843 --> 39:07.012
Krumitz sent me a scan of
the photo from the milk carton.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.014
I ran it through
an age progression program.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.982
So this is Python today.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.018
Not exactly,
but close.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.862
VEGA:
Avery?

39:23.895 --> 39:25.030
Interpol agents
in eight countries

39:25.063 --> 39:27.833
just hit Python's biggest
suppliers and distributors.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.001
They seized hundreds of
kilos of narcotics

39:30.035 --> 39:31.637
and made more than 90 arrests.

39:31.670 --> 39:32.904
You know,
when the dust settles,

39:32.938 --> 39:34.172
this will go down
as one of the biggest

39:34.205 --> 39:36.575
international raids in history.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.109
Rupert would have enjoyed this.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.411
Are you kidding me?

39:39.445 --> 39:40.812
He would already be
slurring his way

39:40.846 --> 39:42.748
through some drinking song
he just made up.

39:42.781 --> 39:43.982
(both laugh)

39:45.684 --> 39:49.955
You know the best part about
working a case with Rupert?

39:51.056 --> 39:53.124
It never got boring.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.192
(laughing):
No.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.927
(chuckles)

39:55.961 --> 39:59.064
No, it wasn't.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.534
I'm really gonna miss him.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.570
Me, too, Miguel.

40:06.605 --> 40:10.041
He traded his life to expose
Python's true identity.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.679
I just wish that Rupert knew
how close his lead on Darko

40:13.712 --> 40:15.614
got us to catching the snake.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.116
I'd like to believe he does.

40:21.653 --> 40:22.888
(quiet laugh)

40:24.956 --> 40:26.792
VEGA:
Python's site is down.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.827
But the snake will be back.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.962
And when he is, we'll be ready.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.898
Fly safe, Miguel.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.165
Thank you.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.934
Take care.

40:49.715 --> 40:51.983
(line ringing)

40:52.017 --> 40:55.020
D.B., bring your print kit
to my office.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.672
That's a match to the one

41:13.705 --> 41:15.807
I pulled off Python's
server blade.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.950
This print belongs
to Dante Wilkerson.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.753
Python was here.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.855
But how's that possible?
In your office?

41:29.888 --> 41:31.757
How?

41:31.790 --> 41:33.825
(all clamoring in celebration)

41:37.663 --> 41:39.598
The maintenance man.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.277
KRUMITZ:
Man!

41:52.310 --> 41:54.813
(blows kisses)
Thank you so much.

42:01.787 --> 42:04.055
RYAN:
He walked right by us,
close enough to touch.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.591
RUSSELL:
You went to Python's house.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.659
He came to yours.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.061
And he came to leave something
more than a hand print.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.063
You said this guy was
capable of anything?

42:12.097 --> 42:14.265
And he is-- with this kind
of physical access?

42:14.299 --> 42:17.168
He could've put a virus
on our network or a RAT.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.737
Something that lies dormant.

42:18.770 --> 42:21.673
We wouldn't even be able
to find it until it's too late.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.208
Python wasn't kidding.

42:23.241 --> 42:24.342
This is war.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.144
(indistinct chatter)

42:26.177 --> 42:28.680
Python was here!

42:28.714 --> 42:29.915
In CTOC!

42:29.948 --> 42:31.082
Sweep everything!

42:31.116 --> 42:33.018
Contract the DOJ.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.820
If he left something here,

42:34.853 --> 42:35.854
I want it found!
