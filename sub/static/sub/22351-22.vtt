00:01.990 --> 00:08.989
Previously on "Big Brother":
>> Johnny Mac saw Vanessa as a

00:08.990 --> 00:08.991
threat.

00:08.991 --> 00:11.699
I feel like Vanessa is in
Shelli's head.

00:11.700 --> 00:14.989
I'm on to her and I want to put
a stop to it.

00:14.990 --> 00:18.989
When word got back to her...
>> you're in Shelli's head.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.289
You are going after Johnny Mac.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.989
All hell broke loose.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.829
You think I'm gunning for
you, based on what?

00:25.830 --> 00:29.989
Making Vanessa a bigger
target.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.989
I'm so honestly confused.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.699
Vanessa is a very smart
player but she is a loose

00:35.700 --> 00:35.990
Cannon.

00:35.991 --> 00:40.989
Her emotions can go from zero to
80 in less than a second.

00:40.990 --> 00:45.989
After Shelli's boy-toy was
sent back to Texas...

00:45.990 --> 00:49.989
Clay, you are evicted from
the "Big Brother" house...

00:49.990 --> 00:52.989
a greasy battle for power
began in California.

00:52.990 --> 00:58.829
And the Colorado girl raced her
way to the winner's circle.

00:58.830 --> 01:02.989
Congratulations, Becky, you
are the new head of household.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.989
Jackie, Meg, and James are
the people I trust more in the

01:05.990 --> 01:06.830
house.

01:06.831 --> 01:07.989
Becky set hersitis on
Vanessa.

01:07.990 --> 01:11.989
She's pissed enough people
off.

01:11.990 --> 01:12.990
That's why she's so paranoid.

01:12.991 --> 01:14.699
That's why she's so stressed.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.989
So she came up with a plan.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.989
We're going to put up Shelli
and Steve but it's going to be

01:19.990 --> 01:24.989
vaness.

01:24.990 --> 01:26.989
Becky left Vanessa clueless.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.289
It makes more sense for me to
put Shelli up next to Steve, and

01:30.290 --> 01:34.949
if one of those wins the veto,
put Johnny Mac up.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.989
And then refused a poker
player's deal.

01:36.990 --> 01:41.119
Would like to make a deal you
and I, but I would offer in

01:41.120 --> 01:42.829
return...
>> I'm done with deals.

01:42.830 --> 01:43.290
Oh, you are.

01:43.291 --> 01:44.989
I'm done with deals and
alliances.

01:44.990 --> 01:46.989
Croapt to hear those words again
in my life.

01:46.990 --> 01:47.540
Really?

01:47.541 --> 01:51.989
At the nomination ceremony,
Becky initiated phase one of her

01:51.990 --> 01:51.991
plan.

01:51.991 --> 01:54.989
I've nominated you, Shelli,
and you, Steve.

01:54.990 --> 02:00.989
Tonight, the veto is up for
grabs as "b. B. Comics" returns.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.989
Plus will Becky go through with
taking out Vanessa?

02:03.990 --> 02:06.989
All this right now on "big
brother."

02:06.990 --> 02:08.990
I'm not sure what this is.

02:47.290 --> 02:55.290
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

02:55.990 --> 02:58.989
I just put up Shelly and Steve
on to the block, and Vanessa

02:58.990 --> 03:02.989
hinks I that Shelli is my target
and if the power of veto were to

03:02.990 --> 03:03.990
be used John would be hitting
the block.

03:03.991 --> 03:06.989
But I have different ideas.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.539
I want to make sure Vanessa goes
home this week.

03:08.540 --> 03:10.989
I'm feeling really
uncomfortable with my position

03:10.990 --> 03:11.990
in this house.

03:11.991 --> 03:15.989
Becky and I do not get along on
a strategic level.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.989
She keeps putting me up.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.989
Becky, I don't know what your
problem sput there would be

03:20.990 --> 03:23.989
nothing more gratifying at this
point to win the veto and make

03:23.990 --> 03:26.989
sure you're my target next week.

03:26.990 --> 03:30.989
Right after Becky became
h.O.H., I go up and try to make

03:30.990 --> 03:33.989
a deal with her about recipical
safety.

03:33.990 --> 03:35.989
She wouldn't accept my deal.

03:35.990 --> 03:38.989
This totally stressed me out
because it made me think she was

03:38.990 --> 03:40.989
reserving me as a backdoor
option.

03:40.990 --> 03:41.990
Shelli.

03:41.990 --> 03:42.990
Let's go upstairs.

03:42.991 --> 03:45.829
The 6th sense is in trouble.

03:45.830 --> 03:49.989
First we lost Clay, now I'm on
the block, Vanessa is the

03:49.990 --> 03:49.991
backdoor plan.

03:49.991 --> 03:52.989
It's like we just keep getting
fired off one by one.

03:52.990 --> 03:56.989
Now it is just me, I am by
myself and I am guns ablation

03:56.990 --> 03:58.989
pup are all not going to get me
out this easy.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.989
How's it going?

04:00.990 --> 04:04.989
Awns, you constantly are
hoping the plan stays the same.

04:04.990 --> 04:09.539
I'm going after v.A.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.999
After Vanessa.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.289
I think she is an independent
that looks after her own game.

04:13.290 --> 04:14.989
Oh, my God.

04:14.990 --> 04:16.989
I want the blood to be solely
on me.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.989
This is my personal decision.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.989
This is my game, and you can act
like you have zero clue.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.989
Trust me, I'm happy to stay
away from it.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.989
Give me a hug.

04:28.990 --> 04:33.990
Get me through this week.

04:40.990 --> 04:48.990
♪ ♪ ♪
>> I think Becky's speech was

04:49.990 --> 04:50.990
accurate.

04:50.991 --> 04:54.989
I think every word that came out
of her mouth was completely

04:54.990 --> 04:59.989
correct.

04:59.990 --> 05:03.989
I've been saying this for
weeks... I want to get rid of

05:03.990 --> 05:11.990
Becky.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.989
Is everything okay?

05:25.990 --> 05:28.989
I don't trust anyone else in
this game.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.989
Every other ( Bleep ) In this
place just flip-flops and turns.

05:31.990 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.001 --> 05:34.989
There's something that makes
me think I'm actually the

05:34.990 --> 05:34.991
target.

05:34.991 --> 05:35.990
I'm telling you.

05:35.991 --> 05:37.539
I'm in an awkward position
right now.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.989
I would love to look out for
vaness and let her know she's

05:40.990 --> 05:44.989
the target this week, but I'm
the one on the block so I really

05:44.990 --> 05:51.699
need to be careful to look out
for my own game right now.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.989
I'm praying to get picked so I
can't get backdoored.

05:54.990 --> 05:56.539
And I will take you down.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.989
In fact, if it gets down to us
two, you should let me win.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.989
I'll put my hand on a Bible I
will take you down.

06:02.990 --> 06:05.989
But that way, I can't get
backdoored.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.409
But that's, like, best-case
scenario.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.989
I'm crossing my fingers I get
picked.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.989
If I get houseguest choice,
it would make sense to pick you.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
Duh.

06:16.991 --> 06:22.699
Please, pick me.

My throat's been bothering me a

I'm worried I could be a
backdoor target this week.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.989
I already talked to Shelly and
she's going to pick me to be in

07:44.990 --> 07:48.989
the veto competition if she get
houseguest choice and now I'm

07:48.990 --> 07:51.289
talking to Steve if he will give

07:51.290 --> 07:52.290
I want to ask you a favor.

07:52.290 --> 07:52.990
Okay.

07:52.991 --> 07:58.989
I've thought it through, and
I would like to you pick me for

07:58.990 --> 07:58.991
houseguest choice.

07:58.991 --> 08:00.989
If you do, I will gun for it.

08:00.990 --> 08:04.989
First of all, I want to win
because I'm nervous be being

08:04.990 --> 08:07.829
backdoored and I will take you
down down.

08:07.830 --> 08:10.989
I even told Shelli if Steve
picks me as houseguest choice...

08:10.990 --> 08:13.989
but if she picks you, you are
saving her.

08:13.990 --> 08:13.991
Yes.

08:13.991 --> 08:14.990
The same thing.

08:14.991 --> 08:16.699
She understands.

08:16.700 --> 08:16.990
Do you understand?

08:16.991 --> 08:18.989
I do.

08:18.990 --> 08:24.990
Thank you.

08:32.990 --> 08:33.990
What's going on?

08:33.991 --> 08:37.989
You slept all day.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.949
I'm just bored.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.989
Once we pick players there will
be some scampering.

08:42.990 --> 08:46.989
Did Becky tell you what the plan
is?

08:46.990 --> 08:51.989
Iis the the plan really to
backdoor her this week?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.989
I believe so.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.539
But we can't let anyone know
that we know.

08:56.540 --> 08:57.699
Of course, not.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.989
I've worked a lot with Shelli
and Clay in the past, and after

09:00.990 --> 09:03.989
the fight last week, I want to
make sure I'm still close with

09:03.990 --> 09:06.989
shell because I really don't
have a whole lot of allies in

09:06.990 --> 09:07.290
here.

09:07.291 --> 09:10.699
I have to do everything in my
power to make sure Vanessa does

09:10.700 --> 09:13.989
not play in this veto
competition so we can send her

09:13.990 --> 09:14.990
home.

09:14.991 --> 09:18.989
Fipull houseguest choice,
though, for veto, what am I

09:18.990 --> 09:19.700
supposed to do?

09:19.701 --> 09:24.989
Do I not pick you for veto or do
I?

09:24.990 --> 09:24.991
I think you should.

09:24.991 --> 09:28.989
She would think something was
up if I didn't call her.

09:28.990 --> 09:28.991
Right.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.989
I hope I just pick your name.

09:30.990 --> 09:32.289
I will veto you.

09:32.290 --> 09:33.989
Thank you.

09:33.990 --> 09:38.989
If Steve wins the veto and
Vanessa goes up against me, I'm

09:38.990 --> 09:39.990
going to be scared to death.

09:39.991 --> 09:41.989
Yeah.

09:41.990 --> 09:44.989
I'll tell Steve right now, I'll
veto you.

09:44.990 --> 09:47.999
I have always felt good about
Johnny in this game.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.989
He's thrown battles of the block
for me.

09:51.990 --> 09:53.989
He has been there for me and
Clay.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.989
Now that Clay is gone, I
definitely want to lean on

09:56.990 --> 09:57.990
Johnny Mac.

09:57.991 --> 09:59.989
I really need him in this game.

09:59.990 --> 10:07.990
I'm with you totally.

10:13.990 --> 10:19.989
We can cut it off sooner.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.989
I've only been able to figure
everything out based on

10:22.990 --> 10:26.409
information that I have been
getting from Becky.

10:26.410 --> 10:27.699
You don't know that.

10:27.700 --> 10:27.990
Right.

10:27.991 --> 10:31.539
Okay.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.989
Basically, they're on to
Vanessa.

10:34.990 --> 10:36.989
And they will send her home.

10:36.990 --> 10:40.989
Vanessa's the backdoor.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.989
> That's plan.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.119
And that's why you need to pick
me.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.989
We have to win veto tomorrow.

10:46.990 --> 10:51.409
When Johnny Mac tells me
Vanessa is the target my heart

10:51.410 --> 10:51.990
just dropped.

10:51.991 --> 10:54.989
I want to tell Vanessa, but
since I'm on the block I can

10:54.990 --> 10:57.989
only be taking the target off of
her and putting it on to me.

10:57.990 --> 11:03.989
Vanessa toll told me she
would save me fipicked her.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.409
If you win you're using it on
me?

11:05.410 --> 11:05.990
No.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.409
You're not going to save me?

11:07.410 --> 11:15.410
Right.

11:20.120 --> 11:24.989
you think I'm safe?

11:24.990 --> 11:25.990
Why?

11:25.991 --> 11:28.989
Steve, you haven't won
anything.

11:28.990 --> 11:34.989
Steve has these ideas built up
in his head that he's an amazing

11:34.990 --> 11:36.989
supergamer that everyone wants
out of the house and that's just

11:36.990 --> 11:37.990
not the way it is.

11:37.991 --> 11:43.989
Like, no ona coming after you,
dude.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.999
Shelli and me are on our own.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.989
I like working with you guys.

11:47.990 --> 11:51.409
I'm really trusting you with a
lot of ( Bleep ), man.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.409
I'm trusting you, too.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.829
This is a lot of...
>> I know.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.989
If we pull this off this
week, we have the smartest

11:58.990 --> 11:59.990
person out of the game.

11:59.990 --> 12:00.990
She is good.

12:00.990 --> 12:01.290
Vanessa?

12:01.291 --> 12:02.989
She's good.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.989
This is ( Bleep ) War.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.989
We're in the middle of it.

12:07.990 --> 12:10.409
Maybe I'll go to bed.

12:10.410 --> 12:14.990
Okay.

12:50.990 --> 12:55.989
So?

12:55.990 --> 12:58.949
We're the last showmance
standing.

12:58.950 --> 12:59.989
I know.

12:59.990 --> 13:03.989
It's a serious thing.

13:03.990 --> 13:07.989
So at first me and Austin's
relationship was more strategy

13:07.990 --> 13:12.829
for me, but as I've gotten to
know him, it's grown into a

13:12.830 --> 13:14.409
little bit more than that.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.410
Rub my tummy.

13:15.411 --> 13:21.829
I usually go for the typical
Miami muscle head model kind of

13:21.830 --> 13:21.990
guy.

13:21.991 --> 13:25.989
But his personality has won me
over and maybe one day I can get

13:25.990 --> 13:28.989
him to chop off his ponytail
beard.

13:28.990 --> 13:31.999
You have, like, the magic
touch.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.950
I do?

13:32.951 --> 13:33.989
You do.

13:33.990 --> 13:36.989
I love it.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.999
Your hands are so cute.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.989
Get off of her, Austin!

13:44.990 --> 13:46.999
Bleh!

13:47.000 --> 13:54.989
Hey, everybody, it's time to
pick players for the veto

13:54.990 --> 13:57.539
competition.

13:57.540 --> 14:03.539
Only six people will participate
in the veto compitition, the

14:03.540 --> 14:07.949
head of household, two nominees,
and three other players selected

14:07.950 --> 14:08.120
by random draw.

14:08.121 --> 14:11.989
Will the two nominees please
join me up here?

14:11.990 --> 14:15.989
I am praying that Vanessa's name
is not drawn for this veto

14:15.990 --> 14:15.991
competition.

14:15.991 --> 14:22.829
As h.O.H., I will pick first.

14:22.830 --> 14:23.989
Austin.

14:23.990 --> 14:31.990
( Applause )
>> Houseguest choice.

14:38.990 --> 14:46.989
Oh, crap.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.829
Vanessa ( Applause )

14:48.830 --> 14:53.989
I hope I don't upset John and
Becky by choosing Vanessa for

14:53.990 --> 14:57.989
houseguest choice but I had to
go with my gut and I picked

14:57.990 --> 14:58.120
Vanessa.

14:58.121 --> 15:00.989
Shelli picks Vanessa and I'm
freaking out!

15:00.990 --> 15:02.989
I'm like what are you doing?

15:02.990 --> 15:06.989
You're going to mess up this
whole plan!

15:06.990 --> 15:10.409
Meg.

15:10.410 --> 15:10.990
( Applause ).

15:10.991 --> 15:12.989
I'm really excited to play.

15:12.990 --> 15:16.989
This New York girl is ready to
rock this veto and backdoor

15:16.990 --> 15:19.119
Vanessa.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.989
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

15:22.990 --> 15:23.700
begin.

15:23.700 --> 15:23.990
Good luck.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.409
<i>( Applause ) </i>>> This is great.

15:26.410 --> 15:29.989
Now I have a chance not only to
play for my own safety from

15:29.990 --> 15:32.989
being a backdoor option, but I
also have the possibility of

15:32.990 --> 15:40.990
taking Shelli off the block.

15:45.990 --> 15:47.989
This doesn't look good.

15:47.990 --> 15:48.990
What the ( Bleep )?

15:48.991 --> 15:54.949
What did Shelli...
>> I have no crd.

15:54.950 --> 15:58.989
John's really upset that Shelli
picked Vanessa and, frankly, so

15:58.990 --> 16:03.989
am I, because I know if Vanessa
wins the veto by her promise she

16:03.990 --> 16:05.989
will have to save Shelli now.

16:05.990 --> 16:09.989
You told her you would use it on
her.

16:09.990 --> 16:14.989
If Vanessa wins, she'll take
Shelli off.

16:14.990 --> 16:15.290
That's bad.

16:15.291 --> 16:18.989
Yeah.

16:18.990 --> 16:22.829
John.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.949
I had no idea what to do.

16:24.950 --> 16:28.699
If I didn't pick her, she would
be blowing up right now.

16:28.700 --> 16:28.990
Yeah.

16:28.991 --> 16:33.289
That's the last chippented to
pick.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.000
I didn't know what to do.

16:34.001 --> 16:35.989
I get it.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.989
Yeah, it would be bad if Vanessa
knew there was a plan going on,

16:38.990 --> 16:41.699
but at the same time, Shelli, if
you picked me, Vanessa would not

16:41.700 --> 16:43.989
have a chance to save herself
and it wouldn't matter.

16:43.990 --> 16:46.989
I was, like, praying I
wouldn't pick that one.

16:46.990 --> 16:48.989
I'm so sorry.

16:48.990 --> 16:49.990
Yup.

16:49.990 --> 16:50.990
Win it, please.

16:50.990 --> 16:51.830
I know.

16:51.830 --> 16:52.700
I know.

16:52.701 --> 16:53.989
That's only option.

16:53.990 --> 16:59.699
John looks pretty unhappy they
didn't choose him for the veto

16:59.700 --> 17:01.989
competition but I don't have
Clay with me in this game

17:01.990 --> 17:04.989
anymore and Vanessa is my
closest Ally in the house.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.989
She is somebody who will fight
for this veto and if she wins

17:07.990 --> 17:09.989
it, she will take me off the
block.

17:09.990 --> 17:11.989
This is the best chance for me
to save myself.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.990
Don't let her win it.

17:33.990 --> 17:41.990
Yeah, okay, yeah.

17:43.990 --> 17:44.990
James!

17:44.990 --> 17:45.990
I hate you!

17:45.990 --> 17:46.990
I'm sorry.

17:46.991 --> 17:48.989
Who was it?

17:48.990 --> 17:49.990
Was it evacuate?

17:49.990 --> 17:49.991
Yeah.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.999
Oh, my God!

17:52.000 --> 17:58.989
Meg, I wish it was you!

17:58.990 --> 18:00.989
Hey, everyone!

18:00.990 --> 18:02.539
It's time for the veto
competition!

18:02.540 --> 18:03.699
Please gather in the living
room.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.989
You'll be playing one at a time,
so everyone wait for "big

18:05.990 --> 18:08.829
brother" to call you out into
the backyard.

18:08.830 --> 18:08.990
Good luck.

18:08.991 --> 18:10.989
Oh!

18:10.990 --> 18:18.990
( Applause ) >> Cool.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.989
I'm so on board with Becky's
plan this week.

18:22.990 --> 18:24.949
I know that I need to win.

18:24.950 --> 18:29.989
We need to get one of our pawns
off of the block, and make sure

18:29.990 --> 18:34.829
that Vanessa doesn't win this
one so we can backdoor her.

18:34.830 --> 18:39.989
B.B. Comics is about to release
17 new super heroes but the

18:39.990 --> 18:43.989
world can't wait so it's your
job to get the scoop on who they

18:43.989 --> 18:44.989
Here's how the game works.

18:44.990 --> 18:49.989
Hit the button to start your
clock, then fly down the zip

18:49.990 --> 18:51.989
line to peek inside the b.B.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.119
Comic studios.

18:53.120 --> 18:59.699
Grab the comic books and place
them so it matches the b.B.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.290
Studio wall.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.989
Each comic has a decoy.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.989
When you think you have all 17
correct, hit your button.

19:04.990 --> 19:07.989
If incorrect, a buzzer will
sound.

19:07.990 --> 19:11.989
Your clock will keep running and
you must figure out what is

19:11.990 --> 19:11.991
wrong.

19:11.991 --> 19:13.999
The player who matches the b.B.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.989
Comic studio wall in the
shortest amount of time will win

19:16.990 --> 19:17.830
power of veto.

19:17.831 --> 19:19.989
Are you ready to play b.B.

19:19.990 --> 19:19.991
Comics?

19:19.991 --> 19:25.949
Yes, I am!

19:25.950 --> 19:27.989
I've never used a zip line
before in my life.

19:27.990 --> 19:31.989
In this competition, we have to
memorize the order of comic book

19:31.990 --> 19:34.989
covers in the window and
replicate the order on our

19:34.990 --> 19:34.991
computer.

19:34.991 --> 19:41.989
The player who does this in the
shortest time wins.

19:41.990 --> 19:42.990
I'm terrifying looking!

19:42.991 --> 19:45.989
I love the big apple.

19:45.990 --> 19:50.949
My crazy-looking monster face.

19:50.950 --> 19:50.990
Aarrgghh!

19:50.990 --> 19:50.991
Oh, there's two of me.

19:50.991 --> 19:53.989
Of course, there's two of
everything.

19:53.990 --> 19:57.539
Looking at the two posters up
close, they look exactly the

19:57.540 --> 20:02.699
same which means these changes
are super subtle details and you

20:02.700 --> 20:06.949
really have to pay close
attention.

20:06.950 --> 20:10.989
James' poster has a belt buckle
or no belt buckle.

20:10.990 --> 20:13.949
Jason is holding a hose or
sausage.

20:13.950 --> 20:13.990
The blanket!

20:13.991 --> 20:14.999
Oh, my God, I'm dying.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.409
I see the blankets.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.999
Would be serrified of that
superhero.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.989
I mean, evidence terrified of
Audrey.

20:22.990 --> 20:25.989
Audrey spent her last few days
here covered in a blanket and

20:25.990 --> 20:27.989
sunglasses.

20:27.990 --> 20:28.990
Okay.

20:28.991 --> 20:34.989
First, I want to put everyone in
order.

20:34.990 --> 20:37.989
Mister perfection, you in the
middle.

20:37.990 --> 20:39.539
Mama day, you're on the end.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.829
Who am I missing?

20:41.830 --> 20:44.989
Then I went back to the zip
line, figuring out which comic

20:44.990 --> 20:46.989
book cover was the right one.

20:46.990 --> 20:53.829
Iel oh, salesman, super show
girl.

20:53.830 --> 20:58.989
I'm feeling like I'm on a roll,
but then I start noticing a

20:58.990 --> 21:06.990
couple of hard details, like the
twins.

21:10.540 --> 21:10.990
Bikini.

21:10.991 --> 21:12.989
Come on!

21:12.990 --> 21:19.989
( Buzzer )
Austin's what's yours?

21:19.990 --> 21:21.539
Sword color.

21:21.540 --> 21:25.539
Silver.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.989
Vegas sign.

21:28.990 --> 21:28.991
Buzzer.

21:28.991 --> 21:30.539
Are you serious?

21:30.540 --> 21:35.989
I am sitting here staring at
pretty boy's face, and I cannot

21:35.990 --> 21:39.989
figure out what the difference
is.

21:39.990 --> 21:43.989
Clay, what's different about you
in that?

21:43.990 --> 21:47.289
It's his hot pants.

21:47.290 --> 21:47.990
Red.

21:47.991 --> 21:53.989
Once I figure out what the color
is wrong, I race to the the

21:53.990 --> 21:59.989
buzzer.

21:59.990 --> 21:59.991
Oh!

21:59.991 --> 22:02.989
The stakes are so high in
this competition.

22:02.990 --> 22:06.989
Vanessa's playing in it, and
she's my backdoor.

22:06.990 --> 22:09.989
If she were to win and take down
Shelli, both my targets are off

22:09.990 --> 22:13.119
the block, and I'm not in a good
place here in the house.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.999
My strategy is to identify all
the men on the zip line wall,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.989
and then lay their posters out
to find the differences.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.989
If I can get the men done first,
I can then quickly do the women.

22:23.990 --> 22:26.989
The difference is... what's the
difference?

22:26.990 --> 22:28.989
Sausage.

22:28.990 --> 22:30.989
Belt buckle.

22:30.990 --> 22:30.991
Sausage.

22:30.991 --> 22:32.539
Belt buckle.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.540
It is tough.

22:33.541 --> 22:36.949
I am looking at some of these
posters and swearing that

22:36.950 --> 22:44.950
there's no difference amongst
the two.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.989
I love my comic book cover.

22:48.990 --> 22:51.989
The tragedy in my life is what
has made meet strong woman that

22:51.990 --> 22:53.989
I am to date.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.699
Kind of poetic in a way.

22:55.700 --> 22:59.989
It's kind of like hilary swank
meets ironman fighting a train.

22:59.990 --> 23:06.989
It's perfect.

23:06.990 --> 23:07.290
Okay.

23:07.291 --> 23:10.989
( Buzzer ) Are you serious?

23:10.990 --> 23:12.989
I have no idea what the
difference is.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.989
I honestly think I'm going to
get timed out.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.989
What the heck is the difference?

23:17.990 --> 23:19.989
What am I missing?

23:19.990 --> 23:21.289
Oh, my gosh, the sword.

23:21.290 --> 23:24.989
The sword is different.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.989
Brown sword-silver sword.

23:26.990 --> 23:27.990
Silver.

23:27.991 --> 23:34.539
( Bell rings )
Oh, that's horrible.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.989
Becky has let me know that
I'm not the target this week but

23:36.990 --> 23:44.989
I have got to win this veto to
make sure I save myself.

23:44.990 --> 23:48.999
My strategy going into this
competition is to memorize four

23:49.000 --> 23:52.989
comics at a time and then put
those four up on my computer

23:52.990 --> 23:53.990
screen in order.

23:53.990 --> 23:54.990
I'm the puma.

23:54.991 --> 24:00.699
How about we just rub it in a
little bit more that I'm 10

24:00.700 --> 24:02.989
years old than Mr. perfection.

24:02.990 --> 24:03.990
I'm okay with that.

24:03.991 --> 24:05.989
Puma's are cute.

24:05.990 --> 24:09.989
In real life, my superpower is
attention to detail.

24:09.990 --> 24:15.289
This is a competition that I'm
going to be fantastic at!

24:15.290 --> 24:18.989
( Buzzer ) What?

24:18.990 --> 24:19.000
Damn it!

24:19.001 --> 24:25.119
I don't know what's wrong?

24:25.120 --> 24:31.989
( Buzzer ) What's wrong?

24:31.990 --> 24:33.989
I know I've got this order
right.

24:33.990 --> 24:34.990
What am I missing?

24:34.991 --> 24:36.989
Oh, my God.

24:36.990 --> 24:39.999
My strategy was just to look at
the order and I wasn't looking

24:40.000 --> 24:41.539
at the differences.

24:41.540 --> 24:49.540
I am way behind.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.539
( Buzzer )
I'm tired of hearing that!

24:54.540 --> 25:01.989
This sucks!

25:01.990 --> 25:02.410
Dude!

25:02.411 --> 25:03.989
Your short aren't black.

25:03.990 --> 25:09.949
They're the color of Texas a &m.

25:09.950 --> 25:11.989
You're messing me up.

25:11.990 --> 25:19.990
( Bell ring persons
.My strategy in this competition

25:21.990 --> 25:26.829
is utilize my athleticism and
try to move through this pretty

25:26.830 --> 25:26.990
quickly.

25:26.991 --> 25:28.989
This is trickier than I thought.

25:28.990 --> 25:34.989
My comic book character is
Austin the ba barbarian.

25:34.990 --> 25:35.990
I love it.

25:35.991 --> 25:40.989
Except for the fact it says
something about me having a an

25:40.990 --> 25:40.991
odor.

25:40.991 --> 25:42.989
I shower after every workout.

25:42.990 --> 25:46.989
I'm sleeping with Liz next to me
every night.

25:46.990 --> 25:50.989
She's never said anything.

25:50.990 --> 25:58.119
Jace's comic book character,
bros before pros.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.989
I'm glad he got back in the mix.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.989
I forgot what he looked like.

26:04.990 --> 26:07.989
Sorry, Jace.

26:07.990 --> 26:09.699
I'm starting to get out of
breath here.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.989
I work out all the time in this
house.

26:11.990 --> 26:12.990
I'm in great shape.

26:12.991 --> 26:14.989
I'm a professional wrestler.

26:14.990 --> 26:21.119
Now I'm flopping around like a
dead fish out there.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.999
( Buzzer )
I'm looking at this poster of

26:24.000 --> 26:27.989
Liz, and all I can think about
is biking through the vineyard

26:27.990 --> 26:33.989
on a tandem bike with her, maybe
a romantic stroll on the beach

26:33.990 --> 26:35.989
or just kissing her.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.989
Austin, focus!

26:38.990 --> 26:46.989
( Bell rings )
>> I want to win this veto

26:46.990 --> 26:49.829
competition pause you never know
what's going on in the the house

26:49.830 --> 26:50.989
when you're on the block.

26:50.990 --> 26:53.989
Johnny is telling me I'm safe
but not Becky.

26:53.990 --> 26:57.999
Had you don't know what's going
on, I don't want to risk staying

26:58.000 --> 26:58.990
on the block.

26:58.991 --> 27:00.409
Jason and Meg and James.

27:00.410 --> 27:04.949
My plan going into this is I'm
going to get all the right

27:04.950 --> 27:07.989
people in the right places and
ignore the details that are

27:07.990 --> 27:09.989
different for the same people.

27:09.990 --> 27:10.990
John, Vanessa, Austin.

27:10.991 --> 27:15.989
Once I figure out where everyone
goes, I'm going to look for the

27:15.990 --> 27:23.989
differences and pick the right
person.

27:23.990 --> 27:31.990
There are two of each.

27:32.990 --> 27:33.990
Sausages versus rope.

27:33.991 --> 27:35.119
And Meg's hat.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.699
I'm picking out what the
differences is.

27:37.700 --> 27:41.829
When I figure out what a couple
of them, I'm going back on the

27:41.830 --> 27:44.289
zip line, riding it out, and
looking exactly at that

27:44.290 --> 27:47.989
difference and nothing else and
figuring out which version is

27:47.990 --> 27:47.991
correct.

27:47.991 --> 27:48.990
Oh, his pants.

27:48.991 --> 27:56.991
Pink rockets.

27:57.990 --> 27:59.989
Mountain, Mountain.

27:59.990 --> 27:59.991
Mountain.

27:59.991 --> 28:00.990
Think in the back.

28:00.990 --> 28:01.990
Guard, guard, guard.

28:01.991 --> 28:05.989
I'm staring at Becky's two
comics and I can't figure out

28:05.990 --> 28:08.989
which one is real, which is the
decoy and which is fake.

28:08.990 --> 28:11.989
If I can't figure out the
difference, I can't figure on

28:11.990 --> 28:13.989
the which one is right.

28:13.990 --> 28:14.990
What is different?

28:14.990 --> 28:15.990
I don't see it.

28:15.991 --> 28:20.989
Becky I am so sick of you
screwing me over on this game!

28:20.990 --> 28:22.989
When will you let me go.

28:22.990 --> 28:23.999
Oh, the thing on her chest.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.989
I am a dumb ass.

28:26.990 --> 28:30.829
( Bell ringing )
I'm raelg not feeling too good

28:30.830 --> 28:30.990
about my time.

28:30.991 --> 28:34.409
I spent a lot of time trying to
figure out some of the

28:34.410 --> 28:37.289
differences and I know some of
the my trips on the zip line

28:37.290 --> 28:41.989
could have been more efficient
than they were.

28:41.990 --> 28:45.539
I know that there is this
plan to put Johnny Mac up as a

28:45.540 --> 28:49.989
replacement nominee, but I'm
very nervous Becky won't be

28:49.990 --> 28:52.989
willing to do that out of
loyalty to him and her only

28:52.990 --> 28:57.989
other alternative is me, so to
protect myself I need to win

28:57.990 --> 28:59.989
this thing.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.989
My strategy coming in is simple.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.989
The first part is, I want to get
order down.

29:05.990 --> 29:09.989
This is exact let's competition
I've been waiting for.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.989
It involves memory, and so I get
the order right, and then it's

29:12.990 --> 29:16.989
time to look at each individual
comic book and compare it to the

29:16.990 --> 29:18.989
one pnd it to find difference.

29:18.990 --> 29:18.991
Sure, sure.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.989
And move along.

29:20.990 --> 29:28.990
( Buzzer )
The buzzer keeps going off, so

29:29.120 --> 29:36.989
I'm just going to have to
recheck them all one at a time.

29:36.990 --> 29:41.989
Blanket is written in pink.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.989
Tail on puma.

29:44.990 --> 29:50.119
Shoot.

29:50.120 --> 29:54.949
( Bell rings )
Today was like my comp.

29:54.950 --> 29:55.989
I had a great strategy.

29:55.990 --> 29:56.990
I knew what to do.

29:56.991 --> 30:00.989
I'm praying I win the veto so I
can save my own butt from being

30:00.990 --> 30:04.989
a backdoor target and
potentially give Shelli a shot

30:04.990 --> 30:05.990
to survive the week.

30:18.990 --> 30:21.989
Backyard, and I notice all of
these comic book covers with our

30:21.990 --> 30:26.989
faces on it.

30:26.990 --> 30:31.989
I will gladly take the evil twin
because I'm a little evil.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.989
Oh, look at Audrey!

30:33.990 --> 30:35.989
I see Audrey's comic book cover.

30:35.990 --> 30:38.989
I was actually kind of scared of
that comic.

30:38.990 --> 30:41.989
I wouldn't want to read that
one.

30:41.990 --> 30:43.289
"The blanket."

30:43.290 --> 30:45.949
She's going under cover.

30:45.950 --> 30:51.999
I don't know if captain cameo
can take on the blanket, but he

30:52.000 --> 30:54.989
would go out trying to do his
pest.

30:54.990 --> 30:56.989
Let's see how everybody did.

30:56.990 --> 31:00.989
Meg, you finished in 15 minutes
and 37 seconds.

31:00.990 --> 31:04.989
Are you in the lead.

31:04.990 --> 31:05.990
Becky.

31:05.991 --> 31:08.539
17 minutes and two seconds.

31:08.540 --> 31:13.699
My score was 17:02, and I
instantly start sweating.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.409
If Vanessa were to win this
competition, it would be

31:15.410 --> 31:17.989
horrible for me.

31:17.990 --> 31:17.991
Shelli.

31:17.991 --> 31:21.949
25 minutes and 31 seconds.

31:21.950 --> 31:21.990
( Applause ).

31:21.991 --> 31:25.989
I had no strategy.

31:25.990 --> 31:28.989
Austin, your time is.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.989
21 minutes and 20 seconds.

31:30.990 --> 31:31.990
<i>( Applause ).</i>

31:31.991 --> 31:33.989
Reporter, Austin.

31:33.990 --> 31:37.989
All right, Steve, let's see
if you can beat Meg's time of

31:37.990 --> 31:40.989
15:37.

31:40.990 --> 31:46.989
Steve, your time is 13 minutes
and 57 seconds.

31:46.990 --> 31:47.990
( Cheers and applause ).

31:47.990 --> 31:48.990
Stevie!

31:48.991 --> 31:51.989
Steve, you are currently in
the lead.

31:51.990 --> 31:52.990
All right.

31:52.991 --> 31:54.989
It all comes down to this.

31:54.990 --> 31:58.989
Let's see if Vanessa can beat
Steve's time of 13 minutes and

31:58.990 --> 32:00.989
57 seconds.

32:00.990 --> 32:05.989
So I'm in the lead but
there's one person left,

32:05.990 --> 32:05.991
Vanessa.

32:05.991 --> 32:09.289
If she wins I'm screwed, but if
I win I'm safe.

32:09.290 --> 32:12.989
This is going to end either
really well or really poorly.

32:12.990 --> 32:20.989
All right, Vanessa, your time
was... 21 minutes and 44

32:20.990 --> 32:21.540
seconds.

32:21.541 --> 32:24.989
<i>( Applause )
</i>That means, Steve, you have won

32:24.990 --> 32:26.989
the golden power of veto.

32:26.990 --> 32:29.989
I won the power of veto.

32:29.990 --> 32:33.539
I'm safe for another week and I
I'm so happy I can sit back,

32:33.540 --> 32:36.119
relax, and think about what's
going on and not stress this

32:36.120 --> 32:36.990
week.

32:36.991 --> 32:38.989
Steve wins and I'm ecstatic.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.989
This is best-case scenario for
me.

32:41.990 --> 32:44.989
I don't have to do any dirty
work by using the veto and I get

32:44.990 --> 32:47.989
to put Vanessa on block this
week.

32:47.990 --> 32:50.699
I thought it would be a
totally different comic.

32:50.700 --> 32:51.989
I'm still on the block.

32:51.990 --> 32:55.989
Hopefully the plan is still in
action to backdoor Vanessa,

32:55.990 --> 32:57.989
because I don't want things
changing and then I am the

32:57.990 --> 32:58.540
target.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.989
I had no idea how di.

33:00.990 --> 33:03.829
I just knew I got screwed up on
the end.

33:03.830 --> 33:04.540
I blew it.

33:04.541 --> 33:06.989
Now there's a spot open on the
block and someone needs to fill

33:06.990 --> 33:08.989
it and I'm really nervous it
might be me.

33:08.990 --> 33:12.989
If the option came down to
putting up either me or Johnny

33:12.990 --> 33:20.990
Mac, I just don't see her
putting Johnny Mac up.

33:21.990 --> 33:24.829
What are people doing?

33:24.830 --> 33:26.829
They're all out at the pool.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.289
Oh, boy.

33:29.290 --> 33:31.989
Has Becky said if she's sticking
to the plan?

33:31.990 --> 33:36.999
Ummmm... she's not, like,
really... I don't know, like, she

33:37.000 --> 33:39.539
hasn't really said anything else
about the the plan.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.989
We all gave our words.

33:41.990 --> 33:45.989
So I don't even know what kind
of discussion could possibly be

33:45.990 --> 33:45.991
had.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.989
Johnny Mac is not going home.

33:47.990 --> 33:49.989
Yeah?

33:49.990 --> 33:51.989
So it's like a no-risk play.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.119
Becky seems like she's a
straight shooter.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.989
But she hasn't said, "I'm
sticking to it?"

33:57.990 --> 34:00.989
I mean, she hasn't talked to
me about...

34:00.990 --> 34:03.989
don't ( Bleep ) Me.

34:03.990 --> 34:04.990
You're a straight shooter.

34:04.990 --> 34:05.990
I'm not.

34:05.990 --> 34:06.990
You're ( Bleep ) Right now.

34:06.990 --> 34:07.990
I can tell.

34:07.991 --> 34:09.409
I'm definitely not, Vanessa.

34:09.410 --> 34:10.120
James!

34:10.121 --> 34:11.989
I'm being serious.

34:11.990 --> 34:15.989
Oh, my God, this is the first
time you ( Bleep ) In this whole

34:15.990 --> 34:15.991
game.

34:15.991 --> 34:19.989
You have a guilty look on your
face right now.

34:19.990 --> 34:21.539
Look at that face.

34:21.540 --> 34:23.989
Does that look like...
>> it's a kitty hat.

34:23.990 --> 34:25.989
She has not talked to me about
the plan.

34:25.990 --> 34:29.989
The only plan she talked about
is the deal we came up with.

34:29.990 --> 34:32.989
As a correctional officer
we're trained to get out of

34:32.990 --> 34:35.989
tricky situations but Vanessa's
coming at me real hard.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.989
The only thing I need to do is
try to get out of that room

34:38.990 --> 34:39.950
asap.

34:39.951 --> 34:42.989
I will definitely talk to her
and, you know, it doesn't feel

34:42.990 --> 34:44.409
good obviously you know
something's going on.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.989
I really am trying to stay out
of everything this week.

34:46.990 --> 34:49.989
I don't want to be in there
pressing buttons and throwing

34:49.990 --> 34:51.119
names out and stuff like that.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.989
So...
>> I should go talk to Becky.

34:52.990 --> 34:57.999
Yeah.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.989
She was investigating me.

35:00.990 --> 35:08.990
Like, she's asking me all kinds
of questions.

35:09.990 --> 35:13.989
I just got out of the devil a
lair.

35:13.990 --> 35:16.989
Vanessa has a feeling she's
getting backdoored.

35:16.990 --> 35:21.989
How do you joon she was like,
"do you know anything?"

35:21.990 --> 35:25.989
I said, "I would definitely
probably talk to Becky."

35:25.990 --> 35:26.990
No!

35:26.990 --> 35:27.990
What?

35:27.990 --> 35:28.990
Come on!

35:28.990 --> 35:29.990
Evidence under fire!

35:29.991 --> 35:31.989
I was taking grenades.

35:31.990 --> 35:36.989
No, you should have said
that's why... that's crazy.

35:36.990 --> 35:38.989
You're not getting backdoored.

35:38.990 --> 35:46.990
Man!

35:48.990 --> 35:50.989
Why, hello!

35:50.990 --> 35:51.990
Hey.

35:51.991 --> 35:53.989
Do you have a minute to talk?

35:53.990 --> 35:55.989
Yeah, go ahead.

35:55.990 --> 35:56.990
Are you alone?

35:56.990 --> 35:57.950
Uh-huh.

35:57.951 --> 35:59.989
Are you enjoying wine?

35:59.990 --> 36:00.990
I am.

36:00.991 --> 36:02.989
I have had several glations.

36:02.990 --> 36:03.990
Oh, goodness, dwraishes.

36:03.991 --> 36:06.989
I hate bug you when you're
having a good time but I'm a

36:06.990 --> 36:08.989
little concerned for the
following reason.

36:08.990 --> 36:09.990
Look, I'm no dummy.

36:09.990 --> 36:10.990
Yeah.

36:10.991 --> 36:13.119
And I understand Johnny Mac
is a friend of yours.

36:13.120 --> 36:16.989
So I'm sure it's probably got to
be a tough spot for you and I

36:16.990 --> 36:21.989
know it would be bad game play
for you to go after Austin and

36:21.990 --> 36:24.949
the twins so you're not going to
do that and you're not going to

36:24.950 --> 36:26.989
look at the three people you're
work with which means it's

36:26.990 --> 36:28.289
between me and Johnny Mac.

36:28.290 --> 36:28.990
I'm no dummy.

36:28.990 --> 36:29.990
And I get it.

36:29.991 --> 36:34.989
The only thingented to remind
you of is I was in your spot and

36:34.990 --> 36:38.989
it would have been very easy for
me not to keep my word to you.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.989
I qot so much extra blood on my
hands to keep my word for you

36:41.990 --> 36:44.989
and I'm only asking for the same
in return.

36:44.990 --> 36:47.989
Do you know...
>> Vanessa thinks I owe her

36:47.990 --> 36:50.989
because she kept me in the game
and got Jason out.

36:50.990 --> 36:52.409
I don't owe her anything.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.989
If Shelli stays, she's going
to, I will guarantee you, if she

36:55.990 --> 36:58.989
wins h.O.H....
>> Vanessa, you were paranoid

36:58.990 --> 37:00.989
last week, too.

37:00.990 --> 37:03.989
You are paranoid every week.

37:03.990 --> 37:07.119
Each week you get scared, and
I'm always like, Vanessa, this

37:07.120 --> 37:08.989
is a game, Vanessa.

37:08.990 --> 37:11.409
So them what you're saying is
I'm not going up.

37:11.410 --> 37:11.990
No.

37:11.991 --> 37:13.999
But I'm still going to play
hard.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.999
I'm still going toa always make
my point...

37:16.000 --> 37:16.990
absolutely, absolutely.

37:16.991 --> 37:20.989
And this is why I think this
and this is why I think that.

37:20.990 --> 37:22.989
Those are the only tools I have.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.989
They're the only tools you have
in this game what comes out of

37:25.990 --> 37:29.989
your mouth so I'm going to make
my point and talk it out.

37:29.990 --> 37:32.989
Mwa, mwa, mwa.

37:32.990 --> 37:35.989
Please, Vanessa, your grave is
deep enough.

37:35.990 --> 37:37.989
I need to get some food.

37:37.990 --> 37:40.989
I'm hungry.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.989
What are we going to do
tomorrow?

37:43.990 --> 37:49.989
I don't know.

37:49.990 --> 37:50.990
( Laughing ).

37:50.991 --> 37:53.989
Hello, party people.

37:53.990 --> 37:54.990
What up?

37:54.990 --> 37:55.990
How are you guys doing.

37:55.990 --> 37:56.990
We're fine.

37:56.991 --> 37:58.829
We were just discussing
business.

37:58.830 --> 38:02.989
Yeah.

38:02.990 --> 38:06.409
So, you guys, I have a really
strong feeling based on what

38:06.410 --> 38:08.989
Becky says the plan's going to
go through as we talked about,

38:08.990 --> 38:10.989
which is really great news.

38:10.990 --> 38:12.989
Yeah, wait, why?

38:12.990 --> 38:13.000
Why wouldn't it?

38:13.001 --> 38:16.699
I just know... anyway, so you
just never know.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.989
I never know until...
>> yeah, you're right.

38:19.990 --> 38:20.950
There gu.

38:20.951 --> 38:23.989
And so I just want to say, like,
I'm on board to do something

38:23.990 --> 38:26.989
again if you guys want to do
something, like, make some kind

38:26.990 --> 38:27.990
of deal.

38:27.990 --> 38:27.991
Oh.

38:27.991 --> 38:28.990
I thought we did?

38:28.990 --> 38:29.990
So we're still going.

38:29.990 --> 38:30.990
I thought we did.

38:30.991 --> 38:32.289
So it's all the same thing.

38:32.290 --> 38:32.990
Yeah.

38:32.990 --> 38:33.990
Deal.

38:33.990 --> 38:34.290
Okay, good.

38:34.291 --> 38:35.989
I'm just a dumb-dumb.

38:35.990 --> 38:39.289
Becky and I speak two different
languages.

38:39.290 --> 38:41.989
I don't speak Becky, she doesn't
speak Vanessa.

38:41.990 --> 38:44.989
But we have this deal in common
right now.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.989
The good news is I'm going to be
here another week!

38:47.990 --> 38:51.699
All right, guys, so if you
were to go anywhere in the

38:51.700 --> 38:52.410
world, where would it be?

38:52.411 --> 39:00.411
I would go to...
girlfriend!

39:14.990 --> 39:16.071
Vanessa, you're going home!

40:08.990 --> 40:09.990
Hey, everyone.

40:09.991 --> 40:15.990
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:29.410 --> 40:30.989
This is the veto meeting.

40:30.990 --> 40:33.989
Shelli and I have been nominated
for eviction, but I have the

40:33.990 --> 40:36.989
power to veto one of those
nominations.

40:36.990 --> 40:41.999
I have decided to use the power
of veto on myself.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.989
Becky, since I have just vetoed
one of your nominations, you

40:45.990 --> 40:53.990
must now name a new houseguest
as a replacement nominee.

40:54.990 --> 41:02.289
All right, this has been a
personal decision for my game.

41:02.290 --> 41:10.290
Vanessa, please take a seat.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.119
Vanessa, in the house, I have
such a hard time knowing who

41:14.120 --> 41:16.989
you're with in this room and who
you're against.

41:16.990 --> 41:20.989
I feel that you're so
influential, and you can spin

41:20.990 --> 41:24.989
amazing deals, make plans,
influence h.O.H. Moves.

41:24.990 --> 41:28.989
But I have also observed when
people needed you most, you drop

41:28.990 --> 41:31.989
them like that ( Snaps fingers )

41:31.990 --> 41:34.989
If it did not benefit your game,
and this is the reason I feel

41:34.990 --> 41:42.990
you should be sitting on that
seat today.

41:45.000 --> 41:53.000
This power of veto meeting is
adjourned.

41:54.990 --> 41:58.989
I'm hurt because she gave her
word and she broke it.

41:58.990 --> 42:01.989
I thought she was a logical
person and not emotional, I

42:01.990 --> 42:05.989
mean, the way she just treated
me was downright disrespectful

42:05.990 --> 42:06.990
for no reason.

42:06.991 --> 42:09.989
Wan she wants to take it out and
target me personally she's doing

42:09.990 --> 42:12.989
it to the wrong person because I
still have plays to make.

42:12.990 --> 42:15.409
So by no means count me out.

42:15.410 --> 42:19.949
My plan has been working out
almost too good.

42:19.950 --> 42:20.950
Vanessa is on the block.

42:20.951 --> 42:22.989
Now I just have to make sure she
goes home.

42:22.990 --> 42:26.989
Becky's making a very strong
play by putting Vanessa up and

42:26.990 --> 42:27.990
going against her agreements.

42:27.991 --> 42:34.989
When you make strong plays, you
gotta, prepared to play with the

42:34.990 --> 42:35.990
consequences as well.

42:35.991 --> 42:38.989
It's about time Vanessa feels
the block.

42:38.990 --> 42:43.829
I mean she's put a lot of us up
there and not worried about it.

42:43.830 --> 42:46.989
There's going to be tears,
yelling, at pretty much

42:46.990 --> 42:46.991
everyone.

42:46.991 --> 42:47.990
It's going to get crazy.

42:47.991 --> 42:53.999
Will be ericht eevicted from the
"Big Brother" house, Vanessa or

42:54.000 --> 42:54.950
Shelli?

42:54.951 --> 42:56.989
Plus it's a special
double-eviction episode.

42:56.990 --> 42:59.409
It's a weekee worth of "big
brother" in one hour.

42:59.410 --> 43:04.989
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:04.990 --> 43:05.990
brother."
