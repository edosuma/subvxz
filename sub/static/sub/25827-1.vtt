   <i> was the size of her nose</i>    
  <i> and the size of my waist.</i>    

07:36.857 --> 07:38.557
 [Bobby] So, what do you want   
         to do first?           

07:38.559 --> 07:41.993
           [Joanie]             
Um, why don't we try that one?  

07:43.163 --> 07:45.964
 [Bobby] Really? Mr. Conceited  
        is running it.          

07:45.966 --> 07:49.000
           Bobby Marks,         
           are you jealous? Heh.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.836
            We got              
  some last-minute gamblers?

          Yeah. Yeah.

Well, I don't mind              
watching him back here,         

08:49.863 --> 08:52.130
but, um, it might be            
better for business             

08:52.132 --> 08:53.798
if you carried him around       
for a bit.

         Heh.                   

09:03.777 --> 09:05.544
    Did he have something caught
    in his eye or something?    

09:05.546 --> 09:07.646
             Maybe we should    
             send over a doctor.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.181
    Also, wasn't there some     
sort of dress code or something?

09:10.183 --> 09:13.318
              I mean, if not,   
              there should be.  

09:13.320 --> 09:16.555

    that actually fit him?

You don't have to go.           

09:48.855 --> 09:50.322
You can stay with us.

You can have my room            
and I'll sleep on the couch.

Just tell me why.

            You walked here.    

14:25.432 --> 14:27.398
        I like                  
        a boy with enterprise.  

14:28.201 --> 14:30.001
              How old are you?  

14:30.003 --> 14:31.236
        Uh...                   

14:31.238 --> 14:32.971
                Speak up, boy.  

14:34.107 --> 14:36.608
          -Seventeen.           
          -Seventeen?           

14:39.512 --> 14:42.046
       Have you done            
       this sort of work before?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.249
Uh...no, sir.                   

14:44.251 --> 14:46.217
Not yet.                        

14:46.219 --> 14:49.454
       Well then, I don't think 
       you're right for the job.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.957
     It's not easy work and this
     is not a small property.   

14:54.127 --> 14:57.629
  Oh. Uh, okay...               

14:59.199 --> 15:01.499
                 That is it?    

15:02.269 --> 15:04.002
 Sir?                           

15:04.004 --> 15:06.971
       You're not going to fight
       for it, for the job?     

15:06.973 --> 15:10.275
Uh...I don't understand.        

15:10.277 --> 15:12.443
          You want the job, yes?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.646
              Then you should   
              not acquiesce     

15:14.648 --> 15:17.348
              and accept my no  
              as the final no.  

15:17.350 --> 15:20.051
       You should try           
       to convince me otherwise.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.352
Convince you?                   

15:21.354 --> 15:22.921
                       Indeed.  

15:22.923 --> 15:26.624
Uh. Well, I'm sure              
I can do this job, sir,         

15:26.626 --> 15:28.192
if you just give me             
a chance--                      

15:28.194 --> 15:29.294
      I don't have time to train

15:29.296 --> 15:31.329
           a boy with no skills.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.131
    Oh. Um...                   

15:34.301 --> 15:36.501
Well, uh,                       
I learn really quick.           

15:36.503 --> 15:38.569
           -Quickly.            
   -And all my teachers say     

15:38.571 --> 15:40.305

15:40.307 --> 15:41.673
                 No. "Quickly"  
                 is the adverb  

15:41.675 --> 15:43.341
           modifying            
           the verb "to learn". 

15:43.343 --> 15:45.243
             "I learn quickly." 
             Begin again.       

15:45.245 --> 15:47.578
Uh, all my teachers             
say that

15:49.282 --> 15:51.716
You won't regret                
for a moment hiring me.         

15:51.718 --> 15:53.351
                  Excellent.    

15:53.353 --> 15:54.719
                 Much better.   

15:54.721 --> 15:56.054

15:56.056 --> 15:59.123
Uh, no, we summer here.

                with the locals 

16:00.727 --> 16:04.729
         has been               
         less than satisfactory.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.597
                 Very well.     

16:06.599 --> 16:08.599

             do it on purpose.

sort of way.                    

18:16.329 --> 18:18.496
    Well you would have had     
 to say, "Marino, Pete Marino"  

18:18.498 --> 18:19.630
       to do that, but.

So, am I going to be seeing     
you around the club this summer?

           with Joanie?

I don't play anymore.           

18:47.660 --> 18:49.227

                 a conscience.

           Hi.                  

57:49.033 --> 57:51.233
    Mom, what are you           
    doing back already?         

57:51.235 --> 57:52.968
                     Hello.     

57:53.904 --> 57:55.704
     What happened to your face?

57:55.706 --> 57:57.473
       -What did you do?        
          -Oh. Oh...            

57:57.475 --> 57:59.775
Um, a branch. At work.          
I walked into it.               

57:59.777 --> 58:00.976
   It's fine.                   

58:00.978 --> 58:02.511
                Did you put     
                some ice on it? 

58:02.513 --> 58:04.179
                No. Hold on.    

58:04.982 --> 58:06.248
     How was the city?          

58:06.250 --> 58:10.018
                 Uh, you know,  
                 it's...hot.

58:15.593 --> 58:16.692
                He's fine.      

58:16.694 --> 58:17.793
  What's he doing?              

58:17.795 --> 58:18.994
           Some project at work.

58:18.996 --> 58:21.530
       I didn't get the details.

58:21.532 --> 58:23.232
             Where's Michelle?  

58:24.735 --> 58:26.068
Still sleeping, I guess.        

58:26.070 --> 58:27.970
           Really?              
           She's not in her bed.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.138
  Oh, right. Um, ahem.          

58:30.140 --> 58:32.774
  Well, I... Uh, she...         

58:32.776 --> 58:34.276
    Oh yeah, I forgot,          
    she had to go               

58:34.278 --> 58:36.211
    to some early               
    counselor thing today.

     -Speak of the devil.       
     -Hey, you're back...       

58:40.584 --> 58:42.251
           from that            
   early counselors meeting.    

58:42.253 --> 58:43.752
        That was quick.         

58:43.754 --> 58:47.122
Yeah.                           
Yeah, it was. Heh.

         -Michelle...           
     -[Michelle] Mm-hmm...      

58:49.894 --> 58:52.094

        -It was great!

            -7:30.

            Wow...              

58:57.234 --> 58:59.201
  [Lenore] That's such a lie,   
       and you know it.         

58:59.203 --> 59:00.869
-[Michelle] No, it's not, Mom.  
  -[Lenore] Yes. Michelle...

                    Ali himself.

59:06.010 --> 59:08.076
Yeah, sorry about that.         

59:09.613 --> 59:12.548
        That from your wrestling
        match with the chair?   

59:12.550 --> 59:13.916
     Uh. No.                    

59:13.918 --> 59:15.684
            -Um...              
     -[arguing continues]       

59:15.686 --> 59:19.154
Yeah, look, you might           
want to get out of here.        

59:20.891 --> 59:22.858
                       Damn.    

59:22.860 --> 59:24.259
                     Too bad.   

59:25.195 --> 59:26.562
       Uh...                    

59:26.564 --> 59:28.030
   Say, can I...                

59:28.032 --> 59:29.565
               Can I bum a ride?

59:29.567 --> 59:32.200
           I'll be late for work
           otherwise.           

59:33.804 --> 59:36.672
      That Willie Rumson        
ever give you any more trouble? 

59:36.674 --> 59:39.107
             Willie? Rumson?    

59:40.210 --> 59:41.944
    Yeah, that skid             
    from the carnival           

59:41.946 --> 59:43.712
    who was picking on you      
    and your girlfriend.        

59:43.714 --> 59:45.914
            Joanie's            
            not my girlfriend.  

59:45.916 --> 59:48.317
Anyway, that guy.               

59:48.319 --> 59:50.052
                 No. Why?       

59:50.054 --> 59:52.354
He used to beat me up           
when I was your age.            

59:54.224 --> 59:56.224
I was still pretty new          
around here.                    

59:56.226 --> 59:59.361
   And this place               
   doesn't like new.            

59:59.363 --> 01:00:02.264
His gang jumped me one night    
and laid into me pretty good.   

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.968
           But you're not afraid
           of him now.          

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.905
My older brother Vinnie--       
you meet him?                   

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:12.074
He brought some friends home    
from college                    

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.710
and we cleaned out              
the Rummies but good.           

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:17.212
  They haven't messed           
  with a Marino since.          

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.224
            Can I ask you       
            a question, sir?    

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.730
     Have you ever been bullied?

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:37.799
      Why do you ask?           

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.736
    There's this guy who doesn't
    seem to like me very much.  

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:43.872
        I don't know why.       
        I haven't done anything.

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:46.141
          Not really anyway.    

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.743
    But, but then there's Pete--

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.645
          you know,             
          from the beach club-- 

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:53.348
       and he said that         
       that guy bullied him too.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:56.685
         So, he got his brother 
         to beat up the guy     

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.720
         and now the guy        
         leaves him alone, so...

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:02.157
         I got to wondering,    
         what if Pete's right?  

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.192
         What if the only way   
         to deal with a bully   

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.894

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.886
           Robert, consistency  

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:01.889
           is the foundation    
           of tradition.        

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:04.259

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:33.488

           of reward.

           over justice.        

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:46.501
Well, what's                    
the difference?                 

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:49.537
         Well, there's quite    
         a gulf between the two.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.007
           The measure of a man 
           is his ability

             to a "proper" shore
