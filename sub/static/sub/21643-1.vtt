I've devoted my entire life
to spreading the gospel of marijuana,

00:45.612 --> 00:47.547
the miraculous plant that has the power

00:47.614 --> 00:49.749

01:13.440 --> 01:14.307
Thank you.

Don't worry, that's just a Taser gun.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.779
You've never had to use that thing,
right, Carter?

01:20.580 --> 01:21.815
Had to? No.

isn't about withdrawing from your family.

I'm just joking, I'm just joking.
All good.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.116
Oh, my God, that is so fun.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.119
That is so much better
than the shit my kids watch.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.322
[groans] Did you ever see  Caillou?

12:38.524 --> 12:39.391
I lived it.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.428
So, what'd you do before this?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.462
I was in the Army.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.297
-Oh, where?
-Iraq.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.133
Oh.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.970
Our side, I hope. Heh.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.307
Excuse me, just gonna--
Excuse me for a second.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.246
Maria, how's your medication working?
You feeling healped?

13:00.312 --> 13:03.282
Well, at first I was very happy,
but now I'm a little sad.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.783
Oh, no. What's going on?

13:04.850 --> 13:08.921
I thought he was surly because he's black,
but it turns out it was war.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.460
Okay, it's important to remember
that marijuana doesn't mask your emotions.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.229
-If anything, it amplifies--
-Holy shit, a chair.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.532
You better believe
I'm sitting in that thing.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.804
How you doing, Carter?

13:26.939 --> 13:29.074
-She asked me where I served, I told her.
-Yeah.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.277
Don't worry about that.
If you ever wanna talk,

13:31.343 --> 13:32.344
my door's always open.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.847
-Got it.
-And it goes without saying,

13:34.914 --> 13:36.815
if you need any product, on the house.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.350
No, thank you. I don't smoke.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.921
Never?
Why, I find that really hard to believe.

13:42.354 --> 13:45.124
I'm not saying that
I don't get curious about it sometimes,

13:45.191 --> 13:47.226
but then I see people like her...

13:52.865 --> 13:54.033
And then it passes.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.205
Okay, well, if you ever need me,
I'm here for you.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.407
Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Do not worry.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.476
Do not...

14:06.178 --> 14:07.046
worry.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.948
[man]  Post-traumatic

14:09.014 --> 14:10.182
As in "later"

14:10.950 --> 14:12.218
After the return

14:13.085 --> 14:13.986
Recurrence

14:14.053 --> 14:15.187
Mocking time

14:15.254 --> 14:16.589
Invading distance

14:16.855 --> 14:18.891
Home and safety no deterrents

14:19.058 --> 14:20.960
Rippling through the bombed-out crater

14:21.026 --> 14:22.962
Of a mind that lacks resistance

14:23.028 --> 14:25.264
In a man who lacks insurance

14:25.531 --> 14:27.066
Awe his symptom

14:27.132 --> 14:28.267
Shock his illness

14:28.567 --> 14:30.636
Shaken beyond all endurance

14:31.170 --> 14:33.906
Shrapnel shooting through his stillness

14:34.473 --> 14:36.075
Scanning his periphery

14:36.242 --> 14:38.177
For targets only he can see

14:39.078 --> 14:41.113
He pulls the pins of memory

14:41.347 --> 14:44.950
And finds in each an IED

14:45.184 --> 14:47.286
A brother in a band alone

14:47.586 --> 14:53.125
With his unknown unknown unknown

14:57.329 --> 14:58.197
I'm fine.

15:05.604 --> 15:06.639
[in Australian accent] G'day, ladies.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.241
Working up a thirst?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.578
May I offer you a bevvy?

15:15.981 --> 15:17.316
That's right.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.118
Sip it slow.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.087
Take it down to the roots.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.391
Pete, you're talking Australian again.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.527
Am I?

15:29.361 --> 15:30.229
Crikey.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.131
[laughs]

15:32.197 --> 15:34.566
[in normal voice] It's so weird
that I do that. [laughs]

15:36.235 --> 15:37.703
-You want?
-Thank you.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.674
-Must be nice to have Travis back.
-Eh.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.712
He's got all these business ideas
for the store.

15:46.979 --> 15:50.282
I'm your boss, I think it's crazy
and stupid, but what are your thoughts?

15:51.717 --> 15:55.988
Well... I really don't think
of my thoughts as mine.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.256
You know?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.291
They come, they go.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.428
Sometimes they wonder
what urine tastes like.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.331
Salty.

16:08.233 --> 16:12.404
[sighs] Well, the times are changing,
Pete. You know, back in the day...

16:13.038 --> 16:14.473
marijuana was a cause.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.009
It was a symbol of defiance.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.711
Now it's just a commodity.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.681
Hey, you ever see my Woo in Rage speech?

16:22.748 --> 16:23.615
Yeah.

16:24.049 --> 16:24.717
Wait.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.285
No.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.488
Oh, 1972.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.291
First ever HEMP Day March
on Washington, D.C.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.761
That's HEMP,
as in Help End Marijuana Prohibition.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.597
But also hemp as in... hemp,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.499
-so, there's a double meaning.
-Yeah.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.034
No fooling you.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.171
Listen up, Tricky Dick.

16:46.605 --> 16:50.509
We're here today because we smoke grass.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.177
[crowd cheers]

16:52.244 --> 16:55.714
And we're tired of being arrested
for smoking grass.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.282
[crowd cheers]

16:57.349 --> 16:59.151
And we're tired of the war.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.254
But we like grass.

17:03.789 --> 17:06.058
That's right. We "woo."

17:06.224 --> 17:07.526
[crowd] Woo!

17:07.593 --> 17:09.261
We "woo" in anger.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.695
[crowd] Woo!

17:10.762 --> 17:12.631
We "woo" for justice.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.435
We "woo" for those who have had
their freedom taken away

17:17.502 --> 17:19.771
and can no longer "woo" for themselves.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.675
It's hard to believe I got so worked up

17:24.742 --> 17:27.646
over what I now realize
was really shitty pot.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.287
I honestly don't think
she's capable of change.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.090
I think there's some damage up here
from all the healping.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.095
What's it with you Jewish guys
and your mommy issues?

17:44.296 --> 17:45.464
I'm only half-Jewish.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.734
Believe me,
it's not as easy as Drake makes it look.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.838
I'm sorry. Has it been tough being you?

17:53.472 --> 17:54.373
Are you kidding me?

17:54.540 --> 17:57.709
My father was a Black Panther
who became a corporate lawyer

17:57.776 --> 18:00.446
for a big pharmaceutical company,
and my mother, well...

18:02.214 --> 18:04.583
I mean, you've met that batshit nonsense.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.685
I happen to like your mom.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.621
Sure. She's great.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.223
She's a legend.

18:11.657 --> 18:15.094
But she's also the reason I've
had acid reflux since I was 6 years old.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.131
So, I'm guessing it's
the lower half of you that's Jewish?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.805
So, what's your sad story?

18:28.107 --> 18:31.376
I don't have one.
I grew up in a lovely little town in Iowa.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.246
Everybody knew everybody.
No one locked their doors.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.747
Then why'd you leave?

18:35.814 --> 18:37.883
'Cause people kept walking in
and taking shit.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.187
The whole town was hooked
on meth and crack.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.724
Drugs are a big problem
in that part of the country, right?

18:48.193 --> 18:50.529
Do you not see the hypocrisy
in what you just did?

18:51.163 --> 18:55.334
Oh, come on, you can't equate marijuana
with meth and crack.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.237
I mean,
that's like apples and meth and crack.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.674
If you feel that way,
why are you working here?

19:03.442 --> 19:05.177
Have you been watching? I'm not.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.578
I've been on break since ten.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.917
You're not who I thought you were.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.187
-Neither are you.
-Who did you think I was?

19:17.222 --> 19:19.291
Let's save that for another time.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.398
Okay, then.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.332
Yes.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.407
In a couple hours,

19:35.474 --> 19:37.676
I'll think of the perfect thing
to say right now.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.317
Have you ordered a pizza?
Has it not arrived yet?

19:45.384 --> 19:48.187
You could be entitled to punitive
and compensatory damages

19:48.253 --> 19:49.688
up to $5 million.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.825
At Young and High, we specialize in cases
of extreme snack delay.

19:53.892 --> 19:56.562
Our attorneys have a combined
60 years' experience

19:56.628 --> 19:58.864
in helping victims
of Dilatory Foodstuff Syndrome

19:58.931 --> 20:01.533
get the restitution and justice
they deserve.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.670
And we don't get a slice unless you do.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.273
Oh, God, that's good.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.475
Call the attorneys
at Young and High right now.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.612
Because after all, it's been 45 minutes.
Am I right? What the fuck?

20:13.679 --> 20:14.580
Call now.

20:16.648 --> 20:20.452
[in foreign language] No, Dad, gynecology
won't turn me into a lesbian.

20:23.288 --> 20:23.989
[knock]

20:24.256 --> 20:25.657
Hey, boss. You got a second?

20:26.291 --> 20:28.694
Boss? Come on,
we're a couple of liberated women.

20:28.961 --> 20:29.928
Call me sir.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.567
What you reading?

20:35.634 --> 20:37.002
The Power of Now.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.004
I can finish it later.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.009
What's up?

20:44.276 --> 20:45.477
I hope I'm not out of line,

20:45.611 --> 20:48.747
but I wanted to put in
my two cents about Travis' business plan.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.016
Well, I'm happy to talk to you, but...

20:51.683 --> 20:54.353
as I said to Travis... fuck that shit.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.626
Can't fault your logic. Um...

21:00.692 --> 21:03.829
But just so you know,
he really did put a lot of work into it.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.664
You know, it means a lot to him.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.938
Are you and my son a thing?

21:13.872 --> 21:14.740
What?

21:15.974 --> 21:17.042
No, we're not.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.577
[laughs] You sure?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.579
-You two are not a thing?
-No.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.281
[chuckles] No, we're not.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.816
We're two separate things.
We keep our things separate.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.654
Okay, but, uh...

21:29.521 --> 21:30.489
FYI...

21:31.823 --> 21:33.358
it's true what they say.

21:33.725 --> 21:36.328
Once you go half-black, you never...

21:42.668 --> 21:44.803
Actually,
I don't know what happens after that.

21:46.972 --> 21:47.973
Okay. Look, I don't--

21:48.040 --> 21:49.841
I don't really have a stake in this,
I'm just...

21:50.509 --> 21:54.079
Ugh. I don't know,
I'm suggesting that you give him a chance.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.914
You know, acknowledge his efforts.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.785
Oh, you millennials,
you're always asking for validation.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.087
Everybody gets a quidditch trophy.

22:02.354 --> 22:03.822
[laughing]

22:06.358 --> 22:08.026
Does Travis know you're here?

22:08.093 --> 22:10.095
No, and, uh, please, don't tell him.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.731
Okay, so, this is what we're gonna do.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.334
I'll talk to him, you know,
do the mother thing...

22:16.068 --> 22:17.636
and you'll start dating him.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.104
What?

22:19.738 --> 22:22.574
Well, Olivia, the other way around
doesn't make sense.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.945
And to tell you the truth,
you'd really be good for him.

22:27.779 --> 22:28.647
Okay.

22:29.347 --> 22:30.649
Well, that's... I mean...

22:31.116 --> 22:32.117
Who knows?

22:35.387 --> 22:36.121
Thank you.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.024
But who knows? [laughs]

22:43.028 --> 22:44.129
Oh, I know.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.807
Hi, I'm Travis Feldman,
from Ruth's Alternative Caring,

22:55.874 --> 22:59.478
and welcome to the first installment
of Strain O' the Day.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.746
-Pete?
-Travis.

23:01.780 --> 23:02.714
No, you go.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.416
Oh, okay.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.719
Today we have the very popular Blue Dream.

23:07.786 --> 23:12.457
But this one is an artisanal grow
just in from Humboldt County. Take a look.

23:15.927 --> 23:18.730
As you can see,
it has terpy nugs and trichomes

23:18.797 --> 23:22.534
that are capitate-stalked
rather than bulbous or capitate-sessile.

23:24.536 --> 23:25.537
As you can see.

23:26.505 --> 23:30.108
Our Strain O' the Day offers
a truly expansive and cerebral experience.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.110
Perfect for an early afternoon session.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.779
One, one-thirty.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.883
Probably 1:15 would be the best time
for this strain.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.719
I could totally see myself
smoking this at 1:15.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.088
So, come on down
to Ruth's Alternative Caring,

23:43.155 --> 23:44.856
because when it comes to healing...

23:45.791 --> 23:46.758
See you soon.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.430
Thank you. Happy medicating.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.035
Travis.

23:57.502 --> 24:00.105
I want you to know
I'm still opposed to this document

24:00.172 --> 24:01.807
and everything it represents.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.108
But...

24:03.775 --> 24:05.210
I admire your initiative...

24:05.577 --> 24:07.712
and therefore,
I've decided to actually read it.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.616
-Stoned?
-You have my word.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.187
Did Olivia talk to you?

24:15.854 --> 24:17.222
Absolutely not.

24:17.856 --> 24:19.191
If anything, she didn't.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.931
Ruth, I-- I just wanna thank you.
I'm ready to go out into the world, and--

24:25.997 --> 24:28.767
And be a mother to my children,
a wife to my husband.

24:28.834 --> 24:29.701
I mean, who knows?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.903
The mister might even get a handy tonight.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.038
[both giggle]

24:34.206 --> 24:35.874
That's so nice.

24:38.176 --> 24:41.112
Here, have some cannabis massage oil,
on the house.

24:41.847 --> 24:42.948
Will it make him high?

24:43.014 --> 24:44.115
Just his penis.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.486
You see, Travis?

24:48.553 --> 24:52.891
Nothing will ever replace the intimacy
of person-to-person interaction.

24:52.958 --> 24:56.561
And all I wanna do is get more people
in here for you to interact with.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.830
Travis, you have to understand,

24:58.897 --> 25:02.234
I've spent my entire life
fighting the Man.

25:02.868 --> 25:05.537
The last thing I wanna do
is become the Man.

25:05.704 --> 25:06.805
Why?

25:06.872 --> 25:08.540
You know there'll always be a Man.

25:09.541 --> 25:10.742
Why can't he be us?

25:12.277 --> 25:14.179
Because then who would I be mad at?

25:16.514 --> 25:17.649
Well, no one.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.084
You'd be happy.

25:20.585 --> 25:21.720
I don't understand.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.589
Let me try it a different way.

25:25.790 --> 25:26.925
If you became the Man...

25:27.893 --> 25:29.561
you wouldn't be the Man...

25:29.961 --> 25:31.796
'cause you'd be the Woman.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.099
I mean, think about it. A woman...

25:35.300 --> 25:37.535
but with the power of a man.

25:39.905 --> 25:42.807
Jesus Christ, that's just offensive.

25:44.242 --> 25:45.977
Yeah, uh-huh, I heard it when I said it.

25:47.279 --> 25:50.081
Look, all I'm asking for you
is to just trust me a little.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.284
I can do a little.

25:53.685 --> 25:54.686
Thanks.

25:55.186 --> 25:56.154
I love you.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.155
I love you, too.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.156
Come here.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.561
I think you could bang Olivia.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.910
[grunts]

27:03.088 --> 27:04.022
No, no, no.
