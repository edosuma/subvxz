WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.945
We have a president
who not only took

00:02.987 --> 00:06.865
mind-altering medication,
a man who has his finger on the button

00:06.865 --> 00:09.034
while US ships
are squaring off with China,

00:09.034 --> 00:12.454
but then instructed his White
House counsel to coach a...

00:12.454 --> 00:16.833
- Allegedly, sir, not proven.
- To coach a witness.

00:16.833 --> 00:19.752
Which is behavior either
resulting from the use of those drugs,

00:19.752 --> 00:22.505
or worse, a deliberate attempt
to obstruct the law.

00:22.505 --> 00:25.382
Wouldn't you call
either scenario impeachable?

00:25.382 --> 00:28.385
That's for the United States
Congress to decide, sir, not me.

00:28.385 --> 00:31.012
Were you aware that the president
was taking any form of medication?

00:31.012 --> 00:34.682
- No, I was not. - Did you notice him
acting in a bizarre fashion?

00:34.682 --> 00:36.517
- Unstable, incoherent?
- No, sir.

00:36.517 --> 00:38.811
- Any odd behavior?
- No, sir.

00:38.811 --> 00:42.314
Not even firing his chief of staff
in the midst of a trade war?

00:42.314 --> 00:44.608
He didn't fire me. I resigned.

00:44.608 --> 00:49.237
- Would you tell us why?
- I resigned because I felt

00:49.237 --> 00:52.324
I could no longer serve the president
to the best of my ability.

00:52.324 --> 00:55.368
And what changed? How did you
come to that conclusion?

00:56.828 --> 00:59.914
I had some fundamental
differences of opinion

00:59.914 --> 01:01.916
with certain people
in the White House.

01:01.916 --> 01:04.459
- Like who? The president?
- No, sir.

01:04.459 --> 01:06.712
What "certain people" then?

01:06.712 --> 01:09.256
One person, actually.
The vice president.

01:09.256 --> 01:12.592
- Frank Underwood.
- He wanted you gone?

01:12.592 --> 01:16.304
I can't speak as to what
the vice president did or didn't want.

01:16.304 --> 01:20.933
Was he trying to hide anything?
Was he afraid you might expose something?

01:20.933 --> 01:22.893
You'd have to ask him, sir.

01:22.893 --> 01:25.646
What's happening in the
Judiciary Committee is a farce.

01:25.687 --> 01:29.483
- The Republicans are exploiting...
- Excuse me, Mr. Vice President,

01:29.483 --> 01:31.735
but it's not just Republicans.

01:31.735 --> 01:35.989
A number of Democrats have come out
saying they would support impeachment.

01:35.989 --> 01:38.616
Including the majority whip,
Jackie Sharp.

01:38.616 --> 01:42.369
Which is egregious, since the committee
hasn't stopped hearing testimony,

01:42.369 --> 01:45.164
nor has the special prosecutor
completed her investigation.

01:45.164 --> 01:47.291
You vigorously
defend the president,

01:47.291 --> 01:49.835
but there are reports that
you've had a falling out,

01:49.835 --> 01:52.754
- that you haven't spoken in weeks.
- That is simply not true.

01:52.754 --> 01:55.298
I've spoken to senior staff
at the White House

01:55.298 --> 01:59.302
who say the president is worried
you want to run against him in 2016.

01:59.302 --> 02:02.346
And just today Linda Vasquez
intimated that you...

02:02.346 --> 02:05.766
Look, I fully expect that
the president will run in 2016,

02:05.766 --> 02:09.186
and I hope that he's generous
enough to invite me to be his running mate.

02:09.186 --> 02:11.771
Impeachment, conviction,
let's say it happens.

02:11.771 --> 02:13.857
It won't.
He's completely innocent.

02:13.857 --> 02:15.900
Let's say it does happen.
You become president...

02:15.900 --> 02:17.944
That is not a scenario
I'm going to entertain.

02:17.944 --> 02:20.321
The thought must
have crossed your mind.

02:20.321 --> 02:24.074
And one could make the argument that the
president wouldn't be in this predicament

02:24.074 --> 02:28.412
if it weren't for you. It's your staff's
involvement with Feng and Lanagin

02:28.412 --> 02:30.830
that expanded Dunbar's
investigation,

02:30.830 --> 02:33.249
- which resulted in the travel logs...
- These impeachment hearings

02:33.249 --> 02:35.752
are the result
of political maneuvering, not...

02:35.752 --> 02:37.587
Your maneuverings,
or the Republicans?

02:37.587 --> 02:41.924
Morley, I've always liked you.
You ask the tough questions.

02:41.924 --> 02:44.051
And you can certainly
question my judgment,

02:44.051 --> 02:46.470
but do not question
my patriotism.

02:46.470 --> 02:50.390
I serve this nation
and my president, not myself.

02:50.390 --> 02:53.726
- He's lying through his teeth.
- What we're doing is working.

02:53.726 --> 02:55.687
We keep the whisper
campaign alive.

02:55.687 --> 02:58.356
We spin him as power hungry,
as duplicitous.

02:58.356 --> 03:00.858
- Focus attention on him, not you.
- What's the latest?

03:00.858 --> 03:05.612
- Twenty percent? - Zogby has you at 24.
Your speech made a difference.

03:05.654 --> 03:09.741
The approval numbers
are moving in the right direction.

03:09.741 --> 03:13.036
We need to do more
than play the spin game.

03:13.036 --> 03:15.288
We need to destroy Frank.

03:15.288 --> 03:18.124
Offer his head instead of mine.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.544
- We use Raymond Tusk.
- How?

03:21.544 --> 03:25.130
At his hearing.
When he goes to the judiciary.

03:25.130 --> 03:28.425
Sir, you're already being
accused of coaching one witness.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.886
- If you take steps to coach another...
- Not coaching. The truth.

03:31.886 --> 03:33.638
Raymond admits
to the money laundering,

03:33.638 --> 03:36.599
puts Frank at the center of
this, and says I knew nothing.

03:36.599 --> 03:39.644
And then we'll reward him
for his honesty.

03:39.644 --> 03:41.395
You mean a pardon?

03:44.189 --> 03:47.901
- I want you to talk to him.
- And put myself at risk?

03:47.901 --> 03:50.195
You're not part of this
administration anymore.

03:50.195 --> 03:53.490
There's no law that says you can't
pay Raymond Tusk a visit.

03:53.490 --> 03:58.953
And in return, resignations
don't have to last forever.

04:01.747 --> 04:06.710
If I do this, you have to be
a million miles away.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.545
Tricia and I will
go to Camp David.

04:08.545 --> 04:14.425
It's not a million miles away,
but it'll do the job.

04:14.425 --> 04:16.344
I can go after Linda,
dig into her past...

04:16.344 --> 04:19.055
Neutralizing her won't
neutralize the bigger problem.

04:19.055 --> 04:22.141
- The president is after blood.
- Then what's his move?

04:22.141 --> 04:26.103
He can't ask me to resign,
he'd have to force me out.

04:26.103 --> 04:30.357
And to do that, if I were him...

04:30.357 --> 04:33.318
...I would return
to the hand that first fed me.

04:33.318 --> 04:35.445
- Raymond Tusk?
- Exactly.

04:35.445 --> 04:37.822
He'd have to implicate himself
to implicate you.

04:37.822 --> 04:39.740
Not if he gets a pardon.

04:39.740 --> 04:43.327
It's the one thing that only
a president can offer.

04:43.327 --> 04:45.329
Tusk is a hand grenade.
If he pardons him...

04:45.329 --> 04:46.788
You're right.
Tusk is a hand grenade.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.874
We need to pull the pin
and throw him at Walker

04:48.874 --> 04:51.876
before Walker pulls the pin
and throws him at us.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.754
I want to meet with Raymond.
One-on-one.

04:54.754 --> 04:56.798
Let me speak on your behalf.
That way if anyone finds out...

04:56.798 --> 04:59.884
I know Raymond. He won't
respond to anyone but me.

04:59.884 --> 05:03.220
- When's his hearing scheduled?
- Day after tomorrow.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.973
- Two p.m.
- That gives us...

05:05.973 --> 05:09.976
- ...40 hours to make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

06:57.575 --> 06:59.577
I think it's mine.

07:03.247 --> 07:07.334
Seth, it's four in the morning.

07:07.334 --> 07:10.170
- When?
- I want you to go with her.

07:10.170 --> 07:11.713
I'll get it cleared right now.

07:11.713 --> 07:13.715
Thank you.

07:15.508 --> 07:17.844
Meechum says the plane
will be ready in 30 minutes.

07:17.844 --> 07:21.055
- OK, good.
- Think it was just a panic attack,

07:21.055 --> 07:22.890
- or was she really trying...
- I don't know.

07:22.890 --> 07:25.184
It was bad enough they felt
they had to keep her overnight.

07:25.184 --> 07:26.810
I'm gonna call the White
House physician's office,

07:26.810 --> 07:28.687
- see if they can recommend anyone.
- OK.

07:28.687 --> 07:32.148
- Oh, wait, my phone.
- It's in your hand.

07:33.817 --> 07:36.277
I'll be back sometime tonight.

07:37.236 --> 07:40.156
Impeachment is our only chance.

07:40.156 --> 07:43.534
Here are the seats that are still in
contention in the midterms.

07:43.534 --> 07:47.746
These 13 we're gonna lose, no matter what
we do. But even if we win all the rest,

07:47.746 --> 07:51.166
that only leaves us
with a five-seat majority.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.501
We either save the party
or we save the president.

07:53.501 --> 07:55.753
Anyone who votes
against impeachment

07:55.753 --> 07:59.090
is gonna get pummeled by attack ads
between now and election day.

07:59.090 --> 08:01.801
- How many do you have already?
- We need 18.

08:01.801 --> 08:06.555
- I have six.
- So 12 more to go.

08:06.597 --> 08:10.809
Look, Donald,
I know this is a big ask,

08:10.809 --> 08:15.188
- and you prefer to focus on policy...
- Jackie, you can stop.

08:15.188 --> 08:17.648
- I'm on board.
- Really?

08:17.648 --> 08:19.900
One hundred percent.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.111
I have to say
I'm a little surprised.

08:22.111 --> 08:24.154
When you rolled those dollies
into the cloakroom,

08:24.154 --> 08:29.117
you said, "Work with me,
I'm not Frank Underwood."

08:29.117 --> 08:34.205
And then you helped get my stimulus
package through, just like you promised.

08:35.873 --> 08:38.083
And what do you
expect this time?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.169
That you never
become Frank Underwood.

08:41.169 --> 08:45.048
You must realize, if we're successful,
he will replace Walker.

08:45.048 --> 08:49.219
I don't like Frank, but I hate being in
the minority even more.

08:49.219 --> 08:51.972
We can't let the Republicans control
both houses of Congress.

08:51.972 --> 08:55.642
You've changed
since I joined the leadership.

08:55.642 --> 08:59.478
Just getting better
at playing the game.

08:59.478 --> 09:01.689
I guess you can teach
an old liberal new tricks.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.692
I guess so.

09:06.777 --> 09:09.237
So tell me who you still need.

09:09.237 --> 09:13.366
My lawyers are saying
fifty-fifty that I survive a trial.

09:13.366 --> 09:17.954
Now, I'm not a big fan of those
odds, but I'm willing to take them.

09:17.995 --> 09:20.373
If your lawyers are
putting it at a coin toss,

09:20.373 --> 09:23.000
then you're paying them too
much to be overly optimistic.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.295
How can I trust Garrett? He turned his
back on 20 years of friendship.

09:26.295 --> 09:27.963
He could accuse you of the same.

09:31.341 --> 09:36.763
Nobody on this planet wants to see
Frank Underwood go to jail more than I do.

09:36.763 --> 09:39.098
I just don't want to be
sharing a cell with him.

09:39.098 --> 09:40.975
That won't happen.

09:40.975 --> 09:44.561
All you've given me
to go on is Garrett's word.

09:44.561 --> 09:46.813
He's asking you
to tell the truth.

09:46.813 --> 09:49.191
Good things happen to those
who do the right thing.

09:51.985 --> 09:56.322
And you just expect
Frank to lie down, throw in the towel?

09:56.322 --> 09:59.700
We don't even give him the chance.
Your testimony knocks him out cold.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.870
Excuse me.

10:07.165 --> 10:09.876
Yes? Oh, thank you.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.544
Hold on.

10:13.463 --> 10:15.381
There you go.

10:28.518 --> 10:31.313
Care package, from my wife.

10:34.065 --> 10:37.276
Now, you were saying.

10:40.738 --> 10:44.158
I just want to warn you,
she's not herself right now.

10:44.158 --> 10:47.286
They had to put her
on some heavy doses.

10:47.286 --> 10:50.205
- Of what?
- Lithium, mostly.

10:50.205 --> 10:53.458
It was either that
or commit her for 30 days.

10:53.458 --> 10:57.336
She just took some,
so she might be a little...

11:03.509 --> 11:06.220
Megan?

11:27.990 --> 11:29.908
Stop.

11:41.836 --> 11:47.090
Your mom told me
they found you in the lake.

11:47.090 --> 11:51.219
- What do you care?
- I care very much.

11:53.638 --> 11:55.598
No, you don't.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.019
You don't use
somebody you care about.

12:06.316 --> 12:08.568
Whore.

12:08.568 --> 12:10.445
Slut.

12:10.445 --> 12:12.947
Bitch.

12:13.656 --> 12:16.409
Traitor.

12:16.409 --> 12:18.953
That's what they call me,

12:18.953 --> 12:22.581
in my mail, online.

12:23.832 --> 12:26.752
I wish I had never called.

12:26.752 --> 12:29.504
I wish I had never met you.

12:29.504 --> 12:35.385
I feel so stupid, believing what you
told me, thinking that you did care.

12:35.385 --> 12:39.138
I was getting better.

12:39.138 --> 12:41.432
You did this to me.

12:45.436 --> 12:49.147
Every time I take one
of these, I think of him.

12:49.189 --> 12:51.650
And the next face I think of?

12:51.650 --> 12:54.027
It's yours.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.742
I'm sorry that you felt used.

13:03.327 --> 13:04.870
You weren't.

13:07.247 --> 13:09.291
I just, um...

13:11.418 --> 13:17.006
Like I told you, the political
landscape shifted and we...

13:17.006 --> 13:19.717
...found...

13:23.721 --> 13:26.098
Megan?

13:41.695 --> 13:45.115
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I got your text.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.119
I know I shouldn't be reaching
out to you, but I thought...

13:49.119 --> 13:50.370
<i>No, that doesn't matter.</i>

13:50.370 --> 13:52.747
I'm glad you did. How is she?

13:55.208 --> 13:57.293
In bad shape.

13:57.293 --> 14:00.296
I'm surprised they even let her
out of the hospital, to be honest.

14:00.296 --> 14:02.798
Is there anything I can do?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.550
Should I contact her family,

14:04.550 --> 14:07.135
<i>or go out there myself?</i>

14:07.135 --> 14:10.055
We should probably
leave her alone.

14:10.055 --> 14:14.809
<i>- Are you OK?</i>
- I'm fine.

14:14.851 --> 14:19.313
- How about you?
- <i> Holding up.</i>

14:19.313 --> 14:23.150
I spent the whole day
talking to lawyers.

14:24.193 --> 14:26.904
It's hard on the kids.

14:26.904 --> 14:31.449
They're embarrassed, and
frightened, but we'll get through it.

14:31.449 --> 14:36.162
I thought the speech you
and Garrett gave was very moving.

14:36.162 --> 14:38.372
<i>Well, it seems</i>
<i>to have helped some.</i>

14:38.372 --> 14:41.375
I was inspired by you, actually.

14:41.375 --> 14:45.337
When you admitted
to the abortion on TV.

14:45.337 --> 14:48.423
<i>The truth is a powerful thing.</i>

14:52.510 --> 14:56.514
Tricia, I want... to apologize.

14:56.514 --> 14:58.516
<i>What for?</i>

14:58.516 --> 15:00.684
I feel partly responsible
for everything

15:00.684 --> 15:03.062
your family is going through.

15:04.980 --> 15:08.900
It was my suggestion
that you get counseling.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.736
And had I known then,
I never would have said a word.

15:11.736 --> 15:16.282
Claire, please.
Counseling was a godsend.

15:16.282 --> 15:21.370
Garrett and I needed help, and it's made
things better. I should be thanking you.

15:21.370 --> 15:24.081
And thank you for letting me
know about Megan.

15:24.081 --> 15:26.208
It was kind of you
to make that trip.

15:26.208 --> 15:29.544
<i>You're a good person, Claire.</i>

15:29.544 --> 15:31.713
<i>Be well.</i>

17:23.147 --> 17:26.193
I take it
this is about my hearing?

17:26.193 --> 17:29.071
Did Walker get to you first?

17:29.071 --> 17:30.238
Barely.

17:30.238 --> 17:33.533
But sometimes barely is enough.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.910
I'm sure he
offered you a pardon.

17:35.910 --> 17:38.788
Always better to offer something
your competitor can't.

17:40.956 --> 17:44.585
- Oh, but I can.
- Hm.

17:44.585 --> 17:49.089
Last time I read the Constitution,
the most a vice president could offer

17:49.089 --> 17:52.008
was a... smile and wink.

17:52.008 --> 17:56.179
I think I've proven that I'm
not your typical vice president.

17:56.179 --> 17:58.848
Typical or not,
you've lost, Frank.

17:58.848 --> 18:01.559
I have an out. You don't.

18:01.559 --> 18:05.395
Garrett will not
survive impeachment.

18:05.395 --> 18:10.567
If there's one skill you can't deny,
it's my ability to whip votes.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.862
In the House, not in the Senate.

18:13.862 --> 18:16.948
Which the Constitution
makes me the president of.

18:16.948 --> 18:18.908
And you saw what
I did with entitlement.

18:18.908 --> 18:23.495
Hubris is giving you delusions
of grandeur, Frank.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.374
Let's say Walker squeaks by.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.292
Yes, you get your pardon,

18:29.292 --> 18:31.544
but you've bound yourself
at the hip to a man

18:31.544 --> 18:34.088
- who has zero
political capital.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.095
And if he gets convicted,
we all go to jail.

18:41.095 --> 18:45.140
- There's no pardon for anyone.
- I'll roll the dice.

18:48.685 --> 18:52.439
Raymond, think
like a businessman.

18:52.439 --> 18:56.401
Haven't you built a fortune
by minimizing risk?

18:56.401 --> 18:59.320
Isn't that why you stacked
Congress all these years,

18:59.320 --> 19:04.366
why you guided Garrett to the Oval
and why you kept me on as whip?

19:04.366 --> 19:08.203
Walker is a junk bond
quickly depreciating,

19:08.203 --> 19:12.707
whereas I can end the conflict with
China and keep you in the black.

19:12.707 --> 19:15.793
You can't promise better
relations with China.

19:15.793 --> 19:19.797
I wrecked them,
I can repair them.

19:19.797 --> 19:26.011
Now, let's work together,
as we always intended to do.

19:35.353 --> 19:40.858
When they put you in that box
barely bigger than a coffin...

19:43.485 --> 19:47.698
...remember how beautiful
the music was tonight.

19:49.574 --> 19:52.869
It might give you
some small degree of comfort.

19:56.789 --> 20:01.710
Puccini's a downer. I prefer
something much more optimistic.

20:10.260 --> 20:14.055
- They won't touch
Brown. The trial date is set.

20:14.055 --> 20:17.350
- They can reduce the charges.
- Dallas won't give.

20:17.350 --> 20:20.394
If I keep pressing,
it'll start to look suspect.

20:20.394 --> 20:24.481
What I can do is make sure
you don't get prosecuted.

20:24.481 --> 20:27.526
- And I stop working for you.
- Not quite.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.737
I told the US attorney that we
wanted to bring you on with us,

20:30.737 --> 20:35.366
- cyberterrorism division. You'd get
a clean slate... - No fucking way.

20:35.366 --> 20:38.703
They're not gonna let your case go
unless we give them a compelling reason.

20:38.703 --> 20:40.663
- There's no...
- I've spent half of my life

20:40.663 --> 20:43.415
- fighting the bureau.
- It's the only way I could sell it.

20:43.415 --> 20:47.502
Take this opportunity, Gavin,
before they change their minds.

20:47.502 --> 20:50.046
I want to meet
with Douglas Stamper.

20:50.046 --> 20:54.300
No. The deal was
I find you a way out...

20:54.300 --> 20:56.886
No, the deal was you help out
Brown and give me my freedom.

20:56.886 --> 20:59.889
You haven't done shit for Brown and
you want me to keep me under your thumb.

20:59.889 --> 21:03.142
So I meet Stamper,
or any kind of deal is off.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.490
Raymond said no.

21:19.490 --> 21:22.409
He said neither yes nor no.
I'll keep the pressure on.

21:22.409 --> 21:26.246
- So he could still name you.
- He could. Anything's possible.

21:26.246 --> 21:28.331
- You have to stop him.
- I'm trying.

21:28.331 --> 21:30.250
Trying's not enough, Francis.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.335
Well, I can't sit next
to him in the hearing room

21:32.335 --> 21:33.878
with a gun to his head.

21:33.878 --> 21:36.130
- That sounds like an excuse.
- It's a reality.

21:36.130 --> 21:39.508
You promised me I wasn't going
to have to prepare for the worst.

21:39.508 --> 21:42.178
- And I intend to keep that promise.
- Well, I want to be sure.

21:42.178 --> 21:44.805
- I want both of us to be sure.
- The only surefire way

21:44.805 --> 21:48.642
- is for Walker to call him off personally.
- Then make that happen.

21:48.642 --> 21:54.272
I cannot force a man who thinks I'm
his enemy to suddenly call me his friend.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.817
I've done what I had to do.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.903
Now you do what you have to do.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.447
Seduce him.
Give him your heart.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.784
Cut it out and put it
in his fucking hands.

23:15.888 --> 23:17.849
<i>Dear Mr. President.</i>

23:17.849 --> 23:21.644
<i>I'm writing you on an Underwood</i>
<i>portable my father gave me</i>

23:21.644 --> 23:23.520
<i>when I left for the</i> Sentinel.

23:23.520 --> 23:26.648
<i>It was the words my father said</i>
<i>when he gave it to me</i>

23:26.648 --> 23:32.529
<i>that resonated even more</i>
<i>than this 70-year-old machine.</i>

23:32.529 --> 23:35.782
<i>"This Underwood built</i>
<i>an empire," he said.</i>

23:35.782 --> 23:39.285
<i>"Now you go</i>
<i>and build one of your own."</i>

23:39.285 --> 23:44.206
<i>Those words have been a large part
of what has motivated my life.</i>

23:46.041 --> 23:49.377
<i>I've only written one other</i>
<i>letter with these keys.</i>

23:49.377 --> 23:51.546
<i>It did not fail me then.</i>

23:51.546 --> 23:55.425
I hope it will not fail me now.

23:55.425 --> 23:57.760
<i>You said I wanted</i>
<i>to diminish you.</i>

23:57.760 --> 23:59.637
The truth is I don't.

23:59.637 --> 24:02.806
You said I wanted
to challenge you in 2016.

24:02.806 --> 24:04.850
The truth is I don't.

24:04.850 --> 24:07.060
You said I wanted
the presidency for myself.

24:07.060 --> 24:12.816
The truth is... I do.

24:12.816 --> 24:15.485
What politician hasn't dreamed
about what it would be like

24:15.485 --> 24:19.113
<i>to take the oath of the</i>
<i>highest office of our land?</i>

24:19.113 --> 24:22.199
<i>I've stared at your desk</i>
<i>in the Oval and coveted it.</i>

24:22.199 --> 24:24.743
<i>The power. The prestige.</i>

24:24.743 --> 24:28.372
<i>Those things have a strong</i>
<i>pull on someone like me,</i>

24:28.372 --> 24:33.418
<i>who came from a small South Carolina
town with nothing.</i>

24:33.418 --> 24:38.339
<i>But since you assumed office,</i>
<i>my only aim has been to fight,</i>

24:38.339 --> 24:40.383
<i>for you and alongside you.</i>

24:40.383 --> 24:43.052
<i>Whether that be in Congress</i>
<i>or, as now,</i>

24:43.052 --> 24:45.387
<i>the battle over impeachment.</i>

24:45.387 --> 24:49.599
<i>Maybe one day I'll have my</i>
<i>chance to serve as president.</i>

24:49.599 --> 24:53.061
<i>But not while you</i>
<i>are the nation's leader.</i>

24:53.061 --> 24:57.315
<i>And in you, sir,</i>
<i>I see a brave man.</i>

24:57.315 --> 24:59.150
<i>A just man.</i>

24:59.150 --> 25:01.652
<i>A president whom</i>
<i>I would follow anywhere,</i>

25:01.652 --> 25:05.948
<i>no matter how strong</i>
<i>the wind blows against us.</i>

25:10.452 --> 25:14.080
<i>I want to tell you something</i>
<i>I have never told anyone.</i>

25:14.080 --> 25:17.834
<i>When I was 13, I walked in</i>
<i>on my father in the barn.</i>

25:17.834 --> 25:20.878
<i>There was a shotgun</i>
<i>in his mouth.</i>

25:20.878 --> 25:23.714
<i>He waved me over.</i>
<i>"Come here, Francis," he said.</i>

25:23.714 --> 25:26.758
"Pull the trigger for me."

25:26.758 --> 25:29.803
Because he didn't have the
courage to do it himself.

25:29.803 --> 25:34.015
I said, "No, Pop," and walked out, knowing
he would never find that courage.

25:34.015 --> 25:36.684
<i>The next seven years</i>
<i>were hell for my father,</i>

25:36.684 --> 25:39.687
<i>but even more hell</i>
<i>for my mother and me.</i>

25:39.687 --> 25:45.025
<i>He made all of us miserable,</i>
<i>drinking, despair, violence.</i>

25:45.025 --> 25:47.402
<i>My only regret in life</i>

25:47.402 --> 25:49.988
<i>is that I didn't</i>
<i>pull that trigger.</i>

25:49.988 --> 25:51.906
<i>He would've been</i>
<i>better off in the grave,</i>

25:51.906 --> 25:54.492
<i>and we would have been</i>
<i>better off without him.</i>

25:54.492 --> 25:56.619
<i>I'm not going to put you</i>
<i>in the same position</i>

25:56.619 --> 25:58.579
<i>as my father put me in.</i>

25:58.579 --> 26:02.791
<i>You will find enclosed,</i>
<i>on a separate sheet,</i>

26:02.791 --> 26:05.794
<i>a confession to the crimes</i>
<i>you have been accused of.</i>

26:05.794 --> 26:10.340
<i>They're false words, but my signature</i>
<i>will make them true.</i>

26:10.340 --> 26:13.760
<i>Use them if you must.</i>

26:13.760 --> 26:17.472
<i>If you truly believe</i>
<i>that I have only served myself,</i>

26:17.472 --> 26:20.224
<i>then I have forever</i>
<i>lost your trust.</i>

26:20.224 --> 26:26.188
<i>All I can do now is give you</i>
<i>my freedom to save your own.</i>

26:26.188 --> 26:28.357
<i>I said I would</i>
<i>take the fall for you,</i>

26:28.357 --> 26:31.985
<i>and now I give you the means</i>
<i>to make that happen.</i>

26:31.985 --> 26:35.446
<i>I am pulling the trigger myself.</i>

26:35.446 --> 26:39.033
<i>We all must make sacrifices</i>
<i>to achieve our dreams.</i>

26:39.033 --> 26:42.870
<i>But sometimes we must sacrifice</i>
<i>ourselves for the greater good.</i>

26:42.870 --> 26:46.707
It is my honor to make
such a sacrifice now.

26:46.707 --> 26:50.335
Your loyal friend, still in my
heart, if not in yours...

26:50.335 --> 26:53.213
<i>...Francis.</i>

27:01.428 --> 27:04.431
The Constitution sets forth
the general principle...

27:04.431 --> 27:07.059
Sir, the president's
on the phone.

27:21.405 --> 27:24.950
- Mr. President.
<i>- I got your letter.</i>

27:24.950 --> 27:28.036
I had Tricia read it too.

27:29.496 --> 27:31.498
<i>I'm torn, Frank.</i>

27:31.498 --> 27:33.625
<i>Half of me wants to think</i>
<i>you're genuine.</i>

27:33.625 --> 27:36.878
The other half
doesn't trust a word of it.

27:36.878 --> 27:38.838
<i>Does Tricia feel the same way?</i>

27:38.838 --> 27:42.883
She believes in Claire,
which inclines her to believe in you.

27:42.883 --> 27:44.927
I meant every syllable.

27:44.927 --> 27:47.179
I wanted you to know
beyond a shadow of a doubt

27:47.179 --> 27:50.807
that I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary.

27:50.807 --> 27:53.852
Then why can't
I shake the shadow?

27:53.852 --> 27:56.896
<i>Because I'm a liar, sir.</i>

27:56.896 --> 28:00.691
Because I lack scruples and some
would even say compassion.

28:00.691 --> 28:03.652
But that's just the image
that I present to the world

28:03.652 --> 28:08.156
<i>because it elicits fear and respect.</i>
<i>But it is not who I am.</i>

28:08.156 --> 28:13.495
My hope was that my letter
would prove that to you.

28:14.913 --> 28:16.998
Even if you are being genuine,

28:16.998 --> 28:20.209
that doesn't do much for me.

28:20.209 --> 28:24.046
I won't survive impeachment because
I got along with my vice president.

28:24.046 --> 28:28.717
No, I agree you need more
than my good intentions.

28:28.717 --> 28:32.345
Proof, that's what
I want to see, Frank.

28:32.345 --> 28:37.100
Not just falling on the sword.
Show me results,

28:37.100 --> 28:39.935
and then I'll reconsider whether
you're worth any of my trust at all.

28:39.977 --> 28:44.398
- You're talking votes.
<i>- Whipping votes is your strong suit.</i>

28:44.398 --> 28:46.858
<i>That's the side</i>
<i>of you I want to see.</i>

28:46.858 --> 28:49.778
- I've already begun, sir.
- You have a count?

28:49.778 --> 28:52.155
<i>An approximation,</i>
<i>the sands keep shifting.</i>

28:52.197 --> 28:55.783
- Can we survive the House or not?
- Possibly. But Jackie Sharp

28:55.783 --> 28:58.411
- is making it very difficult.
- <i> Give me numbers.</i>

28:58.411 --> 29:00.538
Over half of the 18
that she needs,

29:00.538 --> 29:03.415
which is why I'd like to start
focusing on the Senate.

29:03.415 --> 29:06.418
- Don't you think that's premature?
- <i> We should be prepared.</i>

29:06.460 --> 29:10.005
The key battle is making sure
that you avoid conviction.

29:11.673 --> 29:13.550
You keep whipping,

29:13.550 --> 29:17.470
you keep getting me information,
I'll answer your calls.

29:17.470 --> 29:21.140
But don't take that as a sign
of reconciliation, Frank.

29:21.140 --> 29:26.228
I'll sing for my supper, sir.
I don't expect it for free.

29:26.228 --> 29:32.108
<i>- Let's talk again tomorrow.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. President.

29:32.108 --> 29:34.944
- You said you wanted options.
- Frank didn't leave me options.

29:34.944 --> 29:37.989
- He fucked me. - You fucked him first,
when you sided with Tusk.

29:37.989 --> 29:39.865
But who cares what
happened each inning?

29:39.865 --> 29:42.034
It's the final
score that counts.

29:42.034 --> 29:45.829
Eight years I spent
busting my ass in this office,

29:45.829 --> 29:48.874
- I can't seem to escape it.
- Are you going to help us or not?

29:48.874 --> 29:51.251
- I need to know what I gain.
- You'll be taken care of.

29:51.251 --> 29:53.336
Specifically.

29:53.336 --> 29:56.839
We'll see what makes sense
when all the chips have fallen.

29:56.839 --> 30:00.051
So you just want me to leap off a cliff
and hope for a soft landing beneath?

30:00.051 --> 30:02.886
No one will touch you now.
Nobody except us.

30:02.886 --> 30:04.638
We're as soft
as you're going to get.

30:04.638 --> 30:10.060
- A job at the White House?
- No promises.

30:10.060 --> 30:15.023
Other than something commensurate
with your loyalty and experience.

30:15.023 --> 30:17.859
I could just walk away
from it all, start a new life.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.861
No, you can't.
You know you can't.

30:20.861 --> 30:23.364
You'd wither away anywhere
but the Hill.

30:23.364 --> 30:25.991
It's never been about the money,
no matter what you tell yourself.

30:26.033 --> 30:30.078
When I left,
Frank begged me to stay.

30:30.078 --> 30:34.707
Power vs. money, he said.
Don't reduce myself to a tax bracket.

30:34.707 --> 30:37.460
He was right.
And I doubt he begged.

30:37.460 --> 30:41.922
He was half right. Power is better
than money, for as long as it lasts.

30:41.922 --> 30:46.843
- But it never lasts.
- What's your answer?

30:53.766 --> 30:56.602
You've gotten colder since
you've taken over this job.

30:59.313 --> 31:01.565
It makes things easier.

31:01.565 --> 31:06.195
- On the outside.
- And the inside.

31:08.864 --> 31:10.490
I miss you, Jackie.

31:13.243 --> 31:15.828
Tell me if you'll cooperate.

31:22.251 --> 31:24.294
Excuse me one second.

31:25.170 --> 31:27.005
Mr. President?

31:27.005 --> 31:30.050
<i>I want you to call</i>
<i>Tusk. Tell him the deal is off.</i>

31:30.050 --> 31:31.509
- What?
- <i> You were right.</i>

31:31.509 --> 31:33.428
I don't want to take the risk.

31:33.428 --> 31:35.305
<i>But I already spoke to him.</i>

31:35.305 --> 31:37.223
Well, so speak to him again,
and tell him there's no pardon.

31:37.223 --> 31:40.976
Sir, I was skeptical
of this strategy at first,

31:40.976 --> 31:43.729
but now that we've gone down
this road, we should stick to it.

31:43.729 --> 31:46.190
<i>Linda, do you</i>
<i>still want your job back?</i>

31:46.190 --> 31:50.110
- Of course, sir.
- Then make the call.

31:53.363 --> 31:58.284
I'd rather see what happens in the House
before I get involved in any way.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.911
But if you come out vigorously
in defense of the president,

32:00.911 --> 32:02.454
it might convince
the judiciary committee...

32:02.454 --> 32:04.456
To be honest, I'm not
particularly inclined

32:04.456 --> 32:06.458
to be doing Walker any favors.

32:06.458 --> 32:10.253
Now, Michael, I know
he revoked your nomination.

32:10.253 --> 32:13.047
- He didn't fight for me at all.
- He had just been elected.

32:13.047 --> 32:16.467
- He wasn't in a position...
- Wrong. He had a clear mandate.

32:16.467 --> 32:18.636
He was in a strong position
to defend me.

32:20.096 --> 32:22.890
You're right.
If I'd been president,

32:22.890 --> 32:24.767
I wouldn't have
given in so easily.

32:24.767 --> 32:27.811
I would've stuck by you after
that article came to light.

32:27.811 --> 32:31.356
In fact, if you'd been our secretary
of state instead of Durant,

32:31.356 --> 32:33.274
I don't think we'd be
in the mess we are with China.

32:33.274 --> 32:35.860
The truth is I wouldn't have
nominated you

32:35.860 --> 32:37.487
for secretary of state
in the first place.

32:37.487 --> 32:38.654
I would have nominated you

32:38.654 --> 32:39.947
for secretary of treasury.

32:39.947 --> 32:41.740
Because your expertise
in economics

32:41.740 --> 32:43.867
is even better than your grasp
on foreign affairs.

32:43.867 --> 32:47.871
Now, if I were president,
you'd be secretary of treasury.

32:49.122 --> 32:54.460
- If you were president.
- That's right.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.963
You can't do this.

32:58.005 --> 33:00.091
What happened?

33:02.760 --> 33:04.970
Was it Frank?

33:06.972 --> 33:09.141
Linda, listen to me...

33:13.436 --> 33:15.688
I understand.

33:15.688 --> 33:18.733
Thanks.

33:18.733 --> 33:21.527
- The deal is off.
- Did she say why?

33:21.527 --> 33:25.239
No. Other than
he changed his mind.

33:25.239 --> 33:27.074
But it must be Frank.

33:27.074 --> 33:29.659
- Then we go back to the original plan.
- That's right.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.245
You plead the Fifth, just like you
did before. This is political theater.

33:32.245 --> 33:33.830
- We get past it and focus...
- Jesus Christ.

33:33.830 --> 33:36.457
- What is it?
- Remy Danton is volunteering

33:36.457 --> 33:38.668
to testify to Dunbar, right now.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.753
He volunteered?
He wasn't subpoenaed?

33:40.753 --> 33:44.131
- Looks that way.
- He's going to sell me out.

33:44.131 --> 33:47.467
That would open
him up to prosecution.

33:47.467 --> 33:50.303
Unless he's being protected.

33:54.933 --> 34:00.021
- Where's Danton?
- I'll call his assistant.

34:02.106 --> 34:05.359
Did you or did you not
facilitate foreign money

34:05.359 --> 34:10.030
being funneled into
political action committees?

34:10.030 --> 34:15.409
On the advice of my counsel, I reserve
my right to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

34:15.409 --> 34:19.288
Xander Feng claims you not only
facilitated, you orchestrated the scheme.

34:19.288 --> 34:23.458
What is your response
to that testimony?

34:23.458 --> 34:27.295
On the advice of my counsel,
I reserve my right...

34:27.295 --> 34:30.130
You can reserve your right
all day long, Mr. Tusk.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.509
But when you appear
in front of a grand jury,

34:32.509 --> 34:35.136
as I'm sure the
justice department intends,

34:35.136 --> 34:37.221
your silence will
be your downfall.

34:37.221 --> 34:38.514
Does the Congressman
have a question?

34:38.514 --> 34:41.183
You can hide from us all
you want, sir,

34:41.183 --> 34:43.643
you cannot hide
from a jury of your peers.

34:43.643 --> 34:45.687
- Mr. Chairman.
- That's it. I'm done.

34:45.687 --> 34:48.774
I relinquish
the remainder of my time.

34:48.774 --> 34:53.069
The chair recognizes the congresswoman
from Tennessee. You have 12 minutes, ma'am.

34:53.069 --> 34:57.240
Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently
embroiled in a trade war with China.

34:57.240 --> 35:00.076
It has gutted our economy.

35:00.076 --> 35:02.911
It has placed our Navy
in harm's way.

35:02.911 --> 35:05.455
- The president who put us there has...
- He knew.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.586
- Excuse me?
- My client reserves the...

35:11.586 --> 35:14.214
He knew. Isn't that what
you're all wondering?

35:15.923 --> 35:21.053
- Quiet, please.
- Knew what, exactly?

35:21.053 --> 35:25.933
There was a mechanism by which
a great many contributions were made

35:25.933 --> 35:29.895
over the last ten years.
The legality of this mechanism

35:29.895 --> 35:35.358
is something I continue to believe
is within the boundaries of the law.

35:37.944 --> 35:41.572
<i>But as for the mechanism itself, Mr.
Feng is correct.</i>

35:41.572 --> 35:46.952
<i>I orchestrated it, I facilitated it,
and the President knew about it.</i>

35:46.952 --> 35:49.371
Danton just cancelled.

35:49.371 --> 35:53.374
Screw Danton. We've got Tusk.

35:53.374 --> 35:55.668
Get me the attorney general.

36:03.092 --> 36:06.762
That won't be necessary, Mr.
Tusk, if you'll come with us.

36:06.762 --> 36:10.765
That's a shame. Handcuffs were
another item on my bucket list.

36:10.765 --> 36:13.893
Right this way, sir. You have
the right to remain silent.

36:13.893 --> 36:15.978
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

36:15.978 --> 36:19.815
We'll want a bond,
for his cooperation in the hearing.

36:19.815 --> 36:22.443
I'll talk bonds
if you'll talk a plea.

36:22.443 --> 36:25.821
<i>Response to the testimony</i>
<i>has been swift and vocal.</i>

36:25.821 --> 36:29.199
<i>Protesters have been gathering in
front of the White House since yesterday</i>

36:29.199 --> 36:31.826
<i>demanding President</i>
<i>Walker's resignation.</i>

36:31.826 --> 36:36.372
<i>And an online petition has already
accumulate over 200,000 signatures</i>

36:36.372 --> 36:37.957
<i>in the past 24 hours.</i>

36:37.957 --> 36:40.418
<i>The list of lawmakers</i>
<i>publicly condemning</i>

36:40.418 --> 36:42.878
<i>the president has grown</i>
<i>on both sides of the aisle.</i>

36:42.878 --> 36:45.672
<i>This afternoon, the Chinese</i>
<i>ambassador also condemned</i>

36:45.672 --> 36:48.175
<i>the Walker administration,</i>
<i>saying China would not</i>

36:48.175 --> 36:50.343
<i>negotiate with a president</i>
<i>who dealt</i>

36:50.343 --> 36:52.846
<i>with corrupt businessmen</i>
<i>behind Beijing's back.</i>

36:52.846 --> 36:55.098
<i>This at a time when warships</i>
<i>from both countries...</i>

36:55.098 --> 36:58.684
<i>Meanwhile, the president and First Lady
remain bunkered at Camp David,</i>

36:58.684 --> 37:02.813
<i>and have offered no public response to the
most recent developments in Washington.</i>

37:02.813 --> 37:04.982
<i>I'm here with Ayla Sayyad</i>
<i>of the</i> Wall Street Telegraph.

37:04.982 --> 37:08.777
<i>I have to begin by saying</i>
<i>that sources on the Hill are telling me</i>

37:08.777 --> 37:12.238
<i>that the Judiciary Committee</i>
<i>may bypass debate altogether.</i>

37:12.238 --> 37:14.574
<i>No one on the committee has</i>
<i>gone on record about that.</i>

37:14.574 --> 37:17.160
<i>But do you think these rumors would be
circulating if there weren't some sort</i>

37:17.160 --> 37:20.454
<i>of strong preference to recommend the
articles of impeachment to the House?</i>

37:20.454 --> 37:23.040
<i>I think it's safe to assume</i>
<i>there is strong support.</i>

37:23.040 --> 37:26.168
<i>Every poll I've seen shows
an overwhelming majority of Americans</i>

37:26.168 --> 37:29.004
<i>want this to move forward. I don't think
politicians are going to ignore that.</i>

37:29.004 --> 37:31.965
I've talked to a number
of my colleagues already.

37:31.965 --> 37:34.050
There is support on my side
of the aisle.

37:34.050 --> 37:36.969
- How many do you have?
- Five at this point, including me.

37:36.969 --> 37:39.764
That would put us at 60.
We'd still need seven more.

37:39.764 --> 37:44.018
You've seen the overnight polls.
He's dipped down into the single digits.

37:44.018 --> 37:46.645
Are you willing to make
a public statement with us?

37:46.645 --> 37:51.733
I think the country could use a little
bipartisanship right now, don't you?

37:51.733 --> 37:53.026
<i>Do you think they're bluffing?</i>

37:54.027 --> 37:55.903
That it's some sort of stunt

37:55.903 --> 37:58.739
to sway the undecideds
in the Senate?

37:58.739 --> 38:01.450
Michael Kern is bitter
and small-minded, sir,

38:01.450 --> 38:05.037
but he wouldn't have appeared publicly with
Mendoza if they didn't have the numbers.

38:05.037 --> 38:07.289
<i>I imagine we're worse off in</i>
<i>the House than we were before.</i>

38:07.289 --> 38:10.458
In fact, I had a very productive
conversation with Jackie Sharp.

38:10.458 --> 38:13.253
<i>She agreed to stop the attack</i>
<i>if we give her our support</i>

38:13.294 --> 38:17.256
for majority leader after the midterms,
but once Raymond gave his testimony,

38:17.256 --> 38:18.883
she called to say
the deal was off.

38:18.883 --> 38:21.677
Raymond really has set us back.

38:21.677 --> 38:25.597
<i>- I can't fathom why he lied.</i>
- It's retribution.

38:25.597 --> 38:29.518
- For what? The energy crisis?
- <i> No.</i>

38:31.436 --> 38:35.440
Did you offer him something?

38:35.440 --> 38:38.234
Well, Raymond's testimony hurts,
but it can't finish us off.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.236
It's impossible to prove a lie.

38:40.236 --> 38:42.821
Impeachment is inevitable.

38:42.821 --> 38:47.034
Public opinion is the adversary
now. Facts no longer matter.

38:47.034 --> 38:50.662
You should give Kern a call.
The personal touch.

38:50.662 --> 38:54.582
If he came back to us, it might make
the other Democrats get cold feet.

38:54.582 --> 39:00.254
China isn't helping. President Qian won't
return my calls. Beijing must smell death.

39:00.254 --> 39:03.090
They're just exploiting
the situation for leverage.

39:03.090 --> 39:07.511
Let's not worry about China for the moment.
One battle at a time, sir.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.430
<i>Maybe I'm finished, Frank.</i>

39:10.430 --> 39:13.641
Maybe I need to start accepting
that we won't pull out of this.

39:13.641 --> 39:18.020
<i>Mr. President, I know you're tired. I know</i>
<i>this has been hell for you.</i>

39:18.020 --> 39:20.981
And yes, impeachment
would be an awful blow.

39:20.981 --> 39:23.484
We'd have to fight tooth
and nail in the Senate.

39:23.484 --> 39:28.280
And yes, we'll have to beg and
compromise to regain our political capital.

39:28.280 --> 39:33.660
But we have it in us, sir, no matter
how many scars it leaves us with.

39:33.660 --> 39:35.870
It's not just us, Frank.

39:35.870 --> 39:39.123
It's Tricia, it's my children.

39:39.123 --> 39:44.545
I stay awake at night thinking
how much it would crush them,

39:44.545 --> 39:46.672
seeing their father hauled off.

39:46.672 --> 39:49.257
Sir, that won't happen,
because I won't let it.

39:49.257 --> 39:53.052
If we're confronted by the worst, I'll make
sure you never step foot behind bars.

39:53.052 --> 39:55.805
<i>You have my word on that.</i>

39:58.015 --> 40:02.269
He's in the darkness now.
And I'm the only beacon of light.

40:02.269 --> 40:05.856
Now we gently guide him
toward the rocks.

40:05.856 --> 40:09.276
Mr. President,
you also still have my letter.

40:09.276 --> 40:12.070
<i>It's not too late,</i>
<i>if you want to use that option.</i>

40:12.070 --> 40:15.907
You're more useful to me
on the Hill than in handcuffs.

40:15.907 --> 40:21.078
I'll call Kern.
<i>- Good night, sir.</i>

40:51.606 --> 40:56.277
- How much did Green tell you?
- Enough that I showed up.

40:56.277 --> 40:59.864
He probably didn't
mention Rachel Posner.

40:59.864 --> 41:03.492
Don't worry, he doesn't know.

41:03.492 --> 41:05.994
I do.

41:05.994 --> 41:09.206
You have her in an
apartment in Joppa.

41:09.206 --> 41:12.667
I have your movements,
I have your text messages,

41:12.667 --> 41:16.337
before you destroyed your phone,
but that's more than enough.

41:16.337 --> 41:21.926
I'll bet a lot of people would
like to know what she knows.

41:21.926 --> 41:25.012
Now you listen
to me very carefully.

41:25.053 --> 41:30.100
Whatever you think you've got,
whatever you intend to do with it,

41:30.100 --> 41:34.229
I don't respond to extortion
the same way that Green does.

41:34.229 --> 41:37.523
What Green promised you...

41:37.523 --> 41:40.526
...it can be undone
in a heartbeat.

41:40.526 --> 41:43.445
That's why you're here,
to make sure it isn't.

41:47.407 --> 41:49.326
You want my protection.

41:49.326 --> 41:52.579
I don't trust Green,
or anyone at the bureau.

41:56.207 --> 42:01.879
- Who else knows about this?
- No one.

42:04.798 --> 42:06.174
Why should I trust you?

42:07.467 --> 42:10.720
'Cause we both
have too much to lose, man.

42:33.074 --> 42:35.368
Get dressed.

42:35.368 --> 42:39.288
- What are you doing here?
- Put some clothes on.

42:40.539 --> 42:43.959
- Why?
- Now. Let's go.

42:48.713 --> 42:52.133
Did anyone contact you?

42:52.133 --> 42:55.678
- Where are you taking me?
- Answer my question.

42:56.846 --> 42:59.223
No, nobody.

43:01.934 --> 43:04.770
There's someone
who knows about us,

43:04.770 --> 43:07.189
who knows where you are,

43:07.189 --> 43:09.399
and when we've met.

43:12.735 --> 43:15.822
Are you gonna hurt me?

43:15.822 --> 43:18.699
Nothing's going to happen
if you tell the truth.

43:18.699 --> 43:22.202
I am. I haven't been
contacted by anybody.

43:23.829 --> 43:26.123
Stop lying, Rachel.

43:27.833 --> 43:30.335
I will do whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt me...

43:30.335 --> 43:33.963
What I want is for you to answer
my questions, so I can help you.

43:33.963 --> 43:36.632
All you have ever done
is fuck up my life!

43:36.674 --> 43:39.051
You fucked up the Fellowship.
You fucked up what I had with Lisa!

43:39.051 --> 43:40.928
Even when I did what you asked!

43:40.928 --> 43:45.098
Your sick fucking visits and
reading to you like a fucking child!

43:45.098 --> 43:47.434
What is wrong with you?!

43:47.434 --> 43:50.395
Why can't you just leave me be?!
Why do you have to be such a fucking...

43:50.395 --> 43:52.564
Stop!

44:34.644 --> 44:38.397
Rachel? Don't be stupid.

44:47.698 --> 44:52.494
Rachel, everything's
going to be fine.

44:58.624 --> 45:01.669
All I've ever done
is try to protect you,

45:01.669 --> 45:03.921
what I'm trying to do now.

45:05.547 --> 45:08.425
You have to believe that.

45:08.425 --> 45:11.011
I didn't have to.

45:11.011 --> 45:13.555
It would've been a lot
easier if I didn't.

45:16.516 --> 45:19.977
But I did. I did it,
because I...

45:26.275 --> 45:28.068
What are you doing?

45:30.070 --> 45:32.697
- Uh!
- Oof!

45:49.838 --> 45:53.341
Yesterday we completed hearings with
regard to articles of impeachment

45:53.341 --> 45:55.468
for the president
of the United States.

45:55.468 --> 45:58.429
The chair will now entertain
motions from the committee.

45:58.471 --> 46:02.808
- Mr. Chairman. - The chair recognizes
the congressman from Alabama.

46:02.808 --> 46:06.144
I move that we put our
recommendation directly to a vote,

46:06.144 --> 46:10.357
so that debate on this important
matter may take place on the House floor,

46:10.357 --> 46:13.651
open to all 435 members.

46:13.651 --> 46:19.115
Are there any objections
to bypassing debate in this committee?

46:19.115 --> 46:21.158
We will now vote
on recommendation of the

46:21.158 --> 46:23.494
articles of impeachment
to the full House.

46:23.494 --> 46:26.163
Those in favor of
recommendation say "aye."

46:26.163 --> 46:28.373
- Aye.
- Those opposed?

46:28.373 --> 46:31.167
- Nay.
- The "ayes" have it.

46:31.167 --> 46:34.295
This committee officially
recommends articles of impeachment

46:34.295 --> 46:37.048
proceed to the House floor.

46:55.940 --> 46:57.984
He's here.

47:26.593 --> 47:30.680
<i>The vice president is just arriving now</i>
<i>here at Camp David.</i>

47:30.680 --> 47:33.683
<i>We expect President Walker</i>
<i>to speak within the hour,</i>

47:33.683 --> 47:38.521
<i>announcing his official resignation
as president of the United States.</i>

47:52.075 --> 47:55.078
- How are you?
- All right.

47:57.788 --> 47:59.999
Mr. President.

47:59.999 --> 48:03.085
I have coffee in the kitchen.
Would you like some?

48:03.085 --> 48:04.962
I'm fine.

48:13.178 --> 48:18.641
Well, you're about to become the
most powerful man in the free world.

48:18.641 --> 48:23.228
- You don't have to do this, sir.
- I spoke to Kern last night.

48:23.228 --> 48:27.399
- He's not going to back down.
- So we'll beat him down.

48:27.399 --> 48:30.860
No, Frank. My approvals
are at eight percent.

48:30.860 --> 48:34.405
Even if I avoid conviction,
I have no mandate to lead, so...

48:34.405 --> 48:39.201
...better I step aside with some dignity
so the nation can start to heal.

48:45.332 --> 48:48.251
I can never fill
your shoes, sir.

48:51.338 --> 48:53.590
You don't have a choice now.

49:02.181 --> 49:04.224
Your letter.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.901
Well...

49:14.901 --> 49:19.113
...shall we go introduce the
46th president of the United States?

49:35.503 --> 49:41.133
Effective immediately, I am resigning
the presidency of the United States.

49:41.133 --> 49:45.512
Tricia and I believe that this
is the best course of action,

49:45.512 --> 49:48.765
not only for us
and our children,

49:48.765 --> 49:50.850
but for country.

49:50.850 --> 49:54.270
It's a sad day for us.
I can't deny that.

49:54.270 --> 49:57.064
But I take solace in this:

49:57.064 --> 50:02.486
Frank Underwood will bring
virtue, experience and courage

50:02.486 --> 50:04.446
to the Oval Office.

50:04.446 --> 50:07.491
I have been blessed to have him
as my vice president.

50:07.491 --> 50:10.910
But I'm even more blessed
to call him my friend.

50:13.329 --> 50:16.833
It has been...

50:16.833 --> 50:23.088
...the greatest honor of my life to serve
this country as president.

50:23.088 --> 50:26.383
I thank my family, my staff,

50:26.383 --> 50:29.678
and all of those
who have supported me.

50:29.678 --> 50:31.846
Despite the last few months,

50:31.846 --> 50:36.684
my faith in this country
has never been stronger.

50:36.684 --> 50:38.477
God bless all of you.

50:38.477 --> 50:41.981
And God bless
the United States of America.

50:44.066 --> 50:46.526
Thank you, Mr. President.

51:00.414 --> 51:05.419
Sir, please raise your
right hand and repeat after me.

51:05.419 --> 51:10.507
- "I, Francis J. Underwood..."
- I, Francis J. Underwood...

51:10.507 --> 51:14.219
- "...do solemnly swear..."
- ...do solemnly swear...

51:15.970 --> 51:19.098
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

51:19.098 --> 51:20.975
Madame Secretary.

51:20.975 --> 51:23.435
The rest of the cabinet
is awaiting you at the White House.

51:23.435 --> 51:25.896
We'd like to give you a national
security briefing right away, sir.

51:25.896 --> 51:28.899
I'm aware of the particulars.
Please get Beijing on the phone.

51:28.899 --> 51:32.569
Qian hasn't returned the
president's calls for two days.

51:33.903 --> 51:36.114
Well, there's
a new president now.

51:36.155 --> 51:39.617
Please get him on the line.

51:39.617 --> 51:44.413
Two hours ago, President Underwood,
in his first act as commander in chief,

51:44.413 --> 51:47.666
gave orders to the Seventh Fleet
to vacate Japanese waters.

51:47.666 --> 51:51.461
This was a result of a productive
conversation with President Qian,

51:51.461 --> 51:55.173
who gave similar orders to Chinese
naval vessels in the same region.

51:55.173 --> 51:59.218
- He moves quick. - Do you mean
with the Chinese, or with Walker?

51:59.218 --> 52:02.471
<i>After a grueling night, the four
exiles make their way...</i>

52:04.014 --> 52:05.557
- Mr. Feng?
- What is it?

52:05.557 --> 52:06.767
US Justice Department.

52:06.767 --> 52:08.518
We need you to come with us.

52:08.518 --> 52:11.396
- Where?
- You're going back to China.

52:11.396 --> 52:13.356
- I have asylum.
- No, sir, you don't.

52:13.356 --> 52:15.233
Your asylum has been rescinded.

52:15.233 --> 52:17.735
I have it in writing.
Unconditional and permanent.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.403
Sir, I'm telling you,

52:19.403 --> 52:21.947
your asylum has been rescinded.
Now, please,

52:21.947 --> 52:25.033
gather your things
and come with us.

52:27.035 --> 52:29.871
Revoking his asylum
will have consequences.

52:29.871 --> 52:31.831
But we're solid
from a legal perspective.

52:31.831 --> 52:35.793
Legally, yes. His initial paperwork
hasn't been processed,

52:35.793 --> 52:38.879
and we can claim he poses
a threat to our national interests.

52:38.879 --> 52:41.674
But it diminishes the integrity
of our State Department.

52:41.674 --> 52:46.345
What's more important, Cathy,
integrity or peace?

52:46.345 --> 52:50.640
- You know they'll execute him.
- The Chinese are right about one thing:

52:50.640 --> 52:54.185
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
the one for the many.

52:54.185 --> 52:56.062
Let's get back to Washington.

53:06.446 --> 53:09.157
OK, please let me know.
Thanks very much.

53:09.157 --> 53:11.034
- Anything?
- Not yet.

53:11.034 --> 53:13.161
See if you can track down anyone
from his regular AA meetings.

53:13.161 --> 53:15.330
I spoke to the moderator,
he says he hasn't seen

53:15.330 --> 53:18.749
Doug in several weeks. I checked all
the hospitals, his landlord...

53:18.749 --> 53:21.669
- Sir, everyone's here.
- When this is all over,

53:21.669 --> 53:23.253
I want you to work with
Nancy on finding Doug.

53:23.253 --> 53:25.172
I've already alerted
the DC Metro.

53:25.172 --> 53:27.799
- They put out an APB on his car.
- We'll find him, sir.

53:27.799 --> 53:29.801
- Claire?
- Just outside.

53:29.801 --> 53:31.636
Let's go, Nancy.

53:40.811 --> 53:45.983
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President and the First Lady.

54:31.649 --> 54:34.110
Francis.

54:34.110 --> 54:36.904
I know your birthday
isn't for a couple of weeks,

54:36.904 --> 54:39.073
- but I got you something.
- What's this?

54:39.073 --> 54:40.991
Open it.

54:47.914 --> 54:50.500
I had a new one made.

54:52.669 --> 54:56.589
- I love you.
- I love you too.

54:57.965 --> 55:00.968
- You go ahead.
- Come on.

55:00.968 --> 55:02.761
We earned this together.

55:02.761 --> 55:05.889
Take a few moments
for yourself first.

55:06.014 --> 55:08.225
I'll be out here.
