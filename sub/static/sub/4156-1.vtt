03:08.916 --> 03:10.543
Fuck!

03:33.407 --> 03:35.468
Can we turn this down?

03:36.043 --> 03:37.903
I mean...

03:38.749 --> 03:41.444
I only want a little bit of music.

03:49.193 --> 03:51.328
How do you do that?

03:51.428 --> 03:53.632
- Do what?
- Read in the car.

03:54.132 --> 03:56.902
I get carsick as shit, you know?

03:57.402 --> 03:59.771
Start getting all queasy,
burps start smelling weird.

03:59.871 --> 04:02.474
And I'm puking projectile vomit.
It'll be violent.

04:02.774 --> 04:05.854
You know what I mean? Like...
Like, I'm eating it back into my mouth.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.492
Can't see. It splatters everywhere.
Little piece gets in your eye.

04:09.592 --> 04:12.884
You're like, "Ah!" So you open your mouth.
And it gets in your mouth and then...

04:12.984 --> 04:16.921
You're gagging, you're vomiting all over
the place. And I crash into a tree.

04:17.021 --> 04:22.384
Could you please stop? I'm gonna finish
working on my checklist, you know.

04:23.527 --> 04:25.988
Did you bring the wine glasses?

04:26.997 --> 04:28.867
Yeah.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.328
I'm gonna double-check.

04:36.005 --> 04:38.510
- It's okay. Oh, my God.
- Really? Really?

04:38.610 --> 04:41.012
We're okay. Let me help.
There's a towel around here.

04:41.112 --> 04:43.431
No. It's everywhere.

04:43.531 --> 04:47.443
- Who paved this fucking road?
- Is that a rhetorical question?

05:10.141 --> 05:14.012
Could you try not to hit, you know
all the potholes and/or gardeners?

05:14.112 --> 05:16.338
You seem a little anxious.

05:17.115 --> 05:20.819
I am. I mean, I'm running
this business now.

05:21.219 --> 05:25.026
If I fail the business fails. If the business
fails, then I don't make money.

05:25.126 --> 05:27.867
And If can't make money,
I can't pay you. You know?

05:27.967 --> 05:30.528
It's all I know how to do is parties
and if I can't do parties then...

05:30.628 --> 05:33.349
what does that say about me?

05:33.630 --> 05:35.733
I mean... I... It's...

05:35.833 --> 05:38.888
I don't know. I mean, it sounds
like you were born to party.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.430
I mean, not like, you...

05:42.530 --> 05:45.410
party, but like party, like cater.
You were born to cater, you know?

05:45.710 --> 05:48.795
Do you smoke weed? I think weed
would be great. If I was a doctor...

05:48.895 --> 05:49.901
- Paul.
- Yeah.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.384
Just stop. Just stop.

05:52.484 --> 05:56.539
Really? I thought maybe we were
communicating there. So, I'm...

05:56.919 --> 05:59.074
Yeah. No.

06:24.031 --> 06:25.751
Phone.

06:26.383 --> 06:28.070
What?

06:28.585 --> 06:30.922
I'm not a child. I know
not to use my phone while I work.

06:31.022 --> 06:32.183
Why do I have to give it to you?

06:32.283 --> 06:35.945
I don't want the guests seeing you
searching for a signal like an idiot.

06:37.461 --> 06:39.882
There is no winning with you.

06:41.331 --> 06:43.019
Yeah.

06:55.045 --> 06:57.900
- Careful!
- I know, I know.

06:59.082 --> 07:02.487
Please don't fuck this up.
This year's been hard enough as it is.

07:02.587 --> 07:04.755
I know. I know.

07:04.855 --> 07:08.359
Yeah, I'm... Yeah, I mean...
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:08.459 --> 07:10.146
It's gonna be perfect.

07:17.634 --> 07:22.025
- This place is a piece of shit.
- You'll see it has its charms.

07:22.939 --> 07:25.710
You're not gonna wear that shirt, are you?

07:25.810 --> 07:28.646
Everything's gonna be okay.
Alright? Just relax.

07:29.346 --> 07:31.000
Flora!

07:31.949 --> 07:33.948
<i>Cรณmo estรกs?</i>

07:34.048 --> 07:36.054
Julia! Darling.

07:36.154 --> 07:39.315
So good to see you.

08:00.644 --> 08:03.047
Sounds alright to you?

08:03.147 --> 08:04.782
Sounds damn good to me.

08:04.882 --> 08:07.822
I'm Lawrence. Tonight's entertainment.
Friends call me Larry.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.731
Bartender Paul. Friends call me Paul.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.199
Well, Paul, you seem awfully glum
on such a fine afternoon.

08:15.299 --> 08:17.672
There's something I can play
to cheer up your spirits?

08:17.982 --> 08:20.184
I don't... I don't know,
why don't you surprise me?

08:20.334 --> 08:23.255
- Do you know anything in the key of G?
- G like Greats?

08:23.355 --> 08:26.376
G like Great. That's funny. Clever. Larry.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.061
Paul.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.500
Yeah.

08:45.225 --> 08:49.229
You'd think I'd outgrow
the onion cries, right?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.974
Dad was always on chopping duty.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.447
I heard about your father.

09:15.547 --> 09:17.810
I'm sorry, Julia.

09:19.659 --> 09:22.529
It's been tough, I'm just...

09:24.364 --> 09:27.601
trying to hold everything together.

09:27.701 --> 09:32.205
But you're just as good
as he was. Better, even.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.775
Everything will work out.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.966
Oh, God.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.172
Come on.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.675
Jesus.

09:54.295 --> 09:55.948
Fuck.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.649
He likes you.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.103
Yeah. No.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.625
I'm pretty sure
I'd rather jump off a cliff.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.826
Hey, there. Put you in charge?

10:59.307 --> 11:01.662
- Yeah.
- Okay. You got much experience?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.731
Sure. Yeah. I'm good at serving drinks.

11:03.831 --> 11:08.554
I'm good at consuming alcohol
so really I'm over-qualified for the job.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.224
Yeah, well... that's my personal stash.

11:16.324 --> 11:19.647
So... if you can just
keep them cold in a...

11:19.747 --> 11:21.749
You know, don't give them out.

11:21.849 --> 11:26.417
You put open bar on these flyers and people
come running down from the hills.

11:26.517 --> 11:30.272
These... these cocksuckers are expensive.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.828
Yeah, I'll keep them safe for you, sir.

11:33.928 --> 11:36.597
You don't have to call me "sir."
I'm... I'm Sydney Perch.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.266
- Paul.
- Yeah. Nice, Paul.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.304
You wanna have a beer with me?

11:43.404 --> 11:46.574
That's totally cool, just don't...
you know, tell my mom.

11:46.674 --> 11:50.362
I really should wait
till I'm off the clock.

11:51.813 --> 11:54.133
I'm gonna get you started.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.773
There you go.

12:01.923 --> 12:05.026
Sydney? Is little Percy down there?

12:05.426 --> 12:07.679
He's run off again!

12:14.434 --> 12:17.757
I'd better go get him.
Put that on ice, okay.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.031
Weird.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.316
Fuck.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.219
Goddammit!

12:47.001 --> 12:48.760
Jesus.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.259
You see, you see that?
They're like this... There fucking huge.

13:12.359 --> 13:16.181
- Avoid everything here. It's bad.
- Oh, poor baby.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.320
I brought this for you.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.839
I thought you might forget that.

13:24.939 --> 13:28.961
- Don't put it through your hand.
- I'm not gonna put it through my hand.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.930
Kidding.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.288
Can you do me a favor? Can you just
warn that guy about the wasps?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.571
They're just... I don't know.
They're really making me nervous.

13:43.671 --> 13:45.632
- 'Cause if he's... if he's allergic...
- Sydney?

13:45.732 --> 13:49.695
- Yeah. The guy with the Quasimodo.
- Was he drunk?

13:51.645 --> 13:53.881
I mean, I gave him a beer.

13:53.981 --> 13:57.518
So it depends what his tolerance is.
I mean, he did suck it down pretty good.

13:57.618 --> 14:01.189
- Just remember these are our clients.
- Yeah. Aye, aye captain.

14:01.889 --> 14:04.345
Why do I... It's not the fucking
White House, okay?

14:04.445 --> 14:07.128
I mean, her husband was
in the pharmaceutical business.

14:07.228 --> 14:12.127
Some corporate drug dealer. They medicate
the American population into fucking zombies.

14:12.227 --> 14:15.538
- I don't need to respect that.
- You should respect that we're doing a job.

14:16.703 --> 14:19.227
Yes, you're right. Fuck.

14:19.627 --> 14:21.899
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah, it is terrible.

14:21.999 --> 14:24.028
Do you wanna kiss it and make it better?

14:24.178 --> 14:27.715
First aid's in the glove compartment. Okay.
Next to that is a spare pair of pants.

14:27.815 --> 14:30.380
You should put them on,
one leg at a time. Alright?

14:30.480 --> 14:33.287
And while you're at it...
move the van to the back of the house.

14:33.687 --> 14:36.942
Guests arrive in 25 minutes so, chop-chop!

14:40.259 --> 14:43.297
Hey, Paul, I noticed that you
put up all these lights.

14:43.397 --> 14:46.767
Climbed that tree? 'Cause I know
that I didn't get you a ladder.

14:46.867 --> 14:50.623
Looks really nice. I'm really happy
that you're here and you're helping me.

15:06.052 --> 15:07.640
Look good.

15:11.858 --> 15:13.713
Jesus...

16:34.174 --> 16:37.678
Oh, my God. Little guy,
you scared the shit out of me.

16:37.778 --> 16:39.564
Percy.

16:43.949 --> 16:46.174
Excuse me... Hi. Ms. Perch?

16:46.554 --> 16:49.990
I'm sorry, I just, I couldn't help
but admire your garden. It's beautiful.

16:50.090 --> 16:53.027
You're the boy they've sent to tend bar.

16:53.127 --> 16:54.762
It's Paul.

16:54.862 --> 16:57.948
You remind me a bit of my late husband.

16:58.098 --> 17:01.481
He was very fetching.

17:03.013 --> 17:06.607
Why, I do believe I hear
some guests arriving.

17:06.707 --> 17:08.856
Well, I better get back to them.

17:11.176 --> 17:13.714
Come along, Percy. Come along.

17:13.814 --> 17:16.583
Yes, little boy. Come on.

17:16.683 --> 17:18.770
Here we go.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.434
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

17:34.634 --> 17:36.884
- Hi. What can I get you?
- We'll have two reds.

17:36.984 --> 17:39.306
Alright, coming right up.
You two newlyweds?

17:40.006 --> 17:41.894
Thank you.

17:48.481 --> 17:51.603
- Would you like some?
- No. Thank you.

17:59.926 --> 18:01.562
Hello.

18:01.662 --> 18:03.315
Enjoy.

18:04.697 --> 18:07.180
It'll ruin my scotch.

18:09.802 --> 18:11.423
Hello.

18:12.038 --> 18:13.807
Hi. How are you? What can I get you?

18:13.907 --> 18:16.510
Gin, with a splash of flat water, please.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.797
That's a first for the night.

18:21.781 --> 18:24.584
You enjoying the party so far?

18:24.684 --> 18:26.772
I am. I am.

18:29.555 --> 18:31.192
So, how do you know the family?

18:31.292 --> 18:34.228
Oh, we are friends of them,
my husband and I.

18:34.328 --> 18:38.050
- Oh, your husband?
- Almost divorced.

18:38.531 --> 18:41.175
That's... that's sad.

18:41.717 --> 18:43.420
You know.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.807
Yeah.

19:01.088 --> 19:02.756
Reminds me of a joke...

19:02.856 --> 19:06.144
Let's save the punch line for later. Okay?

19:06.626 --> 19:08.247
Okay.

19:10.798 --> 19:12.684
Alright.

19:13.966 --> 19:15.487
Anyway...

19:17.237 --> 19:19.907
Having all the fun here in cougar town?

19:20.007 --> 19:21.642
No, but seriously, do you need anything?

19:21.742 --> 19:25.197
No, it's fine. I'm fine.
Everything's good, actually.

19:26.246 --> 19:28.849
Hey, Mr. Mayor. Everything, okay?

19:28.949 --> 19:32.704
Yes. And this party needs an autopsy.

19:34.655 --> 19:36.590
Oh, yeah, give me a double. No ice.

19:36.690 --> 19:39.493
Who's responsible
for these little piggy thingies?

19:39.593 --> 19:41.428
This young lady right...
What did I tell you?

19:41.528 --> 19:45.099
It's... excuse my language the best fucking
piggy thingies I've ever had in my life.

19:45.199 --> 19:48.189
- Does everything taste okay?
- Oh, they're delicious. Yeah.

19:48.289 --> 19:50.637
- Do you have a card?
- Yeah.

19:50.737 --> 19:54.641
'Cause I'm gonna need someone for my...
re-election party next month.

19:54.741 --> 19:59.097
- Thank you. I'll call you.
- We're keeping our fingers crossed.

19:59.478 --> 20:01.576
For you.

20:01.981 --> 20:06.093
- You two make a good pair.
- Thank you. Thank you.

20:10.723 --> 20:12.422
Hi, Ladies.

20:12.522 --> 20:16.948
Have you tasted this?
They have a whole tray of them up there.

20:45.424 --> 20:47.794
Oh, my God.

20:48.724 --> 20:50.982
This is disgusting.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.528
You should really watch out.
These fucking things are everywhere.

20:57.628 --> 21:00.107
They're really fucking nasty.
Just in case you're allergic or whatever.

21:00.207 --> 21:02.508
You know what I'm allergic to?

21:02.608 --> 21:04.661
- What?
- You bumming me out.

21:04.761 --> 21:09.251
Care for a little relief? I have
a prescription from Dr. Greenthumb.

21:12.985 --> 21:16.757
- Sweet party, dude.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's not bad.

21:17.457 --> 21:20.341
They're super rich, these people.
So if you just keep your head down,

21:20.441 --> 21:23.063
you know, they... I guess they tip well.
That's what Julia says.

21:23.163 --> 21:26.795
Julie, Julie. She's a hottie with a body?

21:27.367 --> 21:31.189
She's not... she doesn't happen
to be available, does she?

21:33.255 --> 21:37.367
- I don't... I haven't asked her.
- I totally get it, man!

21:42.882 --> 21:44.718
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:44.818 --> 21:47.472
I'll have whatever you're making.

21:49.989 --> 21:52.539
I like the way you hold that bottle.

21:59.999 --> 22:02.569
Thank you. That guy was really creepy.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.657
He looks like Ulysses S. Grant.

22:09.508 --> 22:11.629
Thanks for the invite.

22:12.345 --> 22:14.132
What?

22:24.791 --> 22:28.028
Well, mother and I are certainly
delighted you could...

22:28.128 --> 22:31.231
all be here this evening to remember Dad.

22:31.331 --> 22:36.036
These gatherings have... certainly
become a tradition throughout the years.

22:36.136 --> 22:39.206
Sorry, I didn't think
you'd be so cool about it.

22:39.606 --> 22:43.561
Yeah, well, you mean,
everyone can smell it on you, so...

22:43.977 --> 22:44.945
Sorry.

22:45.045 --> 22:49.149
And so... everybody enjoy themselves
and have a great time.

22:49.249 --> 22:53.074
And stay as long as you'd like. And...

22:56.222 --> 22:59.760
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you all for coming.

22:59.860 --> 23:03.815
And for leaving the kids at home.

23:06.233 --> 23:08.020
- Really.
- It was funny.

23:10.603 --> 23:11.734
Fucking shit...

23:14.974 --> 23:16.828
You see that?

23:17.778 --> 23:20.900
Help! Oh, God, help him!

23:29.371 --> 23:31.321
I think something bit him!

23:31.421 --> 23:35.128
- No, no. I couldn't possibly...
- You're a doctor! Help him!

23:35.228 --> 23:38.632
- I'm a gynecologist for Christ's sake!
- What the hell is happening?

23:38.732 --> 23:41.468
Oh, God, get away from him!

23:41.568 --> 23:43.621
I got a cold compress!

23:45.771 --> 23:48.193
Oh, my God! Alright, alright. Watch out!

23:49.775 --> 23:52.446
Somebody call 911! For fuck's sake!
Can you help me with this, sir?

23:52.546 --> 23:55.215
- Yeah, I'll do the best I can.
- Roll him onto the cloth.

23:55.315 --> 23:57.569
One, two, tree.

24:22.108 --> 24:25.110
Everybody get inside right now!

25:07.853 --> 25:12.092
Get off. Get off me! Leave me!
Leave me! Leave me alone!

25:12.192 --> 25:15.013
Don't. Don't. No...

25:37.133 --> 25:38.953
Jesus.

25:50.596 --> 25:52.366
We're taking the party inside, mother.

25:52.466 --> 25:55.087
- Come on home.
- Oh, my God! What's happening?

26:04.644 --> 26:06.565
Shit! Come on, come on.

26:14.386 --> 26:16.441
Goddamn it!

26:30.637 --> 26:32.223
Oh, my God.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.439
What the f...

26:43.359 --> 26:45.246
Oh, God.

26:52.335 --> 26:55.489
Julia... Julia! Julia!

26:57.039 --> 26:58.641
Oh, fuck.

26:58.741 --> 27:00.528
Oh, my...

27:11.287 --> 27:13.723
- Oh, my God.
- Hey!

27:14.823 --> 27:17.209
Get the fuck off him!

27:20.196 --> 27:23.251
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yeah! No, no, no...

27:23.599 --> 27:25.902
- Are you okay?
- I'm going to find...

27:26.002 --> 27:30.579
You two! Julia! Come on! Get in here!

27:30.993 --> 27:32.770
Come on!

27:50.102 --> 27:51.790
Let's go.

28:00.012 --> 28:04.670
Guys, everyone is in the kitchen.
Let's go! Come on!

28:10.657 --> 28:13.558
What the hell just happened?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.786
You made it.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.705
I feel sick, Flora.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.975
No, Mrs. Perch, you're okay.
Everything's okay.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.977
What are we gonna do now?
What the hell just happened?

28:31.077 --> 28:33.680
We just heard screams,
and all the people were just...

28:33.780 --> 28:36.917
- Those... those're bees.
- They're not bees. Those are wasps.

28:37.017 --> 28:39.286
Who gives a shit? Bees, wasps.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.722
We spray for wasps, don't we, Sydney?

28:41.822 --> 28:45.122
It was mania. It was hysteria.
That's what it was.

28:45.222 --> 28:49.514
- My puppy's out there.
- Fuck the pooch, ma.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.433
Who called 911?

28:53.533 --> 28:55.936
Cell service is virtually
non-existent out here.

28:56.036 --> 28:58.438
But there's... there's a phone
in the office.

28:58.538 --> 29:00.925
What did they say when you called?

29:02.675 --> 29:05.312
- You didn't call?
- Are you all insane?

29:05.412 --> 29:08.118
- Nobody called 911?
- What am I supposed to say?

29:08.218 --> 29:11.651
You say the mayor has been down.
And that he can't retreat.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.321
- Alright, listen, listen... Listen!
- Then you see what happens.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.289
We need to find out. Is anyone stung?

29:17.389 --> 29:19.726
I got him before he got me.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.361
Oh, God.

29:21.461 --> 29:24.038
- Well, that's good. That's very good.
- Just hurry.

29:24.138 --> 29:26.533
- No, Mrs. Perch. It's okay.
- Flora, it's not okay.

29:26.633 --> 29:29.169
It's not... You people don't seem...

29:29.269 --> 29:33.340
You don't seem to see how severe this is.
You need medical attention, Mrs. Perch.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.809
Everybody at your garden party
needs medical attention.

29:35.909 --> 29:38.547
We need to move from the kitchen to the front
of the house so when the EMTs arrive

29:38.647 --> 29:40.645
you can easily get into the ambulance.
So why don't we do that?

29:40.745 --> 29:44.884
I'd rather just stay here.
But you will show them where we are.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.420
- Okay. Can you please keep an eye on her?
- Yeah, I will.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.089
Sydney, can you help me
find the fucking phone?

29:49.189 --> 29:50.790
My heart is racing.

29:52.554 --> 29:56.796
Sydney! You're just going to leave me?

29:56.896 --> 29:59.518
Flora will take care of you, ma.
She's at least good at that.

30:04.604 --> 30:07.025
Hey, hey. I'm here.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.368
You're fuckin' kid... What year is this?

30:26.593 --> 30:29.214
- What?
- What? What the fuck? Just...

30:37.569 --> 30:38.778
Oh, my God!

30:45.177 --> 30:47.147
Oh, fuck!

30:47.247 --> 30:49.883
- Okay, the phone's not gonna work.
- Oh, that's great.

30:49.983 --> 30:53.371
That's fuckin'... Whoop-dee-doo!

30:55.521 --> 30:58.106
Help me! Paul!

30:59.626 --> 31:01.394
- How do I open the fuckin' window?
- Need to open the door.

31:01.494 --> 31:04.064
- How do we know that he hasn't been...
- He's fine. He's right here. He's fine!

31:04.164 --> 31:07.400
- We have to let him in!
- Have you been stung?

31:07.500 --> 31:10.337
No. No. I tried to help them.
This is not my blood.

31:10.437 --> 31:11.978
- Prove it!
- Prove it? He's fucking...

31:12.078 --> 31:14.725
Listen, go around back
and I'll let you in.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.194
Save me.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.215
Fuck!

31:22.445 --> 31:24.968
Oh, fuck. Oh, my...

31:32.858 --> 31:34.479
Fuck!

31:35.944 --> 31:37.826
Look out behind you.

31:38.698 --> 31:40.518
Oh, my God!

31:41.800 --> 31:45.189
- What are we gonna fucking do?
- Get away... fuckin'!

31:48.741 --> 31:50.828
Well...

31:50.928 --> 31:51.869
that's that.

31:51.969 --> 31:54.180
- That's that?
- We could have saved him.

31:54.280 --> 31:58.017
Want to let them suckers in here too?
No thank you.

31:58.117 --> 32:01.721
Can't we just go around back and go
through the field and then just keep going?

32:01.821 --> 32:04.957
That's the dumbest thing I've heard. Didn't
you just see what happened to that guy?

32:05.057 --> 32:07.493
- Do you have any better ideas?
- Both of you guys, shut the fuck up!

32:07.593 --> 32:10.830
Okay, little wasps follow us
for fucking miles if they're pissed off.

32:10.930 --> 32:15.835
Sydney, we need... we need a small area
that we can barricade. Is there a cellar?

32:15.935 --> 32:17.958
- A basement. What about the basement?
- Basement?

32:18.058 --> 32:20.009
- It's like a fortress, right?
- You guys wanna hide?

32:20.109 --> 32:21.558
- Yes!
- Let's hide.

32:21.658 --> 32:23.843
Yes. Wait, wait, wait! Sydney, wait!

32:23.943 --> 32:28.032
We need to get everybody from the kitchen,
together we need to travel...

32:37.342 --> 32:40.750
Stop! Get away from her!
We gotta get her out of here!

32:40.850 --> 32:42.362
Help me grab her arm.

32:51.537 --> 32:52.873
Mom!

32:53.573 --> 32:56.207
What? You wanna kill me too now?

33:05.819 --> 33:07.301
- Holy...
- Mother...

33:07.401 --> 33:09.055
Fucker!

33:10.322 --> 33:12.783
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

33:16.119 --> 33:18.015
Let's go.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.833
Please. Help me.

33:19.933 --> 33:22.936
Oh, great! What we gotta drag
the Mexican around?

33:23.036 --> 33:25.690
I'm from fucking Argentina, <i>hijo de pu...</i>

33:26.338 --> 33:28.092
Fuck!

33:30.742 --> 33:33.131
Flora. Flora. Flora.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.042
Come on, let's go. Come on.

33:55.135 --> 33:57.688
- Sydney, wait! Wait for us!
- Come on. Come on.

34:24.096 --> 34:27.952
- Come on.
- They're inside. They're inside.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.556
Open the door. Open the door.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.743
Sydney, you gotta open the door!

34:36.842 --> 34:39.279
- Right now! You must open the door!
- Go! Go! Go!

34:39.379 --> 34:42.215
You have to open the fucking door
right now! Right now!

34:42.315 --> 34:45.601
Go, go, go! Get inside! Get inside!

34:47.719 --> 34:52.358
- Okay. They're gonna break through.
- No, the door's to fire code standards.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.960
Plus Mom hates it down here.
She never comes to the basement.

34:55.061 --> 34:59.483
- She's not a she anymore, Sydney.
- Oh, I found it!

35:08.239 --> 35:09.894
Fuck!

35:12.377 --> 35:14.080
Oh, f...

35:14.180 --> 35:18.751
Forgive my ever-loving mouth but what
the fuck are we supposed to do now?

35:18.851 --> 35:20.638
Anybody?

35:37.936 --> 35:40.748
What a wonderful selection.

35:41.452 --> 35:43.761
Those are vintage.

35:44.175 --> 35:49.200
Really? I see that. It's a 1943 Bordeaux.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.303
Excuse me. Hey.

35:55.754 --> 35:59.180
I forgot my bottle opener upstairs.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.713
Can you help me open this? Young man.

36:04.529 --> 36:06.986
Yeah, actually. I have a trick.

36:07.086 --> 36:10.988
You put the base in your shoe
so the glass doesn't break.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.140
What?

36:13.605 --> 36:15.859
You've blood on your face.

36:28.921 --> 36:30.808
It worked.

36:32.157 --> 36:35.816
I could have saved my last marriage
if I had a trick like that.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.499
The dames must be dancing all over you.

36:39.599 --> 36:41.801
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:41.901 --> 36:45.471
I'm swimming in poontang
as my friends like to call it.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.591
Oh, God.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.294
They're not dames anymore.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.245
Thanks.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.814
What?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.103
I don't know. I think, you know...

37:17.203 --> 37:21.874
You'd think she'd be grateful
that I'm here. That I'm helping out.

37:21.974 --> 37:25.262
I know she still treats me
like an employee, even now.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.531
You know...

37:28.713 --> 37:31.536
She's holding up. She's just afraid.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.473
- I am, too.
- Yeah.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.909
I shot myself.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.824
No, I mean it. I shot myself.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.216
Sorry.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.758
Work of art right there.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.294
It's not bad.

37:57.876 --> 38:01.147
You're kidding, right? It looks like...

38:01.247 --> 38:03.967
we're all taking a shit or something.

38:10.322 --> 38:13.960
When my... when my pops died...

38:14.060 --> 38:17.047
my ma could barely
even look at that thing.

38:18.496 --> 38:21.557
You said there were
good times in your toast.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.088
Good times...

38:24.602 --> 38:26.805
They both hated me.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.695
To Mom I was just a problem and...

38:29.795 --> 38:32.478
to Dad I was just some freak
he couldn't care.

38:32.578 --> 38:36.333
And if there were good times,
I... I wasn't invited.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.323
You don't look so hot.

38:44.423 --> 38:47.493
You know, all those people up there and...

38:47.593 --> 38:50.581
- Just all of the...
- I'm sorry...

38:50.795 --> 38:54.318
about everything.

39:05.677 --> 39:09.199
You know, I just realized
if we all make it out of here alive...

39:09.981 --> 39:11.784
there's a great chance
I'm gonna get reelected

39:11.884 --> 39:14.589
'cause I have a hell of a lot to say.

39:17.222 --> 39:19.009
Yeah.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.913
With all that going on out there...

39:23.261 --> 39:25.630
How did you know what to do?

39:25.730 --> 39:28.986
Oh, I don't know. I just...

39:29.100 --> 39:33.106
I just did. I was a lifeguard for a couple
summers. So, I guess it wore off.

39:33.406 --> 39:35.759
That must have been a great gig.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.746
Last week I was there, a little kid
fell in the pool and I just...

39:40.846 --> 39:44.368
Instinct jump in. Saved him.
Got the water out of his lungs.

39:44.849 --> 39:49.206
He was alive. He said thank you to me.
You know, I put him in the ambulance.

39:49.622 --> 39:51.743
And a week later, he died of pneumonia.

39:54.360 --> 39:58.331
You know... saving people for what?
My instinct for what?

39:58.431 --> 40:01.167
I never expected that shrimp cocktails
would sprout wings

40:01.267 --> 40:03.736
and fucking eat people, it's just...
God, I don't know.

40:03.836 --> 40:06.461
I've seen atrocities. I was...

40:06.905 --> 40:09.475
dug in with the ninth infantry.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.343
Korea.

40:11.443 --> 40:15.247
Saw thousands of bodies.
Hundreds of thousands of bodies.

40:15.347 --> 40:17.733
As far as the eye could see.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.888
I thought I'd take
those images to my grave.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.941
Before I die.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.479
You know what?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.996
You really stood up.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.550
Good work.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.313
Expensive.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.516
I know drinking on the job is a big no-no.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.651
But when people start losing their limbs

40:52.751 --> 40:57.368
and their eyeballs pop out of their face.
I just, I find it... needed.

40:57.468 --> 41:00.459
Well, I'd say we're off the clock.

41:01.393 --> 41:03.596
Could you imagine the overtime?

41:03.696 --> 41:06.982
I'm this close to a new oven
in the kitchen.

41:07.082 --> 41:09.368
I'd get an old VW bug.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.971
Not to be ironic, but just to be cool.

41:12.071 --> 41:15.092
And I would just drive...

41:15.907 --> 41:18.544
the whole country, all fifty states.

41:18.644 --> 41:23.616
- All fifty states? Even Hawaii?
- Oh, God. Hawaii? First.

41:23.716 --> 41:25.738
I mean, how're you gonna get there?

41:25.838 --> 41:29.421
I... I would... air lift it, probably.

41:29.521 --> 41:34.313
- It's gonna be a lot of money.
- Well, that's why I need the overtime.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.181
I know a joke.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.893
Good for you. Just one?

41:58.993 --> 42:00.285
Do you wanna hear it?

42:00.385 --> 42:02.021
- Not really.
- I'm gonna tell you.

42:02.121 --> 42:03.722
Okay.

42:03.822 --> 42:06.743
What is a bee's favorite movie?

42:08.277 --> 42:10.512
That's a tough one.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.588
No idea.

42:20.255 --> 42:22.510
How the hell can all of this be happening?

42:26.444 --> 42:28.665
Mutations.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.750
What?

42:31.850 --> 42:35.220
Mutations, the fertilizer
for the garden...

42:35.320 --> 42:37.039
came from God only knows where.
But my mom...

42:37.139 --> 42:38.725
You're kidding.
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:38.825 --> 42:40.826
My mom didn't like the stuff
from the Garden Depot.

42:40.926 --> 42:46.232
So I took my dad's leftover growth
hormones and I mixed it with the fertilizer.

42:46.332 --> 42:49.702
I'm sorry, you're saying that you...
You spiced up some fertilizer?

42:49.802 --> 42:52.805
And now we're sitting
in a giant ball of wasp shit.

42:52.905 --> 42:56.195
You're saying you knew? Those people
are fucking dead because of you.

42:56.295 --> 42:59.812
- I didn't know about the bugs.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

42:59.912 --> 43:02.314
They knocked the lights out.
How do they know how to do that?

43:02.414 --> 43:06.994
- What are they, electricians now?
- There's a back-up generator.

43:07.352 --> 43:10.556
We'll wait till the sun comes up. And then
we'll make a run for it in the morning.

43:10.656 --> 43:14.393
- We have to drive the hell out of here.
- Where are the keys?

43:14.493 --> 43:18.415
Keys, keys.
God, I lost the fucking van keys.

43:20.031 --> 43:22.368
Alright, I'm gonna retrace my steps.

43:22.468 --> 43:25.271
I'm gonna find the keys to the van
and we're gonna drive 'til we run out of gas.

43:25.371 --> 43:26.906
No! I won't let you go alone.

43:27.006 --> 43:30.260
Will you just shut the fuck up
and trust me, please?

43:30.808 --> 43:32.244
I'm the only one who goes.

43:32.344 --> 43:36.433
Don't go out there. 'Cause the wasps
will come in here and lay eggs in me.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.448
How do I know when you'll be back?

43:45.123 --> 43:47.177
You don't.

43:50.829 --> 43:52.765
"Singing in the Rain."

43:52.865 --> 43:56.969
The bee's favorite movie.
I mean, I know it's a dead joke, but...

43:57.069 --> 43:59.223
I like it, I don't know.

44:01.473 --> 44:03.760
Close the windows behind me.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.546
Oh, Jesus. Fuck me!

45:24.022 --> 45:28.300
What the fuck am I doing? Okay, okay.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.428
That young man has balls of steel.

45:47.528 --> 45:50.233
To be a man you have to be a man.

45:51.282 --> 45:52.903
Yeah.

45:54.218 --> 45:58.375
If you don't mind, I'm gonna try
that shoe trick again.

47:06.724 --> 47:08.745
You alright?

47:33.551 --> 47:35.238
Percy.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.607
Percy.

47:37.955 --> 47:41.081
God damn it. Percy...

47:41.426 --> 47:43.280
What's the matter with you?

47:51.436 --> 47:53.323
Get away!

47:55.541 --> 47:58.476
The weenie. He got bit and didn't tell us.

48:06.784 --> 48:08.438
Percy.

48:52.530 --> 48:54.432
Oh, Jesus!

48:54.532 --> 48:56.386
Oh, my God!

49:08.789 --> 49:12.025
Oh, God. Oh... Oh, God!
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

49:44.049 --> 49:45.869
Help us.

50:02.633 --> 50:05.022
What is going on?

50:28.192 --> 50:29.880
Alright.

50:39.053 --> 50:40.841
Are you okay?

50:42.073 --> 50:44.427
Did you find the keys?

50:45.242 --> 50:47.530
Yes. Yes, I did.

50:48.479 --> 50:50.400
- Is it still safe?
- No, it's not.

50:54.386 --> 50:57.440
We have to go through the house.
Come on. Let's go.

52:05.890 --> 52:07.844
Okay.

52:20.504 --> 52:22.525
Oh, my God.

52:38.923 --> 52:41.494
Okay, come on.

54:04.141 --> 54:07.354
Alright. Just gotta go.

54:35.773 --> 54:37.527
No.

55:30.394 --> 55:32.115
Okay.

56:13.721 --> 56:15.764
I got this.

56:26.750 --> 56:28.253
Damn it!

56:28.353 --> 56:31.193
This stuff's harder than granite.

56:34.491 --> 56:36.293
Shit.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.247
Fuck!

57:02.820 --> 57:04.374
I'll go.

57:12.713 --> 57:14.267
Come on! Quick!

57:22.857 --> 57:25.311
- Hold on!
- Get out of here!

57:26.011 --> 57:27.615
Goddamn it!

57:55.739 --> 57:57.460
Kiss my ass!

58:00.511 --> 58:02.465
Come on.

58:03.881 --> 58:05.601
Fuck!

58:11.088 --> 58:12.742
Fuck!

58:42.820 --> 58:46.042
- They're nailed shut.
- It's like fucking Fort Knox in here.

59:04.374 --> 59:08.279
I don't wanna be here anymore.
I wanna be at home.

59:08.379 --> 59:11.316
I gotta feed my dia...
my diabetic dog Ace.

59:11.416 --> 59:15.304
Then I'm gonna take a bath,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

59:18.055 --> 59:20.309
That's what I need to do.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.231
I need to sell my business.

59:26.331 --> 59:29.917
I mean, nobody's gonna hire me
after this. Are you kidding me?

59:30.017 --> 59:32.514
I might need to get a new job.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.891
As do I.

59:36.540 --> 59:38.842
- You could be a good teacher.
- Yeah?

59:38.942 --> 59:43.823
Yeah. You'd have little boys
giving you apples and flirting with you.

59:44.414 --> 59:47.385
Oh, come on.
I think you'd be a good janitor.

59:47.485 --> 59:50.755
I would be a good janitor.
I'm really good at cleaning.

59:50.855 --> 59:52.842
Not really.

59:57.928 --> 01:00:01.521
- Are we gonna work at the same school?
- If it's in Hawaii.

01:00:01.621 --> 01:00:05.612
- I'm down with that. I need to be warm.
- I love being warm.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:08.524
I like cuddling.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.744
You know, you're a man.
You're not supposed to admit that, right?

01:00:12.844 --> 01:00:16.881
It's sexual. There's touching involved.
Spooning. It's fu... What? Fuck you.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:18.901
You wish.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.905
- Do you like making out?
- The...

01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:53.803
God dammit!

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.706
Come on. Help me, help me.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.756
Help me flip this.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.516
Stop.

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:28.840
Stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.575
It's dead! It's dead!
It's dead. Are you okay?

01:01:32.824 --> 01:01:35.645
Look at me. Are you okay?

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:49.325
Come on.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:20.282
We need to go.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.128
Go, go, go, go.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.932
No!

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.697
No.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:15.733
No! No!

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.929
No!

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:25.294
You got a little something there? Wake up.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:33.235
There you go.

01:07:52.595 --> 01:07:54.307
How you doing?

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:18.212
Somebody's got an ouchie.

01:08:19.063 --> 01:08:22.555
- No!
- Got to have you strong and healthy.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.390
I wanna get that out.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.675
Ouchie.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.443
Mother's been waiting for you.

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:29.140
We've all been waiting for you.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:39.720
Look at her. Look at her.

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:14.709
She wants you. She picked you.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.166
Sydney, fucking...

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.153
You're gonna be my new daddy.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.124
Sydney, fucking stop it!

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:29.764
Please, please stop it.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:33.598
Stop and think for yourself, man.
She's fucking using you.

01:10:33.998 --> 01:10:37.234
I know you can fucking hear me.
Just listen, just stop, please.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.906
Seriously, I need your help.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.651
Mother wants you.

01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:55.753
Fuck your mom, Sydney.

01:10:55.853 --> 01:10:59.490
Everything's gonna be alright.
Come on, now.

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:00.943
Come on.

01:11:04.744 --> 01:11:06.632
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:40.582
Back off!

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.329
Come on.

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:03.573
You fuck.

01:12:24.175 --> 01:12:27.831
What you gonna do now, you old bitch?

01:12:28.412 --> 01:12:30.565
What are you gonna do now?

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.318
Come on.

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:58.060
Get up. Come on.

01:13:01.177 --> 01:13:04.048
- Are you okay to drive?
- I think so.

01:13:04.148 --> 01:13:06.735
The whole fucking nest is coming.

01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:09.571
Good.

01:13:09.901 --> 01:13:11.329
Come on!

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:35.362
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.863
- Are you alright?
- Fine.

01:13:59.063 --> 01:14:01.890
- What?
- I'm okay!

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.728
Holy fucking shit!

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:17.476
That's one way to do it.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.434
- Get out of the car.
- No.

01:15:28.534 --> 01:15:31.913
- Get out of the fucking car!
- Fuck you!

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.496
Alright. Here we go!

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.357
Alright.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.268
Julia, are you okay?

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.504
Julia?

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.141
Julia?

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.827
Julia!

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:03.498
Fuck!

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:39.934
Julia!

01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:42.837
Julia, wake up.

01:18:43.002 --> 01:18:44.856
Wake up.

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.343
Wake up.

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:52.362
Wake up! Wake up!

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:55.298
We fucking made it out!
You're not gonna die! Wake up!

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:58.235
Wake up! Wake up!

01:18:58.335 --> 01:19:00.188
Wake up.

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:18.039
Are you okay?

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:22.128
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

01:19:22.228 --> 01:19:24.252
Scared the shit out of me.

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:54.977
<i>Looks like we got a possible 10...</i>

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.648
Please, sir, we are gonna get a...

01:21:29.368 --> 01:21:31.848
Hey! What do you make of this?
