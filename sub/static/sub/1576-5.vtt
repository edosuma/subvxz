00:01.868 --> 00:03.268
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:03.270 --> 00:04.470
Thanks for coming in, guys.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.405
It's always
a pleasure seeing you.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.173
I mean, she's so pretty.
You're so pretty.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.410
You know anyone
we can set her up with?

00:11.412 --> 00:13.545
I appreciate the thought,
but I am perfectly happy

00:13.547 --> 00:15.681
With my... Cats.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.750
Anyway...

00:17.752 --> 00:20.152
How would you guys feel
about adopting an older child?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.488
Wow. Like, how old
are we talking?

00:22.490 --> 00:25.024
Like, I've been taking care
of this one since he was 43.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.125
(laughs)

00:26.127 --> 00:27.926
He's been a
wonderful provider.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.796
And he only spanks me
when I ask him to.

00:30.798 --> 00:34.600
Wow, that is a lot to take in
before 10:00 a.M. On a Monday.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.068
That's what he said.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.603
Okay, please stop.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.738
That's what he said.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.674
Oh! The reason I bring it up
is because there is

00:42.676 --> 00:44.510
A six-year-old boy
who's been bouncing around

00:44.512 --> 00:45.944
The foster system for a while,

00:45.946 --> 00:48.447
And I think he'd be
a great match for you guys.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.648
Wow, really?

00:49.650 --> 00:52.017
Uh, well, six
is a great age.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.453
Potty-trained
but not ashamed of you yet.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.788
Walden:
Well...

00:55.790 --> 00:58.123
Well, uh, can we adopt him
right away?

00:58.125 --> 00:59.691
Well, we'd start
with a weekend visit.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.127
See if it's a good fit,
then, assuming it is,

01:02.129 --> 01:04.029
You guys would become
his foster parents.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.998
After six months,
if everyone agrees,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.833
You can officially adopt him.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.902
Oh, and-and-and
if we don't agree,

01:09.904 --> 01:12.704
Can we credit those six months
to a kid that we do like?

01:12.706 --> 01:15.207
(all laugh)

01:15.209 --> 01:17.776
Wow, I-I always thought
we were gonna get a baby,

01:17.778 --> 01:21.380
But I kind of like the idea
of giving an older kid a shot.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.749
Well, louis certainly
deserves a shot.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.050
Louis?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.819
Louie?

01:26.821 --> 01:28.053
Aw, sweet lou.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.755
(bellows):
Lou!

01:29.757 --> 01:32.124
Uh, is he married to that name
or can we change it?

01:32.126 --> 01:33.792
Alan.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.260
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.063
I just, you know,
I had my heart set on beckett.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.333
Look, I'm gonna be
honest with you guys.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.035
Louis has had a rough time.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.903
He's been in foster homes,
group homes.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.472
He's moved around a lot.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.806
We thought we had him
placed for adoption

01:47.808 --> 01:49.208
A few months ago,
but it fell through.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.143
So he's gonna be
a little gun-shy.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.444
Well, don't worry about that.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.079
I mean, I'm sure we'll have
a great time together.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.380
Just don't expect a lot.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.683
Same thing I told this one
on our wedding night.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.122
Wow, I really like this idea.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.857
I mean, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have a son.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.458
How cool is that gonna be?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.960
I mean, and-and
you get to relive

02:07.962 --> 02:10.329
All those great
father-son moments.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.733
â™ª by the time
you hear the siren â™ª

02:14.735 --> 02:17.169
â™ª it's already too late

02:17.171 --> 02:20.472
â™ª one goes to the morgue
and the other to jail â™ª

02:20.474 --> 02:22.040
â™ª one gets wasted
and the other's a waste... â™ª

02:22.042 --> 02:22.908
(vomiting)

02:22.910 --> 02:24.676
Good thinking.
Aah!

02:25.345 --> 02:27.112
(farts)

02:30.884 --> 02:32.217
Dad?
Yeah, buddy?

02:32.219 --> 02:35.521
Bite me.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.756
(farting)

02:37.758 --> 02:41.326
(fart echoing)

02:41.328 --> 02:43.228
Yeah, all those

02:43.230 --> 02:46.265
Great father-son moments.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.767
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

02:48.769 --> 02:51.970
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.508
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

02:58.344 --> 02:59.811
What the hell?

02:59.813 --> 03:01.680
Walden?
Walden: Up here!

03:01.682 --> 03:04.116
Check it out!
Isn't this awesome?

03:04.118 --> 03:06.151
They have one just like it
at the google headquarters!

03:06.153 --> 03:08.053
Oh, you know what you get
when you google

03:08.055 --> 03:09.721
"greatest dad in the world"?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.959
This guy!

03:13.961 --> 03:15.694
(laughs)

03:15.696 --> 03:17.196
(stammers)
what is going on?

03:17.198 --> 03:18.263
What is all this?

03:18.265 --> 03:20.199
Oh, uh, well,
I went to the toy store

03:20.201 --> 03:21.667
And got a few things for louis.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.102
"a few things"?
Okay, I don't want to be the guy

03:24.104 --> 03:25.971
To point out the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.707
But there's an 800-pound gorilla
in the room.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.642
I just want him to like it here.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.910
Well, so do I.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.879
But if you build disneyland
in your house,

03:33.881 --> 03:36.782
You'll never get the thrill
of taking him to disneyland.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.284
Ah. You're right.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.187
Damn it. I got to cancel
mickey and minnie.

03:42.189 --> 03:42.955
What?

03:42.957 --> 03:44.022
Oh, I was gonna have him

03:44.024 --> 03:45.224
Wake him up in the morning.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.391
(imitating mickey mouse):
Hey, louis.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.559
Ready for breakfast?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.727
We've got orange juice

03:48.729 --> 03:51.029
And waffles shaped just like me!

03:51.031 --> 03:53.765
I think it's great that you're
so excited about being a dad.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.369
And the best part is...
No stretch marks for me.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.005
You know, you're my best friend,

04:00.007 --> 04:02.074
But you're an odd little man.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.477
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:07.213 --> 04:08.480
Oh, hey.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.548
What are you doing up?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.916
I couldn't sleep.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.051
Oh, I get it.
Excited about tomorrow?

04:13.053 --> 04:15.287
More like terrified
about tomorrow.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.823
Why are you getting paper towels

04:17.825 --> 04:20.192
In the middle of the..
Oh, you... Never mind.

04:20.194 --> 04:21.627
I don't want to know.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.130
That's a good call.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.267
You want to talk about it?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.636
There's a kid
showing up here tomorrow.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.105
And he needs a dad,
and I don't know if I can do it.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.240
What? Why not?

04:35.242 --> 04:37.809
Well, I've never had
a successful relationship

04:37.811 --> 04:40.345
With anyone in my life
except for you.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.980
Four years next Thursday.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.982
Yeah, I got your wish list.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.052
They're just ideas.
Make it your own.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.154
Look, the fact that you've
screwed up with women

04:49.156 --> 04:50.589
Doesn't mean you can't
be a great father.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.691
I don't even know
what a good dad looks like.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.226
I mean, I know
what a bad dad looks like.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.728
It's an empty chair
across the table from my mom.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.997
Which later gets filled
by my "uncle kenneth"

04:58.999 --> 05:00.432
Who sold speedboats.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.168
And "uncle rob"
who sold insurance.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.304
Then "uncle stan" who sold pot.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.539
I liked uncle stan.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.641
I get it. I didn't grow up
with a dad, either.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.910
When jake was born,
I was scared out of my mind.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.879
Why were you scared?
You're a great dad.

05:13.881 --> 05:17.182
Okay, I'm gonna
tell you something

05:17.184 --> 05:19.851
That I've, I've never
told anybody before.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.988
When jake was a baby...

05:22.990 --> 05:24.923
I dropped him.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.628
Right smack on his head.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.230
Oh, my god.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.566
Now I feel awful
about all the times I said,

05:34.568 --> 05:38.103
"were you dropped
on your head as a baby?"

05:38.105 --> 05:40.439
My point is
that jake turned out fine.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.908
I mean, sure, he had to repeat
seventh grade math

05:42.910 --> 05:45.510
A couple of times, but he was
born at the right time.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.179
You know? Computers.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.582
Wait, so what you're saying is

05:50.584 --> 05:53.285
Even if I screw up a little,
it's not the end of the world?

05:53.287 --> 05:55.454
The fact that you're worried
about being a good dad

05:55.456 --> 05:57.289
Is what's gonna
make you a great one.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.891
Thanks.
Hmm.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.193
You're a good friend.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.761
All right.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.129
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.231
Good night.
Good night.

06:10.636 --> 06:13.905
Oh, baby jake.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.841
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

06:15.843 --> 06:18.410
It'll be nice having
a kid around here again.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.479
Running up and
down the stairs.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.048
Laughing at all
the silliest things.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.118
And they'll believe almost
anything you tell them.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.419
No kidding.

06:27.421 --> 06:28.587
Jake still thinks
one of the first men

06:28.589 --> 06:29.688
On the moon was
buzz lightyear.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.789
Ha!

06:30.791 --> 06:32.357
(doorbell rings)

06:32.359 --> 06:34.226
I'll get it!

06:34.228 --> 06:37.462
You got to admit that would've
been way cooler with a slide.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.370
Look who's here.
Hi, guys.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.938
This is louis.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.573
Hi, louis!
Sweet lou!

06:48.575 --> 06:51.109
(bellows):
Lou!

06:52.612 --> 06:54.513
We're not booing,
we're lou-ing.

06:54.515 --> 06:58.216
Louis, this is walden and alan.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.284
Hi.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.285
You're gonna be staying

07:00.287 --> 07:01.319
With them for the weekend.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.921
Oh, uh, don't worry, buddy,

07:02.923 --> 07:05.424
I was only supposed
to stay here for a weekend, too.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.826
(singsongy):
12 years later.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.928
Walden:
Oh, and, uh,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.363
This is berta.
Uh, she helps

07:11.365 --> 07:12.664
Take care of us around here.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.499
Look at that face.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.403
Walden, you might have
some competition

07:18.405 --> 07:20.205
For the best looking
man in the house.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.107
You mean so-some
more competition?

07:22.109 --> 07:25.143
Nope.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.345
Do you have any cheez-its?

07:27.347 --> 07:30.615
Uh, well, if we don't,
we could get some.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.784
Okay, I'll stay.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.920
All right, well,
I want you guys

07:34.922 --> 07:36.688
To get to know each other,
so I'm gonna go.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.957
But you have my number
if you need anything.
Oh, uh, wait.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.194
Uh, does-does he come with an
instruction manual or something?

07:42.196 --> 07:45.330
You'll be fine.
Bye, louis.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.731
Uh, okay, uh...

07:46.733 --> 07:48.500
Should we have tipped her?

07:48.502 --> 07:49.668
You're asking me?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.870
I don't even tip the pizza guy.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.371
I don't like pizza.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.906
I like cheez-its.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.142
Oh, well, you know,
when you think about it,

07:57.144 --> 08:00.345
A pizza is just
a really big cheez-it

08:00.347 --> 08:02.614
With sauce.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.818
We're gonna get
cheez-its, right?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.253
Berta?

08:08.255 --> 08:09.454
I'm on it.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.857
I'll be back as
soon as I can.

08:11.859 --> 08:12.991
And, louis?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.226
That's the first time I ever

08:14.228 --> 08:16.228
Said that and meant it.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.763
Hey, louis?
Welcome to our house.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.500
Do you want to come on in?

08:21.502 --> 08:22.934
Oh, my god. Look at him.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.302
He's adorable.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.771
Alan:
I know, I know.
He's like one of those tv kids.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.006
Maybe we can put him
in commercials.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.508
We know he likes cheez-its.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.009
Alan, do you really want to be

08:31.011 --> 08:33.278
Making less money
than a six-year-old?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.680
Oh, oh, oh. Oh.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.349
Who is that?

08:37.351 --> 08:38.550
This is timothy.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.618
He's a seal.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.886
Oh! Well, hi, timothy.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.920
I'm walden.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.954
And I'm alan.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.357
Timothy doesn't talk.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.658
Oh, right, yeah.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.360
Because he's a seal.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.096
No, because he's a toy.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.498
Right. He-he's a toy.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.769
(exhales)

08:57.771 --> 09:01.239
Wow. Got a lot
of weekend left.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.943
So, which one of you
is the mommy?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.812
Um...
Um...

09:07.814 --> 09:10.048
Well, that's-that's
a great question.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.416
And one I was hoping
you wouldn't ask

09:11.418 --> 09:12.951
In the first five minutes.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.386
You know, see, in some families,

09:14.388 --> 09:17.188
There's a mommy and a daddy.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.524
But in other families,
like this one,

09:19.526 --> 09:21.359
There's, there's two daddies.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.594
Why?

09:22.596 --> 09:27.165
Wow, that is
another great question.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.634
Um... Alan?

09:29.636 --> 09:31.436
No, no. You're doing great.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.571
Okay.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.472
He's the mommy.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.708
I told you, timothy.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.777
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:42.782 --> 09:44.349
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:44.351 --> 09:47.052
Hey, louis, check it out.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.854
Casa de louis.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.556
Chez louie.

09:51.558 --> 09:54.459
San louis... Obispo.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.663
Basically what I'm saying is
this is your room.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.132
Cool!
You know, I thought we could
decorate it together.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.802
Lucky. He never let me.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.271
Oh, and check this out.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.973
This is your bed.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.975
But if you're thinking about
jumping up and down on it,

10:09.977 --> 10:12.777
You're gonna be
in a lot of trouble...

10:12.779 --> 10:15.680
If you don't!
(laughing)

10:16.849 --> 10:19.284
Uh, we also heard, uh,
that you like to draw.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.653
So check out
this fully stocked art table.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.122
You got, uh, markers,
crayons, paints.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.692
Someone's gonna put
the "arty" back in "party."

10:27.694 --> 10:29.060
(chuckles)

10:29.062 --> 10:31.363
Okay, so, uh, why don't we,
uh, unpack your stuff?

10:31.365 --> 10:33.832
We'll put it in the dresser,
and then we'll go do something.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.967
No, I don't need to unpack.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.302
Oh, okay.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.771
Uh, well, then it's straight
to the good times, huh?

10:39.773 --> 10:42.440
For king louie
the fun-teenth.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.175
(laughs)

10:44.177 --> 10:45.877
I apologize.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.479
Walden:
So, yeah,

10:47.481 --> 10:48.647
What do you want to do?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.181
You know, we could play a game,

10:50.183 --> 10:52.450
We could go to the park,
we could go to the zoo,

10:52.452 --> 10:54.686
We could go to seaworld
or disneyland

10:54.688 --> 10:56.821
Or legoland, or we could
play legos in the house,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.823
Or we could play house,
or we could build a house,

10:58.825 --> 11:00.625
Or we could listen
to house music.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.628
Oontz. Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.
Oontz. Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.264
(alan and walden
imitating house music)

11:06.266 --> 11:07.799
What's up, miami!

11:07.801 --> 11:09.134
Oontz. Oontz.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.837
Or-or we don't have
to do any of that.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.039
We could...

11:14.041 --> 11:16.841
Do something else, like...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.043
Alan?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.878
Uh, uh, we could,
we could go to the beach.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.646
Oh, that's a great idea.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.916
Oh, but where are we
gonna find one of those?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.052
You live on the beach.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.120
Oh! That's right!

11:29.122 --> 11:31.289
It's your backyard.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.158
So, what do you say?
You want to go?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.259
Okay.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.394
We got an okay. Okay.
So let's go.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.163
Let's do this.
To the beach we go.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.765
Oh, hey, uh,
if you need a bathing suit,

11:40.767 --> 11:42.300
It's in the top drawer.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.736
So why don't you change,

11:44.738 --> 11:46.171
And we'll change,
and then we'll go

11:46.173 --> 11:48.173
Have a party on the beach.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.142
Oontz. Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.
Oontz. Oontz. Oontz.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.911
Oontz. Oontz.
Oontz.

11:52.913 --> 11:53.912
Oontz. Oontz.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.381
Oh, my god,
that was like pulling teeth.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.183
Please tell me
this gets easier.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.350
It doesn't,

11:59.352 --> 12:01.486
But the good news
is, you stop trying.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.887
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

12:02.889 --> 12:04.856
Hey, louis,
look at this.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.558
We're almost done.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.526
Yes, now all we need

12:08.528 --> 12:09.828
Is a flag for the top.
Oh!

12:09.830 --> 12:11.830
Oh, that's an old band-aid.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.364
Uh, how about this?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.567
We'll take this juice box,

12:15.569 --> 12:18.269
Flip it up here, and we'll put
the straw in like this,

12:18.271 --> 12:19.504
And ta-da!

12:19.506 --> 12:20.839
It's a flag!

12:20.841 --> 12:22.240
Look at this, louis!

12:22.242 --> 12:23.608
All hail

12:23.610 --> 12:27.045
The kingdom
of mount berry cooler!

12:27.047 --> 12:29.047
Alan:
Oh, oh,

12:29.049 --> 12:31.783
And here comes the king, uh,
returning home from battle.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.686
Walden: And what does
he have with him?

12:34.688 --> 12:36.087
The spoils of war,

12:36.089 --> 12:39.791
All the cheez-its in the land.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.593
Isn't this cool, louis?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.294
I want to go back inside.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.395
What?

12:44.397 --> 12:45.497
It's kind of hot,

12:45.499 --> 12:47.031
And I have to pee.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.333
Well, uh, you know,

12:48.335 --> 12:50.702
The ocean solves
both of those problems.

12:50.704 --> 12:53.171
O-o-okay.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.807
Okay,
w-w-we'll meet you inside.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.675
Hey, hey, berta,
he's coming in!

12:57.677 --> 12:58.943
Berta:
I've got him!

12:58.945 --> 13:02.013
Well, he hates me.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.047
What?

13:03.049 --> 13:04.649
We spent an hour

13:04.651 --> 13:06.050
Building a sand castle,

13:06.052 --> 13:07.719
And all he did was dig a hole.

13:07.721 --> 13:08.853
Who digs holes, alan?

13:09.889 --> 13:11.890
Prisoners, they want to escape.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.858
Oh, walden.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.628
Why are the pretty ones
always so crazy?

13:16.630 --> 13:18.296
Crazy? Am I?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.398
Really? What about earlier
when he didn't want to unpack?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.566
What was that all about?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.401
Nobody likes to unpack.
I hate it.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.236
Oh, is that why
you've never moved out?

13:25.238 --> 13:26.504
Wow.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.439
Um, misdirected anger,

13:28.441 --> 13:30.041
Your table is ready.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.410
You know what,
he doesn't want to be here.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.778
That's it.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.680
I-I knew I couldn't do this.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.682
Come on, walden,
put yourself in his shoes.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.185
He only spent
half a day with us.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.654
He's gonna need more time
to feel safe here.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.389
Yeah, right.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.457
More time.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.662
You think he'll love me
by tomorrow?

13:50.664 --> 13:51.930
Trust me, walden,

13:51.932 --> 13:53.832
He'll warm up to you
just like I did.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.133
Remember when you moved here?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.935
I wasn't sure
I wanted you to stay.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.436
I bought the house.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.171
And I made it a home.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.141
You're gonna have
to have more patience with him.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.844
Fine.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.512
Patience.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.113
(groans)

14:09.115 --> 14:10.615
Where you going?
The ocean.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.684
I'm hot and I got to pee.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.119
Well, be careful.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.122
He hates me.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.895
Oh, there he is.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.763
Did you put the seat down?

14:25.765 --> 14:27.365
I never put it up.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.969
Can I have a snack?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.704
Do we have snacks?

14:34.039 --> 14:36.107
Let's see.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.813
Wow.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.882
Take a load off.

14:47.319 --> 14:49.320
When a guy named charlie
lived here,

14:49.322 --> 14:52.323
I had to keep this cabinet

14:52.325 --> 14:55.059
Stocked with coke...

14:56.428 --> 14:59.030
...Co powder.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.066
Because he loved hot chocolate.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.801
I like hot chocolate.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.803
Not like he did.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.640
You like your crackers?

15:08.642 --> 15:09.741
Yeah.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.942
You don't talk much, do you?

15:12.711 --> 15:13.978
I get it.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.546
I was a quiet child.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.115
In fact,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.217
You and I have a lot in common.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.319
You like cheez-its, too?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.054
I do.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.390
But I was also raised

15:25.392 --> 15:27.425
In a whole bunch
of foster homes.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.626
You were?

15:28.628 --> 15:30.895
Yep, and I hated it.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.631
Moving around
all the time,

15:33.633 --> 15:35.867
Having to make friends
everywhere,

15:35.869 --> 15:39.037
And no one ever offered me
grape juice.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.007
Would you like to have
some grape juice?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.343
Yes, please.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.345
But I got to tell you,

15:47.347 --> 15:50.515
We both hit the lottery
with this place.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.917
Walden and alan

15:52.919 --> 15:54.852
Are the best.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.688
They're nice,

15:56.690 --> 15:59.223
They're fun,

15:59.225 --> 16:00.858
And guess what else.

16:00.860 --> 16:01.993
What?

16:01.995 --> 16:04.062
They're easy to fool.

16:06.031 --> 16:09.400
Last year, I went to
my granddaughter's graduation

16:09.402 --> 16:10.768
Seven times.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.037
(laughter)

16:13.039 --> 16:14.272
And with that face...

16:15.374 --> 16:17.542
...You can get anything
you want.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.211
Welcome to malibu, kid.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.681
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

16:23.683 --> 16:25.583
(knocking)

16:25.585 --> 16:27.485
Can I come in?

16:28.887 --> 16:30.989
What you drawing?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.790
Oh.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.425
A sand castle.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.728
That's ironic.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.930
Hey, uh, c-can we
talk for a second?

16:38.932 --> 16:40.565
Sure.
All right.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.733
Great.

16:41.735 --> 16:42.934
Look, uh...

16:44.737 --> 16:47.071
I know it's got
to be overwhelming being here

16:47.073 --> 16:50.141
And being in new places
all the time

16:50.143 --> 16:52.677
And with new people
and a new bed.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.878
I mean, heck, for all you know,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.380
There could be monsters
under the bed.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.315
There's monsters?
No.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.750
That's a bad example.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.419
In fact, before you got here,

17:01.421 --> 17:03.755
I de-monsterized
the entire house.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.626
My point is, is...

17:08.628 --> 17:10.261
I'm really glad
you're here, louis.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.765
I just want you
to be comfortable

17:13.767 --> 17:15.700
With alan and I.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.136
So if, so if there's anything
you ever need to talk about,

17:18.138 --> 17:20.238
Like anything at all,
you can come to me.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.242
So, that's all I have to say.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.646
Is there anything
you would like to say?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.181
Nope.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.783
Really.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.484
Just, like, just nothing?

17:33.486 --> 17:35.820
Like, nothing at all?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.522
Can I ask you a question?

17:37.524 --> 17:38.756
Uh, yes, of course.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.957
You can just, any time.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.092
That-that's why I'm here.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.360
So you just ask away.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.863
Is it okay that I can draw
by myself for a little while?

17:48.934 --> 17:51.002
Yeah.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.637
Okay, yeah.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.739
You-you want to be alone.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.140
I get that.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.076
That is not a problem.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.212
So, you want your space,

18:01.214 --> 18:03.681
And I shall give it to you.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.683
I will withdraw while you draw.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.019
(chuckles)

18:11.924 --> 18:13.991
Son of a bitch.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.297
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

18:23.368 --> 18:24.502
Walden?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.970
(gasps)
oh, god.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.939
Oh, louis.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.607
Oh, hey.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.109
(groans)

18:31.111 --> 18:32.643
What's going on, man?

18:32.645 --> 18:33.945
It's really late.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.214
I had a question, and you said
we could talk any time.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.949
Well, that's-that's just

18:37.951 --> 18:39.117
Something that people say,

18:39.119 --> 18:40.585
But, I, uh...

18:40.587 --> 18:43.187
Yeah, what-what's up?

18:43.189 --> 18:44.889
Am I gonna stay here with you?

18:44.891 --> 18:46.357
What do you mean?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.426
Sometimes I go to a house
for a weekend,

18:48.428 --> 18:49.827
But then I don't stay.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.063
Oh, buddy, that's what
you're worried about.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.132
Well, come here,
c-come here, okay?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.868
Jump up here.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.337
Hey,

18:59.339 --> 19:00.571
Listen.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.774
You can stay here as long
as you want to.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.743
Do you want to?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.746
Uh-huh. I really like it here.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.882
That's... Great.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.251
Really surprising,
but it's great.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.319
Hey,

19:15.321 --> 19:16.854
I'm not going anywhere,

19:16.856 --> 19:19.390
And as long as you want
to be here,

19:19.392 --> 19:20.825
You're not going anywhere,
either.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.829
And believe me, alan is gonna be
here longer than the both of us.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.665
So don't you worry.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.400
Thanks.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.835
So you really like it here, huh?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.437
All right, what was
the best part of the day?

19:33.439 --> 19:34.705
Both:
The cheez-its.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.141
Yeah.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.342
And I like berta.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.810
Berta's great,

19:39.812 --> 19:41.179
And you like me, too, right?

19:41.181 --> 19:43.314
Berta's so funny.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.249
Patience, patience.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.817
Listen,

19:46.819 --> 19:47.818
As long as you're happy.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.320
Cool.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.789
It is cool, louis.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.357
It's very cool.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.762
Where's alan?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.034
Look at us.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.735
We're like
the three musketeers.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.370
I don't think the
three musketeers

20:06.372 --> 20:08.005
Shared a bed.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.173
You don't know that.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.775
They were french.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.343
Where's berta?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.578
No.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.646
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:19.451 --> 20:20.551
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:20.553 --> 20:22.220
And then you pull the bird back,
uh-huh.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.455
And then let them go fly
into the pig's house.

20:24.457 --> 20:28.159
And then they roll around,
and then they explode.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.994
And then it's fun.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.762
Angry birds sounds like
it's fun.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.465
You know,
I bet the birds are so angry

20:34.467 --> 20:36.300
'cause they don't get
enough sleep.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.469
It's the pigs
who should be angry.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.972
The birds are always crashing
into their house,

20:40.974 --> 20:44.208
Even when they build them
out of ice or in space.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.910
I wonder if the pigs are
from three little pigs.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.745
That's messed up
because the wolf already broke

20:47.747 --> 20:50.181
Their old houses.

20:50.183 --> 20:54.252
Little help, alan?
(alan snoring)
