WEBVTT

00:10.078 --> 00:14.715
* Sleeping beauty,
where have you been? *

00:16.217 --> 00:18.652
* You should know

00:18.686 --> 00:23.657
* I'm counting on you here

00:25.826 --> 00:29.630
* Feels like

00:29.663 --> 00:33.401
* Clouds beneath your wings

00:33.434 --> 00:36.337
* It is night

00:36.370 --> 00:39.740
* You see it like it is

00:39.773 --> 00:41.742
* It is dark

00:41.775 --> 00:44.645
( coughing )

00:44.678 --> 00:48.616
* Have mercy on us all

00:48.649 --> 00:50.818
* You should know

00:50.851 --> 00:56.424
* I am counting on you here

00:56.457 --> 01:00.861
* His kiss

01:00.894 --> 01:04.765
* His kiss...

01:07.568 --> 01:09.837
* His kiss

01:09.870 --> 01:12.440
* His kiss...

01:22.516 --> 01:23.884
Nice shooting.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.553
Hey.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.388
Robin Brooks,
look at you.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.556
What's going on?
I didn't think

01:28.589 --> 01:30.724
U.S. Attorneys were allowed
to get their hands dirty.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.194
Well, you can't prosecute what
you don't understand, right?

01:33.227 --> 01:34.828
Wow, look at that.
That's a lot of gun, huh?

01:34.862 --> 01:38.566
Yeah, well, it gives me a chance
to actually hit something.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.334
( chuckles )
Look,

01:40.368 --> 01:41.702
I didn't get a chance
to thank you

01:41.735 --> 01:42.703
after the Jon Owens case.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.637
Ah, that's all right.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.873
No, your team handled
it all really low-key,

01:45.906 --> 01:49.277
and because of that I was able
to go forward with my gang case.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.478
Good. I'm glad it worked out.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.445
Yeah.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.148
So, do you always hang out

01:54.182 --> 01:55.816
at the gun range alone
on a Friday night?

01:55.849 --> 02:00.188
Well, clearly it's where
all the pretty girls show up.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.723
Agent Eppes, I don't think
I've been hit on

02:02.756 --> 02:03.724
at a gun range before.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.609
( cell phone rings )

02:25.913 --> 02:26.847
Eppes.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.720
What?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.822
Yeah.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.591
I'm on my way. Right.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.859
-What's wrong?
-I got to go.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.860
Are you okay?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.795
Yeah. I got to
get out of here.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.464
-( engine starts )
-Okay.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.333
I'll talk to
you later.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.300
Bye.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.603
( sirens wailing )

02:53.474 --> 02:54.775
ATF Agent Nikki Davis.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.810
Killed herself
two hours ago.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.512
Gunshot to the head.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.547
Who made the 911 call?

02:59.580 --> 03:02.850
LAPD uniform involved
in an unrelated foot pursuit

03:02.883 --> 03:05.786
heard what appeared
to be a gunshot.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.723
( garbled radio transmissions )

03:09.757 --> 03:10.691
( camera clicks )

03:13.327 --> 03:15.229
Agent Turner. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.301
Eppes, FBI.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.735
Sinclair.

03:23.837 --> 03:27.741
Look, I know any death
involving a federal officer

03:27.775 --> 03:28.942
is technically the FBI's,

03:28.976 --> 03:32.780
but she was
one of ours.

03:32.813 --> 03:36.684
So, I'd like the
handle on this.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.753
Agent Eppes?

03:39.787 --> 03:42.022
Look, just... I want her covered
as soon as possible.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.757
You got it?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.459
I said ATF wants
the investigation.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.694
Well, we're taking it.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.662
I'll keep you in the loop.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.703
CHARLIE:
We all use math every day,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.438
to predict weather,

03:57.471 --> 04:00.374
to tell time,

04:00.408 --> 04:03.911
to handle money.

04:03.944 --> 04:07.881
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.951
It's logic...

04:10.984 --> 04:13.454
rationality.

04:13.487 --> 04:17.658
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.534
DON:
Nikki may have been ATF,

04:26.567 --> 04:28.602
but I want her treated
like one of our own.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.837
Our responsibility
is to clear the death

04:29.870 --> 04:31.071
of any federal officer, right?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.440
You're not
handing this over?

04:32.473 --> 04:33.441
No.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.642
How we doing
on ballistics?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.511
Single round, matches her
duty weapon, a Sig Sauer 229.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.780
Tox screen?

04:39.813 --> 04:40.948
Oxycontin

04:40.981 --> 04:42.015
and Prozac.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.116
Prozac?

04:43.150 --> 04:46.754
Yeah. It's not that unusual
for a suicide victim.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.556
Any word on the husband?

04:48.589 --> 04:49.557
He's an ATF agent.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.592
What?

04:51.625 --> 04:52.593
Works fugitive
gun runners.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.794
On his way
back from Texas

04:53.827 --> 04:54.795
as we speak.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.796
I want him interviewed

04:55.829 --> 04:56.897
as soon as he lands, all right?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.174
So, I'm just wondering

05:07.207 --> 05:10.544
if this woman's death was a
suicide, why all the intensity?

05:10.578 --> 05:14.482
She's the third agent in
two years who killed themselves.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.716
So it's strictly professional?

05:18.686 --> 05:21.589
You knew her,
didn't you?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.391
Does say "behaviorist"

05:23.424 --> 05:24.492
on my job description.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.126
Yes, I knew her.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.862
Well, if you ever want to talk,
I'm number two on your Nextel.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.731
Thanks.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.900
I'm going to head
over to the ATF

05:32.933 --> 05:34.134
and interview her
whole team now.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.604
-Hi, Charlie.
-Hey.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.105
Take care of your
brother in there.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.542
CHARLIE:
What'd she mean by that?

05:41.575 --> 05:42.543
Nothing.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.412
Looks like
an ATF agent

05:44.445 --> 05:46.580
who I knew pretty well
killed herself, that's all.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.916
Oh. I'm really sorry.

05:48.949 --> 05:49.917
Yeah. Do you remember

05:49.950 --> 05:52.420
that kid who jumped off
the bridge last year?

05:52.453 --> 05:54.522
Yeah. Finn Montgomery.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.457
It looked like a suicide,
but you didn't think so, right?

05:56.490 --> 05:57.991
Right. I didn't think
he was capable of it.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.893
And why?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.695
His potential was unlimited.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.031
Good more than
outweighed the bad.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.099
But I was wrong.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.702
Well, do me a favor,
take a look at this file.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.938
Just tell me if there's
something doesn't add up,

06:10.971 --> 06:11.939
would you?

06:11.972 --> 06:13.106
Sure.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.414
( writing on chalkboard )

06:25.953 --> 06:27.721
Nothing like taking
stock of one's life.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.959
Bit safer from
a numerical standpoint.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.928
It isn't his life
Charlie's taking stock of.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.630
Okay, well, even easier still.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.667
A hundred people commit suicide
every hour.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.669
And 300 stars die every second.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.804
Yeah, this was a person.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.674
Nikki Davis--
she was an ATF agent.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.509
So, what, you're weighing
events in her life

06:48.542 --> 06:50.578
to determine the likelihood
of her suicide?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.145
I'm applying a modified
Holmes-Rahe stress test

06:52.179 --> 06:54.715
as a starting point.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.717
We're assigning
numerical values

06:56.750 --> 06:58.051
to certain events
in her life.

06:58.085 --> 06:58.919
LARRY:
Huh.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.455
Yeah, but how do you
rank such things?

07:01.489 --> 07:03.457
I mean, Christmas alone,
dinner with your in-laws

07:03.491 --> 07:05.225
could equal a death
in the family.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.561
I mean, depending
on your in-laws.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.729
Oh, she was
a par golfer,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.664
ran sub-three-hour
marathon times,

07:10.698 --> 07:13.033
and even worked at
the local Boys and Girls Club.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.702
All positive things.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.737
Yeah, and she was also
on antidepressants.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.007
What, they're handing out guns
to the clinically depressed?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.609
Depression is
a definite negative.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.744
But my cognitive emergence
studies have taught me

07:23.777 --> 07:25.946
that it's difficult,

07:25.979 --> 07:28.015
but not entirely impossible,
to quantify the variables

07:28.048 --> 07:30.684
that describe existing
human consciousness.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.553
And Don has asked you
to work on this?

07:32.586 --> 07:33.487
Why?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.722
He knew her.

07:34.755 --> 07:35.723
Yeah, he knew her,

07:35.756 --> 07:38.225
a long time ago.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.827
They hadn't
spoken in years,

07:39.860 --> 07:42.663
but I think he's really
bothered by this.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.899
Yeah, well, like I said,
leads me back to those stars.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.201
One dies and
disappears,

07:48.235 --> 07:50.771
and the whole cluster
feels the loss.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.743
( small explosion )

07:55.776 --> 07:57.244
ATF! Search warrant!

08:02.816 --> 08:03.684
Drop the gun!

08:03.717 --> 08:05.018
Drop it!

08:07.320 --> 08:08.789
( laughs )

08:08.822 --> 08:11.191
AGENT: Took a little time there,
didn't you?

08:11.224 --> 08:12.125
Nice, guys. Hey.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.093
TURNER: This is Agent Reeves
and Sinclair

08:13.126 --> 08:16.564
They're clearing
the inquiry on Nikki's death.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.698
Sorry for your loss.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.667
Fingernails so clean,

08:19.700 --> 08:20.534
he's got to be FBI.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.969
TURNER:
They're here to help, Agent Rho.

08:22.002 --> 08:22.736
So are you.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.572
WILSON:
Nikki was our leader,

08:24.605 --> 08:26.306
we lost her.
What else do you need to know?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.609
( chuckles )

08:28.642 --> 08:29.476
We'd like to know

08:29.509 --> 08:32.245
whether she seemed
depressed at all.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.081
Was something bothering her
more than usual?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.716
Nikki always had
a lot on her mind.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.217
Goes with the territory.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.086
We found some medications
on her bureau--

08:40.353 --> 08:42.155
pain killers, antidepressants.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.190
Is that what this is about?

08:43.223 --> 08:43.991
Some kind of FBI thing to try

08:44.024 --> 08:45.559
and drag her name
through the mud?

08:45.593 --> 08:47.227
We're just trying
to investigate.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.296
Yeah, well, I know all about
these kinds of investigations.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.998
And you can count me out.

08:51.031 --> 08:51.965
TURNER:
Agent Wilson.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.634
Look, she's upset, all right?
We all are.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.835
MEGAN:
We understand that.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.970
We're just trying to
sort some things out.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.110
Nikki hurt herself
pretty bad last year.

09:03.143 --> 09:03.977
On the job?

09:06.079 --> 09:07.147
Executing a warrant.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.916
RHO:
Messed up her knee real bad.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.584
Never took the time
to heal right.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.319
No rest for the wicked,
she used to say.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.588
Agent Rho...

09:16.023 --> 09:17.591
if you think of something,

09:17.625 --> 09:19.760
just let us know.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.861
You need anything else?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.329
We'll be in touch.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.131
Just give me a second.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.371
You know, you'll get
more power in your punch

09:31.404 --> 09:32.740
if you turn your foot into it.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.112
A lot of people think we should
still be sitting behind a desk.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.181
Must have been nice
having a female boss.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.187
Did you know she was
self-medicating?

09:49.122 --> 09:51.358
We were working a pretty heavy
bank robbery crew.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.392
Maybe she was
a little off,

09:52.425 --> 09:53.994
maybe the stress
was getting to her.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.764
I don't know.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.131
Wouldn't you say
taking your own life

09:58.165 --> 09:59.633
was more than
being a little off?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.704
I got a job
to do here.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.605
I have to ask somebody
these questions.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.609
She was having problems at home.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.312
With her husband?

10:12.345 --> 10:15.783
Two ATF agents maintaining
a relationship isn't exactly

10:15.816 --> 10:17.384
the easiest thing to do
in our business.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.385
Got it.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.653
How serious were the problems?

10:19.687 --> 10:22.155
Pretty serious, I think.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.692
Something he did
backed her into a corner.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.226
I don't know what it was,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.662
but she said she was thinking
of calling it quits with him.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.134
They don't call it eating
your gun for nothing, do they?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.872
MEGAN:
I don't know if

10:38.906 --> 10:40.340
you're going to
want to hear this,

10:40.373 --> 10:42.743
but after talking to
Nikki Davis's team,

10:42.776 --> 10:44.778
I do believe
that she killed herself.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.749
I'm not as convinced.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.183
I've been looking
through her file.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.853
Agent Davis was a leader
in her community,

10:52.886 --> 10:54.254
she was an outstanding agent.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.056
Who was suffering
from a bad depression.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.225
True, but look.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.393
CHARLIE:
Commendation after commendation.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.696
She just made supervisor.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.164
Strong parental support

11:04.197 --> 11:05.265
and siblings.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.735
All of this
should have outweighed

11:07.768 --> 11:10.771
any transitory depression.

11:10.804 --> 11:11.772
Here, look, figure skaters,

11:11.805 --> 11:13.340
when they perform a routine,

11:13.373 --> 11:15.843
the judges multiply the scores

11:15.876 --> 11:18.145
on the jumps
by a difficulty factor.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.480
If that difficulty factor's
large enough,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.449
and even with the mistakes
and the subsequent deductions,

11:22.482 --> 11:23.450
skaters can still

11:23.483 --> 11:24.451
win the competition.

11:24.484 --> 11:27.187
All the positive aspects
of Nikki Davis's life

11:27.220 --> 11:28.488
should have multiplied

11:28.521 --> 11:30.758
her natural coping ability.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.826
And so I think we should
look at this further.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.395
Charlie, look, if I'm going
to rule her death a homicide,

11:35.428 --> 11:37.330
I need more than
skating metaphors, you know?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.866
-I need evidence.
-We might have it.

11:38.899 --> 11:39.833
DAVID:
Nikki's husband's flight

11:39.867 --> 11:42.502
from Texas arrived,
only he wasn't on it.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.471
-What do you mean?
-I checked the manifest.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.006
He never got on the plane.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.975
Found out his wife's dead
and he didn't come home?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.810
Ran a trace on his cell.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.114
What's five-two? Mexico?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.282
DAVID:
Night of her death

11:55.315 --> 11:56.984
he was in Mexico City,
not in Texas

11:57.017 --> 11:58.852
like he was supposed to be.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.420
Also, I ran a
trace on her cell,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.422
all calls in the last 48 hours.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.791
Yeah, and?

12:03.824 --> 12:05.392
One number pops out;
it's on page two.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.831
Last person she
called was you, Don.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.142
DAVID: I rechecked
everyone's voice mail.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.376
She didn't
leave a message.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.377
I mean, I don't

12:24.411 --> 12:26.446
hear from her for years,
and then she calls me

12:26.479 --> 12:28.348
a few hours
before she kills herself?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.517
Well, maybe the kind of message
she was leaving,

12:30.550 --> 12:33.020
she didn't want to put
on an answering machine.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.322
And what's her husband doing
in Mexico?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.124
Credit cards show he made
a bunch of trips

12:37.157 --> 12:38.491
down there,
all to the same town,

12:38.525 --> 12:39.559
just south of the border.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.861
MEGAN:
He's working gun runners.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.864
Maybe it's an undercover
assignment.

12:43.897 --> 12:44.965
No. Not according to Turner.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.334
I mean, they thought
he was working a case in Texas.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.336
And if he is on the job, why is
he putting it on his own dime?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.504
I mean, especially
with his financial situation.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.974
What? What's that?

12:54.007 --> 12:54.975
Credit report shows

12:55.008 --> 12:57.410
he took a second mortgage out
on his house.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.946
Yeah, about six months ago,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.413
he started borrowing
against his pension.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.349
For what?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.184
I don't know, but whatever
he's buying down there,

13:04.217 --> 13:05.853
no, he's not using
the credit card for it.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.420
MEGAN:
Well, I'll say this for him.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.521
The man
gets results.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.491
One bust alone last year netted
two crates of M-16s.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.525
Look, just

13:12.559 --> 13:13.793
keep digging, all right?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.363
I mean, I want to know what the
guy was doing in Mexico, okay?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.365
All right.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.000
( sighs )

13:24.404 --> 13:25.405
Hey.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.908
-Hey.
-Wow.

13:27.941 --> 13:31.344
I can't remember the last time I
saw you just taking a break.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.380
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.349
I needed
to get outside.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.553
Yeah. Larry says that
you've been distracted.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.255
It's the
ATF Agent?

13:42.289 --> 13:44.391
Well, my research has revealed

13:44.424 --> 13:47.294
that law enforcement officers
are more likely

13:47.327 --> 13:50.430
to commit suicide
than civilians.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.299
Well, it's not really
surprising, is it?

13:52.332 --> 13:55.202
I mean, they're around
violence every day.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.604
They see things most of
us don't even know exist.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.973
They also have
a terrible track record

14:00.007 --> 14:02.309
at maintaining
relationships.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.510
Yeah. My parents
had a friend.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.412
He was a detective,
and, um, well,

14:05.445 --> 14:08.148
the last time I checked,
he was on his third wife.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.382
Really?

14:09.416 --> 14:12.452
He was always getting called
off in the middle of the night.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.055
He missed her science
fair, her school play.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.924
Everything, really.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.227
I worry about Don.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.995
Where his work takes him,

14:22.029 --> 14:25.498
how's he ever gonna
have a relationship?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.536
What?

14:29.569 --> 14:30.938
Nothing.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.639
It's just, I mean, we both know

14:32.672 --> 14:35.508
that you're not exactly the most
successful man in the world

14:35.542 --> 14:38.345
when it comes to maintaining
a personal relationship.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.579
Different.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.414
How?

14:41.448 --> 14:44.051
And Don has made
his work his life.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.053
So have you.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.122
What's even worse is, you've
made his work your life.

14:49.156 --> 14:52.993
Look who's talking.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.428
Look, we all have
professional commitments.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.397
But that doesn't mean
we're not responsible

14:57.430 --> 14:59.032
for the choices we make.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.568
Nothing is written
in stone, Charlie.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.469
Don can find somebody.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.972
I mean, he just has
to be willing to.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.098
Looking for evidence
or a keepsake?

15:32.499 --> 15:35.202
We've been looking all over
for you.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.369
My boss told me.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.505
Said you were handling
the investigation.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.273
Yeah, well, that's right.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.214
Looks like, uh...

15:47.247 --> 15:50.217
you and Nikki had a lot of fun
in New Mexico.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.619
Yeah, well, you know,
it was a long time ago.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.686
And you decided

15:53.720 --> 15:56.023
to handle her suicide, what,
for old time's sake?

15:56.056 --> 15:59.159
She called me a few hours
before she died.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.497
Called you?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.500
About what?

16:07.534 --> 16:08.735
I don't know, Richard.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.670
Why's your boss thinks
you were in Texas?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.505
Well, I don't think that's
really any of your concern.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.174
-Well, you're wrong about that.
-Hmm.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.442
I mean, you're in debt up
to your eyeballs.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.643
What are you doing running
around in Mexico?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.578
What are you doing, Eppes?

16:18.611 --> 16:20.747
I'm just doing my job here, man,
that's all I'm doing.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.149
No, you're not.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.584
You're trying to
clear your conscience.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.086
You left Nikki.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.320
Yes. So?

16:27.354 --> 16:30.623
Well, it took her a long time
to get over that, you know?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.092
It hurt her pretty bad.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.394
Look, let-let's just talk
about Mexico.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.032
They sell drugs there.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.300
Uh-huh. So, what,
you got a problem?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.334
The drugs weren't for me.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.569
I saw her tox screen.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.671
The only thing in her system
were prescription drugs, so...

16:44.704 --> 16:47.474
Well, they were experimental.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.641
Non-FDA approved.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.177
What does that mean?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.515
Nikki had cancer.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.550
What?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.219
( inhales deeply )

16:59.252 --> 17:01.554
She was diagnosed
about a year ago.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.495
( sighs )

17:08.528 --> 17:10.463
Hey, look, you know,
um, I didn't know.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.499
I mean, it's, it's not
in her file, so...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.234
That's because
we didn't tell anybody.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.602
ATF-- they, um...

17:15.635 --> 17:17.804
They would have put her
on leave for sure,

17:17.837 --> 17:19.606
and Nikki...

17:19.639 --> 17:21.608
wanted to keep working.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.645
If you don't believe me,

17:25.678 --> 17:26.646
wait for the autopsy.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.648
All right, just no more trips
to Mexico, okay?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.717
-Until this is over, all right?
-No more trips?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.353
No more trips?!

17:36.323 --> 17:38.491
How about just, um...

17:38.525 --> 17:40.727
How about just a simple
"I'm sorry for your loss,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.563
and I think
I'll be on my way"?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.434
DAVID: Like this whole thing
isn't weird enough,

17:47.467 --> 17:49.836
he runs into the
husband in her bedroom.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.872
What was he doing
at a crime scene alone?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.208
Here's the other
info from the scene.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.843
MEGAN:
Thank you. Hey, Charlie.

17:56.876 --> 18:00.480
Hey. I thought I'd stop by,
check up on my brother.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.781
Oh.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.184
Well, he'll be back
in a few minutes.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.653
Is this the radio communication
from that night?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.555
-DAVID: Yeah.
-Radio communication?

18:08.588 --> 18:11.391
Yeah. Some uniforms were chasing
a dealer.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.627
They called in for backup
and think they heard a gunshot.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.863
Are you saying
that this is a recording

18:16.896 --> 18:19.866
of the gunshot
that killed Nikki Davis?

18:19.899 --> 18:20.900
Maybe. It's pretty distorted.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.869
There's a whole lot
of other noises on there.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.404
How does this help?

18:24.437 --> 18:25.605
Well, if it is
the actual gunshot,

18:25.638 --> 18:27.374
it'll tell us the exact time
of death.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.508
Well, then,

18:28.541 --> 18:31.578
I can create an acoustic
fingerprint for this shooting.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.745
-From the CD?
-Yeah.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.483
Yeah, we... Look, we know
where the shot was fired, right?

18:36.516 --> 18:40.353
And assuming that
the sound was picked up

18:40.387 --> 18:42.189
by more than one radio,

18:42.222 --> 18:44.657
and that I can have access
to that same firearm,

18:44.691 --> 18:46.259
well, then, well, then, yeah.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.396
I can... I can recreate
the same variables.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.598
I'll make you a copy.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.239
ALAN:
Well, she's cute.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.607
Where was this taken?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.210
New Mexico.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.345
Why is it whenever
I see an old photo

19:05.378 --> 19:07.180
of myself, I look
totally different,

19:07.214 --> 19:08.581
and you look
absolutely the same?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.483
I mean, we-we have the
same genes, don't we?

19:10.517 --> 19:11.751
I don't
understand it.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.453
Yeah, well, she's dead.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.225
She's dead?

19:18.258 --> 19:20.327
Apparently a suicide.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.462
Oh.

19:24.897 --> 19:28.401
I'm sorry.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.338
You know, she called me
a few hours before.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.939
Why would she call you?

19:35.308 --> 19:37.944
( sighs )

19:37.977 --> 19:40.513
I don't know.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.615
Is there anything I can do?

19:44.317 --> 19:45.785
( quietly ):
She had cancer.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.420
Cancer?

19:47.454 --> 19:48.688
-I see.
-You know, I just...

19:48.721 --> 19:51.324
I have a hard time
getting my head around the fact

19:51.358 --> 19:54.327
that she couldn't find
some other way to...

19:54.361 --> 19:56.363
Yeah, I know.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.198
Yeah, I guess you would, right?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.403
Did you and Mom ever talk
about what would happen...?

20:03.436 --> 20:05.638
I never wanted to.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.540
I guess we were

20:07.574 --> 20:09.542
just lucky it never came
to that, but...

20:11.344 --> 20:15.515
I mean, if she had chosen to,
I would have understood.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.319
And I never would have
blamed myself.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.855
You understand
what I just said?

20:24.491 --> 20:25.492
Do you?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.360
Yeah.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.729
I got to get...

20:30.863 --> 20:32.932
See you later, Pop.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.268
Yeah, all right.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.370
( gunshot )

20:37.404 --> 20:39.472
LARRY:
No.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.507
LARRY:
No, it still doesn't match.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.742
Are you sure we set up these

20:42.775 --> 20:44.544
-outside microphones correctly?
-Double-checked them.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.413
Because nothing can
be discounted here.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.748
You know, an experiment
like this, there's such an

20:48.781 --> 20:50.383
extremely high level
of difficulty.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.518
Why is that?

20:51.551 --> 20:52.919
Because there was
an open window,

20:52.952 --> 20:54.120
the sound envelope

20:54.153 --> 20:57.056
and how the waves reached
the microphones-- they require

20:57.089 --> 20:58.858
truly complex
calculations.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.060
In an auditory sense,
a gunshot is fairly unique,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.963
in that it produces a short,
intense sound impulse.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.599
And how exactly does this
help me with a timeline?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.968
Well, if we can recreate the
original acoustic fingerprint,

21:09.001 --> 21:10.503
then we can match it

21:10.537 --> 21:13.340
to the sound recorded
by three separate LAPD officers.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.807
You know,
forensic acoustic experts

21:14.841 --> 21:17.544
did this exact same thing
in the JFK assassination inquiry

21:17.577 --> 21:18.545
to determine whether or not

21:18.578 --> 21:20.813
there really was a gunman
on that grassy knoll.

21:20.847 --> 21:25.318
Now, are we sure everything's
exactly the same as it was?

21:25.352 --> 21:26.453
-Yeah.
-LARRY: Hey, it just occurred

21:26.486 --> 21:28.421
to me. That shade--
was it open or shut?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.456
Does it matter?

21:29.489 --> 21:32.525
Cloth doesn't reflect
as much sound as glass.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.327
Look, as we fire
our test shots,

21:34.361 --> 21:37.730
this program will measure muzzle
blast and echo pattern, so

21:37.764 --> 21:39.932
it is essential
to get an acoustic match

21:39.966 --> 21:42.369
that nothing in this room
be changed,

21:42.402 --> 21:43.670
added to or eliminated.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.672
Tell, you what, let's...
let's just try it again?

21:45.705 --> 21:46.573
Okay.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.081
Ready?

21:55.114 --> 21:56.749
Yeah, go for it.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.317
( gunshot, beep )

22:00.853 --> 22:02.922
Not even close.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.692
All right, now, just
throwing it out there.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.360
Maybe it wasn't
a gunshot.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.561
No, it was a gunshot.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.929
LARRY:
Listen, the recorded waveform

22:09.962 --> 22:11.531
was bouncing around much more.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.665
Something is missing here.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.833
Are you sure

22:13.866 --> 22:16.869
that there wasn't some evidence
removed from this bedroom?

22:16.903 --> 22:19.439
A shell
casing maybe.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.574
And the bed sheet, that's it.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.109
No, that's just
fabric to fabric.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.577
According to
my variations,

22:24.611 --> 22:26.446
we're looking for
something much larger.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.815
Okay, her body, but

22:28.848 --> 22:31.618
if I understand correctly,
that's why I'm in the room

22:31.651 --> 22:32.619
firing from the bed,
right?

22:32.652 --> 22:34.487
Wait. David, where's Don?

22:34.521 --> 22:35.588
At the office.

22:39.859 --> 22:40.793
CHARLIE:
Sound waves.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.929
A gunshot produces a sound wave

22:42.962 --> 22:44.464
that travels, okay?

22:44.497 --> 22:47.066
If the wave hits
a reflective substance,

22:47.099 --> 22:48.134
let's say like rock,

22:48.167 --> 22:50.503
the air pressure
energy of the wave

22:50.537 --> 22:53.473
moves back in the opposite
direction towards you.

22:53.506 --> 22:54.541
An echo?

22:54.574 --> 22:55.642
Exactly, but those returning

22:55.675 --> 22:58.177
sound waves don't just allow us
to hear the gunshot.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.846
They tell us what we can't see.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.013
Like bats, for example.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.616
A bat emits a sound wave

23:03.650 --> 23:05.918
and then listens carefully
to the echo it produces.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.956
Now, by hearing how long it
takes for the echo to return,

23:09.989 --> 23:11.924
the bat's brain
automatically knows

23:11.958 --> 23:13.059
how far away an animal is.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.528
The larger the animal,
the louder the echo.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.631
If am animal is moving toward
or away from the bat,

23:18.665 --> 23:21.601
the pitch of the echo will be
raised or lowered accordingly.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.503
It's the Doppler Effect.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.772
All right. Yeah, so? And?

23:25.805 --> 23:29.942
And we recreated the acoustics
of Nikki Davis's room

23:29.976 --> 23:32.645
using the same communication
system the officers used,

23:32.679 --> 23:34.781
and we found that
there was something missing.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.948
Missing?

23:35.982 --> 23:37.684
Actually,
someone. I think

23:37.717 --> 23:40.419
that there was someone else in
that room when Nikki Davis died.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.562
All right,
wait, wait.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.063
Are you sure
about this?

23:51.097 --> 23:53.132
The acoustic pattern
clearly shows

23:53.165 --> 23:54.834
extra movement
and mass.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.769
Don, I'm telling you, there was
someone else in the room.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.538
DAVID:
It can't be Nikki's husband;

23:58.571 --> 23:59.371
we know he was in Mexico.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.072
Doesn't mean
he couldn't have helped

24:00.106 --> 24:01.240
plan his wife's murder, though.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.241
All right, here we go,

24:02.274 --> 24:03.075
I want to start over, all right?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.076
We're going to comb
his file, hers.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.912
I want to find anyone
with potential for this.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.880
People with a grudge
against Nikki is

24:07.914 --> 24:09.649
-going to be a long list, Don.
-That's all right.

24:09.682 --> 24:10.750
We've got informants,
people she's put behind bars.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.519
-Just tell me, his file's on
this table? -Right here.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.854
-This his?
-Yeah.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.789
Uh, wait a second.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.958
Based on what
I see here,

24:18.991 --> 24:20.627
I can help narrow that list down
a little.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.628
Why, what do you mean?
What's this?

24:21.661 --> 24:22.562
The forensics report.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.863
We've already been
through that, Charlie.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.231
Right, well, DNA samples

24:25.264 --> 24:27.734
were taken
from Nikki Davis's house.

24:27.767 --> 24:28.868
A few dozen, actually.

24:28.901 --> 24:29.836
It's a house, Charlie,

24:29.869 --> 24:31.671
anybody going in could
have left a trace--

24:31.704 --> 24:34.106
we have hair, fiber,
skin, fingerprints.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.908
That's exactly my point.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.009
Charlie, we ran the samples,
there was no matches.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.879
Yeah, and without a suspect,
it doesn't even help us.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.848
You guys are talking biology,
I'm talking probability.

24:41.881 --> 24:45.017
Look, 99.99% of our DNA
is the same.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.919
But that doesn't mean
we can't find markers

24:46.953 --> 24:48.821
that differentiate
one individual from another.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.990
Like genes associated
with a particular trait.

24:51.023 --> 24:51.891
That's exactly right.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.026
For example, we can
with high accuracy

24:54.060 --> 24:56.095
determine an
individual's origin:

24:56.128 --> 24:59.866
European, East African,
Sub-Saharan African.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.267
Fine. How does this help us?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.035
Cal Sci has
a DNA database.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.271
50,000 DNA samples,

25:05.304 --> 25:06.973
and the photos of the people
who donated them.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.808
I can run
a statistical matrix

25:08.841 --> 25:09.942
to find similarities between

25:09.976 --> 25:12.845
the samples found
at Nikki's house

25:12.879 --> 25:14.547
and the samples at Cal Sci.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.048
Wait a minute, are you saying
you can tell us

25:16.082 --> 25:17.584
what these DNA samples
would actually look like?

25:17.617 --> 25:18.885
To a reasonable probability.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.820
Well, go for it,
run it.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.223
MEGAN:
All right.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.958
So, the last six months,

25:25.992 --> 25:27.960
Nikki's primary focus
is investigating

25:27.994 --> 25:29.829
a series of armed robberies.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.199
Five months, five jobs,
$1.5 million.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.735
Guys move with
tactical precision.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.604
What was ATF doing on that case?

25:37.637 --> 25:38.905
Agent Rho said
the crew used

25:38.938 --> 25:40.039
military-quality weapons.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.908
Maybe ATF's handling
the trace.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.075
Was she having any luck?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.745
She had an informant
who linked these guys

25:45.778 --> 25:49.816
to an Aryan motorcycle gang:
the Outlaw Renegades.

25:49.849 --> 25:54.053
It's run by a guy
named Roy Mitchell.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.255
Looks like she put
surveillance on the gang

25:56.288 --> 25:57.690
based on information
from the informant.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.692
Anything come of it?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.894
Her team spotted the Outlaw
Renegades outside a bank,

26:01.928 --> 26:05.164
then ATF waited
on these guys.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.236
How come there were
no arrests made?

26:10.269 --> 26:12.271
They never went inside the bank.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.008
Someone tipped these guys off.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.209
Right, they knew
they were being watched,

26:17.243 --> 26:18.611
that's why they didn't
go inside.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.079
Maybe the informant was
playing both sides.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.786
LARRY:
Isolating a person from DNA

26:26.819 --> 26:28.287
linked to
a government database?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.156
I can't help but wonder,
is this even ethical?

26:30.189 --> 26:34.026
Oh, it's no different than
fingerprints or driver licenses.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.228
Listen, I see a very
real distinction.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.065
Driver licences provide
a person's identity,

26:39.098 --> 26:40.767
but DNA, that contains

26:40.800 --> 26:42.869
the essence of our history,

26:42.902 --> 26:44.136
glimpses into
our genetic future.

26:44.170 --> 26:48.875
I'm merely using DNA information
that's already been collected

26:48.908 --> 26:50.743
to approximate
the genetic description

26:50.777 --> 26:52.211
of an ATF agent's killer.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.880
Oh, I agree,
in this case, you know,

26:53.913 --> 26:56.282
the intentions is pure,
it's admirable, even.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.886
But, you know, DNA can be used
for much less noble pursuits.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.288
I mean,
predetermination, Charles.

27:02.321 --> 27:05.091
Think about it, once we're
trapped within these databases,

27:05.124 --> 27:06.993
our employers,
our insurance companies,

27:07.026 --> 27:07.827
you know, they can use

27:07.860 --> 27:08.895
our genetic codes,

27:08.928 --> 27:11.731
and not to glimpse our futures,
but to limit them.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.974
( knock at door )

27:23.810 --> 27:24.844
Agent Eppes.

27:24.877 --> 27:25.745
Nice to see you.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.914
Robin, I need a favor.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.882
Really? Oh, you could have
just called.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.817
Oh, right, but I forgot,

27:30.850 --> 27:32.685
apparently you don't know
how to do that.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.420
No, no, no, listen to me,
it was a friend of mine, okay?

27:34.453 --> 27:36.889
An agent, an ATF agent
was killed and, uh...

27:36.923 --> 27:38.725
I mean, that's
the only reason I took off.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.328
Wow, I feel really silly.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.230
No, don't, please.

27:46.766 --> 27:47.666
How can I help?

27:47.700 --> 27:49.468
Well, she was working
with an informant

27:49.501 --> 27:51.804
who was giving her intel
about the Outlaw Renegades.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.840
Yeah, I know them,
our office has wiretaps on them.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.775
Well, I figure
the warrants are based on

27:55.808 --> 27:56.843
those tips.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.077
I need to know
who it is.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.111
Those wiretap applications

27:59.145 --> 28:00.212
are sealed by
court order.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.881
Look, the ATF isn't
going to help me

28:01.914 --> 28:03.816
because I took the investigation
away from them, so...

28:03.850 --> 28:04.817
Well, it's not my case.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.455
But I'll talk to the AUSA
that's handling it,

28:09.488 --> 28:10.923
and... see what I can find out.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.424
All right.
I appreciate that.

28:13.993 --> 28:17.363
This woman was close to you?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.866
You know what? I'm sorry,
that is none of my business.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.100
It's all right.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.735
You know,
I'll tell you about it.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.003
All right. Well, you know
where I work, right?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.271
Yeah. Thanks.

28:30.977 --> 28:33.112
-He's an Outlaw Renegade, right?
-Yeah.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.181
Nikki arrested him
last year?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.049
Yeah, she flipped him,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.218
he's been giving intel to
the U.S. Attorney's Office.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.219
He lives alone,

28:40.252 --> 28:41.287
doesn't he?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.222
Two cars
in the driveway.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.862
( knocking )

28:49.896 --> 28:52.865
FBI!
Looking for Darryl Clark!

28:55.935 --> 28:57.837
Darryl Clark?

29:00.039 --> 29:03.275
FBI!

29:03.309 --> 29:05.878
MEGAN:
I'll take the back.

29:07.546 --> 29:10.316
Darryl Clark?

29:15.354 --> 29:16.923
DAVID:
Don!

29:20.526 --> 29:22.528
He's been dead
for a while.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.967
MEGAN:
Guys? Out back.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.902
It's Nikki Davis's
husband.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.004
Two shots, center mass.

29:33.339 --> 29:36.442
He wasn't just killed,
he was executed.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.253
All right, so we know
Nikki's source was

29:47.286 --> 29:49.521
giving her intel
on the Renegades, right?

29:49.555 --> 29:50.823
DAVID:
Right, they must have found out

29:50.857 --> 29:51.958
he was a rat
and they took him out.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.125
Yeah, but what
about the husband?

29:53.159 --> 29:54.160
Why kill him?

29:54.193 --> 29:55.527
Yeah, and what's
he even doing there?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.329
DAVID: He's probably following
the same trail we were.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.464
He wanted to know

29:58.497 --> 29:59.598
if the informant was playing

29:59.631 --> 30:00.599
both sides, if he betrayed her.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.169
What, he went to avenge
the wife's death, right?

30:03.202 --> 30:05.604
You know, Annie Wilson,
the girl on Nikki's team,

30:05.637 --> 30:09.141
told me their marriage
was in trouble.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.577
She said
something, uh...

30:11.610 --> 30:14.113
"Something the husband did
backed her into a corner."

30:14.146 --> 30:16.015
You think he could
have been involved?

30:16.048 --> 30:18.517
Well, the guns the robbery crew
uses are military grade.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.052
And Davis definitely
had access to those.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.620
Now, he recovered
those assault rifles

30:21.653 --> 30:22.654
in that bust
last year.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.356
MEGAN: Right, and they're in
financial trouble

30:24.390 --> 30:25.624
from the
wife's illness.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.459
Maybe he thought selling
the guns would help her.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.096
Nikki finds out, she has
no one else to turn to...

30:30.129 --> 30:31.163
then she calls you.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.298
MEGAN:
And gets killed before

30:32.331 --> 30:33.632
she has a chance
to do it again.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.067
DAVID:
Exactly.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.903
All right, so I want
24/7 surveillance

30:36.936 --> 30:38.204
on everyone in this photo.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.906
And this guy, Mitchell,
pops out of his hole,

30:39.939 --> 30:42.008
I want to know it.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.578
-Hello?
-Oh, hey.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.314
Am I interrupting
something?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.983
Just another Fleinhardt
doomsday prophecy.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.952
Come on, you make me sound
like Chicken Little.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.186
I was merely
advising Charles

30:54.220 --> 30:56.622
as to the dangers of unleashing

30:56.655 --> 30:58.424
a genie
from a bottle.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.993
He's thrilled with the idea
of cataloging DNA.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.329
Well, why, Larry, do you
have something to hide?

31:03.362 --> 31:06.665
No, my DNA is pure
as the driven snow.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.799
Then what's the problem?

31:07.833 --> 31:10.636
The problem is, once something
is out of the bottle,

31:10.669 --> 31:12.404
it is out of the bottle
for all time.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.372
The bottle?

31:14.540 --> 31:15.541
What? The bottle.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.408
That's a useful metaphor.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.445
Right. Listen up.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.480
I've identified several groups

31:21.513 --> 31:24.116
of genetic markers
called haplotypes,

31:24.150 --> 31:26.085
and now I need
a set of algorithms

31:26.118 --> 31:29.121
to compare them against
the Bio department's photo base.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.290
And these algorithms can
help you identify the people

31:31.323 --> 31:34.193
who left traces of DNA
in this agent's house?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.928
Like a blueprint for a home.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.964
The DNA that builds a person
is like

31:37.997 --> 31:40.199
the bluprints
that build tract houses.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.601
A majority of the
characteristics of each home--

31:42.634 --> 31:45.704
roof, dimensions and style--
is exactly the same,

31:45.737 --> 31:48.107
but there are a small number
of things,

31:48.140 --> 31:50.676
like color, landscaping and,
say, window coverings,

31:50.709 --> 31:53.479
that makes each home--
like a person-- unique.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.313
With a little luck,

31:54.346 --> 31:57.583
I may be able to put
a statistical face

31:57.616 --> 31:59.685
on all of Don's samples.

31:59.718 --> 32:03.489
It's like some
"bizarro" DNA world.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.692
DON:
When I was at Quantico,

32:06.725 --> 32:11.230
I remember all this talk
about pride

32:11.263 --> 32:13.132
and integrity...

32:13.165 --> 32:14.733
I remember holding
John Dillinger's gun.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.203
Yeah, but they never seemed to
tell you about cases like this.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.604
I mean, here's my friend and...

32:18.637 --> 32:22.274
I mean, she's murdered,
you know, she's miserable...

32:22.308 --> 32:24.743
she's in yet another
bad relationship.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.113
Come on, Donnie, you're
projecting now, aren't you?

32:27.146 --> 32:28.380
No, I don't
think so.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.748
I mean, I don't know
anyone in my game

32:29.781 --> 32:31.083
who's got a really
good relationship.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.219
Donnie,
that can't be true.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.753
Well, it is.
I mean, I tell you stuff,

32:34.786 --> 32:35.854
but you don't know
the half of it, trust me.

32:35.887 --> 32:38.590
-How come I don't find that
comforting? -It's hard.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.260
You come home and someone says,
"How was your day?"

32:41.293 --> 32:43.562
And you're like, "Well, I saw a
decapitated kid, how was yours?"

32:43.595 --> 32:44.630
Well, I mean, if you
can't talk about it,

32:44.663 --> 32:45.631
how are you going to feel

32:45.664 --> 32:46.665
any better than you do now?

32:46.698 --> 32:48.334
Which is why

32:48.367 --> 32:50.269
there is nobody at home
waiting for you.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.437
Look, even when I could have had
good relationships,

32:51.470 --> 32:52.438
I screwed them up.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.605
What does that mean,

32:53.639 --> 32:55.307
damned if you do,
and damned if you don't?

32:55.341 --> 32:56.408
Yeah.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.414
What if you didn't sabotage
your next relationship?

33:02.448 --> 33:03.382
Yeah? What does
that mean?

33:03.415 --> 33:04.350
I mean, what if you gave

33:04.383 --> 33:06.318
the next woman that
you meet a real shot?

33:06.352 --> 33:08.254
Look, Dad, it's easier
said than done...

33:08.287 --> 33:10.322
Donnie, what's the worst
that can happen?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.191
I'll tell you.

33:12.224 --> 33:15.061
The relationship fails, right?

33:15.094 --> 33:16.762
-( cell phone rings )
-So then what?

33:16.795 --> 33:18.497
Then you're back where
you are right now.

33:18.530 --> 33:22.168
But the only difference is,
instead of being afraid,

33:22.201 --> 33:23.535
you took a chance.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.071
( cell phone continues ringing )

33:26.172 --> 33:27.706
Eppes.

33:32.111 --> 33:35.614
LAPD undercover just bought
some dope about an hour ago.

33:35.647 --> 33:38.050
ID'd Roy Mitchell, leader
of the Outlaw Renegades,

33:38.084 --> 33:39.118
-on the couch.
-How many inside?

33:39.151 --> 33:40.119
Two plus Mitchell.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.153
We'll come through
the backyard,

33:41.187 --> 33:42.254
take them by surprise.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.689
What do you say, boys,
let's do it.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.656
( guns being cocked )

34:13.852 --> 34:15.121
( glass shattering )

34:17.189 --> 34:17.789
Hey!

34:17.823 --> 34:20.259
We got a runner!

34:24.496 --> 34:26.398
FBI! Don't move!

34:27.633 --> 34:32.771
( electrical zapping )

34:38.610 --> 34:40.779
You got nothing on me.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.648
Well, how about
two dead federal agents?

34:42.681 --> 34:44.650
Which qualifies you for
special circumstances

34:44.683 --> 34:46.518
and a lethal injection.

34:46.552 --> 34:47.553
Yeah, you have any evidence?

34:47.586 --> 34:48.520
What, you mean like

34:48.554 --> 34:49.221
Nikki Davis' husband

34:49.255 --> 34:49.621
supplying you guys with guns?

34:49.655 --> 34:50.156
Is that what

34:50.189 --> 34:50.656
we're talking about?

34:50.689 --> 34:52.691
Who's Nikki Davis?

34:52.724 --> 34:54.326
She was the ATF agent
working Darryl Clark.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.327
You know who
that is, right?

34:55.361 --> 34:56.795
DON: Yeah, he was cooperating
with the ATF.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.697
Did you know that?

34:58.730 --> 35:00.699
Ah, can't trust
anybody nowadays, can you?

35:00.732 --> 35:01.467
You killed him.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.801
Just like you killed
Richard Davis

35:02.834 --> 35:03.502
when he showed up.

35:03.535 --> 35:06.572
Sorry. Not ringing any bells.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.274
DON: Look, you got one chance,
you hear me?

35:08.307 --> 35:10.842
One chance to save your life.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.811
MITCHELL:
All right, look,

35:12.844 --> 35:14.480
you guys got pictures of me
killing somebody,

35:14.513 --> 35:15.914
feel free to
let me know.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.185
Other than that,
we got nothing to talk about.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.919
ROBIN:
Don, he's right.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.654
What we have
isn't enough to flip him.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.190
Well, he's involved,
all right?

35:24.223 --> 35:26.292
There's no doubt in
my mind he's involved.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.693
I can't hold him.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.161
Well, you can't
cut him loose.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.762
We don't have
probable cause.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.198
Nothing ties him to
either crime scene.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.632
Look, I'll lose
his paperwork, all right?

35:33.665 --> 35:37.369
I cannot let the guy go, Robin!

35:37.403 --> 35:39.738
Look, Don, I don't know
what this woman meant to you,

35:39.771 --> 35:42.708
but I doubt that she would
want you to compromise yourself.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.413
Neither do I.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.424
We'll put him
under surveillance.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.658
Eventually, he's
gonna make a mistake.

35:59.691 --> 36:00.892
That's not good enough, Megan.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.828
I'm sorry, it's not.

36:02.861 --> 36:03.829
CHARLIE:
Don!

36:03.862 --> 36:04.830
I got your guys.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.232
Or your guy.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.399
Or whatever.
I got 'em.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.334
What?

36:08.367 --> 36:09.735
Your DNA samples.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.803
I was looking for major
continental groups

36:11.837 --> 36:12.671
and searching for matches.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.406
It's actually something
that Larry said.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.507
That I shouldn't
be looking

36:15.541 --> 36:16.742
at specific physical
characteristics,

36:16.775 --> 36:18.744
I should be adjusting
my algorithm

36:18.777 --> 36:20.279
to identify origins.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.282
So, I went back to the
Cal Sci's DNA database

36:23.315 --> 36:24.816
and I found samples

36:24.850 --> 36:26.518
that most closely resembled
the biogeographical ancestry

36:26.552 --> 36:27.753
of the eight
DNA samples

36:27.786 --> 36:29.488
that were pulled
from Nikki Davis's house.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.823
And I approximated the
genetic probability

36:31.857 --> 36:33.892
of the samples'
likeness.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.827
Okay, how do we know
which one's the killer, Charlie?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.529
We don't--
well, not for certain.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.564
But we can apply probabilities.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.399
CHARLIE: I mean, look, we
know that there were

36:40.432 --> 36:41.433
no fingerprints
on that gun,

36:41.467 --> 36:42.834
so we can assume
that the killer

36:42.868 --> 36:43.769
wore gloves.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.771
So we can eliminate
all secretion-based

36:45.804 --> 36:48.674
DNA samples from hands.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.975
DON:
What, we get these three?

36:50.008 --> 36:51.443
Wait a minute.

36:51.477 --> 36:52.478
What is it, David?

36:52.511 --> 36:54.713
One of these representations.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.416
Does this remind you of someone?

36:57.449 --> 36:58.584
Agent Rho
from Nikki's team?

36:58.617 --> 36:59.651
Yeah,
that's pretty close.

36:59.685 --> 37:02.454
But why would someone
on Nikki's team want her dead?

37:02.488 --> 37:03.922
Bank robbery detail
described them as moving

37:03.955 --> 37:05.824
with military
precision, right?

37:05.857 --> 37:07.926
Yeah, and Rho was
a former Navy Seal.

37:07.959 --> 37:08.994
DAVID: Mitchell wasn't leading
this crew,

37:09.027 --> 37:10.228
it was Rho's.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.564
Call Special Ops; I want Rho
under tight surveillance ASAP.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.708
ATF has Rho out on
a training scenario.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.809
The location's
undisclosed.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.444
They're pulling a job,
I know it.

37:25.477 --> 37:26.412
They're pulling a job.

37:59.611 --> 38:00.712
( tires squealing )

38:08.354 --> 38:09.621
Get 'em up, now!

38:15.561 --> 38:16.962
Fire in the hole!

38:34.079 --> 38:35.313
No, don't shoot!

38:42.120 --> 38:43.522
Shoot him!

38:49.561 --> 38:50.929
( sirens wailing )

38:52.998 --> 38:54.633
Damn it, Feds are on to us!

38:54.666 --> 38:55.867
Give me suppression fire!

38:55.901 --> 38:57.903
( automatic gunfire )

39:13.419 --> 39:14.420
Protect our flank!

39:23.995 --> 39:25.897
DON:
Cover me! Watch for crossfire!

39:51.857 --> 39:54.860
( helicopter flying overhead )

40:32.898 --> 40:35.000
( sirens wailing
helicopter whirring )

40:38.103 --> 40:39.838
( groans )

40:42.040 --> 40:42.908
Don't do it!

40:42.941 --> 40:44.743
Don't even think about it!

40:44.776 --> 40:46.545
Get that hand up!
Get it up!

40:48.647 --> 40:51.149
Oh, thank you.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.151
Okay, pizza's here.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.686
Peppers and onions?

40:54.720 --> 40:57.756
Uh, no, sausage.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.858
Don's not coming over?

40:59.891 --> 41:02.994
I called; immediately
goes to voice mail.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.030
What?

41:05.063 --> 41:06.865
What?

41:06.898 --> 41:09.868
Three agents cracked, Dad--

41:09.901 --> 41:12.538
Nikki Davis,

41:12.571 --> 41:14.973
her husband and Agent Rho.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.808
I mean, even his crimes
can be traced

41:16.842 --> 41:17.743
to the pressure he was under.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.779
What do you think,
Don's going to crack?

41:20.812 --> 41:22.213
He lives alone,
and there are times

41:22.247 --> 41:23.515
we don't see him for days.

41:23.549 --> 41:24.516
Who knows what he's doing?

41:24.550 --> 41:25.684
Charlie, there's
one thing I know

41:25.717 --> 41:26.885
about your brother: he always

41:26.918 --> 41:27.986
knows how to have a good time.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.988
( sighs )

41:30.021 --> 41:32.090
What?

41:32.123 --> 41:34.593
You're not seriously
worried, are you?

41:34.626 --> 41:37.696
That formula I was working on,

41:39.030 --> 41:41.166
I ran it against his life.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.968
( laughs )

41:43.001 --> 41:44.002
You know, you're
worse than me.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.003
You realize that?

41:45.036 --> 41:47.606
He's going to be okay.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.975
Yeah, well, I knew
that a long time ago.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.244
Most compelling reason:
strong ties to his family.

41:53.278 --> 41:55.847
And apparently,
they to him, right?

41:57.949 --> 41:59.951
Still, you ever wonder
where he disappears to?

41:59.985 --> 42:01.787
He doesn't disappear.
He's, uh...

42:01.820 --> 42:02.721
Turns his cell phone off.

42:02.754 --> 42:06.024
Oh, all right, so he disappears.

42:07.893 --> 42:11.196
He's going to be fine.

42:12.998 --> 42:14.532
He's going to be fine.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.948
( knocking at door )

42:37.055 --> 42:38.189
Agent Eppes.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.558
Counselor.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.565
This is a surprise.

42:50.301 --> 42:52.237
Yeah.
