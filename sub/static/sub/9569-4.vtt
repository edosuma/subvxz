What's going on, bro?

00:04.760 --> 00:08.280
I think maybe she can't do it.
Be with someone.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.560
Come with me.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.960

- This is it, kid.
- Stop it!

00:19.120 --> 00:21.520
Don't ever come back.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.960

01:48.080 --> 01:51.320
I said your dad's prepared
a brainy breakfast.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.320
He read that the optimum pre-exam

Where you going?!

02:17.043 --> 02:18.080

Er, yeah, it was... it was fine.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.360
What?

05:57.520 --> 06:01.740
We got a call from the college
to say you left early.

06:01.860 --> 06:05.280
- What, so you just let me lie to you?
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry about that.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.840
Cool it, both of you.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.900
I think we just all need to talk.

Grief.

06:37.780 --> 06:41.720
I've had a flick through.
It's quite helpful.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.240
It might just make things
a bit easier,

06:44.400 --> 06:48.300
cos they've been difficult
for everyone, to be honest.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.900
And if you'd like to talk to us,
or a counsellor even...

06:53.020 --> 06:54.780
No. No counsellors, no way.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.100
Franky,
just hear your dad out on this...

06:57.220 --> 06:58.880
There she goes...

06:59.040 --> 07:01.520
Yeah, she fucking does, and what?

07:01.680 --> 07:05.580
Your dad just meant that we
miss you, we miss talking to you.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.860
We're supposed to be a family,
for Christ's sake!

07:08.980 --> 07:12.120
What, and that's my fault, too,
is it? Great(!)

07:12.280 --> 07:13.860
No, Franky...

07:13.980 --> 07:17.980
God almighty!

to talk, can I come over?

07:35.540 --> 07:38.420
'Yes! Yes! Yes!'

07:38.540 --> 07:42.540
Fuck off.

07:52.100 --> 07:56.100
Fancy fucking off somewhere?

08:01.740 --> 08:03.657
She died? Fuck.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.300
Yeah, that's what I just said.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.420
She was nice.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.560
She was awesome.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.620
I keep seeing the crash...
Over and over...

08:16.420 --> 08:19.540
- You got to let shit go, Franky.
- Yeah, but it won't let me go.

08:19.660 --> 08:23.660
And I'm fucking sick of it,
and I just feel like...

08:24.460 --> 08:28.460
Exploding.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.520
So is this where
you take your "bitches",

08:39.679 --> 08:43.059
or whatever boys like you do?

08:43.179 --> 08:46.220
What does that mean?
What could you mean?

08:46.340 --> 08:48.960
Well, just so you know,
I'm not gonna be one, OK?

08:49.120 --> 08:53.020
OK.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.300
I brought you here
cos you make my brain come,

08:56.420 --> 08:59.720
my heart jump and my prick hard.

09:01.020 --> 09:02.000

09:02.160 --> 09:04.920
Why pussy about?

09:05.080 --> 09:06.180

'Franky, say something, please.
I'm sorry I haven't phoned,

12:46.060 --> 12:48.020
'but things are so fucked here.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.660

'and can't come back and
I really fucking miss you.

13:03.380 --> 13:07.380
and you left her...
and now she's dead.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.720
'It wasn't my fault!'

13:08.880 --> 13:12.040
Well, whose was it then?

13:12.200 --> 13:16.140
'If you hadn't started flirting
with that fucking psycho...'

13:18.660 --> 13:22.660

13:46.740 --> 13:50.740
Mine got ripped...
Who were those guys at the pub?

13:51.180 --> 13:54.760
Just some small-time pricks that
think they can come and run things.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.360
You showed 'em, though. Shit.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.420
Fighter!

14:02.740 --> 14:03.840
Fuck me, flyweight, you are pretty.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.320
Shut up.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.160
You gonna make me?

14:08.320 --> 14:12.220
Maybe...

14:21.780 --> 14:25.780
I have to go.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.700
No, you don't.

14:28.820 --> 14:33.495
Yes, I do.
I've got to go revise before college.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.420
Fuck college.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.980
I want to, but...
I've fucked up one exam already.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.440
Pussy.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.460
I'll see you soon, flyweight.

15:26.020 --> 15:29.060
Oh, here she comes.
Who does she think she is?

15:29.180 --> 15:32.680
Way to go. Again(!)

15:32.840 --> 15:34.680
What do you mean, "again"?

15:34.840 --> 15:37.020
Your outstanding taste in men.

15:37.140 --> 15:40.240
As if it hadn't caused enough
devastation already.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.300
What the fuck did you just say?

15:46.500 --> 15:50.500
You think the crash was my fault,
don't you? You blame me.

15:52.920 --> 15:56.820
What the fuck is wrong with you?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.700
Jesus, Franky - Luke?

16:07.820 --> 16:08.980
How did you find him?

16:09.100 --> 16:10.700
Our eyes met over an eight ball.

16:10.820 --> 16:13.500
Yeah, well, I just spoke to Matty
and you're torturing him.

16:13.620 --> 16:14.380
Whatever.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.600
Fuck does that mean?

16:16.760 --> 16:17.880
Look, you're his girlfriend...

16:18.040 --> 16:21.940
I'm no-one's fucking girlfriend,
all right, and he left me, remember?

16:22.980 --> 16:26.660
Yeah, I know.
But he's only got us now.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.780
No, Nick, he's only got you.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.060
Phones to the front, if you will!

16:59.180 --> 17:00.720
Give me it.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.600

but please be seated.

Not feel bad about things.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.980
What things?

18:27.100 --> 18:30.300
Just things that you do.

18:30.420 --> 18:33.780
You saw me. I saw you.

18:33.900 --> 18:37.900

crashed and...

18:39.680 --> 18:42.660

Don't tear yourself up about it.

18:49.020 --> 18:53.020
None of that shit matters anymore,

18:54.080 --> 18:57.980
It's done.

What's that, Latin for piss off?

20:58.320 --> 21:01.820
No. For your father demanding a

bloody grateful for...

you've got a nice house over there?

23:14.640 --> 23:18.640
Can you just fuck off
and leave me alone, please?

23:20.840 --> 23:24.040
Come on, Franks,
why aren't you at home?

23:24.160 --> 23:28.160
Because I don't belong there anymore.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.920

turns to shit.

talking to me anyway?

the green light to adopt,

41:26.120 --> 41:30.040
we planned on taking on
a much younger child.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.760
And then Geoff saw your photo,

41:34.880 --> 41:38.880
you peaking out from underneath that
god-awful ski-hat you used to wear,

41:40.760 --> 41:44.640
remember?

41:44.760 --> 41:47.640
And then the first time we saw you,

41:47.920 --> 41:54.133
sat drawing away
like you did, head-down...

41:55.320 --> 41:59.320
... we knew then that you were for us.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.320
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.240

42:06.360 --> 42:08.760
the world had already forgotten
about you,

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
and he wasn't gonna let that happen.

in this world. OK?
