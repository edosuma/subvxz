02:13.048 --> 02:15.349
When the blazing sun is gone.

02:15.383 --> 02:17.317
When he nothing shines upon.

02:17.319 --> 02:19.252
When he nothing shines upon.

02:19.303 --> 02:24.024
Then you shine your little light.

02:24.075 --> 02:26.877
Twinkle, twinkle in the night.

02:26.911 --> 02:30.363
Then the traveler in the dark...

02:32.183 --> 02:36.086
thanks you for your little spark.

02:36.120 --> 02:40.207
He could not see which way to go...

02:40.241 --> 02:43.660
If you did not twinkle so.

02:43.711 --> 02:45.912
I am telling you, there is no way that
Minx would have let this happen, sir.

02:45.914 --> 02:49.140
Wes, over 50 people saw her
burn the president's daughter.

02:49.141 --> 02:50.214
I'm very... I'm very
aware of the situation.

02:50.313 --> 02:51.397
It's the same burn mark

02:51.486 --> 02:54.253
that was found on
Dr. Benavidez, Thomas Harcourt.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.421
- [Sighs]
- How do you explain that?

02:55.472 --> 02:58.057
I don't know, but I... I know there's
another explanation for this.

02:58.092 --> 02:59.859
Yeah, one of these kids is inhabited...

02:59.861 --> 03:00.993
not my daughter!

03:06.133 --> 03:07.900
Let me talk to her. I'll...

03:07.902 --> 03:11.037
Do you really think
you're an impartial judge?

03:14.091 --> 03:16.242
Claire.

03:16.276 --> 03:17.610
- Please. Please.
- Wes, I can't.

03:17.661 --> 03:19.779
- I can't do... I can't be the one.
- Okay, just... just go...

03:19.781 --> 03:23.382
just go and ask her
what really happened, okay?

03:23.433 --> 03:24.350
Please.

03:24.401 --> 03:27.153
You're the only one I trust.

03:37.948 --> 03:40.232
[Keys jingle]

03:58.101 --> 04:00.386
You can leave.

04:09.863 --> 04:12.498
[Sighs]

04:15.035 --> 04:17.369
Minx, I need to talk to you.

04:17.370 --> 04:20.372
<i>If I can understand</i>
<i>what happened out there,</i>

04:20.406 --> 04:24.710
<i>what happened to Cassandra, I can help you.</i>

04:24.744 --> 04:27.546
[Scoffs]

04:27.548 --> 04:29.098
You want me to prove I'm not Drill.

04:29.132 --> 04:30.115
Can you?

04:30.150 --> 04:31.717
Well, if I was Drill,

04:31.719 --> 04:34.319
wouldn't I want to trick you
into thinking I'm not?

04:36.389 --> 04:38.724
- So...
- [Sighs]

04:38.726 --> 04:40.893
no matter what I do...

04:42.812 --> 04:45.447
Besides... [Scoffs]

04:45.482 --> 04:46.999
why do I have to prove it?

04:47.033 --> 04:50.736
Shouldn't you have to prove I'm guilty?

04:52.772 --> 04:54.907
Why don't we try something?

04:54.941 --> 04:58.944
I'm gonna take your gloves off.

04:58.962 --> 05:03.832
- You want me to touch you?
- Like you did Cassandra, yes.

05:07.387 --> 05:09.254
<i>But...</i>

05:09.256 --> 05:11.173
Aren't you scared?

05:13.726 --> 05:15.177
I'm trying not to be.

05:46.042 --> 05:48.160
I don't want to do this.

05:55.301 --> 05:57.102
Okay.

05:59.472 --> 06:02.557
Okay. One more thing.

06:02.608 --> 06:04.476
[Sighs]

06:04.478 --> 06:06.811
Can you tell me what Orion is?

06:06.862 --> 06:09.397
I don't know...
you say you want to help me,

06:09.448 --> 06:10.565
- but you keep asking me questions.
- I do want to help you.

06:10.616 --> 06:11.733
I do want to help you, Minx.

06:11.784 --> 06:13.151
[Sighs] No, I don't believe you.

06:13.185 --> 06:14.319
Why would you say that?

06:14.321 --> 06:15.654
'Cause you don't like me.

06:15.705 --> 06:17.489
- No, that is... that's not true.
- You want me to be guilty.

06:17.491 --> 06:18.490
No.

06:18.524 --> 06:20.558
You want me to be Drill. [Scoffs]

06:20.593 --> 06:23.561
'Cause then you get everything...

06:23.596 --> 06:26.164
Don't you?

06:32.538 --> 06:37.342
All I want right now...

06:37.344 --> 06:39.511
is to find Drill.

06:39.513 --> 06:44.716
Do you really think
it's gonna be that easy?

07:14.121 --> 07:17.455
Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk
www.addic7ed.com

07:19.753 --> 07:21.710
So, Dr. Benavidez told you about Drill?

07:21.960 --> 07:23.293
Not exactly.

07:23.328 --> 07:25.963
See, she was frightened...
couldn't give me the full story.

07:25.997 --> 07:28.632
That's how it usually works
with whistle-blowers.

07:28.666 --> 07:30.000
They give you a bread crumb

07:30.002 --> 07:32.503
and hope you find the truth
and leave them out of it.

07:32.505 --> 07:34.638
- What's the bread crumb?
- Harbor Point.

07:34.672 --> 07:36.890
She told me to dig into the real story.

07:36.925 --> 07:38.575
That's when I learned about the meltdown,

07:38.610 --> 07:42.246
what happened afterwards,
and how Drill was responsible.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.931
So you know what Drill is.

07:43.982 --> 07:46.433
As far as I can tell,

07:46.484 --> 07:48.685
it's a secret government
nuclear-testing program.

07:48.687 --> 07:52.522
Now, whether Drill is
an acronym or a code name...

07:52.524 --> 07:53.824
I'm still working on that one.

07:53.858 --> 07:56.693
But that night, at Harbor Point,
something went wrong,

07:56.695 --> 07:59.196
and children in the surrounding
area started getting sick,

07:59.247 --> 08:00.414
including your son.

08:00.448 --> 08:02.082
So in order to contain the situation

08:02.116 --> 08:03.917
and keep the truth from getting out,

08:03.951 --> 08:06.420
our government issued a round-up.

08:06.454 --> 08:08.422
Now 87 children are locked up

08:08.456 --> 08:10.290
with no hope of ever getting out.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.378
I just need confirmation.

08:14.380 --> 08:16.179
I think we're done here.

08:18.549 --> 08:20.217
Just give me something.

08:20.268 --> 08:23.887
The public, they have a right
to know what's really happening.

08:26.390 --> 08:30.060
[Sighs]

08:30.062 --> 08:32.529
You think you're gonna be
able to hide this much longer?

08:32.563 --> 08:36.482
Other news outlets, they're
already chasing the story.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.485
Please.

08:38.535 --> 08:40.120
[Sighs]

08:40.154 --> 08:43.405
Wait.

08:45.159 --> 08:47.811
He's right.

08:47.845 --> 08:49.462
It's just a matter of time.

08:49.497 --> 08:52.415
How about we make a deal?

08:52.417 --> 08:54.417
You help me get what I want,

08:54.419 --> 08:56.803
I'll give you the
biggest story of your life.

08:59.507 --> 09:01.641
Henry.

09:03.778 --> 09:06.196
I need to ask you something.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.718
It's about Minx, isn't it?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.186
You were right there.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.773
You saw what happened.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.441
I don't want to get Minx in trouble.

09:18.476 --> 09:20.076
Neither do I.

09:20.111 --> 09:22.545
But right now, we really
need to know the truth.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.499
She...

09:28.385 --> 09:29.953
She grabbed Cassandra.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.672
And you're sure about this?

09:32.706 --> 09:38.711
'Cause, Henry, I need you to be
100% sure that it was Minx.

09:44.968 --> 09:48.321
Silas, walk us through that night...

09:48.355 --> 09:52.208
the night that you saw
Dr. Benavidez get killed.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.477
Can you do that?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.132
Okay.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.083
What were you doing out here
so late at night?

10:03.253 --> 10:05.805
I had to go to the bathroom...

10:10.394 --> 10:12.428
but I got lost.

10:16.099 --> 10:18.951
There was a light from one of the offices.

10:20.971 --> 10:23.856
She was talking on the phone... the doctor.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.008
What was she saying? Do you remember?

10:26.043 --> 10:29.395
I don't remember the words,
but she sounded worried.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.197
It doesn't make any sense.

10:31.248 --> 10:34.216
She saw something bad
on the computer, I think.

10:35.519 --> 10:36.686
Then what happened?

10:36.688 --> 10:39.288
There was a sound. It came from there.

10:39.290 --> 10:43.459
Someone was there, but I couldn't see who.

10:43.527 --> 10:48.697
So the doctor,
I think she saw who was there,

10:48.732 --> 10:51.650
who was at the door, and...

10:51.701 --> 10:53.953
Silas, it's okay.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.121
It's okay.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.557
There was this funny noise, like... A zap.

10:58.608 --> 11:01.043
No. No.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.661
- Stay away!
- [Electricity crackles]

11:02.712 --> 11:05.464
The doctor... she fell down.

11:05.515 --> 11:07.182
She stopped moving.

11:07.184 --> 11:08.984
And you saw who it was, didn't you?

11:10.287 --> 11:12.254
She didn't see me at first.

11:12.289 --> 11:13.806
I tried to get away.

11:15.392 --> 11:16.609
[Thud] Then she saw me.

11:18.161 --> 11:19.445
[Breathing shakily]

11:19.496 --> 11:21.780
She said she was going to kill my mom.

11:21.831 --> 11:24.283
[Crying]

11:24.334 --> 11:27.453
She said if I told anyone...

11:27.504 --> 11:29.455
- Is my mom okay?
- Yes.

11:29.506 --> 11:32.291
Yes.

11:32.342 --> 11:34.209
She's okay.

11:34.211 --> 11:38.714
I need to know if you're sure...

11:38.716 --> 11:40.799
It was Minx that you saw.

11:40.850 --> 11:44.887
It was her. I swear.

11:53.322 --> 11:54.472
We have something.

11:55.285 --> 11:56.452
We were able to recover

11:56.457 --> 11:58.975
partial fragments
of Dr. Benavidez's hard drive.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.860
Here's the activity log from that night.

12:00.895 --> 12:05.332
At 11:06 P.M., she made an
entry into a notes field.

12:05.383 --> 12:06.466
At the same time,

12:06.517 --> 12:08.435
she was talking to an unidentified number.

12:08.486 --> 12:11.588
- No trace yet of who she was talking to?
- Not yet, sir.

12:11.622 --> 12:14.507
But at 11:09 P.M.,
her call was disconnected.

12:14.558 --> 12:18.862
The next activity... 12:28 A.M.

12:18.896 --> 12:20.997
That's after her time of death.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.799
Someone accessed that same file,

12:22.833 --> 12:25.101
somehow bypassing her security password.

12:25.136 --> 12:27.070
They then erased
the last note that was made.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.455
Any way to recover the note?

12:28.506 --> 12:29.756
Unfortunately not.

12:29.807 --> 12:34.077
But I was able to determine
which file was modified.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.715
Millicent?

12:38.766 --> 12:41.384
That's Minx's real name.

12:47.041 --> 12:50.310
Drill was covering his tracks.

12:50.344 --> 12:52.295
The doctor must have found
some kind of evidence

12:52.329 --> 12:55.214
that proved Minx is Drill.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.636
That'll be all for now.

13:06.410 --> 13:10.646
I believe I have what I need now.

13:10.648 --> 13:14.584
But since Wes has asked for
your input, Agent Bennigan...

13:14.618 --> 13:16.586
What's your professional opinion?

13:19.406 --> 13:21.224
Wes...

13:21.258 --> 13:24.327
It isn't just the burn mark.

13:24.361 --> 13:27.680
Silas... he knew details
that he could have only known

13:27.731 --> 13:29.315
if he was actually there,
and you heard his voice...

13:29.349 --> 13:30.670
a child his age can't
fake that kind of fear.

13:30.695 --> 13:31.641
Okay, so he saw something...

13:31.668 --> 13:33.085
We both know that witnesses...

13:33.120 --> 13:33.887
and Minx's file, if something was erased...

13:33.912 --> 13:38.407
We don't know... We don't know
what was in that file, Claire.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.661
All I can do...

13:41.712 --> 13:45.598
is look at this like you and I
have been trained to do.

13:45.632 --> 13:46.766
I wish... I wish...

13:49.686 --> 13:51.202
more than anything that I could conclude

13:51.227 --> 13:52.755
- something else.
- Claire. Claire. Claire.

13:52.757 --> 13:55.558
Please.

13:59.112 --> 14:00.763
Please.

14:08.622 --> 14:10.055
I'm sorry.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.025
[Sniffles] Okay.

14:13.059 --> 14:14.310
- [Grunts]
- [Clang]

14:14.361 --> 14:16.295
[Breathing shakily]

14:20.250 --> 14:22.852
Thank you, Agent Bennigan.

14:32.662 --> 14:34.697
[Water running]

14:58.121 --> 15:01.056
[Metal clangs]

15:01.107 --> 15:04.726
- Jessup: What are you doing?
- Jessup, he's right.

15:04.777 --> 15:08.914
The truth is gonna come out...
maybe not today, but soon.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.399
Let's make this work for us.

15:10.433 --> 15:11.850
Us?

15:11.935 --> 15:13.268
And how exactly does that work?

15:13.270 --> 15:14.770
Reporters have to fact-check, right?

15:14.772 --> 15:16.104
Meaning?

15:16.139 --> 15:17.756
Meaning I tell him everything
that's really going on

15:17.790 --> 15:19.174
with the kids, with Drill.

15:19.208 --> 15:21.343
His first call's gonna be to
the White House

15:21.377 --> 15:22.644
for confirmation.

15:22.695 --> 15:24.363
After that...

15:24.414 --> 15:25.514
Pressure's on.

15:25.548 --> 15:26.915
They're gonna have to release the kids,

15:26.917 --> 15:28.800
or they're gonna have to deal
with the backlash of the public.

15:28.835 --> 15:29.851
You mean panic.

15:29.902 --> 15:31.853
'Cause that's what
we're talking about here.

15:31.855 --> 15:33.355
It's only a matter of time.

15:33.406 --> 15:35.290
Time is something that I do not have.

15:35.292 --> 15:37.759
I want my son home now.

15:44.467 --> 15:46.001
- I want those removed.
- I'm sorry, sir.

15:46.003 --> 15:47.803
I have my orders. This is ridiculous!
She is a child!

15:47.837 --> 15:48.854
Come on.

15:48.905 --> 15:50.021
Sir! Sir!

15:50.073 --> 15:51.239
Minx: No, stop!

15:51.274 --> 15:54.209
I'll have no choice but to escort you out.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.510
Do you understand?

15:55.545 --> 15:57.312
Yes.

15:57.346 --> 15:58.313
10 minutes.

15:58.364 --> 16:01.249
That's what you've been cleared for.

16:04.587 --> 16:05.754
Hey.

16:05.805 --> 16:07.455
Hey.

16:07.490 --> 16:09.191
You okay, sweetie?

16:09.242 --> 16:11.076
[Whimpering]

16:11.110 --> 16:12.410
You have to get me out, daddy.

16:12.461 --> 16:14.296
Honey, I just need
a little more time, okay?

16:14.298 --> 16:16.231
- How much time?
- All right?

16:17.984 --> 16:19.918
I know they're gonna do something to me.

16:19.952 --> 16:23.004
Sweetie, I will not let them hurt you.

16:23.039 --> 16:24.339
I promise, okay?

16:24.373 --> 16:26.641
All right?

16:29.278 --> 16:30.412
I'm scared.

16:30.479 --> 16:31.746
I know.

16:31.748 --> 16:36.267
But you and I... we just need
to be brave right now, okay?

16:39.038 --> 16:41.923
[Crying]

16:44.810 --> 16:46.978
Okay, baby. It's all right.

16:47.012 --> 16:47.996
[Smooches]

16:51.750 --> 16:52.750
Alright?

16:55.554 --> 16:57.805
Hey. I understand.

16:57.857 --> 17:01.693
It's okay.

17:01.744 --> 17:04.612
Hey.

17:04.614 --> 17:06.547
Do you remember, uh...

17:06.582 --> 17:09.601
You remember when... When you were little

17:09.635 --> 17:13.788
and we used to... We used to say that poem,

17:13.821 --> 17:16.991
the one that would make
our fears magically go away?

17:17.041 --> 17:18.459
You used to know it by heart.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.795
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
You remember?

17:20.846 --> 17:21.846
Huh?

17:23.365 --> 17:24.866
[Chuckles]

17:24.900 --> 17:27.919
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

17:27.970 --> 17:30.338
How I wonder what you are.

17:30.389 --> 17:32.390
All right?

17:32.424 --> 17:34.308
Up above the world so high.

17:34.310 --> 17:38.830
Like a diamond in the sky.

17:38.881 --> 17:42.717
When the blazing sun is gone,
when he nothing shines upon.

17:42.768 --> 17:44.719
Minx, say the words, honey.

17:44.770 --> 17:46.220
- No.
- Hey, I need you to...

17:46.271 --> 17:47.388
I don't want to do this.

17:47.422 --> 17:49.240
Okay, then you shine your little light

17:49.291 --> 17:50.791
twinkle, twinkle all the night.

17:50.842 --> 17:51.843
Okay?

17:51.877 --> 17:54.128
You're testing me.

17:54.179 --> 17:55.463
Baby, it's just...

17:55.465 --> 17:56.597
[Sniffles]

17:56.632 --> 17:58.282
I can't... I can't think of
the words right now.

17:58.317 --> 18:00.534
My brain's fuzzy.

18:07.175 --> 18:10.361
Daddy. Daddy, please.

18:10.395 --> 18:13.280
[Sighs]

18:13.315 --> 18:15.416
- It's okay.
- [Sobbing] Daddy, please.

18:15.467 --> 18:16.417
It's okay.

18:16.468 --> 18:18.052
No.

18:18.086 --> 18:20.938
It's okay.

18:25.744 --> 18:28.212
It's okay, sweetheart.

18:28.246 --> 18:29.880
You don't have to say the words.

18:29.931 --> 18:31.599
[Sniffles]

18:31.633 --> 18:34.602
You're my dad.
You're supposed to believe me.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.044
[Whimpering]

18:57.509 --> 19:00.144
[Breathing shakily]

19:13.742 --> 19:14.875
[Grunting]

19:21.766 --> 19:24.518
[Sobbing]

19:54.345 --> 19:56.229
Girl: Why didn't Minx tell us
she was Drill all along?

19:56.231 --> 19:58.331
- Boy: They've me these questions all day.
- Why can't I just go home?

19:58.365 --> 19:59.833
Girl: We shared all our secrets together.

19:59.835 --> 20:01.468
I don't know what to tell them.
Drill is just our friend.

20:01.470 --> 20:03.353
I don't know what I did wrong.

20:03.387 --> 20:05.905
[Indistinct conversations]

20:12.496 --> 20:14.047
Henry?

20:18.185 --> 20:20.119
Are you there?

20:27.002 --> 20:28.485
It's Minx. Can you hear me?

20:28.520 --> 20:29.553
Yeah.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.876
[Sighs]

20:35.927 --> 20:37.094
I need your help.

20:37.128 --> 20:40.297
You need to talk to your mom,
tell her I'm not Drill.

20:40.331 --> 20:41.598
Uh, I don't know.

20:41.633 --> 20:45.202
I swear, Henry, I'm not Drill.
You have to help me.

20:45.236 --> 20:47.004
Please.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.772
Do you know what they're gonna do to me?

20:50.975 --> 20:54.778
Aren't you my friend, Henry?

20:54.829 --> 20:56.079
[Breathing heavily]

20:56.081 --> 20:58.248
Henry, why aren't you answering me?

20:58.283 --> 21:00.684
They're gonna kill her, Claire.

21:00.735 --> 21:02.986
She's my daughter.
I cannot let that happen.

21:02.988 --> 21:03.954
Wes, that's not Minx.

21:04.005 --> 21:05.255
Even if you're right

21:05.257 --> 21:07.007
and Drill has taken possession of her,

21:07.058 --> 21:08.392
that doesn't mean she's gone.

21:08.426 --> 21:11.745
What if, somewhere inside her
body, my daughter's still alive?

21:11.796 --> 21:13.096
Thomas Harcourt said that when...

21:13.131 --> 21:14.631
Thomas was 8 years old when it happened.

21:14.633 --> 21:16.983
What if he was wrong?
And what if he <i>wasn't?</i>

21:17.035 --> 21:19.836
Wes, we already missed our
chance to end this once before.

21:19.871 --> 21:21.338
Yes, and my wife was killed,

21:21.340 --> 21:22.973
so I am well aware of
the consequences, Claire.

21:23.007 --> 21:23.974
[Sighs]

21:24.025 --> 21:27.077
Minx...

21:27.128 --> 21:28.545
Is all I have left.

21:28.579 --> 21:31.798
If I lose her...

21:31.849 --> 21:33.884
So I need you to look at me

21:33.886 --> 21:36.903
and tell me that
you are certain she has gone.

21:36.954 --> 21:38.705
That is not fair.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.841
Look at me in the eye
and tell me she's dead,

21:40.892 --> 21:43.360
that the promise that I made to her when
she was a little girl means nothing

21:43.362 --> 21:46.279
and that there is no hope
that I will ever get her back.

21:46.330 --> 21:48.165
And then...

21:48.199 --> 21:50.133
Then I will believe you.

21:54.539 --> 21:55.872
Haley: Sir, we have good news.

21:55.923 --> 22:00.310
We now know which of
the children has been possessed.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.195
Who?

22:02.246 --> 22:05.048
It's Wes Lawrence's daughter.

22:06.884 --> 22:09.235
I know. It's unfortunate.

22:09.270 --> 22:10.737
My daughter, she's...

22:10.788 --> 22:12.872
Perfectly fine.

22:12.923 --> 22:16.259
The other children,
they're... they're all safe.

22:16.261 --> 22:18.511
So we could release them, then.

22:18.562 --> 22:20.196
With all due respect, uh,

22:20.198 --> 22:23.900
we don't know how much influence
he still has over them.

22:23.934 --> 22:26.102
Right now, the most prudent
course of action

22:26.137 --> 22:27.654
is to keep them all locked up

22:27.688 --> 22:30.406
until we know for sure
Drill has been neutralized.

22:30.424 --> 22:32.876
Yes.

22:32.878 --> 22:34.377
[Inhales deeply]

22:34.379 --> 22:37.313
I know I made the wrong call, Haley.

22:37.315 --> 22:41.167
Excuse me?

22:41.202 --> 22:43.803
I shouldn't have let him go.

22:43.854 --> 22:47.290
I know that now.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.844
This time, we'll make the right decision.

22:51.896 --> 22:55.365
The questions is, how?

22:55.399 --> 22:57.700
I believe we actually have
the perfect weapon

22:57.735 --> 22:58.901
to accomplish our task.

22:58.936 --> 23:00.803
Sean: Three months ago,

23:00.805 --> 23:03.606
I was sent to the Arctic
to test an experimental weapon.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.744
It was an electron-pulse device
designed to emit

23:07.746 --> 23:10.797
an electrical charge equivalent
to 100 lightning strikes.

23:10.848 --> 23:14.367
Unfortunately...
Things didn't go as planned.

23:14.401 --> 23:17.854
We brought him to us.

23:17.888 --> 23:21.340
He saw the energy, and he came right at me.

23:21.391 --> 23:22.992
"He"?

23:23.026 --> 23:27.497
When I saw that blue light...

23:27.531 --> 23:30.833
That was when I knew
that something was here.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.469
"Something"?

23:33.504 --> 23:35.438
Something not human.

23:35.472 --> 23:37.406
Wes: I just need more time.

23:37.408 --> 23:38.958
Where are the guards?

23:38.992 --> 23:39.992
Oh, God.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.347
No!

23:44.398 --> 23:45.598
I'm sorry, Wes.

23:45.649 --> 23:47.566
- Where is she?!
- You have to believe me.

23:47.618 --> 23:49.619
I take no solace in what needs to be done.
Sir, you don't have to do this now.

23:49.621 --> 23:51.587
- I just need a few more days, so...
- To what?

23:51.622 --> 23:52.922
T... To remove Drill from her body.

23:52.924 --> 23:54.340
So now you're talking about exorcism?

23:54.424 --> 23:55.591
- Listen to yourself.
- Sir...

23:55.593 --> 23:57.259
No more negotiations, Wes. Please.

23:57.294 --> 23:59.061
We're going to end this today.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.446
No, no. I'm sorry, sir.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.947
- It's best if you weren't here for this.
- Sir, sir.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.199
- Please, you can't... you can't do this.
- Please, escort them out.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.200
You can't do this.
She is an 8-year-old child!

24:04.234 --> 24:06.736
Mr. Secretary, please, give us...

24:06.770 --> 24:08.387
Damn it!

24:08.422 --> 24:11.857
Talking about using this thing on a child?

24:11.892 --> 24:15.444
Haley: It's not a child, sir.
It's an alien threat.

24:15.446 --> 24:17.613
[Sighs deeply]

24:22.636 --> 24:26.455
Do it. Just get it over with.

24:26.489 --> 24:27.973
I'm not leaving here!

24:31.945 --> 24:33.112
Get off me!

24:35.532 --> 24:37.399
- Wes. Wes, Wes, Wes, Wes.
- [Guns cock]

24:37.401 --> 24:38.484
[Panting]

24:38.535 --> 24:40.736
I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry.

24:40.787 --> 24:42.488
There has to be another way, Claire.

24:42.539 --> 24:44.156
There has to be another way.

24:44.207 --> 24:45.824
[Vehicles approaching]

24:55.251 --> 24:57.920
What is that?

24:57.971 --> 25:00.222
That's how they're gonna do it.

25:02.759 --> 25:05.978
That's how they're gonna kill Minx.

25:06.012 --> 25:08.180
[Panting]

25:15.327 --> 25:16.695
We have to do whatever it takes.

25:16.708 --> 25:17.741
We have to save her.

25:17.793 --> 25:20.177
Sean: What happens
if the president says no?

25:20.212 --> 25:21.345
That's not an option.

25:21.347 --> 25:24.782
- This isn't on you, Claire.
- Isn't it?

25:25.424 --> 25:26.890
You did what you had to do,

25:26.892 --> 25:28.775
just like I did.

25:28.826 --> 25:29.910
What are you talking about?

25:33.197 --> 25:35.632
I just talked to a reporter,
gave him the whole story.

25:35.726 --> 25:37.276
Sean, why would you do that?

25:37.327 --> 25:39.028
Because this exposes everything.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.030
They'll be forced to let our kids go.

25:41.064 --> 25:44.233
That's the only way we get Henry back home.

25:44.235 --> 25:46.368
I have to go.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.837
I'll call you as soon as I can.

25:47.839 --> 25:50.556
I just got off with the press secretary.

25:50.607 --> 25:52.875
Now it's their move.

25:52.909 --> 25:54.376
Wes: My contact at the White House,

25:54.411 --> 25:55.461
she's not making any promises,

25:55.512 --> 25:56.712
but she's trying to get us a meeting.

25:56.714 --> 25:58.380
Okay. Let's go.

26:03.053 --> 26:05.688
Mr. President, I'm sorry
for the interruption.

26:05.739 --> 26:07.523
Excuse me, gentlemen.

26:11.461 --> 26:14.980
Uh... We got a call from
the <i>Baltimore Observer.</i>

26:15.031 --> 26:17.299
They, uh...

26:17.334 --> 26:18.500
They know about Drill.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.836
How long do we have?

26:20.870 --> 26:22.321
Well, they say about two hours,

26:22.372 --> 26:24.373
but I'm confident I can get
them to hold the story...

26:24.407 --> 26:25.474
That won't be necessary.

26:25.508 --> 26:27.076
Excuse me?

26:27.110 --> 26:29.278
It'll all be over in about two hours.

26:29.312 --> 26:32.181
I want to go live before the story breaks.

26:32.215 --> 26:35.617
Sir, I have to advise against...

26:35.652 --> 26:38.871
Do you understand the kind of
panic that this could cause?

26:38.905 --> 26:41.039
No more than if the leader of this nation

26:41.090 --> 26:44.476
is caught lying to the
very people who elected him.

26:44.511 --> 26:47.996
No more hiding. No more secrets.

26:48.031 --> 26:49.748
This is what must be done.

26:49.799 --> 26:53.302
Yes, sir.

26:53.304 --> 26:57.289
Oh, and, Alan, one more thing.

26:57.323 --> 26:59.508
Get those children home.

26:59.542 --> 27:01.109
I want my daughter back.

27:01.144 --> 27:03.478
Yes, sir.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.565
[Indistinct talking]

27:08.651 --> 27:09.968
Where are they taking us?

27:10.003 --> 27:11.920
How should I know?

27:52.144 --> 27:53.728
[Engines shut off]

28:02.238 --> 28:04.906
Man: <i>In a few minutes, we're gonna
go live to the White House,</i>

28:04.908 --> 28:06.174
<i>where President Winters has called</i>

28:06.208 --> 28:08.543
<i>a last-minute press conference.</i>

28:13.816 --> 28:15.083
Wes: Please. We don't have much time.

28:15.117 --> 28:16.284
- Okay, I just... I need...
- Wes, I'm...

28:16.335 --> 28:17.836
- I need five minutes with him.
- Wes, I'm trying,

28:17.870 --> 28:19.287
- but now this press conference has come up.
- look, you just...

28:19.338 --> 28:20.538
you just tell him that... that
there's an alternative, okay?

28:20.589 --> 28:21.556
We don't have to pull
the trigger right now.

28:21.590 --> 28:22.557
He'll know what I'm talking about.

28:22.559 --> 28:24.192
- Okay. I'm trying.
- Please.

28:24.226 --> 28:25.410
You don't understand how important this is.
We don't have time.

28:25.444 --> 28:28.496
- Okay.
- Please.

28:30.299 --> 28:32.133
[Computer beeping]

28:35.070 --> 28:38.790
[Sighs] I can't tell you
what a relief that is.

28:38.841 --> 28:40.625
I'll be right there. Thank you.

28:40.676 --> 28:41.926
[Beeps]

28:41.961 --> 28:43.778
They're letting the kids out.

28:43.812 --> 28:46.281
So it worked.
Looks like Oberon came through.

28:46.315 --> 28:48.149
What's Oberon?

28:48.200 --> 28:50.418
Secret service code name for the president.

28:50.452 --> 28:51.953
Each family member of the family has one.

28:51.987 --> 28:53.388
They all start with the same letter...

28:53.422 --> 28:57.191
first lady, she's Olympia.

28:57.193 --> 29:00.528
And what about the daughter?

29:00.546 --> 29:02.747
Uh, don't know that one
off the top of my head.

29:02.798 --> 29:03.798

Sean, I can't... I can't talk right now.

29:10.273 --> 29:12.073
Claire, it's Cassandra. She's Drill.

29:12.107 --> 29:14.575
What?

29:14.577 --> 29:17.044
Orion... it's Cassandra's
secret service code name.

29:17.079 --> 29:18.796
What?

29:18.847 --> 29:21.265
You were right.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.050
It isn't Minx.

29:23.101 --> 29:25.720
Copy that. Olympia and Orion on the move.

29:43.121 --> 29:45.226
He's in the White House.

29:48.029 --> 29:48.995
Drill framed Minx.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.463
So Cassandra burned herself.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.048
- Henry?! She must have.
- Minx?

29:52.099 --> 29:53.266
With the evacuation of the children,

29:53.301 --> 29:54.618
there was so much chaos that we...

29:54.652 --> 29:56.119
we weren't looking at her.
We were looking at Minx.

29:58.873 --> 30:01.992
What about Silas? He said he saw Minx.

30:02.026 --> 30:04.611
He was telling the truth about
everything but who he saw.

30:04.613 --> 30:06.212
It was Cassandra who caught him.

30:06.214 --> 30:09.015
She's the one
who threatened to hurt his mom.

30:09.050 --> 30:10.483
What about Maria's computer file?

30:10.485 --> 30:12.419
Cassandra knew that
we'd be able to retrieve it,

30:12.470 --> 30:15.054
so she doctored Minx's file.

30:15.056 --> 30:17.157
Oh, Claire, I...

30:17.191 --> 30:18.708

31:10.676 --> 31:12.508
but Secretary Frommer is not available.

31:12.542 --> 31:14.310
Tell him it's not Minx. It's Cassandra.

31:14.312 --> 31:15.661

always tell me when I'm scared?

32:17.040 --> 32:19.591
"Be brave."

I will try to keep that in mind.

32:25.699 --> 32:26.849
The president, he's the target?

32:26.883 --> 32:28.217
Claire: But it doesn't make any sense.

32:28.268 --> 32:29.902
If Drill wanted to kill the president,

32:29.936 --> 32:32.104
he could've possessed
Cassandra a long time ago.

32:32.155 --> 32:33.589
Why wait this long?

32:36.309 --> 32:39.695

He's not after the president.

33:32.265 --> 33:37.519
That's what my daughter said
to me before I walked in here.

33:37.553 --> 33:40.989
Such simple words from a child,

33:41.023 --> 33:43.925

an enemy unlike any which
