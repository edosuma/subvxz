WEBVTT

00:24.558 --> 00:28.262
-Ooh!
-Yeah, baby!

00:28.296 --> 00:29.397
-We...

00:29.430 --> 00:30.798
-Just...
-Had...

00:30.831 --> 00:31.832
-The...
-Best...

00:31.865 --> 00:33.134
-Idea...
-Ever!

00:33.167 --> 00:34.168
-And...
-It's...

00:34.202 --> 00:35.269
-Not...
-Just...

00:35.303 --> 00:36.370
-Taking...
-Turns...

00:36.404 --> 00:37.405
-Saying...
-Each...

00:37.438 --> 00:38.472
-Word...
-In...

00:38.506 --> 00:40.174
-A...
-Sentence.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.743
What could be a better idea
than the alternating of words?

00:42.776 --> 00:44.412
Please don't
encourage them, Star.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.479
-We...
-Had...

00:45.513 --> 00:46.547
-The...
-Great...

00:46.580 --> 00:47.748
-Idea...
-To...

00:47.781 --> 00:48.716
Just say it!

00:48.749 --> 00:50.318
We want to make yearbooks
for the Titans.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.286
Of what year is this book?

00:52.320 --> 00:54.388
The year is this year, Star.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.756
Hmm...

00:59.860 --> 01:00.961
This year!

01:00.994 --> 01:02.796
We're going to finally
commemorate all the highlights

01:02.830 --> 01:05.099
of the last year
in the form of pictures,

01:05.133 --> 01:06.834
in the form of a book!

01:06.867 --> 01:07.735
Absolutely not!

01:07.768 --> 01:09.603
Yearbooks are only
popularity contests

01:09.637 --> 01:11.405
that leave people
with hurt feelings.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.807
Tell them
this is a bad idea, Robin.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.777
Popularity contest.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.779
Popularity contest.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.161
May I sign the yearbook?

01:33.194 --> 01:36.530
Sure, I still have some space
in the corner of this page.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.466
I want to sign it too,
Your Majesty.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.867
Keep in touch with me, bro!

01:39.900 --> 01:42.903
I want you to have
a good summer.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.738
Whoa! Whoa! One at a time.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.440
One at a time.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.510
A yearbook is a great idea!

01:49.543 --> 01:50.611
My notable achievements

01:50.644 --> 01:52.346
will finally
be recognized in print.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.748
Like "Best hair"
and "Class clown".

01:54.782 --> 01:57.418
Class clown!
You're not funny.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.653
Only the yearbook
can say for sure.

01:59.687 --> 02:03.157
Finally, I can prove
I'm socially superior
to all of you!

02:03.191 --> 02:04.592
Indeed.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.461
What is the first step
in the making of the yearbook?

02:07.495 --> 02:09.363
Picture day, girl!

02:09.397 --> 02:10.664
-Ah!
-Ooh.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.504
So good! Silkie,
you are working it, buddy.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.906
The camera
is in love with you.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.408
Next!

02:27.415 --> 02:28.782
CYBORG: Next!

02:32.420 --> 02:33.921
Smile, tiger.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.924
-Next!
-Let's get this over with.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.792
How about we get a shot
with your hood off,

02:38.826 --> 02:41.262
so we get a picture
of your smiling face?

02:41.295 --> 02:44.365
-No.
-I know there's a pretty girl
under there.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.866
-Just take it.
-Oh, come on.

02:45.899 --> 02:46.967
Don't be shy.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.369
You're so pretty.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.271
Show the world
how beautiful you...

02:53.474 --> 02:54.708
Next.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.744
Handsome devil.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.448
Next!

03:00.481 --> 03:02.550
I have to nail this photo.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.285
Ha!
Whoo!

03:04.318 --> 03:06.687
Cha-cha!
Hi-yaw! Ha.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.422
Dude, how about a smile?

03:08.456 --> 03:09.990
Sorry.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.293
Cool dudes don't smile.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.561
Oh, come on, Rob,

03:13.594 --> 03:15.329
give us
a little smile for the birdie.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.697
-Oh, you...

03:16.730 --> 03:18.566
You think a dog toy
is going to make me smile?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.734
CYBORG: We're two birds
of a feather,
aren't we, Robin?

03:20.768 --> 03:23.003
I want to be your friend.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.440
He's my friend.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.276
-Got it!
No!

03:31.779 --> 03:33.981
Well, picture day
was a disaster.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.450
I told you
yearbooks were a bad idea.

03:36.484 --> 03:37.851
It's okay.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.587
It was only one picture
out of possible thousands.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.855
There can be more
of the pictures
in the yearbook?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.458
Of course,
like pictures of all my clubs.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.526
Yeah!

03:45.559 --> 03:46.927
You're not in any clubs.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.797
I'm in a lot of clubs.
I'm just the only member.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.832
There has to be
two people in a club,

03:51.865 --> 03:54.302
otherwise it's just
a sad and lonely little man
hanging out with himself.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.338
Yeah, like we're
in the Pancake
Appreciation Society.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.473
* Silver dollar short stacks

03:59.507 --> 04:01.342
* Syrup on my flapjacks

04:01.375 --> 04:02.643
* Pancakes! Pancakes!

04:02.676 --> 04:04.778
* We appreciate pancakes!

04:05.613 --> 04:07.548
Pancake Club!

04:07.581 --> 04:08.816
That's not a real club.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.485
It's real 'cause I like
pancakes for real, mama.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.853
All it takes is two members.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.290
Ooh, then let us all
form the clubs.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.848
Sorry, none of your clubs
worked out, dude.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.683
That's funny
that you mentioned that.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.084
I just formed a new club.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.586
Anyone else want to join

04:45.619 --> 04:46.787
the "People Who Talk to
Themselves" club?

04:46.820 --> 04:47.988
I do, Robin.

04:48.021 --> 04:48.722
That's two members.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.558
Uh, me too.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.360
Whoa! This club
is growing so fast!

04:52.393 --> 04:54.762
It's nice
to meet so many fellow voices.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.864
I was worried about this.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.400
His need to be featured
prominently in the yearbook
is driving him cuckoo bird.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.634
Don't worry about me, Raven.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.702
I'll be featured.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.504
I'm a lock
for the yearbook awards.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.373
"Best hair."
"Tightest pants."

05:05.406 --> 05:08.409
Don't forget the "Most Voices
in His Head" award.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.677
Why, thank you, voice.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.380
And of course,
"Most Likely to Succeed".

05:12.413 --> 05:14.882
What exactly makes you
more likely to succeed
than us?

05:14.915 --> 05:18.419
Just watch me!

05:18.452 --> 05:20.421
Come on, come on, come on.
Think, Robin, think.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.356
How can I be a success?

05:22.390 --> 05:24.958
I just have to start
a business providing
something everyone needs.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.093
But what?

06:16.710 --> 06:17.978
Ha, ha!

06:18.011 --> 06:20.581
I made a multimillion dollar
boot industry.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.484
Time to give me that "Most
Likely to Succeed" award.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.752
Sorry, Robin, we can't.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.655
But my boot factory
is a huge success.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.956
They are super comfortable.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.158
See!

06:31.191 --> 06:33.627
Well, how can you be
the most likely to succeed

06:33.661 --> 06:35.162
when you've already succeeded.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.098
It does defeat
the whole point of the award.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.578
Hey!

06:50.611 --> 06:51.779
Everyone!

06:51.812 --> 06:53.213
-Yearbooks...
-Are...

06:53.246 --> 06:54.548
-In!
-Check...

06:54.582 --> 06:55.683
-Them...
-Out!

06:55.716 --> 06:57.050
Just give me the book!

06:57.084 --> 06:59.487
Oh, you beautiful
leathery little book.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.456
You're finally going
to validate me as the most
popular Teen Titan.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.124
Oh, yeah! Check it out!

07:04.157 --> 07:06.594
I got
Most Likely to Have Worms!

07:07.961 --> 07:09.863
Who is this dashing gentleman
on pages 7, 18,

07:09.897 --> 07:15.703
24, 109, 157, 187, 191, 211,
215 through 236 and 254?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.771
Oh, it's me!

07:17.805 --> 07:19.873
I'm on nearly every page!

07:19.907 --> 07:21.942
Oh, look, there I am. Cool.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.478
Quiet!

07:24.512 --> 07:26.780
I need silence while
I check out all my pictures.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.882
Not me, not me,
not me, not me, ha!

07:28.916 --> 07:30.684
Oh, that's a cactus.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.786
Not me, not me.
Hey, there I am.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.756
Ooh, that's not
a very good picture.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.091
Not me, not me, not me,
not me, not me, not me,

07:38.125 --> 07:39.793
not me, not me,
not me, not me.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.261
What's happening to him?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.663
Yearbook madness.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.832
Not me, not me,
not me, not me...

07:44.865 --> 07:47.868
One page! I'm on one page!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.205
That's okay.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.174
It's not like
the true test of popularity is

07:54.207 --> 07:56.009
how many times you show up
in the yearbook,

07:56.043 --> 07:58.178
it's how many signatures
you get in your yearbook.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.212
Sign my yearbook!

07:59.246 --> 08:02.082
Sign it!

08:02.115 --> 08:05.719
Oh, I see, you're afraid
I'm going to be most popular.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.822
Well, I don't need
your signatures,

08:08.856 --> 08:10.190
because I'm going
to get the most signatures

08:10.223 --> 08:13.193
of anyone in any yearbook,
of all time!

08:22.670 --> 08:26.039
-Raven, will you sign
my book of the year?
-Sure.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.642
Sign my yearbook!

08:28.676 --> 08:30.143
Sign my yearbook!

08:32.012 --> 08:33.747
Sign my yearbook!

08:38.351 --> 08:40.287
Sign my yearbook!

08:40.320 --> 08:41.922
Sign it!

08:43.123 --> 08:43.991
Sign it!

08:44.024 --> 08:45.559
Sign it! Sign it!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.763
Sign my yearbook!

08:49.797 --> 08:51.865
Ha, ha!
I have more signatures

08:51.899 --> 08:53.967
in my yearbook
than anyone else.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.036
* I am the best

08:56.069 --> 08:58.071
Are those...signatures?

08:58.105 --> 09:00.741
Green Lantern, Aqua Man,
Haunted Tank,

09:00.774 --> 09:03.911
Aliens Rule, Superman!
Where did these come from?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.312
The heroes heard
about our yearbook

09:05.345 --> 09:08.582
and wanted to sign
the adorable messages.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.785
And you didn't have to scream
or beat them to get them
to do it?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.954
No, bro.
They just like us.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.889
Huh! Must be nice.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.759
Well, I can still get
more signatures!

09:18.792 --> 09:20.694
Great job, Robin.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.095
Oh, thank you, Robin.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.364
No, Robin,
you're clearly the best.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.799
See you next year.

09:25.833 --> 09:29.036
Good luck. KIT.
To Robin, a true BFF.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.839
Too good to be forgotten!

09:31.872 --> 09:34.207
It's not
a popularity contest, Robin.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.644
Yes, it is!
And I'm going to win it.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.978
I have to be in the yearbook.

09:38.011 --> 09:42.015
You do have the one
awkward picture, Robin.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.853
No, I mean, I have to be
in the yearbook, literally!

09:45.886 --> 09:47.721
Raven, magic me in there, now!

09:47.755 --> 09:49.189
No way.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.925
How about you just calm down,
take some deep breaths?

09:51.959 --> 09:54.928
Sorry. I got
a little worked up.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.964
This is supposed
to be fun, right?

09:56.997 --> 09:58.732
Can I sign
your yearbook, Raven?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.133
Sure, why not?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.836
Will you read
what I wrote you?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.972
Of course.
Azarath Metrion Zinthos.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.274
Wow! I'm dumb.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.781
We're the best bros ever!

10:13.814 --> 10:17.050
Pancakes!
Keep in touch.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.186
"Most Likely to Get Married."

10:21.822 --> 10:23.857
Checkmate.
Chess Club rules!

10:23.891 --> 10:25.693
Woo

10:25.726 --> 10:26.794
Woo-hoo-hoo!

10:26.827 --> 10:28.095
Can we save him?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.798
Yeah, but do we
really want to?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.100
I win yearbook!

10:33.133 --> 10:35.703
Yes, yes, yes!
