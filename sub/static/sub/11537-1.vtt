You could have broke my hands.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.734
We were discussing marriage.

45:37.818 --> 45:41.988
To my mind, marriage
is no way of life for the weak,

45:42.072 --> 45:45.992

or the insecure.

What's the matter, Weston?
These damned fool Americans.

45:51.749 --> 45:54.667
They bog up everything
they're connected with.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.669
What a shower.

I'll never forgive
the president
for not coming...

45:58.756 --> 46:00.840
to dear old Churchill's funeral‒

46:00.924 --> 46:02.842
or at least sending
the vice president.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.511
Rotten bad manners.
It was very naughty.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.513
I quite agree.

46:07.598 --> 46:10.683
A typically
stupid, appalling
and unnecessary mistake.

Mr. Weston.

What's going on
in this classroom
of yours, old chum?

46:41.131 --> 46:45.051
Suburban formality?
It's a bit foreign in this
neck of the woods, isn't it?

46:45.135 --> 46:49.305
Some sort of experiment
in culture for the masses?

46:49.389 --> 46:51.390
It's an elementary
experiment in courtesy.

46:51.475 --> 46:55.061
And do we ignorant critters
have to follow suit?

46:55.145 --> 46:58.272
Please yourself.
Well, thank goodness for that.

Do you object to being
taught manners by one
of the boys, Mr. Weston?

47:01.527 --> 47:03.945
I don't expect to be taught manners
by those morons.

it doesn't matter
who teaches us, does it?

Your museum visit

if anything goes wrong,

Where's Jackson?
We don't know, sir.

Old Tich wouldn't miss
nothing like this unless
he was sick or something.

Can you wait a jiffy, please?

48:42.794 --> 48:45.379
Sure. How long will it take?

I mean, you're not.
It's kind of scary, but nice.

58:10.153 --> 58:12.279
You know what I mean,
don't you?

58:13.990 --> 58:16.867
Well, I‒ I don't know how
to answer you, except to say...

58:16.951 --> 58:20.204
that I teach you truths‒
my truths.

58:20.288 --> 58:23.582
Yeah, it is kind of scary,
dealing with the truth.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.919
Scary and dangerous.

58:29.172 --> 58:32.424
Now, have you ever
had a salad with, uh,

58:32.509 --> 58:35.427
with almonds and grapes
and tomatoes...

58:35.512 --> 58:37.429
and lettuce
and pineapple?

58:37.514 --> 58:40.599
[Students Clamoring,
Chattering]

58:40.683 --> 58:42.601
She's obviously
in love with you, Mark.

58:42.685 --> 58:46.271
[Laughs]
Oh, you shouldn't
be so surprised.

58:46.356 --> 58:49.107
We have a lot
of marvelous schools now
in the East End.

58:49.192 --> 58:52.110
It's still difficult
to get quality teachers.

58:52.195 --> 58:55.113
Take us‒
the bottom of the pile.

58:55.198 --> 58:58.450
Goodness knows we've
had a scruffy lot here.

58:58.535 --> 59:01.620
Then along comes
Mr. Mark Thackeray...

59:01.704 --> 59:05.123
big, broad, handsome,
clean, intelligent,

59:05.208 --> 59:08.794
looking like he stepped
out of a bandbox.

59:08.878 --> 59:10.963
What do you expect?

59:11.047 --> 59:12.965
What do I do?

59:13.049 --> 59:16.802
Nothing.
Just be patient.

59:16.886 --> 59:18.428
Thanks.

59:19.889 --> 59:24.142
Pamela's just finding out
she's a grown woman.

59:24.227 --> 59:28.814
You're probably
the only real man
she's ever met in her life.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.983
Don't spend too much time
alone with her.

59:33.236 --> 59:35.153
Why didn't you ask Gillian?

59:37.907 --> 59:40.659
Oh, I thought you'd be wiser.

59:40.743 --> 59:43.161
[Sighs]

59:43.246 --> 59:45.163
Well, thanks.

59:48.710 --> 59:50.627
[Door Closes]

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.529
Well, hello, sir.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.531
We can't have you
queuing up.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.534
It's sir.
He teaches our Moira
up at North Quay.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.037
He's only got an hour
for his lunch,
that's all he's got.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.122
Now, what'll it be, sir?
Half a dozen oranges.

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.875
Oh, you'll like them.
They're lovely and juicy.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.753
Here you are, guv.
Penny's wedding cake.

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.464
Jeanie's elder sister.
She went and got
married,

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:38.216
so we thought we'd give you
a bit of cake for luck.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:42.220
Jeanie Clark.
Oh! Yes. Miss Clark.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.390
That was a lovely museum
outing they went on.
We'll have to do it again.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.809
The Museum? Oh, well,

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.145
we're trying to arrange
one a week.

01:00:50.229 --> 01:00:52.230
Oh, that'll be lovely,
won't it, Horace?

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:55.984
The more education
they learns, the better.
That's what I always say.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:59.613
It's a proper bleeder, you know,
what with the bomb and all.

01:00:59.697 --> 01:01:02.824
'Tain't the bombs.
It's them bleedin'
foreigners, them Yanks.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.578
Shut your gob.
My Gert's married to a Yank.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.622
And a proper
nice gent he is, and all.

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:10.832
I'll thank you to keep
your opinions to yourself.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.795
God Al-bloody-mighty.
Getting technical, eh?

01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:17.255
Listen, first cast the mote
out of your own bleedin' eye...

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.257
before you cast the bomb
out of mine.
Aw, shut up.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.259
He's a proper faggot.
Here you are.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.261
You'll like them, sir.
Thank you.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.597
Thank you.
Who's next?
Come on, girls.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.599
Speak up.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.105
Gillian?
Uh-huh?

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:37.109
I was wondering if you
would also give the girls
some lessons in makeup.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:42.614
I think quite a few
of them would be, uh,

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.701
very pretty
if they knew how to do it.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.744
Well, certainly.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.794
You really are
getting involved
with your children,

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:58.088
aren't you?
No, I'm just trying to help.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:00.048
That's the job, isn't it?

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:02.134
You want some of this?
No, thanks.

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:04.970
Is that all you're
having for lunch?
Yep.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:10.559
You on a diet?
No. I'll tell you‒
I'm a weak man.

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:12.811
At the moment, a little skint.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.813
When I eat,
[Slurps]
do I love to eat.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:18.483
[Laughs]
And I love wine,
but I just can't have a glass.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.569
I want to drink
the whole bottle.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.405
So I avoid wine
and pastrami sandwiches...

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.490
and baked potatoes...

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.161
with butter and bacon...

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.872
and strawberry shortcake
and cheesecake.

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:33.874
[Laughing]

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.421
But I like to eat light,
uh, for lunch.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.634
How is it
with the Dare girl?

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.432
No problems.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:55.103
Are you going
to stay on here, Mark?
Until I get sorted out.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.147
No luck with the job?

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:59.191
But I'm plugging away.

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:04.905
Remember a few weeks ago,
when you thought you'd
lost the battle?

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:10.660
I thought you had too.
There's a good angel
looking after me somewhere.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.875
Come on.
Sort yourselves out.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.879
Go on. Hurry up.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.883
All right, go.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.052
Come on, Denham.
Hurry it up.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.059
Land on your toes.
Do it again. Next.

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:37.854
Next!

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:43.568
Next! Buckley!

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:45.570
Come on, boy.
I'm not a boy.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.405
I'm a man, and I don't want
to do it, sir.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.033
- It's too high.
- You're a boy,
and you're a fat boy too.

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:52.577
Come on. I'm waiting.
Get some of that jelly off of you.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.788
Fats can't do it.
It's too high for him.

01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:56.790
'Course he can't do it.

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.336
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it, boy.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.630
I'm not a boy.
Shut up!

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.802
Buckley, do as you're told.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.639
Come on.

01:04:21.774 --> 01:04:24.109

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.660
Move out of the way, boy!
Shut up!

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:36.997
[Buckley Moaning]
Is he all right, Bert?

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:39.249
[Moaning]
I don't know.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:47.340
You bloody bastard.

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.885
Put that down, Potter!
You knew Fats
couldn't do that.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:51.887
You've always
had it in for him.

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:53.889
Potter, put that down.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.854
Quick, sir!
They're fighting
in the gym, sir!

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:05.483
Go on, Potts!

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.530
- For the last time, put it down!
- That weren't no accident!

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:12.532
Potter!

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.661
I'll take that.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.668
Go and help Buckley.
Go on.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.842
Potts should have done
the bastard
like he did Fats.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.191
You all right, boy?
Yes, thank you, sir.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.193
Me stomach doesn't
half hurt though.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:51.029
Jackson, Ingham,
help him up to Mrs. Evans.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.453
All right.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:00.538
What happened?

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:04.084
[Sighs]
Hmm?

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.846
Buckley's all right.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.225
More frightened
than anything else.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.562
Why'd you make him
do that jump?

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.565
He just stood there
and refused to obey.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:32.237
When he jumped,
well, he sent the buck flying
and I couldn't catch him.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.239
Oh.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:37.575
Thanks for helping me out.
That Potter went berserk.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.579
[Sighs]

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.749
I understand
that Buckley is a...

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.751
pet whipping boy of yours.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.753
Is that right?

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:52.757
I'd better report it to the head.
There's gonna be the devil to pay.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:07.981
[Chattering]

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:27.167
Potter? I can't think of anything
that could excuse your behavior.

01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:30.295
But it was him, sir!
He made Fats do it!

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:34.007
Fats said he couldn't do it!
The bloody bully has always
had it in for him!

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:36.801
I'm not concerned with
Mr. Bell's behavior, but yours.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.554
Suppose instead of a piece
of wood, a gun or a knife
had been handy, eh?

01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:42.307
What then?
Potter was narked.
We was all narked.

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.434
That bleeder was in the wrong,
and you bloody well know it.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:47.312
You're missing the point, Denham.
You all are.

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.731
In a few weeks you will
be going out into the world.

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:52.400
Are you going to use
a weapon every time
someone makes you angry?

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.820
You're supposed to be learning
self-discipline here.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.865
Potter, you owe Mr. Bell
an apology.

01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:01.659
Huh?
No!
[All Shouting]

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:05.830
Why should he apologize?
Just 'cause Bell's
a bleedin' teacher, eh?

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.999
You'd better
answer that, Potter.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.543
Do you think you behaved
like a‒ like an adult?

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.765
How about Bell apologizing
to Buckley, eh?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.812
My business is with you,
not Mr. Bell.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:30.772
It's easy for you
to talk.

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:33.274
No one pushes you around.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.693
Well, Potter?

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:38.404
Are you a man or a hoodlum?

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.368
Do it, Potts.
Do it?
Denham!

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.371
[All Talking]

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.372
Bell will put you up
before the law
if you don't, won't he?

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.376
And you've got to have
recommends for a job,
ain't you?

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.627
He's got to sign one,
hasn't he?

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:57.549
This has nothing to do
with what I sign or won't sign.

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.884
There's never been
a teacher you could trust.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.804
We're only safe together...
against them.
Like it's always been.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:06.224
But sir's different!
If he says Potts is‒
That he is.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.017
And he's wrong now.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.104
You all know Bell's been
after old Fats for years.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.736
Go on, Potts.

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:31.249
If you apologize
because you're afraid,

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:34.419
then you're a child, not a man.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:42.260
[Door Closes]

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:48.515
When I leave, I've me own bearer,
so you can't touch me,

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.560
letters or no letters.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.791
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:17.962
But it's me mum, sir.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.633
She's dead.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.637
I've been helping
me dad with her things.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.810
[Voice Breaking]
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't know where to go, sir.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.146
It's all right.
[Sobbing]

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:37.857
Ingham, take over the class.

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.006
I understand that
the passing out class...

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:06.344
holds some kind
of a celebration
at the end of term.

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:08.346
What happens?

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.517
Hmm?

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.270
Hmm?
We dance,

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.855
sir.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.568
Did you apologize because
of what Denham said?

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.617
I believe one should fight
for what one believes,

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:33.496
provided one
is absolutely sure...
