with your dad,

10:15.657 --> 10:18.524
by the time we get home,
he’s gonna be wound up tighter
than an eight-day clock.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.326
I know, honey. But— [ Sighs]
What am I supposed to tell him?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.029
Tell him— Tell him—

10:24.124 --> 10:26.615
Tell him that we get points
against us at the day care...

10:26.710 --> 10:28.746
whenever we change Michael’s
schedule at the last minute.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.421
And if we get any more,
we could lose his spot.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.250
Wow. That is good.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.460
Are you that good
when you lie to me?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.546
How would I know?
I’ve never tried.

Smart boy.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.936

10:49.733 --> 10:53.225
-I don’t get it.
Why would someone kill Scottie?
-We|l, we’re workin’ on that.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.356
Any idea why your brother
was in Virginia?

10:55.447 --> 10:58.530
Yeah, sure. He only spent part
of his time in New Jersey.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.450
The rest of the time he was out
following tornadoes.

11:01.537 --> 11:03.903
- He was a storm chaser.
- Yeah.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.488
He’s a real weather geek.
He was also good.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.119
He was, like,
“The Storm Whisperer.”

11:08.210 --> 11:12.044
I mean, h-h-he had this way
ofjust getting inside a—
a tornado’s brain.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.667
Meaning you don’t think
he would do anything stupid
on purpose?

11:14.758 --> 11:18.342
Oh, no. No way.
And besides, if he ever was
to get himself in trouble,

11:18.428 --> 11:21.261
that mini-moho could
probably survive an H-bomb.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.715
- Mini-moho?
- Yeah, his— his motor home.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.971
It wasn’t with him?

11:27.062 --> 11:30.554
Scottie turned this thing into
this crazy, fully armored,

11:30.649 --> 11:32.856
mega-equipped weather lab
on wheels.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.774
I mean, it— it was like
a comic book-looking thing.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.978
I mean, I can’t believe
it wasn’t with him.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.484
- Was it valuable?
- Hell, yeah.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.531
He put every last penny
he had into that thing.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.155
Thing was probably worth,
I don’t know, hundred grand?

11:47.457 --> 11:51.041
Honey, I told you to leave
out of the side door.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.712

She— She made you breakfast?

11:54.798 --> 11:57.835
Yeah, I know, the— the smiley
face made out of blueberries.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.880

12:00.971 --> 12:02.302
Was that your mom again?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.971
No, that was a girl I met
at a bar last night.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.720

Something like that.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.551
Ugh, it’s infuriating.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.388
My mom said the rec room
was mine, my space.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.938
And this woman is still there
at your house, with your mom?
You have a son. You tell me.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.065
Is letting your child
have a simple,

12:19.156 --> 12:22.193
casual sexual encounter
really too much to ask for?

12:22.284 --> 12:26.277
Well, my son
is eight months old, Fisher.
He doesn’t date a lot.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.907
Yeah.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.705
You guys ready for me?
Yes, definitely.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.202
Okay, Fisher.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.376
Okay, the yellow area
indicates...

12:34.463 --> 12:37.421
the path of destruction caused
by the tornado last month.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.419
That’s about six miles long
by a thousand feet wide.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.718
And this mark here is where
the victim’s body was found.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.093
But if the tornado’s
what moved it, how did it
end up way over there?

12:47.184 --> 12:49.391
Logical question,
Dr. Saroyan,

12:49.478 --> 12:52.641
and one that was answered
in part three of
When WeatherAttacks.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.346
Angela?

12:54.441 --> 12:59.276
Once an object is picked up
by a tornado, it isn’t
carried and then set down.

12:59.363 --> 13:03.197
It’s, uh, spun around
and then flown.
More like a shot put.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.992
Would it be possible
to work backwards from
the location of the body find...

13:07.079 --> 13:10.162
to figure out where
along the tornado’s path
the victim was picked up?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.705
I’m not sure,
but I can try.

13:12.793 --> 13:16.832
Hey, the only difference
between “try” and “triumph”
is a little oomph.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.711
My mom puts motivational sayings
up on the fridge.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.384
Oh, God, she’s destroying me.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.143
So you think the killer
was another storm chaser?
That’s one possibility.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.104
I mean, who else is gonna
want that crazy van?
Good point.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.897
Well, like with any subculture,

13:37.985 --> 13:40.442
storm chasing attracts a variety
of distinct personality types.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.312
Adrenaline junkies.
Yeah. They’re the ones
most likely to, uh,

13:43.407 --> 13:45.443
put their lives
and the lives of others
in danger.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.611

They’re called—
Insane.

Hemorrhagic staining on
the interior of the skull...

13:55.210 --> 13:58.452

as blunt force trauma
to the head.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.458
Good. Good news.
Any thoughts on the weapon?

14:00.549 --> 14:04.258
Based on the fracture pattern,
we’re looking for
something cylindrical,

14:04.344 --> 14:07.086
with a diameter of between
five and seven centimeters.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.967
- Right. Like a baseball bat.
- Possibly, if it were
painted orange.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.637
Any luck on the mini-mojo?
The mini-moho.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.434
Mo— That’s what I meant.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.854
Yeah, a vehicle fitting
the description’s been parked
in North Carolina for days.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.899
So, uh, you know what?
I just sent a team
to check it out.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.068
What? Wait, why—
why aren’t we going?

14:23.155 --> 14:25.237
I-If there are other
storm chasers there,

14:25.323 --> 14:27.484
we’re missing the opportunity
to exploit their expertise...

14:27.576 --> 14:30.443
and learn about the nuances
of tornado behavior

14:30.537 --> 14:32.243
Eh, it’s a four-hour drive
there and back.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.161

good use of our time.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.662

I wish you’d consulted me first.

like you’re in the car.
- ’Cause I am in the car.

Look, do | ask you questions
about Daisy? No.

No. But if there’s something
you wanna know,
I’d be happy to—

There’s nothing I want to know,

I want to tell.

- Wait, I’m Misty Clemmons,
one of the project coordinators.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.778
Sorry, no tourists
on this run.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.531
- You’re Toni Lawrence, right?
- A fan. Nice to meet you.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.455
F.B.|. Special Agent Booth.
This here is Dr. Sweets.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.329
Yeah. We’re here to ask you
about your rivalry
with Scott Braley.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.830
Rivalry?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.583
I’ve got a four-vehicle crew,
a thriving tour service.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.290
I’m a regular commentator
on The Weather Channel.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.751
Scott’s a lone storm weirdo.
There’s no rivalry.

21:02.846 --> 21:05.804
Really?
You damaged his gas tank.
Sounds like a rivalry to me.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.506
If you’ll excuse me.
There’s a mesocyclone
developing.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.764
Meso— Oh!

21:11.855 --> 21:13.846
[ Toni ]
I’ve gotta get my crew
on the road.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.477
You gonna cut me some slack
for lying to Bones now?

21:16.568 --> 21:18.308
Yeah. No, you should—
totally should’ve lied.

21:20.029 --> 21:23.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second.
Look at the extinguisher
on her truck.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.481
[Toni]
Hurry up!
Let’s go, guys.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.237
Bones was telling me
about a potential
murder weapon.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.943
It’s the same
shape and color.
I gotta get this.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.787
[ Crashing ]
Agent Booth!

21:31.875 --> 21:34.833
Stop Toni and the crew
from leaving.
You understand?

21:35.962 --> 21:38.419
It’s all right, honey.
I’m more worried about you.

21:38.548 --> 21:42.336
Come on! Everyone into
the shelter for questioning.
No.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.544
- We have to get on the road—

Close the hatch!

22:24.344 --> 22:26.300
This is a big one.
This is huge.

22:26.387 --> 22:29.379
I didn’t think
we were gonna make it.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.519
- You lied to me!
- Bones, what are you doing?

22:33.603 --> 22:36.015
Get inside!
Come on. Easy.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.641
I couldn’t miss this.

22:40.944 --> 22:43.651
You know, you could’ve
killed yourself, Bones.
But I didn’t. I’m fine.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.353
How’d you even know
where to find us?

22:45.448 --> 22:46.949
I used the cell tower
ping method...

22:47.033 --> 22:50.116
that led us to
Vincent Nigel-Murray’s killer.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.410
This could definitely be
the murder weapon.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.987
I’m telling you,
I didn’t kill him.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.538
I didn’t even know
Scott was missing.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.742
Right, but you knew
that he wanted that
film contract, right?

22:58.836 --> 23:01.327
- [ Clattering Outside]
- [Toni] I cannot believe
you made us miss this.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.208
How about you? How long
you been working with her?

23:03.299 --> 23:05.210
Wait, wait, wait.
Don’t suck me into this.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.882
Look, l-l just shoot
the storms.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.211
Toni led me to the best footage,
and that’s as far as we go.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.264
I’ve been doing some reading
on the rotational behavior
of tornadoes.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.216
- Have either of you—
- Is this really relevant?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.222
This is my first
tornado case, Booth.
Find out—

23:17.313 --> 23:19.053
You know, you could’ve
just used the telephone.

23:19.148 --> 23:22.060
Well, I find it easier
to have direct conversation.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.982
Right. ’Cause it’s
always important
to have face time...

23:24.070 --> 23:26.482
right before
you’re about to get blown
into the side of a barn.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.734

23:28.825 --> 23:30.690

Man, this one’s huge.

23:30.785 --> 23:33.242
Okay, did you ever shoot film
with Scott Braley too?

23:33.329 --> 23:36.446
I tried. I met with him
in Virginia last month
during the storms there,

23:36.541 --> 23:39.533
and he said he’d call me
next time he went out,
but he never did though.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.960
Okay. Well, when that, uh,
huge tornado hit,
where were you?

23:43.047 --> 23:46.255
l was sitting in
my motel room like an idiot,
waiting for him to call.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.253
- I missed
the whole entire thing.

I’m missing another one.

Mother Nature is so incredible.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.431
Mother Nature is not real.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.804
Okay, how about you?
You have any dealings
with Scott?

23:57.895 --> 24:00.728
Oh, I don’t get to spend much
time with the actual chasers.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.680
I mostly just drive the film
back and forth.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.642
Mm-hmm. And I see you’re also
a big fan of, uh, rainbows.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.194

- I don’t know.

24:16.581 --> 24:20.119
I heard him on the phone
about a month and a half ago.
We were at the same rest stop.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.745
He was screaming at someone.
It was ugly.

24:21.836 --> 24:24.703
- Okay.
What were they arguing about?
- Sounded like money.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.540
From what I could tell,
whoever Scott was yelling at,
Scott owed a lot.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.485
The victim designed
these recording probes.

24:46.569 --> 24:51.063
He’d set ’em out in the path of
a tornado and then gather ’em up
after to download the data.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.772
It’s genius.

24:52.867 --> 24:56.200

aerodynamically designed
not to get blown away.

of Wacky Weather Wonders.

25:10.885 --> 25:14.548

out of balsa wood, got her
to oscillate on the top.

That’s funny.

26:14.323 --> 26:18.282
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is for me
to tell my father anything?

26:18.369 --> 26:20.746
All I want is for him
to just see things...

26:23.321 --> 26:23.416
from my perspective, right,
so I can get some sleep here,

26:23.416 --> 26:25.577
but he just insists
that he knows everything,
and it’s just—

26:25.668 --> 26:27.784
Angela.

26:27.879 --> 26:31.667
- Didn’t someone
get murdered?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

26:31.758 --> 26:36.548
So, based on the presence
of certain particulates...

26:36.637 --> 26:38.343
and the absence of others,

26:38.431 --> 26:41.594
we know that the victim
was spit out from the tornado...

26:41.684 --> 26:45.597
somewhere within
this red area here.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.851
Meaning he was
picked up somewhere
in this lower section.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.806
That’s still
a lot of area to search.

26:50.902 --> 26:53.393
I know. That’s why I tried
to narrow it down further.

26:53.488 --> 26:57.322
I looked at the particulate
density ratios and used
the probability index,

26:57.408 --> 27:00.491
and it suggests that the body
was picked up...

27:00.578 --> 27:04.036
somewhere within
this square mile.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.700
[Air Blowing]

27:08.795 --> 27:11.628
So I narrowed down
the area where
the victim was killed.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.705
Cam wants us to supervise
a search for the—

27:13.800 --> 27:16.257
murder site.

27:16.344 --> 27:19.006
You built a tornado
with a car seat on top?

27:19.096 --> 27:21.382
I call it
the Sleepytime Cyclone.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.432

to get Michael to fall asleep.

- What do you think?
- Honey, this is stupid.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.976

considering strapping
our precious baby...

a meth-addicted carny

27:37.782 --> 27:40.023

leave him alone
with my own father.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.699
Wow. You put it that way—

27:42.787 --> 27:44.652
We have to go on
this search anyway.

27:44.747 --> 27:48.581
And so my dad overloads
his little neurons.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.579
Michael will be fine.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.412

- You’re right.

28:20.241 --> 28:22.732
Great.

28:22.827 --> 28:26.536
You, uh, left me stranded
out there in the middle
of nowhere, you know.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.123
I wasn’t worried.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.495
Unlike you, I trust
my partner to be able
to take care of himself.

28:31.586 --> 28:35.078
You’re angry. You have
every right to be angry.
I understand that.

28:35.172 --> 28:38.209
So, uh, the fire extinguisher
on Toni’s truck.

28:38.301 --> 28:39.791
- Is that the, uh,
murder weapon?
- No.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.626
It didn’t match
the skull fractures
on the victim.

28:41.721 --> 28:44.838
Yeah, it doesn’t surprise me.
You know, her alibi
checks out too.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.433
This looks good.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.974
I did discover
some bone abrasions...

28:49.061 --> 28:51.848
that Fisher ascribed
to the victim’s
fall from the sky.

28:51.939 --> 28:55.352
But I think they happened
while he was still
inside the tornado.

28:55.443 --> 29:00.904
I might not have considered that
if! hadn’t talked
to the storm chasers.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.776
You’re not gonna
let this one go, are you?

29:02.867 --> 29:04.357
Not yet.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.073
What about
the victim’s finances?

29:08.164 --> 29:09.904
Did you find out
who he owed money to?

29:09.999 --> 29:13.332
Well, apparently there was
a backer who pretty much, uh,
bankrolled everything.

29:13.419 --> 29:17.082
Well, if he couldn’t pay back
the money he owed, then that
would be motive for murder.

29:17.173 --> 29:20.506
Definitely. And I got
the forensic accountants
checking into all that.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.594
Look, Bones,
I’m really sorry I lied.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.718
I’m really,
really sorry, Bones.

29:32.396 --> 29:35.980
You think you have the right
to control me because
I’m carrying your progeny.

29:36.067 --> 29:38.149
Do you think
maybe we could just
use the word “daughter”?

29:38.235 --> 29:41.193
I’m just trying
to protect you here.
That’s all.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.487
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Oh. Here we go.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.948
[ Beeps ]
There it is. Okay.

29:46.035 --> 29:48.401
I got the name of the person
who bankrolled our victim.

Let me show you what a show
in Cowboy Stadium in Dallas

30:44.719 --> 30:46.801
Why didn’t you tell us
you bankrolled your brother?

30:46.929 --> 30:49.591
I didn’t think
it was relevant.
Come on. Not relevant?

30:49.682 --> 30:52.674
Building up years of resentment
paying for a hobby
you thought was ridiculous?

30:52.768 --> 30:54.269
I didn’t think
it was ridiculous.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.184
You took out a life insurance
policy on your brother.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.638
- You stand to get
the money back on that.
- I invested a lot.

30:58.733 --> 31:00.394
That policy’s
just good business.

31:00.484 --> 31:03.817
I also bought him
disability, liability.
I cared about my brother.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.771
’Cause a witness says
that both of you
were arguing about, what,

31:06.866 --> 31:08.982
two months before
your brother died.

31:09.076 --> 31:11.738
You wanna tell us
what you were arguing about?

31:11.829 --> 31:13.069
Okay.

31:13.164 --> 31:15.530
Okay, maybe I was
a little sick of him
taking my money.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.831
- But we worked it out.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.599
- When I came home last night—
- Please, don’t explain.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.720
Dr. Brennan took some notes
on a Journal article.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.351
She wants you to assist her.

33:46.442 --> 33:50.276
Wow. She wants me to
determine the directionality
of every bone injury?

33:50.362 --> 33:51.898
Better you than me.

33:51.989 --> 33:54.822
But if most injuries
happened while the victim
was inside the tornado,

33:54.909 --> 33:56.524
then how does
directionality—

33:56.619 --> 34:00.658
Flip to page three.
Apparently, Dr. Brennan spoke
to one of the storm chasers,

34:00.748 --> 34:04.832
who said that 99%
of all tornadoes
in the Northern Hemisphere...

34:04.919 --> 34:07.535
rotate in a counterclockwise
direction.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.087
So, then, if we know
directionality,

34:10.174 --> 34:13.166
then we can extrapolate
the victim’s relative
body positions...

34:13.260 --> 34:15.797
within the tornado
at the time of each injury.

34:15.888 --> 34:18.880
This is totally
unexplored territory.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.465
We could wind up
on the cover of the Journal

34:21.560 --> 34:23.642
Dr. Saroyan?
I found something.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.316
[Chattering ]

34:31.820 --> 34:33.401
Broken glass?
Mm-hmm.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.650
I thought this was from
a destroyed structure at first,

34:35.741 --> 34:38.824
but it turns out it’s
a different tensile strength
than window glass.

34:38.911 --> 34:42.028
It’s 2.63 grams
per cubic centimeter.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.613
- Well, it’s covered in blood.
- Yeah, and it’s painted orange.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.950
- The same paint we found
in the victim’s skull wounds?
- You got it.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.127
The blood on the concrete
was a match for the victim.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.330
I’ll test this, too,
and see if it’s a match.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.507
Is this the same glass?
Yeah.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.461
It’s green.

35:01.475 --> 35:04.182
Okay. So we know that Scott
was out in the storm.

35:04.270 --> 35:07.478
Most likely with his mini-mojo,
since we know he set up
one of his probes.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.351
ll/lini-moho. And it ended up
back at Scott’s motel.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.104
Which would suggest that
the killer drove it back there.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.311
Perhaps we should interview
more storm chasers.

35:15.406 --> 35:18.739
No. No, we are not
going near any more storms.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.568

Yeah, and Booth,
so speak English.

35:28.961 --> 35:30.701
We’ve got a partial
murder weapon.

35:30.796 --> 35:34.288
It was a heavy-duty,
reusable glass water bottle.

35:34.383 --> 35:37.466
Doesn’t make any sense.
I mean, how do you get hit
three times with a glass bottle?

35:37.553 --> 35:39.009
It— It would break.

35:39.096 --> 35:43.180
The water bottle
uses a thick glass,
very high tensile strength.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.883
Plus, once it’s filled,
it weighs close to four pounds.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.514
[ Booth ]
Was it painted orange .7

35:47.604 --> 35:51.938

was killed by a friendly

Yeah, it’s my water bottle.
I’ve been looking for that.
Where’d you find it?

36:13.589 --> 36:16.956
We found it at
Scott Braley’s murder site.
Someone used it to kill him.

36:17.051 --> 36:18.791
Oh, God.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.878
Look, I have no idea.
I told you, I’ve never
even met that guy before.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.221
You sure about that?
Yeah, I’m pretty sure.

36:24.308 --> 36:27.596
But—
Oh, this is horrible.

36:27.686 --> 36:30.098
Why don’t you take
another look here, huh?

36:30.856 --> 36:32.016
Oh.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.438
Oh, gee.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.858
- What? What is it?
- I’ve never seen this man.
I swear.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.607
- But I know the van.
- The van?

36:39.698 --> 36:43.065
A couple of months ago
on one of my trips
to deliver film to Wes,

36:43.160 --> 36:46.027
I saw it parked at a motel
and there was this guy
getting out.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.700
A different guy.
And do you
remember his name?

36:48.791 --> 36:51.498
Yeah. Nolan.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.416
It was Nolan.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.665
I figured he was a storm chaser,
so I stopped to chat.

36:55.756 --> 36:57.587
I mean, those guys are all
so exciting, you know?

36:57.674 --> 37:01.542
And one thing
led to another, and...

37:01.637 --> 37:03.719
I must’ve left
my water bottle.

37:03.806 --> 37:05.888
And you had sex with him?

37:05.974 --> 37:09.967
It was wrong, I know.
I had a boyfriend,
but I just got carried away.

37:11.146 --> 37:13.307
Your boyfriend
is Wes, right?
The filmmaker.

37:13.399 --> 37:16.311
He broke up with me
a couple weeks after
I slept with Nolan.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.983
I don’t—

37:18.070 --> 37:20.732
Somehow he figured out
I cheated on him.

37:20.823 --> 37:21.812
Hmm.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.950
Booth thinks that
Misty’s boyfriend, Wes,

37:28.038 --> 37:30.324
went out with the victim
to get storm footage.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.249
But when Wes saw his
girlfriend’s water bottle
in Scott’s van,

37:33.335 --> 37:34.836
he thought
they slept together.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.037
So he got angry
and hit Scott over the head
with the water bottle.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.627
Murder by rainbow.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.628
Why the tornado footage?

37:42.719 --> 37:44.255
[ Brennan ]
This is Wes’s footage.

37:44.346 --> 37:49.386
He told us that
he was in a motel during
the tornado where Scott died.

37:49.476 --> 37:52.434
If we can link any of his
footage to the same tornado,

37:52.521 --> 37:53.977
we can prove
that he’s lying.

37:54.064 --> 37:56.476
We’re comparing the footage
that he took around that time...

37:56.567 --> 37:58.558
to the photos that I took
at the crime scene.

37:58.652 --> 38:04.192
We’re looking for any
topographical similarities,
structural Iandmarks— anything.

38:04.283 --> 38:07.025
- Smart.
- Yeah. Except it’s not working.

38:07.119 --> 38:09.861

besides the funnel cloud itself.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.537
This could be any tornado
on any given day.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.333
Wait. The directionality—
it’s unusual.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.957
- What do you mean?
- The storm chasers said...

38:19.047 --> 38:23.666
that virtually every tornado
in the Northern Hemisphere
rotates counterclockwise.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.378

highlight a piece of debris?

is rotating clockwise.

38:35.856 --> 38:37.642
It’s incredibly rare.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.065
If there was a way
that we could prove...

38:40.152 --> 38:44.145
that the tornado
that carried the victim
was also rotating clockwise—

38:44.239 --> 38:48.198

I thought we had fun together.

And when she made it very clear
that she didn’t want you
inviting women into the house,

40:04.611 --> 40:08.320

just easier to get her
to invite me herself.

So basically you’re asking me
to support your delusion.

42:46.815 --> 42:49.397
- Yes.
- That’s crazy.

[ Scoffs ]
You got a little bit
of the crazy in you too.

42:51.737 --> 42:54.729
Excuse me, but I am
a supremely rational person.

42:54.823 --> 42:57.485
Really? Walking around these
hardwood floors in bare feet.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.988
You could get a splinter.
I’m gonna go get your slippers.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.361
Oh, you’re starting again.
I told you
I wasn’t gonna stop.

43:02.456 --> 43:04.697
Do you want the ones
with the little bunny ears
or the slipper socks?

43:04.791 --> 43:06.292
What? No.
I’m not going to wear them.

43:06.418 --> 43:09.330
I’m not gonna pull a splinter
out of your feet.
I don’t have a splinter.

43:09.421 --> 43:11.161
You will. You will.
No, lwon’t.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.757
Yes, you will.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.202
What’s that mean?
