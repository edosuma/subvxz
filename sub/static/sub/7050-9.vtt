WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.628
Previously on Justified...

00:03.754 --> 00:07.006
We know Drew's alive and in Harlan,
but it's gonna be a bitch to find him.

00:07.091 --> 00:09.425
- We could use your help.
- Now we're getting to it.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.553
Theo Tonin knows Drew's alive, too,
and guess who he's got on his payroll.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.888
Boyd Crowder.

00:13.972 --> 00:17.475
You might start with the other guys
Boyd's been seen with lately.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.727
Lee Paxton and Gerald Johns.

00:19.812 --> 00:23.523
One of your fellow inmates is cutting a deal
to get a transfer to club fed.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.608
You give him up first, deal's yours.

00:25.776 --> 00:29.278
This fellow inmate wouldn't happen
to share a last name with you, would he?

00:32.825 --> 00:34.200
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.702
Can we get back to the case?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.620
I want to know who put the hurt on you?

00:37.746 --> 00:40.415
He was tweaking and pissed off,
asking about Ellen May.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.666
Ellen May?

00:41.917 --> 00:44.001
Where she is or did she call or some shit.

00:44.128 --> 00:45.545
Hey, Boyd Crowder's ride.

00:45.629 --> 00:46.963
You here for a check-up?

00:47.131 --> 00:48.256
Yeah, I got a

00:49.591 --> 00:51.050
Bagram lung.

00:51.135 --> 00:52.760
What can I get you? Same as before?

00:52.845 --> 00:53.970
No. I need 20 grand.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.852
I know you. We met at the VA.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.145
You were with that marshal.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.479
Oh, yeah. Right.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.618
Popped in the chest, both of them.

01:18.620 --> 01:22.582
One in his skivvies drug himself
clear across the floor to get to his phone.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.042
Rather than call 911, he texts you.

01:25.169 --> 01:28.546
Think you can shed some light
on to what this text here is about?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.840
"Bagram," it says... One word.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.593
It's an air base we flew out of
back in the sandbox.

01:33.677 --> 01:34.719
Other than that...

01:34.845 --> 01:37.305
Must have thought it was pretty important,
being his last word.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.434
Dealer Dave, he don't look like much,

01:41.518 --> 01:43.853
but he was third battalion
fifth marines in Fallujah,

01:43.979 --> 01:46.522
and he knew everything there is to know
about weapon retention.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.983
Hence, the skivvies and the safe area.

01:49.318 --> 01:50.777
Point is,

01:50.861 --> 01:53.863
he dealt primarily to veterans.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.657
Are you sure you can't think
of any connection,

01:56.784 --> 01:58.201
given your service background?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.453
I was never anywhere near Fallujah.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.038
And your friend?

02:02.498 --> 02:04.207
He was having some troubles,

02:04.792 --> 02:06.042
is all I know.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.211
Anything else?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.214
Deputy Marshal Gutterson,
if you think of anything,

02:11.340 --> 02:13.466
any window into this mess,

02:14.051 --> 02:15.218
you'll let us know?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.179
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Thanks.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.058
Thought you were never gonna get here.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.227
You in that big a hurry
to transfer to supermax?

02:24.353 --> 02:26.562
Ride on a bus couple hours, see the sun?

02:26.730 --> 02:28.481
That's like a carnival cruise.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.233
Yeah, you say so.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.529
It's all there.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.073
All right, sunshine. You got your tan.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.825
Let's hit the road.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.244
You think maybe
I could roll down a window?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.745
We'll see.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.417
Hey, they're leaving without me.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.844
Hell no. What's this bullshit?

02:59.221 --> 03:00.763
Hello, Hunter.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.548
Are you shitting me?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.550
You let Raylan take him?

03:37.801 --> 03:38.968
Holy shit.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.137
He said it was a late birthday present.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.723
Arlo Givens' body not even cold on the slab,

03:43.807 --> 03:46.851
and you let Raylan drive off
into the sunset with his killer!

03:46.935 --> 03:48.978
Have you lost your mind?

03:50.272 --> 03:51.731
Where is he?

03:51.899 --> 03:55.359
Tell me he's in Leoville,
dropping off the prisoner like a good boy.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.947
Not unless they moved it to Harlan,
'cause transponder's got him around Baxter.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.490
God damn it.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.242
God damn it!

04:03.368 --> 04:04.619
You want me to go up and get him?

04:04.703 --> 04:06.662
I want you to sit your ass down

04:06.747 --> 04:11.542
and get used to purging case files
until I figure out how to like you again!

04:12.169 --> 04:14.378
- Do you want me to call him?
- Yes, call him

04:14.463 --> 04:17.589
and articulate to him my extreme displeasure.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.051
And let him know that
if anything happens to Sheriff Hunter

04:20.135 --> 04:21.302
while in his custody,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.096
he will no longer be a marshal
and neither will I.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.432
And that is where his nightmare will begin.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.100
Do you want me to write that down,
or paraphrase?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.226
Don't be a smartass!

04:32.147 --> 04:34.273
And all the rest of you,
I'm gonna spend the rest of my day

04:34.358 --> 04:37.401
calling local law enforcement
and putting bolos out on assholes.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.487
So if anybody wants
to screw anything else up,

04:39.571 --> 04:41.989
just wait till tomorrow. God damn it.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.495
So, what then?

04:47.663 --> 04:48.788
"What then," what?

04:48.872 --> 04:51.248
This is what it's gonna be like,

04:51.333 --> 04:53.417
you riding up there all quiet
like you're Harry Callahan

04:53.502 --> 04:55.711
and I'm supposed
to be back here shitting myself?

04:55.796 --> 04:58.756
Lord, I hope not.
I'm trapped in the car with you.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.508
So then it's, "He tried to escape,

05:00.592 --> 05:02.593
"so I had to shoot him down
by the side of the road?"

05:02.678 --> 05:06.722
Hunter, I am a Deputy US Marshal,
executing a prison transport.

05:07.015 --> 05:11.852
You think I'm stupid? Want to wind up
in your old cell when this is over?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.980
You're calling 'cause Art's pissed.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.816
- You have no idea.
- I got some.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.068
How is Deputy Dunlop faring?

05:19.236 --> 05:22.321
Well, he's looking at a bright future
in mall security, thanks to you.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.489
I'll make it up to him.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.075
You got to know better
than thinking you can hurt this guy.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.577
I can hurt him a little, can't I?

05:28.745 --> 05:29.745
Raylan.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.747
I'm just gonna sort a few things out

05:31.832 --> 05:34.834
before I drop the man
off safe and sound at Leoville.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.252
Such as?

05:36.420 --> 05:39.255
I just want to know who hired him to hit Arlo.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.299
Dixie Mafia, maybe. That's my first thought.

05:42.426 --> 05:46.637
Could be Boyd, but given their history,
I don't know how that works.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.973
You know Art's got locals out
looking for you.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.184
- To be expected.
- Meaning maybe you could use a little help.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.437
Yeah. Help how?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.522
I could tell Art I got your voicemail,

05:56.773 --> 06:00.401
buy you a little time to do whatever it is
you got in your head.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.237
I could come up to Harlan,
poke around the Crowder place.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.448
I appreciate that, Tim,
but don't put yourself out.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.325
I mean, you go up that way,
it's bound to blow south.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.369
And, besides, I got something
I want to check out anyway.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.496
I got to go. This is our stop.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.004
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell is this?

06:20.130 --> 06:21.464
Oh, this?

06:21.548 --> 06:24.300
This is where I start to find out what's what.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.475
Deputy, I'm not sure
I understand exactly what it is you're after.

06:32.642 --> 06:37.146
Hunter, you remember back in the day,
Arlo got picked up for assault?

06:38.315 --> 06:40.483
Something to do with
Johnson McClaren's dog?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.323
Johnson McClaren's dog?

06:47.491 --> 06:49.825
Oh, the dog was shitting on your lawn.

06:50.702 --> 06:55.081
Arlo roughed up McClaren over it
and I arrested him. Jesus, God.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.541
All that dog did was bark and shit,

06:57.667 --> 07:00.836
like one thing had something
to do with the other.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.505
Some kind of collie mix, I think.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.673
I had a yorkie, growing up.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.177
- May I ask...
- Now accusations are flying every which way.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.679
The McClarens are gunning up
to go after the Givens.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.682
The Givens are calling on the Crowders
to go after the Sorensons,

07:13.809 --> 07:15.351
who are kin to the McClarens.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.186
It sounds like a complicated time.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.063
Until my mama, Frances.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.397
Remember what she did, Hunter?

07:23.693 --> 07:24.902
She called a meeting.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.863
She said it was time
we all got together and hash it out.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.825
She had some French blood in her, I believe,

07:30.909 --> 07:33.410
and she told us how the term "hashing it out"

07:33.537 --> 07:36.038
came from the French word "hatchet,"

07:36.540 --> 07:38.541
meaning to cut through all the bullshit.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.335
And your idea
of cutting through the bullshit is

07:41.545 --> 07:44.296
you showing up at my motor coach
with a prisoner in tow?

07:44.506 --> 07:46.841
This prisoner is one Hunter Mosley.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.177
And he may be the only person I know alive

07:51.054 --> 07:52.221
who knows Drew Thompson.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.561
Well, now.
Mr Mosley is being transported to supermax

07:58.728 --> 08:02.523
in the recent wake
of putting a shiv in Arlo Givens,

08:02.732 --> 08:04.233
such to end his life.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.235
So I figure,

08:06.361 --> 08:09.071
Dixie Mafia has got
a history with Arlo and Drew.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.907
Why not put the two of you together
and see what shakes out?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.659
I'm sorry. Wait.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.495
Are you saying Arlo is dead?

08:16.580 --> 08:17.997
You don't seem happy.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.834
I figured, if you ordered the hit,
we'd all be drinking Wild Turkey by now.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.420
Deputy Marshal,
I am truly sorry for your loss,

08:25.422 --> 08:27.381
but you have to understand,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.175
I had no idea.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.178
Thank you, Wynn.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.431
Whatever your other failings,
I believe that's true.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.352
Dixie Mafia has no skin in the kill-Arlo game.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.270
I mean, if they kill Arlo,
how are they gonna find the man

08:42.397 --> 08:45.232
they're looking for,
which is to say, Drew Thompson?

08:46.943 --> 08:48.194
Since you're here already,

08:48.278 --> 08:50.279
maybe I could help you
take care of this right now.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.530
Could be fun...

08:51.615 --> 08:54.783
Noodling on ideas about
what to do with Mr Hunter.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.918
It's only been on the market a week.
It's gonna go fast.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.088
Well, you always said you wanted a garden.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.965
That's a garden.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.761
Lord, it's like a storybook.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.389
Storybook is right,
right down to the rosebushes

09:17.474 --> 09:19.600
and the white picket fence.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.646
There's a sheet with all the specs,
although the house speaks for itself,

09:23.772 --> 09:25.731
glorious views out of every window.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.326
Fully integrated security system,
as you just noticed.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.079
Honey, don't you know
opening anything will set it off?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.165
Sorry.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.751
Baby.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.503
What do you think, baby?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.340
A 60-inch television screen
and my daddy's 14-point buck?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.261
Boyd?

09:58.640 --> 10:00.266
Ava, what is it?

10:00.642 --> 10:02.518
That's the maid's room, there.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.482
And that's the laundry room.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.859
And that's a walk-in closet.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.363
Then I think you go through here.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.824
There's a den.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.328
It leads to the outside.

10:22.706 --> 10:26.333
And there should be a fountain
across the yard, in the corner.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.377
How do you know all this?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.798
When my mama used to clean this house,
the maids used to come through the back,

10:32.882 --> 10:36.051
but I remember that little room
and playing in the fountain.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.721
I never knew that about your mama.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.725
So she cleaned a lot of houses
up here in Clover Hill?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.893
They'd smile at her real nice.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.730
But they locked up their jewellery
whenever she came over.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.817
So, do you like what you see so far?

10:51.901 --> 10:53.485
It's a big place.

10:53.570 --> 10:57.656
I don't know if you got help,
but it's a lot of house to clean on your own.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.410
- Can we see the outside?
- Of course.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.415
It sits on over an acre of grass.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.250
Again, a lot of upkeep.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.754
Are you sure I can't show you something
a little further down the Hill?

11:11.880 --> 11:14.173
There are some lovely
starter homes down there,

11:14.257 --> 11:16.175
beautiful views, quaint.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.927
- You and your husband might...
- Fiancé.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.723
You and your fiancé
might want to think about the commute.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.725
What kind of work did you say you do?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.268
We didn't.

11:26.436 --> 11:30.439
I ask because the banks are getting
very stringent with applications.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.609
Honey, I didn't know any better,

11:33.693 --> 11:36.862
I'd say our realtor is implying
we ain't got the means to buy up here.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.031
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean anything of the sort.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.699
I was just pointing out that the banks...

11:40.784 --> 11:44.203
Whatever home we buy,
we'll buy it outright, pay cash,

11:44.287 --> 11:47.122
obviating the need
to get in the gutter with the banks.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.791
Ava, honey.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.460
Maybe real-estate agents
are like new houses,

11:51.586 --> 11:53.796
you shouldn't fall in love with the first one.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.300
Mr Crowder. Now, wait a minute. I...

11:58.426 --> 11:59.802
Thank you very much.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.971
But we don't need your shit.
You have a nice day.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.770
It's a beautiful house. I say we buy it.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.940
I'll put your mama's name on a plaque
and put it on the front door.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.650
I love calling you fiancé.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.777
As much as I love hearing it.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.195
But you know what?

12:18.321 --> 12:22.449
I think you and your mama just got me
one step closer to finding Drew Thompson.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.833
What would you have done
if Duffy hadn't have stood aside?

12:30.959 --> 12:32.793
Duffy knows me. We have a history.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.004
Point is, he'll send someone
for you in prison.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.633
You're gonna die in Leoville, Hunter,

12:39.717 --> 12:41.510
sooner, not later.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.347
You think, huh?

12:46.015 --> 12:49.393
- Maybe I'm a little craftier than I look.
- Maybe you don't need to be.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.354
- What does that mean?
- It means I offered you a deal.

12:52.647 --> 12:56.024
Well, a lot has happened since then.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.068
Nonetheless, the deal stands.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.528
Give me Drew,

12:59.654 --> 13:01.530
you can write your own ticket
to a better place.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.908
God.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.843
What the hell is the matter with you?

13:24.345 --> 13:26.847
You want to die in the street? Is that it?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.267
And you think I'm gonna let that happen?

13:31.019 --> 13:32.227
What the hell are you doing?

13:40.695 --> 13:45.365
In the words of Arlo Givens, "I'm trying
to knock some goddamn sense into you."

13:49.704 --> 13:51.413
What are you so afraid of?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.541
You'd rather die here
than give me what I'm after.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.876
Shoot me.

13:57.045 --> 14:00.422
Put me in the car. Take me to Leoville.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.892
Arnold, you know we take care
of our longtime customers.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.603
Just to show that we at Audry's
got no hard feelings...

14:14.729 --> 14:17.356
I believe my sufferings
earned me many, many free visits.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.774
Absolutely.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.068
Now, you sit right here.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.736
I got a surprise for you.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.113
It better not be some dumb whore
popping caps at me.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.449
You just count to three
and take that thing off.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.992
All right.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.955
One, two,

14:33.081 --> 14:34.248
three!

14:34.666 --> 14:36.667
- Surprise.
- God damn it.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.175
Are you sure
you're in the right place, honey?

14:46.261 --> 14:47.636
I'm here looking for Ellen May.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.639
Oh, you're a friend of Ellen May's?

14:50.765 --> 14:52.349
More like an acquaintance.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.476
She was a member
of my brother's congregation.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.144
Oh, I heard about all that.

14:56.521 --> 14:57.646
You poor thing.

14:58.273 --> 15:01.525
Ellen May moved on.
She took to Alabama is what I heard.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.485
Heard the word. Took it to heart.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.989
Said something about
working at a church out there.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.824
I'm sorry. Did you say Alabama?

15:09.117 --> 15:12.494
She didn't leave an address,
but if I hear from her,

15:12.662 --> 15:14.454
I could try to leave a message.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.832
What is it, sugar?

15:18.293 --> 15:20.586
She left word with
one of our former parishioners,

15:20.670 --> 15:21.837
seeking guidance...

15:22.297 --> 15:24.172
Said she was all tore up about something.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.717
When was this?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.135
Yesterday.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.179
Well, that is strange.

15:31.306 --> 15:34.725
She didn't say where she'd be,
but I just reckoned it'd be here.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.520
If you see her, will you be sure
and tell her that I'm praying for her?

15:38.730 --> 15:42.816
If she needs me, I'll be at the church
or Lacey's garage, getting my truck fixed.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.361
Okay, then. Have a wonderful day.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.655
Bye.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.872
Now, you got your start
in the security business.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.206
Am I right?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.000
I'm looking for somebody...

16:00.710 --> 16:03.795
Could have been an employee of yours.
He would have been a new employee.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.548
He worked security for you
back in the '80s, up on the Hill.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.426
What is it?

16:11.262 --> 16:13.096
We got a problem.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.406
Is that you, Shelby?

16:31.783 --> 16:33.033
Deputy Givens.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.577
Locals got a bolo on you.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.120
A bit concerned,

16:37.246 --> 16:39.748
they claim you wandered somewhat afield
of your destination.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.918
Just want to make sure Hunter here
gets a chance to see the sights

16:43.002 --> 16:44.252
before we get to Leoville.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.588
I don't suppose you've come to rescue me.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.341
Well, I've come to make sure
you hadn't been took hostage.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.427
Given Hunter's appearance,
maybe I ought to be worried the other way.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.680
Injuries sustained
in the course of trying to throw himself

16:54.764 --> 16:56.431
in front of a tanker truck.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.767
Sooner kill himself than tell me
what I want to know.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.770
You know I'm supposed to take you in,
convey you to the marshals service.

17:01.979 --> 17:06.108
The deal is simple, one name, he wins.
Seems like a no-brainer to me.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.361
Well, here's what I'd do.
Sweat him another half-hour.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.946
Maybe he takes the deal, maybe he doesn't.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.281
Either way, you've done what you could.
You move on.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.787
Or I drive him around another half-hour,
he doesn't want to take the deal,

17:18.871 --> 17:22.207
I press a gun against his ear,
send him where he wants to go.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.625
And you got no other plan?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.627
I got Constable Bob Sweeney up
at Lee Paxton's hunting lodge,

17:26.713 --> 17:28.880
looking into possibilities
for Drew Thompson.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.590
Could be Gerald, could be Lee.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.385
I figured maybe I'd drag him in front of them,
see what shakes out.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.096
Well, Paxton and Gerald
are bound to be a bit jumpy,

17:36.180 --> 17:39.057
likely gunned up in the wake
of their friends being took out.

17:39.851 --> 17:40.976
Leave my car here.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.061
I'll ride with you all. We'll see what's what.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.485
Hey, Boyd. What's going on?

17:55.992 --> 18:00.078
Preacher Billy's sister,
Cassie, came into Audry's,

18:00.371 --> 18:02.247
saying Ellen May left word for her.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.501
- Left word? Do you mean before...
- I mean left word for her yesterday.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.716
Now, you understand
why this has caused us a little concern?

18:12.842 --> 18:13.842
That's not possible.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.844
Ellen May is dead and gone

18:15.928 --> 18:19.681
and there's no way she's leaving word
about anything to anybody.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.018
Then what the hell is going on?

18:25.688 --> 18:27.355
Look, she came into town on a grift

18:28.107 --> 18:30.692
with her milked snakes,
her arms out for cash.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.362
Now, likely as not,
she's just angling for another payday.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.281
I got a bad feeling about this, Boyd.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.283
- Something ain't right.
- She's fishing.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.453
Now, something Ellen May told her.
She isn't sure.

18:42.038 --> 18:46.875
She'll toss in the dynamite, close the door,
wait and see what we do.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.295
Now, she said she's either gonna be in town
at the garage or at her church.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.464
- You think you can handle the church?
- What do you want me to do?

18:52.548 --> 18:54.090
Right now, I just want her found.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.802
Now, I'll go into town.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.596
You call me if you find her.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.723
All right.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.230
She came looking for you.
She ain't gonna be hard to find.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.733
And when we find her, we'll bring her back
here and hear what her game is.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.765
Shit! Shit! Shit!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.326
So, what do you got?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.328
I don't get a "hello"?

20:47.747 --> 20:50.582
Hello. You called me. What?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.669
I saw Ava and some woman
I've never seen before,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.004
talking about Ellen May,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.173
looking all serious.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.052
Come on. Come on.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.058
- What woman?
- I don't want anything

21:08.184 --> 21:09.517
I told you coming back on me, Johnny.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.353
No, you don't
need to worry about Ava right now.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.188
You need to worry about me. Understand?

21:14.690 --> 21:17.567
Now, I need you
to tell me exactly what you heard.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.737
So, wait. Who's Wynn Duffy?

21:21.197 --> 21:25.075
Dixie Mafia such-and-such,
tools around in a motor coach. Don't matter.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.701
And you went there to what end?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.620
I figured, if he put the hit on Arlo,

21:28.746 --> 21:31.706
maybe I'd suss it out,
having Hunter there in front of him.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.041
But he didn't.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.668
I don't believe so, no.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.212
That means Drew
put the hit out himself, or...

21:37.755 --> 21:39.422
- Maybe Crowders.
- Yeah.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.133
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You have something to say now?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.719
Oh, you think as I'd so much
as piss on a Crowder

21:44.804 --> 21:47.472
if he's afire,
you really are chasing your own dick.

21:47.682 --> 21:50.308
Still haven't forgiven
the clan for what the one did.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.769
No, Raylan,
I haven't forgiven Henry Crowder raping,

21:52.853 --> 21:55.188
torturing, and murdering my niece.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.856
Don't mean you wouldn't take their money.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.692
A feud ain't about money

21:59.026 --> 22:00.735
and it ain't done till it's done.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.696
Me and the Crowders, we ain't done.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.448
Tough, keeping up a beef
from a supermax cell.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.325
You was the one brought it up.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.537
Arlo kicking up a feud over some
dog pooping in your yard.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.373
That's Arlo for you.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.958
Yeah, only you remember it the wrong way.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.252
He's right. Dog was incidental.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.423
Johnson McClaren
verbally assaulted your mother, Frances.

22:21.507 --> 22:25.176
Arlo saw fit to shove
a pound of dog shit down his dirty mouth.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.928
Kind of poetic justice.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.681
Assaulted how?

22:29.807 --> 22:33.184
He made implications
around town as to her proclivities,

22:33.269 --> 22:36.104
things he'd like to see her do.
Pushed it too far.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.023
Frances took the high road,

22:38.190 --> 22:41.317
called a truce,
although she had every right to be affronted.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.194
Your daddy was protecting her honour.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.824
Arlo did that?

22:51.454 --> 22:53.872
Frances took a path I never could.

22:55.458 --> 22:59.169
I'd put down Henry Crowder again,
whatever it took,

22:59.503 --> 23:02.047
and again and again, same way each time.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.632
Once you make a decision,
set down the path,

23:05.301 --> 23:10.138
you follow it right to the end,
at least, that's the way I always saw it.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.683
Hunter, are you trying
to tell us this is all about honour for you?

23:13.893 --> 23:17.729
I'm talking about who we are.
'Cause that's why we do what we do.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.982
Well, if Drew don't want
to see you die keeping his secret,

23:21.067 --> 23:23.318
maybe you'll get lucky and he'll step up.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.988
Otherwise, you got a short, ugly road

23:27.156 --> 23:30.241
once the Dixie Mafia gets
a hold of you in Leoville.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.749
She wasn't at the garage...
Not anywhere in town I could find.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.000
Did you hear from Colt?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.419
No. But we will.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.963
Cassie coming into Audry's?
What the hell is going on?

23:44.048 --> 23:46.132
The wind ain't done blowing yet.
Colton's checking it out.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.884
How long does it take
to get to that church anyway?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.177
Baby, you know as well as I do,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.096
you can't get any cell service
up in that holler.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.099
- Colt's checking it out?
- Isn't that what I just said?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.185
You can't trust Colt.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.187
What are you saying?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.861
I'm saying the man's a liar.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.281
He never killed Ellen May.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.914
Well, cousin Johnny,

24:18.040 --> 24:20.750
Ava and I have been trying
to put together a puzzle,

24:21.127 --> 24:23.962
and it seems like you have
some of the missing pieces.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.464
Why don't you start from the beginning?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.643
You got to understand, Boyd,

24:38.727 --> 24:40.478
I didn't want to accuse him
without something solid.

24:43.399 --> 24:46.901
You brought him in here,
put him up in that catbird seat over me...

24:48.070 --> 24:50.071
Some clown I never even met before.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.574
And he ain't kin...

24:52.658 --> 24:54.576
Wasn't even in your damn unit over there.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.912
But he was your friend,
so I didn't know what I could do.

24:58.122 --> 25:02.500
So when you suspect he's been lying to us,
you do absolutely nothing.

25:04.503 --> 25:08.173
I was there for Devil.
I have always been there for you.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.524
Sorry, friend, church is closed.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.527
Most of the congregation
moved down to Green Rock Holler.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.491
I know you.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.998
You're hurting.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.458
Medicated.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.298
Trying to numb the pain of your sins.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.136
But you feel trapped, don't you?

25:56.180 --> 25:59.307
By the drugs, by the weight of it all?

26:00.392 --> 26:01.809
You come seeking solace?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.563
I come looking for Ellen May.

26:06.148 --> 26:09.859
Well, she's not here,
that much I can guarantee you.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.570
Let me help you.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.199
Don't you want to be free
from the devil's grip?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.202
Where is she?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.162
Where's Ellen May?

26:23.999 --> 26:26.376
- No!
- Where is she? You playing with me?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.336
- Don't!
- Did you send me that text?

26:28.712 --> 26:29.921
Where is she?

26:30.506 --> 26:32.006
Where the hell is she?

26:33.509 --> 26:36.010
Let her go. Right now! Let her go!

26:39.556 --> 26:41.683
Deputy US Marshal. Are you all right, Miss?

26:43.519 --> 26:45.311
- This isn't your business.
- I'm making it my business.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.397
You remember me, Bagram lung?

26:47.564 --> 26:49.274
Your cough seems to have cleared up.

26:53.696 --> 26:58.074
My friend Mark from the VA
got killed at his dealer's place.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.369
I don't remember you being this quiet
last we met.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.413
Did you kill my friend?

27:16.885 --> 27:18.303
I wouldn't.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.596
You're not drawing on junkies
and dealers now.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.140
Miss Cassie?

27:22.266 --> 27:24.225
You stay right where you are.
Deputy US Marshal.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.810
I know who you are, Deputy.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.732
Miss Cassie, I offer my deepest apologies
for my associate's behaviour.

27:30.816 --> 27:34.277
Now, with your permission, Officer,
I just want to take my friend with me.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.863
I will make sure that his transgressions
are properly punished.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.406
You have my word.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.492
Colt, put the gun away.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.961
Now, all we want is to leave in peace.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.465
Need I remind you
that you are an officer of the peace?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.390
Thank you.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.109
Boyd, I'm telling you, she knows something.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.320
I'm sure she does.
We'll clear it up soon enough.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.406
- My truck.
- Let Johnny take it. You ride with me.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.242
When we get back to the barn,
you can tell me what's what.

28:23.327 --> 28:24.452
Keys.

29:06.829 --> 29:09.247
Constable Bob. What brings you up here?

29:09.331 --> 29:11.624
Mr Paxton, I'm here on marshal business.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.794
I've been tasked
with gathering you for a meeting.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.338
So, could you put your gun down, please?

29:17.423 --> 29:21.717
Marshals must have fallen on hard times,
sending you to do their business.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.721
What, did they run out of chimpanzees on
their way down the food chain?

29:26.265 --> 29:27.598
Go on home, Bob.

29:27.683 --> 29:31.185
Some bad men headed this way,
looking to put a hurt on me and Gerald.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.687
We got this.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.730
Lee, hang on! Just...

29:35.524 --> 29:38.443
My name's Mr Paxton,
as far as you're concerned.

29:38.569 --> 29:42.405
You touch my door again,
I'm within my rights to shove this barrel

29:42.739 --> 29:45.032
right down your fat, little throat.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.076
Look, there's no reason
to get nasty, all right?

29:47.161 --> 29:50.413
You just go on home, boy.
Play cops and robbers in the mirror.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.554
You go play asshole in the mirror, Lee.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.978
How about I shove
my foot down your goddamn throat!

30:14.188 --> 30:17.023
Hey, are you deaf?
I told you to get the hell off my property.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.858
I told you to drop that weapon right now!

30:19.026 --> 30:20.735
What the hell is going on out here?

30:21.028 --> 30:22.987
Both of you disarm!

30:24.156 --> 30:27.450
Well, midget police is here.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.035
Aim low, Lee.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.746
You drop your guns! That's an order!

30:38.670 --> 30:40.004
What in the hell?

30:40.088 --> 30:41.547
God damn it, Bob.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.889
- Down! Stop it!
- You put it down!

30:50.474 --> 30:51.599
Go home, you little shit!

31:04.446 --> 31:06.405
I'll show you midget police.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.212
- Here we go.
- I'll cover the back.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.755
Sit tight. Try not to catch a stray.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.842
US Marshals! Everybody stop shooting!

31:27.010 --> 31:29.303
- Cops and robbers!
- Bob! Stop it!

31:30.097 --> 31:31.472
Everybody calm down!

31:32.140 --> 31:34.600
- Tell that goddamn nutball to stop!
- Shut up.

31:35.811 --> 31:38.229
Guns down. Hands up.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.404
You too, Bob. Put the goddamn gun down.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.699
Sorry. They just kept pressing my buttons!

31:49.783 --> 31:53.202
All right. Just... Take a moment.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.164
You got cuffs small enough to fit him?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.668
He wasn't the only one shooting,
if I'm not mistaken.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.464
We're within our right to protect property.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.258
Save it. Don't give a shit.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.260
I'm here about Drew Thompson.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.944
Sorry about Arlo.
Should have been clean and easy.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.031
He was a tough old bird, that guy.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.121
You stood up for me.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.166
I told you I'd keep your secret, and I did.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.209
- I was trying to tell you on the drive up here.
- I know.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.419
I always knew.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.465
So what now... Drew?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.982
Now I pull the ripcord for real.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.904
I'm grateful for what you've done, I truly am.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.492
You take care now.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.297
Wouldn't be hard finding out
if Hunter owed either of you something,

33:28.382 --> 33:29.840
reason to go after Arlo.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.385
Wait, so that's what it's about?

33:32.636 --> 33:36.013
Some hit on your daddy
connected him to Hunter Mosley.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.600
Jailbird, ex-lawman in the mob's pocket...

33:39.685 --> 33:42.687
Hey, that ain't how it was.
Hunter got himself in a bind.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.272
Bob, as much as I value your contributions...

33:45.357 --> 33:48.275
Right, but everything
this guy's saying is bullshit, all right?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.528
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that is right.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.738
Hunter and Shelby
looked after me when I first come here,

33:52.823 --> 33:54.865
on account of that kid, Ollie Kemp.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.076
I put him in a coma.
Did I tell you about that?

33:57.160 --> 33:59.537
I did? Well, they did right by me.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.580
A lot of people were looking
to put a lot of hurt on me

34:01.665 --> 34:05.126
'cause of what I did to that kid,
and those two were just partnered up.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.795
Hunter was barely a recruit,
still took care of my juvie probation,

34:08.880 --> 34:10.589
still got me the job at the Sav-More.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.675
Even when Shelby took the fall for Hunter,

34:12.759 --> 34:15.219
I knew I was lucky
having those guys looking after me...

34:15.303 --> 34:17.054
Say that again. Shelby did what?

34:17.347 --> 34:19.514
Well, Hunter went after Henry Crowder,

34:19.599 --> 34:22.560
Crowder disappeared,
and Miami got involved.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.770
There was all these hard eyes
on the sheriff's department,

34:24.855 --> 34:27.313
but Shelby took the heat...
You know, just acted the scapegoat.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.525
Did some back-channel deals

34:29.609 --> 34:31.527
so that Hunter
could continue on in his career.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.779
That's when Shelby got into mine security.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.239
And even then,

34:35.322 --> 34:37.491
Shelby put a word in for me at the academy.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.284
Of course, they gypped me on the physical

34:39.369 --> 34:41.704
and had me run
that goddamn obstacle course

34:41.788 --> 34:43.246
in the spring, with the pollen.

34:55.844 --> 34:59.180
I guess we about hashed through
all the bullshit now, didn't we, Raylan?

34:59.848 --> 35:01.891
Hey, where the hell is my patrol cruiser?

35:03.101 --> 35:04.435
Keep an eye on him.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.313
Just keep an eye on him.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.484
A bullet to the head, right?

35:11.693 --> 35:12.902
What?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.945
How you killed Ellen May?

35:15.322 --> 35:18.824
You put a bullet right in her brain.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.618
Yeah, and, well, she didn't feel a thing.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.870
What kind of gun did you use?

35:22.954 --> 35:24.038
The .45.

35:25.624 --> 35:26.791
Back of the head.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.211
She's so small and light,
it nearly blew it clear off.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.506
Can I see it?

35:46.186 --> 35:47.728
You didn't dump it?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.897
Hell no, I didn't dump it.
That's my service weapon.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.733
I smuggled that
all the way back from Kandahar.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.570
Don't worry, that slurry chemicals,
they're gonna kill all the ballistics.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.823
And I don't want to part with that.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.991
But you did it at the pond.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.996
No, it was the woods
on the way up to the slurry.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.498
I told you all of this already.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.460
I like a .45.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.963
It's a very powerful gun.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.966
You can stop a very big boy with it.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.260
But me, myself,

36:20.136 --> 36:21.762
I prefer a nine mill.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.350
Show me.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.020
- What?
- Point this gun at the back of my head

36:30.105 --> 36:32.439
and show me exactly
where you pulled the trigger.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.109
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I'm very serious.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.214
It's right there.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.347
Well, why not in the front,

37:06.474 --> 37:07.808
like this?

37:09.436 --> 37:11.520
Because I didn't want to scare her.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.357
Why?

37:20.614 --> 37:21.697
Why what?

37:21.865 --> 37:23.616
Why are you lying to me, Colt?

37:25.160 --> 37:26.911
What's going on here, Boyd?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.623
We know you didn't kill Ellen May.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.459
The lying stops right now.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.547
Boyd.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.424
Tell me.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.426
Just tell me.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.308
I don't know what it...

37:49.392 --> 37:51.352
Beating on Teri and asking about Ellen May?

37:51.478 --> 37:53.187
That was a big-ass mistake.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.856
Tell me the truth, Colt.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.609
Tell me.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.491
I am so sorry, Boyd.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.661
I messed up.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.047
You have no idea what you've done.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.224
Boyd, I'm so sorry.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.809
I...

38:32.852 --> 38:36.355
I had her in my car.
And we stopped at the gas station.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.400
And I went into the bathroom
to check my gun,

38:39.526 --> 38:42.152
I came out, and she vanished.

38:42.237 --> 38:45.823
I have been trying everything I can
to make this right.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.412
When I thought that the sheriff's department
picked her up, I went down to Shelby

38:51.496 --> 38:53.414
and I asked for his help, but she vanished.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.666
- What did you say?
- She's just gone, Boyd.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.252
No, about Shelby. What did you just say?

38:58.670 --> 38:59.920
I went to him and his deputies.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.756
We looked up the records,
but there's nothing on her.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.384
Shelby knew that Ellen May was alive?

39:05.510 --> 39:07.011
- Yes. Him.
- Sheriff Shelby?

39:07.095 --> 39:09.346
My Sheriff Shelby knew that
you were looking for Ellen May?

39:09.431 --> 39:11.515
Yes. Him, his deputies, all of them.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.600
I went to his house!

39:19.941 --> 39:21.525
Get him out of my sight.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.033
Hey! Let's go.

39:41.588 --> 39:43.547
I've seen my share of addiction...

39:44.090 --> 39:46.800
You know all those poor souls
who came to see Billy,

39:46.926 --> 39:48.719
just looking for salvation.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.140
You had empathy for that man.

39:54.601 --> 39:55.809
You held back.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.064
When I take him down, his eyes will be clear.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.070
Listen, you see those men around again,

40:07.238 --> 40:08.739
you give me a call, all right?

40:11.242 --> 40:13.660
Been a while since someone showed
a little kindness.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.001
Got to go.

40:22.295 --> 40:25.089
- No, I'm not leaving you!
- It's just a precaution.

40:25.507 --> 40:28.008
Now, you know Shelby's been angling
to get out from underneath us.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.260
- No, Boyd.
- I'm gonna see you soon.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.596
I'm just gonna have
a conversation with the man

40:32.680 --> 40:34.139
and see what it is he knows.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.433
- We're in this together.
- We are.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.685
But Delroy is on you.

40:41.689 --> 40:42.773
Go.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.527
Okay.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.697
I should have killed her myself.

40:50.824 --> 40:53.283
Well, it may come to that yet. Go.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.913
Shelby?

41:41.666 --> 41:43.000
Hello, Boyd.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.919
- Not him.
- I am unarmed.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.422
I'm just a civilian on an evening stroll.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.766
Drew goddamn Thompson.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.737
- Why the hell didn't you run?
- Where am I gonna go...

42:11.863 --> 42:13.947
Run through the woods in prison orange?

42:14.032 --> 42:17.201
I couldn't even take a crap without dumping
on some LEO out looking for me.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.368
That ain't no kind of life.

42:18.453 --> 42:21.121
Well, that's an evolved perspective.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.416
Since I didn't run, I don't suppose
any part of that offer is still available?

42:24.626 --> 42:26.126
In the car, on the way up,

42:27.253 --> 42:29.087
you were telling Shelby you'd never talk.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.215
Like I said, that's who we are.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.717
There ain't no deal any more, Hunter.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.803
I'm sorry.
That ship sailed with Drew Thompson.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.765
For all it's worth, I'm sorry about your daddy.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.141
Don't be.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.810
We had a nice visit before he passed.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.562
- Did you?
- He told me that he loved me

42:45.647 --> 42:48.232
and that he thought I was a good boy,

42:48.316 --> 42:50.400
said he was sorry
for all the times he was a dick.

42:50.610 --> 42:53.654
He was gonna miss seeing me grow up,
but he'd be watching over me every day.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.073
- Sounds like Arlo, all right.
- What can I say?

42:56.491 --> 42:58.158
The man never let me down.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.160
Raylan.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.999
You listen to what your mama taught you
and not that old son of a bitch,

43:06.084 --> 43:08.252
you may turn out all right.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.836
But I wouldn't count on it.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.506
'Cause I think we both know
whose voice it is

43:12.590 --> 43:14.675
makes you do what you do.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.141
Let's go find Drew Thompson.
