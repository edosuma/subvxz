<i>to wrinkle stippling,</i>

03:49.277 --> 03:50.245
<i>which is one of my favorite

04:56.778 --> 04:57.780
And you will leave,

04:58.613 --> 04:59.614

05:02.651 --> 05:03.718
Who the hell are you?

05:06.120 --> 05:09.224
Do you understand and agree
to these things, Mr. Schaund?

05:14.963 --> 05:15.965
Are you a lawyer?

05:29.911 --> 05:32.615
I know what
you do to her, Mr. Schaund,

05:33.915 --> 05:36.686

if she leaves.

<i>Okay, I can't talk right now.
You'll have to call back.</i>

07:09.444 --> 07:10.913
No, no, this can't wait.

07:11.312 --> 07:13.314

07:21.088 --> 07:23.892

08:15.209 --> 08:16.211
So, I just...

08:17.379 --> 08:19.245
I just tell people he left me?

08:19.247 --> 08:21.783
Mm-hm. For another woman.

08:23.317 --> 08:24.486
No one will question it.

08:29.423 --> 08:31.060
Keep going to Group, it'll help.

08:31.992 --> 08:33.995
You can be honest
about everything except me.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.932
Can I pass on your details?

08:38.133 --> 08:39.134
If someone really needs it.

08:40.969 --> 08:43.806
I can't promise to come in time,
not yet at least.

08:48.610 --> 08:49.812
Thank you.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.312
And do you have my note?

08:52.080 --> 08:52.948
Oh. Uh...

08:55.517 --> 08:57.386
If my number changes,
I'll let you know.

08:59.553 --> 09:00.555

Never Truly Lost,

10:04.552 --> 10:08.591
<i>just geographically,
temporarily dislocated.</i>

13:05.600 --> 13:07.599
Well, I met him at 16 years old.

13:07.601 --> 13:10.773
I had a daughter
at the age of 17.

13:11.306 --> 13:13.776
I moved in with him,
at his mother's house.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.245
Everything was fine
until like a year later,

13:17.479 --> 13:18.680
I started getting punched.

13:19.114 --> 13:20.278
I left it alone,

13:20.280 --> 13:22.183
never walked away,
never called the cops.

13:23.283 --> 13:26.151
It started getting... He started
getting used to abusing of me,

13:26.153 --> 13:29.490
because he saw I wasn't calling
no one for help or anything.

13:30.557 --> 13:32.660
I left it alone because
I was young and in love,

13:33.695 --> 13:35.564
until not too long ago.

13:36.697 --> 13:37.799
My son was three...

13:43.804 --> 13:46.174
I was at home working,
it was a Sunday.

13:46.573 --> 13:50.309
I got home,
and my son ran to me crying,

13:50.311 --> 13:51.613
telling me his father beat him.

13:52.279 --> 13:55.783
When I checked the baby,
he had marks all over his body,

13:56.850 --> 13:59.455
from a USB plug
that he abused of him.

14:01.355 --> 14:05.193
I went to confront him about it,
he didn't say anything about it.

14:05.493 --> 14:06.595
I called 911.

14:08.863 --> 14:11.400
That was the first time
I ever called the cops on him.

14:12.167 --> 14:13.799
I never called them
when he abused of me,

14:13.801 --> 14:16.738
but once it got to my kids,
I wasn't gonna let it happen.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.610
Which they sent me into a
domestic violence shelter...

14:37.892 --> 14:39.658
Even though I went
into the shelter,

14:39.660 --> 14:41.629
I was still planning
on going back to him.

14:42.529 --> 14:45.598
Because I was 16 when
I first met him, so it was like,

14:45.600 --> 14:46.902
that's all I knew, was him.

14:48.669 --> 14:50.902
So, I started meeting new people
in the shelter,

14:50.904 --> 14:52.406
going into counseling groups,

14:53.341 --> 14:55.310
just let me hearing
other people's stories,

14:55.777 --> 14:57.743
and I felt like I had support

14:57.745 --> 14:59.548
by other people
once I got in there.

15:00.782 --> 15:03.782
And to this day,
I choose not to go.

15:03.784 --> 15:06.554

17:01.903 --> 17:05.539

17:14.348 --> 17:15.884
<i>I'll give you more abalone."</i>

17:17.518 --> 17:20.821
<i>But if you follow her,
you will never come back.</i>

18:34.028 --> 18:36.964
<i>It can
be so very hard to accept</i>

18:37.198 --> 18:38.998
that someone so close to you,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.736
someone who's supposed
to love you,

18:41.501 --> 18:43.504
can brutalize and control you.

18:44.806 --> 18:50.379
That brutality, that control
starts to breed worthlessness,

18:50.978 --> 18:53.981
<i>and that feeling
that you can't do any better.</i>

18:56.616 --> 18:58.986
<i>And sometimes, we do.
We get that feeling that...</i>

18:59.987 --> 19:01.022
<i>We can go.</i>

19:02.256 --> 19:04.593
<i>We gotta get up outta there.
If we wanna go, we can go!</i>

19:06.059 --> 19:07.495
<i>And then we get scared.</i>

19:08.162 --> 19:10.899
Start to feel
like there's no escape.

19:13.534 --> 19:17.072
You're confused and not know
what's real and what's not real.

19:18.638 --> 19:20.940
And there's something,
there's something inside of us,

19:20.942 --> 19:22.810
something that we know
is down there,

19:23.644 --> 19:25.646
and we recognize it, we all do.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.984
That's how we got here.
We recognize that we have value.

19:31.786 --> 19:34.186
And we reached up
and we reached out

19:34.188 --> 19:35.490
and we got some help.

19:36.557 --> 19:38.926
And we grabbed that freedom
and got outta there.

19:40.260 --> 19:41.529
That's what's real.

19:42.896 --> 19:43.898
That's real.

Somewhere warm.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.096

23:09.135 --> 23:11.772
It's like all his hate makes
his love worth it.

23:15.409 --> 23:17.712
Because we really had
to fight for it.

23:19.713 --> 23:22.282
This is one fight it's okay
to give up on.

23:47.907 --> 23:49.141
Well, wherever you go,

23:49.143 --> 23:50.444
you better find
a new support group.

Yeah.

37:21.121 --> 37:22.623
It might be a little scary.

37:23.123 --> 37:25.023

Okay.

38:32.925 --> 38:34.628

but he really loves me,

but it's good.

39:54.139 --> 39:56.409
I have control over me
and my kids now.

39:58.844 --> 39:59.846
It's my will.

40:01.014 --> 40:01.815
Not his.

40:10.724 --> 40:12.159
What makes you say that, Sadie?

40:18.297 --> 40:19.432
'Cause it's true.

40:23.436 --> 40:25.439
Can you share your leaving story
with us?

40:38.418 --> 40:40.186
We went on camping trips a lot.

40:41.054 --> 40:42.056
Who's "We"?

40:43.822 --> 40:46.092
Me, my husband and our son,
Cody.

40:47.893 --> 40:49.028
What were the trips like?

40:51.164 --> 40:52.932
Survivalist camping. It's...

40:54.333 --> 40:56.803
We'd trek into the woods,
build our own shelter,

40:57.003 --> 40:59.405
hunt and forage for food,
do our own first aid.

41:00.039 --> 41:01.041
He would...

41:02.208 --> 41:03.210
set my bones.

41:04.811 --> 41:06.113
After he broke them.

41:08.313 --> 41:09.482
When I broke the rules.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.485
He never did it
in front of Cody, though.

41:15.487 --> 41:16.987
He never hurt me
in front of him.

41:16.989 --> 41:19.025
And I always used makeup
to cover anything.

41:20.059 --> 41:21.161
And we protected him.

41:23.028 --> 41:24.829
Did you tell anyone?

41:24.831 --> 41:27.166
Your friends, family,
about the abuse?

41:29.268 --> 41:30.269
No, I...

41:31.371 --> 41:33.237
When we got married,
we moved away from my parents,

41:33.239 --> 41:35.373
across the country.
And I was glad. I...

41:38.844 --> 41:40.213
I don't have any friends.

41:43.416 --> 41:44.581
If I wanted to socialize,

41:44.583 --> 41:46.550
the money came out
of Cody's food budget,

41:46.552 --> 41:47.954
so I just didn't go out.

41:51.257 --> 41:52.860
And I wasn't allowed to work.

41:53.827 --> 41:56.230
Because that's a husband's role.

41:59.097 --> 42:00.433
I was a very good wife.

42:02.202 --> 42:03.837
How long were you with him?

42:06.539 --> 42:07.775
About ten years.

42:10.175 --> 42:11.277
What made you leave?

42:21.286 --> 42:22.388
He came home early.

42:24.990 --> 42:26.893
Right after Cody got home
from school.

42:27.092 --> 42:29.495
He was excited.

42:31.563 --> 42:33.430
There was a new truck
in the driveway,

42:33.432 --> 42:35.869
hooked up to our
camping trailer, and he was...

42:37.637 --> 42:39.039
saying we were leaving.

42:39.505 --> 42:41.171
We were gonna go
live off the grid,

42:41.173 --> 42:42.242
like we always wanted.

42:44.978 --> 42:46.512
He was more than excited,
he was...

42:47.579 --> 42:48.581
manic.

42:50.048 --> 42:51.384
Told me to go start packing.

42:52.652 --> 42:53.920
Just the essentials.

42:54.621 --> 42:55.923
"Now."

42:58.190 --> 42:59.225
What did you do?

43:03.663 --> 43:04.931
I panicked.

43:09.635 --> 43:11.871
I went into Cody's room
and I said

43:12.204 --> 43:15.375
that I needed to sneak out
to go get Dad a special present.

43:17.610 --> 43:19.213
And would
he come with me?

43:25.184 --> 43:27.120
He thought it
was a special mission.

43:33.659 --> 43:35.992
We snuck out
through the kitchen,

43:35.994 --> 43:37.197
through the laundry room.

43:38.231 --> 43:39.466
And then out the back.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.103
And we were almost
at the freeway.

43:46.239 --> 43:47.240
And he...

43:48.373 --> 43:51.177
cut us off,
and knocked me down,

43:51.411 --> 43:52.378
and...

43:53.679 --> 43:55.114
He had a knife on him.

43:55.581 --> 43:58.050
And he just started slashing me
with it.

43:58.518 --> 43:59.619
Slashing me with it.

44:02.956 --> 44:05.025
And then Cody started screaming.

44:08.527 --> 44:09.929
And he got up off me...

44:15.434 --> 44:17.371
And then my boy
stopped screaming.

44:43.161 --> 44:44.163
Can't change that.

44:54.306 --> 44:56.042
You could hear
the trucks there, too.

45:04.050 --> 45:05.218
Thank you, Sadie.

45:11.190 --> 45:15.429
If it's okay with you, I would
like to end this session by...

45:16.461 --> 45:18.532
by taking a moment
of silence for Janet.

46:09.648 --> 46:12.085
<i>All the women that died,
wanting out?</i>

46:13.186 --> 46:15.188
<i>Men who died, wanting out?</i>

46:16.188 --> 46:17.190
<i>Girls...</i>

46:18.324 --> 46:19.326
<i>Boys...</i>

46:21.427 --> 46:24.131
Every graveyard is full...

46:25.364 --> 46:26.666
of people that didn't make it.

46:27.833 --> 46:29.769
And you sit here, alive,

46:30.603 --> 46:32.606
and wasting.

46:36.108 --> 46:37.277
It's disrespectful to them.

46:37.543 --> 46:39.543
To the ones
that are gonna die today,

46:39.545 --> 46:40.813
and gonna die tomorrow.

46:44.349 --> 46:45.351
It's a massacre.

46:46.485 --> 46:49.121
And all you can do is sit here
and read kids' books.

46:51.423 --> 46:52.592
You have to fight back.

46:53.693 --> 46:54.694
Even if...

46:56.128 --> 46:57.297
Even if it kills you.

47:40.606 --> 47:42.242
Is the bank still foreclosing?

47:43.476 --> 47:44.577
Sale's in two weeks.

47:45.277 --> 47:46.744
You need to go in and get out

47:46.746 --> 47:48.248
any possessions you want
before then.

47:49.548 --> 47:50.548
Good news is,

47:50.550 --> 47:52.486
credit card companies
are reviewing your debt.

47:53.753 --> 47:57.289
I'm fairly confident it'll all
get written off as fraud.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.892
Do you know what he was buying?

48:02.894 --> 48:04.630
Mainly supplementing
mortgage payments.

48:05.364 --> 48:06.500
Until they cut him off.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.402
And the life insurance policy?

48:11.336 --> 48:14.240
Because your husband's missing,
not confirmed dead...

48:16.409 --> 48:17.510
they won't pay out.

48:22.215 --> 48:23.216
Hmm.

48:28.387 --> 48:29.655
What's my best option?

48:31.289 --> 48:33.389
From the state, I can get you
an immediate payment

48:33.391 --> 48:34.493
of two-and-a-half grand.

48:35.728 --> 48:37.496
That's the cost
of your son's funeral.

54:56.775 --> 54:58.110
<i>Dear Miss Beverly,</i>

54:58.710 --> 55:00.846
<i>please destroy this letter
after you read it.</i>

55:02.347 --> 55:04.317
<i>I know what I wanna do
with my life.</i>

55:06.150 --> 55:08.820
<i>I wanna use it to help people
who can't escape.</i>

55:10.856 --> 55:11.858
<i>I won't kill.</i>

55:12.925 --> 55:14.661
<i>But I'll get them free
from the abuse quickly.</i>

55:15.094 --> 55:15.894
<i>And for good.</i>

55:17.896 --> 55:20.199
<i>Let me fight,
so they don't have to.</i>

55:21.867 --> 55:23.800
<i>I'll ask for cash or food
in return,</i>

55:23.802 --> 55:24.938
<i>whatever they can afford.</i>

55:26.137 --> 55:27.906
<i>One day I hope
not to ask for anything.</i>

55:30.242 --> 55:32.041
<i>I'll be out of contact
most of the time,</i>

55:32.043 --> 55:33.612
<i>but it won't
be forever, either.</i>

55:35.114 --> 55:37.215
<i>Instructions are at the bottom
of the page.</i>

55:38.217 --> 55:40.349
<i>I know it's a risk
to pass them on and I...</i>

55:40.351 --> 55:41.954
<i>I don't expect you to take it.</i>

55:44.356 --> 55:47.327
<i>I used to be afraid that
the trucks won't stop coming.</i>

55:48.994 --> 55:50.663
<i>But now, I welcome every one.</i>

55:53.666 --> 55:55.234
<i>Thank you for helping me.</i>

59:28.581 --> 59:30.313
I saw you in the woods,
I thought you were a hunter.

59:32.451 --> 59:35.121
I followed you for... for miles.

59:36.221 --> 59:37.923
I don't even
really know why, I just...

59:40.492 --> 59:42.894
Even when I saw you hid the car
the way we did...

59:44.463 --> 59:45.464
I wasn't sure.

59:48.500 --> 59:49.902
Until I saw your face.

59:53.204 --> 59:54.206
Saw my girl.

01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:04.950
But I don't know, Sades.

01:00:07.552 --> 01:00:08.621
You still my girl?

01:00:40.018 --> 01:00:41.887
Why'd you do that to your hair?

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.612
Hey.

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.559
You need to drink some water.

01:01:42.146 --> 01:01:43.982
That's a lot of forest
you covered, Sades.

01:01:46.318 --> 01:01:47.553
You've marked it off perfectly.

01:01:52.423 --> 01:01:53.458
You been looking for me?

01:02:07.072 --> 01:02:08.641
We gotta figure out
your head, Sades.

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:13.346
You messed it all up.

01:02:59.356 --> 01:03:01.059
So, there is still
a heart in you.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.549
You've been a bad person.

01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:27.686
But it's okay.

01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:31.557
Because I got you back now.

01:03:34.192 --> 01:03:35.360
I got you back, Sadie.

01:03:49.306 --> 01:03:50.708
I'm gonna go
get us something to eat.

01:06:25.396 --> 01:06:27.865
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

01:06:54.358 --> 01:06:55.693
Put your arm on the wood, Sades.

01:07:06.938 --> 01:07:07.940
Sadie...

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:12.043
Put your arm on the wood.

01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:40.986
Sadie!

01:17:53.583 --> 01:17:55.086
Still can't believe
you're alive.

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:21.980
You gotta come home, Sades.

01:18:30.587 --> 01:18:31.588
I love you.

01:18:49.172 --> 01:18:50.175
I can't help it.

01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:56.981
Even after all this...

01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:00.385
I still love you.

01:19:28.779 --> 01:19:30.515
I thought it was love you had.

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:35.220
But it's not.

01:19:41.859 --> 01:19:43.061
It's need.

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:47.265
Desperate...

01:19:48.265 --> 01:19:49.300
perverted...

01:19:50.266 --> 01:19:51.368
- need.
- Sadie.

01:19:52.735 --> 01:19:53.738
No.

01:19:54.805 --> 01:19:56.541
I tried to hide from it.

01:19:59.409 --> 01:20:01.179
And then I tried to run from it.

01:20:03.713 --> 01:20:04.716
And now...

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:08.286
Now I'm gonna end it.

01:20:11.588 --> 01:20:12.689
You're coming home.

01:20:17.194 --> 01:20:19.260
You killed our boy.

01:20:19.262 --> 01:20:20.364
You made me!

01:20:21.465 --> 01:20:22.667
You made me do it!

01:20:29.372 --> 01:20:32.376
You knew it'd be bad,
leaving me.

01:20:33.577 --> 01:20:34.746
And you did it anyway.

01:20:38.548 --> 01:20:40.085
You knew it'd be bad!

01:20:43.487 --> 01:20:44.489
You made me...

01:20:49.659 --> 01:20:51.863
You killed our boy...

01:20:53.329 --> 01:20:55.100
because he saw the truth of you.

01:21:02.773 --> 01:21:04.141
You killed our boy.

01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:08.213
And now, I'm gonna kill you.

01:23:57.914 --> 01:23:59.716
Glad the shelter
was able to find you.

01:24:02.086 --> 01:24:03.755
Why did the police wanna see me?

01:24:05.655 --> 01:24:08.659
The police may have found
your husband's body.

01:24:09.693 --> 01:24:11.762
And they want you to go in
and identify it.

01:24:12.996 --> 01:24:13.931
And what happened to him?

01:24:15.498 --> 01:24:18.969
Well, the man did not die
of natural causes.

01:24:20.604 --> 01:24:22.407
But there doesn't seem
to be any evidence.

01:24:23.006 --> 01:24:25.510
And considering
his felon status,

01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:28.543
I doubt they'll wanna
put more effort

01:24:28.545 --> 01:24:30.014
into solving the case.

01:24:31.414 --> 01:24:32.417
If it is him,

01:24:33.618 --> 01:24:34.450
you'll need to account for
your whereabouts and schedule

01:24:34.452 --> 01:24:36.020
during the second week
of February.

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.090
I can do that.

01:24:41.557 --> 01:24:44.028
The good news
is that with a body,

01:24:44.828 --> 01:24:46.564
his life insurance pays out.

01:24:53.537 --> 01:24:55.469
Is there some way I can keep
in contact with you?

01:24:55.471 --> 01:24:56.873
Email, telephone number?

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:00.778
Yeah, I made you
an email address.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.007
<i>I'm looking out the window,</i>

01:25:32.009 --> 01:25:34.112
<i>and the trucks
won't stop coming.</i>

01:25:35.179 --> 01:25:36.948
<i>My name is Eva Greenberg.</i>

01:25:37.914 --> 01:25:39.484
<i>I live at 402...</i>

01:26:13.722 --> 01:26:18.722
