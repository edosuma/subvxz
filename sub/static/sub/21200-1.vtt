Party!

00:21.880 --> 00:23.560
He's the only person I loved.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.160
I love this girl.
I'm gonna be with her.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.720
'By getting over
the ghosts of their pasts

00:30.800 --> 00:32.200

00:35.680 --> 00:37.160
Fuck's sake.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.560
(shouting)

00:38.640 --> 00:41.000
He better not get with anyone.
cos I'd go mad.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.760
'There'll be tantrums...'

00:42.840 --> 00:44.880
I am fucking fuming!

00:46.520 --> 00:49.160
You shagged my fucking good mate
behind my back.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.480
'...trauma...'

00:50.560 --> 00:52.880
(shouting)
Come on, then.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.640
'...and as always,
the Tablet of Terror is on hand

00:56.720 --> 00:59.160

00:59.240 --> 01:02.240
I'm sick of being like this
every singe time with you.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.720
'...and mischief.'

01:03.800 --> 01:04.920
Bye!

01:05.000 --> 01:08.560
'Love hurts, and it hurts like hell.'

01:08.640 --> 01:10.200
'Whose...'

01:10.280 --> 01:12.360
Honk, honk! (laughs)

01:12.440 --> 01:13.840

01:13.920 --> 01:15.400
Bring it on, pencil dick.

Last time, I didn't live up to
my potential, cos I was fucking ill.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.280
This time,
I'm gonna get in that villa

02:08.360 --> 02:12.040
and blast the arse
off as many birds as I fucking can.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.440
Unless I fall in love.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.360
Saying that,
I'll probably still cheat on her.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.440
'Charming as ever, Marty.'

02:19.840 --> 02:22.560

'She's a model from Aberdeen,
one half of a twin.'

02:39.640 --> 02:43.160
I'm Che. I'm so nice
that they made me twice.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.880
Ow, my tit.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.600
I'm the sexy and glamourous twin.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.080
I wanna have some fun in the sun
and meet some sexy men.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.840
I don't want a boy. I want a man
who's not that childish. (chuckles)

02:57.920 --> 02:59.480
'Yeah, good luck with that.'

03:01.680 --> 03:03.600
Ooh.
I'm looking down the beach.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.200
Hi.
I'm happy with her.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.400
Aye-aye, babes.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.800
Oh, my God, it's Marty. We're gonna
have a lot of fun together.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.360
I think I fucking love you
already. I think I've found Mrs Mac.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.360
I don't want anyone else to come.
I think we'd get on, just us two.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.080
'Sorry to spoil your fun, guys,

03:21.160 --> 03:24.240
but this next chunk of hunk
is about to wash up.'

03:26.400 --> 03:28.520
I'm Jordan Wright and I fire fight.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.680
Who wouldn't wanna be rescued by me?

03:31.760 --> 03:33.600
Birds love the uniform.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.600
One of my favourite things to ask
is,

03:35.680 --> 03:38.600
"Fancy slipping down my pole?"
'Ugh, easy, tiger.'

03:38.680 --> 03:40.280
(laughs)

03:43.720 --> 03:46.320
I can see someone else
walking in red shorts,

03:46.400 --> 03:49.360
and he looks like a big, fat
fucking divvy, to be honest.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.880
Che, yeah?
Che.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.400
Che.
Che.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.520
I'd definitely go there.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.080
What do you do?
A fireman.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.080
(laughs) What do you do, Marty?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.320
He's beaten me here.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.200
Why would the girl want spam...

04:04.280 --> 04:06.360
...when she can have
a sirloin steak?

04:07.960 --> 04:11.320
'Next to arrive
is VIP hostess Nicole.'

04:11.400 --> 04:15.880
'This brunette Brummie babe is here
to find deep and meaningful love.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.120
My best asset is...
probably my heart.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.760
I feel like
I'm really stuck on my ex.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.240
I find it so hard
to be with someone new.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.760
But I really want a husband,
cos I got a lot of love to give.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.960
Show us how you flirt.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.920
I'm walking down the beach and I see
this massive guy in red shorts

04:40.000 --> 04:41.560
Hey, darling. How you doing?

04:41.640 --> 04:43.720
Do I recognise you?
You from Essex?No.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.480
No?
Birmingham.Birmingham?

04:45.560 --> 04:47.120
He was on me. I was like, ugh!

04:47.200 --> 04:50.080
We could have a wicked foursome
if you think about it.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.600
I'm not...

04:52.680 --> 04:54.200
Do you not share?

04:55.200 --> 04:56.200
What the fuck?

04:56.280 --> 04:59.040
'You might be in shock now, Nicole,

04:59.120 --> 05:00.640
but as this is Ex on the Beach,

05:00.720 --> 05:02.520
there'll be more trauma to come

05:02.600 --> 05:07.240
when your scorned lovers
get washed up, one by one.'

05:07.320 --> 05:09.280
(evil laugh)

05:11.600 --> 05:15.120
'Next to join the search for love
is this fine specimen

05:15.200 --> 05:17.960
of Yorkshire beef. Meet Max.'

05:20.520 --> 05:23.640
I'm Britain's best-looking builder.
Pow.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.800
Lean, mean shagging machine.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.920
(laughs)

05:31.000 --> 05:33.400
There's two types of birds now
in the world.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.200
There's the club-goers
and then the nice girls.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.960
There's nothing in between.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.520
If that girl exists,
I'll whack a ring straight on it.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.720
'Oh, you're gonna find your wife
on the Beach of Doom.'

05:46.800 --> 05:49.760
Instantly, I see a blonde girl.
Hiya.How are you?

05:49.840 --> 05:52.760
Big titties, looks like
she could breastfeed a creche.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.040
That is a bit of me.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.720
(laughs)

05:58.760 --> 06:03.760
Max is dreamy. I don't wanna bang
someone on the first night,

06:03.840 --> 06:06.280
but knowing me, I fucking will.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.600
(both) What's your type?
Usually blonde.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.560
I love how none of yous...

06:12.640 --> 06:15.000
Hey, baby.
Do you know what?

06:15.080 --> 06:17.080
Yous look like Barbie and Ken.
Yeah.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.000
Who wouldn't wanna be
Barbie and Ken?

06:22.080 --> 06:25.080
'Time for sexy single number six,

06:25.160 --> 06:27.360
Latina goddess Fatima,

06:27.440 --> 06:30.640
an Ibizan babe knows how to party.'

06:33.280 --> 06:34.960
I love to go out raving.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.480
But I can pull off
a classy look as well.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.600
I love blond guys with big dicks.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.200
And I always get what I want.
Always.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.080
'Watch out, Marty.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.240
Look down the beach, I'm buzzing.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.800
Fucking my type.
'She's got you already.'

06:53.880 --> 06:56.200
What's your name?
You can call me Fati.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.480
Nice to meet you.
You're not very fat.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.120
(they laugh)

07:00.200 --> 07:02.720
Which one out of the three
is your favourite?

07:02.800 --> 07:05.240
All three look quite decent.
(Max)Come on!

07:05.320 --> 07:07.240
(shouting, laughter)

07:07.320 --> 07:10.160
At the moment, I fancy Max,
Marty and Jordan.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.320
She's on the fence.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.360
You're the type of bird that would
sleep with my fella and not tell me.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.240
'That's a bit quick to judge,
Nicole.'

07:18.320 --> 07:21.200
'Maybe you'll feel warmer
about the next beach babe.'

07:24.480 --> 07:26.400
I'm Savannah from Yorkshire.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.960
My mum's always tried to bring me up
to speak properly,

07:30.040 --> 07:31.400
all that type of thing,

07:31.480 --> 07:34.760
but I'm the girl that literally
shit in a crate at Leeds Fest.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.400
If there's someone I proper fancy,

07:38.480 --> 07:40.760
I just try my best to be ladylike.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.720
Obviously, they'd realise
that I was a fuckwit.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.720
(indistinct chatter)

07:49.800 --> 07:53.440
All I could see were
these big "fuck off" white teeth.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.400
Shit, she's been to the dentist.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.280
I can do my hair in your teeth.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.040
Savannah, she is a absolute rocket.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.680
Jordan, jog on.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.920
'The last single
to join the search for romance

08:09.000 --> 08:11.400

08:15.880 --> 08:19.000
I'm Dean. I'm an electrician,
and I'm from Kent.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.280
I'm not very educated,
but I do speak two languages.

08:22.360 --> 08:26.920
I can speak English and, erm...
the language of love.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.000
I wouldn't say I've got it all...
but I've nearly got it all.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.440
(laughs)

08:43.480 --> 08:45.200
I've got a rose for the lady.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.080
Oh, my God!

08:48.160 --> 08:49.640
He's fit as fuck.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.040
Walking in with that rose. Fuck me,
could you get any more cheesier?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.560
I'm Dean.
I'm Savannah.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.320
This tanned, muscly, massive babe...
I'm Dean.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.360
...is a bit of me.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.240
Got a rose for the lucky lady.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.880
Aw, thank you.
You're welcome.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.400
Dean gives me that rose,

09:09.480 --> 09:12.960
the girls look like they pulled
them coconuts out of their arses.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.560
They are so jealous.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.680
Let's have a big salute.
(they cheer)

09:16.760 --> 09:18.960
'It's all fun and games now, guys,

09:19.040 --> 09:20.640
but how long can it last?'

09:20.720 --> 09:24.000
'One of your exes
is already on their way.'

09:24.080 --> 09:26.640
(evil laugh)

09:26.720 --> 09:28.960
Does anybody have, like,
a really bad ex?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.320
I had an ex for four years.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.880
If he went to the loo,
I'd be like, "Where are you going?"

09:36.000 --> 09:37.640
That's loco.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.160
I'm not gonna get disrespected.

09:40.240 --> 09:44.160
Nor is my ex gonna go near
another bird. It's not gonna happen.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.960
You never know.
(men shout, laugh)

09:49.120 --> 09:50.680
No. No.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.640
I feel so strongly about my ex.
Like, it's not happening.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.360
Over my dead body.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.920
You would get with my ex?
I haven't see your ex.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.640
I don't know what he looks like,
but I'm here to meet guys.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.720
He won't go for her.
She's got no arse.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.440
I think she's just
a lonely little bitch

10:08.520 --> 10:10.560
that likes to get on everyone's exes.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.960
Honestly, what a rude bitch.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.680
Shut up!
Oh!

10:16.760 --> 10:20.480
If you don't shut up, I'm gonna
knock you out with my tits. Boom!

10:20.560 --> 10:23.440
You don't know what...
Shut your mouth for a sec. Shh.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.200
Coconut, anyone?

10:25.280 --> 10:28.840
It's not looking good.
Normally, beaches are a lovely place.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.480
There's a storm brewing,
and the sand's black.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.400
'It is the Beach of Doom, Dean.'

10:35.480 --> 10:36.720
(tablet chimes)

10:36.800 --> 10:39.360
'Now this bad boy
wants to make an appearance.'

10:39.440 --> 10:40.800
(Nicole) I give up.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.600
"Listen up.
It's time for the first date."

10:43.680 --> 10:47.120
"Dean, if you're hungry for love,
choose a lucky lady

10:47.200 --> 10:51.040
you'll take for a tasty treat."
I hope she doesn't mean his cock.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.120
(laughs)

10:52.200 --> 10:54.280
Who do you pick, fella?
Erm...

10:54.360 --> 10:57.760
Please, please don't pick
the little blonde bird.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.400
I gave you the rose,
so if you'd like to...

11:00.480 --> 11:02.160
Yeah.
...go have a tasty treat.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.840
Go on, Dean, son.
I hope I made the right choice.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.400
The one with blonde hair
is normally my sort.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.520
See you later.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.280
Dean's a really good-looking guy.
I'm fucking loving it right now.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.600
'As Dean and Savannah
head into the sunset,

11:17.680 --> 11:20.960
the rest head over
to discover their luxurious

11:21.040 --> 11:22.520
Bali love nest.'

11:22.600 --> 11:23.640
Fucking yes!

11:23.720 --> 11:26.640
Oh, my God.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.280
This villa is unreal.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.840
I feel like I've won
the fucking lottery.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.560
(they cheer)

11:39.280 --> 11:40.800
Oh, I love it.

11:45.520 --> 11:50.000
Oh, my God, what the fuck?
He's literally kissing Fatima.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.920
I'm loving this.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.720
I will shag Fatima.
The Fati. The Fat One.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.960
This is a beautiful location.
It's so romantic.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.560
I'm hoping he can be the same.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.080
Cheers to the first date.
To the first date.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.480
I'm gonna try and play it cool,
take it a bit slow.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.440
Throw a few compliments in.
Do you like a bad boy or a good boy?

12:20.520 --> 12:23.000
I like a bit of a bad boy?
You like a bad boy?

12:23.080 --> 12:26.240
Yeah. Yeah, what are you into?

12:26.320 --> 12:27.560
Er, women.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.800
Do you know what these are?

12:33.880 --> 12:36.680
I'm guessing that these
are aphrodisiacs.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.080
The banana is good practice for you.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.760
You weren't messing there, girl.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.600
Swallow.
You know you've gotta swallow.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.080
I thought I'd ease her in

12:51.160 --> 12:53.920
with a few nice, soft fruits,
be a bit of a gentleman.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.040
Now, look, watch.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.960
It you lick that, that's the best
aphrodisiac you'll ever get.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.400
Shit, right, OK.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.840
All of it, though.
It went up my nose.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.960
Don't worry about it.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.680
You feeling horny?

13:08.760 --> 13:10.760
No, I don't think it's working.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.240
There's some chemistry. I've got
to keep the bait on the hook.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.720
This is what happens
when you have thrush.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.680
'Hmm, that's an interesting way
to reel him in.'

13:24.040 --> 13:27.520
Sorry to tell you, but you've
gotta know the full picture.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.800
I'm not being funny..

13:28.880 --> 13:30.320
So...
Hold up a minute.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.120
If I took them shorts off, and you
look like that, I'm out of here.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.240
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Ain't getting hard after this.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.640
'The date's not going great.
Things will be better at the villa.'

13:45.800 --> 13:47.360
'Maybe not with that face.'

13:47.440 --> 13:49.360
She's trying to make conversation.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.800
Bitch, do you not remember
what happened?

13:51.880 --> 13:55.520
Listen, don't try and threaten me
that you're gonna get with my ex.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.120
I'm telling you, you won't, OK?
You're not gonna get with my ex.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.280
Oh, man, shit.

14:01.360 --> 14:05.320
There's no need for that drama.
You got here ten minutes ago.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.920
In five minutes, they kick off
again about the exact same issue.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.600
Girls, calm yourselves down.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.560
It's your own problem.
Get on with it. (groans)

14:13.640 --> 14:16.360
I'll do whatever I want.
I maybe now I want...

14:16.440 --> 14:18.000
He's not gonna go near you.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.800
I wanna do it just to piss you off.
He's not gonna.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.720
I wish these girls would get a grip.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.600
Exes haven't turned up.
They're punching each other

14:25.680 --> 14:27.880
over exes that they could bang.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.560
Do you think I'm threatened by you?
I'm here, you're there.

14:31.640 --> 14:35.520
This fucking wally. Who the fuck
does she think she is?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.600
Honestly, you're laughable.
You're so irrelevant.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.000
You're so irrelevant.
Shut your mouth.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.080
Why are you trying to bug me?

14:43.160 --> 14:46.160
(shouting)
Please get the fuck away from me.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.000
Go away.
Why are you bothered?

14:48.080 --> 14:52.520
You're trying to bug me like a
fucking annoying mosquito. Fuck off!

14:55.760 --> 14:57.080
Look at you.
Look at me?!

14:57.160 --> 14:59.200
Look at you! Look at you!
Look at you!

14:59.280 --> 15:01.800
You're boring!
(indistinct shouting)

15:01.880 --> 15:04.760
You fucking wouldn't take my grandad,
you dickhead.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.200
Embarrassing yourself.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.160
This girl is fucking loco.
I'm staying well away from her.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.080
Get her away from me.
I need the toilet.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.440
Just let her have a shit
and let everything calm down.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.320
'Nicole needs the loo,

15:19.400 --> 15:22.520
but who will lose control
of all their bodily functions

15:22.600 --> 15:24.520
when the first ex arrives?'

15:24.600 --> 15:27.880
'T minus 12 hours.'

15:29.960 --> 15:32.560
'With Dean and Savannah
back from their date...'

15:32.640 --> 15:34.960
This is the pool.
Look at those little two.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.720
'Savannah's getting her own
tour of the villa.'

15:37.800 --> 15:39.880
Was the date good?
Do you like the girl?

15:43.240 --> 15:45.960
Dean's just come back
and I can tell by his face

15:46.040 --> 15:49.520
he already regrets
ever getting with Savannah.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.880
There's a pot of porridge.
It's either yoghurt or porridge.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.520
Anyway, it looked like...

15:54.600 --> 15:57.560
It's like Oliver Twist's breakfast.
It was ropy.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.680
And she's like,
"This is like thrush."

16:02.080 --> 16:03.400
Really?

16:03.480 --> 16:06.040
But do you know what?
We had a laugh.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.080
But the porridge thing was like...
The thrush thing.

16:09.160 --> 16:13.280
The situation with me and Savannah,
she's quite hard to read,

16:13.360 --> 16:15.800
if I'm honest,
so I'm moving on from that one.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.640
There's one bird we're going for.
We know who it is.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.760
Listen, I'm gonna be honest.
Blonde?

16:20.840 --> 16:23.040
I'm moving on to blondie.
(laughs)

16:23.120 --> 16:24.440
Sorry, but exactly.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.760
Che is by far the biggest sort
in the villa.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.680
All the boys have their eyes on her.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.320
But I'm the top dog.
I don't like to lose.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.560
We'll speak in the morning

16:33.640 --> 16:35.840
and see what's happened.
Fair play.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.080
I love competition,
and I don't lose.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.800
I'm the coolest, the slickest,
and I've got the chat.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.400
Oh, there she is.
Hello.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.000
So, it's the three amigos.
The three amigos.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.640
Looks like he's taken. He's
officially taken, so it is us three.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.200
'It's the end of the night, and
everyone appears to be civil.'

16:59.280 --> 17:02.000
'What could possibly go wrong?'
(tablet chimes)

17:02.080 --> 17:04.760
Oh, shit!
(groaning)

17:04.839 --> 17:07.119
Tablet of Terror,
what the fuck do you want?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.839
Max, choose someone
to take to the penthouse.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.599
Yeah! Fucking buzzing.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.760
Oi, oi!

17:14.839 --> 17:16.440
I'm gonna take centre stage.

17:17.480 --> 17:21.119
I think that me and the Tablet of
Terror might be very good friends.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.000
Got the hots for Max,
and it's obviously gonna be me.

17:25.079 --> 17:29.760
Deano, fuck you. Jordan, fuck you.
Cos I'm winning the race tonight.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.600
Oh! (laughs)

17:31.680 --> 17:34.040
Get the fuck here. Let's go.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.680
Tablet of Terror,
you slippery little bastard.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.560
See you later, motherfuckers.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.920
He just fucked my plan. Nightmare.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.560
Roses are red, violets are blue.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.400
I'm gonna finger you. (laughs)

17:50.480 --> 17:53.080
'Ah, that's not the rhyme
I remember.'

17:55.080 --> 17:56.720
'It's a good night for some.'

18:00.720 --> 18:02.280
'Not so much for these two.'

18:02.360 --> 18:04.520
"#losers."

18:05.520 --> 18:06.960
Fati, my missus.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.800
Fati is a good kisser.
She's gonna be a good bang.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.280
I think I love you.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.040
Drawn us in.
Next thing you know,

18:15.120 --> 18:17.040
walking down the aisle.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.000
You should get a job doing this.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.080
Really?
Yeah.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.200
What?

18:26.800 --> 18:28.200
Nah?

18:28.280 --> 18:30.080
Marty's someone to have fun with.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.200
He's there to be used and abused.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.120
So, last night I got in a row
with Fatima.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.240
She's like a nit
that doesn't leave me alone.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.000
Today I'm gonna take
the moral high ground.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.560
I'm gonna be cool, fresh.
I've had a nice sleep.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.480
It's not happening.
She's not getting another row.

19:05.320 --> 19:06.560
I woke up with Marty.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.240
He was my butler for the night.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.440
Did he give you a massage?
Yeah.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.360
I made him give me a massage.
Marty the masseuse.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.760
Masseur Martin, eh?
(laughs)

19:18.840 --> 19:22.920
I like Marty. He's sexy, attractive.
He's a frontrunner for me.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.720
Tonight, foot massage, yeah?
No, man.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.200
That's next level shit,
a foot massage.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.480
I can't touch her fanny, but she
wants us to massage her feet.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.040
I don't think I've been lying
with a bird

19:34.120 --> 19:37.280
and she hasn't touched my rod.
I was devastated.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.280
So, last night,
I'm absolutely buzzing,

19:43.360 --> 19:45.040
but she didn't put out.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.440
My balls are like two coconuts.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.240
Max, he's so cute.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.760
He's, like, not...
He's not full of himself.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.480
That's why I don't want to fuck it
and shag him on the first night.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.560
I'd like to get to know him better.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.120
Here they come, look.
(Marty) Shag or no?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.360
I was pitching tents all night.
(they cheer)

20:17.440 --> 20:20.520
I didn't bang, man.
He didn't bang me. He didn't.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.960
What's he playing at?
Schoolboy error.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.680
He had the penthouse, champagne.
I would've made the most of that.

20:31.640 --> 20:34.560
'It all looks lazy
in the villa this morning.'

20:34.640 --> 20:36.000
'Time to wake them up.'

20:36.080 --> 20:37.320
(tablet chimes)

20:38.760 --> 20:41.800
"Dean, Che and Savannah,

20:41.880 --> 20:44.840
head to the beach
to welcome your first fucking ex!"

20:44.920 --> 20:46.160
Fuck.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.840
I'm not gonna lie, I'm shitting now.
It's either one of my crazy exes

20:49.920 --> 20:52.520
or another lad. Competition.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.040
I feel fucking sick.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.760
Che, if it's your ex,
I'm gonna be pissed off.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.680
Having a mint time.
I like the girl.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.960
I don't know who it is,
who it could be.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.240
If one of my exes
come out of that water,

21:04.320 --> 21:06.560
I am fucked.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.920
'The Tablet of Terror
has shown its romantic side

21:11.000 --> 21:13.280
and sent Marty and Fati
on a massage date.'

21:13.360 --> 21:15.040
Oi, oi!
Good afternoon.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.560
'Like they haven't been
rubbing each other.'

21:17.640 --> 21:21.480
On this date, I'm going to tell
Fati everything she wants to hear,

21:21.560 --> 21:24.480
even if I'm talking complete shit.
I need to bang her.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.320
Otherwise,
I'm gonna lose my fucking head.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.640
Ah, this is amazing.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.280
This date is amazing me.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.280
Come on, then. Mount the stallion.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.960
I think, deep down,
she loves us already.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.120
I like Marty. I kind of like
the banter we have now.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.920
My plan is just go with the flow,
have fun,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.720
and we'll see what happens.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.160
Well, wait till tonight,
get a proper stiffy

21:51.240 --> 21:52.640
and see what you do with it.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.440
And what if I don't do anything?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.440
I'll wait.
Ah.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.560
But I'm ready now.
(laughs)

21:58.640 --> 22:00.120
I think you're beautiful.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.200
That's good to know, thank you.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.600
I can't wait to get back to the
villa, straight into the Pen Ken.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.320
Happy ending, like!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.080
'Marty's hoping for a happy ending,

22:15.160 --> 22:17.480
but any thoughts of fun
could end forever

22:17.560 --> 22:21.880
as the first ex is about to get
washed up on the Beach of Doom.'

22:33.120 --> 22:36.920
I don't wanna see my exes. I've got
a few crazy ones in the closet.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.480
And I hope they ain't
coming out to play.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.080
If it is your ex,
what do you think you'll do?

22:42.160 --> 22:45.360
He doesn't know
that I slept with a person,

22:45.440 --> 22:48.720
like, the day we split up,
so that's gonna fuck everything up.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.160
Fucking hell.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.600
As far as I'm aware,
he doesn't know about it.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.400
If he does,
he's gonna come out screaming at me.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.120
It's fucking shit.
I know this is gonna be my ex.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.400
I was full on in love with him.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.920
I'm getting upset.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.720
It's all right. Come on, don't cry.
No.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.480
It might not be him.
Just think positive.

23:10.560 --> 23:14.040
(echoes) It might not be him.
Just think positive.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.120
(echoes)
I know this is gonna be my ex.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.120
I was full on in love with him.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.240
Fuck. It's my ex.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.680
What's up?
Not much.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.680
What's happening? I'm Dean.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.680
Definitely ain't one of my exes.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.920
Well, so how are you?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.840
Like, I'm not even crying
cos I'm upset.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.560
I'm fucking... raging.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.360
My name's Lee. I'm a physio,
and I'm from Dublin.

23:56.440 --> 24:00.200
I have the charm of an Irishman, but
if you cross me, I'll come for you.

24:00.280 --> 24:04.600
Ex Che... Where do we start?
(laughs)

24:06.520 --> 24:10.120
When I met Che, she had a reputation
for getting with the lads.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.720
My mates came up to me,
"Lee, you can do better."

24:12.800 --> 24:16.040
Twin sister sent me a message
saying she cheated on me.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.280
What the fuck, like?
Don't know if she cheated.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.600
I broke up with her, but haven't got
the chance to speak to her.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.400
There's a few questions
that I want answers to.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.800
Busy girl the last few months, huh?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.040
Why are you here?

24:32.120 --> 24:35.560
I want to separate what I thought
you are from what you are.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.800
You and your mates
think I'm a slag.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.360
They couldn't understand why I was
with you. I was too good for you.

24:41.440 --> 24:45.640
The amount of people that say,
"Thank God you're not with her."

24:45.720 --> 24:48.640
Think I give a fuck
what you hear about me?

24:48.720 --> 24:50.560
I do not give a fuck.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.200
Go fuck yourself.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.200
Fucking loser.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.560
The amount of people
that come up to me...

24:56.640 --> 24:59.160
You fucking moron.
Did you get with his mate?

24:59.240 --> 25:00.920
Best mate, by the way.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.040
I don't feel sorry for Che. She's
played him like an Irish fiddle.

25:05.120 --> 25:08.760
Twin sister text me, saying you
cheated on me. Is that true as well?

25:10.920 --> 25:13.400
Fucked Josh
an hour after we split up.

25:18.760 --> 25:22.280
It's like I knew. It's like I knew
the whole time. It's shit.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.800
She's a slag.

25:27.800 --> 25:31.760
It's what's expected of you, Che.
You're not surprising anybody.

25:31.840 --> 25:36.160
This is so fucking awkward.
I love it.

25:36.240 --> 25:40.200
Che, you're as real as your tits.
I'm not gonna waste another second.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.200
I know you don't give a fuck.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.080
I hope you feel that,
cos I don't.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.760
Yeah.Yeah.
You don't feel anything, do you?

25:46.840 --> 25:50.320
I'm fucking happy that he knows
the truth now. He can fuck off.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.520
I'm glad it ain't one of my exes.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.480
(tablet chimes)

25:58.560 --> 26:00.840
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.960
For fuck's sake, Tablet of Terror,
you've done enough.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.320
Oh, shock(!)

26:05.400 --> 26:09.840
"It's date time. Lee and Savannah,
it's time to let it all out

26:09.920 --> 26:12.280
and make sweet music together."

26:12.360 --> 26:14.040
(laughs)
Done with Che.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.280
I don't give a fuck.
Be nice to get away

26:16.360 --> 26:18.480
and have a normal chat
with somebody.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.520
You looking forward
to seeing the new arrival?

26:31.600 --> 26:32.720
Yeah.
Yeah?Yeah.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.760
I can't wait, man.
(cheering)

26:34.840 --> 26:36.280
Oi, oi!

26:36.360 --> 26:37.800
What's the matter?

26:37.880 --> 26:40.960
He's a fucking cunt.
(Marty)Oh!

26:41.040 --> 26:44.400
Shit, Che's ex's arrived. Mint.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.600
(groans)
He came out, and he's like...

26:48.680 --> 26:50.400
I was in the middle like, "Shit!"

26:50.480 --> 26:53.920
"...I just wanted to prove that
you're not how you said you were,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.520
that you're a slag."

26:55.600 --> 26:59.000
I was like, "Whatever."
I fucking hate the boy, literally.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.240
Has he come out aggy?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.800
Yeah, he's like, "Ugh!"

27:02.880 --> 27:04.320
He sat down like...

27:05.480 --> 27:06.600
What are you saying?

27:06.680 --> 27:08.080
Huh?
What are you saying?

27:08.160 --> 27:11.440
What the fuck are you saying?
Don't whisper to each other,

27:11.520 --> 27:16.200
acting like I'm a typical
psycho bird. Say it to my face.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.120
What did you say to him?
I said he's got a point.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.640
(Max) Oh!
How has he got a point?

27:21.720 --> 27:24.520
From what I've seen of Lee,
he's a decent geezer.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.520
As far as I'm concerned, Che's
fucked up, so I'm gonna defend him.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.520
Just calm down.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.800
You said to him, "I fucked your pal
an hour after we broke up."

27:33.880 --> 27:37.400
I didn't fuck his mate.
You said that.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.320
Why did I say that?
You said, "I fucked your pal

27:40.400 --> 27:42.160
an hour after we split up."

27:42.240 --> 27:44.480
I have been with,
I have kissed his friend.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.000
Something's gone on here.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.000
She's digging a massive
hole and trying to get out of it.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.920
You said, "I fucked your pal."

27:51.000 --> 27:53.160
She fucked a pal?
She did! She did!

27:53.240 --> 27:57.160
She did say she fucked a geezer
an hour after splitting with him.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.640
I've had a few vodkas,
but I'm not lying.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.080
She said that.
All right, I said that.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.400
Babe, listen, come on.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.000
I'm not gonna lie.
I've got no reason to lie.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.520
I'm not a psycho. I don't have
a clue what you're speaking about.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.120
He's a fucking little rat.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.880
She said that. She said that.
She said that.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.960
To be fair, Dean shouldn't get
involved. It's none of his business.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.880
I also think they fancy each other
and there's a bit of sexual tension.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.880
(plays notes)

28:33.680 --> 28:36.360
I'm gonna be sharing with you
some sounds today.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.960
It's called sound therapy.
Some call it sound healing.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.040
I'm gonna need therapy
after bumping into my ex earlier.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.160
OK.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.000
Still a little bit pissed off
after the beach,

28:48.080 --> 28:51.480
so hopefully this date takes
the edge off and I can enjoy myself.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.000
This is all for the sake
of releasing.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.160
Now close your eyes.

28:57.240 --> 29:01.320
From deep inside, let the voice out,

29:01.400 --> 29:03.120
whatever it is.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.680
Start to think...

29:06.320 --> 29:10.120
...of whatever has happened you.
Che. Che. Che. Che.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.480
Is. A. Slag.

29:12.560 --> 29:15.120
Che. Don't say slag.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.360
I wanna get the anger
out of my system.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.200
Aah!

29:19.280 --> 29:21.600
Aah! (laughs)

29:21.680 --> 29:23.880
(chants)

29:23.960 --> 29:27.840
# Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya

29:27.920 --> 29:30.360
Go with the beat.
Yes. (laughs)

29:30.440 --> 29:33.120
(chants)

29:36.360 --> 29:38.560
What the fuck, man?

29:38.640 --> 29:41.680
(chanting)

29:49.280 --> 29:53.160
That actually feels good. I haven't
been with anyone since Che.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.520
Hopefully I can get with
another girl

29:55.600 --> 29:59.640
and release the other energy I've
been holding the last three months.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.480
'Lee's put Che out of his mind.'

30:04.560 --> 30:07.200
I need to use two hairdryers
cos this is so shit.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.680
'But's she's still very much
on Dean's.'

30:10.760 --> 30:14.760
And she fucked someone, his pal...
After they split up.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.800
An hour after they split up.
After they got together?

30:19.280 --> 30:20.440
(indistinct)

30:20.520 --> 30:24.960
I may have... may... may well have
got one or two minor facts wrong.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.000
But I've got the gist of the story.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.600
It looks like Che's lying.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.040
They need to hash things out
and find out what the real deal is.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.320
We'll have a chat
when he comes in here.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.920
I will happily walk away.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.720
You have a chat with him,
see if our stories match up.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.480
The truth always comes out.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.120
As soon as Lee turns up,
she's fucked.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.880
All I'm asking is,
if you're gonna come in here

30:49.960 --> 30:52.760
and repeat stuff,
using the wording I've used.

30:52.840 --> 30:57.080
Dean decides to walk in and say
that I said to my ex on the beach

30:57.160 --> 30:59.400
that I'd fucked his friends.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.160
Those were not my words,

31:01.240 --> 31:04.520
so Dean should get his words right
about what I've done.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.080
You're getting all red
cos you know I'm right.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.480
I am right.
No.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.400
You're walking away
because you know you're wrong.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.000
You're chatting shit.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.520
You're a fruitcake.
You've lost the plot.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.400
Girl's lost it, chatting bullshit.
You're a nutter.

31:18.480 --> 31:22.280
That's what girls do. They start
piping up when they've chatted shit.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.760
You're lying. You're lying. You're
lying. You're lying. You're lying.

31:26.840 --> 31:30.720
"Babe, you're a fucking fruitcake."
"Oh, you're a fucking liar."

31:30.800 --> 31:33.800
"Meh, meh, meh." No,
you're a liar. You're full of shit.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.480
He's a freak.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.360
No-one's bothered! I couldn't give
a fuck if she fucked the pope.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.560
She's saying she didn't shag him.
Dean's saying she did.

31:42.640 --> 31:45.120
Fuck knows.
I can't wait to find out the truth.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.040
Only way we can settle this is to
get Lee in here and he'll justify it.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.120
Talk of the devil.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.360
And he shall fucking appear!

31:52.440 --> 31:54.120
It's all gonna kick off.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.360
Hey! You all right, guys?

31:56.440 --> 31:59.640
(men exchange greetings)

32:01.120 --> 32:03.800
I think you and Che
should go for a conversation,

32:03.880 --> 32:05.840
just yous two, do you not think?

32:05.920 --> 32:07.480
(Lee) I don't give a fuck.

32:07.560 --> 32:11.120
I'm not interested in her.
I couldn't give a bollocks.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.960
Did she shag another geezer
just after splitting up with you?

32:15.040 --> 32:17.800
Within an hour.
Nothing shocks me with Che.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.080
Oh, shit.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.880
And everyone will get to know her,
I'm pretty sure, so...

32:26.640 --> 32:28.640
Amen... Amen.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.160
I could call this, but I'm not gonna.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.520
Call what?
Call what?

32:33.600 --> 32:34.920
I was proven right.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.920
Buzzing.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.280
Did I lie?
Stop it.Did I lie?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.760
Did I lie? Did I lie?
I'm not digging you out.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.960
Yeah, but...To be fair,
just own up to whatever you do.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.080
Who put fucking 20 pence in you?

32:49.160 --> 32:53.960
Where Max can stand
is the fuck away from me.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.960
Erm, I think there's quite a few
that owes me an apology.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.440
Do you know what now, boys?
None of you are getting this.

33:08.520 --> 33:12.400
None of you are getting anywhere
near me at any point ever.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.280
'With Che now firmly on lockdown,

33:19.360 --> 33:23.000
will the next ex have the key
to unlock her treasure?'

33:23.080 --> 33:25.800
'T minus 12 hours.'

33:30.960 --> 33:33.920
To be honest, I think Che fancies me.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.520
The fact that
I've stuck up for Lee tonight,

33:36.600 --> 33:38.840
well, ain't done me
no fucking favours.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.720
Back to Savannah it is, then.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.560
Right, me and Copa Shabana
were talking about...

33:48.160 --> 33:51.400
...erm, we were talking about
how much she likes me.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.840
Nothing's gonna happen,
so why bother?

33:55.080 --> 33:58.400
Come on,
Are you gonna give me a kiss?

33:59.760 --> 34:03.200
From the start, I've always thought
Dean is a good-looking guy.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.000
I could be tapped in the head.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.360
This could be wrong. I do have
a really shit taste in men.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.520
I'm going to bed.
Why?

34:13.600 --> 34:16.239
Cos I need to go to bed. I'm tired.
See you in a bit.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.440
Go on, good luck.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.080
I'm tired. I told you.
All right, give me a cuddle.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.800
Bed and sleep is, like,
the one thing, like, I...

34:33.000 --> 34:35.760
I'm gonna take it really slow.
I need to make sure

34:35.840 --> 34:39.520
that this guy isn't a player,
cos I've had far too many of them.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.880
Nothing's gonna happen
with Dean tonight.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.239
(laughter) 'Bad luck, Deano.'

34:45.600 --> 34:48.199
'Maybe things will go better
for Marty.'

34:48.280 --> 34:51.520
Massage oil? Shock.
He thinks we're gonna have sex.

34:53.280 --> 34:56.360
But I'm gonna make him wait
a bit more.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.520
I need to see him. Show me.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.360
Yeah,
but it's not happening tonight.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.800
(sighs)

35:05.880 --> 35:07.160
(chuckles) No.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.600
She'll think I'm a gentleman.
I am a gentleman.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.440
I am a gentleman.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.720
Not tonight.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.040
Ah! Oh, fuck!

35:21.360 --> 35:23.080
Oi. Shush.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.080
Shut the fuck up.
What're you doing?

35:25.160 --> 35:27.320
I'm trying to shut the door,

35:27.400 --> 35:30.920
because when the door's shut,
the air-con works.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.680
Savannah, boring as fuck.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.680
Che, sexy as fuck.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.080
'What're you thinking?'

35:38.160 --> 35:40.440
She can sleep in my bed.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.800
'Sneaky.'

35:41.880 --> 35:43.600
Fuck off. You're not Gaz.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.040
Jog on.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.200
'Smooth as ever, Dean. Smooth.'

36:12.080 --> 36:14.840
I'm happy to draw a line
between me and Che.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.840
I'd like to be friends,
but I don't trust the girl,

36:17.920 --> 36:21.800
and after everything,
I don't have much respect for her.

36:21.880 --> 36:26.320
I feel like, right now,
I fucking hate all the boys.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.000
So you gonna crack on with Max?

36:29.720 --> 36:32.760
Don't know.
Oh, Max has got the custard one.

36:33.960 --> 36:38.080
Yeah, Che. Who's Che?
Che? Is that the blonde girl?

36:38.160 --> 36:41.480
To be fair, yeah, Lee's come in,
said a few things about Che.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.720
Changed my mind. I'm not arsed about
spending time with her.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.200
So, I don't know
what's gonna happen there.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.000
Last night, I definitely
got a bit too drunk.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.520
And I told Che that she was lying.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.640
I thought I'd jump in bed with her,
try and soften the blow a little bit.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.120
But there's was only one thing soft
at the end of the night. That was me.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.280
I crawled out
and jumped back in with Savannah.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.040
She was none the wiser.
No harm, no foul.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.800
Do quite like Savannah,
so I'll stick at it for now.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.560
I've woken up,
and I've spent the night with Dean.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.120
We just had a cuddle and that.
Nothing went on.

37:23.200 --> 37:27.000
He's really good-looking, and his
personality's absolutely amazing.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.920
He's a genuinely really nice guy.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.520
What happened between you two
last night?

37:31.600 --> 37:33.240
You got pied again?

37:38.480 --> 37:41.680
If I don't bang Fati soon,
I'm gonna walk out of this villa

37:41.760 --> 37:45.600
with a massive pair of balls
and a diploma in masseussing.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.280
I'm starting to think it's me.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.720
I'm looking at myself thinking,
"I'm a fat, useless prick."

37:52.640 --> 37:56.720
We're all looking tanned and good,
if I can say so myself, people.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.200
Getting there.
(tablet chimes)

37:59.280 --> 38:01.200
(all) Oh!

38:02.960 --> 38:05.640
"You're all sitting
a little too comfortably."

38:05.720 --> 38:07.880
"It's time to turn up the heat."

38:07.960 --> 38:10.520
"Max, Fati and Marty..."
No!

38:10.600 --> 38:12.880
"...head to the beach
for the new arrival."

38:12.960 --> 38:14.480
Oh, shit.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.840
My arse is twitching
like a rabbit's nose.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.640
I have a lot of exes.
All of them are psychos.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.880
I really don't wanna see
any of them.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.440
I'm been grafting Fati
for the last few days.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.240
If her ex comes in,
it could fuck it all up.

38:27.320 --> 38:29.680
What are you gonna do
if it's Marty's ex?

38:29.760 --> 38:32.840
I don't take shit from people.
So...

38:32.920 --> 38:34.720
(Max) You don't take shit.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.680
Ooh, cat fight!

38:36.760 --> 38:38.480
Cat fight! Cat fight!

38:38.560 --> 38:41.040
Fatima,
I'm pretending she's not there.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.640
She's a piece of annoying furniture
that you don't wanna sit on.

38:53.120 --> 38:57.240
I don't who's gonna come out of that
water. I've shagged half the Toon.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.040
If Marty's ex comes today,
bring her on.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.480
What if my fucking mam walks out?
(they laugh)

39:06.560 --> 39:09.160
You banged your ma, like?

39:09.240 --> 39:11.960
I've been about. I've got exes.
None ended good.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.800
Drama, drama, drama
is on the way.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.720
(echoes) Drama is on the way.
I've got a few exes.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.040
None of them have ended good.

39:40.720 --> 39:41.720
Oi, oi!

39:43.800 --> 39:46.480
I see Chloe, and I can't even think
about how I feel

39:46.560 --> 39:48.560
cos of them ridiculous armbands.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
You all right?

39:50.600 --> 39:51.680
You're in trouble.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.960
Fuck, this can go really wrong.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.080
What the fuck?

39:55.160 --> 39:57.800
Cos I was swimming from Newcastle.
You're pissed.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.600
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

40:00.680 --> 40:04.120
That much of a pickle,
it's a pickled onion.
