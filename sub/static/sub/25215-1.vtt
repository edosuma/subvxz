02:35.623 --> 02:36.689
- Hey.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.725
Sweetie?

02:42.129 --> 02:44.198
Honey, are you all right?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.434
- He hurt me.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.668
- Look Tom may not be your
knight in shining armor

03:55.669 --> 03:58.237
but you could do worse.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.609
- Wow, that's a
ringing endorsement.

04:02.610 --> 04:06.679
He is more like a court
jester, and self appointed.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.416
- Look I've got to go,
but call me tonight, okay?

04:09.417 --> 04:11.183
I should get a break
around midnight.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.152
- I bet you look
great in that uniform.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.789
- I do, you know I've always
liked a man in uniform,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.791
and now I'm one of them.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.030
- You won't say a word to him?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.432
- Of course not.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.433
Never.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.571
- Fuck.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.027
I could really use a word
of advice right about now.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.262
- Helen.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.599
- Great, thanks.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.436
- Hey, what are you doing?

05:36.437 --> 05:37.437
Let's go.

05:38.407 --> 05:39.407
- What?

05:39.408 --> 05:40.488
- The Parker gig.

05:40.512 --> 05:41.641
- That's tonight?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.275
- It's now, come
on, I'll drive you.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.877
- Dad I'm really not
feeling up to it.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.413
Can't he find someone else?

05:46.414 --> 05:48.481
- Five minutes before
you're supposed to arrive?

05:48.482 --> 05:51.484
The guy just moved in,
doesn't know anyone in town.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.986
Who is he supposed to find?

05:53.987 --> 05:57.224
It was your idea to
look for more work.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.148
- Where were you?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.515
- Just in the woods.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.116
- I told you, you
shouldn't wander around

08:39.140 --> 08:40.976
out there by yourself.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.289
- I saw that man again.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.157
- Who, that old bird watcher?

08:45.158 --> 08:46.998
Lucas, you're going to
have to learn to respect

08:47.022 --> 08:48.023
your elders.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.064
You're going to look
like that when you're 80.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.033
- Do you really have
to go out tonight?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.935
- Hey where did I pack my ties?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.469
I think I left them
in the basement.

08:57.470 --> 09:01.241
Would you run down there
and grab that for me?

10:24.491 --> 10:26.559
Lucas, did you find them?

10:38.338 --> 10:41.941
- Casey is doing
pretty well at the station.

10:41.942 --> 10:45.044
I have to admit, I wasn't
sure what to expect.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.045
- Great.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.585
- You can talk to me, you know?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.588
Tell me what's going on.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.925
Is it the house?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.427
- Dad, I'm not 10.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.529
I mean that story
still creeps me out.

11:03.530 --> 11:08.500
Eating the eyes of kids to
keep himself from going blind.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.837
It's disgusting.

11:29.589 --> 11:30.990
- Thank you so much for coming,

11:30.991 --> 11:32.351
I don't know what
I would have done

11:32.375 --> 11:34.644
if your dad hadn't offered.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.697
Lucas doesn't know the
history behind this place

11:38.698 --> 11:40.900
so I would appreciate it if
we could keep that quiet.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.668
He has a pretty
active imagination.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.270
- She won't say a word.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.771
I'm going to head
back to the station,

11:45.772 --> 11:47.406
but I just wanted to
make sure everything

11:47.407 --> 11:48.506
was okay, Mr. Parker.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.242
- Awesome, thanks,
sheriff, I owe you one.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.677
- Don't mention it.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.112
- Owes you one?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.113
Christ.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.860
- I should get Lucas,
get you two acquainted.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.429
- It's just the two of you?

12:10.430 --> 12:11.764
- Yeah.

12:11.765 --> 12:16.402
Lucas' mom Linda passed
away when he was born.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.937
- Oh.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.071
I'm so sorry.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.072
I didn't mean to...

12:20.073 --> 12:22.942
- No, don't worry.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.612
She would have hated this house.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.981
Ah there he is.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.119
- Hello there.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.321
- Come down, don't be shy.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.689
- I'm Helen, nice to meet you.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.167
- Yes, the squatter,
yes I remember.

12:49.871 --> 12:50.871
The sheriff?

12:50.871 --> 12:51.871
No.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.507
Yeah, of course.

12:56.343 --> 13:00.080
I'll transfer you right
now, Mrs. Haggemeyer.

13:15.062 --> 13:18.130
Widow's Peak sheriff
office, this is Casey.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.302
♪ He'll sing you songs
and tell you lies ♪

13:23.871 --> 13:25.604
- Excuse me?

13:25.605 --> 13:29.108
- I've seen
things, heard things.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.342
- Who is this?

13:30.343 --> 13:33.145
- Tell the
sheriff Ginger called.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.814
Tell him he's awake.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.644
- Keep going!

14:05.645 --> 14:06.914
I've got it, V.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.049
I've got it, V.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.018
- You should probably
turn this off.

14:13.042 --> 14:14.743
- No, no, it's fine.

14:15.909 --> 14:17.589
- When you have terrible
nightmares tonight

14:17.590 --> 14:21.094
we'll talk about whether
or not it's fine.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.265
What's that you've got there?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.167
- It's my mom's.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.701
Was my mom's.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.172
It's supposed to
be for protection.

14:33.173 --> 14:37.110
It's silver and silver
keeps the monsters away.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.485
It's stuck.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.290
- What, Lucas?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.358
- You hear that?

14:52.359 --> 14:53.659
It's a bird in my bird house.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.660
- Your what?

14:57.830 --> 14:58.998
- It's so dark.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.708
It's a sparrow.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.146
Sparrow flies through a house,
someone is going to die.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.162
- Ginger, you're sure
that's what she said?

15:30.163 --> 15:31.397
- Yes, absolutely.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.838
- Did she say anything else?

15:39.839 --> 15:42.675
- Just that song
and "he's awake."

15:44.078 --> 15:45.078
- Thank you.

16:02.395 --> 16:06.566
- You weren't kidding about
liking this horror stuff.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.469
- Wait.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.038
Could you leave that light on?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.706
- Of course.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.387
What is it, Lucas?

16:29.856 --> 16:33.692
- I think I saw someone
around the house.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.761
In the woods.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.828
An old man.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.566
- An old man?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.270
- He's always there.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.073
Today I found a hole in
the wall in the basement.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.607
There was wind in there.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.942
What if it leads outside?

16:50.943 --> 16:52.144
What if he can come inside?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.213
What if he knows about it?

16:53.214 --> 16:54.214
- Shh, shh.

16:54.215 --> 16:56.915
No one is coming inside.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.418
- I saw him today.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.787
I think he was
going to the farm.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.790
- No, Lucas, the
farm is off limits.

17:06.159 --> 17:10.297
It's very dangerous, you should
not go there alone, okay?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.766
- When I was a kid, I
used to think children

17:14.767 --> 17:17.002
couldn't die, but they can.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.441
A lot of them died, over there.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.943
I Googled it.

17:25.811 --> 17:26.811
- Oh.

17:28.013 --> 17:31.818
You should know that that
happened a long, long time ago.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.853
You have nothing to worry about.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.223
It's time to go to bed, okay?

17:37.224 --> 17:38.224
- Okay.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.979
- Yes, sir?

18:33.980 --> 18:37.717
- I need you to
look up some files for me.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.789
- What are you doing here?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.830
- I tried to call but there's
no reception out there

19:52.854 --> 19:55.923
and I'm really
terrified of the dark.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.164
You're eating melted ice cream.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.432
That's super gross.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.001
- Nope, it's best like this.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.541
How did you know I was here?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.311
- Casey might have
told me something.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.032
I do think it's super
weird that I've got to

20:14.033 --> 20:16.113
talk to Casey to figure out
where you are these days.

20:16.137 --> 20:18.586
- Yeah, I've been working a lot.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.624
- So this is the old
Bowery place, huh?

20:25.992 --> 20:29.695
Got to admit, I expected
something a little more Gothic.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.530
Did you find any dead
bodies in the walls?

20:31.531 --> 20:32.864
- No.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.033
It's just a house,
a normal house.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.437
- Yeah, people that bought
it might be a little, right?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.507
- Nope, perfectly normal.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.676
Well...

20:44.677 --> 20:45.677
- Well?

20:46.979 --> 20:51.116
- I don't know, maybe I
don't understand boys.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.819
Did you ever trap animals
when you were a kid?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.554
- Trap animals?

20:55.555 --> 20:57.723
- Not to hurt them,
I don't think,

20:57.724 --> 21:00.660
I think he just
wanted to keep them.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.829
I don't know.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.797
Maybe he is a little weird.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.798
- Maybe.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.202
- But you know that's really
none of your business.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.438
You should go.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.707
- Oh come on, it will
be like we're teenagers.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.477
I'll be the bad
boyfriend sneaking in.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.413
- We're not teenagers anymore.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.915
- Helen, who's he?

21:26.218 --> 21:28.787
- He's here to help me babysit.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.821
- What up, little man?

21:29.822 --> 21:30.822
I'm Tom.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.771
- You're not supposed
to have company.

21:33.795 --> 21:35.461
- I know.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.797
Tom was just about to leave.

21:39.966 --> 21:40.966
What is it?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.636
Is anything wrong?

21:44.971 --> 21:48.140
- First it was like breathing.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.078
Then, a voice, whispering.

21:54.213 --> 21:57.115
- See I told you that
movie was a bad idea.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.484
- It's not the film, I heard it.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.251
Someone is in there.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.252
- Okay.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.322
Let's see then.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.357
- Wait!

22:06.393 --> 22:07.593
- It's nothing, Lucas.

22:07.594 --> 22:10.496
Old houses make strange
sounds sometimes.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.309
See, empty.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.915
Now you're going to go to bed.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.384
- You think I'm making it up.

22:32.385 --> 22:35.554
You just want me to stay up
here, so you can be with him.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.256
- I already told you I was
going to tell him to leave.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.091
- No you're not.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.893
- Listen you don't need
to worry about things

22:41.894 --> 22:43.962
that don't concern you.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.864
There is nothing in your closet.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.499
The only reason you're
scared is because

22:47.500 --> 22:50.368
I let you watch
that scary movie.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.203
- What if it's that old man?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.239
- There is no old man, okay?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.608
It's just all in your head.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.844
- Yeah because I'm a weird kid.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.247
- Lucas...

23:02.248 --> 23:03.615
- You can leave now.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.017
I'm going to bed.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.734
- So was it Robert Bowery?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.503
- You're still here.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.404
- He's not scared
of the Boogie Man.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.940
He's got a crush on you, and
he wants to get rid of me.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.509
Smart kid.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.511
- I think I messed that one up.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.979
- What are you talking about?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.946
He's a kid, he's going
to forget in two seconds.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.015
What does that even mean?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.916
If you mess up, you can't
babysit here anymore?

23:38.917 --> 23:39.917
Big deal.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.956
I think it's actually
a good thing,

23:44.957 --> 23:48.760
because you really should be
spending more time with me.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.237
I miss you.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.697
It's good to hear
that you miss me too.

24:06.698 --> 24:08.298
I know that's got to
be a complex emotion

24:08.322 --> 24:10.238
to sort of put into words.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.720
- Tom, I'm pregnant.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.324
- What?

24:23.462 --> 24:24.462
Is it mine?

25:14.647 --> 25:16.715
When were you going
to tell me this?

25:16.716 --> 25:18.217
- I just told you.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.555
- Are you going to keep it?

25:28.127 --> 25:30.061
- Did you hear that?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.063
- Hear what?

25:37.003 --> 25:38.069
- Lucas?

26:03.362 --> 26:05.131
Tom, check the study.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.534
Lucas?

26:14.273 --> 26:15.707
- He's not there.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.511
- I think I know where he went.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.149
Lucas?

26:26.052 --> 26:27.787
Lucas, where are you?

26:30.589 --> 26:32.509
- Kid could be
anywhere, this is pointless.

26:32.533 --> 26:36.227
- No he would have followed
the path, he's a smart kid.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.496
- I think we should
call someone.

26:38.497 --> 26:42.067
- Why, so they can
clean up our mess?

26:42.068 --> 26:43.569
- Your mess.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.772
- See, this is why
I've been avoiding you.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.040
You can't deal when
things get serious.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.208
- Helen.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.643
- No please, let me finish.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.679
- No, Helen, what is that?

27:00.653 --> 27:01.887
- That's feathers.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.274
That's his blanket.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.900
- Hey wait a minute,
what do you got there?

27:48.901 --> 27:51.236
- Just some files
Connolly asked me to get.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.304
- From the basement?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.305
Let me see.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.978
The Bowery case?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.679
What the hell for?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.514
- What are you looking at?

28:03.515 --> 28:06.051
- I should probably get
these to the sheriff.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.686
- The Child
Eater of Widow's Peak.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.388
Bowery was a weird one.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.324
No one suspected a thing,
little did we know.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.493
- My mom says it's
because of those woods.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.662
Said he spent too much
time there, went too deep.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.798
- Bunch of horse
shit, he snapped.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.199
Developed an eye disease.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.901
- Macular degeneration.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.102
It's genetic.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.971
- He slowly went blind.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.812
But at some point it
seems he started believing

28:27.836 --> 28:31.276
eating other folks'
eyes would cure his own.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.712
Said the younger, the better.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.882
He put a mask over their heads

28:36.883 --> 28:39.918
to make them as blind as he was.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.253
This death mask.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.259
- What is this, ghost
stories around the camp fire?

28:48.260 --> 28:51.396
Should I go out and buy
some goddamn marshmallows?

28:51.397 --> 28:54.300
Old bastard was
just a sick sadist.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.151
- Did you hear that?

29:13.152 --> 29:14.385
- What?

29:14.386 --> 29:15.866
- The sound of every
bone in your body

29:15.890 --> 29:18.423
telling you not
to go any further.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.927
- He is just hiding somewhere.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.760
Lucas?

29:24.063 --> 29:27.900
Okay you got what you wanted,
we're out here, now let's go.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.435
- Stop!

29:32.338 --> 29:34.639
- Jesus Christ,
that's a fucking bear trap.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.376
- Are there bears
in these woods?

29:38.811 --> 29:41.046
- What if Lucas
stepped into one of these?

29:41.047 --> 29:43.849
- I mean we know, we would hear
him screaming his lungs out.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.316
- Tom.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.418
- No I mean it, Helen,
seriously, we would know.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.076
- Are you in here?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.551
Tom, look at this.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.889
Someone has been here.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.450
- Of course
someone has been here,

30:25.474 --> 30:27.058
this place is legendary.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.626
- Did you ever come here?

30:28.627 --> 30:32.798
- No but I was never into
this kind of stuff any way.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.570
Used to play hide and seek.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.539
Apparently he was so unassuming,

30:41.540 --> 30:42.940
you could just be
in a room with him

30:42.964 --> 30:45.376
for minutes before you
would even notice him.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.345
- It wasn't until
you heard him breathing

30:47.346 --> 30:50.248
that you realized
he was right there.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.650
I remember the stories.

30:52.651 --> 30:54.921
They used to keep me awake.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.294
- Lucas?

32:13.533 --> 32:14.533
- Hey.

32:31.984 --> 32:32.984
- Teeth.

32:34.454 --> 32:35.454
- Hey, you!

32:40.059 --> 32:42.427
Hey we're looking for
someone, it's a little kid.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.236
- Help, Helen!

32:54.273 --> 32:55.273
Help!

32:56.408 --> 32:57.542
Help!

32:57.543 --> 32:58.577
Help!

33:03.415 --> 33:04.915
Ah.

33:04.916 --> 33:05.984
No, fuck, no!

33:13.459 --> 33:14.625
- Tom?

33:53.500 --> 33:54.500
Fuck!

34:20.826 --> 34:24.996
♪ He'll sing you songs
and tell you lies

34:26.431 --> 34:30.501
♪ But all he wants is
to taste your eyes ♪

35:24.090 --> 35:25.090
Hello?

35:34.766 --> 35:35.833
Is anyone here?

35:43.442 --> 35:45.944
I just need to use your phone.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.248
I need to call the police.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.754
- So close them shut.

36:29.755 --> 36:33.659
Run away, or you'll never
see the light of day.

37:38.123 --> 37:39.590
- Help!

37:39.591 --> 37:41.392
Somebody please help me!

37:48.133 --> 37:49.967
- Call Lucas.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.537
- Please let me go.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.174
- Call him, and
we will end this now.

38:00.579 --> 38:03.948
He may not be able to see,
but he can hear everything.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.850
He can smell blood.

38:05.851 --> 38:09.788
He knows these woods like
the back of his hand.

38:11.143 --> 38:13.023
So which do you want: The
boy out there with him

38:13.024 --> 38:14.360
or here with us?

38:15.594 --> 38:17.362
- Who are you?

38:24.002 --> 38:27.238
- I was the one that got away.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.116
They thought he was dead.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.584
But evil never dies.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.757
In these woods, it lingers.

39:19.758 --> 39:20.758
Dwells.

39:22.828 --> 39:26.998
When I was a child, long
before Robert Bowery went mad,

39:29.501 --> 39:31.837
there was an old, old story.

39:33.271 --> 39:37.208
They say the stork comes
at night and brings people

39:40.178 --> 39:42.379
their newborn babies.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.516
But this was another
kind of stork.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.251
One with black feathers.

39:53.525 --> 39:56.628
Every once in a
while, he would call.

39:58.096 --> 40:02.200
A call only children of bad
unworthy parents could hear.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.281
They would crawl out of
their beds in the middle

40:05.305 --> 40:08.439
of the night and follow
the call, all the way

40:08.440 --> 40:12.043
up the hill to where
the stork was waiting.

40:13.879 --> 40:17.181
Once they got there, he
would peck out their eyes

40:17.182 --> 40:20.384
with his beak, and all the
blind babies would crawl

40:20.385 --> 40:23.521
around the woods and couldn't
find their ways back home.

40:27.726 --> 40:30.228
Then the stork ate the babies.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.264
Their blood soaked up the soil.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.335
The trees and the grass
grew from that bloody soil.

40:38.336 --> 40:42.240
That place is built on
that blood of innocents.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.818
- Widow's Peak
sheriff's office, this is Casey.

42:08.842 --> 42:12.346
- Casey, Casey
I'm being attacked.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.566
- Helen, is that you?

42:15.567 --> 42:18.002
- Lucas got lost in the woods

42:18.003 --> 42:19.838
and there was someone.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.140
He killed Tom.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.576
- What do you mean killed Tom?

42:28.213 --> 42:29.513
Helen, talk to me.

42:35.486 --> 42:38.990
- I think
someone is in the house.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.326
Come now, please.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.828
- What is it?

42:43.829 --> 42:44.896
- It's Helen.

43:25.036 --> 43:26.270
- No.

44:20.258 --> 44:22.192
- Hey, it's okay, relax.

44:22.193 --> 44:24.095
You're in the hospital.

44:30.335 --> 44:32.170
Tell me what happened.

44:43.081 --> 44:44.750
Lincoln S2S51, copy.

44:46.284 --> 44:48.819
- Copy, sheriff, over.

44:48.820 --> 44:51.889
- She said there was someone
in the house with her also.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.725
Gave me a description.

44:55.160 --> 44:59.330
Tall, long pale face, long
limbs, wearing glasses.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.199
- Sir that sounds a lot like...

45:02.200 --> 45:04.120
- I know exactly what it
sounds like, lieutenant.

45:04.144 --> 45:06.270
Just keep your eyes open.

45:06.271 --> 45:09.339
Somebody is hiding
out in those woods.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.674
- Copy that.

45:10.675 --> 45:12.076
We traced them out to the zoo,

45:12.077 --> 45:13.778
we're going to take a look.

45:13.779 --> 45:18.182
- Let's be careful, there is
a little kid out there also.

45:18.183 --> 45:19.649
So just don't get trigger happy.

45:19.650 --> 45:22.186
I'll be there as soon as
I locate the kid's dad.

45:22.187 --> 45:24.088
- Must have been
a good date, huh?

45:24.089 --> 45:26.049
- Focus on the
task at hand, lieutenant.

45:26.073 --> 45:27.174
Over and out.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.662
- Your little friend over there,

45:32.663 --> 45:34.223
the sheriff's daughter
might be a little

45:34.247 --> 45:37.034
coo-coo in the head, if
you know what I mean.

45:37.035 --> 45:38.804
Right, let's do this.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.762
- Hello?

46:06.397 --> 46:07.397
Helen?

46:08.399 --> 46:10.668
- Shh, quiet, boy.

46:11.937 --> 46:14.338
Don't you know who
may be listening?

46:19.545 --> 46:20.545
Hi.

46:30.922 --> 46:32.789
Here, for you.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.228
You must be hungry.

46:40.031 --> 46:41.465
And cold, huh?

46:43.401 --> 46:46.503
Why don't you come back
with me to my house?

46:46.504 --> 46:47.938
We'll call the police.

46:49.407 --> 46:50.474
- Who are you?

46:50.475 --> 46:51.475
- Shh.

47:00.018 --> 47:01.219
Come on, Lucas.

47:03.022 --> 47:04.022
Come with me.

47:06.757 --> 47:07.757
No, Lucas.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.164
- You were lucky.

47:14.165 --> 47:16.666
The knife in your side
didn't hit any major organs.

47:16.667 --> 47:20.104
A matter of millimeters,
but nothing serious.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.640
- And the...

47:25.576 --> 47:27.277
- The baby is going to be fine.

47:27.278 --> 47:29.714
You are both doing just fine.

47:31.516 --> 47:32.582
- Where is he?

47:32.583 --> 47:34.551
Where is sheriff Connolly?

47:34.552 --> 47:35.552
Sheriff?

47:41.592 --> 47:42.626
- Mr. Parker.

47:42.627 --> 47:43.828
- Where is my son?

47:43.829 --> 47:44.929
What happened?

47:44.930 --> 47:47.029
- Everything is
going to be fine, trust me.

47:47.030 --> 47:48.064
Trust me on this one.

47:48.065 --> 47:49.398
Everything is going to be fine.

47:49.399 --> 47:50.434
Nurse.

47:50.435 --> 47:51.467
- Where were you?

47:51.468 --> 47:53.001
You were supposed
to take care of him.

47:53.002 --> 47:54.282
You were supposed
to protect him.

47:54.283 --> 47:55.918
- Could you give her something

47:55.919 --> 47:57.005
to calm her down, please?

47:57.006 --> 47:58.842
I will take responsibility
for this situation.

47:58.843 --> 48:01.478
I have every officer in my outfit
working on this right now.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.414
Your son will be found.

48:05.316 --> 48:07.284
- This is the place.

48:07.285 --> 48:08.752
- What place?

48:08.753 --> 48:12.090
- The nest, where he took them,

48:13.191 --> 48:15.026
to play hide and seek.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.667
Except he knew the
building by heart,

48:17.691 --> 48:19.930
so he always found them.

48:19.931 --> 48:21.691
- Come on,
Wesley, give it a break.

48:21.715 --> 48:23.717
- We're, we're going in?

48:28.639 --> 48:31.175
- You two take the back,
I'll check the front.

48:37.983 --> 48:40.517
- What kind of animal
did they keep in there?

48:40.518 --> 48:42.386
- Something big.

49:24.195 --> 49:28.199
- Hey, Casey, there is
someone under the bridge.

49:40.811 --> 49:41.811
A monster.

49:45.483 --> 49:48.385
You're too stressed out, man.

49:48.386 --> 49:50.226
This job is a lot of
running around in the dark

49:50.250 --> 49:52.456
for reasons you
don't understand.

49:52.457 --> 49:54.292
Better get used to it.

49:55.226 --> 49:56.827
- I'm fine.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.612
- There's something down here.

50:48.613 --> 50:49.846
Come take a look.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.951
What does that look like to you?

50:58.989 --> 51:00.625
- I don't know, mud?

51:02.760 --> 51:04.428
- Doesn't smell like mud.

51:08.933 --> 51:10.534
- Come out.

51:10.535 --> 51:12.402
It's the police, I
have my gun drawn.

51:28.653 --> 51:30.654
- Was that Wes?

51:34.024 --> 51:35.024
Wes?

51:36.127 --> 51:37.394
- I'll check it out.

51:54.212 --> 51:55.212
Wesley?

52:04.656 --> 52:05.656
- Fuck.

52:42.527 --> 52:43.527
Sheriff?

52:44.129 --> 52:45.129
Anyone?

52:49.735 --> 52:50.735
Goddammit.

53:03.948 --> 53:05.148
Hey.

53:05.149 --> 53:06.216
Lucas.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.633
- No, no.

57:50.067 --> 57:51.735
- Run, boy.

57:51.736 --> 57:52.903
This ends now.

58:54.933 --> 58:56.213
- Lincoln 72S51, 10-20.

59:00.605 --> 59:02.639
Wesley, come in, over.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.575
- Sheriff, sheriff.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.274
- Oh my God.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.344
Daddy?

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:19.082
Daddy?

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:28.624
Hello, I need an ambulance,
please send help.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.795
Dad, Dad, can you hear me?

01:00:31.763 --> 01:00:32.763
Are you okay?

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.365
Are you all right?

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.667
Are you all right?

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:40.269
- I already called
the 100 dispatch,

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.537
they're on their way.

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:43.072
- They'll be right back, okay?

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.608
Just in a few minutes and
I'm going to send for help.

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:48.577
- No, don't go back out there.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.714
- He's my responsibility.

01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:52.015

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:11.268
- You be a good mother.

01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:14.238
You have, fresh eyes.

01:01:35.093 --> 01:01:36.093
- Lucas?

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:21.038
- Lucas.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
Lucas.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:51.928
- Lucas?

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:52.996
- Helen?

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:34.537

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:20.870
Lucas?

01:07:39.857 --> 01:07:40.857
Lucas.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:47.296
- Shh, quiet,
or he'll come back.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:48.997
- Come on, let's go.

01:08:42.687 --> 01:08:43.687
- Helen.

01:08:43.688 --> 01:08:44.754
- Casey.

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:51.194
All the stories are
true, they never stop.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:09.845
- Hey.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:12.046
- No, Lucas stop, Lucas run.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.300
- Lucas, get out of the way.

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.108
Move, Lucas.

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:23.786
- Okay.

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:24.821
You go that way.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.531
- Hey, Bowery, I'm right here,

01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:36.632
come and get me.

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:49.678
Come and get me.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:52.147
Come on, I'm here,
come and get me.

01:11:02.393 --> 01:11:03.393
- Helen!

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.905
- Lucas.

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:18.206
- Wait, no.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:24.713
- No!

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:29.553
No!

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:37.185
- You're dead.

01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:45.561
You want it?

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:46.563
You want it?

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:49.798
You want it?

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.567
Choke on it.

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:52.602
Choke on it.

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:47.390
- Is he dead?

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.157
- He's dead.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:28.076
- They're best
when they're fresh.
