I texted you like 15,000 times.

didn't respond,

to dress up as Charlie's Angels?

me be Lucy Liu.

Jennifar, if maybe this time

05:45.179 --> 05:48.081
that we play Charlie's Angels
because after all these years,

05:48.182 --> 05:49.716
I've never played Lucy Liu.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.685
And I was wondering if this
time maybe,

05:51.785 --> 05:53.887
if it's okay with you,
that I could play her,

05:53.987 --> 05:55.222
just because we share

05:55.322 --> 05:57.224
a common Asian-American
heritage.

she was--

06:02.796 --> 06:04.031

talent.

I made that bitch sound like
Donald Duck.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.360
- Little bit. Yeah.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.063
- Do you think maybe she's
right? I mean...

18:18.163 --> 18:21.099
the city's changed but we
haven't.

18:21.199 --> 18:25.170
- Melanie, look around you.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.072
New York never really
changes.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.740
You know?

18:28.840 --> 18:31.109
- Let's make one more stop.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.478
You're not gonna regret it.
- [unintelligible]

18:33.578 --> 18:34.546
- Better.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.383
Remember when that
bodega cat followed us here?

18:38.483 --> 18:40.752
- NORA: Yes, we were feeding
it pretzels

18:40.852 --> 18:45.524
and then we fed it that
chocolate dipped one

18:45.624 --> 18:48.860
and it died right there.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.164
- Why are so many people
saying New York is dead?

18:52.264 --> 18:55.867
I have a ton of friends who
are leaving the city.

18:56.001 --> 19:01.807
They're going to like, LA,
Austin, West Virginia.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.643
- West Virginia?
- It's the mountains.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.044
- Yeah, yeah, like that song.

19:06.144 --> 19:08.713
Right?
- Yeah.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.882
I just don't wanna be
a townie, Nora.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.517
- We're not townies.

19:12.617 --> 19:14.886
We're New Yorkers, you know.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.455
[stuttering]

19:16.555 --> 19:19.224
We like, live here and die
here, you know.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.560
And we can't let all the
Kales come up in here

19:21.660 --> 19:25.864
and build a Talbot's.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.999
- You're right.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.136
- You remember earlier when
I had a full-blown orgasm?

19:31.236 --> 19:34.739
As a result, my toes are
spread like starfish

19:34.840 --> 19:36.074
and I feel like they're stuck
that way.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.375
- MELANIE: Okay, you made
it weird.

19:37.476 --> 19:38.743
- NORA: No, I didn't.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.278
It's been very uncomfortable,
especially when I'm forced

19:40.378 --> 19:42.147
to wear heels.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.415
Okay.

19:47.819 --> 19:51.022
- [door squeaking]

19:52.790 --> 19:55.059
- Hey, you're back!

19:55.159 --> 19:57.261
- What are you doing up,
it's like 4 a.m.?

19:57.362 --> 20:01.733
- Oh, I just got back from
taking Rosalind to the airport.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.234
- Uh-huh.
- And...

20:05.870 --> 20:07.739
- Oh, what's that for?

20:07.839 --> 20:10.007
- Oh, just for being you.

20:10.108 --> 20:13.144
And for being there always.

20:13.244 --> 20:15.213
- You too.

20:15.313 --> 20:20.018
- So, did you have a good
night with your friends?

20:20.118 --> 20:24.389
- Umm, yeah, it was alright.

20:24.489 --> 20:29.060
- So did Jennifar at least
let you be Lucy Liu this time?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.962
- No, I was Cameron Diaz.

20:31.062 --> 20:32.864
But that's okay.
I don't mind that.

20:32.964 --> 20:35.266
- I like that scene where
she got the semen

20:35.366 --> 20:36.901
all over her hair.

20:37.001 --> 20:39.037
- That's not Charlie's Angels.
That happened in...

20:39.137 --> 20:41.472
But yeah, no, that was good.

20:41.572 --> 20:44.509
- What you got on your pants?
- It's not, it's just leather.

20:44.609 --> 20:45.977
They're pleather.
- Pleather?

20:46.077 --> 20:47.245
Yeah, but what's making 'em
stiff?

20:47.345 --> 20:48.946
Is that semen?
Did you get semen

20:49.047 --> 20:50.615
all over your pants?
- NORA: No, I don't.
