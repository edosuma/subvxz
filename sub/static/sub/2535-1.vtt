05:13.628 --> 05:15.254
François! There he is.

05:15.422 --> 05:16.839
Mister Roullot.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.468
Have a seat.

05:23.221 --> 05:25.139
Tell me. How are you doing?

05:25.557 --> 05:27.141
Come on, sit! Sit!

05:30.687 --> 05:32.104
No thank you. I’m OK.

05:32.272 --> 05:33.439
Thank you very much.

05:35.025 --> 05:35.691
I'm fine!

05:36.068 --> 05:38.235
So, what have you got for me?

05:40.155 --> 05:44.116
Just a few items regarding protocol
upon your return to France.

05:44.284 --> 05:49.246
We've decided that there
should be someone assigned 24/7 to...

05:49.623 --> 05:53.000
not supervise but... someone
in the background on continuous rotation.

05:53.627 --> 05:57.254
We've installed metal detectors
at your offices. In your homes...

05:57.422 --> 05:59.590
Both offices and all three homes.
Same goes for Simone.

06:00.425 --> 06:04.136
And from now on... this might be
a little more delicate but...

06:04.304 --> 06:08.516
Everyone will have to carry
an accreditation issued by my office.

06:09.267 --> 06:11.394
It’s a bit much, isn't it?

06:12.062 --> 06:13.187
Don't you think?

06:14.481 --> 06:18.734
Given the circumstances,
we think it's appropriate.

06:19.236 --> 06:21.862
You should know there are rumors.

06:25.951 --> 06:29.662
Rumors that have already spread
quite a bit

06:29.830 --> 06:31.497
within the United States Secret Service.

06:34.584 --> 06:36.502
I shouldn't be the one to tell you.

07:00.569 --> 07:03.404
Wait, look at this. There you are!

07:05.449 --> 07:09.118
Let me introduce you to Anna.
This is François.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.169
No, you're too kind. I'm OK.

07:19.212 --> 07:22.006
I didn't come for that.
I’m on duty, thanks.

07:39.441 --> 07:43.736
My dear sir,
thank your for your attention.

07:44.279 --> 07:46.405
And on that note,
I’m going to have to go.

07:52.996 --> 07:54.413
Just sit for a second.

07:54.581 --> 07:56.874
Unfortunately, we have to go.

07:57.292 --> 07:58.667
Thank you for your attention.

07:58.835 --> 08:00.753
Alright, no big deal.

08:03.632 --> 08:06.050
Careful out there. Long live France!

11:19.160 --> 11:21.912
- Do you need help with your bags?
- No thank you.

11:24.499 --> 11:26.166
- How have you been?
- Very well.

11:26.710 --> 11:27.626
You're in great shape.

11:27.794 --> 11:28.585
Well, thank you.

11:28.837 --> 11:29.962
Are you still dancing?

11:30.130 --> 11:31.505
Yes, of course.

11:32.048 --> 11:33.090
Did you have a nice trip?

11:33.258 --> 11:34.258
Very pleasant.

11:34.426 --> 11:35.551
Everything went well?

11:35.719 --> 11:36.510
Very well.

11:37.137 --> 11:38.762
Where are you going on vacation?

11:39.305 --> 11:41.932
I’m off to Greece soon, apparently.

11:43.017 --> 11:44.059
Have you ever been?

11:44.227 --> 11:45.853
Watch out for those Greeks!

12:06.458 --> 12:07.833
We're almost there.

12:08.835 --> 12:11.086
So you're taking singing classes?

12:11.337 --> 12:14.923
- You know everything.
- Yes.

12:14.966 --> 12:16.467
This is your room.

33:50.052 --> 33:51.594
What are you having, sweetie?

33:51.887 --> 33:53.554
Something light, maybe a salad.

33:54.389 --> 33:55.890
You know what, I’ll have...

33:57.100 --> 33:58.100
I’ll have...

34:45.524 --> 34:47.358
When you work in a bank

34:47.692 --> 34:50.527
people tend to listen
to what you have to say.

34:59.788 --> 35:02.081
How's the fucking? Any good?

35:04.334 --> 35:05.209
What?

35:18.890 --> 35:20.474
I’m not allowed to know.

35:21.101 --> 35:24.562
Come on, it's nothing.
Fucking is natural. Are you at least-

35:24.729 --> 35:26.230
Enough!

35:27.023 --> 35:29.775
I, for one,
fucked all night and it was great.

35:29.943 --> 35:32.987
It’s so important
to feel good with a man.

35:33.321 --> 35:35.406
I know I’m not supposed
to say things like-

35:35.574 --> 35:38.450
OK, Dad, enough. We got it.

42:18.268 --> 42:21.353
I left my blackberry at the hotel.

42:21.604 --> 42:23.355
Security's going to run it over to me.

42:23.523 --> 42:25.399
Would you mind...

42:25.567 --> 42:27.693
I’ll warn the gate manager.

42:27.986 --> 42:30.654
I’m heading back to Paris.
I don't want to forget it.

42:30.822 --> 42:33.073
Worst case,
we can have it sent insured mail.

42:33.241 --> 42:34.491
No, I don't want it mailed.

42:34.659 --> 42:35.826
They're going to run it over to me.

42:35.994 --> 42:38.161
Then let's go see the gate manager.

42:48.715 --> 42:51.300
Let's go talk to the head of security.

42:58.808 --> 42:59.683
Sorry.

42:59.851 --> 43:00.726
Not a problem, sir.

43:00.893 --> 43:02.436
I'm sorry for the trouble.

43:02.979 --> 43:04.187
Everything taken care of?
Are we good?

43:04.355 --> 43:05.564
Yes, you may board.

43:05.732 --> 43:08.108
Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.

43:22.749 --> 43:23.874
Have a pleasant trip, Mr. Devereaux.

43:24.042 --> 43:25.000
Thank you very much.

46:06.913 --> 46:08.371
It’s in a different passport.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.499
In my other passport.

51:20.392 --> 51:26.189
If I could only find the words to express
our gratitude to Simone.

51:27.233 --> 51:28.733
For her devotion.

51:29.777 --> 51:33.279
For her love for the State of Israel.

51:33.739 --> 51:36.366
You are too kind. I'm only-

51:36.534 --> 51:40.745
Not to mention the charities
she has founded single-handedly,

51:41.831 --> 51:44.165
worldwide...

51:46.252 --> 51:49.462
And the justice she has restored

51:49.630 --> 51:51.965
to those without a voice.

01:16:17.388 --> 01:16:18.555
Here we are.

01:16:21.058 --> 01:16:22.267
This is the house.

01:16:27.273 --> 01:16:30.275
It’s a little dark, but I’m sure it'll do.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.780
This is what $60,000 gets you.

01:16:41.746 --> 01:16:43.038
It’s big.

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:07.826
I need something to drink.

01:25:54.715 --> 01:25:55.631
What's wrong?

01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:58.342
Mr. Devereaux?

01:25:58.719 --> 01:26:00.720
Yeah. Can you introduce me?

01:26:00.888 --> 01:26:02.096
Absolutely.

01:26:08.854 --> 01:26:10.438
Hi, Mr. Devereaux.

01:26:12.107 --> 01:26:12.982
How are you, Michel?

01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:14.525
Just fine. How are you?

01:26:14.985 --> 01:26:17.195
Allow me to introduce my little girl.

01:26:18.113 --> 01:26:18.821
What a pleasure...

01:26:18.989 --> 01:26:19.864
Marie.

01:26:21.074 --> 01:26:22.533
What is it that Marie does?

01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:23.784
I'm in law school.

01:26:24.328 --> 01:26:26.454
- What year?
- Third.

01:26:28.332 --> 01:26:29.624
That's fantastic.

01:26:29.791 --> 01:26:31.959
Are you enjoying the exhibition?

01:26:32.127 --> 01:26:33.419
Yeah, it's not bad.

01:26:34.046 --> 01:26:37.006
I like that it's about Africa.
It’s something I'm interested in.

01:26:37.174 --> 01:26:38.633
And what do you want to do?

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.176
I want to be a lawyer.

01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:47.934
Are you proud of your...
These are young artists from Sarcelles?

01:26:48.227 --> 01:26:50.686
Yeah, you gotta...

01:26:50.854 --> 01:26:51.729
Sorry...

01:26:53.941 --> 01:26:55.441
One needs to...

01:26:55.609 --> 01:26:57.360
Are you also into photography?

01:26:57.527 --> 01:26:58.611
I would love to...

01:26:58.779 --> 01:27:02.823
But law school keeps me pretty busy.

01:27:04.451 --> 01:27:05.534
How old are you?

01:27:05.702 --> 01:27:07.411
Sorry, I'm a little intimidated...

01:27:09.122 --> 01:27:10.373
You're very beautiful.

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.415
Thank you.

01:27:15.128 --> 01:27:17.046
Maybe we can meet up later?

01:27:32.729 --> 01:27:34.272
What do you think of him?

01:27:36.608 --> 01:27:39.068
Yeah. He's interesting.

01:27:45.993 --> 01:27:50.997
What was it you wanted to do?
Where did you want to work?

01:27:51.748 --> 01:27:54.375
I want to work
for the lnternational Criminal Court.

01:27:55.252 --> 01:27:59.672
You'll be confronting real murderers.

01:28:00.048 --> 01:28:01.173
Yes.

01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:02.967
I’ll prosecute them.

01:28:03.135 --> 01:28:04.302
What do you like about it?

01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:06.762
Justice?

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.222
Yes, justice.

01:28:11.393 --> 01:28:13.436
So who are you seeing,
aside from your wife?

01:28:14.354 --> 01:28:17.064
Hardly anyone.
My work keeps me busy.

01:28:17.816 --> 01:28:18.858
I don't believe you.

01:28:19.026 --> 01:28:22.361
Yes! People credit me
with more than my share of affairs.

01:28:23.864 --> 01:28:25.656
But I have nothing against that.

01:28:25.824 --> 01:28:29.368
Womanizers are a turn-on, aren't they?

01:28:30.329 --> 01:28:31.537
And intelligent men.

01:28:32.831 --> 01:28:36.584
What turns you on more?
Womanizers or intelligent men?

01:28:36.752 --> 01:28:38.919
Brilliant men like you.

01:29:14.373 --> 01:29:17.083
Do I look like the girls
you usually sleep with?

01:29:18.251 --> 01:29:19.126
No.

01:29:20.337 --> 01:29:24.799
They don't have your youth,
your beauty, your intelligence.

01:29:25.967 --> 01:29:28.219
You know, I used to really like...

01:29:29.888 --> 01:29:32.598
How can I put it?
I liked sluts. Whores.

01:29:34.643 --> 01:29:36.602
I can't shake the reputation.

01:29:37.104 --> 01:29:40.898
But with you...
You know what I mean.

01:29:41.191 --> 01:29:43.484
I was at boarding school, with the nuns.

01:29:44.486 --> 01:29:46.487
Now I’m even more excited.

01:29:48.115 --> 01:29:50.032
Come here, cutie pie.

01:29:55.163 --> 01:29:57.998
Oh that's good.
Did the nuns teach you that?

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.878
They're brilliant. They really are.

01:30:03.046 --> 01:30:05.339
They were great.
We studied this all day long.

01:30:05.882 --> 01:30:10.261
There were lots of erotic books
in the 17th and 18th centuries

01:30:10.429 --> 01:30:11.554
Written by nuns.

01:30:11.763 --> 01:30:12.596
Written by nuns?

01:30:12.848 --> 01:30:13.639
Of course!

01:30:13.807 --> 01:30:15.307
They were crazy about sex.

01:30:15.475 --> 01:30:19.728
Most nuns joined the convent

01:30:19.896 --> 01:30:23.566
Because their families sent them off.

01:30:25.652 --> 01:30:28.154
Because they had committed adultery.

01:30:31.992 --> 01:30:34.201
They're going to send you
to the convent too.

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:39.331
You're so beautiful, my darling.

01:35:03.513 --> 01:35:04.680
A very good year!

01:35:17.110 --> 01:35:18.736
Thank you, Mr. Devereaux.

01:35:18.903 --> 01:35:21.822
A promise is a promise.

01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:23.782
And I promised you this interview.

01:35:24.951 --> 01:35:28.203
As long as things don't get too personal.

01:35:28.371 --> 01:35:29.747
Is this your office?

01:35:29.914 --> 01:35:32.458
Yes, but we'll go over here.

01:35:32.959 --> 01:35:34.418
You don't want to do it in there?

01:35:34.586 --> 01:35:36.462
No, a lot of people come through here.

01:35:37.422 --> 01:35:39.173
OK, as you wish.

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:43.010
It’s very kind of you
to grant me this interview.

01:35:43.303 --> 01:35:45.345
Here we are, take a seat over there.

01:35:45.513 --> 01:35:47.473
This is where I rest when I’m working,

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:50.100
but I also use it for interviews.

01:35:53.438 --> 01:35:55.189
What would you like to know?

01:35:59.903 --> 01:36:02.529
By the way, I read your book.
It’s very good.

01:36:02.697 --> 01:36:04.573
- Is that true?
- Quite the wordsmith.

01:36:04.741 --> 01:36:07.743
You read it? That's so kind of you!

01:36:08.119 --> 01:36:12.039
That's really... nice.
Really, I'm pleased.

01:36:12.457 --> 01:36:17.795
It was so nice of you to agree to this.
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

01:36:18.505 --> 01:36:25.469
Can you tell me how you lost
the Jean-Claude Méry tape?

01:36:26.179 --> 01:36:27.346
That's why I’m here.

01:36:27.889 --> 01:36:29.014
I didn't watch it.

01:36:29.474 --> 01:36:31.975
- You never saw it?
- No, I didn't watch the tape.

01:36:32.143 --> 01:36:37.773
I don't understand.
You told me you watched it.

01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:41.109
- No, I didn't see it.
- But if you didn't watch it then-

01:36:43.988 --> 01:36:45.572
You are quite beautiful.

01:36:46.115 --> 01:36:48.700
You're beautiful. You know-

01:36:48.868 --> 01:36:51.370
Look, if you never watched the-

01:36:51.538 --> 01:36:53.330
Hold on.
I know your mother well.

01:36:53.498 --> 01:36:54.122
Thank you for your-

01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:57.084
You know, I know your mother well.

01:36:58.378 --> 01:36:59.586
Very well, actually.

01:36:59.754 --> 01:37:02.214
She told me a lot about you
when you were a child.

01:37:02.382 --> 01:37:03.674
You are very gifted.

01:37:04.259 --> 01:37:06.134
You had a wonderful education.

01:37:07.303 --> 01:37:09.680
Why are you talking about my mother?

01:37:09.848 --> 01:37:11.890
Because I know her very well. Here...

01:37:12.058 --> 01:37:13.392
That's enough.

01:39:12.679 --> 01:39:13.971
Sorry.

01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:16.974
It will be OK.

01:39:18.142 --> 01:39:20.185
It’s not easy but it will be OK.

01:39:22.897 --> 01:39:25.607
What about Josh?
How's he dealing with all of this?

01:39:25.775 --> 01:39:28.193
Josh is OK,
but his parents are pretty upset.

01:39:29.570 --> 01:39:32.239
Have his parents
ever really been happy?

01:39:32.699 --> 01:39:34.282
I have no idea.

01:39:35.201 --> 01:39:38.161
But I do know they were happy
their son was dating the daughter

01:39:38.329 --> 01:39:40.664
of the head of a major
international institution.

01:39:41.332 --> 01:39:45.002
Maybe they should just be happy
that he was marrying you.

01:39:46.879 --> 01:39:50.507
I would marry you even if your father
was a scumbag.

01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:55.303
That's very nice,
but you know things don't work like that.

01:39:58.057 --> 01:39:59.141
And Simone?

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.268
Very angry.

01:40:03.646 --> 01:40:05.647
She never had much of a sense of humor.

01:40:12.196 --> 01:40:15.032
I shouldn't find any of this funny.

01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:17.075
You don't find it funny?

01:40:17.243 --> 01:40:18.910
She should accept you
the way Josh accepts me.

01:40:19.078 --> 01:40:20.412
She knew what she was getting into.

01:40:26.711 --> 01:40:27.919
What are you going to do?

01:40:33.509 --> 01:40:36.344
You mean when they ask:
"Blindfolded or not?"

01:40:36.512 --> 01:40:37.846
Dad, stop it!

01:40:43.352 --> 01:40:45.687
I wish I could have helped you to stop.

01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:48.231
I didn't want to.

01:40:49.609 --> 01:40:50.692
Correction.

01:40:51.527 --> 01:40:53.570
I don't want to.

01:40:58.284 --> 01:41:00.077
They can all go fuck themselves!

01:41:50.628 --> 01:41:52.671
I think it's a little bit my fault.

01:44:23.447 --> 01:44:24.990
It’s my fault.

01:44:26.492 --> 01:44:27.951
Just like everybody else...

01:44:33.082 --> 01:44:36.668
Since childhood, I’ve been brainwashed.

01:44:37.044 --> 01:44:40.338
By my parents, my teachers...

01:44:41.674 --> 01:44:45.218
My teachers, my superiors at work...

01:44:51.892 --> 01:44:56.313
I’m lucky, I'm not a Christian.

01:44:58.190 --> 01:44:59.858
But I'd like to say this:

01:45:00.651 --> 01:45:06.364
When I die,
I will kiss God's ass forever.

01:45:12.788 --> 01:45:14.414
I found my God...

01:45:16.417 --> 01:45:17.292
You.

01:45:43.402 --> 01:45:44.861
My first God?

01:45:47.948 --> 01:45:51.659
I didn't find it in a church,
but in a classroom.

01:45:53.579 --> 01:45:55.080
It was idealism.

01:45:55.664 --> 01:45:57.332
What a magnificent God!

01:45:58.542 --> 01:46:00.210
To believe everything would be OK.

01:46:03.172 --> 01:46:06.216
I was in the temple that is university.

01:46:06.717 --> 01:46:08.218
First as a student,

01:46:08.677 --> 01:46:10.220
then as a professor.

01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:15.100
And I allowed myself
to be wrapped in that hallowed light.

01:46:15.267 --> 01:46:16.351
Injustice?

01:46:17.728 --> 01:46:20.188
We had righted all the wrongs.

01:46:20.898 --> 01:46:22.232
World hunger?

01:46:23.192 --> 01:46:25.068
Everyone would eat until they were full.

01:46:25.486 --> 01:46:26.611
Poverty?

01:46:26.987 --> 01:46:31.699
A distant memory whose existence
would be difficult even to imagine.

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:37.539
Wealth would be spread around.

01:46:37.998 --> 01:46:39.958
To each according to his needs.

01:46:41.168 --> 01:46:42.210
That's right.

01:46:46.257 --> 01:46:48.258
It was only when I arrived
at the World Bank

01:46:48.426 --> 01:46:50.552
that the enormity
of the world's pathos,

01:46:50.719 --> 01:46:53.972
the infinite suffering
inherent in human nature,

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:57.642
revealed itself in all
its horrible manifestations.

01:47:00.604 --> 01:47:01.813
Slowly.

01:47:01.981 --> 01:47:03.440
One day at a time.

01:47:04.108 --> 01:47:04.858
No.

01:47:05.443 --> 01:47:07.318
One minute at a time.

01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:14.117
I understood the futility of struggling
against this insurmountable tsunami

01:47:16.954 --> 01:47:20.498
of troubles that we face.

01:47:21.959 --> 01:47:24.085
Things will not change.

01:47:24.795 --> 01:47:26.546
The hungry will die.

01:47:27.923 --> 01:47:28.882
The sick?

01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:31.551
They too will die.

01:47:32.344 --> 01:47:33.761
Poverty,

01:47:34.221 --> 01:47:36.222
It's good business.

01:47:37.349 --> 01:47:40.852
Wise men are comforted
by their limitations.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.105
I’m overwhelmed by this revelation.

01:47:44.356 --> 01:47:45.106
No.

01:47:46.066 --> 01:47:48.776
I can't return to that blissful youth.

01:47:48.944 --> 01:47:50.987
No redemption for me.

01:49:00.182 --> 01:49:01.724
What did the doctor say?

01:49:04.979 --> 01:49:07.188
He said it was all my mother's fault.

01:49:10.568 --> 01:49:11.401
Are you serious?

01:49:12.528 --> 01:49:14.571
He said he was having lunch
with his mother,

01:49:14.738 --> 01:49:17.365
and instead of asking her
to pass the butter, he told her

01:49:18.784 --> 01:49:21.953
"You fucking bitch, you ruined my life. "

01:50:10.044 --> 01:50:14.505
Another pedantic, narrow-minded
and shortsighted sophist,

01:50:14.673 --> 01:50:19.552
whose only goal is to convince me
to join the rest of herd.

01:50:21.096 --> 01:50:22.847
I won't fall in line.

01:50:23.849 --> 01:50:25.141
It pisses me off

01:50:25.309 --> 01:50:27.810
that one more time
I couldn't say no to you.

01:50:30.648 --> 01:50:32.482
Do you know what you've done,

01:50:33.150 --> 01:50:37.362
over these years,
little by little, bit by bit?

01:50:39.698 --> 01:50:43.368
You've succeeded
in making me hate myself.

01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:45.536
You see?

01:50:46.538 --> 01:50:47.664
You've succeeded.

01:52:10.497 --> 01:52:12.665
Damn it! Will you stop?

01:54:57.205 --> 01:54:58.789
Oh! I had forgotten your plans.

01:54:59.291 --> 01:55:01.042
Your plans of becoming president.

01:55:01.209 --> 01:55:04.754
Your plans for me to become
President of the Republic.

01:55:04.922 --> 01:55:07.131
That, I had forgotten about.

01:55:07.382 --> 01:55:10.176
It pisses you off
that I didn't end up in prison.

01:55:10.344 --> 01:55:12.136
No, it doesn't piss me off!

01:55:13.096 --> 01:55:17.808
To spend a little time
thinking about others.

01:55:17.976 --> 01:55:20.269
About yourself and what you've done.

01:55:21.146 --> 01:55:23.731
I think somehow
it would be good for you.

01:55:23.899 --> 01:55:26.067
A bit like military service,
which doesn't exist anymore.

01:55:26.234 --> 01:55:28.361
Sometimes it's good for a man.

01:55:28.528 --> 01:55:33.074
A little... a little...
Discipline, damn it!

01:55:33.241 --> 01:55:34.951
- I have discipline!
- You don't have discipline.

01:55:35.118 --> 01:55:37.411
It doesn't matter, you know my flaws.

01:55:37.579 --> 01:55:39.246
That's enough!

01:55:39.414 --> 01:55:40.373
I know.

01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:42.625
That's enough... I'm fed up.

01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:45.211
You're such a child!

01:55:45.379 --> 01:55:46.879
You're like a little child.

01:55:47.714 --> 01:55:49.632
I'm such a martyr!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.384
Me, me, me! Shit!

01:55:51.635 --> 01:55:53.594
I’ve been your wife for twenty years.

01:55:54.972 --> 01:55:56.263
But you're very happy to be my wife.

01:55:56.431 --> 01:55:59.767
I was very happy to be your wife.
I wanted it for my life.

01:56:05.524 --> 01:56:09.110
Your plans!
Your plans for me to become president.

01:56:09.611 --> 01:56:11.404
You, the First Lady.

01:56:12.072 --> 01:56:13.239
Your plans!

01:56:27.212 --> 01:56:28.546
I’m not capable.

01:56:36.722 --> 01:56:39.348
I’m not capable of being president.

01:56:39.516 --> 01:56:40.224
You know that.

01:56:40.392 --> 01:56:41.767
I don't want to.

01:56:46.481 --> 01:56:53.904
I don't owe anybody anything.

01:57:11.798 --> 01:57:14.592
What are you going to do
when we get back to Paris?

01:57:17.012 --> 01:57:19.013
I’m the monster. I’m the monster.

01:57:35.906 --> 01:57:40.576
That's wonderful.

01:58:19.032 --> 01:58:22.034
That is a beautiful phrase. Truly.
