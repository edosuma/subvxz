WEBVTT

00:22.625 --> 00:24.125
I promise you.

00:24.708 --> 00:25.916
I'll make this right.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.458
<i>Dear Jonas,</i>

01:31.541 --> 01:34.458
<i>you promised</i>
<i>to make everything right again.</i>

01:36.375 --> 01:38.541
<i>I want you to know you will do that.</i>

01:40.750 --> 01:44.666
<i>You must never lose hope</i>
<i>that there is a way out of this maze.</i>

01:46.291 --> 01:47.666
<i>A way to save me...</i>

01:49.166 --> 01:50.458
<i>and you.</i>

02:00.375 --> 02:02.416
<i>But we both have to make sacrifices,</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:07.166
<i>do unimaginable things,</i>

02:07.958 --> 02:10.083
<i>to untie the knot at the end.</i>

02:15.916 --> 02:19.291
<i>Each fate in this knot</i>
<i>is tied to the next.</i>

02:21.291 --> 02:22.291
<i>A thread,</i>

02:22.708 --> 02:24.000
<i>red like blood,</i>

02:25.125 --> 02:27.375
<i>that connects all our deeds.</i>

02:29.958 --> 02:30.791
<i>In light...</i>

02:33.250 --> 02:34.375
<i>and in shadow.</i>

02:43.916 --> 02:45.833
Why is Adam doing this?

02:50.875 --> 02:52.583
Why are you locking me up?

02:54.250 --> 02:55.833
<i>But the apocalypse</i>

02:57.125 --> 02:58.291
<i>must take place.</i>

02:59.916 --> 03:01.583
<i>You must let me die</i>

03:02.250 --> 03:03.666
<i>so I can live.</i>

03:05.250 --> 03:09.166
<i>We have to let some things go</i>
<i>before they find their way back to us.</i>

03:11.708 --> 03:13.375
<i>We are a perfect match.</i>

03:16.083 --> 03:17.833
<i>Never believe anything else.</i>

05:21.333 --> 05:27.000
LIGHT AND SHADOW

05:44.083 --> 05:48.000
DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

07:03.166 --> 07:04.166
Martha?

07:04.666 --> 07:06.166
Man, where were you?

07:06.250 --> 07:08.083
Mom cried all night long.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.375
Is everything okay?

07:21.791 --> 07:22.791
Hey.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.583
What happened?

07:31.916 --> 07:33.166
What's wrong?

07:35.291 --> 07:36.666
He was absolutely right.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.500
Bartosz was right.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.833
What he said in the forest...

07:47.333 --> 07:48.875
about the end of the world.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.291
The nuclear power plant. Today.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.708
Bartosz's father is trying
to cover up an accident.

07:55.791 --> 07:58.916
The barrels.
I know this sounds totally crazy, but...

07:59.000 --> 08:00.875
the world's coming to an end today.

08:03.666 --> 08:05.291
Have you got a screw loose?

08:06.625 --> 08:08.250
When did you last sleep?

08:09.166 --> 08:11.041
Are you even listening?

08:11.125 --> 08:12.125
The...

08:13.916 --> 08:15.750
I haven't got time for your psycho crap.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.875
I don't know what's going on with you.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.583
But it's not fair
to let Mom down like that.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.541
She doesn't deserve that.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.375
He had to die.

09:07.916 --> 09:09.500
You two are wrong...

09:12.208 --> 09:13.791
in his world.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.375
And in ours.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.375
I know what you're feeling.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.500
But you'll learn to let him go.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.333
Everything will run its course,

09:35.458 --> 09:37.750
just as fate determined...

09:39.000 --> 09:40.500
for our world...

09:41.666 --> 09:43.125
and his.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.375
Why did you lock me up?

10:05.208 --> 10:08.291
You promised me there would be a way
to change everything...

10:10.083 --> 10:12.125
so that the apocalypse doesn't happen.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.541
You lied to me
just like my older self lied to me.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.000
Sic Mundus.

10:29.458 --> 10:30.791
Old Tannhaus.

10:31.583 --> 10:35.125
He firmly believed
he was creating a paradise,

10:35.541 --> 10:38.041
where we would all be free
from our destiny...

10:38.958 --> 10:40.625
and free of pain.

10:44.125 --> 10:47.875
A world beyond your world and my world.

10:49.791 --> 10:51.041
But I...

10:51.916 --> 10:54.833
have finally realized
what paradise really is.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.375
Eternal darkness,

10:59.041 --> 11:01.041
in which nothing exists.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.083
But for that...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
the apocalypse must happen.

11:09.166 --> 11:10.041
In my world...

11:11.291 --> 11:12.666
and in yours.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.541
Jonas!

11:16.625 --> 11:17.625
Jonas!

11:17.708 --> 11:19.625
Let me out! Jonas!

11:25.083 --> 11:30.708
6 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

11:31.958 --> 11:33.375
<i>Where are the barrels?</i>

11:34.041 --> 11:35.458
<i>I want you to wait.</i>

11:36.208 --> 11:38.041
I don't care about that.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.458
You do what I say, Obendorf.

11:40.541 --> 11:41.666
Got it?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.416
Dad? Is everything okay?

11:50.416 --> 11:54.500
I know I said I'd stay home today,
but something came up.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.708
I'm sorry.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.625
It's all right.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.250
I have to tell you something.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.250
Someone is blackmailing me.

12:18.458 --> 12:19.500
What?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.291
With something...

12:28.375 --> 12:30.166
that happened a very long time ago.

12:34.458 --> 12:39.250
MURDER IN MARBURG
STILL UNSOLVED 33 YEARS LATER

12:39.333 --> 12:42.708
Sometimes we make decisions in our lives
that we can never undo.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.750
My name isn't Aleksander.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.375
It's Boris.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.125
Boris Niewald.

12:59.291 --> 13:01.791
But it was an accident.
You have to believe me.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.666
I am not a murderer.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.625
What about Mom?

13:07.958 --> 13:09.541
Did Mom know about this?

13:19.125 --> 13:22.125
Your mother is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.458
She saved me from all that.

13:26.958 --> 13:29.333
And I never even told her the truth.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.166
Bartosz.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.916
I'm sorry.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.708
Charlotte.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.541
May I come in for a second?

14:00.333 --> 14:01.333
Thanks.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.500
I need to speak to Ulrich. Is he here?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.208
No. He's still in the shower.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.541
Could I maybe wait? It's important.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.291
How are you?

14:29.666 --> 14:30.958
Okay.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.625
And at home? Is everything fine?

14:41.916 --> 14:43.416
Now you listen to me...

14:44.208 --> 14:45.708
Ulrich belongs to me.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.458
And that's not going to change.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.458
Charlotte.

14:56.541 --> 14:59.333
-What are you doing here?
-I just wanted to show you something.

15:00.791 --> 15:02.583
Drop by with Peter sometime.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.958
We can all go out together.
While I still can.

15:12.291 --> 15:14.708
-Are you done in the bathroom?
-Of course.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.291
-What are you doing here?
-Your cell was off.

15:27.375 --> 15:30.708
Don't ever do this again.
Never come here uninvited.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.625
The microscopic examinations
of the two pennies are in.

15:37.375 --> 15:38.250
And...

15:39.250 --> 15:40.500
And?

15:41.416 --> 15:42.583
And what?

15:49.541 --> 15:51.875
WINDEN POLICE
EVIDENCE

15:51.958 --> 15:54.416
This is the penny I found in the bunker.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.833
And this is the penny Helge had on him.

15:59.125 --> 16:03.166
At first I thought it must be a mistake,
that the photos were labeled incorrectly.

16:04.583 --> 16:05.916
But this here,

16:06.416 --> 16:07.916
this little groove.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.541
It is exactly identical.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.666
I don't know how,
but it's one and the same coin.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.958
But this one here, Helge has had it
as long as I've known him.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.125
I know it makes no sense at all,

16:22.958 --> 16:24.125
but...

16:24.916 --> 16:25.916
But?

16:27.500 --> 16:28.958
It's as if the penny...

16:30.250 --> 16:32.666
had somehow traveled through time.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.000
-Where's Helge now?
-Still in pre-trial custody.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.375
Ulrich!

17:57.583 --> 17:59.375
Oh, you startled me.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.375
Where were you?

18:09.166 --> 18:10.666
Did you cut your hair?

18:15.708 --> 18:17.041
What happened?

18:25.416 --> 18:26.958
Do you believe in fate?

18:33.500 --> 18:34.958
I don't know.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.458
No.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.666
I believe we take our lives
into our own hands.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.541
That we decide which path we take.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.250
I know I...

19:05.666 --> 19:08.708
I'm probably the last person
you want to talk to, but...

19:11.250 --> 19:12.750
if you do want to...

19:14.500 --> 19:15.500
I'm here.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.291
Your dad and I...

19:28.750 --> 19:30.916
A lot of things may be different now...

19:36.375 --> 19:38.708
but that doesn't necessarily mean
it's bad.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.750
No, it doesn't.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.708
Are you going somewhere?

20:19.791 --> 20:22.291
I promised someone
I'd take care of something.

20:36.416 --> 20:39.708
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

20:42.416 --> 20:44.875
GOD PARTICLE

20:45.000 --> 20:48.791
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

21:58.375 --> 21:59.375
Stop!

22:14.083 --> 22:15.250
Jonas.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.625
You're alive.

22:33.375 --> 22:34.916
I killed him.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.625
Why is he still alive in his world?

22:49.125 --> 22:50.541
The switch point...

22:52.458 --> 22:54.916
at the junction in the loop of time.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.708
<i>The moment</i>

23:02.416 --> 23:06.458
<i>that allows things to run</i>
<i>in one direction or the other.</i>

23:09.250 --> 23:10.958
<i>You bring him to our world,</i>

23:11.750 --> 23:13.166
or you don't.

23:15.625 --> 23:20.458
A line that meets itself again in a loop.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.125
<i>Two possible paths:</i>

23:25.041 --> 23:29.333
<i>along the outer edge of the line,</i>
<i>or along the inner edge of the line.</i>

23:30.708 --> 23:32.875
<i>And yet it is the same line.</i>

23:34.666 --> 23:37.125
<i>Two overlapping realities.</i>

23:42.125 --> 23:44.333
On one of these paths, he dies.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.208
On the other, he doesn't.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.875
Both possibilities recur in the loop

23:53.458 --> 23:55.791
again and again.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.250
One triggers the other.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.541
Quantum entanglement.

24:08.958 --> 24:14.083
Adam has tried to sever
this entanglement for the past 33 years,

24:15.166 --> 24:17.125
so what is growing inside you

24:17.208 --> 24:19.000
will never come to be.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.625
But it is impossible.

24:26.416 --> 24:27.708
Our worlds

24:28.666 --> 24:30.916
cannot be separated from one another.

24:32.208 --> 24:35.291
Every step Jonas takes is guided by us.

24:36.458 --> 24:38.750
He cannot escape his fate.

24:43.166 --> 24:44.583
What is this?

24:47.833 --> 24:49.375
This was left over...

24:50.958 --> 24:52.541
after the catastrophe.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.833
The God Particle.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.708
And this here?

25:04.208 --> 25:05.541
What is this?

25:09.750 --> 25:11.875
I've seen what it will become,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.375
in the future.

25:14.583 --> 25:18.500
There's no way back now.
The cave collapsed. There's nothing left.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.500
The passage no longer exists.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.916
But this here...

25:22.666 --> 25:25.291
if I find out how it works, I can go back.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.541
Then I can save them. Martha and Mikkel.

25:28.291 --> 25:29.958
I can save them all.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.208
How did you even find me?

25:41.666 --> 25:43.583
How did you know I was here?

25:46.916 --> 25:48.041
The device.

25:48.875 --> 25:52.125
-The matter it needs--
-The device. Do you still have it?

25:53.250 --> 25:54.250
Where is it?

26:10.416 --> 26:11.583
It doesn't work.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.958
Maybe it all had to happen this way first,

26:17.125 --> 26:19.458
for things to change next time.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.083
The substance in the device,

26:24.958 --> 26:27.750
you and I brought it
into the passage again.

26:29.458 --> 26:31.875
We changed the variables of the equation.

26:32.875 --> 26:36.583
-Maybe it will work next time.
-I don't have time to wait 33 years!

26:38.291 --> 26:41.041
Am I supposed to lie to myself again
to have things happen the same way?

26:41.541 --> 26:44.208
But this time I'll be on the other side
of the bunker door?

26:52.666 --> 26:54.041
Why didn't she say anything?

26:54.875 --> 26:56.291
Your older self.

26:59.041 --> 27:00.666
She knew Martha would die.

27:02.458 --> 27:03.875
How she'd die.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.625
Why should I trust you?

27:13.458 --> 27:15.166
The matter in the nuclear power plant.

27:18.166 --> 27:19.583
I know what it is.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.250
I can help you save Martha,

27:27.625 --> 27:28.708
to save them all.

27:31.541 --> 27:36.291
3 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

27:46.500 --> 27:47.625
Bartosz?

27:57.083 --> 27:58.166
Martha?

28:00.750 --> 28:01.750
Can I come in?

28:03.708 --> 28:04.791
Yes.

28:08.083 --> 28:11.000
33 years ago, there was an accident
at the nuclear power plant.

28:11.416 --> 28:15.416
Somehow the accident caused
some strange substance to form.

28:16.333 --> 28:19.541
And your father helped
cover everything up.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.958
The whole time,
that stuff has been in the caves.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.791
It's all connected.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.583
The substance...

28:32.958 --> 28:34.333
it triggers it.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.041
Today.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.125
We have to talk to him.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.708
Triggers what?

28:42.791 --> 28:44.375
The apocalypse.

28:47.583 --> 28:51.291
POLICE

28:51.375 --> 28:53.125
IDENTITY UNKNOWN

28:54.333 --> 28:58.041
The time of death must have been
just before the body was found.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.625
Is it possible
that he's been dead for a long time?

29:15.291 --> 29:17.500
That his body had been preserved somehow?

29:18.666 --> 29:20.083
Preserved?

29:20.166 --> 29:22.041
What do you mean "preserved"?

29:34.416 --> 29:35.750
Everything okay?

29:36.166 --> 29:38.000
The scar on his chin...

29:44.375 --> 29:45.375
Ulrich?

30:13.291 --> 30:14.916
The boy in the bunker.

30:15.833 --> 30:17.625
You said you killed him.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.250
But you didn't mean him.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.166
You meant Mads.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.666
The boy from the bunker
looks just like Mads.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.000
How can that be?

30:31.083 --> 30:34.250
She... she said I had to do it.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.125
Who?

30:38.208 --> 30:39.625
Do what?

30:40.291 --> 30:41.958
Send him to the future.

30:42.625 --> 30:44.375
To fill the gaps.

31:00.625 --> 31:01.666
The pennies.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.875
What does this mean?

31:08.250 --> 31:10.666
-I have to stop him.
-Stop who?

31:14.125 --> 31:15.375
Stop who?

31:20.833 --> 31:22.000
You.

31:44.875 --> 31:46.291
You can go.

32:11.333 --> 32:13.958
<i>And this Jonas guy is dead now?</i>

32:16.833 --> 32:18.416
And you killed him.

32:20.541 --> 32:22.333
Well, not you, but...

32:23.333 --> 32:24.958
some other you?

32:26.875 --> 32:28.291
I was there.

32:29.125 --> 32:30.583
In the future.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.375
Nothing's left.

32:37.291 --> 32:38.291
Nothing.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.875
It all has something to do
with your father.

32:42.458 --> 32:44.541
He can't be allowed to open the barrels.

32:50.583 --> 32:51.750
Bartosz.

32:53.875 --> 32:54.916
Please.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.291
Charlotte, it's Aleksander.

33:49.750 --> 33:50.916
I...

33:51.916 --> 33:53.791
Can you come to the nuclear power plant?

33:55.583 --> 33:57.291
I want to show you something.

35:08.541 --> 35:09.958
Come on out!

35:11.041 --> 35:12.583
Adam's waiting for you.

35:30.375 --> 35:31.416
Stop.

35:41.583 --> 35:42.625
Take it off!

35:43.750 --> 35:45.458
-What?
-Your clothing.

35:46.458 --> 35:47.458
Take it all off.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.166
Why are you doing as he says?

36:00.666 --> 36:02.833
We, the chosen few, must fill the gaps.

36:03.541 --> 36:06.250
So you can find your way here,
and Adam his...

36:07.166 --> 36:09.166
and we'll finally find salvation.

36:17.416 --> 36:20.333
We have waited
a long time for this moment.

36:26.416 --> 36:28.625
You know what to do.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.416
1 HOUR UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

36:54.500 --> 36:57.000
What do you think it means?

36:57.875 --> 37:00.083
The birds? The light?

37:00.166 --> 37:01.958
The boy in the bunker?

37:02.958 --> 37:05.333
Martha is losing it.

37:06.291 --> 37:10.208
She thinks
the apocalypse will happen today.

37:22.375 --> 37:27.708
If we die today, then together.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.541
Together.

37:54.541 --> 37:55.958
What's this about?

38:00.125 --> 38:02.166
It's better if you see it yourself.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.541
Tick, tock.

38:09.791 --> 38:11.833
Tick, tock.

38:15.666 --> 38:16.875
Tick...

38:17.333 --> 38:18.416
tock.

38:32.125 --> 38:35.541
Charlotte, it's me.
Listen, the stuff with the pennies...

38:35.625 --> 38:39.791
I know it sounds crazy, but the same thing
happened with the body in the bunker.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.125
Have them run a DNA test.

38:42.208 --> 38:43.875
I don't know how, but...

38:44.166 --> 38:45.625
the boy in the bunker,

38:46.041 --> 38:48.500
he's my brother. It's Mads.

38:49.541 --> 38:51.458
Call me back when you get this.

39:17.583 --> 39:18.916
Who are you?

39:21.833 --> 39:23.875
Can't you guess that?

39:32.458 --> 39:33.291
Magnus?

39:44.250 --> 39:45.708
You're from the future.

39:46.083 --> 39:47.500
But not from yours.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.666
What's going on?

39:51.625 --> 39:52.958
They lied to you.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.041
Your older selves.

39:55.875 --> 39:58.291
They don't want to prevent the apocalypse.

39:59.291 --> 40:02.583
They're the ones
who are responsible for it happening.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.041
But there is a way to change everything.

40:06.541 --> 40:08.875
But you have to choose our world...

40:09.708 --> 40:11.125
and trust him;

40:12.625 --> 40:13.458
Jonas.

40:16.041 --> 40:17.375
Jonas is alive?

40:19.375 --> 40:20.708
In our world.

40:22.125 --> 40:24.458
And he knows where the origin is.

40:26.500 --> 40:30.666
But before that, you must save Jonas
from the apocalypse in his world,

40:30.750 --> 40:32.791
and bring him into your world.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.833
You're all out of your minds.

40:36.791 --> 40:40.000
You can't stop
what's happening here, but...

40:41.083 --> 40:42.625
if you come with us,

40:43.291 --> 40:44.916
you can prevent it...

40:45.416 --> 40:46.916
another time.

40:50.166 --> 40:51.500
What is that?

41:05.541 --> 41:08.625
Martha, what's this all about?

41:12.916 --> 41:14.250
Martha?

41:17.583 --> 41:19.000
You have to come with us.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.916
-Come where?
-He doesn't belong with us.

41:23.583 --> 41:25.208
He belongs with the others.

41:28.791 --> 41:30.500
They will save him.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.083
I'm sorry.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.250
Martha, wait!

41:54.833 --> 41:56.416
<i>It's time.</i>

41:57.291 --> 42:01.333
<i>Adam has moved</i>
<i>each of his pieces into position.</i>

42:03.333 --> 42:04.583
It's time

42:05.291 --> 42:06.958
that we do the same.

42:11.125 --> 42:14.333
This knot has given us all life,

42:14.416 --> 42:16.875
and we are its keepers.

42:18.083 --> 42:19.666
In both worlds.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.541
He'll never be able

42:25.541 --> 42:27.250
to untie the knot.

42:28.416 --> 42:30.666
In all these years, he hasn't understood

42:30.750 --> 42:32.875
how everything is really connected.

42:33.833 --> 42:36.458
How everything ends and begins.

42:37.833 --> 42:39.625
Not only in our world,

42:40.750 --> 42:42.333
but also in his.

42:43.291 --> 42:45.333
We are...

42:46.166 --> 42:47.625
destiny.

42:49.125 --> 42:51.041
We build the walls...

42:51.708 --> 42:53.541
of this labyrinth.

42:53.625 --> 42:55.750
Each of us shapes the paths

42:55.833 --> 42:57.666
and extends their hand.

43:00.791 --> 43:05.250
Bartosz, you must save yourself
to save our lives.

43:05.916 --> 43:11.541
Claudia, you must guide yourself
to be our eyes in Adam's world.

43:11.666 --> 43:17.791
Egon, you must create your past
to preserve the family tree.

43:18.541 --> 43:19.583
Noah...

43:20.500 --> 43:22.291
you bring love

43:24.333 --> 43:26.416
to make everything new.

43:29.125 --> 43:31.875
Every darkness is followed by light.

43:31.958 --> 43:35.041
With every death comes a life.

44:01.333 --> 44:03.416
You brought me into your world.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.916
You promised me I could change it.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.666
Why are you doing this?

44:18.708 --> 44:20.208
Where are the others?

44:21.375 --> 44:23.041
Where did you send them?

44:25.041 --> 44:27.208
They are all fulfilling their destinies.

44:28.083 --> 44:30.083
Magnus and Franziska.

44:30.166 --> 44:31.958
Charlotte and Elisabeth.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.125
Silja and Agnes.

44:35.375 --> 44:37.666
They're perpetuating the cycle,

44:38.375 --> 44:41.083
so that you and I can be here now.

44:43.375 --> 44:45.083
What's that supposed to mean?

44:48.208 --> 44:50.125
That we've come to the end.

44:52.583 --> 44:54.041
What's growing inside you,

44:55.125 --> 44:56.250
the origin,

44:57.583 --> 44:59.208
must die.

45:00.583 --> 45:03.583
But it can't be killed by normal means.

45:04.541 --> 45:07.083
It's born of both worlds,

45:08.083 --> 45:10.500
and the energy of both worlds is necessary

45:11.083 --> 45:12.666
to destroy it.

45:13.666 --> 45:15.750
The apocalypse in my world,

45:16.833 --> 45:19.041
and the apocalypse in your world.

45:21.166 --> 45:23.458
This here is the end.

45:25.666 --> 45:29.250
A machine that not only crosses time,
but also space.

45:30.333 --> 45:33.208
It focuses the energy of both apocalypses

45:34.041 --> 45:36.875
onto this one point.

45:39.125 --> 45:41.083
Your son only exists

45:41.916 --> 45:43.875
because the matter exists.

45:44.333 --> 45:47.958
And now he will die through the matter,
and all of us with him.

45:48.041 --> 45:49.916
None of this...

45:50.708 --> 45:52.000
will exist anymore.

45:53.541 --> 45:56.833
Both worlds will extinguish one another.

45:58.875 --> 46:01.208
Absolute annihilation.

46:03.958 --> 46:05.458
You're insane.

46:17.958 --> 46:19.666
There is no hope.

46:20.625 --> 46:22.000
No salvation.

46:23.041 --> 46:24.458
No paradise.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.166
We're wrong,

46:36.291 --> 46:37.625
you and I...

46:41.083 --> 46:42.583
in your world

46:43.458 --> 46:44.958
and in mine.

Jonas.

46:52.916 --> 46:54.000
Jonas!

46:54.500 --> 46:56.083
Jonas, please don't do it.

46:56.625 --> 46:57.750
Jonas!

46:59.458 --> 47:00.458
Jonas!

47:01.250 --> 47:02.375

47:03.375 --> 47:05.291
Don't. Jonas, please!

Jonas!

47:09.958 --> 47:10.958
Jonas, please!

47:15.916 --> 47:17.125
No!

47:26.625 --> 47:28.166
