WEBVTT

00:00.384 --> 00:03.032
***

00:03.033 --> 00:05.550
But your son asked us if
we would take you in,

00:05.551 --> 00:07.598
and well, yes, we will take you in.

00:07.599 --> 00:09.048
If you're gonna do school
by yourself at home,

00:09.049 --> 00:11.457
then you're gonna have to do school
homework by yourself at home.

00:11.458 --> 00:12.389
I thought our mother might

00:12.390 --> 00:14.061
be able to help point me
in the right direction.

00:14.062 --> 00:15.975
I will drive you up there next weekend,

00:15.976 --> 00:17.658
and we can both have the weekend with her.

00:17.659 --> 00:19.591
To visit, not to do your homework.

00:19.592 --> 00:21.755
I'm thinking about getting married.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.724
You're gonna marry his old girlfriend?

00:24.725 --> 00:25.282
They're friends.

00:25.283 --> 00:27.700
They're not getting married.
We are if she says yes.

00:27.701 --> 00:29.933
Don't get married to Ben
just because you're pregnant

00:29.934 --> 00:32.347
and you like all the nice things
he does for you and the baby.

00:32.348 --> 00:34.391
You have to really love him to marry him.

00:34.392 --> 00:35.426
Well, he hasn't asked me.

00:35.427 --> 00:38.140
Ben's gonna ask Adrian to marry him?
I think so, Ruben, yeah.

00:38.141 --> 00:38.989
And if there's a wedding,

00:38.990 --> 00:40.667
it's whatever wedding the two of them want.

00:40.668 --> 00:41.388
I'm gay.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.502
I wish you'd have told me
before you told other people.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.626
I'm sorry. I wanna meet your girlfriend.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.837
Ben. I do love you,

00:51.983 --> 00:54.685
and I'd be honored if you'd be my wife.

00:54.796 --> 00:55.854
Yes.

01:01.325 --> 01:03.081
Married. They're getting married.

01:03.082 --> 01:05.087
Ridiculous.
Completely and totally ridiculous.

01:05.087 --> 01:06.945
They don't even know each other.
They never dated.

01:06.946 --> 01:08.029
They've never even been out.

01:08.030 --> 01:10.783
Or they hadn't been out
before Adrian got pregnant.

01:10.784 --> 01:11.515
And she only got pregnant

01:11.516 --> 01:13.263
because she was trying
to get back at Ricky.

01:13.264 --> 01:14.056
They're only getting married 'cause

01:14.057 --> 01:16.313
they're trying to beat
Ricky and me to the altar.

01:16.314 --> 01:18.400
I mean, really, Mom, can you believe it?

01:18.401 --> 01:20.432
Adrian and Ben. Adrian Boykewich.

01:20.433 --> 01:21.574
What kind of a name is that?

01:21.575 --> 01:22.877
I'll tell you what kind of a name it is.

01:22.878 --> 01:24.731
It's a name where the two
names do not belong together

01:24.732 --> 01:26.603
because the two people
don't belong together.

01:26.604 --> 01:28.052
I bet they have some ridiculous ceremony

01:28.053 --> 01:29.202
in the garden like Leo and Betty

01:29.203 --> 01:30.917
and invite the entire high school.

01:30.918 --> 01:32.143
Was that John?

01:33.424 --> 01:35.361
I think I heard John. I'll get him.

01:38.295 --> 01:39.552
I think it was Robie.

01:41.024 --> 01:42.871
I mean, if anyone should
be getting married,

01:42.872 --> 01:45.474
it should be Ricky and
me, not Adrian and Ben.

01:45.621 --> 01:48.144
Can't they at least wait
until the baby comes?

01:49.056 --> 01:51.133
Hello! Is anyone listening to me?

01:52.894 --> 01:55.092
Thank you. Mmm. A million times.

01:55.093 --> 01:56.345
Thank you for letting me do this.

01:56.346 --> 01:58.310
For letting me come over here.

01:58.311 --> 02:00.737
I really needed to get out of that house.

02:00.738 --> 02:01.869
I don't know how you did it.

02:01.870 --> 02:03.663
This really wasn't my idea.

02:03.734 --> 02:04.999
It was Amy's idea.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.557
And believe me, I know
what you two are up to.

02:07.564 --> 02:08.818
What are we up to?

02:09.894 --> 02:10.916
We're not up to anything.

02:10.917 --> 02:11.959
Yeah, you are.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.472
Ever since Ben and Adrian
announced their wedding plans,

02:14.473 --> 02:17.223
Amy's obsessed with the
idea of getting married.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.082
She's afraid that if left alone,

02:19.083 --> 02:21.355
I'll do something that prevents
us from ever getting married.

02:21.356 --> 02:23.520
But if she doesn't stop
talking about Ben and Adrian,

02:23.521 --> 02:24.611
I'm gonna start feeling pressured,

02:24.612 --> 02:27.716
and I'm gonna have to
do something about it.

02:28.161 --> 02:30.156
Oh, you're not gonna do something

02:30.157 --> 02:32.199
like sleep with other girls, are you?

02:32.912 --> 02:34.258
No, no, no, no.

02:34.259 --> 02:35.967
No, don't do... Amy...

02:35.968 --> 02:38.705
That girl loves you.
She really, really loves you.

02:38.706 --> 02:40.389
Yeah, and I care about her, too,

02:40.390 --> 02:43.081
but not enough to marry her
before Ben marries Adrian.

02:43.082 --> 02:46.193
Not even enough to marry her
before Ben divorces Adrian.

02:48.649 --> 02:50.811
Jeez, did you invite someone over here?

02:51.181 --> 02:54.079
No. I would never invite someone
over here without asking.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.578
I'm not rude. Jeez, I'm not a total loser.

02:57.231 --> 02:58.665
Invite someone over.

03:03.436 --> 03:05.063
Hi. I was in the neighborhood.

03:06.462 --> 03:08.437
No, you weren't. Hi there.

03:08.487 --> 03:09.328
Mmm.

03:09.329 --> 03:11.174
This is my mother. This is Nora.

03:11.175 --> 03:13.305
Nora, George. George, Nora.

03:13.306 --> 03:15.882
Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

03:16.181 --> 03:17.530
I hadn't heard you're hot.

03:18.178 --> 03:19.700
Well, hey, you're kind of hot yourself.

03:19.701 --> 03:20.852
Have a seat.

03:23.082 --> 03:25.081
Amy's visiting her mom this
weekend with her sister and John,

03:25.082 --> 03:26.497
but I guess you know that.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.340
Yeah, I kind of do know that.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.394
So, I really just came over

03:29.395 --> 03:31.409
here to make sure that
he's not cheating on Amy.

03:31.459 --> 03:32.786
Yeah. Me, too.

03:33.389 --> 03:36.521
Amy sent you over here?
She already sent her over here.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.360
Very thorough girl, that Amy.

03:38.361 --> 03:39.874
So, have you made

03:39.875 --> 03:42.344
a lot of friends since you've moved here?

03:42.345 --> 03:43.881
No, I can't say that I have.

03:43.882 --> 03:45.696
Yeah, I'm a little short of friends myself.

03:45.697 --> 03:47.160
Ever since Ann moved out,

03:47.161 --> 03:49.395
I really haven't had
another adult to talk to.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.018
Hmm. I'm kind of having
the opposite problem.

03:52.019 --> 03:54.011
I have way too many adults to talk to.

03:54.012 --> 03:56.892
Mm. I'm living with Margaret and Shakur.

03:57.536 --> 03:58.586
Do you know Margaret?

03:58.587 --> 03:59.582
Yeah, Margaret.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.529
Not my favorite person. No offense.

04:01.530 --> 04:03.118
Oh, none taken.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.211
You and me... we're gonna
get along just fine.

04:05.798 --> 04:08.249
I hope so. We could be family one day.

04:08.658 --> 04:10.019
Parents-in-law.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.671
Oh, jeez, I'm not even gonna think

04:11.672 --> 04:13.607
about getting married for years, okay?

04:13.608 --> 04:14.582
I'm not.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.987
Aah, don't be so sure.

04:15.988 --> 04:17.526
Yeah, don't be so sure.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.266
So... Hmm.

04:20.298 --> 04:21.769
...you're not dating anyone?

04:24.853 --> 04:25.361
No.

04:25.362 --> 04:26.362
Yeah, you are.

04:26.579 --> 04:28.739
You are? Is he a nice guy?

04:29.017 --> 04:30.868
Uh, not really.

04:30.869 --> 04:34.158
Nice guys aren't my type.
Why? Are you a nice guy?

04:34.159 --> 04:36.680
I can be. Or not.

04:36.826 --> 04:37.969
Yeah, okay.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.427
I'm not cheating on Amy. You can go now.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.606
Come on. Don't be so rude.
The man just got here.

04:42.607 --> 04:44.458
Yeah, the man just got here.

04:46.858 --> 04:48.676
And this is where our table would be.

04:48.677 --> 04:50.076
And then everything would be a circle.

04:50.077 --> 04:52.103
You know, just a big circle.

04:52.104 --> 04:53.482
Isn't that a great plan?

04:53.483 --> 04:55.561
I'm gonna go back and
say hi to Tom and Jack.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.192
I've seen this a few times.

04:57.350 --> 04:58.326
Okay.

04:59.475 --> 05:01.452
You know, like the circle of life.

05:01.453 --> 05:02.431
Uh-huh.

05:07.619 --> 05:08.815
God help me.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.457 --> 05:32.571
Or not a wedding like
she's planning anyway.

05:32.572 --> 05:33.851
I mean, I still haven't even told my dad

05:33.852 --> 05:35.683
that we're getting married
before the baby comes.

05:35.684 --> 05:38.473
He doesn't want us to get
married before the baby comes.

05:38.474 --> 05:41.590
I thought if we did that, we'd
just run off and get married.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.096
You know, just us and a few friends.

05:43.097 --> 05:44.538
Like your first wedding.

05:44.766 --> 05:48.177
That was my first date with Tammy.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.542
Yeah, exactly like my first wedding.

05:50.543 --> 05:51.520
That might be your problem.

05:51.521 --> 05:54.372
Adrian doesn't want a wedding
like your first wedding.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.305
Of course, that wasn't legal.

05:56.828 --> 05:59.272
This is gonna be legal and binding.

05:59.273 --> 06:00.557
I don't mind that...

06:00.698 --> 06:02.216
that it's legal and binding.

06:02.217 --> 06:04.104
I just... Oh, man.

06:04.105 --> 06:06.421
I don't want a huge wedding
with lots of people.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.803
Nor do I wanna pick out
the bridesmaids' dresses

06:09.804 --> 06:14.079
and the tuxedos and the linens
and the china patterns.

06:14.462 --> 06:15.625
I'm 17.

06:16.014 --> 06:19.713
I am barely 17, and I have a china pattern.

06:20.835 --> 06:24.101
Okay, we have a china pattern.
Like we even need china.

06:24.110 --> 06:24.842
Most of the time, we eat

06:24.843 --> 06:27.074
with our parents or at
the school cafeteria.

06:27.075 --> 06:29.651
Are you gonna live with your
parents or Adrian's parents?

06:29.652 --> 06:30.808
My parents.

06:31.192 --> 06:32.121
Really?

06:32.122 --> 06:33.380
I would assume so.

06:33.381 --> 06:35.123
I mean, we've certainly got
enough room at our house,

06:35.124 --> 06:37.007
and we've got help at our house, too.

06:37.008 --> 06:38.797
Yeah, but maybe Adrian
wants to live with her mom

06:38.798 --> 06:40.748
so her mom can help raise the baby.

06:40.749 --> 06:42.693
Her mom didn't even raise Adrian.

06:42.851 --> 06:44.926
We are not living at their house.

06:44.927 --> 06:47.482
I cannot live in the same
house as Adrian's parents.

06:47.483 --> 06:50.264
Am I in the wedding? Am I?

06:50.591 --> 06:52.104
Don't ask me. I don't know.

06:52.105 --> 06:53.363
What do you mean you don't know?

06:53.364 --> 06:54.876
The guy asks his friends
to be in the wedding,

06:54.877 --> 06:56.285
and the girl asks her friends.

06:56.286 --> 06:58.407
How many friends? No. Never mind.

06:58.408 --> 07:00.644
Don't answer that.
I already know the answer.

07:00.857 --> 07:02.576
As many friends as she wants.

07:02.577 --> 07:04.280
So I guess Henry's gonna be your best man?

07:04.281 --> 07:06.577
I think my dad will be my best man.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.026
Oh, if he's still speaking
to me once he finds out

07:09.027 --> 07:11.470
we're having a big wedding
before the baby gets here.

07:11.951 --> 07:13.765
Are you sure about that? Oh, yeah.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.826
Adrian spent all week making wedding plans.

07:15.827 --> 07:18.022
Already? And they settled on a date?

07:18.023 --> 07:20.639
Well, not the exact date,
but before the baby comes.

07:21.099 --> 07:23.064
All right. You win. I lose.

07:23.445 --> 07:24.537
Where's the wedding?

07:24.538 --> 07:27.301
I don't know, but the invitation
list is a mile long already,

07:27.302 --> 07:28.731
so it can't be here.

07:28.732 --> 07:31.447
I have been thinking maybe
here or at my church.

07:32.051 --> 07:35.208
Yeah, uh, I don't know
about a church, Ruben.

07:35.209 --> 07:37.617
I guess they could get married
at our house if they want.

07:37.618 --> 07:38.853
Maybe the wedding could be

07:38.854 --> 07:43.833
just a quiet civil ceremony
like Cindy and I had.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.158
With an invitation list a mile long?

07:46.648 --> 07:47.810
I don't know, Leo. I'm

07:47.811 --> 07:49.967
just happy Ben and Adrian
are getting married.

07:49.968 --> 07:51.962
I wish I could fly away from here

07:52.630 --> 07:54.286
and just keep flying.

07:54.472 --> 07:56.119
I just love flying.

07:56.558 --> 07:58.119
I fly back, Betty.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.877
I don't just fly away.

07:59.878 --> 08:02.181
Yeah, but if you wanted,
you could just fly away

08:02.304 --> 08:03.769
and just keep flying.

08:03.929 --> 08:06.898
I was just saying to Betty that
having a teenager daughter

08:06.899 --> 08:09.023
who's having a baby and getting married

08:09.024 --> 08:10.656
is a lot of pressure,

08:10.705 --> 08:13.456
so sometimes it's great to
just leave it all and...

08:13.457 --> 08:14.546
Fly away.

08:14.547 --> 08:18.057
I don't know why that just
sounds so good to me.

08:18.349 --> 08:20.719
Probably because having a
teenage son at the house

08:20.720 --> 08:22.859
who's getting married and having a baby

08:22.860 --> 08:24.613
is a lot of pressure for you, too.

08:24.614 --> 08:26.317
We're all under a lot of pressure.

08:26.318 --> 08:28.544
Guys, I know those two wanna get married,

08:28.545 --> 08:30.760
but I just think we should all think

08:30.761 --> 08:33.279
of about putting our money
into a small place for them

08:33.280 --> 08:35.578
rather than having them
live with either of us.

08:35.580 --> 08:36.828
How much money?

08:36.830 --> 08:39.323
Less money than this
wedding's gonna cost us.

08:39.506 --> 08:41.037
I think that's a good idea, Cindy.

08:41.038 --> 08:43.501
But Adrian wants Ben and the
baby to live here with us.

08:44.094 --> 08:47.498
And I'm sure Ben wants Adrian
and the baby to live with us.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.128
But I think it's best if they
live in a place of their own.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.918
I mean, they're having a baby.
They're getting married.

08:53.145 --> 08:54.607
Time to leave home if they can.

08:54.608 --> 08:57.776
Maybe we put a down payment
on a small condo for them.

08:57.777 --> 08:59.410
How much of a down payment?

08:59.920 --> 09:00.682
What the heck.

09:00.683 --> 09:01.380
I don't want them to leave

09:01.381 --> 09:03.622
school and work to make mortgage payments,

09:03.623 --> 09:06.806
so I'll buy them a small condo.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.353
If, and only if, it's a

09:08.354 --> 09:10.557
small wedding and a small
wedding reception.

09:10.558 --> 09:12.343
Because none of us want
to invest in a wedding.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.085
We wanna invest in them, right?

09:14.370 --> 09:15.532
Absolutely.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.393
That's very generous, Leo.

09:18.394 --> 09:20.932
But we'd like to contribute
to that small condo.

09:22.615 --> 09:26.709
I just hope that Adrian has
your decorating skills

09:26.773 --> 09:29.265
so she can make it a lovely
home for the three of them.

09:29.266 --> 09:31.104
Oh, thank you, Betty.

09:31.105 --> 09:32.544
I just wanna compliment you

09:32.545 --> 09:35.996
on just what a homey place this is.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.926
You know, I... I love the pictures

09:37.927 --> 09:40.602
of your grandfather in
the upstairs hallway.

09:40.603 --> 09:44.444
You know, it just gives you
such a sense of family history.

09:44.445 --> 09:46.787
That's not my grandfather.

09:47.105 --> 09:49.016
Those pictures belong to Ruben,

09:49.017 --> 09:52.503
and those pictures are of Jesus.

09:55.282 --> 09:59.555
Oh, well, such a family resemblance.

09:59.787 --> 10:01.143
Well, look at the time.

10:01.144 --> 10:02.889
I think we better get going, Betty.

10:02.890 --> 10:03.805
You know, if you wanna take

10:03.806 --> 10:05.812
one of Grandpa's pictures with you...

10:06.536 --> 10:09.444
Uh, we got a lot of artwork at the house,

10:09.445 --> 10:10.994
and plenty of it in storage.

10:11.646 --> 10:13.573
Uh, thanks, folks.

10:13.849 --> 10:16.981
We're happy we got to talk, and
thanks for inviting us over.

10:17.035 --> 10:20.185
Really? That's Jesus?

10:25.913 --> 10:27.438
You will be my maid of honor, right?

10:27.439 --> 10:29.513
I guess. I mean, yeah, if you want me to.

10:29.514 --> 10:31.491
You want to, right? Of course.

10:32.547 --> 10:33.712
Oh, there's Grant.

10:35.933 --> 10:36.945
Grant.

10:37.489 --> 10:38.150
Oh.

10:38.151 --> 10:40.243
I thought I'd just walk
out to the guest house

10:40.244 --> 10:42.525
if you two were still busy
with the wedding plans.

10:42.526 --> 10:44.207
And it looks like you're still busy, so...

10:44.208 --> 10:46.393
So come in. Come on.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.575
I want you to be a groomsman.

10:51.576 --> 10:53.839
And then you and Grace can
walk down the aisle together.

10:54.055 --> 10:56.572
Uh, I don't really know
Ben that well, do I?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.905
Yeah, isn't Ben supposed to
choose who the groomsmen are?

10:58.906 --> 11:01.420
Yeah. I think the groomsmen are
literally the groom's men.

11:01.421 --> 11:02.478
His friends.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.843
I'm not sure Ben considers
me a friend, does he?

11:04.844 --> 11:07.518
He has the one friend, Henry.

11:07.603 --> 11:10.593
Ooh, I gotta remember to call Henry.
And Alice.

11:10.594 --> 11:12.674
Okay, so, then, it'll be you and Grace,

11:12.675 --> 11:14.868
Henry and Alice, Jack and Madison...

11:14.869 --> 11:16.726
Ooh, Jack and Madison broke up.

11:16.727 --> 11:18.254
Oh, yeah. I know.

11:18.598 --> 11:20.851
Well, then, maybe I can put him with Lauren

11:20.852 --> 11:22.847
and Tom with Madison,

11:23.092 --> 11:24.444
and then Ashley and Griffin.

11:24.445 --> 11:26.234
Wouldn't it be Griffin and Peter?

11:26.235 --> 11:27.612
Well, then, who do I put Ashley with?

11:27.613 --> 11:29.177
Not with Grant.

11:30.652 --> 11:31.672
Okay, well,

11:31.673 --> 11:33.638
maybe Peter can bring someone,

11:33.639 --> 11:35.792
and then they could just
switch off for the wedding.

11:35.793 --> 11:37.217
I'll be right back. I have to pee again.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.287
No problem.

11:39.787 --> 11:42.042
Okay, I cannot hang out here
all night listening to this.

11:42.043 --> 11:44.228
I can't. I'm too young,
and life is too short.

11:44.229 --> 11:46.700
You can't leave me. Please don't leave me.

11:47.017 --> 11:49.260
Also, my mom and Jeff went
out of town for the night.

11:49.261 --> 11:51.434
She didn't wanna hear about the
wedding plans either, huh?

11:51.435 --> 11:53.280
Did you not hear what I just said?

11:54.181 --> 11:55.755
There's no one here,

11:56.329 --> 11:58.548
except for Tom and Jack, but
they're in the guest house.

11:58.549 --> 12:01.457
What does that mean? That you and I can...

12:01.753 --> 12:03.209
We can think about it.

12:03.210 --> 12:05.416
I can't not think about it at this point.

12:06.070 --> 12:09.494
I can't believe I didn't say Ricky and Amy.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.955
Of course we want Ricky and Amy
to be part of the wedding.

12:11.956 --> 12:12.753
Really?

12:12.754 --> 12:14.096
Really. I mean,

12:14.097 --> 12:16.602
we wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for them.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.195
Well, if you know what I mean.
We know what you mean.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.965
Oh, and then John could be the ring bearer.

12:21.966 --> 12:23.267
You think he could do it?

12:29.653 --> 12:31.354
How's six weeks from today?

12:31.560 --> 12:32.516
For?

12:32.623 --> 12:33.668
"For?"

12:34.321 --> 12:35.885
Ben, for the wedding.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.171
I mean, it's as much time
as we can give ourselves,

12:40.172 --> 12:41.524
'cause after that, we have midterms,

12:41.525 --> 12:43.200
and then you have SATs.

12:43.465 --> 12:44.742
So what do you think?

12:46.443 --> 12:47.427
Ben!

12:47.735 --> 12:48.753
Okay.

12:51.290 --> 12:52.325
Yay.

12:59.449 --> 13:01.011
Hey, Lauren, it's Jack.

13:01.970 --> 13:03.151
What do you want?

13:03.153 --> 13:04.107
And don't think that I'm

13:04.108 --> 13:05.749
not gonna tell Madison that you called me

13:05.750 --> 13:07.509
as soon as I get off this call.

13:07.510 --> 13:08.662
I don't want anything.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.480
But Adrian wants you and
Madison to be in her wedding.

13:11.601 --> 13:12.691
How do you know?

13:12.692 --> 13:15.007
She told Grace, and Grace told me and Tom.

13:15.008 --> 13:17.986
She's pairing you and me up
and Madison and Tom together.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.009
And since Madison broke up with me,

13:20.010 --> 13:20.775
I thought it'd be a little

13:20.776 --> 13:22.983
awkward if I was in the wedding with her,

13:22.984 --> 13:25.147
even if we're not walking in together.

13:25.646 --> 13:27.527
So I was thinking maybe I should call her.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.922
Do you think I should call her?

13:29.228 --> 13:30.210
What?

13:30.353 --> 13:33.540
Why would Madison and I be
in Adrian and Ben's wedding?

13:33.541 --> 13:35.249
Why not? She's asking everyone.

13:35.288 --> 13:37.044
"Everyone." Not everyone.

13:37.045 --> 13:39.372
I'm sure she's not asking Amy and Ricky.

13:39.373 --> 13:40.841
Yeah, she is. And John.

13:40.842 --> 13:43.257
What? I have to go.

13:50.745 --> 13:53.312
I'm bored out of my mind.
I've got to get a new boyfriend.

13:53.487 --> 13:54.945
Jack just called me.

13:55.053 --> 13:57.482
What? You can't go out with Jack,

13:57.483 --> 13:59.713
especially since I can't
go out with Stanley.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.303
I'm happy you can't go out with Stanley.

14:01.304 --> 14:02.937
I never liked Stanley.

14:03.137 --> 14:04.462
Jack called to tell me

14:04.463 --> 14:07.715
that Adrian is inviting you
and me to be in her wedding,

14:07.716 --> 14:09.740
and she wants you to walk
down the aisle with Tom,

14:09.741 --> 14:12.512
and she wants me to walk
down the aisle with Jack.

14:12.513 --> 14:13.739
Okay, I'm fine with Tom,

14:13.740 --> 14:15.846
but you cannot walk down
the aisle with Jack.

14:15.847 --> 14:18.961
Whatever. That's not the
craziest part of the ceremony.

14:18.962 --> 14:20.973
He said Adrian is inviting

14:20.974 --> 14:23.315
Amy and Ricky to be in the wedding.

14:24.650 --> 14:25.915
I think I'm gonna pass out.

14:25.916 --> 14:26.918
I know.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.393
Jack is calling me.

14:29.539 --> 14:31.157
Take it. No.

14:31.158 --> 14:32.173
Talk to him.

14:32.174 --> 14:33.868
Not unless you're gonna talk to Jesse.

14:33.869 --> 14:35.454
Jesse's not calling me.

14:35.455 --> 14:36.909
Jack is calling you.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.017
Take the call.

14:41.346 --> 14:43.700
Don't bother me.
I'm in a state of emergency.

14:43.701 --> 14:46.739
Adrian has lost her mind over this wedding.

14:47.007 --> 14:48.529
State of emergency.

14:49.502 --> 14:51.457
Dave would like to say good-bye to you.

14:51.927 --> 14:53.429
Bye. Have a nice time.

14:53.430 --> 14:55.709
Uh, Lauren, I'm leaving permanently.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.652
Oh? Yeah. Your mom and I are splitting up.

15:00.764 --> 15:01.445
What?

15:01.446 --> 15:02.430
Yeah.

15:02.570 --> 15:03.715
Are you sure?

15:03.723 --> 15:04.829
Oh, I'm sure.

15:04.830 --> 15:06.583
She's, uh, been wanting all of us

15:06.584 --> 15:09.450
to sit down and have
dinner and talk, but...

15:10.494 --> 15:12.338
Honestly, I'm a surgeon.

15:12.339 --> 15:13.480
I'm not much of a talker.

15:13.481 --> 15:15.781
I don't wanna talk about my
problems with the two of you.

15:16.199 --> 15:17.071
I don't wanna go to counseling.

15:17.072 --> 15:19.370
I myself am not a big fan of psychotherapy.

15:19.371 --> 15:22.150
No... No offense to your father.

15:22.471 --> 15:23.660
None taken.

15:23.661 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, I believe in surgically
removing the problem,

15:27.001 --> 15:29.592
clean and simple, and in
this case, I'm the problem,

15:29.593 --> 15:31.686
so I'm leaving.

15:31.687 --> 15:33.122
Well, wait. I mean...

15:34.326 --> 15:35.618
I don't know what to say.

15:36.113 --> 15:38.998
I guess I've just been so involved
with my problems with Jesse,

15:38.999 --> 15:41.386
I didn't even realize you and Mom were...

15:41.387 --> 15:42.378
Unhappy.

15:42.954 --> 15:45.423
Lauren, I just want you to know

15:45.424 --> 15:47.517
that our unhappiness has nothing to do

15:47.518 --> 15:49.192
with the fact that I'm white.

15:49.765 --> 15:53.266
Okay. But it seems kind of sudden.

15:53.305 --> 15:54.847
No, no. It's been about six months

15:54.848 --> 15:55.847
since your mother first came

15:55.848 --> 15:57.997
and talked to me and
said she wanted me out.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.317
So I wanna say good-bye, and, um,

16:00.648 --> 16:02.631
we can stay in touch, and maybe we can

16:03.419 --> 16:04.900
hang out once in a while.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.868
Oh, and, uh, before I leave,
I wanna give you kids this.

16:09.869 --> 16:13.173
Um, I'm not your real father,

16:13.481 --> 16:17.279
but, uh, that's real money,

16:17.669 --> 16:20.258
and, uh, I want you to have it.

16:22.045 --> 16:24.326
I don't have children of my own,
but I've got a lot of that.

16:30.044 --> 16:31.131
You think this is real?

16:31.132 --> 16:32.365
I think it's a real check,

16:32.366 --> 16:33.811
but it's never gonna be real money.

16:33.812 --> 16:35.814
Dad is not gonna let us take this.

16:36.881 --> 16:38.206
Unless you ask him.

16:38.819 --> 16:40.795
I'm not gonna ask him. You ask him.

16:40.796 --> 16:41.749
You're his favorite.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.675
Oh, I have to text Amy.

16:44.783 --> 16:46.914
You know, now that I think about it,

16:47.710 --> 16:50.140
Dave might have done
this just to annoy Dad.

16:50.641 --> 16:51.775
At least that's what you should tell him,

16:51.776 --> 16:53.467
and then maybe we can keep this.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.886
I'm not talking to Dad.

17:00.550 --> 17:01.607
Seriously, Amy.

17:01.608 --> 17:03.656
It says here that only
40% of teen marriages

17:03.657 --> 17:05.330
last more than five years.

17:06.011 --> 17:08.564
Ashley, stop that.
Amy, you listening to me?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.999
Hmm? Amy, I looked this up,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.220
because I wanna be involved in
the things that you care about.

17:13.221 --> 17:14.597
Are you even listening to me?

17:15.428 --> 17:17.090
Oh, my God, Mom. I have to go.

17:17.221 --> 17:18.534
What? What happened?

17:18.771 --> 17:19.736
Bye.

17:20.436 --> 17:21.709
Amy, what's going on?

17:21.921 --> 17:24.234
Um, Lauren's parents split up.

17:24.425 --> 17:25.401
And?

17:25.496 --> 17:27.844
And they split up. She's devastated.

17:28.346 --> 17:29.818
You're talking about Lauren's mother

17:29.819 --> 17:31.675
and her stepfather, right?

17:31.689 --> 17:33.398
Yeah, they've been married for years.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.519
I didn't even know that Lauren
was close to her stepfather.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.638
Mom, it's still a big change in her life.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.261
I'm just gonna drive home,
and I'll check on her,

17:39.262 --> 17:40.234
and I'll come back tomorrow.

17:40.235 --> 17:41.819
And John will be where?

17:43.774 --> 17:44.770
No.

17:45.761 --> 17:47.693
Amy, this is our weekend together.

17:47.782 --> 17:49.109
We're not doing anything.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.956
Yes, we are. We're...

17:51.688 --> 17:55.017
We're...spending time together.

17:55.018 --> 17:56.443
Well, couldn't you spend
time alone with Ashley?

17:56.444 --> 17:58.119
She needs you more than I do.

17:59.113 --> 18:00.399
That's not the point.

18:01.678 --> 18:03.020
I can be back by noon tomorrow.

18:03.021 --> 18:04.681
But you just got here at noon today.

18:04.682 --> 18:06.571
You can't drive there and drive back here.

18:06.572 --> 18:07.379
And anyway, I don't want you

18:07.380 --> 18:09.040
driving by yourself on
the freeway at night.

18:09.041 --> 18:11.350
It's a two-hour drive.
All right. All right.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.483
I'll go with her. No.
You two are not going anywhere.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.843
You are staying right here,
and we are going to have fun

18:16.844 --> 18:18.547
because it's our weekend together.

18:18.548 --> 18:19.518
And I know what this is about,

18:19.519 --> 18:21.834
Amy. This is not about Lauren, is it?

18:22.215 --> 18:24.493
Adrian is inviting me and
Ricky to be in their wedding.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.143
She wants us in their wedding.
It should be our wedding.

18:27.144 --> 18:29.282
And so what?
So you're just gonna rush back there

18:29.283 --> 18:32.473
and try to get Ricky to marry you
before Adrian can marry Ben?

18:33.413 --> 18:36.087
And how are you gonna do that?
By having sex with him?

18:36.180 --> 18:38.901
You sent your father over there
tonight to check up on him.

18:38.902 --> 18:42.233
He told me. Yeah, we still
talk... your father and me.

18:42.234 --> 18:44.775
And I've got news for you.
If you can't trust Ricky,

18:44.776 --> 18:48.377
you shouldn't marry Ricky, even
if Adrian is marrying Ben.

18:49.386 --> 18:51.630
Okay. Now we're having fun.

18:58.486 --> 19:00.880
All right. I should, uh... I
should probably get home.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.228
Mmm, I don't think so.

19:04.646 --> 19:06.387
I don't think you need to get home.

19:06.708 --> 19:09.386
I think you need to get upstairs

19:09.472 --> 19:12.186
to my bedroom with me.

19:12.554 --> 19:13.991
And do what?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.543
You know what.

19:15.805 --> 19:16.722
Oh.

19:17.436 --> 19:19.223
Oh, um,

19:19.557 --> 19:20.575
no.

19:20.664 --> 19:22.951
Oh, oh, yes.

19:23.235 --> 19:25.848
Dr. Attavi said it would be
fine if we wanna do that.

19:26.327 --> 19:29.059
Adrian, I don't think we
should do that until...

19:29.538 --> 19:30.650
The wedding night?

19:31.342 --> 19:33.207
I'm marrying you, and, well,

19:33.208 --> 19:34.736
sex is a healthy part of marriage.

19:34.737 --> 19:36.372
We're not married yet.

19:36.645 --> 19:38.534
But we're gonna get married, so...

19:38.535 --> 19:41.596
So I'm not prepared to
have sex with you tonight.

19:41.819 --> 19:44.696
I'm... I'm not... I'm not
emotionally prepared.

19:45.658 --> 19:47.166
Is it the baby?

19:47.969 --> 19:50.452
Is it my big baby belly?

19:50.453 --> 19:53.239
'Cause I think I look
really pretty like this.

19:53.266 --> 19:54.867
I mean, I feel really pretty like this,

19:54.868 --> 19:57.780
and I feel like having sex like this.

19:57.945 --> 19:59.780
I'm just... I'm happy,

19:59.781 --> 20:01.999
and I wanna share my
happiness with you, okay?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.471
I wanna share myself with
you tonight, right now.

20:04.472 --> 20:06.240
Adrian, we can't. We just can't.

20:06.241 --> 20:09.859
Um, look, I can't anyway.
But maybe sometime in the future?

20:10.512 --> 20:11.216
"Maybe"?

20:11.217 --> 20:14.272
No, definitely.
No, definitely sometime in the future.

20:14.273 --> 20:16.640
Just not tonight, okay? I gotta go home.

20:27.758 --> 20:28.976
Where did you hear that?

20:29.009 --> 20:30.377
Where do I hear everything?

20:30.392 --> 20:32.383
Grace told Jack, and then
this time, Jack told Lauren,

20:32.384 --> 20:34.529
and then Lauren told Madison,
and Madison told me.

20:34.708 --> 20:36.523
I'm not gonna be in that wedding,
and John is not going to be

20:36.524 --> 20:38.741
a ring bearer in anyone's wedding but ours.

20:38.742 --> 20:39.983
I don't really care.

20:39.987 --> 20:40.775
I care.

20:40.776 --> 20:43.039
Amy, would you just calm
down about this wedding?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.513
Calm down. I can't, all right?

20:44.514 --> 20:46.584
I cannot calm down.
I'm really, really upset

20:46.585 --> 20:48.176
that they would get married before us.

20:48.177 --> 20:50.217
We're too young to get married. All of us.

20:50.218 --> 20:52.784
We're too young. No, we're not.
We're not too young.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.835
I'm just getting used
to the idea of dating.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.779
I'm not gonna get used

20:55.780 --> 20:58.281
to the idea of getting
married anytime soon.

21:03.786 --> 21:06.576
She can carve a small handgun
out of a bar of soap.

21:06.655 --> 21:08.215
I could fall in love with this woman.

21:08.216 --> 21:10.309
Yeah. But it wouldn't do you any good.

21:10.641 --> 21:11.849
I'll be back.

21:13.157 --> 21:14.581
Aren't we supposed to be watching him?

21:15.198 --> 21:17.822
Yeah. I was never really good at that.

21:18.497 --> 21:20.510
Hey, what'd he mean by that...
wouldn't do me any good?

21:20.511 --> 21:21.864
I mean, I'm not trying to
hit on you or anything.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.355
But you're not so serious about

21:23.356 --> 21:25.115
this guy that you'd be
getting married, are you?

21:25.116 --> 21:26.860
I mean, you just got out.

21:27.073 --> 21:29.281
You gotta enjoy your freedom a
little bit, don't you think?

21:29.565 --> 21:31.075
Yeah, I guess.

21:31.076 --> 21:32.872
I think you're a really interesting woman.

21:33.002 --> 21:35.027
I don't think I've ever met
anyone who's been to prison.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.578
Oh, you probably have.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.675
Maybe.

21:38.599 --> 21:40.873
So, do you wanna take me home?

21:41.653 --> 21:42.730
Home?

21:42.946 --> 21:44.020
Meaning...

21:45.386 --> 21:47.417
Margaret's house. I've got a curfew.

21:47.772 --> 21:50.187
Oh. As long as I don't
have to go inside, sure.

21:50.303 --> 21:51.934
But if we leave, who's gonna watch Ricky?

21:52.256 --> 21:54.832
Oh, that dog's off the leash, I'm afraid.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.377
Jeez, I forgot about Moose.

21:56.378 --> 21:57.467
We have a dog.

21:57.636 --> 21:59.011
Oh, lucky.

21:59.012 --> 22:01.316
I want one. I've always wanted a dog.

22:01.659 --> 22:04.316
I'll let you meet Moose sometime.
You'll change your mind.

22:10.727 --> 22:13.281
Lauren? Oh, no.

22:15.376 --> 22:18.064
Jason called. He told me what happened.

22:18.458 --> 22:19.812
That big mouth.

22:19.873 --> 22:21.840
Did he just call you out of the blue?

22:22.107 --> 22:24.076
Not exactly. Your mother called him

22:24.077 --> 22:26.236
to tell him she might be a
little late getting home.

22:26.705 --> 22:28.754
From where? Where was she?

22:28.844 --> 22:31.519
My point is, Jason did the right thing

22:31.520 --> 22:34.450
by telling your mother and
then me about what happened.

22:34.689 --> 22:36.882
He thought you might
need someone to talk to.

22:37.152 --> 22:38.528
Oh, did he now?

22:38.781 --> 22:41.624
And where did you say Mom was?

22:41.680 --> 22:43.535
Was she with you?

22:43.536 --> 22:46.166
With me? Was she with me?

22:46.354 --> 22:47.541
Was she?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.438
We had a cup of coffee.

22:49.519 --> 22:52.224
She needed to talk.
Do you need someone to talk to?

22:52.625 --> 22:56.041
No, I'm good. Talk about what?

22:56.596 --> 22:57.289
Well, Lauren,

22:57.290 --> 22:59.959
this is a pretty big change in your life

22:59.960 --> 23:01.747
and in Jason's life...

23:01.748 --> 23:04.021
Dave moving out of the house.

23:04.945 --> 23:06.656
And it's a big change for your mother.

23:06.772 --> 23:09.426
Yeah, and apparently for you, too.

23:09.565 --> 23:12.598
The last time I saw you with a
beard, you were living here.

23:13.557 --> 23:15.091
Mom likes beards.

23:15.092 --> 23:18.405
And you just had coffee with Mom?

23:19.138 --> 23:21.890
Oh, don't sit down, please. Don't sit down.

23:22.996 --> 23:24.623
Which one of your friends are you texting?

23:24.624 --> 23:27.137
Who's more important than your own father?

23:27.872 --> 23:29.054
Did Jason tell you

23:29.055 --> 23:31.983
that Dave left him a big,
fat check before he left?

23:32.180 --> 23:33.198
No.

23:33.199 --> 23:34.180
Yeah. Uh-huh.

23:34.256 --> 23:36.069
I figured he didn't mention that.

23:36.194 --> 23:37.537
He's been sucking up to Dave

23:37.538 --> 23:40.019
ever since he decided to go to med school.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.115
Evidently it paid off, big-time.

23:43.116 --> 23:47.918
So you might want to sit down
on Jason's bed and talk to him.

23:48.148 --> 23:51.042
Yeah. Maybe I do.

24:01.252 --> 24:03.588
Ben, we have to talk.

24:04.681 --> 24:06.758
Now? I've had a long, stressful day.

24:06.759 --> 24:08.319
I was just... I was going to sleep.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.305
You're not going to sleep. We have to talk.

24:10.625 --> 24:13.025
You and Adrian cannot get married.

24:19.022 --> 24:19.974
Go on.

24:22.189 --> 24:23.980
How did you get yourself into this?

24:24.293 --> 24:25.844
How'd I get myself into this?

24:26.068 --> 24:28.052
The same way you got yourself into this.

24:28.173 --> 24:30.553
Yeah, well, I'm not getting married.

24:30.554 --> 24:32.797
And if and when I do, I'm
not having a big wedding.

24:34.185 --> 24:35.336
I'm sure that...

24:36.400 --> 24:38.847
every man who's ever gotten
married has said just that.

24:38.884 --> 24:40.642
So you might as well give
in to it, my friend.

24:40.643 --> 24:43.024
Might as well. No, no.
Not "I might as well."

24:43.025 --> 24:45.012
I'm not gonna get married
until I'm really sure

24:45.013 --> 24:46.772
I wanna be married for the rest of my life.

24:46.773 --> 24:49.043
And I'm in no hurry to decide that,

24:49.044 --> 24:51.032
and you don't have to be
in a big hurry either.

24:51.401 --> 24:53.036
I don't know why you don't get married.

24:53.111 --> 24:55.349
I mean, you can't cheat on Amy now.

24:55.387 --> 24:57.248
You might want to, but you can't.

24:57.249 --> 24:59.321
Amy Juergens is the last girl on earth

24:59.322 --> 25:02.287
you're gonna have sex with,
so why don't you marry her?

25:02.389 --> 25:05.234
Besides, she's already in love
with you, and she had your baby.

25:05.235 --> 25:06.888
Are you gonna tell the
woman who had your baby

25:06.889 --> 25:07.517
that you're not in love

25:07.518 --> 25:09.212
with her and you're never gonna marry her?

25:09.221 --> 25:11.527
No, you're not, so you're stuck.

25:11.528 --> 25:12.877
Just like me, you're stuck.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.675
I'm not stuck, and neither are you.

25:14.676 --> 25:16.816
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to get married,

25:16.817 --> 25:18.959
and you certainly don't have
to get married right away.

25:19.045 --> 25:20.996
You could at least think
about it for a while.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.479
I don't like to think
about things too much.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.691
I'm more decisive than you are.

25:23.692 --> 25:26.149
And I actually wanna get married.
To Adrian?

25:26.320 --> 25:28.834
Yes, to Adrian, to the mother of my baby.

25:28.913 --> 25:30.914
And if she weren't the mother of your baby?

25:31.243 --> 25:32.492
Then I would not be getting married.

25:32.493 --> 25:35.087
But she is the mother of my
baby, and I am getting married.

25:35.088 --> 25:36.795
Just a little sooner than I wanted

25:36.796 --> 25:39.251
and in a much bigger
ceremony than I wanted.

25:39.252 --> 25:41.135
Just wait. Just get her to wait.

25:41.136 --> 25:43.626
Wait at least until after the baby comes.

25:43.696 --> 25:45.767
Things are gonna change
after the baby comes.

25:45.768 --> 25:48.628
She doesn't wanna wait until
after the baby comes.

25:48.677 --> 25:49.591
She wants to be married

25:49.592 --> 25:51.449
when we go to the hospital
to have the baby.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.963
And I understand that.
Amy wanted that, too, you know?

25:54.247 --> 25:56.106
I mean, that's why Amy and I
ended up getting married,

25:56.107 --> 25:58.512
because she wanted to be
married when the baby came.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.163
Well, you can't just marry every girl

26:00.164 --> 26:02.432
who wants to get married
before the baby comes.

26:02.433 --> 26:04.047
No, not every girl.

26:04.048 --> 26:05.904
Just one girl.

26:05.917 --> 26:08.317
I asked Adrian to marry
me, and she said yes,

26:08.318 --> 26:11.838
and we're getting married, and
when and where are her decisions.

26:11.839 --> 26:14.295
Why are you letting her make
all the decisions, huh?

26:14.296 --> 26:16.686
Adrian shouldn't be
making all the decisions.

26:16.693 --> 26:18.476
You should be making the
decisions with her.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.420
Even making some of the
decisions all by yourself.

26:21.527 --> 26:23.718
Is that a totally foreign concept to you?

26:23.941 --> 26:25.208
It's your life, too, Ben.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.988
"Too," Yes. It's my life, too.

26:26.989 --> 26:29.063
It's also Adrian's life
and the baby's life.

26:29.064 --> 26:31.559
And why are you so upset
about our lives anyway?

26:31.560 --> 26:34.202
Because, obviously, your
lives are affecting my life

26:34.203 --> 26:36.251
and Amy's life and now John's life.

26:36.610 --> 26:39.597
Adrian wants our son to be
ring bearer at this circus,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.740
and she wants Amy to be a bridesmaid.

26:41.752 --> 26:44.939
She wants me to be whatever
the guys are in the wedding.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.055
Really?

26:46.056 --> 26:47.380
Yeah, really.

26:48.086 --> 26:48.639
Okay, well,

26:48.640 --> 26:50.645
then I guess that's what's gonna happen.

26:50.673 --> 26:53.137
And what if Amy doesn't want
John to be ring bearer?

26:54.633 --> 26:55.991
Are you guys actually arguing

26:55.992 --> 26:58.377
about who's gonna be the
ring bearer at the wedding?

26:59.297 --> 27:00.369
Yeah.

27:00.489 --> 27:02.507
And I heard you were getting
married before the baby comes,

27:02.508 --> 27:03.931
and I heard it from Ruben.

27:04.189 --> 27:05.964
I don't like hearing things from Ruben.

27:06.330 --> 27:08.202
I like hearing things from my own son.

27:10.565 --> 27:11.941
You have anything else?

27:12.840 --> 27:13.654
Yeah.

27:13.655 --> 27:14.918
I have something else.

27:15.460 --> 27:16.677
I know Adrian,

27:16.967 --> 27:18.886
and I know her really well.

27:19.577 --> 27:22.320
I know she's a really nice
girl, and she's funny,

27:22.616 --> 27:24.616
and she's smart, she's sexy.

27:25.445 --> 27:27.060
She's gonna make a great mom.

27:27.159 --> 27:29.956
She loves kids, and she'll love this kid.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.641
But she has some picture in her head

27:33.642 --> 27:36.116
of a mom and a dad and
a baby living together

27:36.117 --> 27:38.120
and being one big happy family.

27:38.121 --> 27:41.703
And having a baby in high school
is not a big, happy thing.

27:42.432 --> 27:44.068
It's just not.

27:44.319 --> 27:46.552
And getting married is not gonna
make it a big, happy thing,

27:46.553 --> 27:48.538
even if you two really love each other.

27:49.596 --> 27:50.702
Even if.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.522
So I'm speaking to you as your friend,

27:53.568 --> 27:55.627
and I'm telling you what
you don't want to hear.

27:56.741 --> 27:58.213
Wait to get married.

27:59.156 --> 28:00.581
Tell Adrian you wanna wait to get married.

28:00.582 --> 28:03.502
Because I know you wanna
wait to get married.

28:03.503 --> 28:04.814
So just do that.

28:05.115 --> 28:07.579
Take control, would you? Good night.

28:13.541 --> 28:14.816
I don't know what he wants me to do.

28:14.817 --> 28:16.719
I mean, I already asked her to marry me,

28:16.720 --> 28:18.419
and we're getting married,

28:18.420 --> 28:22.400
and we are getting married in six weeks.

28:22.804 --> 28:24.741
Oy vey. Six weeks?

28:25.495 --> 28:26.372
Yeah, oy vey.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.357
But, I mean, that's what she wants.

28:28.884 --> 28:30.479
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

28:30.480 --> 28:32.286
Yeah, I'm sure I wanna go through with it.

28:32.287 --> 28:34.980
I wanna get married anyway. But I just...

28:35.080 --> 28:37.624
I don't see why we have to make
such a big deal out of it.

28:38.468 --> 28:39.765
It's a big deal.

28:40.057 --> 28:41.639
It's one of the biggest deals.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.306
I know. I just don't know why

28:43.307 --> 28:45.255
we have to have such a huge wedding.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.733
It seems ridiculous being our age

28:47.734 --> 28:50.384
and being pregnant and
having a huge wedding.

28:50.528 --> 28:53.215
On the other hand, I'm not going
to not have a huge wedding

28:53.216 --> 28:55.183
just because it's causing
Ricky and Amy problems.

28:55.184 --> 28:56.881
That's equally ridiculous.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.771
Then how about if you're not
gonna have a big wedding

28:58.772 --> 29:00.840
because Adrian's parents
and Betty and me...

29:00.841 --> 29:01.616
we don't wanna throw you

29:01.617 --> 29:04.113
a big wedding and a big wedding reception?

29:05.448 --> 29:07.258
We wanna buy you a condo instead.

29:08.944 --> 29:10.431
A... A condo? For what?

29:11.013 --> 29:12.106
For you to live in.

29:12.107 --> 29:14.202
You and Adrian and the baby. What else?

29:14.668 --> 29:16.301
Live on... on our own?

29:16.506 --> 29:17.431
Yeah.

29:17.432 --> 29:19.751
All on your own. You're getting married.

29:19.752 --> 29:22.121
You're starting a family.
You should be on your own.

29:22.648 --> 29:24.288
Of course, this isn't exactly all

29:24.289 --> 29:26.503
on your own since we're
buying you the condo, but...

29:26.504 --> 29:29.281
But we're not ready to live on our own.

29:29.282 --> 29:30.532
We need help.

29:30.533 --> 29:32.273
We need someone to clean up

29:32.274 --> 29:34.463
and to watch after the baby and to cook

29:34.464 --> 29:37.486
and do everything that we have
done for us here, you know?

29:37.487 --> 29:39.811
Or that you and Betty
have done for you here.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.777
Well, you and Adrian are not me and Betty.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.345
What?

29:43.465 --> 29:44.773
You don't wanna live with us,

29:44.774 --> 29:47.279
and I'm sure you don't want to
live with Adrian's parents either.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.559
No. You're wrong. I do wanna live with you.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.916
You're gonna want to spend
time together alone...

29:51.917 --> 29:53.508
you and Adrian and the baby.

29:53.509 --> 29:56.404
We don't need a separate
place for that. Uh...

29:56.581 --> 29:58.772
Yeah. Yeah, you do. Sure you do.

29:59.011 --> 30:02.515
It'll be fun.
It'll be challenging, but it'll be fun.

30:02.980 --> 30:05.685
You're gonna be a dad and a husband.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.409
I can't just be a son anymore?

30:08.637 --> 30:10.198
Of course you'll always be my son,

30:10.199 --> 30:11.641
but, Ben, let's face it.

30:11.721 --> 30:13.241
Now you're my grown-up son.

30:13.801 --> 30:15.942
And we'll be happy to
have you and your wife

30:15.943 --> 30:18.519
and our granddaughter here
anytime you wanna come over.

30:18.749 --> 30:22.260
Okay, Dad. I... I've had a
long and surprising week.

30:22.261 --> 30:25.734
I really can't take being
kicked out of my own home.

30:26.165 --> 30:27.433
I guess you can look at it like that,

30:27.434 --> 30:29.643
or you can look at it as
if you and your family

30:29.644 --> 30:32.028
are gonna be lucky enough
to get a place of your own.

30:32.114 --> 30:34.257
We don't want a place of our own.

30:34.559 --> 30:36.199
But you need a place of your own.

30:36.406 --> 30:38.260
So all you have to do is tell Adrian

30:38.261 --> 30:40.257
that you're gonna get a place to live

30:40.258 --> 30:42.087
instead of a big wedding, that's all.

30:42.838 --> 30:43.619
Can't her parents tell her?

30:43.620 --> 30:45.412
I mean, you're telling me now.

30:45.721 --> 30:47.116
Because we want you to tell her.

30:47.117 --> 30:50.124
And, hey, she might be
really happy about it.

30:51.145 --> 30:52.361
Not likely.

30:54.174 --> 30:56.749
Ben, Ben, Ben.
I know you don't wanna grow up,

30:56.912 --> 30:58.544
but being an adult can be fun.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.800
There's a lot of joy that
comes with being responsible.

31:02.390 --> 31:04.700
No, there isn't.

31:06.178 --> 31:07.683
It's so good to see you.

31:08.255 --> 31:10.741
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's good to see you, too.

31:11.917 --> 31:13.725
What? Nothing.

31:14.852 --> 31:17.628
I'm... I'm sorry about Stanley, but
we really didn't do anything.

31:17.629 --> 31:18.861
I promise.

31:19.406 --> 31:22.059
I'll get over it.
I guess I owe the guy a "Thank you"

31:22.060 --> 31:24.205
'cause you're dad's okay with
me coming over here again.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.352
Well, my dad's okay with your coming over

31:27.353 --> 31:29.992
as long as we're not doing
what we were doing.

31:30.108 --> 31:31.519
It's funny you should mention that.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.001
I don't really wanna do
what we were going anymore.

31:34.077 --> 31:35.856
Really? Me neither.

31:35.857 --> 31:37.799
I mean, it was really getting
to be a lot of work,

31:37.800 --> 31:39.849
and I really wasn't getting
that much out of it.

31:39.875 --> 31:41.978
I mean, it was okay, but, you know,

31:41.979 --> 31:43.946
I got kind of tired of it.

31:44.339 --> 31:46.166
Well, I wasn't tired of it.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.897
It's just that I wouldn't
mind trying something else.

31:48.918 --> 31:50.343
Something else like what?

31:51.294 --> 31:52.737
Don't ask for anything stupid.

31:53.096 --> 31:54.831
Would it be stupid if the two of us

31:54.832 --> 31:56.386
actually had sex?

31:56.721 --> 31:59.169
Well, no, but I want to get
my dad's permission first.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.495
Not really.
I just don't want to do it here.

32:03.757 --> 32:05.239
All right. I'll see what I can do.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.665
Okay. Well, then I will see what I can do.

32:07.666 --> 32:09.423
You know, in terms of birth control,

32:09.424 --> 32:11.426
'cause I want to be on
the pill when we do it.

32:11.454 --> 32:14.805
And I want it to be really
romantic, like in a hotel room.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.526
Like a really nice hotel room.

32:16.611 --> 32:19.364
You know, we could have, like,
candles and flowers and music.

32:20.365 --> 32:22.181
I guess I'm gonna have to
save up for this then.

32:22.182 --> 32:24.613
Yeah. Well, I'm in no
particular rush, so...

32:24.843 --> 32:27.146
Well, I kind of am.
It's been a long summer.

32:30.618 --> 32:31.689
Lauren?

32:31.738 --> 32:32.971
Oh. Yeah.

32:34.089 --> 32:35.671
Can't you just wait till I go home?

32:36.524 --> 32:37.677
Are you kidding?

32:39.285 --> 32:40.308
Okay.

32:43.929 --> 32:46.169
All right. All right.

32:46.778 --> 32:49.586
I'll sleep in the same bed with
you and not have sex with you.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.386
I thought you wanted me to sleep
over so we could have sex.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.681
You wanted to have sex.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.402
You've been wanting to have sex for months.
What happened?

32:56.602 --> 32:57.618
The wedding.

32:58.777 --> 33:01.398
I just... I was looking at Adrian's plans,

33:01.399 --> 33:03.317
and I thought, "That's what I want."

33:03.557 --> 33:04.932
I want a wedding.

33:05.534 --> 33:06.785
I'll tell you what, if we're still together

33:06.786 --> 33:09.447
when I wanna get married,
then we'll have a wedding.

33:09.543 --> 33:11.377
How's that? How's this?

33:12.257 --> 33:13.551
I don't wanna have sex with any guy

33:13.552 --> 33:15.456
unless there's a chance
we're gonna get married.

33:16.701 --> 33:18.100
There's a chance.

33:18.220 --> 33:19.548
How much of a chance?

33:20.692 --> 33:22.260
How much of a chance do you need?

33:23.013 --> 33:24.101
That's not funny.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.546
Yeah, I know, but if I don't keep

33:25.547 --> 33:28.037
a sense of humor about
this, I might go insane.

33:28.201 --> 33:29.202
Do we really need to make

33:29.203 --> 33:31.332
this big of a deal out
of having sex, Grace?

33:31.479 --> 33:32.811
You're on the pill.

33:32.812 --> 33:34.268
I have condoms.

33:34.612 --> 33:36.677
We've talked about it and talked about it

33:37.480 --> 33:38.923
and talked about it.

33:41.136 --> 33:42.624
And I really care about you.

33:44.053 --> 33:47.432
Yeah. I do, too.

33:48.337 --> 33:49.468
Really?

33:50.791 --> 33:51.827
Just not tonight.

33:54.153 --> 33:55.176
Why not?

33:55.912 --> 33:57.336
I'm just really not in the mood.

34:00.612 --> 34:02.772
All right. I get that.

34:03.787 --> 34:04.824
You do?

34:06.245 --> 34:07.333
You're not upset?

34:07.690 --> 34:09.561
No, I'm not upset.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.806
I'm not that upset anyway.

34:12.172 --> 34:13.388
All right.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.356
I guess you can sleep up here with me.

34:36.043 --> 34:37.255
Hello?

34:37.504 --> 34:38.847
Ricky?

34:39.790 --> 34:40.989
Coast is clear.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.321
I'm gonna call Mom.

34:51.976 --> 34:54.072
Guilt is a terrible thing to waste.

34:54.628 --> 34:56.710
I'll see if I can get
John interested in a nap.

34:56.710 --> 34:57.676
Come on, John.

34:58.622 --> 34:59.725
Oh!

34:59.739 --> 35:00.811
Come on.

35:13.148 --> 35:13.964
Mom?

35:13.965 --> 35:15.357
Oh, Amy, I was gonna call you,

35:15.358 --> 35:17.405
but I didn't want you to talk
on your phone in the car.

35:17.841 --> 35:19.233
Are you still in the car?

35:19.472 --> 35:21.177
No. No, I'm not in the car.

35:21.178 --> 35:23.034
I'm home. I'm all the way home.

35:23.309 --> 35:25.660
I just felt terrible about the way I acted.

35:25.860 --> 35:27.472
I miss you. I really do,

35:27.473 --> 35:30.536
but I just don't like being away
from Ricky on the weekends.

35:31.292 --> 35:33.469
Amy, you either trust him or you don't.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.185
I trust him. I do.

35:35.877 --> 35:38.932
I just can't expect him
to just not have sex.

35:39.323 --> 35:41.599
Yeah, you can expect something from him.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.940
It'll be good for him.

35:42.944 --> 35:46.187
Maybe. Or maybe expecting
something from him

35:46.188 --> 35:47.677
would just make him feel pressured.

35:47.784 --> 35:49.305
Amy, tell me the truth.

35:49.389 --> 35:51.133
Have you two still not had sex?

35:51.372 --> 35:52.652
No, we haven't.

35:52.809 --> 35:54.537
Well, I think that that's good, Amy.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.728
I think that you should wait
until you can trust him

35:56.729 --> 35:58.680
not to have sex with someone else.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.719
And maybe that'll happen

35:59.720 --> 36:02.503
when he's older and more mature,
or maybe it'll never happen.

36:02.716 --> 36:03.832
I think the only way that

36:03.833 --> 36:05.876
he's gonna stop having sex with other girls

36:05.877 --> 36:07.542
is if I have sex with him.

36:07.657 --> 36:10.043
No, you don't. You don't think that.

36:10.044 --> 36:12.572
You're just using that as
an excuse to marry him.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.451
And I thought he wasn't having
sex with other girls anyway.

36:15.700 --> 36:19.161
He's not.
But I'm sure he can't wait forever.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.377
Well, he can wait for a while.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.559
And what if you sleep with Ricky,

36:23.560 --> 36:25.759
and he still has sex with other girls?

36:25.760 --> 36:28.508
You know that's possible, right?
It's entirely possible.

36:28.509 --> 36:31.756
It's possible.
But I don't think he would do that if...

36:31.757 --> 36:33.161
If you were married.

36:34.033 --> 36:35.377
Must be genetic.

36:35.967 --> 36:37.888
That's the same thing I
thought about your father.

36:42.896 --> 36:43.840
Hey.

36:44.868 --> 36:47.060
So, did you talk to Ben last night?

36:47.380 --> 36:48.533
I went out with Ben last night.

36:49.037 --> 36:51.196
Yeah, but after that. After he went home.

36:51.323 --> 36:54.380
Did you talk to him after that?
No. I scared him away.

36:54.628 --> 36:56.710
Oh. With all the wedding plans, huh?

36:57.003 --> 36:58.193
No.

36:58.329 --> 37:00.240
No, not the wedding plans.

37:00.241 --> 37:02.012
He's fine with the wedding plans.

37:02.013 --> 37:04.780
It was something else entirely.
You don't wanna know.

37:12.084 --> 37:13.114
Hey, son.

37:13.688 --> 37:14.621
Dad.

37:14.622 --> 37:15.599
Hi.

37:16.584 --> 37:17.479
You okay?

37:17.676 --> 37:19.117
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

37:21.319 --> 37:22.280
Oh.

37:28.265 --> 37:32.297
I was, uh, wondering if we could talk.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.161
Well, if that's all you wanna do...

37:37.764 --> 37:39.327
Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow.

37:39.328 --> 37:41.169
Ow, ow. You are sharp.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.513
You are two people.

37:44.427 --> 37:45.893
Ooh.

37:45.928 --> 37:49.074
Uh, so, what do you wanna talk about?

37:49.151 --> 37:52.472
I wanna talk about not
having such a big wedding.

37:54.140 --> 37:56.012
But it's not such a big wedding.

37:56.311 --> 37:57.736
I want a small wedding.

37:57.791 --> 37:59.966
We can't have a small wedding.

37:59.972 --> 38:02.298
I already told all our friends
they can be in the wedding.

38:02.336 --> 38:05.197
I called Henry and Alice this morning.
They're really excited.

38:05.412 --> 38:07.035
I think it would be better

38:07.036 --> 38:09.540
if instead we asked my dad

38:09.541 --> 38:11.685
to buy us a condo.

38:12.864 --> 38:15.394
A condo for just the three of us?

38:16.156 --> 38:18.381
Our own condo? Our own home?
Are you kidding me?

38:18.382 --> 38:19.332
No. But if we do that, we

38:19.333 --> 38:21.215
really shouldn't ask our
parents for anything else.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.371
So we should just have a small
family gathering at my house,

38:23.372 --> 38:25.528
and then you and I can
move into our own place.

38:25.529 --> 38:28.458
I don't care if we elope. Oh, my God!

38:28.472 --> 38:31.160
No, I can't believe it. Ben Boykewich! Ohh!

38:31.170 --> 38:32.811
Oh, you are the best!

38:32.812 --> 38:35.742
You are the best husband and
father two girls could ever have.

38:35.745 --> 38:38.321
Wait. I could ever have.
You know what I mean.

38:39.303 --> 38:41.001
Our own place? Mm-hmm.

38:41.455 --> 38:42.692
Ooh, we should get something

38:42.693 --> 38:44.443
that goes with the china
that we already picked out.

38:44.444 --> 38:44.947
You know, with the same

38:44.948 --> 38:46.748
tile colors and everything. You know what?

38:46.749 --> 38:49.198
I don't really care about stainless
steel appliances that much.

38:49.199 --> 38:51.294
I like white. White is very clean.

38:51.644 --> 38:54.033
Oh, I would love it

38:54.034 --> 38:55.783
if we could have a black and white kitchen.

38:56.272 --> 38:58.689
Yeah, black and white tiles throughout.

38:58.861 --> 39:01.516
Although I really usually
like a lot of color.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.453
But a higher contrast is easier

39:03.454 --> 39:05.325
for the baby to differentiate.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.654
But you know what?
We can always put in colorful accents

39:07.655 --> 39:09.048
and accessories.

39:12.070 --> 39:13.158
It's me.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.484
Don't say anything. W...

39:23.137 --> 39:24.401
I wanna talk to you.

39:25.184 --> 39:26.703
I wanna talk to you about having sex.

39:26.704 --> 39:28.151
W... Shh. No.

39:28.152 --> 39:29.697
Just let me say this.

39:29.974 --> 39:32.453
I love you, and I know you love me,

39:32.836 --> 39:34.609
and I'm ready to have sex with you.

39:34.681 --> 39:37.549
So I'm going to go into the bedroom,

39:37.550 --> 39:39.856
and I'm going to take this off,

39:39.857 --> 39:42.245
and I'm going to be wearing
some French lingerie

39:42.246 --> 39:43.824
that I bought in New York,

39:44.189 --> 39:46.128
and the two of us are going to get into bed

39:46.129 --> 39:47.920
and do what we've been wanting to do

39:47.921 --> 39:50.057
for a long, long time.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.856
No. Shh.

39:55.817 --> 39:57.336
I'm gonna be waiting for you

39:57.527 --> 39:59.305
right in...

40:01.635 --> 40:02.939
there.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.541
I always thought it was him.

40:05.145 --> 40:06.777
I thought he was the one
who came after you.

40:09.421 --> 40:10.637
I'm sorry, Ricky.

40:17.596 --> 40:19.068
You said, "Don't say anything."

40:19.801 --> 40:23.339
I know. Now I feel like a complete idiot.

40:25.679 --> 40:26.762
But...

40:27.814 --> 40:29.477
we should still have sex.

40:33.237 --> 40:35.636
Fine. We'll have sex in here.

40:36.048 --> 40:38.273
Sit down. Let's talk, Amy.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.825
I wanna have sex with you.

40:45.932 --> 40:48.234
Maybe this isn't the right time.

40:52.749 --> 40:53.837
You're right.

40:57.112 --> 40:58.824
Maybe this isn't the right time.

41:00.484 --> 41:03.153
Maybe the right time...

41:03.672 --> 41:06.692
Whoa, whoa. I don't think it's
the right time for that either.

41:06.693 --> 41:07.780
Oh, no.

41:07.781 --> 41:08.934
Uh...

41:14.884 --> 41:15.924
Ricky,

41:17.740 --> 41:18.982
will you marry me?

41:19.182 --> 41:29.382
