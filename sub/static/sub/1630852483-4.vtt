16:45.370 --> 16:46.300
Yes, ma'am.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.780
Hide inside.

16:58.780 --> 16:59.780
And sit down.

17:35.980 --> 17:41.690
[Drapery Shop]

17:42.860 --> 17:45.190
Why are you stalling?
Hurry up and step outside.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.460
Come now, step outside.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.800
Are you having fun? Are you?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.200
No, you are killing me.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.240
Killing me with your beauty.

18:31.070 --> 18:32.710
Darn it!

18:51.060 --> 18:52.090
Now then.

18:52.730 --> 18:56.460
From now on, act as lovers.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.230
That is utterly absurd.
I choose to be siblings.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.840
Fine. Act as siblings then.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.560
Are you sure you are Kim Jo-yi?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.960
You look like a completely
different person.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.430
I do?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.930
Does it look that bad on me?

20:06.770 --> 20:09.440
Then how about this one?

20:22.550 --> 20:25.220
Goodness, how have you been?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.350
Welcome, Gwang-soon!

20:27.420 --> 20:29.060
I was waiting for you.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.160
-Wait here for a moment.
-I will.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.230
[We decided to meet
at the drapery shop in the market.]

20:34.860 --> 20:36.960
Nothing happened, right?

20:37.300 --> 20:40.230
What could have possibly happened?

20:42.170 --> 20:44.100
Bi-ryeo is not here yet.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.370
What about that child?

20:46.270 --> 20:49.340
An accident happened today,
so she has been locked up in the shed.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.050
I will bring her with me
when I come back later.

20:52.110 --> 20:54.010
Hurry up and go back.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.180
Something will happen
if you are absent for too long.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.150
-I am off then.
-Take care.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.460
-Go follow her.
-Understood.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.000
You dropped this.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.140
I did not notice. Thank you.

21:20.210 --> 21:22.410
[The password is,
"I came from Hill Heunhaeng."]

21:22.480 --> 21:23.940
I came from Hill Heunhaeng.

21:27.510 --> 21:29.680
I heard there is a festival here,

21:29.750 --> 21:31.950
so I came to earn some money.

21:32.450 --> 21:36.120
I am glad that you came.
We were really short of hands.

21:36.190 --> 21:39.190
-I will carry these for you.
-Thank you.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.160
-This is the way.
-This way?

21:41.230 --> 21:43.030
Yes.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.000
We should go to work as well.

Here, I will give you more.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.790
[Peaceful and Holy House]

23:01.040 --> 23:02.610
Did you hire someone skillful?

23:03.040 --> 23:05.680
Yes, we have hired a carpenter
who built the palace.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.850
As for the materials,
I told them to only use the materials

23:07.910 --> 23:10.250
used to build the palace, so do not worry.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.750
What about the shape of the house?

23:12.820 --> 23:16.220
As a matter of fact,
they said it was best if the house

23:16.290 --> 23:19.430
is in the shape of the character day,
month, or nine.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.860
But day and nine seemed empty,

23:22.560 --> 23:24.460
so I asked to make it
in the shape of the month.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.460
[Month]

23:24.830 --> 23:26.370
When I met with the lords,

23:26.770 --> 23:28.740
they told me the shape trend

23:28.970 --> 23:31.370
has changed from month to luck.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.770
[Luck]

23:32.210 --> 23:33.970
Goodness, is that so?

23:34.670 --> 23:38.150
I apologize
for not knowing the current trend.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.410
It is the house
the eldest son of our family will live in.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.080
Of course, my lord.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.990
I like this better.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.520
I do not like complicated things.

23:48.590 --> 23:49.920
I prefer this, Dad.

23:50.190 --> 23:52.460
Great fortune will come
if it is in the shape of luck.

23:53.490 --> 23:57.200
And how many times
must I tell you to talk properly?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.100
How can you call me Dad?

23:59.170 --> 24:00.470
All right, Father.

24:00.530 --> 24:01.870
I shall take my leave.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.840
Carpenter, spare me a minute.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.170
You are the son
of the highest government official.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.110
When will you stop acting like a child?

24:09.180 --> 24:11.550
Dad, do not worry about me.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.480
The one you should
pay attention to is Tae-seo.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.750
Why would you be worried about Tae-seo?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.490
The King received a report from
the deceased secret royal inspector.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.350
What?

24:22.190 --> 24:25.430
Tae-seo never does a clean job, does he?

24:26.230 --> 24:27.960
Loose ends were not tied

24:28.030 --> 24:30.530
and now people will know
that you stole the offerings.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.830
Watch what you say!

24:32.800 --> 24:34.370
Why must you tread lightly though

24:34.430 --> 24:36.000
-when you are a kingmaker?
-Hush!

24:36.800 --> 24:39.010
You, my father,
are the leader of the nobles,

24:39.070 --> 24:41.410
a contributor of the uproar,
and the King's loyal servant.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.240
So why would you
be worried about anything?

24:45.910 --> 24:49.050
I have yet to retrieve the ledger.

24:49.820 --> 24:52.650
It seems that His Majesty
has turned to the director for his aid

24:52.820 --> 24:55.460
and him having the ledger
will become a nuisance to us.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.560
There is no harm in being cautious.

25:00.390 --> 25:04.200
No way. You have not been
this serious in a while.

25:07.700 --> 25:11.340
Tae-seo holds a grudge against our family
for being born a bastard.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.610
It is why he has been
using my name as leverage

25:14.740 --> 25:18.380
to curry favors with local magistrates
just to increase his wealth.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.720
Which means
that even if the ledger is found,

25:23.780 --> 25:25.120
it would be evidence

25:26.690 --> 25:29.090
of Tae-seo's crimes and not ours.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.260
What are you saying, Father?

25:38.730 --> 25:39.800
Hey!

25:51.140 --> 25:54.310
My apologies, my lord.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.880
I committed a mortal sin.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.420
Let that be what fuels you to work.

26:03.620 --> 26:05.530
You would gladly die while working.

26:06.460 --> 26:09.500
That desire will one day save Joseon.

26:13.130 --> 26:14.800
Do you expect to forever live

26:15.740 --> 26:18.970
as slash-and-burn farmers,
servants, and slaves?

26:20.310 --> 26:21.710
Rather than by rank,

26:22.380 --> 26:25.080
let there be a world where you
are rewarded for the work you do.

26:26.050 --> 26:27.350
That kind of world...

26:29.820 --> 26:31.690
is what we should build together.

26:32.450 --> 26:33.750
My lord!

26:34.490 --> 26:37.720
But until then,
you must endure the sacrifices.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.530
Of course.

26:39.890 --> 26:40.830
Do you understand me?

26:40.890 --> 26:43.160
Yes, of course.

26:48.130 --> 26:49.340
What do you mean?

26:49.840 --> 26:51.340
Tae-seo looks up to you.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.840
Father, I await your order.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.210
Father, is this enough?

26:56.280 --> 26:58.850
Father, can I get you anything?

27:10.420 --> 27:11.560
Gosh.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.360
You are a scary man.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.830
We both know how hard Tae-seo works.

27:17.460 --> 27:20.170
I feel bad for him now.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.340
Even among brothers,
there is a certain rank.

27:26.940 --> 27:28.340
That being said,

27:29.810 --> 27:33.380
you must learn to stay strong, Do-soo.

27:37.050 --> 27:39.690
Yes, Father. Do not fret.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.400
My lord,

27:49.730 --> 27:51.830
do you have pheasant meat
I can offer to the King?

27:52.130 --> 27:53.830
Pheasant meat? Of course.

27:54.230 --> 27:57.970
Freshly caught pheasant meat just came in.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.370
How much would it be?

28:01.010 --> 28:03.910
Well, 200 pils of cotton for one pheasant.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.950
Did you say 200 pils of cotton?

28:07.250 --> 28:09.080
That is how much a horse costs!

28:09.780 --> 28:13.050
How can a pheasant
cost the same as a horse?

28:13.120 --> 28:15.990
Then be whacked for
not offering anything to the King.

28:16.220 --> 28:19.530
Another option would be
to sell your children for a price.

28:19.730 --> 28:21.760
Goodness, my lord!

28:21.900 --> 28:23.700
Please lower the price a little.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.930
My son has been ill for over a month

28:26.000 --> 28:27.730
and I do not have enough
to buy him medicine.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.740
Then get out of my way!

28:29.800 --> 28:31.740
My lord, please.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.340
Are you all right?

28:34.410 --> 28:36.180
I cannot believe he threw himself at you.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.440
How pathetic.

28:38.310 --> 28:39.680
I hope this is enough.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.050
The pheasant meat
I had others pay me with.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.380
This is how it made its way to the palace.

28:45.250 --> 28:46.520
How can one call this a nation

28:46.620 --> 28:48.320
when corruption lurks everywhere?

28:48.620 --> 28:51.120
Maybe leaving Joseon
would be the better idea.

29:12.210 --> 29:16.580
You must be lingering around here
hoping to grab a drink.

29:17.150 --> 29:20.790
You see, this is hayang wine
which is only served to the King.

29:20.950 --> 29:23.820
So tell me. Would you like a glass?

29:23.890 --> 29:25.060
How about a taste?

29:26.530 --> 29:30.130
That is quite all right.
We drink it often ourselves.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.730
As if we would not know of
such a rare wine.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.140
It seems like you are a man
of great status too.

29:40.210 --> 29:42.640
Why else would you be drinking wine
that is only offered to the King?

29:42.740 --> 29:46.950
It is a serious crime
in the eyes of the law.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.250
Why be born a man

29:52.320 --> 29:54.920
only to yield like a fool to such laws?

29:55.120 --> 29:59.360
I wish to drink and eat whatever I want
and die with a smile on my face.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.000
Do you not agree, Chil-guk?

30:04.730 --> 30:05.930
Of course.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.270
Who cares about the law?

30:09.970 --> 30:10.900
I, Chil-guk,

30:10.970 --> 30:13.370
would rather stop taking dumps
than quit drinking.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.380
Pal-soon, what about you?

30:20.910 --> 30:22.450
Of course, brother.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.180
Breaking the law

30:24.680 --> 30:27.520
makes a thrilling pastime.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.580
My sister is the shyest of people.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.680
What a fair maiden.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.960
You must know you are a cutie.

31:09.330 --> 31:10.430
Come on.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.830
-Goodness, my lord.
-Come on.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.410
Did he say that Goo-pal is pretty?

31:21.570 --> 31:22.880
-Shall we?
-Yes, my lord.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.410
Come on in.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.650
Goodness, that was a blast.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.690
Come, my friend.

31:37.660 --> 31:38.930
This is preposterous.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.490
One would think that this is for the King.

31:41.560 --> 31:45.370
What they used to cook the meals
should have been sent as offerings.

31:44.660 --> 31:47.000
[Gongsangmul: Offerings sent
to offices, the palace, or the King]

Food is not what I only see.
There is hemp cloth as well.

You two!

31:57.440 --> 31:58.850
Would you join me in the garden?

31:59.350 --> 32:02.420
Why not? We have good weather for it.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.100
-Mal-jong, are you back?
-I sure am.

Keep dancing if you want.

This way, my sweet.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.810
Have a seat.

32:32.510 --> 32:36.350
Sweetie, you can sit beside me.

32:37.550 --> 32:38.820
Goodness.

32:42.590 --> 32:43.990
Bring us our meal!

32:45.020 --> 32:47.890
Forgive me for asking when we just met,

32:48.760 --> 32:51.330
but could I ask who your father is?

32:53.170 --> 32:56.340
How can one be treated to a meal
without knowing who I must thank?

32:58.540 --> 32:59.670
I have no father.

33:03.310 --> 33:04.810
I am a fatherless child.

33:14.150 --> 33:15.320
Sweetheart,

33:16.260 --> 33:17.390
have a glass.

33:38.340 --> 33:39.410
This...

33:40.750 --> 33:42.320
is not hayang wine.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.250
What?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.250
What do you mean?

33:48.390 --> 33:51.390
What I smell is not lotus flower
but wild chrysanthemum.

33:55.530 --> 33:58.930
I taste hints of ginger
and spicy red chilies.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.600
This is Hansan sogok wine, right?

34:15.420 --> 34:17.550
I was right about you being a partygoer.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.790
You see,
if you were a secret royal inspector

34:20.850 --> 34:22.719
who came here to mess things up,

34:22.790 --> 34:25.560
I was going to kill you and bury you deep.

34:26.090 --> 34:28.760
But you even know
what Hansan sogok wine is!

34:29.260 --> 34:32.900
So you are a real scoundrel. Very well.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.670
[-He tested me on purpose?]
-Bring more wine!

34:40.710 --> 34:44.280
I noticed on my way in
that you have all sorts of things.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.820
Do you happen
to trade medicinal herbs too?

34:50.679 --> 34:52.790
No, we do not deal with medicinal herbs.

34:53.190 --> 34:56.520
The officer in charge is
way too strict and thorough.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.660
It is a nuisance to deal with him.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.530
Is that so?

35:01.830 --> 35:04.900
[I clearly heard it happened
while drying aconite.]

35:05.360 --> 35:07.300

35:07.570 --> 35:09.500
By the way,
where did you get all this liquor from?

Do you make them yourself?

35:12.340 --> 35:14.770
What? Yes, sure.

Pretty lady, where are you from?

35:20.110 --> 35:21.510
Help me out.

35:28.620 --> 35:32.330
Does it matter where I am from?

35:32.530 --> 35:35.030
What matters is that
our paths crossed here, today.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.970
You seem like the romantic type.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.240
-By the way...
-Yes?

35:45.370 --> 35:47.240
All this wine.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.740
Where do you make it?

35:52.910 --> 35:55.410
Oh, we make it in Jinsan.

35:55.550 --> 35:59.250
There is a valley called Baekgwiryeong.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.220
That is where all the wine is made.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.930
What else do you make other than wine?

36:07.260 --> 36:09.700
We make wine,

36:09.760 --> 36:12.170
weave hemp fabric, and make silver.

36:12.230 --> 36:14.370
[Silver? Did he say silver?]

36:22.680 --> 36:25.180
Thanks to you, I got it done so quickly.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.210
And thank you for helping me carry them.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.950
No problem. Tell me if you need my help
with anything else.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.080
Just pack me a few more beef pancakes
when I leave.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.220
Sure.

36:37.260 --> 36:38.720
Where is the child?

36:39.530 --> 36:40.790
In the storage shed.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.330
Go to the backyard of the annex,
and you will see a side door.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.400
I will meet you there with the child,
and you can take her with you.

36:50.140 --> 36:53.740
The cook was looking for a female servant
to help make the side dishes.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.870
[Banbitachi:
Female servant who makes side dishes]

36:53.810 --> 36:55.370
There is a banquet today.

36:55.470 --> 36:58.410
Is that so? I am a great cook.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.480
I see, great. Come with me, then.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.010
-Okay.
-This way, please.

38:14.990 --> 38:16.420
How much longer must we put on this act?

38:18.520 --> 38:19.730
If I am right,

38:20.330 --> 38:22.230
the boy must have arrived
at the station by now.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.430
You should search the house
while I keep them occupied.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.890
-Got it.
-We must find their ledger.

38:55.260 --> 38:57.600
And see if they keep medicinal herbs
somewhere.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.040
Can you please look only at me?

39:10.710 --> 39:13.780
Okay. I shall look only at you.

39:14.210 --> 39:15.310
Well...

39:16.480 --> 39:19.920
I believe you said earlier
that you also make silver.

39:20.750 --> 39:23.360
Silver is not something
you can just whip up.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.220
What do you mean you make silver?

39:25.790 --> 39:29.600
Why do you keep asking questions?
This is suspicious.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.940
I do not understand your taste in women.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.420
The guest of honor should not be so late!

39:53.520 --> 39:56.590
I am hosting this banquet for you.
What took you so long?

39:59.290 --> 40:00.730
Baekgwiryeong was covered in fog.

40:02.060 --> 40:04.600
Right, the trail there is quite rough.

40:05.930 --> 40:09.170
Are you sure it was fog, not smoke?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.640
From the fires?

40:11.300 --> 40:14.040
We have a long way to go to get there.
We are just getting started.

40:14.170 --> 40:17.380
Well, as long as your father
does not throw a fit.

40:17.510 --> 40:20.010
I thought that old man was holding you up.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.480
Who is this?

40:23.980 --> 40:25.120
Me?

40:30.790 --> 40:33.790
Just a scoundrel who happened
to be passing by. He is one of us.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.590
One of us?

40:37.160 --> 40:39.000
Who is your father?

40:42.500 --> 40:44.640
My old man is--

40:44.700 --> 40:45.700
Your old man?

40:46.710 --> 40:48.440
He is not "one of us,"
judging from the way

40:48.670 --> 40:50.140
he is addressing his father.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.540
What? Is she your cup of tea?

41:17.840 --> 41:19.510
She is a new face from Yujeopso.

[Yujeopso: State orphanage

41:20.940 --> 41:23.740
Do not do anything that could get us
in trouble. Things are not looking good.

41:26.310 --> 41:28.450
There will be no problem.

41:28.650 --> 41:31.650
I already spoke with an official
that handles all the orphans

In any case, lie low for the time being.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.290
Until we catch the secret royal inspector.

41:40.230 --> 41:42.930
What? We already took care of him.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.860
Did they send another one?

41:46.230 --> 41:49.870
Good grief.
Must we send out our boys again?

41:50.570 --> 41:52.040
I already did.

41:52.340 --> 41:54.340
But they must be looking for him
in the wrong area.

41:54.740 --> 41:56.810
Once he sets foot in this tiny village,

41:56.880 --> 41:58.810
he will be like a mouse in a jar.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.050
He is welcome to come by.

42:01.410 --> 42:02.820
Do not kill him. Keep him alive.

Why? What do you need him for?

42:05.220 --> 42:07.250
I need to find out how much he knows.

42:08.390 --> 42:09.660
We can kill him after that.

Sure, sounds good.

Excuse me. I must go relieve myself.

Hey, you.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.110
You had better return in 15 minutes.

If you take too long
when you went to relieve yourself,

42:29.240 --> 42:31.910
I would wonder if you went
to report us to the local office.

Come on.
There is no point in reporting us.

are in the palm of my hand.

Tell me who you are!

55:19.980 --> 55:22.050
Grant me a kiss with her

55:23.320 --> 55:25.020
or slit her throat.

55:26.420 --> 55:29.790
Do one or the other,
and I will let the others live.

55:34.130 --> 55:36.160
-Come on!
-Off we go!

55:40.000 --> 55:41.270
We will solve this man to man.

55:43.130 --> 55:46.040
What do you say?
Would that not be more imposing?

55:53.750 --> 55:55.050
Give us room.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.900
Draw your sword.

56:12.530 --> 56:13.700
I would rather not.

56:16.170 --> 56:18.040
You know that learning how to fight

56:18.100 --> 56:20.210
will lead me to hurt someone--

56:20.510 --> 56:22.970
I would rather reserve blades for cooking.

56:45.430 --> 56:46.560
This will be my weapon of choice.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.300
This is no time for bravado.
Pick up the sword instead!

56:50.370 --> 56:52.040
Grab the sword!

56:52.270 --> 56:53.270
My lord...

56:54.040 --> 56:55.740
My lord, the sword...

57:37.680 --> 57:38.920
[The scenes with animals
were safely filmed.]

57:38.980 --> 57:40.790
[Underage actors were managed with care.]

57:51.500 --> 57:52.660
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk
for his special appearance.]

57:53.600 --> 57:56.100
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

57:56.470 --> 57:59.700
[There will come a time where you must
protect yourself and those you love.]

58:00.170 --> 58:02.110
[The mastermind might be]

58:02.170 --> 58:03.880
[closer by than I realized.]

58:04.140 --> 58:05.480
[He must be stopped.]

58:05.540 --> 58:07.910
[-If he cannot be stopped--]
-Then he must be killed?

58:08.480 --> 58:11.280
[One cannot catch a big fish
without tempting bait.]

58:11.720 --> 58:14.050
His Majesty is--

58:14.290 --> 58:15.950
I told you never to say it.

58:16.190 --> 58:17.490
[Would you like to join my journey
to Ganghwa Island?]

58:17.560 --> 58:19.190
[Yes, I would love to go with you.]

58:19.390 --> 58:20.430
[I am sad to see you go.]

58:20.490 --> 58:22.160
[The girl is the inspector's weak point.]

58:22.230 --> 58:23.860
[Bring her to me no matter what!]
