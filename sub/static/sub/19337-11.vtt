well in hand.

<i> Oh, I played her masterfully.</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:09.174
<i> She wants to be a courtesan.</i>
<i> In return,</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:12.077
<i> she is guiding Charles for us.</i>

00:12.079 --> 00:13.345
I am meant to help you,

00:13.347 --> 00:14.580
Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.148
It is my purpose.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.017
Rizzio, I am blessed

00:18.019 --> 00:20.085
to have the loyalty
you have placed in me.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.054
You must say that
I acted on my own.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.022
You must ban me
from Scotland.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.423
Summon Lord Bothwell.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.392
I know he would rather die
than see you harmed.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.094
I've kept you safe, and aware
of Darnley's true nature

00:29.096 --> 00:31.196
at every turn.
You're my Loyal Watchman.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.164
Yes.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.399
Leeza said Charles is unwell

00:33.401 --> 00:34.666
and I was needed immediately.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.101
Your brother is
quite recovered, Henri.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.337
So he's not going
to be abdicating?

00:38.339 --> 00:39.405
No.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.040
I am pregnant with your child.

00:41.042 --> 00:44.043
I will be a good father
and a good husband.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.278
On that you have my oath.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.548

00:49.550 --> 00:51.116

00:51.118 --> 00:53.385
She certainly
adores her mother.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.421
You'll know the feeling
soon enough.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.289
Oh, I hope so.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.125
Thank you for returning
to court, Greer.

01:00.127 --> 01:03.095
I'd lose my mind keeping
this secret alone.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.596
Only Darnley knows
you're pregnant?

01:04.598 --> 01:07.199
I told James before he left.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.368
I was hard on you
about James.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.437
Yes, but you were right.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.472
In trying to protect
my throne, I...

01:13.474 --> 01:15.774
put my brother in
a dangerous position

01:15.776 --> 01:17.843
that ended with
his banishment.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.813
And now I fear there is a
cost for<i> everyone</i> I love.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.848
Well, Darnley
should be safe, then.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.150
(Mary laughs) For your
information, Darnley's been

01:25.152 --> 01:26.618
on very good
behavior recently.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.120
It sounds like you're
warming up to him.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.455
I'm not sure I can,

01:29.457 --> 01:31.690
but he is the father
of my child, and...

01:31.692 --> 01:33.192
he's trying.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.177
So I can try as well.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.161
Could something else be in
the way, perhaps? Something...

01:37.164 --> 01:40.199
tall, handsome
and Scottish?

01:40.201 --> 01:42.167
If you are talking
about Lord Bothwell...

01:42.169 --> 01:43.402
DARNLEY:
Mary.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.238
I've been
looking for you.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.241
I have news from England.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.211
I'll leave you two alone.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.249
It's not public knowledge yet,

01:57.251 --> 01:59.184
but my friends at home
in England are saying

01:59.186 --> 02:00.853
that our marriage
has pressured Queen Elizabeth

02:00.855 --> 02:04.289
to take a husband: the Archduke
Ferdinand of Austria.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.457
A Catholic?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.892
Yes.
Elizabeth has had

02:06.894 --> 02:08.127
countless suitors,
and she's never married.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.461
She won't go through with it.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.729
You married me.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.131
Didn't you?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.398
To ensure your survival
against your cousin?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.900
Well, now she is doing the same.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.169
If Elizabeth marries
the archduke,

02:17.171 --> 02:19.571
we will lose
our Catholic advantage.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.674
The Vatican may shift
its support to England.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.176
Because they will already have

02:24.178 --> 02:25.344
a Catholic king
on the English throne.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.378
Yes.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.316
I know that we now have
a child to consider,

02:31.318 --> 02:33.185
but if we wish to take
England, our forces

02:33.187 --> 02:35.921
must strike before Elizabeth
announces her engagement.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.589
It is now or never.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.326
I always knew
this day would come,

02:41.328 --> 02:44.830
that as queen, I would have
to order the attack, but yet...

02:44.832 --> 02:47.166
It is still
a terrifying decision.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.168
But you won't have
to face Elizabeth alone.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.637
Just say the word,
and I will call forth

02:51.639 --> 02:54.306

09:51.091 --> 09:54.225
As do I.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.227
(door opens)

09:58.765 --> 10:02.100
I only have a few moments,
but I needed to see you.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.645
How is the archduke
treating you?

10:13.647 --> 10:15.313
Fine.
He's perfectly nice.

10:15.315 --> 10:18.016
But when he talks, and

10:18.018 --> 10:21.252
he talks quite a bit...

10:21.254 --> 10:23.355
all I can think of is you.

10:26.727 --> 10:31.196
I hate to admit this, but...

10:31.198 --> 10:33.832
i-it's more difficult
than I imagined,

10:33.834 --> 10:35.233
your marrying another.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.969
Is it too difficult for you?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.071
Can you live like this?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.206
I just want what's best

10:41.208 --> 10:42.741
for your reign.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.376
If our situation
becomes too complicated,

10:44.378 --> 10:45.877
too painful

10:45.879 --> 10:47.212
for either of us,

10:47.214 --> 10:48.279
I'll simply disappear.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.016
No. Don't say that.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.218

RIZZIO:
Lord Bothwell.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.894
What are you doing here?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.663
The queen sent for me
to return to court.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.398
Even if she did,
it's not the time

11:06.400 --> 11:09.167
for you to be distracting Mary
with your presence.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.403
Bothwell?

11:11.405 --> 11:13.371
I am so sorry, Mary.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.973
DARNLEY :
So that's Bothwell.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.241
The man who despises me,

11:16.243 --> 11:17.409
and you invited him here.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.244
After James left I was upset.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.945
I needed someone I could trust.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.280
I promised you that I would be
by your side

11:22.282 --> 11:25.250
as a true husband,
and you do this.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.851
I'm sorry, Darnley.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.753
Calm down;
I'll take care of this.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.692
I got your message.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.026
Are you all right?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.263
I'm... I'm fine.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.264
Forgive me,

11:39.266 --> 11:40.699
I should never
have sent for you.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.300
I disagree.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.037
I'm trying to improve my...
situation

11:46.039 --> 11:47.872
here at court.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.441
And though I appreciate
your coming,

11:49.443 --> 11:51.309
I must ask you to leave.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.146
You heard the queen,
didn't you?

11:55.148 --> 11:56.715
She asked you to leave.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.717
Though I'm glad that we
finally get to meet,

11:58.719 --> 12:00.051
since I've heard such a lot

12:00.053 --> 12:02.721
about the, uh,
what do you call it?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.355
Ah. The Loyal Watchman.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.424
You wrote Mary some very nasty
letters about me,

12:06.426 --> 12:08.059
and yet here I am,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.728
ruler of Scotland.

12:09.730 --> 12:13.431
So aren't you going to bow
to your new king?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.233
No.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.268
You may wear the
Scottish crown, Darnley,

12:17.270 --> 12:19.270
but you'll always
be English by birth.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.407
And I must confess, I
don't like English people.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.209
Bothwell.
They've crossed our borders

12:24.211 --> 12:26.411

countrymen for 300 years.

If I could bathe these
hills in English blood,

12:28.415 --> 12:31.950
I would. So no, I will
never bow to you.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.419
I would rather die.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.787
Clearly.

Stop. Guards, stand down.

bloodshed in my court.

Very well.

you may walk

17:25.412 --> 17:26.477
Of course I would!

17:26.479 --> 17:28.746
You know I would.

It is my blood, my allies
that give you England.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.163

of Scotland

17:47.500 --> 17:49.367

I am without power,

17:59.846 --> 18:01.345
I am also without risk.

your wife and queen

18:31.277 --> 18:33.144

18:33.146 --> 18:35.880
That child exists
solely to replace me.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.850

everything that you wanted.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.153
Now it's my turn.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.388
Do not deny me this,

to victory

20:08.274 --> 20:09.874
waiting in the harbor,
should I need them.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.876
You might be my
elder brother,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.312
but I am stronger than you
in every way.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.346
More's the pity,

20:15.347 --> 20:16.379
which is what they all feel
for you.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.382
Especially her.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.218
(yelling)

20:21.387 --> 20:22.653
Charles, would you please?!

20:29.462 --> 20:33.431
(both laughing)

20:33.433 --> 20:34.899
All right, well,

20:34.901 --> 20:36.767
if you haven't forgotten it,
then what is it?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.705
(Bothwell clears throat)

20:40.707 --> 20:42.740
Would you just, um,
give me a moment.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.279
I don't know why
you're following me, Rizzio.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.447
Queen Mary needs
to speak with you.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.715
It's serious.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.949
She told me to stay away.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.318
Desperate times.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.022
MARY:
<i> I need to abort</i>

20:58.024 --> 20:59.690
the mission in England,

20:59.692 --> 21:01.025
but I can't abandon my men;

21:01.027 --> 21:02.927
I need to return
them home,

21:02.929 --> 21:04.895
along with the evidence
Darnley is holding against me:

21:04.897 --> 21:06.797
my royal seal.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.966
I need you to retrieve it all.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.669
(soft chuckle)
It would be an
unsanctioned mission.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.337
If you were captured
on English soil...

21:13.339 --> 21:15.039
I know what happens to me.

21:17.410 --> 21:21.579
I realize what
I am asking of you.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.949
But I have nowhere to turn
and no one else I can trust.

21:24.951 --> 21:29.020
You don't need anyone else.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.989
(sniffles)

21:31.991 --> 21:35.326
You must find Darnley's ally,
Lord Barrett.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.495
Do you know where?
No.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.063
Darnley lied to me
about their location.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.333
But I do know someone who
could help, Gideon Blackburn.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.702
You want me to ask
a former flame

21:44.704 --> 21:46.604
and advisor to Queen Elizabeth

21:46.606 --> 21:49.874
for information about
men plotting against her?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.776
It's because he cares
for me and my cousin

21:51.778 --> 21:53.377
that he is likely to help.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.982
I know we hardly
know each other,

21:57.984 --> 22:02.820
and yet here I am, asking you
to risk everything for me.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.690
With or without your crown,

22:05.692 --> 22:07.458
I would do anything for you.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.396
Bothwell.

22:12.398 --> 22:13.998
Be safe.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.404
(door opens, then closes)

22:20.406 --> 22:22.973
CLAUDE:
<i> I was so excited</i>

22:22.975 --> 22:25.343
for my family
to be together again.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.046
But we're a disaster.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.082
Charles is damaged,

22:31.084 --> 22:33.551
Henri's ruthless,

22:33.553 --> 22:34.952
and my mother is

22:34.954 --> 22:36.654
Catherine de Medici.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.722
Now that you've seen

22:37.724 --> 22:39.924
me and my family up close,

22:39.926 --> 22:41.992
you must be disappointed.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.894
Still think I offer you

22:43.896 --> 22:45.963
a promising future?

22:51.604 --> 22:53.537
I don't regret a thing.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.707
And you are no disappointment.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.648
Perhaps, when we

23:04.650 --> 23:07.051
start a family of our own,

23:07.053 --> 23:08.552
it can be different.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.991
Luc.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.161
You're a good man,
but you should know that...

23:19.732 --> 23:21.832
...I'm not in love with you.

23:21.834 --> 23:25.169
I'm not in love
with you, either.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.704
Yet.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.005
Good.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.107
(both chuckle softly)

23:33.079 --> 23:35.079
NARCISSE:
<i> Foolish Henri.</i>

23:35.081 --> 23:37.014
You had a chance to
make amends tonight,

23:37.016 --> 23:38.749
but you squandered it.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.551
Now I see no other option

23:40.553 --> 23:44.054
but to inform Spain
that their prize pony

23:44.056 --> 23:45.556
dabbles in the occult.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.893
Or you could do nothing.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.629
Tell me, Lord Chancellor,

23:51.631 --> 23:55.032
is the king aware that you and
his beloved Nicole are lovers?

23:55.034 --> 23:57.201
Yes, I've noticed
Nicole disappear

23:57.203 --> 23:59.537
shortly after
you leave a room.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.740
How do you think my brother
would react if he knew?

24:02.742 --> 24:06.110
Do you think blackmail
will protect you?

24:06.112 --> 24:08.012
How endearing.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.980
But let me offer some advice:

24:09.982 --> 24:11.715
next time you threaten someone,

24:11.717 --> 24:13.150
make sure you have proof.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.652
A theory

24:14.654 --> 24:17.822
is nothing more than a feather.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.056
Tickles.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.560
Don't worry, you're young.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.228
You will get better at this.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.165
That is outrageous!

24:28.167 --> 24:29.700
Henri attacks his brother,
the king,

24:29.702 --> 24:31.535
defies his own mother,

24:31.537 --> 24:33.737
and then he has
the nerve to threaten you?

24:33.739 --> 24:35.072
Well, enough is enough.
Yeah.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.140
We will draft

24:36.142 --> 24:37.575
a letter to the Vatican.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.176
I don't care if he is my child.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.046
He wants to act like
a young buck,

24:42.048 --> 24:43.981
I will make him a doe.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.650
Catherine. Sit down.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.886
We are not going
to do anything to Henri.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.889
That boy has earned my respect.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.158
Narcisse...
We have been backing
the wrong horse.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.192
For months trying to

24:55.194 --> 24:58.062
make Charles act like a king.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.097
Well, Henri is a king.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.166
Look at him. In the
few weeks he has been here

25:02.168 --> 25:04.034
he has already
shown more confidence,

25:04.036 --> 25:07.738
cunning and boldness
than Charles ever has,

25:07.740 --> 25:09.206
and ever will.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.643
By taking out his brother
with a ball full with rocks?

25:13.779 --> 25:15.212
It's cruel,

25:15.214 --> 25:17.214
but inventive.

25:17.216 --> 25:20.017
Spanish warships
are backing him.
If that isn't kingly,

25:20.019 --> 25:21.685
I don't know what is.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.087
Face it, Catherine,

25:23.089 --> 25:25.055
Henri is the future.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.258
What exactly are you suggesting?

25:27.260 --> 25:29.093
Removing Charles by force?

25:29.095 --> 25:31.061
Even if there's a peaceful way
of transferring power,

25:31.063 --> 25:32.663
which there isn't,

25:32.665 --> 25:34.098
Charles would not survive.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.000
He will always be seen
as a threat

25:36.002 --> 25:37.234
to Henri's reign.

25:37.236 --> 25:40.070
He will be murdered
one way or another.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.640
And the entire Valois line
will be vulnerable.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.874
Maybe not.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.176
If there was
a strong king like Henri

25:46.178 --> 25:47.745
to replace him.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.649
I like Charles, but...

25:51.651 --> 25:55.052
he is irreversibly damaged
from whatever he endured

25:55.054 --> 25:57.154
at the hands of the Red Knights.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.156
But it's too late.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.191
For everyone.
So you're with Henri, then?

26:01.193 --> 26:03.861
Against Charles?

26:03.863 --> 26:05.229
Against me?

26:05.231 --> 26:06.564
I am on no one's side

26:06.566 --> 26:08.799
but my own.

26:08.801 --> 26:12.202
But I am done with
fighting a losing battle.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.204
Spain wants Henri
on the throne,

26:14.206 --> 26:16.974
and you do not have the power

26:16.976 --> 26:18.242
to save Charles.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.977
Not anymore.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.255
(grunts)

26:34.260 --> 26:36.160
♪ ♪

26:58.250 --> 27:03.187
(music playing,
indistinct conversations)

27:03.189 --> 27:05.122
I am going to scream.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.191
He invited me on
a four-hour carriage ride

27:07.193 --> 27:09.393
through the country.
Tonight.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.128
Very romantic.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.365
He's a nice enough person,
but four hours?

27:14.367 --> 27:16.066
Gideon, you have to
get me out of it.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.901
I'm merely asking
for tonight.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.272
Fine. (clears throat)
I'll make something up

27:22.274 --> 27:25.142
just before you leave,
some... important business

27:25.144 --> 27:26.844
that will allow you to cancel.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.212
ELIZABETH:
Well, it better work.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.080
I expect this important business

27:30.082 --> 27:31.148
to keep us occupied

27:31.150 --> 27:32.282
the entire night.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.084
PAGE:
Lord Blackburn,

27:34.086 --> 27:36.153
you have an Italian visitor
here to speak with you.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.689
Oh, you see?

27:38.691 --> 27:40.090
Works every time.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.164
Lord Blackburn.
My name is David Rizzio.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.167
My associate and I apologize
for arriving unannounced.
Yes.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.336
I'm not sure why you asked
to speak with me, personally.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.672
We have an Italian consulate

27:54.674 --> 27:56.273
which might be
better suited to...

27:56.275 --> 27:58.175
Actually, t-this is
a Scottish matter, actually,

27:58.177 --> 28:01.045
one requiring your discretion.

28:01.047 --> 28:02.413
My discretion?

28:02.415 --> 28:04.114
Queen Mary is in danger.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.350
And we wish to resolve
the threat against her

28:06.352 --> 28:09.186
without divulging
her weaknesses to Elizabeth.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.723
I'm sorry, but I don't know you.

28:12.725 --> 28:15.059
And I work for Queen Elizabeth,
not Mary.

28:15.061 --> 28:19.163
You nearly married the queen
of Scots to protect her.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.932
She said we could trust you
to protect her life.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.867
Was she mistaken?

28:23.869 --> 28:27.171
I didn't get
your associate's name.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.174
RIZZIO:
Apologies for
Lord Bothwell's tongue.

28:30.176 --> 28:34.378
I think what he means is
that Mary's situation is dire.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.080
There is a noble
here on English soil

28:36.082 --> 28:38.415
who would do her harm.
Lord Barrett.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.919
Yes, I know him,
he's Darnley's man.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.088
And a Catholic.
Yes.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.356
It is critical
that we find Barrett

28:46.358 --> 28:48.292
before he carries out
the deadly threat,

28:48.294 --> 28:51.395
because if something terrible
should happen to Mary,

28:51.397 --> 28:53.430
we will all be responsible.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.300
Gideon, will you help us?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.442
MARY:
<i> I hate waiting.</i>

29:05.444 --> 29:09.146
Not knowing if the men
I sent are alive or dead.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.215
I hate it almost as
much as I hate myself

29:11.217 --> 29:14.451
for trusting Darnley again.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.054
(door opens)

29:19.191 --> 29:21.358
I need to speak to the queen.
Alone.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.194
Greer has heard
all about your threats.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.196
You can speak freely.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.231
Fine.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.866
You need to make a decision.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.367
If you still want England,

29:30.369 --> 29:33.237
then grant me
the Crown Matrimonial.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.272
Darnley, she needs rest
in her condition...

29:35.274 --> 29:37.775
This is between me and my wife.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.010
And you are just
stalling for time.

29:41.847 --> 29:44.548
Now, the privy council

29:44.550 --> 29:46.283
are already
assembled downstairs.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.285
Sign the Crown Matrimonial,

29:48.287 --> 29:51.321
and we can make
the announcement together.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.260
I know how difficult
this is for you.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.494
I promise, you won't regret it.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.430
This is the right
thing to do, Mary.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.965
For us.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.233
For our child.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.269
I will be a true king,

30:05.271 --> 30:07.304
and we will finally be equals.

30:14.046 --> 30:18.081
I made you king.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.451
But we will never be equals.

30:27.293 --> 30:30.160
You just lost England.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.461
I will warn
Elizabeth against you,

30:31.463 --> 30:33.263
and when
she gets word of your plot,

30:33.265 --> 30:34.898
she will come for you.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.234
And she will take your head.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.602
Oh, do what you must, Darnley,

30:38.604 --> 30:41.138
but I will never sign.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.245
BARRETT:
We do not make our move
on Elizabeth until King Darnley

30:48.247 --> 30:50.347
gives the order.
Now, I am in command

30:50.349 --> 30:52.583
of this operation,

30:52.585 --> 30:56.186
and we will continue to wait
here for further instructions.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.323
RIZZIO:
Lord Barrett, the wait is over.

30:59.325 --> 31:02.259
Queen Mary says you're all to
return to Scottish soil at once.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.461
The mission has been aborted.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.930
Stay where you are.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.366
You're Queen Mary's secretary.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.634
The Italian. Well,
I don't know how you found me,

31:10.636 --> 31:13.103
but I do not work
for your queen.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.571
I serve King Darnley.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.540
And until I hear from him,

31:16.542 --> 31:18.909
these men are
not going anywhere.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.378
RIZZIO:
Lord Barrett, let me explain

31:21.380 --> 31:23.013
the royal hierarchy, hmm?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.548
You see, Darnley is only
king consort,

31:24.550 --> 31:26.483
so he has no...
(spits)

31:27.653 --> 31:29.286
Ah!

31:29.288 --> 31:32.422
(grunt)
Maybe you didn't hear my friend.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.558
The mission is aborted!

31:34.560 --> 31:36.493
Now, where is Mary's seal?

31:36.495 --> 31:39.396
(grunts)
I don't have it.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.265
(grunting)

31:41.267 --> 31:44.067
Lie to me again, and I will open
you up, right here

31:44.069 --> 31:46.103
in your own house.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.445
RIZZIO: Gentlemen.
Please load Queen Mary's gold

31:55.447 --> 31:57.514
onto the carriage
and mount your horses.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.317
We're going home.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.486
(dog barking)

32:04.423 --> 32:06.423
SCOTTISH SOLDIER:
Lord Bothwell.

32:06.425 --> 32:10.294
We found him spying
on us. He's alone.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.362
You shouldn't have come here,
Gideon. We had a deal.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.398
Yes. You told me
this threat against Mary

32:14.400 --> 32:15.532
didn't concern Elizabeth.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.234
I just wanted
to see for myself.

32:17.236 --> 32:20.237
And how much did you see?

32:20.239 --> 32:21.972
What do you want me to say?

32:21.974 --> 32:23.607
(grunts)
Bothwell.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.475
He's seen too much. He's
going to report Mary's plan

32:25.477 --> 32:26.476
back to Elizabeth.

32:26.478 --> 32:27.711
It's not your
call, Bothwell,

32:27.713 --> 32:29.179
it's Queen Mary's.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.281
You're right.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.018
Take him with us.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.087
♪ ♪

32:46.432 --> 32:48.565
Is something wrong,
Your Majesty?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.067
No.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.568
I just sent for
one of my servants

32:51.570 --> 32:54.638
to retrieve a blanket
against the cold.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.709
Did you find Gideon?

32:58.711 --> 33:00.444
No, Your Majesty.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.012
I've asked every servant
on the grounds.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.047
They say he left hours ago.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.549
Any word on where he went?

33:05.551 --> 33:07.317
(whispering):
No.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.254
(grunts)

33:13.292 --> 33:14.758
Mary?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.560
It's all right, Gideon.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.028
You're in Scotland.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.496
Scotland?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.598
No, no, no.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.601
I've got to get back.
No. You can't leave.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.670
You have information that can't
get back to my cousin.

33:26.672 --> 33:30.007
Are you going to kill me, Mary?

33:30.009 --> 33:32.609
I need you to understand
that I am no longer

33:32.611 --> 33:34.544
pursuing Elizabeth's throne.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.480
Really? You're just giving up
on England?

33:36.482 --> 33:38.582
I can't worry
about England anymore.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.584
I have enemies here in Scotland

33:40.586 --> 33:43.687
who are seeking to destroy me
and take my crown.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.390
I thought my husband would...

33:46.392 --> 33:47.624
would be my ally,

33:47.626 --> 33:51.495
but... he is a danger to me.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.131
Oh, Mary. I'm so sorry.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.466
But you were planning
to move on Elizabeth.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.701
Soldiers, the gold...

33:57.703 --> 33:59.236
She never needs to know.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.504
It didn't happen.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.538
It never happened, Gideon,

34:01.540 --> 34:03.206
because I stopped it.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.208
Gideon, after all
we've been through,

34:05.210 --> 34:09.579
I must ask you to bend
the rules one last time.

34:09.581 --> 34:13.050
Promise me you're no longer
a threat to her.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.618
I swear it.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.526
Release me, then,

34:22.528 --> 34:25.328
and Elizabeth will never
hear of what you did.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.065
You have my word.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.167
Thank you.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.744
You shouldn't have let him go.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.512
He gave me his word.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.315
And you gave yours.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.151
Have you truly abandoned your
pursuit of Elizabeth's throne?

34:48.153 --> 34:49.653
I don't know.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.822
I can't take England
with Darnley.

34:51.824 --> 34:54.791
And from here on out,
I must do everything in my power

34:54.793 --> 34:57.594
to keep this disastrous marriage
from ruining me.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.296
You warned me not to marry

34:59.298 --> 35:01.565
Darnley and I should have
listened to you.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.502
I am so...

35:05.504 --> 35:07.838
tired of thinking about him.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.643
You once told me that you
weren't as strong as I thought.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.345
But you are.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.750
I am married.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.752
And a queen.

35:22.754 --> 35:26.123
And you can't afford
to make a mistake.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.904
It's a lovely
day outside,

35:40.906 --> 35:43.540
you should get some fresh air.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.442
You're upset.

35:45.444 --> 35:46.710
Where's Nicole?

35:46.712 --> 35:50.213
Doesn't she usually
lift your spirits?

35:50.215 --> 35:52.382
I don't know where she's gone.
What Henri said,

35:52.384 --> 35:53.884
about Spain...

35:53.886 --> 35:57.320
(sighs) Put his nonsense
out of your mind.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.755
No. Tell me the truth.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.857
Do they really want Henri
to take my place?

36:00.859 --> 36:02.259
Charles, you know...

36:02.261 --> 36:04.594
I am anointed by God.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.730
And if Spain really wants
to see the rightful

36:06.732 --> 36:09.666
King of France deposed,

36:09.668 --> 36:11.868
they'll have to kill me.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.641
Charles.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.675
I would never let that happen.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.876
Ever.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.545
You are my son.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.529
And you are going
to prove stronger

36:39.531 --> 36:41.798
than anyone ever imagined.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.637
(speaking in Latin)

36:56.615 --> 36:57.714
(gasps)

37:14.833 --> 37:17.901
Next time you go drinking
in Cornwall with your friends,

37:17.903 --> 37:20.437
you should tell me.
Hmm.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.440
You just disappeared,
and I thought...

37:23.442 --> 37:24.908
What?

37:26.678 --> 37:29.813
I thought maybe our relationship
had grown too painful.

37:29.815 --> 37:30.947
Elizabeth...

37:30.949 --> 37:32.716
Just listen.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.951
I just spent hours
in a carriage

37:34.953 --> 37:37.487
with a man who is kind
and handsome,

37:37.489 --> 37:39.489
and I kept thinking to myself,

37:39.491 --> 37:42.292
how can I spend a life
with someone I don't love,

37:42.294 --> 37:44.861
when the man who means

37:44.863 --> 37:47.697
everything to me
will be kept at a distance?

37:47.699 --> 37:50.567
And I realized I can't.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.470
I'm not gonna marry him, Gideon.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.941
But you have to.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.576
What?

37:59.578 --> 38:01.311
No, I don't.

38:01.313 --> 38:04.347
I wasn't drinking in a tavern.

38:04.349 --> 38:06.983
I was working with Mary.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.952
Mary.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.821
What happened?

38:11.823 --> 38:13.823
There was a threat
of a Catholic coup

38:13.825 --> 38:15.759
against you.

38:15.761 --> 38:19.729
Mary asked me to help
prevent it, and I... and I did.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.666
Who else was involved?

38:22.668 --> 38:24.901
Catholics who wanted to see
Mary on your throne,

38:24.903 --> 38:26.903
but... but she called it off.

38:26.905 --> 38:30.073
There was a threat
of a coup forming?

38:30.075 --> 38:33.977
Are you really going
to continue to defend my rival?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.745
No. I'm not.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.851
You were right. As
long as Mary's alive,

38:41.853 --> 38:44.821
there will always be Catholics
who want her on your throne.

38:44.823 --> 38:49.092
Unless you share it with
someone of their faith.

38:49.094 --> 38:53.330
To stay alive, you must
marry the archduke.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.343
What's Bothwell doing here?

39:06.345 --> 39:07.877
I banished him from court.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.846
And I invited him back.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.881
He's now
my bodyguard.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.616
And Rizzio is my new adviser.

39:13.618 --> 39:15.385
How lovely for the three of you.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.420
Why did you send
for me, Mary?

39:17.422 --> 39:18.988
Is it because you've
rethought your decision?

39:18.990 --> 39:21.091
If so, I am more than willing
to do my part

39:21.093 --> 39:23.460
to move forward in peace.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.462
Together,
we can still take England.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.797
No, Darnley. We can't.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.070
My seal.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.373
Safely retrieved
from England.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.640
Along with my gold

39:37.642 --> 39:39.008
and my countrymen.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.411
Could we, uh...

39:41.413 --> 39:44.013
speak alone?

39:44.015 --> 39:45.882
No.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.751
Mary, please.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.419
We both know that things
got out of hand

39:49.421 --> 39:51.087
last night,
but believe me,

39:51.089 --> 39:53.056
I am sorry.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.092
It's too late for apologies,
Darnley.

39:56.094 --> 40:00.430
The threats you made
can never be taken back.

40:00.432 --> 40:01.798
And they will
never be forgiven.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.833
I lost my temper.

40:03.835 --> 40:05.835
We both know I didn't
mean what I said.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.138
I-I would never
betray you to Elizabeth.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.640
We are finished, Darnley.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.846
Well, that's it, then.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.518
You win.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.455
But I never really had a chance,
did I?

40:25.457 --> 40:27.924
I gave you every chance!

40:27.926 --> 40:29.492
You're the one
sitting on the throne.

40:29.494 --> 40:33.062
I am your king
in name only.

40:33.064 --> 40:36.633
Not a real king, and I'm
certainly not a real husband.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.601
But, if that's
what you want,

40:38.603 --> 40:40.937
then from now on,
I will do nothing but drink

40:40.939 --> 40:44.441
and whore my way
through Scotland.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.875
Bothwell. Arrest him.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.478
You can't arrest me,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.613
Mary. Have you forgotten
that the child

40:50.615 --> 40:53.049
in your belly needs a father?

41:00.192 --> 41:01.891
Oh, you didn't know.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.027
All I have to do

41:04.029 --> 41:06.663
is say that that child
isn't mine,

41:06.665 --> 41:09.566
and you and your heir
will both pay the price.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.901
You would condemn
your own child?

41:11.903 --> 41:13.937
And who would believe you?

41:13.939 --> 41:16.072
Any man would.

41:17.709 --> 41:22.045
You and your new bodyguard
seem very close.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.481
You're trying to take
all my power away.

41:25.951 --> 41:29.219
But I'm still your husband,

41:29.221 --> 41:32.255
and I still have
the power to ruin you.

41:32.257 --> 41:33.857
Get out of my sight.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.592
Get out!
