00:39.709 --> 00:40.834
It's locked.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.475
When the door opens, you can go in first.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.543
- I know you were here first.
- Doesn't matter.

00:49.578 --> 00:51.445
If it didn't matter,
you wouldn't be here first.

00:52.515 --> 00:53.714
Did it start?

00:53.749 --> 00:54.948
It starts at 8:00.

00:54.984 --> 00:56.850
It's 8:00.
- It's 7:00.

00:58.487 --> 01:00.053
Ahh.

01:02.791 --> 01:04.024
What is that?

01:04.059 --> 01:05.893
Breakfast taco. Austin-style.

01:05.928 --> 01:08.061
- Scrambled eggs, onions...
- You're not allowed to eat in here.

01:08.096 --> 01:09.787
- Why not?
- Because you're not allowed

01:09.822 --> 01:11.538
to eat in here. There's a sign out front.

01:11.573 --> 01:13.133
I didn't see a sign.

01:13.168 --> 01:14.901
Ignorance is no excuse.

01:14.936 --> 01:17.837
You're a prosecutor, aren't you?

01:19.041 --> 01:20.640
Why don't you eat that over there?

01:20.675 --> 01:22.142
Why? Because I'm a public defender,

01:22.177 --> 01:23.376
or because of the <i> migas?</i>

01:23.412 --> 01:24.810
Do I have to choose?

01:39.027 --> 01:40.593
Why didn't you get me up this morning?

01:40.628 --> 01:41.761
I wanted to come down with you.

01:41.796 --> 01:42.961
I got up at 4:30.

01:42.996 --> 01:45.264
It would literally be impossible
for me to thank you enough

01:45.299 --> 01:47.433
for not getting me up.

01:47.468 --> 01:49.234
Where's your boyfriend?

01:49.270 --> 01:51.103
I have no boyfriend today.

01:51.138 --> 01:52.404
And Seth has no girlfriend.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.805
We're keeping this professional.

02:09.089 --> 02:12.633
Uh, hey. She was here first.

02:12.669 --> 02:16.260
Oh. I didn't realize.

02:17.878 --> 02:20.178
Assistant United States
Attorneys to the right.

02:20.214 --> 02:22.614
Federal Public Defenders to the left.

02:22.649 --> 02:23.848
You can sit together if you like,

02:23.884 --> 02:27.519
but if I've learned anything
after 27 years of doing this,

02:27.554 --> 02:29.955
it's that you don't like to sit together.

02:29.990 --> 02:35.259
This is the swearing in
for incoming AUSAs and FPDs.

02:35.295 --> 02:36.509
Please check your ticket.

02:36.544 --> 02:38.563
Make sure you're on the right flight.

02:38.598 --> 02:40.231
My name is Tina Krissman.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.457
I am the clerk of court,

02:41.492 --> 02:42.801
I am on the second floor
of this building,

02:42.836 --> 02:44.869
and I am available every day

02:44.905 --> 02:47.906
from 7:50 a.m. to 4:40 p.m.

02:47.941 --> 02:52.030
to ignore your questions.

02:53.146 --> 02:54.745
I smell onions.

03:00.019 --> 03:02.124
I will find you.

03:03.022 --> 03:05.889
Chief Judge Nicholas Byrne.

03:08.961 --> 03:10.794
There are two great courts in America...

03:10.830 --> 03:12.010
the Supreme Court,

03:12.045 --> 03:14.631
and the one you're sitting in right now.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.934
This is the United States District Court

03:16.969 --> 03:18.669
for the Southern District of New York...

03:18.704 --> 03:20.737
the oldest, most prestigious,

03:20.773 --> 03:23.573
highest-profile trial court in America.

03:23.608 --> 03:24.807
This is the court that heard claims

03:24.843 --> 03:26.943
over the sinking of the <i> Titanic.</i>

03:26.979 --> 03:29.912
This is the court that heard
the case against the Rosenbergs.

03:29.948 --> 03:33.916
Aaron Burr was a lawyer in this court.

03:35.988 --> 03:37.787
Are you worthy?

03:37.822 --> 03:40.422
You've probably heard that some
people call this the "Mother Court."

03:40.458 --> 03:44.827
For as long as you work here,
you will call it home.

03:44.863 --> 03:46.996
The cases are hard, the stakes are high,

03:47.031 --> 03:50.032
the lawyers on the other side
are better than you,

03:50.067 --> 03:53.503
and the judges are smarter than you.

03:53.538 --> 03:55.637
Some of you...

03:55.672 --> 03:57.139
won't succeed.

03:57.174 --> 03:59.174
Some of you...

03:59.210 --> 04:01.043
are <i> not</i> worthy.

04:01.078 --> 04:03.312
But for those of you who are,

04:03.347 --> 04:07.049
your time here will be
the highlight of your career.

04:10.888 --> 04:14.890
"I do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend

04:14.925 --> 04:17.158
the Constitution of the United States,

04:17.192 --> 04:19.528
that I will bear
true faith and allegiance

04:19.563 --> 04:21.396
to the Government of the United States,

04:21.430 --> 04:24.799
that I will maintain the respect
due to the Courts of Justice

04:24.835 --> 04:26.367
and the Judicial Officers,

04:26.403 --> 04:28.569
and that I will demean myself
as an attorney,

04:28.604 --> 04:32.306
proctor, advocate, and counselor
of this Court uprightly,

04:32.342 --> 04:35.076
according to law, so help me God."

04:35.111 --> 04:37.678
Welcome to the Mother Court.

04:52.194 --> 04:54.528
Good morning, everyone. I'm Jill Carlan.

04:54.564 --> 04:56.163
I'm the Federal Public Defender.

04:56.198 --> 04:59.066
Inside these envelopes
is your first case,

04:59.101 --> 05:00.833
and let me warn you...

05:00.869 --> 05:02.436
You're not gonna win.

05:02.471 --> 05:04.337
You're up against
the United States government,

05:04.373 --> 05:06.039
and the government almost always wins

05:06.075 --> 05:07.607
because they have all the power.

05:07.642 --> 05:09.042
Now, here's the good news.

05:09.078 --> 05:12.112
You don't need to win. You need <i> a</i> win.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.349
Reduce the charge,

05:13.385 --> 05:15.882
get a piece of critical
testimony thrown out,

05:15.917 --> 05:17.784
get your client released on bail...

05:17.819 --> 05:18.918
get something.

05:18.954 --> 05:20.053
If you can do that, you've won.

05:20.088 --> 05:23.422
And I know you can do that.
Or you wouldn't be here.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.939
My name is Roger Gunn.

05:31.666 --> 05:33.525
I am your boss.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.435
This is your first case.

05:36.471 --> 05:38.036
I expect you to win.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.148
I got a good one. What'd you score?

05:49.183 --> 05:51.883
- Terrorism.
- Terrorism.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.151
Sweet.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.352
Nail it.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.159
What's "duty"?

06:01.194 --> 06:04.329
The attorney on duty picks up
the new cases that come in.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.487
Do you need someone today?

06:05.522 --> 06:07.332
Yes, but you have to have some experience

06:07.367 --> 06:09.334
to be on duty, Sandra. I have experience.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.636
You have experience clerking
on the Supreme Court,

06:11.671 --> 06:12.763
which is great experience

06:12.798 --> 06:15.140
for being a Justice on the Supreme Court.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.674
Doesn't have anything to do
with this job.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.975
I'll put you on duty when you're ready.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.161
I'm ready.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.648
Okay. You're on duty.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.182
Great.

06:25.217 --> 06:26.784
Thank you.

06:26.819 --> 06:27.952
So, what do I do?

06:27.987 --> 06:29.086
Use your experience.

06:33.225 --> 06:34.358
It's okay. I like a challenge.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.660
You're the only person I've ever met

06:35.695 --> 06:36.761
who goes out of her way to make

06:36.796 --> 06:38.462
an extremely hard job even harder.

06:38.497 --> 06:40.030
Do you at least recognize
how weird that is?

06:40.065 --> 06:42.032
I do.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.100
See, I'm happy with my envelope.

06:44.136 --> 06:46.637
- What did you get?
- Ah, some trumped-up fraud charge.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.938
I figure I could either
read the lies from the AUSA

06:48.974 --> 06:50.207
or talk to my client.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.808
- Mm.
- I trust my client.

06:51.843 --> 06:52.856
You two know each other from law school?

06:52.892 --> 06:54.478
Yeah, first day. Torts. Front row.

06:54.513 --> 06:57.147
Ah. Too close for torts, but that's cool.

06:57.182 --> 06:59.049
- Where you living in the city?
- Upper East Side.

06:59.084 --> 07:00.483
Ah. Less cool all of a sudden.

07:00.518 --> 07:02.052
It's her place. I'm just squatting there.

07:11.763 --> 07:13.329
You don't mess around.

07:13.364 --> 07:15.665
I have a bail hearing.
Why would I be messing around?

07:15.700 --> 07:18.234
No, I-I just meant... the...

07:18.269 --> 07:21.704
Doesn't matter. Uh, I heard
you were a procedural guru.

07:21.739 --> 07:23.506
- Can I ask you a question?
- If you have to,

07:23.541 --> 07:24.807
but I don't want to be the help desk

07:24.842 --> 07:27.710
for every man in this office too lazy
to look something up for himself.

07:27.745 --> 07:30.179
Were you too lazy to look
this up for yourself?

07:30.214 --> 07:32.247
I can look this up myself.

07:32.282 --> 07:35.718
If it's about your terrorism case,

07:35.753 --> 07:37.252
you shouldn't waste your time.

07:37.287 --> 07:38.386
Why not?

07:38.422 --> 07:40.488
Um, because I don't think
that's gonna be your case

07:40.524 --> 07:42.224
for very much longer.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.860
Why would I give you his case?

07:44.895 --> 07:46.428
Because a farm animal
could win this case,

07:46.463 --> 07:47.895
and that case actually matters,

07:47.931 --> 07:49.431
and if it matters,
you should give it to me.

07:49.466 --> 07:51.099
When I was clerking on the Supreme Court,

07:51.134 --> 07:52.066
this kid was writing research memos

07:52.102 --> 07:54.769
for junior partners
at a mid-tier law firm.

07:54.804 --> 07:57.004
Is that true?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.840
Leonard doesn't think
you're ready for this case.

07:58.875 --> 07:59.841
Well, he's right.

07:59.876 --> 08:01.843
Neither one of us is ready
for a case like this,

08:01.878 --> 08:03.611
but I'm at least humble enough
to recognize it,

08:03.646 --> 08:05.510
and I'll work that much harder
because of it.

08:15.091 --> 08:17.125
Never been a fan of humility.

08:22.498 --> 08:24.265
- He took your case?
- Stole it.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.332
- Stole it?
- That's what I'm saying.

08:25.368 --> 08:27.534
And then he said I worked
at a "mid-tier law firm."

08:27.570 --> 08:29.236
I did not work at a mid-tier law firm.

08:30.573 --> 08:32.873
Okay. That doesn't help.

08:32.908 --> 08:35.241
Don't worry about the case, Seth. Don't.

08:35.277 --> 08:37.811
Do a good job on your new case,
and you'll get recognized

08:37.846 --> 08:39.645
because you're good and decent,

08:39.681 --> 08:41.581
and you do things the right way,

08:41.616 --> 08:43.817
which is what matters
in the long run, okay?

08:43.852 --> 08:45.551
Okay?

08:45.587 --> 08:48.288
Now, I have to go because
<i>I</i> have my first appearance

08:48.323 --> 08:51.124
as an attorney in the
Southern District of New York.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.224
So do I.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.893
Well, let's go kick some ass then.

09:13.881 --> 09:16.081
Ms. Krissman.

09:16.117 --> 09:18.851
I'm Sandra Bell from the FPD.
I'm on duty today.

09:22.223 --> 09:27.292
So, uh, if any cases come in,
I will be right here.

09:27.328 --> 09:28.694
That's not a great place to be,

09:28.729 --> 09:30.995
because when cases come in,
I e-mail them to you,

09:31.031 --> 09:32.798
which is what I did 15 minutes ago.

09:32.833 --> 09:33.878
I don't have any service here.

09:33.913 --> 09:35.600
Then you probably don't know
that your hearing

09:35.636 --> 09:37.502
starts in eight minutes.

09:37.538 --> 09:40.305
Courtroom 601. Avoid the elevator.
Take the stairs.

09:40.341 --> 09:42.907
And be grateful you called me
Ms. Krissman.

09:57.023 --> 10:00.023
I'm Sandra Bell. I'm your attorney.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.692
Mohammed Fayed.

10:06.232 --> 10:08.298
What's the charge?

10:08.334 --> 10:10.368
18 USC 2332.

10:10.403 --> 10:11.395
You pick this up on duty?

10:11.431 --> 10:13.404
- Yes.
- Tough day to be on duty.

10:13.439 --> 10:14.724
2332 is attempted...

10:14.749 --> 10:16.340
"Attempted use of a weapon
of mass destruction

10:16.375 --> 10:18.041
against any property
that is owned, leased, or used

10:18.077 --> 10:20.143
by the United States
or by any department or agency

10:20.179 --> 10:21.356
of the United States." I know.

10:21.391 --> 10:23.413
What was my client allegedly
attempting to destroy?

10:23.448 --> 10:25.515
Leonard Knox.

10:25.550 --> 10:26.690
Sandra Bell.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.218
All rise!

10:28.254 --> 10:30.653
Your client tried to blow up the
Statue of Liberty, Sandra Bell.

10:43.472 --> 10:45.139
Your Honor, as alleged in the complaint,

10:45.174 --> 10:47.108
Madeline Locarno was
an administrative assistant

10:47.143 --> 10:49.143
at Alaria Pharmaceuticals

10:49.178 --> 10:51.212
and illegally traded
on inside information

10:51.247 --> 10:53.847
regarding a merger between
Alaria and Biogene...

10:53.882 --> 10:55.115
Excuse me, Your Honor, but the complaint

10:55.150 --> 10:57.016
actually does not allege that.

10:57.052 --> 10:59.052
It alleges that Ms. Locarno
passed on information

10:59.087 --> 11:01.555
to her ex-husband,
who executed the trades...

11:01.590 --> 11:02.723
facts which we deny.

11:02.758 --> 11:04.057
What was the value of the trades?

11:04.092 --> 11:07.294
$9,325.54, Your Honor.

11:07.329 --> 11:09.162
$9,000?

11:11.666 --> 11:13.900
This is what Roger Gunn is prioritizing

11:13.935 --> 11:16.102
in the U.S. Attorney's Office nowadays?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.332
I thought that was fun.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.307
Fun? We have to get out of this.

11:21.342 --> 11:23.076
So talk to Gunn. Get off the case.

11:23.111 --> 11:26.579
Your Honor, this is a minor fraud charge,

11:26.614 --> 11:29.047
and we're simply asking
for reasonable bail

11:29.083 --> 11:30.650
so that my client, Adam Dyle,

11:30.685 --> 11:32.551
can continue to care
for his twin brother,

11:32.587 --> 11:34.987
who is dying of cancer.

11:39.594 --> 11:41.193
I find myself

11:41.228 --> 11:44.229
unexpectedly moved by defense counsel...

11:45.099 --> 11:46.498
to indignation.

11:46.533 --> 11:48.366
Adam Dyle's brother
isn't dying of cancer,

11:48.402 --> 11:50.235
because he doesn't exist.

11:50.271 --> 11:53.172
Nor really does Adam Dyle,
which isn't that man's name.

11:53.207 --> 11:55.073
His name is Matthew Ormond. Or wait.

11:55.109 --> 11:57.242
No, it's Baron Heinz Geinecke. I'm sorry.

11:57.278 --> 12:00.211
Did I say Baron Heinz Geinecke?
I meant Abigail Konogo.

12:00.246 --> 12:03.214
It really depends on
what con he's running.

12:03.249 --> 12:05.750
They're not hard to track down,
if you do a little work.

12:05.786 --> 12:08.353
Mr. Dyle is charged with
creating the absurdly named

12:08.388 --> 12:09.621
and entirely fake

12:09.656 --> 12:12.223
"United States Bureau of Organization"

12:12.258 --> 12:14.859
to issue fake
governmental purchase orders,

12:14.894 --> 12:16.961
with which he swindled
hundreds of thousands of dollars

12:16.996 --> 12:18.896
of very real money

12:18.932 --> 12:21.365
from small businesses
all over the New York area.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.234
It's enough to...

12:25.504 --> 12:27.272
Well, to make you sick.

12:31.144 --> 12:33.377
Please advise the court
if there any plea discussions.

12:33.412 --> 12:34.511
We're already talking, Your Honor.

12:34.547 --> 12:37.280
Talking? What are we talking about?

12:37.316 --> 12:39.616
I'm offering you 15 years
as opposed to life.

12:39.652 --> 12:41.418
See? Talking.

12:41.454 --> 12:43.153
I haven't seen the discovery yet.

12:43.188 --> 12:44.788
Once we get bogged down in discovery,

12:44.824 --> 12:46.890
it's hard to get a deal done.

12:46.925 --> 12:48.291
It's hard for me to get a deal done

12:48.327 --> 12:49.459
when I don't know
what's in the discovery.

12:49.494 --> 12:51.661
Listen, you seem bright, and
you got dealt a bad hand here,

12:51.696 --> 12:53.129
and I'm sorry about that. I really am.

12:53.165 --> 12:56.166
I feel... bad for you,
but don't make it worse.

12:56.201 --> 12:58.235
Because here's the thing you
need to understand about me...

12:58.270 --> 13:00.237
I'm the guy who makes it worse.

13:00.272 --> 13:02.172
I'm the guy you don't want
to go up against.

13:02.207 --> 13:04.074
I didn't stumble into this case.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.976
I saw it, I wanted it, and I took it.

13:07.011 --> 13:09.689
Now I'm offering you a way
to get out of it.

13:11.115 --> 13:13.483
If they're offering a deal
like that in a case like this,

13:13.518 --> 13:15.351
there must be something wrong
with the evidence.

13:15.387 --> 13:17.152
Maybe. But if you want to find out,

13:17.188 --> 13:18.220
you're gonna have to reject the offer,

13:18.256 --> 13:20.289
and if you reject the offer,
you're going to trial.

13:20.324 --> 13:22.524
And if you go to trial,
you're going to lose.

13:22.559 --> 13:24.159
A big loss in a big case.

13:24.195 --> 13:25.494
I can give it to someone else.

13:25.529 --> 13:27.129
No.

13:27.164 --> 13:28.364
Do you follow baseball?

13:28.399 --> 13:29.799
- Uh...
- In 1993,

13:29.834 --> 13:32.167
the San Francisco Giants won
a record 103 games,

13:32.203 --> 13:34.136
but they still had to win
the final game of the season

13:34.171 --> 13:35.271
to make the playoffs.

13:35.306 --> 13:39.107
They had two experienced
20-game winners on their staff,

13:39.142 --> 13:41.405
but the manager decided
to start Salomon Torres,

13:41.440 --> 13:42.878
a 21-year-old rookie

13:42.913 --> 13:44.846
who'd only been pitching in
the major leagues for a month.

13:44.882 --> 13:46.180
You've never been to a game?

13:46.216 --> 13:48.316
A-A few times.

13:48.351 --> 13:49.651
Huh.

13:49.686 --> 13:52.053
Anyway, he got destroyed.

13:52.088 --> 13:54.689
Gave up 3 runs, 5 hits,
walked 5 in 3 innings.

13:54.725 --> 13:56.124
The Giants lost,

13:56.159 --> 13:57.959
didn't make the playoffs
for four more years,

13:57.994 --> 13:59.961
and Torres went on
to a forgettable career.

13:59.996 --> 14:01.396
He never lived that game down.

14:01.431 --> 14:04.632
Is that how you want
to start <i> your</i> career?

14:04.667 --> 14:07.302
Talk to your client about the deal.

14:10.273 --> 14:12.084
I'm really disappointed.

14:13.008 --> 14:16.209
In you. Specifically.

14:16.245 --> 14:17.319
Okay.

14:17.354 --> 14:20.213
Well, thank you for being specific.

14:20.249 --> 14:22.382
Did you not like the way I told the judge

14:22.418 --> 14:25.052
about your fake brother dying
of fake cancer or...

14:25.087 --> 14:27.421
Look, I was just following
Bureau protocol.

14:27.457 --> 14:28.503
And if we're ever confronted,

14:28.539 --> 14:30.490
we're supposed to protect our identity.

14:30.525 --> 14:33.360
People have a lot of hostility
about the work we do.

14:34.529 --> 14:36.997
These purchase orders were
for a technology upgrade.

14:37.032 --> 14:39.566
Why didn't you tell the judge
we're entitled to an upgrade?

14:40.571 --> 14:44.438
You really believe the Bureau
of Organization exists?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.440
What do you mean? Of course it exists.
I work there.

14:49.277 --> 14:51.243
The offer is 15.

14:51.279 --> 14:52.980
I'm not saying I can get to 10,

14:53.015 --> 14:54.832
but... if I can.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.883
Wait. 10 years in jail, right?

14:56.918 --> 14:58.250
Yes.

14:58.286 --> 14:59.686
Jail.

14:59.721 --> 15:01.354
Federal prison.

15:08.896 --> 15:11.763
What are the others getting?

15:11.799 --> 15:13.132
Others?

15:13.167 --> 15:14.967
What others?

15:15.003 --> 15:16.869
Th-The team.

15:18.839 --> 15:19.950
I'm not getting off the case.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.010
Well, I'm not asking you
to get off the case.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.908
I'm just saying that
I'm not getting off the case.

15:22.943 --> 15:24.309
The $9,000 case?

15:24.344 --> 15:26.812
Yeah, the one against the woman
who broke the law?

15:26.847 --> 15:28.380
That one? Yes.

15:28.415 --> 15:29.982
Well, it's not a problem for me.

15:30.017 --> 15:31.539
Great.

15:32.319 --> 15:34.452
It could be a problem for you.

15:34.488 --> 15:37.389
Why? Oh, right. Right.

15:37.424 --> 15:38.556
Because you think you're gonna beat me.

15:38.591 --> 15:39.624
You heard what the judge said.

15:39.659 --> 15:42.427
The lawyers on the other side
are better than you.

15:42.462 --> 15:44.595
He said that to both sides.

15:44.631 --> 15:46.731
He was looking at your side more.

15:46.766 --> 15:48.099
His head was turned towards you.

15:48.135 --> 15:49.473
Mm.

15:52.605 --> 15:54.805
We <i> can</i> do this, right?

15:54.841 --> 15:57.441
We can do this.

15:58.978 --> 16:00.377
And I can do this.

16:04.483 --> 16:05.616
Al?

16:05.652 --> 16:09.353
I didn't hear you come home.

16:09.388 --> 16:11.522
Are you okay?

16:11.557 --> 16:13.390
I'm gonna do this.

16:17.563 --> 16:19.763
You know how we've always said
that if one of us

16:19.798 --> 16:21.631
is about to do something really risky

16:21.667 --> 16:22.799
but she really believes in it,

16:22.834 --> 16:26.937
then the other will be there
to support her no matter what?

16:26.972 --> 16:28.538
We've never said that.

16:28.574 --> 16:30.139
Really?

16:30.175 --> 16:32.341
Okay, well, can you say it
to me now, please?

16:32.377 --> 16:33.944
What are you going to do, Sandra?

16:37.382 --> 16:38.548
Sandra Bell.

16:38.584 --> 16:40.016
Send over the discovery.

16:40.052 --> 16:40.983
You know what that means.

16:41.018 --> 16:43.352
It means you send over
the discovery right now.

16:43.388 --> 16:45.388
We are done talking.

16:45.423 --> 16:46.922
He's not taking the deal.

16:48.726 --> 16:51.494
I'm gonna save Mohammed Fayed.

16:59.173 --> 17:02.174
You rejected a plea deal
without talking to me.

17:02.210 --> 17:04.142
You said talk to my client.
I talked to my client.

17:04.176 --> 17:06.678
Well, you didn't talk to me,
and that was a mistake,

17:06.714 --> 17:08.614
and you can't afford
to make mistakes like that

17:08.648 --> 17:10.886
on a job like this.

17:10.911 --> 17:13.546
You better find something in these boxes.

17:16.522 --> 17:18.257
What did you want to talk about?

17:18.291 --> 17:20.324
Well, Kate, here's the problem. For you.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.358
My client,

17:21.394 --> 17:23.594
and let's keep it simple
and call him "Adam Dyle,"

17:23.630 --> 17:26.364
couldn't have committed
the alleged fraud because...

17:26.398 --> 17:29.600
as you probably have tabbed
there in one of your binders...

17:29.636 --> 17:32.670
fraud requires an intent to deceive,

17:32.705 --> 17:35.273
and Adam didn't intend to deceive anyone.

17:35.308 --> 17:38.175
Because he actually believes
all this is real.

17:38.210 --> 17:39.677
Crazy? Possibly.

17:39.712 --> 17:44.114
But the upshot is, no intent, no crime.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.798
So...

17:46.886 --> 17:48.686
let's work something out here.

17:48.721 --> 17:51.188
Are you done?

17:51.223 --> 17:53.523
I had some other cool points
to make, but, yeah, sure.

17:55.727 --> 17:58.295
<i>Yeah, he's buying the whole thing.</i>

17:58.330 --> 17:59.997
<i> Yeah, everything.</i>
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

18:00.032 --> 18:02.900
<i>The Bureau. The technology upgrade.</i>

18:02.935 --> 18:04.701
<i>Yeah, I've gone full
"Primal Fear" on him.</i>

18:04.736 --> 18:07.204
<i> Yeah, this guy's a real tool.</i>

18:07.239 --> 18:09.339
Tab Four of my discovery guide...

18:09.374 --> 18:11.308
request jailhouse recordings.

18:13.878 --> 18:16.179
Did you still want to make one
of your cool points?

18:19.451 --> 18:21.150
And now she's got the discovery.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.218
You know what's in the discovery.

18:22.253 --> 18:25.054
You know what I know?
I know you wanted the case.

18:25.089 --> 18:27.223
So make the case.

18:27.258 --> 18:28.858
Or I could always give it back to <i> him.</i>

18:33.431 --> 18:35.764
Uh, actually, sir, can we talk?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.834
It's about opposing counsel

18:37.869 --> 18:39.268
- on the insider-trading case.
- Uh-huh.

18:39.304 --> 18:40.870
She's my girlfriend.
Does this story get even

18:40.905 --> 18:41.870
mildly interesting at some point?

18:41.905 --> 18:43.405
- Well, we live together.
- Apparently it doesn't.

18:43.441 --> 18:46.241
I need to be reassigned.

18:46.276 --> 18:48.276
'Cause of your boo?

18:48.312 --> 18:49.611
Her client can waive the conflict,

18:49.647 --> 18:50.579
if that's the problem.

18:50.614 --> 18:52.414
- Is that the problem?
- I just don't understand

18:52.450 --> 18:54.416
why we're prosecuting a case like this,

18:54.452 --> 18:58.186
against a secretary for a $9,000 trade?

18:58.222 --> 19:00.788
Well, that is a problem
that you don't understand that.

19:00.824 --> 19:03.291
So l-let me spell it out for you.

19:03.327 --> 19:05.927
You're prosecuting the case
'cause I told you to.

19:05.963 --> 19:07.295
And I told you to prosecute the case

19:07.331 --> 19:08.897
'cause that secretary broke the law.

19:08.932 --> 19:10.631
Every now and then,
regular, everyday people

19:10.667 --> 19:12.700
need to be reminded that
there's serious consequences

19:12.736 --> 19:14.035
to breaking the law. Whatever the law.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.904
Insider trading. Taxes. Stop signs.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.539
People start doing whatever
the hell they feel like,

19:18.575 --> 19:20.408
our whole system breaks down.

19:20.443 --> 19:23.411
Cars crash, Markets crash.
People get hurt.

19:23.446 --> 19:24.912
You understand that?

19:27.450 --> 19:29.817
I knew about the merger. We all did.

19:29.853 --> 19:32.119
Everyone in the company
was talking about it.

19:32.154 --> 19:35.622
I told my ex-husband, Eric,
I might be losing my job.

19:35.657 --> 19:37.324
Because I know sometimes,

19:37.360 --> 19:39.826
when these companies merge,
we lose our jobs.

19:40.871 --> 19:42.596
I have a daughter.

19:42.631 --> 19:44.831
And your ex-husband traded
on that information

19:44.867 --> 19:46.066
without your knowledge?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.461
I guess so.

19:48.303 --> 19:49.936
I never knew anything about it.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.272
I didn't get anything out of this.

19:59.147 --> 20:00.891
Are you kidding me?

20:02.434 --> 20:05.151
Motion to dismiss. It's good.

20:05.186 --> 20:06.319
And I'm not just complimenting

20:06.354 --> 20:07.620
your, uh... your girlfriend.

20:07.655 --> 20:08.487
If she can convince the judge

20:08.523 --> 20:10.023
there was no benefit to Ms. Locarno,

20:10.058 --> 20:11.357
then we lose the case.

20:11.393 --> 20:13.092
By which I mean, you lose this case.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.527
I don't have a response to this.

20:14.562 --> 20:16.162
Okay, first,

20:16.197 --> 20:17.696
don't ever say something
like that to your boss.

20:17.732 --> 20:19.265
Second, you don't need to respond.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.435
You need to make it irrelevant.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.602
Raise the stakes. Apply the pressure.

20:23.638 --> 20:25.103
You want to win, don't you?

20:25.139 --> 20:26.472
A superseding indictment.

20:26.507 --> 20:27.506
With three new charges

20:27.542 --> 20:29.708
that, together, could mean
significant jail time.

20:29.744 --> 20:31.544
It's good. Clever. Cruel.

20:31.579 --> 20:32.778
Vintage Roger Gunn.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.513
He's forcing you into a deal.

20:34.549 --> 20:35.648
This is how they win.

20:39.553 --> 20:41.686
I was never gonna prosecute
the additional charges.

20:41.721 --> 20:43.388
Is this supposed to make me
feel better about you?

20:43.424 --> 20:45.457
We needed to pressure you to make a deal.

20:45.492 --> 20:47.392
This is business. I did what I had to do.

20:47.428 --> 20:49.461
No, you did what your political,

20:49.496 --> 20:51.229
diabolical boss told you to do

20:51.265 --> 20:53.798
because you're insecure about
working at a mid-tier law firm.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.533
Mm! It was not mid-tier!

20:55.569 --> 20:56.501
Why are you making this
personal, Allison?

20:56.536 --> 20:58.903
It <i> is</i> personal! This is personal.

20:58.939 --> 21:01.539
She's a person.
Her name is Madeline Locarno.

21:01.575 --> 21:03.541
She's 44. She has a child.

21:03.577 --> 21:06.243
And she'll go to jail.
Why are you doing this?

21:06.279 --> 21:08.580
Because I believe in it.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.647
Has that ever crossed your mind?

21:09.683 --> 21:11.915
That I might actually believe
in what I'm doing?

21:11.951 --> 21:13.417
That I might actually believe

21:13.453 --> 21:16.187
that Madeline Locarno broke the law

21:16.222 --> 21:18.422
and that there's some virtue
in enforcing the law?

21:18.458 --> 21:20.091
If you believed in what you're doing,

21:20.126 --> 21:21.525
you wouldn't be doing this.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.394
That's what I believe.

21:28.701 --> 21:31.034
Are you sleeping here? I'm sleeping here.

21:31.069 --> 21:32.603
- That bad?
- Worse.

21:32.638 --> 21:34.437
"There is some virtue
in enforcing the law."

21:34.473 --> 21:36.874
- Who says that?
- A prosecutor. He's a prosecutor.

21:36.909 --> 21:39.576
He's a good person. He used to be.

21:39.612 --> 21:40.677
He cried during "La La Land."

21:40.713 --> 21:42.278
Not the mark of a good person.

21:42.314 --> 21:43.213
How's it going here?

21:43.248 --> 21:46.516
I am two boxes away from getting fired.

21:49.954 --> 21:52.389
Are you at your limit here, Sandy?

21:52.424 --> 21:54.557
Yes, I am. I am at my limit.

21:54.592 --> 21:55.694
But that's where I need to be right now

21:55.719 --> 21:57.448
because that is where he needs me to be.

21:58.130 --> 22:01.931
Okay, well, let me tell you
where <i> I</i> need to be.

22:01.966 --> 22:06.402
I need to be drunk anywhere,
so let's compromise.

22:06.437 --> 22:09.038
We are working for two more hours,

22:09.073 --> 22:10.472
and then we're going to drink.

22:10.508 --> 22:12.642
And I will complain
mercilessly about Seth,

22:12.677 --> 22:13.576
and you will tell me to stop,
and I'll say,

22:13.611 --> 22:14.877
"Yes, you're right. Let's go play darts."

22:14.913 --> 22:16.245
Then we'll go play darts,

22:16.280 --> 22:17.479
and I'll be hitting
the bull's-eye every time...

22:17.515 --> 22:18.647
boom, boom, boom... and you'll wonder

22:18.682 --> 22:19.648
how I got so good at darts,
and I'll say it's because

22:19.683 --> 22:21.983
I'm imagining Seth's face
on the dart board.

22:24.855 --> 22:26.455
What?

22:26.490 --> 22:28.323
That "team" Fayed said
he was working with

22:28.359 --> 22:30.276
to blow up the Statue of Liberty?

22:30.312 --> 22:33.042
They were undercover FBI agents.

22:33.077 --> 22:34.495
This was a sting.

22:38.602 --> 22:40.301
There was a team of three agents.

22:40.336 --> 22:41.636
They had been working on him
for 18 months.

22:41.672 --> 22:43.905
Fayed was working was supposed to
carry what he thought was a bomb

22:43.941 --> 22:45.506
into the crown of the Statue
of Liberty in a camera,

22:45.542 --> 22:46.741
but he was mistakenly arrested

22:46.777 --> 22:48.142
by a National Park Service Ranger

22:48.178 --> 22:50.945
before he could get there.
What... What is this?

22:50.980 --> 22:52.947
Extra paper. Stuff it in your bag.

22:52.982 --> 22:54.648
You should always carry a lot of paper.

22:54.684 --> 22:57.618
They get worried you have
something they don't know about.

22:57.653 --> 22:58.686
You know what we're doing here, right?

22:58.721 --> 23:01.488
- No.
- Then watch.

23:01.523 --> 23:04.658
It's bad for this office.
It's bad for the FBI.

23:04.694 --> 23:06.493
Oh, now, see, alarm bells go off for me

23:06.528 --> 23:09.162
when Jill Carlan is worried
about what's good for the FBI.

23:09.198 --> 23:10.763
You can't win on entrapment, Jill.

23:10.799 --> 23:11.898
And we're not trying to.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.534
This case is about attempt,
and you can't prove attempt,

23:14.570 --> 23:17.309
because he was arrested before
he got to the Statue of Liberty.

23:17.344 --> 23:18.605
Attempt only requires the defendant

23:18.640 --> 23:20.707
to take a substantial step toward
the commission of a crime.

23:20.742 --> 23:22.375
He was on Liberty Island with a bomb.

23:22.411 --> 23:23.643
Then why was the plan always to wait

23:23.678 --> 23:24.844
to arrest him until he got to the crown?

23:24.879 --> 23:28.447
Because that's what you thought
you needed to prove attempt.

23:28.483 --> 23:30.182
They're young. They're hungry.
They're smart.

23:30.218 --> 23:32.551
Let them fight it out. Are we done here?

23:32.587 --> 23:34.687
No. We're not done.

23:35.355 --> 23:36.990
Oh, right.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.866
Yankees tickets?

23:47.901 --> 23:49.535
Third-base line.

23:49.570 --> 23:50.672
You're going to the game with him?

23:50.708 --> 23:52.571
We don't go together. We meet there.

23:52.607 --> 23:54.406
Sometimes we go together.

23:54.442 --> 23:55.474
He's the enemy.

23:55.510 --> 23:57.075
No, the Red Sox are the enemy.

23:57.111 --> 23:58.477
He's the adversary.

23:58.513 --> 24:00.578
So we came to pick up tickets?
That's what we were doing here?

24:00.614 --> 24:01.513
You weren't watching.

24:01.548 --> 24:03.015
They now think you're gonna
argue attempt,

24:03.050 --> 24:04.582
and they're gonna direct
a lot of resources

24:04.618 --> 24:06.551
in that direction, but that's a loser.

24:06.586 --> 24:08.386
This is an entrapment case,

24:08.421 --> 24:10.989
so make sure you have one.

24:11.025 --> 24:13.224
I'm going to trial.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.093
You're going to trial, Sandra.

24:27.928 --> 24:29.996
She was here first.

24:30.031 --> 24:31.230
I owe you one.

24:31.265 --> 24:34.199
Spicy lamb, cumin hand-pulled noodles.

24:34.234 --> 24:35.767
I'll have that, too.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.193
Is that the thing to get?

24:39.229 --> 24:41.339
No idea, but it's two blocks
from the courthouse,

24:41.375 --> 24:42.608
and it's lamb.

24:45.412 --> 24:48.046
You know you're part of an
important tradition in my life.

24:48.081 --> 24:49.515
I'm going to trial tomorrow,

24:49.550 --> 24:52.083
and my tradition is now to eat with you

24:52.119 --> 24:54.719
at Hand-Pulled Noodle House Number 3

24:54.754 --> 24:57.555
every night before
the first day of trial.

24:57.590 --> 24:59.024
Can you commit to that?

24:59.059 --> 25:01.926
My dad took me to Frimple's Diner

25:01.961 --> 25:03.495
before every high-school swim meet.

25:03.530 --> 25:05.497
I like a tradition.

25:07.394 --> 25:08.860
Yes.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.135
- Are you nervous?
- Is it that spicy?

25:16.342 --> 25:18.543
The trial.
Are you nervous about the trial?

25:18.578 --> 25:20.277
No.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.712
I'm not.

25:22.629 --> 25:23.878
I'm gonna win.

25:24.874 --> 25:26.408
That's what I'd be nervous about.

25:57.473 --> 26:01.108
Please tell the jury
what happened that morning.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.377
Well, I saw this young man
come off the ferry,

26:03.412 --> 26:04.611
carrying a camera.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.847
He was sweating, jittery.

26:06.882 --> 26:08.215
I asked to see his camera,

26:08.250 --> 26:11.051
and that's when I realized
it was... a bomb.

26:11.087 --> 26:13.487
A fake bomb made by the FBI.

26:13.522 --> 26:15.154
I didn't know that at the time.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.557
Were you aware at the time that,
in addition to making fake bombs,

26:17.593 --> 26:20.460
the FBI had been recruiting
Mr. Fayed for 18 months?

26:20.496 --> 26:22.095
- No, ma'am.
- That he has no history of violence?

26:22.130 --> 26:24.464
No history of terrorist affiliation?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.566
That the government
has no evidence indicating

26:26.602 --> 26:28.401
he's ever had any interest in terrorism

26:28.436 --> 26:31.037
prior to his being recruited
by this team of agents?

26:31.072 --> 26:32.505
No, ma'am.

26:35.576 --> 26:38.244
You're not arguing attempt.
You're arguing entrapment.

26:38.279 --> 26:41.547
Oh. I didn't realize.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.151
- She's relentless.
- Yes, I know.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.084
It's a problem.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.487
No, it's an answer. She likes to fight.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.890
I just need to give her
something else to fight about.

26:50.925 --> 26:52.224
Good. Problem solved.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.760
You work on the ferry

26:54.795 --> 26:57.229
taking visitors
to Liberty Island, Mr. Rocton?

26:57.264 --> 26:59.031
Yes, sir. I collect tickets.

26:59.066 --> 27:01.734
Do you recall seeing
the defendant on the ferry

27:01.769 --> 27:03.402
the morning of his arrest?

27:03.437 --> 27:05.203
I remember him well, sir.

27:09.043 --> 27:10.842
What the hell was the point of that?

27:10.877 --> 27:12.411
That.

27:12.446 --> 27:15.013
You remember Mr. Fayed well, sir?

27:15.049 --> 27:16.748
- Yes.
- Hmm. Really?

27:16.783 --> 27:18.050
How long have you worked on that ferry?

27:18.085 --> 27:21.252
- 19 years.
- 19 years. And how many ferries a day?

27:21.287 --> 27:22.787
25, 26.

27:22.822 --> 27:25.156
Thousands of ferries, tens
of thousands of visitors,

27:25.191 --> 27:27.705
and you want the jury to believe
that you remember my client?

27:27.710 --> 27:28.857
Not just remember him.

27:28.883 --> 27:30.595
- Remember him well?
- Yes.

27:30.630 --> 27:32.129
Well, unless your memory has been jogged

27:32.165 --> 27:33.798
- by the government, Mr. Rocton...
- Objection!

27:33.833 --> 27:35.599
...how could you possibly
remember my client at all?!

27:35.634 --> 27:38.936
Because I quit my job because
of him! That's how!

27:38.971 --> 27:42.540
Because that ferry he was on was
the last ferry I ever worked.

27:42.575 --> 27:46.743
I was down there on 9/11, ma'am.

27:46.779 --> 27:49.342
On the island. Right next to her.

27:49.377 --> 27:53.584
The idea that someone
would want to blow her up now?

27:55.688 --> 27:57.420
I remember.

27:59.658 --> 28:02.366
You never, ever ask a question
you don't know the answer to.

28:02.402 --> 28:04.006
- That was a mistake.
- The mistake...

28:04.042 --> 28:06.063
was getting baited into a fight.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.231
The mistake was asking
any questions at all.

28:08.266 --> 28:09.765
- This is war.
- It is.

28:09.801 --> 28:11.278
It is war.

28:11.313 --> 28:13.836
Which means you have
to pick your battles,

28:13.871 --> 28:15.771
point your weapon in the right direction,

28:15.796 --> 28:17.329
and know your enemy.

28:17.354 --> 28:21.557
And right now, your biggest enemy is you.

28:21.582 --> 28:24.316
You want to fight everyone
about everything

28:24.341 --> 28:25.907
and when you fight about everything,

28:25.932 --> 28:27.865
you end up fighting about nothing.

28:39.497 --> 28:41.020
You want me to plead guilty?

28:41.055 --> 28:44.166
No, but I don't want you to go
to jail for years,

28:44.201 --> 28:47.603
which is the risk if we reject
the deal and go to trial.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.505
How could you let this happen?

29:07.658 --> 29:09.090
<i>He's buying the whole thing.</i>

29:09.126 --> 29:10.474
<i> Yeah, everything.</i>
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

29:10.509 --> 29:13.628
<i>The Bureau. The technology upgrade.</i>

29:13.664 --> 29:15.530
<i>Yeah, I've gone full
"Primal Fear" on him.</i>

29:15.565 --> 29:17.731
<i> Yeah, this guy's a real tool.</i>

29:35.850 --> 29:39.386
I have to take the deal, Sandy.
I've tried everything.

29:40.188 --> 29:42.822
I'm sure there's another move.

29:42.857 --> 29:45.308
The thing is, the deal is good.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.960
Good for who?

29:48.262 --> 29:50.329
For her?

29:50.364 --> 29:51.597
Or for you?

29:51.632 --> 29:52.699
What does that mean?

29:52.734 --> 29:55.267
Six months in jail and a record
as a convicted felon?

29:55.303 --> 29:56.569
That's not good for anyone,

29:56.604 --> 29:58.604
especially a working-class single mother.

29:58.639 --> 30:00.573
Why are you lecturing me?

30:00.608 --> 30:02.874
Look, the only other move is highly risky

30:02.910 --> 30:05.611
and ethically questionable,
and it destroys Seth.

30:05.646 --> 30:08.247
I don't just beat him, I destroy him.

30:08.282 --> 30:10.333
It's the nuclear option.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.778
This is hard, okay?

30:14.315 --> 30:15.797
I know.

30:17.290 --> 30:19.858
I'm sorry.

30:21.609 --> 30:23.575
Wait. That's it?

30:23.611 --> 30:25.410
You're just gonna let me
off the hook that easy?

30:25.445 --> 30:27.045
No, I don't accept that.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.813
This is where you say,
"If it was anybody but Seth,

30:28.848 --> 30:30.081
I don't think you'd hesitate,"

30:30.117 --> 30:32.950
or, "I like the nuclear option."

30:36.089 --> 30:38.523
What happened in trial today?

30:38.558 --> 30:40.425
Something happened in trial today.

30:41.928 --> 30:44.951
I messed up today, Al.

30:45.398 --> 30:48.566
I messed up.

30:59.478 --> 31:02.379
I believe in you, Sandra Bell.

31:44.794 --> 31:47.128
We live in a dangerous time.

31:48.682 --> 31:51.332
I don't need to tell you that.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.668
Our enemies used to be overseas,

31:53.703 --> 31:56.837
and we could see them
in tanks and airplanes.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.172
They wore uniforms,

31:58.207 --> 32:01.508
and we fought them on battlefields.

32:02.070 --> 32:05.312
But now we're living on the battlefield,

32:05.347 --> 32:07.314
and we can't see the enemy.

32:07.349 --> 32:08.715
They look like us.

32:08.751 --> 32:11.844
They talk like us. They live
down the hallway from us.

32:11.869 --> 32:12.968
We only find out who they are

32:13.003 --> 32:16.004
and the damage they want to do
after they've done it.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.973
After they've shot up a nightclub.

32:18.008 --> 32:20.142
Or blown up a marathon.

32:20.177 --> 32:22.340
Or brought down a building.

32:23.047 --> 32:24.780
Or two.

32:24.815 --> 32:27.582
The only chance we have
to fight these enemies

32:27.618 --> 32:28.816
is to find out who they are

32:28.852 --> 32:31.419
before they do these terrible things,

32:31.455 --> 32:33.988
and that's what
these fine agents did here.

32:34.023 --> 32:35.790
They found a dangerous man

32:35.825 --> 32:39.093
who was willing to commit
an unspeakable crime,

32:39.129 --> 32:41.796
and they stopped him.

32:41.831 --> 32:44.299
Ms. Bell wants you to believe
that our government did this.

32:44.334 --> 32:47.001
Ask yourself how much money,
how much time would it take

32:47.036 --> 32:51.739
to convince you to blow the head
off the Statue of Liberty?

32:54.844 --> 33:00.047
"The function of law enforcement
is the prevention of crime

33:00.083 --> 33:03.016
and the apprehension of criminals.

33:03.051 --> 33:05.852
Manifestly, that function
does not include

33:05.888 --> 33:08.622
the manufacturing of crime."

33:08.658 --> 33:10.691
Chief Justice of the United States

33:10.726 --> 33:13.360
Earl Warren wrote that 60 years ago

33:13.396 --> 33:15.896
in a case that came out
of this very courtroom,

33:15.931 --> 33:17.364
decided by a jury sitting

33:17.400 --> 33:19.800
in the same seats
you're sitting in today.

33:19.835 --> 33:22.836
That man is not a criminal,

33:22.871 --> 33:25.238
and law enforcement
prevented no crime here.

33:25.274 --> 33:27.140
They manufactured a crime.

33:27.176 --> 33:29.042
Instead of hunting actual terrorists,

33:29.077 --> 33:31.978
your government tried
to make a terrorist.

33:32.014 --> 33:35.381
They contacted him. They befriended him.

33:35.417 --> 33:37.624
They trained him.

33:38.252 --> 33:40.986
They picked a target for him.
They built a bomb for him.

33:41.022 --> 33:42.822
<i>They</i> made <i> him.</i>

33:47.195 --> 33:51.396
This is Mohammed Fayed.

33:51.432 --> 33:55.901
<i>This</i> is Mohammed Fayed.

33:55.937 --> 33:58.704
And <i> that</i> is what <i> they</i> made.

34:00.875 --> 34:04.176
It's easy to become distracted
in a case like this.

34:04.212 --> 34:07.946
To become emotional.
To focus on the wrong things.

34:07.981 --> 34:11.850
But this case is about one thing
and one thing only.

34:11.885 --> 34:14.918
It is about the power of
the United States government

34:14.955 --> 34:18.956
being used to systematically
target and manipulate

34:18.992 --> 34:21.092
and incarcerate American citizens

34:21.127 --> 34:24.795
because of their religion,
their ethnicity,

34:24.831 --> 34:28.132
their national origin, their color.

34:28.969 --> 34:31.261
It is an awesome power.

34:32.005 --> 34:35.273
But what you have today
is even more powerful.

34:35.308 --> 34:39.543
You have the power to say no.
You have the power to resist.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.945
In this courthouse, in this courtroom,

34:41.981 --> 34:43.880
in those seats today,

34:43.916 --> 34:47.318
you have the awesome power of justice...

34:48.788 --> 34:50.821
and there's nothing
more powerful than that.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.266
I understand that the parties
have reached a deal.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.267
Is that correct?

35:03.302 --> 35:04.544
Yes.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.610
No, Your Honor.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.811
Allison?

35:14.846 --> 35:17.346
I have firsthand knowledge
that the AUSA handling the case

35:17.382 --> 35:20.016
filed the additional claims
in the superseding indictment

35:20.051 --> 35:22.985
for the sole purpose of pressuring Ms.
Locarno into a deal...

35:23.021 --> 35:24.987
- The AUSA handling the case?
- ...which is an ethical violation.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.791
That's me. What are you doing?
That was a personal conversation.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.258
Oh, I thought it was business.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.894
Mr. Oliver. Is this true?

35:33.998 --> 35:34.964
I'll keep it off the record

35:34.999 --> 35:36.698
if you dismiss the case
against Ms. Locarno.

35:36.734 --> 35:37.833
I can't do that.

35:37.868 --> 35:40.136
Then I'll expedite a ruling
on the motion to dismiss.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.771
The case is going away
either way, young man.

35:59.055 --> 36:01.456
A 64-month sentence?

36:01.491 --> 36:02.573
That's five years?

36:02.609 --> 36:05.660
He's a habitual, unrepentant con man.
He's ruined lives.

36:05.695 --> 36:08.863
He's a flawed human being who's
tricked money out of businesses.

36:08.898 --> 36:11.131
Prison isn't the answer for everything.
Have some compassion.

36:11.167 --> 36:13.067
I have compassion for people
who follow the rules.

36:13.102 --> 36:16.003
Did you ever break a rule?
In your whole life?

36:16.038 --> 36:18.038
For which you didn't pay
the appropriate price?

36:18.074 --> 36:19.573
Has that ever happened?

36:19.608 --> 36:22.809
Did you ever get the benefit
of compassion and generosity

36:22.845 --> 36:24.979
for mistakes that you made?

36:25.014 --> 36:28.849
Did mercy and kindness
ever change your path?

36:31.219 --> 36:33.987
You could be a good lawyer.

36:34.022 --> 36:36.055
If you tried. You're just not trying.

36:44.966 --> 36:48.234
In the case of United States vs.
Mohammed Fayed,

36:48.269 --> 36:51.904
we the jury find the
defendant, Mohammed Fayed,

36:51.939 --> 36:55.041
guilty of one count
of attempted use of a weapon

36:55.076 --> 36:56.942
of mass destruction.

37:21.635 --> 37:23.201
Hand-Pulled Noodle House Number 3.

37:24.338 --> 37:25.937
You're not celebrating.

37:25.972 --> 37:29.707
Oh, I don't celebrate people
going to jail.

37:34.180 --> 37:37.114
You, uh... Do you mind if I sit here?

37:54.333 --> 37:56.133
I'm on probation.

37:58.671 --> 38:00.137
I'm sorry.

38:00.173 --> 38:02.073
I'm sorry...

38:02.108 --> 38:03.174
but you know what?

38:03.209 --> 38:06.643
I'm not sorry. At all.
Because I was just doing my job.

38:06.679 --> 38:08.946
- I did what I had to do.
- Right.

38:08.981 --> 38:11.014
And now I'm gonna do what I have to do.

38:11.050 --> 38:13.249
I'm leaving.

38:13.285 --> 38:14.918
You're not leaving.

38:16.321 --> 38:21.257
I. Am. Leaving.

38:21.293 --> 38:23.826
I'm leaving.

38:30.135 --> 38:32.935
I told you you were gonna lose.

38:32.971 --> 38:34.804
I told you.

38:34.839 --> 38:37.039
This isn't TV.

38:37.075 --> 38:39.441
You don't get a Muslim-American kid off

38:39.477 --> 38:41.944
charged with trying to blow up
the Statue of Liberty.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.879
You're going up against the government,

38:43.915 --> 38:47.516
the culture, the media,
everything, and everybody.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.186
The question is, what do you do now?

38:51.222 --> 38:53.856
Because now I'm Salomon Torres.

38:55.993 --> 38:58.227
May 25, 1951.

38:58.262 --> 38:59.727
A promising 20-year-old rookie

38:59.762 --> 39:02.464
starts for the then
New York Giants in center field.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.467
He goes 0-5 in his first game.

39:05.503 --> 39:08.537
0-3 in his second game.
0-4 in his third game.

39:08.572 --> 39:09.704
He can't hit.

39:09.740 --> 39:11.506
He cries in front of his manager.

39:11.541 --> 39:13.307
His manager tells him to go home

39:13.343 --> 39:15.043
and come back and play tomorrow.

39:15.078 --> 39:18.923
Next game, first inning,
he hits a home run.

39:19.716 --> 39:22.017
And then he doesn't stop.

39:22.052 --> 39:23.217
Willie Mays.

39:23.253 --> 39:25.854
The greatest baseball player of all time.

39:25.889 --> 39:28.224
I do follow baseball.

39:29.859 --> 39:31.526
Then you know, Sandra, the first game

39:31.561 --> 39:34.195
doesn't always tell you
where you're gonna end up.

39:38.201 --> 39:40.067
- What did I get?
- What?

39:40.102 --> 39:43.171
You said, on the first day,
"Get something."

39:43.206 --> 39:45.839
What did I get today?

39:45.875 --> 39:47.618
You got beat.

39:48.744 --> 39:50.443
And now you got to get up.

40:44.765 --> 40:47.266
Where's Seth?

40:47.301 --> 40:51.203
I have no boyfriend today.
And Seth has no girlfriend.

40:52.973 --> 40:54.852
Al...

40:55.943 --> 40:57.275
I'm sorry.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.180
All right. Come on.

41:02.216 --> 41:04.116
Come on. I want to show you something.

41:05.719 --> 41:08.152
You know, I've lived
in New York half my life,

41:08.187 --> 41:09.787
and I've never walked across this bridge.

41:09.822 --> 41:12.523
Well, I grew up in Sacramento
and never went

41:12.559 --> 41:14.659
to the California State Railroad Museum.

41:14.694 --> 41:17.416
So, I totally understand.

41:18.331 --> 41:19.930
I want you to stay with me, Sandra.

41:19.966 --> 41:21.065
Live with me in the apartment.

41:21.100 --> 41:23.934
I know we said it was temporary
until you found a place,

41:23.970 --> 41:25.669
but I want you to live there.

41:25.704 --> 41:26.764
And don't say you can't afford it,

41:26.799 --> 41:30.007
because it's my parents
and it's free, okay?

41:31.410 --> 41:34.044
We have to do this together.

41:35.882 --> 41:37.714
I don't want to do it any other way.

41:39.585 --> 41:42.185
Okay. Stop.

41:43.355 --> 41:45.188
Ready? Turn around.

41:46.525 --> 41:47.691
There it is.

41:47.726 --> 41:49.159
Right here.

41:49.194 --> 41:50.294
See it?

41:50.329 --> 41:51.361
The Mother Court.

41:53.198 --> 41:54.498
Are we worthy?

41:55.867 --> 41:58.067
Yes, I think so.

41:58.103 --> 41:59.302
- We are.
- We are worthy.

41:59.337 --> 42:00.970
- We're so worthy.
- Who is worthier than us?

42:01.006 --> 42:02.972
- Aaron Burr?
- Please.

42:04.609 --> 42:05.675
We are worthy.
