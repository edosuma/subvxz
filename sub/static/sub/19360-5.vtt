<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:09.199 --> 00:12.267
<i>Policing and race in America.</i>

00:12.302 --> 00:14.169
Let me see your hands!

00:14.204 --> 00:16.404
<i>Was talking to
some officers, and they said,</i>

00:16.440 --> 00:20.776
"Black people are genetically
predisposed to be criminals."

00:22.211 --> 00:25.012
It says "Missouri
Highway Patrol" on it?

00:25.048 --> 00:27.014
- It's a cop's gun?
- Yep.

00:27.050 --> 00:31.318
<i> And then, life-changing
innovation in bionic technology.</i>

00:32.455 --> 00:34.722
I'm here in Zurich, Switzerland,
for the Cybathlon,

00:34.757 --> 00:36.857
which is the first-ever
bionic Olympics.

00:32.455 --> 00:34.722
I'm here in Zurich, Switzerland,
for the Cybathlon,

00:39.895 --> 00:42.629
<i>and be the first person
to move my hand</i>

00:42.664 --> 00:44.430
<i>with my own brain.</i>

With President Obama
in the White House

01:10.057 --> 01:11.356
for the past eight years,

01:11.391 --> 01:12.790
a lot of people had hope

01:12.826 --> 01:15.426
that racial relations in America
would continue to improve.

01:15.461 --> 01:18.362
No justice! <i>Today, however,
tensions between the black community</i>

01:18.397 --> 01:21.599
<i>and police are higher than
they've been in decades,</i>

01:21.635 --> 01:23.267
<i>because over the last few years,</i>

01:23.302 --> 01:26.237
<i>a string of high-profile
killings of unarmed black men</i>

01:26.272 --> 01:28.973
<i>has led to public outcry
across the country,</i>

01:29.009 --> 01:32.042
<i>and in extreme cases
violent retaliation</i>

01:32.077 --> 01:34.945
<i>and even murder
of police officers themselves.</i>

01:34.980 --> 01:37.781
So we sent Cord Jefferson
to Washington, D.C.,

01:37.816 --> 01:42.185
to report on the chaotic state of the
civil rights movement in America.

01:46.158 --> 01:49.558
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

01:49.593 --> 01:53.129
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

01:53.164 --> 01:55.131
Black lives matter!

01:56.934 --> 01:59.969
We're hearing a ton of
"Black lives matter" chants

02:00.004 --> 02:02.237
as we walk toward
the White House.

02:02.273 --> 02:05.807
It seems like under
President Trump,

02:05.842 --> 02:08.209
that the Black Lives Matter
issue is gonna be

02:08.244 --> 02:10.578
only more important
to these people.

02:24.326 --> 02:26.259
<i>Clashing between
police and protesters</i>

02:26.295 --> 02:28.962
<i>over the issue of race
has become a common occurrence,</i>

02:28.998 --> 02:31.165
<i>one which seems to be
reaching its tipping point.</i>

02:31.200 --> 02:33.901
<i>Brittany Packnett, one of
the most prominent leaders</i>

02:33.936 --> 02:35.435
<i>of the Black Lives Matter
movement,</i>

02:35.470 --> 02:37.104
<i>explained to us
why so many people</i>

02:37.139 --> 02:38.304
<i>came out to the White House.</i>

02:38.339 --> 02:41.708
Chaos aside, what do you think
brought people out tonight?

02:41.743 --> 02:45.712
People being clear that you can't
sit on the sidelines anymore.

02:45.747 --> 02:49.415
We are not confused that this isn't the
America that we've always been in.

02:49.450 --> 02:53.152
This is confirmation for us, but for
some people, it is a wake-up call.

02:53.188 --> 02:55.486
So, this was a conversation,
very clearly, about a choice

02:55.522 --> 02:57.022
that was made
at the federal level.

02:57.057 --> 02:59.157
Lots of the protests
that happened here, though,

02:59.193 --> 03:01.793
happened because of the work
of local organizers,

03:01.829 --> 03:04.262
because of issues
of local police violence, right,

03:04.297 --> 03:07.065
local issues of poverty,
local issues of what's happening

03:07.101 --> 03:09.400
with young people
in juvenile justice.

03:11.605 --> 03:13.470
<i>The Black Lives
Matter movement itself</i>

03:13.505 --> 03:15.072
<i>gained attention
after a local shooting</i>

03:15.108 --> 03:16.640
<i>rocked the town of Ferguson,</i>

03:16.675 --> 03:18.342
<i>a suburb of St. Louis.</i>

03:18.377 --> 03:20.544
<i>The shooting of unarmed
teen Mike Brown</i>

03:20.579 --> 03:22.079
<i>was just the first
of what would become</i>

03:22.115 --> 03:23.580
<i>a series of police killings</i>

03:23.616 --> 03:26.117
<i>caught on camera and shared
on social media.</i>

03:26.152 --> 03:27.651
<i>All appeared to have
common themes</i>

03:27.686 --> 03:29.385
<i>of excessive force
on black victims</i>

03:29.420 --> 03:31.855
<i>and little accountability
for the officers involved.</i>

03:31.890 --> 03:34.023
Damn, man.

03:34.059 --> 03:35.725
No justice, no peace!

03:39.865 --> 03:40.897
Aah!

03:41.933 --> 03:43.867
He's going for a gun!

03:43.902 --> 03:45.468
No justice, no peace!

03:45.503 --> 03:48.737
I told him not to reach for it! I
told him to get his hand off it!

03:48.773 --> 03:50.205
Move back now!

03:50.241 --> 03:51.974
Shit! Fuck!

03:54.544 --> 03:56.278
<i>But while the Black
Lives Matter movement</i>

03:56.313 --> 03:57.579
<i>is most known for its protests,</i>

03:57.614 --> 04:00.082
<i>behind the scenes, Brittany
Packnett and other leaders</i>

04:00.117 --> 04:01.616
<i>of the movement
have been developing</i>

04:01.652 --> 04:03.017
<i>a comprehensive plan for action</i>

04:03.052 --> 04:04.585
<i>known as Campaign Zero.</i>

04:04.620 --> 04:06.921
What's the difference
between Campaign Zero

04:06.956 --> 04:08.823
and the Black Lives
Matter movement?

04:08.858 --> 04:11.225
So, it's a comprehensive
policy platform

04:11.261 --> 04:12.994
to end police violence
in the United States.

04:13.029 --> 04:15.562
It is a platform
that articulates

04:15.598 --> 04:17.430
what the solutions
can look like,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.733
so that we're able
to get to a place

04:19.769 --> 04:21.935
where police violence
is a thing of the past.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.437
<i>One of Campaign
Zero's biggest efforts</i>

04:24.472 --> 04:26.106
<i>is pulling statistics
on police killings</i>

04:26.141 --> 04:27.774
<i>from local news, social media,</i>

04:27.810 --> 04:29.542
<i>and national databases.</i>

04:29.577 --> 04:30.811
<i>They analyze the data</i>

04:30.846 --> 04:32.078
<i>to compare police departments</i>

04:32.114 --> 04:33.646
<i>in cities across the country.</i>

04:33.682 --> 04:35.615
What we do is
actually use the data

04:35.650 --> 04:37.850
to answer important questions
about what's going on.

04:37.885 --> 04:39.618
<i>There are some
police departments</i>

04:39.653 --> 04:40.853
<i>that are not killing anybody,</i>

04:40.888 --> 04:43.455
<i>and there are police departments
that are killing people</i>

04:43.490 --> 04:45.224
<i>at extraordinary rates.</i>

04:45.259 --> 04:46.859
<i>Depending on the month,</i>

04:46.894 --> 04:50.930
<i>St. Louis is either the number one or
number two highest police department</i>

04:50.965 --> 04:52.932
<i>in terms
of police-involved killings.</i>

04:52.967 --> 04:56.567
And almost everybody killed
by St. Louis Police Department

04:56.602 --> 04:58.669
is black.
Almost everybody.

04:58.705 --> 05:00.038
It's like about 90%.

05:00.073 --> 05:03.141
<i>Campaign Zero
calls for simple reforms,</i>

05:03.176 --> 05:04.976
<i>like increased training
on De-escalation,</i>

05:05.011 --> 05:07.045
<i>community oversight,
and the ability</i>

05:07.080 --> 05:09.280
<i>to independently
investigate and prosecute</i>

05:09.316 --> 05:11.481
<i>cases of extreme
negligence or bias.</i>

05:11.516 --> 05:14.751
<i>But to date, St. Louis has
only adopted two laws</i>

05:14.786 --> 05:16.320
<i>that apply to those
proposed policies.</i>

05:16.355 --> 05:18.121
<i>We met up with the police chief</i>

05:18.157 --> 05:19.997
<i>of the St. Louis Metropolitan
Police Department</i>

05:20.025 --> 05:22.759
<i>to find out why reforms
are so slow.</i>

05:23.896 --> 05:26.263
One of the outgrowths
of the Ferguson protests

05:26.298 --> 05:27.764
was this group called
Campaign Zero.

05:27.799 --> 05:29.866
And we looked
at some of the--

05:29.901 --> 05:32.701
it's a 10-point
policy platform--

05:32.737 --> 05:36.472
independent investigations into
police shootings, body cams.

05:36.507 --> 05:40.209
Why is it so difficult
to get these policy solutions

05:40.245 --> 05:42.745
actually utilized
by police forces?

05:42.780 --> 05:45.613
Here's the balance. That group doesn't
represent the entire community.

05:45.648 --> 05:48.984
There are people that want us to
do more aggressive-style policing.

05:49.019 --> 05:51.619
There are people
that want us to...

05:51.654 --> 05:54.489
do more stop-and-frisk,
if you will, just as an example.

05:54.524 --> 05:57.392
And it's law enforcement's job,
it's the police chief's job,

05:57.427 --> 06:00.295
to find the balance in their
community between those.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.363
We've done a lot
of the things that are there,

06:02.398 --> 06:04.664
but law enforcement
doesn't get any credit for it.

06:04.700 --> 06:10.070
At the moment, 97% of police will never
face jail time for killing someone.

06:10.106 --> 06:13.140
A lot of people say that contributes
to the erosion of trust

06:13.175 --> 06:15.209
between the community
and police officers.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.844
So, I think we have to look
at every case individually.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.114
The question is,
"Did they violate a law?"

06:21.149 --> 06:23.249
Because in that case,
what you just told me,

06:23.285 --> 06:28.121
is 97% of the officers followed
the law, only 3% didn't.

06:28.156 --> 06:30.890
I don't know, because I haven't
looked at every one of those cases.

06:30.926 --> 06:32.926
But that's really where
we have to start.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.095
<i>A common argument
against many basic reforms</i>

06:37.131 --> 06:38.997
<i>is that places
with higher crime rates call</i>

06:39.033 --> 06:40.532
<i>for a more aggressive
style of policing.</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:43.501
<i>We wanted to look at the relationship
between police and community,</i>

06:43.537 --> 06:45.637
<i>and the St. Louis Metropolitan
Police Department</i>

06:45.672 --> 06:48.373
<i>granted us access to the first
ride-along since Ferguson.</i>

06:48.409 --> 06:49.942
Roll down the window!
Show me some hands!

06:49.977 --> 06:51.543
Do you have
a driver's license on you?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.677
You're good to go.
Have a good night.

06:56.382 --> 06:59.817
Don't run over
my toe or anything.

06:59.852 --> 07:02.219
With car
stops, it's just-- you know,

07:02.255 --> 07:04.322
you can't just walk up
to a car anymore

07:04.357 --> 07:06.257
and expect to just talk
to someone and say,

07:06.292 --> 07:07.524
"Hey, this is
what you did wrong."

07:07.560 --> 07:09.293
Now, you gotta worry
about walking up to a car

07:09.329 --> 07:11.027
and somebody pulling out
a gun and shooting you.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.497
Post-Ferguson and stuff,
I wanna show people

07:14.532 --> 07:16.599
that we're not all bad.

07:17.702 --> 07:19.436
You know, kind of a goal

07:19.471 --> 07:21.972
of mine is to get
a thank you from somebody.

07:48.098 --> 07:50.398
<i> While the police could not
confirm how this gun was acquired,</i>

07:50.433 --> 07:53.834
<i>arrests like this are a common
occurrence on the streets of St. Louis.</i>

07:53.870 --> 07:57.505
<i>What was shocking, however, was how quickly
the bystanders turned on the police.</i>

08:07.849 --> 08:09.782
Has it made your job harder?

08:09.818 --> 08:14.654
The, uh, the sort of tension between the
black community of St. Louis and the police?

08:14.689 --> 08:18.157
I'm the traitor,
because I don't put down

08:18.192 --> 08:20.226
my gun and badge,
as they all say,

08:20.261 --> 08:22.028
and come join them in protest.

08:22.063 --> 08:24.730
I'm the traitor, the Uncle Tom.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.999
Um, I get that one a lot.

08:27.035 --> 08:28.634
Yup. Good to go.

08:28.669 --> 08:31.037
<i>Over the course of one
night, police made two arrests</i>

08:31.072 --> 08:32.905
<i>and seized two illegal guns,</i>

08:32.940 --> 08:35.640
<i>in what appeared to us
to be standard police work.</i>

08:36.976 --> 08:39.844
<i>But Chief Williams of the
neighboring suburb of Kinlock</i>

08:39.879 --> 08:43.481
<i>formerly spent 10 years on the St.
Louis Metropolitan Police Department,</i>

08:43.517 --> 08:47.652
<i>witnessing firsthand both the good
and the bad side of policing.</i>

08:49.189 --> 08:51.523
Can you talk a little bit
about what it's like to be,

08:51.558 --> 08:53.490
in our current climate,
a black man

08:53.526 --> 08:55.392
and a police officer?

08:55.428 --> 08:57.861
Most police officers out here

08:57.896 --> 09:00.764
are handling
their business, 24/7,

09:00.799 --> 09:02.366
with dignity and honesty.

09:02.401 --> 09:06.437
You know, one thing you have to always keep
in mind about policemen and police work

09:06.472 --> 09:11.941
is that policemen
risk their lives...

09:11.976 --> 09:13.642
to help people
they don't even know.

09:13.678 --> 09:19.215
But you have to always look at that "one
apple can spoil the bunch" philosophy, too.

09:19.250 --> 09:23.553
It was shocking. One time I
was talking to some officers,

09:23.588 --> 09:29.724
and they said, "You know, black people are
genetically predisposed to be criminals."

09:29.759 --> 09:31.526
You had officers
say that to you?

09:31.562 --> 09:33.761
To my face.
If you're telling me

09:33.797 --> 09:35.863
that people of color
or black people

09:35.899 --> 09:39.701
are genetically predisposed
to be criminals...

09:41.771 --> 09:44.338
...that pretty much
says volumes to me.

09:44.373 --> 09:46.607
And that's really gonna color
how you go out there

09:46.642 --> 09:49.610
and police that community, right,
if that's what you believe.

09:49.645 --> 09:54.582
Can't do anything but that, because
you've automatically pre-judged.

09:54.617 --> 09:58.152
I can count at least
four times in my life

09:58.187 --> 10:01.020
when the police-- before
I became a policeman--

10:01.055 --> 10:04.290
were prepared to kill me,
had weapons on me,

10:04.326 --> 10:06.092
and I was in fear of my life,

10:06.128 --> 10:08.794
only because I existed.

10:08.830 --> 10:12.499
We have to figure out
a way for those few

10:12.534 --> 10:14.767
to either change their behavior,

10:14.802 --> 10:18.170
get back onboard
as honest, just officers,

10:18.205 --> 10:20.339
or leave the profession.

10:22.042 --> 10:23.808
<i>One of the main
issues in fixing this</i>

10:23.844 --> 10:26.445
<i>is that there is no unified policing
policy, making it difficult</i>

10:26.480 --> 10:30.015
<i>for the 18,000 police
departments across the country</i>

10:30.050 --> 10:31.416
<i>to move together on reforms.</i>

10:31.452 --> 10:33.385
<i>In St. Louis,</i>

10:33.420 --> 10:37.021
<i>things are so fractured that they
actually have two separate police unions,</i>

10:37.056 --> 10:38.922
<i>one which is predominantly white</i>

10:38.958 --> 10:43.227
<i>and one which is, by its
own metrics, 99% black.</i>

10:43.263 --> 10:46.430
We are a group of officers
and civilians

10:46.466 --> 10:50.234
who are about trying to be
a voice for our community

10:50.270 --> 10:51.401
and our officers.

10:51.436 --> 10:54.304
<i>We watched
officer after officer</i>

10:54.339 --> 10:56.406
<i>share their concerns.</i>

10:56.441 --> 10:58.808
It's 2016.

10:58.843 --> 11:02.345
That's 50 years of black
officers being on these streets,

11:02.381 --> 11:05.382
in service, on patrol,
seven days a week,

11:05.417 --> 11:08.817
30 or 31 days a month,
365 days a year

11:08.852 --> 11:11.019
continuously,
to this very moment.

11:11.055 --> 11:13.255
And I can't think of--
and if you can, sir,

11:13.291 --> 11:15.357
or any other officer
in this room--

11:15.393 --> 11:18.026
can think of a black officer
that has ever shot

11:18.062 --> 11:20.996
at an unarmed white person,
please tell me.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.432
Restraint is possible.

11:24.702 --> 11:28.269
Here in St. Louis, there's
a white police association

11:28.305 --> 11:30.171
and there's
a black police association.

11:30.207 --> 11:32.907
What does that say
about how police--

11:32.942 --> 11:34.475
how the policing
is done here in St. Louis?

11:34.511 --> 11:36.877
Well, again, it says
that race impacts everything,

11:36.913 --> 11:38.513
including policing in America.

11:38.548 --> 11:40.682
We have to have a black
police officers' association

11:40.717 --> 11:44.150
because the other association is not
taking our interests seriously.

11:44.186 --> 11:45.519
It's not taking us seriously
when we say

11:45.554 --> 11:48.589
that we want policing in our
communities to be done differently.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.458
<i>This racial
division is nothing new.</i>

11:51.493 --> 11:53.293
<i>This police association
was formed</i>

11:53.329 --> 11:54.695
<i>during the Civil
Rights Movement,</i>

11:54.730 --> 11:57.764
<i>and nearly 50 years later,
it released a 112-page report</i>

11:57.799 --> 12:00.466
<i>outlining racial bias
within the department.</i>

12:00.501 --> 12:03.969
If we have to take the lead
in some areas, we will,

12:04.004 --> 12:07.005
because our department
has created a lot of issues

12:07.041 --> 12:09.375
with our leadership
or lack thereof.

12:09.410 --> 12:12.845
<i> Heather Taylor, a sergeant
for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police</i>

12:12.880 --> 12:14.980
<i>and president
of the Ethical Society,</i>

12:15.015 --> 12:16.281
<i>says they are a necessary voice</i>

12:16.316 --> 12:17.756
<i>for minorities
within the department.</i>

12:17.784 --> 12:21.453
There is a need for us
to have an association,

12:21.488 --> 12:23.788
because we haven't
been represented

12:23.823 --> 12:27.459
within the St. Louis Police
Officers Association fairly.

12:27.494 --> 12:28.793
So, of course there is

12:28.828 --> 12:31.062
a separate police officers'
association here.

12:31.097 --> 12:34.498
There's a need for it. Since
Mike Brown was shot and killed,

12:34.533 --> 12:38.835
we've had one course. So, you're
talking about eight hours

12:38.871 --> 12:41.472
- Mmm.
- Since the civil unrest

12:41.507 --> 12:43.741
of St. Louis city
and Ferguson,

12:43.776 --> 12:45.909
to address implicit bias.

12:45.944 --> 12:48.545
That's it. We are so
divided, that it's just--

12:48.581 --> 12:51.414
You know, sometimes, when I think
about our police department,

12:51.449 --> 12:52.749
I'm embarrassed.

12:52.784 --> 12:56.152
I love other officers
of all races on this department,

12:56.187 --> 12:58.388
because they're my friends.
I tell you what.

12:58.423 --> 13:01.658
When I'm pulled over, my hands
are on that steering wheel,

13:01.693 --> 13:05.227
I'm looking forward.
I turn on my light, you know.

13:05.263 --> 13:07.929
It's-- it's real.

13:09.866 --> 13:11.733
<i>If even black
police officers are fearful</i>

13:11.769 --> 13:13.234
<i>during interactions
with other police,</i>

13:13.270 --> 13:15.304
<i>it's no wonder
average black citizens</i>

13:15.339 --> 13:17.205
<i>around America are also scared.</i>

13:23.347 --> 13:25.112
But when you
get down here in the city,

13:25.147 --> 13:27.581
it's a whole other monster.
You talking about

13:27.617 --> 13:29.883
kids their age getting off
the school bus,

13:29.919 --> 13:32.553
getting pushed up against
brick walls by detectives.

13:32.588 --> 13:34.188
White people can see Sasquatch,

13:34.223 --> 13:35.823
they can see
the Abominable Snowman,

13:35.858 --> 13:37.090
they can see
the Loch Ness Monster,

13:37.126 --> 13:39.159
but these motherfuckers
can't see racism.

13:39.195 --> 13:41.161
I don't understand it.

13:41.197 --> 13:44.130
You gotta remember, a couple
of weeks after Ferguson,

13:44.165 --> 13:46.733
Kajieme Powell
got killed down the street.

13:46.768 --> 13:48.735
Come on, bro!
Drop it, bro!

13:48.770 --> 13:52.238
Oh!
They just killed this man!

13:52.273 --> 13:54.907
Come on! Oh my God.

13:59.613 --> 14:01.913
I'm scared for him.
The police look at him,

14:01.949 --> 14:04.416
and they don't see
a 10-year-old little boy.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.785
They don't know
that he on the honor roll.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.755
He a terror to them.

14:11.124 --> 14:12.758
<i>Fear, though,
is not only felt</i>

14:12.793 --> 14:14.860
<i>by the community
but by police as well.</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:17.829
<i>The recent calculated
attacks on officers</i>

14:17.864 --> 14:20.398
<i>have sent shock waves
through precincts nationwide.</i>

14:26.373 --> 14:27.872
<i>Police across
the country</i>

14:27.907 --> 14:29.073
on high alert right now,

14:29.108 --> 14:32.743
after four police officers were
shot in four separate cities.

14:32.778 --> 14:36.513
We've lost 12 officers. I don't
care what race they are.

14:36.548 --> 14:38.948
They were shot
and killed in 30 days.

14:38.984 --> 14:42.519
This officer was driving down
the road and was ambushed.

14:42.554 --> 14:44.020
<i>Shots fired! Officer down!</i>

14:44.055 --> 14:45.756
<i>Shots fired! Officer down!</i>

14:49.127 --> 14:51.560
<i>The St. Louis
Police Wives' Association</i>

14:51.596 --> 14:54.764
<i>shared their fears
about the escalating violence.</i>

14:54.799 --> 14:56.064
We call it a crisis,

14:56.100 --> 14:58.534
because law enforcement
has become

14:58.569 --> 15:01.837
disenfranchised with the
community, or disconnected,

15:01.873 --> 15:07.074
seeing protest just because
they're wearing a uniform.

15:11.615 --> 15:14.382
<i>Are you concerned
that it's gotten more unsafe?</i>

15:14.418 --> 15:17.251
<i> We know it. Just
sitting at this table here,</i>

15:17.287 --> 15:21.856
you have two women whose husbands
have almost been killed--

15:21.892 --> 15:23.124
myself and her husband.

15:23.159 --> 15:25.358
- And your husbands have been shot at?
Uh-huh.

15:25.394 --> 15:26.993
- Shot.
- Oh, shot? And they've--

15:27.029 --> 15:29.430
- They've all been shot at.
- They've all been shot at.

15:29.465 --> 15:30.864
All of your husbands
have been shot at.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.901
Mine-- mine particularly,
was ambushed.

15:33.936 --> 15:38.872
We had protesters show up in front
of the hospital, protesting...

15:38.908 --> 15:40.540
Yes, they did.

15:40.575 --> 15:43.609
...with signs that said,
"Well, how does it feel?"

15:43.644 --> 15:44.944
Yes, they did.

15:44.979 --> 15:47.613
We're also sitting at home, now,

15:47.649 --> 15:50.950
watching our communities implode.
Mm-hmm.

15:50.985 --> 15:54.754
But now, we can
at least all admit

15:54.789 --> 15:56.355
that we have a problem.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.623
That's-- that's
the first thing, okay?

15:58.659 --> 16:02.427
So, revolution, problem,
now let's seek some solutions.

16:02.463 --> 16:06.097
I, Donald John Trump,
do solemnly swear...

16:06.132 --> 16:08.099
<i>As the new administration
prepares to pull back</i>

16:08.134 --> 16:10.034
<i>federal oversight on police,</i>

16:10.070 --> 16:11.770
<i>one thing is clear...</i>

16:11.805 --> 16:14.672
<i>...policing needs to change
if lives are to be saved.</i>

16:14.707 --> 16:19.543
<i>And ultimately, reform is in the
hands of local police departments.</i>

16:19.579 --> 16:20.845
I don't know how to fix poverty.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.948
I don't know how to deal with
education systems that are failing.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.016
What I do know
is how to do police work,

16:26.051 --> 16:27.685
and when those things
don't happen,

16:27.720 --> 16:31.355
we're left with communities that have
greater demands on their law enforcement.

16:31.390 --> 16:32.789
Well, we have to solve them,

16:32.824 --> 16:35.492
or we're going to continue to do
this over and over and over again.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.328
<i>People don't understand
what we deal with.</i>

16:39.364 --> 16:42.198
You know, until you're
actually put in those shoes

16:42.233 --> 16:45.602
and you have to try to defend
yourself or someone else.

16:45.637 --> 16:49.337
We're to the point where
you have so much division.

16:49.373 --> 16:50.973
Both sides need
to get it together.

16:51.008 --> 16:53.509
<i>You'll notice
around the country</i>

16:53.544 --> 16:57.445
<i>more and more officers
are beginning to speak out.</i>

16:57.481 --> 17:00.616
We have to be the change
that needs to be.

17:04.755 --> 17:07.221
More than 36 million
American adults

17:07.256 --> 17:08.623
live with physical disabilities,

17:08.657 --> 17:11.258
<i>but rapid advancements
in bio-engineering</i>

17:11.292 --> 17:13.394
<i>and robotics have
brought about a revolution</i>

17:13.429 --> 17:17.263
<i>in bionic technology that
is realizing possibilities</i>

17:17.299 --> 17:21.101
that, up until now, would have
been considered science fiction.

17:21.137 --> 17:24.037
Wilbert Cooper has been
following this story.

17:41.989 --> 17:43.589
I'm here in Zurich, Switzerland,

17:43.624 --> 17:44.423
for the Cybathlon,

17:44.458 --> 17:46.391
which is the first-ever
bionic Olympics,

17:46.427 --> 17:49.227
to see the state-of-the-art
in assistive technology.

18:08.949 --> 18:12.383
<i>The Cybathlon is the
first competition of its kind,</i>

18:12.418 --> 18:14.585
<i>featuring teams
from around the world,</i>

18:14.620 --> 18:17.120
<i>showcasing the most
advanced technologies</i>

18:17.155 --> 18:19.022
<i>for people with disabilities.</i>

18:19.058 --> 18:20.323
Can you tell me about your hand?

18:20.358 --> 18:22.392
It has five motors,

18:22.427 --> 18:23.961
and I control those motors

18:23.996 --> 18:26.063
by electro-impulses
from my muscle.

18:26.098 --> 18:30.266
And the wicked one is... 360.

18:30.302 --> 18:31.366
That's cool.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.569
Where is it gonna go from here?
I don't know.

18:33.605 --> 18:36.438
How good's your imagination?

18:36.474 --> 18:38.908
<i>With the exoskeleton
that we brought today,</i>

18:38.943 --> 18:41.176
I can actually take
a normal walk now,

18:41.212 --> 18:43.145
and, you know,
step-by-step,

18:43.180 --> 18:44.379
there is no hesitation.

18:44.415 --> 18:45.848
It's one, two, three, four.

18:56.059 --> 18:58.760
<i>It just gives me the
ability to do the simple things</i>

18:58.795 --> 19:00.595
<i>in life that you don't
really think about.</i>

19:02.599 --> 19:04.798
For me, it--
it means freedom.

19:08.303 --> 19:10.804
<i>New developments
in scientific research</i>

19:10.840 --> 19:13.340
<i>and practical engineering
are pushing boundaries,</i>

19:13.375 --> 19:15.042
<i>making that freedom possible.</i>

19:15.077 --> 19:18.045
It's phenomenal to be in
this place and see the way

19:18.080 --> 19:20.948
that technology is transforming
and changing people's lives.

19:25.319 --> 19:27.286
<i>And some of the
most advanced developments</i>

19:27.321 --> 19:30.456
<i>are actually happening
inside the human body.</i>

19:31.726 --> 19:32.825
<i>A team from Cleveland, Ohio,</i>

19:32.861 --> 19:35.862
<i>is using an implanted device
that restores movement</i>

19:35.897 --> 19:38.097
<i>to those with severe
spinal cord injuries</i>

19:38.133 --> 19:41.033
<i>by electrically stimulating
their paralyzed muscles.</i>

19:41.068 --> 19:44.402
I have implants
in both sides of my belly

19:44.437 --> 19:48.173
to which these wires
are attached.

19:48.208 --> 19:51.442
Little box here tells
where my legs are

19:51.478 --> 19:53.845
and when to fire which muscles.

19:53.881 --> 19:58.549
So, below my arms,
without the system,

19:58.584 --> 20:01.518
the only thing I can do
is wiggle my big toe.

20:04.123 --> 20:05.890
How did you become paralyzed?

20:05.925 --> 20:08.525
It was a skiing accident
on a family trip

20:08.561 --> 20:10.527
in Lake Tahoe, California.

20:10.563 --> 20:14.964
<i>And we were on, of course,
the last run of the day,</i>

20:15.000 --> 20:19.135
I had an accident where my skis
were caught under a branch,

20:19.171 --> 20:21.470
and I flew out of the skis

20:21.506 --> 20:25.075
and hit a big granite
boulder head-first

20:25.110 --> 20:28.078
and fractured a bone in my neck.

20:28.113 --> 20:30.112
It left me paralyzed
immediately.

20:31.215 --> 20:33.448
And with the system,

20:33.483 --> 20:37.953
obviously, this is over the top.

20:37.988 --> 20:40.222
<i>Now, for the first
time since his accident,</i>

20:40.257 --> 20:42.057
<i>Mark is competing athletically.</i>

20:51.300 --> 20:54.368
<i>Pioneering this technology
is Dr. Ronald Triolo,</i>

20:54.403 --> 20:56.904
<i>a professor at Case Western
Reserve University</i>

20:56.940 --> 20:58.039
<i>and the executive director</i>

20:58.074 --> 21:00.775
<i>of the VA's Advanced
Platform Technology Center.</i>

21:00.810 --> 21:04.477
<i>We're at the verge of
an era where robotic technology</i>

21:04.512 --> 21:08.448
can make a real impact
in people's lives.

21:16.691 --> 21:19.659
<i>Our long-term goal
is to make the technology</i>

21:19.694 --> 21:21.026
as invisible as possible.

21:21.062 --> 21:25.798
<i>That means that we have some
sort of man-machine interface</i>

21:25.833 --> 21:29.235
that is completely internal
and indistinguishable.

21:29.270 --> 21:31.871
It's just stretching
what it means to be human.

21:48.889 --> 21:51.455
This technology
has helped you win this race,

21:51.491 --> 21:52.757
and do something
really incredible.

21:52.793 --> 21:55.159
What can you say
about the way technology

21:55.194 --> 21:57.761
is sort of integrating itself
into our lives right now?

21:57.797 --> 21:59.496
What do you think
that holds for the future?

21:59.531 --> 22:01.265
Getting deep
into the human body,

22:01.300 --> 22:03.834
getting technology
into the human body is

22:03.869 --> 22:05.936
one of the last frontiers,

22:05.971 --> 22:09.439
and I think that
we've tapped into it.

22:09.474 --> 22:12.775
There's some great things--
not just what you've seen today,

22:12.811 --> 22:15.812
but there's some great things
being done medically

22:15.847 --> 22:17.947
through technology as well.

22:17.982 --> 22:21.317
<i>And the technologies
on display in Zurich</i>

22:21.352 --> 22:22.484
<i>are only the beginning.</i>

22:22.520 --> 22:25.254
<i>Researchers around the world
have begun experimenting</i>

22:25.290 --> 22:29.657
<i>with implanting electronic devices
directly into the human brain.</i>

22:29.693 --> 22:32.027
<i>In Columbus, Ohio,
we met with one</i>

22:32.062 --> 22:34.129
<i>of the world's foremost
neurosurgeons,</i>

22:34.164 --> 22:36.531
<i>Dr. Ali Rezai.</i>

22:36.566 --> 22:38.800
Now, in the past
decade especially,

22:38.836 --> 22:41.336
we've learned so much
about the human brain,

22:41.371 --> 22:44.039
the human nervous system,
that's now allowing us

22:44.074 --> 22:48.042
to use technology to help patients
with nervous system disorders.

22:48.077 --> 22:52.512
So, it's a very active area
of technology that evolving.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.450
<i>Today, Dr. Rezai
is performing a procedure</i>

22:56.485 --> 22:57.852
<i>called deep brain stimulation</i>

22:57.887 --> 23:00.921
<i>on a patient suffering
from Parkinson's disease.</i>

23:13.501 --> 23:15.668
<i>Deep brain
stimulation, or DBS,</i>

23:15.703 --> 23:18.371
<i>involves a tiny stimulator
that we implant</i>

23:18.406 --> 23:21.240
<i>in a part of the brain
to shut down the tremor</i>

23:21.275 --> 23:23.775
<i>and to reduce
the excessive movements</i>

23:23.810 --> 23:25.777
<i>that are caused by Parkinson's.</i>

24:08.720 --> 24:10.720
<i>As the electrode
enters the brain,</i>

24:10.755 --> 24:13.855
<i>Dr. Rezai is able to listen
to the neural activity</i>

24:13.891 --> 24:16.792
<i>in order to locate the area
causing the tremors.</i>

24:55.730 --> 24:58.398
- The left arm.
- Good.

25:11.446 --> 25:13.846
Yeah.

25:18.552 --> 25:20.718
<i>The operation is
nearly instantaneous.</i>

25:20.753 --> 25:25.056
<i>80% improvement displays the
power of deep brain stimulation.</i>

25:25.092 --> 25:28.759
<i>The procedure can be used for conditions
from epilepsy to chronic pain,</i>

25:28.795 --> 25:31.696
<i>and scientists are exploring its
use to treat severe depression.</i>

25:31.731 --> 25:36.700
<i>In Dublin, Ohio, we saw an even
more advanced brain implant system.</i>

25:44.443 --> 25:46.610
<i>Ian Burkhart, a quadriplegic,</i>

25:46.645 --> 25:49.446
<i>is another patient
of Dr. Rezai's.</i>

25:49.482 --> 25:51.448
<i>After suffering a traumatic
injury, he was implanted</i>

25:51.484 --> 25:55.684
<i>with one of the most
cutting-edge neurotechnologies.</i>

25:57.122 --> 25:58.821
<i>Just a few
days after finishing</i>

25:58.856 --> 26:00.156
my freshman year at college,

26:00.191 --> 26:02.892
I went on vacation
with some friends

26:02.927 --> 26:05.461
and dove into a wave
in the ocean,

26:05.497 --> 26:09.132
and I didn't know where I was diving
was actually only a few feet deep.

26:10.467 --> 26:13.635
So, I initially hit
my head extremely hard

26:13.670 --> 26:15.670
and that caused me
to break my neck.

26:15.705 --> 26:19.774
I lost all function
from about my elbows down

26:19.809 --> 26:22.744
and all feeling from the
middle of my chest down.

26:22.779 --> 26:27.415
I can't move any of my individual
fingers or open and close my hand.

26:27.450 --> 26:30.384
So, after I had my accident,
I was always looking towards

26:30.420 --> 26:33.487
<i>what type of technology could
help me in my everyday life.</i>

26:33.523 --> 26:36.290
And one thing led to another,
and I decided to get...

26:36.325 --> 26:40.661
brain surgery and be the
first person to move my hand

26:40.696 --> 26:42.263
with my own brain.

26:44.132 --> 26:45.598
<i>Ian is the only human being</i>

26:45.633 --> 26:48.301
who's had this technology
applied that allows him

26:48.336 --> 26:51.071
to move his hands
using his thoughts.

26:55.243 --> 26:58.945
<i>A small port on Ian's
head opens a direct channel</i>

26:58.980 --> 27:01.480
<i>between his brain
and a computer.</i>

27:03.150 --> 27:06.385
<i>The computer interprets
Ian's brain signals,</i>

27:06.420 --> 27:09.388
<i>his thoughts, and then
links those thoughts</i>

27:09.423 --> 27:11.423
<i>to a external wearable garment,</i>

27:11.459 --> 27:14.926
<i>so, basically, the sleeve that Ian
wears that allows him to move,</i>

27:14.962 --> 27:18.829
and this is called
brain-computer interface.

27:18.864 --> 27:20.465
<i>When Ian thinks about moving,</i>

27:20.500 --> 27:22.500
<i>the computer delivers
electrical impulses</i>

27:22.535 --> 27:25.936
<i>to his high-tech sleeve,
allowing him to use his hands</i>

27:25.972 --> 27:28.806
<i>in ways that haven't been
possible since his accident.</i>

27:28.841 --> 27:31.576
All right, I'm starting
in three, two, one.

27:48.727 --> 27:51.161
<i>After four years
of not moving a flicker,</i>

27:51.196 --> 27:53.329
<i>he started moving
a little bit two years ago,</i>

27:53.364 --> 27:56.365
<i>and now he's able to perform
more sophisticated movements.</i>

27:56.400 --> 27:58.834
<i>and right now he's able
to do those movements</i>

27:58.869 --> 28:00.836
<i>much faster than he did before.</i>

28:05.176 --> 28:06.875
That's amazing.
That was awesome.

28:06.910 --> 28:08.844
That went really well.
That was your best time.

28:08.879 --> 28:12.079
That went really well.
That was good.

28:12.115 --> 28:15.283
<i> Restoring functionality
through brain-computer interfaces</i>

28:15.318 --> 28:17.352
<i>has the potential
to dramatically improve</i>

28:17.387 --> 28:19.254
<i>the lives of those
with disabilities</i>

28:19.289 --> 28:24.025
<i>and could even open up entirely
new avenues of human experience.</i>

28:24.060 --> 28:28.094
Right now, there's a convergence
of so many elements

28:28.130 --> 28:29.963
in terms
of technological innovation.

28:29.998 --> 28:33.933
<i>This is really opening up a whole
new window into possibilities,</i>

28:33.969 --> 28:36.936
<i>so you're able
to record brain activity</i>

28:36.972 --> 28:38.838
<i>and link it within milliseconds</i>

28:38.874 --> 28:40.974
to result
in purposeful movements,

28:41.009 --> 28:44.310
<i>that can be potentially a means
by which we can be able</i>

28:44.345 --> 28:47.713
<i>to detect other elements
beyond movements.</i>

28:47.748 --> 28:49.549
<i>For example, sensations.</i>

28:49.584 --> 28:51.517
Index.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.019
Pinkie.

28:54.055 --> 28:55.688
<i>Right now is a
fantastic time for us,</i>

28:55.723 --> 28:57.290
<i>because we're learning
so much more,</i>

28:57.325 --> 28:59.659
<i>more than ever before,
about the human brain.</i>

28:59.694 --> 29:01.926
One of the final frontiers.
