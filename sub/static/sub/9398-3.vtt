00:00.967 --> 00:02.958
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:03.036 --> 00:04.162
Nathan, don't!

00:04.237 --> 00:07.434
I know that you saved my life.
And I'm gonna find a way to thank you.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.737
I swam into the car and I got trapped.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.868
I didn't save anybody.
Somebody saved me.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.572
- Who?
- Keith.

00:13.646 --> 00:16.638
- What did you say?
- Keith's dead, Peyton.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.274
The boys in Tree Hill are so boring.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.945
Isn't there anybody our age
you think you could fall for?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.113
Maybe.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.679
- Hey, Ma, are you pregnant?
- Yes, I am.

00:24.758 --> 00:28.717
Deb, you need to get back into rehab
or I will dissolve our partnership.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.593
I was thinking maybe the Ravens
could use another shooting guard.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.131
I'm putting him on the team.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.860
- What made you decide?
- You did.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.925
Looks like I'm not the only one
who knows you killed me.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.335
Shut up, you little smart-ass ghost.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.203
You're definitely pregnant.

00:44.511 --> 00:45.569
I was trying to call you.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.670
You mean, when you weren't
hanging out with Peyton?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.781
As far as I am concerned,
this friendship is over.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.717
I feel like I'm hanging onto
the two of us for you.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.416
If you've been listening to my podcasts,
then you know a lot about me.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.185
But did you know I had a brother?

00:59.259 --> 01:00.453
Are you Peyton?

01:00.527 --> 01:02.256
I guess I'm your brother.

01:06.332 --> 01:11.531
<i>You ever look at a picture of yourself</i>
<i>and see a stranger in the background?</i>

01:11.604 --> 01:14.767
<i>It makes you wonder,</i>
<i>how many strangers have pictures of you?</i>

01:14.841 --> 01:19.301
Yeah, it figures the first time a cheerleader
talks to me, we're related.

01:19.379 --> 01:22.678
- I haven't actually talked yet.
- Well, you just did.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.686
So this is a lot better than the other day
when you slammed the door in my face.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.416
- After you hung up on me when I called?
- You caught me off guard.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.981
And you think I was expecting you
to show up on my front porch?

01:33.059 --> 01:35.357
According to your podcast, yes.

01:36.663 --> 01:40.724
I've known about you for a while now.
But, I didn't know if I wanted to meet you.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.430
So when you called, it freaked me out.
But I was curious.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.496
Why didn't you just call me back?

01:47.574 --> 01:49.633
I was afraid you'd hang up on me.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.571
I'm sorry. Okay, look.

01:54.314 --> 01:59.377
Let's start over. Hi, I'm Derek.
I guess I'm your brother.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.850
Hi, Derek. I'm Peyton.

02:03.923 --> 02:06.653
So, Peyton, who'd you bring?

02:07.026 --> 02:09.586
- What do you mean?
- Well, you don't strike me as a dumb girl.

02:09.662 --> 02:13.496
So, who'd you bring as backup
in case I turned out to be a psycho?

02:17.303 --> 02:20.704
Derek, Lucas. Lucas, Derek.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.241
That guy seems really cool.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.107
I mean,
you throw a skirt on him and he's you.

02:26.179 --> 02:27.510
We are not that much alike.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.640
Oh, no. No. He's a photographer.
You're an artist.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.550
You wouldn't shut the hell up
about that damn Mozella album.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.783
You both ordered the same breakfast.
I mean, I thought that was cute.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.723
We ordered scrambled eggs and toast,
same as you, same as everybody else.

02:39.792 --> 02:40.850
It was the freaking special.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.360
Okay, you know what? I quit.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.896
You have absolutely nothing
in common with your brother.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.489
I just don't know if I wanna do it anymore.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.593
Get close to somebody
so they can leave again.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.332
Look, on the contrary of what may
be written on your wall,

02:53.406 --> 02:55.374
people don't always leave.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.500
All right? I mean,
last time I checked, I'm still here.

02:57.577 --> 03:00.546
So is Nathan, Haley, Brooke.
Okay, maybe not Brooke, but...

03:00.613 --> 03:02.808
- Yeah, I think she wishes we would leave.
- Yeah.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.373
Have you heard from her?

03:05.451 --> 03:07.749
Not since she broke up with me.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.916
Well, get your game face on
and talk to her. It's playoff time.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.516
Everybody should be in a good mood.

03:16.229 --> 03:20.393
I need to be tutored.
I think I'm failing marriage.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.762
Did you try sleeping with the teacher?

03:27.307 --> 03:29.935
So, what's gotten into you?

03:30.009 --> 03:32.000
I'm just tired of thinking
about the accident.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.605
I need to get focused again
and start thinking about basketball.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.308
- All right.
- And you.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.181
You really are failing marriage, aren't you?

03:40.253 --> 03:43.017
You know I'm always thinking
about you, Hales.

03:43.089 --> 03:46.456
Thank you for being so patient with me.
I just needed some time.

03:46.526 --> 03:50.826
But after tonight,
everything's gonna be better. I promise.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.762
I'm really glad to see you so happy.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.323
But I just don't know if everything
that happened to you on the bridge

03:55.401 --> 03:57.369
is gonna go away so quickly.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.304
You know,
no matter what goes wrong in my life,

04:00.373 --> 04:04.366
every time I set foot on that
basketball court, it all goes away.

04:05.545 --> 04:06.773
You'll see.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.541
All right?

04:17.322 --> 04:20.349
- You nervous?
- No.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.759
- You lying?
- Yeah.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.227
Remember my first game as a Raven?

04:30.003 --> 04:32.733
Yeah. You played like crap.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.004
I remember walking around
for a whole week talking about,

04:36.075 --> 04:38.168
"Man, I gotta take me a Lucas."

04:38.778 --> 04:43.408
Look, the point is,
I let too much get to my head. You know?

04:43.483 --> 04:48.284
I mean, basketball is basketball
whether it's on the River Court or in here.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.521
You remember that and you'll be all right.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.719
Yeah, I'd be better
if you was out there with me though.

04:55.094 --> 04:59.690
Well, I will be, sort of.

05:04.437 --> 05:07.429
- Wait, this is your jersey.
- Not anymore.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.371
Thanks, man.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.049
- Did you wash it?
- Oh, man.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.256
Man, I'm gonna make this place look good.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.696
This jersey, too.

05:32.765 --> 05:36.064
You better. It ain't used to looking bad.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:58.091 --> 06:01.288
All right, Keith. Enough already.

06:02.395 --> 06:05.489
Do you mind? I'm paying my respects!

06:10.837 --> 06:14.466
I know I made a mistake.
But I can't take it back.

06:15.608 --> 06:19.908
And since neither of us is resting in peace,
I have a deal for you.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.144
You stop haunting me...

06:25.251 --> 06:29.085
and I'll try to make things right
with Karen, Lucas and your baby.

06:30.356 --> 06:35.760
But if you don't leave me alone,
I think you know what I'm capable of.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.999
I swear to God, if we lose tonight
I am going to kill Peyton.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.299
We will win.
Nathan's got that look in his eye.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.566
And besides, even if we did lose,
it wouldn't be Peyton's fault.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.608
Yes, it would! Everything is Peyton's fault.

06:49.675 --> 06:52.872
She's like a cursed rabbit's foot.
She's bad luck.

06:52.945 --> 06:56.574
I'm serious, Traitor Girl.
Do not take her side. Not against me.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.742
Hey, wait a minute.
Do not call me Traitor Girl. Okay?

06:58.818 --> 07:00.615
I'm not taking sides.
I didn't know there were sides.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.813
Well, there are. You're either on
Team Brooke or Team Peyton

07:02.889 --> 07:05.949
and nobody wants to be on Team Peyton
because their captain is a big whore!

07:06.025 --> 07:07.754
Okay, do you think that's a little harsh?

07:07.827 --> 07:09.556
You mean harsh like
when they shoved their tongues

07:09.629 --> 07:11.927
- down each other's throats?
- That kiss was so long ago.

07:11.998 --> 07:15.764
Again, Haley. They kissed again.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.468
- What?
- They're sneaking around again, too.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.769
You should really check out Peyton's
webcam sometime.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.136
Welcome to Team Brooke.

08:16.395 --> 08:18.955
Trade you my juice box
for your bag of chips.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.126
I'll throw in a cookie.

08:22.201 --> 08:24.669
Peyton must really need chips.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.329
Okay, how can I make this any clearer?

08:26.405 --> 08:29.101
There's nothing going on
between me and Peyton.

08:29.575 --> 08:34.511
And there's nothing going on between
us either. So why are you still here?

08:37.482 --> 08:39.474
Do I need to make that clearer?

08:39.552 --> 08:41.782
You know what, Brooke?
You broke up with me.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.755
And then you never even gave me a real
reason why. You just walked away.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.521
But I thought,
we could at least still be friends.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.495
Here you go. Thanks.

09:02.441 --> 09:05.103
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yeah, leave Deb alone.

09:05.177 --> 09:09.511
- Is she here?
- No, she quit and I'm swamped.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.047
That's Deb for you. Never finishes the job.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.153
Deb is back on drugs.
And she's carrying a gun.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.747
She didn't have any matches, did she?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.860
She needs help.
So stop whatever it is you're doing.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.486
I'm not doing anything.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.259
You're always doing something.
And it's never good.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.926
Look, you said that you wanted
to be a better person.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.265
Here's your chance. Take it.

09:32.772 --> 09:36.868
Okay, Karen. Okay, I'll stop, for you.

09:37.376 --> 09:42.313
Do it for you. And for the woman
you once claimed to love.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.714
That was the most morbid tour
I've ever been on.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.219
Yeah, well, not everybody gets
to go on the Tree Hill Death Walk.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.622
- So you should feel honored.
- Oh, I do.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.355
My favorite part was the bridge
where your friends crashed.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.397
You know, it's just too bad
I ran out of time

09:58.464 --> 10:01.922
'cause I really wanted to show you
the place where I buried my prom date.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.366
- Kidding.
- Thank God.

10:03.436 --> 10:07.031
It would be really weird
if we had another thing in common.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.906
So, I wanna ask you something.
Are you okay with me being here?

10:10.977 --> 10:13.878
You've kind of had your guard up all day.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.609
I'm sorry. That's just me.
I don't let people in, really.

10:17.683 --> 10:21.016
Hey, it's okay.
I mean, I get it. I'm the same way.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.712
Look, Peyton, I'd like to hang around
a little bit and get to know you

10:24.790 --> 10:26.655
but if you're not comfortable with it,
I understand.

10:26.726 --> 10:30.924
I will check out of my hotel
and head home.

10:31.230 --> 10:34.097
At the very least,
we had one great day together.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.995
So, you just let me know, okay?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.294
I'll see you.

10:42.875 --> 10:48.074
There's a game tonight and a party after,
if you wanna go.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.947
Yeah. Yeah. I'd... I'd like that.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.453
Crap!

11:01.160 --> 11:03.788
That pretty much sums up this season.

11:04.330 --> 11:09.393
You started out this year with
a crappy attitude. You played like crap.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.833
You took my crap.

11:10.903 --> 11:14.168
You cleaned up rat crap
from a crappy gym.

11:14.240 --> 11:19.337
Well, all that crap's over now.
At least you made it to the finals.

11:19.412 --> 11:24.850
Some of you are seniors.
This is your last chance for a state title.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.283
It's my last chance.

11:27.453 --> 11:32.083
So get out there and play like
the champions I know you can be!

11:38.130 --> 11:41.861
Ladies and gentlemen, let's make some
noise for your Tree Hill Ravens!

11:47.339 --> 11:49.671
Okay fans, you're in for a treat.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.609
Tonight, we're lucky to be joined
by Lucas Scott,

11:52.678 --> 11:54.270
former Ravens shooting guard.

11:54.346 --> 11:58.908
- Very lucky. And aroused.
- Yes. Very lucky.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.483
Before tonight's game,
Mayor Dan Scott is here

12:03.556 --> 12:06.286
to present an award
to one of our very own Ravens.

12:06.358 --> 12:11.591
<i>A week ago, my son, Nathan Scott,</i>
<i>risked his life to save two people.</i>

12:11.897 --> 12:14.695
<i>This act of bravery and selflessness</i>

12:14.767 --> 12:19.397
<i>in the face of grave danger is</i>
<i>the quality I most hoped to inspire in him.</i>

12:19.805 --> 12:22.399
<i>And I'm happy to say that I succeeded.</i>

12:24.477 --> 12:28.379
<i>On behalf of Tree Hill,</i>
<i>I'd like to present this award of valor</i>

12:28.447 --> 12:30.677
<i>to my son, Nathan Scott.</i>

12:37.723 --> 12:39.850
Thank you, hero.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.721
I'm proud of you, Son.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.464
Let's play ball.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.729
Stay the hell away from my husband!

12:50.803 --> 12:52.236
I was just giving him a proper thank you.

12:52.304 --> 12:55.137
Your "thank yous"
send people to the free clinic.

12:55.741 --> 12:56.833
What are you laughing about?

12:56.909 --> 12:58.638
Your "I love yous"
send people to their grave.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.942
Well, if that's the case,
then I love you, Brooke.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.308
Whore.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.018
Okay, here we go,
Tree Hill versus Mason Borough.

13:13.092 --> 13:16.687
The winner advances in the postseason.
And the Ravens win the tip!

13:18.197 --> 13:20.165
Nathan Scott has it out on the wing.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.133
Nathan drives past his defender
and he scores.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.703
Nathan has it out on the wing again.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.645
He puts up the shot and he scores.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.547
As some fans know, Nathan
injured his knee in that heroic rescue.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.778
But he's showing no ill effects tonight.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.981
He's playing like a man possessed.
And he drives again!

13:46.592 --> 13:48.651
Mason Borough with it now
on the offensive end.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.025
He drives to the hoop
and the basket's good.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.586
Mason Borough's keeping it close.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.793
Man, I can't believe Whitey
ain't putting me in the game, man!

13:55.868 --> 13:57.495
Man, whatever.
I've been on this team for two years

13:57.570 --> 13:59.834
and I haven't played in one game yet.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.630
Yeah, but I'm good.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.739
Scott drives to the hoop and he's fouled.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.745
He'll step to the line
for a couple of free throws.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.779
Nathan's a perfect six for six tonight.
He's got 12 points.

14:16.055 --> 14:19.456
And now 13!
Nathan has a second free throw coming.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.250
Second free throw's up.
Oh, and he misses it!

14:47.319 --> 14:49.514
That's his first miss of the night.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.807
Are you guys tired? I know I am.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.140
But then again, I'm old.

15:13.913 --> 15:18.407
And you guys are young and you've been
sleeping the entire first half!

15:19.184 --> 15:21.277
Wake up!

15:21.353 --> 15:24.948
We should be blowing these guys out,
not down by five!

15:26.258 --> 15:29.887
Scott, you haven't hit a shot since
you stepped up to the free throw line

15:29.962 --> 15:33.898
in the first quarter!
Is there something I should know?

15:33.966 --> 15:35.490
I'll be okay, Coach.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.604
- Hey.
- Hey, Big Mouth.

15:44.677 --> 15:49.671
Other than you saying it, there is
nothing that I like about that nickname.

15:49.815 --> 15:50.975
It's good to have you back.

15:51.050 --> 15:55.987
Yeah, I'm much happier in my cheer
uniform than I was in that hospital gown.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.218
Then again,
the gown was drafty in different places.

15:59.625 --> 16:04.085
I'll bet. So listen, Cooper's gone and,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.830
well, you know how I feel about you.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.358
I know.
I'm really lucky to have you, Mouth.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.031
You're a good friend.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.667
- A good friend.
- Great friend?

16:20.612 --> 16:23.080
You don't want me, Mouth.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.615
I'm a mess.

16:27.953 --> 16:30.148
I gotta get back to my broadcast.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.366
You know y'all are missing
something out there. Right?

16:42.434 --> 16:45.130
- You wanna know what it is?
- Let me guess. You?

16:45.437 --> 16:48.770
Same old story, dawg,
Whitey trying to keep a brother down.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.708
Look, somebody gotta tell the old man
they don't call me Skills

16:51.777 --> 16:54.769
'cause I'm really good
at picking splinters out of my ass.

16:54.847 --> 16:59.511
They don't call him Skills 'cause he's really
good at picking splinters out of his ass.

17:03.022 --> 17:07.721
All right. Skills, let's see what you've got.

17:09.194 --> 17:13.425
God forbid Whitey should keep you down.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.300
You're welcome.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.473
So, Skills Taylor has checked into
the game for his first time as a Raven.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.514
He's wasting no time as he drives
to the basket and scores!

17:29.581 --> 17:31.481
Yo, man, you as easy to score
on as your mom!

17:31.550 --> 17:33.450
Oh, my fault. Ain't nobody that easy.

17:33.519 --> 17:36.283
Give me the ball. I got mad D, boy.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.789
You better protect the ball.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.119
Skills with the steal!

17:40.192 --> 17:43.286
He knocks the ball away, picks it up
and he throws it ahead to Nathan Scott.

17:43.362 --> 17:46.126
Nathan racing up court,
Nathan's gonna lay it in for two.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.962
Go, Skills, go!

17:49.034 --> 17:51.332
As most of you know,
Lucas Scott was co-captain

17:51.403 --> 17:53.837
until he was sidelined for health reasons.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.704
It must be tough to go
from playing the game to watching it.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.902
Man, well, I'd be lying if I say
I didn't miss it.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.036
But I'm really happy for my friend,
Skills Taylor.

18:01.113 --> 18:04.173
<i>There's nothing like that first night</i>
<i>when you step out on the floor.</i>

18:04.249 --> 18:06.046
<i>The feeling you have.</i>

18:06.251 --> 18:08.446
<i>You don't ever want to give it back.</i>

18:11.490 --> 18:15.756
Are you in my bedroom?
'Cause I can go all damn night.

18:22.835 --> 18:26.965
Like I said, all damn night, baby!
Now drink up!

18:33.545 --> 18:34.534
Yes, sir!

18:34.713 --> 18:36.874
It's like Rachel wants people to hate her.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.850
I mean, first of all, she goes after
Lucas just to upset Brooke.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.648
And then she gets drunk
and nearly kills Cooper

18:42.721 --> 18:45.588
and now she's throwing herself at you.

18:45.824 --> 18:49.351
- Yeah, that sucks.
- "That sucks"?

18:50.629 --> 18:52.654
What's wrong? The Ravens won.
Aren't you happy?

18:52.731 --> 18:55.097
Yeah. I just think maybe
you should go easy on her.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.260
I mean, she's probably having
a tough time with the accident.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.566
- She caused the accident.
- Yeah, you're right.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.833
Let's just go inside.

19:12.551 --> 19:16.544
- A peace offering?
- We're not at war.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.789
You could have fooled me.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.688
I'm on DW, not I duty tonight.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.228
Want some company?

19:31.637 --> 19:33.935
Here comes the Brookie Monster.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.935
Welcome to my house.
Did you come to steal it?

19:38.510 --> 19:42.537
It's Rachel's house.
And I'm pretty sure you stole it from her.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.809
Are you with Peyton?

19:49.521 --> 19:52.388
Don't worry.
It'll just make her like you more.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.600
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.571
- Kissing Derek.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Peyton.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.943
I can't help who I like. New boyfriend?

20:16.014 --> 20:17.379
He's my brother.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.542
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

20:20.852 --> 20:24.982
Well, then I guess your mom slept
around even more than you do.

20:29.194 --> 20:33.995
Yo! Look, I just gotta thank the brother
who helped a brother get on the team

20:34.066 --> 20:37.160
and the brother who helped the brother
score once he got there.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.965
I lost track. Which one am I again?

20:39.037 --> 20:41.028
So, what's up, man?
How about some shots with the Scotts?

20:41.106 --> 20:43.336
Look, man, you blew up out there.
But it's only gonna get tougher.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.841
So you gotta keep bringing it, all right?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.935
Look, man,
I'm gonna be so tight out there, dawg,

20:47.012 --> 20:48.946
they're about to be calling me Ziploc.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.777
Just say you're gonna bring it, Skills.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.874
And you, we missed you out there, man.

20:52.951 --> 20:55.784
- Hey, you guys played great.
- We still missed you.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.420
All right, fellas.

20:57.723 --> 21:01.215
Look, I just gotta thank you for going
to the White Man for me, dawg.

21:01.293 --> 21:06.526
So look, just to show my appreciation,
I sent Bevin on a little spy mission for you.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.695
Okay, big news. But keep it on the BLT.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.830
Brooke broke up with Lucas.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.470
Thanks, Bevin.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.183
Yeah. Yeah.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.085
Mouth. Hey. How you doing?

21:29.154 --> 21:32.521
I wanna introduce you to Derek.
Derek, this is my great friend Mouth.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.582
I'm everybody's "great friend."

21:34.660 --> 21:37.254
Right. Look, the line to the bathroom
is longer than the line to the keg.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.354
So would you mind hanging out
with Derek for a couple minutes?

21:39.431 --> 21:43.458
- Sure. That's what friends are for. Right?
- Thank you.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.662
It's good to meet you, man.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.566
What did you say your name was? Cooper?

21:48.640 --> 21:51.404
- It's Derek.
- Whatever, Felix.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.205
You ever been a girl's friend?

21:53.278 --> 21:57.612
It sucks. You know what else sucks?
New guys.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.374
- My name's Derek.
- Right.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.851
Look, if you wanna get on my good side,

22:03.689 --> 22:05.486
and you do,

22:05.557 --> 22:07.991
stop kissing Brooke,
don't even look at Rachel,

22:08.060 --> 22:13.191
and don't move here,
because nobody likes new guys, new guy.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.760
What was I talking about?

22:16.835 --> 22:19.303
You don't like new guys.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.100
Oh, yeah.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.597
Damn new guys.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.824
I was told to stay away from you.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.360
And since when do you do
what you're told?

22:44.663 --> 22:47.598
Since never. Let me guess.

22:47.666 --> 22:51.966
You liked my last kiss so much,
you want another?

22:52.137 --> 22:53.604
Guess again.

22:54.806 --> 22:56.364
So, what then?

22:58.543 --> 23:02.274
When we were underwater,
did you see anything?

23:04.116 --> 23:07.415
The last thing I remember
is the limo going off the bridge

23:07.486 --> 23:09.681
and then waking up in the hospital.

23:09.755 --> 23:10.983
Nothing else?

23:12.224 --> 23:15.250
Just you saving my life. Why?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.789
Nathan, wait.

23:22.601 --> 23:24.626
My memory's still a little hazy.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.367
But if I do remember something,
you'll be the first to know.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.065
Thank you.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.585
Are you gonna kiss her now, too?

23:51.663 --> 23:53.392
Excuse me for a second. What?

23:53.465 --> 23:56.366
Brooke told me
that you kissed Peyton, again.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.427
Luke, that's the dumbest thing you've
done since the first time you kissed her.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.062
What the hell were you thinking?

24:01.139 --> 24:03.107
I was thinking that she was dying.

24:03.175 --> 24:07.509
She's lying in my arm, blood is pouring
out of her leg and she kissed me.

24:07.579 --> 24:11.208
And anyway,
do you really wanna go there?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.341
What does that mean?

24:12.417 --> 24:15.545
What leg were you shot in
when you kissed Chris Keller?

24:33.271 --> 24:34.329
- Brooke?
- Totally.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.374
You got a second?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.443
This kind of feels like déjà vu.

24:43.515 --> 24:44.948
Not really.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.850
You told me to fight for you and I did.

24:48.119 --> 24:50.212
But you never fought for me.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.188
And I'm not going to.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.180
Okay.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.490
I guess I was wrong.

24:57.696 --> 25:01.291
I'm not the guy for you, Brooke Davis.
She's all yours.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.112
What's up, Mouth?

25:16.181 --> 25:19.582
"What's up, Mouth? What's up, Mouth?"
That's all you ever say.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.848
- You been drinking?
- This party sucks.

25:24.923 --> 25:28.120
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.161
Because every time
you tell a girl you like her,

25:30.228 --> 25:32.753
she says what a great friend you are.
Right?

25:32.831 --> 25:34.799
Oh, wait, that's me.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.857
You're the guy
they all throw themselves at.

25:36.935 --> 25:41.304
Brooke, Rachel, Peyton,
probably even new guy.

25:43.575 --> 25:48.478
- How many of those have you had?
- Counting this one? One.

26:00.258 --> 26:04.251
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.
I shouldn't have come at you like that.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.055
- I'm sorry, too.
- I hate Rachel.

26:08.867 --> 26:12.394
You know, she's probably just...
Oh, I hate her, too.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.838
I'm really sorry about you and Brooke.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.135
Me too.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.768
She's probably going
through a lot right now.

26:20.345 --> 26:23.508
Yeah, well, she's just gonna have
to go through it alone.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.616
Hey, look,
will you promise me something?

26:26.685 --> 26:31.145
No matter what happens,
you and I will always be friends.

26:32.090 --> 26:35.526
Always and forever.

26:44.169 --> 26:48.196
I saw you come over here all by yourself.
That used to be our signal.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.262
Yeah.

26:49.341 --> 26:53.038
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm just thinking.

26:54.079 --> 26:55.569
About Keith?

26:56.147 --> 26:57.205
What about him?

26:57.282 --> 27:00.115
Lucas told me you saw him
the day of the accident.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.953
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

27:03.021 --> 27:07.321
No. I'm not embarrassed. I just...
I just don't know if I should believe it.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.552
What don't you believe?

27:08.627 --> 27:11.755
That it could happen,
or that it could happen to you?

27:12.263 --> 27:13.958
Either. Both.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.491
I used to feel that way
when my mom died.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.763
But, you know what?
I go and I visit her grave all the time

27:19.838 --> 27:23.137
and I'd really like to think
I'm not just talking to a rock.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.470
It's not crazy to think that someone

27:26.544 --> 27:29.570
you cared about and lost
might still be watching you.

27:29.648 --> 27:33.414
Well, what if he did more than just watch?
What if he actually saved me?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.180
Well, so what if he did?

27:35.520 --> 27:37.681
Do you think he saved you
so you could just sit here

27:37.756 --> 27:40.156
all by yourself and pout?

27:42.761 --> 27:46.094
If you ever wanna come with me
to the cemetery sometime,

27:46.231 --> 27:49.200
maybe the four of us can have a picnic.

27:50.935 --> 27:52.903
- All right.
- Come on.

27:57.208 --> 28:01.042
Yo, Nate, don't forget your award.

28:03.948 --> 28:06.815
It's not mine. Thanks, man.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.519
If you're looking for Nathan,
he's in my bedroom.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.998
If you're looking for a black eye,
it's in my fist.

28:24.135 --> 28:27.468
Why do you always go after guys
that you can't have?

28:28.273 --> 28:32.266
- Let me know if you see any.
- I would, except I heard he left town.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.809
I understand why you're so angry, Haley.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.211
I used to be a fat chick
with a little head, too.

28:43.488 --> 28:47.652
Hey, what's up, man. Hey, Mouth.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.922
You all right?

28:53.131 --> 28:55.929
I wish none of us ever left the River Court.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.930
We were all happy back then.

29:01.473 --> 29:05.170
Well, look, I'm gonna take off.
You need a lift?

29:06.544 --> 29:08.978
No, I think I'm gonna stay for a while.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.173
Okay.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.547
- Just call me if you need a ride.
- Hey, you too.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.969
Can I talk to you?

29:42.714 --> 29:44.705
Not if you're gonna yell at me.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.680
I wanted to ask you about basketball.

29:53.825 --> 29:57.591
Wow. If you had a cigar and scotch
in your hand, I'd think I was dreaming.

29:57.662 --> 30:00.893
- I knew this was a mistake.
- Karen. I'm sorry.

30:01.399 --> 30:03.924
What did you wanna know?

30:04.169 --> 30:07.661
Why was having basketball
in your life so important?

30:09.007 --> 30:11.601
It's the only thing
I ever knew I was good at.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.903
People counted on me
and I never let them down.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.469
It's the best feeling in the world.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.542
And when that went away,
I didn't know who I was anymore.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.746
It's scary when you lose your way.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.254
I don't know if you ever find it again.

30:27.625 --> 30:31.789
But what brings you out here in the middle
of the night, to ask about a game?

30:32.197 --> 30:34.256
Lucas is missing it.

30:34.732 --> 30:39.032
And, I just wanted to be sure
he was gonna be okay without it.

30:41.105 --> 30:43.437
I'm not the right guy to answer that.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.070
Thank you.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.947
Thank you for the crib.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.628
Okay, I know that you were drunk
at the wedding

31:05.697 --> 31:09.758
and in a coma for the honeymoon,
but just to keep you up to speed,

31:09.834 --> 31:13.463
- Nathan and Haley are still married.
- Thanks for that update.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.699
I hate those cute coupley newsletters.

31:15.773 --> 31:16.933
Rachel!

31:17.275 --> 31:19.937
Trying to steal a girl's boyfriend
is bad enough.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.809
Trying to steal a girl's husband
is unacceptable!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.371
Especially when the couple
is Nathan and Haley!

31:24.449 --> 31:25.609
They've been through enough!

31:25.683 --> 31:28.345
I'll make a note of that in my
"mind your own business" stationery.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.353
No.
Because as one of Haley's bridesmaids,

31:30.421 --> 31:32.981
making sure they stay together
is my business!

31:33.057 --> 31:34.251
So back off!

31:34.325 --> 31:37.294
She might be too classy to fight you,
but I will kick your little ass.

31:37.362 --> 31:38.727
Oh, I think you're gonna stay out of it.

31:38.796 --> 31:40.593
Really? Why is that?

31:40.665 --> 31:42.360
Because you're pregnant.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.335
So, who is the father? Lucas?

31:48.406 --> 31:50.465
You don't know Jack
unless he was one of those guys

31:50.541 --> 31:53.169
whose beanstalk you climbed
the other night.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.974
You gonna kiss your unborn baby
with that mouth?

31:56.080 --> 31:58.048
You have been begging me to find out.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.949
You haven't been drinking.
You're making maternity clothes.

32:01.019 --> 32:04.648
And, I found the pamphlets from
Planned Parenthood in your nightstand.

32:04.722 --> 32:07.486
What is that, bedtime reading?
The story of the knocked-up cheerleader?

32:07.558 --> 32:09.116
You were looking through my drawers?

32:09.193 --> 32:10.820
My house! My drawers!

32:10.895 --> 32:12.226
And I was looking for condoms.

32:12.297 --> 32:13.457
Something you probably
should've been doing.

32:13.531 --> 32:15.692
I am not having
this conversation with you!

32:15.767 --> 32:17.792
I was talking to your baby.

32:28.379 --> 32:31.212
Being an artist must be really easy.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.614
- Excuse me?
- Well, you can draw anything.

32:33.685 --> 32:38.315
But if I wanted to take a picture
of a unicorn, I'd have to find one.

32:38.389 --> 32:43.326
Oh, right, and then you'd have that
ever-so-difficult task of pushing a button.

32:43.761 --> 32:46.457
Where are you seeing a unicorn, anyway?

32:48.499 --> 32:53.562
Oh, this one's amazing.
It's so beautiful and tragic.

32:54.172 --> 32:56.902
Great. Well, you pick the one I didn't do.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.838
Ellie drew that for me.

33:04.749 --> 33:07.718
Oh. No, no, no, no. I can't.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.151
Ellie brought us together.
I want you to have it.

33:10.221 --> 33:12.917
I've seen enough
of the Angel of Death, anyway.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.515
Thank you, Peyton.

33:16.761 --> 33:19.457
I'm gonna find
a really special place for this.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.301
Well, I should go.

33:26.237 --> 33:30.230
Hey, listen,
I know you haven't asked about our father.

33:30.308 --> 33:33.641
And I haven't volunteered much,
because the truth is,

33:33.778 --> 33:35.541
I don't know anything really.

33:35.613 --> 33:39.014
I mean, other than he skipped out on me
at a pretty early age.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.117
I'm sorry.

33:42.153 --> 33:45.145
But I can tell you
what I do remember if you want.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.720
Maybe tomorrow?

33:49.827 --> 33:52.625
- Sure.
- All right.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.695
Thank you.

34:13.951 --> 34:15.350
You played a hell of a game there, son.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.081
Yeah, but it wasn't
no Lucas Scott game, though.

34:17.155 --> 34:21.148
No, it was a Skills Taylor game.
And that's exactly what the team needed.

34:22.193 --> 34:26.322
Look, man, I'm sorry about the way
everything went down with Brooke.

34:28.933 --> 34:31.060
You know what Mouth said?

34:31.135 --> 34:34.536
He said that he wished
we never left the River Court.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.264
- You think he was right?
- I think things would be a lot easier.

34:38.775 --> 34:43.440
Now, I know if we never left,
I wouldn't have lost Brooke. Twice.

34:44.581 --> 34:47.415
And Keith and Jimmy would still be alive.

34:50.554 --> 34:53.388
That's a real stupid way to think,
though, dawg.

34:53.458 --> 34:57.588
I mean, considering if you
would've never left the River Court,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.826
you would've never got with Brooke.
Twice.

35:01.399 --> 35:06.837
Your brother would still be a stranger,
and rock star Haley Scott,

35:07.338 --> 35:10.899
she'd probably be still good-old bookworm
Haley James.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.941
You can't hide from life, dawg.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.382
- Eventually, you gotta live it.
- Like you did tonight.

35:18.449 --> 35:19.882
Don't sweat it, man.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.284
Look, I got a feeling there's something
about to happen to you.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.879
Real big. Right around the corner.

35:26.257 --> 35:27.656
Check.

35:42.240 --> 35:46.438
I thought I was rid of you.
I guess you're not accepting my offer.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.471
There's only one way
to get rid of me, Danny.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.981
I think you know what it is.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.444
You keep going to that bridge.

36:22.213 --> 36:24.681
I never thought I'd be jealous of a river.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.676
You know how much I like the water.

36:31.389 --> 36:35.792
I'm really trying not to be jealous
and I want to be understanding,

36:36.494 --> 36:39.395
but it's really hard
with you sneaking around.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.260
I'm sorry.

36:43.234 --> 36:47.136
I don't want you to be sorry.
I want you to let me in.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.169
Whatever it is, you know.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.811
Even if it has something to do with Rachel.

36:56.814 --> 36:59.874
Even if you like her.
I just want you to tell me.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.885
Do you think I like Rachel?

37:03.788 --> 37:08.691
Haley, I was just talking
to her about the accident.

37:10.595 --> 37:13.723
I just wanted to know if she saw him, too.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.762
Saw who?

37:18.369 --> 37:22.897
Keith. I think he's the one
that pulled me out of that car.

37:25.176 --> 37:26.905
I'm nobody's hero.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.639
Why didn't you tell me?

37:28.713 --> 37:31.876
Because I thought it would go away.
I thought basketball would fix it.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.712
But it didn't.

37:33.784 --> 37:35.046
Nathan...

37:36.854 --> 37:39.550
Your problems are my problems.

37:40.124 --> 37:42.422
I want us to figure this out together.

37:44.729 --> 37:48.324
And you're wrong. You're my hero.

37:53.771 --> 37:58.174
- So you don't think I'm crazy?
- No, I do not think you're crazy.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.772
Do you think I'm fat?

38:04.849 --> 38:07.682
What? Of course not.

38:08.419 --> 38:10.284
Do I have a little head?

38:10.855 --> 38:14.689
No. I love your head. Come here.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.630
So that's why you keep going down
to that bridge?

38:21.799 --> 38:23.096
For that.

38:24.435 --> 38:25.697
And...

38:28.339 --> 38:29.499
for this.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.045
I love you, Haley.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.879
I love you too, Nathan Scott.

39:05.543 --> 39:10.139
<i>You ever look at a picture of yourself</i>
<i>and see a stranger in the background?</i>

39:10.748 --> 39:13.774
<i>It makes you wonder,</i>
<i>how many strangers have pictures of you?</i>

39:15.252 --> 39:19.279
<i>How many moments</i>

39:20.057 --> 39:24.858

<i>Or were we there when their dreams died?</i>

39:34.538 --> 39:36.904

39:38.275 --> 39:41.403
<i>As if we were somehow</i>

39:45.483 --> 39:48.213
<i>Or did the shot take us by surprise?</i>

40:10.040 --> 40:11.473
<i>Just think.</i>

40:12.476 --> 40:15.673
<i>You could be a big part</i>
