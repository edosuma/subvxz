01:26.106 --> 01:30.904
Arthur?

01:30.946 --> 01:33.408
where's he gone to this time?

01:35.618 --> 01:37.412
And the dog's disappeared too!

01:37.788 --> 01:39.207
Alfred!?!

01:39.916 --> 01:42.753
Oh yes, you'll see, he be a great guard dog!

01:42.794 --> 01:47.551
Alfred!
I wonder what exactly it is he'll be guarding!

01:54.228 --> 01:56.981
If you could at least answer when I call!

02:02.990 --> 02:04.282
Arthur...?

02:05.200 --> 02:05.701
Arthur?!

02:05.743 --> 02:06.577
Help! An attack!

02:06.620 --> 02:07.453
Men, come to my aid!

02:07.495 --> 02:08.121
Calm down!

02:08.205 --> 02:10.291
It's me! Granny!

02:10.374 --> 02:12.545
Sorry! I was in Africa!

02:12.628 --> 02:14.878
I can tell! Did you have a good trip?

02:14.920 --> 02:17.007
Fantastic...! I was in a tribe with Granpa!
Look!

02:17.174 --> 02:20.387
Grandpa painted a canvas
that he placed in a circle

02:20.469 --> 02:23.183
that way the animals pace round and round it

02:23.224 --> 02:24.100
but can't find us. It's like we're invisible.

02:24.226 --> 02:27.898
Invisible, but not unsmelable!
Did you have your bath this morning?

02:27.940 --> 02:29.442
I was on my way when I found this book!

02:29.483 --> 02:29.943
Hmm hmm!

02:29.984 --> 02:30.903
It's incredible!

02:30.986 --> 02:33.737
It's all the inventions Grandpa made
for the isolated tribes.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.283
Yes. He was more interested in African tribes
than he was his own!

02:36.325 --> 02:38.202
Look! He dug a super deep well

02:38.243 --> 02:40.957
and invented a whole irrigation system
out of bamboo poles.

02:40.998 --> 02:44.669
You know it wasn't Grandpa who invented
that, it was the Romans.

02:45.003 --> 02:46.841
They called them viaducts.

02:46.882 --> 02:49.551
The Romans? I never heard of that tribe!

02:49.634 --> 02:53.889
Oh, it's a very old tribe
the leader was called Caesar.

02:54.015 --> 02:55.058
Like the salad?

02:55.100 --> 02:56.810
Yes, like the salad.

02:56.935 --> 03:00.147
Put that book back where you got it
we have to go shopping!

03:04.364 --> 03:06.323
Granny, please
can I drive on the way back?

03:06.365 --> 03:07.493
I don't know, Arthur, we'll see.

03:07.534 --> 03:10.203
Oh, please, Grandpa would always

03:10.245 --> 03:12.080
Grandpa's not here, and I'm in charge

03:31.398 --> 03:32.441
Goody day, Mrs. Suchot!

03:32.816 --> 03:33.984
Oh, officer, hello!

03:34.026 --> 03:35.028
Always a pleasure to see you in town.

03:35.069 --> 03:37.115
Thank you, Officer
always a pleasure to see you too.

03:37.157 --> 03:38.241
Good day, Officer!

03:38.283 --> 03:38.950
Good day.

03:39.367 --> 03:42.080
Arthur, um, here, here's the shopping list,

03:42.122 --> 03:44.833
and I'm, I'm just gonna run across
the street for five minutes

03:44.917 --> 03:47.045
so I'll meet you at the checkout counter.

03:47.171 --> 03:48.128
Can I buy some straws?

03:48.171 --> 03:49.588
Yeah, as many as you like.

03:56.223 --> 03:57.266
Did he follow you?

03:57.559 --> 03:58.461
I don't think so

03:58.560 --> 04:00.146
Perfect! Perfect!

04:01.230 --> 04:02.691
There! It's all there.

04:02.732 --> 04:05.196
Perfect, this is wonderful thank you so much
What do I owe you?

04:05.237 --> 04:07.195
Are you crazy, nothing! Nothing at all!

04:07.237 --> 04:09.031
Now, get going before he catches you.

04:09.574 --> 04:11.411
I'm speechless, I don't know how thank you!

04:11.453 --> 04:13.245
By letting me participate!
Nothing could make me happier!

04:13.287 --> 04:14.413
Now, get going!

04:14.456 --> 04:15.415
Thanks so much.

04:15.499 --> 04:17.043
I'm counting on you to let me
know how it went?!

04:17.086 --> 04:18.921
I will, I'll call you tomorrow!

04:19.046 --> 04:19.713
Talk to you tomorrow

04:19.838 --> 04:20.505
Bye then.

04:20.630 --> 04:21.423
Bye.

04:26.054 --> 04:28.975
Oh Arthur! Arthur, no no no it's fine.

04:29.016 --> 04:30.685
You go off and play.
Go off while it's still light...!

04:30.810 --> 04:31.436
Sure?

04:31.479 --> 04:32.063
Absolutely.

04:32.105 --> 04:32.606
Thanks Granny!

04:32.647 --> 04:33.523
Sure.

04:37.988 --> 04:40.992
Yes! Yes! World champion!

04:42.201 --> 04:43.537
Alfred!

04:45.538 --> 04:48.250
Watch carefully, Alfred!

04:48.291 --> 04:51.384
You are about to witness the invention

04:51.485 --> 04:54.676
of the largest irrigation
system in the county.

04:54.718 --> 05:00.147
Bigger than Grandpa's
better than Cesar's.

05:00.248 --> 05:05.774
This
is Arthur's invention!

05:16.204 --> 05:17.416
Perfect!

05:18.667 --> 05:20.587
By the grace of God!

05:34.605 --> 05:36.282
Alfred, congratulations!

05:36.374 --> 05:38.947
It's a remarkable invention
that'll go down in history!

05:39.048 --> 05:40.322
Believe me!

05:40.363 --> 05:42.030
Arthur! Telephone!

05:42.198 --> 05:43.825
You'll have to excuse me!

05:43.866 --> 05:46.494
Probably the uh
president calling to congratulate me.

05:47.705 --> 05:49.834
Hey! I built an irrigation system
like Cesar's!

05:49.875 --> 05:50.876
Now the radishes will grow
twice as fast!

05:51.544 --> 05:54.381
Huh? Is this my honey pie?
Who is this Seesher?

05:54.632 --> 05:55.509
One of Grandpa's colleagues...

05:55.718 --> 05:58.303
but I followed Grandpa's blueprints
and it works really well!

05:58.553 --> 06:01.056
I hope you can get here before nighttime
so you can see it...

06:01.098 --> 06:01.932
where are you now?

06:01.974 --> 06:04.435
Um... well, we're still in the city, Arthur.

06:04.811 --> 06:07.565
Huh?! Oh. Well...
I guess you'll see it tomorrow morning then?

06:07.607 --> 06:10.777
Um, No
we're not going to able to make it Arthur

06:10.861 --> 06:12.615
but even though we can't be there,

06:12.656 --> 06:15.451
we wanted to
tell you that we're thinking of you

06:15.493 --> 06:17.663
Because... today is... your birthday!

06:18.289 --> 06:20.414
Happy Birthday son!

06:20.749 --> 06:23.003
Thought we'd forgot, didn't you!

06:23.754 --> 06:25.505
But ten years old is a big deal!

06:25.546 --> 06:27.383
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

06:27.424 --> 06:29.178
So how did you like the present?

06:29.220 --> 06:30.304
We haven't gotten it yet, you idiot!

06:30.346 --> 06:30.929
What?

06:31.013 --> 06:32.766
No, I fixed it with Granny.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.980
Yes, you can go into town tomorrow
and pick out whatever you like.

06:37.022 --> 06:37.982
Not too expensive!

06:38.898 --> 06:39.858
Just joking, son!

06:39.900 --> 06:43.655
But we'll see you real soon
and uh remember you have yourself a

06:43.696 --> 06:45.283
Happy birthday!

06:54.044 --> 06:55.630
It wasn't the president.

06:57.715 --> 07:00.510
Happy birthday to you!

07:00.802 --> 07:04.515
Happy birthday to you!

07:04.599 --> 07:09.232
Happy birthday dear Arthur!

07:09.274 --> 07:14.030
Happy birthday to you!

07:16.906 --> 07:19.119
You know what?
You're the best Granny in the world!

07:19.286 --> 07:21.162
And you're the best grandson!

07:22.206 --> 07:23.374
Go on, blow them out!

07:24.460 --> 07:25.670
Presents first?

07:26.213 --> 07:28.966
Oh, right. This is from Alfred.

07:34.724 --> 07:37.643
I never had a new one before!
Thank you Alfred!

07:38.185 --> 07:40.647
No, ah! If you could wait till
you're outside to throw it

07:40.682 --> 07:41.858
I'd consider that a favor

07:41.983 --> 07:43.568
Oh, yeah, you're right.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.529
And this is from me.

07:49.034 --> 07:51.037
It's beautiful!

07:58.839 --> 08:01.717
How did you manage to bake a cake?
I thought the oven was broken.

08:01.759 --> 08:04.138
Mrs. Kerman from the hardware store
actually made it!

08:04.639 --> 08:05.806
Still like it?

08:06.016 --> 08:09.687
It's fantastic. Just too big for three.

08:10.230 --> 08:13.983
Don't be too hard on them
Arthur! They try their best

08:14.401 --> 08:17.029
I spend my whole year
in boarding school in England,

08:17.946 --> 08:21.703
and when I come back for vacation
they're not even here!

08:23.288 --> 08:27.587
Anyway I'm used to it now
they're never here for my birthday.

08:30.005 --> 08:32.216
Wait! Make a wish.

08:32.508 --> 08:38.767
I wish that, for my next birthday
Grandpa will be here to share it.

08:39.601 --> 08:43.524
Better blow them out quick
you don't wanna eat a wax cake!

08:47.446 --> 08:50.865
Every night this
magnificent sunset was all ours.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.621
It's precisely into this landscape
that your mother came into the world.

08:54.830 --> 08:58.292
While I was having the baby
your grandfather was painting this.

08:59.252 --> 09:00.171
Who are they?

09:00.296 --> 09:01.798
The BOGO-MATASSALAI.

09:02.132 --> 09:04.634
Your grandfather helped build
an irrigation ditch for them

09:04.719 --> 09:08.558
and in return they gave him
a big bag of rubies.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.266
Really?

09:09.308 --> 09:12.519
Really. Oh, I could tell you stories all night long

09:12.561 --> 09:13.437
Great! Tell me.

09:13.563 --> 09:15.608
No, not tonight, Arthur, maybe tomorrow.

09:15.691 --> 09:16.234
Come on!

09:16.275 --> 09:17.277
No, I haven't even cleaned the kitchen.

09:17.444 --> 09:20.990
Please, Granny. Just a little! It's my birthday!

09:21.532 --> 09:24.955
Alright, just one minute.

09:25.038 --> 09:26.080
OK.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.960
The Bogo-Matassalai were very, very tall.

09:30.252 --> 09:33.757
They say that nature always balances itself
with its opposite

09:33.882 --> 09:35.300
and for centuries they searched for them,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.763
in order to find perfect harmony.

09:37.804 --> 09:38.806
And did they find them?

09:38.848 --> 09:42.478
Yes.
It was another tribe living right next to them

09:42.561 --> 09:47.485
and they had this particular trait:
they were small as a tooth...

09:49.861 --> 09:53.074
They called them the Minimoys!

09:54.284 --> 09:56.745
Wow! Did they get along?

09:56.788 --> 10:00.043
Oh, wonderfully! Soon they were inseparable!

10:00.709 --> 10:02.546
The one side very incredibly tall,

10:02.587 --> 10:04.841
the other incredibly small.
And only together could

10:04.883 --> 10:07.926
they have a complete vision of the world.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.053
Who's this?

10:09.470 --> 10:13.601
This is the Princess Selenia.
Daughter of the king of the Minimoys.

10:14.394 --> 10:17.440
She's beautiful! I mean, this is incredible!

10:17.475 --> 10:20.487
Yes and the king himself
gave your grandfather

10:20.571 --> 10:21.362
the secret of
how to find him anytime he wanted!

10:21.404 --> 10:24.201
That's what your grandfather said;

10:24.242 --> 10:28.579
every time he was a little drunk.

10:28.830 --> 10:30.748
I'd like to meet the Minimoys too.

10:32.711 --> 10:34.464
Now, to sleep!

10:36.674 --> 10:38.720
Sweet dreams.

10:57.077 --> 11:01.041
We miss you Archibald. We really do.

11:29.245 --> 11:30.414
No!

11:36.505 --> 11:38.549
How you doing, kid?

11:50.899 --> 11:52.734
Nice shot.

12:12.928 --> 12:15.475
Oh! Mr. Davido! You startled me!

12:15.516 --> 12:16.891
I'm so sorry!'

12:16.933 --> 12:18.895
Spring cleaning? Need a hand?

12:18.935 --> 12:20.813
No, thank you. What do you want this time?

12:20.855 --> 12:23.692
Here it is! Done! Signed
sealed and delivered.

12:23.734 --> 12:24.777
You didn't waste any time!

12:24.819 --> 12:26.738
That was a coincidence really.
I was in church, this morning

12:26.780 --> 12:28.740
You were in church?
I've never seen you there.

12:28.823 --> 12:31.454
Oh, I usually sit in the back. Modesty really.

12:31.496 --> 12:32.372
You really should have been there.

12:32.413 --> 12:33.287
You would have seen the Mayor,

12:33.329 --> 12:34.373
who confirmed the document

12:34.414 --> 12:35.751
which pronounces the expiration
of your ownership

12:35.792 --> 12:38.503
of this property for lack of payment.
The president of the bank,

12:38.919 --> 12:42.509
who transferred your debt to me.
And as amazing as it may seem,

12:42.550 --> 12:43.844
you know who else was there?

12:43.886 --> 12:46.347
The Notary and the Chief of Police

12:46.390 --> 12:48.100
who countersigned the order of eviction.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.728
So you see
there is not a single signature missing,

12:50.811 --> 12:53.817
and if your husband does not sign this paper
within the next 48 hours,

12:54.151 --> 12:56.403
I will be under the obligation to evict you
from this property

12:56.444 --> 12:59.448
whether your laundry is dry or not!

12:59.866 --> 13:03.369
Ah! You should to hang him up to dry as well!

13:04.121 --> 13:06.166
Are we gonna have to leave the house?

13:06.207 --> 13:07.584
I'm afraid so

13:08.209 --> 13:10.798
I won't be able to hold off
that vulture Davido much longer

13:10.839 --> 13:12.090
but what about the treasure?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.303
The rubies that the Matassalais gave Grandpa?

13:14.845 --> 13:17.179
Your grandpa hid them somewhere out
there in the yard.

13:17.220 --> 13:18.514
I dug for weeks!

13:18.556 --> 13:21.520
And I... he hid them so well I haven't been
able to find them.

13:24.230 --> 13:25.107
Where are you going?

13:25.232 --> 13:27.111
You think I'm gonna hang around

13:27.153 --> 13:28.279
twiddling my thumbs for forty eight hours?

13:28.321 --> 13:29.488
I'm gonna find the treasure!

13:32.242 --> 13:34.703
Just like his Grandpa!

13:47.136 --> 13:50.516
You should go and find my car rather
than sitting there watching me.

13:58.484 --> 13:59.862
Can I help you?

14:01.365 --> 14:02.491
Oh! Pardon me!

14:03.033 --> 14:05.912
You came by our house once and left this.

14:06.162 --> 14:09.585
You said if we ever wanted to get rid
of any furniture or knick knacks

14:09.626 --> 14:10.335
Yes?

14:10.377 --> 14:14.882
Well, I, I brought this...
it's from my private collection

14:14.923 --> 14:17.427
I wondered if it was at all valuable.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.810
Ah! What is this? A carnival mask?

14:22.935 --> 14:25.647
No, this is an African mask.

14:25.688 --> 14:28.234
This is... this belonged to the chief
of the Bogo-Matassalai tribe.

14:28.359 --> 14:28.860
Two bucks.

14:28.902 --> 14:33.447
Two dollars?
But this is... of inestimable value

14:33.489 --> 14:34.324
Alright alright, two fifty.

14:34.408 --> 14:35.367
That's the best I can do!

14:35.409 --> 14:37.996
This kind of exotic object
just isn't selling any more.

14:38.204 --> 14:42.628
People want practical
concrete, modern stuff, you know.

14:44.923 --> 14:47.552
I can't believe you'd have hidden the treasure
in the yard

14:47.593 --> 14:50.139
without leaving some sort of clue,

14:50.181 --> 14:51.681
a note, something to help us find it!

14:56.688 --> 14:59.316
Malthazar... the Evil... M

15:05.159 --> 15:06.743
I hope
I have the honor of meeting you one day,

15:06.785 --> 15:07.662
Princess! In the meantime

15:08.788 --> 15:13.126
Permit me to steal a kiss.

15:16.255 --> 15:17.550
Jealous!

15:22.098 --> 15:24.016
I knew it!

15:24.058 --> 15:28.646
to get to the land of the Minimoys
put your trust in Shakespeare.

15:38.119 --> 15:40.248
The house is here... south is that way.

15:41.664 --> 15:44.210
The tree! The elf! The moon!

15:44.253 --> 15:44.669
It's all there!

15:44.711 --> 15:46.422
Alfred! We found it! Yes!

15:46.464 --> 15:47.713
Ah!

15:47.796 --> 15:48.965
Hang on there, young man!

15:49.007 --> 15:50.801
Arthur, how many times do
I have to tell you?

15:50.885 --> 15:52.012
I don't want you playing in this room.

15:52.679 --> 15:54.140
Excuse me, please, go ahead!

15:54.181 --> 15:54.807
Thank you

15:54.890 --> 15:55.349
Granny?!

15:55.391 --> 15:55.850
What?

15:55.892 --> 15:56.852
Who are these guys?

15:56.977 --> 15:59.773
This gentleman is going to evaluate some of
your grandpa's things.

15:59.808 --> 16:00.440
Granny?!

16:00.482 --> 16:00.733
What?

16:00.858 --> 16:02.109
You're not gonna sell grandpa's things?!

16:02.151 --> 16:04.153
I'm afraid I don't have any choice anymore!

16:04.194 --> 16:06.864
Yes we do! Look!
It's the map to get to the Minimoys!

16:06.906 --> 16:07.449
What map?

16:07.491 --> 16:07.950
They're here!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.160
Grandpa brought them back
from Africa with him!

16:10.201 --> 16:11.036
If we can get to them,

16:11.203 --> 16:12.497
I'm sure they can lead us to the treasure!

16:12.539 --> 16:14.542
Arthur you're a big boy now, right?

16:14.583 --> 16:15.584
You don't really believe

16:15.626 --> 16:17.045
there are little elves running around the garden

16:17.086 --> 16:18.506
just waiting for you to visit

16:18.548 --> 16:20.175
so they can slap a bag of rubies in your hand!

16:20.216 --> 16:20.842
Pardon me?

16:21.510 --> 16:24.765
No, nothing...
I... I was chatting with my grandson.

16:24.807 --> 16:26.765
If you have jewels, we are interested

16:26.807 --> 16:28.936
Unfortunately, not a jewel on the horizon.

16:29.103 --> 16:30.020
Go to your room, now

16:32.064 --> 16:35.529
'some words may hide others'
William. 'S' for Socrates?

16:35.988 --> 16:38.407
Shakespeare. William Shakespeare.

16:38.449 --> 16:39.952
Ah! Not too far off!

16:39.993 --> 16:43.870
Yes. Better hurry and make your choice
before I change my mind.

16:44.997 --> 16:45.708
Come on let's go.

16:45.916 --> 16:46.334
Granny

16:46.417 --> 16:46.876
Let's go

16:46.918 --> 16:47.670
Three hundred dollars.

16:48.379 --> 16:51.048
It's not very much for thirty years of memories!

16:51.090 --> 16:53.302
A down payment! If sell them well
you'll have more

16:53.428 --> 16:54.720
thank you.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.181
Mrs. Suchot?

16:56.724 --> 16:57.600
Yes.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.685
Frederic De Saint-Clair.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.394
Process server, Bailiff.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.814
It seems I came at an opportune time.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.275
I have a claim for
debt collection which concerns you,

17:05.400 --> 17:07.612
for non-payment of services rendered
by a certain Mr. Davido,

17:07.737 --> 17:09.406
Ernest, for the amount of
two hundred fifty two dollars,

17:09.907 --> 17:11.742
now with the
six percent late penalty surcharge,

17:11.825 --> 17:12.702
and procedural fees added,

17:12.743 --> 17:15.583
that comes to a total
of two hundred ninety five dollars and five cents.

17:15.625 --> 17:18.836
May I?

17:24.593 --> 17:26.220
Here's your change.

17:26.888 --> 17:27.263
Hello?

17:27.305 --> 17:29.349
Sweetie it's mom, is everything alright?

17:29.433 --> 17:29.850
Great!

17:29.934 --> 17:31.812
We're cleaning up today!

17:31.896 --> 17:34.022
It's amazing how much old stuff
just piles up around the place...

17:34.064 --> 17:35.859
but, thanks to Granny, we threw it all out!

17:35.942 --> 17:38.197
Arthur! Don't upset your parents!

17:38.489 --> 17:39.906
Did you hang up on your mother?

17:39.947 --> 17:41.657
Of course not! It hung up by itself!

17:41.740 --> 17:43.201
Well, she'll call back in a second!

17:43.243 --> 17:45.246
Granny! They've cut the phone line!

17:45.288 --> 17:46.830
Don't you see what's happening?

17:46.872 --> 17:48.751
We've fallen into their trap,

17:48.834 --> 17:50.837
and it's closing in on us a little bit
more every minute!

17:51.421 --> 17:53.007
But as long as I live and breathe,

17:53.049 --> 17:54.718
they're not gonna get this house!

17:55.510 --> 17:57.847
There you see? That's probably the repairman.

17:59.392 --> 18:00.182
Good evening ma'am!

18:00.223 --> 18:01.183
You came at just the right time!

18:01.224 --> 18:03.144
Our phone's just been cut off

18:03.186 --> 18:04.855
and I really think you should warn people!

18:04.939 --> 18:05.440
I agree, ma'am,

18:05.566 --> 18:06.900
but I'm not from the phone company,

18:06.942 --> 18:08.735
I'm from the electric company.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.197
And I came to tell you

18:10.322 --> 18:11.907
that you're gonna be cut off soon
for nonpayment.

18:16.998 --> 18:19.041
Some words may hide others

18:19.083 --> 18:21.919
Grandpa help me

18:21.961 --> 18:23.463
When am I gonna get cut off?

18:25.091 --> 18:26.760
That's what I call a clear answer...

18:27.094 --> 18:28.971
Don't move, I'll get a candle.

18:35.439 --> 18:41.154
Some words may hide others...! Of course!

18:41.196 --> 18:46.035
My dear Arthur. I was sure
I could count on you to find my riddle.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.164
You must be at least ten to have
become so clever.

18:49.206 --> 18:51.209
I, on the other hand, have not been so clever,

18:51.251 --> 18:55.216
and if you are reading this
I am probably dead.

18:55.258 --> 18:59.136
Therefore, the heavy task of accomplishing
my mission now falls to you.

18:59.177 --> 19:00.471
If you accept it, that is.

19:00.554 --> 19:02.098
I accept, Grandpa.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.644
I knew you would. Bravo.
To get to the land of the Minimoys,

19:04.685 --> 19:09.776
you must know on which day
the next passage will fall.

19:09.859 --> 19:11.820
There's only one per year.

19:11.904 --> 19:16.450
Take the universal calendar from my desk.
The night of the tenth moon,

19:16.492 --> 19:17.911
at precisely midnight
the moonlight-passage will open

19:17.952 --> 19:20.518
If you follow my instructions,

19:20.553 --> 19:23.085
on the twentieth knock, you

19:23.127 --> 19:26.089
will have the world in your hands

19:26.131 --> 19:31.889
That's today!

19:32.766 --> 19:35.726
Night brings good counsel
Arthur. We'll sleep on it

19:35.768 --> 19:38.229
Tomorrow will bring a solution.

19:38.271 --> 19:39.565
Good night, Granny.

19:39.606 --> 19:40.692
Goodnight.

19:44.489 --> 19:48.578
The world in my hands... world in my hands.

19:49.121 --> 19:51.665
On the right side of the chimney,

19:51.708 --> 19:53.249
there's a button
Turn it all the way to the right,

19:53.291 --> 19:55.420
and then turn it back to the left.

19:55.838 --> 20:01.011
Only twenty minutes before midnight.
I've got to do something.

20:11.984 --> 20:12.942
Damn!

20:46.866 --> 20:49.701
Ah! I thought you were in the shower!

20:49.743 --> 20:51.912
No, I was in the living room looking
for my sleeping drops...

20:51.947 --> 20:54.038
And if you don't get back into bed this second

20:54.080 --> 20:56.669
I'm gonna make you drink the whole bottle!

20:56.710 --> 20:57.837
Go!

20:59.798 --> 21:01.800
Go on! Go on!

21:10.727 --> 21:12.773
You know, I don't like to do this.

21:12.815 --> 21:14.484
But I'm gonna lock you in.

21:14.568 --> 21:15.776
I don't want you to do anything stupid tonight.

21:15.859 --> 21:16.234
OK.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.323
OK

22:09.641 --> 22:16.317
Alfred, what're you doing?
Go to sleep. Is it the full moon or what?

22:17.360 --> 22:20.030
Thank you, Alfred

22:27.039 --> 22:28.373
Aaaah!

22:37.554 --> 22:39.556
Granny!?

22:56.871 --> 22:58.958
Always keeps this key with you

23:03.712 --> 23:06.633
The garden, the tree, the telescope

23:06.675 --> 23:08.427
Oh my god!

23:14.268 --> 23:15.729
I need more light!

23:20.819 --> 23:22.528
I've seen Granny do this
a hundred times.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, yeah, the brake...

23:36.500 --> 23:46.500
Ah! Oh! No! No!
No!

23:50.442 --> 23:52.361
Perfect!

23:56.450 --> 23:57.827
Sorry, old man!

24:23.359 --> 24:25.362
Now for the dolls.

24:46.141 --> 24:48.353
Ah! Alfred!

24:58.322 --> 24:59.575
Arthur?

24:59.993 --> 25:02.163
Uh, yeah.

25:02.205 --> 25:04.081
Follow me!

25:04.165 --> 25:05.583
Oh, okay

25:13.012 --> 25:14.639
Hi.

25:43.885 --> 25:45.555
Time to go.

25:45.596 --> 25:47.307
You're not coming?

25:47.933 --> 25:49.810
Only one can pass through,

25:49.893 --> 25:53.063
and you seem to us to be the best
choice to combat Evil M

25:53.105 --> 25:53.938
MALTHAZAR?

25:54.063 --> 25:55.441
Oh!

25:55.607 --> 25:57.570
Never, never speak that name.

25:57.611 --> 25:58.488
It brings bad luck.

25:58.613 --> 25:59.738
OK, OK...

26:00.072 --> 26:02.242
Your grandfather went off to defeat him,

26:02.284 --> 26:04.706
and now it's up to you to continue his fight

26:05.330 --> 26:06.332
Thanks for the honor,

26:06.583 --> 26:08.961
but... I think it might be better
if I leave my place to one of you

26:09.503 --> 26:11.545
I mean, you're so much bigger
and stronger than me...!

26:11.628 --> 26:13.424
Your heart is the strongest of weapons.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.009
OK.

26:17.178 --> 26:23.980
The first ring, for the body
three times to the right

26:24.982 --> 26:31.281
The second ring, for the mind
three times to... the left.

26:31.656 --> 26:42.631
And the third ring... one whole turn for the soul

26:43.633 --> 26:45.049
Ah!

26:47.554 --> 26:49.056
There! The door is open!

26:49.098 --> 26:50.639
You can introduce yourself!

26:50.680 --> 26:51.682
Introduce myself?

26:51.724 --> 26:54.229
Yes, and try to be convincing
because you only have five minutes.

26:54.312 --> 26:58.484
Alright! Be convincing! OK! OK!

27:07.830 --> 27:11.959
Euh... There's a... with

27:16.092 --> 27:17.135
Archibald?

27:17.634 --> 27:18.219
No, no... No.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.347
Introduce yourself!

27:21.433 --> 27:24.852
I... I'm his grandson... My name is Arthur...
and you are

27:24.895 --> 27:26.856
Saimono Matrodoy de Betameche

27:26.898 --> 27:27.773
Right...

27:27.815 --> 27:29.067
But you can call me Beta...

27:29.150 --> 27:31.152
Pleased to meet you, Beta

27:31.194 --> 27:32.905
I hope you have a good reason
for using the beam like that,

27:32.947 --> 27:34.991
because the Council has strictly forbidden it

27:35.026 --> 27:36.577
Go on! Go on!

27:36.618 --> 27:39.247
This is a matter of extreme urgency!

27:39.539 --> 27:41.542
In just two days' time
the garden will be destroyed

27:41.584 --> 27:43.003
What are you talking about, young man?

27:43.045 --> 27:44.338
Are you a practical joker
like your grandfather?

27:44.421 --> 27:46.172
This is no joke, Mister Betameche...

27:46.214 --> 27:48.718
A building contractor wants to flatten the land

27:48.759 --> 27:49.636
and build apartment blocks!

27:49.803 --> 27:51.554
Ah...! What are apartment blocks?

27:51.596 --> 27:53.891
Enormous houses built from concrete that

27:54.141 --> 27:57.772
will cover up all the gardens
and stop the flowers from growing!

27:57.814 --> 27:58.772
Ah! But what's awful!

27:58.982 --> 28:01.319
The only way to prevent this is for me
to find the treasure

28:01.361 --> 28:03.030
that my grandfather has hidden somewhere!

28:03.405 --> 28:03.823
Then

28:03.865 --> 28:06.825
I'll be able to pay off the contractor
and none of this will happen!

28:06.867 --> 28:09.912
Well, that's a really good idea!
All's well that ends well!

28:09.954 --> 28:11.081
See ya!

28:11.332 --> 28:13.542
No, no! To do that...
I need to pass into your world

28:13.626 --> 28:15.379
so I can start looking for the treasure!

28:15.670 --> 28:17.967
That's not possible!
You can't make a journey just like that

28:18.050 --> 28:19.217
The council must first be assembled...

28:19.300 --> 28:20.720
then you must explain your problem to them,

28:20.762 --> 28:21.804
they will then deliberate and

28:21.846 --> 28:24.932
And in two days' time the land will be
flattened and you'll all be dead!

28:25.642 --> 28:26.976
This is an extreme emergency.

28:27.059 --> 28:28.646
Yes, and we have to act now

28:28.897 --> 28:31.025
because the future of your people
is in your hands!

28:31.150 --> 28:34.154
Yes, you're right in my hands.
This calls for action!

28:35.155 --> 28:37.450
Ferryman! Ferryman! Wake-up
it's an emergency!

28:37.576 --> 28:38.786
You did well!

28:38.827 --> 28:40.663
I hope it will be enough to convince him!

28:43.874 --> 28:45.627
Betameche? You little good-for-nothing!

28:45.669 --> 28:47.086
Don't you have anything better to do

28:47.170 --> 28:48.924
than go around waking up honest people?

28:48.965 --> 28:50.884
My father sent me. It's for a trip!

28:50.926 --> 28:52.011
What again!?

28:52.136 --> 28:53.471
Why does everyone want to suddenly travel?!

28:53.513 --> 28:54.723
The last one was three years ago...

28:54.765 --> 28:57.476
Exactly, that's what I mean
I was just starting to nod off

28:57.518 --> 28:58.688
Hurry up, the King is losing patience!

28:58.729 --> 28:59.272
The King! The King!

28:59.605 --> 29:02.023
First, the moon...! Is it full now?

29:02.231 --> 29:03.107
Perfect, perfect!

29:03.149 --> 29:04.735
Now for the rings

29:05.153 --> 29:08.990
So... three turns to the right for the body

29:10.535 --> 29:13.791
three turns to the left for the spirit.

29:14.166 --> 29:17.296
and now, one whole turn for the soul.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.137
What's happening to me?!

29:25.179 --> 29:28.059
You are going to join our brothers
the Minimoys!

29:28.102 --> 29:29.393
They will lead you to

29:29.477 --> 29:30.354
Help! the Seven Kingdoms.

29:30.687 --> 29:31.355
Stop!

29:31.689 --> 29:33.108
You only have thirty-six hours!

29:33.317 --> 29:33.860
Granny!

29:34.026 --> 29:34.902
At noon on the day after tomorrow,

29:34.944 --> 29:38.073
the gateway will close again for 1000 days!

29:38.365 --> 29:41.243
Thirty six hours... I'll do my best!

29:41.284 --> 29:42.535
Aaaaaaaah!

29:42.577 --> 29:44.497
Good luck, Arthur.

29:44.538 --> 29:47.252
Aaaaaaaah!

29:56.348 --> 29:57.849
The key! You have the key!

29:58.350 --> 29:59.182
The key?

30:00.101 --> 30:00.977
Yeah I have the key!

30:03.773 --> 30:05.608
OK. Now go over to the lock.

30:05.650 --> 30:09.072
The lock...? That has to be it.

30:09.114 --> 30:11.910
Good! Good! Now turn the key.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.292
I'm gonna die!

30:17.456 --> 30:19.252
Yes!

30:19.294 --> 30:30.226
No, no, no, no, no! Aaaaah!

30:32.895 --> 30:34.691
Welcome to the Land of the Minimoys!

30:34.899 --> 30:36.943
It's not funny! You really scared me!

30:37.026 --> 30:38.150
I thought I was going to die in that

30:41.574 --> 30:42.326
That's incredible!

30:42.534 --> 30:43.701
What's incredible?

30:43.868 --> 30:46.205
I dunno, just look at my clothes
they've changed!

30:46.246 --> 30:47.541
You can admire yourself later.

30:47.624 --> 30:50.086
The council's waiting for you...
Come on, follow me!

30:52.505 --> 30:55.175
I think I'd like to take a little nap

31:08.318 --> 31:09.278
How far've they got?!

31:09.487 --> 31:12.031
You're joking, they've only just started.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.600
Princess Selenia!

31:38.733 --> 31:39.901
My little girl

31:39.984 --> 31:41.278
Father!

31:41.361 --> 31:46.912
Sorry. Princess Selenia
may the spirits of the Ancients guide you.

31:50.207 --> 31:50.833
Papa!

31:51.208 --> 31:52.834
Yes?

31:52.876 --> 31:53.503
Papa!

31:53.545 --> 31:54.212
Where are you?

31:54.296 --> 31:55.379
I'm over here!

31:55.630 --> 31:56.464
My son!

31:56.506 --> 31:58.050
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

31:58.176 --> 32:00.054
Couldn't you have waited ten seconds
before playing the clown?

32:00.095 --> 32:01.764
I'm on a mission of great importance!

32:01.806 --> 32:04.184
Aah? Because my mission isn't of great
importance is that it?

32:04.225 --> 32:05.728
You're far too arrogant to
be able to free the sword!

32:05.770 --> 32:06.229
You know you are!

32:06.264 --> 32:06.604
Uh!

32:06.646 --> 32:08.648
Enough! Stop bickering, the two of you!

32:08.941 --> 32:09.900
Betameche!

32:09.942 --> 32:11.276
I hope

32:11.318 --> 32:12.570
you have good reason for daring to
disrupt this important ceremony.

32:12.611 --> 32:16.074
I do father! The Upperlands Light Beam
was activated today.

32:16.951 --> 32:18.453
Who would dare do this?

32:18.536 --> 32:19.371
His name is Arthur.

32:19.537 --> 32:20.747
He is the grandson of Archibald,

32:20.832 --> 32:23.126
and he says a great misfortune is
about to befall us

32:23.209 --> 32:25.212
Our great misfortune has a name:

32:25.247 --> 32:26.172
The Evil M.

32:26.214 --> 32:27.675
And we have no need of this Arthur person.

32:27.717 --> 32:30.008
As the Princess of royal blood,

32:30.050 --> 32:32.888
the task of protecting our People falls to me.
Hmm!

32:46.449 --> 32:50.995
It's moving! I have it, I have it! I feel it!

32:57.046 --> 32:57.755
Hah!

32:57.796 --> 33:00.467
See, told you so. Way too arrogant.

33:01.177 --> 33:02.470
In view of the circumstances,

33:02.512 --> 33:04.431
the Council agrees to hear this young man.

33:18.116 --> 33:18.991
Cute huh?

33:19.075 --> 33:20.662
Ordinary

33:22.414 --> 33:24.167
My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

33:24.209 --> 33:25.668
Who told him my name?

33:25.709 --> 33:27.252
My humble respects,
Princess Selenia.

33:27.295 --> 33:29.172
I'm sure it was you
you're only one that knows this Arthur

33:29.207 --> 33:30.507
You can't keep a secret

33:30.549 --> 33:32.342
My humble respects, your Majesty.

33:32.384 --> 33:35.639
Um... yes... my respects

33:35.681 --> 33:38.394
Oh Arthur, I am delighted to meet you...

33:38.436 --> 33:40.479
I was a good friend
of your grandfather Archibald!

33:40.814 --> 33:42.148
Well, young man... we've all ears!

33:43.568 --> 33:44.277
It's like this...

33:44.320 --> 33:45.320
In just under two days some men
are going to come

33:45.362 --> 33:47.361
and destroy my house, my garden,

33:47.612 --> 33:48.823
my world. And your world.

33:48.990 --> 33:51.035
And you, all two
and a half millimeters of you,

33:51.160 --> 33:52.209
you've come to save us, is that it?

33:52.244 --> 33:53.996
The only way to stop these men
is to pay them off!

33:54.164 --> 33:56.124
This is why my grandfather
came to you three years ago.

33:56.584 --> 33:59.798
He was looking for a treasure and...
I've come to complete his mission.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.842
Your grandfather was a remarkable man

34:01.883 --> 34:03.970
He taught us so many things!

34:04.011 --> 34:06.764
He was the one who showed Miro
how to harness image and light.

34:07.264 --> 34:08.850
Then one day he left,

34:08.889 --> 34:10.686
in search of this famous treasure.

34:10.728 --> 34:13.357
And after wandering through the seven lands
which make up our world,

34:13.398 --> 34:16.277
he finally found it

34:16.319 --> 34:19.156
Deep in the Forbidden Lands
in the heart of the city of Necropolis,

34:19.197 --> 34:23.536
where he reigns supreme...
the Evil M. And unfortunately,

34:23.578 --> 34:27.081
no one every returns from the Forbidden Lands

34:27.500 --> 34:28.583
So

34:31.170 --> 34:32.799
Look out! To the central gate!

34:39.433 --> 34:41.478
It's Gondolo, the Juggler of the Great River

34:41.520 --> 34:45.232
That's incredible we thought
he was lost forever in the Forbidden Lands

34:46.192 --> 34:47.067
Stop!

34:48.110 --> 34:49.362
What's wrong, Arthur?

34:49.404 --> 34:50.280
Sire, look over there,

34:50.489 --> 34:52.242
it looks as if a piece is peeling off.

34:52.284 --> 34:53.243
I think it's a trap.

34:53.493 --> 34:55.038
That's a painted canvas,

34:55.455 --> 34:57.941
my grandfather used to do this in Africa to
protect himself from wild animals

34:58.076 --> 34:59.418
Well, we're not wild animals

34:59.459 --> 35:01.336
and we're not going to leave
this unhappy creature to die...

35:01.378 --> 35:02.880
Here, make yourself useful!

35:04.965 --> 35:07.971
Oh! Oh my god! Gondolo

35:11.934 --> 35:13.270
Selenia!

35:13.312 --> 35:14.439
Yes, take it easy, Gondolo.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.274
It's a... trap!

35:27.455 --> 35:28.372
Oh...! oh my god!

35:32.712 --> 35:33.588
Arthur!

35:33.714 --> 35:34.590
Clo... close the gate!

35:34.632 --> 35:35.718
Charge!

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Come on!

35:56.700 --> 35:59.000
Come on!

36:05.047 --> 36:06.382
Ready to fire!

36:11.473 --> 36:12.222
Watch out!

36:13.809 --> 36:15.354
Follow me to the palace!

36:15.938 --> 36:16.979
Hurry, father!

36:17.021 --> 36:18.981
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

36:24.823 --> 36:27.201
Hah! Oh, I am sorry, I'm so clumsy

36:32.168 --> 36:34.671
Ahem, perfect timing...
I rather fancied stretching my legs a little

36:35.171 --> 36:36.296
Father! Go and take cover, quickly!

36:36.337 --> 36:37.006
Out of the question!

36:37.048 --> 36:38.717
It's king's duty to face his destiny...

36:38.759 --> 36:40.051
and if only one person is left standing,

36:41.136 --> 36:41.219
I will be that person

36:43.766 --> 36:44.559
Ah!

36:46.102 --> 36:48.188
Art... we have to go on fighting!

36:48.223 --> 36:49.273
Sure, but with what?!

36:49.356 --> 36:50.274
Take my weapon.
I'll find another one!

36:56.489 --> 36:57.408
This is not working.

37:02.247 --> 37:04.835
Gentlemen, it's time to face up to reality.

37:06.672 --> 37:08.466
Watch out... the walls are booby trapped...

37:08.507 --> 37:10.635
fly close to the roof... it's much safer

37:10.969 --> 37:12.347
I couldn't agree with you more

37:13.055 --> 37:13.930
Come on, my lovebirds!

37:13.972 --> 37:15.765
This is your chance to prove you really
love each other

37:15.807 --> 37:16.683
Here you go

37:16.726 --> 37:18.311
Okay, we'll let them have
one final kiss

37:20.564 --> 37:22.943
Okay, that's enough now!

37:24.528 --> 37:25.196
When I blow my whistle,

37:25.697 --> 37:27.282
release your Romeo so he
can get back to his Juliet

37:27.407 --> 37:28.033
OK!

37:31.664 --> 37:33.248
Oh no!

37:53.316 --> 37:55.528
Hi! Okay, here we go

38:01.452 --> 38:02.538
Ah! Come on!

38:10.923 --> 38:13.092
Right, this can't be more complicated
than driving a car!

38:13.134 --> 38:16.848
Aah!

38:19.434 --> 38:20.895
Beta! Look out!

38:22.315 --> 38:24.776
Arthur,
I'll never forget you!

38:39.754 --> 38:44.010
No, you fool!
It's not feeding time!

38:45.387 --> 38:49.307
No... not the gap...!
Not the gap! Oh! Oh!

38:59.779 --> 39:03.620
Oh! oh! oh!

39:05.372 --> 39:07.331
OK... here we go again...!

39:09.251 --> 39:10.669
That's it, I've got it!

39:11.545 --> 39:12.881
And one mosquito down!

39:20.099 --> 39:22.269
That's better...
now let's go for it!

39:22.304 --> 39:24.271
How brave he is,

39:24.356 --> 39:24.523
how heroic!

39:24.565 --> 39:26.356
It's amazing how much
he's just like me!

39:26.398 --> 39:27.607
He'd make a good partner!

39:27.650 --> 39:28.943
Father, I'm old enough to look after
myself now

39:29.403 --> 39:30.154
Forget it... Forget it

39:32.615 --> 39:34.325
Oh! So who's next in line?

39:41.044 --> 39:41.921
Oh no!

39:42.379 --> 39:43.087
Oh yes!

39:43.130 --> 39:44.299
Betameche!

39:44.632 --> 39:45.089
Arthur?!

39:45.131 --> 39:46.008
Do something!

39:46.133 --> 39:47.844
Hang on, Arthur, I'm coming!

39:58.944 --> 40:00.737
What a gift he is!

40:03.491 --> 40:05.450
Come to think of it,
he does remind me of you.

40:07.078 --> 40:07.996
You OK? Nothing broken?

40:08.038 --> 40:09.748
I'm not sure.
I can't feel anything on my butt!

40:11.667 --> 40:13.879
Just one question...
where did you learn to fly like that!

40:13.921 --> 40:16.340
Umm,
driving with my grandfather.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.592
Oh, that makes sense.

40:18.177 --> 40:20.473
Let's rise to the occasion.

40:22.599 --> 40:25.060
Aaah... All's well that ends well.

40:29.649 --> 40:32.446
Mogoth! Let's show them
what we're made of!

40:36.409 --> 40:38.121
Selenia... The Master
wishes to see you.

40:38.162 --> 40:39.705
Follow us
and no harm will come to you!

40:39.747 --> 40:40.916
Come and get me!

40:40.958 --> 40:41.916
Right, go on, grab her!

40:41.958 --> 40:42.256
Why me?

40:42.291 --> 40:43.127
Well, who else?

40:43.168 --> 40:43.752
Well, you for example!

40:43.793 --> 40:44.669
Me? Why me?

40:44.877 --> 40:46.421
Four of you attacking one woman!

40:46.463 --> 40:47.674
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

40:47.716 --> 40:48.635
No!

40:48.676 --> 40:49.593
Pick on someone your own size!

40:49.636 --> 40:50.510
With pleasure...
With pleasure!

40:51.052 --> 40:52.264
Long live the king!

40:52.765 --> 40:53.892
Oh, my daughter!

41:01.816 --> 41:04.988
My daughter, my child,
I must do something!

41:05.030 --> 41:06.116
Cover me!

41:06.824 --> 41:07.742
...thank you.

41:14.209 --> 41:15.712
The sword of power.

41:20.258 --> 41:22.053
It's Miracle!

41:24.431 --> 41:25.933
OK, that's enough now.

41:25.974 --> 41:28.145
Get on your knees
and beg the Princess for forgiveness!

41:28.478 --> 41:29.313
Hmm!

41:38.908 --> 41:40.410
I said, on your knees!

41:40.452 --> 41:41.870
And beg the princess!

41:45.126 --> 41:47.795
Forgive us,
Princess Selenia

41:47.837 --> 41:49.298
I don't think we heard that.

41:49.340 --> 41:53.178
Our humblest apologies,
Princess Selenia.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.349
Pff, I'll think about it.

41:56.433 --> 41:58.852
That's my daughter,
just like her mother

41:58.893 --> 42:00.520
You fought like a prince!

42:00.562 --> 42:03.191
Thanks... This sword seems so light
it all seems so easy!

42:03.274 --> 42:03.860
Of course!

42:03.901 --> 42:04.776
It's magic sword.

42:04.860 --> 42:06.113
It's been embedded in that rock for years

42:06.154 --> 42:07.280
and you're the one who released it

42:07.364 --> 42:08.073
Really?!

42:08.115 --> 42:09.950
Oh yes, my friend... you're a hero now...

42:10.243 --> 42:17.377
Arthur the hero! Arthur the hero!
Arthur the hero!

42:17.412 --> 42:26.265
Long live Arthur the hero!

42:29.560 --> 42:31.230
Father! now that the sword has been freed
from the stone,

42:31.272 --> 42:32.440
we must act fast.

42:32.482 --> 42:34.360
I would like your permission
to continue my mission.

42:34.443 --> 42:35.318
Unfortunately,

42:35.400 --> 42:37.361
I have to agree with you, my child,

42:37.445 --> 42:38.863
but I must insist on one condition

42:38.905 --> 42:40.074
What condition is that?

42:40.116 --> 42:44.288
Arthur is brave and his heart is pure...
He will go with you.

42:44.371 --> 42:46.041
If that is what you wish, father

42:48.878 --> 42:52.090
I know you are going to make a fine team!

43:10.950 --> 43:12.077
The way is clear

43:12.118 --> 43:13.743
Are you sure that you
haven't forgotten anything?

43:13.785 --> 43:16.206
I'm sure, go ahead... let go

43:16.288 --> 43:18.750
Father
do we really have to take Betameche with us?

43:18.917 --> 43:20.712
Even if your brother is still young
one day he will be

43:21.338 --> 43:25.051
Arthur, if you should encounter
a small mole wearing glasses

43:25.093 --> 43:26.386
who answers to the name of Mino
on your travels...

43:26.470 --> 43:30.308
he is my son...
he's been missing for some three months now

43:30.433 --> 43:31.518
You can count on me.

43:31.727 --> 43:32.935
Alright, let's get going.

43:32.977 --> 43:34.020
Thank you, Arthur!

43:34.062 --> 43:35.690
Hey hero, let's go.

43:35.732 --> 43:36.899
Hey... wait for me

43:37.148 --> 43:41.030
You could at least wait for me!

43:42.824 --> 43:46.163
Oh... I do hope they won't fall into any traps.

43:55.383 --> 43:58.595
I slept like a rock

44:05.855 --> 44:08.568
Arthur, time to get up

44:25.966 --> 44:28.511
Selenia, slow down a bit, can't you?

44:28.553 --> 44:31.097
No way! It's your fault for loading yourself up
like a gamallus!

44:31.132 --> 44:33.641
I just packed a little bit of everything
y'know, just in case

44:33.683 --> 44:34.267
Uh... What's a gamallus?

44:34.309 --> 44:35.853
It's like a pachymollet, only much bigger.

44:36.021 --> 44:36.939
And what does a pachymollet look like?

44:36.981 --> 44:38.315
Like that!

44:40.526 --> 44:43.155
Any chance you got something in your bag
for dealing with pachymollets?

44:43.197 --> 44:45.659
Don't worry!
I've got my 300 function pocket knife here

44:45.701 --> 44:47.287
Double knife, multicrab clips,

44:47.329 --> 44:48.412
soap bubbles, music box

44:48.495 --> 44:50.246
and for when things get really hot... a fan!

44:50.288 --> 44:51.338
Hey, that's pretty handy alright!

44:51.373 --> 44:52.793
And then you've got all your classic functions:

44:52.835 --> 44:56.172
like your tulipan, matchet
sunjink, whistler, gullybar

44:56.214 --> 44:57.758
Nothing in there to cut off tongue
by any chance?

44:57.800 --> 45:00.053
No, but that's you specialty, isn't it?

45:00.635 --> 45:01.847
Stay right where you are!

45:03.976 --> 45:09.147
run on my signal... now!

45:15.072 --> 45:16.408
Here we are

45:23.166 --> 45:24.544
Anybody home?

45:24.586 --> 45:26.004
Not many people come through this way

45:26.045 --> 45:28.173
Once you've tried it, you'll understand why!

45:28.672 --> 45:30.259
Anybody home?

45:31.051 --> 45:32.889
Oh no! I... I'm sorry!

45:32.930 --> 45:34.056
I mistook you for a bell.

45:34.098 --> 45:38.021
Um, no, I mean
I didn't realize you were actually... alive!

45:38.062 --> 45:39.981
Hold on, ma que fa, stupido!

45:40.023 --> 45:40.482
What do you think

45:40.524 --> 45:42.110
you're doing knocking
out all o'my customers like that?

45:42.152 --> 45:44.071
It's not as if I got so many to start with.

45:44.113 --> 45:45.820
Hello. I am Princess Selenia.

45:45.862 --> 45:46.572
I know that...
and that is your stupido brother!

45:46.614 --> 45:48.325
So who's the third comedian

45:48.367 --> 45:51.120
who comes around knocking out
all the customers?

45:51.287 --> 45:54.042
My name's Arthur!
And I'm looking for my grandfather!

45:54.083 --> 45:56.711
Ah...?!
I transported a grandfather a few years ago

45:56.753 --> 46:02.011
An old eccentric madman
who absolutely insisted on being

46:02.054 --> 46:03.262
transported deep inside Seides territory... to

46:03.304 --> 46:04.680
That's him! That's my grandfather!

46:04.721 --> 46:06.308
And that's exactly where we wanna go!

46:06.433 --> 46:08.018
Sold out!

46:08.060 --> 46:08.476
Ah!

46:09.186 --> 46:11.899
Necropolis, sure,
why not the moon as well

46:16.990 --> 46:18.157
We didn't ask you for the moon,

46:18.199 --> 46:21.705
we asked for three tickets to Necropolis
is that clear enough?

46:30.256 --> 46:32.092
Arthur!

46:34.511 --> 46:38.434
Arthur?! You break my door to steal the key?!

46:38.476 --> 46:40.980
Answer me Arthur! Ah!

46:41.520 --> 46:43.189
Arthur!

46:47.888 --> 46:50.509
Oh, what a job.
Right this way.

46:50.510 --> 46:52.508
Come on, keep it moving
while we're young.

46:52.609 --> 46:55.509
Yes, that's a leaf.
Let's go, dandelion.

46:57.606 --> 47:01.213
Hey...! fasten your safety belts,
please.

47:01.756 --> 47:04.010
Arrivederci!

47:06.635 --> 47:10.185
Arthur?! Arthur?!

47:13.561 --> 47:16.093
The car...? What's the car doing there?

47:16.194 --> 47:20.692
Necropolis, ohh.
Oh, boy, here we go.

47:21.976 --> 47:23.948
Ah, here it is!

47:26.548 --> 47:28.477
Wow... That's cool

47:28.518 --> 47:30.449
I got another one just like it in pink...
wanna see it?

47:30.492 --> 47:32.421
Beta, we've got enough light already

47:34.394 --> 47:35.357
Arthur

47:36.112 --> 47:37.329
Where exactly are we heading?

47:37.371 --> 47:38.964
We are here... and we're going here!

47:39.005 --> 47:41.730
Oh my gosh, I know where that is.
That's right under the water tank.

47:41.772 --> 47:42.989
A giant water tank

47:43.032 --> 47:44.751
in the hands of that unspeakable piece of.

47:44.793 --> 47:46.051
Now I'm starting to understand

47:46.093 --> 47:46.932
Who are you talking about?

47:46.974 --> 47:48.777
The most evil of evil

47:48.820 --> 47:50.288
Oh...! MALTHAZAR?!

47:50.329 --> 47:51.422
Ooops!

47:55.825 --> 47:57.416
Holy humpbacked gamallus!

47:57.500 --> 47:59.263
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to hold your tongue?!

47:59.305 --> 48:00.563
I... I'm really sorry!

48:00.647 --> 48:02.198
Arthur?!

48:02.239 --> 48:03.877
Granny?

48:06.226 --> 48:08.533
And... we're off!

48:12.434 --> 48:13.398
Arthur?

48:15.159 --> 48:16.879
How long is the flight?

48:16.920 --> 48:19.813
It's pretty short as long as we can avoid
any unpleasant encounters

48:19.897 --> 48:22.121
What do you mean by...
unpleasant encounters?

48:40.115 --> 48:41.038
Holy bumblebee!

48:41.080 --> 48:43.009
He smashed the door in and now we're stuck

48:44.855 --> 48:46.112
Whoa!

48:46.196 --> 48:46.875
What is that?

48:46.911 --> 48:49.511
I have no idea, but I don't think
we should hang around to find out!

48:49.552 --> 48:50.181
Wh... what are you doing?

48:50.224 --> 48:51.566
I'm getting out of here... oops

48:55.463 --> 48:56.934
Hold on tight

49:02.637 --> 49:05.112
I like it much better when it stops.

49:05.153 --> 49:06.706
Somebody's going to get hurt with this

49:06.748 --> 49:09.768
I'll hang onto it... it'll be safer that way...

49:11.865 --> 49:13.081
Water!

49:13.583 --> 49:15.974
Do something, Arthur!? Get us out of this!

49:16.059 --> 49:18.491
It looks like you two are going to have
to get me out of this

49:18.533 --> 49:19.497
There's a hole in my boat!

49:19.540 --> 49:22.433
Minimoys... can't swim!

49:22.476 --> 49:23.440
I'm coming to get you, here I come

49:23.483 --> 49:26.964
Arthur! Arthur, please?!

49:27.048 --> 49:28.349
I'm coming... I'm coming. I'm coming.

49:28.473 --> 49:29.902
I know this river.

49:29.985 --> 49:31.368
First there's a bend to the right,

49:31.410 --> 49:33.757
then, there's a sharp bend to the left

49:35.728 --> 49:38.372
so to catch up with them, all I have to do is

49:38.414 --> 49:39.630
cut straight across as the crowflies

49:39.673 --> 49:43.196
Sorry, but as the crowflies is as the crowflies

49:50.409 --> 49:52.084
You see. I didn't abandon you

49:52.126 --> 49:52.757
Oh, great! So instead of the two of us drowning,

49:52.800 --> 49:55.569
now all three of us can drown together!

49:55.610 --> 49:56.740
No one's going to drown, Selenia!

49:56.782 --> 49:58.840
Surely, you're not going to let a li'l ol'
river frighten you, are you?

49:58.882 --> 50:02.445
It's not the river I'm frightened of... It's that!

50:03.914 --> 50:06.977
So, Mr. 'I'm here'
got any good ideas before we drown?

50:07.019 --> 50:08.026
Sure, course I have

50:08.277 --> 50:08.864
Beta, any chance there's a rope on

50:08.906 --> 50:11.462
that 300 function pocket knife of yours?

50:11.504 --> 50:14.021
Erm, no, that's only on the smaller model

50:15.574 --> 50:17.168
I've got an idea!

50:17.419 --> 50:19.516
Hey, just because we're going to die

50:19.559 --> 50:20.776
doesn't mean you can start taking liberties!

50:20.817 --> 50:22.034
No, you've got it all wrong!

50:22.076 --> 50:24.258
I need the lace to reach that tree,
over there

50:24.300 --> 50:25.808
I'm not so sure about this idea of yours

50:25.893 --> 50:26.901
Well, I'm sure!

50:27.655 --> 50:29.541
Arthur
have you ever thrown a sword like that before?

50:29.582 --> 50:31.888
No, but it can't be much more difficult
than playing darts.

50:32.687 --> 50:35.161
Betameche you go first! Selenia you next!

50:35.197 --> 50:36.042
Yes, sir

50:36.083 --> 50:37.594
Your turn Selenia.

50:38.475 --> 50:39.944
Betameche, hurry up!

50:39.985 --> 50:41.496
I can't, I'm slipping!

50:41.787 --> 50:44.516
Selenia, hold on with both hands!

50:44.557 --> 50:46.485
Absolutely no way!

50:52.650 --> 50:53.530
Whew, we're safe!

50:53.573 --> 50:55.544
Not quite!

50:58.859 --> 51:01.628
Come on, Arthur, hurry up
we haven't got all day

51:01.669 --> 51:02.507
I'm coming.

51:04.354 --> 51:07.204
Selenia, you gotta admit it
the guy is pretty agile.

51:07.247 --> 51:09.678
It's easy when you've got both hands free

51:11.859 --> 51:12.865
Thanks

51:13.922 --> 51:16.137
Arthur, you were fantastic!

51:16.179 --> 51:19.410
Right, maybe Mr.
Fantastic can return my lace now?!

51:20.417 --> 51:22.850
It's already so hard without my husband,

51:22.893 --> 51:24.905
I don't know how I'll survive without Arthur

51:25.339 --> 51:26.916
I'm sure he's just run away for a spell.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.594
All of these events have probably upset him

51:28.636 --> 51:29.349
Yes...

51:29.391 --> 51:31.572
I don't think he could have gotten far,

51:31.613 --> 51:32.916
and we've gonna do everything
we can to find him, ma'am.

51:32.957 --> 51:35.892
- Okay.
- You can count on us. Bye.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.500
What was that?

51:56.600 --> 51:57.800
- Humans.
- Really?

51:57.900 --> 51:59.338
Yep, sometime it's like that all day long!

51:59.380 --> 52:01.351
Aw, rats, this map's a total washout

52:01.394 --> 52:02.568
How are we ever going to find our way now?

52:02.652 --> 52:05.000
We'll use the position
of the sun to guide us when it comes up

52:05.042 --> 52:06.594
in the meantime,
let's look for a place to sleep

52:06.679 --> 52:07.642
And make sure you find us something comfy
Selenia,

52:07.726 --> 52:09.235
'cause I ache all over

52:09.277 --> 52:12.299
Beta, if you complain once more
you can go sleep under a bullmunch.

52:12.342 --> 52:13.808
What's bullmunch?

52:13.850 --> 52:16.661
It's like a gamallus, only much, much bigger.

52:19.345 --> 52:20.897
Beta, I'm going to need your knife.

52:20.939 --> 52:21.778
Coming right up...!

52:22.449 --> 52:24.126
Ummm... Where did they put the METAGLUE?

52:25.300 --> 52:26.724
Whoops... sorry!

52:26.893 --> 52:29.535
Give that to me, Beta!
Before you end up hurting somebody!

52:29.577 --> 52:31.884
Just hang on, I haven't had it very long!
I just got it for my birthday.

52:31.926 --> 52:32.472
How old are you?

52:32.513 --> 52:33.563
I'm three hundred years old...

52:33.605 --> 52:35.661
only another sixty years
and I will be a grown-up

52:35.702 --> 52:37.087
How old's Selenia then?

52:37.129 --> 52:38.427
Almost a thousand years old.

52:38.469 --> 52:39.476
A thousand years old?

52:39.519 --> 52:42.747
Oh, yes... the age of reason...
It's her birthday in two days.

52:42.789 --> 52:46.019
How is this working? Got it!

52:58.477 --> 52:59.188
Whoa.

52:59.231 --> 53:00.574
What's she up to?

53:00.617 --> 53:02.208
She's making the bed.

53:02.251 --> 53:04.766
Wooh, I'm exhausted

53:05.605 --> 53:06.487
Goodnight!

53:08.291 --> 53:10.303
Well, he certainly doesn't having
any trouble sleeping, does he?

53:10.345 --> 53:11.856
It's normal, he's still young.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.072
Three hundred years young! It's not bad!

53:13.108 --> 53:14.163
Ah... so good.

53:19.741 --> 53:25.067
What about you...

53:25.108 --> 53:27.877
are you really going to
be a thousand years old in two days?

53:27.919 --> 53:30.059
Aaah, yes... and in two days time

53:30.101 --> 53:33.624
I am to succeed my father
and watch over the Minimoy people until

53:33.665 --> 53:35.510
it shall come to pass that my own children

53:35.552 --> 53:38.321
reach the age of one thousand
and succeed me

53:38.363 --> 53:40.039
such is the tradition!

53:40.458 --> 53:43.227
But to have children
you need a... husband.

53:43.262 --> 53:44.612
I know, but I'm not worried,

53:44.654 --> 53:48.346
I still have two whole days to find one...
And now...

53:48.386 --> 53:52.833
Goodnight... Arthur!

53:52.875 --> 53:55.810
Goodnight, princess.

54:04.859 --> 54:06.438
Arthur?

54:41.419 --> 54:42.882
Come on, time to get up boys!

54:42.924 --> 54:44.805
We've got a long journey ahead of us today!

54:51.368 --> 54:53.582
Hello, I said, get up

54:54.916 --> 54:56.799
OK! This calls for a change of tactic!

54:56.840 --> 54:58.763
Argh! Ow!

54:59.724 --> 55:01.563
Come on now, shower time!

55:02.399 --> 55:04.614
That's what I call a rude awakening!

55:04.783 --> 55:05.491
Consider yourself lucky!

55:05.533 --> 55:06.120
She's been waking me up
like that every morning

55:06.162 --> 55:08.880
for the last three hundred years!

55:24.928 --> 55:26.639
Mmm... these are even better
than the other ones!

55:26.681 --> 55:27.599
Here, try some!

55:28.687 --> 55:29.358
Mmum... tastes good!

55:29.399 --> 55:30.275
What is it exactly?

55:30.317 --> 55:31.529
Dragonfly eggs

55:32.740 --> 55:34.619
Hey, come and take a look at this!

55:37.923 --> 55:39.845
Oh...! that's awful!

55:40.431 --> 55:44.234
I suppose... uh, seen from this angle...
it is less attractive

55:44.276 --> 55:46.994
Anybody have an idea what this thing is for?!

55:47.036 --> 55:49.751
It's an irrigation system... It transports water

55:49.794 --> 55:51.130
Water! More water!?

55:51.172 --> 55:52.467
I'm... really sorry, I had absolutely no idea that

55:52.509 --> 55:53.845
Wait wait wait, wait a minute,

55:53.887 --> 55:56.187
you mean that you're the one
who built this monstrosity?!

55:56.228 --> 55:59.614
Yes... But I only wanted to water the radishes...
Granny loves radishes

55:59.697 --> 56:01.912
You mean
you actually eat those disgusting things?

56:01.954 --> 56:03.125
Let's just hope that your invention

56:03.167 --> 56:05.341
doesn't fall into the hands of the Evil M

56:05.382 --> 56:07.973
otherwise... I have a pretty good idea
of what he'll do with it.

56:18.212 --> 56:20.175
My straws, they're stealing my straws!

56:20.218 --> 56:21.390
As long as they're getting rid of those things,

56:21.431 --> 56:22.600
I'd say they're doing us a favor.

56:22.643 --> 56:24.823
Try thinking before you talk, Betameche!

56:24.858 --> 56:28.035
The Evil M. knows only too well that
the Minimoys can't stand water,

56:28.076 --> 56:28.917
and your friend, Arthur here,

56:28.952 --> 56:31.502
just provided him
with the means to transport water

56:31.544 --> 56:32.964
where do you suppose he'll send it to?

56:33.005 --> 56:34.468
Oh...! our village!

56:35.931 --> 56:37.395
Arthur, where are you going?

56:37.438 --> 56:39.318
To repair the damage I've done.

56:39.945 --> 56:42.284
I can't believe that guy
humans are really crazy.

56:42.326 --> 56:44.333
That may be, but I think Arthur's right

56:44.374 --> 56:46.674
they're bound to take the straws to Necropolis

56:46.716 --> 56:47.760
...and us along with them

56:47.801 --> 56:49.724
I never get to decide anything!

56:50.935 --> 56:52.606
It's really nice of you to come with me

56:52.647 --> 56:55.281
I'm just worried you're gonna
do something stupid if I'm not around

56:59.754 --> 57:02.096
Psst! Beta... hurry up!

57:07.277 --> 57:08.865
Beta, your foot!

57:08.947 --> 57:09.699
Oh no!

57:09.742 --> 57:11.371
Here we go again.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.217
Do you know
at least where this waterway leads to?

57:15.259 --> 57:17.935
No! But, in any case
all rivers and waterways meet up at some point!

57:20.735 --> 57:22.741
You always have such brilliant ideas
don't you?!

57:22.783 --> 57:24.120
Don't worry, I'll take care of it
give me back your lace.

57:24.162 --> 57:27.420
Absolutely NO WAY.

57:28.715 --> 57:29.929
Hold on tight!

57:39.206 --> 57:41.132
I hate public transportation!

57:41.924 --> 57:44.015
He's coming this way... He's coming this way!

57:55.130 --> 58:00.813
Hey-oh! Hey... what you playin' at down there?

58:00.855 --> 58:03.781
Uh... if the Seides find us first
we won't have a chance to tell you.

58:03.823 --> 58:05.159
The Seides?

58:06.830 --> 58:07.792
You got a problem?

58:07.834 --> 58:09.132
Nope, it's nothin',

58:09.174 --> 58:10.926
I was just checkin' that
the accordion part ain't damaged

58:10.968 --> 58:12.515
We don't need that part
we're only interested in the stems!

58:12.557 --> 58:14.355
Oh, yeah, the stems, sure thing

58:14.396 --> 58:15.901
Get a move on, the master is waiting

58:15.943 --> 58:18.994
Oh, yeah, the master,
sure thing No problemo!

58:22.548 --> 58:24.802
whatever you do don't move until
I come back and get you, got it?

58:24.844 --> 58:26.265
No problemo!

58:27.603 --> 58:29.442
So where are these refugees of yours?

58:29.484 --> 58:31.574
I've hidden them
in a mega discreet place!

58:38.009 --> 58:38.888
Pretty cool, huh?

58:38.930 --> 58:41.060
Yup, and mega discreet like you said.

58:42.272 --> 58:43.985
Jackfire all 'round!

58:44.237 --> 58:45.991
Yes please! Yes yes yes!

58:46.033 --> 58:46.994
sure thanks

58:47.079 --> 58:48.039
Hey, Jack!? Fill 'em up,

58:48.081 --> 58:49.376
this one's on me!

58:51.719 --> 58:53.641
oh good

58:57.235 --> 59:01.537
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

59:02.498 --> 59:04.304
Cool!

59:05.547 --> 59:07.053
Aah! Just what I needed.

59:07.095 --> 59:09.247
Oh, yep, that hits the spot!

59:09.595 --> 59:12.138
<???????>

59:12.889 --> 59:14.681
Ah sorry

59:14.723 --> 59:16.765
To the Seven Kingdoms!

59:22.476 --> 59:23.686
That's refreshing stuff!

59:23.728 --> 59:26.311
As long as you here with me
there's really nothing to fear.

59:26.353 --> 59:28.313
I'm the boss here. My name is Max.

59:28.355 --> 59:29.279
Hiya Max!

59:29.313 --> 59:31.271
And you, young lady, who might you be?

59:31.313 --> 59:34.523
Selenia.
Daughter of Emperor SIFRAT of MATRADOY,

59:34.565 --> 59:36.149
the fifteenth of that name
governor of the First Kingdom.

59:36.191 --> 59:39.983
Wow! Delighted to meet you, baby!

59:40.150 --> 59:42.148
Jack, same again

59:43.944 --> 59:45.527
Hey, yo Easylow!

59:45.569 --> 59:46.989
Yes boss?

59:47.029 --> 59:48.695
let's get this show on the road!

59:48.737 --> 59:49.990
You got it!

59:53.657 --> 59:56.032
May I have the honor of this dance, Princess?

59:56.074 --> 59:58.701
Selenia? We ought to be making a move
we've still got a long way to go!

59:58.743 --> 01:00:00.032
Certainly.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:12.083
Pff... she's too old for me anyway!
She's a thousand, I'm only ten!

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:14.083
What would I want with an older woman?

01:00:18.375 --> 01:00:21.710
What's a good lookin' kid like you doin'
in front of an empty glass?

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:24.794
well if wasn't empty you couldn't fill it up
could you?

01:00:24.836 --> 01:00:26.588
I like your sense of humor, kid...

01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:30.133
we're gonna get along just fine... Jack!

01:00:31.049 --> 01:00:32.384
Hey hey hey, take it easy

01:00:32.425 --> 01:00:35.093
If you want to find a husband in two days
then, there's no time to lose!

01:00:35.134 --> 01:00:36.885
But, I can help you out if you like...

01:00:36.926 --> 01:00:38.300
That's sweet of you, thanks.

01:00:38.336 --> 01:00:39.134
I like to help out,

01:00:39.175 --> 01:00:41.052
besides which
things are pretty tame right now.

01:00:41.094 --> 01:00:42.763
I only have seven wives.

01:00:42.804 --> 01:00:45.764
Wow! Seven wives? That a...
must take a lot out of you!

01:00:45.805 --> 01:00:47.472
I like hard work,

01:00:47.514 --> 01:00:49.142
I can work night and day seven days a week

01:00:49.182 --> 01:00:51.475
and I never get tired.

01:00:51.517 --> 01:00:52.976
Ah, ah, ah, Wonderful

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.351
So, where do I sign?

01:00:56.393 --> 01:00:59.770
Anywhere you like
kid it doesn't make any difference.

01:01:03.606 --> 01:01:07.899
Excuse me, but...
he's already signed up elsewhere.

01:01:09.649 --> 01:01:13.326
Selenia, it's... are you really gonna
be a thousand years old?

01:01:13.362 --> 01:01:16.943
Yes, but we count the years in Selenielle blooms
Selenielle's the royal flower.

01:01:16.986 --> 01:01:20.863
Ah! OK, Selenielles.
So, how old does that make me?

01:01:20.905 --> 01:01:22.198
about the same age as me!

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.030
Wow, that's amazing!

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:26.198
And uh... So, before
were you a little girl like me?

01:01:26.242 --> 01:01:26.742
what?

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.473
no, uh I mean, I'm a boy of course

01:01:29.474 --> 01:01:32.162
but were you a little girl like the
other little girls in my neighborhood?

01:01:32.203 --> 01:01:36.160
No, I was born as I am... and I've never
set foot outside the Seven Kingdoms.

01:01:36.201 --> 01:01:38.663
I'd really like to take you to my world one day.

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:46.833
That's Malthazar!?

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:50.003
No, lucky for you, it's only Darkos, his son.

01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:55.169
Hey... Darkos this is an honor!

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:01.006
Hey... Great timing, there's quite a vibe
going down here this evening.

01:02:01.048 --> 01:02:02.007
I can see that."

01:02:02.049 --> 01:02:05.717
Organizing parties without inviting
our friends now are we?

01:02:05.759 --> 01:02:07.972
No way, it wasn't planned

01:02:08.073 --> 01:02:11.384
Just a little something we improvised...
to impress the newpunters, you know...

01:02:11.426 --> 01:02:12.844
New faces?

01:02:14.344 --> 01:02:16.054
Warn me if he comes this way

01:02:17.889 --> 01:02:20.097
Hey, Darkos... What's up?

01:02:20.139 --> 01:02:24.349
Selenia... what's a princess of your rank doing
in a place like this?

01:02:24.385 --> 01:02:25.561
I just dropped in for a dance.

01:02:25.602 --> 01:02:28.394
Ah, Well then... let's dance!

01:02:28.436 --> 01:02:29.518
Darkos, sweetheart

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.562
I would rather DIE than dance with you!

01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:34.021
Your wish is my command, Princess!

01:02:34.063 --> 01:02:36.441
you will dance... for all eternity!

01:02:37.023 --> 01:02:38.898
Easylow, get this place rockin

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.482
GET THEM!

01:02:55.113 --> 01:02:56.489
Arthur! Look out!

01:02:58.866 --> 01:03:03.494
Hey, they're putting up a good fight
Let's see if they've got the groove.

01:03:24.879 --> 01:03:27.086
Huh-huh-hun-hun

01:03:27.127 --> 01:03:29.338
h... I think I'll go get some reinforcements

01:03:32.132 --> 01:03:33.632
Hey, I like this kid

01:03:33.882 --> 01:03:35.264
Oh! Three against one, huh?

01:03:35.298 --> 01:03:36.718
Then I'll just triple the power!

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:37.884
Oh how sweet!

01:03:37.926 --> 01:03:39.051
So... You shouldn't have!

01:03:39.093 --> 01:03:40.886
Really, it was nothing

01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:46.971
Woooh, that's my girl

01:03:52.099 --> 01:03:53.725
Holy gullybars! You scared me!

01:03:53.766 --> 01:03:54.351
What are you doing here?

01:03:54.392 --> 01:03:56.852
I lost my knife,
I gotta find something else.

01:03:58.518 --> 01:03:59.602
You find anything?

01:04:08.189 --> 01:04:09.064
my knife!

01:04:11.273 --> 01:04:14.692
Wooh, that's entertainment!

01:04:21.195 --> 01:04:23.946
Easylow, closing time I think!

01:04:26.073 --> 01:04:27.115
Charge.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:28.697
CHARGE, MY BUTT.

01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:33.367
Got 'em! There they are!

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:34.450
I've got one, I got one!

01:04:34.492 --> 01:04:35.786
Let go of me, you idiot!

01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:36.785
Ow! One of them bit me!

01:04:36.828 --> 01:04:37.451
Sorry, boss!

01:04:37.494 --> 01:04:38.662
Somebody turn the lights on!

01:04:43.453 --> 01:04:44.705
What's going on?

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:47.791
I'm just following your orders
my Lord, ten o'clock curfew!

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:49.123
and it's ten o'clock!
(blows out the smoke)

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:54.128
Late opening authorization granted!

01:04:54.336 --> 01:04:57.170
cool, real cool!

01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:59.381
Come on man, follow me!

01:05:02.297 --> 01:05:04.673
Look, if you go this way, you'll travel safe!

01:05:05.174 --> 01:05:06.506
Oh, great!

01:05:06.547 --> 01:05:10.135
This is from Max!
it will lead you right to M's quarters.

01:05:14.763 --> 01:05:18.472
Oh, I'm sure glad me ain't goin' along!

01:05:21.805 --> 01:05:23.930
Get out, move aside!

01:05:24.725 --> 01:05:29.394
I... want... them!

01:05:30.477 --> 01:05:31.979
What was that unearthly scream?

01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:34.772
Oh, just Darkos throwing
a little temper tantrum.

01:05:34.812 --> 01:05:36.521
Do you think Max will be able to delay him
for long?

01:05:36.563 --> 01:05:40.189
Max is a real smooth talker
I think we can count on him. Come on, let's go

01:05:40.224 --> 01:05:42.731
Oh yeah right, how can you even think about
trusting a guy like that?

01:05:42.774 --> 01:05:46.109
Don't start Betameche!
Just keep walking and shut up, please

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.944
Um...! Wh-w-what's that growling noise?!

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:50.778
What growling noise? I don't hear anything

01:05:50.819 --> 01:05:52.488
Cut it out, Selenia! I know you're just saying
that to give me the creeps!

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:53.906
Come on, what was it?

01:05:53.907 --> 01:05:54.907
Yetti.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.754
It's growling because
you woke him up.

01:05:56.855 --> 01:05:59.400
Now he's gonna eat you.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.115
The Yeti?! Really?!

01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:16.454
Surprise

01:06:16.496 --> 01:06:19.455
Well this is... a... surprise

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:20.830
Where's Arthur?

01:06:20.874 --> 01:06:24.252
In the garden

01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:26.669
In the... In the garden?

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:29.005
This is it!

01:06:29.087 --> 01:06:32.298
Thank you, Betameche! Without you,
we'd be completely lost! Now, give me your knife!

01:06:32.339 --> 01:06:33.757
Okay, but don't break it!

01:06:37.173 --> 01:06:38.549
Come on, boys, let's go.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.050
Mmmm, after you, Selenia!

01:06:40.092 --> 01:06:40.925
Princesses first.

01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:43.718
Men only act like gentlemen
when it suits them, huh?

01:06:45.136 --> 01:06:46.011
Hmm

01:06:47.345 --> 01:06:49.888
Well, uh... princes second

01:06:56.683 --> 01:06:58.310
Guess it's my turn,

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:08.439
what do you mean he disappeared?

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:13.524
Every night I told him stories
about his Grandpa's adventures in Africa.

01:07:13.566 --> 01:07:17.108
And, last night
I told him about the Minimoys

01:07:17.143 --> 01:07:18.318
The Mini what?

01:07:18.358 --> 01:07:23.403
The Minimoys, and, um... he became
convinced that they live in our garden.

01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:23.945
In the garden?

01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:25.988
These are just fairy tales
and legends, Granny

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.530
Of course, but then,

01:07:28.673 --> 01:07:32.824
since I made the mistake of letting him
know about our money problems,

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.887
he got it into his head to
find the treasure that grandpa hid.

01:07:38.604 --> 01:07:40.308
What treasure?

01:07:42.182 --> 01:07:46.510
Honey, what's the use of finding the treasure
if Arthur isn't here to enjoy it?

01:07:46.966 --> 01:07:50.563
Don't worry, Granny.
I'm sure Arthur will be right back.

01:07:50.605 --> 01:07:54.284
He, he just took a little time off that's all...
No, in the hole

01:07:54.326 --> 01:07:56.068
- Sorry!
- ...not the face.

01:07:57.775 --> 01:08:00.021
Hurry!

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:05.953
Shhh

01:08:06.055 --> 01:08:07.771
Selenia, it's crawling with Seides!

01:08:07.813 --> 01:08:09.896
Huh... what do you think
we're hiding for?

01:08:14.638 --> 01:08:15.252
What are they doing?

01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:18.389
They must be taking food to their Master...
let's follow them

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.194
- Do you think he's there?
- Yes.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.261
Wh-wh-what are we gonna do. Selenia?

01:08:28.303 --> 01:08:29.638
I'm gonna spoil his lunch

01:08:30.483 --> 01:08:33.345
oh... he's not going to like that!

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.300
But

01:08:35.643 --> 01:08:38.895
This is where our paths separate, Arthur
I have to deal with this alone

01:08:38.938 --> 01:08:40.354
What do you mean?
I thought we were a team?

01:08:40.397 --> 01:08:43.523
Well, the team is about to split up!
You're gonna go look for your treasure...

01:08:43.732 --> 01:08:45.233
and I'm gonna take care of M...

01:08:45.274 --> 01:08:47.236
If I succeed, we'll meet back here

01:08:47.278 --> 01:08:48.776
If I should fail...

01:08:48.818 --> 01:08:53.198
I bequeath all my powers to you

01:08:53.238 --> 01:08:54.325
What do you mean?

01:08:59.661 --> 01:09:01.122
Be a good king...!

01:09:01.163 --> 01:09:03.457
But, wait... we have to

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.752
Sele-

01:09:06.916 --> 01:09:10.100
Congratulations, Arthur
it was a wonderful (wedding)..."

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.126
really one of the loveliest weddings
I've ever been to! Very moving,

01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:14.219
clear, concise and quick...!

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.341
Yeah... A little too quick.

01:09:15.383 --> 01:09:17.259
Oh, no, you got
the most important things,"

01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:18.095
her hand and her heart...

01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:18.886
what more do you want?

01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:21.640
Well, I don't know...
maybe like a party or something?

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.471
If you would allow me the pleasure

01:09:23.513 --> 01:09:27.102
I would love to be
the one to organize that party!

01:09:56.379 --> 01:09:59.340
I spend entire days polishing
that sword to perfection

01:09:59.465 --> 01:10:02.090
I'd recognize that sound anywhere...

01:10:04.926 --> 01:10:06.260
And who else would have been
able to draw the sword

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:11.892
from the stone besides you, Selenia?

01:10:12.143 --> 01:10:14.518
I am delighted to see you, Princess.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.983
Likewise! This way I'll be able
to kill you with my own two hands

01:10:18.024 --> 01:10:19.522
Why so much hatred?

01:10:19.564 --> 01:10:20.861
Because you betrayed your own people,"

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:24.316
slaughtered entire populations
and bound the rest into slavery...

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.862
you're nothing but a monster!

01:10:25.896 --> 01:10:27.328
Speak not of monsters...!

01:10:27.363 --> 01:10:29.783
Nor of things which you are ignorant!

01:10:30.198 --> 01:10:33.662
Back in the time when
I was known as Malthazar the Good,

01:10:33.702 --> 01:10:35.042
Malthazar the Bountiful

01:10:35.078 --> 01:10:37.290
He who watches and protects
I inspired such trust and confidence...

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:39.788
that when the drought came

01:10:39.832 --> 01:10:42.541
one which lasted a thousand years...

01:10:42.582 --> 01:10:44.878
I was the one they chose for the crusade

01:10:44.919 --> 01:10:46.961
with the task of bringing back water
of course

01:10:47.003 --> 01:10:49.549
but also, all the riches I could reap

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:52.300
Malthazar the Conqueror!

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:55.181
How they praised and applauded me when I left

01:10:55.222 --> 01:10:58.097
but I faced every hardship quit alone

01:10:58.139 --> 01:11:02.475
the hostile lands, the ferocious beasts
the bloodthirsty tribes

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.853
lurking in the depths of contaminated plateaus

01:11:04.895 --> 01:11:06.897
where even the humans dare not go

01:11:06.938 --> 01:11:09.105
But I survived all that.

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:10.777
And having accomplished my mission,"

01:11:10.818 --> 01:11:15.489
I returned to my village... Malthazar the Hero!

01:11:16.823 --> 01:11:22.159
yet, it was not long
before the diseases and bewitchments

01:11:22.202 --> 01:11:24.330
which I had encountered during my voyage began to
disfigure my body

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:26.831
Fear spread through the people...
fear of contamination...

01:11:26.872 --> 01:11:29.959
people stopped speaking to me

01:11:29.999 --> 01:11:33.963
They crossed the street when I approached...

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:37.922
and very soon
I became Malthazar... the Evil M!

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.259
Uh, uh. The version recorded in history books
is slightly different.

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.304
It is said that
when you returned from your voyage

01:11:43.346 --> 01:11:44.555
you celebrated for months on end

01:11:44.596 --> 01:11:48.767
each day sinking a little further into
drinking and debauchery

01:11:48.808 --> 01:11:53.979
until you began keeping company
with the worst kinds of insects,

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.938
even poisonous ones..."

01:11:55.981 --> 01:11:56.897
like a certain pretty, young... uh... weevil

01:11:56.939 --> 01:11:57.447
Silence!

01:11:57.483 --> 01:11:59.358
You gave your powers to her
she gave her powers to you!

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:01.023
That's enough, I tell you!

01:12:02.862 --> 01:12:04.446
I was drunk!

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:07.530
Ah, well, if you can't hold your liquor
you shouldn't indulge.

01:12:07.572 --> 01:12:10.160
Yes, I know. I let myself go a bit and..."

01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:12.416
it's true, she stole a kiss from me.

01:12:12.452 --> 01:12:15.333
One single kiss which has ruined my entire life.

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:17.999
Next time, try being a little more selective
in your choice of partner.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.379
Next time
my partner will be the most beautiful of all

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.632
she whom
I have watched blossom like a delicate flower...

01:12:25.673 --> 01:12:29.842
and whom I have long dreamt of... picking

01:12:29.926 --> 01:12:32.599
Watch yourself...
delicate flowers might have thorns!

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.140
Yes... and this lovely flower alone has
the power to release me

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.808
from the spell that binds me
and make me look like my old self again.

01:12:40.852 --> 01:12:43.106
Only the very first kiss of
a princess has the power

01:12:43.147 --> 01:12:46.564
I know, and... if my information is correct...

01:12:46.608 --> 01:12:48.441
you are still unmarried

01:12:48.484 --> 01:12:51.404
Your information is a little out - of-date.

01:12:52.738 --> 01:12:53.490
Master

01:12:53.529 --> 01:12:55.073
Who dares disturb me?!

01:12:55.115 --> 01:12:57.281
I have news of the utmost urgency
and importance

01:12:57.617 --> 01:12:58.909
Speak up!

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:08.876
Well, Selenia...
you're more clever than I thought you were.

01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:09.796
Thank you.

01:13:09.837 --> 01:13:12.297
You could have saved my life
but you chose not to

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.879
Don't count on me to spare yours!

01:13:16.175 --> 01:13:19.261
Don't worry, Selenia
you won't die right away

01:13:19.303 --> 01:13:20.929
You'll just suffer a little first,"

01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:24.059
as you watch the destruction
of your people...

01:13:24.849 --> 01:13:26.642
You're a monster, Malthazar!

01:13:26.677 --> 01:13:28.438
I know, I get if from my wife

01:13:28.479 --> 01:13:29.688
Take her away!

01:13:35.066 --> 01:13:37.693
Leave me alone, let me go!

01:13:41.489 --> 01:13:43.531
I'm married five minutes,

01:13:43.573 --> 01:13:44.702
and I already feel like a widower,
and a jailbird!

01:13:44.743 --> 01:13:45.870
We gotta get out of here, Beta..."

01:13:45.912 --> 01:13:46.742
we gotta think of something.

01:13:46.784 --> 01:13:47.993
I'm thinking, Arthur, I'm thinking...!

01:13:48.037 --> 01:13:48.619
The powers...

01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:49.957
what about the powers she gave me
when she kissed me?

01:13:49.999 --> 01:13:50.334
I don't know!

01:13:50.369 --> 01:13:51.081
What do you mean, you don't know!

01:13:51.122 --> 01:13:52.666
Strangling him won't do you any good!

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:55.794
And besides, you'd better save your energy
if you want to eat!

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.169
What do you mean?

01:13:57.212 --> 01:13:58.211
If you want to eat down here,"

01:13:58.252 --> 01:14:00.130
you'll have to teach them something new
every day,

01:14:00.171 --> 01:14:03.258
otherwise you'll go hungry...
and it makes sense... complete sense...

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.423
knowledge is the one true source of wealth
is it not?!

01:14:05.459 --> 01:14:07.010
What kinds of things do they want to know?

01:14:07.429 --> 01:14:08.430
Pfff... anything will do!

01:14:08.472 --> 01:14:11.387
From the elementary laws of physics to
the behavioral patterns of winkles...

01:14:11.423 --> 01:14:13.974
even how to cook garden peas.
I taught them to write

01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:16.275
And to paint, especially huge canvasses..."

01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:19.564
and to harness light using mirrors
And transport water from one place to another

01:14:19.604 --> 01:14:21.773
Yes...
that's true, but how did you know all that?

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.111
Because the man who invented all those
wonderful things is my grandfather!

01:14:25.153 --> 01:14:25.901
Arthur?!

01:14:25.943 --> 01:14:26.778
Grandpa!

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:31.530
Oh my grandson
I'm so happy to see you again!"

01:14:31.573 --> 01:14:34.241
Let me look at you... my, how you've grown!

01:14:34.283 --> 01:14:35.496
It feels more like I've shrunk!

01:14:35.536 --> 01:14:38.455
Yes, that's true.
But how did you manage to get down here?

01:14:38.496 --> 01:14:40.082
Well, I found your riddle

01:14:40.124 --> 01:14:43.584
Oh, yes, of course! My riddle
oh, you are a true hero!

01:14:43.627 --> 01:14:45.797
Hello, Archibald, remember me?

01:14:45.839 --> 01:14:48.463
Betameche?! Is that really you?

01:14:48.505 --> 01:14:50.713
Oh... I'm so happy to see you again..."

01:14:50.755 --> 01:14:52.091
How is your father, that noble king?

01:14:52.133 --> 01:14:53.508
Very well indeed, thank you.

01:14:53.549 --> 01:14:57.097
and your sister, the charming Princess Selenia?

01:14:59.057 --> 01:15:00.391
Selenia!

01:15:00.891 --> 01:15:06.062
I failed, Arthur... I'm sorry, all is lost!

01:15:06.104 --> 01:15:07.814
No, as long as we're still alive"

01:15:07.856 --> 01:15:09.771
and love each other, nothing will ever be lost

01:15:09.813 --> 01:15:11.313
You are so full of hope!

01:15:11.438 --> 01:15:13.066
You can never give up hope."

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:16.404
Look at me, only yesterday
I was just a small, lonely kid,

01:15:16.439 --> 01:15:19.032
and today, well, I married a princess!

01:15:19.073 --> 01:15:21.075
a happy princess.

01:15:21.575 --> 01:15:25.286
Because she's finally found her prince charming

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.914
W- W-Whoa! Time out!

01:15:29.956 --> 01:15:30.917
I don't mean to be rude,"

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:33.418
but don't you think you
should maybe respect the tradition...?

01:15:33.794 --> 01:15:36.924
Hey, yes, he's right, what was I thinking?

01:15:36.964 --> 01:15:40.341
Oh, hey, Archibald...! how are you?

01:15:40.384 --> 01:15:42.011
Well, actually... not bad at all, Selenia,"

01:15:42.053 --> 01:15:43.261
what a pleasure to see you again

01:15:43.303 --> 01:15:44.308
Likewise, likewise!

01:15:44.343 --> 01:15:46.179
Selenia, what's this tradition business?

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.720
Once the first kiss has been exchanged,

01:15:47.764 --> 01:15:49.352
then you have to wait another thousand years,

01:15:49.388 --> 01:15:51.392
because then desire
and faith have to be put to the test...

01:15:51.433 --> 01:15:53.061
that which is rare is always valued highly

01:15:53.102 --> 01:15:54.230
She has a point, you know

01:15:54.312 --> 01:15:55.018
And as a Princess,"

01:15:55.061 --> 01:15:57.440
it is my duty to follow
the teachings of the Great Book...

01:15:57.482 --> 01:15:59.025
besides, you ought to do the same,

01:15:59.068 --> 01:16:00.401
instead of trying to steal kisses from me!

01:16:00.443 --> 01:16:02.901
Me? It wasn't me, you were the one

01:16:04.152 --> 01:16:08.240
Come along now, you two lovebirds
it's showtime!

01:16:09.739 --> 01:16:10.783
If you would care to

01:16:11.202 --> 01:16:13.330
Gate open, boss.

01:16:25.339 --> 01:16:26.379
My God...

01:16:26.421 --> 01:16:27.674
When I think that
it was I that taught them all this

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.967
and now they are going to use it against us!

01:16:30.008 --> 01:16:32.135
And when I think
that I was the one who gave them the straws...!

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:47.606
Look! It's Mino, Miro's son, he's still alive!

01:16:52.862 --> 01:16:54.114
the treasure!

01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:03.079
Ah, Archibald
what a great pleasure it is to see you again...

01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:04.253
The pleasure is all yours.

01:17:04.288 --> 01:17:05.080
So, Archibald
aren't you proud of the marvelous use"

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:06.416
I've made of your knowledge?

01:17:06.457 --> 01:17:08.459
Looks like a fine structure...

01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:09.376
A shame it's only purpose...

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:12.130
is to flood the Minimoys!

01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:13.462
Oh, no, not only that..."

01:17:13.506 --> 01:17:14.757
we are going to drown them,

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.467
pulverize them, and destroy them forever.

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:20.427
They will die in agony
with my name upon their lips

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.930
Look... read my lips

01:17:22.973 --> 01:17:25.806
Mal-tha-zar

01:17:25.847 --> 01:17:27.183
You really are a monster!

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:29.646
Maybe... but I also know how to be noble!

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:31.228
You are free

01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:38.776
See?! All you have to do is follow this tunnel

01:17:38.816 --> 01:17:40.233
and you'll be home in no time!

01:17:40.274 --> 01:17:41.904
As soon as we're inside that tunnel
you'll flood it

01:17:41.945 --> 01:17:44.991
My poor Selenia
What a twisted mind you have! Come on

01:17:45.032 --> 01:17:46.907
hurry up, before I change my mind

01:17:46.948 --> 01:17:47.366
Sire?

01:17:47.408 --> 01:17:48.411
What is it now?

01:17:48.452 --> 01:17:51.747
May I ask You Highness to grant me
one last favor before I die

01:17:51.789 --> 01:17:53.624
I like this kid!

01:17:53.665 --> 01:17:54.543
what is this favor?

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.374
I would like to leave my only valued possession,

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.919
this bracelet, to my friend, Mino.

01:18:02.421 --> 01:18:03.339
Granted!

01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:07.009
Your father sent me! I'll get you out of here

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:10.220
But you need to signal your
position at noon precisely!

01:18:10.429 --> 01:18:11.848
Signal my position, but how?

01:18:11.889 --> 01:18:13.893
Using your mirrors, Mino, mirrors...!

01:18:13.927 --> 01:18:15.222
Oh? Yes! Mmm... mirrors!

01:18:15.305 --> 01:18:16.141
That's enough!

01:18:16.184 --> 01:18:18.853
Patience is the only thing for which
I set myself a limit...!

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.478
At noon... high noon, on the dot!

01:18:20.521 --> 01:18:23.730
I shall allow you a head start of... three minutes.

01:18:27.444 --> 01:18:29.235
I hope the burns in hell!

01:18:29.278 --> 01:18:31.280
He's already there, Selenia, hurry!

01:18:31.405 --> 01:18:32.405
Darkos?

01:18:32.449 --> 01:18:33.332
Yes, father?

01:18:33.367 --> 01:18:35.952
Prepare to open the floodgates

01:18:37.409 --> 01:18:39.329
Is there nothing to nibble?

01:18:40.829 --> 01:18:45.375
I do love something to nibble
on during a good show

01:18:46.419 --> 01:18:49.715
I can't go on...
and what's the point in running anyway?!

01:18:49.756 --> 01:18:51.131
Grandpa... come on, hurry

01:18:51.172 --> 01:18:53.173
You go on!
I'm staying here... to await my death...

01:18:53.216 --> 01:18:56.052
with a little dignity.

01:18:56.095 --> 01:18:57.844
Come on, Grandpa! You can do it

01:18:57.886 --> 01:19:00.096
Arthur! What's the point?
you must face up to it,

01:19:00.137 --> 01:19:01.682
son, we're done for.

01:19:03.892 --> 01:19:05.978
Your Highness, a few tasty tidbits

01:19:09.313 --> 01:19:13.608
Mmm, delicious! Bring me more!

01:19:13.858 --> 01:19:16.320
There must be a solution!
There's always a solution

01:19:16.402 --> 01:19:17.902
The only solution is to pray,"

01:19:17.937 --> 01:19:19.404
my children... pray for a miracle

01:19:19.438 --> 01:19:19.945
The problem is,"

01:19:19.987 --> 01:19:21.740
I've already asked the Great Goddess of
the Forest for so many miracles...

01:19:21.781 --> 01:19:23.448
I'm afraid she might get mad!

01:19:30.705 --> 01:19:31.454
A miracle!

01:19:31.497 --> 01:19:32.583
A miracle, where?!

01:19:32.626 --> 01:19:34.834
Right here, Grandpa, you're sitting on it.

01:19:34.877 --> 01:19:36.044
Look!

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:37.753
Come and give me a hand...!

01:19:39.506 --> 01:19:41.090
Come on... push!

01:19:41.632 --> 01:19:44.178
Oh

01:19:45.011 --> 01:19:46.137
What is this thing?

01:19:46.219 --> 01:19:49.350
It's a car.
It's a Ferrari 250 GTI 12-cylinder...!

01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:50.231
It's a birthday present!

01:19:50.266 --> 01:19:51.637
Don't tell me you know how to drive that thing?

01:19:51.679 --> 01:19:52.766
Of course I do!

01:19:52.806 --> 01:19:53.977
If the young lady would care to step this way

01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:55.518
Oh God, whatever!

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.940
Bingo!

01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:20.207
Hurry, Arthur, please get in!

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:21.249
If we want make it the whole way,"

01:20:21.334 --> 01:20:22.628
we have to wind it up as far as it will go.

01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:23.753
Arthur, the water is coming!

01:20:23.795 --> 01:20:25.255
Hurry, Arthur, please.

01:20:25.289 --> 01:20:25.922
Got it!

01:20:25.963 --> 01:20:28.130
this is the first time I've ever taken
a girl out for a drive, you know!

01:20:28.172 --> 01:20:30.298
Well, let's just hope it won't
be the last... Step on it!

01:20:30.506 --> 01:20:32.341
We're off!

01:20:34.471 --> 01:20:36.345
Faster!

01:20:41.186 --> 01:20:42.435
I just hope there aren't any speed
cameras down here,

01:20:42.476 --> 01:20:43.561
or we've had it!

01:20:43.602 --> 01:20:45.064
Hey, go to the left!

01:20:48.605 --> 01:20:51.778
I'd appreciate a little more warning
next time if that's OK with you?

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.401
OK, Turn right.

01:20:55.738 --> 01:20:57.198
Which way do I go now, left or right?

01:20:57.239 --> 01:20:58.490
Down!

01:21:02.036 --> 01:21:03.455
Selenia... I... I don't feel so good!

01:21:03.497 --> 01:21:06.369
Just hang in there, the road is smoother now.

01:21:15.673 --> 01:21:16.378
Arthur

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.216
Honey, do you hear that strange noise?"

01:21:18.258 --> 01:21:19.509
It sounds like
there's running water underneath.

01:21:19.551 --> 01:21:23.054
Oh great, now you're hearing voice
just like Joan of Arc did?"

01:21:23.095 --> 01:21:24.886
Next thing you know you're gonna
be seeing little angels

01:21:24.929 --> 01:21:29.307
and great big ghosts
with spears and armor coming after you

01:21:29.349 --> 01:21:31.142
Wait wait, you might want to turn around,"

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:34.396
there's, there's large men
with necklaces and feathers

01:21:35.230 --> 01:21:36.607
and I don't know... I...

01:21:37.442 --> 01:21:38.986
What the...

01:21:43.653 --> 01:21:44.487
What time is it?

01:21:44.528 --> 01:21:46.572
The time?! sure!

01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:48.072
According to our calculations,"

01:21:48.114 --> 01:21:50.952
the water should hit
the village in three balls time.

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.374
What time is it, my dear Miro?

01:21:53.415 --> 01:21:54.999
Five to noon, my good king.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.207
Only five minutes left and still...
no news.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:58.165
Have faith in them, my good king..."

01:21:58.207 --> 01:21:59.585
I am sure that they will succeed.

01:21:59.627 --> 01:22:02.959
May the Gods hear you
Miro, may the gods hear you...

01:22:13.013 --> 01:22:14.847
Look, there's the gate!

01:22:14.887 --> 01:22:15.600
Yes

01:22:15.808 --> 01:22:18.517
We made it!

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:24.188
Arthur
you're not going break down on us now?!

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:26.733
Sorry
I guess we're gonna have to get out and... RUN!

01:22:30.528 --> 01:22:32.195
What is that rumbling noise?

01:22:32.279 --> 01:22:34.948
I have no idea, Sire
but I have a terrible foreboding

01:22:35.447 --> 01:22:37.785
Father, it's me, Selenia!

01:22:37.826 --> 01:22:39.369
My daughter... they have returned!

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:42.037
Open the gate!

01:22:42.078 --> 01:22:44.121
Open the gate now!

01:22:50.337 --> 01:22:51.464
Close the gate immediately!

01:22:51.506 --> 01:22:53.425
Open it, close it, make up your mind

01:22:53.466 --> 01:22:55.591
All together now!

01:23:06.601 --> 01:23:08.317
You did it daddy, you did it!"

01:23:08.352 --> 01:23:11.688
You are now the uncontested Master
of all the Kingdoms!

01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:12.730
Heaven knows,"

01:23:12.773 --> 01:23:15.151
I don't care about titles and honors,

01:23:15.193 --> 01:23:18.735
but I must admit that it does feel good
to be Supreme Ruler.

01:23:18.777 --> 01:23:20.404
Let us prepare ourselves.

01:23:23.406 --> 01:23:24.991
The gate looks as if it will hold.

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:25.825
Not for long!

01:23:25.866 --> 01:23:26.368
It will!

01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.659
Oh, my children!

01:23:27.699 --> 01:23:27.950
Papa!

01:23:27.991 --> 01:23:29.079
Daddy!

01:23:30.121 --> 01:23:31.457
We missed you, Papa

01:23:31.497 --> 01:23:32.289
Oh, my children,"

01:23:32.332 --> 01:23:34.626
Oh, my children, you're this old king's
most prized possessions.

01:23:56.058 --> 01:23:57.059
What's wrong?

01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:01.564
No, the phone's cut off, it doesn't work.

01:24:01.606 --> 01:24:02.981
What is wrong?!

01:24:03.483 --> 01:24:05.070
AHHHH... Ou... out there!

01:24:05.112 --> 01:24:06.068
What's out there?

01:24:06.111 --> 01:24:06.737
Five!

01:24:06.778 --> 01:24:07.610
Five what?

01:24:07.651 --> 01:24:08.990
Blllllaaaaaack!

01:24:09.031 --> 01:24:10.658
What are you talking about?

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.698
Huge!
(panicky whispers, then, LOUD)

01:24:11.823 --> 01:24:12.656
Where're you going?"

01:24:12.699 --> 01:24:14.825
Don't leave me here,
no Granny please!

01:24:17.785 --> 01:24:20.123
it's noon!

01:24:20.915 --> 01:24:22.417
In one minute!

01:24:23.499 --> 01:24:26.004
Hurry now, you only have one minute.

01:24:26.045 --> 01:24:28.200
We can only hold the water back
for about an hour,

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.591
but I know that I can
depend on you.

01:24:30.133 --> 01:24:31.509
After all, you're one of us now,

01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:34.450
and I hope you know that
you're always welcome back here.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:38.000
And a second turn of
the wheel for the spirit.

01:24:38.905 --> 01:24:40.500
Our lives are in your hands, my friend.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.521
We're counting on you
and your grandson.

01:24:42.567 --> 01:24:45.228
Don't worry. Arthur has a plan,
and I'm sure it's gonna work.

01:24:48.599 --> 01:24:50.109
It's gonna be pretty dull
around here without you.

01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:50.942
Come back soon, huh?

01:24:50.984 --> 01:24:53.815
At the tenth moon, that's promise.

01:24:57.863 --> 01:25:00.491
Ten moons, that gives us plenty
of time to put our desire

01:25:00.533 --> 01:25:03.117
to the test and respect the protocol!

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.954
To hell with the protocol!

01:25:07.831 --> 01:25:10.500
and a third turn of the wheel for the soul.

01:25:28.099 --> 01:25:31.722
See you... ten moons!

01:25:37.851 --> 01:25:42.850
Thank you! You okay? Yeah, thanks!

01:25:42.891 --> 01:25:44.059
Mom?

01:25:44.101 --> 01:25:45.972
Mom...! Mom?

01:25:46.014 --> 01:25:48.931
Honey, what, get out... what...

01:25:51.717 --> 01:25:55.342
oh! Arthur! where have you been?

01:25:55.382 --> 01:25:56.256
I was with the Minimoys

01:25:56.298 --> 01:25:57.634
The Min... Miniwhat?

01:25:57.675 --> 01:25:59.007
The Minimoys!

01:25:59.049 --> 01:26:02.877
Oooh... Ha, ha!

01:26:02.919 --> 01:26:04.297
Mom?!

01:26:04.338 --> 01:26:05.585
Oh Granpa!

01:26:06.462 --> 01:26:07.960
Are you okay?

01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:11.457
My brothers!
Oh I'm so glad to see you again!

01:26:11.498 --> 01:26:17.414
Grandpa! We've got no time left
we gotta go!

01:26:17.455 --> 01:26:19.288
You're right

01:26:20.786 --> 01:26:23.116
Noon on the dot!

01:26:23.158 --> 01:26:25.156
and no one in sight!

01:26:25.197 --> 01:26:27.616
I'm afraid
though it is a beautiful Sunday

01:26:27.657 --> 01:26:29.320
despite it being the day of our Lord...

01:26:29.365 --> 01:26:32.904
there seems to be no miracle! So

01:26:34.238 --> 01:26:36.985
You're right Davido

01:26:37.028 --> 01:26:38.566
it is a beautiful, beautiful Sunday!

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.106
I believe we have some papers to sign

01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:41.151
am I right?

01:26:41.193 --> 01:26:42.106
Let's go in the living room,

01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:43.606
we'll be more comfortable!

01:26:48.977 --> 01:26:50.224
While I try to buy time,

01:26:50.266 --> 01:26:51.145
you get busy finding the treasure

01:26:51.188 --> 01:26:52.308
OK!

01:27:00.013 --> 01:27:05.300
Mino, Mino where are you? Mino!

01:27:05.341 --> 01:27:07.925
This is not gonna be easy!

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:14.046
Light!

01:27:36.533 --> 01:27:39.197
I promised you riches and power

01:27:39.241 --> 01:27:42.157
And Malthazar always keeps his promises.

01:27:42.199 --> 01:27:44.155
nothing can stop us now!

01:27:44.197 --> 01:27:47.195
The Seven Kingdoms are... mine!

01:27:49.068 --> 01:27:50.900
I mean, of course, ours

01:27:54.816 --> 01:27:56.190
What?

01:27:56.232 --> 01:27:57.358
Excuse me,

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:58.483
could you tell me what time it is,

01:27:58.522 --> 01:28:00.230
I'm kinda far-sighted

01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:02.896
NOON!

01:28:02.939 --> 01:28:03.976
Thank you!

01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:06.308
My fearless and faithful warriors!

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:08.975
...let the festivities begin.

01:28:13.472 --> 01:28:15.095
Now if I do the exact opposite,

01:28:15.135 --> 01:28:18.051
the light which reflects downwards should
then reflect... upwards!

01:28:26.252 --> 01:28:28.380
Mino! You're the best.

01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:32.551
But what is he doing? Darkos!?

01:28:32.585 --> 01:28:34.251
That idiot will give our position away!

01:28:34.293 --> 01:28:35.873
Make him cut that beam immediately!

01:28:36.375 --> 01:28:37.748
Cut the beam!

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:39.791
Huh? Uh, sorry, because I'm far sighted,

01:28:39.832 --> 01:28:40.756
but I'm also hard of hearing!

01:28:40.792 --> 01:28:45.829
You fool! You will be sorry
that you defied Malthazar!

01:28:51.241 --> 01:28:52.365
Oh, it's nothing, really!

01:28:52.575 --> 01:28:53.783
Bring him here!

01:28:53.825 --> 01:28:56.216
Watch out! I can get really nasty!

01:28:56.251 --> 01:28:58.614
Sure you can... come on, show us!

01:29:15.185 --> 01:29:16.726
WHAT IS THIS THING?

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:20.805
I know, I know... Oh gracious Lord
it's a kind of

01:29:41.628 --> 01:29:42.710
Damn!

01:29:42.752 --> 01:29:48.251
Father! What shall I do?
What about me, father?

01:29:53.667 --> 01:29:56.789
As for you, my son...

01:29:56.831 --> 01:30:00.368
I hereby solemnly appoint you Commander
of the Imperial Forces!

01:30:00.741 --> 01:30:02.332
Oh... thank you, father, that's nice

01:30:02.367 --> 01:30:03.911
but... you wouldn't have a place left
on that mosquito of yours,

01:30:03.993 --> 01:30:04.740
would you?!

01:30:04.782 --> 01:30:07.157
A Commander never deserts his post...!

01:30:09.699 --> 01:30:13.276
Father... Daddy!?

01:30:18.024 --> 01:30:25.937
Mino? Yes!

01:30:30.603 --> 01:30:32.225
More coffee?

01:30:32.269 --> 01:30:34.391
No! No more coffee! Thank you!

01:30:34.433 --> 01:30:36.681
But what I would love is
for you to sign the paper!

01:30:36.722 --> 01:30:39.221
Of course, what did I do with my pen?

01:30:41.596 --> 01:30:43.093
Oh what a lovely pen!

01:30:43.135 --> 01:30:44.551
We have wasted enough time.

01:30:44.594 --> 01:30:45.557
Sign!

01:30:45.592 --> 01:30:46.676
Of course.

01:30:52.424 --> 01:30:56.338
And now... the money!

01:30:56.379 --> 01:31:00.128
Hm? Oh the money, yes!

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:02.251
I'd like to see how you're going to
pull one of your tricks now!

01:31:02.285 --> 01:31:03.622
Here!

01:31:05.665 --> 01:31:07.331
Bravo my boy!

01:31:12.996 --> 01:31:19.948
So then... good accounts make
for good friends isn't that right?

01:31:20.407 --> 01:31:23.696
There you are, paid in full!

01:31:29.068 --> 01:31:32.110
Sir, I must now be saying goodbye!

01:31:32.150 --> 01:31:33.275
Good bye now.

01:31:33.316 --> 01:31:35.397
Good bye!

01:31:45.019 --> 01:31:46.297
Congratulations!

01:31:47.328 --> 01:31:48.441
Nobody move!

01:31:48.482 --> 01:31:50.215
I said!

01:31:56.772 --> 01:31:59.368
So that's why you
had your sights set on this land?

01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:02.589
Of course! The call of greed
now and forever!

01:32:02.621 --> 01:32:03.952
One night you had a few too many,

01:32:03.992 --> 01:32:05.560
and you told me about this treasure,

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:07.872
and ever since
I have not had a good night's sleep!

01:32:07.913 --> 01:32:09.767
But now, it's mine!

01:32:09.807 --> 01:32:12.158
Thanks kid! Nice job!

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.932
Well, I'll be saying my farewells,

01:32:13.969 --> 01:32:15.668
you won't be seeing me ever again!

01:32:15.708 --> 01:32:19.911
Because, I am going far, far away!

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:23.749
You're coming with me! Com'on!

01:32:24.245 --> 01:32:26.678
Get your hands off me.
I know the governor!

01:32:31.186 --> 01:32:32.860
I'll take that. I'll take that.

01:32:32.902 --> 01:32:35.205
Next time,
please, put your gift in a safer place.

01:32:35.247 --> 01:32:35.960
That's a promise.

01:32:36.002 --> 01:32:39.265
I'll take it.
It's much safer with me.

01:33:01.157 --> 01:33:02.623
Don't worry Mino,

01:33:02.665 --> 01:33:04.383
I'm gonna care of you.

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:14.383
They did it!

01:33:14.802 --> 01:33:19.100
Yes, he made it, made it!
My son!

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.000
Oh, my boy...

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.035
Howl would have loved
my little Mino to see this!

01:33:29.078 --> 01:33:30.663
I understand Miro,

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:32.463
but our people are safe and sound...

01:33:32.548 --> 01:33:34.599
and that is something to be
thankful for.

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.189
Of course. of course.

01:33:43.770 --> 01:33:46.817
Wait, I think I know what it is

01:33:49.249 --> 01:33:50.797
Hey, it's Mino!

01:33:50.923 --> 01:33:52.638
Mino, my son!

01:33:52.783 --> 01:33:57.000
- Papa!
- Oh, my boy...

01:33:58.458 --> 01:33:59.294
Well, there you go!

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.180
All's well that ends well!

01:34:01.271 --> 01:34:02.266
Not quite...

01:34:05.154 --> 01:34:05.781
May I?

01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:45.213
I think it's ready... Excuse me...

01:34:45.253 --> 01:34:48.015
Waited so long for this moment.

01:34:52.914 --> 01:34:55.130
I propose a toast!

01:34:55.172 --> 01:34:57.142
Here, here!

01:34:57.183 --> 01:34:58.647
Here it comes!

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:01.949
What's that?

01:35:01.992 --> 01:35:03.127
My favorite dish!

01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:05.093
African giraffe's neck!

01:35:05.137 --> 01:35:06.097
What?

01:35:10.035 --> 01:35:13.085
Honey! Honey! Rosie!

01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:14.344
Wake up, honey!

01:35:15.513 --> 01:35:18.278
Every time she gets a little excited
over she goes!

01:35:21.079 --> 01:35:22.586
Where's Arthur?

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.520
He, he just went to wash up.

01:35:25.559 --> 01:35:26.815
He'll be back in a jiffy!

01:35:42.177 --> 01:35:45.317
only ten more moons, Selenia

01:36:00.718 --> 01:36:02.016
I will wait for you.
