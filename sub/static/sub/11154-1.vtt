00:18.573 --> 00:22.771
Now, remember, if your loop is
large, your rug is loose.

00:22.853 --> 00:24.764
Let's all repeat that, shall we?

00:24.853 --> 00:29.085
If your loop is large, your rug is loose.

00:29.173 --> 00:31.368
Good. Now let's give it a try.

00:31.453 --> 00:38.131
Make a loop, pull it through,
cross over and pull it out.

00:38.213 --> 00:41.603
Tighten those loops, Mr Lefkowitz.

00:52.413 --> 00:56.406
This rest-home.
You wouldn't believe the place.

00:56.493 --> 00:59.087
"Lights on!" "Lights off!"

00:59.173 --> 01:01.607
Rules, rules, rules.

01:01.693 --> 01:04.081
They don't even let you
keep a hotplate.

01:06.133 --> 01:10.649
I shouldn't complain.
Today was an exciting day.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.884
I learned how to hook a rug.

01:13.973 --> 01:19.206
A man who, at one time, had the entire
garment district right here.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.967
That's how I spend my days.

01:24.373 --> 01:26.364
It isn't fair.

01:30.413 --> 01:37.125
You work all your life, and you pay
taxes, you're a good citizen.

01:37.213 --> 01:39.363
And what are you left with?

01:39.453 --> 01:41.648
A tight rug.

01:45.293 --> 01:47.807
I miss you, Rose.

01:48.533 --> 01:53.812
My glass-bottom boat is about to give
you a treat, so hold on to your lanyards.

01:53.893 --> 02:00.332
What you have before you, ladies and
gentlemen, is the climax of today's adventure.

02:00.413 --> 02:04.884
The famous Lost Treasure of
the Florida Keys.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.721
Amazing, isn't it?

02:09.812 --> 02:14.284
Oh, good people, it's been here since the days
of Ponce de Leon and Vasco da Gama.

02:14.373 --> 02:18.412
- Even Moby Dick.
- What a rip-off.

02:19.533 --> 02:22.331
If there are no questions,
we'll head back to port,

02:22.413 --> 02:28.886
where our gift kiosk carries an attractive line
of postcards, T-shirts and other treasures.

02:28.973 --> 02:31.043
Full steam ahead, matey!

02:34.093 --> 02:36.004
Shiver me timbers!

02:51.013 --> 02:54.722
<i>Stop! What the hell are you doin'?
Them's my French fries.</i>

02:54.813 --> 02:57.122
<i>Oh, Mamma!</i>

02:57.493 --> 03:01.930
- Hi, honey. I'm home.
- Hi, Mom.

03:02.013 --> 03:04.481
- How's the term paper coming?
- Fine.

03:08.653 --> 03:11.963
David, I hope that's not the TV I hear.

03:12.053 --> 03:14.044
No, Mom.

03:42.453 --> 03:44.171
<i>David?</i>

03:44.253 --> 03:48.485
- Who's there?
- It's your grandpa. I gotta talk to you.

03:48.573 --> 03:52.122
<i>- Grandpa!
- Your grandma and I are coming to see you.</i>

03:52.213 --> 03:55.762
<i>- Really?
- Our friends have unfinished business to do.</i>

03:55.853 --> 03:58.651
<i>It was a chance
for your grandma and I to grab a ride.</i>

03:58.733 --> 04:02.362
<i>You have to talk to your mother
because she won't be ready for this.</i>

04:02.453 --> 04:04.603
What do I say? She's gonna freak.

04:04.693 --> 04:07.890
<i>Just tell her the truth. How about that?</i>

04:07.973 --> 04:11.170
<i>- Look, I'll see you soon, son.
- Great!</i>

05:22.493 --> 05:26.645
I know how much you love Grandpa and
Grandma and wish they were here with us,

05:26.733 --> 05:29.008
so it's only normal to fantasize.

05:29.093 --> 05:34.042
- But it's important to know it's only a fantasy.
- But it's not a fantasy.

05:34.133 --> 05:37.330
Maybe it would help
if you talked to somebody about this.

05:37.413 --> 05:42.407
Mom, I don't need to see a shrink. They're
not dead. They really did go to another planet.

05:42.493 --> 05:46.964
- David, your grandparents are not in space.

05:47.053 --> 05:50.204
They're not in the television
and they're not coming back.

05:50.293 --> 05:53.410
They were lost at sea. You know that.

05:53.493 --> 05:56.246
They've been dead for five years.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.842
Hello, darling.

06:04.693 --> 06:06.490
Oh...

06:11.013 --> 06:13.004
Just a minute!

06:19.733 --> 06:22.088
Well, aren't you gonna invite us in?

06:23.573 --> 06:25.643
Oh, for crying out loud!

06:25.733 --> 06:27.928
Joe! Joe!

06:28.013 --> 06:29.685
Alma!

06:29.773 --> 06:31.570
Bess! How are ya?

06:31.653 --> 06:34.929
Art! Come in, Art!
It's so wonderful to see you.

06:35.013 --> 06:37.811
- It's great to see you, boy.
- What's to see?

06:37.893 --> 06:43.365
I'm a broken-down old schlep with one foot
in the grave. If I was a horse, they'd shoot me.

06:43.453 --> 06:46.570
The same old Bernie.

06:46.653 --> 06:51.932
You haven't aged a day. You probably think
I'm ajerk for not going with you.

06:52.013 --> 06:54.686
Oh, Bernie, we never thought that.

06:54.773 --> 07:00.530
Good, because I never regretted it.
I never once regretted not going with you.

07:01.533 --> 07:03.763
What's that? A little remodelling?

07:03.853 --> 07:07.766
Oh, the maintenance here is...
You wouldn't believe it...

07:07.853 --> 07:10.845
I ought to sue. I think it's...

07:10.933 --> 07:14.642
By the way, you owe me rent.

07:20.253 --> 07:22.926
It's all yours. All your things.

07:23.013 --> 07:28.087
They tried to throw them out after you left,
but I told them "Over my dead body."

07:28.173 --> 07:33.327
- I guess they figured that wouldn't be long.
- Bernie, you're a sentimental fool.

07:33.413 --> 07:39.886
Well, I'm glad you got here in time because
I've been thinking about a garage sale.

07:39.973 --> 07:43.045
<i>How have you really been?</i>

07:43.133 --> 07:46.330
The truth? Not too good.

07:46.413 --> 07:49.928
But now maybe things are looking up.

07:50.013 --> 07:52.481
I think it's gonna be like old times.

07:54.253 --> 07:55.971
I think.

07:56.053 --> 07:58.248
Huh?

07:59.493 --> 08:02.963
I feel terrible.
We let him think we were staying.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.692
Do you want to be the one
to burst his bubble?

08:05.773 --> 08:10.972
So what do we do?
Let him think we're staying here for good?

08:11.053 --> 08:14.966
- We're gonna have to tell him sooner or later.
- Hold it.

08:15.053 --> 08:17.408
I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

08:17.493 --> 08:21.168
But not until I think he can handle it. Right?

08:26.773 --> 08:30.209
Good morning, my little Antarean butterfly.

08:31.373 --> 08:35.082
- Smells like I'll gain 5lbs this morning.
- At least.

08:35.173 --> 08:38.245
- How you feel?
- Finer than frog hair.

08:41.413 --> 08:44.291
- Where is everybody?
- The first group went through.

08:44.373 --> 08:47.843
Here, have some coffee.
I made a fresh pot.

08:50.093 --> 08:55.963
- How's Susie this morning?
- All things considered, holding up very well.

08:56.053 --> 08:58.362
It's good to be back, isn't it?

08:58.453 --> 09:00.250
Yeah.

09:05.613 --> 09:10.812
- Still got the moves, don't I, kid?
- I didn't marry you for your money!

09:10.893 --> 09:12.690
Well, I'll be goddamned.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.722
- What is it?
- Here.

09:17.053 --> 09:19.044
I'll be right back.

09:42.453 --> 09:44.444
Look at this!

09:48.813 --> 09:50.804
Is this beautiful?

09:52.013 --> 09:54.208
You are beautiful.

09:58.613 --> 10:01.571
- You have incredible eyes. You a collector?
- No.

10:01.653 --> 10:03.769
Oh, a shrewd one at that.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.242
Well, I will not insult you by haggling.

10:06.333 --> 10:12.090
This Davy Jones treasure chest - a beauty,
isn't it? - I can give it to you for $19.95.

10:12.173 --> 10:14.243
For that piece ofjunk?

10:14.333 --> 10:17.723
You wife doesn't appreciate
fine antiques the way you do.

10:17.813 --> 10:22.728
Listen, you take the box and I'll throw in
the barnacle salt-and-pepper shakers for free.

10:22.813 --> 10:24.804
- Sold.
- Ha-ha!

10:26.653 --> 10:29.087
Lovely.

10:51.893 --> 10:54.453
Shaun, uh...

10:54.533 --> 10:57.411
Take care of those folks, will you?

11:09.773 --> 11:11.252
Hello, Jack.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.404
I don't believe it.

11:17.053 --> 11:19.044
What are you doin' here?

11:19.133 --> 11:25.242
Don't tell me. You searched the entire galaxy,
couldn't find anyone as terrific as me?

11:25.333 --> 11:27.722
The cocoons are in danger, Jack.

11:27.813 --> 11:33.012
The sensors that we left on the bottom
of the ocean floor indicate seismic activity.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.129
We've come to take our friends away.

11:35.213 --> 11:39.889
We've got four days to rescue them
before our ship returns to take us home.

11:39.973 --> 11:41.964
Seismic activity? That's heavy.

11:42.053 --> 11:44.965
I was in an earthquake,
so I know it's very intense.

11:45.053 --> 11:47.044
Well, aren't you glad to see me?

11:47.133 --> 11:51.331
Isn't it a custom here to hug a friend
when you haven't seen her in a long time?

11:51.413 --> 11:54.052
Yeah... Yeah, of course.

11:57.573 --> 11:59.006
Hey, Romeo!

11:59.093 --> 12:05.282
D'you think you could tear yourself away long
enough to ring up my clamshell castanets?

12:34.053 --> 12:39.446
"O my luve is like a red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June:"

12:39.533 --> 12:45.722
"O my luve is like a melodie
That is sweetly play'd in tune."

12:47.013 --> 12:50.005
Oh, Arthur, darling, it's perfect.

12:50.853 --> 12:55.563
- D'you want me to fix us breakfast?
- No time. Gotta meet the boys and get Bernie.

12:56.293 --> 12:58.682
- Poor Bernie.
- Oh, nonsense.

12:58.773 --> 13:02.049
We'll get him out of that hospital
and get his blood pumping again.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.124
- That's Joe.

13:04.213 --> 13:07.410
- Will you miss me?
- I already do.

13:08.453 --> 13:10.444
Goodbye, Mrs Selwyn.

13:15.573 --> 13:19.725
- How'd ya sleep?
- Best night's sleep I've had in years.

13:19.813 --> 13:22.930
- How about Bess?
- She slept like a baby.

13:23.013 --> 13:26.767
- What about you two?
- Alma didn't sleep a wink.

13:26.853 --> 13:29.413
- You're kidding?
- No.

13:29.493 --> 13:31.290
Neither did I.

13:31.373 --> 13:33.568
Oh, you dog, you!

13:39.813 --> 13:41.644
You smell that?

13:41.733 --> 13:43.724
Yeah, incense.

13:43.813 --> 13:46.202
Maybe a Hindu runs the place.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.444
Back here.

13:54.013 --> 13:56.846
Come on back, whoever you are.

13:56.933 --> 14:00.323
Believe it or not, I'm open for business!

14:04.973 --> 14:07.533
Hiya, fellas. What can I do for you?

14:07.613 --> 14:10.127
- Mrs Feinberg?
- Call me Ruby.

14:10.213 --> 14:15.446
Ever try this? It delivers oxygen-enriched
blood to the pleasure centres of the brain.

14:15.533 --> 14:20.732
It's terrific. Will you give me a hand? I'm new
at this. It's tough getting out of this cookie.

14:20.813 --> 14:24.283
Here we go, OK? Come on, don't be shy.

14:24.373 --> 14:27.968
Now, put me right side up. Right side up.

14:28.053 --> 14:31.728
Easy! Take it easy, fellas. Easy. Easy.

14:31.813 --> 14:35.408
That is great. That's it. That's it.

14:35.493 --> 14:39.884
OK, now, you grab an ankle
and you grab an ankle.

14:39.973 --> 14:41.884
There's the left one. Terrific.

14:41.973 --> 14:45.204
That is it.

14:45.293 --> 14:47.090
Great.

14:47.173 --> 14:52.122
Oh, boy, that's terrific.
I feel sensational. Thanks a lot.

14:52.213 --> 14:54.443
Nice little place you got here... uh, Ruby.

14:54.533 --> 14:57.889
D'you hear that, Sidney?
It's a nice little place I got here.

14:57.973 --> 15:00.771
Sidney was my husband.
This dump was his dream.

15:00.853 --> 15:04.368
Unfortunately, the son of a bitch died
and left me to live it.

15:04.453 --> 15:09.766
- That's tough.
- Nah, it's not so bad. I just like to yak.

15:09.853 --> 15:12.526
Now, tell me. You two on vacation or what?

15:12.613 --> 15:14.046
- We, uh...
- Well...

15:14.133 --> 15:16.806
...came down to see old friends.
- Oh.

15:16.893 --> 15:20.169
Your night clerk told us to talk to you
about staying the week.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.041
Sure thing. No problem.
This is not exactly my busy season.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.203
- Great.

15:26.933 --> 15:29.891
There's Ben. We better get cracking.

15:29.973 --> 15:32.965
- See you round, Ruby.
- Count on it.

15:35.693 --> 15:40.642
Oh, hey! Will you get a load of this sunshine?
I feel like a teenager.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.405
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.

15:42.493 --> 15:45.087
- Last one to the car buys dinner.
- Hey, yeah!

15:45.173 --> 15:48.370
- Come on, slowpoke!
- You got a head start.

15:48.453 --> 15:50.648
Where are you, boy?

15:57.213 --> 15:58.612
Yahoo!

15:58.693 --> 16:01.287
Hey, not bad, Superman!

16:06.813 --> 16:11.045
We'll have to stop at a pharmacy.
If I don't have zinc oxide, I'll burn to a crisp.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.010
So we'll stop at a pharmacy.

16:13.093 --> 16:16.881
- Did you bring juice? I'll get dehydrated.
- We'll getjuice.

16:16.973 --> 16:19.533
- Bernie, where you going?
- None of your business.

16:19.613 --> 16:23.526
- You should be in your rug-hooking class.
- Take your hands off him.

16:23.613 --> 16:26.081
- Or what?
- Or you'll be sorry.

16:26.173 --> 16:30.086
- I said let him go!
- Out of my way, you old coot.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.561
Easy, Rambo.

16:35.653 --> 16:38.565
- What do you say we blow this joint?
- Yes.

16:40.413 --> 16:42.688
After you.

16:52.653 --> 16:54.689
Hey, hey!

16:54.773 --> 16:57.606
- Look at that.
- Come on!

16:57.693 --> 17:01.083
- Here we go.
- Last one in's a pantywaist!

17:01.173 --> 17:04.244
Last one in ain't got a hair on his ass!

17:08.733 --> 17:10.723
Here we go!

17:28.012 --> 17:30.004
Where is everybody?

17:47.133 --> 17:50.569
- How's the water?
- Great. It was just great.

17:50.653 --> 17:56.410
A beautiful beach, a sunny day and
good friends... what more can a man ask for?

17:58.653 --> 18:01.042
Can I have some of that, please?

18:01.133 --> 18:03.806
Wonderful. Would you look at them move?

18:03.893 --> 18:09.365
Gentlemen, I'd say all that those ladies
are lacking is a little mature male company.

18:09.453 --> 18:11.762
- Yeah.
- How about that?

18:11.853 --> 18:16.131
I think you're right.
Come on, Bernie. Come and dip your wick.

18:16.213 --> 18:18.204
Come on!

18:49.933 --> 18:54.085
Joe, I've gotta go. I've got an appointment.

18:54.173 --> 18:57.210
An appointment?
We're playing a game here, Bernie.

18:57.293 --> 18:59.284
It's important.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.727
OK, Bernie. I'll get the guys.

19:03.813 --> 19:05.804
Art. Ben.

19:25.253 --> 19:27.244
- How's this feel?
- Perfect.

19:27.333 --> 19:31.770
You're a good friend, Jack.
I knew we could count on you to help us out.

19:31.853 --> 19:35.528
It's no sweat. You're my favourite Martian.

19:36.653 --> 19:40.532
Well, I guess we're ready
and we'll be back in about an hour's time.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.092
Yeah. OK.

19:43.533 --> 19:46.969
- "My favourite Martian." That's good.
- See, he gets it.

21:19.453 --> 21:23.765
"St Petersburg Oceanographic Institute."
They got a cocoon.

21:25.613 --> 21:27.604
Holy shit.

21:30.253 --> 21:34.166
OK, David, one more swing.
I know you can do it, buddy. Come on.

21:34.773 --> 21:38.049
Hit it, man. Come on, David, one more time.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.567
Oh, man, too bad.

21:40.653 --> 21:45.363
- Next.
- That's OK, David. It's only batting practice.

21:45.453 --> 21:48.525
Come on, Tom, you're up. Take a cut.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.924
Screwed up again, guy.

23:28.813 --> 23:32.362
No matter how many times I see that,
it's still impressive.

23:56.933 --> 24:02.132
What's the mystery? You were analysing the
effects of quakes on fish and find a meteorite.

24:02.213 --> 24:07.367
When a meteor enters the atmosphere, the
pressure will leave characteristic markings.

24:07.453 --> 24:11.765
This baby doesn't have 'em.
Whatever it is, it didn't fall from the sky.

24:11.853 --> 24:15.766
It's weird-looking.
It's kind of like a dinosaur egg.

24:16.253 --> 24:21.043
What do you think, Sara?
You subscribe to the dinosaur-egg theory?

24:24.533 --> 24:26.524
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

24:31.893 --> 24:34.453
It's a life form.

24:46.413 --> 24:49.723
I'm gonna get a hot dog
and an ice-cold beer. How about you?

24:49.813 --> 24:52.805
- Sure, I'll have a beer.
- You get a milk shake.

24:52.893 --> 24:54.565
In you go.

24:54.653 --> 24:59.124
- Hey, look, it's Wade Boggs.
- How's it hanging, doofus?

24:59.213 --> 25:01.568
Yeah, that guy can't hit worth shit.

25:01.653 --> 25:04.042
Wanna let me in on that?

25:09.173 --> 25:12.370
I read somewhere, I don't know where,
maybe Ted Williams.

25:12.453 --> 25:19.484
It said the hardest thing in sports to do
is hit a round ball with a round bat.

25:19.573 --> 25:25.284
What you gotta do is learn how to hit the ball
with some degree of control.

25:25.373 --> 25:28.490
You go over by the bucket
and I'm gonna hit some of these.

25:28.573 --> 25:32.361
Now, watch. I'm gonna try
to see the ball hit the bat.

25:35.373 --> 25:40.163
Boom. See? And you don't
have to swing hard. Give me a ball.

25:41.893 --> 25:45.772
- OK.
- Now you. OK, come over here.

25:45.853 --> 25:49.448
Now, think. Try and see the ball hit the bat.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.482
All right, now you're cooking. All right.

25:55.573 --> 25:58.087
Let's go, let's go, let's go. A little pep.

26:00.093 --> 26:01.572
That's the one.

26:09.533 --> 26:14.482
- You ought to have your head examined.
- It was just a little baseball... Here, over here.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.690
Just a little ball game. No big deal.

26:17.773 --> 26:20.446
This is Earth, Ben, not Antarea.

26:20.533 --> 26:25.004
- As long as we're here, we keep getting older.
- I know.

26:26.293 --> 26:31.083
But with this kind of fringe benefit,
maybe it's worth it.

26:35.573 --> 26:38.849
Hey, what's going on?

26:38.933 --> 26:44.929
Well, it's been so long since you needed me
for anything like this, I guess I missed it.

26:46.333 --> 26:49.723
Yeah. I missed it, too.

26:50.573 --> 26:52.564
I know.

27:22.893 --> 27:25.282
It's not your fault.

27:25.373 --> 27:30.401
How could you know an earthquake would
knock a cocoon out of its hiding place, huh?

27:30.493 --> 27:34.691
I'm responsible for him. They're
counting on me to bring him back home.

27:34.773 --> 27:38.766
And I'm going to need a blueprint
of the institute so I can plan his rescue.

27:38.853 --> 27:41.572
Well, I'll help you. I'll do whatever you want.

27:41.653 --> 27:45.362
But I got into trouble last time,
so you cannot steal any more old people.

27:45.453 --> 27:49.651
- We're not doing that.
- All right, fine. Let's just go bust him out.

27:49.733 --> 27:54.249
It's not that easy. We can't free him without
the risk of drawing attention to ourselves.

27:54.333 --> 27:57.405
We'll go back in three days,
then rendezvous with the ship.

27:57.493 --> 28:00.291
Three days!

28:00.373 --> 28:06.642
You're crazy! Kitty, in three days they'll cut it
open and perform grotesque experiments...

28:06.733 --> 28:09.008
I'm sorry... I didn't mean...

28:09.093 --> 28:11.243
I'm sorry.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.324
I'm... I'm...

28:15.653 --> 28:18.247
We're going to get him back.

28:46.973 --> 28:49.612
Look at this. Slick as a whistle.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.968
You're not so bad yourself.

28:54.773 --> 28:58.482
Joe, I'm in heaven. Isn't this wonderful?

28:58.573 --> 29:01.406
You're the one who didn't wanna come back.

29:01.493 --> 29:05.771
- You glad I twisted your arm?
- I think I was afraid it wouldn't be the same.

29:05.853 --> 29:07.844
But it's better.

29:11.533 --> 29:14.206
- Look. What are we gonna do about him?

29:14.293 --> 29:19.208
- I asked him to dance.
- Forget it. Bernie hasn't cut a rug in 30 years.

29:19.293 --> 29:22.569
Joe, maybe we should
go and keep him company.

29:22.653 --> 29:27.249
I see something
that'll get his juices flowing.

29:45.133 --> 29:49.331
One more of these
and I am no longer responsible.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.722
- Waiter! Waiter!
- Oh!

29:52.773 --> 29:54.968
You are my kind of group.

29:55.053 --> 30:00.047
Most people our age are a pain in the ass.

30:02.613 --> 30:04.649
Most people our age are dead.

30:04.733 --> 30:06.724
Oh, Bernie.

30:06.813 --> 30:09.202
Where did he get to be so funny?

30:09.293 --> 30:14.003
- Yeah, Bernie, how'd you get to be so funny?
- I always thought Bernie was funny.

30:14.093 --> 30:16.368
- Me, too.
- You have?

30:16.453 --> 30:20.241
Oh, you don't think I'm funny, Joe?
Watch this. I'll show you funny.

30:20.333 --> 30:23.530
Presenting Mr Laurel and Mr Hardy.

30:38.573 --> 30:43.442
This is an eagle who just found out
his teenage daughter's pregnant.

30:52.533 --> 30:56.412
You know what? You are adorable.

31:01.253 --> 31:05.451
What's... Are you all right?
What's the matter? It was just a little kiss.

31:05.533 --> 31:08.366
I'm a married man.

31:08.453 --> 31:12.366
Oh, pardon me. I'm so sorry.

31:12.453 --> 31:15.251
- Your friends told me you were available.
- What?!

31:15.333 --> 31:18.484
- Bernie, we just thought...
- You just thought what, Joe?

31:18.573 --> 31:22.486
That I've forgotten about Rose?
That her memory means nothing to me?

31:22.573 --> 31:26.088
Well, I got news for you. It means everything.

31:26.173 --> 31:31.645
Now, don't break up your little party
on my account. I'll get a cab.

31:34.173 --> 31:37.404
He's a fun guy. A barrel of laughs.

31:37.493 --> 31:39.484
Thanks for the intro.

31:39.573 --> 31:42.963
- I'm sorry, Ruby.
- Yeah, forget it.

31:43.053 --> 31:45.613
Like I said...

31:45.693 --> 31:46.887
we had some laughs.

31:46.973 --> 31:51.046
Ruby, underneath it all
he really is a wonderful guy.

31:51.133 --> 31:52.930
Yeah, yeah.

31:53.013 --> 31:55.004
Thanks for the drink.

32:00.573 --> 32:04.851
Pay attention to the teacher.
Behave yourself.

32:04.933 --> 32:07.288
Michael, stop pushing.

32:14.853 --> 32:18.129
Kelly, why'd you fall from there?
I told you so many times.

32:18.213 --> 32:20.044
Sh, it's not gonna hurt.

32:20.133 --> 32:22.328
Hi. Is it bad?

32:22.413 --> 32:27.328
I don't think so, but I'd like to have someone
look at it. She banged her head pretty hard.

32:27.413 --> 32:31.486
Oh, poor little girl. Now, that's a bad bump.

32:31.573 --> 32:34.041
Let me see if I can take it away.

32:35.413 --> 32:38.132
I got it! Let's throw it away.

32:38.213 --> 32:40.363
Wow. You've got the touch.

32:40.453 --> 32:47.211
The first-aid station's over there. Would you
mind watching the kids for a few minutes?

32:47.293 --> 32:51.047
- OK. You go take care of her.
- Oh, thanks.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.203
Just blow this if they attack.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.810
All right, children. Gather round.

33:13.053 --> 33:16.363
Well, well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

33:19.533 --> 33:25.210
- Your pals said to tell you they'd be a bit late.
- Fine. I'll wait outside.

33:25.293 --> 33:27.682
Don't be silly. Take the load off your feet.

33:30.893 --> 33:33.248
I don't bite, you know.

33:33.813 --> 33:37.806
- I'll just stand here, by the door.
- OK, suit yourself.

33:41.173 --> 33:43.164
Listen, um...

33:46.453 --> 33:49.206
I'm sorry about last night, OK?

33:49.293 --> 33:52.444
- Forget about it.
- No, I don't think so.

33:52.533 --> 33:54.922
I don't like loose ends.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.926
Maybe we could, um, smooth things out.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.565
Over a cocktail?

34:03.653 --> 34:07.441
That's not necessary.
I accept your apology.

34:10.333 --> 34:13.768
- You're afraid of me, aren't you?
- I certainly am not.

34:13.853 --> 34:16.242
OK. Then there's no problem.

34:18.933 --> 34:21.606
Pick you up at seven.

34:26.493 --> 34:30.964
So finally, after the longest trip
you could ever imagine,

34:31.053 --> 34:35.649
their spaceship landed and
it was time for them to see their new home.

34:35.733 --> 34:41.842
The spaceship's door slowly opened
and there before them was the magic planet...

34:41.933 --> 34:45.891
the most beautiful sight
any of them had ever seen.

34:45.973 --> 34:53.049
The sky was gold, and shining down on them
were three pale, pale pink moons.

34:53.132 --> 34:58.048
So they stepped outside, and guess what?

34:58.133 --> 35:01.045
- What?
- They floated.

35:01.133 --> 35:04.409
That's right!
They could fly like birds.

35:04.493 --> 35:08.202
So they all joined hands and,
with their new friends leading the way,

35:08.293 --> 35:14.129
they flew off to a silver city
shimmering in the distance.

35:14.213 --> 35:19.128
- Can we go there?
- Hold on, now. It's very far.

35:19.213 --> 35:23.525
And, besides, if you left here
think of all the things you'd miss.

35:23.613 --> 35:27.162
- Do they have ice cream?
- No.

35:27.253 --> 35:31.166
- Santa Claus go there?
- I'm afraid it's too far for Santa to make it.

35:31.253 --> 35:33.892
Then how come the people went there?

35:33.973 --> 35:40.970
Well, on that planet no one ever gets sick,
no one ever gets old and no one ever dies.

35:41.053 --> 35:46.127
So if you're in love with someone,
you never have to lose them.

35:46.213 --> 35:51.287
What happens if
you fall in love with ice cream?

35:51.373 --> 35:53.364
You're in trouble!

35:57.013 --> 35:59.573
- I like that one!
- You do?

36:01.933 --> 36:04.322
Here we go, fellas. Stake your claim.

36:04.413 --> 36:09.441
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Is that a hot dog, or what?
- State of the art.

36:09.533 --> 36:13.321
- You know what they put in those things?
- I do. Thanks for reminding me.

36:13.413 --> 36:16.405
Have a bite, Bernie.
They say the chilli kills the bugs.

36:16.493 --> 36:19.405
Very funny. Give me gas for a week.

36:20.413 --> 36:25.806
You know, Bernie? You'd fit in the Guinness
Book of World Records for complainers.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.885
- Hey, come on!
- Sorry. You wanna throw our ball back?

36:28.973 --> 36:33.489
- We look like your servants? Get it yourself.
- Hey, we said we're sorry.

36:33.573 --> 36:38.089
- Don't give us any shit. Just give me the ball.
- Don't do it, Joe. Look at the mess they made.

36:38.173 --> 36:40.607
- If I was you, I'd keep quiet, pops.
- Oh, yeah?

36:40.693 --> 36:42.888
Hold it a minute!

36:43.813 --> 36:45.963
Let's be gentlemen about this.

36:46.053 --> 36:49.409
I say we settle this with a little four on four.

36:49.493 --> 36:50.812
- Great idea.

36:50.893 --> 36:52.372
- Get real.
- Are you nuts?

36:52.453 --> 36:59.609
I'll tell you what I think. I bet $10 we can
make 11 baskets before you hotshots can.

36:59.693 --> 37:02.765
- My money's on the table. Come on.
- Oh, right.

37:02.853 --> 37:05.003
Like taking money from a dying man.

37:05.093 --> 37:08.051
- You dudes got yourself a game.
- Good.

37:19.013 --> 37:21.322
Whoo! In your face, grandpa.

37:21.413 --> 37:25.406
- Ben, over here.
- Get him. Watch him, watch him.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.484
Art! Art!

37:30.333 --> 37:32.005
I got him. I got him.

37:34.173 --> 37:36.448
Just like downtown.

37:36.533 --> 37:39.331
OK, no more charity. Now we're gonna play.

37:39.973 --> 37:43.329
- Over here, man.
- Defence. Watch the defence.

37:44.613 --> 37:46.649
I got him. I got him.

37:49.253 --> 37:51.369
Fellas, let's not give up.

37:51.453 --> 37:56.049
- Joe, what's the score?
- 7-1, for God's sake.

38:01.053 --> 38:03.487
Art, shoot!

38:04.333 --> 38:06.927
8-2! We're catching up.

38:07.013 --> 38:09.607
- Guard your man!
- Guard your... Where? What?

38:09.693 --> 38:11.684
Guard who, Joe? Who?

38:12.893 --> 38:15.726
Hey, hey, watch it. Here we go.

38:18.573 --> 38:20.484
Hey, that's 9-2. You guys give up?

38:20.573 --> 38:22.564
No! Do you?

38:25.093 --> 38:29.609
- Time out. Time out. Come on.
- What's the matter? You pooped?

38:29.693 --> 38:31.968
Fellas? Fellas?

38:33.053 --> 38:36.648
OK, I think it's time
we showed 'em what we learned.

38:36.733 --> 38:39.566
- You're damn right. Art?
- I couldn't agree more.

38:39.653 --> 38:40.847
Let's go.

38:41.733 --> 38:43.405
Now, boys. Now.

38:44.173 --> 38:47.051
Watch him. Come on, man, cover.
Get him.

38:47.133 --> 38:49.124
Go, Art. Go!

38:51.013 --> 38:53.163
Come on, take him.

38:53.253 --> 38:54.402
Oh!

38:57.453 --> 38:59.330
Great, Joe! Great.

39:00.013 --> 39:02.766
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

39:02.853 --> 39:04.844
Go, Ben. Go!

39:08.813 --> 39:11.202
- What's the score?
- 10-5. Guard your man.

39:11.293 --> 39:14.330
Which one is my... I say, which one is my...

39:16.293 --> 39:18.284
Watch it.

39:20.373 --> 39:22.443
Cover him.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.286
- Get him!
- Attaboy!

39:25.373 --> 39:27.887
Are you my man?

39:34.813 --> 39:37.885
9-10, your favour. Getting nervous?

39:58.533 --> 40:01.047
Aaaargh-agh!

40:03.613 --> 40:04.807
Art!

40:11.613 --> 40:13.410
Hallelujah!

40:15.413 --> 40:17.483
10-10. Next basket wins.

40:21.453 --> 40:25.366
All right, all right.
I'm free. Over here, over here.

40:25.453 --> 40:27.045
Bernie! Bernie!

40:39.493 --> 40:43.247
Bernie, go for it!

40:45.773 --> 40:48.082
In your face, junior.

40:48.173 --> 40:52.451
Bernie, you're the greatest!
You're the greatest!

40:59.373 --> 41:01.807
Oh... Oh...

41:01.893 --> 41:04.202
That is to die.

41:04.293 --> 41:09.003
- It sure is. The price tag alone'd kill you.
- Maybe you should try it on.

41:09.093 --> 41:12.529
Are you kidding?
I've never shopped in a store like this.

41:12.613 --> 41:16.572
Me either. Where would any of us
wear a get-up like that?

41:16.653 --> 41:18.644
In our dreams.

41:19.493 --> 41:21.484
That settles it.

41:31.733 --> 41:34.122
Oh, it's terrific.

41:38.573 --> 41:40.564
Ta-da!

41:48.173 --> 41:50.164
It's gorgeous.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.924
Aaargh!

42:12.333 --> 42:14.528
I don't believe it!

42:16.573 --> 42:19.292
Oh! Wow!

42:19.373 --> 42:22.206
Bess, that's naughty.

42:22.293 --> 42:25.888
Oh, that's so sexy. I think it suits you.

42:29.293 --> 42:32.046
Oh, Bess? Oh.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.569
- Jean, get some water.
- Are you all right?

42:50.413 --> 42:52.404
How about some hot coffee?

42:52.493 --> 42:56.168
I just can't understand what could be wrong.

42:58.093 --> 43:00.163
She was in perfect health.

43:00.253 --> 43:03.848
And the minute we get back... this happens.

43:05.773 --> 43:09.766
There isn't any justice.
If there were, it'd be me in there, not her.

43:09.853 --> 43:13.766
- Now, don't be ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.

43:13.853 --> 43:16.208
You don't know her, Joe.

43:16.293 --> 43:18.284
Not the way I do.

43:19.133 --> 43:25.527
She's the most generous,
loving and giving person I've ever met.

43:26.813 --> 43:32.410
She's the only one that's ever really loved me.

43:33.933 --> 43:38.165
I'd trade places with her in a heartbeat...

43:38.253 --> 43:40.244
if I could.

44:02.693 --> 44:05.605
OK. Just a few more inches, Bob.

44:05.693 --> 44:08.287
You're doing very well.

44:21.253 --> 44:24.325
- All right. That's fine.

44:24.413 --> 44:26.802
Doug, Ray, let's lift it off.

44:29.613 --> 44:31.604
Carefully! Carefully.

44:57.613 --> 44:59.410
Don't be afraid.

45:17.413 --> 45:19.404
You guys OK?

45:26.453 --> 45:29.092
What are we doing, gang?

45:29.173 --> 45:31.971
They've opened the cocoon, Jack.

45:33.293 --> 45:36.046
- Is he gonna be all right?
- For a short time.

45:36.133 --> 45:42.208
But if he doesn't get an infusion
of life force soon, he'll weaken quickly.

45:47.173 --> 45:49.164
Mr Selwyn?

45:49.853 --> 45:53.732
- That's me, Doctor. How is she?
- She's fine, considering her age

45:53.813 --> 45:58.011
and the fact that she's six weeks' pregnant.

45:58.093 --> 46:01.130
- Well, you smutty old devil.
- Pregnant?

46:01.213 --> 46:05.445
Very impressive, Mr Selwyn.
This one's definitely going in the books.

46:05.533 --> 46:08.605
- Congratulations.
- Pregnant? Pregnant?

46:08.693 --> 46:11.412
- Don't you go near him!
- She's pregnant. Pregnant?

46:11.493 --> 46:13.290
Uh-huh.

46:21.733 --> 46:24.850
- Safe.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

46:30.213 --> 46:32.852
Hold it a second. Let me clean the plate.

46:32.933 --> 46:35.128
Right, here we go. Let's play ball.

46:37.333 --> 46:40.643
- Strike!
- Come on, kid. Be a hitter.

46:40.733 --> 46:43.930
Come on, Davy.
Davy, you can do it.

46:44.613 --> 46:46.604
Strike two!

46:52.853 --> 46:55.686
You can do it. Let's play ball.
Come on, Davy.

46:55.773 --> 46:59.812
- Strike three! You're outta here.

47:06.933 --> 47:08.924
Well...

47:09.893 --> 47:11.884
How you doin'?

47:13.213 --> 47:17.650
Fine, considering I'm the worst player
in the whole league.

47:18.853 --> 47:22.289
That don't sound like the fella
I saw hit the ball yesterday.

47:22.373 --> 47:26.366
I told you. It's different when I'm with you...
you want me to hit it.

47:26.453 --> 47:30.685
And you think your pals
don't want you to hit it. Is that it?

47:30.773 --> 47:33.446
I'm just no good at stuff. I always mess up.

47:34.493 --> 47:36.882
You know, that could be true.

47:38.813 --> 47:40.804
I don't know.

47:42.333 --> 47:46.531
But I know you're not the only kid
that ever felt scared or anxious,

47:46.613 --> 47:48.843
or couldn't hit a baseball.

47:48.933 --> 47:53.927
You see, when I was a kid playing baseball,
a little younger than you,

47:54.013 --> 47:58.484
they always sent me to right field...
that's where they send the duds.

47:58.573 --> 48:02.566
Then when I got up to bat there was
no way in the world I could ever hit that ball.

48:02.653 --> 48:08.410
- But you can do it now.
- Sure, but I've had a whole life to work on it.

48:08.493 --> 48:11.371
You can hit too. I've seen you.

48:11.453 --> 48:13.967
You see...

48:14.053 --> 48:19.685
it looks to me like you're listening
to a lot of people tell you you can't do it,

48:19.773 --> 48:25.245
when maybe what you should be doing
is listening to yourself say that you can.

48:25.333 --> 48:27.449
And I want you to remember something.

48:27.533 --> 48:33.847
I love you, and all I want for you
is the very best that life has to offer,

48:33.933 --> 48:38.290
but, see, you're gonna
have to go get it yourself.

48:38.373 --> 48:39.772
Yeah.

48:41.013 --> 48:43.607
Now think about that, will you?

48:45.213 --> 48:47.010
OK.

48:48.373 --> 48:50.364
Thanks, Grandpa.

48:54.893 --> 48:56.884
Mr Finley?

49:04.453 --> 49:07.126
Won't you have a seat, Mr Finley?

49:08.333 --> 49:10.528
We'll talk about this.

49:10.613 --> 49:15.084
We don't really need to talk, Doctor.
Just tell me what's wrong.

49:16.413 --> 49:21.089
You had leukaemia a few years back,
but it went into complete remission, right?

49:21.173 --> 49:23.368
Right.

49:23.453 --> 49:26.445
- I've got it again, haven't I?
- Yes.

49:27.533 --> 49:29.808
I'd like to get you started on chemo.

49:32.493 --> 49:34.563
How long have I got, Doctor?

49:34.653 --> 49:41.923
The disease is unpredictable. It may spread
quickly or it may go into periodic remission.

49:42.013 --> 49:44.652
Six months, six years.

49:44.733 --> 49:47.566
I honestly don't know.

49:48.893 --> 49:50.884
Great.

49:55.173 --> 49:57.846
- I'll take over for a while.
- OK.

50:18.693 --> 50:20.684
If only you could talk.

50:40.093 --> 50:42.084
Did you do that?

51:08.013 --> 51:10.891
- Is he doing what I think he's doing?
- I think so.

51:10.973 --> 51:12.770
- Call Dr Baron.
- Right.

51:53.413 --> 51:55.404
Relax.

51:57.853 --> 52:00.890
Contraction ends.

52:00.973 --> 52:04.761
Now take a deep, cleansing breath.

52:07.773 --> 52:10.367
Oh, that's my little mommy.

52:23.853 --> 52:25.571
Hi.

52:25.653 --> 52:29.885
Thank goodness. I was just about
to organise a search party.

52:29.973 --> 52:32.248
I have so much to tell you.

52:33.773 --> 52:35.491
Me, too.

52:35.573 --> 52:38.326
Sorry I'm late. The market was jammed.

52:38.413 --> 52:43.248
This has been the most incredible day.
First Bess, and then guess what?

52:43.333 --> 52:47.770
I met a woman who runs
a preschool for foster children.

52:47.853 --> 52:51.892
She just called and offered me ajob.
Isn't that something?

52:51.973 --> 52:55.283
In all my life no one's ever offered me ajob.

52:55.373 --> 52:58.843
She said she was impressed
by the way I handled the children.

52:58.933 --> 53:02.369
- So what did you tell her?
- I said I'd have to talk to you.

53:02.453 --> 53:04.728
I'm going back tomorrow just to help out.

53:04.813 --> 53:08.089
How can you take ajob
when we're leaving in two days' time?

53:08.173 --> 53:14.487
Joe, for heaven's sake, I was just pleased
to get the offer. I didn't say I was taking it.

53:14.573 --> 53:18.122
Then why didn't you
turn her down on the spot?

53:18.213 --> 53:20.044
I don't know.

53:20.133 --> 53:23.523
I suppose I just wanted
the fantasy to last a little longer.

53:23.613 --> 53:26.002
I'll tell her tomorrow.

53:26.093 --> 53:27.685
What's your news?

53:28.893 --> 53:30.884
What?

53:31.853 --> 53:36.529
Those groceries are a lot more expensive
than they used to be.

53:38.493 --> 53:42.611
Thank you for coming.
We're going to start the demonstration now.

53:42.693 --> 53:44.684
Sara, please?

53:51.693 --> 53:53.888
- See?

54:04.733 --> 54:06.803
All right!

54:16.373 --> 54:19.570
You can't fool him, you see?

54:24.973 --> 54:26.964
Oh... Yes.

54:38.053 --> 54:41.887
We're gonna make arrangements
to move him to a secure location.

54:41.973 --> 54:45.568
- I want to keep this very quiet.
- Fine.

54:45.653 --> 54:48.611
- Good work. Job well done.
- Thank you.

54:48.693 --> 54:53.050
Congratulations. I am very impressed
with you and your facility.

54:53.133 --> 54:57.570
My reports to the Joint Chiefs
will reflect that.

54:57.653 --> 55:02.807
All I'm saying is we've no idea how a drastic
change in environment might affect him.

55:02.893 --> 55:07.921
He's losing his strength, and a dead alien
won't do you or the military any good.

55:08.013 --> 55:14.486
Sara, I know you're fond of him, but don't let
emotions overrule your scientific judgment.

55:14.573 --> 55:18.885
You're not giving him to MIT
or the Smithsonian, but to the Air Force!

55:18.973 --> 55:22.249
To the government.
There's a national security issue.

55:48.652 --> 55:50.449
There you are.

55:50.532 --> 55:54.127
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey.

55:54.212 --> 56:00.890
I got you a little something. Sort of
a "get your mind off your problems" present.

56:05.372 --> 56:07.840
Thank you. I really love it.

56:07.932 --> 56:12.289
Me, too. I can't understand why
we're not selling more of them though.

56:12.372 --> 56:14.408
You're a good friend, Jack.

56:14.492 --> 56:17.370
Friend? Friend, friend, friend, friend.

56:17.452 --> 56:21.730
Kitty, we are more than friends.
We shared ourselves and everything.

56:21.812 --> 56:24.406
Would you like it
if we shared ourselves again?

56:24.492 --> 56:28.565
Like it? I would love it.
I've been dreaming about it for five years.

56:28.652 --> 56:30.643
Then let's go back to your cabin.

56:30.732 --> 56:33.644
Huh? Whoa, ho, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

56:33.732 --> 56:39.602
You Antareans may have the market cornered
in sharing, but know nothing about romance.

56:39.692 --> 56:44.447
Kitty, I'm the kind of guy,
I need to have a nice dinner, you know?

56:44.532 --> 56:47.683
A little music, a little candlelight.

56:47.772 --> 56:52.288
I charmingly convince you
to ask me back to your cabin for a nightcap.

56:53.372 --> 56:55.408
And then...

56:55.492 --> 56:58.370
we share our brains out.

57:08.252 --> 57:10.243
Hop in.

57:27.092 --> 57:29.242
How can you stand this racket?

57:29.332 --> 57:32.529
What are you talking about?
This is a terrific joint.

57:32.612 --> 57:36.366
I haven't heard a word of English
since we walked into the place.

57:36.452 --> 57:40.889
You know something? When you want to,
you do a great impression of an old fart.

57:40.972 --> 57:42.405
Oh, thanks!

57:42.492 --> 57:44.926
Oh, thank you very much.

57:45.012 --> 57:46.730
Oh, whoo-whoo!

57:46.812 --> 57:49.167
I can't wait.

57:49.252 --> 57:51.129
Mmm!

57:51.212 --> 57:56.366
- What is this?
- It's Cuban punch. And it's delicious.

57:56.732 --> 58:01.931
Go ahead, Bernie. You'll probably hate it,
but go ahead. Force yourself.

58:11.132 --> 58:12.724
Uh-huh.

58:19.572 --> 58:23.690
Bernie... Bernie... Oh, my God.
You are a real nutcase.

58:23.772 --> 58:26.650
That's 151-proof rum!

58:31.652 --> 58:33.404
Maybe I was thirsty.

58:33.492 --> 58:35.881
Waitress! Oh, waitress!

58:40.212 --> 58:42.203
This way.

58:44.692 --> 58:48.731
I tell you, this place must be great...
I have no idea what we just ordered.

58:48.812 --> 58:52.361
Is this a ritual commonly practised
before people share themselves?

58:52.452 --> 58:56.491
Oh, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
See, this is romantic.

58:56.572 --> 59:01.441
You got champagne, ambience, you know.
Gets you in the mood.

59:01.852 --> 59:03.968
Mm, mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

59:04.052 --> 59:07.124
<i>- Voila. Bon appetit.
- Gracias!</i>

59:07.212 --> 59:09.851
- What is this, Jack?
- Uh...

59:09.932 --> 59:13.811
This is, um... Oh, this is bon appetit.
This is French food.

59:13.892 --> 59:19.728
See, it's terrifique. See, they don't
say "terrific", they say "terrifique".

59:21.612 --> 59:23.603
You OK?

59:27.572 --> 59:29.722
- Jack?
- Hm?

59:29.812 --> 59:34.249
I want to rub this bon appetit
over every inch of your body.

59:38.812 --> 59:40.803
- Really?
- Yes.

59:43.652 --> 59:46.883
Well, let's do it. Let's do it.
We'll get an order to go.

59:46.972 --> 59:49.770
Uh, garcon? Uh, senor?

59:53.852 --> 59:57.049
What did I say? I said something funny?

01:00:01.612 --> 01:00:05.764
Oops. I guess that bite
got away from you, huh, honey?

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:11.449
- What's the big idea?
- I'm really enjoying this bon appetit, Jack.

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:18.204
You're having an extraterrestrial
reaction to this.

01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:22.808
- Don't be silly. I feel wonderful.
- I think maybe the best thing would be...

01:00:22.892 --> 01:00:24.405
- No, Jack.
- Kitty, please.

01:00:24.492 --> 01:00:26.960
- No.
- Kitty, listen to me. You gotta trust me.

01:00:27.052 --> 01:00:29.327
No. Jack! Jack!

01:00:29.412 --> 01:00:31.209
Argh!

01:00:34.692 --> 01:00:37.286
Honey, what's the rush?
Don't you want your entree?

01:00:37.372 --> 01:00:38.885
Oh, my God!

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:43.250
No, Jack.
I want to share myself with you right now.

01:00:44.652 --> 01:00:46.449
Oh... Oh...

01:00:46.532 --> 01:00:52.289
Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea
in front of all these nice people.

01:00:52.372 --> 01:00:54.602
Whoa, hold it, Kitty. Don't do it.

01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:57.525
Not here. Not here.
Kitty, please! Heads up!

01:01:04.292 --> 01:01:06.089
Kitty!

01:01:12.532 --> 01:01:15.410
Must be something she ate. Huh.

01:01:18.492 --> 01:01:20.483
Incoming!

01:01:26.012 --> 01:01:27.604
Keep the change!

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:14.210
- I figured out something about you.
- Yeah? What?

01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:20.367
Once a person gets past that tight-ass routine
of yours, you're not a bad guy.

01:02:21.732 --> 01:02:25.930
No! And I'll tell you something else,
Lefkowitz,

01:02:26.012 --> 01:02:28.367
you make me laugh.

01:02:28.452 --> 01:02:30.443
Imitation of an owl.

01:02:39.412 --> 01:02:42.006
I think you're very pretty.

01:02:43.212 --> 01:02:45.203
You do?

01:02:47.332 --> 01:02:49.129
Thanks.

01:03:24.292 --> 01:03:27.090
- Rose!
- Bernie?

01:03:27.172 --> 01:03:28.969
Rosie.

01:03:31.052 --> 01:03:32.485
Hey, Bernie.

01:03:34.932 --> 01:03:38.811
- What's the matter? You sick?
- This was a mistake. I shouldn't have come.

01:03:38.892 --> 01:03:42.805
- Jesus Christ. What are you talking about?
- I can't do this to Rose.

01:03:42.892 --> 01:03:45.360
- I think we better go now.
- Bullshit!

01:03:45.452 --> 01:03:47.443
Bernie, bullshit!

01:03:48.412 --> 01:03:53.327
Your wife is just an excuse, d'you know that?
An excuse so you don't have to go on living.

01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:57.690
Well, guess what, buster?
Life goes on.

01:03:57.772 --> 01:04:00.605
And if you had any,
if you'll pardon my French, balls,

01:04:00.692 --> 01:04:03.206
you'd face up to the fact that she's dead.

01:04:03.292 --> 01:04:06.682
Rose is dead, Bernie, and you're not!

01:04:18.532 --> 01:04:20.523
Are you all right?

01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:24.363
Um, I, uh...

01:04:25.652 --> 01:04:29.611
I was going through
one of Susan's photo albums today,

01:04:29.692 --> 01:04:36.882
and there were some photos of David on
his fourteenth birthday at a New Year's party.

01:04:40.212 --> 01:04:44.490
It's five years of his growing up
that we've missed.

01:04:45.532 --> 01:04:51.641
This is our family. My life doesn't have
any meaning without them.

01:04:51.732 --> 01:04:55.407
Ben, I want us to stay here.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:58.086
I want us all to be together.

01:04:59.252 --> 01:05:03.564
Look, I know you're worried,
about the boy and his mother.

01:05:03.652 --> 01:05:05.643
I'm worried, too.

01:05:07.052 --> 01:05:13.844
Look around, honey. I mean, everybody
we know, except for Bernie, is sick or dying.

01:05:13.932 --> 01:05:16.446
They're dropping like flies.

01:05:17.732 --> 01:05:21.088
Honey, I don't wanna
watch that happen to you.

01:05:21.172 --> 01:05:24.005
I don't want it to happen to me.

01:05:24.092 --> 01:05:26.367
And we can beat it, you know?

01:05:27.412 --> 01:05:29.642
But it's not right.

01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:32.565
People shouldn't outlive their children.

01:05:34.132 --> 01:05:36.327
D'you want the truth?

01:05:41.012 --> 01:05:43.003
I'm scared to death.

01:05:44.812 --> 01:05:47.770
Don't you think I know that?

01:05:47.852 --> 01:05:51.447
I'm scared, too, but not of dying.

01:05:51.532 --> 01:05:54.330
I'm scared of living without you.

01:05:55.732 --> 01:05:58.530
But I don't want to leave here.

01:06:14.332 --> 01:06:16.323
Morning.

01:06:17.012 --> 01:06:19.082
- How's it going?
- Good.

01:06:19.172 --> 01:06:22.528
We can get in and out of the institute
without being discovered.

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.603
Great. Great.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:32.130
That was some date last night, huh?

01:06:32.212 --> 01:06:34.806
How are you feeling?

01:06:34.892 --> 01:06:37.201
Foolish.

01:06:37.292 --> 01:06:42.491
I should have known better than to eat
something when I didn't know what it was.

01:06:42.572 --> 01:06:45.803
But thank you for taking care of me.

01:06:45.892 --> 01:06:49.282
- So where did you sleep?
- Are you kidding? Sleep?

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:52.682
I was up all night
waiting for the cops to show up.

01:06:52.772 --> 01:06:54.967
Well, I guess we made a clean getaway.

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:58.328
I'm sorry, Jack. Is there any way
that I could make it up to you?

01:06:58.412 --> 01:07:01.085
Come on, come on, Kitty.

01:07:01.172 --> 01:07:06.246
Compared to some of my dates,
last night was a raging success.

01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:12.608
I don't know. Sometimes I think
maybe I'll be one of those guys

01:07:12.692 --> 01:07:17.368
who never finds anyone,
lives on TV dinners, talks to his dog,

01:07:17.452 --> 01:07:21.081
which is OK cos I kind of like dogs.

01:07:21.732 --> 01:07:26.567
Jack, I'd like to show you something, but in
order to see it you'll have to close your eyes.

01:07:27.572 --> 01:07:31.042
- This isn't gonna be anything kinky, is it?
- No, I don't think so.

01:07:31.132 --> 01:07:32.929
OK.

01:07:54.172 --> 01:07:56.288
Oh, oh, wow.

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:58.169
Sh.

01:09:43.372 --> 01:09:47.923
Vital signs are dropping fast.
Respiration rate's down. Looks bad.

01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:51.890
I think that dog and pony show wore him out.
What do you think?

01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:55.931
I think that in a couple of days
it'll be out of our hands.

01:09:56.012 --> 01:09:58.003
That's what I think.

01:10:06.132 --> 01:10:10.569
- How do you know it'll work?
- It has to work. He wasn't revived properly.

01:10:10.652 --> 01:10:13.405
If we don't get him back now,
he won't survive.

01:10:13.492 --> 01:10:15.483
We need your help.

01:10:16.972 --> 01:10:19.691
I don't know... Thanks.

01:10:19.772 --> 01:10:24.641
Breaking into that place sounds kind of risky,
especially now that the military's involved.

01:10:24.732 --> 01:10:26.927
Joe's right. What if we get caught?

01:10:27.012 --> 01:10:30.721
Will you listen to us?
We're back less than a week,

01:10:30.812 --> 01:10:34.168
and already we sound like
a bunch of frightened old geezers.

01:10:34.252 --> 01:10:36.846
Have we forgotten what they've given us?

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:41.767
We owe them everything, and if one of
their friends need help, I'll damn well give it.

01:10:41.852 --> 01:10:44.446
You can count me in.

01:10:47.172 --> 01:10:49.163
Well, we're in.

01:10:50.852 --> 01:10:54.447
- OK. Count us in, too.
- Good.

01:10:54.532 --> 01:10:57.808
Once we get our friend back,
we'll go to the rendezvous point.

01:10:57.892 --> 01:11:02.283
The ship will meet us at midnight.
If you have unfinished business, do it today.

01:11:02.372 --> 01:11:04.124
Joe.

01:11:05.452 --> 01:11:08.728
- Why don't you tell me, Joe?
- Bernie...

01:11:08.812 --> 01:11:11.280
- We were going to...
- Don't you "Bernie" me.

01:11:11.372 --> 01:11:14.250
You can all go straight to hell.

01:11:16.652 --> 01:11:19.007
Bernie!

01:11:19.092 --> 01:11:21.208
Goddamn it, Bernie, wait a minute.

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:26.685
When were you going to tell me, Joe? Or were
you going to let me find out after you'd gone?

01:11:26.772 --> 01:11:31.687
I didn't have the heart to tell you we were
only staying a while. I was trying to help you.

01:11:31.772 --> 01:11:35.765
Help me! You just yanked the rug
right out from under me.

01:11:35.852 --> 01:11:40.243
Do me a favour, go be a good
Samaritan somewhere else.

01:11:41.572 --> 01:11:47.044
You know, Bernie, you're the most miserable,
self-centred complainer I've ever met.

01:11:47.132 --> 01:11:52.331
Other people are in pain and afraid, and
if you'd open your eyes you might see that.

01:11:52.412 --> 01:11:56.530
As far as I'm concerned, you can feel sorry
for yourself until hell freezes over.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:12:00.400
You don't deserve to have friends like us.

01:12:08.732 --> 01:12:13.010
Here, here it is.
Now you throw it. Throw it fast.

01:12:13.092 --> 01:12:17.085
That's the way. That's the way.
Throw it to Mary.

01:12:20.852 --> 01:12:22.922
That's a good throw.

01:12:25.852 --> 01:12:27.843
Yeah, that's the way.

01:12:29.052 --> 01:12:31.043
Catch it.

01:12:39.452 --> 01:12:41.682
Anthony!

01:12:42.412 --> 01:12:44.607
- Anthony!
- Oh, no.

01:12:46.132 --> 01:12:48.566
Anthony!

01:12:52.692 --> 01:12:55.331
- Oh, God, no!

01:12:55.412 --> 01:12:58.802
Someone, please call an ambulance.

01:13:08.572 --> 01:13:10.369
Joe.

01:13:11.612 --> 01:13:13.603
Hello, Bernie.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:18.731
I went looking for you at the motel.

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:23.090
Ruby told me. I couldn't find the others.
How is she?

01:13:24.092 --> 01:13:26.083
Doesn't look good.

01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:32.527
Really something the way things work out.

01:13:32.612 --> 01:13:36.969
She was so happy to be back here,
and then this happens.

01:13:37.052 --> 01:13:39.043
Did you ever tell her?

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:43.363
- Tell her what?
- That you're sick again.

01:13:47.292 --> 01:13:49.487
I've known you over 30 years, Joe.

01:13:49.572 --> 01:13:54.362
After you blew up this afternoon,
I figured it out.

01:13:58.012 --> 01:14:00.401
Will you get better if you go back?

01:14:00.492 --> 01:14:02.608
I got better before.

01:14:02.692 --> 01:14:05.365
You don't get sick there.

01:14:07.252 --> 01:14:10.210
- Mr Finley?
- That's me.

01:14:10.932 --> 01:14:15.483
Your wife's vital signs are stable
at the moment, but she's comatose.

01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:19.724
I don't expect her to last the night.

01:14:19.812 --> 01:14:21.803
I'm sorry.

01:14:38.572 --> 01:14:41.564
- Can I see her?
- Yes, of course.

01:15:21.172 --> 01:15:24.960
Honey, can you hear me?

01:17:21.692 --> 01:17:23.284
Joe.

01:17:23.932 --> 01:17:26.400
Hello, my darling.

01:17:28.052 --> 01:17:31.010
What happened? I can't remember...

01:17:31.092 --> 01:17:33.481
You were in an accident.

01:17:33.572 --> 01:17:35.802
But you're gonna be fine.

01:17:37.612 --> 01:17:40.410
I dreamed I...

01:17:40.492 --> 01:17:44.087
Something was pulling me
farther and farther away.

01:17:45.052 --> 01:17:50.922
And then you came and held me
and wouldn't let me go.

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:01.242
My God, Joe.

01:18:01.332 --> 01:18:04.005
What's happened?

01:18:04.772 --> 01:18:09.402
- What have you done?
- I gave you a present.

01:18:09.492 --> 01:18:11.289
Something you needed.

01:18:12.492 --> 01:18:17.486
You know, a lot of my life
I've been a selfish son of a bitch.

01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:18.766
Oh...

01:18:21.972 --> 01:18:26.568
I haven't always taken care of you
the way I should have.

01:18:27.932 --> 01:18:30.127
But I always loved you.

01:18:30.212 --> 01:18:32.646
I know that, Joe.

01:18:32.732 --> 01:18:34.723
I've always known that.

01:18:36.372 --> 01:18:38.283
Joe...

01:18:38.372 --> 01:18:40.522
I can't be without you.

01:18:40.612 --> 01:18:45.208
Sure you can.
I want you to take thatjob.

01:18:47.492 --> 01:18:49.483
And anyway...

01:18:51.252 --> 01:18:53.049
my time's run out.

01:18:53.172 --> 01:18:55.163
Oh, Joe.

01:18:58.372 --> 01:19:00.363
I am so tired.

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:05.408
I am...

01:19:05.492 --> 01:19:08.484
so damn tired.

01:19:13.492 --> 01:19:15.687
Then rest, darling.

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:21.561
Go ahead and rest.

01:19:41.212 --> 01:19:43.009
Well...

01:19:43.852 --> 01:19:46.047
that's the end of an era.

01:19:47.212 --> 01:19:49.407
Won't be the same now.

01:19:50.372 --> 01:19:53.603
We never should've come back.

01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:57.970
If we'd stayed put,
this never would have happened.

01:19:58.092 --> 01:20:01.402
Aw, you can't second-guess fate.

01:20:01.492 --> 01:20:07.362
You gotta take it the way it comes,
then try and figure out how to deal with it.

01:20:09.212 --> 01:20:13.000
Joe would have liked this.
He loved the beach.

01:20:13.132 --> 01:20:15.168
He didn't give a shit about the beach.

01:20:15.252 --> 01:20:21.043
It's them smooth-legged girls in them
dental-floss bikinis... that's what he liked!

01:20:22.652 --> 01:20:25.405
I'm gonna miss that old son of a bitch.

01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:27.289
Yeah.

01:20:28.412 --> 01:20:30.403
Me too, pal.

01:20:31.732 --> 01:20:33.723
Me too.

01:20:58.412 --> 01:21:00.403
She's finally asleep.

01:21:29.772 --> 01:21:31.683
Ohh...

01:21:59.332 --> 01:22:02.722
Art, honey, can you give me a hand?

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.807
I'll be right there.

01:22:11.852 --> 01:22:14.047
I think we overdid this.

01:22:14.692 --> 01:22:17.729
Half of these things won't fit.

01:22:17.812 --> 01:22:20.690
I've been thinking.

01:22:20.772 --> 01:22:23.809
Could we be making a mistake?

01:22:23.892 --> 01:22:28.841
I mean, are we doing right... by our child?

01:22:31.612 --> 01:22:34.490
Is it fair to take him that far away?

01:22:35.812 --> 01:22:38.645
I know it won't matter when he's young, but...

01:22:38.732 --> 01:22:41.371
what about when he grows up?

01:22:41.452 --> 01:22:45.127
Think of what he'll be missing.

01:22:45.212 --> 01:22:49.251
All those experiences we took for granted,

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:51.323
he won't have.

01:22:52.892 --> 01:22:57.841
Art, do you really think
I hadn't thought about that?

01:22:57.932 --> 01:23:03.404
For all the snowflakes and sunsets
and rainbows he won't see,

01:23:03.492 --> 01:23:07.041
think of what he will have,
think of what he'll gain.

01:23:07.132 --> 01:23:09.726
A world with no illness,

01:23:09.812 --> 01:23:13.043
no poverty, no wars.

01:23:13.132 --> 01:23:15.930
Besides, if we stay here,

01:23:17.252 --> 01:23:20.050
our child might not be born.

01:23:22.332 --> 01:23:26.530
We'd never live long enough
to see him grow up.

01:23:38.092 --> 01:23:40.083
Well, it's time we head out.

01:23:40.172 --> 01:23:42.163
Be a good boy.

01:23:47.492 --> 01:23:52.202
- Take good care of your mother.
- Wait a minute, Grandpa.

01:24:01.292 --> 01:24:03.283
Thanks.

01:24:14.212 --> 01:24:16.203
- Have a safe trip.
- Bye-bye now.

01:24:16.292 --> 01:24:18.010
Bye, Ruby.

01:24:18.092 --> 01:24:22.882
Oh, we can'tjust leave you here like this.
Please, won't you come with us?

01:24:22.972 --> 01:24:28.410
I belong here. I'm going to take thatjob
with the children. It's what I want.

01:24:28.492 --> 01:24:33.282
- You'll be all alone.
- What am I, chopped liver? She'll be fine.

01:24:34.572 --> 01:24:36.802
We're gonna miss you...

01:24:36.892 --> 01:24:38.928
more than you know.

01:24:40.012 --> 01:24:42.082
- Goodbye, Bernie.
- Bye, Art.

01:24:42.772 --> 01:24:46.845
- I hate these long goodbyes, so bye, my girl.
- Bye-bye.

01:24:46.932 --> 01:24:51.289
- Bernie, I'm glad I got to see you.
- Me too, Ben.

01:24:51.372 --> 01:24:54.170
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mary.

01:25:02.332 --> 01:25:04.323
Bye, Bernie. Bye.

01:25:05.452 --> 01:25:07.443
- Goodbye, Alma.
- Bye.

01:25:18.052 --> 01:25:20.043
Be careful, Jack.

01:26:15.492 --> 01:26:18.962
- Goin' to get something to eat.
- Bring me back a burger.

01:26:59.212 --> 01:27:01.203
I'm so sorry.

01:29:17.892 --> 01:29:20.611
Down by six, right?

01:29:58.652 --> 01:30:00.643
Come on.

01:30:02.172 --> 01:30:05.244
You take the passenger side.

01:30:54.052 --> 01:30:56.612
Good evening, Doc.
You're working kinda late.

01:30:56.692 --> 01:31:00.731
Yeah, well, I had a couple of things
I had to finish up.

01:31:02.292 --> 01:31:04.089
You have a good evening.

01:31:52.412 --> 01:31:55.324
- Power failure!
- Rebecca, get Engineering.

01:31:55.412 --> 01:31:57.972
- Right.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.564
Damn!

01:32:02.852 --> 01:32:04.843
That was weird.

01:32:06.732 --> 01:32:09.883
- Oh, my God. Rebecca, get Dr Baron!
- Right.

01:32:12.332 --> 01:32:15.927
- He's not in here.
- Phil!

01:32:16.012 --> 01:32:18.970
- Phil!
- Where the hell would he go?

01:32:20.092 --> 01:32:22.731
- This way.
- Yeah, let's check it out.

01:32:22.812 --> 01:32:26.361
- Have you seen anything?
- This way, this way.

01:32:41.252 --> 01:32:42.446
Phil.

01:32:43.692 --> 01:32:46.331
- Don't run.
- Sara, make sure the building is sealed.

01:32:46.412 --> 01:32:48.880
- Don't forget the sea door by the tanks.
- Right.

01:32:48.972 --> 01:32:51.042
Be careful. Don't frighten him.

01:32:55.492 --> 01:32:58.768
There's someone in the building.
Check out the west wing.

01:33:13.892 --> 01:33:16.565
Let's go back to the lab.

01:33:18.892 --> 01:33:22.202
- Nothing down that way, sir.
- All right... all right.

01:33:22.292 --> 01:33:26.808
We split up here. Everyone takes a door and
stays put. Nothing gets out of this building.

01:33:26.892 --> 01:33:29.167
Doug. Rebecca.

01:33:29.252 --> 01:33:31.607
You, come with me. Come on.

01:33:31.692 --> 01:33:34.081
I'll check the central core.

01:33:38.252 --> 01:33:41.562
OK. OK. We better move.

01:34:11.972 --> 01:34:13.564
Grandpa!

01:34:13.652 --> 01:34:16.769
David? Good.
Come on, you can help me.

01:34:24.812 --> 01:34:27.372
We're gonna have to do this, son.
Take a hold.

01:34:28.332 --> 01:34:30.323
Let's get it open.

01:34:31.772 --> 01:34:34.002
Lean in.

01:34:38.492 --> 01:34:40.960
All right. Push, David. Push.

01:34:44.452 --> 01:34:46.249
Aagh!

01:34:47.972 --> 01:34:49.963
I got it, Gramps!

01:35:04.172 --> 01:35:06.481
Stop!

01:35:07.732 --> 01:35:09.529
What are you doing?

01:35:10.892 --> 01:35:13.247
Well, you see, he's my friend.

01:35:13.332 --> 01:35:15.448
And we're gonna take him home.

01:35:16.012 --> 01:35:17.809
OK?

01:35:38.372 --> 01:35:40.567
Here they come.

01:35:59.692 --> 01:36:01.922
Did you see anyone, ma'am?

01:36:02.012 --> 01:36:03.604
No.

01:36:15.732 --> 01:36:18.610
- Ahoy!
- Hello. Welcome back.

01:36:30.892 --> 01:36:32.883
There we go.

01:36:34.492 --> 01:36:37.882
All right, sir. There you go.

01:36:46.052 --> 01:36:49.249
- There you go, my boy.
- Hello, darling.

01:36:49.332 --> 01:36:52.005
- David, what are you doing here?
- Grandma.

01:36:52.092 --> 01:36:55.767
Are you all right? Are you both all right?
What happened?

01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:59.925
Now, Mother, he was a lot of help to me
and without him, I wouldn't be here.

01:37:00.012 --> 01:37:05.484
- Yeah. I did all right, didn't I, Grandpa?
- I'll say! Hitting a baseball'll be a cinch now.

01:37:05.572 --> 01:37:07.722
I wish you'd be here to see it.

01:37:10.732 --> 01:37:12.962
We will be.

01:37:13.052 --> 01:37:14.690
What?

01:37:14.772 --> 01:37:18.481
- Well, hell, that's what you want, isn't it?
- Oh, Ben!

01:37:18.572 --> 01:37:22.360
Oh, thank you, my darling. Thank you.

01:38:04.132 --> 01:38:06.327
Walter!

01:38:07.572 --> 01:38:11.042
- Good to see you, Jack.
- You make one hell of an entrance.

01:38:11.132 --> 01:38:13.805
Thank you.

01:38:13.892 --> 01:38:17.726
- You've done well.
- He's weak, but he'll survive.

01:38:22.052 --> 01:38:24.202
Well, I see the gang's all here.

01:38:24.292 --> 01:38:28.046
- Not the whole gang.
- I know.

01:38:28.132 --> 01:38:31.249
I'm sorry about Joe. He was a good man.

01:38:31.332 --> 01:38:34.324
And a good friend to all of us.

01:38:35.612 --> 01:38:39.321
Well, Ben, are you sure
you won't come with us?

01:38:39.412 --> 01:38:41.972
Real sure.

01:38:42.052 --> 01:38:44.407
I tell you.

01:38:44.492 --> 01:38:49.361
See, Walter, a man's
not supposed to outlive his children.

01:38:53.732 --> 01:38:57.964
And besides, I may see you
some other time, some other place.

01:38:58.052 --> 01:39:00.771
That may be true, Ben.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:03.650
Well, I think it's time to leave.

01:39:07.652 --> 01:39:10.644
You've no idea how we'll miss you.

01:39:11.452 --> 01:39:14.125
You'll make a wonderful mother.

01:39:14.932 --> 01:39:18.129
You'll make a wonderful grandmother.

01:39:19.932 --> 01:39:22.924
You won't forget us, will you?

01:39:23.012 --> 01:39:25.003
Forget you? Ha!

01:39:26.412 --> 01:39:28.403
No, we won't forget you.

01:39:30.132 --> 01:39:35.923
Now, you better get goin'.
You'll miss your connection in Baltimore!

01:39:40.412 --> 01:39:44.087
I thought you only cried
when somebody died.

01:39:46.092 --> 01:39:48.890
Or when your friends are leaving.

01:39:57.652 --> 01:39:59.643
Yeah!

01:40:00.772 --> 01:40:02.763
I see what you mean.

01:40:03.532 --> 01:40:05.523
Goodbye, Ben.

01:40:12.932 --> 01:40:16.129
Well... Oh, hey, come here.

01:40:18.092 --> 01:40:21.528
I got something here that means a lot to me.

01:40:21.612 --> 01:40:23.409
I want you to have it, Kitty.

01:40:23.492 --> 01:40:26.370
It's my high-school graduation photo.

01:40:26.452 --> 01:40:30.081
I got it framed so you can
put it on the TV or something.

01:40:30.172 --> 01:40:32.970
Thank you. I really love it, Jack.

01:40:34.732 --> 01:40:36.723
I'll miss you, Kitty.

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:43.731
- I'll miss you too, Jack.
- I'm sorry. Kitty, it's time.

01:43:22.452 --> 01:43:24.727
Excuse me?

01:43:25.252 --> 01:43:29.165
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, but
I ran out of gas and you were the only light.

01:43:29.252 --> 01:43:32.085
Do you know a place nearby
where I can get gasoline?

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:34.163
I'll be right with you.

01:43:36.452 --> 01:43:40.161
Yeah, there's an all-nighter
about a mile down the road.

01:43:40.252 --> 01:43:42.368
I can give you a lift, if you want.

01:43:42.452 --> 01:43:46.240
- Sure you wouldn't mind?
- Oh, no. No problem.

01:43:48.012 --> 01:43:51.925
- Kinda late to be out, huh?
- Yeah. Well, I'm just on my way from work.

01:43:52.012 --> 01:43:53.650
At this hour?!

01:43:53.732 --> 01:43:56.451
I wouldn't want yourjob.

01:43:56.532 --> 01:43:58.921
Neither would I. I just quit.

01:44:03.892 --> 01:44:07.931
- Why are you looking at me that way?
- Honestly, this is no line, I swear,

01:44:08.012 --> 01:44:10.401
but I think I know you from somewhere.

01:44:10.492 --> 01:44:12.608
- No, I don't think so.
- You sure?

01:44:12.692 --> 01:44:15.490
- Yeah.
- You look so familiar.

01:44:15.572 --> 01:44:18.644
No, I never forget a face.

01:44:18.732 --> 01:44:21.121
I'm sure I'd remember yours.

01:44:22.092 --> 01:44:25.926
- My name's Jack. Jack Bonner.
- Sara. Nice to meet you, Jack.

01:44:26.012 --> 01:44:28.003
Pleasure.

01:44:29.172 --> 01:44:33.085
- It's chilly, isn't it?
- Yeah. Well, you know, down... Oh!

01:44:33.172 --> 01:44:35.163
Where's my manners?

01:44:37.292 --> 01:44:40.090
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

01:44:51.132 --> 01:44:53.487
- Ever been in a glass-bottom boat?
- No.

01:44:53.572 --> 01:44:56.040
- Wanna go on one?
- Yeah, I've always wanted to.

01:44:56.132 --> 01:44:57.531
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:44:57.612 --> 01:44:59.204
- Well, I got one.
- Really?

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:04.491
Yeah. Well, the bank owns it, but you're
looking at a captain of a glass-bottom boat.
