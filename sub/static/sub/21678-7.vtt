00:01.337 --> 00:03.584
Look!
Barry got the stash house!

00:03.624 --> 00:06.530
Now Cristobal will come here
to US.

00:06.570 --> 00:07.944
"Hey!

00:08.012 --> 00:10.679
You took my
fucking stash house!

00:10.719 --> 00:12.858
I'm going to slit
your fucking throats!"

00:12.898 --> 00:14.887
And we will be waiting for him.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.813
Yes, because they are short,
right.

00:18.709 --> 00:20.423
Here,
it's all in the book.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.543
Gene's teachings
changed my life.

00:22.620 --> 00:23.964
- Here.
- What's this?

00:24.041 --> 00:25.673
Money, from the stash house.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.488
Count it out,
this is your half.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.006
What's up dude?

00:29.083 --> 00:30.261
What the fuck are they
doing here?

00:30.328 --> 00:32.136
You said you needed more
manpower for a bum-rush.

00:32.203 --> 00:33.298
Get out of the car, Chris.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.432
- What? Why? Whoa!
- Get out of the fucking car.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.640
- Whoa! Dude, dude, dude!
- Get out of the car now!

00:38.693 --> 00:40.210
Taylor, they're already here!

00:40.287 --> 00:43.029
The plane's already here!
Taylor, stop!

02:37.732 --> 02:39.648
Oh, wow.

02:42.874 --> 02:44.421
That was a rough one.

02:45.202 --> 02:46.947
These little planes...

02:50.875 --> 02:52.155
Hey.

02:52.562 --> 02:54.006
You're not gonna
believe this.

02:54.101 --> 02:57.210
The pilot is from the same village
as my grandfather in Bolivia.

02:57.287 --> 02:59.835
It's fucking crazy,
right? Whoo!

03:00.746 --> 03:02.647
Whoa. What happened?

03:03.093 --> 03:05.989
I've only been here for two minutes.
You already shoot someone?

03:09.005 --> 03:10.515
A bum rush?

03:12.959 --> 03:14.655
Ver por ellos! Go, go.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.471
Soldados?

03:48.072 --> 03:49.549
Give me your phone.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.690
Okay, Goran.

04:10.942 --> 04:13.784
Here is all of Vacha's things.

04:15.583 --> 04:18.322
Maybe we donate tools
to local veterinarian.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.307
Throw them out.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.517
Oh. We having guests?

04:22.616 --> 04:26.766
I'm putting this out for when fucking
cops come to ask me questions.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.299
You want I should
go get a babka, huh?

04:29.673 --> 04:31.191
Maybe two babkas?

04:32.079 --> 04:33.651
Don't get cinnamon kind.

04:34.021 --> 04:35.819
Makes me sneeze.

04:36.162 --> 04:37.307
Hello?

04:37.432 --> 04:39.034
Hey. Goran.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.166
Yes?

04:40.250 --> 04:42.028
Oh, man,
it's Cristobal.

04:42.096 --> 04:43.674
Sifuentes.
From Bolivia?

04:43.852 --> 04:45.345
How are you?

04:46.625 --> 04:48.487
I am okay.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.131
It's Cristobal.

04:50.276 --> 04:52.057
How is he still alive?
Shh.

04:52.388 --> 04:55.002
Cristobal, how are you?

04:55.159 --> 04:57.048
Well, complicated question,
you see.

04:57.125 --> 05:00.463
Uh, I flew in because my guys
said you took my stash house.

05:00.627 --> 05:03.752
And just now, two military
guys tried to kill me.

05:03.820 --> 05:04.888
Two?

05:04.956 --> 05:06.854
Was Barry working
with someone?

05:07.041 --> 05:09.465
I hope this aggression
isn't just about business.

05:09.627 --> 05:12.585
If you wanted in on my stash house,
all you had to do was call me.

05:12.662 --> 05:14.840
Is he angry?
I can't tell.

05:15.002 --> 05:17.423
You know I have been
a fan of yours for a while.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.627
Like when you sent me
that bullet via DHL,

05:19.704 --> 05:21.256
I was like, wow!

05:21.333 --> 05:23.557
This guy, he is next level.

05:23.721 --> 05:25.731
<i>Listen,
I know how hard it is...</i>

05:25.799 --> 05:28.956
to break into Los Angeles, but you and
I, we should be working together.

05:29.107 --> 05:30.946
Not against each other, no?

05:31.281 --> 05:32.413
What's happening?

05:32.581 --> 05:34.247
He is super nice guy.

05:34.315 --> 05:36.405
That's great.
We fucked up.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.673
Cristobal, it, uh...

05:39.875 --> 05:42.673
it seems I got some
bad information.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.126
Uh, I was told
I had to attack you

05:45.203 --> 05:48.221
because you were
bloodthirsty maniac.

05:48.289 --> 05:49.917
Wha...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.528
Whoever told you that...
is just wrong.

05:52.596 --> 05:53.715
We need to kill Fuches.

05:53.792 --> 05:55.960
I mean, you just assume
that I am this...

05:56.037 --> 05:57.835
mean guy,
without ever meeting me?

05:57.948 --> 06:01.001
How... Listen, do you know the
book The Four Agreements?

06:01.346 --> 06:03.971
Hm? You owe it to yourself.
It is life-changing.

06:04.057 --> 06:06.277
Agreement three in the book:

06:06.448 --> 06:07.658
"Don't make assumptions."

06:07.742 --> 06:09.169
Don't make assumptions.

06:09.237 --> 06:11.315
Is that from The Four
Agreements? Such a great book.

06:11.383 --> 06:14.299
Maybe we could, uh,
take two step backward,

06:14.412 --> 06:15.792
start over, hm?

06:15.860 --> 06:17.865
I wish we could, but...

06:18.041 --> 06:19.757
you killed a bunch of my guys,

06:19.834 --> 06:22.026
so now I have to kill
a bunch of your guys.

06:22.096 --> 06:23.385
You know how this shit goes.

06:23.453 --> 06:26.362
Men I just sent are dead, yes?

06:26.676 --> 06:28.010
Barry's dead?

06:28.167 --> 06:30.698
The same military guy
you just kill,

06:30.768 --> 06:33.049
he kill few
of my guys too, so...

06:33.117 --> 06:35.596
maybe we are now
all even Kevin.

06:35.708 --> 06:36.802
If only, man.

06:36.870 --> 06:38.997
Agreement one
in the book is:

06:39.099 --> 06:41.355
"Be impeccable
with your word."

06:41.706 --> 06:43.987
I have to back
my people here.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.721
So...

06:45.812 --> 06:47.270
Yeah.

06:47.338 --> 06:48.465
It's a war now.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.690
War?

06:51.095 --> 06:52.387
This is...

06:52.667 --> 06:54.987
really not good news for me.

07:38.565 --> 07:40.233
Quien Eres?
Fucking Christ.

07:40.310 --> 07:42.112
All right, hey.
Hey, man.

07:42.201 --> 07:44.485
Quien Eres?
Para quien trabajas?

07:48.251 --> 07:49.517
Chris...

07:49.585 --> 07:50.754
Chris, shoot him.

07:50.822 --> 07:53.213
Diga me! Estas muerto.

07:56.221 --> 07:58.377
Chris, he radios his buddies,
we're dead.

07:58.454 --> 07:59.960
Chris, do it, now.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.321
Chris. Chris!

08:02.689 --> 08:04.370
Chris! Chris!

08:04.638 --> 08:06.267
Chris!

08:16.039 --> 08:17.402
Come on, let's go.

08:17.470 --> 08:18.832
Oh, shit...

08:22.458 --> 08:24.590
Chris. Chris?
Hey, hey. We gotta go.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.256
We gotta go, come on.
No, no, no.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.853
Pick that up. Pick that up.
We'll get rid of it, come on.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.571
Fuck.

08:36.336 --> 08:37.796
This is Noho Hank.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.315
Hey, bud.

08:39.405 --> 08:40.701
Uh, Barry hasn't called you

08:40.828 --> 08:42.751
to tell you how
the job went yet, has he?

08:42.828 --> 08:45.217
Because, you know,
he usually calls me

08:45.412 --> 08:46.838
and I haven't
heard from him.

08:48.263 --> 08:50.677
Did Barry do this job
with someone else?

08:50.745 --> 08:53.946
A military buddy, perhaps?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.321
Maybe. Why?

08:57.538 --> 08:59.224
Because if he did,

08:59.896 --> 09:01.177
Barry's dead.

09:01.286 --> 09:02.306
What?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.583
Yeah.

09:03.827 --> 09:05.558
I hasn't really hit me yet.

09:05.947 --> 09:07.728
Super broken up about it.

09:08.445 --> 09:11.308
Just a big kick in the balls.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.654
Fuches?

09:14.573 --> 09:16.152
Are you there?

09:21.753 --> 09:23.293
You killed a bunch of my guys,

09:23.370 --> 09:25.511
so now I have to kill
a bunch of your guys.

09:25.579 --> 09:26.988
You know how
this shit goes.

09:27.056 --> 09:29.396
Men I just
sent are dead, yes?

09:29.466 --> 09:30.477
Yeah.

09:30.545 --> 09:32.849
The same military
guy you just kill,

09:32.917 --> 09:35.043
he kill few
of my guys too, so...

09:35.120 --> 09:37.710
maybe we are now
all even Kevin.

09:37.787 --> 09:38.941
Military?

09:39.065 --> 09:41.050
Agreement
one in the book is:

09:41.120 --> 09:43.492
- "Be impeccable with your word."
- Mm.

09:43.646 --> 09:45.232
I have to back
my people here,

09:45.300 --> 09:48.219
so, ha, ha, yeah,
it's a war now.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.406
War?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.923
This is really not
good news for me.

09:53.078 --> 09:55.710
You know, if you wish-list
The Four Agreements on Amazon,

09:55.787 --> 09:58.085
I'll buy it for you.
You really never read it, huh?

09:58.324 --> 10:00.982
My wife gave
me Mars/Venus book...

10:01.066 --> 10:03.173
Okay, there's
about ten more minutes of discussion,

10:03.250 --> 10:05.585
of The Four Agreements
and other self-help books,

10:05.662 --> 10:07.126
many of which are terrific.

10:07.203 --> 10:09.835
There's no shame in seeking
help, is my point.

10:09.912 --> 10:11.919
Anyway, it's all
in the transcript.

10:11.996 --> 10:14.923
The upshot is,
we are looking for two DBs

10:15.000 --> 10:16.585
at some sort of airstrip,

10:16.662 --> 10:18.673
one or both
possible military,

10:18.750 --> 10:20.402
and I guarantee you,

10:20.574 --> 10:23.145
one of them
is our Bigfoot here.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.723
Detective Moss,
would you like to...

10:28.625 --> 10:31.223
Okay, apparently we're done.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.910
Barry, where the fuck
have you been?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.340
You look like shit.

10:45.426 --> 10:47.669
The cops came and they found
money hidden in the theater,

10:47.777 --> 10:50.028
and they shot a guy. They think
Ryan was involved with the mob!

10:50.095 --> 10:51.137
What?

10:51.205 --> 10:54.058
Also, we changed the scene. I'm
Macbeth and your line is different.

10:54.519 --> 10:55.709
What?

10:55.801 --> 10:57.792
"I have almost forgot

10:58.166 --> 10:59.917
"the taste of fears.

11:00.550 --> 11:04.256
"The time has been
my senses would have cooled.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.256
"To hear a night-shriek,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.298
"and my fell of hair
would at...

11:08.417 --> 11:10.256
At a dismal treat... treatise..."

11:10.333 --> 11:13.646
There's no way that was Ryan's money. He
borrowed money from me like 15 times.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.512
Right? And if he had all that cash,
why wouldn't he take new head-shots?

11:16.579 --> 11:19.673
Exactly! Hello!
His have bangs.

11:19.759 --> 11:22.098
"would at a dismal treatise,

11:22.166 --> 11:24.752
rouse and stir,
as life were in it..."

11:24.829 --> 11:26.042
Fuck!

11:28.500 --> 11:29.503
Sorry.

11:29.646 --> 11:30.735
Um, I just...

11:30.828 --> 11:32.902
Gene, I could really
use some direction here.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.698
It, uh,
to use the technical term,

11:35.833 --> 11:36.921
sucks.

11:37.098 --> 11:40.034
So why don't we just
go back to Lady Macbeth,

11:40.230 --> 11:42.066
and just chalk it up
to overreach.

11:42.161 --> 11:43.291
No!

11:44.370 --> 11:46.149
I'm playing Macbeth.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.279
"I have supped..."

11:53.875 --> 11:55.506
Chris, you gotta stop
calling me, man.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.001
I need to talk to you, man.

11:57.078 --> 12:00.293
Y-you... Okay, listen. You need
to relax and stop calling me.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.394
"familiar to my
slaughterous thoughts

12:02.462 --> 12:04.218
cannot once start me."

12:04.404 --> 12:07.077
Chill the fuck out, okay?

12:07.269 --> 12:09.597
"Cannot once start me!"

12:09.875 --> 12:11.697
Shit, I gotta go.

12:12.458 --> 12:13.960
"My Queen, the Lord...
My... my...

12:14.037 --> 12:15.632
My Lord,
the Queen is dead!"

12:15.709 --> 12:17.964
That's not the... I can't.
I just, I can't.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.126
I'm sorry, sorry.
I just got the line. Sorry.

12:20.203 --> 12:21.654
That's not
the fucking line!

12:21.722 --> 12:23.543
All right, everybody,
let's take a tight five.

12:23.620 --> 12:26.097
I'm talking a tight five!

12:26.413 --> 12:27.675
Nick!

12:37.375 --> 12:39.249
Well, that was something.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.790
You came charging
out there, huh?

12:43.858 --> 12:47.363
Equal parts
loud and raw.

12:48.271 --> 12:49.898
Your eyes as big as saucers.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.436
A little blood in your hair.
That's a nice touch.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.772
Are you on drugs, Barry?

12:56.062 --> 13:00.468
Because getting clean is an important
part of an actor's journey.

13:00.850 --> 13:03.173
A little story
to illustrate.

13:03.679 --> 13:06.752
I was doing Long Day's Journey Into
Night at the Pasadena Playhouse

13:06.829 --> 13:08.298
with a bunch of coke-heads.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.877
It's usually about
a three-hour play.

13:09.954 --> 13:12.710
We could bring it in
just under 37 minutes.

13:12.787 --> 13:14.548
We thought we were great.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.686
Apparently
we were unintelligible.

13:16.959 --> 13:20.335
It was the beginning of the bad
years, Barry. I don't know, I...

13:20.412 --> 13:22.960
Mr. Cousineau,
I'm... I'm not on drugs.

13:23.037 --> 13:25.381
- You're not?
- No.

13:25.458 --> 13:28.608
Well, then, that's very
bad news for you.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.202
Because it's one line,
Barry.

13:33.519 --> 13:35.853
And if tonight,
you're not high

13:35.921 --> 13:39.296
and you can't handle
one fucking line,

13:39.701 --> 13:42.981
then maybe this...
is not for you.

13:51.924 --> 13:52.924
Hmm.

13:53.023 --> 13:54.775
Who doesn't have
a freaking Facebook page?

13:54.843 --> 13:56.599
- Hey.
- What?

13:56.667 --> 14:00.126
Lancaster Sheriff's got a
shot-up car near an airstrip.

14:00.203 --> 14:03.182
Two DBs, both Marines.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.026
Let me guess.
One of them's this guy.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.898
No, but it you'd have
been right,

14:09.966 --> 14:11.752
that would have been
really cool.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.950
Okay, name is Taylor Garrett.

14:17.018 --> 14:18.632
Six feet, 415.

14:18.718 --> 14:20.245
He's a real hot-head.

14:20.313 --> 14:22.157
Has some 390s,

14:22.288 --> 14:23.431
drunk in public,

14:23.499 --> 14:24.831
punched a guy in a bar once,

14:24.899 --> 14:26.161
- broke his jaw.
- Mm-hmm.

14:26.287 --> 14:29.846
This is the same brick
as at the theater.

14:30.424 --> 14:33.112
Same... exact... amount.

14:33.260 --> 14:34.516
They split it.

14:34.648 --> 14:37.096
So, this guy and Ryan...

14:37.164 --> 14:38.447
were working together.

14:38.515 --> 14:39.854
Okay, just slow down.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.190
We need to connect them
to each other.

14:58.917 --> 15:01.710
Well, I'd say
that's a connection,

15:01.842 --> 15:03.245
wouldn't you?

15:07.176 --> 15:09.674
He couldn't have been
more than 5

15:10.307 --> 15:13.080
the first time I saw
his dumb face.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.792
Sweetest kid
you ever seen.

15:15.926 --> 15:17.924
I went to the store
this morning...

15:18.243 --> 15:19.917
to buy a babka,

15:20.091 --> 15:21.346
two babka,

15:21.461 --> 15:24.120
and... I saw a man there,

15:24.437 --> 15:25.956
and just for a second,

15:26.099 --> 15:27.549
I thought...

15:27.821 --> 15:29.096
Barry?

15:30.244 --> 15:32.148
But it was not him.

15:32.993 --> 15:34.166
It was not Barry.

15:34.291 --> 15:37.190
You know, he never got a
chance to apologize to me.

15:37.682 --> 15:39.353
And now...

15:40.800 --> 15:42.133
too late.

15:44.826 --> 15:47.724
So, ahem, where are we after all this?
We good?

15:47.792 --> 15:50.412
Well, to be honest...

15:50.959 --> 15:55.224
Goran is very upset you told him
to start war with Bolivians,

15:55.308 --> 15:56.391
who, PS,

15:56.458 --> 15:59.013
are just off-the-charts
nice guys.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.877
So... no matter
where you go,

16:01.954 --> 16:03.912
we will find you
and kill you.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.602
Dude...

16:06.703 --> 16:08.580
Taylor and Vaughan,
they're...

16:08.711 --> 16:11.805
They're dead,
they're fucking dead.

16:11.873 --> 16:14.458
Yeah, just relax.
Relax, okay?

16:14.526 --> 16:16.521
We just... We just...

16:16.589 --> 16:19.345
We just l-l-left
their bodies out there.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.173
What do I...
What do I do...

16:21.250 --> 16:22.679
Next time I see Vaughan's
girlfriend, huh?

16:22.746 --> 16:24.964
- What the fuck do I say?
- Don't say anything.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.418
All right?
Don't say anything.

16:26.495 --> 16:29.126
We're just gonna lay low, man.
Just be quiet, all right?

16:29.203 --> 16:30.966
- I killed a guy.
- Right.

16:31.882 --> 16:33.262
I-I...

16:33.408 --> 16:35.922
I-I-I was never...

16:35.990 --> 16:37.287
in the shit, you know?

16:37.355 --> 16:39.817
I was in logistics, okay,
logistics!

16:39.885 --> 16:41.558
I never shot anyone!

16:41.746 --> 16:43.146
Well, you had to.

16:44.099 --> 16:45.537
I didn't even want to do it.

16:45.623 --> 16:47.748
You know,
you made me do it!

16:48.198 --> 16:49.328
Chris...

16:50.406 --> 16:51.895
You need to relax.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.523
Okay?

16:57.130 --> 16:58.341
Listen, I...

17:00.259 --> 17:01.973
I think we need
to go to the cops.

17:02.224 --> 17:04.011
Jesus Christ. Okay, we
can... we can tell them

17:04.078 --> 17:05.714
that it was
self-defense.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.131
You know,
that they attacked us.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.178
Who are they gonna believe?
We're Marines, you know?

17:09.244 --> 17:11.176
We're, we're...
They're criminals!

17:11.373 --> 17:13.623
What do you think
we were doing out there?

17:14.342 --> 17:16.678
What do you think
I do for a living, Chris?

17:17.318 --> 17:18.798
The guys I work for,

17:18.919 --> 17:21.542
they're already pissed at me
because I fucked this job up.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.710
They sent a guy
out to kill me, all right?

17:23.848 --> 17:26.339
What we need to do,
is we need to relax,

17:26.451 --> 17:28.794
not do anything, lay low.
No, I can't!

17:28.871 --> 17:31.585
I can't! I cannot
live like this, okay?

17:31.662 --> 17:32.998
We could go to jail!

17:33.066 --> 17:36.154
No, the only way anyone's going to jail
is if you go to the cops, all right?

17:36.266 --> 17:37.990
These people I work for...

17:40.709 --> 17:43.669
they'll... they'll go after
your family.

17:44.591 --> 17:46.326
They'll go after
your wife.

17:47.171 --> 17:49.044
They'll go after
your kid.

17:49.513 --> 17:50.927
They'll kill them.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.693
So, I think
the best thing for us...

17:55.357 --> 17:56.771
is to be quiet...

17:57.253 --> 17:58.677
and safe.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.632
Okay, what if I just
turn myself in?

18:05.709 --> 18:07.627
They wouldn't know
anything about you.

18:07.704 --> 18:09.474
We're linked!
Nothing about you.

18:09.558 --> 18:11.474
We're linked
on Facebook, Chris.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.340
I met your wife.
You go to the cops,

18:13.417 --> 18:15.043
they'll figure it out,
they'll find me.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.508
No, they won't, because
they won't know anything!

18:17.576 --> 18:20.357
They'll find out about me, about
Fuches, about the acting class.

18:20.442 --> 18:21.544
Everyone will be dead,

18:21.612 --> 18:23.079
- Chris!
- Well, I don't fucking care,

18:23.146 --> 18:24.224
Barry!

18:24.360 --> 18:25.992
I killed a guy, okay?

18:26.060 --> 18:28.828
Now, you might be cool
with this shit, but I'm not!

18:29.320 --> 18:32.131
I got a wife
and I got a kid, okay,

18:32.208 --> 18:34.548
and... and she fucking knew,
she knew!

18:34.687 --> 18:37.633
She knew something was up
when I came home, she knew it!

18:37.945 --> 18:40.293
And then I lied to her
and I told her that I was...

18:40.378 --> 18:42.244
I was going
to the gym just now,

18:42.312 --> 18:44.111
but when I go back,
she's gonna know.

18:44.179 --> 18:46.293
She's gonna know
something is up, okay,

18:46.370 --> 18:47.750
and it's gonna come out.

18:48.797 --> 18:50.273
So that's it.

18:51.315 --> 18:52.530
That's it, okay?

18:52.598 --> 18:54.281
That's it,
I'm going to the cops,

18:54.370 --> 18:55.937
and I'm gonna
tell them everything.

18:56.005 --> 18:58.220
And if...
If I gotta do some time,

18:58.288 --> 18:59.359
fine.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.992
But I'm coming clean.

19:04.554 --> 19:06.320
Why did you say that?

19:07.594 --> 19:10.089
Why did you
Facebook me, dude?

19:10.500 --> 19:11.964
You're a fucking hit man,

19:12.041 --> 19:13.734
and then you fucking
Facebooked me?

19:13.802 --> 19:15.742
Why did you
just say that?!

19:25.337 --> 19:27.570
I told you to get out
of the car, man.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.797
You know what?

19:39.379 --> 19:40.594
It's cool.

19:42.678 --> 19:44.554
I can... keep quiet.

19:46.862 --> 19:48.133
I'm cool.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.008
And I-I didn't
tell my wife...

19:53.562 --> 19:56.258
you know, that...
that I was going to the gym.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.351
I told her that I was...

19:58.920 --> 20:00.453
coming to see you.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.671
I know you're not gonna...

20:19.412 --> 20:22.336
do anything crazy, Barry.

20:26.195 --> 20:28.031
I know you're a good guy.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.711
So, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna drop you off.

20:47.231 --> 20:49.525
And then, I am...
I am gonna keep

20:49.704 --> 20:52.590
my fat trap shut.

20:52.867 --> 20:55.465
And then, you know,
I promise you,

20:55.609 --> 20:58.445
no one will ever know
any... Wait, wait, wait!

21:25.095 --> 21:26.727
All right, hi.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.375
What a pleasure. I think there
are some seats over there.

21:30.461 --> 21:32.886
Many men making much money.
Many men making much money.

21:32.954 --> 21:35.298
Many men
making much money.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.251
Many men
making much...

21:37.328 --> 21:40.214
- money.
- Money.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.635
All right everyone,
let's focus. Bring it in.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.695
Bring it in.
All right, listen.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.531
It's two minutes
until curtain.

21:46.599 --> 21:47.625
Two minutes.

21:47.693 --> 21:50.195
It is a veritable who's who
of Hollywood out there.

21:50.438 --> 21:52.361
The "red-headed reader"
from ICM,

21:52.454 --> 21:54.804
and Daniel Meldman
from Gersh.

21:56.119 --> 21:57.203
He came?

21:57.333 --> 22:00.179
All right, now, listen.
I wish you Godspeed.

22:00.412 --> 22:01.875
I wish you courage.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.898
And no matter what happens:
Loud, fast and keep going!

22:06.002 --> 22:07.554
Hands in!
Guys.

22:07.966 --> 22:09.510
One, two, three...

22:09.585 --> 22:11.475
- Cousineau! - Cousineau!
- Cousineau! - Cousineau!

22:11.542 --> 22:13.923
Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome.

22:14.070 --> 22:16.836
Recently, our dear friend
Ryan Madison

22:16.906 --> 22:18.835
was taken away from us
too soon.

22:18.912 --> 22:20.256
Because of this,

22:20.333 --> 22:22.501
all of the proceeds
from tonight's show

22:22.569 --> 22:25.001
will go towards the fight
against violence.

22:25.116 --> 22:26.609
<i>What?</i>

22:41.709 --> 22:43.465
Alapse, poor...

22:43.542 --> 22:45.298
Fuck. Forgot my line.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.584
Cous, I'm gonna come back in.

22:48.507 --> 22:50.755
You guys, fucking Barry couldn't
be bothered to show up.

22:50.826 --> 22:52.183
I need someone to do
his stupid part.

22:52.250 --> 22:54.056
Is there any way one of you
could help me, please?

22:54.123 --> 22:56.810
We have a saying in Italy:

22:56.963 --> 22:58.935
You make-a your bed.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.302
I have supped...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.959
full with horrors.

23:14.888 --> 23:19.169
Direness, familiar to my
slaughterous thoughts!

23:20.457 --> 23:21.763
Cannot...

23:22.109 --> 23:23.317
once...

23:24.396 --> 23:25.917
start me.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.654
The Queen, My Lord,

23:42.429 --> 23:43.841
is dead.

23:47.030 --> 23:49.380
She should have died
hereafter.

23:50.458 --> 23:53.365
There would have been
a time for such a word.

23:54.395 --> 23:55.896
Tomorrow,

23:56.351 --> 23:58.263
and tomorrow,

23:58.458 --> 24:01.590
creeps in this petty pace
from day to day...

24:01.658 --> 24:04.021
No one will ever know...
Wait, wait, wait!

24:16.599 --> 24:18.154
- You're here!
- Where is everybody?

24:18.245 --> 24:19.585
And you're not in costume!

24:19.662 --> 24:20.750
Fuck it!

24:20.834 --> 24:22.498
I'm supposed to wear
a costume?

24:22.648 --> 24:23.985
We're up.

24:25.456 --> 24:27.777
Here. Here, put this
on, it's something.

24:28.852 --> 24:31.099
Come on, it's places. Now!

24:33.873 --> 24:36.748
Barry. Barry.
Look at me. Look at me.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.654
Here's what's happening.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.377
Do you see that guy
out there on his phone?

24:42.857 --> 24:45.084
That's Daniel Meldman,
from Gersh.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.857
I invited him, and he came.

24:48.255 --> 24:51.126
He was Emma Stone's agent before she
got too big for him and fired him.

24:51.263 --> 24:54.757
Look, he's here to see me, but if I
don't do well, it's over for me.

24:54.834 --> 24:56.887
He'll never sign me, I'll
never get him to work for me,

24:56.954 --> 24:59.021
and I'll certainly
never get to fire him, so...

24:59.114 --> 25:01.180
please, please, please,

25:01.245 --> 25:03.349
just give me something

25:03.417 --> 25:04.502
to work with.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.360
Can you do that?

25:08.739 --> 25:09.811
I'm sorry. What?

25:09.919 --> 25:11.115
Fuck!

25:11.671 --> 25:13.678
Just... Whatever.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.000
What?

25:18.375 --> 25:22.076
Well, Puck just took a big dump
out there. That guy sucks.

25:30.616 --> 25:34.052
I have almost forgot
the taste of fears.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.919
The time has been,
my senses would have cooled.

25:41.586 --> 25:45.216
To hear a night-shriek,
and my fell of hair...

25:46.021 --> 25:48.451
My Lord, the Queen is dead...

25:48.576 --> 25:51.155
My Lord, the Queen is dead...

25:53.893 --> 25:55.357
Fuck!

25:59.623 --> 26:01.697
My Lord, the Queen is dead.

26:03.171 --> 26:04.474
Hello?

26:06.541 --> 26:07.693
Yes.

26:10.032 --> 26:11.032
What?

26:20.655 --> 26:22.810
- Mom!
- Fuck!

26:26.762 --> 26:28.224
Stop, stop, stop.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.919
- Stop, stop.
- Mom!

26:29.996 --> 26:31.818
- Chris!
- Fuck!

26:31.903 --> 26:33.858
Yes? When?

26:34.762 --> 26:36.223
Hello?

26:37.395 --> 26:39.747
Cannot once start me.

27:05.726 --> 27:07.250
My Lord...

27:09.792 --> 27:11.664
the Queen is dead.

27:25.168 --> 27:26.418
Uh...

27:31.500 --> 27:33.882
She should have died hereafter.

27:35.607 --> 27:38.242
There would have been
a time for such a word.

27:39.099 --> 27:40.640
Tomorrow...

27:42.953 --> 27:44.772
and tomorrow,

27:45.429 --> 27:47.256
and tomorrow.

27:47.859 --> 27:49.964
Creeps in this petty pace

27:50.041 --> 27:51.465
from day to day,

27:51.542 --> 27:54.126
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

27:54.804 --> 27:56.083
Atta girl.

27:56.166 --> 27:59.343
And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools...

27:59.976 --> 28:01.976
the way to dusty death.

28:04.208 --> 28:05.542
Out.

28:07.231 --> 28:09.296
Out, brief candle.

28:09.867 --> 28:12.765
Life's but a walking shadow...

28:15.208 --> 28:18.919
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage,

28:18.996 --> 28:21.000
and then is heard no more.

28:24.343 --> 28:27.406
It is a tale told by an idiot,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.070
full of sound and fury...

28:32.783 --> 28:35.000
signifying nothing.

28:39.997 --> 28:41.860
<i>Bravo!</i>

28:43.558 --> 28:45.343
<i>Whoo!</i>

28:48.625 --> 28:50.488
<i>Whoo!</i>

28:52.416 --> 28:53.823
<i>Yeah!</i>

29:08.073 --> 29:09.281
Barry!

29:10.020 --> 29:11.812
Bravo!

29:12.083 --> 29:14.450
I just saw you
go to a place tonight

29:14.518 --> 29:16.131
I have never seen before.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.511
I don't know if you can
do it again,

29:17.578 --> 29:20.426
but it was amaz...

29:22.764 --> 29:25.919
Okay, I see you're
still in that place.

29:25.987 --> 29:27.752
I'm going to leave you
to your process.

29:27.829 --> 29:30.167
You know,
I have a few notes.

29:31.620 --> 29:33.268
They can wait
till Monday.

30:03.350 --> 30:04.850
Sasha!

30:17.851 --> 30:19.520
<i>- That'll work for me.
- Really?</i>

30:19.644 --> 30:22.046
Yeah. I'll tell you what.
Why don't you...

30:22.226 --> 30:24.343
give me a call,
and we'll set up a meeting.

30:24.539 --> 30:26.466
All right?
I will.

30:26.583 --> 30:27.648
Thank you!
You're welcome.

30:27.716 --> 30:29.070
Thank you so much.
Thank you for coming.

30:29.137 --> 30:30.171
You bet.

30:33.674 --> 30:35.180
Oh, my God, Barry.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.089
Daniel Meldman, from Gersh.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.590
He told me to call him.

30:38.667 --> 30:41.697
He said, he said, he said, "There's
a lot to work with there."

30:43.140 --> 30:45.257
Barry, thank you.

30:45.390 --> 30:47.210
Thank you
for doing that for me.

30:47.287 --> 30:49.500
Oh, my God,
that was amazing!

30:49.625 --> 30:51.173
I didn't even have to act!

30:51.250 --> 30:53.126
You just gave it to me,
everything I needed.

30:53.203 --> 30:54.921
God, you were so...

30:55.435 --> 30:56.732
generous.

30:57.802 --> 30:59.617
That was acting, Barry.

31:00.354 --> 31:01.980
You are a real actor.

31:02.523 --> 31:03.531
I am?

31:03.608 --> 31:04.736
Yes!

31:04.804 --> 31:06.041
I mean...

31:06.125 --> 31:07.720
whatever you did tonight
to get to that place,

31:07.787 --> 31:09.126
that's your new process, okay?

31:09.203 --> 31:11.335
All you have to do
is do that every time.

31:12.778 --> 31:14.781
I'm gonna go change.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.765
We're all going for drinks.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.367
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

31:18.435 --> 31:19.851
Thank you, Barry.
