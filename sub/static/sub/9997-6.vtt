00:11.735 --> 00:15.237
<i>We can cast off the shackles
of our daily lives.</i>

00:16.540 --> 00:19.542
<i>We can go anywhere
we want to go.</i>

00:23.179 --> 00:25.614
<i>We can be any version
of ourselves</i>

00:25.682 --> 00:27.616
<i>That we want to be.</i>

00:27.684 --> 00:30.619
<i>I'm not saying that isn't true.</i>

00:30.687 --> 00:33.756
<i>Who am I to contradict
a college textbook?</i>

00:33.823 --> 00:36.759
<i>But any schoolkid can tell you</i>

00:36.826 --> 00:39.595
<i>That there is one thing
you can't do in your dreams.</i>

00:40.664 --> 00:42.831
<i>(alarm ringing)
you can't die.</i>

00:44.868 --> 00:47.036
<i>According to just
about every schoolkid</i>

00:47.103 --> 00:48.871
<i>Who's ever lived--</i>

00:48.939 --> 00:50.973
<i>If you actually die
in your dream,</i>

00:51.041 --> 00:53.208
<i>You'll die in real life, too.</i>

00:53.276 --> 00:55.878
<i>We laugh at that idea
as we get older.</i>

00:55.946 --> 00:57.913
<i>But I wonder sometimes:</i>

00:57.981 --> 01:00.215
<i>Can we ever be absolutely sure</i>

01:00.283 --> 01:03.252
<i>That those kids are wrong?</i>

01:03.320 --> 01:07.256
<i>I mean, if your dream
does kill you,</i>

01:07.324 --> 01:09.625
<i>You're not around to talk
about it, right?</i>

01:09.693 --> 01:11.794
<i>They'll call it a heart attack.</i>

01:11.861 --> 01:15.164
<i>They'll say you died
in your sleep.</i>

01:15.231 --> 01:17.733
<i>They'll never know
what actually happened</i>

01:17.801 --> 01:21.103
<i>Is that your worst nightmare
finally caught up with you.</i>

01:24.407 --> 01:26.342
(sighs)

01:26.409 --> 01:27.676
You okay?

01:27.744 --> 01:29.678
You all right?
(sighs)

01:29.746 --> 01:31.680
Actually, I'm dead.

01:31.748 --> 01:33.682
(sighs)

01:33.750 --> 01:35.351
Well, get some
more sleep.

01:35.418 --> 01:37.419
You'll feel
better.
Mm.

01:38.421 --> 01:40.422

<i>They're coming to get you,
Barbara.</i>

02:30.959 --> 02:32.560
Stop it.

02:32.627 --> 02:33.961
You're ignorant.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.764
They're coming
for you, barbara.

02:36.832 --> 02:39.066
Look! There comes
one of them now.

02:39.134 --> 02:40.234
Cool.

02:40.302 --> 02:42.703
They really were
coming for her.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.338
Johnny: I'm getting out of here.
Barbara: Johnny!

02:47.642 --> 02:50.478
(barbara screaming)

02:50.545 --> 02:52.379
Johnny!

02:52.447 --> 02:54.415
Help me!

02:54.483 --> 02:56.083
Hey, where you goin'?

02:56.151 --> 02:57.751
You're not afraid,
are you?

02:57.819 --> 02:59.186
Hey, what're you watching
over there?

02:59.254 --> 03:01.222
It sounds pretty scary
for a Sunday morning.

03:01.289 --> 03:04.058
<i>It's some old movie called
night of the living dead.</i>

03:04.126 --> 03:06.794
It's part of a zombie
movie marathon

03:06.862 --> 03:08.829
That's going to be on
until Halloween.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.997
They're not running the one

03:10.065 --> 03:11.398
Where everyone gets
trapped in the mall,

03:11.466 --> 03:12.433
Are they?
Ariel: Bridgette!

03:12.501 --> 03:15.169
I am going to
kill you!

03:15.237 --> 03:17.004
Mom!

03:17.072 --> 03:18.472
Make her come and
get this thing

03:18.540 --> 03:20.908
Out of here!

03:20.976 --> 03:22.643
Bridgette, I mean it!

03:22.711 --> 03:25.479
Get in here
before I flush this thing!

03:25.547 --> 03:26.714
That thing has a name.

03:26.781 --> 03:27.815
Miss scarlet.

03:27.883 --> 03:30.117
I don't care what your
stupid science class

03:30.185 --> 03:32.720
Decided to call
their stupid pet.

03:32.787 --> 03:34.288
Get it out of here. Now!

03:34.356 --> 03:35.890
Bridgette, I thought
you told me

03:35.957 --> 03:37.892
You were going to keep
miss scarlet in your room.

03:37.959 --> 03:40.761
I know, but miss colletto
said tarantulas do better

03:40.829 --> 03:42.796
In humid environments

03:42.864 --> 03:44.798
Like a bathroom
or a basement.

03:44.866 --> 03:46.800
And it's not like I was
going to keep her in here.

03:46.868 --> 03:48.335
Humid. Huh.

03:48.403 --> 03:50.838
How do you think she'll feel
at the bottom of the toilet?

03:50.906 --> 03:52.673
(phone rings)
ariel, relax.
Bridgette, hey.

03:52.741 --> 03:54.508
Bring miss scarlet
back into your room.

03:54.576 --> 03:57.578
You can bring her in here when
it's your turn to take a bath.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.582
Scanlon.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.584
He does know
it's Sunday, right?

04:03.652 --> 04:05.586
Hey. What's going on?

04:05.654 --> 04:07.588
Hey, I know it's the weekend,
but I was wondering

04:07.656 --> 04:09.356
If there's any way you could
give me a hand with something.

04:09.424 --> 04:11.659
I got kind of a situation.

04:11.726 --> 04:14.628
What kind of situation?

04:14.696 --> 04:16.630
You're damn right,
I'm upset.

04:16.697 --> 04:18.298
Something bad has
happened to him,

04:18.366 --> 04:20.166
And you people
don't seem to care.

04:20.235 --> 04:22.670
This is a man
who has given discounts

04:22.737 --> 04:24.371
To the policemen
and firemen

04:24.439 --> 04:27.374
For as long as he's been
in business.

04:27.442 --> 04:29.210
He's even buried a few men
for free

04:29.277 --> 04:32.046
When he realized that the
families couldn't afford it.

04:32.113 --> 04:34.381
And now that he needs you,

04:34.449 --> 04:37.151
All I hear is, it's too soon

04:37.219 --> 04:39.653
To file a missing
persons report.
Ma'am,

04:39.721 --> 04:42.656
The person who answered your
call obviously wasn't aware

04:42.724 --> 04:44.291
Of your father's special
relationship

04:44.359 --> 04:45.426
With the department.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.094
Which is why we're
here to assure you

04:47.162 --> 04:48.696
That this is being
taken seriously.

04:48.763 --> 04:51.065
We're doing everything
we can to find your father.

04:51.132 --> 04:51.699
Now, do you think
it's possible

04:51.700 --> 04:53.267
Th

04:53.335 --> 04:55.102
That he may have just slipped
away without telling you?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.770
Maybe taken some time off?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.772
You haven't heard a word
I've said, have you?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.274
He's not taking time off.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.508
He doesn't take time off.

05:01.576 --> 05:02.977
"time off" is not
in my father's dna.

05:03.044 --> 05:05.412
This is a man who lives to work.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.580
Period.

05:06.648 --> 05:09.283
He's been running
this place for 40 years.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.618
And as far as I know,

05:10.685 --> 05:12.620
The only time
he's taken time off

05:12.687 --> 05:14.455
Was the morning that I was born.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.956
And that was only
because my mother

05:16.024 --> 05:17.725
Threatened to kill him
if he didn't.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.195
Okay, well...

05:21.263 --> 05:23.197
Along those same lines,
did he have any enemies?

05:23.265 --> 05:24.832
Anyone who may have
wished him harm?

05:25.867 --> 05:28.802
Ten, twelve years ago,

05:28.870 --> 05:31.272
I would've said "no."

05:31.339 --> 05:34.041
He was always
a very loved man.

05:34.109 --> 05:37.044
He was the president of the
chamber of commerce three times.

05:37.112 --> 05:38.779
He always sponsored
a little league team.

05:38.847 --> 05:41.248
<i>He loved
this neighborhood.</i>

05:41.316 --> 05:43.917
(sighs)
I think that's why
he was so upset

05:43.985 --> 05:46.920
When he started to see it change
with the drugs

05:46.988 --> 05:49.757
And the crime and the dealers...

05:49.824 --> 05:52.259
The gangs.

05:52.327 --> 05:55.262
You know, daddy's never been shy
about his opinion

05:55.330 --> 05:57.264
With regard to the state
of things around here.

05:57.332 --> 06:00.367
And on more than one occasion,

06:00.435 --> 06:01.402
He's had words with

06:01.469 --> 06:02.569
The drug dealers.

06:02.637 --> 06:04.271
Who knows?
Maybe...

06:04.339 --> 06:07.274
One of them, finally just, um...

06:07.342 --> 06:09.143
Just got rid of him.

06:09.210 --> 06:11.278
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

06:11.346 --> 06:14.281
I have two funerals
this morning.

06:14.349 --> 06:16.350
The dead don't like
to be kept waiting.

06:20.055 --> 06:21.855
(sighs): Yikes.

06:21.923 --> 06:25.693
Okay, here's the plan.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.696
I put miss scarlet on the tip
of ariel's toothbrush

06:28.763 --> 06:30.030
And you take a picture.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.199
And then,
once ariel's done

06:32.267 --> 06:34.635
Brushing her teeth,
we show her the picture.

06:34.703 --> 06:37.071
Your spider looks funny
when he's sleeping.

06:37.138 --> 06:38.105
(laughing): Okay,

06:38.173 --> 06:40.107
First of all, it's not a spider,

06:40.175 --> 06:41.442
It's a tarantula.

06:41.509 --> 06:43.944
Second of all, it's not a he,
it's a she.

06:44.012 --> 06:47.281
And third of all,
tarantulas don't sleep.

06:47.349 --> 06:49.283
Well, this one does.

06:49.351 --> 06:51.352
What?

06:54.889 --> 06:56.924
(ominous soundtrack playing)

06:59.894 --> 07:01.829
What did
miss colletto say?

07:01.896 --> 07:02.863
Was she mad?

07:02.931 --> 07:04.865
No, sweetie, she wasn't mad.

07:04.933 --> 07:06.367
Nobody's mad.

07:06.434 --> 07:09.136
Well, she was just sorry it took
her so long to call us back.

07:09.204 --> 07:11.505
She wanted to make sure that
you don't worry about it.

07:11.573 --> 07:14.541
She said there's no way
of knowing how old
miss scarlet was,

07:14.609 --> 07:17.845
And it was probably
just her time.

07:17.912 --> 07:19.913
That isn't your fault.

07:21.950 --> 07:23.884
I think I'm just
going to go to bed.

07:23.952 --> 07:25.719
Hey, I thought we were going
to finish this together.

07:25.787 --> 07:28.455
Yeah, well,
you can finish it without me.

07:28.523 --> 07:30.524
I'm just not in the mood
anymore.

07:32.861 --> 07:34.294
Hmm.

07:34.362 --> 07:36.130
Did miss colletto
happen to mention

07:36.197 --> 07:39.032
What we were supposed to do with
the spectacular spider remains?

07:39.100 --> 07:42.102
Apparently,
miss scarlet is flushable.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.370
Burial at sea.

07:43.438 --> 07:46.507
Excellent.
What about the terrarium?

07:46.574 --> 07:48.575
Well, she said if we
don't have any use for it,

07:48.643 --> 07:50.110
We can just
throw it away.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.279
Seems that she has more than
she needs in her classroom.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.782
Mmm, dead tarantulas,

07:54.849 --> 07:56.817
Flesh-eating zombies,

07:56.885 --> 07:59.853
And a missing
funeral parlor director.

07:59.921 --> 08:02.856
Halloween isn't exactly
being subtle this year.

08:02.924 --> 08:05.359
(thunder rumbling)

08:14.436 --> 08:15.636
Hey, come on, barb.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.204
Church was this morning, huh?

08:17.272 --> 08:19.206
I'm sorry.

08:19.274 --> 08:21.208
Was that you who just
said something to me?

08:21.276 --> 08:23.877
And did you say it
in black and white?

08:23.945 --> 08:26.380
Hey, I mean, praying's
for church, huh?

08:26.448 --> 08:27.915
Come on.

08:27.982 --> 08:28.949
Wait, back up.

08:29.017 --> 08:30.951
Did you just call me
"barb"?

08:31.019 --> 08:33.953
My name's allison.

08:34.022 --> 08:35.456
And I'm not sure I like

08:35.523 --> 08:37.825
What this black and white
is doing to my skin.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.893
(thunder crashing)

08:41.895 --> 08:44.097
Do you remember one time,
when we were small,

08:44.164 --> 08:46.099
We were out here?

08:46.167 --> 08:47.768
It was from right over there.

08:47.836 --> 08:49.803
I jumped out at you
from behind a tree,

08:49.871 --> 08:52.473
And grandpa got all excited
and he shook his fist at me

08:52.540 --> 08:55.476
And he said, "boy, you'll
be damned to hell." (chuckles)

08:55.543 --> 08:58.011
Well, you used to really
be scared here.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.014
This is really freaky.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.016
Hey, you're still afraid.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.085
(thunder rumbling)

09:08.990 --> 09:11.959
(Ã  la vincent price):
They're coming to
get you, barbara.

09:12.026 --> 09:13.961
You've got to stop calling me
barbara!

09:14.028 --> 09:15.295
My name is allison!

09:15.363 --> 09:17.798
Even though this is a dream,
my name is allison!

09:17.866 --> 09:20.834
They're coming
for you, barbara.

09:20.902 --> 09:22.002
Johnny: Look!

09:22.070 --> 09:24.238
There comes one
of them now.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.245
(barbara screaming)

09:36.751 --> 09:38.752
(thunder rumbling)

09:50.732 --> 09:53.000
(head thumps on headstone)

09:53.067 --> 09:54.868
(gasping)

09:59.874 --> 10:01.975
(gasping)

10:02.043 --> 10:03.443
(thunder rumbling)

10:03.511 --> 10:04.678
(softly groaning)

10:10.919 --> 10:12.352
(panting)

10:12.420 --> 10:13.554
Don't worry.

10:13.621 --> 10:15.622
You're going to wake up soon.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.060
(panting)

10:25.133 --> 10:26.900
Hey, is that your house?

10:26.968 --> 10:28.936
I need to get inside!
We both really

10:29.003 --> 10:30.337
Need to get inside...

10:30.405 --> 10:32.406
(screams)

10:35.410 --> 10:37.411
(panting)

10:41.916 --> 10:45.085
(screaming)

10:45.153 --> 10:46.753
(gasps, screams)

10:46.821 --> 10:48.755
Hey, what's
going on?

10:48.823 --> 10:50.057
You all right?
(sighs)

10:51.192 --> 10:52.392
Yeah, nothing.

10:52.460 --> 10:53.660
It's a nightmare.

10:53.728 --> 10:54.795
It's just a nightmare.

10:54.862 --> 10:55.862
Sorry, honey.

10:55.930 --> 10:57.631
Go back to sleep.

10:59.233 --> 11:00.701
What? Allison?

11:00.768 --> 11:02.603
What did you do
to your arm?

11:02.670 --> 11:04.905
Oh, my god.

11:09.015 --> 11:11.684
I just don't understand
how this happened.

11:11.751 --> 11:13.118
I was having a dream,

11:13.186 --> 11:16.455
A weird, old
zombie movie dream.

11:18.124 --> 11:19.658
Well, I mean...

11:19.726 --> 11:22.962
If you were dreaming,
you weren't, like, in control.

11:23.029 --> 11:24.997
I mean, you just,
like, grabbed yourself--

11:25.065 --> 11:27.032
You grabbed your arm,
and you scratched yourself up.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.567
Really ripped the skin.

11:28.635 --> 11:31.070
But, you know,
it's not that unusual.

11:31.137 --> 11:32.538
Had a roommate
in college

11:32.606 --> 11:35.140
Who used to throw
punches in his sleep.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.609
I sometimes grind my teeth.

11:36.676 --> 11:38.711
I mean, it's not like
you went in the garage

11:38.778 --> 11:40.746
And, like, started up
the skill saw.

11:40.814 --> 11:42.681
I mean, you scratched
yourself.

11:42.749 --> 11:44.416
You scratched the crap
out of yourself,

11:44.484 --> 11:46.318
But still...

11:48.021 --> 11:49.021
Okay.

11:49.089 --> 11:50.522
VoilÃ .

11:50.590 --> 11:51.924
(siren wailing)

11:51.992 --> 11:53.192
Scanlon:
Groundskeeper found
bobbi catalano's dad

11:53.260 --> 11:55.761
A little over
an hour ago.

11:55.829 --> 11:57.997
Forensics thinks he was killed
out there by those graves,

11:58.064 --> 12:00.132
Then dragged in here
and out of sight.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.600
Wallet and
watch are gone.

12:01.668 --> 12:03.502
Car is still parked
in the parking lot.

12:03.570 --> 12:06.472
Do we have any idea
what he was doing out here?

12:06.539 --> 12:07.773
Given his profession,
you'd think

12:07.841 --> 12:08.908
It might have
been work-related,

12:08.975 --> 12:10.276
But, uh, apparently,

12:10.343 --> 12:13.312
One of those headstones over
there belongs to his wife.

12:13.380 --> 12:15.381
Best guess is,
he was visiting her

12:15.448 --> 12:16.815
When someone jumped him.

12:16.883 --> 12:19.018
Smashed his head in with a
stone and emptied his pockets.

12:19.085 --> 12:22.688
It's kind of a strange place
for a mugging, don't you think?

12:22.756 --> 12:24.623
Well, yes and no.

12:24.691 --> 12:27.159
It's quiet, isolated.

12:27.227 --> 12:29.428
If you yell for help, there's
no one around to hear

12:29.496 --> 12:30.863
Except for a bunch
of dead people.

12:30.931 --> 12:31.997
(sighs)

12:32.065 --> 12:33.532
Feel free to take
a look around

12:33.600 --> 12:35.868
And see if you
get anything.

12:35.936 --> 12:37.336
I'm going to go
call ms. Catalano

12:37.404 --> 12:39.071
And let her know
we found her dad.

12:39.139 --> 12:41.173
(static crackles,
garbled radio chatter)

12:43.076 --> 12:45.144
(crow cawing)

12:45.211 --> 12:47.212
(man coughing)

13:02.095 --> 13:03.729
Allison:
Sir?

13:07.467 --> 13:09.168
Sir.

13:13.039 --> 13:15.107
Sir, are you all right?

13:16.476 --> 13:18.277
(screaming)

13:18.345 --> 13:19.345
Scanlon:
Allison.

13:19.412 --> 13:20.646
(coughing)

13:22.115 --> 13:23.582
What the hell
is going on?

13:23.650 --> 13:25.551
(stammers)

13:26.586 --> 13:27.987
(coughing)

13:28.054 --> 13:29.088
Allison, go for help.

13:29.155 --> 13:30.556
Get them to call
an ambulance.

13:30.623 --> 13:32.758
(school bell ringing)

13:32.826 --> 13:37.262
The mesozoic era is often called
the age of the reptiles.

13:37.330 --> 13:40.232
Reptiles were the dominant form
of life on earth

13:40.300 --> 13:43.035
For the entire era,
which lasted...

13:43.103 --> 13:44.870
(girl clearing throat)

13:44.938 --> 13:46.939
...Almost 200 million years.

13:48.375 --> 13:52.044
The mesozoic era is divided
into three distinct periods.

13:52.112 --> 13:54.179
(screaming)

13:55.448 --> 13:56.648
Bridgette?

13:56.716 --> 13:57.716
(students laughing)

13:57.784 --> 13:58.917
Are you all right?

14:04.324 --> 14:06.325
Hi, kiddo.

14:07.394 --> 14:08.627
No hello?

14:08.695 --> 14:10.362
Is everything okay?

14:10.430 --> 14:12.998
I think miss scarlet's
mad at me.

14:13.066 --> 14:14.533
Miss scarlet?

14:14.601 --> 14:16.168
The spider?

14:16.236 --> 14:17.703
I don't think that's
possible, honey.

14:17.771 --> 14:20.305
Uh, I was there when
miss scarlet was fl...

14:21.541 --> 14:24.476
Laid to rest,
and I don't think she can be mad

14:24.544 --> 14:26.178
At anyone or anything
at this point.

14:26.246 --> 14:28.013
Yeah, well,
I think she can.

14:28.081 --> 14:29.715
And I think she is.

14:29.783 --> 14:31.116
And I deserve it.

14:31.184 --> 14:32.518
Why?

14:34.187 --> 14:36.155
Because I gave her some candy.

14:36.222 --> 14:38.023
What?

14:38.091 --> 14:40.526
I fed her some candy.

14:40.593 --> 14:43.362
I put some candy in her cage,

14:43.430 --> 14:45.697
Just to see if she'd like it.

14:47.267 --> 14:49.468
I think that's why she died.

14:49.536 --> 14:51.070
Woman (over p.A.):
Paging dr. Stateman.

14:51.137 --> 14:53.138
Scanlon:
His name's edgar kripke.

14:53.206 --> 14:55.507
According to social services,
he's a drug addict

14:55.575 --> 14:57.009
And a paranoid
schizophrenic.

14:57.077 --> 14:59.278
When he couldn't get a bed at
the local homeless shelter,

14:59.345 --> 15:00.512
He'd sleep in
that cemetery.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.681
Bobbi catalano told
me that kripke

15:02.749 --> 15:04.850
Had actually had words
with her father before.

15:04.918 --> 15:07.119
I guess her dad wasn't
too happy that this guy

15:07.187 --> 15:09.621
Was crashing a few hundred
yards from his wife's grave.

15:09.689 --> 15:11.490
Carl actually called
the police on him once.

15:11.558 --> 15:12.825
Had him arrested
for vagrancy.

15:12.892 --> 15:14.726
But that doesn't prove
that he...

15:14.794 --> 15:17.329
We searched the cardboard
box that kripke calls home.

15:17.397 --> 15:20.332
Found carl's wallet
in there and his watch.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.468
Well, what about the blood
around his mouth?

15:22.535 --> 15:23.902
And the groaning?

15:23.970 --> 15:25.370
Drug overdose.

15:25.438 --> 15:27.573
He must have just gotten
high when you spotted him.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.842
His doctor says it caused
some serious brain damage.

15:29.909 --> 15:31.610
What kind of drug
does that?

15:31.678 --> 15:34.513
You ever heard of
something called "wet"?

15:34.581 --> 15:37.583
Cigarettes soaked in methanol,
formaldehyde and ethanol.

15:37.650 --> 15:38.951
It's a hallucinogen.
Believe it or not,

15:39.018 --> 15:40.185
There's actually
demand for this stuff.

15:40.253 --> 15:42.187
The government's been
trying to make it harder

15:42.255 --> 15:43.789
For the people who
cook this stuff up

15:43.857 --> 15:45.190
To get their hands
on the ingredients,

15:45.258 --> 15:47.259
But we just keep seeing
more and more of it.

15:47.327 --> 15:49.628
So, what, this guy
just fried his brain?

15:49.696 --> 15:52.431
We're never going to get him
to admit what he did.
It's okay.

15:52.499 --> 15:54.633
I think we got enough to
pin this murder on kripke,

15:54.701 --> 15:56.068
Whether he ever
talks again or not.

15:57.871 --> 15:59.271
I don't know
exactly what it was

15:59.339 --> 16:01.206
That drew your attention
to this deadbeat, but, uh,

16:01.274 --> 16:03.709
I'm glad it happened.

16:03.776 --> 16:07.613
At least now we got some
answers for carl's daughter.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.214
So, bridgette thinks
she's being haunted

16:09.282 --> 16:10.449
By that dead spider?

16:10.517 --> 16:11.984
Yes, indeedy.

16:12.051 --> 16:13.685
So, what did you
tell her?

16:13.753 --> 16:15.220
I suggested she
talk to her teacher

16:15.288 --> 16:17.856
And tell her that she fed
candy to the class pet.

16:17.924 --> 16:19.558
Well, how is that
going to help?

16:19.626 --> 16:21.493
Well, she's obviously got
a guilty conscience,

16:21.561 --> 16:23.195
Not to mention an
overactive imagination,

16:23.263 --> 16:25.197
So I just figured if
she confessed, then...

16:25.265 --> 16:26.398
Okay, I get that.

16:26.466 --> 16:28.267
I mean, you've been
at this for a while.

16:28.334 --> 16:30.035
Have you ever communed
with any dead insects?

16:30.103 --> 16:31.270
Well, now that
you mention it,

16:31.337 --> 16:34.873
I'm going to have to add
that to my to-do list.

16:36.409 --> 16:38.443
Male reporter (over tv):
...Reports, incredible
as they seem,

16:38.511 --> 16:40.913
Are not the results
of mass hysteria.

16:40.980 --> 16:43.015
A wave of murder,
which is sweeping

16:43.082 --> 16:46.418
The eastern third of the nation,
is being committed by creatures

16:46.486 --> 16:49.655
Who feast upon the flesh
of their victims.

16:49.722 --> 16:52.424
I think we have some late word
just arriving.

16:52.492 --> 16:55.127
This is the latest disclosure
in a report

16:55.195 --> 16:58.197
From national civil defense
headquarters in washington.

16:58.264 --> 17:01.466
"it has been established that
persons who have recently died

17:01.534 --> 17:05.304
Have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder."

17:05.371 --> 17:06.872
(loud hammering)

17:06.940 --> 17:09.741
"widespread investigation
of reports from funeral homes,

17:09.809 --> 17:11.944
"morgues and hospitals
has concluded

17:12.011 --> 17:15.681
"that the unburied dead
are coming back to life

17:15.748 --> 17:17.848
And seeking human victims."

17:20.053 --> 17:22.054
(hammering continues)

17:32.165 --> 17:33.665
Hello?

17:35.435 --> 17:36.735
(gasps, then sighs)

17:36.803 --> 17:38.103
Joe.

17:38.171 --> 17:39.605
Oh, my god.

17:39.672 --> 17:41.206
What are you doing here?

17:41.274 --> 17:42.474
I'm sorry. My name's not joe.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.543
It's dale. It's dale cosgrove.

17:44.611 --> 17:46.011
Don't you remember?

17:47.046 --> 17:48.914
I saved you from
that creature

17:48.982 --> 17:51.183
Who was trying
to get in here.

17:51.251 --> 17:52.818
You fell down,
and you hit your head.

17:52.885 --> 17:55.287
We put you on the couch
so you could sleep it off.

17:55.355 --> 17:57.256
But now you're up,
I could use your help.

17:57.323 --> 17:59.124
I mean, if you're
feeling up to it.

17:59.192 --> 18:00.759
And that creature
who attacked you--

18:00.827 --> 18:03.295
He's got a lot of friends.

18:03.363 --> 18:05.731
Pretty sure
they're coming back.

18:07.934 --> 18:09.001
Hey.

18:09.068 --> 18:11.169
I know what I'm
talking about.

18:11.237 --> 18:12.604
My family and I
were on the interstate,

18:12.672 --> 18:14.039
And we saw a whole bunch
of them.

18:14.107 --> 18:15.707
I slowed down.
It was dark.

18:15.775 --> 18:18.210
I didn't realize what
they were at first.

18:18.278 --> 18:20.379
And before I knew
what was happening...

18:20.446 --> 18:23.015
One of them
got my wife's door open,

18:23.082 --> 18:25.050
And he... He pulled her
out of the truck,

18:25.118 --> 18:27.919
And they all began biting
at her,

18:27.987 --> 18:30.355
Ripping at her flesh
with their teeth.

18:30.423 --> 18:32.090
That's horrible.

18:32.158 --> 18:33.625
So, we found
your house,

18:33.693 --> 18:37.029
And... Hope you don't mind
that we set up camp here.

18:37.096 --> 18:38.997
It... It's fine with me.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.365
It's not my house.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.434
I-I don't know
whose house it is.

18:44.003 --> 18:45.804
Daddy?

18:46.839 --> 18:49.107
My daughters.

18:49.175 --> 18:51.643
That's abigail,
mabel and bella.

18:51.711 --> 18:53.612
I'm sorry-- I didn't
catch your name.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.813
(sighs)

18:54.881 --> 18:56.915
I'm allison.

18:59.085 --> 19:02.387
I'm allison dubois.

19:02.455 --> 19:04.189
Daddy, I know you told us
to stay in the basement,

19:04.257 --> 19:05.257
But that man is getting worse.

19:05.325 --> 19:06.258
There's a man?

19:06.326 --> 19:07.259
What man?

19:07.327 --> 19:08.560
Someone else is here?

19:08.628 --> 19:10.228
We found him
on the way.

19:10.296 --> 19:12.097
We saved him from a pack
of those things.

19:12.165 --> 19:14.433
They were... They were
biting him and clawing at him,

19:14.500 --> 19:16.168
So we brought him with us.

19:16.235 --> 19:17.502
Girls, go to the kitchen.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.737
Get him some water.

19:18.805 --> 19:20.639
See if he'll
take a drink.

19:22.775 --> 19:24.242
We got to board
this place up,

19:24.310 --> 19:26.144
Wait it out until the police

19:26.212 --> 19:27.979
Or the national guard
can come get us.

19:28.047 --> 19:30.816
I think, if we can make
it till morning...

19:30.883 --> 19:32.451
(grunts)

19:32.518 --> 19:33.952
...We'll be okay.
Bridgette/bella:
They're back, daddy!

19:34.020 --> 19:35.387
A whole bunch of them!

19:35.455 --> 19:37.022
You can see them
through the window!

19:44.430 --> 19:45.697
Damn it.

19:45.765 --> 19:47.532
We're going to need more wood.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.867
And fast.

19:50.703 --> 19:52.704
Look for old furniture.

19:52.772 --> 19:55.674
Anything we can break
into more boards.

20:15.661 --> 20:16.995
Hey.

20:17.063 --> 20:18.897
Come on.
What are you staring at?

20:18.965 --> 20:20.065
We have work to do.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.299
I-I'm sorry.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.769
I... I...
I know him.

20:23.836 --> 20:26.805
We kind of come from
the same place.

20:30.042 --> 20:32.177
Oh, my god.

20:34.781 --> 20:36.148
He's not breathing.

20:36.215 --> 20:38.150
Dale:
Hey, come on down there!

20:38.217 --> 20:39.418
We need some wood!
Here.

20:39.485 --> 20:40.786
Here, you take this.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.754
I'll look for more.

20:56.402 --> 20:58.403
(suspenseful horror movie
music plays)

21:00.940 --> 21:02.274
(screaming)

21:07.680 --> 21:09.247
No, no.

21:09.315 --> 21:11.249
(whimpers,
screams)

21:11.317 --> 21:12.584
Ow!

21:12.652 --> 21:13.685
Yeah?

21:13.753 --> 21:15.587
Al, what is it?
What's wrong?

21:16.622 --> 21:18.557
(groaning)

21:18.624 --> 21:20.158
Joe:
Oh, my god.

21:24.036 --> 21:25.503
Mr. Dubois?

21:28.173 --> 21:30.107
Hi... Doctor.

21:30.175 --> 21:31.409
How's my wife?

21:31.476 --> 21:32.643
Uh, she'll be fine.

21:32.711 --> 21:34.145
Uh, we dressed
her wound,

21:34.212 --> 21:36.981
But I'm not sure that's
what we should call it.

21:37.049 --> 21:38.149
What do you mean?

21:38.216 --> 21:39.951
Well, once we rinsed
all the blood away...

21:40.018 --> 21:43.187
You know, her skin is...

21:43.255 --> 21:45.222
It's raw, it's inflamed.

21:45.290 --> 21:47.124
Uh, there's clearly bruising.

21:47.192 --> 21:49.293
And it certainly seems
for all the world

21:49.361 --> 21:50.761
Like she's been bitten.

21:50.829 --> 21:52.997
The only thing is,
there's no broken skin,

21:53.065 --> 21:55.533
No teeth marks,
no actual trauma.

21:55.601 --> 21:58.102
How's that possible?

21:58.170 --> 21:59.503
Well, one possibility,

21:59.571 --> 22:02.373
And the only possibility
I can think of is,

22:02.441 --> 22:05.276
There's a phenomenon
known as psychosomatic bruising.

22:05.344 --> 22:07.211
In very rare cases,

22:07.279 --> 22:10.381
A patient sometimes
can injure themselves.

22:12.751 --> 22:15.019
I don't think
that's possible in this case

22:15.087 --> 22:17.955
'cause the bite was on the back
of her calf, so I...

22:18.023 --> 22:20.291
Oh, the wounds wouldn't have
been caused by physical trauma.

22:20.359 --> 22:23.561
The belief is, they're generated
by the patient's mind.

22:23.629 --> 22:26.631
The injuries are a subconscious
physiological response

22:26.698 --> 22:28.499
To extreme stress.

22:28.567 --> 22:30.801
The theory is
that your emotional state

22:30.869 --> 22:32.937
Can cause your blood vessels
to engorge.

22:33.005 --> 22:34.538
And if it's bad enough,

22:34.606 --> 22:37.008
You could actually bleed
right through your pores.

22:37.075 --> 22:38.676
Now, you know,
your wife did say

22:38.744 --> 22:41.712
That she's, uh, been having
nightmares, so I thought

22:41.780 --> 22:43.814
Maybe all she needs
is a couple nights

22:43.882 --> 22:46.117
Of uninterrupted sleep.

22:46.184 --> 22:48.019
So, here's a prescription
for sleeping pills,

22:48.086 --> 22:51.722
And, uh, beyond that...

22:51.790 --> 22:53.090
That doesn't make much sense.

22:53.158 --> 22:54.925
<i>She wants me to get more sleep?</i>

22:54.993 --> 22:56.794
Hey, look, I don't
know, you know?

22:56.862 --> 22:58.729
She seemed to think
that, you know,

22:58.797 --> 23:00.398
A night of uninterrupted
sleep was...

23:00.465 --> 23:02.933
Wait. I don't think
she gets this.

23:03.001 --> 23:06.170
<i>I don't think I could survive
a night of uninterrupted sleep.</i>

23:06.238 --> 23:07.838
I mean, think about it.

23:07.906 --> 23:10.908
Even if she's right, even if
I'm doing this to myself,

23:10.976 --> 23:13.778
I'm still getting hurt.

23:13.845 --> 23:16.914
I dream that I get hurt,
I wake up, and I'm hurt.

23:16.982 --> 23:20.418
What if my next dream,
I dream that I break my leg,

23:20.485 --> 23:22.620
Or what if I die in my dream?

23:22.688 --> 23:25.256
Die? You don't think that
could happen, do you?

23:27.793 --> 23:28.893
Honey, this is crazy.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.194
How do you not sleep?

23:30.262 --> 23:31.962
You-you have to sleep.

23:32.030 --> 23:35.099
It's 6:15. The girls
are gonna be up in a minute.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.635
I was hoping
we'd get home before...

23:37.703 --> 23:39.370
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

23:39.438 --> 23:41.038
I'm going to stay
awake tonight, okay?

23:41.106 --> 23:42.306
I'll watch you sleep.

23:42.374 --> 23:44.175
If it looks like you're
having a nightmare,

23:44.242 --> 23:45.509
Then I'll wake you up.

23:45.577 --> 23:47.812
And if you make it till
midnight, then we'll switch.

23:47.879 --> 23:50.448
I'll sleep for a few hours,
and-and you stay awake.

23:50.515 --> 23:52.183
And we'll keep doing
that until morning.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.118
And that way, between
the two of us,

23:54.186 --> 23:55.619
We'll share a good
night's sleep.

23:55.687 --> 23:58.355
How's that sound?

24:00.892 --> 24:02.893
(phone ringing)

24:04.329 --> 24:05.796
Mrs. Dubois?

24:05.864 --> 24:07.665
Oh, hi.

24:07.733 --> 24:09.934
Mrs. Catalano, I didn't know
you were coming by.

24:10.001 --> 24:12.336
I didn't know
I was coming by.

24:12.404 --> 24:14.371
The district attorney
called me late last night,

24:14.439 --> 24:16.707
Invited me to be part
of a press conference

24:16.775 --> 24:18.008
That they're having
this morning.

24:18.076 --> 24:22.079
Anyway, I saw you sitting
over here, and I wanted

24:22.147 --> 24:24.248
To come over and
say thank you.

24:24.316 --> 24:26.650
They told me that
you were the one

24:26.718 --> 24:28.319
Who figured out
who killed daddy.

24:28.386 --> 24:30.354
Well, not-not me by myself,

24:30.422 --> 24:33.090
But you're very welcome.

24:33.158 --> 24:36.794
Well, I am sure that you
hear this all the time,

24:36.862 --> 24:39.964
But if there's anything
that I can do for you...

24:40.031 --> 24:41.398
Oh, thank you.

24:41.466 --> 24:44.668
Um, I'm just glad
they caught the guy.

24:44.736 --> 24:46.937
Mm.

24:47.005 --> 24:49.106
Ooh, my.

24:49.174 --> 24:51.308
I'd better get going.

24:51.376 --> 24:53.177
Thank you.

24:56.882 --> 24:58.682
Oh, my,
what happened to your hand?

24:58.750 --> 25:00.718
Ow.

25:00.786 --> 25:03.554
It...It's really not that bad.

25:03.622 --> 25:06.891
Um, actually,
I did it to myself.

25:06.958 --> 25:08.092
Really?

25:08.160 --> 25:09.460
When I got the call

25:09.528 --> 25:11.262
About dad, and they told me

25:11.329 --> 25:13.497
That he was really
dead, I must have

25:13.565 --> 25:16.200
Just grabbed my hand and
started squeezing it.

25:16.268 --> 25:19.170
Anything. Anything to keep
from screaming out loud,

25:19.237 --> 25:22.006
And I guess that...

25:22.073 --> 25:24.408
I didn't even realize
that I was doing that.

25:24.476 --> 25:26.410
But, um...

25:26.478 --> 25:28.879
Anyway, uh, I'd
better get going.

25:28.947 --> 25:30.948
Again, thank you.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.755
(school bell ringing)

25:37.823 --> 25:39.890
I'm really sorry, miss colletto.

25:39.958 --> 25:42.860
I shouldn't have given
miss scarlet a piece of candy,

25:42.928 --> 25:46.096
And I should have told you
what I did.

25:46.164 --> 25:49.667
Thanks for coming in
and telling me that, bridgette.

25:49.734 --> 25:52.736
That must have been
a hard thing to do.

25:54.239 --> 25:56.240
Can you keep a secret?

25:57.876 --> 26:01.011
See mr. Nibbles back there?

26:01.079 --> 26:03.013
No one else knows this,

26:03.081 --> 26:05.249
But he's really mr. Nibbles two.

26:05.317 --> 26:08.519
See, I took the first
mr. Nibbles home with me

26:08.587 --> 26:10.521
One weekend,
and I forgot to shut the door

26:10.589 --> 26:12.189
To the room
where I was keeping him.

26:12.257 --> 26:14.358
Turns out, my cat was able
to knock the top off his cage.

26:14.426 --> 26:17.862
Long story short,
I spent most of my Sunday

26:17.929 --> 26:19.663
Driving from pet store
to pet store

26:19.731 --> 26:21.298
Looking for a mr. Nibbles
look-alike.

26:21.366 --> 26:24.101
(coughs)

26:24.169 --> 26:25.769
These things happen, bridgette.

26:25.837 --> 26:28.005
You probably shouldn't
have given miss scarlet

26:28.073 --> 26:30.507
A piece of candy,
but you can't even be sure

26:30.575 --> 26:32.009
That that's what made her die.

26:32.077 --> 26:35.112
(coughing)

26:35.180 --> 26:37.715
(coughing loudly)

26:37.782 --> 26:39.416
(wheezes, then coughs)

26:39.484 --> 26:40.784
(quiet choking)

26:50.662 --> 26:53.230
Bridgette, what is it?

26:53.298 --> 26:55.032
Are you okay?

26:55.100 --> 26:57.968
(gasps)

26:58.036 --> 27:00.971
Joe (whispering):
She's got her sweatshirt
like that

27:01.039 --> 27:03.374
So the tarantula can't
get into her mouth.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.679
(sighs)

27:08.747 --> 27:09.880
You still sore?

27:09.948 --> 27:11.115
Yeah. No.

27:11.182 --> 27:12.516
You know what's weird?

27:12.584 --> 27:14.952
Why don't we talk about
what isn't weird, huh?

27:15.020 --> 27:17.121
That would be a much shorter
conversation.

27:17.188 --> 27:19.757
You know that man-- the one
who owned the funeral home,

27:19.824 --> 27:20.925
The man who was killed?

27:20.992 --> 27:22.326
His daughter came
into work today,

27:22.394 --> 27:24.461
And she had the exact same cuts
I have.

27:24.529 --> 27:26.597
What do you mean?

27:26.665 --> 27:29.566
I mean, exactly the same--
the same place, same everything.

27:29.634 --> 27:32.836
Maybe she ran into the
same zombie you did.

27:32.904 --> 27:34.171
They were exactly the same.

27:34.239 --> 27:36.006
That can't be
a coincidence, can it?

27:36.074 --> 27:37.241
I don't know, al.

27:37.309 --> 27:38.909
And I'm happy to
keep talking about it

27:38.977 --> 27:40.978
For as long as you
like, but keep in mind,

27:41.046 --> 27:42.446
You're cutting into
your first sleep shift.

27:42.514 --> 27:46.317
Remember, you got to be up
to relieve me in three hours.

27:46.384 --> 27:51.021
Hey, if I even snore weird,
you're gonna wake me up, right?

27:51.089 --> 27:52.489
You go to sleep.

27:52.557 --> 27:53.691
I got it covered.

27:53.758 --> 27:56.126
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

28:04.703 --> 28:06.370
No! No! No!

28:06.438 --> 28:08.372
(screaming)

28:08.440 --> 28:09.807
No!

28:09.874 --> 28:11.308
(screams)

28:20.585 --> 28:22.386
(panting)

28:22.454 --> 28:24.455
(grunting)

28:28.360 --> 28:29.994
(sighs)

28:30.061 --> 28:34.965
Joe, if you can hear me,
I'd really like to wake up now.

28:35.033 --> 28:37.034
(debris clinking, thudding)

28:38.636 --> 28:40.337
(glass breaking)

28:40.405 --> 28:42.106
(screaming)

28:45.210 --> 28:46.677
Joe!

28:48.046 --> 28:49.880
(indistinct shouting)

28:49.948 --> 28:51.882
(allison screaming,
joe grunting)

28:56.087 --> 28:57.721
(joe grunting)

28:59.257 --> 29:00.557
(panting)

29:00.625 --> 29:02.059
(frantic knocking)

29:02.127 --> 29:04.128
(indistinct shouting
outside door)

29:05.630 --> 29:06.930
(woman screaming)

29:06.998 --> 29:08.098
Ariel:
Let us in!

29:08.166 --> 29:09.333
Please! Dad's hurt.

29:09.401 --> 29:10.834
You have to let us in.

29:10.902 --> 29:12.069
Yeah.
Can you hear me?

29:12.137 --> 29:14.104
You have to help us!
You promised!

29:14.172 --> 29:15.639
No, I can't!

29:15.707 --> 29:17.107
Joe:
Please. I'm out of bullets.

29:17.175 --> 29:19.009
For the love of god,
let us in!

29:19.077 --> 29:20.210
No!

29:20.278 --> 29:21.712
No. I have to protect myself.

29:21.780 --> 29:22.880
(woman screaming)

29:22.947 --> 29:25.783
If I let you in,
you might kill me.

29:25.850 --> 29:28.452
I can't let myself die
in a dream!

29:28.520 --> 29:30.387
Ariel:
Let us in, please?

29:30.455 --> 29:32.689
No, I can't.

29:32.757 --> 29:33.891
(woman screaming)

29:33.958 --> 29:35.225
I'm sorry.

29:35.293 --> 29:36.927
Oh, no, I don't want to die.

29:36.995 --> 29:38.162
I don't want to die.

29:38.229 --> 29:39.730
I don't want
to die!

29:39.798 --> 29:41.632
I don't want to die.
I don't to die.

29:41.699 --> 29:42.900
I don't want to die.
Allison.

29:42.967 --> 29:44.268
I don't want to... Die!
Easy.

29:44.335 --> 29:46.003
It's okay. You're awake.

29:46.071 --> 29:48.839
You're safe.
(crying)

29:51.088 --> 29:53.456
Hey, al, it was just a
dream, that's all it was.

29:53.524 --> 29:55.759
Okay? Nothing scratched
you, nothing bit you.

29:55.826 --> 29:57.260
You're fine.

29:57.328 --> 29:59.329
I know, you're right.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.300
It's your turn.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.603
<i>Man (on tv):
This one is nice and fresh,</i>

30:06.671 --> 30:08.471
But if this was all brown,
you just simply want to...

30:08.539 --> 30:11.508
Male announcer:
And that's his first two.
Devon gray, and there's...

30:11.576 --> 30:13.944
Man #2 (on tv):
...Harriet banks
are the lucky winners

30:14.011 --> 30:15.645
Of this past weekend's
super lottery draw.

30:15.713 --> 30:18.982
The pair came forward to claim
their $11 million prize...

30:19.050 --> 30:21.918
(suspenseful horror movie
music plays)

30:40.204 --> 30:42.272
Hello?

30:44.342 --> 30:46.509
Hello?

31:14.939 --> 31:16.940
(three gunshots)

31:18.809 --> 31:21.211
(rapid gunshots)

31:23.514 --> 31:25.015
(sporadic gunshots)

31:37.962 --> 31:39.896
(distant rapid gunfire)

31:39.964 --> 31:41.965
(panting)

31:51.208 --> 31:53.310
(distant rapid gunfire)

32:01.852 --> 32:03.086
(gunshot)

32:03.154 --> 32:05.088
(panting)

32:05.156 --> 32:06.956
Man:
Careful. That's hot.

32:07.024 --> 32:08.325
(steam hisses)
(shrieks)

32:08.392 --> 32:10.627
You already know that,
don't you?

32:10.695 --> 32:12.962
Why are you pointing that thing
at me?

32:13.030 --> 32:14.397
I'm not one of them.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.399
We know exactly who
you are, barbara.

32:16.467 --> 32:17.567
My name is not barbara.

32:17.635 --> 32:18.768
It's allison.

32:18.836 --> 32:20.337
Scanlon:
Don't bother lying.

32:20.404 --> 32:23.306
We already found your
lab over that hill.

32:23.374 --> 32:24.607
We know all about the concoction

32:24.675 --> 32:26.176
You cooked up
in your tanks, barbara.

32:26.243 --> 32:28.044
What are you talking about?

32:28.112 --> 32:29.679
Scanlon:
We know that everything
that happened here

32:29.747 --> 32:31.981
Last night was
your fault.

32:32.049 --> 32:34.250
I've never seen
these things before.

32:34.318 --> 32:35.518
(exhales)
look.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.320
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:37.388 --> 32:39.155
What lab, what concoction?

32:39.223 --> 32:41.191
You made all those
people sick, barbara.

32:41.258 --> 32:42.192
You poisoned them.

32:42.259 --> 32:44.527
No, you're wrong.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.529
You know what?

32:46.597 --> 32:48.531
I'm glad I was the
one who found you.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.500
No, where am I going?!

32:50.568 --> 32:52.869
The pentagon wants us to keep
a few of the specimens alive.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.170
Given their
ravenous appetites,

32:54.238 --> 32:55.638
I was worried the
creatures wouldn't make it

32:55.706 --> 32:57.607
All the way
to washington.
(yells)

32:57.675 --> 32:59.642
I guess it's good we
found them a snack.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.177
No!

33:01.245 --> 33:02.178
Get that door.

33:02.246 --> 33:03.380
No.

33:03.447 --> 33:04.714
No, please!

33:04.782 --> 33:07.917
(groaning)

33:20.731 --> 33:22.832
(banging on door)
let me out!

33:22.900 --> 33:25.034
Please.

33:25.102 --> 33:27.771
(screaming)

33:30.474 --> 33:31.908
Let me out!

33:31.976 --> 33:36.179
(screaming)

33:36.247 --> 33:38.047
(gasps)

33:38.115 --> 33:39.249
Oh.

33:40.016 --> 33:43.185
Joe:
Hey, you never woke me.

33:43.253 --> 33:45.087
(sighs)
I fell asleep.

33:45.155 --> 33:47.189
And?

33:47.257 --> 33:48.991
It was horrible.

33:49.059 --> 33:51.127
I guess I survived it,
though.

33:51.194 --> 33:52.995
Scanlon and devalos
were there.

33:53.063 --> 33:54.163
Really?

33:54.231 --> 33:57.333
Any sign of the tin
man or the scarecrow?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.434
They kept calling me
barbara,

33:58.502 --> 34:00.302
And they said I was
responsible for all of it

34:00.370 --> 34:02.738
And then they threw me
in the back of this truck,

34:02.806 --> 34:06.742
And you were there
and the girls.

34:06.810 --> 34:10.146
Wait a second, I thought you
said that we were all dead.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.483
Oh.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.489
You all ate me,
all of you feasted on me.

34:23.493 --> 34:27.429
Well, y-you don't look
any worse for wear.

34:27.496 --> 34:31.600
Seriously, um, wasn't this
exactly the kind of dream

34:31.668 --> 34:33.502
That we were worried about?

34:33.570 --> 34:35.170
I mean, if we did
actually, you know,

34:35.237 --> 34:37.139
Eat you in this dream,

34:37.206 --> 34:39.507
It's pretty safe to
assume that you were dead

34:39.576 --> 34:40.809
If not when the
meal started,

34:40.877 --> 34:42.311
Certainly by the
time it ended.

34:42.379 --> 34:46.415
You're not dreaming now and
you look pretty lively to me.

34:46.483 --> 34:48.417
I guess you're right.
Yeah.

34:48.485 --> 34:51.853
Man (over tv):
It's usually a series of four
treatment sessions to reduce...

34:51.922 --> 34:53.355
What is that?

34:53.422 --> 34:57.159
I guess I did sustain
an injury in that dream.

34:57.227 --> 34:59.395
When I touched something hot,
it burned me.

34:59.462 --> 35:01.597
Oh, god.

35:01.665 --> 35:06.135
I guess if you dreamt
about being eaten alive

35:06.203 --> 35:08.837
By the reanimated corpses
of your dead family,

35:08.905 --> 35:10.706
And that's the only
wound you got, I guess

35:10.774 --> 35:13.175
You could consider
yourself lucky.

35:13.243 --> 35:15.177
(knocking)

35:15.245 --> 35:16.679
Allison:
I'm sorry.

35:16.746 --> 35:19.748
No one was in front, so I just
made my way around the back.

35:19.816 --> 35:22.284
Oh, it's okay,
mrs. Dubois.

35:22.352 --> 35:24.053
What can I do for you?

35:24.120 --> 35:27.623
I brought by your father's
personal effects.

35:27.691 --> 35:30.326
Uh, I read in
the paper that

35:30.393 --> 35:32.127
The viewing was tomorrow,
and I wanted to make sure

35:32.195 --> 35:34.863
That you had everything
you needed-- his watch,

35:34.931 --> 35:36.832
His wedding band.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.335
Well, you're very thoughtful.

35:39.402 --> 35:41.337
Actually,
our embalmer steven's

35:41.404 --> 35:44.006
On his way over
with daddy's remains.

35:44.074 --> 35:48.077
I was just getting...
The room ready.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.847
You all right?

35:51.915 --> 35:56.652
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just...

35:56.720 --> 35:58.854
Daddy always used to say,

35:58.922 --> 36:01.724
"death never takes
the wise man by surprise;

36:01.791 --> 36:05.894
He is always ready to go
or to let go."

36:05.962 --> 36:09.164
I guess I'm not feeling
terribly wise right now.

36:13.603 --> 36:17.072
Uh... Shoot.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.507
Do you happen
to have a pen?

36:18.575 --> 36:21.343
If you wouldn't mind
signing this receipt

36:21.411 --> 36:23.879
That you received your
father's personal effects...

36:24.914 --> 36:27.049
(bell dings, steam hisses)

36:27.117 --> 36:30.119
Could you just give me one
moment to empty the autoclave?

36:30.186 --> 36:31.553
I was just cleaning
some instruments

36:31.621 --> 36:34.356
For steven.

36:46.970 --> 36:49.138
Excuse me, what are those?

36:50.173 --> 36:52.975
Those?

36:53.043 --> 36:54.176
They're the embalming tanks.

36:54.244 --> 36:55.611
They hold the fluid
the embalmer uses

36:55.679 --> 36:59.048
To replace the blood
in the dead body.

36:59.115 --> 37:01.116
Ethanol,
methanol,

37:01.184 --> 37:04.086
Formaldehyde.

37:04.154 --> 37:05.487
(sizzling)
oh!

37:08.458 --> 37:10.392
Sorry.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.494
Burned myself.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.404
Bobbi?

37:22.472 --> 37:23.672
Huh?

37:23.740 --> 37:24.673
That wouldn't happen to be short

37:24.741 --> 37:26.342
For barbara, would it?

37:26.409 --> 37:28.477
As a matter of fact, it is.

37:28.545 --> 37:29.611
How did you know?

37:29.679 --> 37:30.646
(dry chuckle)

37:30.714 --> 37:31.880
(door opens)

37:43.226 --> 37:46.795
Okay, if you have something
to tell me,

37:46.863 --> 37:49.698
You're going to have
to figure out a way to tell me.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.507
Miss scarlet,

37:58.575 --> 38:00.776
I'm serious.

38:09.352 --> 38:12.788
Oh, eggs.

38:12.856 --> 38:14.957
Thank you again for
coming in, ms. Catalano.

38:15.024 --> 38:17.526
I realize how busy you must be
during this difficult time,

38:17.594 --> 38:19.728
So I'll get right
to the point.

38:19.796 --> 38:22.264
There have been some
recent developments

38:22.332 --> 38:24.933
In the investigation into
your father's murder.

38:25.001 --> 38:28.570
We now have reason to believe
that he bit his attacker

38:28.638 --> 38:29.738
Before he died.

38:29.806 --> 38:31.140
Really?

38:31.207 --> 38:32.808
All right.

38:32.876 --> 38:34.710
W-well, forgive me,
mr. Devalos,

38:34.778 --> 38:36.879
But I don't see
how that really qualifies

38:36.946 --> 38:38.480
As a new development.

38:38.548 --> 38:40.482
I-I don't want to hear
all the gory details

38:40.550 --> 38:42.484
About the fight between
my father and that man.

38:42.552 --> 38:43.485
Well, that's
the thing.

38:43.553 --> 38:45.487
That man edgar kripke--

38:45.555 --> 38:48.457
He doesn't have any bite
marks anywhere on his person,

38:48.525 --> 38:50.259
And as a result, we're
no longer convinced

38:50.326 --> 38:51.760
He's the one who
murdered your father.

38:51.828 --> 38:53.128
I don't understand.

38:53.196 --> 38:55.564
He had my father's watch,
he had my father's wallet.

38:55.632 --> 38:57.599
They had argued several times.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.602
Edgar kripke is an unmedicated
paranoid schizophrenic.

39:00.670 --> 39:02.738
He argued with many people
many times.

39:02.806 --> 39:04.139
He never hurt anyone.

39:04.207 --> 39:06.575
Now, as for
your father's possessions,

39:06.643 --> 39:09.278
If kripke was the first person
to find the body,

39:09.345 --> 39:11.113
Maybe he stole them

39:11.181 --> 39:12.748
Or maybe they were planted.

39:13.783 --> 39:16.985
Planted, really?

39:17.053 --> 39:19.555
Well, who would have wanted
to do that, I mean, and why?

39:19.622 --> 39:20.722
We're not entirely sure,

39:20.790 --> 39:22.925
But now that kripke's
guilt is in question

39:22.992 --> 39:24.960
And because there are
no other suspects,

39:25.028 --> 39:27.029
We are going to reopen
the investigation.

39:27.096 --> 39:28.730
Well, if that's
what you need to do...

39:28.798 --> 39:30.032
Typically,

39:30.099 --> 39:32.534
We begin with the last person
who saw the victim alive

39:32.602 --> 39:34.403
So we can rule them
out as a suspect.

39:34.471 --> 39:37.739
In this case that
person is you.

39:37.807 --> 39:40.108
So, if you
don't mind,

39:40.176 --> 39:41.109
We'd like you to
submit yourself

39:41.177 --> 39:42.811
To a brief physical
examination.

39:42.879 --> 39:46.148
If the female officer doesn't
find any bite marks on you,

39:46.216 --> 39:48.150
Then we can refocus
our energy elsewhere.

39:48.218 --> 39:49.718
You're joking.

39:49.786 --> 39:50.819
I beg your pardon?

39:50.887 --> 39:52.321
I loved my father.

39:52.388 --> 39:54.289
I would never hurt him.

39:54.357 --> 39:55.724
If he knew
how you were treating

39:55.792 --> 39:56.992
A member of his family,

39:57.060 --> 39:59.728
After everything that he has
done for this department...

39:59.796 --> 40:01.763
Are you aware that your business
has taken out

40:01.831 --> 40:03.365
No less
than five separate loans

40:03.433 --> 40:05.167
From the bank
over the past few years?

40:05.235 --> 40:07.870
Do you read the
papers, mr. Detective?

40:07.937 --> 40:10.172
The economy is not
what it used to be.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.174
And yes, people
are still dying,

40:12.242 --> 40:14.510
But their survivors are
not spending the money.

40:14.577 --> 40:15.611
Now, what is your point?

40:15.678 --> 40:17.880
I also called a few
of your suppliers.

40:17.947 --> 40:19.348
If business is down,

40:19.415 --> 40:21.717
Maybe you could explain to me
why, over the past year or so,

40:21.784 --> 40:23.986
You ordered three times
more embalming fluid

40:24.053 --> 40:25.454
Than in previous years.

40:25.522 --> 40:28.290
Are you aware that
embalming fluid is a mixture

40:28.358 --> 40:31.493
Of ethanol, methanol,
and formaldehyde--

40:31.561 --> 40:33.462
The ingredients
in the drug wet?

40:33.530 --> 40:34.763
I did not know that.

40:34.831 --> 40:36.131
We've been curious how
our local drug dealers

40:36.199 --> 40:39.902
Have been able to put
so much out on the street.

40:39.969 --> 40:41.703
You care to venture
any theories?

40:41.771 --> 40:44.006
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

40:44.073 --> 40:46.742
Your father figured out
what you were doing.

40:46.809 --> 40:49.311
He confronted you.

40:49.379 --> 40:50.546
There was a struggle.

40:50.613 --> 40:52.047
He bit you

40:52.115 --> 40:54.983
On your right calf.

40:55.051 --> 40:57.286
Devalos:
I, for one, appreciate
everything your father did

40:57.353 --> 40:59.821
To help the men and women
that serve this city.

40:59.889 --> 41:02.591
That's why, provided
you enter a guilty plea

41:02.659 --> 41:04.293
And make a full confession,

41:04.360 --> 41:05.627
I'm prepared to
discuss a deal

41:05.695 --> 41:07.696
With whoever you hire
to represent you,

41:07.764 --> 41:09.531
Or if you insist on
doing it the hard way,

41:09.599 --> 41:12.568
I'll simply have detective
scanlon here arrest you,

41:12.635 --> 41:15.003
And once your calf has been
examined for a bite mark,

41:15.071 --> 41:18.140
Well, then... Then
your fate will lie

41:18.207 --> 41:20.642
In the hands
of the jury.

41:25.281 --> 41:30.052
He asked me to meet him
at my mother's grave.

41:32.221 --> 41:34.790
And he told me that
he knew everything.

41:37.594 --> 41:39.728
(quavering):
He said my mama

41:39.796 --> 41:43.165
Would have been
ashamed of me.

41:46.169 --> 41:48.670
<i>Marie:
Those are all eggs?</i>

41:48.738 --> 41:50.105
Yep.

41:50.173 --> 41:51.740
Did you know that
a tarantula can lay

41:51.808 --> 41:53.542
Up to 2,000
eggs at a time?

41:53.610 --> 41:54.543
They're not going

41:54.611 --> 41:56.478
To hatch here,
are they?

41:56.546 --> 41:58.580
No, probably not.

41:58.648 --> 42:00.749
I called miss colletto
as soon as I found them,

42:00.817 --> 42:01.984
And she says
that she's going

42:02.051 --> 42:03.619
To take 'em
to the pet store tomorrow

42:03.686 --> 42:05.687
And make sure
they all get good homes.

42:05.755 --> 42:07.222
It's what miss scarlet
would have wanted.

42:07.290 --> 42:09.057
(allison cackles)

42:09.125 --> 42:12.861
You two ready
for a little trick-or-treating?

42:12.929 --> 42:15.964
Okay, you're a witch,
I get that, but dad,

42:16.032 --> 42:17.466
What are you
supposed to be?

42:17.533 --> 42:18.934
I'm a nerd.

42:19.002 --> 42:21.003
Ariel, honey,
we're going to see you later.

42:21.070 --> 42:22.404
We're taking off.

42:22.472 --> 42:23.639
