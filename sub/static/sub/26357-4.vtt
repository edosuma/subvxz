00:02.070 --> 00:04.072
*

00:11.445 --> 00:14.082
(sobbing)

00:15.449 --> 00:16.450
(small sob)

00:18.186 --> 00:19.187
(bigger sob, sniffles)

00:21.455 --> 00:23.057
(sobbing loudly)

00:25.293 --> 00:28.396
There's something very,
very weird about this place.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.998
Even the seagulls
have a New England accent.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.367
(squawking)

00:33.401 --> 00:34.735
A-yup.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.604
Why did we vacation here?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.207
It was on a list
of top ten places to see

00:39.240 --> 00:41.342
before you mysteriously
disappear.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.610
Fool.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.079
This whole contest was a ruse.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.514
What the...?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.216
You are here to be sacrificed

00:48.249 --> 00:51.519
to an evil god
from the ocean depths.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.421
-SpongeBob?
-No!

00:53.454 --> 00:56.457
The eternal lord of horror,
Cthulhu.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.492
("Night on Bald Mountain"
playing)

01:08.902 --> 01:10.904
HOMER:
What the...?!

01:14.942 --> 01:16.076
(growls)

01:20.848 --> 01:23.284
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait just a minute!

01:23.317 --> 01:25.953
I was promised
an eating contest,

01:25.986 --> 01:27.955
and by the ancient law
of the flyer,

01:27.988 --> 01:29.923
you have to provide me with one.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.959
Very well.

01:33.494 --> 01:37.465
An eating contest
against the monstrous Cthulhu?

01:37.498 --> 01:41.969
To him, the Great Barrier Reef
is just an average barrier reef.

01:42.002 --> 01:45.606
-Well, my dad
didn't eat breakfast.
-Uh-oh.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.576
Mm. Mm. Mm.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.578
How you doing, Cthu?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.346
(retches)
Shut up, okay?

01:52.380 --> 01:53.581
Just shut up.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.250
(belches) I need
to take a walk, that's all.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.320
I-I'll be fine.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.490
I win. And I get
to name the prize.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.824
(gasps)
Fine.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.928
I'll give you whatever you want.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.365
Immortal life? Whale watching
where you actually see a whale?

02:11.399 --> 02:14.602
Hmm. I know exactly what I want.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.337
(whispers indistinctly)

02:16.370 --> 02:17.538
Oh, man.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.174
BART:
Mm, mm, mm.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.611
Ooh, ink sac.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.646
*

02:36.324 --> 02:38.326
*

02:40.428 --> 02:42.430
(James Bond theme playing)

02:46.267 --> 02:49.403
Now for a word from our late,
beloved Mapple founder,

02:49.437 --> 02:52.740
-Steve Mobs.
-(cheering, applause)

02:52.773 --> 02:54.041
Hello.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.743
(cheering wildly)

02:55.776 --> 02:57.545
And stop.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.580
Since my unfortunate passing,

02:59.613 --> 03:01.249
if things have gone
as I've planned,

03:01.282 --> 03:03.684
Mapple is now
a trillion-dollar company,

03:03.717 --> 03:07.187
Roseanne has come and gone
like a summer storm

03:07.221 --> 03:10.658
and a less exciting version
of me has taken my place.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.526
I'm wearing your pants, Steve.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.263
And now I'm here to introduce
the new Myphone Ultima,

03:15.296 --> 03:17.097
which comes
in the colors black...

03:17.130 --> 03:18.532
(cheering)

03:18.566 --> 03:21.335
-...slate gray...
-(cheering)

03:21.369 --> 03:24.104
-...and that's it.
-(cheering)

03:28.942 --> 03:32.346
The time has come.
Commence operations.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.414
Can't they see you?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.750
They see nothing.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.522
This is too easy.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.458
For you. You just look
at the monitor.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.375
Uh, Lenny? My phone says
that there's spores

04:01.409 --> 04:04.077
from outer space
landing all around us.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.079
Well, my phone says there are
divorced moms in my area

04:06.113 --> 04:07.615
that want to meet me.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.550
*

04:09.583 --> 04:10.818
(shrieks)

04:17.958 --> 04:20.227
Oh, great, an homage
to Body Snatchers,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.596
which in itself was a rip-off
of The Thing.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.633
This will be the last word
I ever say: C minus!

04:26.800 --> 04:28.168
(groans softly)

04:28.201 --> 04:30.738
I want to return
this comic book.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.741
The dialogue sounded forced
when I read it aloud.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.578
I will help you, but first,
you are in danger.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.614
You can crash at my pod,
I mean pad.

04:40.648 --> 04:44.718
No one says "pad" anymore. Run!

04:48.389 --> 04:50.157
Dad, I'm worried.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.825
Everyone's turning
into a zombie.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.361
(gurgling)

04:53.394 --> 04:55.763
Thank God you're okay.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
Mom! Something's wrong.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.834
There is no escape.
We are all-powerful.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.905
Boy, Maggie, you're carrying
a lot of anger towards Mom.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.311
Chief, Chief, space plants
are eating everyone.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.113
You're telling me.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.615
-(both gasp)
-Eh, don't feel bad.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.216
He was a lousy chief.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.619
You know, my feelings
haven't dissolved yet, Lou.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.888
Now, kids,
that's just air escaping.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.322
(gunshot)

05:22.356 --> 05:23.857
You cannot stop us.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.059
It is really just a matter of...

05:26.093 --> 05:28.796
How comes aliens
never use contractions?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.064
We think it is scary.

05:31.098 --> 05:36.269
It is why we call Jerry's Deli
the Deli of Jerry.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.440
Oh! Conifer down.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.211
(laughs)

05:44.244 --> 05:45.646
(tires screeching)

05:45.679 --> 05:47.247
I'm not a plant!

05:47.280 --> 05:50.918
Prove it. Name the roster
of the Glasgow soccer club.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.887
I don't-I don't know.
I-Is there a-a Rooney?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.590
There's always a Rooney. Ah!

05:56.624 --> 05:58.626
(tires screech)

06:00.461 --> 06:02.530
(Bart and Lisa scream)

06:02.563 --> 06:06.166
Bart, dystopian movies have
taught me two things:

06:06.199 --> 06:10.337
"A," you can make a four-part
movie from a three-part book,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.573
and "B," there is no hope.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.375
So I'm saying good-bye
to you now, Bart.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.677
Good-bye, sister.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.713
The last sound you hear
will be... (motorboating lips)

06:23.917 --> 06:26.887
(Ligeti's Requiem playing)

06:38.331 --> 06:40.133
* You don't win friends
with salad *

06:40.167 --> 06:42.536
* You don't win
friends with salad... *

06:42.570 --> 06:45.105
(Requiem continues)

06:52.279 --> 06:55.649
Congratulations,
fortunate Earth-being.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.385
Welcome to your new paradise.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.488
(man laughing)

07:00.521 --> 07:02.490
-Where are we?
-We're on a planet

07:02.523 --> 07:05.759
in what you incorrectly call
the Crab Nebula.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.562
You live
in the Crab Nebula. You.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.298
Why would you kill me
and then bring me here?

07:11.331 --> 07:13.601
We didn't kill you.
We have saved you.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.236
When you were absorbed on Earth,
your consciousness

07:16.269 --> 07:20.340
was transferred here
to this utopia, ha, ha.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.009
Well, my daughter will be
very happy

07:22.042 --> 07:23.811
living with you green beans.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.513
She's a vegetarian.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.614
Murderer.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.115
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.417
Have a piece of my ass.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.485
Uh...

07:31.519 --> 07:32.753
So wait, wait, wait.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.622
We're all pod people?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.757
I'm afraid you were
already pod people.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.626
What are you talking about?

07:38.659 --> 07:42.129
iPod people, phone checkers,
tablet gazers.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.432
Never lifting your petals
to see the sun.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.535
Yes. Yes. This is perfect.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.470
A sci-fi story
with a happy ending.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.839
Now let us brag some more.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.942
We are many, but we move as one.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.611
ALIEN 2: Finding out the best
of each other.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.881
ALIEN: Giving the love
that lets us go on.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.482
Where'd you get those?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.284
We just found them
wrapped under that guy.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.986
It's what I do, man.
How you doing?

08:06.019 --> 08:07.220
Herb Tannenbaum.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.460
-(Bart groans)
-(grunting)

08:13.493 --> 08:15.462
-He's waking up.
-Yes.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.198
Is there anything
punching can't do?

08:18.231 --> 08:21.635
It can't set a clock.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.470
(grunts)
What's going on?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.639
Where are we?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.507
(loud footsteps approaching)

08:29.276 --> 08:30.578
Who did this to us?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.512
Uh, the last thing I remember

08:32.546 --> 08:35.048
is crashing a sleepover
at Milhouse's.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.485
I got to work.
So spend the night here.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.220
But I'm not invited.

08:40.253 --> 08:44.224
You think I was invited
on the Toledo Mud Hens team bus?

08:44.257 --> 08:48.495
When I was asked to leave, my
left boob suddenly popped out.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.230
That was a game-changer.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.234
NELSON: Then somebody
mysteriously sent

08:54.267 --> 08:56.837
a case of orange drink,
which we drank.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.739
(groans)

08:58.772 --> 09:01.341
You guys passed out,
and my first thought

09:01.374 --> 09:03.376
was "Call the police."

09:03.410 --> 09:06.680
But even heroes fall.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.449
(footsteps approaching)

09:09.482 --> 09:10.550
(whimpering)

09:13.420 --> 09:14.622
Lisa?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.590
(English accent):
I'm not "Lisa."

09:16.624 --> 09:18.025
I'm Penelope.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.559
Whassup?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.528
Seriously, I want to know.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.196
I'm the one who brought you here

09:23.230 --> 09:26.533
after drugging
your SunnyD with Special K.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.301
As in ketamine.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.771
You K'd our D? You're crazy.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.307
Crazy, you say?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.076
(low voice):
Crazy.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.145
Crazy!

09:38.178 --> 09:41.481
(Milhouse's voice):
Who are you calling crazy?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.651
I'm not that loud.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.553
I'm gonna belt you.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.587
-Hmm.
-Eh.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.589
With a brassy Broadway tune.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.557
(shouting)

09:50.590 --> 09:52.125
*

09:52.159 --> 09:53.393
* You'll be trapped

09:53.426 --> 09:55.228
* Trapped like rats

09:55.262 --> 09:58.231
* No one knows
where you're ats *

09:58.265 --> 10:01.601
* You'll eat my shorts
then you'll have a cow *

10:01.635 --> 10:04.604
* I'm gonna kick you now.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.542
Applaud or die.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.648
-You die, boys.
-What? Why?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.784
Not one of you said "encore."

10:16.817 --> 10:20.320
But I think encores are
a ridiculous tradition.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.990
Just sing your songs and go.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.363
More pancakes, Lisa?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.032
(French accent):
Pancakes are meaningless.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.767
Life is meaningless.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.435
Marge, Lisa's being unusual.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.737
And where's Bart?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.974
Oh, yes, the Simpson boy.

10:41.008 --> 10:45.713
He called. He's staying with
the Milhouse for an extra day.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.848
And the great thing
about boys is

10:47.881 --> 10:50.718
that nothing bad
can ever happen to them.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.323
Come on, Milhouse,
put your brain into it.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.325
The door isn't even scratched.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.527
Oh, we were trying
to break the door?

11:00.560 --> 11:01.895
Okay, I got a plan.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.197
First, Milhouse,
gnaw through your ankle.

11:04.231 --> 11:08.969
I will,
but I'm allergic to myself.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.972
I swear, if you say
one more wimpy thing...

11:12.005 --> 11:14.407
Not my Gloria Vanderbilt
glasses.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.644
They were on the cover
of Women's Health.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.181
*

11:21.214 --> 11:22.415
Ha-ha!

11:22.449 --> 11:24.718
(sing-songy):
Lisa's wearing a dress.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.887
(Scottish accent):
All right, ya little beasties.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.824
Are ye ready for a trip
to the Scottish Die-lands?

11:30.858 --> 11:33.226
Just let yourselves out,

11:33.260 --> 11:35.896
but beware the Beast!

11:35.929 --> 11:37.831
Ah, isn't that cute?
She learned an accent

11:37.865 --> 11:39.532
from Groundskeeper Willie.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.434
Not that cute.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.602
BART:
Ay caramba!

11:42.635 --> 11:46.273
*

11:49.442 --> 11:52.545
Wish I could burn
the calories off that easily.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.182
(singsongy):
You've got body issues.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.051
*

12:02.489 --> 12:06.526
(deep voice): It's time
to recycle, you stupid boys.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.295
Careful, Lisa.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.463
If you keep yelling like that,
you'll get vocal polyps

12:10.497 --> 12:12.132
like Adele.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.603
(grunts)

12:16.636 --> 12:20.307
Please wear one of my bones
around your neck...

12:21.508 --> 12:23.410
(grunts)

12:23.443 --> 12:27.280
Ha-ha! You missed.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.488
What happened to you?

12:35.522 --> 12:38.491
You know what you did!

12:49.837 --> 12:51.304
(laughter)

12:53.941 --> 12:57.110
Well, well, Little Miss Perfect.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.512
I'm sure somebody changed this,
but I don't care.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.618
You know, I never feel more like
a trademark corporate spokesman

13:05.652 --> 13:08.188
than when I wake up
in an empty bed.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.623
You can never make me feel
as good as this.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.659
Oh, no!

13:13.726 --> 13:17.965
You ruined Lisa's life
and on that day,

13:17.998 --> 13:21.334
the Beast was born!

13:21.368 --> 13:23.570
(yells)

13:27.975 --> 13:32.679
One American creates
this much garbage in one day.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.515
Oh, just kill me.
Don't teach me.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.984
(crying):
I'm your brother.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.186
(Bart cries)

13:39.219 --> 13:42.389
(normal voice): If you have
a great speech to save yourself,

13:42.422 --> 13:43.991
now would be the time.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.625
I'm rooting for ya.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.527
Lis, please forgive me.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.997
I'm your big brother.
I'll always be there for you.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.531
When your boyfriend dumps you,

13:51.564 --> 13:54.134
I'll take you drinking
and tell you what a jerk he was.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.503
When he takes you back,
I'll tell you he's great

13:56.536 --> 13:57.905
and go to games with him.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.706
I'll humanize
your campaign biography.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.908
Am I reaching you?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.243
(gasps) It worked.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.511
I'm back.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.845
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.580
Why'd you do it, sweetie?

14:07.614 --> 14:12.485
Sometimes, Mom, a woman gets
pushed so far, she just snaps.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.488
You know how that feels,
don't you? Don't you?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.490
No, not at all.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.758
Where's Dad?

14:18.791 --> 14:20.493
Tied up in the trunk of the car.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.930
How am I supposed to know
the day we got married

14:22.963 --> 14:25.032
falls on our wedding
anniversary?

14:25.065 --> 14:28.035
Always wanted to be a paper boy.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.403
You know, you're cute this way.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.540
Aw. Have a perfume sample.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.713
*

14:42.549 --> 14:44.217
So, Smithers, what do you think?

14:44.251 --> 14:48.021
I'll rejuvenate the elderly
using untested dinosaur DNA.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.624
It could make me a fortune or
fill the world with monsters.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.294
It could make me a fortune.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.329
(uplifting music playing)

15:15.615 --> 15:17.484
Why do you need doors?

15:17.517 --> 15:20.487
You could just
fly over the wall.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.823
-Damn it.
-I hope Grandpa's happy

15:23.856 --> 15:26.326
in this new retirement home.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.728
"I'm sure he's happier here"

15:28.761 --> 15:31.064
is what we'll always say
about old people

15:31.098 --> 15:32.665
no matter where we put them.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.642
There's something weird
about this place...

15:42.675 --> 15:44.944
that doesn't show up on any map.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.480
Oh, Lisa, you're always
so suspicious.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.682
Welcome to Geriatric Park

15:49.716 --> 15:53.120
where our motto is,
"No further questions."

15:53.153 --> 15:56.323
ANNOUNCER: Here at
Geriatric Park, we combine

15:56.356 --> 16:00.460
speculative theories
with untested technologies

16:00.493 --> 16:04.431
to give our seniors
a better life.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.799
Possible side effects include:
back spikes, protective plates,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.535
giant claws, fear of asteroids,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.503
being a precursor
to our modern birds,

16:10.537 --> 16:12.872
a second tail brain, loss
of ears and increased libido.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.042
If you are currently egg-laying
or expect to be egg-laying,

16:15.075 --> 16:17.177
consult your paleontologist.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.413
Now, meet your Jurassic
perked-up loved ones.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.617
(music resembling "Theme
from Jurassic Park" plays)

16:24.651 --> 16:26.553
* They were old

16:26.586 --> 16:29.622
* They were sad

16:29.656 --> 16:34.627
* And their joints all hurt

16:34.661 --> 16:37.497
* Now they're here

16:37.530 --> 16:40.367
* And they're glad

16:40.400 --> 16:45.472
* They've hit pay dirt

16:45.505 --> 16:48.641
* Geriatric Park

16:48.675 --> 16:51.211
* Geriatric
Park *

16:51.244 --> 16:56.015
* It's so, so safe

16:56.049 --> 16:58.885
* Nothing can go wrong

16:58.918 --> 17:01.354
* Can go wrong, can go wrong

17:01.388 --> 17:03.723
* Can go wrong--

17:03.756 --> 17:08.395
Abe, I've never seen you
so vibrant and alive.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.363
Well, I don't like to complain.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.864
Wow, you have changed.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.601
But they keep it
a little cold here.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.670
Anything for you, Dad.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.073
Don't want to read.
I'm on vacation.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.476
*

17:33.753 --> 17:34.954
What's happening?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.556
Someone has raised
the temperature.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.358
Let's take a look
at the microscopic level

17:38.391 --> 17:39.859
with the peephole
and the twisty thing

17:39.892 --> 17:42.095
and the little slide of glass.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.405
(gurgles)

17:52.439 --> 17:54.441
Huh?

17:54.474 --> 17:55.875
Ah!

17:55.908 --> 17:58.245
Yah!

17:58.278 --> 18:01.047
(screeches)

18:01.080 --> 18:03.983
You even taste disappointing.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.585
Half of that taste is you.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.819
(growls)

18:08.788 --> 18:10.790
(theme resumes playing)

18:19.098 --> 18:21.601
Dang it.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.437
(grunts)

18:26.473 --> 18:28.475
(roars)

18:30.843 --> 18:33.646
(shouting)

18:40.553 --> 18:42.422
(grunts)

18:42.455 --> 18:43.923
You can't kill me.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.692
I'm your creator,
for flaving out loud.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.598
Credit hog.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.901
FRINK: You were listed
in the footnotes. Oy.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.539
Oh, we're saved.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.847
(roars)

19:07.880 --> 19:09.716
(gasps) It's my mom.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.618
In the best mood
we've ever seen her.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.553
(gasps) It's raining.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.021
The old people will head
to the TV room

19:15.054 --> 19:16.556
and watch The Weather Channel.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.626
That's not rain.
It's Grampa.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.661
(roars)

19:24.264 --> 19:26.032
Lisa, no!

19:26.065 --> 19:29.202
Sorry, I just believe in
the ultimate, basic goodness

19:29.236 --> 19:31.304
of people.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.573
Grampa, I don't think
you want to hurt me.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.409
You just want me
to see you as a person,

19:36.443 --> 19:41.013
not some strange, scary monster
we call a senior citizen.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.584
Grampa, I want
to hear your opinion

19:44.617 --> 19:46.986
about everything.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.389
She's making
the ultimate sacrifice:

19:49.422 --> 19:51.391
getting him started.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.429
Aw, Grampa.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.867
I still love you.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.404
All they wanted
was to be cherished.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.674
They've even learned how to get
respect from the orderlies.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.242
I don't care
if you haven't finished.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.678
I'm off the clock. (grunts)

20:11.711 --> 20:15.014
And once again, the true
monster, the soulless CEO,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.049
escapes unscathed.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.853
Oy. Too rich for my blood.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.689
Ugh. (coughs)

20:22.722 --> 20:24.624
That was a lovely visit.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.058
Although, I could've done

20:26.092 --> 20:28.060
without some
of the decapitations.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.264
Uh, Mom, where's the pilot?

20:31.298 --> 20:34.033
Virgin Air I'm not.
