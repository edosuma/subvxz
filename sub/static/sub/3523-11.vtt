Great.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.696
Listen...
that phone call...

03:50.196 --> 03:51.698
it was an old
girlfriend.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.700
Oh, you mean she wasn't

03:54.200 --> 03:55.702
My god, she sounde
d so convincing!

03:55.702 --> 03:57.704
I'm just trying
to be honest here.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.706
If you're trying to be
honest, why'd you lie?

04:00.206 --> 04:01.708
I didn't want
to piss you off.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.209
So, it's really
more about you, then.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.712
What are you talking
about? I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.714
No, what you said

04:07.714 --> 04:10.216
was that you didn'
t want to piss me off,

04:10.216 --> 04:12.218
which implies that
you'd have to deal with me,

04:12.218 --> 04:16.221
which is more abou
t sparing you than m
y fucking feelings!

04:26.733 --> 04:28.735
Merry christmas.

04:36.242 --> 04:38.745
Let's go with

04:51.257 --> 04:53.760
He owes sil

04:54.260 --> 04:55.762
For that oth
er thing, you know.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.764
I need you to go
pick it up tomorrow.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.265
Why don't sil go?

04:59.265 --> 05:01.267
I'm sending him home

05:01.267 --> 05:03.269
I didn't

05:03.269 --> 05:05.271
He's sick, he's

05:05.271 --> 05:07.774
I'm supposed to take my mother

05:08.274 --> 05:09.776
So, you do it after.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.277
The guy's in fairlawn.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.780
327 dexter avenue,
number six.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.282
I don't even
know why we deal
with these people.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.784
You wanna guess?

05:17.784 --> 05:18.785
They make us money.

05:18.785 --> 05:19.786
Thank you.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.289
And the family's well?

05:23.289 --> 05:26.292
Honestly, i'm
a little concerned
about our daughter.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.294
What's the problem?

05:28.294 --> 05:29.796
She's dating a boy...

05:29.796 --> 05:33.800
the son of some friend
s of the family actually.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.802
I think i mentioned
him to you.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.303
I don't know,

05:37.303 --> 05:40.306
i guess i'm not
as optimistic
as i once was.

05:40.306 --> 05:41.808
She was dating
a different boy,

05:42.308 --> 05:43.810
a young
african- american man?

05:44.310 --> 05:45.812
Yeah, they
broke up.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.313
Actually he br
oke it off with her.

05:47.313 --> 05:48.314
Believe that?

05:48.815 --> 05:50.817
You didn't exactly give
him much choice, tony.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.319
So now i'm responsible
for her being with jackie.

05:53.319 --> 05:56.322
I'm just saying
that if you hadn't
been so mean to him

05:56.322 --> 05:58.825
who knows, may
be she might not
be with this one.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.333
I find it
very interesting

06:07.333 --> 06:10.837
that you're able to ta
lk about this without rancor.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.843
Actually we haven't been
arguing as much lately.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.345
It's the therapy.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.348
We're learning
how to communicate.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.353
18 double word
score, that's 36.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.856
No spanish.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.358
Spanish?

06:32.358 --> 06:33.359
Oh- bleek- ay?

06:33.359 --> 06:34.861
Oblique.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.363
Indirect, not
straightforward.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.866
Come on, you're
in college.

06:39.866 --> 06:42.368
I'm not an
english major.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.386
As in, how'bout
giving me some?

07:00.386 --> 07:02.388
Jackie, i'm sick.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.891
I know, i'm
only kidding.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.396
Unless you
want to.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.398
Jackie.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.400
I'm kidding,
kidding.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.411
Wanna do

07:25.912 --> 07:27.413

Tired?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.421
Actually i am

07:35.922 --> 07:37.924
Mind if we finish

07:37.924 --> 07:38.925
Okay.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.930
Wow, you'r

07:43.930 --> 07:46.432
I'll come by tomorrow night
and bring you some echinacea.

07:47.433 --> 07:48.935
You're leaving?

07:49.936 --> 07:51.938
I better let you
get some sleep.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.948
The russians?
They're not all bad.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.950
How about the cuban
missile crisis?

08:03.950 --> 08:06.953
Cocksuckers moved
nuclear warheads
into cuba,

08:07.453 --> 08:08.955
pointed'em
right at us.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.456
That was real?

08:10.456 --> 08:12.959
I saw that movie,
i thought it
was bullshit.

08:15.962 --> 08:16.963
Who is?

08:16.963 --> 08:19.465
Kgb, openup.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.978

08:31.978 --> 08:34.480
Or the other 30 people
who live here?

08:35.982 --> 08:37.482
You want?

08:37.482 --> 08:38.985

Universal remote.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.506
Universal remote.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.009
Probably wiped your
ass bare handed

09:03.009 --> 09:05.011
till you came to
this country.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.513
So valery, you got
silvio's money?

09:07.513 --> 09:09.515
Fucking silvio.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.517
Watch it, comrade.

09:11.517 --> 09:15.021
Money is on
entertainment center.

09:19.525 --> 09:22.028
Better not be any
rubles in there.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.530
Put remote on
docking station.

09:24.530 --> 09:25.531

09:26.032 --> 09:28.534
Universal remote...

09:28.534 --> 09:32.038

docking station.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.040

09:38.544 --> 09:39.545
Oops.

09:41.047 --> 09:42.048

09:44.050 --> 09:48.554
Ay, you want to fuck

09:49.055 --> 09:50.556
You come

10:42.608 --> 10:44.610

10:44.610 --> 10:46.612
Must've cracked
his windpipe.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.114
That's it
for him.

10:48.614 --> 10:49.615
What are you, a
fucking doctor now?

10:49.615 --> 10:51.117
What are
we gonna do?

10:51.617 --> 10:54.120
Pull the car around.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.145
"I'm feeling
very sheepish."

11:24.650 --> 11:26.152
About the other day.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.155
I had no right to even
answer your phone.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.158
It's alright.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.661
I'm sorry

12:40.226 --> 12:41.727
Ton', it's me.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.730
We saw that guy,
but we had a problem.

12:44.730 --> 12:47.733
It got a
little physical.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.736
You were just supposed
to pick up the money.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.739
We did, but he started
giving us some shit.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.741

13:15.761 --> 13:17.263

13:17.263 --> 13:19.765
You're breaking up,

13:19.765 --> 13:22.768
I said, are you

13:22.768 --> 13:24.770
It got bad, t,

13:24.770 --> 13:26.772
I'm supposed to

13:26.772 --> 13:28.274
What the fuck

to say to him?

13:28.774 --> 13:31.277
It's okay,
nobody was around.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.779
What do you
wanna do?

13:36.282 --> 13:37.783
You use your
own judgment.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.785
But whatever
you decide,

13:39.785 --> 13:42.288

fuck away from me,
you understand?

13:43.789 --> 13:45.291
Motherfucker!

13:47.293 --> 13:49.295
That was a big
waste of water.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.797
Look, it was just
some work shit, okay?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.802

You like
london broil?

14:13.819 --> 14:15.321
Yeah.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.827
We could dump him
down the shore.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.830
It's too light out
, we should wait.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.335
They got a roy roger

Most important meal.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.851
Let's take him down

It's perfect,

14:48.854 --> 14:50.856
it's fuckin'
deserted down there.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.359
We take him in the
woods, dig a hole,

14:53.359 --> 14:54.860
end of story.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.862
With fuckin' snow
all over the ground?

14:56.862 --> 14:58.864
That's some
hard shit.

14:58.864 --> 15:02.868
I got a shovel i use
for digging the car out.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.371
Best part is, we'll be

15:05.371 --> 15:08.874

15:12.878 --> 15:15.381
This way the day

15:19.885 --> 15:22.888
Things with you and carmel
a seem to be going well.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.391
It's the therapy.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.903
Look, i'm gonna
be honest with you.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.409

15:43.409 --> 15:45.911
A patient of yours.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.416
Gloria trillo.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.419
Why gloria?

15:53.419 --> 15:54.920
Why not?

15:54.920 --> 15:57.423
She's smart, she's

15:57.423 --> 15:58.924
Italian?

15:58.924 --> 16:00.926

16:01.927 --> 16:05.431
What is this,"west

16:05.931 --> 16:08.434
Do you think havin
g met her in therapy

16:08.434 --> 16:10.436
holds any
significance?

16:10.436 --> 16:12.438
Maybe she reminds
me of you.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.440
Okay.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.441
How?

16:15.941 --> 16:17.943

16:21.947 --> 16:24.450
She's actually
nothing like you.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.952
Well...

16:26.952 --> 16:29.455
maybe a little.

16:29.955 --> 16:30.456
Who else then?

16:30.456 --> 16:31.957
You both
got great legs.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.959
Keep joking,
it's your dime.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.461
Don't get jealous.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.463
It was your fault we
met in the first place.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.465
The scheduling
mix- up?

16:39.465 --> 16:42.468
Point is, she
makes me happy.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.474
Does she seem
happy to you?

16:48.474 --> 16:49.975
When she's with me.

16:50.476 --> 16:51.977
And you know what?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.480
So am i.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.486
Do you think lying
to carmela in therapy

17:00.486 --> 17:02.988
is the best thing for
your panic attacks?

17:02.988 --> 17:04.490
Things are going good
between me and carm,

17:04.990 --> 17:06.492
you said so yourself.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.992
Yeah, it's all
predicated on a lie.

17:08.493 --> 17:11.497
Predicated on my ass,
what's the difference?

17:11.497 --> 17:13.499
I'm content,
i'm relaxed.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.502
The bottom line is
i'm a better husband
and a better father.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.505
If you wanna
know the truth...

17:19.505 --> 17:21.507
as much as i
love my wife,

17:21.507 --> 17:24.009
being with gloria
makes me happier

17:24.009 --> 17:26.512
than all your prozac
and your therapy bullshit

17:26.512 --> 17:28.012
combined.

18:10.055 --> 18:11.557
What do
you think?

18:11.557 --> 18:14.059
I think we
should've ate.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.061
Ya!

18:19.064 --> 18:22.067
Cocksucker's
still alive!

18:23.068 --> 18:25.571
Look at
this, he chewed
through the tape.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.574
Fuckin
g piece shit!

18:28.574 --> 18:31.076
Keep hollerin', i'
ll put one in your head.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.078
Fuck you
fucking mother!

18:35.080 --> 18:37.082
Get the shovel,
chrissy.

19:00.606 --> 19:01.607
Fuckin' freezing
out here.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.608
Hey asshole,

19:03.108 --> 19:04.610
don't you know better
than to wear pajamas

19:04.610 --> 19:06.612
in the middle
of winter?

19:09.615 --> 19:12.117
Think this is
far enough?

19:12.117 --> 19:13.118
It'll do.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.622
The fuck
you doing?

19:16.622 --> 19:19.625
You think we're
digging the hole?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.126
That's right,
shit- head,

19:21.126 --> 19:23.128
get to work.

19:23.128 --> 19:25.130
I know
the ground's
kinda hard,

19:25.130 --> 19:27.633
but give it some of
that siberian action.

19:29.635 --> 19:30.636
Shut up.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.652
The fuck's
he saying?

19:46.652 --> 19:48.153
Who gives
a shit.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.655
Keep digging.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.658
Not that it
matters now,

19:52.658 --> 19:55.661
but we didn't come to
your house to kill you.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.163
That mouth
of yours,

19:58.163 --> 20:01.667
you gotta learn to
shut the fuck up.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.169
So, how far is
it to atlantic city?

20:15.180 --> 20:16.181
Motherfucker!

20:22.187 --> 20:24.189
Ah, fuck!

20:46.211 --> 20:47.713
What the fuck?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.715
I got him,
didn't i?

20:49.715 --> 20:51.717
Yeah,
fuck!

20:51.717 --> 20:53.218
Maybe he's
stunned.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.735
How bad is it?

21:10.235 --> 21:12.237
Couple of stitches,
hang on,

21:12.237 --> 21:14.239
we'll finish him up,
we'll cover him with snow.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.241
You see which
way he went?

21:16.742 --> 21:17.743
He's gotta
be close.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.245
Half his head's
probably hanging off.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.247
There's some blood
over there.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.756
Where is
this prick?

21:30.756 --> 21:32.758
You sure i hit
him in the head?

21:33.258 --> 21:35.761
Yeah, fuckin'
positive.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.763
I don't see
any more blood.

21:37.763 --> 21:39.765
It's like the
trail just ended.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.285
Are you gonna be
home for dinner?

22:00.285 --> 22:01.787
Yeah.

22:01.787 --> 22:04.289
Alright, i'm going
to the market.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.294
Maybe it's like
when you cut the
head off a chicken,

22:09.294 --> 22:10.796
how they
keep runnin'.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.301
Fuckin'
believe this?

22:18.303 --> 22:18.804
Hello?

22:19.304 --> 22:20.305
Where the fuck
you been?

22:20.806 --> 22:21.807
We're down the
pine barrens.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.308
Did you wrap
the package?

22:23.308 --> 22:24.810
Not yet.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.312
We were abou
t to, we had a
little problem.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.815
What problem?

22:29.815 --> 22:32.818
The package hit
chrissy with an
implement and ran off.

22:32.818 --> 22:33.819
Ran off?

22:33.819 --> 22:36.822
I thought you said
it was, you know...

22:36.822 --> 22:38.323
we thought it was, t.

22:38.323 --> 22:40.325
It's complicated, we'r
e looking for it now.

22:40.325 --> 22:42.327
I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.329
I said we're
looking for it.

22:44.329 --> 22:46.832
It's like she gets sciatica,
the whole world grinds--

22:46.832 --> 22:48.834
...could surive?

22:48.834 --> 22:50.836
The package?

22:50.836 --> 22:52.838
Is there any way the
package could survive?

22:52.838 --> 22:53.839
Ton'!

22:53.839 --> 22:55.340
Goddamnit!

22:55.340 --> 22:56.842
Is there any
way the package
could survive?

22:56.842 --> 22:59.344
No t, no
fucking way.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.346
It's my life and i
'll live it any way i please.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.348
Cocksucker!

23:03.348 --> 23:04.349
What?

23:04.349 --> 23:05.851
I got a meeting
with slava!

23:05.851 --> 23:08.854
I could be
walking into a
fuckin' buzzsaw!

23:10.355 --> 23:11.857
T, hello?

23:12.858 --> 23:13.859
Fuck.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.360
What'd he say?

23:15.360 --> 23:16.862
I dunno,

23:16.862 --> 23:18.864
he's all fucking worri
ed about this slava asshole.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.366
I know we're doing
work with this guy.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.869
But you gotta wonder
what tony's got going.

23:23.869 --> 23:25.871
None of our fuckin'
business, is it?

23:25.871 --> 23:27.873
I'm a fucking
captain.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.875
You got a match?

23:29.875 --> 23:31.376
My lighter's
in the car.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.878
Mine, too.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.383
I'm not dressed
for this shit.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.887
He's gotta be dead
by now, right?

23:41.887 --> 23:44.890
How could
he not be?

23:44.890 --> 23:46.892
Fuck it,
let's just go.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.894
Squirrels will
eat him anyway.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.896
Where'd we park?

23:50.896 --> 23:52.898
Back there, half
a mile or so.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.901
You sure? 'cause
i thought we kinda
looped around.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.903
Four years in
the army, kid.

23:57.903 --> 24:01.406
We just follow our
own footprints, c'mon.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.425
Wait a minute.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.427
We walked
in a circle.

24:22.928 --> 24:25.430
How's that
fuckin' possible?

24:25.430 --> 24:27.933
Alright, let's
reason this out.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.434
We were
driving south

24:29.935 --> 24:31.937
and the sun's
setting there.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.438
What good's
that do us?

24:33.438 --> 24:35.440
At least we know wha
t direction we're headed.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.442
Yeah, but we're
still fuckin' lost!

24:37.442 --> 24:38.443
We're not lost.

24:38.443 --> 24:39.945
Stop getting cunty.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.453
Slava.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.455
Tony.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.457
Tony, come in.

24:52.457 --> 24:53.959
Come in.

24:54.459 --> 24:55.961
My daughte
r ilana.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.462
Say hello
to mr. Soprano.

24:57.462 --> 24:58.463
Hello.

24:58.463 --> 24:59.965
How you doing?

24:59.965 --> 25:01.967
Go to drugstor
e, buy some candy.

25:06.471 --> 25:07.973
Beautiful girl.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.975
Brilliant student.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.978
One day she goes to
harvard in massachusetts,

25:12.978 --> 25:14.980
maybe.

25:21.486 --> 25:22.988
Family...

25:23.488 --> 25:25.490
nothing is
more important.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.492
That's why you
gotta plan ahead.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.494
There's 200
in here.

25:29.995 --> 25:30.495
Okay.

25:31.997 --> 25:34.499
Same drill
, to isle of man,

25:34.499 --> 25:37.502
four days,
clean as whistle.

25:39.504 --> 25:41.006
We drink.

25:49.514 --> 25:53.018
So, where's
your friend?

25:53.018 --> 25:55.020
Valery?

25:56.021 --> 25:57.522
Who knows?

25:57.522 --> 25:59.524
He give silvio
the money, yes?

25:59.524 --> 26:01.026
'Cause i told him.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.527
I don't know,
i wasn't there.

26:03.028 --> 26:04.029
Salut.

26:11.536 --> 26:14.039
Ho, that's you and
him, ain't it?

26:19.544 --> 26:21.546
He was like
brother to me...

26:23.548 --> 26:25.050
closer than brother.

26:27.552 --> 26:30.055
But now he's
tragic figure.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.057
What do you mean?

26:32.057 --> 26:34.059
The alcohol,
the drugs.

26:34.059 --> 26:37.062
Disgraces to
his family.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.065
He breaks my heart.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.071
Maybe you could
send him to a. A.

26:48.573 --> 26:51.076
In chechnya he
saves my life.

26:59.584 --> 27:00.585
You're...

27:02.087 --> 27:03.588
very emotional.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.594
I would do
anything for him.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.603
Take it ea
sy, we'll find it.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.105
I'm dizzy,

27:20.105 --> 27:22.107
my fuckin' head
is killing me.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.610
Hello?

27:25.610 --> 27:27.612
It's a bad connectio
n so i'm gonna talk fast.

27:28.113 --> 27:31.116
The guy you're looking
for is some kind of
ex- commando or some shit.

27:31.116 --> 27:34.119
He killed 16 chechen
rebels single handed.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.120
T?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.122
T, that you?

27:37.622 --> 27:39.124
Ah, damnit.

27:40.125 --> 27:41.626
I didn't hear
what you said, ton'.

27:42.127 --> 27:44.129
It's a bad connection,
so i'm gonna talk fast.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.630
The guy you're looking
for is an ex- commando.

27:45.630 --> 27:47.632
He killed 16 chechen
rebels single handed.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.634
Get the fu
ck outta here.

27:49.634 --> 27:50.635
Yeah, nice, huh?

27:51.136 --> 27:52.637
He was with the
interior ministry.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.140
Guy's some kind of
russian green beret.

27:56.641 --> 27:58.643
This guy
cannot come back

27:58.643 --> 28:01.646
to tell this story,
you understand?

28:01.646 --> 28:03.148
I hear you.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.649
I'm serious, paulie.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.151

28:10.655 --> 28:12.657
Call me back!

28:14.659 --> 28:17.162
You're not gonna
believe this.

28:17.162 --> 28:20.165
He killed
16 czechoslovakians.

28:20.165 --> 28:23.668
Guy was an
interior decorator.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.171
His house
looked like shit.

28:39.684 --> 28:41.686
Didn't you
hear it?

28:41.686 --> 28:43.688
Twig snappin'.

28:44.189 --> 28:46.191
You said yourself
i hit him in the head.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.693
Fuckin' rasputin,
this guy.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.200
See?

28:56.201 --> 28:58.203
C'mon, he's
running.

29:11.216 --> 29:11.716
Oh!

29:12.217 --> 29:13.718
Oh, fuck!

29:13.718 --> 29:16.221
Fucking cunt!

29:22.227 --> 29:24.729
Paulie, come on,
i think i got him!

29:35.740 --> 29:39.244
If we were trying
we wouldn't have
come close.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.747
I lost my shoe.

29:53.758 --> 29:54.759
Hello?

29:54.759 --> 29:55.260
It's me.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.761
How you feeling?

29:56.761 --> 29:57.762
Like shit.

29:57.762 --> 29:59.264
When are you
coming over?

29:59.264 --> 30:01.266
I gotta get my mother's
car inspected.

30:01.766 --> 30:02.767
At night?

30:03.268 --> 30:04.269
My friend's
a mechanic.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.271
It's the only time
he can do it.

30:06.771 --> 30:08.773
I'm so bummed,
i really miss you.

30:08.773 --> 30:11.276
Can't you do
it tomorrow?

30:11.276 --> 30:12.277
I can't.

30:12.277 --> 30:13.278
My mother

30:13.778 --> 30:15.280

f dov's shit out of here.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.283

30:18.283 --> 30:19.784
Yeah, okay, bye.

30:53.284 --> 30:55.286
This is no
fucking joke here.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.789
I coul
d lose a foot.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.290
It's numb, huh?

30:59.290 --> 31:01.292
The fuck
you think?

31:03.294 --> 31:05.296
How coul
d we be lost
like this?

31:05.296 --> 31:07.799
We're in fucking
new jersey.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.301
South jersey.

31:10.301 --> 31:12.804
Maybe we should eat
some of these berries.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.305
Are you nuts?

31:14.305 --> 31:16.307
Shit like that
could be poisonous
, you don't know.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.309
C'mon.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.315
The fuck's that?

31:26.317 --> 31:28.319
Looks like
a truck.

31:32.323 --> 31:33.324
Ah!

31:33.324 --> 31:35.827
There's fuckin' gravel
under this snow!

31:37.328 --> 31:39.831
The back wheels
are gone.

31:49.340 --> 31:51.342
Thank you, god!

31:51.342 --> 31:53.845
My fucking ears
feel like they're
gonna fall off.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.346
Fuck your ears.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.849
Get me something
for my foot!

32:03.354 --> 32:04.355
Ooh.

32:06.357 --> 32:08.860
Jesus, that pr
ick really brained me.

32:09.861 --> 32:14.365
I gotta sit with m
y foot under my thigh.

32:14.365 --> 32:17.368
Use my own body heat,
that's the trick.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.879
What if this guy's
not dead, paulie?

32:27.879 --> 32:28.880
He's fucking dead.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.382
I know, but 16
czechoslovakians!

32:31.382 --> 32:33.384
He's trained
for this shit.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.887
That's like
"die hard" shit.

32:38.389 --> 32:41.392
I heard on the news
it's supposed to s
now again later this week.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.394
You know the weather
report in mexico?

32:43.394 --> 32:44.896
Chili today,
hot tamale?

32:44.896 --> 32:46.898
You heard it
before?

32:46.898 --> 32:47.899
Hmm.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.400
It's an old
joke, a. J.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.903
Egon kosma said
he made it up.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.411
What's the matter,
you're not hungry?

33:00.912 --> 33:03.414
Late lunch.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.933
Could be him out
there, stalking us.

33:22.433 --> 33:24.435
With wha
t, his cock?

33:24.936 --> 33:26.437
Think about
it, chrissy.

33:26.938 --> 33:27.939
Even if he's alive,

33:27.939 --> 33:30.441
he's unarmed
and bleeding
like a sieve.

33:30.441 --> 33:33.444
He's in the woods,
he's in his pajamas.

33:33.444 --> 33:35.446
It's the fucking
yukon out there.

33:35.446 --> 33:36.948
Probably thinks
we left anyway.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.950
If he's alive,
which he ain't!

33:47.458 --> 33:48.960
What's that?

33:48.960 --> 33:49.961
Nathan's bag.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.963
There's some
ketchups and shit.

33:52.463 --> 33:53.965
They clean?

33:53.965 --> 33:55.466
I dunno, they
were in the bag.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.969
They were a little
half- way frozen.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.471
Fuck it,
gimme some.

34:00.471 --> 34:01.472

34:13.484 --> 34:14.985
Not bad.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.487
Mix it with
the relish.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.491
It's nana
and grandpa.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.996
Ma, what are y
ou guys doing here?

34:24.996 --> 34:26.998
Three hours at
the eye doctor.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.498
Glaucoma.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.501
I may need
an operation.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.003
Oh, my god.

34:33.004 --> 34:35.005
C'mon,
sit down.

34:35.005 --> 34:37.007
You hungry,
you want to eat?

34:37.007 --> 34:39.510
Who could eat after
news like that?

34:39.510 --> 34:41.512
I'll make
some coffee.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.018
Hello.

34:47.518 --> 34:48.518
It's me.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.022
Where are you?

34:52.523 --> 34:54.525
We're still here.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.525
And?

34:56.027 --> 34:57.528
No good.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.030
That's really
fuckin' great.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.532
That language,
is that necessary?

35:02.033 --> 35:04.035
Listen ton',
we're really lost.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.537
We been walking
around for hours.

35:06.537 --> 35:08.539
I lost my shoe.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.541
We found
some old truck.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.043
A truck.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.045
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.546
How'bout some advice?

35:15.546 --> 35:16.547
What?

35:16.547 --> 35:18.049
How'bout
some advice?

35:18.049 --> 35:19.550
You want my advice?

35:19.550 --> 35:21.052
You stay there till
the morning and then
you find this guy.

35:21.552 --> 35:22.553
We're trying!

35:22.553 --> 35:24.555

35:28.559 --> 35:30.561
No, it's just...

35:31.062 --> 35:32.563
your nephew,

35:32.563 --> 35:35.066
sometimes he don't
think before he acts.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.567
That's all
i'm gonna say.

35:36.567 --> 35:39.070
I thought the guy
sucker punched you.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.071
He did.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.572
It's just...

35:42.073 --> 35:44.075
we'll talk later.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.087
You're having
coffee, right?

35:58.089 --> 36:01.092
My father

36:08.599 --> 36:10.601

36:12.103 --> 36:13.604

36:55.146 --> 36:56.647
I'm sorry.

36:58.149 --> 37:00.151
Something came up.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.153

37:14.665 --> 37:16.667

37:17.168 --> 37:19.170
Inconsiderate prick.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.672
I said i
was sorry.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.677
It was
family shit.

37:27.678 --> 37:29.680
It couldn't
be avoided.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.685
Let me make it
up to you.

37:34.685 --> 37:38.189
You were supposed
to be here three

37:40.691 --> 37:43.194
I'm here now

37:45.696 --> 37:47.198
Hmm?

38:16.227 --> 38:18.229

got it himself!

38:23.734 --> 38:25.736
Cocksucker got
the sniffles,

38:25.736 --> 38:27.738

stuck out here!

38:28.239 --> 38:29.240
You shouldn't

38:29.240 --> 38:31.742
I shouldn't have
even been there!

38:32.743 --> 38:34.245

38:38.249 --> 38:40.751
You had to hear him
on the phone before.

38:40.751 --> 38:43.254
Talking to me
like a child.

38:43.254 --> 38:46.257
You have any idea
the money i made for
him over the years?

38:46.257 --> 38:48.259
Or his old man
before him?

38:48.259 --> 38:51.262
He's living like

38:51.262 --> 38:54.765
and now all i hear about

38:55.266 --> 38:57.268

39:10.781 --> 39:12.283
A plan?

39:12.283 --> 39:13.784
We're in a

39:13.784 --> 39:15.786
It had to get
here somehow,

39:15.786 --> 39:17.288

39:17.288 --> 39:19.790

leaving me here.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.796
You don't trust me?

39:25.796 --> 39:27.298
It's stupid,

39:27.298 --> 39:28.799
And what's
your fucking plan?

39:28.799 --> 39:29.800

40:09.340 --> 40:10.341
Hey, take it easy!

40:10.341 --> 40:11.842

40:11.842 --> 40:13.344
We're fucking

40:13.344 --> 40:14.845
What do you want

40:15.346 --> 40:16.847
Come fucking

40:17.348 --> 40:19.350
You don't even know

40:19.350 --> 40:20.351
Exit 12.

40:20.851 --> 40:21.352

40:21.852 --> 40:23.354
Exit fuckin' 12.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.355
Pike's hollow
or some shit.

40:24.355 --> 40:25.856
Pike's hollow.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.858
There's a dirt roa
d at the turnoff.

40:27.858 --> 40:29.360
We're parked
about a mile in

40:29.860 --> 40:30.861
near some
picnic tables.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.863
And when i find the

40:32.863 --> 40:34.865
I don't know,
start yellin'!

40:34.865 --> 40:35.866
We're in a truck.

40:35.866 --> 40:38.869
That dirt road might be
the same one we're on.

40:38.869 --> 40:41.872
Put my nephew
on the phone.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.376
Here.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.877
Yeah, t.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.379

40:48.379 --> 40:49.880
I don't know, my
head's killing me.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.382
I can't hear you.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.384
My head hurts,
i think i got
a concussion.

40:53.384 --> 40:56.387
Alright,

40:56.887 --> 40:58.389
Bring some food,

40:59.890 --> 41:02.893
Alright,

41:06.397 --> 41:09.900
I gotta go.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.402
What, are you
kidding me?

41:11.402 --> 41:12.903
It's an emergency.

41:14.405 --> 41:15.906
What do you
want from me?

41:16.407 --> 41:18.409
What do you
think, i'm some
fucking whore?

41:18.409 --> 41:19.910
Just calm down.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.912
You think you're
just gonna come over
here and fuck me?

41:21.912 --> 41:24.415
You know what?
I don't got time
for this shit.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.917
Oh, now you're gonna leave,
you low- life piece of shit!

41:26.917 --> 41:27.918
You know

41:27.918 --> 41:29.920
Take your
fucking dinner!

41:44.935 --> 41:46.937
I fucking
hate you!

42:00.951 --> 42:03.454
I know he's
cheating on me.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.456
I could hear it
in his voice.

42:05.956 --> 42:07.458
Car inspection?

42:07.458 --> 42:08.959
It's bullshit.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.467
What if he's
not though?

42:16.467 --> 42:18.969
Doing this would make
me as bad as he is.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.972
Maybe we
should go.

42:28.479 --> 42:29.480
Hey.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.482
Sorry i had
to wake you.

42:32.983 --> 42:34.485
Fucking chemo.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.987
I'm awake throwing
up half the night anyway.

42:37.988 --> 42:39.490
Did you
call bobby?

42:39.990 --> 42:41.492
He's on his way.

42:42.993 --> 42:44.995
What've you
been eating, steak?

42:44.995 --> 42:46.497
No--

42:46.997 --> 42:48.499
i dunno.

42:48.499 --> 42:51.502
I need to
borrow a shirt.

42:51.502 --> 42:52.503
You want
some tea?

42:52.503 --> 42:54.004
No.

43:12.022 --> 43:13.524
Fuck this!

43:13.524 --> 43:16.527
Where you going?

43:16.527 --> 43:19.530
It's not bad enough
you wake me in the
middle of the night.

43:19.530 --> 43:22.032
I gotta get my balls
broken too?

43:22.032 --> 43:24.535
Go with my nephew,
do what he says.

43:28.539 --> 43:30.541
I gotta
change my shirt.

43:34.044 --> 43:36.046
I got my limits
too, jr.

43:41.552 --> 43:43.053
Be strong.

43:50.060 --> 43:52.062
You have a good time?

43:52.062 --> 43:53.564
Me, too.

43:53.564 --> 43:56.567
What are you
doing tomorrow?

43:56.567 --> 43:59.570
Yeah, of
course i did.

43:59.570 --> 44:01.572
I can't believe
you did this to me.

44:01.572 --> 44:03.574
What are you
doing here?

44:03.574 --> 44:04.575
I loved you.

44:04.575 --> 44:05.576
Who the hell
are you?

44:06.076 --> 44:07.077
Fuck you,
bitch.

44:07.077 --> 44:08.078
What'd you say?

44:08.078 --> 44:09.580
Don't ever
call me again!

44:09.580 --> 44:11.081
Meadow, wait.

44:14.084 --> 44:16.086
Yeah, you better
leave, bitch!

44:20.090 --> 44:22.092
What the fuck is the
matter with you?

44:22.092 --> 44:23.594
That's tony soprano's
daughter!

44:23.594 --> 44:26.096
Oh, what do

44:26.597 --> 44:28.599
Fuckin' bitch.

44:28.599 --> 44:30.100

44:33.103 --> 44:35.606
You really know
about this shit?

44:35.606 --> 44:38.108
The woods
and hunting?

44:39.610 --> 44:41.111
My dad and me used
to go every year.

44:43.614 --> 44:46.617
I'm sorry i laughe
d at you before.

44:46.617 --> 44:49.119
It's alright.

44:49.119 --> 44:52.122
One time we
went hunting...

44:53.123 --> 44:55.626
we saw a sign that
said,"bear left,"

44:55.626 --> 44:57.628
so we went home.

45:04.635 --> 45:08.138
I want you to know
i appreciate you
taking care of my uncle.

45:08.138 --> 45:10.140
Yeah, i know.

45:11.642 --> 45:14.144
He really loves you,
you know that?

45:14.144 --> 45:15.646
C'mon, that old prick?

45:15.646 --> 45:17.147
I'm serious.

45:17.147 --> 45:19.149
He talks about
you all the time.

45:19.650 --> 45:22.653
I know you had your
problems but, i dunno...

45:24.655 --> 45:27.157
i wish he was my
uncle sometimes.

45:41.171 --> 45:43.173
What time is it?

45:47.678 --> 45:48.679
4:30.

45:52.182 --> 45:54.685
Where the
fuck is he?

45:56.687 --> 45:58.689
What are those,
tic- tacs?

45:58.689 --> 46:00.691
I just found'em.

46:00.691 --> 46:02.192
I didn't know
i had'em on me.

46:02.192 --> 46:04.194
You had tic- tacs all
along? Give me some!

46:04.194 --> 46:06.697
There ain't no
more, i ate'em.

46:06.697 --> 46:08.198
Selfish prick,
i'm dying here!

46:08.198 --> 46:09.700
Then fucking

46:09.700 --> 46:12.202
Where you going
? don't go out there!

46:12.202 --> 46:13.704
I'm eating
those berries.

46:13.704 --> 46:15.205
I'm telling you,
they're poison!

46:15.205 --> 46:17.207
I don't give a
shit, at least i
won't die hungry.

46:39.730 --> 46:42.232
You sure this is
the right place?

46:42.232 --> 46:43.734
Yeah,
pike's hollow.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.736
One mile in, by
the picnic table.

46:45.736 --> 46:47.237
Where's their
car, though?

46:47.237 --> 46:49.239
Maybe they left.

46:49.239 --> 46:50.741
They wouldn't leave
without calling.

46:50.741 --> 46:53.243
Let me try
him again.

47:02.753 --> 47:03.754
Tony?

47:03.754 --> 47:07.758
Paulie, we're by the...

47:07.758 --> 47:09.259

cocksucker!

47:15.265 --> 47:18.268

47:18.769 --> 47:20.771
I don't know!

47:29.780 --> 47:30.781
Ho!

47:31.281 --> 47:33.283
Do that by
your own window!

47:33.283 --> 47:34.785
I don't wanna
smell your piss.

47:34.785 --> 47:35.786
Fuck you.

47:35.786 --> 47:37.287

47:37.287 --> 47:38.288
You heardme.

47:38.789 --> 47:40.290
Don't make me pull
rank on you, kid.

47:40.290 --> 47:42.292
Fuck you,
paulie.

47:42.292 --> 47:43.794
Captain
or no captain,

47:44.294 --> 47:46.296

just two assho
les lost in the woods.

47:46.296 --> 47:49.299
Do yourself a favor,
chrissy and go back
to fucking sleep!

47:49.299 --> 47:50.801
Why, so you could
choke me?

47:50.801 --> 47:51.802
What?

47:51.802 --> 47:53.303
You thin
k i'm stupid.

47:53.303 --> 47:55.806
I heard you on
the phone trying to
blame this on me.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.809
The fuck you

47:58.809 --> 48:00.811
You fucked up wi
th the russian prick,

48:00.811 --> 48:02.312

48:02.312 --> 48:03.814
You'll wai

48:04.314 --> 48:05.816

48:06.316 --> 48:07.818
Choke you right

48:07.818 --> 48:10.821
I'll leave you here,

48:10.821 --> 48:12.322
Put it down,
chrissy.

48:12.823 --> 48:14.324
You know how fast
i can run.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.326
I'll leave you
in the fucking dust!

48:16.827 --> 48:18.328
All the shit

48:18.829 --> 48:20.330
You think i'd
really kill you?

48:20.330 --> 48:21.832
Yeah, i do.

48:40.851 --> 48:43.353
Promise me you won't
leave me here.

48:45.355 --> 48:47.357
I'm not gonna
leave you.

48:55.866 --> 48:58.368
Paulie!

48:58.368 --> 49:00.871
Christopher!

49:03.373 --> 49:05.375
What do you think,
what should we do?

49:05.375 --> 49:07.377
There's nothing
we can do.

49:07.878 --> 49:09.880
We'll wait
till it's light,

49:09.880 --> 49:11.882
then we'll
head in.

49:21.391 --> 49:23.393
1- 0- 1.

49:23.393 --> 49:25.395
Let's get some
fluids in you,

49:25.395 --> 49:26.897
we'll send you
home later.

49:28.899 --> 49:31.401
Oh, my god,
are you okay?

49:31.902 --> 49:34.905
She was out
all night, i
couldn't stop her.

49:34.905 --> 49:36.406
It's over.

49:36.406 --> 49:39.409
He was cheating on me.

49:39.409 --> 49:40.911
Holy shit.

49:40.911 --> 49:43.413
We drove out
to jersey,

49:43.413 --> 49:44.915
i caught them together.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.917
She was a real
whore, too.

49:46.917 --> 49:48.919
Oh, my god.

49:48.919 --> 49:50.921
That's horrible.

49:50.921 --> 49:52.923
It's all
my fault.

49:53.423 --> 49:55.425
I shouldn't
have pressured
him like that.

49:55.425 --> 49:57.427
You're bet
ter off without
him, meadow.

49:57.427 --> 49:58.428
I mean
, he was cute,

49:58.929 --> 50:00.430
but he was
really boring.

50:00.430 --> 50:02.432
You didn't know
him like i did.

50:02.432 --> 50:04.434
You don't know what it's like
to grow up where we did!

50:04.434 --> 50:06.937
Whatever, mead,
he was such a drip.

50:06.937 --> 50:09.439
No, me wasn't,
he was great!

50:28.959 --> 50:31.461
Bruno magli
over here.

50:53.483 --> 50:55.986
Which way, wha
t do you think?

50:55.986 --> 50:57.988
Don't matter
to me.

50:57.988 --> 51:00.490
I ain't stopping
till we hit cement.

51:14.504 --> 51:17.007
A lotta strange
people used to
live in these woods.

51:18.008 --> 51:19.509
Jackson whites,

51:20.010 --> 51:22.512
these weird
looking albinos.

51:24.514 --> 51:26.016
Paulie!

51:26.516 --> 51:28.518
Christopher!

51:32.022 --> 51:34.524
First place i'm
hitting is denny's.

51:34.524 --> 51:36.026
I know.

51:36.026 --> 51:38.528
Get like five of those
grand slam breakfasts.

51:43.533 --> 51:44.534
Shit!

51:46.536 --> 51:48.038
What's the matter?

51:48.038 --> 51:51.041
Fucking thing'

52:03.553 --> 52:05.555
Motherfucker!

52:10.560 --> 52:12.562
What are
you doing?

52:12.562 --> 52:15.065
What if we need
the bullets?

52:15.065 --> 52:17.067
That's n
o deer hunter.

52:18.068 --> 52:19.569
Paulie!

52:19.569 --> 52:20.570
Christopher!

52:29.079 --> 52:30.580
Tony!

52:30.580 --> 52:31.581
Over here!

52:32.082 --> 52:34.584
Over here!

52:34.584 --> 52:36.586
Paulie!

52:36.586 --> 52:38.088
Where are you?

52:41.091 --> 52:43.593
Over here, tony!

52:56.106 --> 52:58.108
Thank fuckin' god!

52:58.108 --> 53:01.111
You guys
alright?

53:01.111 --> 53:03.613
What the f
uck you shootin' at?

53:03.613 --> 53:05.615
Nothing,
never mind.

53:06.116 --> 53:08.118
Jesus christ,
look at you two!

53:08.618 --> 53:11.121
All night in this
fuckin' hell hole.

53:12.622 --> 53:14.124
Alright, c'mon.

53:17.627 --> 53:19.129
C'mon, easy.

53:32.142 --> 53:34.144
Is this
the spot?

53:34.144 --> 53:35.645
Yeah, but...

53:35.645 --> 53:37.647
my fucking
car's gone.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.150
You sure this is
where you left it?

53:40.150 --> 53:41.651
I'm positive.

53:41.651 --> 53:43.653
Is the
heat on?

53:52.162 --> 53:55.165
Jesus christ, i
can't feel my toes.

53:55.665 --> 53:57.167
You got any
blankets?

53:57.167 --> 53:58.668
No, sorry.

53:58.668 --> 54:00.170
Turn up the
heat, huh?

54:03.173 --> 54:05.175
I can't
believe it,

54:05.675 --> 54:07.677
i fuckin'
loved that car.

54:07.677 --> 54:09.179
Probably kids
or something.

54:09.179 --> 54:10.680
What if it
was the guy?

54:12.682 --> 54:14.684
You got the money?

54:16.186 --> 54:19.189
It was in the car.

54:19.189 --> 54:21.191
That's all i asked
you to do, paulie.

54:21.191 --> 54:23.693
I'm sorry, t, it
couldn't be helped.

54:23.693 --> 54:26.196
The guy fuckin'
lunged at us.

54:30.200 --> 54:33.203
Listen, ton', i know
i fucked up, but--

54:33.703 --> 54:35.705
it's okay,
really.

54:35.705 --> 54:37.207
Just forget it.

54:39.209 --> 54:41.211
What do you think,

54:41.711 --> 54:43.713
you wanna look for
this guy or what?

54:43.713 --> 54:45.215
You tell me.

54:45.715 --> 54:46.716
Is it worth it?

54:46.716 --> 54:47.717
I hit him in
the head, ton'.

54:48.218 --> 54:49.719
I saw it with
my own eyes.

54:51.221 --> 54:53.723
Is it possible this fu
ck made it outta here alive?

54:53.723 --> 54:55.225
It's hard to say.

54:55.225 --> 54:58.228
Flesh wound maybe,
head shot, i don't know.

54:58.228 --> 55:01.231
On the other hand,
anything's possible.

55:06.236 --> 55:08.238
You're a captain,

55:08.238 --> 55:10.240
what do you wanna do?

55:21.751 --> 55:24.254
Fuck it,
let's go home.

55:25.255 --> 55:26.256
Alright.

55:26.256 --> 55:29.259
But let's be clear
on this right now.

55:29.259 --> 55:31.761
If this cocksucker
crawls out from
under a rock

55:31.761 --> 55:34.264
he's your problem,
not mine.

55:34.264 --> 55:36.266
You deal with slava,
you take the heat,

55:36.266 --> 55:38.268
you pay the price.

55:39.269 --> 55:40.270
Capisce?

55:42.772 --> 55:43.773
Fine.

56:11.301 --> 56:14.304
You got mayonnaise
on your chin.

56:14.304 --> 56:15.805
What?

56:15.805 --> 56:18.808
Mayonnaise,
mayonnaise!

56:50.340 --> 56:52.342
I'm telling
you, something's
fucked up here.

56:52.342 --> 56:53.343
Because one minute
she's fine,

56:53.843 --> 56:56.346
next minute she's a
fuckin' lunatic!

56:56.346 --> 56:58.848
I asked you
whether or not

56:58.848 --> 57:00.850
she seemed like
a happy person.

57:00.850 --> 57:02.352
Oh, and by tha
t i'm supposed to know

57:02.352 --> 57:04.854
she's gonna throw
a fuckin' roast
beef at my head?

57:05.855 --> 57:09.859
Read into things
however you choose.

57:15.365 --> 57:18.368
Why does everything
gotta be so hard?

57:19.869 --> 57:21.871
I'm not saying
i'm perfect,

57:21.871 --> 57:24.374
but i do the right
thing by my family.

57:26.376 --> 57:28.878
Doesn't that
count for anything?

57:32.382 --> 57:34.884
I think we
should discuss

57:34.884 --> 57:37.387
what attracted you to
gloria in the first place.

57:37.887 --> 57:39.389
We been through
that already.

57:39.889 --> 57:43.393
And irina
before her.

57:43.393 --> 57:46.896
Depressive
personality,
unstable,

57:46.896 --> 57:49.399
impossible to please.

57:52.902 --> 57:55.905
Does that remind you
of any other woman?
