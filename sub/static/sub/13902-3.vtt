WEBVTT

00:25.049 --> 00:27.156
...and condoms.

00:36.877 --> 00:39.660
I always use black cabs,
not many cabs.

00:39.742 --> 00:42.401
But at least you get a different
driver each time.

00:42.466 --> 00:44.846
They know what I'm up to,
and I know they know.

00:44.905 --> 00:49.101
It's just a game we play.

00:52.436 --> 00:54.724
Everything in here is important.

00:54.994 --> 00:59.021
But the only essential thing on an
all-night-job is this...

01:01.387 --> 01:03.650
A lot can happen on an all-nighter.

01:44.504 --> 01:48.517
The biggest grown market in escorting is
something called the "girlfriend experience".

01:48.599 --> 01:51.511
Now, that doesn't mean, getting paid to
be rude and to force him

01:51.593 --> 01:53.979
trying to work out what's wrong, no

01:54.411 --> 01:56.780
This is a particular service.

01:57.267 --> 02:00.092
I've never been a very good
girlfriend in real life.

02:00.139 --> 02:01.952
But for one night only,

02:02.070 --> 02:04.782
I am the perfect girlfriend.

02:07.306 --> 02:10.453
Some of my clients, theyÂ’re
not just after sex.

02:10.536 --> 02:14.633
They want the intimacy, the exclusivity
of a real relationship.

02:15.354 --> 02:18.723
What's wrong with that? We
all want to be held.

02:19.219 --> 02:23.951
So it's 7:30 and from this moment on,
I'm on the client's time.

02:24.092 --> 02:27.825
His treat for the night,
a gift to himself.

02:27.966 --> 02:29.618
Ashop Prissad.

02:29.723 --> 02:31.411
My first.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.410
I lost my virginity to him...

02:33.528 --> 02:35.207
professionally speaking.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.322
Sweet, clean, considerate.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.931
So I kept him.

02:39.037 --> 02:40.798
My perfect regular.

02:42.312 --> 02:43.416
- Hey.
- Hello.

02:43.604 --> 02:45.130
Couldn't you have brushed your hair?

02:45.224 --> 02:47.694
Couldn't you have bought a new suit.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.625
Oh. There you go.

02:54.872 --> 02:57.101
Oh, yeah! Great, thanks.

02:57.314 --> 03:00.034
Of course, they cancelled that.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.110
Officially, the most depressing
book I've ever read.

03:03.228 --> 03:05.059
Can't ask for from that.

03:05.247 --> 03:06.251
So?

03:07.314 --> 03:08.317
Usual?

03:09.016 --> 03:10.132
Lovely, thanks.

03:15.973 --> 03:17.370
Yeah, he's married.

03:17.852 --> 03:20.376
But his wife hasn't had sex with
him for 5 years so...

03:20.470 --> 03:24.010
suppose they're both breaking
the marriage contract.

03:24.948 --> 03:26.872
- There you go.
- Thank you.

03:27.619 --> 03:30.111
Ooh! I love your lipstick!

03:31.203 --> 03:32.859
You never...

03:32.906 --> 03:34.385
There you go.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.262
- You look lovely.
- You look pretty good yourself.

03:37.363 --> 03:38.396
Shell we?

03:42.326 --> 03:45.731
Sometimes, on these occasions,
the client will take me out.

03:45.942 --> 03:50.482
Maybe a film or a western play but
I never get to see the second half.

03:50.673 --> 03:53.011
You see, most clients are like Ash,

03:53.163 --> 03:54.595
just too excited.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.443
I thought, we've had upstairs an order
room service if, uh,...

03:58.866 --> 04:00.204
if that's okay.

04:08.157 --> 04:11.486
1500 good reasons to do the night shift.

04:11.821 --> 04:14.369
Next job: get the client his fast orgasm,

04:14.404 --> 04:17.023
get those endorphins flowing.
He relaxes,

04:17.202 --> 04:19.584
and I can pace out for
the rest of the evening.

04:24.477 --> 04:26.330
How was your shower?

04:26.706 --> 04:27.971
Good.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.440
- Still sore?
- Bit.

04:32.451 --> 04:34.869
Maybe I can help you with that.

04:53.289 --> 04:57.086
1 orgasm down, 10 hours to go.

04:57.121 --> 05:00.939
An South-African Chenet Blanc, thank you.

05:05.451 --> 05:07.905
So, how we're gonna spend
the rest of the night?

05:21.805 --> 05:24.750
I mean, just the way he walked
on the office pisses me off.

05:24.751 --> 05:25.948
Smiling all the time.

05:25.949 --> 05:28.305
Never trust an Isegrim.

05:28.557 --> 05:32.554
The 3 rules of conversation in the escort
client relationship. Number 1:

05:32.555 --> 05:35.272
So, Ash, global warming,

05:35.273 --> 05:38.135
will it eventually lead to an apocalypse?

05:39.041 --> 05:40.498
Keep it lined.

05:40.499 --> 05:43.770
Tell me, can a revitalised Tory
party ever really

05:43.771 --> 05:45.371
win over the northern bureau?

05:47.084 --> 05:48.562
No politics!

05:48.795 --> 05:50.980
And perhaps the most important of all...

05:51.003 --> 05:52.694
Does your wife know you take out...

05:52.695 --> 05:55.085
No inflamentary topics.

05:55.086 --> 05:56.588
And the people like us,

05:56.589 --> 05:58.749
we really should be in charge of everything.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.736
Yeah... they'd surely will do.

06:50.543 --> 06:55.501
I know it will sound odd, but I never
actually sleep with clients.

07:22.925 --> 07:23.973
Hello?

07:23.974 --> 07:26.542
- I'm bored.
- I'm on level 4.

07:26.543 --> 07:28.114
You bastard!

07:28.149 --> 07:30.085
How did you get through the concert?

07:30.086 --> 07:32.500
Skill and general excellence, my friend.

07:32.501 --> 07:34.536
So go on, how was the gig?

07:34.537 --> 07:35.984
It wasn't a gig, exactly.

07:35.985 --> 07:40.423
It was more like a electric-acoustic
performance piece.

07:40.424 --> 07:43.438
Fuckin' no, you poor, poor bastard.

07:43.439 --> 07:46.352
I know. God, I played the same
thing for 2,5 hours.

07:46.353 --> 07:47.946
At one point, I thought he was dead.

07:47.947 --> 07:49.374
Oh, nice work!

07:49.375 --> 07:51.338
Ah, Vanessa says "hi", by the way.

07:51.339 --> 07:53.157
Oh, yeah, sure she does.

07:54.757 --> 07:56.218
God, I'm bored. Entertain me.

07:56.318 --> 07:58.040
I'd know what you office tarts do.

07:58.041 --> 08:01.089
Play with your hole-punch.
Photocopy your arse.

08:02.136 --> 08:03.573
<i>You should listen, I gotta go.</i>

08:03.574 --> 08:04.297
Yeah, me too.

08:04.298 --> 08:07.273
- I gotta speak tomorrow to you.
- Alright, it'll be breakfast.

08:08.725 --> 08:09.573
Ben?

09:01.206 --> 09:03.601
Ash, gone for cigarettes.
Won't be long.

09:33.563 --> 09:37.887
Yes Madam, I'll serve between 7 and 10
in the hotel restaurant which is on the 4th floor.

09:37.888 --> 09:39.415
Thank you.

09:41.253 --> 09:43.825
Room 302. Very nice lady.

09:43.826 --> 09:48.398
- Nice, yes. Lady, no.
- No, no, no, no.

09:48.399 --> 09:50.752
- She's a tranny.
- No, I don't believe you.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.747
- A scar.
- What?

09:54.191 --> 09:55.893
No Adam's apple.

09:58.279 --> 10:00.283
Alright, start a question.

10:00.628 --> 10:02.492
Couple coming down the stairs.

10:02.493 --> 10:07.249
Uh, you want me to say "mother and son".

10:07.250 --> 10:11.623
- By the way, he's touching her hip. They're clearly lovers.
- And?

10:11.624 --> 10:14.826
And from the bags under her eyes,
I'd say she's a mum.

10:14.827 --> 10:17.028
Girl, you are on form tonight.

10:17.373 --> 10:19.534
Room 242, married with kids.

10:19.698 --> 10:21.871
Left me in charge of that child.

10:22.598 --> 10:24.312
Baby listening service.

10:24.412 --> 10:26.162
Gay you, Marry Poppins.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.310
Right. I'm gonna get a beer.

10:45.984 --> 10:47.309
Hope, you don't mind me asking,

10:47.616 --> 10:49.248
but... do I know?

10:50.462 --> 10:53.723
- No, I don't think so. No.
- Are you on TV?

10:53.823 --> 10:55.350
Or a model?

10:55.537 --> 10:57.504
It's just, you seem very familiar.

10:57.604 --> 10:59.835
I'm quite well-known in certain circles.

11:00.085 --> 11:01.709
- Really?
- Really.

11:02.586 --> 11:04.039
Actually...

11:04.139 --> 11:05.793
I'm looking for a bit fun,

11:06.086 --> 11:08.165
and I think you are too.

11:10.149 --> 11:13.332
- Sorry, not tonight.
- So why not tonight?

11:13.614 --> 11:16.573
You're here, I'm here...

11:18.071 --> 11:21.024
Normally the agency's got supplies
part on investigation.

11:21.124 --> 11:23.292
I'm gonna have to do my own tricks.

11:24.222 --> 11:28.273
The body language:
confident, cocky even.

11:28.637 --> 11:31.652
Shoes: Rosetti.
The watch: RS.

11:32.290 --> 11:35.762
This is a man who knows what he wants,
so you should be quick into the

11:35.903 --> 11:37.359
So...

11:37.524 --> 11:39.575
what's it gonna be?

11:40.107 --> 11:41.874
Wait here a moment.

11:41.974 --> 11:44.879
- What room you're in?
- 914.

11:45.477 --> 11:47.743
- This baby monitor.
- Yeah?

11:47.848 --> 11:50.223
- How does it work?
- Through the phones.

11:51.196 --> 11:53.352
I need it. Room 504.

11:53.457 --> 11:55.447
They've been fed so there
won't be any problems.

11:55.731 --> 11:57.497
I'll be in room 914, on this
occasion you'll need me.

11:57.597 --> 12:00.609
You're moonlighting!
You're a bad girl!

12:00.709 --> 12:02.173
I know!

12:06.797 --> 12:09.770
What? I've always been a good fatale.

12:31.127 --> 12:34.541
I want you to take off your corset.

12:37.378 --> 12:39.762
You're very directive.

12:40.364 --> 12:41.791
I like that.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.553
In charge.

12:51.121 --> 12:52.800
And your stockings.

12:53.556 --> 12:55.222
Slower.

12:56.053 --> 12:57.856
It's usually my role...

12:57.956 --> 13:00.150
to tell people what to do.

13:22.185 --> 13:24.205
I wanna watch you come.

13:38.742 --> 13:39.980
What you reckon?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.589
Oh, it's good. You're good at it.

13:50.841 --> 13:52.978
Did New York last year.

13:53.095 --> 13:55.213
3 hours, 41 minutes.

13:55.954 --> 13:58.819
- Pardon?
- Marathon.

13:59.556 --> 14:00.859
Helps with that...

14:00.965 --> 14:02.715
sexual stamina.

14:02.815 --> 14:04.853
Yeah, I can see that.

14:10.756 --> 14:12.359
Everyone always, uh,

14:12.459 --> 14:15.793
I can just go on, and on, and on, yeah...

14:16.557 --> 14:17.502
and on...

14:17.602 --> 14:19.601
- That's good.
- Yeah.

14:29.596 --> 14:31.234
What do I do?

14:33.752 --> 14:35.373
Who's your daddy?

14:50.445 --> 14:53.556
If you ask them first, 90%
of them all say "no".

14:53.697 --> 14:55.700
but, hey, once he's up...

15:12.897 --> 15:13.821
Was...

15:13.965 --> 15:14.813
different.

15:16.517 --> 15:19.461
Sure, I can't get you a
drink before you go?

15:19.497 --> 15:20.571
No, no, fine, thank you.

15:20.807 --> 15:21.880
- Sure?
- Yeah.

15:22.765 --> 15:23.790
I had...

15:24.216 --> 15:25.901
I had a wonderful time tonight.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.020
Really.

15:27.355 --> 15:28.380
So did I.

15:37.016 --> 15:39.933
He wants me to tell him that he's
different from all the rest.

15:40.825 --> 15:44.311
All clients think they're special, the only one.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.943
And the truth is, he is the only one.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.462
The only one on this floor.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.195
Morning.

18:21.800 --> 18:22.738
Morning.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.908
God, I slept well.

18:29.993 --> 18:30.926
We should get up,

18:32.050 --> 18:33.305
have breakfast...

18:37.951 --> 18:39.128
Can I skip it up?

18:42.791 --> 18:44.765
The last job of the all-nighter.

18:45.841 --> 18:47.718
Well, it'd be rude not to.

18:50.383 --> 18:51.315
Thank you, Belle.

18:51.502 --> 18:55.235
- For, you know, everything.
- My pleasure.

18:55.272 --> 18:56.308
I will call you, yeah?

18:56.382 --> 18:58.987
Might as change the day, my wife's got
her tonsils removed on Wednesday.

18:59.022 --> 19:00.896
When that's finished,
just let me know.

19:03.841 --> 19:04.586
See ya.

19:23.991 --> 19:25.268
Is that you, darling?

19:25.341 --> 19:28.986
Yeah, time for us night hawks to crawl under
the rocks from where we have come.

19:29.041 --> 19:30.868
Beautiful said! There you go.

19:30.890 --> 19:32.028
Don't do that...

19:32.211 --> 19:34.166
No, no, it's fine. I couldn't have
done it without you.

19:34.272 --> 19:37.046
- It's all part of the service.
- All part of the service...

19:41.802 --> 19:45.035
Maybe the "girlfriend experience" is
like me as a real girlfriend.

19:45.331 --> 19:48.015
Starts out all exciting and passionate,

19:48.251 --> 19:50.746
then I get bored, sleep with
someone else and leave.

20:04.442 --> 20:06.176
So that's it. The all-nighter.

20:06.783 --> 20:10.137
You play some games, you read a
book, you find a friend.

20:10.211 --> 20:13.248
and during the small hours, one that
you're won't enjoy in bed,

20:13.431 --> 20:16.027
you do everybody else does when
they're on the night shift.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.867
You think of the money!

20:21.861 --> 20:23.025
Good morning, Benjamin.

20:25.681 --> 20:27.177
Alright, and how are you?

20:33.224 --> 20:35.396

20:35.580 --> 20:37.468
Being an escort involves pain.

20:37.692 --> 20:39.768
But sometimes pain can be pleasure.

20:40.090 --> 20:42.498
Now get off the carpet, you disgust me!

20:42.681 --> 20:44.037
You do this job long enough,

20:44.181 --> 20:46.015
you wanna kick the shit out of him, eventually.

20:47.131 --> 20:49.067
Are you going to do whatever I tell you?

20:49.392 --> 20:51.986
I'm sleeping with this bloke
who's quite into S/M.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.276
And then do the kitchen.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.685
I can't even come around your flat anymore.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.838
This isn't about you. Deal with it.
