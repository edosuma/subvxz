drinking, didn't I?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.380
- Hard head make a soft ass, Noah.
- No, first of all,

09:19.400 --> 09:21.890
you got it all twisted;
you work for me!

09:21.920 --> 09:24.201
It ain't the other way around.
You better know your place.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.240
- My place?
- All right? Yeah, your place.

09:26.260 --> 09:27.920
You need to sit your ass down.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.560
You know what?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.000
You're fired.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.360
I have to call you back, Doctor.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.500
He better be prescribing
you some damn sense.

09:40.540 --> 09:43.310
You can't be here. We're still
trying to calm the scandal.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.650
My board is starting to believe
some of this nonsense,

09:46.680 --> 09:49.880
and they want to kick me out
of Floyd Entertainment.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.350
But if that jackass Trump
can win, so can I.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.660
Besides...

09:55.690 --> 09:58.330
who's gonna run this company?

09:58.660 --> 10:00.260
You?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.060
_

10:09.140 --> 10:10.686
How about this? Tell
us how you guys met.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.370
- How we met?
- Huh.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.499
We were born... out the same...

10:14.500 --> 10:15.756
We were born from the same womb.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.810
We've told this story
so many times,

10:17.850 --> 10:20.920
but I was on, um, the
Gram doing covers,

10:20.940 --> 10:23.120
kind of like everybody
else, and I was hoping

10:23.140 --> 10:24.280
to meet a dope songwriter.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.950
That's how I met Alex.

10:25.990 --> 10:29.400
Yeah. I wasn't as confident
in my music as I am now.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.959
But Star was one of
the first people

10:31.960 --> 10:33.179
that made me feel
like I could make it

10:33.180 --> 10:35.200
- in the industry.
- That's dope.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.260
You guys got a lot of
individual success

10:37.300 --> 10:38.360
as well as group success.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.800
Alex, I'm checking
out "So Sick."

10:40.840 --> 10:43.640
I think it's literally <i> so sick.</i>

10:43.670 --> 10:45.980
And, Star, "There For You,"

10:46.060 --> 10:48.320
that thing is blazing up
the charts like wildfire.

10:48.340 --> 10:49.940
It's <i> very</i> revealing.

10:50.940 --> 10:52.200
A lot of people

10:52.220 --> 10:54.110
love to see girl groups
rip each other apart.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.050
But there's no beef here.

10:56.180 --> 10:58.590
- Is there?
- I'm a fan.

10:58.620 --> 11:01.080
I love to hear that,
especially since word is

11:01.100 --> 11:05.660
that Star's "There For You" just
hit seven million downloads.

11:05.890 --> 11:08.360
- Congratulations, Star.
- Hmm.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.620
What's next, ladies?

11:15.680 --> 11:17.270
<i>I have to hand it to you.</i>

11:17.310 --> 11:19.770
You saved your damn job
with Star's new single.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.156
I'm taking advantage
of the momentum.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.340
I booked her a photo shoot,
and I got more coming.

11:23.380 --> 11:26.350
I knew I'd find your
slippery ass here.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.580
You bailed Noah out of jail,
and then you covered it up.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.220
I got friends at the
police station.

11:31.250 --> 11:33.620
Yeah. His face would
be all over the press,

11:33.640 --> 11:35.460
and his tour would be
over before it started.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.690
- You're enabling him.
- Didn't he fire you?

11:38.840 --> 11:41.060
You better wake the hell up
before you lose everything.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.100
You got one artist
who needs rehab,

11:43.120 --> 11:44.620
and the others are
being torn apart

11:44.660 --> 11:46.120
because of a song you released.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.670
When I heard Star's single
on air, it already had heat.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.970
I ain't release it.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.110
- Then who did?
- I did.

11:52.140 --> 11:56.140
Star had some things to get off
her chest, and we struck gold.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.700
You're just up in
everything now, huh?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.710
No, not anymore.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.680
I'm picking up your slack.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.320
I mean, you got a lot going on.
Losing Jahil, and...

12:05.360 --> 12:07.190

12:32.150 --> 12:34.280

you hit it right,

12:38.180 --> 12:40.960

- Come on, Cassie.

of you, don't I?

12:44.190 --> 12:45.880

22:06.260 --> 22:08.279
Of course for me. It ain't

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You
don't have to do that.

25:59.410 --> 26:00.739

26:24.730 --> 26:26.220
Right.

I'm not standing here
listening to this.

34:45.780 --> 34:48.620
I've been shot in my own office.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.429
I won't give my father
the satisfaction

34:51.469 --> 34:53.270
of thinking I'm weak.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.639
Stop it. You ain't weak.

34:55.670 --> 34:58.140
Girl, I'm...

34:58.180 --> 35:00.660
I'm preg... I'm pregnant.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.680
It's Jahil's.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.640
What a mess.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.420
- _ - CARLOTTA: <i>I know
it was a lot of blood,</i>

35:12.460 --> 35:15.390
but she's already discharged
and back to work.

35:16.890 --> 35:19.800
But you got to tell me why you
needed that money so bad.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.820
Jahil's bullet was meant for me.

35:32.980 --> 35:34.440
Who you owe?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.760
Who's after you? Look,

35:36.910 --> 35:40.400
I can help you, but you gonna
have to give me a name.

35:42.550 --> 35:43.900
Who killed Jahil?

35:44.980 --> 35:47.200
Look at me, answer me!

35:49.390 --> 35:50.660
Your sister.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.930
Cassie.

35:56.570 --> 35:58.240
My Cassie?

36:03.580 --> 36:05.760
You owe my sister money?!

36:07.080 --> 36:08.880
Is you crazy?

36:11.180 --> 36:13.080
Oh, my God.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.440
- Carlotta. Carlotta.
- Oh, my God.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.960
I think you're right.

36:20.990 --> 36:24.580
Ah. I see we have a
quorum in here today.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.130
You're in my seat, girl.

36:32.170 --> 36:34.200
It's not your seat anymore.

36:34.370 --> 36:37.059
I'm taking over leadership
of Floyd Entertainment.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.710
You are the one who taught
me how to play chess, Daddy.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.660
True, true. Very true.

36:41.850 --> 36:43.400
Checkmate.

36:44.780 --> 36:47.280
Get him out of here.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.160
Don't put your hands on...

36:50.420 --> 36:52.060
Get off of me, damn it!

36:52.460 --> 36:53.960
Bye.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.840
Perfect timing.

36:56.860 --> 37:00.040
Now that I'll be running
Floyd Entertainment,

37:00.120 --> 37:03.530
allow me to introduce you to
the new head of Midtown Sound:

37:03.570 --> 37:06.840
Carlotta Brown.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.680
You're fired.

37:21.290 --> 37:23.450
Slow down.

37:23.490 --> 37:24.990
Pace yourself.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.059
- My bad. I'm here. We here.
- We here?

37:27.060 --> 37:28.979
- We here.
- Yo, can y'all chill?

37:28.980 --> 37:31.390
I can hear you from
my dressing room.

37:31.430 --> 37:34.530
Noah, please don't tell me you
messing with this bitch again.

37:40.080 --> 37:43.020
Second night of a national
tour, you believe that?

37:44.740 --> 37:46.260
What's up?

37:47.440 --> 37:50.260
When I got to Atlanta, it
was just me and the girls.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.550
That's all we had
was each other.

37:53.580 --> 37:56.380
So when I pictured this,
I was here with them.

37:56.420 --> 37:59.500
Instead, I'm here with you.
Look at you.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.390
Noah, you're throwing
it all away.

38:01.430 --> 38:03.106
Man, I'm not trying to
hear your mouth right now

38:03.130 --> 38:04.130
before I go onstage!

38:04.131 --> 38:05.760
What are you trying to do?

38:05.800 --> 38:07.740
What the hell are
you doing, Noah?

38:08.260 --> 38:09.720
I'm on top, Star.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.680
That's what this looks like.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.419
That's what it is, but
you wouldn't know that

38:13.420 --> 38:14.550
'cause you ain't never
been here before.

38:14.570 --> 38:17.640
I'm right where you are! I'm
alone and you're alone!

38:18.700 --> 38:19.920
And you're crumbling.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.490
I ain't alone. You hear them cro...
You hear the crowd?

38:21.510 --> 38:23.450
And you're crumbling.

38:23.820 --> 38:26.340
It's a choice to be broken,
I'm learning that.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.660
I'm trying to change. Are
you ever gonna change?

38:31.860 --> 38:33.540
You can't, can you?

38:34.290 --> 38:36.940
'Cause you think all of
this makes you an artist.

38:37.290 --> 38:38.700
It don't.

38:41.230 --> 38:43.120
It just makes you an addict.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.080
Not Prince. Not Michael.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.340
Just an addict.
