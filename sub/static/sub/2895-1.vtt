00:00.969 --> 00:02.284
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

00:02.285 --> 00:03.981
I have a list here
of the signing bonuses

00:03.982 --> 00:07.059
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

00:07.060 --> 00:09.978
An advance plus my salary
will cover my tuition.

00:10.063 --> 00:11.313
Those numbers don't add up.

00:11.398 --> 00:13.298
Summer associates
work as lawyers,

00:13.350 --> 00:15.300
and I can do the same.

00:15.352 --> 00:18.136
It's an offer letter.
We're investment bankers.

00:18.188 --> 00:19.988
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

00:20.073 --> 00:21.523
Harvey, Stephanie Liston
just called me.

00:21.608 --> 00:23.659
She said they just brought Mike
in for questioning.

00:23.743 --> 00:26.695
You're a dirty lawyer,
and now you're on my radar.

00:26.780 --> 00:29.615
I'm tired of putting the
people I care about in jeopardy.

00:29.666 --> 00:31.617
I called Jonathan Sidwell
this afternoon.

00:31.668 --> 00:33.485
I took the job.

00:33.536 --> 00:35.838
Mike Ross never went
to law school.

00:35.922 --> 00:39.792
I knew it,
and I hired him anyway.

00:39.843 --> 00:41.677
I still can't stay, Harvey.

00:41.761 --> 00:43.462
I'm sorry.

00:43.513 --> 00:46.031
Give me permission to go.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.699 --> 01:22.301
Going to work or school?

01:22.368 --> 01:24.970
Both.

01:25.037 --> 01:27.005
Think you have time
for some of this?

01:28.258 --> 01:32.210
Maybe if you will loan me
your limo.

01:32.262 --> 01:35.063
Hmm.

01:35.148 --> 01:37.065
I'm sure
we can work something out.

01:37.150 --> 01:39.401
Mm-hmm.

02:13.052 --> 02:14.753
Thought you were
getting dressed.

02:14.804 --> 02:16.889
I did get dressed.

02:16.940 --> 02:18.557
Then you got undressed.

02:18.608 --> 02:21.693
I got a little hot.

02:21.761 --> 02:23.595
Yes.

02:23.646 --> 02:26.148
You did.

02:36.709 --> 02:39.995
Come to think of it, it is
getting a little warm in here.

03:03.970 --> 03:06.989
Good. Thank you.

03:07.073 --> 03:08.156
Mr. Gillis.

03:08.241 --> 03:09.992
Mike Ross.
Nice to meet you.

03:10.076 --> 03:11.577
You should know
I'm only doing this

03:11.644 --> 03:13.278
as a courtesy
to Jonathan Sidwell.

03:13.329 --> 03:15.981
But I'll tell you right now,
the answer is no.

03:16.032 --> 03:18.584
- Good.
- Why good?

03:18.651 --> 03:19.918
Because a yes
is always so much better

03:19.986 --> 03:20.953
when it starts as a no.

03:21.004 --> 03:22.704
You're a confident young man,

03:22.789 --> 03:25.657
but I know what my
distribution centers are worth.

03:25.708 --> 03:26.875
You know
what they're worth to you.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.662
This is what they're worth
to me.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.500
This is bigger
than I expected.

03:35.552 --> 03:37.669
I've heard that before.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.671
Okay, fun time's over.

03:39.722 --> 03:41.523
I'm not interested in selling
to someone

03:41.608 --> 03:42.858
who I don't know
where they're coming from.

03:42.942 --> 03:44.977
Let me tell you
where I'm coming from.

03:45.028 --> 03:46.678
I do my homework.

03:46.729 --> 03:49.231
These centers are a beacon
to every predator out there

03:49.315 --> 03:50.449
that you haven't laid
the groundwork

03:50.516 --> 03:51.817
to get out of the DVD business.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.508
Sounds to me
like where you're coming from

03:53.519 --> 03:54.786
is trying to scare me.

03:54.854 --> 03:56.321
No, no,
I'm not trying to scare you.

03:56.372 --> 03:59.575
I'm trying to help you.

03:59.659 --> 04:02.411
They're circling,
and you know it.

04:02.495 --> 04:03.629
You don't do this,

04:03.696 --> 04:05.297
you might as well send out
an invitation

04:05.364 --> 04:08.467
asking for a hostile takeover.

04:08.534 --> 04:10.335
This number can't be real.

04:10.386 --> 04:11.553
- It is.
- Then what the hell

04:11.638 --> 04:13.338
are you gonna do
with my distribution centers?

04:13.389 --> 04:16.541
I'll be happy to tell you that
five seconds after I buy them.

04:18.595 --> 04:20.512
Walter, I know you want
your people to be okay,

04:20.563 --> 04:22.564
and I give you my word
they will be.

04:22.649 --> 04:25.601
But these centers...
have become a headache.

04:25.685 --> 04:28.520
And you need cash for when
those predators come knocking.

04:28.571 --> 04:31.406
Let them knock.
I'm not answering the door.

04:31.491 --> 04:33.025
No, you're not hearing me.

04:33.076 --> 04:35.911
If you don't raise enough money,
they're coming in

04:35.995 --> 04:41.066
whether you answer that door
or not.

04:41.117 --> 04:44.235
The offer's good
for another hour.

04:51.628 --> 04:53.712
You are not
my hair-gelled partner in crime.

04:53.763 --> 04:56.098
I haven't used hair gel
since ninth grade.

04:56.182 --> 04:59.601
I was trying to avoid
the frizzy look.

04:59.686 --> 05:01.053
Where is he?

05:01.104 --> 05:02.354
Donna said that he had
a morning meeting

05:02.421 --> 05:03.388
outside of the office.

05:03.439 --> 05:05.057
And where is Donna?

05:05.108 --> 05:06.358
Right here.

05:06.425 --> 05:08.443
I prefer to appear
at the exact moment I'm needed.

05:08.528 --> 05:09.611
I wish I could say the same
for Harvey.

05:09.696 --> 05:11.429
- Oh, well, Harvey has a very--
- Save it.

05:11.481 --> 05:12.931
She may have been born
yesterday,

05:12.982 --> 05:15.901
but I know that morning meeting
doesn't mean "morning meeting."

05:15.952 --> 05:16.985
Everyone knows that.

05:17.070 --> 05:18.350
It's just not my place
to say it.

05:18.371 --> 05:19.287
Not mine either.

05:19.372 --> 05:21.439
He did it yesterday too.

05:21.491 --> 05:22.991
When he resurfaces,

05:23.076 --> 05:26.745
tell Specter
Pearson wants to see him.

05:29.215 --> 05:30.749
I used mousse
in high school.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.968
It was the '90s.
Was it?

05:33.052 --> 05:34.336
I heard that.

05:52.021 --> 05:53.655
Did you bring me lunch?

05:53.740 --> 05:55.157
Chen Dynasty.

05:55.241 --> 05:56.775
How many egg rolls
are in here?

05:56.826 --> 05:58.610
- Two.
- You closed Gillis.

05:58.661 --> 06:00.078
No, I killed Gillis.

06:00.146 --> 06:03.148
Well, I hope you told them
no mushrooms in the lo mein.

06:03.199 --> 06:05.751
- You never told me that.
- I didn't think I had to.

06:05.818 --> 06:07.152
Aren't you supposed to be
the one taking care of me?

06:07.203 --> 06:09.538
Ugh, how am I
supposed to do that

06:09.622 --> 06:11.423
when there are mushrooms
in my lo mein?

06:11.490 --> 06:13.258
Why do I
keep you around again?

06:13.325 --> 06:14.686
Deal memo
on Friedman Technologies,

06:14.761 --> 06:16.828
engagement letter
signed by Stillman,

06:16.879 --> 06:18.997
and, oh, two front-row tickets
to Daft Punk

06:19.048 --> 06:20.716
for you and Rachel tonight.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.136
But why do I
keep you around?

06:24.187 --> 06:26.004
Mike, Sidwell's in there
waiting for you.

06:26.055 --> 06:28.473
Be careful, okay?
He's not in a good mood.

06:28.524 --> 06:30.108
It's okay.
You know why?

06:30.176 --> 06:32.177
'Cause I killed it
with Gillis.

06:32.228 --> 06:33.445
Hey, Amy.
Yeah?

06:33.512 --> 06:34.780
Eat the mushrooms.
They're good for you.

06:34.847 --> 06:36.565
Screw you.

06:36.649 --> 06:39.401
- Morning.
- Where have you been?

06:39.485 --> 06:40.986
Oh, you know,
just getting Walter Gillis

06:41.037 --> 06:42.738
to sell us
all of his distribution centers.

06:42.822 --> 06:45.707
Oh.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.959
- What the hell are you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

06:48.027 --> 06:50.195
I'm sending a message.
We're not a convent.

06:50.246 --> 06:51.496
We're in business
to make money.

06:51.547 --> 06:53.198
And this deal does that.

06:53.249 --> 06:55.129
You did this deal
to retain those people's jobs.

06:55.134 --> 06:57.753
- And to make us 30%.
- We're a hedge fund.

06:57.837 --> 06:59.137
If we don't make 50%,

06:59.205 --> 07:01.366
we might as well buy time-shares
and hope for the best.

07:01.373 --> 07:03.041
That's bullshit.
This deal is solid.

07:03.092 --> 07:05.560
No, what's bullshit is you've
been here for three months.

07:05.645 --> 07:08.085
All you've done is hit singles,
and I need a goddamn home run.

07:08.147 --> 07:09.648
- Jonathan, listen.
- I don't want to hear it.

07:09.715 --> 07:12.017
I want you to get
your head out of your ass.

07:12.068 --> 07:13.602
Stop trying
to save people's jobs,

07:13.686 --> 07:16.688
and start making us
some real money.

07:16.739 --> 07:19.390

08:04.100 --> 08:05.850
I heard you wanted to see me.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.435
That was three hours ago.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.104
If you knew what I was doing
three hours ago,

08:09.188 --> 08:10.588
I don't think
you would've wanted to see me.

08:10.639 --> 08:12.724
I know what you were doing
three hours ago.

08:12.775 --> 08:16.227
Well, then, you should have
come on over.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.779
Maybe you should try having

08:17.863 --> 08:19.814
some morning meetings yourself.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.100
Don't you worry
about my mornings.

08:22.151 --> 08:24.619
What you need to worry about
is Logan Sanders.

08:24.703 --> 08:26.154
What?

08:26.238 --> 08:28.540
He drive one of his father's
subsidiaries into bankruptcy?

08:28.607 --> 08:31.292
The opposite.
Boy got his shit together.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.660
Max is retiring,
and Logan's taking over.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.330
Let me guess.
He wants a meeting.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.498
He's got one.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.832
With you, tomorrow morning,
10:00 a.m.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.052
Great.
Push it a week.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.254
Harvey, this kid considers
himself a young lion.

08:43.304 --> 08:44.422
He's gonna want
to make his mark,

08:44.473 --> 08:46.141
and the easiest way
for him to do that

08:46.225 --> 08:47.959
is to change lawyers.

08:48.010 --> 08:49.594
Maybe, but the last thing
a lion wants

08:49.645 --> 08:52.263
is to have his dinner handed
to him on a silver platter.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.966
You're gonna give him
a hunt.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.634
Did you think of that
all on your own?

08:56.685 --> 08:57.735
I'm extra sharp.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.521
I haven't worked
a minute all morning.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.489
See, that's funny, 'cause
I was late from all the sex.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.158
Get the hell out
of my office.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.693
♪ Bow chicka bow bow

09:14.253 --> 09:15.503
Look what the cat dragged in.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.506
And you're wearing a vest.
Here it comes.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.042
Here what comes?
Mazel tov.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.011
Congratulations
on your special day.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.762
- That's a good one.
- Harvey, leave him alone.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.181
He looks better than you do.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.349
- Thank you, Donna.
- You're welcome.

09:28.434 --> 09:29.767
Oh, and Mr. Peanut called,

09:29.835 --> 09:31.386
and he said he'd be happy
to lend you his top hat.

09:31.470 --> 09:34.005
- Are you two finished?
- I could go all day.

09:34.056 --> 09:35.356
I think the vest
has had enough.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.058
Yeah.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.860
So you come all the way
down here just to let me know

09:38.944 --> 09:40.979
that you were right
about Walter Gillis?

09:41.030 --> 09:42.591
I came all the way over here
to tell you

09:42.615 --> 09:43.948
I am done playing
in the kiddie pool.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.733
- I'm listening.
- I'm going after a whale.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.702
I think I'm in love.
Let's go to war.

09:47.786 --> 09:49.787
That's the thing.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.289
We're not going to war.

09:51.356 --> 09:54.626
Mike, the second
whoever it is finds out

09:54.693 --> 09:56.211
that you've got 5%
of their company,

09:56.295 --> 09:57.695
we're going to war
whether you like it or not.

09:57.746 --> 10:00.381
They're not gonna find
that out because I don't own 5%.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.034
Do I need to give you
a tutorial on the procedure?

10:03.085 --> 10:04.586
You start by buying shares.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.887
I know what
the procedure is, Harvey.

10:05.971 --> 10:07.255
Well, how many shares
have you bought?

10:07.339 --> 10:08.873
- None.
- This phrase,

10:08.924 --> 10:10.141
"I know what
the procedure is,"

10:10.209 --> 10:12.260
I don't think it means
what you think it means.

10:12.344 --> 10:15.063
Well, as inconceivable
as it might be to you, Harvey,

10:15.147 --> 10:16.731
I'm actually
not going in hostile.

10:16.815 --> 10:17.932
What are you talking about?

10:18.017 --> 10:19.234
I'm talking
about approaching someone

10:19.318 --> 10:21.352
to buy their company
in order to keep it alive,

10:21.403 --> 10:23.154
instead of selling it
for parts.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.862
You're offering someone
hugs and rainbows.

10:24.907 --> 10:27.442
I'm offering someone
the chance to survive

10:27.526 --> 10:29.194
and banking
that they'll take that chance

10:29.245 --> 10:31.279
rather than give up.

10:31.363 --> 10:32.747
You don't have the money,
do you?

10:32.831 --> 10:33.915
No, I don't.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.950
But even if I did,
I wouldn't use it.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.503
Well,
welcome to what every person

10:38.570 --> 10:39.904
who doesn't have money
has ever said.

10:39.955 --> 10:41.956
Oh, I get it.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.292
You think this is the meeting
where you make fun of my idea.

10:44.376 --> 10:45.460
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.911
This is the meeting
where you realize

10:46.962 --> 10:50.798
that my idea is happening
whether you like it or not.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.383
Where's the fun
in that meeting?

10:52.434 --> 10:53.768
Oh, the fun?

10:53.852 --> 10:56.754
It's all right over here
on this side of the table.

10:56.805 --> 10:58.565
Hey, I'll give you a chance
to get acquainted

10:58.590 --> 10:59.941
with the new reality.

11:00.025 --> 11:01.192
I'll be in my office.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.894
Get back to me
by the end of the day.

11:02.945 --> 11:04.095
Wow.

11:04.146 --> 11:07.732
Looks like our baby boy's
all growns up.

11:07.783 --> 11:10.118
Hey, tell me, sweetheart,
you guys validate parking?

11:10.202 --> 11:11.119
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.604
I've got it right here.

11:13.656 --> 11:15.173
And how many hours
is that good for?

11:15.241 --> 11:16.491
What's it matter?

11:16.575 --> 11:18.376
We're just gonna charge it
back to you anyway.

11:21.046 --> 11:23.114
You know my secretary is,
like, so much younger

11:24.917 --> 11:26.450
did he say "fitter"?

11:28.387 --> 11:30.288
What did you find out?

11:30.339 --> 11:32.423
- Woodall's resurfacing.
- Me too. When?

11:32.474 --> 11:33.925
- Next week.
- Me too. Where?

11:33.976 --> 11:35.793
- S.E.C.
- Me too. Title?

11:35.844 --> 11:37.762
- Supervisor.
- Director.

11:37.813 --> 11:39.013
Me too.
I just threw that in

11:39.098 --> 11:40.815
to make sure
you weren't yes-man-ing me.

11:40.899 --> 11:41.933
Talk to me.

11:41.984 --> 11:42.850
I found out
the name of the man

11:42.935 --> 11:44.018
Woodall's sending after us.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.437
Jeff Malone.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.440
Jeff Malone is a beast.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.525
Well, the only way

11:50.609 --> 11:53.811
to beat a beast
is with a bigger beast.

11:53.862 --> 11:55.163
I need to get in there
before everyone else

11:55.247 --> 11:57.915
and let Harvey and Jessica know
that I had the foresight

11:57.983 --> 11:59.450
to look for it,
the cunning to find it,

11:59.501 --> 12:00.651
and the balls to stop it.

12:00.703 --> 12:02.170
Then you take on Malone.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.988
Next stop: Name partner.

12:04.039 --> 12:06.674
- Pearson Specter Litt.
- Okay, you know what?

12:06.759 --> 12:10.461
Just let's not count
our chickens before they hatch.

12:10.512 --> 12:11.679
But just for shits and giggles,
say it one more time.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.214
Leave out Specter.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.351
Donna, I got Paul Porter's
annual restructuring proposal.

12:16.435 --> 12:19.354
Can you file it
under "I don't give a shit"?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.172
What about Mike?
You want me to have Rachel

12:21.223 --> 12:22.640
prepare a dog and pony show
for him?

12:22.691 --> 12:24.642
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

12:24.693 --> 12:26.861
Harvey, I need to talk
to you right now

12:26.945 --> 12:28.012
about something very important.

12:28.063 --> 12:29.480
Harvey, why won't it
be necessary?

12:29.531 --> 12:31.065
'Cause you don't beg
the girl to go out with you.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.233
You wait.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.068
She'll call.
That's not even-

12:34.153 --> 12:37.372
Excuse me. Hold on a second.
Um, what if they don't call?

12:37.456 --> 12:38.823
They always call.

12:38.874 --> 12:40.325
Well, what about people
who aren't you?

12:40.376 --> 12:42.493
- You mean you?
- Yeah, of course I do.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.379
If they don't call,
then they don't call.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.164
But once they smell
your desperation,

12:46.215 --> 12:47.531
they won't respect you,

12:47.583 --> 12:49.367
and you'll never get
what you want anyway.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.302
I'm sorry, did you want
to talk to me about something?

12:51.370 --> 12:53.054
It can wait.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.872
Come to think of it,

12:54.923 --> 12:56.724
tell Rachel
when she's back from school

12:56.809 --> 13:00.678
she can have
the rest of the day off.

13:02.898 --> 13:05.049
Harvey.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.102
You do that, you might as well
send Mike a telegram that says,

13:08.187 --> 13:10.154
"I'm not putting any thought
into your idea."

13:10.222 --> 13:11.906
Yeah, might as well.

13:11.990 --> 13:14.275
Okay, are you sure that's how
you want to play this?

13:14.360 --> 13:15.777
Didn't I just answer that?

13:15.861 --> 13:19.614
You did, but this isn't about
whether or not Mike calls back.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.565
This is about you
not letting Mike call the shots.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.117
I let him call the shots,
all he's gonna do

13:23.202 --> 13:24.869
is shoot himself in the foot.
Maybe.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.671
But if this was anybody
other than Mike,

13:26.738 --> 13:28.256
you wouldn't be acting
like this.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.507
Bullshit. I don't let
Tony Gianopolous push me around.

13:29.574 --> 13:30.908
You think I'm gonna let
Mike Ross?

13:30.976 --> 13:33.127
No, of course you don't let
Tony push you around,

13:33.212 --> 13:35.763
but I've never seen you
mock one of his ideas.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.215
Yeah, because his ideas
aren't ridiculous.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.583
This is
Mike's first big idea.

13:39.635 --> 13:42.086
And I just told you,
his first big idea sucks.

13:42.137 --> 13:44.605
And if you use Rachel
to deliver that message,

13:44.690 --> 13:45.650
this is gonna end badly.

13:45.691 --> 13:46.891
Okay, thanks, mom, but I think

13:46.925 --> 13:48.192
I'm gonna keep playing ball
in the house.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.862
Okay, act like a child
who doesn't want to be told

13:50.929 --> 13:52.169
what to do,
but Mike's a client,

13:52.197 --> 13:53.597
and you need to start
treating him like one.

13:53.649 --> 13:55.616
Donna, the next time
I need help figuring out

13:55.701 --> 13:58.436
how to treat a client,
I'll let you know.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.571
Okay, great.

14:11.421 --> 14:13.322
Harvey, what can I do
for you?

14:13.373 --> 14:15.324
There's a Jeff Malone
waiting in the conference room

14:15.375 --> 14:16.492
wanting to see both of us.

14:16.543 --> 14:18.494
Any idea who he is?

14:18.545 --> 14:21.430
I've run into him before.
He's a hotshot at the S.E.C.

14:21.498 --> 14:24.833
- What do you think he wants?
- Let's go find out.

14:27.670 --> 14:29.138
Ms. Pearson.

14:29.189 --> 14:30.523
You must be
Harvey Specter.

14:30.607 --> 14:32.508
I'm Jeff Malone.
I know who you are.

14:32.559 --> 14:33.976
My question is,
why are you here?

14:34.027 --> 14:36.812
- You seem hostile.
- You investigate

14:36.863 --> 14:39.565
publicly traded companies.
We're not publicly traded.

14:39.649 --> 14:41.200
No, but your clients are.

14:41.284 --> 14:43.235
Hence his question
and our hostility.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.187
- Our?
- We tend to stick together

14:45.238 --> 14:47.490
when an uninvited guest
interrupts our dinner.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.875
Well, I didn't bring any wine,
but when I go,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.360
I hope you'll be happy
that I dropped by.

14:51.411 --> 14:53.329
Yeah, I doubt that.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.798
So why don't you tell us
which client you're here for

14:55.865 --> 14:57.366
and be on your way?

14:57.417 --> 14:59.919
All of them.

15:00.003 --> 15:03.372
Since when does the S.E.C.
go around intimidating law firms

15:03.423 --> 15:05.040
by going after their clients?

15:05.092 --> 15:06.392
They don't, but they will

15:06.476 --> 15:08.677
when Eric Woodall starts there
next week.

15:08.728 --> 15:10.846
He comes at our clients
after what he did,

15:10.897 --> 15:14.350
this time, he won't get fired,
he'll end up in jail.

15:14.401 --> 15:16.569
Except it won't be Woodall
who's coming.

15:16.653 --> 15:17.886
It'll be him.

15:17.938 --> 15:20.055
Exactly.

15:20.107 --> 15:22.775
Listen, I'm gonna be getting
a vaguely worded assignment

15:22.859 --> 15:24.026
with a not-so-vague agenda

15:24.077 --> 15:25.411
of getting up
your clients' asses

15:25.495 --> 15:27.496
with the full power
of the S.E.C.

15:27.564 --> 15:28.697
And when they ask why--

15:28.748 --> 15:30.699
and they always ask why--

15:30.750 --> 15:32.118
I'm gonna be expected
to tell them

15:32.202 --> 15:33.752
that it's because
they're clients of your firm.

15:33.837 --> 15:35.070
Why are you telling us this?

15:35.122 --> 15:37.623
Because he doesn't want
to work for Woodall.

15:37.707 --> 15:40.376
He wants to work here.

15:40.427 --> 15:43.879
I've always heard
how good you were.

15:43.930 --> 15:46.465
It's nice to see it's true.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.684
Anyway, here's the thing.

15:48.751 --> 15:51.720
I'm really tired
of being a public servant,

15:51.771 --> 15:53.522
and more importantly,
I've always thought

15:53.590 --> 15:55.858
that Eric Woodall
was a, um--

15:55.925 --> 15:57.610
oh, shit,
I'll just go ahead and say it.

15:57.694 --> 15:58.694
He's a dick.

15:58.761 --> 16:00.929
Finally, something
we can agree on.

16:00.981 --> 16:02.931
Seems to me the only thing
left for us to agree on, Harvey,

16:02.983 --> 16:04.116
is my starting salary.

16:04.201 --> 16:06.435
I'm just kidding.

16:06.486 --> 16:08.654
I'm sure
all your new senior partners

16:08.738 --> 16:10.439
get paid the same.

16:10.490 --> 16:11.657
Before you start picking out
floor patterns

16:11.741 --> 16:12.958
for your new office,

16:13.043 --> 16:15.327
I'd like to discuss this
with my partner first.

16:15.412 --> 16:18.113
I'd expect nothing less.

16:18.165 --> 16:20.616
Oh, uh, just one more thing.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.551
I haven't been formally given
this assignment yet,

16:22.619 --> 16:23.836
so I have no conflict.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.171
But in one more week I will,

16:25.255 --> 16:26.505
which means this offer
will be gone.

16:26.590 --> 16:27.673
Is that a threat?

16:27.757 --> 16:28.957
I would never threaten someone

16:29.009 --> 16:31.060
that I want to be
in business with, Jessica.

16:31.127 --> 16:34.063
It's just the truth.

16:37.567 --> 16:38.934
I like him.

16:41.971 --> 16:43.972
How did it go with Harvey?

16:44.024 --> 16:47.359
Didn't.

16:47.444 --> 16:49.478
What do you mean
"it didn't"?

16:49.529 --> 16:52.414
You're the only man here
who can take on Jeff Malone.

16:52.482 --> 16:55.084
How could he not see that?
I didn't bring it up.

16:55.151 --> 16:57.703
Louis, winter is coming.

16:57.787 --> 16:59.288
I know,
and I'm the night's watch.

16:59.339 --> 17:02.208
But right now
we need to be patient.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.678
Patience
is not your strong suit.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.128
Well, today it is.

17:07.180 --> 17:08.664
Because if there's one thing
that I've always known,

17:08.714 --> 17:10.883
it's that you do not call
the pretty girl.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.550
You wait for her to call you.

17:12.636 --> 17:14.836
Louis, I'm seeing someone.

17:14.887 --> 17:16.305
I'm happy for you,

17:16.356 --> 17:17.556
though I have no idea why
you're saying that right now.

17:17.641 --> 17:19.007
Katrina, trust me.

17:19.059 --> 17:21.175
They're gonna find out
about Jeff Malone soon enough

17:21.228 --> 17:22.528
'cause he's gonna come calling.

17:22.612 --> 17:25.481
And when he does, they're gonna
come right over to me.

17:25.531 --> 17:27.650
Like him all you want.
I'm not hiring him.

17:27.701 --> 17:29.201
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

17:29.286 --> 17:30.619
Because you don't like
making decisions

17:30.687 --> 17:32.321
staring down the barrel
of a shotgun.

17:32.372 --> 17:33.906
Jessica Pearson.
Nice to meet you.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.791
Jessica,
the man walked in here

17:35.858 --> 17:37.326
and offered to fight for us.

17:37.377 --> 17:38.877
If it's not him,
who's it gonna be?

17:38.962 --> 17:41.714
The guy in the office
next door.

17:41.798 --> 17:43.082
Louis?

17:43.166 --> 17:45.217
Harvey, Louis knows
everything there is to know

17:45.302 --> 17:46.218
about the S.E.C.

17:46.303 --> 17:48.053
He's damn good,
and you know it.

17:48.138 --> 17:50.172
This guy isn't damn good.
He's a killer.

17:50.223 --> 17:52.508
And he's a prosecutor.
We need a defender.

17:52.559 --> 17:53.892
If I'm in a dark alley,

17:53.977 --> 17:55.561
I'd take the killer
over the defender

17:55.645 --> 17:56.762
seven days a week.

17:56.846 --> 17:59.715
And Eric Woodall's gonna put us
in a dark alley.

17:59.766 --> 18:01.100
Louis is a known quantity.

18:01.184 --> 18:03.218
And right now Jeff Malone's
biggest selling point

18:03.270 --> 18:04.937
is telling us
that Woodall is coming.

18:05.021 --> 18:06.238
Louis sure as hell didn't,

18:06.323 --> 18:08.056
which means
he either didn't know

18:08.108 --> 18:09.558
or he wasn't man enough
to come in here

18:09.609 --> 18:11.694
and take the job for himself.

18:11.745 --> 18:14.863
Harvey, do you know why
I don't like being strong-armed

18:14.914 --> 18:16.282
into decisions?

18:16.366 --> 18:19.418
Because I'll never be able
to trust the person who did it.

18:19.502 --> 18:21.704
Then figure out a way
to get someone as good

18:21.755 --> 18:24.540
or hire this guy
and come to terms with it.

18:24.591 --> 18:25.874
Because if it's Louis
against Malone

18:25.925 --> 18:28.877
in a street fight,
I'm picking that dude.

18:36.853 --> 18:39.021
Oh, thank you.

18:39.088 --> 18:40.128
Hey, how'd your meeting go

18:40.140 --> 18:41.307
with the mysterious
Harvey Specter?

18:41.391 --> 18:43.592
Being a dick
doesn't make him mysterious.

18:43.643 --> 18:45.594
Well, then I guess
you're an open book.

18:45.645 --> 18:47.806
You know, I was gonna give you
those Daft Punk tickets,

18:47.814 --> 18:50.282
but now after that,
I think I'll give them to Edna.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.601
Okay, first of all, Edna
was 63 when Daft Punk was born.

18:52.652 --> 18:54.453
Really?
With that skin?

18:54.537 --> 18:55.537
You know what, I worked hard
to get you those things.

18:55.605 --> 18:56.605
Why aren't you going?

18:56.656 --> 18:57.939
I dropped the hammer
on Harvey,

18:57.991 --> 19:00.042
which means Rachel's
gonna be working all night.

19:00.109 --> 19:02.277
Hey, what are you doing here?

19:02.329 --> 19:04.279
Donna texted me
when I was at Columbia...

19:04.331 --> 19:05.381
Mmhmm.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.049
And told me
that Harvey gave me

19:07.116 --> 19:09.551
the rest of the day off
because I'm kicking ass.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.503
He's giving you
the rest of the day off?

19:11.588 --> 19:12.888
Mmhmm, so I figured

19:12.955 --> 19:16.958
we could celebrate over dinner
before the concert.

19:17.010 --> 19:19.171
What, are you jealous 'cause
he never did that for you?

19:19.229 --> 19:21.630
Um, no.
That's great.

19:21.681 --> 19:23.766
You pick a place.
I'll meet you there.

19:23.817 --> 19:26.185
I got to set up some meetings
for tomorrow first.

19:26.269 --> 19:27.309
What about the little owl?

19:27.354 --> 19:30.305
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:39.532 --> 19:42.034
Mike, what are you doing here?

19:42.118 --> 19:45.788
You delivered a message,
so now I'm delivering one.

19:47.924 --> 19:50.709
Pearson Specter
is formally in review.

19:50.794 --> 19:52.511
What did you just say to me?

19:52.595 --> 19:55.214
You want my business,
you're gonna have to earn it.

19:55.298 --> 19:57.466
- I have earned it.
- By shit-ing on my plan?

19:57.517 --> 19:58.851
You don't have a plan.

19:58.935 --> 20:00.168
You're running into a wall.

20:00.220 --> 20:01.303
It's not my job
to crash into it with you.

20:01.354 --> 20:02.638
Crash into it?

20:02.689 --> 20:04.172
You didn't even ask me
who I'm going after.

20:04.224 --> 20:06.275
I didn't have to
because it doesn't matter.

20:06.342 --> 20:08.022
But go ahead. Who is it?
Gillis industries.

20:08.027 --> 20:10.028
That's not a whale.
That's a monster.

20:10.113 --> 20:13.482
A man like Walter Gillis isn't
gonna listen to a guy like you

20:13.533 --> 20:15.734
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

20:15.819 --> 20:18.120
That's exactly
what you said to me

20:18.187 --> 20:20.072
before I got him to sell me
his distribution centers.

20:20.156 --> 20:21.690
Congratulations.
You got to walk his dog.

20:21.741 --> 20:24.192
That doesn't mean he's gonna
let you marry his daughter.

20:24.244 --> 20:26.795
Listen to me.
You want to be my guy?

20:26.863 --> 20:28.424
You stop telling me
why I can't do this,

20:28.465 --> 20:30.582
and you start figuring out
how I can.

20:30.667 --> 20:31.884
I already told you
how you can.

20:31.968 --> 20:33.728
You get some money,
start buying some shares,

20:33.803 --> 20:35.587
and you walk in there
with a club

20:35.672 --> 20:36.889
and the balls to use it
if you have to.

20:36.973 --> 20:38.891
Harvey, when I told you
my plan's happening

20:38.975 --> 20:40.509
whether you like it or not,
I meant it.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.144
I'm interviewing law firms
tomorrow.

20:42.211 --> 20:44.263
You show up with a better
attitude and another move,

20:44.347 --> 20:47.215
or you just lost a client.

20:51.964 --> 20:53.519
You want talk about it?

20:54.808 --> 20:56.559
Talk about what?

20:56.610 --> 21:00.646
About whatever's going on
with you and Harvey.

21:03.116 --> 21:04.951
Why does everybody think
that I was born yesterday?

21:05.035 --> 21:07.102
I tell you that he gives me
the rest of the day off work,

21:07.154 --> 21:09.154
you vanish until dinner,
and then you're pissed off

21:09.156 --> 21:10.373
for the rest of the night,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.325
so it doesn't take
a rocket scientist.

21:12.409 --> 21:14.126
Clearly.

21:14.211 --> 21:16.629
I meant "I love you."

21:16.713 --> 21:18.497
Mmhmm, nice recovery.

21:18.582 --> 21:20.282
Doesn't get you
out of answering my question.

21:20.334 --> 21:21.294
You really want to know?

21:21.351 --> 21:23.118
I'll tell you.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.805
Harvey was Michael Jordan.

21:25.889 --> 21:29.592
Now it's Lebron's time,
and he can't take it.

21:29.643 --> 21:32.294
That's a pretty big accusation
to make.

21:32.346 --> 21:34.680
Well, there's more
to the story than you know.

21:34.765 --> 21:36.265
- What?
- Right, so come on.

21:36.316 --> 21:38.634
I said I didn't want to get
between you two.

21:38.685 --> 21:40.069
What?

21:42.773 --> 21:45.157
Let's just say
that you kicking ass for him

21:45.242 --> 21:48.327
isn't the reason
you got the day off.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.201
I thought
you had law school today.

21:55.285 --> 21:58.204
I do right after this.

21:58.288 --> 22:00.289
He told you.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.991
Did you think he wouldn't?

22:02.042 --> 22:03.793
Look, if you want to send
a message to Mike,

22:03.844 --> 22:04.994
go right ahead.

22:05.045 --> 22:06.429
If you want me to send
a message to Mike,

22:06.496 --> 22:09.015
tell me when and where, but...

22:09.099 --> 22:12.601
Please don't ever use me
like that again.

22:12.669 --> 22:15.504
You're right.

22:15.555 --> 22:17.974
I'm what now?

22:18.025 --> 22:19.859
I shouldn't have done that.
I'm sorry.

22:19.943 --> 22:21.560
Is it April fools' day?

22:21.645 --> 22:23.195
No, but don't ever
let it be said

22:23.280 --> 22:24.363
that I can't admit
when I'm wrong.

22:24.448 --> 22:25.982
Then I will stop
saying that.

22:26.033 --> 22:27.566
Didn't you say
you have class today?

22:27.651 --> 22:30.119
I'm on my way.

22:30.186 --> 22:31.871
What was that all about?

22:31.955 --> 22:32.955
Just some
administrative stuff.

22:33.023 --> 22:35.825
Administrative stuff.
You and Rachel.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.326
I don't want to talk
about it.

22:37.377 --> 22:38.711
You mean about how everything
I said would happen happened,

22:38.795 --> 22:40.863
and now you realize I was right
the whole time?

22:40.914 --> 22:42.081
No one likes
a gloater, Donna.

22:42.165 --> 22:43.332
Well, then I guess

22:43.383 --> 22:44.533
the Harvey Specter University
of gloating

22:44.584 --> 22:45.835
is gonna have to shut down.

22:45.886 --> 22:49.839
I can still give lectures
on the weekend.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.223
You want to hear it?

22:51.308 --> 22:53.259
You were right.

22:54.511 --> 22:55.678
Call Ray.

22:55.729 --> 22:58.047
I'm gonna go let Mike know
I'm his lawyer.

22:58.098 --> 23:01.650
You're gonna push
a meeting with me?

23:01.718 --> 23:04.854
Harvey, Logan Sanders
is here to see you.

23:04.905 --> 23:07.073
First of all,
I don't appreciate

23:07.157 --> 23:08.917
you stomping into my office
with an attitude.

23:08.992 --> 23:10.693
Yeah, well, I don't appreciate
being put off,

23:10.744 --> 23:12.078
especially when I know
that you never pushed a meeting

23:12.162 --> 23:13.412
with my father.

23:13.497 --> 23:14.897
Your father
never went to Jessica

23:14.948 --> 23:16.449
to set a meeting with me.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.918
Then I assume that next time
I call you directly,

23:19.002 --> 23:20.286
you'll pick up the phone.

23:20.370 --> 23:24.457
Logan, let me give you
the ABCs of me.

23:24.541 --> 23:27.093
I don't take meetings.
I set them.

23:27.177 --> 23:29.745
And my respect isn't demanded.
It's earned.

23:29.796 --> 23:32.598
That's only two things.
What's "C"?

23:32.682 --> 23:35.084
"C" is for people who show me
they know "A" and "B."

23:35.135 --> 23:37.970
Well, since we're quoting
<i>Jerry Maguire,</i>

23:38.055 --> 23:39.939
all I want is for you
to show me the money.

23:40.023 --> 23:43.275
You just took step number one
towards earning my respect.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.227
And I dig that about you.
Great.

23:45.278 --> 23:48.097
Would it be too much trouble for
me to discuss my business now?

23:48.148 --> 23:50.699
Well, I was gonna move on
to <i>Crimson Tide,</i>

23:50.767 --> 23:52.068
but, yeah, go ahead.

23:52.119 --> 23:53.702
Knock yourself out.

23:53.770 --> 23:55.621
You ever hear of a family
called the Winwards?

23:55.705 --> 23:58.124
No. Should I?

23:58.208 --> 23:59.441
In 1950, they were worth
the equivalent

23:59.493 --> 24:01.660
of a billion dollars.

24:01.745 --> 24:04.780
By 1988, one of them owned
a couple of dry cleaners.

24:04.831 --> 24:06.215
And it didn't happen
because they squandered it.

24:06.282 --> 24:08.501
It happened
because they stayed a dinosaur.

24:08.585 --> 24:09.985
You don't want to become
a dinosaur.

24:10.003 --> 24:11.137
No.

24:11.221 --> 24:14.640
I like to think of myself
as a shark.

24:14.724 --> 24:16.475
Keep moving forward or die.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.144
You're talking
hostile takeover.

24:18.228 --> 24:20.396
You think I'd be here
if I wasn't?

24:20.463 --> 24:22.515
You just took step number two
towards earning my respect.

24:22.599 --> 24:23.732
What's the company?

24:23.800 --> 24:26.936
Gillis Industries,
and I already own 4.9%.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.438
Logan, we have to end
this conversation right now.

24:29.489 --> 24:30.570
What are you talking about?

24:30.607 --> 24:32.074
I thought I just earned
your respect.

24:32.142 --> 24:33.275
You did,
but we have a conflict.

24:33.326 --> 24:34.660
What do you mean,
you have a conflict?

24:34.744 --> 24:35.995
I mean we have a conflict.

24:36.079 --> 24:37.997
What are you gonna do
about it?

24:38.081 --> 24:40.149
I'm gonna go
and resolve it.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.369
Well, you better do it fast,
because I am in on this.

24:43.453 --> 24:45.621
And that means you're either
with me or against me.

24:45.672 --> 24:49.158
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

24:59.386 --> 25:01.336
Hey. Prunie?

25:01.388 --> 25:03.722
- What is that?
- It's a prune smoothie.

25:03.807 --> 25:05.224
I invented it myself.

25:05.308 --> 25:06.475
Rain check.

25:06.526 --> 25:10.863
Louis, guess who
stopped by yesterday

25:10.947 --> 25:12.867
for an impromptu meeting
with Jessica and Harvey.

25:12.949 --> 25:14.700
Please tell me
it was Dick Cheney.

25:14.784 --> 25:16.685
Why would you want it
to be Dick Cheney?

25:16.736 --> 25:19.021
Why wouldn't I want it
to be Iron Dick?

25:19.072 --> 25:20.539
Holy shit, I think I know
who you were talking about.

25:20.624 --> 25:22.458
I think you do too.

25:22.525 --> 25:23.826
Is it a certain S.E.C. beast

25:23.877 --> 25:26.495
whose name happens to rhyme
with schmeff schmalone?

25:26.546 --> 25:28.914
Schmess it is,
and schmess it does.

25:28.999 --> 25:30.416
Well, schmuck me.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.218
Louis, we have a problem.

25:32.302 --> 25:34.369
What's the problem?
As if I didn't know.

25:37.924 --> 25:41.710
I just got out of a meeting
with Logan Sanders.

25:41.761 --> 25:43.846
Logan Sanders?

25:43.897 --> 25:46.232
This isn't about--
about what?

25:46.316 --> 25:48.317
Then-never mind.

25:48.384 --> 25:49.735
What's the problem?

25:49.819 --> 25:50.736
He wants to go
after the same company

25:50.820 --> 25:52.104
that Mike pitched me first.

25:52.189 --> 25:53.606
So what's the problem?
Mike brought it to you first.

25:53.690 --> 25:54.940
You're obligated
to stick with him.

25:55.025 --> 25:57.943
The problem is Mike formally
put us in review.

25:58.028 --> 26:00.729
Holy shit.
That's why you're coming to me.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.281
You're gonna lose Mike,

26:02.365 --> 26:03.866
and you want to know
if there's any way around it?

26:03.917 --> 26:06.335
- Is there?
- No, Harvey.

26:06.402 --> 26:09.338
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to drop Mike.

26:21.502 --> 26:23.103
- What happened with Harvey?
- Nothing.

26:23.121 --> 26:25.655
He had an emergency with Mike.

26:25.707 --> 26:29.492
Fine, but don't you think now
is the time to act for yourself?

26:29.544 --> 26:31.504
No, we have a good plan,
and we're sticking to it.

26:31.529 --> 26:34.181
They're stewing on Malone,
and the more they stew--

26:34.265 --> 26:36.933
The more leverage we have.

26:37.001 --> 26:38.268
Name partner.

26:38.336 --> 26:41.388
And as I've said,
all we need to do is be patient.

26:41.472 --> 26:45.508
Well, patience may be
one of your virtues,

26:45.560 --> 26:47.561
but it is not one of mine.

26:53.201 --> 26:54.451
I didn't want to jinx it.

26:54.518 --> 26:56.987
You didn't.

27:04.462 --> 27:06.546
Katrina, this is
one of the sweetest things

27:06.631 --> 27:07.914
anyone's ever done for me.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.966
I want to make sure
you don't waste your opportunity

27:10.034 --> 27:12.886
to get this.

27:12.970 --> 27:15.972
I promise I won't.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.933
What are you doing here?

27:27.018 --> 27:28.652
We shouldn't be seen together.

27:28.719 --> 27:30.053
You had no problem walking
into my place of business.

27:30.104 --> 27:31.945
Why should I have a problem
walking into yours?

27:31.989 --> 27:34.324
Because unless you're here
to tell me that I have the job,

27:34.392 --> 27:36.777
then you're putting
my position here in jeopardy.

27:36.861 --> 27:38.061
How do you think I felt

27:38.112 --> 27:39.496
when I found the man
that I'm sleeping with

27:39.563 --> 27:42.199
standing in my conference room?

27:42.250 --> 27:43.667
Jessica, will you please
lower your voice?

27:43.734 --> 27:44.668
Not only that,
but you stood there

27:44.735 --> 27:46.253
with a shit-eating grin
on your face

27:46.337 --> 27:48.672
and tried to strong-arm me
into giving you a job.

27:48.739 --> 27:51.708
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

27:51.759 --> 27:54.461
You're not funny.

27:54.545 --> 27:56.546
Why didn't you come to me first
with this?

27:56.597 --> 27:58.682
Because if I had come to you
with this first,

27:58.749 --> 28:01.134
you would have thought I was
trading on our relationship.

28:01.219 --> 28:02.752
- Aren't you?
- No.

28:02.804 --> 28:03.937
And if we weren't together,

28:04.021 --> 28:05.422
I would have gone
to both of you, all right?

28:05.473 --> 28:06.923
So I went to both of you.

28:06.974 --> 28:09.693
Now it may not
have been perfect, but...

28:09.760 --> 28:11.445
There was no perfect way
of doing it,

28:11.529 --> 28:12.595
unless I hadn't done it.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.264
Now that sounds
pretty perfect to me.

28:14.315 --> 28:15.265
What are you so afraid of?

28:15.316 --> 28:16.566
Do I have to draw you
a picture?

28:16.617 --> 28:17.767
I'm not the one
that made up the saying

28:17.819 --> 28:19.236
"you don't shit
where you eat."

28:19.287 --> 28:21.788
Am I the shit or the food in
this little painting of yours?

28:21.873 --> 28:23.206
Because if we're just a fling,

28:23.274 --> 28:24.291
then what difference
does it make

28:24.375 --> 28:25.992
whether I work with you
or not?

28:26.077 --> 28:27.911
I didn't say
we're just a fling.

28:27.962 --> 28:29.779
Then if there really
is a chance for us,

28:29.831 --> 28:31.114
then why not go for both?

28:31.165 --> 28:34.217
Because I've seen what happens
when things go south

28:34.285 --> 28:35.669
between partners,

28:35.753 --> 28:37.637
and I'm not willing to put
my business in jeopardy.

28:37.722 --> 28:38.889
Your business.

28:38.956 --> 28:42.142
Yes, my business.

28:42.226 --> 28:45.095
The one that I have fought
tooth and nail to keep together,

28:45.146 --> 28:48.298
the same business that
you strolled into with a shotgun

28:48.349 --> 28:53.069
and said, "marry me,
or I'll start shooting."

28:53.137 --> 28:55.188
Jess, if you want me
to apologize

28:55.273 --> 28:56.973
for the way that I asked,
then I will.

28:57.024 --> 28:59.693
But I don't ask for things
that I don't want.

28:59.777 --> 29:02.312
And what I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

29:02.363 --> 29:05.081
and to keep seeing you.

29:05.149 --> 29:09.202
Those two things
are not both gonna happen.

29:09.287 --> 29:11.121
Then I guess
you have to decide

29:11.172 --> 29:12.822
what's more important to you--

29:12.874 --> 29:17.043
what we have
or what you have.

29:23.518 --> 29:24.935
Hey, Mike.

29:25.002 --> 29:26.186
There's another prospect here
to see you,

29:26.270 --> 29:27.854
but he's late,
and his tie's too fat.

29:27.939 --> 29:29.005
Should I let him in?

29:29.056 --> 29:30.607
You tell her to say
all that garbage?

29:30.674 --> 29:32.275
He didn't need to,
Johnnie fat tie.

29:32.343 --> 29:34.194
Yeah, I guess I have time
for one more meeting.

29:34.278 --> 29:35.896
- Mike, I need to talk to you.
- Although, I'm sorry, sir.

29:35.980 --> 29:38.148
You've missed the pastries.
I can call you some up.

29:38.199 --> 29:39.649
Listen to me.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.351
I came down here
because I wanted to tell you

29:41.402 --> 29:43.236
if you want to run
through this wall,

29:43.321 --> 29:44.237
I'm ready to run through it
with you.

29:44.322 --> 29:45.238
Good.

29:45.323 --> 29:47.908
But I can't.

29:47.992 --> 29:48.909
What?

29:48.993 --> 29:50.160
What I can do is tell you

29:50.211 --> 29:51.495
I'm ready
to run through another one.

29:51.546 --> 29:52.946
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:52.997 --> 29:55.248
- We have a conflict.
- Bullshit.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.534
Who is it?
It's not bullshit.

29:57.585 --> 29:58.585
Then who is it?

29:58.669 --> 29:59.920
You know
I can't tell you that.

30:00.004 --> 30:00.971
No, what I know
is that it's very convenient

30:01.038 --> 30:02.389
that you suddenly
have a conflict

30:02.473 --> 30:04.874
the day after you tell me
that my idea isn't good enough.

30:04.926 --> 30:06.247
I don't find it convenient
at all,

30:06.310 --> 30:07.394
but you put us in review,

30:07.478 --> 30:09.262
and now I have to go
with the other client.

30:09.347 --> 30:11.314
I put you in review because
you refused to get on board.

30:11.382 --> 30:12.516
And I just told you,

30:12.567 --> 30:13.984
I want to run
through another wall with you,

30:14.051 --> 30:16.886
and we still can
if you drop this.

30:16.938 --> 30:19.155
And why should I be the one
to drop it?

30:19.223 --> 30:22.108
Because they're not going to,
and I have to stick with them.

30:22.193 --> 30:23.743
And I'm telling you,
you're gonna lose.

30:23.828 --> 30:24.861
What, because
you're on the other side?

30:24.912 --> 30:26.162
Because their plan
is better.

30:26.230 --> 30:27.531
Says
the professional bullshit-er

30:27.582 --> 30:30.166
who has a brand-new vested
interest in me bowing out.

30:30.234 --> 30:32.002
I'm gonna let that go.

30:32.069 --> 30:33.453
But if you don't let this go,

30:33.538 --> 30:38.592
I can't represent you
on anything until it's over.

30:38.676 --> 30:42.879
Then I guess
we're done here.

30:59.597 --> 31:01.948
You cook?

31:02.033 --> 31:04.117
You come home to this
in your kitchen,

31:04.201 --> 31:06.319
and that's what you're going
to ask me?

31:06.404 --> 31:07.487
Well, I was gonna ask you

31:07.572 --> 31:08.822
how the hell you got
into my apartment,

31:08.906 --> 31:11.941
but I knew
you weren't gonna tell me.

31:11.993 --> 31:13.243
Do you remember
when you told me

31:13.294 --> 31:16.329
I should think about taking
some morning meetings?

31:19.050 --> 31:21.251
I can't say that
it's never crossed my mind,

31:21.302 --> 31:22.636
but you really think
it's a good idea--

31:22.720 --> 31:23.753
Jeff Malone.

31:23.804 --> 31:26.723
Well, he's not my type.

31:26.790 --> 31:27.807
You gotta be kidding me.

31:27.892 --> 31:29.059
Why didn't you tell me
yesterday?

31:29.126 --> 31:30.644
Because I wasn't gonna
hire him yesterday,

31:30.728 --> 31:32.479
so it was
none of your business.

31:32.563 --> 31:35.565
But today I might,
so now it is.

31:35.633 --> 31:37.767
And you want to know
how I feel about it.

31:37.818 --> 31:39.135
You're my partner.

31:39.186 --> 31:41.354
Well, I already told you
how I feel about hiring him.

31:41.439 --> 31:42.439
This doesn't change that.

31:42.490 --> 31:45.609
Good to know.

31:45.660 --> 31:50.146
Seems like something else
is on your mind.

31:50.197 --> 31:52.699
He doesn't
just want to work together.

31:52.783 --> 31:54.984
He wants us
to keep seeing each other.

31:55.036 --> 31:56.986
And you don't want to risk
the one to have the other.

31:57.038 --> 32:00.123
No. I don't.

32:00.174 --> 32:01.658
I've been there.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.293
I know.

32:03.344 --> 32:08.498
Then you need to figure out
which is more important.

32:08.549 --> 32:11.801
I guess I do.

32:14.639 --> 32:17.273
So you two have, um...

32:17.341 --> 32:19.842
Yes.

32:19.894 --> 32:22.812
So he's seen you naked?

32:22.863 --> 32:25.899
That's usually
how these things work.

32:29.570 --> 32:34.491
Are you picturing me naked
right now?

32:34.542 --> 32:36.459
Maybe.

32:36.527 --> 32:38.211
Yes.

32:38.295 --> 32:40.880
Go wash your hands.

32:45.035 --> 32:47.337
Don't spend too much time
in that bathroom.

32:47.388 --> 32:49.172
Let me get this straight.

32:49.223 --> 32:50.873
You come to me
with a killer idea,

32:50.925 --> 32:52.425
and all of a sudden
you don't want to do it anymore

32:52.510 --> 32:53.977
'cause you lost your BFF?

32:54.044 --> 32:56.596
I don't want to do it because
it's not a killer idea anymore.

32:56.681 --> 32:58.765
- Why the hell not?
- Because Harvey has a conflict,

32:58.849 --> 33:00.889
which means somebody already
has a dog in the fight.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.352
- Who gives a shit?
- I do.

33:02.403 --> 33:05.355
'Cause whoever it is
is already buying shares.

33:05.406 --> 33:06.906
You didn't come in here
to give up.

33:06.991 --> 33:08.525
You came in here
to get my money.

33:08.576 --> 33:09.693
You're damn right
I did.

33:09.744 --> 33:11.528
I give you my money,
now I have downside.

33:11.579 --> 33:13.029
Jonathan, look.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.448
You said you wanted
a home run.

33:15.533 --> 33:16.666
You gotta pull out
your checkbook,

33:16.734 --> 33:18.055
'cause I can't compete
without it.

33:18.068 --> 33:19.869
- You could yesterday.
- Now it's today.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.371
And you're still
going in there

33:21.422 --> 33:22.572
another banker in a suit,

33:22.623 --> 33:25.258
hoping he'll trust you
based on nothing.

33:25.342 --> 33:29.078
I've got more than nothing.

33:29.130 --> 33:31.514
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:31.582 --> 33:33.299
Trust me.

33:33.384 --> 33:35.769
I did my homework.

33:35.853 --> 33:37.487
Batter up.

33:43.967 --> 33:45.224
What are you doing here?

33:45.369 --> 33:46.552
I said I'd tell you

33:46.620 --> 33:47.653
what we were gonna do
with your centers

33:47.704 --> 33:48.987
five seconds after we closed.

33:49.039 --> 33:51.590
When did we close?

33:51.658 --> 33:53.676
About three seconds ago.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.012
I guess we better hurry.

33:58.098 --> 34:00.683
All right, what's going
to happen to my employees?

34:00.767 --> 34:02.435
We're going to sell
your distribution centers

34:02.502 --> 34:04.637
to a pharmaceutical company

34:04.688 --> 34:06.188
as distribution centers.

34:06.273 --> 34:07.440
They use your workers.

34:07.507 --> 34:10.226
They hit the ground running.
Win-win.

34:10.310 --> 34:12.610
You're a man of your word.

34:14.147 --> 34:17.683
But that's not
why you're here.

34:17.734 --> 34:20.319
No, it isn't.

34:20.370 --> 34:22.571
I'm not interested
in selling my business.

34:22.656 --> 34:24.824
I know that,
because I know why

34:24.875 --> 34:26.574
you've thrown your whole life
into this company

34:26.659 --> 34:29.194
and why you chose the movie
business in the first place.

34:29.246 --> 34:31.330
What's your point?

34:31.380 --> 34:34.250
Phillip.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.502
Your son.

34:36.553 --> 34:39.088
You loved watching movies
together.

34:39.172 --> 34:40.840
That's why you started
this company

34:40.891 --> 34:42.808
and why you won't let go
of what it's become

34:42.876 --> 34:43.893
for any amount of money.

34:43.976 --> 34:46.228
How do you know that?

34:46.313 --> 34:48.397
I told you.

34:48.482 --> 34:51.484
I do my homework.

34:53.853 --> 34:55.103
You lost him,

34:55.188 --> 34:56.688
and you needed an outlet,

34:56.739 --> 35:01.077
and that's what this company
is to you now--

35:01.161 --> 35:02.078
your family.

35:02.162 --> 35:04.396
I told you, I'm not selling.

35:04.448 --> 35:06.248
And I told you,
they're coming after you

35:06.333 --> 35:08.400
whether you like it or not.

35:08.452 --> 35:10.336
And the difference
between me and them

35:10.403 --> 35:11.837
is they want to tear
your company apart,

35:11.905 --> 35:13.105
and I want
to keep it together.

35:13.173 --> 35:15.574
You don't have the resources
to do that.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.710
Yes.

35:17.761 --> 35:21.013
I do.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.081
As of an hour ago,
I started investing.

35:23.133 --> 35:27.085
So by this time next week,
I will own 4.9%.

35:27.137 --> 35:29.472
I didn't have
to tell you that.

35:29.556 --> 35:33.275
And that's supposed
to make me trust you?

35:36.596 --> 35:41.033
I lost both of my parents
when I was 11 years old,

35:41.100 --> 35:45.121
so I know a little something
about needing family.

35:45.205 --> 35:48.407
Walter...

35:48.458 --> 35:51.610
I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

35:51.661 --> 35:54.797
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

35:58.385 --> 35:59.969
All right, I'm in.

36:06.810 --> 36:08.794
Listen, Zane,
I want that goddamn filing

36:08.845 --> 36:10.513
on my desk nine seconds ago,
or you can forget

36:10.597 --> 36:11.647
you ever worked here.

36:11.731 --> 36:12.982
Now excuse me.

36:13.066 --> 36:14.567
I've got to go be a dick
to someone.

36:14.634 --> 36:16.685
Sit down.

36:19.072 --> 36:20.823
Is this about you and Mike?

36:20.907 --> 36:23.242
Listen to me--
this is gonna be a street fight,

36:23.309 --> 36:26.111
and there's only gonna be
one man standing when it's over.

36:26.163 --> 36:27.830
So I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

36:27.914 --> 36:28.831
You don't need to.

36:28.915 --> 36:31.333
I don't want out.
I want in.

36:31.418 --> 36:33.452
And when I said, "you want me
to send a message to Mike?"

36:33.503 --> 36:34.670
I meant it.

36:34.754 --> 36:36.672
I was just gonna ask
if you were comfortable

36:36.756 --> 36:37.990
getting me coffee
in the mornings.

36:38.041 --> 36:40.092
I'm serious.

36:40.159 --> 36:42.294
I didn't back down
from a fight with my dad,

36:42.345 --> 36:44.830
and I'm not going to back down
from one with Mike.

36:44.881 --> 36:47.332
Good.

36:47.384 --> 36:49.668
Now, I actually am
gonna get coffee.

36:49.719 --> 36:51.520
Great.
One sugar, a splash of cream,

36:51.605 --> 36:54.056
and don't skimp on the hazelnut.

36:54.140 --> 36:56.358
Too soon.

36:56.443 --> 36:58.510
Instead of failing
to be charming,

36:58.562 --> 37:00.529
why don't you do
something useful and get moving

37:00.614 --> 37:02.865
on drawing up a tender offer
for Logan Sanders?

37:02.949 --> 37:05.234
Logan?
No, you mean Max Sanders.

37:05.318 --> 37:07.119
I keep forgetting that you're
in law school half the time.

37:07.186 --> 37:08.621
Max is retired.

37:08.688 --> 37:11.624
It's Logan's show now.

37:17.047 --> 37:18.163
You wanted to see me?

37:18.215 --> 37:20.382
We need to move up
our timeline.

37:20.467 --> 37:22.885
Well, I'm buying shares
as fast as I can.

37:22.969 --> 37:24.136
I'm talking
about a tender offer.

37:24.203 --> 37:25.804
The plan is shock and awe.

37:25.872 --> 37:27.706
If we rush a tender offer,
we won't have enough leverage

37:27.757 --> 37:29.174
to force people
to vote with us.

37:29.226 --> 37:30.259
It's fine
to have shock and awe

37:30.343 --> 37:31.427
when you're the only one
in the game,

37:31.511 --> 37:32.478
but Walter Gillis
knows we're coming,

37:32.545 --> 37:35.347
and he got himself an ally.

37:35.398 --> 37:36.398
How do you know that?

37:36.483 --> 37:38.550
Because I do.

37:38.602 --> 37:40.269
Your conflict--
who is it?

37:40.353 --> 37:43.022
- I can't talk about it.
- Well, when the hell can you?

37:43.073 --> 37:45.658
In another hour.

37:49.496 --> 37:51.997
You have it for me?

37:52.065 --> 37:54.166
Harvey, you know you can still
get out of this if you want to.

37:54.233 --> 37:56.452
Mike's not gonna sign that thing
if you tell him not to.

37:56.536 --> 37:57.536
It's too late for that.

37:57.587 --> 37:59.255
Oh, my God.

37:59.339 --> 38:01.040
Hey, just the woman
I wanted to see.

38:01.091 --> 38:02.591
Donna, would you happen to have
the measurements

38:02.676 --> 38:03.636
to Hardman's old office?

38:03.677 --> 38:04.677
Louis, get out of my way.

38:04.711 --> 38:07.096
Whoa.
What's going on, Donna?

38:07.180 --> 38:09.265
What's going on?

38:09.349 --> 38:10.549
That bullshit Harvey told you

38:10.600 --> 38:12.768
about waiting
for the girl to call,

38:12.852 --> 38:14.386
it's bullshit.

38:14.437 --> 38:17.589
He waited,
and now it's too late.

38:24.197 --> 38:25.764
Change of plans.
Cancel anything you have.

38:25.815 --> 38:26.815
We're staying here all night.
What for?

38:26.900 --> 38:28.150
The S.E.C.'s coming,

38:28.234 --> 38:29.601
Jessica's hiring one person
to fight 'em,

38:29.653 --> 38:30.819
and first thing tomorrow,

38:30.904 --> 38:32.505
we need to convince her
that person's me.

38:34.541 --> 38:36.441
Hey.

38:36.493 --> 38:38.744
I see you have the movies.
Mmhmm.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.214
I guess that means
you've decided

38:42.281 --> 38:44.282
which relationship
you want us to have.

38:44.334 --> 38:47.503
I have.

38:47.587 --> 38:50.506
But it's not
what you might think.

38:53.727 --> 38:56.145
If you still want the job,

38:56.229 --> 38:58.931
it starts tomorrow.

39:00.934 --> 39:04.269
I do.

39:04.321 --> 39:07.906
Then tonight
is our last night.

39:07.974 --> 39:10.409
We'll see if you still
think that in four hours.

39:10.476 --> 39:12.194
Oh, you want to go
three times?

39:12.278 --> 39:14.163
Oh, I was including
one of the movies.

39:14.247 --> 39:17.116
- No.
- No.

39:36.970 --> 39:38.604
Finally got yourself
an office.

39:38.671 --> 39:42.141
Maybe you forgot,
but I had an office before.

39:42.192 --> 39:43.525
I just gave it back.

39:43.610 --> 39:46.779
I remember,
as a show of loyalty.

39:46.846 --> 39:49.732
Yeah, well, that was then.
This is now.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.788
What you got there, Harvey?

39:55.855 --> 39:57.072
You think you could meet
with Walter Gillis

39:57.157 --> 39:58.657
and I wouldn't find out?

39:58.708 --> 40:00.376
No, I knew you'd find out.

40:00.460 --> 40:03.545
I just didn't care.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.414
Then maybe you won't mind
signing this.

40:05.498 --> 40:08.500
Let me guess.

40:08.551 --> 40:10.669
You want me to waive
the conflict that you still have

40:10.720 --> 40:12.370
after hearing my plan first.

40:12.422 --> 40:15.724
I sure didn't come here
to see your shit-y office.

40:17.727 --> 40:18.761
Aren't you
supposed to be nice

40:18.845 --> 40:20.596
to the person
you need something from?

40:20.680 --> 40:23.432
They're still coming
whether you sign it or not.

40:23.516 --> 40:28.353
If I don't sign it,
they won't be coming with you.

40:28.405 --> 40:30.239
True.

40:30.323 --> 40:33.442
Of course,
if you don't sign it,

40:33.526 --> 40:36.728
it may cause some people to say
you're afraid of me.

40:36.780 --> 40:39.782
And by "some people,"
I mean me.

40:39.866 --> 40:41.566
Of course, if I sign it
just because you said that,

40:41.618 --> 40:44.753
then it might cause some people
to say you baited me.

40:44.838 --> 40:47.572
But I knew you were coming

40:47.624 --> 40:50.259
the second I went to see
Walter Gillis,

40:50.343 --> 40:52.261
so...

40:52.345 --> 40:56.348
I went ahead
and signed one for you.

40:56.415 --> 40:59.384
- I guess it's on.
- I guess it is.

40:59.436 --> 41:02.104
You think we need to lay out
some ground rules?

41:02.188 --> 41:03.922
Rules?
In a knife fight?

41:05.358 --> 41:07.478
I guess somebody ought to yell,
"one, two, three, go."

41:07.560 --> 41:10.762
One, two, three, go.

41:12.431 --> 41:14.266
You know, usually
when someone gets a new office,

41:14.317 --> 41:17.369
you're supposed to bring them
something, right?

41:17.436 --> 41:21.457
Like an orchid or something?

41:21.541 --> 41:23.125
No?

41:23.209 --> 41:26.128
Nothing?

41:34.337 --> 41:36.138
You signed the waiver,
didn't you?

41:36.222 --> 41:37.756
You know I did.

41:37.807 --> 41:40.342
Not gonna back down from Harvey.
Mm.

41:40.426 --> 41:44.963
And I suppose you got Gillis
on board with your plan?

41:45.014 --> 41:49.151
I wouldn't have needed
to sign the waiver if I didn't.

41:49.235 --> 41:50.635
Hey.

41:50.687 --> 41:53.605
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

41:53.656 --> 41:54.740
This thing
between me and Harvey--

41:54.807 --> 41:56.859
it doesn't have to affect us.

41:56.943 --> 42:00.662
We won't let it.

42:00.747 --> 42:02.664
I didn't know
that Logan Sanders

42:02.749 --> 42:05.417
took over his father's company
until today.

42:05.484 --> 42:07.169
What does that have to do
with anything?

42:07.253 --> 42:10.839
- He's Harvey's client.
- Yeah, so?

42:12.926 --> 42:16.929
Do you remember
when I told you that I...

42:16.996 --> 42:20.098
That I once had an affair
with a married man?

42:20.166 --> 42:23.468
It was him.
