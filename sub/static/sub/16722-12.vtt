00:20.466 --> 00:22.067
Lookie, lookie.

00:22.068 --> 00:23.485
My green blazer
from when I had

00:23.486 --> 00:25.233
jury duty on
Saint Patrick's Day.

00:25.238 --> 00:26.705
What's the
blazer for?

00:26.706 --> 00:28.840
Tina's gonna wear it at her
audition tomorrow

00:28.841 --> 00:30.242
for the school
news channel.

00:30.243 --> 00:31.677
I want to be
serious newswoman,

00:31.678 --> 00:33.178
like Holly Hunter
in <i>Broadcast News.</i>

00:33.179 --> 00:35.080
"It must be great being
right all the time.

00:35.081 --> 00:36.080
No, it's terrible."

00:36.082 --> 00:37.549
Aw.

00:37.550 --> 00:40.018
I need to practice being
a television journalist.

00:40.053 --> 00:41.353
Dad, can I
interview you?

00:41.354 --> 00:42.888
Um, okay.

00:42.889 --> 00:44.239
Don't look directly
into the camera, Dad.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.390
I got it.

00:45.391 --> 00:46.658
So, tell me,
why burgers?

00:46.659 --> 00:47.876
Well, my dad got
me started...

00:47.877 --> 00:49.227
Do you see this
as a stepping stone

00:49.228 --> 00:52.230
- to a real restaurant?
- It... is a real restaurant.

00:52.231 --> 00:53.665
Mm, slop shop.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.067
Can you cook anything
other than burgers?

00:55.101 --> 00:56.501
Yes, lots of things.

00:56.536 --> 00:58.570
- Like?
- Like, um...

00:58.571 --> 00:59.671
like, paella.

00:59.706 --> 01:01.773
Paella... tell me
how you make that.

01:01.774 --> 01:04.176
Well, I'd have to look
up the recipe, but, uh...

01:04.177 --> 01:05.711
So you don't know
how to make paella?

01:05.712 --> 01:07.846
No, I could make...

01:07.847 --> 01:08.947
Okay, I'm confused,
because a minute ago

01:08.948 --> 01:10.182
you were an expert.

01:10.183 --> 01:11.750
Dad needs media
coaching.

01:11.784 --> 01:13.518
Look, I randomly
said "paella."

01:13.519 --> 01:14.753
I didn't mean to.

01:14.754 --> 01:15.754
Ah, I'm going
in tight.

01:15.788 --> 01:17.189
Bob, get off paella.

01:17.223 --> 01:18.290
All right,
interview's over.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.591
Get that camera
out of my face.

01:19.626 --> 01:21.293
I think we got
what we need.

01:23.229 --> 01:25.530
You look
amazing, sweetie.

01:25.531 --> 01:27.032
And you're gonna look
even better on camera.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.500
You inherited
my strong chin.

01:28.534 --> 01:29.868
Where's your
strong chin, Mom?

01:29.869 --> 01:30.969
I can't see it.

01:30.970 --> 01:32.904
Keep looking,
you'll find it.

01:32.905 --> 01:34.806
What did I inherit
from you, Mom?

01:34.807 --> 01:36.441
You got my
zest for life.

01:36.442 --> 01:38.143
And my extra
long pinky toe.

01:38.144 --> 01:39.578
And I got your
birthing hips.

01:39.579 --> 01:41.613
Actually, Gene, you take
more after your father.

01:41.614 --> 01:42.781
No, hips don't lie.

01:42.782 --> 01:44.349
Look at this.

01:44.384 --> 01:46.852
I forgot that I went
through a Judd Nelson phase.

01:46.886 --> 01:49.221
That's your father
when he was your age.

01:49.222 --> 01:50.856
He looked just
like you.

01:50.890 --> 01:53.291
Wait, does that mean
when I'm his age,

01:53.292 --> 01:54.493
I'm gonna look
just like him?

01:54.494 --> 01:55.627
Spoiler alert!

01:55.628 --> 01:56.795
No!

01:56.829 --> 01:58.196
Hey, you could do worse.

01:58.231 --> 01:59.665
I don't see how!

01:59.666 --> 02:01.299
At least you know your
shoulders won't go bald.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.467
Gene, it's starting.

02:02.468 --> 02:04.102
I found this
on your pillow!

02:04.103 --> 02:05.303
Ah! Oh, my God!

02:05.304 --> 02:06.772
Quick, come me over!
Trump me!

02:06.806 --> 02:07.973
- Louise...
- What?

02:07.974 --> 02:09.007
You're not going
bald, Gene.

02:09.008 --> 02:10.508
Apologize, Louise.

02:10.509 --> 02:12.644
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

02:12.645 --> 02:14.079
It's okay.

02:14.113 --> 02:16.114
What's the point
of clinging to this,

02:16.115 --> 02:17.449
if I'm doomed
to be that?

02:17.483 --> 02:19.317
- Huh. I don't know.
- Lin.

02:19.352 --> 02:21.086
Why wait?
Let's do it now.

02:21.087 --> 02:22.287
I want the whole Bob.

02:22.288 --> 02:23.789
- Male-pattern baldness.
- Hmm.

02:23.790 --> 02:24.956
- Stoop shoulders.
- Stop.

02:24.957 --> 02:26.291
- Paunch.
- Please.

02:26.292 --> 02:27.426
And the push broom
on my lip.

02:27.427 --> 02:28.760
This is
incredibly insulting.

02:28.761 --> 02:29.961
Think about
how I feel.

02:29.962 --> 02:31.263
You really let
myself go.

02:31.264 --> 02:32.464
Go to school.

02:32.465 --> 02:34.321
- We're going.
- Bye.

02:36.002 --> 02:39.438
Remember, kids, this is just
the student news, no pressure.

02:39.472 --> 02:41.807
I'll only be going
back frame by frame

02:41.808 --> 02:43.542
and critiquing
you on eye contact,

02:43.543 --> 02:45.877
presentation and
how cool you are.

02:45.878 --> 02:47.446
You really want
to do this?

02:48.815 --> 02:50.115
Okay, first up
to the green screen,

02:50.116 --> 02:51.283
Zeke with sports.

02:51.284 --> 02:52.818
Comin' at ya,
Mr. Grant!

02:52.852 --> 02:55.220
That game was tighter than
a tater in a tailpipe.

02:55.221 --> 02:57.489
It was like two babies climbin'
on the same boob.

02:57.490 --> 02:58.824
Then we lost.

02:58.858 --> 03:01.193
Wow, Zeke, I feel
like I was there.

03:01.194 --> 03:03.495
Next up, auditioning
for field reporters,

03:03.496 --> 03:04.896
Andy and Ollie.

03:04.897 --> 03:05.896
Back to you, Andy.

03:05.898 --> 03:07.199
Back to you, Ollie.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.533
- Back to you, Andy.
- Back to you, Ollie.

03:08.568 --> 03:09.801
If only you two
were Siamese twins.

03:09.802 --> 03:10.969
We can do that.

03:10.970 --> 03:12.571
Oh, great!

03:12.572 --> 03:14.840
That'd be super helpful
if you could figure that out.

03:14.841 --> 03:15.941
It looks like
it's working.

03:15.975 --> 03:16.975
We did it!

03:17.009 --> 03:18.543
So sweet.

03:18.544 --> 03:20.946
And, next up, for
the coveted anchor spot, Tammy.

03:20.980 --> 03:22.214
Good luck, Tammy.

03:22.215 --> 03:23.415
Uh, I was born
lucky, Tina.

03:23.416 --> 03:25.183
'Cause I was born me
and not you.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.369
And I'm a blonde now,
so I'm better than you.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.155
I don't like what you say,
but I admire the way you say it.

03:30.189 --> 03:32.691
Wow, it's Tammy with the news!

03:32.692 --> 03:35.527
Whoo! ♪ News...

03:40.399 --> 03:42.200
Oh, hey, Tina,
little tip:

03:42.201 --> 03:45.604
You're a super fast talker,
so talk really slow.

03:45.605 --> 03:46.604
Thanks, Tammy.

03:46.606 --> 03:47.773
Whoa!

03:47.774 --> 03:49.374
That's still
way too fast.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.543
Mr. Grant, I'm here because
I have a nose for news.

03:51.544 --> 03:53.945
Great. Now about
that green jacket...

03:53.946 --> 03:55.180
I'm Tina with...

03:55.214 --> 03:58.450
Tina.

04:13.199 --> 04:14.466
I'm staff intern?

04:14.467 --> 04:16.067
But I already
had a sign-off.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.235
"Good-bye, audience."

04:17.236 --> 04:18.769
Well, maybe you
could change it to

04:18.771 --> 04:19.870
"Does anyone need juice?"

04:19.872 --> 04:21.473
Does anyone
need juice?

04:21.474 --> 04:24.409
Hmm. Maybe it'll work better
when you have some juice.

04:26.932 --> 04:29.150
So, what does the
staff intern do?

04:29.151 --> 04:30.351
Besides go on
juice box runs?

04:30.352 --> 04:31.519
Yeah.
Oh, lots of things.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.854
You know,
hand out the juice,

04:32.855 --> 04:34.505
make sure people are
happy with their juice,

04:34.540 --> 04:36.340
clean up
all the empty juice boxes.

04:36.341 --> 04:38.009
Okay. Isn't there
any other important

04:38.010 --> 04:40.011
behind-the-scenes stuff
I could do to help?

04:40.045 --> 04:42.213
Well, there's editing
music, effects.

04:42.214 --> 04:43.514
That stuff is a blast.
Great.

04:43.515 --> 04:44.782
But I do those.

04:44.783 --> 04:46.484
I mean, if you did them,
what would I do?

04:46.485 --> 04:47.952
Be the teacher?

04:47.953 --> 04:49.053
Yeah, right, Tina,
that sounds great.

04:49.054 --> 04:50.888
I'll just teach.

04:52.324 --> 04:53.858
Little more off the top.

04:53.892 --> 04:56.294
Sprinkle on the back
and the ears.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.328

I got that arm hair

05:05.904 --> 05:07.355

Did Mrs.
Persky's water break?

06:03.746 --> 06:05.146
I may have won
the baby pool.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.448
Worse. Someone dragged in
a dog turd.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.617
And this isn't
the first time, either.

06:09.618 --> 06:11.335
You have great stories,
Mr. Branca.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.204
I ever tell you
you're, like, my best friend?

06:13.205 --> 06:14.872
Oh. Thank you.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.275
Look, this news show competes
for students' attention

06:17.276 --> 06:20.411
with cell phones, gossip
and bathroom graffiti.

06:20.412 --> 06:22.313
We need to be faster, meaner,
and graffiti-er!

06:22.314 --> 06:23.748
So, what I'm...

06:23.749 --> 06:25.416
I have a cran-apple,
two grapes and a bunch

06:25.417 --> 06:26.818
of kiwi-strawberry.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.453
Here's the crazy straw
you asked for, Zeke.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.754
Extra crazy,
just how you like it.

06:29.755 --> 06:31.289
Could be crazier.

the five W's of school news?

06:34.126 --> 06:37.061
Oh, "who, what, where,
when and sometimes why."

06:37.096 --> 06:38.629
Or, is that vowels?

06:38.630 --> 06:40.498
No! They're "wow, woo-hoo,

06:40.499 --> 06:42.900
way hot, weird
and what the mmm."

06:42.935 --> 06:45.636
Every story we do
should have all five.

06:45.637 --> 06:47.872
New kid nip slips!

06:47.906 --> 06:49.073
Way hot, Zeke!

06:49.074 --> 06:50.575
Oh, whose parents
are poor?

06:50.576 --> 06:52.577
Woo-hoo, Tammy!
I've got one.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.580
The custodian says someone
is tracking in dog poo.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.148
What the huh?

06:57.149 --> 06:59.684
Less caca,
more gaga, Tina.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.152
Anyone else?

07:01.153 --> 07:03.187
I hear there's
a 45-year-old fourth grader

07:03.188 --> 07:05.089
with a mustache
walking around school.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.757
Now that's pretty
"what the ah"!

07:06.758 --> 07:08.593
Go with that.

07:08.627 --> 07:10.761
This is WSN,
the news you need

07:10.762 --> 07:12.497
from the students you like.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.265
In your face!

07:14.266 --> 07:17.768
I'm Tammy Larson and these are
the breaking stories.

07:17.769 --> 07:19.537
What's up with Brenda?

07:19.538 --> 07:21.272
I mean, right?

07:21.273 --> 07:23.774
Jimmy Pesto Junior
previews dance moves

07:23.775 --> 07:25.943
the principal won't allow
at winter prom.

07:25.944 --> 07:26.961
This one's out.

07:26.962 --> 07:29.197
Can't do this.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.432
Forget about this one.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.768
I love it,
but it's not news.

07:33.802 --> 07:35.503
Now, to our top story:

07:35.504 --> 07:38.639
Lenny Destefano... is there
enough of him to go around,

07:38.640 --> 07:40.508
and how can we ration
our passion?

07:40.542 --> 07:41.676
Jocelyn, who's Lenny

07:41.677 --> 07:43.044
going to the
winter prom with?

07:43.045 --> 07:44.812
No one knows.
He's going out with Julie,

07:44.813 --> 07:45.847
but he's been texting

07:45.848 --> 07:47.448
the entire
drill team and me.

07:47.449 --> 07:48.983
- And me, also.
- Oh.

07:48.984 --> 07:50.735
Now to Zeke with
dodgeball highlights.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.453
Thanks, Tammy!

07:52.454 --> 07:54.972
Here's a kid getting it
in the muchachos. Ooh!

07:55.007 --> 07:56.807
Here's another dude,
right in the Easter eggs.

07:56.808 --> 07:58.709
Boing!

07:58.744 --> 08:01.295
Watch this geezer
with a 'stache get his.

08:01.296 --> 08:04.692
It's okay,
I've had my kids.

08:06.518 --> 08:08.252
Hey, Tina,
I saw the news.

08:08.253 --> 08:10.555
Is that true about Lenny
and the drill team?

08:10.556 --> 08:12.423
Julie deserves better.

08:12.424 --> 08:14.025
The school deserves
better news.

08:14.059 --> 08:16.060
Well, I just got
back from the library.

08:16.061 --> 08:18.729
More shoe poopy got
dragged in up there.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.498
All the way to the
reference section.

08:20.532 --> 08:22.400
Talk about Encyclopedia Brown.

08:25.654 --> 08:27.154
I... I don't get it.

08:27.155 --> 08:28.689
Wait, that's a pretty
long way to track

08:28.690 --> 08:30.024
something in on a shoe.

08:30.025 --> 08:31.325
I'm gonna
poke around.

08:31.326 --> 08:32.510
Something doesn't
smell right.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.760
That's this.

08:33.761 --> 08:35.162
Oh, yeah.

08:35.163 --> 08:38.282
So it is applesauce,
but try to find it

08:38.283 --> 08:39.784
in the sauce aisle
at the supermarket.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.118
You'll be sorely
disappointed.

08:41.119 --> 08:42.787
Anyway, I was
looking for chutney.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.388
Uh, is this a long
story, Teddy?

08:44.389 --> 08:46.557
I mean, it has been
long, but is it longer?

08:46.558 --> 08:48.226
I haven't gotten to
the story part yet.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.394
Gene, I need you
behind the counter.

08:50.395 --> 08:52.463
Just stand here and
I'll be right back.

08:52.464 --> 08:53.864
I'm not sure
I appreciate

08:53.865 --> 08:55.700
being foisted off
like this, Bob.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.568
So, anyway, I end up

08:57.569 --> 08:59.604
in the ethnic food section.
Mm-hmm.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.439
- It was like a whole new world opened up.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.207
I bought baby food
from India.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.475
Those babies are tough.

09:04.476 --> 09:05.710
No joke on those slices.

09:05.711 --> 09:06.978
That's fascinating,
Teddy.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.279
Little Bob is great.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.614
Yeah, I guess
I'll keep him.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.715
Lin, stop.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.866
You stop.
No, stop, Lin.

09:11.867 --> 09:12.967
No, you stop,
little Bobby.

09:12.968 --> 09:15.253
Mm-hmm, stop.
Bobby, stop.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.388
Look at you two, you're like
an old married couple.

09:17.422 --> 09:18.923
We put up
with each other.

09:18.924 --> 09:19.957
All right, enough, Gene.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.292
Gene, get back to the kitchen.

09:21.326 --> 09:23.094
How could dog poop
make it all the way

09:23.095 --> 09:25.062
up two flights of
stairs and into the library

09:25.063 --> 09:27.131
on a shoe without
being wiped off?

09:27.132 --> 09:28.232
Tele-poop-tation?

09:28.233 --> 09:29.232
Let's experiment.

09:29.234 --> 09:30.668
We need something

09:30.669 --> 09:32.603
the exact same size
and texture as poop.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.071
How about Dad's burger?

09:34.072 --> 09:35.573
It's even the same color!

09:35.574 --> 09:36.674
Great idea.

09:40.178 --> 09:41.979
What the hell
are you kids doing?

09:41.980 --> 09:43.481
Walking on one
of Dad's burgers

09:43.482 --> 09:45.316
to see how much
like dog doo it is.

09:45.317 --> 09:46.751
Oh, science.

09:46.785 --> 09:48.753
It's clean. That can mean
only one thing:

09:48.754 --> 09:51.455
The poos must have come from
inside the school.

09:51.490 --> 09:54.558
Which means,
they're probably human!

09:54.593 --> 09:56.127
I knew there was
a story there.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.296
We're looking at
a serial pooper.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.397
Oh, my God.

09:59.431 --> 10:00.982
Is it you, Louise?

10:01.016 --> 10:02.617
I've dabbled
in the area,

10:02.618 --> 10:06.170
but I don't get enough
food to be a serial pooper.

10:06.171 --> 10:08.322
I, uh, probably only
poop once a week.

10:08.323 --> 10:10.625
I think I'll call the culprit
the Mad Pooper.

10:10.659 --> 10:12.026
Ooh, I got a better one.

10:12.027 --> 10:14.228
The Butt-ler.
Get it?

10:14.262 --> 10:16.282
I get it.
It's got "butt" in it.

10:16.298 --> 10:18.015
Butt.

10:18.016 --> 10:21.786
Whatever we call him or her,
it's definitely news.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.188
<i>That's toilet
journalism, Tina.</i>

10:24.189 --> 10:25.856
We do gutter journalism.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.958
But there's a Mad Pooper
loose in the school.

10:27.959 --> 10:30.227
It's the job of the news
to inform the public.

10:30.228 --> 10:32.563
It's worth it, even if
we save just one shoe.

10:32.564 --> 10:33.664
Yuck.

10:33.665 --> 10:34.899
Well said, Tammy.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.035
The Mad Pooper story
is ten times bigger

10:38.036 --> 10:39.804
than Lenny Destefano's
love life.

10:39.838 --> 10:41.372
And less disgusting.

10:41.373 --> 10:43.374
He'll put his lips on
anything with pom-poms.

10:43.408 --> 10:45.042
But I can't get
it out there.

10:45.043 --> 10:46.577
WSN has a news monopoly.

10:46.578 --> 10:47.978
So do your
own newscast.

10:47.979 --> 10:49.180
My own newscast?

10:49.181 --> 10:50.865
You think I
could do that?

10:50.899 --> 10:53.634
Who's the one yammering
about her nose for news?

10:53.669 --> 10:55.469
Me?
Yeah, this nose right here!

10:55.470 --> 10:56.837
Ow!

10:56.838 --> 10:58.823
Get it sniffing!
Snort some news up there!

10:58.824 --> 11:01.392
I can't snort
'cause you're holding my nose.

11:01.393 --> 11:03.027
There's gonna be
lots of things

11:03.028 --> 11:04.245
holding you back!

11:04.246 --> 11:05.680
- Okay.
- Snort it up!

11:05.681 --> 11:07.648
Come on,
Cronkite, snort!

11:07.649 --> 11:09.550
It's for the good
of the people!

11:09.551 --> 11:11.819
Let me know when
you got something.

11:12.988 --> 11:16.824
My diorama...
got diarrheaed.

11:16.858 --> 11:18.893
I think I just
snorted a story.

11:20.562 --> 11:23.967
Dad's old camcorder,
a VCR and a videotape?

11:23.968 --> 11:26.503
Say hello to your
state-of-the-art studio.

11:26.537 --> 11:28.171
But, this is Gene's birth.

11:28.206 --> 11:29.573
There's a lot of
crowning stuff

11:29.574 --> 11:30.874
that can just be
taped over.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.776
Looks like an
angry softball

11:32.777 --> 11:34.511
trying to get
out of a coin purse.

11:34.545 --> 11:35.746
Hmm, okay.

11:35.747 --> 11:37.414
Listen, princess,

11:37.415 --> 11:38.949
I don't even know what
you're talking about,

11:38.950 --> 11:40.817
but you can do anything
you set your mind to.

11:40.818 --> 11:42.302
And, no matter what,

11:42.303 --> 11:44.705
your mother and I will
always love you.

11:44.706 --> 11:46.039
He's good.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.041
That kid just fathered
the crap out of you.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.209
He did... okay.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.477
I did great.

11:50.478 --> 11:51.912
Little preachy.

11:51.913 --> 11:53.997
You got a lot of
shine on you, Tina.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.901
How did you get equal time
on the school network?

11:57.935 --> 11:59.303
I told Principal
Spoors I had

11:59.304 --> 12:00.937
incriminating
pictures of him.

12:00.938 --> 12:02.272
Because I drew
some incriminating

12:02.273 --> 12:03.573
pictures of him.

12:03.608 --> 12:05.409
Great, let's do this.

12:10.181 --> 12:11.948
These halls are calm now.

12:11.949 --> 12:14.201
But on Wednesday,
it was a different story.

12:14.235 --> 12:16.420
I left my shoebox
diorama for a minute

12:16.454 --> 12:18.255
and someone
pooped in it.

12:18.289 --> 12:21.408
It was about the
Industrial Revolution.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.478
Some call him the Mad Pooper.

12:24.479 --> 12:26.313
My mom calls him the Butt-ler.

12:26.347 --> 12:27.998
By any name,
these brown thumbtacks

12:27.999 --> 12:29.299
tell a tale of terror.

12:29.334 --> 12:31.534
Excuse me, can I
go get my medicine

12:31.535 --> 12:32.819
at the nurse's office?

12:32.820 --> 12:34.137
Shh. I'm watching this.

12:34.138 --> 12:35.505
Oh. Oh, no.

12:35.539 --> 12:36.790
Who would do such a thing?

12:36.791 --> 12:38.792
We turn to an expert,
Mr. Frond.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.194
It's someone
trying to communicate.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.763
Likely, a foreign-
exchange student.

12:42.764 --> 12:44.965
He or she has something
inside them

12:44.966 --> 12:47.167
they desperately
want to get out.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.935
- Rage?
- Poo.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.837
And what do Wagstaff
students think?

12:50.872 --> 12:53.040
My message to the
Mad Pooper is:

12:53.041 --> 12:54.424
Grow up! I did.

12:54.459 --> 12:56.660
Whoever the Mad Pooper is,
he or she

12:56.661 --> 12:57.861
is probably not finished.

12:57.862 --> 12:59.463
And if they're not, I'm not.

12:59.464 --> 13:01.365
In the hall,
I'm Tina Belcher.

13:01.366 --> 13:02.649
And we're clear.

13:02.650 --> 13:03.784
Yes, I did it.

13:03.785 --> 13:04.801
Take that, Tammy.

13:04.836 --> 13:06.136
And Holly Hunter.

13:06.137 --> 13:07.337
I lied, we're not clear.

13:07.338 --> 13:08.805
Okay, now we're clear.

13:08.806 --> 13:10.173
I'll just edit
that part out.

13:10.174 --> 13:11.475
Oh, okay, good.

13:41.723 --> 13:44.491
Ah, damn it,
we got poop-scooped!

13:44.492 --> 13:46.426
Tina's story is all
anyone's talking about.

13:46.427 --> 13:48.028
Tammy, what happened?

13:48.029 --> 13:50.063
Well, you said gaga, not caca.

13:50.098 --> 13:51.932
This caca is gaga!

13:51.933 --> 13:53.400
Now get me that story.

13:53.434 --> 13:55.418
I don't know how.

13:55.436 --> 13:57.537
Do it, or I'll replace
you with the weird twins.

13:57.572 --> 13:59.306
Back to you, Andy!
Back to you, Ollie!

13:59.340 --> 14:01.575
Whoa, okay, no, no, no!
Forget it.

14:01.577 --> 14:04.161
Hey, Tina, great
Mad Pooper reporting.

14:04.162 --> 14:05.562
Thanks.

14:05.563 --> 14:07.330
Can I copy you like
I do in math class?

14:07.331 --> 14:08.665
Real news isn't
about copying.

14:08.666 --> 14:10.333
And you shouldn't
copy me in math.

14:10.334 --> 14:11.935
Yeah, well, you
should get a tutor,

14:11.936 --> 14:13.103
'cause I got a "C."

14:13.104 --> 14:15.071
You got a "C"?
Wait, I got a "D."

14:15.072 --> 14:16.873
You know what?
I'll do my own story.

14:16.874 --> 14:19.059
And it'll be way better
than yours, you lame-pon.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.427
Good, I hope it is.
It will be.

14:20.428 --> 14:21.695
Because then we'll have
more information

14:21.696 --> 14:23.280
about the Mad Pooper...

14:23.281 --> 14:24.698
Tina, we're trash-talking;
Stop turning it into

14:24.699 --> 14:25.732
a normal conversation.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.768
Oh. Sorry.
Um, skank?

14:27.769 --> 14:28.802
That's much better!

14:28.803 --> 14:30.370
Uh, I hate
your new hair color.

14:30.371 --> 14:31.588
Give it to me!

14:31.589 --> 14:34.541
Your eye shadow
is a little much.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.143
In the face!
My face!

14:38.379 --> 14:41.782
Is Tina the Mad Pooper?

14:41.783 --> 14:43.917
What if actual
surveillance footage existed

14:43.918 --> 14:45.552
showing Tina in the act?

14:45.553 --> 14:47.454
Let's go to a reenactment
of what that footage

14:47.455 --> 14:48.488
might look like.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.560
She was always so quiet.
Yeah, she kept to herself.

14:53.561 --> 14:55.128
Yeah, she did.
She did.

14:55.163 --> 14:58.064
So, did Tina create
the very story she reported on?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.699
Mr. Grant is here to comment.

14:59.734 --> 15:01.601
When Tina auditioned,
frankly,

15:01.602 --> 15:03.687
I was physically
afraid of her ambition.

15:03.688 --> 15:05.522
She would've done
anything to get on TV.

15:05.523 --> 15:07.457
And now, apparently,
she has.

15:07.492 --> 15:12.762
Ah. And what if WSN had
an exclusive video confession?

15:12.797 --> 15:14.698
Me... Tina... are... Mad... Pooper.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.434
You don't believe that

15:17.435 --> 15:19.102
just because it was
on TV, right?

15:19.136 --> 15:20.637
Got it. Tina?

15:20.638 --> 15:22.155
Principal's office, now.

15:28.029 --> 15:29.429
I didn't do it.

15:29.430 --> 15:30.630
Follow the money.

15:30.665 --> 15:32.715
I'll take a poop
detector test.

15:32.716 --> 15:34.551
Poop on me once,
shame on you.

15:34.552 --> 15:36.937
Poop on me twice, we're
not best friends anymore!

15:40.806 --> 15:43.107
It's not me, it was
a reenactment.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.510
If it didn't happen,
then how could they reenact it?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.111
Huh. Uh, yeah.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.447
Oh, you should be a teacher
instead of secretary,

15:49.448 --> 15:51.115
Ms. Schnur.
I know.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.817
Louise, why are you here?

15:52.818 --> 15:53.828
Tammy didn't frame you.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.286
Unrelated charge.

15:56.321 --> 15:59.273
And now we wait.

15:59.308 --> 16:00.975
At least you're
guilty of something.

16:00.976 --> 16:02.477
I got framed.

16:02.478 --> 16:04.512
Cry to Principal Spoors
when he gets back

16:04.513 --> 16:06.447
from the anti-smoking assembly.

16:06.448 --> 16:08.016
Oh, my God, the assembly!

16:08.017 --> 16:09.183
The whole school
is there.

16:09.184 --> 16:10.518
Can you think of
a better place

16:10.519 --> 16:11.853
for the Mad Pooper
to strike?

16:11.854 --> 16:13.488
The Super Bowl,
<i>American Idol,</i>

16:13.489 --> 16:15.690
Westminster Dog Show,
upside-down roller coaster,

16:15.691 --> 16:16.991
International
Space Station,

16:16.992 --> 16:18.292
yoga retreat, inside
a T-shirt gun...

16:18.293 --> 16:20.028
If I could just
get out of here,

16:20.029 --> 16:21.195
I could clear
my name.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.782
I'll take care
of Ms. Schnur.

16:24.783 --> 16:28.786
Oh, no, look, they're towing
a high-mileage, smallish car

16:28.787 --> 16:30.621
with a bumper sticker

16:30.622 --> 16:31.856
about a personal
passion maybe?

16:31.857 --> 16:33.324
"My other car's a cat"?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.492
That's the one!

16:34.493 --> 16:35.693
No!

16:35.728 --> 16:37.995
I hope Ms. Schnur's
car's okay.

16:37.996 --> 16:38.995
Go, Tina!

16:38.997 --> 16:40.207
Oh, yeah.

16:43.485 --> 16:45.486
All right, missy,
this better be good.

16:45.487 --> 16:46.988
Louise, where's
your sister?

16:47.022 --> 16:49.490
Tina's not here, Gene.
Don't you sass me!

16:49.525 --> 16:51.926
Hey, I don't even let Dad
talk to me like that.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.694
We got here
as soon as we could.

16:53.695 --> 16:55.139
Gene, what are
you doing here?

16:55.164 --> 16:57.248
They called me!
No, they called me.

16:57.249 --> 16:59.884
I can't believe my daughter
is the Butt-ler.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.385
I have no daughter!

17:01.386 --> 17:02.820
Oh, don't say that, Gene.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.188
Yes, he should
say that.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.690
Come on,
she's down at the assembly

17:05.691 --> 17:07.492
trying to
clear her name.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.528
Our lives were so much
simpler before the rug rats.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.829
We use to see movies...

17:11.829 --> 17:12.930
Lin!

17:12.931 --> 17:14.232
Sorry, but
it's true.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.970
Cigarettes are the real
devil sticks.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.405
Nicotine is a bad scene.

17:24.259 --> 17:26.611
You're here somewhere,
Mad Pooper.

17:28.163 --> 17:30.064
Let's stay focused;
We got to find Tin...

17:30.065 --> 17:31.365
Ooh, jugglers!

17:31.400 --> 17:33.251
Hey, can I get a light?

17:33.252 --> 17:35.346
Sure, smoke 'em
if you got 'em.

17:35.370 --> 17:36.704
This is kind of
a weird message.

17:36.705 --> 17:37.839
I really want
a cigarette.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.006
I really want
to juggle.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.108
- No sign?
- Nothing.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.934
Oh, my God, look.
The Pooper.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.769
I need to get up there.
But how?

17:51.770 --> 17:52.947
You could use that

17:52.971 --> 17:54.071
hydraulic scissor lift.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.873
Perfect.
I'll sneak up on him.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.492
I'll be as quiet
as a mouse.

17:57.526 --> 17:59.961
Kelly Mathis and Jocelyn are
wearing the same scrunchie.

17:59.962 --> 18:02.597
But Jocelyn is definitely
wearing it better.

18:02.598 --> 18:03.865
Mr. Grant, look.

18:03.899 --> 18:06.484
It's Tina.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.919
What's she doing
up there?

18:07.953 --> 18:09.253
Maybe she is
the Mad Pooper.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.454
Hey, we're better
than we thought.

18:10.455 --> 18:11.454
Let's get that camera.

18:11.456 --> 18:12.623
Yeah, catch her
in the act.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.724
On the big screen!

18:13.725 --> 18:15.393
That's a big load
of news.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.229
Look, everyone!

18:18.230 --> 18:19.747
It's the Mad Pooper!

18:19.781 --> 18:21.782
Ah, it's Tina!

18:21.783 --> 18:23.651
Tina, what are you doing?
Get down!

18:25.838 --> 18:27.672
Oh, my God!

18:27.673 --> 18:30.675
Come out of the shadows,
Mad Pooper.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.880
- Zeke?
- Surprised?

18:35.914 --> 18:38.082
Zeke's the Butt-ler!

18:38.116 --> 18:39.417
Why'd you do it, Zeke?

18:39.418 --> 18:41.328
Well, the first time
was an accident.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.087
But the second time
was for fun.

18:43.088 --> 18:45.156
Then accident, fun, fun,

18:45.157 --> 18:47.158
another accident,
three funs in a row,

18:47.159 --> 18:49.327
then after that,
I was doing it for you, Tina.

18:49.361 --> 18:50.755
- Aw.
- Aw.

18:50.779 --> 18:52.079
But now it's over.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.214
It's not over.

18:53.248 --> 18:55.449
I got one left!
Zeke, no.

18:55.484 --> 18:57.101
Poop! Poop! Poop!

18:57.102 --> 19:00.181
Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!

19:00.205 --> 19:02.640
Stupid kids, listen to them.
Poop's not funny.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.676
I mean, it is a little, but
what sort of message are we...

19:05.677 --> 19:07.929
I can't stand it!
I want to see him poop!

19:07.930 --> 19:09.664
I want to be a kid again!

19:09.665 --> 19:11.182
Poop! Poop! Poop!

19:11.183 --> 19:13.050
Oh, thank God.
He's back.

19:13.051 --> 19:15.920
Aw, I'll miss my
Muppet Baby Bobby.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.198
You don't have
to do this.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.923
Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!

19:18.957 --> 19:21.158
Here we go.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.158
This isn't an accident!

19:22.160 --> 19:23.628
No, it is, it is.

19:23.629 --> 19:24.829
Oh, God. Oh, boy.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.832
It's taking a long time.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.066
It's a girl!

19:29.067 --> 19:30.301
Uh, no, it's a boy!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.503
I guess we're really
watching this.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.005
Bobby, hold my hand.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.273
Get out of there!

19:35.307 --> 19:37.058
No!

19:37.059 --> 19:38.993
Tammy, look out!

19:38.994 --> 19:41.896
No...!

19:45.801 --> 19:49.003
The Mad Pooper
almost nails me.

19:49.004 --> 19:51.772
I'm joined by the girl
who saved my hair.

19:51.807 --> 19:54.275
Louise, it was
so close.

19:54.309 --> 19:56.043
I thought
it was going to be

19:56.044 --> 19:57.912
a lot closer, Tammy,
to be honest.

19:57.913 --> 19:59.146
But I miscalculated.

19:59.147 --> 20:00.681
Wind, maybe.

20:00.716 --> 20:02.883
I was scared there was gonna
be poop right into my mouth.

20:02.918 --> 20:05.853
Let's go to
the Mad Pooper himself, Zeke,

20:05.854 --> 20:07.555
who, incredibly,
is not in trouble.

20:07.556 --> 20:08.723
Let's find out why.

20:08.757 --> 20:10.558
My family moves around a lot.

20:10.559 --> 20:12.760
His family moves around a lot.

20:12.761 --> 20:15.513
Uh, WSN would like
to apologize for any

20:15.514 --> 20:17.214
inadvertent suggestion
that Tina Belcher

20:17.215 --> 20:18.616
was the Mad Pooper.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.217
Our bad.

20:20.218 --> 20:23.097
The Tina Table.

20:23.121 --> 20:24.722
Is it getting hot in here?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.957
One study shows
the school nurse's thermometer

20:25.958 --> 20:27.191
is off by one degree.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.060
She's here to
discuss it.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.612
Later, I'll talk to students
about trading snacks at lunch.

20:31.613 --> 20:32.913
Is it insider trading?

20:32.914 --> 20:34.275
No, it isn't.

20:34.283 --> 20:36.050
Look at my news girl,

20:36.051 --> 20:37.880
her pretty head floating
like a balloon.

20:37.881 --> 20:40.619
Is it just me, or does Tina
look great without a torso?

20:40.620 --> 20:43.385
Wonder how'd she look with
a mustache and a bald spot?

20:43.386 --> 20:46.165
Oh, I just remembered
how to make paella.
