WEBVTT

00:07.060 --> 00:09.860
Oh, yeah, young Trevor here
owes me 1,500 bucks, yeah?

00:09.895 --> 00:12.540
I'm not looking for it tomorrow,
but I'm not forgetting it either.

00:12.575 --> 00:13.820
Well, I'm Mick Hurley's girlfriend.

00:13.855 --> 00:14.900
Have you seen Freeman?

00:14.935 --> 00:18.540
I trust him to look after my girl.
He goes and FUCKS HER!

00:18.575 --> 00:20.060
What's this young girl
to you, Jo?

00:20.095 --> 00:22.060
She's my fucking step-daughter!

00:22.095 --> 00:23.540
I'm gonna kill that fucking bastard!

00:23.575 --> 00:25.620
You're gonna have to pay me
or kill me, Trevor.

00:27.135 --> 00:28.660
FUCK OFF!

00:28.695 --> 00:31.060
Hiding anything in there, are we?

00:32.494 --> 00:35.700
Look, Kay, if you talk to us now,
we won't come after you.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.500
I didn't say anything.

00:37.535 --> 00:39.740
Take him away from me,
I'll kill you.

00:39.775 --> 00:42.260
Until you can feel
somebody else's pain,

00:42.295 --> 00:44.140
you can't love anybody.

00:44.175 --> 00:46.420
Terry knows
no-one said anything?

00:46.455 --> 00:48.620
Yep, but you and I'll
have to go over there,

00:48.655 --> 00:50.815
sort out a few things face to face.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.971
<b>d It's a jungle out there</b>

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.820 --> 01:08.651
<b>d It's a jungle out there</b>

01:26.620 --> 01:28.850
<b>d It's a jungle out there. d</b>

01:57.135 --> 01:58.780
You alright in there, love?

01:58.815 --> 02:02.860
Yeah. Just powdering my nose.

02:02.895 --> 02:06.620
JACQUl: There are moments
when the world is a very small place.

02:06.655 --> 02:09.139
Moments of tension,

02:09.175 --> 02:11.380
doubt, uncertainty.

02:11.415 --> 02:14.740
But our angels
are always closer than we think.

02:14.775 --> 02:16.460
She won't be long.

02:16.495 --> 02:18.020
How's she been?

02:33.940 --> 02:35.740
Something's gotta be done, Terry.

02:35.775 --> 02:40.660
Supply is erratic and then your
mate Marty, Mr bloody Asia,

02:40.695 --> 02:44.220
the junk that he's sending us
is about as potent as kiddies' wee.

02:44.255 --> 02:45.740
I'll talk to him.

02:45.775 --> 02:50.340
My consortium are thinking it's time
we dealt with the supplier direct.

02:50.375 --> 02:51.820
Cut out the middle man.

02:51.855 --> 02:54.100
Got Marty's number, have you, Bob?

02:54.135 --> 02:56.100
Or you know someone else
with a direct line

02:56.135 --> 02:57.660
to the growers
in the Golden Triangle?

03:02.780 --> 03:04.620
I'll talk to him.

03:04.655 --> 03:07.140
He's in Thailand now,
sourcing a big load.

03:07.175 --> 03:10.740
Some of it's coming here,
but I'll make sure you get the cream.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.220
OK?

03:13.735 --> 03:17.056
Everything sorted?
You tell me.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.780
Well, with the changes
in the Narcotics Bureau,

03:23.815 --> 03:27.380
Bob and I are wondering
if we should get Brian Alexander

03:27.415 --> 03:30.100
to liaise directly
with the NSW police from now on.

03:33.615 --> 03:35.820
Kensington Gardens is so lovely.

03:35.855 --> 03:39.096
And these are so House of York
I couldn't resist them.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.380
Hi, I'm Karen.

03:43.415 --> 03:44.369
Hey.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.340
Bob Jones.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.060
Nice to meet you, Karen.

03:50.095 --> 03:53.300
Nice to meet you, Bob.
And we've met, haven't we?

03:53.335 --> 03:54.580
Allison.

03:54.615 --> 03:57.580
They're over from Australia.
On business.

03:57.615 --> 03:59.013
Right.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.740
I'd better get these into water.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.340
I'll do it. I'll do it.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.217
Didn't you wanna go shopping?

04:07.260 --> 04:08.860
Did I?

04:08.895 --> 04:11.180
I think so.

04:11.215 --> 04:12.932
Did I?

04:16.700 --> 04:18.260
Nice to meet you, Bob.

04:18.295 --> 04:19.692
Allison.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.500
Pay the cops direct.
They're all bent as bananas.

04:26.535 --> 04:28.300
Well, we need more couriers.

04:28.335 --> 04:31.500
Well, if they're on to using single girls,
use couples.

04:31.535 --> 04:35.620
Though Aussie retail's not really
my territory anymore, is it?

04:35.655 --> 04:38.060
We're all in this together, Tel.

04:38.095 --> 04:39.660
Indeed we are.

04:39.695 --> 04:41.537
Aren't we, Allison?

04:43.180 --> 04:44.820
Ally.

04:44.855 --> 04:49.018
I heard the narcs went really hard
on you and Kay.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.780
I didn't tell them anything.

04:52.815 --> 04:55.089
Oh, I know you didn't.
I know you didn't.

04:56.940 --> 04:58.940
But Kay.
She didn't say...

04:58.975 --> 05:02.460
She told them she knew me!
There's no call to shout, mate.

05:02.495 --> 05:04.140
Brian Alexander
saw the record of the interview.

05:04.175 --> 05:07.140
Black and white -
"Yes, I know Terry Clark. "

05:07.175 --> 05:09.060
Just knowing you is nothing.

05:09.095 --> 05:11.420
I know how these pricks work, mate.

05:11.455 --> 05:13.540
They'll reinterview her.
They'll chip away at her.

05:13.575 --> 05:15.580
Next time it'll be,
"Yes, I worked for him. "

05:15.615 --> 05:17.900
Then they apply more pressure,
the floodgates open

05:17.935 --> 05:20.820
and she drowns me, you,
all of us in shit!

05:20.855 --> 05:22.572
She won't.

05:23.660 --> 05:26.900
Kay's not like that.
Is she still at the house?

05:26.935 --> 05:29.380
She moved out.
Where to?

05:29.415 --> 05:32.452
She's gone travelling.
Where to?

05:34.140 --> 05:35.820
I don't know her address.

05:35.855 --> 05:38.414
You're her best friend
and you don't have her address.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.820
Ally, I don't want to hurt her.

05:42.855 --> 05:44.620
I'm worried about her.

05:44.655 --> 05:48.738
I can put her somewhere safe
where the narcs can't hassle her.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.020
Oh, God.

05:52.055 --> 05:54.180
I'm sorry.

05:54.215 --> 05:56.180
It's terrible,

05:56.215 --> 05:58.500
you girls being treated like that.

05:58.535 --> 06:01.460
I wanna look after Kay.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.098
I wanna look after you.

06:05.940 --> 06:08.215
Are you sure you don't know
where I can find her?

06:10.700 --> 06:12.770
I need to go toilet.

06:27.580 --> 06:29.860
It must be
the time of the month.

06:29.895 --> 06:32.740
So, you think we need to...

06:32.775 --> 06:34.378
...little Kay?

06:35.540 --> 06:37.020
Yes.

06:37.055 --> 06:39.693
But she's not our biggest threat.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.019
Who beside you and me knows most
about the organisation?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.820
Marty.

06:48.855 --> 06:50.890
Marty doesn't know shit.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.460
Allison?

06:54.495 --> 06:58.100
She's this close to cracking on us,
mate. I can feel it.

06:58.135 --> 07:01.500
She's taken more risks for us
than you've had hot roots.

07:01.535 --> 07:03.540
You said yourself,

07:03.575 --> 07:06.260
she couldn't get out of bed,

07:06.295 --> 07:08.854
couldn't leave the house,
couldn't make decisions.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.020
Well, she's been through a rough patch,
but she's pulling together.

07:13.055 --> 07:15.020
Next time the narcs
get a hold of her,

07:15.055 --> 07:16.499
she won't pull together.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.900
Well, I'm not organising this one.

07:26.935 --> 07:28.731
You have to, mate.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.860
Hello?

07:49.895 --> 07:51.300
Kay, it's me.

07:51.335 --> 07:53.420
Jeez, Ally, have you forgotten
about the time difference?

07:53.455 --> 07:56.140
Kay, listen to me.
You have got to get out of there.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.140
Why? Are the narcs after me?

07:58.175 --> 08:00.290
Not the narcs. Terry.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.572
I've got a daughter her age!

08:05.060 --> 08:06.820
And let me tell you -

08:06.855 --> 08:12.300
however many you organise,
it never gets natural.

08:12.335 --> 08:13.940
You owe me this.
Bulls poop I do!

08:13.975 --> 08:17.220
I have a son in New Zealand and I can
never go back there! Or Australia!

08:17.255 --> 08:18.740
Because you fucked up

08:18.775 --> 08:20.220
the Wilsons, Bob.

08:20.255 --> 08:23.620
You promised me they would never be
found and three weeks later -

08:23.655 --> 08:25.140
three weeks later! -

08:25.175 --> 08:27.300
they are dug up in a grave so shallow

08:27.335 --> 08:29.450
I'm surprised
you didn't smell them in Sydney.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.409
All I'm asking you to do
is keep looking out for us.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.178
Sorry about that.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.460
So, where were we?

09:03.495 --> 09:04.860
Kay.

09:04.895 --> 09:08.978
Yeah. Right, if I get her address,
I'll pass it on to you.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.380
So is there more we need to discuss?

09:13.415 --> 09:14.893
Don't think so. Bob?

09:15.940 --> 09:17.700
I'm glad you two came over.

09:17.735 --> 09:20.020
It's important
to be on the same page.

09:20.055 --> 09:21.500
Absolutely.

09:21.535 --> 09:23.380
Do you wanna go sightseeing?

09:23.415 --> 09:24.980
Shopping?

09:25.015 --> 09:26.459
I don't know.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.060
I'll ring the airport

09:29.095 --> 09:32.500
and see if I can get us an earlier flight
out of this shithole.

09:32.535 --> 09:34.092
It's goodbye, then.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.540
See you, Dad.

09:39.575 --> 09:41.610
Yep. See you, son.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.932
Goodbye to you too, Allison.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.569
Terry?

10:11.700 --> 10:13.736
Have they gone?

10:16.340 --> 10:18.649
I bought enough veal
if you wanna invite them to dinner.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.060
You know earlier

10:29.095 --> 10:31.340
when you made it clear
that you didn't want me around?

10:31.375 --> 10:32.820
I took the hint

10:32.855 --> 10:35.220
because I didn't wanna embarrass you
in front of those people.

10:35.255 --> 10:39.020
But if you think you can treat me
like I'm not here,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.614
like another stupid
little Kiwi slut...

10:47.340 --> 10:49.092
It's his birthday.

11:38.220 --> 11:39.653
I love you.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.660
Fuck me!

11:57.695 --> 12:00.900
George Freeman's
been shot in the head!

12:00.935 --> 12:03.940
In his own driveway.

12:03.975 --> 12:06.740
Oh, no-one's safe
in this world anymore.

12:06.775 --> 12:11.620
Delighted to see you're recovering
so well, Mr Freeman.

12:11.655 --> 12:14.540
Um... look, I didn't mean
any of the things I said,

12:14.575 --> 12:19.340
um, I'm really grateful
that you looked after Nat so well.

12:19.375 --> 12:23.128
Um, and these are a token
of my esteem.

12:24.180 --> 12:26.380
Very generous, Michael.

12:26.415 --> 12:27.813
Now fuck off.

12:30.940 --> 12:32.420
Three jacks.

12:34.415 --> 12:35.940
Don't worry about the phone.

12:35.975 --> 12:38.620
Just be some other dickhead ringing up
to give me his alibi.

12:38.655 --> 12:40.100
More visitors, Mr Freeman.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.460
Was that Mick Hurley I saw
whizzing past like a cat on fire?

12:43.495 --> 12:45.660
G'day, Lenny.
Dennis.

12:45.695 --> 12:47.300
How's the patient?

12:47.335 --> 12:49.575
Alive.
No thanks to you pricks.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.692
Rustle up some glasses,
will you, Trev?

12:58.420 --> 13:00.220
Give us all the gory details.

13:00.255 --> 13:02.980
Bullet went in here,
through my mouth, out through my eye.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.255
Half-inch higher,
it would've blown a hole in my brain.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.458
You're a lucky bugger.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.580
Quack's orders.

13:13.615 --> 13:15.180
No, it's purely medicinal,
I promise.

13:15.215 --> 13:18.092
And I promise you, mate, we're gonna
get the motherfucker who did this.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.572
Looked in your own squad rooms?

13:24.340 --> 13:25.900
Wasn't State coppers, George.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.856
None of my blokes.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.019
You got my word.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.500
Your good health, then.

13:35.535 --> 13:36.979
And yours.
Good health.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.180
So, did you get a look
at the shooter, Mr Freeman?

13:41.215 --> 13:43.660
Too dark,
and he was wearing a balaclava.

13:43.695 --> 13:45.340
You got any enemies?

13:45.375 --> 13:47.620
None that are prepared to say it
to my face, son.

13:47.655 --> 13:50.020
Well, your visitor just now,
his name's been mentioned.

13:50.055 --> 13:51.500
It's not Michael Hurley.

13:51.535 --> 13:54.139
No man likes another man
slipping his lady a lance, mate.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.180
Oh, fuck me. A note from the Queen?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.460
Compliments
of Commissioner Merv Wood.

14:02.495 --> 14:04.580
Best wishes for a speedy recovery.

14:04.615 --> 14:06.740
That's nice of the man.
He sent something else too.

14:06.775 --> 14:10.380
Commissioner wants to know
if anyone here's been a bad boy.

14:10.415 --> 14:12.900
Anybody got a truncheon tucked away?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.500
I got nothing to hide, love.

14:14.535 --> 14:18.780
<b>d Barbarella,
I got news for you... d</b>

14:18.815 --> 14:21.340
Oh!

14:21.375 --> 14:24.980
<b>d I know all about
the things you do... d</b>

14:25.015 --> 14:26.540
Watch the wound, love.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.220
Someone shoot me in the head.

14:28.255 --> 14:31.780
I'll come down soon. Kisses for all.

14:31.815 --> 14:33.736
'Bye.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.620
You gotta tell her about us, Bobby.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.099
Before she finds out.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.620
Oh, you look tired.

14:45.655 --> 14:48.340
Did you get your business
in London sorted?

14:48.375 --> 14:50.020
Oh, a few loose ends.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.011
I could murder a glass of plonk.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.020
I got some osso buco too.

14:55.055 --> 14:57.220
Temptress.

14:57.255 --> 14:58.733
Mmm.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.060
Er, not bad. How's your lot?

15:19.095 --> 15:21.620
Doesn't time fly.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.537
Yeah, yeah, I do need another one.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.660
Yes, I do know what I'm doing.

15:30.695 --> 15:33.940
Look, you just make sure
whoever you find

15:33.975 --> 15:37.455
knows what he's fucking doing,
will you?

15:48.660 --> 15:51.500
Honey, I've got fistfuls of cash
and bags full of coke,

15:51.535 --> 15:53.660
if we both went back to my place...

15:53.695 --> 15:56.580
Hey, Aussie Bob!
Let me buy you a drink, mate.

15:56.615 --> 15:58.580
What's wrong?
Bob.

15:58.615 --> 16:00.980
This is the bloke
I was telling you about.

16:01.015 --> 16:03.733
Chris Flannery, Aussie Bob.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.900
Frankie tells me you're a shooter.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.580
Yeah, I'm only
the best fucking shooter

16:10.615 --> 16:12.460
to come out of Victoria
since Ned Kelly.

16:12.495 --> 16:13.973
How many you done?

16:15.940 --> 16:17.419
What's the job?

16:22.140 --> 16:25.060
You get her from home,
you do the deed.

16:25.095 --> 16:27.740
And make sure she's never

16:27.775 --> 16:30.860
and I mean NEVER,
as in NOT EVER, found.

16:30.895 --> 16:34.340
20 grand. 5 grand deposit.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.260
I want it done nice and clean.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.900
Of course.

16:37.935 --> 16:39.780
I don't want her to know
what's coming.

16:39.815 --> 16:41.860
I don't want her to suffer.

16:41.895 --> 16:43.737
Fuck, mate,
you want the job done or not?

16:48.060 --> 16:50.220
It's just...

16:50.255 --> 16:52.097
...she's a special case.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.256
Me mum says everyone's special, Bob.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.819
JACQUl: There are moments

17:08.855 --> 17:11.253
when our survival instinct
takes over our senses.

17:16.940 --> 17:18.780
Some of us go into lockdown,

17:18.815 --> 17:21.817
trying to make ourselves
as small a target as possible.

17:23.660 --> 17:27.096
While others try to clean up the mess
they've made and only make it worse.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.458
And we never know which strategy
is right for which moment.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.780
Oh, good morning, miss.
How are you?

17:58.815 --> 18:00.540
I've got your aspid... itra here.

18:00.575 --> 18:02.220
She's a beauty, isn't she?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.980
I didn't order a fern.

18:04.015 --> 18:06.860
Oh, this is 67 Winslow, isn't it?

18:06.895 --> 18:08.820
No.
Oh.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.740
You couldn't show me
the right way, could you?

18:10.775 --> 18:12.740
I've been up and down this street
so many times.

18:12.775 --> 18:15.220
I can't see anything.
It's all these trees, you know?

18:15.255 --> 18:18.300
It's, um, second or third left
as you go towards the harbour.

18:18.335 --> 18:20.700
The harbour. Oh, is the harbour...
Which way is that?

18:20.735 --> 18:22.300
It's just down there.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.820
Oh, yeah.

18:23.855 --> 18:26.095
I can see the water now.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.013
Allison!

18:38.100 --> 18:39.980
Thanks for your help, miss.

18:40.015 --> 18:41.460
You're an early riser.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.940
Who's this? Your gardener?

18:42.975 --> 18:44.453
In you go, boys.

It was in the fur coat.

19:39.415 --> 19:40.900
What's this I hear

19:40.935 --> 19:43.180
about Marty's latest consignment
being cut to shite?

19:43.215 --> 19:45.820
He got ripped off in Thailand.

19:45.855 --> 19:48.860
The slimy Chink fuckers drove him
to the pick-up point in the jungle,

19:48.895 --> 19:50.820
they took his money,
they pulled guns on him

19:50.855 --> 19:52.380
and then they fucked off.

19:52.415 --> 19:55.940
It took him till four the next morning
to walk back to Bangkok.

19:55.975 --> 19:58.534
And all he had left
was a little one k sample.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.615
He feels really bad
about it, Tel. He does.

20:03.860 --> 20:06.613
70% of what he sent over was sugar.

20:07.660 --> 20:09.020
Sugar.

20:09.055 --> 20:11.700
70%. He's totally fucked
my reputation.

20:11.735 --> 20:14.620
No-one's gonna buy off me when
the quality product I promised them

20:14.655 --> 20:16.500
is Marty Johnstone's
fucking pube shavings.

20:16.535 --> 20:17.980
I told him that.

20:18.015 --> 20:20.420
Terry, I told him
not to go to Thailand.

20:20.455 --> 20:22.300
But he's fucked off
all our regular suppliers.

20:22.335 --> 20:25.180
He's burnt all his bridges.
You know what Marty's like.

20:25.215 --> 20:27.011
You could do a better job than him.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.060
Well, I don't know about that.

20:30.095 --> 20:32.900
I do know I've got
a couple of ideas,

20:32.935 --> 20:35.300
how we might help run things
a bit smoother.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.733
Well, I'd like to hear them.

20:39.340 --> 20:41.180
Let's go to the boardroom, eh?

20:41.215 --> 20:42.340
Oh.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.620
You're saying
it's the... er, it's the presses.

20:44.655 --> 20:46.620
Yeah, well, I think with,
like, a second press...

20:46.655 --> 20:48.100
Andy fucking Maher.

20:48.135 --> 20:50.620
And then with a second press,
we can double our output.

20:50.655 --> 20:53.300
Sounds great, mate.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.260
I can see you running
the Singapore end.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.260
Aye.

20:56.295 --> 20:57.740
Thank you very much.

20:57.775 --> 20:59.220
You could be Mr Asia.

20:59.255 --> 21:01.740
I don't know what our Marty
would say about that.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.540
Yeah... well,
you'd have to kill him, of course.

21:09.815 --> 21:11.340
Yeah, right.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.053
This is business, Andy.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.420
We have to restore confidence
in our product.

21:26.455 --> 21:27.933
And our management.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.300
Terry.

21:31.335 --> 21:32.980
He's my best friend.
He's your friend.

21:33.015 --> 21:34.820
Yeah, I can't kill a mate.
He's your friend.

21:34.855 --> 21:37.340
Friends look out for each other.
Friends don't crap on each other.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.780
Marty craps on you. He craps on me.

21:39.815 --> 21:41.540
And he looks out for himself,

21:41.575 --> 21:43.980
no-one else.

21:44.015 --> 21:45.460
But we've known each other
for years.

21:45.495 --> 21:47.340
What's he done for you
in that time?

21:47.375 --> 21:49.060
Has he once rung me and said,

21:49.095 --> 21:52.220
"See what you can do for Andy.
He's a good bloke"?

21:52.255 --> 21:56.736
Andy, I'm offering you a chance
to be my major broker in Asia.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.739
Yes or no?

22:02.260 --> 22:05.140
He's on his way here
on a plane right now, OK?

22:05.175 --> 22:09.060
I need to talk to him, see if we can
sort something out, OK?

22:09.095 --> 22:10.493
Sure.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.452
You do
whatever you think's best.

22:22.260 --> 22:24.940
Bob, if you're gonna hang around
like a bad smell,

22:24.975 --> 22:26.498
make yourself useful.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.140
Is this her, is it, Dad?

22:29.175 --> 22:30.700
Oh, hello, love.

22:30.735 --> 22:32.220
Nice to meet you, homewrecker.

22:32.255 --> 22:34.620
How long did you think
you were gonna get away with this?

22:34.655 --> 22:36.900
Does Mum know you're here?
Mum knows everything.

22:36.935 --> 22:38.900
Jesus, how could you
do this to her, Dad?

22:38.935 --> 22:41.380
Making nooky with this
little jumped-up waitress skank.

22:41.415 --> 22:42.980
Oh, how dare you!

22:43.015 --> 22:44.540
Best leave this to me, OK?

22:44.575 --> 22:46.460
I will dare what I want,
you gold-digging bitch!

22:46.495 --> 22:48.980
Oh, classy. No wonder he can't wait to
get away from you!

22:49.015 --> 22:50.020
Oh!

22:50.055 --> 22:51.580
Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

22:51.615 --> 22:53.180
That's...
Get off!

22:53.215 --> 22:54.660
That's enough!

24:05.700 --> 24:07.380
Terrence James Sinclair

24:07.415 --> 24:09.220
felt the weight
of his past slipping away.

24:09.255 --> 24:12.100
He was one of the leading
watercolourists of his time.

24:12.135 --> 24:14.694
What are you doing?
I have to go out.

24:22.209 --> 24:24.245
Why did you ask me to come here?

24:25.289 --> 24:26.769
What?

24:26.804 --> 24:28.889
Why did you ask me to move
from New Zealand?

24:28.924 --> 24:31.169
Was it for the sex?

24:31.204 --> 24:33.609
I thought you wanted to be here.
I do wanna be here.

24:33.644 --> 24:35.600
I'm asking why you want me here.

24:36.649 --> 24:40.169
We're gonna start
a new life together.

24:40.204 --> 24:42.089
I've said this before.

24:42.124 --> 24:44.009
You said all sorts of things, Terry.

24:44.044 --> 24:46.762
You've never said that you loved me.

24:49.169 --> 24:51.046
I won't be late.

25:31.449 --> 25:33.049
Thank you, Andy.

25:33.084 --> 25:36.529
I hear you've been
the Great White Hunter in the jungle.

25:36.564 --> 25:38.569
What can I say, Terry?

25:38.604 --> 25:41.003
You know me. Always a risk-taker.

25:43.049 --> 25:44.649
Remember when we first met?

25:44.684 --> 25:48.089
Intercontinental Hotel, Auckland city.

25:48.124 --> 25:49.969
August, '74.

25:50.004 --> 25:52.089
You waltzed in
in your three-piece suit,

25:52.124 --> 25:54.249
flower in your buttonhole,
doffing your hat.

25:56.769 --> 25:58.369
Yeah.

25:58.404 --> 26:00.246
Mr Asia.

26:02.369 --> 26:05.406
Sometimes I feel like
you're stealing my life, you prick.

26:07.129 --> 26:10.249
I'm picking up
very aggressive vibrations.

26:10.284 --> 26:12.489
Who knows what goes on
inside Terry's head?

26:12.524 --> 26:14.329
He gives me the willies. Always has.

26:14.364 --> 26:17.089
Let's see him cope with loony Chinks
pointing AK-47 s at his head.

26:17.124 --> 26:19.289
He doesn't appreciate you, Marty.

26:19.324 --> 26:22.486
Doesn't appreciate what you've done
for the organisation.

26:24.089 --> 26:25.849
I mean, you should piss him off.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.129
There must be loads
of other people you could deal to.

26:28.164 --> 26:29.609
My mates, for one.

26:29.644 --> 26:31.409
The ones in Glasgow?
Aye.

26:31.444 --> 26:34.129
They've been on at me for years
about dealing smack to them.

26:34.164 --> 26:36.049
The market is massive up there.

26:36.084 --> 26:38.249
This is a chance for you and me.

26:38.284 --> 26:40.489
We set up
our own distribution network,

26:40.524 --> 26:42.089
we deliver straight to Scotland,

26:42.124 --> 26:44.169
and Terry Clark can go fuck himself.

26:44.204 --> 26:47.929
Hmm. These mates of yours -
good blokes?

26:47.964 --> 26:49.449
Aye.

26:49.484 --> 26:50.969
Let's get the ball rolling.

26:51.004 --> 26:54.120
We could pick up Jamie now
and head up tonight.

26:57.329 --> 26:58.809
I'm off.

26:58.844 --> 27:00.845
Like a piece of cheese.

27:01.889 --> 27:03.409
So I'll call you, yeah?

27:03.444 --> 27:05.969
Sure. You off too, mate?

27:06.004 --> 27:07.880
Aye. You don't mind, do you?

27:08.929 --> 27:10.408
You do whatever you think's best.

27:16.689 --> 27:18.529
Is anyone else
busting for a piss?

27:18.564 --> 27:20.289
Fucking oath. Where are we?

27:20.324 --> 27:22.249
Somewhere in Lancashire, I think.

27:22.284 --> 27:24.689
Pull over then, eh?
Sure.

27:24.724 --> 27:26.645
Might join you, actually.

27:33.369 --> 27:35.289
So what do you do, Jamie?

27:35.324 --> 27:37.409
Aye, you know,
bit of this, bit of that.

27:37.444 --> 27:39.769
Used to be in the Scots Guards.

27:39.804 --> 27:41.529
Useful man to have around, eh?

27:41.564 --> 27:42.529
Aye.

27:42.564 --> 27:44.249
Hey, how's your dad's arthritis?

27:44.284 --> 27:45.849
It's not too bad.

27:45.884 --> 27:47.329
We should visit him.

27:47.364 --> 27:50.241
I can drink all his Scotch
and let him beat me at backgammon.

28:17.769 --> 28:19.249
Cut off the hands?

28:19.284 --> 28:21.209
Smashed in the teeth?

28:21.244 --> 28:22.649
Aye.

28:22.684 --> 28:24.367
He won't be found?

28:25.529 --> 28:27.009
Are you sure?

28:27.044 --> 28:28.609
No body, no case, remember.

28:28.644 --> 28:30.042
He won't be found.

28:37.409 --> 28:39.400
Well done, mate. It's a good one.

28:59.449 --> 29:01.489
The bail's set at $5,000.

29:01.524 --> 29:03.529
How long till court?

29:03.564 --> 29:05.440
She's been remanded till November 2.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.808
What's she said?

29:09.849 --> 29:11.849
Nothing.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.809
What, she didn't give up anything?

29:13.844 --> 29:15.489
Didn't say a word, apparently.

29:15.524 --> 29:17.809
No comment queen.

29:17.844 --> 29:20.409
Looks like a China doll,
but she's a toughie.

29:20.444 --> 29:23.799
Course, she'll probably
spill her guts next time.

29:26.209 --> 29:27.801
There won't be a next time.

29:32.009 --> 29:33.681
Drop her round to my joint.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.729
Brian Alexander's represented
a dozen people on heroin charges.

29:38.764 --> 29:40.209
Three had connections
to biker gangs,

29:40.244 --> 29:41.889
eight had small amounts -
personal use stuff.

29:41.924 --> 29:45.809
And what about the last bloke?
She's a woman - Joyce Allez.

29:45.844 --> 29:47.609
Arrested last month

29:47.644 --> 29:51.769
arriving from Singapore with
3.5 kilos in a false-bottom suitcase.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.849
She's worked in massage
parlours prior to this.

29:53.884 --> 29:56.129
Only lawyer she's ever had
has been legal aid.

29:56.164 --> 29:58.769
Yet now, of all the solicitors' offices
in all the world,

29:58.804 --> 30:00.289
she calls Brian Alexander's.

30:00.324 --> 30:02.129
Is she facing trial?
Yeah.

30:02.164 --> 30:04.769
Get the prosecution brief,
her record of interview,

30:04.804 --> 30:07.237
and find if there's
any connection to Clark.

30:15.009 --> 30:16.442
Hello?

30:23.529 --> 30:24.962
Bob?

30:38.529 --> 30:40.009
Bob?

30:41.324 --> 30:42.802
G'day, love.

30:44.569 --> 30:46.241
I've got something for you.

30:48.569 --> 30:50.400
Time to ship out, I reckon.

30:51.449 --> 30:53.329
Shape up and ship out.

30:53.364 --> 30:57.329
Though in my case
there'd be no 'shape up'.

30:57.364 --> 30:59.399
Or 'ship out'.

31:01.249 --> 31:02.729
I can go?

31:02.764 --> 31:04.321
Go away?

31:06.569 --> 31:08.489
But wh-what about the business?

31:08.524 --> 31:10.764
I'll sort something.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.724
No... no. No need for waterworks.

31:16.889 --> 31:19.089
Terry sent a man to the house.

31:19.124 --> 31:20.849
To kill me!

31:20.884 --> 31:23.289
Oh, now, now, now.
Y- you're just het up.

31:23.324 --> 31:27.569
He had some silly story
about delivering a fern.

31:27.604 --> 31:29.369
He was reaching for a gun!

31:29.404 --> 31:31.963
Oh... but...
No, probably just a pair of secateurs.

31:33.009 --> 31:36.529
Look, you're a good person, Ally.

31:36.564 --> 31:39.769
You go get yourself a new life.

31:39.804 --> 31:42.729
Forget about the whole bung lot,

31:42.764 --> 31:44.879
Terry and me included.

31:55.129 --> 31:57.769
No way, Bob.

31:57.804 --> 32:00.569
What do you mean, "No way"?
I want my deposit back.

32:00.604 --> 32:02.329
Deposit is non-refundable.

32:02.364 --> 32:04.849
Listen, you greedy little piece of...

32:04.884 --> 32:08.569
No, you listen, Bob!

32:08.604 --> 32:11.209
You employed
my professional services, right?!

32:11.244 --> 32:13.169
You fucking hassle me again

32:13.204 --> 32:15.929
and I will shove this ladle
so far up your tubby arse

32:15.964 --> 32:17.840
you're gonna have to
pull it out your throat.

32:19.569 --> 32:21.649
Now, why'd you cancel, Bob?

32:21.684 --> 32:24.609
Because you're such a professional,

32:24.644 --> 32:28.807
you deserve five grand
for doing sweet fuck-all.

32:38.649 --> 32:40.605
Karen?
I'm in here.

32:48.249 --> 32:49.809
What's that smell?

32:49.844 --> 32:51.447
It's beef burgundy.

32:52.489 --> 32:55.209
Hey, get dressed.

33:07.849 --> 33:09.409
Set.

33:09.444 --> 33:10.929
Oh!

33:10.964 --> 33:12.929
<b>d It's a matter of trust

33:12.964 --> 33:14.569
<b>d You got me wishing... d

33:14.604 --> 33:16.049
Off?

33:16.084 --> 33:17.649
Yes. Yes! I'm gonna faint.

33:17.684 --> 33:19.129
Oh, God, I'm gonna faint. Oh!

33:19.164 --> 33:22.289

33:47.084 --> 33:50.041
JACQUl: For once, the piles of cash
in Terry's house were legal.

33:51.729 --> 33:54.529
On that soon-to-be-famous
autumn evening at Ladbrokes,

33:54.564 --> 33:57.889
Karen Soich won L18,000
playing blackjack.

33:57.924 --> 33:59.489
Thanks for taking me out.

33:59.524 --> 34:03.004
You make me better
than I've ever felt before.

34:05.049 --> 34:07.404
You make me everything I want to be.

34:10.129 --> 34:11.608
Who do you wanna be?

34:13.009 --> 34:14.567
Your best friend.

34:16.369 --> 34:17.802
Your lover.

34:20.168 --> 34:21.601
Your husband.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.400
I love you.

34:33.768 --> 34:35.407
I love you.

35:04.129 --> 35:05.649
Grotto restaurant.

35:05.684 --> 35:07.609
It's me.
Have you done it yet?

35:07.644 --> 35:09.009
Done what?

35:09.044 --> 35:10.489
Allison.

35:10.524 --> 35:12.889
Oh, not... not quite.
These things take a bit of setting up.

35:12.924 --> 35:14.689
Thank God. Don't do it.

35:14.724 --> 35:17.049
Pardon?
She's been true to us.

35:17.084 --> 35:19.449
We should do the right thing by her.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.769
No worries, mate.

35:21.804 --> 35:23.969
If that's the way you feel.

35:24.004 --> 35:25.449
It is.

35:25.484 --> 35:27.769
How'd you know I'd be here, anyway?

35:27.804 --> 35:30.049
You're my mate, Bob.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.529
I know you inside out.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.009
Oh, yeah.

35:33.044 --> 35:35.329
You can read me like a bloody book.

36:00.529 --> 36:02.569
You did say it would have to be
an issue

36:02.604 --> 36:04.169
before the Prime Minister would act.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.169
So you leaked the Wilson tapes
to the press?

36:06.204 --> 36:07.969
Jesus, Joe.

36:08.004 --> 36:09.969
We need to maintain
the highest ethical standards.

36:10.004 --> 36:13.089
Well, like I said, Dave,
you can be too honest.

36:13.124 --> 36:14.929
Excuse me.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.729
We've got the prosecution brief
on Joyce Allez.

36:17.764 --> 36:19.649
According to her record of interview,

36:19.684 --> 36:22.009
she was driven to the airport
for her flight to Singapore

36:22.044 --> 36:23.609
by two other women -

36:23.644 --> 36:25.769
Kay Reynolds and Allison Dine.

36:25.804 --> 36:28.809
Dine was also arrested
for possession the other day.

36:28.844 --> 36:31.489
Guess who her choice
of solicitor was.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.969
Brian Alexander.

36:33.004 --> 36:35.249
The address she gave
is a flash pad in Lane Cove.

36:35.284 --> 36:36.809
We've already done
a full title search.

36:36.844 --> 36:39.329
Who owns it?
Terry Clark.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.289
Yes!

36:41.324 --> 36:43.889
Phew!

36:43.924 --> 36:45.322
Eh?!

37:00.209 --> 37:02.929
She's heading for International
Departures. Warwick's following.

37:02.964 --> 37:04.409
We have to stop her.

37:04.444 --> 37:06.529
We lose her,
we lose any direct link with Clark.

37:06.564 --> 37:09.009
If we pull her in,
we let everyone in the organisation

37:09.044 --> 37:10.569
know we're onto them,
including Clark.

37:10.604 --> 37:13.729
Jesus, Dave! You ever arrest anybody?

37:13.764 --> 37:16.729
If she's going to a country we've got
extradition arrangements with,

37:16.764 --> 37:18.162
it's worth the risk.

37:19.449 --> 37:20.929
American Airlines to L.A.

37:20.964 --> 37:22.929
She's travelling under the name
Mary Jackson.

37:22.964 --> 37:25.609
JACQUl: They let Allison
leave the country

37:25.644 --> 37:27.609
even though she was breaking bail.

37:27.644 --> 37:29.249
For one thing,

37:29.284 --> 37:32.209
Dave Priest said his mates in the FBI
would keep track of her

37:32.244 --> 37:33.809
if he asked them nicely.

37:33.844 --> 37:35.649
And as far as they knew,

37:35.684 --> 37:38.129
Allison was just another
of Clark's female couriers.

37:38.164 --> 37:40.409
Just one of a whole bunch
of underlings.

37:40.444 --> 37:41.842
No-one special.

37:47.129 --> 37:50.209
Hey, baby. Come to Papa.

37:50.244 --> 37:54.529
Oh, look at the tight muff
on that one, eh?

37:54.564 --> 37:56.569
I like a tight muff.

37:56.604 --> 38:02.049
A connoisseur of fine wines too,
no doubt, Johannes.

38:02.084 --> 38:03.529
Yeah.

38:03.564 --> 38:07.841
Word is that nervy son-in-law
of yours... Freeman.

38:08.889 --> 38:10.249
Mick?

38:10.284 --> 38:14.169
Well, I wouldn't wanna put
the little poofter in it,

38:14.204 --> 38:15.769
but, you know...

38:15.804 --> 38:19.489
I knew it had the hallmarks
of a pudding-head like him.

38:19.524 --> 38:21.529
What do you mean?

38:21.564 --> 38:25.009
You're shooting a bloke
at point-blank range in the head

38:25.044 --> 38:26.929
and you don't manage to kill him?

38:26.964 --> 38:28.849
Oh, that doesn't mean shit, Trimbole.

38:28.884 --> 38:33.729
Mick, he was, er, he was working
under difficult circumstances.

38:33.764 --> 38:35.209
Like what?

38:35.244 --> 38:36.849
Cyclone Tracy?

38:36.884 --> 38:40.209
Mick Hurley's your man.
That's the big word.

38:40.244 --> 38:44.889
Apparently, er,
the reason he only got one shot off

38:44.924 --> 38:47.929
was you swearing at him
and failing to fall over.

38:47.964 --> 38:50.649
Got that from Mick, did you?

38:50.684 --> 38:53.609
No, his father-in-law,
that Muller bloke.

38:53.644 --> 38:56.726
I don't think there's much
family feeling there.

39:00.769 --> 39:02.202
No.

39:04.369 --> 39:06.087
Perhaps not.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.089
Next time, sweetie,
I want a longer fucking head job.

39:14.124 --> 39:16.000
Stingy bitch.

39:34.209 --> 39:36.089
If you're gonna kill someone, matey,

39:36.124 --> 39:37.689
get it right!

39:52.689 --> 39:54.849
I should've done it, Lennie.

39:54.884 --> 39:56.529
Yeah, that would've been smart.

39:56.564 --> 39:58.009
I'd have been careful.

39:58.044 --> 39:59.969
I can handle myself.

40:00.004 --> 40:03.249
So, I do you a favour

40:03.284 --> 40:05.849
and all the thanks I get
is you measuring your dick.

40:05.884 --> 40:08.807
All I'm saying is I am capable
of cleaning up me own shit.

40:10.249 --> 40:11.728
Three aces.

40:13.449 --> 40:16.089
Full house. Queen high.

40:18.004 --> 40:20.244
Go again?
Yeah.

40:21.449 --> 40:22.928
By the way...

40:23.969 --> 40:25.402
...thanks.

40:27.169 --> 40:28.921
No worries, mate.

40:30.089 --> 40:32.129
Johannes Muller.
Johannes Muller.

40:40.244 --> 40:47.524

<b>d Oh!</b>

41:10.164 --> 41:15.169

But all our sins
will surface eventually.

41:50.089 --> 41:51.969
Fuckin' hell, man!
Come on, lad.

41:52.004 --> 41:53.925
Fuckin' hell!
Gotta get him out of here!

41:55.569 --> 41:57.169
Andy. Andy!

41:57.204 --> 41:58.769
Come on, lad.

42:00.404 --> 42:02.009
No! Fucking hell.

42:02.044 --> 42:03.442
Fuck.

42:06.164 --> 42:08.449
Oh! Fuckin' hell, man!

42:08.484 --> 42:10.129
Fuckin' hell!

42:10.164 --> 42:12.049

42:12.084 --> 42:13.969
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

42:14.004 --> 42:17.049
Well, he's not dead!
Of course he's fucking dead!

42:17.084 --> 42:18.689
Andy, come on, lad!

42:18.724 --> 42:20.329
He's fucking dead, man.
Now, come on!
