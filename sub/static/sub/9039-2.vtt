00:04.567 --> 00:06.733
- MORNING, DEB.
HERE'S YOUR PAPER.

00:06.733 --> 00:08.133
- THANKS, ROBERT.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.200
- JUST STOPPED BY MOM AND DAD'S
FOR SOME COFFEE,

00:10.200 --> 00:13.733
BUT I COULDN'T TAKE
ALL THE...MOM AND DAD.

00:16.633 --> 00:18.267
- HERE.
YOU CAN HAVE RAY'S.

00:18.267 --> 00:20.333
- OH. THANKS.

00:20.333 --> 00:23.233
THERE'S A VIBE OVER THERE
THAT GIVES ME--

00:23.233 --> 00:24.967
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT--

00:24.967 --> 00:27.400
SEARING ABDOMINAL CRAMPS.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.633
- WHY DO YOU KEEP
GOING OVER THERE?

00:31.633 --> 00:32.633
- GOOD COFFEE.

00:34.633 --> 00:35.600
- HOW'S THIS, HUH?

00:37.233 --> 00:40.567
- WELL, WHEN YOU--WHEN YOU
FACTOR IN THE VIBE HERE,

00:40.567 --> 00:42.533
THE--THE WHOLE PACKAGE
IS GOOD.

00:42.533 --> 00:43.700
HEY, RAY.

00:43.700 --> 00:44.733
- ROBERT.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.633
OUT OF MILK.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.200
YOU DID THAT
ON PURPOSE.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.200
- YOU WANTED MILK.

01:22.067 --> 01:24.400
[door opens and closes]

01:24.400 --> 01:28.100
- I'VE GOT TO BUY MYSELF
A COFFEEMAKER.

01:37.567 --> 01:38.600
- HEY.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.400
- HEY.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.433
RAYMOND, LOOK AT YOU.

01:42.433 --> 01:43.400
- WHAT?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.733
- YOU'VE GOT MILK SPOTS.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.667
- HOW CAN YOU TELL IT'S MILK
FROM OVER THERE?

01:49.667 --> 01:51.733
- IT'S WHAT I DO.

01:54.067 --> 01:56.633
WHAT, DID ONE OF THE CHILDREN
GET YOU?

01:56.633 --> 01:58.800
- NO, DEBRA.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.400
- WELL, OF COURSE.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.333
IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WAY
AROUND A KITCHEN,

02:02.333 --> 02:05.133
THESE THINGS
ARE BOUND TO HAPPEN.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.667
OH, SIT DOWN.
EAT.

02:08.067 --> 02:10.733
- YOU DON'T CLEAN UP
MY SPOTS.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.700
- YOUR SPOTS?

02:13.700 --> 02:15.633
I COULD SQUEEZE OUT YOUR SHIRT
AND MAKE SOUP.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.067
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GIVE ME THIS SHIRT.

02:23.067 --> 02:24.267
- NO, NO,
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK, MA.

02:24.267 --> 02:25.600
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.000
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW DEBRA

02:27.000 --> 02:29.400
CAN LET YOU GO
TO WORK LIKE THAT.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.700
- SHE DOESN'T CARE.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.400
- WHAT'S THAT, DEAR?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.300
- NO. NOTHIN', NOTHIN'.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.733
- WHAT?

02:38.700 --> 02:42.800
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.600
PLEASE TALK TO ME.

02:47.433 --> 02:52.000
- NOTHIN'. NOTHIN'.
IT'S JUST...UNNHH.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.533
- WHAT? WHAT?

02:53.533 --> 02:55.467
- CAN'T YOU READ THE SIGNS?

02:55.467 --> 02:58.967
"NOTHIN'. IT'S JUST...
NUHHH."

02:58.967 --> 03:00.733
HE'S MARRIED.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.200
- OH.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.200
WHAT DID SHE DO?

03:09.900 --> 03:11.933
- SO...TROUBLE IN PARADISE?

03:11.933 --> 03:13.600
- OH, NO.
IT'S JUST THAT...

03:13.600 --> 03:16.200
YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO HEAR ME COMPLAIN ABOUT RAY?

03:23.267 --> 03:26.267
- PERHAPS WE HAVEN'T MET.
I'M ROBERT BARONE.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.533
- NOTHIN'. SHE JUST...

03:29.533 --> 03:32.200
SHE WENT ALL NUTS
OVER A CAN OPENER.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
- CAN OPENER?

03:33.200 --> 03:35.100
- OH, POOR RAYMOND.

03:35.100 --> 03:39.233
NOTHING GOOD
COMES FROM A CAN.

03:39.233 --> 03:41.133
GO ON. GO AHEAD.
TELL ME.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.533
- NOTHIN'.

03:42.533 --> 03:44.467
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DID WRONG.

03:44.467 --> 03:48.167
I MEAN, I COME HOME
IN A GOOD MOOD, LIKE USUAL.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.367
- WELL, OF COURSE, DEAR.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.733
YOU WERE ALWAYS
A HAPPY CHILD.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.033
- YEAH.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.467
I KNOW. ANYWAY,
I'M WALKIN' IN...

03:55.467 --> 03:57.333
- HI, DADDY.
- HI, DADDY.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.233
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
- HI, DADDY.

03:59.233 --> 04:00.500
- [cheerfully]
HI!

04:00.500 --> 04:02.633
- UHH.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.500
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

04:17.400 --> 04:20.367
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:22.533 --> 04:24.567
- GREAT.
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

04:24.567 --> 04:26.200
- I HAVEN'T MADE YOU
ANYTHING YET, RAY.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.667
CAN YOU WAIT?

04:27.667 --> 04:28.900
- FINE.

04:28.900 --> 04:32.100
I'LL MAKE
MY OWN DINNER.

04:34.467 --> 04:37.433
[whistling]

04:41.767 --> 04:45.100
MMM, TUNA FISH.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.233
WHERE IS THAT CAN OPENER?

04:48.233 --> 04:50.033
- IT'S IN THE DRAWER.

04:50.033 --> 04:51.433
- WHAT?

04:51.433 --> 04:54.600
- THE CAN OPENER IS
IN THE UTENSIL DRAWER.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.367
- RIGHTIE-OH.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.333
AH.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.767
- YEAH, I BOUGHT
A NEW ONE.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.467
- OH. DID WE NEED
A NEW CAN OPENER?

05:05.467 --> 05:07.833
- IT'S BETTER.
OKAY?

05:07.833 --> 05:11.367
IT CUTS FROM THE SIDE
SO THERE'S NO SHARP EDGES.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.767
- HOW DOES
THIS THING WORK?

05:14.767 --> 05:17.067
- YOU PUT IT ON THE CAN.
YOU TWIST THE THING.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.700
YOU OPEN...THE CAN!

05:18.700 --> 05:19.567
[sighs]

05:19.567 --> 05:23.367
- GREAT.
A BETTER CAN OPENER.

05:23.367 --> 05:24.433
[laughs]

05:24.433 --> 05:28.567
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

05:28.567 --> 05:31.667
- WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOA!
[laughs]

05:31.667 --> 05:33.500
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

05:38.267 --> 05:40.367
- OH, USE A FORK.
GOD.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.433
- HMM?

05:45.533 --> 05:46.633
- OOP.

05:50.533 --> 05:53.933
- WAS--WAS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE OTHER CAN OPENER?

05:53.933 --> 05:56.867
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THIS CAN OPENER.

05:56.867 --> 05:59.267
- [chuckling]
NO, NOTHING'S WRONG, HONEY.

05:59.267 --> 06:01.967
I MEAN, I WOULD'VE PREFERRED
THE TUNA ON BREAD,

06:01.967 --> 06:04.333
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S...

06:04.333 --> 06:07.767
IT'S JUST AS DELICIOUS
RIGHT OUT OF THE SINK.

06:07.767 --> 06:11.067
[laughing]

06:12.367 --> 06:14.767
- THIS IS THE CAN OPENER
I BOUGHT, OKAY, RAY?

06:14.767 --> 06:16.333
BECAUSE IT'S BETTER.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.533
IT'S NOT STUPID,
AND I'M NOT STUPID!

06:22.900 --> 06:26.033
- WHAT'D I SAY?

06:27.133 --> 06:29.667
AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.767
- IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES
HE'S SUCH A JERK!

06:35.767 --> 06:38.567
- GIVEN. DETAILS?

06:38.567 --> 06:40.833
- LAST NIGHT, OKAY?
THE KIDS ARE A MESS.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.767
I'M TRYIN' TO HOLD
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

06:42.767 --> 06:46.933
- YOU'RE THE GLUE, DEBRA.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

06:46.933 --> 06:49.200
- ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,
HE COMES HOME...

06:49.200 --> 06:50.933
[kids all shouting]

06:50.933 --> 06:53.767
- OH, PLEASE, COME ON.

06:53.767 --> 06:55.167
- I'M GONNA RUN AWAY.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.900
- NO! DON'T RUN AWAY.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.833
MOMMY WOULD MISS YOU
SO MUCH.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.200
YES, SHE WOULD.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.967
OH, COME ON.
SIT, SIT, SIT. LET'S EAT.

07:01.967 --> 07:03.267
HEY, DADDY'S HOME.
HI, RAY.

07:03.267 --> 07:05.167
- YEAH.
- HI, DADDY.

07:07.167 --> 07:08.367
- [flatly]
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

07:08.367 --> 07:10.100
- OH, GOSH.
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT WAS--

07:10.100 --> 07:12.000
- GREAT.
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.900
- I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO MAKE YOU ANYTHING YET, RAY.

07:14.900 --> 07:15.900
IF YOU COULD JUST WAIT.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.300
- [grouchily]
FINE.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.000
MAKE MY OWN DINNER.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.733
AGAIN.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.767
MMM! TUNA FISH.

07:32.767 --> 07:36.500
SON OF A--WELL,
WHERE'S THE CAN OPENER?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.400
- UH, IT'S IN THE DRAWER.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.633
- WHAT?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.533
- THE CAN OPENER'S
IN THE UTENSIL DRAWER.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.433
- RIGHT.

07:45.733 --> 07:49.100
[loud rattling]

07:53.467 --> 07:54.333
- HERE.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.667
SEE?
I BOUGHT A NEW ONE.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.333
- [irritated] DID WE NEED
A NEW CAN OPENER?

07:59.333 --> 08:01.067
- IT'S BETTER;
IT CUTS THE CAN FROM THE SIDE

08:01.067 --> 08:02.633
SO THERE'S
NO SHARP EDGES.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.000
- HOW DOES
THIS THING WORK?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.433
- LOOK.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.633
SEE? YOU JUST
PUT IT ON THE CAN.

08:10.633 --> 08:13.167
YOU TWIST THE THING,
AND IT OPENS THE CAN.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.233
- MMM.
- HUH?

08:14.233 --> 08:16.133
- GREAT,
A BETTER CAN OPENER.

08:16.133 --> 08:18.500
[chuckles]
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.133
NOTHING!

08:25.033 --> 08:28.167
OH, GREAT.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

08:28.167 --> 08:32.000
OH, MY GOD!
TUNA JUICE! OH, MY GOD!

08:35.700 --> 08:36.700
- HERE.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.500
SWEETIE, USE A FORK.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.867
- WAS THERE SOMETHIN' WRONG
WITH THE OLD CAN OPENER?

08:44.867 --> 08:47.100
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THIS CAN OPENER.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.467
- OH, NO.
NOTHING'S WRONG, HONEY.

08:49.467 --> 08:51.733
I MEAN, I WOULD'VE
PREFERRED THE TUNA ON BREAD,

08:51.733 --> 08:55.067
BUT IT'S JUST AS DELICIOUS
RIGHT OUT OF THE SINK.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.900
- NO, RAY, THIS IS
THE CAN OPENER I BOUGHT

09:01.900 --> 09:03.433
BECAUSE...IT WAS BETTER.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.167
I MEAN, IT'S NOT STUPID,

09:05.167 --> 09:09.433
AND--AND I'M NOT...STUPID.

09:15.067 --> 09:18.333
- WHAT'D I SAY?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.733
- THAT BASTARD.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.933
- I DON'T KNOW; ONE--ONE LITTLE
COMMENT ABOUT A CAN OPENER,

09:29.933 --> 09:32.267
AND...SHE FREAKS OUT,

09:32.267 --> 09:34.667
LIKE THE TIME
I BET THE KIDS

09:34.667 --> 09:38.300
THEY COULDN'T HIT
THE CEILING FAN WITH A PLUM.

09:41.667 --> 09:45.567
- RAY, I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE SECRET TO MARITAL BLISS.

09:45.567 --> 09:50.433
- AFTER YOU GIVE IT TO HIM,
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME IN ON IT?

09:50.433 --> 09:54.167
- YOU SEE, SON, WHEN YOUR MOTHER
GOT PREGNANT WITH ROBERT,

09:54.167 --> 09:57.433
THE HORMONES TURNED HER
INTO A NUT CASE.

09:57.433 --> 09:58.833
SHE'D CRY FOR NO REASON.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.633
TWO SECONDS LATER,
SHE'D WANT TO CUDDLE.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.267
SHE WAS, LIKE, DEMENTED.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.367
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:06.367 --> 10:09.100
- SURE, IT WAS.
YOU WERE ALWAYS GRABBIN' AT ME.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.000
- I WAS PREGNANT
WITH A 14-POUND BABY.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.567
I NEEDED HELP
GETTING UP.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.000
- NONETHELESS.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.900
DID IT BOTHER ME? NO.

10:21.900 --> 10:25.833
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GET UPSET
WITH A CRAZY PERSON.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.567
I DECIDED
FROM THAT DAY ON

10:27.567 --> 10:30.067
TO NEVER WASTE TIME TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOUR MOTHER.

10:30.067 --> 10:33.933
I JUST ACCEPT SHE'S INSANE.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.567
- I MUST BE.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.033
- YOU TWO ARE CRAZY IN LOVE.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.367
- OH, NO, NO.
RAYMOND, DON'T GO.

10:41.367 --> 10:45.967
WE WERE HAVING
SUCH A NICE TALK ABOUT DEBRA.

10:45.967 --> 10:48.400
I LOVE
THAT KIND OF TALK.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.167
- YEAH.
I KNOW YOU DO, MA.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.900
- JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF
SHE'S NUTS.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.067
SAVES TIME.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.567
- I'M NOT ONE
TO CHOOSE SIDES,

10:56.567 --> 10:59.533
BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE
AN EXCELLENT CAN OPENER.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.933
- OH, BOY.

11:27.933 --> 11:31.567
I THINK I NEED
SOME PEPTO.

11:32.967 --> 11:33.967
MAY I?

11:33.967 --> 11:35.667
- SURE.
GO AHEAD.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.267
- [burps]

11:47.700 --> 11:48.700
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

11:48.700 --> 11:50.633
- CHANGING MY SHIRT.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.600
- SORRY I SPILLED MILK
ON YOUR SHIRT.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.767
- OH.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.133
IT'S OKAY.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.700
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE...

12:00.700 --> 12:01.933
YOU KNOW.

12:01.933 --> 12:04.000
- IT'S OKAY.
FORGET IT.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.100
- OKAY.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.267
ALL RIGHT, SO...
I'LL SEE YOU.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.267
SEE YOU LATER.

12:12.267 --> 12:14.067
- AREN'T YOU GONNA
KISS ME GOOD-BYE?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.300
- OH. YEAH.

12:17.833 --> 12:19.233
- YOU KNOW, RAY,

12:19.233 --> 12:20.900
I JUST WANT YOU
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

12:20.900 --> 12:23.467
WHY I WAS UPSET ABOUT
THE CAN OPENER LAST NIGHT.

12:23.467 --> 12:25.267
- OH, I UNDERSTAND.
I KNOW WHY.

12:25.267 --> 12:27.967
I DO. OKAY. SO...
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:27.967 --> 12:31.000
- I--I MEAN, YOU
REALLY...KNOW WHY?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.667
- SURE.
SURE, I KNOW.

12:32.667 --> 12:37.767
I...TOTALLY KNOW.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.167
- OKAY. THANKS.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.867
- OKAY. GOOD.

12:40.867 --> 12:42.833
SO SHOULD I BRING HOME A PIZZA
TONIGHT OR SOMETHIN'?

12:42.833 --> 12:45.000
- YEAH, SURE; IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT, THAT'D BE GREAT.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.133
- OKAY. GOOD, GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.667
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.600
- HELLO, DEARS.
- HI, MA. BYE, MA.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.767
- OH, RAYMOND,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE.

12:53.767 --> 12:57.367
I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT FIX EVERYTHING.

12:57.367 --> 12:58.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:58.367 --> 13:01.267
- EVERYTHING'S FINE, MA.

13:06.867 --> 13:09.033
- WHAT IS IT,
MARIE?

13:10.233 --> 13:11.467
WHAT IS IT?

13:11.467 --> 13:12.800
- IT'S--IT'S ONE
OF MY OLD ONES.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.367
IT'S THE KIND
THAT ACTUALLY WORKS.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.167
- RAY?

13:19.167 --> 13:21.033
- OHHH...

13:21.033 --> 13:22.633
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

13:22.633 --> 13:24.167
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.000
- WHAT IS THIS?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.300
- DON'T BE UPSET, DEAR.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.133
IT'S ONLY A CAN OPENER.

13:38.133 --> 13:39.600
- SO I'M THINKING

13:39.600 --> 13:42.500
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND, RAY,

13:42.500 --> 13:44.800
WHY I WAS UPSET.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.667
- AGAIN, I GOT NOTHIN'
TO DO WITH THIS.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.967
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE
BROUGHT THAT THING OVER HERE.

13:48.967 --> 13:51.167
- SO WHAT DID YOU DO, RAY,

13:51.167 --> 13:52.800
RUN ACROSS THE STREET
AND TELL YOUR MOM

13:52.800 --> 13:55.067
WHAT A HORRIBLE WOMAN
YOU'RE MARRIED TO?

13:55.067 --> 13:57.767
- RAYMOND NEVER
SAID "HORRIBLE."

13:59.800 --> 14:02.700
- WOULD YOU STOP?

14:02.700 --> 14:05.800
- MARIE, SUN'S UP,
PLATE'S EMPTY.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.867
WHERE ARE MY EGGS?

14:08.867 --> 14:10.400
- FRANK.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.333
- OH, YEAH.
THE CAN OPENER.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.067
IT'S NOT YOUR
FAULT, DEBRA.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.500
I UNDERSTAND
HORMONES.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.400
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU TELL THEM?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.233
- HORMONES WAS HIS THEORY.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.833
IT DID SOUND LIKE YOUR REACTION
TO THE CAN OPENER

14:22.833 --> 14:24.833
WAS A LITTLE...
DRAMATIC.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.333
- WOO-WOO-WOO.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.767
FRANK, I CAN
SEE AND HEAR YOU.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.700
- HUNHH!

14:36.700 --> 14:39.067
- YOU WERE COMPLETELY
OUT OF LINE LAST NIGHT.

14:39.067 --> 14:40.667
- I GOTTA GET TO WORK.
- HOW DARE YOU?

14:40.667 --> 14:42.200
NOT ONLY WERE YOU
COMPLETELY WRONG,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.433
BUT YOU MADE ME OUT
TO BE THE CRAZY ONE.

14:44.433 --> 14:46.400
- HEY, DEB,
I FINISHED THE PEPTO.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.200
IS THIS ABOUT ME?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.133
- NO, DEAR,
IT'S NOTHING.

14:57.133 --> 15:00.300
ALL I DID WAS BRING DEBRA
MY OLD CAN OPENER.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.200
- OH, RAY, JUST
USE THE NEW ONE.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.367
STOP BEING A JERK.

15:03.367 --> 15:04.867
- JERK? WHAT? WHAT?

15:04.867 --> 15:06.267
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT IT?

15:06.267 --> 15:07.600
- HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.267
- NOW, YOU STICK TO YOUR
GUNS, DEB, OKAY?

15:09.267 --> 15:10.367
RAYMOND'S A JERK.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.967
I KNOW THE WHOLE
STORY, JERK.

15:13.967 --> 15:15.600
ONE LITTLE DROP
OF FISH JUICE,

15:15.600 --> 15:19.600
AND YOU SQUEAL
LIKE A STUCK PIG.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.233
- YOU TOLD HIM THAT? HUH?
I DID NOT DO THAT.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.200
AND BY THE WAY,
THE WHOLE CAN DUMPED ON ME.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.167
- OH, IT WAS ONE DROP,
YOU BABY.

15:26.167 --> 15:29.100
- ONE DROP? IT WAS LIKE
I STUCK MY ARM UP A TUNA.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.500
- JERKBABY.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.967
- SHUT UP, HUH?!
WHAT--WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

15:39.967 --> 15:41.367
- I TOLD HIM THE TRUTH:

15:41.367 --> 15:43.133
THAT YOU COME HOME ALL,
"WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

15:43.133 --> 15:44.267
"OH, A CAN?

15:44.267 --> 15:46.833
"HOW...MAKE...
TUNA...OUT?

15:46.833 --> 15:48.567
"OH! OH! OH! OH!

15:48.567 --> 15:50.167
OH! OH! OH!"

15:50.167 --> 15:51.500
- HA HA HA!

15:51.500 --> 15:53.133
- THAT'S ME, HUH?
WELL, THIS IS YOU.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.633
THIS IS YOU.

15:54.633 --> 15:56.667
"MEH MEH MEH MEH

15:56.667 --> 15:59.367
MEH MEH MEH MEH
MEH MEH MEH MEH!"

16:02.200 --> 16:06.467
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE MARIE.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.300
- YEAH, THAT'S REALLY
GREAT, RAY, COMIN' HOME

16:08.300 --> 16:09.867
AND GIVIN' ME CRAP
ABOUT A CAN OPENER.

16:09.867 --> 16:11.100
- I DIDN'T GIVE YOU CRAP,

16:11.100 --> 16:12.233
AND IT'S A STUPID
CAN OPENER!

16:12.233 --> 16:13.300
- IT'S NOT STUPID!

16:13.300 --> 16:14.533
IT GETS RID
OF SHARP EDGES!

16:14.533 --> 16:15.467
- AND THE TUNA!

16:15.467 --> 16:16.500
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT.
- NO!

16:16.500 --> 16:19.233
- YOU SHUT UP!
- HEY!

16:21.333 --> 16:23.067
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.567
WE HAPPEN TO HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE

16:24.567 --> 16:26.167
FOR SOME REAL
PERSONAL GROWTH

16:26.167 --> 16:28.467
THROUGH ACTIVE DIALOGUE.

16:28.467 --> 16:29.667
- [snoring]

16:32.667 --> 16:33.700
- STOP IT, DAD!

16:37.333 --> 16:40.467
NOW, THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE TO JUST COME OUT

16:40.467 --> 16:42.400
AND SAY WHAT'S
REALLY BOTHERIN' YOU UNDERNEATH

16:42.400 --> 16:44.233
AND GET IT OUT
IN THE OPEN AND DEAL WITH IT.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.167
'CAUSE IF THERE'S
ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED

16:46.167 --> 16:47.600
IN MY MANY YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE

16:47.600 --> 16:48.600
WITH DOMESTIC DISPUTES,

16:48.600 --> 16:50.267
IT IS THIS--

16:50.267 --> 16:54.567
IT'S NEVER JUST
ABOUT THE CAN OPENER.

16:54.567 --> 16:58.533
- YEAH. SOMETIMES IT'S
ABOUT A JAR OF FAT.

17:00.233 --> 17:03.133
- HOW COULD YOU
MENTION THAT?

17:03.133 --> 17:04.333
- I'LL MENTION IT.

17:04.333 --> 17:08.333
YOU WENT NUTS
OVER NOTHIN'.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.800
- I HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO GO NUTS

17:09.800 --> 17:11.467
WITH YOU
FOR A HUSBAND.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.667
- DON'T GO NUTS.
JUST GO.

17:13.667 --> 17:14.667
- OHH!

17:14.667 --> 17:16.100
- OKAY. WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT. WAIT.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.767
WHAT JAR OF FAT?

17:18.767 --> 17:21.700
- UNHHH...
- AHHH...

17:23.233 --> 17:25.733
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT JAR OF FAT.

17:25.733 --> 17:28.267
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

17:28.267 --> 17:32.167
IT WAS FAT FROM PANCETTA
AND GOLDEN BROWN SAUSAGE.

17:32.167 --> 17:35.367
YOU'D HAVE TO BE
A COOK TO UNDERSTAND.

17:36.733 --> 17:38.767
BUT IT WAS MONTHS
OF CAREFULLY SELECTING

17:38.767 --> 17:41.367
ONLY THE BEST DRIPPINGS

17:41.367 --> 17:43.533
TO PREPARE MEALS
FOR IL DUCE.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.100
- YEAH, YOU MADE
ALL THOSE MEALS JUST FOR ME,

17:47.100 --> 17:49.033
AND THEN YOU
WENT OUT JOGGING.

17:49.033 --> 17:50.600
- THAT WAS MY KITCHEN!

17:50.600 --> 17:52.700
YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO GO IN THERE
AND THROW OUT MY FAT.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.633
- THAT JAR WAS FOR MY COINS!
I NEEDED THAT!

17:54.633 --> 17:56.233
- YOU'RE SELFISH!
- FAT COLLECTOR!

17:56.233 --> 17:58.667
- OH, YOU NEVER
APPRECIATED ME, EVER!

17:58.667 --> 18:00.967
YOU NEVER,
EVER APPRECIATED ME!

18:00.967 --> 18:03.733
I WOULD WORK MY FINGERS TO THE
BONE ALL DAY WITH THE KIDS,

18:03.733 --> 18:05.833
WITH THE COOKING AND THE
CLEANING AND THE LAUNDRY.

18:05.833 --> 18:08.233
AND THEN YOU'D WALTZ IN
WITH YOUR LIST OF DEMANDS

18:08.233 --> 18:09.700
AND NOT EVEN
A THANK YOU.

18:09.700 --> 18:13.267
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- DEBRA UNDERSTANDS.

18:13.267 --> 18:16.567
- YOU WANTED A THANK YOU?
WHERE WAS MY THANK YOU?

18:16.567 --> 18:17.667
I WALTZED IN, HUH?

18:17.667 --> 18:19.567
I DRAGGED MY ASS HOME
EVERY DAY

18:19.567 --> 18:21.833
AFTER 10 HOURS
STUCK IN A SUIT,

18:21.833 --> 18:23.700
STUCK IN AN OFFICE,

18:23.700 --> 18:25.400
STUCK IN A CAR.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.700
AND IF I NEEDED COINS
TO PAY THE TOLLS

18:27.700 --> 18:30.833
THAT GOT ME TO THAT JOB
THAT PAID FOR THAT MEAT

18:30.833 --> 18:32.600
THAT MADE THAT FAT,

18:32.600 --> 18:34.333
THEN I'LL DUMP IT OUT
WHENEVER I WANT,

18:34.333 --> 18:36.433
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY!

18:45.700 --> 18:47.167
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T CARE.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.567
YOU HAVE NEVER CARED

18:48.567 --> 18:51.500
ABOUT HOW HARD I WORK
JUST TO SERVE YOU.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.067
- HEY, I DON'T
HAVE TO CARE.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.300
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.733
- ON THE OTHER HAND...

19:20.733 --> 19:23.667
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE
ABOUT THE CAN OPENER.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.033
- THAT'S WHAT
I WAS GONNA SAY.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.533
- YEAH.
YEAH. ME TOO.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.400
YEAH.
- I'M SORRY.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.033
- YEAH. ME TOO.
SORRY.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.933
- THAT'S IT?

19:39.933 --> 19:41.133
"SORRY"?

19:41.133 --> 19:44.300
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

19:44.300 --> 19:47.367
AT LEAST WHEN WE FIGHT,
STUFF COMES OUT.

19:47.367 --> 19:49.167
- SOME OF IT
WILL BE COMING OUT

19:49.167 --> 19:50.567
WHEN WE GET HOME.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
LET'S GO.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.067
- COMING.

19:57.967 --> 20:00.300
- SO THAT'S
MY JOB, FRANK?

20:00.300 --> 20:03.667
- YEAH. I--I DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE BAD AT IT.

20:05.867 --> 20:07.200
- THANK YOU!

20:07.200 --> 20:09.200
I'M STILL MAD AT YOU.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.133
- WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:11.133 --> 20:14.933
AT LEAST IT'S NOT
ABOUT A CAN OPENER.

20:14.933 --> 20:17.433
- [chuckling]
A CAN OPENER.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.800
- GOOD LUCK, RAY!

20:21.800 --> 20:23.433
OOH OOH OOH OOH.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.733
- I CAN STILL
SEE YOU, FRANK.

20:36.933 --> 20:41.000
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT,
UH, AFTER AN ARGUMENT?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.867
IT'S THE WAY WE MAKE UP.
[chuckles]

20:43.867 --> 20:45.467
- CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHIN', RAY?

20:45.467 --> 20:48.000
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S MY JOB

20:48.000 --> 20:50.067
JUST TO COOK AND CLEAN
FOR YOU, DO YOU?

20:51.867 --> 20:53.000
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.400
WE ALREADY HAD
THE ARGUMENT.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.700
THIS IS
THE MAKING-UP PART.

20:57.700 --> 20:58.833
- NO, NO. IT'S JUST--

20:58.833 --> 21:00.533
NO, WHAT YOUR FATHER
SAID TO YOUR MOTHER.

21:00.533 --> 21:01.900
THAT'S WHAT WAS
BOTHERING ME

21:01.900 --> 21:03.200
ABOUT THAT
WHOLE CAN OPENER THING.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.667
I MEAN, I JUST FEEL

21:04.667 --> 21:06.567
WITH, LIKE, EVERYTHING
I HAVE TO DO AROUND HERE,

21:06.567 --> 21:08.800
SOMETIMES YOU KINDA
TAKE ME FOR GRANTED.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.000
- I DON'T.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.200
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU DO.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.700
I DO, AND, YOU KNOW,

21:13.700 --> 21:15.733
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU
DON'T TAKE ME FOR GRANTED.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.833
- UH...AHH,
IT'S NOTHIN'.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.733
- NO. REALLY,
I WANT TO KNOW.

21:20.733 --> 21:22.300
- WELL, IT'S JUST...

21:22.300 --> 21:24.233
LIKE, SOMETIMES I FEEL
WHEN I COME TO BED THAT...

21:24.233 --> 21:25.700
I'M JUST SOMEBODY

21:25.700 --> 21:27.467
WHO'S HERE TO LAY
NEXT TO YOU.

21:27.467 --> 21:28.767
YOU KNOW?

21:28.767 --> 21:31.900
AND...AND THAT'S ALL.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.967
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, RAY.

21:33.967 --> 21:36.500
- NO, 'CAUSE I NEED TO FEEL
LIKE I'M MORE THAN THAT.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.000
- YOU SHOULD STOP TALKIN'.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.167
- OKAY. I MEAN, IT'S JUST
NICE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED.

21:40.167 --> 21:42.667
- YEAH, YEAH, LET'S
GET THIS OVER WITH.
