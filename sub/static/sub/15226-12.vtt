01:22.548 --> 01:24.415
Hey, hello,
                          Latka.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.456
Good. He's not
here yet.

01:31.491 --> 01:32.791
Bobby's not here.

01:32.825 --> 01:34.225
I bought him
a gift.

01:34.259 --> 01:35.961
Can you guess
what it is?

01:35.995 --> 01:37.629
(laughs)

01:37.663 --> 01:40.298
A beach ball.

01:40.332 --> 01:42.266
Oh... yeah.

01:42.301 --> 01:44.736
Okay, but can you guess

01:44.738 --> 01:45.870
what color it is?

01:45.905 --> 01:48.807
Red, green, yellow and blue.

01:48.841 --> 01:51.242
Yeah, that's right.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.711
But, uh, okay,

01:53.745 --> 01:55.746
can you guess

01:55.781 --> 01:57.048
how much did it cost me?

01:57.082 --> 01:59.518
About ten dollars.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.419
Yeah.

02:02.922 --> 02:06.024
That's right, okay,
      but can you guess...

02:06.058 --> 02:08.826
All right,
  how tall was the saleslady?

02:08.895 --> 02:11.229
Five foot three.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.964
Not even close, Mr. Know-It-All.

02:13.999 --> 02:16.033
Anybody else want to guess?

02:16.068 --> 02:17.669
ELAINE:
                          Latka,

02:17.703 --> 02:19.370
Bobby hasn't moved out
       to California yet.

02:19.405 --> 02:21.872
He just went there
   to do a television pilot.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.140
Yeah, that's right.

02:23.175 --> 02:24.809
The network isn't sure about
  making it into a series yet.

02:24.843 --> 02:26.077
You know what I mean.

02:26.111 --> 02:27.512
Yeah. Besides,
    you buying Bobby a gift

02:27.546 --> 02:29.246
makes the rest of us look bad.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.514
Oh, no, no, no.

02:30.549 --> 02:34.352
You see, he expects it from me
 because I am his best friend.

02:34.386 --> 02:35.786
Oh.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.122
What... What are you talking
      about, best friend, Latka?

02:38.156 --> 02:39.890
Everybody knows I'm
            Bobby's best friend.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.859
Ha, ha, ha.

02:43.929 --> 02:46.931
It's so silly,
it make me laugh.

02:46.965 --> 02:49.667
There is nobody closer
than me and Bobby.

02:49.701 --> 02:51.603
Hey, Latka, you
              know, you're nuts.

02:51.637 --> 02:53.071
Me and Bobby go out together,

02:53.105 --> 02:54.772
me and Bobby go
              to games together,

02:54.807 --> 02:56.474
me and Bobby go
         chasing girls together.

02:56.508 --> 02:58.510
Whenever he's got a
           problem, he calls me.

02:58.544 --> 03:00.245
He does that to you?
                   That's right.

03:00.279 --> 03:02.814
Well, then I can see
how that can confuse you.

03:02.848 --> 03:06.117
But-but, really, Tony, really,

03:06.152 --> 03:08.019
but he and I are best friends.

03:08.053 --> 03:11.322
Anyway, if he's not going
       to-to California,

03:11.356 --> 03:15.026
I'd better return this to
 the six-feet tall saleslady...

03:17.029 --> 03:19.697
...and get
                 something else.

03:19.732 --> 03:20.898
(scoffs)
                        (laughs)

03:20.932 --> 03:22.467
You know, uh,
hey, you know,

03:22.501 --> 03:24.134
Bobby's been gone
almost six months.

03:24.169 --> 03:25.737
Hope he hasn't
changed any.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.105
Yeah, you know, uh,

03:27.107 --> 03:30.441
those people in, uh,
 California are pretty strange.

03:30.475 --> 03:31.542
Yeah.
                           Yeah.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.888
Unlike here.

03:43.922 --> 03:45.956
Wow!

03:46.025 --> 03:47.925
Thanks, you guys.

03:50.196 --> 03:53.398
I really didn't expect this kind
        of welcome home.

03:55.501 --> 03:57.469
I didn't even know I was gone.

03:57.503 --> 03:58.970
ALEX:
Jim?

03:59.005 --> 04:01.306
Yeah.
Your name is Jim,
not Bobby.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.241
Oh, maybe so.

04:03.342 --> 04:08.146
But if someone does
           something nice to me,

04:08.180 --> 04:10.114
I'm not one to nitpick.

04:11.951 --> 04:14.785
You guys are aces.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.721
Nice to be back.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.257
Nice to have you back, Jim.

04:26.098 --> 04:27.532
Hi, everybody!

04:27.566 --> 04:29.334
(excited chatter)

04:30.736 --> 04:32.837
Good to see you!

04:34.373 --> 04:36.007
Wow! Ooh!

04:36.041 --> 04:37.809
Here I am back
            in the garage again!

04:37.843 --> 04:39.611
ELAINE:
                           Yeah.
This place hasn't changed a bit.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.813
Ooh.
TONY:
Come on, Bobbaroo,

04:41.847 --> 04:44.049
there's your
old seat, yeah.
                   Yeah!

04:44.083 --> 04:45.416
Hey, sit down.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.919
Hey, how was California?
Great, huh?
               Yeah?

04:47.953 --> 04:49.120
Oh, I don't know.

04:49.154 --> 04:51.122
Take away the beaches,
          the climate,

04:51.156 --> 04:52.323
the women, the glamour...

04:52.357 --> 04:53.591
still beats this.

04:53.659 --> 04:55.460
(laughter)

04:55.494 --> 04:56.727
It's great
to have him back.

04:56.762 --> 04:58.029
Bobby!
       (excited chatter)

04:58.064 --> 04:59.897
Hey, will you shut up?

04:59.932 --> 05:02.467
I couldn't hear
     myself think in there.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.704
What's all the noise?

05:08.440 --> 05:11.041
Hey, Louie,
guess who's back?

05:12.978 --> 05:14.379
Louie.

05:18.784 --> 05:23.955
Well... Bobby Wheeler,
       the great <i>ac-tor.</i>

05:25.291 --> 05:26.490
If I'd have known
        you were coming,

05:26.525 --> 05:27.825
I'd have baked a ham.

05:29.929 --> 05:33.932
So, come to beg
for your job back, huh, Bob?

05:33.966 --> 05:36.768
Ah, I didn't come
         back here to work, Lou.

05:36.802 --> 05:39.237
You never came
here to work, Wheeler.

05:39.271 --> 05:41.239
He don't need
your job no more, Louie.

05:41.273 --> 05:42.941
He's a big TV star now.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.343
Hey, hey, hey, Tony,
    I'm not a star yet, huh?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.613
Yeah, well, Bobby did
              a pilot and that's
                 the first step.

05:48.647 --> 05:49.948
Oh, yeah?

05:49.982 --> 05:53.584
Well, I happen
            to know a little bit
             about the TV world.

05:53.618 --> 05:56.120
Donahue did a whole
                  show about it.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.091
They make hundreds
           of pilots every year,

06:00.125 --> 06:01.960
and maybe two
                 or three of 'em

06:01.994 --> 06:04.329
ever become series, hmm.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.065
Yeah, but I have
          a feeling that Bobby's
        is gonna be one of them.

06:07.099 --> 06:09.200
Yeah, I think it has a chance.

06:09.234 --> 06:10.768
Well, I don't.
Why not?

06:10.803 --> 06:12.904
Because Wheeler's in it.

06:12.938 --> 06:15.239
Everything he touches
         is a failure.

06:15.307 --> 06:17.609
I mean, if he was
at Gettysburg,

06:17.611 --> 06:20.444
we'd be singing "Dixie"
       before ball games.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.246
(Louie laughs)

06:22.281 --> 06:23.915
ALEX:
Yeah, well, you'd better
watch out, Louie,

06:23.949 --> 06:26.483
because this time
I think you're in
for a big surprise.

06:26.518 --> 06:28.986
The only thing that
     surprises me, Reiger,

06:29.021 --> 06:30.922
is how the rest
       of you can manage

06:30.956 --> 06:33.590
to keep up this masquerade
         of confidence

06:33.625 --> 06:35.226
in George C. Scum here.

06:37.329 --> 06:38.963
If you held a gun to his head,

06:38.997 --> 06:40.865
Wheeler couldn't
      act nervous, ha-ha!

06:42.467 --> 06:45.270
When this guy's in a play,
  the highest priced seats are

06:45.304 --> 06:47.071
near the exits.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.343
When this fellow goes onstage,

06:52.377 --> 06:54.745
they have to put sick bags
       behind the seats.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.381
(laughs)

06:59.919 --> 07:02.120
ALEX:
All right, all right, all right,
    all right, Louie, Louie,

07:02.154 --> 07:03.354
Louie, let me
ask you something.

07:03.388 --> 07:04.489
Let me ask you something.

07:05.791 --> 07:08.893
What if Bobby
does get the series?

07:08.927 --> 07:11.829
Ha!
No, I mean it.
What if he does get the series?

07:11.864 --> 07:13.764
What, what, what?
      Well, you name it, Reiger.

07:13.799 --> 07:15.233
You want to make
              a little bet here?

07:15.267 --> 07:16.300
A hundred bucks?
No, no, no.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.136
200 bucks?
                      500 bucks?
      No, no.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.370
No, no, no money.

07:19.405 --> 07:20.738
What, what, what?

07:20.772 --> 07:23.574
All right.

07:23.608 --> 07:25.443
You congratulate him
     in front of all of us.

07:27.278 --> 07:31.181
Couldn't I just take out my
     appendix with a warm spoon?

07:33.952 --> 07:35.386
Sick bags!

07:36.889 --> 07:37.955
Come on, come on, Louie.

07:37.989 --> 07:39.390
Hey, Lou, come on.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.459
Now, now you're
so sure of yourself,

07:41.493 --> 07:42.927
what do you say?

07:42.929 --> 07:45.596
All right, all right, for sure,
      fine, I can't lose.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.765
All right, all right,
         if Wheeler's show

07:47.799 --> 07:50.201
becomes a television series,

07:50.236 --> 07:53.171
I'll congratulate him
     in front of everybody.
Right.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.473
And then,

07:55.507 --> 07:57.174
I'll go down and
              sprinkle rock salt

07:57.209 --> 07:58.209
where hell froze over.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.712
(both laughing)

08:00.714 --> 08:02.113
Warm spoon!

08:02.147 --> 08:04.015
(cackling)

08:05.050 --> 08:06.817
Ah, come on, everybody,
let's, come on.

08:06.851 --> 08:08.319
Let's take this party
over to Mario's.
                     Yeah.

08:08.353 --> 08:09.687
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

08:09.721 --> 08:12.923
Well, I'm not saying that
  Bobby Wheeler's a bad actor,

08:12.925 --> 08:14.325
but the only one who ever

08:14.359 --> 08:17.361
waited for him backstage
      was the playwright,

08:17.395 --> 08:19.530
and he had a hammer, ha-ha!

08:19.565 --> 08:22.100
A hammer,
he had a hammer.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.769
A baseball bat,
he had a baseball bat.
         No, no, no...

08:24.803 --> 08:27.138
A rubber hose.
(grumbles)

08:27.172 --> 08:28.439
He had a rubber hose.

08:28.473 --> 08:30.408
That's a straight
line, Louie.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.049
Okay. Okay, now you got
       the number, right?

08:40.085 --> 08:42.186
Now, if you hear anything,
      just call me, okay?

08:42.220 --> 08:44.054
If you hear <i>anything.</i>

08:44.087 --> 08:46.223
All right, thanks, good-bye.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.625
(Bobby sighs)

08:47.659 --> 08:49.493
Well, Mr. Wheeler.

08:50.695 --> 08:53.497
Okay, I want to hear
everything about your pilot.

08:53.532 --> 08:54.598
Yeah.
           Oh, okay.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.501
Well, it's a hour-long
        dramatic series.
Mm-hmm.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.504
And I play the oldest son
in an old family clan in Idaho.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.139
It's called <i>Boise.</i>

09:01.173 --> 09:03.875
Oh...
                     Can't miss.

09:03.909 --> 09:07.145
I love it! I already feel like
 it's one of my favorite shows.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.113
Guess how much they're
      gonna pay me a week

09:09.147 --> 09:10.714
if this thing goes to series?

09:10.749 --> 09:11.983
Just take a wild stab.

09:12.017 --> 09:13.985
150,000 bucks a week.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.153
No, not 150,000 bucks a week.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.722
No newcomer makes
150,000 bucks a week.

09:18.756 --> 09:20.091
Then how much?

09:20.125 --> 09:24.262
$3,500 a week.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.531
Hey! That's pretty good!

09:26.565 --> 09:28.065
That's pretty good.

09:28.099 --> 09:29.700
What do you mean,
"pretty good"?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.002
It's fantastic.

09:31.036 --> 09:33.337
You know, if you hadn't
said "150,000 bucks" a week,"

09:33.371 --> 09:34.973
everybody'd be going
crazy right now.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.139
That's okay,
                 it's okay, Bob.

09:36.174 --> 09:37.709
It's okay, we're impressed.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.010
Yeah, Bobby, if that's the best
         you could do,

09:39.044 --> 09:40.845
it's the best you could do.

09:40.879 --> 09:43.681
Tony, have you gotten dumber
     since I've been away?

09:43.715 --> 09:46.283
Phone call, Bobby.
                It's your agent.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.652
Oh, no.
      Oh, no, he's heard.

09:47.686 --> 09:48.952
I can't move.

09:48.987 --> 09:50.188
I-I-I can't breathe.

09:50.222 --> 09:51.855
Somebody get the phone
          for me, huh?

09:51.890 --> 09:53.157
I'll get it.

09:57.196 --> 09:58.996
Hello, Sid?

09:59.030 --> 10:00.631
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.500
Yeah?

10:02.534 --> 10:05.135
Well, what'd they say?

10:05.170 --> 10:07.338
Well, what did you say?

10:07.372 --> 10:09.574
Well, well, okay, listen.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.842
I'll, I'll get back
         to you, okay?

10:11.876 --> 10:13.578
Yeah, and, uh,
    and thanks for calling.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.149
(sighs)

10:23.455 --> 10:25.656
The party's over.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.925
Oh, not again.
                         Oh, no.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.992
This party's over!

10:29.027 --> 10:32.029
Now, we start celebrating
       my new TV series!

10:32.064 --> 10:33.831
(excited chatter)

10:35.801 --> 10:39.070
Come on, this is the way
     cab drivers celebrate,

10:39.104 --> 10:40.838
not the way
      TV stars celebrate.

10:40.872 --> 10:43.074
I'm gonna rent a hotel suite
        up at the Plaza,

10:43.108 --> 10:45.142
and I'm gonna show you
     what a real party is!

10:45.177 --> 10:47.979
ALL (chanting):
      <i>Boise! Boise! Boise!</i>

10:48.013 --> 10:49.781
<i>Boise! Boise!</i>
         Hold it down.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.315
Hold it down.

10:51.349 --> 10:54.952
You ain't, you ain't
       seen <i>porfnig</i> yet.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.523
Bobby, now that you are
 going to be back in New York,

10:59.557 --> 11:01.258
I bought you a present.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.394
But you have
      to guess what it is.

11:04.629 --> 11:05.763
I will give you hint.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.336
It, it keep you warm

11:12.371 --> 11:15.172
and it rhyme with "zearmuffs."

11:16.808 --> 11:18.609
Earmuffs.
                     Earmuffs.

11:18.643 --> 11:19.777
ALEX:
Earmuffs.

11:19.811 --> 11:21.745
Earmuffs.

11:25.384 --> 11:28.352
Give up?

11:28.387 --> 11:30.521
It is earmuffs.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.124
Hey, Latka, listen,
I really appreciate it,

11:34.159 --> 11:35.593
but I'm not gonna be
       needing them now.

11:35.627 --> 11:38.329
I got the series,
  and I'm going to California.

11:38.363 --> 11:40.765
Come on, we're moving the party
        up to the Plaza.

11:40.767 --> 11:41.699
(excited chatter)
            All right, let's go!

11:41.733 --> 11:44.135
ALL (chanting):
      <i>Boise! Boise! Boise!</i>

11:44.169 --> 11:46.770
<i>Boise! Boise! Boise...</i>

11:54.513 --> 11:57.347
You know, uh, this champagne
    isn't quite cold enough.

11:57.382 --> 11:58.582
Would you make sure
         the next batch

11:58.617 --> 11:59.884
is a little more chilled,
            please?

11:59.918 --> 12:01.451
Yes, sir.

12:03.221 --> 12:04.655
Psst!

12:06.024 --> 12:08.526
And by the way,

12:08.560 --> 12:11.328
all these meatballs
         got toothpicks in them.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.902
Tell them to be more
      careful back there.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.205
See?

12:28.380 --> 12:29.580
A toast...

12:29.614 --> 12:31.749
to our friend
         who is with us again,

12:31.783 --> 12:33.718
but who will soon
                  be leaving us,

12:33.752 --> 12:36.086
but who will take with him
         all of our best wishes.

12:39.357 --> 12:41.692
You know...

12:41.727 --> 12:43.594
I can't think
     of any group of people

12:43.629 --> 12:46.497
I'd like to share
     this moment with more.

12:46.565 --> 12:49.400
I mean, you guys have been
 with me through the bad times

12:49.434 --> 12:51.202
and through the good times,

12:51.236 --> 12:53.971
and finally now,
         a great time.

12:54.005 --> 12:55.740
Hear, hear.
     (Elaine sighs, laughs)

12:55.774 --> 12:58.042
I just wish there was some way
 I could take you all with me.

12:58.076 --> 13:01.078
Well, since you can't,
could I have your juicer?

13:01.112 --> 13:02.346
(phone ringing)

13:02.380 --> 13:04.048
I got it. I got it.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.651
Hello. Oh, yeah,
       hang on a second.

13:07.685 --> 13:08.753
Hey, Bobby, it's your agent.

13:08.787 --> 13:09.953
Oh, yeah?
                     Yeah.

13:09.988 --> 13:11.155
Make more money...

13:11.189 --> 13:12.489
Hey, Sid,
         how you doin'?

13:13.992 --> 13:17.061
What is it?

13:17.095 --> 13:19.696
What?

13:19.730 --> 13:21.665
They what?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.901
But, but why?

13:26.304 --> 13:28.138
Well, what did you say to them?

13:28.173 --> 13:32.175
Ho... hold it, hold it,
     hold it, hold it, Sid.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.779
Sid, you said an hour ago
      everything was fine.

13:34.813 --> 13:38.516
Listen, isn't there
anything we can do?

13:38.550 --> 13:40.551
Listen, Sid,
   they can't do this to me!

13:40.585 --> 13:42.420
Come on, this is my life!

13:42.454 --> 13:45.323
Oh, God!

13:46.557 --> 13:49.260
Hey, he's got me curious.

13:57.202 --> 13:59.103
Damn it, Bobby,
         I just don't understand

13:59.137 --> 14:00.805
how a thing like
                this can happen.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.139
I mean, this is not fair!

14:02.173 --> 14:03.874
You went out there,
       you made a pilot.

14:03.908 --> 14:05.109
They sold it,
         they loved it.

14:05.143 --> 14:06.977
And now they're
    gonna recast your part?

14:07.045 --> 14:08.645
I can't believe it.

14:08.679 --> 14:10.014
I, I can't believe it.

14:10.048 --> 14:11.648
I mean, it's not
        happening to me.

14:15.186 --> 14:16.287
Here we go.

14:16.321 --> 14:18.555
For the California
                      beach boy.

14:18.589 --> 14:20.657
Just the thing for
                 fun in the sun.

14:20.691 --> 14:22.927
You bought me
a beach ball?

14:22.961 --> 14:25.595
Thank you, big mouth.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.299
Yeah.

14:28.333 --> 14:33.504
Latka, Bobby's going
to stay in New York.

14:33.538 --> 14:35.138
They recast his part.

14:35.173 --> 14:36.941
Is true?

14:38.843 --> 14:40.878
Oh, okay, well, I don't mind.

14:40.912 --> 14:44.414
I like to be laughed at
by the clerks in the toy store.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.621
I just don't
understand this.

14:50.655 --> 14:52.556
Didn't they give
you any explanation?

14:52.590 --> 14:55.393
Oh yeah, they gave
              me an explanation.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.127
Yeah? Well, this
               I'd like to hear.
Yeah.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.532
They said I wasn't
                sexy enough.

15:01.566 --> 15:03.166
What?

15:03.168 --> 15:05.135
I don't understand.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.339
BOBBY:
      They gotta be crazy.

15:09.441 --> 15:12.176
I mean, I ooze sex.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.144
I mean, look at my teeth

15:14.146 --> 15:17.414
and my hair,
my height.

15:17.448 --> 15:19.717
I'm a sexy guy.

15:25.123 --> 15:28.058
Uh, excuse me.

15:28.092 --> 15:29.393
<i>Sí.</i>

15:29.428 --> 15:30.994
Do you speak English?

15:31.029 --> 15:32.963
<i>Sí.</i>

15:35.801 --> 15:37.068
Do you think I'm sexy?

15:37.102 --> 15:38.903
<i>Sí.</i>

15:40.204 --> 15:41.939
Do you think
                  I'm very sexy?

15:41.973 --> 15:43.340
<i>Sí.</i>

15:45.109 --> 15:46.910
I'm gonna ask you seriously

15:46.944 --> 15:48.745
and, and please
                don't lie to me.

15:50.315 --> 15:55.119
Do you think that
        I'm really, really sexy?

15:56.220 --> 15:58.388
You are a sex god, señor.

16:00.325 --> 16:02.759
See?
                      ALEX: Bob,

16:02.828 --> 16:05.696
Bob, Bob, listen, those people
    in Hollywood are crazy.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.264
Now, look, I'm not gonna
          let you give up.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.932
There's gotta be
    something you could do.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.967
Oh, oh, there's
something I could do.

16:11.002 --> 16:15.339
Uh, I'm going to wander
the streets aimlessly

16:15.373 --> 16:18.475
and ride the subways
     and babble to myself.

16:20.212 --> 16:23.614
And crawl back to Louie on my
belly, begging for my job back.

16:23.648 --> 16:25.048
That's the spirit.

16:26.317 --> 16:27.484
Bobby, look.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.053
You gotta look
on the bright side of things.

16:29.087 --> 16:30.621
You know, you got
a lot going for you.

16:30.655 --> 16:32.055
Yeah, like what?

16:32.090 --> 16:34.291
Like us.
                           TONY:
                   That's right.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.593
ALEX:
That's right.

16:35.627 --> 16:39.896
Yeah. One thing I do
                have is friends.

16:39.931 --> 16:40.964
The "one thing"?

16:40.998 --> 16:42.700
The one? Ah, come on, Bob.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.535
Ah, look, let's everybody
      just sit right here

16:44.569 --> 16:47.571
and remind Mr. Wheeler
about the great things

16:47.606 --> 16:49.440
that he's got that
are a lot more important

16:49.474 --> 16:51.208
than some television
show, all right?

16:51.242 --> 16:52.409
ELAINE:
Yeah.

16:58.883 --> 17:01.785
You know, I'm feeling
       a lot better now.

17:01.819 --> 17:02.986
I want to thank you guys.

17:03.021 --> 17:04.521
It's all right.
                    Oh.
               Oh, great, Bobby.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.525
I think I can even face
 going back to the garage now.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.059
Hey, Bob, I know it ain't much,

17:09.094 --> 17:10.761
but at least we'll all
       be together again.

17:10.795 --> 17:12.195
Yeah. You can still
   Yeah.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.131
go on those auditions
               like you used to.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.499
Yeah, yeah...

17:15.532 --> 17:17.500
No, no, no, no, Bobby.

17:17.535 --> 17:19.536
Going back to
             the garage would be
               the worst mistake

17:19.569 --> 17:20.871
you'd ever make
                   in your life.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.106
What, what are you
         talking about?

17:22.140 --> 17:23.373
Bobby, come here.

17:23.406 --> 17:24.708
Come here, let me
                  show you this.
         What?

17:24.742 --> 17:25.810
Look here.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.144
What do you see out there?

17:27.244 --> 17:29.813
An old woman
               clubbing pigeons.

17:29.847 --> 17:32.015
No, no, not down there,
up there.

17:32.049 --> 17:34.084
Oh, the sunrise.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.019
Yeah, Bobby,
it's a new day.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.821
And you know what's great
        about this day?

17:37.856 --> 17:39.590
It doesn't belong
        to anybody yet.

17:39.624 --> 17:41.758
It could belong to you, Bob.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.259
But it won't
   if you stick around here.

17:43.294 --> 17:45.195
Now, look, come on,
      you went out there.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.897
The best thing that ever
happened to you was this,

17:46.931 --> 17:48.299
was this shot
at the pilot.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.268
I mean, you got experience,
you made contacts.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.504
Bobby, you gotta
follow through with this.

17:53.538 --> 17:55.472
You gotta go back to California.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.374
Look, maybe this one
didn't work out,

17:57.409 --> 17:58.609
but the next one will.

17:58.643 --> 17:59.677
Or the one after that.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.745
Or the one
          after that.

18:01.779 --> 18:04.247
Or the one after that.

18:04.281 --> 18:06.717
Or the one
          after that.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.753
ELAINE:
          Jim, he got the point.

18:11.456 --> 18:14.425
"The grey-eyed morn
smiles on frowning night,

18:14.459 --> 18:18.662
"Chequering the eastern clouds
with streaks of light,

18:18.697 --> 18:22.700
"And fleckled darkness
like a drunken reels

18:22.734 --> 18:28.572
"From forth day's path
and Titan's fiery wheels."

18:30.174 --> 18:32.109
(sighs)

18:33.277 --> 18:34.578
That's good, Bob.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.013
TONY:
                           Yeah.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.382
I've still got a plane ticket
         to California.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.786
And tomorrow, I'm gonna be
      on that noon flight.

18:45.423 --> 18:47.258
Or the one after that.

18:51.963 --> 18:54.131
Let's go.
      Welcome home, Bobby.

18:54.165 --> 18:56.032
Oh.
     Here are you earmuffs.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.301
Oh, gee, Latka, thanks.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.638
But, see, I won't
      be needing them now.

19:00.672 --> 19:03.941
I'm going out to California,
     and I'm gonna make it.

19:03.943 --> 19:07.677
Oh, and then I suppose you want
        the beach ball?

19:07.712 --> 19:09.513
And then when I give you
        the beach ball,

19:09.547 --> 19:11.147
you're going
     to want the earmuffs?

19:11.182 --> 19:13.784
Well, you got another
       thing coming, pal,

19:13.818 --> 19:15.719
because I don't care.

19:15.754 --> 19:16.887
I am fed up.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.255
I don't care where you go,

19:18.289 --> 19:20.624
what you do, when you do it,
      when you get there.

19:20.658 --> 19:23.160
I don't care.
    You're making me crazy.

19:23.194 --> 19:25.695
(speaking native language)

19:25.730 --> 19:27.030
Earmuffs, beach ball.
         Yeah, Latka...

19:27.065 --> 19:28.332
Earmuffs, beach ball...

19:28.366 --> 19:30.301
(continues in native language)

19:39.444 --> 19:41.177
Well, everybody,
                  I'm on my way.

19:41.212 --> 19:43.913
Hey, uh, Lou.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.950
All right, don't make this
 any harder than it has to be.

19:46.984 --> 19:49.253
I said I was gonna
       congratulate him,

19:49.287 --> 19:50.987
and that's exactly
       what I'm gonna do.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.658
Hey, hey, Louie,
              listen, you really
        don't have to do that...

19:54.692 --> 19:56.126
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.427
No, no, no, no, no...
                    No, but I...

19:57.461 --> 19:58.662
I'd like to hear this.
                Alex, I would...

19:58.696 --> 20:00.064
I would really like
to hear this.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.232
All right, well,
 then shut up and let me do it.

20:04.035 --> 20:07.303
All right, uh, Wheeler.

20:07.338 --> 20:10.507
I know that I, I rode you hard
 when you worked here and, uh,

20:10.541 --> 20:13.744
I hope that, uh,
     that doesn't keep you

20:13.778 --> 20:15.345
from believing
     what I'm about to say.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.713
(clears throat)

20:16.747 --> 20:18.047
I was wrong.

20:18.082 --> 20:20.216
Everybody else was right.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.319
You probably are talented,

20:22.353 --> 20:24.521
because you're getting out
         of this place.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.424
It's something I gave up on
        a long time ago.

20:28.926 --> 20:32.262
Eh, you'll go out there,
  probably become a big star.

20:32.330 --> 20:35.933
And if, uh, something like that
    should happen, and, uh,

20:35.967 --> 20:38.802
you are still
        not mad at me...

20:38.837 --> 20:41.171
maybe send me a picture
         or something.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.940
Congratulations and I
          wish you all the best.

20:51.282 --> 20:52.716
Hey, uh, look, Lou, I,

20:52.750 --> 20:55.986
I wasn't gonna say
      anything, but, uh...

20:56.020 --> 20:57.620
I want to give you
        a good-bye gift.

20:57.655 --> 20:59.923
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
you shouldn't do that.
      No, no, yeah, yeah.

21:02.293 --> 21:07.564
Look, uh, Louie,
    I didn't get the series.

21:07.598 --> 21:11.001
They liked
the pilot, but, uh,

21:11.035 --> 21:12.636
they're getting rid of me.

21:14.639 --> 21:16.273
They did that to you?

21:17.375 --> 21:19.343
Oh...

21:19.377 --> 21:21.311
(sobbing)

21:24.315 --> 21:26.083
Hey, hey, come on,
                     Louie, huh?

21:26.117 --> 21:27.951
Come on, don't
take it like that.

21:27.985 --> 21:30.153
I can't help it.

21:30.188 --> 21:32.956
(laughing):
             That's the funniest
             thing I ever heard.

21:37.395 --> 21:38.529
(laughs)

21:38.563 --> 21:39.663
(whooping)

21:40.898 --> 21:43.867
Hey, mister, you want
    to hear something funny?

21:48.840 --> 21:52.242
You know, Alex, I think
 I'm gonna miss him the least.

21:52.276 --> 21:54.111
(laughs)

21:55.346 --> 21:57.347
I guess this is good-bye.

21:57.381 --> 21:58.982
Oh, no.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.185
Hey, listen, we're gonna be
     seeing a lot of each other.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.086
You'll go out there,
            I'll come back here.
Yeah.

22:03.121 --> 22:07.423
Let's just say...
                      "so long."

22:07.459 --> 22:09.192
So long.

22:16.101 --> 22:17.333
Take it easy, bro.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.641
We're gonna be seeing you
         on television

22:24.675 --> 22:26.210
sooner than you think.

22:26.244 --> 22:26.876
Yeah.

22:26.945 --> 22:28.845
Or the one after that.

22:41.659 --> 22:43.893
Well, um...

22:43.928 --> 22:46.063
good-bye, Bob.

22:46.097 --> 22:49.332
Hey, Alex,
   it's not really good-bye.

22:49.366 --> 22:51.234
It's more like
      "I'll see ya later."

22:51.268 --> 22:53.437
Come on, we're gonna be seeing
   a lot more of each other.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.239
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

22:55.273 --> 22:57.441
What, what do you
               mean, "maybe"?

22:57.475 --> 22:59.342
Well, I mean, come on,
     you know, if you, uh,

22:59.376 --> 23:02.545
if you make it out there, uh,
   your life's gonna change.

23:02.580 --> 23:05.082
I mean, you're gonna get busy.

23:05.116 --> 23:06.249
You're gonna travel.

23:06.283 --> 23:07.550
You're gonna make new friends.

23:07.585 --> 23:09.586
You know that and I know that.

23:09.687 --> 23:13.390
You know, Bobby,
if you become a star,

23:13.424 --> 23:15.526
there's a good chance we'll
never see each other again.

23:21.299 --> 23:23.566
Here's hoping we never
     see each other again.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.472
Yeah.
(chuckles)

23:30.809 --> 23:32.409
Go get 'em.
     Go get 'em.

23:32.443 --> 23:34.044
Huh?
               All right.

23:35.579 --> 23:36.480
(sighs)

24:01.439 --> 24:02.772
(theme song playing)

24:27.232 --> 24:28.632
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:28.666 --> 24:29.633
