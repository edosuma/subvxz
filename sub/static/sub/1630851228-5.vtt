Race to the fountain?

from a gunshot wound

It's Forrester.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.775
- Okay, an American journalist
has been found dead in Krakow.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.430
The victim is Philip Blake,
34 years old,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.954
former reporter
for "The Washington Post."

03:35.998 --> 03:38.392
But recently he's been working
as a freelance contributor

03:38.435 --> 03:40.872
for a variety
of online publications.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.309
He specializes
in national security.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.701
- Based in Berlin,

03:43.745 --> 03:46.008
Blake was in Krakow
for less than 24 hours

03:46.051 --> 03:49.098
before collapsing
on the street near his hotel.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.796
- Cause of death?
- Officially unknown.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.582
- Officially?
- Polish police suspect poison.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.018
- Is this heading
where I think it is?

03:56.061 --> 03:57.367
- The Kremlin has
a long history

03:57.411 --> 04:00.196
of poisoning dissidents
and journalists.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.373
But targeting an American
would be a major escalation.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.941
- So whoever killed him wanted
an international incident.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.334
- Or needed him dead bad enough

04:07.377 --> 04:09.118
that they were willing
to risk it.

04:09.161 --> 04:12.121
- How do we know he didn't just
eat a bad shrimp or something?

04:12.164 --> 04:13.775
- The poison was quite lethal.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.342
He went from drinking
his morning tea

04:15.385 --> 04:18.214
to bleeding to death internally
in a matter of minutes.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.911
- If the Russians are trying
to shut down a story

04:19.955 --> 04:22.436
or send a message,
others could be in danger.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.220
We need to get on
the ground right away.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.396
- Notify IOD

she was the last person

06:00.708 --> 06:02.536
- Any connections to Russia?

06:02.579 --> 06:04.799
FSB?
- None that are obvious.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.366
- They often aren't.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.280
Hmm. I'll keep looking.

We're hoping you can
help us figure out

06:29.911 --> 06:30.955
who killed your friend.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.785
How well did you know
Mr. Blake?

06:34.829 --> 06:37.745
- Um, I met him six
or seven months ago,

06:37.788 --> 06:40.443
when I was
in Germany for a story.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.445
I didn't know much
about national defense,

06:42.489 --> 06:44.926
so ask him
for help with background.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.797
We had lunch.
We traded numbers.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.103
That was it.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.887
I told him if he ever
came to Krakow,

06:49.931 --> 06:51.454
I would show him around.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.413
- And he reached out to you?

06:53.456 --> 06:56.459
- Yeah, a few days ago.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.549
He said he was coming to town
to meet with a source.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
- Who was his source?
- I don't know.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.944
- What was the story about?

07:02.987 --> 07:05.250
- Well, he wouldn't
say that, either.

07:05.294 --> 07:08.253
I was hoping to ask him
about it tonight.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.994
- You had plans
to meet with him?

07:10.038 --> 07:13.302
- Yes, but for dinner,
not in the morning.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.086
That's what I was trying
to tell the officers.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.915
I shouldn't be here.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.440
- So you were his only contact
in the city.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.355
- I gave him advice
on where to stay,

07:23.399 --> 07:25.357
what to see, how to get around.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.490
- And you knew exactly
where he would be?

07:27.534 --> 07:28.839
And when?

07:28.883 --> 07:31.973
- I was giving a colleague
travel advice,

07:32.016 --> 07:33.714
not setting him up
to be killed.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.106
- So you never went
to the hotel?

07:35.150 --> 07:36.978
You never met
with Blake in person?

07:37.021 --> 07:39.676
- No, he was here for a story,
not for me.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.635
- Did you text him
from any other device

07:41.678 --> 07:43.071
than the one
you gave the police?

07:43.114 --> 07:44.420
- No, why would I?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.682
- In the moments
before his death,

07:45.726 --> 07:48.293
he received a text
from an encrypted number

07:48.337 --> 07:51.993
including one
that said "I'm sorry."

07:52.036 --> 07:53.037
- That wasn't me.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.561
I mean, you have to believe me.

07:54.604 --> 07:58.303
That has nothing to do with me.
He told me nothing.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.958
I thought he was trying
to impress me with his work,

08:01.002 --> 08:02.960
make it seem mysterious.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.875
But now I wonder,
maybe if he would tell me

08:04.919 --> 08:06.181
I would be dead too.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.230
Can I go now?
I mean, I'm sorry.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.058
But I just want to forget
it all happened.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.631
- What do you think?

08:21.675 --> 08:23.720
- If she were an FSB agent,

08:23.764 --> 08:25.635
she'd probably have
a better story.

08:25.679 --> 08:26.897
- I get the feeling
she's downplaying

08:26.941 --> 08:27.898
her relationship to Blake.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.247
- She's married.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.553
You think
it's more than professional?

08:30.597 --> 08:31.946
- Maybe, but I didn't pick up
any indication

08:31.989 --> 08:33.513
she wanted him dead.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.862
Seems like she really
cared about him.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
- If everything she says
checks out, we let her go.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.345
- Hey, I've been looking

08:40.389 --> 08:41.738
through Blake's
published articles.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.653
There were a handful
about Russia a few years ago,

08:43.697 --> 08:45.829
but nothing that would've
raised eyebrows at the Kremlin.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.744
- All right, Kellett and I
will head to the crime scene.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.921
Check in with Legat Berlin,
see if we can find the wife.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.881
If Blake's keeping secrets,
personally or professionally,

08:53.924 --> 08:55.056
I want to know about it.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.057
Tank!

08:59.103 --> 09:00.235
- The gentleman was seated
over there.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.889
Alone.

09:01.932 --> 09:05.109
And after about half an hour,
he left without paying.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.721
I was in the lobby
and I saw him rush upstairs.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.505
- When Blake was here,
the only thing he had was tea?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.767
- Correct.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.900
- Was the reservation
for one or two?

09:12.943 --> 09:15.642
- Two. Two, I believe.
But no one else arrived.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.599
- We're going to need
to question

09:16.643 --> 09:17.818
your waitstaff as well.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.210
- If you must.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.298
But we served
the same tea all morning,

09:20.342 --> 09:22.387
and no one else got sick.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.825
This hotel does not poison
its guests.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.391
- I'm sure
they appreciate that.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.788
- Stay.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.268
- Older hotel,

09:33.311 --> 09:35.749
no cameras except for
the lobby and elevator.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.054
I'm guessing whoever did this

09:37.098 --> 09:39.579
was smart enough
to use the stairs.

09:39.622 --> 09:43.060
- Good news.
The poison was radioactive.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.409
- That's good news?

09:44.453 --> 09:46.324
- No signs of nerve
or chemical agents.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.674
The Evidence Response Team
believes that

09:47.717 --> 09:49.284
Blake was killed from exposure

09:49.327 --> 09:52.461
to a small quantity
of a rare radioactive metal.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.116
- Ooh. Polonium?

09:55.159 --> 09:57.118
Like what killed Litvinenko
in 2006?

09:57.161 --> 09:58.902
- This is a new isotope--
more deadly,

09:58.946 --> 10:01.209
but with
an extremely short half-life.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.645
- And it wasn't in the tea.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.692
- No, it was in the hotel room.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.868
Mask up and I'll show you.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.133
- Uh, we good with this?

10:12.176 --> 10:14.135
- Don't worry, the levels
are no longer harmful.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.398
And in a few hours,
they'll be nearly undetectable.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.794
It's good.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.623
The entire bathroom
was treated with the poison.

10:23.666 --> 10:27.844
Sink, toilet handle, shower.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.672
He turns on
the water to brush his teeth,

10:29.716 --> 10:31.456
brings his hand to his face,

10:31.500 --> 10:35.025
breathes in,
and his fate is sealed.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.679
He was dead hours
before he knew it.

10:36.723 --> 10:43.294
<i>♪</i>

10:43.338 --> 10:44.687
- And the housekeeper?

10:44.731 --> 10:45.819
- Collateral damage.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.518
The crazy thing is,
if not for her death,

10:49.561 --> 10:51.651
the police never would have
looked in the hotel room.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.262
By the time anyone
suspected poison,

10:54.305 --> 10:56.438
all the radioactive material
would have decayed,

10:56.481 --> 10:57.613
leaving no trace.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.225
- What I want to know is,

11:01.269 --> 11:02.792
what was so important
in Blake's room

11:02.836 --> 11:04.838
that he had to run back up
to get it?

11:04.881 --> 11:06.230
- After the killer applied
the poison,

11:06.274 --> 11:07.754
he would go somewhere close

11:07.797 --> 11:09.799
to take off his protective gear
and clean up, right?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.627
- It would minimize
the risk of exposure

11:13.107 --> 11:14.412
- So where did that happen?

11:33.518 --> 11:36.260
- Who was in this room?

11:36.304 --> 11:39.046
- The occupants of room 415
checked out early this morning.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.700
- Did you get their names
at check-in?

11:40.743 --> 11:41.831
- Of course.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.922
I do remember
they spoke Russian.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.839
Ah, yes.

11:49.883 --> 11:53.582
The names are Arvydas Sabonis
and Andrei Kirilenko.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.063
- Aliases?
- Yeah, definitely.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.629
Unless our killers

valuable information
from Russia.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.041
They choose me
because I am nobody.

23:54.084 --> 23:57.131
No one would be spying on me.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.655
But I called Philip
because I was afraid.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.832
I just didn't know
what else to do.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.966
He arranged for the meeting,
and he took all the risk.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.621
Now he's dead because of me.

Blake was scheduled to meet
with an anonymous source

25:47.154 --> 25:50.636
high in Russia's Ministry
of Defense, codename Dasha.

25:50.679 --> 25:53.421
It's a woman's name meaning
"gift of God" in Russian.

25:53.464 --> 25:56.555
She or he offered
to share test results

hypersonic missile capability

25:59.819 --> 26:02.517

so nervous.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.399

couldn't plug their leak,

26:17.663 --> 26:20.230

on the journalist

26:20.274 --> 26:21.971

back into the shadows.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.625

was the CIA's target all along.

all of that now.

26:33.809 --> 26:34.897

would lead me to Dasha,

26:51.566 --> 26:54.047
- Great. So what's your plan?

26:54.090 --> 26:57.398
Once Dasha realizes that
the whole world is on the hunt,

26:57.441 --> 26:59.661
we'll never reel them in.
We need to act fast.

"I'm sorry."

38:53.418 --> 38:54.897
or even mention
that there's a traitor

38:54.941 --> 38:56.595
within the Ministry of Defense.

38:56.638 --> 38:58.205
- As far as the world
is concerned,

38:58.248 --> 38:59.685
it's all rumor and speculation.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.382
There is no source.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.906
- It's a compromise, but by
allowing them to save face,

39:03.950 --> 39:06.256
we end the threat
of retribution,

39:06.300 --> 39:09.042
providing security
for journalists moving forward.

39:09.085 --> 39:13.176
- And my husband's death?
That's the price?

39:13.220 --> 39:15.135
- Well, the killers have been
brought to justice,

39:15.178 --> 39:17.006
but unfortunately,
without a way to link

39:17.050 --> 39:18.878
the order directly to the FSB,

39:18.921 --> 39:21.663
calling them out publicly
only puts more people at risk.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.321
- I understand.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.760
Phil would have wanted
his colleagues to carry on.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.155
- The schematics we recovered

39:35.198 --> 39:37.287
will lead to a more effective
defense system.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.551
It could save
thousands of lives.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.727
That doesn't happen
without his courage.

39:43.598 --> 39:44.730
- And all of yours.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.613
- I think I should
get some sleep.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.310
- You deserve it.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.878
Do you think you'll keep
writing for the paper?

40:02.922 --> 40:05.185
- Honestly, I don't know.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.756
But if I do, I know
that somebody has my back.

40:33.692 --> 40:36.695
- Well, look at that.
A man of his word.

40:39.045 --> 40:41.569
- Any luck finding Dasha?

40:44.442 --> 40:47.401
Was it worth it?
- What?

40:47.445 --> 40:49.142
- Will that one secret
really save more lives

40:49.185 --> 40:51.231
than were lost
trying to get it?

40:51.274 --> 40:55.235
- I don't know.
But I'm not losing any sleep.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.628
- That must be nice,

40:56.671 --> 40:59.369
only caring about secrets
and not actual people.

40:59.413 --> 41:02.068
- What are you talking about?
I'm a people person.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.375
In fact, I got
a little something for you.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.859
A personal thank you
for the FBI's help.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.611
That's Moscow. Two weeks ago.

Your mother's still out there.
