00:21.105 --> 00:24.691
Hello, my name is Marty
Di Bergi. I'm a filmmaker.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.485
I make a lot of commercials.

00:27.569 --> 00:31.030
That little dog that chases the
covered wagon underneath the sink?

00:31.115 --> 00:32.115
That was mine.

00:33.534 --> 00:37.995
In 1966, I went down to
Greenwich Village, New York City,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.998
to a rock club called
The Electric Banana.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.376
Don't look for it,
it's not there anymore.

00:43.460 --> 00:48.965
But that night, I heard a band that for
me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll."

00:49.883 --> 00:55.430
I remember being knocked out by
their exuberance, their raw power

00:55.514 --> 00:57.432
and their punctuality.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.436
That band was Britain's
now legendary Spinal Tap.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.940
Seventeen years
and 15 albums later,

01:06.024 --> 01:08.818
Spinal Tap is
still going strong.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.571
And they've earned a
distinguished place in rock history

01:11.655 --> 01:14.198
as one of
England's loudest bands.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.577
So, in the late fall of 1982,

01:17.661 --> 01:21.831
when I heard that Tap was releasing
a new album called Smell the Glove,

01:21.915 --> 01:25.126
and was planning their first tour of
the United States in almost six years

01:25.210 --> 01:26.586
to promote that album,

01:26.670 --> 01:30.423
well, needless to say, I jumped at
the chance to make the documentary,

01:30.507 --> 01:34.510
the, if you will, rockumentary
that you are about to see.

01:35.304 --> 01:40.057
I wanted to capture the
sights, the sounds, the smells

01:40.809 --> 01:43.519
of a hard-working
rock band on the road.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.521
And I got that.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.732
But I got more.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.609
A lot more.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.403
But, hey,
enough of my yakking.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.197
What do you say?
Let's boogie.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.209
Gives me a lot of energy,
makes me happy.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.252
Heavy metal is deep.
You can get stuff out of it.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.295
The way they dress.
The leather.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.131
Which one is this?
Is this LaGuardia...

02:12.216 --> 02:13.966
No, this is JFK.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.593
Oh, yes.
New York, New York.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.766
Watch it now.
Watch it now!

02:29.525 --> 02:31.275
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

02:33.487 --> 02:36.072
It's like you become one
with the guys in the band.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.867
I mean, there's no division,
you just...

02:40.619 --> 02:45.957
The music just unites
people with the players.

02:46.041 --> 02:50.461
Come on and ride, direct
from hell, Spinal Tap!

02:50.921 --> 02:52.964
(SINGING) You're hot
You take all we got

02:53.048 --> 02:55.591
Not a dry seat in the house

02:56.385 --> 02:58.469
Next day
We'll be on our way

02:58.554 --> 03:00.721
But tonight I'm gonna rock you
Tonight I'm gonna rock you

03:00.806 --> 03:03.516
Yes, tonight I'm gonna rock
you Tonight I'm gonna rock you

03:03.600 --> 03:04.809
Tonight!

03:04.893 --> 03:06.644
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

03:09.940 --> 03:12.149
We are Spinal Tap
from the UK!

03:12.234 --> 03:14.402
You must be the USA!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.849
Little girl,
it's a great big world

03:44.933 --> 03:46.809
But there's only one of

03:48.270 --> 03:53.399
Me!

04:03.452 --> 04:05.202
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

04:10.834 --> 04:13.210
Let's talk a little bit about
the history of the group.

04:13.295 --> 04:17.173
I understand, Nigel, you and
David originally started the band

04:17.257 --> 04:19.759
back in, when was it, 1964?

04:19.843 --> 04:21.469
Before that, we were
in different groups.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.930
I was in a group called The
Creatures, which was a skiffle group.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.056
I was in Lovely Lads.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.266
And then we
looked at each other

04:27.351 --> 04:30.561
and said, well,
we might as well join up.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.481
So we became The Originals. Right.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.192
And we had to change
our name, actually.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.028
Well, there was another group in
the East End called The Originals.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.447
You know, we had to
rename ourselves.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.074
New Originals.
New Originals.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.368
And then they became...
The Regulars.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.953
They changed their name
back to The Regulars.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.539
We thought, well, we could go back to
The Originals, but what's the point?

04:50.624 --> 04:53.000
Then we became The
Thamesmen at that point.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.796
(SINGING) Stop wasting my time

04:58.757 --> 05:00.549
You know what I want

05:02.219 --> 05:03.886
You know what I need

05:05.681 --> 05:07.431
Or maybe you don't

05:09.059 --> 05:13.729
Do I have to come right flat
out and tell you everything?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.565
Gimme some money

05:17.150 --> 05:20.319
Gimme some money

05:26.576 --> 05:28.244
Your first drummer was...

05:28.328 --> 05:30.538
The Peeper.
John "Stumpy" Pepys.

05:30.622 --> 05:35.543
Great, great tall,
blonde geek with glasses.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.170
Good drummer. Great
look, good drummer, yeah.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.338
Good, good drummer.
Fine drummer.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.090
MARTY: What happened to him?

05:41.174 --> 05:45.928
He died. He died in a bizarre
gardening accident some years back.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.681
It's really one of
those things. It was...

05:48.765 --> 05:54.145
The authorities said best
leave it unsolved, really.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.355
And he was replaced by...

05:56.440 --> 05:57.523
DAVID: Stumpy Joe.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.275
Eric "Stumpy Joe" Childs.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.027
MARTY: And what happened
to Stumpy Joe?

06:01.111 --> 06:04.613
DEREK: Well, it's not
a very pleasant story.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.199
He's passed on.
He died...

06:07.284 --> 06:09.035
He choked on...

06:09.119 --> 06:13.289
The official explanation
was he choked on vomit.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.291
He passed away.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.127
It was actually
someone else's vomit.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.253
It was ugly.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.921
NIGEL: You know,
there's no real...

06:21.006 --> 06:24.175
They can't prove whose vomit
it was. They don't have...

06:24.259 --> 06:25.217
There's no prints.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.385
...facilities
in Scotland Yard.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.095
There's no way to print
a spectra-photograph.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.221
You can't really
dust for vomit.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.266
Here we go.
Hello.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.727
SoHo, they call this. SoHo.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.479
"So" what?

How are you doing?

06:50.494 --> 06:51.744
Come over here.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.912
(MOUTHING) I want you to meet everybody.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.580

Viv! Come over here, everybody.
With the record company?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.628
So... Yes, Bobbi Flekman.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.004
Bobbi, of course,
how are you?

You know, you know.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.594
Hi, handsome,
how are you doing?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.555
All right, listen, I want you
to all meet Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.390
Now, he's the head of Polymer. We know.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.601
You, don't talk so much,
just smile a little. Smile.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.727
Oh,
she knows...

07:16.812 --> 07:19.230
Denis, come here!
Come here.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.149
I want you to meet Spinal Tap.
They're our guests of honor.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.275
How very nice to meet you.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.111
Kids, this is
Sir Denis Eton-Hogg.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.320
This is Nigel.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.404
Yeah, this is Nigel.
Hi.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.740
Thanks a lot
for letting us...

07:30.408 --> 07:33.202
Let's go over here, and we'll
all take a picture together.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.830
Where's Christine?
Where's my photographer?

07:35.914 --> 07:38.457
Come over here, honey.
What's your name? Christine?

07:39.167 --> 07:41.043
BOBBI: Okay, right over here.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.504
Good. Good!

07:43.588 --> 07:44.839
He's not into negro music.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.216
No, no, I don't
eat that shit.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.261
Guys, you look great.
I mean, you look fantastic.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.012
You would never know
you were almost 40.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.305
I mean,
if I looked this good...

07:53.390 --> 07:55.391
And from the stage, too,
it's amazing.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.226
I did the Bird.
Do the Dead Bird.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.936
Change this, get the dwarf
cannolis, the little ones.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.313
All right. I did the Bird.
Come on! Don't talk back.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.107
Mime is money. Let's go!
Come on, move it!

08:03.525 --> 08:05.985
Now, we here at Polymer,
we're all looking forward

08:06.069 --> 08:10.364
to a long and fruitful
relationship with Spinal Tap.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.702
We wish them great success
on their North American tour.

08:14.786 --> 08:19.665

ARNIE: Excuse me,
are you reading Yes I Can?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.009
Yeah, have you read it?

08:30.093 --> 08:31.510
Yeah, by Sammy Davis Jr.?

08:31.595 --> 08:32.595
WOMAN: Yeah.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.431
You know what the title
of that book should be?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.350
Yes, I Can, if Frank
Sinatra Says It's Okay.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.476
(MARTY LAUGHING)

08:39.561 --> 08:42.354
'Cause Frank calls the
shots for all those guys.

08:42.438 --> 08:46.192
Did you get to the part yet where
Sammy's coming out of the Copa,

08:46.276 --> 08:50.446
and it's about 3:00 in the
morning, and he sees Frank?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.365
Frank's walking down
Broadway by himself...

08:55.952 --> 08:57.494
Fucking limeys.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.872
Well, they're not
used to that world.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.165
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I know.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.918
Frank Sinatra. It's a
different world that they're in.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.754
It's just,
people like this,

09:08.089 --> 09:09.173
they get all they want,

09:09.257 --> 09:12.676
so they don't really understand
about a life like Frank's.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.305
I mean, when you've loved
and lost the way Frank has,

09:16.431 --> 09:18.515
then you know
what life's about.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.559
The Times may even do
something. NIGEL: Really?

09:20.644 --> 09:22.728
DAVID: The New York Times?
The New York Times.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.606
The bump we've got to iron out here
is when do we get the album released?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.108
I mean, it doesn't matter how good
the press is or what the stringers...

09:28.193 --> 09:29.902
IAN: As I explained
last night,

09:29.986 --> 09:33.072
we're not gonna saturate
the New York market.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.324
Now, Philly, now that's
a real rock 'n' roll town.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.575
DAVID: Oh,
Philly's a great town.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.869
Be assured that the
album will be available

09:38.954 --> 09:41.413
all through the Philadelphia
metropolitan area.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.915
DAVID: So you are
hitting that market.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.918
We're certainly doing...

09:46.002 --> 09:48.254
I'm doing everything I can.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.588
You know that
we're not blaming you.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.091
But you don't feel that these
guys have an effect on an audience.

09:52.175 --> 09:55.010
I mean, kids go to their
concert, they have a great time...

09:55.095 --> 09:58.389
But it's a passing thing.
It's...

09:59.683 --> 10:04.687

them this, but this is a fad.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.343
I met her on Monday

11:17.427 --> 11:19.511
It was my lucky bun day

11:19.596 --> 11:21.930

I love her each weekday

Let's talk about your
reviews a little bit.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.603
Regarding
Intravenus de Milo,

12:09.687 --> 12:12.189
"This tasteless cover
is a good indication

12:12.273 --> 12:14.775
"of the lack of
musical invention within.

"The musical growth rate of
this band cannot even be charted.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.408
"They're treading water in a sea of
retarded sexuality and bad poetry."

"'and couldn't he have
rested on that day, too?"'

12:38.258 --> 12:41.218
I never heard that one. That's
a good one. That's a good one.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.636
The review you had
on Shark Sandwich,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.764
which was merely
a two-word review,

12:45.890 --> 12:48.225
it just said,
"Shit sandwich."

12:48.309 --> 12:49.726
(CHUCKLING)

12:49.811 --> 12:51.437
DEREK: Where'd they print
that? Who printed that?

12:51.521 --> 12:53.188
That's not real, is it?
DEREK: You can't print that.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.317
DAVID: You know, all those arguments
about touring or not touring,

12:57.402 --> 12:59.778
and all that, I mean, it's
obvious, we belong on tour.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.864
You know, it's a great idea.
MARTY: I couldn't agree more.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.115
You know all that stuff
about you being too old

13:03.199 --> 13:04.324
and you being too white...
DEREK: Yeah.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.618
But what about
the album, Ian?

13:06.703 --> 13:07.744
Well, that's
the real problem...

13:07.829 --> 13:09.246
There's beginning
to be a refrain here.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.623
You know, there's no way to promote
something that doesn't exist,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.083
you know?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.626
It's a very
unimportant reason.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.546
It's just that they're just
experimenting with a...

13:17.630 --> 13:19.381
With some new
packaging materials.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.757
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Right, let me get the door.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.801
What kind of experimenting? They
got monkeys opening it or what?

13:22.886 --> 13:25.971
The other thing is that the
Boston gig has been canceled.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.055
DAVID: What?
Yeah.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.641
I wouldn't worry about it, though,
it's not a big college town.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.439
Hey, I heard you boys had an
album coming out right now?

13:35.523 --> 13:37.941
DAVID: Yeah, it's Smell the
Glove. It should be out now...

13:38.026 --> 13:40.194
Smell the Glove?
Smell the Glove, yeah.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.696
It's a provocative title.
I love it.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.364
Wait till you see the cover,
wait till you see the cover.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.908
Very provocative indeed.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.869
IAN: Bobbi, can I tear
you away from all this?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.497
Do you have a drink?

13:51.581 --> 13:53.373
No, I don't...
I don't really need one.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.001
But, listen, I really do
have to talk to you a bit

13:56.085 --> 13:57.336
about this whole
issue of the...

13:57.420 --> 13:59.505
Ian, just tell me
whatever's on your mind.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.131
The issue of the cover.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.966
Yeah?
Um...

14:03.134 --> 14:07.137
We... I mean, we feel,
and it seems to be facts,

14:07.472 --> 14:09.640
that the company is rather down
on the cover. Is that the case?

14:09.766 --> 14:11.725
Yes. You can give it to
me straight, you know.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.852
Listen, they don't
like the cover.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.437
They don't like the cover.
That's certainly straight.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.106
They find it very offensive
and very sexist.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.733
Well, what exactly
do you find offensive?

14:19.859 --> 14:24.029
Ian, you put a greased, naked
woman... I mean, what's offensive?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.447
...on all fours...
Yes.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.533
...with a dog collar around
her neck... With a dog collar.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.117
...and a leash...
And a leash.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.119
...and a man's arm,
extended out,

14:31.204 --> 14:33.455
up to here,
holding on to the leash

14:33.540 --> 14:37.292
and pushing a black glove
in her face to sniff it.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.044
You don't find that
offensive? No, I don't.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.212
You don't find that sexist?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.672
This is 1982, Bobbi,
come on.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.049
That's right, it's 1982.
Get out of the '60s.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.426
We don't have this mentality
anymore. Listen to me.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.928
Well, you should've seen
the cover they wanted to do.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.388
I don't care... It wasn't
a glove, believe me.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.472
See, now this is
something, Ian,

14:50.557 --> 14:52.182
that you're going to have
to talk to your boys about.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.767
We're certainly not
laying down any conditions.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.394
And I don't think
a sexy cover is the answer

14:55.478 --> 14:57.062
for why an album sells
or doesn't sell.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.399
Because, you tell me, The
White Album, what was that?

15:00.483 --> 15:01.984
There was nothing on
that goddamn cover.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.110
(PHONE RINGING)

15:03.152 --> 15:04.653
Excuse me, the phone's ringing. Sure.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.904
Ian, we'll talk
about this after.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.072
Okay, right, love.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.448
Hello?

15:08.575 --> 15:09.950
Hi, Denis.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.202
Uh-oh.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.621
Okay. Why don't you tell him?

15:14.998 --> 15:16.540
Okay, hold on one minute.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.708
Ian?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.751
It's Eaton-Hogg.
He wants to talk to you.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.836
Okay. Thank you, darling.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.713
You're welcome, dear.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.966
Hello, Sir Denis?

15:26.301 --> 15:27.843
Hi, how are you?

15:30.888 --> 15:32.014
Oh!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.183
Fucking old poofter!

15:36.269 --> 15:39.771
But it's really not that
offensive, Sir Denis, come on.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.526
Okay. I'll call you absolutely
first thing in the morning.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.904
Oh, shit!

15:48.281 --> 15:50.616
They're not going
to release the album,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.869
because they have decided
that the cover is sexist.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.912
NIGEL: Well, so what?
DEREK: Yeah.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.956
What's wrong with being sexy?
I mean, there's no...

15:58.041 --> 15:59.625
Sexist!
"Ist."

15:59.751 --> 16:01.627
They wanted sexy. Okay, listen,
I wanted to tell you this,

16:01.711 --> 16:03.211
and I was holding back,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.797
because I didn't know what
Denis' decision was going to be.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.634
But, at this point, both
Sears and Kmart stores have

16:08.718 --> 16:10.218
refused to
handle the album.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.929
They're boycotting the album
only because of the cover.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.014
If the first album
was a hit...

16:14.098 --> 16:15.098
If a company's
behind an album,

16:15.183 --> 16:17.225
it can shove it
right down their throats.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.728
Money talks and
bullshit walks.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.605
And if the first
album was a hit,

16:21.689 --> 16:22.981
then we could've
pressed on them,

16:23.066 --> 16:24.316
then we could've told them,

16:24.400 --> 16:25.776
"Yes, let's..."
The music, every cut,

16:25.902 --> 16:27.819
on this album is a hit. I don't
give a shit what the album...

16:27.904 --> 16:29.863
It's a matter of
compromise. It was a joke.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.074
And they're making it a big deal.
Yeah, that's it. That's true.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.367
You know, if we were
serious, and we said,

16:33.451 --> 16:36.328
"Yes, she should be forced
to smell the glove,"

16:36.412 --> 16:38.997
then you'd have a point, you know,
but it's all a joke, isn't it?

16:39.082 --> 16:40.999
I mean, it's making fun...
Well, it is and it isn't.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.167
We're making fun of
that sort of thing.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.669
She should be made
to smell it, you know?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.671
DAVID: Not, you know, over
and over again, of course.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.506
Listen, the thing is, we can
probably work something out.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.342
I'll talk to Denis and maybe we
can come up with a compromise.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.844
A new design concept
that we can all live with.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.221
You guys were schoolmates?

16:54.305 --> 16:58.225
We don't... We're not
university material.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.143
What's that on your finger?
It's my gum.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.478
What are you doing
with it on your finger?

17:01.562 --> 17:03.355
I might need it later.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.941
Put it on the table,
that's terrible.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.651
I might forget
it on the table.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.444
How old were you guys when you
met? I can't take him anywhere.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.865
NIGEL: About eight years old.
Eight or nine.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.617
DAVID: You were eight
and I was seven.

17:16.703 --> 17:17.786
That's right, yeah.

17:17.869 --> 17:21.790
MARTY: Do you remember the first song
that you guys ever wrote together?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.709
All The Way Home,
probably.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.751
Yeah.
All The Way Home?

17:24.836 --> 17:27.546
Yeah. Can you remember
a little bit of it?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.965
I'd love to hear it.
Christ.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.550
With some black coffee
maybe we could do it.

17:31.634 --> 17:32.884
How does it go?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.261
(HUMMING)

17:34.637 --> 17:37.514
BOTH: (SINGING) I was standing
there beside the railroad track

17:37.598 --> 17:38.724
(HUMMING)

17:38.808 --> 17:41.977
And I'm waiting for that
train to bring you back

17:42.186 --> 17:43.645
Bring you back

17:43.730 --> 17:45.564
(BOTH MUMBLING)

17:45.648 --> 17:51.486
If she's not on the 5:19, then
I'm gonna know what sorrow means

17:51.821 --> 17:55.282
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
All the way home

17:56.159 --> 17:58.535
All the way home

17:58.619 --> 18:00.996
All the way home
All the way home

18:01.164 --> 18:02.539
(CLEARING THROAT)

18:02.623 --> 18:04.916
Cry, cry, cry
all the way home...

18:05.334 --> 18:08.128
It's fairly simple. It's about six
words in the whole song, you know.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.921
We just repeat them over
and over again. Yeah.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.965
Let's talk about
your music today.

18:12.049 --> 18:17.137
One thing that puzzles me is
the make-up of your audience

18:17.221 --> 18:21.433
seems to be, predominantly,
young boys.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.935
Well, it's
a sexual thing, really.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.772
Aside from the identifying
that boys do with us,

18:26.856 --> 18:29.900
there's also like
a reaction to the female...

18:29.984 --> 18:31.651
Of the female to our music.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.819
What was the way... Yeah.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.237
Really, they're
quite fearful.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.322
That's my theory.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.158
They see us on stage,
with tight trousers.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.869
We've got, you know,
armadillos in our trousers.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.121
I mean, it's really quite
frightening, the size.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.581
Yeah.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.957
And they run screaming.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.084
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

18:51.088 --> 18:53.173
Ian, can I have a word
with you for a minute?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.466
Yes, of course.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.469
Listen, we have problems...

18:57.553 --> 18:58.678
What?

18:58.763 --> 19:00.806
...with the arrangements
backstage.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.141
What exactly?
What, I mean...

19:03.226 --> 19:04.893
Well, no, there's
some problems here.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.144
I don't even know
where to start.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.022
All right, this... No,
no, no. Sound check? What?

19:09.106 --> 19:12.400
This, this... Look, there's
a little problem with the...

19:12.485 --> 19:14.319
Look, this miniature bread,

19:14.403 --> 19:18.448
it's, like, I've been working with
this now for about half an hour.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.827
I can't figure out... Let's
say I want a bite, right?

19:21.911 --> 19:23.328
I got this...
You'd like bigger bread?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.955
Exactly. I don't
understand how...

19:25.039 --> 19:26.456
You could just
fold this, though.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.625
Well, no, then it's half the
size. I mean, you could fold it.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.502
No, not the bread.
You just fold the meat.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.337
Yeah, but then
it breaks apart.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.421
No, no, no.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.048
You put it on the bread
like this, see?

19:35.132 --> 19:37.467
But then if you keep folding
it, it keeps breaking...

19:37.552 --> 19:39.052
But why would you
keep folding it?

19:39.136 --> 19:42.514
...and everything has to be
folded, and then it's this.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.433
And I don't want this,
I want large bread,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.310
so that I can put this...

19:47.395 --> 19:48.520
Right.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.147
...so then it's like this.
But this doesn't work,

19:51.232 --> 19:52.649
because then it's all...

19:52.733 --> 19:54.067
Because it hangs out
like that.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.194
Look, would you be
holding this?

19:56.279 --> 19:58.029
No, I wouldn't want to
put that in my mouth.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.240
All right, A. Exhibit A.
No, you're right.

20:00.324 --> 20:03.827
And then we move onto this.
Look. Who's in here? No one.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.538
And then in here,
there's a little guy. Look.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.123
So it's a complete
catastrophe!

20:08.207 --> 20:09.332
No, you're right.
Nigel, Nigel...

20:09.417 --> 20:11.001
But calm down. Calm down.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.210
Calm... No, it's no big deal.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.795
It's a joke, really.
I'm sorry.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.214
It's just some cracker
university, you know?

20:16.299 --> 20:17.591
No, it's a joke.
No, I really...

20:17.675 --> 20:19.217
I don't want it to affect
your performance. All right?

20:19.302 --> 20:21.094
It's not going to
affect my performance.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.929
Don't worry about it,
all right?

20:23.014 --> 20:24.055
I just hate it, really.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.307
It does disturb me.
It won't happen again.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.475
But I'll rise above it,
I'm a professional.

in a hell hole

20:44.201 --> 20:48.580
Girl, get me back
to my hell hole

21:39.423 --> 21:41.216
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

21:42.218 --> 21:44.260
MAN: Do Stonehenge!

21:44.762 --> 21:47.430
Do you actually
play all these, or...

21:48.349 --> 21:50.642
Well, I play them
and I cherish them.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.478
This is at the top of the heap, right
here. There's no question about it.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.940
Look at the flame on that
one. I mean, it's just...

21:57.024 --> 21:58.817
It's quite unbelievable.

21:58.901 --> 22:04.864
This one is just perfect.
1959, you cannot...

22:04.949 --> 22:07.701
How much... Listen,
just listen for a minute.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.077
The sustain, listen to it.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.745
I'm not hearing anything.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.164
You would, though,
if it were playing,

22:13.249 --> 22:16.084
because it really is
famous for its sustain.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.335
You can just hold it...

22:17.420 --> 22:18.586
So you'd have to play...

22:18.671 --> 22:19.713
(VOCALIZING)

22:19.797 --> 22:21.214
You can go and
have a bite and...

22:21.298 --> 22:22.507
(VOCALIZING)

22:22.591 --> 22:23.800
You'd still be
hearing that one.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.510
Can you hold this a sec?
Sure.

22:25.594 --> 22:29.639
This one... This, of course,
is a custom three-pickup Paul.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.891
This is my radio unit.

22:31.976 --> 22:36.896
So I strap this piece on, right
down in here when I'm on stage.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.149
It's a wireless.
Wireless, exactly.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.776
And I can play without
all the mucky-muck.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.528
You can run anywhere on
stage with that. Exactly.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.698
Now, this is special, too.
Look. See?

22:46.782 --> 22:49.868
Still got the old tagger on
it, see? Never even played it.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.286
You just bought it?
Don't touch it!

22:51.370 --> 22:53.329
Don't touch it. No one...
I wasn't gonna touch it.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.206
No. Don't touch it.
I was just pointing at it.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.292
Well, don't point, even.
Don't even point?

22:57.376 --> 22:59.794
No. It can't be
played. Never.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.171
Can I look at it?

23:01.255 --> 23:02.714
No, you've seen
enough of that one.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.760
This is a top to what we use
on stage, but it's very special,

23:06.844 --> 23:09.054
because if you can see...
Yeah.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.182
...the numbers all go to 11.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.643
Look, right across
the board, 11, 11, 11...

23:15.728 --> 23:17.854
And most of these
amps go up to 10.

23:17.938 --> 23:18.938
Exactly.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.399
Does that mean it's louder?
Is it any louder?

23:21.484 --> 23:24.652
Well, it's one louder,
isn't it? It's not 10.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.697
You see, most blokes
will be playing at 10.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.950
You're on 10 here, all
the way up, all the way up,

23:31.035 --> 23:34.996
you're on 10 on your guitar,
where can you go from there? Where?

23:35.206 --> 23:36.831
I don't know.
Nowhere. Exactly!

23:36.916 --> 23:38.833
What we do is,
if we need that

23:38.918 --> 23:41.711
extra push over the cliff,
you know what we do?

23:41.796 --> 23:44.172
Put it up to 11.
11! Exactly. One louder.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.926
Why don't you just make 10 louder,
and make 10 be the top number,

23:48.010 --> 23:50.220
and make that
a little louder?

23:52.681 --> 23:53.807
These go to 11.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.142
Are you Spinal Tap?

23:56.227 --> 23:57.268
Spinal Tap?
This is Spinal Tap.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.937
Tap, tap, tap, tap.
Welcome to Memphis, gentlemen.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.815
We have a slight problem with your
reservation. Nothing serious, I'm afraid.

24:01.899 --> 24:02.899
How slight?

24:02.983 --> 24:04.609
You wanted
seven suites, yes.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.693
Seven suites.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.947
He mistakenly put you on the
seventh floor, with one suite.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.282
That's considerably
more than minor.

24:11.367 --> 24:15.286
But it's a good size room, sir, it's
a King Leisure. We can get you...

24:15.371 --> 24:18.790
How are we gonna get 14 people
in a King Leisure bed, Tucker?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.792
Don't tempt me, sir. Have a
good time, will you? Take care.

24:20.876 --> 24:21.918
I'll take care of it.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.295
You're welcome, gentlemen. And
very attractive, they are, too.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.839
Listen to me!
Yes, sir.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.841
We want these suites, and
we want them now, okay?

24:27.925 --> 24:29.259
These people are tired.
Yes, we can help you.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.302
We have sound check in an hour.
Reba! Perhaps you can help us.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.720
What's the problem, sir?
Give me a hand, please.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.389
What's the matter? I'll
tell you what's wrong, okay?

24:34.473 --> 24:37.350
This twisted old
fruit here tells me

24:37.434 --> 24:38.977
that you have not
got my reservations.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.145
I'm just as God made me, sir.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.438
What's the difference between
golf and miniature golf?

24:42.523 --> 24:44.232
I think the balls...
The holes are smaller.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.484
Uh-oh! Look out,
here they come.

24:46.569 --> 24:47.986
Duke, Duke!

24:48.070 --> 24:49.737
(GIGGLING)

24:49.822 --> 24:50.822
Can I have your autograph?

24:50.906 --> 24:51.990
DAVID: It's Duke Fame!
It's Duke Fame.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.992
Duke! Duke.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.702
It's okay, we know him.
Spinal Tap.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.163
David St. Hubbins,
Spinal Tap.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.123
Derek Smalls, Spinal Tap.
Nigel...

25:00.207 --> 25:01.207
We gotta get going...

25:01.292 --> 25:02.625
Listen, where are
you playing in town?

25:02.710 --> 25:04.627
You playing here?
We're doing the...

25:04.712 --> 25:06.504
Enormodome, whatever
it is, it's terrific.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.298
Yeah, big place, outside of
town. Sold it out. Very nice.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.674
That's a big place.
You sold it out?

25:09.758 --> 25:10.967
What's that?
20,000 seats?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.844
We really should run,
you know...

25:12.928 --> 25:15.555
Good heavens!
How are you, Laddy?

25:15.639 --> 25:17.307
Great to see you, Ter.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.058
Terrific to see you.
Liam!

25:19.143 --> 25:20.935
Ian. Ian.
Ian, yeah.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.104
Listen, we'd love to
stand around and chat,

25:23.189 --> 25:25.690
but we gotta sit down in the
lobby and wait for the limo.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.817
Okay. Duke, great to see you.
Catch up with you on the road.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.569
Great to see you again,
Terry. Yeah, cheers!

25:29.653 --> 25:30.653
Best of luck.
NIGEL: Duke!

25:30.738 --> 25:31.738
DEREK: We'll catch up
at your house, maybe.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.781
NIGEL: Great! Great!
Great to see you.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.658
See you. See you, Duke.
Good days, good days.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.703
Wanker.
NIGEL: What a wanker.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.913
What a wanker.
DEREK: No-talent sod.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.290
He's got this much talent.
This much, if he's lucky.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.416
DEREK: We carried him.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.043
We had to apologize
for him with our set.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.169
That's right.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.254
People were still
booing him when we went on.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.048
It's all bull.
It's all hype.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.342
We got our rooms.
Big fat suites.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.551
Can I ask you something?

25:53.636 --> 25:56.429
Have you seen Duke Fame's
current album?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.598
Um... Yes, yes.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.266
Have you seen the cover?

26:00.351 --> 26:01.559
No, I don't think I have.

26:01.644 --> 26:02.727
It's a rather lurid cover.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.313
I mean, it's like
naked women, and...

26:05.397 --> 26:08.858
He's tied down to this table,
and they've got these whips,

26:08.984 --> 26:11.319
and they're all
semi-nude... Knocking on him.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.904
And it's like... It's much
worse... What's the point?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.906
Well, the point is that it's
much worse than Smell the Glove.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.450
He releases that,
and he's number three!

26:17.534 --> 26:18.826
Because he's the victim.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.204
Their objections were that
she was the victim, you see.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.288
Oh.
Oh.

26:22.373 --> 26:25.083
That's all right. If the singer's the
victim, it's different. It's not sexist.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.209
He did a twist on it.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.460
DEREK: He did,
he turned it around.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.170
We should have thought
of that. We were so close.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.215
If we had all you guys tied up,
that probably would have been fine.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.716
DEREK: But it's still
a stupid cover.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.636
It's such a fine line
between stupid and clever.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.471
Yeah, just that
little turnabout.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.723
I have a small
piece of bad news.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.308
Although, it may not be that
bad. DAVID: For a change.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.352
We're canceled here.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.187
DAVID: At the hotel?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.690
No, we're canceled.
The gig is canceled.

26:48.857 --> 26:49.983
DAVID: Fuck.

26:50.609 --> 26:54.821
It says, "Memphis show canceled
due to lack of advertising funds."

26:55.406 --> 26:58.116
The last time
Tap toured America,

26:58.951 --> 27:03.413
they were booked into 10,000-seat
arenas and 15,000-seat venues.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.582
And it seems that now,
on the current tour,

27:06.667 --> 27:11.462
they're being booked into
1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas,

27:11.714 --> 27:15.591
and I was just wondering, does this mean
the popularity of the group is waning?

27:15.676 --> 27:17.802
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

27:18.554 --> 27:21.597
No, not at all.
I just think that

27:21.682 --> 27:24.017
their appeal is
becoming more selective.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.101
Ah.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.021
Now, I notice this here, you
got this cricket bat here.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.397
Yes.
Do you play?

27:29.481 --> 27:32.066
No, I carry this
partly out of...

27:32.151 --> 27:34.193
I don't know, sort of...

27:36.488 --> 27:37.697
I suppose,
what's the word?

27:37.781 --> 27:38.823
Affectation?

27:38.907 --> 27:42.493
Yes, I mean, it's a kind of
totemistic thing, you know?

27:42.578 --> 27:44.495
But, to be quite frank
with you,

27:44.580 --> 27:46.331
it's come in useful
on a couple situations.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.667
Certainly, in the topsy-turvy
world of heavy rock,

27:49.752 --> 27:53.921
having a good solid piece of wood
in your hand is quite often useful.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.799
I miss you, too, darling.

27:56.967 --> 27:59.510
Um... Not too well,
actually.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.262
Well, we've got some
cancellations, that's all.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.514
We got to Memphis and
there's no gig in Memphis,

28:03.599 --> 28:06.309
and we find out this
promoter in the Midwest

28:06.393 --> 28:09.771
has pulled out
St. Louis and Kansas City

28:10.272 --> 28:13.733
and Des Moines.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.612
I don't know, it's in
Indiana or something.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.490
I thought...

28:21.533 --> 28:23.201
Don't tease me.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.495
That's not until
April. Great!

28:25.788 --> 28:28.414
We'll do it!
Oh, fucking great.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.126
Milwaukee.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.463
I have no idea. You might have
to take a plane to New York,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.299
and then go to
Milwaukee from there.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.054
Oh, God, I love you, too.
Okay, bye.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.099
(SIGHING IN RELIEF)

28:46.183 --> 28:47.475
Well, my problems
are solved, mate.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.559
Who's that?

28:48.644 --> 28:50.728
Was Jeanine, she's
gonna come meet us.

28:50.813 --> 28:55.400
She was supposed to do this window
layout for Neil Kite's boutique.

28:55.818 --> 28:56.901
But it's not
until April!

28:56.985 --> 28:59.362
Is she coming to drop some stuff
off? You know, and going right back?

28:59.446 --> 29:01.906
No, no. She's coming on her
own. She's gonna travel with us.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.408
She's gonna go on
the road with us.

29:03.492 --> 29:04.575
MAN: Turn it up.
Turn it up!

29:04.660 --> 29:07.036
She says she can hear that I'm
eating too much sugar on the phone.

29:07.121 --> 29:09.163
She says my larynx is fat.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.666
You might want
to come next door.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.627
The radio is playing
a bit of your past.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.672
You happy for me?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.173
(EXCLAIMING HAPPILY)

29:22.219 --> 29:23.469
I don't believe it!

29:23.554 --> 29:25.263
DAVID: (SINGING ON RADIO)
...cups and cakes

29:25.347 --> 29:29.100
I'm so full my tummy aches

29:29.184 --> 29:33.563
How sad it must end
But I'm glad I have a friend

29:33.647 --> 29:36.732
Sharing cups
and cakes with me

29:36.817 --> 29:40.445
And cakes with me

29:40.529 --> 29:42.113
MAN 1: Sounds good.
MAN 2: Yeah?

29:42.197 --> 29:43.281
MAN ON RADIO: Oh, yeah!

29:43.365 --> 29:46.284
Going all the way
back to 1965, that one.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.910
Doesn't it feel good?

29:47.995 --> 29:50.455
With The Thamesmen
and Cups and Cakes.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.539
DEREK: You're an oldie!

29:51.623 --> 29:54.333
Of course, The Thamesmen later
changed their name to Spinal Tap.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.793
They had a couple
of nice size hits.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.629
They're currently residing in
the "Where Are They Now" file.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.215
Johnny Q with you on Golden
106, and right after we...

30:01.300 --> 30:02.550
DEREK: Fuck you.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.845
DAVID: I'm not really sure
this was such a great idea.

30:05.929 --> 30:09.765
I mean, I don't feel any
better than I did at the hotel.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.978
He was going to do a TV special
from here, before he died.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.648
Yeah, that's right, the musical
version of Somebody Up There Likes Me.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.233
(DAVID SIGHS)

30:20.569 --> 30:23.571
DAVID: (SINGING)
Well, since my baby left me

30:23.655 --> 30:26.574
I found a new place to dwell

30:26.658 --> 30:29.410
Well, it's down at
the end of Lonely Street

30:29.495 --> 30:32.246
At Heartbreak Hotel

30:32.331 --> 30:33.956
Do it with the
harmony parts.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.082
All right.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.918
Well, since my baby left me...
Since my baby...

30:37.002 --> 30:38.836
The same key,
though, I think.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.756
Well, since my baby left me
Since my baby left me

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
If I'm going...

30:42.925 --> 30:44.342
Since my baby left me

30:44.426 --> 30:45.801
Left me

30:45.886 --> 30:46.844
Me

30:46.929 --> 30:47.929
No, you can't
hit that note.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.514
Since my...

30:49.598 --> 30:52.725
Since my baby left me
Since my baby left me

30:52.809 --> 30:56.187
Well, I found
a new place to dwell

30:56.271 --> 30:58.356
That's all right.
Not really, not really.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.107
Voice down.
Well, it sounds raga.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.234
You don't want to
go raga on this.

31:01.318 --> 31:02.610
No, not with this, it don't. It does.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.945
Well, since my baby left me

31:03.987 --> 31:05.905
It sounds fucking
barbershop. Don't... Hey.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.198
Barbershop raga.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.449
Watch the...
Watch the language.

31:08.492 --> 31:11.202
You're paying homage to
the King. A new hybrid.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.453
Sorry.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.706
DAVID: (SIGHING) This is
thoroughly depressing.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.292
It really puts perspective
on things, though, doesn't it?

31:18.377 --> 31:21.796
Too much. There's too much
fucking perspective now.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.840
In 1967, you...

31:24.925 --> 31:27.927
That was the first time
Spinal Tap came into existence.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.388
Well, the whole world was
changing in those days.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.681
And also we had
the world's ear...

31:31.765 --> 31:32.890
We were changing
the world.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.268
...because we had just released
an enormous-selling single.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.728
(Listen to the) Flower
People. Flower People.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.064
We toured the world,
we toured the States...

31:40.148 --> 31:41.691
DEREK: We toured the world
and elsewhere.

31:41.775 --> 31:42.984
It was a dream come true.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.694
(SINGING) Listen

31:44.778 --> 31:48.030
To what the flower people say

31:49.324 --> 31:51.284
(ALL VOCALIZING)

31:52.160 --> 31:58.082
Listen, it's getting
louder every day

32:01.169 --> 32:05.673
(SHUSHING) Listen, it's
like a bolt out of the blue

32:07.342 --> 32:09.510
(ALL VOCALIZING)

32:10.137 --> 32:15.182
Listen, it could be
calling now for you

32:18.937 --> 32:21.689
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:27.154 --> 32:28.571
(MOUTHING)

32:34.703 --> 32:37.538
MARTY: Now during the Flower
People period, who was your drummer?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.957
Stumpy's replacement,
Peter "James" Bond,

32:40.042 --> 32:42.960
he also died in
mysterious circumstances.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.086
We were playing a...

32:44.171 --> 32:45.129
Festival.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.756
...jazz-blues festival.
Where was that?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.716
NIGEL: Blues-jazz, really.
DEREK: Blues-jazz festival.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.302
It was the Isle...
It was in the Isle of...

32:51.386 --> 32:52.386
Isle of Lucy.
Isle of Lucy.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.305
The Isle of Lucy Jazz-Blues
Festival. Isle of Lucy.

32:54.389 --> 32:58.184
And it was tragic, really.
He exploded on stage.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.478
(DAVID SNAPS FINGERS)
DAVID: Just like that.

33:00.562 --> 33:01.604
DEREK: He just went up.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.315
He just was like a flash of green light,

33:05.275 --> 33:07.109
and that was it.
Nothing was left.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.694
DAVID: Look at his face.
Well, there was.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.820
It's true, this really
did happen. It's true.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.823
There was a little green
globule on his drum seat.

33:12.908 --> 33:13.908
DAVID: Like a
stain, really.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.785
NIGEL: It was more of a stain
than a globule, actually, and...

33:15.869 --> 33:18.120
You know, several... You
know, dozens of people

33:18.205 --> 33:20.539
spontaneously
combust each year.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.333
It's just not really widely reported.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.668
Right.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.878
(PLAYING)

33:25.962 --> 33:28.214
Testing.
Hello, hello.

33:28.298 --> 33:31.384
Test, test, test. This is mic
number one. This is mic number one.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.510
Isn't this
a lot of fun?

33:32.594 --> 33:34.428
Two, two.
Okay, got the mics.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.807
Let's do GSM,
all right? GSM.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.937
DAVID: (SINGING)
Stop wasting my time

33:44.523 --> 33:47.400
You know what I want

33:48.568 --> 33:51.445
You know what I need

33:52.239 --> 33:54.782
Or maybe you don't

33:56.952 --> 34:01.747
Do I have to come right smack
damn out and tell you everything?

34:01.832 --> 34:04.750
Gimme some money

34:05.877 --> 34:09.130
Gimme some money

34:09.214 --> 34:10.464
Oh, yeah!

34:16.138 --> 34:17.763
JEANINE: Hello, darling.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.434
Hello, I've got a
surprise for you.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.226
DAVID: Hey! Where'd
you come from?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.563
Where do you
think I came from?

34:25.647 --> 34:27.940
Bloody airplane,
didn't I? Right?

34:29.650 --> 34:30.900

David. David.

34:38.034 --> 34:42.246
JEANINE: Feels good. I've been wanting
to do that for the longest time.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.666
Want me to carry
you about with me?

34:45.751 --> 34:47.918
What's all this?
What? Tell me.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.043
That's the film crew.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.047
I told you about this.
It's the film crew. Martin?

34:52.132 --> 34:53.215
Hi, Martin.
This is Jeanine.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.759
Hello.
MARTY: Hello.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.428
Here it is! It's
Visitors' Day, isn't it?

34:57.512 --> 34:58.596
Here it is, lads!

34:58.680 --> 34:59.722
We better turn to...

34:59.806 --> 35:01.140
Smell the Glove,
me old beauties!

35:01.224 --> 35:02.266
MAN: Oh, really?

35:02.350 --> 35:03.392
Gather around.
Where's David?

35:03.477 --> 35:04.477
Come on, Ian,
you're kidding.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.771
David. David,
get up here!

35:06.855 --> 35:10.524
DEREK ON PA: David, Smell the
Glove is here. Hello, Jeanine.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.276
IAN: The moment we've all
been waiting for.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.944
I thought
I'd never see it.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.946
IAN: Here we go. I never
thought I'd live to see the day.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.656
Plenty for everybody.

35:17.741 --> 35:18.824
Wait a minute.
A little fanfare.

35:18.909 --> 35:19.950
What do you think?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.327
Is this the
test pressing?

35:21.411 --> 35:22.912
No, this is it.
Yes, that's right.

35:22.996 --> 35:24.580
This is Smell the Glove
by Spinal Tap?

35:24.664 --> 35:26.165
When you go to the store...
That's Smell the Glove.

35:26.249 --> 35:29.919
That's the jacket cover that's going
out across the country in every store.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.670
Is this the compromise you made? Yes.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.172
Is it going to say anything
here or along the spine?

35:33.215 --> 35:34.924
It doesn't even say anything?
It's not going to say anything.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.634
It's just going to be all
black? It's going to be that,

35:36.718 --> 35:39.261
simple, beautiful,
classic.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.055
Does look like, you know, black leather.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.182
You can see yourself
in both sides.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.809
DAVID: I wouldn't
feel so bad...

35:44.893 --> 35:46.644
DEREK: It's like a black
mirror. Yeah, it is.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.437
Well, I think it
looks like death.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.439
It looks like mourning.
I mean, it looks...

35:50.524 --> 35:53.317
David, David, every movie in
every cinema is about death.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.985
Death sells!

35:55.070 --> 35:56.779
I think he's right,
there's something about this

35:56.863 --> 36:00.658
that's so black, it's like, "How
much more black could this be?"

36:00.742 --> 36:04.328
And the answer is,
"None, none more black."

36:04.412 --> 36:06.664
I think you're, like,
rationalizing this whole thing

36:06.748 --> 36:09.750
into something that
you did on purpose.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.127
I think we're stuck
with a very, very stupid

36:12.212 --> 36:14.255
and a very
dismal-looking album.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.506
This is depressing!

36:15.590 --> 36:16.841
This is something you
wear around your arm,

36:16.925 --> 36:18.092
you don't put this on
your fucking turntable.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.260
NIGEL: David, it's a choice.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.679
I frankly think that this
is the turning point, okay?

36:21.763 --> 36:24.181
I think this is...
We're on our way now.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.600
It's time to kick ass!
DAVID: I agree, I agree.

39:08.930 --> 39:12.808
Given the history of Spinal
Tap drummers in the past,

39:12.892 --> 39:16.478
do you have any
fears for your life?

39:16.563 --> 39:18.689
When I did join, you know,
they did tell me.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.649
They kind of took
me aside and said,

39:20.734 --> 39:23.277
"Well, Mick, you know,
it's like this."

39:23.945 --> 39:26.321
And it did kind of
freak me out a bit,

39:26.406 --> 39:29.575
but it can't always
happen to... Can it?

39:29.659 --> 39:31.368
Right. Right.

39:31.453 --> 39:32.619
I mean, really.
The law of averages says...

39:32.704 --> 39:33.704
The law of averages.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.872
It says you will survive. Yeah.

Quite exciting. Quite
exciting, this computer magic.

have you destroyed, Viv?

I think. We're doing really five.

(GROUP EXCLAIMING)

40:01.691 --> 40:02.941
Can I take it off now?

40:03.026 --> 40:04.359
Why? Too hot in it?

40:04.444 --> 40:05.819
No, it's...

40:06.154 --> 40:07.362
I thought I might
go back to see

40:07.447 --> 40:09.239
what they were up to
back there, you know.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.741
Don't think they really
need to see this

40:10.825 --> 40:12.159

40:12.243 --> 40:15.079
Well, you were reading.
You can read here.

40:15.497 --> 40:19.500
Yeah, but they got the new game
back there. Thought I'd maybe...

40:20.085 --> 40:22.211
Thought I'd have a look at the new game.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.670
It's like
a submarine thing.

You've got all this
stuff all over you again.

DAVID: Before I met Jeanine, my
life was cosmically in shambles.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.929
It was... I was using
bits and pieces

40:32.013 --> 40:33.597
of whatever
Eastern philosophies

40:33.681 --> 40:35.808
happened to drift
through my transom.

40:35.892 --> 40:39.269
And she sort of sorted it out for
me, straightened it out for me.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.438
Gave me a path, you know,
a path to follow.

40:41.523 --> 40:45.275
MARTY: I wonder if you have as much
influence over his musical expression.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.444
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I listen to him

40:47.529 --> 40:49.613
when he's experimenting
and things like that.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.823
Don't I, doll?

40:50.907 --> 40:53.951
He plays things
to me sometimes

40:54.035 --> 40:58.247
when he's got a new bit that he
wants to tell me about, you know,

40:58.331 --> 41:00.249
and I say, "Yeah, that's
good," or, "That's bad,"

41:00.333 --> 41:01.792
or, "That's shit,"
or whatever.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.127
DAVID: (LAUGHING) Yeah.
JEANINE: You know.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.004
Yes, she's very honest,
she's brutally frank.

41:06.089 --> 41:07.965
MARTY: Well, how does that go
over with the other band members?

41:08.049 --> 41:09.633
I mean, you...

41:09.717 --> 41:12.553
Well, what happens is, she gives
me the brutally frank version,

41:12.637 --> 41:13.679
and I sort of tart
it up for them.

41:13.763 --> 41:14.763
Yeah.

41:14.848 --> 41:18.809
And of course it's so strange
because Nigel and Jeanine

41:18.893 --> 41:23.147
are so similar in so many
ways, but they just can't...

41:23.815 --> 41:25.649
They don't dislike
each other at all. No.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.025
There's a great love
between the two of them.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.318
Oh, yes.

41:28.403 --> 41:29.945
But there's some sort of communication

41:30.029 --> 41:32.865
that's just not... It's
just blocked or something.

with it for a few months now.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.346
Very delicate.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.682
It's a bit of
a departure

41:58.766 --> 42:01.143
from the kind of thing
you normally play.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.229
Yeah, well, it's part
of a trilogy, really,

42:04.314 --> 42:06.231
a musical trilogy
that I'm doing,

42:07.150 --> 42:10.444
in D minor,
which I always find

42:10.528 --> 42:12.529
is really the saddest
of all keys.

42:12.614 --> 42:15.866
Really. I don't know why, but it makes
people weep instantly, to play a...

You know, just simple
lines intertwining.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.506
You know, very much like... I'm
really influenced by Mozart and Bach,

42:31.591 --> 42:32.883
and it's sort of in
between, though,

42:32.967 --> 42:34.801
it's like a Mach
piece, really.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.803
What do you
call this?

No, but I've heard the album.

50:14.387 --> 50:16.846

it was mixed wrong.

I thought we needed a new presentation.
It's the signs of the zodiac.

51:08.149 --> 51:09.816
This is a look for Viv.
He's a Libra.

51:09.984 --> 51:11.693
There's the yin-yang...

51:11.777 --> 51:13.903
JEANINE: Yin and the yang.
DAVID:...sort of look.

51:13.988 --> 51:17.115
This is Nigel.
He's a Capricorn.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.409
Sort of a goat look. JEANINE:
We've given you a little beard.

51:19.493 --> 51:20.702
Is this a joke?

51:20.786 --> 51:21.911
DAVID: This is...

51:21.996 --> 51:23.747
Excuse me, is this a joke?

51:23.873 --> 51:25.665
DAVID: Just bear with us
for one moment, please.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.418
This, I love this.
I wish I were the Cancer.

51:28.586 --> 51:29.711
That's attractive.

51:29.795 --> 51:30.837
This is your crab face.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.213
Your brainchild, now.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.506
Give it a chance,
give it a chance.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.550
And this is David...
David's the lion.

51:35.634 --> 51:40.221
Please wait a minute. Have
you any idea what it will cost

51:41.515 --> 51:43.475
to dress up
the band as animals?

51:43.559 --> 51:44.726
Well, they're
not animals.

51:44.810 --> 51:45.894
They're signs of the zodiac.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.771
It's a way
to fight the drabs.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.606
You know,
we've got the drabs.

51:49.690 --> 51:52.734
That's true. I think mine
will look better in Doubly,

51:52.860 --> 51:54.527
if it was done in Doubly.

51:56.781 --> 51:57.989
I'm quite open-minded enough.

51:58.073 --> 51:59.282
DEREK: David.
No, no, David.

51:59.366 --> 52:02.118
You know, there are
solutions to our problems.

52:02.203 --> 52:03.203
I think we know
what they are.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.371
DAVID: I've yet to hear them.
I've yet to hear them.

52:05.456 --> 52:06.956
JEANINE: Since you're all
such geniuses...

52:07.041 --> 52:09.209
We take a rational approach,
we can say...

52:09.293 --> 52:11.211
May I make a suggestion?
I've got one other suggestion.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.754
DAVID: Let's hear yours.
Let's hear your suggestion.

52:12.838 --> 52:14.964
Stonehenge. Stonehenge.

52:15.883 --> 52:18.092
What about it? Best production
value we've ever had on stage.

52:18.177 --> 52:19.344
But we haven't
got the equipment.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.054
We haven't got Stonehenge.
Not yet we don't.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.473
Let's... Please,
please, just a moment.

52:23.557 --> 52:25.642
IAN: We know it works. NIGEL:
Musically, we all know it.

52:25.726 --> 52:26.810
IAN: I don't think
it's a bad idea.

52:26.894 --> 52:27.852
NIGEL: Musically,
we all know it, right?

52:27.937 --> 52:30.688
No problems musically.
We go right on stage,

52:30.773 --> 52:32.482
and it's quite simple.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.776
Ian can take care of this.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.736
DAVID: I know what the
Stonehenge monument looks like.

52:36.821 --> 52:38.571
We don't have that piece
of scenery anymore.

52:38.656 --> 52:40.907
NIGEL: I know,
so we build a new one.

52:42.243 --> 52:43.743
And this it.

52:43.911 --> 52:45.411
Consider it done.

52:46.372 --> 52:47.872
So, you're just gonna
take care of it like that?

52:47.957 --> 52:50.166
You're gonna find someone to
design it, using that as a plan?

52:50.251 --> 52:51.251
Let's try.
Let's try.

52:51.335 --> 52:52.418
If you can do it,
I'll do the number.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.172
Do you feel that,
in collaboration with David,

52:56.257 --> 53:00.718
that you are afforded the opportunity
to express yourself musically

53:00.803 --> 53:01.970
the way you would like to?

53:02.054 --> 53:04.305
Well, I think I do,
in my solos.

53:04.390 --> 53:05.974
My solos are
my trademark.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.410
(PLAYING SINGLE NOTE)

53:27.621 --> 53:29.247
(SOUND INTENSIFIES)

53:30.416 --> 53:32.125
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

53:51.979 --> 53:54.314
This looks absolutely
perfect. I mean, it's...

53:54.398 --> 53:56.399
It's the right proportions.
It'll be this color, eh?

53:56.859 --> 53:59.110
Yeah.
That's just terrific.

53:59.236 --> 54:02.071
I mean, it almost looks like
the real thing. You got it.

54:02.156 --> 54:05.116
Yeah. When we get the actual
set, when we get the piece,

54:05.200 --> 54:06.993
it'll follow exactly
these specifications,

54:07.119 --> 54:08.912
even these contours
and everything?

54:08.996 --> 54:12.749
I don't understand, Ian.
The actual piece?

54:12.833 --> 54:15.043
When you build
the actual piece.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.378
But this is what you
asked for, isn't it?

54:17.713 --> 54:18.838
What?

54:19.423 --> 54:20.506
Well, this is the piece.

54:20.591 --> 54:21.674
This is the piece?

54:22.134 --> 54:23.009
Yes.

54:23.093 --> 54:24.844
Are you telling
me that this is it?

54:25.846 --> 54:27.430
This is scenery?

54:27.765 --> 54:29.390
Have you ever
been to Stonehenge?

54:29.475 --> 54:30.683
No, I've never
been to Stonehenge.

54:30.809 --> 54:32.685
The triptychs
are 20-feet high!

54:32.811 --> 54:34.604
You can stand four men up them. Ian!

54:34.688 --> 54:36.648
I was asked to build it...
This is insane!

54:36.774 --> 54:38.816
This isn't a piece of scenery.
...18 inches high. Look, look.

54:38.901 --> 54:40.818
Look, this is what I
was asked to build.

54:40.903 --> 54:44.197
Eighteen inches. Right
here, it specified 18 inches.

54:44.865 --> 54:46.115
I was given this napkin.
I mean...

54:46.200 --> 54:47.200
Forget this!

54:47.284 --> 54:48.284
Fuck the napkin!

54:48.535 --> 54:50.328
(PLAYING STONEHENGE)

54:53.165 --> 54:55.625
(SINGING) In ancient times

54:57.336 --> 55:01.297
Hundreds of years
before the dawn of history

55:03.008 --> 55:05.718
Lived an ancient
race of people

55:08.722 --> 55:10.223
The Druids

55:19.817 --> 55:22.902
No one knows who they were

55:24.446 --> 55:28.116
Or what they were doing

55:30.327 --> 55:32.912
But their legacy remains

55:34.039 --> 55:40.962
Hewn into the living rock
of Stonehenge

55:53.392 --> 55:56.853
(SINGING) Stonehenge,
where the demons dwell

55:56.937 --> 56:00.523
Where the banshees live
and they do live well

56:00.983 --> 56:04.193
Stonehenge,
where a man's a man

56:04.278 --> 56:08.197
And the children
dance to the pipes of Pan

56:12.619 --> 56:17.540
And you, my love,
won't you take my hand?

56:19.168 --> 56:24.881
We'll go back in time
to that mystic land

56:27.051 --> 56:31.888
Where the dewdrops cry
and the cats meow

56:33.474 --> 56:35.975
I will take you there

56:36.602 --> 56:39.562
I will show you how

56:41.231 --> 56:42.982
(SCREAMING)

56:56.538 --> 57:02.376
And, oh, how they danced The
little children of Stonehenge

57:03.337 --> 57:06.714
Beneath the haunted moon

57:07.424 --> 57:14.013
For fear that daybreak
might come too soon

57:36.036 --> 57:38.955
DAVID: I do not, for one, think that
the problem was that the band was down.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.623
I think that
the problem may have been

57:40.707 --> 57:42.250
that there was
a Stonehenge monument

57:42.334 --> 57:46.129
on the stage that was in danger
of being crushed by a dwarf.

57:46.588 --> 57:50.550
All right? That tended to understate
the hugeness of the object.

57:50.634 --> 57:53.052
I really think you're just making
much too big a thing out of it.

57:53.137 --> 57:55.638
Making a big thing out of it
would have been a good idea.

57:55.722 --> 57:58.558
Nigel gave me a drawing that
said 18 inches, all right?

57:58.642 --> 58:00.017
I know he did, and that's
what I'm talking about.

58:00.102 --> 58:02.645
Whether he knows the difference between
feet and inches is not my problem.

58:02.729 --> 58:03.771
I do what I'm told.

58:03.856 --> 58:05.982
But you're not as
confused as him, are you?

58:06.066 --> 58:08.651
I mean, it's not your job to
be as confused as Nigel is.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.153
It's my job to do
what I'm asked to do

58:10.237 --> 58:12.029
by the creative
element of this band.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.281
And that's what I did.

58:13.365 --> 58:14.866
The audience were laughing.

58:14.992 --> 58:17.034
So it became a comedy
number. Yes, it did.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.162
Yes, it fucking well did,
and it was not pleasant

58:19.246 --> 58:20.997
to be part of
the comedy on stage.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.374
Backstage, perhaps
it was very amusing.

58:23.458 --> 58:27.086
Maybe we just fix the
choreography, keep the dwarf clear.

58:27.629 --> 58:30.173
DAVID: What do you mean?
So he won't trod upon it.

58:30.257 --> 58:31.716
I don't think
that's the issue.

58:31.800 --> 58:37.054
I think it's symptomatic that maybe
you're taking on more than you can handle.

58:37.806 --> 58:40.808
It's not exactly the first time
you've messed things up, is it?

58:40.893 --> 58:43.352
DAVID: I mean, there have
been some gaping holes

58:43.437 --> 58:44.437
in the business
end of this...

58:44.521 --> 58:45.688
IAN: Excuse me
for a minute, David.

58:45.772 --> 58:48.608
Excuse me, this is
a band meeting, right?

58:48.734 --> 58:50.568
Are you here for some reason?
DAVID: Don't worry about it.

58:50.652 --> 58:51.819
DAVID: She's with me.
JEANINE: Yeah.

58:51.904 --> 58:53.946
Is she now in the band?
Is she singing backup?

58:54.031 --> 58:56.407
JEANINE: I care what
happens to the band.

58:56.491 --> 58:59.869
David, whenever a single bump or a
ruffle comes into this little fantasy,

58:59.953 --> 59:03.164
adolescent fantasy world you
guys have built around yourself,

59:03.248 --> 59:06.709
you start screaming like a
bunch of poncey hairdressers.

59:06.793 --> 59:10.213
I mean, it's just a problem,
you know? It gets solved.

59:10.297 --> 59:12.381
JEANINE: It doesn't.
You can't live in a bubble.

59:12.466 --> 59:14.383
If it got solved,
that would be all right.

59:14.468 --> 59:15.760
But it doesn't get solved.

59:15.844 --> 59:18.221
What do you think happened out
there? What got solved tonight?

59:18.305 --> 59:21.724
The one thing that goes wrong,
one single thing goes wrong,

59:21.808 --> 59:23.184
100 things go right.

59:23.268 --> 59:25.228
Do you know what I spend
my time doing? What?

59:25.312 --> 59:27.313
I sleep two or
three hours a night.

59:27.439 --> 59:29.398
There's no sex and
drugs for Ian, David.

59:29.483 --> 59:31.776
You know what I do?
I find lost luggage.

59:31.860 --> 59:34.737
I locate mandolin strings
in the middle of Austin!

59:34.821 --> 59:37.740
I pries the rent out of the
local Hebrews. That's what I do.

59:37.824 --> 59:39.992
JEANINE: Maybe you should get
someone else to find the lost luggage,

59:40.077 --> 59:42.161
and you should concentrate
on what's going on onstage.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.621
DAVID: Yes! That's
what we're talking about.

59:43.664 --> 59:45.164
You'd like me to be the
road manager? All bad... No!

59:45.249 --> 59:47.208
All bad... Could we...

59:47.292 --> 59:51.337
What David's trying to say, if
you'll let him get a word through,

59:52.339 --> 59:54.966
is you could maybe
do with some help.

59:55.884 --> 59:58.219
Some help? It's very
simple, it's very simple.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.262
It's that clear.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.722
Maybe there's someone
already in the organization.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:02.974
We don't have
to pay insurance.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:04.809
We don't have to
pay extra room, et cetera.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.103
Since she's already here,
she's already among us,

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.521
and she can...
IAN: She?

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.773
She's perfectly capable
to taking over. She?

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.692
Wait a minute! Well, who do
you think I'm talking about?

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:14.777
Who do you think I'm talking
about? I would never have dreamed

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.612
in a million years, that it
was her you were talking about.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:17.780
Why not?

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.824
I am offering to help out.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:21.033
No, you're not
offering to help out.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.994
You're offering to co-manage
the band with me, is that it?

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.120
Yes.
Let's get it straight...

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.288
DAVID: In so many words,
that is exactly it.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.372
JEANINE: Exactly.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.457
Well, I'm certainly not going
to co-manage with some girl

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:29.625
just because
she's your girlfriend.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:30.960
His girlfriend, is it?
Don't call her my girlfriend.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.545
IAN: All right, she's not
your girlfriend. I don't know.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.963
You couldn't manage
a classroom full of kids.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.214
I don't know what you're
doing managing the band.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:36.757
DAVID: Why don't we just...
Shut up!

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.510
Look, look. I...
This is my position, okay?

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.053
I am not
managing it with you...

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.264
Good. ...or any other woman,
especially one who dresses

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.641
like an Australian's
nightmare. So, fuck you.

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:46.809
Well, fuck you, too.
Fuck all of you,

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.644
because I quit.
All right?

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:50.229
That's it.
Good night.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.488
(SIGHING)

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:02.408
DEREK: Can I raise a practical
question at this point?

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.909
DAVID: Yeah.

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:05.453
Are we gonna do
Stonehenge tomorrow?

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:08.706
No, we're not gonna
fucking do Stonehenge!

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.917
Okay, we're all set.
Thank you.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.295
All right, fellas,
I've got the tickets.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:17.715
We're on the 3:10 flight
at Gate 24.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:20.676
All right? And this
arrives at 4:00 in Colorado.

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:23.346
Then we got a limo
to take us to the lodge.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.349
DAVID: It's about 100 yards
from Rainbow Trout Studio.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:30.686
What I've done is to arrange
a whole load of charts.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:32.355
Wait till you see this.
This is so great.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:35.775
Now, I know that
the band's sign is Virgo

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.861
and, you see it,
Saturn's in the third house,

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.988
all right,
and it's a bit rocky.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:46.994
But because Virgo is one of the most
highly intelligent signs of the zodiac,

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:49.538
we're gonna pull through
this with great aplomb.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.248
Yeah. And has someone not got one?

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.042
It's so clear. Really is. Nigel
hasn't got one. Here you go.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.377
It's so clear.
Nigel.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:57.755
Nigel! I've got pages for
you. I think Nigel has one.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.465
DAVID: He's got one.
He's got it.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.549
JEANINE: If you have
a look at this...

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:03.177
If you think about the jumble
the tour book usually is...

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.345
No, he's got one.
He's got one.

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.471
He's got one?
All right.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.680
DAVID: And what's all this
on the...

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:08.766
JEANINE: Now, what I want to explain
to you here, is that Denver...

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:13.729
How would you characterize your
relationship with David over the years?

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:15.856
Has it changed in any way?

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.025
Not really. I mean, you know, they go...

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:19.819
We've grown up.

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:23.656
But, really, it's not...
No, not really.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:28.327
We feel like children much of
the time, even when we're playing.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.996
We're closer than brothers.

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.250
Brothers always fight.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:36.293
Sort of disagreements
and all that.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:41.841
We really have a relationship
that's way, way past that.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.053
(SCREAMING)

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:49.056
He can't play
the fucking guitar anymore.

01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:50.182
DEREK ON MIC:
You know the parts.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.559
You did it this morning.
No, he doesn't know the...

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:54.103
If he knew the fucking part,
he'd play it, wouldn't he?

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.563
That's it.
DAVID: Are you walking out?

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.064
Fuck. I'm not planning on walking out.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.315
Great.
Just tell me

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.525
what I'm supposed to do,
all right?

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.819
Well, we're supposed to play
the fucking thing, aren't we?

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.696
We have no choice.
We spent an hour and half...

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.114
Well, I'm doing my part.
...setting up this...

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.615
You know what would
make this a lot simpler?

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.909
I mean, I hate to
cut right to it here.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.578
Why don't you
play this alone,

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.496
without some fucking angel
hanging over your head,

01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:13.956
you know what I mean?

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.584
DEREK: Jesus Christ.
This is fucking all we need.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.628
You can't fucking concentrate
because of your fucking wife.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:20.838
Simple as that, all right?

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.006
It's your fucking wife.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.132
She's not my wife.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.633
Well, whatever the
fuck she is, all right?

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.093
You can't concentrate.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.928
We can't fucking do that
track. This is unbelievable.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.014
This is unbelievable. No,
it's not unbelievable at all.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.474
Will you check me on this?
It all leads up to this.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.309
Am I losing my fucking mind?
It all leads up to this.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.186
Can you check me on this?
Am I losing my mind?

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.189
I don't understand what
this has to do with anything.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.399
We're very lucky
in the sense that

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:42.985
we've got two visionaries
in the band.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:46.489
You know, David and Nigel
are both... MARTY: Right.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.324
...like poets, you know.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:50.534
Like Shelley or Byron
or people like that.

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:53.662
They're two totally distinct
types of visionaries.

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:56.165
It's like fire and ice,
basically, you see,

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.167
and I feel my role
is to, in the band,

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.752
is to be kind of
in the middle of that.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.754
Kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:12.181
Listen, I don't think we've
got time to go to the hotel.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:13.849
I think you better go
straight to the base.

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:14.975
DEREK: To the what?

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.393
VIV: Base?
The gig.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.187
Yeah, to the base. DEREK:
To the Civic Arena, right?

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.271
NIGEL: Yeah.
No!

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.481
No, that fell through.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:21.732
DEREK: We had it.
What do you mean?

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.150
Wait a second.
Hold it, hold it.

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:25.611
What do you... Do you know about
this and we don't know about this?

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.820
What are you talking about?

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:28.197
JEANINE: We're going
to the Air Force base.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:29.949
Why are we going
to an Air Force base?

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.451
'Cause the original gig
fell through.

You are Spinal Tarp?

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:43.712
I'm Jeanine Pettibone
and this is Spinal Tap.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.214

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.799
I'm Lieutenant
Bob Hookstratten.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.884
Welcome to Lindberg
Air Force Base.

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:51.428
Is this your gentlemen's first
visit to a military facility?

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.305
ALL: Yeah.
Fine, may I start by saying

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.057
how thrilled we are
to have you here?

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:56.809
We are such
fans of your music

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:58.602
and all of your records.
DAVID: That's great.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.271
I'm not speaking
of yours personally,

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:01.897
but the whole genre
of the rock 'n' roll.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:03.023
DAVID: I understand that.
JEANINE: Yeah.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:04.233
And so many of
the exciting things

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:05.359
that are happening
in music today.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:06.527
And let me explain a bit
about what's going on.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:09.488
This is our monthly
"at-ease weekend."

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.532
It gives us a chance
to kind of let down our hair.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:14.243
(LAUGHING) Although, I see you
all have a head start on that.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.787
These haircuts wouldn't pass
military muster, believe me.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.163
Although,
I shouldn't talk.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:19.498
My hair's getting
a little shaggy, too.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:20.749
Better not get
too close to you.

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:21.917
They'll think I'm
part of the band.

01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:23.210
I'm joking, of course.

01:05:23.295 --> 01:05:24.461
Shall we go in,
and I'll show you around?

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.881
HOOKSTRATTEN: Walk this way,
please. Right through here.

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:30.426
Did you ever run into a musical
group, works out of Kansas City,

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.386
calls himself Four
Jacks and a Jill?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.388
They've been at a Ramada Inn
there for about 18 months.

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:37.308
If you're ever in Kansas City and
you want to hear some good music,

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:39.435
you might want
to drop by.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.646
I would like to
get the playing on

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.357
about 19:00 hours if
that's satisfactory.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:46.859
When will that be?

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.445
I make it now,
it's about 18:30 hours.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:50.821
So, that's what?
50 hours?

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:52.197
120 hours?

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.158
That's actually
about 30 minutes.

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:55.534
About a half hour,
give or take just

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:56.869
a few minutes.
I don't want to rush you.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.955
The idea is if we can get it
on, then we get it over with.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040
And I have
just one request.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.334
Would you play a couple of
slow numbers so I can dance?

to sit at home and get monies.

Well, no, but it's...

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.590
You've got to
understand that, like,

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:35.551
in the world of
rock 'n' roll there are

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.928

have been in this

That's refreshing.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:56.881
I've got some of this
Mendocino Rocket Fuel

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.175
that's supposed
to be really nice.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:08:59.468
Can you play...

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:02.638
Excuse me, Viv.
Can you play a bass line

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.765
like Nigel used
to on Big Bottom?

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.015
Can you double that?
Yeah.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.600
You might recall the line,
it's in fifths.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.145
Oh yeah, I've got two
hands here. I can do it.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.647
DEREK: Great. So that's
good. We can play that one.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:12.898
DEREK: All right, that's it.
Hole is out.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.066
Heavy is out.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:16.068
DAVID: Heavy, Hole, Heavy, Hole...
Right, right, right. We know.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.903
America we know is out.
America we can't do.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:18.987
That's Nigel's tune.
That's not my tune.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:19.988
We know, we know.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.156
That's a nice
little set, isn't it?

01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:23.158
That's a cozy 10 minutes.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:24.660
DAVID: What we gonna do?
We got nothing to play here.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:25.828
We got nothing.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.078
DEREK: I'll tell you what
we're gonna have to do.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.287
What?

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.581
Jazz Odyssey.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:34.502
We're not going about to do
a free-form jazz exploration

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.296
in front of a festival crowd.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:42.928
You are witnesses at the new
birth of Spinal Tap Mark ll.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.058
Hope you enjoy
our new direction.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:12.499
On the bass, Derek Smalls.
He wrote this.

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:23.218
JOURNALIST: So, tonight's
the last show of the tour.

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:24.386
How's that feel?

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:26.054
You know, is this,
like, your last waltz?

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:27.764
Are we talking
the end of Spinal Tap?

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.433
Or are you going to
try to milk it for

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:31.059
a few more years
in Europe? I mean...

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:36.064
Well, I don't, I don't really
think that the end can be assessed,

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.484
as of itself,
as being the end,

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.153
because what does
the end feel like?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:44.948
It's like saying when you try and
extrapolate the end of the universe.

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:48.285
If you say the end... If the
universe is indeed infinite,

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:49.661
then how...
What does that mean?

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.747
How far is all the way?

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.457
And then if it stops,
what's stopping it,

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.125
and what's behind
what's stopping it?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.669
So, "What's the end,"
you know... Mmm-hmm.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:59.087
...is my question
to you.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.714
It's a good crowd.
Good crowd.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:01.924
It is, isn't it?

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.343
Yeah, it really is. I mean, you
know, some of these things just...

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.637
Well, it's hard to get at
the last minute, you know?

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:09.765
You can't arrange
it all overnight.

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.267
DEREK: David, we had
a 15-year ride, mate.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:15.062
I mean, who wants to be a fucking
45-year-old rock 'n' roller

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:17.648
farting around in front of
people less than half their age?

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:18.774
That is so true, yeah.

mediocre head-banging bullshit,

Yeah, well,
it's beneath us.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.238
That's right.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:26.782
Who wants to see it?
Absolutely right.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.241
Not me. I mean, you can
take all those projects

you know, we didn't...

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:31.119
Oh, there's dozens,
they're so...

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.664
You know, we didn't have
time for them because of Tap,

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.374
and bring them
back to life, maybe.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.917
Do you remember what we
were... Do you remember...

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:40.963
At the Luton Palace, we were
talking about a rock musical

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.297
based on the life
of Jack the Ripper.

01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:44.383
Yeah, Saucy Jack.
Right, Saucy Jack.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.467
Saucy Jack.
Now's the time to do that.

BOTH: (SINGING) You're
a naughty one, Saucy Jack

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.430
You're a haughty one,
Saucy Jack

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.265
Right. Bit of freeing up, isn't it?

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.309
It's all this free time is...
Suddenly, time is so elastic.

01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:56.645
It's a gift.
It's a gift of freedom.

collection of my acoustic numbers

should be envying us, you know.

in, huh? The last tuning.

time to go, right?

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.561
Can we go?

to hang around backstage,

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:12.679
like a real
rock 'n' roller?

you're doing?

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:41.500
He asked me
to ask you, Tap,

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:48.924
if you'd be interested in
reforming and doing a tour, Japan.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.384

of your...

you're going to set us...

Is that what
you're going to do?

01:13:58.559 --> 01:13:59.684
You gonna bring
us back to life?

here for? No, I've come...

'n' roll music keeps you a child?

That is, keeps you in a state
of arrested development?

No, no.
No, I feel it's like...

01:17:46.037 --> 01:17:49.622

national park or something,

is that moose, you know?

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:58.983
This is what you'd see.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.360
It wouldn't be
green, though.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:01.820
It is green.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.406
You know, see how
your blood looks blue?

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.782
Yeah, well,
that's just the vein,

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.242
I mean, the color
of the vein, I mean.

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:08.618
The blood is actually red.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.328
Oh, maybe
it's not green, then.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:12.455
Anyway, this is what I
sleep in sometimes. Yeah.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:14.707
MARTY: Denis Eton-Hogg,
the president

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.710
of Polymer Records,
was recently knighted.

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:21.256
What were the circumstances
surrounding his knighthood?

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.091
The specific reason
why he was knighted

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.510
was for the founding
of Hoggwood,

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.514
which is a summer camp
for pale young boys.

01:19:32.143 --> 01:19:33.560
MARTY: David St. Hubbins,

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:36.062
I must admit, I've never heard
of anybody with that name.

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.313
It's an unusual name.

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:38.773
Well, he was
an unusual saint.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:40.400
He's not a very
well-known saint.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:41.985
Oh, there actually is...
There was a St. Hubbins?

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:43.445
Oh, yes.
That's right, yes.

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:45.029
Yeah. What was he the saint of?

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:48.032
He was the patron saint
of quality footwear.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:52.871
You play to predominantly
a white audience.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.457
Do you feel your music
is racist in any way?

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.792
No, not at all.
No, of course not.

01:19:57.877 --> 01:20:00.295
You know, we say,
"Love your brother."

01:20:00.379 --> 01:20:01.671
We don't say it,
really, but...

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.423
We don't literally say
it. No, we don't say it.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.508
We don't really literally mean
it. We don't believe it either.

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.719
But we're not racists.
But...

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.220
That message
should be clear, anyway.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:10.680
We're anything
but racists.

01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:11.806
You know,
we've grown musically.

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.183
I mean, you listen
to some of the rubbish

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:15.477
we did early on, it
was stupid. MARTY: Yeah.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:18.104
You know, now, I mean,
a song like Sex Farm,

01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:21.107
we're taking
a sophisticated

01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:24.569
view of the idea of sex,
you know, and...

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.738
Putting it on a farm.
Yeah.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.282
MARTY: If I were to ask you
what your philosophy

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.910
of life or your creed,
what would that be?

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:38.166
Have a good time
all the time.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.128
That's my philosophy, Marty.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.339
I believe virtually
everything I read,

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:48.843
and I think that is what makes
me more of a selective human

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.012
than someone who doesn't
believe anything.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:54.390
Do you have a philosophy
or creed that you live by?

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:57.602
Well, you know, personally,
I like to think about

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.604
sex and drugs and
rock 'n' roll, you know.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.688
That's my life.
Yeah.

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:04.317
MARTY: If you were to have
something written as your epitaph...

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.946
"Here lies David St. Hubbins,

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.908
"and why not?"

01:21:14.245 --> 01:21:15.995
You feel that
sums up your...

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:18.164
No, it's the first thing I
could think of. Oh, I see.

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:19.582
It doesn't sum up
anything, really.

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:20.959
Yeah.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.795
I'm a real fish nut.
I really like fish.

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:25.630
MARTY: What kind of fish?

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:28.341
Well, in the United States,
you have cod.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:29.926
I like cod.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:32.720
And I love tuna, those
little cans you've got here.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.472
Tuna fish.
Yeah.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.349
No bones.
Yeah.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.433
(CHUCKLES)

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:41.896
MARTY: If you could not play
rock 'n' roll, what would you do?

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:44.065
I'd be a full-time dreamer.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:46.150
I'd probably get
a bit stupid and start

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:48.236
to make a fool of
myself in public,

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.655
'cause there wouldn't
be a stage to go on.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.907
Probably work with children.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:56.494
As long as there's, you know,
sex and drugs,

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.204
I can do without
the rock 'n' roll.

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:02.875
I suppose I could work
in a shop of some kind,

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.047
or do freelance selling
of some sort of product.

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:10.174
A salesman?
You think...

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.885
A salesman.
Maybe in a haberdasher.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:17.765
Or maybe like a
chapeau shop or something.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:22.270
You know, like, "Would you...
What size do you wear, sir?"

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.354
And then you answer me.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.939
Seven and a quarter.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.899
"I think we have that."

01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:29.068
See, something like
that, I could do. Yeah.

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:30.486
Do you think you'd be happy
doing something...

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:33.281
"No, we're all out.
Do you wear black?"

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:36.200
See, that sort of thing I think
I could probably muster up.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.245
Yeah. Do you think
you'd be happy doing that?

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.706
Well, I don't know.
What are the hours?
