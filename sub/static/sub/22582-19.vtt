00:03.807 --> 00:05.206
Bring in the prisoner.

00:21.247 --> 00:25.320
You stand accused of conspiring
against the Klingon Empire.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.446
How do you respond?

00:27.887 --> 00:29.081
I'm not guilty.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.961
When this tribunal
convenes tomorrow...

00:33.087 --> 00:35.760
you will be given a chance
to prove your innocence.

00:35.887 --> 00:39.562
If you cannot,
there is only one punishment.

00:53.047 --> 00:55.607
It's been a long road

00:56.807 --> 00:59.367
Gettin' from there to here

01:00.407 --> 01:03.205
It's been a long time

01:04.007 --> 01:07.477
But my time is finally near

01:07.967 --> 01:11.357
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:12.207 --> 01:15.040
I will touch the sky

01:15.487 --> 01:19.082
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:19.207 --> 01:22.199
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:22.327 --> 01:26.605
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:26.807 --> 01:29.844
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:29.967 --> 01:34.119
I've got faith to believe

01:34.247 --> 01:37.205
I can do anything

01:37.327 --> 01:41.002
I've got strength of the soul

01:41.687 --> 01:44.679
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:44.807 --> 01:48.959
I can reach any star

01:50.127 --> 01:52.118
I've got faith

01:54.007 --> 01:57.158
I've got faith

01:57.647 --> 02:00.923
Faith of the heart

02:34.047 --> 02:35.639
You have five minutes.

02:38.607 --> 02:40.882
- Glad you could drop by.
- How are you?

02:41.887 --> 02:43.206
I've been better.

02:43.647 --> 02:45.524
I wasn't sure if I'd find you alive.

02:45.727 --> 02:48.321
They promised me a trial
before the execution.

02:50.327 --> 02:51.362
Something wrong?

02:51.487 --> 02:54.081
Xenopolycythemia can be
highly contagious.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.846
I'm surprised they haven't put you
in isolation.

02:57.327 --> 03:00.603
Any residual symptoms?
Fever, dizziness?

03:00.767 --> 03:02.644
Just a scratchy throat.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.566
Let's have a look.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.525
- When did you get here?
- Two days ago.

03:10.647 --> 03:12.399
But they refused to let us see you.

03:12.727 --> 03:15.287
Enemies of the state
aren't allowed visitors.

03:15.527 --> 03:18.166
T'Pol was able to convince them
that your condition...

03:18.287 --> 03:20.323
necessitated a visit from your doctor.

03:20.447 --> 03:21.766
Very thoughtful of her.

03:21.887 --> 03:24.606
She sends her regards.
She assures you that Starfleet and...

03:24.727 --> 03:27.639
the Vulcan High Command are
doing everything to get you released.

03:27.767 --> 03:29.280
Are they having any luck?

03:29.447 --> 03:31.961
Not yet.
But she and Commander Tucker...

03:32.087 --> 03:35.284
have begun exploring other options
for regaining your freedom.

03:38.727 --> 03:40.399
When this is over...

03:41.287 --> 03:43.118
whatever the outcome...

03:43.807 --> 03:47.197
I'm counting on them to get Enterprise
safely out of Klingon territory.

03:48.327 --> 03:49.885
I'll let them know.

03:52.447 --> 03:54.597
How are your accommodations?

03:55.927 --> 03:57.155
Not so bad.

03:58.047 --> 04:00.720
Can't say I'm a big fan
of Klingon cuisine.

04:00.847 --> 04:04.396
It may not appear appetising, but it
seems like a good source of protein.

04:04.527 --> 04:06.279
I suggest you eat it.

04:08.847 --> 04:10.166
Is he infectious?

04:10.287 --> 04:11.720
I don't believe so.

04:11.847 --> 04:14.407
- Then return to your ship.
- I'd like to run more tests.

04:14.527 --> 04:16.324
You're not here to treat him.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.165
Thanks for the house call, Doc.

04:23.287 --> 04:25.084
I'm sure I'll see you soon.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.361
I'm Kolos, your advocate.

04:31.047 --> 04:32.400
Jonathan Archer.

04:33.887 --> 04:35.764
The tribunal's about to begin.

04:35.887 --> 04:37.559
We haven't even discussed
what happened.

04:37.687 --> 04:39.359
I'm familiar with the charges.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.796
Well, I'm not familiar
with your justice system.

04:42.447 --> 04:44.119
What can I expect out there?

04:44.887 --> 04:46.240
Now that you've been charged...

04:46.367 --> 04:48.642
the evidence against you
will be presented.

04:48.807 --> 04:50.638
Do I get a chance to testify?

04:51.647 --> 04:53.842
I will conduct your defence.

04:54.767 --> 04:57.361
How can you do that when
you haven't heard what happened?

04:57.487 --> 04:59.557
I know what happened.

05:00.407 --> 05:02.921
You mustn't speak during the tribunal.

05:03.047 --> 05:04.400
I'll speak for you.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.086
What are they saying?

05:27.887 --> 05:29.081
"Enemy."

05:30.247 --> 05:32.124
I hope they're not the jury.

05:32.247 --> 05:33.919
There is no jury.

05:44.687 --> 05:47.485
- Who's that?
- Prosecutor Orak.

05:48.367 --> 05:50.164
His success is well-known.

05:50.807 --> 05:52.126
What about you?

05:53.087 --> 05:54.566
What's your success rate?

05:56.407 --> 05:58.159
I've performed my duty.

06:07.927 --> 06:10.157
This tribunal is convened.

06:10.407 --> 06:12.079
Strength to the Empire.

06:12.967 --> 06:15.003
Prosecutor Orak, you may proceed.

06:15.887 --> 06:18.276
I call Duras, son of Toral.

06:24.247 --> 06:28.160
Captain Duras, tell the tribunal
about your encounter with the accused.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.039
I am no longer a captain.

06:30.767 --> 06:31.961
Explain.

06:32.127 --> 06:34.277
I am a second weapons officer...

06:34.407 --> 06:37.444
serving on the Ty'Gokor
defence perimeter.

06:37.767 --> 06:41.840
The Duras I called to testify is
commander of the battle cruiser Bortas.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.920
I was recently reduced in rank.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.642
A distinguished Klingon warrior...

06:48.847 --> 06:51.236
stripped of his command.

06:51.847 --> 06:55.283
Did the accused have anything to do
with your disgrace?

06:55.407 --> 06:56.442
Yes.

06:57.007 --> 07:00.158
Go on, Weapons Officer Duras.

07:01.727 --> 07:05.606
A group of rebels had fled the Klingon
protectorate at Raatooras.

07:05.727 --> 07:08.480
I was commanded
to bring these traitors to justice.

07:08.807 --> 07:13.517
We'd followed their warp trail to
a system just outside Klingon territory.

07:13.847 --> 07:17.078
They're near the fifth planet.
Another vessel has docked with them.

07:17.207 --> 07:18.242
Show me.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.202
What kind of ship is that?

07:22.327 --> 07:24.795
Unknown.
But they've taken the rebels aboard.

07:25.247 --> 07:26.600
Armaments?

07:26.727 --> 07:30.003
Torpedo launchers fore and aft.
Low-yield particle cannons.

07:30.127 --> 07:31.879
We can defeat them easily.

07:32.127 --> 07:33.401
Intercept.

07:34.407 --> 07:36.363
- They're signalling us.
- Viewer.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.166
Identify yourself.

07:39.967 --> 07:42.561
Captain Archer
of the battle cruiser Enterprise.

07:42.687 --> 07:44.882
The people aboard your ship
are wanted for treason.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.838
Surrender them immediately.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.241
By whose authority?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.483
The Chancellor
of the Klingon High Council.

07:50.607 --> 07:53.724
I don't know your chancellor,
and I don't give a damn what he wants.

07:53.847 --> 07:57.203
I've formed an alliance with these
people, and I'll support their revolt.

07:57.327 --> 08:00.319
Give them to me now,
or I'll destroy your vessel.

08:01.007 --> 08:04.682
Fire one shot, and you'll be joining
your ancestors in the afterlife.

08:05.367 --> 08:08.518
He refused to surrender the rebels?

08:08.887 --> 08:09.876
Yes.

08:10.247 --> 08:13.125
I didn't say any of those things.
Can't you object?

08:13.807 --> 08:15.286
It's not important.

08:15.727 --> 08:18.878
And how did you respond
to Archer's defiance?

08:19.767 --> 08:21.041
I pitied him.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.637
He was about to die
in defence of these wretched traitors.

08:24.767 --> 08:25.995
They weren't traitors.

08:27.287 --> 08:31.280
Advocate, haven't you informed
the prisoner of the rules of this tribunal?

08:31.407 --> 08:33.398
My apologies, Magistrate.

08:33.727 --> 08:36.366
Be silent, or you will be removed.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.075
Continue.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.445
I showed him more patience
than he deserved.

08:41.607 --> 08:44.997
But obviously,
he wanted blood to be spilled.

08:45.247 --> 08:49.957
Don't be a fool. Your ship is inferior.
You won't survive a battle with us.

08:50.087 --> 08:52.078
Death to the Empire.

08:55.047 --> 08:56.400
Return fire!

09:03.967 --> 09:05.719
They're heading for the ring system!

09:05.847 --> 09:08.805
The coward thinks he can hide.
Pursue them!

09:21.567 --> 09:23.080
Where are they?

09:23.767 --> 09:26.600
- Answer me!
- Debris is interfering with sensors.

09:30.127 --> 09:32.846
There. Target their engines!
All weapons!

09:56.127 --> 09:58.322
We've lost sensors. Shields are down!

09:58.447 --> 10:00.244
Manual targeting! Fire!

10:08.207 --> 10:09.435
They're leaving orbit.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.682
Follow them!

10:11.167 --> 10:12.646
Our engines are down.

10:15.167 --> 10:18.398
It took us three hours to repair
our warp drive.

10:18.847 --> 10:21.042
But, of course, by that time,
they were gone.

10:21.807 --> 10:25.197
You're fortunate your first officer
didn't kill you for such a failure.

10:25.327 --> 10:26.680
You're dismissed.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.679
You're not going to question him?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.844
He'd say nothing that would help you.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.720
Do you have any further
evidence to present?

10:39.847 --> 10:41.519
No, Magistrate.

10:42.527 --> 10:44.518
Duras' testimony is clear.

10:44.647 --> 10:47.115
He was attempting to carry out
his mission...

10:47.807 --> 10:51.561
to bring enemies of the Empire
to justice.

10:51.807 --> 10:55.117
But this aggressor, this human...

10:55.607 --> 10:58.804
conspired with them to disgrace
a proud warrior...

10:58.927 --> 11:00.645
and foment rebellion!

11:00.767 --> 11:04.555
There can be no doubt
that he is our enemy as well!

11:07.047 --> 11:10.039
Captain Archer claims to be innocent.

11:10.487 --> 11:11.840
Innocent of what?

11:15.407 --> 11:18.319
This tribunal has already been
far too lenient.

11:19.167 --> 11:22.318
We haven't accused his crew,
or his government.

11:22.527 --> 11:26.566
He's fortunate we haven't dispatched
a fleet of warships to his homeworld.

11:26.847 --> 11:29.122
But we do demand
that he be held responsible...

11:29.247 --> 11:30.965
for the crimes he has committed.

11:31.087 --> 11:34.363
We demand that he receive
the most severe punishment...

11:34.487 --> 11:36.125
our laws decree!

11:53.967 --> 11:55.525
Do you have a response?

11:56.247 --> 11:57.726
No, Magistrate.

11:58.287 --> 12:01.324
Then I will consider the evidence
and deliver my verdict...

12:01.447 --> 12:03.278
I'd like a chance to defend myself.

12:03.407 --> 12:04.726
You have been warned.

12:04.847 --> 12:05.916
He's distorting the truth.

12:06.047 --> 12:07.002
Be silent!

12:07.127 --> 12:10.483
Those people weren't rebels.
And I wasn't trying to start a rebellion.

12:10.927 --> 12:12.519
I am not your enemy!

12:17.287 --> 12:19.596
This tribunal is in recess.

12:55.767 --> 12:58.440
- What is this?
- Targ.

12:59.287 --> 13:00.640
It's a little underdone.

13:02.047 --> 13:04.925
I told you to remain silent.
You should have listened to me.

13:05.287 --> 13:07.960
Sorry if I interfered
with your legal strategy.

13:08.327 --> 13:10.636
My strategy may yet spare your life.

13:11.047 --> 13:12.446
I've spoken with the magistrate.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.717
He's willing to show mercy
if you cooperate.

13:14.847 --> 13:17.964
- How?
- Tell him where to find the rebels.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.679
I told you, they're not rebels.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.559
It doesn't matter what you believe.

13:22.687 --> 13:24.484
They're subject to
the laws of the Empire.

13:24.607 --> 13:26.006
Nothing you say can change that.

13:26.127 --> 13:28.516
I haven't been able to say anything.

13:30.327 --> 13:31.840
Where did you take them?

13:32.487 --> 13:35.081
Another ship? A planet?

13:36.727 --> 13:39.799
Do you understand what will happen
if you don't tell them?

13:40.407 --> 13:42.045
I have a pretty good idea.

13:42.167 --> 13:44.806
I'm offering you a way to save your life.

13:47.647 --> 13:49.444
Let's say I did cooperate.

13:50.647 --> 13:52.365
What would happen to these people?

13:52.487 --> 13:55.365
They would be charged with treason.

13:55.847 --> 13:57.838
And end up in a court like this one?

14:01.127 --> 14:03.641
Tell the magistrate
I'm going to pass on his offer.

14:06.287 --> 14:09.723
Only a fool would sacrifice himself
for people he barely knows.

14:09.847 --> 14:11.485
I know them well enough.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.560
They're good people,
and I won't turn them over.

14:14.847 --> 14:17.759
If you'd let me testify,
tell my side of the story...

14:17.887 --> 14:19.843
it might become clear
why I helped them.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.082
But from what I've seen...

14:21.207 --> 14:24.199
you're all perfectly happy to ignore
what you don't want to hear.

14:24.327 --> 14:28.445
Don't be so quick to accuse me of
sharing their interpretation of the law.

14:28.567 --> 14:29.682
No?

14:30.767 --> 14:32.564
What's your interpretation?

14:32.687 --> 14:35.281
I became an advocate many years ago.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.079
They were different times.

14:40.127 --> 14:41.526
Better or worse?

14:41.727 --> 14:43.877
The courts were more willing to listen.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.000
Then maybe...

14:47.127 --> 14:49.880
you should remind them
of those different times.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.722
Nothing like a good history lesson.

14:57.487 --> 14:58.920
I'm an old man.

14:59.647 --> 15:01.797
Too old to challenge the rules.

15:01.927 --> 15:04.077
Even if your client's life depends on it?

15:05.727 --> 15:08.321
I get the feeling
you're as frustrated as I am.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.003
And you want to stand up to them.

15:11.967 --> 15:14.640
But you've given up.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.681
- You're afraid of them.
- I'm not afraid.

15:17.807 --> 15:20.321
Then prove it. Challenge them.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.123
Show them what a real trial is like.

15:47.487 --> 15:49.318
Strength to the Empire.

15:51.487 --> 15:53.762
Have you informed the accused
of our offer?

15:53.887 --> 15:54.922
I have.

15:55.047 --> 15:57.277
And does he wish
to address this tribunal?

15:57.407 --> 15:58.681
He does.

15:59.047 --> 16:01.242
He wishes to testify in his own defence.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.200
I object. The time for testimony is over.

16:04.327 --> 16:07.080
With respect, Magistrate,
no verdict has been reached.

16:07.207 --> 16:09.767
Irrelevant! I urge you to end
these proceedings.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.640
I'm within my rights
to present further testimony.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.997
You're speaking of archaic rights.

16:15.247 --> 16:17.715
Surely I don't need to remind
the magistrate...

16:17.847 --> 16:20.042
the judicial charter of Koloth states...

16:20.207 --> 16:23.279
an advocate is entitled
to challenge the charges at any point...

16:23.407 --> 16:24.840
during the tribunal.

16:24.967 --> 16:28.437
To my knowledge,
that charter has not been cast aside.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.964
From the time of Kahless...

16:31.287 --> 16:34.324
our courts have stood as a forum...

16:34.607 --> 16:37.041
where justice is dispensed with honour!

16:39.047 --> 16:42.517
Now, will my case be heard,
or will it not?

16:44.727 --> 16:46.080
Call your witness.

16:56.487 --> 16:57.966
Identify yourself.

16:58.287 --> 17:01.757
I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of
the Earth Starship Enterprise.

17:01.887 --> 17:04.162
Do you admit, Captain Archer...

17:04.287 --> 17:07.597
that you gave aid and comfort
to a vessel fleeing the Empire?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.319
We answered a distress call.

17:10.567 --> 17:13.001
They were starving.
Their life support was failing.

17:13.127 --> 17:16.836
Their health isn't at issue here.
You helped them to escape!

17:16.967 --> 17:20.164
Will my client be allowed
to testify or not?

17:20.327 --> 17:24.923
Prosecutor, you will show the advocate
the same respect he has shown you.

17:26.007 --> 17:27.087
Continue.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.878
Recount for this tribunal
your recollection of the events.

17:32.327 --> 17:35.444
As I said,
we had received a distress call.

17:36.487 --> 17:37.636
Magnify.

17:39.087 --> 17:41.555
- Bio-signs?
- Twenty-seven.

17:44.407 --> 17:47.683
- Any response?
- No, sir.

17:51.727 --> 17:52.842
Malcolm?

17:52.967 --> 17:56.243
Main propulsion's off-line,
life support is failing.

17:57.087 --> 17:58.645
They're in a bad way, sir.

18:01.527 --> 18:02.846
Can you dock with them?

18:03.367 --> 18:05.756
Their port engine is venting
reactor coolant.

18:06.727 --> 18:09.924
I can try to come in
on the starboard side, but it'll be tricky.

18:11.527 --> 18:12.596
Do your best.

18:16.127 --> 18:18.800
Our warp drive failed
three weeks after we left.

18:19.327 --> 18:22.205
We tried to set a course
for the nearest system at impulse...

18:22.327 --> 18:23.806
but main power went down.

18:24.527 --> 18:25.880
How long ago was that?

18:26.087 --> 18:28.647
I don't know. Six weeks.

18:28.887 --> 18:30.115
Maybe more.

18:30.727 --> 18:34.402
We diverted auxiliary power
to life support, but it wasn't enough.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.638
Food processors failed...

18:37.007 --> 18:38.440
water recyclers...

18:38.567 --> 18:40.603
I've put them all
on protein supplements...

18:40.727 --> 18:42.718
but two of them are in serious condition.

18:43.007 --> 18:45.601
When we left, there were 54 aboard.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.359
What brought you out here?

18:49.807 --> 18:53.482
Several years ago,
our colony was annexed...

18:53.687 --> 18:55.996
by a species we had never seen before.

18:56.687 --> 18:59.724
They said they'd provide for us
in exchange for our allegiance...

18:59.847 --> 19:02.315
that we become a part of their empire.

19:02.447 --> 19:05.564
But they stripped us of our resources,
left us with nothing.

19:06.127 --> 19:07.958
We waited for them to return.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.442
They said they'd bring food, fuel.

19:12.607 --> 19:14.086
They never came back.

19:14.807 --> 19:17.367
You knew they were fleeing the Empire.

19:17.847 --> 19:20.077
We knew that their colony
had been abandoned.

19:20.447 --> 19:23.120
And you chose
to show them compassion?

19:23.247 --> 19:24.646
They were starving.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.485
They wouldn't have lasted
another week.

19:26.607 --> 19:30.441
They were subjects of the Empire.
Their welfare was not your concern.

19:30.607 --> 19:32.563
Apparently it wasn't yours, either.

19:33.687 --> 19:36.599
You see the contempt
these humans have for us?

19:36.807 --> 19:38.923
He still believes he did nothing wrong.

19:39.207 --> 19:42.722
And Prosecutor Orak has yet to prove
that he has.

19:42.887 --> 19:44.445
He aided these rebels...

19:44.567 --> 19:47.798
and now he refuses to help us
bring them to justice!

19:57.127 --> 19:59.766
I will hear what the accused has to say.

20:01.647 --> 20:02.647
Continue.

20:03.407 --> 20:07.036
My chief engineer had determined
that their vessel was beyond repair.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.763
Some of the crew'll have to double up,
but we can accommodate them all.

20:11.247 --> 20:12.805
I've already given the order.

20:14.607 --> 20:17.201
Considering the alternative
was to set the ship adrift...

20:17.327 --> 20:19.363
I anticipated your decision.

20:20.967 --> 20:22.605
Where do you plan to take them?

20:22.727 --> 20:25.195
They were headed for a system
a few light-years away.

20:25.327 --> 20:27.124
That'll keep them safe
from the Klingons.

20:27.247 --> 20:29.044
Empires tend to expand.

20:29.167 --> 20:32.079
They may eventually discover
they haven't travelled far enough.

20:32.207 --> 20:34.562
Captain, please report to the Bridge.

20:43.487 --> 20:45.955
Looks like they didn't abandon
the colonists after all.

20:46.087 --> 20:48.362
Perhaps they're bringing
the supplies they promised.

20:48.487 --> 20:51.445
It's a D-5 battle cruiser.
I doubt it's bringing supplies.

20:52.687 --> 20:54.405
How long before they get here?

20:54.967 --> 20:56.446
Seventeen minutes.

20:57.127 --> 20:59.402
- Are all the refugees aboard?
- Yes, sir.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.366
Cut their ship loose,
and go to tactical alert.

21:05.767 --> 21:08.804
So, you were preparing for battle.

21:09.007 --> 21:10.884
I was preparing to defend my ship.

21:11.007 --> 21:13.475
As any good Klingon commander
would be.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.916
The accused already admitted
he knew the rebels...

21:16.047 --> 21:17.400
were subjects of the Empire.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.483
They may have been
subjects of the Empire...

21:19.607 --> 21:21.598
but it sure as hell looked like
you'd abandoned them.

21:21.727 --> 21:24.400
And he knew the Bortas
was coming to retrieve them.

21:24.527 --> 21:28.202
Yet he launched a deliberate attack
against an lmperial vessel.

21:28.327 --> 21:31.842
This human is guilty of more than
inciting rebellion.

21:32.407 --> 21:34.602
He has committed an act of war!

21:47.127 --> 21:49.402
I don't suppose there's a chance of
outrunning them.

21:49.527 --> 21:51.324
Their maximum speed is warp 6.

21:51.447 --> 21:53.324
If we could disable their engines.

21:53.447 --> 21:56.757
Sustained fire from our phase-cannons
should penetrate their armour...

21:57.127 --> 22:00.085
but I doubt they'd sit still
long enough to give us the chance.

22:00.207 --> 22:02.118
What's the composition of those rings?

22:06.767 --> 22:07.882
Nothing unusual.

22:08.007 --> 22:11.443
Methane ice, isolytic plasma,
diamagnetic dust.

22:11.727 --> 22:14.321
When we pulled that Klingon ship
out of the gas giant...

22:14.447 --> 22:16.244
did you get a look at their sensor array?

22:16.367 --> 22:19.962
Pretty standard multi-spectral sensors.
Not too different from ours.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.642
If we could ignite the plasma
in those rings...

22:23.767 --> 22:25.405
would it disrupt their sensors?

22:25.767 --> 22:27.166
For a few seconds.

22:27.287 --> 22:28.879
A few seconds will have to do.

22:29.247 --> 22:30.726
Can you modify a torpedo?

22:30.847 --> 22:32.075
- I believe so.
- How long?

22:32.207 --> 22:33.401
How long do I have?

22:33.527 --> 22:35.995
The Klingon ship will be here
in less than 11 minutes.

22:36.127 --> 22:37.242
Get moving.

22:38.127 --> 22:41.403
So, you laid a trap for the Bortas?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.245
We had no intention of firing first.

22:44.087 --> 22:45.679
Such a noble human.

22:45.807 --> 22:50.005
I was assured the accused would be
allowed to speak without interruption.

22:50.127 --> 22:53.324
By all means.
I find his version of events...

22:53.567 --> 22:56.001
extremely entertaining.

23:00.407 --> 23:04.241
The Bortas had dropped out of warp
with their weapons charged.

23:05.167 --> 23:06.725
They're on an intercept course.

23:06.847 --> 23:08.678
200,000 kilometres and closing.

23:12.847 --> 23:14.075
Hail them.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.123
Identify yourself!

23:17.367 --> 23:20.086
I'm Jonathan Archer,
Captain of the Starship Enterprise.

23:20.207 --> 23:23.483
You're harbouring fugitives.
Surrender them!

23:23.687 --> 23:25.643
I wasn't aware
they'd committed any crime.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.917
They're wanted for inciting rebellion.

23:28.887 --> 23:32.197
From what I can tell, they are in
no condition to incite anything.

23:33.167 --> 23:35.203
Apparently,
their colony was abandoned by...

23:35.327 --> 23:37.557
Turn over the rebels, now!

23:39.367 --> 23:40.846
What do you intend to do with them?

23:40.967 --> 23:42.639
That's none of your concern.

23:43.647 --> 23:47.799
I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to hand
them over without more information.

23:48.087 --> 23:50.157
If I could speak to someone
in your government.

23:50.287 --> 23:52.437
I speak for the Empire!

23:54.047 --> 23:57.198
Fair enough. Let's sit down and try to...

24:04.967 --> 24:06.719
Hull plating is at 80%.

24:06.847 --> 24:08.326
No damage to the Klingon ship.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.641
Head into the rings.

24:09.767 --> 24:12.235
They're pursuing. 10,000 metres.

24:17.527 --> 24:20.360
We're approaching a large fragment,
600 metres in diameter.

24:20.487 --> 24:22.637
Bearing 2-2-7, Mark 4.

24:24.407 --> 24:25.442
Put us behind it.

24:29.647 --> 24:33.162
- They're closing, sir. 4,000 metres.
- Stand by.

24:34.287 --> 24:37.199
3,000 metres. 2,000.

24:39.967 --> 24:41.719
- 800 metres.
- Fire!

24:52.647 --> 24:53.762
Our sensors are down.

24:53.887 --> 24:56.640
Let's hope theirs are, too.
Get us out of here.

24:58.087 --> 25:00.885
- You say the Bortas fired first?
- Yes.

25:01.407 --> 25:05.116
And you tried to reach
an accommodation with Captain Duras?

25:05.367 --> 25:06.516
He refused.

25:06.647 --> 25:10.322
Duras was under no obligation
to accommodate this human.

25:10.447 --> 25:13.200
You were defending your ship
when you attacked the Bortas?

25:13.327 --> 25:15.283
- Yes.
- And then what happened?

25:15.887 --> 25:18.560
We left the system
and took the refugees with us.

25:19.007 --> 25:21.805
You could have destroyed the Bortas.

25:22.327 --> 25:23.521
Why didn't you?

25:23.927 --> 25:26.157
Because Captain Duras
is not my enemy.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.925
Not your enemy.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.437
I submit to this tribunal...

25:36.087 --> 25:38.521
that Captain Archer is guilty.

25:44.287 --> 25:48.166
Guilty of meddling in Klingon affairs
on more than one occasion.

25:48.407 --> 25:51.877
In fact, I've discovered his name
is well known to the High Council.

25:52.247 --> 25:55.523
The accused once stood before
the Chancellor himself...

25:55.647 --> 25:59.481
and exposed a Suliban plot that would
have thrown the Empire into civil war.

26:00.047 --> 26:01.560
That is absurd.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.917
The facts are on record.

26:04.967 --> 26:08.403
Perhaps the prosecutor has grown
complacent with his research.

26:10.567 --> 26:13.957
The records of the lmperial Fleet
also mention this man.

26:14.247 --> 26:18.445
His ship was instrumental in the rescue
of the Klingon Raptor, the Somraw...

26:18.727 --> 26:21.116
from the dense atmosphere
of a gas giant.

26:21.407 --> 26:24.479
Even if this is true,
it has nothing to do with this case!

26:24.807 --> 26:27.162
It has everything to do with this case.

26:27.527 --> 26:30.200
It shows a pattern
in Archer's behaviour...

26:30.407 --> 26:33.240
that was repeated
in his encounter with Captain Duras.

26:33.367 --> 26:36.837
Yes, he may be self-righteous...

26:37.447 --> 26:40.007
but his meddling has saved
a Klingon ship...

26:40.247 --> 26:42.761
and perhaps
the fate of the Empire itself.

26:43.527 --> 26:45.757
If Captain Archer is guilty...

26:45.927 --> 26:48.999
he is guilty of nothing more than
being a nuisance...

26:49.407 --> 26:52.001
and hardly worth the attention
of this tribunal.

26:52.847 --> 26:54.644
And if he must be punished...

26:55.607 --> 26:57.802
let the punishment fit that crime.

27:02.367 --> 27:04.244
How long should it take for a verdict?

27:05.407 --> 27:07.637
It usually doesn't take long at all.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.916
I must have been more persuasive
than I thought.

27:14.607 --> 27:17.485
Thanks for what you've done for me.

27:18.527 --> 27:19.880
Don't thank me yet.

27:20.087 --> 27:22.840
The odds are still very much against us.

27:27.887 --> 27:29.843
- What is it?
- Bloodwine.

27:30.927 --> 27:32.997
It should help make the wait
more pleasant.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.760
What's it the blood of?

27:43.767 --> 27:46.281
Don't feel badly if you can't stomach it.

27:48.327 --> 27:49.646
I didn't say that.

28:00.767 --> 28:02.564
How many cases have you won?

28:04.047 --> 28:07.517
I'm not sure. Over 200.

28:08.607 --> 28:10.677
But that was a long time ago...

28:10.927 --> 28:13.077
when the tribunal was a forum
for the truth...

28:13.207 --> 28:16.040
and not a tool for the warrior class.

28:19.287 --> 28:21.323
There are other classes?

28:22.487 --> 28:25.240
You didn't believe all Klingons
were soldiers?

28:27.567 --> 28:28.795
I guess I did.

28:30.767 --> 28:33.804
My father was a teacher.

28:35.007 --> 28:37.680
My mother, a biologist at the university.

28:38.607 --> 28:41.599
They encouraged me to take up the law.

28:43.207 --> 28:44.276
Now...

28:45.367 --> 28:48.643
all young people want to do
is take up weapons...

28:48.767 --> 28:50.564
as soon as they can hold them.

28:50.927 --> 28:53.566
They're told there's honour in victory.

28:54.247 --> 28:55.521
Any victory.

28:56.687 --> 28:59.963
What honour is there in a victory
over a weaker opponent?

29:00.847 --> 29:02.963
Had Duras destroyed that ship...

29:03.447 --> 29:06.280
he would have been lauded
as a hero of the Empire...

29:06.407 --> 29:09.001
for murdering helpless refugees.

29:11.967 --> 29:15.755
We were a great society
not so long ago.

29:17.367 --> 29:19.358
When honour was earned...

29:19.607 --> 29:21.245
through integrity and...

29:22.007 --> 29:24.202
acts of true courage...

29:24.527 --> 29:26.563
not senseless bloodshed.

29:28.047 --> 29:31.039
For thousands of years,
my people had similar problems.

29:32.167 --> 29:35.364
We fought three world wars
that almost destroyed us.

29:35.527 --> 29:37.802
Whole generations were
nearly wiped out.

29:38.607 --> 29:40.006
What changed?

29:42.207 --> 29:45.756
A few courageous people
began to realise...

29:47.367 --> 29:48.846
they could make a difference.

30:06.007 --> 30:08.441
I have weighed the evidence carefully.

30:08.687 --> 30:11.804
Advocate Kolos has made
an impressive case...

30:11.927 --> 30:14.885
much to the surprise of this tribunal.

30:15.607 --> 30:17.484
Based upon his arguments...

30:17.607 --> 30:19.677
I am inclined to believe
that the accused...

30:19.807 --> 30:22.605
was a victim of his own foolishness.

30:22.847 --> 30:25.520
He was not fomenting rebellion.

30:26.727 --> 30:30.640
But, as Prosecutor Orak
has made clear...

30:30.927 --> 30:33.521
the laws of the Empire
have been violated...

30:33.647 --> 30:36.525
and Captain Archer
must be held accountable...

30:36.647 --> 30:40.276
for his actions regardless of his intent.

30:41.127 --> 30:43.641
I therefore find the accused...

30:43.767 --> 30:45.439
guilty as charged.

30:49.447 --> 30:50.800
However...

30:55.207 --> 30:57.880
this tribunal cannot ignore...

30:58.007 --> 31:00.760
his actions assisting
the Klingon people.

31:01.247 --> 31:05.160
Therefore the sentence of death
is commuted.

31:10.927 --> 31:12.201
Silence!

31:15.807 --> 31:17.365
Jonathan Archer...

31:18.007 --> 31:20.362
you are condemned
to the dilithium mines...

31:20.487 --> 31:23.479
of the penal colony of Rura Penthe...

31:24.167 --> 31:26.158
for the remainder of your life.

31:39.807 --> 31:41.957
- Remove the prisoner.
- I protest.

31:42.247 --> 31:46.559
I wouldn't protest too loudly,
Prosecutor. You've won your case.

31:46.927 --> 31:50.044
And I compliment the magistrate
on his just ruling.

31:50.407 --> 31:53.205
But the sentence for these crimes
must be death!

31:53.407 --> 31:55.159
The sentence is death.

31:55.567 --> 31:58.161
You condemned this man
to Rura Penthe.

31:58.847 --> 32:01.361
What is the life expectancy
of a prisoner there?

32:01.687 --> 32:04.076
Six months, a year at the most?

32:04.287 --> 32:07.677
And you expect us to believe
that this is an act of mercy.

32:07.807 --> 32:11.686
This court has shown you a great deal
of patience, Advocate.

32:11.807 --> 32:13.923
Don't test my limits any further.

32:14.047 --> 32:16.436
I ask for no special treatment...

32:16.967 --> 32:19.481
only that my client be judged fairly...

32:19.607 --> 32:21.484
as any Klingon would be judged.

32:21.607 --> 32:25.885
But it has been many years since
anyone stood in this chamber...

32:26.127 --> 32:27.719
and received justice.

32:27.847 --> 32:29.883
Watch your words!

32:30.007 --> 32:32.760
You insult the honour of this tribunal.

32:32.967 --> 32:34.116
Honour?

32:36.087 --> 32:40.638
You acknowledged that Captain Archer
acted with conviction and integrity...

32:40.767 --> 32:42.439
and how do you reward him?

32:42.647 --> 32:47.038
With this grand public display
of compassion...

32:47.287 --> 32:51.121
before sending him to his death
in a frozen cave!

32:51.327 --> 32:52.555
Enough!

32:52.687 --> 32:56.726
Forgive me if I fail to see
the honour in that!

32:56.927 --> 32:59.805
You are in contempt of this tribunal.

33:00.087 --> 33:03.477
Since you have such admiration
for the prisoner...

33:03.607 --> 33:06.804
you will join him on Rura Penthe...

33:06.927 --> 33:08.918
for a period of one year.

33:11.127 --> 33:12.719
Remove them both.

33:25.007 --> 33:26.122
The Vulcan High Command...

33:26.247 --> 33:28.681
will continue to lobby
for the Captain's release.

33:29.247 --> 33:30.396
So what do we do?

33:30.807 --> 33:33.879
The Klingons have only allowed us
to remain here during the trial.

33:34.687 --> 33:36.405
We're to leave immediately.

33:36.527 --> 33:39.519
- And abandon the Captain?
- We don't have a choice.

33:40.367 --> 33:42.676
What's this Rura Penthe like?

33:43.647 --> 33:45.239
It's quite inhospitable.

33:46.167 --> 33:47.919
They're going to have to get there.

33:48.207 --> 33:50.402
We're deep inside Klingon territory.

33:51.247 --> 33:53.203
A rescue attempt is out of the question.

33:54.167 --> 33:56.556
- I'm willing to risk it.
- The Captain isn't.

33:57.887 --> 34:01.436
He made it clear he didn't want us
to endanger the crew on his behalf.

34:02.367 --> 34:04.437
So you're saying
we just forget about him?

34:04.567 --> 34:08.355
I'm saying a rescue isn't an option,
but there are diplomatic channels.

34:08.487 --> 34:10.556
We tried diplomatic channels.

34:10.687 --> 34:12.040
Not all of them.

34:12.286 --> 34:14.960
I've dealt with several
Klingon bureaucrats in the past.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.760
Some of them can be persuaded.

34:20.447 --> 34:21.766
Mr Mayweather...

34:26.246 --> 34:27.726
take us out of orbit.

34:45.286 --> 34:46.879
You! Get back to work!

35:02.087 --> 35:03.315
You all right?

35:05.367 --> 35:09.121
Perhaps I spent too much time
in the law library...

35:09.567 --> 35:11.398
and not enough in the battlefield.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.995
Not all Klingons are warriors.
Remember?

35:16.767 --> 35:20.043
Our ships run on dilithium, not talk.

35:21.447 --> 35:23.677
- Leave him alone.
- Get back to work.

35:39.687 --> 35:41.325
Any more trouble from you...

35:41.447 --> 35:43.597
and you'll spend the night
on the surface.

35:52.167 --> 35:53.566
You're a fool.

35:55.607 --> 35:58.280
- You're welcome.
- Haven't you learned your lesson?

35:58.487 --> 36:00.842
This is why you were sent here
in the first place.

36:00.967 --> 36:04.164
For interfering in affairs
that have nothing to do with you.

36:04.407 --> 36:06.363
We have a saying on Earth:

36:06.927 --> 36:09.600
"You don't kick a man when he's down."

36:10.807 --> 36:13.799
So, are all humans like this?

36:14.407 --> 36:16.716
Like what? Fair?

36:17.687 --> 36:18.961
Stupid.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.045
It's in our nature.

36:31.527 --> 36:32.846
Stand up.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.479
We have work to do...

36:38.487 --> 36:41.126
unless you want to sleep on the surface.

37:06.687 --> 37:08.405
Follow me. This way.

37:09.207 --> 37:10.481
New arrivals.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.717
Prosecutor Orak has been busy.

37:50.127 --> 37:52.516
Stay away from us.
We have nothing you want.

37:52.647 --> 37:53.841
Captain.

37:54.967 --> 37:56.116
It's all right.

37:57.487 --> 37:58.840
He's from my ship.

38:00.167 --> 38:02.476
- It's good to see you, sir.
- You, too.

38:03.127 --> 38:06.199
Lieutenant Reed,
this is Kolos, my advocate.

38:07.487 --> 38:09.603
- Pleasure.
- How'd you get here?

38:09.767 --> 38:13.396
T'Pol knows a few Klingon officials
from her days in the Ministry of Security.

38:13.527 --> 38:16.166
One of them put us in touch
with a corrections officer...

38:16.327 --> 38:18.443
who looked the other way
for the right price.

38:18.567 --> 38:20.444
I came on one of the dilithium barges.

38:20.567 --> 38:23.798
We bribed the captain to bring us here
and take us back to Enterprise.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.406
Is there room for one more?

38:25.887 --> 38:28.355
I imagine so, but we have to hurry.

38:29.287 --> 38:32.199
- Come on.
- I can't go with you.

38:33.407 --> 38:34.522
Why not?

38:35.287 --> 38:37.721
I've been an advocate for 50 years.

38:38.127 --> 38:41.324
And I've spent the last 20 of them
standing in that tribunal...

38:42.207 --> 38:45.643
playing my part, holding my tongue...

38:45.887 --> 38:49.436
and all the while honourable men
were being sent to places like this...

38:49.607 --> 38:51.962
without the benefit of a defence.

38:52.207 --> 38:54.482
And then I was assigned to your case.

38:54.687 --> 38:56.803
You told me that on your world...

38:56.927 --> 38:59.282
a few courageous people
made a difference.

39:01.167 --> 39:03.078
I'm not sure I have the courage...

39:03.967 --> 39:07.676
but I know I'll never be able
to restore honour to my people...

39:08.247 --> 39:09.999
living as a fugitive.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.684
You realise what that means?

39:13.887 --> 39:16.037
You said most prisoners here...

39:17.207 --> 39:18.720
don't survive a year.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.486
Most prisoners here
have very little to live for.

39:24.087 --> 39:25.361
Captain.

39:26.887 --> 39:28.081
Go.

39:33.567 --> 39:34.556
Thank you.
