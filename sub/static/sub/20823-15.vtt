WEBVTT

00:08.180 --> 00:10.694
- Hola, papalHey! Could you
rustle up a cup of coffee for me

00:10.740 --> 00:13.698
and... what smells so good?
- Macaroni pie.

00:13.750 --> 00:16.651
Have one on the house!
We're workIn' on a new menu.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.224
- More like I'm workin',

00:19.280 --> 00:21.407
he's eatin'.
- Yeah, I figured as much.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.702
- Ha ha ha! Everyone
has their gifts.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.230
- It's a staple from my country,
the perfect comfort food.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.236
My son used to eat it
by the bucketful.

00:29.290 --> 00:33.067
- Yeah. He's in
Trinidad, I think.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.253
- Well, first rule about Shona

00:44.300 --> 00:46.518
is do not talk about her son.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.346
What's wrong with him?

00:48.390 --> 00:50.381
- I don't know. What part of the
first rule don't you understand?

00:50.440 --> 00:53.170
- Yeah, but you guys
are dating now. Isn't that

00:53.220 --> 00:55.609
what couples talk about?

00:55.660 --> 00:57.696
Hey, could I get two cups
of coffee to go, please?

00:57.750 --> 00:59.615
Angie wants me
to meet her client.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.187
- Wait! You think Shona wants me
to ask her about her son?

01:03.230 --> 01:06.495
- First rule about dads, never
meddle in their dating lives.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.667
Thanks.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.756
Good luck!
- Thanks. Have a good day.

01:24.990 --> 01:26.776
- So, where the hell
is this guy?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.516
- Relax. He'll be here.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.211
- Did I mention I gave up
free breakfast for this?

01:32.260 --> 01:34.433
- Twice. And it gets
more interesting

01:34.480 --> 01:36.436
every time.

01:39.050 --> 01:41.006
- Tyler Hill, but I doubt
that's his real name.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.393
- I don't know.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.873
Ithought
we didn't take on clients

01:45.930 --> 01:48.626
without vetting them.
- He sent a request to meet

01:48.670 --> 01:50.444
along with two days' pay
in an encrypted email.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.456
Let's just say I was curious.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.939
- Huh.

02:08.990 --> 02:11.550
Think that's for us?

02:15.350 --> 02:19.081
- 100 paces northeast, turn left
and follow the dirt path.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.914
- Well, this is the path.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.585
- Hey!

02:42.200 --> 02:44.452
- You have got to be kidding me.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.686
- Sorry for the cloak
and dagger.

02:49.730 --> 02:52.290
I had to be sure
the premises were secure.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.810
- And why didn't you mention
that you're like, 11?

02:55.870 --> 02:58.213
- First of all,
I'm 12 and a half.

02:58.260 --> 03:01.639
Second, if I told you
my real age,

03:01.700 --> 03:03.656
you wouldn't have
agreed to meet me.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.782
- Kid's got a point.

03:05.830 --> 03:08.219
- Can you please
not encourage him?

03:08.270 --> 03:10.704
- We came all the way out here.
Let's hear what he has to say.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.536
- We're not _
a babySIttIng serVIce.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.832
- You know I can
hear you guys, right?

03:14.890 --> 03:17.495
On account of my youthful ears.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.848
A lost puppy
A buried treasure

03:21.890 --> 03:23.881
in Mr. Witherspoon's
vegetable garden?

03:23.940 --> 03:26.841
- I want you
to look into a murder.

03:29.990 --> 03:33.460
- I see you and you see me

03:33.510 --> 03:37.810
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene

03:37.860 --> 03:40.681
Oh boy, you've got to know

03:40.740 --> 03:43.607
What my head overlooks

03:43.650 --> 03:47.268
The senses will show
to my heart

03:47.310 --> 03:51.565
When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my

03:51.620 --> 03:55.351
- Private Eyes
They're watching you

03:55.400 --> 03:58.528
Private Eyes

03:58.580 --> 04:00.753
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

04:00.800 --> 04:03.109
Watching you

04:14.640 --> 04:17.370
Dad, this is Miss Everett
and Mr. Shade,

04:17.430 --> 04:19.466
the P15 I mentioned.
Can you hook us up

04:19.520 --> 04:21.772
with a couple of juice boxes?

04:21.820 --> 04:23.947
Cranberry OK?
- Sure.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.161
- Yeah.
- Cranberry.

04:26.220 --> 04:29.383
- I'm sorry. He insisted.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.567
- Yeah.

04:31.610 --> 04:34.044
I blame myself. His mother and I
recently separated.

04:34.090 --> 04:37.708
I've been working a lot.
He's alone way too often.

04:37.750 --> 04:41.186
- So you don't put much stock in
whatever he's about to show us?

04:41.230 --> 04:43.573
- Well, he once thought
the Sorensons were taken over

04:43.630 --> 04:46.497
by a zombie virus. Turns out
it was a smoothie cleanse.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.407
Come on in.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.816
- Don't listen to my dad.

04:58.860 --> 05:00.760
He's not even here
half the time.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.947
- Sorry to hear
about the divorce.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.810
- At least I scored
on sympathy gifts.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.340
Dad gave me a drone
and mom gave me a camera,

05:07.390 --> 05:09.517
so I jerry-rigged them together.

05:09.570 --> 05:13.040
I call her the Bedford Falcon.

05:13.090 --> 05:15.479
She's our eye in the slq
in Bedford Hills.

05:15.530 --> 05:17.486
I've got hundreds of hours
of footage.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.792
I'm keeping
our neighbourhood safe.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.181
- That's Miss Holly Brown.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.140
She's a substitute teacher
at our school

05:30.190 --> 05:32.715
and... the murder victim.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.228
- Every morning,

05:35.290 --> 05:38.635
she comes out to do yoga.
She hasn't come out

05:38.680 --> 05:42.377
since Saturday.
- Maybe she quit.

05:42.420 --> 05:45.207
- Ms. Brown never quits!
- Or she's sick.

05:45.250 --> 05:48.333
Or on vacation.
- Or had a family emergency.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.255
Or any number of reasons.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.256
- There's more to the story.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.382
Everyone on the street
hates her.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.249
What did she do?

05:56.310 --> 05:58.266
- Miss. Brown is the only person
who treats us kids

05:58.310 --> 06:00.266
kids like... adults.

06:00.310 --> 06:03.040
She's not afraid
to talk about sex or religion.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.398
We even talked about drugs

06:05.450 --> 06:07.406
after Ryan Sims got caught
with pills in class.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.759
! Already?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.576
Whatever happened
to cherry bombs

06:12.630 --> 06:14.882
and girly magazines?
- OK, so there's some tension

06:14.930 --> 06:17.319
with the parents. There's
still no evidence of murder.

06:17.370 --> 06:19.713
- I'm getting to that.

06:19.770 --> 06:23.115
- That's Mr. Moffatt,
Holly's neighbour.

06:25.990 --> 06:27.946
I don't know what he does,

06:27.990 --> 06:30.948
but he's weird.
Once I saw him with a gun.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.901
- The night Ms. Brown

06:32.950 --> 06:35.032
disappeared, I landed

06:35.090 --> 06:37.433
the Bedford Falcon
on Ms. Brown's roof

06:37.480 --> 06:39.380
and that's when I recorded this.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.785
- Are you suggesting

06:42.830 --> 06:45.094
that Holly's body is in there?

06:45.140 --> 06:48.746
- I know it sounds crazy,
but I need you to look
into Mr. Moffatt.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.188
- Respectfully, little man,

06:53.230 --> 06:55.186
this is completely insane.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.367
- Respectfully, big man,

06:57.410 --> 06:59.492
you've already
cashed my advance.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.418
According to my contract,
you owe me two days of work.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.324
: Kid drives
a hard bargain.

07:07.380 --> 07:09.598
: You're not kidding.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.598
That's the last time I take on
a client without checking at
least the basic details.

07:15.650 --> 07:18.471
What grade he's in?
- Shut up.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.432
This is completely nuts.
- Just knock!

07:24.480 --> 07:26.789
If she answers, it's all over.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.049
- Oh, hi!

07:35.100 --> 07:37.273
I'm Doris Foster.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.788
I'm an old friend of Holly's
from university.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.011
- And I'm her husband, Wesley.
We just bought a house in the

07:42.070 --> 07:44.538
neighbourhood. We were hoping
to surprise Holly with a visit.

07:44.590 --> 07:47.320
- Welcome to Bedford Hills!
Gabe Moffatt.

07:47.370 --> 07:49.281
Unfortunately, your friend's
not here.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.981
- I think she went

07:52.030 --> 07:54.282
to her sister's. Not sure
when she'll be back.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.114
I'd invite you in
for a cup of java

07:56.170 --> 07:59.810
but I'm late for work.
You're gonna love It here.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.736
- Yeah.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.828
Now I'm really suspicious.
- Yeah.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.000
There's a light on.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.824
- OK, we are not breaking
into someone's house based on

08:11.880 --> 08:15.350
poor energy conservation habits
and the musings of
a 12-year-old.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.482
- Ah ha ha!

08:17.540 --> 08:19.405
Who said anything
about breaking in?

08:29.720 --> 08:32.245
- You know, you didn't have to
tell him that we were married.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.281
- You opened the door.
I just went with it.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.286
- You're a retired
hockey player. He might have

08:36.340 --> 08:38.501
recognized you.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.120
7 Word travels fast
In a place like this.

08:41.170 --> 08:43.775
Now we have to pretend
any time we see anybody.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.345
I'm pretty quick on my feet.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.824
- Yeah, but who's gonna believe
I settled for you?

08:48.870 --> 08:50.826
- Ha ha.

08:50.870 --> 08:53.134
There's a bunch of open cabinets
and drawers in here.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.954
- Maybe she was looking
for something.

08:55.010 --> 08:57.786
- Yeah, or someone else was.
- There's no signs

08:57.840 --> 08:59.967
of struggle and her car
is still in the driveway.

09:00.010 --> 09:03.275
- I'm not likin' the looks of
these dirty dishes in the sink

09:03.320 --> 09:06.016
or those papers on the porch.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.359
- Maybe she was in a hurry.

09:09.410 --> 09:11.196
- Look.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.026
She had drinks with Gabe

09:13.070 --> 09:14.844
on Saturday, the day
she disappeared.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.118
- OK, maybe this kid's

09:17.160 --> 09:19.116
on to something.

09:29.130 --> 09:32.475
- Holly's Ameechee, Instagram
and Facebook accounts

09:32.520 --> 09:34.568
haven't been updated
since she disappeared.

09:34.610 --> 09:36.566
I can't find anything on Gabe.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.430
- Totes!

09:38.490 --> 09:40.390
Thanks.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.920
- Holly's sister Carmine

09:42.970 --> 09:44.926
studies horticulture at Guelph.

09:44.970 --> 09:46.926
So, I assumed the name
of one of her classmates

09:46.970 --> 09:48.926
and got her number
from her mother.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.926
Then I contacted Carmine
and assumed the name

09:50.980 --> 09:54.234
of one of Holly's classmates and
chatted her up like
we were besties.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.066
- Wow. You're gettin'
good at this.

09:56.110 --> 09:58.021
- Bottom line,

09:58.070 --> 09:59.799
Carmine hasn't seen Holly
for six months.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.499
- And yet Gabe said
she was there.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.415
- I also pretended to be
a parent at Holly's school.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.462
Confirmed with the secretary
that Holly called in sick

10:07.510 --> 10:09.990
Sunday night and is at home
recovering with the flu.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.076
- I didn't see
any signs of a flu.

10:12.130 --> 10:14.735
- Or any signs of Holly.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.169
- So, Holly disappears

10:17.220 --> 10:20.348
Saturday afternoon after having
drinks with her neighbour Gabe.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.356
- No trace of her
Sunday, yesterday

10:22.400 --> 10:24.356
or today except for
the one phone call

10:24.400 --> 10:26.482
Sunday night.
- Assuming that was really her.

10:33.670 --> 10:35.626
Hey.

10:35.670 --> 10:38.673
: [I'm on my way.
They were out of jalapeno.]

10:38.720 --> 10:40.938
- All right. Meet me out front.
I think it's time

10:40.980 --> 10:43.028
we go see
what old Gabe is up to.

10:57.870 --> 11:00.304
- This is completely insane.
- I know.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.306
What kind of banh mi place

11:02.350 --> 11:04.523
runs out of jalapenos?
- No!

11:04.570 --> 11:07.653
I mean being here in
_Pleasantville. I_can't
wait to write up this report.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.575
Suspect is guilty

11:09.620 --> 11:11.576
of garishly painting
his garden trellis.

11:11.620 --> 11:14.669
- Am I sensing some issue
with our suburban friends?

11:14.710 --> 11:17.053
- Like you'd wanna
live in Bedford Hills.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.362
It's clean, it's safe,

11:19.410 --> 11:21.321
the people are friendly.
What's not to like?

11:21.370 --> 11:23.679
- It's all manufactured!
The white picket fence,

11:23.720 --> 11:25.676
the 2.1 children,
the lame barbecues

11:25.720 --> 11:29.201
that everyone pretends to enjoy.
- Wow. Methinks we struck
a nerve.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.292
- OK, yeah.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.331
My uncle lived in the 'burbs
when I was a kid.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.518
He had these monthly barbecues
filled with dumb activities

11:38.560 --> 11:40.869
like bocce ball
and sack races and...

11:40.910 --> 11:42.992
one time they even
hired a clown.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.086
I hate clowns.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.086
- Everyone hates clowns...

11:47.140 --> 11:49.005
but what's wrong with bocce ball
and sack races?

11:49.050 --> 11:50.915
- They're not real games!
They're just exercises

11:50.970 --> 11:52.870
in forced camaraderie.
- Did you ever con5ider

11:52.920 --> 11:55.093
that maybe you suck
at said games?

11:55.140 --> 11:57.700
- How was I supposed to learn
when they purposely excluded me?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.718
- As long as there's no issue.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.228
Oh.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.748
This might be him.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.987
- All right, Gabe.
What are you up to?

12:20.950 --> 12:22.906
- It looks like he went
to a hardware store.

12:22.950 --> 12:26.511
- That does not look like
a garden trellis. What's
this guy doing?

12:26.570 --> 12:28.959
- A shovel, an axe, some bleach.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.309
- Something tells me
he's not bakin' a cake.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.398
- I've seen this episode
of Dexter. It doesn't end well.

12:36.970 --> 12:40.053
- I think it's time
we talk to Maz.
- Yeah.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.885
: Let me get this straight. A twelve-year-old kid

12:49.940 --> 12:51.805
has a crush on his teacher,
and now he's convinced

12:51.850 --> 12:54.375
that the neighbour he's spying
on illegally has hacked her

12:54.420 --> 12:56.285
to bits
- Holly's social media has

12:56.340 --> 12:58.376
been dark since Saturday.
- You said she called in sick

12:58.420 --> 13:00.422
on Sunday, right? Murder victims
tend not to do that.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.461
- We don't even know if
that was her! And if she's sick,

13:02.520 --> 13:04.590
then why isn't she at home?
- Maybe she was with a friend.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.811
Maybe she has a lover. Why is
this any of your business?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.644
- Her car is still in
the driveway and she hasn't done

13:08.700 --> 13:11.658
her yoga in days.
- I haven't done
yoga ever! I'm not dead!

13:11.700 --> 13:14.658
- The neighbour,
Gabe Moffatt, was buying

13:14.700 --> 13:16.656
bleach and plastic sheeting!

13:16.700 --> 13:18.486
That's the full murder kit!
- Maybe Holly went somewhere

13:18.530 --> 13:21.135
she didn't want
the neighbours to know.

13:21.190 --> 13:24.705
- Can you just look into Gabe,
please? There's no trace of him
on social media.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.705
- I did. He happens to have
a profession for which having

13:26.760 --> 13:30.014
a social media profile
is frowned upon.
Gabe Moffatt is a cop.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.720
- Shh! Keep your voice down.

13:40.770 --> 13:43.238
We have to be as quiet and
professional as possible now.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.691
Tyler.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.139
- What are you doing here,
Tyler? It's after midnight!

14:06.190 --> 14:09.796
- Perfect time to test the
Falcon's new, nocturnal upgrade.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.626
I've added night vision lenses
capable of seeing

14:11.670 --> 14:13.490
up to 400 yards.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.145
Does that baby really work?
- Hey!

14:16.200 --> 14:18.930
Don't you have school tomorrow?

14:18.980 --> 14:20.936
If you really want to know
what happened to Ms. Brown,

14:20.990 --> 14:22.935
you have to let us do our job.

14:27.380 --> 14:30.122
- We have to get inside. Now.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.946
He's cutting her up!
: Wait.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.956
He's coming.
- You have to go home now.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.560
Please.

14:43.490 --> 14:46.004
- Here we go!

14:46.050 --> 14:48.098
Here he comes.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.662
All right.

15:32.710 --> 15:34.610
This is where you dig.

15:34.670 --> 15:36.626
That's your job.
- Well, you're the one

15:36.670 --> 15:38.626
who's convinced there's
not a body in there.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.138
- You have stronger forearms
on account of the hockey.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.624
- Hands in the air.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.297
- We don't have any weapons
and we haven't broken any laws.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.386
- Yeah. We'll see about that.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.386
If you're gonna write me up,
I'm writing you up right back.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.431
- What the hell
are you talking about?

16:06.480 --> 16:08.528
- Lurking and loitering
for starters.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.388
- No.

16:15.450 --> 16:17.918
We're private investigators.
My name's Angie Everett and

16:17.970 --> 16:19.926
this is my partner, Matt Shade.
- Oh!

16:19.970 --> 16:22.621
Thank God.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.326
- I'm renovating
the whole basement.

16:32.380 --> 16:35.543
This'll be my new bathroom.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.465
I'm dropping the floor
two inches myself,

16:37.510 --> 16:40.297
sneaking the dirt
out to the bushes at night.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.945
- No permit.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.082
- So... why did you lie
about Holly?

16:47.130 --> 16:51.476
- No. Let's just say
it was a concerned neighbour.

16:51.530 --> 16:53.566
- Does this concerned
neighbour sub5ist

16:53.620 --> 16:56.088
on a diet of pizza pops
and cranberry juice boxes?

16:56.140 --> 16:58.574
Tyler Hill strikes again.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.576
- He once thought

17:00.620 --> 17:02.668
the Gilmores had a poltergeist.

17:02.710 --> 17:05.531
_ Turned out to be
their new garage door opener.

17:05.580 --> 17:08.322
- He's concerned for his teacher
and frankly, so are we.

17:08.370 --> 17:10.497
She left under some
pretty strange Circumstances.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.848
- I think I know
what this is about.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.152
Holly and I are...
fond of each other.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.509
- Just good friends.

17:17.550 --> 17:21.077
For_ now. But Bedford Hills
is very conservative.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.906
Sometimes people talk.

17:22.950 --> 17:24.770
- Why did you say
that she went to her sister's?

17:24.820 --> 17:26.993
- I get why that looks weird,

17:27.040 --> 17:29.429
but I swear, I was just
trying to protect her.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.179
- I think Holly has
a substance abuse problem.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.394
When I was there last week,
I found opioids in her house.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.874
- Did you consider
reporting her?

17:40.920 --> 17:43.354
- No, Ijust... Ijust
wanna get her help.

17:45.410 --> 17:47.230
- I invited her over
on Saturday to talk.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.714
When I mentioned the pills,
she got defensive.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.196
Now I calmed her down,
went to pour some wine but...

17:53.240 --> 17:55.196
when I got back, she was gone.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.548
- And you haven't
heard from her since?

17:56.590 --> 17:58.899
- I texted her... a dozen times,

17:58.940 --> 18:01.113
but nothing.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.425
To be honest,
I'm really worried about her.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.084
- When I see anything

18:16.260 --> 18:18.262
I think of you

18:18.310 --> 18:20.175
Oh

18:20.220 --> 18:23.223
Oh, sing it to me, baby

18:30.150 --> 18:33.756
- I'm sorry about yesterday.
- Oh, it's OK. He didn't know.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.109
- No, I'm talking about me.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.061
I never asked you
about your son.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.424
- His name is Noah Ruano.

18:47.470 --> 18:49.904
And he got into
the University of Toronto

18:49.950 --> 18:53.477
and was excited
to come to Canada

18:53.520 --> 18:55.476
but...

18:55.520 --> 18:57.602
then his father
poisoned him against me.

19:01.740 --> 19:05.176
- He stayed in Trinidad.
We lost touch.

19:05.230 --> 19:08.040
- That's gotta be hard.
I mean, he's your son.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.056
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.273
I mean, I wrote him letters,

19:12.320 --> 19:14.834
hoping to re-establish contact.

19:14.890 --> 19:17.973
So I finally gave up.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.749
The last letter came back
return to sender.

19:25.070 --> 19:27.630
- It's OK, Don. I'm over it.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.023
Really.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.476
- Hey, Don.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.294
- Hey.

19:39.350 --> 19:42.820
- Could I get a chai tea and a
blueberry scone to go, please?

19:42.870 --> 19:44.918
- Zoe.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.916
If I gave you

19:46.960 --> 19:50.657
a name and a city
and an approximate birth date,

19:50.710 --> 19:52.655
could you track a guy down
for me?

19:52.710 --> 19:54.837
I just need his phone number.

19:54.880 --> 19:58.008
- My contract says I'm
only allowed to work for
Miss Everett and Mr. Shade.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.528
- I'm Mr. Shade.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.457
And I pay cash.

20:18.950 --> 20:22.511
- Gabe Moffatt isn't a murderer.
He's just building a bathroom.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.120
- And he has a gun
because he's a police officer.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.523
So there's no reason to believe
he's hurt Holly, OK?

20:29.660 --> 20:31.616
- We don't know.
Maybe she went to go

20:31.660 --> 20:33.616
visit a friend.
It's not our business.

20:33.660 --> 20:36.003
- All we know is that she was
having drinks at Gabe's and they

20:36.060 --> 20:38.870
got into a minor argument.

20:38.930 --> 20:41.239
- Adults have adult problems.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.316
- Is that why she was so upset
at the barbecue?

20:43.370 --> 20:46.715
- Mr. and Mrs. Green's.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.978
I just heard
from Brayden McShane

20:49.030 --> 20:50.975
that she showed up there
on Saturday.

20:51.030 --> 20:53.544
- What did Brayden McShane
say exactly?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.727
- Just that it didn't go well.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.988
You can ask Mrs. Green
at the do-over.

20:58.030 --> 21:00.248
- Tonight.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.337
She's hosting another barbecue
to make up for it.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.813
- Hm.

21:05.870 --> 21:07.906
- I guess it's time
for Mr. and Mrs. Foster

21:07.960 --> 21:10.212
to meet the Greens.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.650
Cocktail sandwiches?

21:16.710 --> 21:18.837
- I'm Wesley Foster,
this is my wife Doris.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.745
- I love what you've
done back here!

21:20.800 --> 21:24.270
- Oh, it's so nice to have
people move in with taste!

21:24.320 --> 21:26.276
Bedford Hills is
the perfect place

21:26.320 --> 21:28.276
to raise a family.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.230
- Exactly why we're trying!

21:30.280 --> 21:32.589
Hopefully we'll have
a bun in the oven real soon.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.588
- Although it's proving
to be a bit of a challenge

21:35.640 --> 21:37.596
clue to the low sperm count.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.767
- She's kidding, of course.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.594
We're just so happy to be out

21:41.640 --> 21:43.426
of the city.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.121
Doris has such fond memories
of barbecues

21:46.170 --> 21:48.297
from her childhood.
You know, the bocce ball,

21:48.350 --> 21:50.773
sack races,
those hilarious clowns.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.299
- No.
- Let me introduce you.

21:56.350 --> 21:58.659
- You made me a clown lover.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.134
- Payback hurts.

22:01.180 --> 22:03.182
- I'd like you to meet

22:03.230 --> 22:05.482
Doris and Wesley Foster.
They're new

22:05.540 --> 22:07.701
to the neighbourhood.
- Welcome to Bedford Hills.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.012
You couldn't ask for _
a better place to have a family.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.142
- Wow! Word travels fast.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.145
Do you guys have children
of your own?

22:14.200 --> 22:17.283
- Both of ours have moved out.
Kale is an undergrad at UBC

22:17.330 --> 22:19.321
and Flora just started
medical school at Stanford.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.189
- Wow. _
- We value education

22:21.250 --> 22:23.150
here at Bedford Hills. Did you
know that we have the highest

22:23.210 --> 22:25.155
number of high school graduates
in all of Canada?

22:25.210 --> 22:27.815
- Wow!

22:27.860 --> 22:29.999
- Woodside High with honours.
- Well, chalk up two more

22:30.040 --> 22:32.474
in the high school
graduate column!

22:32.520 --> 22:34.476
- We love being empty nesters.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.478
There's so much to do here.
- Outdoor movie night,

22:37.530 --> 22:40.397
bingo Fridays. Oh, and Sherman
plays indoor soccer

22:40.440 --> 22:43.170
with the boys. Maybe you can
take Wesley sometime.

22:43.230 --> 22:46.484
- Absolutely.
- Great.

22:46.530 --> 22:49.317
- Well, excuse me. The sausages
won't flip themselves.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.012
- I wanted to talk
to you, actually.

22:55.060 --> 22:57.676
What is up with
your neighbour Holly?

22:57.720 --> 23:00.154
I heard she caused quite
the scene last Saturday.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.249
- Oh, yes. Well, I mean, she did
show up and all but you know,

23:03.290 --> 23:06.020
she's an acquired taste. Holly
and I get along swimmingly.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.423
- That's not what we were told.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.859
- Is it the Buckmans
you were talking to?

23:13.470 --> 23:17.213
- Oh, OK. Between you and I
and the fencepost,

23:17.260 --> 23:21.173
Holly did show up here and
she did indeed cause a scene

23:21.220 --> 23:24.132
but that's between
her and the Buckmans.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.876
: Hm.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.222
- So, have you thought of a name
yet for the little one?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.498
Oh, Mrs. Green told me.
- Oh, I'm not--

23:36.540 --> 23:39.270
- Zoe if it's a girl,
Don if it's a boy.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.753
- Good, strong names.
We don't believe

23:41.810 --> 23:43.710
in non-traditional labels.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.113
None of this androgynous stuff,
am I right?

23:48.420 --> 23:51.469
- Speaking of non-traditional,
what's going on with your
neighbour, Holly?

23:51.510 --> 23:54.468
- We heard she caused
quite the scene last Saturday.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.387
- Oh, I didn't see her.
- Honey, what are you

23:57.430 --> 23:59.421
talking about?
She came in and she...

23:59.480 --> 24:02.210
I'm thinking of someone else.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.529
- To be honest, Holly just
doesn't quite fit in.

24:07.570 --> 24:09.913
Prancing around
in those yoga pants,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.779
mixing her recycling,

24:11.840 --> 24:13.705
sneaking my daughter chocolates

24:13.750 --> 24:15.615
when she knows our views
on sugar.

24:15.670 --> 24:18.355
We have been more than tolerant.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.496
This is my daughter, Maya.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.496
Maya, have you met the Fosters?

24:24.550 --> 24:27.713
- Negative. Nice to meet you.

24:32.340 --> 24:35.070
- Mrs. Buckman was
a little too eager

24:35.120 --> 24:36.940
to say how tolerant
she is with Holly.

24:36.990 --> 24:38.810
- Told you. Fake camaraderie.

24:38.860 --> 24:40.908
You wonder why
I hate the 'burbs!

24:45.520 --> 24:48.523
Hey! You're pretty handy
with a wrench.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.482
- Holly taught me.

24:51.530 --> 24:52.781
What's she like?

24:52.830 --> 24:56.527
- She's cool.
Not that Mom agrees.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.799
- Did you happen to see her
at the barbecue on Saturday?

24:59.840 --> 25:03.059
- I stayed home. She came
to our yard later.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.533
- Maybe 4:30.

25:05.590 --> 25:07.842
She and Mom were arguing.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.636
- Something about clothes...

25:12.680 --> 25:15.285
because I saw Mom throw Holly's
top in the garbage later.

25:15.330 --> 25:18.413
- Why would your mom
have Holly's clothes?

25:18.470 --> 25:20.904
- Parents are weird.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.211
- You're right about
the suburbs. Too many secrets.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.956
- Especially in
the Buckman household.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.867
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

25:32.920 --> 25:35.650
- Yeah. Every good barbecue
has parting gifts.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.365
VVhoa!

25:50.410 --> 25:52.366
Mini candy bar wrappers!

25:52.420 --> 25:54.638
I thought the Buckmans
were a no sugar household.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.841
Tea bag.

25:56.900 --> 26:00.119
A sock. Guess the dryer
ate the other one.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.811
- Zoe!

26:02.860 --> 26:04.646
Sure you don't
wanna join in the fun?

26:04.690 --> 26:07.295
- Mmm... no, I'm good.

26:07.340 --> 26:10.127
And totally not distracted
by a side project.

26:10.170 --> 26:13.435
- This is pointless and gross.
What are we doing?

26:19.220 --> 26:21.745
Is that blood?
- This changes everything.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.936
- Guess I got
your attention now.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.936
- Yeah, well, a missing person's
bloody top has a way

26:38.980 --> 26:40.936
of doing that. The fastest I
ever processed a piece

26:40.990 --> 26:44.414
of evidence in my entire life.
- It wasn't contaminated,
was it?

26:44.470 --> 26:46.290
- No, thankfully it wasn't.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.298
Now, it appears
that Holly was the victim

26:49.340 --> 26:51.388
of a first degree,
vegetative assault.

26:51.430 --> 26:53.250
- Beet juice.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.645
It was beet juice, Angie!
- Oh, come on! How was I

26:56.700 --> 26:58.656
supposed to know that?
- I mean, thank God

26:58.700 --> 27:00.520
it wasn't carrot! I mean,
those stains never come out!

27:00.570 --> 27:02.435
Or rutabaga! Can you imagine?
- Do not make me out to be

27:02.490 --> 27:05.050
an idiot, OK? Something fishy
happened to Holly Brown

27:05.100 --> 27:07.000
and you know it!

27:07.060 --> 27:09.358
You're startin' to lose it. OK?
I love you, but you are

27:09.410 --> 27:11.355
going off the deep end here.
- She's been missing for almost

27:11.410 --> 27:13.184
three days, Maz.
What do you expect me to do?

27:13.240 --> 27:15.185
- I don't know. Maybe stop
taking cases from the cast

27:15.240 --> 27:17.196
of Stranger Things?

27:29.510 --> 27:31.466
: Morning, Don.

27:31.510 --> 27:34.946
- Here you go. A large chai,
just like you like it,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.299
and a blueberry scone. So,
do you have an update for me?

27:38.350 --> 27:41.308
- I found Noah Ruano.

27:41.350 --> 27:44.399
Oh, that's great!

27:44.440 --> 27:46.214
- Yeah, he lives in San Juan.

27:46.270 --> 27:48.226
He's 35 years old.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.784
He works as a manager
at Hotel Bastion.

27:50.840 --> 27:54.446
Trouble is when I called

27:54.490 --> 27:56.401
to confirm he was there,

27:56.450 --> 27:58.270
I didn't expect him to answer.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.936
- I panicked!

28:00.980 --> 28:03.323
Everything just came out!
Now he knows his mother's

28:03.370 --> 28:05.975
looking for him.
And why I do not deserve

28:06.030 --> 28:09.284
these delicious treats.
- And why Shona is
so gonna kill me.

28:13.510 --> 28:15.592
- Maybe she'll forget
after she talks to him.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.459
- Wait.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.988
Noah wants her to call?

28:20.040 --> 28:21.996
- You're right. It's a bad idea.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.691
- No, no, no! It's...
it's only a bad idea

28:24.740 --> 28:26.696
for the other Boyfriend
of the Year contenders!

28:26.740 --> 28:29.823
'Cause I wrapped that trophy up!

28:29.880 --> 28:31.780
Thank you so much!

28:31.840 --> 28:33.705
Thank you!

28:36.670 --> 28:39.093
- Hm!

28:44.760 --> 28:47.752
- Oh, we're an air dry family.
Better for the environment.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.766
- What can we do
for you, Mrs. Foster?

28:49.810 --> 28:52.449
- Actually it's Everett.
Angie Everett.

28:52.510 --> 28:54.410
I'm a private investigator.
- And I'm her partner,

28:54.470 --> 28:56.938
Matt Shade. We were hoping
you guys could answer

28:56.990 --> 28:59.857
a few questions for us.

28:59.910 --> 29:02.606
- We've been looking into
the disappearance of Holly Brown

29:02.650 --> 29:05.084
and we found something troubling
in your garbage.

29:05.130 --> 29:08.088
- Those chocolate bars
are Mayas.

29:10.220 --> 29:12.302
- That's not what we were
talking about. You said

29:12.350 --> 29:14.523
that Holly didn't
go to the barbecue.

29:14.570 --> 29:16.572
Then what were you
doing with this?

29:16.620 --> 29:19.612
- Oh, my Lord. That is not what
it looks like. Cliff, tell them.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.706
- Well, we don't know for sure
that that's what Holly

29:21.760 --> 29:23.273
was doing, honey.
- What are you guys

29:23.320 --> 29:25.276
talking about?
- Holly was not welcome

29:25.320 --> 29:27.276
at the barbecue, yet she showed
up anyway. And I think she was

29:27.330 --> 29:30.754
peddling drugs.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.062
- I saw them with my own eyes.

29:33.110 --> 29:35.499
They were in a brown satchel,
all these little blue pills.

29:35.550 --> 29:37.598
And I think she was trying
to sell some to my daughter.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.894
- Emily, please. It might have
been vitamins in those bags,

29:40.950 --> 29:42.906
and we don't know
that she was looking for Maya.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.202
- Well how did those pills
get into Maya's school, then?

29:45.260 --> 29:47.069
Look, she was in my yard.

29:47.130 --> 29:49.428
And I think she was high.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.345
After she got that juice stain
on her shirt,

29:51.390 --> 29:53.255
I caught her stealing one
of my tops right off the line.

29:53.310 --> 29:55.949
- So you threw beet juice at her

29:56.010 --> 29:57.966
to keep her away
from your daughter?

29:58.010 --> 30:00.137
- I may have yelled at her
for stealing my shirt

30:00.180 --> 30:02.398
but I certainly did not
throw that beet juice.

30:02.450 --> 30:04.964
- Well if you didn't,
then who did?

30:08.060 --> 30:11.530
- OK, it was me. She was
ruining the barbecue!

30:11.590 --> 30:13.808
- Why do you care

30:13.850 --> 30:15.977
who threw the beet juice,
Mrs. Foster?

30:16.030 --> 30:18.851
- I'm not Mrs._Foster.
My name is Angie Everett

30:18.900 --> 30:22.074
and this is my partner,
Matt Shade.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.940
- We're private investigators.
Have either of you

30:23.990 --> 30:27.118
heard of Holly using
or selling pills?

30:27.170 --> 30:29.684
- No, but it wouldn't surprise
me if she was into drugs.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.901
I mean, with all
the meditation and yoga...

30:31.960 --> 30:34.303
- Don't defend her.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.950
Women like Holly, they operate
on their own level.

30:39.010 --> 30:40.955
- What do you mean
by "women like Holly"?

30:41.010 --> 30:42.910
- Let's just say

30:42.970 --> 30:45.268
what Holly wants, Holly gets.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.016
Excuse us.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.234
- Do you think Holly and
Mr. Green were having an affair?

31:00.680 --> 31:04.207
: Hey, buddy.

31:04.250 --> 31:06.206
Your friends are here
to see you.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.385
- I'll leave you guys to it.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.043
- The Bedford Falcon
is grounded. And so am I.

31:19.090 --> 31:21.695
- Your dad told us
about the petition.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.913
You can only fly it
in the park now, huh?

31:23.960 --> 31:26.349
- I was planning to take it
to the next level.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.528
I just dropped all this coin
on an external mic.

31:29.580 --> 31:33.141
- We didn't see you
at the barbecue.

31:33.190 --> 31:35.055
- Dad was working.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.919
I don't really like
those things anyway.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.938
- Yeah. I hate
those group events too.

31:39.980 --> 31:42.676
- There was a cute girl there.
Maya. Do you know her?

31:42.720 --> 31:44.938
- She's a weirdo.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.242
Always on her own
doing weirdo things.

31:47.290 --> 31:50.020
- Hmm... that doesn't
sound familiar at all!

31:50.080 --> 31:53.334
- Hey, um, you mentioned

31:53.380 --> 31:56.201
you had hundreds of hours of
drone footage. You still got it?

31:56.260 --> 32:00.435
- 'Cause we need your help.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.734
So... Mr. Green says
he plays indoor soccer.

32:03.790 --> 32:07.135
That's every Tuesday at 6PM
at the Bedford Civic Centre.

32:07.180 --> 32:09.705
- We're trying to see

32:09.750 --> 32:12.833
if Mr. Green and Holly
are in any way connected.

32:19.110 --> 32:22.147
- Let's just focus
on Mr. Green for now, OK?

32:22.200 --> 32:24.145
He drives a red sedan.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.236
Can you find any footage
of him leaving?

32:29.990 --> 32:31.946
- Here we go. Last Tuesday,

32:31.990 --> 32:35.244
5:55. Red sedan on the move.

32:39.340 --> 32:41.558
- That's weird.

32:41.610 --> 32:45.216
- The Civic Centre is west.
His car's g0ing east.

32:45.260 --> 32:47.911
Hang on.

33:02.060 --> 33:04.016
- Holy crap!

33:07.020 --> 33:09.716
That's Ms. Brown's house!

33:09.770 --> 33:12.637
- "Indoor soccer" my ass!

33:12.680 --> 33:16.207
- Mr. Green has been
a very naughty boy.

33:22.260 --> 33:25.161
- I see someone

33:25.220 --> 33:27.859
Like you

33:27.910 --> 33:32.176
To call my very own

33:32.220 --> 33:34.745
- One chicken roti,
extra chutney.

33:34.790 --> 33:38.044
- Hey!
- Oh, hey!

33:38.100 --> 33:40.056
- She's about to find out.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.318
- No. I wrote it
on one of the order slips,

33:42.360 --> 33:44.225
that way it's
a complete surprise.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.016
- BLT on brown.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.368
- It's the next one.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.761
- My life is not yours to fix.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.728
- Maybe you should hold off
on that Boyfriend of
the Year award.

34:10.130 --> 34:13.088
- "What Holly wants,
Holly gets."

34:13.130 --> 34:14.995
- And it appears
Holly wanted you,

34:15.050 --> 34:17.655
Mr. Green, or perhaps it was you
that wanted Holly.

34:17.700 --> 34:19.918
- Which explains why you were
reluctant to invite my husband

34:19.970 --> 34:22.313
to play indoor soccer.
You never went, did you?

34:22.360 --> 34:24.669
- Will you please keep
your voice down? It's not

34:24.710 --> 34:27.270
what you think.

34:27.320 --> 34:30.585
- I don't know! But you wanna
know what I did with her?

34:37.770 --> 34:39.715
This.

34:39.770 --> 34:42.500
- 12th grade calculus.
- All this talk

34:42.550 --> 34:44.336
about Bedford having
the most high school graduates?

34:44.380 --> 34:46.166
I wasn't one of them.
Until Holly.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.724
- Helping me get

34:48.780 --> 34:50.736
my high school diploma.

34:50.780 --> 34:53.385
For years, I lied to my wife
about graduating high school.

34:53.430 --> 34:55.216
I couldn't take it anymore.
So Holly hooked me up

34:55.260 --> 34:57.216
with an adult
correspondence course.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.342
- And your wife assumed
you were having an affair.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.914
- Crazy, I know. I just finished

35:01.960 --> 35:04.576
my exams on Tuesday.
I'm waiting on the results.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.576
Please, don't tell my wife.

35:06.620 --> 35:08.531
She doesn't know any of this.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.445
- She does now.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.049
Why on earth didn't you tell me?

35:14.110 --> 35:17.580
- I thought you'd be ashamed.

35:17.630 --> 35:20.542
- Oh, Sherman.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.937
And what about Holly? I'm really
starting to get worried.

35:25.990 --> 35:29.164
- Yeah, so are we. This whole
thing might have to do
with drugs.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.771
- She asked me for a favour.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.515
She said she had
to take care of something

35:35.560 --> 35:37.289
and wanted_to borrow
my credit card.

35:37.350 --> 35:39.648
- You didn't give it
to her, did you?

35:39.700 --> 35:42.134
- It's the least I could do
after all she's done for me.

35:42.180 --> 35:45.081
- We need to know the last place
that card was used.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.450
- Paid for with Mr. Green's
credit card since Saturday.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.456
Holly's definitely here.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.503
- OK. So, Saturday,

36:06.550 --> 36:08.336
Holly goes for drinks at Gabe's

36:08.380 --> 36:10.245
where he mentions the pills
that he found in her house.

36:10.290 --> 36:12.941
- Knowing he's a cop, she panics
and runs back to her house

36:12.990 --> 36:15.379
to hide her stash.
- Or maybe to sell it quickly.

36:15.430 --> 36:17.295
- But with Gabe on her tail,

36:17.340 --> 36:19.126
she needs to make
herself invisible.

36:19.170 --> 36:22.697
- So she runs down the street to
borrow Mr. Green's credit card.

36:22.740 --> 36:25.959
- Which upsets his wife,
who wrongfully assumes

36:26.000 --> 36:28.002
that Holly's having an affair
with her husband.

36:28.050 --> 36:31.042
Splash goes the beet juice.
- Holly has to change her shirt

36:31.100 --> 36:33.705
but she can't go home
because Gabe's sniffin' around.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.706
- So she runs next door,

36:35.750 --> 36:37.923
steals a shirt off the line
but gets caught by Mrs. Buckman.

36:37.970 --> 36:40.621
- Only to wind up here,
in this crappy motel

36:40.670 --> 36:43.491
where she calls in sick
to school on Sunday

36:43.540 --> 36:45.588
and stays until now.

36:47.810 --> 36:49.675
Do you think this is
where she's dealing?

37:05.350 --> 37:07.818
- Hey, hey, hey! You've
gotta stop running!

37:07.870 --> 37:10.304
We know about
your opioid problem!

37:10.350 --> 37:12.306
- Look, I don't
have an opioid problem.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.487
My neighbour does.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.796
- He invited me over
for some Wine

37:21.840 --> 37:23.705
and I was looking for glasses
and that is when I found

37:23.760 --> 37:25.580
his stash.
- Wow.

37:25.630 --> 37:27.450
I'm guessing he wasn't pleased.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.492
- Yeah. He said to pretend
that I never saw it.

37:30.550 --> 37:33.064
He said if I ever breathed
a word to anyone, he'd frame me

37:33.120 --> 37:36.988
and end my career.

37:37.030 --> 37:38.816
- I just needed to hide

37:38.860 --> 37:40.634
and get these drugs
out of my school.

37:40.690 --> 37:42.646
- Holly, we can help you.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.464
If we go to the police with--

37:44.520 --> 37:47.034
- No. Gabe is the police.
He'll just pin this on me.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.308
I mean, he assured me
that there's no way these pills

37:49.350 --> 37:51.910
can be traced back to him.
- Because he skimmed them

37:51.960 --> 37:53.916
from evidence.
They're invisible.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.349
- But I can't let him get away
with this. I know

37:56.400 --> 37:59.358
what this does to communities.
I've seen this in my school.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.220
What am I gonna do?

38:01.270 --> 38:04.228
- There is one thing
we could try.

38:15.330 --> 38:18.060
- Hi, Holly.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.111
I was worried about you.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.980
You disappeared on me there.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.339
- Well I was upset
about what I found.

38:24.380 --> 38:26.336
- You mean about what you took.

38:26.390 --> 38:29.382
Where's my bag?
- Just say what it is, Gabe.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.653
I'm not wired.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.656
I chose this place
so we could talk freely.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.961
Those drugs ended up in
my school, Gabe. Kids are dying!

38:44.010 --> 38:45.966
- These things are
everywhere, Holly.

38:46.010 --> 38:47.966
You can't escape it.
They don't get it from me,

38:48.020 --> 38:49.794
they'll get it
from someone else.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.660
- You won't get away with this.
- Just tell me

38:51.720 --> 38:53.665
where my pills are!

38:53.720 --> 38:55.847
- Mr. Shade!

38:55.890 --> 38:57.846
Thank God you found
Holly's drugs.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.845
I really appreciate
you helping me find her.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.368
- Drop the act, Gabe.
We all know these are yours.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.468
- Well I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.499
That's why he's not
telling the truth.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.949
- Look, it's one thing
to be a user, Holly,

39:09.990 --> 39:11.901
but dealing is something
I can't tolerate.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.998
Not when these things
get in the hands of kids.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.167
- Wow. The way you turn it
on and off,

39:16.220 --> 39:18.176
that's impressive, man.

39:18.220 --> 39:20.609
- Whatever you think
you're doing, stop.

39:20.660 --> 39:23.743
You got nothing.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.576
- I don't.

39:25.620 --> 39:27.793
But that does.

39:27.840 --> 39:31.059
External microphone.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.443
Highly sensitive.
Caught the whole thing.

39:33.500 --> 39:37.061
- Smile! You're
on candid camera.

39:46.290 --> 39:47.370
- DROP THE WEAPON!

39:51.950 --> 39:54.259
GET YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

40:11.670 --> 40:14.480
Well... the kid was right.

40:14.540 --> 40:17.236
I'm... I'm sorry.
But the next time you pull

40:17.280 --> 40:19.236
something like this,
maybe you give me a call first?

40:19.280 --> 40:21.532
- Just tell us
the recording checked out.

40:21.590 --> 40:23.808
- Loud and clear.

40:23.850 --> 40:25.806
Be careful with that thing.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.805
- I told you
that external mic you bought

40:29.860 --> 40:31.816
would come in handy one day!
- The Bedford Falcon

40:31.860 --> 40:34.909
flies again.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.770
- I didn't mean to yell at you.

40:43.830 --> 40:46.082
I'm the one
that should apologize.

40:51.970 --> 40:54.438
- I'm scared to reach out
to him again.

40:54.490 --> 40:56.446
That's why I overreacted
to you back there.

40:56.490 --> 40:58.355
I'm sorry.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.494
- Nothin' that a little
macaroni pie can't cure.

41:09.510 --> 41:11.501
- You know that number
you found for Noah?

41:11.550 --> 41:14.155
Do you still have it?

41:24.170 --> 41:27.344
- It's a great party.
Thanks for having us.
- Thanks for coming.

41:27.390 --> 41:30.564
This is what
the suburbs are about:

41:30.610 --> 41:32.953
the community, the camaraderie.

41:33.010 --> 41:35.649
- Next thing you know, you'll be
making us play bocce ball.

41:35.710 --> 41:39.009
- Hey! I never got the chance
to properly thank you two.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.221
You saved more than just me; you
saved the whole neighbourhood.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.748
- Actually, the credit
goes to this young man

41:43.800 --> 41:46.621
right here.
- Thank you, Tyler.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.400
You and your crazy flying robot
are true heroes.

41:49.460 --> 41:52.509
- The pleasure's all mine,
Ms. Brown. Although...

41:52.550 --> 41:54.711
regrettably, the Bedford Falcon
has been grounded.

41:54.770 --> 41:58.240
- Well, you never know.
People might change their minds.

41:58.290 --> 42:00.599
Besides, there's more to life
than flying a drone.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.983
- That's debatable.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.201
- I'm gonna go dance.

42:05.260 --> 42:07.512
- Take me on a mission
Sweep me on a sunset holiday

42:07.560 --> 42:10.779
- There's an opening on the
bocce ball court. Come on.

42:10.830 --> 42:12.991
- No. No!
- Come on! Come on!

42:15.830 --> 42:17.821
- Forget to be uptight

42:17.880 --> 42:21.350
Just keep rising up

42:21.400 --> 42:24.358
I want to feel you
by my side

42:24.410 --> 42:27.368
And go together
Searching for something true

42:27.410 --> 42:29.366
- Yeah!
- Wow!

42:31.850 --> 42:34.899
- Sunken through

42:37.250 --> 42:39.195
Searching for something true

42:44.560 --> 42:46.516
Something true

42:50.520 --> 42:52.772
Something true

42:55.090 --> 42:57.046
Something true

43:01.100 --> 43:03.660
- The Bedford Falcon
flies again!

43:03.710 --> 43:05.666
- Something true

43:07.670 --> 43:09.626
Something true

43:12.150 --> 43:14.402
Something true

43:19.420 --> 43:22.378
Something true
