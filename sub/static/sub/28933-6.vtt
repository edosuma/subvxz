WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:04.917
Previously onInstinct...DYLAN: Well, that would
suggest an escalation,

00:04.961 --> 00:07.964
and we would be witnessing
the birth of a serial killer.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.748
We need to find this guy,
like, today.

00:09.792 --> 00:13.578
I thought I saw some sparks
between you and Lizzie.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.102
She's out of my league.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.582
What happened?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.193
I can't talk about it.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.411
LIZZIE:
I can't live like this.

00:20.455 --> 00:24.372
It's why I...
need to walk away from us.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.417
She said, "I would like
to meet to talk about

00:26.461 --> 00:27.766
the possibility of adoption."

00:27.810 --> 00:29.072
Oh, I love that sentence.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.639
I love every word,
even the punctuation.

00:30.682 --> 00:33.076
Will you be this baby's parents?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.686
Yes.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.081
RYAN:
He killed again.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.561

01:41.188 --> 01:42.450
Big Papa?

01:42.493 --> 01:45.148
[gasps] Ooh. Sire?Sire?

01:45.192 --> 01:46.932
I'm not a feudal lord.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.631
How about something outside
the box, like "Dad"?

01:49.674 --> 01:52.024
Thought I was "Dad."
Our baby can't have two dads.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.984
Hey.
You know what I mean.

01:55.027 --> 01:57.160
Well, anyway, Sam has
still six months to go,

01:57.204 --> 01:58.857
so unless this baby
comes out talking,

01:58.901 --> 02:00.816
we have some time
to figure it out.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.165
We always do.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.036
You know, I still can't believe
how lucky we are

02:04.080 --> 02:05.734
with Sam and this adoption.

02:05.777 --> 02:09.868
I can't believe that we'll soon
be having breakfast for three.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.610
Oh, God, you have no idea how
many ways we can kill this baby.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.569
Oh, please, tell me.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.180
Aside from cow's milk and nuts,
babies can't have honey.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.182
What?It can harbor spores,

02:19.226 --> 02:20.531
which multiply
in the baby's intestines

02:20.575 --> 02:22.359
and develop into
infant botulism.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.188
Sounds like the worst
Pixar movie ever.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.103
Why the panic?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.061
Because six months will fly by.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.889
We have so much baby prep to do.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.848
Well, we can divide and conquer.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.198
You don't have time
to divide, let alone conquer.

02:35.242 --> 02:39.376
Between your catching killers,
teaching, writing your new book.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.683
I'm pushing back the
delivery of my book.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.467
Joan's vacation in Paris

02:43.511 --> 02:45.469
inspired her to
write her memoirs.
Ooh.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.079
She's extended her
trip indefinitely,

02:47.123 --> 02:49.081
and she won't be
bugging me for a while.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.779
Won't they just assign you
another editor?

02:50.822 --> 02:52.781
Mm. They already have.
Harry Kassabian.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.435
He's been trying
to set up a meeting,

02:54.478 --> 02:55.958
but I've been
avoiding his calls.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.090
Well, does he know how close
you are to being done?

02:59.831 --> 03:01.224
I haven't started.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.660
What? You write every night.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.923
How...? You got to have
something to show for it.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.970
Mm. Stray thoughts
and the words, "writing sucks,"

03:08.013 --> 03:10.755
typed resentfully
again and again and again.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.148
Maybe I can help.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.628
Be a good distraction

03:13.671 --> 03:15.760
from imagining all
the life-threatening things

03:15.804 --> 03:17.675
we could unknowingly inflict
on our child.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.590
You know how many hours I spent

03:19.634 --> 03:21.070
going over bloodless prose
as a lawyer.

03:21.113 --> 03:24.552
Not that your prose
is bloodless, though.

03:24.595 --> 03:29.121
Thanks, but I'll
figure it out.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.515
[sighs] Right.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.957
Looks like you slept
better than I did.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.264
The perks of makeup.
[chuckles]

03:41.308 --> 03:42.961
All last night,
I couldn't get your words,

03:43.005 --> 03:45.921
"I need to walk away from
this," out of my head.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.576
I have a bad habit of keeping
more secrets than I need to.

03:48.619 --> 03:49.707
Gee, you think?

03:49.751 --> 03:52.014
Okay, here it is.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.367
I had to burn my former cover
because someone's after me.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.240
The precinct offered me
a secure place to work,

04:00.283 --> 04:02.154
and it allowed me
to be near you.

04:02.198 --> 04:05.114
Someone is after you? Who?

04:05.157 --> 04:06.376
I don't know.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.249
Is it the same someone
who, um, broke your ribs

04:09.292 --> 04:10.467
wherever you were?

04:10.511 --> 04:12.339
I was in Istanbul,

04:12.382 --> 04:15.167
tailing a former
CIA operative

04:15.211 --> 04:17.344
who may be involved.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.171
Now you know everything.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.956
Sorry if I'm not responding.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.001
This is a lot to digest.
I, um...

04:23.045 --> 04:27.571
Maybe I need some time
away from... to think.

04:27.615 --> 04:28.964
Of course.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.315
One more thing.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.840
This is my last day
here at the precinct.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.842
I thought that would be best.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.497
Anything else
before I get to work?

04:40.541 --> 04:43.239
I think that just
about covers it.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.201
DYLAN:
To fully understand

04:49.245 --> 04:50.768
the behavior
of the Sleeping Beauty killer,

04:50.812 --> 04:52.292
I think we need to go back.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.598
Back all the way to Nebraska.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.208
Ken Rego was killed

04:56.252 --> 04:58.689
in what seems to be
a heat-of-the-moment

04:58.733 --> 05:00.256
passion murder.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.215
Then the killer feels remorse,
and so he lays Ken to rest

05:03.259 --> 05:05.696
in a makeshift blanket
and pillow.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.698
Then the killer moves
to New York.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.005
Was the remorse
unbearable?

05:10.048 --> 05:12.181
Was he fleeing
his guilt?

05:12.224 --> 05:15.619
Two weeks ago,
18 months after the Rego murder,

05:15.663 --> 05:17.795
he meets Nancy Lee in a bar,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.884
learns that she spent
her summers in Nebraska,

05:19.928 --> 05:22.713
panics and kills her
using the same M.O.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.541
Ditto for the bartender, Moseby,

05:24.585 --> 05:26.543
who saw them together
that night.

05:26.587 --> 05:30.765
Yes, but for Moseby, he brings
his own blanket and pillow.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.681
That's where his identity
and M.O. evolves,

05:33.724 --> 05:35.683
his behavior changes.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.685
He begins to engage with us.

05:37.728 --> 05:41.036
First of all, through
the Polaroid with the message.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.690
Then more directly,
and recklessly,

05:42.733 --> 05:45.867
by infiltrating Ryan's
hotel room, showcasing

05:45.910 --> 05:47.738
his signature.

05:47.782 --> 05:53.265
Now, I think the cowboy motif
on the pillow and blanket

05:53.309 --> 05:55.006
signify something
meaningful.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.399
Does the iconography
tell us anything

05:56.443 --> 05:57.879
about the identity
of the killer?

05:57.922 --> 06:00.577
Any updates on the scene?

06:00.621 --> 06:03.232
CSU worked the area,
bagged the blanket, pillow,

06:03.275 --> 06:05.539
dusted for prints.RYAN: Lab techs
confirmed the blood

06:05.582 --> 06:07.976
found on the pillow
was from a cat.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.630
Cat. And here I didn't think

06:09.673 --> 06:11.283
I could hate this lowlife
any more.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.590
Any witnesses or CCTV?

06:13.634 --> 06:15.418
RYAN: Nothing yet, but
we're gonna go back

06:15.462 --> 06:16.854
to the area today
to check to see

06:16.898 --> 06:18.073
if there's any other footage.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.598
Why is the killer reaching out?

06:21.642 --> 06:24.775
Well, if he has a fragile ego,
as most serial killers do,

06:24.819 --> 06:26.777
by communicating with us,
he feels more powerful.

06:26.821 --> 06:30.302
And what do we communicate
to the public and the media?

06:30.346 --> 06:32.435
Nothing.We stay quiet.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.132
We control
the narrative.

06:34.176 --> 06:37.135
What this killer wants, maybe
more than anything, is oxygen.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.747
The more attention he gets,
the more powerful he feels,

06:39.790 --> 06:41.923
the more likely he is
to kill again.

06:41.966 --> 06:45.274
There's a body in
an art installation.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.146
JASMINE: Well, hold on
a second, Reinhart.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.627
You're on this case.
Can you handle both?

06:52.020 --> 06:54.370
Oh, I can walk, chew gum

06:54.414 --> 06:57.025
and write a paper on boanthropy
disorder at the same time.

06:57.068 --> 07:00.028
You say stuff like that just so
I don't want you around, right?

07:01.203 --> 07:02.509
Go.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.774
DYLAN: Excuse me. Excuse me.LIZZIE: Excuse us.

07:06.817 --> 07:09.080
Thank you.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.431
HARRIS: Witness reported finding
the body early this morning.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.172
So far, no prints, no DNA,
no trace evidence.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.870
We're running
the vic's I.D. right now.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.525
Thanks, Sarge. Whoa, we
got a live audience today.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.876
Yeah, people seem to think it's
the work of some dude named Ace.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.007
The street artist?

07:23.051 --> 07:24.487
Who is he?
Should I know him?

07:24.531 --> 07:27.534
A ghost. No one's ever seen him.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.060
Excuse us, guys. Excuse us.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.502
I guess I don't
get art these days.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.851
Suits,

07:40.895 --> 07:42.679
ready to feast.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.246
Greedy as pigs.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.988
In front of the Fed, a message
for all the world to see.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.121
This sure looks like an Ace.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.472
Does Ace usually put dead bodies
in his work?

07:52.515 --> 07:54.909
Aside from that.How can anyone do this

07:54.952 --> 07:56.084
without being seen?

07:56.127 --> 07:58.260
Oh, Ace has gotten
into the Louvre,

07:58.303 --> 07:59.870
he's climbed Big Ben
undetected.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.177
He's a master of stealth.

08:02.220 --> 08:05.310
In an age when everybody
wants to be seen,

08:05.354 --> 08:07.487
Ace has somehow
remained anonymous.

08:11.882 --> 08:15.495
Looks personal.
I count seven stab wounds.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.758
Seven?
Like the seven deadly sins,

08:17.801 --> 08:19.586
or the seventh day,
the day of rest.

08:19.629 --> 08:23.241
Or maybe it took seven stabs
to kill the guy.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.548
Ace's work has always
been political,

08:25.592 --> 08:28.159
message-based,
but never violent.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.553
Maybe it's a fake.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.990
We can start bagging now.

08:35.036 --> 08:37.429
What are you thinking?

08:37.473 --> 08:39.170
How we're gonna go about finding

08:39.214 --> 08:42.609
the most elusive artist
in the world.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.654
♪

08:55.056 --> 08:56.274
Let me guess.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.450
It's a statement about
a well-dressed baby

08:58.494 --> 09:00.931
deciding what to eat.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.412
I call it "War and Peas."

09:03.455 --> 09:04.892
[laughs]

09:04.935 --> 09:06.894
Which is why you install the art
and don't make it.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.460
Pete?

09:08.504 --> 09:09.723
Pete. I'd
appreciate it

09:09.766 --> 09:11.376
if you didn't talk to clients.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.552
JEFF:
Hear that,

09:12.595 --> 09:13.596
"Pete"?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.990
It's Paul. I'm so sorry.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.557
[woman chuckles]

09:17.600 --> 09:20.951
Hi. I'm Amber Williams.
Are you interested

09:20.995 --> 09:23.301
in an Ace?
In a way, yes.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.913
You've heard about the murder
in the Ace installation?

09:25.956 --> 09:28.611
I did. It's hard to believe
someone would do that.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.440
Someone?
You don't think it was Ace?

09:31.483 --> 09:35.313
No. Nothing in his art suggests
that kind of sensibility.

09:35.357 --> 09:38.099
So you know who Ace is?No.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.622
I've never met the man.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.624
He contacts me
through encrypted e-mail,

09:41.668 --> 09:43.452
tells me when
to expect a delivery.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.628
Payment is done via Bitcoin.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
You handle all of Ace's sales?

09:47.325 --> 09:49.893
I began selling Ace's work
seven years ago,

09:49.937 --> 09:52.417
when he was an unknown
and no one else would rep him.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.680
His last piece

09:53.723 --> 09:56.291
sold for 5.5 million.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.727
We'll need to look
at your records.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.163
Of course.

09:59.207 --> 10:02.123
So, do you think the
installation at the crime scene

10:02.166 --> 10:03.646
was an authentic Ace?

10:04.691 --> 10:07.650
It has all the hallmarks
of an Ace.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.478
Papier-mâché figures,

10:09.521 --> 10:11.785
impressionism,
a provocative statement.

10:11.828 --> 10:15.615
I-I just can't believe
he'd do this.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.965
I'm sure you have a way
to verify the pieces.

10:18.008 --> 10:21.011
There's only one way
to authenticate an Ace.

10:21.055 --> 10:24.232
Ace has a very specific
signature.

10:24.275 --> 10:27.888
He adds a splash of platinum to
the paint in all of his artwork.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.673
So, if you run a precious metal
detector over the piece

10:30.717 --> 10:34.068
and hear a beep,
you know it's an Ace.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.680
[beeping]

10:37.724 --> 10:39.116
DYLAN:
Verifying it's authentic

10:39.160 --> 10:41.858
is actually easier
than switching this thing off.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.861
But just because
it's a verified Ace

10:44.905 --> 10:46.646
doesn't mean that
he's the killer.

10:46.689 --> 10:50.650
True. But anonymity
can change a person's behavior.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.087
Ace has been breaking the law
in the name of art

10:53.130 --> 10:55.437
without any consequences
for years now.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.917
He may be more inclined
to commit murder

10:56.960 --> 10:58.614
if he thinks
he can get away with it.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.269
Right. People who live
in the shadows think

11:01.312 --> 11:03.793
they have a license to
do whatever they want.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.275
Thank God he's almost done here.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.972
Why "thank God"?

11:10.017 --> 11:12.019
We broke up last night.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.847
[quietly]:
What?

11:17.024 --> 11:19.069
Are you okay?

11:19.113 --> 11:22.290
I don't know
how Andy managed dating a spy,

11:22.333 --> 11:23.770
but I can't do it.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.119
Well, he didn't.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.817
Andy got me to leave the Agency.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.560
I'm sorry.

11:31.603 --> 11:32.735
I am, too.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.389
I just need to focus
on something else.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.652
Yeah, that's gonna be hard today
when you look up

11:36.696 --> 11:37.827
and he's right there.Yeah. Thank you.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.394
That is so helpful.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.832
ZACK: We got a hit
on your vic.

11:42.876 --> 11:45.748
Gustavo Cutillo, 33,
hedge fund manager.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.489
It explains "Greedy Pig."

11:47.532 --> 11:48.795
LIZZIE: Wall Street
has its fair share

11:48.838 --> 11:50.579
of greedy pigs.
Why target this one?

11:50.622 --> 11:53.538
If you two need any info on Ace,
ask Fucci.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.714
Wait, wait, what?

11:54.757 --> 11:55.976
Did you just say,

11:56.019 --> 11:57.934
if we need to ask questions
about art,

11:57.978 --> 11:59.849
we should direct them
to Detective Fucci,

11:59.893 --> 12:00.850
the man who has

12:00.894 --> 12:02.460
a framed picture

12:02.504 --> 12:05.202
of the New York Mets mascot
on his dining room wall?

12:05.246 --> 12:07.552
He has a name: Mr. Met.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.032
And Lou didn't say
ask me about art.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.818
She said ask me about Ace.
It's been my personal mission

12:11.861 --> 12:14.385
to nail that little dirtbag
ever since I was a beat cop.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.693
But every time we'd get close
to him, he seems to slip away.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.347
He's been my Captain Ahab.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.349
I think you mean
your white whale.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.829
Yeah, listen, Doc.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.179
Whatever. I don't want
to turn this into a race thing.

12:25.222 --> 12:28.356
All I know is that,
when I was a kid in Marine Park,

12:28.399 --> 12:30.358
if you spray-painted
a paddleball court,

12:30.401 --> 12:31.663
you were a vandal.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.317
Now you spray-paint
somebody's storefront,

12:33.361 --> 12:34.928
and you're a damn celebrity.

12:34.971 --> 12:38.148
Yeah, any useful information
that we should know?

12:38.192 --> 12:40.368
Oh, yeah. According
to my geographic profile,

12:40.411 --> 12:41.673
there's a good chance

12:41.717 --> 12:44.154
he lives
in Lower Manhattan.

12:44.198 --> 12:47.027
MAN: If the mountain
will not come to Muhammad,

12:47.070 --> 12:49.812
then Muhammad must go
to the mountain.

Heads up,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.342
I've been looking forward
to this.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.867
Since you've been avoiding me,
I'm guessing you haven't.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.825
No. No, I haven't been
avoiding you.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.696
No?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.873
Then I apologize.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.613
It's just not a great time.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.225
Oh, I'll be quick.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.662
Is there somewhere we can chat?

13:13.705 --> 13:15.664
Look, I know I owe you a book.

13:15.707 --> 13:18.101
And it's a book I want to write,
but I'm busy.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.582
And I know how busy you are
with all your amazing clients...

13:20.625 --> 13:24.107
Joan told me
about how charming you can be.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.240
Doesn't work on me.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.676
I'm charm-proof.

13:27.719 --> 13:28.895
Stick it in your book.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.331
FUCCI:
Oh, this is good.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.463
As much as I love
and cherish Dylan,

13:32.507 --> 13:34.683
I'm really enjoying this.

Do you see what I'm doing?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.693
Praying?

13:44.736 --> 13:46.869
I'm trying
to read your book,

13:46.913 --> 13:48.828
but something is preventing me.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.568
Tell me,

13:50.612 --> 13:53.267
why is there no book
in my hands?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.051
Because
I haven't written it yet.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.661
Because you're too busy.For now, yes.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.185
Funny, because
you're not too busy

13:58.228 --> 14:00.056

14:00.100 --> 14:02.015
DYLAN: Signing the name
on the back of a check

14:02.058 --> 14:03.886
takes considerably less time

14:03.930 --> 14:06.062
than writing a
75,000-word manuscript.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.324
Well, then you
better write fast

14:07.368 --> 14:08.499
and get your
priorities straight.

14:08.543 --> 14:09.936
Because if I don't get
that manuscript

14:09.979 --> 14:11.198
by the end of the week,

14:11.241 --> 14:13.809
your deal
goes bye-bye.

Turns out our vic

14:32.088 --> 14:34.134
Gustavo's hedge fund
looks like a shell company.

14:34.177 --> 14:35.918
Home and office addresses
are the same.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.920
He may have been
laundering money.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.835
Maybe that's why Ace
targeted him.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
We'll check it out.

There was a break-in

capture any of the street here?

Nah. Just looks
into the coffee shop.

You're absolutely sure

15:04.991 --> 15:06.601
that it doesn't capture
this angle over here?

15:06.644 --> 15:07.863
No. No.

None of that.

'Cause, based on Zack's info,

15:59.480 --> 16:01.438
the vic wasn't trying
to make his clients money.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.440
Maybe he was ripping them off.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.441
Ponzi scheme?

16:04.485 --> 16:05.616
Maybe Ace was
a client,

16:05.660 --> 16:07.270
and he murdered him

That's some message.

Gustavo was Ace.

So, the person
we thought was our killer

17:30.440 --> 17:33.443
is actually our victim.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.456
According to Gustavo's
travel records, he was in Rome

17:46.500 --> 17:49.155
when a major Ace installation
went up at the Pantheon.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.852
Same with Rio,
Prague, Jerusalem.

17:50.895 --> 17:51.853
He was Ace.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.595
The hedge fund manager
was a cover.

If he used the shell

he made as an artist,
frankly, it's brilliant.

He was also a romantic.

Maybe Syl knows why he

Plus, they need to know a thing
or two about street art.

So, another artist?

18:54.611 --> 18:56.613
Artists have feuded

18:56.657 --> 18:59.486
Michelangelo had
a vicious rivalry with da Vinci.

It led to a bitter

Take him to the box.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.561
What's his story?FUCCI: Caught him
snooping around

19:31.605 --> 19:34.042
his hotel room. Hasn't
said a single word yet.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.348
RYAN:
Uh, Dylan,

19:35.391 --> 19:38.046
we could use your
interrogation magic in there.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.570
His "magic"?
Wow, you guys are adorable.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.312
All you need's
a chocolate malt and two straws.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.531
I hope you don't mind
sharing me.

19:44.574 --> 19:45.662
There is enough to go around.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.055
Magic or ego?

19:47.098 --> 19:48.839
This could be a big break
in the case.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.406
LIZZIE: Okay, well,
fire up that magic.

19:50.450 --> 19:53.279
I'll handle Davies
all by myself.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.238
Preposterous.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.589
You think I placed a body
in his art installation

19:59.633 --> 20:01.548
in front of the bloody Fed

20:01.591 --> 20:03.245
to get back at him?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.812
No way.

20:04.855 --> 20:07.510
After reading your tweets,
doesn't sound too crazy to me.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.338
Take a look around, my love.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.948
Uh, Detective Needham.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.777
I'm preparing
for the Claridge Art Gala.

20:13.821 --> 20:17.694
I'm clearly too busy
to kill anyone right now.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.348
Although I might have an opening

20:19.392 --> 20:22.612
next Thursday at
4:00, however.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.962
Smile.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.529
Life is short.

20:26.573 --> 20:29.445
Ask that poor guy
in the installation.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.361
So you and Ace weren't feuding?

20:32.405 --> 20:35.538
Not everything
you read online is true.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.758
The feud wasn't real.

20:37.801 --> 20:40.891
I don't hate him or his work.

20:40.935 --> 20:44.417
It was manufactured
for exposure, dear.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.028
Ace calling me
"a no-talent Muppet"

20:47.071 --> 20:49.552
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

20:49.596 --> 20:52.033
Why would Ace
want to help you?

20:52.076 --> 20:55.471
A close friend said
she would set up a feud

20:55.515 --> 20:58.039
and convince Ace
to go along with it.

20:58.082 --> 21:01.216
Next thing I know,
Ace is calling me out online.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.305
I owe her my career.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.872
I'm gonna need her name.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.961
Sylvia Mau.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.093
She runs the blog Vandal Life.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.139
Documents Ace's work.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.491
Thank you, Mr. Davies.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.928
Don't leave town. You're
still a person of interest.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.669
I'm flattered.Yeah.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.715
It's not a compliment.

21:23.978 --> 21:26.459
This is Dennis Walker.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.765
What were you looking for
in my room?

21:30.767 --> 21:33.292
Wow. He takes his right

21:33.335 --> 21:36.730
to remain silent very seriously.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.340
Since you don't want to answer
any questions,

21:38.384 --> 21:40.211
is there anything
you'd like to ask us?

21:43.258 --> 21:45.216
Who's Sleeping Beauty?

21:45.260 --> 21:47.871
It's written on the
wall of your hotel room

21:47.915 --> 21:49.569
with all those
crime scene photos.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.926
Take it off.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.672
Dennis Walker.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.674
I knew I remembered
that name.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.806
And that voice. Our friend here

22:09.850 --> 22:11.199
has a very popular
true crime podcast,

22:11.242 --> 22:13.506
which I happen to enjoy.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.029
You're a fan?

22:15.072 --> 22:17.161
Mm, of the podcast.

22:17.205 --> 22:19.033
How many victims
are there so far?

22:19.076 --> 22:20.513
Do you have any suspects?

22:20.556 --> 22:22.253
How did you know
to go to my room?

22:22.297 --> 22:23.559
I don't reveal my sources.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.779
They gave me a hotel address
and a room number.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.302
I had no idea what it was

22:27.346 --> 22:29.391
until I got there and saw
blood on the mattress.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.263
Dennis, you do realize we're
trying to catch a murderer here

22:32.307 --> 22:34.178
before another victim dies?

22:34.222 --> 22:35.484
I understand.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.356
Who is Sleeping Beauty?
The killer?

22:37.399 --> 22:39.793
We don't discuss
open investigations.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.316
DYLAN:
Dennis,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.013
who's your source?

22:43.057 --> 22:45.364
It's a private number.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.192
No name.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.759
Are you happy?

22:49.803 --> 22:52.980
I could get my audience to
crowd-solve this case with you.

22:53.023 --> 22:56.636
This could be good
for all of us.

22:56.679 --> 22:57.724
RYAN:
I'll trace the number,

22:57.767 --> 22:59.813
but it's probably
a burner phone.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.423
Either way,
I say we hold him,

23:01.467 --> 23:02.990
get him to talk
off record.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.948
Maybe he knows more.Yeah.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.777
The main thing right now
is for Dennis to stay quiet.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.692
Tell him, if he agrees
not to go public,

23:09.736 --> 23:11.433
we will guarantee him
exclusive scoops

23:11.477 --> 23:14.175
at the appropriate time.So you want to
cut him loose?

23:14.218 --> 23:16.612
Yes, but you follow him;
make sure he stays safe.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.440
We don't want
another victim on our hands.

23:19.746 --> 23:22.139
You recognized his voice?Hmm.

23:22.183 --> 23:23.532
I have a phonographic memory.

23:23.576 --> 23:24.794
A what?[door opens]

23:24.838 --> 23:26.970
Reinhart, another
body dropped.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.276
This time in
an art gallery.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.147
Needham will meet you there.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.982
So, "love letters Syl"
was an art blogger

23:39.026 --> 23:40.506
who was at the first crime scene

23:40.549 --> 23:42.856
and was having
a relationship with Gustavo.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.379
I'd say that makes her
a suspect.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.166
Made her a suspect.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.348
Cupid, roses, a silk sheet.

23:57.392 --> 24:00.047
DYLAN: New victim,
new theme: "Love is blind."

24:00.090 --> 24:02.005
A couple is dating,
both in the art world,

24:02.049 --> 24:03.267
both end up dead.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.792
Spurned lover, spouse, rival?

24:05.835 --> 24:07.446
Did you count the stab wounds?

24:07.489 --> 24:09.622
No. Did you?

24:09.665 --> 24:13.103
[stammers] It's just,
you did last time. I mean...

24:14.627 --> 24:16.759
Fine, I'll do it.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.067
Thank you.

24:20.110 --> 24:22.199
One, two... [mutters]

24:22.243 --> 24:24.158
14. Hmm.

24:24.201 --> 24:25.638
Number 14 represents
personal freedom.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.291
Of course, 14 is also
St. Valentine's Day,

24:27.335 --> 24:28.902
so it might
have to do with love,

24:28.945 --> 24:32.079
or of course it could have
neither meaning.I have a question.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.298
How is our killer
making Ace installations

24:34.342 --> 24:36.387
when Ace is dead?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.128
Perhaps it's someone
from Ace's world

24:38.172 --> 24:40.087
who didn't
want them together.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.784
Or it could be someone

24:41.828 --> 24:44.178
who might profit
from the attention.

24:45.962 --> 24:49.618
I came back to close up
when I saw her there.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.534
I followed Sylvia's
blog. We all did.

24:52.578 --> 24:53.796
It's horrible.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.147
And no one saw anything unusual?No.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.846
Lots of people have been
coming in and out all day.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.500
The Claridge Art
Gala is tonight.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.066
It's the biggest art
night of the year,

25:03.110 --> 25:04.372
and I'm presenting.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.593
I was at the venue for
a rehearsal and...

25:07.636 --> 25:08.768
came back to this.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.771
Have you seen
this work before?
No.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.208
It's new and, frankly,
unimpressive.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.949
It's a little convoluted.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.951
Muddled theme,
sloppy brush work.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.214
And the mutilated corpse
in the middle of it?

25:20.257 --> 25:23.260
Honestly, it's the only
thing notable about it.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.784
Mm, I'm sure your gallery's
gonna get

25:24.827 --> 25:26.133
a lot of attention from this.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.396
I would think so.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.576
You're not thinking
I had something to do with this?

25:34.620 --> 25:36.622
Yes, we are.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.667
This is not the type
of attention I want.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.060
This is a nightmare.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.496
Check with the people
at the venue.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.063
They saw me there.
I didn't do anything.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.587
Okay, thank you.
One more question.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.721
Do you know of any relationship
between Sylvia and Ace?

25:48.764 --> 25:50.897
No. If she was dating Ace,

25:50.940 --> 25:53.290
she's as good
at keeping secrets as he is.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.857
Thank you.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.513
Thank you.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.690
Nah.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.388
She seems genuinely horrified.
I don't think it was her.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.999
Her alibi will be easy to check,

26:06.042 --> 26:08.175
but if it's not her
and it's not Sylvia,

26:08.218 --> 26:12.005
then we have no suspect,
no witnesses, no leads, no one.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.529
Just two dead bodies
in two staged installations.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.923
Staged, like
the Sleeping Beauty victims.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.751
We're talking
about this case.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.491
There are two reasons
to stage a body.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.319
One is for attention;
the other reflects

26:22.363 --> 26:24.931
a deep emotional desire
of the killer.

26:26.846 --> 26:29.152
Sleeping Beauty's stagings
are regretful.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.719
This killer is an artist.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.592
His central motif
is dead bodies.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.247
Gustavo was depicted
as a greedy pig.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.293
And Sylvia as a fallen angel,

26:39.336 --> 26:42.557
lured into the darkness,
punished for her love.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.429
Punished for the secret
they were keeping?
Yes.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.868
We need to learn more
about their relationship.

26:48.911 --> 26:51.305
If she was writing him
love letters,

26:51.348 --> 26:53.612
I bet he wrote her some, too.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.573
Gustavo lived like a king,
and Sylvia like...[blows raspberry]

26:58.617 --> 26:59.748
A starving artist.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.446
Maybe she needed
money; he had it.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.319
The same blueprints
Gustavo had.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.932
These are painted.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.456
Same technique
as the installations.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.502
She wasn't just
his girlfriend

27:14.545 --> 27:16.112
or another artist.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.419
Sylvia was Ace, too.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.899
They were partners.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.901
I'll bet Gustavo did
the human figures.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.424
Uh, he was the sculptor.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.469
And then the detail,
the-the skilled hand,

27:25.513 --> 27:27.646
that was was all Sylvia.
She was the painter.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.909
And the killer knew
both their covers.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.781
Here's a love letter
from Gustavo

27:32.825 --> 27:34.870
from just a few days ago.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.437
"Syl, we can't
keep hiding like this.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.744
"Our art is bigger than Ace.
We need to come out.

27:38.787 --> 27:42.138
Please stand by me in this
decision. Love, G."

27:42.182 --> 27:44.271
Blind love.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.752
They lived their lives
in secrecy for their art,

27:46.795 --> 27:48.188
and now they wanted out.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.016
And someone killed them
before they had a chance

27:50.059 --> 27:51.452
to reveal themselves.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.236
Someone who wanted control
of the Ace brand

27:53.280 --> 27:56.065
or a jealous rival.His artistic rival.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.328
Dexter Davies.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.374
Maybe he knew more
than he let on.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.158
I'll check out his alibi.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.350
[phone buzzing]

28:20.394 --> 28:21.656
Hey.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.962
DYLAN:
Any updates?

28:23.005 --> 28:24.528
I've been tracking
this guy all day.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.530
No signs he's being followed.

28:26.574 --> 28:27.836
Maybe you should
let someone else

28:27.880 --> 28:29.098
take over for the night.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.447
I'm good.
You know, I've been

28:30.491 --> 28:31.971
catching up
on this guy's podcast.

28:32.014 --> 28:35.670
He... I mean,
he really loves killers.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.498
It almost makes me like him.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.849
Okay, talk soon.Yeah.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.374
Sorry to disturb
your writing.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.637
I'm not writing.

28:46.681 --> 28:49.466
I had a feeling. Here.What's this?

28:49.510 --> 28:52.165
All those stray thoughts and
random notes on your desk.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.515
I've organized them into
something resembling

28:54.558 --> 28:56.865
the beginnings of a
semi-coherent idea.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.651
Andy, this book is about me,

29:00.695 --> 29:02.741
and it's supposed to be
written by me,

29:02.784 --> 29:05.787
and I didn't ask for your help.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.397
You never do.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.399
I know you
thrive on wearing

29:09.443 --> 29:12.881
all your hats at once, but...
it's okay to take one off.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.014
I-I won't think any less of you.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.537
In fact, just the opposite.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.365
Is this any good?

29:18.408 --> 29:19.714
No.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.890
It's terrible, but it's a start.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.197
Look, I'm not a writer,
but I was a marketing major

29:24.240 --> 29:25.546
before I switched
to pre-law.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.809
At least let me come up
with some catchy message

29:27.853 --> 29:30.725
that'll distract Kassabian from
the lack of an actual book.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.379
Message.

29:32.422 --> 29:34.294
That's what I'm missing.

29:34.337 --> 29:37.863
All Ace's work had a message:
uh, words,

29:37.906 --> 29:40.039
titles, a provocative
point of view.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.431
What if Ace...

29:42.476 --> 29:44.739
...was a trio
and the third artist

29:44.783 --> 29:48.787
supplied... the message?

29:48.830 --> 29:51.224
So I helped.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.574
You always do, even when
I don't ask for it.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.577
Thanks, Big Papa.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.623
I'm Dad, okay?
I am definitely Dad.

30:06.282 --> 30:08.241
Hey.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.243
I'm finishing up my
final scan of the system.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.810
Then I'll head out.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.771
So, I thought about
what you told me,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.382
and I have one question.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.081
Were you open with me

30:22.124 --> 30:23.909
because you're trying
to be more honest

30:23.952 --> 30:26.694
or because you thought
it could get us back together?

30:26.737 --> 30:30.524
After everything I told you,
that's what you want to know?

30:30.567 --> 30:32.526
Yes.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.789
You asked me to be
more forthright with you

30:34.833 --> 30:36.791
about what I do.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.967
Now you question my motives?

30:39.011 --> 30:40.926
Why you're telling me
about your work

30:40.969 --> 30:43.189
is just as important
as what you're telling me.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.191
It's one and the same.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.193
What happens next time
there's a secret

30:47.236 --> 30:49.978
that you feel like
you need to keep?

30:50.022 --> 30:52.459
I'll miss Jules.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.156
And I'll miss seeing
you two together.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.897
Not now, Dylan.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.856
But I won't miss the drama.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.076
Good-bye, Detective Needham.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.995
Good-bye.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.487
Just curious.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.489
In a post-breakup world,

31:22.532 --> 31:25.100
how much longer will Julian
still be working with us?

31:25.144 --> 31:26.493
It's already way too long.

31:26.536 --> 31:27.668
Okay, too soon. Got it.

31:27.711 --> 31:28.930
Do you want to
hear my theory?

31:28.974 --> 31:30.976
If I say "no,"
you're gonna tell me anyway.

31:31.019 --> 31:33.326
Hmm. So, we know Ace was
more than one artist,

31:33.369 --> 31:35.328
but what if he was
more than two?

31:35.371 --> 31:37.286
Gustavo sculpted,
Sylvia painted,

31:37.330 --> 31:39.506
but we haven't accounted
for the political messages.

31:39.549 --> 31:42.074
They gave Ace's
work meaning.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.772
So you think there could be
at least one more member of Ace?

31:44.815 --> 31:46.426
Davies?

31:46.469 --> 31:48.428
No, his alibi is rock solid.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.908
But I did find
another connection

31:49.951 --> 31:51.735
between Sylvia and Gustavo.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.999
They met at City College
in 2007

31:54.042 --> 31:56.523
right before Ace's work
started showing up around town.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.351
Well, maybe that's where they
started working together.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.005
We need a list
of the students

32:00.048 --> 32:03.269
and all their classes
over four years.

32:03.312 --> 32:05.401
One for old times' sake?

32:07.751 --> 32:11.538
Sure. This won't be
uncomfortable at all.

32:13.018 --> 32:16.021
I've narrowed down the
classes from the back cache

32:16.064 --> 32:18.545
of the school's database
to find the art class

32:18.588 --> 32:20.590
Gustavo and Sylvia
took together

32:20.634 --> 32:22.201
sophomore year.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.377
DYLAN:
Hmm. A virtual museum

32:24.420 --> 32:26.379
of the student's artwork.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.991
That looks like a Gustavo
papier-mâché sculpture.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.732
DYLAN:
Yeah. And that
looks like

32:31.775 --> 32:33.212
a Sylvia painting.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.388
No.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.259
Go back.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.045
Zoom in.

32:40.088 --> 32:42.743
DYLAN:
A classic Ace
political message.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.745
In the same font Ace used.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.616
From a student
named Paul Wexford.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.010
Hey. Paul?
Wasn't that the name

32:49.054 --> 32:50.446
of the art installer
at the gallery?

32:50.490 --> 32:51.970
The one Amber
called Pete?

32:52.013 --> 32:53.406
Can you, uh, pull up

32:53.449 --> 32:54.624
more information
on him, please?

32:54.668 --> 32:57.236
I'm already on it.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.325
LIZZIE:
Yes, that's him.
You're right.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.110
He knew
about Ace's work,

33:02.154 --> 33:04.069
and he could set it up
in Amber's gallery.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.722
And stage Sylvia's body there.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.507
Can you text us?

33:07.550 --> 33:09.813
You both have his address.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.513
Thanks, Julian.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.692
♪

33:44.500 --> 33:46.937
[sighs]

33:46.981 --> 33:50.028
The safe haven
of someone who's lost control.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.988
Props from both crime scenes.

33:57.861 --> 34:02.649
2008 to 2019. Do you think
Paul wanted to end Ace?

34:02.692 --> 34:05.652
The seventh day,
the day of rest. Hmm?

34:05.695 --> 34:07.828
You were listening.Huh.

34:12.006 --> 34:13.877
Or not resting.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.357
Take a look at this.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.148
Looks like Paul wanted to
take Ace in a new direction.

34:23.191 --> 34:25.672
And by putting dead
bodies in the artwork,

34:25.715 --> 34:28.066
he was redefining
Ace's identity.

34:28.109 --> 34:31.373
But he thinks he can kill his
partners and still be Ace? How?

34:31.417 --> 34:34.333
Well, his inflated sense
of self-worth and identity.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.509
Those are the symptoms
of a delusional disorder.

34:36.552 --> 34:39.512
Still, they've been Ace
for years. Why kill now?

34:39.555 --> 34:42.863
Well, that sort of disorder can
be triggered by intense stress.

34:42.906 --> 34:45.257
If Paul wanted
to keep the secret of Ace,

34:45.300 --> 34:47.563
but Gustavo and Sylvia
were sick of the anonymity

34:47.607 --> 34:50.088
and wanted to come out,
it may well

34:50.131 --> 34:51.219
have triggered it.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.916
Ace is reborn.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.875
If Paul is deluded,
he may think

34:54.918 --> 34:58.052
he could keep killing and
hide in plain sight forever.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.141
Amber's presenting
the opening exhibit

35:00.185 --> 35:01.751
at the Claridge
Art Gala tonight.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.971
And we both know
who's installing it.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.114
Paul.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.680
This isn't the Ace
we're showing.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.595
This is what Ace wants.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.903
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy to be here.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.426
I just hate his art.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.517
Paul, you're under arrest.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.606
[groaning]I don't think so.

35:30.650 --> 35:31.912
No! No!Hey, put it down.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.174
[whimpering]

35:34.349 --> 35:35.959
Keep your voices down.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.353
We know the secret.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.964
You're Ace. So was
Gustavo and Sylvia.

35:41.008 --> 35:42.966
They wanted to come out,
so you killed them.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.968
They said they didn't need me,

35:45.012 --> 35:46.666
that they could make art
without Ace.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.189
I couldn't let them.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.322
Yes, Gustavo and Sylvia
didn't listen,

35:50.365 --> 35:53.760
but Amber didn't
do anything wrong.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.937
She treated me like a nobody
when I made her career.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.678
Remember that?

35:58.721 --> 36:00.201
How could she?
You didn't tell her.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.682
You didn't tell anyone.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.163
Ace,

36:05.206 --> 36:07.426
let her go.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.950
She's my next exhibit.

36:09.993 --> 36:11.952
AMBER [whimpering]:
No...

36:13.823 --> 36:15.782
The gala's about to begin.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.914
When the people behind that door

36:17.958 --> 36:21.614
find out that the great Ace
is just Paul Wexford,

36:21.657 --> 36:24.704
an art installer,
Ace will not be reborn;

36:24.747 --> 36:26.836
Ace will be dead.

36:30.840 --> 36:35.889
Let her go,
and we will keep your secret.

36:36.933 --> 36:38.935
[crying]:
No!

36:40.198 --> 36:42.156
No!

36:44.680 --> 36:46.552
Drop the knife, Paul.
Drop the knife.

36:50.295 --> 36:53.907
Fucci, you want
the honors?

36:53.950 --> 36:55.561
You know I do.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.825
I've waited
a long time for this.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.088
Put your hands behind your back.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.178
Get up.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.399
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

37:10.053 --> 37:11.446
Going to see your editor?

37:11.490 --> 37:13.318
When do you have time
to write a book?

37:13.361 --> 37:14.841
I'll find time.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.409
Need I remind you I have already
had a book published?

37:17.452 --> 37:20.412
You needn't,
and it was quite good,

37:20.455 --> 37:22.152
but you weren't solving murders

37:22.196 --> 37:23.937
or expecting a baby
when you wrote it.

37:23.980 --> 37:26.331
Now you sound like Andy.

37:26.374 --> 37:29.116
There are worse people
to sound like.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.772
Well, I don't want
to hold you up

37:32.815 --> 37:35.862
from writing
the next best seller.

37:35.905 --> 37:38.343
Last night,
there was a failed DDOS attack

37:38.386 --> 37:40.258
on the precinct's server.

37:40.301 --> 37:43.217
I can't identify
where the threat came from,

37:43.261 --> 37:45.524
but I believe
it'll be attempted again.

37:45.567 --> 37:46.873
What's it capable of?

37:46.916 --> 37:48.875
Complete control
of the NYPD network

37:48.918 --> 37:51.530
and the ability
to make it inaccessible.

37:51.573 --> 37:52.966
Do you think
someone traced you?

37:53.009 --> 37:54.315
It's possible,

37:54.359 --> 37:57.797
but I took
all the necessary precautions.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.320
It's neutralized for now,

37:59.364 --> 38:01.975
but it could spread
across the network.

38:02.018 --> 38:06.719
So it looks like you won't be
leaving the precinct after all.

38:06.762 --> 38:10.070
And I've already said
good-bye to all the chaps.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.593
And to Lizzie.

38:13.160 --> 38:16.206
In more ways than one.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.557
I really thought
I could manage it.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.909
Being in a relationship,
being a spy,

38:22.952 --> 38:25.955
Jules.

38:25.999 --> 38:31.265
But by trying to be everyone,
I ended up as no one.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.137
And I think I lost her.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.537
We set a meeting,
and you actually showed.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.191
That's a start.

38:44.234 --> 38:46.367
Are there pages
in there?

38:46.411 --> 38:49.239
Joan told me you were fast.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.331
What's that?

38:53.374 --> 38:55.333
Your money back.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.030
I know I gave you my...

38:57.073 --> 39:00.163
well, technically gave Joan
my word, and signed a contract,

39:00.207 --> 39:02.514
but I don't have the time
to make good on it,

39:02.557 --> 39:04.472
and I don't want
to hand in a book

39:04.516 --> 39:06.996
that isn't good.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.782
So you want me to let you out
of your contract?

39:09.825 --> 39:11.827
Yes.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.743
There are more
important things

39:14.787 --> 39:16.919
I can't risk losing.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.661
Sorry.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.837
How long do you need?

39:21.881 --> 39:23.796
Oh, I don't think you understand
what I'm saying.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.188
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.802
I set that deadline
to motivate you.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.281
I don't want that check.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.501
I want your book.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.111
I'll wait if I have to.

39:35.155 --> 39:38.724
But when you deliver it...

39:38.767 --> 39:41.030
better be a masterpiece.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.077
Get out of here.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.997
You're still here?

39:51.040 --> 39:53.347
I can see why
you're a detective.

39:53.391 --> 39:58.047
I thought you ran your
final thingamabob last night.

39:58.091 --> 40:01.050
It seems my exit strategy is
not going according to plan.

40:01.094 --> 40:05.054
In my final scan,
I found a breach in the system.

40:05.098 --> 40:07.230
A sophisticated malware bot.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.407
A malware bot?

40:09.450 --> 40:12.497
Yes. I'm going to have to design
a more advanced thingamabob.

40:12.540 --> 40:17.197
Perhaps even, dare I say, a
cutting-edge whosamawhatsit.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.851
What does that mean?

40:18.894 --> 40:23.333
I'm not sure yet, but it could
be targeting me or the NYPD.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.771
So you're not leaving?

40:25.814 --> 40:28.077
I can't.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.515
Not until I find out
what's going on.

40:30.558 --> 40:32.038
I apologize.

40:32.081 --> 40:34.040
Why are you telling me this?

40:34.083 --> 40:36.738
Because you deserve to know.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.916
Thank you.

40:49.011 --> 40:51.013
Mm.

40:54.147 --> 40:56.715
Dennis just posted something.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.543
I'm still outside his apartment.

40:58.586 --> 41:00.109
DENNIS:
Hello, listeners.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.850
I have an interesting
new story.

41:01.894 --> 41:04.374
One the cops don't
want you to know about.

41:04.418 --> 41:05.985
A couple of bodies,

41:06.028 --> 41:08.291
and the NYPD is calling
our murderer

41:08.335 --> 41:10.250
the Sleeping Beauty killer.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.295
Why? Because he lovingly...Son of a bitch.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.907
...tucks his victims in
after brutally murdering them.

41:14.950 --> 41:18.432
And tonight,
I have a special guest...

41:18.476 --> 41:20.478
Is... is he doing this live?

41:20.521 --> 41:23.611
...the Sleeping Beauty killer
himself.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.221
Tell us your story.

41:25.265 --> 41:27.528
MAN [distorted voice]: Everyone
at some point in their life

41:27.572 --> 41:30.488
wants to kill someone,
but we never do.

41:30.531 --> 41:33.142
Why?
Because we're taught it's wrong

41:33.186 --> 41:35.101
and our world will end.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.538
DENNIS:
Well, it is wrong,

41:37.582 --> 41:40.802
and not everyone thinks
about killing someone.

41:40.846 --> 41:43.283
MAN:
But you have to ask yourself:

41:43.326 --> 41:45.807
What is it that defines
right and wrong?

41:45.851 --> 41:47.374
DENNIS:
So, then what happened?

41:49.115 --> 41:51.552
MAN:
Then one day, I did it.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.815
And I did it again.

41:53.859 --> 41:55.991
Did the world change
because three people died?

41:56.035 --> 41:57.297
Where is he?

41:57.340 --> 41:59.299
Did my world end?

41:59.342 --> 42:01.519
I thought you guys
were keeping this a secret.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.044
Not anymore.

42:05.087 --> 42:07.960
So much for controlling
the narrative.
