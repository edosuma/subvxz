00:57.266 --> 01:01.636
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:02.980 --> 01:05.471
<i>Where have you gone.</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:10.277
<i>Without me?</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:13.196
<i>I thought you cared.</i>

01:13.282 --> 01:18.368
<i>About me.</i>

01:18.453 --> 01:22.823
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:29.504
<i>Where's my heart?</i>

01:31.008 --> 01:33.876
<i>Where is the dream.</i>

01:33.969 --> 01:35.710
<i>We started?</i>

01:35.804 --> 01:38.091
Here I have
your beef carpaccio.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.345
<i>I can't believe.</i>

01:41.435 --> 01:44.303
<i>We're parted.</i>

01:46.064 --> 01:51.526
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:52.863 --> 01:54.775
<i>When we said.</i>

01:54.865 --> 01:57.403
<i>Goodbye, love.</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:04.906
<i>What had we to gain?</i>

02:06.752 --> 02:09.289
<i>When I.</i>

02:09.378 --> 02:14.340
<i>Gave you my love.</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:19.512
<i>Was it all in vain?</i>

02:22.267 --> 02:27.808
<i>All life through.</i>

02:29.149 --> 02:31.857
<i>Must I go on.</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:35.778
<i>Pretending?</i>

02:35.864 --> 02:39.198
<i>Where is my happy ending?</i>

02:43.622 --> 02:49.163
<i>Where are you?</i>

02:50.796 --> 02:51.912
Hello?

02:52.005 --> 02:57.125
<i>Where are you?</i>

02:58.178 --> 03:01.888
<i>Where are you?</i>

03:02.891 --> 03:04.553
So, how was the job?

03:04.643 --> 03:06.537
It was fine, you know,
until I figure out...

03:06.561 --> 03:07.768
What to do with your life?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.265
No one ever does.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.642
Okay, what the hell is that?

03:15.570 --> 03:18.233
I found it on the train.
I'm just gonna drop it off tomorrow.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.718
Oh, you're gonna...
You're gonna drop it off tomorrow?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.734
- Are you insane?
- No, Erica.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.319
Where I come from,
that's what we do.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.654
Okay, this is Manhattan.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.239
You find a bag,
you call bomb squad.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.159
Don't open that.

03:35.132 --> 03:39.593
Gross. A lottery ticket,
weird-looking pills.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.886
"Greta Hideg."

03:43.390 --> 03:44.506
Let's see.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.682
- No. Uh-huh.
- Oh, here we go.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.726
Yes.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.061
A spa day.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.266
Or we could
do a colonic.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.767
Come on, it'll be fun.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.603
- Will it be?
- Yeah.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.396
They jet asparagus juice
up your ass.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.176
And it's not just
about cleansing your body,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.283
it's also very good
for short-term memory.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.985
- Really?
- Hmm-mmm.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.196
Jason Largo was dyslexic,

04:08.290 --> 04:09.434
and since
he's been doing them,

04:09.458 --> 04:11.950
now he can say
the alphabet backwards.

04:12.711 --> 04:16.625
Look, we're not taking
her money, number one,

04:16.714 --> 04:18.456
and number two,
I don't want asparagus juice

04:18.550 --> 04:20.507
shot up my butt
under any circumstance.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.506
Never say never.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.095
Have you called
your dad yet?

04:26.683 --> 04:27.683
Ugh.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.013
Do I have to?

04:31.855 --> 04:32.915
Just don't
want him to think

04:32.939 --> 04:34.475
I'm not giving you
the messages.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.899
Yeah, I know.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.442
I'll call him.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.857
Hey.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.112
Come on.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.493
Movie hasn't even
started yet.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.615
I know. It's just...

04:54.294 --> 04:56.206
It was our thing, you know?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.874
Some crappy movie,

05:01.218 --> 05:03.335
just Mom and I.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.714
Come on, Frankie.
Let's get you home.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.346
You could always
give me your mom.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.268
Ah. Please, take her.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.521
Thank you.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.009
Who is this?

05:53.103 --> 05:55.846
Oh, uh, it's Frances McCullen.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.728
I have a bag that I found that I
think belongs to a Greta Hideg.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.768
Oh, uh, hi.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.735
Here you go.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.990
Oh, bless your heart.
I've been looking everywhere.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.787
- Where did you find it?
- Uh, on the subway.

06:13.874 --> 06:17.038
Oh, darling, you brought it
all the way in this rain.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.787
Will you like a cup of coffee?
It's already on the pot.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.547
It would mean a lot to me.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.499
You've been so kind.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.258
Yeah, sure. Why not?

06:29.389 --> 06:33.178
- You can put your umbrella here.
- Okay. Thank you.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.891
Are you from New York?

06:37.981 --> 06:40.724
No, I'm actually
from Boston,

06:40.817 --> 06:42.729
but I'm living here
with a friend.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.449
Thank you.

06:52.704 --> 06:53.911
Boyfriend?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.954
No, my roommate
from Smith.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.580
Her dad bought her a loft
in Tribeca for graduation,

06:59.669 --> 07:01.581
- so we're breaking it in.
- Oh.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.045
That must be tough.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.052
The neighbors. I'm sorry.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.845
Remodeling.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.798
A little courtesy, please!

07:13.892 --> 07:16.100
A little quiet!

07:16.186 --> 07:17.552
Thank you!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.932
I swear they are building an ark.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.824
- Is this your husband?
- Yes.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.776
Christof.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.487
- When he was young.
- Hmm.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.739
And is that your daughter?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.501
Yes. Nicola.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.932
He taught me how to play.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.384
My husband.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.562
Liszt was his favorite.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.573
Then he began
fluffing the notes.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.528
His left hand.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.251
He thought
it was arthritis.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.877
Six months later,
he was gone.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.883
They are with you,
and then they are gone.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.589
The ones we love.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.385
"Liebestraum." Do you know
what it means?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.815
A dream of love.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.025
Because that's all
love leaves us with.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.283
A dream. A memory.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.835
I'm sorry.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.254
It's my only company
these days.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.875
Is that your dog?

09:13.136 --> 09:15.844
Oh, yes. Jojo.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.967
Long gone as well.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.550
Well, have you considered
getting another?

09:20.643 --> 09:23.306
Oh, no, I couldn't.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.137
I wouldn't know
how to choose.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.726
Well, I could help you.
If you wanted.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.732
- Are you a dog person?
- A little bit.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.064
My mom actually
used to breed them.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.487
Thank you, sweetheart, but I don't think
I could manage a dog right now.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.248
I hope you are not offended.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.825
Not at all.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.170
But if you change your mind,
just let me know.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.465
- Do I have your phone number?
- No.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.058
I never know
how to work these things.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.858
Here, let me help you.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.537
It was actually
a really spiritual experience.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.831
They cleanse your soul,
not just your butt,

10:25.917 --> 10:29.331
to the sound of shamanic
singing bowls and pan flutes.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.911
Please be kidding.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.588
- You should come with me next time.
- Nope.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.462
- I ordered takeout.
- Wait.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.885
- While they were up your...
- No, God!

10:37.971 --> 10:39.803
Gross. For now, for dinner.

10:39.931 --> 10:40.931
Oh.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.009
Thank God.
I'm starving.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.642
Yeah, apartment 4B.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.317
Uh, Greta?

10:53.653 --> 10:54.814
Oh.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.656
- Hey.
<i>- Sorry to bother you, sweetheart.</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:01.449
<i>Am I calling
at a bad time?</i>

11:01.536 --> 11:04.700
No, no, not at all.
How are you?

11:04.789 --> 11:08.874
<i>I've been thinking about
what you said about the dog,</i>

11:09.627 --> 11:13.917
and I thought,
if you wouldn't mind coming, it...

11:14.007 --> 11:16.624
It might not be
such a bad idea after all.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.755
Yeah, of course.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.837
When... When do you
want to go?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.387
<i>Saturday morning?</i>

11:22.473 --> 11:24.385
<i>Is 10:00 too early?</i>

11:24.475 --> 11:26.888
No, 10:00's fine.
I'll see you then.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.645
Did I just snort crystal meth,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.816
or did you just offer to go
dog shopping with an old lady?

11:33.902 --> 11:34.983
I know.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.107
This city is gonna
eat you alive.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.191
So, how long
do you keep them here?

11:42.285 --> 11:44.322
- Five days.
- And then?

11:44.412 --> 11:48.201
If nobody claims
their dogs, they're PTS.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.034
- PTS?
- Put to sleep.

11:51.628 --> 11:54.245
Oh,
what a dreadful euphemism.

11:55.673 --> 12:00.793
And so, which of these
is next for the PTS treatment?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.420
Uh...

12:05.099 --> 12:07.056
This is Morton.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.554
Today is Morton's last day.

12:09.771 --> 12:10.771
Oh.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.156
- May I come in?
- Hmm-mmm.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.527
Come on.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.660
Come on, Morton.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.959
You don't want to end up
a euphemism, do you?

12:35.672 --> 12:37.163
Morton,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.793
I'm taking you home.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.926
<i>Smile.</i>

12:52.897 --> 12:53.978
Great.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.562
Oh, goodness.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.151
I had no idea
it could do this.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.481
I know. The wonders
of technology, huh?

13:04.367 --> 13:08.236
Oh, um, if you want to send it to your
daughter, it's actually pretty easy.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.821
You just click this,
and then share.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.915
Oh.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.784
You're close to your mother,
I can tell.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.331
Hmm.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.543
She actually passed away.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.759
Last year.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.295
Oh, Frances.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.714
Yeah.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.800
Why didn't you tell me?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.344
It's like you said.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.186
I'm left with this...

13:38.276 --> 13:39.938
This dream of her,

13:42.071 --> 13:43.903
and I don't want her
to fade.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.482
It won't.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.820
If you keep it here.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.164
In your heart.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.688
It's okay
to light a candle,

15:00.775 --> 15:02.687
even if you don't really

15:03.903 --> 15:05.360
practice.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.772
I'm sure it is.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.490
Christof used to play
the organ here.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.822
Every Friday.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.246
Today's a Friday.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.290
I know.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.091
For the ones that are gone.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.054
Yes?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.228
Nothing has changed.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.272
Still the same racket
from the window.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.599
Listen.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.481
Love you, too.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.317
Ciao.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.414
- Nicola, she used to go here.
- Mmm.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.082
The youngest-ever winner
of the Little Mozart.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.667
And where is she now?

16:03.546 --> 16:04.912
Paris.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.210
I would have loved
Juilliard for her.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.133
Still, the Conservatoire
de Paris is not to be...

16:13.222 --> 16:15.214
How do you say that?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.424
Sneezed at?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.723
You must miss her terribly.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.142
Oh, I get by.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.019
One way or another.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.316
You don't have
to be lonely.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.947
Oh, my dear.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.694
Even you'll be gone soon.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.616
You know,
my friends say, uh...

16:43.586 --> 16:44.793
I'm like chewing gum.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.497
Chewing gum?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.999
I tend to stick around.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.965
You promise?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.589
I promise.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.896
So, remember Simon Porter?

17:04.982 --> 17:06.143
Uh...

17:08.319 --> 17:09.319
Um...

17:09.403 --> 17:11.611
Chin fuzz, sideburns,

17:11.696 --> 17:14.030
dad works at
<i>The New York Times?</i>

17:14.742 --> 17:16.529
No, absolutely no clue.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.234
Okay, well, he remembers you.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.616
He's having a party tonight,
and we're going.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.914
I am wearing these.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.785
- What, are they bad?
- No, they're great.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.791
They're disgusting.
You want to puke.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.123
Erica, they're perfect, okay?
I just can't go.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.051
I already made plans
with Greta to have dinner.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.927
Seriously?

17:36.013 --> 17:38.721
You'd rather have dinner
with Cruella than your friends?

17:38.808 --> 17:41.095
That's mean.
And they're not my friends.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.892
Hey. I am.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.347
Well, I'm sorry, but I made
these plans last week, so...

17:46.440 --> 17:48.397
Come on. Please.
I'll call her.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.984
- Do you want me to call her?
- Erica, I can't go.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.484
I have to be there in, like,
30 minutes, so no.

17:56.826 --> 17:57.862
What?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.527
What?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.614
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but this is just...

18:03.708 --> 18:05.415
It's getting weird.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.456
You, like, totally
adopted this woman.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.796
She's my friend.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.962
You hardly know her.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.343
Okay, I'm gonna call her.
That's it.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.907
And we're putting her
on a serious taper,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.923
- starting tomorrow.
- No, Erica. What the hell?

18:21.017 --> 18:23.475
Why do you always think that you
can just tell me what to do?

18:23.561 --> 18:26.429
Right, I'm just
some superficial bitch.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.514
But I don't see how
making some random lady

18:28.608 --> 18:30.315
your surrogate mom
is normal.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.858
Excuse me?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.277
You're gonna pretend that that's
not what's going on here?

18:34.363 --> 18:36.525
It's so obvious, it's sad.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.364
She's not your mother.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.205
I'm gonna try and forget
that you just said that to me.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.002
Careful. It's hot.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.210
Mmm.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.385
That's delicious.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.088
<i>Soupe de poisson.</i>

19:03.976 --> 19:06.309
- And the risotto?
- Ah.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.141
Courgette and basil.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.268
Or so my mother told me.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.605
Mmm.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.607
- Is it good?
- Delicious. Hmm.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.211
Where are the candles?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.295
- In the cabinet, the little cabinet.
- Okay.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.678
Did you find them?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.020
Yeah, I found them.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.069
Mmm.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.692
Wonderful.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.739
I wish I had
met your mother.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.748
It's good, no?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.792
It's delicious.

20:56.380 --> 21:00.249
So, tell me
about your friend.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.211
This friend of yours...
Erica is her name, no?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.814
What's wrong?
You seem upset.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.608
I'm really not feeling well.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.277
Oh, dear.
Are you sick?

21:21.363 --> 21:22.363
Maybe.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.028
I don't know,
it just kind of came over me.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.706
Would you like to lay down?

21:34.752 --> 21:36.789
No, I think I should
just go home.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.584
We haven't had dessert.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.959
That's okay.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.050
I'll pack you a plate,
if you want.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.507
No, no, it's totally fine.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.096
- It's no bother.
- Greta, really, it's fine.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.976
Are you sure?
It will just take a moment.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.682
I'm sure.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.897
Is there anything
I can do?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.606
Tell me where it hurts.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.652
I just need to go home.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.663
Use the key.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.503
In the bowl.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.737
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.904
I mean, I guess she's been, what,
purposely planting them around the city?

22:53.998 --> 22:57.366
Just hoping someone
brings them back to her?

22:57.459 --> 23:00.668
- And you did.
- Yeah, I did.

23:02.464 --> 23:06.834
Ugh. That's the creepiest
thing I've ever heard.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.612
Here you go.
Table five. Hurry up.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.758
Hey, she's really
freaking me out.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.006
<i>Yeah, tell me about it.</i>

23:51.096 --> 23:53.839
- She called there, too?
<i>- Only, like, 80 times.</i>

23:53.933 --> 23:55.720
I had to unplug the phone.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.142
<i>Oh, my God,
I just want her to go away.</i>

23:58.228 --> 24:00.060
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it's not that easy,

24:00.522 --> 24:02.559
<i>especially if they
don't want to go.</i>

24:02.650 --> 24:04.437
<i>And do you want
to know the kicker?</i>

24:04.526 --> 24:05.892
What's the kicker?

24:05.986 --> 24:08.194
<i>The crazier they are,
the harder they cling.</i>

24:08.280 --> 24:09.396
Don't tell me that.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.277
Then I also won't tell you
that I tried

24:11.367 --> 24:13.279
- to warn you about her.
<i>- I know.</i>

24:13.786 --> 24:15.869
God damn it, why didn't I
just listen to you?

24:15.955 --> 24:18.288
<i>You never do.</i>

24:18.374 --> 24:20.582
Well, from now on,
I swear to God,

24:20.668 --> 24:22.330
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.035
There's somebody
asking for you.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.210
- Who?
- A woman.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.301
Oh, my God, Erica,
I think she's here.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.846
<i>- Shit.</i>
- I'll call you later.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.231
Can you get rid of her?

24:49.321 --> 24:52.234
I tried. She said
she needed to see you.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.234
I don't want to talk to her.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.535
- Look, Francine...
- It's Frances.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.954
I'm not your public relations
manager, understand?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.040
Just get rid of her.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.120
And I don't want a scene.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.386
Greta,
what are you doing here?

25:15.472 --> 25:18.180
I was worried.
You didn't answer your phone.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.601
- I left you some messages.
- I got them.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.428
- What do you want?
- Sweetheart, I...

25:23.522 --> 25:26.060
- Don't.
- What?

25:26.150 --> 25:28.016
Don't call me that.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.858
What's wrong?

25:35.325 --> 25:36.816
What is it?

25:36.910 --> 25:39.903
<i>- Ma chérie...</i>
- Stop calling me that.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.493
Tell me what's wrong.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.329
Come on, Greta.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.829
I saw them.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.926
The bags in the closet, Greta.
I saw them.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.054
What, you go...
You go planting them around,

25:58.140 --> 26:00.035
hoping some lost soul's gonna
bring them back to you?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.995
Trying to find the biggest
sucker in New York City?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.851
Well, congratulations.
You found her.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.473
- Frances.
- God, you're good.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.270
You're really, really good.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.271
You totally had me.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.978
Thank God I opened
the wrong closet door.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.736
- Will you let me explain?
- No, I won't let you explain.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.033
Because it's over.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.365
And I never want
to see you again.

26:21.455 --> 26:22.741
Frances, please.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.323
Do not come back here.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.592
<i>Frances?</i>

27:17.386 --> 27:19.719
<i>If you would only
let me explain.</i>

27:19.805 --> 27:23.298
<i>What I did was wrong.
I know that now.</i>

27:23.392 --> 27:26.260
<i>And it will
never happen again.</i>

27:26.353 --> 27:28.595
<i>But since Nicola left,</i>

27:28.689 --> 27:33.775
<i>I have been in this well of loneliness,
this black hole.</i>

27:33.861 --> 27:36.729
<i>Maybe it drove me
a little mad.</i>

27:38.073 --> 27:41.282
<i>We were meant
for love, Frances,</i>

27:41.368 --> 27:43.781
<i>not this terrible isolation.</i>

27:45.998 --> 27:50.538
<i>And if you don't call me,
I don't know what I will do.</i>

27:53.589 --> 27:55.171
Want to work Saturday,
6:00 to close?

27:55.257 --> 27:57.590
Uh... Yeah, sure.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.182
- Okay, go.
- Sorry.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.723
Go, go, go.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.643
If those are mine,
I'm gonna dry-hump you right here.

28:12.733 --> 28:13.974
I wish.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.522
Frances McCullen?

28:27.206 --> 28:28.788
I can't accept those.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.412
White lilies.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.919
I'm sorry.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.302
Uh...

28:47.392 --> 28:50.681
I'm so sorry.
Um, did any of it get on you?

28:52.648 --> 28:55.641
I will get you a new glass immediately.
I'm very, very, very sorry.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.149
Um, I'll be right back
with your other glass.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.663
Call the cops.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.671
This is not a problem?

29:23.345 --> 29:25.507
So she can just stand there
and stare at me all day,

29:25.597 --> 29:27.930
and that's not a problem?
Everything's cool?

29:28.684 --> 29:32.303
Across the street?
Yeah, pretty much.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.807
How is that not harassment?

29:33.897 --> 29:37.231
Ma'am, technically, she can stand there
with a telephoto lens and a tripod

29:37.317 --> 29:39.104
and take your picture
if she wants to.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.396
Public area,
her rights are protected.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.190
Awesome.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.992
Ignore her.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.945
She's just looking
for attention.

29:51.039 --> 29:54.373
The more you give her,
the more she'll want back.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.877
- Well, that was easy.
- Ma'am.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.333
I said I was sorry.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.789
Please talk to me!

31:20.879 --> 31:23.292
I said I was sorry.
Just tell me what you want...

32:05.340 --> 32:08.378
- Please.
- Jesus! What...

32:08.468 --> 32:11.461
God, what do you...
What do you want from me?

32:11.555 --> 32:13.046
I want to talk.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.348
Then talk to your daughter.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.472
I can't.
She does not understand.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.182
What?

32:20.355 --> 32:24.019
- What doesn't she understand?
- I'm lonely.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.192
Greta, everybody's lonely.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.520
That does not mean that you
get to follow people around

32:28.613 --> 32:30.275
and terrorize them.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.607
Everybody needs a friend.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.984
- You have your Erica.
- No.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.741
No, you leave Erica
out of this.

32:42.794 --> 32:46.162
You said you always
stick around like chewing gum.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.093
Are you insane?

32:52.179 --> 32:53.590
Please.

32:54.181 --> 32:57.049
Let's try and start again.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.429
I love you.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.556
You don't even know me.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.858
I tried to talk to you.
I tried.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.771
But you wouldn't listen.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.743
People can't keep
doing this to me.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.837
Ugh, I can't believe
she did this.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.158
<i>Harassment restraining
order can be applied for</i>

33:37.182 --> 33:39.674
<i>in certain circumstances.</i>

33:39.768 --> 33:42.932
- Is there any physical assault?
- She threw gum in her hair.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.352
Chewing gum?

33:44.439 --> 33:46.021
A restraining order.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.314
How could I apply for one?

33:47.400 --> 33:50.484
You file a petitioner's affidavit
before the court administrator.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.813
Once the filing fee is paid,
it's forwarded to the judge for review.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.739
The judge may then
schedule a hearing.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.303
And how long
could that take?

33:57.327 --> 34:00.035
It's Manhattan.
The courts are overcrowded.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.535
- How long?
- It could take months.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.662
Instructions for filing
are online.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.386
In order to remove
a dog from the home,

34:18.473 --> 34:20.760
SPCA would need
proof of mistreatment,

34:20.850 --> 34:24.014
like photos
or witness statements.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.389
What if I don't
have any proof,

34:25.480 --> 34:28.973
but I'm worried
about the dog's safety?

34:29.067 --> 34:32.811
You talking about that sweet French lady
that you came here with?

34:33.737 --> 34:35.070
I'm just frightened.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.114
<i>For the dog.</i>

35:41.473 --> 35:43.635
I thought you were in Paris.

35:45.018 --> 35:48.138
<i>The customer you have
called is unavailable to take your call.</i>

35:48.188 --> 35:50.771
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

35:50.857 --> 35:52.018
<i>Hi. This is Frances McCullen.</i>

35:52.108 --> 35:55.317
<i>I'm trying to get in contact
with Nicola Hideg,</i>

35:56.112 --> 35:58.274
<i>Greta Hideg's daughter.</i>

35:58.365 --> 36:02.530
<i>You see, I helped her
adopt a dog, and I'm worried.</i>

36:51.292 --> 36:52.453
Erica?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.517
God.

37:25.827 --> 37:29.161
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, where are you?</i>

37:29.247 --> 37:31.910
- Where should I be?
<i>- Chester's.</i>

37:33.334 --> 37:36.623
Oh, crap. I totally flaked.
I'm sorry.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.377
- We're still here. Come hang out.
<i>- No, it's okay.</i>

37:40.467 --> 37:43.130
I'm gonna stay in tonight.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.586
Are you okay?

37:46.347 --> 37:47.383
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

37:47.474 --> 37:49.887
Just, um... I'm tired.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.139
But I'll see you
when you get back.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.471
Okay. Bye.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.600
Hey, Papa.

38:36.689 --> 38:39.272
<i>- You haven't called me that in a while.</i>
- Uh...

38:40.610 --> 38:43.694
Sorry. It, uh...
It slipped.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.612
Maybe I should quit
while I'm ahead.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.361
<i>Maybe you should.</i>

38:48.451 --> 38:50.033
How are you doing?

38:50.119 --> 38:52.406
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:54.499 --> 38:57.992
Been thinking about
maybe going away.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.499
Might be good
to think some things over.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.250
<i>Can I come, too?</i>

39:04.175 --> 39:05.175
Just you and me?

39:05.969 --> 39:08.837
You're just mad at me
because I found a way to move on.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.637
Is that what it's called?

39:10.723 --> 39:12.214
<i>Did it ever occur to you</i>

39:12.308 --> 39:14.846
that your mom might have
wanted it that way?

39:14.936 --> 39:16.143
<i>Come on.</i>

39:16.229 --> 39:17.765
I mean, for both of us.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.348
<i>So that we could just
get on with our lives.</i>

39:20.441 --> 39:21.752
Is that supposed
to make this better?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.187
I'm not a perfect man.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.029
Which is fine, except now
you're quoting Bill Clinton, so...

39:27.156 --> 39:30.490
<i>Look, we've both been through so much.</i>

39:30.577 --> 39:32.318
<i>This hasn't been easy
on either of us.</i>

39:32.412 --> 39:35.155
<i>And I miss her
as much as you do.</i>

39:35.248 --> 39:36.329
<i>Frances?</i>

39:37.375 --> 39:38.495
Dad, I got to call you back.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.747
<i>Right now?</i>
Yeah. I'm sorry.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.600
<i>Frankie?</i>
Erica, Jesus Christ.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.808
What's the matter?
<i>Greta. She's there.</i>

40:03.902 --> 40:05.359
<i>She's sending me
pictures of you.</i>

40:05.445 --> 40:07.277
What?

40:07.363 --> 40:08.524
You got to get out of there.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.735
Actually, no, no. Don't go alone.
Is anybody with you?

40:10.783 --> 40:13.491
I've looked around.
Nobody's here.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.240
- Where are you?
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

40:15.330 --> 40:17.868
I'm leaving.
It was a bore fest anyways.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.770
Oh, my God, Erica. No, no, no.
She's still following you.

40:21.794 --> 40:24.036
She's literally going
out the door right now.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.917
<i>She can't be.
I slipped out the back.</i>

40:26.799 --> 40:29.382
<i>- Are you sure?</i>
- Yes, I'm sure.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.677
Take a deep breath.
Relax, okay?

40:33.181 --> 40:34.717
God, this is such bullshit.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.328
<i>I mean, she can't do this.
I'm gonna go to the cops tomorrow,</i>

40:37.352 --> 40:39.969
<i>- and I'm gonna hire an attorney.</i>
- Go, Frankie Mac.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.791
I mean, it's one thing to harass me,
but to threaten my friend, she can...

40:43.900 --> 40:44.900
<i>You there?</i>

40:44.984 --> 40:46.691
She's still following you.
Turn around.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.318
- I don't see anyone.
- You're...

40:51.407 --> 40:53.069
You're in an alleyway,
and there's some

40:53.159 --> 40:55.492
big billboard behind you,
and you're still on the phone.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.114
That's right in front of me.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.536
Jesus Christ.
You have to get out of there.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.788
<i>Erica?</i>

41:04.963 --> 41:06.704
Hello?

41:06.798 --> 41:09.336
Okay, calm down, Frankie.
I've gotten out of there.

41:09.926 --> 41:10.926
Where are you?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.134
I'm taking the goddamn subway.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.214
She's right behind you.
Turn around.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.848
She can't be.

41:21.688 --> 41:22.849
You bitch.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.851
<i>She's still following you.</i>

41:25.525 --> 41:26.857
I don't see her.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.105
I'm just gonna
take an Uber, okay?

41:32.991 --> 41:34.323
<i>A bus just pulled up.</i>

41:34.409 --> 41:35.970
<i>I can't believe myself,
but I'm getting on.</i>

41:35.994 --> 41:37.075
Go. Run.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.321
- Erica?
<i>- I'm on.</i>

41:41.290 --> 41:43.748
<i>- Watch for her.</i>
- I will.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.165
Okay, we're good.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.548
Erica, she's on the bus.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.337
What?

41:58.975 --> 42:00.932
- You need help.
<i>- Erica, don't talk to her!</i>

42:01.019 --> 42:03.181
You're pathetic!
Excuse me, I have to get off.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.807
Erica, get off the bus.

42:04.897 --> 42:08.061
- Okay, I'm off.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

42:08.151 --> 42:10.518
Uh, I don't know.
Somewhere on 33rd.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.572
There's a bar up ahead,
the Copper House.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.193
Copper House.
It's a left on 33rd from here.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.448
And hurry, please.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.463
You sick bitch.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.211
Oh, my God!

42:38.514 --> 42:39.755
Erica!

42:42.769 --> 42:43.769
Erica.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.264
Oh, my God. Hi.

42:50.359 --> 42:53.022
This chick
is seriously disturbed.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.344
I do have to admit, though,
she takes a good photo.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.325
I mean, I look badass.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.153
Erica, come on.

43:13.966 --> 43:15.332
Hello?

43:15.676 --> 43:16.962
<i>Hi.</i>

43:17.595 --> 43:23.011
<i>Um, this isn't gonna be easy,
but maybe we should meet.</i>

43:36.989 --> 43:38.525
Sorry.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.163
Frances?

43:52.421 --> 43:53.502
Um...

43:54.841 --> 43:55.841
Yeah.

43:58.094 --> 44:00.928
You called me about Nicola?

44:02.974 --> 44:06.433
I'm Alexa. Alexa Hammond.

44:07.645 --> 44:08.761
Do you want to...

44:15.361 --> 44:17.444
Nicola Hideg is dead.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.275
She killed herself
four years ago.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.165
I knew her from A.A.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.868
I was her addiction counselor,

44:32.962 --> 44:35.921
and then her partner
for six years.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.795
- But, uh, I can never...
- Um...

44:38.885 --> 44:41.844
I'm sorry, but...

44:42.680 --> 44:44.546
What about Paris?

44:46.058 --> 44:48.220
- Paris?
- Yeah.

44:48.728 --> 44:52.438
Greta said that she studied
at the conservatory there.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.933
Nicola had never been
to France.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.089
Listen, that whole
French shtick of Greta's

44:59.113 --> 45:01.196
is an affectation, all right?

45:01.282 --> 45:03.319
She's from Hungary.

45:06.412 --> 45:07.994
You know, Greta...

45:09.707 --> 45:12.950
She still pretends
to talk to her.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.706
On the phone.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.788
She's a very ill woman.

45:17.882 --> 45:22.422
So, Nicola never studied
the piano or anything?

45:23.179 --> 45:26.138
She used to play
till her knuckles bled.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.220
You can't save people.

45:29.310 --> 45:35.648
You know, I couldn't save her from whatever
it was that had been done to her.

45:37.318 --> 45:40.356
You know, maybe she just
couldn't survive the box.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.778
The box?

45:43.741 --> 45:45.778
I used to think
it was a metaphor.

45:46.369 --> 45:49.077
You know, the box
in which she was confined

45:49.163 --> 45:52.201
as a child or whatever.

45:53.626 --> 45:57.495
But I came to realize
before the end

45:59.632 --> 46:01.544
that maybe I was wrong.

46:03.803 --> 46:06.967
<i>- I was speaking with Erica.</i>
- Dad.

46:07.056 --> 46:09.013
<i>She told me
what's been going on.</i>

46:09.100 --> 46:11.137
You keep telling me
everything is okay.

46:11.227 --> 46:13.264
<i>I am okay. I...</i>

46:13.980 --> 46:15.642
I'm an adult.

46:15.731 --> 46:17.688
So talk to me
like I'm an adult.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.937
<i>Okay, like an adult.</i>

46:20.528 --> 46:25.774
This woman is unstable.
You need to cut her off entirely.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.402
I already have cut her off.

46:32.123 --> 46:33.864
Look, Dad,
I'll call you back later.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.839
Hi. I'm Frances, and I'll be
your waitress for the evening.

46:47.513 --> 46:51.723
A Kir Royale and some
sparkling water, <i>ma chérie.</i>

46:53.227 --> 46:55.685
No, I... I'm sorry. I can't do this.

46:55.771 --> 46:57.057
But I've reserved, my dear.

46:57.273 --> 46:59.606
- What do you mean, you can't?
- Is there a problem?

46:59.692 --> 47:02.560
Yes, this woman has been harassing me.
You need to ask her to leave.

47:02.653 --> 47:03.939
I'm afraid
she has a reservation.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.942
What kind of service is this?

47:06.032 --> 47:07.398
How can I help you, madam?

47:07.491 --> 47:09.699
A Kir Royale
and a sparkling water.

47:09.785 --> 47:10.866
She has my order.

47:13.205 --> 47:15.367
- Want some Valium with that?
- Yeah. Wouldn't work.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.207
- Is she your stalker?
- Yeah.

47:19.462 --> 47:20.578
Good luck.

47:34.310 --> 47:37.599
I'll start with the crab bisque
and a small green salad.

47:37.688 --> 47:41.272
- Why are you doing this?
- Because we have to talk.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.146
I have nothing to say to you.

47:43.235 --> 47:46.694
Nothing? After all
we've been through together?

47:47.865 --> 47:49.731
And the sea bream to follow.

47:49.825 --> 47:52.363
- It's palatable?
- It's excellent.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.661
A glass of something
white and dry.

47:56.457 --> 47:57.664
The pinot grigio.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.662
No. Something French.

48:00.086 --> 48:01.293
The Chablis.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.961
If you say so.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.755
<i>Chérie.</i>

48:05.841 --> 48:08.424
- Do not call me that.
<i>- Et pourquoi pas?</i>

48:08.511 --> 48:11.219
It's what you are.
My darling. <i>Ma chérie.</i>

48:11.305 --> 48:13.092
Why are you speaking French?

48:23.609 --> 48:26.727
- Was she talking Klingon?
- Call the cops.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.734
- Henri won't like that.
- I don't care. Just call them.

48:29.824 --> 48:31.281
Your funeral.

48:50.553 --> 48:51.553
The Chablis.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.545
May I?

48:56.517 --> 48:57.633
Hmm...

48:59.186 --> 49:02.224
A bit like you.
Promises a lot, then disappoints.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.766
- Okay.
- I deserve better!

49:08.779 --> 49:10.441
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

49:10.573 --> 49:12.530
You can't do this to me.
To us.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.699
- Are you a child?
- No, you're the child.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.118
You need someone to love.
You need a mother to hold you.

49:17.204 --> 49:18.924
You lost someone,
and you're afraid to love.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.475
- We both know it's true.
- Don't you dare

49:20.499 --> 49:21.579
talk to me about my mother.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.082
Darling, don't you understand?

49:23.169 --> 49:24.501
She had to die.

49:24.587 --> 49:26.078
She had to die
for us to meet!

49:26.172 --> 49:27.288
Are you out of your mind?

49:27.381 --> 49:28.747
You just can't accept it!

49:28.841 --> 49:31.424
Look at her!
She's full of loss! Of grieving!

49:31.510 --> 49:33.126
She's gone, Frances!

49:33.220 --> 49:36.133
Just accept it!
It's called moving on!

49:38.767 --> 49:40.724
Leave me alone! She's gone!

49:40.811 --> 49:43.645
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

49:48.152 --> 49:50.269
Leave me alone!

50:05.377 --> 50:07.414
I should just try
and ignore her, right?

50:23.062 --> 50:24.849
And how am I supposed
to take precautions

50:24.939 --> 50:28.603
when you're not even gonna tell me
whether or not she's been released?

50:30.444 --> 50:32.356
Oh, my God.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.813
You already released her,
didn't you?

50:36.200 --> 50:39.238
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.069
God damn it.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.826
My dad wants
to come pick me up.

50:50.464 --> 50:51.955
Okay.

50:54.009 --> 50:55.591
Okay?

50:57.888 --> 50:59.174
I think you should go.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.674
What, just leave?

51:05.187 --> 51:09.397
Come away with me, then,
if the family thing's too much.

51:10.276 --> 51:12.563
We can go to Baja. It's cheap.

51:14.071 --> 51:18.361
Yeah, but she'd still be here
the minute we got back.

51:23.372 --> 51:27.161
Well, then, guess you'll have
to try the slow fade.

51:27.793 --> 51:29.329
What's that?

51:29.420 --> 51:30.911
You apologize,

51:31.005 --> 51:33.622
tell her the problem
is you, not her,

51:33.716 --> 51:36.754
and that you have to go
and deal with your, um, issues.

51:37.386 --> 51:40.754
By the time that you're back,
she'll have moved on to someone else.

51:42.349 --> 51:43.590
So,

51:44.184 --> 51:47.143
lie, in other words?

51:48.897 --> 51:50.729
Right to her face.

51:50.816 --> 51:54.435
I'll take you through it.
I'm the master of the slow fade.

52:30.773 --> 52:32.514
It's Friday.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.442
Greta, I'm sorry.

52:40.532 --> 52:44.071
I know you are, dear.

52:47.247 --> 52:49.079
You were right.

52:51.543 --> 52:52.750
I do care.

52:56.465 --> 52:58.878
I've just been so upset
about my mom,

52:58.967 --> 53:01.926
and I was blaming you.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.523
I'm gonna go away tomorrow.

53:17.319 --> 53:19.060
Just for a little bit.

53:19.738 --> 53:22.025
Think some things over.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.094
You've been such a help.

53:47.850 --> 53:50.263
A friend when I needed one
the most.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.809
Everyone needs a friend.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.107
But we're more
than friends, Frances.

53:58.193 --> 54:00.059
We're connected.

54:00.154 --> 54:02.111
We're family.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.029
I know.

54:05.617 --> 54:09.281
And what does
every child need?

54:15.210 --> 54:16.997
A mother.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.012
So we'll meet
when you come back?

54:29.057 --> 54:32.516
- You need packing help?
- No.

54:36.982 --> 54:39.565
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

54:41.278 --> 54:42.985
No.

54:51.955 --> 54:54.538
So it's not goodbye, darling.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.247
Don't I deserve a hug?

55:42.297 --> 55:45.131
Maybe that was
goodbye, Morton.

55:50.013 --> 55:53.222
<i>You showed up with a black eye.</i>

55:53.308 --> 55:56.221
<i>Looking to go start a fight.</i>

55:56.311 --> 55:59.475
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

55:59.565 --> 56:03.479
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

56:03.569 --> 56:06.858
<i>Playboys under your mattress.</i>

56:06.947 --> 56:09.860
<i>Like I wouldn't notice.</i>

56:09.950 --> 56:13.239
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

56:13.328 --> 56:17.288
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

56:28.677 --> 56:31.135
<i>What do I share?</i>

56:31.221 --> 56:33.838
<i>What do I keep.</i>

56:33.932 --> 56:36.015
<i>From all the strangers.</i>

56:36.101 --> 56:40.971
<i>Who sleep where I sleep?</i>

57:08.258 --> 57:09.590
Erica?

57:22.606 --> 57:24.893
Erica, did you
water the plants?

58:08.568 --> 58:12.403
Erica isn't here, dear,
but thank goodness,

58:13.198 --> 58:14.860
I am.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.693
It seems you forgot to pack.

58:20.247 --> 58:24.582
Now, which shoes
would you like to bring?

58:26.586 --> 58:29.579
Sir, can you help me?

58:29.673 --> 58:31.335
- My niece, she's very ill.
- Sure.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.257
Sure. I'll grab her.

58:42.060 --> 58:43.517
Thank you.

58:48.358 --> 58:51.396
I'm going to put you
right to bed when we get home.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.138
Here we are.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:14.317
Toys for you to play with.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.190
Even if you don't
deserve them.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.864
Telling me one big lie
like that.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:26.746
But we'll have
our little holiday here.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.493
Hmm?

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.180
<i>You showed up with a black eye.</i>

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:47.350
<i>Looking to go start a fight.</i>

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:50.599
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:54.399
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.727
<i>Playboys under your mattress.</i>

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:01.030
<i>Like I wouldn't notice.</i>

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:04.234
<i>Paint the black hole blacker.</i>

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:08.321
<i>Paint the black hole blacker</i>

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.089
Erica?

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.674
Shouldn't you be packing?

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:29.262
Yeah.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.641
Yeah, right.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.075
Daddy's here.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.118
Is he afraid to come up?

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.995
I don't know. Maybe.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.292
Kind of been on his case
a lot lately.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.791
Give him a chance.
He loves you.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.793
Oh! I'm gonna miss you.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:04.380
You okay?

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.421
I don't know.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:11.972
I love you,
but you got to go.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.984
- Call me.
- I will.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:23.438
- Send pictures, okay?
- Okay.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.354
What the hell?

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.152
Oh, my God!

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.700
Help! Oh, my God!

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.406
No! No, no!

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:13.738
Oh, my God. Help!

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.869
Please. Oh, my God!

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.621
No! No!

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.794
Help me!

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.556
What?

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.626
Help me! Please.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.204
No! Please let me out!

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:05.381
Please let me go. No, no.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.675
No! Please, somebody help me!

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:13.139
This is the bed of lies.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.883
You were not even packed.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:19.933
- You were not going anywhere, were you?
- Please.

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:23.524
- Just trying to get rid of Greta.
- Please.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.630
Please don't close it.
Don't close it.

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:29.317
Don't close it. Don't close it.
Please don't close it.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.320
You want out?
Come on, then.

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:36.487
Just like Nicola.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.495
Can't make up your mind.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:47.443
Please.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:03.954
God, let me out! Let me out!

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.659
No.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.632
What?

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.507
What did you do to her?

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:05.386
Where is she?

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:22.239
Please.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.117
Please.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.287
Frances?

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.631
I've been going through
some old photos.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:42.260
You remember that place
we rented in Martha's Vineyard?

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.267
God, I hate voicemails.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:50.264
Just call me, will you?

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.703
<i>Salt sticks to your skin...</i>

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.915
Oh! How sweet.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.827
<i>Curse these days gone by</i>

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.331
<i>I want to try it all again</i>

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.379
5.63 meters. Displacement...

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.582
<i>Bless our foolish hearts.</i>

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.917
<i>How could we know?</i>

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.002
<i>How could we have known?</i>

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.048
- I got three X's.
- What was that?

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.179
My daughter,

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.727
she's on vacation
with a friend.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:31.430
<i>In this quiet place</i>

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.312
<i>I'm hiding.</i>

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:37.314
<i>In your warm embrace</i>

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:40.193
<i>I'm lost.</i>

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.196
<i>In this quiet place</i>

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.698
<i>I'm hiding.</i>

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:49.077
<i>In your warm embrace.</i>

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.707
<i>Never-ending blue...</i>

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:55.207
<i>Frances, thanks for that text.</i>

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.381
<i>It meant so much to me.</i>

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:01.881
<i>Like some kind
of horrible cloud had lifted.</i>

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.009
<i>When you come back,
let's sit down and talk.</i>

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:07.386
<i>We've both been through a lot,</i>

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.471
<i>but I won't lose you.</i>

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:12.054
<i>I hear the seabirds
sing their song</i>

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.731
<i>I'm lost.</i>

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.810
<i>In this quiet place</i>

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:20.442
<i>I'm hiding.</i>

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:22.272
<i>In your warm embrace</i>

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.402
<i>I'm lost.</i>

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:27.496
<i>In this quiet place...</i>

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.327
<i>Frances,
I'm coming into the city.</i>

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.749
<i>You must be back by now.</i>

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.246
<i>Call me back.</i>

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.130
Yeah, I'll buzz you in.

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:57.641
Are you ready for your lesson?

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:04.735
So you're back?

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.387
- From where?
- From wherever it is you went.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.323
Is she inside?

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:10.075
No, she went on vacation
with you.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:11.575
No, with you.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.881
Don't cry, <i>angyalom.</i>

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:33.769
We all make mistakes
now and then.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.726
Come on.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.577
Good. One more time.

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.830
No.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.163
C. Pinkie on the C.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.998
<i>Kisujj</i>. Go ahead.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.883
There was
a nurse, Hideg,

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:12.762
dismissed from Bellevue Hospital
for misuse of anesthetics.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.935
No criminal record.
Could it be her?

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.387
I never met the woman.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.768
She reportedly
returned to Hungary.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.770
Left no forwarding address.

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:22.486
The files show...

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:25.901
Just find her, Mr. Cody,
whatever it costs.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.775
250 a day, plus expenses.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.215
Drink up, now.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:51.880
Please, <i>angyalom.</i>

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.597
We don't want
the box again, do we?

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:17.990
<i>You needed that to sleep.</i>

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.189
<i>"Mézeskalács."</i>

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.565
Repeat after me,
<i>"Mézeskalács."</i>

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.779
<i>- "Mézeskalács."</i>
- No.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.983
<i>"Mézeskalács."</i>

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:55.444
You have to be longer
on the... On <i>"mézeskalács."</i>

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.450
<i>"Mézeskalács."</i>

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.499
One more time.<i>"Mézeskalács."</i>

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:02.167
<i>"Mézeskalács."</i>

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.119
Good. You're learning.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:06.834
You probably
call them cookies.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:11.176
Although...
Although the honey in the dough

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.549
can make it, how...
How do you say?

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:16.348
Um... <i>Ragados.</i>

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.597
I bet that means "sticky."

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:25.065
My <i>kisujj!</i>

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:26.376
No. Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.808
Oh, my God.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.230
Samantha?

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:57.066
I could use some, too, my darling, but you first.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.083
A lady is known

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:52.246
by her shoes and her gloves.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:56.417
And we are nothing
if not ladies.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:06.969
She's still alive.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.431
Forget about her, <i>angyalom.</i>

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:14.188
She's in Heaven now.

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.019
You are the only one.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.166
What a pair we are. Hmm?

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.286
But we can do better.

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:36.957
Can't we?

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.047
My darling.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:59.164
Can I help you?

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.341
I'm looking for
a Greta Hideg.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.301
And?

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:05.504
I was told she lives here.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:07.055
She does.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.140
If you can call it living.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.311
Sorry.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:16.765
- Was meant to be amusing.
- It was amusing.

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:20.186
Are you a roofer?
A chimney sweep?

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.236
I'm looking for
any information...

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.189
Don't tell me
you're from the IRS.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.320
...on Frances McCullen.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:28.492
Do you know her?

01:18:30.748 --> 01:18:32.205
Yes.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:33.953
Yes, I know her.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.580
I haven't seen her
in a while.

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:40.960
Well, I'm a family friend,
and they haven't heard from her, either.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.461
Oh, really?

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.588
- Would you like to come in?
- Sure.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:58.231
She went on holiday
with her father, I believe.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:01.230
No, she didn't.
That's the reason I'm here.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.283
I don't get
many visitors here.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.737
Excuse the clutter.

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.114
You're going away?

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:17.622
Now, are you sure
you're not from the IRS?

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:20.374
No, I'm not
from the IRS.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:23.127
They are the only certainties,
aren't they?

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.797
Death and taxes.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:28.837
Now, who said that?

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.218
I believe
it was Benjamin Franklin.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:34.221
But you didn't come all this way
to talk about taxes, did you?

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.143
No. Frances McCullen.

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.980
You were friends,
weren't you?

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:47.773
We were acquainted for a while,
and then she went away.

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:48.902
Poof.

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:51.943
Not a word.

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:55.530
But that's
young people for you.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.786
They have
their own lives to lead.

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:01.995
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.930
Chopin.

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:15.054
I love Chopin.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:16.385
Don't you?

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.102
I like it
when it fills the room.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:31.111
She helped me choose Morton.

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.694
- Morton?
- Morton, my guard dog.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.664
Who, by the way,
hasn't been fed for...

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.161
I don't know how long now.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.288
Forgive me.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:42.869
Morton, be quiet.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:50.506
Morton, please,
will you keep quiet?

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:55.473
Morton?

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.101
Morton?

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:04.816
Morton?

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:09.942
Stop that banging.

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:46.273
You're not
from the IRS?

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.646
Are you sure?

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:51.229
- Maybe Homeland Security?
- You psycho.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:53.280
We have places
for people like you.

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:57.111
But all my papers are in order.
I'm a naturalized citizen.

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.348
She's in there,
isn't she?

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:01.365
She's having a nap,
like you will have in 20 seconds or so.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.833
I'm taking her with me.

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:09.789
Are you sure?

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:12.091
Help me!

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.052
You don't look too good.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.341
You missed.

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:21.847
Missed again.

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:24.808
Ooh!

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:43.330
Do you have children?

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:45.409
No? A pity.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:47.501
No one to miss you.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:24.206
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.663
<i>Where have you gone.</i>

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:31.337
<i>Without me?</i>

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:32.630
What a mess.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.252
<i>I thought you cared...</i>

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.927
What a dreadful,
terrible mess.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:43.554
The bags, you see,
were the perfect solution.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:48.435
Who would believe
a simple green leather handbag

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.143
would solve
an eternity of loneliness?

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:57.564
Endlessly recycled
through lost and found.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:03.738
"If found,
please return to..."

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:08.750
Oh, yes,
they brought company.

01:24:08.835 --> 01:24:10.918
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.745
The company was nice
for a while,

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:15.001
but everything has
its end, doesn't it?

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:19.086
<i>When we said goodbye, love.</i>

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:21.922
Even company.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:26.476
<i>What had we to gain?</i>

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.473
<i>When I.</i>

01:24:31.567 --> 01:24:36.779
<i>Gave you my love.</i>

01:24:36.863 --> 01:24:41.483
<i>Was it all in vain?</i>

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:49.040
<i>All life through.</i>

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:56.916
<i>Must I go on pretending?</i>

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.551
<i>Where is my.</i>

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:04.506
<i>Happy ending?</i>

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:11.680
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.067
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:25.451
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:25:28.582 --> 01:25:33.077
<i>Where.</i>

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:36.789
<i>Are you?</i>

01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:51.895
Bless your heart...

01:25:58.612 --> 01:26:00.649
Here, let me
give you something.

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.696
No. No, that's okay.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:05.404
Maybe you can come in
for a cup of coffee.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:12.956
That's so pretty.

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:16.165
Thank you.
Here, sit down.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:30.258
I can't
place your accent.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:32.093
I'm from Texas.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.978
<i>Mézeskalács.</i>

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:36.852
I made them myself.

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.854
- Have one.
- Thank you.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:45.232
So,
what brings you to New York?

01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:54.700
Oh, how exciting.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.705
I'm trying to be a model.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:00.584
The neighbors.
I'm sorry.

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:02.624
Remodeling.

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:16.554
A little courtesy, please!
A little quiet!

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.310
Thank you!

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:21.939
I swear they are building an ark.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:29.015
So, tell me,
how does one become a model?

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.826
Well, you get an agent.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:34.531
Actually, first you get
a portfolio, then an agent.

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:43.756
So clumsy.

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:47.001
I'll get a towel.

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:01.815
- Are you okay?
- I...

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:06.021
I feel so strange
all of a sudden.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.151
What...
What kind of strange?

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:10.987
Oh...

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:17.115
Do you... Do you think that
maybe you've been drugged?

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:22.329
Think that happened
to a friend of mine once.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:29.381
The hours and hours I searched
the goddamn subway for that bag.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:32.088
So, what happens now?

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:40.313
You play me the piano,
talk about Liszt and <i>Liebestraum,</i> right?

01:28:43.527 --> 01:28:47.362
Oh, no. You're overdosing.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:51.236
Yeah, that's what a bunch of roofies
in your coffee will do to you.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:52.908
You need a doctor.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.405
And I need my friend.

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:58.034
Where is she?

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:00.876
Frances?

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:06.710
Frances!

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.527
Oh, my God.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.465
And get that one, okay?

01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:04.063
- Are you gonna be able to walk?
- I don't know.

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.607
Hold on to me, okay?

01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:08.104
Come on. Come on.

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:15.613
No! No! No! No! No! No!

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:17.193
No, no, no. Erica, no.

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:18.949
- Erica, don't go.
- I have to, okay?

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:21.142
- Don't go. Don't go. Don't...
- Okay. I have to go look.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.203
No, it's her. She's gonna...
She's gonna hurt you.

01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:25.376
She's...

01:30:49.653 --> 01:30:51.269
She's not here.

01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:02.492
It's just a record.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.086
How the hell did she...

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:30.562
You were the one.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:32.393
Stop! Get off of me!

01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:37.565
No.

01:31:38.618 --> 01:31:40.109
No. No, don't do it.

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:48.621
I have a better idea.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.921
How do we lock this?

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.885
You could try with this.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.786
What do we do now?

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.249
We call the cops.

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:44.347
What do we tell them?

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:50.229
That there's a psychopath
asleep in an old painted box.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:00.231
How long have I been here?

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:04.944
Too long.

01:33:12.462 --> 01:33:14.419
I need to get some air.

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:18.883
Okay. Let's go.

01:33:23.556 --> 01:33:25.513
I need
to call my dad.
