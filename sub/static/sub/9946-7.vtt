looks aren't everything."

14:14.840 --> 14:16.799
You had skin like bubble wrap.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.799
"There are some smells even a
deodorant just can't disguise,
Libby."

14:21.120 --> 14:23.839
You had a traumatic puberty.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.839
I turned down every opportunity
of happiness, just for you.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.439
I could have been a wife, a mother.

That's my point.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.119
Thought we could go out

14:46.480 --> 14:48.039

14:48.040 --> 14:51.439
Well, I didn't think we had to book.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.599

14:52.600 --> 14:54.879

15:35.040 --> 15:37.119

15:52.160 --> 15:55.679
Well, it's not QV-fucking-C, is it?

15:55.680 --> 15:59.679
Look, I don't like doing business
over the phone. It's not convenient.

16:01.080 --> 16:05.079
Who was that?

16:06.600 --> 16:10.599
Jamie?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.199
He's got a lot on.
A lot of pressure.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.239
You both have.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.799
I've not made things
any easier for him.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.439
All I can do it get out of bed
in the mornings.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.679
Jamie's keeping all this going.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.559
I'll have a word.
Might make things a bit easier.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.519

16:27.520 --> 16:31.519
Thank you, but no.
It's husband and wife stuff.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.199

now and then.

28:58.940 --> 29:02.939
So let's do business.

29:02.940 --> 29:03.619
Now.

29:03.620 --> 29:06.739
Now.
It's over.

29:06.740 --> 29:10.739
This is the end.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.579
I'll tell her.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.659
Your lovely wife.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.859
I will tell her.

29:20.860 --> 29:24.859
When and where and how,
and how much I paid and why.

29:25.540 --> 29:29.539
No... I'll tell her.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.339
(IAN SINGING)

29:40.340 --> 29:43.579
Don't start, Micky.
I'm not in the mood.

29:43.580 --> 29:44.659
I'm sayin' nothing.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.939
Oh, good. I've had enough of your
snipin' these past few weeks.

29:47.940 --> 29:50.419
I was just lookin' out for a mate.

29:50.420 --> 29:54.419
You were trying to split us up.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.459
Well, at least you're not denying it.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.459
Just leave us, please.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.219
You know, when it ends,

30:03.220 --> 30:05.299
when it does all fall to pieces,

30:05.300 --> 30:07.339
when you get bored of
messing around

30:07.340 --> 30:11.339
and decide you'd much rather
have a hetero...

30:11.980 --> 30:15.379
..let him down gently, eh?

30:15.380 --> 30:19.379
(CHEERING)

30:20.460 --> 30:21.619
You OK?

30:21.620 --> 30:25.619
You OK?
Yep, I'm good.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.139
Don't think I'm taking orders

30:33.440 --> 30:35.279
off some pissed up slapper
from the Jockey.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.119
I haven't married her, we're just
dating, and she's not a slapper.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.159
Then why involve us?

30:39.160 --> 30:42.159
Cos I like her and it would be nice
if you all liked her an' all.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.879
She's clever and caring,

30:44.880 --> 30:48.839
and if you ever had anything
that you were worrying about,

30:48.840 --> 30:51.359
y'know, she's very understanding.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.599
Well, let's see her then.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.239
Oh, and don't startle her,
for fuck's sake.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.839

30:57.840 --> 31:00.479
She drives a mobile library.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.359

31:05.360 --> 31:07.199
How do you feel about drugs?

(VOICES BLURRED)

31:12.160 --> 31:13.519
If culture's a process,

31:13.520 --> 31:17.519
is a new pattern of behaviour
invented or an old one modified?

31:18.120 --> 31:21.999
Oh, yeah, and she's a narcoleptic.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.999
Really need to up her dose.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.479
It's all right.
The others have gone.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.959
Frightened them off?

31:31.960 --> 31:33.479
Cleared the place.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.759
Frank?

31:34.760 --> 31:37.239
Dropping Stella off.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.239
Bet you've all
had a good laugh at me.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.719
Yep.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.999
Told Frank he should terminate
the friendship.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.319
You don't want 'em hanging round
with someone mentally unstable.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.839
No, that's an advantage.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.239
I see.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.359
Your dad's told me all about you.

31:54.360 --> 31:57.159
Must be hard having so much
upheaval in your life.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.199
And you think a narcoleptic's
going to provide

31:59.200 --> 32:00.479
some much needed stability?

32:00.480 --> 32:02.159
I'm quite nice once
you get to know me.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.799
I'll be the judge of that.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.199
I hope we can be friends.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.839
I doubt it.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.279
Your dad and me...

32:12.280 --> 32:13.879
We're gonna try and make a go of it.

32:13.880 --> 32:14.919
Your funeral.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.759
Of course I wouldn't try
to replace your mum.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.559
Wise,
because I'm not looking for one.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.959
I'm glad we had this chance to talk.

32:20.960 --> 32:24.959
You got spaghetti in your hair.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.679
They hated me, Frank.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.959
The gynaecologist never
prodded me so deeply.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.679
They're just keeping a look out
for me,

32:33.680 --> 32:35.359
I made one or two mistakes
in the past.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.159
What am I getting myself into?

32:37.160 --> 32:41.159
An honest
and committed relationship.

32:43.160 --> 32:47.159
I've got to start the meeting.

32:47.200 --> 32:51.199
(IN ET VOICE) I'll be right here.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.279
OK, everyone, settle down.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.239
Now...Carol, you wanted to...

32:59.240 --> 33:02.679
(SNORING)

33:02.680 --> 33:04.959
She's looking for sponsors for
her hike up Ben Nevis.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.999
Anyone interested can speak to her
after the meeting,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.319
get a sponsorship form.

33:09.320 --> 33:13.159
Now, moving along to discrimination
in the workplace,

33:13.160 --> 33:16.479
I know a lot of members
have suffered.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.279
The world is full of ruthless people

33:19.280 --> 33:23.279
eager to take advantage of
the vulnerable and naive.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.839
The money was about to fall out
of her purse.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.239
I was helping the woman out.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.519
You can treat me like a fool
only once, Frank.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.439
Oh, don't act like some
paragon of virtue.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.879
You're the one that's been
in the nick for inciting a riot.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.719
Yeah, I let my emotions
get the better of me

33:44.720 --> 33:46.599
and I paid my debt to society.

33:46.600 --> 33:50.599
You were about to thieve from a good
friend of mine, a kind, gentle woman,

33:50.960 --> 33:54.959
blind, narcoleptic, and suffering
from the early onset of dementia.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.159
How could ya?

33:56.160 --> 33:57.319
How could ya?
It was the perfect crime.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.799
She wouldn't see me, and if she did
somehow know it was me,

34:00.800 --> 34:03.039
ten minutes later she'd have
fuckin' forgotten.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.799
Ugh!
Libby!

34:04.800 --> 34:06.039
Fuck off, Frank!

your sister?

34:19.920 --> 34:22.039
I could do with drowning me sorrows.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.478
None whatsoever.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.399

What happened to whatshername?

34:27.800 --> 34:29.359
Why not get her over?

34:29.360 --> 34:33.359
Early night for Stella,
a leg over for you.
Might put a smile back on your face.

34:34.440 --> 34:38.438
It's...er...not worked out.

34:38.480 --> 34:42.239
What was all that shit about then?
Introductions and all that?

34:42.239 --> 34:46.239
Well, I thought I could get
what I wanted.

34:47.400 --> 34:48.639
She must be special.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.438
I haven't seen you clean your shoes

34:50.440 --> 34:52.319
since the last time
you were in court.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.319
I told yer...I'm on a promise.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.239
And when you're onto a good thing

34:56.239 --> 34:58.519
you should do everything
in your power

34:58.520 --> 35:02.519
not to let it slip out of yer hands.

35:07.860 --> 35:11.259
You can never trust 'em.
They're like drug addicts, drinkers.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.249

the size of a window box.

35:14.250 --> 35:18.249
Your father was the same. Waster.

35:20.870 --> 35:24.629
Ah, Libby darling, forget him.

35:24.630 --> 35:26.789
You would never have settled
to that,

35:26.790 --> 35:28.669
some sort of mother to his kids,

35:28.670 --> 35:31.469

35:33.510 --> 35:34.749
You thought wrong.

alive.

35:37.470 --> 35:39.269
For the first time in years

35:39.270 --> 35:43.269
I knew what it was like to have
blood coursing through my veins.

Those figs are coursing
right through my system.

Let me finish.

37:52.830 --> 37:55.949
I wasted a good education and every
opportunity was put my way.

37:55.950 --> 37:57.509
I disappointed me mother and father,

37:57.510 --> 37:59.589
I drove away the women
who lovedme,

37:59.590 --> 38:02.989
the children who wanted something
from me, I was incapable of giving,

38:02.990 --> 38:04.749
couldn't wait to see
the back of them,

38:04.750 --> 38:06.149

41:54.430 --> 41:57.949
What are you saying?

41:57.950 --> 42:00.429
Live with me.

42:00.430 --> 42:01.749
Here I am.

42:01.750 --> 42:05.749
Honest...ish,
a "warts and all" autobiography,

42:06.190 --> 42:08.549
bit dog-eared, but a good yarn.

42:08.550 --> 42:12.549
I couldn't possibly,
it's too early, it's too quick.

42:12.990 --> 42:16.989
I need a woman in me life.

42:17.390 --> 42:20.149
But if you take me on,
you take on the kids too.

42:20.150 --> 42:24.149
They need someone gentle and
nurturing, especially the baby.

42:26.390 --> 42:27.749
You've got a baby?

42:27.750 --> 42:29.029
Yeah, Stella.

42:29.030 --> 42:33.029
You hardly notice that she's there,
apart from the smell now and again.

42:34.110 --> 42:35.629
A baby.

(MUSIC STOPS)

42:50.910 --> 42:54.909
I'm sorry.

42:56.910 --> 43:00.909
Are you leaving me?

43:02.190 --> 43:04.269
All that...

43:04.270 --> 43:05.749
Phone calls,

43:05.750 --> 43:08.269
the late nights.

43:08.270 --> 43:12.269
I was just taking care of business.

43:17.710 --> 43:20.189
I know not to get involved
with business.

43:20.190 --> 43:24.189
It goes right over my head.

43:26.030 --> 43:27.669
It's all sorted now.

43:27.670 --> 43:29.989
It's over.

43:29.990 --> 43:33.989
Good.

43:38.030 --> 43:42.029
D'you know, if it all gets too
much...

43:42.550 --> 43:46.549
..and you can't handle it...

43:46.750 --> 43:50.749
..take Connor, and you go.

43:50.910 --> 43:52.829
You just go.

43:52.830 --> 43:56.829
You just go.
No.

44:05.070 --> 44:07.749
Fancy a brew?

44:07.750 --> 44:11.749
Yeah, I'd love one.

(KNOCKING AT THE DOOR)

44:21.630 --> 44:22.749
Libby there?

44:22.750 --> 44:24.429
I'm her mother.

44:24.430 --> 44:27.549
She's, um...

44:27.550 --> 44:31.549
It's all right, I'll wait.

44:33.950 --> 44:37.949
Sorry, son, you'll need
to bring those in.

if I don't tell him.

45:38.710 --> 45:40.309
