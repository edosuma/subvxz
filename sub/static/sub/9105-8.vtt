00:07.257 --> 00:09.885
Eric and I last fucked
two weeks ago.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.272
<i>We've been involved
since the Solstice Party.</i>

00:13.430 --> 00:15.478
YURI: I found that
where Pettigrew was killed.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.359
Standard Fortitude

INGRID: <i>Let me know
where you're calling from.</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:21.238
I don't know.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.114
Don't ever do that to me again,
'cause I do this for you.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.115
SKIPPER:
<i>I take the tusks?</i>

00:24.274 --> 00:25.150
Yeah, they're on board.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.318
I'll take them now.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.782
CARRIE:
<i>Come on, Dad.</i>

00:27.945 --> 00:28.912
<i>We've got to go home.</i>

00:29.071 --> 00:30.994
I'm going to the
mainland in the morning.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.658
I don't want to see
you before I leave.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.997
YURI:
<i>They're all covering for Eric.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:36.252
They're all in it.

HILDUR: I can reassure you that nothing
that has happened recently will

02:31.902 --> 02:33.904
in any way jeopardize
your investment.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.290

02:36.448 --> 02:38.917
Urn, we anticipate starting
the drilling process

02:39.076 --> 02:40.749
in a few days' time.

02:40.911 --> 02:44.336
And, uh, we're looking at first
phase completion in 12 weeks.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.841
All being well.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.001
Everything looks, um...

02:48.168 --> 02:50.011
Sorry, I just need to take this.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.968
Excuse me.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.598
Yes?

02:53.757 --> 02:56.601
DAN:
It's happened again.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.603
Dr. Allerdyce.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.436
She's been attacked.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.061
And Shirley is missing.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.449
I'll go to the government and
see how they're gonna help us

03:11.608 --> 03:13.281
with this, and then I'll come
straight back.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.786
But there's no flights today.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.414
I'll be back tonight,
and, Dan...

03:17.572 --> 03:19.449
you keep your head straight.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.916
My breathing has
gone funny, Dan.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.385
Okay.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.796
Petra, look at me.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.715
Four seconds in
through one nostril.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.383
Hold it for four seconds,
(door opens)

03:36.550 --> 03:39.019
and then four seconds out
through the other nostril.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.805
That should steady
things a little, okay?

03:41.972 --> 03:42.814
Okay.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.101
Ingrid.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.487
Make sure the doc
can breathe okay.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.036
CARRIE:
<i>Does your hand still hurt?</i>

04:05.829 --> 04:07.706
Yeah, some.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.095
We have to go back.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.223
Yeah, I think so now.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.970
(groans)

04:25.265 --> 04:27.142
Are you all right?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.187
Carrie.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.151
Carrie.
Dad.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.566
Carrie.

04:33.732 --> 04:37.032
Dad?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.202
Dad?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.883
I went on a little trip, Henry.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.919
Hmm, good for you.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.844
I got talking to some Russians.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.308
They do get very chatty
over their vodka.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.894
With me, it pretty much depends
on the company.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.903
The Russians seem to think

05:12.062 --> 05:14.690
that there's something
pretty rotten in Fortitude.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.324
How would the Russians
know anything?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.985
The Russians weren't there.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.028
Well, who was there?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.450
Who was there
when Bill Pettigrew died?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.332
Come on, Henry.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.793
Don't fuck me about.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.583
I'm pretty goddamn tired
of being fucked about.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.178
Okay.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.806
The reason I called you--
there was somebody there,

05:39.965 --> 05:41.808
and I saw him.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.219
Big fella.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.513
Light-skinned,
mean eyes.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.932
He stank like
a reindeer's asshole.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.773
Which, to be fair, was probably
the last thing it had eaten.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.154
Okay. Okay.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.985
I might be
dying, Morton,

05:56.147 --> 05:58.991
but watch how
you talk to me.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.993
I can still tell a
hawk from a handsaw.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.369
(door opens)

06:02.529 --> 06:05.032
And a man from a bear.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.373
It's happened again.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.922
Doc Allerdyce.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.550
She's been ripped to pieces.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.464
Thanks a lot, Henry.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.819
WOMAN: Can I get
you more coffee?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.855
I think two's enough, thank you.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.241
If you had an
appointment...

06:40.400 --> 06:42.243
It's an emergency.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.155
You told him I had
to fly back this afternoon?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.575
Yes.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.118
Call him again,
please,

06:49.284 --> 06:51.161
and tell him it's very urgent.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.260
You must feel pretty cut off up
there on Fortitude sometimes.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.465
Sorry?

06:59.628 --> 07:01.881
You must feel pretty cut off.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.094
Isolated.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.929
Cut off from what?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.889
(snickers)

07:07.052 --> 07:08.895
Shops, restaurants.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.900
I don't need those things
to feel connected.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.937
And it's not places
that cut you off.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.030
Could you call him
again, please?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.734
Yes, of course.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.495
Hi, Kent,
it's Hildur Odegard.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.911
Listen, I need
a big favor.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.954
Is your plane
available?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.924
Today.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.341
I-I came as soon
as I heard.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.351
I need to take a statement from
the first person on the scene.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.762
Who is it?

07:49.928 --> 07:53.182
Markus Husekleppe,
Shirley's boyfriend.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.192
And Liam Sutter's
teacher, right?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.853
You make something
of that?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.191
I don't know.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.234
Shall we?

08:08.363 --> 08:10.331
DAN: <i>You said you were
at the miners party?</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:13.164
No, you know
I was there.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.373
I saw you, too.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.788
Until what time?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.376
Until...
I don't know.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.791
2:00 in the morning?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.209
Then you went home.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.219
Mm-hmm, right after
I collected my records.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.630
Your, your what?

08:24.796 --> 08:27.049
I loaned the DJ
some of my records.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.888
I'm a collector
of vinyl.

08:29.050 --> 08:29.972
Classic '80s, mostly.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.356
What was the last
song he played?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.984
Uh, "Enola Gay"
by OMD.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.986
I remember because
I sometimes use that song

08:40.145 --> 08:42.523
in the classroom to teach
the kids about Hiroshima.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.785
Yeah, I can see how that
would further their knowledge.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.786
Well, it gains
their interest.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.788
It's just a device.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.415
Yeah, no, I meant it.

08:52.574 --> 08:56.204
I mean, now they'll never
forget that it was 8:15.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.212
It's good.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.839
More than most
people know.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.750
So you left
the party at...?

09:01.916 --> 09:03.759
2:00 a.m. or thereabouts.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.135
That's right,
you said that.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.137
Straight home?

09:06.296 --> 09:07.138
Uh-huh.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.344
Yeah, I fed Pierre,

09:08.506 --> 09:09.382
let him out.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.721
Pierre being?
His dog.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.720
After Bezukhov.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.059
Of course.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.063
You know him?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.644
Mm-hmm.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.651
Put the cake I bought
for Shirley in the fridge

09:20.810 --> 09:22.107
and went to bed.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.157
How would you describe
your relationship

09:26.316 --> 09:28.068
with Shirley's mother?

09:30.236 --> 09:33.080
How would I describe it?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.116
We got on very well.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.080
That was a stall.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.508
Yes, it was.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.589
I think that was a stall. Hmm.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.972
MORTON: I'm gonna ask
you the question again.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.009
How was your relationship
with Dr. Allerdyce?

10:07.482 --> 10:09.359
Somebody's been in here,
messing about.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.993
There.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.877
(gasps)

10:41.641 --> 10:43.518
(woman gasping)

10:59.659 --> 11:01.377
(gasps)
(gasps)

11:19.262 --> 11:21.139
(grunting)

11:30.106 --> 11:31.983
Carrie.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.987
(groans)

11:37.530 --> 11:39.908
Carrie.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.167
Carrie.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.852
Carrie said she saw them from
the street and followed them in.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.267
Where is she now?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.060
At the hotel getting
some hot soup.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.479
Where's Ronnie?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.113
She left him up
on the glacier.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.114
Arm injury.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.275
Sounds like it could
be septicemia.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.695
I've sent Petra and Ingrid out
to look for him.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.114
Petra's taking
this hard.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.578
Well, she's probably
in the wrong job, then.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.584
This isn't Detroit.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.211
It's getting close.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.624
Shirley needs a postmortem.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.633
But we don't have
anybody to do it.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.262
Our only medic is trying
to save our town doctor.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.514
Shirley Allerdyce died
of a heart attack.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.050
Her hand

12:38.216 --> 12:40.059
is clutching the left side
of her chest.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.812
I'm positive the postmortem
is gonna show plaque

12:42.971 --> 12:44.973
and blood clots and blackening
of the coronary muscle,

12:45.139 --> 12:46.186
which is what happens

12:46.349 --> 12:48.147
when you have a massive AMI.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.903
The only visible injuries

12:51.062 --> 12:54.111
on Shirley were
self defense wounds on her arms.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.696
That was it.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.610
And the blood on the wall

12:57.777 --> 12:59.370
was from Dr. Allerdyce.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.156
Shirley transferred it there.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.662
If...

13:07.829 --> 13:09.422
if Shirley did attack her mom...

13:09.580 --> 13:11.173
No way.
No one will believe that.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.426
Be careful
about saying stuff like that.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.006
It's a legitimate line
of enquiry.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.968
We hold Markus
as long as possible.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.633
We need to talk to him again.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.676
I think he's lying
about his relationship

13:21.843 --> 13:22.969
with Dr. Allerdyce.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.228
I know.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.309
Where you going?

13:25.471 --> 13:28.350
Check on Carrie.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.950
(panting)

13:56.169 --> 13:58.342
They're holding Mr. Husekleppe
at the station.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.006
Markus?
Why are they holding him?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.470
For the attack on Shirley?
That's not important.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.929
The important thing
is it's not Liam.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.719
It's not Liam, Jules.
I don't get it.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.183
Well, I'd rather not get it.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.689
Not getting it is better.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.269
Until now "getting it"
meant Liam was guilty.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.775
You need to slow
down, Frank.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.276
It's ridiculous
to think a kid that size...

14:12.435 --> 14:14.108
You need to let the
police handle this.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.863
I need to know.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.399
I need to know what
we're dealing with here, Jules.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.909
Who are you really trying
to get off the hook?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.620
(scoffs)

14:39.212 --> 14:41.715
"A."

14:46.052 --> 14:48.100
Have you found him?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.014
No, not yet.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.776
"F."

14:56.104 --> 14:57.230
He knows.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.024
He knows?

14:59.190 --> 15:00.988
I'm a mind-reader.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.743
I know people better
than they know themselves.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.870
Wow.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.124
He doesn't even know what
he had for breakfast.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.625
I didn't have any breakfast.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.377
And I, uh,

15:11.536 --> 15:13.083
could do with a coffee
right about now.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.545
ELENA:
<i>She was a good person.</i>

15:16.707 --> 15:18.380
Yes, she was.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.886
Yes.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.967
But there are some questions.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.262
(sighs)

15:25.425 --> 15:28.144
She had no injuries.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.849
She was...

15:30.012 --> 15:31.980
soaked in her mother's blood-.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.194
She had defense wounds

15:36.352 --> 15:37.353
which are...

15:37.520 --> 15:38.521
I know what they are.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.576
And-and her heart attack

15:43.734 --> 15:45.907
could have been brought on by...

15:46.070 --> 15:48.493
No.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.999
Well, I said could.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.705
We-we don't know yet.
No.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.291
Shirley wasn't capable
of that kind of violence.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.081
I am not trying
to blame Shirley.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.625
I'm...

15:58.791 --> 16:01.840
I'm just trying to understand
what's happening to us.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.634
How is she?

16:10.845 --> 16:13.394
Scared.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.433
But coping.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.562
Look after her.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.197
Okay.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.232
At least until we find Ronnie.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.653
Okay.
Okay.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.665
Dan?

16:34.535 --> 16:37.163
Whatever's happening to us?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.207
Shirley was a victim.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.876
There's something else going on.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.885
Something much worse.

16:55.765 --> 16:56.812
CIARAN:
Dan!

16:56.974 --> 16:58.817
What the fuck is going on?

16:58.976 --> 17:00.102
I'm pretty busy just now.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.192
CELIA: It was the teacher
that found them?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.823
Not "them."

17:03.981 --> 17:05.654
He found Doc Allerdyce.

17:05.816 --> 17:06.817
Dan, how much do we even know
about this guy?

17:06.983 --> 17:08.861
You know, Frank Sutter says...

17:09.028 --> 17:11.156
Well, you see Frank, you tell
him to come and talk to me.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.368
This is outsiders.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.499
Russians probably.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.875
Thanks for the tip.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.455
Well, you should be
rounding them up,

17:16.618 --> 17:18.496
interrogating them.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.674
I've got a lot on my plate.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.881
And some asshole
just out of Donegal

17:25.044 --> 17:27.217
talking about rounding up
"outsiders."

17:27.380 --> 17:29.883
I could do without that
just now.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.974
If you don't, we will.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.557
(engine starts)

18:02.206 --> 18:04.049
(muffled sobbing)

18:04.208 --> 18:06.882
ALSTAD: <i>It's a disturbing
development, as you say.</i>

18:07.044 --> 18:08.261
Yes.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.173
You must be concerned
about its implications

18:10.339 --> 18:11.556
for your hotel project.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.764
No, I'm concerned

18:13.926 --> 18:16.145
about its implications
for the island.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.601
Indeed. (chuckles)

18:17.763 --> 18:20.733
Well, I shall take it up
with the subcommittee.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.518
Good. When?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.733
We meet on Mondays.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.818
But that's too late.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.153
We need help right now.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.739
There are competing demands...

18:30.901 --> 18:32.198
Involving people

18:32.361 --> 18:34.113
being ripped open?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.953
Look, I'm not unsympathetic...

18:36.115 --> 18:37.537
I'm not asking
for sympathy here.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.917
I'm asking for forensic teams.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.077
You know we are facing

18:40.244 --> 18:42.292
cuts right now.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.210
Two attacks might seem
a lot on Fortitude.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.008
You're not gonna send
any extra resources, are you?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.302
I think it will be difficult

18:56.469 --> 18:59.313
to persuade people
of the urgency.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.815
Right.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.476
Because we are
a small, faraway island

19:03.643 --> 19:04.815
that doesn't matter.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.978
Of course you matter.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.397
Because we have a dying economy,

19:07.563 --> 19:09.315
we have a falling rate
of childbirth,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.075
we have no votes.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.610
Because if we're lucky,

19:12.777 --> 19:15.371
we might survive
as a remote weather station.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.408
Your car is here.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.874
Thank you.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.549
Right.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.968
Thanks for the coffee.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.870
(dog barking)

20:12.294 --> 20:14.843
(sighs)

20:16.298 --> 20:18.175
(barking continues)

20:26.392 --> 20:28.269
(phone rings)

20:31.272 --> 20:32.364
HILDUR:
It's me.

20:32.523 --> 20:33.866
I was calling you.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.947
I wasn't answering.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.033
I got that impression.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.875
Is Dr. Allerdyce still alive?

20:43.033 --> 20:45.081
She still has a faint pulse.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.587
I'm coming home.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.248
How?

20:48.414 --> 20:50.758
Well, Kent Larsson
has that little Learjet.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.135
You are scared of flying.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.342
Wait for a proper flight, Hildy.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.310
(scoffs)
Want to know something funny?

21:01.469 --> 21:03.938
They're playing Buddy Holly
in my lobby here.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.723
That's not funny.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.892
You want to know something else?

21:08.058 --> 21:10.902
Remember how I always hold
your hand at takeoff?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.065
I'm not scared at all now.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.575
Of anything.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.361
So...

21:18.527 --> 21:20.575
at least you've achieved that.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.372
(dogs barking)

21:33.250 --> 21:34.718
(growling)

21:41.842 --> 21:44.015
I'm not far now, Carrie darling.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.475
I'm not far now.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.223
Oh, my God, I'm poisoned.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.360
I'm so fucking poisoned.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.106
(sobbing)

22:21.173 --> 22:23.050
(phone dings, buzzes)

22:53.497 --> 22:56.421
♪♪

23:07.469 --> 23:09.346
What else did you
do last night?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.434
Henning saw you.
What are they doing to that man?

23:13.601 --> 23:14.648
Take, take his fucking
trousers down.

23:14.810 --> 23:18.280
Are you cold?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.157
Do you want to
freeze to death?

23:20.316 --> 23:22.739
Henning saw you!
Hey. Hey.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.825
Do you understand me?
Hey!

23:24.987 --> 23:25.909
What are you doing?

23:27.865 --> 23:29.367
Just asking him a few questions.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.910
Russian bastard spat at me, too.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.123
ELENA: No, you can't,
you can't do that.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.332
A bunch of them were out
drinking last night.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.796
We just want to know what
else they were doing.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.255
Carrie, come.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.422
Do you know

23:43.589 --> 23:45.341
the names of these men?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.350
Ciaran Donnelly.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.554
Jake Roach.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.974
And that's

23:53.140 --> 23:54.733
Henning Bergstrom.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.079
Come.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.164
(sniffs)

24:14.620 --> 24:15.712
Slut!

24:19.500 --> 24:21.377
Don't worry about him.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.805
Nobody likes him.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.432
My dad says he's a knob.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.467
Yeah.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.511
Yes.
I want to go to home.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.225
Carrie,

24:32.388 --> 24:34.482
you can't stay on your own.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.063
Then you could come, too.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.649
There's loads of room.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.406
We could wait there
together for Dad.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.077
Okay.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.533
(chuckles)

24:48.696 --> 24:51.370
Okay.

24:58.706 --> 24:59.878
Where have you been?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.292
The teacher's.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.755
There's all other kinds
of weird shit.

25:02.918 --> 25:03.965
Funnels

25:04.128 --> 25:06.005
and scales and stuff.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.935
What's all this?

25:26.275 --> 25:27.447
Where did you get this?

25:27.609 --> 25:28.485
His house.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.364
I broke in.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.702
Why?

25:32.865 --> 25:33.866
I knew he wasn't there.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.035
MORTON:
He's a feeder.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.454
Yeah, not only that.
Where is it?

25:43.625 --> 25:45.878
Huh?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.508
Leave this with us.
Now what you gonna do?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.019
What's more important right now
is what you're going to do.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.851
You're going to go
and look for Ronnie.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.811
I want to be there when
you question him. No.

25:57.973 --> 25:58.815
For Christ's sakes, Dan...

25:58.974 --> 26:00.396
Frank!

26:00.559 --> 26:03.813
Last night, you punched me
in the face and I did nothing.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.153
Today, you broke into
a man's house,

26:07.316 --> 26:09.410
a man who is only
a witness at present...

26:09.568 --> 26:10.740
No, it's him!
...and possibly

26:10.903 --> 26:12.120
jeopardized our investigation.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.531
So be very clear,

26:13.697 --> 26:15.950
my next step will be
to arrest you,

26:16.116 --> 26:18.835
unless you make yourself scarce
and go look for Ronnie.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.917
But it's him!

26:21.080 --> 26:23.629
He's a freak and he's got my son
involved in all this weird shit.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.213
MORTON:
Frank.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.093
Listen to the sheriff.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.129
We'll handle it.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.769
How did you...?

26:35.928 --> 26:37.805
Never mind that.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.776
Well, these were taken
during a hunting trip.

26:42.935 --> 26:46.189
It's tradition here
to anoint the kids

26:46.355 --> 26:48.232
with the blood
of the first kill.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.578
I want a lawyer.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.204
That can be arranged.

26:54.363 --> 26:57.583
I'm not answering any questions
without a lawyer.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.586
Okay.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.247
We can do this
without questions.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.881
I'm not having any...

27:05.040 --> 27:07.543
We'll talk about
literature.

27:07.709 --> 27:11.964
I read this book once;
it was about religion.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.008
And I'm not a particularly
spiritual guy.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.676
You surprise me.

27:15.843 --> 27:20.064
And there was an image in
the book that stuck with me.

27:20.222 --> 27:24.602
It was the image of, um,
the world as an aquarium,

27:24.768 --> 27:27.396
and inside it is

27:27.563 --> 27:29.031
human life.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.238
Like all the little fishes.

27:32.401 --> 27:36.122
And we're looking at them
from all different perspectives

27:36.280 --> 27:37.827
and angles
and in different lights.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.617
Peeping Tom.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.660
Yeah, I guess so, yes.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.046
Yes, something
like that. Yeah.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.834
Maybe that's what
God is, a-a voyeur.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.550
Great cop up in the sky
looking down on us.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.134
That's an interesting thought.

27:53.297 --> 27:58.394
Anyway, I look into this
aquarium, and I see Markus.

27:58.552 --> 28:02.807
Markus the town
schoolteacher.

28:02.973 --> 28:07.604
The lover of Russian
literature, of dogs,

28:07.769 --> 28:11.444
of classic '80s vinyl.

28:11.607 --> 28:15.407
And I also see Markus,

28:15.569 --> 28:18.368
who's a man that has
a very interesting relationship

28:18.530 --> 28:19.656
with his mother.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.812
I'm assuming that is Mom.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.819
My mother has nothing
to do with this.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.821
Why...

28:51.980 --> 28:53.573
Where you get these things?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.110
No questions, remember?

28:56.276 --> 28:58.153
Goes both ways.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.744
Do you want
to tell him?

29:11.208 --> 29:14.257
Shirley Allerdyce...

29:14.419 --> 29:19.050
is lying in the morgue
after attacking her own mother.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.596
Shirley?

29:23.762 --> 29:26.390
DAN:
She's dead, Markus.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.433
We found her dead.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.273
Your girlfriend.

29:34.439 --> 29:37.409
Just like Liam Sutter
was your pupil.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.369
How?

29:54.084 --> 29:56.462
I never...

29:56.628 --> 29:59.131
I would never hurt...

30:02.551 --> 30:04.895
I loved her.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.306
Love?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.474
You were feeding her
to death.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.241
I'm innocent.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.823
No.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.080
One way or another,
you're a killer.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.457
I don't know.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.584
You don't know what?

30:28.744 --> 30:30.587
The signs.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.623
What you're looking for.

30:36.126 --> 30:40.131
You throw all this stuff at me,
and you obviously want

30:40.297 --> 30:43.597
some reaction--
he remained calm,

30:43.759 --> 30:48.936
he got angry
or sarcastic or tearful--

30:49.097 --> 30:52.317
and all I feel...

30:54.770 --> 30:58.525
...is like laughing.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.567
Like I'm just going to laugh.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.630
When do you anoint it?

31:13.789 --> 31:15.086
With the blood, I mean.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.125
When it is ready.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.889
When I was a boy, we used
to go down to the beach.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.972
One time,
during the war,

31:26.134 --> 31:29.729
we found an American
airman sitting down there

31:29.888 --> 31:32.482
all alone
outside his tent,

31:32.641 --> 31:34.860
just staring at the sea.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.861
We cheeked him.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.522
(chuckles softly)

31:38.688 --> 31:39.985
"Hey, Mister,

31:40.148 --> 31:43.448
why aren't you
flying your plane?"

31:43.610 --> 31:47.410
And he said he was just about
to go on his last mission.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.997
Packed up, gave us what
was left of his food,

31:51.159 --> 31:54.379
and we watched
him head off.

31:54.538 --> 31:58.008
Just like that.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.761
No lonely impulse
of delight,

32:01.920 --> 32:05.720
no rage at the
dying light,

32:05.882 --> 32:08.010
just matter of fact.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.055
So you never knew
if he, um, survived?

32:14.808 --> 32:17.982
But I wish I could
be like that airman.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.318
Maybe he's living
in retirement in Idaho.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.376
Do you believe, Henry?

32:32.534 --> 32:35.458
Do you truly believe this?

32:35.620 --> 32:37.918
Doesn't matter
what I believe.

32:38.081 --> 32:41.301
People need myths
and stories.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.303
DAN:
<i>So what do you make of it?</i>

32:43.462 --> 32:45.965
Now you want my opinion?

32:46.131 --> 32:47.883
I didn't say I liked you.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.801
(chuckles softly)

32:51.928 --> 32:53.851
(sighs)

32:54.014 --> 32:59.111
I think a man
who's playing a part... laughs.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.943
He doesn't say
he feels like laughing.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.699
Do you know what I mean?

33:04.858 --> 33:08.078
I think we should let him
go home and feed Pierre.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.909
You think we should let him go?

33:10.071 --> 33:12.199
Yeah. Because
what do we have?

33:12.365 --> 33:14.413
Weak circumstantial stuff,

33:14.576 --> 33:17.329
a bunch of
psychological nonsense

33:17.496 --> 33:20.420
and a lot of
inadmissible weirdness

33:20.582 --> 33:22.425
stolen from his house.

33:22.584 --> 33:25.087
I suspect a lawyer will have
a lot of questions about that.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.302
I guess we can always
reel him back in.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.308
Yeah, but I don't think
he's the fish

33:30.467 --> 33:32.765
that we want.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.812
(door closes)

33:37.974 --> 33:39.817
RONNIE:
Carrie? Love, are you here?

33:39.976 --> 33:41.273
Carrie?

33:41.436 --> 33:43.234
(panting)

33:43.396 --> 33:45.273
Carrie, love, are you here?

33:50.737 --> 33:52.580
(projector playing quietly)

33:52.739 --> 33:54.457
Carrie?

33:55.617 --> 33:57.164
Carrie?

33:57.327 --> 33:59.204
(women singing over projector)

34:03.208 --> 34:05.085
(panting)

34:16.596 --> 34:18.473
(singing continues
over projector)

34:31.777 --> 34:34.031
Carrie?

34:34.197 --> 34:36.495
Carrie, love, is that you?

34:36.658 --> 34:37.955
Look, love, it's your mum.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.043
She's teaching piano.

34:42.205 --> 34:43.502
She...

34:49.670 --> 34:51.547
(sharp thud)

34:52.799 --> 34:54.346
(projector rattling)

34:58.513 --> 35:00.390
♪♪

35:23.371 --> 35:24.839
(crowd clamoring)
DAN: Quieten down!

35:24.998 --> 35:26.750
Would everybody just keep calm!

35:26.916 --> 35:28.384
But, Dan, we've got
a serial killer on the loose,

35:28.543 --> 35:29.920
and you want us to stay calm!

35:30.086 --> 35:32.054
DAN: We don't know if
we have a serial killer.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.466
So far,
the casualty rate is one.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.805
Oh, what about poor Shirley?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.184
We think she died
of natural causes.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.721
(crowd murmuring)

35:38.887 --> 35:40.355
Natural causes? Don't give
me that, Dan. Come on.

35:40.513 --> 35:41.685
This is all down to us.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.192
The island won't let us do this!

35:44.351 --> 35:46.979
It will shrug us off.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.900
The animals are already
showing the signs.

35:51.066 --> 35:52.784
Tell them.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.159
I'm a newcomer.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.741
I don't think...

35:57.280 --> 35:58.657
In general,
I-I'm not sure

35:58.823 --> 35:59.949
about that kind
of Gaia theory.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.618
I think it works
more as a metaphor

36:01.785 --> 36:03.287
than science
in many ways.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.376
But it's true,
there appears to be

36:05.538 --> 36:07.085
some strange behavior
among the animals here...

36:07.248 --> 36:09.125
And what are we doing?

36:09.292 --> 36:11.135
Building ice-hotels.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.295
(crowd murmuring)

36:12.462 --> 36:14.464
Investors over people

36:14.631 --> 36:16.554
every time for the governor!

36:16.716 --> 36:18.844
You don't know what you're
talking about, you old cunt.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.388
Investors are people.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.478
And they're the only ones
that matter to her, aren't they?

36:24.641 --> 36:26.393
You sharing the kickback, are you?
Shut your mouth, Henry!

36:26.559 --> 36:28.527
(gunshot, people screaming)

36:28.687 --> 36:29.563
DAN:
Who fired?!

36:29.729 --> 36:31.026
Who fired their gun?!

36:31.189 --> 36:34.159
My foot! My fucking foot! Oh!

36:34.317 --> 36:35.193
CIARAN:
He's shot himself.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.862
Accidentally.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.530
Get that idiot out of here
and find him

36:38.697 --> 36:40.699
a plaster or something.
Come on, Charlie, man up.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.741
It's just the end
of your toe.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.285
DAN:
Put your guns down

36:43.451 --> 36:45.829
and keep your safeties on,
for God's sakes.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.338
Dan,

36:47.497 --> 36:49.044
why'd you release the teacher?

36:49.207 --> 36:50.424
Markus Husekleppe.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.176
(crowd murmuring)

36:52.335 --> 36:53.928
He's obviously connected.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.839
He's been manipulating
people in some way.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.257
Shirley, my son Liam--

36:57.424 --> 36:58.721
they're his victims.

36:58.883 --> 36:59.930
Okay, okay.

37:00.093 --> 37:01.845
Wait, wait.
(crowd clamoring)

37:02.011 --> 37:03.308
He's only been here
for a few years.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.814
Nobody knows
anything about him.

37:04.973 --> 37:05.940
JASON:
Yeah, exactly.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.100
Bring him in and ask him...

37:07.267 --> 37:08.610
DAN: Would everyone
just hush up

37:08.768 --> 37:11.237
so Jules can speak?
People are scared, Dan.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.694
That's all we really
want you to understand here.

37:13.857 --> 37:16.076
Nothing like this
has ever happened here before.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.408
This isn't Fortitude.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.040
My son, my little boy
is just lying there,

37:22.198 --> 37:24.075
and we need answers.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.040
I know. I understand.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.704
CIARAN: We don't need
your understanding;

37:27.871 --> 37:29.339
we need to know

37:29.497 --> 37:30.965
what you're
going to do about it.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.377
You sort this out, or we will!
(crowd clamoring)

37:33.543 --> 37:34.715
Oh, yeah? How?

37:34.878 --> 37:36.505
By shooting off a few more toes?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.048
This is your job.
It's not ours.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.683
You're the fucking sheriff!
(crowd clamoring)

37:40.842 --> 37:43.812
You're the one we pay to
take care of shit like this.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.187
We need answers.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.598
(clamoring continues)

37:46.765 --> 37:49.018
WOMAN:
We need answers now!

37:49.184 --> 37:51.778
(clamoring dies down)

37:57.025 --> 37:59.198
I've just been
to see Margaret Allerdyce--

37:59.360 --> 38:01.203
our doctor.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.453
And I, uh...

38:06.409 --> 38:09.003
I sat by her bed, and I...

38:09.162 --> 38:12.211
I thought about all the times
she's helped me and...

38:12.373 --> 38:14.046
been there for me.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.383
For all of us, really.

38:17.545 --> 38:20.469
She gave us our jabs, she...

38:20.632 --> 38:24.262
came out in driving blizzards
when our children were ill.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.891
I want us to think
of her for a moment.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.152
Let's have a moment
of silence and thought

38:32.310 --> 38:34.187
for our good friend,

38:34.354 --> 38:36.527
who's lying in a
hospital bed right now

38:36.689 --> 38:38.487
fighting for her life.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.208
(wind whistling)

39:12.976 --> 39:14.478
Thank you.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.652
Now, if we can all stay calm,

39:18.815 --> 39:22.194
I'm sure we can work together
to overcome this difficult time.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.033
CELIA: We need help
from the mainland.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.287
(others murmuring in agreement)

39:25.446 --> 39:26.914
Yes.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.292
And we will have it.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.123
(wind howling)

39:44.632 --> 39:47.761
CARRIE: There should be
a spare key under the bin.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.179
ELENA:
Okay.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.643
Cross fingers.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.479
(clears throat)

39:56.227 --> 39:58.400
Is there? Here?

39:58.563 --> 40:00.565
Is there?

40:00.732 --> 40:02.530
Great.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.297
(projector flicking)

40:26.174 --> 40:28.268
How come that's on?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.517
I don't know.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.089
(electrical buzzing)

41:02.251 --> 41:03.719
(gasps)

41:03.878 --> 41:05.551
What happened?

41:05.713 --> 41:07.590
It's okay.
It's okay, Carrie.

41:07.757 --> 41:11.057
Um, do you know
where the fuse box is?

41:11.219 --> 41:13.893
It's by the back door.

41:14.055 --> 41:16.478
Okay.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.643
Wait.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.245
(gasps)
(Carrie chuckles)

41:29.404 --> 41:32.078
Carrie, come on.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.413
(chuckling):
Holy...

41:34.575 --> 41:35.872
Show me the way.

41:54.637 --> 41:55.809
Night, Eric.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.565
Night.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.195
Sheriff.

42:05.565 --> 42:09.160
I thought that the governor
handled that very well.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.821
Well, that's why
she's the governor.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.286
You handled it pretty well, too.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.577
"Casualty rate is one."

42:16.743 --> 42:18.962
Good point.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.248
Yes.

42:21.414 --> 42:24.509
Assuming that Bill Pettigrew
was what you said he was

42:24.667 --> 42:26.761
and not a casualty.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.511
Ask me any question you want.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.725
Don't worry. I will.

42:35.887 --> 42:36.934
(chuckles)

42:38.264 --> 42:41.108
Okay.

42:41.267 --> 42:42.439
See you tomorrow, then.

42:42.602 --> 42:43.899
Yep.

43:03.039 --> 43:04.916
(humming a tune)

43:20.348 --> 43:22.225
(knocking)

43:56.509 --> 43:57.556
Hey.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.937
I was with Carrie.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.849
She's asleep, at last.

44:03.015 --> 44:05.143
Good.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.903
I just wanted to check
and see if you were okay.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.649
We're fine.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.660
Bit of a scare when
all the lights went out,

44:14.819 --> 44:18.414
but it was just, um,
a fuse tripping.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.450
Okay.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.546
You were nice earlier.

44:25.705 --> 44:28.549
With Carrie.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.585
Kind.

44:31.961 --> 44:34.805
She's a good kid.

44:34.964 --> 44:37.717
We need to find her dad.

44:37.884 --> 44:40.763
She says I'm like
her big sister.

44:45.183 --> 44:47.185
Do you like that idea?

44:47.351 --> 44:50.355
Yes. Yeah.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.398
(soft giggle)

44:56.152 --> 44:58.575
(sighs)

44:58.738 --> 45:00.490
Space and light.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.954
That was all I wanted
when I came here.

45:08.247 --> 45:11.797
I haven't handled
things well, Elena.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.132
What things?

45:14.295 --> 45:15.763
Us.

45:15.922 --> 45:18.721
What us?

45:19.884 --> 45:22.057
(shrieking)

45:22.220 --> 45:23.221
Carrie.

45:24.764 --> 45:26.232
Carrie.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.482
My dad.

45:27.642 --> 45:28.768
He was here.

45:28.935 --> 45:31.108
I saw him.
Oh...

45:31.270 --> 45:34.023
Carrie, there's no one here.

45:34.190 --> 45:36.659
Okay? I think it was just

45:36.817 --> 45:39.286
a dream. Okay?

45:41.364 --> 45:43.617
Come on.

45:47.620 --> 45:50.499
Let's get you back to sleep.
Okay?

45:52.333 --> 45:54.631
I have to try and get
her back to sleep.

45:54.794 --> 45:57.968
Okay, I'll go.
(softly crying)

45:58.130 --> 45:59.598
I'll call you
in the morning.

45:59.757 --> 46:03.682
Okay... okay.

46:05.346 --> 46:07.644
Let's go. Hmm?

46:19.735 --> 46:21.612

dog barking)

46:35.876 --> 46:38.004

48:28.531 --> 48:31.080
Now pay attention,

48:31.242 --> 48:33.415
because it's my turn
to take the lesson.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.921
It's truth time, you fucker.

48:43.379 --> 48:46.258
We keep the lid on Allerdyce.

48:50.803 --> 48:51.895
I would like to know
how he walked

48:52.054 --> 48:54.853
seven miles in his shirt sleeves

48:55.015 --> 48:57.188

DAN: So you want to examine

48:57.351 --> 48:58.728
