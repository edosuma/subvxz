<i>They're coming!</i>

00:29.947 --> 00:32.950
<i>- Let's go to the water!
- They're heading for the beach!</i>

00:32.991 --> 00:34.576
<i>Down by the beach!</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:35.827
<i>- Run!
- Look out!</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:37.955
<i>Run, Doc! No! Doc, no!</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:40.165
<i>Don't stop moving!</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:41.959
<i>They're down there!</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:43.919
<i>There they go! Okay.</i>

00:44.086 --> 00:47.256
<i>Lay down! Lay down!
Lay down or I'll shoot you, goddamn it!</i>

00:47.297 --> 00:48.799
<i>- Hurry up!
- Lay down!</i>

00:50.759 --> 00:52.511
<i>That's right, shoot them!</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:01.687
<i>I give up, Mr. Glenn. Please!</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:04.940
<i>- Shut up, Henri!
- Please, don't hit me! Please!</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:08.986
<i>Clean him up! Take him to the hole!
And call the press!</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:12.030
<i>Dateline: San Francisco.</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:15.784
<i>Alcatraz was the scene last night
of a dramatic escape attempt.</i>

01:15.951 --> 01:18.120
<i>Four desperate prisoners
were apprehended...</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:20.205
<i>...on the rocky beach below the prison.</i>

01:20.289 --> 01:23.834
<i>The recently completed
Golden Gate Bridge serves as a backdrop.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:26.336
<i>So near, yet so far from freedom...</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:31.133
<i>...the surviving escapees, Henri Young
and Rufus McCain are escorted back...</i>

01:31.842 --> 01:35.512
<i>...while their less fortunate cohorts
are destined for the morgue.</i>

01:36.054 --> 01:40.309
<i>The body of Doc Barker,
son of the infamous Ma Barker...</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:43.562
<i>...lies bullet-riddled,
cooling on a steel gurney...</i>

01:43.687 --> 01:45.856
<i>...attended by a triumphant guard.</i>

01:47.149 --> 01:50.694
<i>The jubilant correctional officers
who foiled the escape...</i>

01:50.861 --> 01:54.698
<i>...congratulate each other
and reluctantly show their battle scars.</i>

01:55.574 --> 01:59.203
<i>A proud Warden Humson,
supervisor of three penitentiaries...</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:03.790
<i>...Folsom, San Quentin and Alcatraz,
and confidant of J. Edgar Hoover...</i>

02:04.082 --> 02:06.001
<i>...congratulates his troops.</i>

02:09.086 --> 02:10.756
<i>Humson returns to his duties...</i>

02:10.839 --> 02:13.675
<i>...as the inmates are sent
through metal detectors...</i>

02:13.717 --> 02:16.845
<i>...cells are searched,
extra guards are called up...</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:21.725
<i>...and Alcatraz goes on full alert
to forestall any additional trouble.</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:24.978
<i>As public interest reached a frenzy...</i>

02:25.312 --> 02:27.940
<i>...Warden Humson
and Associate Warden Glenn...</i>

02:28.023 --> 02:30.776
<i>...left the island in the bay
for a press conference...</i>

02:30.859 --> 02:33.612
<i>...headed for the San Francisco City Hall...</i>

02:33.695 --> 02:38.450
<i>...which was inundated with a plethora
of reporters from around the globe...</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:41.912
<i>...all gathered to hear the official reaction.</i>

02:42.412 --> 02:44.748
<i>Associate Warden Milton Glenn...</i>

02:44.831 --> 02:47.251
<i>...introduces Warden John Humson.</i>

02:48.043 --> 02:51.380
Warden Humson will now make
a brief statement and...

02:51.922 --> 02:55.133
...if you please, no questions at the end.
Thank you.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.387
I just want to reassure
the American people that...

02:59.429 --> 03:02.057
...Alcatraz is an escape-proof prison.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.810
They have nothing to fear.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.105
<i>The inmates, McCain and Young...</i>

03:08.939 --> 03:11.441
<i>...will be brought up on escape charges.</i>

03:11.733 --> 03:14.403
<i>There will be time in solitary confinement.</i>

03:14.570 --> 03:17.239
<i>Privileges will be taken away from them.</i>

03:17.573 --> 03:20.993
And the whole rehabilitation process
will begin.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.351
<i>Definition of rehabilitate:</i>

03:46.977 --> 03:49.146
<i>"To restore to a state of physical...</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:52.608
<i>"...mental and moral health
through treatment and training."</i>

04:00.157 --> 04:01.116
Hello.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.452
Hello, hello, hello.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.999
Eleven times 11...

04:10.834 --> 04:12.002
...121.

...169.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.481
Fourteen times 14...

04:33.857 --> 04:36.360
<i>When Henri Young began
his rehabilitation...</i>

04:36.527 --> 04:39.655
<i>...I was in my first year of law school
at Harvard.</i>

04:55.712 --> 04:57.005
How long?

05:23.282 --> 05:27.411
<i>Alcatraz was opened as
a federal penitentiary in the spring of 1934.</i>

05:28.370 --> 05:30.539
<i>In the era of the gangster...</i>

05:30.747 --> 05:34.209
<i>...it was opened more for
the publicity value than the incarceration.</i>

05:34.293 --> 05:37.546
<i>Alcatraz was the most feared prison
in the world...</i>

05:37.588 --> 05:39.339
<i>...and the most expensive.</i>

05:39.423 --> 05:42.342
<i>There were only so many Al Capones
and Machine Gun Kellys...</i>

05:43.218 --> 05:45.387
<i>...so the prison had empty cells.</i>

05:45.721 --> 05:50.392
<i>To justify the costs, the government took
incorrigibles from other prisons...</i>

05:50.601 --> 05:53.687
<i>...men that had committed smaller,
more petty crimes...</i>

05:54.438 --> 05:56.190
<i>...men like Henri Young.</i>

05:59.276 --> 06:01.486
"Our Father who art in heaven.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.281
"Hallowing be Thy name."

06:05.908 --> 06:09.119
<i>Prior to 1938, there had been
five escape attempts.</i>

06:09.745 --> 06:10.954
<i>No one had made it.</i>

06:11.038 --> 06:14.541
<i>The reputation of Alcatraz as being
unescapable was secure.</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:16.877
<i>Six inmates had died.</i>

06:17.336 --> 06:20.172
<i>The ones who didn't die
sometimes wished they had.</i>

06:32.476 --> 06:35.687
<i>The federal guideline regarding
solitary confinement states...</i>

06:35.771 --> 06:39.733
<i>...that the maximum stay for an inmate
shall not exceed 19 days.</i>

06:51.662 --> 06:53.914
<i>"Our Father who art in heaven.</i>

06:54.915 --> 06:56.750
<i>"Hallowed be Thy name.</i>

06:57.292 --> 07:00.295
<i>"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...</i>

07:01.296 --> 07:03.465
<i>"...on earth, as it is in heaven.</i>

07:04.299 --> 07:06.718
"Give us this day our daily bread.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.055
"And forgive us for our trespasses...

07:10.347 --> 07:13.475
"...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.812
"And lead us not into temptation...

07:17.020 --> 07:19.231
"...but deliver us from evil.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.983
"Amen."

07:22.150 --> 07:23.694
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.930
<i>Alcatraz is a half-mile
off the coast of San Francisco.</i>

07:52.055 --> 07:55.517
<i>There were 276 inmates,
110 guards with their wives...</i>

07:55.684 --> 07:58.061
<i>...and children stationed on the island.</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:00.939
<i>And the Associate Warden, Mr. Glenn.</i>

08:04.943 --> 08:07.613
<i>This is the story of Henri Young
as I know it.</i>

08:12.576 --> 08:13.702
1936:

08:14.203 --> 08:17.706
American League Yankees visiting
National League Giants.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.586
The Yankees score 18 runs...

08:22.878 --> 08:26.924
...a series record and every single man
in that lineup hits at least once.

08:27.758 --> 08:31.637
Every single man in that lineup scores
at least one run.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.087
Daddy!

09:05.629 --> 09:06.630
Hello.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.507
Have you been a good boy?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.300
Take Daddy's lunchbox.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.219
We'll go see Mommy.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.883
Good news, Henri.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.219
It's over. You're out of the hole.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.762
You stink, boy.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.237
I did it. I made it.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.406
Come on.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.825
- Did good.
- I made it.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.160
I did it. I did it. I did it.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.538
They were fucking killing you.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.415
You did good.

11:46.456 --> 11:50.085
<i>The only other survivor
of the escape attempt was Rufus McCain.</i>

11:50.294 --> 11:54.173
<i>He had betrayed his fellow inmates
by tipping off the associate warden.</i>

11:54.298 --> 11:57.759
<i>McCain was rewarded
and left in the general population.</i>

11:58.177 --> 11:59.970
<i>Henri Young was sent to solitary.</i>

12:00.762 --> 12:01.722
Come on.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.602
<i>Henri.</i>

12:10.314 --> 12:12.524
Some men are broken...

12:13.317 --> 12:15.444
...by the laws that they break...

12:17.112 --> 12:18.947
...unable to resist...

12:19.781 --> 12:22.284
...the forces that are pulling them down.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.786
Other men...

12:25.454 --> 12:27.331
...live by the rules...

12:27.623 --> 12:29.708
...that society has set down.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.802
You're not one of them.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.770
Henri, I have a job to do here at Alcatraz.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.563
Do you know what that is?

12:51.855 --> 12:53.482
To protect you...

12:53.982 --> 12:55.526
...from yourself.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.488
You were among the selected sinners...

12:59.530 --> 13:02.658
...the state set apart
so that you could simmer in scum.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.662
The good people of the United States
have decided...

13:07.162 --> 13:09.164
...that you are better off here.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.876
I had nothing to do with that decision.

13:15.170 --> 13:19.508
But where I play a part in your life is
to make sure that you stay here.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.011
That you rehabilitate yourself...

13:23.554 --> 13:25.472
...become a model prisoner...

13:26.014 --> 13:27.683
...a better human being.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.811
That's my job, Henri.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.980
You too have a job.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.483
And trying to escape...

13:36.775 --> 13:40.362
...is not one of the duties
of your job description. Understand?

13:40.529 --> 13:41.864
In life...

13:44.408 --> 13:46.285
...for every action...

13:47.703 --> 13:51.540
...there is a definite and distinct reaction.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.293
Action...

13:59.047 --> 13:59.965
...reaction.

14:00.048 --> 14:03.260
- Yes, Mr. Glenn.
- Now, if you escape, action:

14:03.886 --> 14:05.888
I lose my job.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.724
Reaction: I have a family...

14:09.057 --> 14:11.894
...that I will not be able to provide for!

14:12.895 --> 14:14.521
I'm not done yet.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.733
Now, knowing this information...

14:17.900 --> 14:19.610
...can you tell me...

14:19.818 --> 14:23.071
...why you would possibly
want to escape...

14:23.614 --> 14:26.116
...and jeopardize my family?

14:33.457 --> 14:36.001
I've done nothing to you but my job.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.755
And instead of letting you learn...

14:39.963 --> 14:43.425
...by breaking the rules,
I feel I need to show you how to...

14:43.592 --> 14:44.801
...obey them.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.637
Tolerance.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.972
Tolerance for pain.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.267
My tolerance of you.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.646
But tolerance can be mistaken
for kindness.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.483
And kindness can be mistaken
for weakness.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.237
And we can't have weakness,
can we, Henri?

15:03.612 --> 15:06.156
I understand. I will be good.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.367
I'm not gonna try and run again.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.701
No, you won't.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.912
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.248
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.291
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.794
Action, reaction.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.005
Good.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.258
Good.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.012
Good.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.481
Clean him up, take him to the hole.

15:39.815 --> 15:43.277
<i>Christmas, 1939,
I celebrated visiting with my brother.</i>

15:44.194 --> 15:46.363
<i>Henri Young celebrated in Alcatraz.</i>

15:49.700 --> 15:51.618
<i>"Let nothing you dismay</i>

<i>"Oh, tidings of comfort and joy"</i>

16:25.027 --> 16:26.069
Stop it!

16:26.528 --> 16:27.779
Get in there!

16:27.863 --> 16:30.908
Please, no, no! Please, don't put me back!

16:31.408 --> 16:34.620
Please, don't put me back!

16:35.704 --> 16:38.665
I don't want to! I don't want to! No!

16:44.213 --> 16:45.756
They sound great.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.549
Merry Christmas.

16:50.260 --> 16:54.097
"Standing 'round a flagpole
And he caught himself a head cold"

16:54.973 --> 16:57.809
He sings it over and over.
I can't get him to shut up.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.311
It gets on your nerves.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.564
<i>In January of 1941,
I had passed the bar exam.</i>

17:03.607 --> 17:06.734
<i>Henri Young was in his third year
of rehabilitation.</i>

17:10.614 --> 17:12.907
<i>Welcome to Alcatraz, gentlemen.</i>

17:12.991 --> 17:14.867
<i>Step off the boat and onto the dock.</i>

17:17.746 --> 17:20.123
<i>Eyes straight ahead at all times.</i>

17:21.875 --> 17:24.086
<i>There was a boat
named after Warden Humson...</i>

17:24.211 --> 17:27.047
<i>...which handled the traffic
to and from Alcatraz.</i>

17:27.130 --> 17:32.010
<i>In the morning and afternoon, it shuttled
the children to San Francisco for classes.</i>

17:32.427 --> 17:35.639
<i>It was also used to transport prisoners
to the island.</i>

17:35.806 --> 17:38.600
<i>When possible, having children
and prisoners on the boat...</i>

17:38.684 --> 17:40.769
<i>...at the same time was avoided.</i>

17:42.437 --> 17:44.231
<i>Don't look at the children.</i>

17:45.440 --> 17:47.526
I'll take the kids to the city.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.111
We'll go shopping.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.780
Honey, can I call you back?

17:52.030 --> 17:53.448
The warden's here.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.119
Good morning, Warden.

17:57.161 --> 17:58.412
Good morning.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.708
- When did you arrive on the island?
- About 20 minutes ago.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.458
Good.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.043
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.463
Mr. Glenn...

18:08.630 --> 18:11.300
...I've been going over
the rotation figures...

18:12.134 --> 18:14.303
...in the solitary-confinement cells.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.305
Is there something wrong?

18:16.346 --> 18:19.349
Well, I don't know.
I don't think this can be right.

18:19.641 --> 18:20.809
What's that?

18:20.976 --> 18:22.644
Here, 244.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.149
According to this, he's been in there
since March of '38.

18:27.316 --> 18:31.445
I don't believe there's been
an attitude change with regard to 244.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.156
He's not like the other inmates.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.866
That's over three years!

18:35.949 --> 18:38.660
He masterminded
the escape attempt in '38.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.662
There hasn't been one since.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.500
<i>If you let those animals believe
that escape is possible...</i>

18:45.375 --> 18:48.337
<i>...you might as well stick in
a revolving door.</i>

18:48.545 --> 18:50.797
<i>I think he has learned his lesson.</i>

18:54.593 --> 18:56.637
Come on, Henri. Let's go.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.644
<i>Henri Young had been rehabilitated.</i>

19:03.727 --> 19:07.981
<i>I was now a public defender
in San Francisco. We'd meet in three days.</i>

19:08.774 --> 19:09.900
Eat, Young!

19:10.567 --> 19:14.029
You know the rules!
You don't eat, you go to solitary!

19:16.198 --> 19:17.533
Now, get with it!

19:19.952 --> 19:21.787
<i>Two times two is four.</i>

19:22.412 --> 19:24.039
<i>Two times three is six.</i>

19:24.373 --> 19:26.333
<i>Two times four is eight.</i>

19:26.959 --> 19:28.126
<i>Eight.</i>

19:28.585 --> 19:30.128
<i>Two times five...</i>

19:30.420 --> 19:31.255
<i>...ten.</i>

19:32.464 --> 19:33.799
<i>Twelve times...</i>

19:34.091 --> 19:35.217
<i>...eight...</i>

19:36.969 --> 19:38.220
<i>...ninety-six.</i>

19:42.349 --> 19:45.060
<i>Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe more-</i>

19:50.983 --> 19:53.610
Henri, McCain, he put you in the hole.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.404
Put you in the hole.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.573
McCain's still here. Look!

19:57.781 --> 20:00.534
<i>McCain put you in the hole!
Put you in the hole!</i>

20:00.909 --> 20:04.121
<i>McCain, he put you in the hole.
Put you in the hole!</i>

20:43.535 --> 20:45.037
Get them back!

20:45.537 --> 20:48.040
Get them back against the wall now!

20:48.207 --> 20:49.541
Do it now!

20:50.542 --> 20:51.793
What happened?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.420
I don't know.

21:27.913 --> 21:30.707
<i>The United States of America
vs. Henri Young.</i>

21:31.208 --> 21:33.418
<i>Charged with murder in the first degree.</i>

21:33.502 --> 21:34.670
<i>Approach the bench.</i>

21:36.213 --> 21:38.757
Charged with murder in the first degree.

21:40.384 --> 21:43.971
"Henri Young, Rufus McCain...
and there, striking and wounding...

21:44.054 --> 21:46.765
"...sharp steel instrument...
to wit, a spoon."

21:47.724 --> 21:49.393
No, this can't be right.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.395
It's right.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.688
If you say so.

21:52.855 --> 21:55.691
"To wit, a spoon
about four inches in length...

21:55.858 --> 21:59.027
"...which, striking and wounding,
described as foresaid...

21:59.111 --> 22:02.072
"...caused the said Rufus McCain
thereafter, to wit...

22:02.114 --> 22:05.159
"...on June 11, 1941 to die."

22:06.368 --> 22:09.204
Trial set one week from Thursday, June 22.

22:10.122 --> 22:11.790
This court stands adjourned.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.264
I know you can do it!

22:30.100 --> 22:31.268
Come on, boy!

22:31.393 --> 22:34.146
You can do it! You've got four furlongs!

22:34.313 --> 22:36.273
Don't be cursing this street!

22:36.398 --> 22:40.319
Pick them up and lay them down!
Let those legs pump like pistons!

22:40.485 --> 22:44.489
Yes! Come on! The spirit is willing!
I can see it in your eyes.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.533
Come on!

22:47.284 --> 22:48.577
Pump it! Go!

22:48.785 --> 22:51.246
Remember Jesse Owens
at the '36 Olympics?

22:53.123 --> 22:54.833
Maybe tomorrow, sonny boy!

23:19.358 --> 23:20.943
Watch it, buster!

23:40.337 --> 23:41.630
Sorry, Counselor!

23:42.089 --> 23:43.674
You're all right?

23:44.216 --> 23:45.717
Mary, I'm sorry.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.637
I'm sorry. Mary, you okay?

23:48.846 --> 23:50.973
- Stop that!
- Okay, I'm sorry!

23:51.056 --> 23:54.476
If Henkin saw us, he wouldn't think twice
about suspending us.

23:54.518 --> 23:55.978
- All right.
- Fix your tie.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.020
Why?

23:57.896 --> 23:59.982
You need to look good
when you thank Henkin.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.151
What do I want to thank Henkin for?
The man's a cretin.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.405
- He's given you a case.
- Case of what? Scotch?

24:06.655 --> 24:08.824
Yes, James, a case of Scotch.

24:08.991 --> 24:11.702
An actual case where I stand
in front of a jury?

24:12.369 --> 24:15.164
- Federal murder one, no less.
- Henri Young.

24:15.497 --> 24:19.418
He's a convict who killed another convict
in front of 200 witnesses.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.629
Was it self-defense?

24:22.754 --> 24:23.964
With a spoon.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.340
What with a spoon?

24:25.424 --> 24:28.677
That was the murder weapon.
He used a spoon to kill the man.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.221
Weren't any forks or knives available?

24:31.263 --> 24:33.223
My first case I can't possibly win.

24:33.265 --> 24:37.227
Do this one for the experience, for the next
time, when maybe your guy didn't do it.

24:37.311 --> 24:38.604
You could learn a lot.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.856
Go see your client
and make nice to Henkin.

24:40.898 --> 24:43.108
- I'll see you tonight?
- Maybe.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.614
Thank you for your confidence in me
in getting this case.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.867
I don't have any confidence in you.
The guy is guilty.

24:52.034 --> 24:55.329
A monkey could try this case
and not make it any worse.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.247
- I see.
- Remember that.

24:57.456 --> 24:59.208
- Thank you, sir.
- A monkey.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.045
I guess I'm a monkey.

25:22.481 --> 25:26.235
- James Stamphill to see Henri Young.
- I need you to sign the release.

25:29.821 --> 25:32.074
- It's a nice day.
- Yeah, great.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.148
Where are you going?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.942
To the cell, talk to my client.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.443
What, are you nuts?

26:08.527 --> 26:10.737
I want to speak to him face to face.

26:11.905 --> 26:12.906
Well...

26:15.117 --> 26:17.244
You've already signed the release.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.126
It's your life.

26:28.881 --> 26:29.882
Hi.

26:31.049 --> 26:33.135
So, then, Mr. Young, is it?

26:35.387 --> 26:37.556
You're Mr. Young, is that correct?

26:39.391 --> 26:41.560
Mr. Young, that is your name, isn't it?

26:41.643 --> 26:42.811
Henri Young?

26:45.522 --> 26:49.401
I'll just assume that's your name
until you tell me differently.

26:49.818 --> 26:52.654
Mr. Young, I will be acting
as your defense attorney.

26:52.738 --> 26:55.324
I'm James Stamphill
and anything you tell me...

26:55.407 --> 26:59.036
...will be protected under the rules
of confidentiality...

26:59.161 --> 27:02.331
...of the attorney-client relationship.
So feel completely free...

27:02.372 --> 27:05.667
...to answer my questions
in an honest and forthright fashion.

27:05.751 --> 27:09.046
Just for the record,
your name is Henri Young, right?

27:13.383 --> 27:16.720
This isn't an admission of guilt.
It's just your name.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.932
You speak English?

27:21.850 --> 27:25.437
Yeah, you do speak English.
It says so right here in the file.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.362
Mr. Young...

27:34.988 --> 27:39.701
...I am your attorney but I can't provide you
with much of a defense if one of us is...

27:40.202 --> 27:41.411
...catatonic.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.539
You see...

27:43.914 --> 27:47.876
...we both have to be able and willing
to answer when our name is called.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.048
Can you hear?

28:10.607 --> 28:11.817
Mr. Young?

28:13.819 --> 28:15.404
You okay, Mr. Young?

28:15.529 --> 28:18.240
<i>Henri Young was born in Kansas in 1913.</i>

28:19.825 --> 28:22.161
<i>His parents died ten years later...</i>

28:22.244 --> 28:24.538
<i>...leaving Henri to raise his younger sister.</i>

28:25.789 --> 28:29.501
<i>At the age of 17, Henri went into
a local store to try to get a job.</i>

28:31.295 --> 28:33.046
<i>He was refused work.</i>

28:34.423 --> 28:38.302
<i>Out of desperation he reached
into the cash register and took $5.</i>

28:39.636 --> 28:42.723
<i>The store also doubled
as the town's post office.</i>

28:44.141 --> 28:48.061
<i>Henri was tried and convicted
of the federal crime of mail robbery.</i>

28:49.688 --> 28:52.608
<i>Henri's sister was taken
to live in an orphanage.</i>

28:54.484 --> 28:56.403
<i>He would never see her again.</i>

28:58.071 --> 29:00.991
<i>Eleven years later,
Henri would kill Rufus McCain.</i>

29:28.227 --> 29:29.520
Mr. Young...

29:29.937 --> 29:31.939
...you killed a guy, so...

29:32.523 --> 29:34.399
...you're not catatonic.

29:36.693 --> 29:38.695
I know that you can talk.

29:39.696 --> 29:41.156
I don't know...

29:42.157 --> 29:44.576
...maybe you could write something.

29:47.204 --> 29:49.748
You want to write something? Write here.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.545
Something. Just...

29:55.587 --> 29:57.673
Look, you want to give it a try?

29:57.840 --> 29:59.424
You want to write?

30:03.929 --> 30:05.264
Something...

30:05.430 --> 30:06.682
...please.

30:08.725 --> 30:10.936
Mr. Young, you're looking at me.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.105
You hear me, don't you?

30:15.607 --> 30:19.361
If you won't answer my questions,
maybe we can start with something else.

30:19.403 --> 30:22.197
What do you want?
There has to be something.

30:22.239 --> 30:26.285
Can't be to sit there, because if you do,
they'll just stick you in the gas chamber.

30:26.368 --> 30:28.036
Do you understand that?

30:41.300 --> 30:42.301
Look...

30:44.386 --> 30:46.513
...Mr. Young, I've read your file.

30:47.931 --> 30:49.933
I am trying to help you.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.687
That's all I'm trying to do.
I just want to help you.

30:54.313 --> 30:55.731
Maybe there are...

30:56.273 --> 30:58.901
...extenuating circumstances in your case.

31:00.944 --> 31:03.697
Getting sentenced to Leavenworth
for stealing...

31:03.822 --> 31:05.782
...$500, that's extenuating.

31:10.913 --> 31:13.499
You have to understand, I'm on your side.

31:13.790 --> 31:14.583
$5.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.001
What, Mr. Young?

31:18.086 --> 31:20.005
It was $5, not $500.

31:21.131 --> 31:25.010
I knew you had it in you. Now, come on.
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

31:25.969 --> 31:28.472
You just talked. Don't do this again.

31:29.139 --> 31:32.351
Come on, don't quit now.
Come on, you just talked!

31:32.851 --> 31:34.520
Why did you kill McCain?

31:40.817 --> 31:41.777
What?

31:42.694 --> 31:44.530
- What are you saying?
- How...

31:44.613 --> 31:46.156
How? How? How?

31:46.949 --> 31:48.367
Are you saying "how"?

31:48.450 --> 31:49.493
How.

31:50.077 --> 31:51.078
How?

31:51.703 --> 31:52.788
How.

31:54.206 --> 31:58.168
How. What are you, a fucking Indian?
Don't quit now. How what?

31:58.293 --> 31:59.127
How is...

31:59.169 --> 32:02.840
You want to know how somebody is?
I'll find out immediately.

32:03.215 --> 32:04.299
How is...

32:04.842 --> 32:05.634
Who?

32:05.717 --> 32:06.969
DiMaggio.

32:07.344 --> 32:08.929
How is DiMaggio?

32:09.346 --> 32:11.473
Is he a prisoner over at Alcatraz?

32:12.057 --> 32:13.141
How is...

32:13.350 --> 32:14.643
...DiMaggio...

32:14.852 --> 32:16.311
...doing this year?

32:18.063 --> 32:20.315
DiMaggio, the baseball player?

32:20.858 --> 32:21.817
Yeah.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.906
How is Joe DiMaggio, the baseball player,
doing? That's what you're asking?

32:34.955 --> 32:36.331
Mr. Young...

32:39.918 --> 32:41.795
...I don't really follow baseball.

32:43.255 --> 32:44.339
You know.

32:54.558 --> 32:57.227
<i>Excuse me, Mr. McNeil,
I'm James Stamphill.</i>

32:58.395 --> 33:00.355
- Counsel for Henri Young.
- Yes.

33:00.397 --> 33:03.400
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about continuance?

33:03.442 --> 33:04.401
No.

33:04.526 --> 33:07.321
You don't understand.
He just sits there and won't speak.

33:07.404 --> 33:11.366
Maybe he's practicing for the gas chamber.
Tell him to take deep breaths.

33:11.450 --> 33:15.204
You won't even consider a joint motion
in the interest of justice?

33:15.621 --> 33:18.582
- Are you old enough to be a lawyer?
- Yes, sir, I am.

33:18.624 --> 33:21.043
No joint motion for a continuance.

33:21.210 --> 33:24.254
No psychiatrist.
And trust me, pal, no plea bargain.

33:24.421 --> 33:26.089
Your boy's gonna suck the pipe.

33:26.632 --> 33:30.219
I don't know who you pissed off
to get this shit case and I don't care.

33:30.302 --> 33:31.303
No breaks.

33:41.438 --> 33:44.233
Mr. Young, DiMaggio is having
a great year.

33:44.441 --> 33:47.986
Last year he was the American League
batting champ with a .352 average...

33:48.070 --> 33:52.324
...which was just a bit off the year before
when he had a .381 average.

33:52.491 --> 33:54.827
The Yankees, they too had a good year.

33:55.285 --> 33:57.454
New York defeated Chicago 4-0...

33:58.163 --> 34:00.916
...led by jolting Joe DiMaggio hitting 400.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.961
400, that's pretty good, isn't it?

34:05.838 --> 34:07.589
June 17, 1941...

34:08.257 --> 34:11.717
...our friend DiMaggio hits safely
in 32 straight games.

34:12.261 --> 34:15.514
Twelve more and he will tie
Wee Willie Keeler's all-time record...

34:15.597 --> 34:18.934
...who set the mark in 1897
for the Baltimore Orioles.

34:19.268 --> 34:23.688
Joe Louis was the victor in what some
consider the toughest win of his career.

34:30.154 --> 34:32.781
Here we go.
Here's some entertainment news.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.116
Betty Grable.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.284
See?

34:37.870 --> 34:39.663
Says here she's just-

34:40.789 --> 34:41.956
How old are you?

34:42.040 --> 34:43.417
What, Mr. Young?

34:44.501 --> 34:45.960
How old are you?

34:47.545 --> 34:48.922
I'm 24.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.136
I think...

34:54.887 --> 34:56.221
...I am too.

34:59.057 --> 35:00.267
No, you're...

35:01.310 --> 35:02.769
...you're 28.

35:17.159 --> 35:19.912
Would you like me to keep reading to you?

35:29.254 --> 35:32.382
This ought to make you
a little bit more comfortable.

35:47.898 --> 35:51.860
The defense requests a new jury.
Having been eliminated from this process-

35:51.944 --> 35:53.362
Three new members.

35:53.445 --> 35:54.780
And that's it.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.281
Next.

35:57.491 --> 36:00.452
The defense requests a continuance
of 60 days...

36:00.536 --> 36:02.371
...so I may confer with my client-

36:02.621 --> 36:04.581
He doesn't need 60 days.

36:04.873 --> 36:07.876
The facts in this case are so clear,
six minutes should do it.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.254
My client has been almost catatonic.

36:10.379 --> 36:13.215
- Yesterday was the first day-
- He wasn't so catatonic...

36:13.298 --> 36:17.636
...that he couldn't walk over and slit
a guy's throat in front of 200 witnesses.

36:18.470 --> 36:21.932
Is it your contention
that the defendant is insane?

36:22.140 --> 36:24.560
Is that what you mean by "catatonic"?

36:25.894 --> 36:27.855
Approach the bench, Counselor.

36:30.816 --> 36:32.568
Is this laying the groundwork...

36:32.609 --> 36:35.320
...for a not-guilty by reason
of insanity plea?

36:35.988 --> 36:39.491
I don't know yet. I haven't even spoken
to him about the case-

36:40.075 --> 36:41.660
One week, Counselor.

36:41.743 --> 36:45.164
Then you will either tell me
you are ready for the trial...

36:45.330 --> 36:49.334
...or you will come in here with a request
for a competency hearing.

36:49.501 --> 36:50.752
One week.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.965
This court is in recess.

37:10.856 --> 37:13.525
Mr. Young, you and me,
we've got to talk now.

37:14.193 --> 37:16.069
Would you like a cigarette?

37:16.153 --> 37:17.488
No, thanks.

37:17.863 --> 37:19.615
That shit will kill you.

37:21.033 --> 37:22.117
That's...

37:22.284 --> 37:23.702
...kind of funny.

37:24.369 --> 37:26.079
"That shit'll kill you."

37:26.455 --> 37:29.875
I'll die in that gas chamber anyway,
so that's kind of a joke.

37:30.042 --> 37:32.544
What's this about Nazis? We at war?

37:32.836 --> 37:34.713
No, not yet, Mr. Young.

37:35.047 --> 37:36.381
- It's brand new.
- What?

37:36.465 --> 37:38.634
- Mr. Glenn told me.
- The associate warden?

37:38.717 --> 37:42.304
He says it's brand new.
He said they're gonna try it out on me.

37:46.475 --> 37:47.434
No.

37:49.311 --> 37:51.063
You only have a week.

37:51.396 --> 37:53.565
You've got to talk to me. Okay?

37:54.316 --> 37:56.276
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

37:57.986 --> 38:00.197
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

38:04.243 --> 38:06.829
How could you not know about baseball?

38:09.081 --> 38:11.416
You said, "I don't follow baseball."

38:11.500 --> 38:13.502
- How could you not?
- Why'd you kill him?

38:13.585 --> 38:17.172
Over and over, it must have been
maybe a year, I don't know.

38:17.256 --> 38:19.258
All I did was hear them in my head.

38:19.341 --> 38:22.678
What are you talking about?
Are you talking about McCain?

38:22.845 --> 38:26.306
I'm talking about baseball.
The great American pastime.

38:26.765 --> 38:29.768
I went over every game
I ever heard on the radio.

38:30.435 --> 38:34.523
I went over every game I ever heard.
Just playing them over in my head.

38:36.275 --> 38:38.277
You had all those games to go to...

38:38.360 --> 38:40.445
...and you didn't even care.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.614
I'm talking about Rufus McCain.

38:42.739 --> 38:46.368
I'm talking about three fucking years
they had me in that bucket!

38:46.702 --> 38:48.287
Three fucking years!

38:48.537 --> 38:52.499
Without any fucking light!
You had all those games to listen to!

38:53.625 --> 38:56.712
You didn't even know
what DiMaggio hit this year.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.549
What kind of asshole are you?

39:02.134 --> 39:03.635
Calm down, boy!

39:06.096 --> 39:09.391
You know the average length of time
an inmate would be in solitary?

39:09.474 --> 39:10.559
Nineteen days.

39:11.059 --> 39:13.187
I understand, but he killed a man.

39:13.270 --> 39:16.273
Henry did three years in total darkness.
In a black hole.

39:16.356 --> 39:19.985
That's tragic, but he took a life.
Your brother will tell you what I did.

39:20.068 --> 39:22.905
- You won't get him off.
- He's the best lawyer I know.

39:22.988 --> 39:27.075
He can tell me if we've got a chance
for some kind of insanity plea.

39:27.159 --> 39:29.119
Your brother won't give a damn.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.205
<i>Your client is a two-time loser.</i>

39:31.371 --> 39:35.000
This case is much more
about you than him.

39:35.626 --> 39:37.211
He has no future.

39:37.794 --> 39:41.381
This is your first time in the spotlight.
It's what you worked for.

39:41.673 --> 39:43.800
This case is a lost cause...

39:44.051 --> 39:46.929
...so you must handle it like a lost cause.

39:53.810 --> 39:57.314
Maybe you're right,
but the guy's not exactly Al Capone.

39:57.981 --> 39:59.274
No, he isn't.

40:00.275 --> 40:03.654
All they had him on was
income tax evasion. Your boy...

40:04.655 --> 40:06.448
...they got on murder one.

40:07.407 --> 40:08.200
Hi.

40:08.325 --> 40:09.451
How are you?

40:10.160 --> 40:11.245
Hi, Henri.

40:11.411 --> 40:12.579
Listen.

40:12.788 --> 40:15.833
You're not mad at me
for blowing up at you yesterday?

40:15.916 --> 40:17.459
Nobody talks back.

40:17.543 --> 40:19.127
No, I'm not mad at you.

40:19.294 --> 40:20.671
I'll get the hang of it.

40:20.754 --> 40:22.256
I got a sense of humor.

40:22.339 --> 40:24.925
We gonna have some good times
before this is through.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.678
You know how to play cards?
Could you get some?

40:28.178 --> 40:29.930
I set this up for you. Sit down.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.850
How much light got into the cell
you spent three years in?

40:32.933 --> 40:36.395
- Like when you offered me a cigarette.
- I want to get that straight.

40:36.478 --> 40:37.855
That was pretty good, huh?

40:38.522 --> 40:40.941
You gotta help me if I'm going
to defend you now.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.651
Yeah, sure, sure.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.445
Have a look here.

40:47.364 --> 40:50.117
Did you kill this man here? Rufus McCain?

40:51.618 --> 40:53.453
I must have. I'm here.

40:53.912 --> 40:56.832
I don't remember it,
but everybody saw me, so, yeah.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.209
- But you don't remember it?
- No. So what?

40:59.293 --> 41:00.544
Did you want to?

41:00.627 --> 41:03.714
Once there was this spider
that crawled over me.

41:03.964 --> 41:05.507
It was like having company.

41:05.591 --> 41:08.552
I looked for him again, couldn't find him.
He had a way out.

41:08.635 --> 41:10.888
McCain landed you in the bucket, right?

41:10.971 --> 41:13.140
142 times 93. Ask me that one.

41:13.223 --> 41:16.518
- How long after you came out-
-13,206.

41:17.394 --> 41:20.355
13,000? You mean, days?
What are you talking about?

41:20.564 --> 41:23.150
No, that's the answer. 142 times 93.

41:23.233 --> 41:26.278
- Concentrate on what I'm saying!
- I know what you're saying.

41:26.361 --> 41:29.573
- How long was it?
- I don't know! I don't remember!

41:30.657 --> 41:33.494
Who's the new girl I've seen in the papers?
Ingrid Berger?

41:33.577 --> 41:35.871
She's a looker. You seen her movies?

41:36.079 --> 41:37.498
I want you to think!

41:37.581 --> 41:39.166
I don't want to think!

41:39.291 --> 41:42.127
I spent three goddamn years in the dark...

41:42.419 --> 41:44.546
...smelling my own shit and piss...

41:44.755 --> 41:46.507
...doing nothing but thinking!

41:46.590 --> 41:48.050
I hate thinking!

41:54.973 --> 41:56.600
I'm sorry, Henri.

42:02.105 --> 42:03.398
I'm sorry.

42:04.858 --> 42:06.735
I'm just trying to help you.

42:08.111 --> 42:09.571
You got a girl, right?

42:11.031 --> 42:12.533
Take your jacket off.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.743
- What?
- Let me smell it.

42:15.202 --> 42:17.538
You were easier to understand catatonic.

42:17.621 --> 42:18.914
What's she like?

42:18.956 --> 42:20.833
- Who?
- Your girl. That's perfume.

42:20.916 --> 42:22.584
Let me smell your jacket.

42:24.795 --> 42:26.296
I'll make you a deal.

42:26.380 --> 42:29.800
I'll give my jacket, my pants,
whatever you want. Sports, girls...

42:29.883 --> 42:32.970
But you gotta tell me just one memory
about something I ask.

42:33.303 --> 42:34.388
Deal?

42:34.888 --> 42:35.931
Sure.

42:44.147 --> 42:45.941
I've never been with a girl.

42:53.407 --> 42:54.908
Let me try it on.

42:55.993 --> 42:58.453
How long was it you went
without any daylight?

42:58.537 --> 43:01.290
<i>Did they ever let you out for any exercise?</i>

43:01.665 --> 43:03.959
- Merry Christmas.
- Please, don't hit me.

43:04.168 --> 43:06.920
- Get the tear gas.
- How long I been in here?

43:07.087 --> 43:09.965
- You're out of the hole.
- I made it! I did it!

43:10.174 --> 43:11.758
It's Christmas, 1940.

43:11.925 --> 43:13.969
You've been down there two years.

43:15.262 --> 43:16.471
Two years!

43:17.264 --> 43:18.473
I did it.

43:19.850 --> 43:21.310
Two fucking years.

43:22.269 --> 43:24.271
I made it. I made it.

43:25.105 --> 43:26.857
I'm not too crazy, am I?

43:27.691 --> 43:29.485
I did it! It's over!

43:29.860 --> 43:31.570
Nothing's over, Henri.

43:31.653 --> 43:34.198
Thirty minutes exercise, that's all you get.

43:35.199 --> 43:36.200
No!

43:40.704 --> 43:42.706
You don't want it, we take you back.

43:42.748 --> 43:43.790
No!

43:44.166 --> 43:45.209
I want it!

43:45.375 --> 43:46.710
I want it.

43:48.212 --> 43:50.506
I'll be good. I'll be good.

43:59.056 --> 44:01.350
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:</i>

44:01.683 --> 44:03.644
<i>The defendant, Henri Young...</i>

44:03.727 --> 44:06.688
<i>...is accused of murder in the first degree.</i>

44:07.147 --> 44:10.776
<i>It is your responsibility,
as a juror, to deal with truth.</i>

44:11.735 --> 44:13.362
<i>Rufus McCain was murdered...</i>

44:14.488 --> 44:16.156
<i>...by Henri Young.</i>

44:16.240 --> 44:17.825
<i>Mr. Stamphill...</i>

44:18.200 --> 44:19.535
<i>...public defender...</i>

44:19.576 --> 44:23.580
<i>...will play upon your sympathies.
He'll use every trick in the book.</i>

44:23.664 --> 44:24.706
<i>Why?</i>

44:25.582 --> 44:27.417
<i>To avoid the gas chamber.</i>

44:28.001 --> 44:30.504
<i>The United States of America
will demand...</i>

44:30.671 --> 44:33.090
<i>...that you return a verdict of guilty...</i>

44:33.173 --> 44:34.842
<i>...so that this...</i>

44:35.175 --> 44:36.760
<i>...this animal...</i>

44:36.927 --> 44:40.097
<i>...will receive the punishment
commanded by the Bible.</i>

44:40.430 --> 44:42.057
<i>"An eye for an eye."</i>

44:42.933 --> 44:44.560
<i>A life for a life.</i>

44:44.643 --> 44:47.646
<i>For if ever there was a man
guilty of murder...</i>

44:49.106 --> 44:50.691
...it is Henri Young.

44:51.859 --> 44:55.112
And if ever a man deserved
to die for that crime...

44:56.363 --> 44:58.157
...it is the accused.

45:01.994 --> 45:04.329
Thank you very much, Mr. McNeil.

45:07.124 --> 45:11.003
Mr. Stamphill, are you prepared
to make your opening statement?

45:11.712 --> 45:12.921
Your Honor...

45:13.213 --> 45:15.424
...ladies and gentlemen of the jury:

45:16.884 --> 45:20.762
When I was a kid, my heroes
weren't Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig...

45:21.305 --> 45:23.473
...they were Clarence Darrow
and Emile Zola.

45:23.557 --> 45:26.476
In other words, I have waited
for this moment all my life.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.730
To stand, like I am, in front of a jury
of 12 good people...

45:29.813 --> 45:33.484
...to plead the case of an innocent man
who's been unjustly accused.

45:33.567 --> 45:35.569
The only problem is he did it.

45:36.236 --> 45:39.072
I know it, the prosecutor, Mr. McNeil,
knows it.

45:39.239 --> 45:43.619
Henri doesn't know it 'cause he can't
remember it, but he won't deny he did it.

45:43.702 --> 45:47.080
All those witnesses the prosecutor
will bring forth will tell you...

45:47.164 --> 45:49.583
...Henri Young killed Rufus McCain.

45:50.667 --> 45:54.087
Now that we all know that,
why don't we find the man guilty...

45:54.171 --> 45:57.424
...and gas him because that's
what we all know is going to happen?

45:57.508 --> 45:58.675
Right, Henri?

45:58.759 --> 45:59.760
What?

46:01.053 --> 46:05.557
There's only one problem that'll keep us
from wrapping this up in record time.

46:05.849 --> 46:09.686
Henri Young did not act alone.
They haven't caught all the killers.

46:09.770 --> 46:14.525
There was a co-conspirator. Because of
this co-conspirator, whom we shall name...

46:14.775 --> 46:17.611
...Henri Young is innocent
of the crime of murder.

46:17.694 --> 46:18.779
What?

46:18.862 --> 46:21.323
Objection, Your Honor! I must protest!

46:21.448 --> 46:22.950
I figured you would.

46:23.033 --> 46:24.701
This is absurd.

46:25.035 --> 46:29.039
Before the counselor is allowed to waste
this court's time and this jury's time...

46:29.122 --> 46:33.710
...I'd request that he supply some proof
or evidence of this co-conspirator.

46:34.044 --> 46:38.173
Can you bring forward evidence
of the existence of a co-conspirator?

46:38.549 --> 46:42.553
Not at this time, but it is my intention
to do so during the course of the trial.

46:42.636 --> 46:46.431
He's not going to provide such proof
because no proof exists.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.852
This man spent three years
in solitary confinement...

46:50.060 --> 46:53.021
...during which time no one had
any influence over him...

46:53.063 --> 46:55.732
...because no one had
any contact with him.

46:56.316 --> 46:59.319
He came out of solitary.
He went directly to a shower.

46:59.403 --> 47:03.740
Then he went directly to a haircut.
Then he went directly to the dining hall...

47:03.824 --> 47:06.827
...where one convict had said
one sentence to him.

47:06.994 --> 47:09.496
This does not a co-conspirator make.

47:09.663 --> 47:12.541
I'm inclined to agree with the prosecution.

47:13.167 --> 47:15.502
Unless you can justify
that line of defense...

47:15.586 --> 47:18.338
...I will sustain the prosecution's objection.

47:18.505 --> 47:22.551
The district attorney, with his own words,
has just made my case for me.

47:22.759 --> 47:24.219
That'll be the day.

47:24.845 --> 47:26.054
Your Honor...

47:26.763 --> 47:29.892
...for three years,
three long, tortuous years...

47:30.267 --> 47:33.937
...no one and nothing had any influence
whatsoever over Henri Young.

47:34.188 --> 47:35.731
No one and nothing.

47:35.939 --> 47:39.735
This was a man whose only crime was
to steal $5 from a local post office...

47:39.776 --> 47:41.778
...to feed his starving sister.

47:41.862 --> 47:45.574
He came to Alcatraz a petty criminal
who had never harmed...

47:45.657 --> 47:48.494
...or attempted to harm
another human being in his life.

47:48.577 --> 47:52.164
He came out of the dungeon a vicious,
barbaric, maniacal murderer.

47:52.539 --> 47:55.042
A man who had been put
into a psychological coma.

47:55.125 --> 47:57.628
Within an hour of coming out
of that hell hole...

47:57.711 --> 48:01.048
...he did what would've been unthinkable
to him three years before.

48:01.131 --> 48:02.382
Unthinkable!

48:02.549 --> 48:05.886
His only thought was murder!
His only instinct was murder.

48:06.053 --> 48:07.763
His first act was murder!

48:07.888 --> 48:11.558
He himself was a murder weapon,
but the hand that held that weapon...

48:11.642 --> 48:15.229
...and plunged it into the throat of McCain
belonged to someone else.

48:15.312 --> 48:17.564
I point to Associate Warden, Mr. Glenn...

48:17.648 --> 48:21.777
...Warden Humson and the institution
known as Alcatraz and say, "I accuse! "

48:21.985 --> 48:24.988
- Objection!
- I accuse them individually and collectively.

48:25.072 --> 48:28.325
I accuse Alcatraz of the torture
of Henri Young!

48:28.659 --> 48:31.578
- I accuse Alcatraz of McCain's murder!
- Come to order!

48:31.662 --> 48:34.373
Silence! This court will come to order!

48:37.334 --> 48:40.420
Henri Young is not going to be
the only defendant here!

48:40.587 --> 48:42.256
Alcatraz is on trial!

48:42.506 --> 48:45.259
<i>I will address your objection
tomorrow morning!</i>

48:45.759 --> 48:50.097
<i>Henri Young, on trial for his life, is seen
leaving the San Francisco courthouse...</i>

48:50.180 --> 48:54.434
<i>...followed by his young and now very
popular public defender, James Stamphill.</i>

48:54.518 --> 48:58.647
<i>Stamphill has accused the infamous Rock
of torture, using the tag line...</i>

48:58.856 --> 49:00.691
<i>..."crimes against humanity."</i>

49:00.774 --> 49:04.111
<i>He has turned the once quiet trial
of a convict killing...</i>

49:04.236 --> 49:06.155
<i>...into a media circus.</i>

49:06.363 --> 49:08.782
In most cases, they do get better.

49:10.534 --> 49:12.536
In the case of Henri Young...

49:13.370 --> 49:15.539
...this happens not to be true.

49:15.831 --> 49:17.040
Young is a...

49:17.374 --> 49:18.584
...noisemaker.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.962
Some prisoners have a problem
when they're in...

49:23.213 --> 49:24.423
...solitary.

49:25.007 --> 49:28.177
All we do is try to discourage misconduct.

49:29.636 --> 49:32.973
<i>This is the first verbal attack
on the jewel of the prison system.</i>

49:33.056 --> 49:37.060
<i>This bastion that houses evil
opened in 1934.</i>

49:37.644 --> 49:39.688
<i>It brought gangsters like Capone...</i>

49:39.771 --> 49:44.526
<i>...Machine Gun Kelly and Henri Young
close to the magical city by the bay...</i>

49:44.902 --> 49:48.530
<i>...less than one half-mile
from the world-famous Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

49:48.739 --> 49:51.533
<i>We went to the streets
to find out public opinion.</i>

49:51.658 --> 49:54.703
You can't put a place on trial.
It's a prison for prisoners.

49:54.786 --> 49:58.457
Now the murderers are accusing
the wardens of this and that.

49:58.540 --> 50:00.125
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

50:00.209 --> 50:02.336
Humson seems like a good guy.

50:02.419 --> 50:04.671
If Alcatraz wasn't here I wouldn't live here.

50:04.755 --> 50:07.549
- You think it's too close?
- I think it's perfect.

50:07.674 --> 50:09.676
He's innocent until proven guilty.

50:09.760 --> 50:13.013
He'll get a fair trial, but, nonetheless,
he's a murderer.

50:13.263 --> 50:15.724
<i>This grizzly evidence bears mute witness...</i>

50:15.766 --> 50:18.977
<i>...to the brutal crime
perpetrated by Henri Young.</i>

50:19.520 --> 50:21.021
<i>Note the spoon.</i>

50:21.522 --> 50:23.565
<i>Can a prison be put on trial?</i>

50:23.649 --> 50:26.568
<i>Judge Clawson's ruling tomorrow
may clear the way...</i>

50:26.652 --> 50:28.779
<i>...to put Alcatraz on trial.</i>

50:29.112 --> 50:32.866
"The warden can be relied upon
to carry out the instructions...

50:33.033 --> 50:35.744
"...of the Bureau, that no brutality...

50:36.411 --> 50:38.747
"...or inhumanity shall be practiced.

50:39.122 --> 50:42.334
"Sustained food and medical attention
shall be given."

50:42.459 --> 50:45.754
We have wholeheartedly followed
those instructions.

50:46.046 --> 50:47.089
Thank you.

50:47.381 --> 50:49.591
<i>So many opinions being expressed.</i>

50:49.800 --> 50:53.053
<i>We attempted to get a statement
from the recent Harvard graduate...</i>

50:53.136 --> 50:55.556
<i>...assigned to defend Henri Young.</i>

50:55.973 --> 50:59.184
Why don't we keep the trial
in the courtroom? Thank you.

51:00.310 --> 51:03.939
I would like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

51:04.064 --> 51:06.733
Mr. Stamphill, you are hereby
put on notice...

51:06.900 --> 51:09.903
...that this court has no interest
in newspaper headlines...

51:09.987 --> 51:12.114
...and will not be swayed by them.

51:12.865 --> 51:17.703
I further admonish that counsel's attempts
to try this case in the press...

51:17.828 --> 51:21.582
...and not before this court,
will put him in the utmost peril.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.669
Is that clear, Mr. Stamphill?

51:25.919 --> 51:27.296
Yes, Your Honor.

51:27.671 --> 51:28.755
Good.

51:29.381 --> 51:31.300
Bailiff, approach the bench.

51:31.758 --> 51:35.304
Before I hand down my ruling
on Mr. McNeil's objection...

51:35.804 --> 51:39.433
...I'd like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

51:39.516 --> 51:43.770
While I cannot give legal advice
and sit on the bench at the same time...

51:43.937 --> 51:47.649
...I will express grave concern
with the defense's strategy.

51:48.609 --> 51:51.778
Counselor, I strongly recommend
you walk a straight line...

51:51.862 --> 51:53.614
...in terms of your defense.

51:53.697 --> 51:58.285
Anything you state in this courtroom
will be evaluated not only by the jury...

51:58.452 --> 52:02.664
...but very closely scrutinized by myself.
Is that understood, Mr. Stamphill?

52:03.207 --> 52:04.333
Yes, Your Honor.

52:04.750 --> 52:05.918
Very well.

52:07.544 --> 52:09.630
Prosecution's objection is overruled.

52:10.547 --> 52:13.175
You may pursue your line of defense...

52:13.383 --> 52:15.636
...concerning the penitentiary at Alcatraz...

52:15.719 --> 52:19.306
...and I will rule on any objections
on a point-by-point basis.

52:19.473 --> 52:20.682
Exception.

52:20.849 --> 52:21.892
Noted.

52:21.975 --> 52:24.520
Mr. McNeil, you may call
your first witness.

52:24.728 --> 52:27.189
Prosecution calls Terrence Swenson.

52:28.649 --> 52:29.983
Terrence Swenson.

52:39.076 --> 52:42.079
Witness shall remain standing
until sworn in.

52:43.413 --> 52:45.165
Put your hand on the Bible.

52:45.249 --> 52:46.500
Cut it out.

52:46.583 --> 52:49.545
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth...

52:50.003 --> 52:51.505
...so help you God?

52:51.630 --> 52:52.965
So help me God.

52:53.090 --> 52:54.508
You may be seated.

52:55.509 --> 52:59.721
Mr. Swenson, as a guard at Alcatraz,
did you know Henri Young?

53:00.264 --> 53:01.014
Yes, sir.

53:01.098 --> 53:03.392
Could you point him out for us?

53:04.601 --> 53:06.687
That's him right over there, sir.

53:07.146 --> 53:08.814
Thank you, Mr. Whitney.

53:09.439 --> 53:10.315
Thank you.

53:10.399 --> 53:13.735
Now, on the morning of June 11, 1941,
where were you?

53:14.361 --> 53:16.738
I was on duty in the dining hall.

53:17.114 --> 53:18.699
Everything was normal.

53:19.032 --> 53:20.951
And I saw the defendant-

53:21.118 --> 53:22.202
Henri Young.

53:22.286 --> 53:23.579
That's correct.

53:23.954 --> 53:26.206
I saw him standing over Rufus McCain.

53:26.456 --> 53:28.542
He lifted up his chin and...

53:29.126 --> 53:31.253
- Excuse me, I'm nervous.
- It's all right.

53:31.295 --> 53:33.797
And he plunged a metal object...

53:34.715 --> 53:36.884
...which I later learned was a spoon...

53:36.967 --> 53:38.635
...into McCain's throat.

53:39.386 --> 53:41.221
He then ripped it open.

53:42.639 --> 53:45.058
Did the defendant ever appear
to be ranting...

53:45.142 --> 53:46.101
...or raving?

53:46.185 --> 53:47.352
No, sir.

53:47.478 --> 53:50.063
Mr. McKeon, was he frothing
at the mouth?

53:50.355 --> 53:51.273
No, sir.

53:51.899 --> 53:55.402
Did he in any way give the impression
of one who was insane?

53:55.652 --> 53:58.780
Objection. This man is not
a qualified psychiatrist.

53:58.864 --> 53:59.948
Sustained.

54:00.157 --> 54:04.119
So, it appeared to you that it was a cool,
calculated and deliberate act?

54:04.495 --> 54:06.246
- Objection!
- Overruled.

54:06.413 --> 54:08.790
The witness may answer the question.

54:08.874 --> 54:12.044
Yes, sir. Young did it,
just as cool as a cucumber.

54:12.294 --> 54:13.462
Thank you.

54:13.670 --> 54:15.047
No further questions.

54:15.506 --> 54:18.467
This court will reconvene
after the holiday...

54:18.509 --> 54:20.177
...9:00 a. m., July 5.

54:20.344 --> 54:21.470
All rise.

54:21.512 --> 54:23.847
You should have played cards with me.

54:24.431 --> 54:25.682
Alcatraz.

54:26.183 --> 54:29.144
It was built by the military
during the Civil War.

54:30.270 --> 54:33.649
In May of '33, the War Department
abandoned the island.

54:34.691 --> 54:38.946
It was leveled, all except for the lower
floor which is now used for storage.

54:39.279 --> 54:42.366
Note to myself:
Get access to the lower level...

54:42.491 --> 54:45.744
...because that's where the dungeons have
gotta be located.

54:45.828 --> 54:48.497
The only guard on record to be fired...

54:48.580 --> 54:52.251
...or dismissed during Henri's solitary time
was Derek Simpson.

54:52.751 --> 54:54.294
Locate Simpson.

54:54.545 --> 54:57.881
The prison opened in June of '34
under Warden Humson.

54:58.799 --> 55:01.718
He insisted on a high level
of guards to prisoners.

55:01.802 --> 55:03.804
Glenn was the first appointee.

55:05.556 --> 55:06.682
Mr. Henkin.

55:06.974 --> 55:09.476
Two things: First of all, you work for me.

55:09.643 --> 55:11.145
Let me finish!

55:12.229 --> 55:15.816
You work for me, which means
when I call you, you drop everything.

55:15.858 --> 55:18.610
Return my call or you will cease
to work for me.

55:18.861 --> 55:21.196
I don't care if you're with Rita Hayworth!

55:21.572 --> 55:22.698
Understand?

55:22.948 --> 55:24.366
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

55:27.494 --> 55:29.830
What the hell are you doing with this trial?

55:29.872 --> 55:31.165
Defending my client.

55:31.248 --> 55:33.792
Then why don't you defend him
for Christ's sake?

55:33.876 --> 55:37.129
Try to knock down the charges
as a crime of passion or figure out...

55:37.212 --> 55:39.673
...how you'll cross-examine
the witnesses...

55:39.756 --> 55:44.386
...instead of this "psychological coma" crap
that doesn't mean anything in court!

55:44.595 --> 55:46.763
I think it does. As long as it's my case-

55:46.847 --> 55:51.351
Fair enough. I tried to talk reasonably
to you, but you're not going for it, so...

55:52.019 --> 55:55.022
...you're not handling this case anymore.
It's done.

55:55.189 --> 55:56.523
Mr. Henkin...

55:57.441 --> 56:01.195
...they're printing my opening statement
in 250 newspapers across the country.

56:01.278 --> 56:04.698
If you want me off the case because
you're afraid of taking on Alcatraz...

56:04.781 --> 56:06.366
...that's your choice.

56:06.450 --> 56:10.037
But I'll just go to Jerry Hoolihan
and tell my side of the story.

56:10.621 --> 56:14.208
If you want to play hardball, sir,
I'll play hardball too.

56:20.088 --> 56:21.840
I'm trying to be your friend.

56:22.633 --> 56:24.635
You know who the warden of Alcatraz is?

56:24.718 --> 56:29.056
He's the most highly respected warden
in the US dealing with hardened criminals.

56:30.057 --> 56:32.726
If you try to make Humson
look like a Nazi...

56:33.227 --> 56:35.437
...they will eat you for breakfast.

56:44.404 --> 56:47.908
You'll die if I can't get corroboration
about what goes on over there.

56:47.950 --> 56:50.953
I need names! Names of men
who'll come and testify.

56:51.328 --> 56:54.498
What made you think
these men will come and testify?

56:54.581 --> 56:57.292
Maybe you got some friends
you don't know about.

56:57.960 --> 57:01.421
- You want to play cards?
- I'll make them testify with a court order!

57:01.505 --> 57:04.633
What about when they're back
on the Rock with Mr. Glenn?

57:04.716 --> 57:06.593
They'll kill them, that's what.

57:06.677 --> 57:09.721
This is our only chance.
We're talking about your life.

57:09.847 --> 57:13.767
For a smart guy, you're awfully slow.
I'm already dead. I told you that.

57:13.976 --> 57:16.311
You can't change Alcatraz.

57:16.687 --> 57:17.855
It just is.

57:17.938 --> 57:19.314
So why fight it?

57:19.439 --> 57:23.485
You stand in court preaching. I don't
even know what you're talking about.

57:23.652 --> 57:25.863
Justice. I'm talking about justice.

57:26.155 --> 57:29.032
I killed him, they saw it,
they're going to kill me.

57:29.116 --> 57:30.993
Nothing you say will change that.

57:31.034 --> 57:33.579
So I don't see what you're
so excited about.

57:33.871 --> 57:37.666
This trial doesn't interest you at all?
You don't care about it a bit?

57:38.792 --> 57:41.837
You look like you're having
a good time, so...

57:42.546 --> 57:44.173
No, I don't care.

57:44.548 --> 57:48.594
Main thing is, I got a friend my age
to talk to until they gas me.

57:49.386 --> 57:53.849
I'm not your friend, I'm your attorney.
I'm trying to save your life. Guard!

57:54.141 --> 57:56.518
You know, I have a sister, but...

57:57.561 --> 58:00.105
...I ain't seen her since they put me in jail.

58:00.189 --> 58:02.357
I got nothing. I got nobody.

58:02.566 --> 58:05.235
I don't need a lawyer. I need a friend.

58:05.903 --> 58:10.449
You're doing all this to prove something
to a guy named Darryl, not for me.

58:11.033 --> 58:13.202
You want to do something for me?

58:14.036 --> 58:15.704
Let's play cards.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.918
Go ahead and play cards.
I got a case to try.

58:21.001 --> 58:23.504
Hold it, Jim. Where are you going?

58:24.171 --> 58:25.714
Where are you going?

58:35.307 --> 58:38.393
<i>I'm Henri Young's attorney.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.</i>

58:38.602 --> 58:42.356
<i>I'm going to call prisoners to the stand
to testify about life on Alcatraz.</i>

58:42.439 --> 58:44.191
<i>Where are the dungeons?</i>

58:44.233 --> 58:46.527
<i>What is solitary time
in those dungeons like?</i>

58:46.610 --> 58:48.779
<i>I want the jury to know and understand.</i>

58:48.862 --> 58:51.865
<i>You tell them to get caught
robbing a bank. They'll find out.</i>

58:52.699 --> 58:54.326
I'm done talking.

59:08.966 --> 59:10.050
Mr. Murphy...

59:10.092 --> 59:14.596
...if we can get decent treatment for you,
it makes it possible for everyone.

59:14.805 --> 59:19.268
If we ignore cruelty in one place,
it makes it more acceptable everywhere.

59:19.560 --> 59:21.436
I ain't gonna do shit for you.

59:22.104 --> 59:24.940
You can't get me no good time
knocked off.

59:25.107 --> 59:26.984
You can't get me no privileges.

59:27.067 --> 59:31.071
You can't even get me seconds at dessert.
If I testify for anybody...

59:31.238 --> 59:34.408
...I testify for the DA.
He's got some juice here.

59:38.829 --> 59:42.249
<i>Mr. Baker, could you tell me anything
about Henri Young?</i>

59:42.457 --> 59:44.126
Don't know Henri Young.

59:45.252 --> 59:47.754
Could you tell us anything
about Mr. Glenn?

59:50.090 --> 59:52.092
Warden Glenn has always been
good to me.

59:55.137 --> 59:57.431
Have you ever been in the dungeons?

59:57.931 --> 01:00:00.309
I don't know nothing about no dungeons.

01:00:01.018 --> 01:00:02.436
That's all, ma'am.

01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:04.313
I gotta go now.

01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:09.693
Fuck you.

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:13.238
Did Mr. Glenn tell you
not to cooperate with me?

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:14.990
Fuck you.

01:00:15.157 --> 01:00:17.493
Where are the dungeons located?

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:20.037
Don't take my fucking picture!

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:27.211
You know I can get
a writ of habeas corpus testificandum...

01:00:27.294 --> 01:00:29.922
...and force you to come
and testify in court?

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:31.298
Fuck you!

01:00:32.758 --> 01:00:35.010
Thank you very much for your time.

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:36.637
Don't mention it.

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.265
And you, sweetheart...

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.476
I'd like to fuck you.

01:00:59.284 --> 01:01:01.703
<i>I hope your day has been fruitful.</i>

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:06.875
I don't see your photographer.
Is he still taking pictures?

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:08.585
He's trying to.

01:01:09.127 --> 01:01:11.672
We're not receiving a great deal
of cooperation.

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:15.425
It almost seems as though someone told
the prisoners not to talk to us.

01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:17.094
There's no conspiracy.

01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:18.887
No one talked to them.

01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:22.140
Maybe it's because they are
dangerous people who belong here...

01:01:22.224 --> 01:01:24.268
...with no interest in you or your case.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:27.521
- I'd like to see the dungeons.
- I'm sorry? Dungeons?

01:01:28.147 --> 01:01:30.440
The old citadel, the sub-level of the prison.

01:01:30.524 --> 01:01:32.401
That's mostly storage...

01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:34.319
...a few solitary cells.

01:01:34.403 --> 01:01:35.279
No dungeons.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:38.615
I would like to see
the solitary-confinement cells.

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:41.326
I would love to show those cells to you,
but I can't.

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:45.914
It's an insurance risk to visitors during a
riot. If you're there, we can't protect you.

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:47.749
Thank you for your concern.

01:01:48.167 --> 01:01:50.502
I could show you the exercise yard.

01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:53.964
You have papers.

01:01:54.423 --> 01:01:57.301
I have papers, so you can cut
the good-guy act.

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:01.430
I do consider myself
as one of the good guys...

01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:03.765
...and perhaps more than you...

01:02:03.974 --> 01:02:06.059
...I know what the bad guys are like.

01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:08.228
I'd like to read them. Please.

01:02:09.521 --> 01:02:10.689
Thank you.

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:13.984
That's a court order...

01:02:14.067 --> 01:02:17.654
<i>...instructing you to permit us access
to the solitary-confinement cells.</i>

01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:20.824
<i>And to allow the photographer
to take pictures of the same...</i>

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:23.952
<i>...to be used as exhibits in the trial
of The People vs. Young.</i>

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:26.288
<i>You are also instructed
to hand over to us...</i>

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.917
<i>...the complete medical
and disciplinary files as to therein.</i>

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:31.960
<i>If you refuse to do so...</i>

01:02:32.002 --> 01:02:35.088
<i>...you'll have to appear in court
and show just cause.</i>

01:02:41.803 --> 01:02:44.389
Why don't you take Miss McCasslin
out for some air?

01:02:44.473 --> 01:02:46.308
I was told not to leave you alone.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.562
I don't care. You may be used to
these conditions but obviously she's not.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.943
We've been searched. Take her outside,
or we'll discuss this with Mr. Glenn.

01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:57.361
All right.

01:02:57.611 --> 01:02:58.946
No more photos.

01:03:00.072 --> 01:03:01.323
You all right?

01:03:01.824 --> 01:03:02.825
Thanks.

01:03:03.033 --> 01:03:04.660
I just need some air.

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.017
My God!

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:53.709
My name's James Stamphill.
I'm Henri Young's attorney.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.378
I can force them to let you out
so you can testify...

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.380
<i>...in San Francisco in a court of law.</i>

01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:02.551
<i>You just have to give me your name.
I promise I will do what I said for you.</i>

01:04:17.316 --> 01:04:19.818
James, she's okay. Just needed some air.

01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:24.740
Can we go now?

01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:26.325
Feeling any better?

01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:29.411
I guess I'll make it.

01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:35.542
- Did you get anything?
- I got three names.

01:04:37.169 --> 01:04:38.212
Let's go.

01:04:39.796 --> 01:04:42.591
<i>Where did Stamphill get
the three names on this list?</i>

01:04:46.178 --> 01:04:47.554
I don't know.

01:04:47.596 --> 01:04:52.100
Can you trust these cons? They're smart
enough to look after their own interests.

01:04:52.184 --> 01:04:53.393
They told Glenn...

01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:57.773
<i>...James said he'd get them out of solitary
if they would testify for the defense...</i>

01:04:57.815 --> 01:04:59.858
<i>- ... and lie on the stand!
- That's a lie.</i>

01:04:59.942 --> 01:05:04.279
<i>- He wanted to find one convict willing-
- Jesus, this is goddamn bribery.</i>

01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:08.283
<i>It's prejudicing a witness.
You could get disbarred. It's gone too far.</i>

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.744
<i>Fire him. I don't care how you do it.</i>

01:05:10.786 --> 01:05:13.205
Why do you have to make it be like this?

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:16.124
Henri Young's my client.
It's my job to defend him!

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:17.209
Not anymore.

01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:18.252
What?

01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:21.296
He's been notified that Henkin
wants you off the case.

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.131
Henri will never go for it.

01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:26.093
- He did. He's been assigned a new lawyer.
- Who?

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:28.720
Me.

01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:31.515
Me.

01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:35.477
Henkin assigned me to the case.
I could take it or be fired. I had no choice.

01:05:35.894 --> 01:05:37.479
You stabbed me in the back?

01:05:37.563 --> 01:05:40.482
I'm not stabbing you!
I'm trying to save your job and mine!

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:44.444
What about Henri's life?
Isn't that more important than profit?

01:05:44.528 --> 01:05:47.322
I don't have a brother who's a partner
in a big law firm.

01:05:47.406 --> 01:05:51.451
There aren't any other jobs
waiting out there for a woman attorney.

01:05:51.535 --> 01:05:54.288
The only option I had was to do
what he told me to do.

01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:55.831
What could I have done?

01:05:55.873 --> 01:05:57.332
I'll see you.

01:06:18.187 --> 01:06:20.856
What we need to do is establish exactly...

01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:24.026
We have a lot of work to get to today,
if you don't mind.

01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:25.194
Stop that.

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:28.155
Jesus Christ, all I was doing was looking.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:30.199
I want to set you straight-

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.035
You set me straight
the minute you walked in.

01:06:33.368 --> 01:06:35.787
- Mr. Young-
- Please, call me Henri. Please.

01:06:35.871 --> 01:06:40.083
Mr. Young, I am not here to satisfy
any sexual fantasies that you may have.

01:06:43.295 --> 01:06:44.254
You're not?

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:46.965
No, I'm your attorney.

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:49.009
They're gonna kill me anyway.

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:53.639
You won't do me any good as an attorney.
You may as well be good for something.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:57.226
- Mr. Young, I can't-
- Please, call me Henri, can't you?

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.813
I just want to hear a lady call me Henri.

01:07:00.896 --> 01:07:02.272
Can't you, please?

01:07:02.815 --> 01:07:04.066
Just once.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.984
Please.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.988
Henri, listen, we have so-

01:07:10.072 --> 01:07:12.533
Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it.

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.037
I'm gonna touch you just a little bit.

01:07:17.246 --> 01:07:18.288
Just a little.

01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:19.873
Are you crazy?

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.751
Yeah, sure. It won't hurt you
to let me touch you.

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:26.088
Don't make me call the guard.
We're running late on...

01:07:26.922 --> 01:07:27.881
Stop that.

01:07:29.675 --> 01:07:30.592
Stop.

01:07:30.759 --> 01:07:32.594
Stop that! Stop that!

01:07:32.845 --> 01:07:35.139
I'm not touching you. I'm touching me.

01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:37.766
Guard!

01:07:41.937 --> 01:07:43.355
You have a problem?

01:07:46.358 --> 01:07:47.901
Did he do anything?

01:07:50.863 --> 01:07:51.905
No.

01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:53.740
Let me know if he does.

01:07:53.824 --> 01:07:55.659
No, I'd like to leave now.

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:15.637
- He wants to see you in there.
- What?

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.808
He wants to see you in there.

01:08:49.254 --> 01:08:52.216
So, why'd you want to meet here?
Neutral territory?

01:08:56.178 --> 01:08:58.263
Want to be my lawyer again?

01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:02.600
What happened to the other one?

01:09:02.684 --> 01:09:04.770
I don't know if I want her.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.939
Since I had her, I mean.

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:10.274
She was good, though.

01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:14.196
She was everything I wanted
my first experience to be.

01:09:14.446 --> 01:09:16.907
I was just talking and she came over.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.202
- She started touching me-
- That's great. That's great.

01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:26.750
Jim, I'm just playing a joke on you.

01:09:30.254 --> 01:09:32.256
I know she was your girlfriend.

01:09:32.548 --> 01:09:35.676
I remember from the smell of the perfume
on your jacket.

01:09:41.305 --> 01:09:42.640
So, Lawyer...

01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:46.228
...you want to come back?

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.647
I resigned.

01:09:50.566 --> 01:09:53.402
I guess that means
I'm in private practice now.

01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:56.530
I could've had her though.

01:09:57.823 --> 01:09:58.991
Of course...

01:09:59.783 --> 01:10:01.743
...she don't play cards.

01:10:09.418 --> 01:10:11.461
<i>After I got arrested, they...</i>

01:10:11.879 --> 01:10:13.338
<i>...took my sister away.</i>

01:10:14.173 --> 01:10:15.215
<i>They...</i>

01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:18.468
<i>...put her in a home or orphanage and...</i>

01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:20.888
<i>...I don't know...</i>

01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:25.267
<i>I don't know what happened to her.
Never saw her again.</i>

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:27.561
<i>My parents died when I was 7.</i>

01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:32.149
<i>It was just me and my brother, and he
didn't know anything about raising a child.</i>

01:10:32.774 --> 01:10:34.943
<i>He sent me off to boarding school.</i>

01:10:35.027 --> 01:10:37.362
<i>I did get to come home on holidays.</i>

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.657
He put me through law school...

01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:43.994
...then got me the job
at the public defender's office.

01:10:46.205 --> 01:10:48.123
He wanted me to do well.

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:53.545
We had a plan until you came along
and messed everything up.

01:10:54.046 --> 01:10:57.216
I wish I had been able to take care
of my little sister.

01:10:58.050 --> 01:10:59.218
I mean...

01:10:59.343 --> 01:11:01.178
...family's family, right?

01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:04.932
Henri, I'm sorry you're here.

01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:09.436
This here's paradise
compared to my last home.

01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:14.900
How about the case?
Do you want to talk about it a bit now?

01:11:14.983 --> 01:11:16.819
You never give up, do you?

01:11:21.073 --> 01:11:22.407
How about the Redskins?

01:11:22.491 --> 01:11:25.702
How do you think they'll do
against the Yankees this year?

01:11:26.829 --> 01:11:28.914
Redskins are a football team.

01:11:28.997 --> 01:11:31.041
Yankees are a baseball team.

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:35.128
Personally, I think the Redskins
will kick the shit out of them.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:39.424
Henri, I'm trying.

01:11:40.592 --> 01:11:41.635
I know.

01:11:41.885 --> 01:11:44.888
This is going to be
a private conversation, Byron.

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:47.724
It never took place, all right?

01:11:47.975 --> 01:11:50.686
- Is that all right, Thurgood?
- I suggested it.

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:55.274
That brother of yours is making
quite a little name for himself.

01:11:55.357 --> 01:11:57.317
We even heard his name in Washington.

01:11:57.359 --> 01:11:59.695
My brother has resigned from the case.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.614
Well, he was hired back again last night.

01:12:02.865 --> 01:12:04.992
What do you mean he was hired back?

01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:12.374
Your work here has been stellar.
I'd hate to see anything-

01:12:12.457 --> 01:12:14.209
What exactly are you saying?

01:12:14.293 --> 01:12:17.171
This administration is not going to allow...

01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:20.340
...public attention to be diverted
from all the good it's done...

01:12:20.424 --> 01:12:23.385
...by some kind of a witch hunt
in the Justice Department.

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:25.971
I'm just telling you what the score is.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.348
It's up to you to take care of him.

01:12:30.726 --> 01:12:33.604
Why would J. Edgar Hoover care
about what happens to Henri?

01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:37.065
Grow up. He doesn't care
about what happens to Henri.

01:12:37.191 --> 01:12:38.692
He cares about...

01:12:39.234 --> 01:12:41.528
...Alcatraz, the Justice Department...

01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:44.239
...Humson, the Administration.

01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:46.909
He can't have some kid from the P.D.'s-

01:12:46.992 --> 01:12:49.119
I'm not a public defender anymore.

01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:51.079
You know the point.

01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:55.542
The point is I'm trying to do what's right.
I'm talking about justice here.

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:58.962
You're disgusted about what happened
on Alcatraz. So am I.

01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:02.633
But if you tear the whole system down...

01:13:02.841 --> 01:13:05.052
...what does that say about America?

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.720
We're wrong.

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.431
We can't be wrong.

01:13:10.182 --> 01:13:14.603
The world is fighting right now
to preserve our system, our way of life.

01:13:15.187 --> 01:13:17.189
You can't attack it blindly.

01:13:17.314 --> 01:13:20.776
We're talking about one man here.
It's not that big of a deal.

01:13:21.985 --> 01:13:24.321
- You're under surveillance.
- What?

01:13:25.155 --> 01:13:28.742
Everyone is watching you.
Tell me how you plan to continue.

01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:34.331
You have to realize, no one will talk.
Everyone has been gotten to.

01:13:35.999 --> 01:13:37.376
I have somebody.

01:13:38.126 --> 01:13:39.086
Who?

01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:42.631
I can't tell you.

01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:45.551
So, now you don't trust me?

01:13:45.634 --> 01:13:47.719
You're my brother. I love you.

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:49.763
I need your help.

01:13:57.312 --> 01:13:59.439
I can't do it. I'm sorry...

01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:01.108
...but I can't.

01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:03.902
I can't.

01:14:16.582 --> 01:14:18.959
James, as a consolation...

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:22.421
...please don't put Humson on the stand.

01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:25.132
Why?

01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:28.468
Humson was handpicked by Hoover.

01:14:28.552 --> 01:14:32.431
It would save a lot of embarrassment
if you were to avoid Humson.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:36.768
I'll think about it.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.605
Thank you.

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:44.526
I'm sorry, Byron.

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.335
Yeah?

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:04.213
<i>Mr. Stamphill?</i>

01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:06.048
<i>This is James Stamphill.</i>

01:15:06.256 --> 01:15:09.218
<i>This is Derek Simpson.
Remember we talked before?</i>

01:15:09.301 --> 01:15:13.013
<i>Right. Of course, I remember.
Have you made your decision?</i>

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:18.977
<i>I've been thinking about what we were
talking about and I'd like to be a witness.</i>

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:20.646
<i>Wonderful.</i>

01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:23.816
<i>You do understand you must testify
in court under oath...</i>

01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:26.443
<i>...about the brutality you witnessed
at Alcatraz.</i>

01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:27.694
<i>I know that.</i>

01:15:27.778 --> 01:15:30.239
<i>Particularly in reference to Henri Young.</i>

01:15:31.281 --> 01:15:33.033
<i>I know some things.</i>

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:36.078
<i>Do you hold any sort of grudge...</i>

01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:38.622
<i>...against Warden Humson
or Associate Warden Glenn?</i>

01:15:38.705 --> 01:15:39.706
<i>No.</i>

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:43.168
<i>I'll come over and we can speak in person.</i>

01:15:43.252 --> 01:15:45.295
<i>Yes. I'm in Chinatown.</i>

01:15:46.255 --> 01:15:49.633
<i>It's an alley called Scotland Court.
The number there is 964.</i>

01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:03.605
Mr. Simpson, are you in here?

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:09.862
Mr. Simpson, are you all right?

01:16:22.457 --> 01:16:23.792
You all right?

01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:27.296
Do you still want to be a witness?

01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:41.226
Who's she?

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:43.687
She's a court reporter.

01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.481
What happened to your face?

01:16:45.647 --> 01:16:48.525
My face had a little accident this morning.

01:16:48.609 --> 01:16:50.861
We need to get one more deposition...

01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:51.778
No.

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:55.324
...regarding the beatings you received.
Your eye, your leg...

01:16:56.825 --> 01:17:00.162
Remember when you told me
you'd never been with a woman before?

01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:02.915
Henri, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Henri.

01:17:03.165 --> 01:17:04.500
Nice to meet you.

01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:08.295
You got about four minutes before
the next guard arrives, so you gotta hurry.

01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:12.466
I can't leave the room. I'm just going
to be over here. I'll turn my back.

01:17:13.175 --> 01:17:14.760
We can get acquainted.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.769
Come on, honey, we don't have all night.

01:17:24.853 --> 01:17:26.104
Thanks, Jim.

01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:28.148
You're a good friend.

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:30.901
Oh, boy.

01:17:39.284 --> 01:17:40.953
Thanks. Hi, Charlie.

01:17:42.538 --> 01:17:43.747
What's the story?

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:46.792
The attorney and a reporter inside
with the prisoner.

01:17:46.917 --> 01:17:50.212
- Is he shackled?
- Yeah. Otherwise, it's pretty quiet.

01:17:55.133 --> 01:17:56.260
Sweetie...

01:17:56.510 --> 01:18:00.931
...you have to get it up first. That's like
sticking an oyster into a slot machine.

01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.432
Give me that.

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:10.983
- I can't.
- You can.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.818
Yeah, you can.

01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:14.862
I can't, sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:14.945 --> 01:18:17.531
- Except for the $5 you owe me.
- For what?

01:18:17.739 --> 01:18:21.326
What, you didn't listen?
Louis knocks Nova out in the sixth round.

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.078
That bum.

01:18:23.745 --> 01:18:25.038
Give me the money.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.665
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:28.417
I can't. I can't.

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.210
- You can.
- I can't!

01:18:37.259 --> 01:18:38.760
"Adios", Charlie.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.433
You know what?

01:18:47.769 --> 01:18:49.605
It's gonna cost extra, you know.

01:18:50.439 --> 01:18:52.357
Just do what you have to do.

01:19:26.642 --> 01:19:27.768
I can't.

01:19:30.062 --> 01:19:31.271
I'm sorry.

01:19:36.151 --> 01:19:37.110
I can't.

01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:49.540
Hey, we only had a few minutes.

01:19:50.415 --> 01:19:53.001
You got another guy in the room.
That's okay.

01:20:04.096 --> 01:20:05.347
Shh, baby.

01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:14.356
Your Honor, the defense calls
Associate Warden, Mr. Milton Glenn.

01:20:30.497 --> 01:20:33.709
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.919
- So help me God.
- You may be seated.

01:20:46.597 --> 01:20:51.185
As associate warden, you are responsible
for the day-to-day running of the prison?

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:52.519
You could say that.

01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:55.189
Then you must be familiar
with the dungeons.

01:20:55.731 --> 01:20:57.357
I'm sure you've heard of them.

01:20:57.399 --> 01:21:00.235
Some prisoners refer
to the lower levels as dungeons.

01:21:00.527 --> 01:21:03.530
They refer to bread and water
as piss and punk.

01:21:04.239 --> 01:21:07.701
The dictionary definition of a dungeon is:
"A close, dark prison...

01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:10.287
"...or vault, commonly underground."

01:21:10.913 --> 01:21:14.875
The walls of those cells are 6 feet by 9,
and the roof 5 to 6 feet tall.

01:21:14.917 --> 01:21:17.628
- Would you call that close?
- In my opinion, no.

01:21:17.753 --> 01:21:20.797
- Are there any light fixtures?
- No, but there aren't any books.

01:21:20.881 --> 01:21:21.840
Your Honor...

01:21:22.382 --> 01:21:26.178
...the defense offers these photographs
as defense exhibits B, C, D, E and F.

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:29.515
How much light is in these cells
with no window and the door closed?

01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:32.726
- Not much.
- How long was Henri held in such a cell?

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.394
I don't know exactly.

01:21:34.436 --> 01:21:37.773
Three years and two months!
I have the records, if you'd like to see.

01:21:38.106 --> 01:21:40.484
- That sounds right.
- Three years and two months.

01:21:40.567 --> 01:21:44.446
In that time, how often was Henri Young
allowed outside for exercise?

01:21:44.738 --> 01:21:49.076
Mr. Stamphill, I do not believe that
the exercise time of an inmate is relevant.

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:50.702
I do. Answer the question.

01:21:50.786 --> 01:21:52.621
- Objection!
- Objection overruled!

01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:54.540
Henri Young tried to escape.

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:58.043
When a criminal escapes from prison,
he doesn't go job-hunting.

01:21:58.126 --> 01:22:01.755
He robs somebody or kills somebody.
We do all we can to discourage escape.

01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:05.759
In three years and two months, how often
was Henri allowed outside for exercise?

01:22:06.343 --> 01:22:09.012
- Men sentenced to Alcatraz-
- Answer the question!

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:12.432
How often was he allowed
outside for exercise?

01:22:12.558 --> 01:22:15.769
- Objection! He's badgering the witness.
- Objection overruled.

01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:18.272
Mr. Glenn, you will answer that question.

01:22:19.606 --> 01:22:21.358
Young man, I do not recall.

01:22:22.025 --> 01:22:23.318
You don't know?

01:22:23.443 --> 01:22:27.531
Surely a half hour a year isn't
too difficult to recall, now, is it?

01:22:28.407 --> 01:22:30.868
- There is no place in my court for sarcasm.
- Sorry.

01:22:30.951 --> 01:22:33.495
I have here a list with 32 names on it.

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.624
These are men who were prisoners
at Alcatraz during your tenure. Correct?

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:39.960
I can't remember the name
of every prisoner.

01:22:40.002 --> 01:22:44.047
I have committal papers with your
signature as well as the late Dr. Kiley's.

01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:46.049
This is defense exhibit G.

01:22:46.842 --> 01:22:51.221
All these men were taken off Alcatraz in
straitjackets and put in mental institutions.

01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:52.931
- Is that correct?
- Objection!

01:22:53.015 --> 01:22:54.475
The question is immaterial.

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:59.313
Immaterial? Your Honor, I'm saying in lay
terms that Alcatraz drives people insane.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:04.359
It has already done so in 32 instances.
If this is not true, the witness can say so.

01:23:04.443 --> 01:23:06.653
If it is true, it is most material...

01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:09.656
...and the jury ought to be privy
to that knowledge.

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:11.283
Objection overruled.

01:23:11.366 --> 01:23:12.409
Thank you.

01:23:12.493 --> 01:23:13.494
Now...

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.998
...is it not true that these men were taken
off Alcatraz in straightjackets...

01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:22.544
...and placed in mental institutions
and you and Dr. Kiley signed the papers?

01:23:22.628 --> 01:23:23.420
True.

01:23:23.504 --> 01:23:26.215
Is it not also true that of these 32 men...

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.843
...28 of them had never before set foot
inside a mental institution?

01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:32.513
- I don't know.
- Would you like to see the records?

01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:34.389
I'll take your word for it.

01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:37.392
Here are men who came to Alcatraz
legally sane...

01:23:37.684 --> 01:23:41.396
...were subjected to the conditions
of Alcatraz, then deemed to be insane.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.564
Is that correct?

01:23:42.648 --> 01:23:45.442
Yes, but you can't say
that one causes the other.

01:23:45.609 --> 01:23:49.279
Insanity's not a virus, is it?
It's not something we're all going to catch.

01:23:49.363 --> 01:23:52.032
Objection, the witness is not
a psychiatrist!

01:23:52.074 --> 01:23:53.575
Objection sustained.

01:23:53.909 --> 01:23:55.077
Mr. Stamphill...

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.413
...confine your questions to areas
of Mr. Glenn's expertise.

01:23:58.455 --> 01:24:02.125
Very well, Mr. Glenn's expertise!
Have you ever beaten a prisoner?

01:24:02.334 --> 01:24:03.585
No, that's illegal.

01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:05.504
- Not even when provoked?
- No!

01:24:05.921 --> 01:24:08.882
You've never hit, kicked,
used a blackjack or a razor?

01:24:08.924 --> 01:24:11.552
You've never punched a prisoner
in your entire career?

01:24:11.635 --> 01:24:13.595
- Objection, Your Honor!
- Sustained.

01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:15.848
Confine yourself to one question at a time.

01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:20.394
Is it not true you ordered two guards to
throw Henri down a steel flight of stairs?

01:24:20.477 --> 01:24:22.855
That you smashed his face
with a blackjack?

01:24:22.938 --> 01:24:26.775
That you took a straight razor, sliced open
his ankle, hobbling him for life?

01:24:26.817 --> 01:24:28.277
Answer the question!

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.194
Objection!

01:24:29.278 --> 01:24:33.157
- He testified he didn't beat any prisoners.
- He's testified to a lot of things.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.493
Are you aware that, in a federal court
system, perjury is a crime?

01:24:36.577 --> 01:24:38.745
- You could go to jail!
- Young is on trial!

01:24:38.829 --> 01:24:42.833
Mind you, young man, that Henri Young
is the one on trial here, not me!

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:46.003
I am a public servant!
I am not the bad guy!

01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:50.007
I will not be treated the same way as this,
this lying, murdering...

01:24:50.174 --> 01:24:51.550
...two-time loser!

01:24:51.842 --> 01:24:53.343
Silence, Mr. Glenn!

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:57.598
Mr. Stamphill, you are perilously close
to contempt of this court!

01:24:58.599 --> 01:25:01.477
You will proceed with caution!
Is that understood?

01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:05.606
Temper, temper.

01:25:08.859 --> 01:25:11.195
Would you care to withdraw
any testimony?

01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:14.823
You wouldn't want somebody to testify
to the contrary, would you?

01:25:15.365 --> 01:25:17.951
No. I would not withdraw any testimony...

01:25:18.535 --> 01:25:20.746
...no matter what Henri Young
has told you.

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:24.166
I'm not talking about Henri Young.
Who would believe him?

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:28.420
Mr. Simpson, did you ever beat
this man, Henri Young?

01:25:28.504 --> 01:25:30.464
Objection! This has no bearing.

01:25:30.547 --> 01:25:34.051
No bearing? Beatings have a bearing
on a man's state of mind.

01:25:34.218 --> 01:25:36.512
So does three years of darkness.

01:25:36.637 --> 01:25:40.641
Do we need to be psychologists to know
that? You know that. I know you do.

01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:42.017
Objection overruled.

01:25:42.059 --> 01:25:43.644
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:25:44.311 --> 01:25:47.314
<i>Did you ever beat Henri Young
with a blackjack?</i>

01:25:47.523 --> 01:25:48.357
<i>Yes.</i>

01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:51.360
<i>Did you ever throw Henri Young
down a steel flight of stairs?</i>

01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:52.277
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

01:25:52.361 --> 01:25:54.404
<i>- You were ordered to do this?
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:25:54.488 --> 01:25:56.073
<i>Tell us the name of the man...</i>

01:25:56.156 --> 01:25:59.034
...who was your superior who ordered you
to do these things.

01:25:59.117 --> 01:26:00.202
Mr. Glenn.

01:26:00.327 --> 01:26:03.038
You never went to Warden Humson
about these matters?

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:03.956
No, sir.

01:26:04.039 --> 01:26:08.252
Thank you very much. I won't ask where
you got your bruises. I already know.

01:26:08.836 --> 01:26:11.839
The prosecution would like to mark
for identification...

01:26:11.922 --> 01:26:14.591
...the employment records
of Mr. Derek Simpson.

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:16.176
Do you recall...

01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:19.471
...being suspended on November 4, 1936...

01:26:19.763 --> 01:26:22.307
...and again on July 6, 1937?

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:24.226
Yeah.

01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:25.519
Speak up.

01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:27.396
Yes.

01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:32.860
Is it not a fact you were fired from your job
as a guard because you are a drunk?

01:26:33.068 --> 01:26:34.903
- Objection!
- That's not true!

01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:35.779
Objection!

01:26:35.863 --> 01:26:37.322
- Overruled.
- Mr. Glenn...

01:26:37.406 --> 01:26:39.533
...wouldn't tolerate this in a prison.

01:26:39.616 --> 01:26:42.286
Isn't it true, having cost you your job...

01:26:42.452 --> 01:26:45.414
...you would say anything
to get even with Mr. Glenn?

01:26:46.206 --> 01:26:49.293
<i>The jury will disregard
Mr. Simpson's testimony.</i>

01:26:50.794 --> 01:26:54.256
Good afternoon, Mr. Stamphill,
is everything all right?

01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:07.436
- Son of a bitch!
- What happened?

01:27:07.519 --> 01:27:09.313
You know exactly! You set me up!

01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:10.564
What are you talking about?

01:27:10.647 --> 01:27:12.691
You took Simpson's picture
off of my desk!

01:27:12.774 --> 01:27:15.903
They never would've known
to tear him down if you hadn't told them!

01:27:15.986 --> 01:27:18.071
Are you going to hit me now?

01:27:18.322 --> 01:27:19.406
Go ahead.

01:27:19.823 --> 01:27:22.659
It's about time you grew up
and were a man.

01:27:27.623 --> 01:27:29.041
You're my brother.

01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:31.335
You had me beaten up.

01:27:31.585 --> 01:27:33.837
That was not supposed to happen.

01:27:34.254 --> 01:27:36.840
Only Simpson. You walked in,
it was bad timing.

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:38.133
Bad timing?

01:27:41.637 --> 01:27:43.096
Humson will testify.

01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:45.974
Why, James?
Humson doesn't know anything!

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:50.938
He runs three prisons. He has to know
something. Unless he's never there.

01:27:55.526 --> 01:27:56.860
Son of a bitch.

01:28:01.365 --> 01:28:03.033
He was never there.

01:28:03.534 --> 01:28:04.618
Never there.

01:28:04.701 --> 01:28:06.203
You never saw him?

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:09.665
You'd hear about him visiting,
but I never saw him.

01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:14.378
Your own brother did that to you?
Your brother did that to you?

01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:16.630
Jesus, rich people are weird.

01:28:18.549 --> 01:28:22.678
You hear DiMaggio broke Keeler's record?
Forty-five straight games.

01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:25.597
Wouldn't it be great if he never stopped?

01:28:25.681 --> 01:28:27.599
Dock records would show his visits.

01:28:27.683 --> 01:28:31.395
Every trip is recorded. I had to sign in
myself that one time I went.

01:28:31.478 --> 01:28:33.313
- What?
- We're friends, huh?

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.565
Yeah, sure.

01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:36.525
Is it over? I mean, you know?

01:28:36.567 --> 01:28:37.693
Is that all?

01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:41.071
Nothing more you're going to do
with the trial?

01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:42.865
Thought you didn't care.

01:28:42.906 --> 01:28:44.324
No, I don't care.

01:28:44.491 --> 01:28:48.495
It's just that as long as you got shit
to throw at them, we can keep talking.

01:28:48.579 --> 01:28:50.497
But when it's over, it's over.

01:28:50.539 --> 01:28:53.375
I'm not here to entertain you
until the executioner comes.

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.377
This trial isn't a game.

01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:03.510
If I was on the outside, if there was...

01:29:04.219 --> 01:29:08.182
...a good fairy and she waved a wand
and I was on the outside...

01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:10.809
...you and me, would we be friends then?

01:29:11.351 --> 01:29:12.352
Yes.

01:29:12.561 --> 01:29:15.022
No, no, no, we wouldn't.

01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:18.734
You wouldn't have nothing to do with me.
You know it.

01:29:18.859 --> 01:29:21.570
What I can't figure out is why. I mean...

01:29:22.029 --> 01:29:26.033
...we both ain't got nobody else
and we're the same age, sort of.

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.411
If I'd have lived in your house...

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:32.873
...and they'd have switched us
when we was babies...

01:29:33.749 --> 01:29:36.251
...I could have been just like you.

01:29:36.585 --> 01:29:38.420
If they stuck you in the hole...

01:29:40.464 --> 01:29:42.299
...you could be sitting here...

01:29:42.382 --> 01:29:45.594
...like me, asking why we couldn't
be friends on the outside.

01:29:45.636 --> 01:29:47.638
You ever steal five bucks?

01:29:51.141 --> 01:29:52.226
Once.

01:29:52.976 --> 01:29:54.812
When I was a kid, from my...

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:57.022
...brother's wallet.

01:29:58.232 --> 01:29:59.233
What happened?

01:30:01.777 --> 01:30:03.987
He told me not to do it again.

01:30:07.324 --> 01:30:10.410
Why'd they put me in that hole
for three years?

01:30:11.787 --> 01:30:13.997
I could have been just like you.

01:30:16.834 --> 01:30:19.044
I'd just like to ask them, you know.

01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:35.269
<i>Raise your right hand.</i>

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:40.190
<i>Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?</i>

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.942
<i>So help me God.</i>

01:30:42.317 --> 01:30:43.944
You may be seated.

01:30:48.949 --> 01:30:53.162
Warden Humson, in a book you wrote,
you refer to the convicts as your children.

01:30:53.704 --> 01:30:57.749
You liken your job to that of a parent,
providing for their physical needs...

01:30:57.833 --> 01:30:59.793
...and molding their character.

01:31:00.043 --> 01:31:01.712
Yes, I wrote that.

01:31:02.129 --> 01:31:04.423
I have a record of a prisoner
named Johnson...

01:31:04.506 --> 01:31:07.134
...who did a total of 500 days
in the lower cells.

01:31:07.217 --> 01:31:08.886
The hole, the dungeon.

01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:14.016
This was over a ten-year period for such
offenses as not finishing all his food...

01:31:14.558 --> 01:31:18.479
...having an extra pair of socks in his cell,
keeping an untidy cell...

01:31:18.979 --> 01:31:23.150
...smuggling food from the dining room,
crumbs, in fact, for a pet lizard.

01:31:23.358 --> 01:31:25.652
Is this what you mean
"molding character"?

01:31:26.153 --> 01:31:27.488
No, no, no.

01:31:27.654 --> 01:31:29.490
You're twisting things here.

01:31:29.656 --> 01:31:34.369
The isolation cells were simply a tool
of a temporary nature...

01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:38.290
...for extreme cases
within the general population.

01:31:39.374 --> 01:31:44.004
Moreover, you make it sound like
the prisoner did 1,500 days at one stretch...

01:31:44.254 --> 01:31:45.839
...for one infraction.

01:31:46.924 --> 01:31:48.383
That's not true.

01:31:49.593 --> 01:31:51.470
Prisoners were held...

01:31:51.678 --> 01:31:53.597
...for 19 days at a time.

01:31:54.681 --> 01:31:56.350
- That's all.
- That's all.

01:31:57.434 --> 01:32:01.522
Perhaps you can tell me why Henri Young
did over 1,000 days in the dungeon?

01:32:01.688 --> 01:32:04.066
Not 19 days, but 1,000 days...

01:32:04.691 --> 01:32:08.195
...in total darkness with only 30 minutes
of daylight a year.

01:32:08.403 --> 01:32:10.030
He tried to escape.

01:32:10.405 --> 01:32:14.785
You can't compare his offense with that
of a man who smuggled food to a lizard.

01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:18.330
Was this the first time a sentence
of three years had been imposed?

01:32:18.413 --> 01:32:19.748
It wasn't a sentence.

01:32:19.832 --> 01:32:22.626
It was an administrative decision
to place him there...

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:25.129
...for an undetermined amount of time.

01:32:25.796 --> 01:32:29.633
Why not a time limit? Doesn't that seem
a little bit inhumane? No time limit.

01:32:29.716 --> 01:32:31.218
Put simply, no.

01:32:32.928 --> 01:32:35.389
While we strive to prevent crime...

01:32:35.639 --> 01:32:38.433
...what should we do with a man
who has committed it?

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:42.312
We aim to make him his better self.

01:32:43.147 --> 01:32:44.648
His better self.

01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:48.318
I'm sure that Henri Young thanks you
for his better self.

01:32:48.485 --> 01:32:52.656
It's a fact you simply put Henri Young
in that dungeon and forgot all about him.

01:32:53.073 --> 01:32:54.658
Washed your hands of him.

01:32:54.741 --> 01:32:58.162
Henri wanted me to ask you, "Why?"
Why would you do that, sir? Why?

01:32:58.245 --> 01:32:59.746
That's not true.

01:32:59.955 --> 01:33:01.081
Objection.

01:33:01.248 --> 01:33:04.001
I withdraw the question.
I apologize to the jury-

01:33:04.084 --> 01:33:06.336
It's not necessary that you apologize.

01:33:07.171 --> 01:33:10.048
Actually, Your Honor, it is.
I made a mistake.

01:33:10.507 --> 01:33:14.511
The warden couldn't simply have washed
his hands of Henri Young...

01:33:14.845 --> 01:33:17.639
...because he had absolutely no idea
he was there.

01:33:17.681 --> 01:33:19.183
Isn't that true?

01:33:19.266 --> 01:33:23.145
You're never there. You permit Glenn
to run that prison any way he sees fit.

01:33:23.187 --> 01:33:27.107
I am there as much as I need to be.
I run three penal institutions.

01:33:27.483 --> 01:33:30.819
It's impossible to know every detail
of every inmate.

01:33:31.528 --> 01:33:36.116
I have the Port Authority records that you
signed every time you went to Alcatraz.

01:33:37.117 --> 01:33:40.746
You went seven times in '38,
five in '39, ten in '40...

01:33:41.038 --> 01:33:43.040
...and only twice so far this year.

01:33:43.123 --> 01:33:45.417
Twenty-four day trips in over 3-1/2 years...

01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:48.879
...while Henri Young was in that dungeon
over 1,000 days.

01:33:49.046 --> 01:33:51.256
Twenty-four out of 1,000 days.

01:33:51.548 --> 01:33:53.926
That's how much you needed to be there?

01:33:54.009 --> 01:33:58.388
You knew nothing about a man who was
left to die in a dungeon for 3-1/2 years.

01:33:58.472 --> 01:33:59.640
Absolutely nothing!

01:33:59.723 --> 01:34:03.143
In fact, you have never even met
Henri Young, have you?

01:34:03.727 --> 01:34:07.898
Right now, in fact, is the first time
you have ever seen this man! Look at him!

01:34:08.315 --> 01:34:10.859
That's him there! That's Henri Young!
Right there!

01:34:10.943 --> 01:34:12.736
- He tried to escape.
- Yes, he did.

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:16.949
But the fact, the cold, brutal fact is
that this man...

01:34:17.074 --> 01:34:19.743
...who had never,
never before in his entire life...

01:34:19.827 --> 01:34:22.496
...harmed or attempted to harm
another human being...

01:34:22.579 --> 01:34:24.164
...was now a murderer!

01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:25.833
That is a fact!

01:34:25.874 --> 01:34:28.085
- Yes, but he tried to escape.
- It's a fact-

01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:33.173
You can't let them get away with this.
If we let them, where would we be?

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:37.511
- Should we let murderers roam free?
- Henri Young was not a murderer!

01:34:37.845 --> 01:34:41.265
Henri Young was not a murderer
until Alcatraz got a hold of him!

01:34:41.348 --> 01:34:45.853
The prison runs under your guidelines,
so you created the murderer, didn't you?

01:34:46.061 --> 01:34:47.271
Didn't you?

01:34:48.772 --> 01:34:50.691
He tried to escape.

01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:55.362
That's the thing, you see.

01:35:01.285 --> 01:35:04.288
Do you have any further questions
for this witness?

01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:09.126
- No, Your Honor.
- The witness may step down.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.628
But he tried to escape.

01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:16.925
<i>I'd been trained all my life for that day.
Control the witness, go for the kill.</i>

01:35:17.718 --> 01:35:19.178
<i>Win, victory.</i>

01:35:20.596 --> 01:35:22.473
<i>School prepared me well.</i>

01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:24.892
<i>My brother, he had prepared me well.</i>

01:35:25.601 --> 01:35:28.228
<i>Years later, he and I would reconcile.</i>

01:35:29.313 --> 01:35:31.148
<i>Family's family, you know.</i>

01:35:32.649 --> 01:35:34.526
<i>Mary congratulated me...</i>

01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:37.070
<i>...but we'd already begun to drift apart.</i>

01:35:38.405 --> 01:35:41.992
<i>When you only try to win,
you sometimes lose sight of the goal...</i>

01:35:42.826 --> 01:35:45.329
<i>...which should have always
remained Henri.</i>

01:35:56.673 --> 01:35:59.927
<i>The most you'll get is
second-degree murder.</i>

01:36:00.135 --> 01:36:01.762
<i>Maybe manslaughter, ten years.</i>

01:36:01.804 --> 01:36:04.431
<i>If you get a recommendation
for clemency, you'll walk.</i>

01:36:04.515 --> 01:36:07.851
- You have your whole life in front of you.
- Monday morning...

01:36:08.143 --> 01:36:11.772
...go up to the judge and tell him
there's been a change of plan.

01:36:11.939 --> 01:36:14.274
I want you to change my plea to guilty.

01:36:16.193 --> 01:36:17.361
Is that a joke?

01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:18.946
Not to me, it's not.

01:36:19.363 --> 01:36:20.781
I'm not doing it.

01:36:21.198 --> 01:36:24.409
What have I been doing here?
Why have I been wasting my time?

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.037
I never thought we'd win.

01:36:27.663 --> 01:36:29.623
I thought you wanted to fight.

01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:31.041
I just...

01:36:31.542 --> 01:36:33.001
...wanted a friend.

01:36:33.168 --> 01:36:34.795
I am your friend.

01:36:34.878 --> 01:36:37.589
No, you're not. It's always about you.

01:36:38.465 --> 01:36:41.218
It's never about me.
You don't understand.

01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:44.721
I already lost and you just keep talking...

01:36:45.305 --> 01:36:47.808
...and talking and you never listen.

01:36:47.975 --> 01:36:52.229
You don't know what you're talking about.
You just don't know what it's like.

01:36:52.396 --> 01:36:53.605
What what's like?

01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:54.898
Alcatraz!

01:36:56.066 --> 01:36:59.862
Where do you think they'll send me
for those ten years you're talking about?

01:36:59.903 --> 01:37:01.989
They'll send me back to Alcatraz!

01:37:02.197 --> 01:37:04.491
When it's over, you'll be alive!

01:37:04.533 --> 01:37:05.659
I'm Henri!

01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:08.871
I'm the one that's got to do the time,
not you!

01:37:09.329 --> 01:37:11.707
And I can't do it! I can't do it!

01:37:12.207 --> 01:37:13.917
I can't, all right?

01:37:15.836 --> 01:37:17.421
It's not worth it.

01:37:17.838 --> 01:37:19.214
It's not worth it.

01:37:19.923 --> 01:37:22.009
Nothing's worth going back there.

01:37:25.512 --> 01:37:29.391
<i>Sixty-seven thousand fans
at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland...</i>

01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:34.354
<i>...watching to see if Joe DiMaggio can keep
his 56-game hitting streak alive.</i>

01:37:34.521 --> 01:37:38.567
<i>Jim Bank is on the mound,
count one and one, runner on first base.</i>

01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:41.862
<i>Here's the pitch. DiMaggio swings.</i>

01:37:49.369 --> 01:37:53.123
<i>It's a double play! DiMaggio's 56-game
hitting streak is stopped!</i>

01:38:00.047 --> 01:38:01.548
Mrs. Rosetta Dial?

01:38:17.314 --> 01:38:18.816
Why are we in here?

01:38:18.982 --> 01:38:22.069
Maybe there are some things
worth fighting for.

01:38:28.992 --> 01:38:30.077
Henri?

01:38:30.994 --> 01:38:32.496
Do I know you?

01:38:35.999 --> 01:38:37.459
I'm Rosetta, Henri.

01:38:39.002 --> 01:38:40.587
I'm your sister.

01:38:50.848 --> 01:38:52.599
My baby's name is Henri.

01:38:59.439 --> 01:39:01.191
Mr. Stamphill says-

01:39:01.358 --> 01:39:02.609
I was...

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.613
...beginning to think...

01:39:08.949 --> 01:39:11.118
...that you wasn't real. That I...

01:39:12.327 --> 01:39:14.121
...made you up in my mind.

01:39:17.374 --> 01:39:19.042
I want you to come-

01:39:20.878 --> 01:39:23.380
I want you to tell Jim that I appreciate...

01:39:23.464 --> 01:39:25.966
...him bringing you down here
and knowing...

01:39:26.133 --> 01:39:28.051
...that you turned out okay.

01:39:28.969 --> 01:39:32.890
That means a lot. I want you to tell him,
come Monday morning...

01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:37.060
...he's going to plead me guilty
just like I said.

01:39:40.898 --> 01:39:42.566
I wish I wasn't...

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.068
...so scared of them, Rosetta.

01:39:48.071 --> 01:39:49.865
I wish to God I wasn't.

01:40:08.008 --> 01:40:09.927
You take care of yourself now.

01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:15.552
<i>You may call your next witness.</i>

01:42:16.386 --> 01:42:17.888
Just a second.

01:42:19.264 --> 01:42:20.349
I'm your friend.

01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:23.143
On the outside, I'd be lucky
to consider you my friend.

01:42:23.185 --> 01:42:24.978
So I'm not going to kill you.

01:42:25.062 --> 01:42:28.649
- Are you going to call a witness today?
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:33.695
If you want to change your plea,
you go do it. I'm not going to do it.

01:42:33.779 --> 01:42:36.657
- I want you to plead me guilty.
- I don't think you are.

01:42:36.698 --> 01:42:38.200
- Doesn't matter.
- Does to me.

01:42:38.283 --> 01:42:41.203
Counselor, I am very close to finding you
in contempt of-

01:42:41.286 --> 01:42:43.539
The defense calls Mr. Henri Young.

01:42:43.789 --> 01:42:44.790
No!

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.542
He just lost the case.

01:42:46.625 --> 01:42:48.627
You go up and change your plea.

01:42:48.794 --> 01:42:51.296
I repeat, I'm not going to do it for you.

01:42:53.048 --> 01:42:54.133
Counselor-

01:42:54.716 --> 01:42:56.135
He's coming.

01:42:57.803 --> 01:42:59.138
Go ahead, tell them.

01:43:08.230 --> 01:43:09.731
Tell them, not me.

01:43:14.486 --> 01:43:16.363
Better ask the right questions.

01:43:16.405 --> 01:43:18.949
- I'll ask what I want.
- I'll answer what I want.

01:43:19.032 --> 01:43:20.409
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:27.124
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.

01:43:32.337 --> 01:43:33.380
Stand up.

01:43:33.755 --> 01:43:35.591
Put your hand on the Bible.

01:43:39.303 --> 01:43:43.432
Do you swear to tell the truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:43:43.599 --> 01:43:44.766
So help me God.

01:43:44.850 --> 01:43:46.185
State your name.

01:43:46.351 --> 01:43:47.769
Henri Young.

01:43:47.936 --> 01:43:49.188
Be seated.

01:43:49.938 --> 01:43:51.106
Your Honor-

01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:52.941
Wait until I've asked a question!

01:43:53.025 --> 01:43:55.486
- I haven't asked you yet.
- He's trying to trick me.

01:43:55.569 --> 01:43:59.239
Please instruct the witness to remain silent
until I ask a question...

01:43:59.281 --> 01:44:01.450
...and only answer the question I ask.

01:44:01.533 --> 01:44:02.701
He's your witness.

01:44:03.202 --> 01:44:04.286
He won't listen.

01:44:04.453 --> 01:44:05.913
He's trying to trick me!

01:44:05.954 --> 01:44:07.331
Silence, Mr. Young.

01:44:08.123 --> 01:44:11.794
Here's the way it works.
Mr. Stamphill will ask you a question...

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.796
...and you answer that question.

01:44:13.879 --> 01:44:18.383
However, Mr. Stamphill cannot coerce you
into testifying against yourself.

01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.135
You do understand that?

01:44:20.219 --> 01:44:21.762
Yeah, I just want to-

01:44:22.221 --> 01:44:26.308
Did we have a conversation in which
you said you wish to change your plea-

01:44:27.559 --> 01:44:31.230
You will wait until I have finished
instructing the witness.

01:44:31.563 --> 01:44:33.649
It's okay. I wanted him to ask that.

01:44:33.899 --> 01:44:35.442
It is not okay.

01:44:36.401 --> 01:44:40.781
And I do not need you to tell me
what is or is not okay.

01:44:41.824 --> 01:44:44.326
In this courtroom,
I am the one who decides...

01:44:44.368 --> 01:44:46.578
...what is or is not okay.

01:44:47.621 --> 01:44:48.372
Okay?

01:44:49.498 --> 01:44:50.165
Yes.

01:44:50.332 --> 01:44:51.834
Thank you very much.

01:44:54.336 --> 01:44:56.338
Counselors, approach the bench.

01:45:00.509 --> 01:45:03.512
Do you mind telling me
what the hell is going on here?

01:45:03.595 --> 01:45:04.513
I'm trying-

01:45:04.596 --> 01:45:07.891
Your own defendant is looking to me
to protect him from you.

01:45:07.975 --> 01:45:09.309
So what's going on?

01:45:09.351 --> 01:45:11.812
I know it seems very strange but-

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.858
In my opinion, you're an idiot to put him
on the stand for any reason.

01:45:15.941 --> 01:45:18.360
You're asking him to testify
against himself.

01:45:18.777 --> 01:45:22.656
It doesn't seem to make sense,
but the prosecution isn't objecting so-

01:45:22.698 --> 01:45:24.366
No, I'm not. Let him continue.

01:45:24.616 --> 01:45:25.784
Shut up.

01:45:27.202 --> 01:45:30.622
Enough damage has been done.
I can't make it any worse.

01:45:30.789 --> 01:45:31.999
Yes, you can.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:36.128
All right. But you're on a very short leash.

01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:38.797
A very short leash.

01:45:39.047 --> 01:45:42.050
I will throw you in jail
for contempt myself.

01:45:42.968 --> 01:45:43.969
Now...

01:45:44.136 --> 01:45:46.805
...let's get this goddamn show on the road.

01:45:50.392 --> 01:45:52.144
I think you're doing a great job.

01:45:54.396 --> 01:45:56.815
Mr. Young, stop playing with that!

01:46:00.235 --> 01:46:04.239
Now, do you or do you not wish
to continue testifying, Mr. Young?

01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:07.493
It's okay. He asked me the right question.

01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:10.329
Counselor, you may proceed.

01:46:13.499 --> 01:46:17.169
Mr. Young, did you and I not have
a conversation last Friday...

01:46:17.336 --> 01:46:20.506
...in which you told me you wished
to change your plea to guilty?

01:46:20.839 --> 01:46:22.466
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:23.842 --> 01:46:26.595
I want to change my plea.
That's what I said.

01:46:26.762 --> 01:46:30.557
I'm going to ask you the single
most important question I can ask you.

01:46:30.599 --> 01:46:32.434
It's what this whole trial's about.

01:46:32.935 --> 01:46:35.854
Are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:38.565
I want to change my plea to guilty.
I said that.

01:46:38.607 --> 01:46:41.819
I didn't ask what you wanted to do.
I asked if you are guilty.

01:46:41.902 --> 01:46:42.736
Objection!

01:46:42.778 --> 01:46:44.571
He's badgering the witness.

01:46:44.613 --> 01:46:47.449
- He's my witness, for Christ's sake!
- I'm not your nothing!

01:46:47.533 --> 01:46:50.619
If the accused wants to enter
a plea of guilty-

01:46:50.953 --> 01:46:54.873
Silence! Mr. Stamphill,
you are skating on very thin ice here.

01:46:55.791 --> 01:46:59.002
Maybe, Your Honor,
but I'd like to get to the other side.

01:47:00.796 --> 01:47:02.965
Very well. You may proceed...

01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:05.134
...at your own peril.

01:47:05.217 --> 01:47:06.135
Thank you.

01:47:09.805 --> 01:47:12.141
Let me take this one step at a time.

01:47:15.144 --> 01:47:17.896
We had a conversation in which
I told you I felt...

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.940
...with the way the trial was going...

01:47:19.982 --> 01:47:24.444
...the most you'd have to face, more than
likely, would be another ten years or less.

01:47:24.736 --> 01:47:27.156
- I don't care-
- Ten years, that's what I said.

01:47:27.239 --> 01:47:28.740
Yeah, yeah, but-

01:47:28.907 --> 01:47:30.659
Did you say to me...

01:47:30.826 --> 01:47:34.079
...you were the guy who had to do
the time, not me?

01:47:34.246 --> 01:47:37.458
That they'd stick you back in Alcatraz
for those ten years, right?

01:47:37.499 --> 01:47:40.586
That's what I told you.
Why are you doing this to me?

01:47:40.752 --> 01:47:44.590
Because if you change your plea to guilty,
they will execute you.

01:47:44.756 --> 01:47:46.925
- You will die!
- So fucking what?

01:47:47.176 --> 01:47:49.344
I'd rather die than go back there!

01:48:02.107 --> 01:48:03.358
What'd you say?

01:48:03.525 --> 01:48:04.526
I said...

01:48:06.195 --> 01:48:09.698
...I'd rather die than go back there!
Can't you understand that?

01:48:10.699 --> 01:48:11.867
Why, Henri?

01:48:12.034 --> 01:48:13.785
Why do you want to die?

01:48:14.286 --> 01:48:15.621
Because...

01:48:17.456 --> 01:48:18.707
Because I'm...

01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:22.127
...scared of them.

01:48:22.961 --> 01:48:25.380
I'm scared to go back there. I'm scared.

01:48:26.298 --> 01:48:28.133
I'm scared. I'm scared.

01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.512
- Objection! He's finished-
- I haven't finished anything!

01:48:32.137 --> 01:48:33.806
Henri, look at me.

01:48:34.139 --> 01:48:36.266
Henri, look at me. Look at me.

01:48:36.809 --> 01:48:40.312
You were right. You were right,
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

01:48:40.479 --> 01:48:43.524
I'm just talking to you right now.
Not the judge or the jury.

01:48:43.565 --> 01:48:46.735
If you want to die, we'll back you up.
But I swear to God...

01:48:46.819 --> 01:48:50.239
...I'll fight these bastards
so they'll never do this to anyone again.

01:48:50.322 --> 01:48:52.407
You're not going to die for nothing!

01:48:52.491 --> 01:48:53.951
The choice is yours.

01:48:55.244 --> 01:48:56.912
What do you want to do?

01:49:02.584 --> 01:49:04.586
I want to stop being afraid.

01:49:12.928 --> 01:49:14.012
All right.

01:49:49.131 --> 01:49:50.466
Henri Young...

01:49:52.968 --> 01:49:55.888
...are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

01:50:17.075 --> 01:50:18.494
I was the weapon...

01:50:19.995 --> 01:50:21.914
...but I ain't no killer.

01:50:24.583 --> 01:50:26.251
They're the murderers.

01:50:37.513 --> 01:50:40.140
Bailiff, you may remove the prisoner.

01:50:42.017 --> 01:50:44.436
Escort the prisoner to the holding room.

01:51:11.797 --> 01:51:16.093
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
you have received your instructions.</i>

01:51:16.301 --> 01:51:20.222
<i>You may find the defendant guilty
of involuntary manslaughter...</i>

01:51:20.305 --> 01:51:23.725
<i>...which carries with it a maximum penalty
of three years...</i>

01:51:24.059 --> 01:51:26.687
<i>...in which case the defendant
will be remanded...</i>

01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:29.398
<i>...to the custody of the warden of Alcatraz.</i>

01:51:30.357 --> 01:51:34.486
<i>Or you may find the defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree.</i>

01:51:35.571 --> 01:51:38.073
<i>Without a recommendation for mercy...</i>

01:51:38.157 --> 01:51:41.285
<i>...that verdict will carry with it
a sentence of death.</i>

01:52:30.876 --> 01:52:32.795
This court is now in session.

01:52:33.796 --> 01:52:37.007
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
how do you find?

01:52:37.883 --> 01:52:39.551
The defendant will rise.

01:52:41.804 --> 01:52:44.890
We, the jury,
find the defendant, Henri Young...

01:52:45.057 --> 01:52:47.559
...not guilty of first-degree murder...

01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:50.437
...and guilty only
of involuntary manslaughter.

01:52:50.479 --> 01:52:51.980
Order! Order!

01:52:52.481 --> 01:52:55.818
We would like permission to address
the court, if possible.

01:52:56.485 --> 01:52:57.736
Very well.

01:52:57.903 --> 01:53:02.199
We have this day signed a petition
which I would like to read to the court.

01:53:03.575 --> 01:53:07.496
"We would like the following to be read
into the record of this proceeding.

01:53:07.579 --> 01:53:10.833
"Though we know it will have
no legal or binding effect...

01:53:11.667 --> 01:53:14.586
"...we'd hope that it will have
a moral effect.

01:53:15.838 --> 01:53:20.175
"We, the members of the jury,
recommend the immediate investigation...

01:53:20.217 --> 01:53:22.636
"...by the proper federal authorities...

01:53:22.678 --> 01:53:25.889
"...of the federal penitentiary
known as Alcatraz.

01:53:26.598 --> 01:53:29.393
"We find this institution, its wardens...

01:53:29.852 --> 01:53:33.355
"...and associate warden,
guilty of crimes against humanity."

01:53:35.107 --> 01:53:36.275
Thank you.

01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:38.026
The jury is dismissed.

01:53:38.110 --> 01:53:40.070
This trial is concluded.

01:53:40.154 --> 01:53:43.198
All rise. The defendant is remanded
to the custody of Alcatraz.

01:53:44.533 --> 01:53:47.828
<i>News from San Francisco.
The Young trial concludes.</i>

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.789
<i>The Rock will be investigated
as Young is vindicated...</i>

01:53:50.873 --> 01:53:53.459
<i>...by a verdict of involuntary manslaughter.</i>

01:53:54.126 --> 01:53:56.503
<i>As I walked out of the courtroom
that day...</i>

01:53:56.795 --> 01:54:00.799
<i>...I did not fully realize how much
Henri and I had actually accomplished.</i>

01:54:00.883 --> 01:54:02.801
<i>It all just happened so fast.</i>

01:54:04.052 --> 01:54:06.263
I'll to be up to see you as often as I can.

01:54:06.346 --> 01:54:09.266
Then you can bring that Blanche back
for a second shot.

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:11.226
I'll see what I can do.

01:54:11.393 --> 01:54:12.728
No place like home.

01:54:12.811 --> 01:54:14.313
Henri, it's not over.

01:54:15.147 --> 01:54:18.650
I'm going to appeal to have you moved
to another prison.

01:54:18.817 --> 01:54:21.862
I'm going to file motions to have
your original case reopened.

01:54:21.904 --> 01:54:24.406
Henri and Jim, together again, huh?

01:54:24.573 --> 01:54:27.034
That's right. Henri and Jim,
together again.

01:54:27.743 --> 01:54:29.703
Henri and Jim, together again.

01:54:30.579 --> 01:54:32.080
I won, didn't I?

01:54:32.247 --> 01:54:34.541
I mean, I really did something.

01:54:34.875 --> 01:54:35.918
I won!

01:54:36.752 --> 01:54:38.587
That's right, you won.

01:54:40.923 --> 01:54:43.509
How many games was
DiMaggio's hitting streak?

01:54:43.675 --> 01:54:45.052
Fifty-four?

01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:46.762
No, I got you.

01:54:46.929 --> 01:54:48.764
It was 56, wasn't it?

01:54:52.684 --> 01:54:54.186
I'll see you soon!

01:54:55.604 --> 01:54:57.231
Take care of yourself.

01:55:14.414 --> 01:55:16.250
<i>The definition of victory is:</i>

01:55:16.792 --> 01:55:19.294
<i>"Success in any contest or struggle.</i>

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.798
<i>"An engagement ending in triumph."</i>

01:55:33.058 --> 01:55:36.645
<i>That was to be the last time
I was to see Henri Young alive.</i>

01:55:37.479 --> 01:55:41.567
<i>Before the court date was set for
an appeal, his body was found in a cell.</i>

01:55:42.401 --> 01:55:45.654
<i>He laid beneath a single word
he had scrawled with a rock:</i>

01:55:46.989 --> 01:55:48.157
<i>"Victory."</i>

01:55:49.658 --> 01:55:52.578
<i>Henri Young had taught me
the meaning of the word.</i>

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:07.176
<i>He was the only man that I have known
who gave more than he asked.</i>

01:56:07.426 --> 01:56:09.678
<i>All that he ever wanted was a friend.</i>

01:56:10.262 --> 01:56:14.099
<i>I will always remember him
as one of the best friends I have ever had.</i>

01:56:15.934 --> 01:56:18.520
<i>Unlike many men that live much longer...</i>

01:56:19.021 --> 01:56:21.190
<i>...Henri Young did not die in vain.</i>

01:56:22.774 --> 01:56:24.943
<i>In the end, he was not afraid.</i>

01:56:26.195 --> 01:56:28.280
<i>He lived and he died in triumph.</i>

01:56:31.116 --> 01:56:33.118
<i>If only we could all do that.</i>

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:44.046
Welcome home.

01:56:45.881 --> 01:56:47.382
I've missed you.

01:56:56.391 --> 01:56:57.976
You can beat me...

01:56:58.393 --> 01:57:02.105
...you can put me back in that hole,
whatever you want to do.

01:57:03.398 --> 01:57:05.150
It doesn't matter to me.

01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:08.070
Action:

01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:10.322
I won.

01:57:11.573 --> 01:57:12.866
Reaction:

01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:16.078
You can't ever take that away from me.

01:57:31.593 --> 01:57:33.387
Take him to the hole!

01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:58.871
<i>Charles Dickens once said
that solitary confinement was inhumane.</i>

01:57:59.455 --> 01:58:02.458
<i>Seven months later,
the Supreme Court agreed.</i>

01:58:02.958 --> 01:58:07.296
<i>And as a result of the facts brought out
in the trial of The People vs. Young...</i>

01:58:07.379 --> 01:58:10.299
<i>...the dungeons of Alcatraz
were closed forever.</i>

01:58:10.716 --> 01:58:14.386
<i>Associate Warden Glenn was brought up
on charges of mistreatment.</i>

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.557
<i>He was found guilty. He would never work
in the penal system again.</i>

01:58:19.433 --> 01:58:21.393
<i>I remained in private practice.</i>

01:58:22.394 --> 01:58:24.271
<i>I also became a baseball fan.</i>

01:58:26.148 --> 01:58:27.733
<i>You did it, Henri.</i>
