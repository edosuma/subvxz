I still don't understand.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.437
Well, first, I just hootenannied up a
biomechanical brainwave generator,

18:20.641 --> 18:23.520
and then I learned to operate a
stick shift with my beard...

18:23.728 --> 18:26.652
Okay, yeah, but why did you do it?

18:26.856 --> 18:30.611
Well, when you get to be an old feller
like me, nobody pays any attention

18:30.818 --> 18:34.368
to you anymore.
My own son hasn't visited me in months.

18:34.572 --> 18:38.042

with a 15-ton aquatic robot.

So did you ever talk to your son about
how you felt?

19:05.811 --> 19:09.736
No, sir, I got to work straight on the
robot. I made lots of robots in my clay.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.319
Like when my wife left me and I
created a homicidal Pterodactyl-tron

19:13.527 --> 19:16.326

retirement party, and I constructed an

wanna hang out with is right here.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.210
Save your sympathy. I've been having
a great time without you,

20:03.411 --> 20:07.757

I had a run-in with the lake police.

I guess I gotta wear this ankle-bracelet
now, so that'll be fun.

for three more?

thread a hook with my eyes closed?
