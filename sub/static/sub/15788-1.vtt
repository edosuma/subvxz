05:16.080 --> 05:18.651
You just have such beautiful skin.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.490
I'm Ruby, by the way.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.723
Do you have a name,
or you want me to guess?

05:37.080 --> 05:39.526
- Jesse.
- Jesse.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.887
And you just got to LA, Jesse?

05:48.440 --> 05:50.090
How did you know?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.290
You've got that look.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.788
No, I do makeup.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.794

06:30.757 --> 06:33.046
At a motel in Pasadena.

06:34.928 --> 06:35.929
Mmm-hmm.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.076
What do your parents think about that?

06:40.634 --> 06:41.942
They don't really.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.450
Don't think, or just don't care?

06:52.312 --> 06:54.451
They're not around anymore.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.485
I'm sorry.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.998
Hey, You wanna go somewhere?

07:11.831 --> 07:13.310
Where?

07:14.734 --> 07:16.304
A party.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.649

08:45.592 --> 08:46.593
What?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.906
That's what it's called.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.772
They say women are
more likely to buy a lipstick

08:51.865 --> 08:55.108

What about me?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.806
Are you food

09:34.107 --> 09:37.782
or are you sex?

09:39.979 --> 09:44.121

10:23.356 --> 10:25.597
Is this your natural color?

10:27.360 --> 10:31.206
You are just so beautiful.
Don't you think that she's just perfect?

She's still a little sensitive.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.053

10:48.982 --> 10:51.394
You say that like it's a bad thing.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.725

11:23.683 --> 11:25.094
Do you have other family?

No.

11:48.875 --> 11:49.876
What?

11:50.743 --> 11:52.916
Isn't that what everyone wants to know?

11:53.580 --> 11:56.288
A pretty new girl walks into a room,
everyone's head turns,

11:56.416 --> 11:58.453
looks her up and down, wondering,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.053
"Who is she fucking?

"Who could she fuck?

"And how high can she climb,
and is it higher than me?"

I don't... I don't know.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.972
I just got to town,
so I don't know anybody here.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.479
Right. But you've slept with men before.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.481
You do sleep with men, don't you?

12:26.479 --> 12:27.651
All the time.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.663
I think I will get back to the party.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.599
Not really or no?

17:13.432 --> 17:14.775
No.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.375
It was just some guy, he found me online.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.951
Be careful with that.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.425
You're very fit.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.583
Thank you.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.858
You're also very young.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.922
I think you're perfect.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.700
I would never say you're fat.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.538
But that doesn't mean
that someone else won't.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.628
Understand?

17:45.464 --> 17:48.809
I see 20 or 30 girls
come in here every day.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.208
Mostly from small towns with big dreams

17:52.939 --> 17:55.146
because some guy named Chad
in the food court told them

17:55.274 --> 17:57.811
they were beautiful enough to be a model.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.979
And they're all good.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.089
Jack MacArthur is in town. Do you know him?

18:35.181 --> 18:36.592
No.

18:36.682 --> 18:37.820
Get to know him.

18:39.185 --> 18:43.509
I had to pull some strings,
but I sent him your Polaroids,

18:43.589 --> 18:45.865
and he has agreed to do a test with you.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.428
How does that sound?

18:49.695 --> 18:50.935
It sounds great.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.531
It sounds...

18:53.432 --> 18:54.706
Sounds good.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.611
Well, there's just a teensy bit
of paperwork.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.128
I'll need a copy of your drivers license
and a voided check,

19:02.208 --> 19:03.881
and I can take those right now.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.120
When did you graduate from high school?

19:15.187 --> 19:17.861
I'm actually still kind of working on it.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.138
I need a parental consent form.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.052
You can go.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.152
Parental consent form.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.593
Just one signature there
for parental consent.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.596
One little signature and we're off.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.837
When someone asks,
I want you to say you are 19.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.016
Always 19.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.905
Eighteen is too on the nose.

- No, you first.

Makes being a person down on Earth
feel really small.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.371
You could feel small here, too.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.207
Do you?

23:24.703 --> 23:25.875
Sometimes.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.984
When I was a kid,

23:30.809 --> 23:33.289
I would sneak out onto the roof at night.

23:35.814 --> 23:39.819
I thought the moon
looked like a big round eye.

23:42.154 --> 23:45.135
And I would look up and I'd say,

23:45.658 --> 23:47.638
"Do you see me?"

23:50.062 --> 23:52.133
I would stay out there for hours.

23:53.399 --> 23:56.403
Sometimes I'd fall asleep just dreaming.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.179
About what?

24:04.009 --> 24:05.420
What I would be.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.424
What was that?

24:09.682 --> 24:11.355
I could never figure it out.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.940
I can't sing. I can't dance.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.009

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:53.189
Sit down.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.852
I don't think there's room for two.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.598
That's all right,
we can just sit over there.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.762

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.773

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.131
And so on and so forth.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.465
Wow!

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.456
Did you always wanna be an actor?

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.959
Well, performing always
came naturally to me

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:28.805
because I'm a creator.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:31.729
All right? I build, I make.
It's in my blood.

01:06:31.855 --> 01:06:36.531
So whether I'm designing a collection
or creating a character,

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:38.895
it's all the same, right?

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:43.386
- I went out for a film last week.
- Oh, yeah, how did it go?

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:45.810
They said my face didn't match my voice.

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:48.075
- Well, you can fix your face.
- No, don't do that.

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.239
Why not?

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:53.582
Because you can always tell
when beauty is manufactured.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.316
And if you aren't born beautiful,
you never will be.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:59.169
- That's terrible.
- No, it's true.

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:00.751
I don't think you can always tell.

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:03.989
Dean,

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:08.097
we're having a little debate over here,
and we need your expertise.

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:10.599
Okay.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:13.349
You know Gigi, right?

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:14.931
Well, I mean, we just met.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:18.336
Will you stand up so that
he can take a look at you?

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.435
Go on, stand up.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.178
Well?

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:30.116
Well, what?

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:33.023
What do you think?
Do you think she is beautiful?

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.693
I don't know, I mean...

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.193
Yeah, I guess she's fine.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:42.361
Yes, yes. That's exactly the word
that I was looking for.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.131
She's fine, right?

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.535
You can sit down now, thanks.

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:47.969
Thank you, Dean.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.901
Now look at Jesse.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:56.083
Nothing fake, nothing false.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.816
A diamond in a sea of glass.

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:06.885
True beauty is the highest
currency we have.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.155
Now, without it, she would be nothing.

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:13.994
DEAN: I think you're wrong.

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:15.992
Excuse me.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.599
I said, I think you're wrong.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:24.420
So are you gonna tell me that
it's what's inside that counts?

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.343
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:30.517
Well, I think

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.011
that if she wasn't beautiful,

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.752
you wouldn't have even stopped to look.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:49.359

It's the only thing.
