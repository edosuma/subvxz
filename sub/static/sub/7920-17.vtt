How's the planning of
the bachelor party coming?

00:03.171 --> 00:04.838
Well, Tokyo is not happening.
Turns out Nick booked the trip

00:05.240 --> 00:08.307
on a Web site called
Pricelive.cob.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.543
Right.
That's a scam.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.011
Yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure of it.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.213
I-I'm still pulling
for a Tokyo theme.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.182
You know, we could
do a spa day.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.950
There could be
hot springs,

00:18.952 --> 00:20.585
cherry blossoms.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.529
I don't why I led out
with "let's" like that.

07:11.531 --> 07:12.997
I feel like I have
nowhere to...

07:12.999 --> 07:15.233
Let's rodeo.

07:18.004 --> 07:21.005
♪ I'm ready to get mine ♪

07:21.007 --> 07:24.142
♪ Then I'll leave this town... ♪

07:24.144 --> 07:26.344
Oh, these people are real desert-y.
I don't think

07:26.346 --> 07:27.979
this is the kind of place
where you're gonna want to s...

07:27.981 --> 07:28.546
(loud thud)

07:28.548 --> 07:30.648
(muttering)

07:30.650 --> 07:33.218
Somebody watch that.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.821
I must say, this is
not my favorite

07:36.823 --> 07:38.489
sort of white
people in here.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.858
Me neither.
My favorite kind

07:39.860 --> 07:41.726
of white people are
redheads with high socks.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.328
Male or female.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.163
Hey, hey.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.532
Um, remember earlier,
when you took my phone

07:47.534 --> 07:48.900
and it went "ding"?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.668
Wait a minute.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.669
There's a desert flower
over there

07:51.671 --> 07:53.171
who needs
a little watering.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.239
(grunts)

07:55.842 --> 07:57.242
What's Schmidt doing?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.744
(thud)

07:59.746 --> 08:02.247
Oh, he's not even
looking at the buttons.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.514
♪ I used to bite my tongue ♪

08:03.516 --> 08:04.883
♪ And hold my breath ♪

08:04.885 --> 08:06.551
Hey, what's going on?
Come here.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.886
Unplug the thing.
Unplug the whole thing.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.920
♪ So I sit quiet... ♪

08:08.922 --> 08:10.889
(music stops)
Whoa.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.524
(chuckles)
Good thing that's over.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.393
We can come back from this.
Buy everybody in here a drink.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.730
That's a cool move.
That's a Rat Pack move.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.565
Can I buy you a drink?

08:20.567 --> 08:22.267
Um, uh, a beer?
A bock, maybe?

08:22.269 --> 08:24.535
You've got some amber
in-in your necklace.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.070
Uh, maybe an amber bock.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.540
Nick?

08:29.542 --> 08:31.009
(dog barking outside)

08:35.582 --> 08:37.249
Nick?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.917
I got to tell you,
I love that vest.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.252
Desert fashion has a certain

08:41.254 --> 08:43.621
functional sensuality
that I really respond to.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.757
I made it out of
my dead Rottweiler.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.392
You dirty little rattlesnake.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.760
You know, I've got
a picnic blanket

08:48.762 --> 08:50.461
in my minivan,
we could go... (yells)

08:50.463 --> 08:52.430
You know what? If you're gonna
be traveling in my minivan,

08:52.432 --> 08:53.464
you're gonna live by my rules.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.433
Now go over there and sit down.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.068
You know, I'm willing
to bet, you got

08:57.070 --> 08:58.770
a big spider in your hair.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.104
When I come back,

09:00.106 --> 09:02.573
I intend to find it.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.575
I'm not mad.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.611
I'm just incredibly
disappointed in you.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.780
Five whiskeys, please.
BARTENDER: Coming up.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.416
You're doing them all. That's
too much whiskey for my frame.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.284
No, no, I know
it seems like a lot,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.153
but binge drinking can be a fun

09:15.155 --> 09:17.655
and safe way
to engage with life.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.490
This is one of
your dear friend's

09:19.492 --> 09:20.758
bachelor parties, you know?

09:20.760 --> 09:22.427
If you miss out on it now,

09:22.429 --> 09:24.595
you miss out
on the memories forever, Wally.

09:24.597 --> 09:28.433
My name's Winston, but
you're absolutely correct, man.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.101
I should not be sitting here,
thinking about Aly.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.936
She's never going to
go for a guy like me.

09:31.938 --> 09:34.605
Clearly living
in a fantasy world.

09:34.607 --> 09:37.141
I should be getting
drunk with you guys

09:37.143 --> 09:39.010
in this disgusting bar.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.111
(laughter)

09:40.113 --> 09:41.479
Hear, hear.
Cheers to that.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.949
Oh, that is low quality whiskey.
Yeah.

09:44.951 --> 09:45.984
Hey, barkeep.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.986
Let me get a whiskey on ice.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.487
(slams table)

09:51.825 --> 09:52.991
What? What'd I say?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.659
Did he say something
about ice?

09:54.661 --> 09:55.893
Where are you boys from?

09:56.696 --> 09:58.963
I'm from Los Angeles.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.298
East side.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.166
The... more... uh...
east... east downtown.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.302
Big city boys trying
to come to our desert

10:04.304 --> 10:06.137
and freeze the little
water we got left.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.339
'Cause you're too soft
for a hot whiskey.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.541
No-no one's bad mouthing
hot whiskey.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.510
Hot Whiskey was
my first chat room name.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.178
Who wants a drink?

10:14.180 --> 10:15.980
I'll take a nice warm glass

10:15.982 --> 10:18.516
of how about you stop coming
over here and using our water

10:18.518 --> 10:20.485
to hydrate your daisies
over in L.A.?!

10:20.487 --> 10:21.886
Okay, first of all,
let me just say,

10:21.888 --> 10:24.355
I think we're all concerned

10:24.357 --> 10:26.324
about the drought in California.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.358
I haven't showered in six days.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.060
Oh, so you're saying
you want to fight.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.529
That's a huge
leap in logic.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.064
You want to fight?
Yeah.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.499
I'll fight you and then
I'll take a hot shower,

10:34.501 --> 10:36.234
you s-sandy lizard man.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.202
Let's do this. Totally, totally,
totally, totally, totally.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.704
Yeah, let's fight these guys, Nick.
Yeah, totally.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.239
We're gonna
fight these guys.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.008
Uh, but not indoors.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.510
Because real men
fight outside.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.879
Yeah, just like real
chili doesn't have beans.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.547
What the hell
you just say about beans?

10:49.549 --> 10:52.383
Beans are nothing
but soggy nuts.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.885
What the hell
are you saying about nuts?!

10:53.887 --> 10:55.019
Nothing, it's a totally
weird digression.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.054
It's not what we're about.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.688
We'll see you outside.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.525
But first we got to go to
the little boys' room together.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.760
Yeah, we're gonna urinate
and then we're gonna do this.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.195
Yeah.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.997
Uh, is there a key?
Do I need a key to the restroom?

11:11.604 --> 11:14.205
Ooh, God, I hope I get to
kick somebody in the head.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.440
What are you doing
with that window?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.909
You letting a bee out?
That's dope, man.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.411
N-N-N-N-N-No. We're escaping. We're
not fighting those guys. What?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.547
I thought you s-said that we're going
to meet them outside? Uh, yeah.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.082
And they believed it.
It's a great trick.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.917
It's how the Millers have
never had to pay for a ham.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.752
We're escaping?
How-how is that butch, Nick?

11:27.754 --> 11:29.220
Enough with the butch stuff,
Schmidt.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.089
You got to let
this Toby thing go.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.624
If I freaked out every time
somebody yelled at me, I...

11:33.626 --> 11:35.226
It's not because
I got yelled at.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.395
It's because I got yelled at
in front of Cece.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.431
You know, I know she
can handle herself,

11:40.433 --> 11:42.934
but I need to prove to myself
that I can defend her

11:42.936 --> 11:45.403
from the lunatic pagans
of the world.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.604
Because if I can't,

11:46.606 --> 11:48.606
what kind of husband
am I going to be?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.608
I understand if
you don't want

11:50.610 --> 11:52.410
any part of this,

11:52.412 --> 11:54.245
but this is something
I have to do.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.682
For me.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.086
(sighs)

12:02.088 --> 12:04.155
Okay. I'm in.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.290
If you got to do it,
then I got your back.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.592
There's two of them,
there's two of us.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.893
We can do this.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.997
They got a lot of
rings, Schmidty.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.145
We are so outnumbered.
So outnumbered.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.246
We're not going
to win this fight.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.983
That's a little boy
over there.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.317
Where'd that little
boy come from?

12:33.319 --> 12:35.153
He just does
that sometimes.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.588
All right, I'll take
the little boy.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.923
I'm gonna take the little boy.
I got the little boy.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.124
You take everybody else.
I got the boy.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.325
I'm gonna go for
the little boy.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.527
You're not
touching Dirt Boy.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.794
Don't touch Dirt Boy.

12:43.796 --> 12:44.896
Dirt Boy touches you.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.000
Why did you not more
forcefully talk me out of this?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.169
Why is that little boy
not in a day care?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.236
Are we fighting or not?

12:56.009 --> 12:56.908
What are we gonna do?

13:02.348 --> 13:03.381
We gotta do something, Schmidt.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.885
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

13:08.721 --> 13:10.021
What are you doing?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.189
I'm being a man.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.190
I'm Schmidt!

13:12.192 --> 13:13.324
Schmidt!

13:13.326 --> 13:16.694
Yeah, I'm Schmidt! Schmidt!

13:16.696 --> 13:18.362
Why does he keep saying his name?
I'm Schmidt.

13:18.364 --> 13:19.664
In case you're
wondering what my n...

13:19.666 --> 13:20.731
...what my name is,
it's Schmidt.

13:20.733 --> 13:21.832
Schmidt!

13:21.834 --> 13:23.668
This is Nick!
Nick! Schmidt!

13:23.670 --> 13:26.904
You know what
would be a good plan?

13:26.906 --> 13:29.707
You get a job at
a Raisin Bran factory, right?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.008
You start stealing

13:31.010 --> 13:33.044
all of the raisins, okay?
You follow?

13:33.046 --> 13:34.512
Then you hydrate those raisins

13:34.514 --> 13:36.247
to make them turn
back into grapes,

13:36.249 --> 13:38.015
and you sell the grapes.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.918
There's no overhead, and you
make you a very rich man.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.753
That's right, Wilson.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.422
You have surrendered
to the night.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.057
I'm Wilson.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.592
Schmidt!
Yeah, I'm Schmidt!

13:48.228 --> 13:49.560
My babies.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.862
Ain't nobody gonna
touch my babies.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.431
(whooping)

13:53.433 --> 13:54.765
Knuckle up!

13:54.767 --> 13:56.234
Yeah, I'm feeling dangerous!
No, no, no.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.935
Winston. Winston. No.
Uh-huh!

13:57.937 --> 13:59.437
I ain't got no phone.
I ain't got no Aly.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.571
No, no, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.107
Dirt bike push. (yells)

14:03.109 --> 14:04.542
Winston.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.711
Mirror kick. (yells)

14:06.713 --> 14:08.879
Hey, hey, that's my car!
Okay, get him!

14:08.881 --> 14:10.248
That's his car?
You didn't say that was his car.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.216
We got this. We got this. We got this.
We got this.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.618
(distorted):
Come on!

14:13.620 --> 14:17.788

in distance)

15:52.785 --> 15:54.952
(grunts)

15:54.954 --> 15:57.121
I think some turquoise
got stuck in there.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.490
Here. That hurt?
Ow.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.791
Yes, a little.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.959
All right. Let's do this.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.327
Doggies or trucks?

16:03.329 --> 16:05.563
I don't deserve trucks.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.332
I'll be the judge of that.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.201
You deserve trucks.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.572
Damn. Anybody else
get hit with a geode?

16:14.574 --> 16:15.973
I got hit with a geode.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.908
Some dude stuck his
fingers in my mouth.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.478
What is that? Is that
like a desert power thing?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.979
When things started
escalating, I just rolled up

16:21.981 --> 16:23.914
into a little ball
like an armadillo.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.584
Fellas,
can I get real for a second?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.755
I was thinking
about Aly the entire time.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.825
This is one of her barrettes.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.262
You know, women use barrettes

16:38.264 --> 16:40.998
to keep their hairs in
different styles. Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.601
And Aly uses this to pin
her hair up when she's on duty.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.202
And I kept it.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.505
(chuckles)
That's how pathetic I am.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.606
That's not pathetic.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.541
It's lovely.

16:50.543 --> 16:54.278
It reminds me of all
my old lost loves.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.182
Yeah. Cece.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.184
Or my ex.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.685
She was a pill,

17:01.687 --> 17:04.021
but when she used to go
to second base on me,

17:04.023 --> 17:06.757
she was like Joe Morgan.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.628
You know, a lot of people
don't know this,

17:10.630 --> 17:15.032
but, uh,
Aly's full name is Alison.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.470
I like to imagine that she
was named after the song.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.439

17:36.489 --> 17:38.389
Sorry I got us
into this, Nick.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.890
I was useless out there.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.225
I didn't even get
one punch in.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.893
That's not true.
You hit me a little bit.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.562
I got my ass whomped out there.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.064
Got whomped up
and down the road.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.066
What's whomp?
Like a whomp-down.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.768
Oh, whooped?
Whomped.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.936
Are you talking
about getting beat up?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.571
Yes.
Whooped.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.772
I got this calendar bod,

17:54.774 --> 17:56.407
but it doesn't
hold up in battle.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.075
Look, it's 2016.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.077
She's not looking
for a strong husband.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.179
That... no, tha-that's
not what I was gonna...

18:02.181 --> 18:03.581
That's not where
I was going with this.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.517
I'm getting married, Nick.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.452
How am I going
to defend Cece?

18:08.454 --> 18:10.688
She deserves the best
husband in the world,

18:10.690 --> 18:13.190
and what if I don't
have what it takes?

18:13.192 --> 18:17.428
Of course you have what it
takes to be a modern husband.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.264
Do you have what it takes to be
a husband of the old world?

18:20.266 --> 18:21.599
God, no.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.101
They would use you as a pelt.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.004
Today, you fought, kinda.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.273
You're gonna make
a great husband to Cece.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.941
How do you know?
Because I know.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.810
Because why?
Because.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.645
Look what happened here today.
Because why?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.947
Beca... ever since I've
known you, you've been there.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.449
Okay, you're always there.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.818
Even when I don't want
you there, you're there.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.387
That's what a husband does.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.956
You fight for me.
That's what a husband does.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.124
You care about what I eat.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.792
That's what a husband does.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.294
You've cooked for me,
even when I don't ask.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.962
That's what a husband does.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.498
When I pass out, you comb my
hair so there's no knots in it.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.833
That's what a husband does.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.301
So, guess what.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.469
You're gonna be a great
husband to Cece because

18:58.471 --> 19:01.472
you're a great husband to me.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.140
So that's how I know.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.341
You're, you're
like my husband.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.010
You're like my wife, but...

19:06.012 --> 19:07.978
Yeah, so that's how I know.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.149
Thanks for saying that, man.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.751
Yeah, man.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.997
(gagging, coughing)

19:33.172 --> 19:35.506
I need this to be done, okay?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.609
Well, you can't take it back.
I heard you say it, Nick.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.844
(deep voice): Hey, hey, hey.
What you guys up to?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.780
We're pouring out one
for our lost loves.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.349
Good-bye, unrequited
love for Aly.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.185
May I now heal and,
and move forward.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.387
I'm proud of you, man.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.190
And as a gift, I'm gonna give
you your own property back.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.526
You don't have to do that.
I mean, it's not...

19:55.528 --> 19:57.127
I don't really need it, but...

19:57.129 --> 19:58.762
Whoa.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.366
Aly is single.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.302
Aly is single! Nice! Oh, great.

20:05.304 --> 20:06.737
Hey.
Hey.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.238
Okay, so are you gonna
tell her how you feel?

20:08.240 --> 20:09.373
I don't know. I don't know, uh,

20:09.375 --> 20:10.407
I don't know, I mean,

20:10.409 --> 20:11.542
what if she doesn't
like me back?

20:11.544 --> 20:12.710
What if I'm not
good enough for her?

20:12.712 --> 20:13.877
What if I can't bear her sons?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.112
You have to try.
Look, I didn't think

20:15.114 --> 20:17.081
I was good enough for Cece.
You aren't.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.549
Winston, I don't know how
this is going to work out,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.551
but you need to know
that you're good enough.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.553
You got a heart of gold.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.155
You got a smile that...
(groaning)

20:25.157 --> 20:27.257
He's been having some
really nice moments today

20:27.259 --> 20:28.559
and then kind of freaking out.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.827
You son of a bitch!

20:29.829 --> 20:31.762
So, what, you guys think
I should tell her how I feel?

20:31.764 --> 20:33.230
Yes. You absolutely should.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.398
Let's go now.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.566
What about your bachelor party?

20:35.568 --> 20:36.900
Who could want
anything more

20:36.902 --> 20:38.602
from a bachelor party
than their best friend

20:38.604 --> 20:40.904
telling him that they love him.
No. For real? You said that?

20:40.906 --> 20:42.573
I didn't tell him that I love
him. Let's be clear about that.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.074
I missed that?
You know what?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.275
I'm gonna tell Cece
how I feel about her.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.610
I'm gonna get her back.

20:46.612 --> 20:47.611
You do that, bud--
wait, wait.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.746
BOTH:
What?

20:48.748 --> 20:49.747
You guys go on ahead without me.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.015
I'm gonna hang back here

20:51.017 --> 20:53.083
for another round
with my desert queen.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.754
Besides, there's nothing
for me in the city.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.256
Wait a second. Don't you
have two kids? Yeah.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.758
I'll be back Sunday.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.925
I got to pick them up
from swim camp.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.427
Good luck, fellas.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.639
We should go now.
Let's do it.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.975
We're men.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no. I'm good.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.948
Men. We're men.
