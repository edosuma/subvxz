- Hey, Daphne.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.300
- Hey, Niles.
- Come on in.

00:11.500 --> 00:15.200
Is Frasier here? I need him to approve
the latest version of his bio.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.000
Why does he keep updating his bio?
What's changed in the last few years?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.400
Oh. His date of birth.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.000
He's now four years younger
than I am.

00:27.300 --> 00:30.000
Well, that's silly.
Does everyone fake their age in radio?

00:31.100 --> 00:32.600
- No.
- Oh.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.200
Oh, Roz, please sit down.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.500
I'm glad you're here.
There's something we want to ask you.

[DAPHNE CLEARS THROAT]

00:40.300 --> 00:41.900
When Niles and I get married,

00:42.100 --> 00:45.300
it would make us very happy
if you would serve as maid of honour.

00:45.700 --> 00:46.700
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:46.900 --> 00:47.900
[GIGGLES]

00:48.200 --> 00:50.800

I don't know what to say.

- Oh, of course. Of course I'll do it.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.300
And now set aside September 1 st.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.600
Oh, is that Labour Day weekend?

00:59.700 --> 01:00.800
Yeah. Is that a problem?

01:00.900 --> 01:05.099
Well, there's this picnic I always go to,
and I make the potato salad.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.000
What am I saying?

01:07.200 --> 01:11.500
Your wedding is more important
than potato salad. Or any salad.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.900
Then it's settled.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.800
I'll make the potato salad
the night before,

01:15.100 --> 01:16.900
and I'll just get someone...

01:17.200 --> 01:18.900
I'll figure it out.

01:20.900 --> 01:21.900
- Hello, all.
ROZ: Hi.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.800
Look who's here.
It's my little brother Frasier.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.000
- I brought your new bio.
FRASIER: Oh, yes.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.100
I'll deal with that tomorrow, Roz.
I gotta be cross town in half an hour.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.300
I'm previewing
the new Benjamin Locklear exhibit,

01:32.600 --> 01:34.500
then I'm having dinner
with the artist afterward.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.300
It promises to be
a very exciting evening.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.400
And what lucky lady
are you sharing it with?

01:38.700 --> 01:39.800
Well, I'm going alone.

- Oh, I'm sorry.
FRASIER: Don't be.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Truth is, I'm a pretty terrific date.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.400
Yes. I know when to arrive,
I know when to call it a night,

01:48.800 --> 01:51.400
and, frankly,
I always leave myself wanting more.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.600
Oh, it's too bad Dr. Crane
doesn't have anyone

01:57.900 --> 02:00.200
- to share these things with.
- I know.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.100
When was the last time
he seriously dated anyone?

02:03.400 --> 02:06.500
Well, that would be Claire,
but that was months ago.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.400
We should set him up
with someone.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.699
Well, it seems to me
he's choosing not to date.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.900
I have this friend at yoga
he might like.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.400
No, she sounds flaky.
I have the perfect person for him.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.700
Well, you know,
he's always been completely capable

02:20.000 --> 02:21.400
of meeting people on his own.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.700
No. We should go with my person first.
You don't have the best track record.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.300
Me? Whenever you've set me up
with guys,

02:27.500 --> 02:29.900
I knew they were losers
the second I saw them.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.400
Turned out to be bad in bed too.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.700
Well, there's no reason we both
can't try to set him up with someone.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.400
Okay. But we have to find someone
who's gorgeous, sexy and smart.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.700
Smart's good,
but I'm not a fanatic about it.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.600
It's not for you. It's for Dr. Crane.

02:48.900 --> 02:52.400
Yes. Even though he's expressed
no dissatisfaction with his love life,

02:52.700 --> 02:55.300
these two have decided to make it
their mission to find him a mate.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.200
MARTIN:
It's not a bad idea.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.500
It's been a long time since
Frasier was excited about somebody.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.700
I kind of miss that spring in his step,
you know?

03:04.900 --> 03:06.100
The nervous energy he gets

03:06.400 --> 03:09.500
where every first date
might be the one.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.300
The electricity
of that 30-point self-inspection

03:13.500 --> 03:16.500
before he rolls out of the showroom.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.400
He says he's happy.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.200
Isn't that what
you would've said, too,

03:20.500 --> 03:22.200
before your brother
helped bring us together?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.600
That's my point exactly.
Let's start calling babes.

DAPHNE:
Yeah. Hee-hee.

03:31.100 --> 03:34.100
Aah. What about Caroline?
She'd get along great with your brother.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
Is she the one missing a tooth?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.300
She had it replaced.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.000
That dental school
did a good job too.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.000
You can only tell it's fake
under a black light.

What about Jennifer?

03:49.100 --> 03:51.600
She's pretty, smart,
she has those perky breasts.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.900
Huh.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.700
Wouldn't call them perky
so much as...

03:57.300 --> 03:59.500
Don't remember Jennifer.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.400
Well, besides,
didn't Frasier already go out with her?

She even owns a bookstore.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.900
You've been holding out on me.

04:24.100 --> 04:28.100
Well, she's a former patient,
so that's kind of an ethical grey area.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.000
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
setting her up with Frasier.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.300
Well, what if she didn't know
you were setting her up?

04:33.600 --> 04:37.000
You could point her out to me,
and I could strike up a friendship.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.500
We could go out for coffee,
see movies, tell each other everything.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.100
Maybe I was a little hasty
in making Roz my maid of honour.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.700
As soon as she finds out
you're my fiancÃ©e, well,

04:52.100 --> 04:53.500
there's my ethical dilemma again.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.900
Well, what if they just happen
to meet by themselves?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
- Like at her bookstore?
- Exactly.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.300
Frasier is always going
to bookstores.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.900
She does own a bookstore.

05:08.100 --> 05:13.200
Over time, it's highly probable
he would find himself in her bookstore.

05:13.900 --> 05:19.000
Perhaps I could just place them
within range of one another.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.900
And I'd just stay out of sight.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.200
That'll do.

- Oh, that's admirable.

of all thought.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.400
Frasier knows pretty much everything
there is to know about wine.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.300
Tell us some things
about wine, Frasier.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.600
Sometimes you have to know
when to put a cork in it.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.600
- So, Roz, where's Roger?
- I don't know.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.900
I'll call him
and see what's holding him up.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.300
You know, Susanna,
now would be a good time

11:15.600 --> 11:17.700
to show Frasier your portfolio.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.600
- Susanna's an artist.
- Oh.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.300
She even has a gallery
that shows her paintings exclusively.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.800
It's not so much a gallery
as a restaurant-slash-bowling alley.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.700
She's a hell of a bowler too.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.100
Someone better snatch her up
before she joins a league

11:34.400 --> 11:37.100
and there go her Saturday nights.

11:39.300 --> 11:42.100
Roz, go make your call, all right?

11:42.900 --> 11:45.400
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.200
I don't usually travel with my portfolio,
but she made me bring it.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.000
I'm glad she did. I actually fancy myself
a bit of a collector.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.100
- I'd love to see it.
- Oh, all right.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.200
- But be gentle.
- Of course.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.600
Oh, my.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.200
Well, that is interesting.
It's quite remarkable, really.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.000
Thanks. The original's
hanging over the shoe rental.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.500
Wonderful texture.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.900
And these blues.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.500
So much sadness.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.100
Most people don't get that.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.800
Yes, and your elongated figures
are actually reminiscent of Modigliani.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.400
That's interesting.
I used to love Modigliani as a girl.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.100
Maybe I was
subconsciously influenced.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.300
Quite possibly, yes.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.600
I see you're also a fan
of Benjamin Locklear.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.600
- What?
- Benjamin Locklear has a show...

12:36.900 --> 12:39.800
I know who he is.
His stuff isn't anything like mine.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.900
Maybe you haven't seen
his latest work.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.300
You see, I was just in attendance
at his most recent opening.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.800
I purchased a fantastic piece myself.
Here, let me show you.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.600
Hmm?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.300
- My God.
- It's magnificent, isn't it?

12:53.600 --> 12:56.500
You know, I'm thinking of putting it
in my bedroom to set off the duvet.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.400
That hack ripped me off.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.800
- That's quite an accusation.
- The guy is a thief.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.500
Everyone in the art community
knows it.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.700
I consider myself a member
of the art community.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.800
- All I've heard is good things.
- Oh, please.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.600
The guy steals
from lesser-known artists

13:08.800 --> 13:11.200
and markets himself to suckers
with more money than taste.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.300
You know what?

13:19.500 --> 13:21.000
You're right.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.300
Maybe he did copy you.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.300
Maybe he got
his inspiration one evening

13:25.400 --> 13:28.900
when he was out bowling
a few frames.

13:29.300 --> 13:33.200
I do not need to be insulted
by someone who buys art

13:33.600 --> 13:35.500
because it matches his bedspread.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.400
It's a duvet, and you're delusional.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.000
- Dilettante.
- Forger.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.300
Man who uses the word "duvet."

13:45.900 --> 13:47.800
Hey, guys, how's it going?

13:48.300 --> 13:50.900
- She is crazy, that's how it's going.
- And for your information,

13:51.200 --> 13:55.200
Benjamin Locklear
is as overrated as your ass.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.800
- What was that supposed to mean?
- I have no idea. Have a nice weekend.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.900
- What's going on out here?
- Oh.

14:06.500 --> 14:10.300
I let Roz set me up on a blind date
with one of her friends.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.000
Big waste of time, huh?

14:12.300 --> 14:14.900
- Well, there's pie.
- Ooh.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.000
- Homemade?
- Yep.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.700
- Cherry?
- Key lime.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.500
I can live with that.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.500
Sorry, son. Tough break.

14:24.700 --> 14:28.000
Oh, I bet it's got a lard crust. Ooh.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.500
- Brought you a fork, Dad.
- Oh, thanks.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
I wish I'd never let Roz set me up
on that date.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.700
Well, you know, you can't hit the ball
unless you take a swing. Oh.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Now, there's this gal
at the building where I work.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.100
Dad. You're not proposing
another blind date.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.800
Now, she's a beautiful young lawyer,
and she couldn't be nicer.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.100
- I am not interested.
- Well, now, don't say that.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.900
- You gotta see her.
- Dad...

14:52.100 --> 14:53.700
Frasier, listen to me.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.700
You gotta see her.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.200
A young lawyer, you say?

15:07.100 --> 15:09.400
KRIS: Thanks for meeting me here.
- Sure.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.600
I thought it would be nice
to have a drink before dinner.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.800
I don't think
I've ever really been here before,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.300
but it does have
a nice sort of neighbourhood feel to it.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.000
It is my favourite place.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.200
Ah.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.600
So my dad tells me
that you're a lawyer.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.800
Actually, I'm a legal secretary,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.800
but I'm planning
to go to law school next fall.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.700
Well, that's admirable. Thank you.

15:30.500 --> 15:35.100
Of course, you know, paradoxically,
you'll have to pass the bar

15:35.500 --> 15:38.300
if you expect to pass the bar.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:38.700 --> 15:39.900
You're so funny.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.900
- Hey, Kris.
KRIS: Hey, Clint.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.800
Nice to see you.
Hey, that's a great sweater.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.100
Oh, thank you.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.400
So, uh, what did my dad
tell you about me?

15:54.700 --> 15:57.300
- Oh, he talks about you all the time.
- Really?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.200
Yes, he's very proud of you.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
[LAUGHS]

16:00.800 --> 16:03.800
But what he didn't tell me
is how good-looking you are.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.000

Thanks, Graham.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.100
- So you know him?
- Oh, you know.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.900
JASON: Hey, you.
- Hey.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.100
Wouldn't mind stopping
and smelling those roses.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.900
- Oh. You are so funny.
- Ha-ha-ha.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.800
Jason, this is Frasier.
Frasier, Jason.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.700
- Nice to meet you.
- So you owe me a pool game.

16:33.900 --> 16:37.200
- Another time.
- Oh, sounds like somebody's scared.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.800
Yeah, you.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.300
- Scared of getting your ass kicked.
- Uh-huh.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.300
But it'll have to be another time.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.700
I'm on a date.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.800
Frasier doesn't mind.
You don't mind, do you?

16:47.100 --> 16:48.500
- Well, actually...
- Thanks, champ.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.300
I'll be right back.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.400
- Mind if I break?
- Sure. Go ahead.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.800
- Ugh. Looks like you're stripes.
- Yep, and you are definitely solid.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.400
- Oh, shut up.
- I got next game.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.400
I'm after Graham.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.900
So

17:09.200 --> 17:11.300
how do you know Kris?

17:11.500 --> 17:14.099
Oh, you know.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.800
No, I really don't.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
HARRY:
I got her next.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.099
Oh, Kris, I got my car checked out.
You were right.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.700
It was the transmission.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.200
Then you owe me a pitcher.

- Who are you?
- I'm her date.

Well, oh, yeah, she's very pretty.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.200
And, uh... And nice.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.200
A little too nice, perhaps.

18:11.100 --> 18:15.500
Frasier, the table only takes quarters.
Would you get some change?

18:16.200 --> 18:18.800
You know, Kris, maybe we should
cancel our plans for tonight.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.900
What? Why?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.200
You're having such a good time
with your crowd here.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.800
No. I just have to teach this one guy
a lesson, then I'm all yours.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.200
I promise.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.300
Well, I guess I can ask the bartender
for some change.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.900
Oh, Smitty's too busy.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.200
But try next door at the dry cleaners.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.400
Tell them it's for me.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.900
Thanks for the tip.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.300
- You are so sweet.
- Ah.

Isn't Frasier sweet, guys?

[MEN LAUGHING]

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
I felt sure that Frasier
was gonna hit it off with Kris.

She's really popular at the office.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.800
Poor Dr. Crane.
I feel like we failed him.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.100

to throw in the towel.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.800
There's this woman
at the dog park...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.300
Well, if you're gonna try again,
we should try again too.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.000
Maybe Frasier had the right attitude
by leaving it up to fate.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.700
There's nothing wrong
with lending a helping hand.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Maybe we were destined
to fix him up with someone.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.400
I'm afraid
whatever we wanted for Frasier,

19:18.800 --> 19:20.800

Hi.

- Hi, Lisa.
- Oh, Andy.

- Can you get out spray paint?
- Well, how'd this happen?

19:41.700 --> 19:43.400
I was at
the new Benjamin Locklear exhibit,

19:43.700 --> 19:46.400
and this crazy woman came in
and started ranting

19:46.600 --> 19:48.300
about how he'd ripped off her work.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.500
And then she started
spray-painting everything.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.100
Actually, I don't know if I should clean it
or hold onto it till after she dies.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.300
You know, because art
increases in value after the artist...

20:02.200 --> 20:04.100

three quarters and a nickel.

any more quarters left.
