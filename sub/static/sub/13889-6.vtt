I understand you played an idiotic prank on
a senior and much-respected officer yesterday.

01:06.133 --> 01:09.694
That is not true. We played the prank
on Mr Ackerman, sir.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.306
- I mean Mr Ackerman.
- Oh, I see.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.065
What happened?

01:15.242 --> 01:20.270
We inserted a capsule of the truth serum
sodium Pentothal into his aspirin inhaler.

01:21.882 --> 01:27.115
Which is why he rushed onto the bridge
this morning, apologised for being late,

01:27.287 --> 01:31.587
saying he'd been having jiggy-jiggy
with the science officer's wife,

01:31.758 --> 01:35.990
and hadn't allowed enough time
to change out of his Batman outfit.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.362
Permission to snigger, sir.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.000
Permission refused.

01:43.170 --> 01:46.037
May have to snigger anyway, sir.

01:47.207 --> 01:50.643
- Do either of you have anything to say?
- About what, sir?

01:50.810 --> 01:55.747
About Mr Ackerman. About him being late
and wearing a Batman outfit.

01:55.916 --> 01:59.875
Has he considered being Tarzan?
Costume change would be much quicker.

02:01.955 --> 02:08.190
You two are both serving a two-year sentence
in the brig. Do you wanna get out ever?

02:08.360 --> 02:10.920
It's just that Mr Ackerman's so...

02:11.865 --> 02:14.095
...horrible, sir.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.360
I am not, sir!

02:17.204 --> 02:19.138
I'm extremely nice!

02:19.306 --> 02:21.433
Lovely, in fact.

02:21.608 --> 02:25.271
Warm, caring, but most of all, nice.

02:26.112 --> 02:31.516
Hence my nickname - Nicey Ackerman.
That's why I entered the service, sir -

02:31.685 --> 02:37.180
so I could share my sunny disposition with
inmate scum who didn't have my start in life.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.951
He's been horrible from the day we met him.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.151
Today, we have a new intake.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.060
To them I say, obey the rules,

02:46.233 --> 02:51.603
keep out of trouble, and your time here
will pass much more pleasantly.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.906
Welcome to floor 13.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.707
He seems like a nice guy.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.620
If you want to speak, ask my permission.

03:08.788 --> 03:12.315
- I was just saying how nice you seemed.
- You spoke again.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.460
I was paying you a compliment, buddy!

03:18.632 --> 03:23.763
I was saying you seemed to be a fair-minded
guy, not one of these psycho types.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.404
You spoke again!

03:28.174 --> 03:30.267
Come on. Back me up.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.741
Hang on. Wait. I get it. I'll shut up.

03:32.912 --> 03:35.073
I'll shut up. Now stop hitting me.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.079
That is definitely...

03:47.093 --> 03:51.393
- That is totally untrue, sir.
- Save it, Mr Ackerman.

03:51.564 --> 03:56.558
I thought long and hard about a suitable
punishment and I've come up with this.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.499
You and a team of your choice

03:58.672 --> 04:02.699
will play basketball against a team of guards
led by Mr Ackerman.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.344
God bless you, sir.

04:06.279 --> 04:11.876
Where you will be trounced and humiliated
in front of the entire inmate population.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.613
If we lose, Baxter and his cronies
will beat us to a pulp.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.983
You'd better win, then.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.981
Here, guys. Way to go!

04:43.149 --> 04:48.678
- You were supposed to be picking up Rice.
- I did. We're meeting for drinks on Thursday.

04:48.855 --> 04:54.657
- Not that kind of picking up, you ninny!
- We gotta stop arguing. We can't lose this.

04:54.828 --> 04:59.026
- It's all taken care of.
- As soon as the guards swig their juice.

04:59.199 --> 05:04.068
A skutter's got something out of the medi lab -
that stuff that helps impotent guys.

05:04.237 --> 05:09.504
- Boing, the virility enhancement drug?
- Yeah. We've Mickey Finned their drinks.

05:09.676 --> 05:15.239
Within seconds, you're harder than a quadratic
equation. It doesn't wear off for seven hours.

05:15.415 --> 05:20.318
Those guys are going to be like catapults!
That will seriously slow them down.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.820
Try moving fast with a fishing pole in your pants!

05:23.990 --> 05:28.017
Get out there and kill.
They're lambs to the slaughter.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.739
Seven hours.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.511
Do you know how long that is?

07:33.686 --> 07:37.952
I couldn't remove my shorts until after midnight.

07:38.958 --> 07:43.361
When I wanted a leak, I had to do
a handstand on the toilet seat.

07:44.297 --> 07:49.166
I stopped the lift doors from closing -
I wasn't even catching a lift.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.599
- Did it come from the medi lab?
- Yes.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.673
How? If it was one of those damn skutters,
I'll have it crushed.

07:56.643 --> 08:01.637
It was me, sir, when the doc's back was turned.
I went to the medi lab for a sick note,

08:01.848 --> 08:06.182
but the doc didn't accept it was possible
to have athlete's hand.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.919
First thing tomorrow,
you're on spud duty for two weeks.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.285

08:38.116 --> 08:41.416
- Yeah. God, this is hard!
- Are you doing a crossword?

08:41.587 --> 08:43.988
No, join the dots.

08:46.626 --> 08:47.888
- What number are you stuck on?
- 124.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.630
124...

08:51.798 --> 08:53.857
124...

08:54.033 --> 08:56.968
Have you tried 125?

08:57.136 --> 09:00.594
I know the number.
It's finding it that's the hard bit.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.003
I'm not some brain-dead simpleton.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.144
Ah, there it is.

09:07.146 --> 09:10.115
Look at that. It's a bucket and spade!

09:15.355 --> 09:17.186
It's clever that, isn't it?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.019
Ah, supper!

09:26.065 --> 09:28.727
Are we supposed to tip them? I'm never sure.

09:33.806 --> 09:38.106
I've seen things more appetising
on the floors of elephant houses.

09:38.277 --> 09:41.508
Only a total idiot would eat this.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.351
They call this meat?

09:49.522 --> 09:54.653
My grandmother's buttocks deep-fried
in old chip fat would taste better than this.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.159
We're on the punishment menu now.

09:57.330 --> 10:01.198
- No chips, no ice cream.
- Because we're on punishment detail?

10:01.367 --> 10:05.633
Yeah. Kill Crazy says this is
cloning experiments that have gone wrong

10:05.805 --> 10:08.273
with gravy slopped over to disguise it.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.207
You waited until I was swallowing
to say that, didn't you?

10:13.112 --> 10:16.104
He swears he got something
with two noses in it.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.183
He didn't. They can't do that. It's illegal.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.343
His starter sneezed.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.618
- Jimbo Steele was a witness.
- Kill Crazy's insane.

10:25.792 --> 10:31.662
He's got lots of strange ideas. He reckons
when they flush a loo on a plane, it drops out.

10:33.266 --> 10:37.703
That's why you can't go to the lav
when the plane's standing on the runway -

10:37.870 --> 10:39.861
for fear of skid starts.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.901
- He's probably right.
- Of course he isn't.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.877
- Why else won't they let you go?
- I don't know.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.915
Maybe they're helping you break up the journey.

10:52.085 --> 10:56.613
If you went first off, you'd have nothing to do
after you'd eaten your cheese.

10:56.789 --> 11:01.886
Kill Crazy's probably right. That's why
houses on the flight path are so cheap.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.997
- Because of all the flushing planes?
- Think about it.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.636
You can't sunbathe or have a barbecue,

11:11.804 --> 11:15.638
and you have to go out in a washable hat
and leg it to your car.

11:16.476 --> 11:20.640
It's the noise. Houses on the flight path
are cheap because of the noise.

11:20.813 --> 11:24.078
The noise? But they're half a mile up.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.708
You'd never hear people on the loo
from that distance.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.988
- Not unless they were like my Uncle Dan.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.844
Hang on. I'm onto something here.

13:02.014 --> 13:07.680
Forget the potato peelers. We want one of those
programmable viruses from the science block.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.822
Programmable what?

13:09.989 --> 13:13.982
They were on Z deck. I wonder
if the nanos have reconstructed them.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.994
You can programme them
to do anything you want. You name it.

13:18.164 --> 13:22.794
We could programme them to eat
the potato skins and leave the rest intact.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.460
We wouldn't have to lift a finger.

- It's working on this one.
- Yes!

19:58.530 --> 20:02.091
- And here's another. And another.
- Yes!

20:02.268 --> 20:04.828
And another! Fan-smegging-tastic.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.701
We're on our way. They'll do
the whole damn room in minutes.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.509
- What's happened to your sleeve, man?
- What?

20:12.678 --> 20:15.772
- Your sleeve.
- My God! They're eating my clothes.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.506
(LAUGHS)

20:56.088 --> 20:57.783
Well?

20:58.557 --> 21:01.321
It wasn't me, sir, it was him. He made me do it.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.961
You Judas! We'd agreed to refuse to talk.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.791
Let me blame you, then I'll refuse to talk.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.963
If I ever, ever see you in this office again,

21:11.136 --> 21:13.934
then you're in the hole. Is that what you want?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.098
- (BOTH) No, sir.
- Well, then. Get out.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.245
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

21:26.952 --> 21:30.752
You haven't been to the medi bay
to get this virus off, have you?

21:30.923 --> 21:34.757
- I probably shouldn't have shaken your hand.
- Big mistake.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.623
- We'll be going, sir.
- Right now.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.257
That's it!

21:41.834 --> 21:43.165
Two months

21:43.335 --> 21:44.927
in the hole!

21:45.104 --> 21:47.800
Sir, what about me athlete's hand?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.702
Now!

21:55.147 --> 21:58.605
(KRYTEN) We zap the ship
with a two-year download of time.

21:58.784 --> 22:02.345
The records will show
that we are free to be released.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.182
This machine's amazing!

22:04.356 --> 22:08.156
Can it do boob jobs, too?
I'm just thinking about the future.

22:09.595 --> 22:12.758
- You spilt my soup.
- Sorry, Baxter, non-bud.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.922
It was an accident.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.633
Hot Bovril.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.436
Agh!

22:35.354 --> 22:36.787
Grr!

22:39.024 --> 22:43.120
Look at him. The big lug.
I'd hate to clean the bath out after him.

22:43.295 --> 22:48.130
You'd need a sander to get rid of the tide mark
and a leaf vac to hoover the hair.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.529
Fix him. Fix him with the time wand.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.068
Watch this.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.441
(LAUGHS)

23:23.001 --> 23:26.437
- Hello!
- There's someone in here with us!

23:26.605 --> 23:29.096
Yeah, it's that bloke sitting next to you.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.370
- Who are you?
- They call me Birdman.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.103
Why's that?

23:35.280 --> 23:39.148
Because he really likes instant custard (!)
Why do you think?

23:40.152 --> 23:46.716
This is Pete. He's nine years old,
which in sparrow years is...

23:46.892 --> 23:49.383
...nine years old.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.722
So, that makes him...

23:52.831 --> 23:54.355
Nine?

23:54.533 --> 23:57.229
Nine! That's right. Met him before, have you?

23:58.504 --> 24:00.904
Two months of this! God!

24:01.073 --> 24:03.405
(DRILLING)

24:05.010 --> 24:06.307
What's this?

24:09.615 --> 24:13.244
(SQUEAKING "GREAT ESCAPE" THEME)

24:22.394 --> 24:26.558
(RIMMER) What happened?
(LISTER) They're all frozen on the spot.

24:28.066 --> 24:31.194
Yvonne McGruder did this
when I tried to kiss her.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.770
This'll drive them crazy!

24:48.153 --> 24:50.951
- (KRIS) Hey!
- Guys!

24:51.123 --> 24:54.320
- Buddies!
- This is Birdman.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.960
And this is Pete.

24:56.128 --> 25:00.360
We found this machine that can digitise time.
We can release jets of it.

25:00.532 --> 25:03.296
It can make our sentence pass in a nano second.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.402
Hats off, sirs.

25:07.773 --> 25:11.106
- There's something wrong with Pete.
- What?

25:11.276 --> 25:13.301
He's gone all stiff!

25:13.478 --> 25:16.538
He must have drunk the guards' half-time juice.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.876
Not that kind of stiff. He's dead.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.820
The excitement of being free has killed him!

25:22.988 --> 25:27.322
He really loved that bird.
It was the only thing that kept him going.

25:27.492 --> 25:33.192
I think the time wand could bring Pete back
to life - make him young and strong again.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.832
Watch.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.471
(ROAR)

25:49.648 --> 25:51.878
- Holy...
...smeg!

25:52.050 --> 25:56.077
(ROAR)

25:56.254 --> 25:59.417
Where the hell did Barney's ugly brother
come from?

26:00.525 --> 26:03.790
From Pete, sir. Birds are descended
from dinosaurs.

26:03.962 --> 26:07.728
I inadvertently reversed evolution
several million years.

26:12.771 --> 26:17.208
An old Cat saying has particular relevance here.
It goes like this -

26:17.376 --> 26:20.937
we are all gonna die!

26:21.113 --> 26:23.604
Pete? Is that you, Pete?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.713
Birdman!

26:31.089 --> 26:32.488
(SNEEZES)

26:34.926 --> 26:36.393
Gesundheit.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.027
You want some seed?

26:41.933 --> 26:44.629
That's a no, then, is it?

26:47.506 --> 26:48.905
What now, sir?

26:49.074 --> 26:51.736
Follow the Rimmer-shaped blur!

26:54.813 --> 26:58.146
(POUNDING FOOTSTEPS)

27:09.695 --> 27:13.426
<i>(SONG) It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

27:13.598 --> 27:16.692
<i>I'm all alone, more or less</i>

27:16.868 --> 27:19.996
<i>Let me fly far away from here</i>

27:20.172 --> 27:22.902

27:23.075 --> 27:26.841

27:27.012 --> 27:30.243

27:30.415 --> 27:33.384

27:33.552 --> 27:36.817
