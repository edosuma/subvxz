WEBVTT

00:04.389 --> 00:06.202
I spent 15 years in prison.

00:06.749 --> 00:08.069
Now I'm on the outside.

00:08.561 --> 00:11.186
Second chances are a beautiful thing.

00:14.031 --> 00:17.092
Excuse me. Where's
your line for business loans?

00:17.117 --> 00:19.277
- Right this way, sir.
- May I have some of this candy?

00:21.196 --> 00:22.366
Oh, oh!

00:30.180 --> 00:31.711
What kind of loan are you here for?

00:31.953 --> 00:33.276
I'm here for a food truck loan.

00:33.306 --> 00:34.836
Really? That's a coincidence.

00:34.876 --> 00:37.258
I'm here for a loan
for a food truck, too.

00:37.811 --> 00:38.976
Actually, it's my third.

00:39.326 --> 00:41.376
I specialize in molecular gastronomy.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.059
Right, right, right.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.684
- Do you know what that is?
- Some of it.

00:45.586 --> 00:48.797
It's the manipulation of chemical

00:48.822 --> 00:51.082
and physical interactions
with ingredients.

00:51.107 --> 00:53.878
This truck's gonna be
all ethnic street foods.

00:53.903 --> 00:56.394
Yeah, it's Oaxaca Wonders.

00:56.419 --> 01:00.636
So, this is Hispanic food
for people who hire Hispanics?

01:00.666 --> 01:02.254
Something like that, yeah.

01:04.004 --> 01:05.510
- Three trucks?
- Yeah.

01:05.536 --> 01:07.936
You must have f'd it up
the first two times, huh?

01:08.277 --> 01:09.730
Don't even worry about it, my dude.

01:09.755 --> 01:11.215
When I get my trucks up and running,

01:11.347 --> 01:13.277
I'ma show you how it's
supposed to be done.

01:13.317 --> 01:15.617
I got 25 years of selling experience.

01:15.647 --> 01:18.734
I keep a customer base satisfied,
you know what I mean?

01:18.759 --> 01:19.889
Mr. Cherry?

01:20.763 --> 01:21.988
That's me. Good luck.

01:23.357 --> 01:26.457
Damn. You getting a food
truck loan or a Ph.D.?

01:26.691 --> 01:29.214
First impressions and
presentation are everything.

01:44.961 --> 01:47.131
As chairman of the
restoration committee,

01:47.156 --> 01:52.326
I am thrilled to bring back
this cherished rink to Brooklyn.

01:52.351 --> 01:54.157
Come on, look alive, y'all.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.162
As a kid, On a Roll

01:56.187 --> 01:59.127
was one of my favorite places
to gather with my friends.

01:59.157 --> 02:00.957
Oh, you don't know how dope it is to see

02:00.997 --> 02:03.353
Shay up there doing her
Michelle Obama impression.

02:03.378 --> 02:05.048
It is inspiring.

02:05.073 --> 02:06.143
That's just Mom.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.512
No, no.

02:07.537 --> 02:09.507
That's only because
you know her like this.

02:09.537 --> 02:11.754
I remember when she was
so broke, in her crib,

02:11.779 --> 02:14.643
her TV had two channels... on and off.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.298
Yeah, slept in her car one time.

02:17.417 --> 02:21.387
Wow. If she could do it,
I know I could do it.

02:22.117 --> 02:24.523
- Whoo!
- Shay, Shay!

02:25.499 --> 02:27.922
- Come on. Your mom.
- And without further ado,

02:27.947 --> 02:32.422
I want to declare
On a Roll officially open!

02:35.412 --> 02:36.790
Let's go, Brooklyn!

02:40.407 --> 02:42.460
Thank you so much. We appreciate it.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.962
- Can we go now?
- Are you kidding?

02:44.987 --> 02:46.227
You guys didn't even skate yet.

02:46.537 --> 02:49.407
My feet are tired
just from walking here.

02:49.410 --> 02:51.994
Boy, are you serious?
We was only three blocks away.

02:52.377 --> 02:54.123
Can we hang out
at Starbucks until you're done?

02:54.147 --> 02:56.544
- Aw, hell, no! Have some respect.
- Oh, come on!

02:56.569 --> 02:59.333
Your mother's saving
a Brooklyn landmark here, okay?

02:59.357 --> 03:01.966
On a Roll is as Brooklyn
as Brooklyn can be.

03:01.991 --> 03:04.131
This rink is so important to us.

03:04.424 --> 03:06.997
It... it basically
raised half of Brooklyn.

03:07.022 --> 03:08.422
Did you know each other then?

03:08.447 --> 03:09.901
Aw, man, not yet.

03:09.926 --> 03:11.458
I would have pulled
her like a hamstring,

03:11.482 --> 03:13.173
but I didn't know her yet.
You know what I'm saying?

03:13.197 --> 03:14.991
Thank God because y'all would be 25

03:15.016 --> 03:17.086
instead of 15, ya know what I'm saying?

03:17.111 --> 03:18.341
Shay know what I'm saying?

03:21.262 --> 03:25.486
But this place right here
gave me my first taste

03:25.511 --> 03:27.477
of hard-working responsibility.

03:27.517 --> 03:29.687
I made head skate guard in no time.

03:29.717 --> 03:33.187
Now, I didn't work here,
but I put in work with my skate crew.

03:34.102 --> 03:36.562
We called ourselves the BK Shortyz.

03:37.427 --> 03:42.584
It was Ce-Ce, my bestie
Turtle, me and my girl, Regina.

03:45.197 --> 03:47.053
BK Shortyz in full effect!

03:47.078 --> 03:48.338
Let's get it!

03:48.363 --> 03:50.963
We would challenge
other teams to skate-offs.

03:50.988 --> 03:53.373
They were like dance
battles, but on skates.

03:54.507 --> 03:57.647
There was always some other
crew trying to take our crown.

03:58.617 --> 04:01.920
Now, let's see what
the honeys got to offer!

04:02.975 --> 04:05.514
They come out, doing
their little tricks and moves,

04:06.223 --> 04:08.193
but they didn't have nothing on us

04:08.218 --> 04:09.758
because at the end of the day,

04:09.783 --> 04:11.317
if we couldn't out-skate you...

04:11.786 --> 04:13.786
Let's get these bitches!

04:20.922 --> 04:22.052
Shay Boogie?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.280
Shay Boogie!

04:24.305 --> 04:26.127
Lisa "Turtle" Johnson!

04:27.752 --> 04:30.446
- Girl!
- What up, mama?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.471
Oh, I missed you so much.

04:32.496 --> 04:33.837
You look so good.

04:33.862 --> 04:35.791
Girl, you look so good.

04:36.144 --> 04:38.393
- These are my kids.
- Aww.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.041
Yeah, and you know Tray.

04:40.066 --> 04:41.226
Mm-hmm.

04:41.251 --> 04:43.711
Oh, God.

04:43.957 --> 04:46.836
I see you still rolling with
the Michelin Man in blackface.

04:46.861 --> 04:49.991
- Girl.
- I told you, I'm posted up.

04:50.016 --> 04:51.806
No, he's here for the kids.

04:51.831 --> 04:53.661
I'm in post position.

04:53.686 --> 04:55.600
But your ears must be burnin'

04:55.625 --> 04:59.368
because I was just telling
them about the BK Shortyz!

04:59.393 --> 05:00.470
Unh-unh.

05:01.447 --> 05:03.107
I wonder what the other girls are up to.

05:03.147 --> 05:04.632
I see them heifers all the time.

05:04.657 --> 05:07.063
We were just as Ce-Ce baby
christening last Sunday.

05:07.088 --> 05:08.212
Huh?

05:08.929 --> 05:10.616
Is that "FOMO" I'm reading

05:10.641 --> 05:13.357
on your perfectly beat
face, Miss America?

05:13.382 --> 05:15.035
'Cause you ain't missin' nothing.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.625
I seen your Facebook.

05:16.727 --> 05:20.874
I know you more Shay Bougie
and less Shay Boogie these days.

05:20.899 --> 05:24.842
Girl, please. I am
still the same ol' Shay Boogie.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.149
You want to exchange numbers?

05:26.174 --> 05:28.382
Why don't we just get all
the girls together tonight,

05:28.407 --> 05:31.406
and we party like it's 1999, damn it.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.901
Okay!

05:33.137 --> 05:35.947
I think there might be a little
Shay Boogie left up in there.

05:35.977 --> 05:38.349
It's 100% Shay Boogie up in here.

05:38.374 --> 05:39.774
Yo, Shannon!

05:40.347 --> 05:43.352
The kids said they want
some Nobu sushi for lunch.

05:43.883 --> 05:46.493
They said it's fancy and mad expensive.

05:46.787 --> 05:49.427
I assume you're gonna pay
for it because you know

05:49.457 --> 05:50.957
I ain't got that kind of dough.

05:54.711 --> 05:59.234
Bitch, then this dude took
a number two on the 2 train.

05:59.967 --> 06:02.067
We call that a double deuce.

06:02.107 --> 06:03.216
Stop!

06:03.741 --> 06:05.216
That happens all the time.

06:06.307 --> 06:09.347
Ooh, ooh, can you turn
that up? Turn that up!

06:09.377 --> 06:12.661
Y'all remember that
skate battle in 1996?

06:14.002 --> 06:16.169
5, 6, 7, 8.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.304
Ooh, ooh.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.980
His first night alone with the baby.

06:34.005 --> 06:35.744
Sir, can you turn that down?

06:35.769 --> 06:37.209
Hey, honey.

06:37.637 --> 06:41.052
No, you cannot kill the baby
by burping him too much.

06:41.450 --> 06:43.052
Okay, bye.

06:43.199 --> 06:46.069
I love that man to death,
but he is so damn dumb.

06:47.619 --> 06:49.549
That's too bad, Ce-Ce, because my boo,

06:49.574 --> 06:50.944
Greg, he smart as hell.

06:50.969 --> 06:52.769
- For real?
- He a sweetie, too.

06:52.794 --> 06:55.662
Ohh. That's sweet.

06:55.687 --> 06:58.854
Ooh, ooh, ooh. I got this.
No arguments at all.

06:58.879 --> 07:00.609
I'm taking care of this.

07:00.634 --> 07:01.764
Thank you, girl.

07:02.034 --> 07:03.566
Y'all, let me call my husband.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.160
He limited.

07:05.355 --> 07:06.636
Ooh, bathroom.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.007
Thanks again, girl, because
you know my money tight

07:10.037 --> 07:11.607
as one-day-old braids.

07:13.362 --> 07:15.222
I know you don't know
nothing about that.

07:15.247 --> 07:18.136
I do know about that...
the one-day-old braids.

07:18.824 --> 07:19.854
You know what?

07:20.185 --> 07:23.951
My job is hiring a temp,
so why don't you go ahead

07:23.976 --> 07:25.576
and e-mail me your résumé,

07:25.687 --> 07:27.287
and I'll put in a good word for you.

07:27.327 --> 07:28.823
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.393
Boogie, that would be so dope.

07:31.597 --> 07:33.927
Whoo! You the real MVP for real.

07:33.967 --> 07:36.287
Yes. Thank you.

07:37.186 --> 07:40.567
Okay, but don't actually
call any of those references.

07:40.607 --> 07:41.985
You'll just get my brother Dwain.

07:42.010 --> 07:43.305
He got a nice, white phone voice,

07:43.329 --> 07:44.757
and that nigga owe me a favor.

07:44.782 --> 07:46.172
Oh, okay.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.265
Looking good, kid.

07:53.076 --> 07:54.174
You think this suit says,

07:54.199 --> 07:55.974
"You should give me
a loan for a food truck?"

07:55.999 --> 07:57.528
- Yes.
- "'Cause I'm a responsible dude."

07:57.552 --> 07:58.553
Yes, cuzzo.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.202
You looking like a CEO,
you know what I'm saying?

08:00.226 --> 08:01.487
And I'm your assistant CEO.

08:01.517 --> 08:02.625
And I'ma tell you something.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.256
I'm with you through thick and thin.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.399
Oh, I gotta go, cuzzo. Oh, yeah.

08:08.424 --> 08:10.924
I got me a jump-off, and
she throwing up the bat-signal.

08:10.997 --> 08:13.173
- Look at that.
- Bobby, you can't leave me hanging, man.

08:13.197 --> 08:15.448
You my ride and my emotional support.

08:16.503 --> 08:17.503
Mm!

08:18.783 --> 08:22.393
I can't come because
I'm with my cousin today.

08:24.597 --> 08:26.367
You owe me this.

08:26.392 --> 08:29.160
Look at this. She got a friend.
Do you see that?

08:29.185 --> 08:30.815
- Ooh!
- She got a... yes.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.309
Man, I can get a loan
for a food truck later, man.

08:33.335 --> 08:34.895
That's what I'm talking about. Come on.

08:35.875 --> 08:37.135
Oh, shit!

08:37.967 --> 08:39.761
No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?

08:39.787 --> 08:40.827
I'm doing what's right.

08:40.857 --> 08:43.027
- You can't touch an OWL.
- What is an OWL?

08:43.057 --> 08:44.397
An Old White Lady.

08:44.427 --> 08:45.897
It's okay. I'm gonna help you, okay?

08:45.927 --> 08:46.966
You fell down.

08:46.991 --> 08:48.671
Where do you live?
I'm gonna take you home.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.571
I don't know.

08:51.135 --> 08:52.625
Just leave her where you found her.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.142
Like a half-eaten burrito?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.407
No. Bobby, get the car.

08:55.437 --> 08:56.537
What are you talking about?

08:57.129 --> 08:58.854
- Bobby, get the car!
- Okay.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.391
Here's our new spring
collection which I like

09:01.416 --> 09:03.422
because it's very flowy and...

09:03.447 --> 09:04.917
Here, girl, your veggie burger.

09:04.947 --> 09:06.205
Thank you, Lisa.

09:06.230 --> 09:08.205
Amy, you had the masala bowl,

09:08.230 --> 09:10.160
and you had the supergreens salad.

09:10.617 --> 09:11.687
Okay.

09:12.127 --> 09:13.727
Did you get something for yourself?

09:13.757 --> 09:17.397
Oh, I kind of didn't know
lunch was covered,

09:17.427 --> 09:19.222
so I just brought something in.

09:19.655 --> 09:21.025
Just leftovers.

09:22.372 --> 09:23.772
Catfish and corn bread.

09:29.451 --> 09:31.926
You know what?
Do you got enough to split?

09:32.565 --> 09:34.106
You know I got you, girl.

09:35.147 --> 09:36.177
Good.

09:37.976 --> 09:40.806
- It's good, right?
- Yes, girl. Mm.

09:40.932 --> 09:43.832
Boogie, I hope I didn't
embarrass you back there.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.607
Turtle, do you know how relieved I am

09:46.632 --> 09:49.627
to finally have someone I could
relate to on the same level?

09:49.657 --> 09:51.597
It's not a lot of us up in here.

09:51.622 --> 09:53.522
I don't even know why I do this job.

09:53.547 --> 09:57.577
I should be designing
fashion shows on major runways

09:57.602 --> 10:00.302
in Milan doing me, living my best life.

10:00.327 --> 10:01.930
I feel you, girl.

10:03.877 --> 10:06.272
Lisa. You all right?

10:07.542 --> 10:08.671
What's going on?

10:10.850 --> 10:12.749
Greg broke up with me.

10:13.453 --> 10:15.884
I don't understand what happened.

10:15.909 --> 10:17.673
He just flipped.

10:18.087 --> 10:22.372
And he's already posting pics
with him and his side chick.

10:23.797 --> 10:28.593
And it's already got 173 likes.

10:28.618 --> 10:29.976
Fuck her.

10:30.257 --> 10:33.087
And you know what really
pisses me off, Boogie?

10:33.237 --> 10:39.977
He said that he's keeping
the couch that we bought together.

10:41.647 --> 10:44.879
Go ahead and let it out.
Come on, let it out, boo-boo.

10:44.904 --> 10:46.704
Let it out.

10:49.217 --> 10:50.593
- Why?
- Yeah, maybe a little bit softer.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.701
Let it out a little bit softer.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.014
Whoo.

10:56.962 --> 10:57.962
I think that's it.

10:58.569 --> 10:59.571
No worries.

11:00.079 --> 11:01.573
That's why I'm happy
we're here together.

11:01.597 --> 11:03.327
We can look out for each other again

11:03.352 --> 11:05.493
like we used to, all right?

11:07.158 --> 11:08.288
You know what?

11:09.777 --> 11:11.290
You up to doing my schedule for me?

11:11.859 --> 11:14.589
Oh. Um, yeah.

11:14.817 --> 11:18.525
Okay, so in-house meeting at 3:00,
model fitting at 4:00.

11:18.917 --> 11:21.359
Oh, and erase everything else
from my schedule after that

11:21.384 --> 11:24.840
because tonight, we gonna
go get your couch back, girl.

11:24.865 --> 11:26.307
Oh, hell, yeah.

11:26.332 --> 11:27.902
Mm-hmm.

11:28.227 --> 11:29.943
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of you.

11:29.967 --> 11:31.555
We good, we good, we good.

11:32.419 --> 11:34.502
Yo! Open up!

11:34.527 --> 11:35.913
Me and Bobby got this
old white woman with us.

11:35.937 --> 11:37.356
- Man, we need your help.
- Nope.

11:37.381 --> 11:39.165
- What are you doing to me?
- No, don't leave!

11:39.189 --> 11:40.776
Come on, son!

11:40.801 --> 11:41.808
Ohh!

11:42.837 --> 11:45.007
Just be cool, okay, all right.

11:45.047 --> 11:47.183
Just look at the pretty
pictures, all right?

11:47.208 --> 11:49.231
I'll be right back, okay.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.197
Tray! I don't know about this.

11:52.222 --> 11:53.722
Everybody, be cool!

11:53.947 --> 11:56.638
Okay, thank God I watched
10,000 hours of "Law & Order,"

11:56.663 --> 11:57.957
so I basically grew up

11:57.987 --> 12:00.974
in a district attorney's office,
okay? I'm a pro.

12:00.999 --> 12:04.002
The first thing we need
to do is go in her purse

12:04.027 --> 12:06.097
and find out who this old white lady is.

12:06.127 --> 12:08.997
And here is the contents
of said old white lady's purse.

12:10.465 --> 12:12.395
No wallet, no ID. Damn!

12:12.420 --> 12:14.050
Look, somebody already robbed her.

12:14.207 --> 12:15.937
That mean they gonna
really put this on us.

12:15.977 --> 12:17.803
They ain't putting nothing no nobody

12:17.828 --> 12:19.102
because look what's right here.

12:19.368 --> 12:22.298
A Golden Crust packet. You understand?

12:22.447 --> 12:25.477
That's a Jamaican joint,
so the old white lady loves beef patties.

12:25.502 --> 12:26.833
Interesting.

12:26.858 --> 12:28.398
So what else we got?

12:28.729 --> 12:30.963
Seems like the old white
lady's near some kind of a park.

12:30.987 --> 12:32.522
- Check that out, Tray.
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.547 --> 12:33.757
That's Prospect Park.

12:34.548 --> 12:35.948
How do you know for sure, though?

12:35.973 --> 12:37.303
The elm trees.

12:37.328 --> 12:39.003
Prospect Park is
the only place in the city

12:39.027 --> 12:41.884
- with elm trees and wildflower garlic.
- Wildflower garlic.

12:41.909 --> 12:43.469
Interesting.

12:43.494 --> 12:45.743
I seen them cups somewhere.
That's in the prison psych ward,

12:45.767 --> 12:47.158
but what's all that powder stuff on it?

12:47.182 --> 12:48.259
That's pill residue.

12:48.937 --> 12:51.310
Oh, so Mrs. Owl is a pill popper.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.529
Okay, you know what?

12:53.128 --> 12:54.224
I got it.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.170
Mrs. Owl is an ex-con

12:57.461 --> 12:59.631
who sells opioids at a local park

12:59.747 --> 13:02.887
and kills Jamaicans who
step in her territory.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.657
Boom, bip, that's the theory to beat.

13:04.687 --> 13:06.133
That's the theory to beat right there.

13:06.157 --> 13:09.202
Gentlemen, I recognize
this at the nursing home

13:09.227 --> 13:10.427
that my grandmother's in.

13:10.452 --> 13:12.317
Lydia, because she got hairy legs,

13:12.342 --> 13:14.927
so she bring me down
there to lotion her legs up

13:14.967 --> 13:18.108
so the hair lay down flat
on her knee caps and thighs.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.540
Mm, she sound sexy as hell.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.883
Hey, back off, kid!

13:20.908 --> 13:23.178
So, so, so how do we
find this nursing home?

13:23.686 --> 13:24.846
Easy!

13:25.198 --> 13:27.798
We just triangulate
the locations we have here.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.193
We are looking for a nursing home

13:29.217 --> 13:31.102
near Golden Crust near Prospect Park.

13:31.509 --> 13:33.218
- Case closed, cuzzo.
- Science!

13:33.243 --> 13:35.536
- Bravo! Science!
- Science, yeah.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.694
Nigga, science? You just wrote
"interesting" over and over again.

13:37.718 --> 13:39.157
It was interesting to me.

13:39.182 --> 13:41.882
No, no, no, no, no! No!

13:41.907 --> 13:43.109
Mrs. Owl!

13:45.097 --> 13:46.764
All right, we get
Lisa's couch, and we out.

13:46.788 --> 13:47.835
- Copy.
- Copy.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.495
- Lisa, you got the key?
- I know where he keep it at.

13:49.519 --> 13:51.089
Okay, Ce-Ce, you keep lookout.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.117
Regina, me and you, we gonna
carry the couch to your car.

13:53.141 --> 13:54.211
- Bet.
- All right.

13:56.092 --> 13:57.864
Lisa! You all right?

13:58.283 --> 13:59.873
Hey!

14:00.077 --> 14:02.547
Come on, BK Shortyz, let's do this!

14:04.617 --> 14:05.947
What happened to the key?

14:05.972 --> 14:08.492
Girl, key is to brick
as brick is to key.

14:08.517 --> 14:10.727
- Is that a riddle?
- What's up?

14:11.324 --> 14:12.684
What, you scared?

14:12.716 --> 14:14.316
Hell, naw.

14:15.597 --> 14:18.797
Shay Boogie is in full effect, baby.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.426
Come on, come on. Let's hurry.

14:22.971 --> 14:24.677
- Right here, right here.
- We gonna get this sucker.

14:24.701 --> 14:27.507
Oh, yeah, we gonna rob
this... wait a minute.

14:27.532 --> 14:30.350
- One, two... okay.
- This is so nice.

14:31.253 --> 14:33.156
Who is his interior decorator?

14:33.181 --> 14:35.179
- Is that a Mika Marchay?
- Okay!

14:35.204 --> 14:36.649
I bid on this!

14:36.674 --> 14:38.344
Hey, Boogie, focus.

14:38.369 --> 14:39.735
Okay, all right, all right.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.617
But hey, I thought you
said this was a couch.

14:43.658 --> 14:44.750
It is a couch.

14:44.775 --> 14:46.605
But it looks like a sofa to me.

14:46.861 --> 14:49.191
It's a couch, whatever.
Come on, just lift it.

14:49.231 --> 14:52.083
- If you say so.
- Okay, one, two, three.

14:52.803 --> 14:54.433
Ooh, shit.

14:54.691 --> 14:56.561
Okay, all right, all right.

14:56.586 --> 14:57.746
That way, that way. That way.

14:57.871 --> 14:59.047
- Go, go, go.
- Watch the table.

14:59.071 --> 15:00.601
Watch the table, watch the table.

15:00.641 --> 15:01.971
- Ahh!
- Oh, shit!

15:02.011 --> 15:03.243
Ow! Ow!

15:04.841 --> 15:07.079
Turtle! Is this guy married?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.937
I told you he was messing
with some other chick.

15:10.248 --> 15:12.796
- Are you serious?
- What?

15:12.821 --> 15:15.121
Turtle, if he's married,
you're the other chick.

15:15.151 --> 15:17.521
I been with him just
as long as she has, okay?

15:17.561 --> 15:19.661
#ltsComplicated.

15:19.691 --> 15:21.261
Oh, my God.

15:21.291 --> 15:23.791
Shit. Who is this?

15:25.698 --> 15:28.568
Does Greg have a son
that's in a wheelchair?

15:28.593 --> 15:31.193
That motherfucker scored 18 points a game.

15:31.218 --> 15:32.718
He lead a full life.

15:32.743 --> 15:34.273
Lisa, you ain't shit.

15:34.298 --> 15:35.898
Can you get back on your post?

15:35.923 --> 15:37.553
Just tell me the truth, Turtle.

15:37.578 --> 15:39.408
Did you even buy this couch?

15:39.651 --> 15:42.311
I was with him when he bought it.
It's the same thing.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.665
You mean when he bought it
for his wife and his child

15:44.690 --> 15:45.860
that's in a wheelchair?

15:45.885 --> 15:47.455
Lisa, you ain't shit.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.366
He hurt me, okay?

15:49.391 --> 15:52.230
Now, can we please move
this motherfucking couch?

15:52.663 --> 15:53.663
Ooh!

15:54.521 --> 15:55.821
What the hell is going on?

15:55.846 --> 15:57.390
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.475
Lisa, you crazy bitch.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.672
I told you I was making
things work with my family.

16:02.184 --> 16:04.086
Wait, wait, this is her?

16:05.171 --> 16:06.971
Greg, you have got to be kidding me.

16:06.996 --> 16:09.445
It's not enough that you've been
sleeping with this ratchet girl,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.216
now you brought her sad, dingy,

16:11.241 --> 16:12.886
ratchet-ass friends up in my house?

16:12.911 --> 16:14.511
Uhh, you got a right to be pissed,

16:14.551 --> 16:17.151
but there ain't no need
of you calling us out our names.

16:17.181 --> 16:20.725
Oh, no, no, no. I don't need
an etiquette lesson from a damn burglar.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.090
- Get outta my house!
- Okay!

16:22.115 --> 16:24.296
Damn it, Lisa, bringing all this drama.

16:24.321 --> 16:26.400
What? Your wife the one turning up.

16:26.425 --> 16:27.425
Oh, I'm turning up?

16:27.450 --> 16:28.710
You broke into my house,

16:28.735 --> 16:30.954
tried to steal my sofa and my husband.

16:30.979 --> 16:32.517
See, I told you it was a sofa.

16:32.542 --> 16:34.237
- I knew it was a sofa.
- You know what...

16:34.262 --> 16:35.268
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

16:35.293 --> 16:37.006
Are you kidding me? All up in my house?

16:37.031 --> 16:38.876
- Ow!
- You rude!

16:38.901 --> 16:40.641
Are you kidding me?

16:40.671 --> 16:41.941
Don't be handing me shit!

16:41.971 --> 16:43.453
Come on! How about this?

16:46.392 --> 16:48.292
Oops, I just broke your dinosaur tooth.

16:49.262 --> 16:50.580
This is bananas.

16:50.605 --> 16:52.896
I'm calling the police.
I'm calling the police.

16:52.921 --> 16:54.455
We ain't scared of no police.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.450
I'm a little scared of the police.

16:56.475 --> 16:59.606
Greg, I'm better than this. I'm done.

16:59.631 --> 17:01.761
You know, you can just
sleep with this raggedy bitch

17:01.791 --> 17:03.131
for all I care. I don't care.

17:03.161 --> 17:05.208
I'm done. I'm done.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.933
Baby, please.

17:08.113 --> 17:09.231
Damn.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.282
I love you, Greg.

17:12.707 --> 17:14.010
Lisa, you ain't shit.

17:20.198 --> 17:21.867
That's for the window.

17:24.617 --> 17:26.417
Orderly with a wheelchair...

17:26.651 --> 17:27.951
Would you just be cool?

17:27.976 --> 17:29.453
The dude said he was gonna come back.

17:29.477 --> 17:31.337
Yeah, he gonna be right
back with the cops.

17:31.362 --> 17:33.832
Will you just take a breath and relax?

17:33.857 --> 17:35.007
- You're making me nervous.
- All right.

17:35.031 --> 17:36.469
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:36.494 --> 17:37.634
I'm sorry.

17:38.883 --> 17:39.928
Wow.

17:41.431 --> 17:43.737
I can't believe people just
throw people away like that.

17:45.941 --> 17:46.987
You know something?

17:48.008 --> 17:49.728
I would never let that
happen to you, Bobby.

17:50.608 --> 17:51.623
Never.

17:52.934 --> 17:54.108
Thank you, cuzzo.

17:57.251 --> 17:58.604
This the time when
you're supposed to make

17:58.628 --> 18:00.173
the same promise to me, Bobby.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.274
Oh, I can't do that.

18:02.299 --> 18:04.196
You... you don't take
care of yourself, Traybags.

18:04.220 --> 18:05.461
- What?
- You don't. You don't.

18:05.491 --> 18:08.361
You... you probably be
on dialysis or some shit,

18:08.391 --> 18:10.585
and I'm not changing
no grown man's diaper.

18:11.231 --> 18:12.601
- That's cold-blooded.
- You're...

18:12.626 --> 18:15.966
- Yeah.
- Are you the guys here about Mrs. St. John?

18:15.991 --> 18:17.835
Oh, yeah. Yes.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.560
Good news. She does live here.

18:19.671 --> 18:21.911
- I told you, "Law & Order" kid.
- All right, all right.

18:21.941 --> 18:23.557
You did, you did, you did.
All right, well, look.

18:23.581 --> 18:26.381
We got her purse, so you might
want to look for her nearby.

18:26.686 --> 18:27.873
Look for her? She's here.

18:28.651 --> 18:30.251
Rolled in about an hour ago.

18:30.281 --> 18:32.814
She's a wanderer, but she always
comes back when she's hungry.

18:32.839 --> 18:34.557
You know, I'm really sorry about this.

18:35.351 --> 18:36.894
I hope we don't have to call the police.

18:36.918 --> 18:38.796
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no. Totally unnecessary.

18:38.821 --> 18:40.261
Absolutely not.

18:40.791 --> 18:41.961
Awesome.

18:41.991 --> 18:43.621
Mrs. St. John is a bit of a klepto.

18:44.012 --> 18:45.042
What?

18:45.067 --> 18:48.246
You guys wouldn't happen
to know a Jayson Watkins?

18:48.271 --> 18:49.652
That's Jaybird. I'll take that.

18:50.192 --> 18:52.871
Oh, get your hands off me,
you black bastard!

18:52.896 --> 18:54.666
Ohh.

18:55.171 --> 18:56.879
That old white lady got issues.

18:57.777 --> 18:58.883
Did she touch you, too?

18:59.532 --> 19:00.792
What?!

19:09.721 --> 19:11.321
Oh, wow. You got some nerve.

19:11.361 --> 19:12.997
Before you say anything
or call the police,

19:13.021 --> 19:15.402
I know I look like a crazy
person coming back here,

19:15.427 --> 19:18.961
but I feel really terrible about
what we did the other night.

19:18.986 --> 19:21.716
And I just couldn't help but to notice

19:21.741 --> 19:25.611
how beautiful your sofa was
as I was trying to steal it.

19:25.671 --> 19:27.771
And then... and then
as I was thinking about that,

19:27.796 --> 19:29.926
I was, like, "Shannon, you know what?

19:29.951 --> 19:31.981
You need to apologize for that."

19:32.006 --> 19:34.806
I just... I just
wanted to say I'm sorry,

19:34.831 --> 19:37.170
and so I got you this beautiful

19:37.195 --> 19:39.881
matching throw pillow
to go with your sofa.

19:39.906 --> 19:41.421
I thought it'd be a nice accent.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.221
Just leave it there.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.361
I know I was wrong
for being up in your house,

19:50.401 --> 19:52.531
but I just ran into
one of my old homegirls,

19:52.561 --> 19:54.501
and I kind of got
caught up in pretending

19:54.531 --> 19:56.446
to be somebody that I'm not anymore.

19:56.471 --> 19:58.471
And... and you know, I just used to be

19:58.501 --> 20:00.271
so much fun, and I used to turn up.

20:00.311 --> 20:02.471
You remember being, like, wild and crazy

20:02.511 --> 20:05.281
before you had kids and before
you get married and all that?

20:05.311 --> 20:09.181
So, I should have just stopped
at the "I'm sorry." I'm sorry.

20:09.211 --> 20:11.072
I should have never been
in your home like that,

20:11.096 --> 20:15.493
and I totally understand if you
don't ever want to talk to me,

20:15.518 --> 20:18.411
but girl, your taste is good.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.434
You got really good taste, but I'm...

20:22.191 --> 20:23.531
Can you get off my property?

20:24.261 --> 20:25.607
I'm s... I'm really sorry. I apologize.

20:25.631 --> 20:26.874
Okay, thank you.

20:38.084 --> 20:39.741
What the hell was I thinking?

20:40.305 --> 20:46.301
