-We saw his men on the boat.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.100
They covered the police sign to disguise it.

02:59.110 --> 03:01.010
I mean, they're proper pirates.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.020
Okay, he's a crook,

03:04.030 --> 03:06.060

we can't just go after his money without expecting repercussions.

-Yeah, well, I want to know exactly why he thinks a bit of fresh air

04:09.140 --> 04:13.070
is gonna change the fact that I put man in a coma last night.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.210
-It could use a few more plants just to brighten it up a bit.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.050
-I don't need plants.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.090
I need peace,

16:38.100 --> 16:39.100
and quiet.

16:39.110 --> 16:41.030
I have so much work to do.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.230
I cannot help you.

16:43.100 --> 16:48.000
-Oh, Ramiro. Can't we just drop in to see an old friend? We missed you.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.040
-Please.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.030
I'm so...

16:50.150 --> 16:51.220
very, very busy.

16:52.060 --> 16:53.100
-Yeah, busy,

16:53.210 --> 16:56.060
in your new position as supervisor.

16:57.210 --> 16:59.060
-Yes, exactly.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.040
In my new position

17:01.160 --> 17:02.200
as a supervisor.

17:02.210 --> 17:03.200
-So...

17:03.210 --> 17:07.000
not a bad gig for a young man your age, is it now, Ramiro?

17:08.050 --> 17:09.010
-Lotti: You know what I think?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.100
-I'm not sure I want to know what you think, Lotti.

17:13.110 --> 17:14.200
Well, I think

17:15.160 --> 17:18.160
that behind those reading glasses...

17:19.010 --> 17:21.000
and starched collars...

17:21.090 --> 17:25.180
is an adventurous young man who just needs a bit of jeopardy in his life

17:26.050 --> 17:27.160
to keep things interesting.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.190
-Ramiro: Hmm.

17:30.010 --> 17:31.140
-Charlie: Let us help you...

17:31.150 --> 17:32.200
express yourself.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.060
-Okay.

17:42.070 --> 17:45.190
Ramiro Ramirez... at your service.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.210
(exhales)

17:47.220 --> 17:49.130
-(indistinct Spanish chatter)

17:57.140 --> 17:58.120
-(car engine revs)

17:59.180 --> 18:00.150
-Ines: Let's go.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.030
-I'm driving.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.060
-That's not how this works.

18:13.210 --> 18:17.100
-Yeah, well, I'm done being a passenger, so either I drive or you go alone.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.020
-Then drive.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.060
-(car tires squeal)

18:37.130 --> 18:39.130
-Hate 'Em: Easy, Fanta, easy, easy, son.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.130
-Now, lemon.

18:40.140 --> 18:42.020
-Lemon. That much, yeah?

18:42.030 --> 18:45.000
Put some lemon. Now, you slow down with the lemon.

18:45.010 --> 18:46.080
-Vic: Fanta, give us a minute alone.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.180
-Um,  sí, señor.

18:51.010 --> 18:51.230
-What are you cooking?

18:52.000 --> 18:52.210
-And where have you been?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.230
Lily's been blowing up my phone.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.090
-Is my wife in residence?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.200
-She was, and she left.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.090
Look...

19:01.210 --> 19:04.230
you gotta stop putting me in these positions. She thinks I'm covering for you.

19:12.230 --> 19:13.200
-Hide this.

19:13.210 --> 19:15.040
I can't keep it at home.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.020
-Vic, what's going on?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.160
Is there anything I should be worried about?

19:21.100 --> 19:25.150
-Worry is a misuse of the imagination, Hate 'Em.

19:26.140 --> 19:29.020
-So you're just carrying this around for a bit of fun now, are ya?

19:29.030 --> 19:31.170
-All kinds of fun in the sun, mate.

19:32.140 --> 19:33.100
-Well...

19:34.120 --> 19:37.230
this has been a really rich and rewarding conversation, hasn't it, Vic?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.000
-Just rest assured...

19:43.150 --> 19:45.170
I will not let sleeping dogs lie.

19:45.180 --> 19:49.090
-No, that doesn't sound reassuring, Vic, does it?

19:55.120 --> 19:56.160
Needs salt.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.220
-Fanta!

20:07.150 --> 20:08.130
-Fanta:  Que?

20:12.020 --> 20:13.140
-Charlie: What have you got for us, Ramiro?

20:16.160 --> 20:19.090
-A complete file on the address requested,

20:19.100 --> 20:22.220
not, I should say, without some great personal risk.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.150
-Thank you. You're very brave.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.090
-Yes, I am.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.130
-You, uh, you make any sense of this?

20:31.160 --> 20:32.130
-I think...

20:33.050 --> 20:35.230
Mayor Ortega has something to hide.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.060
-Go on...

20:39.070 --> 20:42.150
The Cisneros Fish Market has been closed for years,

20:42.160 --> 20:46.130
its title held by the city until Mayor Ortega bought it

20:46.140 --> 20:48.050
just after his election.

20:49.170 --> 20:53.070
Oddly, Ortega never began

20:53.080 --> 20:58.070
any of the repairs that would really be necessary to reopen the market.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.220
But there was some new construction, though I can't make much sense of the work.

21:02.230 --> 21:04.020
-So, you've seen it?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.180
-The blueprints.

21:05.190 --> 21:09.010
-And-- and-- and you didn't happen to bring a copy of those, did you?

21:09.020 --> 21:10.130
-Yeah...

21:10.140 --> 21:13.000
of course you did!

21:15.150 --> 21:18.000
-I never was here, okay?

Now she's just a novice, but I told her

24:02.120 --> 24:03.160

24:05.220 --> 24:06.210
-You from San Toledo?

24:07.090 --> 24:08.200

-That's a bit vague.

24:11.170 --> 24:13.000
-That's all you're going to get.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.090
We are here.

24:45.220 --> 24:48.160
Stay out of my way once we are in there, okay?

24:49.050 --> 24:50.130
I'm not a babysitter.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.090
-Really?

24:53.040 --> 24:55.040
You've got such a warm disposition.

25:07.210 --> 25:09.120
-We have to count the load.

25:11.090 --> 25:12.190
-Look, we didn't stop, right?

25:12.200 --> 25:16.010
Every crate picked up at the airport is here. It's all accounted for.

25:16.020 --> 25:18.170
-I said we count the load.

25:20.060 --> 25:25.210
(speaking Spanish)

25:26.190 --> 25:27.220

25:37.210 --> 25:39.220

25:40.210 --> 25:41.180
-And you?

25:42.100 --> 25:43.110
-I don't watch TV.

25:44.140 --> 25:45.210
-Right.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.230
Eh, me either.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.060
-Maybe Albert'll know.

26:05.070 --> 26:07.050
He is the son of a bank robber, after all.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.040
-Albert's got his hands full.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.060
-Vic: Speak of a bank robber, and he shall appear.

26:13.140 --> 26:16.180
Albert has got his hands full with what, exactly?

26:16.190 --> 26:19.230
-Aah, you know,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.030
just the usual kind of... Albert stuff.

26:24.040 --> 26:29.180
-Hm. And what, pray tell, do we have here?

26:31.170 --> 26:32.210
-It's a blueprint.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.080
-Well, I can see that, Lotti,

26:34.090 --> 26:36.050
the relevant information being

26:36.060 --> 26:38.190
a blueprint of what, exactly?

26:39.100 --> 26:41.180
-Well, it's the Cisneros Fish Market.

26:41.190 --> 26:46.060
-Hm. Albert looking to expand our holdings here in San Toledo, is he?

26:48.130 --> 26:49.160
-Actually...

26:50.140 --> 26:52.050
it belongs to the mayor.

26:52.070 --> 26:55.070
That place is a wreck. Ortega never did it up.

26:55.180 --> 26:59.190
We've seen Ortega's men come and go from here.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.160
We think he's using it as a stash house.

27:03.020 --> 27:07.050
-Charlie wants to tell me all this, Lotti, because he needs my help with something.

27:08.090 --> 27:09.080
Carry on.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.230
-We-- (sighs)

27:12.000 --> 27:14.080
we have good reason to believe

27:14.090 --> 27:17.060
that our money is somewhere stashed in that fish market.

27:18.060 --> 27:19.210
-Our money?

27:19.220 --> 27:21.160
-Yep, the 10 million euros.

27:22.020 --> 27:22.230
-Hm...

27:23.140 --> 27:26.020
right under our fucking noses.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.160
-You wanna help us get it back, Vic?

27:30.040 --> 27:32.120
-I wouldn't have it any other way, Charlie boy.

Where are you going?

32:19.150 --> 32:21.050
-To have a quiet drink to think things through.

32:21.060 --> 32:23.200
I've got a safe to blow, son. (laughing)

32:28.210 --> 32:31.060
-You think that was a smart idea telling Vic?

32:31.160 --> 32:32.160
-Well...

32:32.170 --> 32:35.200
I guess if you're gonna blow a safe, you need a bank robber, right?

32:37.030 --> 32:37.230
-Yeah?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.210
-Good money for good work. -(Lily and Clarence chuckle)

32:50.100 --> 32:51.090
-Thank you.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.100
-Not at all. You earned every penny.

32:54.110 --> 32:55.230
It was beautiful to watch.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.220
You worked them like a pro.

32:57.230 --> 33:01.190
-No, I mean, thank you for this, for today. I haven't had this much fun in a long while.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.120
-It's good to have fun, to love your life and...

33:05.060 --> 33:06.120
the people in it.

33:06.130 --> 33:07.100
-Hm.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.160
And you, Clarence?

33:11.060 --> 33:14.020
What about the people in your life? I've never seen you with anybody here.

33:14.030 --> 33:15.000
-Huh.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.120
Guess I must like my own company.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.110
-Hm.

33:20.040 --> 33:24.010
-Come on. Let's get you back. Wouldn't want your family getting worried about you.

33:24.020 --> 33:26.140
-Oh, I'm not sure they'd even notice I was gone, Clarence.

33:26.150 --> 33:28.110
-Come on, I'm sure that's not the case.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.040
-(Lily and Clarence chuckle)

33:36.080 --> 33:37.160
-(sighs)

33:42.230 --> 33:44.020
Yeah, we should be going.

33:44.110 --> 33:46.000
-Mm-hmm.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.190
-Look, I don't know what you think you saw back there--

34:09.200 --> 34:12.090
-Listen, I'm not in the mood for any more bullshit about what you are,

34:12.100 --> 34:14.040
or you aren't, doing for Ortega, okay?

34:14.050 --> 34:17.020
I know why I work for him, and I'm good with my reasons. Are you good with yours?

34:24.170 --> 34:25.140
-(lighter flicks)

34:30.050 --> 34:32.080
-When I was a girl, my dad was all I had.

34:35.090 --> 34:37.050
My mother left when I was a baby, so...

34:38.030 --> 34:39.070
it was just me and him.

34:40.070 --> 34:41.090
He was my hero.

34:42.110 --> 34:43.080
And then...

34:44.170 --> 34:46.050
when I was a teenager,

34:47.180 --> 34:49.060
he died, suddenly.

34:54.130 --> 34:55.100
-What happened?

34:58.010 --> 34:59.030
-He was set up and killed

34:59.200 --> 35:02.170
by a policeman over a deal he had nothing to do with.

35:05.050 --> 35:06.190
The last time I saw my father,

35:08.010 --> 35:09.040
he was lying...

35:10.060 --> 35:12.010
face down on the pavement...

35:14.070 --> 35:15.190
with the back of his head blown out.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.090
-Shit.

35:22.230 --> 35:23.190
I'm sorry.

35:27.130 --> 35:28.100
Really.

35:31.010 --> 35:33.070
-I've been looking for the man who framed him ever since.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.140
Working for Ortega gives me access.

35:42.110 --> 35:43.080
-Are you close?

35:45.000 --> 35:45.200
-Yes.

35:49.170 --> 35:50.140
I'm close.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.000
-(door chimes ring)

36:12.160 --> 36:13.160
-Irnos.

36:20.110 --> 36:21.150
Llamo la policia.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.200
Lo tienes que pagar.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.030
-No vamos a pagar una mierda.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.170
-Billy: The  señora  told you to pay for that.

36:40.180 --> 36:42.110
-What's it got to do with you?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.170
-Listen,

36:45.140 --> 36:46.180
put it all back,

36:46.190 --> 36:48.110
and nobody has to get slapped.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.180
(sniffs)

37:03.030 --> 37:04.040
It's your last chance.

37:08.170 --> 37:09.200
-(can drops)

37:26.000 --> 37:27.090
-Señor, muchas gracias

37:28.050 --> 37:29.150
Thank you very much.

37:30.230 --> 37:33.190
These kids are taking advantage of us.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.040
There is nothing I can do.

37:36.140 --> 37:37.150
-I can help ya.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.230
Stay around here for a bit, make sure nobody takes anything.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.130
I mean, I could pack shelves, help keep the place clean.

37:46.070 --> 37:49.080
-I cannot afford to take on an employee at the moment.

37:49.190 --> 37:52.080
-Listen, you can just pay me in beer and food.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.110
All right?

37:58.050 --> 37:59.100
-You're not from here.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.080
Do you live in San Toledo or just visiting?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.130
-I guess I live here now.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.040
-(Ortega sighs)

38:53.210 --> 38:55.160
-(crickets chirping)

39:04.000 --> 39:05.070
-Mr. Hill.

39:07.050 --> 39:09.100
I had a feeling that you've been looking for me,

39:10.130 --> 39:12.140
so I thought I'd come to you instead.

39:13.170 --> 39:18.080
-You're mistaken. I've got no interest in you whatsoever.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.000
-Please sit down.

39:24.230 --> 39:27.180
You and I are not so different.

39:28.190 --> 39:30.210
We both take what we want.

39:30.220 --> 39:33.140
We just have a different way of doing business.

39:33.150 --> 39:39.000
-(scoffs) From where I'm standing, we're cut from a very different cloth.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.130
-Your son seems to have a different perspective.

39:44.210 --> 39:48.020
He's a young man, making his own way in the world.

39:48.030 --> 39:51.140
He is smart enough to recognize the order of things,

39:52.160 --> 39:54.030
and he acts accordingly.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.200
But it appears...

40:00.210 --> 40:05.040
some others may require a somewhat harsher demonstration.

40:23.000 --> 40:23.210
(sighs)

40:26.180 --> 40:28.110
Last chance, Victor...

40:29.160 --> 40:31.150
or there will be a bomb.

40:35.000 --> 40:35.220
-(door opens)

40:55.120 --> 40:57.060
-Charlie: Anything interesting happen, Al?

40:58.070 --> 41:02.120
-Mayor Ortega's planning to rip off a big-time hash dealer, called Silvia Garcia.

41:02.130 --> 41:04.000
Just can't figure out exactly how yet.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.230
But if I can figure it out, I think...

41:07.000 --> 41:09.090
it might be quite difficult for our mate, the mayor, to handle.

41:11.150 --> 41:12.200
How'd you get on?

41:12.210 --> 41:16.010
-Uh...it's been, uh, quite an eventful day.

41:17.110 --> 41:19.210
-We know where Ortega's stash spot is.

41:22.130 --> 41:24.050
-You've figured out where our money is.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.160
-Vic: No, son, that would've been me.

41:27.170 --> 41:29.150
And Charlie, Lotti, and I have decided we...

41:29.160 --> 41:33.000
are gonna take it back. We're done fucking about here, son.

41:33.010 --> 41:35.050
-I've got something else in play at the moment, Dad, all right?

41:35.060 --> 41:37.070
So if we're gonna pull this off, we have to work together.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.130
-Well, let's work together.

41:40.020 --> 41:43.030
But as sure as I'm standing here, we are going in.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.140
-Will someone tell me what's going on so I can go out and cause some damage?

41:51.100 --> 41:53.010
-(Charlie and Lotti chuckle)

41:58.190 --> 41:59.160
-(car door squeaks open)
