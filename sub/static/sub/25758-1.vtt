[mouthing]

29:07.996 --> 29:08.872
Ugh.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.541
I feel like Owen set this whole thing up

29:11.624 --> 29:14.461
because he knew I wouldn't have service
in the middle of the ocean.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.962
-Loser.
-Yeah.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.716
He had nerve wanting the person
he was spending time with

29:19.799 --> 29:21.634
to actually pay attention to him.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.304
Why are you here, Harry?

29:26.848 --> 29:28.850
Well, you practically forced me
into that town car.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.226
You may not remember,

29:30.310 --> 29:31.644
-but you were aggressive.
-Uh-uh.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.646
I don't care why you're on the cruise.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.275
Why are you here... after all this time?

29:38.359 --> 29:39.235
Why now? Okay.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.282
You want to do this now?

29:47.577 --> 29:48.620
Leaving you was--

29:48.703 --> 29:51.164
Please don't give me some rehearsed speech

29:51.456 --> 29:53.833
with a bunch of lame excuses
about why you left.

29:53.917 --> 29:57.170
I don't care why you left.
I really don't give a shit why you left.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.130
Okay? I care while you're here.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.674
You showed up on my wedding day.

30:01.758 --> 30:05.261
Now you're acting like we're best friends
who have spent our lives together. Why?

30:08.348 --> 30:09.390
Why now, Harry?

30:11.100 --> 30:11.935
Well...

30:12.352 --> 30:15.772
-Gabe, my partner...
-Oh, shit, you're gay?

30:16.272 --> 30:18.316
Oh, I didn't know you were gay.
No one told me that.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.651
[chuckling] You think I'm gay?

30:19.734 --> 30:22.904
Not that there'd be anything
wrong with it if I was, but... no.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.489
Gabe is my <i>work </i>partner.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.950
We built a successful business together.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.954
But, uh, I had some...
some time off from work. And...

30:31.621 --> 30:33.790
Gabe always says it's never too late.
So, here I am.

30:33.873 --> 30:37.752
Oh. So, you had time off,
and then your friend told you to come.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.046
-Okay. I'm gonna get hash browns.
-I wanted to come, too--

30:40.129 --> 30:41.506
-No, that's--
-Hash browns?

30:41.589 --> 30:44.592
I got extra for the table,
and I don't eat them. Too many carbs.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.220
So glad you lovebirds
could finally join us.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.180

-[man 2] You must be Rachel and Owen.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.765
We're your assigned tablemates.

This is my gorgeous boyfriend, Steve.
I'm Jim.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.894
From San Francisco. Been dating two years.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.105
That is Shirley and Leonard
from Palm Beach.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.439
-Hi.
-[Jim] Look at their outfits.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.358
Are they not the cutest thing? I love 'em.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.318
-They are celebrating, get this...
-[chuckles]

31:02.402 --> 31:04.654
-...their 50th wedding anniversary.
-Congratulations.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.322
-[Shirley] Thank you.
-[Jim] Dan and Beth.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.241
Second marriage for them both.
The right one.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.076
And... from Wichita?

31:10.285 --> 31:11.911
-Yes. Very impressive, Jim.
-You're right.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.080
-[Jim] Why, thank you.
-Jim's insanely good

31:14.163 --> 31:16.040
at remembering things about people.
It's...

31:16.124 --> 31:19.627
part of what makes him a good therapist,
and it's gonna make him such a good dad.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.296
-[Jim] We're adopting.
-[Steve] Yeah.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.798
We're on the waiting list,
so, don't wanna jinx it.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.467
We're manifesting.
If we think it, it's gonna happen.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.304
-[Steve] How did you guys meet?
-[Jim] Yeah, what's your story?

31:29.387 --> 31:30.889
-How'd you catch the silver fox?
-Mm.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.224
[sighs]

31:33.933 --> 31:36.895
Hi, I'm Harry, actually, Rachel's dad.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.856
Rachel and Owen
decided not to get married,

31:39.939 --> 31:41.190
so she invited me to come.

31:42.275 --> 31:45.695
You see, I left her...
when she was five years old.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.072
It's unforgivable. I know.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.160
So, I showed up
at their wedding a few days ago,

31:52.243 --> 31:55.872
and Owen decided to be a little bitch
and leave Rachel at the altar.

31:55.955 --> 31:59.125
So, I took Rachel out and got her good
and drunk, and, uh, we're here.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.919
[chuckles] It's nice to meet you all,

32:01.002 --> 32:04.756
but we're gonna be getting off the ship
when it docks in Jamaica tomorrow.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.634
So you see, we have very little time,
and um...

32:10.053 --> 32:12.555
I'd like to congratulate all of you
for your love.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.141
That's really great.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.228

of lemon wedges? Thank you.

32:20.563 --> 32:21.981
-Hi, I'm Rachel.
-[Leonard] Hi.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.691
-[Dan] Hey. Hey, Rachel.
-Nice to meet you.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.526
I don't think you needed to know
all of that,

32:25.610 --> 32:26.986
but now you do, so...

32:27.070 --> 32:28.488
Sorry that we're leaving tomorrow.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.530
Not as sorry as we are.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.408
I mean, this is more interesting
than what they got in the brochure.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.701
-Honey.
-Yeah. I'm sorry.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.162
You guys hadn't seen
or spoken to each other in how long?

32:36.245 --> 32:37.914
-Twenty-five years.
-Twenty-six.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.374
-Wow.
-I see.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.417
So, why don't you just stay with us?

32:41.501 --> 32:43.544
-[Beth] Yeah.
-We're really good people.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.338
At least come hang out with us today.

32:45.421 --> 32:47.882
Leonard and Shirley were nice enough
to get us a private table

32:47.966 --> 32:49.801
in the adults-only section of the pool.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.511
-No kids.
-Mm-hmm.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.972
-Don't nothing ruin a vacation like kids.
-Mm-mm.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.808
That's nice, but no thanks.
I have a lot of work to do.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.852
May I ask all of you a question?

33:00.478 --> 33:01.813
Who here likes potato chips?

33:01.896 --> 33:04.649
-[overlapping chatter]
-[Harry] See? There. Job done.

You call them bachelor parties.

-Mm-hmm.
-It was fun.

It was expensive.

-Excuse me.
-Um, what brings you on the cruise?

-Yes, of course.

-Wow.

if it was his 200th birthday.

[clicks tongue] Actually,
Jeff, if you can believe it,

36:05.121 --> 36:07.540
I was left at the altar a few days ago.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.918
Uh, and my dad, who I haven't seen
since I was five years old,

36:11.002 --> 36:14.046
showed up to my wedding unannounced.
We got drunk together the next night,

36:14.130 --> 36:17.592
and I dragged him on this cruise
that was supposed to be my honeymoon.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.097
Pfft. That's fucked up.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.602
Well, I, uh...

36:28.561 --> 36:30.563
My wife left me a few months ago.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.983
And my sister brought me on this cruise
to kind of...

36:34.567 --> 36:35.526
cheer me up.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.611
I guess it's working.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.321
I developed a mantra...

36:38.404 --> 36:41.490
Well, I didn't develop it,
I read it in a book. But it's this:

36:42.074 --> 36:45.536
"Yesterday's the past,
tomorrow's the future, today's a gift.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.413
[both] That's why they call it
the present."

36:47.496 --> 36:48.331
I've heard it.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.416
-[Jeff] Pretty good. You heard that?
-Yeah.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.085
It's-- it's a kind of...
Like, it's a well known phrase.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.923
-[Jeff] Oh. I never heard it. I read it.
-[Jim] Oh, sexy rabbi alert.

-But we're leaving tomorrow, actually.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.980
So, maybe if I see you before then...

37:14.273 --> 37:18.361
we can, I don't know, hang out,
live in the present... or something?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.446
Sure. Uh, yes.

on the cruise ship,

37:34.710 --> 37:35.920

into the sold-out Gigantic Game Show.

1:00:33.212 --> 1:00:35.465

who was around physically,

1:00:35.548 --> 1:00:37.842
but wishing he was somewhere else,
and...

1:00:38.009 --> 1:00:39.677

I should go back to work.

1:00:46.434 --> 1:00:47.435

1:00:48.561 --> 1:00:50.480
it started to feel like a release.

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:52.023
Not from you, but...

1:00:53.608 --> 1:00:56.235

that wasn't very happy.

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:04.577
So that's it?
You-- you couldn't come visit?

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.663
You had to disappear completely?

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:13.461
I guess you were too young to remember.
I came back every week.

1:01:15.296 --> 1:01:16.130
But...

1:01:20.218 --> 1:01:21.469

you were better without me there.

1:01:30.853 --> 1:01:31.771
And, uh...

1:01:33.856 --> 1:01:35.566
Finally, I just didn't come back.

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:39.404

Maybe Owen wasn't such a fucker after all.

1:11:03.968 --> 1:11:05.302
This was his idea.

1:11:11.016 --> 1:11:13.143
I think maybe I'm an asshole.

1:11:13.227 --> 1:11:16.939
Owen and I dated in college,
and we eventually broke up and lost touch.

1:11:17.022 --> 1:11:20.651
And then, I met up with Owen again
three months after my mom died.

1:11:20.734 --> 1:11:22.778
Three months after that, he proposed...

1:11:24.071 --> 1:11:25.281
and I said yes...

1:11:27.408 --> 1:11:29.868
because he felt familiar.

1:11:30.786 --> 1:11:32.538
Because he felt like family.

1:11:34.123 --> 1:11:35.457
And I did not...

She was alone...

1:11:56.770 --> 1:11:57.771

1:12:02.693 --> 1:12:04.069
I'm sorry.

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:09.158
I just never should have said yes to Owen.

I'm not sure why they even
have these on a cruise ship.

1:13:06.882 --> 1:13:08.217
What do you think? I got you one.

1:13:08.300 --> 1:13:10.344
-Did you charge that to the room?
-What?

1:13:10.427 --> 1:13:13.222
Because I just got a call
telling me that you're fucking bankrupt.

1:13:13.305 --> 1:13:15.557

-No.

Your bankruptcy payments are late.
Because I'm your daughter,

1:13:23.273 --> 1:13:26.610
they wanted to know where I was.
Okay. Is that why you came to find me?

1:13:26.693 --> 1:13:28.487
Because you wanted to get me
before they did?

1:13:29.071 --> 1:13:30.364
I can't believe I trusted you.

1:13:30.447 --> 1:13:32.866
Oh, my God, I'm so stupid.
I want you out of my room.

1:13:33.158 --> 1:13:34.952
You are a selfish, cold-hearted,

1:13:35.285 --> 1:13:36.578
-horrible human being.
-Rachel.

1:13:36.662 --> 1:13:39.039
Was it not enough you left me
when I was five?

1:13:39.164 --> 1:13:40.582
Now you're trying to steal my money.

1:13:40.666 --> 1:13:43.377

-No!

You can stay. Stay.

-Gabe is dead!

1:13:58.517 --> 1:13:59.435
What?

1:14:00.436 --> 1:14:02.604
He died. Two months ago.

1:14:06.066 --> 1:14:08.277
I promise you, I'm not after your money.

1:14:09.570 --> 1:14:11.572
[sniffles] Yes, I'm bankrupt.

1:14:12.614 --> 1:14:16.326
And I owe a fair amount.
But I promise you, I'm dealing with it.

1:14:17.369 --> 1:14:18.829
That was not why I came to find you.

1:14:18.912 --> 1:14:21.373
I am sorry.
They should never have called you.

1:14:34.428 --> 1:14:35.345

He was all I had in the world, and...

1:14:45.063 --> 1:14:46.023
now I'm alone.

1:14:47.357 --> 1:14:48.901
So I came looking for you.

1:14:49.401 --> 1:14:52.988
I'm sorry. That's not fair to you, but...
that is the truth.

1:14:55.199 --> 1:14:56.950
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

1:14:57.034 --> 1:14:59.578
I-- I wanted to, but... [chuckles]

1:14:59.703 --> 1:15:03.081
...you were going through your own stuff,
anyway and...

1:15:04.124 --> 1:15:05.209
Well, honestly...

1:15:05.334 --> 1:15:09.004
being with you, it was nice just to forget
about everything that happened.

1:15:13.258 --> 1:15:14.510
So that's Gabe?

1:15:19.556 --> 1:15:21.099
-[sniffles]
-What happened to him?

1:15:26.021 --> 1:15:27.022
[clicks tongue]

1:15:28.190 --> 1:15:29.775
He was always the organized one.

1:15:31.193 --> 1:15:32.945
We traveled around the world
for business,

1:15:33.028 --> 1:15:35.656
and he would make sure
we got where we were going,

1:15:35.739 --> 1:15:37.741
and when we were supposed to get there. He'd look after the details, you know.

1:15:42.829 --> 1:15:44.665
Then he started making mistakes.

1:15:47.459 --> 1:15:48.961
He'd get confused and...

1:15:50.629 --> 1:15:51.713
repeat himself.

1:15:53.632 --> 1:15:56.593
When the doctors told us
it was early-onset Alzheimer's,

1:15:57.803 --> 1:15:58.804
we were... [sighs]

1:15:59.638 --> 1:16:01.431
He was just 52 years old.

1:16:04.935 --> 1:16:08.730
We'd lost most of our clients by then,
because of the mistakes and...

1:16:10.899 --> 1:16:13.402
he didn't have any family
to look after him.

1:16:16.572 --> 1:16:17.698
So I quit working...

1:16:18.949 --> 1:16:20.450
and moved him in with me.

1:16:21.827 --> 1:16:24.788
Eventually,
I couldn't look after him alone anymore.

1:16:25.330 --> 1:16:27.916
Had to hire some help,
and that's where the money went.

1:16:28.792 --> 1:16:29.835
[chuckles softly]

1:16:30.627 --> 1:16:31.587
Anyway...

1:16:32.045 --> 1:16:35.716
I was gonna spread his ashes in New York,
'cause that's where he's from.

1:16:37.843 --> 1:16:39.011
So, he was...

1:16:40.429 --> 1:16:43.140
with me that night when we, you know...

1:16:43.849 --> 1:16:47.436
[chuckling] So, along he came.
I figured...

1:16:48.061 --> 1:16:49.896
the Caribbean was nicer anyway.

1:16:53.442 --> 1:16:54.860
Wow. [clears throat]

1:17:06.580 --> 1:17:08.582

[chuckles]

1:17:09.541 --> 1:17:11.168
[crying] I don't want your money.

1:17:12.169 --> 1:17:13.420
I sold my house,

1:17:13.629 --> 1:17:16.340
and I'm just waiting on
some paperwork to go through, and...

1:17:16.423 --> 1:17:17.758
I've even started packing up.

1:17:17.841 --> 1:17:20.844
I'm gonna finish the job
when I get back from the cruise.

1:17:23.347 --> 1:17:24.306
[sniffles]

1:17:25.515 --> 1:17:28.769
-Where are you gonna go?
-I'll get an apartment or something.

1:17:30.604 --> 1:17:33.732
A little late in the game
for me to get a job-job, but...

1:17:34.524 --> 1:17:36.068
I can do some consulting.

1:17:36.485 --> 1:17:39.488
I'm gonna be just fine.
You don't have to worry about me.

1:17:43.909 --> 1:17:47.079
So I guess we should karaoke
in Gabe's honor. [chuckles softly]

Jim, what if it's a daughter?

1:24:44.329 --> 1:24:45.246
Gabe-ette.

1:24:45.789 --> 1:24:48.249
Gabriella's actually a girl's name.
Let's just do Gabriella.

-We could do that.
-[chuckles] It's okay, you two.

You don't need to do that.

1:24:54.047 --> 1:24:56.716
The reason I didn't tell you all
about Gabe was because...

1:24:57.884 --> 1:24:59.844
I didn't want to believe he was gone.

1:25:01.554 --> 1:25:04.140

The last thing Gabe would want

1:26:11.374 --> 1:26:13.835
would be for us to be all mopey.

Why don't we all head back inside
and enjoy one final night of...

1:26:47.076 --> 1:26:49.454

but...

1:26:50.914 --> 1:26:52.749

1:35:23.551 --> 1:35:25.553
[doorbell rings] [Jim] I don't care how successful
you were,

1:35:34.103 --> 1:35:36.105
there is never a need for 278 ties.

1:35:36.689 --> 1:35:39.233
You can't even wear the ones you like
that often. It is insane.

1:35:39.734 --> 1:35:41.777
That is not a word I'm supposed to use
with patients.

1:35:41.861 --> 1:35:43.696
I'm not one of your patients.

1:35:45.823 --> 1:35:46.657
All right, then.

1:36:00.796 --> 1:36:01.714
Oh, shit.

1:36:02.673 --> 1:36:05.760
-Hi, Steve.
-[Jim] You saw her. Now shut the door.

1:36:08.554 --> 1:36:10.973
[clears throat]
I had a few extra vacation days.

1:36:11.265 --> 1:36:13.809
Well, like nine years' worth,
so I figured I'd...

1:36:14.268 --> 1:36:15.978
[clicks tongue] ...take some.

1:36:32.995 --> 1:36:34.288
I love you, Rachel.

1:36:35.998 --> 1:36:38.083
-I never stopped loving you.
-[sniffles]

1:36:39.293 --> 1:36:40.628
Thank you for coming here.

1:36:41.587 --> 1:36:43.756
-It's more than I deserve.
-[crying]

1:36:47.426 --> 1:36:48.260
[sighs]

1:36:51.972 --> 1:36:53.682
You don't have to say you love me,
you know.

1:36:53.974 --> 1:36:56.811
[laughs, sniffles]

1:37:00.689 --> 1:37:02.817
How about I just start by becoming inside?

1:37:03.859 --> 1:37:04.860
Good plan.
