WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.171
Previously on Scorpion...
We need to bail ourselves

00:03.204 --> 00:04.038
out of a half million dollar
debt.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.739
I'll submit to the board
after school.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.509
Speaking of which,
I've never had a tardy before.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.411
And I'm not starting now.
And you're not starting now.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.780
Hey, Patty.
Yup.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.717
Really don't like
this development.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.752
My name is Florence Tipton.
I'm your new neighbor.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.354
I just set up my lab

00:20.388 --> 00:22.256
in the adjoining warehouse,
and I cannot function

00:22.290 --> 00:23.324
with all this distraction.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.492
I'm still not sure about her.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.626
PAIGE:
I'm gonna give her a chance,

00:25.659 --> 00:27.461
and I think you should, too.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.263
I rule that the defendant

00:29.297 --> 00:31.132
is not guilty as
a matter of law.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.735
Mr. Gallo, you are free to go.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.137
(grunts)

00:36.170 --> 00:38.506
Stack the canisters
under the pallet.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.174
There is a shot at survival

00:40.208 --> 00:41.809
if we submerge her
in ballistic gel.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.446
You helped keep my team
together, so thank you.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.116
You're welcome.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.820
♪ It's gonna be
a kick-ass Christmas... ♪

00:52.853 --> 00:54.688
Hey, boss, bend your ear

00:54.722 --> 00:56.657
for a sec?
No. Busy.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.531
You are a menace. What?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.800
Okay, it's Christmas Eve, and I
haven't gotten Toby a gift yet.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.437
First married Christmas,
so it's got to be good.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.106
You've known him longer,
and I suck at gifts,

01:12.140 --> 01:13.141
so, advice.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.542
Scented candle.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.610
They're affordable and
long-lasting, and it's proven

01:16.644 --> 01:18.579
the pleasant
olfactory stimulation

01:18.612 --> 01:20.614
enhances brain function.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.849
You're welcome.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.319
Scented candle? Seriously?

01:25.353 --> 01:26.820
(pouring coffee)

01:26.854 --> 01:30.358
Oh, you use Cabe's Kings mug,
and he will kill you.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.396
Seeing that I just
saved your life,

01:35.429 --> 01:37.298
you owe me one good
present idea.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.602
Almost ready to go?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.204
Sure am, boss.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.305
Thanks.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.906
Mm-hmm. SYLVESTER:
I can't release it

01:45.939 --> 01:48.609
like this. Of course you
can, so stop stressing.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.479
It's defective.
PATTY: To you.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.480
No one else will notice.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.514
Notice what?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.316
The anti-bullying video game

01:55.349 --> 01:57.418
I'm making
for West Altadenia schools.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.353
The rendering code
has a bug.

01:59.387 --> 02:03.257
I could actually really use
your help figuring this out.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.160
The deadline is today.
I've never had a tardy.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.428
And besides, who would
even notice the glitch?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.596
SYLVESTER:
I would.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.231
There is a visual glitch

02:10.264 --> 02:11.899
that skips 1/1000
of a frame.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.701
Which no human eye can detect.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.870
Video games? Kids need books,
not more screen time.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.706
Seriously, Sylvester,

02:18.739 --> 02:20.241
when are you gonna put
your childhood away?

02:21.709 --> 02:22.676
It's almost time to leave.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.679
O'Brien, penny
for your thoughts.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.880
How about a dime
to leave me alone?

02:26.914 --> 02:28.148
Right after you
riddle me this.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.818
See, you've known Happy longer
than I have, so I'm wondering...

02:30.851 --> 02:32.953
Scented candle. Now pack up.
We're leaving soon, and...

02:32.986 --> 02:34.655
I already packed.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.856
Paige,

02:35.889 --> 02:39.693
this is a quick job, so this
bag's a little bit excessive.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.463
In fact, everyone
is overpacking.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.831
Oh, Walter,
I hate to break it

02:43.864 --> 02:46.267
to you, but no one is packing
for the job.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.601
I don't understand. Why not?

02:47.635 --> 02:48.569
Because it's Christmas Eve.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.570
We all made other plans.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.372
I wrote an e-mail confirmation

02:51.405 --> 02:54.542
to the whole team
specifically for this job.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.643
And how many responses
did you get?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.578
I thought that no news
was good news.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.613
Wrong. No news is good-bye.
We're not doing

02:59.647 --> 03:00.681
a corporate gig
on Christmas Eve.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.616
We just got Cabe's
bail money back,

03:02.650 --> 03:04.952
so we're basically back to
zero on the balance sheet.

03:04.985 --> 03:07.621
We have to refill Scorpion's coffers.
And I thought

03:07.655 --> 03:09.690
I could lure you away.
I got a cabin in Big Bear.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.792
I was gonna surprise you,
but as soon as we came in,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.294
all you could talk about
was being ready

03:13.327 --> 03:14.628
for the server-update job.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.665
It's because I'm looking out
for o financial interests.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.733
We're getting paid
double time.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.834
Dude, it's Christmas Eve.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.336
Did my e-mail not mention

03:22.370 --> 03:23.637
a post-job team meal?

03:23.671 --> 03:24.505
That's festive.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.807
And I quote, "We'll work
for a few hours,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.610
then grab a bite at Kovelsky's
at the end of the night."

03:29.643 --> 03:31.545
That's sad, not festive.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.452
Oh, this is a Christmas mutiny.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.822
Forgive me and Toby if we want
to finally have our honeymoon.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.724
City of West
Altadenia is throwing

03:43.757 --> 03:45.726
a holiday fair--
toy drive,

03:45.759 --> 03:46.960
games for the kids.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.629
There's gonna be a meal service

03:48.662 --> 03:50.531
from the food pantry
for families less fortunate.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.665
Arranged it all myself.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.302
Young person, why are you
always here, monopolizing

03:54.335 --> 03:55.669
my employees' time?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.671
Actually, he doesn't mind
you being in the garage.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.639
Actually, I do.
You're like

03:58.672 --> 04:00.741
a Canadian penny
I can't seem to get rid of.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.343
Hey, Patty's my intern.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.712
Not a problem. Next
legislative session,

04:04.745 --> 04:07.281
Alderman Dodd and I will conduct
our business at City Hall.

04:07.315 --> 04:10.651
(watch beeps)
Anyway, I got to head home

04:10.684 --> 04:12.620
for Christmas Eve
dinner with my family.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.755
I've never had a tardy and...

04:14.788 --> 04:16.624
ALL:
And you're not starting now.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.725
Merry Christmas,
everyone.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.893
Even you, Grinch.
Excuse me?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.995
Green creature?
I'm not a Grinch.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.531
Copy that, Scrooge.

04:23.564 --> 04:24.665
RALPH:
Are you kidding me, Walter?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.534
I want her spending
more time here,

04:26.567 --> 04:27.835
not less.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.838
I guess that's our cue, too.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.307
So, that's it?
You're all leaving me

04:33.341 --> 04:34.542
to do the work on my own?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.709
There's plenty of time
for corporate gigs

04:35.743 --> 04:36.977
in the new year, boss.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.313
We could have all
had a good time today.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.914
Yeah, sure. We don't need

04:40.948 --> 04:42.316
to spend every minute
together, people.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.484
You know what?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.719
I'll do the job myself.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.855
I don't need your
help. I don't need

04:47.888 --> 04:49.623
any of you.
(typing)

04:54.828 --> 04:56.797
Walt, I don't want
to curse at you at Christmas,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.699
so we're all just gonna go.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.771
Ralph, go put our stuff
in the car, okay?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.573
(door opens)

05:05.606 --> 05:06.740
Walter,

05:06.774 --> 05:09.977
I know you're worried
about Scorpion,

05:10.010 --> 05:11.912
but the company
is gonna pull through.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.715
And everyone needs
time off now and then.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.817
So, if you're asking,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.752
I don't think you're on
the right side of this one.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.422
But I respect your right
to make this decision,

05:21.455 --> 05:23.056
so I'm just gonna text
you the cabin's address

05:23.090 --> 05:25.559
in case you want to drive up,
spend Christmas together.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.627
I just have

05:26.660 --> 05:29.797
so many proposals to get
through, but-but how about

05:29.830 --> 05:32.900
you and Ralph stay here?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.602
And then I can power
through the paperwork,

05:34.635 --> 05:38.606
and by late afternoon, we can
enjoy some yuletide cheer?

05:38.639 --> 05:40.741
We spend 364 days a year
here in this garage.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.643
I'm not gonna have Ralph
spend Christmas here, too.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.079
So we're gonna go.
I hope you reconsider.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.048
Love you.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.083
Reciprocated.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.790
Well, Allie's with her
family in Denver.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.658
Looks like it's

05:57.691 --> 06:00.561
you and me and a knish
from Kovelsky's.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.962
A six-hour job just

06:01.995 --> 06:04.131
doubled because
I'm doing it by myself,

06:04.164 --> 06:05.899
so Kovelsky's is off the table.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.535
Well, I can help

06:07.568 --> 06:09.570
speed things along.
It's a server upgrade.

06:09.603 --> 06:13.807
An insurance company, so,
your skills don't really apply.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.744
Okay. Well...

06:18.846 --> 06:20.914
Have a nice Christmas.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.450
You, too.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.588
Love to see how
you'd all fare on your own.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.956
I don't need them.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.426
I'm gonna have a kick-ass
Christmas all by myself.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.498
♪ It's gonna be
a kick-ass Christmas ♪

06:37.531 --> 06:38.899

(groans softly)

06:51.512 --> 06:53.514

06:55.849 --> 06:57.818
This is curious.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.853
Where's everyone else's desks?

07:08.862 --> 07:11.198
(train whistle blows)

07:11.231 --> 07:14.101
Odd.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.672
Hello?

07:24.211 --> 07:27.214
(piano continues playing
"O Come, All Ye Faithful")

07:28.682 --> 07:30.484
Paige?

07:30.518 --> 07:32.586
Oh, I feel weird.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.623
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

07:35.656 --> 07:37.491
Honey, you startled me.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.494
Did you say something?

07:40.528 --> 07:41.962
I didn't hear you
over the music.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.130
(music stops)

07:44.998 --> 07:47.635
Looks like somebody fell asleep
at their desk again.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.670
Hi.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.778
We're married?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.514
Yes. Last time I checked.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.951
You could use some coffee.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.919
Think I'm hallucinating.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.222
Here.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.892
No, not Cabe's mug.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.093
He'll kill me.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.227
Who's Cabe?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.296
Okay, just what
is going on?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.865
What's going on is

08:17.898 --> 08:20.801
that you clearly didn't get
enough sleep last night.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.605
Come on, grab your gear.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.239
We got to get to campus.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.776
It's going to be
totally deserted.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.911
Today will be
our most productive day

08:30.944 --> 08:33.681
of the entire year.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.315
Can you do me a favor

08:35.348 --> 08:37.951
and grab the paper
for me, please?

08:43.123 --> 08:45.626
Merry Christmas.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.270
We stopped that.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.173
(soft, rhythmic clattering)

09:13.186 --> 09:14.622
Strange.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.990
(person whistling)

09:17.024 --> 09:19.059
Hello?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.361
Feliz Navidad, amigo!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.096
Ray?
Hey.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.665
What are you doing here?
Hell if I know.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.166
You imagined me.

09:26.199 --> 09:30.337
But my guess is, it's got
something to do with that.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.975
MAN:
Help! Help!

09:35.008 --> 09:37.010
Help! I'm hurt!

09:37.044 --> 09:38.746
Hello?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.013
Help!

09:40.047 --> 09:41.114
I'm stuck in here!

09:43.150 --> 09:44.284
You okay, muchacho?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.022
Oh, boy.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.658
That's weird.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.061
Ray, what the hell
is going on?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.096
Listen, you need
to focus, friend.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.198
Now we both know you took a
half gainer down the stairs.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.201
You're on the garage floor,
unconscious, bleeding out.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.335
WALTER (in car):
Someone help me, please.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.237
What am I supposed to do about him?
Well, my guess is,

10:04.271 --> 10:06.273
Extra Walter in there
is a manifestation

10:06.306 --> 10:08.141
of your real-life
physical state.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.078
So if I save him, I save myself?
No, no, no.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.313
Saving him is you
fighting to stay alive.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.182
And I think you may
have some help.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.118
Listen.
FLORENCE: Cabe?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.954
You have to stop the others
from leaving, and you have to

10:20.988 --> 10:23.156
get back to the garage. I just
came in to give him my present,

10:23.190 --> 10:24.992
and I found him
bleeding on the ground.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.360
I did call 911,
and they said ten minutes,

10:27.394 --> 10:30.764
but I am telling you,
he does not have ten minutes!

10:32.900 --> 10:34.902
♪

10:42.209 --> 10:43.977
I know what's happening. A
neurological study... Yep.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.979
...of postmortem rats
showed brain activity

10:46.013 --> 10:47.214
up to 30 seconds
after death.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.849
Low gamma waves
actually spiked,

10:48.882 --> 10:51.118
creating a heightened
state of consciousness

10:51.151 --> 10:52.753
before permanent
unconsciousness.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.856
So if I am at heightened
unconsciousness,

10:55.889 --> 10:57.858
I can use it to my advantage,
force myself to wake up,

10:57.891 --> 10:58.826
and then get help.
Sure thing,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.794
Cool Breeze-- go for it.
Okay.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.435
(low, strained grunting)

11:12.105 --> 11:14.074
Yeah. Didn't seem to
have worked, did it?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.776
(strained grunting nearby)

11:15.809 --> 11:17.945
WALTER: I'm doing worse in there.
Which means

11:17.978 --> 11:19.780
you're doing worse
in the real world.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.114
But you better
think of something,

11:21.148 --> 11:22.950
'cause if Car Walter goes down...
(taps on car)

11:22.983 --> 11:24.918
this is a dream you
don't wake up from.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.887
Ray, I need your help.
No can do.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.388
I'm merely the tour
guide on this ride.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.757
I don't know what to do.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.924
CABE:
Hello, Angelinos.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.326
This is your LAPD chief,
Cabe Gallo,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.930
reminding you our toy drive
is still going strong,

11:36.964 --> 11:39.900
accepting donations to spread
joy this holiday season.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.935
Since when is Cabe
the police chief?

11:41.969 --> 11:44.304
Listen... this whole
world was created

11:44.337 --> 11:46.339
by your axons, your
neurons misfiring

11:46.373 --> 11:48.075
while your body
shuts down.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.277
And they're gonna get real wonky
as your condition worsens.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.912
Easiest way to put it:

11:51.945 --> 11:54.047
things change around here.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.784
Okay, I just got to calm down
and figure this out.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.751
On your own?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.519
While you're bleeding
to death. Walter...

11:59.552 --> 12:02.823
you can't do this
on your own.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.825
You're right.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.960
I'm gonna go find Cabe.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.930
Flo, Flo, get out of the way!

12:09.963 --> 12:13.366
Happy, can you grab my med bag?
He's breathing really fast.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.069
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's
low and shallow.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.070
Looks like he sliced

12:17.104 --> 12:18.271
his superficial
temporal artery.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.406
He lost a lot of blood.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.407
Can you get another towel?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.975
This one's soaked.

12:22.009 --> 12:22.675
Med bag.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.411
Happy, keep the
pressure on.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.614
What are you doing?
Glasgow Coma Scale.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.818
No, I don't think he's
responding to our voices.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.786
Walter! Walt!

12:32.820 --> 12:34.054
Open your eyes!

12:34.087 --> 12:35.088
There's nothing.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.223
I'm pressing his
nail bed with a pen.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.958
Well, he's reflexive to pain,

12:37.991 --> 12:39.927
but he's unresponsive--
that's a six out of 15.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.062
Bad? Three is the
lowest possible score.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.068
He's got a blown pupil.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.269
What does a blown pupil mean?

12:49.302 --> 12:50.537
It means there's bleeding
between his skull and his brain.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.074
I-It's pushing the brain through
the opening at the skull's base.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.443
He's dead if that pressure
isn't relieved immediately.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.511
Well, then grab something
from your med bag and fix it!

12:58.545 --> 13:00.981
There's nothing in my
med bag that can fix this!

13:01.014 --> 13:03.917
But there is something
in Happy's toolbox.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.155
Excuse me? Excuse me?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.522
I need to speak

13:09.556 --> 13:11.892
with Cabe Gallo immediately!
Hey, keep it down!

13:11.925 --> 13:14.594
Patty? What are
you doing here?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.930
It's Sergeant Logan,
and I work here.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.498
We need to speak
with Cabe now.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.033
A few things.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.369
One, you seem to have
a problem with titles.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.604
It's Chief of Police Cabe Gallo.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.705
Two, he doesn't
take walk-ins.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.375
He rarely talks to the people
who actually work here.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.177
And three, who's "we"?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.045
Totally forgot.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.047
You're the only one
who can see me.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.315
WALTER:
I'm sorry.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.317
It's just me. Alone.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.319
Are you sure you
don't recognize me?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.989
Negative. But if you're
as crazy as you seem to be,

13:42.022 --> 13:43.957
I'm sure I'll get an APB
any minute now

13:43.991 --> 13:45.893
about some loony escaped
from the bin.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.595
Oh, she is as salty
as the Dead Sea.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.931
Which, by the way, has an
average salinity rating of 34%.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.066
What are you doing? Hey, you're
the one making me jabber

13:53.100 --> 13:54.301
this gibberish.
Now, are you gonna take charge

13:54.334 --> 13:57.304
of the situation, or you gonna
get shut down by a teen tyrant?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.508
Cabe? Cabe Gallo!

14:01.541 --> 14:03.576
Cabe Gallo!
I will stun you, sir.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.012
Cabe Gallo!

14:05.045 --> 14:05.879
Chief Gallo!

14:05.913 --> 14:08.882
What the hell
is going on out here?

14:08.916 --> 14:09.649
Cabe, you got to listen to me.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.218
And who the hell
are you?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.619
Uh, my name is Walter O'Brien.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.622
I run a team of geniuses
tackling worldwide threats

14:15.655 --> 14:16.990
that only we can solve.

14:17.024 --> 14:17.991
RAY: No, no,
no-- here,

14:18.025 --> 14:19.226
you're a professor at USC,

14:19.259 --> 14:21.061
married to your wife Florence.
I don't work

14:21.094 --> 14:22.896
at USC, and I'm
not married to Florence.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.631
Good for you.
I don't work at Six Flags,

14:24.664 --> 14:26.233
and I'm not married
to Big Bird.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.435
Now, you got one minute
to get out of here,

14:28.468 --> 14:30.470
before you're cuffed
for disturbing the peace.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.272
Told you he doesn't like
talking to people.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.540
I...

14:33.573 --> 14:34.674
(mumbling)

14:34.707 --> 14:38.045
Uh... listen, I'm sorry to
bother you, but there was

14:38.078 --> 14:41.114
an accident, a guy's
trapped, and he could die.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.016
So call 911, get traffic
control over there.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.018
No go-- it's Christmas Eve.
We're short-staffed.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.120
Most of my people
are home with their family.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.122
And maybe you ought
to be, too, son.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.991
You might not know
my rep,

14:51.024 --> 14:52.960
but I don't suffer fools.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.962
Now, clear out
of my station house.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.030
This is not hard--
just get a rescue team,

14:57.064 --> 14:58.932
get the Jaws of Life--
this is what you're good at,

14:58.966 --> 15:01.068
for God's sakes!
Actually, it's not.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.070
It's not my skill set.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.406
Oh, I know why you said that--
because I...

15:07.740 --> 15:10.944
Because some thoughtless fool
said that to you once.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.946
But it isn't true-- because...

15:12.980 --> 15:14.714
you have
an incredible skill set,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.316
honed with experience
and knowledge

15:16.349 --> 15:18.651
and-and value, and that's
why I came here to you now.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.154
Because if my life is
on the line, which it is,

15:21.188 --> 15:24.057
then I need Cabe Gallo
on the case.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.659
Still ready with
the Taser, Chief.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.161
At ease, Sergeant.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.164
What are we dealing with?

15:31.198 --> 15:33.100
A driver's leg is pinned
by the console.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.602
His vehicle is jammed between
a car and a one-ton truck.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.604
We're gonna need
an auto specialist.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.372
I know the world's best
mechanic, Happy Quinn.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.640
You mean the host

15:40.673 --> 15:42.109
of The Happy Mechanic
podcast?

15:42.142 --> 15:43.176
Podcast? No.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.744
She works for...
(clears throat)

15:44.777 --> 15:47.547
Yes. That's her.
That's who I mean.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.316
Well, if you get her
to lend a hand, I'm in.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
She broadcasts
from a garage downtown.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.652
Saddle up.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.554
I'll drive.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.092
HAPPY:
This '67

15:59.126 --> 16:01.194
Mustang Shelby GT--
they call it the Eleanor--

16:01.228 --> 16:03.363
has a 351 engine

16:03.396 --> 16:06.399
with 435 horsepower

16:06.433 --> 16:09.202
and tops out
at 150 miles per hour.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.038
And if you are looking

16:11.071 --> 16:13.106
for a place to open up
some sweet rides,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.375
look no further
than this week's sponsor,

16:15.408 --> 16:17.477
the San Dimas Raceway.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.212
For $199, you get

16:19.246 --> 16:21.781
one hour of track time
for your favorite gearhead.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.251
(ringtone playing
"Here Comes The Bride")

16:26.586 --> 16:27.720
What the hell?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.089
Cut!

16:29.122 --> 16:30.323
That girl's
everywhere.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.658
Like sriracha.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.126
You just ruined our recording.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.262
I'm sorry, is there
a problem here, Officer?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.197
This guy thinks there is.

16:37.230 --> 16:41.068
I think he's a few quills short
of a porcupine, if you ask me.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.136
Hi. My name is Walter.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.772
There was a car accident.
We are looking

16:45.805 --> 16:47.040
for the world's best engineer--
that's you.

16:47.074 --> 16:50.743
I'd love to help, but I'm busy
recording my Christmas episode.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.279
Biggest ad revenues of the year.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.047
We have coffers to fill.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.815
Happy, I know that you
think you don't know me,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.151
but in another world,
we're really good friends.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.586
Actually, we were married once.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.221
Not like that.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.490
It was for
citizenship.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.591
Never got physical.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.193
Couldn't close
the deal, huh?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.261
Good-bye, Crazy Walter.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.230
Now, since you
let yourselves in,

17:10.263 --> 17:11.431
you can let yourselves out.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.133
Happy, hold on
a second.

17:13.166 --> 17:13.866
Please, just hold...

17:13.900 --> 17:14.767
one second...
No, you hold on.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.137
I have built this show
from the ground up,

17:17.170 --> 17:19.239
on my own, by myself,
with no one's help.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.241
And you are
screwing it up.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.176
Now, don't let the door
hit you in the ass.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.245
RAY: All right, you walk
out of here without her,

17:25.278 --> 17:27.247
the coroners walk
out of your garage

17:27.280 --> 17:28.748
in just a few minutes.
Okay,

17:28.781 --> 17:30.617
let's pick it up
from the Tobias Curtis ad.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.320
Huh?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.823
You know what,
I'm not leaving.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.325
Oh, I would call the cops,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.727
but they're already here,
doing nothing.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.796
Happy, you take pride in
doing things on your own,

17:43.830 --> 17:46.133
by yourself,
without anybody's help.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.202
But... I know you.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.737
At night, you slow
down your work

17:50.770 --> 17:52.539
so that you're still
here when Patty leaves

17:52.572 --> 17:55.742
so that you can talk to someone
while you walk to your car.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.145
Do you do that, boss?
HAPPY: Shut up.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.380
How do you know that? Because
when you started working with me,

18:00.413 --> 18:01.614
I saw you working slowly.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.549
I critiqued you.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.384
And you were scared
of losing your job,

18:04.417 --> 18:06.653
so it forced you to
tell me the truth.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.489
You hate being alone.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.757
Period.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.762
I've never worked with you,
but...

18:15.795 --> 18:19.132
why do I still feel
like you're telling the truth?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.600
Because we're friends.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.569
I'd never lie to you.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.171
Now, I know that you've
spent your whole life

18:24.204 --> 18:25.505
trying to be
the lone wolf.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.208
But in spite of, uh,
your successful show

18:28.241 --> 18:30.410
and these fancy cars
and everything, you want

18:30.443 --> 18:31.644
a family more
than anything,

18:31.678 --> 18:33.513
because that's something
that you never had.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.515
And this guy, the guy you're
about to read the ad for,

18:35.548 --> 18:38.185
Tobias Curtis, he is
the love of your life.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.420
You just don't know it yet.
And-and I-I can bring

18:40.453 --> 18:41.321
you two together.
I already have.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.623
I've introduced
you before, actually.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.158
You married him
because of me.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.926
I thought you said
she was married to you.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.661
He looks like a jackass.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.264
There is something
about him.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.602
Okay, I'm in.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.204
Okay. Great.
I'll set it up.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.272
Uh, you have to come
with us first. (groans)

18:59.306 --> 19:00.873
RAY: Whoa, whoa.
You're okay.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.243
That's just reality
creeping in.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.411
TOBY:
Keep going.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.912
It'll relieve
the pressure on his brain.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.247
Okay, okay.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.881
Paige says she's on her way.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.218
Oh, I think I'm
gonna be sick.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.285
HAPPY:
Is this uncomfortable for you?

19:12.319 --> 19:14.387
'Cause I'm the one
who's drilling an 1/8-inch bit

19:14.421 --> 19:15.855
into my boss's skull.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.324
Just a little bit further.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.958
Uh, what is that smell?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.261
Microparticles
from Walter's skull.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.595
I came as soon as I heard.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.664
What's going...
(gags)

19:33.706 --> 19:35.508
This isn't the way I left it.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.509
Told ya. Things
change around here.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.245
WALTER: The truck was
right beside the car.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.579
And the other vehicle's
missing.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.314
That ain't how physics works.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.383
And you should know,
being a physics professor.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.452
I'm not a physics professor.
All right, all right.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.420
He likes to shout out
things he isn't.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.556
He also isn't
married to someone

19:49.589 --> 19:50.357
named Florence.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.758
The frame won't support
the weight

19:51.791 --> 19:53.460
of this truck much longer.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.761
This jalopy's gonna be
a pancake in minutes.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.629
(creaking)

19:56.663 --> 19:58.498
Is that your twin or something?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.632
Would you believe me
if I said it was me?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.502
No.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.304
(creaks loudly)
Okay, make that seconds.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.340
From an engineering standpoint,
that is a very negative sound.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.241
This guy needs to be extracted,

20:08.275 --> 20:09.909
or he's gonna be squashed
like a bug.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.478
Please! Please help me!

20:11.511 --> 20:12.879
Don't say that
in front of this guy!

20:12.912 --> 20:14.247
HAPPY:
I'm being blunt.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.449
It's part of my charm.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.484
Just focus on the task at hand.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.420
All right, stand back.
I'm gonna blow this window,

20:20.453 --> 20:22.422
and we'll pull him free. Okay, the
car's integrity will be compromised,

20:22.455 --> 20:24.924
and it'll all come down
in a heap.

20:24.957 --> 20:25.992
WALTER:
She's right.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.294
It's a house of cards.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.362
And that house
is collapsing.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.798
Okay, to buttress
a failing structure,

20:31.831 --> 20:34.467
we need stilts, a crutch.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.835
Oh, how 'bout those?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.471
Film canisters.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.741
We used 'em once to prop up
an eroding nuke

20:41.774 --> 20:42.942
with Paige's mother.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.011
I don't know Paige,
I don't know her mother,

20:45.044 --> 20:47.680
and I don't know why I'm listening
to a madman. RAY: Uh, Walt,

20:47.714 --> 20:49.015
that didn't happen
in this world.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.617
You just sound crazy.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.452
Placement is key.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.854
Follow my direction.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.523
(grunts)

20:56.556 --> 20:58.525
Okay, here, here,

20:58.558 --> 20:59.592
and there.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.594
♪

21:06.933 --> 21:08.435
CABE:
No creaking.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.769
(creaks)

21:09.802 --> 21:11.538
Well, less creaking.
HAPPY: A light breeze

21:11.571 --> 21:13.005
could blow it over.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.607
It's too precarious
for a two-ton truck.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.309
Two-ton? It's a one-ton truck.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.577
Guess again, man. Cargo.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.878
There is no cargo.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.952
Cinder blocks?

21:25.985 --> 21:27.387
What the hell?

21:27.420 --> 21:28.788
If you say
things change around here,

21:28.821 --> 21:29.922
I'm gonna knock you out.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.625
That means
our calculations are off.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.062
We are back to square one on how
to pry open the driver's door

21:36.095 --> 21:38.097
without shifting the load
and weakening the frame.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.567
Well, run
the numbers again.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.801
In real time?
To pull that off,

21:41.834 --> 21:43.636
you'd have to be
a human calculator.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.837
WALTER:
That's it.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.606
We need Sylvester Dodd.
Yeah.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.875
Might as well
grab Zuckerberg and Elon Musk

21:48.908 --> 21:50.910
while you're at it.
Sylvester Dodd is a great guy.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.612
He asked me to assist

21:52.645 --> 21:54.514
with some of his charity work
today. He'll help us out.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.682
Do you know
where to find him?

21:55.715 --> 21:57.384
Everyone knows
where to find him.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.551
You'll just
never get to see him.

21:58.585 --> 21:59.886
Why?

21:59.919 --> 22:01.854
I'm sorry,
Mr. Dodd is unavailable.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.756
I can't deal with you
anymore today.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.859
She doesn't look familiar to you?
Nope.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.428
Please depart the premises,

22:08.461 --> 22:09.529
or I'll have to call security.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.797
Well, go for it.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.632
Because we're not leaving
until we talk

22:12.665 --> 22:14.401
to Sylvester.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.568
RAY:
I'm not leaving

22:15.602 --> 22:17.737
till I get to level four.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.905
Sir, I need you
and your friend

22:18.938 --> 22:20.673
to vacate the premises.

22:20.707 --> 22:21.608
I know you.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.576
You're Sly's wizard pal

22:23.610 --> 22:25.144
who still lives with his mother.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.079
One, you need to go now.

22:27.113 --> 22:30.016
Two, who I live with
is my concern.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.686
Let's go.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.655
WALTER:
Sly's coding problem.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.625
Games, they all have a glitch.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.092
Let's go.
Tell him...

22:40.126 --> 22:41.694
tell him I can fix his glitches.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.463
Sly! Sly?

22:43.496 --> 22:44.931
DYFROST: That's enough. Keep moving.
I can fix your glitches!

22:44.964 --> 22:46.332
(phone rings)
Sly, I can fix your glitches!

22:46.365 --> 22:48.735
Yes, Mr. Dodd? Right away, sir. Sly!
Sly, I can fix your glitches!

22:48.768 --> 22:49.636
Stop!

22:52.004 --> 22:53.740
Mr. Dodd will see them now.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.575
Can I get you a bottle of water?

22:55.608 --> 22:57.677
SYLVESTER: Look, the pad
has sweet indoor/outdoor flow,

22:57.710 --> 22:59.412
but, bro.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.047
We're only talking 6 baths.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.583
No, no, no, no, no, bro.
Nice digs.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.852
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'll spend $150 million,

23:05.885 --> 23:07.687
not a penny more.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.689
I can't believe it.
Sly's become a jackass.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.190
Holler at me when it's done.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.725
(clears throat) Sorry, bros.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.694
Keep trying to buy
a sick new crib,

23:14.727 --> 23:16.195
but they keep upping the price

23:16.228 --> 23:18.465
since Criss Angel
used to own it.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.467
Sylvester, we
need your help.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.668
Hold on.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.436
Names, broseph?

23:23.470 --> 23:24.704
Walter O'Brien.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.739
Uh, there has
been an accident.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.908
We'll get to that.
What I want to know is...

23:28.941 --> 23:31.077
why'd you say that all my games
have a glitch?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.545
What's up with that?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.113
He seems to know
a lot about me, too.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.548
Are you The Happy Mechanic?

23:35.582 --> 23:36.749
I listened to you

23:36.783 --> 23:37.917
after I bought my Maybach.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.886
Great. Another L.A. tool

23:39.919 --> 23:42.188
driving a quarter-million
dollar car

23:42.221 --> 23:44.123
down Sunset
at 20 miles per hour.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.092
My chauffeur
doesn't seem to mind.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.226
WALTER: Sylvester,
it doesn't matter

23:47.259 --> 23:48.828
how I know about
your glitch.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.129
I know you.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.731
You're a perfectionist,

23:51.764 --> 23:53.566
so you wake up every morning

23:53.600 --> 23:54.934
sick to your stomach

23:54.967 --> 23:56.736
that you built this whole place

23:56.769 --> 23:58.037
on the back of a mistake.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.639
(whispers): A mistake
that only you know about.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.207
But for a man
who loves numbers

24:01.240 --> 24:02.642
because of the
certainty it gives

24:02.675 --> 24:03.810
in an uncertain world,

24:03.843 --> 24:06.479
a small error,
e-even one that causes

24:06.513 --> 24:08.581
only the skip of
1/1,000 of a frame,

24:08.615 --> 24:09.816
is a cause of shame.

24:09.849 --> 24:13.786
You just rocked my world,
Broklahoma.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.722
Now, this is a fix

24:15.755 --> 24:17.123
for your code.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.825
And let me tell
you something.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.060
Your refusal to let go

24:21.093 --> 24:23.663
of the wonderment of childhood,

24:23.696 --> 24:26.699
how you look at the-the
world with open eyes?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.535
Your innocence
is your brilliance.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.703
Anybody that tries to tell you
any different is dead wrong.

24:36.643 --> 24:37.910
Holy smokes.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.846
I could really use your help.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.549
I'll give you anything you need.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.717
Cabe, we're on our way.

24:44.751 --> 24:45.818
Get the lead out, Mr. O'Brien.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.854
This situation's going sideways.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.624
These canisters
can't hold the truck anymore.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.759
It's collapsing on the car.

24:52.792 --> 24:53.993
SYLVESTER:
The car is pitching

24:54.026 --> 24:55.795
5/8 of an inch
too far back.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.263
Chief, get him
to engage the e-brake.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.766
That'll move the car forward
a bit, buy us some time.

24:59.799 --> 25:00.633
Kid!

25:00.667 --> 25:02.301
You got to engage
the emergency brake.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.671
It'll allow the car to move
forward an inch and a half.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.873
Oh, I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.074
Keep it together, kid.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.542
It's not gonna happen.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.243
I can't. I can't. My...

25:11.277 --> 25:14.781
My heart, it's beating so fast.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.884
His heart's beating too fast.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.287
Is it over?
TOBY: Yeah.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.689
Fluid's exiting the hole,

25:22.722 --> 25:23.790
pressure's going down.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.692
His heart rate
should return to normal.

25:25.725 --> 25:26.993
Sleeping Beauty's back with us.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.327
Is he gonna be okay?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.528
Not if his heart rate
doesn't go down.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.564
FLORENCE: I thought the point
of Swiss-cheesing his head

25:31.598 --> 25:32.431
was to stabilize him.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.166
Crap! The pressure
at his brain stem

25:34.200 --> 25:35.267
isn't reducing fast enough.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.269
Uh, Sly,
keep track of his pulse.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.606
Look, I'm gonna need you
to do some math

25:39.639 --> 25:40.573
while I stimulate
his vagus nerve

25:40.607 --> 25:42.174
to lower his cardiac rate.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.342
160 BPM.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.844
That's way too fast. We need 80.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.046
Um, how about now?

25:47.079 --> 25:50.116
130. That's 37.5% of
the needed reduction.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.151
You need to increase the
circular motion of your finger

25:52.184 --> 25:54.987
by 266.67%.
How do I do that?

25:55.021 --> 25:56.288
Go faster, dummy.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.260
(gasping) CABE: Kid's
breathing heavy.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.995
He's having a panic attack.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.631
I can't get him to calm down.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.732
If I can't get him to calm down,

26:05.765 --> 26:07.867
I can't get him to focus
to pull the emergency brake.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.268
He's gonna die.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.604
And then I die. Don't ask.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.372
Okay, need to get
his heart rate down.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.608
Ah! I know
who can calm him down.

26:15.642 --> 26:16.909
We need to get to Toby Curtis.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.711
The self-help huckster?
He's a fraud.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.147
From my understanding he's my
future husband, so take it easy.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.650
Okay, uh, Sly, talk
to the police chief.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.752
He'll get you to
the crash site.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.787
Happy and I will
go find Toby.

26:27.820 --> 26:28.988
His ad said he's playing

26:29.021 --> 26:30.857
at the San Dimas Civic Center.
I'll drive.

26:30.890 --> 26:31.924
Great. The 10 should be clear

26:31.958 --> 26:32.825
this time of day.
The 10?

26:32.859 --> 26:34.661
It got crushed
when that British satellite

26:34.694 --> 26:36.629
hit it with a laser. Duh.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.364
Satellite laser?
Scorpion prevented that.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.599
Not here, you didn't.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.336
Synergy.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.105
Mobility.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.841
Tranquility.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.843
My father

26:50.877 --> 26:52.311
was a gambler.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.113
He was always broke.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.016
But in between dodging bookies
and loan sharks,

26:57.049 --> 27:00.252
he would take me
to the high school near us

27:00.286 --> 27:01.888
in Coney Island.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.123
There's no betting lines
on high school games.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.426
Just a father and a son
watching baseball.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.296
Okay, he's kind of cute.
Shh.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.398
Mr. Curtis is rehearsing.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.801
Of course.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.436
When they tore down
that high school,

27:17.469 --> 27:22.441
I made sure
I got seats 23 and 24.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.376
They were our seats.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.312
That is my happy place,

27:26.345 --> 27:28.948
but we don't always need
a physical reminder.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.384
We all have
the power to create

27:32.418 --> 27:35.154
our happy places in our minds.
RAY: I get it.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.190
The chairs are a metaphor
for baseball.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.059
I'm sorry, you all need to go.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.995
We need to talk to Dr. Curtis.
Absolutely not.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.430
Excusez-moi.

27:44.463 --> 27:47.433
Why are you interrupting
my rehearsal?

27:47.466 --> 27:50.803
Because we need
the world's smartest behaviorist

27:50.837 --> 27:52.238
to save a life.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.140
First off,
your assessment of me?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.709
Absolutely correct. Second...

27:56.743 --> 27:58.177
I save lives every day
with my wisdom.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.746
But that wisdom costs a ticket.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.280
I don't see you holding one.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.481
Hey, putz.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.150
We've got a guy in a
car wreck who's dead

28:04.183 --> 28:06.152
if you don't calm him down.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.721
Wow, you're beautiful.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.092
What is your name?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.263
Happy.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.399
WALTER:
But she's not just Happy.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.533
She's your happy place.

28:21.567 --> 28:24.270
Something that you're in...
you're in desperate need of.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.038
Are you kidding me, pal?

28:26.072 --> 28:27.907
Look, I got millions
in the bank,

28:27.940 --> 28:29.742
five best sellers,
and my own plane.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.777
So...
Yeah, yeah.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.812
You finally got the world
to see how brilliant

28:32.845 --> 28:34.513
the Harvard-trained
psychiatrist is,

28:34.546 --> 28:37.216
but, deep down,
you're miserable.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.786
No, I'm not. I-I got my chairs.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.788
Oh, yeah, yeah. Two chairs.

28:41.821 --> 28:42.488
Only one butt.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.857
But here...

28:44.891 --> 28:46.492
here is your seat filler.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.327
TOBY:
I'd really like

28:48.360 --> 28:50.196
to go to dinner with you
if possible.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.364
I'd grab a meal with you.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.133
WALTER: If you want to spend
the rest of your life

28:54.166 --> 28:55.768
sitting next to
her, then please,

28:55.802 --> 28:57.369
Toby.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.005
Please help us.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.208
I'll help.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.943
(tires screech)

29:03.976 --> 29:05.077
TOBY:
I'm gonna talk

29:05.111 --> 29:07.379
to the guy in the car,
you guys figure out how to undo

29:07.413 --> 29:09.281
this jigsaw puzzle.
I was thinking of some ideas

29:09.315 --> 29:10.449
on the way here.
Everyone listen up.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.118
SYLVESTER:
As long as your idea

29:12.151 --> 29:14.120
is to shift the passenger door
open to a 45 degree angle,

29:14.153 --> 29:15.855
then I'm all ears.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.790
Will you let me talk before you
start throwing out theories?

29:17.824 --> 29:18.891
Which are wrong, by the way.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.526
Anything more than 41 degrees,

29:20.559 --> 29:21.560
and we have a human pancake.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.761
Hey, how about we avoid

29:22.795 --> 29:25.531
"human pancake" while I'm trying
to calm the accident victim.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.833
That's what I said
to her earlier.

29:26.866 --> 29:27.699
It's part of my charm.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.036
Are you sure this
is my happy place?

29:30.069 --> 29:31.237
Guys, can we please
work together?

29:31.270 --> 29:32.138
(creaking)

29:32.171 --> 29:33.405
CAR WALTER:
Please, help me, help me!

29:33.439 --> 29:34.306
Please, help me!

29:34.340 --> 29:36.208
You know, this guy
looks just like you.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.177
Who the hell is in charge here?

29:38.210 --> 29:40.913
I am. Now, if you would please
just let me do my thing...

29:40.947 --> 29:42.849
No. I'm in charge.
Now, Toby,

29:42.882 --> 29:43.950
can you calm him down?
Sly,

29:43.983 --> 29:46.152
make the calculations,
and Happy, effectuate a solution

29:46.185 --> 29:47.887
using Sly's conclusions.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.256
Who made you the boss,
Barack Bro'bama?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.357
I made me boss.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.860
I am your boss.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.494
I've been boss.
Now please, just listen to me.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.529
Whatever. Open the door
at the angle that I say.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.398
SYLVESTER:
45 degrees.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.500
41, or I'll cram those stupid
glasses up your gaming console.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.535
You know, when they get like
this, there's only one person

30:03.569 --> 30:05.271
who can get them
to work together.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.839
You're right. I need Paige.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.249
All right, well, this is no
Kovelsky's, but it's all right.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.550
Is that where you were
planning on taking me?

30:18.584 --> 30:20.319
A greasy spoon?

30:20.352 --> 30:22.488
Don't sweat it, pork pie.
We'll make it work.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.023
Yeah, something
tells me we will.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.257
Get a room.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.026
(bell dings)
Order up.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.227
Uh, excuse me.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.196
Hi, uh-- oh, here we go.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.363
Hi, Patty.

30:31.397 --> 30:32.264
Patricia, actually.

30:32.298 --> 30:33.399
Go by "Trish."

30:33.432 --> 30:35.101
Trish. Okay, listen,

30:35.134 --> 30:37.203
I need information. There's
a waitress here, Paige Dineen.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.370
When's her shift start?

30:38.404 --> 30:40.406
Waitress?
She owns the place.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.009
Mr. Elia.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.343
You're here.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.644
Wish I wasn't.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.379
This thing's ancient.
Do I know you?

30:47.413 --> 30:49.281
I set your router up
in Pacoima?

30:49.315 --> 30:50.216
No. But we've
discussed at length

30:50.249 --> 30:52.451
your idea for a hybrid
solid-state drive

30:52.484 --> 30:54.186
incorporating
crystal laser optics.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.223
Crystal laser optics.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.624
That could work.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.627
I'll jot some notes down
on that.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.529
Tell Paige I had to run.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.164
Of course.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.333
Hey, where's the tech guy going?
He hasn't finished.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.936
Paige?
Can I help you?

31:09.969 --> 31:11.203
Yeah. In fact,
you're the only one who can.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.005
Ralph, no mess, please.

31:13.039 --> 31:13.539
Hey, buddy.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.342
How are you...?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.376
PAIGE:
Um, excuse me.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.510
Do you know my son?

31:18.544 --> 31:20.379
Uh, listen, I could waste
my time telling you about how,

31:20.412 --> 31:22.281
in another life, I know him,
and I know you, and that

31:22.314 --> 31:24.483
you've helped me out more than
anybody in the world, but...

31:24.516 --> 31:26.518
you wouldn't believe it, so
saying so would be inefficient.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.354
But all I can tell you
is that my team

31:28.387 --> 31:29.655
and I,
we need your help,

31:29.688 --> 31:31.390
and we know
that you'll come through

31:31.423 --> 31:34.393
because of your heart,
and your kindness,

31:34.426 --> 31:35.928
and your decency.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.233
I know it sounds cray.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.701
Ralph.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.103
Get Fernando
from the kitchen,

31:44.136 --> 31:45.071
tell him to bring
the big knife.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.472
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't need Fernando

31:46.505 --> 31:48.374
and his big knife,
we're not insane.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.508
We just need you.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.543
Look, pal, I didn't get to own
a chain of restaurants

31:51.577 --> 31:53.379
by listening to every goofball
who propositions me.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.481
So get out of here
before I call the cops.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.183
The real cops.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.018
WALTER:
Okay, okay.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.486
You can toss
me out, but...

32:02.221 --> 32:04.456
...you'll be hurting your son.

32:04.490 --> 32:05.491
Because I know

32:05.524 --> 32:07.459
how every night,
you pray

32:07.493 --> 32:09.962
that he'll find someone
that's like him,

32:09.996 --> 32:11.630
someone who can
mentor his gifts,

32:11.663 --> 32:14.500
someone who'll make him feel
like he belongs.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.302
I am that person.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.405
So please, before you ask me
how I know, can I...

32:19.438 --> 32:21.273
can I prove to you
that I'm not nuts?

32:21.307 --> 32:23.009
Hey, buddy.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.286
(sniffs)

32:38.557 --> 32:40.326
Checkmate.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.396
See, he's not
making a mess.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.531
He's just waiting for someone
who understands him

32:45.564 --> 32:47.033
to play with.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.536
What kind of help do you need?

32:53.439 --> 32:55.474
CABE: I got LAPD
to block the roads

32:55.507 --> 32:56.608
from here to County--
he'll get to

32:56.642 --> 32:58.544
the hospital in half the time.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.313
Dear Lord.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.514
Not good, Cabe.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.283
Really, really not good.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.487
Okay, get him to edge his car
a little bit further.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.123
Toby, talk him through
releasing the parking brake.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.192
Wow. Back five seconds,
you're already

33:13.225 --> 33:14.460
just bossing me around, huh?

33:14.493 --> 33:15.761
CABE:
That crap again?

33:15.794 --> 33:17.163
Let's get the job done.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.231
I already did my job.
I did the calculations.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.300
I should be
snowboarding by now.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.069
These guys are animals.
That's why I need you.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.204
When you told Ralph to stop
making a mess, he listened

33:25.237 --> 33:27.173
to you instantly. You know
how to control genius minds.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.041
That's your gift, and
there's someone in that car

33:29.075 --> 33:31.243
who I cannot let die.
TOBY: Stick with me.

33:31.277 --> 33:32.478
You're gonna be fine.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.712
Just take a deep breath.

33:33.745 --> 33:34.746
There you go.

33:35.747 --> 33:36.715
I'm not even gonna ask.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.450
Please.
We need to save him.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.652
Okay, dorks, listen up.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.155
You want to have a
brain-measuring contest,

33:43.189 --> 33:45.224
now is not the time.
Each of you has abilities

33:45.257 --> 33:46.525
the others don't have,
so you all get to

33:46.558 --> 33:48.627
be the best, but only
if you save this guy.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.329
He dies, then you are
just as useless

33:50.362 --> 33:52.098
as any other 100-IQ
human out there.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.199
You gonna let
that happen?

33:53.232 --> 33:54.266
You gonna be ordinary?

33:54.300 --> 33:55.167
No way.
Hell no.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.768
I don't know how to
spell "ordinary."

33:56.802 --> 33:58.070
I mean, I mean,
I do--

33:58.104 --> 33:59.271
it's not a hard word, I just...

33:59.305 --> 34:00.539
Get to work.
Yeah.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.408
Hey, can you
do me a favor?

34:02.441 --> 34:04.643
Just pull on that parking
brake. Can you do that?

34:04.676 --> 34:06.512
You're masterful. There you
go, buddy, there you go.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.846
Thank you.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.415
(echoes):
Oh, my God, Walter!

34:10.382 --> 34:11.817
Why isn't the ambulance
here yet?

34:11.850 --> 34:13.552
Because we live in L.A.
It's been 12 minutes,

34:13.585 --> 34:14.620
they'll be here any second.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.522
(gasping softly)

34:20.292 --> 34:22.661
Ah, damn.
It's a pulmonary edema.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.497
His erratic breathing is causing
his lungs to fill with fluid.

34:25.531 --> 34:26.665
This is a problem.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.667
Guys, we got a problem.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.136
What is that stuff?

34:30.169 --> 34:31.570
Help, it's filling the car!

34:31.603 --> 34:33.105
HAPPY: It wasn't
there a second ago,

34:33.139 --> 34:34.273
and now the car's
half-filled.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.374
What the hell's going on, pal?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.543
ALL:
Things change around here.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.578
Listen, whatever I say,
you're thinking.

34:39.611 --> 34:42.448
Just to be safe, you are pretty
close to suffocating in there.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.783
You better do something.
Fast.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.524
Can't we just smash the windows
and let it all pour out?

34:52.558 --> 34:53.625
Any dramatic shift in weight,

34:53.659 --> 34:54.793
and the truck
crushes him to death.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.262
I know what
that purple stuff is--

34:56.295 --> 34:57.663
it's homemade ballistic gel.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.298
My girlfriend and I,
at the time,

34:59.331 --> 35:00.299
were trapped in a box of it.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.301
Kinky.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.136
How'd you get out?
Blew ourselves up.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.137
We need to blow up the car.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.838
Won't that kill you?
Um, him?

35:06.872 --> 35:08.307
Whatever.
The non-Newtonian fluid

35:08.340 --> 35:09.308
will shield him from impact

35:09.341 --> 35:10.476
while the frame of the car

35:10.509 --> 35:12.244
gets blown out. Plus, I...

35:12.278 --> 35:14.213
I trust you guys.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.184
I need you guys.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.622
Explosion's too big,
the doppelganger you

35:23.655 --> 35:24.723
gets blown to bits.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.625
It's too small, he drowns.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.327
So we need perfect calculations.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.695
I'm on it.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.164
Where do we find
a bomb, nutjob?

35:32.198 --> 35:34.300
You're gonna make it.
Siphon some gas from our car

35:34.333 --> 35:37.169
and then grab a jar
and some wires from, uh,

35:37.203 --> 35:38.270
from that Dumpster
over there.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.738
And then build a timer
from a watch.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.839
Done and done.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.274
Well, we got one hiccup.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.141
For this to work,
we need his head

35:43.175 --> 35:45.344
submerged in the gel
to absorb the blast.

35:45.377 --> 35:46.745
He's already a nervous wreck.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.514
You can talk him through it.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.349
Copy that.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.817
Hey, pal.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.352
You're gonna
have to trust us.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.920
Let that stuff overtake you

35:54.953 --> 35:56.688
and then just hold your
breath for a few seconds.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.490
No, no, no, I can't. I can't.

35:58.524 --> 36:01.227
Like hell you can't 'cause you
want to get out of there, right?

36:01.260 --> 36:03.195
You want to get out of
there so you can get home

36:03.229 --> 36:04.830
and mingle with Kris Kringle.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.398
You and your family
and friends--

36:06.432 --> 36:07.566
spending Christmas
with loved ones,

36:07.599 --> 36:08.767
that's all that
matters, right?

36:11.470 --> 36:14.373
That's right.
That's right.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.208
Bomb's done, ready to rumble.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.443
Okay, hit it, hit it.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.547
Ten seconds!

36:23.382 --> 36:24.783
Ray!

36:24.816 --> 36:25.851
Get out of there!

36:25.884 --> 36:27.786
I'm not real, man.
Don't injure.

36:27.819 --> 36:28.887
Move your ass!

36:28.920 --> 36:31.723
HAPPY:
Three... two...

36:31.757 --> 36:33.659
one!

36:38.430 --> 36:40.232
Thought you were a
mechanical genius?

36:40.266 --> 36:41.099
Ah, don't worry,

36:41.132 --> 36:42.501
this happens on every
adventure we have.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.676
Oh, crap, it's still happening.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.611
It's not the hello
I was looking for.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.314
Guys, guys, he's awake!

36:55.347 --> 36:56.915
Oh, hey.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.017
How do you feel?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.752
My head hurts.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.589
Makes sense, you did take
a half gainer down the stairs.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.257
And a drill bit
into your skull.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.025
CABE: Yeah, but you
still got through it.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.527
Way to be tough.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.529
You guys can see him?

37:10.562 --> 37:11.863
How can you miss him
with that shirt?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.565
I'm so confused.

37:13.599 --> 37:14.400
SYLVESTER: When the
ambulance pulled up,

37:14.433 --> 37:16.368
Ray was hanging out
in the alley.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.703
RALPH: He didn't have
anywhere to stay for Christmas.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.938
I had a lot of options.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.540
Garage was just
the only one that had food.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.774
I was alone when I fell.

37:22.808 --> 37:23.975
CABE: Flo came
in to give you

37:24.009 --> 37:26.545
some peppermint bark, she found
you, called 911 and then us.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.646
She saved your life.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.349
I had the strangest dream.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.617
You all helped save me.

37:31.650 --> 37:32.618
PAIGE:
Scorpion to the rescue

37:32.651 --> 37:33.819
again, huh?
WALTER: No.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.354
No, we weren't Scorpion.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.022
Cabe was chief of police
at the LAPD.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.089
Sweet.

37:38.123 --> 37:42.027
And Happy hosted a-a podcast
on rare sports cars.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.094
HAPPY:
Nice.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.897
WALTER: And, Sly, you-you
were a video game mogul.

37:45.931 --> 37:50.402
Toby, you were a-a famous
motivational speaker.

37:50.436 --> 37:53.739
And, Paige, you-you, uh,
owned a-a restaurant empire.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.743
I'm so sorry I told you all

37:57.776 --> 37:59.611
that I didn't,
I didn't need you.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.079
Well, the truth is,

38:01.112 --> 38:04.550
my subconscious knows that
the opposite is true.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.751
You'd...

38:06.752 --> 38:08.454
...you'd do better without me.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.922
TOBY:
Answer this, 197.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.824
Did we all know each other
in your dream?

38:12.858 --> 38:16.395
Hmm... Happy was lonely;

38:16.428 --> 38:18.464
you were hanging onto an
old memory for happiness,

38:18.497 --> 38:19.465
and, Sly, you were,

38:19.498 --> 38:21.567
you were living in shame.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.903
By the way, I have
the-the fix for your game.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.474
And, Cabe, you were

38:28.507 --> 38:30.942
grumpy and you didn't have
any friends at work.

38:30.976 --> 38:35.013
TOBY: But you said that
we all saved your life.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.882
Deep down, your psyche knows
that we're better together.

38:36.915 --> 38:40.085
You know that you need us,
but you also know

38:40.118 --> 38:43.855
that we need each other,
that we need you, Walter.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.724
We were successful
in your dream

38:45.757 --> 38:47.359
because you think highly of us.

38:50.929 --> 38:51.897
(knock on door)

38:51.930 --> 38:54.032
Hey, the food's here.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.401
Give me a hand.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.374
(whispering):
Toby, come here.

39:02.408 --> 39:05.844
Get her a day
at the San Dimas Raceway.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.979
That's brilliant.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.684
(whispering):
Happy.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.461
Get him two baseball seats from
his high school in Coney Island.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.730
Yes.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.500
Crazy dream, huh?

39:28.534 --> 39:30.402
Anything else
happen in it?

39:30.436 --> 39:31.937
FLORENCE:
Hey, hi.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.406
Is the patient able
to see one more visitor?

39:34.440 --> 39:35.541
CABE:
There she is.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.175
The gal of the hour.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.410
All right!

39:38.444 --> 39:40.412
(all cheering, whooping)

39:41.847 --> 39:44.950
I got a new tin
of peppermint bark

39:44.983 --> 39:49.120
'cause I dropped mine when
I was, um, when I was startled.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.827
Hello, Walter.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.497
Hi.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.036
Hello, Florence.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.105
Thank you.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.079
So, tell me more
about this dream.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.748
Oh.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.450
There's nothing to tell.

40:18.484 --> 40:22.688
The best part was
getting to meet you...

40:22.721 --> 40:27.459
for the very first time
all over again.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.763
Merry Christmas, Paige.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.499
Merry Christmas.
