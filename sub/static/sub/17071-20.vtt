WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.937
MAN: Tiger Woods continued
 to overshadow the competition.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.340
With his chip shot
 at the 8th hole.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.411
[ cheers and applause ]
The Masters. Nice.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.081
Tiger Woods is dominating
the field like a boss.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.882
He's the freaking best.

00:14.982 --> 00:15.916
Wow.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.351
He'll be the youngest player
to ever win.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.786
Exactly.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.621
Which is why
we can't let Mom find out.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.290
What are you
talking about?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.358
Tiger Woods
is half-Asian.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.626
What?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.095
He is?

00:27.195 --> 00:28.462
I've never
heard that before.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.764
Yeah. Nobody talks about it
for some reason.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.933
Wait, but why can't
we let Mom find out?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.435
"Why can't we" --

00:34.535 --> 00:37.238
This guy wants to know

00:37.338 --> 00:38.439
why we can't let
Mom find out.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.473
Psh.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.474
You know how Mom gets

00:41.509 --> 00:42.710
when she sees an Asian person
succeed publicly.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.545
Remember Kristi Yamaguchi?

00:44.645 --> 00:45.879
Or Michael Chang?

00:45.979 --> 00:47.047
Or Connie Chung?

00:49.217 --> 00:51.619
Tensions were high today

00:51.719 --> 00:56.224
in Bos-nie-ah
Herz-egg-gov-ven-govenah.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.425
JESSICA: Again.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.127
By the time
I could pronounce it,

00:59.227 --> 01:00.128
the war was over.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.295
Mom can't find out.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.930
We have to keep this
from her.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.599
Agreed.
 Nobody talks.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.268
I'm going over to Honey's.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.836
Tiger Woods is half-Asian.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.404
He's about to win
the Masters.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.972
What's this, now?

01:12.072 --> 01:16.310
One of our own succeeding
in the public eye?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.246
If you start
punching yourself now,

01:18.346 --> 01:20.414
it'll be easier for you
when Mom leaves.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.416
I'll take that
into consideration.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.588
* Fresh off the boat

01:27.688 --> 01:29.257
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:29.357 --> 01:31.525
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:31.625 --> 01:32.826
* Fresh off the boat

01:32.926 --> 01:35.163
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:35.263 --> 01:36.630
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:36.730 --> 01:39.367
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:39.467 --> 01:41.435
MAN: Tensions were high
 as Tiger lined up

01:41.535 --> 01:44.172
this historic final shot
 of the Masters.

01:45.539 --> 01:49.143
[ cheers and applause ]

01:49.243 --> 01:50.844
Those are
Tiger's parents.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.613
Tiger embraced
 his dad, Earl,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.348
who he credits
 as instrumental

01:54.448 --> 01:56.617
in his quest
 to become a champion.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.619
Imagine how proud
his parents must be.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.820
I know.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.654
You know, in a way,

02:01.622 --> 02:02.523
I feel like I could have
raised Tiger Woods.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.058
Mm. Because you see yourself
in his Asian mother.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.059
No.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.561
I see myself in Earl.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.396
He drove his son hard,

02:09.497 --> 02:11.465
and now
Tiger is a champion.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.866
That's good parenting.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.835
Yeah,
I see myself in him too.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.070
Yeah, well...

02:17.171 --> 02:19.573
Earl is a disciplinarian
like me.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.175
He pushed Tiger
to greatness

02:21.275 --> 02:23.177
the way I push our boys
to be the best.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.246
If anything,
you're more like Kultida.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.014
Who?

02:27.114 --> 02:28.148
Exactly.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.883
Tiger's mother.
The forgotten one.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.152
(sighs)

02:32.253 --> 02:33.721
Oh, no.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.056
Now you want to talk about
what I just said.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.492
No.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.229
**

02:41.329 --> 02:42.996
Hey, so,
speaking of dishes,

02:43.096 --> 02:44.832
when you say
I'm like Kultida,

02:44.932 --> 02:47.067
what exactly do you mean?
(scoffs] I knew it.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.603
Well, it's just
we both do our part
to parent the boys.

02:49.703 --> 02:50.704
Of course we do.

02:50.804 --> 02:51.772
All I'm saying is

02:51.872 --> 02:54.074
that in the same way
Earl and I share

02:54.174 --> 02:56.577
a strict and tough
parenting philosophy,

02:56.677 --> 03:00.781
you and Kultida
are more relaxed and lenient

03:00.881 --> 03:02.049
and soft.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.352
Well, I wouldn't say "soft."
But it's true.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.053
Maybe I'm
a little more permissive.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.888
Right. You're Kultida.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.458
She's got her big hat
and sunglasses.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.693
She's hanging back,
passive,

03:12.793 --> 03:15.296
quietly watching
Earl run the show.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.864
You know
I can't pull of hats.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.366
They make my face
look small.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.301
I'm more lenient than you
because I choose to be.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.235
My dad was a tough man,

03:21.335 --> 03:22.803
and I promised myself
when I had kids,

03:22.903 --> 03:23.804
I'd be different.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.139
That's wonderful.
I can really see that.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.375
All I mean is that

03:27.475 --> 03:29.243
Earl and I do
a lot of the heavy lifting

03:29.343 --> 03:30.811
to push our children
to succeed.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.413
And sometimes,
kids don't need that.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.315
Sometimes, they need
their parents to step back

03:34.415 --> 03:36.317
so they can find their
own interests and talents,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.419
because that's also
important for success.
Mm.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.821
That's certainly
a very Kultida way of thinking.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.155
Just because
I parent differently

03:42.256 --> 03:43.257
doesn't mean
it's worse.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.458
I'm not saying it is.
Really?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.460
Because it feels like
what you're saying

03:46.560 --> 03:47.495
is that, as a parent,

03:47.595 --> 03:49.730
you're hands on, effective,
doing everything,

03:49.830 --> 03:51.332
and I'm hands off,
in the background,

03:51.432 --> 03:52.766
doing nothing
but wearing a hat.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.234
I wouldn't say
you do nothing,

03:54.335 --> 03:56.136
but that is a very good summary,
Louis.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.805
Well put.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.106
Goodnight.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.643
**

04:02.743 --> 04:04.111
(bell dings)

04:04.211 --> 04:06.580
REBA: Good morning,
 Abe Lincoln Middle Schoolers.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.749
It's Reba
 with your daily announcements.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.183
The new beams
 are up in the library.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.019
And you may have noticed
 the molding is in place.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.488
Just waiting on the guys
to paint the trim.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.956
That'll happen Thursday.

04:16.055 --> 04:19.192
Also,
 lunch today is burger bar.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.428
BILL:
What are you talking about?

04:20.528 --> 04:22.596
Look, man, we can't have
the same backpack.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.131
But this is my backpack.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.999
Fool, did you hear me?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.168
Get a new b.p.
or we fight.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.173
Tiger Woods?
That guy's dope.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.175
He hit the green from the tee
on a par 4.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.044
I bet he gets
 so many girls.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.679
I love everything
about Tiger.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.881
Especially that he's
an African-American dude

04:40.981 --> 04:42.716
dominating a sport
full of white guys.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.385
Tiger's
also half-Asian.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.219
What?
No, he's not.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.220
It's true.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.656
His mom is Thai.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.658
That's the brim of her sun hat
in background.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.360
None of us
have ever heard that.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.127
And we know
everything about him.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.629
I've seen
Tiger's dad, Earl,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.297
and he's definitely
African-American.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.866
Right.
And his mom is Thai.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.201
Come on!

05:01.301 --> 05:02.803
(bell rings)

05:04.237 --> 05:06.039
He's half-Asian!

05:06.139 --> 05:07.307
Half-Asian?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.142
Are we talking Keanu?

05:12.179 --> 05:13.213
Hey.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.682
I've been thinking about
our conversation.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.049
Oh, boy.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.317
And there's an easy way

05:17.418 --> 05:19.520
to put our different
parenting styles to the test.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.755
Let's make a friendly bet
on the golf course.
No, thank you.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.091
"Friendly" means
"not for money."
I'm listening.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.059
You and I both have about
the same level of golf skill.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.495
Well,
passably competent.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.597
We each take one of the boys
for two weeks

05:29.697 --> 05:30.864
and help them learn golf.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.400
Then the boys
will play nine holes,

05:32.500 --> 05:35.503
and whoever's player wins,
is the parenting champion.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.270
(scoffs)
I'm going to win.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.508
True greatness comes
from the Earl/Jessica
parenting philosophy,

05:40.608 --> 05:42.209
not from
the Kultida/Louis one.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.176
We'll see.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.412
Just two rules.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.380
We both have to use
the same golf instructor

05:46.480 --> 05:47.448
so no one
has the advantage,

05:47.548 --> 05:48.516
and Emery is out.

05:48.616 --> 05:49.783
Oh, of course.
He's good at everything.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.519
It wouldn't be fair.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.454
Well,
that leaves Eddie and Evan.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.955
I'll take Evan.
He's more moldable.

05:55.055 --> 05:55.956
Great.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.258
And I'll take Eddie,
because he's...

05:58.358 --> 06:00.461
well,
he's the only kid left.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.530
**

06:07.568 --> 06:10.070
Well, this is exactly
what we didn't want to happen.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.439
Thanks a lot, Evan.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.873
I was mad at myself too,

06:12.973 --> 06:15.275
but look at these clothes.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.810
They're like
my regular clothes

06:16.910 --> 06:18.145
but with an athletic cut.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.280
This is gonna be great,
right, guys?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.583
We'll work hard,
but we'll also have fun.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.084
(scoffs) Fun?

06:24.184 --> 06:25.385
This isn't a cartoon,
Louis.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.954
We're not mermaids
and reggae crabs

06:27.054 --> 06:28.556
singing
at the bottom of the sea.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.327
**

06:34.428 --> 06:37.831
Evan, this is
your golf instructor, Phil.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.132
His name
is actually Phillip,

06:39.232 --> 06:42.402
but white people
love to shorten their names.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.271
Thank you, Jess.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.642
Evan, this is
your new instructor, Ted.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.278
I chose him because his name
can't be shortened.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.413
I once played a round
with Jimmy Carter.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.748
Hm.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.116
He's gonna
teach you the basics,

06:56.216 --> 06:58.251
and then Mommy's gonna be here
to push him to push you.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.920
Great.
I'm ready to learn.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.021
Okay, Evan.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.189
Take this 5-iron.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.957
And I want you
to hit this ball.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.426
I just want to get a sense
of where you're at.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.001
True beginner.
Got it.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.435
Yes.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.471
Ted, together,
we are going to mold

07:17.571 --> 07:18.939
this beginner lump of clay

07:19.039 --> 07:21.542
into an excellent golfer.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.344
* Yo-yo, yo, yo-yo

07:24.444 --> 07:26.213
* Yo-yo, yo, yo-yo

07:26.313 --> 07:27.848
(rapping)
* When I step up in the place

07:27.948 --> 07:29.483
(alarm beeping)
* A-yo, I step correct

07:29.583 --> 07:31.218
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
* I got you all in check

07:31.318 --> 07:32.686
* I got that head nod,
y'all *

07:32.786 --> 07:34.121
* That make you
break your neck *
Again.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.355
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
Again.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.057
Again.
* I got you all
in check *

07:37.157 --> 07:39.392
* And you know we come through
to wreck the discotheque *

07:39.493 --> 07:41.829
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
* I got you all in check

07:41.929 --> 07:43.330
* Throw your hands
up in the air *

07:43.430 --> 07:44.464
* Don't ever dis--

07:46.500 --> 07:48.902
(sighs)
I'm sorry, Mommy.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.371
The clothes are for me,
but maybe golf isn't.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.707
Nonsense.
You just have to work harder.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.009
Maybe you just need longer tees.
I'll go get them.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.345
Oh, so you can eat a Popsicle
behind the pro shop?

07:58.445 --> 07:59.379
No way.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
I'll get them.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.384
Mm-hmm.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.485
(chuckling)

08:05.586 --> 08:07.888
Louis?
Oh, hey, Jessica.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.157
You know, I think I was
too quick to dismiss hats.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.659
I don't know if my face
got bigger

08:11.759 --> 08:13.360
or the hats got smaller,
but either way,

08:13.460 --> 08:15.696
I'm wearing this bad boy
out of the store.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.831
Okay.
Where's Eddie?

08:17.931 --> 08:20.267
Oh, we've been practicing
his fairway woods all morning,

08:20.367 --> 08:21.234
so I gave him a break.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.502
Oh, a break?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.838
That's very Louis/Kultida.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.607
No breaks for Evan.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.041
(snickers)

08:28.141 --> 08:30.377
I see you've got
the extra-long tees there.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.347
Well,
I suppose to a tiny face,

08:34.447 --> 08:36.216
all tees look extra long.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.919
**

08:40.020 --> 08:41.688
(sighs)

08:42.623 --> 08:46.093
**

08:52.733 --> 08:54.802
Hi, do you have a minute
to talk about Tiger Woods?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.069
Sorry, got to run.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.205
Hey, do you have a minute
to -- no?

08:58.806 --> 08:59.940
Excuse me, can I --

09:00.040 --> 09:02.475
Principal Hunter,
can I talk to you about --

09:02.576 --> 09:04.778
I already donated
at work.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.580
(sighs)
(bell dings)

09:06.680 --> 09:09.416
REBA: Good morning,
 Abe Lincoln Middle Schoolers.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.418
It's Reba
 with the daily announcements.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.821
Library trim is painted...
periwinkle.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.055
Odd choice.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.890
Lunch today
 is pepperoni pizza,

09:16.990 --> 09:18.391
the best kind of pizza.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.994
She's right.
Pepperoni is the best.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.137
Hey, Reba.
REBA: Hi, Emery.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.138
How's Eddie?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.139
Is he still
with that girl --

09:32.239 --> 09:34.074
pretty,
smells like strawberries?

09:34.174 --> 09:35.676
Alison? Yeah.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.611
It's been, like, a year.
They seem good.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.780
Whatever. What's up?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.314
I was wondering
if I could us the P.A. system

09:41.414 --> 09:42.249
to make an announcement.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.483
Everyone is forced
to listen to

09:43.583 --> 09:45.686
your construction
and lunch updates every day.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.788
So it might be a good way
to get my message out.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.489
Forced to listen to me?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.192
People love
my construction updates.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.094
They're important.
Totally.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.128
My thing's important too.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.596
It's about Tiger Woods.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.831
The golfer?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.467
Listen, bud,
you think I just let anyone

10:00.567 --> 10:01.802
say whatever they want
into the P.A.?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.704
If you would just listen to
this Tiger thing --

10:03.804 --> 10:04.838
I'm sorry.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.306
I'd love to help you out,
but I'm swamped.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.374
I just don't have time.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.445
You don't quit, do you?

10:12.545 --> 10:13.513
Fine.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.682
(sighs)
Meet me in the newsroom.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.949
We have a newsroom?

10:16.049 --> 10:17.384
Classroom 2b.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.552
We share it with yearbook.
Ugh.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.688
Bring Eddie.

10:20.788 --> 10:21.789
No, don't.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.991
It's not worth it
if I can't focus on him.

10:25.625 --> 10:31.198
**

10:31.298 --> 10:32.532
Louis, I've been thinking.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.335
I'm worried I have
too big an advantage

10:35.435 --> 10:36.837
in our bet.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.471
How's that?

10:38.571 --> 10:41.008
Well, not only do I have
the more teachable son,

10:41.108 --> 10:44.011
I also have the superior
parenting philosophy,

10:44.111 --> 10:47.881
so I was thinking that,
as a favor to you,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.150
we could swap
Eddie and Evan.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.352
Sure, I'll swap.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.487
I believe in my methods.
I can win with either son.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.423
(chuckles)
I don't think so, Louis.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.991
You just took the dud.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.593
Earl has other kids
who aren't great golfers.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.029
Sometimes, you get a dud.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.997
I love my dud son,
but he can't win.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.999
I think I'll be fine.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.568
Louis/Kultida know
what they're doing, after all.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.603
Evan,
you're golfing with Daddy now.

11:10.704 --> 11:11.772
I'm training Eddie.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.006
It's nothing personal.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.074
I just need to win,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.376
and I think he gives me
the best chance.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.577
I see.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.879
Well,
thank you for everything.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.447
It's been wonderful
working with you.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.882
And I wish you
the best of luck.

11:21.982 --> 11:26.053
I'm gonna pray for seven plagues
to befall your house.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.088
What?
Nothing.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.758
Enjoy your time
with your first-born son.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.928
**

11:35.028 --> 11:37.765
I can't believe you're making me
do this before school.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.933
This is way less fun
than with Dad.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.935
He always
lets me get Cinnabon.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.604
Yes, I noticed the frosting
on the club handles.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.605
Oh, hey, Eddie.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.807
Where's your dad?

11:46.907 --> 11:47.875
No Cinnabon?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.376
I am molding Eddie now.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.114
He's less obedient than Evan,
so we get to be tougher.

11:54.214 --> 11:54.948
**

11:55.048 --> 11:57.484
* Yo-yo, yo, yo-yo

11:57.584 --> 11:59.452
* Yo-yo, yo, yo-yo

11:59.552 --> 12:00.788
(rapping)
* When I step up in the place

12:00.888 --> 12:02.422
(alarm beeping)
* A-yo, I step correct

12:02.522 --> 12:04.758
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
* I got you all in check

12:04.858 --> 12:07.594
* I got that head nod, y'all
that make you break your neck *

12:07.694 --> 12:09.897
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
* I got you all in check

12:09.997 --> 12:12.665
* And you know we come through
to wreck the discotheque *

12:12.766 --> 12:14.467
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
* I got you all in check

12:14.567 --> 12:16.603
(grunts)
* Throw your hands up
in the air *

12:16.703 --> 12:18.071
* Don't ever disrespect

12:18.171 --> 12:20.107
* Whoo-hah, whoo-hah
* I got you all in check

12:20.207 --> 12:23.977
* Busta Rhymes, up in the place,
true, indeed *

12:24.077 --> 12:25.312
* Yes, I catch wreck,
and that's word -- *

12:25.412 --> 12:26.346
(thuds)

12:26.446 --> 12:28.348
He's getting worse.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.817
I can't swing
because my arms are sore

12:29.917 --> 12:31.484
from all those extra weights
you made me lift.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.020
I told you,
you can't follow an arm day

12:33.120 --> 12:34.454
with an arm day.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.458
Welcome back, Phil.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.759
Thank you, Jessica.

12:40.828 --> 12:45.999
**

12:46.099 --> 12:47.634
What's all this?

12:47.734 --> 12:48.836
We went
to putt-putt earlier,

12:48.936 --> 12:49.937
and Evan loved it so much,

12:50.037 --> 12:51.604
he wanted to keep playing
when we got home,

12:51.704 --> 12:52.605
so I set this up.

12:52.705 --> 12:53.673
He's pretty good.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.543
(chuckling)

12:57.710 --> 12:59.046
Remember me?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.049
We hadn't gotten
to putting yet.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.716
We're feeling good
about the showdown tomorrow.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.285
I nicknamed Evan
"The Little Kitchen"

13:05.385 --> 13:06.854
because he always sinks it.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.523
(crow caws)

13:10.623 --> 13:13.126
I don't understand.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.963
Am I the ineffective parent?

13:24.737 --> 13:25.738
Hey.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.541
I brought tissues
to dry your tears,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.243
'cause you're gonna lose.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.879
You're a better parent
than me.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.546
Oh.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.882
You're really upset
about this.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.050
I ruined two kids
in two weeks.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.353
I thought my pushing
brought out the best in them,

13:40.453 --> 13:42.923
but I've been
holding them back.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.825
I've failed
and you've succeeded.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.827
(sighs) Jessica.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.396
Parenting
isn't all or nothing.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.331
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.765
We share equal roles.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.734
The boys are who they are
because of the both of us.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.735
No.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.769
If our bet proves anything,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.271
it's that your parenting
philosophy works

13:58.371 --> 13:59.372
and mine doesn't.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.874
Who cares about the bet?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.609
It was just supposed to be
for fun.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.911
You know what?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.078
The bet is off.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.513
I'd rather we just have
a nice family day

14:06.613 --> 14:07.547
at the club tomorrow.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.781
We'll all play nine holes.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.617
We won't even keep score.
Fine.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.185
But you still win.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.688
There's no winner
in parenting.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.424
But if you see
a gold wrestling belt

14:17.524 --> 14:18.391
in our closet

14:18.491 --> 14:19.893
that says
"Parent-mania Champion,"

14:19.993 --> 14:22.095
just know I had it made
before this conversation.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.863
**

14:23.964 --> 14:25.432
(bell ringing)

14:25.532 --> 14:28.368
Mr. Dekro and Ms. Summers
are having an affair?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.769
This isn't news, Cory.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.472
This is the worst-kept secret
in Orlando.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.107
Find something else.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.077
Hey, Reba.
Thanks for meeting me.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.279
I only need five minutes.
You got two.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.981
So, I recently learned

14:41.081 --> 14:43.083
that Tiger Woods
is part Asian.
No way.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.117
If that was true,

14:44.217 --> 14:45.785
people would be
talking about it.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.388
Well, people aren't.
That's why I have to.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.622
I pulled a few articles

14:49.722 --> 14:51.324
where they
only refer to Tiger as

14:51.424 --> 14:52.825
an African-American
golfer.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.227
Nice file folder.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.296
Mead Five-Star in teal --

14:56.396 --> 14:57.998
solid choice.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.267
Anyway, after Tiger
got his green jacket

15:00.367 --> 15:01.568
for winning the Masters,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.136
even his dad Earl said,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.005
"Green and black
go well together."

15:05.105 --> 15:06.773
No mention
of his Asian half.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.441
It's almost like
him being Asian

15:08.541 --> 15:10.743
makes the story less meaningful
for some reason.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.445
I'm not trying
to take anything away

15:12.545 --> 15:14.114
from Tiger's
African-American side,

15:14.214 --> 15:16.349
but I just want kids to know
about his Asian side.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.251
Tiger's a superstar.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.120
And we should get to
take pride in it too.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.290
(whispering)
It's not opening tomorrow.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.424
It's not opening
tomorrow?

15:24.524 --> 15:25.959
But the reno's completed.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.260
They painted the trim.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.463
Sorry, I need to get into
this library debacle A.S.A.P.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.200
Just take a look
when you can.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.653
Oh, he's good again.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.289
Must be that Cinnabon
you gave him this morning.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.059
Actually,
'bon's wearing off.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.727
I could go for
a little something else.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.296
I saw the clubhouse
had Mexican egg rolls.

16:04.197 --> 16:04.897
Don't ask me.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.366
Whatever your father says.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.867
I have no opinion.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.636
I hate seeing you like this,
Mommy,

16:09.736 --> 16:12.405
but it is a testament
to the power of prayer.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.573
LOUIS: You know what?

16:13.673 --> 16:15.575
I'm excited to try
a Mexican egg roll.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.145
I'll go get us...
one to split four ways?

16:18.245 --> 16:20.413
No, let's just
get a platter.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.215
(laughs)

16:24.384 --> 16:26.053
I don't know
about you guys,

16:26.153 --> 16:28.155
but I can get into
bummed-out Mom.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.093
(sighs)

16:40.667 --> 16:42.169
It can't be.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.942
Kultida Woods?

16:51.344 --> 16:52.512
Do I know you?

16:52.612 --> 16:55.515
No, but I know you.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.617
I can't believe you're here.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.918
It must be fate.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.089
I like to come to this club
when I'm in this area.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.590
Best Cobb salad
in Florida.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.959
Can I ask you something?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.528
Oh, my friend make them.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.196
You cannot buy them.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.633
No, your hat is beautiful,
but it's not about that.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.404
What is the secret
to Earl's success?

17:17.503 --> 17:18.971
What do you mean?

17:19.071 --> 17:20.807
My husband and I
had a bet,

17:20.906 --> 17:23.810
and I pushed my sons
the way Earl pushed Tiger,

17:23.910 --> 17:26.913
but the harder I drove them,
the worse they got.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.482
My husband
took a softer approach,

17:29.582 --> 17:30.883
like you do,

17:30.983 --> 17:33.320
and he was
more effective.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.422
I do not take
soft approach.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.989
A mother
begins her child's life

17:37.090 --> 17:38.958
when she pushes them
into the world,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.228
and she never stops.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.962
Two-minute labors,
all three of them --

17:43.062 --> 17:43.930
that's how hard I push.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.065
They need that
to succeed.
Mm.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.668
Discipline does not always
have immediate result.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.104
Sometime,
it even look like failing,

17:51.204 --> 17:54.341
but it lay
a strong foundation.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.944
Without that,
the house would crumble.

17:58.044 --> 18:01.348
That's how you built
the house of Tiger.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.017
So, how come Earl
gets all the credit?

18:05.118 --> 18:07.654
Some work
is behind the scene.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.022
You cannot
watch your child shine

18:10.123 --> 18:12.692
when the spotlight
is in your eye.

18:12.792 --> 18:17.197
So, I was right about
my parenting style all along.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.798
The only thing
I was wrong about

18:18.898 --> 18:19.932
was being the Earl,

18:20.032 --> 18:23.203
when I am the Kultida.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.140
Thank you.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.509
You're welcome.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.612
**

18:37.617 --> 18:39.386
Hey.
Where's the platter at?

18:39.486 --> 18:40.887
No platter.
Back to hole one.

18:40.987 --> 18:41.988
We're doing it again.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.024
But we just played
nine holes with Dad.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.727
He knows how to have fun
and still helps us be good.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.529
That's true, but you're
also good because of me,

18:49.629 --> 18:51.030
which is why
we're doing it again.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.366
And this time,
we are keeping score,

18:53.466 --> 18:56.203
because life keeps score.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.540
You heard your mom.
Get back out there.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.141
(sighs)

19:03.843 --> 19:06.078
Hey, what happened on your way
to get that platter?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.147
I saw a hat.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.017
So did I.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.090
I actually love this.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.526
You look like
Andy GarcÃ­a.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.494
Oh.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.836
Who was that
you were talking to earlier?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.939
Oh, another lady mistook me
for Kultida Woods.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.875
Happens every time
I come to a golf course.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.344
Moms are all over me.

19:37.444 --> 19:40.747
Oh, Norma, why don't you just
tell them the truth?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.783
Eh. It's easier
just to play along.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.884
And you know?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.586
I think
I really help them.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.357
Earl Woods.
It's fate!

19:51.724 --> 19:53.526
I got to stop coming here.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.635
Reba wants you to meet her
in the AV room, now.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.239
REBA:
I looked at your file.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.707
This is big.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.242
Tiger Woods is half-Asian.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.144
Yes, that's literally
what I've been saying.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.813
I decided to give you
the P.A. mic.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.582
We're gonna blow this thing
wide open.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.150
But listen,
when I hit that button,

20:18.251 --> 20:19.719
they can't un-hear
any of it.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.988
Yeah, okay.
That's the point.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.623
I want them to hear this.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.258
I mean, you're talking about
bringing down

20:25.358 --> 20:26.593
the greatest golfer
in the world.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.228
We're not talking about
bringing him down.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.564
We're just saying
he's half-Asian.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.004
It's time.

20:38.104 --> 20:41.073
**

20:48.781 --> 20:50.917
Good morning,
this is Emery Huang.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.152
And I'd like to talk to you
about Tiger Woods,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.688
a great golfer
we all admire.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.790
We all know about his dad, Earl,

20:57.890 --> 21:00.793
but I want to tell you all
about his mom, Kultida,

21:00.893 --> 21:01.994
who is from Thailand.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.096
Historic.

21:04.196 --> 21:07.867
This is not to take away from
 Tiger's African-American side,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.769
but to paint a complete picture

21:09.869 --> 21:12.271
so all Asian kids out there
 can see themselves in him...

21:12.372 --> 21:15.375
ALL: Fight, fight, fight!
 ...and make his success
 their own.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.377
I told you to get
a new backpack.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.878
This is my backpack!

21:18.978 --> 21:20.780
I got it for my birthday!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.549
(both scream)
(bell dings)

21:22.649 --> 21:25.652
