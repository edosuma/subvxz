WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:02.716
Support for Pawnee Community Radio

00:02.717 --> 00:04.552
comes from listeners like you

00:04.603 --> 00:07.388
and from the new film
<i>The Shadows of Seven Heads,</i>

00:07.439 --> 00:09.690
the dramic tale
of an Israeli soldier

00:09.724 --> 00:12.610
who falls in love with conjoined
Palestinian sextuplets.

00:12.644 --> 00:14.979
Out soon
from Focus Features.

00:15.013 --> 00:17.281
Welcome to
"Thought For Your Thoughts."

00:17.315 --> 00:19.349
I'm your host Derry Murbles,

00:19.367 --> 00:22.019
sitting in for Nina Joplin,

00:22.037 --> 00:24.989
who is touring the country
performing a spoken-word opera

00:25.023 --> 00:27.191
about pear-shaped women.

00:27.425 --> 00:31.561
My guest today
is City Councilwoman

00:31.579 --> 00:32.662
Leslie Knope.

00:33.197 --> 00:34.832
It is a pleasure
to be back, Derry.

00:35.316 --> 00:38.368
Your show last week
on dolphin lactation

00:38.903 --> 00:40.954
was just riveting radio.

00:40.989 --> 00:44.992
Derry, my team and I
are trying to build a park,

00:45.026 --> 00:47.861
and we need input on the design

00:47.879 --> 00:50.664
from you,
the citizens of Pawnee.

00:50.698 --> 00:53.667
So I guess I'm here
to send out the Bat-Signal.

00:53.701 --> 00:56.887
A Bat-Signal, for
listeners who might not know,

00:56.921 --> 01:01.391
refers to the children's
character "the Bat-Man"

01:01.426 --> 01:04.845
a strong gentleman
who fights crime nocturnally.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.647
That's correct.
Well put.

01:06.681 --> 01:10.400
This park is going to be
a celebration of Pawnee

01:10.435 --> 01:13.186
by Pawnee and for Pawnee.

01:13.220 --> 01:15.989
So, you know,
send in your plan

01:16.024 --> 01:18.108
or your resume...
And quick.

01:18.159 --> 01:19.993
Please. Hurry.

01:20.028 --> 01:22.896
This is all gonna fall apart
if you don't hurry.

01:22.914 --> 01:24.448
Coming up after the break,

01:24.482 --> 01:26.500
movie reviews
with Ken Tucker

01:26.534 --> 01:29.119
who is filling in
for David Bianculli

01:29.153 --> 01:31.688
who's in New York
filling in for Ken Tucker.

01:31.723 --> 01:34.875
Leslie, would you like
to introduce the next segment?

01:34.909 --> 01:36.343
Okay.

01:36.377 --> 01:40.347
"Now it's time for
'Jazz Plus Jazz Equals Jazz, '

01:40.381 --> 01:43.083
"today we have a recording
of Benny Goodman

01:43.101 --> 01:46.720
played over a separate
recording of Miles Davis."

01:50.641 --> 01:55.195
Research shows that our
listeners love jazz.

02:17.802 --> 02:20.487
All right,
so this is a letter

02:20.521 --> 02:22.472
from what looks like
a federal penitentiary.

02:22.507 --> 02:23.673
"Here's a model

02:23.725 --> 02:25.291
"of what I thought the park
could look like.

02:25.309 --> 02:28.311
Also, I'm innocent.
Please find me a lawyer."

02:28.346 --> 02:29.913
I'm getting kind of worried.

02:29.947 --> 02:33.433
I mean, we have not received
one usable idea so far.

02:33.467 --> 02:34.818
Hang on.
Look at this guy.

02:34.852 --> 02:37.070
"30 years of experience

02:37.105 --> 02:40.607
"with a degree in architecture
from the Royal Danish Academy

02:40.641 --> 02:42.308
of Fine Arts in Copenhagen."

02:42.326 --> 02:45.112
Wow! Beautiful fountain.

02:45.146 --> 02:47.948
Perfectly manicured shrubbery.

02:47.982 --> 02:49.750
This is like
Parks Department porn.

02:49.784 --> 02:51.451
This guy is great.

02:51.485 --> 02:53.503
I don't care if he's some
junkie war criminal pimp.

02:53.538 --> 02:55.172
I am not gonna
change my mind.

02:55.206 --> 02:57.924
His name's Wreston St. James.
He's from Eagleton.

02:57.959 --> 02:59.042
Oh, I've changed my mind.

02:59.077 --> 03:00.944
I'm not being melodramatic
when I say

03:00.979 --> 03:02.546
that people from Eagleton
are snobby and evil,

03:02.580 --> 03:04.548
and they look down on Pawnee,
and they would most likely

03:04.582 --> 03:05.949
exterminate everyone
who isn't from Eagleton

03:05.984 --> 03:08.585
if they weren't so busy
being obsessed with themselves.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.420
God, that was close.

03:10.455 --> 03:12.156
Sometimes when I rant
about Eagleton,

03:12.190 --> 03:14.057
I forget to breathe,
and I pass out.

03:14.092 --> 03:16.026
No. We cannot have
someone from Eagleton

03:16.060 --> 03:17.561
design a park for Pawnee.

03:17.595 --> 03:20.864
We have had a blood feud
that has lasted for 200 years.

03:20.899 --> 03:22.766
Well, we don't have
a lot of time,

03:22.800 --> 03:24.668
and he is the first
decent candidate.

03:24.702 --> 03:26.870
So let's at least
go meet the guy.

03:26.905 --> 03:28.105
Yeah, that's a good idea.

03:28.139 --> 03:29.706
Then we can reject him
face-to-face.

03:29.741 --> 03:31.775
I like your plan.

03:31.809 --> 03:34.811
Friends, former lovers,

03:34.846 --> 03:36.980
acquaintances, Jerry,

03:37.015 --> 03:39.750
I introduce you
to the future home of...

03:39.784 --> 03:41.251
Rent-A-Swag!

03:41.786 --> 03:42.920
Yikes.

03:42.954 --> 03:45.889
 Much like women in
'90s stand-up comedy routines,

03:45.924 --> 03:47.391
Tommy be shopping.

03:47.425 --> 03:49.926
I started a business where I
rent my fancy clothes to teens

03:49.960 --> 03:51.628
so their parents don't have to
buy them nice things

03:51.662 --> 03:52.629
they'll just grow out of.

03:52.664 --> 03:54.431
So if you see
a 14-year-old kid

03:54.465 --> 03:57.234
wearing a Louis Vuitton cravat,
you know who to thank.

03:57.268 --> 03:58.535
Me.

03:58.570 --> 04:01.171
And Louis Vuitton for making
some dope-ass cravats.

04:01.206 --> 04:03.607
Son, I love wildlife,

04:03.641 --> 04:05.842
but is a store
the best place for it?

04:05.877 --> 04:08.612
- Help.
- The place needs some work,

04:08.646 --> 04:10.514
but this is a great location.

04:10.548 --> 04:13.150
Lots of foot traffic,
no metered parking.

04:13.184 --> 04:15.152
And it's well within
my fiscal range.

04:15.186 --> 04:17.254
Good use of the word fiscal,
Tommy-- very upscale.

04:17.288 --> 04:19.923
Very impressive.
Watching you gives me faith

04:19.958 --> 04:21.959
that <i>anyone</i> can reinvent
themselves.

04:21.993 --> 04:23.543
Tommy Timberlake is dead.

04:23.595 --> 04:27.180
Long live Thomas M. Haverford,
responsible tycoon.

04:27.215 --> 04:30.300
Help.
I can't move.

04:32.353 --> 04:34.904
He designed this place?
What a dump.

04:34.922 --> 04:36.339
Ben!
Leslie. Hi!

04:36.357 --> 04:37.975
- Hi.
- Wreston St. James.

04:38.009 --> 04:40.510
- Thank you so much for coming.
- No, thank you.

04:40.528 --> 04:42.029
Well, what do you think
of our newest park?

04:42.063 --> 04:45.565
Eh. In a word, underwhelming.
And a little inconvenient.

04:45.617 --> 04:47.117
There's no trash cans anywhere.

04:47.151 --> 04:48.368
What am I supposed to do
with my garbage,

04:48.420 --> 04:49.870
- just throw it on the ground?
- Oh, hey.

04:50.604 --> 04:52.039
Thank you for the trash!

04:52.073 --> 04:53.874
Mr. St. James,
I have to say,

04:53.908 --> 04:55.826
- this park is incredible.
- Thank you.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.912
Its official name
is "Five Mile Grounds",

04:58.963 --> 05:01.882
but we like to call it
"Wide smiles abound."

05:01.916 --> 05:04.051
Because of all the smiles
that occur?

05:04.085 --> 05:06.202
It's so boring.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.537
Come on, I'll take you guys
on a little tour.

05:07.555 --> 05:09.890
Great.
He seems super-cool.

05:09.924 --> 05:12.726
He seems cool.
Just you wait.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.398
Well, they always
wine and dine you first,

05:14.412 --> 05:16.030
but the fact
of the matter is

05:16.064 --> 05:18.232
Eagletonians are,
without exception,

05:18.267 --> 05:20.317
snobby,
condescending jerks.

05:20.352 --> 05:23.821
This is the Pawnee side
of our border with Eagleton...

05:23.855 --> 05:26.740
And this is
the Eagleton side.

05:29.577 --> 05:31.412
Ah.
Uhh.

05:31.446 --> 05:32.729
Hey, babe, it's me.

05:32.747 --> 05:34.415
Will you come down here, please,
and keep me company?

05:34.449 --> 05:36.033
I'm so bored.
I need you.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.786
If I come down there,
can I at least break something?

05:38.837 --> 05:40.504
Of course, baby.
Anything. You know that.

05:40.539 --> 05:42.039
Chris gave me
this great job

05:42.073 --> 05:43.507
as a weekend security guard
at City Hall.

05:43.542 --> 05:46.260
Only one problem--
it's a terrible job.

05:46.294 --> 05:48.179
I did everything
I was supposed to do,

05:48.213 --> 05:49.697
and I walked around
the building four times.

05:49.731 --> 05:51.182
Only 20 minutes
has gone by.

05:51.216 --> 05:53.416
Ugh! Thought maybe
ten minutes had gone by

05:53.434 --> 05:54.885
since I started talking.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.437
It's only been 15 seconds.

05:56.471 --> 05:59.773
Ohh...

05:59.808 --> 06:01.525
Oh, babe,
thank God you're here.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.944
I got so bored, I started
thinking about existence--

06:03.979 --> 06:06.397
"Do I matter?
Do any of us?

06:06.431 --> 06:09.450
Is there a master plan
in the works, a grand design?"

06:09.484 --> 06:12.119
- Just dumb stuff like that.
- Ugh! Who cares?

06:12.153 --> 06:13.871
I thought being
a security guard

06:13.905 --> 06:15.272
would be exciting.

06:15.590 --> 06:16.874
Nope.

06:17.908 --> 06:18.942
Wait a minute.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.746
Isn't this how all great
Bert Macklin cases start?

06:25.990 --> 06:27.117
It's quiet.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.121
A little too quiet.

06:31.139 --> 06:33.807
As you can see, we like to
keep things quite immaculate.

06:33.842 --> 06:37.094
I remember when Pawnee
had that massive sewage overflow

06:37.128 --> 06:38.762
in Circle Park--
whatever happened with that?

06:38.796 --> 06:41.815
- We totally fixed it.
- Well, except for the smell.

06:41.850 --> 06:45.102
The scientists think it's going
to linger for another 40 years.

06:45.136 --> 06:47.321
Can we just cut
to the chase here?

06:47.355 --> 06:49.940
Why would a fancy
Eagleton architect like you

06:49.974 --> 06:52.943
want to design
a tiny Pawnee park?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.578
Well, I heard your plea
on the radio,

06:54.613 --> 06:56.080
and you were so passionate
about the project.

06:56.114 --> 06:58.148
It doesn't matter if
it's a giant park like this

06:58.166 --> 06:59.750
or a little tiny
pocket park.

06:59.784 --> 07:01.118
It's about the people.

07:01.152 --> 07:03.003
We're here to serve them.

07:03.038 --> 07:04.622
Hey, Mr. St. James!

07:04.656 --> 07:06.423
Oh, our balloon artisan
is out of balloons.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.292
Excuse me.

07:08.326 --> 07:10.261
I have chills.
Look at my arm.

07:10.295 --> 07:12.096
Why are you so charmed
by him?

07:12.130 --> 07:14.331
You're like a Southern belle
when Rhett Butler comes around.

07:14.349 --> 07:16.383
Yes. Rhett Butler.
That's who he reminds me of.

07:16.434 --> 07:17.668
Or Bono!

07:17.686 --> 07:18.936
What?

07:18.970 --> 07:20.688
No one from Eagleton
has ever wanted to help

07:20.722 --> 07:23.307
anyone from Pawnee
for any reason.

07:23.341 --> 07:25.509
In 1988,
we were hit by a tornado.

07:25.527 --> 07:27.061
We asked Eagleton for help,

07:27.112 --> 07:29.446
and they claimed
they weren't home.

07:29.481 --> 07:33.350
An entire town
claimed they weren't home.

07:33.368 --> 07:34.818
I don't trust that guy
for a second.

07:34.852 --> 07:36.453
Leslie, look what Wreston
commissioned

07:36.488 --> 07:38.021
from the balloon artisan.

07:38.039 --> 07:39.523
It's us.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.431
Great work, team.

07:46.679 --> 07:49.431
Donna, you and your work
are ravishing, as usual.

07:49.465 --> 07:52.000
Ann, great organizational
skills.

07:52.018 --> 07:54.002
Wow. Genuine praise.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.771
It's a tip I picked up from
Lee Iacocca's autobiography.

07:56.806 --> 07:58.640
A small connection between
you and your workers

07:58.674 --> 07:59.674
helps build loyalty.

07:59.692 --> 08:02.193
Jerry!
How's the old ticker?

08:02.228 --> 08:04.279
Oh. Well, uh,
the rehab is grueling--

08:04.313 --> 08:06.031
Great!
Glad to hear it.

08:06.065 --> 08:08.066
Yo, Roomba, drop a beat!

08:08.117 --> 08:09.851
♪ Hi ho, hi ho

08:09.869 --> 08:12.020
Rent-A-Swag
is gonna be the opposite

08:12.038 --> 08:13.354
of Entertainment720.

08:13.372 --> 08:15.290
This is my last chance.

08:15.324 --> 08:17.208
If this goes down in flames,
I will have nothing

08:17.243 --> 08:18.526
except my looks.

08:18.544 --> 08:21.546
I could always pimp myself out
to hot older ladies.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.031
I need to remember that.

08:23.365 --> 08:24.899
May, 1817.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.302
A scrappy group
of frontiersmen and women

08:27.336 --> 08:29.287
arrive at a hardscrabble
chunk of land

08:29.305 --> 08:31.807
and call it Pawnee,
Indiana.

08:31.841 --> 08:33.308
We owe them
a debt of gratitude.

08:33.342 --> 08:36.344
Mm. June, 1817,
the richest among them

08:36.578 --> 08:37.979
take all of their money
from the bank

08:38.014 --> 08:39.847
and then flee up the hill
like cowards

08:39.899 --> 08:41.400
to form Eagleton.

08:41.433 --> 08:45.821
Recognize any of your ancestors
among the meanies?

08:45.855 --> 08:48.023
Actually, like most people
from the area,

08:48.074 --> 08:49.741
I have ancestors
on both sides.

08:49.776 --> 08:52.661
That's why I think this rivalry
is just a little silly

08:52.695 --> 08:55.030
- and self-defeating.
- Yeah, you may not know this,

08:55.081 --> 08:57.332
but Leslie was actually
born in Eagleton.

08:57.366 --> 09:00.118
Do not blame me
for the sins of my mother.

09:00.152 --> 09:03.088
Look, Ms. Knope,
I'm really trying here,

09:03.122 --> 09:05.457
but I just don't know
if our working together

09:05.491 --> 09:07.325
is such a great idea.

09:07.343 --> 09:09.094
Oh... running away so soon.
Typical.

09:09.128 --> 09:11.263
You know, say what you want
about Pawneeans,

09:11.297 --> 09:12.664
but we never give up.

09:12.682 --> 09:15.684
We have a mural called
"The Many Surrenders of Pawnee."

09:15.718 --> 09:17.436
Oh, look who's paying
attention to me now!

09:17.470 --> 09:19.805
Okay. Can I speak to you
privately for a minute?

09:21.557 --> 09:23.391
The name is special agent
Bert Macklin.

09:23.443 --> 09:25.227
Tell me who you are,
who you work for,

09:25.278 --> 09:26.728
and don't bother trying
to lie to me,

09:26.779 --> 09:27.946
because I'm amazing.

09:27.980 --> 09:29.614
My name is Judy Hitler,

09:29.649 --> 09:31.983
and I am the spoiled
only daughter of Adolf.

09:32.517 --> 09:33.902
And I'm going to tell my Daddy

09:33.953 --> 09:36.154
you were mean to me,
Bert Macklin.

09:36.188 --> 09:37.856
He's not going to
like it very much.

09:37.874 --> 09:40.459
- So untie me!
- Nice try, Miss Hitler,

09:40.493 --> 09:42.410
but you have something
that I want.

09:42.462 --> 09:44.713
Where's the necklace with
all of Germany's war secrets?

09:44.747 --> 09:46.631
I don't know what
you are talking about.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.550
- I think you do!
- I don't!

09:50.720 --> 09:52.921
Now, you give me
that war-ending necklace,

09:52.972 --> 09:54.639
or I will resort to torture.

09:54.674 --> 09:57.893
Fine. I will show you
where it is, damn it.

09:58.627 --> 09:59.978
You're too good, Macklin.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.563
Don't you do it, Hitler.

10:01.597 --> 10:03.732
Don't you dare
fall in love with me.

10:05.951 --> 10:08.103
Oh, Hitler, you sexy bastard.
No!

10:08.154 --> 10:11.406
- Yes!
- Mm...Mm!

10:11.440 --> 10:14.893
Aah!

10:14.911 --> 10:17.829
I am just filled
to the brim with questions.

10:17.864 --> 10:19.197
Why are you using
this wood?

10:19.231 --> 10:21.666
Is it more pliable?
What are these metal latches?

10:21.701 --> 10:23.952
Are they copper or brass?
Is one better?

10:24.003 --> 10:25.837
And if so, why?

10:25.872 --> 10:28.623
If I tell you, then you won't
have learned anything.

10:30.042 --> 10:32.076
Another in a long line
of lessons

10:32.094 --> 10:34.346
from the great Ron Swanson.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.047
My therapist,
Dr. Richard Nygard,

10:36.081 --> 10:40.051
suggested that I try some
non-exercise-based hobbies.

10:40.085 --> 10:42.220
So I've been studying
woodworking with Ron.

10:43.454 --> 10:44.906
I made this.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.259
Before I started,
it was bigger.

10:48.277 --> 10:51.613
Here. I have designed
something very important.

10:51.647 --> 10:53.565
Why don't you start work
on that right away?

10:53.599 --> 10:54.900
Yes, sir!

10:54.934 --> 10:59.103
It's a flight of stairs
that leads to nowhere.

10:59.121 --> 11:00.322
Were you listening to him

11:00.373 --> 11:02.290
when he was talking about
serving the public

11:02.325 --> 11:04.275
and making our communities
better?

11:04.293 --> 11:06.161
You know who
he sounds like, right?

11:06.212 --> 11:07.329
Yes. Idi Amin.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.381
- Or Lord Voldemort.
- No. You.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.115
Now, you've been
very rude to him,

11:11.133 --> 11:13.251
and you need to apologize.

11:13.285 --> 11:15.170
Ha ha ha.
You are a laugh riot, Ben.

11:15.221 --> 11:17.589
I am never going to apologize
to someone from Eagleton.

11:17.623 --> 11:19.090
All right.
So you can kiss your park

11:19.124 --> 11:20.725
and four years of work
good-bye.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
Up to you.

11:22.794 --> 11:24.095
Come on. You can do it.

11:24.129 --> 11:25.597
- I don't want to.
- You can--

11:25.931 --> 11:27.567
You can do it.

11:28.601 --> 11:30.101
Mr. St. James,

11:30.135 --> 11:32.153
this has been a strange day.

11:32.188 --> 11:33.471
But we wouldn't
want to leave you

11:33.489 --> 11:34.773
with the wrong impression
of Pawnee.

11:35.307 --> 11:37.442
Have you guys seen Hitler?

11:40.496 --> 11:42.647
Anyway, we would love

11:42.665 --> 11:44.916
to have you design the park,

11:44.951 --> 11:46.501
and in the spirit
of reconciliation,

11:46.535 --> 11:48.787
Leslie would like to
apologize.

11:48.821 --> 11:50.788
I may have allowed
my prejudices,

11:50.822 --> 11:54.659
my totally legitimate
prejudices against Eagleton

11:54.677 --> 11:57.262
affect my feelings towards your
involvement in this project,

11:57.296 --> 11:58.513
and so therefore,

11:58.547 --> 12:00.433
I would like to say that I'm--

12:01.467 --> 12:03.518
I'm...

12:04.352 --> 12:05.937
I'm Leslie Knope.

12:06.972 --> 12:07.922
No.

12:07.956 --> 12:09.307
That's not what
I want to say. Okay.

12:10.342 --> 12:12.176
I'm...

12:12.194 --> 12:14.479
Sss...

12:14.513 --> 12:16.648
My mouth is kinda dry.

12:17.182 --> 12:19.017
My mouth is dry.
This is Canada Dry.

12:19.035 --> 12:21.453
Drink Canada Dry
if your mouth is dry.

12:21.487 --> 12:24.122
That's nothing.
What I want to say is

12:24.156 --> 12:25.907
I'm s...

12:25.958 --> 12:27.492
I'm sor...

12:27.526 --> 12:28.860
I'm sor--

12:28.878 --> 12:30.862
He's a human being.
You're a human being.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.530
You can just--
just say--

12:32.548 --> 12:34.198
I'm sor--

12:34.216 --> 12:35.667
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

12:35.701 --> 12:36.968
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:37.003 --> 12:39.004
I'm sorry that I--
I'm sorry, very sorry,

12:39.638 --> 12:40.722
that I was rude.

12:42.341 --> 12:43.842
- It's too soon.
- You know what,

12:43.876 --> 12:46.177
as a gesture of good will,
I'd like to waive my fee.

12:46.211 --> 12:47.896
I'll design the park
pro bono.

12:48.730 --> 12:49.597
Thank you.

12:49.649 --> 12:51.382
That's very nice of you.
I've been working up

12:51.400 --> 12:53.985
a little model of the design.
Why don't I bring it over,

12:54.019 --> 12:55.353
and we can all
go through it together.

12:55.387 --> 12:57.322
Great. And then you can
come to our wedding.

12:57.356 --> 12:58.723
- Huh?
- What?

12:58.741 --> 13:00.058
It's in May, and we haven't
planned it yet,

13:00.076 --> 13:01.527
but save the date.

13:03.663 --> 13:05.230
I was never here.

13:06.748 --> 13:09.067
- Ah!
- Aah!

13:11.086 --> 13:12.037
Well done, team.

13:12.971 --> 13:13.905
What do you think
of the place?

13:13.923 --> 13:16.207
Do you really like
this yellow paint?

13:16.241 --> 13:17.342
I mean,
I know it was on sale,

13:17.376 --> 13:19.243
but it looks a lot
like dried phlegm.

13:19.261 --> 13:21.012
For real, Tom.
This place is sad.

13:21.047 --> 13:24.182
I think one of the mannequins
tried to commit suicide.

13:24.216 --> 13:25.600
I think what's important
is we all had a goal,

13:25.634 --> 13:27.052
and we achieved it.

13:27.086 --> 13:29.971
- So you like the place?
- Oh, no, it's quite terrible.

13:30.022 --> 13:31.523
This is the best
I can do for now.

13:31.557 --> 13:33.858
And I'm $46 under budget.

13:33.893 --> 13:35.477
Now I have a small treat
for you guys

13:35.528 --> 13:36.811
for all your hard work.

13:36.862 --> 13:39.230
Pizza party!

13:39.264 --> 13:41.282
One small pizza
for all of us.

13:41.317 --> 13:42.701
With no toppings.

13:42.735 --> 13:44.152
Cheese is a topping, Jerry.

13:44.703 --> 13:46.604
And why are these lights
blaring, by the way?

13:46.622 --> 13:49.207
Does someone here own stock
in the electric company?

13:51.876 --> 13:54.079
If there were more food
and fewer people,

13:54.113 --> 13:56.214
this would be a perfect party.

13:56.248 --> 13:57.882
You can't run, Hitler.

13:57.917 --> 13:59.834
82nd airborne
is everywhere!

14:00.685 --> 14:01.586
History channel.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.321
Ho ho ho!

14:03.455 --> 14:04.288
What is this?

14:04.306 --> 14:07.392
A child spy,
sent to steal the necklace?

14:07.426 --> 14:09.761
Bert Macklin, FBI!
Freeze!

14:09.795 --> 14:11.596
I didn't do anything!

14:11.630 --> 14:13.515
- Yeah, bad call, Bert.
- Oh.

14:13.566 --> 14:15.066
Oh, hey, I'm just kidding,
buddy.

14:15.101 --> 14:17.602
I'm just playing around.
My name's really Andy Dwyer.

14:17.636 --> 14:18.436
I'm a security guard.

14:18.470 --> 14:20.355
- What's your name?
- Joey.

14:20.406 --> 14:23.141
I was with my mom,
and I got lost.

14:23.159 --> 14:24.526
Oh. Well, gosh,
don't worry about that.

14:24.577 --> 14:26.778
I've gotten lost here
about 500 times,

14:26.812 --> 14:28.196
and I work here.

14:28.247 --> 14:30.165
What do you say we go
find your mom, huh?

14:33.101 --> 14:34.702
She's not in there.  I'll bet.

14:34.754 --> 14:36.538
Let's try this way.

14:36.589 --> 14:37.789
Hello?

14:37.823 --> 14:39.824
Ms. Knope, Mr. Wyatt?

14:39.842 --> 14:41.459
We're from
Wreston St. James' firm.

14:41.493 --> 14:42.877
Oh, hey, come on in.

14:42.928 --> 14:44.262
Where's Wreston?

14:44.296 --> 14:45.964
He's on his way.
He wanted us to get started.

14:45.998 --> 14:49.300
Aw! Oh, well.
Okay, I guess go ahead.

14:49.334 --> 14:52.336
We present
the Crown Jewel of Pawnee

14:53.054 --> 14:56.808
containing the sights, sounds,
and most importantly,

14:56.842 --> 14:58.943
smells that define your city.

14:58.978 --> 15:00.228
There are several
drool buckets

15:00.279 --> 15:02.063
for your more...
slack-jawed citizens.

15:02.114 --> 15:04.616
We also have food troughs
full of cheeseburgers

15:04.650 --> 15:06.484
and public showers

15:06.518 --> 15:09.654
with instructions for those
who've never showered before.

15:09.688 --> 15:11.689
You have five seconds
to get out of here...

15:12.207 --> 15:14.358
Or I will rip your throats out.

15:14.376 --> 15:16.244
Out.
Now.

15:16.295 --> 15:20.198
Oh, hey, my backyard
is bigger than your park.

15:20.216 --> 15:22.366
Leslie, stay back, stay back.

15:27.341 --> 15:30.528
I told you that Eagletonians
are awful, terrible people.

15:30.529 --> 15:33.280
They call their boogers
Pawnee caviar.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.532
I'm on your side,

15:34.566 --> 15:36.433
and I'm furious too.

15:36.451 --> 15:38.586
But this just doesn't
make sense to me.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.103
I'm gonna talk to Wreston,

15:40.121 --> 15:41.689
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

15:41.723 --> 15:42.990
Any excuse
to talk to Wreston.

15:43.041 --> 15:45.042
Well, I am gonna think
about a revenge plan.

15:45.076 --> 15:46.210
I know what we're gonna do.

15:46.244 --> 15:47.328
We're gonna find out
where he lives.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.712
We're gonna drive
to his house.

15:48.747 --> 15:50.280
We're gonna set it on fire
and watch it burn.

15:50.298 --> 15:51.615
Leslie, we can't do that.

15:51.633 --> 15:54.969
You're right.
We can't.

15:56.387 --> 15:58.538
All right, so...

15:58.556 --> 16:00.373
Does this look familiar?

16:00.391 --> 16:02.876
- No, not at all.
- I was talking to Joey.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.228
- Joey!
- Mommy!

16:04.262 --> 16:05.345
There you are.

16:05.379 --> 16:07.765
Oh, God, I was so worried.

16:07.816 --> 16:09.316
Thank you so much.

16:09.350 --> 16:10.934
You'll never know how much
I appreciate it.

16:10.985 --> 16:13.720
Well, just doing
my job, ma'am.

16:13.738 --> 16:15.272
Thank you for saving me, Andy.

16:15.323 --> 16:17.407
Thank you, too, miss Hitler.

16:17.442 --> 16:19.159
- What?
- Don't worry about it.

16:19.594 --> 16:22.112
Wow. You made those losers
very happy.

16:22.163 --> 16:23.730
Oh, no, I didn't.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.398
- Bert Macklin did.
- No...

16:25.416 --> 16:26.834
- FBI.
- Actually,

16:26.868 --> 16:29.670
Bert Macklin kinda made
that little boy cry.

16:29.704 --> 16:32.906
Well, he's a rogue agent who
refuses to play by the rules.

16:32.924 --> 16:35.342
Seriously, I think Andy Dwyer
makes a better real cop

16:35.376 --> 16:37.544
than Bert Macklin.
Maybe it's time for Bert Macklin

16:37.578 --> 16:39.298
to hang up his shades.

16:42.183 --> 16:43.934
Can I get you something
to drink?

16:43.969 --> 16:46.053
Iced tea, please.
And can I ask you,

16:46.104 --> 16:48.138
how are there palm trees
here?

16:48.172 --> 16:49.773
Well, Eagleton lies
on top of a hot spring

16:49.808 --> 16:52.059
which creates
a micro-climate zone.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.612
We are...
truly blessed.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.181
God, I'm so sorry
I'm late.

16:58.199 --> 16:59.817
What the hell happened,
man?

16:59.851 --> 17:02.352
I had nothing to do
with that stupid prank.

17:02.370 --> 17:03.787
In fact,
that's why I'm late.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.372
I was firing the two people
who were responsible,

17:05.406 --> 17:06.991
and I was escorting them
out of the building.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.492
Well...Good!

17:08.526 --> 17:10.243
Certain people in the firm

17:10.295 --> 17:13.163
wanted to promote them,
but I insisted they be fired.

17:13.196 --> 17:15.198
If you swear to me
that you're serious,

17:15.215 --> 17:16.666
maybe we can salvage this.

17:16.701 --> 17:20.203
I would really love to.
But what about Leslie?

17:20.221 --> 17:21.872
I just doubt
that she can ever get over

17:21.890 --> 17:23.257
the bad blood
between our towns.

17:23.308 --> 17:24.508
I think you're wrong.

17:24.541 --> 17:26.477
Leslie
is a very forgiving person.

17:26.511 --> 17:28.045
Revenge!
Ha ha hal

17:28.063 --> 17:31.599
This is for Pawnee,
you butt-faced pompous jerk!

17:31.650 --> 17:33.383
Whoo!

17:33.401 --> 17:34.568
I love you, Ben.

17:34.603 --> 17:35.986
Pawnee forever!

17:36.021 --> 17:38.856
You want a stupid tie?
I'll give you a stupid tie.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.609
Ha ha!
Wreston, suck it.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.360
- Now we're even.
- Leslie.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.079
- Huh?
- He didn't do it,

17:45.113 --> 17:46.914
and he fired the people
who did.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.906
Attention, please.

17:55.924 --> 17:57.458
I've been going over
the books,

17:57.509 --> 18:00.010
and I'm missing $9.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.245
Now, I'm not angry
at whoever took it.

18:02.263 --> 18:03.464
Just come forward.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.182
You'll be served
with a lawsuit,

18:05.216 --> 18:07.417
and we will move on
with our lives.

18:07.435 --> 18:10.420
Hey, buddy, let's go get
some breakfast, okay?

18:10.438 --> 18:12.356
Fine. It was your idea,
so you're paying.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.257
You're driving.
I'm not chipping in for gas.

18:14.275 --> 18:15.310
Okay. All right.

18:16.861 --> 18:18.395
I'll have
the pancake breakfast.

18:18.429 --> 18:20.614
Oh, let me also get
12 eggs, uncooked,

18:20.648 --> 18:22.315
and some toast.

18:22.366 --> 18:24.768
20 slices, untoasted,
in a row in a bag.

18:24.786 --> 18:26.904
You want a carton of eggs
and a loaf of bread.

18:26.938 --> 18:28.939
Yeah, just the pancake
breakfast is fine.

18:29.357 --> 18:31.575
Don't offer to pay
if you're gonna be cheap.

18:31.609 --> 18:33.827
Listen, man, I know you don't
want to repeat the mistakes

18:33.878 --> 18:35.496
of Entertainment 720,
and that's great,

18:35.547 --> 18:37.548
but you're gonna need
a little bit of the old Tom

18:37.582 --> 18:38.832
to make this business work.

18:38.883 --> 18:40.918
No. That Tom ruined
everything.

18:40.952 --> 18:42.252
Yes, he did,

18:42.286 --> 18:45.139
and that Tom made you
a horrible boyfriend

18:45.173 --> 18:47.958
and a terrible employee
and drove you to bankruptcy.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.727
Are we nearing the point?

18:49.761 --> 18:51.395
But your swagger
and your showmanship

18:51.429 --> 18:53.063
and your confidence
is part of you,

18:53.098 --> 18:54.765
and in small doses,
it can help.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.934
You can't have Rent-A-Swag
without the swag.

18:56.968 --> 19:00.237
I barely have enough cash
to get everything set up.

19:00.271 --> 19:01.689
I know.
Take this.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.975
We all chipped in.
Use it to spruce up the store.

19:04.993 --> 19:06.360
And in return you can give us

19:06.411 --> 19:08.078
like one share of stock
in the company.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.814
Like a mini public offering.

19:11.082 --> 19:12.983
"Smort", Ann.
Smort.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.251
This is a cause
for celebration.

19:14.525 --> 19:17.504
Waiter! Eight strips
of bacon, uncooked,

19:17.505 --> 19:19.340
in a sealed package.

19:20.591 --> 19:22.710
I call it
the Pawnee Commons,

19:22.761 --> 19:24.712
a celebration of Pawnee's
history and people.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.347
A Wamapoke-themed
playground...

19:27.382 --> 19:29.783
Food trucks
from local restaurants,

19:29.818 --> 19:31.452
Li'l Sebastian fountain.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.520
- I mean, it's perfect.
- Thank you.

19:33.555 --> 19:34.988
I can't see myself
fighting you

19:35.023 --> 19:37.307
on more than
60% of these ideas.

19:37.341 --> 19:39.560
I'd expect no less.
I'm just glad you like it.

19:39.611 --> 19:40.611
I've never met two people

19:40.645 --> 19:42.780
more passionate
about their hometown.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.565
Oh, I'm actually from
Minnesota.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.233
Why do you know so much
about Pawnee?

19:46.284 --> 19:49.186
Well, I'm in love
with a woman from here.

19:49.204 --> 19:52.489
A strange, passionate,
goof ball of a woman.

19:53.623 --> 19:55.159
Me. He's in love with me.

19:58.996 --> 20:00.697
I'm sorry to see you go,
Macklin.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.217
You didn't always
play by the rules,

20:03.251 --> 20:05.469
but damn it,
you were a hell of an agent.

20:05.503 --> 20:08.005
Today I say good-bye to
the only life I've ever known.

20:08.339 --> 20:10.507
Well, some of the boys
chipped in

20:10.541 --> 20:12.077
and we got you...

20:12.641 --> 20:13.877
This.

20:14.395 --> 20:17.431
It isn't much, but it's
something to remember us by.

20:19.567 --> 20:23.353
40 years undercover.
I never even met my family.

20:23.387 --> 20:25.272
- What?
- And this is all I have

20:25.323 --> 20:27.524
to show for it?

20:28.058 --> 20:29.193
Totally worth it.

20:30.227 --> 20:32.112
It's been a pleasure
serving with you, son.

20:32.163 --> 20:34.031
If you ever need me,
you know where to find me--

20:34.065 --> 20:36.667
In bed next to you,
probably having sex with you.

Welcome to the new
<i>new</i> Rent-A-Swag

20:51.700 --> 20:53.616
now with 30% more swag.

20:53.618 --> 20:55.452
I used the money
you guys gave me

20:55.454 --> 20:56.953
to add a little flair,

20:56.955 --> 20:58.688
and I took everything
I own in my house

20:58.690 --> 21:00.123
and brought it here,
except for my bed.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.291
I basically live here now.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.692
I hate all of this,

21:02.694 --> 21:04.962
which probably means
it's good for your business.

21:04.964 --> 21:09.032
Ron, my woodworking project--
it's for displaying shoes!

21:09.034 --> 21:11.668
Yes. That was always
the plan.

21:11.670 --> 21:12.837
All right,
Rent-A-Swag team,

21:12.839 --> 21:15.806
I have one more little
surprise for you--pizza party!

21:15.808 --> 21:17.224
- Part Two.
- Oh, wow!

21:17.226 --> 21:20.060
Two pizzas.
And toppings!

21:20.062 --> 21:22.777
Only on half.
I'm not Zuckerberg.

21:22.778 --> 21:23.777
Eat up, chumps.
