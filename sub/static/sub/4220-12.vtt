What have we got?

01:38.515 --> 01:43.936
We got chlorine powder,
bags of cat litter,
brake fluid, vegetable oil...

01:44.021 --> 01:45.313
All in bulk.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.899
Yeah, homie definitely had
peculiar taste when he hit
the Sam's Club.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.777

02:22.351 --> 02:23.976
Thing is, it's not
exactly a crime scene.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.562
It's gonna be real hard
to pull forensics in on this.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.649
We know it's a long shot
and arson's almost
impossible to prove,

02:29.733 --> 02:32.819
but even if it
just rules it out,
we'd sleep better.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.321
Can't make any promises,
but I'll see what I can do.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.489

a lot to y'all.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.949

Thank you.

The items discovered at that

to us all here at 51.

As of now, there is no
indication of foul play.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.548

the matter will
be looked into.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.449
Detective Boden.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.992
Hey.
Hey.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.160
How are ya?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.288
Look at the
little Chief.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.917
Ah! He's even got the
old man's furrowed brow.
DONNA: Yeah, he does.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.001
HERRMANN: Wow.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.753
Bet he's got a better
disposition, huh?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.004
DONNA: Oh, come on!
Hey, hey, hey.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.297
(ALL LAUGHING)

14:02.175 --> 14:03.342
Hey.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.718
Hey, Donna.
Hey.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.845
Hey, Pop.
Give me the baby.
Okay.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.180
(LAUGHS) Come on.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.098
Detective Boden!

14:11.184 --> 14:14.144
(LAUGHING)
So great to see you.

14:14.354 --> 14:19.316
This gentleman right here is
who I dedicate my illustrious
career with the CFD to.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.567
"Illustrious?"

14:20.652 --> 14:22.611
Let me show you something
that will make your
heart stop.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.821
Bam.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.241
Oh!
Come on.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.618
Taken the day I graduated
from the Academy.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.412
This man believed in me
from the jump.

14:32.956 --> 14:33.997
Am I wrong, Detective?

14:34.457 --> 14:38.544
Randall, you have exceeded
my wildest dreams and
my expectations.

14:42.465 --> 14:46.969
Times change, maybe,
but Randall McHolland,
he stays the same.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.096
Yes, he does.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.056
Right here?
Okay.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.143
You're feeding the
baby too much, Donna.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.646
Thanks.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.065
That's why he
keeps spitting up.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.900
I'll ask the
doctor about it.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.735
And your
burping technique.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.821
Well, now,
that's something
we can work on.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.159
Any chance of you joining us
for the well-baby check?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.744
I would love to,
Donna, but you know...

15:12.829 --> 15:14.079
Hey, don't worry, son.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.581
I'll be there.

15:16.833 --> 15:17.916
Thanks, Pop.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.044
Ah.
He's spitting up again.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.297
Shoot.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.099
You see the burn pattern?

15:35.226 --> 15:36.518
The V-shape?
Yeah.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.562
That's where the fire
ignited the blast, right?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.069
But they didn't find
any signs of arson.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.031
No accelerants. Nothing.
Right.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.712
But this is where I
saw the squatters' fire.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.465
What are you saying?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.051
If this is where the fire
started, the burn pattern
should be here.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.261
Not over there.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.809
Are you sure
that's where it was?

16:17.894 --> 16:19.478
Yeah.
A hundred percent.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.355
This is my landmark.
This pole.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.484
That's worth
running by Arson.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.652
You know anybody?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.111
Yeah. I do.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.326
Wanted to see me,
Lieutenant?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.036
Yeah, Chicago Med called.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.123
They're having trouble
tracking down a next of kin
for Chaplain Orlovsky.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.834
I see.
Yeah.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.170
You know him
pretty well, right?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.296
Any ideas?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.674
Yeah. I met his
mother one time.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.759
I'll sniff around,
see what I can find out.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.761
All right. Thanks.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.596
They say if he's
going to make it?

16:54.764 --> 16:55.764
Uh,

16:57.100 --> 16:58.475
he's still unconscious.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.103
Could go either way.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.023
For what it's worth,

17:05.108 --> 17:07.943
doing anything different
could've put 'em both
in the grave.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.949
You made the right call,
Lieutenant.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.747
All you can do is
play it like it comes.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.126
Appreciate that, Herrmann.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.295
I'll let you know
what I find out.
(ALARM BUZZING)

17:27.588 --> 17:30.632
DISPATCHER OVER PA:
Ambulance 61, adult female
with head injuries,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.801
3331 West 17th.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.184
Did someone call
for a paramedic?

17:41.811 --> 17:42.769
(KNOCKING)

17:42.854 --> 17:44.479
Fire department.
Open up.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.818
Ma'am, is everything okay?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.738
I'm fine.
Sorry to trouble you.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.491
Looks worse than it is.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.243
I'm a bleeder.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.786
We're happy to take a look.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.663
Um, my neighbor
must've heard me yell.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.667
I was coming down the
stairs and I tripped.
I'm fine. Really.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.212
Ma'am, you sure
that you're okay?

18:09.464 --> 18:10.756
You heard her.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.764
Look,
we get in there,
you set her aside.

18:18.848 --> 18:19.931
I'm gonna square off
with that husband.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.476
If she gives any
acknowledgment of being beat,

18:22.602 --> 18:24.853
anything at all,
we call the cops in,
okay?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.856
Got it.
All right.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.277
Ma'am.
We need you to open up.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.906
Look, ma'am,
you can decline treatment,

18:36.032 --> 18:38.033
but we're not gonna
leave until you sign
a refusal.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.581
Have a seat, ma'am.
I'll take a look at you.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.041
I'm fine, really.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.669
Did you see
what happened?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.464
Nothing, huh?

18:53.174 --> 18:54.299
Nope.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.929
There something
I need to sign or...

18:59.013 --> 19:00.555
You can talk
to me, okay?

19:01.265 --> 19:04.351
This bruise on the
side of your face,
is that a slap mark?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.436
What? No.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.647
If he hurt you,
we can get you out
of here. I promise.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.900
Hey, can I help you
with something?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.401
This is my place.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.404
And that's my wife
and she said she's fine.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.907
Well, she doesn't look fine.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.495
I don't want
treatment, okay?

19:46.727 --> 19:48.103
Sign here.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.528
Hey.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.114
Uh, I'm not trying to
get in your business.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.866
Just checking
on my partner.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.869
I'm fine.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.295
That domestic,
it just got under
my skin, that's all.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.756
I made an appointment
with Boden's guy.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.675
The counselor?
Yeah?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.468
We could go together.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.470
I mean, if you want.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.473
Thanks anyway.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.478
WOMAN:
I'm not saying there's
not something there.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.107
But Arson reached the same
conclusion you did the
day of the accident.

20:34.191 --> 20:38.153
Squatters cooking on an open
flame caused a hundred gallon
propane tank to explode.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.990
Neither Arson nor anyone
else knew the burn patterns

20:42.074 --> 20:43.825
were in a different place
from where I saw the fire.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.827
I didn't even know it
myself until we went back.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.953
I hear you, Kelly.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.539
And it, it's interesting,
but inconclusive.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.668
Look, Leslie Shay wasn't just
some victim in this fire.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.712
And she wasn't just a
paramedic on 61.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.797
She was my partner.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.259
For five and a half years.
And his best friend.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.886
So if there's even the
slightest bit of maybe,

21:02.970 --> 21:05.180
we will walk through hell
to find out for sure.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.232
The investigator in charge
of the case is by the book.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.319
To be frank,
he's a bit of a dick.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.739
All he shared with
me was the summary.

21:26.744 --> 21:27.953
No guarantees, all right?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.789
But let me see if I can
pull the file so you can
take a look.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.418
Thank you.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.802
(SLAMMING)

21:48.057 --> 21:50.600
Used to take his mom
to hear his sermons
on Sundays.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.019
Then they'd go for blintzes
at the Golden Apple.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.647
Good egg, Mrs. Orlovsky.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.607
You got a number for her?

21:57.900 --> 21:59.526
She passed about
six months ago.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.488
(SIGHS)

22:03.572 --> 22:08.576
Been trying to paint this
place for years, but the
Chaplain won't let me.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.787
Says he doesn't want
me wasting the money.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.249
Any idea where he keeps
his address book?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.501
Maybe I can find a number
for another relative.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.504
Nah, but you're welcome
to poke around.

22:20.715 --> 22:21.923
He's in pretty
rough shape, huh?

22:23.384 --> 22:24.426
Critical condition.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.178
Hope he pulls through.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.431
Yeah. Me too.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.017
Ain't that the way life is?

22:33.144 --> 22:34.185
How's that?

22:34.270 --> 22:36.563
Chaplain's always taking
care of everybody else.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.941
But never had anybody
to look out for him.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.158
We'd like to welcome
each and every one of you
to this year's Pee Wee

22:48.242 --> 22:50.035
Single A Hockey Draft.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.369
(CHEERING)

22:51.454 --> 22:53.997
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pardon me, Commissioner.
Listen.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.624
I just want to remind everyone
that we're here for the kids.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.837
So, let's have a fun and
respectful evening and we'll
have a terrific season,

23:00.921 --> 23:01.880
all right?

23:01.964 --> 23:03.048
Whoo!
Welcome back, Mad Dog!

23:03.132 --> 23:04.215
Right there!

23:04.300 --> 23:05.508
(CHEERING)

23:06.302 --> 23:07.302
Be right back.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.222
Hey.
(INAUDIBLE)

23:11.307 --> 23:14.225
Now, to ensure parity
in League play,

23:14.310 --> 23:16.978
each of your kids has been
ranked on the scale
from one to five.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.023
Each team will have no more
than three players for
any given category...

23:20.107 --> 23:22.901
Check it out.
Reason Herrmann
got banned...

23:22.985 --> 23:24.152
Oh.
I'm dying to hear this.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.613
Championship game
two years ago.
Ten seconds left, right?

23:27.323 --> 23:29.991
Herrmann's older kid,
Lee Henry,
gets a breakaway.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.744
Out of nowhere, kid from
the other team trips him
from behind.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.456
Mmm.
The other coach distracted
the ref so he never saw it.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.292
Oh.
Herrmann must've
been so steamed.

23:39.376 --> 23:43.338
He broke into the
Commissioner's car, stole all
the first-place trophies and

23:43.464 --> 23:45.048
gave it to his kids instead.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.299
(LAUGHING)

23:46.383 --> 23:48.551
He left one behind,
though, except he tried

23:48.636 --> 23:51.137
to cross out the word
"Champions" and wrote
in "Cheaters."

23:51.222 --> 23:52.347
(LAUGHING)

23:52.431 --> 23:57.268
Now, in the threes,
we've got Magonia,
Lauritzen and Herrmann.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
A three?
You're giving my kid a three?

23:59.855 --> 24:02.148
What'd your kid get?
Five, but...

24:02.233 --> 24:03.900
Yeah, five, right.
You know what?
Your kid...

24:04.026 --> 24:05.276
Oh, this is all on you.
I got to bounce.
Hey.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.779
You know what? If you run
this league like you run
your business...

24:07.863 --> 24:10.198
You know what, your kid
couldn't play hockey on
a basketball court.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.868
Uh... Happy Hour at Molly's!
Two for one drinks for
every dad in Pee Wees, huh?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.286
(CHEERING)

24:23.045 --> 24:24.754
(GRUNTS)

24:24.839 --> 24:28.049
So, what do you guys think?

24:28.801 --> 24:29.843
What is it?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.886
It's my dad's old
footlocker from the Navy.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.388
Sylvie mentioned you guys
needed a coffee table.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.722
I thought this
would be perfect.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.350
It's great.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.518
Right?

24:39.895 --> 24:40.937
Beer, anyone?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.063
Ah, yes, please.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.356
Herrmann wore me out.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.691
DAWSON:
Oh, he will do that to you.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.484
Uh, I don't think
I have any, actually.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.236
Oh, yes, you do.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.071
Oh.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.411
Ah.
The perks of
having a roommate.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.829
A-ha.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.211
BRETT: When my brother
turned three, my parents
made us share a room.

25:05.963 --> 25:11.092
I remember he came
running in and yelled,
"Sylvie, we're mermaids!"

25:11.177 --> 25:12.844
(LAUGHING)

25:13.762 --> 25:14.804
He meant to say roomies.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.139
That's adorable.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.515
Yes, it was.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.475
CRUZ: Left something
in the truck. Be right back.

25:19.602 --> 25:23.021
(DOOR SHUTS)
So, uh, he's certainly
enthusiastic, huh?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.775
In ways you
can't even imagine.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.863
(GULPS) For real?

25:32.823 --> 25:34.824
Yep. Yeah.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.327
Wow.
Good for you.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.164
What about you?

25:41.248 --> 25:42.540
How you holding up?

25:44.960 --> 25:48.796
I'm just, uh, just trying to
keep the Chaplain off my mind,
you know.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.674
You two were close, huh?

25:53.302 --> 25:54.886
He was there for me
when I needed him.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.641
I'm glad you're here.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.645
Yeah, me, too.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.105
Mermaids.
Mermaids.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.483
(LAUGHING)

26:09.693 --> 26:10.818
(EXHALES)

26:12.404 --> 26:13.738
(BABY CRIES SOFTLY)

26:13.822 --> 26:15.823
(EXHALES) God, um...

26:18.994 --> 26:21.204
There's something...
Okay, um...

26:21.830 --> 26:23.331
(MUTTERING)

26:23.415 --> 26:24.666
You're sure he's not gonna
roll off the table?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.000
He's eight days old.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.086
Sure.
Like this, right?

26:28.170 --> 26:29.170
(BABY CRIES)

26:29.588 --> 26:30.922
You just gotta
get up in there.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.674
Don't rush me.
I'm not rushing you.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.094
So it's like this...
Mmm-hmm.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.304
(SPUTTERS)

26:38.389 --> 26:41.474
Yeah.
We got this. Yeah.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.934
And there is your son.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.811
Oh.
He's hungry.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.521
Oh, hungry?
Yeah.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.814
You know what?

26:48.065 --> 26:52.652
If one more person tells
me that my baby is either
hungry or full, I swear...

26:52.736 --> 26:53.736
Okay, I'm sorry.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.823
No. No. You have to talk
to him tonight, Wallace.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.324
I know. I am. I will.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.784
You know, God love him,
but your father is just

26:59.868 --> 27:01.202
driving me around
the bend right now.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.247
Donna, Donna,
I will handle it.

27:08.877 --> 27:09.919
Okay.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.092
You got a beautiful
life here, son.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.220
Pop, we gotta talk.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.223
I'm Stage Four.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.143
What?

27:25.227 --> 27:27.395
Oncologist gave me about
four months to live...

27:40.826 --> 27:41.826
Hey!

27:41.910 --> 27:43.036
Oh, don't get up.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.954
Sorry I kept you.
Took longer than I thought.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.789
Oh, no, I'm just grateful
you could take the time.

27:48.751 --> 27:51.294
Uh, you got
decaf green tea?

27:51.712 --> 27:52.754
Sure.

27:54.381 --> 27:58.676
So the investigator
assigned to the case,
this guy Bill Jensen,

27:58.761 --> 27:59.886
stonewalled me when
I asked for the file.

28:00.429 --> 28:01.512
Okay.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.391
But one good thing about
the antiquated interoffice
mail system

28:05.476 --> 28:08.019
is that you can get
access to any file.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.940
It took me a while to snap
pics of every document.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.693
But in the end,
I got it done.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.200
How can I thank you?

28:22.618 --> 28:23.826
Oh.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.331
Thanks.

28:30.667 --> 28:34.629
My first year on the job,
I had this field training
officer,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.130
Graham Tracey.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.301
He taught me the ropes,
blocked for me.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.263
Just an amazing
human being.

28:45.265 --> 28:50.061
One night we get called
to a structure fire on
South Racine.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.607
He makes this incredible save,

28:54.691 --> 28:57.527
pulls out an eight-year-old
kid right before the roof
came down.

28:58.904 --> 29:03.533
He was making one last
trip up the ladder
when his foot slipped.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.993
Thirty-five foot drop.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.662
Died on impact.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.165
I'm sorry.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.919
I know what it's like
to lose a fellow firefighter.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.051
Do whatever you got to do.

29:30.853 --> 29:31.853
(KNOCKING)

29:32.646 --> 29:33.688
What's up?

29:34.481 --> 29:37.442
Uh, I just got off the
phone with Chief Hatcher.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.986
Apparently, CFD approved
the alderman's request

29:40.070 --> 29:42.029
for a dedication ceremony
in Shay's honor.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.157
That's great, right?
Yeah.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.410
It's gonna be, um,
next Thursday here at 51.

29:47.578 --> 29:51.706
Kelly, I was hoping
that either you or Dawson
would say a few words.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.374
Yeah, of course.

29:54.042 --> 29:58.588
In light of the storage unit
fire, I understand if it's
not a good time.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.298
It's never not a good time.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.217
Then, uh, then that's all.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.262
Thanks, Chief.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.979
Chief, everything okay?

30:18.484 --> 30:19.901
It's my father.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.278
He's not doing well.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.074
Sounds serious.

30:27.618 --> 30:28.618
It is.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.370
If there's
anything we can do, I...

30:33.415 --> 30:35.333
I just need two minutes
to myself right now.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.711
Absolutely.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.267
(EXHALES)

30:59.525 --> 31:00.775
Atwater, what's up?

31:00.859 --> 31:03.528
What's up, man? I was in
the area, figured I'd tell
you what I got in person.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.695
All right.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.366
So, uh, the storage unit,
leased out to this guy
named John Johnson.

31:08.825 --> 31:12.787
Previous address he listed
was 1956 Elvis Lane.
Graceland, Tennessee.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.164
I found no car registered
under his name.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.416
And the date of birth
he listed on the credit
check was bogus.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.252
Guy's a ghost, man.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.046
I appreciate you
looking into it.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.673
Man, I'm sorry, bro.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.634
I mean, if it was classified
as a crime scene there'd be
more I could do, but...

31:27.302 --> 31:28.803
No, I get it.
Thanks for coming by.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.471
Yeah. Take it easy.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.980
There it is again.
Second mention.

31:40.274 --> 31:41.649
Shredded newspaper.
So what?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.026
They call it a "trailer."

31:44.653 --> 31:46.862
Wait, yeah, I think I learned
about this at the Academy.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.824
It's a...
It's a way to
spread fire from

31:49.908 --> 31:53.202
wherever it starts to
other flammable materials
already there, right?

31:53.287 --> 31:54.829
Like plastic, or trash,
or whatever.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.581
Yeah. That way it
doesn't look like arson.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.208
DAWSON: Might explain
why the burn patterns
were in a different spot

31:59.293 --> 32:00.960
than when you saw
the squatters' fire.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.379
Possibly.

32:04.673 --> 32:05.798
I guess we're going back.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.594
BRETT: Traumatic amputation.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.722

the 130's and he is
high as a kite...

damn fingers at, lady?

32:15.767 --> 32:18.936

get litigious on your ass!

Better not be nobody
else's fingers in that bag.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.694
Can't fool me.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.696
I've seen the way you
do people around here.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.115
MAN: I'm watching you.
All of you. Like a hawk.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.950
All right, I got to know.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.954
Guy's sitting on the
floor with garden shears
when we get there.

32:37.039 --> 32:38.456
Only one left is his pinky.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.877
Says, "She loves me,
bitch loves me not."

32:43.670 --> 32:44.879
Cuts the sucker right off.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.839
How romantic.
Ah.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.799

WOMAN: Get her into two.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.561
That's the woman
from the domestic.

Uh, pretty sure.

Hey. 3331 West 17th?
Yeah, how'd you guess?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.240
Was her husband there?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.575
They're married?

33:16.078 --> 33:18.037

real broken up about it.

I'll be right back.

33:34.596 --> 33:35.846
What are you going to do?

33:35.931 --> 33:37.848
I just forgot the portable
oxygen tank in there.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.392
Be right back.
I'm gonna grab it.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.457

out of my house right now

34:03.542 --> 34:05.418
or I'll have the
cops here so fast it'll...

34:06.628 --> 34:07.712
Come on.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.839

You like hitting women?

34:09.923 --> 34:11.048
All right, all right,
all right!

34:11.633 --> 34:15.177
You ever hurt her again,
and I'll come back here
and kill you.

You hear me?
Mmm-hmm.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.982
Can I talk to you?
Yeah, sure.

34:32.863 --> 34:35.614
Portable oxygen tank's
right here.
Yeah, it is.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.991
Been here all day.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.160
It was an honest mistake.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.746
Really?
Yes.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.914
You want to BS the
paperwork, that's one thing.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.208
But don't lie to
your partner. Ever.

34:46.501 --> 34:50.045
And if this is some
kind of PTSD rage thing
over what happened with Lullo,

34:50.172 --> 34:52.089
then go see somebody,
like Boden said.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.674
Because these things
get worse.

I see.
I appreciate the call.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.705
Chaplain Orlovsky regained
consciousness this morning.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.457
Odds are he's gonna
make a full recovery.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.209
Thank God.
That's so great.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.335

I hear that right,
Lieutenant?

Chaplain's gonna
pull through?

35:32.631 --> 35:33.839
Yeah, he is.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.801
What'd I tell you?
Junkyard dog.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.302
Give him my love
when you see him.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.512
All Right.
I'm heading there right now.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.472
Oh, hang on a sec,
if that's the case.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.185
I ordered extra hoping
this moment would come.

35:46.269 --> 35:51.023
You tell Padre that when
he's back on his feet again,
the Wicker Park Wolverines

35:51.107 --> 35:53.818
could use an assistant coach
who actually knows
something about hockey.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.611
Oh!
Hey.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.656
Now, Cruz may not
know anything about
hockey, but me...

35:58.740 --> 36:02.451
But do you guys have any idea
who Chaplain Orlovsky
actually grew up playing with?

36:03.036 --> 36:04.078
No, who?

36:05.872 --> 36:08.457
Hey, today is the
first practice, right?

36:08.542 --> 36:10.209
Yeah.
Well, it's not
exactly a practice.

36:10.377 --> 36:14.296
It's more of a...
What do you call it?
A team building summit.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.174
Got an idea for you.

36:23.265 --> 36:26.308

too, Chaplain.

sends her love.

Ah. How's she doing?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.784
She's gonna make
a great firefighter.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.370
Yeah,
I figured she would.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.830
Yeah, me too.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.417
Well, I was so relieved
to hear that the driver
of the other car was okay.

Uh, young woman.
Evelyn, right?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.004
Yeah, that's right.

36:55.088 --> 36:57.047
God must have been
looking out for both of us

36:57.132 --> 36:59.592
to have you be the one
to respond to the call.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.892
Oh, and, uh, this is
from Christopher Herrmann.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.353
Something about
being an assistant coach.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.233
Coach?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.445
Tell him I accept
the challenge.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.655
I will.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.658
You take care
of yourself.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.161
You, too.
All right.

37:29.748 --> 37:35.085
Oh, and, uh, I heard
that you and Bobby Hull
came up together,

37:35.170 --> 37:38.005
and you turned down an
offer from the Blackhawks
to become ordained.

37:38.506 --> 37:39.632
Herrmann tell you that?

37:39.966 --> 37:42.801
Yeah. Is it true?

37:52.729 --> 37:54.980
This is the year,
my small friends,

37:55.065 --> 37:57.316
that the Wicker Park
Wolverines

37:57.400 --> 38:00.277
are going to barnstorm their
way into the history books.

ALL: Me!

coming home with the Pee Wee

some blood on the ice trying!

who's with me?
ALL: Me!

the path to victory
is paved with two things,

38:22.008 --> 38:23.926
sacrifice and teamwork.

38:24.010 --> 38:27.513
And that is what
we're doing here today!

38:27.681 --> 38:28.889
Now, who's with me?

38:28.974 --> 38:30.015
ALL: Me!

38:30.100 --> 38:33.060
All right, come on up,
get up here, and get
some paintbrushes!

38:33.144 --> 38:34.311
Get on those walls!

38:34.396 --> 38:35.396
Everybody!

38:35.480 --> 38:41.777
Wolverines! Wolverines!
Wolverines! Wolverines!

38:41.861 --> 38:43.862

39:01.339 --> 39:02.339
(SIGHS)

39:08.221 --> 39:09.555
(CHUCKLING)

39:31.453 --> 39:33.245
There you go.

39:34.581 --> 39:35.956
Hey.
Hey.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.251
How you doing there, Pop?

39:39.461 --> 39:41.128
I'm doing just great, son.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.755
How is he?

39:42.839 --> 39:45.966
Oh, he is perfect.

39:47.844 --> 39:50.471
Yeah. Dad,

39:51.765 --> 39:53.640
thanks for being here.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.768
I just wanted to give
Donna a little break.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.604
I'm not quite sure
if I succeeded in that.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.204
The trailer would have carried
the flames from over there

40:16.122 --> 40:17.831
to the propane
tanks right here.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.003
It's just hard to
tell what's what.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.506
Everything's
so badly burned.

40:26.508 --> 40:28.592
Well, forget about looking
for shredded newspaper.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.678
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

40:33.306 --> 40:36.183
I don't know.
Something else.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.650
Dawson! Come here.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.947
DAWSON: What is it?

41:37.203 --> 41:38.203
You see this?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.123
See that staple?

41:41.916 --> 41:42.958
Matchbook?

41:43.042 --> 41:46.003
Yeah. Bailing wire would
have been used to hold a
cigarette in place.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.380
Which would then burn
down slowly until it
lit all the matches.

41:48.798 --> 41:50.382
Like a slow burning fuse.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.717
Yeah.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.430
Oh, my God.
You were right.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.390
This was arson.

41:58.474 --> 42:00.017
Which would mean
that Shay was murdered.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.768
And whoever did it
is still out there.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.283
