WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:05.003
<i>Peacocks
We're marching down the field</i>

00:05.173 --> 00:08.324
<i>Peacocks
And we refuse to yield</i>

00:08.493 --> 00:11.530
<i>No one's tougher
'Cause we are rougher</i>

00:11.693 --> 00:15.481
<i>We are the Peacocks of ULA</i>

00:18.973 --> 00:21.965
See, now that's exactly why people
be pushing you down the steps.

00:22.693 --> 00:25.844
For your information,
I've done the peacock strut...

00:26.013 --> 00:29.369
...exactly nine minutes before
each game and we've won every time.

00:29.573 --> 00:32.963
If we beat SCU tomorrow,
ULA will be the division champs.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.122
Like you care.

00:34.573 --> 00:37.963
You see, now that's where
you're wrong, my little pet peeve.

00:38.173 --> 00:41.290
I hope that ULA whoops
their butts tomorrow.

00:41.453 --> 00:45.082
So the fighting peacock within you
has finally emerged.

00:45.253 --> 00:49.087
Oh, yes, sir, he came out to bet
$500 on the game.

00:49.293 --> 00:51.568
How you disappoint me.

00:51.733 --> 00:54.201
Well, time to open.

00:54.373 --> 00:56.887
Let's put on our helpful faces.

01:02.973 --> 01:04.884
Oh, my God.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.373 --> 01:17.125
Who would do such a thing?

01:18.573 --> 01:21.167
Guess we can rule out Notre Dame.

02:31.453 --> 02:34.684
Thanks, Birdman, you're the
best mascot this school ever had.

02:34.853 --> 02:36.206
Thank you.

02:38.773 --> 02:41.412
Hey, Carlton, what was Coach Kelly
talking to you about?

02:41.573 --> 02:45.088
Oh, he likes to consult with me
before making important game decisions.

02:45.253 --> 02:48.802
So, what's it gonna be,
regular or grape-flavored Gatorade?

02:49.173 --> 02:52.370
You can crack wise, Will,
but I'm an important part of this team.

02:52.533 --> 02:54.683
None of those guys
will leave the locker room...

02:54.853 --> 02:56.411
...before they rub me for luck.

02:56.573 --> 02:58.882
Sure they not just rubbing you
for fun, baby?

02:59.933 --> 03:02.242
Rub this, Will.

03:04.253 --> 03:06.687
- Yo, Jazz, what's up, man?
- What's up, man?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.411
Hey, did your bookie
take my bet?

03:08.613 --> 03:12.083
You down. Five C's on ULA.

03:12.893 --> 03:13.882
You are the man.

03:14.053 --> 03:17.250
Who else could have found out that
the Mustangs' starting quarterback...

03:17.413 --> 03:18.812
...has come down with the flu?

03:18.973 --> 03:21.407
It pays to have friends
at the urology lab.

03:22.653 --> 03:25.372
You know, it might serve them
SCU punks right.

03:25.533 --> 03:28.570
Messing up the Peacock.
I've been cleaning this place up all day.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.126
You know, you're getting soft.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.124
The Will Smith I know
wouldn't get mad.

03:32.293 --> 03:34.170
He'd get even.

03:36.053 --> 03:38.009
You know what, Jazz?

03:38.173 --> 03:40.733
Tonight, you and I
will acquire a vehicle...

03:40.893 --> 03:43.202
...and we're going to acquire
the SCU statue.

03:43.693 --> 03:45.331
Swipe Mikey the Mustang?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.848
Now, why would I steal something
I can't sell?

03:50.013 --> 03:53.722
Well, the Jazz I know didn't need
a reason to do something stupid.

03:55.293 --> 03:57.932
You're right, Will.
What was I thinking?

03:58.293 --> 03:59.567
Here's what we're gonna do.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.012
Daddy.

04:03.453 --> 04:07.765
Daddy, there's a man under my bed
and I didn't tell him to hide there.

04:08.253 --> 04:10.209
Sweetheart,
he's from the security company.

04:10.373 --> 04:12.329
I'm thinking of upgrading
our alarm system.

04:12.493 --> 04:14.688
Hilary, there was a robbery
in our neighborhood.

04:14.853 --> 04:18.163
Someone cleaned out the entire
east wing of the Spelling mansion.

04:18.333 --> 04:22.246
How are they going
to fence all that crushed velvet?

04:23.013 --> 04:25.925
Here they are, family.
Three tickets to the big game.

04:26.093 --> 04:28.891
See what happens
when your son's a mascot?

04:29.093 --> 04:30.970
They're right on the 50-yard line.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.089
Won't we be in the way?

04:34.293 --> 04:38.286
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go check my head for molt.

04:39.813 --> 04:43.044
You know, Will, it wouldn't hurt
if you did something for your school.

04:43.213 --> 04:46.967
Oh, I know, and I am, Uncle Phil.
Tonight, I'm stealing the SCU statue.

04:47.133 --> 04:49.044
Don't even joke
about something like that.

04:49.213 --> 04:51.124
I was just kidding, Uncle Phil.

04:52.053 --> 04:54.169
But, well, hey,
can I borrow the station wagon?

04:54.333 --> 04:57.325
You know, got me kind
of a big date tonight, you know?

04:57.493 --> 04:59.245
Yeah.

04:59.413 --> 05:02.007
- Sure, here you are, son.
- Thank you, thank you.

05:02.813 --> 05:07.250
You know, Will, illegal transportation
of a school statue is a felony.

05:08.013 --> 05:10.288
Yes, sir, thank you.

05:10.493 --> 05:14.202
All right, here's the situation,
unless you fortify your security system...

05:14.373 --> 05:17.843
...my guess is within six months
you'll all be dead.

05:19.013 --> 05:20.765
That's a little extreme, isn't it?

05:20.933 --> 05:24.403
Extreme? Let me tell you about
some of the things I've seen, Mr. Banks.

05:24.573 --> 05:27.007
Homes overrun by thugs and gangs...

05:27.173 --> 05:30.961
...priceless possessions lost forever
to ruthless looters.

05:31.133 --> 05:36.651
Mangled bodies of innocent people
slaughtered like lambs.

05:36.813 --> 05:38.292
God, where was this?

05:38.453 --> 05:40.842
"Mortal Kombat" by Sega.

05:42.853 --> 05:46.368
- All right, what do you recommend?
- This little baby right here.

05:46.573 --> 05:49.531
Oh, come on,
this is a bit much, isn't it?

05:49.693 --> 05:52.161
I mean, Russia has fallen.

05:53.493 --> 05:58.009
Fine, if you don't care about the safety
of your lovely young daughters.

05:58.173 --> 06:02.451
All right, all right, all right.
We'll take the ultimate security package.

06:03.973 --> 06:05.691
Move in.

06:13.933 --> 06:15.446
Okay, check it out, check it out.

06:15.613 --> 06:17.569
So we had Mikey the Mustang here...

06:17.733 --> 06:20.372
...wrapped up in blankets
in the back of the Volvo, right?

06:20.573 --> 06:23.804
So we about to jet off campus.
All of a sudden:

06:24.373 --> 06:27.251
It's like, "Oh, five-0!"
Right, yo, we knew we was busted.

06:27.413 --> 06:30.769
Man, I saw my whole record
flash before my eyes.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.125
Yeah, I had to think fast, right?

06:33.293 --> 06:36.171
So I put on this real sincere face...

06:36.333 --> 06:40.326
...before I knew it I had this cop
convinced I was Sidney Poitier's son.

06:40.773 --> 06:42.570
Who's the man? Who is the man?
It's me.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.805
Y'all ain't gotta say nothing, go on.
Get on fools.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.929
Well, I got to go get me a new jacket.

06:48.093 --> 06:50.323
If you need me,
I'll be in the lost and found.

06:54.253 --> 06:57.723
Hey, what's that bucking Mustang
doing here?

06:57.893 --> 07:01.681
Just a little payback to them SCU fools
for that stunt they pulled yesterday.

07:01.853 --> 07:03.844
And you said
I didn't have no school spirit.

07:04.013 --> 07:05.571
You must return it.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.289
Carlton, we're just having
a little fun, man.

07:10.453 --> 07:12.444
I know how much
you hate that, baby.

07:12.653 --> 07:15.850
Don't you understand?
SCU is going to retaliate.

07:16.053 --> 07:19.887
I mean, you've practically given them
an invitation to abscond with Percival.

07:21.013 --> 07:22.651
Who?

07:22.813 --> 07:25.532
Hello?

07:28.053 --> 07:30.044
Percival, our beloved peacock.

07:30.253 --> 07:33.086
Look, I'm holding you
personally responsible for its safety.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.244
Don't take your eyes off of him.

07:35.453 --> 07:40.243
Oh, but, Carlton, no.
That means I'll miss the big pep rally.

07:40.413 --> 07:43.803
Well, I'm sorry, Will, don't do
the crime if you can't do the time.

07:43.973 --> 07:45.247
Now, if you'll excuse me...

07:45.413 --> 07:47.643
...I have 4000 fans
waiting for me in the quad.

07:47.813 --> 07:49.644
Hand me my head.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.563
I'd love to.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.809
It's show time.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.930
Come on, girls,
Carlton's rally starts in 45 minutes.

08:04.253 --> 08:07.131
I'm sorry I overslept.
It took me forever to get to sleep.

08:07.293 --> 08:09.761
That guard dog was barking all night.

08:09.933 --> 08:13.642
Can't he be like other dogs
and quietly lick himself?

08:15.053 --> 08:17.851
Look, I got this system
so that we'd all feel safe.

08:18.013 --> 08:22.325
Now, I just press in our code
and we're off.

08:22.493 --> 08:28.807
<i>Fifty seconds to activation.
Please exit the premises.</i>

08:31.773 --> 08:34.731
- Maybe he wants a bone.
- Yeah, one of ours.

08:34.893 --> 08:37.123
No, wait a minute.
What is the release command?

08:37.293 --> 08:42.082
It's something German.
Strudel, schnitzel...

08:43.573 --> 08:45.723
Mercedes.

08:47.373 --> 08:50.968
- Let's try the front door.
- Good idea. Come on.

08:51.133 --> 08:56.002
<i>Twenty seconds to activation.
Please exit the premises.</i>

09:01.373 --> 09:03.329
He's a quick little sucker, isn't he?

09:03.533 --> 09:06.252
- Maybe you should shut off the alarm.
- Good idea.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.641
Let me see, our code.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.202
<i>- Ten seconds to activation.
- Code is seven something.</i>

09:10.373 --> 09:11.886
<i>Switching to final countdown.</i>

09:12.053 --> 09:16.331
<i>- Ten, nine, eight, seven...
- It is... Okay, okay, 508...</i>

09:16.493 --> 09:19.485
<i>...six, five, four...
- No, no...</i>

09:19.653 --> 09:23.202
<i>...three, two, one.
- Do you mind, please?</i>

09:23.373 --> 09:26.445
<i>Activating security system.</i>

09:44.253 --> 09:48.212
- Daddy?
- I'll call the security company.

09:48.373 --> 09:50.603
Just stand still. Be still.

09:50.773 --> 09:53.526
It's okay. It's okay.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.651
Just gonna call...

09:58.333 --> 10:03.202
<i>Intruder, stay where you are.
There is no escape.</i>

10:04.173 --> 10:05.401
Well, at least we're safe.

10:05.973 --> 10:10.171
<i>Five seconds
to automated armed response.</i>

10:16.413 --> 10:17.926
What happened to Carlton?

10:18.613 --> 10:22.288
I think my Aunt Helen dropped him
on his head when he was a baby.

10:22.933 --> 10:24.969
No, I mean, he's late for the rally.

10:25.133 --> 10:28.170
He usually shows up early
to help me with the team seating chart.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.164
He left here about an hour ago.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.164
Well, he never showed.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.722
I got a feeling in my gut
something happened to him.

10:34.893 --> 10:36.645
I just know it has.

10:36.813 --> 10:38.041
Look, coach, trust me...

10:38.213 --> 10:41.171
...Carlton wouldn't miss that game
for all the cheese in Philly.

10:41.333 --> 10:45.611
- He'll be there or my name ain't...
- Will!

10:45.813 --> 10:48.407
<i>Is this the end of our plucky mascot?</i>

10:48.573 --> 10:52.122
<i>Does this spell doom
for the Fighting Peacock football team?</i>

10:52.293 --> 10:57.925
<i>Stay tuned, same Fresh Prince time,
same Fresh Prince channel.</i>

11:10.653 --> 11:12.006
It could be worse.

11:12.173 --> 11:15.643
I mean, he could have been dipped
in 11 herbs and spices.

11:18.133 --> 11:21.125
It's 90 minutes before game time.
Any sign of Carlton?

11:22.493 --> 11:25.724
Well, actually, there is a sign.

11:27.893 --> 11:31.090
That's it. Game over. We're dead.

11:32.093 --> 11:34.607
He's not exactly Vince Lombardi.

11:34.973 --> 11:37.771
This is how my career
is gonna end, huh?

11:37.933 --> 11:40.527
Well, at least I still have my health.

11:40.693 --> 11:43.571
What's that lumpy thing
on the back of your neck?

11:48.333 --> 11:51.609
Listen, listen, coach. Coach, listen.

11:52.133 --> 11:55.682
You're sweating it over nothing.
The game is a lock.

11:55.853 --> 11:58.162
We found out that
the SCU starting quarterback...

11:58.373 --> 11:59.965
...came down with the Canadian flu.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.203
The Canadian flu?
What the hell is that?

12:03.053 --> 12:07.444
I guess it's just like the American flu,
just colder.

12:08.093 --> 12:09.321
Hogwash.

12:09.493 --> 12:12.007
Every year SCU tries to put out
some bogus rumor...

12:12.173 --> 12:13.731
...about one of its star players.

12:13.893 --> 12:17.772
Mess up our game plan.
Last year, their kicker had rickets.

12:21.973 --> 12:24.282
Jazz, you fed me a bad tip, man.

12:24.453 --> 12:27.331
I might owe your bookie $500
that I don't have.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.969
Tony the Shovel
ain't gonna like that.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.772
Just ask Flat Nose Gary.

12:33.133 --> 12:35.363
The Birdman
is our team's lucky charm.

12:35.533 --> 12:37.808
Without him, our players
won't think they can win.

12:37.973 --> 12:41.648
And, if they don't have it here,
they ain't gonna to have it here.

12:44.533 --> 12:48.731
And if they don't have it here,
you gonna get it there.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.570
Jazz, Jazz, come here, come here.
I know where this is.

12:56.773 --> 13:01.051
This is the rumpus room
of the Kappa Omega Psi sorority.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.891
How you know that?

13:03.053 --> 13:06.682
Well, I got me a little rumpus
in that room the other night, you know.

13:07.213 --> 13:09.090
Hey, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

13:09.253 --> 13:11.483
- I can't go there, man.
- Why not?

13:12.333 --> 13:15.131
Restraining order. It's a long story.

13:17.813 --> 13:20.043
Thanks, but we'll just stick
with our old system.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.169
You're making
a big mistake, Mr. Banks.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.449
Well, we've got everything.
Except for the dog.

13:24.653 --> 13:26.928
He seems to have
chewed his way through the fence.

13:27.093 --> 13:30.290
- What will we do if he comes back?
- Yeah, isn't he kind of dangerous?

13:30.453 --> 13:32.045
Only if he hasn't eaten.

13:34.573 --> 13:38.043
I don't know, maybe we should have
given the new system a little more time.

13:38.213 --> 13:41.171
Now, we live in a dangerous world
and we should take precautions.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.245
But turning our home into a bunker
isn't the answer.

13:44.453 --> 13:47.047
You're right. Let's just get guns.

13:47.213 --> 13:49.249
You're missing the whole point,
sweetheart.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.966
We are lucky enough
to live in an area...

13:51.133 --> 13:53.408
...where we don't have to be obsessed
with safety.

13:53.573 --> 13:55.848
We missed Carlton's rally.
Let's not miss the big game, okay?

13:56.053 --> 13:57.725
- Okay.
- Come on.

13:57.893 --> 14:00.612
- I'm so excited. It's gonna be...
- I know.

14:01.773 --> 14:03.331
Is that...?

14:03.493 --> 14:07.884
My God!
Somebody stole my Mercedes.

14:14.733 --> 14:18.282
You know, you are way too nice
to be locked up in a cage.

14:18.493 --> 14:21.849
- Does that mean you'll let me out?
- No.

14:22.013 --> 14:25.289
But you're awfully cute
when you grasp at false hope.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.567
Look, I know you might find this
hard to believe...

14:38.733 --> 14:41.930
...but in high school, I was sort of a...

14:42.333 --> 14:43.686
Dweeb?

14:43.853 --> 14:47.402
Well, I was going to say loner,
but that too.

14:47.573 --> 14:50.326
Now, for the first time,
I'm actually part of a team.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.046
Don't do this to me.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.322
That was so moving.

14:56.093 --> 14:59.244
Well, I'm late for the game. Bye.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.161
Amanda!

15:03.573 --> 15:05.291
Never mind.

15:07.613 --> 15:10.844
- Will, I'm so glad you're here.
- Shut up.

15:11.013 --> 15:14.289
- Yeah, I knew you'd make it.
- Shut up.

15:14.453 --> 15:17.331
- Come on.
- Damn.

15:17.533 --> 15:21.924
Look, Will, I'm desperate.
Take off your pants.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.921
I think you're taking this jail thing
just a little too far, buddy.

15:29.093 --> 15:32.927
Look, it's almost game time.
You're gonna have to go in my place.

15:33.133 --> 15:36.409
If you think I'm putting on that
stupid suit, you're out of your mind.

15:36.573 --> 15:39.133
Well, if you don't,
you're out 500 bucks.

15:42.173 --> 15:44.289
Unzip me, please.

15:47.893 --> 15:50.885
Gets a little funky in there too, huh?

15:52.333 --> 15:56.292
Men, I know this is the first time
we've been behind at the half.

15:56.493 --> 15:58.324
But all we need
is four quick touchdowns.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.125
We'll be right back in this thing.

16:04.013 --> 16:07.722
- He's here.
- Yeah!

16:07.893 --> 16:11.522
Hey, it looks bad, Carlton, but now
that you're here, we got a chance.

16:11.693 --> 16:15.049
Do the peacock strut.
On your feet, boys.

16:15.213 --> 16:18.364
<i>Peacocks
We're marching down the field</i>

16:18.573 --> 16:21.531
<i>Peacocks
And we refuse to yield</i>

16:21.693 --> 16:24.161
<i>No one's tougher
'Cause we are rougher</i>

16:24.333 --> 16:28.121
<i>We are the Peacocks of ULA</i>

16:28.293 --> 16:31.649
<i>Peacocks
We're marching down the field</i>

16:31.813 --> 16:33.166
<i>Peacocks
And we...</i>

16:33.333 --> 16:37.167
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey!

16:37.613 --> 16:41.162
What the hell are you doing?
That's not the peacock strut.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.369
This is the peacock strut.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.809
<i>Peacocks
We're marching down the field</i>

16:47.013 --> 16:48.810
<i>Peacocks
And we...</i>

16:49.013 --> 16:50.651
What?
They rough you up or something?

16:52.053 --> 16:55.489
Those animals. Well, at least
you're here, and that's all that counts.

16:55.653 --> 16:58.486
Okay, gather around boys,
it's time to rub the Birdman.

16:58.813 --> 17:02.362
- Yeah!
- Y'all ain't rubbing nothing over here.

17:02.653 --> 17:04.165
Hey! Hey!

17:04.333 --> 17:06.926
You. Where's Carlton?

17:07.093 --> 17:10.290
Hey, look, we tried to break him out,
man, but it wasn't happening.

17:11.772 --> 17:13.888
We're toast.

17:18.093 --> 17:21.801
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.282
Boo-hoo, our mascot ain't here.

17:25.693 --> 17:29.527
You big bunch of babies.

17:30.133 --> 17:34.092
What about your fans?
They got a lot riding on this game.

17:34.293 --> 17:38.286
Their hopes, their dreams.

17:38.853 --> 17:40.650
Their nose.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.722
Hey, listen, I'm gonna tell y'all one time,
and one time only.

17:44.893 --> 17:47.805
Mascots do not win football games.

17:47.973 --> 17:49.372
Players do.

17:50.613 --> 17:52.205
And coaches.

17:53.053 --> 17:57.251
Hey, you know what,
you gentlemen got a choice.

17:57.413 --> 18:03.045
You can give up and crawl away
like spineless, gutless losers...

18:03.213 --> 18:04.646
...or you can pull it together.

18:04.813 --> 18:09.170
Throw it down, pick it up, strap it on,
kick it's butt and go out as champions!

18:09.333 --> 18:10.561
Yeah!

18:10.733 --> 18:12.883
This is the biggest game
you will ever play.

18:13.053 --> 18:14.611
Yeah!

18:14.773 --> 18:17.003
Now, sure, some of you
may make it to the pros...

18:17.173 --> 18:20.449
...but, let's be honest, for most of you
this is the end of the line.

18:20.613 --> 18:22.444
Ye...!

18:22.653 --> 18:24.848
No more big games,
no more free rides.

18:25.013 --> 18:27.208
No more honeys acting
like you all that.

18:27.373 --> 18:30.649
Let's be honest, we don't even know
if half you all are gonna graduate.

18:30.813 --> 18:32.963
- Then, what you gonna do? Coach?
- Hey!

18:33.213 --> 18:37.206
That's right, you guys, it doesn't
matter what we do, we're losers.

18:38.973 --> 18:41.533
Wait a minute, I didn't...
That ain't, that ain't...

18:41.693 --> 18:45.083
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay, okay, here's an idea.

18:45.253 --> 18:47.972
Rub me, rub me, rub the bird.

18:48.133 --> 18:49.646
Rub, rub...

18:51.613 --> 18:53.524
Hey, Carlton,
how'd you get out, man?

18:53.693 --> 18:56.969
I escaped while the housekeeper
was changing the newspaper.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.931
Hey, fellas, I made it!

19:02.173 --> 19:03.367
What did you do to them?

19:03.533 --> 19:05.888
Listen... Listen, Carlton,
that is not important.

19:06.053 --> 19:08.442
The most important thing
is that you get out right there...

19:08.613 --> 19:11.286
...and you strut
like you've never strat.

19:14.293 --> 19:18.844
<i>Peacocks
We're something something field</i>

19:19.013 --> 19:22.323
<i>Peacocks... pealed</i>

19:22.493 --> 19:23.926
<i>- No one's tougher
- Right, right.</i>

19:24.093 --> 19:25.526
<i>'Cause we are rougher</i>

19:25.693 --> 19:29.572
<i>- We are the Peacocks of ULA
- Come on, come on, come on.</i>

19:29.773 --> 19:30.967
<i>- Peacocks
- Yeah!</i>

19:31.173 --> 19:33.129
<i>We're marching down the field</i>

19:33.293 --> 19:36.251
<i>Peacocks
And we refuse to yield</i>

19:36.413 --> 19:39.211
<i>No one's tougher
'Cause we are rougher</i>

19:39.373 --> 19:43.491
<i>- We are the Peacocks of ULA
- One more time!</i>

19:46.973 --> 19:49.533
Man, this victory party is weak.

19:50.213 --> 19:52.773
That's because we lost, Jazz.

19:54.413 --> 19:58.088
And thanks to you, I'm gonna have
a date with Tony the Shovel.

19:58.253 --> 20:00.892
Well, I hoped you learned
your lesson about gambling.

20:04.813 --> 20:06.769
Okay, Jazz, check it out, check it out.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.247
Because you my homey, right?

20:08.413 --> 20:10.324
I'll give you a five minute head start...

20:10.493 --> 20:13.530
...before I chase you down
and drop kick your little coconut head.

20:13.693 --> 20:15.206
Fair enough.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.811
Hey, hey, hey.

20:21.973 --> 20:24.806
Come on, Carlton, cheer up, man,
we only lost by one point.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.770
You know,
that was a hell of a comeback.

20:26.933 --> 20:29.652
Man, you should be proud
as a peacock.

20:29.813 --> 20:33.328
We played a good game.
I'm just thinking about someone.

20:34.653 --> 20:37.213
- Amanda?
- Yeah.

20:37.373 --> 20:39.933
I'll probably never see her again.

20:42.133 --> 20:46.172
I'll bet you $500 you'll see her again.

20:47.293 --> 20:49.523
You're on, mister.

20:52.933 --> 20:53.968
Carlton?

21:02.093 --> 21:05.210
Amanda, does this mean
what I think it means?

21:05.373 --> 21:07.728
Yes, Carlton, I've come to gloat.

21:08.853 --> 21:11.890
We won. Well, bye.

21:12.093 --> 21:16.883
Wait a minute, that's it?
I thought we had something special.

21:17.053 --> 21:20.887
Dear Carlton,
it would never work between us.

21:21.093 --> 21:23.812
You're a Peacock, I'm a Mustang.

21:23.973 --> 21:27.090
Can you imagine
what our children would be like?

21:28.253 --> 21:31.689
What, powerful hind legs
with a colorful tail?

21:34.373 --> 21:36.443
Then I guess this is goodbye.

21:37.293 --> 21:39.284
Just until we graduate.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.244
I'll wait for you.

21:42.853 --> 21:45.003
And I'll cut back on dating.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.248
Hey, Carlton.

21:57.413 --> 21:59.449
Look, I know if two people
like each other...

21:59.613 --> 22:02.969
...it shouldn't matter where they go
to school, but the truth is it does.

22:03.133 --> 22:06.170
Alas, fate has conspired
to keep us apart.

22:06.973 --> 22:10.443
That's beautiful, man.
I just want my $500.

22:20.053 --> 22:22.647
He's a quick little sucker, isn't he?

22:29.053 --> 22:31.408
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:31.573 --> 22:33.325
Only for you. Give a little...
