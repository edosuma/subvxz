<i>Paul: At what point shall we expect
the approach of danger?</i>

03:30.920 --> 03:33.207
<i>Paul:
You know what I like?</i>

03:38.640 --> 03:41.450
<i>Alexander the Great,
Julius Caesar, Cleopatra,</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:46.571
<i>the Trojan Horse,
gladiators, chariot races,</i>

03:59.560 --> 04:01.005
<i>But then the Middles Ages...</i>

04:05.800 --> 04:08.371
Girl: And...
- Boy: ls this over the summer?

04:23.880 --> 04:25.769
<i>A blip of a disgusting mess.</i>

04:26.600 --> 04:28.364
<i>The Renaissance,
the beginning of the end,</i>

04:32.160 --> 04:34.322
<i>And American history,
what is that?</i>

04:35.200 --> 04:36.645
<i>I remember studying
in high school</i>

04:39.280 --> 04:42.409
<i>Praying for the Native Americans
to slaughter the Pilgrims,</i>

04:47.960 --> 04:52.648
<i>And then both World Wars
and, uh, and Korea and Vietnam</i>

04:58.520 --> 05:00.329
<i>Neither do I, neither do you.</i>

05:02.120 --> 05:03.360
<i>I'm not going.</i>

05:04.640 --> 05:05.641
<i>I'm not going.</i>

05:07.400 --> 05:08.765
<i>I'm not going.</i>

05:16.200 --> 05:17.247
I'm not going.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.681
Like going to France.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.365
Okay.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.126
In there.
- I know how.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.566
It's just...
- Here.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.691
You?
- Punished.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.087
Just don't want to be with these people.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.243
What's so funny?
- It's you.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.600
"These people."

06:34.680 --> 06:35.681
Let's cancel.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.729
I want you think about tonight
as a date with me.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.651
The two of us out on the town.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.324
You know Michael has a girl over.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.246
Is that a bad thing?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.889
She looks 25.
- She's 20

07:07.600 --> 07:08.681
What? What's bothering you?

07:11.560 --> 07:13.403
He just tells me everything.
- Not everything.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.440
Come on, let's go.
Get ready. I don't want to be late.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.844
At least, you know, online.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.841
Claire: Love you.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.601
Love you, too.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.765
I mean, I really do.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.848
It's pretty much unbearable.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.841
Man, into phone: No.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.364
I have the spreadsheet, yes.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.368
I know what he said.
I was there.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.528
Thank you.
- Congressman.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.802
What?

08:24.680 --> 08:25.761
No.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.485
Rick: <i>Is this really happening?</i>
- Michael: <i>It was so fucking tense.</i>

09:23.240 --> 09:26.449
Michael: Dad.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.402
Why?
- You know...

09:37.960 --> 09:39.086
The girl has a name, Dad.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.971
Okay, where's, uh, Jennifer, Michelle...

09:44.840 --> 09:47.446
Yeah, Anna. It's not like that.
We're just friends.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.129
You okay, Dad?
- Sure. Yeah.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.563
We'll be out of your way real soon.
- Anna: Okay.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.605
Are you a smoker, Anna?
- What? No.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.241
Good for you. That's...
Keep away from cigarettes.

10:28.200 --> 10:31.568
If you kids are hungry,
there's, uh, plenty of food in the fridge.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.121
Uh, I mean, we have a coffee machine,

10:42.600 --> 10:45.649
Mm. Yeah.
- That's it.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.481
Oh, here it is. For four?
- Mm-hmm.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.121
Mr. and Mrs. Lohman have not arrived.
- Oh, yes, we have.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.120
You want to see our driving license?

12:04.240 --> 12:05.241
Watch your step.
- Stan: Stay where you are, guys.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.330
That's it for tonight.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.690
All right, go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.088
I mean, seriously, boss.
- Okay.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.964
But I don't want to be disturbed
during dinner.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.362
Wait, hold on, Congressman.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.081
Mr. Speaker, before you say anything,
I want you to know

12:48.520 --> 12:52.320
Uh, chantenay carrots,
breakfast radishes,

13:00.680 --> 13:03.684
Uh, Oregon the state.
Oregonian rosemary.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.443
Mm, funny.
- Yeah. Timing.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.088
Oh, my God.
- There is a light dusting

13:35.800 --> 13:38.531
Um, here's the wine menu
for your selection.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.610
No. No, the campaign
is not slowing me down at all.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.971
Yeah, I just need tonight
to tally everything up.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.641
Stan: Yeah.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.211
Come on, Stan, we have to go.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.367
Her love...

14:08.400 --> 14:10.243
to you and Sabina.
Thanks.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.884
Jesus Christ.
- What?

14:16.720 --> 14:20.122
Do you know how much this bottle
of pink shit we just ordered costs?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.001
No, no, you can go.
You can go, thank you.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.284
Hello, Congressman.
Good to see you again.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.888
Hi.
- I'm so sorry that we're late.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.690
Paul insisted. We were early.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.887
Katelyn: It's been a hell of a day.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.410
You look good, Paul.
- Thanks.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.404
Not as good as my brother,

15:38.400 --> 15:42.564
And you are your usual gorgeous self,
Claire, it goes without saying.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.528
Very nice to see you.
Please, please.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.810
Sometimes it's very hard
to avoid people.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.249
Claire, Claire. Look at you.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.928
You can stop smiling now, Stan,
it's just us.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.161
Give it a rest, will you, Paul.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.161
This is long overdue.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.126
What were you talking about?

16:26.520 --> 16:27.885
<i>_</i> Weâ€œ
- We were just...

16:33.080 --> 16:34.889
Not talking about anything.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.731
We're gonna put it all on the table...

16:45.560 --> 16:47.562
Claire: Oh, something wrong?

17:09.720 --> 17:10.607
I'm not.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.566
Thank you, Antonio.
You're a real jewel.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.730
All right, a toast.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.089
To our beautiful wives.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.167
To health.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.648
Cheers.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.490
For the gentlemen, we have a potage
of butternut squash,

18:01.200 --> 18:04.921
The ladies are having
our young winter roots.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.764
That's the one.
- That's what you ordered?

18:27.560 --> 18:28.482
Really, it's beautiful.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.806
Please feel free to start in
on those appetizers.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.966
This is gorgeous.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.085
Terribly sorry.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.841
Always good for the nurse
to draw your blood,

18:55.560 --> 18:56.686
I don't know what you mean.

19:04.720 --> 19:05.846
Claire: Eating very good food.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.801
Excuse me.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.689
Just a second.
I'll be right back.

19:15.880 --> 19:16.722
You okay?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.050
Okay, how's it looking?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.489
We're 15 shy
and you need to flip them.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.246
Okay. Just, just dial.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.282
You're not yourself,
but what's up with Katelyn?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.362
Well, you've met my brother.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.366
All the time that I've known you,

20:01.880 --> 20:03.245
That's all you need to know.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.451
After tonight, it...
it'll all be over.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.161
I'd take a bullet for you,
you know that.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.446
Don't ever... Don't even talk like that.
I don't know why you just...

20:27.000 --> 20:28.525
This is my bullet.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.487
Dial.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.846
Please just dial.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.563
How are you doing tonight?
- Hey. Very well. Thank you.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.321
Can I get you anything else?

20:45.560 --> 20:48.325
Oh, God. I mean, I don't have enough
for all the way home.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.484
What about you, Beau?

20:51.840 --> 20:53.410
Wait, don't you have
your mom's credit card?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.129
Ah, no. I mean,
it maxed out last month so...

20:57.920 --> 20:59.684
And the month before.
- It was for emergency but...

21:05.240 --> 21:08.403
Yo, what about your dad's driver?
- Yeah, no, he's out of town.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.846
Anyway, Dad doesn't want us kids
being chauffeured around anyway.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.281
For the people?
- Okay, look, that's not funny.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.529
I'm sorry, Jesus.
I'm just kidding.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.531
I mean, everybody knows

21:34.800 --> 21:36.165
God, you guys-

21:37.080 --> 21:38.684
Come on, Beau, lighten up.

21:44.440 --> 21:48.490
Yo, that's pretty funny, huh?
Telling him to lighten up.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.683
Get it?
- You're an idiot.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.766
That's what's most important.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.322
Even if you can't handle your beer.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.128
Beau: That beer was bad.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.082
It's a shithole.
- Everything sucks tonight.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.844
It's just a small health club
but, you know,

22:40.600 --> 22:41.726
So, how's Beau?

22:42.440 --> 22:43.362
What do you mean?

22:45.600 --> 22:46.442
How's he doing?

22:46.760 --> 22:49.923
You know... Don't you mean
how are the kids?

22:51.000 --> 22:54.004
No.
I mean, how's Beau?

22:54.880 --> 22:57.451
And then, how's Val
and then how's Rick and...

23:07.640 --> 23:12.282
That's okay. It's okay.
So, how is Beau, you know?

23:12.960 --> 23:14.200
Same as always.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.565
I, I think that he's starting
to open up with me

23:25.000 --> 23:26.126
But, um,

23:27.640 --> 23:29.051
I have hope so...

23:30.360 --> 23:33.250
I mean, he's always been
Barbara's boy.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.886
Oh, he loves ya.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.529
Claire: ls Val still going
to that special school?

23:48.840 --> 23:51.605
I couldn't leave the kids there
in that filthy orphanage.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.887
God, his smile
just warmed my heart.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.530
You should've seen
the looks we got in the airport.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.241
YUP. YUP-
lt's okay, baby.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.125
Mommy.
- Okay, Val, it's okay, calm down, honey.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.402
She can be a bit much,
sometimes.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.686
She's done really well today.
- She's a good girl.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.801
Ah, it's a book.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.091
<i>Two of the most common were...</i>

24:40.320 --> 24:43.324
<i>He's researching Gettysburg.
- shot-and-ball by Colt and Remington.</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:55.040
You should think about adopting, Claire.
You know, Michael's alone.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.963
I don't... I don't think
I could ever love another child.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.569
I mean, not with everything
we went through with Michael, no.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.131
Mm-mm.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.810
I don't want to love another child.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.811
I wish I had your clarity.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.769
Does that make me a horrible person?
- No.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.608
It adds a lot of pressure,
you know.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.601
I can handle it.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.086
Pressure on Michael.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.884
Can't be healthy for him.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.489
Hey, oh. Hey.
Hey, buddy, what is it?

25:43.200 --> 25:46.044
Shh, it's okay. You're safe here, all right?
No one's gonna harm you.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.324
Rick! Michael!

25:48.880 --> 25:49.847
Get down here.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.323
What did you guys do to Beau?
- Nothing, Mom.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.927
Paul: How am I racist?

26:06.560 --> 26:08.130
You know, it's fascinating.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.091
You do realize you're accusing a child
of playing the race card.

26:18.920 --> 26:21.810
Exactly, it's just, it's...

26:25.720 --> 26:27.051
I get it, but I don't have to like it.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.442
I'm not a racist.
- You don't know him.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.848
Well, I'm not a racist.
At best, I'm...

27:06.280 --> 27:08.521
Do you think we should have given
Michael a brother or sister?

27:15.520 --> 27:18.126
Perfect-ish. Okay?

27:18.640 --> 27:20.927
And you can work on yourself.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.845
Who is the blind guy that said,

27:31.200 --> 27:32.770
No, "wonderful", yeah.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.771
Oh, man, now I'm gonna be up all night.
- Google it.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.683
That's cheating.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.769
It's got to be hard on Barb.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.641
A needy, self-centered, little shit.
- Well, he's hardly ever home.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.006
I don't mean Stan.
I mean, Beau, the kid.

28:15.480 --> 28:19.087
You know, running for public office.
Bullshit, Stan.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.489
Elitist, self-serving,
just like mother raised him.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.810
Stan is for Stanley.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.241
I teach public school.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.005
I give them money sometimes,
for, you know, whatever.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.129
And I'm... I'm not racist.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.401
My mother and Stan. Jesus.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.804
Well, it was, um,

29:24.600 --> 29:25.487
Like some trophy.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.685
Right there on the staircase.

29:29.840 --> 29:33.083
I was, like, 11 years old, and I...

29:35.640 --> 29:37.529
I said, "Get a room, you two."

29:38.560 --> 29:40.688
And she lost it. She just...

29:42.640 --> 29:43.846
What was his name?

29:45.320 --> 29:47.288
Press called him the "blind cowboy."

29:54.400 --> 29:55.925
Hey, stop.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.240
Stop.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.011
That was kind of outrageous
what you said to her.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.964
It was worth it, though.
It got her attention.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.251
Mm-hmm.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.244
But you weren't really unconscious,
were you?

30:20.480 --> 30:21.527
Mm.
- Mm.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.889
It was a beautiful moment.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.001
Oh.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.526
Thomas Gore.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.405
The blind senator.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.201
Fuck Google.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.445
Fuck Google.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.287
Mr. Lohman. Are we okay?

31:06.920 --> 31:08.604
Are we okay?
I don't know, Heinz.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.611
I don't know.
Do you have kids?

31:11.160 --> 31:14.209
No, I don't.
- Why not?

31:20.280 --> 31:23.762
I think it's more selfish to have kids
than to not have them.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.047
Yeah.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.765
Right?
- Yeah. Sure.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.604
We were duped into having kids

31:32.360 --> 31:33.805
by our genes

31:42.640 --> 31:44.290
That's what I think.
- Kinda dark.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.324
You chose well, Heinz.

31:51.080 --> 31:54.163
Who are the fuckers?
The... the kids?

31:55.640 --> 31:57.290
People who want you
to have kids?

32:03.200 --> 32:06.170
Would your genes like a cocktail
while you're here?

32:13.040 --> 32:15.281
Absolutely, no problem.
Coming right up.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.445
Yo, let's get some beer
before we get the cab.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.009
I'm tired.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.363
The door's busted.
- I mean, you only had, like, three.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.162
What happened?

32:39.400 --> 32:40.606
That was fucking quick.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.285
What's going on?
- There's somebody in there.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.644
Smells like shit.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.887
It's disgusting.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.002
Oh, shit.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.962
Is he dead?
- I think so.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.922
Paul...
- Turns out, hitting the head

33:10.280 --> 33:12.009
All right.
I guess it's just the three of us.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.560
That's probably better.
Thank you. Thanks.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.449
I can't be a father again.
I can't do it.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.647
You know, she's young.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.970
She uses it as a distraction,

33:45.840 --> 33:48.207
That's why I think it's good
she's talking to another woman about it.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.921
So sorry.
- Yeah.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.126
Okay.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.405
All right. Well, just check
and make sure these dates work.

34:10.679 --> 34:11.726
Oh, she's terrific.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.646
There's someone with a sense of
commitment, dedication. I'm serious.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.440
And for the record,

34:32.080 --> 34:34.208
I didn't even know those boys
were going to the party that night.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.766
Does Katelyn know?
- Yes, she knows.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.646
And I'm assuming that Claire
knows everything?

34:53.080 --> 34:55.047
I don't, uh... I don't get you,

35:04.720 --> 35:05.767
Nobody.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.481
Oh, my. Uh, well, my bad.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.921
Heinz, I thought we were friends.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.131
Stan: I'm so sorry.
- Heinz: Yeah, that's okay.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.801
He'll be back.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.489
<i>His first wife Barbara left him
to go live in an ashram in India.</i>

36:02.120 --> 36:03.121
<i>She lost it.</i>

36:04.040 --> 36:06.327
<i>You'd think it would make him
more humble, but no.</i>

36:14.560 --> 36:17.564
<i>Yeah, well, anyway, we haven't
heard from her in a while.</i>

36:19.000 --> 36:21.480
<i>The only reason I'm telling you this
is, uh, as a warning,</i>

36:23.200 --> 36:24.884
<i>Everyone falls for Stan.</i>

36:25.480 --> 36:27.528
Once <i>you fall for him,
I can't protect you.</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:28.967
<i>He's not my friend.</i>

36:29.600 --> 36:32.809
<i>Not even voting for him.
In fact, I'm not voting at all.</i>

36:33.240 --> 36:34.162
<i>Ever.</i>

36:40.680 --> 36:44.526
<i>See, history is either a lie or a bore.</i>

36:47.840 --> 36:49.285
<i>Now I have no one to talk to.</i>

36:50.720 --> 36:53.041
<i>Kids needs to be entertained
in order to learn,</i>

36:54.720 --> 36:55.721
<i>I was wrong.</i>

36:56.200 --> 36:59.124
<i>History can't compete
with video games, YouTube,</i>

36:59.560 --> 37:01.767
<i>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,</i>

37:04.960 --> 37:08.487
<i>Kik, Burn Note, Whisper,
Yik Yak, Skype,</i>

37:12.320 --> 37:13.367
<i>90m,</i>

37:20.040 --> 37:22.850
<i>You see, kids,
history can't compete.</i>

37:23.640 --> 37:24.926
<i>History is over.</i>

37:25.320 --> 37:27.846
<i>Everything is happening
in this second.</i>

37:49.000 --> 37:50.889
Paul: Hello.
- Dad?

38:16.640 --> 38:18.324
No, no, I need it now.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.001
It's okay.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.922
I'll just come and get it.
Don't worry about it.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.525
Hey, do you mind giving me
a ride someplace?

38:58.920 --> 39:01.161
Katelyn: Oh, Paul.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.610
I am a monster for keeping
your wife away.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.406
Yes, you are, Kate.
Yes, you are.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.123
You never complain, do you, Kate?

39:20.920 --> 39:22.570
I mean, honestly,
I've never seen anything like it.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.771
That's how my father raised me,
for better or worse.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.242
I don't have anything
to complain about.

39:35.880 --> 39:40.886
I mean, we all don't.
We're blessed.

39:47.320 --> 39:52.042
I just... just, I just want everyone
to be happy.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.564
Is that so outrageous?

39:56.920 --> 39:58.285
Of course not.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.564
I'll be in in a second.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.527
Beau: Hey, Beau here.
Tonight's okay.

40:20.440 --> 40:23.091
<i>Claire: Hi, love, it's Mom.
I'm on my way home.</i>

40:23.560 --> 40:25.210
<i>Dad and I are going out
to a restaurant</i>

40:26.960 --> 40:28.485
<i>Your father doesn't know
about tonight</i>

40:30.400 --> 40:32.084
<i>I'll check in with you around 10:00.</i>

40:32.840 --> 40:34.205
<i>Please don't stress.</i>

40:42.400 --> 40:43.606
Dad?

40:44.440 --> 40:46.044
Hey. Hey-hey.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.445
I thought I'd meet you outside.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.320
Were you just on my phone?

41:02.120 --> 41:03.281
I just was trying to call you.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.447
How were you trying to call me
on my own phone?

41:14.000 --> 41:15.411
Again.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.442
Rick: <i>You really think he's dead.
Michael: I guess...</i>

41:27.920 --> 41:30.571
<i>L don't know, that's really horrible.
- It's not horrible. Don't be scared.</i>

41:35.240 --> 41:38.323
Rick: <i>Come on.</i>

41:40.280 --> 41:42.009
Rick: Just do what Michael tells you.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.605
God. Jesus!

41:47.080 --> 41:48.445
Let's get out of here.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.000
Jesus.

42:01.320 --> 42:02.401
Come on.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.050
Get the fuck up.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.765
The guy's probably deranged.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.842
Oh, you're such a fuck...
- Beau, come on.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.085
Look.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.244
We still need the cab, jeez.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.405
Look at this, really a piece of shit.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.325
Hey! Why don't you get up?

42:26.960 --> 42:28.724
Hey, stink-o!

42:30.760 --> 42:32.205
Smells like rotten eggs.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.731
Probably got some
fucking food in there.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.606
Hey, mister. Get up!

42:39.400 --> 42:40.970
There's one of you
and there's two of us.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.726
Leave me alone.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.764
Oh, shit.
- What do you want?

42:49.480 --> 42:52.370
What are you waiting for?
Get out of here.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.249
Get out. Just fuck off.

43:13.280 --> 43:14.691
Woman: Get out of here.
- No, don't. Come on.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.288
Woman:
You don't know what the fuck...

43:32.800 --> 43:34.404
Leave me. You go and leave me alone.
- Holy shit.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.484
Garbage to garbage.
- You fucking shit.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.244
Oh, look.
- Oh, fuck.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.804
<i>Michael: You looked, didn't you?
- Paul: I did. I know. I saw.</i>

43:59.880 --> 44:03.248
This is getting weird

44:08.840 --> 44:10.330
It was just supposed to be a joke.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.086
You threw a burning match
at her as a joke?

44:13.960 --> 44:16.122
She shouldn't have been there.
I mean...

44:17.680 --> 44:19.967
The whole place stunk, Dad.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.771
She yelled at us.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.603
I mean, you would've done
the same exact thing.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.564
What did she do?

44:43.040 --> 44:44.883
Um, I...

44:46.000 --> 44:48.970
She's got to go. Get home and...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.321
Are you being serious?
- Hey, Michael Lohman,

45:05.920 --> 45:07.206
I can't tell.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.446
Time is what we need.
Time is on our side.

45:17.640 --> 45:18.971
We got lucky.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.084
You're gonna spin out, okay?
You just need to stop talking.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.090
Oh, okay.

45:34.960 --> 45:38.248
All I am saying is,
we'll get through this.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.448
You and me, right?
- Yeah.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.525
I didn't throw that ball.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.849
I got this.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.965
Paul: I'll pay for the damages.
Shop owner: He did it on purpose.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.401
Just tell me the truth.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.086
You have no idea what we're going
through right now, okay?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.689
He's sorry. He said as much.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.326
That ball is like
his best friend.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.324
Shit happens.
Things gets broken.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.161
You fucking kidding me?
- Goddamn it!

47:38.120 --> 47:39.406
I remember you.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.805
Because you killed her.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.409
I don't want to be with sick people.

48:04.480 --> 48:06.801
Uh, no, listen.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.450
Doctor: Oh, you're looking pretty today.
Are you expecting guests?

48:16.200 --> 48:17.281
Any minute.

48:17.840 --> 48:22.209
Is she going to die?
- What? No, no, I'm just saying...

48:38.000 --> 48:41.368
See how fast we can go.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.001
Okay, give me the phone.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.011
You got to get rid of that footage.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.720
She smokes?
You told me she didn't smoke.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.844
What? About Mom's cancer?
- No, about the ATM.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.284
Why the hell did you and Rick have to
post that goddamn stuff online?

49:23.160 --> 49:26.164
Are you listening to me?
- Jesus Christ. Yes. I am.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.807
You can't walk away from this.
That video will haunt you

49:42.360 --> 49:44.362
God!
Anna is gonna take me home

50:35.440 --> 50:37.283
Sweetheart,
what are you doing here?

50:38.920 --> 50:40.410
Dad stole my phone.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.966
How much do you know?

50:50.000 --> 50:51.490
How much do you know?

50:55.000 --> 50:56.650
Paul, maybe you should go inside.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.524
I'm not hungry and don't talk to me
like I'm a retard.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.487
Go.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.004
I thought you were on my side.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.928
You have to know
that first and foremost,

51:33.480 --> 51:35.130
I was afraid you wouldn't
be able to handle this.

51:45.320 --> 51:47.368
Honey, it really doesn't...
- Who? Stop calling me honey.

51:50.480 --> 51:51.606
Beau did it.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.642
He found it on Rick's computer,
the footage that they shot...

52:11.760 --> 52:12.966
It's only a few thousand.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.563
Michael called me
after it happened.

52:25.800 --> 52:26.961
They needed a ride home.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.361
Calm down.

52:35.120 --> 52:37.851
Do they know about
Beau and tonight?

52:53.320 --> 52:57.450
And I'm just, you know,
I'm just, it's, it's, I'm alone.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.524
No.
- I'm alone.

53:00.760 --> 53:01.807
You are his father.

53:11.280 --> 53:15.171
It's not Gettysburg.
Okay?

53:17.480 --> 53:18.641
Let's go in.

53:21.400 --> 53:22.447
It's cold.

53:25.480 --> 53:27.209
Paul:
...that wars are won or <i>lost</i>

53:34.160 --> 53:35.571
Uh, as it happened,

53:39.040 --> 53:42.487
Gettysburg was the beginning
of the end.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.602
Uh...

53:57.360 --> 54:00.921
May I please
have your fucking attention?

54:05.280 --> 54:07.044
Oh, there you are.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.241
Good.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.007
I'd like you to think
about something

54:22.080 --> 54:25.448
when you go home
to your miserable lives tonight.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.923
I want you to think about this.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.890
How many people

54:36.360 --> 54:38.761
do you think there would be
in this country

54:39.200 --> 54:40.770
without wars?

54:42.400 --> 54:45.529
Uh, I'm not saying
that the Civil War

54:57.000 --> 54:59.731
How many people would that leave
on our dying planet?

55:05.000 --> 55:09.767
I'm gonna go outside
and get a breath of fresh air.

55:10.800 --> 55:11.961
Do whatever you want.

55:13.520 --> 55:16.888
Just, uh,
clean up after yourselves,

55:17.120 --> 55:20.363
you sad, pathetic, doomed shitheads.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.041
Sit down, Klein.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.401
Thank you.
Okay, let's do some math. Uh...

55:34.680 --> 55:37.365
In a group of, say,
a hundred people,

55:40.640 --> 55:41.880
In an average group, say.

55:42.760 --> 55:45.047
I'm serious,
how many parents

55:51.880 --> 55:53.370
How many...

55:53.680 --> 55:57.401
How many constant whiners,
complainers,

55:57.760 --> 56:00.127
rapists, embezzlers,

56:01.960 --> 56:04.247
Dirty politicians, cheaters?

56:08.200 --> 56:09.884
Could be your mother,
could be your brother.

56:10.520 --> 56:12.841
Uh, you, for example.

56:16.040 --> 56:20.523
If some of your friends
were gone tomorrow?

56:27.240 --> 56:29.607
Gone. Dead. Buried.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.605
Their desks empty.
Show of hands.

56:34.920 --> 56:36.445
Come on, you don't
have to name names.

56:38.880 --> 56:42.009
Exactly.
Now a little closer to home.

56:44.200 --> 56:45.964
The uncle with shitty stories.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.081
The, uh, the molester.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.446
Oh, boy, you know about those.

56:53.480 --> 56:57.804
The, uh, the ugly cousin
who mistreats her dogs.

57:01.920 --> 57:05.811
Now think how happy
you and your loved ones would be

57:14.000 --> 57:16.480
Just like that.
Wiped off the face of the earth.

57:18.520 --> 57:20.170
Yeah, that's good.
Just like that.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.931
Just like that.
Just like that.

57:27.640 --> 57:31.850
You'd be happy, right?
You'd, uh, you'd be pleased.

57:34.560 --> 57:38.690
Because families are oppressive
and unloving and cruel.

57:39.520 --> 57:41.204
Okay now, stay with me.

57:41.480 --> 57:42.891
Now imagine...

57:43.920 --> 57:46.605
Because families are oppressive
and unloving and cruel.

58:52.920 --> 58:57.289
Claire: Nausea, constipation,
somnolence, dry mouth,

59:01.120 --> 59:02.804
Fast heartbeat, hypertension.

59:06.800 --> 59:08.404
Sexual dysfunction.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.005
B-But she said, she said
that she wasn't expecting

59:18.720 --> 59:19.881
Is that all?

59:46.280 --> 59:48.681
What about personality changes?

59:50.480 --> 59:52.403
That's not a side effect.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.650
That's the effect.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.966
Is that good?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.289
I guess we're here.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.925
Glad we're doing this.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.250
I wouldn't have suggested it
if I didn't want to do it, Paul.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.122
I thought the shrink suggested it.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.684
No, its okay.
I'm gonna turn it off.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.848
There's no shame
in getting help, Paul.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.924
There's help in getting shame?

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.004
Am I causing you shame?
- You're shaming my cause.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.880
Are you just gonna flip
every sentence I say. ls that it?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.486
Jesus.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.081
Susej.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.489
Susej.
You're good. You're good.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.766
You're good.
You're a Knucklehead, but you're good.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.486
Man, <i>on radio:... Pennsylvania Avenue
at the Walnut Street Bridge</i>

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.449
<i>The event is open to the public.
It will be held rain or shine.</i>

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.442
Come on.
Have you seen these?

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.364
You sure you want to go in?

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.126
Yeah.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.649
Recorded Male Tour Guide:
You are on hallowed ground.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.761
<i>The exact place where events changed
the course of American history.</i>

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.171
<i>Though it is the bloodiest place
in America,</i>

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.926
<i>If you let it,
this land will speak to you.</i>

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.166
<i>Now, let's go.</i>

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.209
Female <i>Guide:

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.640
<i>Well, I</i> wish <i>I</i> was in the <i>land</i> of cotton...

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.206

<i>He rests the rifle

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.247
He fires...

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.649
<i>Gettysburg begins.</i>

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.569
<i>From mid-morning
until mid-afternoon on July 1st,</i>

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.008
<i>Rebel reinforcements arrive
along the Harrisburg Road</i>

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.128
<i>And soon, the entire Federal position

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.563

<i>With the general riding 50 yards

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.531
<i>There is little protection
of this exposed flank.</i>

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.241
<i>Men take cover
as best as they can.</i>

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.962
<i>Paul: From the heights

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.162
<i>Paul: No, the Union troops surge back
pushing against the Rebels,</i>

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.441
This is too much,
I don't know. Sorry.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.165
Almost as many here
as the whole Vietnam war.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.323
What are you talking about?
Millions of people died in Vietnam.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.565
I don't see you crying.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.087
People express emotions
in different ways, Paul.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.729
Paul: You're saying I'm weak?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.482
I'm saying that you are who you are
and I accept that.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.803
We're different people,
so what? Big deal.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.966
I will always accept you.
Come on.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.171
What are you trying to say?

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.921
What are you saying?

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.607
We have had a history of mental illness
in this family for generations

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.007
It's time for us to actually
do something about it.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.126
We need to deal with it.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.089
What are you saying?
- I'm saying Mom was a wacko.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.122
We had each other.
It was you and me.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.201
You remember?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.923
And I always looked out for you.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.767
I still don't see you crying.
- Come on.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.569
You always thought
that I had it easier than you,

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.646
Someone had to be the adult in the house
and it wasn't going to be Mom.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.288
I didn't ask for the job, okay?

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.162
Yeah, I can see
you're all broken up about it.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.281
Fuck you.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.126
Don't be a baby.

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.682
FUCK you!

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.563
Ay-yi-yi-yi.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.810
Paul: It doesn't matter what we teach,
we learn nothing.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.801
I've done nothing with my life.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.849
He destroyed me.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.527
<i>Paul, he's a busy man.
He cares about you.</i>

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.720
<i>He's your brother.</i>

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.127
<i>You got to tell me
what's going on.</i>

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.366
I'm okay.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.048
I've been thinking
I'm not gonna write the book.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.728
It's time to un-know it.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.202
<i>Did you take your pills?</i>

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:11.520
Yes.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.367
How's Mike?

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.282
<i>Oh, he's good. He's good.
Do you want to talk to him?</i>

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.203
Stan: <i>Paul?</i>

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.648
Claire: <i>Paul.</i> are you there?

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.609
<i>Claire: Paul, please pick up the phone.</i>

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.928
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.723
Hey.
- God.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.366
What... Do you have a key?
- I'm gonna go get some ice.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.921
Paul. Paul.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.404
Please stop me if you've
heard this one before

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.401
Unless you ask me to.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.650
So, very quickly starting by region,

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.486
Hudson Flower.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.885
Um, so there you go.
Any questions.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.449
Discreetly, pointedly.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.647
And we're gonna do
something about it. Okay?

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.368
Me? What about you, Scarface?

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.325
You've always been against me?

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.928
This bill you've been working on.
What is it?

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.325
The Mental Health Parity Act,
MHPAA.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.362
It's about closing loopholes
in the Affordable Care Act.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.849
I don't know why you think
that attacking me

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.770
Wow.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.203
Sorry, Congressman,
I need you for a minute.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.081
Five minutes.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.603
Nobody else moves, okay?

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.649
<i>â™ª Hey, 'cause it's all
About the money a'</i>

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.887
â™ª Yeah â™ª

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.325
<i>â™ª 'Cause it's all
About the money I'</i>

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.004
<i>â™ª 'Cause it's all
About the money I'</i>

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.848
Oh, no, no.
- No, no, no...

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.011
Hey.
- Claire: Porn in the kitchen?

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.370
How are you?
- Good. Great. Fine.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.810
That's three different answers.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.445
Pick one. Any one.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.808
You would not believe the day I've had.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.490
Would you come
back to the table?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.086
No.
Everything's fine.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.682
You know, a house
divided against itself

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.523
What the fuck were those
fucking kids thinking?

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.611
They are good kids
and they took a wrong turn.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.929
Can we go home now?

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.765
We need to hear them out.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.403
Your brother,
he can be very practical.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.806
He's a deal-maker.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.969
Okay? So, don't antagonize him.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.725
And lay off Kate.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.050
Because we need them both.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.770
I don't want you to get sick again.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.128
But I'm... l'm perfectly fine.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.931
Don't leave me ever again.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.082
Please don't die.
- Stop talking like that.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.402
I'm right here.
- Should've closed that door.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.523
And Michael was just standing there.
- I know. I know.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:16.646
I know.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.445
Oh, boy.

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.886
Oh, shit.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.127
Stan: Hey.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.684
Hey, brother.
- Hey.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.646
What are you doing here?

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.685
We just went by to see Claire
and wish her luck tomorrow.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.808
Right. Thank you.
- You're gonna invite us in?

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.565
How are you doing, Paul?
- You should really have called first.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.044
I try to make every meal
a celebration.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.849
Barbara: How's he doing?
- He's doing okay. I'll go find him.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.091
Mikey!

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.369
Mikey, your uncle is here.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.806
And your aunt.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.402
Come by tomorrow,
you can eat it off the floor.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.283
Barbara: We just want to talk to your dad
for a second. Okay, babe?

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.444
Okay. Listen here, Paul.
We've been thinking.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.167
Go ahead.
- Thank you. You're an angel.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.731
Barbara and I think
it might be best for Michael

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.000
Paul, let's get a maid in here,
and get you back on your feet.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.168
Michael needs to start
going back to school.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.768
We understand
what you're going through.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.050
It could give you a little space,
you could relax, take care of yourself.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:47.441
He puts on a brave face,
but children need a stable home.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.926
Hey, listen.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.241
Listen, Paul.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.283
My son and I were about
to sit down to eat.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.967
Listen, we just thought
with the operation tomorrow and all,

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.527
Come on, man.
This is... This is insane.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:32.409
Come on. For Michael.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.366
Barbara: And for Claire.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.330
Please, Paul.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.649
I'll help you. I'll help you.
We'll all help you.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.243
He should be talking to someone,

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.324
His mother is ill.
He needs strength.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.607
He shouldn't feel that his father
can't deal with life anymore.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.482
You need to find your center.
- Yes.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.046
Do you know anything
about meditation?

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.842
Claire and I agreed to keep things
as normal as possible for Michael.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.484
Well, you should be with her
right now, okay?

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.251
Paul, Paul, listen to me.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.043
We already spoke to Claire.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.325
Barbara:
She agreed. It's all good.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.720
Whose idea was it?

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.483
But I will not let you steal my son.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.642
Don't worry about the food. Okay?
We can get him something else.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.321
<i>â™ª What I'm trying to say I'</i>

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.284
<i>â™ª I don't know why I'</i>

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.807
<i>XI drink all day I'</i>

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.449
Here we have our dessert course.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.009
Oh, but you must have it. It's beyond...
- I must?

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.289
Antonio: How is everything?
Having a great time.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.847
I hear there was a problem
with the dessert. I'm horrified.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.890
You know, the cork, the pin,
the dessert.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.524
Of course, we can leave you alone.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.124
You know,
I hope you understand that...

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.240
Believe me, he understands.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.889
He's so obsequiously effete
and sycophantic.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.324
Nina, could we have
some privacy, please?

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.564
Thank you.
Why don't we sit over here?

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.322
Katelyn, sit over there, please.
You two on the other side.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:52.083
Rick: <i>Dirty rotten shithole...</i>
- Michael: <i>Wanna do this?</i>

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.530
Michael: Hey, come on,
let's fucking do this. Let's do it.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.766
Rick:
Are we gonna fucking do this?

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.321
Here, bitch.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.646
Rick: Oh, shit.

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.886
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.367
Shit.
- Get something big.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.403
I got her right
in the fucking head, dude.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.326
Excuse me, could you please
kindly open the door?

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.403
Holy fuck.

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.044
Look what I found.
- Ooh, there you go.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.041
Don't scream all night, lady.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.086
Fucking stink-o.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.841
Get out of here.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.327
Rick: Let's go.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.681
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.966
Bullshit political spin on the wrong audience.
- Paul, Paul, Paul.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.562
Thank you.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.009
All right, I'm gonna try to explain.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.250
We had a call from his school.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.604
The most important thing for me
is my son, my son's future.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.009
I think it's possible

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.167
Maybe...

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.244
this case will never be solved.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.840
For the kids?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.407
<i>For us'?</i>

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.644
I don't see myself

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.888
living my life thinking that...

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.884
that my son was involved in a murder.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.571
Oh, wait, wait, wait a minute.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.647
I mean, this was an accident.
- It was, it was.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.128
That poor woman was savaged.
- Claire: Poor woman? Oh, come on, Stan.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.845
She was in their way, Stan.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.888
Michael said things
just got out of hand.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.003
These are good boys.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.843
We have to protect the boys now,
for what's done is done.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.164
We have to work out what to do next.
- Yes, yes. Exactly. Thank you.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.810
This is Rick and Michael's future
we're talking about.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.846
I don't think our boys can live
with this poison inside them.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:48.805
I spoke to Kate earlier, briefly,
this afternoon.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.646
Sure. Go ahead, go ahead.

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.166
You're on your own.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.206
I'm going to withdraw my candidacy.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.048
For the good of my son, my family,
Michael, you, all of us.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.641
You can't do that.
- Katelyn: Of course he can't.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.206
To save our children.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.365
You make a decision like this,

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.491
You have no right.
I won't let you.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:35.050
It's unthinkable, it's... it's terrible.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.367
But we have a responsibility as parents
to help them cope.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.968
You don't want to live with this, fine.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.685
But don't expose them.

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.769
She has no name!

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.922
No amount of money
is going to fix this...

01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:42.961
They...

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.085
They will serve their sentences.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.968
You do nothing.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.607
I won't forget.

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.565
It's not about you.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.609
The system will fail them.
We won't.

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.005
Believe me.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.647
I'm going to set
a press conference in DC

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.082
These boys have committed
a horrific crime.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.603
They'll have to pay for it.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.648
I suggest you do the same
with Michael.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.004
I'm gonna pay for this, and we'll...

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.046
get out of here.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.851
Are you just gonna sit there?
Say something.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.366
Our son.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:02.526
Not your son.

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.171
Our son.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.045
Rick: Holy fuck.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:34.727
Here, look.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.600
Come on, dude, let's go.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.242
Claire: I need to call Michael.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.003
Poor kid.
He's been alone all night.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.850
What do you think, Paul?

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.531
Me? What does it matter?

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.726
Not even Beau.
Certainly not Barbara. Not even you.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.048
Michael: Hello.
- Hi, sweetheart.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.569
He says we need to pay for it.

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.364
He's gonna turn us in.
I know. I mean...

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.966
It's just homework.

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.286
Everything always seems
more complicated than this.

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:05.567
He's fine.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.722
He's absolutely fine.

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.608
I don't know
what's taking him so long.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.087
I'll go find out.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.289
Beau changed his mind.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.410
We're right here for fuck's sake.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.403
I think...
- I told her what she needs to know. That's all.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.242
I'm really, I'm trying
to keep my mind open.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.689
Because I love those kids.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.047
And I love you.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.764
I didn't care every time
that you got a hard-on

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.202
Call the press conference
in the morning after...

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:00.846
Stan, listen to me.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.924
You're making someone else's
tragedy ours.

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.369
It's our tragedy.

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:18.041
Either way, it's ours,
it's everybody's.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.129
Call the press conference.
- Okay, boss.

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.529
"Okay, boss." You do realize
that this is everyone's life.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.448
Stan, listen to me.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.164
You will do more good as a governor

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.403
than you ever will
as a father or a husband.

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.368
You're nothing without politics.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.085
You need me

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.605
more than I need you.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.930
And those kids

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.409
need a parent.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.087
No. No. We're talking about

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.969
something here that is so extreme

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.251
and so awful.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.965
It's the right thing to do, Kate.
You know it is.

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.404
You know, sometimes,

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:16.727
sometimes the healing thing to do
is to leave the wound alone.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.805
Come on.

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.087
Give it a week. Hmm?
We'll talk about it. You and me.

01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:34.889
We'll talk and we will discuss things
and we'll make a decision, together.

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.969
What will he become

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.845
if he gets away with this?

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.728
He'll just be our son.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.930
Okay, well, give it a few days.
Hmm?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.126
Come on.

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.607
I'll give you three days.
Give you three days.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.402
Thank you.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.089
I told you I didn't want
to bring you into this.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.889
He doesn't listen to reason.
She has no power over him.

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:47.003
I can take care of him.
Okay?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.001
Can you do that?

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:53.121
You know what, um...

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.050
I don't feel so good.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.326
I mean, not for a long time.
Not for months.

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.242
I wanted to feel myself again.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.760
I know.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.245
When I do the laundry,

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.005
I find the pills you hide
and forget to throw away.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.048
That's why your
pants' pockets are pink.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:27.971
Why didn't you say anything?

01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.288
Because I wanted my Paul back.

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.203
Because you were numb
for a really long time.

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.889
Because I was very lonely.

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:49.926
Listen.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.441
I know that I let you down.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.530
I know that Michael doesn't think
I'm much of anything.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.524
That you're close.
That you...

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.604
It's just you two.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.370
That you keep things from me.

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.447
And you could prove it.
So I need you.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.482
I need you to be focused.
- Yeah.

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.407
Okay. Take care how?

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.006
Talk to him.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.050
Stan: Okay, check's paid.

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:43.762
Let's go.
- Come on.

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.085
Where are you...
Where are you going?

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.286
Katelyn: You don't know?

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.840
But, listen, I want to talk
about this press conference.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.570
For now.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.487
What do you mean?

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.290
Let's all go home, huh?

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.089
Heinz.
- Mr. Lohman.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.125
Well, it's been a pleasure
serving you and yours,

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.846
Huh. Yeah. Thank you.

01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.886
Oh.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.571
Good night.
- Thank you.

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.689
Nina: You're gonna give it three days?

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.327
Yeah, I owe her that much.
I owe my son...

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:03.247
much more than that.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.962
Family isn't politics, Stan.

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.162
It's all politics.
Don't be so naive.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.688
It's all strategic.

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.924
There's never a path
that's been just right or wrong.

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.685
Someone always gets hurt.

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.685
Like in politics, right?

01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:36.604
And every family that ever was.

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.645
Okay, so what happens now?

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.728
Some impossible happy ending?

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.366
I know.
Weird fucking fairy-tales, Stan.

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.008
All right.
Good night.

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:11.690
<i>Paul: War is always motivated
by a profound act of love.</i>

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:17.203
<i>To fight a war, you have to
deeply love the cause</i>

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.161
<i>You fight for who
and what you love.</i>

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.086
<i>Freedom, power,</i>

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.806
<i>I</i> love my family.
Open the goddamn door.

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.441
<i>I will go to war for my son.</i>

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.568
I just want to talk!
You <i>would</i> do the same.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.246
<i>You would do the same.</i>

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.842
Hey, open the door.

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.811
You don't have to hide
from me, Beau.

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.767
You know, we never really
got to know one another.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.362
You're kinda unknowable.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.002
If anything, I feel too much.

01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.246
You know?

01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.885
I just... You know, I see things
from a father's perspective, though.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:22.363
You know, what you're trying
to do, Beau, it's, uh...

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.443
Families work together
to bury the ugly stuff.

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.450
They don't...
Come on out, Beau.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.922
Families will do anything
to protect each other

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.451
Claire didn't.

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.169
It's our job to give Michael a future.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.647
You know, I used
to teach kids your age.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.849
I thought they loved me,

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.845
Scaring you straight
wouldn't work.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.286
I'm sorry, Beau.

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.886
Oh.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.361
Beau!

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.328
Is Beau up there with you?
- You can't Google reason.

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.209
Nothing.
- What did you do to him?

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.684
What did you do with him?

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.565
You are nothing to me.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.926
What did he do?
- Oh, boy.

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.371
Stan: Beau!
- Paul.

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.130
Paul: It's okay, honey, come here.

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:09.441
Hey, honey.

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.920
Stan: Beau!

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:24.727
Ohh!

01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:29.765
Oh, shit.
- We need to call Michael.

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.722
That many?
- What? What's going on?

01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:52.131
No, honey, how are you?
How are you doing?

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.367
Stan: Shut up.

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.968
Claire: You did good.
You did real good.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:19.842
Claire: I love you.

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.249
<i>â™ª Don't let the fuckers

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:39.328

<i>Good night.</i>

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:20.009
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
