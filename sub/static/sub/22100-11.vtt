It's a stretch, but it's the

could smell the scent,

stood exactly on the same spot

that we are right now.

41:48.882 --> 41:51.258
They experienced
dreadful losses.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.928
Their planet was a graveyard.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.973
They needed a home,

41:59.767 --> 42:02.769

ships and their guts.
