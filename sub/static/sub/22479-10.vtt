her last name.

Yes, but if we're going
to find her,

40:40.568 --> 40:44.398
we have to continue to
investigate her son -- Phillip.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.878
All they need now is a hint
of where Gwendolyn is,

Don't worry.
I have this.
I hope so.

you're right.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.870
We'll figure out what to do
after Stroh's in custody.
