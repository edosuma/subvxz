on you. You're blacklisted.

[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're burned,
you've got nothing--

00:10.544 --> 00:13.281
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.218

- Miami.

You do whatever work
comes your way.

- You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

- Should we shoot them?

who used to inform on you
to the F.B.I.--

Bunch of bitchy little girls.

- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.470
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

00:36.504 --> 00:40.374
Bottom line:
As long as you're burned,
you're not going anywhere.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.123
[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're pursuing someone,

00:55.156 --> 00:59.293
it's tempting to focus
exclusively on overtaking
the other person.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.335
It's often better to force
the person you're chasing...

01:07.368 --> 01:09.470
to go faster than
the terrain allows...

01:09.503 --> 01:11.805
and wait for them
to make a mistake.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.045
But even when a chase ends,

01:18.078 --> 01:21.482
you can never assume
the other person will
give up without a fight.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.417
It's over.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.419
It's not over, Michael.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.887
No. That was
our tie-breaker, Fi.

new life of yours, Michael.

01:42.436 --> 01:46.006
The people who
burned you are gone.
We're taking vacations.

01:46.039 --> 01:50.511
Yeah, these vacations are gonna
kill me pretty quickly if you
keep riding like that, Fi.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.146
There are worse ways

the Riviera, not a government

[ Sighs ]

02:31.752 --> 02:34.555
How was Costa Rica?
Not bad for
government funded R & R.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.390
Thanks for setting that up.
Yep.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.726
Consider it
a "welcome back" gift.

How long has it been?

Who's the job, actually--
Carson Huxley.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.575
He's a Brit, he's a genius,
and he's a very valuable
asset of ours.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.849
That guy?
He looks like he's
about to eat the worm.

03:01.882 --> 03:06.520
That guy has the I.Q.
of a rocket scientist and
the libido of a rock star.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.223
He's one of Her Majesty's
top nuclear engineers.

03:09.257 --> 03:13.227
He also likes to
cheat on his wife at
conferences like this.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.696
It's a blackmailer's dream
come true.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.065
All it takes
is a few pictures
with the wrong woman.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.302
[ Michael Narrating ]
Intelligence agencies spend
more money protecting secrets...

03:21.335 --> 03:23.003
than stealing them.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.240
But no digital encryption or
biometrically locked vaults...

03:26.274 --> 03:30.177
can keep sensitive information
from spilling out of
an indiscreet asset's mouth,

03:30.210 --> 03:34.982
which is why one of the most
common duties for a spy
is babysitting.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.751
We picked up
some chatter that
he'd be approached here.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.120
Any specifics on who's
doing the approaching?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.823
No, I don't know.
But I'm guessing
that whoever it is...

03:42.856 --> 03:44.958
is not gonna be too hard
on the eyes.

03:44.992 --> 03:48.095
You know the drill.
Chaperone the drunk, make
sure he doesn't get lucky.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.797
And we all sleep
easy at night.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.735

for someone like you.

have shown you this
before the others, but--

Good job, Maddy.

37:47.165 --> 37:48.434
Nihonto.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.808
Pack up your things, guys.
Your operation is over.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.311
- Who are you?
- Who am I doesn't matter.

37:59.345 --> 38:02.213
All you need to know is that
your good friend Takeda
was captured.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.783
- How you know that?
- Because I'm the guy
who captured him.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.885
What's Japanese for
"Drop your weapons"?

38:06.918 --> 38:08.654
- Oh, maybe something like this.

How are the girls?
- [ Sighs ]

38:36.615 --> 38:38.216
About as well
as one could hope.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.586
My firm's pulling some strings,
trying to get 'em
all home quickly.

38:40.619 --> 38:43.221
What about Takeda?
Feds picked him
and all his guys up.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.657
Japanese cops
took care of the rest
of them in Kyoto, so--

38:45.691 --> 38:49.194
They'll be spending a lot
more time in a confined space
than those girls did.

38:49.227 --> 38:54.566
Now, my firm gives me a little,
uh, discretionary fund
for emergencies.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.134
I think this counts.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.471
- No, you keep it, Jesse.
- Mike, take the money, man.

38:59.505 --> 39:03.775
Uh, excuse me.
I've helped Michael before,
and he's never paid me.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.744
All right. Well, thank you,
both of you, for everything.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.614
- No, thank you.
- I'll see you guys later.

39:11.917 --> 39:15.521
Here. Use that to fix up
your dad's Charger.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.426
Maybe it's time to just
leave the past in the past.

39:22.093 --> 39:25.964
Maybe it's time
to stare the past down
and deal with it, Michael.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.968
It happened,
for better or for worse.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.837
It made us who we are.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.106
All you can do now
is look towards the future.

39:43.815 --> 39:47.152
You should really
stop trying, Max.
[ Chuckles ]

[ Sighs ]

39:50.822 --> 39:52.424
I got your report on Huxley.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.894
I liked the read. I do have
a couple of notes on the story.
Oh?

39:55.927 --> 40:00.432
I'm not so sure how I feel about
a ex-I.R.A. operative's surprise
entrance in the second act.

40:01.199 --> 40:02.701
Fiona got the job done.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.403
She scared him celibate.
Yeah, she did.

40:05.437 --> 40:08.474
You know, there's a couple
of cardinal rules to this whole
government secret agent gig.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.308
First of all, it's secret.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.144
And secondly,
you're the agent,
not your girlfriend.

40:15.380 --> 40:18.183
Homework?
It's a gift.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.752
Improvisational jazz.
I kind of figured
it was your style.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.855
Stay safe, big boy.
We'll be in touch.

Jazz?
A present from Max.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.038
I think he felt bad about
giving me a talking-to.

40:40.071 --> 40:44.309
Let me guess. He was less than
thrilled with how I handled
the Huxley-sitting?

40:44.342 --> 40:48.046
Well, you did drive
130 miles an hour
down the Tamiami Trail.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.882
My way of doing things doesn't
work for the Boy Scouts.

40:52.851 --> 40:55.521
I want to talk to you, Fi.

40:55.554 --> 40:59.725
I haven't been able to sleep
well lately, and I've had
a lot of things on my mind,

40:59.758 --> 41:02.894
but I know we're going through
some big changes, you and I,

41:02.928 --> 41:05.664
and I don't want to
pile anything else on--

41:05.697 --> 41:07.432
You don't need
to explain, Michael.
I'm a big girl.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.570
You have an exciting new life.
I don't want to hold you back.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.806
You don't hold me back.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.043
That job I was doing
for the C.I.A.,

41:18.076 --> 41:20.311
it wouldn't have
succeeded without you.

41:20.345 --> 41:21.847
I need you, Fi.

41:23.448 --> 41:25.083
I got you something.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.587
Lumber?

41:28.620 --> 41:32.090
It's a shelf. I mean,
it's going to be a shelf.

41:32.123 --> 41:37.529
I was hoping you could put
your snow globes on it.

41:38.764 --> 41:42.033
It is a new job, Fi,
but it's not a new life.

41:42.067 --> 41:46.838
I like my life,
and I want to live it
with you, here.

I was trying to say.
