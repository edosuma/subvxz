00:13.890 --> 00:16.308
<i>In the not too distant future</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:26.319
I hope that works.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.530
Come on.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.030
Holy shit.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.413
Oh man, that will be damn tight.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.248
We were almost too late.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.334
Where do you want to go? So crap.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.420
Come on!

00:44.796 --> 00:46.464
I have it.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.051
Hey! Get out!
We have to get out of here.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.853
<i>6 days before</i>

00:59.853 --> 01:04.983
<i>Farewell, world</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:35.972
Oh God...

02:14.344 --> 02:16.386
Oh man, but they are well stocked.

02:25.772 --> 02:28.107
Damn it. Bingo.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.949
So what.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.401
Oh shit, damn it.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.034
Who's there?

04:02.118 --> 04:03.493
Elias?

04:04.662 --> 04:09.374
What's the matter, Roy?
What do these guys want in here?

04:09.666 --> 04:13.045
The transport will be right here.
What about your hut?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.381
Is wobbly, but still stands.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.426
Do not worry, folks!
You will not miss anything here.

04:19.426 --> 04:23.430
This shack is a wreck. The owner is
annoying and there is no tenant protection.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.392
This is for Carl. Connect his knee with it.
- Yeah, all right.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.655
<i>Where are you?</i>

05:25.034 --> 05:27.577
Elias?! Where are you?

05:30.248 --> 05:31.748
I'm so sorry.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.960
And what?

05:36.754 --> 05:39.716
That I leave you alone all the time.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.636
It can not be otherwise,
with what I do.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.848
I knew what I was going to do.

05:48.307 --> 05:51.560
I'm worried.
Something else could happen to you.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.771
I'll be fine. OK?

05:53.771 --> 05:56.857
Do not spend the whole
day worrying about me.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.736
Better take care of you.
- I'll be back, Bess.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.364
I know you will.

06:08.328 --> 06:12.582
<i>Elias, are you out there?
Elias, are you there? Over.</i>

06:15.293 --> 06:16.461
Yes I'm listening.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.337
<i>How did it go?</i>

06:21.173 --> 06:24.594
Most of the list I have found.

06:25.386 --> 06:29.599
You can tell Doc, I'll take it
over to him as fast as I can.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.769
<i>Roger that. Goose trouble?</i>

06:32.769 --> 06:34.354
Only the usual.

06:35.104 --> 06:38.815
I managed to blind a
drone with a grenade,

06:38.815 --> 06:42.736
But not really to damage.
<i>- I expect the full report later.</i>

06:42.736 --> 06:44.781
<i>end.</i>
- Yes, sir, you get.

07:01.714 --> 07:02.923
Well then...

07:03.173 --> 07:05.509
If you're a bomb, I'll get rid of all the worries.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.189
So what is that?

07:25.571 --> 07:27.697
And again, create the Hornets.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.386
Come on!

08:34.639 --> 08:36.476
Who screamed ?!

08:40.104 --> 08:41.397
Hey!

08:42.147 --> 08:45.192
Who cries? -What do you want?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.111
Open up!

08:52.074 --> 08:55.620
Who the hell are you?
- A friend of Frank,

08:55.620 --> 08:58.455
Who protects the house here.
- Is gone. Has been crushed.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.501
Where did he go?
- Am I his mother?

09:01.750 --> 09:04.879
Has vacated his place.
I am now the new one.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.174
Look at the dump, if
you do not believe me?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.471
Who cried?

09:14.889 --> 09:17.183
Probably the lady
on the 3rd floor.

09:17.433 --> 09:21.645
Her husband was killed last week.
Was probably too much for her.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.398
I'm Mike.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.568
Elias.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.987
So you are the famous Elias.

09:31.197 --> 09:33.949
Already heard from you.
- So? And what?

09:34.866 --> 09:38.037
That you are something like Mother
Theresa always helps everyone.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.997
Oh, do you say that?

09:40.289 --> 09:44.502
Hey man. Do not get me
wrong, I find the admirable.

09:44.794 --> 09:47.838
Something other than this
eternal "one-eats-the-other".

09:50.758 --> 09:52.635
Do you think there are extraterrestrials?

09:53.302 --> 09:56.972
All this here.
Invasion of extraterrestrials.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.975
It looks like it all.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.730
I just wish the little green
males came to the fore.

10:05.690 --> 10:08.108
Then it would finally be right what to fight,

10:08.108 --> 10:11.279
Instead of the shitty
attacks by the damn drones.

10:12.196 --> 10:15.198
In truth, they are
yellow when you ask me.

10:19.578 --> 10:22.248
I check up what's going on.
Take it down. - Okay.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.037
Holy...

11:09.586 --> 11:13.548
As you see, one-eats-the-other
is literally meant.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.053
Human meat tastes better.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.096
Yes!

12:01.597 --> 12:03.014
No movement!

12:05.350 --> 12:06.727
Do not worry.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.022
I am not a savage.
Am quite peaceful.

12:10.772 --> 12:14.150
What's going on here?
- There is trouble on the street.

12:15.068 --> 12:19.198
The supply truck.
- Yes, there is always trouble on the street.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.285
Where do you live?
- In a shelter in Koreatown.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.499
Better go back,
it's too dangerous.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.252
I can see that I'm bringing
you something to eat.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.131
Come on!
- Thank you. - All right.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.732
<i>Bang! Bang! Bang!</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:58.987
Come on, you bitch. How's it going
on the south side? - Hey, Elias.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.783
Road with nail chains.
The front ones are in the bucket. - Real shit.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.784
May I help you?
- Thank you, we come clear.

13:05.661 --> 13:06.453
Crap!

13:08.413 --> 13:10.123
Come on, there's the sow!

13:10.916 --> 13:12.041
Out of the way, bum.

13:16.756 --> 13:17.839
Hey. hey!

13:18.966 --> 13:21.426
Looks like you're all alone.

13:21.718 --> 13:26.306
Come on, Rhys.
Just this one time, agreed?

13:27.224 --> 13:30.770
There are people who really need the food.
- I really need it.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.397
We live in difficult times.
You see, Elias.

13:33.772 --> 13:37.108
I say it quite simply:
When I'm hungry,

13:37.108 --> 13:38.777
then I eat.

13:39.779 --> 13:43.449
Maybe I'll eat you as a neighbor.
- You can try this,

13:43.449 --> 13:45.909
But I already taste a bit gammy.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.371
Drones!

13:49.371 --> 13:50.830
Path! Go away!

13:50.830 --> 13:52.332
Come on!

13:54.502 --> 13:56.252
Hurry!

14:15.146 --> 14:18.024
Nice toys. I'm on it.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.198
<i>Attention! The entire crew
to the Baker loader lamp.</i>

14:24.198 --> 14:26.992
<i>The supply has arrived.
The supply has arrived.</i>

14:27.200 --> 14:30.287
<i>Start for immediate
unloading and distribution.</i>

14:30.537 --> 14:33.833
<i>Attention! The entire crew
to the Baker loader lamp.</i>

14:33.833 --> 14:35.167
<i>The supply has arrived.</i>

14:35.167 --> 14:37.419
I saw no truck on your
list for this week?

14:37.419 --> 14:40.296
Rhys and his horde did the
South Central Transport team.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.967
No survivor.
- I'm talking to her commander.

14:42.967 --> 14:46.595
The second loss this week.
These hurenses are becoming more and more dreary.

15:01.819 --> 15:04.279
No losses.
If you do not count the truck.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.074
We'll get them another time.

15:07.074 --> 15:11.202
The markets south of the city... - They are
empty swept. - Do you think I do not know?

15:11.202 --> 15:13.162
We still look up again.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.456
Clear.

15:17.585 --> 15:19.878
Wait a moment, Zane.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.589
There's something else.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.887
You're the only one I can trust.

15:28.596 --> 15:31.306
Do not worry, Rhys.
They are all loyal.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.100
Up to a certain point.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.811
Until they think themselves
cleverer than their leader.

15:35.811 --> 15:38.314
They are already doing this.
- It can not be,

15:38.314 --> 15:40.900
That they are content
with a full stomach.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.113
In times like these, it is
enough to survive. - Yes, most.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.656
But since when do we think like that?

15:49.074 --> 15:51.200
Only survive is for squirrels.

15:51.868 --> 15:56.039
When I was in the army, I
respected only the officers,

15:56.039 --> 15:58.625
Who risked everything to win.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.171
Taking chances is the only
true path to success.

16:03.380 --> 16:07.717
The Colonel in his
ivory tower...

16:08.218 --> 16:11.346
He should not be the one
to lead the defense.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.557
You should do it, Rhys.

16:15.059 --> 16:19.145
No. The system does as if it were looking
for innovators and their own minds,

16:19.145 --> 16:21.773
But they did not want me in their army.

16:21.982 --> 16:27.278
That is why I have set up my own.
- And? What you up to?

16:27.278 --> 16:28.822
What am I doing ?!

16:31.532 --> 16:35.828
The Hornets gave Elias a special
weapon in their crudely unaware.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.082
You saw what she can do.
- I've never seen a drone run off.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.418
I agree.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.338
This weapon becomes our new trump card.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.849
Hey, Doc!
- Say you've found everything.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.770
Hopefully everything in it.
- Thank you, Elias.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.855
Food and medicine are the most important.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.192
We can only fight the enemy
if we remain strong.

17:05.400 --> 17:10.029
I have something in my backpack, which
could significantly improve our chances.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.493
They do not believe
what they gave me.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.540
I came home, and this
was waiting for me.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.960
Does it matter?
- It has more power than anything from us.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.339
It does not destroy them, but it hides them.
Gives us a bit of time.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.216
It fires a kind of
densified laser.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.803
A gift from the Hornets?
- Of those or the Santa Claus.

17:39.727 --> 17:41.687
I hope we get more weapons.

17:42.646 --> 17:46.482
According to the latest report an
invasion group approaches the east coast.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.402
We need all the
firepower we can get.

17:50.069 --> 17:54.907
Getty! Take a look at what
Elias brought with us.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.662
In two hours I will know all about it.
- If you bring fleas back,

17:58.662 --> 18:01.664
I can not help you.
- Not at all, scratch it.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.795
The thing does not come from China.
Let's check it out.

18:20.434 --> 18:23.603
This was already fired.
- How do you know this?

18:24.354 --> 18:26.273
Has a counter.
Let's see.

18:29.818 --> 18:33.905
This little shit uses a highly
developed target detection technology.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.159
And also high-energy
lithium-air batteries.

18:38.368 --> 18:43.248
Missile capability.
A charger was not there, right?

18:44.415 --> 18:45.958
Why you?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.836
No idea.
- I think it does not suit you either.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.756
You're right.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.799
Let's see what the thing can do.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.308
Genius, these insects.
Whoever they are.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.979
I only wish they came out of the cover.
- The Colonel says they have a plan.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.189
He can not say which one.
But they have one.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.192
We just do not overlook
the big picture.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.945
An indication would already suffice.
- For this I would like a manual.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.782
And a bloody steak
with a good cabernet.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.246
Tell me about the big picture.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.126
Yes, man, really bad.

19:27.876 --> 19:31.380
And they say we are still lucky.
The East Coast has got it full.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.840
Such luck, too.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.635
Come on!

19:39.095 --> 19:41.807
What's happening. Sir?

19:41.807 --> 19:43.641
Three groups a two. Eagle lineup.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.687
Ah, they brought their brethren with them.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.439
Come the hundredth.
- Very fast.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.777
Typical. Only a world sunset
clears the freeway. - Wait!

19:53.777 --> 19:55.945
They are slower.
Are near Koreatown.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.947
What are you looking for?

19:58.281 --> 20:00.575
People.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.410
They're looking for people, sir.

20:02.953 --> 20:04.621
Elias, wait!

20:12.295 --> 20:13.755
Let's get out of here!

20:13.755 --> 20:16.049
Hurry, come on.
Are everyone there?

20:16.717 --> 20:17.842
Come on!

20:25.308 --> 20:26.977
Take it easy, you disappear!

20:29.688 --> 20:32.064
Make sure you get away!

20:34.151 --> 20:35.527
Disappear at last.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.572
Come on! Into the house around the corner.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.951
Pure there.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.244
Take care, pure there.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.621
Hurry.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.291
Sit down, Garth. Yes, that's good.

20:51.168 --> 20:53.002
Wall times, let's see.

20:53.002 --> 20:56.756
We can not stay here. Let us go.
- Do not scream like that,

20:56.756 --> 20:59.717
The people are already scared enough.
He needs a printing bandage.

20:59.717 --> 21:03.430
I've got something.
Are you a doctor? - Thank you.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.015
Paramedic.
An idea how things are going now?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.559
Yes, not far from here
is a deployment center.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.271
With food and medicine.
- Heaven on earth. - That's the way it is,

21:11.479 --> 21:13.689
As long as it is still there.
What's your name? - Kate.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.818
I am Elias.
We need to get away! - Okay.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.404
Get up!
- Get up, move.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.031
Back out, hurry.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.282
Come on! - Come on, folks!

21:27.204 --> 21:29.248
How far is it?
- We're almost there.

21:29.831 --> 21:33.542
What did you lose up there?
So you can kill yourself.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.796
We are from San Diego.
The city is a single cemetery.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.882
Yeah.
- No food no water.

21:40.091 --> 21:43.427
A convoy has brought us here.
Just before the <i> city </i> we were attacked.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.055
How many were you? - 75.

21:47.057 --> 21:50.601
Only we are left.
- I'm really sorry.

21:51.395 --> 21:54.314
I did not meet anyone who
could get rid of the things.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.900
Some things get better.

21:58.902 --> 22:01.362
Hey, Getty! Getty?

22:02.114 --> 22:05.199
If you can hear me, tell Doc,
I'll bring some wounded.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.911
Wait a minute.
The crap is just on the steam.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.788
Big Apple!
Come, Big Apple. Here is Angel One.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.166
We will respond to your emergency call.
Come, Big Apple.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.505
You do not answer, sir.
- Try it.

22:20.299 --> 22:22.717
Big Apple! Come, Big Apple.
Here is Angel One.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.594
Can you hear me? Over.

22:25.344 --> 22:29.682
<i>Angel One. Here's Big Apple.
We have strong electrical disturbances.</i>

22:29.682 --> 22:32.644
<i>Possibly an attack with
electromagnetic waves.</i>

22:32.644 --> 22:34.896
<i>We are sewing a large flying object.</i>

22:34.896 --> 22:36.814
<i>Probably a drones battle ship.</i>

22:37.023 --> 22:39.276
<i>Larger than anything so far.</i>

22:39.276 --> 22:43.571
<i>One moment please. The ground of the
flying object begins to glow. Massive...</i>

22:58.086 --> 23:00.796
Here through. - Quiet, very quiet.
- Put him on the bed. - Calm.

23:01.464 --> 23:04.133
Doc, we need you here, fast.
- One moment please!

23:04.133 --> 23:05.676
And here. Caution, Caution!

23:07.554 --> 23:10.890
My friend has 3rd degree bleeding.
He needs fresh blood urgently.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.893
I am a paramedic.
- Can you feel a fracture? - Clear.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.646
Let's go.
- Elias! Now listen.

23:17.314 --> 23:20.817
Yes, sir?
- New York was completely eradicated.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.611
The Hornets tried to help, but...

23:23.862 --> 23:26.782
The same kind of drones as in New
York are now also in Chicago.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.492
First, the big cities are devastated.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.369
That is, we are the next.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.580
What do we do with
the people here?

23:33.788 --> 23:35.582
They can neither go nor run.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.377
Before that, we can not run away.
We have to fight.

23:39.044 --> 23:42.005
What about the Hornets?
Are they planning an offensive?

23:42.005 --> 23:44.090
Not since the destruction of New York.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.219
Hold an earthquake!

23:48.804 --> 23:51.305
<i>Colonel, we need you up here, right away.</i>

23:51.305 --> 23:53.641
Roger that. I'm on my way.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.436
Let us prepare ourselves for the worst.
If the Hornets,

23:57.436 --> 24:01.732
We need you.
That is an order. - Of course, sir.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.652
What else?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.824
Hey. - Hey.
- Everything OK?

24:09.824 --> 24:11.284
Yes of course. Thank you.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.620
Do you need something else?
- No, I have everything.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.581
I'm leaving now.
See you. - Is good.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.626
Hey, Getty, here is Elias.

24:20.836 --> 24:24.047
I now go over to my booth in the
6th vector. How is it outside?

24:24.047 --> 24:27.842
<i>Patrol drones, as usual, Boss.
No swarms. Take care of yourself.</i>

24:31.471 --> 24:35.100
When was the last time you slept?
- No idea.

24:35.307 --> 24:39.604
Lie down on my couch.
At the moment I do not need them often.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.607
I'm good.
- Please, if you overturn, do not help me.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.193
That will not happen.
- Yes, it will!

24:48.612 --> 24:51.366
Excuse me, I'm a little
grumpy about everything here.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.661
I'm glad you're here...
- Kate.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.955
I'm Erwin.
But nobody calls me like that.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.583
Even my mother called me Doc.
- All right, Doc.

25:00.583 --> 25:01.959
Nice if I can help.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.716
You are wounded!
- Nothing else. That's OK.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.635
Stop hitting the hard.
- All right.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.972
Amazing what you
put on your feet.

25:15.182 --> 25:18.476
In the flood of wounded.
- In the beginning I got a lot of help.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.272
I had my brother.

25:22.771 --> 25:27.777
He came back in search of supplies.
- I'm sorry.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.032
Elias appeared at the time.

25:32.365 --> 25:35.619
One of our patrols found him
half-dead outside the stadium.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.206
They brought him here
and I mended him.

25:39.413 --> 25:44.001
Since then he has been collecting the
coals for us from the fire. - He's full.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.836
Saved our asses.

25:46.128 --> 25:49.465
Is apparently his hobby,
but do not ask why.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.968
Everyone needs something
that keeps him alive.

25:53.887 --> 25:57.098
The first is to take
care of themselves.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.557
The other...

25:59.309 --> 26:01.143
? Try to save the world?

26:02.102 --> 26:04.898
Maybe a bit late for that.
- I do not understand.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.859
Perhaps we would have a chance
with more people like Elias.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.153
Maybe you're right, I do not know.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.614
The Colonel, in any case, relied on him.

26:14.282 --> 26:18.160
A Colonel has a say here?
- Yes, he is the officer with the highest rank.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.622
In this sector.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.417
Is a good man, dedicated, but
soldier, that is realist.

26:24.625 --> 26:29.339
I have to leave the order, in case
of an evacuation, all the bedridden.

26:31.757 --> 26:36.221
Victims are brought to ensure the
survival of others, he says.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.099
I'm not entirely of his opinion.

26:39.890 --> 26:44.395
<i>Attention! All scouts gather at
Dock 3 for the night patrol.</i>

26:44.395 --> 26:46.606
<i>All scouts to the loading dock 3.</i>

26:46.606 --> 26:51.820
What is this at all? Is somehow
semi-shelter and semi-deployment center.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.946
That's quite well.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.577
Four emergency bases were built
after the first attacks.

26:59.911 --> 27:03.289
In any case, there is
something like order here.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.835
There was no such thing in San Diego.

27:07.168 --> 27:10.129
No law. No hiding places.

27:11.047 --> 27:14.009
When there was no more food,
we went back to the Stone Age.

27:14.884 --> 27:17.220
On the streets the naked madness.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.222
Yes.
- The people began to...

27:20.432 --> 27:23.892
I've heard.
Did not, frankly, surprise me.

27:24.810 --> 27:29.608
Order and security are
just an illusion.

27:29.608 --> 27:32.901
They are something that we are talking
about, so that we feel better.

27:34.362 --> 27:37.032
Do you understand?
Like this mighty building.

27:37.032 --> 27:39.199
It's really powerful.
It will protect us.

27:41.995 --> 27:44.330
But I tell you Kate...

27:46.207 --> 27:50.003
It is always harder for me to
keep my head from this slaughter.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.757
Hold on, Doc.
They make this great.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.180
Thank you.
And now you're resting, yeah? - Yes.

28:00.430 --> 28:02.807
I'll wake you up in a couple
of hours, then help Linda.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.162
Do not panic, it's just me.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.874
What the hell have happened to you, Bro?

28:29.084 --> 28:31.002
The blanket fell on my head.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.462
Do not tell shit.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.340
Does not look good.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.634
Does not feel good either.

28:37.842 --> 28:40.553
We go back to the base
and you come with us.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.555
No is not accepted.
- All right.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.210
Damn it.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.842
Oh, wow.

29:24.472 --> 29:27.100
What does the thing
do with human flesh?

29:28.142 --> 29:30.019
It just melt, presumably.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.606
Like your face was
dipped in lava.

29:34.648 --> 29:38.445
I'm not your enemy, Rhys.
- Sure, we're good friends.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.196
Do not let us exaggerate.
- Why not?

29:43.115 --> 29:45.243
You have a nice place here.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.580
Oh how sweet.

29:49.456 --> 29:52.751
Looked more tidy than
your lady was still here.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.420
Do not touch it, put it away.
- He's so sensitive.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.880
Really impractical in these times, right?

29:58.088 --> 30:02.594
Focus on the real enemy
and stop fucking us all!

30:03.010 --> 30:06.680
Who is the real enemy?
Who controls these machines?

30:06.889 --> 30:09.017
We do not know that.
Nobody knows that.

30:09.017 --> 30:11.435
Then the machines act independently?

30:11.435 --> 30:14.813
These so-called Hornets
seem damned much to know.

30:15.022 --> 30:18.692
And if they know so much, then
they are probably behind it.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.862
That's crazy.
You're sick, Rhys.

30:21.862 --> 30:26.074
I want a meeting
with your friends.

30:26.284 --> 30:30.037
I have a few questions to them.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.875
This is not the case.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.423
It would also be in your
interest to get it.

30:42.842 --> 30:46.345
If you want to keep
your pretty face.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.767
Watch out!

31:00.234 --> 31:02.028
Roy! Roy!

31:24.509 --> 31:26.219
<i>Elias.</i>

31:26.760 --> 31:29.263
<i>Elias, where are you?</i>

31:34.602 --> 31:35.937
Help me!

31:36.186 --> 31:37.272
Help me!

31:47.407 --> 31:49.533
Excuse the theater, Sergeant.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.035
People should not know
when we come and go.

31:54.455 --> 31:56.791
All right.
You belong to the Hornets?

31:56.791 --> 31:58.292
Highest rank.

31:59.251 --> 32:03.463
Science or military?
- Can I be both? - Clear.

32:05.258 --> 32:08.093
I thought most of
you are scientists.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.513
Many of them are.
We come from both areas,

32:10.513 --> 32:12.890
Public and private. - Yeah.

32:13.891 --> 32:18.021
How do you like the new weapon?
- Oh, it's fantastic.

32:18.313 --> 32:21.566
I wish we had a million of it.
- We are working on it.

32:21.774 --> 32:25.277
We took a few changes
while you slept.

32:26.446 --> 32:28.740
To the test phase also
belongs to the sergeant.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.618
I should like to inform you:
They have passed with flying colors.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.954
Does not feel so.

32:51.554 --> 32:54.724
How are the others?
- Vesna is dead.

32:54.724 --> 32:59.938
The rest is pissed and half-blind.
Just like me.

33:00.647 --> 33:02.981
These Hornets. - What?

33:04.567 --> 33:06.194
These were the Hornets.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.948
The used a high-tech
Blend grenade.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.950
Your eyes are clear.

33:11.950 --> 33:15.620
The Hornets use light bombs instead of
killing. - Because they do not want us.

33:15.870 --> 33:18.914
But him. We are only inconsiderable
harassment for those,

33:19.123 --> 33:22.292
small fish. - But I'm offended.
- You should, too.

33:22.501 --> 33:25.254
Why are the Hornets so
shittily greedy for this guy?

33:25.462 --> 33:28.131
What makes this guy so special?
- He's clean.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.468
Like the Colonel.
It fulfills the requirements.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.929
Image is not a war.

33:34.262 --> 33:38.267
They totally surpass Elias'
importance and we underestimate you.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.188
But I change that. - And how?

33:43.689 --> 33:47.819
We have achieved quite a bit with
a fairly small bunch of people.

33:49.028 --> 33:52.155
Now imagine, we would be
much bigger, proportionate.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.701
How do you do that with Castings?
- No.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.411
And when you do it,
the yield was lean.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.621
Vesna was our last good weapon.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.249
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

34:04.377 --> 34:06.837
You can not be serious? Bone ?!

34:07.879 --> 34:12.342
He has the manpower. - Yes, and he
has four notches on his rifle butts,

34:12.342 --> 34:16.513
For our people he has done.
- We have drawn together!

34:16.806 --> 34:19.016
You take that too personally, Zane.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.728
I...
Where chips are planted, chips fall.

34:22.937 --> 34:26.982
A few losses belong to our business.
- Say this time Butchy,

34:26.982 --> 34:29.152
Mac, Sheila and Alex.

34:29.777 --> 34:32.904
Yes / Yes...
Alex, was that his name?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.822
Your. - Your.

34:35.658 --> 34:39.536
If so, anyway.
An alliance would make us really strong.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.998
A force powerful enough to
really change this city.

34:43.708 --> 34:48.795
From a city that constantly
recedes, into one that attacks.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.802
Call him.
- I can not do better.

34:57.679 --> 34:58.681
Take care!

35:02.184 --> 35:03.769
Oh, and Zane...

35:05.646 --> 35:07.231
Please, be nice.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.831
Are you going!

35:33.508 --> 35:37.220
<i>Guard Officer,</i>
<i>the staff management awaits your report.</i>

35:37.553 --> 35:40.765
They are pretty well posed here.
How many people do you have?

35:40.765 --> 35:44.560
Not enough. We have lost many
good people in New York.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.104
But we're building new teams. All over.

35:47.939 --> 35:50.732
Yes? For what?

35:50.732 --> 35:54.779
Well, let's just say, for
the days of waiting.

35:54.779 --> 35:59.909
The days of hope just disappear.
To be honest, they are already over.

36:01.368 --> 36:02.537
Hallelujah...

36:10.711 --> 36:12.546
Cool cut! - What?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.714
Oh nothing!
- I thought so.

36:16.259 --> 36:19.052
Okay, there's a lot of bad blood here in the room.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.888
But we can not undo things.

36:22.682 --> 36:25.268
I'll tell you something now. Bone.

36:29.856 --> 36:34.068
Times of despair call for
extraordinary measures, right?

36:36.070 --> 36:42.075
Who is desperate? - Did not you
tell everyone he was not a liar?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.453
Why should I listen to you at all?

36:45.662 --> 36:47.664
Because I'm telling the truth.

36:48.124 --> 36:51.961
And because this truth
will move mountains!

36:52.169 --> 36:54.379
When we bundle our forces.

36:57.175 --> 37:00.260
No, it's okay.

37:02.680 --> 37:07.393
The Hornets have given the keys
to the kingdom the gentle.

37:08.561 --> 37:13.940
This is a mistake. No, this
prophecy proved to be a lie!

37:13.940 --> 37:15.901
They are not supposed to take over the earth!

37:16.193 --> 37:20.864
We will subdue their
fortress and take control.

37:21.240 --> 37:26.162
There's everything. Information, weapons,
the foundations of our new beginning.

37:27.872 --> 37:31.291
Bone, if we alliance, the power
of the Hornets will belong to us.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.671
What do I get from that?

37:39.007 --> 37:42.178
We make half-a-half,
half for each.

37:42.178 --> 37:44.805
If you want less,
I'm not sad either.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.979
My brother.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.357
We just caught a radio call.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.652
From Vegas comes a delivery
of fresh food and medicine.

37:58.652 --> 38:01.989
Come across the bridge on 6th Street
in four hours. - Class! Class!

38:02.281 --> 38:04.659
This is our ticket, so go!
Let's go.

38:07.744 --> 38:11.499
Success or failure mainly
depend on the timing, Sergeant.

38:11.499 --> 38:13.417
They are here, for phase 4.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.880
What is Phase 4? Not that I know
what are the phases 1, 2 and 3.

38:18.339 --> 38:20.090
10 more clicks to the finish, Ma'am.

38:22.926 --> 38:26.013
They swallowed the bait.
- What kind of bait?

38:27.180 --> 38:30.893
Three weeks ago, our specialists
deciphered access to the machines.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.435
Can you see it.

38:32.645 --> 38:36.273
The scrambles communicate in a
very complex, electrical language.

38:36.273 --> 38:39.151
Like insect patter.
When we had decrypted it,

38:39.151 --> 38:41.569
We realized we can
send them messages.

38:41.779 --> 38:44.991
They think they're helping
a downed comrade,

38:44.991 --> 38:48.034
But instead she expects
a nasty surprise.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.123
Let me guess the
thing is booming?

38:52.664 --> 38:55.042
And that mighty, powerful mighty.

38:55.042 --> 38:57.670
Charge them.
And go out with her right away.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.071
Give me camera 9.
- Yes, Ma'am.

39:26.114 --> 39:29.743
I never saw a drone on the ground.
How did you get it?

39:29.952 --> 39:33.913
We've done it with an improved
version of the weapon that you have.

39:34.749 --> 39:36.541
Knowledge makes us strong.

39:38.919 --> 39:42.047
This and time are the most valuable.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.508
5 clicks, comes closer.

39:45.801 --> 39:48.595
Why does a drone come
to save another,

39:48.595 --> 39:51.848
If they are only robots.
Why do they care? But that is...

39:52.140 --> 39:54.560
Like soldiers.
They follow instructions.

39:54.851 --> 39:58.481
Not much different from you and me.
Are on a rescue mission.

40:02.068 --> 40:03.694
Still <i> 2 </i> clicks, Ma'am.

40:05.654 --> 40:09.407
<i>Hey, wait.
The...</i>

40:09.783 --> 40:11.285
This is not a scapegoat.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.331
Believing in the impossible
made you the one who is you.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.586
Do not give it up.
- Yes, but these mother ships can

40:20.586 --> 40:23.380
To destroy a whole city.
What are they doing here?

40:23.380 --> 40:24.507
Target within sight.

40:31.013 --> 40:33.724
How is the status?
- The unit is in position.

40:33.933 --> 40:35.309
Activate.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.352
Yes, Ma'am. Activated.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.939
<i>Armored</i>

40:41.940 --> 40:44.026
How do you know if this works?

40:44.693 --> 40:48.280
We do not know.
It worked fine.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.407
Twelve lapsed at once.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.660
It works like a
swelling amplifier

40:53.660 --> 40:55.454
Of ever-repeated explosions.

40:55.703 --> 40:59.290
One triggers the next. It spreads
in the ship like a computer virus,

40:59.499 --> 41:03.671
Until the beast is dead.
- But you're not sure.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.550
That is why we call this a test.
Come with me.

41:09.135 --> 41:13.555
We have used teams in some large
cities that work with similar devices.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.016
The signal lancers have
great attractiveness,

41:16.224 --> 41:19.645
So there are no drones on the
ground to complete your mission.

41:20.437 --> 41:24.023
That we have just one here is a happy
coincidence. - Are you waiting.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.361
My mission?
- Los Angeles is one of your main attractions.

41:27.569 --> 41:30.113
You will receive a code
to activate your device.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.032
Kill the beasts.

41:45.004 --> 41:46.754
Where <i> is </i> Davis <i> and Martin?</i>

41:46.754 --> 41:48.549
Just go back, Ma'am.

41:49.258 --> 41:52.302
Take it all, Elias.
Whatever happens,

41:52.302 --> 41:56.181
That's the only way to get ahead.
The only way to defeat them.

41:56.473 --> 41:58.934
What's wrong with the
things, who's behind it?

41:59.184 --> 42:02.813
No idea. We could not
prove biological life.

42:02.813 --> 42:05.273
As far as we know, everything is mechanical.

42:06.108 --> 42:10.738
Powerful drilling machines that extract
liquid metal from the earth's core.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.449
The goal has stopped, Ma'am.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.121
Prepare to fire!

42:19.121 --> 42:20.038
<i>Ready!</i>

42:21.749 --> 42:23.375
Put on glasses.

42:26.879 --> 42:28.589
I hope that works.

42:32.551 --> 42:35.095
<i>Davis and Martin are done.</i>
- <i> bastards. Fackle them off!</i>

42:35.387 --> 42:36.388
I fire.

42:42.978 --> 42:45.605
What is the status of the target?
- Hard to say <i> to </i>, Ma'am.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.315
<i>We have strong electrical disturbances.</i>

42:47.315 --> 42:50.444
Looks like it's going to
disappear and got a big deal.

42:50.444 --> 42:52.862
But is not done yet.
Not yet.

42:53.322 --> 42:55.282
We need to change the virus.

42:59.077 --> 43:02.373
When is the van coming?
- Within the next hour.

43:02.373 --> 43:06.501
We also increased the activity of Rhys
and his people in the sector? reported.

43:07.670 --> 43:10.713
Just three times as many people,
we need this delivery. - Sir!

43:13.007 --> 43:17.471
What belongs to Elijah? - No, sir.
Our last contact is over 8 hours ago.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.473
Since then he had not heard from him.
Not his kind.

43:31.068 --> 43:34.571
Doc, here is a woman with terrible pain.
Can I give her morphia?

43:35.071 --> 43:38.366
It's empty.
- I need antibiotics, she is badly wounded.

43:38.366 --> 43:40.618
Is everything gone.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.455
You can... At the office is a
bottle of brandy, take the.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.749
Is good. - What belongs to Elias?

43:46.625 --> 43:49.712
There is a rumor of a delivery
which is about to arrive.

43:49.712 --> 43:52.506
Maybe he's drifting around there.
- I hope he does.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.299
Hold tight!

43:56.093 --> 43:59.554
One thing is certain: we are on
the right track. Let's go back.

44:01.056 --> 44:04.100
Attention, attack!
- They send attack drones.

44:06.186 --> 44:08.147
We have to leave here. Immediately.

44:18.907 --> 44:21.535
Makes the helicopter start.
I stop them.

44:33.589 --> 44:35.757
Come on, hurry.

44:36.759 --> 44:38.719
Make sure you get
behind the shelter!

44:42.056 --> 44:43.974
Come on! Running!

44:57.363 --> 44:59.365
Hurry, do it, run!

45:16.964 --> 45:20.511
We need to get away from here.
- Hurry up. Make sure you get away!

45:20.803 --> 45:23.513
And the rest of your team?
- Do their job.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.431
This is ours.

45:41.698 --> 45:44.450
Still has its spine,
the mother ship.

45:45.911 --> 45:47.788
Its a lot to do.

45:47.788 --> 45:51.125
We have no time.
- A lot less than you think.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.834
Sucking the further so fast,

45:52.834 --> 45:56.462
This planet can soon no
longer sustain human life.

45:56.964 --> 46:00.509
And how much time is left?
- A few weeks, with some luck.

46:01.510 --> 46:03.970
We also found something
under the earth.

46:04.220 --> 46:07.933
Is perhaps nothing, but we
consider it a new form of drone.

46:07.933 --> 46:11.018
Where we are at drones.
Why do not they follow the helicopter?

46:11.018 --> 46:14.981
We are disguised. Until they decipher it.
Just like your vehicle.

46:15.648 --> 46:17.191
What vehicle?

46:17.401 --> 46:22.614
You will see. Do not forget:
Your job is to save L.A., which it also costs.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.369
Your activation code for the device in L.A.

46:30.329 --> 46:34.084
Where is the bomb? - It is only
urgently necessary to modify them.

46:34.293 --> 46:36.794
We'll let you know when it's finished.
- Okay.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.882
Colonel Jayden also receives
the bomb coordinates.

46:39.882 --> 46:42.633
If something happens to you, he
brings the operation to an end.

46:43.510 --> 46:45.679
We will take you to
the edge of the city.

46:45.679 --> 46:48.890
At an old military radio station
from the Second World War.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.726
There is an armed transport.

46:51.726 --> 46:55.354
You can not locate the drones.
- I understand.

46:55.564 --> 46:58.108
There's something else, Elias.

46:59.026 --> 47:01.361
Be careful!

47:09.076 --> 47:10.162
Au Back!

47:19.378 --> 47:21.380
Hopefully I can drive the thing.

47:26.345 --> 47:29.723
<i>Attention! The entire crew
to the Baker loader lamp.</i>

47:29.932 --> 47:33.560
<i>The truck has arrived.
To unload and distribute.</i>

47:35.019 --> 47:37.481
Where were you?
We were waiting for you!

47:39.399 --> 47:41.275
Come on, boys, let's go!

47:53.621 --> 47:55.248
Let's go to work!

47:57.000 --> 48:00.711
There were shots. Some guys pushed in
at the bottom. - Built barricades!

48:00.711 --> 48:02.421
Alpha and delta. Come on. Go Go!

48:04.382 --> 48:06.426
I am not a soldier.
- From now on.

48:08.804 --> 48:11.598
Attention!
It is shot.

48:11.598 --> 48:13.516
It is shot.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.434
What's happening?
- The shoot. - Who then?

48:16.228 --> 48:18.564
Do not go.
We have to take care of the people.

48:18.772 --> 48:21.400
Doc! What about weapons?
Are there any ?!

48:26.863 --> 48:28.364
I hate sick people.

48:28.615 --> 48:30.284
Stop!
- What do you want? - Stop!

48:30.783 --> 48:32.577
We have only just begun.

48:32.577 --> 48:35.789
Find out how we get up!
Slick, put these assholes away.

48:35.789 --> 48:38.833
I do not want to catch anything. Slick!
- Hello my beautiful.

48:40.335 --> 48:42.420
Zane, I need the direct
wire to the Colonel.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.380
I want to play mild big.
Come on!

48:45.298 --> 48:47.300
You damn pig!

48:50.553 --> 48:51.929
Take care!

48:53.139 --> 48:54.641
No no no no no.

48:55.474 --> 48:58.728
We can not kill anyone
who is ready to fight.

48:58.728 --> 49:01.272
I would never fight
for you, you scum.

49:01.272 --> 49:04.318
Hey, not at all.
You do not know what you're missing.

49:12.617 --> 49:15.036
Keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir.

49:21.001 --> 49:23.461
Something heard from below?
- No, nothing, sir.

49:24.337 --> 49:27.466
Try to reach Sergeant Bennet in South Side.
- I tried.

49:27.466 --> 49:30.301
They do not answer.
- Sir! You have contacted us.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.511
Who?
- The Hornets. Very official.

49:32.511 --> 49:34.472
They give instructions.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.975
It has begun. - What?

49:37.643 --> 49:39.478
Revenge!

49:53.867 --> 49:56.243
How is it?
- Nothing. Until now.

49:56.453 --> 49:59.081
Spend quietly further
precious time with Blondie.

49:59.748 --> 50:02.084
Jealous?
- I hate such women.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.043
The little mischief!

50:04.043 --> 50:06.671
You can sniff my rifle at once.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.923
Come down.
You'll get them in time.

50:09.632 --> 50:13.053
Let us look at the reward.
We must go to the command center.

50:13.053 --> 50:16.222
I do not want our guys rumstreunern
like young puppies. - So what!

50:16.222 --> 50:20.643
Done! The main deployment center
is probably in one of the rooms

50:20.643 --> 50:22.728
In the upper floor.
Directly under the roof.

50:23.438 --> 50:26.649
The accesses are obviously
defended with machine guns.

50:26.649 --> 50:29.151
If we attack them
frontally, we are crushed.

50:29.527 --> 50:31.487
But we have Bones men.

50:31.697 --> 50:35.867
Let them be the cannon fodder.
Which way is the most direct?

50:36.493 --> 50:37.994
It is difficult to read from this.

50:37.994 --> 50:40.204
There are elevator
batteries and stairs.

50:40.204 --> 50:43.165
But can also be explosions
or lead to emptiness.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.044
Then we reduce the options.
Here we go.

50:51.216 --> 50:52.883
You have beautiful hair.

50:53.592 --> 50:56.638
Hey, Doc. What is the shortest
way to the command center?

50:56.638 --> 50:58.890
No idea. I'm just a doctor.

50:59.599 --> 51:02.269
Will you tell me you've
never been up there? - Yes.

51:02.477 --> 51:05.062
Not even to measure the colonel fever?
- I agree.

51:05.856 --> 51:09.317
Man, that's interesting.

51:10.443 --> 51:11.902
You stupid asshole!

51:12.237 --> 51:14.531
No no.
Only someone with great determination.

51:15.656 --> 51:19.453
How do I get to the command center?
- Do not tell him.

51:19.453 --> 51:20.829
No! No no!

51:24.582 --> 51:27.294
I'll show you.
- Come on, then.

51:27.294 --> 51:30.004
The good doctor will show us the way.
Radio the others.

51:33.883 --> 51:38.179
You can not wage war if you constantly
hold your eggs with one hand.

51:38.430 --> 51:42.225
The Colonel is not a leader,
he is not even a good soldier.

51:43.017 --> 51:45.603
That's why it's better
if I take the reins.

51:45.936 --> 51:49.357
Here is your wire to the commander.
Is a bit bloody.

51:49.357 --> 51:51.026
Is yes disgusting...

51:52.611 --> 51:54.820
What?
- They do not know exactly what is going on.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.952
Here is what moves.
- Loader Delta.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.621
Keep them as long as you can.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.749
Sir, have lost contact
with Bergman and Green!

52:05.749 --> 52:09.794
And there are at least 12 intruders.
- The coordinates are not allowed!

52:09.794 --> 52:12.172
Safe the laptop.
If necessary, we evacuate.

52:12.172 --> 52:13.422
Yes, sir.

52:27.104 --> 52:28.814
Identify yourself!

52:32.858 --> 52:34.527
Identify yourself!

52:40.741 --> 52:42.952
Doc, are you?

52:43.244 --> 52:44.788
It is a trap!

52:46.123 --> 52:47.415
Come on, fire!

53:03.222 --> 53:04.683
There are too many!

53:11.773 --> 53:13.482
Help us. We are overrun!

53:13.775 --> 53:17.069
There are new instructions, sir.
The homers change the location of the bomb.

53:17.069 --> 53:20.114
The coordinates are still open.
- Dranbleiben, Team Bravo.

53:20.114 --> 53:23.160
Sir, this is Bennett with medicine and food.
- Make him loud.

53:23.160 --> 53:25.870
Sgt. Bennett, return to
the base immediately.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.748
We are under attack.
I repeat: We are attacked.

53:28.748 --> 53:30.709
<i>Juchu, Colonel!</i>

53:31.208 --> 53:33.460
Rhys.
- They are encircled.

53:33.837 --> 53:36.922
I have the food, the
weapons, all the supplies.

53:36.922 --> 53:39.967
I also have hostages that
all hang on their lives.

53:39.967 --> 53:42.845
<i>But they will not be long if you
do not give me all the data</i>

53:42.845 --> 53:45.932
<i>And hand out devices that you
have received from the Homer.</i>

53:45.932 --> 53:49.393
What equipment?
- Do not do this, okay?

53:49.603 --> 53:51.479
Do not insult my intelligence.

53:52.105 --> 53:54.648
<i>They will give me everything.</i>

53:55.984 --> 53:59.153
Just ask how many bodies
are being piled up.

53:59.820 --> 54:04.074
We must now play for time. Getty, pack the
laptop. Tell them we are cooperating.

54:08.455 --> 54:11.082
Come on, come to the Alamo.

54:11.790 --> 54:13.459
Just courage, boy.

54:13.459 --> 54:15.587
<i>Have not I expressed
myself clearly enough?</i>

54:16.045 --> 54:19.632
They have 15 minutes to get
down and deliver the stuff.

54:19.632 --> 54:21.176
<i>Do not do that...</i>

54:21.468 --> 54:24.511
I will begin to
kill the wounded.

54:24.721 --> 54:27.431
For each <i> 5</i> minutes you
are going to be a.

54:31.228 --> 54:34.522
We can not stop them!
Pull back to the roof. Right now.

54:39.109 --> 54:42.112
Mark, here is Elias.
I'll come in now.

54:42.112 --> 54:44.031
Elias, stay where you are.
Do not get ringed.

54:44.031 --> 54:46.575
Repeat: Not allowed.
We are just being rolled over!

54:46.575 --> 54:48.661
<i>What does that mean?</i>
Where is the Colonel?

54:48.661 --> 54:50.579
He retreated to the
hiding-place delta.

54:50.579 --> 54:53.874
<i>The Alamo?</i> - Positive! This is <i> the
collection point. Go to him, Elias.</i>

54:58.671 --> 55:00.131
We are lost.

55:00.381 --> 55:01.882
Mark, do you understand me?

55:03.968 --> 55:06.054
Dock 2.
Everything replenished and ready.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.850
Go to hiding.
I'll give you cover.

55:19.943 --> 55:21.027
No!

55:22.654 --> 55:25.990
How about it, buddy?
Prepares much less pain.

55:26.199 --> 55:28.743
You are through. - Yes!

55:29.243 --> 55:30.869
Bone, what's up?

55:31.203 --> 55:32.789
We're inside, Rhys.

55:32.998 --> 55:35.959
<i>Outstanding.
Find the Colonel and take him to me.</i>

55:38.711 --> 55:41.756
What are you doing, you worm?
Where are you going?

55:43.466 --> 55:45.343
Where are the Hornet data?

55:46.386 --> 55:48.722
And where is the Colonel?
- I do not know that.

55:52.934 --> 55:54.602
In the hiding place in Little Tokyo.

55:56.061 --> 56:00.108
Get a city map. The little worm
will show us exactly where.

56:02.818 --> 56:05.864
<i>Am on the way to Alamo.
Instructions follow when I am there.</i>

56:32.389 --> 56:35.226
Here is Baker, 4-51,
on a safe channel.

56:35.434 --> 56:38.438
I am waiting for the transmission
of the final coordinates. Over.

56:39.064 --> 56:40.774
You stay here on
the radio, okay?

56:40.774 --> 56:42.317
Slick is a couple of psychos.

56:42.317 --> 56:45.736
We meet at the truck. - What happened?
- The Colonel, we must look for him.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.488
You come with.
- No. Leave me!

56:47.488 --> 56:48.781
Here we go!

57:15.558 --> 57:17.185
Well, let's go.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.815
Come on, get up!

57:22.815 --> 57:26.193
Come on, high! You want to live!
Come on, hurry!

57:28.613 --> 57:29.655
Fast!

57:30.781 --> 57:31.908
Do it already.

57:39.374 --> 57:42.293
All is well.
The drones can not see the truck.

57:42.293 --> 57:43.752
You are safe.

57:44.796 --> 57:47.965
Saint.
There is a doctor where we go.

57:47.965 --> 57:51.135
He cares for you, promised.
- Thank you. - Everything will be fine.

58:03.481 --> 58:05.899
<i>Transmission of the bomb
coordinates begins. Over.</i>

58:06.525 --> 58:08.777
Have understood. They arrive.

58:09.111 --> 58:10.655
They arrive.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.669
Go to hell!

58:39.057 --> 58:40.268
Colonel!

58:44.646 --> 58:49.027
Stay with me, sir.
- My cards are not good.

58:51.529 --> 58:53.490
What the hell was that?

58:53.823 --> 58:58.369
You tell me. They are getting
better by the minute.

58:59.203 --> 59:01.039
What was going on at the base?

59:01.872 --> 59:06.084
Rhys, he attacked the building.

59:06.878 --> 59:12.091
He took all of them as hostages.
- Damn, damn it!

59:13.718 --> 59:16.721
Do not worry. - No!
- I'll take you to the transport.

59:17.471 --> 59:19.224
Listen to me.

59:19.681 --> 59:22.059
I have the new coordinates.

59:22.894 --> 59:26.397
Everything you
need for the bomb.

59:26.647 --> 59:30.817
Still <2 hours of detonation.

59:32.946 --> 59:34.780
I know what I have to do.

59:35.156 --> 59:36.949
Yes, you always did.

59:37.158 --> 59:40.995
But please do not forget the people.

59:43.081 --> 59:47.835
Save as many as you can.
Get them off this Rhys.

59:47.835 --> 59:52.757
This scum.
Otherwise, they will not survive.

59:53.674 --> 59:55.217
Save her, boy.

59:56.552 --> 59:59.347
Otherwise everything was in vain.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.099
I will, sir.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.268
I promise. Just...

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.271
Colonel?

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:08.647
Colonel!

01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:37.302
Where is it, Elias?

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:43.098
The whole planet burns, if you do not know.
- Yes, I know.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.684
And what do you and
the Colonel do?

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.187
Wait until we're all torched?

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:50.814
Your wish came true.
The Colonel is dead.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:55.278
I'm sorry.
Fearful, probably.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:01:00.657
Or in the fight against drones.
Honorable. Not like you savages.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.119
Honor...
- Yes, honor.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.958
Honor.
Let's test it. Slick!

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:14.296
Hey! Always with Tranquillity.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.507
"Always with Tranquillity".
Why do you say that?

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:21.845
You and the Colonel are like one egg
to another. Behave like idiots!

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:25.140
That's just what mix you and me.
Let them run.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.518
It's clear. I let them run.

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:31.439
You pull out the Hornet's
stuff, and you'll get it.

01:01:32.357 --> 01:01:36.193
If you do not, I feed
her to the wolves.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:40.989
You can believe me,
there is not much left.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:50.207
Kate!

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:51.708
Elias!

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.921
Come!

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.218
They are one to me. This way.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.809
Come on, you bitch!

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.270
Sign up, Rhys.
Can you hear me?

01:02:13.064 --> 01:02:15.273
Rhys, where are you?

01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:17.276
Damn it.

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:20.404
And how is it?
- Unchanged.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:24.075
The last message was that they were entering
the hiding-place to intercept the Colonel.

01:02:24.075 --> 01:02:25.827
Minutes later, there
was a big shooting,

01:02:25.827 --> 01:02:29.204
Roar and then it was quiet.
- When was it? - 15 minutes ago.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:31.916
Sounds bad.

01:02:31.916 --> 01:02:35.920
Maybe what is with her radio?
- But maybe they're all torched.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.840
We should look for them. - No.

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:45.304
Bone says we should wait here. So we wait.
- You follow Bone's instructions?

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:47.055
I do not follow any instructions from anyone.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:49.475
I'm smart enough to know where
the wind is blowing from.

01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:51.977
And at the moment he is blowing
in the direction of Bone.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.979
So this means you'll
blow Bone one?

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.401
No.
This is your specialty.

01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:04.072
Fog a bit of your judgment...
- Maybe I'll stuff you in here.

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:05.657
Negligible tossicher deins.

01:03:09.078 --> 01:03:12.248
Perverse.
Maybe later.

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.585
<i>Look</i>

01:03:16.294 --> 01:03:20.255
When Rhys is out of the running,
the command falls to Bone.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:25.720
If I were you, I would
times the data pre-button,

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.890
Which they got from the
command center to find out,

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.975
What the Hornets plan.
- What do you think I'm doing, Judas?

01:03:32.185 --> 01:03:35.937
I think Bone knows you
are loyal to Rhys.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:39.524
In your place, I would soon begin
to make a good impression.

01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:44.446
For otherwise you may end up
like these poor pigs. Or worse.

01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:47.657
The Colonel probably took
valuable information.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.951
No...

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.955
He certainly wanted to distract us
from the really important things.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.916
I do not believe that.

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:58.084
The cries were different from the
usual fear-drones screaming.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.797
They sounded panicky.
They have met something completely new.

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:04.591
Whatever it is, it could be more valuable
than anything that is at our disposal.

01:04:07.345 --> 01:04:09.931
You're too secret, Zane.

01:04:12.183 --> 01:04:14.143
I tell Bone you're on board.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:21.441
With him we will bring it far.
You'll see.

01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:24.946
He even takes care
of our conversation

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:29.158
Such a Roman Colloseum's shit
For the common people.

01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:35.706
Do you understand?
This is how people are led.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.294
Do you know what, T.J.?
I'm still trying to reach Rhys.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.922
And if he is not dead,

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:48.260
How fast you pee to his leg.
Do not you think so?

01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:52.430
Anyway.

01:04:53.224 --> 01:04:55.016
I'm ready.

01:05:01.357 --> 01:05:06.152
Rhys, sign up. Do you hear me?
Rhys, please report!

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:13.786
Great cart.

01:05:14.704 --> 01:05:17.665
I have a patient for you.
Look for her.

01:05:23.504 --> 01:05:25.798
Low pulse. She needs blood.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.010
What's this?
- These are the coordinates.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.970
We have two hours left.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:32.429
The Hornets have built the bomb,

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.223
To put the mother
ships out of action.

01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:35.390
When one of those appears,

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.685
It will be a huge surprise.
Provided it works.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.689
Sounds like we do not have much time.
- Right, we did not.

01:05:41.689 --> 01:05:43.815
Then let's go.
Keep going. - Okay.

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.445
All who are ailing, to the wall.

01:05:48.905 --> 01:05:50.114
Come on!

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:57.162
Food only for soldiers.
You want to eat? Then fight against each other.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:01.292
Until death.
Whoever wins, survives.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:04.336
The other...
Ã ¢ â,¬Â¬reduced like dogs!

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.760
Have tried to reach Rhys.
War but also none.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:15.138
<i>Over. It's an emergency?
Do you understand me? Over.</i>

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:18.434
<i>Kate is talking about the medical
department. Does anyone hear me?</i>

01:06:18.934 --> 01:06:21.561
Here is Bone. Where is Rhys?

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.190
<i>Rhys and Slick were severely
wounded in a drones attack.</i>

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.943
<i>Your vehicle is completely destroyed.</i>

01:06:26.943 --> 01:06:29.570
<i>All the others are dead.
The drones hang on our ass,</i>

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:31.572
<i>And we race like the devil.
Go, open the gate!</i>

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:08.108
Come on, move!

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.155
Get the food out there and then get out of here.
- All out here. Come on.

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:14.322
Hey!

01:07:27.503 --> 01:07:29.295
Kate!

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:31.965
Away from here!

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:34.927
Come on, get out of here. Runt, Runt.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.387
Hurry, do it.

01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:40.141
Hurry, make it already!

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:56.198
I did not like the quarters anyway.
To be missed.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:58.992
You prefer your apartment...

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.412
Oh, keep it.
This is an even bigger dump.

01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:04.706
That was not always so.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:09.919
You mean you had someone?
- Yes, I had someone.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:16.093
She was one of them.
I tell you.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:18.178
Through it, the apartment was wonderful.

01:08:19.555 --> 01:08:22.057
She made a real home from it.

01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:27.520
If it had gone along, it would have
looked like a student's house.

01:08:29.398 --> 01:08:32.442
I lost them on the first
attack in the stadium.

01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:40.658
It was completely destroyed, full of
smoke, and I could not find it anywhere.

01:08:41.077 --> 01:08:45.747
I could hear them.
Listen, how she called for me and...

01:08:46.916 --> 01:08:51.294
Then this part of the stadium
is completely collapsed.

01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:57.216
Never seen her again.

01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.844
I'm sorry.

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:03.933
I know how it is
to lose someone.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:10.814
Yes, but if we lose this
fight, we lose everything.

01:09:13.943 --> 01:09:15.777
We do not lose.

01:09:34.505 --> 01:09:37.006
We are there! Get out!
- Come on. - Go into the house.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.051
Go to the house!

01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:40.678
Hurry up!

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:46.307
Look!

01:09:48.853 --> 01:09:51.563
I was not so close to a mother ship.
And you?

01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:54.149
Yes, closer than I liked.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:07.663
Find a room where we can
accommodate the wounded.

01:10:07.663 --> 01:10:09.372
And a room for the food.

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:12.709
I want to see how much we have.
- Looks like someone else

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.505
Everything prepared for us.
Why do not they do the same?

01:10:16.714 --> 01:10:18.716
Why the whole drill?
- Very easily:

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:21.343
We are not the only ones
fighting in this war.

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:24.679
If we fall out, someone will
continue where we stopped.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:25.972
Until there is no more.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.769
Is this a drone-tracking system?

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:34.230
Looks like that.
Considerably better than anything I've ever seen.

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:37.108
There it is. Exactly there.

01:10:38.903 --> 01:10:42.489
I want you to take me there.
To this exact place.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.450
And you do what?
- What is there?

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:47.328
This is the Sprengladung.

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.788
And what happens now?

01:10:51.624 --> 01:10:54.626
First, I take the
computer to me.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.630
And then I disappear.
- You're going back to town ?!

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.008
That's crazy!
- Someone has to stop them.

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:03.302
Otherwise we will lose the whole
city and all the people in it.

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:07.848
With all the technology here, we can
not ignite them? - Obviously not.

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:11.684
Getty, you have to take me there now.
I count on you.

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:13.437
Just no pressure.

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:18.275
Good work, Kate.
- Let me at least come along.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:19.860
No, not at all.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:23.363
I am a paramedic. So someone need you
there. - Does not matter at all.

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:26.658
No. I'm tired of losing people
who mean something to me.

01:11:26.658 --> 01:11:30.329
I do not want to lose you.
I'll do it alone and that's it.

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:33.332
Bring it to an end.

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.084
I will.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.927
Thank you.

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.475
I'll be right back.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.865
That's crazy.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:23.007
Here is Elias.
Do you hear me? Are you with me?

01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:27.052
<i>You hear K-RON, the
Apocalypse radio with yours</i>

01:12:27.052 --> 01:12:29.012
<i>Monday afternoon drama report.</i>

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.099
<i>Watch the sky, friends, and
take an umbrella with you.</i>

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:33.975
Very funny, Getty.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.611
This is not good.
Not good at all. Crap.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.072
<i>We have a lot of
electrical noise here.</i>

01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:49.574
You are our IT-Fritze.
Clear them.

01:12:49.825 --> 01:12:52.036
<i>For sure! I'm looking at the
end-of-the-world manual.</i>

01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:54.955
Do you see me on your screen?
- Have you.

01:12:54.955 --> 01:12:57.123
All right. Drive to tithing.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:13:00.419
This is exceptionally times free. And
you're in town, on the Temple to the Hill.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:03.212
But be careful.
Everywhere in the city are drones.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:04.757
Roger that.

01:13:12.264 --> 01:13:15.476
Where do the flashes come from?
This does not make any sense.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:25.903
Getty, here is Elias. Do you hear me?

01:13:25.903 --> 01:13:28.988
Getty! Report <i> you!</i>
- Elias, can you repeat it?

01:13:29.198 --> 01:13:30.948
<i>Out here...</i>

01:13:31.158 --> 01:13:33.410
Strong disturbances.
I can not understand you.

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.247
<i>... in trouble...</i>

01:13:37.581 --> 01:13:40.501
Elias, you have to go away.
Get off the road!

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.628
Getty?
Stupid shit. Such a crap.

01:13:44.505 --> 01:13:46.423
A few of them do not see me.

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:58.559
No no no no.
The sendemast is in the bucket!

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:05.691
<i>Fault in the stealth function.
Fault in the stealth function.</i>

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:08.027
Oh, no, no.
Not now, please.

01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:25.379
Come on...

01:14:27.381 --> 01:14:29.299
Just do not pay attention to me.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.261
What the hell are you doing?
They'll kill you.

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:34.179
And you too.

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:37.014
Watch out!

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.309
Calling back.

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.696
Hold it until I get the truck.

01:14:54.408 --> 01:14:56.617
Come on baby.
Go on, go on.

01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:01.331
He does not want to go.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.710
Forget it. We have to get out of here.

01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:09.255
Hurry!

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:13.509
Come on.

01:15:25.022 --> 01:15:28.483
The radio was still there.
- Do you also find the way?

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:30.944
For sure.

01:15:31.487 --> 01:15:32.945
But what?

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:02.016
Come over!
Holy shit. Look at this.

01:16:06.939 --> 01:16:08.607
This is damn tight.

01:16:11.902 --> 01:16:13.069
Come on.

01:16:15.197 --> 01:16:16.782
Where do you want to go?

01:16:17.491 --> 01:16:18.866
All right, I got it.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.461
Who are they?
- Finished! Is sharp.

01:16:41.223 --> 01:16:45.060
She was the chief of the Hornets.
We can do nothing more for them.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:47.354
Let's get out of here. - Elias!

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.410
The insects have made
us a great toy, right?

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:05.121
What, you're still alive? Come on.

01:17:05.956 --> 01:17:08.500
The game is over.
Let's get out of here.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:14.547
We drown anyway.
Look, age... Maybe the time is right.

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.718
Perhaps now is the
moment where we all go.

01:17:17.968 --> 01:17:20.887
This may be true for you,
but we both disappear.

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:24.599
No, you will not. Not today.

01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:28.227
Today we are all going to hell.

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.712
Go on. - Okay.

01:18:49.184 --> 01:18:51.185
There, you see? Done.

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:52.895
You did it!

01:18:58.944 --> 01:19:00.361
Oh my God!

01:19:17.087 --> 01:19:22.050
It's over.
- No. That's just the beginning.
