03:24.555 --> 03:26.430
No, Boss.

03:26.430 --> 03:27.763
No.

03:29.555 --> 03:32.305
I think it--
think it's hilarious.

04:52.971 --> 04:55.471
What the hell
is this?

04:57.847 --> 05:00.138
Yes.

05:00.138 --> 05:02.305
I've been a good boy.

05:02.305 --> 05:04.138
I behave.

05:07.513 --> 05:08.805
No.

05:10.388 --> 05:12.221
No, Monte Carlo.

05:13.388 --> 05:14.763
Same as 2008.

05:14.763 --> 05:16.388
I want that back.

05:17.638 --> 05:21.388
Give me another chance
to take it back.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.680
Huh?

That's what I want.

Well, if he can just
convert here, Pat,

he's hurt, Pat.

( video ends )

05:50.054 --> 05:52.388
( sighs )

05:52.388 --> 05:54.096
Still the same.

Still fucking same.

06:03.888 --> 06:05.971
( sighs )

06:05.971 --> 06:08.054
Keeping it together, Boss.

06:10.013 --> 06:11.847
Whatever you say.

06:13.305 --> 06:15.847
( speaking Croatian )

06:19.346 --> 06:21.346
The cortisone.

06:22.847 --> 06:24.096

Doc? Da?

06:44.096 --> 06:46.221
( shouting )

06:46.221 --> 06:50.054
Fuck Monte Carlo!
Keeping it together, Boss!

06:54.263 --> 06:57.263
Fucking Monte Carlo.

06:57.263 --> 06:59.555
( panting )

07:04.805 --> 07:07.346
It's time, Kimmy.

07:07.346 --> 07:09.430
Thank you, Kimmy,

07:09.430 --> 07:12.388
for being
such a good girl.

07:12.388 --> 07:15.138
How you have such
patience with me, huh?

07:16.471 --> 07:20.138
Living on the farm,
milking cows,

07:20.138 --> 07:24.388
in the field all day,
doing nothing.

07:24.388 --> 07:29.263
Must teach you to be
a good, good, patient girl.

07:34.179 --> 07:35.847
Kimmy, Kimmy.

07:39.221 --> 07:42.929
( chuckles )
You're so sexy, Kimmy.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.971
So fucking sexy.

07:44.971 --> 07:46.847
( growls )

07:47.971 --> 07:49.638
Relax.

07:49.638 --> 07:52.305
Kimmy.
( groans )

07:52.305 --> 07:55.722
Kimmy, you've got
such good moves.

07:55.722 --> 07:58.179
- ( grunting )
- ( knocking on door )

08:06.096 --> 08:07.722
Who's there?

08:07.722 --> 08:09.805
( knocking )

08:20.263 --> 08:22.971
- ( knocking )
- I'm coming!

08:36.054 --> 08:39.597
- Yes?
- Received many phone calls
complaining about smoke.

08:39.597 --> 08:41.013
It's against
management rules.

08:41.013 --> 08:43.096
Otherwise,
we'll charge you extra.

08:43.096 --> 08:44.388
How much extra?

08:44.388 --> 08:47.680
$200 for
the first offense,
more each time.

08:47.680 --> 08:51.096
- Sorry, what is your job?
- I clean.

08:51.096 --> 08:55.346
- Like a maid?
- Yes, I am a maid,
not like a maid.

08:55.346 --> 08:57.054
Sorry, I apologize.

08:57.054 --> 08:59.722
My-- my English
is shit.

08:59.722 --> 09:01.597
My brain is fucked.

09:03.513 --> 09:06.388
- That Santa shirt, I--
- Have you been naughty or nice?

09:06.388 --> 09:08.471
- Excuse me?
- Have you been
naughty or nice?

09:08.471 --> 09:10.430
- ( sighs )
- Sorry, do you believe
in Santa Claus?

09:10.430 --> 09:12.722
I'm gonna ask you
to please stop smoking

09:12.722 --> 09:14.597
or else we're gonna
ask you to leave...

09:15.763 --> 09:18.763
Sorry, okay?
So...

09:18.763 --> 09:22.263
- Well, you've been warned.
- Cocktail, señorita?

09:22.263 --> 09:24.513
I have to go
back to the office.

09:24.513 --> 09:27.597
Señorita,  wait, wait!
Por favor!

09:27.597 --> 09:29.597
Señorita.

09:29.597 --> 09:32.054
What's your name?
Please, I beg you.

09:32.054 --> 09:34.179
Look, I have
a very bad knee.

09:34.179 --> 09:35.929
Look at it.

09:35.929 --> 09:37.597
Please,
what's your name?

09:37.597 --> 09:39.138
Huh?

09:39.138 --> 09:41.763
I give you
$200 fine, okay?

09:41.763 --> 09:45.263
Plus another 100
to just talk.

09:45.263 --> 09:46.597
$300?

09:47.763 --> 09:49.054
And I put
my pants on.

09:49.054 --> 09:49.929
Please, don't go.

09:59.471 --> 10:01.763
What is your name?

10:01.763 --> 10:03.929
Rose.

10:03.929 --> 10:04.929
Huh?

10:06.305 --> 10:07.638
I'm Boris.

10:10.805 --> 10:12.388
Boris. See?

10:12.388 --> 10:15.138
My father gave me this
when I was little.

10:15.138 --> 10:19.013
Before Vukovar, you know,
the massacre.

10:21.971 --> 10:25.471
Gonna be a lot
of unhappy children left
in this world, I tell you.

10:25.471 --> 10:27.555
Santa Claus
fucking quit.

10:27.555 --> 10:30.888
I'm sorry.
I was cleaning up and I had
a phone call from my son.

10:30.888 --> 10:32.971
Another guest
left that Santa suit.

10:32.971 --> 10:34.971
Must be freezing
his nuts off.
There it is.

10:34.971 --> 10:37.805
I-- I apologize
for the inconvenience.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.638
No, it's-- it's cool.

10:39.638 --> 10:41.096
Don't worry
about stupid shit.

10:41.096 --> 10:43.430
Well, my boss
could fire me for that.

10:43.430 --> 10:45.638
He's not nice to you,
your boss?

10:45.638 --> 10:49.430
( sighs, scoffs )
No. It's okay, it's a job.

10:49.430 --> 10:52.388
Eh, sorry about that,
you know?

10:52.388 --> 10:54.138
I can take
the Santa suit.

10:54.138 --> 10:55.513
You know, Dumpster's
around the back.

10:55.513 --> 10:57.430
- What?
- The Santa suit.

10:57.430 --> 11:00.054
No, you don't take it away.
You don't take it away.

11:00.054 --> 11:02.054
It's my--
he's my new friend.

11:04.763 --> 11:06.179
You know,
this room was a mess.

11:06.179 --> 11:07.638
Took me three hours
to clean it up.

11:07.638 --> 11:10.305
Presents and boxes
everywhere.

11:10.305 --> 11:12.597
Sorry. You know,
it just--

11:12.597 --> 11:14.847
Rose, have a drink
with me.

11:14.847 --> 11:16.888
Boss is not here.

11:16.888 --> 11:19.638
- You can have one drink.
- Not allowed.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.971
Of course
you are allowed!

11:21.971 --> 11:25.013
Of course you are!
It's your life, Rose.

11:25.013 --> 11:26.388
You live one time.

11:26.388 --> 11:28.430
You have to be able
to do what you must.

11:28.430 --> 11:32.388
You know, like,
just relax, have a drink!

11:32.388 --> 11:35.221
- One drink, I beg you.
- I can't, I--

11:35.221 --> 11:38.929
If your boss come,
we'll tell him I kidnapped you,
hold you against your will.

11:38.929 --> 11:40.388
That's it.

11:40.388 --> 11:41.888
Yeah?

11:41.888 --> 11:44.054
Okay, so...

11:45.971 --> 11:49.221
I ask you a question
and you have to answer

11:49.221 --> 11:51.722
with the first thing
that comes to your mind.

11:51.722 --> 11:53.221
- See?
- Okay.

11:53.221 --> 11:57.722
Okay. Rose, the one thing
you want most in your life.

11:59.888 --> 12:01.555
My green card.

12:03.221 --> 12:05.888
- A green card?
- Well, it's everything to me.

12:05.888 --> 12:09.263
- Why everything?
- ( sighs )

12:09.263 --> 12:11.597
If I get it,
I'll feel safe, okay?

12:11.597 --> 12:13.263
( chuckles )
You're not safe now?

12:13.263 --> 12:15.971
( scoffs )
I'm a Mexican
living in the US.

12:15.971 --> 12:17.722
I'm a slave.

12:17.722 --> 12:20.263
They can take me away
from my son any time.

12:22.929 --> 12:25.680
( sighs )
I love Mexico.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.597
( chuckles )
Been there?

12:27.597 --> 12:29.179
Acapulco.

12:29.179 --> 12:30.971
Papaya margarita!

12:30.971 --> 12:34.013
- ( chuckles ) So good!
- You know, that's not
real Mexico.

12:34.013 --> 12:36.263
- What's real Mexico?
- That's hotel Mexico.

12:36.263 --> 12:38.221
That's Mexico for
the pinches gringos.

12:40.221 --> 12:42.805
It should not be something
you need to worry about.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.597
- What?
- ( sniffs )

12:44.597 --> 12:46.263
Getting kicked out
of the USA.

12:47.471 --> 12:49.638
- No.
- No, Rose.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.221
Hell, no!
Hell, no, Rose!

12:52.221 --> 12:54.805
Hell, no!
Hell, no, motherfucker!

12:54.805 --> 12:58.471
Not in this lifetime!
Not in this motherfucking time!

12:58.471 --> 13:01.346
Not on my fucking watch,
motherfucker!

13:01.346 --> 13:04.430
Motherfuckers!
( panting )

13:05.638 --> 13:07.138
( chuckles )

13:07.138 --> 13:09.138
Fuck them!

13:11.305 --> 13:14.096
What do you do
for a living?

13:17.471 --> 13:20.096
( sniffs )
You don't know me?

13:20.096 --> 13:23.597
- Should I?
- In my country, I'm famous.

13:23.597 --> 13:27.013
Oh, famous.
( chuckles )

13:27.013 --> 13:29.179
And is this good,
being famous, for you?

13:32.013 --> 13:34.013
( sighs )

13:34.013 --> 13:35.638
Not so far.

13:37.388 --> 13:39.013
What are you famous for?

13:40.179 --> 13:43.179
I play sport.
Tennis.

13:43.179 --> 13:46.013
- ( sucks teeth )
- A pro athlete?

13:46.013 --> 13:48.054
Mm, yeah.

13:48.054 --> 13:50.555
( hiccups )

13:50.555 --> 13:54.346
I-- I played a--

13:54.346 --> 13:56.680
I played a tournament
today, you know?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.763
Mm.

13:58.763 --> 14:01.179
But I lost.
I lost.

14:01.179 --> 14:03.597
( sighs )

14:03.597 --> 14:05.638
First round.
( snorts )

14:07.179 --> 14:09.054
Mm-hmm.

14:12.346 --> 14:15.263
I lose
all the time, Rose.

14:18.221 --> 14:20.597
I let everybody down.

14:31.221 --> 14:34.221
( speaking Croatian )

14:34.221 --> 14:36.388
Huh?

14:36.388 --> 14:40.096
"Boris.
Boris, you win!

14:40.096 --> 14:42.388
You win for them,
Boris!"

14:42.388 --> 14:46.179
( speaking Croatian )

14:52.096 --> 14:54.263
I can't, aef...

14:54.263 --> 14:56.888
( sobbing )

14:58.597 --> 15:00.263
I can't fucking...

15:00.263 --> 15:03.138
Okay? I can't.
I fucking can't.

15:03.138 --> 15:05.430
It's-- I do
what I can do.

15:05.430 --> 15:08.971
What can I do?
What the fuck do
you want me to do?

15:08.971 --> 15:11.305
I can't...

15:11.305 --> 15:12.763
Fucking...

15:14.096 --> 15:16.680
I fucking can't
fucking win!

15:16.680 --> 15:17.847
You-- fuck you!

15:17.847 --> 15:20.430
Fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you!

15:22.471 --> 15:25.597
( crying )

15:31.805 --> 15:34.763
I'm supposed to win.
I'm supposed to.

15:34.763 --> 15:38.221
People-- people
depend on me.

15:38.221 --> 15:40.555
These--
( sobbing )

15:40.555 --> 15:42.305
I can't win.

15:42.305 --> 15:43.680
I can't.

15:50.638 --> 15:53.179
( coughing )

15:54.971 --> 15:56.805
( coughing )

15:59.929 --> 16:02.471
Oh. Oh!

16:02.471 --> 16:06.305
Oh, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna be sick.

16:06.305 --> 16:09.263
( vomiting, coughing )

16:12.179 --> 16:14.346
( coughing )

16:19.929 --> 16:21.888
( panting )

16:25.555 --> 16:28.013
( groaning )

16:34.179 --> 16:36.346
( whimpers )

16:36.346 --> 16:38.638
( gunfire, explosions )

16:40.263 --> 16:42.263
( gunfire, explosions
continue )

16:42.263 --> 16:43.680
( man speaking Croatian )

16:45.179 --> 16:46.346
I'm running.

16:46.346 --> 16:47.513
( gunfire )

16:47.513 --> 16:49.555
Uncle!

16:49.555 --> 16:52.722
- ( speaking Croatian )
- ( man shouting in Croatian )

16:56.263 --> 16:58.221
( baby crying )

16:58.221 --> 17:00.054
( imitates gunfire )

17:00.054 --> 17:02.305
( speaking Croatian )

17:02.305 --> 17:03.805
Do bazenu!

17:03.805 --> 17:05.346
Bazenu sam!

17:05.346 --> 17:06.722
Ja bazenu sam!

17:23.388 --> 17:24.722
( sighs )

17:27.888 --> 17:29.555
Good morning, Boris.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.388
What happened?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.805
You were very sick
last night.

17:37.805 --> 17:39.555
Oh.

17:39.555 --> 17:41.430
What--
what time is it?

17:41.430 --> 17:42.388
7:00.

17:46.638 --> 17:48.305
( grunts )

17:56.929 --> 18:00.929
Boris,
what's a bazenu?

18:00.929 --> 18:06.263
You kept yelling,
"Bazenu, bazenu."

18:06.263 --> 18:08.929
( sighs )

18:08.929 --> 18:10.638
Huh.

18:15.597 --> 18:17.430
Bazenu,  huh?

18:21.971 --> 18:23.638
I was...

18:24.929 --> 18:28.138
I was six
when the Serbs came.

18:28.138 --> 18:29.597
I'll never forget.

18:31.221 --> 18:35.346
My uncle was teaching me
to play tennis
to become star.

18:35.346 --> 18:37.430
Age five.
( chuckles )

18:39.138 --> 18:44.680
There was no tennis court
near where we lived.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.971
But there was
a pool, bazenu.

18:47.971 --> 18:51.805
You know, empty.
No water.

18:51.805 --> 18:53.971
So he taught me
to play in it.

18:56.471 --> 19:01.179
And then when planes
came with bombs,

19:01.179 --> 19:04.680
we drilled a hole
in it and, uh--

19:04.680 --> 19:07.847
hole in the middle
and made it into shelter...

19:07.847 --> 19:09.054
( sniffs )

19:10.138 --> 19:12.805
...so I could hide in it.

19:12.805 --> 19:15.513
We could hear them,
you know, dropping overhead.

19:21.013 --> 19:23.555
So bazenu  saved me.

19:25.013 --> 19:26.722
My uncle saved me.

19:28.138 --> 19:30.138
Tennis saved me.

19:32.847 --> 19:37.054
My cousins,
my parents...

19:41.680 --> 19:44.680
they-- they were taken.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.471
They were put on a bus,

19:47.471 --> 19:50.888
taken to a farm,
and then...

19:50.888 --> 19:52.847
they killed them.

20:03.096 --> 20:05.346
So, your uncle
is the boss?

20:08.430 --> 20:10.388
He took me in, he...

20:11.888 --> 20:15.388
kept me fed, took me
to Russia to train.

20:17.388 --> 20:20.680
( sucks teeth )
I play tennis to try
and pay them back.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.763
But fail.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.680
( chuckles )

20:32.680 --> 20:37.013
Either I dream
or I so drunk last night.

20:37.013 --> 20:40.096
( chuckles )
You were very
drunk last night.

20:40.096 --> 20:43.179
No, I-- in my dream...

20:43.179 --> 20:45.763
- Mm.
- I... ( chuckles )

20:47.263 --> 20:51.179
I was-- I was giving
a lot of toys

20:51.179 --> 20:54.555
to kids, you know,
children.

20:55.805 --> 20:57.929
They were smiling,
laughing.

20:57.929 --> 21:00.929
( both chuckling )

21:00.929 --> 21:03.305
I was Santa.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.430
It made me so happy.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.430
Mm.

21:09.763 --> 21:12.138
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.305
- What?
- Your family.

21:15.305 --> 21:16.471
Lo siento.

21:23.805 --> 21:25.847
No one's ever
said that.

21:32.805 --> 21:34.597
We don't talk
about them.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.263
You know,
Boss's rules.

21:37.888 --> 21:39.513
( sniffles )

21:43.513 --> 21:46.305
- Salud, señorita.
- ( chuckles )

21:48.471 --> 21:50.430
- ( knocking on door )
- ( sighs )

21:50.430 --> 21:52.305
If that's my boss,
I have to hide.

21:52.305 --> 21:55.847
Mm, I cover for you.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.971
- Who is it?
- Man: My name is Edgar.

22:01.847 --> 22:03.263
I'm so-- I'm sorry
to bother you,

22:03.263 --> 22:06.555
but I stayed here
the night before last

22:06.555 --> 22:08.430
and I think I forgot
something in my room.

22:08.430 --> 22:12.054
I tried calling
the front desk,
but there was no answer.

22:12.054 --> 22:14.847
What, um--
what are you looking for?

22:14.847 --> 22:17.263
It's a red Santa suit.

22:17.263 --> 22:21.013
I was in a hurry
to get to my next gig
and I just forgot it.

22:21.013 --> 22:23.013
Shucks, I was
already on the bus

22:23.013 --> 22:25.929
halfway to Tippecanoe
when I remembered, so I--

22:25.929 --> 22:29.388
well, I thought I'd just
come by this morning,
give it a shot.

22:29.388 --> 22:31.805
- Is this your Santa suit?
- Oh, yes.

22:31.805 --> 22:35.054
- Rose: I see.
- These things are
really expensive.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.471
Otherwise,
I'd have a backup.

22:36.471 --> 22:39.638
I'd hate to
have to replace it.

22:39.638 --> 22:42.054
Sure, of course.
Here.

22:42.054 --> 22:44.929
You see,
Boris here would like
to buy it from you.

22:44.929 --> 22:47.597
- Do you think
that's possible?
- Oh, I-- I'm sorry.

22:47.597 --> 22:49.305
It-- it's not for sale.

22:49.305 --> 22:52.847
I had it specially fit
for my fat butt.
( chuckles )

22:52.847 --> 22:54.263
( all chuckling )

22:54.263 --> 22:57.096
Are you sure?
$300.

22:57.096 --> 22:59.054
No, I wish I could,

22:59.054 --> 23:01.929
but I have a bunch of kids
that are counting on me.

23:03.388 --> 23:04.722
It's okay.

23:06.638 --> 23:08.555
Much obliged.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.971
Merry Christmas, folks.

23:13.638 --> 23:14.763
( chuckles )

23:19.638 --> 23:21.763
Can I buy you coffee?

23:21.763 --> 23:23.221
I have to
pick up my son.

23:23.221 --> 23:24.971
- What's his name?
- Jesus.

23:24.971 --> 23:28.013
- "Hey, Zeus"?
- Yeah, spelled like Jesus.

23:28.013 --> 23:30.054
Ah, cool, cool,
cool, cool.

23:30.054 --> 23:32.471
- So I met Jesus's mom.
- ( chuckles )

23:35.638 --> 23:38.888
Well, good luck,
Boris.

23:38.888 --> 23:40.722
Hey, Rose.

23:42.179 --> 23:45.471
Here, one second.

23:45.471 --> 23:48.805
For Jesus.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.430
Even if
he'll never play,

23:51.430 --> 23:54.221
at least it will make
a good story, you know?

23:54.221 --> 23:56.638
It's okay,
you don't have to
give us anything.

23:56.638 --> 23:59.763
Rose.
( sighs )

23:59.763 --> 24:00.971
You helped me.

24:00.971 --> 24:02.971
I don't know
what to say.

24:06.138 --> 24:08.263
Goes on your shoulder.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.680
( chuckles )

24:22.221 --> 24:24.305
( door closes )

24:24.305 --> 24:26.513
( sniffles, sighs )

24:38.555 --> 24:40.847
( music playing )

24:59.096 --> 25:01.971
Time to go back

do you do it?

FEMALE REPORTER: More than
a majority of voters say

26:48.388 --> 26:50.805
they simply cannot
imagine him as president.
