00:25.496 --> 00:26.967
Strike them out.

00:27.067 --> 00:29.097
You can do it, baby.

00:31.001 --> 00:32.770
Alright, keep your eye on the ball.

00:33.470 --> 00:35.420
- Strike!
- Good job.

00:39.576 --> 00:41.308
Let's go. You got that.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.714
Griffin, let's go.

00:45.849 --> 00:48.252
Stay focused. Eyes on the batter.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.983
- Watch the batter.
- Fielders get ready.

00:51.222 --> 00:53.355
Look straight, hon.

00:55.192 --> 00:58.102
- Strike 2!
- Yeah, nice goin'.

00:59.897 --> 01:01.115
You got it.

01:01.215 --> 01:04.899
Good job, Bobby. Good job.

01:08.304 --> 01:09.940
Right over the plate. There you go.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.207
One more. Come on.

01:13.143 --> 01:14.210
You got it.

01:25.388 --> 01:28.616
- Bobby?
- Please, let me through. I'm his mom.

01:28.716 --> 01:30.361
Let me through.

01:30.461 --> 01:32.863
Bobby? Please go call
an ambulance. Please.

01:32.963 --> 01:36.431
Bobby, you need to breathe.
Please breathe. Please just...

01:41.070 --> 01:44.224
- How are his vitals?
- He's crashing.

02:11.734 --> 02:14.105
Your son is going to be okay.

02:14.205 --> 02:18.846
Thank you, Dr. Young.
Thank you for savin' my boy.

04:32.841 --> 04:35.977
<i>Is no longer available
to take your call.</i>

04:49.725 --> 04:52.694
- Baby?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.663
Did you get out of bed?

05:00.170 --> 05:03.772
A bird was eating my corn and I...
I had to scare it off.

05:04.941 --> 05:08.142
Breathe for me. Deep breath.

05:09.513 --> 05:11.379
And again.

05:14.483 --> 05:17.010
I don't like how you sound.

05:32.301 --> 05:33.684
Hey.

05:35.605 --> 05:38.409
Can I just say I hate doctors?

05:38.509 --> 05:42.789
This guy today, made me wait
for over an hour to sign off on my samples

05:42.889 --> 05:45.182
and then acts like I'm wasting his time.

05:45.282 --> 05:47.351
What's the difference
between God and a doctor?

05:47.451 --> 05:48.920
I don't know. What?

05:49.820 --> 05:51.855
God doesn't think he's a doctor.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.838
So...

05:58.655 --> 05:59.767
how's he feeling?

06:00.930 --> 06:03.083
He's tough, but he's getting weaker.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.302
What's the plan?

06:05.402 --> 06:08.705
She's got him
on this new medicine regimen.

06:08.805 --> 06:10.774
That's why I've been
bothering you so much.

06:10.874 --> 06:15.445
It's no bother.
I like coming here to see you.

06:15.545 --> 06:17.654
I just wanna help you get through this.

06:17.754 --> 06:20.189
It kills me to see him...

06:20.551 --> 06:25.055
sitting there in that little room
while his life passes him by.

06:35.965 --> 06:37.134
Better?

06:37.234 --> 06:40.735
I'm still a little tired
but I feel... I feel fine.

06:46.308 --> 06:48.476
Get some rest.

06:59.422 --> 07:03.494
Is he having any seizures?
You know, because this is...

07:03.594 --> 07:06.897
She's got his treatment plan
all worked out.

07:06.997 --> 07:10.898
Okay. I'm sure she does. But...

07:10.998 --> 07:15.072
this is an adult dosage,
so please be very careful.

07:15.172 --> 07:19.307
Well, thanks for doing this.
It takes a lot of pressure off of me.

07:20.576 --> 07:22.412
Your welcome.

07:22.512 --> 07:26.431
I just am happy to help you.
Help... help your son.

07:39.128 --> 07:41.164
And destroy the box bottoms
if you could.

07:41.264 --> 07:44.201
They have the lot numbers on 'em
that can trace back to me.

07:44.301 --> 07:46.770
I'll be in the city soon,
so I'll give you a call.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.636
Okay.

08:06.123 --> 08:08.990
Come on, honey. We're here.

08:10.526 --> 08:14.161
Maryann, wake up. We're home.

08:26.842 --> 08:30.179
- You're gonna hurt your back.
- No. I got this.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.013
Damn.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.888
I guess she does take after her father.

08:37.988 --> 08:42.090
I hope not. I don't think I have
enough energy for that.

08:50.032 --> 08:53.334
We ordered you a new mattress.
It'll be here soon.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.274
When are my friends being shipped here?

08:57.374 --> 08:58.709
Oh, yeah, your friends.

08:58.809 --> 09:01.978
Well, there's not a lot
of room here for them.

09:02.078 --> 09:04.812
We left the computer however.

09:06.549 --> 09:08.385
You start school on Monday.

09:08.485 --> 09:11.952
You're gonna meet
a whole bunch of new friends.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.325
I liked my old friends.

09:16.418 --> 09:19.493
I'll go get the rest of your stuff
from the back of the car.

09:24.934 --> 09:27.138
We know it's hard.

09:28.438 --> 09:31.022
We miss your parents too.

09:47.990 --> 09:50.224
Keep your bones strong.

09:54.864 --> 09:58.902
I'm sorry, it took longer
than I expected.

09:59.002 --> 10:02.036
Well, wash up. We're ready to eat.

10:27.129 --> 10:29.264
Andy, your napkin.

10:46.348 --> 10:49.991
Sorry. Excuse me.

10:50.352 --> 10:52.322
It's the hospital.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.331
Hello?

10:54.431 --> 10:56.156
Hi.

11:02.198 --> 11:05.802
- Where'd you go today?
- I had to meet up with an old friend.

11:05.902 --> 11:09.537
- Someone you used to work with?
- Yeah.

11:11.473 --> 11:15.309
- Another nurse?
- Yeah. Something like that.

11:16.612 --> 11:19.683
- What did you do? Homework?
- Mom didn't think I was feeling up to it.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.886
She gave me a pass.
So I know she won't flunk me.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.175
I wouldn't put it past her.

11:28.791 --> 11:31.859
Don't repeat that.
You'll get me in trouble.

11:36.498 --> 11:38.836
- I have to pee.
- You need help?

11:40.036 --> 11:41.083
No.

12:01.724 --> 12:04.759
- Where'd he go?
- Bathroom.

12:06.495 --> 12:07.433
Alone?

12:08.565 --> 12:09.733
He'll be fine.

12:12.434 --> 12:14.771
What took you so long anyway?

12:14.871 --> 12:17.107
Sandra was like...

12:17.307 --> 12:20.043
She gave us a good amount, though.
It should last a while.

12:20.143 --> 12:23.614
Well, we'll see, because I had
to increase his dosage again today.

12:24.014 --> 12:27.849
- She said to watch how much you give him.
- I don't need advice from a drug rep.

12:30.953 --> 12:33.157
- She was just...
- She's just what?

12:33.857 --> 12:36.693
Now, you tell her
I've got it under control.

12:36.793 --> 12:38.526
I'm the doctor.

12:51.241 --> 12:52.255
Mom!

12:53.443 --> 12:55.276
Mom!

13:03.052 --> 13:04.888
I'm sorry.

13:04.988 --> 13:08.358
- I lost my balance.
- It's okay.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.991
Looks like the bleeding stopped.

13:15.197 --> 13:17.166
Alright, Andy.

13:17.266 --> 13:20.060
This is gonna sting, okay?

13:27.910 --> 13:30.074
You're in my light.

13:35.318 --> 13:37.454
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

13:37.554 --> 13:41.021
- You want more cream?
- No, no. I'm okay.

13:52.768 --> 13:55.639
I'm sorry he let you go alone.

13:55.739 --> 13:58.041
It was my idea.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.009
I wanted to go alone...

14:00.109 --> 14:02.678
'cause I need to build my strength up.

14:04.146 --> 14:05.782
Okay.

14:05.882 --> 14:07.981
We're all done here.

14:10.753 --> 14:13.089
Alright, you can clean him up.

14:13.189 --> 14:15.425
Will I be able to go outside
and play catch?

14:15.525 --> 14:17.961
I don't think so. No.

14:18.261 --> 14:19.396
Dad promised.

14:19.496 --> 14:22.129
Well, that was before he let you
crack your head open.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.735
I'm going to get you
some antibiotics, okay?

14:30.639 --> 14:33.974
Congratulations on your first set
of stitches.

14:35.711 --> 14:37.913
It wasn't that bad.

15:03.874 --> 15:07.775
Maryann, don't go too far.
I'm fixing lunch.

17:50.205 --> 17:52.907
- Did you get everything?
- Whatever was on the list.

17:54.510 --> 17:58.479
- You didn't even check on him.
- How could I? I just walked in.

18:01.984 --> 18:04.621
- He had a bad morning.
- What happened?

18:04.721 --> 18:09.089
- He couldn't breathe.
- Well, that's a side effect of the dosage.

18:11.260 --> 18:14.462
- No, I want to stay aggressive.
- Oh, dammit!

18:15.397 --> 18:17.600
Why are you mad at me?

18:17.900 --> 18:20.034
You undermine everything I say.

18:21.069 --> 18:23.106
I really don't understand you sometimes.

18:23.206 --> 18:26.741
You keep pushing me away,
and I'm all you've got.

18:28.377 --> 18:30.420
I'm sorry.

18:31.581 --> 18:34.614
I just... I just want him to get better.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.796
I know.

18:51.032 --> 18:52.833
Me too.

19:03.745 --> 19:05.679
How is your head?

19:06.548 --> 19:08.701
It doesn't hurt now. I'm just tired.

19:11.888 --> 19:15.956
- You've played enough for today.
- Just one more inning left.

19:23.065 --> 19:26.500
- You two okay?
- We're fine.

19:32.474 --> 19:34.976
- Andy, you need anything?
- No.

19:38.647 --> 19:40.514
Sleeve.

19:54.730 --> 19:56.808
Look at me.

19:59.634 --> 20:02.340
This will make you feel a lot better.

20:02.639 --> 20:04.438
Okay?

20:27.562 --> 20:29.832
You had a long sleep.

20:29.932 --> 20:32.213
I'm still tired.

20:33.902 --> 20:36.836
Getting better takes a lot out of you.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.423
Can I go outside today?

20:43.912 --> 20:46.346
You have enough stitches in your head.

20:47.716 --> 20:50.587
- I have to go out.
- Okay.

20:50.687 --> 20:55.091
But later on...
we'll do some school work.

20:55.191 --> 20:56.793
I can't wait.

20:57.193 --> 21:00.530
If you don't study,
you'll grow up to be a nurse.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.839
- Like Dad?
- Exactly.

21:45.774 --> 21:47.642
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:50.466 --> 21:52.557
I like your room.

21:54.449 --> 21:56.542
Nice toys.

21:57.086 --> 22:00.958
They're... they're collector's items.
I don't actually play with them.

22:01.758 --> 22:04.026
You should've kept them
in the package then.

22:04.126 --> 22:06.470
They'd be worth more.

22:08.387 --> 22:10.865
So do you live around here?

22:12.267 --> 22:13.555
Yeah.

22:16.471 --> 22:18.574
Do you want me to come in?

22:18.674 --> 22:20.473
Alright.

22:26.314 --> 22:28.348
You okay?

22:31.119 --> 22:33.223
You can't walk?

22:33.623 --> 22:35.992
I'll be able to soon.

22:36.092 --> 22:38.525
Just have to get stronger.

22:39.861 --> 22:44.042
- Can I sit in it or is that weird?
- Go ahead.

22:51.072 --> 22:52.648
I'm Maryann.

22:53.309 --> 22:54.544
Andy.

22:54.844 --> 22:58.779
I'm new, so... I guess
you're my first friend.

23:00.415 --> 23:04.151
I've lived here all my life
and you're my first friend too.

23:05.654 --> 23:08.591
There's no other kids
around here at all?

23:08.691 --> 23:12.628
- None that I know.
- What about school?

23:12.728 --> 23:14.758
I don't go to school.

23:15.264 --> 23:18.732
You're lucky. I start tomorrow.

23:20.201 --> 23:22.802
You wanna play Xbox?

23:24.306 --> 23:26.876
<i>One, one pitch.</i>

23:27.076 --> 23:28.628
<i>Price with strike 2.</i>

23:28.728 --> 23:32.548
- That was outside.
- It caught the outside corner.

23:32.648 --> 23:36.817
- No way.
- Can't argue with the computer.

23:42.190 --> 23:44.627
Andy, what's going on here?

23:44.727 --> 23:47.063
- This is Maryann.
- Hi.

23:47.163 --> 23:48.464
That's bull.

23:48.564 --> 23:51.601
Hi, Maryann. How did you get in here?

23:51.901 --> 23:53.837
- I let her in.
- The window.

23:54.937 --> 23:57.673
It was nice to meet you, Maryann.

23:57.773 --> 24:00.019
We're not finished playing.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.047
Okay.

24:07.449 --> 24:08.626
Bye, Andy.

24:09.417 --> 24:10.653
Bye.

24:10.753 --> 24:14.423
- Thanks for having me over, Mrs....
- Dr. Young.

24:14.523 --> 24:17.357
- Take care, Maryann.
- Bye.

24:21.997 --> 24:24.033
Who was that?

24:24.633 --> 24:26.456
Maryann.

24:27.736 --> 24:31.305
When I leave you in charge would you actually
mind checking on him once in a while?

24:32.841 --> 24:33.943
I did. He was fine.

24:34.043 --> 24:37.013
But you were completely unaware
that he had somebody in this house.

24:37.113 --> 24:38.618
I didn't let her in.

24:39.048 --> 24:41.083
I know.

24:41.183 --> 24:43.250
You're oblivious.

25:12.247 --> 25:15.448
I've never seen
a school bus go by before.

25:16.885 --> 25:20.153
Show me again how you got to this point.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.960
Today was her first day.

25:29.030 --> 25:30.434
Great.

25:51.719 --> 25:53.756
How was school today?

25:53.856 --> 25:56.123
Your bed came.

26:16.111 --> 26:19.815
- I'm going out to play.
- Dinner is in 1 hour. 5 o'clock.

26:19.915 --> 26:20.983
I know.

26:46.975 --> 26:48.003
Hey.

26:49.677 --> 26:52.513
My mom doesn't like strangers
coming in through the window.

27:09.864 --> 27:12.067
Hi, Mr. Young.

27:13.268 --> 27:15.371
You must be Maryann.

27:15.671 --> 27:19.376
- Can Andy play for a little while?
- He's sleepin'.

27:20.076 --> 27:24.011
No, he's... he's awake.
I saw him through the window.

27:27.482 --> 27:31.523
Well, I guess if he's awake
you can come in for a little bit.

27:44.566 --> 27:48.574
See, he is asleep.
You should let him rest.

27:48.838 --> 27:50.878
He's faking it.

27:57.212 --> 27:59.202
You're a jerk.

27:59.848 --> 28:01.851
That's where I get my shots.

28:01.951 --> 28:03.553
Oh, sorry.

28:03.853 --> 28:07.189
So I heard the school bus
go by today. How was it?

28:07.389 --> 28:09.025
The worst.

28:09.125 --> 28:12.395
When do you go back to school?
When you're better?

28:12.495 --> 28:17.131
- I don't. I'm home schooled.
- You're so lucky. That school sucks.

28:20.568 --> 28:24.206
- I wish I could go to regular school.
- You're not missing anything,

28:24.306 --> 28:27.610
but I guess you must get bored
just sitting here all day.

28:27.710 --> 28:30.647
I want to learn
how to play baseball but...

28:31.247 --> 28:34.294
- my mom won't let me.
- What's the big deal?

28:36.718 --> 28:39.522
She's worried. I'm getting weaker.

28:39.622 --> 28:43.826
- What's with the garden?
- It's my corn. I watch it grow.

28:44.026 --> 28:47.360
Oh, and I thought
you weren't having any fun.

28:49.665 --> 28:52.914
I have to keep the birds away
or else they'll eat it.

28:54.536 --> 28:57.039
Well, maybe we can just put
something there to scare them off.

28:57.639 --> 29:00.542
I can just tap on the glass
and they fly away.

29:00.642 --> 29:02.845
What about a scarecrow?

29:02.945 --> 29:04.780
Nah.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.082
Let's just play baseball.

29:07.182 --> 29:12.270
Fine, but... I'm not going easy on you
just 'cause you're on a wheelchair.

29:24.465 --> 29:26.441
Here you go.

29:31.606 --> 29:34.176
- What inning?
- Top of the 7th.

29:34.676 --> 29:36.609
A stretch.

29:47.922 --> 29:50.526
Let's finish this game
and call it a day, okay?

29:50.626 --> 29:53.961
Okay, Mr. Young. Thank you.

30:03.805 --> 30:06.334
How are you feeling today?

30:10.144 --> 30:13.051
I'm gonna run a few more tests, okay?

30:43.377 --> 30:45.858
Hey, look at me for a sec.

30:47.064 --> 30:49.118
You've got that look in your eyes.

30:49.218 --> 30:51.217
No, I don't.

30:52.053 --> 30:55.924
I had that look, your father had it.

30:56.024 --> 30:58.157
You're up to something.

31:00.795 --> 31:03.088
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:11.372 --> 31:13.018
Far out.

31:45.606 --> 31:49.362
- Is... is Andy home?
- Yes, of course Andy's home.

31:50.778 --> 31:53.769
We're gonna make a scarecrow.
It'll keep the birds away.

31:53.869 --> 31:55.944
I know what a scarecrow does.

31:57.618 --> 32:01.190
Okay, well... could you please
tell Andy that I came by?

32:01.290 --> 32:03.258
'Cause, I don't want him
to think that...

32:03.358 --> 32:05.391
Goodbye, Maryann.

32:17.138 --> 32:19.623
Where do you think he should go?

32:20.109 --> 32:22.675
Just... right... right at the edge.

32:23.444 --> 32:25.080
Facing you?

32:25.180 --> 32:28.381
No, his back should be
towards the house.

32:30.585 --> 32:32.454
What do you think we should name him?

32:32.554 --> 32:34.531
I don't know.

32:35.223 --> 32:37.356
What's your mom's name?

32:58.079 --> 32:59.128
That looks good.

33:25.674 --> 33:26.723
Andy?

33:28.676 --> 33:30.777
What are you doing?

33:51.399 --> 33:53.847
I need you to go home.

34:56.998 --> 34:59.524
How do you feel today?

35:00.068 --> 35:01.901
Fine.

35:29.897 --> 35:31.667
Thank you.

35:31.767 --> 35:34.208
I'm really sorry about this.

35:35.037 --> 35:38.940
You know this acting out behavior,
it's probably just displaced emotions.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.807
You know she doesn't know
who to be angry at.

35:42.243 --> 35:44.413
What makes you think she's angry?

35:44.513 --> 35:47.889
I made it perfectly clear
that Andy wasn't up to playing,

35:47.989 --> 35:49.785
but she wouldn't listen.

35:49.885 --> 35:52.952
She's in a new place, she's just...

35:53.587 --> 35:56.589
she's just trying to find a friend.

35:59.226 --> 36:03.065
We have her set to see
the psychologist at school.

36:03.165 --> 36:07.600
It'll be good for her to have
a professional to speak with.

36:08.002 --> 36:09.972
Maybe so...

36:10.072 --> 36:13.339
but she still needs to have a friend.

36:15.077 --> 36:18.113
I know it's hard for Maryann right now.

36:18.213 --> 36:20.086
Really?

36:21.649 --> 36:24.684
But I think I need to let you know
that Andy is dying.

36:29.724 --> 36:33.361
We are so sorry to hear that, Katherine.

36:33.461 --> 36:36.431
Losing James, Maryann's dad was...

36:36.531 --> 36:39.234
was the hardest thing
that we have ever faced.

36:39.334 --> 36:41.076
Still facing.

37:06.427 --> 37:08.196
Hi, Dr. Young.

37:08.296 --> 37:10.413
Hello, Maryann.

37:21.409 --> 37:23.343
I should be getting back to Andy.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.940
What are you doing?

37:52.040 --> 37:55.542
Maybe soon I can go out
to play with Maryann.

37:59.046 --> 38:03.248
Her grandparents and I agreed
it's probably not a good idea.

38:04.251 --> 38:05.308
Why?

38:08.088 --> 38:09.955
Pathogens.

38:11.892 --> 38:13.926
It's time to eat.

38:15.129 --> 38:18.077
Can you walk me into the kitchen?

38:18.349 --> 38:23.435
Dad says that if I wanna get my legs
stronger I have to practice walking.

38:31.612 --> 38:33.688
I don't think so.

38:51.398 --> 38:53.435
Hi, Maryann.

38:53.535 --> 38:55.537
- What're you...
- Homework.

38:55.837 --> 38:57.739
What did Andy's mom want?

38:57.839 --> 39:00.109
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

39:00.709 --> 39:03.345
Well, she just came over
to introduce herself.

39:03.445 --> 39:06.014
Did she say why she didn't like me?

39:08.083 --> 39:10.618
She likes you just fine.

39:10.718 --> 39:15.840
She's... she's just concerned
for her son. He's very sick.

39:16.291 --> 39:19.158
And he doesn't have
much energy these days.

39:19.493 --> 39:22.194
- He seems fine to me.
- Well, he isn't.

39:25.266 --> 39:28.370
- I don't want you latch on to this boy.
- He's my friend.

39:28.470 --> 39:32.607
There must other kids at school
that you could play with.

39:32.707 --> 39:34.227
This isn't fair. I mean...

39:34.327 --> 39:37.444
I finally make a friend around here and now
I'm not allowed to hang out with him?

39:41.181 --> 39:43.315
Fine, whatever.

40:57.891 --> 40:59.413
His liver is failing.

41:02.129 --> 41:05.031
With the amount of toxins in his body,
what do you expect?

41:06.400 --> 41:08.868
I don't expect this.

41:09.803 --> 41:12.240
He's overly medicated.

41:12.540 --> 41:14.743
I've been telling you to slow it down.

41:14.943 --> 41:18.280
- Is that your diagnosis?
- I know you're the doctor.

41:19.280 --> 41:24.085
Yeah. And I'm not a wait-and-see
kinda doctor, alright?

41:24.619 --> 41:26.951
I'm proactive and I...

41:27.821 --> 41:29.491
I'm sticking to this treatment plan.

41:29.591 --> 41:33.461
Then you have to take me
into the train on your way in.

41:33.561 --> 41:35.430
Why?

41:35.730 --> 41:38.816
Sandra is not gonna come
all the way out here.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.336
I need to meet her.

41:41.436 --> 41:43.004
Okay.

41:43.104 --> 41:44.915
She's doing us a big favor.

41:45.707 --> 41:48.741
Please don't leave him alone
for too long.

41:51.445 --> 41:54.247
I'll make sure he has the cordless.

42:33.988 --> 42:35.772
Yes.

42:45.933 --> 42:48.500
Those were your dad's gloves.

42:52.172 --> 42:54.214
Can I use 'em?

42:55.875 --> 42:58.210
Do you wanna play catch?

43:00.174 --> 43:03.850
Well, I met a new kid
at school that wants to play.

43:07.554 --> 43:08.477
Sure.

43:13.927 --> 43:15.967
Don't lose them.

43:40.687 --> 43:42.991
Where'd your parents go?

43:43.091 --> 43:45.124
What are you doing here?

43:49.697 --> 43:51.783
I have a surprise for you.

43:52.667 --> 43:54.720
I'm not allowed.

43:56.670 --> 43:59.206
- Where's your coat?
- I don't have a coat.

44:01.608 --> 44:03.211
Put this on.

44:03.311 --> 44:07.048
I'm not allowed to go outside
unsupervised... in a robe.

44:07.148 --> 44:09.582
You're with me. It's fine.

44:11.752 --> 44:14.420
My mom isn't gonna like this.

44:17.657 --> 44:19.515
Open it.

44:24.932 --> 44:27.029
Oh, my God.

44:28.135 --> 44:31.034
They were my dad's when he was a kid.

44:31.606 --> 44:35.451
Okay. Get the phone from my room.

44:44.618 --> 44:47.188
Wait, wait. Can't we just
play catch in the porch?

44:47.288 --> 44:50.557
Well, I don't think you'd be able
to explain a broken window.

45:04.671 --> 45:07.776
My mom said that you
wouldn't be coming by anymore.

45:07.876 --> 45:11.079
She told my grandmother
I should leave you alone.

45:11.179 --> 45:15.136
- Why?
- It's probably the sexual tension.

45:15.650 --> 45:17.412
What?

45:17.512 --> 45:19.821
You're so uptight.

45:19.921 --> 45:22.007
Put your mitt on.

45:23.624 --> 45:27.629
- Do you think it's because I'm dying?
- I wouldn't worry about that right now.

45:27.729 --> 45:31.350
I would focus on this ball
I'm about to throw at your face.

45:32.100 --> 45:34.536
Don't throw it too hard.

45:34.636 --> 45:37.850
Can you come a little closer?
This is my first time.

45:39.307 --> 45:41.503
Are you ready?

45:49.449 --> 45:53.087
Maybe we can make you
a hockey goalie instead.

45:53.187 --> 45:55.491
You have to open your hand.

45:59.293 --> 46:01.160
Nice.

46:01.995 --> 46:04.473
Now throw it back.

46:11.271 --> 46:14.576
Alright. You're doing good.

46:14.676 --> 46:15.794
I mean...

46:16.377 --> 46:19.812
you throw like a girl,
but we can work on that.

46:33.293 --> 46:35.130
Hello?

46:35.830 --> 46:38.280
Oh, hi, mom.

46:39.499 --> 46:42.901
Yeah... every... everything is fine.

46:44.171 --> 46:47.048
Okay. Bye.

46:48.675 --> 46:50.814
She's on her way home.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.378
We have to hurry.

46:57.284 --> 46:59.852
Hurry, she'll be here any minute.

47:06.995 --> 47:09.764
Pull. Pull.

47:09.864 --> 47:12.898
- I can't get the wheels up.
- Turn me around.

47:27.414 --> 47:29.582
One, two, three.

47:37.558 --> 47:39.294
I moved my leg.

47:39.394 --> 47:42.890
Maybe being scared of your mom helps.

50:04.372 --> 50:06.238
Hello?

50:14.014 --> 50:16.081
Oh, my God!

50:34.434 --> 50:36.299
Hello?

51:23.183 --> 51:25.212
What happened?

51:27.088 --> 51:29.126
You getting feisty again?

51:49.342 --> 51:51.748
- What happened?
- I don't know.

51:52.747 --> 51:57.151
He must have pulled it out.
And... he's getting his strength back.

51:57.251 --> 52:00.955
Well, I suppose that's a positive sign.

52:01.055 --> 52:02.933
He's getting better.

52:04.124 --> 52:06.413
Get me one of those.

52:06.961 --> 52:08.738
What?

52:13.366 --> 52:15.335
Thank you.

52:20.208 --> 52:21.942
What about his liver?

52:25.946 --> 52:27.819
I'm sorry...

52:38.058 --> 52:39.861
I need you to clean that up.

52:40.361 --> 52:44.187
You're gonna take a shower
because you smell like her.

54:10.517 --> 54:14.022
- Was someone here when I was gone?
- No.

54:14.122 --> 54:16.989
Well, then who put the phone
on the charger?

54:19.893 --> 54:21.495
I did.

54:24.699 --> 54:28.302
So you just got up for the first time

54:28.402 --> 54:30.673
and decided to put the phone
on the charger?

54:32.173 --> 54:33.212
Yes.

54:39.746 --> 54:41.745
Show me.

54:48.154 --> 54:51.857
- Do it again.
- I can't, I...

54:52.660 --> 54:54.120
Sure you can.

54:54.220 --> 54:56.546
I want you to get up out of bed

54:56.646 --> 55:00.804
and show me how you put the phone
on the charger for the first time!

55:00.904 --> 55:02.871
I'm sorry.

55:08.374 --> 55:10.611
I'll be damned...

55:10.811 --> 55:13.245
if I'm gonna let you treat me this way!

55:16.916 --> 55:18.385
Wait!

55:20.188 --> 55:23.024
She's only using you
for your video games anyway!

55:23.124 --> 55:25.092
Katherine, that's enough.

55:25.292 --> 55:26.961
- Leave him alone! Leave him alone!
- Katherine...

55:27.061 --> 55:28.863
- Don't touch him!
- Katherine.

55:28.963 --> 55:31.532
- He is a rotten little liar!
- Katherine...

55:31.632 --> 55:34.835
- He is lying to me.
- Okay. You need to walk away.

55:34.935 --> 55:37.264
Okay? You need to walk away.

55:38.905 --> 55:40.124
Mom...

55:40.224 --> 55:42.417
- You're not such a big boy now, are you?
- Katherine!

55:42.517 --> 55:44.442
Mom!

55:53.086 --> 55:55.623
You need to take a breath.
You're loosing it.

55:55.723 --> 55:57.091
He's lying to me.

55:57.191 --> 55:58.993
It doesn't matter.
You can't treat him like that.

55:59.093 --> 56:02.661
- I know she was in this house.
- Good for him!

56:06.533 --> 56:08.966
You don't even care.

56:11.771 --> 56:13.941
We're all making sacrifices here.

56:14.041 --> 56:15.910
What have you ever sacrificed?

56:16.610 --> 56:19.997
I stopped working
so I could take care of him.

56:20.097 --> 56:23.661
No, you quit your job so you could stay
at home and get drunk and do nothing,

56:23.761 --> 56:25.786
that's what you did.

56:25.886 --> 56:29.290
I have taken care of him his whole life.

56:29.390 --> 56:31.651
What do you expect?

56:31.751 --> 56:33.696
Children are for life.

56:34.727 --> 56:36.510
Really?

56:49.676 --> 56:51.653
You okay?

56:54.547 --> 56:58.434
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Oh, Jesus.

57:10.160 --> 57:12.029
Sorry.

57:21.958 --> 57:24.460
Maryann took me outside to play catch.

57:27.981 --> 57:30.417
You didn't want to tell
your mother about that.

57:30.517 --> 57:32.424
No.

57:32.524 --> 57:35.578
I didn't want to get Maryann in trouble.

57:35.678 --> 57:38.488
She was just trying to be nice.

57:38.588 --> 57:40.608
I know.

57:42.095 --> 57:45.797
It's good to have someone
to talk to. Isn't it?

57:46.566 --> 57:49.465
Why is it such a big deal
when she comes over?

57:49.803 --> 57:54.608
Well... when this all blows over
I'll ask your mom if...

57:54.708 --> 57:58.448
Maryann can come by some day. Okay?

57:59.346 --> 58:01.732
Let's just give it some time.

58:12.125 --> 58:14.114
Thanks.

58:32.946 --> 58:36.183
"Salinger, though I think
he is listening, seems preoccupied.

58:36.283 --> 58:39.051
"He draws yellow lines
on the map, but I follow them.

58:52.865 --> 58:54.668
"What do you do?", counters Jerry.

58:54.768 --> 58:57.204
"I don't hear you babbling on
about the joys of barn cleaning

58:57.304 --> 59:01.207
"or pouring anhydrous ammonia
on your stubble or whatever else you do."

59:40.112 --> 59:43.048
How much of his liver does he need?

59:45.084 --> 59:48.923
- It's just a little part of the left lobe.
- Just?

59:49.123 --> 59:52.306
It's a simple procedure.
It'll grow back.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.763
We could've avoided this.

59:55.863 --> 59:58.299
If we don't do it now...

59:58.399 --> 59:59.993
he'll be dead within a month.

01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:04.445
I have to go.

01:00:06.639 --> 01:00:08.609
- Where now?
- Oh, you know...

01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:13.556
running around, doing nothing. My usual.

01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:05.497
Mom, what are you doing?

01:01:17.777 --> 01:01:19.508
Right.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.615
I forgot.

01:01:21.715 --> 01:01:23.948
You wanna play baseball?

01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:27.518
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:27.854 --> 01:01:29.876
You wanna play baseball?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.446
Do I play baseball?

01:02:12.732 --> 01:02:14.465
Mom?

01:02:15.334 --> 01:02:16.991
No.

01:02:18.271 --> 01:02:19.904
Please, don't.

01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:26.581
- Mom, mom! I'm sorry, please.
- You wanna lie to me?

01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:29.670
You wanna lie to your mother.

01:02:33.452 --> 01:02:37.521
Andy. You lied to me!

01:02:40.227 --> 01:02:44.224
- What's this?
- Don't. Stop.

01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:51.772
Close the window.

01:02:51.872 --> 01:02:54.374
Close the window!

01:02:54.474 --> 01:02:57.139
Close the window now!

01:03:08.487 --> 01:03:11.589
- How you doing?
- Andy's mother is crazy.

01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:15.028
- See.
- Sweetie.

01:03:15.128 --> 01:03:19.555
They have another boy in the basement
and I think they kidnapped him.

01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:23.036
You know, you just can't go
sayin' things like that.

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:25.138
But I have proof.

01:03:25.238 --> 01:03:27.074
Look.

01:03:27.174 --> 01:03:31.270
I think you should take a break
from the computer and read a book.

01:03:43.956 --> 01:03:46.225
Are you upset about this?

01:03:46.325 --> 01:03:47.961
About us?

01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:52.163
No. It was...
it was nice, you're very nice.

01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:57.235
You know, she doesn't appreciate you.

01:03:59.539 --> 01:04:03.511
I've tried. It just doesn't work.

01:04:04.778 --> 01:04:06.813
You know, if you need a place to stay...

01:04:06.913 --> 01:04:08.715
No.

01:04:08.815 --> 01:04:11.174
I can't leave Andy.

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:15.343
Yeah, I know.

01:04:16.922 --> 01:04:20.528
Thing I love about you is
the thing that keeps you away.

01:04:21.028 --> 01:04:24.795
All we do is exist to sustain him.

01:04:25.698 --> 01:04:27.968
It isn't good for any of us.

01:04:28.068 --> 01:04:30.838
You know, it might be better
for him if you separated.

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:34.641
- Kids pick up on bad vibes and...
- We don't fight in front of him.

01:04:34.741 --> 01:04:36.677
Okay, okay.

01:04:36.777 --> 01:04:38.936
I'm not pushing.

01:04:45.151 --> 01:04:46.948
Thank you.

01:04:54.227 --> 01:04:56.494
I have to go.

01:05:12.278 --> 01:05:14.145
Go.

01:05:51.183 --> 01:05:53.120
What the hell are you doing?

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:58.558
You know, he had an opportunity to tell me
the truth and he chose to protect her.

01:05:59.825 --> 01:06:02.316
I want you to stop this.

01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:12.439
Katherine. Katherine, Katherine.
He didn't do anything.

01:06:12.539 --> 01:06:15.215
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:06:15.315 --> 01:06:17.264
Okay?

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.749
No, he did. You weren't home.

01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:26.053
He is a liar and he is a little cheat.

01:06:26.153 --> 01:06:29.828
- I won't have it in my house.
- I slept with Sandra.

01:06:50.643 --> 01:06:52.813
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:56.984
- I didn't... I didn't mean...
- You and...

01:06:57.084 --> 01:06:59.186
What do you wanna do?

01:07:01.487 --> 01:07:03.563
I don't know.

01:07:05.257 --> 01:07:08.222
I... I don't know.

01:07:12.364 --> 01:07:14.198
I...

01:07:15.568 --> 01:07:18.936
I can't... I can't take...

01:07:20.205 --> 01:07:22.476
- I can't take this.
- Okay.

01:07:22.576 --> 01:07:25.008
I can't take this anymore.

01:07:38.524 --> 01:07:39.960
- I'm sorry...
- You don't love me anymore?

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.362
I love you, Katherine.

01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:44.530
I love you.

01:07:45.665 --> 01:07:49.837
What are we gonna do? What me
and Andy are gonna do if you go?

01:07:50.337 --> 01:07:52.439
I won't leave. I won't leave.

01:07:52.539 --> 01:07:55.072
- You're not gonna leave?
- No.

01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:59.012
No, no. I won't leave him.

01:07:59.112 --> 01:08:02.847
- Him? I meant me.
- I know.

01:08:05.017 --> 01:08:07.587
Hey, it's me and you.

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:10.567
Me, Andy and our little family.

01:08:11.757 --> 01:08:13.560
I love you.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.462
Come here.

01:08:15.562 --> 01:08:17.964
I'm sorry, but I understand.

01:08:18.064 --> 01:08:21.268
I'm not a monster. I forgive you.

01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:23.434
I forgive you.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:28.008
Hey, listen. You gonna stay? Yeah?

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:32.644
- Yes, yes. I will.
- We've gotta start prepping for surgery.

01:11:06.698 --> 01:11:09.567
I'm gonna go check on him.
Get some sleep.

01:11:25.384 --> 01:11:27.192
Goodnight.

01:12:28.414 --> 01:12:30.753
Oh, my God.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:49.202
It's getting cold out.
You should wait for the bus inside.

01:12:49.302 --> 01:12:51.005
I'm fine.

01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:53.837
Well, I'm cold.

01:13:19.735 --> 01:13:21.565
Hey, champ.

01:13:27.706 --> 01:13:30.607
You're probably wondering
what the heck happened.

01:13:34.846 --> 01:13:37.881
Well, we had an emergency last night.

01:13:38.951 --> 01:13:42.786
It was your appendix.
But your mother took care of it.

01:13:43.155 --> 01:13:44.877
My side hurts.

01:13:46.191 --> 01:13:48.492
I know. It's gonna.

01:13:49.695 --> 01:13:52.730
I'll get you something
for the pain, okay?

01:14:08.046 --> 01:14:10.114
I have to talk to you.

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:13.637
My dad, he...

01:14:30.002 --> 01:14:34.505
This won't help you wake up
but it'll take care of the pain.

01:15:00.833 --> 01:15:03.700
Let's take a look at those stitches.

01:16:03.662 --> 01:16:05.729
What are you doing?

01:16:07.933 --> 01:16:09.755
Katherine!

01:16:10.276 --> 01:16:13.137
- Why are you doing this?
- There's a draft.

01:16:17.609 --> 01:16:21.460
Don't worry about this, okay?
I'll be right back.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.191
Get some rest.

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.465
Your parents have someone
in the basement.

01:16:44.437 --> 01:16:48.942
There's a kid down there.
Hooked up to all these machines.

01:16:49.042 --> 01:16:51.575
I think he's dying too.

01:16:54.313 --> 01:16:56.739
I have a brother? I have a brother?

01:16:56.839 --> 01:16:59.517
No, I don't think so, but...

01:16:59.617 --> 01:17:01.688
his name is Jason Kimanick.

01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:03.923
What?

01:17:04.023 --> 01:17:06.257
I think they kidnapped him.

01:17:08.894 --> 01:17:10.825
Read this.

01:17:11.397 --> 01:17:14.159
No. Go home, please.

01:17:56.942 --> 01:17:58.978
Were you in that house again?

01:17:59.078 --> 01:18:02.068
The school called.
You were absent today.

01:18:02.515 --> 01:18:03.917
- Go to your room...
- No, grandma, please...

01:18:04.017 --> 01:18:07.019
Your grandfather will drive you
to school from now on.

01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:12.759
And you will stay inside
this house after school.

01:18:12.859 --> 01:18:14.958
Do you understand?

01:18:16.294 --> 01:18:19.565
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

01:18:19.665 --> 01:18:23.134
I know it won't. You're grounded.

01:18:51.364 --> 01:18:53.130
Hey.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.671
Look what I got.

01:18:59.706 --> 01:19:03.124
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:19:10.849 --> 01:19:14.251
- How you feeling?
- It just hurts.

01:19:20.759 --> 01:19:22.031
Hi, Mom.

01:19:26.398 --> 01:19:29.899
Katherine, he said hi.

01:19:38.743 --> 01:19:42.713
- How's it looking?
- As well as can be expected.

01:19:45.217 --> 01:19:48.169
I'm sorry about...

01:19:48.654 --> 01:19:50.324
Don't worry about it.

01:19:51.224 --> 01:19:55.058
Why'd you stop having kids after me?

01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:09.651
Is it because I came out sick?

01:20:10.676 --> 01:20:12.478
Andy.

01:20:15.647 --> 01:20:19.703
God only gave us one child
to love and take care of.

01:20:20.486 --> 01:20:22.542
And you were all we needed
to make a family.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.828
Hey. Don't worry about it.

01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:34.477
It doesn't matter.

01:21:46.137 --> 01:21:48.187
What's your name?

01:21:50.909 --> 01:21:54.291
I'm Andy. Can you hear me?

01:21:56.648 --> 01:21:59.455
I just got my appendix out.

01:22:08.226 --> 01:22:11.037
How... how long have you been down here?

01:22:12.397 --> 01:22:14.205
Andy.

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.854
Andy, what...

01:22:17.703 --> 01:22:20.573
How did... how did you...
What are you doing down here?

01:22:20.673 --> 01:22:22.108
No.

01:22:22.508 --> 01:22:25.211
No, you have to...
you have to come with me.

01:22:25.311 --> 01:22:28.014
- Let's get you upstairs.
- Dad.

01:22:28.114 --> 01:22:31.418
- Why did... why did you lie to me?
- Okay.

01:22:32.018 --> 01:22:35.162
He's very sick, Andy.

01:22:38.523 --> 01:22:41.255
Why... why is it such a secret?

01:22:43.528 --> 01:22:46.812
He's dying, Andy.

01:22:49.934 --> 01:22:51.504
He's dying.

01:22:52.104 --> 01:22:54.707
And your mother felt that...

01:22:54.807 --> 01:22:57.815
you shouldn't be subjected to that.

01:22:58.577 --> 01:23:01.113
We didn't think
that you would get any better

01:23:01.213 --> 01:23:05.217
laying next to another
sick boy. Alright?

01:23:05.317 --> 01:23:06.769
I want to know him.

01:23:06.869 --> 01:23:11.332
You can't. You can't know him.
He does not exist.

01:23:12.124 --> 01:23:14.691
He does not exist to you.

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:17.329
Okay?

01:23:17.429 --> 01:23:21.067
Your mother... your mother cannot find out
about this. We need to get you upstairs.

01:23:21.167 --> 01:23:24.734
Wait. Is he... is he my brother?

01:23:26.304 --> 01:23:27.608
No.

01:23:28.808 --> 01:23:31.301
Then please, Dad.

01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:35.915
- Please just tell me what's going on here.
- Andy, we need to get you to bed right now.

01:23:36.015 --> 01:23:39.083
- Stop. Wait, what about him?
- He'll be fine.

01:23:45.224 --> 01:23:48.291
Oh, God. Andy.

01:24:05.677 --> 01:24:09.573
- Is he okay?
- Yes. Yeah, he'll be fine.

01:24:16.688 --> 01:24:19.758
I just found him down here.
I don't... I don't know.

01:24:19.858 --> 01:24:22.728
- Mom, please.
- I don't know what...

01:24:23.028 --> 01:24:26.265
Please. Who is he?

01:24:26.365 --> 01:24:29.201
- Hey, let's go back.
- Stop.

01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:30.838
- Mom.
- No.

01:24:32.338 --> 01:24:33.939
Mom!

01:24:34.039 --> 01:24:36.251
Mom, who is he?

01:24:36.875 --> 01:24:38.744
He's my son.

01:24:38.844 --> 01:24:40.956
Oh, God.

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.916
If he... if he's your son...

01:24:44.016 --> 01:24:46.089
who am I?

01:24:47.785 --> 01:24:49.959
Who am I?

01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:54.116
<i>Play ball!</i>

01:24:57.129 --> 01:24:59.031
School night, you know.

01:24:59.131 --> 01:25:01.498
They're gonna give
Jason's heart to Andy.

01:25:05.637 --> 01:25:07.688
Is that what you really think?

01:25:09.541 --> 01:25:12.573
Why won't anyone believe me?

01:25:13.112 --> 01:25:17.847
When I was a kid, I had friends
that I wasn't allowed to hang out with.

01:25:20.635 --> 01:25:22.299
But that didn't stop me.

01:25:23.455 --> 01:25:25.070
Follow your heart, Maryann.

01:25:26.925 --> 01:25:29.229
Follow your heart.

01:25:50.216 --> 01:25:54.234
Andy, wake up.
You're in trouble, please wake up.

01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:00.939
I need to talk to you.

01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:13.904
Help me.

01:26:21.312 --> 01:26:23.180
Katherine.

01:26:24.983 --> 01:26:26.955
Please stop.

01:26:29.587 --> 01:26:31.352
Please.

01:26:49.274 --> 01:26:51.996
Look, we both knew this day would come.

01:26:53.412 --> 01:26:55.586
So, that's it?

01:26:56.749 --> 01:26:59.245
We just take his heart?

01:27:01.853 --> 01:27:04.449
Andy, are you okay?

01:27:06.191 --> 01:27:10.104
- I saw... I saw him.
- What? You went down there?

01:27:11.664 --> 01:27:13.542
Yeah.

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:17.134
Your parents kidnapped Jason.

01:27:21.039 --> 01:27:23.271
They're not my parents.

01:27:25.843 --> 01:27:27.642
What?

01:27:29.266 --> 01:27:32.081
I'm... I'm not Andy.

01:27:34.552 --> 01:27:36.479
The boy...

01:27:37.655 --> 01:27:40.163
he... he's Andy.

01:27:42.927 --> 01:27:45.330
You're the one they kidnapped
from the hospital?

01:27:48.634 --> 01:27:52.504
- I'm Jason.
- Okay. We have to get you out of here.

01:27:52.604 --> 01:27:56.573
He's still a person.
How can you dismiss that?

01:28:00.545 --> 01:28:02.981
I'm not dismissing anything.

01:28:03.081 --> 01:28:06.385
But Jason Kimanick is not our son.

01:28:06.485 --> 01:28:08.287
But he's a boy.

01:28:09.221 --> 01:28:14.648
He's just a boy and despite everything
we've done to him, I...

01:28:17.028 --> 01:28:19.362
I don't want him to die.

01:28:24.335 --> 01:28:26.810
He's not dying.

01:28:27.172 --> 01:28:29.897
He's not dying.

01:28:31.076 --> 01:28:33.639
He's saving our son.

01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:45.525
Clear.

01:28:50.128 --> 01:28:52.252
Go bring him down.

01:28:59.337 --> 01:29:01.440
Mommy's gonna make you all better.

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.976
Hurry, Richard! Hurry!

01:29:04.076 --> 01:29:05.933
I am.

01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:18.721
- Leave him alone.
- No. I am not gonna hurt him.

01:29:18.991 --> 01:29:21.302
Well, then let us go.

01:29:23.027 --> 01:29:24.628
I'm so sorry.

01:29:26.332 --> 01:29:29.316
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:29:30.002 --> 01:29:33.177
For so long, I know it's...

01:29:35.806 --> 01:29:38.400
it's unforgivable.

01:29:39.077 --> 01:29:40.364
I know.

01:29:42.646 --> 01:29:45.284
I never had...

01:29:45.384 --> 01:29:48.402
I never thought... I never thought...

01:29:50.122 --> 01:29:52.645
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:30:00.531 --> 01:30:03.028
I need you to trust me.

01:30:03.568 --> 01:30:07.672
- No. No.
- No. It's epinephrine, it's adrenaline.

01:30:07.772 --> 01:30:10.008
It'll give him the energy he needs
to get out of here.

01:30:10.108 --> 01:30:11.810
- Put that needle down!
- Please, Maryann.

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:13.278
- Put it down!
- Maryann!

01:30:13.378 --> 01:30:15.411
Put the needle down!

01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:27.993
No, no, no!

01:30:28.093 --> 01:30:31.758
- No, no!
- Andy, I promise. It'll take time

01:30:31.858 --> 01:30:33.999
and a lot of work,
but you'll get your strength back.

01:30:34.099 --> 01:30:35.534
No!

01:30:35.634 --> 01:30:37.875
Andy? Andy.

01:30:44.875 --> 01:30:47.126
Maryann, let's get him out of here.

01:30:47.646 --> 01:30:50.194
Come on, come on.

01:31:27.852 --> 01:31:29.309
Go! Quick!

01:31:31.223 --> 01:31:34.593
- Where is he? Where he'd go?
- It's over, Katherine. He's gone.

01:31:34.693 --> 01:31:37.563
No, where... What are you doing?
Where is he?

01:31:37.663 --> 01:31:42.434
- No, where is he? Where is he gone?
- He's gone. That's it. Let's go.

01:31:42.534 --> 01:31:43.969
- No. He'll die without him.
- I know.

01:31:44.069 --> 01:31:46.071
He's gonna die! He's gonna die!

01:31:46.171 --> 01:31:49.341
- Richard, he's gonna die without him.
- Listen to me, Katherine.

01:31:49.441 --> 01:31:52.111
He's been dead a long time.

01:31:52.211 --> 01:31:54.481
He's been dead...

01:31:55.747 --> 01:31:58.383
such a long time.

01:31:58.483 --> 01:32:00.817
We have to let him go.

01:32:07.301 --> 01:32:09.361
I love you.

01:32:33.584 --> 01:32:35.719
Andy!

01:32:35.819 --> 01:32:38.107
Andy!

01:32:39.824 --> 01:32:41.657
Andy!

01:33:13.324 --> 01:33:15.257
Okay.

01:33:20.664 --> 01:33:21.851
Come on.

01:33:46.891 --> 01:33:48.260
- Will you just stand.
- I can't.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.095
But you have to!

01:33:50.195 --> 01:33:52.862
You have to! Please, just help me out.

01:34:07.161 --> 01:34:10.291
One step at a time. You got it.

01:34:19.223 --> 01:34:21.804
Okay. You got this.

01:34:24.362 --> 01:34:26.429
We're almost there.

01:34:43.113 --> 01:34:44.362
Where'd you go?

01:34:45.617 --> 01:34:48.418
You think you can just leave?

01:34:49.153 --> 01:34:51.202
And you!

01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:56.928
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my house?

01:34:57.028 --> 01:35:00.932
Andy, it is time to go home!
I need you to come here now!

01:35:01.032 --> 01:35:04.310
If you can walk there,
you can walk back!

01:36:00.257 --> 01:36:02.324
Now look!

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.363
Look what you've done!

01:36:05.463 --> 01:36:07.904
Look what you've done!

01:36:12.202 --> 01:36:14.336
Look what you've done!

01:36:38.863 --> 01:36:40.349
No!

01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:55.612
No! Andy!

01:37:22.372 --> 01:37:25.009
My baby! No!

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:27.946
Richard! Richard!

01:37:28.046 --> 01:37:30.012
Richard!

01:37:30.949 --> 01:37:32.901
Andy!

01:37:35.246 --> 01:37:36.492
Andy!

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.301
Is she gone?

01:37:52.704 --> 01:37:54.780
I think so.

01:38:15.659 --> 01:38:17.393
Strike.

01:38:21.299 --> 01:38:24.569
- Eyes on the ball.
- Right, come on.

01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:28.470
- Two-O, Two-O.
- Don't worry, she can hit this.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.574
Keep your eye on the ball, Maryann.

01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:33.830
Yes.

01:38:40.184 --> 01:38:41.915
Got it.

01:38:45.956 --> 01:38:47.968
Far out.
