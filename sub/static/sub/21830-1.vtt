00:02.637 --> 00:06.720
♪ ♪

00:13.426 --> 00:16.090
I want to open a gift.
Which one should I open first?

00:16.091 --> 00:18.757
This one? Oh, it's a pretty green, so...

00:18.799 --> 00:20.132
Yeah... oh, this one's from me.

00:20.173 --> 00:21.422
Go ahead, open it. Yep.

00:21.423 --> 00:24.755
Whew. Pressure's on. Okay!

00:26.004 --> 00:29.003
Oh, I know I'm going to love it.

00:29.045 --> 00:30.044
Oh!

00:30.086 --> 00:32.043
This is so cute!

00:32.086 --> 00:33.043
Thanks, Emma.

00:33.085 --> 00:34.960
Oh, there's another engraving on the back.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.042
Oh!

00:36.084 --> 00:39.250
"Congratulations, Melanie and D... Darren."

00:40.333 --> 00:42.207
Oh, my gosh...

00:42.249 --> 00:43.165
I'm so sorry.

00:43.207 --> 00:44.207
I must have got confused from last time.

00:44.248 --> 00:46.664
-That's okay.-Let's do a toast.

00:46.705 --> 00:49.621
To Melanie and Robert.

00:49.663 --> 00:51.079
May you have a life of love, laughter

00:51.121 --> 00:53.286
and happily ever after.

00:54.203 --> 00:55.161
Thanks, Mom.

00:55.203 --> 00:56.786
Cheers to that.

00:58.618 --> 01:01.575
- Yes!
- Yay!

01:01.617 --> 01:03.409
Okay, ladies, now...

01:03.450 --> 01:05.407
to the games!

01:05.408 --> 01:07.490
To the games! Let's do it!

01:09.739 --> 01:11.947
Okay, Mom, you can do it.

01:13.488 --> 01:16.403
- What's it gonna be?
- Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:16.404 --> 01:18.320
Oh! What do we have?

01:18.362 --> 01:19.986
A wedding tip!

01:20.028 --> 01:22.111
I'm sure Mom will have fun with this one.

01:24.193 --> 01:25.776
Come on, Mrs. B, tell us your secret!

01:25.818 --> 01:28.732
Okay, I have a few.

01:28.733 --> 01:31.233
Um, let's think...

01:31.274 --> 01:32.565
Well, as you know,

01:32.607 --> 01:34.523
Gord and I are celebrating

01:34.564 --> 01:36.064
our 30-year anniversary.

01:39.063 --> 01:40.270
So I'm just saying,

01:40.312 --> 01:43.020
I do have a tip or two.

01:43.895 --> 01:44.811
Melanie,

01:44.852 --> 01:46.268
sweetheart,

01:46.310 --> 01:47.435
don't overthink things

01:47.477 --> 01:49.892
like we women do.

01:49.893 --> 01:52.184
Sometimes you just have to go for it.

01:52.225 --> 01:53.225
Take the plunge.

01:53.266 --> 01:54.141
Head first.

01:54.183 --> 01:55.224
Feet first. I don't care.

01:55.265 --> 01:56.182
Just do it.

01:56.224 --> 01:57.973
Not very subtle, is she?

01:58.015 --> 01:58.932
Do you blame her?

01:58.972 --> 01:59.931
Hey, you got this.

01:59.972 --> 02:01.181
Three times the charm, right?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.639
Right, let's just hope I get his name right

02:02.680 --> 02:03.805
when he's at the altar.

02:03.846 --> 02:05.053
You can totally get that
engraving burned out.

02:05.054 --> 02:06.012
Okay.

02:06.054 --> 02:07.886
Whose turn?

02:07.887 --> 02:08.886
Is it... okay!

02:08.928 --> 02:09.969
What? Me?

02:10.011 --> 02:11.009
Spin that wheel, baby.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.134
Whoo!

02:16.842 --> 02:18.466
What's it going to be?

02:25.214 --> 02:26.214
I love him...

02:27.922 --> 02:29.921
I love him not.

02:29.962 --> 02:31.836
I love him...

02:33.003 --> 02:35.669
Hey, your sister will be out in a minute.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.752
Then we're ready to go.

02:39.210 --> 02:40.874
-Mom...-You look gorgeous.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.873
How did you know you truly loved Dad?

02:43.874 --> 02:45.207
I mean,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.538
that "I want to spend the rest of
my life with this person,"

02:47.539 --> 02:48.539
kind of love.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.997
By marrying him.

02:51.039 --> 02:53.288
Trust me, they grow on you.

02:53.330 --> 02:54.788
So you grew to love Dad?

02:54.829 --> 02:56.953
Yes, yes, of course.

02:56.995 --> 02:59.868
Love grows and blossoms,

02:59.869 --> 03:02.285
like... like these flowers in your bouquet.

03:02.327 --> 03:05.409
Sorry to keep you waiting.

03:05.451 --> 03:07.492
My hair would not stay put.

03:07.533 --> 03:09.198
Okay, let's go! We've got to go.

03:09.199 --> 03:10.199
We're doing it!

03:10.200 --> 03:11.573
Yay!

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:20.862 --> 03:23.236
Third time's the charm.

03:23.278 --> 03:24.860
Hey, Dad.

03:24.861 --> 03:25.860
Mom.

03:25.861 --> 03:27.234
Gorgeous.

03:27.276 --> 03:28.526
Thank you.

03:28.568 --> 03:30.192
Thank you.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.981
You got this, Roo?

03:38.190 --> 03:39.897
Yeah.

04:27.714 --> 04:28.756
No!

04:30.172 --> 04:31.005
I'm sorry.

04:31.047 --> 04:33.546
No! No! Sweetheart! Wait.

05:23.321 --> 05:24.528
You know, I was thinking,

05:24.570 --> 05:26.736
maybe we should expand our
business into products.

05:26.777 --> 05:29.693
You know, like,
offering home-made granola bars

05:29.735 --> 05:30.776
after our yoga classes,

05:30.818 --> 05:31.776
or fresh smoothies,

05:31.818 --> 05:34.275
or maybe even a delivery service

05:34.317 --> 05:36.149
for healthy meals, you know?

05:36.150 --> 05:38.316
Personally, I love these fruit bars.

05:38.357 --> 05:40.690
There's so filling and delicious.

05:42.106 --> 05:44.063
Mel...

05:44.105 --> 05:45.646
are you okay?

05:46.895 --> 05:49.520
I don't know. Am I?

05:49.562 --> 05:52.143
I mean, all I do is mess everything up,

05:52.144 --> 05:53.935
so if that's considered
okay, then I guess I am,

05:53.977 --> 05:58.392
but I'm kind of starting to
think that maybe I'm not.

06:01.474 --> 06:02.474
Mel...

06:02.516 --> 06:03.515
No...

06:03.557 --> 06:05.639
Please, no, no, no. Don't
feel sorry for me.

06:05.681 --> 06:08.180
It's Rob who you should feel sorry for.

06:08.222 --> 06:11.054
He's a really, really great guy.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.096
It's just...

06:12.138 --> 06:13.013
What?

06:13.053 --> 06:16.720
I like him. I do. I like him a lot.

06:16.761 --> 06:18.634
It's just...

06:18.635 --> 06:19.635
I don't love him.

06:19.677 --> 06:22.217
Not in that happily-ever-after way.

06:24.883 --> 06:25.799
Oh...

06:25.841 --> 06:27.464
What is wrong with me?

06:27.465 --> 06:29.506
I've broken off three engagements.

06:29.548 --> 06:31.423
Well, it's better than three divorces.

06:32.298 --> 06:33.588
Sorry.

06:35.046 --> 06:35.963
How is he?

06:36.005 --> 06:37.795
Well, after you left,

06:37.837 --> 06:40.253
he got all red in the face,

06:40.295 --> 06:42.294
like he'd just bench-pressed300 pounds.

06:43.252 --> 06:44.458
Oh, this is all my fault.

06:44.459 --> 06:46.709
I should have never said
yes in the first place...

06:46.750 --> 06:48.792
although he did ask me to marry him

06:48.834 --> 06:50.124
in front of a packed spin class,

06:50.125 --> 06:52.832
and he wouldn't stop
spinning until I said yes,

06:52.873 --> 06:53.748
so I don't know,

06:53.790 --> 06:54.832
he could have had a heart attack

06:54.873 --> 06:55.789
had I said no.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.789
So it was better to break his heart?

06:58.997 --> 07:00.120
You're right. I'm awful.

07:00.121 --> 07:01.453
That's not what I'm saying.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.452
You know what? I'm done with it all.

07:03.453 --> 07:06.160
I am done with hurting anyone.

07:06.202 --> 07:08.451
I'm done with dating, engaging,

07:08.493 --> 07:09.451
almost marrying...

07:09.493 --> 07:10.451
I am... I'm done!

07:10.452 --> 07:13.783
Obviously, Rob, Justin, Darren...

07:13.825 --> 07:15.616
they all just weren't The One.

07:17.615 --> 07:18.864
The One.

07:18.906 --> 07:19.990
Have you ever met The One?

07:20.031 --> 07:21.572
No.

07:23.155 --> 07:24.572
I'm done.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.445
Yeah, that's it!

07:29.279 --> 07:31.403
Come on, man!

07:31.444 --> 07:32.568
That ball had no speed.

07:34.609 --> 07:36.317
Pay up, Damon.

07:37.401 --> 07:39.191
C-note. Thank you.

07:42.107 --> 07:43.440
Where are you going?

07:43.481 --> 07:44.398
I promised Gineen

07:44.439 --> 07:45.772
I'd help her with some wallpaper.

07:45.814 --> 07:46.772
Whipped!

07:46.772 --> 07:47.772
What did you say?

07:47.772 --> 07:48.771
He said you're whipped.

07:48.771 --> 07:49.771
That doesn't surprise me.

07:49.813 --> 07:51.062
You've got to put down the married dudes

07:51.104 --> 07:52.312
to make yourself feel better.

07:52.354 --> 07:54.811
Okay, first of all, technically,
you're not married.

07:54.852 --> 07:55.978
You're separated,

07:56.019 --> 07:57.768
and yet, you're still
doing Gineen's bidding.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.850
So I would just feel better for you

08:00.892 --> 08:02.141
if you kept playing.

08:02.183 --> 08:03.141
Is this funny to you?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.598
It's kind of funny.

08:04.599 --> 08:05.932
Fine, I'll play one more game.

08:05.974 --> 08:06.974
Right.

08:07.015 --> 08:09.598
But that's not what I was talking about.

08:09.639 --> 08:10.930
Okay, what were you talking about?

08:10.931 --> 08:12.680
Well, it's obvious you've
got a chip on your shoulder

08:12.721 --> 08:13.596
because you know

08:13.597 --> 08:14.971
you're never going to get married.

08:15.012 --> 08:17.094
Uh, and that would be a
bad thing because...?

08:17.095 --> 08:20.094
You don't get a warm body to
lay next to every night,

08:20.135 --> 08:21.219
someone to have kids with.

08:21.261 --> 08:22.425
Yeah.

08:22.426 --> 08:24.343
Fred, your kids sleep with
you and Susan every night.

08:24.385 --> 08:26.092
You are sleep-deprived and going crazy.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.841
A wife is someone to grow old with,

08:27.883 --> 08:28.841
someone to witness

08:28.883 --> 08:30.923
the miracles of life with.

08:30.924 --> 08:32.256
-Right?-Mm-hmm.

08:32.298 --> 08:33.340
Vince, there are three things in life

08:33.381 --> 08:34.714
that require a witness...

08:34.756 --> 08:36.130
crimes, accidents,

08:36.172 --> 08:37.797
and marriages.

08:37.837 --> 08:38.712
Need I say more?

08:41.419 --> 08:43.419
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:43.461 --> 08:44.419
Yeah!

08:44.461 --> 08:46.335
Hey, pal,

08:46.377 --> 08:48.168
we married guys are actually
living the dream.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.168
Yeah.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.292
The only thing your wives dream about

08:50.334 --> 08:51.708
is you guys actually doing the dishes.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.583
Besides...

08:53.625 --> 08:57.123
if I want to marry, I can get married.

09:01.122 --> 09:02.121
Oh!

09:03.080 --> 09:03.996
Look, Damon,

09:04.038 --> 09:06.245
I'm not denying you date a lot of women.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.578
You're just not a guy girls want to marry.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.743
You serious?

09:09.744 --> 09:11.244
Very. Gineen feels the same way.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.284
Okay, well, Gineen has never liked me.

09:13.326 --> 09:15.243
Fred? What about Susan?
What does she say about me?

09:15.284 --> 09:16.825
I don't know. That you're fun?

09:16.866 --> 09:17.991
See?

09:18.033 --> 09:19.616
But she wouldn't set you
up with any of her friends.

09:19.658 --> 09:20.532
Oh!

09:20.574 --> 09:21.949
See?

09:21.990 --> 09:23.156
Face it, Damon. You're that cool bachelor.

09:23.198 --> 09:26.531
Women can sense when a guy can't commit,

09:26.572 --> 09:28.780
which is why you will never get a girl

09:28.821 --> 09:31.069
to say "I do."

09:31.070 --> 09:32.945
Oh, I could, if I wanted to.

09:32.986 --> 09:33.986
Want to bet?

09:36.985 --> 09:39.234
Tell you what...

09:39.235 --> 09:41.233
you find a girl, any girl,

09:41.234 --> 09:42.316
and get her to say yes to your proposal

09:42.358 --> 09:44.982
by the end of the month,

09:45.024 --> 09:46.856
I will give you

09:46.898 --> 09:48.481
the Juicy Cola account...

09:48.522 --> 09:50.396
all the perks, all the parties.

09:50.397 --> 09:52.188
If you lose...

09:52.230 --> 09:53.812
you get Bran Buddies.

09:55.229 --> 09:56.727
Juicy's my account.

09:56.728 --> 09:58.686
And I'm the boss. What do you say, Damon?

10:03.684 --> 10:05.142
No. No.It's crazy.

10:05.184 --> 10:06.974
Well, you've already lost one bet tonight,

10:07.016 --> 10:09.556
although I've never seen
you walk away from one.

10:09.557 --> 10:10.641
Come on, man,

10:10.681 --> 10:12.181
the end of the month, that's 30 days away.

10:12.223 --> 10:13.389
What? You can't make it happen?

10:13.431 --> 10:14.764
I mean, that's what we're
talking about here.

10:14.805 --> 10:15.722
Right, guys?

10:15.764 --> 10:18.304
Yeah, but Juicy's my account.

10:19.221 --> 10:20.553
Come on, buddy.

10:20.595 --> 10:21.803
Do it.

10:21.845 --> 10:24.218
One month.

10:24.219 --> 10:26.177
Fine. It's a bet.

10:27.218 --> 10:28.301
Let's bowl!

10:28.343 --> 10:29.759
Let's do this!

10:41.588 --> 10:42.879
Hey, Rob.

10:42.921 --> 10:44.046
Hey.

10:44.087 --> 10:45.086
Do you need help?

10:45.128 --> 10:46.961
No. No, I'm good.

10:47.003 --> 10:48.503
What brings you here, Mel?

10:49.752 --> 10:52.375
Rob, I am so, so sorry.

10:52.376 --> 10:55.042
I should have talked to
you when I was feeling unsure.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.791
It's just that I thought that...

10:56.833 --> 10:58.540
maybe things would change, you know?

10:58.582 --> 11:00.872
Grow, like a weed...

11:00.873 --> 11:01.915
I mean, a flower,

11:01.956 --> 11:03.997
'cause you are definitely not a weed.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.121
You're a...

11:06.163 --> 11:08.454
a big, strong flower.

11:08.496 --> 11:10.412
A rose with thorns...

11:10.454 --> 11:13.535
not hurtful thorns.

11:13.577 --> 11:14.702
Manly.

11:14.744 --> 11:17.200
Resilient, like a perennial.

11:17.201 --> 11:18.366
Exactly,

11:18.367 --> 11:20.991
which is why I know that
you're going to be okay.

11:21.033 --> 11:22.908
You know what's great about perennials?

11:22.949 --> 11:25.198
They never give up.

11:25.199 --> 11:26.947
They keep pushing through, every spring,

11:26.989 --> 11:28.572
and I'm not giving up either.

11:28.614 --> 11:31.946
Rob, I don't think it's going to happen.

11:31.988 --> 11:33.070
You don't know that.

11:33.112 --> 11:35.153
I mean, you said so yourself.
You're unsure.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.111
I was unsure,

11:37.153 --> 11:40.401
but now I'm pretty sure.

11:43.775 --> 11:45.442
Look...

11:45.484 --> 11:47.025
I know you have your fears,

11:47.066 --> 11:49.607
but just hang onto the ring.

11:49.648 --> 11:50.732
Just trust me.

11:50.773 --> 11:52.148
You'll figure out we're
meant to be together.

11:54.522 --> 11:56.188
'Kay.

12:02.561 --> 12:03.977
You want to
change the way people think

12:04.019 --> 12:04.935
about dental work

12:04.977 --> 12:07.601
and we want your brand to reflect that.

12:07.642 --> 12:10.683
So when people see this sign...

12:11.891 --> 12:13.682
they don't cringe...

12:13.724 --> 12:14.931
they smile.

12:19.346 --> 12:21.096
I don't know how you made root canals cool,

12:21.138 --> 12:22.054
but you did.

12:22.096 --> 12:23.137
Heck, I want one.

12:23.179 --> 12:24.345
I'm just glad I stayed awake.

12:24.387 --> 12:26.678
They gave me nothing! No feedback!

12:26.719 --> 12:27.927
That was a total snooze-fest.

12:29.135 --> 12:30.508
Yes!

12:30.509 --> 12:33.341
Life is bolder with Juicy Soda...

12:33.342 --> 12:34.800
which is my account.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.424
We nailed it! Mm.

12:40.715 --> 12:42.589
So, Casanova,

12:42.630 --> 12:44.172
did you find the girl?

12:44.213 --> 12:45.005
Not yet.

12:45.046 --> 12:47.503
What about Fiona?

12:47.504 --> 12:49.170
Come on, man,

12:49.211 --> 12:50.461
I'm 10 years older than her last boyfriend.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.501
Maybe you'll get lucky
tonight at the J-oomph launch.

12:52.502 --> 12:54.334
Oh, yes...

12:54.376 --> 12:56.126
a room full of granolas and juice heads.

12:56.168 --> 12:58.542
Should be lots to pick from.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.207
You kept the ring?

13:03.249 --> 13:06.248
I tried giving it back,
but he was all, like...

13:06.289 --> 13:08.538
"I'm a perennial, and I'm not giving up."

13:08.580 --> 13:09.496
I don't even want

13:09.497 --> 13:10.662
to try to understand what that means,

13:10.663 --> 13:11.828
but what I do know

13:11.829 --> 13:13.662
is you need to stop saying
"yes" to these guys

13:13.704 --> 13:14.786
because you want to save yourself

13:14.828 --> 13:16.411
public embarrassment.

13:19.618 --> 13:20.825
Jules, you don't understand.

13:20.826 --> 13:22.824
When someone asks you to marry them,

13:22.825 --> 13:24.950
and you have all of these eyes on you...

13:24.991 --> 13:26.324
eyes that want you to say yes

13:26.366 --> 13:27.449
because if you don't,

13:27.490 --> 13:30.031
then wow, that would
be really uncomfortable...

13:30.073 --> 13:31.822
it's hard to say "no".

13:31.864 --> 13:33.446
Mel, you need to be more assertive,

13:33.488 --> 13:35.113
like when you're instructing boot camps.

13:35.155 --> 13:37.612
You never have
trouble demanding 10 more reps.

13:37.654 --> 13:38.862
You need to see these propositions

13:38.903 --> 13:39.778
like a boot camp.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.484
You're right. I can be a sergeant.

13:41.485 --> 13:42.485
There you go.

13:42.527 --> 13:44.151
So are you going to give him back the ring?

13:44.152 --> 13:45.526
Maybe next week.

13:45.568 --> 13:46.942
What?

13:51.441 --> 13:54.690
So, what's our strategy?

13:54.731 --> 13:55.897
I was thinking about what you were saying

13:55.939 --> 13:56.980
about tying in product

13:56.981 --> 13:58.980
with our workout and nutrition programs.

13:59.021 --> 14:00.813
Jules, that was a botched wedding rant.

14:00.854 --> 14:01.895
We need to do something bigger.

14:01.937 --> 14:03.812
This city is full of personal trainers

14:03.853 --> 14:04.977
and nutritionists.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.476
We need to find a way to
set ourselves apart,

14:06.477 --> 14:08.269
and seeing as this is a launch party,

14:08.310 --> 14:09.685
they're obviously trying to find

14:09.726 --> 14:11.142
ways to get their brand out there.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.517
So, let's get familiar with the products

14:13.558 --> 14:14.807
and meet some people.

14:14.808 --> 14:16.224
'Kay.

14:23.346 --> 14:24.346
Hi.

14:24.388 --> 14:27.886
May I try one of your
Green Goddesses, please?

14:27.928 --> 14:29.386
Thank you.

14:31.386 --> 14:32.468
Great smoothies.

14:32.510 --> 14:34.343
Sorry, um... Will Peters.

14:34.385 --> 14:36.966
I'm in advertising.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.216
Melanie.

14:38.258 --> 14:41.215
Melanie. It's a pleasure to
meet you, Melanie.

14:41.257 --> 14:42.590
So, you herewith company peeps,

14:42.632 --> 14:43.631
or are you here alone?

14:43.632 --> 14:45.673
Actually, I came herewith my sister.

14:45.713 --> 14:47.005
We are the company.

14:47.047 --> 14:48.838
Hey, sis! My bad. I got stuck over there.

14:48.879 --> 14:52.379
Don't worry, I was just keeping your
sister company, actually.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.753
We were just getting acquainted.

14:53.795 --> 14:54.919
You don't understand.

14:56.335 --> 14:58.085
She's fragile right now,

14:58.127 --> 15:00.376
getting over a broken engagement.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.958
She is done...

15:01.959 --> 15:03.458
dating, marriage, the whole thing.

15:04.791 --> 15:06.622
Listen, it's...

15:06.623 --> 15:09.248
been a pleasure, you ladies.

15:09.289 --> 15:10.497
Enjoy.

15:11.789 --> 15:13.496
See what I did there? I just shot him down.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.954
Bam!

15:14.995 --> 15:16.246
Bam. Got it.

15:16.287 --> 15:17.161
'Kay, good,

15:17.203 --> 15:18.786
'cause I have got some interest going.

15:18.828 --> 15:19.952
Oh, yeah?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.452
Not that kind of interest.
Some product placement.

15:21.494 --> 15:22.868
So if I leave you, you'll be good, right?

15:22.910 --> 15:24.409
I'll be so good.

15:24.451 --> 15:25.325
Scout's honor.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.492
Maybe you should put that ring back on.

15:26.534 --> 15:27.492
Hey.

15:41.861 --> 15:43.319
Hey, could I just get a soda?

15:43.361 --> 15:44.277
Diet... no?

15:44.319 --> 15:46.527
Okay, I'll just not drink this.

15:48.068 --> 15:49.859
I just found your future bride-to-be.

15:49.901 --> 15:51.192
Yeah?

15:51.234 --> 15:52.940
So why aren't you hitting on her?

15:52.941 --> 15:53.941
Fine, I struck out.

15:54.941 --> 15:55.857
Then I like her already.

15:55.899 --> 15:57.773
I think you'll like her a lot.

15:57.815 --> 15:58.939
One in the red.

16:00.022 --> 16:01.022
Oh yeah, you're right.

16:01.064 --> 16:01.938
She's cute.

16:01.979 --> 16:03.355
So do we have a contender?

16:03.396 --> 16:06.187
Sure. Why not?

16:06.229 --> 16:07.603
She's the one.

16:13.184 --> 16:14.226
I know, right?

16:14.267 --> 16:15.767
This stuff would work better as fertilizer.

16:16.849 --> 16:18.016
I won't tell anyone.

16:20.598 --> 16:22.306
So if you're not a fan
of all this good stuff,

16:22.348 --> 16:24.097
what's keeping you here?

16:24.098 --> 16:25.596
My sister.

16:25.597 --> 16:27.138
She thought maybe we could tie some product

16:27.180 --> 16:28.055
to our brand.

16:28.096 --> 16:29.388
Brand, really? That's what I do.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.094
Branding, advertising...

16:31.095 --> 16:32.719
Wow, that's...

16:32.761 --> 16:33.844
pretty popular tonight.

16:40.592 --> 16:42.008
So, uh...

16:42.050 --> 16:44.383
what do you and your sister do?

16:44.424 --> 16:46.548
We are
personal-trainers slash-nutritionists.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.464
Really?

16:48.506 --> 16:49.880
'Cause I'm looking for a personal trainer.

16:49.922 --> 16:51.254
Really?

16:51.296 --> 16:52.630
You mean you don't have
a gym where you work?

16:52.671 --> 16:55.003
You know, I'm not really a
fan of going to the gym.

16:55.045 --> 16:56.752
I work out. I play basketball,

16:56.753 --> 16:58.252
but I'm just not into people watching me,

16:58.294 --> 16:59.294
you know?

16:59.336 --> 17:00.543
I'm sure a lot of your clients feel that.

17:00.585 --> 17:01.668
I guess.

17:01.709 --> 17:03.085
You know, I'd love to know
more about what you do,

17:03.126 --> 17:04.666
the classes you offer,

17:04.708 --> 17:06.915
the whole nutrition... thing.

17:06.916 --> 17:08.083
Maybe you could tell me about that

17:08.124 --> 17:09.373
over some real food?

17:09.415 --> 17:11.165
There's a great Italian
place just down the street.

17:11.207 --> 17:12.330
No.

17:12.372 --> 17:13.914
No, you're gluten-free? We
could go somewhere else.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.039
Nope. Not gluten-free.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.788
Well, maybe I could just
get your card, or...

17:17.829 --> 17:18.746
your number.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.577
We could help each other, you know,

17:20.578 --> 17:22.328
you with getting me in shape,
me with your branding.

17:22.368 --> 17:23.409
Sorry. No.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.659
Actually... yes.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.241
Um... remember, no?

17:27.242 --> 17:29.867
Mel would be thrilled to
give you a consultation.

17:29.909 --> 17:31.699
That's what we do, you know,

17:31.741 --> 17:33.740
go over people's personal goals.

17:33.741 --> 17:34.823
That's great.

17:34.865 --> 17:36.406
How about Saturday?10:00 A.M.?

17:36.448 --> 17:37.822
Saturday it is.

17:37.864 --> 17:39.363
Here you go.

17:39.405 --> 17:40.405
Great.

17:40.406 --> 17:43.112
I will shoot you an email with my address,

17:43.154 --> 17:44.236
and I'll see you then.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.153
Okay.

17:45.195 --> 17:46.445
Bye.

17:46.487 --> 17:48.110
What?

17:50.735 --> 17:51.776
Take a deep breath in...

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
and release.

17:56.316 --> 17:58.899
Thank you for sharing
your practice with us today.

17:58.940 --> 18:00.523
Namaste.

18:00.565 --> 18:01.647
Namaste.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.897
Great class, everyone.

18:04.938 --> 18:06.979
See you next week, and
remember, stay active.

18:07.021 --> 18:09.562
Thank you! Bye!

18:09.604 --> 18:10.728
Bye.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.061
So you've got to get cleaned up.

18:12.102 --> 18:13.602
You've got your 10 A.M.

18:13.643 --> 18:14.934
Okay, you said shut it down,

18:14.976 --> 18:16.559
and there I was, shutting it down,

18:16.601 --> 18:18.642
and you just... started it back up.

18:18.683 --> 18:20.932
He's in marketing, Mel.
That's exactly what we need.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.807
Oh, come on, Jules. He's a salesman.

18:22.849 --> 18:24.889
It was probably, like, a line or something.

18:24.890 --> 18:26.431
Actually...

18:28.805 --> 18:30.846
he's legit.

18:30.888 --> 18:31.888
Okay, well then,

18:31.889 --> 18:33.471
why don't you give him his consultation,

18:33.512 --> 18:35.470
and maybe the two of you can
talk about all this stuff?

18:35.511 --> 18:36.677
I can't.

18:36.719 --> 18:37.886
I've got to do some errands.

18:37.927 --> 18:39.302
So you'd better hurry. You
don't want to be late.

18:42.842 --> 18:44.050
Fine...

18:44.051 --> 18:46.381
but I'm wearing the ring.

18:46.382 --> 18:48.590
This is strictly business.

19:06.126 --> 19:07.500
Come in.

19:19.039 --> 19:21.703
Looks like a rich
man's bachelor pad in here.

19:21.704 --> 19:23.620
Wow.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.161
Yeah, I guess it could
use a little redecorating.

19:27.202 --> 19:29.368
A woman's touch, maybe?

19:29.410 --> 19:31.451
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Danish?

19:31.492 --> 19:33.242
No, I'm good.

19:33.284 --> 19:34.700
Did you already eat?

19:34.742 --> 19:36.615
Yeah, sorry, I was starving.

19:36.657 --> 19:37.741
What did you have for breakfast?

19:37.782 --> 19:40.614
Uh... a macchiato from the coffee shop,

19:40.656 --> 19:41.989
and some cereal.

19:42.031 --> 19:43.696
This cereal?

19:43.697 --> 19:46.112
It's a... childhood habit.

19:46.154 --> 19:48.194
Is this what you eat every
day for breakfast?

19:48.195 --> 19:49.236
No, not every day...

19:49.278 --> 19:50.403
Okay, yes, every day,

19:50.445 --> 19:51.902
but sometimes, I also
get something at work.

19:51.944 --> 19:55.276
This will obviously have to change.

19:56.817 --> 19:58.066
So...

19:58.108 --> 20:00.983
do you ever have breakfast with Will Peters?

20:01.025 --> 20:02.024
Will?

20:02.025 --> 20:03.898
Yeah, he's my boss, but he's also a buddy.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.939
You know, we play poker, shoot hoops.

20:05.981 --> 20:07.355
So, what, your buddy struck out,

20:07.397 --> 20:09.688
and you figured you'd give
it a good old college try?

20:09.730 --> 20:11.187
I'm sorry, I have no I...

20:11.229 --> 20:12.603
You both hit on meat the party.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.019
Well, obviously.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.810
I mean, look at you. You're
beautiful and... oh...

20:16.852 --> 20:17.852
Married?

20:17.893 --> 20:18.810
Engaged.

20:18.852 --> 20:19.767
Right.

20:20.851 --> 20:21.851
What was that?

20:21.851 --> 20:22.766
Nothing.

20:22.808 --> 20:24.016
Sorry, I'm just surprised

20:24.017 --> 20:24.891
because you weren't wearing your
ring the other night.

20:24.933 --> 20:25.849
It's a bit loose,

20:25.890 --> 20:27.724
so I get nervous wearing it out.

20:27.765 --> 20:30.346
So, what are your exercise and
nutrition goals?

20:30.347 --> 20:32.139
Actually, I think I'm already pretty fit.

20:35.929 --> 20:36.846
Oh, yuck...

20:36.887 --> 20:38.011
Do you know what?

20:38.012 --> 20:39.261
Would you look at the time?
I actually have a...

20:40.885 --> 20:42.593
Sorry, I do a lot of take out. Here.

20:42.635 --> 20:44.508
I can see that.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.759
Thank you.

20:51.008 --> 20:52.007
Oh, no, no, no, no!

20:52.048 --> 20:52.923
What?

20:52.965 --> 20:54.090
Um, my ring just slipped off.

20:54.131 --> 20:55.797
This is... this is bad. This is really bad.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.047
It's okay, it's okay.

20:57.088 --> 20:59.337
It's probably just stuck in the pipe.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.003
Is it in there?

21:03.004 --> 21:04.128
You know what,

21:04.169 --> 21:05.003
you're going to have to
give me just one second.

21:05.044 --> 21:06.252
Please, I can't lose it.

21:06.294 --> 21:08.501
Yeah, I get that, but I'm
sure worst-case scenario,

21:08.543 --> 21:09.667
your fiancé would understand.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.709
That's the thing.I'm...

21:11.750 --> 21:14.624
I'm not really engaged.
I'm giving the ring back.

21:14.666 --> 21:15.708
What?

21:15.749 --> 21:16.665
Why is that?

21:16.707 --> 21:17.873
It didn't work out.

21:17.915 --> 21:19.831
So you just wear the
ring to deter guys like me?

21:19.872 --> 21:22.495
Okay, well, I've just been through a lot,

21:22.496 --> 21:23.705
and yeah,

21:23.746 --> 21:26.453
I do want to deter dating,
marriage, all of that stuff.

21:26.495 --> 21:27.495
I'm done with it all.

21:28.494 --> 21:29.577
Are you okay?

21:29.619 --> 21:31.035
Yeah.

21:32.451 --> 21:35.617
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.156
All right.

21:43.157 --> 21:45.863
Well, I guess the next steps are

21:45.905 --> 21:47.613
I will write you up a grocery list

21:47.655 --> 21:49.238
of healthy food staples,

21:49.279 --> 21:50.986
and we'll arrange a physical assessment,

21:50.987 --> 21:52.444
and take it from there.

21:52.486 --> 21:53.486
Sound good?

21:53.487 --> 21:54.652
Sure, whatever you think.

21:54.694 --> 21:55.944
Okay.

21:55.986 --> 21:58.651
Oh, no, no, it's okay. I'll
just let myself out...

21:58.693 --> 22:00.692
and thank you again for the...

22:02.274 --> 22:03.732
Don't mention it.

22:03.774 --> 22:05.607
'Kay.

22:11.772 --> 22:13.354
You should have seen the look on his face

22:13.396 --> 22:16.271
when I told him I was done with dating.

22:16.311 --> 22:17.644
It was like a balloon deflating.

22:17.645 --> 22:20.851
Well, did you at least talk to
him about our branding?

22:20.893 --> 22:22.351
No, of course not.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.434
What? I didn't want him thinking

22:24.476 --> 22:26.517
I wanted to spend more time with him.

22:26.558 --> 22:27.766
Besides, I'm pretty sure

22:27.808 --> 22:28.766
he's trying to get out of
this whole training thing

22:28.808 --> 22:29.848
anyway.

22:30.890 --> 22:32.847
All right, here's the
rest of the guest list,

22:32.889 --> 22:34.972
complete with addresses.

22:34.973 --> 22:36.637
Why don't you start handing some to me,

22:36.638 --> 22:38.346
and I will sign.

22:38.388 --> 22:39.429
Sign what?

22:39.470 --> 22:42.761
The invitations to your wedding anniversary.

22:42.803 --> 22:44.927
Whoa. Is that the guest list?

22:44.969 --> 22:48.218
Anna, I thought we agreed to keep it small.

22:48.259 --> 22:51.050
You only expect60% of those you invite

22:51.092 --> 22:52.298
to actually show up.

22:52.299 --> 22:54.715
Well, if we're going to
haveth at many people over,

22:54.757 --> 22:56.340
it was a good thing Rob was just here,

22:56.382 --> 22:57.798
cutting back the shrubs.

22:57.839 --> 22:59.129
He was?

22:59.130 --> 23:03.671
I asked him to do some landscaping out back.

23:03.712 --> 23:04.962
It's a garden party, right?

23:06.711 --> 23:09.793
He mentioned, um... you've kept the ring.

23:09.794 --> 23:12.792
I'm going to give the ring back.

23:12.793 --> 23:14.791
Oh, Mel, why?

23:14.792 --> 23:16.458
Rob's a great catch.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.041
He has his own landscaping company.

23:19.082 --> 23:20.706
He comes from a really nice family.

23:20.748 --> 23:22.455
In fact, I just saw his mother...

23:22.456 --> 23:23.539
Anna...

23:23.580 --> 23:25.413
I think Roo made her decision.

23:26.871 --> 23:28.120
Okay, fine.

23:28.162 --> 23:29.536
If neither of you girls are getting married,

23:29.578 --> 23:30.786
then I am.

23:30.787 --> 23:32.453
What?

23:32.495 --> 23:33.952
Your father and I have decided,

23:33.953 --> 23:35.618
at our wedding anniversary party,

23:35.660 --> 23:38.076
we are going to renew our vows.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.283
Aw...

23:39.325 --> 23:42.615
And we want the two of you
to stand up for us.

23:42.616 --> 23:45.281
Mom, Dad, that's amazing!

23:45.323 --> 23:46.948
That's really beautiful.

23:46.989 --> 23:49.112
Yeah, I thought so,

23:49.113 --> 23:50.155
and maybe you girls will see

23:50.197 --> 23:53.570
how special getting married can be.

23:58.277 --> 23:59.777
Hey!

23:59.818 --> 24:00.902
Hey.

24:00.943 --> 24:03.400
I'm calling a do-over.
Starting from scratch.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.442
No way.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.274
The girl has sworn off everything, for good.

24:07.316 --> 24:08.191
I mean, I should have known

24:08.233 --> 24:09.272
something was up the other night

24:09.273 --> 24:10.856
when she turned you down... but me?

24:13.189 --> 24:14.105
Oh!

24:14.147 --> 24:15.647
Nice.

24:17.479 --> 24:18.895
Wait a second. You hit on her first...

24:20.062 --> 24:21.770
which means you knew... you
knew she was damaged goods.

24:21.811 --> 24:23.144
It's not my fault you didn't ask.

24:25.352 --> 24:26.643
Nice, Will, real nice.

24:26.684 --> 24:27.809
Ah...

24:30.099 --> 24:32.599
Look, why don't you just admit defeat, okay?

24:32.641 --> 24:34.931
I'm sure you can find the
hook in Bran Buddies,

24:34.932 --> 24:36.015
be the Bran Buddy poster boy.

24:36.056 --> 24:37.680
Is that what this is about?

24:37.722 --> 24:39.929
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Check these out.

24:39.930 --> 24:41.763
I just scored a pair of court-side seats

24:41.804 --> 24:43.179
from the Juicy reps.

24:44.470 --> 24:45.678
No, you didn't.You've got Little League.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.344
Wow...

24:49.385 --> 24:51.176
some accounts have all the perks.

24:51.217 --> 24:53.591
I wonder how many perks Bran Buddies has?

24:53.592 --> 24:55.300
Fine.

24:55.342 --> 24:56.925
You know what? I'll make it happen.

24:56.966 --> 24:57.882
My man!

24:57.924 --> 24:59.589
Vince, want to go to the game?

24:59.590 --> 25:02.380
-Yeah!-Yeah!

25:02.422 --> 25:04.380
I can get out of Little League.

25:06.504 --> 25:08.462
Take a deep breath. Hands up...

25:10.836 --> 25:12.294
and Swan down...

25:12.336 --> 25:14.418
No, I'm going to take a class right now.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.751
It's already started.

25:16.792 --> 25:17.917
Bye. Bye-bye-bye.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.583
Up in the chest...

25:21.625 --> 25:23.415
Can I squeeze in between you?

25:23.457 --> 25:25.915
And when you're ready,
step back into Plank pose,

25:25.956 --> 25:28.206
and down into Cobra.

25:28.247 --> 25:29.580
Open the chest...

25:35.244 --> 25:36.743
Downward-facing dog.

25:39.535 --> 25:40.868
Take a few steps with your feet,

25:40.910 --> 25:42.617
stretch out the calves...

25:44.908 --> 25:46.866
Take a breath up.

25:46.908 --> 25:49.656
Back down... and arms up.

25:51.655 --> 25:55.321
Prayer to the heart.

25:55.362 --> 25:56.404
Breathe.

25:57.862 --> 25:59.569
Into Eagle pose.

25:59.570 --> 26:03.651
Wrap your foot around your left leg.

26:05.318 --> 26:08.025
Hands together. Bend into it.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.065
Put your left under your right.

26:10.066 --> 26:14.023
Settle in deep.Breathe.

26:14.064 --> 26:16.023
Breathe...

26:17.355 --> 26:18.813
Feel your body.

26:20.521 --> 26:21.687
And when you’re ready,

26:21.729 --> 26:25.727
uncross your arms and then your legs,

26:25.728 --> 26:27.227
and take them out of the pose...

26:30.059 --> 26:31.642
and hands to heart,

26:31.684 --> 26:34.141
Prayer pose.

26:35.308 --> 26:37.181
Thank you so much for coming today.

26:37.223 --> 26:38.515
Namaste.

26:38.557 --> 26:39.389
Namaste.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.680
-Thank you!-Thank you!

26:41.722 --> 26:43.597
-Thank you so much.-Namaste. Namaste!

26:43.638 --> 26:45.887
Namaste!

26:45.888 --> 26:48.385
'Kay, thank you so much, everyone!

26:48.386 --> 26:50.261
Have a great week! We'll see you soon. Bye!

26:50.303 --> 26:51.343
Wow.

26:53.177 --> 26:54.759
This is a really great set-up you guys have.

26:54.801 --> 26:55.800
You think?

26:55.842 --> 26:57.967
Actually, we're looking for a bigger space.

26:58.009 --> 26:59.382
Really?

26:59.383 --> 27:00.924
I love this whole home vibe thing.

27:00.966 --> 27:02.882
I think it really works with
your sister act.

27:02.923 --> 27:04.547
-You think?-Yeah, for sure.

27:04.548 --> 27:05.713
You know, if you were
thinking of branding,

27:05.714 --> 27:07.213
that's the whole approach I would take.

27:08.504 --> 27:09.545
If you wanted,

27:09.546 --> 27:11.544
I could do up, like, a social media pitch,

27:11.545 --> 27:13.420
press kit...

27:13.461 --> 27:16.002
That's a great idea! Right, Mel?

27:16.043 --> 27:18.543
Uh, did you get my grocery list?

27:18.585 --> 27:21.374
I did. There's just one problem.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.625
I get it.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.708
It's probably too complicated,
what with your lifestyle,

27:24.749 --> 27:25.707
so if you don't want

27:25.748 --> 27:26.915
to go through with this whole thing,

27:26.957 --> 27:29.622
I completely understand.

27:29.664 --> 27:31.538
No, that's not it. I just...

27:31.539 --> 27:34.037
I wouldn't have the first
clue where to find, uh...

27:34.079 --> 27:35.162
chia seeds,

27:35.204 --> 27:37.661
or... broccolini?

27:37.703 --> 27:38.786
I don't even know what that looks like.

27:38.828 --> 27:40.286
Is that, like, a little mini broccoli?

27:40.327 --> 27:42.200
It's actually a cross

27:42.201 --> 27:43.867
between asparagus and broccoli.

27:43.868 --> 27:45.867
See? No clue.

27:46.867 --> 27:47.908
I was thinking,

27:47.950 --> 27:49.199
maybe we could go grocery shopping together.

27:49.241 --> 27:50.699
Together?

27:50.740 --> 27:52.115
No, no, we don't have to do that.

27:52.157 --> 27:53.363
Actually, I can order the food

27:53.364 --> 27:55.030
and have it delivered right to you.

27:55.072 --> 27:56.362
Sure,

27:56.363 --> 27:58.904
but I probably should learn how
to do it myself, right?

27:58.946 --> 28:00.404
I mean, the only aisle I'm familiar with

28:00.445 --> 28:01.237
is the freezer aisle.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.820
Well, he's got a point.

28:02.862 --> 28:05.902
Jules, why don't you go ahead and
take Damon grocery shopping,

28:05.944 --> 28:08.525
seeing as how we've got this
whole sister act thing

28:08.526 --> 28:09.734
going on.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.191
Hey, Mel.

28:16.023 --> 28:18.439
Rob! Hi.

28:18.481 --> 28:19.522
What are you doing here?

28:19.564 --> 28:20.564
Thought I'd come by

28:20.605 --> 28:21.605
and see if you wanted to go for a jog.

28:21.647 --> 28:23.813
Remember our Sunday 10Ks?

28:24.770 --> 28:27.519
Yeah, I do, but, um...

28:27.520 --> 28:29.977
actually, I was just about to go take Damon,

28:30.018 --> 28:31.810
our new client, grocery shopping.

28:31.852 --> 28:33.976
Right? Are you good to go?

28:34.017 --> 28:36.100
Yeah, sure, I can... I'll shower later.

28:36.141 --> 28:37.142
Okay, great.

28:37.183 --> 28:37.850
Yeah.

28:37.891 --> 28:40.224
10K? That's impressive.

28:45.472 --> 28:48.388
You want an energy bar for your run?

28:53.511 --> 28:54.553
Hi.

28:55.718 --> 28:57.135
This is broccolini.

28:57.176 --> 28:58.009
Oh!

28:58.051 --> 28:59.675
What do you do with it?

28:59.676 --> 29:01.633
You can steam it, sauté it...

29:01.675 --> 29:03.424
Maybe you could show me some time.

29:03.466 --> 29:07.589
Don't worry, I'll make sure you
get a step-by-step recipe.

29:07.631 --> 29:08.506
Are you sure?

29:08.548 --> 29:09.548
'Cause I'm really not a good cook.

29:09.588 --> 29:12.170
My... my mom, she never taught me,

29:12.171 --> 29:14.087
not that she was much of a cook anyway.

29:14.128 --> 29:16.378
Actually, I usually ate alone,

29:16.419 --> 29:18.961
but me and the pizza guy,
we got pretty chummy.

29:19.002 --> 29:21.334
Why were you alone so much?

29:21.335 --> 29:23.334
My mom, she worked a lot,

29:23.376 --> 29:24.667
and Dad wasn't really around.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.832
Well, I love pizza.

29:28.833 --> 29:29.957
Really?

29:29.998 --> 29:32.122
Like, whole wheat with soy
cheese or something?

29:32.164 --> 29:33.830
That kind of thing?

29:33.831 --> 29:34.996
No.

29:35.038 --> 29:37.995
Extra cheese, double the
meat, mushrooms, and olives.

29:38.037 --> 29:39.453
I love olives on my pizza.

29:39.495 --> 29:41.411
It brings out the flavor in
the salami or something.

29:41.453 --> 29:42.661
Exactly.

29:43.536 --> 29:44.827
So Rob, he's your...?

29:45.868 --> 29:46.743
Ex-fiancé.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.159
I guess he didn't get the memo.

29:48.201 --> 29:51.157
Which is odd, because I feel like
leaving him at the altar

29:51.158 --> 29:52.741
was sending a pretty big message.

29:52.783 --> 29:54.656
Suppose he's not The One?

29:54.657 --> 29:56.490
Nope... whatever that means.

29:56.532 --> 29:57.655
You're telling me you don't
believe in soulmates

29:57.656 --> 29:58.781
and all that?

29:59.863 --> 30:00.905
Why? Do you?

30:00.947 --> 30:02.695
Yeah, yeah, of course.

30:03.487 --> 30:04.861
Have you ever met The One?

30:04.903 --> 30:07.528
Not yet, but...

30:07.569 --> 30:09.610
still looking.

30:09.652 --> 30:11.692
Off to the grain section.

30:13.609 --> 30:15.649
Now, you're going to want to look for

30:15.650 --> 30:17.399
whole grains, not refined.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.649
Have you always been into all this?

30:19.690 --> 30:21.273
Are you kidding me?

30:21.314 --> 30:23.314
I was the awkward, unhealthy kid.

30:23.356 --> 30:24.522
I loved candy bars.

30:24.563 --> 30:26.063
Thank you.

30:30.311 --> 30:31.936
Great, let's check out some fruit.

30:31.977 --> 30:33.560
All right, the good stuff.

30:33.602 --> 30:34.519
Apples, yeah...

30:34.560 --> 30:36.475
Oh, sorry! Sorry! Uh...

30:36.476 --> 30:37.684
Mel?

30:38.683 --> 30:40.307
Justin! Hi! How are you?

30:40.308 --> 30:42.100
Great.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.349
I was going to call you about
your running group.

30:43.390 --> 30:45.723
Kelly says we need to start doing something,

30:45.765 --> 30:47.597
'cause you know what they say,

30:47.639 --> 30:49.138
the couple that runs together

30:49.180 --> 30:50.096
stays together.

30:50.138 --> 30:52.387
Is that what we should have done?

30:52.429 --> 30:54.261
I'm kidding.

30:54.303 --> 30:55.512
Right.

30:55.553 --> 30:58.135
So we'll just go online and sign up.

30:58.177 --> 30:59.802
Absolutely. I'll see you on the track.

31:01.801 --> 31:02.717
Hey, bud,

31:02.759 --> 31:05.008
there's some spilt juice by the smoothies.

31:08.757 --> 31:10.089
Who was that guy?

31:10.131 --> 31:12.422
Oh, that was Justin...

31:12.464 --> 31:15.755
my, uh... my first fiancé.

31:15.797 --> 31:17.837
You were engaged before Rob?

31:17.879 --> 31:18.920
Twice, actually.

31:18.961 --> 31:20.920
Three times. You've been
engaged three times?

31:20.961 --> 31:21.835
Mm-hmm.

31:21.877 --> 31:24.210
Well, it looks like we’re done here,

31:24.251 --> 31:26.251
so I'm just going to get going.

31:27.209 --> 31:29.083
Yes, do you want me to drive you or...?

31:29.125 --> 31:30.916
Oh, no, it's okay. I'll walk.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.248
I didn't go for that run, so...

31:33.290 --> 31:34.831
I will see you for your assessment.

31:34.873 --> 31:36.247
Yes.

31:36.289 --> 31:38.164
Okay.

31:45.620 --> 31:46.951
Three dudes have proposed to her,

31:46.952 --> 31:49.077
and she said yes every time.

31:49.118 --> 31:50.035
Isn't that good?

31:50.077 --> 31:51.451
I mean, she's said "yes" three times,

31:51.493 --> 31:53.408
so a fourth should be no big deal, right?

31:53.450 --> 31:54.325
No, it's not good

31:54.366 --> 31:55.741
because she didn't marry any of them,

31:55.783 --> 31:57.657
and I'm guessing that's
why she’s thrown in the towel.

31:57.699 --> 31:58.947
Sounds like you should start working

31:58.948 --> 32:00.113
on the Bran Buddies account.

32:00.114 --> 32:02.739
Three pulled pork tacos,
please, extra hot sauce.

32:02.781 --> 32:03.780
Have you asked her

32:03.781 --> 32:05.404
why it didn't work outwith the first three?

32:05.446 --> 32:06.362
Are you kidding?

32:06.404 --> 32:07.779
I mean, I could tell she was embarrassed.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.777
Plus... what if it's her?

32:09.778 --> 32:11.152
You know, what if
there’s something wrong with her?

32:11.194 --> 32:13.194
She looked fine to me.

32:13.235 --> 32:15.108
You should dig a little deeper.

32:15.109 --> 32:16.484
I mean, women love it

32:16.525 --> 32:18.108
when you seem interested in them.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.149
Susan thinks I'm right into her Reiki,

32:20.191 --> 32:22.440
when really, I don’t understand it at all.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.523
Who does?

32:23.565 --> 32:25.272
Well, she likes olives.

32:25.273 --> 32:26.606
Wow, good for you.

32:26.647 --> 32:28.771
You're really getting to
know her, aren't you.

32:28.772 --> 32:29.813
Thank you!

32:31.645 --> 32:32.729
What a guy.

32:33.853 --> 32:34.935
Keep breathing. Legs up.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.102
Okay, toss the ball. Right?

32:36.144 --> 32:37.186
All right.

32:37.227 --> 32:38.809
Catch.

32:38.851 --> 32:39.893
Nice. Toss it back.

32:39.934 --> 32:40.768
Okay.

32:40.809 --> 32:41.768
Keep breathing, breathing...

32:41.808 --> 32:42.892
I'm giving you a weight now.

32:42.933 --> 32:44.558
Easy.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.598
You've obviously got a strong core.

32:46.599 --> 32:48.390
Let's go down to the
ground and do the Pigeon.

32:48.432 --> 32:49.723
Okay, follow me.

32:50.764 --> 32:52.388
Right leg forward, left leg back,

32:52.430 --> 32:53.597
go down onto your elbows.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.679
Breathe. You feel that stretch?

32:55.721 --> 32:57.179
Oh, I feel that.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.428
All right, Bendy, can you do this?

33:01.927 --> 33:03.218
Oh, impressive, hot shot...

33:03.260 --> 33:05.800
but my dad can do that.

33:05.842 --> 33:06.759
Can your dad do...

33:06.800 --> 33:08.633
this?

33:10.507 --> 33:12.007
Nope, but my Scouts can.

33:12.048 --> 33:12.923
Oh.

33:12.924 --> 33:14.255
All right, can you do this?

33:14.256 --> 33:15.921
Right leg forward, left leg back.

33:15.922 --> 33:17.088
Okay.

33:17.130 --> 33:19.420
Knee, uh... an inch above the ground.

33:19.421 --> 33:20.379
Right there, yeah.

33:20.421 --> 33:21.420
We're going to test your stability.

33:21.421 --> 33:22.754
I'm going to push you, okay? Ready?

33:22.795 --> 33:24.419
Yeah, how's that for stable?

33:24.461 --> 33:25.377
'Kay.

33:25.419 --> 33:26.544
Don't hurt your fingers.

33:26.586 --> 33:27.543
Ready?

33:27.585 --> 33:29.126
Yep.

33:29.168 --> 33:30.500
That's Choco Puff power.

33:30.542 --> 33:31.375
Yeah?

33:31.417 --> 33:33.708
How's this for vegetable power?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.082
Yeah?

33:35.124 --> 33:36.291
Well, let's check your stability,

33:36.332 --> 33:37.873
-Vegetable power.-Oof!

33:39.831 --> 33:41.456
Uh... ooh...

33:43.121 --> 33:44.329
-Your knee?-Yeah.

33:44.371 --> 33:45.163
You all right?

33:45.204 --> 33:46.412
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

33:46.454 --> 33:47.661
Mm...

33:47.703 --> 33:50.035
It's okay. It should be fine now.

33:50.077 --> 33:51.243
I don't know about that.

33:51.244 --> 33:52.618
You really should rest
it the first few hours.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.909
I think I know what I'm doing.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.742
Okay, that's it. You're staying...

33:57.783 --> 34:00.073
at least until the swelling goes down.

34:00.074 --> 34:01.781
Fine.

34:11.902 --> 34:14.194
Pizza's not
usually on the health menu.

34:14.235 --> 34:15.485
It is tonight.

34:15.527 --> 34:17.068
Doesn't hurt to cheat every now and then.

34:17.985 --> 34:19.692
This is so good.

34:20.817 --> 34:22.024
What? Do I have something on my face?

34:22.065 --> 34:24.232
No, it's just me. I, uh...

34:25.274 --> 34:28.106
I just like when people surprise me.

34:29.063 --> 34:30.230
So tell me something about yourself.

34:30.272 --> 34:31.313
Is it just you and your sister,

34:31.355 --> 34:33.187
or... you have family here?

34:33.228 --> 34:34.228
My parents are here.

34:34.228 --> 34:35.187
They're actually celebrating

34:35.228 --> 34:36.645
their 30-year wedding anniversary

34:36.687 --> 34:37.728
in a month.

34:37.768 --> 34:39.143
Really? Wow, that's amazing.

34:39.185 --> 34:40.476
What about your parents?

34:40.518 --> 34:42.560
They're celebrating20
years of being divorced.

34:44.016 --> 34:44.891
Is that why your dad wasn’t around?

34:44.934 --> 34:46.808
Yeah, that would be why...

34:47.725 --> 34:49.306
but my mom did the best she could.

34:49.349 --> 34:50.723
You know, she worked a lot of night shifts,

34:50.724 --> 34:52.556
but she always made a point to
have breakfast with me.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.097
A bowl of Choco Pops, every morning.

34:57.763 --> 34:58.886
You mentioned Scouts earlier.

34:58.887 --> 35:00.886
You a leader, or just a really tall Scout?

35:00.928 --> 35:02.052
I volunteer at the community center

35:02.053 --> 35:03.012
on Tuesdays.

35:03.052 --> 35:04.094
Were you a Scout?

35:04.136 --> 35:05.677
Straight through to Explorer.

35:15.465 --> 35:17.339
This was right after I
got my survival badge.

35:17.381 --> 35:18.381
Oh!

35:18.382 --> 35:19.880
-That's a tough one to get.-Yeah.

35:19.922 --> 35:23.046
These guys were like the
brothers I never had.

35:24.671 --> 35:28.294
I promise to always do my best,

35:28.336 --> 35:32.208
to keep myself strong in mind and body,

35:32.209 --> 35:33.543
to always help those in need,

35:33.584 --> 35:35.999
and to help myself through positivity

35:36.041 --> 35:37.125
and good values.

35:37.166 --> 35:39.082
I'm impressed.

35:39.124 --> 35:40.165
Thanks.

35:40.207 --> 35:42.372
Hey...

35:42.373 --> 35:43.747
I know it wasn’t on the grocery list,

35:43.789 --> 35:44.831
but I happen to have some ice cream

35:44.872 --> 35:46.037
in the freezer.

35:46.038 --> 35:47.912
Now, I know you said to get
rid of all that stuff,

35:47.954 --> 35:50.453
but come on, it's ice cream.

35:51.869 --> 35:53.535
Well, it does have calcium.

35:53.536 --> 35:55.576
Especially if you put whipped cream on top.

35:55.618 --> 35:57.201
Oh, I have got whipped cream.

35:57.243 --> 35:59.076
I'll make us a couple sundaes?

35:59.117 --> 36:00.366
I love it.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.866
Good.

36:17.695 --> 36:18.986
You know, you are turning out

36:19.027 --> 36:21.026
to be the best
personal-trainer slash-nutritionist ever.

36:34.355 --> 36:35.896
So you hurt your knee,

36:35.938 --> 36:38.062
and then you stayed over and had dinner

36:38.104 --> 36:39.728
together with Damon.

36:39.770 --> 36:41.352
No... I mean, yeah,

36:41.353 --> 36:42.894
but it wasn’t like that.

36:42.936 --> 36:44.060
You know,

36:44.102 --> 36:45.018
the first few hours after an
injury are crucial,

36:45.060 --> 36:46.060
so I was doing the right thing.

36:46.102 --> 36:47.101
Uh-huh.

36:47.142 --> 36:50.475
Don't "uh-huh" me, Jules. He's a client...

36:50.517 --> 36:52.849
one that you insisted we take on.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.682
Besides, even if I was interested,

36:54.723 --> 36:56.056
which I am not,

36:56.098 --> 36:57.430
I doubt it would go anywhere,

36:57.472 --> 36:59.721
because his parents
divorced when he was younger,

36:59.763 --> 37:01.262
and I can tell by the way he talks about it,

37:01.304 --> 37:03.595
he still has some serious issues from it.

37:03.637 --> 37:04.553
Actually, I wouldn't be surprised

37:04.595 --> 37:05.844
if he was scared of marriage.

37:05.886 --> 37:08.343
Then you don't have anything
to worry about...

37:08.344 --> 37:10.342
you know, with you two hanging out

37:10.343 --> 37:12.176
and eating pizza.

37:12.218 --> 37:13.258
Exactly.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.591
Actually, I kind of just feel bad for him.

37:15.633 --> 37:16.799
I mean, it'd be sad

37:16.840 --> 37:18.506
if he was putting off getting married.

37:18.507 --> 37:20.256
Who's putting off getting married?

37:20.298 --> 37:21.256
Me.

37:21.297 --> 37:22.422
Damon.

37:22.464 --> 37:23.505
Sweetheart, don't say that.

37:23.506 --> 37:26.921
I mean, wait... look what I had fixed.

37:26.962 --> 37:29.002
If this can be fixed, so
can your relationship.

37:29.003 --> 37:29.962
Mom, why did you do that?

37:30.003 --> 37:32.002
Now, now, now, don't bug Mom

37:32.044 --> 37:33.335
because she changed your ex's name

37:33.377 --> 37:35.000
on the cheese board.

37:35.001 --> 37:36.001
Speaking of cheese board,

37:36.043 --> 37:38.000
let's put some cheese on there, huh?

37:40.375 --> 37:42.374
Who's this Damon your sister mentioned?

37:42.415 --> 37:43.540
Hmm?

37:43.582 --> 37:45.247
Oh, he's just a client.

37:45.289 --> 37:46.373
Single client?

37:46.414 --> 37:47.622
I don't know. Is he?

37:47.664 --> 37:48.829
I don't know.

37:48.830 --> 37:49.788
You know what?

37:49.829 --> 37:51.080
Let's go help Jules with that cheese

37:51.121 --> 37:52.663
because I am suddenly so hungry.

37:55.911 --> 38:00.284
She is in unreal shape. It's insane.

38:00.326 --> 38:01.493
She was doing these abs
things like they're nothing.

38:01.534 --> 38:02.659
I'm going to be hurting for a week!

38:02.700 --> 38:04.157
So she's doing all these moves, right,

38:04.158 --> 38:06.574
trying to impress me with
these exercise moves,

38:06.616 --> 38:07.949
and she, like, blows out her knee,

38:07.990 --> 38:10.614
so we just end up eating pizza...

38:10.656 --> 38:13.489
uh, with olives, obviously,

38:13.530 --> 38:15.154
and they were black, not green.

38:15.196 --> 38:16.237
You should have seen her.

38:16.279 --> 38:17.154
It was awesome.

38:17.196 --> 38:19.570
She had, like, five slices.

38:20.611 --> 38:21.653
Oh, and then,

38:21.694 --> 38:24.568
I find out that she used to
be a Scout, like me,

38:24.610 --> 38:28.108
only she still does it, like...
a volunteer, you know?

38:28.150 --> 38:29.025
How nice is that?

38:29.067 --> 38:31.315
Are you going to bowl or what?

38:31.316 --> 38:32.481
Right.

38:32.482 --> 38:34.814
Well, I'm glad you
took my advice to heart.

38:34.856 --> 38:37.189
I mean, when you start
falling for someone...

38:37.230 --> 38:38.355
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:38.396 --> 38:39.978
Okay, no one is falling for anybody,

38:39.979 --> 38:41.979
all right?

38:42.020 --> 38:43.187
It's like you said.

38:43.228 --> 38:45.143
I don't even know what she's into, you know,

38:45.144 --> 38:46.518
if we're going to have anything in common.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.477
It's just... hit or miss.

38:48.518 --> 38:50.768
Just sometimes... I hit it.

38:50.809 --> 38:51.892
Like this...

38:57.432 --> 38:59.098
Oh! Yes!

38:59.140 --> 39:00.139
I am on a winning streak.

39:00.181 --> 39:01.264
Unbelievable.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.553
Okay, we are going to start working

39:09.595 --> 39:11.968
on our friendship badges.

39:12.010 --> 39:13.509
No better way to do that

39:13.551 --> 39:17.508
than to start with working and
making friendship bracelets.

39:17.550 --> 39:20.174
This is everything you’re going to need.

39:20.215 --> 39:23.214
This is for your table.
You can take that back.

39:23.256 --> 39:25.173
All right, have fun!

39:34.461 --> 39:35.336
Avery...

39:35.377 --> 39:36.543
why not join the other girls

39:36.585 --> 39:38.501
and make a friendship bracelet, too?

39:43.083 --> 39:45.333
Oh, no thanks. I'd rather not.

39:46.874 --> 39:50.456
Besides, I won't have a
friend to give it to anyway.

39:50.497 --> 39:53.455
Avery... just try.

39:53.496 --> 39:54.954
Please make a bracelet.

39:56.537 --> 39:57.952
You will arena nifty badge,

39:57.953 --> 40:00.369
and it will come in handy one day...

40:00.411 --> 40:02.035
and I promise,

40:02.076 --> 40:03.868
you will have a friend to give it to.

40:05.867 --> 40:07.658
Okay.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.240
What do you think? Blue? It's so pretty.

40:12.157 --> 40:13.115
Okay...

40:13.116 --> 40:17.030
Today, we're going to be Good Samaritans,

40:17.071 --> 40:18.904
as we should be every day,

40:18.946 --> 40:21.904
and we are going to now
work on our environment badges

40:21.945 --> 40:23.111
by going outside

40:23.153 --> 40:25.111
and cleaning up the park next
to our community center.

40:25.152 --> 40:27.110
So everybody grab a pair of gloves!

40:28.693 --> 40:30.525
Okay, does everyone have a pair of gloves?

40:30.567 --> 40:31.358
Yeah!

40:31.400 --> 40:32.442
You know, actually...

40:32.483 --> 40:34.357
I don't.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.857
Could I borrow a pair?

40:42.855 --> 40:44.021
Oh, thank you!

40:45.979 --> 40:47.520
Just a second, girls.

40:48.561 --> 40:50.102
What are you doing here?

40:50.144 --> 40:51.476
I'm volunteering.

40:51.518 --> 40:52.601
Uh, well,

40:52.602 --> 40:54.392
technically, I'm training to
become a volunteer.

40:54.434 --> 40:55.559
Right now, I'm on probation,

40:55.601 --> 40:57.391
but I'm sure with you as
my coach, I'll pass.

40:57.433 --> 40:59.057
Right?

41:00.599 --> 41:02.097
Is this something new, or...

41:02.098 --> 41:04.139
You inspired me.

41:04.180 --> 41:06.305
So here I am.

41:08.013 --> 41:08.929
All right,

41:08.930 --> 41:10.304
but don't think I'll go easy on you.

41:10.345 --> 41:11.803
Hey, you've already put me through
the gears as my trainer,

41:11.845 --> 41:14.344
so I wouldn't expect anything less.

41:14.386 --> 41:15.594
Good.

41:15.635 --> 41:19.091
Okay, girls, this is your new
Scout leader-in-training,

41:19.092 --> 41:20.092
Mr. Damon.

41:21.050 --> 41:21.924
Hi, Mr. Damon.

41:21.925 --> 41:23.257
Pleasure to meet you. May I say,

41:23.258 --> 41:25.591
you all look very smashing in your uniforms.

41:25.632 --> 41:27.590
Okay, everyone, find a partner.

41:27.631 --> 41:29.256
Pair up and let's go.

41:29.298 --> 41:31.422
Okay, Eva, you want to be my partner?

41:33.421 --> 41:35.587
That's Avery. She always
has such a hard time.

41:35.628 --> 41:36.918
Give me a minute.

41:36.919 --> 41:38.003
Yeah.

41:40.502 --> 41:43.667
Avery, please join the other girls in line.

41:47.958 --> 41:49.374
They don't like me.

41:49.416 --> 41:51.748
It's okay. I'll be right there with you.

41:55.830 --> 41:57.121
Avery, did you give
me tiny gloves on purpose?

41:57.162 --> 41:58.954
Hey, listen.

41:58.996 --> 42:01.744
It's my first day, and
I'm a little nervous.

42:01.786 --> 42:02.828
Would you mind showing me the ropes?

42:02.870 --> 42:04.327
-Yeah, okay.-Okay?

42:06.118 --> 42:07.326
Avery, you can walk with me

42:07.368 --> 42:09.242
and help me keep an eye on Mr. Damon.

42:09.284 --> 42:10.783
Yeah, okay.

42:10.825 --> 42:12.407
Okay, girls!

42:12.408 --> 42:13.906
Uh, Mia, Lisa, lead the way out.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.073
Let's go! Let's go!

42:17.322 --> 42:18.364
Avery, maybe outside,

42:18.406 --> 42:21.029
you can join Mia and Lisa and be a trio.

42:26.361 --> 42:28.402
So what's the story there?

42:28.403 --> 42:30.818
Avery?

42:30.859 --> 42:32.734
She's just really shy.

42:32.776 --> 42:35.650
She gets bullied at school,
that kind of thing.

42:35.692 --> 42:36.774
Her parents figured

42:36.816 --> 42:38.315
this would be a positive
environment for her.

42:38.357 --> 42:41.023
Well, it worked for me.

42:42.897 --> 42:44.814
So how many badges did
you end up collecting?

42:44.856 --> 42:46.688
21.

42:46.729 --> 42:47.604
Impressive.

42:47.646 --> 42:49.520
Mm-hmm. What about you?

42:49.562 --> 42:50.353
Just shy of 18.

42:50.395 --> 42:52.602
Oh, not bad, not bad.

42:53.519 --> 42:54.977
I wanted to get more,

42:55.018 --> 42:56.601
especially the leadership badge.

42:57.850 --> 43:00.683
I was working towards that
one when my parents split, so...

43:01.891 --> 43:03.432
had to give it up.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.889
You know, no one to take me...

43:06.931 --> 43:09.264
I figured my mom could use the
help around the house.

43:10.930 --> 43:12.720
Put the Scout training to work, you know?

43:12.762 --> 43:14.386
Helped with the garbage, the lawn...

43:14.387 --> 43:18.344
Well, I'm sure your
mom appreciated all that you did.

43:21.343 --> 43:24.216
Maybe we can start working on
your culinary badge.

43:24.217 --> 43:26.466
You did get my recipes, right?

43:26.508 --> 43:27.715
Yes, I did.

43:27.757 --> 43:29.632
Going to try out the first one tonight.

43:30.714 --> 43:32.213
Okay!

43:32.214 --> 43:34.212
How about we play a game of "it" tag?

43:34.213 --> 43:35.338
Guess who's it?

43:35.380 --> 43:36.504
I am!

43:37.712 --> 43:38.920
Oh, no!

43:38.962 --> 43:41.253
I'm going to get you, I'm going to get you!

43:53.499 --> 43:54.832
You're it! She's it!

44:15.033 --> 44:15.908
Mel!

44:15.950 --> 44:18.698
I'll be right back, okay?

44:20.406 --> 44:22.364
All right, come here.

44:23.364 --> 44:25.071
Rob...

44:25.112 --> 44:26.112
what are you doing here?

44:26.154 --> 44:27.154
I just landed

44:27.196 --> 44:29.278
the community center landscaping project.

44:29.320 --> 44:30.361
It's big.

44:30.402 --> 44:32.069
They're landscaping their entire property.

44:32.110 --> 44:33.443
Wow, that's great.

44:35.526 --> 44:36.526
What's your client doing here?

44:36.567 --> 44:37.733
Damon?

44:37.775 --> 44:40.233
Oh, he's training to become a Scout leader.

44:40.274 --> 44:41.523
For girls?

44:41.524 --> 44:43.607
Men can be Scout leaders, too.

44:43.649 --> 44:45.898
In fact, Chloe's
dad volunteered all last year.

44:45.939 --> 44:47.605
Oh, Damon has a kid?

44:47.647 --> 44:49.230
No.

44:49.271 --> 44:50.396
He's not even married.

44:50.437 --> 44:51.937
Oh, really?

44:51.978 --> 44:53.686
Time out, time out!

44:53.728 --> 44:54.894
Well, look,

44:54.936 --> 44:56.519
I wanted to talk to you about
setting another date.

44:56.560 --> 44:57.976
Date?

44:58.018 --> 45:00.559
Nothing too soon from now or anything.

45:00.601 --> 45:01.809
Rob, I...

45:03.183 --> 45:05.266
I don't know. We talked about this.

45:06.349 --> 45:09.431
Girls, I've got an idea

45:09.473 --> 45:11.097
as to who might really like to be it,

45:11.139 --> 45:14.012
but you're going to have to
help me convince her, okay?

45:14.013 --> 45:16.387
I know, and I told you,
I'm not giving up on us.

45:16.429 --> 45:18.345
Just think how happy it
will make your mother.

45:18.386 --> 45:20.636
Plus, we make a really good team.

45:20.677 --> 45:22.676
Rob...

45:22.718 --> 45:25.343
I don't want to just make a good team.

45:25.384 --> 45:26.342
I want...

45:26.342 --> 45:27.300
What?

45:28.591 --> 45:29.883
Hey, what are you guys doing?

45:29.925 --> 45:31.049
You're "it".

45:31.090 --> 45:32.799
Oh, I am, am I?

45:33.840 --> 45:35.173
Mel...

45:35.215 --> 45:36.505
I'm sorry, Rob, this is their time,

45:36.506 --> 45:38.922
but we'll chat later, okay?

45:40.379 --> 45:41.837
I'm going to get you!

45:41.879 --> 45:43.795
She's it, she's it!

45:43.836 --> 45:46.085
Girls, your moms are here,

45:46.127 --> 45:47.667
so make sure you have everything.

45:47.668 --> 45:48.792
Great job today.

45:49.667 --> 45:52.083
Bye, girls! Bye!

45:52.125 --> 45:54.124
You did all right today.

45:54.166 --> 45:55.374
Well, thank you,

45:55.416 --> 45:56.831
and hey, I'm sorry about earlier,

45:56.832 --> 45:58.748
but it kind of looked
like you needed an out.

45:58.790 --> 45:59.955
Right.

46:01.331 --> 46:02.330
So, uh...

46:02.331 --> 46:04.829
when did you realize that
Rob and the other...

46:04.871 --> 46:05.829
is it two?

46:05.871 --> 46:08.286
Yes, there are just three, thankfully.

46:08.328 --> 46:09.952
Right.

46:09.994 --> 46:11.785
When did you realize you
should have said no?

46:11.827 --> 46:13.951
I'm pretty sure I knew even
before they proposed.

46:13.993 --> 46:16.491
It was just so overwhelming when they did.

46:16.492 --> 46:17.824
I mean, Justin,

46:17.825 --> 46:19.449
he did it over the loudspeaker

46:19.491 --> 46:21.032
of the store that he managed.

46:21.073 --> 46:23.489
Darren did it while
reporting on the weather,

46:23.490 --> 46:25.822
and Rob was in front of a packed spin class.

46:25.864 --> 46:26.905
Ouch.

46:26.946 --> 46:28.030
I know, right?

46:28.071 --> 46:29.986
And then my mom, she tried to convince me

46:29.987 --> 46:31.945
that I would grow to
love them in "that way,"

46:31.987 --> 46:33.278
but I didn't.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.944
And what way is that?

46:34.986 --> 46:36.152
You know, the way you should feel

46:36.194 --> 46:37.152
when they propose...

46:37.153 --> 46:39.692
that giddy feeling knowing

46:39.734 --> 46:41.816
you'll get to spend the rest of
your life with this person

46:41.858 --> 46:44.981
that makes you believe in
happily ever after.

46:44.982 --> 46:46.773
That way.

46:53.229 --> 46:56.853
Wow, you look all fancy for taco night.

46:56.895 --> 46:59.852
Actually, I am not going to
Mom and Dad's tonight.

46:59.894 --> 47:00.977
I have a date.

47:01.810 --> 47:04.018
Really? Is it someone I know?

47:04.059 --> 47:05.850
Ian, from running group.

47:05.892 --> 47:08.807
Oh, Jules, that's so great. He
seems like such a sweet guy.

47:08.849 --> 47:10.141
Yeah.

47:10.182 --> 47:12.098
It's been such a long time, I
hope I remember how it's done.

47:12.140 --> 47:16.137
Mm, just be yourself,
and it will be amazing.

47:16.138 --> 47:17.263
Thanks.

47:17.305 --> 47:18.637
Hey, um, keep your phone on you

47:18.679 --> 47:21.428
in case I need to send you a "help me" text.

47:21.470 --> 47:22.886
I got you.

47:22.927 --> 47:24.760
Have fun.

47:27.968 --> 47:31.467
Okay, season lean chicken breast...

47:36.631 --> 47:39.630
and then pop in the oven for 10 minutes.

47:39.672 --> 47:41.297
Okay.

47:45.212 --> 47:46.670
Now... you.

47:46.712 --> 47:48.335
Oil pan...

47:52.293 --> 47:53.460
and...

47:53.500 --> 47:55.208
trim ends of the broccolini.

48:02.457 --> 48:03.456
Okay!

48:03.497 --> 48:05.038
Done!

48:07.663 --> 48:10.078
Hashtag, master chef.

48:19.867 --> 48:20.783
Yes!

48:20.825 --> 48:22.408
Yes, yes!

48:39.943 --> 48:42.068
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

48:47.524 --> 48:49.940
Oh, no, no, no, no! No, no, no!

48:54.272 --> 48:56.188
Come on, come on...

49:11.808 --> 49:12.683
Hey, Damon.

49:12.723 --> 49:14.431
I just set my kitchen on fire.

49:14.432 --> 49:15.598
Oh, no!

49:15.640 --> 49:16.681
Yeah.

49:16.722 --> 49:17.889
I was trying one of the recipes you gave me,

49:17.931 --> 49:21.304
and then there was smoke and fire

49:21.346 --> 49:22.721
and my alarm going off.

49:22.762 --> 49:25.345
Oh, I'm so sorry.

49:25.387 --> 49:26.469
Maybe you were right,

49:26.511 --> 49:28.219
and I should have helped
you out the first time.

49:28.261 --> 49:30.759
No, it's not you. It's, uh...

49:30.801 --> 49:31.925
just...

49:31.926 --> 49:33.259
now I'm forced to order take-out again,

49:33.300 --> 49:35.424
so I was...

49:35.425 --> 49:37.632
wondering if you... if
you wanted to join me?

49:37.674 --> 49:39.256
Actually, I can't.

49:39.257 --> 49:41.172
It's taco night at my parents' house.

49:41.214 --> 49:42.588
Tacos, huh?

49:42.589 --> 49:43.672
I love tacos.

49:43.713 --> 49:44.714
Me and my buddies, we hit the truck

49:44.755 --> 49:45.754
at least twice a week.

49:45.796 --> 49:47.504
Well...

49:47.546 --> 49:50.336
would you maybe want to join us?

49:50.378 --> 49:52.086
I mean, what kind of nutritionist

49:52.128 --> 49:53.293
would I be anyway

49:53.335 --> 49:55.043
if I sent you off to some
greasy take-out joint?

49:55.085 --> 49:56.167
You have a point.

49:56.209 --> 49:58.750
Great. I will come by and pick you up.

49:58.792 --> 49:59.750
Okay, see you soon.

49:59.751 --> 50:01.041
Bye.

50:10.496 --> 50:12.245
Who shoots hoops?

50:12.246 --> 50:13.745
Oh, that's me and my dad.

50:13.787 --> 50:15.077
After dinner, we usually come outside

50:15.078 --> 50:16.619
and play a little one-on-one.

50:16.661 --> 50:17.742
Yeah, you any good?

50:17.743 --> 50:18.868
Well, let's just say my dad calls me "Roo"

50:18.910 --> 50:19.910
because I got bounce.

50:19.952 --> 50:20.826
Really?

50:20.867 --> 50:21.867
'Cause I play with some buddies,

50:21.909 --> 50:23.074
and I'm a bit of a ringer myself.

50:23.075 --> 50:25.533
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

50:26.865 --> 50:27.615
Hello!

50:27.657 --> 50:29.864
Oh, Mel, honey! Hi, sweetie!

50:29.906 --> 50:30.906
Oh, and...?

50:30.907 --> 50:32.614
Hi. Damon Hadley.

50:32.656 --> 50:34.404
Hi, Damon. Nice to meet you.

50:34.405 --> 50:35.405
Anna.

50:35.406 --> 50:36.445
Mel didn't tell me she was bringing a date.

50:36.487 --> 50:39.236
Oh, Damon's not my date. He's a client.

50:39.237 --> 50:40.569
Oh.

50:40.611 --> 50:41.735
I almost burned down my kitchen

50:41.777 --> 50:43.900
trying one of your daughter’s recipes, so...

50:43.901 --> 50:45.400
Gord, this is Damon, Mel's...

50:45.401 --> 50:46.609
Client, Dad.

50:46.651 --> 50:49.233
I figured the least I could
do is invite him over to dinner

50:49.274 --> 50:51.564
after one of my recipes failed.

50:51.565 --> 50:52.524
Nice to meet you.

50:52.565 --> 50:54.064
Pleasure to meet you, sir,

50:54.065 --> 50:55.939
and your daughter's recipes, they're great.

50:55.980 --> 50:56.897
I'm the problem.

50:56.898 --> 50:57.980
I never really learned how to cook.

50:58.022 --> 50:59.063
You know,

50:59.105 --> 51:00.895
I usually help my mom make the tacos,

51:00.896 --> 51:02.562
but if you wanted to...

51:02.603 --> 51:03.853
I wouldn't want to impose.

51:03.895 --> 51:05.353
No, no, not at all.

51:05.395 --> 51:07.143
Come on in. We'll get you set up.

51:10.768 --> 51:12.475
All right, now, a pinch of cumin.

51:12.517 --> 51:14.016
Oh, okay.

51:14.933 --> 51:16.432
Taste it. Always taste.

51:17.723 --> 51:18.640
What do you think?

51:18.682 --> 51:20.181
Oh... I always like a lot of spice.

51:20.223 --> 51:21.764
Perfect, me too.Here.

51:21.806 --> 51:22.887
This one's for you.

51:22.888 --> 51:24.596
All right!

51:24.638 --> 51:25.887
And then the key

51:25.929 --> 51:27.220
is to julienne the carrots like this.

51:27.221 --> 51:28.552
You throw those in with the cabbage,

51:28.553 --> 51:30.136
toss it...

51:31.386 --> 51:32.843
and then you make your taco...

51:32.885 --> 51:33.885
Uh-huh.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.467
Like that...

51:36.384 --> 51:37.175
Perfect.

51:37.217 --> 51:38.882
All right! There we go.

51:38.883 --> 51:41.132
Yes! Okay. If you can grab the tacos...

51:41.174 --> 51:42.049
Yes.

51:42.050 --> 51:43.923
I will get the hot sauce.

51:43.964 --> 51:46.214
Dinner's served!

51:51.796 --> 51:53.253
Damon, these are so delicious.

51:53.295 --> 51:54.211
Thank you.

51:54.252 --> 51:56.044
He's a quick learner, too, which is good.

51:56.086 --> 51:57.002
Who doesn't love a man

51:57.044 --> 51:58.293
who knows his way around a kitchen?

51:58.335 --> 52:01.542
Or a gal who knows her way around
the basketball court.

52:01.584 --> 52:02.625
Isn't that right, Roo?

52:02.667 --> 52:03.916
Oh, yeah, Roo.

52:03.957 --> 52:05.208
Mel told me about that.

52:05.249 --> 52:07.499
She got that from her mad
skills on the court?

52:07.540 --> 52:08.456
Uh, you know what?

52:08.498 --> 52:09.706
I'm just going to clear away some dishes.

52:09.748 --> 52:10.871
Well, actually,

52:10.872 --> 52:12.204
she got it

52:12.205 --> 52:13.288
from her bounce at the altar.

52:13.330 --> 52:15.038
I mean, just like a kangaroo,

52:15.079 --> 52:16.702
this one would bounce out of there

52:16.703 --> 52:18.827
before anyone had a chance to say, "I do".

52:20.494 --> 52:21.535
Gordon!

52:22.618 --> 52:25.033
Um, well, I'm sure once Mel
meets the right person,

52:25.034 --> 52:26.117
she won't bounce anymore.

52:26.159 --> 52:28.450
You're absolutely right, Damon.

52:28.492 --> 52:29.824
What about you?

52:29.866 --> 52:31.407
Anyone special in your life?

52:31.449 --> 52:32.948
No, still... still searching.

52:32.989 --> 52:34.073
Really?

52:34.114 --> 52:36.614
Uh, hey, Mom, what's all this stuff?

52:36.656 --> 52:39.071
Oh, I'm putting together a video collage

52:39.112 --> 52:40.695
for our anniversary party.

52:40.737 --> 52:41.653
30 years.

52:41.695 --> 52:43.611
I heard. That's incredible.

52:43.653 --> 52:45.319
I'm a lucky man.

52:45.361 --> 52:46.818
Why are you putting these in there?

52:47.735 --> 52:50.525
To show our joy over the last 30 years,

52:50.567 --> 52:52.359
which, of course, includes
you and your sister.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.524
By the way,

52:53.566 --> 52:54.899
I hope her date's going well.

52:54.940 --> 52:57.106
Oh, yeah, I forgot to check my phone!

52:58.814 --> 53:00.064
And here’s our little go-getter.

53:01.396 --> 53:03.979
Melanie. Cute Girl Scout, huh?

53:04.021 --> 53:05.021
Yeah.

53:05.022 --> 53:07.852
Oh, so cute.

53:07.853 --> 53:10.727
Aw...

53:10.769 --> 53:12.393
Yeah.

53:12.435 --> 53:13.976
Isn't she beautiful?

53:15.434 --> 53:17.350
Yeah, she is.

53:22.431 --> 53:24.097
Uh, well, no "help me" text from Jules,

53:24.139 --> 53:26.347
so I guess her date’s going pretty well.

53:26.388 --> 53:27.721
Think both of our daughters

53:27.763 --> 53:28.971
are having a successful night.

53:29.845 --> 53:31.887
Hey, Dad, how about some pick up?

53:31.928 --> 53:33.635
You bet. Damon?

53:33.677 --> 53:35.052
I'm in.

53:35.093 --> 53:38.800
Yeah, let's go.B-Ball.

53:40.176 --> 53:41.258
Yeah!

53:45.882 --> 53:47.756
Oh, nice!

53:48.672 --> 53:49.714
Oh, oh, oh!

53:59.002 --> 54:01.877
Cold drinks and cookies when you're ready.

54:01.917 --> 54:03.293
Oh... hi.

54:03.335 --> 54:04.709
Mom, why did you invite Rob over

54:04.751 --> 54:07.332
when you know it’s taco night?

54:07.333 --> 54:08.333
Well, he's always liked

54:08.374 --> 54:10.041
coming over in the past before,

54:10.082 --> 54:11.457
so I just thought...

54:11.498 --> 54:12.373
You thought what?

54:12.414 --> 54:14.039
That maybe we’d get back together?

54:14.080 --> 54:15.747
Damon, nice to see you again.

54:15.788 --> 54:17.329
You're hardly broken up.

54:17.330 --> 54:20.370
I mean, you still have his ring.

54:20.412 --> 54:21.369
I was really surprised

54:21.411 --> 54:22.493
when you brought a date tonight.

54:22.494 --> 54:24.244
Mom, Damon is not my date,

54:24.286 --> 54:25.660
and I am giving the ring back to Rob, okay?

54:25.702 --> 54:27.409
So whatever it is you’re doing,

54:27.451 --> 54:28.326
you need to stop.

54:28.327 --> 54:30.325
Because of Damon? He is lovely.

54:30.366 --> 54:32.325
He's still searching...

54:32.366 --> 54:34.990
Please, just stop, okay? Stop.

54:35.032 --> 54:36.240
Hey, how about a game of 21?

54:36.282 --> 54:37.281
Uh, you know what?

54:37.323 --> 54:38.654
Dad, I don't think

54:38.655 --> 54:40.321
Rob came over to play basketball.

54:40.322 --> 54:41.904
-Right, Rob?-I'll team up with you, Mel...

54:41.946 --> 54:45.737
unless Damon thinks that would
make the teams uneven.

54:46.944 --> 54:48.736
We got this. Right, Gord?

54:48.777 --> 54:50.444
You bet.

54:50.485 --> 54:51.901
We'll take it on.

54:51.943 --> 54:54.316
Gotcha, Dad.

Nice shot.

55:32.470 --> 55:33.845
Okay, that's a tie.

55:33.886 --> 55:35.053
All right, good game.

56:06.585 --> 56:09.292
Awarded to me for landing six
clients in a month.

56:11.666 --> 56:14.165
This is not good.

56:28.577 --> 56:30.076
Thanks for the game, Mr. Banning.

56:30.118 --> 56:31.575
Oh, and Mrs. Banning?

56:32.534 --> 56:34.533
I'll be by at, let's say, mm...

56:34.574 --> 56:36.116
noon to finish off that landscaping.

56:38.740 --> 56:40.281
Good one, Mom.

56:40.282 --> 56:43.363
Sorry.

56:43.405 --> 56:45.113
Let's go inside, honey.

56:50.944 --> 56:52.777
I'm sorry about all that.

56:52.819 --> 56:55.901
No, you have nothing to be sorry for.

56:56.942 --> 56:58.692
It's me.

56:58.733 --> 57:02.439
I never have been able to
walk away from a bet...

57:02.440 --> 57:03.815
even when I should.

57:03.856 --> 57:06.314
Yeah, well...

57:06.356 --> 57:08.604
my mom, she pushes sometimes,

57:08.605 --> 57:12.020
and I don't... I don't want any
more pressure, you know?

57:12.062 --> 57:15.102
I just want it to feel right, for me,

57:15.103 --> 57:16.186
and not just because

57:16.227 --> 57:18.518
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

57:18.559 --> 57:19.643
Wait, are you saying

57:19.685 --> 57:21.434
you haven't completely
given upon everything?

57:22.475 --> 57:24.058
Good night, Damon.

57:26.474 --> 57:28.723
Good night, Melanie.

57:50.632 --> 57:52.881
Mm, look what just came in.

57:52.923 --> 57:54.048
Bran Buddy samples.

57:54.090 --> 57:56.047
The bet's off.

57:56.089 --> 57:57.297
What, the olive angle didn’t work?

57:57.338 --> 57:58.296
No, it's just...

57:58.338 --> 57:59.920
she's already been engaged three times,

57:59.921 --> 58:01.128
and now I come along and start messing

58:01.170 --> 58:02.419
with any chance she might ever have

58:02.420 --> 58:04.044
of doing this again.

58:07.252 --> 58:08.377
I'm confused.

58:08.418 --> 58:10.626
I thought she wasn't
ever going to do this again.

58:10.668 --> 58:13.500
Yeah, well, I don't
think she’s totally given up.

58:13.542 --> 58:14.624
Because of you?

58:15.749 --> 58:16.831
I don't know...

58:16.873 --> 58:18.498
but I can't say I don't hope so.

58:18.539 --> 58:19.872
Whoa, are you telling me

58:19.914 --> 58:21.080
you actually want to marry this girl?

58:21.081 --> 58:24.245
I'm telling you the bet's off.

58:24.246 --> 58:25.704
Really?

58:25.745 --> 58:27.078
Well, if it is,

58:27.079 --> 58:28.244
you're going to be chewing on these

58:28.245 --> 58:29.328
instead of hanging outwith the Juicy crew,

58:29.370 --> 58:30.369
who, by the way,

58:30.410 --> 58:32.618
are live streaming their private jet party

58:32.660 --> 58:34.660
for their online promo.

58:34.700 --> 58:36.283
I'm good.

58:36.325 --> 58:37.991
Really, I don't mind losing.

58:39.699 --> 58:40.865
I'm not going to ask her to marry me

58:40.907 --> 58:43.697
over a bet I never should have placed.

58:43.739 --> 58:46.072
Works for me.

58:46.113 --> 58:47.404
Damon!

58:49.238 --> 58:50.363
For your morning coffee.

58:54.985 --> 58:56.069
Okay, ladies!

58:56.110 --> 58:58.235
Today, we are going to
learn some dance moves

58:58.276 --> 59:00.776
in preparation for your dance badges.

59:03.233 --> 59:06.482
Okay, everybody, spread
out, arms-length apart.

59:06.524 --> 59:08.356
All right, let's start with the twist!

59:08.397 --> 59:10.396
Yeah!

59:10.397 --> 59:13.938
♪ ♪

59:13.979 --> 59:15.145
It's okay. I'll handle it.

59:15.187 --> 59:16.561
Okay.

59:16.603 --> 59:18.144
Good job! Good job.

59:18.186 --> 59:21.059
Hey, Avery?

59:21.060 --> 59:23.226
Do you think you might want
to dance with me?

59:23.227 --> 59:24.559
I'm not very good,

59:24.601 --> 59:26.142
but maybe you could show me a few moves?

59:26.184 --> 59:27.890
-Okay.-Okay?

59:27.891 --> 59:29.432
Come on.

59:29.474 --> 59:31.640
♪ ♪

59:31.681 --> 59:33.889
I like this.

59:33.931 --> 59:34.847
Good job!

59:34.889 --> 59:37.055
Roll it down.

59:37.096 --> 59:38.763
And up. Down low.

59:38.804 --> 59:41.386
You have got some seriously good moves.

59:41.428 --> 59:42.719
Ready to show these girls what you got?

59:42.761 --> 59:44.968
-Yes!-Yes.

59:49.051 --> 59:50.300
All right, ladies? Ladies!

59:50.342 --> 59:52.133
If I could just have your
attention for one minute.

59:53.841 --> 59:55.548
Okay, girls. Come on.

59:56.548 --> 59:57.548
Hit it!

59:57.590 --> 59:59.172
♪ ♪

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:32.745
Take it away, Avery!

01:00:38.867 --> 01:00:39.950
Keep going, Avery!

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.193
Aw...

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:04.357
That girl doesn't know how amazing she is.

01:01:04.358 --> 01:01:05.774
The other girls could
learn a thing or two...

01:01:14.646 --> 01:01:17.146
I'm so sorry. I...

01:01:32.183 --> 01:01:33.390
Mel?

01:01:34.307 --> 01:01:35.223
Darren, hi!

01:01:35.265 --> 01:01:37.556
Thought that was you.

01:01:37.598 --> 01:01:38.847
How've you been?

01:01:39.638 --> 01:01:41.845
Uh, I... I've been great. How about you?

01:01:41.846 --> 01:01:45.303
I'm going to ask my girlfriend,
Diana, to marry me.

01:01:46.344 --> 01:01:48.178
Hopefully, she'll say yes and
not run out of the church.

01:01:48.219 --> 01:01:49.635
I'm sure she won't.

01:01:49.677 --> 01:01:51.676
Uh, not... she won't run out of the church.

01:01:51.718 --> 01:01:52.758
Right.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.009
Yeah.

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.007
It was nice to see you, Mel.

01:01:56.008 --> 01:01:57.091
You too.

01:01:58.007 --> 01:01:59.007
Wish me luck.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.590
Good luck!

01:02:08.296 --> 01:02:09.420
I just got off the phone

01:02:09.462 --> 01:02:11.544
with the coordinator for
the KLP morning show.

01:02:11.586 --> 01:02:12.502
Remember I sent them

01:02:12.503 --> 01:02:14.210
the press kit Damon put together?

01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:16.251
They want us to be on their show.

01:02:16.293 --> 01:02:17.376
Isn't that great?

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:20.292
I told you hiring Damon was a good idea.

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:22.332
Oh, it was a good idea, all right.

01:02:22.374 --> 01:02:24.248
Well, I'm glad you finally agree.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:25.498
So I was thinking we should do something

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.831
to show our appreciation,

01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.663
like a free class, or...

01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:30.328
A kiss?

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:31.246
Excuse me?

01:02:31.288 --> 01:02:33.495
I kissed him, Jules.

01:02:34.454 --> 01:02:35.327
What?

01:02:35.327 --> 01:02:36.327
When?

01:02:36.328 --> 01:02:37.493
At Scouts.

01:02:37.494 --> 01:02:39.951
Okay, first of all, I would
have never guessed that,

01:02:39.993 --> 01:02:41.285
and secondly, why?

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.449
Because I love him.

01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:45.533
Damon's the one.

01:02:45.575 --> 01:02:47.991
As in, "The One" you
wouldn't leave at the altar?

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:49.156
Yup. That's The One.

01:02:49.157 --> 01:02:50.865
That is great.

01:02:50.906 --> 01:02:51.822
No, it's not.

01:02:51.822 --> 01:02:52.780
It's not?

01:02:52.822 --> 01:02:53.989
No. I mean,

01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:56.154
I finally find a guy I could
do happily ever after with,

01:02:56.155 --> 01:02:57.237
and he's not the marrying kind.

01:02:57.279 --> 01:02:58.528
Are you sure?

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:01.278
Jules, I know his type.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.235
He says he's searching,
but he's damaged goods,

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:05.526
and he would bounce faster than I would.

01:03:05.568 --> 01:03:06.942
Did he kiss you back?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.775
Yeah, I think so.

01:03:08.817 --> 01:03:09.691
See?

01:03:09.732 --> 01:03:12.023
Then you won't know unless you ask him.

01:03:12.065 --> 01:03:14.606
You want me to ask him to marry me?

01:03:15.981 --> 01:03:19.312
You're the one who's
always been put on the spot.

01:03:19.313 --> 01:03:21.937
Maybe it's time to put the
shoe on the other foot?

01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:26.519
So she kissed you,

01:03:26.561 --> 01:03:27.768
and now she won't return your calls?

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:28.810
Sounds to me like you were right,

01:03:28.852 --> 01:03:29.892
and she's the one with the problem.

01:03:29.934 --> 01:03:31.059
I don't know.

01:03:31.101 --> 01:03:33.475
She's amazing in every other way...

01:03:34.308 --> 01:03:35.432
and that kiss was...

01:03:36.391 --> 01:03:37.307
Was what?

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:39.597
You know, that kind of kiss

01:03:39.639 --> 01:03:41.014
where the music just stops and...

01:03:41.056 --> 01:03:43.013
You watching Rom-coms in your PJs,

01:03:43.055 --> 01:03:44.179
eating ice cream?

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.346
Of course not.

01:03:55.717 --> 01:03:56.966
Who's that?

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:58.800
Fiancé number three.

01:03:59.966 --> 01:04:01.424
That's why you should bail,

01:04:01.465 --> 01:04:03.090
before you become casualty number four.

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:04.798
Come on, I’ll buy you a taco.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.129
Great job, Heather.

01:04:12.962 --> 01:04:15.669
Mia, that is some seriously
beautiful bead work.

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.669
You definitely deserve this.

01:04:20.209 --> 01:04:21.291
Avery,

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:25.166
you have light in your
feet and in your heart.

01:04:25.207 --> 01:04:26.416
Don't ever forget that.

01:04:29.123 --> 01:04:31.081
Mm? Oh, I have it right here.

01:04:32.996 --> 01:04:34.162
Me?

01:04:37.911 --> 01:04:39.411
For you.

01:04:39.452 --> 01:04:40.951
What is this?

01:04:40.952 --> 01:04:42.244
The Leadership badge you wanted.

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:45.700
Thank you.

01:04:48.658 --> 01:04:50.657
Okay, it's time to say goodbye,

01:04:50.698 --> 01:04:52.407
so let's close our eyes and make a wish.

01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:05.652
Okay!

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:08.318
Have a great night, everyone,

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.609
and again, good job today!

01:05:09.651 --> 01:05:10.775
Bye, guys!

01:05:13.066 --> 01:05:14.066
-Bye!-Bye!

01:05:14.108 --> 01:05:15.066
Bye!

01:05:15.108 --> 01:05:16.524
Bye, Avery!

01:05:19.855 --> 01:05:21.147
That was really nice of you.

01:05:21.189 --> 01:05:25.062
Well, you've been a really
great volunteer, so...

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.269
Mel, I was...

01:05:28.311 --> 01:05:29.769
uh...

01:05:29.811 --> 01:05:31.227
I was wondering about the other day.

01:05:32.476 --> 01:05:34.766
Right, of course.

01:05:34.767 --> 01:05:36.766
Again, I am so sorry about that.

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:37.974
Oh, no, it's...

01:05:39.849 --> 01:05:41.264
it's okay.

01:05:41.265 --> 01:05:42.430
You've got a lot going on,

01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:44.972
and...

01:05:45.847 --> 01:05:46.971
you don't have to worry

01:05:47.013 --> 01:05:47.971
because I don't want to
add to that confusion.

01:05:49.429 --> 01:05:50.929
I promise, I'll leave you alone.

01:05:53.011 --> 01:05:54.968
Marry me!

01:05:56.635 --> 01:05:57.510
Excuse me?

01:05:57.551 --> 01:06:00.592
I know that sounds crazy,

01:06:00.634 --> 01:06:02.257
especially after everything I said,

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:04.715
but...

01:06:04.757 --> 01:06:06.756
this is different.

01:06:06.757 --> 01:06:07.714
I know it is,

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:09.547
and I wanted to be sure next time,

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:11.546
so...

01:06:11.588 --> 01:06:13.962
will you marry me?

01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:16.836
Uh...

01:06:19.169 --> 01:06:21.918
Oh, my gosh, I've seen that face before.

01:06:22.918 --> 01:06:23.834
It's mine.

01:06:23.876 --> 01:06:26.125
It's my face.

01:06:26.167 --> 01:06:27.374
So I get it,

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:30.081
and please, don't feel
pressured into saying yes,

01:06:30.082 --> 01:06:33.580
because there's no one around,

01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:34.997
so we can just walk away and
pretend this never happened.

01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:36.580
Mel, wait. Uh, wait.

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.162
I'm just speechless

01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:43.494
because I can't believe you
knew what my wish was.

01:06:45.327 --> 01:06:47.659
You.

01:06:49.533 --> 01:06:50.867
I wished for you.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.157
Does that mean...?

01:06:54.199 --> 01:06:55.531
Yes.

01:06:55.573 --> 01:06:56.947
Yes?

01:06:56.989 --> 01:06:58.489
Yes, I will marry you.

01:07:00.197 --> 01:07:01.237
I mean, are you sure?

01:07:01.238 --> 01:07:02.154
Because if you need more time, I will...

01:07:08.194 --> 01:07:09.527
Yes.

01:07:19.982 --> 01:07:21.356
You proposed?

01:07:21.398 --> 01:07:22.897
I did.

01:07:22.898 --> 01:07:24.481
Isn't it great?

01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:26.812
Hey, let's give cred for where it's due.

01:07:26.854 --> 01:07:28.520
It was my idea.

01:07:28.562 --> 01:07:30.353
Of course it was.

01:07:30.395 --> 01:07:32.519
Are you sure about this, Melanie?

01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:36.059
I mean, it just seems all really impulsive.

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.558
That's the thing.

01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:39.434
I don't have to wait for him to grow on me

01:07:39.475 --> 01:07:40.725
because I know that I love him,

01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:41.766
and I promise you,

01:07:41.807 --> 01:07:42.890
I would not put you through this again

01:07:42.891 --> 01:07:44.556
if I wasn't sure.

01:07:44.557 --> 01:07:48.055
Well, congratulations, Roo.

01:07:48.056 --> 01:07:49.056
So what do you think, Mom?

01:07:49.057 --> 01:07:50.387
Will you help me plan the wedding?

01:07:50.388 --> 01:07:52.721
Because I want everything to
be absolutely perfect.

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:55.137
Really?

01:07:55.178 --> 01:07:57.261
In the past, you haven't
wanted to make a big deal.

01:07:57.303 --> 01:08:00.052
I know, but this is different.

01:08:00.093 --> 01:08:02.759
He's the one. He really is The One.

01:08:04.425 --> 01:08:06.175
You hear this, Gord?

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:07.215
We're planning a wedding!

01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:10.547
Does that mean we can stop planning
the anniversary party?

01:08:10.548 --> 01:08:12.298
Dad!

01:08:14.713 --> 01:08:15.963
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:08:18.879 --> 01:08:20.627
Good game, man.

01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:21.669
Whoo!

01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:22.711
I don't believe it.

01:08:22.712 --> 01:08:24.835
Well, believe it, 'cause it's happening.

01:08:24.877 --> 01:08:26.876
Wow. Talk about a slam dunk.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.541
You sure about this wedding, buddy?

01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:32.082
I mean, because you bailed on the bet,

01:08:32.124 --> 01:08:34.038
you don't have to go through with it.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:34.956
I'm sure,

01:08:34.997 --> 01:08:37.038
and this has nothing to do with the bet.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.830
I wanted to say yes.

01:08:38.872 --> 01:08:41.787
Yeah, but you've still got to say "I do."

01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:44.287
Trust me, it's pretty scary up there.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.118
I sweated right through my blazer.

01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:48.077
Yeah, well, it doesn't phase me.

01:08:48.118 --> 01:08:49.201
You know why?

01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:51.992
Because I love her...

01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:53.908
in... you know, in that way.

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:55.283
What way?

01:08:55.325 --> 01:08:56.283
In that, uh...

01:08:56.323 --> 01:08:58.365
"I feel so lucky to have met her,

01:08:58.407 --> 01:08:59.823
and I can't wait to
see what tomorrow brings,"

01:08:59.865 --> 01:09:00.823
kind of way.

01:09:03.113 --> 01:09:04.694
I'm sorry. It's just...

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:06.154
I mean, who would have
thought by you making a bet

01:09:06.194 --> 01:09:07.612
to get her to say yes,

01:09:07.653 --> 01:09:09.361
you'd end up being the one proposed to...

01:09:09.403 --> 01:09:11.027
but it doesn't change the
fact that you bailed,

01:09:11.028 --> 01:09:12.069
right?

01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:13.609
Don't worry,

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:16.109
I'll make magic with that
Bran Buddies account.

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:18.858
My man.

01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:21.441
Juicy Soda’s my account.

01:09:24.481 --> 01:09:25.688
Wow.

01:09:25.689 --> 01:09:28.354
How long have you been
hiding your Choco Pops addiction?

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:29.645
They're for Damon.

01:09:29.688 --> 01:09:30.688
He and his mom

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:31.937
used to eat them
for breakfast every morning,

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:32.979
so I thought it’d be nice

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.810
to add them to his grocery list.

01:09:34.853 --> 01:09:36.560
What are you going to do with your dresses?

01:09:36.602 --> 01:09:38.060
You're not going to wear
one of those, are you?

01:09:38.102 --> 01:09:39.517
No, of course not.

01:09:39.518 --> 01:09:40.767
I'm going to find the
perfect dress this time,

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:43.350
and these, I'm going to give to charity,

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.015
except, I don't know...

01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:48.473
maybe I'll keep this.

01:09:48.515 --> 01:09:50.514
Have you told Rob?

01:09:51.846 --> 01:09:52.846
I'm going to stop over and see him

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:54.013
on my way to Damon.

01:09:59.469 --> 01:10:00.927
Rob!

01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:01.844
Mel.

01:10:01.885 --> 01:10:04.884
I was just on my way to see you.

01:10:06.842 --> 01:10:08.050
Is that the one you plan on wearing

01:10:08.092 --> 01:10:09.008
when you marry Damon?

01:10:09.049 --> 01:10:10.757
What? No, of course not...

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.756
I'm sorry, how did you...?

01:10:13.798 --> 01:10:14.798
I heard, Mel.

01:10:15.714 --> 01:10:16.880
Rob, I'm so sorry.

01:10:16.922 --> 01:10:18.297
I was just about to go tell you.

01:10:18.338 --> 01:10:19.629
It was a bet, Mel.

01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:20.671
What?

01:10:20.672 --> 01:10:22.669
He bet on you,

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.961
but instead of this watch,

01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:25.668
the wager was some account at work.

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:29.001
You say "yes" to his proposal, and he wins.

01:10:29.002 --> 01:10:31.292
Rob, if this is your way of
trying to get me back

01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:32.458
and break it off with Damon,

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.500
then you're not doing a...

01:10:33.501 --> 01:10:34.832
I know you asked him, Mel,

01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:36.416
because at the basketball court,

01:10:36.457 --> 01:10:37.497
they were all talking

01:10:37.498 --> 01:10:39.123
about what a slam dunk your proposal was.

01:10:40.497 --> 01:10:43.371
Okay, it's time for you to go now, Rob.

01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:47.911
He rolled the dice on you, Mel,

01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:49.911
and he won.

01:10:50.744 --> 01:10:51.993
Mel.

01:10:51.994 --> 01:10:53.451
Mel!

01:10:56.742 --> 01:10:57.783
Hey!

01:10:57.825 --> 01:10:58.992
Does the dress shop know you
left with that on?

01:10:59.032 --> 01:11:02.322
Ooh, were you thinking a
big wedding or small?

01:11:02.323 --> 01:11:03.739
'Cause my mom's already calling relatives.

01:11:04.781 --> 01:11:06.989
That depends. What did you bet on?

01:11:09.238 --> 01:11:10.986
Or did the wedding not even matter,

01:11:10.987 --> 01:11:12.736
and it was just about getting me to say yes?

01:11:12.778 --> 01:11:14.485
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:11:14.486 --> 01:11:16.152
I know about the bet, Damon.

01:11:18.818 --> 01:11:20.942
Mel, it wasn't like that.

01:11:20.984 --> 01:11:22.566
Oh, I know...

01:11:22.608 --> 01:11:24.982
because I'm the one that proposed to you.

01:11:24.983 --> 01:11:26.023
So what?

01:11:26.065 --> 01:11:27.398
Did that just raise the stakes or something?

01:11:27.439 --> 01:11:28.523
No, I called it off.

01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:30.273
I called the bet off before you asked.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:32.980
Mel, I was falling in love with you.

01:11:33.021 --> 01:11:34.729
I didn't want it to be about a bet.

01:11:36.561 --> 01:11:38.436
What's the first law in the Scouts, Damon?

01:11:40.061 --> 01:11:41.601
A Scout is trustworthy.

01:11:59.221 --> 01:12:00.512
Wow...

01:12:00.553 --> 01:12:02.886
This is going to be quite a party.

01:12:02.928 --> 01:12:05.302
Yes, it is.

01:12:06.802 --> 01:12:09.009
You know, I joke,

01:12:09.051 --> 01:12:11.384
but I'd have a party for a hundred people

01:12:11.425 --> 01:12:12.675
if it'd make your mother happy,

01:12:12.716 --> 01:12:15.257
because when I saw her working that grill

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:16.632
at the street fair,

01:12:16.674 --> 01:12:20.005
I knew she had to be my wife.

01:12:20.047 --> 01:12:23.255
The only problem was, so did my buddy.

01:12:23.296 --> 01:12:24.462
Frank Hendersen...

01:12:24.504 --> 01:12:27.670
yeah, he was something.

01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:28.961
Handsome, a doctor...

01:12:29.002 --> 01:12:31.959
So I asked him. I said,
"Frank, give me a chance."

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.209
He said, "Sure, go for it...

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:39.666
"but if you lose,

01:12:39.707 --> 01:12:41.165
it's anyone's game."

01:12:41.207 --> 01:12:42.373
So, needless to say,

01:12:42.414 --> 01:12:44.956
I spent the next month trying to outdo Frank

01:12:44.997 --> 01:12:46.620
for your mother's attention.

01:12:46.621 --> 01:12:47.579
Did mom know?

01:12:47.621 --> 01:12:49.619
You know, I'm not sure...

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.452
but the point is,

01:12:51.453 --> 01:12:54.744
the circumstances in which you meet someone,

01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:56.618
or fall in love...

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.076
it really doesn't change how
you feel about them,

01:12:59.117 --> 01:13:02.158
because when you know it’s right,

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.574
it's right,

01:13:03.616 --> 01:13:04.907
and when it's not...

01:13:04.949 --> 01:13:06.657
we move on.

01:13:06.698 --> 01:13:08.948
Thanks, Dad.

01:13:12.112 --> 01:13:13.029
I love you.

01:13:13.071 --> 01:13:14.654
I love you, too.

01:13:31.606 --> 01:13:34.397
Are you sure about this?

01:13:34.438 --> 01:13:37.437
Because there’s no going back.

01:13:40.686 --> 01:13:42.810
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:13:46.352 --> 01:13:48.017
Okay. Bye.

01:13:48.059 --> 01:13:49.100
Bye.

01:14:00.096 --> 01:14:01.929
Hey, Rob.

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:04.095
Hey.

01:14:04.137 --> 01:14:05.094
You all right?

01:14:05.095 --> 01:14:07.552
Yeah, I will be.

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:11.425
Look, Mel, I didn't
enjoy having to tell you.

01:14:11.426 --> 01:14:13.383
I just figured you should know...

01:14:13.425 --> 01:14:14.759
whether it meant you came back to me or not.

01:14:16.424 --> 01:14:17.674
Have you?

01:14:17.716 --> 01:14:19.924
No, Rob, I haven't.

01:14:20.881 --> 01:14:22.422
You deserve somebody
who’s going to love you back

01:14:22.464 --> 01:14:25.130
just as much as you love them.

01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:41.207
Hey, Mel?

01:14:42.749 --> 01:14:45.332
Despite the bet...

01:14:45.373 --> 01:14:46.914
it's really not that unbelievable

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.830
to think Damon fell in love with you.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:02.825
What do we think about when
we think about home?

01:15:02.867 --> 01:15:04.907
Warmth.

01:15:04.908 --> 01:15:06.824
Family.

01:15:06.866 --> 01:15:07.990
Comfort.

01:15:08.032 --> 01:15:11.239
That's what Bran Buddies are.

01:15:11.281 --> 01:15:14.654
They are homegrown goodness.

01:15:14.696 --> 01:15:18.196
That's your brand... a homegrown company

01:15:18.237 --> 01:15:21.028
made with homegrown love.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.192
Out of everyone on my team,
I knew it would be you

01:15:25.234 --> 01:15:28.108
to brand those tasteless pieces
of cardboard,

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:30.398
and to show my appreciation,

01:15:30.399 --> 01:15:32.398
I am putting you on the Juicy team...

01:15:32.399 --> 01:15:34.397
but before you say thank you,

01:15:34.398 --> 01:15:36.106
I hear they’re having a sponsored luau,

01:15:36.148 --> 01:15:37.314
and you know what that means.

01:15:38.897 --> 01:15:40.521
Hula girls, Damon.

01:15:40.563 --> 01:15:41.604
Great. Thanks.

01:15:41.645 --> 01:15:42.728
Don't mention it.

01:15:42.729 --> 01:15:45.352
How about you and I go grab a taco,

01:15:45.394 --> 01:15:46.603
shoot some hoop?

01:15:46.644 --> 01:15:48.476
You know, I think I'm
just going to head home.

01:15:48.518 --> 01:15:50.393
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:16:06.304 --> 01:16:07.553
Here, let me help you with that.

01:16:07.554 --> 01:16:10.261
Damon! Thank you.

01:16:10.303 --> 01:16:12.094
That's a lot of cookies.

01:16:12.135 --> 01:16:14.217
Yeah, shopping for the anniversary party.

01:16:14.218 --> 01:16:15.884
Right.

01:16:15.925 --> 01:16:17.049
30 years.

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.841
Mm-hmm.

01:16:18.883 --> 01:16:20.591
How's Melanie?

01:16:20.632 --> 01:16:22.007
Miserable.

01:16:24.214 --> 01:16:26.881
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Banning.

01:16:26.922 --> 01:16:29.880
I should never have placed that bet.

01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:31.296
Once I got to know Mel,

01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:33.253
I was...

01:16:33.295 --> 01:16:35.169
I was embarrassed.

01:16:35.211 --> 01:16:36.210
It was selfish.

01:16:36.252 --> 01:16:37.626
Maybe.

01:16:38.793 --> 01:16:39.959
Let me ask you this.

01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:42.750
Without placing it, would
you have met Melanie?

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:45.666
No, probably not.

01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:47.498
Then it was meant to be.

01:16:48.873 --> 01:16:50.371
That night you came over...

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:52.496
I know Melanie insisted it was not a date,

01:16:52.538 --> 01:16:54.288
but I know my daughter.

01:16:54.329 --> 01:16:55.413
Mel loves you...

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:59.535
so bet or no bet,

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:01.702
I can see that you love her.

01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:03.577
I do.

01:17:05.118 --> 01:17:06.492
I do love her.

01:17:07.992 --> 01:17:08.867
There's no way

01:17:08.908 --> 01:17:10.657
I could convince her of that now.

01:17:10.699 --> 01:17:11.699
Of course there is.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.447
Do the one thing she doubts the most.

01:17:17.697 --> 01:17:18.779
Marry her.

01:17:39.523 --> 01:17:42.729
Guests are arriving!

01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:43.896
I am getting excited.

01:17:43.938 --> 01:17:45.146
Me too.

01:17:45.187 --> 01:17:48.144
Wow, everything looks perfect.

01:17:48.186 --> 01:17:49.351
I think we're ready.

01:17:49.352 --> 01:17:52.476
Oh, I've got to go. My date is here.

01:17:52.518 --> 01:17:54.350
Oh, he must really like you

01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:56.141
to come to a family event like this.

01:17:56.183 --> 01:17:57.058
You think so?

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.141
Jules, all weddings freak men out,

01:17:59.182 --> 01:18:00.391
even wedding anniversaries,

01:18:00.432 --> 01:18:01.557
so yeah, he likes you.

01:18:01.598 --> 01:18:03.181
Yes!

01:18:04.556 --> 01:18:06.179
Mom, you look amazing!

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.346
Thank you! So do you.

01:18:07.388 --> 01:18:08.846
Thank you.

01:18:08.887 --> 01:18:10.178
Let's get this show started.

01:18:10.179 --> 01:18:11.262
Let's do it.

01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:16.677
Do you, Gordon Banning,

01:18:16.718 --> 01:18:19.217
give to Anna a new promise

01:18:19.259 --> 01:18:21.259
to continue loving her

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.966
with the same heart that has
loved her for 30 years,

01:18:24.007 --> 01:18:25.007
from now to eternity?

01:18:25.965 --> 01:18:27.048
I do.

01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:29.256
Do you, Anna Banning,

01:18:29.297 --> 01:18:31.130
give to Gordon a new promise

01:18:31.171 --> 01:18:32.296
to continue loving him

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:35.254
from the heart that has
loved him for 30 years,

01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:37.628
from now to eternity?

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:38.545
I do.

01:18:38.585 --> 01:18:40.752
Well then, one more time,

01:18:40.794 --> 01:18:42.626
let's seal it with a kiss.

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.042
Yay!

01:18:47.833 --> 01:18:50.331
-So beautiful!-Thanks, sweetie.

01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:51.540
Congratulations.

01:18:53.498 --> 01:18:54.996
Here, Mom.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:55.871
You get to throw it again.

01:18:55.913 --> 01:18:58.079
Actually, sweetheart,

01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.328
you might want to hold onto that.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:09.118
You invited him?

01:19:09.159 --> 01:19:11.117
I did.

01:19:18.322 --> 01:19:19.155
Mel...

01:19:19.197 --> 01:19:20.239
Mel, just give me a chance.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.238
A chance to what?

01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:23.695
Explain how you used me?

01:19:23.737 --> 01:19:24.654
No, not here.

01:19:24.655 --> 01:19:27.653
Not at my parents' wedding anniversary.

01:19:27.694 --> 01:19:29.111
Well, then how about at our wedding?

01:19:29.152 --> 01:19:30.027
What?

01:19:31.026 --> 01:19:32.692
I know making that bet was
a lousy thing to do,

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.650
but if I hadn't...

01:19:34.691 --> 01:19:36.067
I never would have met you,

01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:37.608
so...

01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:38.981
if you asked me if I'd do it again?

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:39.940
Yeah.

01:19:39.981 --> 01:19:41.981
Yeah, I would...

01:19:43.272 --> 01:19:44.480
because before I met you,

01:19:44.522 --> 01:19:47.896
I never could have seen
myself walking down that aisle.

01:19:47.938 --> 01:19:50.520
You made me believe in happily ever after.

01:19:52.894 --> 01:19:55.519
I love you, Mel.

01:19:57.142 --> 01:19:59.474
I just...

01:19:59.475 --> 01:20:02.099
I hope you still feel the same way.

01:20:04.349 --> 01:20:06.389
Melanie Banning...

01:20:09.347 --> 01:20:11.222
Will you marry me?

01:20:11.262 --> 01:20:12.970
Oh, my gosh.

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.345
Hi!

01:20:16.386 --> 01:20:18.885
You invited my Scouts?

01:20:18.927 --> 01:20:20.802
I figured what's a
wedding without flower girls?

01:20:26.424 --> 01:20:27.799
Um...

01:20:28.882 --> 01:20:30.090
Hey, honestly,

01:20:30.131 --> 01:20:31.964
it's not my intention to
make you feel any pressure,

01:20:32.006 --> 01:20:33.713
so if the answer is no...

01:20:33.755 --> 01:20:35.880
I understand.

01:20:35.921 --> 01:20:36.921
I just wanted to show you

01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:39.462
how committed I am to you,

01:20:39.504 --> 01:20:41.377
and that I would be honored

01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:43.211
to marry you right here...

01:20:43.252 --> 01:20:44.335
right now.

01:20:46.001 --> 01:20:47.084
I...

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:49.167
I get it. You're not feeling it.

01:20:49.209 --> 01:20:50.458
Yes.

01:20:54.373 --> 01:20:55.622
I'm sorry, did you say...?

01:20:55.623 --> 01:20:57.498
Yes!

01:20:57.539 --> 01:20:58.497
Yes?

01:20:58.538 --> 01:21:00.121
I said yes.

01:21:10.701 --> 01:21:11.784
Thank you.

01:21:17.865 --> 01:21:21.364
You got this, Mel?

01:21:21.406 --> 01:21:22.447
Yeah.

01:21:49.688 --> 01:21:52.270
Thanks, Avery.

01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:58.393
In the spirit of Gordon and
Anna's anniversary...

01:21:58.435 --> 01:21:59.726
do you, Damon Hadley,

01:21:59.768 --> 01:22:00.726
give to Melanie

01:22:00.768 --> 01:22:03.432
a promise to love her with all your heart

01:22:03.433 --> 01:22:04.766
from now to eternity?

01:22:04.767 --> 01:22:06.224
I do.

01:22:07.599 --> 01:22:09.182
And do you, Melanie Banning,

01:22:09.223 --> 01:22:10.598
give to Damon

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.056
a promise to love him with all your heart

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:14.763
from now to eternity?

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.303
I do.

01:22:19.344 --> 01:22:21.094
I pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.469
You may kiss the bride.

01:22:30.382 --> 01:22:31.757
Yay!

01:22:33.923 --> 01:22:35.465
We did it!

01:22:35.505 --> 01:22:37.422
Congratulations.

01:22:40.087 --> 01:22:42.795
Who wants cake? Who wants cake?

01:22:51.292 --> 01:22:53.000
So, we took the plunge.

01:22:53.042 --> 01:22:54.332
Head first.

01:22:56.498 --> 01:22:57.540
Are you sure?

01:22:57.582 --> 01:22:59.747
I am.

01:22:59.748 --> 01:23:00.873
Scout's honor.

01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:03.705
I love you, Melanie.

01:23:03.747 --> 01:23:06.370
I love you, Damon.

01:23:14.576 --> 01:23:15.409
Hit it!

01:23:17.408 --> 01:23:18.408
What?

01:23:18.450 --> 01:23:19.906
May I have this dance?

01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:21.365
What did you do?

01:23:22.073 --> 01:23:23.489
You didn't!

01:23:28.863 --> 01:23:30.612
Oh, my goodness!
