03:04.084 --> 03:05.662
Come on, you guys.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.264
Sky, where's
your little brother?

03:07.288 --> 03:08.832
He's here.
I'm right here.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.099
Come on.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.925
Wow, this place is so cool.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.404
Come on.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.072
Jamie, Jamie.
Turn on your flashlight.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.241
Wait.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.942
Oh, look.
We can do shadow puppets.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.109
I love shadow puppets.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.911
I think I can do a bunny.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.146
Can you make a dog?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.814
Wait.
Or a peacock.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.149
That's more a rectangle.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.284
True.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.918
That's like an eye underneath.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.887
That's cool. You can do a
trick you like that, too, maybe.

03:30.911 --> 03:31.988
I don't know.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.223
I know llama.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.824
It looks like its nose
is popping out of its face.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.393
What about snacks?
"Snacks"?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.527
But you just had dinner.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.995
I don't even know what I ate.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.597
Macrobiotic diet.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.498
Yeah.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.334
Please, will you get me
something to eat?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.369
Lane, you go.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.670
Okay, I'll go find something.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.562
One queen.
Bullshit.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.976
Raoul was arrested.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.245
Did you hear about that?

04:06.113 --> 04:08.492
He had half a joint on him.

04:08.516 --> 04:11.828
And they beat him within
an inch of his life.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.730
Just for having long hair.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.365
And half a joint.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.933
Fucked up, man.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.968
But that's the city for you.
It'll eat its young.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.070
Don't kid yourself
about the locals out here.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.474
Some of the old time families
out here have rifles.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.142
And I hear they're
willing to use 'em

04:26.166 --> 04:27.944
on any long hairs they
think might trespass.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.746
What's up, lady?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.515
Some of the other kids
are still hungry.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.183
You know, it's not healthy
to put food in your system this late.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.386
I know. It's not for me.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.054
What does it say?

04:38.078 --> 04:41.090
Tarot is just
really intuitive...

04:41.114 --> 04:42.759
Where did you learn that?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.428
You know, here and there.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.286
Like, every year or something.

04:46.854 --> 04:47.921
Yeah?

04:56.096 --> 04:57.398
I'd like that.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.069
Is that all it says?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.917
I'm learning, teaching myself.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.354
Oh, sorry. I hope we
didn't wake up Shayla.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.846
Oh, don't worry.
That kid sleeps through anything.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.825
One, two.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.362
Do you think you guys will
stay here at Big Mountain?

05:18.386 --> 05:21.264
I hope we can, but...

05:21.288 --> 05:24.434
my mom keeps on talking
about moving to Bolinas.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.336
I bet if we get into
a school here, we'll stay.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.104
We tried to go to
public school once,

05:28.128 --> 05:30.340
but Hallelujah wasn't into it.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.642
Hallelujah is your mom?
Yep.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.712
I used to go to such a fun
free school in Cazadero.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.406
I hope you guys don't go
to Bolinas.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.883
Me, too.

05:39.907 --> 05:40.974
Bullshit.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.077
Time for lights out.
Go to sleep, Berry.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.981
Can I sleep down there with you?

05:48.281 --> 05:49.550
Sure.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.925
I'm really glad
you guys came here.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.630
Me, too.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.957
Hey, Gina, wake up.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.669
Dad.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.971
Gina, come on.
We gotta go, okay?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.096
Come on.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.766
Get your shoes on.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.169
Here we go.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.746
There we go.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.159
Let's go.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.594
You got your blanket?

06:57.618 --> 06:59.429
Okay. Here we go.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.064
Wait. My friend.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.299
It's okay.
But I don't wanna go.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.434
Where are we going?

07:04.458 --> 07:07.027
No arguing, Gina.
Come on, let's go.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.673
I wonder if we'll ever see her again.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.145
Doubt it.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.358
I'm gonna get there first.
No, I am!

07:29.382 --> 07:31.695
No, I am!
Stop it.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.755
Hi, Shayla. What are you
doing here all by yourself?

07:35.322 --> 07:36.666
Come here, come here.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.101
Mom, I'm starving!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.636
Oh, stop.
Please, it's early.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.571
Stop it. Let's go
to Greg's, okay?

07:41.595 --> 07:44.307
Wait, Lane. I want...
Hand me Shayla.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.441
Okay.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.510
Shayla, go to Mom.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.168
Come here, baby.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.876
Come on, Shay.
Get cozy. Let's sleep.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.551
Hi, Sonny.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.205
Tag.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.531
No tag backs.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.672
<i>♪ I had a dream about leaving ♪</i>

08:28.141 --> 08:30.419
They always
have sugar every day.

08:30.443 --> 08:34.782
<i>♪ I had a dream of the past ♪</i>

08:39.587 --> 08:40.953
Anyone home?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.825
We can go in.
They don't care.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.745
Sky, you want some almonds?

08:55.769 --> 08:56.870
Sugar.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.549
Let's dance.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.117
I want some.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.499
I can't stay
on this fucking land?

09:50.523 --> 09:52.168
I thought it was
a goddamn free country.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.204
I don't know. You can't
just take whatever you want.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.307
They're plants, man.
And they grow for free.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.709
Besides, they belong to God.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.745
I mean, what's with this
fucking ownership bullshit?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.112
Well, those are the rules.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.981
I thought this place was
supposed to be free of rules,

10:05.005 --> 10:07.240
but it's like
the goddamn Gestapo.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.177
Fuck!

10:10.844 --> 10:12.780
What am I gonna do?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.862
I have no place to go.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.988
Are we kicked off the land now?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.391
Oh, fuck.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.504
Where are we going?

10:28.528 --> 10:30.139
I can't go to Bolinas, Clarise.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.075
I can't do it. I just...
I can't do it.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.734
You don't have to worry.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.007
You're gonna be all right.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.976
You guys have to go?

10:43.276 --> 10:44.311
Yeah.

10:44.945 --> 10:45.946
This...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.382
This always happens with my mom.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.187
She just has a hard time
getting along with other people.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.002
I told you to leave
those roller skates.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.637
These are the best things
I ever got from the free store.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.472
You haven't used them
in months, Lane.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.066
I can't use them on dirt roads!

11:08.001 --> 11:10.437
We can't take everything
with us.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.009
Don't get attached
to material goods, Lane.

11:16.777 --> 11:17.978
Big lesson.

11:20.647 --> 11:24.317
Kids, this is erasing
your freedom.

11:31.191 --> 11:36.005
<i>♪ Row, row, row your
boat Gently down the stream ♪</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:38.441
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily ♪</i>

11:38.465 --> 11:40.944
<i>♪ Life is but a dream ♪</i>

11:40.968 --> 11:45.882

11:45.906 --> 11:48.384

11:48.408 --> 11:50.377
<i>♪ Life is but a dream ♪</i>

12:05.492 --> 12:07.837
Hey, you talked to them?
How'd it go?

12:07.861 --> 12:10.807
Well, they didn't ask for
social security numbers,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.442
or previous addresses.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.746
So, I guess if your kids
are gonna go, you can go, too.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.414
We get to go to school!

12:18.438 --> 12:19.883
I don't wanna go.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.717
Hey, believe me. When
you see all the fun they're having

12:21.741 --> 12:23.352
at that kind of school,
you won't wanna miss out.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.520
When do we start?

12:24.544 --> 12:25.478
Uh...

12:26.313 --> 12:27.824
Tomorrow, I guess.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.925
Hey, but listen to me.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.860
You two, no shit food.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.061
Do you understand me?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.397
Jamie? If I catch
either one of you with it,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.432
I swear I'm gonna rip you
out of there so fast,

12:36.456 --> 12:37.901
it's gonna make your head spin.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.194
Please don't fuck with me
on this, kids, all right?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.964
What's that?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.478
What the hell is this?

12:49.502 --> 12:51.547
It's cheese.
Yeah, I know it's cheese.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.773
What the hell is cheese
doing in here?

12:54.074 --> 12:55.142
Huh?

12:55.943 --> 12:58.311
Does anyone know what's
in cheese?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.723
It's just milk.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.026
No, it's not just milk.
It's rennet.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.427
Do you know what rennet is?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.418
Huh?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.864
Do you?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.699
It's the lining of
a cow's stomach.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.235
Goddamn it! I swear.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.437
I can't get out of this place
for five minutes

13:14.461 --> 13:16.263
without it all going to shit.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.108
Goddamn it, Lane.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.267
Wake up!

13:21.969 --> 13:23.412
Get out of my way.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.537
Sorry.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.124
Do you know what
you're gonna wear tomorrow?

13:48.828 --> 13:53.566
Probably my rainbow
turtleneck sweater...

13:54.601 --> 13:57.004
and my flower bell bottoms.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.239
What are you wearing?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.819
I was thinking

14:03.843 --> 14:07.247
my white top, or my blue top.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.484
The white top is super stained.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.521
Then I'll just wear
the blue one.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.128
Oh.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.000
Lane, what's your dream house?

14:32.105 --> 14:32.973
Well...

14:35.775 --> 14:38.078
It would have a big backyard,

14:39.579 --> 14:41.148
with a pool...

14:45.152 --> 14:47.120
and it would have one of those

14:48.188 --> 14:51.491
covered patios next to the pool.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.031
And the house would be
super clean.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.267
And white.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.009
And I would sit by the pool...

15:12.379 --> 15:15.024
And my mom would
be super pretty.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.517
She'd brush my hair.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.200
Are you done with yours?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.834
Do you wanna grab
Berry's for me, please?

15:30.497 --> 15:31.564
Spoon.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.748
Hello.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.174
You must be the new kids.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.143
I'm Susan.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.321
Over there is Kevin.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.756
Why don't you come on in,
take your shoes off.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.215
Join us.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.463
Where is your dad?

19:24.096 --> 19:25.232
Claude?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.300
New Mexico.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.571
I don't know where
Shayla's dad is, though.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.750
Truck.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.175
Get out of the road.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.378
Come on.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.389
Okay, let's go.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.704
Can we get a ride?

19:55.728 --> 19:56.796
Thank you.

Boys, go get me firewood.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.359
Lane.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.552
We need to get this fire started.
Come on.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.164
All right. I'm gonna need
more than that.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.625
Hey, Shayla.
Help me find the rice, okay?

21:15.308 --> 21:17.276
Hey, Berry.
Stay out of the water.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.550
Berry, I don't want you
to get wet.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.902
Hey. I've been
looking for you.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.672
Look what I found.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.443
Wow.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.556
I love that.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.915
If I lived in the city,
I'd wear that for sure.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.687
I would be...

22:02.088 --> 22:03.055
her.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.494
Um... her.

22:10.897 --> 22:11.864
I'm her.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.666
I'm her!

22:16.068 --> 22:18.280
God! I like everything in here.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.148
Really?
Yeah.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.784
Even bras.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.075
Even furniture.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.652
Wow.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.855
So pretty.

22:42.895 --> 22:43.930
We should take it.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.634
No one will know.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.726
All right, everyone.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.429
Five minutes
until we go outside.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.896
Let's clean up.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.055
Five minutes.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.393
Five minutes.
We're gonna head out.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.107
"The princess looked
to the riverbed in dismay.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.086
And there she saw
thousands of rocks

23:31.110 --> 23:34.122
over which the magical river
had once flowed.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.626
'How am I to know which rock he's
trapped in?' the young girl wailed.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.752
The little fairy queen replied,

23:41.287 --> 23:43.089
'You must pick up each rock

23:45.324 --> 23:47.470
and listen to it carefully,

23:47.494 --> 23:49.472
and if you choose the rock
in which he is trapped,

23:49.496 --> 23:51.807
you will hear his voice
calling out to you.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.943
Then neither he nor you
shall ever be lonely again.'

23:54.967 --> 23:58.046
And with this, the little
fairy queen vanished.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.082
The girl dried her tears,

24:00.106 --> 24:01.850
and seeing no other option,

24:01.874 --> 24:05.320
began to pick up the rocks
and put them to her ear.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.222
For three nights and three days,

24:07.246 --> 24:08.791
she patiently picked up
each rock

24:08.815 --> 24:10.617
and listened tenderly to it.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.561
Her ears grew sore,

24:12.585 --> 24:15.488
her throat grew dry,
and her lips began to crack.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.533
Yet, she kept on.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.668
For she knew if she
did not give up,

24:19.692 --> 24:21.127
she would find it."

24:45.317 --> 24:46.653
Berry.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.497
Berry!

24:48.521 --> 24:49.832
Berry, this isn't funny.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.335
If you are hiding,
come out right now!

24:53.359 --> 24:55.203
I told you to keep
an eye on the kids.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.304
Calm down, Clarise.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.797
I'm not gonna calm down.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.309
Jamie, if you know
where Berry is,

25:01.333 --> 25:03.311
I need you to tell me right now.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.704
I don't know!

25:10.176 --> 25:11.554
Berry!

25:11.578 --> 25:13.780
Berry! Berry!

25:16.849 --> 25:17.750
Berry!

25:18.217 --> 25:19.752
Berry!

25:35.868 --> 25:37.512
What was your
kid doing in the water?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.114
Get the hell away from me.
Is he all right?

25:39.138 --> 25:40.515
I said, get the hell away!

25:49.448 --> 25:50.993
Don't take him to
the hospital, man.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.785
Death culture there.
Get out of my way.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.170
Come on, Sky.
Let's go.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.539
Look, can you at least leave
food stamps or something?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.608
Anything for us?

26:05.632 --> 26:07.634
Sky, we're leaving.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.201
Now.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.747
Lane, take your sister.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.050
Jamie...

26:59.218 --> 27:01.754
Come on. Let's move this
over here, okay?

27:13.499 --> 27:14.901
What now?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.402
Well...

27:17.469 --> 27:18.938
We're gonna go into the city.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.951
But I thought you hate the city.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.787
I don't have a choice anymore.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.212
You're gonna take this.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.890
Come here, baby.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.457
Come on, let's go.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.259
Okay. Let's go for a walk.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.852
Come on, guys.
Hurry up.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.282
Hey, Lane. Take your sister.
Come on.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.752
Here. Go with Lane, okay?

28:16.595 --> 28:18.130
Who is she calling?

28:18.798 --> 28:21.376
Um, Ethel, maybe.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.745
Who's Ethel?

28:22.769 --> 28:23.779
Our grandma.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.313
We have a grandma?

28:25.337 --> 28:26.749
Yeah.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.183
You're probably too young
to remember her,

28:28.207 --> 28:29.918
but you took a shit
on her floor,

28:29.942 --> 28:32.344
and she freaked out
the last time I saw her.

28:35.647 --> 28:36.983
Come on, Shayla.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.526
Go with Jamie.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.919
Come on.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.198
Go with Jamie.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.290
Come on, Shayla.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.372
Hey, Mom.
Hi, it's Karen.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.144
Yeah. Yeah, no.
It's me.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.489
Beat it. Come on.

29:07.513 --> 29:08.981
Yeah, it's me.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.427
Yeah, well...

29:12.451 --> 29:15.521
Well, I was thinking we haven't
seen each other, and I was...

29:17.289 --> 29:19.634
maybe thinking I could
come over tomorrow.

29:19.658 --> 29:20.860
We can all come over.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.300
I know, I know, I know.
It's been a while. But...

29:29.768 --> 29:31.170
I thought...

29:34.673 --> 29:36.275
we could come by and say hi.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.345
Jamie, bring Shayla.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.314
Okay.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.218
Then tomorrow.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.089
Okay.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.993
Yeah, Mom...

29:58.497 --> 29:59.798
Let me see your teeth.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.433
Wipe.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.469
Okay, me?

30:04.503 --> 30:06.305
Okay. Let me see your teeth.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.886
Well, you're gonna piss in
something, wear it for two days.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.320
Are you happy?

30:16.582 --> 30:17.725
Let's go.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.661
I just... I don't
understand you, Lane.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.163
I want you to be Cleopatra

30:21.187 --> 30:23.765
and you just insist
on being Minnie Mouse.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.600
Come on, come on.
Get the shit. Let's go.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.126
Move it. Come on.

30:27.759 --> 30:28.961
Come on.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.573
Come here, Shayla.
Come on.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.875
Yeah.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.366
I know. Let's go.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.052
Come on, kids, come on.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.111
Yes!

30:47.613 --> 30:50.182
Don't do it so many times.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.921
Hi, Mom.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.356
Uh, this is Shayla.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.391
I think you haven't met.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.094
Go inside. Go inside.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.775
As long as there was such a base,

31:07.799 --> 31:09.878
I felt strongly that
it was necessary

31:09.902 --> 31:13.248
to see the constitutional process
through to its conclusion...

31:13.272 --> 31:16.242
Hey, Jamie.
Don't touch that. Please.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.286
Is this you?

31:18.310 --> 31:19.988
In another life. Yeah.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.523
Yeah!

31:21.547 --> 31:23.291
No, no, Jamie. You know better than that.
Don't touch that.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.627
They don't eat this, Mom.
I'm sorry.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.419
Take this to the kitchen.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.334
The kids, Mom...

31:32.358 --> 31:34.736
they got you some presents
they found at the beach.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.770
Right, guys?

31:35.794 --> 31:38.273
You wanna give these to Grandma?

31:38.297 --> 31:40.232
Jamie, take your sister
and go in the back.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.777
Hey, Lane?

31:42.801 --> 31:43.811
Come here.

31:43.835 --> 31:44.937
Come on.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.790
Are you praying, Karen?

31:55.814 --> 31:57.083
Oh, God.

31:57.984 --> 32:01.129
You could at least
pray for your brother.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.897
I'm sorry, no amount of praying

32:02.921 --> 32:05.100
is gonna save anyone
from dying in a war.

32:05.124 --> 32:08.403
From the discussions I have had
with Congressional and other leaders,

32:08.427 --> 32:09.504
I have concluded...

32:09.528 --> 32:10.805
I'm sorry.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.975
That because
of the Watergate matter...

32:12.999 --> 32:14.776
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that,

32:14.800 --> 32:17.069
and I do pray for him...

32:18.070 --> 32:19.338
in my own way.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.344
I'm sorry. I just need
a little air for a minute.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.479
Lane, just...

32:28.414 --> 32:29.448
sit still.

32:41.727 --> 32:45.107
Hey, Mom. We're only gonna
be in the city for a few hours.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.199
Do you need money again, Karen?

32:51.203 --> 32:52.914
Oh, Mom.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.673
Thank you. This...
Oh, wow.

32:55.374 --> 32:58.020
Oh, Mom.
Thank you so much.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.687
Oh, this is great for the kids.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.289
Jamie, bring Shayla.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.058
Oh, thank you.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.460
Hey, come here. Come say goodbye.
Come here.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.261
Come on.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.762
Come say goodbye to Grandma.

33:07.786 --> 33:08.997
Say goodbye to Grandma.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.565
Say, "Bye, Grandma."

33:10.589 --> 33:11.866
Thank you, Mom, so much.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.068
It's gonna help me out.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.360
Goodbye, Karen.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.972
Come on, Lane.
Let's go.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.998
Come on, Shayla.
Let's go.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.334
Come on.

33:37.316 --> 33:40.018
That woman is a heavy trip, man.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.054
Heavy trip.

33:53.565 --> 33:54.376
Hey, sister.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.444
Oh, my magical sister.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.636
Come on in.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.544
Oh.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.717
Sit down.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.588
Lane, go find Puma.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.101
Oh, God.
I just can't.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.803
I need a break.
It's just too much.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.530
I feel like a...
It's awful.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.833
Hello?

34:52.858 --> 34:54.193
Come in.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.300
Hi.

35:05.971 --> 35:06.872
Hi.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.085
Can I come in?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.578
I said you could come in.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.747
Close the door.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.295
Mm-hmm.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.599
So...

35:35.033 --> 35:37.303
Who are you here with?

35:38.904 --> 35:40.872
My mom, Hallelujah.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.742
Hallelujah is your mother?

35:48.647 --> 35:51.383
So you guys are from
the country, right?

35:51.850 --> 35:53.428
Yeah.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.721
No way in hell
I'd live out there.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.490
Snakes, spiders,

35:59.157 --> 36:00.492
bugs...

36:01.026 --> 36:02.361
Gross.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.216
You want some?

36:27.786 --> 36:28.887
Okay.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.988
Here.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.847
You should always
have fresh breath.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.689
You need some mascara.

37:04.690 --> 37:05.891
And some gel blush.

37:07.793 --> 37:08.860
Can I put it on you?

37:18.837 --> 37:19.871
Um...

37:24.643 --> 37:25.744
Yeah.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.321
I'm good at makeup.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.361
I'm gonna be a cosmetologist.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.939
As soon as I'm 16.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.275
I move into Chicago.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.667
There's this lady there...

37:49.167 --> 37:50.502
Cookie...

37:52.203 --> 37:53.572
She's a black lady.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.842
She's friends with my real dad.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.979
She owns her own salon.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.920
She said she always
wanted a daughter like me.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.928
But I don't know. We're
really more like sisters.

38:23.369 --> 38:24.736
Look down.

38:50.228 --> 38:51.663
Try this tube top.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.477
Come on.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.870
I don't think I have anything that'll
fit you on the bottom though.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.874
Maybe I can make
a wraparound skirt.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.581
That shirt looks good
with those jeans.

39:10.949 --> 39:11.983
Here.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.262
You can keep my roll-on
sparkle if you wanna.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.898
Thank you.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.991
Try on these shoes.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.548
You look pretty.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.985
Let's take a picture.

40:22.454 --> 40:23.755
You look good.

40:25.390 --> 40:26.658
Stand up.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.308
Stand over here.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.934
I need you to pose, okay?

40:37.969 --> 40:40.782
Why you looking scared?
You never posed before?

40:40.806 --> 40:42.207
You don't know how to pose?

40:42.874 --> 40:43.909
No.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.121
Okay. This hand...

40:47.145 --> 40:49.023
This hand, put it on your hip.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.582
Now pop your hip.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.219
Pop your hip.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.154
Pop it.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.457
More than that.
You go to...

40:59.791 --> 41:00.968
pop it.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.737
Yeah, okay.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.163
And I want you
to look at the ground

41:06.264 --> 41:07.866
very seriously.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.136
Ready?

41:11.537 --> 41:14.015
One, two...

41:15.340 --> 41:17.251
That was pretty good.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.986
Let's do one more, okay?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.421
There's a boy you like.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.123
Look at this boy you like.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.158
Lure him in

41:24.182 --> 41:25.617
with your eyes.

41:27.285 --> 41:29.063
One, two...

41:30.321 --> 41:31.623
That was good.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.496
Hey, Lane, come on.
We have to go.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.772
Now, Lane.
Move it

41:53.344 --> 41:54.780
Come on, let's go.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.116
Where's Shayla?

41:59.818 --> 42:00.828
Mom!

42:00.852 --> 42:02.396
She's gonna stay here
for a while. Come on.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.933
No.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.602
Mom, I don't wanna
leave her here.

42:07.626 --> 42:08.703
Come on, right now.

42:08.727 --> 42:10.261
I'm not leaving her here.

42:10.929 --> 42:11.906
She's my sister!

42:11.930 --> 42:13.440
Lane, I don't have time
for your histrionics.

42:13.464 --> 42:14.909
Come on.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.381
I'm not playing a game.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.515
Shayla's staying here,

42:21.539 --> 42:22.984
and Claude's gonna come
and get you and Jamie,

42:23.008 --> 42:24.151
and that's the way
it's gonna be,

42:24.175 --> 42:25.644
because I'm tired of this shit.
Come on.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.580
Charlie, shut the door.

43:58.737 --> 44:00.514
What are you making?

44:00.538 --> 44:02.007
I'm building an airplane.

44:03.608 --> 44:04.843
Okay.

44:30.101 --> 44:32.738
Do you think Dad's really
coming to get us?

44:33.038 --> 44:34.648
No.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.009
You have a better chance of flying
out of here on your airplane.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.756
Jamie, stop it for a second.

44:51.622 --> 44:52.791
Stop it.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.166
Daddy!

45:47.212 --> 45:48.814
Hey there, little buddy.

45:50.048 --> 45:52.026
Hi, Daddy! Hi, Daddy!
Hi, Daddy! Hi, Daddy!

45:52.050 --> 45:53.494
Hi, Daddy!
Hey, you remember me?

45:53.518 --> 45:55.296
Hi, Daddy! Hi, Daddy!
Hi, Daddy!

45:55.320 --> 45:56.764
How are you doing?

45:56.788 --> 45:58.256
Hi, Daddy!

46:00.691 --> 46:02.169
Hey, you. Little girl.

46:02.193 --> 46:04.438
What are you doing
all the way over there?

46:04.462 --> 46:05.763
Come here.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.801
Hi.

46:13.338 --> 46:14.940
Wow, you guys are big.

46:18.376 --> 46:21.288
This is where I'm building
an airplane out of spare parts.

46:21.312 --> 46:24.758
This is the gearbox.
This is the intake manifold.

46:24.782 --> 46:25.927
They connect to...

46:25.951 --> 46:27.895
Jamie, take Claude to
the campsite, okay?

46:27.919 --> 46:28.996
Come on, let's go find your mom.

46:29.020 --> 46:30.255
Show me this later.

46:35.293 --> 46:36.770
Cool truck, huh?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.898
This guy's paying me money to take
it all the way back to New Mexico.

46:41.366 --> 46:43.244
Hmm.

46:43.268 --> 46:46.171
So you finally found a reason
to come back to California.

46:48.006 --> 46:49.807
So glad you could
finally make it.

46:57.582 --> 47:00.594
Over here is where we sleep.

47:00.618 --> 47:02.830
And that's the shitter there.

47:02.854 --> 47:05.132
And over there is where
Mom meditates.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.069
Yeah? Oh,
it's meditating now, huh?

47:08.093 --> 47:09.770
Still throw the I Ching?

47:09.794 --> 47:11.472
How about the runes?

47:11.496 --> 47:13.064
Mommy still throw the runes?

47:15.066 --> 47:16.477
What are you doing?

47:18.203 --> 47:19.570
Okay.

47:24.876 --> 47:26.287
I'm gonna try to knock you off.

47:26.311 --> 47:28.322
How's that?

47:28.346 --> 47:30.081
Whaa!
Whoa!

47:44.963 --> 47:46.998
You know, you look
a lot like my mom.

47:47.732 --> 47:49.076
Doesn't she, Karen?

47:49.100 --> 47:50.511
She looks like Lorraine.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.869
I told you I changed my name.

47:52.904 --> 47:54.215
Dad, you know my airplane?

47:54.239 --> 47:56.717
Well, it can also
turn into a spaceship.

47:56.741 --> 47:58.152
Is Lorraine still alive?

47:58.176 --> 48:01.088
The intake manifold is
2,000 years' power.

48:01.112 --> 48:04.358
The suspension is
double rack and pinion.

48:04.382 --> 48:07.828
And the navigation
is inertial and gyroscopic,

48:07.852 --> 48:09.487
and is radar, too.

48:11.089 --> 48:13.992
Yeah, she's alive and living
in Las Vegas.

48:16.494 --> 48:19.630
You know, it's a shame she hasn't
seen you since you were a baby.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.010
She loved you so much.

48:23.034 --> 48:24.936
What?

48:26.437 --> 48:28.906
She has a good heart,
no matter what you think.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.497
I think it's time for bed.

48:43.521 --> 48:46.167
Dad, do you wanna
work on it with me tomorrow?

48:46.191 --> 48:47.668
I gotta leave tomorrow.

48:47.692 --> 48:49.094
Are we going with you?

48:52.530 --> 48:55.133
You gotta talk
to your mom about that.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.045
She wants us to go.

48:58.069 --> 48:59.470
I'll see.

49:01.606 --> 49:02.940
Lane...

49:03.408 --> 49:04.618
Right?

49:04.642 --> 49:06.787
Didn't that...
Didn't you say that...

49:06.811 --> 49:08.789
I want you to go to bed.

49:08.813 --> 49:10.524
Jamie, you, too.

49:10.548 --> 49:13.318
Get your things.
Get your bag, it's late.

49:20.425 --> 49:22.293
Good night.
Good night.

49:27.198 --> 49:28.366
Go to sleep.

49:31.669 --> 49:34.072
Don't paint me as the bad guy.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.084
Do you hear me?

49:37.108 --> 49:39.044
You don't know
my situation, all right?

49:39.910 --> 49:40.988
Don't argue with me.

49:41.012 --> 49:43.714
Look, I just want you to
be a father...

49:44.882 --> 49:46.293
and uphold your obligations.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.495
I just take both of the kids?
I just take them away?

49:48.519 --> 49:50.564
Yeah, that's
what a dad does, right?

49:50.588 --> 49:52.457
Yeah, but...
I don't care.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.269
They need their father.

49:55.293 --> 49:57.271
I can barely take
care of myself, all right?

49:57.295 --> 50:00.098
You're not the only
one who's entitled to a life.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.666
Get in.

50:25.690 --> 50:27.024
Get inside.

50:39.804 --> 50:40.781
Get around front.

50:40.805 --> 50:41.739
Fine.

50:47.011 --> 50:48.546
Wait!

50:50.981 --> 50:52.583
Wait!

50:57.322 --> 50:58.323
Dad!

51:01.092 --> 51:02.693
Come back!

51:09.700 --> 51:11.136
Jamie!

51:17.675 --> 51:19.110
Come back!

51:25.650 --> 51:27.418
Don't leave me here!

51:34.825 --> 51:38.196
You forgot about me!

52:54.605 --> 52:55.606
Lane.

53:02.947 --> 53:04.558
You have to understand.

53:04.582 --> 53:06.884
Sometimes, things in life don't
happen the way you want 'em to.

53:07.618 --> 53:10.864
Some things we just don't get.

53:10.888 --> 53:14.292
You're just thinking about all that
shit food Claude was gonna feed you.

53:15.593 --> 53:16.603
Now, come on.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.739
There's someone
I want you to meet.

53:18.763 --> 53:19.864
Come and get some rice.

54:02.106 --> 54:03.474
Lane.

54:20.425 --> 54:23.304
Lane, this is Tom Starchild.

54:23.328 --> 54:26.464
He's joining me in
meditation and purification.

54:35.373 --> 54:37.442
We need to give thanks for this rice.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.282
Thank you for the rice.

59:03.073 --> 59:04.174
Lane...

59:05.175 --> 59:06.110
This...

59:08.012 --> 59:09.313
is made with peyote.

59:11.115 --> 59:11.958
It's very powerful

59:11.982 --> 59:14.728
and it puts you in
direct contact

59:14.752 --> 59:16.821
with the Holy Spirit.

59:17.955 --> 59:20.867
We're gonna drink this
for our vision quest.

59:20.891 --> 59:22.559
Would you like to try some?

59:56.861 --> 59:59.697
Is peyote what give you
the highest high?

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.069
A man and a woman making love
is the highest high.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.817
Fuck! Ugh!

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:48.652
Hey!

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.322
Hey.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.500
Hi.

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:57.370
Um, can I get a ride?

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.772
I'm only going as
far as the bus depot.

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:01.198
That's okay.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.469
Yeah. Get in the back.
Thanks.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.350
Hello.

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:19.009
Hi, um...

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.112
This is Lane calling.

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.548
I'm Claude's daughter.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:31.831
Hello?

01:06:31.855 --> 01:06:33.223
Just a minute.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.600
You're Claude's daughter?

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.169
Yeah.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:49.739
Lane, yeah.

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:53.277
I met you when you were a baby.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:57.157
That was a lot of years ago.

01:06:57.181 --> 01:06:59.825
Is it okay if I come
stay with you for a while?

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.752
Please deposit 10
cents for the next four minutes.

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:05.131
Thank you.

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:06.999
Lane?
Hello?

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.101
Lane, are you there?

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:10.170
I don't have much time
on the phone.

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:12.538
I'm coming on a bus from
Santa Rosa, California.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:14.807
We're sorry. Please
try your call again later.

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:16.008
I'm leaving today.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.009
Okay...

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.649
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.585
We're in Vegas.
Last stop.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:48.505
You're Lane?

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:52.985
Yeah.
Is that your bag?

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.920
That all you brought?
Yeah.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.590
Okay. Well, we'll get
some more things.

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.559
Go on that side of the car,
get in there now.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.017
We got a party at home.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.853
A party?
Yeah.

01:12:05.789 --> 01:12:07.824
Come on.
Everybody's waiting.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.059
Okay.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:45.771
