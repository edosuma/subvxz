00:09.000 --> 00:10.900
Woman: Hey!

00:10.900 --> 00:13.900
**

00:20.367 --> 00:22.033
All: Hey!

00:22.033 --> 00:23.933
Aloha, bitches.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.133
Ah.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.600
Narrator:
Coming up on a special

00:28.600 --> 00:31.333
hour-long episode of
"Impractical Jokers"...

00:31.333 --> 00:33.333
Hoo-hahh!

00:33.333 --> 00:35.400
Narrator:
...is Murr in too deep...

00:37.800 --> 00:39.733
...what's got Joe
keeping the beat..

00:39.733 --> 00:41.033
Hah-kah!

00:41.033 --> 00:43.100
Oh, my God!

00:43.100 --> 00:45.400
Narrator:
...and which losing joker
will be shark bait

00:45.400 --> 00:47.133
in tonight's punishment?

00:49.100 --> 00:51.167
Sal: Prepare for
something amazing.

00:51.167 --> 00:52.800
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:54.533 --> 00:56.133
Murr: I want my mommy!

00:57.933 --> 01:00.700
Sal: I will never
forgive you!

01:00.700 --> 01:02.600
Joe: Larry!

01:07.067 --> 01:08.600
**

01:08.600 --> 01:11.367
Today we're at the Chief's Luau
at Sea Life Park,

01:11.367 --> 01:14.400
offering mystical readings
to the attendees.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.067
While reading stranger's
fortune, we're gonna have to do

01:17.067 --> 01:18.967
and say whatever
the other guys tell us to.

01:18.967 --> 01:21.567
Joe: At the end of the reading,
we're gonna ask them for a tip.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.733
If you don't get a tip,
you lose.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.833
The human maraca.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.167
Get it

01:29.167 --> 01:30.533
-Oh!
-Murr-aca!

01:30.533 --> 01:33.567
**

01:36.833 --> 01:41.567
-Hang loose, baby.
-Hanging loose, baby.

01:41.567 --> 01:42.933
Hello, hello.
How are you, sir?

01:42.933 --> 01:44.567
-I'm good.
-All right, he's in.

01:44.567 --> 01:46.700
-We got a double.

01:46.700 --> 01:49.300
-Great.
-Lovely. Now, I'm not a psychic.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.100
Basically, what I do
is I just read energy.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.833
"Do psychic readings."

01:52.833 --> 01:54.067
Interpret it
through the cards,

01:54.067 --> 01:55.667
psychic readings,
stuff like that.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.233
Pick a card -- any card.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.100
Murr: Now, Q,
look at it, study it.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.667
"Oh."
-Oh!

02:06.667 --> 02:09.133
"According to this,
you died six weeks ago."

02:11.767 --> 02:14.733
According to this,
you died six weeks ago.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.600
Now, is that --
Is that an issue

02:16.600 --> 02:18.767
that the two of you
were aware of?

02:18.767 --> 02:22.067
-Be like, "Oh, not ago."

02:22.067 --> 02:24.933
Oh, not ago.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.367
Okay,
let's pick another card.

02:27.867 --> 02:30.533
Six weeks from now.

02:30.533 --> 02:32.533
Let's just do that again.
Let's just do that.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.433
"There's nothing to fear
about the afternoon, right?"

02:34.433 --> 02:36.367
There's nothing to fear
about the afterlife.

02:36.367 --> 02:37.733
"For example,
I can't wait to die."

02:37.733 --> 02:39.967
Yeah.
No, I can't wait to die.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.967
"Mostly because there's
a ghost I want to bang."

02:41.967 --> 02:44.100
Uh, mostly,
there's this ghost

02:44.100 --> 02:46.167
that I want to,
uh

02:46.167 --> 02:49.667
Yeah, so I'm really
looking forward to that.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.233
Uh...

02:52.233 --> 02:54.500
Sal: "It says here,
you have a cousin..."

02:54.500 --> 02:58.433
So, it says here,
you have a cousin, yes?

02:58.433 --> 03:00.067
"...who fantasizes
about you."

03:00.067 --> 03:03.433
-...who fantasizes about you.
-Oh!

03:03.433 --> 03:04.933
Now, you're gonna want
to explore that.

03:04.933 --> 03:07.867
I don't know about that.

03:07.867 --> 03:09.767
Sharon?

03:09.767 --> 03:11.167
Uh, great.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.367
"There's a bowl
of chicken bones

03:12.367 --> 03:14.167
under the table.
Let's go old-school

03:14.167 --> 03:15.800
and just throw the chicken
bones on the table."

03:15.800 --> 03:17.067
Just throw them
on the table.

03:17.067 --> 03:18.900
Let's go old-school.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.067
All right.

03:21.067 --> 03:24.167
"Looks like there's breast
and thighs in your future."

03:24.167 --> 03:26.400
You got some breast
and thighs in your future.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.700
Yeah.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.500
"Don't worry, you got
a few bones coming your way."

03:31.500 --> 03:33.100
Oh, my God.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.933
Yeah, don't worry,
don't worry.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.367
Am I -- Uh...

03:37.367 --> 03:39.133
Don't worry,
you got, uh...

03:39.133 --> 03:41.133
Yeah, oh, man.
Don't worry, you got a --

03:41.133 --> 03:43.833
Yeah.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.833
Oh, man. All right, well,
hey, don't worry.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.200
Uh, you got a few bones
coming your way, too.

03:49.433 --> 03:51.067
There you go. That's it.
You guys, enjoy the --

03:51.067 --> 03:52.133
You know, totally free.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.767
We do accept tips
if you're feeling,

03:53.767 --> 03:55.933
you know, mahalo.

03:55.933 --> 03:57.100
Oh, thank you so much.

03:57.100 --> 04:00.633
-Oh!
-Mahalo.

04:00.633 --> 04:01.800
Come here now

04:01.800 --> 04:03.300
for your free
Hawaiian mystic reading.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.067
-That's not --
-That's the Caribbean.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.667
That's the Caribbean.
Almost the entire
opposite end of the world.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.833
-James.
-Hey. Kyle.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.167
Kyle, nice to meet you.
Let's get started.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.967
"When did you
leave Smash Mouth?"

04:16.667 --> 04:19.933
When did you leave
Smash Mouth?

04:19.933 --> 04:21.167
Yes.

04:21.167 --> 04:23.400
Oh, you weren't
in Smash Mouth?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.533
Oh. Okay.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.367
So, here, what we've got --
let me show you --

04:29.367 --> 04:32.067
this is your love, this is
your passion in life, okay?

04:32.067 --> 04:33.600
-"Oh, wait a second."
-Wait a second.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.933
"You should have been black."

04:37.900 --> 04:41.333
Just looking at the --
the 9 of Swords...

04:41.333 --> 04:44.700
you should have been black.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.067
But you know that already.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.567
Now,
as I continue to read...

04:49.567 --> 04:51.767
"Please put some pressure
on your nipples."

04:53.167 --> 04:54.333
...what I need you to do --

04:54.333 --> 04:56.633
I need you to hold
your chi in.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.933
Put pressure on your nipples
as I continue to read.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.167
Let's go. Okay.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.400
-Rub his earlobes.
-Ace of Cups.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.833
One sec. Lean close.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.267
Joe: Clap three times.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.400
"That wasn't for
the fortunetelling."

05:13.400 --> 05:15.933
Um, none of that was
for the fortunetelling.

05:18.433 --> 05:19.833
Yes, we're almost done.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.467
"Everyone in the office
thinks you're a size queen."

05:24.467 --> 05:26.767
That's not gonna happen.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.300
And we are not
accepting tips, either.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.133
Thank you. Go back.
Enjoy Hawaii.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.433
Thank you, sir.
You were great.

05:31.433 --> 05:34.467
Mahalo.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.267
Hi.
How are you today?

05:38.267 --> 05:40.133
-We're in. Let's do it.

05:40.133 --> 05:41.433
Let me take out
the crystals.

05:41.433 --> 05:42.967
I just want you
to hold the bag

05:42.967 --> 05:45.667
and, uh, just tell me
a little bit about yourself.

05:45.667 --> 05:46.833
"Cup the bag."

05:48.600 --> 05:50.900
Cup the bag.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.267
I want you to hold it
in your palm.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.900
Hold it?

05:53.900 --> 05:55.533
"Yeah, not so tight,
not so tight."

05:59.633 --> 06:01.667
Not so tight, not so tight.

06:01.667 --> 06:05.533
She's cupping
the bag too tight. Oh.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.867
Okay, these represent...

06:08.867 --> 06:10.300
"These represent
the Lollipop Guild."

06:10.300 --> 06:13.533
These little guys here
represent the Lollipop Guild.

06:13.533 --> 06:17.067
Um, they welcome you to...

06:17.067 --> 06:18.600
Munchkin Land.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.667
Start throwing the rocks at her.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.200
You're not here with family?

06:24.267 --> 06:26.500
This is your first trip
in quite some time?

06:26.500 --> 06:29.633
So you've taken
a trip recently?

06:31.233 --> 06:32.900
So, recently you've
gone to Vietnam?

06:32.900 --> 06:33.900
Mm-hmm.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.633
Sal.

06:36.633 --> 06:39.500
-Sal, hold her hands.
-Put your hand here and here.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.967
Murr: Now close your eyes
and concentrate.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.133
Close your eyes and just
concentrate for a second.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.233
Ask her to now
tell you a story

06:45.233 --> 06:47.400
when she was extremely happy.
-Tell me about a --

06:47.400 --> 06:49.333
a moment or a little story
in your life

06:49.333 --> 06:52.100
from a time that you knew
you that were extremely happy.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.500
-Hmm.
-When she's speaking,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.567
I want you to say, "I'm trying
to see into your future,

06:55.567 --> 06:56.967
so shut the  up
for a second."

06:58.300 --> 06:59.433
Hmm.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.733
Q: He's not gonna say this.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.367
All right, well, if you could
just shut the  up

07:09.367 --> 07:11.367
for one second,
I'm gonna read your future.

07:11.367 --> 07:14.300
Okay?

07:14.300 --> 07:15.800
I see a good future
for them.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.200
-Yes, I do.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.833
So, that's the whole thing.

07:20.833 --> 07:23.133
And again, completely free.
We don't ask for anything.

07:23.133 --> 07:26.100
We do accept tips. You
don't have to at all. Feel
zero pressure to do that.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.600
-He is not getting a tip.
-No way.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.567
-Yeah! I knew it. No way.
-See ya later.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.833
Oh. Aloha.

07:35.833 --> 07:36.900
How are you?

07:36.900 --> 07:38.133
Very good.
Have a seat.

07:38.133 --> 07:39.367
What's your name?
-Victoria.

07:39.367 --> 07:40.767
Victoria. Joe.
Nice to see you.

07:40.767 --> 07:42.967
Point to your mouth
and make kissy -- kissy noises.

07:42.967 --> 07:46.167
All right. Uh...

07:47.633 --> 07:51.100
No, okay, I misread that.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.433
Okay, here we go.
So, we'll start here.

07:52.433 --> 07:55.167
Just pick anybody
out of this pack here.

07:55.167 --> 07:57.833
Good.
Point to the flower in her
hair till she gives it to you.

07:57.833 --> 08:00.467
Oh, I noticed --
uh, in your hair.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.267
Hey, do you mind
if I just -- Yeah.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.333
Yeah,
just here real quick.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.833
Pop it in your mouth.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.500
This one here is
a little bit of hardship --

08:10.500 --> 08:11.833
being able to go
through hardship.
Oh.

08:11.833 --> 08:13.333
And this one here
is a little bit more that

08:13.333 --> 08:14.533
you're gonna have...
-Here we go.

08:14.533 --> 08:16.367
-...more fun in your life.
-Oh, that's good.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.700
Uh, just has --

08:20.700 --> 08:22.133
you know, just
getting the essence.

08:22.133 --> 08:23.667
Just getting the essence.
-Yeah, yeah.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.233
Yeah, just -- You know,
we'll just have some fun here,

08:25.233 --> 08:27.067
so you can put that back
in your hair whenever you want.

08:27.067 --> 08:29.233
-Oh, okay.
-Okay, so...

08:29.233 --> 08:32.067
-These are Hawaiian tarot.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.567
-Okay.
Okay.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.400
Joe, just go wide-eyed
at that card.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.433
Another card.

08:40.433 --> 08:41.667
Give me -- Give me
one second here.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.067
Let me...

08:48.533 --> 08:50.367
Joe, do every card literal.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.800
You're here with two cups?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.700
-Uh, I mean, I guess --

08:53.700 --> 08:56.500
Oh, no.
Are you drinking
out of two cups?

08:56.500 --> 08:59.367
You're not drinking
out of two cups?

08:59.367 --> 09:01.067
Okay. You didn't
bring three cups?

09:02.733 --> 09:04.133
Victoria: Maybe later.
I don't know what the
is happening.

09:06.733 --> 09:08.267
And you didn't bring
a sword or two?

09:08.267 --> 09:10.067
No.
So that doesn't
make sense, either.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.800
That was a 2 of Swords.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.800
Change it into
a game of blackjack.

09:16.233 --> 09:19.067
Okay, are you -- Here you go.
Okay, 10 of Cups here.

09:19.067 --> 09:20.133
So, now you got the 9 of Cups
and 10 of Cups.

09:21.267 --> 09:23.400
That's 19.
-Oh, okay.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.467
Okay, I'm -- I'm showing
the ace of Swords.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.333
You want to hit this?

09:27.333 --> 09:30.067
-Uh...
-Great.

09:30.067 --> 09:31.700
Bust.
-"Breakfast comp."

09:31.700 --> 09:33.933
Okay, so, I could get you
a breakfast comp.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.567
I could talk to the pit boss
and see what else we could do.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.067
Joe, we hid a plastic bag,

09:41.067 --> 09:42.567
and there's a cotton
swab in there.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.200
-Okay.
-No.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.233
The last thing
I like to do here

09:47.233 --> 09:48.700
is I like
to really get in --

09:48.700 --> 09:51.100
So, this here is a cotton swab.
-"To swab inside of your mouth."

09:51.100 --> 09:52.467
Okay, so, I'm gonna swab you
inside of your mouth.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.867
It's just -- It's okay.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.067
You can do it yourself
if you want. It's clean.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.100
Yeah, you got it, yeah.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.733
Q: Now put it
in the plastic bag.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.200
Great. Yeah.

10:03.367 --> 10:04.900
No, no, no.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.200
This is completely free, but if
you'd like to leave a tip,

10:08.200 --> 10:09.833
if you had a good time,
it's up to you.

10:09.833 --> 10:12.300
Oh, thank you so much.
-Oh!

10:12.300 --> 10:14.033
-Thank you.
-Come on!

10:14.033 --> 10:16.233
Boys, you guys couldn't
pull it together.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.833
Me and Joe got them tips.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.867
**

10:21.700 --> 10:23.867
No, that's mine. Thank you.
Very good to see you.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.533
Get the
out, guys!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.967
Narrator: Misfortune follows
Murr and Sal,

10:36.967 --> 10:40.067
so they're saying aloha
to the loser board.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.067
Today we are going head-to-head
on Waikiki Beach,

10:45.067 --> 10:47.233
playing a game
called Pass the Message.

10:47.233 --> 10:49.233
To start, one of us
will be given a message

10:49.233 --> 10:50.500
that we have to
convince a stranger

10:50.500 --> 10:52.133
to pass along to other guy.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.300
And then that guy needs
to get the same stranger

10:54.300 --> 10:56.133
to deliver
another message back.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.333
This game goes
back and forth

10:57.333 --> 10:59.567
until the person refuses
to pass along the message.

10:59.567 --> 11:03.333
And if you can't get your
message delivered, you lose.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.467
Nothing we need to say.
Let's just get to it.

11:05.467 --> 11:06.500
You want to?
Let's just start it.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.600
Yeah.

11:10.233 --> 11:13.267
**

11:14.933 --> 11:17.200
Murr: There he is --
Surfer Joe.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.500
How you doing, dude?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.233
Brah, hang loose, man.
Good luck to you.

11:20.233 --> 11:21.833
Good luck.
-You know how, like,

11:21.833 --> 11:24.200
one decision affects, like,
the rest of your life?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.300
If Joe made a couple
of different decisions,

11:26.300 --> 11:27.700
this could
very well be him.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.067
Yeah, this is pretty much --
This is me without the TV show.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.900
You look kind of sexy.
It's coming together.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.933
-Mahalo.
-It's "aloha," you idiot.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.667
"Mahalo" is Hawaiian
for "thank you."

11:37.667 --> 11:39.200
Nice one today
out there, right?

11:39.200 --> 11:41.133
I had a chance to get
in earlier, before, yeah.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.233
Yeah,
I've been working, so --

11:42.233 --> 11:43.600
You know, me and my buddy
are working.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.067
I got to -- I got to pass him
a message, though.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.333
Do you mind if you tell him
something for me?

11:46.333 --> 11:47.867
I'm not allowed
to leave my station.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.967
"Could you ask him if it's cool
if I bring a plus"

11:49.967 --> 11:51.700
Could you just let him --
ask him for me if it's cool

11:51.700 --> 11:54.300
if I bring a plus-one
to the party tonight?

11:54.300 --> 11:56.933
-"It's the Wayne Gretzky."
-It's Wayne Gretzky.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.433
You know what I mean?
So, just --

11:58.433 --> 12:00.533
Just let him know,
"Can I bring a plus"

12:00.533 --> 12:02.800
Okay.
It's Wayne Gretzky.
Wayne Gretzky.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.933
-Here he goes.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.500
Murr: All right, Sal,
now you got to send this guy

12:06.500 --> 12:08.733
back to Joe
with a message.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.933
To the party?

12:12.933 --> 12:15.133
Uh...

12:15.133 --> 12:17.467
Is it

12:17.467 --> 12:19.067
That guy can't come.
That guy is an animal.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.900
Last time he invited him,
he wrecked the whole place.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.600
Everything is a hockey puck,
all of a sudden.

12:23.933 --> 12:26.467
You want to come to the party?
It's a big luau we're having.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.367
It's tonight.
Yeah, it's free.

12:28.367 --> 12:31.833
Tell him to take the plus-one,
put your name on the list.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.167
-Wow.
-A masterful move.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.067
Hey, bud.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.067
Is it 'cause of
the hockey

12:42.667 --> 12:44.633
You Great.
You know the details?

12:44.633 --> 12:46.067
He told you. It's at
the Kahala Resort tonight,

12:46.067 --> 12:48.433
8:00 to 12:00 p.m., open bar,
but all you got to do

12:48.433 --> 12:51.900
is got to give him your name
to put on the list.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.933
No, I got the details.
He gets the name.

12:53.933 --> 12:55.900
So just give him your
contact info, and you can come.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.167
All right,
we'll see you tonight. Mahalo.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.567
Sal, he is coming back.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.833
I hate at his guy.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.867
**

13:09.300 --> 13:11.300
Yeah, I -- I do the --
What -- What's your --

13:11.300 --> 13:13.767
Just put your name, and
if you want to bring a
plus-one, I can put you on.

13:13.767 --> 13:16.233
First name is Greg --
G-R-E-G.
Got it.

13:16.233 --> 13:18.633
This guy is in.
He's coming to a party tonight.
Q: Yeah.

13:18.633 --> 13:19.967
Here, give him this.
This is for --

13:19.967 --> 13:21.667
Tell him this is
to reserve your spot.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.433
Murr: Uh-oh.
And that's it, you're done.
See you tonight.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.367
-Uh-oh.

13:25.767 --> 13:26.867
Tell him
that's to reserve your spot.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.933
Your name's on the list.
Yeah, Greg S.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.800
I got you plus one.
Just give him the $20.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.567
You got it.

13:33.567 --> 13:36.200
-Wow.
-Well done, Sal.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.133
Now he's got something he has
to deliver, not just a message.

13:38.133 --> 13:39.233
Yeah, I hope he just
takes that $20

13:39.233 --> 13:41.067
and walks off
into the sunset.

13:41.067 --> 13:43.100
Whew.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.267
Oh, great.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.167
Oh, this is the $10 party.
He gave you the $20?

13:46.167 --> 13:48.333
Yeah, it's a $10 party.
He's got to give you the $10.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.833
Q: Oh!
There's no way
he's gonna come back.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.100
I can take that.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.633
If you want, yeah. Just tell him
to give you the $10.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.733
-But Joe has kept Sal's $20.
-Yeah.

13:57.733 --> 14:00.100
$10 -- Tell him
it's a $10 party tonight.

14:00.100 --> 14:04.633
-Sal, he is coming back.

14:04.633 --> 14:06.633
Boys, I got
one thing to say.

14:06.633 --> 14:07.933
Mahalo.

14:07.933 --> 14:10.600
Let me guess. He wants --
He said it's $10 party?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.333
He didn't give you the $20
to give back to me.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.400
That son of a bitch. He's got
to give me the $20 back.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.900
Just tell him he's got to
give me the $20 back, though.

14:20.233 --> 14:22.067
As long as he
doesn't keep my $20.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.400
Thanks, Greg. Mahalo.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.767
Murr:
He is coming back.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.167
Yeah, trade
the $10 for the $20.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.800
Oh, yeah, okay.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.633
-Oh, Joe.
-Joe, you're gonna lose.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.800
If you want to tell him
that's your plan, that's
fine 'cause it's his money.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.433
Just walk by and tell him,
"Thanks for the 30 bucks,
sucka," and keep walking,

14:43.433 --> 14:45.667
and you're all set.
-Oh!

14:45.667 --> 14:47.300
You walk by, "Thanks for
the 30 bucks, sucka,"

14:47.300 --> 14:48.933
and don't even break stride.
You just go.

14:50.267 --> 14:52.200
You get to come
to the party, as well.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.367
Mahalo, man.
You know, do it.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.200
I can't get enough
of Joe saying "mahalo."

14:59.433 --> 15:01.233
Here we go, Sal.
-Here he comes.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.333
Here he comes, Sal.

15:11.433 --> 15:14.467
Greg.

15:14.467 --> 15:16.700
Boys, that's how you do it.
Mahalo.

15:19.533 --> 15:22.067
Beach-chair rentals.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.767
All right, Q.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.233
Nice abs, bro.

15:27.233 --> 15:29.333
Yeah!
Mahalo.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.633
Are you headed that way?

15:32.633 --> 15:34.900
Could you give a message
to my friend in the blue shirt?

15:34.900 --> 15:36.167
Could you just tell him,
um...

15:36.167 --> 15:38.233
"How'd it go with
Fat Lenny last night?"

15:38.233 --> 15:40.100
I wasn't there. How'd it go
with Fat Lenny last night?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.533
Okay.

15:41.533 --> 15:44.800
Overall, overall.
Thank you.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.267
Joe: Here you go.
Surf's up, Murr.

15:47.267 --> 15:48.633
Hello?

15:48.633 --> 15:50.433
Yeah. Hey, you know
I can't talk right now.

15:50.433 --> 15:52.367
Murray, Murray,
hang up your phone, you cheater.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.200
Every time you send
someone my way,

15:56.200 --> 15:57.667
every time,
I'm gonna do that now.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.167
-I'm gonna do that now, buddy.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.100
Sal: Guys, guys, maloha.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.533
Hang loose, everyone.
We're in Hawaii.

16:02.533 --> 16:06.600
Aloha,
macadamia nuts, Don Ho.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.133
Excuse me.
Do you mind --

16:08.133 --> 16:09.467
Just tell him it's turn
to wear the lei.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.067
Could you hand this
to the guy down there.

16:11.067 --> 16:14.567
It's his turn to wear the lei.
The ferrety-looking bald guy.

16:14.567 --> 16:17.167
It's -- It's his turn to wear
the lei.
The lei? Okay.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.067
Thank you, brother. Appreciate
that. Thank you very much.

16:19.067 --> 16:19.867
Joe:
They're in, they're in.

16:19.867 --> 16:24.067
**

16:24.067 --> 16:25.600
Hey.
Hey, guys,
you want a beach chair?

16:27.567 --> 16:29.633
Oh. Oh, oh, from my buddy.
-Yeah, right down there.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.967
Our boss is across the street.
He watches like a hawk.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.567
Can you do me a favor?
Give him his water back.

16:33.567 --> 16:34.933
Tell him I don't need that many.
Thank you so much.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.467
I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.

16:37.633 --> 16:38.733
Beach-chair rentals!

16:38.733 --> 16:39.633
Yeah, it's his water.
I borrowed it from him.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.600
Thanks, guys.
Beach-chair rentals!

16:44.067 --> 16:46.500
Joe: Well, your water
is coming back.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.567
Oh!

16:48.567 --> 16:50.900
Oh, you know what?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.900
I left it over there.
You know what, actually?

16:52.900 --> 16:56.100
This is his. Could you --
Could you go give that to him?

16:56.100 --> 16:58.267
Thanks so much.
You know, what happened is,

16:58.267 --> 17:00.067
he went out surfing
last night,

17:00.067 --> 17:02.067
and he hit a dolphin
right in the blowhole.

17:02.067 --> 17:03.233
I don't want to get into this.
It's a whole thing with --

17:03.233 --> 17:04.433
Anyway, that's his.
Could you just --

17:04.433 --> 17:05.667
I'll take the water,
you give that back to him.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.500
Oh, okay, yeah. Boogie board?
Yeah, I got you.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks, buddy. That's his.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.900
Sal: There is
a sense of responsibility

17:11.900 --> 17:13.667
when you're handed
a personal effect.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.100
Joe: The girls have given up on
this guy. He's by himself now.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.700
Hey, man. You want
a beach chair?

17:17.700 --> 17:19.200
You want to rent a beach chair?

17:20.367 --> 17:24.067
Why?

17:24.067 --> 17:26.400
We were surfing last night.
You ever do night surfing?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.100
-Uh, I don't think --
-Dude, it is so much fun.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.767
Murray is trying
to build a relationship.

17:29.767 --> 17:32.500
Yep, he's laying bricks
in his bull house.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.733
You know what?
Do me a favor.

17:33.733 --> 17:35.333
Bring the, uh --
Bring this to that guy.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.400
Tell him he needs it
more than I do.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.267
His buddy's coming over.
Thanks, man.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.500
Thanks.
Thank you, buddy.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.300
Sal:
Aww, this guy is so nice.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.300
Look at --
-Aww, Q.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.400
Aloha.
Surfboard rental.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.767
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.133
No, you didn't put
your fingerprints on that.

17:51.133 --> 17:54.300
No, no, no, dude,
dude, dude, dude.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.233
"The cops are looking
for the guy with this

17:56.233 --> 17:59.067
'cause of the blowhole
incident last night.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.133
Take -- Take this
one back to him.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.967
Don't worry,
I'll hide this one.

18:01.967 --> 18:03.233
-Okay.
-Tell him you're not gonna fall

18:03.233 --> 18:05.533
for his blowhole shenanigans.
Thank you.

18:05.533 --> 18:08.200
No blowhole shenanigans.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.133
Joe: This guy is just a moving
company at this point.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.367
He's giving it back?
Really?

18:15.633 --> 18:16.800
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.233
Do me a favor.
The sun is coming out,

18:18.233 --> 18:19.867
and he's in
the sunny spot, not me.

18:19.867 --> 18:21.400
Sir, could you give us
a quick hand,

18:21.400 --> 18:22.633
just real quick?
Thank you.

18:22.633 --> 18:23.900
We just got to move it
right there.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.500
Thank you. Here, sir,
you come over here.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.133
Come over here, come over here.
Lift up from here.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.067
We just got to move it
to that guy there. Thank you.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.433
Joe: Q, he's sending
over the whole awning.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.067
Bring it to him,
bring it to him.

18:34.433 --> 18:38.767
Sal: Look at -- Here he comes.
Here he comes. Look.

18:38.767 --> 18:40.067
No, no, no, no,
wrong place.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.667
This one goes back.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.500
This goes back.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.700
No, no,
this goes over there.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.133
Oh, man.
-Oh, Q.

18:49.133 --> 18:50.600
Well,
you're in a bad position,

18:50.600 --> 18:53.300
'cause you got to get that
back there by yourself now.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.267
Get it over there.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.900
Now -- Now -- Go.
Don't even worry about it.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.100
There you go.
Straight up like that.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.867
There you go, like that.
-Oh! Oh, he got him!

19:01.867 --> 19:03.200
And don't come
around here again.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.667
-Oh, there you go.
-Unh-unh. Unh-unh, no.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.133
Turn it right around.

19:12.133 --> 19:13.667
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Turn it around.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.067
Turn it right around.
I don't want it.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.633
Son of a bitch.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.233
-Blowhole!
-That's unbelievable.

19:19.233 --> 19:20.800
I cannot believe how much
work that guy put in.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.533
Son of a...

19:25.067 --> 19:26.367
Sal: Good job, Q.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.100
Narrator: This was no day
at the beach for Murr and Sal,

19:29.100 --> 19:32.067
so they're back
on the loser board.

19:32.067 --> 19:34.133
Today we're at the beautiful
Waimea Falls,

19:34.133 --> 19:36.233
and we've got to ask
strangers for advice

19:36.233 --> 19:37.567
on our marriage proposal.

19:37.567 --> 19:38.867
Except the crazy proposal

19:38.867 --> 19:40.067
has been written
by the other guys.

19:40.067 --> 19:41.400
The goal is to get
the stranger

19:41.400 --> 19:43.600
to agree the proposal
is ready to go.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.333
If they say that the proposal
is not ready, you lose.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.867
And you're not
getting married.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.233
Q, you proposed
under a boardwalk, right?

19:55.233 --> 19:57.367
I did. I was engaged
a long time ago.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.200
-He hid the ring in garbage.
-Yeah.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.667
Should have went
for the bread roll.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.067
The bread roll works
one out of one time --

20:03.067 --> 20:04.233
100% success rate.

20:04.233 --> 20:07.367
Garbage, bread roll,
single, single.

20:10.633 --> 20:13.067
I, uh -- Proposing.
My girl's on her way up here.

20:13.067 --> 20:16.733
Would you mind it, actually,
if I ran the proposal by you?

20:16.733 --> 20:18.500
-Okay.
-Here we go.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.733
I wrote it down 'cause I'm --
I'm so bad at this.

20:20.733 --> 20:21.367
I'm so nervous.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.467
I wrote it down 'cause I'm --
I'm so bad at this.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.500
I'm getting killed
on taxes."

20:28.133 --> 20:30.533
"The cost of living is surging
more than a decent wage,

20:30.533 --> 20:33.167
and pretty soon,
there will be no middle class.

20:33.167 --> 20:36.200
I don't know about you, uh,
but I'm not gonna sit around

20:36.200 --> 20:38.433
and take up the --
up the ass."

20:38.433 --> 20:40.867
"Do you -- Do you want
to get married

20:40.867 --> 20:43.533
and save like 10%
and learn to love each other?

20:43.533 --> 20:46.433
People like Indians
do it all the time."

20:48.733 --> 20:51.200
-Oh.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.300
-I think you got a winner there.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.233
I'm so nervous,
I'm so nervous.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.833
"Will you marry me?"

21:01.833 --> 21:06.167
"Will you --
Will you marry me?"

21:06.167 --> 21:07.233
My girlfriend's showing up
in a few minutes.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.667
I'm gonna propose.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.600
I know! I'm so excited!

21:10.600 --> 21:12.533
She -- I -- She's --
Joe: All right, here we go,
here we go.

21:12.533 --> 21:14.900
She's up the parking lot.
She's coming up right now.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.667
Do you mind?
Can I practice my speech?

21:16.667 --> 21:18.067
Can I run it by you real quick?
-Okay, I guess.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.133
-Oh, would --
-Here we go. Murray is in.

21:20.133 --> 21:22.333
Hi.
Q: Look, yes,
the little girl came over.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.600
Do you want to hear
my speech, too?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.067
-Sure.
-Okay, here we go.

21:28.067 --> 21:31.267
"My little dookie fruit,
surprise.

21:31.267 --> 21:34.167
The day has come that we always
talked about -- me and you.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.200
I'm going to treat you
better than your ex did."

21:38.733 --> 21:41.600
"I will never kick rocks at you
or make fun of your neck."

21:41.600 --> 21:42.867
Q: My God!

21:42.867 --> 21:44.467
"I will never tell you
that you're bipolar

21:44.467 --> 21:47.567
or a sewer dweller."

21:47.567 --> 21:50.067
"The only 'C' word to come
out of my mouth is 'cuddle.'"

21:50.067 --> 21:51.367
'Cause I want
to cuddle with her.

21:51.367 --> 21:54.800
"I will tell you you're
beautiful every single day

21:54.800 --> 21:56.567
and not bring up
the stuff that he did,

21:56.567 --> 22:00.567
like your kneecaps,
your elbows, your nostrils."

22:00.567 --> 22:02.067
"I can't wait to wake you up

22:02.067 --> 22:05.267
every morning
with our good-morning song,

22:05.267 --> 22:08.400
'Dookie, dookie, dookie,
my little dookie fruit,

22:08.400 --> 22:12.833
dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
I made you out of clay."

22:14.800 --> 22:16.533
"Do you want to do this,
my little dookie fruit?"

22:16.533 --> 22:18.967
Did you think
the speech is ready?

22:18.967 --> 22:21.233
No? No.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.867
Of course not.

22:22.867 --> 22:24.867
One day, your prince
will come, too.

22:28.433 --> 22:30.367
I'm nervous.

22:31.867 --> 22:34.500
I'm gonna try, yeah.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.767
I prepared something.
Can I run it by you?

22:37.767 --> 22:39.100
Here we go.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.233
-All right.
-You're okay.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.767
"Svetlana...

22:43.767 --> 22:46.233
let's just say
you're the best thing

22:46.233 --> 22:48.600
I ever added to my cart
on the Internet.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.800
I normally have
buyer's remorse,

22:50.800 --> 22:52.700
and honestly,
at first, I did."

22:55.533 --> 22:58.233
"We talked about how
your pictures on wifebuyer.net

22:58.233 --> 23:01.067
weren't the best
representation of you,

23:01.067 --> 23:03.467
but we got past that."

23:03.467 --> 23:06.300
"While I know the fears
I had about saving money

23:06.300 --> 23:12.167
by browsing the over-60
section of wifebuyer.net,

23:12.167 --> 23:15.067
I promise your life here
will be better than Uzbekistan."

23:15.067 --> 23:17.300
"Not that
it'll be too hard,

23:17.300 --> 23:18.867
considering you used
to eat dog."

23:21.633 --> 23:23.800
"You used to eat dog."

23:23.800 --> 23:25.067
"I -- I'd go to the ends
of the Earth

23:25.067 --> 23:27.233
to be with you,
except for Uzbekistan,

23:27.233 --> 23:29.200
'cause of all
the ghastly stories you told me

23:29.200 --> 23:31.367
about your horrid life
before I bought you."

23:32.800 --> 23:35.167
"Please make me the happiest
sewage-removal technician

23:35.167 --> 23:36.500
in all of Scranton,
Pennsylvania,

23:36.500 --> 23:39.433
and say 'da,'
my little Chernobyl."

23:39.433 --> 23:40.800
-Aww.
-Yeah.

23:41.933 --> 23:43.400
So, this is --
You think it's ready?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.167
Thank you so much,
man.

23:45.167 --> 23:47.167
All: Aww!

23:47.167 --> 23:48.267
Joe:
All right, Sal!

23:48.267 --> 23:51.867
**

23:53.333 --> 23:55.100
-Beautiful here.
-Yeah.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.933
It's the right place to do it.
You know what I'm saying?

23:56.933 --> 23:58.167
Yeah.
It's the right place
to do it, but I'm getting...

23:58.167 --> 23:59.233
-Oh, whoa.
-Yeah.

23:59.233 --> 24:00.700
-Well, congratulations.
-Thank you.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.167
Do you mind if I --
I'm gonna practice the speech.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.167
You mind
if I just...

24:04.867 --> 24:06.800
Here we go.
Ready?

24:06.800 --> 24:08.867
"Juicy,
hear me out, please.

24:08.867 --> 24:10.133
No need
to call for help,

24:10.133 --> 24:11.933
as I will be gone
from your life for good,

24:11.933 --> 24:13.800
pending your answer
to this question.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.433
I saw on Facebook that
you were vacationing in Hawaii

24:16.433 --> 24:17.867
with that meathead
of yours,

24:17.867 --> 24:20.067
and I hopped on
an economy..."

24:21.700 --> 24:23.433
"And I hopped
on an economy flight

24:23.433 --> 24:24.867
to track you down
to here.

24:24.867 --> 24:27.333
Hear me out.
I love you.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.067
That meathead is just
interested in you

24:29.067 --> 24:31.300
for your tiny waist
and bodacious bottom."

24:32.300 --> 24:34.067
"Hear me out.
If you marry me,

24:34.067 --> 24:35.467
you'll never
be stalked again,

24:35.467 --> 24:37.200
because we'll be
together for all time.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
I'll never let you
out of my sight."

24:41.367 --> 24:43.200
"Hear me out.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.467
I want to die
with you,

24:44.467 --> 24:46.400
or without you
if you send me away.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.833
So I'll either die happy
with you,

24:48.833 --> 24:51.267
or alone, miserable in this
crappy Hawaiian motel room."

24:52.900 --> 24:55.267
"Thanks for listening.
Hear me out. Harry."

24:55.267 --> 24:56.633
I think
it's quite convincing.

24:56.633 --> 24:58.067
It's pretty convincing,
right?

24:58.067 --> 25:00.133
Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, my God!

25:00.133 --> 25:02.700
He's gonna kill himself
in a Hawaiian motel.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.100
-Yeah, all the best.
-Thank you.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.067
Okay.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.567
Narrator:
Murr was unlucky in love,

25:09.567 --> 25:12.200
so he's got a date
with the loser board.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.633
**

25:14.633 --> 25:17.067
Today, we're at
the beautiful Kualoa Ranch,

25:17.067 --> 25:18.667
teaming up to give
a presentation

25:18.667 --> 25:19.933
on Hawaiian culture.

25:19.933 --> 25:21.833
While teaching the class,
we're gonna have to do

25:21.833 --> 25:23.067
and say whatever
the other guys tell us to.

25:23.067 --> 25:25.500
At the end, we'll ask them,
by show of hands,

25:25.500 --> 25:26.767
if they've learned
anything of value.

25:26.767 --> 25:29.067
Whoever gets the fewest
hands raised loses.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.233
What does that mean?

25:34.233 --> 25:36.400
"Best of luck."

25:36.400 --> 25:38.433
Wait a second.

25:42.467 --> 25:44.400
Joe:
There they are.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.800
Murr:
Here they come.

25:45.800 --> 25:49.067
We dressed Q as a native,
and we dressed Sal --

25:49.067 --> 25:50.667
-As modern Hawaii.
-Yeah.

25:50.667 --> 25:53.433
Hey, everyone,
how are you today?

25:53.433 --> 25:54.933
"Aloha, honkies."

25:54.933 --> 25:56.833
Well, aloha, honkies.

25:57.833 --> 25:59.467
Sal: Today,
we're gonna give you

25:59.467 --> 26:01.533
a little bit of
a history of Hawaii.

26:01.533 --> 26:04.233
Guys, I want you to fade out
your audio as you speak.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.567
First and foremost, we're gonna
start with the history.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.900
And what Q's gonna do

26:08.900 --> 26:10.133
is he's gonna
take you guys through a...

26:12.333 --> 26:14.400
...modern-day stuff
today.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.300
In the beginning,
there were volcanoes!

26:17.300 --> 26:20.533
And then the volcanoes
kept spewing lava and lava,

26:20.533 --> 26:22.333
and the lava
kept coming out and out.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.867
"So, I'm gonna show you
a rain dance

26:25.867 --> 26:27.267
that came back
from the day."

26:27.267 --> 26:29.700
For all the foliage around here
relies on a lot of rain,

26:29.700 --> 26:32.567
and sometimes the winds
just don't blow the rain in.

26:32.567 --> 26:34.767
So they would do
a rain dance.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.300
Try to incorporate
as many middle fingers

26:36.300 --> 26:37.333
as you can
into the rain dance.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.733
All right, okay,
here we go.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.567
Hoo!

26:41.567 --> 26:43.800
Murr:
He's just gonna...

26:43.800 --> 26:45.667
Ahh.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.900
Ahh. Hoo!

26:47.900 --> 26:49.767
There's so many
middle fingers...
Hoo!

26:49.767 --> 26:52.433
-...in this native...
-Hoo-ah!

26:52.433 --> 26:55.500
Sal's trying
not to laugh.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.167
Rain!

26:57.167 --> 26:59.567
Hoo-hah!

26:59.567 --> 27:01.333
Rain!

27:01.333 --> 27:02.967
The ending is
a two-person rain dance.

27:02.967 --> 27:04.167
Okay, ready?

27:04.167 --> 27:05.933
Both:
Hoo! Hahh!

27:05.933 --> 27:08.233
Hoo-hahh!

27:08.233 --> 27:12.200
"F" you, dry skies!
Hoo-hah!

27:14.067 --> 27:15.567
"Let's talk coconuts."

27:15.567 --> 27:17.500
All right, who wants
to talk coconuts?

27:17.500 --> 27:18.533
Huh?!

27:18.533 --> 27:20.467
"We are going to
open a coconut."

27:20.467 --> 27:22.400
We're gonna open
a coconut today for you.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.800
"By using a machete."

27:24.800 --> 27:26.600
Honestly, just try
to open a coconut.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.767
Sal:
There should be a --

27:27.767 --> 27:30.067
Q: Oh, there's a machete
right here.

27:30.067 --> 27:31.967
Oh, I got this.
-Uh, normally,

27:31.967 --> 27:35.500
one easy swipe from a machete
or a break on the rock,

27:35.500 --> 27:38.333
uh, is gonna break open
a coconut right in half.

27:38.333 --> 27:41.100
Um, you're not gonna want to
eat this coconut at this time.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.967
Murr:
Oh, my God!

27:42.967 --> 27:46.800
He -- He -- He still hasn't
opened the coconut.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.933
-It's not ripe.
-I got it.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.100
You -- You should have took
a ripe one.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.967
Q, just throw the coconut
into the jungle.

27:59.267 --> 28:00.733
Trust me,
that thing's open.

28:02.067 --> 28:04.067
All right, so,
how many of you feel

28:04.067 --> 28:05.733
that you may have learned
something of value here today,

28:05.733 --> 28:06.833
by show of hands,
please?

28:06.833 --> 28:09.533
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

28:09.533 --> 28:11.067
Come on!
Everybody?

28:11.067 --> 28:12.867
Thank you so much.

28:14.233 --> 28:16.833
Q: Oh, my God,
look at these two.

28:16.833 --> 28:18.500
Joe: Aloha.
Welcome to Hawaii.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.767
This is where we're gonna
teach you a little bit

28:19.767 --> 28:20.933
about Hawaiian culture.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.500
I teach tradition
and culture of Hawaii.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.067
-Yeah.
-Joseph takes us through...

28:24.067 --> 28:25.700
-The other stuff.
-All the other stuff.

28:27.533 --> 28:29.533
Joe, tell them that
you're the big kahuna

28:29.533 --> 28:31.467
and Murray is
your sweet little coconut.

28:31.467 --> 28:32.967
Uh, our dynamic is,
I'm the big kahuna,

28:32.967 --> 28:34.433
this is my
sweet little coconut.

28:34.433 --> 28:35.767
So, we got a lot
of Hawaiian stuff

28:35.767 --> 28:37.067
I'm gonna take you
through, here.

28:37.067 --> 28:39.400
"There's a lot of birds
indigenous to Hawaii."

28:39.400 --> 28:41.200
There's a lot of birds that
are indigenous just to Hawaii.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.467
Sal: We're gonna take turns
naming birds.

28:43.467 --> 28:45.733
Uh, we'll take turns
naming birds...

28:45.733 --> 28:46.900
"And doing their calls."

28:46.900 --> 28:48.267
-...and doing their call, yeah.
-Hmm, yes.

28:48.267 --> 28:50.633
-Yeah, doing their calls.
-So, go ahead, guys,

28:50.633 --> 28:52.400
name some birds
and do some calls.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.567
In Hawaii -- You could show them
the, uh, the --

28:54.567 --> 28:57.167
the landbound,
um, ponaleii.

28:57.167 --> 28:58.867
Doesn't fly.
-No, doesn't fly.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.433
Yeah.
But it has
a very unique mating call.

29:01.433 --> 29:03.733
It goes,

29:05.433 --> 29:07.500
It's that high-pitched
screech sound.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.833
It's almost annoying,
but also, at the same time,

29:09.833 --> 29:11.767
it's romantic.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.400
Murr:
Why don't you show them

29:13.400 --> 29:15.300
the, uh,
the sand-walking piki bird.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.800
Ah, yes, the sand-walking
piki bird is very interesting.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.667
It's a deep gurgle,
if you will.

29:19.667 --> 29:23.500
It's more like,
"Hawk! Hawka-hawk!"

29:24.767 --> 29:28.233
"Boogah!"

29:28.233 --> 29:32.633
"Hoogah! Hoogah!
Hawk."

29:32.633 --> 29:34.100
That was identical.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.167
Murr, climb a tree.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.800
What?

29:39.800 --> 29:41.533
-Here's...
-Okay.

29:41.533 --> 29:43.633
Uh, this is
a good tree to get up.

29:43.633 --> 29:45.467
Sal: "While James
climbs the tree,

29:45.467 --> 29:48.333
I will demonstrate
some Hawaiian war cries."

29:48.333 --> 29:49.900
Joe: So, while James
climbs the trees,

29:49.900 --> 29:51.733
I will just demonstrate
some more Hawaiian things.

29:51.733 --> 29:54.200
You know, there's some --
some war cries.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.967
Same as the bird.

29:55.967 --> 29:59.833
You know, it's like, "Hoo-ah!"

29:59.833 --> 30:01.733
"Hoo-ah! Hoo-ah!

30:01.733 --> 30:03.467
Koo! Hoo-ah!"

30:03.467 --> 30:05.667
That was a war cry.

30:05.667 --> 30:08.433
Don't confuse it
with the bird mating call.

30:08.433 --> 30:09.933
Bird mating call --
"Hoo-ah!"

30:09.933 --> 30:11.767
War cry -- "Hoo-ah!"

30:12.933 --> 30:14.967
Oh, grab
that palm frond.

30:14.967 --> 30:16.367
Where is the, uh --

30:16.367 --> 30:17.900
Do you guys know
what a palm frond is?

30:17.900 --> 30:19.533
This is a palm frond.

30:19.533 --> 30:22.067
Give it to
the littlest kid there.

30:22.067 --> 30:24.400
So, I'm gonna need
a volunteer.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.500
Yeah, come on up.
Every afternoon, we have --

30:26.500 --> 30:29.533
a chief comes in
and he blesses a palm frond,

30:29.533 --> 30:31.200
and this is for you
to take home.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.900
"It's sacred.
Please don't disrespect it."

30:32.900 --> 30:34.567
It's sacred.
Please don't disrespect it.

30:34.567 --> 30:35.733
Don't let it touch the ground.

30:35.733 --> 30:38.167
Murr: The palm frond
is sacred!

30:39.200 --> 30:41.233
The palm frond
is sacred!

30:41.233 --> 30:43.033
The palm frond
is sacred!

30:43.033 --> 30:44.100
What did he say?

30:47.533 --> 30:48.733
Right. Very good.

30:48.733 --> 30:50.967
Joe, can you
throw Murr a ukulele up there?

30:50.967 --> 30:53.233
You know what?
Let me get you the ukulele.

30:53.233 --> 30:54.500
I mean, if you're gonna
be stuck up there,

30:54.500 --> 30:56.467
the least you can do
is the ukulele presentation.

30:56.467 --> 30:58.033
**

30:58.033 --> 30:59.900
Ow. You

31:02.433 --> 31:03.933
Yep.

31:03.933 --> 31:06.667
You know, music is a big part
of the culture here in Hawaii.

31:06.667 --> 31:09.900
So he's gonna do --
He's on uke, I'm on drums.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.733
"Now, 'ukulele'
is Hawaiian..."

31:11.733 --> 31:13.200
Now, "ukulele" is Hawaiian...

31:13.200 --> 31:15.633
"...for gay guitar."

31:15.633 --> 31:17.867
Say it, say it!

31:17.867 --> 31:19.633
...for "gay guitar."

31:22.200 --> 31:23.600
A happy guitar --
a little happy one.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.667
Yes, you have a question?

31:25.667 --> 31:27.567
You have a ukulele?
Oh, you play the gay guitar.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.433
Q: All right, Joe, pick up
that drum and join him.

31:32.433 --> 31:35.167
Jam out, you two,
Hawaiian-style.

31:49.667 --> 31:51.067
Joe, start getting aggressive.

31:54.233 --> 31:56.933
Joe, start -- start getting
really hard with it.

31:56.933 --> 31:59.533
Really hard and intense.
Start doing the war cry.

31:59.533 --> 32:02.300
Dak-dah!

32:03.633 --> 32:05.300
Dak-dah!

32:07.700 --> 32:09.967
You look insane!
You look insane!

32:09.967 --> 32:11.667
Dak-dah!

32:11.667 --> 32:13.400
Dak-dah!

32:13.400 --> 32:15.067
Dak-dah!

32:15.067 --> 32:17.667
Hak-dah! Hak-dah!

32:17.667 --> 32:19.833
Hak-dah!

32:19.833 --> 32:21.933
Hak-dah!

32:23.433 --> 32:24.767
Thank you.

32:24.767 --> 32:26.967
Joe, throw a pineapple
at Murray, up in the tree.

32:26.967 --> 32:29.533
Just throw a pineapple
up at Murray.

32:29.533 --> 32:32.700
Oh

32:32.700 --> 32:34.067
Aah!

32:34.067 --> 32:35.733
You

32:35.733 --> 32:37.467
Ow!

32:37.467 --> 32:39.067
He almost knocked me
out of the tree!

32:39.067 --> 32:40.500
Ow!

32:40.500 --> 32:41.867
You all right,
little coconut?

32:41.867 --> 32:43.667
-I'm good, big kahuna.
-Okay.

32:43.667 --> 32:45.800
Out of everybody that
was here today, raise your hand

32:45.800 --> 32:48.367
if you feel like you learned
something of value.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.500
Q: Nobody?

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
Narrator: Murr and Joe
are in culture shock

32:55.500 --> 33:00.300
as they find themselves
on the loser board.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.500
Today we're working
at the beautiful Waikiki Beach,

33:02.500 --> 33:03.733
and we just
went on break.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.900
We'll have to find a way
to lay on someone's towel,

33:05.900 --> 33:08.600
invade their personal space,
and not get kicked off.

33:08.600 --> 33:12.267
We are gonna be unwanted,
uninvited, and uncomfortable.

33:12.267 --> 33:14.567
If they ask you to leave,
you lose.

33:14.567 --> 33:15.800
Stupid.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.567
Should we just leave him there
for the whole thing?

33:17.567 --> 33:18.933
Huh?
We should
just leave him there.

33:18.933 --> 33:20.567
We should.
Can we just
leave him there all day?

33:20.567 --> 33:22.533
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

33:22.533 --> 33:27.267
**

33:27.267 --> 33:28.567
What's up, buddy?

33:28.567 --> 33:30.733
You're getting
a little red.

33:30.733 --> 33:31.867
Yeah, I know.

33:33.633 --> 33:35.400
Is that it?
That's it?

33:35.400 --> 33:37.233
I got to
go do this.

33:39.767 --> 33:43.700
**

33:43.700 --> 33:44.700
Aaah!

33:44.700 --> 33:46.933
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

33:46.933 --> 33:48.567
Oh, my God.

33:48.567 --> 33:50.233
It just scared
the hell out of me.

33:50.233 --> 33:51.667
Here we go.

33:51.667 --> 33:52.833
Q:
All right, Gatto.

33:52.833 --> 33:55.067
Joe: All right,
there's a spot right here.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.733
What's up, guys?

33:56.733 --> 33:58.600
I'm gonna
conk out real quick.

33:59.633 --> 34:02.100
I'm just gonna
conk out real quick.

34:06.300 --> 34:08.067
He just took over
their towel.

34:08.067 --> 34:10.300
What are you doing,
a guy like this?

34:11.400 --> 34:14.633
It's better
the other way, actually.

34:14.633 --> 34:15.800
She's not saying
a damn word.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.267
Not saying a word.

34:17.267 --> 34:19.067
You know what?
Other way is better.

34:20.067 --> 34:22.567
Now he's rubbing it
in our face.

34:22.567 --> 34:24.600
This guy is planking.

34:24.600 --> 34:28.300
His face is directly
in the sand like an ostrich.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.600
Planking, bro?

34:32.633 --> 34:34.700
Planks a lot, man,
for letting me chill here.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.600
Tom Planks
in "Cast Away" over here.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.533
"Young Plank-enstein."

34:41.767 --> 34:43.967
Wait, so, not only
has he succeeded

34:43.967 --> 34:45.333
and he got
the towel,

34:45.333 --> 34:47.067
now he's just
roasting people.

34:47.067 --> 34:49.733
-Thanks, guys.
-That's it. That's Joe Gatto.

34:49.733 --> 34:52.200
I don't want
to forget my towels.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.700
-He's taking the towel!
-He's taking the towel!

34:55.800 --> 34:57.267
Oh, oh, oh!

34:57.267 --> 34:59.167
Oh, that's yours.

34:59.167 --> 35:01.100
Oh, okay, here you go.
Got it.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.167
Let's go live
to an update on Murray.

35:06.167 --> 35:08.433
Okay, I'm burning, guys.

35:08.433 --> 35:10.733
Give me a damn hat!
-Oh, my God, that's right,

35:10.733 --> 35:12.433
you don't have
the protection of hair.

35:12.433 --> 35:15.100
**

35:15.100 --> 35:17.367
-Who's -- Aah!
-Aw!

35:17.367 --> 35:19.867
Get off me! Who is that?
Get off me!

35:20.867 --> 35:23.133
Oh, my God,
that was disgusting.

35:23.133 --> 35:24.700
You guys know
what the deal is

35:24.700 --> 35:26.400
with the human egg
over there?

35:26.400 --> 35:28.200
Oh, he's using Murray
as an in.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.100
That's the thing
about these beaches.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.733
Here he goes.

35:37.333 --> 35:40.933
Sal:
Look at that!

35:40.933 --> 35:42.567
His head
is on the blanket.

35:42.567 --> 35:45.067
Hi.

35:45.067 --> 35:46.633
What's going on,
my man?

35:46.633 --> 35:47.867
Mahalo.

35:47.867 --> 35:49.933
-Dude.
-Yeah!

35:49.933 --> 35:51.533
-Oh, that's ballsy, man.
-Thank you.

35:51.533 --> 35:53.867
Thanks.
The three of us. Oh.

35:53.867 --> 35:55.367
Sharing is caring.

35:55.367 --> 35:57.300
Oh, man, you found
the nicest people!

35:57.300 --> 35:59.167
Where are
you guys from?

35:59.167 --> 36:01.200
-That's a win.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.533
What's going on
over here?

36:03.533 --> 36:05.833
Hey, Sal.

36:07.067 --> 36:11.833
-Urhhhhhhh!
-Oh!

36:15.133 --> 36:19.433
You -- Get your
flat feet off me!

36:20.700 --> 36:23.067
I got to go to work, buddy.
Wish me luck, all right?

36:23.067 --> 36:24.500
Good luck.

36:25.833 --> 36:26.933
Sal --

36:26.933 --> 36:28.567
Oh, there we go.
This lady is by herself.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.400
Plenty of room
on that towel.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.400
Whew.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.400
Oahu!

36:35.400 --> 36:37.200
Geez Louise.
It's so nice down here.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.900
-Oh, he's in.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.667
Ahh, that's
the easy part.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.100
-Right.
-Now he's got to stay.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.333
What's that,
dear?

36:45.333 --> 36:46.833
Oh, this is
someone's towel?

36:46.833 --> 36:48.833
Oh, I thought it was
just a spare towel.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.600
-No.
-Oh, okay.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.133
She can
ask you to leave.

36:52.133 --> 36:54.100
Where -- Where do you
get these towels?

36:55.500 --> 36:57.267
-Oh, you brought them with you.
-The hotel.

36:57.267 --> 36:59.533
Oh, I thought maybe they might
have given them to you out here.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.367
She wants him gone.

37:01.367 --> 37:02.900
Yeah.

37:02.900 --> 37:04.433
He's gonna -- All right,
I didn't even see him,

37:04.433 --> 37:06.733
so I didn't even know.
All right, well...

37:06.733 --> 37:08.667
Oh, that's him,
right there. Oh, oh.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.133
Q:
Oh, he spotted Sal.

37:10.133 --> 37:12.267
Oh, he sees somebody
on his turf.

37:12.267 --> 37:14.300
Sal,
where you going?

37:14.300 --> 37:15.700
Hey, Mister, I'm sorry,
I didn't --

37:15.700 --> 37:17.400
I thought there was
an empty seat there.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.067
Just figured --
I thought they put them --

37:20.067 --> 37:21.900
they laid them out
because a public beach.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.567
Oh, my God! She just did
the "crazy" signal.

37:24.567 --> 37:25.667
She did
the hand thing.

37:25.667 --> 37:26.900
Here, do you want
an ice-cold water

37:26.900 --> 37:28.400
or some sunblock
or anything?

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
Q: Oh!

37:29.400 --> 37:32.600
Said, "Get rid of him"!

37:34.133 --> 37:36.800
I could keep it warm
for you, if you need.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.833
-Goodbye, Sal.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.400
Q: That's it.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.200
-All right, Murray, your turn.
!

37:44.200 --> 37:46.233
-You're up, bud.
-You're up.

37:46.233 --> 37:47.767
Uh, I can't.

37:47.767 --> 37:50.700
-All right, you lost.
-Come on!

37:50.700 --> 37:52.733
What time is high tide?

37:53.967 --> 37:55.800
Narrator:
Murr was a total beach bum,

37:55.800 --> 37:59.667
making him tonight's big loser.

37:59.667 --> 38:01.767
-All right!
-All right! We did it.

38:01.767 --> 38:05.400
-Murr is our big Hawaiian loser.
-That's right, baby.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.500
And everybody knows how Murray
is afraid of heights.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.400
Yes, absolutely.
Probably his number-one fear.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.100
-Yes.
-Number-two fear is sharks.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.733
Yes. This is not hap--
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:13.733 --> 38:15.067
This has nothing
to do with sharks.

38:15.067 --> 38:16.667
Uh...
Well, we teamed up

38:16.667 --> 38:18.833
with North Shore
Shark Adventures.

38:18.833 --> 38:21.900
No! No! No!

38:21.900 --> 38:24.167
Murr goes in the cage,
cage goes in the water.

38:24.167 --> 38:25.700
-No!
-Sharks in the water.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.067
-No!
-Our sharks.

38:27.067 --> 38:28.700
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.200
Nobody's ever got hurt
by a shark before.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.700
Yes, they have!
Didn't you see the video

38:31.700 --> 38:33.833
from like two months ago
of the guy in the shark cage,

38:33.833 --> 38:35.267
and the great white
came through the cage?!

38:35.267 --> 38:38.267
Yeah, saw that.
I'm sorry,
I don't watch videos.

38:38.267 --> 38:40.733
Joe: All right, here we are,
buddy, the open waters.

38:40.733 --> 38:43.100
-I don't want to do this.
-You're gonna be fine, Murr.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.700
-You don't know that.
-You're gonna be fine.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.400
-You don't know that.
-Here we go.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.767
Joe:
There it is!

38:47.767 --> 38:49.167
Q: Yeah!

38:49.167 --> 38:51.767
!
-That looks sturdy.

38:51.767 --> 38:52.767
Oh-ho-ho!

38:52.767 --> 38:54.500
Q: That looks
pretty sturdy.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.867
I'm not
getting in there.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.133
all across.

38:58.133 --> 38:59.600
Oh, my God.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.967
Sal: They're right here.
They're literally right here.

39:01.967 --> 39:04.067
-Look at that guy!
-Oh, my God.

39:04.067 --> 39:07.067
We may have
gone too far.

39:07.067 --> 39:08.567
-Oooh. Ooooh.
-I know what you're wondering --

39:08.567 --> 39:10.100
what do you do when you're
in the cage? But don't worry.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.233
We put some fun stuff
at the bottom for you.

39:12.233 --> 39:14.067
I'm not
swimming down.

39:14.067 --> 39:16.133
I'm staying right here,
holding on to the ladder.

39:16.133 --> 39:18.433
No, you don't get out
until you do the thing.

39:18.433 --> 39:20.667
Yeah. Like, you have to go
get your passport

39:20.667 --> 39:22.500
that we put at
the bottom of the cage.

39:23.667 --> 39:26.733
It's down there
in a treasure chest.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.933
Murray...

39:29.933 --> 39:33.600
All:
Murray, Murray, Murray, Murray!

39:33.600 --> 39:37.267
Go ahead, get in there.
I got reservations for dinner.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.333
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.267
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.733
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

39:44.733 --> 39:46.700
There's one right there.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.067
Look at
this brave explorer.

39:51.067 --> 39:53.300
Look at masculinity
in the new century.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.700
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

39:54.700 --> 39:57.867
It says here over 300 people
get bitten by sharks each year.

39:57.867 --> 40:00.067
Shut up!
Shut up, Sal!

40:00.067 --> 40:01.467
Go in the cage.

40:01.467 --> 40:05.433
**

40:05.433 --> 40:07.567
There's no way
I can go in there!

40:07.567 --> 40:09.133
There's sharks everywhere!

40:13.533 --> 40:15.067
Aah! Aah!

40:15.067 --> 40:17.533
**

40:17.533 --> 40:18.767
-Oh, my God!
-Get in the cage.

40:18.767 --> 40:20.000
-Oh, my God!
-Get in the cage.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.467
Aah! Aah!

40:21.467 --> 40:23.433
Get in the cage.

40:23.433 --> 40:27.200
Murr, your passport
down there.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.500
**

40:30.500 --> 40:32.767
It's outside the cage!

40:32.767 --> 40:33.967
Yes, it is.

40:33.967 --> 40:36.267
I'm not gonna --
reaching outside the cage.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.600
If you don't want your passport,
you don't have to get it.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.833
We're in Hawaii.
It's not like...

40:38.833 --> 40:40.000
Don't tell him that.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.033
He didn't realize that
when he brought it.

40:45.133 --> 40:48.667
Murr,
the sooner you start,

40:48.667 --> 40:51.067
the sooner's it's over.
There he goes.

40:51.067 --> 40:53.800
There he goes,
there he goes.

40:57.433 --> 41:00.067
Aah! Aah!

41:00.067 --> 41:01.367
-Oh! Oh! Oh!
! What?!

41:01.367 --> 41:02.967
Oh, my God,
there's like 10 of them!

41:02.967 --> 41:04.367
One, two, three,
four, five...

41:04.367 --> 41:06.300
-Oh, my God, there's so many!
!

41:06.300 --> 41:08.333
There's no less
than 10 sharks right now.

41:08.333 --> 41:12.767
**

41:15.167 --> 41:18.767
**

41:20.067 --> 41:21.767
Nope! Nope! Nope.

41:23.133 --> 41:24.900
Murr, you're gonna need
a bigger scrote.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.267
-Ha ha!
-Nice.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.900
It was a play on words
from a very popular quote

41:29.900 --> 41:31.300
from the movie --
"Jaws."

41:31.300 --> 41:35.100
**

41:39.067 --> 41:43.667
**

41:44.867 --> 41:46.100
What happened?

41:46.100 --> 41:47.300
Oh! Yeah!

41:47.300 --> 41:48.600
Oh, he got
the treasure chest!

41:48.600 --> 41:50.933
-Got the treasure chest.

41:50.933 --> 41:54.067
-No.
! What else do you need?

41:54.067 --> 41:55.633
Joe: All you got to do is
go down and hold the mirror.

41:55.633 --> 41:57.933
**

41:57.933 --> 41:59.100
That attracts sharks.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.167
Sal: Yeah.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.933
Go down there
and just shine that

42:02.933 --> 42:04.633
all over the place
and attract them.

42:08.800 --> 42:13.100
**

42:14.900 --> 42:16.833
Joe: How do we --
how do we make it go away?

42:16.833 --> 42:18.833
What Murr doesn't realize
is we're detaching the cage.

42:18.833 --> 42:22.667
Murr:
Aah! Aah! Aah!

42:22.667 --> 42:25.167
**

42:27.667 --> 42:29.233
Q: He doesn't know.
Murray doesn't know

42:29.233 --> 42:31.067
he's floating away right now.
He still hasn't realized.

42:31.067 --> 42:31.967
Sal: No,
he doesn't know.

42:34.800 --> 42:39.367
Wait! Wait!

42:39.367 --> 42:41.667
Guys!

42:41.667 --> 42:43.733
What the ?!

42:43.733 --> 42:45.667
See you later,
buddy!

42:45.667 --> 42:47.067
Guys, pull it back!

42:47.067 --> 42:48.933
We'll drag you back
three miles!

42:48.933 --> 42:50.667
In the cage!
-Hang 10. Hang 10.

42:50.667 --> 42:52.833
Oh, my God!
Pull me back!

42:52.833 --> 42:55.500
Aah! Aah! Aah!

42:55.500 --> 42:58.533
**

43:01.667 --> 43:03.533
So, Murray just got
shark-attacked in
tonight's punishment,

43:03.533 --> 43:05.733
and you get a behind-the-scenes
look of how it happened

43:05.733 --> 43:08.667
and bonus clips
from this Hawaiian episode.

43:08.667 --> 43:10.300
Check this out.
I'm getting sick.

43:10.300 --> 43:13.367
Murr: I failed miserably
at the Hawaii episode.

43:13.367 --> 43:14.800
Casey: Do you have any
Hawaiian regrets,

43:14.800 --> 43:16.500
as far as the episode goes?
-I wish I won,

43:16.500 --> 43:18.667
but I made
a couple of bad bets.

43:18.667 --> 43:20.433
Mm.
What I thought
would be funny --

43:20.433 --> 43:21.700
if I get buried
in the sand

43:21.700 --> 43:24.900
for the intro
of the beach challenge...

43:24.900 --> 43:28.300
Yeah.
...and that backfired,
you know, badly.

43:28.300 --> 43:30.667
-I am burning, guys.
-Look at his head.

43:30.667 --> 43:31.933
Give me a damn hat.

43:31.933 --> 43:34.200
Sal: Dude,
you look not good.

43:34.200 --> 43:37.533
No
You look like
a Vaseline-dipped testicle.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.533
I'm sweating.
You are sufferin'.

43:40.533 --> 43:41.700
I couldn't get out.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.900
I was vertical,
so I couldn't move.

43:43.900 --> 43:45.400
Yeah, that was...
That was not a wise move.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.700
-Okay, here we go.
-Cut!

43:46.700 --> 43:48.567
All right, bud, we're gonna
borrow him real quick.

43:50.067 --> 43:51.933
So, he's about
to find out.

43:51.933 --> 43:53.900
What do you think
his reaction's gonna be?

43:55.900 --> 43:58.500
What?! No! Doh!

43:58.500 --> 44:00.600
I think
something like that.

44:00.600 --> 44:03.467
That's pretty accurate.
I thought I was talking to Murr.

44:04.533 --> 44:07.067
-All right! We did it!
-All right, Murr!

44:07.067 --> 44:09.933
-The big Hawaiian loser!
-That's right, baby.

44:09.933 --> 44:11.833
And we're gonna have you
meet some sharks.

44:11.833 --> 44:13.333
Murr: No!

44:15.167 --> 44:16.933
In all honesty,
I don't want to do this.

44:16.933 --> 44:18.133
I know.
Yeah, we know you don't.
We know.

44:18.133 --> 44:19.533
-This is not safe.
-We know.

44:19.533 --> 44:21.133
Well,
we're three miles off shore,

44:21.133 --> 44:24.300
so technically any shark...

44:24.300 --> 44:26.600
You know I don't go
in the water past this high,

44:26.600 --> 44:29.767
'cause I'm afraid of sharks.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.100
Wow. Well, today,
you're going in pretty deep.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.900
-Yes, Murr knows.

44:36.900 --> 44:38.533
Oh, okay.
So, he's been
on the boat the whole time,

44:38.533 --> 44:39.900
so he doesn't know
what Murr knows.

44:39.900 --> 44:42.300
As we're diving
in there testing

44:42.300 --> 44:44.367
how to roll on these GoPros,
there's like

44:44.367 --> 44:46.700
14 sharks just like --
they're just very curious,

44:46.700 --> 44:49.200
and they come around any time
a boat comes around.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.067
You've been
lying to Murr all week.

44:51.067 --> 44:52.933
I lie to Murr
every single day of my life.

44:53.933 --> 44:56.433
I like you.
I like working with you.

44:56.433 --> 44:58.600
When he's like, "How did that
bit go"

44:58.600 --> 45:01.300
-"Good."
-Yes. "You were hilarious."

45:02.400 --> 45:04.833
I was gonna say it,
actually!

45:04.833 --> 45:06.867
I did a switch take.
Let's see if they notice.

45:06.867 --> 45:09.200
I have different shorts
from the intro to this.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.567
I didn't think
anybody would notice.

45:10.567 --> 45:11.833
Let's see who noticed.

45:11.833 --> 45:13.967
Wow, that's a fun one.
I actually love that.

45:13.967 --> 45:15.467
'Cause I want to be able
to jump in the water

45:15.467 --> 45:18.500
if I have to
save Murray.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.700
Casey: The water is, like,
really choppy today,

45:20.700 --> 45:23.233
which is, like, not really
helping production at all.

45:23.233 --> 45:24.933
It's actually nerve-wracking.

45:24.933 --> 45:26.433
But it will help

45:26.433 --> 45:28.567
because Murr will be
extra terrified.

45:31.300 --> 45:33.733
Murr:
We need a bigger boat!

45:33.733 --> 45:35.133
If anything
goes wrong...

45:35.133 --> 45:36.633
can I have
your lightsabers?

45:37.733 --> 45:39.733
Yeah,
you bought four.

45:39.733 --> 45:41.300
Joe: I mean, Murray,
you have to get in the water.

45:41.300 --> 45:42.900
-You get in the water, man!

45:42.900 --> 45:44.633
I'll hold your hand.

45:44.633 --> 45:45.833
Sal:
It says here

45:45.833 --> 45:48.833
most attacks happen
within two miles shore.

45:48.833 --> 45:51.667
-We're 1.8 miles off shore.
-It says here

45:51.667 --> 45:54.267
it's especially scary
for huge pussies.

45:55.467 --> 45:56.800
Punishments --

45:56.800 --> 45:59.367
and this is probably the
craziest one we've ever done.

45:59.367 --> 46:00.900
I'm, like, very nervous.

46:00.900 --> 46:03.967
The entire crew is, like,
holding on for our lives.

46:03.967 --> 46:05.967
And I feel the worst for Murr,
of course.

46:05.967 --> 46:07.233
Murray!

46:07.233 --> 46:09.267
**

46:09.267 --> 46:10.433
Blood in the water!

46:10.433 --> 46:11.867
There's blood
in the water, Murray!

46:11.867 --> 46:15.133
Murr:
Sal, that's not funny!

46:15.133 --> 46:17.467
Oh, man, they're gonna
come now, baby!

46:17.467 --> 46:20.400
-Yes!
-Guys, come on!

46:20.400 --> 46:21.867
Murr:

46:21.867 --> 46:23.933
Is that real blood?!

46:23.933 --> 46:27.733
Is that real blood?
-No. No, no.

46:27.733 --> 46:30.100
Murr:
No way! It's not happening!

46:30.100 --> 46:33.067
Well, Murray thought he was
gonna go hang gliding, possibly.

46:33.067 --> 46:35.067
Fake hang gliding things
all over the place.

46:35.067 --> 46:36.267
You told me it was
a double punishment,

46:36.267 --> 46:37.567
that you were tricking him.
-Yeah, I know.

46:37.567 --> 46:40.133
-Yeah.
-Hey!

46:40.133 --> 46:42.833
Also, I was -- like,
full disclosure --

46:42.833 --> 46:44.700
I was nervous up until
the moment we said it,

46:44.700 --> 46:47.500
'cause I didn't know if there
was gonna be a double-cross.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.267
And, like, I'm still afraid
a little bit.

46:49.267 --> 46:50.533
Well...
Well...

46:50.533 --> 46:51.967
Oh...

46:51.967 --> 46:53.967
Don't start
doing that bull--

46:53.967 --> 46:55.500
-Don't start doing that again.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.900
-No, it's not a "well."

46:56.900 --> 46:58.367
No.
And there's
no double

46:58.367 --> 46:59.700
This isn't, like,
a regular thing where like...

46:59.700 --> 47:02.167
-Let's talk wells.
-No. We're in Hawaii.

47:02.167 --> 47:04.267
You lost
the Hawaiian episode.

47:04.267 --> 47:05.600
You're going swimming
with sharks, baby.

47:05.600 --> 47:06.800
-That's it, bud.
-And that's it.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.933
And now
the intro's over, right?

47:08.933 --> 47:11.067
-Yeah, that's it.
-Okay. Oh, my God.

47:11.067 --> 47:12.900
I swear to Christ,
I was so nervous.

47:12.900 --> 47:14.167
Oh, no!
This is not safe.

47:14.167 --> 47:15.867
You're worried about
the cage failing?

47:15.867 --> 47:18.433
Yeah.
Oh, well, good news --
there is no cage.

47:18.433 --> 47:20.700
-So that's good news.

47:20.700 --> 47:21.967
I'm skydiving?
-That's not possible.

47:21.967 --> 47:23.367
There's no cage.

47:23.367 --> 47:25.267
-That's not possible.
-There's no cage.

47:25.267 --> 47:26.800
You're just going
in the water with sharks.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.233
-He is. There's no cage.

47:28.233 --> 47:29.633
-Oh, my God.
-He's just going in the...

47:29.633 --> 47:30.700
I thought you were gonna be
like, "There is no cage"...

47:30.700 --> 47:32.733
-Both: Well...
-No! No!

47:32.733 --> 47:34.800
What?!
Is there a "well" or not?

47:34.800 --> 47:36.467
Sal: Is this a double-cross
or is it not a double

47:36.467 --> 47:37.800
Murr:
What is going on?

47:37.800 --> 47:40.200
You can't do this,
because I'm not punishing.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.100
You can't make me
feel like I'm punished,

47:42.100 --> 47:43.467
'cause that's part
of the punishment.

47:43.467 --> 47:45.233
I got a surprise
for you guys.

47:45.233 --> 47:47.367
And the whole crew knows.
On three, everybody.

47:47.367 --> 47:49.700
Here's what happened.
This is a triple reversal.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.733
One, two, three...
Well...you're all --

47:52.733 --> 47:54.933
No, I-I...
You got nothin'?
That would've been great.

47:54.933 --> 47:57.267
Nothin'.
So this is back
to what I thought.

47:57.267 --> 47:58.733
-Yeah.
-No double-cross.

47:58.733 --> 48:00.133
All right, so now
we have to make our way

48:00.133 --> 48:01.800
to the marina now.

48:03.367 --> 48:05.100
'Oh, thank God
it's over.
