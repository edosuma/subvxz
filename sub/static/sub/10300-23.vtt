01:20.000 --> 01:21.399
We're in trouble.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.194
Daddy's watching Shenandoah.

01:25.240 --> 01:29.153
No, not the one where Jimmy Stewart
beats all odds to preserve his family?

01:29.360 --> 01:33.672
When they crank up the theme song,
Dad's gonna blow like a geyser.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.589
Oh, we're doomed.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.475
He's gonna wanna spend time
with us now.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.678
Come on, kids.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.754
God, that movie makes you think.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.518
Family meeting.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.239
Family, there comes a time
in the life of every man...

02:11.440 --> 02:13.431
Can we just skip
through the speech, Al...

02:13.640 --> 02:18.270
...and get to the punishment that you
will inflict on us for being your family?

02:18.480 --> 02:22.632
What is it this time, honey?
You gonna get out the horseshoe set?

02:22.840 --> 02:25.718
Boys-against-the-girls bocce?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.479
Oh, no, Al...

02:28.680 --> 02:31.717
...not the boo-hoo with you-know-who
at the zoo.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.397
No, Peg, because we're no longer
allowed in the zoo...

02:38.120 --> 02:40.680
...thanks to young Mr. Bundy,
who answered the question:

02:40.880 --> 02:43.474
What happens when you feed
a panda Pop Rocks?

02:45.560 --> 02:48.358
At least I have
a little intellectual curiosity.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.871
I wasn't pointing
at the leopard yelling:

02:51.080 --> 02:53.640
"How many animals died
for that coat?"

02:56.600 --> 03:00.752
Well, at least I didn't pull my pants
down and moon the monkeys.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.428
Well, at least I didn't turn her in.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.553
Well, at least I didn't ask
the girl chimp to my prom.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.399
- Hey, now that was a hot chimp!
- That's sick. That's sick!

03:16.640 --> 03:18.073
Now, kids, hold it. Hey.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.716
Now, I think we're missing
the point of Shenandoah.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.717
Families are meant to be together.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.798
- Well, we don't wanna be together.
- You have no choice.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.949
I dedicate today
as Bundy Sunday Fun Day.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.638
And so it ends.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.711
Now, here's the plan.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.514
We're going to take a Sunday drive.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.437
In the Dodge?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.477
Just for that, you ride in the back seat
with your mother.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.558
Now, anyone else have
any problems with the Dodge?

03:53.120 --> 03:58.274
And I'm not going to tell you now,
but I have a special surprise in mind.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.796
You got a bumper sticker that says
"My Other Car Is My Feet"?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.189
You used your finger to make
a cool racing stripe...

04:06.400 --> 04:09.119
...in the dirt on the side of the car?

04:09.320 --> 04:13.313
You got a new eight-track
of "Hotel California"?

04:13.680 --> 04:17.116
We can crank it as we're towed
down the freeway?

04:17.640 --> 04:20.392
Don't make me kill you
on Family Day.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.359
- I say we all put on our finest clothes...
- We're in them.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.790
...pack ourselves some vittles...
- We have none.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.594
...and pile in the car
for a day of fun...

04:28.800 --> 04:32.713
...a day of family, a day of love.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.797
Sixty-four bottles of beer on the wall
Sixty-four bottles of beer

04:38.000 --> 04:39.115
If one of them bottles...

04:39.320 --> 04:41.117
You stink, Al.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.393
- Why isn't Kelly pushing?
- Drop dead, you little doody.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.558
Shut up, the lot of you.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.159
Now, this is Bundy Sunday Fun Day.
I'll not have you ruin it for me.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.755
Pumpkin, put the car in park, honey.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.032
Oh, I already did that
before you started pushing.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.118
Al, stop it.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.799
All right, all right.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.509
I'm fine.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.468
- AI!
- I wanna kill you for this!

05:08.720 --> 05:10.119
Come on, Al.

05:10.320 --> 05:14.598
Look, when this car ran out of gas, you
promised that if we helped you push...

05:14.800 --> 05:17.792
...you'd let us in on this big surprise
that you have for us.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.468
So, what is it, Al? Tell us.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.750
Are you dying?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.758
No.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.990
But if you were the least bit observant,
you'd see what the surprise is.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.999
Oh, my God.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.555
I see it. I see it.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.910
Oh, Al, can this be true?

05:41.160 --> 05:42.957
Tis.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.317
After years of living like paupers...

05:45.520 --> 05:48.193
...the Bundys are gonna do what
the Rockefellers are doing:

05:48.400 --> 05:52.473
We're gonna get our gas today
from the full-serve pump.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.388
You see?

05:59.600 --> 06:04.549
Oh, Al. I feel like a princess.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.798
Who's the king of surprises?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.753
- Daddy!
- You betcha.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.952
Who wants to be the one to honk
the horn to summon the attendant?

06:15.160 --> 06:17.720
- I do. I wanna do it.
- I do. Come on, Dad, I wanna do it.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.595
All right, now, now,
how does a father choose?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.756
Let the boy do it.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.948
Al, isn't that a little obnoxious?

06:33.200 --> 06:36.590
Peg, we're paying 25 cents extra
for a gallon. He'll take it and like it.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.876
Come on, you rummy. Fully serve us.

06:39.080 --> 06:43.517
- What can I do for you, folks?
- We'll have $2 worth of regular.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.710
Will there be anything else, sir?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.879
Yes, there will be.
Check under the hood.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.674
Peg, look at that.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.151
It's the first time I told somebody
to do something and he's doing it.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.951
Yes, honey. It's also
the first time you've had $2.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.558
You're down 4 quarts of oil.
Want me to put it in?

07:19.800 --> 07:23.270
Hey, how many paychecks
do you think I get in a week, buddy?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.878
No, no, just check something else.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.514
Well, your engine block is cracked...

07:31.720 --> 07:34.359
...and you got a pair of nylons
for a fan belt.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.513
Those are my good black ones.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.116
Hey, what do you wanna do, you wanna
look good walking or look good riding?

07:41.360 --> 07:44.318
Hey, Dad, can I order
the geek around too?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.070
Hey, marry your own.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.075
No, I was talking about
the gas jockey, Dad.

07:55.280 --> 08:01.150
Bud, I said it was Bundy Family Day,
didn't I? Of course you can.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.235
Okay, goober.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.354
Check the tires,
there might be a nickel in it for you.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.711
Son, son, son. I don't have a nickel.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.430
Yeah, you're pretty low, sir.
You want some air?

08:18.680 --> 08:21.433
Oh, no, thanks. We'll just breathe
the stuff that's around.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.071
Oh, Al, you've made this
such a great day for us all.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.157
Yeah, Daddy. Thank you.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.273
Hey, Mom, look, look. There's a lady
putting gas in her own car.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.475
She can't hear us laughing from here.
Let's go there.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.432
Okay.

08:38.640 --> 08:42.918
Go ahead, lady. Save 25 cents.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.754
You know, Joe,
what really makes me mad?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.356
- What, having a car this colour?
- No. No.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.670
It's all those damn
Japanese imports.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.634
After seeing a bunch of those clunkers,
you don't mind putting elbow grease...

08:56.840 --> 08:59.638
...on one of these
fine American products, huh?

09:02.000 --> 09:06.152
That's why I always got me a bunch
of fine American bumper stickers...

09:06.360 --> 09:08.237
...to show where
I'm coming from. Yep.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.954
It takes a good
American bumper sticker...

09:11.160 --> 09:13.151
...to hold in a headlight, eh, Joe?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.595
Yeah, they sure build them,
don't they?

09:15.800 --> 09:20.191
This roof must be strong to hold up
under the weight of all that bird doody.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.959
If there's no free services left,
I guess I'll be on my way.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.710
- What's the damage?
- Two dollars.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.558
Alrighty.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.479
Here's 1.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.359
And...

09:34.560 --> 09:41.113
...there's 1.10, 1.20, 1.21...

09:43.720 --> 09:45.153
...two dollars.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.991
Gee, Joe, I don't see that smile they
advertise that comes with full service.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.552
Al, the guy inside wants $12
for all this stuff.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.836
I don't have $12.

10:17.440 --> 10:22.560
Gee, kids, look how handsome
Daddy Habib looks in his uniform.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.435
You continue to make us proud,
honey.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.318
Why'd you do it, Peg?

10:28.520 --> 10:30.750
Why'd you eat me into debt?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.036
Well, it's your own fault, Al.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.755
You take us into full-serve,
tell us to think like Rockefellers...

10:36.960 --> 10:40.794
...of course we're gonna go for
the Ho Hos and the Slim Jims.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.197
Don't worry, Daddy. We're gonna
go home now and raise the money...

10:44.400 --> 10:47.472
...to get you out
of this financial fox paws.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.909
Right. We'll have you home cursing
the day you were born in no time.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.388
Yes, please hurry.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.070
For as Jimmy Stewart said
in that great classic, Shenandoah...

10:59.920 --> 11:03.037
Wow, they must really love you
as fast as they headed off.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.755
If they really loved me, they'd be
heading in the direction of my house.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.956
Well, Bundy, we're coming up
on our really busy time of day, so l...

11:11.560 --> 11:16.270
Hey, Joe, I stole my father's car.
Wanna go to the beach?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.835
So I'm going to the beach.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.759
Well, I don't feel ashamed.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.714
I mean, I am a shoe salesman
and I did have my family out in public.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.150
Thank God this station's
not in my neighbourhood.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.033
I mean, the chances of me
seeing anyone I know are about...

11:39.400 --> 11:41.197
Hi, Al.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.590
They're about certain.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.558
See, I told you it was him.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.514
I could see where you would think
it was an orangutan...

11:50.320 --> 11:55.348
...but I knew I recognized that bald spot
when I spotted it from the freeway.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.116
You know, Jefferson, good for you.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.154
You decided to take
the Miller boy camping, huh?

12:04.320 --> 12:07.756
Where's the woman? Out shopping
for some more of those lacy T-shirts...

12:07.960 --> 12:10.428
...that so drive the men crazy?

12:11.160 --> 12:15.676
I'll have you know, Al,
that I happen to like tiny bazooms.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.593
Oh, I had plenty of women
before Marcie...

12:19.800 --> 12:24.351
...and I swear, you get tired
of big, succulent breasts.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.152
Besides, I don't want a bunch of guys
staring at my wife.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.756
I mean, that's the good thing
about Marcie. No guy ever...

12:43.600 --> 12:46.353
That's quite enough, honey bunch.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.194
Well, Al...

12:48.400 --> 12:52.075
...here's something I bet you haven't
heard from a woman in a long time:

12:52.280 --> 12:53.759
Fill her up.

12:58.280 --> 13:03.559
Or do I have to confirm the rumours
and tell you where to put the nozzle?

13:05.240 --> 13:09.028
Well, Marcie, no need to... at me.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.110
We'll fill you up and you can be
on the highway...

13:12.320 --> 13:14.675
...blinding truckers
in about a minute.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.472
There you go.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.873
- That'll be 12 bucks.
- He didn't put any gas in, dear.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.156
Then I'm gonna have to tell
your superior.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.510
Jefferson, find me anyone.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.072
Guess you people are wondering...

13:39.280 --> 13:42.238
...what a man of my position is doing
working in a gas station?

13:42.480 --> 13:44.675
I do it to remind me
of where I've come from.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.388
Couldn't pay for your own gas,
could you?

13:48.840 --> 13:52.037
No. Give me 12 bucks.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.751
Oh, Al, if all it will take is $12
for you to regain your self-respect...

13:56.960 --> 13:59.679
...and get out
of this demeaning position...

13:59.880 --> 14:02.189
...then ask someone who cares.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.035
See you later, Al. Sorry.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.354
Oh, Mother Macree!

14:15.560 --> 14:19.599
Well, hello there, Habib.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.634
Well, family, what is the proper way
to say hello to a friend...

14:23.840 --> 14:25.956
...from the other hemisphere?

14:26.160 --> 14:30.199
May the prophet
smile upon you, Habib.

14:30.640 --> 14:35.953
He already has with this fine job
and the blood that flows in my shoe.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.878
How may this unworthy one
serve you?

14:38.120 --> 14:41.192
Check under the hood.
And I say that not to demean you...

14:41.400 --> 14:43.470
...but to ensure the safety
of my family.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.831
- Oh, I love you, Jim.
- I love you, Betty.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.634
- I love you all.
- Oh, thank you, Jim Jr.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.957
- I love you, father.
- Oh, thank you, Betty Jr.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.994
Now, family,
I have a big surprise for you.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.515
That you've pulled in to full-serve?

14:59.720 --> 15:03.793
No, son. What kind of a dad
would just do that?

15:05.560 --> 15:09.269
No. We're going on a picnic.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.756
Well, what better way to celebrate
another Lundy Sunday Fun Day?

15:12.960 --> 15:15.918
- Oh, thanks!
- Great!

15:18.600 --> 15:21.478
- I love you, Jim.
- I love you too, Betty.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.393
Yeah. And the kids love you too.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.999
Now, that'll be 5 bucks.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.755
Well, there you go.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.350
- Should we give the man a tip, Jim?
- Nope.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.870
I told you we should have
taken my car.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.833
Your car? Since when did you
ever pay for anything?

15:49.040 --> 15:52.476
- Leave Mom alone.
- Drop dead, the lot of you.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.637
Take my advice, buddy.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.832
You probably got a lot of women
pressuring you into marrying them.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.268
But don't do it.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.755
Marriage leads to everything bad
in life:

16:03.960 --> 16:07.589
Work, kids, Habib shirts.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.876
You understand what I mean?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.391
Tell your friends.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.599
What, is my foot invisible?

17:39.800 --> 17:44.078
How can you miss it? It's swollen
to three times its normal size.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.517
Al, don't even say a word.
I've had a terrible day.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.753
Peg, you've been gone seven hours.
Don't tell me you couldn't raise $12.

17:53.160 --> 17:58.280
Al, you have a job and you can't raise
$12 in seven hours.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.597
Do you wanna hear
about my day or what?

18:00.840 --> 18:03.195
I'm sorry. Do go on.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.671
Well, we went back to the house
to look for the money...

18:06.880 --> 18:09.440
...but Mom called.
She was a little down.

18:09.640 --> 18:13.633
She got on a scale today
and it said she weighed 380.

18:15.080 --> 18:19.073
She's been 374 since high school,
and she's afraid...

18:19.280 --> 18:21.919
She's afraid she's getting fat.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.235
Don't worry, Peg, she probably had
6 pounds of food stuck in her teeth.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.635
When I think of how
that woman loves you.

18:30.880 --> 18:35.078
- Thank God she can't hear you.
- Thank God she can't eat me.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.077
Can we get to the money part
of the story?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.077
God, you're so impatient.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.676
Anyway, I found $20 in the pocket
of one of your old shirts.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.275
The shirt that I wanted to wear
but you couldn't find?

18:47.520 --> 18:49.511
Yeah. Maybe I learned a lesson.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.990
I should probably look
when I said I did.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.515
On the way over here,
your car ran out of gas.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.513
- Too bad. Give me the money.
- We don't have any money.

18:57.760 --> 19:02.038
- Well, you said you had $20.
- Well, we did, before the taxi.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.794
What taxi?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.759
Well, the taxi we called
when your car ran out of gas.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.673
It's two blocks away. He's there
with the meter running...

19:11.920 --> 19:14.036
...so stop dilly-dallying
and fill this can up.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.838
Why should I,
what's wrong with you?

19:16.080 --> 19:18.355
We walked in to full-serve.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.957
Now where's that full-serve smile?

19:27.560 --> 19:30.632
Daddy, is Bundy Sunday Fun Day
officially over?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.711
Yes, pumpkin. I'm afraid that it is.

19:32.960 --> 19:36.191
But don't worry. See, next week
we're gonna drive up to the woods...

19:36.440 --> 19:38.556
...and we're going hunting.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.314
See, I'll be the only one
carrying the rifle...

19:42.560 --> 19:46.109
...and you kids can run out there
and flush out the game.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.230
We'll call it Bundy Sunday Gun Day.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.751
- Oh, boy.
- Indeed.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.793
That'll be 2 bucks, Peg.

19:57.040 --> 20:01.192
Get it from my husband.
He's a wealthy shoe salesman.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.273
Not you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.798
Now, they're women,
I expect that from them. But you...

20:08.040 --> 20:11.396
...I expected a little more loyalty
from you.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.631
I tried to talk some sense
into the women.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.713
- I tried to make them hurry.
- Well, what happened?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.235
The sandman got me, Dad.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.072
You know I get all sleepy
when I take a ride in the car.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.629
I napped all the way to the beach.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.679
The house.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.678
Life is rough for you, isn't it, son?

20:33.920 --> 20:36.559
Don't worry, Dad. Bud Bundy
always lands on his feet.

20:36.800 --> 20:40.190
Yeah. We'll find out about that
when I get home.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.990
But I just wanna tell you
one thing, son.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.232
All I wanted to do
was spend one day with my family.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.118
Am I to be punished for this?

20:48.360 --> 20:49.952
Yes.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.795
Because it's a stupid, moronic thing
to waste your Sunday with your family.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.359
Well, I paid for it.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.114
But now it's time for someone else
to pay for it.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.431
Habib is dead.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.989
Long live Habib.

21:05.240 --> 21:11.156
The only way to save this,
this final Bundy Sunday Fun Day...

21:11.400 --> 21:14.949
...is to watch my only son
suffer as I have suffered.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.634
The next car in here is yours.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.869
- Hi.
- We're the Swedish bikini team.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.590
We just love guys named Habib.

21:36.840 --> 21:41.994
Sit in back and enjoy us
as we ride down a bumpy road.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.156
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.629
Hi.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.792
We're the Chicago bowling team.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.878
We're looking for guys named Al.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.271
We love guys named Al.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.638
Let's boogie.
