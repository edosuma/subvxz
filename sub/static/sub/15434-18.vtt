WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:03.010
you seem to have a lot to say.

00:03.060 --> 00:03.969
Well,it's terrible.

00:04.019 --> 00:05.130
It's not terrible.

00:05.180 --> 00:06.390
I have to go to this premiere.

00:06.470 --> 00:08.119
-We'll go together.
-Are you sure?

00:08.180 --> 00:08.990
Let 'em think what they want.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.900
He comes out of the closet for you,

00:10.950 --> 00:12.280
he's yours for life,kid.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.200
He's not coming out of the closet for me.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.410
Keep telling yourself that.

00:15.460 --> 00:19.030
My husband kept a daughter from me,
and now you hang out with her?

00:19.100 --> 00:21.250
Did you honestly think I wouldn't meet her?
She's my sister.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.190
She's here whether we like it or not.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.450
You pulled a hair
out of my head to get my D.N.A.?

00:26.520 --> 00:27.870
-Look--
-I am gonna kill you.

00:27.910 --> 00:29.420
-All right. Okay.I gotta go.
-Please wait.

00:29.470 --> 00:32.060
I'm not a part of this family.
I never will be.

00:32.110 --> 00:35.360
I thought there was a connection,
and I thought you were right there with me.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.670
-I was. I am.
-Doesn't feel like it.

00:40.150 --> 00:42.410
Today I ask all of you

00:42.460 --> 00:46.200
to enlist in a mission
that is bigger than any of us.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.480
There's much at stake.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.660
But I believe the courage of americans
can change this country,

00:52.900 --> 00:55.900
and so I am honored
to join you in this endeavor

00:55.960 --> 00:59.040
as a candidate for president
of the united states.

00:59.540 --> 01:03.250
As I look around at my crewmates
and the veterans here today,

01:03.320 --> 01:06.920
I'm reminded that the best lessons
I learned about being an american

01:06.970 --> 01:09.860
I learned in a place far away from america

01:09.920 --> 01:13.100
on an hh-60g pave hawk in the gulf.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.980
And when we came home,

01:15.030 --> 01:17.150
we had a simple saying--

01:17.200 --> 01:19.010
"every day is an extra."

01:23.010 --> 01:26.000
no,we didn'T.  No.
Who put this in here?

01:26.060 --> 01:27.530
'Cause god knows I didn'T.

01:27.590 --> 01:29.640
oh,I think we're gonna have to take about a 15.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.020
You mean take five.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.030
No,I think this is gonna require 15.

01:38.490 --> 01:41.050
I thought we weren't
gonna mention the damn helicopter.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.520
oh,right,and I can see
where you got that impression,

01:43.590 --> 01:47.100
considering that this whole announcement
centers around the heroism of your,uh--

01:47.130 --> 01:48.320
helicopter rescue.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.650
It's grandstanding,
it reduces me to a prop,

01:50.740 --> 01:52.580
and the writing is
reminiscent of a high school essay.

01:52.650 --> 01:54.020
Campaigning is grandstanding,

01:54.090 --> 01:55.630
and if you're a prop,
you're a heroic one,

01:55.670 --> 01:57.550
and if you're mad at me,
don't take it out on the speechwriter.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.990
-I'm not mad at you.
-You have been cold,and you have been distant

02:00.050 --> 02:02.490
I am three days away from the launch
of my presidential campaign.

02:02.570 --> 02:04.300
I am a little tense.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.360
Do we have to have this conversation here?

02:07.420 --> 02:09.060
We're whispering.

02:09.110 --> 02:10.840
In front of an open mike.

02:15.710 --> 02:18.400
um,you know,
don't take it out on the staff.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.120
-take what out on the staff?
-Our relationship,

02:20.170 --> 02:23.470
or whatever it is since you decided
you had to think about things last week.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.380
I'm sorry

02:24.440 --> 02:26.970
but this whole war hero business
is not a mantle that I wear well.

02:27.020 --> 02:30.280
You know,robert,if you don't believe that
you should be president,nobody else will.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.780
I do believe

02:31.840 --> 02:35.930
but because of a lifetime of service,
not 20 minutes of alleged heroism.

02:36.370 --> 02:38.390
Can we just make this
a little more modest,please?

02:38.470 --> 02:40.900
No,I'm sorry,
but there's nothing modest about it.

02:40.970 --> 02:45.130
You piloted a pave hawk
into enemy territory under heavy fire.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.730
You kept it in the landing zone,
and when the chopper went down,

02:47.780 --> 02:49.980
you ushered five P.O.W.S into safety.

02:50.030 --> 02:51.410
I know,kitty.  I was there.

02:53.970 --> 02:55.560
Look,we're--we're...

02:55.770 --> 02:58.440
with this event,we're just trying to
get everybody's attention.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.700
And I'm telling you
I'm not comfortable with it.

03:02.370 --> 03:04.420
-Okay.
-Thank you.

03:05.780 --> 03:07.440
"something was different.

03:07.490 --> 03:08.890
"He'd changed.

03:08.950 --> 03:10.540
"He was over her,

03:10.600 --> 03:13.480
"and one day,candace would be over him.

03:13.550 --> 03:15.160
But in the meantime,

03:15.220 --> 03:17.570
there was shopping to console her."

03:18.130 --> 03:20.120
no,no,no,no,no.

03:20.170 --> 03:23.570
Juliet,this is... laziness.

03:23.630 --> 03:26.920
I don't know
if you're writing chick lit or a satire

03:26.970 --> 03:29.010
You want specificity.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.200
Take nora as an example,
this piece that she's working on--

03:32.250 --> 03:33.540
it's not tentative.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.990
It's not cautious.

03:35.050 --> 03:37.490
It's smart and urbane.

03:37.530 --> 03:38.910
it's funny!

03:39.390 --> 03:42.700
Read that last paragraph again
so juliet knows what I'm talking about.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.020
You want me to read it again?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.730
Yeah,just the last bit.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.710
Oh. Okay,sure.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.940
um,um,um,um,um...

03:51.940 --> 03:55.610
"'my american husband'
is what she sometimes called brice,

03:55.680 --> 03:58.560
"as though he were more of a citiz than she.

03:58.650 --> 04:01.400
"And if that were the case,
then it meant that without him,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.800
she was a woman without a passport."

04:03.860 --> 04:06.350
"A woman without a passport."

04:06.400 --> 04:08.050
You see what nora's doing?

04:08.150 --> 04:13.660
She's taking the experience of a privileged
housewife from an upper-class L.A.Suburb,

04:13.730 --> 04:18.720
and she's using it to tell a very
subversive story about identity.

04:18.779 --> 04:21.899
-It's good!
-He's really a wonderful teacher.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.100
And he has me writing every day.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.150
He's just wonderful.
I really like him.

04:27.220 --> 04:28.650
Yeah,I can tell.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.910
Do you know I read one of his books?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.970
-Yeah?
-Yeah,it was,uh,

04:33.310 --> 04:34.590
it was kind of sexy.

04:34.620 --> 04:38.020
I mean,there was a-a lot of wife
swapping in marin county...

04:38.070 --> 04:39.950
a lot of wine and cheese.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.780
He's terribly sophisticated...

04:41.840 --> 04:45.010
-And 's--he's charming and--and smart.
-Oh.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.970
He--he's sexy.
He's--he's--he's sexy.

04:47.030 --> 04:48.120
Uh-huh.

04:48.570 --> 04:50.230
So are you,uh,

04:50.550 --> 04:52.280
are you getting a little thing in there?

04:52.340 --> 04:53.990
-Yes,you are!
-No!

04:54.040 --> 04:55.670
stop.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.610
Well,you know,he had you read your stuff twic

04:58.650 --> 05:01.090
maybe he likes you,too.
You know what?

05:01.130 --> 05:03.030
You should see if there's anything there.

05:03.090 --> 05:04.580
You ask him out.That's what you do.

05:04.660 --> 05:07.040
I'm not gonna ask him out!
He's my teacher.

05:07.090 --> 05:10.040
Hey,he's not your fifth grade
chemistry teacher,honey.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.880
You're an adult,
and this is a college extension course.

05:12.940 --> 05:15.200
I mean,what is the worst
that can happen here?

05:15.510 --> 05:17.740
He says you don't float his boat.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.610
Well,maybe under the context
of literary scussion,

05:20.650 --> 05:22.430
-I could credibly...
-uh-huh?

05:22.480 --> 05:24.620
-Ask him for a cup of coffee.
-Yeah.

05:25.430 --> 05:27.170
Uh,I wouldn't do that if I were you.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.980
Are you talking to me,
or are you texting?

05:30.220 --> 05:32.510
That cereal is older than this house.

05:32.570 --> 05:35.020
Bite into it,
and you'll probably chip a tooth.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.130
"L-o-L. C-u there."

05:38.180 --> 05:42.730
Don't you think using a phone to type a
message is like using tv to listen to radio?

05:43.420 --> 05:45.560
What are you doing later,J.?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.940
Wow.What are we up to nicknames already?

05:49.010 --> 05:50.890
I don't know,R.What are you doing?

05:51.330 --> 05:54.240
A friend of romy's
is having a huge party in venice.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.550
Who's romy?

05:55.760 --> 05:57.530
My best girlfriend.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.660
She's dating this guy,jon newsom,
who actually went to marshall.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.940
Anyways,he's,uh,supposedly got this--
this really sweet house in venice.

06:04.000 --> 06:04.980
Do you know him?

06:05.580 --> 06:07.230
Uh,yeah.Yeah,I know jon.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.480
Great. So then you can get us there.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.380
Wait. "Us"?

06:12.450 --> 06:15.760
Well,I'm assuming you like to go out,
and you know jon.

06:16.950 --> 06:19.060
Yeah. The guy's a total bottom-feeder.

06:19.630 --> 06:23.180
A bottom-feeder that romy says
has a kick-ass beach house.

06:23.230 --> 06:25.350
I'd rather go to a movie.
You want to go to a movie instead?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.410
God,you cannot be that lame.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.080
You look like a hard-core partier.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.560
Kind of the problem.

06:32.730 --> 06:35.510
Till recently,
my partng has been kind of drug-dependent.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.850
So who cares?

06:39.370 --> 06:40.720
You're not freaked out?

06:40.770 --> 06:43.610
Well,as if you're the only guy
I know with addiction problems.

06:43.650 --> 06:46.630
It's L.A. You throa rock,
and you hit someone who's working the steps.

06:46.820 --> 06:50.730
it's just,like,it's my first party--
like,real party--since rehab,that's all.

06:50.770 --> 06:54.780
Mm.Well,if your newly discovered half sister
wasn't enough for you to fall off the wagon,

06:54.830 --> 06:56.300
I don't think anything else will.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.580
I'm kind of used to being
the bad influence around here.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.150
There's a new black sheep in town,
J. Get used to it.

07:01.230 --> 07:04.450
Okay,you know,we're gonna have to
lose the whole "j" thing like yesterday.

07:04.510 --> 07:08.070
so we're all set then.Steve's polishing
the revisions on the revised tenth draft.

07:08.130 --> 07:10.670
Twelfth,if you don't count the ten
that I didn't show him before that.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.700
Marjorie set the itinerary for the
whistle-stops following the announcement.

07:13.780 --> 07:16.140
Dan's on microtargeting,
and kitty's overseeing the videography.

07:16.190 --> 07:17.430
Well,you know,gary,that's the thing.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.890
I-I just don't think that
I'm the most qualified person to handle that.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.860
It's quick pops of people
from the senator's hometown--

07:22.900 --> 07:25.440
testimonials,favorable,light stories.
It's a cakewalk.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.040
Exactly. That's why
the videographers don't really need me.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.680
Well,someone's gotta ask the questions,kitty.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.330
I mean,come on.I--I just think
we need somebody who's--"taller."

07:33.390 --> 07:37.230
Well,I was gonna say more high-profile--
a-a celebrity maybe.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.340
We're republicans.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.410
Our one celebrity's busy running california.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.570
Castroville?

07:43.630 --> 07:48.180
Isn't it a small disadvantage to be
a presidential candidate from castroville?

07:48.250 --> 07:51.180
Well,at least
it's not elephant butte,new mexico.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.200
I am googling...

07:54.360 --> 07:56.810
"castroville."

07:57.850 --> 07:59.440
It's in monterey.

07:59.490 --> 08:03.160
Marilyn monroe
was crowned artichoke queen there in 1947.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.860
What,did she lose a bet?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.910
No,it's the artichoke capital of the world.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.180
I can't believe that gary is making me do

08:10.250 --> 08:13.300
an entire weekend
of hero-worshipping puff pieces

08:13.340 --> 08:15.200
on my mean boyfriend
who I'm having a fight with

08:15.240 --> 08:18.070
who I'm not supposed to be having a fight
with because he's running for president,

08:18.100 --> 08:20.830
like that's some big deal or something.

08:20.870 --> 08:23.150
-Did you get all that out?
-Not even close.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.690
Hey,I could go with you.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.730
There are beaches,wineries.

08:26.780 --> 08:29.530
You know,
we could make a girls' weekend of it--

08:29.580 --> 08:31.660
eat junk food,bash men--

08:31.730 --> 08:33.360
sarah,I'm supposed to be working.

08:33.659 --> 08:37.980
oh,there's a spa that does artichoke facials.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.169
Kitty,I need this.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.049
If I don't get away from joe
and the kids for a few days,

08:41.100 --> 08:43.590
we're gonna end up on the evening news.
You think I'm joking?

08:43.669 --> 08:45.270
-Sarah
-kitty,

08:45.320 --> 08:47.670
I'm a desperate woman.
Don't make me beg.

08:47.730 --> 08:51.410
Oh,all right,just make the reservation
and book me a swedish massage

08:51.460 --> 08:53.120
and an artichoke facial.

08:53.170 --> 08:54.320
Okay. Ciao.

08:57.530 --> 08:59.190
artichoke facial.

09:12.070 --> 09:14.860
what are you doing?
Come back to bed. It's so early.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.270
No,I can't sleep.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.370
Oh. Was I snoring or something?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.920
I don't want to go on like this.

09:22.770 --> 09:23.800
What?

09:23.880 --> 09:26.590
This is the thing.
I was sitting here watching you sleep,

09:26.990 --> 09:28.730
and you looked so happy.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.350
I started thinking about all the things
that people do together that we can'T.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.410
What,like get a good night's sleep?

09:34.490 --> 09:35.970
Like travel,

09:36.480 --> 09:39.730
-like being open.
-All right.so what are you saying?

09:40.030 --> 09:41.490
My manager.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.990
I'm gonna fire my manager.

09:45.070 --> 09:47.600
I'm gonna start changing everything
now,today.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.860
Wait.Wait,wait.

09:48.930 --> 09:52.010
You're--you're gonna fire donald?
Why would you do that?

09:52.060 --> 09:55.190
Because he keeps shoving me back
into the closet,

09:56.260 --> 09:58.290
and it's too late.

10:00.620 --> 10:01.940
Wait a minute.

10:02.330 --> 10:04.220
Since when did you know his name?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.520
What?

10:05.580 --> 10:07.750
How did you know his name was donald?

10:09.610 --> 10:12.450
Chad,you've entioned him,
like,a thousand times.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.320
Look,can we--
let's just have some coffee,okay,and talk?

10:16.390 --> 10:20.450
Please,please,don't fire him
until,like,after lunch,okay?

10:21.110 --> 10:24.080
I don't want this double life anymore,kev.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.280
Okay.

10:25.350 --> 10:26.960
I have to be who I'm gonna be,

10:27.030 --> 10:29.510
and whoever's in my life
that won't accept that,

10:29.590 --> 10:31.050
I have to get rid of.

10:32.430 --> 10:33.950
I've gotta go talk to him,all right?

10:34.010 --> 10:35.850
-Today,now.
-All right,sure.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.550
-We'll talk later,all right?
-Okay.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.400
excuse me.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.490
Uh,have i missed your office hours?

10:47.560 --> 10:49.410
No,I'm like a doctor,nora,

10:49.460 --> 10:50.900
always on call.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.530
Um,because if you're finished here--

10:53.580 --> 10:55.510
I-I really don't want to hold you up.

10:55.590 --> 10:58.990
I just wanted to tell you that I,um...

10:59.050 --> 11:01.130
you've been so encouraging.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.460
Well,I love the work you're doing.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.090
I-is that what you came to tell me?

11:07.730 --> 11:10.310
all the way from pasadena?

11:10.380 --> 11:12.820
No. No,I was working in the library.

11:12.860 --> 11:16.080
I-I like to get out of the house--
casa de chaos.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.840
I call it that sometimes.
Uh,do--do you have children?

11:20.890 --> 11:23.000
-Uh,two.
-Two.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.940
-Killers.
-Oh,killers,yes.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.740
-You?
-Five... murderers.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.630
so is there--is that--
you have a mate then probably,is what--

11:31.700 --> 11:33.420
uh,not so much anymore.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.980
Do you drink coffee?
Uh,theoretical coffee.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.420
It could be orange juice or something
with bubbles.It doesn't have to be--

11:39.470 --> 11:40.910
-nora.
-Yes?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.570
You're forgetting how to speak.

11:43.110 --> 11:44.770
Theoretical coffee?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.600
It's crafty.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.210
Emily craft.
She's--she's my girlfriend.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.490
I've known her since high school.
She gets me into these things,and--

11:50.550 --> 11:53.990
listen,if you were asking me
would I like to grab a coffee with you...

11:54.070 --> 11:55.380
You see this pack?

11:55.870 --> 11:57.700
I'm preparing my picnic lunch.

11:57.770 --> 12:00.650
If you like,
you could join me on the grass.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.510
We could watch the kids,swap stories.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.090
Fine.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:21.340 --> 12:23.010
there's something odd about this.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.930
-This what?
-This town.

12:25.020 --> 12:29.480
Oh,was the,uh,giant,man-made artichoke
in the town square your first clue?

12:29.540 --> 12:32.120
-No,though that was odd.
-Huh.

12:32.190 --> 12:34.700
Excuse me.
All the stores seem closed.

12:34.740 --> 12:37.170
Yeah,closed for the festival,
the annual artichoke festival.

12:37.230 --> 12:38.290
The whole town shuts down.

12:38.370 --> 12:40.660
Did you say the whole town?
Including...

12:40.730 --> 12:42.150
-the spas...
-spas...

12:42.190 --> 12:45.720
and--and wineries
and--and spas?

12:45.770 --> 12:48.480
Sarah,I thought you were supposed
to call and make an appointment? I asked--

12:48.530 --> 12:49.930
no,
they said walk-ins were available.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.460
Why do I always have to
be the one that books everything?

12:51.460 --> 12:53.520
Because you told me that you were gonna
book it.You told me that,right?

12:53.580 --> 12:55.610
Uh,here's the list of interview subjects.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.790
It's the usual characters.
I want a massage.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.390
You got your social studies teacher,
the football coach,the best friend...

12:59.440 --> 13:02.680
"nick higgin,simon jarvis,alice webb."

13:02.730 --> 13:03.590
who's that?

13:03.640 --> 13:06.370
Sounds like the senator's
geriatric first grade teacher.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.700
-"H-s-s-h"?
-Yeah,uh,high school sweetheart.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.240
I'll see you guys inside.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.820
then I was married for 21 years

13:17.210 --> 13:20.330
until my wife passed about five years ago.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.030
Oh,I know how hard that is.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.480
Oh,it's the second year that's hard.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.440
The second year is a little bit of hell,

13:28.190 --> 13:31.280
and don't believe anyone
who tells you that it isn'T.

13:31.330 --> 13:32.810
I think for me...

13:34.840 --> 13:38.990
the hard part has come and gone,
and I'm still standing.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.880
Do you...

13:42.410 --> 13:44.880
do you see people?

13:45.290 --> 13:46.830
-Women?
-Mm-hmm.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.960
Yeah,but not really.

13:50.010 --> 13:51.310
I mean,

13:51.380 --> 13:54.010
the connections are few and far between.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.050
I've turned out to be a man of,uh,

13:58.130 --> 14:02.210
really particular tastes in my old age.

14:02.260 --> 14:04.130
I like being around the kids.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.680
what about you?

14:07.740 --> 14:10.010
Well,it has recently come to my attention

14:10.060 --> 14:15.710
that I can do whatever the hell
I want on this sweet planet.

14:16.470 --> 14:19.670
I can afford to travel.
I can afford to stay home.

14:19.740 --> 14:22.640
I... don't scare easy.
I'm not afraid of a fight,

14:23.880 --> 14:25.240
and I've learned some lessons.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.360
I--I'd like to use them.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.170
God.

14:30.180 --> 14:32.470
I should be taking class from you.

14:34.070 --> 14:35.220
Uh...

14:36.340 --> 14:40.940
I have to throw a party for some professors--

14:40.990 --> 14:44.950
cocktails--tonight...
at my house.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.580
Would you like to,um...

14:50.260 --> 14:52.100
be my date?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.880
Sure.  I'd love to.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.410
-You lied to me!
-I'm sorry.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.910
I should've told you
that your manager and I talked.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.410
I was--you know,chad,
I was actually trying--

15:03.450 --> 15:04.770
to what?

15:04.840 --> 15:06.750
You went behind my back.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.360
The two of you were
scheming behind my back.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.040
Chad,he called me.

15:11.090 --> 15:13.460
What were you and donald in cahoots for?

15:13.850 --> 15:16.520
-What were you planning?
-Oh,wow. "Planning"?

15:16.570 --> 15:19.110
This is so paranoid.
He cares about you,chad.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.950
You know,this is so boring to me.
You know that?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.130
My life is changing,
there are rumors out there about me,

15:24.180 --> 15:26.090
-and you think I'm boring?
-No.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.430
Anything but,actually.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.650
However,this little drama of peekaboo in
and out of the closet

15:30.680 --> 15:34.760
and the hysteria it inspires is
starting to wear just a little bit thin.

15:34.790 --> 15:37.240
Because I'm freaked out
about the implications of coming out

15:37.300 --> 15:38.840
and what that might mean to my career?

15:38.890 --> 15:42.430
Oh,god. I--you know,
I hate that word

15:42.460 --> 15:44.850
"career."
It's like the modern-day "religion."

15:44.900 --> 15:47.810
What about your life?
You know what your problem is,chad?

15:47.850 --> 15:51.220
You can't make a decision
about what it is you want,

15:51.270 --> 15:54.120
and this little panic of yours
is just gonna keep happening.

15:54.150 --> 15:57.010
You're not coming out of any closet,okay?

15:57.060 --> 16:00.080
And this faux little crisis of yours
is just gonna keep going on and on.

16:00.130 --> 16:01.430
You know what?

16:01.790 --> 16:03.820
I don't want to be a part of that anymore.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.360
-So what you're saying is--
-what I'm saying is,chad,

16:07.410 --> 16:09.860
some relationships need drama
in order to survive.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.020
I don't want that kind of relationship,okay?

16:12.070 --> 16:16.240
I don't want to be a part of some
humiliating,semi-'50s throwback affair

16:16.280 --> 16:18.380
just because you're gorgeous
and everything else that you are.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.580
-Lifes too damn short.
-That's for sure.

16:23.810 --> 16:27.660
BTW,it's great to know that the only reason
you're attracted to me is because of my...

16:27.710 --> 16:30.310
looks.  You're an ass,kevin.

16:31.110 --> 16:32.680
You know that?

16:35.300 --> 16:38.420
I always knew how...

16:38.490 --> 16:40.850
how principled he was.

16:41.060 --> 16:44.910
But when I saw on the tv
how he rescued those men in that helicopter,

16:45.400 --> 16:47.880
that's when I knew he was brave,too.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.410
Was that strange,

16:49.440 --> 16:52.060
finding out that
your high school boyfriend was a war hero?

16:52.100 --> 16:55.380
Well,it was strange,
but not surprising.

16:55.990 --> 16:59.670
-Bobby was always remarkable.
-Bobby?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.290
yeah,that--that's cute.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.190
So,um,maybe you could talk a little bit
about your relationship?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.880
I guess it was pretty normal.
It was a high school thing.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.609
Um,I wore his varsity jacket.
Uh,we went to dans together.

17:12.700 --> 17:17.079
Did you have any differences--
uh,arguments,maybe? Fights,big fights?

17:17.310 --> 17:20.670
-Mm,no,not that I can remember.
-Really? Huh.

17:21.260 --> 17:24.329
Well,I mean,it couldn't
have all been roses and artichokes.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.140
We were pretty happy.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.780
Well,something had to have...

17:32.440 --> 17:34.270
well--well,yeah.Well,you were happy.

17:34.300 --> 17:38.070
But--but something had to have happened.
I mean,obviously you're not together anymore.

17:38.130 --> 17:42.280
It was a mutual decision.
We went to colleges on opposite coasts.

17:42.350 --> 17:44.970
-We knew we're too young for a long-distancer
-stupid artichoke.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.310
Oh,I am so sorry.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.170
it's okay.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.810
Uh,so--yeah,no,I mean,it's--
you know,we all know how guys're at that age.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.570
-They're immature and grabby.
-No.

17:55.630 --> 17:57.340
Was he grabby? I bet he was.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.050
Don't you work for him?

18:00.100 --> 18:01.900
Yeah. Yeah,but nobody--

18:01.960 --> 18:04.670
nobody is that perfect,
not even mr.Mcsainthood.

18:04.730 --> 18:06.410
-excuse me.
-What are you doing,sarah?

18:06.460 --> 18:07.640
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

18:07.640 --> 18:08.730
This is supposed to be a puff piece,

18:08.790 --> 18:11.420
and instead you're picking fights
with the high school sweetheart.

18:11.470 --> 18:12.780
You know what we're gonna do?

18:12.850 --> 18:14.740
You're gonna give your crew the day off.

18:14.790 --> 18:17.320
You and I are gonna find the nearest bar
and close it down.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.320
Oh,I'm sure it's already closed.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.520
-The festival.
-Don't say that,not even as a joke.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.710
Rebecca?

18:37.270 --> 18:41.170
Oh. I'm just waiting for justin.
We're going to dinner,

18:41.230 --> 18:45.000
and there there's a party,
like a mutual frnd thing.

18:45.050 --> 18:46.280
They're just pictures,rebecca.

18:46.350 --> 18:49.560
It's not like I caught you
rifling through my underwear drawer.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.490
Yeah,I was just looking at these
pictures thinking,but they look so normal

18:55.550 --> 18:59.600
I think we are pretty normal,
given the circumstances.

19:00.800 --> 19:05.560
Your son pulled a hair out of my head
to run a D.N.A. Test. Which is ironic,

19:05.620 --> 19:10.510
because he doesn't know if your middle son's baby
is his or your youngest son'S.

19:10.570 --> 19:14.580
Ah.Yes,wl,when you put it that way,
we do have our eccentricities.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.290
It's cool,though.
Mean,it explains a lot,actually.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.700
Like what?

19:19.750 --> 19:23.300
I don't know,like all the weirdness in my life,
all the drama.

19:23.380 --> 19:25.250
Maybe it's genetic,right?

19:25.840 --> 19:28.600
Rebecca,
drama is not the only thing you inherited.

19:29.090 --> 19:32.230
No,I also have a trust
worth a couple million dollars.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.100
That's not what I meant.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.270
You've also inherited a big family...

19:36.950 --> 19:38.800
william's family.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.210
Hmm.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.840
Is that all right?

19:43.910 --> 19:45.590
That--that's fine.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.320
Rebecca...

19:52.280 --> 19:54.460
didn't you ever ask about your father?

19:56.160 --> 19:58.930
My mother said that he was a film director.

19:59.420 --> 20:04.730
And,um,what did holly--
your mother--tell you?

20:04.780 --> 20:07.070
I mean,why did he leave?

20:08.070 --> 20:11.760
Um,she said that
she never told him she was pregnant.

20:14.770 --> 20:16.400
Oh.

20:22.810 --> 20:26.050
I think that your husband knew.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.520
He gave me a doll once.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.800
He was,you know,around.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.800
I'm sorry.
Maybe I shouldn't have said that. I--

20:37.860 --> 20:39.680
no,it's okay.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.880
I'd still like to know...

20:44.030 --> 20:46.460
who my father was.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.470
Of course you would.

20:49.580 --> 20:53.340
Rebecca,he was a good father.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.130
He was a good businessman.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.330
He was very smart.
He could be very kind.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.950
He also carried on a 20-year affair,

21:00.990 --> 21:03.640
embezzled from his own company
and kept a child from me.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.330
Now that's the whole truth.

21:06.910 --> 21:08.990
whoa. Mom,step away from the offspring.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.690
It's okay.  We're just talking.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.660
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.940
-Bye.
-Bye.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.340
you have lost your mind.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.840
No,I know exactly where I left it.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.390
We're re to praise mccallister,
not to bury him.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.400
I thought we were here on a girls' weekend.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.800
Oh,that was about a million artichokes ago.

21:29.860 --> 21:31.450
Mm. We need another ar-ti-rita.

21:31.510 --> 21:33.030
Nope. No more for you.
You've had enough.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.600
Come on,sarah. Just--just one.

21:34.690 --> 21:35.540
One for the road.

21:35.600 --> 21:39.130
No. You can't keep up with me.
It'll only end in tears.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.750
One more,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.800
but only because I feel sorry for you.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.950
And don't drunk-dial any U.S. Senators.

21:48.410 --> 21:49.720
please.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.960
Hola.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.740
-Two ar-ti-ritas,please.
-Comin' up.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.040
I'll get those.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.370
oh,and they say chivalry is dead.

22:00.430 --> 22:01.600
Are you here for the festival?

22:01.640 --> 22:04.360
No,no. My sister over there--"work."

22:05.300 --> 22:06.760
What about you guys?

22:07.670 --> 22:09.330
We go to school here.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.630
Don't tell me.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.380
Artichoke community college?

22:13.450 --> 22:16.290
Uh,there must be something in the water,or--

22:16.350 --> 22:21.000
or the artichokes,
because everybody in this town loves you.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.070
Really?

22:22.130 --> 22:25.580
I guess my multimillion-dollar donation check
to the chamber of commerce must have cleared

22:25.630 --> 22:27.710
Oh,oh,and guess who I met?

22:27.780 --> 22:30.200
Alice webb--my high school girlfriend.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.620
And what--what kind of a name is alice anyy?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.140
What kind of name is kitty?

22:34.210 --> 22:37.680
Hey,do they still have that artichoke ice cream?
'Cause I remember it as being pretty good.

22:37.730 --> 22:40.180
No,no,no,
don't try to change the subject,mister.

22:40.240 --> 22:45.050
I got alice,and I tell you,man,she--
she gave me the dirt on you.

22:45.100 --> 22:48.100
Boy,I could hardly shut her up.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.890
-Are you still there?
-Yeah.

22:52.930 --> 22:56.820
-Well,you--you got so quiet.
-Alice webb's not a joke.

22:56.870 --> 22:59.860
Well,why?
What happened with alice?

22:59.930 --> 23:01.500
Kitty,just let it go.

23:01.570 --> 23:03.210
Let what--what go?

23:03.270 --> 23:05.350
Listen,I have to work on the speech.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.140
Let me call you later,okay?

23:08.130 --> 23:11.400
okay,guys. Thanks for the invite.
See you there.

23:11.710 --> 23:15.060
awesome.*Guess who got invited to a kegger?*

23:16.980 --> 23:18.180
Oh,no way.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.310
-Mm-hmm. Drink up,baby.
-Unh-unh.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.830
-kevin walker.
-Hey,hey,kevin!

23:30.890 --> 23:33.730
This is dan silk from theskinnyminnie.Com.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.820
I got your number from my attorney.

23:35.870 --> 23:38.560
I don't have anything to say to you,
you contemptible little--

23:38.640 --> 23:43.250
well,I thought you might have a quote
on the subject of chad barry's bold coming out.

23:43.310 --> 23:44.760
Excuse me?

23:44.810 --> 23:47.180
Funny. I thought you'd be the first to know.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.610
He's written an open letter on his fan web site.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.230
Bad grammar,but pretty powerful stuff.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.810
I've posted it on my site.

23:53.860 --> 23:58.680
I think it's worthy of some...
comment,don't you?

23:59.190 --> 24:01.100
Yeah,here's my comment--bite me.

24:05.940 --> 24:06.920
you're freaked out,aren't you?

24:06.980 --> 24:08.180
uh,it's just a party.

24:08.230 --> 24:09.390
No,I mean my mother.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.140
She said something to you.
You look freaked.

24:11.190 --> 24:12.550
No,she didn't say anything.

24:12.610 --> 24:15.100
You two should not be left alone together.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.690
Look,we can get out of here if you want.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.690
No,no. This is exactly what I need--
just get out,have some fun--

24:20.750 --> 24:22.930
-yeah,see? You are freaked.
-Walker!

24:25.200 --> 24:26.200
What's up,bro?

24:26.270 --> 24:27.500
Hey,man.

24:27.570 --> 24:29.580
Hey. Sweet ride.

24:29.650 --> 24:31.080
That's my sister.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.860
No mas. My bad.

24:32.910 --> 24:35.200
-Sorry. Jon.
-Rebecca.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.600
It's all good.

24:36.660 --> 24:38.040
You guys want to hit the bathroom?

24:38.100 --> 24:40.980
-We got some party supplies.
-Sounds fun.

24:42.390 --> 24:43.420
You coming,bro?

24:44.740 --> 24:46.850
Uh,I'm good,man.

24:53.220 --> 24:56.580
This is a date little faculty cocktail party.

24:56.640 --> 24:57.900
-Kitty wore that in high school.
-Let's see. Here.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.030
I'm not gonna wear that.

24:59.090 --> 25:00.890
Look,this may be a cocktail party,

25:00.940 --> 25:05.080
but I don't know which blanket that
little piggy's gonna be under,if you get my drift.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.050
I don't even know what that means.

25:07.110 --> 25:10.710
I mean,who knows
if there even is gonna be a party at all?

25:10.780 --> 25:15.900
This professor's ruse of inviting you to
a "professors' little party," that's code

25:15.960 --> 25:21.030
That is 21st century speech for--
"please come.We're the party,baby."

25:21.080 --> 25:23.620
-oh,for god's sakes.I'm telling you...
-You gotta be sexy.

25:23.670 --> 25:27.600
you do.You're not auditioning
for a faculty tea wife here.

25:27.660 --> 25:31.190
Damn! How do you survive without me?

25:31.370 --> 25:32.530
-You know what?
-What?

25:32.580 --> 25:34.650
I promise you when you get there,

25:34.710 --> 25:36.200
there are gonna be two guests--

25:36.260 --> 25:40.140
-you and professor sexenberg.
-"Professor sexenberg"?

25:40.190 --> 25:42.910
Oh,my god.
Why do I even listen to you?

25:42.970 --> 25:46.160
-Hey.
-Oh,you know,this is my--this is a great dress.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.120
This is that nice little jil sander dress.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.050
You've seen me wear this.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.390
Eh,I think that was maybe nice
when fawn hall was around.

25:52.440 --> 25:53.970
You know what that is?

25:54.040 --> 25:58.140
That is about 6 inches too short for today...

25:58.570 --> 26:00.770
about 6 inches too long for a lay is whathat--

26:00.830 --> 26:03.910
-oh! I'm not listening to you.
-Okay,what have we got? Ooh,hang on.

26:03.970 --> 26:06.080
Why are you--
why--

26:06.140 --> 26:07.750
-why am I doing this?
-Yes.

26:07.810 --> 26:11.220
I'm doing this because
you do not have one piece of clothing

26:11.300 --> 26:17.740
that talks about filthy,happy,hot,muddy,dirty sex.

26:17.790 --> 26:19.220
-Well,I--thank god!
-Ezco a dios!

26:19.280 --> 26:21.370
When's the last time you actually wore this thing?

26:21.430 --> 26:22.990
I wore that to the brillstein bar mitzvah.

26:23.060 --> 26:23.910
-Eh.
-It's nice. It fits--

26:23.960 --> 26:25.870
-it--you know,it is--
-all right,here we go.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.900
-Wait! Wait! Aah!
-Trust me.

26:32.230 --> 26:33.800
It's not just me.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.080
It's not just me.
It's a great,big party

26:37.150 --> 26:39.850
with lots and lots and lots of people.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.490
I'll get lost in the crowd.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.260
It's not just me.\MIt's a huge,big party.

26:44.310 --> 26:45.470
I'll be glad I'm here.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.610
Coming!

26:48.860 --> 26:50.490
Hey,nora! Come in.

26:51.930 --> 26:54.280
w! What an outfit.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.540
There is no party,is there?
Fine.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.970
Well,you know the members
of the jack london awards committee...

27:01.030 --> 27:03.280
-"jack london awards committee"?
-Are going to love this vintage.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.360
-The writer jack london awards committee?
-Ladies and gentlemen,

27:05.410 --> 27:09.260
may I present nora walker,
a very promising writer?

27:09.610 --> 27:11.730
Is she gonna dance for us?

27:14.550 --> 27:15.900
-this has gotta be it.
-I just--I just really--

27:15.960 --> 27:17.420
I don't want us to embarrass ourselves.

27:17.490 --> 27:19.640
-Okay,slurry.
-I'm not slurring.

27:19.690 --> 27:21.800
I just want to act like a grown-up tonight.

27:21.850 --> 27:23.530
This is a really good color on you.

27:23.590 --> 27:24.780
Come on,slurry.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.130
Oh!

27:26.200 --> 27:27.480
in here,in here.

27:27.530 --> 27:29.420
-excuse me.
-Yeah. Oh,hey!

27:31.110 --> 27:32.090
Hey,what's up,guys?

27:32.160 --> 27:33.610
Hey,you guys. How are you?

27:33.900 --> 27:35.560
oh,my god.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.610
"Sesame street" is having a party.

27:38.670 --> 27:40.150
Hey! You made it.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.350
Hey... you.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.350
You go to school here,right?

27:44.420 --> 27:47.020
Yeah... north monterey high.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.710
Oh...

27:49.070 --> 27:50.370
hey!

27:50.670 --> 27:53.200
dude,I told you we'd get those cougars to showup.

27:53.290 --> 27:55.930
-Did he just call us "cougars"?
-Yes,he did.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.750
Drinks,ladies?

28:01.410 --> 28:05.980
(tracy bonham's "something beautiful" playing)

28:06.310 --> 28:10.820
*lightweight,too straight no reaction*

28:10.880 --> 28:15.660
*I don't care if I'm not in fashion,I will*

28:15.710 --> 28:17.360
god,you're wasted.

28:20.090 --> 28:22.110
Look,all right,let's get you home and get you
a cup of coffee and put you to bed,okay?

28:22.190 --> 28:24.820
Please don't start getting
all big brotherly with me.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.290
-It's just gonna freak me out even more.
-Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

28:26.340 --> 28:27.310
Come on. Come on. Come on.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.240
Can we just call it a night at this point,rebecca?

28:29.300 --> 28:31.650
It's really sweet of you
to try to be all protective.

28:31.700 --> 28:35.650
It's the walker thing.You guys all
take care of each other,but I didn't have

28:35.710 --> 28:40.540
the all-american,apple pie earnest mom
and pop with 16 siblings.

28:41.910 --> 28:43.150
I gotta go to the bathroom.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.790
Look,no,you've done enough business
in the bathroom,rebecca.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.880
-Get off of me.
-Come on!

28:45.930 --> 28:47.050
Ooh. Everything cool here?

28:47.110 --> 28:48.920
Yeah,it's fine.
It's a family spat. Let's go.

28:50.420 --> 28:52.280
I think she wants you to step off,bro.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.400
Why don't you step off,bro?

28:55.950 --> 28:57.080
Or what?

28:58.350 --> 28:59.810
come on,let's go.
Go!

29:04.580 --> 29:06.290
I can't believe you did it.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.760
Yeah,well,I did.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.030
I mean,you were right.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.340
It was time.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.020
It's--chad,it's a great thing.

29:14.060 --> 29:17.480
I love the letter you wrote.
I thought it was brave and honest,

29:17.530 --> 29:21.190
but,you know,everything's happening so fast,
and you did everything alone.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.520
I just thought about
all the things you said to me.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.970
Yeah,well,you know,I wasn't right
about everything.I was pretty harsh.

29:28.020 --> 29:29.730
Maybe that's what I needed.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.410
I think it's what we needed.

29:36.180 --> 29:40.260
kevin,I didn't,uh...
(Lucinda williams' "rescue" playing)

29:40.650 --> 29:44.610
I didn't come out of the closet for you...or us.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.170
I came out for me.

29:47.670 --> 29:50.930
I mean,you were right.
We're not in the same place right now.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.760
I really appreciate all the pushing,but...

29:56.820 --> 30:00.300
I think I need to go the rest of
the distance in my own way

30:01.050 --> 30:02.870
at my own pace,

30:02.930 --> 30:04.810
by myself.

30:05.670 --> 30:08.830
*The hours of insanity*

30:08.900 --> 30:11.620
-wow.
-Look,I-I.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.710
Couldn't have gotten to where I am without you.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.850
Chad,I am so sorry I was so rough with you.

30:22.150 --> 30:24.090
Really,I am.

30:27.110 --> 30:30.980
*the thunderstorms within your purity*

30:31.030 --> 30:32.740
it's too late,isn't it?

30:34.160 --> 30:37.150
*He can't change you*

30:38.270 --> 30:39.340
-I'm gonna go.
-Oh.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.900
*He can't save you*

30:43.070 --> 30:47.890
*from the plain and simple truth*

30:48.420 --> 30:52.710
*the waning winters of your youth*

30:55.130 --> 30:57.780
*he can't save you*

30:58.200 --> 31:00.360
-well,we could still,uh--
-no.

31:02.090 --> 31:04.440
No,we can'T.

31:04.490 --> 31:08.680
*...Tears will always leave a mark*

31:08.940 --> 31:09.930
excuse me.

31:09.980 --> 31:12.970
Is that a romper suit?
I have never felt this old in my life.

31:13.050 --> 31:17.160
-Well,what about the time with--
-you finish that sentence,you're dead to me

31:17.210 --> 31:20.690
-Ok,there's gotta be ...
-hey,ladies.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.020
-...The number of a cab by the phone...
-Artichoke shot?

31:22.070 --> 31:23.240
-Yum.No!
-Ouch!

31:23.290 --> 31:28.040
No,we are not gonna start partying down with--
with unaccompanied minors.

31:28.100 --> 31:32.020
I mean,I don't want to end up
on an afterschool special.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.870
I liked those specials. Remember those?

31:35.510 --> 31:38.230
which way is up?
Trying to get my hustle on

31:38.300 --> 31:40.060
-oh,God.Holy heaven.
-Oh,God.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.890
how many women our age
did you invite to this party?

31:42.960 --> 31:44.460
You know,you should be ashamed of yourself.

31:44.510 --> 31:47.000
-Oh,my god. I'm dead.
-You and me both.

31:47.050 --> 31:48.500
-Why?
-It's my mom.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.180
it's Alice Webb.

31:50.240 --> 31:54.180
-Alice Webb is your mom?
-Yeah. Oh.I'm so screwed.

31:54.250 --> 31:55.690
-This is alice'S...
-this is alice webb's house?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.370
-We--what do we--go--
-back door.

31:57.420 --> 31:59.290
-Leave.
-Back--back door.Come on!

31:59.710 --> 32:01.220
Ms. Walker?

32:03.120 --> 32:07.060
-uh,yes?
-Yes,she is. Um...

32:07.130 --> 32:08.990
you should put ice on that eye.

32:09.050 --> 32:11.420
I actually want the black eye
for as long as possible

32:11.480 --> 32:14.060
to remind me not to be such a chivalrous ass.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.290
I wish I was a chivalrous ass
instead of being just wholly an ass.

32:19.940 --> 32:22.500
Oh,don't go hard onourself.
Maybe you just haven't found the right...

32:22.930 --> 32:24.290
dude yet,you know?

32:24.350 --> 32:27.090
what if chad was the right guy?
What if I pushed him away?

32:31.860 --> 32:33.180
Mom?

32:33.930 --> 32:36.450
Uh,how was--
how was your night...

32:37.420 --> 32:39.240
with your pimp?

32:39.960 --> 32:42.390
don't look at me,really,

32:42.440 --> 32:45.480
and don't--not another comment
from either one of you.  Got it?

32:45.540 --> 32:48.410
Got it. I mean,clearly you've--
you've had a taxing night.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.510
Which--
which hotel bar are you working out of?

32:51.570 --> 32:54.580
-I listened to emily craft again.
-ohh.

32:54.630 --> 32:57.390
God! She told me that I had to wear this,

32:57.440 --> 33:01.300
that I have to compete with the other
20-year-old girls in my writing class.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.220
Well,maybe you shouldn't listen to her.
She's a bad seed.

33:04.960 --> 33:11.690
-Justin,oh,honey!
-Oh.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.180
-What happened?Are you all right?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:14.230 --> 33:17.010
Maybe you should concentrate on kevin.
Chad dumped him.

33:17.060 --> 33:19.550
-Oh,you S...
-oh,kev,I'm so sorry.

33:19.620 --> 33:20.710
You know what?

33:20.780 --> 33:22.110
I'm gonna join a monastery anyway

33:22.170 --> 33:25.230
one of those vow-of-silence places
so I can stay out of trouble.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.380
Well,you'd probably find a way,

33:26.440 --> 33:29.640
especially with all those monks
batting their eyes at you.

33:29.690 --> 33:32.870
Oh,what a sorry bunch we are.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.630
Look at us. God.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.000
What a family! Yikes.

33:38.390 --> 33:41.690
Who would like to have some scrambled
eggs and toasted english muffins

33:41.740 --> 33:44.620
just to soothe over all of our bruises?
All right.

33:45.620 --> 33:46.840
I'm so sorry.

33:46.890 --> 33:49.680
It's just we were--we were in a-a bar,

33:49.730 --> 33:51.650
and your son--and he asked my s--

33:51.710 --> 33:53.600
it was long--it was--it's a long story,

33:53.640 --> 33:57.770
but,you know,I'm really so glad that I,
um,caught up with you,

33:57.800 --> 34:01.110
because I realized that
I have some follow-up questions.

34:02.070 --> 34:04.960
Really?
Well,where is your camera crew?

34:06.400 --> 34:09.000
I-I just--I have to find my tape recorder.

34:09.050 --> 34:11.949
You know,I'm getting a little tired
of your obvious assumption

34:12.000 --> 34:15.310
that just because I come from a town
that worships artichokes,I must be an idiot.

34:16.860 --> 34:19.489
I... I don't think you're an idiot.

34:19.929 --> 34:22.320
Then please stop treating me like one.

34:22.949 --> 34:26.360
I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm sorry. It's--it'S...

34:27.250 --> 34:28.880
I'M...

34:30.159 --> 34:32.550
seeing senator mccallister.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.380
So you're a "full-service" staff
member is what you're saying.

34:36.429 --> 34:38.850
I-I like to think of myself
as his girlfriend--

34:38.889 --> 34:42.020
overly neurotic girlfriend--
yes,but still his...

34:42.080 --> 34:45.949
anyway,it's--it's just,
I called him tonight,

34:46.030 --> 34:51.699
and he just--he got all weird
when he heard your name.

34:51.770 --> 34:55.770
And you were already thinking
there was some bad history there.

34:55.840 --> 34:59.980
Well,it's--it's just that you
worship the ground he walks on,

35:00.030 --> 35:04.280
and I just--in my experience,
men are a lot more disappointing than that.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.880
I got pregnant.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.650
It wasn't his.

35:13.200 --> 35:19.060
It would have had to have been an immaculate
conception for it to have been his.

35:21.230 --> 35:25.090
And he helped me...

35:25.820 --> 35:27.830
convinced me to have the child,

35:27.890 --> 35:29.720
put it up for adoption.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.490
He drove me to my aunt's house in colorado,

35:31.550 --> 35:34.250
where I stayed for a while.

35:35.570 --> 35:37.900
He was only 17 years old,

35:38.340 --> 35:41.510
and he did that for a baby that wasn't his

35:41.570 --> 35:43.920
and a girlfriend who cheated on him.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.980
Do I worship the ground robert
mccallister walks on,Ms. Walker?

35:52.260 --> 35:54.310
Not nearly enough.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.530
Juliet,what's the matter?

36:06.630 --> 36:09.830
Oh,please Nora,
I just need you let me be along.

36:10.670 --> 36:12.260
Juliet,I love your story.

36:12.330 --> 36:15.280
I think you'er talented,you just have to go on.

36:15.330 --> 36:20.020
-11111111
-22222222

36:27.820 --> 36:31.340
We've been sleep together for like a month.
He just told me in.

36:31.400 --> 36:36.200
E me siente en su clase?
It's so humiliating.

36:37.620 --> 36:41.350
Yeah.I bet.

36:41.430 --> 36:45.680
"She heard the splash quietly
over every other sound in her life--

36:45.730 --> 36:47.120
"over the children,

36:47.160 --> 36:49.600
"over the sounds of presents being unwrapped.

36:49.660 --> 36:51.950
"She heard the splash from the pool,

36:52.010 --> 36:56.640
and she knew that someone
and something had died."

37:00.690 --> 37:02.120
I don't know,nora.

37:02.910 --> 37:04.130
It's,uh...

37:06.270 --> 37:08.040
it's a little confused.

37:09.190 --> 37:12.060
I mean,you're a writer. We know that.

37:12.140 --> 37:13.490
But as the voice of the author,

37:13.540 --> 37:17.570
it's very important to decide
if you want to be credible,

37:17.600 --> 37:22.900
a reliable narrator,
somebody that the reader can trust or not,

37:22.950 --> 37:25.440
you know,as a truth teller.

37:25.500 --> 37:30.340
A-a little bit like how we have to
decide whether to believe you or not.

37:30.390 --> 37:31.410
What?

37:31.470 --> 37:35.410
I mean,are you mark august
the aging literary bad boy,

37:35.470 --> 37:40.040
or mark august the slightly long-in-the-tooth
enfant terrible of letters,

37:40.090 --> 37:43.160
or mark august the nurturing academic,

37:43.220 --> 37:49.140
or mark august the disingenuous
L.A. Casanova/pedophile?

37:49.380 --> 37:51.380
Why don't we go out in the hall for a minute?

37:51.440 --> 37:52.800
Fine.

38:00.270 --> 38:03.060
oh,boy,you are really something.

38:03.130 --> 38:05.090
You know,I don't understand
what I did wrong here.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.950
You're sleeping with poor little juliet?

38:08.010 --> 38:10.400
-Wait a second.Wait a second.
-My god,she's 12 years old!

38:10.460 --> 38:11.990
-Okay,wait!
-What?

38:12.050 --> 38:14.910
-"A," yes,we went out a coup of times,okay?
-Oh,yeah,I bet.

38:14.990 --> 38:20.510
And frankly I'm not all that interested
in hearing about the travails of growing
up lonely in malibu anymore

38:20.570 --> 38:23.150
-Right.
-And "b," I never promised you anything.

38:23.220 --> 38:26.110
-I don't want anything!
-I invited you to a dull faculty party,

38:26.160 --> 38:28.740
so I'm not sure what all the outrage is for,

38:28.800 --> 38:32.320
-except that I find it wildly sexy.
-Oh,please,I--

38:32.800 --> 38:35.150
-you find it sexy?
-Yup.

38:35.220 --> 38:37.790
Oh,no,no,no,no.
I'm not going there again.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.880
And what are you gonna do
about poor little juliet?

38:39.920 --> 38:41.970
I'm gonna teach her
how to write a coherent sentence.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.790
Oh,is that what they're calling it nowadays?

38:43.840 --> 38:46.470
-Which is between her and me,frankly.
-Uh-huh.

38:46.510 --> 38:49.670
But you,on the other hand,
are an entirely different story.

38:49.740 --> 38:53.330
Look,you know,you're smart,
and you're funny,

38:53.390 --> 38:57.040
and I'm--
I sort of can't stop thinking about you,

38:57.090 --> 38:59.290
which is where we are here.

38:59.660 --> 39:03.660
So...do you have plans for dinner?

39:05.520 --> 39:08.870
-Dinner? Are you nuts?
-Yeah.

39:09.410 --> 39:11.990
How was,uh,the rest of
your trip to castroville?

39:12.040 --> 39:15.340
-Did you try the ar-ti-rita?
-No. Oh,no,no.

39:15.400 --> 39:19.590
I-I didn't drink at all,
acally,not even a-a drop,

39:19.640 --> 39:23.240
but I,you know,I did go there thinking that
if I could find any dirt on you at all,

39:23.320 --> 39:25.030
it would be buried
in your hometown,and then--

39:25.100 --> 39:27.140
you can bury dirt?
How does that work exactly?

39:27.190 --> 39:29.820
But instead I find out that
I'm really screwed up here,

39:29.870 --> 39:32.620
because I'm falling in love with a saint.

39:32.850 --> 39:34.280
You what?

39:34.580 --> 39:36.280
Mm,nothing.I...

39:36.340 --> 39:40.450
No,I just said that you're this incredibly
perfect saintlike saint.

39:40.500 --> 39:44.100
Well,most saints are saintlike,kitty,but
we'll get to that in a minute.You're what?

39:44.470 --> 39:47.940
oh,I just said that
I was falling in love with you.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.280
During the rescue...

39:58.190 --> 39:59.880
on the helicopter...

40:01.620 --> 40:04.190
I don't remember what really happened.

40:07.770 --> 40:09.440
It was bad.

40:10.180 --> 40:13.060
We were taking heavy fire.
Guys were gettin' hit.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.820
I remember calling off the extraction.

40:17.070 --> 40:18.880
But my copilot,

40:19.420 --> 40:21.190
he wanted to stay.

40:22.610 --> 40:24.280
It was happening very fast,

40:24.340 --> 40:30.280
and then we went down,
and he was killed.I blacked out.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.260
Kitty,it's all a blur.

40:35.330 --> 40:39.250
But the last thing I do remember
was trying to get the hell out of there.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.510
And then I just...

40:45.740 --> 40:47.980
I let people believe what they wanted...

40:49.070 --> 40:50.900
that I was a hero.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.820
But I wasn'T.

40:54.570 --> 40:56.120
I'm not.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.770
I'm not even close.

40:58.810 --> 41:02.080
*please don't cry...*

41:02.150 --> 41:03.800
and yeah...

41:04.610 --> 41:08.820
yeah... I love you,too.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.200
it is my honor to present to you
the future 44th president of the united states--

41:14.250 --> 41:17.810
senator robert alexander mccallister!

41:18.820 --> 41:23.490
*there will always be a light*

41:24.980 --> 41:29.780
*everything will be OKey*
good luck,sir.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.080
Thank you.

41:31.150 --> 41:32.510
Thank you very much.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.360
Ladies and gentlemen,fellow veterans,

41:35.410 --> 41:39.640
tonight I ask you all to enlist in a mission
that is bigger than any of us...
