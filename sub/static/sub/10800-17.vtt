WEBVTT

00:02.194 --> 00:06.130
Captain's Log, Stardate 44631.2.

00:06.164 --> 00:08.029
We are proceeding
through the rim

00:08.066 --> 00:10.034
of an uncharted
binary star system

00:10.068 --> 00:12.730
where we may have located
the USS Brittain. 

00:12.771 --> 00:15.535
The missing science vessel
failed to arrive

00:15.574 --> 00:18.543
at its destination
and has not been heard from

00:18.577 --> 00:20.841
since a distress call,
29 days ago.

00:20.879 --> 00:21.868
On screen.

00:21.913 --> 00:23.403
Magnify.

00:24.683 --> 00:26.344
That's the Brittain,  all right.

00:26.385 --> 00:27.613
The ship is intact, sir

00:27.653 --> 00:29.712
with no indication
of structural damage.

00:29.755 --> 00:30.722
Engines?

00:30.756 --> 00:32.747
All propulsion
systems are shut down.

00:32.791 --> 00:34.691
The ship is drifting, sir.

00:34.726 --> 00:36.455
Life-form readings?

00:36.495 --> 00:38.156
Inconclusive.

00:38.196 --> 00:40.027
Counselor?

00:40.065 --> 00:42.761
There is life on board, but...

00:44.403 --> 00:46.428
What is it?

00:46.471 --> 00:48.939
I don't know.

00:48.974 --> 00:51.067
Something...

00:52.878 --> 00:54.641
Number One, assemble your team.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.706
Dr. Crusher, report
to Transporter Room Three.

00:57.749 --> 00:59.478
Worf. Data.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.951
Commander.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.553
I need to come, too.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.980 --> 01:33.178
There is no malfunction
in any of the main systems, sir.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.466
Commander.

01:49.601 --> 01:51.694
Here's another one.

01:51.737 --> 01:55.366
This was done by a phaser
on a setting of six or seven.

01:59.177 --> 02:01.202
And more over here.

02:03.515 --> 02:05.608
The entire Bridge crew.

02:07.119 --> 02:09.144
Whoever did this
could still be on the ship.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.846
There is someone still alive

02:10.889 --> 02:13.756
but he didn't kill these people.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.020
Here.

02:22.801 --> 02:24.928
I think he's Betazoid.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.096
It's all right.

02:26.138 --> 02:27.833
We're going to help you.

02:31.343 --> 02:33.174
Who did this?

02:33.211 --> 02:35.202
Who did this to you?

03:04.755 --> 03:09.124
Space, the final frontier.

03:09.193 --> 03:13.027
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise. 

03:13.063 --> 03:15.031
Its continuing mission...

03:15.065 --> 03:19.001
to explore strange new worlds

03:19.036 --> 03:23.473
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

03:23.507 --> 03:28.001
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:31.974 --> 04:34.408
We've almost finished
the autopsies, Captain.

04:34.443 --> 04:36.377
How long will it take
to compile the data?

04:36.412 --> 04:37.811
It's complicated.

04:37.846 --> 04:40.246
The dead were found
all over the ship.

04:40.282 --> 04:43.410
Some were found locked
in their rooms, barricaded

04:43.452 --> 04:45.682
with weapons piled
all around them.

04:45.721 --> 04:47.382
Others were found
in the corridors

04:47.423 --> 04:50.483
where they'd obviously
had hand-to-hand combat.

04:50.526 --> 04:52.118
It's going to take some time

04:52.194 --> 04:54.594
to analyze and sort
through the details.

04:54.630 --> 04:58.657
We've identified him
as Andrus Hagen from Betazed.

04:58.701 --> 05:00.293
Scientific advisor.

05:00.336 --> 05:03.499
He's in a profound
catatonic state.

05:03.539 --> 05:05.871
I'm not getting much, Captain.

05:05.908 --> 05:09.537
A few words,
disconnected phrases.

05:09.578 --> 05:11.546
I can feel his terror

05:11.580 --> 05:14.845
but I can't seem
to get through to him.

05:14.883 --> 05:17.078
Stay with him, Counselor.

05:17.152 --> 05:20.053
We're examining
the Brittain for clues

05:20.089 --> 05:22.080
but this is the only man left

05:22.157 --> 05:24.318
who knows what happened there.

05:25.894 --> 05:27.725
I'm here. 

05:27.763 --> 05:30.323
I'm right here. 

05:30.366 --> 05:33.267
Out there... 

05:33.302 --> 05:35.600
voices... 

05:35.638 --> 05:37.367
Voices? 

05:37.406 --> 05:39.567
What do they say? 

05:39.608 --> 05:41.473
Both things... 

05:41.510 --> 05:44.946
no... no... 

05:46.548 --> 05:48.516
Keep talking to me. 

05:48.550 --> 05:51.018
I'll try to understand. 

06:00.529 --> 06:02.656
All the engines check out
perfectly, Commander.

06:02.698 --> 06:04.256
Once we get them started

06:04.300 --> 06:06.825
the Brittain can get back to
Starbase under her own power.

06:06.869 --> 06:08.359
Let's give it a try.

06:09.805 --> 06:11.966
Preheating injectors.

06:12.007 --> 06:13.599
Data, fuel flow?

06:13.642 --> 06:17.203
Matter valves are open
and operating.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.875
Magnetic containment
of antimatter pods is constant.

06:20.916 --> 06:22.781
Okay, open injectors.

06:22.818 --> 06:24.649
Injectors open.

06:31.427 --> 06:33.588
There is no engine activity
at all, sir.

06:33.629 --> 06:35.062
What's wrong?

06:35.097 --> 06:36.894
Nothing's wrong.

06:36.932 --> 06:39.264
I don't understand it.

06:42.037 --> 06:44.028
Come.

06:46.608 --> 06:49.475
I've been studying
the autopsy reports.

06:49.511 --> 06:51.604
The conclusion is appalling.

06:51.647 --> 06:53.672
There was no outside source.

06:53.716 --> 06:55.240
No alien presence.

06:55.284 --> 06:59.653
All 34 of them appear
to have killed each other.

06:59.688 --> 07:01.622
What could have caused
such an event?

07:01.657 --> 07:02.783
Drugs?

07:02.825 --> 07:04.622
A virus? Poison?

07:04.660 --> 07:06.252
Toxicological tests

07:06.295 --> 07:08.763
showed no unusual substances
in their systems

07:08.797 --> 07:10.992
and they all appear
to be in good health

07:11.033 --> 07:12.557
but, for whatever reason

07:12.601 --> 07:15.263
they seemed to turn
against each other

07:15.304 --> 07:18.865
using phasers and knives
and bare hands.

07:18.907 --> 07:21.933
I'd like you to see this,
Captain.

07:21.977 --> 07:24.468
It's from the logs
of the Brittain. 

07:24.513 --> 07:26.913
Captain Zaheva's
mental condition

07:26.949 --> 07:30.783
deteriorated steadily
once they had become stranded.

07:30.819 --> 07:33.686
She began talking
of plots and mutinies.

07:33.722 --> 07:36.190
This was the last entry
in the log

07:36.225 --> 07:39.592
made after they had been adrift
for over three weeks.

07:39.628 --> 07:44.361
First Officer Brink
and his men were behind it.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.267
They got to the engines.

07:47.302 --> 07:50.430
They don't work anymore.

07:50.472 --> 07:53.407
Had to eliminate Brink.

07:53.442 --> 07:55.706
The ship is out of...

07:55.744 --> 07:57.439
out of...

07:57.479 --> 07:59.777
We're running out...

07:59.815 --> 08:02.283
Too dangerous...

08:02.317 --> 08:03.648
Out of Brink...

08:03.685 --> 08:05.448
and his men...

08:20.302 --> 08:23.203
Eyes... 

08:23.238 --> 08:24.535
in the dark... 

08:26.909 --> 08:30.345
One moon... 

08:33.115 --> 08:35.174
Where are you?

08:39.755 --> 08:42.417
I'm coming.
Where are you?

08:46.428 --> 08:49.363
Eyes... 

08:49.398 --> 08:51.866
in the dark... 

08:51.900 --> 08:54.460
One moon... 

08:56.505 --> 08:58.666
Eyes... 

08:58.707 --> 08:59.799
in the dark... 

08:59.842 --> 09:01.434
One moon... 

09:01.477 --> 09:03.001
circles... 

09:04.046 --> 09:05.741
See the eyes... 

09:05.781 --> 09:07.408
in the dark... 

09:07.449 --> 09:08.848
One moon... 

09:08.884 --> 09:10.442
Where are you?!

09:10.486 --> 09:13.284
... in the dark... 

09:13.322 --> 09:15.085
One moon... 

09:28.421 --> 09:32.221
Captain's Log, Stardate 44635.8.

09:32.258 --> 09:33.316
Four days have passed

09:33.359 --> 09:34.986
but we have made
little progress

09:35.028 --> 09:37.394
in solving the mystery
of the Brittain. 

09:37.430 --> 09:40.490
I have decided we should return
to Starbase 220.

09:40.533 --> 09:43.161
And to that end,
Commander La Forge is rigging

09:43.202 --> 09:44.635
the Brittain for towing.

09:44.671 --> 09:50.439
I'm going to try recalibrating
the field generators.

09:52.278 --> 09:53.438
I still don't see

09:53.479 --> 09:55.379
why we can't get
the engines started.

09:55.415 --> 09:59.249
It just doesn't make any sense.

10:06.459 --> 10:07.653
Someone's still here.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.093
What did you say, Ensign?

10:09.162 --> 10:12.029
Can't you hear it?

10:12.065 --> 10:15.262
There's someone still alive
on the ship.

10:21.174 --> 10:22.766
I heard...

10:22.809 --> 10:24.470
I...

10:24.510 --> 10:28.708
I mean, I thought
I heard something.

10:28.748 --> 10:30.773
The ship was searched
thoroughly.

10:30.817 --> 10:32.785
There's nobody left on board.

10:32.819 --> 10:34.582
Sorry, sir.

10:34.621 --> 10:36.384
My mistake.

10:36.422 --> 10:38.049
Don't worry about it.

10:38.091 --> 10:41.356
There were 34 people found dead
on this ship.

10:41.394 --> 10:44.124
That's enough
to make anybody uneasy.

10:44.163 --> 10:46.996
Thank you, sir.

10:51.671 --> 10:53.798
I'm here. 

10:55.375 --> 10:57.434
Can you hear me? 

11:00.279 --> 11:04.841
Tell me about
the voices you hear. 

11:04.884 --> 11:06.909
Bright... 

11:06.953 --> 11:08.250
bright... 

11:08.287 --> 11:10.778
out there... 

11:12.659 --> 11:14.627
I don't understand. 

11:14.661 --> 11:16.652
Bright what? 

11:16.696 --> 11:18.960
Tell me more. 

11:30.777 --> 11:33.041
Boy, what a day this was.

11:33.079 --> 11:36.708
I'm doing an isozyme study
on some populations of Cardilia

11:36.749 --> 11:37.943
but they're turning out

11:37.984 --> 11:40.111
to have these really weird
polymorphisms.

11:40.153 --> 11:42.121
What a headache.

11:42.188 --> 11:44.122
Is that why you're late?

11:44.223 --> 11:46.953
Oh, no, I had a conference
with Dr. Balthus.

11:46.993 --> 11:50.121
She wants to do a study
on the laticifer ontogeny

11:50.196 --> 11:51.595
of the Kaladian thorn flower

11:51.631 --> 11:54.566
but I don't have time
to oversee another project.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.124
Was Tom Corbin there?

11:56.235 --> 11:57.395
What?

11:57.437 --> 11:59.871
Tom Corbin...
from the Science Lab.

11:59.906 --> 12:01.100
Remember him?

12:01.140 --> 12:02.903
Of course,
I remember him, but...

12:02.942 --> 12:05.240
You use any excuse you
can to pay him a visit.

12:05.278 --> 12:07.269
Miles, what are you saying?

12:07.313 --> 12:09.713
I think you know
exactly what I'm saying.

12:12.118 --> 12:15.554
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were jealous.

12:17.557 --> 12:19.616
You take me for a fool.

12:29.135 --> 12:30.534
Hello, Chief.

12:31.771 --> 12:33.261
Having coffee?

12:33.306 --> 12:35.740
No, I'm drinking
too much coffee.

12:35.775 --> 12:37.766
Kind of a surprise
to see you here at this hour.

12:37.810 --> 12:39.107
Yeah? Why is that?

12:39.145 --> 12:41.113
Not out of the honeymoon yet.

12:41.180 --> 12:44.274
Usually, newlyweds can't keep
their hands off each other.

12:44.317 --> 12:45.716
She has work to do.

12:45.752 --> 12:48.084
She heads up the plant
biology lab, you know?

12:48.121 --> 12:51.921
Any strange things
going on down there?

12:51.958 --> 12:53.892
Like what?

12:55.328 --> 12:57.125
I've been hearing things.

12:57.163 --> 12:58.721
Kenicki, in Engineering

12:58.765 --> 13:02.030
told me he saw a man
in an old Starfleet uniform

13:02.068 --> 13:04.536
riding the lift
near the engine core.

13:04.570 --> 13:08.199
When the lift got to the top,
there was no one on it.

13:08.241 --> 13:09.902
- Ghost stories.
- There's more.

13:09.942 --> 13:11.307
There's lots more.

13:11.344 --> 13:14.074
There are strange things
happening on this ship, O'Brien.

13:14.113 --> 13:16.081
I'm surprised at you, Gillespie.

13:16.115 --> 13:17.377
A Starfleet officer?

13:17.416 --> 13:22.149
I have more things to worry
about than shades and spirits.

13:29.128 --> 13:30.459
Come.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.098
Come!

13:46.512 --> 13:48.480
Yes, yes.

14:17.643 --> 14:19.270
Come.

14:21.214 --> 14:22.943
What...?

14:24.584 --> 14:26.984
Captain, do you have a moment?

14:27.019 --> 14:28.077
We're concerned.

14:28.154 --> 14:30.019
We're afraid whatever happened

14:30.056 --> 14:32.422
on the Brittain
may be starting here.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.789
Explain.

14:33.826 --> 14:38.354
Well, Beverly and I have been
getting unusual reports.

14:38.397 --> 14:39.489
People behaving strangely.

14:39.532 --> 14:42.592
Others hearing sounds
that aren't there.

14:42.635 --> 14:44.398
Are we talking
about hallucinations?

14:44.437 --> 14:45.563
In some cases.

14:45.605 --> 14:47.402
In others,
just erratic behavior.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.668
We can't track down

14:48.708 --> 14:51.199
any element
that might be responsible.

14:51.244 --> 14:53.212
But everything started
when we found the Brittain. 

14:53.246 --> 14:54.736
Yes.

14:54.780 --> 14:57.977
Captain, we have to get
the Enterprise away from here

14:58.017 --> 15:00.577
before it gets any worse.

15:02.021 --> 15:03.921
We're preparing
to take the Brittain in tow.

15:03.956 --> 15:05.890
We'll be on our way
within the hour.

15:11.964 --> 15:15.456
Ensign, maneuver us
into tractor beam range.

15:15.501 --> 15:17.526
Aye, sir.

15:23.109 --> 15:24.770
Is there a problem, Ensign?

15:24.810 --> 15:26.869
I... can't seem to remember

15:26.913 --> 15:29.575
how to enter
the coordinates, sir.

15:29.615 --> 15:30.912
Ensign Lin.

15:30.950 --> 15:32.417
Ready now, Captain.

15:32.451 --> 15:35.784
Report to Sick Bay,
Ensign Rager.

15:35.821 --> 15:39.313
Ready tractor beam, Mr. Worf.

15:39.358 --> 15:42.384
Captain,
thrusters are losing power.

15:42.428 --> 15:45.886
Impulse engines...
ahead minimum power.

15:45.932 --> 15:49.333
Impulse engines
are not responding, sir.

15:49.368 --> 15:51.268
Geordi, what's going on
down there?

15:51.304 --> 15:52.498
I don't know, sir.

15:52.538 --> 15:53.664
Nothing's responding.

15:53.706 --> 15:56.038
Go to warp engines, factor one.

15:56.075 --> 15:57.201
Engage.

15:57.243 --> 15:58.369
Captain

15:58.411 --> 16:00.208
we don't have warp drive,
either.

16:02.148 --> 16:04.378
We have no functional
propulsion systems?

16:04.417 --> 16:05.611
No, sir.

16:05.651 --> 16:07.209
Apparently, we do not.

16:07.253 --> 16:08.550
We're adrift.

16:08.587 --> 16:10.748
Just like the Brittain. 

16:17.771 --> 16:21.571
Captain's Log, Stardate 44639.9.

16:21.608 --> 16:25.237
The Enterprise has now been
adrift for a total of ten days.

16:25.278 --> 16:27.644
We have sent subspace
distress calls

16:27.681 --> 16:30.309
but because
of our distant location

16:30.350 --> 16:33.478
we cannot expect a response
for at least another two weeks.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.681
After analyzing the sensor logs

16:35.722 --> 16:37.349
of the Brittain
and the Enterprise

16:37.390 --> 16:40.723
as well as the data
from the last series of probes

16:40.760 --> 16:42.785
I conclude
that we have become trapped

16:42.829 --> 16:44.319
in a massive rupture in space

16:44.364 --> 16:46.298
into which energy is absorbed.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.733
You mean a Tyken's Rift?

16:48.768 --> 16:49.928
A what?

16:49.970 --> 16:52.404
A rare anomaly,
named after Bela Tyken

16:52.439 --> 16:55.704
a Melthusian captain
who first encountered it.

16:55.742 --> 16:57.039
Tyken's Rift.

16:57.077 --> 16:59.705
That would explain
why we don't have engine power.

16:59.746 --> 17:01.338
The ship's energy
is being drained

17:01.381 --> 17:03.474
into the fissure
before we can utilize it.

17:08.821 --> 17:10.585
I was detained.

17:10.624 --> 17:13.218
When Tyken was trapped
in the rift

17:13.260 --> 17:17.424
his analysis determined
that a massive energy release

17:17.464 --> 17:20.592
might overload
and dislocate the anomaly.

17:20.634 --> 17:23.898
Fortunately, his cargo included
anicium and yurium

17:23.936 --> 17:26.234
which he used to detonate
the explosion.

17:26.272 --> 17:29.606
He then escaped through
the ruptured center of the rift.

17:29.643 --> 17:30.905
But we aren't carrying anything

17:30.944 --> 17:32.844
that could produce
that kind of an explosion.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.813
Not even our photon torpedoes
would be enough.

17:34.848 --> 17:37.908
Couldn't we replicate
the elements that Tyken used?

17:37.951 --> 17:39.919
No, sir.
We no longer have the power

17:39.953 --> 17:42.615
to reproduce complex elements
in the replicator.

17:42.656 --> 17:45.648
We must find a way to generate
a violent energy release

17:45.692 --> 17:47.785
without using
conventional means.

17:47.827 --> 17:49.886
Data, in Tyken's experience

17:49.930 --> 17:53.161
did the crew exhibit
behavioral changes?

17:53.200 --> 17:56.692
No. There were no reports of
unusual conduct among the crew.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.067
What about nightmares?

17:58.104 --> 17:59.366
There were no records

17:59.406 --> 18:01.601
of sleep disturbances
of any kind, Counselor.

18:01.641 --> 18:03.233
Then...

18:03.276 --> 18:05.403
what is it?

18:05.445 --> 18:07.470
What's happening to us?

18:10.750 --> 18:13.776
The only one who doesn't seem
affected by all this is Data.

18:17.724 --> 18:20.022
Bridge.

18:20.060 --> 18:23.826
Number One, how...?

18:23.863 --> 18:25.455
Sir?

18:26.900 --> 18:28.959
Any hallucinations?

18:29.002 --> 18:30.594
Nightmares?

18:30.637 --> 18:32.571
No.

18:32.606 --> 18:35.939
I'd be a liar if I said
I felt like myself.

18:35.976 --> 18:37.034
I've had to bite my tongue

18:37.143 --> 18:39.771
to keep from snapping
at people.

18:39.813 --> 18:43.271
Couple of times,
I've gone to my quarters

18:43.316 --> 18:46.251
and felt as if there was
someone else in there

18:46.286 --> 18:48.117
waiting for me.

18:49.489 --> 18:52.720
I've had similar feelings.

18:52.759 --> 18:54.556
With everyone succumbing

18:54.594 --> 18:58.394
it's even more important
that one of us attempt

18:58.431 --> 19:01.059
to keep control
of his faculties.

19:01.101 --> 19:03.160
I want you to turn in,
take a nap.

19:03.203 --> 19:04.830
I'll be on the Bridge.

19:04.871 --> 19:06.998
You can relieve me
in four hours.

19:07.107 --> 19:08.870
Yes, sir.

19:08.908 --> 19:10.773
Deck eight.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.503
No!

20:20.680 --> 20:22.511
Sir?

20:39.866 --> 20:41.857
As you were.

20:49.576 --> 20:52.636
Mr. Data, will you join
me in my ready room?

21:40.827 --> 21:43.091
Commander La Forge
and I have come up

21:43.163 --> 21:45.654
with a potential solution
to our predicament.

21:45.698 --> 21:48.360
Perhaps the modifications
used to increase firepower

21:48.401 --> 21:50.528
against the Borg would
be effective here.

21:52.405 --> 21:54.396
Channeling power to the main...

21:54.441 --> 21:56.773
um... deflector dish.

21:56.810 --> 21:57.936
Yes, sir.

21:57.977 --> 21:59.945
I believe that within six hours

21:59.979 --> 22:03.437
we could generate
a concentrated burst of energy

22:03.483 --> 22:07.214
which might disrupt
the Tyken's Rift.

22:07.253 --> 22:09.585
Very well. Proceed.

22:09.622 --> 22:11.715
Mr. Data.

22:11.758 --> 22:13.988
Yes, sir?

22:14.027 --> 22:17.053
It appears that I am not immune

22:17.163 --> 22:21.065
to the strange forces
that are at work on this ship.

22:21.167 --> 22:24.034
Yes, sir.

22:24.070 --> 22:27.562
It's a terrifying prospect,
to lose control of one's mind.

22:30.343 --> 22:33.005
When I was young

22:33.046 --> 22:37.312
I remember watching
my grandfather deteriorate

22:37.350 --> 22:40.842
from a powerful,
intelligent figure

22:40.887 --> 22:45.290
to a frail wisp of a man

22:45.325 --> 22:48.419
who could barely make
his own way home.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.763
Mr. Data,
it is my responsibility...

22:53.800 --> 22:57.793
somehow... to see that this ship
is guided to safety.

22:59.873 --> 23:02.637
I will need to rely on you
from now on.

23:05.745 --> 23:08.771
We may need to count on you
for our very survival.

23:08.815 --> 23:11.306
I will do my best, sir.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.350
I'd like to do
more cross sections

23:17.390 --> 23:19.620
on the brain tissue
of some of these bodies.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.025
Set up the positron emission
sensor in Sick Bay

23:22.061 --> 23:24.256
and I'll decide
which ones I want to study.

23:24.297 --> 23:25.821
Yes, Doctor.

24:21.921 --> 24:24.981
Go away.

24:37.692 --> 24:40.559
Captain, let me ask you this.

24:40.595 --> 24:42.825
Since we located the Brittain

24:42.864 --> 24:45.731
can you remember
any of your dreams?

24:48.002 --> 24:49.799
I hardly ever recall dreams.

24:49.837 --> 24:52.704
Most people don't, but think!

24:52.740 --> 24:56.733
Have you even had a dream
in the last ten days?

24:58.346 --> 24:59.608
I don't recall.

24:59.647 --> 25:02.275
I'm willing to bet you haven't.

25:02.316 --> 25:05.843
What's more, neither has
anyone else on board this ship

25:05.887 --> 25:08.412
except for Troi.

25:08.456 --> 25:09.684
I began to realize that

25:09.724 --> 25:12.921
when she talked about
having nightmares.

25:15.863 --> 25:17.353
I've, uh...

25:17.398 --> 25:18.990
done some...

25:19.100 --> 25:23.161
additional brain tissue scans
on, uh, the bodies...

25:23.204 --> 25:25.672
some of the bodies
from the, uh...

25:25.706 --> 25:27.003
the...

25:27.108 --> 25:28.200
The Brittain,  Doctor.

25:28.242 --> 25:29.368
Right, and uh...

25:29.410 --> 25:30.877
I've also done some scans

25:30.912 --> 25:33.346
on a random cross
section from our crew.

25:33.381 --> 25:36.475
They both have
the same results...

25:36.517 --> 25:39.179
a unique chemical imbalance.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.017
Caused by?

25:41.122 --> 25:43.113
Dream deprivation.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.449
Every night

25:46.494 --> 25:49.224
when we...

25:49.263 --> 25:50.730
we...

25:50.765 --> 25:53.165
enter into...

25:53.201 --> 25:55.226
sleep...

25:56.871 --> 25:58.805
I believe what the Doctor means

25:58.840 --> 26:04.540
is that humans enter into
what is known as REM sleep...

26:04.579 --> 26:06.274
rapid eye movement.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.975
It is the level
of brain-wave activity

26:08.082 --> 26:09.845
at which one dreams.

26:09.884 --> 26:13.217
We have to dream
in order to survive.

26:13.254 --> 26:17.554
If we don't reach REM sleep,
we don't dream.

26:17.592 --> 26:20.390
We-we begin to lose
our cognitive abilities.

26:20.428 --> 26:22.726
We find it hard to concentrate.

26:22.763 --> 26:26.460
We forget how to do
the most ordinary task.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.833
Then we become
irritable, paranoid.

26:29.871 --> 26:33.136
Some people experience
hallucinations.

26:33.174 --> 26:36.769
You're describing
the situation on this ship

26:36.811 --> 26:40.303
but Counselor Troi
reported nightmares.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.908
Maybe it's because
she's Betazoid.

26:42.950 --> 26:45.009
I don't know why.

26:45.052 --> 26:47.919
All I know is that
there's more going on here

26:47.955 --> 26:50.617
than being caught
in a Tyken's Rift

26:50.658 --> 26:54.025
and I don't know
how or why it's happening.

26:54.061 --> 26:56.723
But I do know this...

26:56.764 --> 27:00.791
there is an inevitable
conclusion to this pattern

27:00.835 --> 27:03.804
and if I can't find
a way to stop it

27:03.838 --> 27:07.035
we will all go insane.

27:27.635 --> 27:29.569
Eyes... 

27:29.603 --> 27:30.763
in the dark. 

27:30.804 --> 27:32.567
One moon circles. 

27:32.606 --> 27:35.097
Where are you?

27:36.443 --> 27:39.344
Eyes... in the dark. 

27:39.380 --> 27:43.339
One moon circles. 

27:48.589 --> 27:50.580
I'm still here. 

27:50.624 --> 27:53.286
I haven't gone anywhere. 

27:55.462 --> 27:58.056
Do you remember anything more? 

28:00.367 --> 28:02.426
Double... 

28:02.469 --> 28:04.767
double... 

28:04.805 --> 28:08.536
What does that mean? 

28:08.575 --> 28:11.510
Is something doubled? 

28:28.295 --> 28:31.458
Deanna, nothing's working.

28:31.498 --> 28:33.329
I've tried somatic drugs.

28:33.367 --> 28:36.359
I've tried inducing theta waves
into the entorhinal cortex.

28:36.403 --> 28:40.669
No matter what I do,
no one can reach REM sleep.

28:40.708 --> 28:45.577
No one can dream...
except for you.

28:49.216 --> 28:52.151
Except me...

28:52.186 --> 28:56.247
and all I have is nightmares.

28:56.290 --> 28:59.521
I can hardly sleep
at all anymore.

29:01.362 --> 29:05.458
In the end, I'll be like him.

29:05.499 --> 29:08.400
Just like him.

29:10.404 --> 29:12.770
Well, I think it's some kind
of experiment.

29:12.806 --> 29:14.205
Oh, what do you know about...?

29:14.241 --> 29:16.072
You see, Captain Picard
is trying to see

29:16.110 --> 29:19.739
how long we'll take it,
stuck here like rats.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.680
Oh, you couldn't be
more wrong.

29:21.715 --> 29:24.411
It's like we're
laboratory animals.

29:24.451 --> 29:27.181
I don't want to sit here
and wait

29:27.221 --> 29:29.189
for death to sneak up behind me.

29:29.223 --> 29:30.747
What's that supposed to mean?

29:30.791 --> 29:32.782
You heard about them
on the Brittain... 

29:32.826 --> 29:34.555
shut in their rooms,
dying alone.

29:34.595 --> 29:35.823
That's not for me.

29:35.863 --> 29:36.955
Not for me, either.

29:37.064 --> 29:39.259
I'd rather go out fighting.

29:43.137 --> 29:46.231
Okay, all power
has been channeled

29:46.273 --> 29:48.241
to the, um...

29:48.275 --> 29:49.367
the...

29:49.410 --> 29:51.571
The main deflector dish.

29:51.612 --> 29:54.604
Yes, right, the deflector dish.

29:54.648 --> 29:58.243
So, uh...

29:58.285 --> 30:00.719
what do we do now?

30:00.754 --> 30:02.278
Data to Bridge.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.620
Mr. Worf, activate
the deflector.

30:04.658 --> 30:05.955
Aye, sir.

30:08.495 --> 30:11.464
Deflector power banks
approaching maximum.

30:11.498 --> 30:13.830
Discharge in 15 seconds.

30:13.867 --> 30:16.461
Data, this detonation
better work.

30:16.503 --> 30:18.664
We're not going
to last much longer.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.399
Discharge in three seconds.

30:22.443 --> 30:24.741
Two, one.

30:28.782 --> 30:29.749
Nothing.

30:29.783 --> 30:31.410
It just fizzled out.

30:31.452 --> 30:33.716
Captain, it appears
the energy output

30:33.754 --> 30:35.381
has been absorbed into the rift.

30:35.422 --> 30:37.390
Data, can we try again?

30:37.424 --> 30:38.482
No, sir.

30:38.525 --> 30:39.685
If we draw more power

30:39.726 --> 30:42.024
we risk losing
life-support systems.

30:42.129 --> 30:43.323
Understood.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.422
Keep me apprised, Commander.

31:20.767 --> 31:24.134
lujpu'... 

31:24.171 --> 31:26.401
jiH'e... 

31:28.308 --> 31:30.674
Alexandrijn. 

31:32.880 --> 31:35.144
Worf, no!

31:35.182 --> 31:36.649
You will not stop me.

31:36.683 --> 31:39.208
Security, Worf's
quarters immediately.

31:39.253 --> 31:40.948
No one can stop me.

31:40.988 --> 31:42.012
Why?

31:42.122 --> 31:43.316
What is it?

31:49.997 --> 31:52.989
I am no longer a warrior.

31:53.033 --> 31:56.469
I am no longer strong.

31:58.305 --> 32:00.000
I...

32:00.040 --> 32:02.338
I feel...

32:02.376 --> 32:04.105
What?

32:05.646 --> 32:07.614
What do you feel?

32:10.684 --> 32:12.811
I feel fear.

32:15.189 --> 32:19.888
To admit that you are afraid
gives you strength.

32:19.927 --> 32:23.226
Something is waiting for us.

32:23.263 --> 32:26.130
I am not strong enough
to fight it.

32:26.166 --> 32:27.292
No, Worf.

32:27.334 --> 32:30.098
It's just an illusion.

32:30.137 --> 32:32.162
It's not real.

32:35.175 --> 32:36.767
Please

32:36.810 --> 32:39.506
put down the knife.

32:52.359 --> 32:53.553
Counselor?

32:53.594 --> 32:55.186
It's all right.

32:55.229 --> 32:57.493
Everything's fine.

32:57.531 --> 32:59.192
Thank you.

33:05.172 --> 33:07.470
Let me take you to Sick Bay.

33:35.030 --> 33:38.864
Acting Captain's Log,
Stardate 44642.1.

33:38.901 --> 33:41.426
I have assumed command
of the Enterprise

33:41.470 --> 33:43.631
at the request
of Captain Picard.

33:43.672 --> 33:45.936
Our situation is deteriorating.

33:45.974 --> 33:48.204
Many of the crew
are unable to function

33:48.243 --> 33:51.303
and our life-support systems
are beginning to falter.

33:52.514 --> 33:55.972
Once before, you said "double. "

33:56.051 --> 33:58.542
What did you mean? 

33:58.587 --> 33:59.713
What is "double"? 

33:59.755 --> 34:01.723
Mates...

34:01.757 --> 34:03.816
too bright... 

34:03.859 --> 34:05.724
twin... 

34:05.761 --> 34:08.252
cannot leave the twin. 

34:08.297 --> 34:10.788
One moon circling... 

34:10.831 --> 34:12.925
What do you mean? 

34:13.034 --> 34:14.935
You can't leave? 

34:15.036 --> 34:16.937
No, no. 

34:17.039 --> 34:20.371
Please... can't. 

34:20.409 --> 34:22.070
You want to leave. 

34:22.110 --> 34:23.804
Why can't you? 

34:23.844 --> 34:25.472
Can't go. 

34:25.514 --> 34:27.208
Help. 

34:27.248 --> 34:30.547
One moon... circling. 

34:30.585 --> 34:32.246
Eyes... 

34:32.286 --> 34:34.380
that's it. 

34:34.422 --> 34:36.391
Eyes... 

34:36.425 --> 34:38.393
in the dark. 

34:43.899 --> 34:46.333
"Eyes in the dark."

34:48.303 --> 34:50.965
That's what the voice said
in my dream.

34:51.072 --> 34:53.473
Is that where you heard it?

34:53.507 --> 34:56.306
In a dream? Over and over?

35:03.652 --> 35:05.882
Beverly, I know what it is.

35:05.921 --> 35:07.445
I know what's happening.

35:07.489 --> 35:09.116
What?

35:09.157 --> 35:10.784
My nightmare.

35:10.826 --> 35:12.157
It's not a dream.

35:12.194 --> 35:14.754
It's not a dream at all.
It's a message.

35:14.796 --> 35:18.357
REM sleep occurs
at a different frequency

35:18.400 --> 35:21.062
for Betazoids
than for other humanoids.

35:21.103 --> 35:25.802
I believe the beings
are using that frequency to...

35:25.841 --> 35:28.537
communicate telepathically.

35:28.577 --> 35:31.705
It is possible that this
telepathic communication

35:31.747 --> 35:32.771
is creating interference

35:32.814 --> 35:34.645
in the REM sleep
of other species.

35:34.683 --> 35:37.948
That would explain why the rest
of our crew is not dreaming.

35:37.986 --> 35:41.752
Counselor, what are these beings
trying to tell us?

35:41.790 --> 35:44.190
They're calling for help.

35:44.226 --> 35:47.957
I think they're trapped,
just like we are.

35:48.063 --> 35:52.432
"Eyes in the dark" could mean
this twin star system.

35:52.467 --> 35:55.595
Your hypothesis is
certainly plausible.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.974
There may be another ship

36:00.042 --> 36:01.737
on the other side of the fissure

36:01.777 --> 36:03.210
where we cannot detect it.

36:03.245 --> 36:06.681
Is there a way
we could block their signals?

36:06.715 --> 36:08.342
There is no technology

36:08.383 --> 36:11.079
to block telepathic
transmissions, Doctor.

36:11.119 --> 36:13.246
Maybe communication

36:13.288 --> 36:16.689
through dreams
can work both ways.

36:16.725 --> 36:19.193
I could try
and get them to stop.

36:19.227 --> 36:22.890
Perhaps we could accomplish
more than that.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.729
If there is another ship,
and we can reach them

36:25.767 --> 36:29.498
we might be able to coordinate
our efforts to free ourselves.

36:29.538 --> 36:31.335
It is conceivable.

36:31.373 --> 36:35.366
When working with patients
with debilitating nightmares

36:35.410 --> 36:38.573
I've often used
a therapeutic treatment

36:38.613 --> 36:40.843
called "directed dreaming."

36:40.882 --> 36:44.443
Dreamers can learn
to control their dreams

36:44.486 --> 36:49.082
retain a conscious memory,
even while in REM sleep.

36:49.124 --> 36:55.085
I could remember a short message
and deliver it to them.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.930
If it were possible,
what would you say?

37:02.204 --> 37:05.401
Working together with the aliens
we must discover a means

37:05.440 --> 37:07.465
by which we can produce
an explosion

37:07.509 --> 37:11.275
more intense than either one
of us could achieve alone.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.372
What is it you're looking for?

37:13.415 --> 37:15.883
These are the elements
we have available.

37:15.917 --> 37:17.248
Some of them could be used

37:17.285 --> 37:19.412
in the creation
of an explosive reaction.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.115
If we could communicate
this inventory

37:21.156 --> 37:23.454
to the other ship, perhaps
they would be able to...

37:23.492 --> 37:24.789
No, Data, no.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.919
This is too complex.

37:26.962 --> 37:30.830
It has to be a simple,
clear message.

37:30.866 --> 37:32.891
I am uncertain
if a simple transmission

37:32.934 --> 37:34.094
would be adequate.

37:35.704 --> 37:37.729
Stop.

37:37.773 --> 37:39.934
Go back.

37:40.041 --> 37:41.770
Further back.

37:41.810 --> 37:43.778
There. Stop.

37:43.812 --> 37:46.406
"One moon circles."

37:46.448 --> 37:48.075
Yes, Counselor.

37:48.116 --> 37:50.414
One electron circles one proton.

37:50.452 --> 37:52.420
This is a hydrogen atom.

37:52.454 --> 37:54.081
"One moon circles."

37:54.122 --> 37:57.922
That's what they've been
telling me over and over.

37:57.959 --> 38:01.019
Perhaps the aliens
are thinking as we are...

38:01.062 --> 38:03.656
to collaborate
in producing an explosion.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.893
If hydrogen is combined
with another element...

38:05.967 --> 38:10.233
calendenium, for example...
it is extremely volatile.

38:10.272 --> 38:13.571
But would the message mean
that they have hydrogen

38:13.608 --> 38:15.576
or they want hydrogen?

38:15.610 --> 38:19.068
Well, if it's a distress call,
I think they'd be asking

38:19.114 --> 38:22.083
for what they need,
not what they already have.

38:22.117 --> 38:23.914
Then the proper course
of action would be

38:24.019 --> 38:25.816
to release hydrogen
into the rift

38:25.854 --> 38:28.584
and hope they have a substance
that would detonate it.

38:31.026 --> 38:33.324
How do I tell them what to do?

38:33.361 --> 38:34.794
If you are correct, Counselor

38:34.830 --> 38:38.095
I believe they have
already told us what to do

38:38.133 --> 38:41.102
and are waiting for us to do it.

38:41.136 --> 38:43.832
When we are ready,
the only message

38:43.872 --> 38:46.932
you should attempt
to convey is "now."

38:46.975 --> 38:50.934
I can help keep you
in REM sleep for a while

38:50.979 --> 38:54.380
with this cortical scanner.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.146
It will maintain
electrical activity

38:57.185 --> 39:00.780
in your brain
at the proper frequency.

39:07.128 --> 39:09.096
Counselor

39:09.130 --> 39:11.655
you will have to communicate
with the other ship

39:11.700 --> 39:13.861
within two minutes
of entering REM sleep.

39:13.902 --> 39:15.529
Two minutes?

39:15.570 --> 39:17.231
Is that all, Data?

39:17.272 --> 39:18.899
Unfortunately, yes.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.602
We have only enough power
to emit a hydrogen stream

39:21.643 --> 39:23.042
for that amount of time.

39:23.078 --> 39:24.306
They must understand

39:24.346 --> 39:26.746
that they will have to detonate
it immediately.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.249
Captain, we are ready
to implement the plan.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.911
Proceed.

39:31.019 --> 39:35.251
We will have to draw power
from the life-support systems

39:35.290 --> 39:38.282
in order to discharge
the collectors.

39:43.865 --> 39:45.162
This is Acting Captain Data.

39:45.200 --> 39:48.761
All personnel will report
to the designated shelter areas

39:48.803 --> 39:50.327
immediately.

39:50.372 --> 39:52.135
Life-support systems
will continue

39:52.173 --> 39:54.300
only in emergency shelter areas.

39:55.510 --> 39:56.841
Hear that?

39:56.878 --> 40:00.177
Get us jammed
into shelter areas.

40:00.215 --> 40:03.241
We sit and wait to die.

40:03.285 --> 40:04.809
Nobody will ever find us.

40:04.853 --> 40:06.548
Relax, Gillespie.

40:06.588 --> 40:08.385
Everybody relax.

40:08.423 --> 40:10.948
Ten-Forward is
a designated shelter area.

40:11.026 --> 40:12.584
Relax.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.363
We want to die here
like helpless children?

40:17.399 --> 40:19.594
Security to Ten-Forward
immediately.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.124
We don't even know
what we're dying for.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.160
Sit down, Gillespie.
You're not helping matters any.

40:23.204 --> 40:26.173
What's wrong with standing up
for ourselves?

40:26.207 --> 40:27.174
Yeah.

40:27.208 --> 40:28.266
Right!

40:28.310 --> 40:29.971
Picard owes us some answers.

40:35.584 --> 40:37.313
Ooh, Gillespie!

40:44.993 --> 40:46.654
What is that?

40:46.695 --> 40:50.358
This is a little souvenir
I picked up from Magus III.

40:50.398 --> 40:52.195
That was setting number one.

40:52.233 --> 40:54.360
Anyone want to see
setting number two?

40:58.310 --> 41:01.074
PGO signals steady.

41:01.113 --> 41:04.310
Visual cortex showing
increased activity.

41:04.349 --> 41:07.318
Rapid eye movements commencing.

41:14.526 --> 41:16.153
Crusher to Bridge.

41:16.194 --> 41:18.128
She's in REM sleep.

41:18.163 --> 41:19.926
Thank you, Doctor.

41:19.998 --> 41:22.558
Activating Bussard collectors.

41:33.645 --> 41:35.476
Eyes... 

41:35.514 --> 41:36.947
in the dark. 

41:37.015 --> 41:39.745
Where are you?

41:42.788 --> 41:44.688
90 seconds remaining.

41:44.723 --> 41:47.692
One moon... 

41:47.726 --> 41:49.091
circles. 

41:49.127 --> 41:51.391
Where are you?!

41:51.430 --> 41:52.397
Eyes... 

41:52.431 --> 41:53.625
I have to find you!

41:53.665 --> 41:56.099
... in the dark. 

41:56.134 --> 41:58.796
I have to tell you.

42:02.841 --> 42:04.934
45 seconds remaining.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.307
One moon... 

42:10.349 --> 42:11.839
Please...

42:11.883 --> 42:13.145
... circles... 

42:13.185 --> 42:15.915
I must find you...

42:16.021 --> 42:18.182
to tell you.

42:19.257 --> 42:21.248
30 seconds remaining.

42:23.362 --> 42:25.159
Eyes... 

42:25.197 --> 42:27.222
in the dark... 

42:27.265 --> 42:29.324
One moon... 

42:35.841 --> 42:37.900
Ten seconds remaining.

42:44.449 --> 42:46.246
Nothing.

42:46.284 --> 42:48.047
No explosion.

42:48.086 --> 42:50.418
The Counselor was unsuccessful.

42:56.795 --> 42:58.956
Activate impulse engines.

42:59.031 --> 43:00.965
Engines activated, sir.

43:32.030 --> 43:34.089
We have cleared the rift, sir.

43:34.132 --> 43:37.590
Warp engines are
coming back on-line.

43:37.636 --> 43:39.604
Set a course to...

43:41.006 --> 43:44.066
Setting a course
for Starbase 220.

43:51.750 --> 43:56.744
Sir, as my final duty
as Acting Captain

43:56.788 --> 43:58.949
I order you to bed.

43:58.990 --> 44:02.187
I shall do the same
for all personnel.

44:02.227 --> 44:04.559
Very well, Mr. Data.

44:09.101 --> 44:11.695
And, Mr. Data...

44:11.736 --> 44:13.863
thank you.

44:13.905 --> 44:15.964
Pleasant dreams, sir.
