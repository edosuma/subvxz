WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.681
Previously on Nashville...

00:01.736 --> 00:03.379
- What?
- Sing to me.

00:03.402 --> 00:04.943
In the middle of the
living-room, with a whisk?

00:04.974 --> 00:05.952
You come crazy?

00:05.998 --> 00:08.689
You've just been nominated
for a C.M.A Award.

00:08.743 --> 00:11.382
I just got nominated for
female vocalist of the year.

00:11.902 --> 00:13.787
How would you like to come home with me?

00:14.311 --> 00:16.305
That's not a good idea.

00:16.329 --> 00:18.667
Looking at you, I don't
really see much of an outlaw.

00:18.706 --> 00:20.896
- Is this stuff true?
- You took Jason's song.

00:20.919 --> 00:22.507
It's just a song.

00:22.843 --> 00:25.197
Hello? Do you have any idea
what you've done to my daughter?

00:25.229 --> 00:27.615
Dante. What the hell do you want?

00:27.662 --> 00:28.866
What kind of tape?

00:30.291 --> 00:32.659
Thank you, Charlotte! Good night!

00:34.328 --> 00:36.713
Great show, as always.

00:36.747 --> 00:40.083
Thank you! Ooh, I am so
happy this leg is over.

00:40.117 --> 00:41.585
I can't wait to get home to the girls.

00:41.619 --> 00:43.220
And auditions, right?

00:43.254 --> 00:44.721
Pfft.

00:44.755 --> 00:46.973
Well, Marshall says we
gotta close the label deal

00:47.008 --> 00:48.475
by the end of the month.

00:48.509 --> 00:49.802
He... he can't just make up
some random deadline like that.

00:49.803 --> 00:51.467
Well, yeah, he can do that if he wants to.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.305
It's been a couple of months.

00:52.306 --> 00:53.394
We can't keep letting the "perfect"

00:53.395 --> 00:54.528
be the enemy of the "good."

00:54.563 --> 00:56.966
- But perfect is the enemy of the good.
- Mm.

00:56.984 --> 00:58.068
I'm not settling.

01:03.858 --> 01:06.326
How long we gonna have
to do this in private?

01:06.360 --> 01:08.612
Mmm.

01:08.646 --> 01:11.314
Just till I can tell the girls,

01:11.332 --> 01:12.499
get 'em used to you being around,

01:12.533 --> 01:14.534
professionally and privately.

01:14.585 --> 01:16.503
Mmm.

01:16.537 --> 01:17.820
Does that sound good?

01:17.838 --> 01:20.507
Yep.

01:20.541 --> 01:21.758
You know, speaking of professionally,

01:21.792 --> 01:23.710
um...

01:23.761 --> 01:26.429
My whole work schedule just
really loosened up, right?

01:26.464 --> 01:28.448
Yeah.

01:28.482 --> 01:29.966
Maybe we could do both.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.451
Wanna come over to my house
for dinner tomorrow night?

01:31.485 --> 01:32.886
You, me, and the girls?

01:32.920 --> 01:34.087
Thank you, Charlotte!

01:34.121 --> 01:35.171
- You guys are the best!
- I'd love to.

01:35.206 --> 01:36.523
Good night!

01:36.557 --> 01:37.941
Mmm.

01:40.828 --> 01:42.295
Okay. Here we go.

01:47.985 --> 01:49.719
- What?
- What?

01:49.754 --> 01:50.987
What do you mean "what"? You were smirkin'.

01:51.022 --> 01:52.973
I... I'm not smirkin'.

01:53.024 --> 01:55.392
It's just, you're working on a
new song. I think that's cool.

01:55.426 --> 01:58.578
- Am I?
- You've been humming that same thing for days.

01:58.613 --> 02:01.047
That's what I do when I got
something new stuck in my head.

02:01.082 --> 02:02.999
You know, you should
probably get it down on paper

02:03.034 --> 02:05.368
before it disappears.

02:05.386 --> 02:09.055
You know, you did a great
job playing the other night.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.625
I woulda told you myself, but...

02:11.659 --> 02:13.226
you kind of bailed on me.

02:13.261 --> 02:14.811
Was that because they told
you to stay away from me

02:14.845 --> 02:16.896
or because you couldn't keep up?

02:16.948 --> 02:21.051
I bailed 'cause it seemed
like you were a little...

02:21.085 --> 02:23.153
over-served.

02:23.187 --> 02:25.822
That is a very ballsy
thing to say to your boss.

02:25.856 --> 02:30.593
You are lucky you're cute
enough to get away with it.

02:30.627 --> 02:32.779
You wanna help me get
those lyrics down on paper

02:32.813 --> 02:33.930
before they disappear?

02:35.499 --> 02:37.417
I'll take that as a "yes."

02:44.241 --> 02:45.809
Are you ever gonna have

02:45.843 --> 02:47.944
a recording session
that doesn't end at dawn?

02:50.114 --> 02:52.098
We work till the music feels right.

02:52.149 --> 02:53.500
Yeah, the only reason
you're working on that

02:53.534 --> 02:55.168
is because that producer
guy has got you thinking

02:55.202 --> 02:56.536
you're some kind of outlaw.

02:56.570 --> 02:58.455
Well, maybe I am some kind of outlaw.

02:58.489 --> 03:00.373
Yeah, a tickly one.

03:00.408 --> 03:02.392
He just thinks working on this image

03:02.410 --> 03:05.111
will create some attention...

03:05.146 --> 03:07.180
not just locally but for labels, too.

03:07.214 --> 03:08.248
Okay.

03:08.282 --> 03:09.549
What's with all the dresses?

03:09.583 --> 03:11.801
I'm playing at the Opry. Remember?

03:11.819 --> 03:14.571
Of course I do.

03:14.605 --> 03:16.072
I also remember...

03:16.090 --> 03:18.124
there's gonna be thousands
of people there watching ya.

03:18.159 --> 03:20.143
And your debut's a big deal.

03:20.177 --> 03:23.446
Jack. Hey, man.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.551
Seriously?

03:28.585 --> 03:30.303
Well, hell, yeah.

03:30.338 --> 03:32.689
- Bye.
- What's that?

03:32.723 --> 03:34.324
Uh, it's, uh, Vandy Radio.

03:34.358 --> 03:36.926
They want me to go in to do
some kind of show tomorrow.

03:36.944 --> 03:38.528
- Really?
- Apparently, everyone's calling in,

03:38.596 --> 03:39.963
asking for my song to be played.

03:39.997 --> 03:41.631
Baby, that is so good! Well done!

03:41.665 --> 03:42.949
All right.

03:42.983 --> 03:44.200
Okay.

03:44.235 --> 03:45.752
Are you going again right now?

03:45.803 --> 03:47.904
Yeah, Jack needs me to go...

03:47.938 --> 03:49.639
- Prep or something.
- So...

03:49.673 --> 03:52.058
Uh, do you have any
idea when you'll be back?

03:52.093 --> 03:54.110
Soon.

03:54.144 --> 03:56.429
And... I vote the blue dress.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.032
Bye.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.819
- Hi.
- He looks like

04:02.853 --> 04:05.455
he hasn't slept or showered in like a week.

04:05.489 --> 04:07.290
You know, I couldn't tell if he had.

04:08.652 --> 04:10.537
You ready for your big Opry debut?

04:10.571 --> 04:12.338
No. Thanks for for asking.

04:12.389 --> 04:14.157
Come on. You gonna knock 'em dead.

04:14.191 --> 04:15.758
Handpicked by Rayna Jaymes?

04:15.793 --> 04:17.277
Got to.

04:17.327 --> 04:19.712
So, uh, is she just introducing you

04:19.747 --> 04:21.231
or... her label, too?

04:21.265 --> 04:23.099
No, she has to pick one more act

04:23.134 --> 04:25.401
before she can officially launch the thing.

04:25.436 --> 04:26.870
But, um...

04:26.904 --> 04:30.473
she's having some secret
session at sound check tomorrow.

04:30.491 --> 04:32.442
If she finds the right person,

04:32.476 --> 04:36.062
she'll announce us
both, or it's just... me.

04:36.096 --> 04:37.163
Yeah.

04:37.198 --> 04:39.082
Teddy's moving forward

04:39.116 --> 04:42.068
with this new parcel he's
chosen for the stadium site,

04:42.102 --> 04:44.537
which leaves us with a prime
piece of real estate to develop.

04:44.572 --> 04:46.873
- Retail.
- I'm thinking mixed use high-rise.

04:46.907 --> 04:48.691
What do you think?

04:48.726 --> 04:50.693
Daddy?

04:50.728 --> 04:52.479
Sorry. What?

04:52.530 --> 04:55.014
We were just talking about
the next step for our land.

04:55.049 --> 04:58.017
Albert wants retail. I
want mixed use high-rise.

04:58.052 --> 05:00.603
No. Baseball stadium.

05:00.638 --> 05:03.189
I'll talk to my friends
on the zoning commission.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.327
You tried that already. That didn't work.

05:07.361 --> 05:10.647
You think I don't remember
who I've talked to?

05:10.681 --> 05:13.700
I'm just sayin', I'm gonna
try again. That's all.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.084
And I'm saying that I think that

05:15.118 --> 05:17.187
that's a battle that we've already lost.

05:18.521 --> 05:20.907
Are you sure you really
feel up to being this...

05:20.958 --> 05:22.058
involved?

05:25.930 --> 05:28.397
You like that?

05:30.000 --> 05:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:37.291 --> 05:39.609
He's agreed to give us the S.D. Card.

05:39.643 --> 05:40.743
For how much?

05:40.778 --> 05:42.078
$2 million.

05:42.112 --> 05:44.330
I'd suggest letting me
try to negotiate him down.

05:44.365 --> 05:49.035
No. I want that video,
and I want it destroyed...

05:49.069 --> 05:50.803
before the C.M.A. Awards.

05:50.838 --> 05:52.805
Juliette, my professional advice?

05:52.840 --> 05:53.923
Get this guy locked up.

05:53.941 --> 05:55.058
Are you kidding? No!

05:55.092 --> 05:57.627
No reports, no cops, no scandals.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.329
Nothin'!

05:59.363 --> 06:01.381
Is that not why I hired you?

06:06.787 --> 06:08.704
Baby, is there anything that I can do?

06:08.722 --> 06:12.926
Mama, I just need to be left alone. Okay?

06:16.647 --> 06:18.348
So you haven't found a
second act yet, right?

06:18.382 --> 06:21.100
No. Don't you get any ideas.

06:21.151 --> 06:23.119
Oh. I'm looking for a guy anyway.

06:23.153 --> 06:24.287
- What about Deacon?
- Hi.

06:24.321 --> 06:25.321
- He is a guy.
- Hey.

06:25.356 --> 06:26.773
- Hi.
- It's true.

06:26.824 --> 06:28.875
I think my mom's looking
for someone a bit younger.

06:28.926 --> 06:30.260
- Oh, wow.
- Oh!

06:30.294 --> 06:31.761
No offense or anything.

06:31.779 --> 06:34.013
No offense taken, but
you do not get any pie.

06:34.048 --> 06:36.232
- Oh, that's a beautiful pie. Thank you for bringing that.
- Made that myself.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.300
- Smells delicious.
- Beautiful.

06:37.334 --> 06:38.685
Hey, what can I do to help?

06:38.736 --> 06:39.836
You know what you can do?
You can take these people

06:39.870 --> 06:41.588
in the other room, keep 'em occupied

06:41.622 --> 06:43.222
- so mama can get dinner done.
- All right. Let's go, people.

06:43.274 --> 06:44.012
You're going to play a song with us.

06:44.013 --> 06:45.935
I don't know. I saw y'all
in New York do "Ho Hey."

06:46.218 --> 06:48.203
I'm pretty intimidated you
might blow me out of the water.

06:48.237 --> 06:50.171
Okay, so does that mean
that you know the song?

06:50.205 --> 06:51.990
Yeah, I can probably pick it out.

06:52.024 --> 06:53.908
Maybe you should just play.
I'm really not that great.

06:53.926 --> 06:55.043
Oh, the hell you're not.

06:55.077 --> 06:56.528
- Language.
- Oh, sorry.

06:56.562 --> 06:58.913
Wow. It's true, though. She's better than

06:58.948 --> 07:00.732
half the session musicians I play with.

07:00.766 --> 07:02.083
Really?

07:02.118 --> 07:03.268
Absolutely, yeah.

07:03.302 --> 07:04.686
Tell you what... you start off,

07:04.720 --> 07:06.504
and, uh, I'll come in behind you.

07:12.695 --> 07:15.697
♪ I've been trying to do it right ♪

07:15.731 --> 07:18.082

Hey, dad!

07:33.068 --> 07:34.402
Hey, honey.

07:34.453 --> 07:36.821
Dad. What's going on here?

07:36.855 --> 07:39.507
We were just making some
dinner. Surprised to see you.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.309
Yeah, well, Maddie left
her soccer gear in the car.

07:41.343 --> 07:43.478
I figured she'd need it
for her game tomorrow.

07:44.930 --> 07:45.980
Can I have a word with you?

07:46.015 --> 07:48.533
Yep.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.387
What the hell is this?

07:52.438 --> 07:53.838
I thought I made my decision clear.

07:53.856 --> 07:55.173
And I walk my the house,
and he's just sittin' here?

07:55.207 --> 07:56.907
Teddy, we are getting a divorce.

07:56.926 --> 07:58.243
This is not your call.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.645
You didn't want them around
Peggy, and I honored that.

08:00.679 --> 08:02.030
I don't want my daughters around him.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.031
You were having an affair.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.365
So were you, emotionally,

08:04.400 --> 08:05.650
the entire time that we were married.

08:05.684 --> 08:07.035
Don't you try to rewrite history.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.186
Daphne was not exactly born
out of a shell of a marriage.

08:09.204 --> 08:12.040
We loved each other,
all right? That changed.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.241
Those girls are always
gonna be your daughters,

08:13.292 --> 08:14.375
but don't you think you can come in here

08:14.410 --> 08:16.995
and dictate what my life is gonna be.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.503
Everything okay?

08:28.223 --> 08:30.174
Yeah.

08:30.208 --> 08:37.376
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:44.217 --> 08:46.751
These are some of the
lyrics that I was working on.

08:46.802 --> 08:48.086
All right.

08:48.137 --> 08:51.056
Do you remember the melody I was humming?

08:51.090 --> 08:53.374
Yeah. It was kind of a
love song vibe, right?

08:53.392 --> 08:54.809
Uh, no.

08:54.844 --> 08:56.561
I'm not interested in love songs.

08:56.596 --> 08:58.212
Country music staple, isn't it?

08:58.231 --> 09:02.067
It's hard to write about
things you don't believe in.

09:02.101 --> 09:03.902
You don't believe in love?

09:03.936 --> 09:05.904
Well, let's put it this way...

09:05.938 --> 09:07.289
pretty much everybody

09:07.323 --> 09:10.408
that has told me they loved
me in my life has lied.

09:10.443 --> 09:13.061
I don't know if it was me or...

09:13.079 --> 09:16.431
they just weren't capable of it. I...

09:18.000 --> 09:19.834
the point is,

09:19.869 --> 09:22.170
I'm pretty damn sure it doesn't exist.

09:22.204 --> 09:24.422
It does.

09:24.457 --> 09:25.924
I've been in love.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.592
And how did that go for ya?

09:31.180 --> 09:33.014
Thanks for coming in today.

09:33.049 --> 09:34.549
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

09:38.638 --> 09:41.106
No. No.

09:41.140 --> 09:42.824
- They're all really talented guys.
- Yeah.

09:42.858 --> 09:44.643
I'm just not... I'm not feeling it.

09:44.694 --> 09:46.027
- Star power.
- Right.

09:46.062 --> 09:47.979
We gotta find the right
person. All right, 0 for 10.

09:48.030 --> 09:50.315
- Tomorrow's another day.
- Okay.

09:50.366 --> 09:51.983
Excuse me, Ms. Jaymes?

09:52.034 --> 09:53.318
- Yeah?
- Name's Will Lexington.

09:53.369 --> 09:54.753
We met the other night
at the Edgehill party.

09:54.787 --> 09:56.655
I'm Scarlett's friend.

09:56.706 --> 09:57.939
Right. I remember.

09:57.974 --> 09:59.291
Well, you'll remember me
for a lot more than that

09:59.325 --> 10:00.542
if you allow me five minutes of your time.

10:00.576 --> 10:02.027
Hey, I'm sorry. Will, is it?

10:02.061 --> 10:04.296
Listen, why don't you just,
uh, let us listen to your demo

10:04.330 --> 10:05.947
and then we'll circle back to you, okay?

10:05.965 --> 10:07.966
Look... look, I... I've
been waiting outside till

10:08.000 --> 10:10.602
you saw everybody you needed
to see before busting in here.

10:10.636 --> 10:11.953
And I'm pretty sure you didn't find

10:11.971 --> 10:13.221
anything close to what you're looking for.

10:13.255 --> 10:15.557
Well, we saw a lot of talented guys today.

10:15.591 --> 10:17.392
No, you saw a lot of guys in
boots they bought downtown.

10:17.426 --> 10:18.560
What you haven't seen

10:18.594 --> 10:20.295
is somebody who can actually rope a steer.

10:21.447 --> 10:23.148
You're listening to Vandy Radio,

10:23.182 --> 10:25.467
and I'm here with local
artist Gunnar Scott.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.819
Tell us what inspired your
song "Gun for a mouth."

10:27.853 --> 10:29.788
Just kinda...

10:29.822 --> 10:31.072
came to me one night.

10:31.107 --> 10:33.241
It feels a little outside the law,

10:33.275 --> 10:34.326
a little dangerous.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.277
I like to do what I want.

10:36.311 --> 10:38.196
Just trying to get that into my music.

10:38.207 --> 10:40.542
That must affect your romantic life.

10:40.576 --> 10:41.743
Do you wanna comment on that?

10:41.777 --> 10:44.045
Let's just say I do what I want there, too,

10:44.080 --> 10:45.664
if you get what I mean.

10:45.698 --> 10:48.416
Gunnar's gonna be performing tomorrow

10:48.450 --> 10:50.001
at the bar on 2nd.

10:50.052 --> 10:51.836
That's enough of that.

We gotta get his demo to Marshall.

11:54.533 --> 11:57.118

- Find it.

12:01.991 --> 12:04.459
Tell me you've got the video.

12:04.493 --> 12:05.710
He never showed up.

12:05.745 --> 12:08.096
Why don't you just call him?

12:08.130 --> 12:09.881
Why don't we think about that? Oh, right.

12:09.915 --> 12:13.084
Because he uses a different
disposable phone every day.

12:13.119 --> 12:14.552
He may have gotten spooked,

12:14.587 --> 12:15.587
or maybe something happened to him.

12:15.621 --> 12:16.838
Maybe he got hit by a bus,

12:16.872 --> 12:18.189
and all my problems will be solved.

12:21.177 --> 12:23.111
I don't recognize the number.

12:23.145 --> 12:25.814
- Put it on speaker.
- Hello?

12:25.848 --> 12:27.515
I know I'm supposed to talk to
your security guy or whatever,

12:27.549 --> 12:29.584
but I figured I'd cut through the red tape.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.519
- What do you want?
- Well, I... I went to the spot,

12:31.554 --> 12:33.455
saw your guy there with the briefcase

12:33.489 --> 12:34.672
with the $2 million. He was on time.

12:34.707 --> 12:35.974
That's all great,

12:36.008 --> 12:37.909
but that's when I
realized I made a mistake.

12:37.943 --> 12:39.094
The price is going up.

12:39.128 --> 12:40.495
I'm gonna need $10 million.

12:40.529 --> 12:42.914
You're insane.

12:42.948 --> 12:44.666
Well, somebody out there
understands the value

12:44.700 --> 12:45.884
of this thing on the Internet.

12:45.918 --> 12:47.886
And I know how important
the C.M.As are to you.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.337
$10 million.

12:49.371 --> 12:50.822
Tomorrow,

12:50.856 --> 12:52.724
same place, or you're not gonna like

12:52.758 --> 12:55.310
the questions you get on the red carpet.

12:57.346 --> 12:58.530
It would've just been cheaper

12:58.564 --> 13:01.950
for you to go to A.A.
like every other addict.

13:04.820 --> 13:07.789
As key members of the board,
I felt it was important

13:07.823 --> 13:09.624
that you know where the company stands

13:09.675 --> 13:11.943
from my perspective as C.F.O.

13:11.994 --> 13:15.513
And the truth is, I fear
we're at a crossroads.

13:15.581 --> 13:18.066
Yes, my father has
survived his heart attack,

13:18.100 --> 13:20.468
but he's a long way from full recovery.

13:20.503 --> 13:21.770
Cut to the chase, Tandy.

13:21.804 --> 13:23.238
Are you asking for our support

13:23.272 --> 13:26.007
if you make a motion to replace lamar?

13:26.041 --> 13:27.776
I'm asking for your support

13:27.810 --> 13:31.129
should my father decide to
transition to chairman emeritus.

13:31.163 --> 13:32.847
If he "decides"?

13:32.882 --> 13:35.283
What you really want is
for us to endorse a coup.

13:35.317 --> 13:37.485
Well, someone has to
protect Wyatt Industries

13:37.520 --> 13:38.703
and all its holdings.

13:38.737 --> 13:41.639
I'm not sure this is
pure concern on your part.

13:41.674 --> 13:44.342
But given Lamar's age and circumstance,

13:44.393 --> 13:47.028
it's clear a change should be made.

13:47.062 --> 13:49.981
Let's make sure we do this with grace.

13:50.015 --> 13:53.485
Nobody wants to feel stabbed in the back...

13:53.519 --> 13:55.587
even if that's what's happening.

14:05.397 --> 14:06.731
Nice interview.

14:06.782 --> 14:08.900
You were listening?

14:08.951 --> 14:10.685
Yep. Tend to support the people I'm dating,

14:10.703 --> 14:12.820
but according to you, we're not
dating, so that was pointless.

14:12.838 --> 14:14.255
I'm just... I'm...

14:14.290 --> 14:15.373
What, doing what you want?

14:15.424 --> 14:16.757
Trying to build a following, all right?

14:16.775 --> 14:18.109
- Jack says if I can...
- I don't care what Jack says.

14:18.144 --> 14:20.394
I care about you.

14:20.412 --> 14:23.064
And I don't understand this
whole thing you're doing.

14:23.098 --> 14:24.582
I don't... I don't get it.

14:24.617 --> 14:26.484
What? It's... it's not a big deal.

14:26.519 --> 14:29.103
It's stolen lyrics, a whole new wardrobe,

14:29.138 --> 14:30.755
and a fake past.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.273
It's not all fake, Scarlett. You know that.

14:32.308 --> 14:35.693
You walked away from the kind
of life that your brother led

14:35.728 --> 14:37.378
because you know that
it only ends in grief.

14:37.413 --> 14:39.614
You might wanna consider doing that again.

14:39.648 --> 14:42.133
And, you know, if the Opry
is not outlaw enough for you,

14:42.168 --> 14:43.701
you don't have to come. That is fine.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.354
Oh.  Come on.

14:48.307 --> 14:50.542
Scarlett.

14:50.576 --> 14:51.826
You know I would never miss it.

15:06.942 --> 15:08.993
We gotta get him vetted, but he is our guy.

15:09.044 --> 15:11.245
With a... with a week to spare.

15:11.263 --> 15:12.897
Yeah.

15:12.948 --> 15:14.015
In fact, tonight,

15:14.049 --> 15:15.266
when I introduce Scarlett at the Opry,

15:15.301 --> 15:17.018
I'm just gonna go ahead
and announce the new label.

15:17.052 --> 15:18.586
Sure. I don't know about his name, though.

15:18.604 --> 15:20.989
- Lexington? It's like a...
- Lexington is such a good Southern name.

15:21.023 --> 15:22.073
- You think?
- Yes!

15:22.124 --> 15:23.575
- Rayna Jaymes?
- Yes.

15:23.626 --> 15:25.860
You've been served.

15:25.878 --> 15:27.378
What?

15:32.468 --> 15:34.535
What's it say?

15:34.553 --> 15:36.671
It says I'm not allowed to have the girls

15:36.705 --> 15:39.724
within 100 feet of Deacon Claybourne.

15:44.717 --> 15:46.001
A restraining order?

15:47.720 --> 15:49.154
I took the necessary action
to protect my children.

15:49.172 --> 15:51.223
Deacon has been around our
girls their entire lives.

15:51.257 --> 15:52.324
Yeah, and so have I, but I'm not anymore,

15:52.358 --> 15:53.842
and I'm not gonna take the chance

15:53.876 --> 15:55.661
that without me there to
safeguard their well-being...

15:55.695 --> 15:57.195
Oh, no, this has nothing
to do with the girls.

15:57.230 --> 15:59.248
This is about your ego and your fear.

15:59.282 --> 16:01.700
No, Rayna. I'm doing this
because I don't trust you.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.169
This is never gonna stick.

16:04.203 --> 16:07.422
I'm the mayor of this city.
So trust me, it'll stick.

16:07.473 --> 16:09.358
What happened to you?

16:09.392 --> 16:12.344
I took your father's
advice, and I grew a pair.

16:25.575 --> 16:28.760
Long time, pretty lady.
Glad to sse you back.

16:28.794 --> 16:30.279
You got the oxy?

16:30.330 --> 16:32.531
I do. One moment.

16:36.435 --> 16:38.837
- How much?
- $30 a pop.

16:43.693 --> 16:45.594
I need something else, too.

16:50.683 --> 16:52.551
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:52.585 --> 16:54.252
Last night was a lot of fun, wasn't it?

16:54.287 --> 16:56.388
- It was.
- How'd Teddy take it after?

16:56.406 --> 16:59.124
He didn't take it great. He has issued

16:59.158 --> 17:01.243
- a temporary restraining order.
- What?

17:01.277 --> 17:04.029
Yeah, I'm not allowed to have
the girls within 100 feet of you.

17:04.063 --> 17:05.213
Are you kidding me?

17:05.248 --> 17:09.067
You know, he's... hurt. Lashing out.

17:09.101 --> 17:11.369
- Crazy.
- I still see you, right?

17:11.404 --> 17:12.160
Mm-hmm.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.847
Am I gonna see you at the
C.M.A. rehearsals today?

17:14.156 --> 17:15.691
- Yeah, you will.
- All right.

17:15.724 --> 17:17.075
I'll see you there.

17:17.109 --> 17:19.594
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

17:19.628 --> 17:21.596
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

17:21.631 --> 17:23.682
- Mom?
- Hey.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.467
Who were you just talking to?

17:25.501 --> 17:27.102
You just standing there, eavesdropping?

17:27.136 --> 17:29.588
No. But I heard you say, "I love you."

17:29.622 --> 17:31.890
Why don't you come sit?

17:37.246 --> 17:40.465
Um...

17:40.500 --> 17:41.767
I was talking to Deacon.

17:42.969 --> 17:45.287
Since you heard all that, uh, you...

17:45.321 --> 17:47.989
I want you to know that we
are... we're seeing each other.

17:48.024 --> 17:49.758
You used to date him,

17:49.792 --> 17:51.976
- right before you married dad.
- Mm-hmm.

17:51.994 --> 17:54.129
Is that why dad got so mad
when he saw Deacon here?

17:55.681 --> 17:58.016
You know, hon, all this stuff
that you're asking me about?

17:58.034 --> 18:00.302
It's really grown-up stuff.

18:00.336 --> 18:03.071
And it's private.

18:03.106 --> 18:05.607
So I want you to trust me

18:05.658 --> 18:06.725
that when I think you're old enough,

18:06.759 --> 18:07.943
I'm gonna tell you all about it.

18:12.198 --> 18:14.165
Guess what?

18:14.183 --> 18:16.618
- I auditioned for Rayna Jaymes.
- What?

18:16.669 --> 18:18.470
I showed up at that private
session you told me about.

18:18.504 --> 18:20.438
- Oh, my God. I did not tell you to do that.
- No, it's fine.

18:20.456 --> 18:22.958
She remembered I went to the,
uh, Edgehill party with you.

18:23.009 --> 18:25.727
And, uh...

18:25.762 --> 18:27.295
I'm pretty sure she liked me.

18:27.330 --> 18:29.931
Oh! Damn, you have got some moxie.

18:29.982 --> 18:31.983
And you're just being yourself, aren't you?

18:32.018 --> 18:33.918
- That's refreshing.
- Meaning what?

18:33.936 --> 18:35.070
I don't know.

18:35.104 --> 18:36.621
- Did you hear Gunnar on the radio?
- No.

18:36.655 --> 18:37.889
I did.

18:37.924 --> 18:41.476
It's like this whole outlaw
thing has gone way too far.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.979
Well, maybe you could talk
to him. He listens to you.

18:44.030 --> 18:45.397
I don't know, Scarlett.

18:45.431 --> 18:47.182
You used my name to go see Rayna Jaymes.

18:48.684 --> 18:49.835
It's the least you could do.

18:51.203 --> 18:52.971
All right.

18:54.724 --> 18:56.491
Thank you.

19:02.181 --> 19:03.365
"Juliette, did you know that

19:03.399 --> 19:05.767
the C.M.A. Award for
vocal group of the year

19:05.818 --> 19:07.335
has been won seven times by female groups?"

19:07.370 --> 19:11.072
Uh... wait. Do I really have to say that?

19:11.124 --> 19:12.224
We'd like for you to stick to the script

19:12.258 --> 19:13.325
if at all possible, Ms. Barnes.

19:13.359 --> 19:14.609
Really?

19:14.660 --> 19:17.229
Even if it's dumb? I
mean, who talks like that?

19:17.263 --> 19:19.531
Let's take it from the top, okay?

19:19.565 --> 19:21.500
Oh. Uh, okay.

19:21.534 --> 19:23.435
"Juliette, did you know that

19:23.469 --> 19:24.619
the C.M.A. for vocal group of the year

19:24.670 --> 19:26.471
has been won seven times by female groups?"

19:26.506 --> 19:28.857
"Hmm. Maybe we should form a group."

19:28.891 --> 19:30.525
"Well, you know I'd love to,

19:30.560 --> 19:32.861
but I think I'm washing
my hair that night."

19:32.895 --> 19:34.496
Pause for laughter, then...

19:34.530 --> 19:36.398
"This year, the nominees are... "

19:36.432 --> 19:37.866
I'm sorry. This is stupid.

19:37.917 --> 19:40.101
It's just stupid.

19:40.136 --> 19:44.356
Okay. Let's take a break.

19:47.793 --> 19:49.010
Oh, what, are y'all together now?

19:49.045 --> 19:50.662
We've always been friends.

19:50.696 --> 19:52.481
- Uh-huh.
- Water?

19:52.532 --> 19:53.949
Mm-hmm. Thank you very much.

19:53.983 --> 19:56.334
- Appreciate that.
- Uh, this water's too warm.

19:56.368 --> 19:58.136
Are you new or incompetent?

19:58.171 --> 19:59.354
I'm... I'm sorry, Ms. Barnes.

19:59.405 --> 20:00.489
Are you kidding me?

20:00.523 --> 20:02.073
Complaining about the water and the lines?

20:02.108 --> 20:03.308
Can you be professional for once?

20:03.326 --> 20:04.442
You know what? I will,

20:04.476 --> 20:05.694
when I get a little respect around here,

20:05.728 --> 20:06.795
whether it be from the P.A.

20:06.829 --> 20:08.747
or the country music association.

20:08.781 --> 20:09.814
You gotta earn that.

20:09.849 --> 20:10.866
Let me tell you a little secret...

20:10.900 --> 20:12.884
if you do happen to win that award,

20:12.919 --> 20:14.920
it doesn't mean you've earned anything.

20:25.515 --> 20:29.734
♪ a-well, rich man, poor
man, beggarman, thief

20:29.769 --> 20:33.238

Thank you.

20:59.882 --> 21:01.683
Join me at the bar, buy me a shot,

21:01.717 --> 21:03.501
stick around for some more.

21:11.627 --> 21:13.445
What the hell you doing here?

21:13.479 --> 21:16.514
Thought I'd come check out
your show, see how you're doin'.

21:16.549 --> 21:17.599
You know, this probably ain't

21:17.633 --> 21:19.017
the best place for you to be right now.

21:20.686 --> 21:22.287
What's that supposed to mean?

21:22.321 --> 21:23.821
That hat and that buckle.

21:23.839 --> 21:25.507
It's not your scene, man.

21:26.725 --> 21:29.194
Yeah, well, I got news for ya.

21:29.228 --> 21:31.263
Probably not the best
place for you, either.

21:33.749 --> 21:35.367
You know what? I wanna do this, okay?

21:35.401 --> 21:36.685
I have to do this.

21:36.719 --> 21:38.203
So why don't you back
off, let me finish my set

21:38.237 --> 21:40.204
so I can get to the Opry
to see Scarlett, okay?

21:40.222 --> 21:42.807
You gonna show up like this?

21:42.842 --> 21:44.108
Where'd you do time?

21:45.277 --> 21:46.377
What?

21:46.395 --> 21:48.063
All that singing about prison...

21:48.097 --> 21:50.882
what I wanna know is where you did time.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.785
Or if you even did.

21:53.819 --> 21:55.770
You know what?

21:55.805 --> 21:57.072
It's none of your damn business.

21:57.106 --> 21:58.573
That's what I thought.

21:58.624 --> 22:00.258
You think you're some kind
of tough guy. Give me a break.

22:00.292 --> 22:02.994
Hey, hey, buddy. Why don't you just, uh...

22:03.029 --> 22:04.229
keep your mouth busy

22:04.263 --> 22:06.715
with the cheap beer you've been sucking on?

22:06.766 --> 22:07.966
Hey!

22:15.858 --> 22:17.642
Your accountant said to come
up with the $10 million in cash,

22:17.660 --> 22:19.644
you'd have to liquidate
some of your securities...

22:19.662 --> 22:22.280
several stocks, bonds, mutual funds.

22:22.315 --> 22:23.948
But that would do it.

22:23.966 --> 22:26.067
Yes, but will it satisfy him?

22:26.118 --> 22:27.585
Addicts are never satisfied.

22:27.620 --> 22:29.387
She would know.

22:29.422 --> 22:31.589
He's never gonna stop, is he?

22:31.624 --> 22:33.508
You don't deserve this.
You don't deserve any of it.

22:33.542 --> 22:35.794
You didn't do anything wrong.

22:35.828 --> 22:37.228
So I'll go ahead and set up the exchange?

22:38.597 --> 22:39.898
No.

22:42.101 --> 22:44.569
Let him sell the video.

22:44.603 --> 22:46.938
Call "The View." Tell them
I have an exclusive for 'em.

22:46.972 --> 22:48.506
If the world's gonna find out,

22:48.541 --> 22:50.341
- they might as well hear it from me.
- Baby, you don't want this.

22:50.359 --> 22:52.811
What... what about your new
album? What about the C.M.As?

22:52.845 --> 22:54.612
Mama, they've already
counted the votes, okay?

22:54.630 --> 22:56.381
I either won or lost.

22:56.399 --> 22:59.934
- But, baby...
- Look, this way, he makes less money, okay?

22:59.969 --> 23:03.138
And the world just finds
out what they already know.

23:03.172 --> 23:05.256
I'm a train wreck.

23:07.293 --> 23:08.593
Y'all can go.

23:09.928 --> 23:12.080
You, too, mama.

23:12.131 --> 23:16.101
I'm gonna take a bath,
clear my head for tomorrow.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.662
Look at you... reading, drinking tea.

23:48.696 --> 23:50.797
I think Tandy's right.
You are starting to relax.

23:50.831 --> 23:53.049
Your sister just likes to think

23:53.084 --> 23:55.568
she knows me better than I know myself.

23:55.586 --> 23:57.337
Uh, sit down, please.

23:57.355 --> 23:59.055
Thanks.

23:59.106 --> 24:00.473
I can only stay a second.

24:00.491 --> 24:03.560
I'm on my way over to the Opry, so...

24:03.611 --> 24:05.161
I realize I have not asked you for a favor

24:05.212 --> 24:07.013
since I was 16 years old.

24:07.031 --> 24:08.748
I am well aware of that.

24:08.782 --> 24:10.667
Yeah, well...

24:10.701 --> 24:12.435
Uh...

24:12.470 --> 24:14.871
Teddy has, uh...

24:14.906 --> 24:17.057
served me with a restraining order.

24:17.091 --> 24:21.811
He wants to force me to
keep the girls away from...

24:21.846 --> 24:22.996
Deacon.

24:23.030 --> 24:26.750
Honey, his rationale doesn't matter to me.

24:26.784 --> 24:28.201
Don't you worry about it.

24:28.219 --> 24:30.737
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

24:30.771 --> 24:31.888
That's what happens

24:31.923 --> 24:34.841
when you move 'em up the ranks quickly.

24:34.875 --> 24:37.861
They get too big for their britches.

24:37.895 --> 24:39.562
Well, it's gonna be a great night.

24:39.614 --> 24:40.847
You're gonna be amazing out there

24:40.865 --> 24:42.832
with this, uh, incredible band in there.

24:42.883 --> 24:45.302
- Hi!
- Hey.

24:45.336 --> 24:46.803
You're gonna have such a good time,

24:46.837 --> 24:47.988
you're gonna forget
there's even an audience.

24:48.022 --> 24:49.088
I highly doubt that.

24:49.106 --> 24:50.290
Hey, Steve. How you doing, man?

24:50.324 --> 24:51.524
- Deacon. How are you?
- I'm good. Good to see you.

24:51.542 --> 24:53.292
- Good to see you.
- Scarlett, welcome to the Opry.

24:53.311 --> 24:54.594
Mr. Buchanan, such a pleasure to meet you.

24:54.628 --> 24:55.729
Thank you for having me.

24:55.763 --> 24:56.896
- Please, call me Steve.
- Okay.

24:56.914 --> 24:58.564
So this is the "into the
circle" dressing room,

24:58.582 --> 25:00.650
reserved for artists
making their Opry debut.

25:02.069 --> 25:03.169
- That's you.
- Okay.

25:03.237 --> 25:04.404
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you, Steve.

25:04.422 --> 25:05.555
- Thanks, Steve.
- Good to see ya.

25:09.476 --> 25:11.394
I don't feel like I belong here.

25:11.429 --> 25:14.113
I'm pretty sure they all felt that way.

25:14.131 --> 25:16.816
But you do.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.034
And I'm proud of you.

25:18.069 --> 25:20.053
Thank you.

25:20.087 --> 25:21.388
Just your mama could've been here.

25:21.422 --> 25:24.207
Me, too. Her boss is such a jerk, but...

25:24.241 --> 25:25.625
she needs that job, so...

25:25.659 --> 25:27.260
Yeah. Well, if it's any consolation,

25:27.294 --> 25:28.395
I'm here.

25:28.429 --> 25:29.663
I'm so glad.

25:29.730 --> 25:31.114
Girl, you are shakin'.

25:31.148 --> 25:32.598
Yeah.

25:32.616 --> 25:34.351
Look, I'm gonna go get you

25:34.385 --> 25:36.186
- some of that herbal tea you like, all right?
- Peppermint.

25:36.237 --> 25:38.121
- All right. Peppermint. Okay.
- Thank you.

25:38.155 --> 25:39.773
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:47.114 --> 25:48.531
Hey, it's Gunnar. Leave a message.

25:48.566 --> 25:50.216
Hi, baby, it's me.

25:50.251 --> 25:53.636
If you're out in the audience
or... or somethin' close by,

25:53.671 --> 25:55.872
can you give me a call so I can...

25:55.906 --> 25:59.626
bring you backstage? 'Cause I...

25:59.660 --> 26:02.595
I just really, really,
really want you here.

26:02.613 --> 26:04.414
Okay, I love you. Bye.

26:04.465 --> 26:05.715
- Scarlett O'Connor?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.467
Guy in the audience asked
me to give this to you.

26:07.485 --> 26:09.269
Thank you.

26:23.534 --> 26:25.952
What time do you think it is?

26:28.422 --> 26:31.424
She's probably just about to go onstage,

26:31.442 --> 26:33.009
if that's what you mean.

26:59.537 --> 27:00.737
Juliette?

27:00.771 --> 27:04.174
No. She changed her mind.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.558
She's not giving you any... anymore,

27:05.592 --> 27:07.794
now that you've raised the price.

27:07.828 --> 27:09.028
Jolene?

27:09.063 --> 27:10.280
I've got the...

27:10.314 --> 27:11.464
$2 million

27:11.499 --> 27:13.566
that her guy was gonna bring you yesterday.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.818
If you come over, I'll...

27:14.852 --> 27:16.786
give it to you if you
give me that S.D. thingy.

27:16.821 --> 27:18.588
Why should I trust you?

27:18.622 --> 27:20.840
She triggered you.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.809
I don't want her getting away with that.

27:22.843 --> 27:24.761
I don't want her...

27:24.795 --> 27:27.547
shuttin' you out like she does to me.

27:27.581 --> 27:28.832
Then why do you want that S.D. card?

27:30.701 --> 27:32.118
'Cause I love you. I love you.

27:32.153 --> 27:34.404
And I always have.

27:34.455 --> 27:36.739
And the thought of you
being with her sexually...

27:36.774 --> 27:39.042
makes me sick.

27:42.413 --> 27:43.696
Where you at?

27:43.730 --> 27:46.483
Somebody that I trusted

27:46.517 --> 27:49.419
videotaped us sleeping together.

27:49.453 --> 27:52.822
And then he tried to blackmail me,

27:52.857 --> 27:55.291
hoping that I would do anything

27:55.326 --> 27:59.129
to make sure that footage
never wound up on the Internet.

27:59.163 --> 28:00.763
I've made a lot of mistakes,

28:00.798 --> 28:02.682
but this time,

28:02.716 --> 28:05.018
I'm not so different from...

28:05.052 --> 28:08.838
anybody else out there.

28:08.873 --> 28:10.623
I fell for the wrong man,

28:10.658 --> 28:12.292
and, uh...

28:12.326 --> 28:14.060
he broke my heart.

28:14.094 --> 28:15.578
That was amazing.

28:15.613 --> 28:17.747
How you feel about it?

28:17.781 --> 28:19.365
Uh, embarrassed.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.450
Stupid.

28:20.501 --> 28:22.018
Well, you shouldn't.

28:22.052 --> 28:25.505
For what it's worth, you're
the bravest person I know.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.708
Thanks.

28:33.731 --> 28:35.014
I wanted to come out tonight

28:35.032 --> 28:36.716
because I wanna make a
very special announcement,

28:36.750 --> 28:38.501
and I wanted my friends here at the Opry

28:38.552 --> 28:40.203
to be the first to hear.

28:40.237 --> 28:42.555
I'm about to launch a
brand-new record label

28:42.590 --> 28:44.440
called Highway 65 Records.

28:46.260 --> 28:48.194
This is a lifelong dream of mine,

28:48.229 --> 28:50.113
and I'm just so excited about it.

28:50.147 --> 28:53.483
And, uh, I have a very
special guest here that

28:53.517 --> 28:56.603
I would like for you to give
a very warm Opry welcome to.

28:56.637 --> 28:59.756
She is a wonderful, exciting new artist,

28:59.790 --> 29:02.709
and her name is Scarlett O'Connor.

29:05.946 --> 29:07.397
Hi!

29:07.448 --> 29:09.933
Oh! Thank you.

29:09.967 --> 29:12.569
Oh.

29:12.603 --> 29:15.004
Hi!

29:15.039 --> 29:16.656
It's such an honor to
stand here on this stage

29:16.674 --> 29:18.942
in front of y'all. Thank
you so much for having me.

Thank you so much!

31:30.207 --> 31:32.492
Thank you, guys.

31:33.961 --> 31:36.129
Thank you.

31:37.498 --> 31:39.415
Good night, Nashville.

31:45.872 --> 31:47.673
You're high.

31:48.842 --> 31:50.193
So are you.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.512
I didn't come here to
reconnect. Where's the money?

31:52.546 --> 31:54.346
Where's the S.D. card?

31:54.365 --> 31:55.748
Money first.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.414
Actually, you're not gettin' a cent.

32:11.448 --> 32:12.632
What are you doing, Jolene?

32:12.666 --> 32:14.450
Sparing my daughter the humiliation

32:14.485 --> 32:16.536
of having to go on television

32:16.570 --> 32:19.622
and explain to people
what you've done to her.

32:19.673 --> 32:21.740
That's your plan? I can sell this thing

32:21.759 --> 32:23.209
and have it all over the Internet

32:23.243 --> 32:24.844
before you can snort another pill.

32:24.878 --> 32:26.796
Give me the S.D. card.

32:26.830 --> 32:29.215
Don't be stupid, Jolene.

32:45.574 --> 32:47.609
Your Honor, my children
call him "Uncle Deacon."

32:47.643 --> 32:48.743
But he's not their Uncle.

32:48.777 --> 32:50.111
Well, he's not a threat, either.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.931
The mayor alleges that Mr.
Claybourne is an alcoholic.

32:52.965 --> 32:54.248
He's a recovering alcoholic.

32:54.266 --> 32:55.717
He has not had a drop in 13 years.

32:55.751 --> 32:58.269
Your Honor, I've included
a magazine article

32:58.304 --> 33:00.288
in my complaint which disputes that.

33:00.322 --> 33:02.140
A hearing within a day of being served?

33:02.191 --> 33:05.159
I wonder whose daddy got
us on the docket so quickly.

33:05.177 --> 33:07.929
Mr. Wyatt did place a call to my chambers,

33:07.963 --> 33:10.231
saying that both his daughter and the mayor

33:10.266 --> 33:11.265
would prefer privacy in this matter.

33:11.283 --> 33:12.750
How thoughtful of him.

33:15.154 --> 33:17.505
Okay. After careful review, I've determined

33:17.539 --> 33:20.024
that this case requires
more than any sort of...

33:20.075 --> 33:22.310
temporary action or sidebar could solve.

33:22.344 --> 33:23.745
Plus I'm gonna reset

33:23.779 --> 33:25.296
your custody arrangement
without restrictions

33:25.331 --> 33:28.783
and dissolve this
temporary restraining order.

33:28.817 --> 33:30.685
We'll revisit this in
full court in two weeks.

33:30.719 --> 33:32.036
I'll see you both then.

33:32.071 --> 33:34.956
Thank you, sir.

33:36.625 --> 33:38.543
There are several issues in front of us

33:38.577 --> 33:41.929
that materially affect
the future of this company.

33:41.964 --> 33:43.564
Daddy.

33:43.599 --> 33:48.086
I've missed one too many of these meetings.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.589
It's, uh... high time I came back to work,

33:51.624 --> 33:52.774
don't you all think?

33:57.245 --> 33:59.147
You seem to be in my seat.

34:07.790 --> 34:10.141
Now...

34:10.175 --> 34:12.393
where were we?

34:12.428 --> 34:14.344
Hmm?

34:14.380 --> 34:17.882
It's your mother, but you're
on in five at "The View."

34:17.916 --> 34:20.601
Hold on. Where the hell have you been?

34:20.636 --> 34:22.036
Baby, I'm sorry.

34:22.070 --> 34:24.572
Look, I know I've always
been a disappointment to you.

34:24.590 --> 34:26.806
- I know that.
- Ma, what's wrong?

34:26.824 --> 34:29.476
Um... look, you gotta promise me

34:29.495 --> 34:33.081
you're not gonna go on that show, okay?

34:33.114 --> 34:36.217
Why... are you at the apartment?

34:36.251 --> 34:37.168
Are you using?

34:38.920 --> 34:40.355
You know, I don't know if I ever told you,

34:40.389 --> 34:43.291
but when you were a little
girl, you had this...

34:43.324 --> 34:47.661
this... beautiful light about you.

34:47.696 --> 34:50.782
Mama?

34:59.975 --> 35:03.211
Cancel "The View."

35:07.266 --> 35:09.767
Thanks for having my back back there, man.

35:09.802 --> 35:12.270
I'm sorry it landed us here.

35:15.107 --> 35:16.758
Oh.

35:16.792 --> 35:19.243
Not my first time in jail.

35:19.278 --> 35:21.796
Probably not my last.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.297
Doesn't seem much like you, though.

35:23.315 --> 35:24.582
Yeah.

35:24.616 --> 35:27.535
I don't know what's like me anymore.

35:30.389 --> 35:33.691
Hey, man, I'm really sorry about...

35:35.744 --> 35:39.547
hat thing I did.

35:39.581 --> 35:41.616
I overreacted.

35:42.885 --> 35:47.305
I was just, uh... surprised.

35:47.339 --> 35:48.790
Yeah. Yeah.

35:48.824 --> 35:49.941
Yep.

35:51.610 --> 35:55.162
You know, when I was
17, my dad caught me...

35:55.180 --> 35:57.048
with a friend.

35:57.082 --> 36:01.068
He... grabbed my ass,
threw me in the truck.

36:01.103 --> 36:02.870
He drove me out to the
middle of the nowhere,

36:02.905 --> 36:05.973
told me to explain myself.

36:05.991 --> 36:09.744
I told him I couldn't,

36:09.778 --> 36:11.979
'cause I don't know what
was going on with me.

36:12.014 --> 36:13.681
He told me...

36:13.699 --> 36:17.969
"can't live under my roof
while you figure it out."

36:22.808 --> 36:25.176
So what'd you do then?

36:25.210 --> 36:28.579
Oh, I hitched a ride to Abilene, got a job,

36:28.614 --> 36:32.733
bought a guitar. I haven't been home since.

36:32.768 --> 36:35.803
You ever figure out the
answer to his question?

36:35.838 --> 36:44.712
Shoot, man. All I know
is, uh, only time I'm happy

36:44.746 --> 36:48.416
is when I'm up onstage playing and singing.

36:51.253 --> 36:53.171
I'm gonna be a country music star.

36:55.574 --> 36:58.292
I'll do whatever it takes to get there.

36:58.327 --> 37:00.394
Me, too.

37:06.385 --> 37:08.469
Mama?

37:08.504 --> 37:10.438
Mama?

37:21.216 --> 37:23.301
Oh, no, no, no, no.

37:23.352 --> 37:24.519
Mama?

37:24.553 --> 37:26.888
Mama! Wake up!

37:26.922 --> 37:28.689
Mama?

37:30.559 --> 37:32.226
Mama!

37:35.364 --> 37:38.449
No!

38:12.545 --> 38:14.063
So they dropped the charges?

38:14.097 --> 38:15.247
Nope.

38:15.281 --> 38:19.001
You're getting bailed out.

38:22.756 --> 38:25.090
I'm-a pay you back.

38:31.114 --> 38:32.698
Thank you.

38:32.732 --> 38:34.216
You're welcome.

38:35.819 --> 38:37.436
Come on.

38:39.672 --> 38:42.775
- Look, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Please, I'm so tired. I'm so tired...

38:42.809 --> 38:45.477
- I didn't mean for it to happen.
- I've tried fix it, and I can't.

38:45.512 --> 38:47.112
What do you mean?

38:47.147 --> 38:51.383
If I'm gonna bail you out,
then I can't be around this.

38:51.418 --> 38:53.202
What?

38:53.236 --> 38:55.337
I can't be with you like this.

38:55.388 --> 38:56.955
No.

38:56.990 --> 38:58.207
- Yeah.
- No.

38:58.241 --> 39:02.277
I know you love him,
and I know you miss him.

39:02.328 --> 39:04.146
Look at where we are.

39:09.535 --> 39:11.520
- Look, wait. No, you need to...
- No, no.

39:11.571 --> 39:14.873
I fell in love with you, not your brother.

39:14.891 --> 39:19.862
♪ what we were

39:23.500 --> 39:26.769
♪ dry your eyes

39:26.803 --> 39:28.520
A tragic turn in the life

39:28.538 --> 39:31.340
of country-pop diva Juliette Barnes.

39:31.374 --> 39:32.741
The singer's troubled mother,

39:32.792 --> 39:35.110
long-term drug user Jolene Barnes,

39:35.195 --> 39:36.879
is suspected of shooting and killing

39:36.913 --> 39:39.198
sober companion Dante Rivas,

39:39.232 --> 39:42.734
before overdosing in an
apparent murder-suicide.

39:42.769 --> 39:45.220
Police insist the investigation is ongoing,

39:45.255 --> 39:47.990
but there is speculation
that both Rivas and Barnes

39:48.024 --> 39:50.542
were under the influence of narcotics...

40:10.313 --> 40:11.580
Hey.

40:13.233 --> 40:14.633
What do you want?

40:14.667 --> 40:17.820
I wanna talk to you.

40:17.904 --> 40:20.956
I want us to try to come to
some kind of understanding

40:20.990 --> 40:22.991
like reasonable people.

40:23.026 --> 40:27.479
I know you're scared. I
know what you're scared of.

40:27.514 --> 40:29.814
You will always be Maddie's father.

40:29.833 --> 40:32.351
- You're damn right.
- I know.

40:32.385 --> 40:34.436
You trusted me her whole life

40:34.487 --> 40:38.257
to not do anything to compromise
your relationship with her.

40:38.291 --> 40:41.693
You gotta keep trusting me.

40:41.711 --> 40:43.595
I will not harm that.

40:51.604 --> 40:52.788
Okay.

40:52.822 --> 40:56.108
Thank you.

40:56.142 --> 40:58.443
Talia?

40:58.477 --> 40:59.862
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:59.913 --> 41:02.147
It's just that I found this paternity test,

41:02.165 --> 41:05.500
and...

41:11.875 --> 41:15.294
I don't think that my dad is my father.
