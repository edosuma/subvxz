00:01.280 --> 00:02.952
l'm sure she's a lovely girl, Mom. . .

00:03.120 --> 00:05.953
. . .but l have a strict policy
against blind dates.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.716
Yes, l know l'm not God's gift
to women, but nevertheless.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.516
Oh, come on, how do you know what
she can suck through a garden hose?

00:16.560 --> 00:18.516
lt doesn't matter, the policy stands.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.432
Okay, bye.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.355
You know, while l applaud
your blind date policy. . .

00:23.520 --> 00:26.910
. . .l would encourage you to consider
a garden hose exemption.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.278
l'm sorry, but you remember
the last time l let Mom fix me up.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.715
Oh, yeah, the enema freak.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.118
She was a colonic irrigation therapist.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.919
Tomato, tomahto.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.955
You still wound up with five gallons
of coffee up your keister.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.232
Not a pleasant memory.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.834
Oh, l can't remember it
without chuckling.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.713
These days they'll open
a Starbucks anywhere.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.998
-Are you done?
-No, wait, one more.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.313
You had the Venti nonfat
crap-puccino. . .

01:00.440 --> 01:01.873
. . .with extra foam.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.798
No, okay, l'm done.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.518
So, what's wrong with the TV?

01:07.640 --> 01:11.269
The storm last night messed up the
satellite dish. l'll call the guy on Monday.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.035
That's your answer for everything.
''Call the guy. ''

01:14.240 --> 01:17.516
Not for everything.
Often, l'll call the girl.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.035
Of course there was the one time
that the girl turned out to be the guy.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.034
Needless to say,
l got a full cash refund.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.671
You don't have to call
the guy this time.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.990
You adjust the dish
till the signal clears up.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.236
Which is what the guy
will do on Monday.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.674
But Jake is coming tonight.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.832
Do you wanna listen to him complain
about the TV all weekend?

01:37.000 --> 01:40.310
l can deal with Jake. lt's your whining
that makes me wanna hang myself.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.199
Come on, help me get the ladder.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.920
l'll go up on the roof
and we'll fix it in five minutes.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.159
l have a ladder?

01:49.640 --> 01:51.676
How did l get a ladder?

01:52.280 --> 01:55.272
For the life of me,
l can't remember buying a ladder.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.392
Well, apparently you did.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.595
But why?

01:58.760 --> 02:01.354
-And how did l get it home?
-l really couldn't tell you.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.113
Did l rent a truck?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.029
Who knows?

02:05.400 --> 02:08.073
l'm telling you,
we got a real mystery on our hands.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.437
Yeah, it's a puzzler.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.670
Now, l'm gonna go up
and adjust the dish. . .

02:12.840 --> 02:16.071
. . .and you go look at the TV
and tell me when the picture improves.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.389
All right.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.278
l still think we should call the guy.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.192
Will you forget the guy?

02:21.360 --> 02:22.588
l'm the guy.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.036
-Charlie.
-Yeah?

02:30.200 --> 02:31.952
There's a pair of panties up here.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.678
Of course, the ladder.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.390
-Alan, mystery solved.
-What?

02:40.840 --> 02:43.877
Never mind. Focus on the job at hand.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.110
-Are you watching the TV?
-Yes.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.269
How does it look now?

02:47.640 --> 02:48.914
lt's a little better.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.115
How about now?

02:50.240 --> 02:51.639
No, no, no. That's worse.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.637
-Move it the other way.
-What?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.711
l said, move it the other way.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.474
-There, there, there. That's perfect.
-What?

02:58.640 --> 03:00.358
l said that's perfect.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.318
Great. Coming down.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.037
Did you say something?

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.040 --> 03:34.474
l told you.
We should have called the guy.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.433
Oh, you wanna flip me the bird,
but the poor little fellow can't fly.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.599
Just help me lie down.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.429
-There is a bright side here, you know.
-Oh, really?

03:48.560 --> 03:52.599
Really? And what might the
bright side be? Handicapped parking?

03:57.120 --> 03:59.076
Pity sex?

04:00.600 --> 04:03.637
You know, l can see there's gonna be
no talking to you about this.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.997
Oh, do me a favor and call Judith
and tell her not to bring Jake over.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.633
How come?

04:08.960 --> 04:10.029
Look at me, Charlie.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.351
l have abrasions, contusions,
a severely sprained neck. . .

04:13.480 --> 04:16.517
. . .two fractured fingers,
and l'm hopped up on pain pills.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.910
Does that spell weekend dad to you?

04:19.079 --> 04:20.274
Actually, to me it spells:

04:20.440 --> 04:22.874
''Weekend in Bangkok
with two Olympic gymnasts. ''

04:25.400 --> 04:27.550
But that's a whole other story.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.591
Look, l got no plans for the weekend.
l could take care of Jake.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.116
-Bangkok?
-lt was the '80s.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.508
A simpler time.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.029
The dollar was strong.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.993
l was looking forward to hanging out
with the knucklehead.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.593
Let him come over.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.115
l can't help you.
What will you do all weekend?

04:47.280 --> 04:49.236
l don't know.
Hey, maybe l'll get a chute.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.709
We could play Chutes and Ladders.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.669
You see. See, that's why l want Jake
here. He has a sense of humor.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.308
Oh, all right.
lf you think you can handle it.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.198
Don't worry,
l got everything covered.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.913
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.150
ls there anything l can do
for you now?

05:11.480 --> 05:12.595
Well, l gotta pee.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.513
Yeah, so?

05:16.680 --> 05:19.877
So l can't undo my pants. . .

05:20.280 --> 05:21.838
. . .or anything.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.511
Where are we headed with this, Alan?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.469
You said you'd help me.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.915
l was thinking like
l could make you a sandwich.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.469
-Charlie!
-Hey, l am not reaching into your pants.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.955
Well, what am l supposed to do?

05:35.200 --> 05:36.758
Go stand in the surf.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.753
Come on, grow up.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.797
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.234
Now, come on and unzip me.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.631
Just like that? Right to it?
No dinner? No movie?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.392
Charlie!

05:50.120 --> 05:51.792
Hold on.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.992
Coming.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.719
Holy God.

06:19.320 --> 06:23.029
Charlie, can you get the door?

06:24.880 --> 06:25.995
Charlie?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.678
Hang on.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.916
Charlie!

06:34.840 --> 06:39.118
Oh, great,
l think l just punctured a lung.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.750
''Don't worry, Alan.
l've got everything covered. ''

06:52.640 --> 06:53.789
l'm coming.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.355
You need to start your report
this weekend.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.431
Why?
lt's not due till next Wednesday.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.790
-l've plenty of time.
-You said that last time.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.439
-No, l didn't.
-Yes, you did.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.716
l think you're getting senile.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.119
Watch your mouth, young man.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.953
l can't watch it. lt's under my nose.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.670
-Hello.
-What happened to you?

07:34.120 --> 07:38.318
Well, most recently,
l was hit in the head by a door.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.678
But before that, l was fixing
the satellite dish on the roof. . .

07:41.840 --> 07:43.512
. . .and l kind of fell.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.312
Why didn't you just call the guy?

07:49.400 --> 07:52.710
For God's sake, Alan, how do you intend
to look after him this weekend?

07:52.880 --> 07:57.351
l am in excruciating pain,
but l appreciate your concern.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.872
Oh, well, you could've picked up
a phone and given me a heads up.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.234
Pick up the phone?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.790
Judith, l needed barbecue tongs
to take a leak.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.358
Can you look after Jake or not?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.670
-Charlie said he'd look after him.
-Like hell.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.395
There's no way l'll let your degenerate
brother be responsible for my son.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.039
Sure, don't ask me what l want.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.909
Just boss me around
like you're my boss or something.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.391
Charlie will be fine.
Have a good weekend.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.428
Thanks.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.952
You too.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.948
Hey, can we go out to dinner tonight?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.429
Do l look like l'm in any shape
to go to dinner?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.034
l don't know. l'm not a doctor.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.556
-The answer is no.
-Okay.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.512
Then can we go to the video store
and rent the new ''Final Fantasy''?

08:45.680 --> 08:48.274
Jake, l hurt myself.
l'm in a lot of pain.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.671
So? When l took a soccer ball
to the nads, l was in a lot of pain. . .

08:51.840 --> 08:54.513
. . .and all my coach said was,
''Walk it off. ''

08:55.600 --> 08:57.636
Well, you can't just walk this off.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.518
Not with that attitude.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.511
Hey, there he is.
How's it going, buddy?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.029
My life stinks.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.758
Cheer up, you're still a kid.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.150
lt's gonna get much worse.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.431
-Where have you been?
-Taking a nap.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.271
-Why?
-l find it refreshes me.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.635
You said you were gonna take care
of everything.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.994
Yeah, so?

09:19.160 --> 09:21.799
So while you were sleeping,
l had to answer the door.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.599
Do you realize how petty
you sound right now?

09:25.160 --> 09:28.118
-Relax, lie down, l got it covered.
-No, you don't.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.158
Nothing is covered. lt's all coverless.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.873
Now, there is a life that stinks.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.752
What's the agenda?
What do you want?

09:36.920 --> 09:40.390
-l wanna go out to dinner.
-Yeah, well, l want my own talk show.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.788
You'll eat what we've got.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.109
Why can't we go out?

09:44.040 --> 09:46.634
Alan, l can't deal with this.
Talk to your son.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.677
That's it? You're done covering?

09:48.840 --> 09:51.070
l didn't know
he was gonna be impossible.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.596
-Don't talk about me like l'm not here.
-Keep yapping and you won't be.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.710
-Charlie, just take him to dinner.
-Why should l?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.751
He's not gonna shut up till he gets it.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.751
That's true. l'll drive you crazy.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.073
Yeah, well, do your worst.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.629
lf we go out to dinner,
there's nothing to clean up.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.869
We're not going out.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.560
-You usually wanna go out to dinner.
-Not tonight.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.150
You're not punishing me,
you're just punishing yourself.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.550
Back off, bobblehead.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.278
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.237
-We're not going.
-Why not?

10:24.400 --> 10:27.870
-This conversation's over.
-Not if l keep talking.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.238
So where do you wanna eat?

10:32.680 --> 10:33.715
Clucky's.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.589
What's Clucky's?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.193
Zesty fire-roasted chicken. . .

10:37.320 --> 10:40.676
. . .with Grandma Clucky's
secret herbs and spices.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.071
All right, where is it?

10:43.240 --> 10:45.515
There's several convenient locations.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.908
Like where?

10:47.120 --> 10:48.758
l don't know. l just sit in the car.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.792
l've never seen a Clucky's here.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.029
-How about a pizza?
-No.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.189
-Burgers?
-No.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.349
Sushi?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.033
-ltalian? Chinese?
-No.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.189
-Clucky's?
-No.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.554
You're not even listening.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.233
l mean yes.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.833
Clucky's.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.276
l'm not driving all over the city
hoping to stumble across a Clucky's.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.556
This isn't the Clucky's my mom
takes me to.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.073
No kidding.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.673
Where are we anyway?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.951
lt's called Watts.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.954
Hurry up and finish your chicken.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.678
l like the Cajun Clucky's better.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.909
Good for you.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.152
-Can l go back and get Cajun Clucky's?
-No, eat what you got.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.756
-But l like the Cajun Clucky's.
-Why did you order the regular Clucky's?

11:37.920 --> 11:40.070
Because l forgot
l like the Cajun Clucky's.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.471
Oh, just eat the freaking chicken.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.519
Fine.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.876
Why do you say freaking?
l know what you mean.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.235
-l'm not a little kid anymore.
-Eat.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.879
Don't talk. Eat!

12:03.200 --> 12:04.758
What's up?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.678
l gotta pee.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.396
Charlie, get the tongs.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.471
Charlie?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.637
Gotta pee, gotta pee,
Gotta pee, pee, pee

12:31.800 --> 12:33.074
Gotta pee, pee, pee

12:33.240 --> 12:35.629
Gotta pee, gotta pee,
Gotta pee, pee, pee, gotta pee

12:35.880 --> 12:38.997
Alan, l've got somebody
who wants to meet you.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.557
Not a good time, Mom.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.117
Yes, l can see that.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.395
Are you all right?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.470
No, not really.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.669
Oh, my poor baby.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.195
Well, anyway, Mona, Alan.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.429
Alan, Mona.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.873
Hi, Mona.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.828
Hello. What happened to you?

13:11.200 --> 13:14.272
l was fixing a satellite dish
and l fell off the roof.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.870
Well, why didn't you just call the guy?

13:18.480 --> 13:20.596
You wanna know
why l didn't call the guy?

13:20.760 --> 13:22.796
l'll tell you why l didn't call the guy.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.791
Because you don't need
to call the guy.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.349
lt's a simple adjustment
that any idiot can do.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.829
And, yes, l know,
this idiot fell off the roof. . .

13:30.000 --> 13:35.233
. . .but it was after l fixed it
all by myself, no guy.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.511
Okay, the ice has been broken.
l'll just give you Mona's number. . .

13:39.680 --> 13:42.399
. . .and you can call her some time
when it's more convenient.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.629
Come along, dear.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.831
Do you just stay awake nights. . .

13:46.960 --> 13:49.349
. . .trying to think of new ways
to embarrass me?

13:52.960 --> 13:54.439
Still gotta pee.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.238
Oh, God.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.795
Oh, what the hell.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.469
Oh, yeah.
The Cajun Clucky's is way better.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.513
l'll notify Zagats.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.834
Before we stop at the video store,
can we get ice cream?

14:17.000 --> 14:20.390
-Who said we're stopping?
-l wanna rent the new ''Final Fantasy. ''

14:20.560 --> 14:22.471
Yeah, well, l want my
$80,000 Mercedes. . .

14:22.600 --> 14:24.750
. . .not to smell like chicken.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.990
But life is full
of little disappointments.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.197
Okay, forget the ice cream.
We'll just stop at the video store.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.715
Jake, l'm tired, l've got a headache.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.634
l just paid $ 1 00 to get
my car back from the ''chicken valet. ''

14:37.760 --> 14:39.273
And l wanna go home.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.035
Please?

14:41.360 --> 14:43.794
l'm sorry. What part of no
did you not understand?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.712
The ''nnn'' or the ''ooo''?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.715
How about if we stop
in front of the store. . .

14:49.880 --> 14:52.713
. . .l'll run in, get the video game,
and you wait in the car?

14:52.880 --> 14:54.791
How about we stop
by the video store. . .

14:54.960 --> 14:57.155
. . .and l just stuff you
through the return slot?

14:57.680 --> 14:58.795
l wouldn't fit.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.757
Try me.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.070
Oh, come on,
it will only take a minute.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.516
You might be able to bully your parents
into doing whatever you want. . .

15:06.680 --> 15:08.238
. . .but when l say no, that's it.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.437
Okay. Then l guess l won't have
a video game to play this weekend.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.710
Exactly.
You'll find something else to do.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.916
Right. lt will just be you and me.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.839
-They're all out of ''Final Fantasy. ''
-So get something else.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.877
But l want ''Final Fantasy. ''

15:26.040 --> 15:28.031
Are you telling me that out
of this store. . .

15:28.200 --> 15:32.079
. . .thousands of movies and video games,
there's nothing here that interests you?

15:32.240 --> 15:34.117
You're not gonna like the answer.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.518
l'm having chest pains.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.675
You're giving me chest pains.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.828
l bet they have ''Final Fantasy''
at another store.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.394
You want a final fantasy?

15:46.680 --> 15:50.195
Close your eyes and imagine yourself
flying across a freaking video store. . .

15:50.360 --> 15:52.316
. . .because that's what's about
to happen.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.833
Again with the freaking.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.951
Excuse me, but did l hear you say
you were looking for ''Final Fantasy''?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.476
l was about to return one,
you can have it.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.119
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.633
-Oh, he's really something, isn't he?
-Oh, yeah, he's something.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.274
The question is, what?

16:11.040 --> 16:12.473
l have a boy his age.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.278
-Single mom.
-Single uncle.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.229
-Betsy.
-Charlie.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.430
-Jake.
-Nobody asked you.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.436
Betsy, maybe we can get
the boys together. . .

16:21.600 --> 16:23.238
. . .for a little play date some time.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.709
l don't want a play date
with some stupid kid. . .

16:25.880 --> 16:27.632
. . .just so you can have sex with her.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.148
lsn't he something?

16:35.720 --> 16:38.314
Yeah. Well, it was nice meeting you.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.873
Bye-bye.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.875
What?

16:46.040 --> 16:47.234
Are you happy?

16:50.480 --> 16:51.913
Pretty much. You?

17:18.880 --> 17:21.030
Hello.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.756
''Controlled substance.

17:28.920 --> 17:33.277
Do not exceed one pill
every six hours. ''

17:33.440 --> 17:35.192
Yeah, right.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.315
What fresh childproof hell is this?

17:46.760 --> 17:49.069
Come on, you bastard.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.832
Yes.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.676
-What are we doing?
-l'm taking you back to your mother.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.789
Why?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.589
Why? l'll tell you why.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.194
Because you're no fun anymore.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.715
Because the whole
''isn't he cute'' thing is over.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.037
l tell you, if this is a prelude
to what you'll be as a teenager. . .

18:21.200 --> 18:23.077
. . .then we've got a serious problem.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.709
Whatever.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.630
You see, right there,
that attitude does not fly with me.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.392
Whatever.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.111
God, l hope that's the chicken.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.033
She's not home.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.552
Do not ''ha-ha'' me.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.358
Never ''ha-ha'' me.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.078
Judith, come get your kid.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.476
Don't hide behind the couch.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.949
l can see you, Judith.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.836
Hey, how about some ice cream?

19:19.560 --> 19:20.709
Sure.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.955
Listen, l'm sorry l lost my temper.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.032
Sorry you slipped in dog crap
chasing me.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.993
Thank you.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.752
Now, you know that l love you. . .

19:32.920 --> 19:36.037
. . .but we gotta be clear
on a couple of things.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.589
l get that you're growing up,
your body's changing. . .

19:38.760 --> 19:40.079
. . .your emotions are in flux.

19:40.200 --> 19:45.479
But the important thing you need to keep
in mind is that l don't care.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.915
When you're in my house,
when you're out with me. . .

19:50.080 --> 19:52.071
. . .and especially
when we're around women. . .

19:52.240 --> 19:54.800
. . .you will be adorable, got it?

19:55.640 --> 19:56.993
l'm trying to concentrate.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.239
Don't shush me. Never shush me.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.629
Whatever.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.469
Please be the chicken.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.675
Pour me one of those, will you?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.949
You know, mixing those pills
with alcohol is a really bad idea.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.434
Not if you're trying to die.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.159
Hey, how many of those pills
you got left?
